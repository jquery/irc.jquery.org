[00:54:04] <stede> need some help with ui-tabs: how to get the whole tab-area (tag <li>) clickable instead of the link only?!
[00:57:46] <seutje> stede: don't put padding on the li but put it on the a?
[00:58:07] <seutje> make it block level if necessary
[00:59:05] <stede> seutje, i will test it ...
[01:00:47] <stede> seutje, ok .. i put my fixed width/height i wan tto have on the <a> .. now it works
[01:00:49] <phrearch> how would it be possible, that when i have two instances of (http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476872/), when i call the reload function of instance A, it uses the ctx of instance B?
[01:01:47] <seutje> stede: wonderful! although I wouldn't use fixed width/height but instead, I'd use padding and let the element expand naturally
[01:02:48] <stede> seutje, hehe ... I (!) would do that to, but if my boss want its the fixed way ...
[01:02:57] <stede> he should get it
[01:03:07] <seutje> damn those bosses
[01:03:09] <phrearch> ah think i forgot one last var in the namespace
[01:03:11] <stede> :-P
[01:03:11] <seutje> damn them all to hell!
[01:03:26] <HardPhuck> I need a query expert for a small task - for money
[01:03:31] <stede> why use it the easy way instead of the bullshit-one?
[01:03:36] <HardPhuck> PM me
[01:16:02] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/zKRYG/show/ vs. http://jsfiddle.net/zKRYG/89/show/ <--- how's the show/hide animation working for you in fullscreen mode? Which one works best?
[01:22:41] <loui> hello. Has anyone tested the jquery.validate plugin as per http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation  instructions?
[01:23:36] <loui> I tried to make validate() work for a form, but with no luck..
[01:23:56] <ravenzz> mekwall maybe the 2nd is more fluid
[01:24:00] <ravenzz> maybe
[01:25:11] <loui> any help?
[01:25:37] <ravenzz> mekwall I would add some optional parameters to choose which kind of animation the user prefer
[01:28:13] <ravenzz> and also, when the dialog pops up/the windows is resized, you can calculate its height and replace position:absolute with position:fixed if $(dialog).height() < $(window).height()
[01:35:18] <mekwall> ravenzz: you can already choose what animation to have, it's the same as jquery ui dialog
[01:35:38] <mekwall> ravenzz: but you can also pass a function so you can have fully customized animations
[01:36:12] <mekwall> ravenzz: about the positioning, still working on it
[01:37:18] <ravenzz> k
[01:37:33] <ravenzz> also why don't redefine the alert() ?
[01:37:38] <Xotix> why would i get sortable() is not a function?  jquery included properly, newest version with all ui elements.
[01:37:46] <ravenzz> so each alert() will be replaced by yours?
[01:43:48] <loui> sorry for repeating, but is there any help for implementing validation through jquery validate plugin as in http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation (1st) example?
[01:45:21] <mekwall> ravenzz: because it doesn't work the same
[01:45:29] <ravenzz> mekwall http://jsfiddle.net/w7xeE/1/ :?
[01:45:30] <mekwall> ravenzz: alert() and confirm() are both blocking
[01:45:36] <ravenzz> uhm
[01:45:50] <stede> if i have <td class="foo"></td> how to select the previous col?
[01:45:57] <mekwall> code after alert() will not be executed until you close the alert
[01:46:58] <mekwall> stede: .prev()
[01:47:02] <mekwall> ?.prev @ stede
[01:47:03] <bot-t> stede, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[01:47:37] <stede> and $("td.foo").prev().each( ...) would work?
[01:47:54] <mekwall> no, .prev only return one element
[01:47:54] <stede> eh .. iw ill simpel check it while setting backgroudn color
[01:48:12] <stede> so .each().prev( ..) might work
[01:48:12] <lucian> hello. how can i pass arguments to a jquery widget plugin?
[01:48:19] <aaronmcadam> loui the docs are adequate
[01:48:39] <mekwall> stede: my bad, let me rephrase... it returns only one preceeding element for each element in the set :)
[01:49:06] <aaronmcadam> so inside ur each, you'd need $( this ).prev() stede
[01:49:06] <nail_> stede: there's prevUntil() if you want all of them at once
[01:49:18] <mekwall> stede: do you want $("td.foo").prev() will return every td before every td.foo
[01:49:31] <ravenzz> mekwall and isn't there a way to block the execution?
[01:49:33] <Kai`> Hi
[01:49:37] <mekwall> ravenzz: nope
[01:49:46] <ravenzz> that's bad :[
[01:49:58] <mekwall> ravenzz: not really :) it's how javascript works
[01:49:58] <nail_> or prevAll()
[01:50:24] <loui> aaronmcadam: Yes, I've tested the examples, but using (about) the same code in my web page doesn't work as expected
[01:50:48] <mekwall> nail_ +1
[01:50:49] <ravenzz> mekwall it is bad that you can't reproduce that by js
[01:51:09] <aaronmcadam> reproduce what
[01:51:15] <mekwall> ravenzz: alert and confirm are provided by the browser api, it's not something that is built into js
[01:51:36] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: reproduce the blocking behavior of alert and confirm
[01:51:39] <aaronmcadam> host and native objects baby
[01:51:49] <aaronmcadam> why would u wanna do that
[01:51:53] <ravenzz> yep ok
[01:51:58] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/zKRYG/show/
[01:52:19] <aaronmcadam> i kno that they're blocking but why does he want to
[01:52:38] <ravenzz> to replace the default alert() with its dialog
[01:52:39] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: he asked me why I didn't replace alert and confirm with my dialogs
[01:52:46] <ravenzz> his
[01:52:47] <ravenzz> *
[01:52:48] <aaronmcadam> people shouldn't be using alerts anymore anyway
[01:53:08] <ravenzz> you are wrong I have alerts on succes from an ajax call
[01:53:09] <stede> aaronmcadam, yes, it works only inside the "each" section
[01:53:17] <ravenzz> and it is boring to replace them with dialogs
[01:53:29] <mekwall> problem with alerts and confirm is just that... they block execution
[01:53:29] <ravenzz> html, css
[01:53:32] <aaronmcadam> boring? ol
[01:53:46] <Kai`> Is there any built-in functionality that would allow me to create new element and then reset all of its styles back to the defaults, preventing inheritance from existing style definitions on the page. E.g., A bookmarklet.
[01:53:56] <aaronmcadam> right so he wants to make the function wait until an action from a dialog instead
[01:53:59] <ravenzz> success, everything is ok blabla alert('congrats')
[01:54:07] <aaronmcadam> that's easy
[01:54:10] <mekwall> Kai`: nope
[01:54:12] <aaronmcadam> no, alerts suck
[01:54:47] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/zKRYG/show/ <-- that's why I made that
[01:54:58] <mekwall> you can do alert = $.xui.alert;
[01:54:59] <Kai`> mekwall: bummer; thanks
[01:55:08] <mekwall> but it might break your app :)
[01:55:50] <ravenzz> aaronmcadam yes i know that they sucks, infact i would replace them with his dialogs or something similar
[01:55:53] <aaronmcadam> not bad
[01:55:58] <mekwall> Kai`: why would you want to do that anyway?
[01:56:08] <mekwall> Kai`: seems like you are trying to work around another problem :)
[01:56:31] <mekwall> ravenzz: go ahead... already using them in production
[01:56:40] <ravenzz> k
[01:56:46] <mekwall> it's merely extending jquery ui dialog so the code is tested :)
[01:57:02] <aaronmcadam> are there tests mekwall?
[01:57:06] <mekwall> the additions I've made shouldn't affect the default behavior
[01:57:07] <aaronmcadam> for ur extension
[01:57:23] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: nope, haven't come that far yet... going to github it this weekend if I got the time
[01:57:44] <Kai`> mekwall: I was playing around with a bookmarklet idea and was wondering if I didn't have to .css() everything in my overlays. I would've been cool with defaults
[01:57:47] <aaronmcadam> you need tests if its gonna get larger acceptance
[01:57:56] <aaronmcadam> jasmine is easy
[01:58:02] <aaronmcadam> or else qunit like everythin else
[01:58:06] <Kai`> And am not using ui
[01:58:23] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: depends... jquery ui dialog have tests
[01:58:32] <aaronmcadam> yeah but what are u actually doing
[01:58:38] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to extend theirs
[01:58:59] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: yeah, added some features
[01:59:50] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: everything I added has an option for it, or uses the already existing options (without breaking anything)
[02:00:07] <mekwall> such as the extended animation support
[02:00:10] <aaronmcadam> no docs?
[02:00:21] <mekwall> no, I've only built it in jsfiddle :)
[02:00:25] <aaronmcadam> kk
[02:00:48] <aaronmcadam> i'm sure you did it properly
[02:01:04] <mekwall> I did it as a proof of concept a while ago, but decided to take it further
[02:01:18] <aaronmcadam> I'd just bind to jq ui's events instead
[02:01:39] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: doesn't work :)
[02:01:40] <aaronmcadam> but it's cool i'd just probably never use it
[02:02:01] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: that's the first approach I tried
[02:02:13] <aaronmcadam> what did u do then for beforeSend
[02:02:20] <aaronmcadam> or open i mean
[02:02:31] <mekwall> triggers before the dialog is actually opened
[02:02:39] <aaronmcadam> custom event
[02:02:44] <mekwall> and after, triggers when the animation is finished
[02:02:48] <lucian> i have a jquery widget, and i'd like to be able to pass arguments when i call it. any pointers?
[02:03:01] <aaronmcadam> is that a custom event or ui
[02:03:05] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: nah, they aren't events... just callbacks
[02:03:13] <aaronmcadam> lucian the docs are ur friend
[02:03:24] <aaronmcadam> right
[02:03:30] <aaronmcadam> I'd just use pubsub then
[02:03:49] <lucian> aaronmcadam: also, not very helpful
[02:04:04] <aaronmcadam> the docs for that widget are the best help
[02:04:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:04:29] <mekwall> lucian: what widget are you talking about?
[02:04:30] <aaronmcadam> so many people expect u to go and read the API for them jesus
[02:04:36] <aaronmcadam> he's gone
[02:04:44] <mekwall> and I'm lagging
[02:05:22] <aaronmcadam> so mekwall u gonna release that
[02:05:28] <mekwall> yep
[02:05:41] <aaronmcadam> tests and docs are what u need next then so good luck ya won't need it lol
[02:05:57] <mekwall> :)
[02:06:17] <aaronmcadam> submit it to javascript weekly when it's done!
[02:06:38] <aaronmcadam> and tell ajpiano
[02:06:44] <aaronmcadam> and kborchers
[02:07:14] <aaronmcadam> actually, the ui dialog is getting a rewrite soon
[02:07:22] <mekwall> hehe, I know
[02:07:25] <aaronmcadam> you should talk to those guys
[02:07:32] <aaronmcadam> have u already
[02:07:37] <mekwall> I'm keeping myself in the loop, don't worry hehe
[02:07:52] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:08:03] <aaronmcadam> i'm wondering what adam would say about it
[02:08:18] <aaronmcadam> surely those callbacks *should* be there already
[02:08:20] <mekwall> pretty sure he have seen it already
[02:08:42] <aaronmcadam> no comment?
[02:09:43] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: well, I am sure they based much on the extension capabilities in 1.9 on some of my ideas ;)
[02:09:52] <mekwall> on = of
[02:10:03] <aaronmcadam> ha
[02:10:20] <aaronmcadam> jump on the team then :p
[02:10:26] <mekwall> nah
[02:10:43] <aaronmcadam> did u submit any bugs
[02:11:01] <mekwall> nope. not really a fan of doing that
[02:11:33] <mekwall> I rather play around with new stuff/ideas and let others file/fix the bugs :D
[02:11:39] <aaronmcadam> ok but it's better to fix a tool a shitload of people use than making a small offshoot for urself
[02:12:06] <mekwall> well it's not an offshoot
[02:12:11] <aaronmcadam> bugs are also features
[02:12:14] <mekwall> its an extension
[02:12:41] <mekwall> and it can be integrated fairly easy into jquery ui, but I reckon they are trying to keep it as slim as possible
[02:12:51] <mekwall> what I add could be considered bloat by some people
[02:13:32] <aaronmcadam> i think at least those events
[02:13:53] <aaronmcadam> before and after should be there
[02:14:34] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: there's already an "open"
[02:14:35] <aaronmcadam> oh well all u need are test cases then u can prove it
[02:16:18] <aaronmcadam> ?eval ?fail
[02:16:18] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: syntax error
[02:16:24] <aaronmcadam> oooh
[02:19:59] <waseem_> I am trying to build a drag and drop feature in my jQuery *Mobile* application. I tried to use jQuery UI's draggable and droppable methods in my mobile device. It seems that JQUI is not supposed to work with mobile applications. I will highly appreciate if you could give me any pointer that will get me started in the right direction.
[02:20:32] <Maarten_PI> hi guys, still wanted to thank you for explaing the A in AJAX and how to write a callback function instead of trying a return...
[02:21:32] <sasori> question: let's say i have a hidden input form, and i want to select its id together with its type...how to do that in jquery given the form as e.g <input type="hidden" name="test" id="test"  value="hiddenval" />
[02:23:43] <mekwall> waseem_: jQuery Mobile is for mobile devices
[02:23:54] <mekwall> waseem_: http://jquerymobile.com/
[02:23:57] <Haprog> sasori: I'm not 100% sure but I'd guess $('input[type="hidden"][id="test"]')
[02:24:17] <seutje> please don't use [id="test"] :(
[02:24:32] <Haprog> actually.. I was just about to point that :P
[02:24:34] <seutje> attribute selectors aren't cheap
[02:24:39] <Haprog> use #test instead
[02:24:41] <waseem_> mekwall: I am using jQuery Mobile in my application. I wondered if I could use jQuery UI also in it.
[02:25:01] <sasori> what if i want type + name and not id how's that ?
[02:25:17] <mekwall> waseem_: pretty sure they aren't meant to be used together :)
[02:25:25] <seutje> sasori: I'm confused, u want to grab the ID and type of this element, but based on what would u like to identify this element as the one u want?
[02:26:06] <waseem_> mekwall: Okay. Thanks for letting me go in a wrong direction. However, can you point me somewhere that talks about implementing drag and drop in jQuery Mobile.
[02:26:10] <sasori> yeah am just asking for a different selecting technique
[02:26:33] <waseem_> mekwall: Since mobile devices are quite different from normal browsers, I have little idea how to implement it.
[02:26:34] <mekwall> waseem_: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/mobiledraganddrop
[02:26:36] <sasori> is it $('input[type="hidden"][name]]'); ?
[02:26:54] <Haprog> you should just have an id on it and use $('#my_id') in real code though
[02:26:54] <mekwall> waseem_: http://www.stevefenton.co.uk/cmsfiles/assets/File/mobiledragdrop.html
[02:26:59] <mekwall> try that in your mobile
[02:27:04] <seutje> sasori: one ] too much there
[02:27:28] <seutje> and that would grab any input type hidden that has a name attribute with *any* value
[02:28:04] <sasori> seautje what if there's a specific name for it? is it $('input[type="hidden"][name="blah"]) ?
[02:28:25] <seutje> $('input[type="hidden"][name="test"]') would be more specific
[02:28:46] <seutje> but again, attribute selectors aren't cheap, if u can, try selecting based on ID or class
[02:28:53] <sasori> ok thanks :D
[02:29:28] <seutje> and if u must use an attribute selector, cache that shit like a mofo!
[02:29:59] <sasori> ok thanks
[02:30:21] <waseem_> mekwall: I tried it but could not use it properly. Perhaps I will look into it more and come back when I face another problem.
[02:31:20] <mekwall> waseem_: I think the drag and drop on mobile devices inside the browser is pretty uncharted :)
[02:32:10] <waseem_> mekwall: Yes indeed.
[02:33:52] <waseem_> mekwall: And that plugin has many rough edges. Perhaps I will have to create my own. May be I will try to port JQUI's draggable and droppable modules to use JQM.
[02:34:18] <mekwall> that will be hard
[02:34:23] <mekwall> since they are extending the widget
[02:34:56] <phrearch> ah, i finally got the difference between foo.prototype.bar and foo.bar :)
[02:35:13] <waseem_> mekwall: So instead of mousedown, mousemove and mouse up, it will use corresponding touch events.
[02:35:15] <phrearch> got some weird results mixing em both
[02:36:05] <waseem_> mekwall: Stupid question but who are extending widget, JQUI or JQM?
[02:36:09] <mekwall> phrearch: wow, that's js basics ;)
[02:36:27] <mekwall> waseem_: all jquery ui widgets extend the base widget
[02:36:42] <mekwall> waseem_: so porting a lone widget will be tough
[02:36:50] <phrearch> mekwall: yea indeed :)
[02:37:13] <mekwall> phrearch: have you checked out http://jqfundamentals.com/ ?
[02:37:29] <phrearch> nope, thanks for the tip
[02:37:48] <waseem_> mekwall: Hmmm. That's not a good sign. I will fiddle around.
[02:37:57] <phrearch> looks like an extensive resource
[02:38:28] <mekwall> phrearch: it is, and will be the base for learn.jquery.com :)
[02:38:48] <phrearch> nice that it also covers requirejs
[02:39:18] <phrearch> i found that creating an application structure is one of the most undocumented parts in js
[02:40:12] <phrearch> really nice docs
[02:42:29] <mekwall> phrearch: its because it can be done in so many ways
[02:42:51] <mekwall> especially if you use jQuery to build it
[02:42:57] <phrearch> mekwall: i still wonder how to properly setup requirejs with jquery
[02:43:15] <mekwall> phrearch: http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[02:43:58] <phrearch> yea, ive been through that and ended up with a structure like https://github.com/phrearch/hwios/blob/master/services/web_ui/media/scripts/modules/hyki.js
[02:44:57] <phrearch> somehow it doesnt optimize right though
[02:46:06] <phrearch> each module has a list of dependencies, but those dependencies get concatted in each module
[02:47:04] <phrearch> anyway, i should read up more, though i didnt find requirejs docs very clear on that
[02:47:34] <azazul> hi
[02:49:05] <azazul> for some reason  $.getJSON()  is not sending the request to the server , what could be the issue >
[02:49:21] <azazul> this is how i execute it :  $.getJSON('/index.php/list/' + query , target.populate );
[02:49:48] <stede> it is possible to select 2nd child instead of :first?
[02:49:59] <stede> child[1] maybe?
[02:50:11] <azazul> where target.populate is a method with single argument ( but it doesnt get even to it )
[02:51:29] <azazul> stede container[0].childNodes[2] would do it
[02:51:37] <azazul> ( maybe )
[02:51:49] <rodr1go> good morning all, How can I get a global variable inside a function?
[02:51:51] <phrearch> azazul: check the console?
[02:52:03] <phrearch> probably should show a 404
[02:52:18] <azazul> oh ... damn .. forgot , phrearch , it happens only on E7
[02:52:39] <azazul> that was the important bit ::heanddesk::
[02:53:02] <stede> azazul, i used :nth-child(2) now
[02:53:04] <phrearch> maybe it doesnt accept a relative uri starting with /
[02:53:21] <azazul> URL is absolute
[02:53:35] <phrearch> try adding the ip/dns in front?
[02:53:41] <azazul> k
[02:54:46] <azazul> nope , no effect
[02:55:54] <azazul> so , any other ideas why IE7 would send no requests with $>getJSON() ?
[02:56:12] <azazul> i mean : $.getJSON()
[02:58:03] <jomofcw> Please, how could I easily check if a .data('x') is already set or not ?
[02:58:41] <Xotix> hi
[03:00:26] <Xotix> can i somehow make a "remote controle" for somethign which is sortable with jquery ui sortable()? e.g. i make a table sortable, but i want a symbol next on each row to sort it, which is not html-technically in the table.
[03:05:28] <seutje> jomofcw: check for undefined?
[03:07:36] <azazul> stede: i would recommend to use css3 selectors only as last resort , they are definitely the slowest way
[03:09:14] <seutje> Xotix: I usually add a <a class="tabledrag-handle"> to the first cell of sortable rows
[03:09:30] <seutje> and set that as the handle
[03:10:02] <seutje> so I can have my rows contain elements with interaction without making it a pain in the ass :)
[03:10:32] <Xotix> handle? ah, i'll check that out, you mean like $( ".selector" ).sortable({ handle: 'h2' });?
[03:10:48] <Xotix> haven't seen i.
[03:12:25] <johnline3> is it possible have jquery fadeIn/Out {background:url()}'s ?
[03:12:59] <Xotix> thanks
[03:13:04] <seutje> Xotix: like $('.selector').find('tr td:first-child').prepend('<a href="#" class="tabledrag-handle">drag me</a>').end().sortable({ handle: '.tabledrag-handle' }); or something
[03:13:29] <Xotix> okay thanks i'll play a bit around with that
[03:18:11] <_fil_> hello people!  I'd like to halt all animations when the window is not the front window; do you know how could I test this?
[03:18:48] <gorhgorh> hi there
[03:19:06] <gorhgorh> i got a silly question, but i can't find the answer :)
[03:19:08] <Hooloovoo> _fil_: maybe requestAnimationFrame does that.
[03:19:53] <gorhgorh> i need to make a loop that swap 2 text i made a func with a delay : $(".swapText").delay(2000).fadeToggle();
[03:20:14] <gorhgorh> how can i make it "loop" so the text swap eack let's say, 2 sec
[03:20:41] <_fil_> thx Hooloovoo that's it!
[03:21:12] <Hooloovoo> _fil_: you're welcome =)'
[03:21:59] <jomofcw> seutje hi ! OK that's what I do so ^^.
[03:22:54] <jomofcw> Is there a way to set multiple attribute using just one method ? Currently I do many .attr(name,value) chained together...
[03:22:59] <flint0131> Who uses Google+ ??
[03:23:03] <flint0131> :|
[03:24:26] <Phunky> jomofcw just pass an object containing them all to a single attr
[03:24:57] <Phunky> $('#id').attr({src:'1', title:'2', style:'3'});
[03:27:48] <_fil_> flint0131: can't, they punished me for not using my so-called "real name"
[03:28:30] <flint0131> _fil_: wait, How can I do that <buzz> thing?
[03:29:00] <_fil_> just type someone's nick, flint0131
[03:29:03] <jomofcw> Phunky thnaks just don't understand why it isn't in the API doc :/
[03:29:31] <flint0131> _fil_: So this, <buzz>'s your PC too? Cool.
[03:30:36] <flint0131> Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone here is playing with Google+ API.
[03:31:05] <_fil_> yep it does
[03:31:10] <_fil_> (bye)
[03:31:33] <azazul> jquery hates me and i hate it back
[03:31:53] <azazul> still cannot make my $.getJSON() work
[03:32:08] <flint0131> Why? What's wrong? :|
[03:32:23] <azazul> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7443098/jquery-getjson-doesnt-work-on-ie7
[03:33:21] <azazul> i am kinda lost
[03:33:39] <azazul> and have wasted more then an hour on it
[03:34:24] <gorhgorh> anyone know how i could loop a function ?  i want 2 text to swap each 2 sec
[03:35:31] <ahmet> hi!
[03:35:41] <Phunky> jomofcw it's the 2nd example on http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[03:36:09] <ahmet> $("a").attr("href");
[03:36:19] <ahmet> result : goPage.html
[03:36:22] <nail_> gorhgorh: function foo() { /* do stuff */ setTimeout(foo, 2000); }()
[03:36:36] <gorhgorh> thanks nail
[03:36:51] <ahmet> :)
[03:37:29] <jomofcw> keyUp is the best event to capture typing, right ?
[03:38:03] <ahmet> javascript:alert("asasas");
[03:38:03] <ahmet> javascript:alert("asasas");
[03:38:03] <ahmet> javascript:alert("asasas");
[03:44:40] <acalbaza> in my plugin, im using the prescribed method on the jquery plugin auth page... if i want access to the element's .data() in a private function, am i forced to pass the element reference down to EACH private function?
[03:47:05] <nail_> gorhgorh: depending on your use it's probably better to wrap the function in ().. (function() {..})()
[03:47:36] <gorhgorh> @nail, i just need a simple swap infact
[03:48:07] <nail_> yeah, whatever you want it to do is up to you, I was just speaking syntax wise :)
[03:48:11] <gorhgorh> i got 2 div that need to alternate, using this toggle : $(".swapText").delay(2000).fadeToggle();
[03:48:21] <gorhgorh> hÃ© hÃ© )
[03:49:09] <gorhgorh> i'm sadly not far enough into JS to think syntax wise, actually i just need it to work )
[03:50:23] <acalbaza> grrr... why is $(this).data('foo') out of scope when i call a private method from a public one?!
[03:50:41] <azazul> ok , one more call for help on my $.getJSON problem
[03:50:42] <azazul> http://laptop.azazul.operaunite.com/localhost/
[03:51:04] <azazul> first field "pilsÄ“ta"  has an autocomplete
[03:51:13] <azazul> this does not work in IE7
[03:51:59] <azazul> in line 180 of the http://laptop.azazul.operaunite.com/localhost/javascript/behavior.js file is  $.getJSON('/index.php/list/' + query , target.populate );
[03:52:44] <azazul> it does not make a request , if i an alert(1) there , it will show up in IE7
[03:53:00] <azazul> i think that about covers all i know
[04:02:43] <maene> just wondering, how can I remove a single paragraph (html) based on what the text is
[04:03:07] <maene> I have a few lines in specific lines that I'd like to "filter" out by just removing that whole paragraph
[04:03:12] <ravenzz> ?contains @ maene
[04:03:13] <bot-t> maene, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[04:03:28] <maene> ravenzz: does it allow regexes?
[04:03:35] <ravenzz> I don't think so
[04:03:52] <topriddy> hello. how do you guys handle multiple jquery versions in a page? i cant change the older version which would break somethngs in an environment i have no control over.
[04:04:17] <topriddy> ...my other question is best way to achieve tr click and also ommouseover roll over effect
[04:04:31] <NoNoNo> http://badassjs.com/post/2929065287/obfuscation
[04:04:41] <NoNoNo> sorry wrong channel
[04:09:36] <maene> ravenzz: I get this error: Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: "(Source: ")
[04:09:46] <ravenzz> ?demo @ maene
[04:09:46] <bot-t> maene, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:12:22] <maene> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/
[04:13:17] <ispirto> hello, neither $('.steps').attr('style', 'background:url(http://www.achdp.com/form/images/step' + nextformid + '.png'); nor $('.steps').css('background', 'url(http://www.achdp.com/form/images/step' + nextformid + '.png'); working on chrome. any reason why?
[04:16:57] <maene> ravenzz: forgot to apply jquery there, but you get the idea
[04:21:37] <ravenzz> maene the problem belong to the round parenthesis
[04:21:54] <ravenzz> maene http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/1/
[04:22:12] <_phoe6>  var input = $('input', row);
[04:22:23] <_phoe6> what kind of statement is above?
[04:23:10] <maene> ravenzz: I kinda need it to be that specific
[04:23:28] <flint0131> fckn ISP
[04:23:32] <ravenzz> then you need to use regex
[04:24:55] <maene> ravenzz: yeah, but :contains() doesnt allow regexes, does it?
[04:25:46] <ravenzz> maene http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/2/
[04:26:04] <maene> thanks
[04:26:29] <ravenzz> feel free to replace text() with html() if you don't need to strip tags
[04:28:35] <maene> maene: yeah I just did, that way I can include the anchor tag
[04:28:44] <maene> ravenzz: ^
[04:30:57] <topriddy> Is there any restriction to using the $ prefix instead of jQuery in codes?
[04:32:07] <ravenzz> conflicts with other libraries
[04:32:14] <TheCode> Hey champs, what's the most elegant way to remove the last char of a string?
[04:32:26] <ravenzz> substr ?
[04:32:37] <TheCode> it aks for two params
[04:32:39] <ravenzz> sorry substring()
[04:32:42] <TheCode> that too
[04:32:51] <Industrial> So do you know what the params are?
[04:32:53] <TheCode> the second param requires to use .length
[04:32:55] <ravenzz> sustr is the php one
[04:32:57] <TheCode> I do
[04:32:57] <Industrial> or are supposed to be?
[04:33:14] <Industrial> does it work?
[04:33:38] <TheCode> 'Apples'.substr(-1), would have been excellent.
[04:33:51] <TheCode> It works that way in Python
[04:34:05] <TheCode> Negative index
[04:36:58] <ravenzz> ?eval "foo!".replace(/.$/,'')
[04:36:59] <bot-t> ravenzz: "foo"
[04:42:05] <projmon> hello good sirs
[04:42:51] <projmon> can i somehow reregister a ajaxForm success callback ?
[04:42:55] <Whirl3d> Good Morning. How do you check for changes in the value of an input text field as the data is entered? .change() only works on .blur
[04:44:39] <projmon> Whirl3d, keydown perhaps
[04:45:43] <bryricker> Can anybody see why I'm getting "undefined" here? http://jsfiddle.net/yCJgy/
[04:47:08] <Whirl3d> projmon, you can register multiple success callbacks, so perhaps you can use some other logic to determine which one to use, but register several.
[04:47:25] <projmon> Whirl3d, im thinking along those lines too
[04:48:00] <Whirl3d> Other than that I would check into bind because I believe the success callback can be bound and unbound...but not 100% sure of that
[04:48:13] <projmon> what about registering a dummy ajax call. ie another ajaxForm with a dummy address, and then have my code in the error callback?
[04:48:33] <projmon> because basically i just want to run code when the first success callback has finished running
[04:48:47] <projmon> will that work?
[04:49:04] <Whirl3d> what are you tryingto do exactly?
[04:49:16] <jomofcw> keyUp is the best event to capture typing, right ?
[04:49:35] <Hooloovoo> right
[04:50:07] <projmon> :)
[04:51:11] <Whirl3d> projmon, if you want to run a script at the end of your callback, just put it at the end of your callback.
[04:51:16] <projmon> Whirl3d, i have a wordpress plugin (contact form 7) which handles a form pretty nicely with ajax submission and validation messages and stuff. i want to modify the validation messages but i need to do so after cf7 have finished its code
[04:51:36] <maene> ravenzz: playing around with it now, but I have run into an issue. The following doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/3/
[04:51:45] <maene> ravenzz: do I have to do two seperate filters?
[04:51:49] <projmon> Whirl3d, i want to do this without messing with the source code of the plugin
[04:52:08] <projmon> so from another js-file
[04:52:09] <Whirl3d> projmon, is there an event callback builtin to the plugin? Should be if there isn't.
[04:52:53] <projmon> it uses ajaxForm({success: foo() {Â /* does stuff */ }})
[04:53:18] <Whirl3d> but what is the "does stuff"? is there any event in the callback that you can listen for?
[04:54:09] <projmon> it has validation logic and things like that
[04:54:16] <Whirl3d> In the callback, if it generates a message in a div, you could listen for the ajaxComplete event and then setup a loop to check the dom for the message div it creates.
[04:54:23] <projmon> also it creates messages like "this field is required"
[04:55:44] <projmon> Whirl3d, i dont want to edit the callback though. can this be done from another js-file?
[04:56:31] <Whirl3d> You wouldn't edit the callback. You would (in a second file) listen for the ajax complete event (I need to look up the syntax) and create another separate callback.
[04:57:00] <Whirl3d> in the second callback, you'd loop until a div was added to the dom and then call your function.
[04:57:18] <Whirl3d> So when it pops up the validation message, you come out of your loop and do your business
[04:57:22] <Whirl3d> maybe?
[04:57:25] <projmon> i c
[04:58:05] <Whirl3d> So the second ajax success callback would trigger a listener for some event (in this case the adding of a div with a message in it)
[04:58:07] <projmon> not sure about the looping though ^_^
[04:58:24] <projmon> is a loop really needed?
[04:58:48] <projmon> if the ajax is completed, and its the right ajax call. shouldnt a single check suffice?
[04:59:31] <Whirl3d> It's hard to say...you wanted something to be done after the callback was completed, right?
[04:59:39] <projmon> yup
[04:59:49] <Whirl3d> so, a second callback would fire at the same time.
[05:00:07] <Whirl3d> you need to listen for the end of the first callback. Using a second callback to trigger the listener
[05:00:35] <Whirl3d> so that way your listener isnt just running amuck if the ajax doesn't complete correclty
[05:02:55] <projmon> Whirl3d, i c. hopefully its treating it as "complete" when the success callback has finished and not before.. will try

[05:13:10] <Ankabout> hi, I just want to ask something to confirm what I think... these lightbox scripts for photos that are out there
[05:13:32] <Ankabout> they are nothing more than some JS activating and de-activating a fullscreen element that overlays the whole page right?
[05:13:52] <pachet_> thats the basic concept
[05:14:44] <Ankabout> alright, then I can just manually code what I need. makes a lot more sense for me than loading a script and editing it to my liking
[05:14:53] <pachet_> theres some work to do if you're using them as a gallery, in terms of calculating the wrapper size for the next image after load
[05:15:00] <pachet_> yeah, nothing too complicated
[05:15:25] <Ankabout> nah the gallery part is being done with another script from the CMS
[05:15:25] <ravenzz> maene 2 solutions: http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/5/ http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/4/
[05:24:16] <walid> hi guys! i have a site with a big background image, and i want the page to wait for the image to load before it displays it
[05:25:16] <walid> i looked into several different options, but most are solutions to an image-change-on-hover situation..
[05:25:25] <walid> my case is slightly different
[05:25:28] <walid> example:
[05:25:33] <walid> www.vbbros.net/d6
[05:27:14] <coldhead> GO MUSTANGS
[05:29:36] <walid> can anyone give a hand?
[05:30:02] <coldhead>    i am doing you a demo, walid
[05:30:33] <walid> coldhead: you're awesome
[05:30:34] <walid> :)
[05:32:44] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/NgnRf/
[05:32:48] <coldhead> does that make sense to you?
[05:34:09] <walid> coldhead: hm i still see the image loading, which is what i don't want..
[05:34:34] <walid> i mean i want it to display at once, you know what i mean?
[05:34:44] <coldhead> that's what my code was supposed to do
[05:34:51] <coldhead> show nothing until the image was loaded
[05:35:00] <walid> hm.
[05:35:04] <coldhead> at which point it sets the "loaded" class on <body>
[05:35:12] <coldhead> and makes it visible
[05:35:35] <juha_> i'm just farting here
[05:35:40] <walid> coldhead: hm.. cause here i see it loading
[05:35:41] <juha_> nothing to see (or smell) here
[05:35:53] <juha_> stings the nostrils
[05:36:03] <ravenzz> walid he didn't include jQuery
[05:36:06] <ravenzz> but it is working
[05:36:09] <walid> (as in: it's not displayed as 1 block
[05:36:15] <walid> ravenzz: haha let me check
[05:37:04] <ravenzz> I have to go
[05:37:23] <walid> coldhead: i now included jquery, but it's still not working
[05:37:34] <walid> (i obv empty cache between tries :P )
[05:38:06] <coldhead> guh i'm such an idiot
[05:40:00] <pachet_> moofools
[05:44:27] <sodapop> hi, im having trouble selecting a <select> by name is this correct $('input[name=test]') ?
[05:45:07] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/NgnRf/12/
[05:45:11] <coldhead> that works for me now
[05:45:28] <coldhead> needed jQuery and needed to use domReady not domLoad
[05:45:33] <coldhead> because load is too late
[05:45:50] <coldhead> i am so sorry i wasted your time
[05:46:16] <coldhead> sodapop: you might need to use "quotes"
[05:46:26] <coldhead> $('input[name="test"]')
[05:47:32] <walid> coldhead: nicce
[05:47:42] <walid> i'll study and implement this right now.
[05:47:54] <walid> this, however, will load the whole body  when ready
[05:48:06] <walid> is it possible to fade only the background img only?
[05:48:24] <coldhead> not realllly
[05:48:52] <coldhead> you have to fake it with a div that fills the entire background
[05:48:57] <seutje> only if u make a div, slide it underneith and put the background img on that
[05:48:57] <coldhead> and fade THAT in
[05:49:21] <pheredhel> fading the bgimage would make little sense anyway, what should show behind the background?
[05:49:31] <seutje> whiteness!
[05:49:47] <seutje> it's to give those designers a scare and show em some whitespace
[05:50:19] <pheredhel> why white? why not black or green ? white is just the default background color... so... fading the background makes little sense I think
[05:50:46] <seutje> make em go all "omg, I forgot to fill some whitespace, lemme design some functionality that was never in the technical spec!!"
[05:51:25] <seutje> pheredhel: wouldn't be the first site I see that fades in in its entirety
[05:51:46] <seutje> I especially love it when it's done on every pageload, and preferably like 5 secs long
[05:52:09] <pheredhel> seutje: correct, I was talking about it from a technical pov : what would happen if you fade in the background of a website (i.e. body contents)
[05:52:09] <foofoobar> Hi
[05:52:39] <pachet_> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/SeKUS/1/
[05:52:43] <foofoobar> $('form').submit(..) works, but accessing via the id selector $('#myid').submit(..) does not, what can be the cause for this?
[05:52:49] <pachet_> modified coldhead's towards what he was talking about
[05:53:10] <pachet_> theres some bloat in it, but
[05:53:46] <seutje> pheredhel: I assume that's why he wants to fade only the image
[05:54:04] <seutje> foofoobar: the id is wrong?
[05:54:10] <pheredhel> true, was just talking about why this is not possible
[05:54:14] <foofoobar> seutje: no, I triple checked it..
[05:54:36] <pheredhel> foofoobar: can you paste somewhere?
[05:54:41] <seutje> foofoobar: there's something in the page with an identical ID and it precedes this form?
[05:55:03] <seutje> try $('[id="myid"]').length
[05:55:07] <foofoobar> no identical ID
[05:55:11] <foofoobar> source: http://nopaste.me/paste/11355629014e73471e88065
[05:55:25] <foofoobar> this does not work. if I change "#addSubscription" to "form" it works
[05:56:43] <pachet_> also in that fiddle i posted, fadeIn() did nothing but animate({opacity:1}) worked fine
[05:56:44] <walid> rb
[05:56:45] <pachet_> why is that ;/
[05:56:46] <walid> brb
[05:57:10] <seutje> foofoobar: http://jsfiddle.net/EW4Xv/ works fine for me
[05:58:13] <foofoobar> seutje: mhh. works here, too. so now I'm total confused
[05:59:58] <sodapop> it was select[name not input :/
[06:02:03] <OnkelTem> If an element is hidden, how would I know its height?
[06:02:14] <OnkelTem> is there any way to do this?
[06:02:27] <pachet_> cant calculate height on a hidden element
[06:02:37] <walid> sry guys got distracted
[06:02:38] <walid> but back
[06:02:43] <walid> vbbros.net/d6
[06:02:56] <walid> is why i need to load the background only
[06:03:03] <walid> rest is already here
[06:03:04] <pheredhel> sure pachet_ ?  I thought it's only for display:none that you can't do that?
[06:03:21] <pachet_> isnt that what "hidden" means?
[06:03:27] <pachet_> from the dom's perspective?
[06:03:52] <OnkelTem> weird. I have drop-down (superfish) menu, and I need to calculate heights of all the elements
[06:04:04] <pheredhel> display:hidden was "don't show but still uses space" if I remember correctly
[06:04:25] <OnkelTem> pheredhel: no, this is for visibility stand
[06:04:46] <seutje> there's a display: hidden? o.O
[06:04:49] <pachet_> that's visibility: hidden
[06:04:56] <pheredhel> oh true
[06:06:18] <pachet_> OnkelTem: you'll have to copy the elements to a rendered buffer outside the visible page, calculate the heights of those proxy elements, then do your calculations from there
[06:06:19] <pheredhel> I think display:hidden was nonstandard
[06:09:11] <seutje> $.fn.realHeight = function() { this.css({'position':'absolute','display':'block','visibility':'hidden'}); var h = this.height(); this.removeAttr('style'); return h; }
[06:09:18] <seutje> it asplodes inline styles though :P
[06:09:32] <seutje> should prolly capture original values and reset those after capturing the height
[06:09:43] <seutje> or only those that were set as inline styles
[06:09:44] <jomofcw> I'm trying to get each LI first parents of a set of element. I try doing "$elements.parents('li:first')" but it only return me the first li parent of the first element of the set of element.
[06:10:17] <jomofcw> Perhaps I should use a each...
[06:11:38] <seutje> ?closest @ jomofcw
[06:11:38] <bot-t> jomofcw, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:11:42] <jomofcw> OK, I should use closest instead of that
[06:11:43] <jomofcw> ^^
[06:11:45] <jomofcw> seutje :D
[06:11:56] <seutje> ^^
[06:14:52] <OnkelTem> Is there an even when I show an Element?
[06:14:58] <OnkelTem> event
[06:15:18] <OnkelTem> When I do $('ul').show();
[06:15:37] <imsky> maybe
[06:15:45] <nail_> you can trigger one in the callback
[06:16:05] <coldhead> you could make your own custom version of show that triggers a custom "myshow" event and then does that actual show
[06:16:34] <OnkelTem> I can't I think... I use superfish menu. I need to recalculate heights when submenus appear
[06:16:52] <coldhead> how many more lives must superfish ruin
[06:16:56] <pachet_> rewriting plugins is lose
[06:16:58] <pachet_> ^
[06:17:41] <OnkelTem> pachet_: rewriting? I add my own function after SF build menu
[06:17:48] <seutje> OnkelTem: oh look! https://github.com/dreamerslab/jquery.actual
[06:17:49] <OnkelTem> not touching sf source
[06:18:26] <seutje> don't the menu's appear when their parent is hovered?
[06:18:31] <OnkelTem> seutje: iteresting!
[06:18:48] <OnkelTem> seutje: exactly. You mean bind hover?
[06:18:52] <OnkelTem> over parent
[06:18:57] <seutje> suppose
[06:19:16] <OnkelTem> seutje: I afraid LIs has no heights, really. Until they are fully rendered
[06:19:17] <seutje> superfish doesn't contain any JS besides the sfHover class toggler, no?
[06:19:43] <OnkelTem> seutje: its code is too hard for me read :(
[06:19:47] <seutje> OnkelTem: u lost me... nothing has a height until it's rendered
[06:20:00] <seutje> and how can something not be "fully" rendered?
[06:20:10] <OnkelTem> ok, just rendered )
[06:20:14] <OnkelTem> w/o fully )
[06:20:50] <imsky> da...da
[06:21:56] <OnkelTem> seutje: have no idea now how that jquery.actualy works.
[06:22:25] <OnkelTem> if an element is yet to be shown, who knows its height? o_O
[06:22:36] <foofoobar> seutje: solved it, the problem was that the source was implemented in a fancybox-div so the selector could not access it..
[06:22:42] <coldhead> god
[06:22:45] <imsky> hmm you can give it opacity:0 and pre-render it?
[06:22:48] <seutje> lolol
[06:22:53] <foofoobar> Another question: is it possible to send a POST-ajax request to another url?
[06:23:00] <foofoobar> *another domain
[06:23:24] <seutje> OnkelTem: jquery.actual just shows it (sorta), grabs its height (or whatever u wanted), hides it and returns the value
[06:24:00] <seutje> OnkelTem: the "usage" bit on the project page should hint towards how to use it...
[06:24:21] <pachet_> foobar: not really
[06:24:26] <pachet_> there are ways to cheat it
[06:24:46] <pheredhel> pachet_: why should an xmlhttp request not go to another domain?
[06:25:06] <imsky> same origin policy bro
[06:25:29] <pheredhel> oh, forgot that it is a bit more problematic on the xmlhttprequest
[06:25:54] <foofoobar> So it's not possible?
[06:26:05] <foofoobar> I just want to send something like a subscription to another page from me
[06:26:12] <pachet_> er
[06:26:16] <pachet_> want to configure a proxy?
[06:26:21] <pachet_> ;o
[06:26:34] <foofoobar> do I have to do sth. like "<img src=http://myserver.com/addSubscription/address /> ?
[06:26:42] <imsky> wat
[06:27:00] <pheredhel> foofoobar: that would work. not nice though... you can use an iframe aswell
[06:27:06] <foofoobar> mhhh
[06:27:13] <foofoobar> complicated
[06:27:59] <seutje> foofoobar: do u need to parse the response on the same page?
[06:28:08] <foofoobar> not really
[06:28:18] <foofoobar> to submit the email would be enough
[06:28:33] <seutje> ?g crossdomain ajax post iframe technique

[06:30:12] <sphinxxx> with the jquery ui autocomplete plugin, how can i show certain values on the dropdown, but on selection, actually insert a different value (which is mapped to the one they selected)
[06:31:09] <Paveloosha> Hi guys. Is it posible to get control over a div which was loaded into a Iframe?
[06:31:44] <tbranyen> $("iframe").contents().find("div").css("key", "val")
[06:32:00] <foofoobar> $('body').append('<img height=1 width=1 src="http://mysever.com/getMail/?' + email); will be the simplest I think

[06:32:48] <pachet_> spammer's dream
[06:33:09] <foofoobar> pachet_: you mean me?
[06:37:32] <quicksilver> tbranyen: only works if the iframe comes from the same domain as the root page, right?
[06:38:36] <CannedCorn> hey guys, the best way to get autocomplete is through using the jquery-ui plugin right?
[06:38:44] <pachet_> foofoobar: was mostly joking, im assuming they check the query string at least a little bit...
[06:38:45] <CannedCorn> err the jquery-ui feature
[06:39:17] <pachet_> best way is to write one yourself!
[06:39:33] <foofoobar> pachet_: I don't know what you are talking about.. :D
[06:40:25] <CannedCorn> pachet_ ok well i'm having trouble using it
[06:40:31] <CannedCorn> was wondering if I could get some help
[06:41:35] <pachet_> sure what's up
[06:41:53] <sphinxxx> actually i need help with it too
[06:42:52] <sphinxxx> where is the autocomplete example using JSON?
[06:42:55] <sphinxxx> not jsonp
[06:42:58] <CannedCorn> yeah!
[06:43:00] <CannedCorn> exactly
[06:43:40] <pachet_> what example?
[06:43:42] <m8> Hi, i can filter element of an html ajax response?
[06:43:42] <pachet_> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete?
[06:44:15] <m8> in my code alert is empty :( http://pastie.org/private/kgyubmhq3bzz0caqhma
[06:45:11] <anger> Hi!
[06:45:24] <CannedCorn> I'm getting errors running this pachet_ https://gist.github.com/1222154
[06:45:43] <CannedCorn> when i start typing i get request denied
[06:45:49] <CannedCorn> oh, maybe it's google doing that
[06:46:00] <anger> About .tabs(), is it possible to update the url with so that back-button works?
[06:46:55] <anger> Found this with google http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/jquery-ui-tabs/fixed.html but on bigger pages it scrolls the page when you click the tabs
[06:51:31] <pachet_> CannedCorn: yeah i dont think thats allowed
[06:51:47] <CannedCorn> it is, just was missing some params
[06:52:04] <CannedCorn> now it's working, got back json objects to pass to the autocomplete
[06:52:13] <CannedCorn> but i need to turn them into a list right
[06:52:28] <CannedCorn> so how do i iterate over the place json objects and pull out the names into a list?
[06:58:29] <mike817> has delegate() replaced live()?
[06:58:37] <m8> Hi, i can filter element of an html ajax response?
[07:00:14] <CannedCorn> pachet_ I'm getting the null origin error

[07:01:28] <rapha> Hi all!
[07:02:12] <rapha> What would be the best way to add one week to a date with jQuery?
[07:02:30] <rapha> (i.e. is there something pre-made or would I have to write my own algorithm?)
[07:03:44] <jkies00> hi all, i have a quick selector question.  how can i get a specific li?     $('#listName li').get(2).fadeOut();
[07:04:00] <jkies00> http://jsfiddle.net/S2kTk/
[07:04:12] <jkies00> i am totally blanking on this
[07:05:52] <Paul_Linney> $('#listName li').eq(2).fadeOut(); (http://api.jquery.com/eq/)
[07:06:44] <jkies00> thanks Paul_Linney
[07:07:34] <acalbaza> trying to create a plugin using the recommended auth approach... but how do reference a element's data() in a private method?  it feels like i have to pass the element ref around... from publicMeth{  _privateMeth($(this)); }
[07:07:38] <acalbaza> is that true?
[07:08:58] <pandeiro> is there something jquery can do to help consolidate all an element/child-element's click events to one event?
[07:12:16] <kborchers> pandeiro: you can just do $(element).children().andSelf().click(function(){...}); or even easier if you don't care if the children's default click events fire, you can just bind click to element and the child events will bubble up causing the handler for element to fire
[07:12:47] <pandeiro> kborchers: right, the problem is i don't want the event to fire multiple times
[07:13:43] <pandeiro> http://jsfiddle.net/rFun8/
[07:14:40] <kborchers> pandeiro: ok so if you do the second suggestion, it will only fire once when the event reaches the top element. if you do the first suggestion, see ?stopPropagation
[07:14:40] <bot-t> pandeiro, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:14:55] <kborchers> in your fiddle, you have two events firing, not the same one firing twice
[07:16:10] <pandeiro> i see, i was complicating things by creating a change event instead of just binding to click
[07:17:35] <pachet_> CannedCorn: sorry for late response, was on the phone
[07:17:57] <pachet_> i think you can do something like: response( $.map( data.predictions, function( item ){return {label: item.name,value: item.name}}));
[07:18:30] <pachet_> in your success callback
[07:18:42] <CannedCorn> ok
[07:18:52] <pachet_> where name is the property of the prediction you're iterating over that you want to use as the li label
[07:19:04] <CannedCorn> so it's coming back but i keep getting resource interpreted as script but transferred as json
[07:19:08] <CannedCorn> it's cause i'm using jsonp
[07:19:33] <CannedCorn> i shouldn't be, but if I use json then it gives me the cross domain error
[07:19:56] <CannedCorn> Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[07:21:07] <pachet_> er, try specifying crossDomain:true in your ajax parameters
[07:21:35] <CannedCorn> got that
[07:22:10] <CannedCorn> http://pastie.org/2543150
[07:30:01] <m8> nothing?
[07:33:36] <m8> how i can get the body element?
[07:35:47] <Elephant> m8: $("body")?
[07:36:01] <m8> yes Elephant,, i've problem with ajax request
[07:37:26] <detain1> why is the topic 1.6.3 still ? i know the people in here are way more aware of things like 1.6.4 than I am  so figure you guys wait for something before posting new versions ? is it like when its CDN mirrored or does it need to be a more meaningful release?
[07:37:34] <jomofcw> I can't understand the meaning of "in" in "isInputSupported = 'placeholder' in document.createElement('input')" ... anyone could explain it to me please ?
[07:37:53] <Elephant> m8: what about it?
[07:38:15] <m8> "HTML string cannot contain elements that are invalid within a div, such as html, head, body, or title elements."
[07:38:22] <m8> i'm From the Doc: (http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#htmlownerDocument)
[07:38:25] <m8> i'm readin here :)
[07:40:22] <Elephant> So, why are you trying to ajax a request that returns something with <body> in it?
[07:45:28] <seutje> jomofcw: it check for the presence of the property
[07:45:32] <seutje> checks*
[07:45:51] <m1chael> $.post("/check/username/", { username: username },
[07:45:54] <m1chael> is that bad syntax?
[07:46:06] <seutje> ?js foo in {'foo':null,'bar':null}
[07:46:06] <bot-t> seutje: ReferenceError: foo is not defined
[07:46:13] <seutje> ?js 'foo' in {'foo':null,'bar':null}
[07:46:14] <bot-t> seutje: true
[07:46:44] <seutje> m1chael: missing a squigly brace?
[07:46:53] <seutje> eeer, paren
[07:47:32] <m1chael> this is the full code
[07:47:33] <m1chael> http://dpaste.com/615994/
[07:48:36] <seutje> m1chael: doesn't throw a syntax error for me
[07:49:06] <m1chael> im trying to figure out why this isnt working
[07:49:13] <m1chael> http://www.lmwblog.com
[07:49:19] <m1chael> it gets stuck at "checking"
[07:50:33] <seutje> m1chael: POST http://www.lmwblog.com/check/username/ 404 (Not Found)
[07:51:09] <seutje> no error handler...
[07:52:33] <jankidudel> Simple question .. how the hell image  http://www.ajax-zoom.com/   this works ? I don't know how to send info to the server about the dimensions/positions of the selected part of an image ?
[07:53:09] <m1chael> thanks seutje: i fixed the url. but its still stuck ;/
[07:54:43] <m1chael> maybe it's a django/csrf issue
[07:56:12] <pandeiro> kborchers: mind looking at this http://jsfiddle.net/rFun8/1/ -- how would I get the checkbox to behave as expected?
[07:58:30] <kborchers> pandeiro: honestly ... without jQuery http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/rFun8/2/
[07:58:55] <seutje> m1chael: POST http://www.lmwblog.com/check/username/ 403 (Forbidden)
[08:00:14] <seutje> kborchers: lolol
[08:01:05] <Aamir> is there any way we can move the current month to the right (as 3rd) and show previous 2 months on left: http://gyazo.com/d9a689a7f16caf42fba64cabeab6baf3
[08:01:57] <jomofcw> Thanks seutje :)
[08:02:35] <pandeiro> kborchers: back to square one if i need to attach an event handler then? that doesnt work but thanks
[08:03:01] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/GZ6wt/
[08:03:25] <kborchers> pandeiro: sure it does. you can still use that method to handle your checking/unchecking but then attach a handler to the change event of the checkboxes to do other stuff and you're good to go
[08:03:51] <pandeiro> ah so the handler goes to the change of the checkbox instead of the li click, gotcha
[08:05:10] <kborchers> pandeiro: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/rFun8/4/
[08:12:53] <projmon> btw Whirl3d your idea worked :)

[08:27:40] <caesargus_> hi hi
[08:28:08] <caesargus_> I'm having an issue where .html() is not updating the display of the page
[08:28:20] <caesargus_> but the contents are updated (according to the alerts that I have placed)
[08:28:34] <jankidudel> caesargus, probably I could help you
[08:28:52] <pachet_> CannedCorn: once again, i know this was ten years ago, but i see here that google places doesnt support jsonp
[08:29:29] <jankidudel> caesargus_, pastebin your code
[08:29:33] <caesargus_> k
[08:33:24] <caesargus_> jankidudel: http://pastebin.com/GwpSiwt6
[08:33:54] <caesargus_> oh nevermind :p
[08:34:00] <caesargus_> there are multiple instances of the id
[08:35:24] <caesargus_> sweet thanks for listening to me :)
[08:35:33] <caesargus_> I broke the build!
[08:37:50] <chemical23> Having a strange problem on a wordpress site - http://www.txproit.com/wordpress/. The meteor slider and news-ticker (both relying on jquery for transitions) stops working after opening up a new tab and visiting for example www.google.com  and returning to the website's tab in Firefox 6.0.2 and Chrome 13.0.782.220m. Anyone has any ideas what is happening here?
[08:40:08] <simonmellor> hi guys, how can i find out what focus when to when a blur event is triggered?
[08:40:40] <Elephant> alert()?
[08:40:48] <Elephant> console.log()?
[08:41:19] <caesargus_> what focus?
[08:41:25] <caesargus_> you mean what is focused next?
[08:41:35] <maene> Why isnt the following working? http://jsfiddle.net/YsJDT/3/
[08:41:35] <simonmellor> as in what selector has focus after the blur
[08:41:41] <maene> Do I have to run two filters?
[08:41:45] <simonmellor> is there anything in the eventdata?
[08:42:00] <caesargus_> how are you moving off the field simon?
[08:42:06] <caesargus_> are you tabbing or something else?
[08:42:17] <simonmellor> tabbing
[08:42:21] <pachet> you cant easily grab that from blur()
[08:42:40] <pachet> have to bind focus() to set a class name or some other selection method
[08:42:41] <pachet> z
[08:43:36] <simonmellor> pachet: so i would have to set a focus event observer?
[08:43:38] <caesargus_> if you're using tabbing - there is an html attribute called tabindex - I think that will allow you to alter which field is next in the tab order
[08:45:20] <juha_> oh man, i just optimized my portfoliopage! it's super cool now
[08:45:22] <jita> I have a form with a field which has 3 options with drop down menu. I want to store the value in the database when the user changes the value in that drop down menu. I have a url which does that, changes the database taking id like /edit/1 where id=1. How can i trigger load this url when user changes the drop down menu ?
[08:45:22] <jita> any example please ?
[08:45:25] <pachet> simonmellor: yes
[08:46:26] <simonmellor> pachet: your solution works best for me as I can lose focus via keyboard / mouse
[08:46:36] <optimus55> Hey I'm trying to create a progress bar that updates as a script is executing in the background. Does anyone have an idea how to update the progress bar live as the page execution completes?
[08:46:47] <simonmellor> i'll have a play :) thanks for your help pachet and caesargus_
[08:48:53] <pachet> jita: $('select').change(function(){$.get('myurl/edit/'+$(this).val())});
[08:50:03] <jita> pachet: should i use post or get ?
[08:50:07] <juha_> anyone know how to get midi or something to play on my websites background?
[08:50:16] <juha_> also, anyone know where i could get some cool 1998 midi's?
[08:50:50] <pachet> jita: it doesnt really matter, since the method you're describing implies that your backend is parsing the URI rather than the query string
[08:51:42] <jita> ok thanks a lot pachet
[09:03:20] <v0lksman> is there a way to fade in an a:hover element?  basically I have an a:hover defined in my css but if JS is available I'd like to fade it in...
[09:05:14] <JuJuBee> I am trying to use a jConfirm to control a form post (or not)...  It doesn't seem to post if I press OK... http://pastebin.com/pg5XYET6
[09:05:28] <juha_> anyone know where i could get midi's?
[09:06:52] <erichynds> v0lksman: use .hover() instead of a css class
[09:06:58] <v0lksman> juha_ #midi or http://lmgtfy.com/?q=80%27s+midi+files
[09:07:29] <juha_> http://soundcloud.com/pukkatronic/i-am-a-radical-nihilist
[09:08:02] <v0lksman> erichynds: if I want to have it degrade would I just have jquery remove the a:hover css class and replace it with .hover()?
[09:08:20] <erichynds> sure, you could do that
[09:13:09] <CorpX> can anyone reccomend me a datepicker like plugin, except it would popout a bunch of other options
[09:15:20] <juha_> yay i have background music on my personal intertube portal!
[09:17:41] <mt> i have an issue with tabs in ui, i have two tabs to two different page that are located in different folders. I am using the go straight to url techinque but it does not reneder properly. Has anyone else tried this or experienced it?
[09:22:42] <SinnerNyx> is there some way I can tell jquery to skip any remaining animations or apply them right away so that the object is where it's supposed to be in the correct size, opacity etc, as it would've been if it had run the entire animation.
[09:23:14] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[09:24:07] <caesargus_> there's a stop command? - that's awesome!
[09:29:41] <thefalling> http://pastebin.com/kRxR6hQN i can read variables in the anon function inside the post function, but i cant set variables, not sure what im doing wrong
[09:29:51] <thefalling> need to get that data somehow
[09:34:08] <JuJuBee> Anyone?  http://pastebin.com/pg5XYET6
[09:35:47] <pootpoot> anyone know what kind of browser android uses? i dont think my jquery animations are working :/
[09:37:17] <CannedCorn> guys, i keep getting  Origin file:// is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:37:36] <CannedCorn> tried looking on stack overflow and there aren't really any definitively good answers
[09:38:28] <pachet> CannedCorn: i checked google places api, they dont support jsonp
[09:38:39] <huim> hello
[09:38:55] <huim> i can't find a way to check if one of all matches input fields is empty or not
[09:39:00] <huim> can anyone please help me?
[09:39:13] <CannedCorn> pachet right
[09:39:17] <CannedCorn> so i can't just use json
[09:39:19] <CannedCorn> ?
[09:39:23] <pootpoot> huim: check the value of field.val() ?
[09:39:28] <pootpoot> length?
[09:39:35] <pachet> nope, because of cross-domain reqs
[09:39:42] <huim> pootpoot: and how without a loop?
[09:40:03] <CannedCorn> pachet so how does anyone use google autocomplete
[09:40:04] <pachet> and the return values are there from google, but you're getting them back as a jsonp script
[09:40:04] <CannedCorn> ?
[09:40:16] <CannedCorn> that can't possibly be the case
[09:40:27] <CannedCorn> that it's impossible to use straight up json
[09:40:34] <CannedCorn> why would they bother building that service/tool
[09:40:39] <pachet> its not
[09:40:48] <pachet> you can use json via a server side script
[09:40:57] <pachet> just not on a page
[09:41:04] <pootpoot> huim (forms).each( function(form) { if(form.val().length { //filled }else { //empty }  } )......... something like that
[09:41:06] <pachet> unless you use their script
[09:42:30] <CannedCorn> pachet what is their script?
[09:42:44] <ccmonster> interesting. I am running a bind('click' on elements, but the event isnt being handled correctly
[09:43:00] <ccmonster> but if i run it in the console, the event handler is initialized correctly.
[09:43:30] <pootpoot> ccmonster: if the elemnt changes or loads stuff before you click you might have to do .live('click', function() {
[09:43:40] <thefalling> not really sure why, but removing that statement to give focus fixed my error, why was that the problem?
[09:44:00] <ccmonster> is there another way other than live? My understanding is that live isnt exactly the most performant
[09:44:13] <pachet> CannedCorn: i assume the places functionality is rolled into the maps js api: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.html
[09:44:18] <ccmonster> delegate perhaps
[09:45:04] <CannedCorn> yeah but seeing as the autocomplete is quick it kind of defeats the purpose to have it call a web service to return the results, very indirect
[09:45:10] <pootpoot> if .click() works on console instead of physically clicking, then maybe youre not actually clicking it
[09:45:19] <CannedCorn> pachet i guess thats just the way it works though, thanks pachet
[09:45:43] <pachet> or maybe try supplying a different namespace
[09:45:47] <pachet> CannedCorn yw
[09:45:49] <ccmonster> I am. Because if i intialize via console, then manually click, it works.
[09:46:13] <ccmonster> however, it's being init to soon in the code, as pachet referred to I believe.
[09:46:19] <ccmonster> because I am dynamically creating those elements.
[09:46:33] <pootpoot> when are you adding the listener
[09:47:03] <ccmonster> apparently before the elements are created.
[09:47:08] <ccmonster> I am going to use delegate.
[09:47:27] <pachet> why not just bind them in the same function that creates them
[09:47:33] <pachet> ;o
[09:47:42] <pootpoot> if your listeners are added in jQuery(document).ready( function() { you shouldnt have a problem
[09:48:02] <pootpoot> unless your elements are created with js
[09:48:06] <pootpoot> instead of php
[09:48:06] <ccmonster> They are
[09:48:10] <pootpoot> k lol
[09:48:21] <mt> i have an issue with tabs in ui, i have two tabs to two different page that are located in different folders. I am using the go straight to url technique but it does not reneder properly. Has anyone else tried this or experienced it?
[09:48:29] <ccmonster> yea. they are all dynamic. get removed, rebuilt, etc on the fly with js
[09:48:37] <pootpoot> so then i would use .live
[09:48:44] <ccmonster> or delegate ...
[09:49:23] <pootpoot> ok
[09:52:04] <ccmonster> interesting, event delegate isnt firing correctly.
[09:58:53] <ProLoser|Work> heh, i almost typed "cd #tomcat" in here
[10:11:11] <ries> gents, I am using a vertical tabs plugin that fads in/out one image after the other. Now in chrome, when I go to a other tab, and come back it almost looks like that Chrome is replying very quickly the animations. no other browser exposes this.
[10:11:18] <ries> How di I prevent this?
[10:11:49] <Connor_> Got a demo?
[10:13:13] <ries> Connor_: intranet siteâ€¦ protected by firewall and non disclosure agreementsâ€¦ I am just wondering if the 'replay' visual item is something that people recognise. Chromeâ€¦. the new IE6!!!! :D
[10:13:43] <Connor_> I mean, replicate the issue on JSFiddle with the same code
[10:14:15] <Connor_> I don't really understand what reply visual item means :)
[10:14:53] <ries> Connor_: typoâ€¦ I did mean to write replay...
[10:14:59] <ries> it switches the images very fast
[10:15:12] <ries> I tried JSFiddle, but didn't understand it very well
[10:15:53] <Connor_> Oh it may be requestAnimationFrame() that is doing that
[10:16:08] <Connor_> It happens when you switch websites via the tabs in Chrome yes?
[10:16:16] <ionico> hi
[10:16:34] <ries> Connor_: correct.. when I go to a other tab, then come back I see the issue
[10:17:11] <Connor_> Well, the code is still running the background, however Chrome automatically queues the animation as, why woudl you need animation running when you can't see it
[10:17:19] <ionico> how can i move a div from one place to another ?  i only have this:  $("#foto").animate({'left': '-=80px'},'slow');  and it works, but i want to set a start and finish position
[10:17:26] <Connor_> So a way to fix this is to use .clearQueue() before the animation call
[10:17:37] <Connor_> Also, try use animate() instead of fadeIn() fadeOut()
[10:17:43] <enjoycrf> hey
[10:17:51] <Connor_> Animate works alot better with clearQueue() than fadeX()
[10:17:54] <enjoycrf> how do i uneval stuff
[10:18:05] <ries> Connor_: how can I see that requestAnimationFrame is used?
[10:18:13] <Connor_> Its an internal thing
[10:18:19] <Connor_> I don't quite understand it fully
[10:18:21] <enjoycrf> if i do script = eval(text)
[10:18:27] <Connor_> But bassicaly clearQueue() fixes the issue
[10:18:44] <enjoycrf> then do text = uneval(script)?
[10:18:45] <Connor_> You can't turn it off
[10:18:59] <Connor_> As it would be stupid to have animations running when you can't see them
[10:19:16] <GomezR> hi, i have a bit of jquery for a radio input that's not behaving as it should: http://pastebin.com/0gi1S6Jh
[10:19:33] <Connor_> @ionico use the callback to do things once the animation has finished
[10:19:40] <GomezR> it seems to show/hide randomly, and although the output shows true/false, the if loop doesn't act upon it
[10:20:06] <ries> Connor_: I agree about the stupidity, but chrome can pretend running themâ€¦ I mean, I won't care from a programming point of view how Chrome implements itâ€¦ anyways, I will look into it
[10:20:08] <dregan> hello guys, i downloaded a "coming soon" template that uses jquery function for the countdown.. here is the code snippet for the countdown ( http://pastie.org/2543968 ) ...  now everytime i refresh the page the counter resets to 471 days? how do i modify this code so that the timeout is 15 days ??
[10:20:39] <Connor_> @Ries well it does run the code, it just queues the animations, which in some cases may be the expected outcome, but in most it's not :)
[10:20:54] <Connor_> @GomezR, the variable val will be always be true iirc
[10:21:24] <Godfather_> hi, i dont know if this question is offtopic here, btw maybe someone can help me
[10:21:32] <GomezR> Connor_: actually, i think i've just realised, i've set the value to be true/false, of course, a string
[10:21:43] <enjoycrf> window.JSON.stringify?
[10:21:46] <Godfather_> i have   "document.getElementById("marca").onchange = cargaModelos;" that when i change the value of "marca" cargaModelos is loaded. The problem is that if i modify the value of "marca" with jquery   $('select[name=marca]').val('a value') the event onchange is not loaded
[10:22:14] <Connor_> @GomezR, I don't think that if statement is checking if its true, I think its checking if it exists
[10:22:18] <Connor_> I could be wrong but pretty sure
[10:22:41] <Connor_> Or not maybe
[10:22:46] <Connor_> Im wrong :P
[10:23:01] <smftre> Can anyone tell me how to loop through a tbody and check for each of it's childen tr's to see which one has an attribute called "filter" with a specific value???
[10:23:09] <GomezR> aye, just needed to do something like .val() == 'true' ? true : false
[10:23:16] <dregan> anyone know how to change the jquery countdown to a static time? currently its always showing 471 hours, and each time page is refreshed it shows 471 days
[10:23:37] <erichynds> smftre: you can do that in a selector. $("tr[filter='some_value']")
[10:23:37] <GomezR> smftre: each
[10:23:55] <GomezR> ohh nice
[10:24:12] <smftre> erichynds: I need to set all the ones that dont match to hide()..
[10:24:32] <erichynds> smftre: you can do that in a selector. $("tr[filter=!'some_value']").hide()
[10:24:38] <erichynds> eer != instead of =!
[10:24:44] <smftre> erichynds: thansk
[10:24:46] <smftre> *
[10:25:08] <ionico> how can i move and fade in at the same time ??
[10:25:29] <Connor_> animate({ opacity: 0.1, left: -=100})
[10:25:43] <Connor_> Not exactlly that
[10:25:45] <Connor_> But you get the idea
[10:25:51] <Connor_> opacity property
[10:26:52] <ionico> ok, letme try
[10:29:30] <pachet> that should be left: "-=100"
[10:31:07] <nail_> also, there is a "queue" option to animate, so $('.foo').fadeIn().animate({ left: 100}, { queue: false}) will do as well
[10:31:38] <ionico> Connor_ it works, but i need that start from opacity 0 to 1
[10:31:48] <Connor_> Set css to opacity: 0;
[10:31:54] <Connor_> Then animate to 1
[10:34:43] <ionico> nice thanks
[10:37:47] <GomezR> with the name of two radio inputs, how do i select one?
[10:37:54] <bakers>  /j ipv6
[10:38:08] <gar_onn> GomezR,  what do you mean?
[10:38:30] <GomezR> i have two radio inputs, with the same name, and i want to select one
[10:38:47] <kggle_> but differnt values?
[10:38:50] <gar_onn> $('input .... :checked')
[10:39:15] <gar_onn> GomezR,  http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[10:39:41] <gar_onn> you can get one by using the array:
[10:39:48] <GomezR> no, i want to set the value
[10:39:49] <gar_onn> $('input ...')[0]
[10:40:05] <GomezR> ie. i essentially want ('input[name=foo
[10:40:19] <GomezR> ie. i essentially want ('input[name=foo]).val('bar');
[10:40:35] <GomezR> which would select the radio with 'bar' as a value
[10:41:06] <nail_> [value="bar"
[10:41:08] <gar_onn> $('input[name=foo][val=bar]').val('bar');
[10:41:08] <nail_> ]
[10:41:48] <GomezR> oh crap. i'm getting confused! s/select/set
[10:43:35] <GomezR> ok nm, i solved my problem by manually triggering an even to set the correct values!
[10:52:59] <surfdue> anyone know why a .val wouldnt return the latest value in safari 5? but in firefox would work fine..
[10:56:46] <velts> how can I write a function with jquery so that this will work: $('#myItem').isNullorEmtpy();
[10:57:15] <velts> i am not even sure what to google :{
[10:57:30] <ProLoser|Work> is it a form input or an element?
[10:57:40] <velts> form
[10:57:43] <ProLoser|Work> .val()
[10:57:48] <ProLoser|Work> the whole form?
[10:57:51] <ProLoser|Work> or just an input from it
[10:57:57] <velts> just an input
[10:58:03] <ProLoser|Work> ya then .val() is what you want
[10:58:11] <velts> i want to check if the .val() is null or empty...
[10:58:22] <ProLoser|Work> right, and you know how to do basic flow control
[10:58:28] <ProLoser|Work> or at least i'm assuming you do
[10:58:41] <velts> hmm..
[10:58:42] <ProLoser|Work> if (somedata == null or undefined
[10:58:50] <velts> not sure what you mean
[10:59:18] <erichynds> .val().length === 0
[10:59:21] <velts> basically I am wondering how to extend functions from an element
[10:59:38] <erichynds> val() isn't going to return null
[10:59:39] <velts> the isNullorEmpty was just an example
[10:59:47] <nail_> ?extend @ velts
[10:59:47] <bot-t> velts, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[11:00:26] <velts> "Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object."
[11:00:35] <nail_> read further
[11:02:15] <erichynds> velts: basically, $.fn.isEmptyOrNull = function(){ };
[11:02:23] <nail_> velts: you can apply that to jQuery.fn
[11:02:28] <erichynds> `this` refers to the matched elements in the function
[11:02:57] <velts> nail_: that is what I was trying but it wasnt working.. http://pastebin.com/10DCR3Rx
[11:05:35] <nail_> velts: define "wasnt working", that seems valid
[11:06:06] <velts> its not logging out anuthin in the function
[11:06:13] <velts> anything
[11:07:11] <nail_> velts: well are you running it with a selector that actually selects something?
[11:07:30] <velts> muth*@$%S
[11:07:36] <velts> self ownage
[11:07:45] <velts> had it inside a click event
[11:08:21] <nail_> btw, 'this' in that function will be the resulting jquery object of what you selected
[11:08:28] <nail_> no need to double-wrap
[11:14:52] <amitprakash> hi.. in jquery .. if I have a function X() { $.post( url, function( data) { return data;}); will X return data?
[11:15:03] <amitprakash> basically.. is $.post blocking in nature
[11:16:03] <amitprakash> if its aynchronous.. how can I make it synchonous in nature
[11:16:09] <acidjazz> i have two divs inside a div i have a click event on .. how can i tell which of those two divs are that i clicked inside the outer click function?
[11:16:47] <sparuvu> event.preventDefault(); is not working for me for submit button
[11:16:47] <sparuvu> am I missing something here ?
[11:17:22] <evan_luck> amitprakash: throw a return in front of $.post and I think it will (not 100% though)
[11:17:48] <amitprakash> evan_luck, that won't help as long as $.post is async
[11:18:56] <evan_luck> amitprakash: maybe throw it in a var outside the function?
[11:19:17] <evan_luck> timeout poll it? I dunno man that feels haxy
[11:19:28] <amitprakash> evan_luck, doesn't help me if I want to setCustomvalidity on form submit
[11:20:54] <acidjazz> like lets say i have a div thats 300x300 and two divs inside that are 100x100 .. i have a .click event on the outer 300x300 div .. any way i can tell which div if i clicked one of the inner divs?
[11:21:38] <evan_luck> amitprakash: maybe check out the jqXHR callbacks? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:21:52] <evan_luck> use the success callback to deal with it when it's available
[11:21:53] <evan_luck> ?
[11:22:28] <sphinxxx> how do you take control of the back button in jquery?
[11:22:29] <evan_luck> acidjazz: bind a click event to the inner divs instead of the outer
[11:22:41] <acidjazz> evan_luck: what if thats not an option?
[11:22:56] <ionico> how can i delay this:  $(".parrafo").animate({opacity: 1},1000);
[11:23:01] <evan_luck> acidjazz: iframe?
[11:23:24] <evan_luck> ionico: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[11:23:32] <amitprakash> evan_luck, this works $.ajaxSetup( { async : false});
[11:23:36] <pachet> sphinxxx: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[11:23:39] <evan_luck> excellent
[11:23:50] <sphinxxx> acidjazz, you can use the event argument in the callback
[11:23:52] <amitprakash> ionico, settimeout
[11:23:54] <sphinxxx> tells you where the click was
[11:24:07] <amitprakash> acidjazz, use bubble
[11:24:50] <amitprakash> acidjazz, http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[11:27:15] <sphinxxx> i'm looking at history.js
[11:27:41] <sphinxxx> what i want to do is intercept the event of clicking the back button, and run some code , as well as preventing the back action for occuring
[11:29:45] <pachet> no chance
[11:30:01] <pachet> best you can do is mimic continuity with hashes or server-sides
[11:31:21] <amitprakash> sphinxxx, you can use unload event to intercept when someone is moving away from the page
[11:32:06] <amitprakash> sphinxxx, http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Mastering_The_Back_Button_With_Javascript
[11:34:17] <sphinxxx> thanks
[11:46:51] <blindMoe> someone mind checking this out and helping me get the image to not fade in/out twice:  http://jsfiddle.net/WV7VQ/
[11:47:11] <blindMoe> I have event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault called but still it seems like it is being called twice
[11:51:10] <pachet> you're binding two different events
[11:51:30] <pachet> they're each getting called independently, and stopProp has no effect on the other event
[11:51:39] <pachet> *triggered
[11:51:45] <blindMoe> yeah but I check for which event is being triggered
[11:52:48] <pachet> fadeIn and fadeOut don't just modify the opacity
[11:52:52] <pachet> they also toggle display:none
[11:53:11] <blindMoe> yeah I know
[11:53:20] <nail_> blindMoe: use mouseenter instead of mouseover
[11:54:15] <blindMoe> nail_: one step closer.. now it only fades in / out once.. but it is fading out befrore the mouse leaves the div :/
[11:54:37] <blindMoe> hehe this worked perfectly with .hover()  but I had to switch it to $.live because there is ajax created content involved
[11:55:03] <ccmonster> you can try delegate as well
[11:55:17] <blindMoe> I was thinking that.. I read a little about it but have never used it
[11:55:32] <nail_> blindMoe: and mouseleave instead of mouseout
[11:56:19] <pachet> zz
[11:56:23] <tbranyen> tjholowaychuk: get outta heeeere
[11:56:25] <pachet> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/NFQSt/
[11:56:38] <tjholowaychuk> tbranyen haha :)
[11:56:43] <blindMoe> mouseenter / mouseleave works perfectly
[11:57:05] <tbranyen> mods!
[11:57:09] <blindMoe> pachet: that is still flashing it twice :)
[11:57:27] <blindMoe> nail_: thanks for that.. appreciate the help
[11:57:34] <nail_> no worries
[12:00:38] <jeffsmykil> So I have this d-pad which is broken into nine divs the top middle, bottom middle, middle left, and middle right, all trigger an event I want to also trigger a hiding of the dpad and then show a static "rocked" image for a a quarter of a second and then go back to the 3x3 dpad
[12:00:55] <jeffsmykil> im pretty sure i cant animate hide/show and add class
[12:01:05] <jeffsmykil> and i dont want to cut each image up into nine pieces
[12:04:07] <jeffsmykil> i can only queue animations afaik
[12:04:58] <jeffsmykil> its like i need an a seperate click and let go of click function
[12:06:08] <pmcgovern> hello all - anyone using the validator plugin?
[12:07:12] <Genesis730> i have a callback function that tests if (span.text() == 1) { (the value of a span) but it keeps testing the first span, how can i set it to this.span.text  ??
[12:07:26] <Genesis730> so it checks the span i clicked?
[12:07:44] <pmcgovern> does that span have a unique id?
[12:08:07] <Genesis730> it does, it's stored in a var span
[12:08:49] <pmcgovern> if it has a unique id, reference it as $('#idName').whataverYoureTryingToDo;
[12:09:19] <Genesis730> so if($('#uniqueID').span.text   ?
[12:09:31] <pmcgovern> Using the validator plugin, if there any way, within invalidHandler, to add a class to all form fields that contained errors?
[12:09:47] <Genesis730> if($('#uniqueID').span.text() == 1) { i mean
[12:10:01] <pmcgovern> is #uniqueID the id of the span?
[12:10:08] <pmcgovern> or the element containing the span?
[12:10:26] <Genesis730> it's the ID of the span
[12:11:05] <pmcgovern> then it would be if($('#UniqueID').text == '1'){
[12:11:17] <Genesis730> :) just tryin to get syntax right...
[12:11:48] <pmcgovern> Anyone know anything about invalidHandler within the validator class?
[12:16:11] <ccmonster> wel damn, this .live() wont work. booo
[12:17:01] <jeffsmykil> im guessing this isn't kosher?  $(".pancontrol").hide().delay(218000).show();
[12:18:25] <evan_luck> ccmonster: you tried delegate?
[12:19:15] <ccmonster> i am using delegate right now
[12:19:30] <ccmonster> the first part of the delegate should be on a element that is pre-rendered, correct?
[12:19:41] <Genesis730> if i define a variable span: span,  how would I call that in   if ($('#span').text() == 1) {
[12:20:07] <ccmonster> $('span')
[12:20:23] <ccmonster> var span = $('span'); span.text();
[12:20:38] <ccmonster> butt that would be every span on the page.
[12:20:41] <ccmonster> or on the dom
[12:21:09] <Genesis730> span = $_GET['spanID'];
[12:21:09] <evan_luck> ccmonster: correct, you can always throw body in the first part of delegate but if there's something deeper that'd be better
[12:21:21] <ccmonster> yea, i am doing that.
[12:21:27] <Genesis730> somethin to that effect
[12:21:39] <ccmonster> not sure what's up. with delegate/live it shouldn't matter when it's initialized , so im not sure whats up
[12:21:46] <evan_luck> Genesis730: are you working with javascript or PHP?
[12:21:58] <ccmonster> Genesis730, you need to loop though that variable, because it's an array of spans
[12:22:28] <ccmonster> var s = $('span'); s.each(function(i,item){console.log('item',item);});
[12:22:58] <ccmonster> or $.each(s,function(i,item){console.log('item',item);})
[12:23:35] <Genesis730> ccmonster: I just did an alert, each time I click, it changes
[12:23:43] <Genesis730> and it's just the one i click
[12:23:49] <ccmonster> um, demo?
[12:24:27] <ccmonster> ? demo @ Genesis730
[12:24:28] <bot-t> Genesis730, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:25:53] <pmcgovern> ccmonster - are you by chance familiar with the validator plugin for query?
[12:26:26] <ccmonster> I haven't used it in ages.
[12:26:30] <ccmonster> So not very.
[12:26:49] <ccmonster> It's likely changed a ton since I used it 2, or so years ago.
[12:26:58] <pmcgovern> damn
[12:27:01] <pmcgovern> ok thank you
[12:27:04] <surfdue> anyone know why a .val wouldnt return the latest value in safari 5? but in firefox would work fine..
[12:27:06] <ccmonster> Just ask your question.
[12:27:29] <ccmonster> ?demo @ surfdue
[12:27:30] <bot-t> surfdue, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:27:38] <surfdue> ccmonster: i cant sorry
[12:27:43] <surfdue> its like 1000 lines of code.
[12:28:02] <pmcgovern> you can create a function for invalidHandler - wondering if there is a way to addClass to all fields that have errors - so far it seems as though it is generic for all errors contained
[12:28:22] <ccmonster> got a link to the docs where it shows the invalidhandler
[12:28:36] <ccmonster> well, surfdue , just the part you are having an issue with.
[12:29:07] <ccmonster> even a single line of code, or that function should be enough.
[12:29:08] <erichynds> surfdue: what does safari say when you access the .value property directly?
[12:30:22] <pmcgovern> ccmonster: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[12:31:39] <ccmonster> so, there is an invalidclass
[12:32:15] <ccmonster> What is your specific issue pmcgovern
[12:32:33] <pmcgovern> trying to add a class to all form fields that have been found to contain errors
[12:32:41] <ccmonster> there already is one
[12:32:54] <pmcgovern> syntax would be addClass('formFieldError')
[12:33:03] <ccmonster> errorClass: "invalid"
[12:33:06] <pmcgovern> just not sure how to grab all affected form fields
[12:33:18] <ccmonster> $('.invalid')
[12:33:21] <pmcgovern> that's it?
[12:33:30] <ccmonster> got a demo pmcgovern ?
[12:33:40] <ccmonster> or a page someone can hit?
[12:33:45] <pmcgovern> this is why I love query - and also wish the documentation were more in-depth and navigated easier ;p;
[12:34:00] <pmcgovern> nothing I can show publicly
[12:34:02] <ccmonster> I LOVE the nav. But then again I'm use to it, 3 years later
[12:34:09] <pmcgovern> but you've pointed me in the right direction
[12:34:16] <ccmonster> ok, so when you do the validate
[12:34:25] <ccmonster> set your class, else I think it defaults to 'invalid'
[12:34:40] <ccmonster> after that, just target the $.('.invalid')
[12:34:50] <ccmonster> , rather....  $('.invalid')
[12:34:56] <pigdude> jquery is behaving predictably weird
[12:35:03] <ccmonster> predictably? lol
[12:35:08] <pigdude> in getComputedStyle, elem.ownerDocument is undefined
[12:35:20] <pigdude> if ( !(defaultView = elem.ownerDocument.defaultView) ) {
[12:35:48] <ccmonster> ok..?
[12:36:01] <surfdue> erichynds: when you mean directly, what do you mean
[12:36:12] <pmcgovern> this is the document ready js, ccmonster: http://pastebin.com/xcQMpRbD
[12:36:22] <erichynds> surfdue: isntead of $("#elem").val(), do $("#elem")[0].value
[12:36:24] <pmcgovern> invalidHandler @ line 23
[12:36:26] <pigdude> so my small script breaks
[12:36:42] <surfdue> erichynds: says the value
[12:36:47] <pigdude> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/477134/
[12:36:56] <erichynds> surfdue: that you expect to see?
[12:37:16] <surfdue> ayes
[12:37:17] <jeffsmykil> I'm wondering why this function only works the first time, but on the second it does not.  http://pastie.org/2544543
[12:38:42] <ccmonster> ok, where in that are you having issues pmcgovern ?
[12:39:05] <pmcgovern> no issues - just not sure how to tell it to add the class to all fields with errors
[12:39:06] <ccmonster> What are you trying to do with the error class?
[12:39:13] <ccmonster> it already does that believe
[12:39:26] <pmcgovern> just add a class to all form fields that have issues - so I can add a border via css to them
[12:39:29] <pmcgovern> highlight them in red
[12:39:46] <pmcgovern> so it automatically add the class 'invalid'?
[12:39:49] <pmcgovern> that's fantastic
[12:39:59] <jeffsmykil> @ccmonster if you get a chance http://pastie.org/2544543
[12:40:02] <pmcgovern> i'll try adding that css definition now
[12:40:32] <erichynds> surfdue: what value does .val() give you vs. the value property, and what type of element are you calling it on
[12:40:33] <ccmonster> pmcgovern, http://pastebin.com/CVZJy8Mv , right above your invalidHandler
[12:40:33] <erichynds> ?
[12:40:37] <ccmonster> i added the invalidclass
[12:41:07] <pmcgovern> christ that's simple
[12:41:09] <pmcgovern> thanks, man
[12:41:14] <ccmonster> no problem.
[12:41:19] <ccmonster> jeffsmykil, what's your issue?
[12:41:37] <jeffsmykil> works the first time, second time it shows the dummy control but does not hide
[12:41:50] <ccmonster> got a demo?
[12:41:52] <ccmonster> that would help a ton
[12:41:58] <ccmonster> animation can be tricky.
[12:42:52] <jeffsmykil> I don't have a demo, I was hoping the function would be enough
[12:43:04] <jeffsmykil> it works perfectly on the first click
[12:43:12] <pmcgovern> ccmonster: that worked wonderfully - thanks again
[12:43:15] <ccmonster> np
[12:44:08] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: not sure if there is something inherent with delay that stops it from happening again?
[12:44:51] <ccmonster> yea. queing  and stopping...with animation.. hmm
[12:44:54] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: actually queue seems to be the real issue
[12:44:56] <ccmonster> what happens the second time
[12:45:19] <jeffsmykil> it doesnt do any of the stuff after the .queue
[12:45:50] <ccmonster> ok
[12:45:56] <ccmonster> remove the queu, and lets see what happens.
[12:46:36] <jeffsmykil> so just $('.dummycontrol').show().delay(150).hide();
[12:47:13] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2544591
[12:47:45] <ccmonster> try to use the callbcks, see if that cleans up the animation a bit
[12:48:58] <pmcgovern> ccmonster - that's all plying the class to both the input and the labelâ€¦ know a way for it to not affect the label?
[12:49:34] <ccmonster> nope. What's your issue though? Just target it diff in css.
[12:49:40] <ccmonster> input.invalid
[12:50:25] <pmcgovern> yeah - realized that right after I asked lol
[12:50:25] <pmcgovern> sorry
[12:50:29] <pigdude> why did this place have to choose jquery
[12:50:29] <ccmonster> np
[12:50:30] <jeffsmykil> @ccmonster worse now ;)
[12:50:32] <pigdude> :^(
[12:50:36] <ccmonster> this place..?
[12:50:41] <ccmonster> haha worse? why so?.
[12:50:47] <ccmonster> I just want to know what's happening.
[12:50:52] <ccmonster> or ..not happening
[12:50:57] <jeffsmykil> doesn't do it the first time now ;)
[12:51:04] <ccmonster> haah
[12:51:06] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: it;'s a d-pad
[12:51:09] <jeffsmykil> when you press up
[12:51:16] <ccmonster> oh, you are binding to keys
[12:51:18] <jeffsmykil> it shows a up-pressed d-pad for a second
[12:51:19] <pigdude> the library has such strange conventions, like jQuery.prototype.map() returning something other than an Array
[12:51:27] <jeffsmykil> and then the other one
[12:51:38] <ccmonster> map? is a map.
[12:51:38] <jeffsmykil> nope binding to clicks right now
[12:51:43] <ccmonster> oh. ok
[12:51:55] <jeffsmykil> yeah its a map
[12:52:29] <ccmonster> ? map
[12:52:30] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:53:04] <ccmonster> and those values are array in, array out
[12:53:22] <pigdude> $.map(jQ) and jQ.map() producing different return protos is in poor taste IMO
[12:53:42] <jeffsmykil> fuck i just got called to something else
[12:54:19] <ccmonster> one is an array , the other is jquery obj
[12:54:23] <ccmonster> i believe.
[12:54:35] <pigdude> yes, but such naming implies that $.map is sentinel
[12:54:45] <pigdude> or that $.map would defer to arg1.proto.map
[12:54:51] <pigdude> anywho
[12:54:54] * pigdude wanders off
[12:54:58] <ccmonster> haha
[12:55:12] <ccmonster> Well, i've always thought maybe they should be switched,
[12:55:19] <ccmonster> but liek them both :)
[12:55:30] <pigdude> :^)
[13:04:42] <ravenzz> mekwall are you there?
[13:08:30] <mekwall> ravenzz: yup
[13:08:57] <ravenzz> are you from sweden?
[13:11:31] <mekwall> ravenzz: yup
[13:12:13] <ravenzz> uhm is 49k SEK/month a good income there?
[13:12:50] <mekwall> yes, but also depends on the work
[13:13:09] <mekwall> you will lose about 25% to taxes
[13:13:12] <ravenzz> front-end developer
[13:13:20] <ravenzz> oh nice
[13:13:21] <mekwall> where at?
[13:13:34] <ravenzz> stockholm
[13:13:35] <mekwall> well, yes... then its a very good pay
[13:14:09] <mekwall> 49k per month is close to executive pay levels
[13:14:23] <ravenzz> I see
[13:14:28] <mekwall> got a job offer?
[13:15:20] <ravenzz> well i made some calculations at least 57€/hour * 5hours * 5 days * 4 weeks
[13:15:49] <mekwall> they pay in euro? :P
[13:16:20] <ravenzz> uhm no I suppose that the guy from the recruiting company made the change for me
[13:16:43] <mekwall> ravenzz: well, tbh it feels too high
[13:17:34] <Zeph88> Hi - I have a form with a section that needs to be repeatable. I have my rows setup in divs. I need one of the fields that's duplicated to be able to auto-complete. I have either auto-complete or duplication working, but can't seem to get both. Any suggestions?
[13:18:07] <mekwall> ravenzz: the company pay about 50% of that in taxes as well, and for that amount they would be able to out source it or hire a consultant
[13:18:18] <ravenzz> same to me but he wrote 57€ to 80€ per hour
[13:18:25] <mekwall> wtf
[13:18:37] <astropirate> i write 2 words per hour beat that
[13:18:41] <mekwall> is it google or what? :D
[13:18:44] <ravenzz> lol
[13:19:03] <ravenzz> I don't know, and this make me curious
[13:20:06] <tksw> how can i get the height of a div containing a mg without setting the height of the image
[13:21:16] <mekwall> ravenzz: well 48k is the middle wage for a Head of IT
[13:21:24] <EriSanHome> What am i doing wrong in http://jsfiddle.net/EjW4h/ It updates only the 1st div. Any idea please?
[13:21:27] <mekwall> ravenzz: and that's with 12.5 years experience
[13:21:56] <mekwall> ravenzz: also, it's an executive position which means that you are probably bossing some other peeps as well :P
[13:22:19] <mekwall> ravenzz: so 57€ to 80€ per hour for a front-end job is just silly
[13:22:43] <mekwall> EriSanHome: everything
[13:22:55] <mekwall> EriSanHome: first of all, you do not use an interval to poll a server
[13:23:11] <mekwall> EriSanHome: that will lead to a self-inflicted DDOS :)
[13:23:48] <EriSanHome> mekwall, any link on how to do it properly ?
[13:24:27] <mekwall> EriSanHome: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/EjW4h/1/
[13:24:29] <mekwall> something like that
[13:24:43] * mekwall slaps himself
[13:25:05] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/EjW4h/2/
[13:25:34] <mekwall> EriSanHome: but I'd use .ajax instead
[13:25:39] <mekwall> so that you can do some proper error handling
[13:26:06] <EriSanHome> mekwall, thx, i'll try this quickly first
[13:26:18] <ravenzz> mekwall by the way I think that these guys from recruitment companies are damned confused or what does experience means
[13:27:07] <mekwall> ravenzz: can you tell me which company it is?
[13:27:18] <ravenzz> i wrote html5 (learing) in my cv and he is pretty sure that I am able to write html5
[13:27:42] <ravenzz> mekwall I don't know which company he is representing
[13:28:07] <erichynds> also, companies typically pay recruiters big $$, which often lowers the offer you'll get
[13:29:20] <mekwall> EriSanHome: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/EjW4h/4/
[13:29:30] <mekwall> that one is working and using jsfiddles echo service
[13:30:06] <ravenzz> I have to go sorry
[13:30:25] <ravenzz> see u
[13:30:40] <ravenzz> oh thank you, of course
[13:35:02] <EriSanHome> mekwall, using your latest link, it still updates only the 1st div. ANy idea?
[13:35:31] <mekwall> not without seeing more code
[13:36:35] <EriSanHome> there is not realy more code. 2 div's on a page, and your function to pull the jason data and put the 2 values on the div's
[13:37:13] <EriSanHome> the jason data that is returned: {"TempOut": "26.4", "TempIn": "26.5"}
[13:37:45] <mekwall> then its not selecting your element i guess
[13:42:22] <GeO`> hey
[13:42:30] <GeO`> how can I insert a row in the middle of a table ?
[13:43:07] <GeO`> if I use $(#some row of the table).append(another row) it is appended INSIDE the row and not right after
[13:47:15] <EriSanHome> mekwall, here's the full code. Could it be that there's a } missing somewhere?
[13:47:42] <EriSanHome> mekwall, link: http://pastebin.com/gHg4uvfQ
[13:48:09] <mekwall> EriSanHome: dude... you have to close the divs properly
[13:48:15] <mekwall> <div id="foo"></div>
[13:48:40] <mekwall> and remove the / from <br> if you aren't using XHTML
[13:50:13] <EriSanHome> mekwall, thx buddy, that was it
[14:01:46] <oojacoboo> is there a way to load jquery script into the DOM and have the code in that same script use query?
[14:01:59] <oojacoboo> fucking macosx spell correction!
[14:02:59] <oojacoboo> like, javascript in the DOM is parsed out in order of the DOM correct?
[14:03:06] <oojacoboo> so if you do something like...
[14:03:17] <astropirate> huuu?
[14:03:18] <oojacoboo> document.write("<script type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js'></scr"+"ipt>");
[14:03:36] <oojacoboo> it will come after the point where you inset it, so anything else in that script won't get parsed?
[14:03:44] <astropirate> oojacoboo: if that script that you are loading is calling jquery then yest
[14:03:56] <oojacoboo> astropirate: ??
[14:04:12] <oojacoboo> if I have a script and I do that +++ other stuff
[14:04:30] <oojacoboo> other stuff won't get executed b/c the jquery gets loaded AFTER that
[14:04:39] <oojacoboo> is that correct?
[14:04:45] <oojacoboo> and if so, is there a way to correct that?
[14:04:58] <astropirate> give the script an id
[14:05:06] <astropirate> then listen for the "load" event on that id
[14:05:10] <astropirate> then execute your script
[14:05:15] <astropirate> within the callback
[14:05:35] <oojacoboo> <script id="string" > ?
[14:05:59] <oojacoboo> or just something like jquery.js?id=string
[14:06:48] <darcyclarke> ?attr
[14:06:49] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[14:08:02] <oojacoboo> astropirate: I'd need to use standard js event listener for that right, not the jquery api
[14:08:10] <oojacoboo> since it won't know how to interpret the api yet
[14:08:16] <astropirate> oojacoboo: its still the load event
[14:08:31] <oojacoboo> im sorry, I'm not following
[14:08:39] <oojacoboo> what's still the load event?
[14:09:01] <astropirate> when the script is loaded, the "load" event is still goign to be fired regardless of if there is jquery or not
[14:09:36] <oojacoboo> astropirate: are you saying that the load event markup is the same for jquery as basic js?
[14:09:41] <astropirate> oojacoboo: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp
[14:09:55] <astropirate> its actually onLoad event in standard browser js
[14:10:49] <astropirate> oojacoboo: actually use this. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[14:12:01] <oojacoboo> astropirate: thanks mate
[14:12:09] <astropirate> np
[14:14:11] <learn_C> hello! i need to get visible and clickable elements
[14:14:49] <astropirate> learn_C: me too :(
[14:16:00] <learn_C> really visible(as if there is a transparent div over a button, or hidden if there is nontransparent element over it)
[14:16:56] <astropirate> learn_C: hmm you will need to do some hacky things for that. you COULD do that but there is probably a better way of doing what youar ethinking of
[14:17:43] <astropirate> i'd get the position and its dimentions then search for other DOM elements that are "covering" it up and check their transparancy and then decide if it is hiddne or not
[14:18:22] <learn_C> astropirate have you done it? can we cooperate?
[14:18:46] <astropirate> i have done some stuff in the past
[14:18:56] <astropirate> like this*
[14:19:14] <learn_C> buut?
[14:19:20] <astropirate> for a client
[14:19:23] <astropirate> codes confidential :D
[14:19:28] <learn_C> ah...
[14:20:15] <glaksmono> is there a way to do something like $(iframe).ready(function() {}) ???
[14:20:24] <glaksmono> does that mean that it makes sure to get executed after the content of the iframe ready?
[14:20:27] <astropirate> learn_C: but you should do this, you will learn a bunch
[14:20:34] <Dave_Stein> glaksmono yeah if its on same domain, but not like that
[14:20:53] <Dave_Stein> $( $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow ).ready
[14:20:55] <Whirl3d> simple question: how do you make a checkbox input element checked or unchecked programmatically.
[14:21:04] <Dave_Stein> glaksmono that will target the window of inside the iframe
[14:21:09] <learn_C> astropirate i just thought there was some selector that could do it for me
[14:21:30] <learn_C> astropirate i am not really good at jquery, so i came here to ask you
[14:21:32] <astropirate> learn_C: you can check if an element is visible but not if something else is covering it up
[14:21:46] <astropirate> by default with jquery
[14:21:55] <learn_C> astropirate mootols?
[14:22:05] <astropirate> dont' think so
[14:22:16] <astropirate> haven't used it but have browsed its API
[14:22:30] <astropirate> i'ma go make noodles now :)
[14:22:36] <learn_C> astropirate did you do it on your own or you used some libs?
[14:22:51] <astropirate> i did it. its not as hard as you tihnik
[14:22:56] <astropirate> if you are familiar with programming
[14:23:00] <astropirate> in general
[14:23:02] <glaksmono> Dave_Stein: so, that would make sure that the whole content of the iframe is loaded right? including it's DOM?
[14:23:19] <Dave_Stein> glaksmono it's idnetical to doing $(window).ready on the actual window instead of iframe window
[14:23:25] <glaksmono> or it should be like? [0].contentWindow.document ?
[14:23:37] <Dave_Stein> glaksmono if you want to target document.ready, yes
[14:23:42] <learn_C> astropirate first of all it was not my job, our joniour has to do it but i really doubt he whether can
[14:23:47] <PhonicUK> hey all, i'm having an issue with the 'drop' animation in the latest jQuery UI - it makes the element I'm appling it to jump to the left before performing the effect
[14:23:59] <learn_C> astropirate but now... funny task to check my skillz
[14:24:08] <Dave_Stein> contentWindow.document is valid, so is contentWindow.document.body because it's all just a synonym for window inside iframe
[14:25:09] <PhonicUK> infact it jumps to the absolute left edge of the screen
[14:26:33] <glaksmono> Dave_Stein: is the scope at that time is the document?
[14:27:02] <Dave_Stein> that line has nothing to do with scope
[14:27:10] <Dave_Stein> it's scoped depending where you define it
[14:27:25] <Dave_Stein> document.getElementById( 'myiframe' ) referes to iframe element
[14:27:39] <Dave_Stein> $('#myiframe') is jquery, $('#myiframe')[0] is synonymous with the above line
[14:28:07] <Dave_Stein> $x =  $('#myiframe')[0].contentWindow is a reference to the window, but jQuery can't do anything
[14:28:30] <Dave_Stein> $x =  $( $('#myiframe')[0].contentWindow ); is now a reference to iframe window as if you did $(window) in the main window
[14:28:47] <astropirate> learn_C: sounds like you guys need a JavaScript developer :)
[14:30:10] <learn_C> astropirate and a php and a pl/sql and a java and objective c and mysql and ...... developers
[14:30:56] <astropirate> learn_C: what kind of group are you guys? web dev?
[14:31:29] <learn_C> astropirate nope. integration & support.
[14:31:37] <astropirate> ahh
[14:32:33] <oojacoboo> astropirate: so, one more question, I can't modify the DOM to have an onload event on the <body> or anything.  I'd set an id on the <script> that's getting inserted, but how can I setup a listener for that?
[14:33:10] <oojacoboo> soâ€¦ var.addEventLister("what?", function(), false);
[14:33:16] <astropirate> oojacoboo: sure you can. you don't need jquery to mess with the dom
[14:33:24] <astropirate> jquery uses regualr old javascript

[15:00:15] <glaksmono> how do you check if th epermission is denied because of the XSS?
[15:00:51] <savid> Is it possible to get the page body's width, regardless of viewport width?  That is, if content is 1000px wide, and the window is 800px wide, it should return 1000,  however if the window is 1200 px wide it should return 1200.
[15:01:03] <learn_C> glaksmono what kind of permission?
[15:01:31] <glaksmono> sooo... i'm trying to access the content of the iframe
[15:01:37] <glaksmono> but the content might be coming form other server
[15:01:42] <glaksmono> so in that case permission denied
[15:04:16] <savid> Or let me put it this way,   without knowing what elements are inside <body>,  is it possible to get the width of the page content when the viewport is smaller than the content (causing horiz. scroll bar)?
[15:04:48] <savid> I tried $('body').width(),  but it seems to return the width of the viewport.
[15:07:26] <White--> I integrated jqueryui datepicker for one of my input elements. On page load, there's a pretty big "div" visible all the time until i first click into the input
[15:08:11] <White--> Do I do something wrong? I would have expected the datepicker div to have the .ui-helper-hidden class assigned or something like that
[15:09:51] <SmartTowel> test
[15:11:59] <White--> Ah nevermind, I used a theme which I generated some time ago for 1.8.1, while I updated to 1.8.16, which didn't work together
[15:32:10] <z1000> whats the best way to do like .parent().next()
[15:32:24] <Woet> .. by doing .parent().next()?
[15:32:29] <z1000> hmm not working
[15:32:39] <Woet> so you want the best way to do something like not working?
[15:32:52] <z1000> lol
[15:32:58] <z1000> the logic of parent >> next
[15:33:03] <Woet> oh, i see
[15:33:24] <z1000> ill show u maybe u can help point me in right direction
[15:34:02] <z1000> http://pastie.org/2545381
[15:35:29] <z1000> any ideas?
[15:35:40] <oojacoboo> so, I'm trying to get around an origin issues, I am wondering how might be best to setup a script on the target domain to get the html contents of the site, then call that script from the destination domain and use the html contents of it for that domain's DOM
[15:35:42] <learn_C> z1000 you need to get the next child of the parent after your object
[15:35:55] <z1000> well thats not my exact code thats a dumbed down version
[15:36:20] <z1000> ahh got it :P
[15:36:21] <z1000> $(this).next('.proj-txt').find('a.btn-view').click();
[15:36:32] <z1000> would u say thats best practices tho?
[15:37:37] <learn_C> z1000 siblings
[15:38:12] <Ogredude> ok, I'm working with a jquery ui autocomplete and I have some questions about it, but I'm now having a hard time figuring out how to get it into jsfiddle because its data source is my Rails app
[15:38:36] <Ogredude> and I'm mangling the incoming JSON slighly to add a "new customer" option
[15:39:02] <Ogredude> so I'm not quite sure how to replace the remote source with a local variable containing some example JSON
[15:39:21] <z1000> learn_C, so change next to siblings
[15:40:21] <maltray> Ohai there, so im making a news add, news will can have files that will be listed on a table (with a checkbox) to be serlected so the relation would be created, theres a problem with that, files may be more than 500, so list would be LARGE, so i was thinking, how hard would it be to make a jquery plugin for a "search form" on a table (it would work like autocomplete..)
[15:40:53] <learn_C> z1000 do you need to use btn-view?
[15:41:02] <z1000> 2 links to open a lightbox
[15:41:08] <learn_C> z1000 or you just want to find next sibleng?
[15:41:09] <z1000> one will be a thumb one is a button
[15:41:29] <z1000> well its child of a sibling is the issue I had
[15:41:48] <Ogredude> hell, I can't get it to do *ANYTHING* in jsfiddle
[15:41:58] <Ogredude> it can't even find the selector $('.auto_search_complete') in there
[15:43:36] <Ogredude> nm, got that bit working
[15:44:10] <Ogredude> ok, so I can't get the autocomplete to work in jsfiddle, but here's what I have. http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/
[15:44:58] <Ogredude> I'm running into problems when I select an item from the list, it's blanking out the Name field instead of putting the customer name in it.  I'm wondering if self isn't what I think it is inside there.
[15:47:36] <georgeblazer> hi there, any suggestions about jquery lightbox plugin that's tiny in size and can open external pages in the iframe like prettyPhoto?
[15:47:44] <georgeblazer> the objective is to find something that's small
[15:47:50] <georgeblazer> prettyPhoto is 50+K

[15:50:42] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:50:50] <ProLoser|Work> i'm looking for some recommendations working with templates
[15:51:20] <Ogredude> blah.  It's not that, even when I $("#auto_search_customer").val("something"); in the select event, it blanks out the value.  It runs all the other stuff in the select event.
[15:51:29] <Ogredude> wtf am I doing wrong here?
[15:51:38] <moo-_-> how one uses jQuery UI theme sprites?
[15:54:56] * moo-_- founds out about ui-icon
[15:55:14] <AfroTurf> to select either or selector its $("div, p")?
[15:55:24] <devinrolsen> two very incomplete sentences.
[15:55:38] <AfroTurf> yes
[15:56:27] <devinrolsen> $("div, p") selects both div and p.
[15:56:28] * Ogredude bangs on the computer, "Is this thing on?"
[15:56:55] <AfroTurf> that's what i thought thanks
[15:57:27] <devinrolsen> AfroTurf in css div,p = the same thing in jquery
[15:57:31] <AfroTurf> devinrolsen: if one of the selectors is undefined does it still work on the other selector?
[15:58:37] <devinrolsen> yes
[15:58:42] <learn_C>  z1000 of even http://jsfiddle.net/3rrPU/1/
[15:58:59] <AfroTurf> thanks
[15:59:35] * Ogredude bangs his IRC client against a brick wall repeatedly, hoping to make it work
[15:59:50] <devinrolsen> hoping to make IRC work?
[16:00:10] <learn_C> who can explain me the magic of displaying elements in dom? like: http://jsfiddle.net/kpf8K/1/  or http://jsfiddle.net/ZhJk5/1/
[16:00:58] <Ogredude> devinrolsen:  well, since nobody's even acknowledging my existence, I figure the only explanation is that my IRC client is broken
[16:01:22] <devinrolsen> Ogredude $("#auto_search_customer").attr('name','what value you want');
[16:01:23] <Axsuul> I'm having trouble using the appendTo option for the autocomplete widget in jQuery ui. How can I appendTo the parent element that I'm calling the autocomplete function on? $('.blah').autocomplete({ appendTo: $(this).parent() })  except that doesn't work because "this" doesn't seem to be available
[16:01:25] <devinrolsen> have you tried that?
[16:01:55] <Axsuul> Ogredude: can you repeat the question
[16:02:10] <Axsuul> fellow ruby on railer :)
[16:02:23] <z1000> thanks learn_C but my final code is a bit heavier I can show you if you would like
[16:02:35] <learn_C> z1000 sure
[16:02:41] <Ogredude> okay here's the jfiddle.  I couldn't actually get the darn thing to work in there, at all, though.  http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/
[16:02:59] <Ogredude> I've got an autocomplete text field, and when I select something, it blanks out the textfield instead of putting a value in it.
[16:03:32] <Ogredude> I've even tried to set the value on the textfield directly with $("#auto_search_customer").val("This thing"); in the autocomplete's select event, and it still blanks it out
[16:03:37] <learn_C> Ogredude can you cut all but one?
[16:03:43] <velts> i am currently checking a text input on keyup, but if a browser has that field remeber and a user starts typing it auto suggest and the user click on the auto suggestion what should I be checking on?
[16:03:49] <Ogredude> learn_C:  all but one what?
[16:04:33] <learn_C> Ogredude choose one field to autocomplete
[16:04:50] <Ogredude> umm, hang on
[16:05:25] <Ogredude> learn_C:  there's only one field wired up with autocomplete
[16:05:57] <devinrolsen> velts try keeping your keyup event, but now also make one for onchange.
[16:06:00] <devinrolsen> might be the key.
[16:06:31] <velts> k trying
[16:06:35] <Ogredude> http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/1/ <-- I updated the fiddle, a lot of those fields were supposed to be hidden.
[16:07:02] <Ogredude> I don't have the foggiest idea how to make the autocomplete actually *work* in jsfiddle, though
[16:07:12] <velts> is there a sweeet jquery way to do a keyup and change at the same time?
[16:07:46] <devinrolsen> velts bind()
[16:07:52] <devinrolsen> you can specify more than one event type
[16:08:01] <devinrolsen> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[16:09:37] <devinrolsen> and velts sorry it is not onchange but rather just change
[16:09:39] <devinrolsen> so keyup change
[16:10:53] <Ogredude> bah
[16:11:08] <Ogredude> even when I completely remove the focus and select events, it still blanks out the textfield
[16:17:18] <learn_C> Ogredude you can get json from object using json request
[16:18:02] <Ogredude> learn_C:  eh? The JSON is coming back from Rails just fine. The autocomplete shows the dropdown list with the appropriate search results.
[16:18:05] <Ogredude> All that stuff is good.
[16:18:21] <Ogredude> When I select something, the textfield goes blank.
[16:18:24] <Ogredude> no matter what.
[16:19:05] <Ogredude> I have tried self.val(ui.item.first_name), I've tried self.val("static string"), I've tried $("#auto_search_customer").val("static string")
[16:19:20] <learn_C> Ogredude i am talking about jsfiddle
[16:20:16] <Ogredude> learn_C:  I'm past caring about jsfiddle.  I've been stuck at the same point for the last two hours.
[16:20:32] <Ogredude> I cannot figure out how to get autocomplete to NOT BLANK OUT THE FIELD when I select something
[16:20:45] <Ogredude> I can't see that I'm doing anything wrong
[16:20:59] <Ogredude> I'm looking at the code from another of my projects where I'm doing virtually the same damn autocomplete.
[16:21:05] <Ogredude> that one works. This one doesn't.
[16:22:02] <Ogredude> it is very simple. You type text in the field. It shows a list of stuff. You pick one. It puts that value into the text field.
[16:22:03] <learn_C> Ogredude  but i tried to inser something in Name field
[16:22:05] <Ogredude> that's all I damn well want
[16:22:41] <Ogredude> learn_C:  yeah, I can $("#auto_search_customer").val("This thing") from the chrome dev console and it works just fine
[16:22:55] <Ogredude> if I put $("#auto_search_customer").val("This thing") in the autocomplete's select event, it does not work.
[16:23:44] <Ogredude> I have pared the autocomplete back to .autocomplete({source: self.attr('data-endpoint')})
[16:23:57] <Ogredude> and it still just blanks out the field.
[16:24:02] <learn_C> Ogredude  ....
[16:24:13] <learn_C> Ogredude GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/JcZec/show/%5Bobject%20Object%5D,%5Bobject%20Object%5D,%5Bobject%20Object%5D,%5Bobject%20Object%5D,%5Bobject%20Object%5D,%5Bobject%20Object%5D?term=N 404 135ms
[16:24:42] <learn_C> Ogredude that what happened when i tried to put a text into Name
[16:24:43] <Ogredude> yeah I saw that in the console, I'm assuming it's got somethign to do with the fact that the autocomplete does not work in jsfiddle
[16:25:05] <learn_C> Ogredude  omg....
[16:25:09] <Ogredude> so screw the jsfiddle, treat it as a pastebin
[16:25:19] <learn_C> Ogredude its just a sandbox
[16:26:07] <learn_C> Ogredude you cant do requests because you write only client side
[16:26:26] * Ogredude headdesks
[16:26:29] <Ogredude> dude.
[16:26:32] <Ogredude> listen to me.
[16:26:39] <Ogredude> the searching and the dropdown list of options.
[16:26:47] <Ogredude> it works PERFECTLY on my app.  THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM.
[16:27:03] <Ogredude> the problem is that the textfield goes blank instead of getting assigned a value
[16:28:04] <learn_C> Ogredude dude, how can i help you if you have not prepared an example?
[16:28:13] <Ogredude> fuck it
[16:28:17] <Ogredude> this ain't worth it
[16:28:26] <learn_C> Ogredude relax
[16:28:29] <Ogredude> thanks for trying learn_C but this is no good
[16:28:32] <Ogredude> dude
[16:28:44] <Ogredude> how can I prepare an example WHEN I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET THE THING TO WORK IN JSFIDDLE
[16:28:48] <Ogredude> as I have said multiple times
[16:29:10] <learn_C> Ogredude i told you jsfiddle can do a server job
[16:29:22] <Ogredude> sure, but I don't have a server for it to connect to
[16:29:23] <Ogredude> I'
[16:29:35] <Ogredude> I'm in the rails development environment, the only place the server exists is localhost:3000
[16:29:39] <learn_C> Ogredude you can emulate it jst with "let the object be a json like i got it with a request"
[16:29:49] <Ogredude> I tried to put a sample of the JSON in there as theSource
[16:30:03] <learn_C> Ogredude i saw =)
[16:30:03] <Ogredude> but I DON'T KNOW JAVASCRIPT VERY WELL AND THAT IS WHY I NEED HELP!!!
[16:30:22] <Ogredude> okay this is doing neither of us any good.
[16:30:23] <snover> so much yelling.
[16:30:26] <Ogredude> I'll be back in 5 minutes.
[16:30:30] <Ogredude> snover:  yeah, so much frustration.
[16:30:39] <Ogredude> I've been stuck on this for 2 hours.
[16:36:52] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7451279/does-creating-functions-consume-more-memory
[16:39:24] <Ogredude> okay
[16:39:28] <Ogredude> let's start over
[16:40:36] <Ogredude> learn_C:  can you tell me if theSource in that fiddle is a valid piece of JSON that can be used as the source of the autocomplete?
[16:40:48] <learn_C> Ogredude sure
[16:41:23] <ngharo> Ogredude: http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/2/
[16:41:34] <learn_C> Ogredude you just need not to make a equest to get it. just a=theSource;
[16:41:35] <ngharo> im just jumped in so i have no idea what you're trying to do yet
[16:42:07] <Ogredude> updated fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/3/ still doesn't work
[16:42:29] <t4nk073> has anyone used Jeditable? I'd like to be able for a user to edit his/her password.  Of course I'd like them to provide their original password as verification too - so I need to present two fields instead of just the standard one.  Anyone have any ideas?
[16:42:48] <Ogredude> ngharo:  well since apparently the prerequisite to getting it working on my local machine is to get it working on jsfiddle, I'm currently attempting to get it working in jsfiddle
[16:43:47] <ngharo> my link at least has the autocomplete working
[16:44:23] <ngharo> well kinda; i've never used autocomplete but typing 'c' brings up some options
[16:44:57] <Ogredude> 'c' is the only thing that appears to bring up any options'
[16:45:22] <Ogredude> but at least it demonstrates the issue
[16:45:32] <snover> ?minimal @ Ogredude
[16:45:32] <bot-t> Ogredude, A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[16:46:11] <ngharo> i minimized his fiddle
[16:46:39] <Ogredude> http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/2/ <-- use 'c' as the search term
[16:46:47] <Ogredude> when you select something, the textfield blanks out.
[16:47:07] <Ogredude> that is the issue.
[16:50:36] <Ogredude> okay, minimal. http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/4/
[16:50:46] <Ogredude> that's as much as I can take out of there and still get any sort of behavior out of it
[16:50:54] <Ogredude> and it still exhibits the undesired behavior
[16:52:46] <Ogredude> found it.
[16:53:05] <Ogredude> okay, what is the purpose of return false; at the end of the events, and why does not having it stop things from working?
[16:53:59] <t4nk073> Anyone used Jeditable? It's great - click on a word and you can edit it, and then save to a database.  I want to edit a passowrd, but instead of the usual one field to edit, I want two fields to show up - one for the original password and the second for the new password.  Any ideas how to do it?
[16:54:29] <Ogredude> http://jsfiddle.net/JcZec/5/ <-- working with return false;
[16:54:37] <Ogredude> but WHY
[16:56:07] <ProLoser|Work> harro
[16:56:10] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use templates?
[16:56:14] <learn_C> Ogredude gj =)
[16:56:19] <ProLoser|Work> in {{each}} how do i refer to this?
[16:56:26] <ProLoser|Work> the current value i mean?
[17:02:21] <Ogredude> I just don't get it
[17:02:28] <Ogredude> most lines require a ; at the end, but some don't.
[17:02:34] <Ogredude> sometimes you have to return false, sometimes you don't.
[17:02:41] <Ogredude> there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to any of it.
[17:03:00] <Spadeski>  hi everyone
[17:03:32] <Ogredude> apparently it's just "whatever javascript decides you need to do", because I certainly can't see any pattern to it
[17:03:54] <Ogredude> so I guess from now on, my troubleshooting will involve throwing random semicolons and `return false`s around
[17:04:16] <ngharo> semi colons are always recommended
[17:04:58] <ngharo> the return false probably prevents autocomplete from completing the field with data (because you have a non-value list based source, and setting the value yourself)
[17:05:17] <Ogredude> learn_C:  thanks for the effort, it's greatly appreciated.
[17:05:43] <Ogredude> gnite folks
[17:06:53] <ngharo> gnite sweet prince

[17:25:17] <imsky> hmmm
[17:26:59] <Ziggy`> I have about 5,000 items which I need to display a tree of, I'd like to be able to display only parts/load parts, but this is all hierarchical, so I've not found a solution for paginating, or displaying partials.. Anyone got any suggestions for this? Loading up and showing the whole list takes quite a time.
[17:27:24] <Ziggy`> Btw, this is all displayed inside a table, multiple options..
[17:28:33] <imsky> sounds like a bunch of work
[17:58:44] <gnarf> Ziggy`:  sounds like a grid
[17:59:35] <xenyz> eh is there a slider like nivo slider that I can change the width of on the fly? Nivo Slider works on the image size but I want to scale it up/down
[18:05:44] <Ziggy`> gnarf: Yep, I found jqGrid, but however I find it too fancy.. I want something simplistic.
[18:07:53] <gnarf> Ziggy`: check the UI wiki http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/37927153/Grid-SPF if you don't mind using code that is "in flux" / http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid / then there are osme other grid plugins you might like here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35122722/Grid-OtherGrids
[18:07:57] <astropirate> Do people still use the word web2.0? sounds so 2005-ish
[18:08:34] <gnarf> i don't think "web2.0" is "a word"
[18:08:40] <gnarf> and i never used it
[18:08:45] <gnarf> so who knows if they still do
[18:09:02] <gnarf> the new buzzword/meme is just "HTML5" i think :)
[18:10:51] <astropirate> hah true
[18:11:01] <geekbuntu_> has anyone heard any grumblings/plans etc... about tabs going away in ui? (http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/)
[18:11:07] <geekbuntu_> (in future versions)
[18:11:14] <astropirate> that would suck
[18:11:20] <geekbuntu_> that's kinda what i think
[18:11:25] <geekbuntu_> but i heard someone say something
[18:11:32] <geekbuntu_> wondering if it was known to everyone but me
[18:11:32] <astropirate> we need more widgets not less!
[18:11:46] <geekbuntu_> yea but there are some peeps in the know in here
[18:11:52] <geekbuntu_> maybe somebody 'KNOWS'?
[18:11:53] <geekbuntu_> o.0
[18:11:57] <astropirate> lol
[18:12:18] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: they lied
[18:12:25] <kborchers> where did you hear that???
[18:12:51] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: we have had no conversations about removing any widgets in any meetings since i joined the UI team months ago
[18:13:26] <gnarf> SOME widgets in 1.9 are getting their functionality "paired down" because the API is getting really bloated
[18:13:40] <gnarf> a lot more things will probably turn into widget mixins instead of builtin functionality
[18:14:04] <geekbuntu_> well, i'm getting pm's and says that accordion is going as well
[18:14:09] <kborchers> astropirate: there are more coming (menu, menubar, popup, tooltip and spinner planned for 1.9)
[18:14:24] <astropirate> kborchers, i know can't wait :D
[18:14:32] <geekbuntu_> what would take it's place?
[18:14:36] <geekbuntu_> it's kind of a main stay
[18:14:39] <geekbuntu_> tabs/accord
[18:14:45] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: still alive and kicking in master - so whatever your "source" is telling you is entirely untrue
[18:15:08] <Spadeski> gnarf is more than correct on this one
[18:15:51] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: you're the first person i've even heard suggest any widget gets removed
[18:16:01] <geekbuntu_> well, this source is reliable
[18:16:05] <astropirate> to the stake with him!
[18:16:12] <geekbuntu_> nah - he's a good egg
[18:16:21] <geekbuntu_> just sucks tho
[18:16:33] <gnarf> bullshit - if we were pulling out a plugin - I'd know
[18:16:41] <kborchers> geekbuntu_: if your source isn't on the team ... how reliable are they
[18:16:55] <gnarf> hell if you want me to pull it out....
[18:16:59] <astropirate> geekbuntu, fire yoru source and then hire me
[18:17:08] <djQuery> gnarf: thought I remembered in the api redesign for 1.9 that tabs was getting rid of the template param
[18:17:13] <gnarf> git rm ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js ; git commit -m "BOOM"; git push
[18:17:27] <gnarf> djQuery: like i said, api is changing
[18:17:27] <kborchers> lol
[18:17:39] <djQuery> and i was his source.
[18:17:43] <geekbuntu_> shhh
[18:17:48] <geekbuntu_> you're name was DEEPTHROAT
[18:17:49] <Spadeski> gnarf do you mind for a PM
[18:17:56] <geekbuntu_> let's talk here
[18:17:57] <geekbuntu_> pls
[18:18:06] <geekbuntu_> i'm working on a project and using this
[18:18:09] <gnarf> why do i feel like we are playing ##wolfgame :)
[18:18:11] <geekbuntu_> would really like to know if i need to change
[18:18:20] <astropirate> they are talking about naughty things
[18:18:23] * geekbuntu_ slides gnarf the magic key
[18:18:27] <Spadeski> alright I was wondering if you had any ideas for http://209.172.30.123/WWWRoot/?gp=home
[18:18:29] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: the public facing APIs are changing by 2.0
[18:18:37] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: but 1.9 should be fully backCompat
[18:18:40] <Spadeski> My home Dialup server Test server - real on is HS
[18:19:00] <geekbuntu_> why would they remove these two widgets?
[18:19:05] <geekbuntu_> (well, 1 with a twist)
[18:19:10] <gnarf> they are not removing widgets at all
[18:19:21] <geekbuntu_> in version 2.0
[18:19:23] <gnarf> they are removing options that bloat the API and make more sense as plugins on top
[18:19:41] <geekbuntu_> so the widgets may (MAY) be available but as plugins?
[18:19:43] <gnarf> i.e. if you want a "template" option, you include the jquery.ui.tabs.templates.js
[18:19:45] <geekbuntu_> keep the core more CORE?
[18:19:46] <astropirate> plugins for a plugin? :D this should be intresting
[18:20:05] <gnarf> its already done for some things
[18:20:16] * geekbuntu_ i think i hear astropirates crew hollering for him? :-D
[18:20:27] <gnarf> like the ability for autocomplete to use html sources
[18:20:35] <gnarf> instead of just "name"
[18:20:39] <geekbuntu_> would you recommend not using it for anything long term?
[18:21:03] <kborchers> i'm doing it for menu right now ... inputs (radio, checkbox, text) as menu items will be an extension of menu, not part of menu widget
[18:21:13] <gnarf> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/08/extensible-autocomplete/
[18:21:18] <gnarf> astropirate: ^^^
[18:22:05] <djQuery> here is the jqueryui blog post that mentions template being removed from tabs.
[18:22:06] <djQuery> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/tabs-api-redesign/
[18:22:07] <gnarf> you can mixin functionality to the widgets
[18:22:09] <geekbuntu_> most of the time, changes end up being good but for peons like me that have to know/work in several languages - it's rough to keep up to speed
[18:22:14] <geekbuntu_> and think about retro fitting
[18:22:38] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: don't fear 1.9
[18:22:58] * geekbuntu_ (i'm not hugging it yet)
[18:23:11] <gnarf> djQuery: and in the first paragraph they say exactly what i just did:
[18:23:16] <gnarf> jQuery UI Tabs in 1.9 will support the 1.8 API as well, and the deprecated APIs will not be removed until jQuery UI 2.0.
[18:23:30] <gnarf> its even in bold
[18:23:35] <gnarf> now stop spreading your fear
[18:23:35] <djQuery> k
[18:23:48] <geekbuntu_> in reality, if 2.0 came out and we had tabs/accord's implemented - what would it mean?
[18:23:52] <geekbuntu_> keep using old jquery?
[18:23:56] <geekbuntu_> 1,.9
[18:24:04] <gnarf> ?fud @djQuery
[18:24:04] <bot-t> djQuery, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt
[18:24:05] <geekbuntu_> or is that unknwon
[18:24:47] <djQuery> geekbuntu_: it would just mean that you would need to manualy add the li for the tab then call .tabs('refresh') on the ul
[18:24:47] <gnarf> geekbuntu_: stay on 1.9 until you upgrade your code
[18:24:49] <gnarf> to match
[18:25:07] <geekbuntu_> that's it?
[18:25:09] <gnarf> or mixin your own backward compatable ways of doing it to your widget
[18:25:35] <geekbuntu_> that's hot hellish
[18:25:38] <geekbuntu_> that's NOT
[18:25:41] <geekbuntu_> hellish
[18:25:50] <geekbuntu_> just removing a shortcut
[18:26:12] <gnarf> "By spreading questionable information about the drawbacks of less well known products, an established company can discourage decision-makers from choosing those products over its own, regardless of the relative technical merits"
[18:26:26] <geekbuntu_> looks like load is on the chopping block
[18:26:30] <geekbuntu_> can't imagine why
[18:26:39] <geekbuntu_> unless it's just time to retire
[18:26:53] <imsky> GEEKBUNTU

[18:27:49] <astropirate> yes
[18:27:53] <geekbuntu_> i had to use your wiggle plugin, but i had to scale it back to more of a jiggle

[18:29:05] <astropirate> x files?
[18:29:13] * geekbuntu_ *pulls on ear to let gnarf know it's an authenticated message*

[18:48:37] <geekbuntu> oh imsky you're killing me man
[18:48:50] <imsky> oh ye?
[18:48:52] <imsky> why
[18:49:10] <geekbuntu> only heard about a few of those things
[18:49:17] <geekbuntu> will be good to see them being used
[18:49:25] <imsky> lol what do you use jquery for man
[18:50:29] <geekbuntu> i actually just started using it about 4 - 5 months ago
[18:50:29] <foxhoundz> how do I break from an .each() loop and return at the same time?
[18:50:40] <foxhoundz> return from a function that is
[18:51:30] <geekbuntu> foxhoundz, return false?
[18:51:35] <srj55> is it better to use ajax() instead of getJSON() since you can use error handling for ajax()?  Right now I'm using getJSON, but if there are any errors, the javascript stops and doesn't recover from this error
[18:51:37] <imsky> or JUST RETURN
[18:52:07] <geekbuntu> return will work, but has to finisih the loop - return false stops it immediately
[18:52:16] <imsky> you are a genius
[18:52:17] <foxhoundz> ahh
[18:52:21] <imsky> i should have never doubted you
[18:52:31] * geekbuntu pulls out the jello
[18:52:34] * geekbuntu o.0
[18:52:34] <imsky> hahaha
[18:52:35] * imsky wiggles
[18:52:47] <geekbuntu> i know djQuery  is throwing up by now
[18:53:03] <dumbledore> when I hide an input field it doesn't get shown when it's its turn in the tabindex (or has been removed from the tab index?), how can I include it in the tabbing(TAB)? (show and select on its turn)
[18:54:37] <foxhoundz> geekbuntu: This is what I'm talking about: http://pastie.org/2545963
[18:54:43] <foxhoundz> returning false breaks the loop
[18:54:54] <foxhoundz> but I also want it return from its parent function
[18:55:16] <foxhoundz> I have other code in process()
[18:56:23] <geekbuntu> foxhoundz, it would be easier to test it if it was in fiddle :)
[18:56:36] <geekbuntu> jsfiddle.net i think it is
[18:56:39] <foxhoundz> I know
[18:58:01] <foxhoundz> jsFiddle doesn't jive well with Firefox 6
[18:58:12] <foxhoundz> I was just hoping for an explaination on how I would go about it
[19:01:32] <geekbuntu> foxhoundz, man are you sure you shouldn't be returning true?
[19:01:46] <geekbuntu> i just read a page on autocomplete - it shows it returning true when the result is found
[19:01:55] <geekbuntu> i gotta work a little bit - bbiab
[19:02:42] <imsky> later man
[19:03:43] <dumbledore> how do you include hidden fields in the process of tabbing between elements? (show and select it when you press tab from the element next to it)
[19:03:52] <imsky> you cant
[19:03:55] <imsky> that's crazy talk
[19:05:07] <dumbledore> wait, can't you just detect the key pressed and the element selected when it's pressed and if it is a certain combination: show and select X?
[19:11:34] <vasa> hello hear me?
[19:12:17] <vasa> is it ok to ask questions about mysql databases here?
[19:12:29] <vasa> and php
[19:12:32] <snover> no
[19:12:36] <vasa> okay
[19:16:24] <Spadeski> vasa if they help us understand your jquery problem you may
[19:16:43] <srj55> whenever I use $.ajax()  with an error callback handler in Chrome, any errors are not 'caught' and then all javascript stops running...anyone have any idea why?
[19:17:28] <sanduz2> i have a few functions running at intervals and when i view another tab and come back all the functions run many times very fast (as if it were catching up). is there any way to pause these intervaled functions while the user is not viewing the window?
[19:17:36] <sanduz2> or changes tabs better yet
[19:18:00] <Jack80> Could please someone take a look at this in Chrome and tell me why the animation performance is so poor? http://jsbin.com/ehahoc/7/
[19:48:35] <streek> Anyone know why my 304 Not Modified is hitting .ajax failure: ?
[19:50:24] <tbranyen> streek: nope thats p f'd up
[19:51:19] <streek>  damn, I can't figure it out at all.  :(
[19:55:35] <geekbuntu> imsky - you still here?
[19:55:41] <imsky> yeah man
[19:55:47] <geekbuntu> pm me a link
[19:55:48] <imsky> high on redbull haha
[19:55:51] <geekbuntu> i gotta see
[19:55:52] <imsky> any link?
[19:55:53] <geekbuntu> :-D
[19:55:59] <geekbuntu> strippers?
[19:56:00] <geekbuntu> wiggling?
[19:56:05] <geekbuntu> no man your css/cms
[19:57:14] <imsky> oh man
[19:57:16] <imsky> funny story
[19:57:23] <imsky> i've been chatting to 2 people for the last like hour and a half
[19:57:25] <imsky> no further development
[19:57:29] <geekbuntu> omg
[19:57:39] <geekbuntu> imsky - man - redbull juice is not to be wasted!
[19:57:53] <imsky> you are correct
[19:58:20] <geekbuntu> i think i shoulda skipped this last 15 mg
[19:58:21] <geekbuntu> omg
[19:58:32] <geekbuntu> i'm pretty sure i can feel the hairs on my back doing the wave
[19:58:40] <geekbuntu> and i don't have ahir on my back
[19:58:42] <geekbuntu> o.0
[19:58:46] <fructose> Why would form.find('input,select,textarea') return nothing and form.get(0).elements return a host of select, input, and textarea elements?
[19:58:56] <imsky> geekbuntu's hairs doing the wiggle
[19:59:01] <geekbuntu> yep
[19:59:25] <geekbuntu> fructose, since it's just a guess... it could be because it's a json object?
[19:59:42] <tbranyen> fructose: you sure its not returning anything???
[20:00:01] <tbranyen> console.log(form.find('input,select,textarea').length)
[20:00:30] <fructose> tbranyen: Unless Firebug is lying, then yes, I'm sure
[20:00:44] <geekbuntu> it almost looks like it is wrapped in a json object if zero (0) is removing the outter /exposing the form object
[20:01:23] <fructose> form = jQuery('#' + formID);
[20:01:27] <tbranyen> fructose: can you make a jsfiddle?
[20:01:52] <geekbuntu> a fiddle is a good idea
[20:01:55] <geekbuntu> even for your own sanity
[20:02:08] <geekbuntu> makes it clear what you're tryihng to do
[20:02:35] <geekbuntu> (it's a PITA tho)
[20:02:46] <fructose> Well, could it be due to malformatted HTML?
[20:02:51] <booboonathan> Does anyone here wanna earn themselves $10?
[20:02:55] <imsky> yeah sure
[20:03:41] <geekbuntu> does it involve jello?
[20:03:44] <geekbuntu> webcame?
[20:03:47] <geekbuntu> webcam
[20:03:48] <imsky> i'll double my fee!
[20:03:48] <geekbuntu> wiggling?
[20:03:51] <geekbuntu> o.0
[20:03:59] <geekbuntu> dumbledore ran
[20:04:05] <geekbuntu> smart
[20:04:07] <booboonathan> I basically need a script that when you hover over an image, it changed the image to another one, however the twist is depending where you hover is what image shows up
[20:04:10] <booboonathan> lolz
[20:04:28] <streek> booboonathan: image maps?
[20:04:40] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, you don't want to search for a plugin?
[20:04:44] <booboonathan> noo
[20:04:45] <geekbuntu> sounds pretty generic
[20:04:56] <streek> Super simple really.
[20:05:18] <geekbuntu> man i need to wave a $10 bill the next time i need help
[20:05:25] <geekbuntu> all the geeks are rolling up their pants leg
[20:05:35] <booboonathan> basically, i could have a list of images (that are hidden) and if I have 2 images in this list then if i hover on left side it will be the one image or if i hover on the other side then it will be the other image, but this can escalate if i throw in 40 images
[20:06:09] <booboonathan> so it calculates the size of the image, divides it by the number of images in the list, and then determines the hidden 'columns' on which when i hover the mouse in is when it changes the image
[20:06:11] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, you've explained it pretty well, but are these images going to be hard coded?
[20:06:19] <geekbuntu> or does the script need to grep the folder
[20:06:24] <geekbuntu> build it's own array of images?
[20:06:35] <fructose> I'd charge somewhere in the $500 range
[20:06:38] <geekbuntu> i don't plan on doing it - just clarifying it for whoever jumps
[20:06:45] <geekbuntu> so there isn't a fight
[20:06:46] <geekbuntu> :)
[20:06:59] <booboonathan> hardcoded
[20:07:05] <booboonathan> because it would be ran through a php script
[20:07:19] <geekbuntu> honestly 30 is fair
[20:07:29] <geekbuntu> it's about 40 mins work for a good coder
[20:07:49] <fructose> It's been 5 minutes already
[20:07:49] <booboonathan> yeah so 30 is ridiculous
[20:07:57] <booboonathan> I'm a student bah
[20:08:00] <geekbuntu> ah
[20:08:01] <booboonathan> i don't have that sort of money
[20:08:08] <geekbuntu> we're alcoholics
[20:08:10] <imsky> haha omg
[20:08:10] <geekbuntu> we don't either
[20:08:12] <booboonathan> hahaha
[20:08:18] <imsky> MINIMUM RATE IS $250 THANK YOU
[20:08:25] <booboonathan> do you have a drink next to you geekbuntu?
[20:08:25] <fructose> Damn, I should start outsourcing to you guys
[20:08:34] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, if you had 250 - imsky is worth it
[20:08:37] <imsky> i have a drink next to me!
[20:08:43] <geekbuntu> i got diet pepsi
[20:08:48] <geekbuntu> and a 3 month supply of adderall
[20:08:50] <geekbuntu> in a keg
[20:08:51] <imsky> hahahaha
[20:08:58] <imsky> greg you are gonna murder yourself
[20:09:01] <imsky> with joy
[20:09:05] <fructose> geekbuntu: You made me thirsty. Thanks a lot
[20:09:09] <geekbuntu> o.0o
[20:09:09] <booboonathan> well then, your not an alcoholic because alcoholics need a drink, and you already have one ;)
[20:09:11] <geekbuntu> not my fault
[20:09:18] <geekbuntu> i was just joking :)
[20:09:28] <geekbuntu> i'm having an imsky night
[20:09:32] <geekbuntu> i'm all wound up and still can't focus
[20:09:41] <imsky> hahahaha
[20:09:54] <PhonicUK> css question - i have an element that is position:absolute with left:200px, how can i make its width fill up the remaining space in its container?
[20:10:10] <geekbuntu> booboonathan,
[20:10:12] <geekbuntu> stick around
[20:10:35] <booboonathan> geekbunto, will do, why?
[20:10:46] <geekbuntu> wanted to read your prereqs again
[20:10:54] <geekbuntu> you need jquery pagination
[20:10:58] <geekbuntu> and just use images
[20:10:58] <fructose> booboonathan: If you were clever, you'd offer a $10 game on Steam instead of just $10
[20:11:08] <geekbuntu> that's actually a good idea
[20:11:11] <geekbuntu> a gc for steam
[20:11:12] <imsky> that is a good idea
[20:11:17] <geekbuntu> many new games are coming out soon
[20:11:22] <PhonicUK> nm, got it
[20:11:25] <booboonathan> fine, a gc for steam of $10
[20:11:29] <booboonathan> whatever floats your boat!
[20:11:31] <imsky> ahahahaa
[20:11:35] <imsky> CAPITALISM BABY YEAH
[20:11:38] <sanduz2> i have an interval running some functions, when i view another tab and come back, the interval seems to have queued all the functions and then runs them all at once (as if to catch up) when i return to the tab. any ideas on how to fix this? perhaps something to pause the interval if the tab isnt being viewed?
[20:11:51] <booboonathan> but why would jquery pagination do it geekbunto?
[20:11:53] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, there is a plugin called gallerific that does exactly what you need
[20:11:57] <booboonathan> oooo
[20:11:59] <booboonathan> lemme check
[20:12:01] <geekbuntu> because you have 40 images
[20:12:03] <geekbuntu> hidden
[20:12:08] <geekbuntu> only shows in groups
[20:12:15] <geekbuntu> it's hardcoded
[20:12:17] <geekbuntu> and easy to setup
[20:12:32] * geekbuntu everybody hide - coldhead is here
[20:12:46] * coldhead smiles politely
[20:12:49] <booboonathan> Ah geekbunto
[20:12:53] <booboonathan> I think you have the wrong end of the stick
[20:13:14] <geekbuntu> let's not talk about grabbing sticks
[20:13:22] * geekbuntu (hostile environment)
[20:13:25] <booboonathan> I mean one image no other thumbnails, and then you can just swipe your cursor across it and it will quickly change that same image to another different one
[20:13:29] <booboonathan> lawl
[20:13:37] <booboonathan> if that makes more sense?
[20:13:40] <geekbuntu> yes
[20:13:43] <geekbuntu> iphone gallery
[20:13:52] <booboonathan> iPhone gallery?
[20:14:29] <geekbuntu> http://www.netcu.de/jquery-touchwipe-iphone-ipad-library
[20:14:46] <geekbuntu> exactly what you just said
[20:14:47] <geekbuntu> :-D
[20:15:38] <booboonathan> Basically there would be a thumbnail for a photo album, and then hovering over the image, depending on the 'zone' it would change that same thumbnail image to something else, its to see the overview of the album before you click it sort of thing
[20:16:53] <booboonathan> for anyone that does it, gets a $10 steam GC
[20:17:03] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, http://cssglobe.com/lab/tooltip/02/
[20:17:14] <booboonathan> nope
[20:17:17] <geekbuntu> haha
[20:17:22] <geekbuntu> i was trying to save you money
[20:17:31] <booboonathan> haha
[20:17:34] <booboonathan> mind games!
[20:17:47] <geekbuntu> i figured if i found you a plugin - it would save you some grief
[20:17:49] <geekbuntu> and money
[20:17:56] <booboonathan> if you can that would be amazing
[20:18:01] <booboonathan> but i have looked i think
[20:18:09] <booboonathan> but i can't think of what the plugin could be called
[20:18:38] <geekbuntu> what you describe sounds close to several things
[20:19:13] <geekbuntu> ok i'm gonna code a little bit (hopefully)
[20:19:21] <geekbuntu> imsky - get busy and pm me a link man! :-D
[20:19:32] <imsky> oh shit
[20:19:33] <imsky> yeah man
[20:19:36] <imsky> maybe not tonight
[20:19:40] <geekbuntu> lol
[20:19:41] <imsky> also it's an admin console
[20:19:48] <imsky> so kinda meant for my own use
[20:19:51] <booboonathan> geekbuntu, its not coding related to what i want is it? :P
[20:19:52] <imsky> but i might opensource it!!!
[20:19:52] <geekbuntu> when that redbull wears off you're gonna be out
[20:20:07] <geekbuntu> let me know if you want help with backend - will help if you want it
[20:20:25] <geekbuntu> booboonathan, this late i have to stay close to my comfort range :)
[20:20:36] <imsky> i'm using redbean, geekbuntu
[20:20:36] <booboonathan> haha
[20:20:42] <imsky> it's a "no-help-requred" thing
[20:20:44] <geekbuntu> redbean
[20:20:47] <geekbuntu> ah
[20:21:42] <oojacoboo> can I do a crossDomain .ajax() function against an xml dataType?
[20:23:44] <geekbuntu> imsky - redbean smells like java (by looking at api)
[20:24:05] <geekbuntu> it uses PDO tho - prepared data is the best way to go
[20:24:05] <imsky> R::dispense("thing")::store(); is java?
[20:24:15] <geekbuntu> it's class instantiation
[20:24:19] <imsky> bro
[20:24:24] <geekbuntu> but the api logic reads like java
[20:24:26] <imsky> i do not care what it smells like
[20:24:36] <imsky> i care that i dont have to type 50 prepared statements
[20:24:39] <oojacoboo> looks like ruby to me
[20:24:41] <geekbuntu> i'm not complaining
[20:24:42] <geekbuntu> :-D
[20:24:43] <imsky> hahah :D
[20:24:47] <geekbuntu> PDO is a good clue
[20:25:00] <imsky> yeah i think all of the major ORMs run on PDO
[20:25:05] <geekbuntu> if you see mysqli with prepared statement or pdo - you're prolly good to go
[20:25:12] <geekbuntu> well, doctrine is making a huge play
[20:25:18] <geekbuntu> big powerful orm
[20:25:24] <imsky> yep
[20:25:24] <Genesis730> I want to do an animation on a specific class, I have the class in a variable but I can't see how to put them together?? I thought $("#spanID").animate({  where spanID  is a the variable name... I have done alert(spanID) and it is returning the correct class name...
[20:25:27] <imsky> already researched that
[20:25:31] <imsky> doctrine is pdo too
[20:25:35] <geekbuntu> yep
[20:25:40] <imsky> and way too heavy
[20:25:46] <imsky> plus it's got yaml or whatever
[20:25:52] <geekbuntu> i'm actually going to use just plain php/pdo with oracle for this next project
[20:26:07] <geekbuntu> ppl clink to yaml for google apps
[20:26:11] <geekbuntu> makes deploying easy
[20:26:18] <imsky> PDO SALUTE, SOLDIER
[20:26:31] * geekbuntu *does the benny hill salue*
[20:26:33] <geekbuntu> salute
[20:27:31] <imsky> jhahaha
[20:27:32] <imsky> wat
[20:27:39] <imsky> hmm

[20:28:23] <sanduz2> is there a way to check if the tab in question is being viewed? for example, something like: is tab in focus True or False
[20:28:32] <imsky> OH SHIT BENNY HILL
[20:28:35] <imsky> you happy looking fucker
[20:28:40] <geekbuntu> :)

[20:31:29] <micro__> hi guys...  i can't figure out how to select all visited links with jquery
[20:31:46] <imsky> pfft
[20:31:50] <imsky> $("a:visited")
[20:31:52] <imsky> i think
[20:31:54] <imsky> ahahah

[20:32:04] <micro__> t for me
[20:32:07] <imsky> yeah i guess it doesn't
[20:32:09] <imsky> haha i'm sorry

[20:33:05] <imsky> yea you're right
[20:33:19] <micro__> i can't understand why something so small is holding up my whole project LOL
[20:33:42] <imsky> tru tru
[20:33:43] <Genesis730> micro__: looks like you can't without a plugin... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1210871/use-jquery-to-select-visited-links
[20:33:53] <imsky> oh wait
[20:33:55] <imsky> yeah you can
[20:33:55] <micro__> Genesis: i was hoping this werent true
[20:33:59] <Genesis730> or using a specific class
[20:34:02] <imsky> micro__: how are visited links different
[20:34:10] <Genesis730> like $("a:visited").parent(".question-summary").addClass("is_visited");
[20:34:11] <micro__> imsky: what dyu mean?
[20:34:17] <imsky> are they a diff color?
[20:34:24] <Genesis730> you CAN color them different
[20:34:25] <micro__> well im hoping to hide them all
[20:34:36] <imsky> micro__: yeah just give them a diff color and test that with jquery
[20:35:10] <micro__> ummm well thats kind of a circular problem see... im using jquery precisely because i cant seem to get to them via css
[20:35:14] <Genesis730> micro__: why not use CSS
[20:35:27] <Genesis730> a:visited { display:none; }
[20:35:32] <imsky> ye ye
[20:35:38] <micro__> Genesis730: hehehe i wish!
[20:35:44] <imsky> wtf you wish?
[20:35:51] <micro__> ive tried all sorts of !important heirarchy tricks
[20:35:51] <Genesis730> that'll hide all visitied links
[20:35:55] <micro__> no clue why i can't
[20:36:11] <imsky> your source is screwed probaly
[20:37:20] <micro__> hmm yea

[20:38:13] <micro__> well that doesnt help at all
[20:38:14] <micro__> lol
[20:38:21] <imsky> it doesn't?

[20:58:37] <piklu> hii
[21:10:14] <booboonathan> does anyone know of a website that I can see if i have any unclosed divs in my code?
[21:10:41] <aca20031> you could validate the html
[21:11:11] <booboonathan> doesn't always work
[21:11:17] <booboonathan> but yeah your right i could
[21:11:19] <booboonathan> and ill try that
[21:11:22] <booboonathan> i forgot about that
[21:11:47] <booboonathan> but i stumbled across a website in which you paste the code and it will then put it in a hierarchy so you can see whats broken and whats not
[21:14:27] <booboonathan> nope validator was useless
[21:28:33] <GomezR> hi, i've been using epihany to test, and with a set of radio inputs, i notice when i change the values with the up/down, the change event isn't triggered. fault of jquery or epiphany?
[22:13:45] <zoggy> which is better to use, $(this).attr("disabled", "disabled") or $(this).attr('disabled', true);
[22:15:45] <acalbaza> hi, does anyone know if it is possible to mock $.ajax({...}) with jsmockito?  i'd like to get this call into a test.
[22:17:14] <zoggy> btw jquery is on 1.6.4 not .3
[22:17:17] <zoggy> plz update topic
[22:22:05] <coldhead> thx zoggy
[22:52:09] <oojacoboo> document.createElement('foo');
[22:52:35] <oojacoboo> foo.what = 'the text inside the html element between the brackets';
[22:53:04] <oojacoboo> or do you have to use html() to do this, trying to put something inside <script></script> tags
[23:11:41] <muzone> So I'm using jQuery Cycle to cycle some hot chicks on hover - http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/nspL3/ - but how do I make the first cycle happen immediately on hover so users won't have to wait around?
[23:14:10] <coldhead> ?trigger
[23:14:11] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[23:14:28] <coldhead> $('thingy').trigger('mouseover'); probably
[23:15:29] <muzone> coldhead: you even bother looking at the code?
[23:17:49] <coldhead> a bit
[23:18:00] <coldhead> but i was disappointed by the "hot chicks"
[23:18:07] <coldhead> then i started reading about x-men
[23:20:04] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/nspL3/1/
[23:20:38] <coldhead> sorry, it's my first day using jQuery
[23:20:43] <oojacoboo> if I want to call a function at the end of another function, do I just callTheFunction(); like that?
[23:21:03] <oojacoboo> or do I need to add something else to it?
[23:21:14] <coldhead> oojacoboo: that should do it
[23:21:25] <oojacoboo> also, if I want to add a delay, can I use callTheFunction().delay(1000);
[23:21:30] <coldhead> if you need to pass the same arguments as those given to the calling function it's trickier
[23:22:00] <coldhead> ?mdc settimeout @ oojacoboo
[23:22:01] <bot-t> oojacoboo, window.setTimeout - MDN - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setTimeout
[23:22:12] <oojacoboo> ohâ€¦ not delay
[23:22:12] <coldhead> setTimeout(callTheFunction, 1000)
[23:22:13] <oojacoboo> ok
[23:22:14] <oojacoboo> yea
[23:22:18] <oojacoboo> got it, thanks
[23:22:45] <oojacoboo> I've taught myself a TON of js in 2 days
[23:22:50] <oojacoboo> pretty impressed :P
[23:23:04] <coldhead> what languages did you already know, oojacoboo?
[23:23:07] <oojacoboo> jquery is actually very easy
[23:23:08] <muzone> coldhead: hehe sorry to disappoint you=)=)
[23:23:20] <oojacoboo> coldhead: I am a html/css/designer/ui guy
[23:23:35] <coldhead> oojacoboo: you're the target audience for jQuery then :)
[23:23:43] <oojacoboo> si
[23:23:45] <coldhead> that's why it uses CSS selectors
[23:23:51] <oojacoboo> I know, I love it :)
[23:24:09] <oojacoboo> I've been looking at jquery for years
[23:24:15] <oojacoboo> just never really had to write much of it
[23:25:10] <coldhead> and now you're unstoppable!
[23:25:12] <coldhead> ?hi5
[23:25:13] <bot-t> âµ
[23:25:20] <oojacoboo> lol
[23:25:23] <oojacoboo> I dunno about that
[23:28:37] <axscode> <img onmouseover="this.src='/sites/default/files/profile/user_hover.png'" onmouseout="this.src='/sites/default/files/profile/user.png'" src="/sites/default/files/profile/user.png" alt="Profile">  <-- whats the correct way of doing this,,  "this.src" seems not working i tried "document.this.src" also seems not working.
[23:38:48] <Spadeski> How do I make images refresh auto with ajax?
[23:42:59] <Fright01> Can anybody help me w/ the newer version of jqueryui? I don't rly understnad which files i need to put where. >>>
[23:43:03] <Fright01> >_>
[23:43:45] <Spadeski> Anyone
[23:51:35] <PoPSiCLe> hey - quick question about a  $.post-function
[23:52:30] <PoPSiCLe> I'm trying to show an alert containing any return values from the processing .php file - hence doing as follows: function(data) { if (data.length != 0) { alert(data) } } - but it shows the alert no matter what, just showing an empty alert box
[23:52:40] <PoPSiCLe> shouldn't this work as intended?
[23:53:23] <sacho> well, log what is in data and find out.
[23:54:49] <PoPSiCLe> console.log(data) or something?
[23:58:21] <coldhead> that should do it!
[23:58:55] <coldhead> axscode: use jQuery, not that old school inline stuff
[23:59:15] <axscode> cool: : really want to do that can u help out a bit
[23:59:27] <coldhead> k
