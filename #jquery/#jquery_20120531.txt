[00:03:17] <wodemaye__> antnash, $('[class*="classNameToSelect"]')
[00:03:51] <wodemaye__> for "containing classNameToSelect"
[00:03:58] <wodemaye__> for "beginning with..."
[00:04:51] <wodemaye__> antnash, $('[class^="joblist"]')
[00:05:15] <wodemaye__> or if you can make the class name prefix 'joblist-', then use:
[00:05:18] <wodemaye__> antnash, $('[class|="joblist"]')
[00:05:27] <wodemaye__> u there, antnash ?
[00:06:03] <antnash> Sorry dud
[00:06:04] <antnash> e
[00:06:09] <antnash> Just back
[00:06:12] <wodemaye__> antnash, for what exactly?
[00:06:48] <wodemaye__> what did the world do before jquery.  vanilla js devs are srsly such losers.
[00:06:59] <antnash> Haha! So true!
[00:07:00] <wodemaye__> antnash, but yeah, give those two a try.
[00:07:07] <wodemaye__> err, three.
[00:07:26] <wodemaye__> check out api.jquery.com/category/selectors
[00:07:35] <antnash> So you reckon do $(this).parent('[class^=joblist']') ?
[00:08:46] <wodemaye__> well wait... no. i'd use *= since joblist isn't necessarily going to be the first class listed.
[00:09:05] <antnash> good point
[00:09:15] <antnash> and more than likely it's not
[00:09:31] <wodemaye__> if you have <ol class="maincontent joblist"> than ^= ain't gonna match it.
[00:09:37] <antnash> But I think I'm barking up the wrong tree with using classes
[00:09:47] <antnash> I think I need to use data
[00:10:16] <wodemaye__> perhaps.  depends if u need to get at the class from css or not.
[00:10:39] <antnash> nope, this is for js stuff
[00:10:39] <wodemaye__> if that's all u're using data for then you could probably do:
[00:11:00] <wodemaye__> $('[data^="joblist"]')
[00:11:11] <wodemaye__> i don't really know anything about the data attr though - what's it for?
[00:11:40] <MrTool> Good Morning, i had a question with my following code http://jsfiddle.net/XxWYs/5/ how can i interupt the for as long as it takes to visualy update the Number, like an Increment Counter "Loaded x from y"
[00:11:52] <runvnc> I thought it was like data-myinfo="myspecial data"
[00:12:04] <runvnc> with a hyphen and then something else after the word data
[00:12:10] <antnash> well you can set data on an element with .data('element', 'key', 'value'), and retrieve with .data('key', 'value')
[00:12:18] <runvnc> so that you wouldnt have to use like classes
[00:12:25] <runvnc> if you are talking about html5 data attribute
[00:12:27] <runvnc> data-
[00:12:39] <antnash> yeah, that's my understanding too runvnc. Or part of it
[00:12:52] <runvnc> but I think that jquery .data is similar but different
[00:13:03] <runvnc> different way to do basically the same thing
[00:13:53] <antnash> I think jquery can access data-key="value" as I described above.
[00:13:56] <wodemaye__> runvnc, is it bad practice to use @class for things that are behavior and not presentation related?
[00:14:18] <runvnc> no
[00:14:26] <runvnc> behavior seems like presentation to me
[00:14:39] <runvnc> but you could consider .data or the data-blah html5 thing maybe for some stuff
[00:14:43] <wodemaye__> not necessarily, runvnc.
[00:15:10] <runvnc> I dont see it as a big deal to use classes for lots of stuff.. just slightly better to use .data or data- for some things
[00:15:31] <wodemaye__> runvnc, like what kinds of things?
[00:15:51] <runvnc> maybe things that you were only using class for because you didn't know about .data or there was no data-
[00:17:16] <wodemaye__> what is data supposed to be for?
[00:17:35] <runvnc> http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[00:18:09] <runvnc> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[00:18:43] <runvnc> I have used .data to store a widget name.. instead of  putting it in name
[00:18:54] <runvnc> actually I put a whole bunch of stuff in there a whole object
[00:18:58] <runvnc> all the code for the widget
[00:19:24] <runvnc> jquery .data seems more useful that way except you can't persist the object
[00:19:29] <runvnc> the way data-blah attributes are
[00:22:35] <SH0CKED> Hi everyone, i'm trying to animate a lot of elements inside my div to increase the overall size. I'm wondering what the quickest (least code) way would be to multiply their width for instance
[00:22:51] <SH0CKED> *using animate
[00:23:16] <runvnc> give all of the elements the same class
[00:23:54] <SH0CKED> they have classes right now
[00:24:45] <wodemaye__> gf3, u there?
[00:25:45] <runvnc> add another class that they share in common
[00:25:55] <runvnc> $('.shitIwanttomoveallatonce').animate
[00:26:10] <SH0CKED> alright :)
[00:26:17] <runvnc> class="ball shitiwanttomove"  .... class="bang shitIwanttomove"
[00:34:54] <MrTool> Good Morning, i had a question with my following code http://jsfiddle.net/XxWYs/5/ how can i interupt the for as long as it takes to visualy update the Number, like an Increment Counter "Loaded x from y"
[00:37:04] <vlad_> guys i want to ask again, i have a webapp in which i draw list of products with php
[00:37:23] <vlad_> then i need to alter the info of those products like quantity and price
[00:37:42] <vlad_> i use jquery for that in a rude way i think and very direct
[00:37:50] <vlad_> 			selectedPrice = parseInt($this.find("h2").text().replace(/[^\d.,]+/,''),10); // put the price of the product in selectedPrice and convert to integer 			selectedName = $this.find("h1").text(); // put the name of the product in selectedName
[00:38:05] <vlad_> 		$('ul#orderedProducts li#'+selectedName.replace(/ /g,'')+'').remove(); // Find product by id and remove it (.replace(/ /g,'') removes empty space from id otherwise id wont work) 		$('ul#orderMenu li#totals').html("<h1>TOTAL: </h1><h5>$"+totals+"</h5>"); 		$('ul#orderedProducts li#total').html("<h4>You will be charged: $"+totals+"</h4>");
[00:38:08] <vlad_> something like this
[00:38:25] <vlad_> will i have advantage if i use json or arrays from php?
[00:38:36] <vlad_> and use array to make calculations
[00:38:40] <vlad_> which is t he right way
[00:38:52] <runvnc> MrTool, http://jsfiddle.net/cKr22/
[00:41:34] <MrTool> @runvnc: thanks for that,
[00:45:10] <vlad_> any body can help me?
[00:52:14] <runvnc> mrtool is that what you were trying to do
[00:54:32] <MrTool> not realy, but currently i had no time to explain it better cause i had to fix some critical bugs
[01:02:40] <AfroJack> guys how i can make someting like this http://www.worldofmerix.com/     hide everything at start and fade when page is loaded... i dont need style just black and load when its loaded or white etc...
[01:04:31] <AfroJack> i can pay you for this .
[01:08:19] <MrTool> @runvnc: now i had some time, maybe i can explain what i want:  I got an Huge Array with 714 Entries and 10 divs in my dom Element, for every one of the div i write the 714 Entries, so i got at least an loader with  "x from 7140", curently the whole for loops are finished in 2 seconds, i know counting from 0 to 7140 is to much so i want only to refresh the "x from 7140" all 500ms, the problem is that the loader is an own Plugin and the Writer is an own Plugin,
[01:29:31] <MrTool> @runvnc: do you understand what i mean?
[01:30:57] <gkunno> Hello, i have a grid of elements that flip, and a picture is shown on the "other" side, how could i autoturn the element efter a few seconds? One other alternative could be to turn the element if another element is clicked? I have been struggelign with this for a while and no success :) any help would be appreciated, http://pastebin.com/XHz5J8Yx
[01:32:34] <runvnc> You kind of lost me where you got to the plugins part mrtool
[01:32:41] <AfroJack> jquery before dom ready ? possible ?
[01:32:47] <runvnc> if you want to do something every 500ms, use setInterval
[01:33:53] <MrTool> @runvnc: can i query you??
[01:34:15] <runvnc> fine
[01:36:12] <clearing> hi i need help http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/
[01:36:47] <AfroJack> is jquery possible before dom ? or javascript
[01:38:59] <AfroJack> how you guys put a hide before dom loads?

[01:50:37] <NET||abuse> hi folks, i'm trying to optimize my site, after development we've found we're serving up to 15 js files per page, which is alittle extreme
[01:51:16] <NET||abuse> so i've set all the js's in the source to be un-minified, and i'm going to trying concatonating the list of js files for a given page and minify the concatonated version of the collection of js files,
[01:51:36] <NET||abuse> then hash the list of files names and use that as the filename of the new concat'd minified file
[01:51:55] <nFFF> Sounds good
[01:51:56] <NET||abuse> then serve that in the <script src  in the header of the pages
[01:52:31] <NET||abuse> is it silly to not just take thecombined list of all possible js files used in the site and just serve it once on the homepage and just serve that file every time to every page?
[01:52:54] <nFFF> The fewer the requests to the server the better
[01:53:00] <runvnc> you want to make sure to use etags
[01:53:03] <runvnc> or something like that
[01:53:07] <runvnc> if-modified-since
[01:53:09] <NET||abuse> it occured to me that by taking the distinct list of js files for any given page, you are re-serving minified segments of the same files repeatedly on different pages
[01:53:15] <clearing> hi i need help http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/
[01:53:18] <nFFF> combine all your images into sprites, combine your js files as much as possible, and css as well
[01:53:22] <runvnc> you want to combine them for sure
[01:53:31] <runvnc> except
[01:53:33] <runvnc> jquery
[01:53:38] <runvnc> serve jquery from google
[01:53:40] <NET||abuse> oh? why not jquery?
[01:53:53] <runvnc> because it will load closer from google cdn
[01:53:55] <NET||abuse> mmm, i'm a little against being reliant on google services for assets
[01:53:56] <runvnc> and may already be loaded
[01:53:59] <runvnc> in their cache
[01:54:02] <runvnc> well fine then dont
[01:54:26] <nFFF> lol a litle against relying on google to serve your jquery file? :???
[01:54:28] <NET||abuse> we're building so we can use 2 cdn's in failover
[01:54:41] <nFFF> whats the problem?
[01:54:54] <NET||abuse> well for example
[01:55:38] <NET||abuse> opendns had google marked as malicious for a period of time
[01:55:59] <NET||abuse> so everyone relying on google services for jquery and anything else was shutdown by anyone using opendns
[01:56:09] <runvnc> well whether you use google or not you should combine all the files
[01:56:13] <NET||abuse> because they're a big target issues like this can happen.
[01:56:14] <runvnc> I think
[01:56:32] <NET||abuse> yeh, i think so too
[01:56:44] <runvnc> but one reason I used googles cdn
[01:56:53] <NET||abuse> fair enough
[01:56:54] <runvnc> is most of my js was jquery
[01:57:05] <nFFF> most people use googles cdn, everyone seems to becoping fine
[01:57:10] <runvnc> which if anyone has visited any site using google's jquery since they cleared their cache
[01:57:13] <NET||abuse> mixed sources also gives you a wider socket pool for the browser, so it can load more in parallel
[01:57:18] <nFFF> and are you sure opendns had all of gogles cdn's marked as malicious?
[01:57:20] <runvnc> then they wont need to load that at all, it will be from cache
[01:58:45] <ximarin> hi all, question for the jquery ui datepicker: I use the button to trigger the calendar to open. problem ist, that the icon is not directly next to the input-field but like 5px higher. How con I get the icon to use the same baseline as my input-field?
[01:59:29] <NET||abuse> I'm not sure about the using google CDN or not thing, i'm a little bit in favour of it, but also feel like there's issues around relying on third party's to host your assets ... but that's not what i'm worried about today :)
[01:59:51] <runvnc> ximarin can you use chrome and open developer tools and look at metrics and computed styles
[02:00:01] <runvnc> maybe margin/padding.. also might try vertical align
[02:01:04] <clearing> hi i need help http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/
[02:01:59] <nFFF> clearing, whats up
[02:02:03] <ximarin> runvnc: already did that, there is nothing that changes position that way. I also looked at the css but couldnt find anything
[02:02:48] <nFFF> your second each going off of your markup in jsfiddle doesn't make any sense
[02:03:21] <nFFF> $(val + "_arr") == $('ab_arr'), which doesn't exist in the markup
[02:03:28] <nFFF> but apart from that everything works?
[02:04:25] <runvnc> you tried vertical align
[02:04:46] <ximarin> just on the div thats hald the picker-field
[02:04:48] <runvnc> if its not margin or padding or vertical align maybe the icon has a white background padding built into it or something
[02:04:57] <clearing> nFFF
[02:05:08] <clearing> i was try to call the ab_arr <- which is array
[02:05:13] <clearing> i dont know how to do it
[02:05:41] <Buss> how i can avoid IE,s fast dom lol on chrome and firefox it  display good but on IE the fast dom allways doing a milisecound of my nav ... :/ got you any tricks for that ?
[02:05:58] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/1/
[02:06:47] <Buss> nFFF :D try http://nobrain.dk
[02:07:44] <nFFF> Buss ?
[02:07:57] <Buss> nFFF ye?

[02:08:33] <clearing> http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/2/
[02:09:02] <clearing> it didnt return the right values of the array
[02:11:59] <Oxwil> Hello, I'm using themeroller to create a new theme, and encountered a bug which I'm not sure if it's related to the themeroller or jQuery itself.
[02:14:36] <Buss> http://nobrain.dk lol why its not working ? ...
[02:17:07] <nFFF> clearing, your trying to call a variable name using a string, its not good practise
[02:17:14] <nFFF> I suggest re-thinking how you re-write this code
[02:18:32] <gdoron> Hi
[02:18:56] <gdoron> How is it that "closest" is slower than "parents" in most cases?
[02:19:24] <gdoron> Is someone here?
[02:19:30] <nFFF> clearing: http://jsfiddle.net/9hRn6/3/
[02:20:24] <clearing> thank you nFFF
[02:20:30] <Oxwil> Hello, I'm using themeroller to create a new theme, and encountered a bug which I'm not sure if it's related to the themeroller or jQuery itself.
[02:20:45] <gdoron> How is it that "closest" is slower than "parents" in most cases?
[02:21:25] <Ar-ras> hi, how can i sort multiple items in jquery ui sortable
[02:21:31] <gdoron> Shesek, are you here?
[02:21:37] <shesek> yep
[02:21:48] <shesek> always :-)
[02:22:02] <gdoron> Hi habub
[02:22:06] <Ar-ras> does somebody know?
[02:22:19] <gdoron> Do you know what closest is slower than parents in most cases?
[02:22:19] <shesek> hey to you too
[02:22:41] <shesek> Ar-ras, your question doesn't make much sense
[02:22:42] <gdoron> *Why
[02:23:03] <Ar-ras> shesek: jquery ui sortable can sort one item at a time
[02:23:16] <Ar-ras> i used jquery ui selectable to select multiple item
[02:23:16] <Ar-ras> s
[02:23:34] <Ar-ras> now i want to sort them with sortable
[02:23:44] <shesek> gdoron, never noticed it... sounds odd tho, closest should be faster
[02:23:49] <gdoron> As I understand it, parents traverse the DOM up until the <body> so closest should be always faster or equal to parents
[02:23:54] <shesek> any jsperf with it?
[02:23:55] <gdoron> But it's not
[02:24:00] <gdoron> one moment please
[02:24:33] <shesek> Ar-ras, ah, I see. sorry, I don't know of a way to do that
[02:24:35] <gdoron> http://jsperf.com/jquery-parents-vs-closest/2
[02:24:56] <shesek> if Google doesn't show anything, try hitting jQuery's ml with that question, perhaps someone there knows
[02:25:12] <gdoron> I had to build a very complicated tree structure to make closest faster: http://jsperf.com/jquery-parents-vs-closest/9
[02:25:38] <gdoron> Sheske, how can you answer multiple askers at the same time?
[02:26:30] <Ar-ras> gdoron lol
[02:26:35] <shesek> I'm good at multi tasking? :-)
[02:26:46] <gdoron> :)
[02:26:47] <shesek> let me take a closer look at the source code... perhaps it'll show something
[02:26:58] <Ar-ras> in first example you use first()
[02:27:02] <Ar-ras> in second not?
[02:27:11] <gdoron> I'm looking at it now too. :)
[02:28:39] <Ar-ras> gdoron what happens if oyu use id instead of class selector? same speed?
[02:29:09] <gdoron> I didn't try, but I believe it will be the same
[02:29:15] <gdoron> You can edit the jsperf
[02:29:53] <shesek> gdoron, well, the code for parents sure is much less complicated - just a call to dir() with the parentNode property (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L243)
[02:30:33] <shesek> closest does more than that (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L85), not quite sure why just yet... lemme see
[02:30:37] <gdoron> What is "elem[ dir ];"?
[02:30:50] <gdoron> Thanks for the effort
[02:32:09] <shesek> gdoron, the `dir` being passed is `parentNode`, so `elem[dir]` is `elem.parentNode`
[02:32:31] <gdoron> why making it complicated?
[02:32:51] <shesek> that dir function is being used with some other properties too
[02:33:06] <gdoron> k
[02:33:20] <shesek> like nextSibling and previousSibling (for next(), prev(), nextAll(), etc)
[02:33:22] <gdoron> Well, I can't understand what's going on in closest
[02:33:37] <gdoron> Why is it that complctaed?
[02:33:49] <gdoron> it should only be a while loop searching for a parentNode
[02:34:43] <nFFF> parents() returns all parents and thus will climb upto the top of the DOM
[02:34:54] <nFFF> closest() returns the first found parent and stops
[02:36:14] <gdoron> That we know already, We don't know what closesy is signifcanly slower!
[02:36:52] <gdoron> Any thoughts?
[02:38:10] <nFFF> is slower?
[02:38:43] <gdoron> Yes, it is!
[02:38:50] <gdoron> weird, I know... :)
[02:40:22] <shesek> I'm really not sure :O
[02:40:43] <nFFF> Just seen an jsperf, it varies on the browser
[02:40:54] <nFFF> wierd
[02:40:55] <nights> anyone good at fonts?
[02:41:19] <nights> what font is used for the twilio logo? http://www.mobilecommons.com/wp-content/uploads/twilio-logo.png
[02:41:20] <gkunno> how could i make elements autoclick after some seconds, so the turneffect would "autohide" http://pastebin.com/XHz5J8Yx
[02:41:58] <runvnc> setTimeout( function() { $('.thebuttontohide').trigger('click');}, 6000) ;
[02:42:26] <gdoron> If you're not sure... WE ARE DOOMED!
[02:42:51] <shesek> for positional selectors it should be even slower than that, as it queries the whole document for elements matching the selector first, than checks if the elements are in that list
[02:43:13] <gkunno> ok thnxh will try
[02:43:32] <shesek> (:nth, :first, :eq, etc)
[02:44:08] <shesek> on large documents it should be significantly more slower than parents
[02:44:18] <gdoron> Why is it?
[02:44:27] <shesek> not sure why they do that on closest and not on parents... that's somewhat odd
[02:44:38] <shesek> s/more slower/slower
[02:45:10] <shesek> it looks for that selector on *the whole document*, than checks if the elements are in the list of the elements found
[02:45:35] <gdoron> Can you please explain me the source code?
[02:45:55] <gdoron> What this does: POS.test
[02:46:01] <shesek> which somehow makes sense, because positional selectors probably only makes sense in the context of the whole document or something... but than, it should be done on parents() too
[02:46:07] <gdoron> And this: jQuery.find.matchesSelector(cur, selectors)
[02:46:26] <shesek> POS is a regex, /:(nth|eq|gt|lt|first|last|even|odd)(?:\((\d*)\))?(?=[^\-]|$)/, which checks if its an positional selector
[02:46:34] <shesek> POS.test is just RegExp.prototype.test
[02:46:48] <gdoron> thanks
[02:46:53] <shesek> jQuery.find.matchesSelector() checks if a DOM element matches an selector, like is()
[02:47:21] <gdoron> I really don't understand why jQuery use every time different function!
[02:48:31] <shesek> matchesSelector is a low-level function that operates directly on a single DOM element
[02:48:36] <shesek> is() wraps that with some more logic
[02:49:45] <shesek> damn you and your questions, now you made me about that closest... and I gotta work :-(
[02:49:57] <shesek> * missing "curious" in that sentence there
[02:50:17] <gdoron> Me too... :)
[02:50:42] <gdoron> My boss here is angry, he only see me chating in mIRC... :)
[02:51:29] <gkunno> runvnc it worked! thanks alot!!
[02:51:33] <shesek> well, if its reproducible in your app.... `$.fn.closest = function(){  return $.fn.parents.apply(this,arguments).first(); }` FTW?
[02:52:05] <shesek> or probably `$.fn.fasterClosest = ...`
[02:52:08] <runvnc> sweet
[02:52:08] <gdoron> You want to override the closest function?
[02:52:09] <gdoron> :)
[02:52:13] <runvnc> gkunno who are you
[02:52:15] <gdoron> Cute
[02:52:20] <runvnc> what are you talking about
[02:52:33] <runvnc> oh nevermind
[02:52:35] <runvnc> I remember
[02:52:45] <runvnc> lol
[02:52:52] <gdoron> Shesek, want to talk about it later?
[02:54:07] <gdoron> Sheske: ?
[02:54:23] <gdoron> Shesek:?
[02:54:44] <shesek> or even `$.fn.uberFastClosest = function(){  var curr=this[0], matches; while (curr && !(matches=jQuery.find.matchesSelector(curr))) { curr = curr.parentNode; };  return $(matches ? curr : null) };`
[02:55:07] <gdoron> "uberFastClosest" LOL
[02:55:29] <shesek> (assuming it only operates on a single DOM element)
[02:55:52] <shesek> ah, forgot the selector there... `$.fn.uberFastClosest = function(selector){  var curr=this[0], matches; while (curr && !(matches=jQuery.find.matchesSelector(curr, selector))) { curr = curr.parentNode; };  return $(matches ? curr : null) };`
[02:56:06] <shesek> and it won't work with positional selectors afaik
[02:56:17] <shesek> and sure, we can talk about that later... we should probably get back to our work :-)
[02:56:27] <gdoron> When? בערב?
[02:57:03] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/include/video-test.php anyone know how i can preload the swf in the 'walkthrough' tab?
[02:57:13] <shesek> yeah, why not
[02:57:13] <johnline> it takes too long to appear and ruins the aesthetic
[02:57:31] <shesek> I got a meeting with some client later today, but I should be back around 8-9~
[02:57:51] <shesek> !g preload flash
[02:57:57] <runvnc> johnline: use an image in place of the swf
[02:58:02] <gdoron> Cool, I'm learning in a Yeshiva until 10:30, maybe then?
[02:58:26] <shesek> you're religious?
[02:58:40] <gdoron> It was weird, I was not... :)
[02:58:40] <shesek> like, חרדי, with all the clothes 'n everything?
[02:59:01] <gdoron> With uniforms, but it's not for public area, you know...
[02:59:26] <johnline> i did google for it, saw a load of junk and said to use left:-10000 to hide content, but im using fades
[02:59:52] <johnline> there is an img in place of the swf which gets replaced if flash is installed
[03:00:45] <gdoron> Talked to you later חבוב, nice talking with you, like always (those two times... ;-) )
[03:01:37] <gdoron> You can reach me at gdoron12345@gmail.com if you find something interesting. Later dude.
[03:02:06] <shesek> bye, talk to you later
[03:02:48] <shesek> johnline, you could probably find a way to preload the flash... but than you'll waste some bandwidth for users who don't go to that tab
[03:03:25] <shesek> what about putting an image that looks like the initial state of the flash when the users switches to the tab, and replacing it with the actual flash once its loaded?
[03:04:32] <shesek> or even putting that image until the user clicks it to start playing it, and than replace to the flash with autoplay (like some sites do)
[03:05:11] <johnline> true shesek, the swf itself is just small jwplayer, its not set to autoload the movie
[03:06:05] <johnline> hmm i've seen some porn sites do this
[03:06:24] <shesek> I've seen some landing pages do that
[03:06:28] <shesek> with their marketing videos on the first place
[03:06:31] <shesek> never saw it with porn, tho
[03:06:39] <shesek> * on the first page
[03:06:42] <shesek> * home page
[03:10:53] <Shucky> hi all
[03:11:36] <Hippie_> go away!
[03:11:40] <Hippie_> :D
[03:11:44] <Shucky> :D
[03:12:52] <Shucky> i use jquery validate to validate my form but i don't want to display error (label) for each input (just change the input style). how can i hide this error (label)?
[03:16:36] <johnline> seems clunky even if the swf is loaded
[03:19:52] <shesek> johnline, well, what was the problem with preloading it using left:-9999?
[03:20:18] <shesek> put it in the document, visible, outside the view port... than before starting any animation, put it back in its correct location
[03:33:04] <Flo0815> not really jQuery, but can someone please help me: i have 2 variables, containing numbers: var one = 100, var two = 0.0000052064968498409. no wnat to do simple calculation: var three = parseFloat(one) - parseFloat(two); the result is always NaN. Why?
[03:35:28] <andr0id1> how to make this result: success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name; } ) ) } a link?
[03:38:55] <TomTom> hi there, any idea how to solve this problem: i have an element/layer with mouseleave event (a context menu which colapses when the mouse goes out). but with IE7 it seems that the mouseleave event is also triggered when an element which is below/under the contextmenu is left. this happens only with IE7, IE8 and chrome are working as expected
[03:49:23] <johnline> i think i'll need to use something other than fadeOut()/fadeIn() shesek
[03:49:52] <johnline> since these control via display:none
[03:50:25] <johnline> its possible, just making my code less elegant
[03:50:37] <johnline> i'll live with the clunkiness for now
[03:50:48] <andr0id1> johnline, how to make this: success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name; } ) ) } a link?
[03:51:35] <johnline> sorry im a jquery nub
[03:51:52] <andr0id1> well, how to put el.name in a href?
[04:02:48] <shesek> johnline, no - start with the element visible but outside the viewport, but put it back to a regular hidden state (display:none, back into the viewport, in the correct position) before you start the animation
[04:03:00] <shesek> andr0id1, that question makes no sense
[04:04:28] <andr0id1> well, i want to do the following: html equivalent: <a href="somwhere">somewhere</a> , now, instead of somewhere, to have the value of: el.name
[04:04:33] <andr0id1> that is my question
[04:06:23] <andr0id1> does it makes sense now?
[04:06:56] <shoky> andr0id1 not really
[04:07:34] <shoky> to make a new <a>  you can do:  $('<a>', {href: someHref})
[04:07:45] <shoky> and then append that somewhere or something
[04:07:52] <johnline> it seems display:none > display:block reinitialises the flash embed done by swfobject.js
[04:08:18] <johnline> even if the player is cached
[04:08:52] <johnline> i'll come back to it once high priority stuff is done
[04:08:52] <andr0id1> ok, shoky , remember what you helped me earlier, about the json objects?
[04:09:34] <shoky> yep
[04:09:50] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/cu5PU68Y
[04:10:05] <shoky> yep..
[04:10:15] <andr0id1> now, the return: el.name , can i make it a link?
[04:10:36] <shoky> yes. but. 'data' is an array
[04:10:46] <shoky> it might contain more than one object, no ?
[04:10:51] <shoky> (depends on your serverside php..)
[04:11:22] <andr0id1> well yes, but since you click only on one of the names, it takes only the .name from one object
[04:11:37] <shoky> look
[04:12:02] <johnline> anyone know what i replace spaces with for a string?
[04:12:07] <johnline> $alt=emirati expressions cgi walkthrough;
[04:12:12] <johnline> (in php)
[04:12:31] <shoky> success: function(data) {  var arrayOfNames = $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name; } );  response( arrayOfNames );  ... then do whatever you want with arrayOfNames ... }
[04:12:44] <shoky> get it ?
[04:13:28] <shoky> for example if you expect it to contain only one name , then you can just take arrayOfNames[0]  as the href for your new link ..
[04:13:48] <fuchstronaut> http://pastebin.com/1cj0na0Z
[04:13:55] <fuchstronaut> how do i make that look less shitty?
[04:14:06] <andr0id1> yes, but i dont know how to get the value from .name and make it a link, to point to this link for ex: <a href ="?cid=search&q=" + el.name> something like that, do you get what i mean
[04:14:08] <andr0id1> ?
[04:14:12] <fuchstronaut> as children('element > element > #id') doesnt work
[04:14:51] <shoky> andr0id1: i told you, arrayOfNames  is AN ARRAY OF NAMES
[04:15:25] <andr0id1> ok, so how to make all of them links? every single array member?
[04:15:58] <shoky> andr0id1: so to make a new link:   $('<a href="?cid=search&q=' + arrayOfNames[0] + '">').appendTo( somewhere )
[04:16:10] <shoky> (for example.. )
[04:16:44] <shoky> or if you wanna make all of them links then you can use $.map again
[04:18:04] <fuchstronaut> tables.children('tbody').children('tr').children('td.editable, td.editable-optional').children('input,select')
[04:18:20] <fuchstronaut> how do i get this elements without calling children() 4 times?
[04:18:44] <shoky> like..  var links = $.map( arrayOfNames, function(el) { return $('<a>', {href: '?cid=search&q=' + el}) } )
[04:19:02] <shoky> then links is an array of jq objects of the links..
[04:19:51] <johnline> your idea of having an img and then replacing with flash on click would probably work best shesek, i'll work on this thanks
[04:25:45] <NET||abuse> Hi guys, i'm looking for a good way to take XHR posts from chrome's inspector network tab, and be able to copy their details to another POST fiddler like tool?
[04:25:53] <NET||abuse> anyone know something that can do something like this?
[04:26:21] <NET||abuse> I can right click and select Copy entry as HAR
[04:26:30] <NET||abuse> and past the json output of the POST request to notepad
[04:26:54] <NET||abuse> but i need a posting tool to fiddle the post around based on this post data
[04:27:35] <NET||abuse> i was thinking a chrom plugin could add a context entry to the Network inspector tab, that said, "open this in POST fiddler chrom plugin" or something more succinct
[04:27:58] <NET||abuse> but i've not found anything on the plugins site that can do any of the above yet.
[04:28:24] <NET||abuse> The "Rest Console" plugin has hAR support in the "coming soon" section,
[04:33:37] <shoky> NET||abuse you know about this?  http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/experimental.devtools.html
[04:35:29] <shoky> and this  http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/devtools.network.html
[04:43:49] <NET||abuse> shoky: nope, didn't know about a seperate set of tools
[04:43:52] <NET||abuse> tahnks.
[04:47:51] <jeffsmykil> I always get JSLint JSHint errors about using == instead of === should this be a concern?
[04:52:32] <shoky> jeffsmykil: it should be a concern to you to know the difference
[04:52:37] <scathen^C> jeffsmykil: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/javascript-vs-does-it-matter-which-equal-operator-i-use
[04:53:50] <scathen^C> anyone know of a solution to dragging the mouse too fast using resizable()?
[04:53:51] <shoky> i think i remember reading somewhere in the jquery sources that they use JSLint but only remove that specific warning ;P
[04:54:07] <shoky> scathen^C: what does it do?
[04:54:24] <jeffsmykil> interesting
[04:54:26] <varnie> Hi there.
[04:54:53] <scathen^C> if i drag too fast, the draggable div obviously loses mouse input, and the resizing stops until you move the mouse back over the resize div. (works if you move slowly)
[04:55:19] <jeffsmykil> shoky: that being read, do you do it
[04:55:23] <varnie> what's wrong with this line: "$(someSelector, 'option[value='+10+'] ~ option').each(function(){ $(this).attr('disabled', 'disabled');   });" //?
[04:55:50] <varnie> "each" function says "invalid number of parameters, expected 2..3"
[04:56:33] <scathen^C> varnie: does .attr('disabled', 'disabled') even do anything?
[04:57:07] <scathen^C> nvm
[04:57:19] <varnie> that $(this) there is that selector
[04:57:22] <varnie> not its options
[04:57:34] <shoky> jeffsmykil: i use === only when i am not sure about the types of what im comparing, i guess
[04:57:38] <varnie> and therefore it doesn't work as you noticed.
[04:58:07] <jeffsmykil> you mean when you are sure?
[04:58:25] <shoky> jeffsmykil for example, if you have:  var x = '0'
[04:58:36] <scathen^C> shoky: ok i realised that if i resize outwards it works fine, but inwards is where the speed stuffs up. inside my resizable area is a youtube embed so i am guessing this is taking the focus somehow....
[04:58:50] <shoky> jeffsmykil: well just,  '0' == 0 == null == false == undefined
[04:58:58] <shoky> but === would be false for all of those
[04:59:00] <varnie> but I I rewrite it like "$('#_form select[name="day"] option[value='+dayCount+'] ~ option') //etc" then it will work
[04:59:04] <shoky> understand?
[04:59:19] <jeffsmykil> my understanding is you should use it when you are doing like int === int
[04:59:30] <shoky> ah sorry undefined wont be equal
[04:59:40] <shoky> nor null
[04:59:45] <shoky> but 0 == '0' == false
[05:00:11] <vehsarcu> hello, how to convert $('#idofelem) to something like [textarea#description.first] ?
[05:00:25] <shoky> jeffsmykil: if i want to check that x is the number 0  (but NOT false and NOT '0')  then i  have to check with === 0
[05:00:38] <shoky> or if i want to make sure that it is '0'  i'll do  x === '0'
[05:00:45] <jeffsmykil> oh ok i think i understand
[05:01:03] <shoky> also any number besides 0 is == true
[05:01:16] <shoky> so if i want to check that x is 5 (but NOT the boolean value true)
[05:01:20] <shoky> i'll have to do x === 5
[05:01:28] <shoky> oh sorry
[05:01:30] <shoky> only 1 == true
[05:01:31] <andr0id1> shoky, it didnt work, all i am getting now is empty row
[05:01:48] <shoky> so if i wanna check if x is equal to 1 (but NOT true)
[05:01:54] <shoky> etc..
[05:02:05] <shoky> andr0id1: i dono what u did
[05:02:36] <shoky> scathen^C: donno sry
[05:02:39] <andr0id1> success: function(data) { response( $.map( data, function(el) { return $('<a>', {href: '?cid=search&q=' + el.name}); } ) ) }
[05:02:52] <shoky> that's not what i told you to do :(
[05:03:02] <shoky> now you are passing an array of links to  response()
[05:03:12] <Jagan_> hi..
[05:03:18] <shoky> but response just expects that array of names :\
[05:03:22] <andr0id1> tried with the arrayofnames you told me, but that doenst work at all
[05:03:44] <shoky> function(data) {  var arrayOfNames = $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name; } );  response( arrayOfNames );  ... then do whatever you want with arrayOfNames ... }
[05:03:55] <shoky> is what i told you
[05:04:04] <shoky> but you changed the already existing map...
[05:04:37] <shoky> andr0id1: do you know what $.map  does ?
[05:04:41] <Jagan_> how to send request to verify recaptcha with google using ajax method?
[05:04:51] <shoky> andr0id1: do you know what that  'response(...)' callback does?
[05:05:01] <shoky> andr0id1: do you know what the 'success' callback does?
[05:05:32] <andr0id1> response from the server, and if the response has succeded
[05:05:39] <incognit0> \join jqueryui
[05:05:43] <shoky> varnie: can you repeat the question
[05:05:54] <varnie> one moment please.
[05:07:52] <andr0id1> shoky, success: function(data) { var arrayOfNames = $.map( data, function(el) { return $('<a>', {href: '?cid=search&q=' + el.name}); } );  response( arrayOfNames );} but i still get empty rows
[05:08:45] <varnie> shoky, I presented it there: http://pastebin.com/RVypQjBM
[05:09:08] <shoky> andr0id1 that's still not what i told you to do
[05:09:16] <shoky> dont change the first map!
[05:09:20] <varnie> shoky, i.e. I tried to reuse already gotten selector but failed.
[05:10:03] <Jagan_> how to send request to verify recaptcha with google using ajax method? an anyone help me?
[05:10:25] <andr0id1> than what is it? i really cant quite see the thing you are trying to tell me to do...
[05:10:34] <shoky> andr0id1:  success: function(data) {  var arrayOfNames = $.map( data, function(el) { return el.name; } );  response( arrayOfNames );  var links = $.map( arrayOfNames, function(el) { return $('<a>', {href: '?cid=search&q=' + el}) } );   ... now you have an array links ... }
[05:12:11] <shoky> varnie: you got it in the wrong order.  you need either:  $('option[value='+dayCount+'] ~ option',  daySelector).each(...
[05:12:36] <shoky> or better:  daySelector.find('option[value='+dayCount+'] ~ option').each(...
[05:13:39] <andr0id1> shoky, got it now, but it still doesnt do the search
[05:13:40] <shoky> (the first way will implicitly run the second one anyway, so just use the second way)
[05:14:04] <varnie> shoky, thanks a lot!
[05:14:07] <andr0id1> it is just placing it in the search field, doesnt do search
[05:14:22] <chee> hm
[05:14:33] <shoky> np varnie
[05:14:54] <shoky> andr0id1: what search
[05:15:01] <Nece228> hello
[05:15:41] <varnie> one more simple question: var fooItem = $(someSelector).find('li').removeClass('bar'); //will after that fooItem will be that "li" selector?
[05:15:44] <andr0id1> well, the idea was when i click on the autocomplete, it needs to take me on the link i specified, the one with ? but its not doin it
[05:16:02] <shoky> varnie: yeah
[05:16:14] <varnie> and there's no reason to use .removeClass separately
[05:16:16] <varnie> ?
[05:16:22] <shoky> what do you mean?
[05:16:31] <shoky> no, chaining is fine
[05:16:39] <varnie> okay, I see.
[05:16:48] <shoky> removeClass will return the "last context"
[05:16:58] <andr0id1> in the inspect element, i got this for the link: <a class="ui-corner-all" tabindex="-1">Antonescu Crin</a>
[05:17:10] <andr0id1> it doesnt get the: href part
[05:17:30] <shoky> andr0id1: pastebin ;p
[05:17:31] <varnie> shoky, but the following won't work: $(...).get(1).addClass(...)
[05:17:47] <andr0id1> of the ajax or the form?
[05:17:58] <varnie> it should be rewritten as: var foo = $(...).get(1); $(foo).addClass(...);
[05:17:59] <shoky> varnie: .get() gets the actual DOM element that the jq object is wrapping
[05:18:04] <shoky> varnie: you're looking for  .eq(1)
[05:18:15] <varnie> wow:) thanks
[05:18:32] <shoky> (just in case: its zero-indexed)
[05:19:17] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/RBQ0FP4x that is the script that makes the ajax calls
[05:19:19] <shoky> andr0id1: of the ajax
[05:19:19] <varnie> indeed.
[05:19:53] <shoky> andr0id1:  you forgot the last part i told you:    ... now you have an array links ...
[05:20:08] <shoky> you have to do something with that array or its not gonna be in the DOM..
[05:20:14] <andr0id1> and in the inspect element, i got this for the link: <a class="ui-corner-all" tabindex="-1">Antonescu Crin</a> it doesnt put the href part
[05:20:34] <scathen^C> ok i think i know how to fix my problem. i need to place a transparent div over the iframe so that the iframe doesn't get any mouse events. anyone know to do this?
[05:20:38] <shoky> andr0id1: for example.  $(links).appendTo('body')   will append the links to the body element
[05:21:35] <andr0id1> in my case, cause i want when i click on the name to take me directly to search, where to append the links to?
[05:21:49] <shoky> scathen^C: just make a div with position:absolute  and set its left/top/width/height/z-index
[05:22:09] <shoky> scathen^C: but i donno how you'll be able to resize anything then ;p
[05:22:35] <shoky> andr0id1: ah so thats what you want
[05:22:38] <antnash> Hey guys. Would I use a data selector (with class too) thusly, $('.class[data-key=value]') ?
[05:22:52] <andr0id1> yes, i've been trying to tell you that all the time
[05:22:56] <shoky> andr0id1: have you fully read all of the autocomplete docs?
[05:23:06] <shoky> andr0id1: no you haven't said that you just said you want links
[05:23:09] <andr0id1> not exactly
[05:23:26] <andr0id1> i red everything that was on the website though
[05:23:29] <andr0id1> i mean
[05:23:30] <shoky> andr0id1: then read all of it. TWICE. then try to solve it , for an hour
[05:23:35] <e01> i have to do a page to scroll normally for iPad
[05:23:39] <shoky> then if you are stuck, ask here again
[05:23:41] <e01> the problem is that i am using gmap v2 and when it's loaded and its take 100% of screen i am not able to scroll the page, so i think i have to do touching scroll functionality with jquery itself
[05:23:43] <shoky> but read the whole thing
[05:23:45] <e01> any suggestions about it?
[05:23:49] <andr0id1> ok
[05:23:54] <shoky> and if you dont understand something in the docs, ask here
[05:24:12] <andr0id1> ok :)
[05:24:19] <shoky> ;]
[05:24:24] <antnash> Hey shoky, a very quick easy one. class & data selector. Like this? $('.class[data-key=value]') ?
[05:24:43] <shoky> antnash: looks fine
[05:24:58] <antnash> excellent! Just wanted to make sure
[05:25:03] <shoky> kool
[05:27:35] <shoky> antnash: a more effective way of quickly checking that is going to jqfiddle.net , typing  <div class="heh" data-key="LoL"></div>  in the HTML.  typing  console.log( $('.heh[data-key=LoL]') )   in the JS,   and clicking Run
[05:27:58] <antnash> good plan
[05:28:06] <antnash> I'll keep a fiddle window open at all times
[05:28:31] <shoky> or bookmark it ;p
[05:35:07] <shoky> ah and you'd also need to choose 'onLoad' or smth in jsfiddle ;p
[05:37:47] <Nece228> is there a way to actually send variable to other javascript file?
[05:38:14] <pachet> send it to a file?
[05:38:18] <Haprog> wtf
[05:38:32] <Nece228> yes
[05:38:56] <Haprog> You want your code to write to files?
[05:39:00] <Nece228> i have file script.js and i want to send that variable data to products.js
[05:39:09] <Nece228> no
[05:39:38] <pachet> Nece228: once a js resource is loaded, the engine doesnt care whether it originally existed in a discrete file or not
[05:40:16] <pachet> you could damn well split a single small library into 30 different files, and include them all one after the other
[05:40:26] <pachet> aside from the overhead from the added reqs, the effect would be the same
[05:40:50] <Nece228> well i have a form and i need to send form data not only to server but to the other javascript file
[05:41:21] <Haprog> *facepalm*
[05:41:29] <Haprog> you don't send data to files
[05:41:49] <Nece228> by sending i mean retrieving the data later in javascript
[05:42:02] <pachet> we're getting closer to accuracy
[05:42:33] <Nece228> so im sending a form which has data equal to say int 4
[05:42:47] <Nece228> form action is to open products.php page
[05:43:10] <Nece228> when the products.php opens the script should be executed and javascript should retrieve that int 4
[05:43:32] <Haprog> so you want products.php to make the data available in JS
[05:44:11] <pachet> <? echo('<script>mynamespace.somevariable = 4;</script>'); ?>   :[
[05:44:12] <Haprog> just echo it in <script> var data = <?php echo json_encode($data); ?></script> or something like that
[05:45:26] <Nece228> hmm thanks for that
[05:45:29] <Nece228> i havent thinked of
[05:45:42] <Haprog> for example if you have a multidimentional array in PHP and want to access it in javascript you can just json_encode it to a proper javascript object
[05:45:51] <Haprog> or it could just be an int or string or whatever
[05:45:59] <Nece228> btw is there any way i could do getJSON when the json file has html tags and other similair stuff?
[05:46:19] <pachet> :[
[05:46:26] <pachet> its either valid json, or its not
[05:46:34] <incognit0> Has anyone ever had the need for a jQuery Widget that's a date/time picker, rather than simply date?
[05:46:36] <Haprog> there is no problem if you mean that the JSON data has strings containing html. but if it's not valid JSON then you can't use that
[05:47:06] <Nece228> hmm, then i should just use .post and later retrieve what i want with parseJSON?
[05:47:43] <pachet> i find it easier to do the opposite
[05:47:53] <pachet> if you have html too, just escape that within the json struct
[05:47:56] <Haprog> Nece228: would maybe help if you explained what you're trying to accomplish?
[05:48:15] <Nece228> its kind of hard to explain
[05:48:32] <Haprog> if you want to fetch HTML or something else than JSON you could just use load() or something
[05:48:51] <Nece228> as i said when i click on a form i open products.php
[05:49:11] <Haprog> or get() instead of getJSON()
[05:50:34] <Nece228> then i want to retrieve that form data number, in that products.php i would execute the script which would do getJSON and i would send that retrieved form data number to product.php, and could receive the json output
[05:50:52] <mantas322> is there any reason why IE is garbage???
[05:50:56] <mantas322> and my jquery doesnt work on it?
[05:51:40] <Nece228> mantas322: del to kad tu lietuvis
[05:51:52] <mantas322> turbut
[05:54:05] <pachet> mantas322: 'doesnt work' isnt communicating anything meaningful
[05:54:26] <mantas322> I'll be back pachet
[05:59:05] <Sudhansu> hi
[05:59:19] <pachet> hi
[05:59:36] <Sudhansu> i need some kind of help
[05:59:55] <pachet> that narrows it down
[06:01:17] <Sudhansu> i have a web menu that fetches a content using load() method.... when the method retrives it using load() method the web page functionality not working
[06:01:42] <Haprog> Nece228: are you submitting the form normally so the browser loads the product.php or do you submit the form data with jQuery so the current URL doesn't change?
[06:02:14] <pachet> Sudhansu: going out on a limb in interpreting what you mean, but -- are you saying that you are trying to bind event listeners to elements that arent loaded yet?
[06:02:23] <Sudhansu> i  added a custom function to convert input address to respective geocode
[06:02:31] <Haprog> if you submit normally and the url changes to product.php you don't need any getJSON(). the data is already available in a JS variable when you echo it as json_encoded to the script.
[06:02:43] <Sudhansu> from the google libary
[06:02:50] <Nece228> Haprog: i submit normally because i need to load product.php
[06:03:03] <Sudhansu> if i omit the custom function it z working
[06:03:30] <pachet> Nece228: a 'normal' submission and redirect isnt necessary to load anything ( on your domain, at least )
[06:03:39] <emilkarl> How can I make multiple ajax calls to a php server and not make call waiting as pending until req 1 is done
[06:04:10] <pachet> Sudhansu: do you get any console errors?
[06:04:18] <Sudhansu> no
[06:04:41] <Haprog> emilkarl: err, you know what AJAX stands for?
[06:04:58] <Sudhansu> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>     <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>        <script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="dimensions.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="autocomplete.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script type="text/javascript">
[06:04:58] <Haprog> emilkarl: it's asynchronous by definition
[06:05:04] <emilkarl> yes
[06:05:10] <Sudhansu> that is my code
[06:05:14] <Haprog> emilkarl: they work like that by default.
[06:05:27] <emilkarl> it does the requests….but the server stalls the requests
[06:05:44] <Sudhansu> when i load using load().... the custom function working
[06:05:50] <emilkarl> so I can see query making the requests but then the browser waits for response from the server
[06:06:02] <pachet> emilkarl: normally the browser is what imposes the maximum limit on the number of requests, not the server
[06:06:03] <Sudhansu> if i load the page directly it is working
[06:06:07] <pachet> normally its 6 per domain
[06:06:14] <pachet> emilkarl: are you using php?
[06:06:42] <Sudhansu> hhm using php
[06:07:28] <emilkarl> yes php
[06:07:31] <emilkarl> pachet
[06:07:33] <pachet> emilkarl: are you using sessions?
[06:07:36] <emilkarl> well I'm just doing 2
[06:07:39] <emilkarl> yes
[06:07:45] <pachet> there we are
[06:07:51] <emilkarl> pachet?
[06:07:54] <pachet> ?g php ajax session blocking @ emilkarl
[06:07:57] <Sudhansu> i am writing custom function for a textbox...  but it is not working
[06:08:03] <pachet> eh...
[06:08:10] <emilkarl> packet is there any way around that?
[06:08:15] <pachet> emilkarl: http://konrness.com/php5/how-to-prevent-blocking-php-requests/
[06:08:27] <emilkarl> aah ?g = google :P
[06:08:29] <emilkarl> ok thanks
[06:08:29] <emilkarl> ¨
[06:08:41] <pachet> emilkarl: normally the bot will google it for us when we query with ?g
[06:08:49] <pachet> but apparently bot-t is out fighting dragons again
[06:09:16] <Sudhansu> hey how to load custom  javascript function
[06:09:24] <Sudhansu> using jquery
[06:09:30] <emilkarl> aah ok
[06:09:32] <emilkarl> thanks
[06:09:38] <emilkarl> I'll look in to this...
[06:09:50] <emilkarl> but doesn't this session_write_close(); open up for ddos?
[06:10:07] <pachet> emilkarl: if you dont use it correctly, it can
[06:10:12] <emilkarl> ok
[06:10:32] <pachet> emilkarl: actually its a lot easier to ddos with long lived sessions than short ones
[06:10:56] <pachet> but this is more ##php than #jq
[06:11:16] <pachet> Sudhansu: load a custom javascript function? id imagine by loading a custom javascript file containing that function : [
[06:11:27] <pachet> ?getScript @ Sudhansu
[06:11:33] <pachet> bleh!
[06:11:37] <emilkarl> of course pachet
[06:11:38] <emilkarl> thansk
[06:11:39] <emilkarl> 
[06:11:55] <pachet> Sudhansu: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[06:11:58] <emilkarl> all requests still is pending tho
[06:12:15] <Sudhansu> i am using also it is not workinh
[06:13:19] <Sangeetha> Hi all, how to get rounded corners for textbox
[06:13:36] <pachet> Sangeetha: google box-radius
[06:13:44] <pachet> Sangeetha: also, see #css
[06:13:56] <pachet> Sangeetha: unless you mean a jq ui elem
[06:14:27] <emilkarl> closed in the wrong end, it works now
[06:14:43] <pachet> Sudhansu: 'not working' doesnt tell me anything useful
[06:14:51] <pachet> emilkarl: :D
[06:15:16] <Sudhansu> i am loaded using  getscript method it is not working
[06:15:25] <Sudhansu> could i provide the web link
[06:15:44] <pachet> is the error callback assigned and being fired?
[06:15:54] <pachet> can you see the status of the request in your net console?
[06:15:54] <Sudhansu> fired
[06:16:13] <Sudhansu> no
[06:16:25] <pachet> well, that would be the first step
[06:16:40] <Sudhansu> how to do that
[06:16:45] <pachet> should show up as a GET for your file path with a timestamp cachebuster on the end
[06:17:00] <pachet> Sudhansu: chrome dev tools? firebug? or ( god forbid ) IE dev console?
[06:17:35] <Sudhansu> IE
[06:17:40] <mantas322> :D ^
[06:18:20] <Sangeetha> hi pachet, i want to do using jquery ui
[06:20:48] <rufsketch1> Hello everyone. I'm trying to send a json object with a post. However, in this json object is an array object.
[06:21:39] <rufsketch1> Is there any way to have $.post automatically send each value with the same parameter name
[06:21:55] <rufsketch1> currently, it appends [] onto the variable name
[06:22:01] <rufsketch1> err, key name
[06:22:19] <rufsketch1> and the backend I'm using doesn't play well with that.
[06:22:57] <pachet> just convert it from an array to an obj with numeric keys
[06:23:56] <rufsketch1> pachet, I need each key to be identical.
[06:24:04] <Sangeetha>  how to use get rounded corners using jquery
[06:24:08] <rufsketch1> unless I'm misunderstanding you?
[06:24:15] <pachet> rufsketch1: oh
[06:25:51] <pachet> var source = ['foo','bar','baz'], result = { }, current; while(source.length){current = source.shift();result[source]=source;} i guess
[06:25:57] <pachet> kind of redundant, but gets the job done
[06:26:07] <pachet> or just join('.') the array and assign that string somewhere
[06:26:11] <pachet> then explode on the server side
[06:26:13] <hlvewentcrazy> Sangeetha, you don't. You get rounded corners with CSS.
[06:26:23] <scathen^C> yay finally got in place dynamic resizing of embedly pastes.......
[06:26:30] <hlvewentcrazy> Using Border-radius, which is CSS3.
[06:26:33] <Sangeetha> Using jquery
[06:26:38] <hlvewentcrazy> No
[06:26:50] <Sangeetha> CSS3 doesnt support IE
[06:27:01] <z0ned> after i select an element, how can i remove all class names beginning with something?   $("#something").removeClass("^=prefix"); equivalent?
[06:27:23] <hlvewentcrazy> Use something like PIE.htc. This isn't a jQuery question
[06:27:24] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[06:27:42] <Sangeetha> means?
[06:27:46] * hlvewentcrazy sighs
[06:28:01] <z0ned> Sangeetha, you use CSS. not javascript.
[06:28:16] <Sangeetha> CSS does nt support IE
[06:28:28] <hlvewentcrazy> z0ned, he's trying to get CSS3 to work in unsupported browsers, and just can't word the question properly lol
[06:28:29] <z0ned> Sangeetha, then use a background image. or PIE CSS
[06:28:38] <z0ned> lol
[06:28:52] <hlvewentcrazy> Sangeetha, Google PIE.htc, it will explain how to get CSS3 to work in IE
[06:28:53] <z0ned> Sangeetha, http://css3pie.com/
[06:28:59] <hlvewentcrazy> that, too
[06:29:00] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[06:29:36] <Sangeetha> thanks zoned
[06:30:02] <hlvewentcrazy> ...
[06:30:03] <hlvewentcrazy> o_o
[06:30:08] <hlvewentcrazy> i don't even
[06:30:10] * xec_ hugs hlvewentcrazy
[06:30:24] <Sangeetha> whts so funny with Mr hlvewentcrazy, i don knw
[06:30:25] <z0ned> haha
[06:30:31] <xec_> no wonder you went crazy
[06:30:35] <hlvewentcrazy> hahah
[06:30:46] * hlvewentcrazy hugus xec_ back.
[06:30:57] <xec_> mmmm hugus, tastes like chicken
[06:31:03] <z0ned> ill thank you hlvewentcrazy ;0
[06:31:12] <andr0id1> shoky, you here?
[06:31:24] <hlvewentcrazy> Thanks z0ned, atleast I'm appreciated somewhere!
[06:31:31] <hlvewentcrazy> Shoky is my favorite jquery wizard
[06:31:32] <z0ned> wanna answer my question?? for two thanks!
[06:32:32] <xec_> z0ned: you can't do that easily
[06:32:34] <hlvewentcrazy> what's up?
[06:32:55] <xec_> z0ned: you'd need to loop through the class names manually and check each one
[06:33:08] <z0ned> ah. damn
[06:33:26] <xec_> z0ned: the starts with attribute selector would just look at the first class name
[06:34:05] <xec_> if there's a limited number of class names it might be better to use something like .hasClass()
[06:34:08] <pachet> xec_: well, you could specify that the attribute starts with a string equiv to multiple class names
[06:34:19] <pachet> but im nitpicking
[06:34:53] <xec_> pachet: yes, i'm assuming he has multiple classes on the same element
[06:35:03] <xec_> pachet: or am i misunderstanding what you mean?
[06:35:16] <z0ned> i wish prof's would have taught us regex's
[06:35:28] <z0ned> they confuse me
[06:35:48] <xec_> they are easy! just hold down shift and spam the number keys on your keyboard
[06:35:50] <pachet> var classes = elem.attr('class').split(' ').map(function(item){return ( item.indexOf(something) !== -1 );}); elem.attr('class', classes.join(' '))
[06:35:51] <xec_> instant regex
[06:36:03] <pachet> z0ned: something like the above, maybe
[06:36:44] <xec_> pachet: yeah that looks pretty smooth
[06:37:48] <rufsketch1> pachet, is there any way to just make jquery not append [] to the end of the key name?
[06:38:03] <z0ned> pachet, thanks
[06:38:10] * hlvewentcrazy throws a pan at Sangeetha
[06:38:14] <rufsketch1> pachet, right now if I do something like {resources: ['a', 'b', 'c']
[06:38:41] <rufsketch1> pachet, it posts as resources[] = a & resources[] = b & resources[] = c
[06:38:42] <pachet> rufsketch1: oh my bad, in that thing i posted originally i was setting the key => value to [source] = source, when it should have been [current]=current;
[06:38:47] <pachet> hopefully that didnt cause confusion
[06:38:59] <scathen^C> am i blind? where is the damn volume control on a soundcloud embed? anyone?
[06:39:12] <pachet> rufsketch1: but what i was getting at, is that if you want a list of items but not in an array format, you have to resort to another data type
[06:39:21] <pachet> namely a delimited string or an object
[06:39:42] <hlvewentcrazy> scathen^C, there probably isn't one... they took forever to put the one on the site lol
[06:40:21] <scathen^C> lol wtf....isnt that the first thing they should do?
[06:41:31] <rufsketch1> pachet, yeah, I just don't want to deal with that considering jquery is killing the output with just two characters
[06:42:08] <BrixSat> hello, i have a problem with this, this runs alert 1 then 3 and finaly 2 :(  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1016351/ how can i make 1 2 3 sequential?
[06:42:10] <rufsketch1> I assume it's a feature, but there has to be some way to turn it off right?
[06:42:38] <pachet> its not a feature of jquery, if thats what you mean
[06:42:54] <pachet> its the standard way of encoding an array within a query string
[06:43:37] <rufsketch1> pachet, to pop [] onto the end?
[06:43:42] <pachet> BrixSat: this is the facebook api or some such?
[06:43:53] <BrixSat> pachet: yes
[06:44:04] <BrixSat> fb api
[06:44:05] <pachet> BrixSat: its an asynchronous response, so the callback ('function (response)') isnt going to fire until that request has resolved
[06:44:16] <pachet> which is necessarily after the current execution context resolves
[06:44:31] <BrixSat> pachet:  so how can i get the response and return it ?
[06:44:37] <pachet> BrixSat: you can't
[06:44:49] <BrixSat> i must!
[06:44:52] <pachet> then you lose
[06:44:57] <BrixSat> i cant loose :p
[06:45:07] <pachet> maybe not, but you can assuredly lose
[06:45:08] <BrixSat> either one way or another i have to make it
[06:45:14] <pachet> im not sure what loosing would be, sounds vulgar
[06:45:37] <BrixSat> that is a function that must return the response to the function who called it
[06:45:48] <scathen^C> hahaha wtf, sound cloud decided to not put a volume control on the new widget.....
[06:46:00] <pachet> BrixSat: then figure out how to tweak the FB api to enable synchronous execution of requests
[06:46:30] <BrixSat> pachet:  :( tks
[06:46:45] <pachet> but blocking requests are bad and will bring the devil up out of hell and have him tear up all your favorite pokemon cards
[06:46:58] <pachet> just as a warning
[06:49:21] <tronne> window already has some keypress events
[06:49:27] <tronne> can I append to them instead of replacing them
[06:49:45] <pachet> thats a complicated answer
[06:49:57] <pachet> but yes
[06:50:07] <pachet> first, why wouldnt you just add a new event?
[06:50:31] <tronne> that's what I mean
[06:50:45] <pachet> oh
[06:51:00] <pachet> well, this is jquery, so im assuming you're not using inline events
[06:51:21] <pachet> which is the most common way of overwriting a prior listener completely :p
[06:51:34] <pachet> with jquery, any subsequent event bound within jquery isnt overwriting priors
[06:51:44] <tronne> cool
[06:53:59] <rufsketch1> pachet, I solved it!
[06:54:11] <n00b5736> is there a plugin that does the social icon effect like whats being done on this page? http://demo.dotwired.de/walterwhite_html/
[06:54:18] <pachet> rufsketch1: what was the solution?
[06:54:40] <rufsketch1> pachet wrap the object win $.param( MyJSONObject, true)
[06:55:01] <rufsketch1> pachet, that boolean tells it to parse the traditional way
[06:55:21] <pachet> n00b5736: they're just animating the background position of each icon on hover
[06:55:43] <hlvewentcrazy> i like how the template is called walterwhite lol
[06:55:48] <n00b5736> pachet is there a tutorial on how to do that?
[06:55:55] <hlvewentcrazy> n00b5736, why not look at the source code and see?
[06:55:56] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[06:57:28] <Trisox> any one knows way Match: true is removed from jquery ui autocomplete or i'm i overseeing something
[06:57:36] <n00b5736> I don't see any jquery associated with it
[06:58:30] <mantas322> im back
[06:58:31] <pachet> n00b5736: $('.social_icon').on('mouseover.mynamespace', function(){$(this).stop().animate({'background-position-y':'-32px'})});
[06:58:43] <pachet> n00b5736: then in the mouseout, just animate back to '0px'
[06:59:31] <mantas322> okay so i have a jquery which onload populates a listview div dynamically
[06:59:55] <mantas322> now I want to handle the click event of each element in this div
[07:00:18] <mantas322> sorry if my question are nonsense, im very new to jquery
[07:00:33] <hlvewentcrazy> if it's populating the divs dynamically, why not also add classes dynamically as well, and then target the classes?
[07:00:46] <pachet> :[
[07:00:49] <pachet> i disagree with that
[07:00:54] <hlvewentcrazy> I take the easy way out
[07:00:55] <hlvewentcrazy> sry
[07:01:10] <mantas322> its populating a div with <li id="' + item.PM_ID + '" ><a href="">' + item.PM_TITLE + '</a></li>
[07:01:20] <pachet> yeah.. i was going to say
[07:01:31] <pachet> if you're already dealing with discrete elements in your function
[07:01:34] <pachet> just bind them on the spot
[07:01:46] <pachet> no need to require a separate class selector $ call to hit them with your callback fn
[07:01:58] <mantas322> okay.
[07:02:02] <mantas322> I think i understand
[07:02:03] <mantas322> ty
[07:02:04] <Trisox> can someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XXwTX/ ??
[07:02:18] <hlvewentcrazy> pachet, my approach wasn't wrong though ;P
[07:02:21] <hlvewentcrazy> Just lazy.
[07:02:40] <sebastian_o|> gf3: NO U!
[07:02:54] <Trisox> sebastian_o|: he aint here i think
[07:03:08] <sebastian_o|> heh
[07:03:20] <sebastian_o|> thx for letting me know Trisox
[07:03:28] <Trisox> :p
[07:03:50] <pachet> hlvewentcrazy: there's rarely a black and white when it comes to wrong
[07:04:06] <pachet> your approach adds overhead because it requires the engine to query the DOM for elements it was already touching in the first place
[07:04:07] <hlvewentcrazy> it makes the color gray, silly
[07:04:08] <sebastian_o|> hey guys when you ask for an element in jquery, it always returns a new (different) instance?
[07:04:20] <pachet> the overhead is marginal, but its there
[07:05:06] <hlvewentcrazy> but if the code doesn't need to be further maintained, and still functions properly, i don't see an issue
[07:05:07] <hlvewentcrazy> ;\
[07:05:20] <Trisox> sebastian_o|: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XXwTX/ what goes wrong
[07:06:06] <pachet> hlvewentcrazy: i guess im just not often in situations that dont require code to be maintained
[07:06:49] <pachet> sebastian_o|: yes, its technically a different instance
[07:07:15] <sebastian_o|> yeah, $('#secondDestination')===$('#secondDestination')  is false
[07:07:28] <sebastian_o|> mmm ok
[07:07:41] <pachet> $('#foo').get(0)===$('#foo').get(0) though, which is what matters
[07:07:57] <sebastian_o|> but this is true:    $('#secondDestination')[0]===$('#secondDestination')[0]
[07:08:01] <pachet> right
[07:08:09] <sebastian_o|> ok
[07:08:36] <sebastian_o|> booo why first doesn't work?  $('#secondDestination').first()
[07:08:51] <sebastian_o|> I should only use [0]  for that?
[07:09:01] <sebastian_o|> ok no biggie
[07:09:16] <pachet> first() still returns a jquery object
[07:09:19] <pachet> not a dom element
[07:09:54] <sebastian_o|> yeah I saw and is kind of wierd because you expect it to answer the first element of the whatever collection you're talking to
[07:11:23] <NoiseEee> sebastian_o|: you're searching by ID, not gathering a collection
[07:12:12] <sebastian_o|> hey NoiseEee! is it wrong to expect multiple results to be received in a collection of those things?
[07:12:35] <Flo0815> hey, quikc question: if i have three divs, all with the class 'box', how can i select the second one?
[07:12:45] <Flo0815> $('.box')[1] ?
[07:12:50] <pachet> sebastian_o|: yes
[07:12:56] <pachet> because ids are necessarily unique
[07:13:07] <sebastian_o|> huh?
[07:13:13] <pachet> Flo0815: $('.box').eq(1)
[07:13:19] <Flo0815> thx
[07:13:39] <NoiseEee> sebastian_o|: no elements can share duplicate IDs.  classes, sure... but not IDs.
[07:13:41] <pachet> Flo0815: like was said to sebastian_o|, the array notation fetches the actual dom element associated with that jquery object in that position
[07:13:42] <sebastian_o|> ah you mean they will always answer a collection with one element?
[07:13:49] <pachet> who is they
[07:14:11] <Flo0815> just joined, didn't saw it, pachet
[07:14:16] <Flo0815> but thx anyway
[07:14:50] <sebastian_o|> yeah sorry I mean it (jquery)
[07:15:30] <sebastian_o|> my point is… a collection with one element is still a collection
[07:16:07] <sebastian_o|> I'll use [0] to get the first element no problem but that doesn't fix the inconsistence
[07:16:13] <pachet> why
[07:16:18] <NoiseEee> sebastian_o|: you're missing something
[07:16:26] <NoiseEee> sebastian_o|: you don't need anything at all.  $('#id').
[07:16:27] <pachet> why are you using jquery at all
[07:16:32] <pachet> if you're only needing the actual dom entity
[07:16:43] <pachet> why not just document.getElementById('foo')
[07:16:46] <NoiseEee> sebastian_o|: $('#id')[0] will give you the bare element sans jquery methods.  indeed ^^
[07:16:46] <pachet> and save yourself the kilobytes
[07:17:50] <pachet> guess that question's going unanswered for a while
[07:20:21] <Cubud> HI all
[07:20:39] <shoky> andr0id1: im here
[07:20:45] <pachet> Cubud: hi
[07:21:36] <Cubud> I have a web site which will accept a JSON request.  I now need to ensure that the request is coming from a legitimate user (username/password in database) - the request will come from a Windows app into which the user will have entered their username+password - what is the best way to transmit this request?
[07:21:48] <NoiseEee> Cubud: over ssl
[07:21:50] <pachet> ^
[07:21:58] <Cubud> plain password over https, or a password hash over https?
[07:22:10] <shoky> oo he pwned you giuse
[07:22:13] <shoky> guise
[07:22:15] <NoiseEee> lol
[07:22:29] <NoiseEee> its fairly irrelevant at that point
[07:22:37] <NoiseEee> as long as its SSL nobody will see it in transit
[07:23:08] <Cubud> I was thinking maybe I need to make sure the password in my windows app is not reversible, so just store it as a hash?
[07:23:25] <Cubud> Or am I being too paranoid? :)
[07:23:31] <pachet> dont store passwords :[
[07:23:39] <NoiseEee> you should get in the habit of never storing passwords unencrypted
[07:23:45] <Cubud> I cannot have the user sign in every time, it would be too annoying
[07:24:19] <pachet> welcome to the word of crypto handshakes
[07:24:25] <pachet> prepare to be bored to tears
[07:24:34] <shoky> hi im Alice
[07:26:43] <Cubud> okay, SSL it is, thanks :)
[07:29:40] <tronne> e.keyCode is always 0
[07:29:46] <tronne> in a keypress
[07:29:48] <tronne> for me
[07:30:20] * hlvewentcrazy slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[07:30:46] <Jon47> Cubud, i haven't looked into this stuff in years but awhile back it seemed sufficient to:
[07:30:46] <Jon47> 1. randomly generate a "salt" value to append to the users password when it is created
[07:30:46] <Jon47> 2. hash the salted password and store that in the database
[07:30:46] <Jon47> 3. yes, *always* transfer passwords only through SSL
[07:30:46] <Jon47> 4. when user logs in, salt their inputted password and compare it to the hash
[07:31:04] <hlvewentcrazy> ;\
[07:32:05] <Jon47> and pick the biggest meanest one-way algorithm that your system supports as your hash function
[07:32:57] <pachet> sha512 that sumumabitch
[07:32:59] <DerekPioneer> just discovered breakpoints for javascript
[07:33:04] <DerekPioneer> BEST DAY EVER
[07:33:09] <birdpoop> SO i have this flash movie, which i use remove() on when clicking a certain anchor, but the sound keeps playing in IE any solution?
[07:33:29] <mantas322> dont be so cheerful derekpioneer
[07:34:23] <xec_> i agree with mantas322, hold back on the joy, there is too much happiness in this world
[07:35:52] <MacDada> hi! which selector is faster for a click event? '.showlongbutton', '.hidelong .showlongbutton'
[07:36:23] <innociv_> .showlongbutton
[07:36:25] <Jon47> the first one should be faster
[07:36:25] <MacDada> or maybe i should use 'a.showlongbutton' ?
[07:36:33] <johnkpaul> MacDada: the single class selector is faster than two class selectors
[07:36:33] <Jon47> but the second one is more specific
[07:36:36] <johnkpaul> but it really depends on what you need
[07:36:45] <MacDada> i dont need to be more specific
[07:36:49] <SleepyPikachu> Afternoon all
[07:36:57] <pachet> birdpoop: try using .html('') on the movie's parent
[07:37:00] <innociv_> I believe if you cache selectors and use .find() you'll get a lot better speed
[07:37:05] <pachet> i know its functionally the same, but its worked for me before :[
[07:37:12] <MacDada> would a.showlongbutton be faster then just .showlongbutton?
[07:37:16] <xec_> no
[07:37:35] <xec_> MacDada: but don't take my word for it, give jsperf.com a whirl
[07:38:00] <MacDada> ok, thx
[07:38:12] <innociv_> If you have something like var $menu = $('#menu); and do $menu.find('.class') that may be faster than $('.class'), iirc
[07:38:14] <johnkpaul> MacDada: for all but exceptional use cases, you're not going to need to care
[07:38:25] <johnkpaul> unless you have hundreds or thousands of these lookups, don't worry too much
[07:38:49] <Jon47> every "token" in the selector is another iteration that the selector engine needs to run through
[07:39:17] <johnkpaul> innociv_: $('#menu').find('.class') is definitely faster than $('.class', $('#menu'))
[07:39:38] <johnkpaul> I don't know about a global class lookup though, I think the native document.getElementsByClassName would be faster
[07:39:41] <johnkpaul> but again, probably doesn't matter
[07:39:45] <pachet> johnkpaul: it is
[07:40:07] <innociv_> I use a ton of cached selectors and find() in my code just for readability, anyway.
[07:40:12] <pachet> in this case, the specificity of the context would be costing you speed, not gaining. but like johnkpaul said, its very marginal
[07:40:13] <innociv_> And specificity
[07:40:15] <xec_> MacDada: what johnkpaul said. locate your bottlenecks. it's rarely the selectors slowing you down
[07:46:37] <birdpoop> pachet ty so much it works:)
[07:47:09] <mantas322> say im appending an onclick event which sends two variables to a function
[07:47:09] <pachet> birdpoop: no sweat
[07:47:25] <mantas322> how can I escape "
[07:47:29] <pachet> appending an onclick event?
[07:47:31] <pachet> what does that mean
[07:47:36] <mantas322> im running into a " inside ' inside " issue
[07:47:47] <mantas322> $('#exhibitlist').append('<li id="' + item.PM_ID + '" onClick="dothis("hello","goodbye" )" >' + item.PM_TITLE + '</li>');
[07:47:54] <hlvewentcrazy> jqueryception?
[07:47:56] <pachet> mantas322: inline events are bad
[07:48:14] <cybuch> Hello, could anyone recommend me any easy to implement mp3 player ? I've tried jplayer (jplayer.com), but obviously I can't implement it
[07:48:21] <mantas322> is there anyway to escape the inner most ""
[07:48:53] <pachet> var item_to_add = $('<li id="' whatever'">foo</li>').on('click.mynamespace', function(){/*do stuff*/}).appendTo(my_parent)
[07:48:56] <pachet> mantas322^
[07:49:05] <hlvewentcrazy> cybuch, jplayer is easy... did you properly follow all the documentation?
[07:49:10] <pachet> inline onclick events are so 1998
[07:49:30] <cybuch> hlvewentcrazy: Ye, I guess so, I fought with that for 2 hours
[07:49:33] <mantas322> okay thanks for the advice
[07:49:44] <mantas322> I'll be back
[07:49:49] <mantas322> with more confusion shortly
[07:50:58] <hlvewentcrazy> cybuch; try a different plugin, maybe.
[07:50:59] <hlvewentcrazy> http://devreactor.com/projects/drplayer.aspx
[07:51:09] <cybuch> hlvewentcrazy: thanks
[07:51:11] <hlvewentcrazy> http://www.sean-o.com/jquery/jmp3/
[07:53:14] <cybuch> 404 for drplayer and the sean-o's isn't proper for my requirements i guess
[07:54:57] <cybuch> hlvewentcrazy: could you look maybe at my code, so you could tell me what I did wrong with the jplayer?
[07:56:39] * BrixSat grrrrrrrrrr async calls is so mad to retrieve data :@
[07:57:12] <hlvewentcrazy> ?demo cybuch
[07:57:16] <tgodar> anyone have an alternate link for the theme css, getting 404s
[07:57:22] <hlvewentcrazy> where the fuck is bot-t. >:/
[07:58:09] <pachet> he had to go look at an apartment
[07:58:42] <tgodar> eg. http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.20/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[07:59:25] <cybuch> hlvewentcrazy: so?
[08:00:34] <hlvewentcrazy> cybuch, link
[08:00:38] <cybuch> ok
[08:00:46] <cybuch> I'll upload it, w8 a sec please
[08:01:28] <johnline> $('.fade1s').each(function (i) {var $item = $(this);setTimeout(function() {$item.delay(1000).animate({'opacity': 1}, 1000);}, 100*i);});
[08:01:38] <mantas322> this works great, thanks pachet
[08:01:43] <johnline> is there a way to write this better, without using a .delay() ?
[08:01:51] <mantas322> you must be the jquery guy around here
[08:02:18] <pachet> mantas322: im not
[08:02:22] <hlvewentcrazy> shoky is the jquery wizard
[08:02:24] <pachet> i actually dont really use jquery that much personally
[08:02:25] <tgodar> sigh.  really?  No working links to the freaking query themes?
[08:02:29] <pachet> i just come here when #javascript is dead
[08:02:53] <mantas322> i know i've seen you in javascript
[08:02:56] <pachet> johnline: why not just add 1000 to your setTimeout time? :[
[08:03:10] <johnline> i was thinking about using set timeout
[08:03:14] <johnline> just dont know where to add
[08:03:51] <johnline> this little piece of code fades elements in successively, like a mexican wave
[08:05:17] * mantas322  looks up "mexican wave"
[08:06:50] <the_hack> hi guys I am using jquery.qrcode to dynamically create a qrcode in a div, when a new code it created, i want it to replace the last one, but the library uses appendTo. is there an alternative to appendTo which means 'replace contents with'
[08:07:08] <johnkpaul> ?replaceWith
[08:07:08] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .replaceWith(): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[08:07:09] <johnkpaul> @ the_hack
[08:07:51] <cybuch> hlvewentcrazy: OMG. it works, since I've uploaded in on web server
[08:08:05] <cybuch> any idea, why it wouldn't work on localhost?
[08:08:10] <JAAulde> johnkpaul, mantas322: "Let me ask you, is there a term besides 'Mexican' that you prefer? Something less offensive?" --Michael Scott
[08:08:29] <the_hack> caniuse: but doesn't that replace the element itself, not just it's contents?
[08:08:29] <mantas322> hahaha!
[08:08:36] <d3f4ultr0> someone yesterday sent me this splash demo. Forgot who he was. How can we prevent the splash screen from displaying again once I refresh the webpage? http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/11/apple-style-splash-screen-jquery/
[08:08:51] <Jon47> I think in America we just call that "The Wave"
[08:08:56] <johnkpaul> ?html @ caniuse
[08:08:57] <caniuse> caniuse: .html(): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:08:58] <pachet> johnline: var set=$('.fade1s'), length=set.length; function mexican_wave(){set.eq(--length).delay(1000).animate({opacity:1},1000); if ( length ){setTimeout(mexican_wave, 100);}} setTimeout(mexican_wave, 100);
[08:09:04] <johnkpaul> ?html @ the_hack
[08:09:05] <caniuse> the_hack: .html(): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:09:07] <pachet> johnline: $('.fade1s').each(function(i){setTimeout($.proxy(function(){$(this).animate({opacity:1},1000);},this), (100*i)+1000);});
[08:09:08] <mantas322> we american are very sensetive to offensive words
[08:09:14] <johnkpaul> the_hack: caniuse is a bot
[08:09:32] <the_hack> johnkpaul: ha ha thanks!
[08:09:40] <johnkpaul> no problem
[08:09:46] <d3f4ultr0> is there a variable that can be used say value of 1 to display it only 1 time until browser is closed and restarted?
[08:10:16] <Jon47> d3f4ultr0: two options would be localStorage or cookies
[08:10:45] <johnkpaul> Jon47: sessionstorage
[08:10:52] <johnkpaul> localstorage is persistent
[08:11:01] <pachet> whats the purpose of this? might help tailor our answer
[08:11:04] <SleepyPikachu> Hello
[08:11:10] <SleepyPikachu> I'm struggling to make this guide work: http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial
[08:11:12] <the_hack> johnkpaul: i guess I am looking for the opposite of .html the way .appendTo is the opposite of .append.
[08:11:38] <Jon47> johnkpaul: whoa, never knew about that!
[08:11:47] <Jon47> another tool in the toolbelt :)
[08:11:53] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:12:05] <mantas322> okay another stupid question
[08:12:10] <mantas322> so Im doing this over and over again
[08:12:13] <mantas322> $('#exhib_title').append("   "+id+"   "+title);
[08:12:24] <the_hack> johnkpaul: if it existed, I guess it would be called .htmlOf
[08:12:27] <mantas322> however I need to clear out #exhibit_title
[08:12:36] <pachet> the_hack: what :[
[08:12:44] <mantas322> I tried $('#exhib_title').clear();
[08:12:47] <pachet> html() fetches the value if called with no arguments
[08:12:58] <johnkpaul> the_hack: I don't think the jquery api has what you're looking for exactly
[08:13:01] <mantas322> is there some kind of documentation as to what types of methods i can use?
[08:13:03] <johnkpaul> mantas322: .html("")
[08:13:17] <pachet> mantas322: $(foo).empty()
[08:13:22] <the_hack> pachet: I'm setting, not getting
[08:13:32] <pachet> the_hack: then what's wrong with .html()?
[08:13:41] <johnkpaul> pachet: he wants it backwards
[08:13:44] <johnkpaul> appendTo vs append
[08:13:51] <pachet> i dont understand what the backwards of setting is
[08:13:54] <pachet> if its not getting
[08:14:22] <johnkpaul> rather than $(foo).html("new html") he wants $("new html").putInto(foo)
[08:14:33] <the_hack> pachet: not the backwards of setting, reversing the subect and the object
[08:14:53] <pachet> oh :[
[08:14:58] <the_hack> I guess I'll have to come at it another way.
[08:15:01] <mantas322> Thanks johnkpaul and pachet     both of your suggestions work
[08:15:13] <johnkpaul> np
[08:15:14] <the_hack> THanks
[08:16:19] <pachet> $.fn.htmlOf = function(item){var elem = $(this); item.each(function(){$(this).html(elem);}); return elem;};
[08:16:32] <pachet> kind of goofy :[
[08:16:49] <pachet> and you'd probably want to shallow clone the nodes anyway
[08:17:16] <the_hack> pachet: it's because I'm trying to make the library fit dynamically creating the codes, which is not how it's set up
[08:17:19] <pachet> and 'return elem' should be 'return this;'
[08:17:59] <mantas322> okay!\
[08:18:03] <mantas322> great...
[08:18:11] <mantas322> now I need a jquery fileupload control
[08:18:15] <the_hack> pachet: thanks, I might use that.
[08:20:26] <SleepyPikachu> Anyone  see anything obviously wrong with this - http://pastebin.com/MRryzKWE ?
[08:21:21] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: what incorrect behavior of that code are you seeing?
[08:21:51] <johnkpaul> my only comment is that you should use $jQuery(this).find("ul") rather than the context parameer
[08:22:40] <SleepyPikachu> $jQuery(this).find("ul").slideup(100); for example?
[08:23:01] <SleepyPikachu> and it's not functioning at all in answer to your question
[08:23:24] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: yes, and not functioning at all doesn't really give us much to go on
[08:23:26] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ SleepyPikachu
[08:23:40] <SleepyPikachu> neumino_: why are you vpning?
[08:23:49] <SleepyPikachu> and sure one second
[08:23:52] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: do you want it to search up the dom tree or down the tree
[08:24:07] <SleepyPikachu> I don't understand the question
[08:24:14] <SleepyPikachu> www.edesix.com (the top menu is a ul)
[08:24:17] <shoky> i mean, do you want to get the containing <ul> of the <li> that is hovered over?
[08:24:21] <Cubud> Thanks for your help!
[08:24:37] <SleepyPikachu> I want the ul inside the li
[08:24:41] <shoky> ah k
[08:24:53] <shoky> so down the tree ;p
[08:24:58] <SleepyPikachu> so <ul><li><innerul><innerli>

[08:26:44] <johnkpaul> context switching you know
[08:26:58] <johnkpaul> HappyPikachu: you have js errors
[08:27:03] <johnkpaul> did you take a look in your console?
[08:27:07] <HappyPikachu> I did indeed
[08:27:11] <johnkpaul> that javascript never runs

[08:29:23] <HappyPikachu> The errors are not in the javascript I'm attempting to run
[08:29:40] <HappyPikachu> johnkpaul: are you saying that the javascript halts at the first error?
[08:29:47] <johnkpaul> sure, they're somewhere else, but the js interperter stops when there's a js error that's un caught
[08:29:56] <johnkpaul> HappyPikachu: yes, that's how most programming languages work
[08:30:50] <HappyPikachu> johnkpaul: I'm aware, I don't consider javascript to be a programming language and I have an example of a page with these errors where there is javascripting happening anyway
[08:31:24] <shoky> you don't consider it to be a programming language?
[08:31:26] <johnkpaul> HappyPikachu: perhaps they are in a different order on the page then
[08:31:38] <johnkpaul> shoky: apparently not, it's just a "scripting" language
[08:31:53] <shoky> this makes me a sad panda
[08:32:03] <HappyPikachu> shoky: It's challenging when I was weaned on more powerful languages
[08:32:06] <johnkpaul> :) if only we had that sarcasm punctuation
[08:32:14] <johnkpaul> I'm not taking this bait
[08:32:18] <shoky> HappyPikachu: sorry but that just means you don't know the language
[08:32:25] <johnkpaul> shoky: don't take the bait either
[08:32:31] <shoky> heh
[08:32:35] <shoky> good advice
[08:32:37] <HappyPikachu> shoky: Oh agreed, In truth I'm probably just too weak :P
[08:32:54] <HappyPikachu> shoky: I've tried to jump in at the deep end without learning it
[08:32:55] <mantas322> i need more coffee
[08:32:56] <pachet> much you have learned today, grasshopper
[08:33:07] <johnline> thanks pachet i'll try use these
[08:33:10] <shoky> knowing that you're weak is one of the greatest strength
[08:33:17] <mantas322> nothing wrong with that happypika
[08:33:17] <shoky> maybe someone famous said that or something..
[08:33:27] <shoky> strengths*
[08:33:28] <HappyPikachu> shoky: Pokemon probably said that...
[08:33:33] <shoky> LOL
[08:33:37] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy plugin that will take in a hex color and let me grab the brightness of it, ie HSL elements (one or all)? or manipulate colors by adding a certain H,S,L delta to it? I noticed the 'colors' plugin by enideo, but this doesn't seem to do what I'm wanting
[08:34:04] <snover> dojo has a Color module that does that
[08:34:37] <shoky> jkp btw dont worry about the sarcasm punctuation, i can sense it when i see it :) i was sad because of the implications :P
[08:34:58] <johnkpaul> shoky: ah ok, that makes me feel better ;)
[08:35:01] <shoky> ;D
[08:35:19] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: are you just wanting the L of HSL?
[08:35:28] <mantas322> so I have div with data-role=pages    and im showing one and higing the other
[08:35:34] <mantas322> however one of my pages contains a <button onclick="dothis()">A button element</button>
[08:35:40] * shoky higes
[08:35:42] <SleepyPikachu> .5(max(r,g,b) + min(r,g.b)) = L
[08:35:46] <mantas322> and in IE it bleeds through all the pages
[08:35:46] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, yes, i can figure out the math, but it would be nice to find a library that let me tweak any of the color elements
[08:36:02] <pachet> mantas322: what did i say about inline events :[
[08:36:11] <pachet> you're already including jquery, leverage it!
[08:36:12] <mantas322> :<   im just testing
[08:36:14] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: You appear to have omitted the s of 'maths' ;)
[08:38:19] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, I thought this was a math lesson not a spelling lesson.... besides, I've always seen the shortened word singular and that implying both singular and plural.
[08:39:01] <mantas322> who cares about plurality these days anyways
[08:39:24] <mantas322> both of my foot is injured and my entire rowe of tooth is broked.
[08:39:32] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: I was teasing :-), In the UK we say Maths there's no real reason why...
[08:40:06] <johnline> i can grammar for the new house that baby tidy up it!
[08:40:16] <pachet> its largely colloquial whether to say math or maths
[08:40:20] <pachet> in the states most people say math
[08:40:52] <johnline> since it ends with 'th' half the time you cant hear if they use an S
[08:41:02] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, yes, I imagined you were a brit..... go play with your colours
[08:41:31] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: Careful not to fall into that dumpster next to the sidewalk ^^
[08:41:41] <pachet> thats no dumpster
[08:41:45] <mantas322> he brought some tea up to his flat using the lift.
[08:41:45] <jenia> hello everyone. i need to give a call back function to the datepicker
[08:41:48] <pachet> thats the RNC local hq
[08:41:49] <pachet> HIYO
[08:41:51] <jenia> i;m doing it like this:
[08:41:52] <jenia>   $(document).ready(function() {
[08:41:52] <jenia>     $("#date_picker").datepicker();
[08:41:52] <jenia> $('#date_picker').datepicker({
[08:41:52] <jenia>     onSelect: function(dateText, inst) {
[08:41:52] <jenia>       var bla=0;
[08:41:56] <jenia>     }
[08:41:58] <jenia> });
[08:41:59] <thinkt4nk> dude
[08:42:00] <pachet> jenia: please dont paste in the channel
[08:42:00] <jenia>   });
[08:42:00] <thinkt4nk> stop
[08:42:01] <caniuse> thinkt4nk: http://i.imgur.com/XOUfd.png
[08:42:06] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, I dont get it
[08:42:52] <jenia> okay. but since its already pasted, can someone please tell me what am i doing wrong there? the call back does not seems to be executing ( i'm putting a break there and its not triggered)
[08:42:55] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: We find it confusing when American English contains words for which words all ready existed like 'Dumpster' and 'Sidewalk'
[08:43:17] <SleepyPikachu> I just broke 100 gigs on my Fedora 17 DVD Seed \0/
[08:43:31] <jenia> what is side walk in british english?
[08:43:34] <pachet> jenia: why do you call .datepicker twice
[08:43:37] <SleepyPikachu> Pavement
[08:43:51] <jenia> and the pavement on the road?
[08:44:03] <SleepyPikachu> that's not pavement that's road XD
[08:44:11] <pachet> what is the material that makes up the road
[08:44:14] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, so you call the concrete stuff you walk on alongside the road the 'pavement'?
[08:44:15] <pachet> because a road can be a dirt road
[08:44:17] <pachet> or a gravel road
[08:44:25] <SleepyPikachu> tomasm-: correct
[08:45:29] <SleepyPikachu> pachet: the way you just did is how we handle those situations
[08:45:31] <jenia> a road can have any pavement as can have a side walk (brick, tile, gravel...) but a side walk is very clear. at least that my understanding ;)
[08:45:37] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, that's silly.... I'd imagine I'd need a dictionary if I ever visited
[08:46:00] <SleepyPikachu> the pavement is generally made of paving stones
[08:46:23] <pachet> in the us, pavement is usually used to mean whats left after asphalt dries
[08:46:46] <shoky> jenia++
[08:46:49] <tomasm-> "pavement" usually refers to asphalt out here, ie "blacktop" - for parking lots, etc
[08:46:59] <SleepyPikachu> pachet: I'm aware - bastardisation of the word though
[08:47:08] <pachet> i guess asphalt actually cools though, not dries
[08:47:18] <johnline> how can one adopt the english language and then complain to the english 'you're doing it wrong'
[08:47:38] <jenia> so how should i do it pachet?
[08:47:56] <SleepyPikachu> Well in fairness we didn't tell you about the changes to the words that I find most annoying
[08:47:58] <shoky> johnline: languages can't be changed/improved upon ?
[08:47:59] <gehsekky> british english is so amusing
[08:48:09] <jenia> when i put the call back inside the constructior ( the onSelect: ....) i get a fault:
[08:48:15] <SleepyPikachu> which are words Americans mispronounce
[08:48:54] <johnline> they can, but dont complain when the originators dont adopt these changes
[08:49:12] <shoky> jenia: just delete the first line with the .datepicker();
[08:49:33] <pachet> ^
[08:49:33] <SleepyPikachu> Mirror is often wrongly said 'Meeroar'
[08:49:46] <johnline> tomayto
[08:49:52] <SleepyPikachu> and Aluminium is often wrongly said 'Aloominum'
[08:50:11] <johnline> the clue for pronouncing aluminium is in the spelling
[08:50:14] <jcDesigns> hi all, can someone help me with a load() question?
[08:50:27] <jenia> then i get this fault: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[08:50:43] <jenia> on the line where it says: onSelect:
[08:50:45] <shoky> jenia: www.pastebin.com
[08:50:55] <tomasm-> SleepyPikachu, well americans are a mixture of many european cultures and a lot of the word differences are probably relating to direct translations of idiom-type words from other languages or developments/inventions after america was established... we didn't exactly double check with the english before we decided to make up a new word, just so we use the same one.
[08:51:12] <orentanay> If I have a collection of elemenets, and I'm looping through them w/ a .each statement, is there a way to reference that same selection set from within the .each, minus the current element .each is acting upon? Thanks.
[08:51:22] <Misterno> does anyone know a workaround to increasing font size in Skype?
[08:51:30] <johnline> still using the imperial system though
[08:51:49] <jenia> http://pastebin.com/uuScsWcj
[08:51:52] * NodeX note to self, jquery cannot animate to display:none on IE7/8 lol
[08:51:57] <shoky> also americans have always wanted to distance themselves from their imperial heritage
[08:51:58] <jenia> but i can already see, ive got a syntax error
[08:52:01] <shoky> rightly so
[08:52:16] <johnline> except when it comes to measuring things lol
[08:52:17] <jenia> hehe. but i cant figure out the correct way of putting the bracket
[08:52:18] <jenia> s
[08:52:21] <johnkpaul> NodeX: by definition, you can't animate a boolean property
[08:52:25] <shoky> jenia you forgot the opening {
[08:52:26] <jcDesigns> I have a click event that triggers .load('myhtml.html #myDiv') - when that gets loaded scripts dont work anymore. Help?
[08:52:32] <shoky> ah and the closing one
[08:52:36] <johnkpaul> you can animate the opacity and then set it to display none afterwards
[08:52:47] <NodeX> strange how chrome / firefox don't have a problem with it though johnkpaul
[08:52:52] <pachet> orentanay: i would advise just storing the result to a variable, eg var foo = $('.foo'); foo.each(function(){/*do stuff with foo*/})
[08:53:06] <shoky> jenia:  $('#date_picker').datepicker( { onSelect: function(...){...} } );
[08:53:14] <johnkpaul> NodeX: you're doing $().animate({display:'none'})
[08:53:16] <johnkpaul> ?
[08:53:24] <NodeX> yep
[08:53:29] <NodeX> I dont need advice
[08:53:32] <NodeX> it was note to self
[08:53:34] <jenia> wow, this is really some syntax hehe. thanks shoky
[08:53:42] <pachet> what there is actually animatable
[08:53:48] <NodeX> not on it's own opbvisouly
[08:53:53] <orentanay> thanks pachet, that's what I was thinking of using, but I thought maybe jQuery had a neat trick for that, but this works.
[08:53:57] <shoky> jenia: it's regular javascript syntax. learn it ;)
[08:53:59] <SleepyPikachu> I fixed my errors ^^
[08:54:05] <SleepyPikachu> still no menu :-(
[08:54:08] <shoky> jenia: and just follow the docs
[08:54:53] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: feel like taking another look less the errors?
[08:55:07] <jcDesigns> anyone?
[08:55:07] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: link?
[08:55:17] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: www.edesix.com
[08:55:19] <johnkpaul> ask, don't ask to ask, jcDesigns
[08:55:39] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: I still see errors
[08:55:40] <shoky> he asked a few min ago
[08:55:44] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getElementsByTagName' of null
[08:55:51] <SleepyPikachu> LIES
[08:55:53] <shoky> to his defense
[08:55:53] <SleepyPikachu> ok...
[08:55:57] <shoky> and jkp's offense
[08:55:58] <jcDesigns> i did ask: I have a click event that triggers .load('myhtml.html #myDiv') - when that gets loaded scripts dont work anymore.
[08:56:00] <johnkpaul> oh, sorry, I didn't see it jcDesigns
[08:56:06] <shoky> no i will squish U !
[08:56:08] <jcDesigns> no prob, thans shoky
[08:56:12] <johnkpaul> sorry, didn't read scrollback correctly
[08:56:23] <johnkpaul> jcDesigns: do you have script tags inside myhtml.html?
[08:56:32] <johnkpaul> have you checked your console for any errors caused by those scripts?
[08:56:33] <jcDesigns> no
[08:57:09] <jcDesigns> no errors. load happens fine, just nothing fires after the load, like other click events
[08:57:44] <shoky>  If .load() is called with a selector expression appended to the URL, however, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, and thus are not executed.
[08:57:54] <johnkpaul> jcDesigns: can we get a demo?
[08:58:15] <hlvewentcrazy> i hope i'm okay...
[08:58:18] <rosieres> Im handling around with ajax. Sometimes it is neccesary to react on a anchor link, but my ajax is alsready an anchor ... how can I remove the second anchor and put it in right place so that the second anchor is used fr the content ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/KvHpT/
[08:59:13] <jcDesigns> they are stripped out of the base html file that is getting crap loaded into?
[08:59:23] <evasivx> hey guys, can someone help me out? I'm trying to figure out why the this dropline navigation screws up and doesn't display if you roll over it a few times fast. Any suggestions for a total noob?
[08:59:24] <evasivx> http://projectomni.com/granite/
[08:59:42] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=392
[08:59:44] <evasivx> script it: http://projectomni.com/granite/templates/granite/js/droplinemenu.js
[08:59:53] <scalamago> I'm trying to do this  $(this).next().show(); but make it something like this: $('.add-form', this.next()).show(); --- how do you do this in a yii framework?
[08:59:55] <SleepyPikachu> I'll worry about pages that don't use the script in a minute
[09:00:14] <LarryLv> Hey, guys. I have a question. Can i get the content inside the script tag? like <script id="foo">bar</script>
[09:01:06] <shoky> rosieres: didnt understand your question
[09:01:30] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: that page has errors too
[09:01:30] <shoky> jcDesigns: no, not from the original html
[09:01:36] <johnkpaul> do you not look at your js console, SleepyPikachu?
[09:01:42] <SleepyPikachu> I do...
[09:01:51] <shoky> jcDesigns: ah sorry i misread what you said i think
[09:01:57] <SleepyPikachu> I only see warnings johnkpaul
[09:02:19] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: Uncaught ReferenceError: turnpage is not defined
[09:02:27] <SleepyPikachu> new link?
[09:02:28] <SleepyPikachu> http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=392
[09:02:55] <shoky> jcDesigns: click events on a certain element worked before the .load() , but after the .load() clicks on the same element dont work?
[09:03:49] <jcDesigns> click events on elements from the load don't work
[09:03:56] <shoky> right, why would they ?
[09:04:13] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: is that on the new link? http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=392
[09:04:30] <jcDesigns> im not overly advanced. that is what i am asking, why? and how do i get it to work?
[09:04:38] <shoky> jcDesigns you probably want to read about .on() w- about event delegation
[09:05:10] <rosieres> shoky: if I press a link you normally get an anhor for the ajax call like #mycalled_page but sometimes I have links where an anchor is appended and therefore it looks like #my_other_called_page/subpage#sillycontent . . . this is going into trouble as I append and /ajax to every link to call the right content  so I think  the anchor before /ajax must be cut and used in other place
[09:05:58] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: yes
[09:06:00] <johnkpaul> new link has the error
[09:06:17] <pachet> jcDesigns: basically, the elements you're expecting to work a certain way when clicked dont exist when you bind the click handler using a selector
[09:06:17] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: do a hard refresh?
[09:06:44] <pachet> jcDesigns: they're only added after the fact, and well past the point in the control flow where any handlers are assigned
[09:07:03] <pachet> jcDesigns: enter .on with delegation, as shoky sagaciously mentioned
[09:08:19] <shoky> rosieres: sorry ive been trying to understand what you said for 3 min now
[09:08:37] <shoky> rosieres: and its not going well
[09:08:41] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: did that fix the errors?
[09:08:47] <rosieres> shoky: mhh .... ill try it again . . .
[09:08:47] <shoky> but i need to drink.
[09:08:55] <shoky> & eat
[09:12:20] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: yes, it did
[09:12:27] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: there are no uls
[09:12:31] <rosieres> shoky: I open my page -> my.domain.com  | I press a link  -> my.domain.com/subpage1 | The link is converted and goes to my.domain.com/subpage1/ajax --- the hash is changed to my.domain.com#subpage1 | Now comes the but: A link with an anchor in it my.domain.com/subpage1#somestubidcontent  .... this is going to messed up
[09:12:46] <johnkpaul> $jQuery('ul', this) returns an empty jquery object
[09:13:09] <johnkpaul> ther eis no ul underneath menu-item-13, also you should use $(this).find('ul')
[09:13:27] <shoky> evasivx: i didnt throughly go through your code, but, you might need/want to bind to the mouseover/mouseout events instead of using .hover(...)
[09:13:49] <shoky> evasivx: read about it here and look at the demo at the bottom  http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[09:13:52] <johnline> my backend is talking to my frontend
[09:13:54] <johnline> it smells
[09:13:57] <SleepyPikachu> hmmm
[09:13:58] <SleepyPikachu> one second
[09:14:32] <evasivx> shoky, unfortunatly i just used that as a premade script from the internet, like i said, i'm a jquery noob. I understand what you're trying to say but i don't think i'm going to be able to do it myself haha. Thanks for the info tho!
[09:14:47] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: you don't see this? http://pastebin.com/wPujB7S8
[09:15:03] <jcDesigns> shiz, got it. I was using on/delegation, unforntunately not on elements that were there apparently
[09:15:11] <jcDesigns> thank shoky, and pachet
[09:15:13] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: I do, but there is no ul inside the li
[09:15:19] <shoky> evasivx: k it's just a hunch anyway i donno if that's the issue
[09:15:32] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: your code is searching for all ul's underneath the li and animating them
[09:15:42] <SleepyPikachu> correct
[09:16:05] <SleepyPikachu> So I have a big ul
[09:16:07] <johnkpaul> but in your code example, there are no ul's underneath the li
[09:16:22] <SleepyPikachu> and then the <li> which contains the word products
[09:16:39] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: I am confused about what you're trying to do
[09:16:40] <SleepyPikachu> there is a ul containing only one li
[09:16:48] <johnkpaul> but that's not what you're searching for to animate
[09:16:58] <johnkpaul> $('ul',this) searches for all ul's below the li
[09:17:00] <johnkpaul> and there are none
[09:18:08] <SleepyPikachu> this is a simplified version of the structure http://pastebin.com/tgLc4TyZ
[09:18:16] <SleepyPikachu> without the wordpress guff on the styles
[09:19:40] <shoky> rosieres: what do you mean the link is converted?   and why if the link is to a #hash does that mess things up ?
[09:21:02] <whatthepoop> given an jquery object already selected and cached (as '$form'), and given a separate plain javascript array of element IDs known to be within that form ( myArray = [ '#first_name', '#last_name' ] ), how would I iterate through each of those elements? this is what I've been working with (unsuccessfully): $form.find(myArray).each(function () { ... });
[09:21:04] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: I've changed the jquery code as advised
[09:23:51] <shoky> whatthepoop: $form.find( myArray.join() ).each( ... )
[09:24:00] <Haprog> whatthepoop: I think something like this might do it $.each(myArray, function(index, value){ $form.find(value).dostuff... })
[09:24:27] <whatthepoop> you guys are the best.. thanks, I'll try both
[09:24:36] <shoky> ;]
[09:24:49] <Haprog> you could use join like shoky showed but I think you ned to join by comma
[09:24:56] <shoky> comma is default
[09:24:58] <rosieres> shoky: converted means /ajax is appended . . . I use this to call a certain page without any html head and body ....  And it messes things up when I do a ( what probably at the moment is happening ) my.domain.com/subpage1#somestubidcontent/ajax  | I need to remove the #somestubidcontent I think . . .
[09:25:03] <Haprog> oh is it?
[09:25:07] <shoky> think so
[09:25:16] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: none of your li's have ul's underneath
[09:25:18] <johnkpaul> check your html
[09:25:21] <Haprog> i*d guess default was no separator :P
[09:25:32] <shoky> separator
[09:25:32] <shoky> Specifies a string to separate each element of the array. The separator is converted to a string if necessary. If omitted, the array elements are separated with a comma.
[09:25:44] <Haprog> ok, nice
[09:26:55] <SleepyPikachu> I just did - http://imagebin.org/214619
[09:28:10] <shoky> rosieres: then you just need to fix your 'conversion' so that it gives the url you want, no ?
[09:28:16] <whatthepoop> shoky & Haprog: yep, thanks again, that array.join() did the trick.. looks like the second solution would work similarly, but it's working now so weee! thanks guys!
[09:28:31] <shoky> ;]

[09:29:09] <demetan> how to stop a jquery function in a javascript function  ?
[09:29:16] <shoky> LoL
[09:29:22] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: mhmm?
[09:29:25] <Haprog> jQuery IS JavaScript and you don't stop functions
[09:29:30] <shoky> that wins weird question of the week
[09:29:34] <johnkpaul> haha
[09:29:45] <johnkpaul> demetan: you're going to need to explain a little more
[09:29:46] <rosieres> shoky: no ;-) I need to strip the #stubidcontent and paste it after ajax like this /ajax#mystubidcontent
[09:30:04] <shoky> rosieres: ok.... so why not do that :(
[09:30:06] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: Right copied from the source of the page: http://pastebin.com/S8GGC6xP
[09:30:11] <SleepyPikachu> A ul inside an li
[09:30:15] <SleepyPikachu> is that not under?
[09:30:46] <shoky> rosieres: sry i'll bbs. pastebin or jsfiddle some code and post it here in the meanwhile
[09:31:01] <johnkpaul> oh, SleepyPikachu, it works for me now
[09:31:06] <johnkpaul> you added that
[09:31:12] <SleepyPikachu> *facepalm* - no I didnt.
[09:31:26] <johnkpaul> or maybew we're using different pages?
[09:31:29] <rosieres> shoky: I was all the time on the *rrrrooonggg search for the problem . . .  now with writing to you I found what is happening and try to fix it now . . .ill post something . .
[09:31:33] <johnkpaul> anyway, what issue are you having now, I see the menu drop down
[09:31:47] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: http://www.edesix.com/?page_id=392
[09:32:23] <SleepyPikachu> anyway when you say it works for you do you mean you see a sub-menu?
[09:33:12] <demetan> johnkpaul: please see http://pastebin.com/AKF44pg5
[09:33:14] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: could you screenshot this for me?
[09:34:37] <johnkpaul> demetan: look into the javascript returns tatement
[09:36:01] <demetan> how please
[09:36:11] <SleepyPikachu> jkp, would you mind screenshoting?
[09:36:19] <SleepyPikachu> shooting*
[09:36:19] <jonah> hi does anyone know of a way to hide the arrows at the start or end of jcarousel when  they don't do anything if clicked please? I can't find resources or docs on how to do this... do you think it's possible?
[09:36:23] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: http://i.imgur.com/TjYyq.png
[09:36:35] <johnkpaul> demetan: have you used javascript before?
[09:36:53] <demetan> ;-)
[09:37:13] <johnkpaul> jonah: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/#Accessing-The-Jcarousel-Instance you can use one of those callbacks I believe
[09:37:21] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: The thing that says videobadge, VideoManager ... Accessories is not the sub-menu I'm trying to show - is this sometimes hidden?
[09:37:33] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: yes, it is hidden until I move my mouse over products
[09:37:38] <jonah> johnkpaul: thanks very much, i'll take a look
[09:37:47] <SleepyPikachu> *facepalm* that's not the sub menu 0.o
[09:37:50] <johnkpaul> jonah: no problem
[09:38:11] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: It's not even a list based menu!
[09:38:24] <johnkpaul> :/ I don't know SleepyPikachu
[09:38:30] <psyolus> Is there any easy way to have jquery dialogs not stack on top of eachother when they are created? Maybe ever so slightly not overlap like cards on a table?
[09:38:39] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: browser/os combo?
[09:38:39] <psyolus> s/easy way/standard way/
[09:38:51] <johnkpaul> chrome 19 osx lion, SleepyPikachu
[09:39:10] <SleepyPikachu> grumble grumble grumble - have to power up vm...
[09:39:38] <johnkpaul> osx vm?
[09:40:36] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: Yes
[09:42:10] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: I don't get this behaviour under OSX Chrome 19
[09:42:16] <SleepyPikachu> or any other browser
[09:42:38] <shoky> allz i had to do to get xcode to agree to install was set my osx system date a year back
[09:42:44] <SleepyPikachu> could you try a hard refresh for me, ctrl-f5?
[09:42:48] <shoky> @vm
[09:44:29] <tamm0> hi there :)
[09:45:30] <evasivx> hi!
[09:47:46] <SleepyPikachu> SleepyPikachu fainted!
[09:48:22] <johnline> dear god
[09:48:27] <SleepyPikachu> (My machine fell over)
[09:49:33] <johnline> just had to explain over the phone to two letards how to adjust their display settings for a widescreen projector
[09:49:49] <johnline> at one point she just restarted the computer no rhyme or reason
[09:50:50] <tamm0> i'm using the ajax-form plugin by malsup for uploads. is there a chance to get the upload-bitrate-speed displayed? anyone has experiences?
[09:52:36] <incognit0> Howdy, anyone ever use jQueryUI widget before?
[09:52:50] <tgodar> anyone know how long this has been 404ing or if there is an alternate link for UI themes?
[09:52:52] <tgodar> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.20/themes/ui-darkness/jquery-ui.css
[09:53:26] <incognit0> I have an issue where I'm trying to make a value such as this.DOM.foobar stay relative to each this.element
[09:55:37] <SleepyPikachu> why did you have to explain?
[09:56:28] <johnline> http://assets.scumbagsteve.com/hashed_silo_content/f54/f6b/d88/resized/uses-ie8-uses-internet-explorer-8-a54007.jpg
[09:56:49] * SleepyPikachu doesn't get it
[10:00:32] <zoite> Hi, I'm having an issue with toggleClass, it doesn't seem to be working. http://jsfiddle.net/bA2zx/ - I want it to change arrow styles but it doesn't change
[10:00:59] <orentanay> I have a crazy sceanrio where I can't access the backend code, so everything has to be done via JS/jQuery. I have multiple form Selects, and they all have the same ID, argh! I was able to successfully make a collection of them, and modify their IDs to be unique, but when I attempt to use some JS obj = document.getElementById(tempId); The elements in the collection are still not being seen as
[10:00:59] <orentanay> unique. Any thoughts? thanks.
[10:03:07] <SleepyPikachu> Lots of questions, no answers ;)
[10:03:13] <philsown> hello jquery! what's a good tutorial for learning deferred?
[10:04:02] <tamm0> SleepyPikachu: seems to be the reason for this channel ;)
[10:04:19] <tgodar> SleepyPikachu, word
[10:04:21] <hlvewentcrazy> ' have a crazy sceanrio where I can't access the backend code, so everything has to be done via JS/jQuery.'
[10:04:22] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[10:04:25] <shoky> philsown: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[10:04:27] <philsown> any answer i might provide would probably be wrong :-)
[10:04:31] <hlvewentcrazy> Uhhhhhhhhhh. sketch-town USA.
[10:04:36] <philsown> shoky: yay! thank you
[10:05:24] <shoky> tgodar: you can just download the packed custom download, selecting the theme you want
[10:06:01] <incognit0> Is anyone familiar with $.widget? http://jsfiddle.net/BDG/DwgyB/
[10:06:06] <hlvewentcrazy> orentanay, so... why exactly can't you access any of the 'back-end code'?
[10:06:15] <hlvewentcrazy> Your question was super sketchalicious
[10:06:41] <tgodar> philsown, i sometimes find searching github for s strong of code is a great way to see code examples
[10:07:10] <philsown> tgodar: great idea! thank you!
[10:07:18] <philsown> i'll remember that for any language :-)
[10:07:42] <tgodar> shoky, suppose thats my work around, ill just do that for each theme and copy out the css.  be nice if the sites links worked or that was part of the git repo
[10:08:05] <tgodar> philsown, word.  I learned a lot about PHP's SPL that way
[10:08:56] <shoky> incognit0: i didnt understand what your issue is
[10:09:18] <shoky> tgodar: agreed
[10:10:04] <incognit0> shoky: I'm trying to store a list of DOM elements relative to the element the widget is invoke don.
[10:10:22] <shoky> and it seems you're doing that fine
[10:10:38] <incognit0> shoky: It's destroying #p3, not #p2.
[10:10:45] <shoky> oh
[10:11:03] <incognit0> shoky: It does the same when invoking destroy on any p, or even all P.
[10:11:14] <shoky> kay
[10:15:22] <BriGuy> Hey everyone. So, I've been working on http://www.tryapl.org. It
[10:15:58] <BriGuy> 's one of those sites like tryhaskel or try ruby, and I've run into a bit of a problem
[10:16:46] <BriGuy> We have a language bar which you can click on to insert characters into an imput line
[10:17:37] <BriGuy> but I've run into the well known IE "lose focus from the input line lose caret position"
[10:18:26] <shoky> incognit0: http://jsfiddle.net/DwgyB/1/
[10:18:33] <BriGuy> How do I disable the div that contains my language bar, so a misclick does not steal focus from the text bar?
[10:18:45] <tamm0> zoite: i updated your jsfiddle
[10:19:01] <shoky> (you can ignore the 'i' counter i added)
[10:19:41] <tamm0> zoite: http://jsfiddle.net/bA2zx/8/
[10:20:24] <incognit0> shoky: You're saying there's one object instance for all the widgets?
[10:20:43] <shoky> incognit0: the way you were doing it, yeah, i think
[10:21:31] <shoky> incognit0: the "magic" of the widget factory is that is gives you a magic "this" reference that you can put stuff on relating to that instance of your plugin
[10:21:31] <incognit0> shoky: I should be able to do this.DOM = new this.DOM, maybe...
[10:21:54] <shoky> incognit0: {} == new Object()
[10:21:59] <shoky> or something
[10:22:10] <thinkt4nk> incognit0 the second argument to the widget factory is a prototype.  google prototypal inheritance for more information
[10:23:06] <incognit0> shoky: Yeah, but I have a function inside DOM that uses those properties for other things.
[10:23:54] <incognit0> thinkt4nk: I haven't used $.widget before, I'm familaiar with the prototype chain however.
[10:24:21] <shoky> incognit0: if you want you can create a constructor function for that DOM object
[10:24:26] <thinkt4nk> ok, well keep in mind that the second argument is just a prototype, so properties of that object are shared among the instances
[10:24:31] <incognit0> shoky: That's likely what I'm going to do.
[10:24:40] <shoky> cool ;p
[10:24:42] <incognit0> thinkt4nk: This whole thing is basically <| ?
[10:24:51] <thinkt4nk> that's why, as shoky pointed out, you have to programmatically create instance properties
[10:25:06] <incognit0> Le rage. Le rage avec formage.
[10:25:16] <shoky> je nais
[10:25:33] <shoky> er
[10:25:40] <incognit0> I read the funny manual too. It's a bad manual.
[10:26:04] <incognit0> Alright, well that explains quite a lot. Off to constructor land. Thanks all :)
[10:26:19] <rodd> fiddle doesnt seem to save my fiddles
[10:26:20] <shoky> get me a souvenir
[10:27:02] <incognit0> shoky: Maybe, I'm trying to see if I can release my widgets on github. That'd be cool.
[10:30:03] <shoky> ;]
[10:30:23] <mantas322> window.location.replace(
[10:30:30] <mantas322> what are my alternatives here
[10:30:36] <mantas322> can I do open?
[10:30:40] <mantas322> i can do open right
[10:31:41] <mantas322> i want to open in a new window or tab
[10:32:00] * hlvewentcrazy looks around and sees a crazy man talking to himself
[10:32:14] <mantas322> :>
[10:33:30] <shoky> umm target="_blank"  ?
[10:34:09] <mantas322> i need a nap
[10:38:12] <rosieres> I use indexOf to get a "#" hash. how do I get a second "#" .... the first one is everytime in first place of the string
[10:39:47] <johnkpaul> rosieres: what are you trying to do?
[10:39:53] <johnkpaul> find whatever is after the last #?
[10:40:50] <rosieres> yes . . . I want the last # and the whatever cut and paste it in other place
[10:41:13] <johnkpaul> cut and paste?
[10:41:29] <rosieres> pushing it in a variable :-)
[10:41:56] <johnkpaul> ?eval var orig = "aaslkdjasldj#1123123#lastpart", arr = orig.split("#");arr[arr.length-1]
[10:41:57] <caniuse> johnkpaul: 'lastpart'
[10:41:59] <shoky> rosieres:  .lastIndexOf
[10:42:18] <rosieres> :-))) thx
[10:42:45] <johnkpaul> :) shoky I had no idea that existed
[10:42:48] <shoky> yar and .split is your friend
[10:42:50] <johnkpaul> always learning
[10:42:52] <shoky> :)
[10:43:03] <johnkpaul> ?String.prototype.anchor
[10:43:09] <shoky> there's always a reverse one
[10:43:11] <johnkpaul> ?eval String.prototype.anchor
[10:43:12] <caniuse> johnkpaul: null
[10:43:24] <johnkpaul> that's part of the dom, not in bot
[10:43:44] <shoky> in C it was  strchr (same as indexOf)  and strrchr (same as lastIndexOf)
[10:44:14] <shoky> strchr > indexOf
[10:45:47] <shoky> or strstr & strrstr <3<3
[10:46:10] <johnkpaul> haha
[10:46:11] <shoky> the middle r standing for 'reverse'
[10:46:14] <shoky> i think
[10:46:22] <rosieres> shoky: why should I use split then ? wouldnt substr() be my firend ?
[10:46:33] <shoky> rosieres: they're all your friends
[10:47:05] <rosieres> and how do I get to know whos my best friend ? ;-)
[10:47:06] <johnkpaul> I feel like splitting is more intuitive,
[10:47:06] <shoky> rosieres: but personally to find the last hash i'd use lastIndexOf
[10:47:14] <johnkpaul> rosieres: you can find all of your friends on mdn
[10:47:19] <shoky> lol
[10:47:37] <rosieres> **rroooaarr ;-)
[10:49:00] <shoky> to me lastIndexOf is more intuitive because i know it just means to search the string from the end instead of from the beginning
[10:49:12] <shoky> splitting it would be less efficient
[10:49:35] <shoky> but thats me
[10:49:48] <shoky> er
[10:49:51] <johnkpaul> shoky: efficiency != intuition
[10:49:52] <shoky> nm
[10:50:49] <shoky> johnkpaul: of course, but when you train yourself to write efficiently (or are just aware of what the actual computation is gonna look like) then your intuition changes towards efficiency ;p
[10:51:51] <shoky> "i wanna find the last #" to me translates directly to "ok so i need to search char by char from the end till i reach the #"
[10:52:54] <shoky> anyway i prefixed it all with 'to me' so im clear.
[10:52:54] <gho5t> is using .end() frowned upon by the jQuery gurus?
[10:52:59] <shoky> nope
[10:53:11] <gho5t> is it cleaner to just do a new line after filtering?
[10:53:21] <shoky> they actually use it a lot if you look at the jquery/jquery ui sources ;p
[10:53:24] <gho5t> ah ok
[10:53:35] <gho5t> i feel like it was starting to get a little gross in my code
[10:53:35] <shoky> it depends though..
[10:53:41] <gho5t> especially this .end().end()
[10:53:50] <shoky> ah thats less nice, yeah
[10:53:56] <gho5t> heh
[10:54:07] <shoky> you'll probably be safe sticking to one level nesting
[10:54:14] <shoky> i would
[10:54:31] <shoky> but again, it depends
[10:55:09] <gho5t> all right thanks
[10:55:21] <gho5t> by the way, does JR ever come here
[10:55:23] <gho5t> or are you him?
[10:55:37] <shoky> ok in jquery sources not so much .end()
[10:55:42] <shoky> lol no i am not JR
[10:55:51] <shoky> he's on #jquery-dev though
[10:55:55] <gho5t> oh word?
[10:55:57] <johnkpaul> shoky: I would argue that intuition should not usually follow from performance except in rare situations
[10:56:12] <johnkpaul> if it takes .0000001% more cycles to use .split(), I don't really care
[10:56:21] <johnkpaul> if I need to care, I will know to worry about it
[10:56:37] <shoky> johnkpaul yeah if it's a small url then of course, it doesnt matter at all
[10:57:00] <shoky> and again, i said its more intuitive _to me_. not that that's the best way to tune your programming intuition
[11:02:20] <shoky> OK?!?!?!
[11:02:38] <shoky> are we squish buddies again
[11:03:09] <HardFu> hey I have the following problem: I have three html pages, first one has $.cookie('lvl', 'pro');  second one has $.cookie('lvl', 'privat'); and the last one has console.log($.cookie('lvl'));
[11:03:20] <tamm0> push: i'm using the ajax-form plugin by malsup for uploads. is there a chance to get the upload-bitrate-speed displayed? anyone has experiences?
[11:03:28] <HardFu> If I navigate them in this order, the last console.log gives me 'pro'??
[11:07:48] <shoky> HardFu: check out the 'path' option for $.cookie
[11:09:59] <HardFu> hm, ok now I get null on the third page
[11:10:00] <HardFu> :)
[11:10:04] <safani> hello
[11:10:13] <HardFu> but a valid pointer shoky, I'll do some research, thanx
[11:10:25] <safani> does anyone know of a good room to find info on swfobject
[11:11:03] <safani> I am trying to figure out how to use only one instance of an swf to play media on click, moving the swf to the div I choose onclick.
[11:11:37] <safani> I have destroy the swf and reload it  but I am requesting the file from the srever each time
[11:11:59] <safani> I would like to only request the swf one time, and request only the media after that
[11:13:10] <shoky> sorry HardFu donno actually if that's the issue
[11:14:00] <incognit0> does jQuery have something like DocumentFragment?
[11:14:31] <shoky> it uses them ;S
[11:14:37] <incognit0> I want to return a list of elements as a fragment without being wrapped inside an element.
[11:14:50] <HardFu> shoky: no, it's not
[11:14:55] <incognit0> ie return $("<ele1/>") + $("<ele2/>") ;
[11:15:06] <HardFu> shoky, you can see the example here: www.ifo.dk
[11:15:22] <HardFu> there are two buttons at the top, professionel and privat
[11:15:30] <HardFu> these two pages set cookie
[11:15:45] <HardFu> all other pages on this site have console.log for this var
[11:15:46] <shoky> incognit0:  $('<ele1/>').add( $('<ele2/>') ) works
[11:16:10] <tamm0> safani: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=swfobject+group
[11:16:16] <shoky> er
[11:16:56] <ryez> I have a group of $('p') elements, how to filter out those containing certain keyword case-insenstively?
[11:17:10] <shoky> incognit0 also just:  $(['<ele1/>', '<ele2/>'])
[11:17:58] <aghouseh> im working on a giant beast of a project, and some js is clearing classes/styles of certain elements. is there a way to maybe "watch" an element for a dom change and then pause script execution so i can track where its coming from?
[11:18:13] <shoky> ryez:  $('p').filter( .... )
[11:18:29] <tamm0> ryez: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:18:45] <shoky> contains is case sensitive
[11:19:49] <shoky> ryez: the .... is meant to be a fubction
[11:19:51] <ryez> shoky, tamm0: thanks, but `:contains` can only do case sensitive match
[11:19:53] <shoky> function
[11:20:06] * tw2113 encourages everyone to make shoky their new hero
[11:20:09] <shoky> ryez so create your custom filter function
[11:20:11] <ryez> the doc says, `The text must have matching case to be selected`
[11:20:59] <PilotBob> How do I select the tr prior to this, if it is a tr? So basically prev sibling
[11:21:01] <ryez> ah, found this: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/make-jquery-contains-case-insensitive/
[11:21:27] <rosieres> problem with a if and typeof -> missing : after property -> but I dont get where there should be a : ?? http://jsfiddle.net/gdryQ/1/
[11:21:32] <shoky> heh Contains. nice
[11:23:50] <shoky> rosieres  you put a 'url' property where a statement should be
[11:24:10] <shoky> you mean url = url + '/ajax'  ?
[11:24:48] <rodd> shoky, what's your favorite design pattern?
[11:24:51] <shoky> no you also put a comma
[11:25:06] <shoky> rodd: i dunno..
[11:25:17] <rosieres> shoky: and why does it work flwlessly if i remove the whole if and else ?
[11:25:34] <shoky> rosieres ehhh
[11:25:46] <shoky> you put the 'if'  inside an object
[11:25:52] <rosieres> even with url : url +"/ajax",
[11:25:54] <shoky> not inside a fenction...
[11:25:58] <shoky> ^^
[11:26:02] <shoky> function
[11:26:03] <safani> tamm0 thats classic....
[11:26:21] <rosieres> mhh . .  ok
[11:26:26] <rosieres> thx
[11:26:35] <safani> if I ever find myself in IRC though its because i have Thoroughly searched google.
[11:27:03] <shoky> we're that smelly?
[11:27:06] <safani> and feel i could find better info from a human
[11:29:10] <rosieres> shoky . . . thought i need it as I have the succes:function(html) afterwards
[11:29:22] <tamm0> safani: but this is a jquery chat, not swfobject chat
[11:29:39] <shoky> rosieres you really should take the time to learn javascript...
[11:35:04] <rosieres> shoky: probably yesss !! . . .  how should it be written  ?-> BTW: that would be intuitive to me :-) http://jsfiddle.net/gdryQ/5/
[11:36:28] <shoky> that looks fine..
[11:36:38] <rosieres> ??
[11:36:50] <shoky> the non-commented code..
[11:37:30] <rosieres> ack: but what shall I do with my if else then ?
[11:37:39] <shoky> what is myy ?
[11:37:51] <rosieres> another variable
[11:38:33] <Escherial> hey, this is kind of a strange request, but i have an xml document (yes, i have no choice over this) that i'd like to display alongside a graphical editor for said xml document
[11:38:42] <shoky> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/gdryQ/6/
[11:38:52] <Escherial> (i.e. the entities in the document are interpreted as little editable boxes, etc.)
[11:39:41] <Escherial> creating the editable boxes from xml is pretty easy, but i'd like some way to maintain the association between a section of xml and an entity such that i can, say, highlight the xml entity when the graphical one's selected (and hopefully vice versa, but that might be asking for a lot)
[11:39:52] <rosieres> half understood: why += ?
[11:40:05] <shoky> rosieres:  its the same as:   url = url + "/ajax";
[11:41:10] <rosieres> shoky: thank you for your all time patience and help !!
[11:41:19] <shoky> np
[11:41:55] <shoky> Escherial: for maintaing such an association you just need a reference to the other
[11:42:34] <shoky> thats pretty general i know but so's your question ;p
[11:43:44] <Escherial> this is true; i have a few ideas on how to approach it...forgive me, i've realized that i'm just thinking out loud, heh
[11:43:48] <Escherial> i'll think on paper instead :)
[11:43:55] <shoky> ;]
[11:46:16] <safani> tamm0: you win, your right
[11:46:26] <shoky> safani stay
[11:46:42] <safani> lol
[11:46:44] <shoky> its been a while since you asked, feel free to ask again
[11:46:55] <shoky> and maybe this time someone will see it who knows
[11:47:03] <shoky> and also try ##javascript
[11:47:59] <safani> Its ok I'll figure it out.
[11:48:07] <Escherial> safani: what's the question? :)
[11:49:25] <shoky> swfobject-related
[11:49:48] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/LdaAb/2/  I have 2 dialogs on the same page, but for some reason when I click the 2nd one the checkboxes on that form's dialog doesn't have any values
[11:49:51] <Escherial> i have some limited experience with that
[11:49:54] <safani> I'm making something that will play music, I have 100's of songs.  If all those songs were boxes in a row, when i click on a song, I want it to load the swf.  After that swf is loaded I want to never load it again and only load songs into the swf while simultaneously changing its position to the box i have clicked
[11:50:41] <Escherial> you know that there are off-the-shelf music players for doing specifically what you're asking, right?
[11:50:52] <Escherial> it'd be in a single swf, but you can use it to play your library of songs
[11:51:15] <safani> right, but i dont want the off the shelf player and playlist
[11:51:51] <safani> essentially i would be loading a one song playlist into the player on the click of each box
[11:51:57] <Escherial> maybe look for one that has a scripting interface, so you can make your interface in html/js and control the swf, which could be hidden somewhere
[11:52:03] <Escherial> i see, hrm.
[11:52:14] <safani> right, im using jwplayer and swfobject
[11:52:28] <safani> but I think im on the right track now.
[11:53:43] <safani> oh wait....you just gave an idea though lol!
[11:54:02] <safani> i really dont have to use the player and move it
[11:54:14] <Escherial> safani: oh? :D
[11:54:41] <Escherial> nice, heh; well, i'll let you work it out, and feel free to bounce ideas off of me if you like
[11:54:56] <safani> i could have controls in html that control the boxes and hide the main swf, buttons on the boxes could stop the player
[11:55:05] <safani> thanx for the idea boost
[11:55:46] <jonclark> this isn't jquery-related, but this is the smartest channel -- anyone ever run into mobile css just _not_ loading? is there a common pitfall?
[11:57:10] <Escherial> jonclark: i haven't done a lot of mobile web development, but i assume it depends strongly on the browser...could be a latency issue, where the page starts to render but the includes haven't downloaded yet
[12:16:10] <Validatorian> if I have something like this: $('#dynamicContainer').on('click', '.delegatedClass', function () {}) how can I ensure that multiple click handlers aren't applied to .delegatedClass? I can't .unbind('click') on #dynamicContainer
[12:17:00] <Validatorian> should I just add $(this).unbind('click') in the function?
[12:17:11] <Validatorian> no, that doesn't make sense
[12:18:27] <Validatorian> perhaps .one
[12:19:42] <Azra-el> stupid place to ask this but... anybody working or worked with sencha touch? i am in doubt if i should stick with jqtouch for my phonegap app or give sencha touch a go
[12:23:09] <Validatorian> no, .one isn't what I'm looking for
[12:25:26] <Escherial> Validatorian: why can't you unbind('click')? is it because there are other click handlers associated with it that you need, but you just don't want to bind this particular handler multiple times?
[12:26:26] <Escherial> Validatorian: off() might do what you want: http://api.jquery.com/off/ you can specify the handler that you wish to unbind from the element
[12:26:37] <Escherial> so if you first off(), then on(), you'll be ensured of having that handler bound only once to the entity
[12:27:05] <Escherial> you'll have to create the handler as a non-anonymous function, though, afaik
[12:28:56] <jcromartie> can anybody help me pull the RSS "media:description" element out of a document fragment with jQuery?
[12:29:55] <jcromartie> things that don't work: $item.find("[nodename=media:description]"); $item.find("[nodename=\"media:description\"]"); $item.find("media:description");
[12:30:37] <jcromartie> now, interestingly, $item.find("description") returns BOTH the plain <description> element AND the <media:description> element
[12:30:54] <jcromartie> so maybe I could use that, but it seems rather odd
[12:31:07] <jcromartie> I also can't count on the order of things
[12:34:02] <zackiv31> anyone know why browsers (in my case FF) reload an image already dowloaded if I keep toggling the $('img').attr('src') between two images? shouldn't it download only once for each?
[12:35:47] <jcromartie> zackiv31: is it downloading it, or is it retrieving it from the cache?
[12:35:55] <jcromartie> because swapping out the src will basically "throw away" the old image
[12:36:23] <jcromartie> the way to keep the image around is to keep the element itself, (i.e. use el.detach(), and make sure not to use el.remove())
[12:36:29] <zackiv31> its requesting it from the server again.. I'm seeing the request again in firebug
[12:36:50] <zackiv31> ah.. I was thinking something like that... thanks!
[12:36:53] <jcromartie> well, the first thing is to determine if that's really a problem… cache kind of makes that a non-issue if it's set up correctly
[12:37:41] <jcromartie> so is jQuery really incapable of dealing with XML namespaces?
[12:38:32] <jcromartie> another one that doesn't work: $item.find("media\\:description")
[12:46:17] <jcromartie> so, the backslash escape doesn't work, and neither does [nodename=…] is it my browser
[12:46:18] <jcromartie> ?
[12:46:18] <jcromartie> or what
[12:46:56] <Escherial> jcromartie: can you post up the source file from which you're trying to extract that info?
[12:48:03] <jcromartie> sure here's a feed with media:description http://feeds.nytimes.com/nyt/rss/World
[12:48:28] <johnline> http://i.imgur.com/OzyR6.jpg
[12:49:15] <jcromartie> maybe it's a Content-type problem
[12:49:24] <jcromartie> I just noticed that the server is not giving it a good XML type
[12:49:28] <jcromartie> (on my document)
[12:49:36] <jcromartie> so maybe it thinks it's HTML or something
[12:52:19] <jcromartie> nope, not that
[12:54:22] <shoky> jcromartie: jquery isn't an xml parser
[12:55:08] <jcromartie> it should work in this situation, no?
[12:55:21] <shoky> with namespaces? nope
[12:55:54] <jcromartie> hm
[12:59:30] <jcromartie> well it *almost* works
[12:59:50] <jcromartie> I mean, it can parse everything else about a document except selectors with namespaces
[12:59:59] <jcromartie> it even picks up those namespaced elements if you leave off the namespace
[13:00:59] <danheberden> jcromartie IE doesn't support namespaces in XMLDocument, hence why there's no support in jQ for it
[13:01:10] <danheberden> i'd just write your own
[13:01:27] <jcromartie> my own what?
[13:01:38] <danheberden> implementation to parse the XMLDocument
[13:02:00] <jcromartie> but now what about this… http://stackoverflow.com/questions/853740/jquery-xml-parsing-with-namespaces
[13:02:05] <jcromartie> see "The better solution does not require escaping and works on all "modern" browsers:"
[13:02:12] <jcromartie> which says it's .find("[nodeName=z:row]")
[13:02:55] <danheberden> so if it works for you then you're fine, ya?
[13:03:03] <jcromartie> it doesn't work
[13:03:12] <jcromartie> it seems to work for lots of people though
[13:03:21] <danheberden> i would imagine with 1.4 it would
[13:03:47] <danheberden> now that sizzle uses qSA i'm sure a good chunk of that isn't working any longer, and 1.8 will be further down that path
[13:04:02] <jcromartie> hm, getElementsByTagNameNS
[13:04:09] <jcromartie> I see
[13:05:47] <gdoron> Hi shesek!
[13:05:55] <gdoron> Are you here?
[13:08:30] <gdoron> Is one of the jQuery developers here?
[13:09:27] <shoky> gdoron: some
[13:09:38] <gdoron> howdy
[13:09:47] <shoky> halu
[13:09:54] <gdoron> What do you got for us?
[13:10:04] <gdoron> jQuery master
[13:10:12] <gdoron> Sorry for the delay...
[13:10:20] <shoky> hmm
[13:10:35] <gdoron> That's not much ;)
[13:11:05] <shoky> im not a jq dev nor master ;p
[13:11:30] <shoky> im just  not too bad at figuring out other people's problems ;[
[13:12:17] <gdoron> Anyway, do you have any idea why parents and closest act differently?
[13:14:42] <jcromartie> nailed it: https://gist.github.com/2845902 if anybody else wants to use find() with an XML namespace
[13:15:44] <shoky> gdoron: well they're not meant to act exactly the same
[13:16:12] <Zzaichik> .parents() looks to the parent element, .closest() looks to sibling and/or parent or whatever is closest to said element and the goes up through DOM from there…… they start at diff levels of the dom
[13:17:01] <thinkt4nk> Zzaichik actually closest only traverses up the DOM tree
[13:17:09] <thinkt4nk> so it won't select siblings
[13:17:47] <Zzaichik> really
[13:18:33] <gdoron> You understood what I meant...
[13:18:43] <Zzaichik> interesting
[13:18:49] <goal|> hi!
[13:19:02] <thinkt4nk> yeah, the name can be confusing
[13:19:13] <gdoron> I'm asking about the implemention of those functions.
[13:19:31] <gdoron> closest is (Amazing) slower than parents
[13:19:36] <gdoron> Weird, we know!
[13:19:44] <shoky> "act differently" is not asking about implementation ;P
[13:20:00] <goal|> hey, i have a problem with .html() and .replaceWith() stripping out any and all <script> tags I have in the data that I want to put in.
[13:20:13] <goal|> why does that happen? how do i fix or get around that?
[13:20:47] <gdoron> goal, you need to give more details...
[13:22:24] <gdoron> What do you think shesek?
[13:22:29] <goal|> let me set it up, one moment
[13:22:38] <Zzaichik> so in that case, wouldn't .closest() look through not just the parent element but siblings of the selectors parent element?
[13:23:40] <goal|> http://pastebin.com/SwCaKWae
[13:24:03] <goal|> there, so in the callback's 'data' parameter I get an HTML snippit
[13:24:17] <goal|> in it there's a couple of <script> tags
[13:24:24] <goal|> they show up in the console
[13:24:33] <goal|> but when i look at the resulting page the tags are missing
[13:24:48] <goal|> like the .html() call stripped it out before adding it to the page
[13:26:07] <goal|> gdoron, are there any other details you think might be relevant?
[13:26:27] <sayd> im using jasmine and trying to figure out how to test that an async loaded $(el).load(url) is loaded. any tips?
[13:26:50] <goal|> .load has a callback parameter
[13:26:53] <thinkt4nk> sayd what's the possible point of failure?
[13:27:12] * hlveistired slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[13:27:22] <danheberden> side note, i would recommend not using .load() as it's getting deprecated in 1.8
[13:27:36] <hlveistired> Why?:
[13:27:37] <Zzaichik> gdoron: it breaks down the diff a little in the api. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:27:51] <gdoron> What do you mean?
[13:28:13] <gdoron> Zzaichik, what are you talking about?
[13:29:57] <Zzaichik> I was still looking at your question. Nevermind I guess
[13:31:18] <gdoron> Did you understand what am I asking about?
[13:32:23] <Zzaichik> Yeah. It was more for myself at this point. I thought that might help answer your question though.
[13:32:47] <gdoron> Are you a jQuery pro?
[13:33:46] <goal|> gdoron, any chance you can help me with my issue? (<script> getting stripped out of HTML I'm trying to insert)
[13:34:07] <gdoron> goal, can you set up a fiddle at jsfiddle.net?
[13:34:57] <goal|> i'm not familiar with it, but i don't think it's that necessary. i'm looking at a really small amount of code here.
[13:35:12] <gdoron> What is the thing again?
[13:35:28] <goal|> http://pastebin.com/SwCaKWae
[13:35:42] <goal|> if you look at the .get() call's defined callback
[13:35:59] <goal|> you see that i'm outputting the data to the console and then adding it to the document
[13:36:32] <goal|> that data contains a couple of <script> tags in it, but they and their contents are missing from where the rest of the data shows up on the page
[13:36:58] <goal|> specifically, it seems that <script> tags get stripped out
[13:37:09] <gdoron> For some reason I have problems with jsbin, can you please paste in at jsfiddle.net?
[13:37:10] <truk77> with the .each() method, is it guaranteed to iterate the elements in DOM order?
[13:37:18] <gdoron> Yes, in order.
[13:37:27] <truk77> Sweet, thanks gdoron
[13:37:45] <DaveJ|UK> Anyone recommend a tooltip plugin?
[13:38:00] <DaveJ|UK> I had a play with BeautyTips a few weeks ago but the site is down now and I can't find a reference
[13:38:50] <goal|> so what i'm seeing is the correct HTML output in my log, but the wrong one on my page.
[13:38:58] <sayd> danheberden: ahh really?
[13:39:06] <goal|> did you follow so far, gdoron?
[13:39:25] <sayd> i was trying to encapsulate the .load inside a class, and return some deferred or promise thing i could check in a runs/waitsFor jasmine spec
[13:39:46] <danheberden> jasmine has async stuff ya?
[13:40:39] <sayd> danheberden: yea, its the runs/waitsFor combo which i'm still trying to understand
[13:41:56] <sayd> but if i wanted to expose a promisy thing from my object, whats the way to do that? internally to the class, deferred is just a $.Deferred that gets resolved/rejected in the .load callback
[13:42:47] <Hornet> hm
[13:45:23] <danheberden> sayd in qunit, you'd do an async test and in the success function run start();
[13:45:26] <danheberden> so i'm not sure with jasmine
[13:46:19] <danheberden> $.ajax({url: 'somewhere'}).done( function(a){ /* test a is what you wanted */ ok('should actually work'); start(); });
[13:47:29] <sayd> ok i'll see if i can work from that. why is load getting sunsetted?>
[13:47:47] <sayd> and will there be an alternative/new way to accomplish it
[13:47:57] <goal|> i don't know if that's the right way to do that, actually
[13:48:37] <goal|> $.ajax({url: 'somewhere', success: function() { /* on success code here */ }});
[13:48:56] <danheberden> goal| you can inline the success in the options, or just use the promise returned
[13:49:00] <danheberden> i like promises, surprisingly
[13:49:09] <goal|> hmm
[13:49:14] <danheberden> sayd it's a bad method signature - .load is also an event handler
[13:49:51] <danheberden> goal| http://vimeo.com/22687950
[13:50:07] <danheberden> sayd - and really, running your ajax call and then doing what oyu want is just about as easy
[13:50:20] <z0ned> ive attached a "keyup" event to a text box. if the user deletes some text from it, is there any way to know what they deleted (aside from storing a global variable of its current updated contents at all times and doing string comparisons on .val) ?
[13:50:24] <danheberden> and gives you better oppurtunity to deal with failure
[13:50:36] <sayd> promises seem cool, im just not sure what to return in my function for the outside to see. somethign liek a .loaded property? method? was what i was thinking
[13:50:37] <goal|> hey, danheberden, would you know why when I try to put a string with HTML into a specific node it strips out all <script> tags?
[13:50:44] <danheberden> z0ned global wouldn't be required at all, but yeah, store it
[13:51:03] <elpaso> hi guys, how can I add a custom data attribute to an element? I want to use add data-filter attr to an element
[13:51:13] <danheberden> goal| it's a browser feature
[13:51:21] <danheberden> need to make it <\/script>
[13:51:32] <someprimetime> elpaso: <a data-filter="whatever">asdf</a>
[13:51:47] <someprimetime> <a id="foo" data-filter="whatever">asdf</a>
[13:51:54] <goal|> <\/script type="text/javascript> blah blah </script> like that?
[13:51:54] <someprimetime> then $('#foo').data('filter');
[13:51:59] <elpaso> I tried $('element').data('filter' , 'value'); but it didn't work
[13:52:22] <someprimetime> did you add data-filter into your html?
[13:52:25] <danheberden> goal| check out how i write the script tag here: http://weblog.bocoup.com/easily-test-jquery-pre-release-versions/
[13:52:28] <someprimetime> as an attribute?
[13:52:29] <elpaso> someprimetime: nope
[13:52:34] <someprimetime> well you have to do that
[13:52:37] <goal|> checking...
[13:52:49] <someprimetime> you can't just arbitrarily set a data attribute with that if it doesn't exist
[13:52:53] <shoky> sayd: why not return the promise itself?
[13:52:56] <elpaso> Can I add it using .attr() ?
[13:52:59] <someprimetime> if you want to do that you do .attr('data-filter', 'watever');
[13:53:02] <someprimetime> elpaso: yes
[13:53:05] <goal|> got it. trying.
[13:53:16] <elpaso> someprimetime: cool, let me try :)
[13:54:06] <sayd> shoky: i could, the test would just be strange. ie, var foo('url'); expect(foo.loaded.done).toHaveBeenCalled() or somethign
[13:54:08] <elpaso> awesome, it worked
[13:54:17] <elpaso> thanks for the help
[13:54:18] <sayd> err.. foo.loaded().done
[13:54:38] <shoky> sayd: sry donno what youre doin..
[13:54:59] <sayd> just ensuring the .done() gets called outside my class
[13:55:37] <goal|> danheberden, no luck. Here's the code that I have: http://pastebin.com/SwCaKWae
[13:55:39] <shoky> you want to affect the resolve state from outside?
[13:55:56] <goal|> what it does is request from the server a certain form which it recieves as an HTML string
[13:56:13] <sayd> shoky: i want to test that the resolve happens or will happen from the outside
[13:56:19] <goal|> that HTML string contains <script></script> tags in it. I tried changing the latter to <
[13:56:25] <goal|> <\/script>
[13:56:31] <goal|> but it just broke the page altogether
[13:56:35] <shoky> sayd: what's expect? foo.loaded.done? etc..
[13:56:58] <someprimetime> elpaso: no worries
[13:57:13] <sayd> expect is a jasmine way to call a matcher function. ie, expect(true).toBeTruthy()
[13:57:40] <shoky> mm i dono jasmine
[13:58:05] <sayd> foo would be an object that internally kicked off the deferred object and returned it or returned the promise as a property
[13:58:18] <goal|> danheberden?
[13:58:58] <xboi209> How would I turn whatever text is inside a div tag into the value of a variable?
[13:59:33] <tw2113> var myvar = $('div').text();
[13:59:33] <tw2113> ?
[13:59:35] <goal|> $('#yourDivId').html('whatever')
[13:59:44] <tw2113> or that
[13:59:58] * tw2113 winged it
[14:00:01] <xboi209> ty
[14:00:16] <goal|> it depends on whether or not you want to copy the contents of a div into a variable or a variable to be the contents of a div.

[14:06:48] <goal|> cybuch, what do you mean by "value"?
[14:06:57] <goal|> you mean the contents of the div or do you mean literally the attribute 'value'?
[14:08:05] <tamm0> <push> i'm using the ajax-form plugin by malsup for uploads. is there a chance to get the upload-bitrate-speed displayed? anyone has experiences? </push>
[14:13:06] <cybuch_> no no, text was to set element
[14:13:15] <cybuch_> and I wanna get an element, how to do that?
[14:16:14] <tamm0> cybuch_: i dont understand what you mean. you have a <div>sometext</div>. and you need to get "sometext" ?
[14:16:30] <cybuch_> ye, that's exactly what I want.
[14:17:23] <fsd> $('div.XYZ').text()
[14:17:23] <cybuch_> to be more precisely I'd like to add that I want to set some attribute to sometext from <div id="sometext">
[14:17:24] <tamm0> kidding me? :D -> <div id="someID">sometext</div> || JS: || $("#someID").html()
[14:18:57] <cybuch_> thanks
[14:19:02] <cybuch_> gonna play with that
[14:19:03] <cybuch_> ;)
[14:19:36] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm new to mobile app development, and I see jqMobile is pretty slick, but is this a solution for an independant app (native emulation)? or a solution for a mobile version of a site?
[14:19:37] <tamm0> ||sourceHTML:|| <div id="someID">sometext</div> || JS: || $("#someID").attr("title", $("#someID").text()) ||will be -=>|| <div id="someID" title="sometext">sometext</div>
[14:19:51] <fsd> ^^
[14:20:59] <tamm0> jrockjiggz: depends on how you use it
[14:21:19] <shoky> sayd: something like this maybe ? http://pastebin.com/u2z6TV1w
[14:23:50] <tamm0> jrockjiggz: its like "i heard about this 'water'. Can i use it for drinking hot or cold?"
[14:24:15] <rethus> can someone help bme to find the error.. i didn't find it... if i start jsfiddle above, i got strange error-messages: http://jsfiddle.net/vkE3K/8/
[14:25:02] <rethus> and firebug always tell: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token function
[14:25:06] <rethus> on line 293
[14:25:57] <rethus> found it.. its realy to late here for me :D
[14:26:06] <fsd> lol
[14:26:14] <shoky> sayd:  http://fiddle.jshell.net/Euw6D/
[14:26:34] <nFFF> haha debug and line 293 :D
[14:26:37] <shoky> (just changed Foo to $.get)
[14:26:41] <sayd> shoky: nice!
[14:26:43] <harry2> Hi
[14:26:51] <harry2> is there any way to see the jquery implementation for ajax?
[14:27:19] <shoky> harry2: sure
[14:27:46] <shoky> harry2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js
[14:27:51] <tamm0> rethus: forgot the ")" of prev function?
[14:27:56] <harry2> oh great thanks a lot!
[14:27:56] <shoky> well that's the master branch
[14:28:11] <rethus> tamm0; thanks, i found it
[14:28:17] <tamm0> ah, didnt saw it
[14:28:25] <sayd> shoky: so $.get is basically a promise? I see there is foo.done which seemingly comes for free
[14:28:32] <tamm0> <push> i'm using the ajax-form plugin by malsup for uploads. is there a chance to get the upload-bitrate-speed displayed? anyone has experiences? </push>
[14:28:33] <tamm0> :)
[14:29:17] <sayd> will dig into that after im done writing our teams testing guide
[14:29:54] <shoky> sayd: $.get  is a jqXHR which implements the promise interface
[14:30:46] <shoky> so to speak
[14:30:48] <sayd> ok. should probably use that since .load is going away
[14:31:09] <shoky> well $.ajax for full control
[14:31:10] <jsnoob> any reason why i can't find <div class="calendarDay" data-date="5/29/12"> with $("div.calendarDay[data-date='05/29/12']")
[14:31:42] <jsnoob> always returns an empty set
[14:31:57] <tw2113> why not just $('.calendarDay').data('date') ?
[14:32:12] <shoky> jsnoob: you have a leading 0 in one and not the other
[14:32:33] <jsnoob> shoky: damn, i'm sleepy as hell
[14:32:36] <jsnoob> thank you so much
[14:32:38] <tamm0> lol
[14:32:39] <shoky> ;p
[14:32:51] <tamm0> shoky: help me too! :D
[14:32:55] <shoky> ok!
[14:32:58] <shoky> oh. ajax-form
[14:33:01] <tamm0> yep
[14:33:14] <shoky> i dont have any experience with it
[14:33:20] <tamm0> or do you know where malsup is around? just found his twitter account
[14:33:20] <shoky> i can try..
[14:33:27] <shoky> no idea
[14:33:35] <hlveistired> GOOD NIGHT PEOPLE
[14:33:37] <harry2> so for ajax, where does it do like 'xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()' and 'xhr.open("POST", url")' and 'xhr.send()'
[14:33:52] <antnash> who's trying to do ajax form stuff?
[14:33:59] <tamm0> me, me
[14:34:06] <antnash> What you trying to do?
[14:34:25] <antnash> I'm on the same mission
[14:34:29] <tamm0> antnash: progress-bar is no problem. but how can i calculate the bitrate speed
[14:34:45] <antnash> Woah, hold on, how are you getting the progress bar working?
[14:34:58] <antnash> Give me that step and I'll help you figure out the other
[14:34:59] <shoky> harry2:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/ajax
[14:35:25] <tamm0> i use it for really big files (~4GB, yes, i know, ftp, blahblah, i decided to use it!). would be nice to get the uploadspeed as well
[14:38:56] <harry2> hmm ok maybe I should back up a bit
[14:39:07] <harry2> i've used jquery a lot but have only recently started learning javasript
[14:39:18] <harry2> what would be a good place in the code to start to look at
[14:39:30] <harry2> to start to see how jquery works?
[14:39:36] <harry2> at like a basic level
[14:39:56] <thomasmyrman> jQuery is mostly magic
[14:40:32] <cybuch_> tamm0: this is great, but could you glance at http://ajks.pl/Miernik/index.html ? It's just fine, with the value that it start, but when I change the value displayed on div #slider, the volume doesn't change
[14:40:41] <harry2> i can't tell if you're kidding or serious
[14:41:13] <tw2113> harry2 http://www.diveintojavascript.com/
[14:42:04] <shoky> harry2: also dont start with the ajax implementation, start with simpler & shorter stuff
[14:42:14] <tw2113> http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1338500508&sr=8-2
[14:42:15] <myrman> jquery: kidding of course. not sure what you're after since I just came here. jquery is javascript, only it takes care of a lot of things for you.
[14:42:39] <harry2> well so for example
[14:42:45] <harry2> where in the code does
[14:43:00] <harry2> $('#name') translate into document.getElementById('name')
[14:43:08] <myrman> yes
[14:43:27] <shoky> harry2: thats the $.fn.init
[14:43:29] <shoky> er
[14:43:50] <shoky> $.fn.init function
[14:44:00] <harry2> do you know what file that's in?
[14:44:15] <shoky> i usually just look in the full source
[14:44:20] <tw2113> isn't there only 1 file for jquery?
[14:44:37] <shoky> tw2113: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[14:44:46] <tw2113> guess not
[14:44:58] <shoky> that's when they're not bundled into a single one
[14:45:12] <myrman> harry2: something to consider is how jquery takes care of things when selecting. for example, getElementBy... OR getElementsBy... is handled by jquery. it hides which elements are unique in a way
[14:45:20] <myrman> But you probably know this already
[14:45:47] <shoky> sec harry2 i'll give you a nice vid to get you started
[14:46:03] <harry2> ok cool
[14:46:07] <shoky> harry2: http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[14:46:30] <shoky> but as you're seeing for yourself, you should also get a better handle on javascript proper
[14:47:25] <harry2> ok this video looks like what i was looking for
[14:47:29] <harry2> thanks a lot
[14:47:46] <harry2> who are the people behind jquery?
[14:47:47] <tamm0> cybuch_: which is your problem file and which line do you mean?
[14:47:48] <shoky> ;] he's awesome
[14:47:50] <harry2> out of curiosity
[14:48:07] <shoky> harry2: the original creator is john resig
[14:49:25] <cybuch_> 21st line,
[14:49:59] <cybuch_> it gets the value from 40th line, but it doesn't update
[14:51:09] <chrislabeard> how can I check if a div is visible in the browser window on scroll?
[14:51:38] <tamm0> cybuch_: if its a jquery slider you should try to get the value with $("#slider").slider("value")
[14:51:56] <cybuch_> tamm0: thank you :)
[14:54:06] <tamm0> cybuch_: but you need an eventListener at the slider for change to update the volume i think
[14:54:37] <cybuch_> tamm0: could you give a short example of one?
[14:55:41] <tamm0> moment
[14:55:50] <cybuch_> ok ;)
[14:59:23] <shoky> cybuch_: http://jsfiddle.net/nhBxq/1/
[14:59:35] <cybuch_> shoky: thanks ;)
[15:00:04] <cybuch_> shoky: but that's not exactly what I wanted to get
[15:00:17] <shoky> ya i didn't look at your site
[15:01:18] <cybuch_> shoky: thanks for good will anyways :)
[15:01:25] <myrman> cybuch_: is it your music?
[15:01:26] <shoky> ah i remember when it was just a big red square for turning the knob :P
[15:01:41] <cybuch_> shoky: yee :D
[15:02:00] <cybuch_> myrman: nope, it's a friend of mine
[15:06:34] <cybuch_> myrman: He's called Krvavy, if you want something in english I'd recommend song named hint - war isn't fair
[15:07:05] <tamm0> cybuch_: ah, your #slider isnt a .slider(), its just the id
[15:07:17] <cybuch_> tamm0: yup
[15:08:08] <shoky> cybuch_: $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) { /*... change volume here ... */ }  });
[15:08:15] <shoky> is that what you mean?
[15:09:55] <cybuch_> shoky: Not rlly I guess. I want to to set .Jplayer volume to the text that is displayed in #slider
[15:10:27] <shoky> when do you want this to happen
[15:10:40] <tamm0> cybuch_: not really. you want to set the volume of Jplayer everytime the canvas gets updated
[15:11:42] <cybuch_> tamm0: well, yeah
[15:11:46] <shoky> cybuch_ oh wtf you changed the plugin code??
[15:11:58] <shoky> and put your own selectors in there?
[15:12:01] <shoky> blah.
[15:12:04] <cybuch_> ;(
[15:12:10] <shoky> dont do that dude :\
[15:12:20] <shoky> the plugin has event hooks for this type of stuff exactly
[15:12:24] <shoky> like i showed you..
[15:12:39] <shoky> https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob
[15:13:36] <harry2> wow thats a cool plugin
[15:15:13] <shoky> anyway cybuch_: remove the line $('#slider').html(v);  from inside the plugin code
[15:16:28] <shoky> and change your knob line to:   $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val) } })
[15:16:32] <shoky> first of all that.
[15:17:04] <shoky> mm
[15:18:12] <shoky> well i guess change it to:  $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val);  $('#elo').jPlayer('volume', val/100); } );
[15:18:17] <shoky> or something
[15:19:04] <cybuch_> so I shall remove that #slider from knob.js and just put  $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val);  $('#elo').jPlayer('volume', val/100); } ); into script?
[15:19:19] <shoky> yes instead of  $(".knob").knob();
[15:19:56] <shoky> meanwhile i'll put the song on again ;D
[15:20:16] <cybuch_> do you like it?
[15:20:21] <shoky> ya not bad
[15:20:26] <shoky> not that i know.. polish?
[15:20:28] <cybuch_> it's in polish
[15:20:29] <cybuch_> :D
[15:20:39] <shoky> ;D my dad wouuld understand it ;P
[15:20:42] <cybuch_> try A.J.K.S. - polish as well
[15:20:48] <shoky> heh k
[15:20:54] <cybuch_> and energy level low - it's in english as well
[15:21:05] <shoky> kz
[15:21:21] <goal|> anyone here got an idea why would $("#MyDiv").html(myString) strip any <script></script> tags from the result?
[15:21:29] <cybuch_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVxurzQybCA
[15:22:08] <tamm0> perhaps because it will get executed
[15:22:29] <mbazian> Hi. Can I ask questions here about JQuery Validator?
[15:22:58] <goal|> tamm0, how do i prevent that from happening? i need that script to exist on the page.
[15:23:22] <goal|> the string i'm getting is a requested page from the server
[15:23:29] <goal|> it comes with an attached script that i need there
[15:23:37] <cybuch_> btw $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val);  i shall use this instead of my old implementation of a knob function in the head section?
[15:24:29] <mbazian> Does anyone know of an issue with validator that would cause .25 to not validate as a valid number?
[15:24:37] <shoky> yes . (you didnt implement the knob function, you called it)
[15:25:46] <shoky> mbazian: what validation method(s) are you using
[15:26:44] <mbazian> good question. I did not write this code, someone else did. In fact, I cannot even see where the code is being called.
[15:27:12] <jenia> hello everyone. im trying to implement the tabs widget and i cant get it to work like they do in the demo
[15:27:19] <mbazian> here's the line of HTML code
[15:27:20] <mbazian> <input class="pricedata number" type="text" size="4" id="item_0_356212[price]" name="items[0_356212][price]" value="" />
[15:27:31] <jenia> i copied and pasted their code, and still the tabs are not shown one by one
[15:27:43] <jenia> do know, as a widget - dynamically
[15:27:48] <jenia> what am i doing wrong?
[15:27:55] <mbazian> When the user enters a number here, it is validating the number .25 improperly.
[15:28:10] <gvo> jenia: did you load the css files?
[15:28:31] <jenia> nope
[15:28:37] <jenia> where do i get them?
[15:28:42] <mbazian> I can read HTML but I do not see where any code is being attached to the code
[15:28:51] <jenia> oh, you mean the application htere?
[15:28:53] <gvo> jenia look at the demo code to see if and what css
[15:29:07] <jenia> theres no css there
[15:29:08] <gvo> jenia look at the demo code to see if and what css is loaded
[15:29:14] <gvo> OK just a thought
[15:29:21] <shoky> mbazian: the "number" class is read by the validator (assuming you called .validate(...) )
[15:29:43] <norkakn> I have a jquery-ui widget that created elements.  I am attaching click handlers to the elements.  How do I access the methods of the widget from the click handler?
[15:30:38] <gvo> jenia are the pricedata and number classes defined inline?
[15:30:52] <jenia> no
[15:31:08] <gvo> jenia where are they defined?
[15:31:36] <jenia> i dont see anything like that defined
[15:31:42] <mbazian> shoky, first of all, thanks for the help. While I have written a lot of HTML and javascript, this stuff is over my head and I am trying to figure this out. Where can I look to check if .validator is being called? I have looked everywhere I can think of...
[15:31:51] <gvo> Jenia: where's the demo?  URL?
[15:32:12] <jenia> this is what i'm looking at:http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#default
[15:33:32] <gvo> jenia there are css files involved.
[15:33:47] <gvo> Go to that site and "view source"
[15:34:14] <gvo> You'll see three stylesheets included.
[15:34:21] <jenia> i'm clikcing view source
[15:34:33] <jenia> or you mean, to view the actual source using firebug?
[15:34:59] <gvo> Well, right click (on most browsers) and view source or whatever words your browser uses.
[15:35:44] <shoky> mbazian:  searched for 'validate' ?
[15:36:13] <jenia> thanks gvo
[15:36:39] <jenia> and those css scripts i can generate using the program provided by jquery - rolling interface' or something like that?
[15:36:44] <gvo> The "View source" on the page just gives you the  html/scripts.  It assumes you know how to implement jquery  already.
[15:36:49] <shoky> jenia:  http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started
[15:37:13] <gvo> yes
[15:37:23] <mbazian> shoky, where? It's not in the HTML.
[15:37:32] <mbazian> sorry for the dumb dumb questions...
[15:37:47] <gvo> jenia: see shoky's link
[15:38:10] <gvo> gotta run to a meeting.
[15:38:19] <jenia> okay thanks gvo
[15:39:44] <cybuch_> shoky: it still doesnt update
[15:46:46] <harry2> this is kind of random but
[15:46:58] <harry2> what's the best way to turn a javascript associate array into a query parameter string
[15:47:03] <harry2> like to turn
[15:47:39] <harry2> {name:'harry', age:'25'}
[15:47:41] <harry2> into
[15:47:49] <harry2> 'name=harry&age=25'
[15:47:59] <shoky> mbazian: i donno...
[15:48:40] <shoky> cybuch_: you didnt put the volume change like i said
[15:48:50] <shoky> cybuch_:  $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val);  $('#elo').jPlayer('volume', val/100); } );
[15:49:04] <cybuch_> oh
[15:49:10] <cybuch_> that what you meant there
[15:50:03] <cybuch_> didnt u forgot about '}' there?
[15:50:26] <mbazian> shoky, OK. I checked the entire project. I only see validator in default.js and framework php files. Nothing in the app specific php files. What's driving me nuts is that I do not see any event assignments on the <input> tag. Yet, the validation runs immediately upon leaving the field.
[15:50:32] <shoky> cybuch_:  yes
[15:50:48] <shoky> cybuch_: also you are now getting a javascript error
[15:50:56] <shoky> because you put:  .jPlayer("volume", val/100);
[15:51:03] <shoky> val is undefined there
[15:51:16] <shoky> just put your initial value there instead
[15:52:19] <cybuch_> could u close all of ) and } in the line u gave me?
[15:52:21] <shoky> mbazian did you search for 'validate' ?
[15:52:25] <shoky> lol.
[15:52:32] <mbazian> yes. I used wingrep.
[15:52:54] <shoky> cybuch_ $(".knob").knob({ 'change': function(val) {  $('#slider').html(val);  $('#elo').jPlayer('volume', val/100); } } );
[15:53:32] <shoky> mbazian: i dunno.. you say you see it in some other files?
[15:53:47] <cybuch_> omg
[15:53:49] <cybuch_> omg omg
[15:54:02] <shoky> omg omg you are using a plugin as its intended to be used ;P
[15:54:32] <mbazian> yes. I see in a whole bunch of files but I cannot see how the textbox calls it at all. Could the event be attached when the document is loaded?
[15:54:59] <cybuch_> shoky: http://foty.tk/images/brain.jpg
[15:55:00] <shoky> mbazian: it could...
[15:55:13] <shoky> cybuch_:  :)
[15:55:28] <cybuch_> shoky: http://foty.tk/images/brofistrjr.jpg
[15:55:31] <cybuch_> it works :D
[15:55:36] <shoky> i can hear :)
[15:56:03] <cybuch_> :)
[15:56:15] <mbazian> there would have to be something in the .js files that runs on load. I see nothing on the <FORM> tag like an Onload() or anyting like that
[15:56:28] <shoky> *brofist*
[15:57:06] <shoky> mbazian no idea
[15:57:27] <mbazian> OK. I will check this out a bit more and see what I can see. Thanks for the attempts
[15:57:36] <mbazian> I need to get more info to ask the question
[15:57:40] <shoky> maybe your php framework injects some validation stuff?
[15:57:47] <mbazian> I just wish there was a way to trace through the code
[15:57:52] <mbazian> Probably
[15:57:55] <mbazian> he is using zend
[15:57:58] <mbazian> or so it would seem
[15:58:01] <mbazian> I am just not sure
[15:58:06] <mbazian> c
[15:58:23] <shoky> well
[15:58:35] <shoky> you can see in chrome's devtools timeline  whats going on
[15:58:50] <shoky> you can search there and see if you find where it happens i guess.. not that its too fun to do
[15:59:55] <thorie> is there an event i can bind some code to, for when someone returns to my page via back-button?
[16:00:17] <mbazian> I use firefox and am trying to figure out Firebug
[16:01:30] <shoky> then try chrome devtools
[16:02:48] <mbazian> You've sold me. I will try it out
[16:02:49] <mbazian> thanks]
[16:04:35] <rhizmoe> is .on() a drop-in replacement for .bind()?
[16:06:47] <shoky> no
[16:06:56] <shoky> well
[16:07:27] <cybuch_> I'm going to sleep
[16:07:29] <shoky> it can be
[16:07:34] <cybuch_> shoky u liked energy level low?
[16:07:41] <shoky> didnt listen yet sori

[16:27:41] <rhizmoe> is this the standard syntax, using $(document)? $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){...}
[16:27:51] <rhizmoe> for all .on bindings?
[16:30:17] <ThrushAAX> rhizmoe: it depends how many a.offsite you have... I usually prefer $("a.offsite").on("click", function...)
[16:32:44] <rhizmoe> ThrushAAX: that's what i was trying, but it didn't seem to work.
[16:32:48] * rhizmoe goes back to drawing board
[16:47:55] <rhizmoe> should i be using something like gsub instead of .replace()?
[16:48:06] <rhizmoe> if i need to use /.../g that is
[16:48:31] <rhizmoe> man the jquery site is maddening
[16:48:40] <goal|> ?
[16:49:50] <rhizmoe> i need to do a global regex replacement on a string, and .replace() seems to a) not be jQuery; b) only replace the first instance
[16:50:20] <rhizmoe> jquery's site search returns 0 results for 'regex', which seems wrong.
[16:50:59] <rhizmoe> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-replace-string-characters-using-jquery
[16:51:03] <rhizmoe> fantastic page
[16:52:01] <scathen^C> hey guys i have a few pairs of objects that need to have the exact same funtionality between them (say when #object1 is clicked #box1 is effected, when #object2 is clicked #box2 is effected in the same way). Is there some example somewhere of how this can be done?
[16:52:38] <rhizmoe> is a space a curious character in replace()? as in .replace(/ /g,"foo")
[16:53:10] * rhizmoe tries /\ /
[16:55:31] <rhizmoe> indeed that did the trick.
[16:55:38] * rhizmoe drools
[16:55:40] <lurraca> hi, anyone familiar with getJSON method?
[16:55:57] <rhizmoe> just ask your question. if someone knows, they'll answer
[16:57:00] <lurraca> I want to access to the elements of my json response
[16:57:06] <lurraca> im trying this
[16:57:08] <lurraca> $.getJSON('http://23.21.128.153:3000/api/v1/holidays', function(data){
[16:57:08] <lurraca> 			alert("this: " + data.holiday[0].name));
[16:57:08] <lurraca> 	 });
[16:57:34] <lurraca> but doesnt seems to work
[16:58:38] <xinc> rhizmoe: you shouldn't need to escape spaces in a javascript regex.
[16:58:42] <rhizmoe> lurraca: console.log data
[16:58:44] <rhizmoe> xinc: yet i do
[17:00:21] <rhizmoe> xinc: could be coffeescript meddling, now that i consider
[17:00:53] <someprimetime> is it possible to scroll on the document with animate instead of the native browser scroll?
[17:00:57] <someprimetime> i just want a smoother experience
[17:01:21] <xinc> rhizmoe: yeah, just tested in plain javascript and it's not needed, so something else must be affecting your regex.
[17:01:53] <rhizmoe> might be a coffeescript bug report in there somewhere
[17:01:53] <someprimetime> something like http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9pnd8/
[17:01:55] <rhizmoe> ;)
[17:01:57] <rhizmoe> thanks
[17:02:14] <xinc> np
[17:06:05] <lurraca> rhizmoe: what im supposed to see with console.log(data)
[17:07:13] <sayd> lurraca: you should change your tab char in vim
[17:07:49] <sayd> and use set list
[18:17:20] <Ghost1227> i'm trying to convert a simple php pagination snippet to jquery, but i'm feeling REALLY out of my depth... anyone got a few minutes to help me out?
[18:21:03] <tamm0> Ghost1227: y u no just pastebin the code and ask then?
[18:21:15] <Ghost1227> i'm working on the pastebin
[18:21:45] <tamm0> its not a desktop. its a page where you can paste your code
[18:22:01] <tamm0> oh, sorry, thought i saw a "not"
[18:22:02] <tamm0> :)
[18:22:35] <chomp> jquery ui, is there a more convenient way to bring a stacking draggable to the front, besides just manually handling a click event and setting the z-index?
[18:22:41] <chomp> like simulating a drag start+stop?
[18:23:06] <chomp> i should clarify, i specifically want to bring one to the front when clicked :p
[18:25:11] <Ghost1227> lol
[18:25:14] <Ghost1227> tamm0: http://pastebin.com/adna6fjf
[18:25:36] <Ghost1227> that's what i have now... and it works, but reloading the page constantly doesn't look professional
[18:30:01] <shoky> chomp: don't think there's anything more convenient
[18:30:28] <shoky> chomp: wait its in response to a click event?
[18:30:28] <chomp> shoky, yeah i eventually found that while there used to be a method to bring them to the front, it was removed in a rewrite
[18:30:49] <chomp> i solved it by simply finding the max z-index and setting the clicked element's z-index to that plus 1.
[18:30:57] <chomp> shoky, yes
[18:31:26] <shoky> if its a click event it should work if you set the stack option no?
[18:31:37] <chomp> nope, it only happens on an actual drag event
[18:31:43] <shoky> ah
[18:32:11] <shoky> so yea click handle that mofo i guess
[18:33:03] <chomp> aye, solved with http://pastebin.com/2d7yyY1h
[18:34:39] <shoky> hmm could prolly be done a bit nicer with map
[18:35:57] <chomp> good point
[18:36:13] <chomp> don't suppose there's an equivalent fold method too? :p
[18:36:43] <shoky> nope not in jquery
[18:36:44] <chomp> or reduce, or whatever you want to call it
[18:36:49] <chomp> sadness
[18:37:00] <shoky> pretty simple to make your own ;p
[18:37:23] <shoky> or use underscore.js
[18:37:34] <xboi209> how do i get a number from the address bar using jquery?
[18:37:41] <systemfault> underscore++
[18:38:05] <chomp> ooh, underscore looks sexy.
[18:38:16] <chomp> i'm relatively new to the js landscape, if that isn't obvious.
[18:38:20] <systemfault> it is sexy
[18:39:29] <xboi209> guess im ignored...
[18:40:12] <systemfault> xboi209: Ask a real question…
[18:41:55] <Ghost1227> tamm0: thoughts?
[18:42:55] <shoky> chomp:  var maxZ = Math.max.apply( Math, $('div').map( function() { return parseFloat( $(this).css('z-index') ) || 0 } ) )
[18:42:55] <shoky> :P
[18:43:28] <systemfault> oh yeah
[18:43:39] <shoky> well, .frame instead of div
[18:44:46] <chomp> oh my, apply.  this is getting good :)
[18:45:11] <shoky> heh it's marginally shorter than yours, and yours is more readable probably ;)
[18:45:35] <chomp> everything you say is true, but i have a soft spot for functional code
[18:45:44] <shoky> yep ;D
[18:45:56] <systemfault> I prefer dysfunctional! lulz
[18:46:06] <shoky> lawl
[18:48:44] <scathen^C> hey guys is there a way to simulate a click on an object?
[18:49:07] <systemfault> scathen^C: Select the node and .click() it
[18:49:19] <systemfault> (Without passing a parameter)
[18:49:32] <scathen^C> cheers
[18:49:45] <systemfault> .trigger('click') also works
[18:51:58] <balazs> hi
[18:52:01] <Ghost1227> i'm trying to convert a simple php pagination snippet (http://pastebin.com/adna6fjf) to jquery, but i'm feeling REALLY out of my depth... anyone got a few minutes to help me out?
[18:54:27] <balazs> I have two classes "favorite" and "unfavorite" each with a custom click handler. One of the functions is to switch the class of the link to the opposite one, since I'm updating the user's favoriteness with AJAX.
[18:55:14] <balazs> however this doesn't seem to work: $(this).removeClass('favorite_link').addClass('unfavorite_link'); It does update the class when I look at it in Chrome, but it calls the wrong handler with the next click
[18:55:32] <balazs> am I misunderstanding something ?
[19:01:11] <Whirl3d> balazs, you will want to use the .on handler for that
[19:01:11] <bot-t> (34 hours 10 mins ago) <shoky> tell Whirl3d just smth i fiddled maybe you'd find helpful - http://jsfiddle.net/D9v5A/
[19:02:15] <balazs> Whirl3d:  $(".favorite_link").onclick(function(){ ....
[19:02:24] <balazs> instead of  $(".favorite_link").click(function(){
[19:02:55] <Whirl3d> balazs, actually, in the parent container to your elements, you want to apply the .on handler with a selector like this:
[19:03:19] <Whirl3d> $(".container").on("click",".favorite", function (e) {do stuff...
[19:03:38] <Whirl3d> then, whenever you add an element of the favorite class, it's clickable
[19:04:22] <Whirl3d> otherwise, $(".favorite").click()   or $(".favorite").on("click") only applies the click handler to the elements marked ".favoriate" at the time you did the assignment
[19:04:29] <balazs> let me digest it ...
[19:04:55] <xboi209> how would i separate text or numbers if i use document.write(location.search)
[19:05:13] <Whirl3d> do not use document.write
[19:05:21] <Whirl3d> do not use location.search
[19:05:43] <xboi209> ._.
[19:05:58] <Whirl3d> do you $("body").append("<p>"+location.href+"</p>");
[19:06:08] <Whirl3d> *use not you, lol
[19:07:47] <Whirl3d> i thought / tell was a command in IRC. How do I leave a message for someone when they sign in, like shoky left for me?
[19:08:45] <Whirl3d> balazs, do you see the difference between the two ways of approaching your click handler?
[19:09:22] <balazs> I think it's sinking in
[19:09:30] <balazs> but what am I doing wrong ? http://pastebin.com/yXTvUbsj
[19:10:18] <Whirl3d> well, to start, you are using pastebin. LOL I so definitely prefer jsfiddle. But I will check it out now.
[19:10:31] <balazs> LOL. thanks
[19:11:02] <balazs> oh #current_interests is the parent's parent
[19:11:16] <shoky> ?tell Whirl3d like this ;p
[19:11:16] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[19:11:29] <shoky> but bot-t is hardly here lately
[19:11:35] <Whirl3d> dangit, it's ?
[19:11:35] <bot-t> (20 secs ago) <shoky> tell Whirl3d like this ;p
[19:11:41] <shoky> mmm
[19:11:45] <shoky> tell Whirl3d like this ;p
[19:11:50] <shoky> bot-t, tell Whirl3d like this ;p
[19:11:51] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[19:12:00] <shoky> ;P
[19:12:05] <Whirl3d> shoky, you are a genius. Mine looks a lot like that, only bloated and sweaty.
[19:12:05] <bot-t> (14 secs ago) <shoky> tell Whirl3d like this ;p
[19:12:11] <shoky> lol@sweaty
[19:12:34] <Whirl3d> I got all bogged down in state-wise prefixes
[19:12:57] <Whirl3d> like init-propertyname or start-propoerty-name or end-property-name...
[19:12:59] <shoky> i also edited it into this: http://jsfiddle.net/HEd6p/
[19:13:05] <shoky> not sure which is nicer
[19:13:28] <Whirl3d> Very nice.
[19:13:38] <Whirl3d> I combine delay as a prop and pull it out in advance.
[19:13:41] <shoky> because here there is that neccessary ()  on the first .anim call
[19:13:48] <systemfault> I caress myself at night while thinking of the jquery promise implementation.
[19:13:50] <Whirl3d> and the fuse class uses an array (which uses .pipe internally)
[19:13:56] <systemfault> (Damn it's good)
[19:14:01] <shoky> ;>
[19:14:38] <balazs> I think I'm not passing the parameters right. "this" will be different
[19:15:13] <Whirl3d> balazs, I noticed some weird classnaming conventions. Double check that you want unfavorite and not-favorite and ...etc.
[19:15:57] <Whirl3d> also, you want to handle the unfavorite links to makefavorite
[19:16:08] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/L5mqe/
[19:16:13] <Whirl3d> and favorite links to unfavorite link.
[19:16:19] <Whirl3d> he lives!
[19:16:23] <Eviltwin> (Don't actually recommend that)
[19:16:34] <Eviltwin> But I managed to lose the ()
[19:16:49] <shoky> heh sweet :)
[19:17:45] <balazs> Whirl3d: yeah it's weird naming convention because the "favorite" link makes you from "unfavorite" to "favorite". but I think I have bigger problems:
[19:17:58] <balazs> $(".auser").on("click", ".unfavorite_link", function(e){alert(2)});
[19:18:19] <balazs> auser is a class for the parent, but I don't see the alert
[19:19:03] <Whirl3d> try this: $(".auser").on("click", function (e) {console.log(e);});
[19:20:15] <Whirl3d> and besides, shoky & Eviltwin, wouldn't it be best to do $(elem).anim(props, delay).anim(props, delay), anim(props, delay)
[19:20:32] <Whirl3d> which wouldn't work the way it is written
[19:20:52] <Whirl3d> and Ideally $(elem).anim([{props,delay
[19:20:58] <Eviltwin> But that would target the same element each time
[19:21:01] <Whirl3d> },{props, delay}]);
[19:21:22] <Whirl3d> Sorry, I pass a target property in my anim function
[19:21:39] <scathen^C> hey guys i am using a third party tool, which when i click on a toolbar displays. If i use .focus() manually, everything works except the toolbar doesn't display. ive also tried .click() as well as focus but no difference. Is there any way to simulate an actual click on the object?
[19:22:35] <Whirl3d> scathen^C, try .click()   with no params or .trigger("click");
[19:23:02] <scathen^C> ok
[19:24:08] <balazs> Whirl3d: totally works
[19:24:32] <balazs> I need to read up on the DOM
[19:24:49] <Whirl3d> When you have a function that takes multiple invocations based on the parameters passed, is there a convention for splitting up the different implementations?
[19:26:40] <scathen^C> hrm, ok how do you focus on first child?
[19:27:07] <systemfault> Whirl3d: A design issue?
[19:27:08] <systemfault> :/
[19:27:32] <Whirl3d> $("element").children().first().focus()   is one way...ugly but it should work.
[19:28:00] <scathen^C> would element:first-child also work?
[19:28:40] <Whirl3d> systemfault, like for example, in the current plugin pattern, you check if no params are passed and possibly return a value, if a "method" is passed as the first param, call the method with the remaining, if not init the plugin with the arguments
[19:29:02] <chomp> huh, anyone use codemirror?
[19:29:04] <Whirl3d> so three different invocations cause three different implementations
[19:29:41] <systemfault> Ahhh, yeah.. there's an example of that usage on the authoring section, not sure if that's what you want :/
[19:30:20] <put_nick_here> hey systemfault
[19:30:28] <put_nick_here> it's me grant. :P
[19:30:34] <systemfault> Ahhhh
[19:30:36] <systemfault> :P
[19:30:45] <put_nick_here> too lazy... gave up with irc nicknames
[19:30:52] <systemfault> :)
[19:30:59] <systemfault> put_nick_here: What's up?
[19:31:04] <put_nick_here> nothing
[19:31:07] <put_nick_here> boooored
[19:31:16] <put_nick_here> might as well idle
[19:31:20] <Whirl3d> that usage is easy, i was wanting to use my animation function with different props to be flexible and wanted to structure my code nicely...it's probably ill advised, but I'd like to try it anyways
[19:31:21] <systemfault> :)
[19:33:34] <tga> hey, in jqmobile how do you get the url of the page in a changepage handler?
[19:34:33] <shoky> Whirl3d you could always call different private implementation functions for different params, or at least for the part of the implementation that's different
[19:34:42] <ngharo> tga: window.location ?
[19:34:42] <shoky> ^^ for example
[19:35:07] <tga> oh, I think I was making it too complicated for myself
[19:35:16] <tga> it won't work for pagebeforechange, but in this case it might
[19:36:36] <Whirl3d> shoky, yeah, right now I am trying to do separate private filter functions that filter the arguments into a single consistent animation call of the core function
[19:37:43] <Whirl3d> but then I lose the advantage of cached values for each private function....so I have tried it where I create the private functions as closures
[19:39:51] <shoky> hmm closures sounds good ;P
[19:42:49] <Ghost1227> i'm trying to convert a simple php pagination snippet (http://pastebin.com/adna6fjf) to jquery, but i'm feeling REALLY out of my depth... anyone got a few minutes to help me out?
[19:50:28] <shoky> Ghost1227: which part are you having trouble with
[19:50:57] <shoky> (i dont rly know php btw)
[19:51:31] <xjiujiu> :D
[19:51:53] <shoky> but if you actually ask a question (preferably related to jquery, not php) then you'll get help
[19:52:33] <xjiujiu> I'm good at php :D
[19:52:43] <systemfault> PHP sux0r
[19:53:03] <shoky> systemfault: what do you use?
[19:53:07] <shoky> or what do you like to use
[19:53:12] <Ghost1227> shoky: i know next to nothing about jquery? lol... i've managed to figure out how to load paginated content if the content is already there (as in several divs or something), but in my case the pages are handled by the remote api... you just pass which page you want to pull data for and it does the rest. I can't figure out how to handle the api calls in relation to the pagination. ie, when i click the 'next' button, how do i get it to pul
[19:53:12] <Ghost1227> l the next page?
[19:53:14] <systemfault> shoky: Whatever I have to use :(
[19:53:23] <systemfault> shoky: PHP and Java currently.
[19:53:23] <shoky> hence the second question :)
[19:53:35] <shoky> kool
[19:53:54] <shoky> what java server?
[19:54:08] <systemfault> shoky: Tomcat, we use spring 3.1
[19:54:14] <shoky> cool
[19:54:25] <shoky> i never had the time to get into spring ;(
[19:54:41] <Ghost1227> anyone else is welcome to give their thoughts too... i've been going round in circles with this all day and i'm just getting aggrivated
[19:54:43] <xjiujiu> Ghost1227, the current page number sub one :D
[19:54:44] <gianbalex> spring? The linux game?
[19:54:54] <Ghost1227> ximarin: huh?
[19:54:55] <systemfault> shoky: It's a nice framework but now that JEE6 sucks less than before, I can see spring becoming less popular in the future.
[19:55:17] <systemfault> shoky: In the end.. only time will tell
[19:55:21] <shoky> aye JEE6 is starting to look usable :)
[19:55:34] <xjiujiu> jee6?
[19:55:41] <xjiujiu> What is this?
[19:55:44] <shoky> xjiujiu: java enterprise edition
[19:56:02] <systemfault> shoky: One day.. I'll have to learn ruby or python..
[19:56:16] <Ghost1227> ximarin: if i understand you, that's basically what i'm doing with the current system... but i can't figure out how to convert it
[19:56:21] <shoky> hrm
[19:56:39] <Ghost1227> i've tried reading through probably 20 jquery pagination scripts and it's got my head spinning
[19:57:58] <xjiujiu> shoky: jee6 equal j2ee sdk 6?
[19:58:15] <systemfault> xjiujiu: Yeah… Oracle wants to get rid of the 2
[19:58:23] <shoky> heh j2ee is like.. obsolete
[19:58:42] <xjiujiu> Oh ~
[19:59:33] <shoky> well i suppose jee6 ~= j6ee :P
[20:00:33] <systemfault> What do you guys think of AMD?
[20:00:47] <systemfault> (Not the CPU company.. it sucks KTHX)
[20:00:56] <ryez> why the `:last` selector doesn't provide an optional argument to select last n element?
[20:00:57] <shoky> haven't used it myself. but it seems legit ;P
[20:01:26] <ryez> what's the easiest workaround?
[20:01:37] <systemfault> ryez: using slice
[20:01:59] <shoky> or .eq( -3 ) ?
[20:02:08] <systemfault> Ah
[20:02:14] <systemfault> Didn't know about that one
[20:02:28] <systemfault> ?eval [1,2,3,4,5].slice(-3);
[20:02:29] <bot-t> systemfault: [3, 4, 5]
[20:02:31] <shoky> didnt try it but docs seem to point to it
[20:02:48] <shoky> oh he wanted the last 3 elements
[20:02:50] <shoky> Sry
[20:03:12] <shoky> or did he
[20:05:10] <ryez> systemfault, shoky: thank you! I was just reading the doc
[20:05:57] <ryez> and yes, I want something like last n elements, n could be 3
[20:08:43] <Ghost1227> ...
[20:10:15] <tw2113> yes Ghost1227 ?
[20:12:40] <Ghost1227> hey tw2113
[20:12:59] <Ghost1227> just trying to figure out an something that's been haunting me all day :P
[20:13:39] <tw2113> sadly it's never guaranteed that someone else has a solution
[20:13:56] <tw2113> sometimes you're left innovating a method alone
[20:16:37] <wodemaye__> can an iframed page set parent.location?
[20:19:44] <astropirate> wodemaye__, i believe if they are in the same domain they can
[20:19:48] <astropirate> i think*
[20:20:05] <systemfault> Even if it's not on the same domain...
[20:20:10] <Ghost1227> tw2113: soi've noticed. my solution sucks though
[20:20:21] <systemfault> Escaping an iframe is something standard.
[20:20:41] <systemfault> People do that on websites when they don't want to be iframed.
[20:21:54] <tw2113> so keep researching to improve
[20:56:36] <balazs> I'm doing something like: $("#foo").after('<div class="bar">text</div'); Thinhg are displayed correctly, but it doesn't seem like that div really has the class "bar"
[21:06:07] <shoky> balazs: that should work fine (if you close the </div> )
[21:07:10] <balazs> shoky: I did in my real code, but it doesn't work. displays nice, but the classes are not applied
[21:07:35] <shoky> what makes you say they're not applied?
[21:09:27] <shoky> balazs: http://jsfiddle.net/LPBT2/
[21:12:05] <balazs> right. I think it's the same problem as I had before. I'm setting some properties with $(document).ready for the class of the row added, and that doesn't get picked up
[21:12:24] <balazs> trying to get a minimal example
[21:21:31] <balazs> http://pastebin.com/AWA8Q3TN
[21:21:59] <balazs> hold on !
[21:22:41] <shoky> class=".remove_link"
[21:24:08] <balazs> yup, that's what I fixed, but there's a different issue
[21:24:10] <balazs> http://pastebin.com/HLZLdCtW
[21:25:17] <shoky> again you didnt close the </div
[21:25:29] <shoky> donno dude: http://jsfiddle.net/LPBT2/1/
[21:27:04] <shoky> so your real issue is that the click handler for the added div isn't called, right
[21:27:09] <shoky> you should've said so
[21:27:17] <balazs> shit, but that's still not the issue. clicking on the newly created div does not make it disappear
[21:27:23] <balazs> yes
[21:27:43] <balazs> that's what I meant by saying that the new div doesn't really honor the class it's in
[21:28:31] <Sudhansu> i have menu... when i click the menu item it loads  a web page.... however after loading the webpage i have an custom userdefined function to convert an input address to respective geocode stops working... if the page loads directly then it is working
[21:28:38] <shoky> balazs: it honors the class
[21:29:04] <Sudhansu> how to do that
[21:29:12] <runvnc> sudhansu can you jsfiddle it
[21:29:18] <shoky> balazs: read about .on() and event delegation. when you did  $(".remove_link").click(....)  the .remove_link was not in the DOM yet
[21:29:21] <Sudhansu> ok
[21:29:23] <shoky> so you didnt bind any event
[21:29:33] <runvnc> hardest part is trying to imagine exactly what you are describing
[21:29:39] <shoky> balazs: see  http://jsfiddle.net/LPBT2/2/
[21:30:18] <shoky> you either need to do it that way with .on, or you need to bind the .click AFTER adding the new div to the DOM
[21:31:44] <Sudhansu> runvnc done
[21:32:00] <balazs> hmm I see
[21:33:14] <Sudhansu> i am loding  this using load() method thn the user defined function codeAddress() not working
[21:37:41] <Sudhansu> how to load a userdefined function
[21:38:21] <shoky> Sudhansu: if you jsfiddled it then give a link..
[21:39:05] <Sudhansu> http://jsfiddle.net/LPBT2/2/
[21:39:43] <shoky> that's the link i gave ...
[21:39:57] <kratsg_> How do I change the default behavior of loading tabs from hash with jQuery UI Tabs
[21:39:59] <shoky> o_O
[21:41:42] <Sudhansu> ok
[21:41:45] <runvnc> ?
[21:41:52] <runvnc> ??
[21:42:05] <shoky> LoL.
[21:42:30] <Sudhansu> where to find the link
[21:42:33] <Sudhansu> of the code
[21:42:42] <shoky> :\
[21:42:43] <shoky> goodnight
[21:45:50] <balazs> goodnight
[21:47:00] <Sudhansu> runvnc
[21:47:02] <Sudhansu> http://jsfiddle.net/sudhannsu/KmQUM/
[21:47:09] <Sudhansu> see the code here
[21:47:58] <runvnc> ok whats the problem
[21:48:02] <runvnc> I put a couple cities in
[21:48:07] <runvnc> it said it works and gave a coordinate
[21:48:07] <Sudhansu> when i load this page using load() it is not working...
[21:48:09] <runvnc> or half
[21:48:35] <runvnc> whats the link to the actual page
[21:48:39] <runvnc> because the jsfiddle works
[21:48:44] <Sudhansu> hmm but when i load to another file of div it is not working
[21:48:57] <Sudhansu> www.dialandclick.com
[21:49:11] <Sudhansu> you click the search link above
[21:49:31] <Sudhansu> u see the page.. but event for the textbox is not working
[21:50:01] <runvnc> I dont see the fsfiddle code anywhere in there
[21:50:13] <runvnc> oh ok
[21:50:40] <Sudhansu> u understand my problem
[21:50:43] <runvnc> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'codeAddress'
[21:50:52] <runvnc> do you have firebug or chrome developer tools open
[21:51:13] <Sudhansu> firebug plugin id doesnot show error
[21:51:26] <Sudhansu> how u checked the error
[21:51:30] <runvnc> google chrome
[21:51:34] <runvnc> control-shift-j
[21:51:41] <Sudhansu> i have firebug
[21:51:42] <runvnc> click the little > in the bottom left
[21:52:28] <Sudhansu> i dont hv chrome developer tool
[21:52:43] <Sudhansu> is it possible to chk in firebug
[21:52:50] <kratsg_> Does anyone know the Tabs UI?
[21:55:13] <runvnc> sudhansu: do this
[21:55:20] <runvnc> take the code from the jsfiddle
[21:55:41] <runvnc> add a <script> section to dialandclick.com after the jquery
[21:55:55] <runvnc> put that jsfiddle code in the page
[21:56:44] <runvnc> or
[21:56:52] <runvnc> take the jsfiddle page and put it in an iframe
[21:56:58] <runvnc> if you do either of those things, it will work
[21:57:22] <runvnc> maybe one of these other geniuses on here wants to beat their head to get the google maps and everything to load dynamically
[21:57:25] <runvnc> but thats not for me
[21:57:33] <runvnc> because its a waste of time
[22:02:57] <kratsg_> Does anyone know how to fix scrolling issues with UI Tabs?
[22:04:22] <runvnc> exactly what kind of scrolling issue
[22:04:43] <runvnc> probably more like a #css problem
[22:05:20] <kratsg_> When you set the location.hash in the URL - stopping the page from scrolling to that ID.
[22:05:43] <kratsg_> It seems you need to rewrite the original library so you include some sort of modifier in front of the hash so that the browser can't find an element with that particular ID.
[22:10:36] <donkeycongo> Can somebody recommend me an ajax-file-upload extension for jQuery?
[22:18:35] <Back2Basics> Can you figure out how http://jsfiddle.net/y7gQc/ can validate and post json results?  (this problem has been stumping me and several people I know.)  it's all of 15 lines of jquery modifications.
[22:25:29] <nelsonkeating> anyone have an opinion on the best way to setup a form where the user will potentially enter a lot of records? I need to allow my users to add their friends names, birthdays and some other basic info?
[22:25:36] <nelsonkeating> i asked this question here.. if you look at the image you will immediately get what I'm talking about.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10760919/jquery-table-input-in-rails-app
[22:25:57] <runvnc> Back2Basics, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[22:26:34] <runvnc> Do you have Chrome? Get Chrome and hit control shift j
[22:26:37] <runvnc> or try it in firebug
[22:27:37] <sudhansu> <runvnc> hey it does not show any error
[22:27:55] <runvnc> I'm talking to back2basics
[22:28:01] <sudhansu> could u help me please runvnc
[22:28:02] <donkeycongo> Can somebody recommend me an ajax-file-upload extension for jQuery?
[22:28:13] <javalover> I am so smart
[22:28:19] <runvnc> donkey: AjaxUpload
[22:28:21] <javalover> I am so smart, smrt I MEAN S M A R T!
[22:28:37] <runvnc> sudhansu did you ever post a link to the jsfiddle
[22:28:46] <donkeycongo> runvnc: Ill take a look. Thanks
[22:28:47] <systemfault> donkeycongo: The problem is that there's no way to portably ajax load files.. there are only hacks.
[22:28:59] <sudhansu> i dont know
[22:29:04] <sudhansu> how to do that
[22:29:07] <systemfault> *upload files
[22:29:46] <Back2Basics> runvnc: it's complaining about the whole reason to do this using json.
[22:29:59] <runvnc> donkey forget that ajaxupload .. google doesn't go to the thing I remember
[22:30:03] <runvnc> goes to a different one
[22:30:08] <runvnc> don't remember what to google
[22:30:20] <systemfault> javalover: Usually.. when I hear/read that, the guy saying it, actually sucks ass but suffers from the dunning-kruger effect.
[22:30:20] <Back2Basics> runvnc: I want that sub-dictionary
[22:30:31] <sudhansu> ok
[22:30:51] <javalover> my man, I just invented a new way of looking at pictures on the internet
[22:30:53] <runvnc> back2basics you are saying you don't know how to correct the syntax error?
[22:31:01] <javalover> so I don't care what you say, this shit is sick!
[22:31:10] <systemfault> javalover: Congratulations.
[22:31:20] <runvnc> what is the link javalover
[22:31:28] <Back2Basics> runvnc: I don't want just name: value pairs
[22:31:35] <javalover> oh I can't reveal that at the present time it's NDA and not released yet
[22:31:43] <runvnc> lol
[22:31:47] <javalover> but i can tell you this, free your mind & look at things from a new perspective
[22:31:57] <Back2Basics> runvnc: I want name : {name:value} as well
[22:32:07] <javalover> and you might laugh but instagram was recently bought for 1 billion. So this has to be worth something!
[22:33:44] <sudhansu> i want to load a page using load() to another page div tag... but when loaded the page it is not working
[22:33:49] <sudhansu> how to do thar
[22:34:19] <systemfault> sudhansu: Does it gets help from the government?
[22:34:30] <systemfault> sudhansu: Losing its job can be bad.
[22:34:45] <sudhansu> ohh
[22:35:25] <systemfault> sudhansu: When you'll have enough of my stupid comments… then tell me/us what "doesn't work" means
[22:35:33] <sudhansu> could any one help please
[22:35:34] <runvnc> back2basics what if you just use data: postval
[22:36:10] <Back2Basics> runvnc: sorry what do you mean?
[22:36:16] <runvnc> sudhansu if you are on jsfiddle.net then copy the url
[22:36:36] <Back2Basics> runvnc: http://json.org/example.html take a look at this example
[22:36:43] <sudhansu> http://jsfiddle.net/sudhannsu/KmQUM/1/
[22:37:14] <Back2Basics> runvnc: see how there is structure?
[22:37:27] <systemfault> sudhansu: Where is the call to .load?
[22:37:27] <sudhansu> when i type someting in the textbox it show one dilog but when it loaded into another page it is not working
[22:37:33] <niftylettuce> it seems that when doing a lot of CSS transitions in iOS Mobile Safari for iPod Touch 4G the browser always crashes
[22:37:39] <niftylettuce> (e.g. using !Modernizr.csstransitions) as value of isAnimated property for jQuery plugins like isotope and masonry
[22:37:51] <sudhansu> i called it another page
[22:38:07] <niftylettuce> it takes forever to recalculate, I've tried hardware accelerating it by adding `-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);` but I don't think that worked
[22:38:15] <Back2Basics> runvnc: if you did name:value pairs then you might as well use the regular POST operation from a form.  (no ajax+json required)
[22:38:55] <runvnc> http://jsfiddle.net/3Ws4Q/4/
[22:39:01] <runvnc> back2basics see that
[22:39:06] <systemfault> Back2Basics: What do you want to do?
[22:39:19] <runvnc> just assign postval ahead of time
[22:39:53] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You want to send json to the server?
[22:40:09] <Back2Basics> systemfault: yes
[22:40:33] <runvnc> back2basics did you read my updated jsfiddle
[22:40:36] <Back2Basics> runvnc: but you got rid of the structure.
[22:40:39] <runvnc> that doesnt have a syntax error
[22:40:42] <runvnc> no I did not
[22:40:50] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Your code has an error :'(
[22:41:07] <runvnc> I already told him that
[22:41:17] <sudhansu> hey guys could u plz find out my error
[22:41:21] <systemfault> Back2Basics: I'll write a small testcase.
[22:42:29] <sudhansu> runvnc: could u tell me how to do that
[22:43:03] <runvnc> sudhansu either I already explained it to you or I explained it to another guy and you copied his jsfiddle link this time
[22:43:18] <runvnc> sorry guys I have to log
[22:44:34] <sudhansu> that iz my jsfiddle link only
[22:45:06] <nelsonkeating> anyone have an opinion on the best way to setup a form where the user will potentially enter a lot of records? I need to allow my users to add their friends names, birthdays and some other basic info?
[22:45:07] <nelsonkeating> i asked this question here.. if you look at the image you will immediately get what I'm talking about.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10760919/jquery-table-input-in-rails-app
[22:46:03] <systemfault> Back2Basics: http://jsfiddle.net/E4VSV/ It should work just like that.
[22:46:25] <Back2Basics> nelsonkeating: you could set up the same form and append to a json record.  but I'm afraid I can only help you so far...
[22:46:31] <systemfault> Back2Basics: It won't work on jsfiddle.net because the echo API doesn't accept json.
[22:48:08] <systemfault> Back2Basics: I'm a dumbass… contentType should be 'application/json'
[22:48:11] <Back2Basics> systemfault: well it doesn't work on webapp2 either.   keeps returning html post records instead of json
[22:48:23] <systemfault> What's webapp2?
[22:48:29] <Back2Basics> not your code you just posted
[22:49:04] <Back2Basics> webapp2 is a full stack framework written in python (replace apache insert webapp2)
[22:49:05] <systemfault> My contentType was wrong..  it should be "application/json; charset=utf-8"
[22:49:58] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/E4VSV/1/
[22:50:00] <systemfault> Like that
[22:51:21] <systemfault> If you open my link in jsfiddle then look at the 'post' request done in the network tab of the chrome dev tools, you'll see that everything is fine
[22:51:48] <systemfault> Good content-type, the request payload is what it should be...
[23:02:51] <Back2Basics> systemfault: I guess I'm not there yet.  there is a first problem to be dealt with.  I can't use the .ajax call  for some reason the thing is still sending with html  (even when I strip out all the structure and try a simple .ajax send.
[23:03:26] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Sending with html?
[23:04:13] <Back2Basics> systemfault: imagine a <form method="post" etc… with no javascript whatsoever.
[23:04:23] <Back2Basics> systemfault: that's what I have going.
[23:04:44] <systemfault> Perhaps the problem is on the backend...
[23:05:39] <Back2Basics> systemfault: wether or not to post in ajax+json or html post is up to the browser i believe.
[23:06:25] <systemfault> Back2Basics: The URL I gave you on jsfiddle.. do you see the content of the request it sends?
[23:06:33] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You can see it with the chrome dev tools.
[23:08:16] <systemfault> jsfiddle doesn't support JSON payloads..
[23:08:28] <Lucky--> . . .
[23:08:36] <Lucky--> you are doing it wrong then
[23:08:47] <Lucky--> i do ajax/json calls all the damn time
[23:08:48] <systemfault> Lucky--: Or it doesn't support it ;)
[23:08:54] <Lucky--> inside jsfiddle
[23:08:56] <systemfault> You're not sending json
[23:08:56] <Lucky--> otherwise i wouldnt use it
[23:08:59] <Lucky--> yea i am
[23:09:04] <systemfault> No you're not.
[23:09:06] <Lucky--> my web services
[23:09:08] <Lucky--> ithat i wrote
[23:09:09] <Lucky--> only take json
[23:09:10] <Back2Basics> if I put this http://jsfiddle.net/E4VSV/1/ in here http://jsfiddle.net/y7gQc/ replacing the .ajax call it doesn't work.
[23:09:34] <systemfault> Lucky--: Or your sending it as a parameter as standard form.
[23:10:44] <macmartine> Back2Basics: Excuse my not being totally caught up on this discussion, but how is this ajax request getting called? on form submit?
[23:11:09] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Why don't you fix the syntax error in your code?
[23:11:55] <Back2Basics> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/y7gQc/1/
[23:12:14] <systemfault> Another error...
[23:13:47] <macmartine> Back2Basics: is the current issue that the form is submitted as html not js?
[23:14:00] <Back2Basics> macmartine: yes
[23:14:32] <Back2Basics> I can't get the validate and then .ajax call to work.
[23:14:42] <macmartine> so, verify that preventDefault is working properly. if so, nothign should happen when you try to submit the form
[23:14:56] <macmartine> remove the ajax call, to simplify
[23:15:36] <macmartine> i'm not familiar with the validate method, but it seems clear that preventDefault isn't working
[23:16:21] <macmartine> and if preventDefault doesn't get called, then your form will still get submitted bia html
[23:16:27] <macmartine> *via
[23:18:45] <Back2Basics> I had the validate part working last week.  &*^*^&%%^$* ^%&*%^&*  %((&%^&^*(%^$$%#^
[23:19:11] <macmartine> Back2Basics: i would normally bind to "submit", but again, not familiar with the validate stuff
[23:22:33] <macmartine> Back2Basics: does an alert get hit from within the validate?
[23:23:49] <Back2Basics> macmartine: go http://appengine.protoboard.cl/ and try to type in a username without a password
[23:24:09] <Back2Basics> that's what happens.
[23:24:23] <macmartine> This field is required.
[23:24:29] <Back2Basics> yup
[23:25:05] <Back2Basics> normally instead of the .ajax call you would just say " form.submit();"
[23:25:41] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Why do you want to send json btw?
[23:25:47] <Back2Basics> but I'm trying to implement structure in the results which requires json or xml
[23:26:05] <systemfault> You can do whatever you want in your backend controller, no?
[23:26:12] <Back2Basics> systemfault: like a contact list
[23:26:15] <Back2Basics> yes
[23:27:08] <Back2Basics> systemfault: you can make firstname:me, lastname:me  (but you don't want to have to figure out different variables for firstname30:me, lastname30:me
[23:27:32] <systemfault> Ah.. I get it.
[23:27:49] <systemfault> So that's why you want to send the whole thing as json
[23:28:10] <Back2Basics> in python iterating over results is much easier.
[23:28:15] <systemfault> That way, you'll just send an array of "users"
[23:28:25] <Back2Basics> YUP
[23:28:38] <macmartine> python, ouch
[23:29:06] <Back2Basics> macmartine: not really … better than java. (I'm working on Google AppEngine.)
[23:29:09] <systemfault> Better that PHP imho..
[23:29:19] <macmartine> true
[23:29:31] <systemfault> I like Java.. so I'm biased.
[23:29:47] <Back2Basics> I like the python stuff.  Javascript and css I'm not to fond of.
[23:29:48] <systemfault> I just feel that java lacks features that C# has :/
[23:30:28] <Back2Basics> I just switch to ironpython which has the .net stuff.  (I've never needed it)
[23:51:12] <OffN> hi everyone, I have a jquery pop-up form, and i set it to submit with key pressed like that $("#"+self.idForm).keyup(function(e) (it works perfectly) but I forgot I had to exclude this behaviour when the focus is on a textarea, and $("#"+self.idForm).not("textarea") isnt working, can somone help me plz? :)
[23:57:26] <Back2Basics> systemfault: ty I have all new problems now :)
[23:57:34] <systemfault> :P
