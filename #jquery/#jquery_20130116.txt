[00:00:25] <mindis|wurk> what the hell. i updated jqueryui and when i .resize objects their width goes to zero when resizing vertically
[00:02:30] <mindis|wurk> it actually actively sets the css value to zero :|
[00:05:04] <kerozene> I don't get it. this is the only flip plugin that doesn't pause in the middle? http://blog.guilhemmarty.com/flippy/
[00:14:27] <tw2113> anyone know if it's possible to count instances of words in arrays?
[00:14:34] <tw2113> or at least easily
[00:15:57] <simius> loop through? or instances of words in strings which are in array?
[00:16:33] <Nebros> i know how in django (python) :D
[00:16:51] <tw2113> it's an odd situation
[00:17:16] <mindis|wurk> create a var with a value of zero. loop through the array, regexp the result to another array. add the length of the result array to the var. done.
[00:17:39] <tw2113> reading in some json twitter, grabbing the tweet text, removing punctuation, splitting by space, and shoving into an array
[00:18:10] <simius> so each index of the array is max one word? then just loop through and ++ on a var when word occurs
[00:18:13] <tw2113> would love to get counts of the words i've used :D
[00:18:46] <tw2113> if i want to add complexity, i'd want to count each word overall
[00:19:10] <simius> what do you meen?
[00:19:33] <tw2113> count how many times each word occurs
[00:19:40] <simius> oh, i see
[00:19:48] <mindis|wurk> seems pretty simple to do
[00:20:03] <ravenzz> tw2113 regexps?
[00:20:21] <ravenzz> as mindis|wurk suggested tought
[00:20:23] <ravenzz> +h
[00:20:33] <tw2113> i'll jsbin what i have
[00:21:45] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/ecomar/1/edit
[00:21:55] <tw2113> commented out on the left is the resulting list so far
[00:23:05] <mindis|wurk> if you had a single long string and you'd like to count the words you could do something like replacing commas and such with spaces, replace multiple spaces or tabs with a single space and then split by space, turn everything to lower case. then use associative arrays, using the words themselves as indices for quick checking if the word is added and then increasing the number when it is
[00:23:05] <mindis|wurk> encountered again and blahblah
[00:24:22] <tw2113> i think i'm at least halfway through that already mindis|wurk
[00:24:27] <mindis|wurk> apparently so
[00:25:14] <ravenzz> imo you could split using a regexp -.,()&?$#!\[\]{}"'
[00:25:35] <ravenzz> then map the array to an array of objects
[00:25:55] <ravenzz> each object contains the word and the occurrencies
[00:26:17] <tw2113> hmm
[00:26:29] <tw2113> this is just for shits n giggles, so no issue if i don't figure it out
[00:26:44] <tw2113> or at least not tonight
[00:27:37] <mindis|wurk> you've already solved most of it and what i said earlier helps you get the word count per word and adding a total counter is trivial since there's already a loop that counts words
[00:29:49] <cgcardona> tw2113: it's underscore and not jquery but this will allow you to count the instances of words http://underscorejs.org/#chaining
[00:31:16] <tw2113> hey cgcardona
[00:31:45] <cgcardona> hey dude. not sure if that exact example solves your problem but i bet something like it would
[00:32:55] <tw2113> i wouldn't argue against a good use of _'s to help
[00:33:28] <Nebros> i have this: return /^[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{6}$/.test(value); what i have to do when i will say [A-Z] but not SEF?
[00:33:37] <Ziggy`> When using jQuery UI Dialog, and setting the buttons, is there any way I could not use jQuery UI's button method to populate it. I've tried setting different classes, but it just makes it messy having to always add classes and overwrite styles.
[00:34:27] <Ziggy`> If I set the buttons as is -> buttons : { "Yep" : function() {}, "Nope" : function() {} } .. Yep becomes styled as a jQuery UI button.
[00:34:33] <Ziggy`> And Nope of course as well
[00:37:57] <ravenzz> tw2113 this was my idea http://jsfiddle.net/8wFm8/
[00:38:19] <Aqeel> |/back|
[00:38:22] <ravenzz> it has to be fixed though
[00:38:59] <tw2113> fixed in what way? remove its balls? that's cold
[00:39:01] <tw2113> :)
[00:39:05] <ravenzz> , index, arr <-
[00:39:15] <ravenzz> is useless
[00:39:22] <tw2113> hmm
[00:39:24] <ravenzz> it maps falsy stuff
[00:39:33] <ravenzz> the regex has to be stronger
[00:39:44] <tw2113> ah
[00:40:18] <tw2113> well, i'll save a copy anyway and see if it proves useful
[00:40:54] <tw2113> i know my stuff could adapt to it, and i could google enough to get stronger regex
[00:42:23] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/8wFm8/1/
[00:43:19] <tw2113> counts incidences of inside words too
[00:43:27] <tw2113> asd is inside other words and getting counted
[00:43:33] <tw2113> but it's workaroundable
[00:43:36] <ravenzz> ah k
[00:43:58] <tw2113> the things one does with his twitter data
[00:44:01] <ParanoidGal> tw2113: you've become quite the jquery rockstar

[00:45:54] <tw2113> ParanoidGal, i just win them over with my charming personality
[00:46:21] <ParanoidGal> tw2113: How could anyone resist that..
[00:46:55] <tw2113> even the gay guys love me :D
[00:51:28] <alexandernst_> Somebody should update the # topic :)
[00:52:30] <tw2113> i wish i knew who had the mod powers
[00:53:00] <ravenzz> ajpiano ? :p
[00:53:02] <alexandernst_> I saw the 2.0beta and I'm wondering if anybody ran some benchmarks on 1.8.x vs 2.0 on Chrome/FF. I mean, I know it must be faster because of the drop of support of oldIE, but *how* fast is it?
[00:53:34] <ravenzz> gnarf I guess
[00:53:52] <ravenzz> and other team members who hang out here
[00:54:49] <Ziggy`> I could just scream at jQuery UI right now.

[00:55:53] <b-ot> tw2113, I‚Äôll tell ajpiano about that.
[00:55:53] <bot-t> tw2113, Okay.
[00:56:08] <tw2113> booyah
[00:57:12] <kerozene> tw2113, ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/8wFm8/2/
[00:57:20] <Ziggy`> Okay, so using jQuery UI Dialog with buttons, is there any way to specificy the markup? Or simply not have it turn into jQuery UI Buttons?
[00:57:28] <kerozene> why not that way?
[00:57:47] <kerozene> saves you a whole regex search in the map function
[00:58:34] <tw2113> right after i close sublime text too :P
[00:59:00] <kerozene> sorry, just read the buffer :)
[00:59:19] <tw2113> it's all good
[00:59:39] <kerozene> maybe there's a good reason not to do it this way..
[00:59:51] <tw2113> i'll get it working one way or another, and thus get a list of popular words from 20k+ tweets to graph
[01:00:02] <tw2113> i don't need this part parmanently
[01:00:17] <kerozene> ravenzz: what do you think?
[01:01:25] <kerozene> also, why is there a blank word in mine?
[01:01:42] <tw2113> dunno on any parts, it's time for me to go to bed
[01:02:00] <kerozene> anyone?
[01:02:19] <tw2113> :p
[01:02:20] <tw2113> night
[01:02:25] <kerozene> nite

[01:11:00] <Nebros> i have this: return /^[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{6}$/.test(value); what i have to do when i will say [A-Z] but not 'SEF'? and i mean not S, E or F not allowed as the word SEF...
[01:31:34] <Ziggy`> I got frustrated with jQuery UI, so I just made my own hack, here it goes -> http://jsfiddle.net/h8Gyt/1/
[01:40:31] <mindis|wurk> oh god. how broken is the current jqueryui? i tried applying a simple onselect to the datepicker and it spews type errors
[01:41:18] <Cork> mindis|wurk: sounds like the best solution is to file a few bugs and downgrade
[01:44:12] <Nebros> one hour ago, since my first try to become an answer... ^^ again: http://jsfiddle.net/5TaqF/ here you can see in the first form, the user have to put in something like this SEF958614. in the second field i will have SEF blocked. and i mean SEF as a word and not the 3 letters... but how?

[01:48:25] <Cork> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod#namemethodmessage
[01:48:32] <Eviltwin> I don't know where you got sef: true from
[01:48:43] <Eviltwin> But since you didn't define that rule it always failed
[01:51:24] <Nebros> the sef function is there but not complete, i have there this text: "HERE I NEED SOMETHING LIKE: NOT THE WORD 'SEF'"... there i need to change that i have blocked the word sef ...
[01:51:42] <Nebros> but i have no plan how
[01:52:22] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/5TaqF/2/
[01:52:38] <Eviltwin> Now it can't start with "SEF"
[01:54:48] <Nebros> and when i will block sef, not key sensitive? like sEf, Sef, SeF...?
[01:55:16] <Eviltwin> That won't but this will: http://jsfiddle.net/5TaqF/3/
[01:55:40] <Cork> Nebros: sounds like you should read up on regex

[01:58:53] <Cork> the last link up there have loads of good information; i recommend reading it
[02:00:04] <untaken_> I was using jQuery("input[name=cancel_domain_button]").live("click", function () {    but now .live is not supported, What should I change this too?
[02:00:35] <Eviltwin> untaken_: Look at http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:00:42] <Eviltwin> It's explained not far from the top
[02:01:17] <untaken_> Eviltwin: thanks
[02:03:05] <tbws> Is there a reason why jquery would return 0 on outerWidth() and offset() when referencing a block element thats visible?
[02:03:41] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ tbws
[02:03:42] <bot-t> tbws, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:03:47] <sCoRpi_> tbws: can you post some code?
[02:03:58] <sCoRpi_> ^what he made the bot say
[02:05:57] <tbws> sCoRpi_ I can ye but it's really this simple: http://jsfiddle.net/HmkNX/
[02:06:43] <Eviltwin> Because it is
[02:06:45] <Eviltwin> See: http://jsfiddle.net/HmkNX/1/
[02:08:37] <tbws> Eviltwin: Not in the context of the document im using + it's also returning 0 on outerWidth();
[02:09:39] <untaken_> Eviltwin: this don't seem to be working this new way. I have changed it to jQuery("input[name=edit_domain_button]").on("click", null, function () {    and it doesn't do anything
[02:09:39] <Eviltwin> tbws: The purpose of the demo is that it's supposed to show something that's not working properly
[02:09:42] <Eviltwin> It's working properly here
[02:09:53] <Nebros> moin sCoRpi_ :)
[02:10:00] <Eviltwin> untaken_: Yup
[02:10:22] <untaken_> Eviltwin: can you see what I am doing wrong?
[02:10:27] <Eviltwin> untaken_: Go here: http://api.jquery.com/live/ Look at the lines the end with "// jQuery 1.3+" and "// jQuery 1.7+"
[02:10:33] <untaken_> ok
[02:10:37] <Eviltwin> See how they're different
[02:10:48] <Eviltwin> It's more than just changing "live" to "on"
[02:10:58] <Eviltwin> The selector changes
[02:11:23] <untaken_> yea, I am reading... just trying to get my head around what a selector is in this context
[02:12:33] <Eviltwin> Look at the second gray box of code on that page
[02:12:47] <Eviltwin> And where it says "a.offsite" pretend it says "input[name=edit_domain_button]"
[02:12:53] <tbws> Eviltwin: It isn't working for me on specific elements which are literrally that simple.
[02:13:49] <Eviltwin> tbws: Is it inside the <body> or is it inside other elements?
[02:14:47] <tbws> inside other elements
[02:14:58] <Eviltwin> Is it possible any of those other elements are hidden?
[02:16:17] <tbws> nope
[02:16:51] <mindis|wurk> what's the simplest way to check if two dates are on the same week?
[02:17:03] <untaken_> Eviltwin: I se what your saying, but if I change it to that, it don't work either. I have currently experimented with jQuery("input[name=edit_domain_button]").on("click", "input[name=edit_domain_button]", function () {

[02:21:57] <untaken_> thanks
[02:23:54] <Nebros> hmm but now i become the standard text "Please enter at least 3 characters." and not "You need at least 3 characters."
[02:24:52] <tbws> Eviltwin: Thank you for your help! turns out another piece of functionality is dealing with that element as the result of a plugin of some kind. No idea which one but I have somewhere to go. :D Cheers for your time!

[02:45:58] <Clex> CodesStuff: about a week ago.
[02:47:07] <theresajayne_> BTW i found out what my problem was, it was the ajax call was removing one form and adding another which was duplicating any form buttons outside the div

[02:49:19] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: Erm, as far as I know you can only prompt the user with the file select dialog, not a folder one
[02:49:43] <CodesStuff> Actually, with the recent addition of blobs and stuff it might be possible. Brb googling
[02:49:50] <Nebros> i have a lame page with 5 tables. the problem is, they need diffrent db's from diffrent server. how can i set the page, that it have to view a table when it is loadet? the page have nothing to scroll down and no pics. i found something like this:http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload can i use something like this for my probrem?

[02:52:17] <bibi23> hi, I'm trying to understand javascript scopes, but I don't understand this : http://pastebin.com/w6nSe7ue , do you have any clue? thx
[02:52:23] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff thanks will take a look at it
[02:53:02] <CodesStuff> bibi23: Since the callback is in a function and id isn't defined as a global variable, you can't access it from within that function.
[02:53:26] <CodesStuff> You have a couple options. A) Pass the "id" in as a parameter, or B) Define "id" as a global variable.
[02:53:29] <Clex> nooneeeee: "not" must be in the selector, it's not a method.
[02:53:50] <Clex> It would be .not otherwise, not :not.
[02:53:59] <CodesStuff> Often times people just toss globals within the window.* object, although if you drop the "var" in the definition it MIGHT work, bibi23.
[02:54:37] <nooneeeee> Clex it's same dont work.
[02:55:19] <nooneeeee> Clex can u show me your suggestion?
[02:55:20] <Clex> nooneeeee: I can't help you if you don't show your code.
[02:55:35] <CodesStuff> ?doesn't work
[02:55:35] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.

[02:58:41] <Clex> ?doesn't work
[02:58:42] <b-ot> Clex, @work: RT @PolarBearFarm: "I encompass, and I eclipse" http://t.co/3r0Xni4v
[02:58:51] <nooneeeee> Doesnt work.
[02:58:53] <CodesStuff> t432: Is it ALWAYS going to be two works? Ex: "the cat"
[02:59:27] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff hmm the Filesystem sound sinteresting but if I got it right, correct me if I'm wrong, the FileSystem only creates a folder to store data? But I need the user to select a folder where I can get data with node.js
[02:59:53] <t432> CodesStuff: I'll be checkink for username with no spaces in between
[03:00:22] <bibi23> CodesStuff: ok, setting a global variable works, but what do you mean by passing as an argument, jQuery is calling this callback function not me, I don't really see how this second solution should be done?
[03:01:16] <CodesStuff> bibi23: Passing in the "id" in the callback
[03:01:34] <CodesStuff> t432: Why not just use .contains or .search?
[03:02:18] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: Oh, it's for your box. Uh, honestly you're better off creating your own little directory tree widget (or finding one thats open source)
[03:02:24] <t432> CodesStuff:like this....  foo.contains(" ")?
[03:03:10] <szonek> hello!
[03:03:10] <CodesStuff> ?contains
[03:03:10] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[03:03:15] <szonek> i have a #center (div) which is vertically centered in a #container (div), when i do slideDown() on a #hidden (div) which is inside #container, height of container obviously increases and #center is not any more in a center (it's centered by margin-top). any idea how i can animate margin-top increase while #hidden div is sliding down?
[03:03:35] <CodesStuff> Not sure tbh. For validation I usually do it in hardcoded JS t432.
[03:03:50] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: Take a look at this http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/archived/jquery-fileTree/demo/
[03:05:12] <CodesStuff> ?animate @szonek
[03:05:12] <bot-t> szonek, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:05:34] <CodesStuff> Just adjust appropriately during the ticks and you should be fine, szonek! :P
[03:07:10] <szonek> CodesStuff: you mean steps?
[03:07:33] <CodesStuff> Yep.
[03:08:37] <bibi23> CodesStuff: yes I see what you mean, I've just tried to implement it the way it is stated here : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/passing-local-variables-to-callback-functions, but it doesn't do the trick, here is the pastebin : http://pastebin.com/geWzN9xk
[03:09:35] <CodesStuff> bibi23: You should look into using jsfiddle! It's so much nicer.
[03:10:00] <Exx2xxO> I don't get it...there is a select file dialog, but no select folder dialog? Is there a way how to edit the select file dialog? CodesStuff looks interesting but there must be a way without plugins :( I just need a simple way to let the user select a specific folder and send this to node.js which works with it ... Therefor a plugin is way to much for this simple action...
[03:10:13] <ingerasu> Salut
[03:10:19] <ingerasu> e cineva on
[03:10:20] <ingerasu> ?
[03:11:01] <ingerasu> !seen a
[03:11:01] <b-ot> ingerasu, I saw a 17h 33m ago, changing nick to Guest66280.
[03:11:09] <CodesStuff> bibi23: It worked for me. Are you sure you're including jQuery? Try wrapping a $(document).ready(function(){ // your code }); around it
[03:11:25] <ingerasu> ma ajuta careva
[03:11:36] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: I honestly don't think it's possible outside the scope of a browser extension =\
[03:14:25] <bibi23> CodesStuff: yes I am, I don't think I can do this, this code is in a function, there were another issue, the request were async so I set it to false (the id value was logged before the request actually finishes so it always had the old value), but even then it still only works with the global variable thing and not the second solution
[03:14:26] <CodesStuff> bibi23: http://jsfiddle.net/xCeD4/ - make sure you've got firebug/your JS debugger open (f12)
[03:14:50] <CodesStuff> So put the log function within the callback?
[03:15:11] <CodesStuff> Or call another function FROM your callback, maybe.
[03:19:04] <rindolf> Hi all.
[03:19:09] <CodesStuff> 'sup
[03:19:17] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/automated-tests/ - how can I test asynchronous code with setTimeout here - http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/automated-tests/
[03:19:19] <rindolf> CodesStuff: hi.
[03:20:06] <bibi23> CodesStuff: yep, but it's not so much about doing the best thing, I'm just trying to understand the scopes when it comes to a callback function,  even if I don't use any of your solution, I can grab the value (see http://jsfiddle.net/xCeD4/1/), but apparently it's different when it comes to edit it and make the new value available outside the callback scope once it's called.
[03:20:15] <CodesStuff> Are you asking how to automatically ping that server rindolf?
[03:20:33] <rindolf> CodesStuff: no.
[03:21:45] <rindolf> CodesStuff: I'm using QUnit and want to test http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js/web-fc-solve.js , but it uses .setTimeout.
[03:21:47] <CodesStuff> bibi23: http://jsfiddle.net/xCeD4/2/
[03:22:12] <rindolf> CodesStuff: maybe I should refactor it to use steps and pass back to the UI, which will do the .setTimeout.
[03:22:43] <CodesStuff> rindolf: Not fully understanding your problem, but it sounds like you know what to do ;)
[03:23:32] <anew> rindolf what's the problem there ?
[03:23:49] <rindolf> anew: I'm using .setTimeout to make sure the GUI remains responsive.
[03:24:01] <rindolf> anew: but it seems the tests are synchronous.
[03:24:16] <CodesStuff> rindolf: Responsive - like bootstrap? Or doesn't freeze up?
[03:24:31] <rindolf> CodesStuff: doesn't freeze up.
[03:24:39] <rindolf> CodesStuff: i.e: can handle other events.
[03:25:26] <CodesStuff> Hmm.. If you made *everything* event-driven it might be a better option, no?
[03:25:33] <bibi23> CodesStuff: yep that one is working, it outputs test and then yoloo, but the second solution doesn't (this one is the global variable IIRC)
[03:26:36] <bibi23> CodesStuff: nevermind! I was doing something wrong
[03:26:40] <bibi23> your both solutions work
[03:26:43] <bibi23> thx ;)
[03:26:47] <CodesStuff> bibi23: Notice how I didn't put "var" in front of the "id" definition?
[03:26:55] <CodesStuff> that *usually* tosses it in the global scope
[03:28:54] <rindolf> CodesStuff: what?
[03:29:05] <rindolf> CodesStuff: I'm trying to test my code.
[03:35:48] <Zak> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[03:36:07] <Zak> it says that .on is the preferred method, but there are no examples for it (and yet there are examples for .bind)
[03:36:11] <Zak> am i missing something?
[03:38:53] <CodesStuff> Zak: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8065305/whats-the-difference-between-on-and-live-or-bind
[03:39:08] <Zak> thanks CodesStuff
[03:39:25] <CodesStuff> Not gonna lie, I'm pretty good at googling.
[03:39:36] <Zak> yeah, my bad. That's my usual starting point
[03:39:53] <Zak> I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty tired
[03:40:04] <CodesStuff> No worries - we've all been there.
[03:40:39] <Zak> i think $.proxy is going to be my new best friend....
[03:41:54] <cache_q> hi there
[03:41:57] <CodesStuff> I've never actually used that, Zak
[03:42:32] <CodesStuff> Hey there, cache_q. State your question, and supply a relevant jsfiddle if possible!
[03:42:49] <cache_q> how can i trigger such code programmtically?
[03:43:03] <cache_q>  $("form").submit(function() { $(":submit", this).attr("disabled", true); });
[03:43:26] <cache_q> $('form').trigger('submit') doesn't work
[03:44:34] <cache_q>  err, i mean "trigger such event"
[03:44:50] <CodesStuff> Uh, you just did it.
[03:44:57] <CodesStuff> You had the event for onSubmit there
[03:45:16] <CodesStuff> if you call the .submit() function it SHOULD fire
[03:45:19] <NodeX> unless your form is dynamnicaly cretaed
[03:45:23] <NodeX> created *
[03:45:36] <NodeX> in which case you need to use on()
[03:45:55] <CodesStuff> NodeX: I learn something new everyday. I probably would have just re-scanned the DOM lol
[03:46:12] <cache_q> CodesStuff: but my button is still active, it becames inactive only when i click on it
[03:46:25] <NodeX> CodesStuff : we all learn new things every day
[03:46:43] <NodeX> cache_q : that's because that's what your code does lol
[03:46:44] <CodesStuff> cache_q: Make a jsfiddle of it for me to play with, then!
[03:46:55] <bibi23> CodesStuff: I can't believe this! Could you take a look at that? http://jsfiddle.net/xCeD4/4/ Do you know why?
[03:47:15] <CodesStuff> Sure thing bibi23. What's the issue?
[03:47:25] <CodesStuff> oh
[03:48:05] <CodesStuff> bibi23: It's because you're passing in "id" as data
[03:48:51] <bibi23> CodesStuff: yes it looks like, so I guess the only safe solution in this case is the global variable?
[03:49:27] <CodesStuff> Kind of, yeah. NodeX: What say you on the subject?
[03:49:54] <CodesStuff> (he's trying to understand how JS's scope works as far as globals/anonymous functions go)
[03:50:54] <cache_q> NodeX: my code binds form submitions event to disable submit button after form submition, what i want is to trigger that submition event to disable butt programmtically
[03:51:11] <cache_q> a bit complicated :)
[03:51:51] <CodesStuff> cache_q: .submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); //disable// }
[03:52:39] <CodesStuff> if its not disabled, prevent default and disable it, then submit, otherwise just let it run
[03:52:49] <CodesStuff> kinda ghetto, but it will work
[03:58:41] <cache_q> changing my event to:
[03:58:43] <cache_q> $(":submit").on("click", function(){$(this).attr("disabled", true)})
[03:58:47] <cache_q> and then
[03:58:49] <cache_q> $(":submit").triggerHandler("click")
[03:58:54] <cache_q> did what i want
[03:59:21] <CodesStuff> ^^
[04:02:15] <Nebros> i have a lame page with 5 tables. the problem is, they need diffrent db's from diffrent server. how can i set the page, that it shows me what is already loaded? the page have nothing to scroll down and no pics. i found this:http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload can i use something like this for my probrem?
[04:02:35] <seutje> cache_q: consider binding to the submit event on the form instead of the click on the button
[04:02:49] <seutje> cache_q: there's multiple ways to submit a form without clicking
[04:04:02] <cache_q> seutje: i can't do that untli i know the way to programmtically trigger form submition event without actual form submition
[04:04:18] <cache_q> with click event it's easy: $(":submit").triggerHandler("click")
[04:04:52] <cache_q> but $("form").submit() doesn't trigger button disabling event
[04:07:10] <cache_q> seutje: can you suggest something?
[04:10:10] <seutje> cache_q: $('form').on('submit', function() { $(this).find(':submit').attr('disabled', true); });
[04:10:52] <seutje> I'm not sure if disabling the submit button disabled all ways of submitting a form
[04:11:11] <cache_q> seutje: and to programmatically trigger that event i nedd to execute what?
[04:11:35] <seutje> $('form').submit()
[04:11:45] <cache_q> seutje: ohcourse not, double submition should be secured on serverside, it just for eyecandy
[04:11:55] <seutje> or $(':submit').click();
[04:11:59] <andern> so. i have a table containing a row (a member), and each member has several payments. these payments are separate rows. is there any way i can make these rows a child of the member? because now all payments in the entire system are siblings of every member. what i need is for each member be able to do member.children(".payment"), and that should give me a list of only the payments belonging to that member
[04:11:59] <seutje> ... I think
[04:12:05] <andern> how can i achieve this?
[04:12:29] <cache_q> seutje:  $(this).find(':submit') ---> $(':submit', this)
[04:12:51] <andern> i tried making a <div> around each member as a member container, but turns out html doesnt like divs inside tables :S
[04:13:01] <Exx2xxO> I love it. When I try to send an ajax request to an ip-adress(127.0.0.1) the script stops working. What am I doing wrong?
[04:13:01] <seutje> andern: tables aren't designed for that
[04:13:08] <seutje> afaik
[04:13:22] <seutje> andern: it's usually faked by having the child-rows indented
[04:13:29] <Exx2xxO> as url there is just : "http://127.0.0.1:1337"
[04:13:46] <CodesStuff> 1337 PORT
[04:13:48] <Whiskey> How do i get the actully borwser version whit jQuery?
[04:13:50] <seutje> cache_q: whichever suits your fancy, they're functional equivalents nowadays
[04:13:50] <CodesStuff> you be hackin' bro
[04:13:58] <CodesStuff> Whiskey: parse the user agent
[04:14:27] <andern> seutje: they are kind of indented because i put the row span of the member equal to the number of payments + 1
[04:14:54] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff right the Port is from node.js the server running on my pc
[04:15:03] <Whiskey> don¬¥t jQuery almost do what whit $browser?
[04:15:18] <seutje> Whiskey: UA stuff is deprecated from jQuery afaik
[04:15:25] <andern> seutje: you cant see what i'm trying to achieve here if you are interested: http://tvroid.org/medlemmer/
[04:15:43] <seutje> Whiskey: u can get at the UA string by using navigator.userAgent, I think
[04:16:34] <Whiskey> yeh i know that :)
[04:16:59] <scr4ve> Hey folks! I have a strange occurrence with 1.9.0 that $( $el.get(0) ).data() == {} is not equal to $el.data() == {actual data}
[04:17:17] <Exx2xxO> This is all what I got in this damn script nothing special but jquery trys to annoy me as always : http://pastebin.com/m5pP8jA5
[04:17:20] <scr4ve> Based on my understanding of this topic, this shoulnd't happen at all. Is there something I am missing?
[04:17:53] <seutje> andern: so what's the problem?
[04:18:04] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: That semicolon supposed to be there? Also, y u no object-ify the postdata?
[04:18:04] <b-ot> (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[04:18:05] <CodesStuff> :[
[04:18:14] <CodesStuff> ?y u no
[04:18:14] <b-ot> (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[04:18:17] <andern> seutje: member.children(".payment") would now return 6 instead of 3
[04:18:19] <bot-t> CodesStuff, 83 - Search Results ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/search?ticket=on&changeset=on&wiki=on&q=erro&page=83&noquickjump=1
[04:18:38] <seutje> well, yeah
[04:18:47] <seutje> scope it with an each if u need to
[04:18:54] <CodesStuff> testing - disregard. y u no y u no y u no
[04:18:54] <b-ot> (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[04:19:02] <CodesStuff> Smart bot :]
[04:19:14] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff I don't get your answer xD Which semicolon and what do you mean with object-ify...
[04:19:43] <CodesStuff> after the error func, and "user" in the postdata. {"user": "val"}
[04:19:53] <andern> seutje: what about a table inside each member cell? is that considered "bad"?
[04:20:28] <seutje> I suppose
[04:20:32] <Nebros> i have a lame page with 5 tables. the problem is, they need diffrent db's from diffrent server. how can i set the page, that it shows me what is already loaded? the page have nothing to scroll down and no pics. i found this:http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload can i use something like this for my probrem?
[04:21:24] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff there has to be a semicolon, or am I wrong? and the "user" is just something to send just for testing :D
[04:21:59] <Exx2xxO> thanks CodesStuff the semicolon was the problem :D
[04:22:17] <CodesStuff> :)
[04:28:37] <dirkpennings> How do I remove a specific key/page from the browser history? with jQuery / JavaScript?
[04:29:14] <Nebros> have no one an idea how i can solve my problem? :(
[04:29:26] <CodesStuff> Er.. dirkpennings: Unless you code an extension you can't..
[04:30:31] <dirkpennings> CodesStuff: ok.. pity :) thanks
[04:31:08] <CodesStuff> \o/
[04:31:21] <CodesStuff> Nebros: What do you mean? You want to see what data is loaded?
[04:31:36] <CodesStuff> You should collect that data before even rendering the page tbh
[04:32:26] <Nebros> thats not possible. :(
[04:32:41] <CodesStuff> How is it not possible? lol
[04:33:33] <Nebros> i cant get ready the data before loading the page
[04:33:48] <CodesStuff> Okay. what language are you writing the server-sided stuff in?
[04:34:32] <Nebros> sql
[04:34:42] <CodesStuff> I mean how are you *pulling* it.
[04:34:51] <CodesStuff> PHP? Node? Ruby? Python?
[04:34:58] <Clex> Nebros: you need to understand difference between client-side and server-side code.
[04:35:00] <Nebros> python
[04:35:19] <Nebros> ok mom...
[04:35:37] <CodesStuff> lol
[04:35:43] <CodesStuff> I WANT TO HELP YOU SO MUCH NOW
[04:36:26] <Nebros> you call a page, that page will be rendering from server and call the data out from the db's and give it back. the page (client side) display then the page correct
[04:36:30] <Clex> Nebros: alright, do it yourself then.
[04:36:59] <Nebros> i mean with mom, i need longer to tip a text. im not good in englisch. ^^
[04:38:16] <CodesStuff> just have proxy.py?server={SERVER_ID} return a JSON object that has a callback to say "this db is loaded"
[04:38:22] <CodesStuff> check for that when loading data
[04:38:29] <CodesStuff> if everything is loaded, do nothing
[04:38:38] <Nebros> im using python / django... i think the problem is the rendering is serverside and it give the answer back to client when it is finished loadet
[04:38:43] <Christer> Does anyone know if its possible to make the gzip library compress .json files in ajax requests ?
[04:40:28] <Clex> Christer: your server does it already if it is supported.
[04:40:45] <CodesStuff> He *might* need to specify it in the header ouput
[04:41:20] <Nebros> i have a views.py. in there is: def webpage(request): ..blabla... return render_to_response
[04:41:32] <Christer> Yeah i probably need to specify it in the header output.. but how do you do that with files?
[04:41:36] <Clex> Christer: check the Accept-Encoding header out.
[04:41:53] <CodesStuff> ^
[04:42:03] <Clex> You don't have to do it yourself in any way.
[04:42:24] <AlbinoGeek> How would I go about getting all the classes that $(this) has, excluding one I already know of? (the event caller)
[04:43:09] <Clex> AlbinoGeek: console.log()?
[04:43:25] <AlbinoGeek> Clex: Uhh what?  Not even related exactly...  Here, let me explain.
[04:43:25] <AlbinoGeek> ie: <div class="hoverMenu makes"/>   $(this).attr('class') /* but exclude "hoverMenu" */
[04:44:20] <AlbinoGeek> An ugly way would be to .attr('class') and substr on indexOf ' '... but yeah, very ugly.
[04:44:27] <AlbinoGeek> jQuery doesn't expose a much less ugly way?
[04:44:40] <Nebros> ok, the server give the request, when he is finish with loading. did i see this correct?
[04:45:02] <Clex> AlbinoGeek: it's gonna be a trick like that anyway.
[04:45:23] <AlbinoGeek> Clex: Well, jQuery has no .getClasses() that might return an array for example?
[04:45:39] <Clex> .attr('class').split(" ")
[04:45:59] <AlbinoGeek> Clex: .attr('class').split(" ")[1] then would be much less ugly than the substr and indexOf :P
[04:46:14] <Clex> Well, you can't really be sure of the order.
[04:46:31] <AlbinoGeek> Clex: The order will be as defined as per HTML yes?
[04:46:38] <AlbinoGeek> Clex: (not being programmatically changed.)
[04:46:49] <Clex> Then, yes.
[04:46:49] <Cork> or just .prop('classList')
[04:47:00] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Will that return an array the same?
[04:47:10] <Cork> ?mdc classList
[04:47:11] <bot-t> Cork, element.classList - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - classList returns a token list of the class attribute of the element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.classList
[04:47:25] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Ahh, saves the split, thanks.
[04:47:41] <AlbinoGeek> Oh, element.  so this.prop and not $(this).prop ?
[04:48:33] <AlbinoGeek> Nevermind, $(this).
[04:53:25] <coachz> Anyone here use requirejs ?  I'm trying to get it to lazy load
[05:10:13] <Christer> Does anyone here know how to get the server to return a gzip of file.json in a ajax request ?
[05:10:56] <Cork> Christer: its a server config
[05:11:07] <Cork> it depends on what you're running
[05:11:19] <Exx2xxO> I'm trying a simple ajax post request and try to answer that with my node server. The request is send, the server response with a json but my jquery ajax still says: Error. It says the response from server were an error and I don't know why? Can anyone help?
[05:11:22] <Cork> ex. apache configs it through its .htaccess
[05:12:57] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: Try changing it to a GET
[05:13:07] <CodesStuff> then go to it normally to see if it works
[05:15:09] <Exx2xxO> CodesStuff tried everything but the jquery still says: Server response = Error
[05:15:12] <Christer> Cork, yeah im trying. and i found this: http://pastebin.com/7jQS84Ey
[05:15:22] <Exx2xxO> But the response is correct
[05:15:22] <Christer> But it still does not compress the json file
[05:15:40] <Clex> Christer: you're not gonna get it compressed.
[05:15:44] <CodesStuff> Exx2xxO: Got a live page up? If need be, port forward your localmachine so I can take a peek.
[05:15:48] <Clex> How do you check if it's gzipped?
[05:15:57] <Christer> Headers
[05:16:16] <Christer> and transfer vs content size
[05:16:51] <CodesStuff> Christer: <?php header("Content Type: application/x-javascript");?>
[05:16:54] <CodesStuff> or something
[05:17:04] <CodesStuff> apache should take it from there
[05:17:35] <Christer> sec. ill post the script.
[05:18:09] <Christer> Right now im trying: http://pastebin.com/FqUW9PAT
[05:18:16] <Cork> Christer: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html
[05:19:36] <Christer> I manage to do it when i can set the header! But when i want to get a file directly like this one.. (alle.json) Then i cant set the header in a php script.. i need something to handle that on an overall webserver basis. like .htaccess - But with the script i sent, that doesnt work either.
[05:20:21] <Clex> Christer: x(
[05:20:25] <Clex> You don't need to do that.
[05:20:52] <Clex> It's gonna be gzipped over application/json
[05:21:13] <Christer> well, then it should have been gzipped then shouldnt it?  but its not :(
[05:21:21] <Clex> Check with tcpdump or ngrep. Can you see plain text?
[05:21:44] <Cork> Christer: how are you checking that it isn't?
[05:22:11] <Christer> The filesize is 14.53mb -
[05:22:20] <Christer> The transfer size is 14.53 mb
[05:22:24] <Cork> ah
[05:22:35] <Christer> the transfer size should have been down to around 5 mb.
[05:22:50] <Clex> Where do you get this "tranfer size"?
[05:23:03] <Cork> actually i'm not sure if the browser lists before or after its gunziped
[05:23:22] <Christer> Developer tools in Google Chrome, Google Speedtest & Firebug in Firefox,
[05:23:34] <Christer> It lists both.
[05:23:39] <Cork> those might be after unziping
[05:24:19] <Christer> No, transfer size does not change after unzipping.
[05:24:33] <Clex> Christer: do you have a Content-Encoding in your response headers?
[05:24:49] <Christer> No,
[05:24:55] <Christer> Thats what im trying to achieve
[05:25:07] <Christer> To get the content encoding set on files..
[05:25:11] <Clex> Then do you have a Accept-Encoding set to gzip in your request headers?
[05:25:17] <Christer> Yes
[05:25:42] <Clex> Then your server isn't gzipping, indeed.
[05:25:49] <Christer> Im allready doing this on a direct print to the page. where it kinda gives me the correct values for, and it gzips it.
[05:26:10] <Christer> But since the database request is huge, im saving the printed json to a json. file
[05:27:27] <Christer> Because, when printing from a direct script i can set the header like this: header('Content-Encoding: gzip');
[05:28:20] <Christer> But i cant set that header like that in a file. so i need something that tells my server " Hey, if someone is trying to get a .json file - gzip it and send it over to them"
[05:28:39] <jacta> How can I target first ul and then last li in the first ul in #Menu -
[05:28:44] <jacta> does it make sense?
[05:28:53] <Clex> You're having an OSI problem.
[05:29:53] <Cork> jacta: 'ul:first li:last' or $('ul').first().children().last()
[05:30:52] <Cork> Christer: you might have to configure php to use zlib
[05:30:54] <johndoe> Cork: which method is the preferred one?
[05:31:08] <jacta> Thanks Cork :)
[05:31:14] <Cork> johndoe: the last one will be a little bit faster
[05:31:30] <johndoe> but the first one is more readable? :)
[05:31:33] <Cork> cause : selectors are slow, but it normally doesn't matter much
[05:31:40] <Cork> no both is about as reliable
[05:31:53] <johndoe> thanks :)
[05:32:10] <Cork> the first one causes more code to execute, and thats why its slower
[05:36:59] <seutje> guess u could use first-of-type ans keep it in the qsa family
[05:37:05] <seutje> s/ans/and
[05:39:43] <ajpiano> ?tell tw2113 thanks re: topic change ping
[05:39:43] <b-ot> ajpiano, I‚Äôll tell tw2113 about that.
[05:39:43] <bot-t> (4 hours 43 mins ago) <tw2113> tell ajpiano topic is in need of version update. I know you know who can do it
[05:39:43] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[05:39:48] <b-ot> ajpiano, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[05:40:04] <ajpiano> b-ot: read
[05:40:10] <vlad_starkov> Question: it turned out that in jQuery 1.9.0 the `$.browser` method has been removed. Is it possible to put it back as a plugin?
[05:41:13] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[05:42:20] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: perfect! Thanks.
[05:53:24] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: is possible to put back only one deprecated method?
[05:54:10] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: but it's recommended to use $.browser https://github.com/jquery/jquery-browser
[05:54:21] <ajpiano> i mean, but it's recommended to use Migrate
[05:54:25] <ajpiano> why don't you want to use Migrate
[06:00:08] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: may be I do something wrong, but after I added Migrate right after the jQuery my app became so sloooow
[06:02:18] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I'm Firefox on OSX
[06:02:39] <ajpiano> you're gonna need to quantify that a bit better
[06:02:53] <ajpiano> "got slow" is not something we can do anything about
[06:03:43] <ajpiano> but if you can put together some demonstrable cases on http://jsperf.com showing that migrate has seriously adverse perf impacts, then it's something we could look at
[06:04:14] <ajpiano> the point is, it's called Migrate for a reason... you're suppsed to use it to migrate your old code to better, more modern techniques
[06:04:25] <ajpiano> not throw it in there and keep browser sniffing until kingdom come
[06:09:49] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I think it's not possible for me to build demo cases for that. Migrate actually required due to the http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html does not support jQuery 1.9.0. I think it is easier for me to rewrite a bit TimeEntry plugin to do not use Migrate.
[06:10:39] <ajpiano> you don't think it's possible to demonstrate the degradation in app performance?
[06:11:03] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: don't you reckon that if *we* were to attempt to remedy it, we would also have to quanitfy it?
[06:11:19] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: what deprecated features does the plugin use
[06:11:41] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I use Backbone + Chaplin frameworks and quite rich application structure. I don't know where the bottle neck here.
[06:11:59] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: $.browser
[06:12:05] <ajpiano> :/
[06:12:21] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: but only after dropping in migrate do you notice a performance difference?
[06:12:32] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: 1st) you can just copy the section on jquery browser out of migrate
[06:13:01] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: yep. And the performance issue only appears on Firefox, but Safari and Chrome are ok.
[06:13:04] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/src/core.js#L31-L62
[06:13:41] <ajpiano> it could be due to a lot of things
[06:13:54] <ajpiano> profiling your app with and without the migrate plugin in there, would be quite useful
[06:16:27] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: Ok. Stay tuned.
[06:18:41] <ajpiano> sounds good
[06:21:40] <jklaus> hey guys.. if I wanted to select the 'selected' option within a specific select given the select's ID.. how would one go about writing that jQ statement
[06:21:55] <jklaus> Would it look something like this?
[06:21:56] <jklaus> $('select[id=**]').children().each(function (){if(this.selected){return this;}})
[06:22:05] <ajpiano> $("#foo option:selected")
[06:22:27] <jklaus> really?   that easy?
[06:22:57] <ajpiano> oh you need to chop off your right arm
[06:23:17] <jklaus> Ohh.. to please the sharepoint gods?
[06:23:24] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: strange thing happened. I reduce Migrate to only $.browser support. Then Firebug was crashed and I restart Firefox. Now it works pretty normal without performance issues.
[06:23:51] <ajpiano> ok
[06:23:59] <jklaus> well thanks for that bit of code.. going to try it.
[06:24:10] <ajpiano> so that fixes your problem but gives us no insight into what possible slowdowns migrate could be causing
[06:24:12] <ajpiano> alas
[06:26:20] <jklaus> ajpiano.. thanks again man
[06:26:26] <ajpiano> no prob jklaus
[06:27:16] <jklaus> ajpiano, just so I understand how jQuery functions with an input like that..  To me it seems that the first bit is it searching for the id, then the space signifies a new search within the return of the first?
[06:27:29] <ajpiano> same as css
[06:27:34] <ajpiano> #foo .bar
[06:27:47] <jklaus> ahh
[06:27:48] <ajpiano> is all elements with the class of bar inside an element with the id of foo
[06:28:00] <ajpiano> space is a descendant selector
[06:28:05] <jklaus> ok
[06:28:17] <jklaus> Thanks again.. I'm still fairly green with JS/jQ
[06:30:44] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I'll struggle to stay in touch with jQuery community if I'll find any issues. By the way, I noticed that my dropdown menu takes too much time to be rendered(that's why I actually updated to 1.9.0). As Chrome profiler shows, the `elemData.handle` eats most time. What could be cause of the problem?
[06:31:29] <ajpiano> sounds like the dropdown menu has some inefficient code in it
[06:31:57] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: pretty possible. Is it possible to figure out the bottle neck?
[06:34:07] <ajpiano> paste your code and i can take a look
[06:34:41] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: jQuery.event.dispatch --> elemData.handle
[06:34:50] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: sec
[06:35:04] <marcules> Hi there
[06:38:41] <scar> is there a way to wait until everything is completed in an action inside on/click without nesting .ajax() calls inside each other using complete: arg?
[06:39:00] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: the profiler points to renderAllItems method https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin/blob/master/src/chaplin/views/collection_view.coffee#L272-L305 I'm not sure that the problem is in jQuery. Tell me if so, please.
[06:39:35] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: my gut instinct is that it almost definitely isn't in jquery
[06:40:16] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I see)
[06:42:08] <ajpiano> are the views you're creating  have a lot of event handlers?
[06:42:10] <ajpiano> do*
[06:42:29] <jklaus> if I wanted a select to trigger some JS when a selection is made what trigger would that be.. obviously not onclick
[06:42:46] <ajpiano> jklaus: use the change event
[06:43:04] <jklaus> onchange?
[06:43:13] <ajpiano> $("#foo").on("change", function(e) { console.log( $(e.target).val() ); });
[06:43:30] <ajpiano> jklaus: you shouldn't use inline obtrusive js handlers such as onclick and onchange
[06:44:40] <jklaus> n/m
[06:44:58] <Bheam> yo
[06:45:13] <Bheam> how soon after i obj.val() can i calculate the new .width() of the obj? i'm getting wrong values
[06:47:42] <Bheam> nm i got it.. it was wrapping
[06:48:28] <ctx> hey guys, quick question - using a $.getJSON('url-to-api') call, its connecting to the api, but throwing this error in console - "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : " what is causing this?
[06:49:06] <ctx> eg: $.getJSON('http://api&callback=?', function(data) {
[06:49:07] <ctx>   console.log(data);
[06:49:47] <ajpiano> ctx:  is that API returning JSONP or just regular json
[06:49:59] <ctx> reg JSON
[06:50:35] <ajpiano> then you can't request it using JSONP
[06:50:39] <ajpiano> :p
[06:50:47] <ajpiano> it won't just magically work, the server has to return it in the proper format
[06:50:55] <ctx> how do you know its jsonp? :)
[06:52:10] <ajpiano> because making a request to another domain and putting the callback parm implies you want to be requesting jsonp
[06:52:42] <ajpiano> ctx: is this API on another domain?
[06:52:49] <ctx> yes it is.
[06:53:09] <ajpiano> then you have to hope it supports jsonp , or come up with a differen workaround
[06:53:13] <ajpiano> ?sop workaround
[06:53:13] <bot-t> workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[06:53:26] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: Check out profiler screenshot http://cl.ly/image/3L3z0d0n1R2C  I think the problem is in animate method?
[06:53:49] <ctx> ah makes sense..
[06:54:02] <ajpiano> it's only a problem if something is actually showing
[06:54:16] <ajpiano> do you have some kind of view that is automatically animated into state when it's created?
[06:54:25] <ajpiano> and are a lot of them happening simultaneously?
[06:54:31] <ajpiano> it's only a problem if something is actually slowing down*
[06:54:54] <ctx> ajpiano: thanks again.
[06:55:00] <ajpiano> welx
[06:55:43] <MoTiOnXml> does jQuery translate int values to "px" when using e.g. css("left", 10); ?
[06:55:50] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: it is. I have 143 views being animated
[06:55:55] <MoTiOnXml> or is a suffixed unit required?
[06:56:07] <ajpiano> i think it just assumes px if you pass an int, double check to be sure :p
[06:56:15] <Woet> not required, MoTiOnXml
[06:56:20] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: now, as you type that out, does that sound like a good idea :p
[06:56:22] <MoTiOnXml> so just ints? :)
[06:56:27] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: ok so now I see the problem. Will ask guys from #chaplinjs then :-) Thank you!
[06:56:33] <ajpiano> hehe :)
[06:56:57] <MoTiOnXml> i was wondering because it seemed like a nice thing to be able to pass the .offset() result to e.g. css()
[06:57:08] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: Chaplin's CollectionView does animation automatically. It seems it is impossible to turn off animation.
[06:58:16] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: interesting........ the insertView takes a disableAnimation param
[06:58:33] <ajpiano> but renderAllItems always passes false
[06:59:10] <masentinel900> Hello everybody
[06:59:12] <masentinel900> !!
[06:59:28] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: so why it does animation?
[06:59:29] <masentinel900> I have a problem with my script
[07:00:04] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: because they explicitly pass "false" meaning don't disable it :p
[07:00:18] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: -)
[07:00:33] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/AuYT6/
[07:00:42] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: having never heard of chaplin before, it seems like they have coded for the possibility of not wanting to animate, but there are no codepaths to not actually having animation
[07:00:44] <masentinel900> Always pass the same value!!
[07:01:12] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: it seems like passing an animationDuration of 0 disables the animation
[07:01:16] <ajpiano> when you instantiate the CollectionView
[07:01:20] <ajpiano> https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin/blob/master/docs/chaplin.collection_view.md
[07:01:30] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: yep, but it does not
[07:01:54] <ajpiano> then it sounds like #chaplinjs is definitely the right next destination
[07:02:40] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: may be passing animationDuration = 0 only calls .animate('fadeIn', 0). But anyways .animate method is being called, that where performance issues lie.
[07:03:13] <toxz> hey! how can i get an element which is not the very next but two elements after an element? .next() is not working here :-(
[07:03:34] <toxz> .next('xyz')
[07:03:43] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: Thanks for helping. Chaplin is a great subframework for Backbone. Check it out :-)
[07:03:57] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: seems like it just https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin/blob/master/src/chaplin/views/collection_view.coffee#L362
[07:04:05] <ajpiano> does opacity, not an 0 duration fade
[07:04:44] <ajpiano> ohh but elsewhere
[07:04:53] <ajpiano> https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin/blob/master/src/chaplin/views/collection_view.coffee#L405
[07:04:57] <ajpiano> yea that is Bad‚Ñ¢
[07:05:27] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I'll comment out this lien and check again
[07:05:53] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: just change it to $viewEl.show()
[07:07:06] <jeredepp> hi everyone, do you know how i can "reset" a droppable zone in jQuery UI?
[07:08:48] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: $viewEl.show() didn't work as it leaves items transparent BUT $viewEl.css('opacity',1) does. The performance increased and now it is two times faster! )
[07:09:33] <ajpiano> ah, show wouldn't work cause they're mucking with the opacity elsewhere
[07:09:47] <ajpiano> but there are a bunch of ways, obviously, to avoid getting inside of animate
[07:09:54] <ajpiano> which is what they *should* be doing if they get a 0
[07:10:04] <dhardison> hello, i've attached a listener to the document within a button click and it triggers both events. ideally, i'd like to the user makes a second click to trigger the document click.  as in, first click activates it, second click on the document would activate the second popup.  any simple ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/yamahabrez/zdYPm/
[07:10:29] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I personally use CSS3 for animation
[07:10:37] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: they have an option for that :p
[07:11:25] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: yes, but the performance is still suck when the useCssAnimation = true
[07:11:33] <ajpiano> uch
[07:11:36] <ajpiano> i mean let's be real
[07:11:39] <gx> hey guys, i'm looking for someone to take on a little side project, debugging some IE8 errors i'm having with jquery datatables. Feel free to PM me with experience/rates. Thanks!
[07:11:50] <ajpiano> doing fx in css or js to 150 elements simultaneously
[07:12:06] <ajpiano> not exactly a great idea for a web app :p
[07:12:21] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I actually don't need an animation for these 150 elements at all
[07:12:33] <ajpiano> ah
[07:12:44] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I'm looking for a way to completely disable that animation
[07:12:46] <ajpiano> yeah, it seems like the framework is a little inflexible about it right now
[07:12:52] <ajpiano> disabling ^^
[07:12:54] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/AuYT6/
[07:13:06] <masentinel900> is there some wrong here?
[07:13:17] <ajpiano> vlad_starkov: you can always create your own collectionview warpper :p
[07:15:51] <BillCriswell> Is there a good reason for a "platform" to now allow asynchronous requests? This script only works when I set async to false and I'm kind of curious as to why.
[07:22:27] <`RobW> BillCriswell: not usually a good idea as it locks up browsers
[07:23:00] <vlad_starkov> ajpiano: I was glad to talk with you. You're quite competent on jQuery. Good luck!
[07:23:13] <BillCriswell> `RobW: I'm aware. =( I don't have control over the server though. This is the only way around it.
[07:23:26] <BillCriswell> I'm just wondering from a technical standpoint why it wouldn't work.
[07:23:27] <ajpiano> welcome, vlad_starkov :) best of luck
[07:23:34] <`RobW> BillCriswell: debug it and see
[07:23:59] <`RobW> (check xhr.status, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4727950/debugging-jquery-ajax-function)
[07:24:17] <`RobW> masentinel900: more info pls
[07:24:18] <BillCriswell> When I try running it on a bunch of forms it just submits one.
[07:24:29] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:24:32] <`RobW> BillCriswell: can you jsfiddle an example?
[07:25:15] <masentinel900> <`RobW>: Thanks, see that script get the value of a radio input... the problem is always bringing the same data
[07:25:23] <octatone> Hey guys, I'm finding some weird behavior between 1.9 and 1.8.3, specifically with manipulating detached nodes.
[07:25:34] <octatone> http://jsfiddle.net/octatone/cAmD5/ http://jsfiddle.net/octatone/dMYeB/
[07:25:38] <masentinel900> If three are 10 options with diferents values always bring tha same
[07:26:03] <octatone> Same code, one is 1.8.3 and one with 1.9.0, the 1.8.3 result is the expected behavior
[07:26:17] <`RobW> masentinel900: what is "in-val-fun" - a radio or checkbox?
[07:26:37] <`RobW> also try $("input[name='in-val-fun']").is(":checked")
[07:27:08] <`RobW> and may as well wrap your IF() in braces
[07:27:11] <masentinel900> radio
[07:28:44] <BillCriswell> `RobW: http://clay2.mybigcommerce.com/amaco-artists-choice-glazes/ There's a "buy in bulk and save" section. Script starts at "942". It works with async: false, but when async: true it only seems to process one form.
[07:29:01] <BillCriswell> If you want me to switch it to async let me know.
[07:29:39] <juria_roberts> I have a checkbox <input type="checkbox" onchange="abc()" class="check" /> now when I check or uncheck the checkbox abc() is fired but $(".check").change(function(){}); isnt.why?
[07:30:12] <BillCriswell> juria_roberts: You'd have to do $('.check').trigger('change')
[07:31:09] <juria_roberts> BillCriswell: but if i remove onchange $(".check").change(function(){}); is fired
[07:31:21] <`RobW> BillCriswell: https://forum.bigcommerce.com/f4/simultaneously-adding-multiple-items-to-the-cart-1139/
[07:31:53] <`RobW> apparently it's a known problem.. seems like the ecommerce issue and not js
[07:32:03] <`RobW> they are also using a couple other url parameters you might want to look into
[07:32:11] <BillCriswell> `RobW: I know that haha. I was asking why it might not allow async requests.
[07:32:22] <BillCriswell> It wasn't really a JS question I guess. :(
[07:32:30] <`RobW> BillCriswell: no idea, try switching it to async.. I'll take a guess
[07:32:40] <NoiseEee> juria_roberts: thats why you don't use inline JS
[07:33:17] <`RobW> juria_roberts: also depends where you are binding that function..
[07:33:32] <`RobW> juria_roberts: try $(".check").on("change", fucntion() {});
[07:33:43] <BillCriswell> `RobW: It's not async.
[07:33:45] <BillCriswell> now*
[07:34:12] <juria_roberts> IS there a way i can fire both?
[07:34:14] <`RobW> BillCriswell:  it worked for me
[07:34:22] <`RobW> juria_roberts: it will fire both
[07:34:26] <NoiseEee> juria_roberts: by not using inline JS
[07:34:44] <BillCriswell> `RobW: Hmm...
[07:34:54] <NoiseEee> juria_roberts: take it out of the element and add the observer properly as in `RobW's example
[07:35:05] <`RobW> BillCriswell: oh nevermind it didn't do all of them
[07:35:11] <`RobW> BillCriswell: my best guess is this...
[07:35:18] <BillCriswell> `RobW: I was going to be sad if it worked for you and not me haha.
[07:35:44] <`RobW> BillCriswell: try returning FALSE (or e.preventDefault()) on the form submission and wait for the asyncs to complete (possibly count all boxes where count > 0, then compare with completed requests)
[07:36:01] <`RobW> the problem is after the first submission, your form is getting redirected, not allowing time for the others to complete
[07:36:54] <`RobW> BillCriswell: Unless there's a different way you can pass parameters in the url (multiple products in one post)
[07:36:59] <juria_roberts> NoiseEee: if i add an change event on name and change event on class will it fire both?
[07:37:15] <BillCriswell> `RobW: I think that approach might be a bit safer... that or he'll have to deal with the lockup lol.
[07:37:57] <masentinel900> <`RobW>: I already changed what you suggest me, But continues =
[07:38:01] <`RobW> nobody wants to deal with a lockup, you'll get complaints on slower systems
[07:38:18] <`RobW> BillCriswell: try making all those fields one form by itself, then post. it's using array keys
[07:38:49] <BillCriswell> `RobW: Im not sure how it'd associate the qty with whatever sku.
[07:38:52] <b-ot> associatetheqtywithwhateversku.com - ‚ò∫ AVAILABLE
[07:39:01] <BillCriswell> What... lol
[07:39:05] <`RobW> BillCriswell: true, nevermind that last part.. you may be stuck with a sync post :|
[07:39:14] <NoiseEee> juria_roberts: i'm saying remove onchange="abc()" from the tag.  you can then reduce your observer to: el.on('change',function(ev) { abc(); somethingElse(); //whatever } );
[07:40:18] <BillCriswell> A loading message might be a good medium ground.
[07:40:37] <BillCriswell> s/medium/middle?
[07:40:46] <BillCriswell> Guess either works.
[07:40:50] <`RobW> BillCriswell: you might want to add a couple hidden fields for each form... fastcart=1 and ajaxsubmit=1
[07:41:07] <BillCriswell> `RobW: To invoke some hidden magic?
[07:42:21] <`RobW> BillCriswell: nevermind, doesn't work anymore
[07:42:30] <masentinel900> <`RobW>: Do you have what would be the mistake?

[07:49:49] <`RobW> baldaris: there's example in the docs
[07:51:32] <kantlivelong> hey all im trying to use the following example http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html    ive got it working but the top and bottom of the arrow button dont seem to show.. unsure why
[07:52:47] <matsebc> Hey guys, got a question, what's the proper way to make a director's GL view transparent?
[07:55:12] <jnui> looking for help with selector context within an .each loop , for some reason the context is not limiting the selector (i think) , jsfiddle link = http://jsfiddle.net/Tjj64/
[07:55:15] <baldaris> 'rob: can you point me the url for example ?? http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/datepicker/ i am at this page
[07:55:20] <jnui> any help appr
[07:56:05] <matsebc> ops, wrong channel
[07:56:13] <`RobW> whoa, they changed jqueryui page
[07:56:16] <gnarf> jnui: the insertAfter doesn't take a context like that
[07:56:27] <gnarf> jnui: you will have to insertAfter( $("a....",this) )
[07:56:41] <`RobW> baldaris: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/datepicker/min-max.html
[07:57:05] <gnarf> jnui: er insertBefore, but yeah, same advice
[07:57:07] <`RobW> baldaris: use minDate/maxDate properties.. they can accept Date() object if I recall correctly
[07:57:29] <baldaris> robw:checking
[07:57:57] <gnarf> `RobW: been sleepin? we put up the new jqueryui page with 1.9 ;)
[07:58:20] <baldaris> rob: in the example - i am able to select previous dates - ie today is jan 16th i dont want user to be able to select dates like 15th jan 2013 and so
[07:58:41] <baldaris> what modifications do i need to do ?
[07:59:43] <`RobW> gnarf:  yea :|
[08:00:00] <jnui> ahh ok thanks gnarf
[08:00:05] <gnarf> baldaris: minDate: new Date()
[08:00:07] <`RobW> baldaris: then you set minDate to new date
[08:00:11] <`RobW> RAWR
[08:00:19] <gnarf> jnui: no problem :)
[08:05:11] <B3Jesus> Hey, is there any sort of bug with .css() returning px values when all of the css is in %?
[08:05:23] <B3Jesus> Can't seem to find any mention of that anywhere...
[08:07:13] <NoiseEee> B3Jesus: im pretty sure all your JS inquiries into css will yield pixel results
[08:07:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/M7Veh/ <-- whats wrong in that one try to add &nbsp; whit jQuery
[08:08:14] <`RobW> B3Jesus: NoiseEee is correct. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery for a potential workaround
[08:08:44] <B3Jesus> Hmm, well any idea why doing something along the lines of .animate({width: '70%'}) is using pixel values also?
[08:08:54] <B3Jesus> it's being set as 70px in the markup
[08:09:16] <tanitum> anyone know of a way to match multiple phrases within a regex
[08:09:34] <tanitum> for example (match this | or this)
[08:09:36] <`RobW> Whiskey: why are you using regex on html?
[08:09:39] <`RobW> can you not use a selector?
[08:09:46] <B3Jesus> I'm just trying to toggle an element between a width of 70% and 100% but it's setting it to 70px and 100px respectively
[08:09:53] <`RobW> tanitum: /(phrase1|phrase2|asdf)/
[08:09:59] <B3Jesus> which is really grinding my gears
[08:09:59] <`RobW> ?
[08:10:10] <tanitum> the spaces seem to throw it off
[08:10:14] <`RobW> B3Jesus: use css classes and toggle them
[08:10:45] <B3Jesus> But then I'd lose the width change animation, wouldn't I?
[08:10:54] <Whiskey> cuz i wanne find the text inside the span
[08:10:55] <baldaris> rob: thanks i got it!
[08:11:02] <baldaris> appreciate the help
[08:11:08] <tanitum> thank you for the response RobW
[08:11:21] <Whiskey> ^^
[08:11:37] <B3Jesus> ahh, hang on, jquery ui extends the animate function...
[08:11:47] <B3Jesus> i'll have a look there
[08:12:05] <Whiskey> `RobW <span class="infoViewLineLeft">Test 1:</span> to <span class="infoViewLineLeft">Test 1:&nbsp;</span>
[08:12:35] <Whiskey> Im going to do this whit more lines, but i only test whit one line, so thats why i use the regexp to know what text o have in the replaced one whit &nbsp;
[08:12:57] <B3Jesus> Thanks for your help `RobW, think i'm on the right track now
[08:13:59] <Fenikkusu> Can someone please review this and tell me how it looks structurally and what changes I should make from a jQuery Design Pattern perspective? http://jsfiddle.net/8dgpq/2/
[08:14:38] <`RobW> Whiskey: use selectors and select the div instead.. ?
[08:15:25] <`RobW> Fenikkusu: why are you using tThis versus just using "this" ?
[08:15:40] <Whiskey> RobW not sure how to do that :/
[08:15:48] <Whiskey> not so good on jQuery
[08:16:08] <Fenikkusu> RobW, Scope Protection.
[08:16:22] <`RobW> Whiskey: $(".infoViewLineLeft").append("&nbsp;")
[08:16:46] <Fenikkusu> Though granted it's probably not needed in this instance.
[08:17:03] <`RobW> you can still change this through tThis though
[08:17:05] <Whiskey> tats not work on fiddle RobW

[08:31:15] <cambazz> is there a jquery plugin for that
[08:31:48] <masentinel900> <`RobW>: definitely dont works..
[08:32:01] <masentinel900> I already seen the post jquery page
[08:32:11] <masentinel900> And I found not an error
[08:38:38] <cambazz> well, i think i need an infinite scroll plugin
[08:39:09] <`RobW> and lazy loading
[08:41:08] <CIDIC> anyone familiar with jquery mobile?
[08:41:23] <`RobW> meh
[08:42:24] <CIDIC> I can't change a navbar once it is created, it acts strange if you try to change or replace it ><
[08:43:23] <`RobW> i've had issues with jquery mobile like that too.. maybe someone else can help heh
[08:45:11] <jklaus> hey .. is there a way to make a popover appear if a select has a particular option selected?
[08:47:14] <BillCriswell> Is jsonp the safest bet for getting data across domains?
[08:49:25] <`RobW> BillCriswell: $.getJSON calls jsonp if external i believe
[08:49:28] <thang> jklaus: sure, use change() on the option you want to observe to register the event, then show the popover in the handler if its selected
[08:49:45] <BillCriswell> `RobW: I tried CORS but IE seems to not dig it.
[08:49:52] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: What exactly do you want to change about it?
[08:50:11] <CIDIC> I just want to swap out a button
[08:50:31] <CIDIC> if user is logged in, the login button is replaced with a my profile button
[08:50:38] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Then why are you destroying the whole header?
[08:50:44] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Just destroy the button.
[08:50:49] <BillCriswell> XDR... Pffff.
[08:50:56] <CIDIC> I thought you couldn't add them dynamically
[08:51:11] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Have you tried?
[08:51:15] <`RobW> BillCriswell: don't you need to set Access-Control-Allow-Headers
[08:51:27] <Fenikkusu> So no more input on this then? http://jsfiddle.net/8dgpq/2/
[08:51:38] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: I've tried so many thigns I can't remember let me try agian real quick
[08:51:59] <BillCriswell> `RobW: Yeah, I have that set. IE doesn't appear to listen.
[08:52:08] <`RobW> stupid ie
[08:52:12] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Make a demo: http://jsbin/com/amozef/edit
[08:52:28] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Then we can try together.
[08:52:47] <`RobW> BillCriswell: without really knowing what you're doing, maybe you can look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4613310/how-to-call-external-url-in-jquery for an example
[08:53:07] <`RobW> (try $.ajax)
[08:59:03] <bigtunacan> I'm trying to use a selector based on the text from it's label, but can't quite figure it out
[09:00:53] <`RobW> $("label:contains('some text')")
[09:01:41] <`RobW> bigtunacan: also, you can get more advanced (such as using regex): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/813477/jquery-selector-where-text-some-value
[09:03:20] <bigtunacan> @RobW, thanks.  I googled and looked at stack overflow, but wasn't using the right search terms apparently.
[09:03:28] <bigtunacan> That was what I needed

[09:04:52] <`RobW> ...
[09:05:21] <hugo_moss> hi, i have two div boxes. each of them have an animating menu (nested li-ul). on each menu, there is an event handler attached with the li selector.  both div boxes have exactly the same menu.  each div box detaches and reattaches handlers for other buttons. the problem is both div boxes detach and reattach the same handlers.  so if i click on one div box, and that div box is in the middle of
[09:05:21] <hugo_moss> detaching and reattaching handlers, and then i quickly click the other div box, one of them is in the process of detaching and reattaching, and the other one does the same time. so the ordering gets messed up. i can wait for one to finish before the other one is done, but my problem is they both cant depend on each other to finish.
[09:05:25] <hugo_moss> what can i do?
[09:06:00] <`RobW> that almost sounds bad
[09:06:14] <`RobW> anyways, can you post an example?
[09:06:20] <hugo_moss> ok
[09:06:53] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: still there?
[09:11:40] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Still around ...
[09:11:57] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: here is my test case http://jsbin.com/amozef/63/edit
[09:13:29] <hugo_moss> `RobW: http://jsfiddle.net/L3xtM/
[09:15:07] <`RobW> hugo_moss: maybe you can look into the animation callbacks
[09:15:08] <hugo_moss> and the problem is they both have to be able to be clickable and workable, i cant wait for the other one to finish
[09:15:17] <`RobW> hm..
[09:15:59] <`RobW> i'm not quite sure without seeing the current implementation
[09:17:55] <hugo_moss> `RobW: is it ok if i privmsg you?
[09:17:56] <b-ot> hugo_moss, memorised ‚ÄúRobW:‚Äù.
[09:18:10] <`RobW> ok
[09:18:16] <`RobW> `robw
[09:18:25] <`RobW> `RobW: test
[09:18:38] <`RobW> why did the b-ot memorize me
[09:19:49] <BillCriswell> That thing does some interesting stuff.
[09:23:01] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: any ideas about that navbar?
[09:23:39] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: I'm looking at it.
[09:23:53] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: thank you, I'm quite stuck
[09:24:04] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC:  I'm thinking that you might want to put an invisible placeholder between the third and fourth button.
[09:24:14] <zoned> $parentl.find(".someClass").remove();    will remove all elements with class of "someClass" inside of $parent, right? if the next line of code that executes REQUIRES all "someClass" elements to be removed, do i need to utilize a callback? does .remove() have one? (can't seem to find anything)
[09:24:24] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: And then place the new button after the placeholder after you've removed the fourth button.
[09:24:41] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: The thing is, the toolbar, being persistent, is getting replicated on all pages.
[09:25:08] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: can have have all the buttons I'm going to use in there and just hide/show the ones I want?
[09:25:11] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: That may actually be a bug, because IIRC the toolbar is supposed to be moved from one page to another, not copied.
[09:25:15] <systemfault> zoned: .remove() is sync... not sure what you mean.
[09:25:25] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Excellent idea!
[09:25:38] <systemfault> zoned: The line after will be executer once the elements are removed.
[09:25:42] <systemfault> *executed
[09:25:42] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: how do I trick it into rendering for only 4 buttons instead of 5?
[09:26:01] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: ... except for that one snag :)
[09:26:12] <zoned> systemfault: ok, that makes sense why there's no callback then! (i guess my problem must be something else) thanks
[09:26:13] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: ?
[09:27:13] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Hmmm ... not too sure, actually, because the rendered version uses the block layout classes ... can't have too many buttons in there.
[09:28:23] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: this is a simple and common enough task why is it so difficult?
[09:29:10] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: That's a fair question.
[09:29:31] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: this whole navbar thing seems to be designed to never change once it is created
[09:29:45] <CIDIC> which is why I was trying to scrap the whole thing and re build it
[09:29:49] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: You could repurpose the existing button.
[09:29:50] <CIDIC> to change the button
[09:29:57] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Just change its label.
[09:30:04] <CIDIC> and href?
[09:30:10] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Yeah.
[09:31:31] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Actually, that's probably simplest. If the look of the UI need not change, then there's no need to unduly whack about its structure - like adding/removing buttons, etc.
[09:32:03] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: unless special data / events are bound to the buttons when they are enhanced by the navbar widget :-/
[09:32:50] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: is there a way to check if that is the case?
[09:33:37] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: You can minimize the number of things bound to the button if you use .one(). Then, the event will only be handled once - presumably when it's needed.
[09:34:03] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: how can that help me?
[09:34:18] <CIDIC> I meant jquery mobile binding special events or data, not me
[09:34:38] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Oh, I don't think you need to worry about that.
[09:35:20] <CIDIC> |
[09:35:31] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: doing anything dynamic in jqmobile seems like a huge deal :(
[09:35:38] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: I agree.
[09:35:53] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: It's one of our major focus issues for 1.4.0 ...
[09:36:09] <CIDIC> sencha touch seems to be a much better development platform but seems to be inferior to jquery mobile style / browser compatibility
[09:37:03] <philhutchinson> Is there a way I can use $("#element").height("100px"); with display: block; ?
[09:37:12] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: are you on the 'team' or whatever it is now?
[09:37:37] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Yes.
[09:38:13] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: I've done quite a few apps in jqmobile and might have some useful input if you are interested but I assume it has all been said before. maybe I'm wrong?
[09:38:16] <zoned> is there a way i can programmatically reset the horizontal scrollbar to 0?
[09:38:30] <zoned> aka, scroll all the way left
[09:38:36] <matteu> philhutchinson:  If you're meaning 'can I change the display option of an element with a direct' function, no, but $('#element').css( 'display', block');  should do the trick.
[09:39:14] <philhutchinson> no i mean, can I resize an element that has display: block; set for it?
[09:39:40] <matteu> philhutchinson:  I don't immediately see why not, do you have a fiddle?
[09:39:43] <philhutchinson> Basically I'm using a wizard, and its got display: block set for it, and none of the .height(); .css("height", "100px"); etc will work
[09:39:57] <matteu> zoned: see http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[09:40:21] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: If you can break it down into specific issues, then the issue tracker is the best place for your input. We've added a few people to our team, and they're especially good at triaging issues, so you'd probably be able to help us out a lot that way.
[09:40:27] <matteu> philhutchinson: Hold on a second.
[09:40:30] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/amozef/74/edit getting closer
[09:40:57] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Nice!
[09:41:02] <_|Nix|_> Only the styling is off ...
[09:41:08] <zoned> matteu: i was looking at that, but i don't always know the left most element‚Ä¶ can i just do it on body?
[09:41:27] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: yea
[09:41:50] <matteu> zoned:  probably $(document).scrollLeft(0);
[09:42:06] <CIDIC> well I mean obviously the navbar is damn near impossible to use for anything dynamic.
[09:42:08] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: You'll want $( this ).find() not $page.find() ...
[09:42:09] <zoned> ahh, yeah that's a better idea. thanks
[09:42:54] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: ... or $pages ...
[09:43:43] <philhutchinson> matteu: ok
[09:43:58] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: opps, but that didn't fix it ><
[09:44:12] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: D00d! The theme changes ...
[09:44:28] <CIDIC> ?
[09:44:38] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: ... when you go back to beta or gamma ...
[09:45:07] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: ? I am not seeing that
[09:45:21] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Maybe I had something stale going on ...
[09:45:54] <CIDIC> is navbar('refresh') a thing?
[09:46:00] <CIDIC> is that from an old version?
[09:46:09] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Start -> Login -> Login -> Alpha -> Beta
[09:46:28] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: The one where I corrected $page for $pages
[09:46:36] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: http://jsbin.com/amozef/75
[09:46:44] <CIDIC> I am on http://jsbin.com/amozef/74/edit
[09:46:55] <philhutchinson> Anyone any ideas how I can dynamically resize a div, if its got display: block set? it currently doesnt resize, and ive no idea why -.-
[09:47:13] <CIDIC> you dont' want it to do it for all pages just ones that have been 'enhanced' already
[09:47:18] <philhutchinson> I can resize it by hard coding <div style="height: 600px;"> into the page but cant manipulate it after that
[09:47:31] <matteu> philhutchison: This works. http://jsfiddle.net/N9XRs/
[09:47:32] <CIDIC> the ones that have NOT been enhanced will render the buttons corectly when they are first navigated to.
[09:47:55] <`RobW> philhutchinson: post your code.. you're doing something wrong
[09:48:00] <matteu> philhutchison:  So I don't think the issue is that block items can't be resized using .height.  Something else is going on.
[09:48:04] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: so it should be like this http://jsbin.com/amozef/77/edit
[09:48:22] <`RobW> matteu: delay won't work in your case (height is not an animation)
[09:48:42] <`RobW> matteu: http://jsfiddle.net/N9XRs/2/ would work
[09:48:44] <`RobW> just an fyi :D
[09:48:46] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: if you do start -> login -> loginBTN -> beta it is rendered correctly
[09:49:05] <CIDIC> bc that page hadn't been 'enhanced' yet
[09:49:06] <matteu> RobW: Thanks.  That was silly of me.  It still demonstrates the point, luckilly.
[09:49:09] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: What about start -> login -> loginBTN -> alpha -> beta?
[09:49:47] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: in that case alpha has already been 'enhanced' bc it was the starting page
[09:49:54] <CIDIC> so it is wrong
[09:50:03] <philhutchinson> matteu: just tried that example, and nah it didnt work either :(
[09:50:12] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: It works with 77 ... I'm not seeing the themeing issue after that sequence.
[09:50:18] <CIDIC> the issue is you need to give jqm a specific markup when you first load that page
[09:50:26] <CIDIC> the theme is the same I am seeing a height issue
[09:50:28] <jschwartz> hello, how do I make it so I can click a link several times in a row?
[09:50:30] <CIDIC> in the changed button
[09:50:57] <matteu> philhutchinson:  What browser are you using?  I'm looking at the fiddle right now and it's resizing the div to 100px as expected.
[09:51:14] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: I'm seeing that too, but I'm also discovering other issues.
[09:51:14] <CIDIC> What about start -> login -> loginBTN -> alpha  the my-profile button seems to have not top/bottom padding?
[09:51:25] <philhutchinson> oh, no sorry the example works, in jsfiddle, but i copied your code into another event im using on my site and it didnt work
[09:51:30] <philhutchinson> I'm using FF 18, or whatever the latest is
[09:51:37] <philhutchinson> 18.0
[09:51:41] <philhutchinson> On OS X
[09:51:47] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: what are the other issues?
[09:51:50] <vlad_starkov> Question about JScrollPane plugin: does anyone know how to set explicitly number of pixels that are will be scrolled by on scroll event?
[09:51:50] <philhutchinson> inb4 "thats what the problem is"
[09:51:54] <matteu> philhutchinson:  Ah.  Again, something else is going on, and speculating on that is could take all day without some code to look at. :)
[09:52:17] <philhutchinson> ;p
[09:52:19] <philhutchinson> hmm
[09:52:29] <philhutchinson> I'll show you the event it's firing on
[09:52:41] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Well, for example Start -> Login -> LoginBTN -> Alpha -> Beta <- Back
[09:52:48] <star_prone> hi
[09:52:52] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: You should be at Alpha, but you're seeing the login button.
[09:53:26] <matteu> philhutchinson:  Are you absolutely sure that the .height call is being reached/performed?
[09:53:38] <star_prone> is there any limitation in selecting tags that have the id ended in numbers?
[09:53:45] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: fixed another bug http://jsbin.com/amozef/78/edit
[09:53:50] <star_prone> like, for example, procent1
[09:53:55] <CIDIC> need to change the inner text not the a tag
[09:54:18] <CIDIC> so that fixes the padding issue
[09:54:56] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Yeah. You should do this: <a><span id="putTextHere">Login</span></a> and then $( "#putTextHere" ).text( "My Profile" );
[09:55:02] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: ugh, that back button bug looks like that event / data atachment stuff I was worried about ><
[09:55:54] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: isn't that what I did?
[09:56:52] <`RobW> star_prone: nope it'll work
[09:57:02] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Not in /77 ...
[09:57:17] <CIDIC>     $btnLogin.find('.ui-btn-inner').empty().append('My Profile');
[09:57:18] <CIDIC> ?
[09:58:23] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: As a matter of principle, you shouldn't rely on .ui-btn-inner ...
[09:58:31] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: ok
[09:58:50] <philhutchinson> matteu: http://jsfiddle.net/MtUWn/
[09:58:56] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: In later versions of jQM we may decide to change the inner structure of a button so that an element with that class is no longer there.
[09:58:59] <matteu> CIDIC, _|Nix|_: Oh jeez, playing with the Jquery Mobile generated stuff. blargh
[09:58:59] <CIDIC> ugh also I can't figure out how to get it to redirect to a different page after you click the login button it seems to go crazy if you do $.mobile.changePage('#alpha'); at the end of the button click function
[09:59:02] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Then your code will break.
[09:59:50] <CIDIC> but that button inner code is generated by jqm so?
[10:00:16] <matteu> philhutchinson: Just a second.
[10:00:23] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: I believe the navigation issue with the last sequence is actually a bug in the navigation, which we've overhauled since 1.2.0 - and you're using master in /78
[10:00:33] <philhutchinson> matteu: when I use the .height() call to set it, then use .height() to get the height value, it says its set correctly at 100px
[10:00:45] <philhutchinson> but it doesnt change in the browser
[10:01:18] <therealklanni> I don't see a download for jquery.min.map on the site for 1.9, can anyone point me in the right direction?
[10:01:29] <matteu> philhutchinson:  So you are using a browser js interaction firebug like thing for Safari to probe the height of the element after page render?
[10:02:54] <philhutchinson> im alerting "setting height", then calling .height("100px"), then alerting $("#element").height() + " <- height";
[10:03:21] <philhutchinson> and the last alert shows 100, as expected, but nothing happens on the page
[10:03:50] <matteu> philhutchinson:  Well, a) your fiddle is using width and b) it's working correctly, so that wasn't much help.
[10:04:08] <matteu> There should be no difference between an event fired from a button over any other.
[10:04:34] * philhutchinson sighs
[10:04:38] <philhutchinson> ill show you my css, maybe thats the issue
[10:04:57] <star_prone> `RobW: then why it isn't working for me
[10:05:09] <matteu> philhutchinson: It could be that your DOM and CSS are hiding the height expansion some how.
[10:05:15] <star_prone> it may be because I have a space at the end of the id value?
[10:05:30] <star_prone> id="procent-49 "
[10:05:34] <star_prone> ?
[10:05:40] <matteu> philhutchinson:  You could try using Firefox's DOM inspector or Firebug to look at a graphical representation of the element's height.
[10:05:44] <philhutchinson> matteu: http://pastie.org/5697885
[10:05:46] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/amozef/85/edit I think I got it working (mostly)
[10:05:57] <matteu> philhutchinson:  You could also check to see if there are CSS rules that are breaking the animation, like !important
[10:06:11] <therealklanni> Does anyone know where to get jquery.min.map?
[10:06:55] <matteu> Yeah, so I see some position: absolutes and overflow: hiddens
[10:07:01] <matteu> Those are culprits.
[10:07:58] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: here is what I really want http://jsbin.com/amozef/87/edit
[10:08:04] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: what do you think?
[10:08:21] <therealklanni> Found it here, for anyone else looking: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.map
[10:08:26] <`RobW> star_prone: ?
[10:08:43] <philhutchinson> matteu: is there a way to get round those?
[10:09:04] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Checking it out ...
[10:09:17] <`RobW> star_prone: you can't have a space in an id
[10:09:35] <matteu> philhutchinson:  Well, if a parent element has 'overflow: hidden' and a static height, it will hide anything that goes out of bounds.  I think you'll have to change some of your CSS and DOM, and that's about all you can do.
[10:09:49] <matteu> If that's the issue.
[10:09:55] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Very nice!
[10:10:07] <matteu> The first step is always just removing those attributes and seeing if that fixes the problem acceptable.
[10:10:12] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: that history issue is still there, but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with my code :(
[10:10:32] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: going to try a logout button to reverse it and see if that breaks it :(((
[10:12:04] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: That history issue is a problem with the library.
[10:12:41] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: I've actually got a pretty ugly jqm project going using jqm router and backbone
[10:13:15] <philhutchinson> matteu: even if .height() is called?
[10:13:52] <zoned> how could i position an element in the exact middle of the screen, regardless of how the user stretches/resizes or scrolls in their window?
[10:14:03] <matteu> philhutchinson: Yes.
[10:14:19] <philhutchinson> so nothing to do with display: block; ?
[10:15:04] <matteu> philhutchinson:  display CSS properties shouldn't ever prevent height changes
[10:16:03] <matteu> philhutchinson: unless it's display: none
[10:16:13] <thang> zoned: something like that should be done with CSS, and depends on whats on the page already
[10:16:25] <thang> regardless, let me get something up for you
[10:17:02] <zoned> thang: i've got a lot of dynamic content, so if the user scrolls horizontally like 75% of the way, css positions the element too far left, i still want this thing to display in the middle
[10:19:56] <thang> zoned: can you get an example page of this specific instance up?
[10:20:20] <philhutchinson> matteu: so using overflow: visible; should help?
[10:21:34] <thang> zoned: well, rather if the css doesnt seem out of line and you still want to do this programmatically with jquery this might help you out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210717/using-jquery-to-center-a-div-on-the-screen
[10:22:32] <zoned> thang: the problem is with css, it won't follow you if you scroll
[10:27:23] <thang> zoned: sounds like you should put the centered content inside an absolute positioned div, without looking at the code
[10:28:44] <zoned> thang: i guess maybe i misspoke.. i don't want it centered on the page. i wanted it centered for the viewer, wherever they happen to be looking on the page
[10:29:07] <zoned> because depending on where they've scrolled, absolutely centered on the page may be out of view
[10:30:09] <`RobW> zoned
[10:30:32] <`RobW> position: fixed; top: 50%; left: 50%; margin-left: -(width/2)px; margin-top: -(height/2)px;
[10:30:33] <`RobW> ?
[10:32:59] <zoned> `RobW: that's what i've got, but if you scroll horizontally, or expand the content horizontally, then scroll, it's not going to follow you
[10:33:57] <zoned> oh, fixed, not absolute
[10:34:29] <`RobW> fixed is not supported on many mobile devices so be aware.. it'll piss people off
[10:34:34] <`RobW> (or even you) lol
[10:34:47] <`RobW> best action is to bind window scrolling, then reposition the element
[10:34:55] <`RobW> unless you're not supporting mobile, then who cares.
[10:35:26] <star_prone> if I have a radio button selected
[10:35:34] <star_prone> how can I deselect it?
[10:35:38] <jedrek> time to test this thing in IE8
[10:35:45] <jedrek> into the breach gentelmen
[10:36:19] <thang> godspeed
[10:36:46] <jedrek> oh, ie's not working in this VM
[10:39:54] <BillCriswell> And once again the hard part is done and I am bored.
[10:40:39] <`RobW> star_prone: $("elem").removeAttr("checked")
[10:42:17] <BillCriswell> .prop('checked', false) might be a bit safer?
[10:46:06] <`RobW> BillCriswell: yes that too
[10:46:15] <`RobW> I think that's the new way of doing it I've heard..
[10:46:30] <tcstar> I'm having a little bit of an issue with some JS...  I tried adding it to jsfiddle -- and because of the context of the html and css it doesn't work properly....  here is the jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/5r7Gk/  for reference -- but easier if i create a user on the application for someone to see what it's doing (or not doing)
[10:46:31] <BillCriswell> I always mix up which I should be using until I look it up haha.
[10:47:13] <BillCriswell> The FANTASTIC MrFox?
[10:48:09] <`RobW> tcstar: what are you trying to accomplish
[10:49:03] <tcstar> Well, the div's are swapping places...  the first set of products are working fine, and the sub-categories are working fine too...  but the products in the sub-categories is returning an invalid number when i run .size()
[10:49:25] <tcstar> I can create a test admin for you, so you can see first hand what it's doing.
[10:51:31] <philhutchinson> matteu: if youre still here, thanks for the help sir
[10:51:48] <philhutchinson> it was some retarded jquery statement which auto resized the screen, but badly.
[10:53:27] <Eiam> at pointed out all these options
[10:53:28] <Eiam> set to expire jan 19th
[10:53:36] <Eiam> argh wrong room
[11:14:52] <joshmock> sup, #jquery! anyone ever had an issue like this with .toggle()? http://bpaste.net/show/wuOKhiohr0vDW9rTSPiX/
[11:15:43] <`RobW> joshmock: you're extending "selected" which is a bool
[11:15:54] <marthinal> I'm using jquery 1.3.2 jquery ui 1.7.3 and tabs only works on ff .not on safari or chrome ... any idea?
[11:16:06] <`RobW> wait, misread that
[11:16:10] <`RobW> what's selected = ?
[11:16:35] <joshmock> `RobW: selected is a Backbone view
[11:17:16] <`RobW> joshmock: guess we'd have to see more code to see what's going on
[11:17:44] <`RobW> and I don't know what you mean by backbone view
[11:18:39] <joshmock> `RobW: http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View
[11:19:27] <`RobW> joshmock: can you console.log(selected.$el) and see if that method exists? maybe it's not extending right? no idea.
[11:20:15] <`RobW> also, maybe check web console to see if those three toggles ar ethrowing any type of error
[11:20:18] <joshmock> `RobW: Chrome debugging says selected.$el is a standard jQuery element.
[11:20:33] <joshmock> no errors either
[11:21:01] <`RobW> joshmock: extend the selected.$el in console to see its properties and methods
[11:21:26] <`RobW> also, is selected.$el a jquery object with a collection of dom items?
[11:21:35] <`RobW> test via selected.$el.length I'd assume
[11:22:13] <joshmock> selected.$el.length is 1
[11:22:23] <joshmock> you're basically running thru a list of everything I've already tried :)
[11:22:54] <`RobW> just checking :)
[11:23:00] * `RobW is not a mind reader!
[11:25:53] <`RobW> joshmock: what about selected.el.hide() ?
[11:26:54] <joshmock> figured it out‚Ä¶ well, mostly. apparently the element is detached from the DOM :|
[11:27:04] <joshmock> even though I can see it
[11:27:11] <joshmock> whatever it's referring to is not there
[11:27:21] <`RobW> $el is for cached objects though maybe that's why?
[11:27:22] <joshmock> selected.$el.parent() returned []
[11:29:00] <husel> Hey, can anyone suggest why my loads aren't working? Thanks http://pastebin.com/XWaDX174
[11:29:09] <`RobW> joshmock: thats why i was suggesting el instead of $el
[11:29:40] <danheberden> husel, stuff like ` $("#page1").click(load("page1.html"));`
[11:29:43] <`RobW> husel: instead of $(document).ready(load("home.html")); -- try $(document).ready(function() { load("home.html") });
[11:29:43] <joshmock> `RobW: yep, that should fix me up, gonna back up and figure out why that element never got attached. thanks for your help :)
[11:29:48] <danheberden> is going to caust you problems
[11:29:56] <danheberden> *cause
[11:29:58] <`RobW> you need to wrap it in an anonymous funtion
[11:30:00] <`RobW> function
[11:30:07] <danheberden> i'll let `RobW answer
[11:30:34] <husel> ah i see, i'll give that a go. I made that function to try and hide the function(){ } stuff everywhere, hehe
[11:31:36] <`RobW> joshmock: toggle() is deprecated btw
[11:31:43] <husel> the ready() is working now, the click isn't
[11:32:28] <danheberden> husel: same problem
[11:32:31] <`RobW> husel: same principle as the .ready(). ..
[11:32:37] <danheberden> you're passing the result of load('whatever') into click()
[11:32:44] <danheberden> which is useless to click()
[11:32:54] <`RobW> ^
[11:32:55] <Whiskey> Is the background-color in opera fixed?
[11:33:04] <Whiskey> Cuz i have that problem now whit latest jQuery
[11:33:08] <husel> i've added the frunction(){ load..} part
[11:33:12] <joshmock> `RobW: current project is using 1.6.4 so not deprecated according to my ancient history :) but I didn't know that. thanks for the heads up
[11:33:24] <`RobW> rock on D:
[11:33:44] <`RobW> husel: you're binding .click before the element exists
[11:33:56] <`RobW> wrap all your js in $(function() { /* CODE HERE */ });
[11:34:09] <`RobW> or move it to before </body>
[11:35:31] <husel> `RobW:  it's working perfectly now :)
[11:35:34] <husel> thanks guys
[11:38:32] <joshmock> `RobW: oh wait, .toggle() for events is deprecated, not .toggle() that combines .show() and .hide(). deprecated because it's ambiguous to have two .toggle() functions that do completely different things. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[11:38:50] <joshmock> `RobW: see also http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11786
[11:39:48] <`RobW> aha!
[11:40:45] <`RobW> so they're going to the single toggle() function cool
[11:40:53] <joshmock> yep, seems that way.
[11:41:16] <joshmock> makes sense. i totally forgot you could do event toggling, which is actually kind of confusing, especially as a core feature
[11:53:45] <tomasm-> hi, can draggable use a containment to a container that isn't necessarily an ancestor of the draggable object? just to use the coordinates as restrictions i guess
[11:54:28] <zennit47> what using jquery ajax post
[11:54:43] <zennit47> the response renders json in my browser
[11:54:46] <zennit47> why is that?
[11:55:33] <`RobW> zennit47: what are your $.post parameters?
[11:57:37] <zennit47> its a form with $(this).serialize()
[11:57:50] <zennit47> for a login
[11:57:58] <zennit47> using node/express on server
[11:58:24] <zennit47> the login logic works and logs me in
[11:58:41] <zennit47> returns json
[11:59:16] <zennit47> but instead of showing success message renders the response json in the browser
[11:59:22] <gnarf> `RobW: joshmock: it's actually still 2 functions :)
[12:00:07] <tomasm-> zennit47, we need to see more code - pastebin it
[12:00:13] <gnarf> .toggle( true/false ) or .toggle( animation stuff )
[12:01:48] <zennit47> here's the client script
[12:01:49] <zennit47> http://pastebin.com/wD8Yba2X
[12:01:56] <andern> if $(this).siblings(".someselector") returns 6 siblings. is there an easy way to perform an action on only the first three?
[12:02:11] <`RobW> gnarf: yes, we were talking about in 1.8 it's deprec, 1.9 removed
[12:02:17] <`RobW> I wasn't sure why.. but now we know
[12:02:52] <zennit47> here server
[12:02:53] <zennit47> http://pastebin.com/AZNLc43q
[12:06:38] <tomasm-> zennit47, I dont recognize that syntax, where's all the punctuation?
[12:06:46] <tomasm-> for the client side
[12:07:00] <zennit47> its coffeescript
[12:07:49] <tomasm-> dunno, otherwise looks decent.... you should add some code into success() to make sure it gets triggered
[12:10:48] <grafi> too much recursion ._.
[12:11:36] <tomasm-> how can I tell whether a draggable is enabled or not? after i call draggable('disable') etc
[12:13:59] <thang> tomasm-: var isDisabled = $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "disabled" );
[12:15:22] <tomasm-> thang, thang-ks!
[12:17:50] <lresende> i have a ul emenet, <ul id="resource-list" data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true">‚Ä¶ how do I get the selected element on this ?
[12:17:57] <lresende> i have tried things like
[12:17:58] <lresende> $('#resource-list').on('click',  function() {
[12:17:59] <lresende>                 var selected = $(this).find(":selected").text();
[12:18:10] <lresende> but it can't seem to get the selected one
[12:18:25] <NoiseEee> lresende: how is a <li> selected?
[12:18:29] <tomasm-> lresende, UL's and LI's dont have selected pseudo elements - there may be a class on there though
[12:18:38] <tomasm-> they're not selectable
[12:18:48] <karbassi> lresende: ul's aren't selectable. You will want to use <select> and <option>
[12:19:19] <lresende> let me give a quick try
[12:19:28] <NoiseEee> give what a quick try?
[12:20:04] <hugo_moss> i have two events attached with .on, each event turns on/off navigation buttons. the problem is they both turn on/off the same navigation buttons. if one of the events are triggered immediately after the other starts executing, they criss-cross. so the same event might be attached more than once. the events should attach only once when both the events are triggered.
[12:20:41] <hugo_moss> and i cant have one wait for the other to finish completing, both need to execute when clicked.
[12:20:52] <hugo_moss> how can i approach this?
[12:22:08] <tomasm-> hugo_moss, chain them, ie one as a callback?
[12:23:41] <hugo_moss> what do you mean by chain them? i dont follow
[12:24:07] <lresende> NoiseEee: change ul to select
[12:28:55] <tomasm-> hugo_moss, i'd need to see code
[12:28:59] <hugo_moss> ok
[12:30:42] <der_On> hi. I'm creating complete html element-trees by passing html code to $(). but in 1.9 this gives me Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:
[12:31:31] <BillCriswell> der_On: Valid?
[12:31:33] <systemfault> der_On: Try with $.parseHTML
[12:31:48] <der_On> the code looks valid.
[12:31:53] <der_On> systemfault: okay
[12:32:14] <tidalwav1> Hi all, attempting to migrate to jQuery 1.9 here. Am I nuts or can jQuery no longer parse HTML strings with leading/trailing newlines?
[12:32:37] <systemfault> Same advice I gave der_On
[12:32:42] <systemfault> tidalwav1^
[12:32:52] <der_On> systemfault: thanks. that worked
[12:32:56] <tidalwav1> systemfault: just joined
[12:33:06] <systemfault> tidalwav1: Try with $.parseHTML
[12:33:49] <tidalwav1> Ahhh, now I see that section in the migration guide
[12:36:10] <tidalwav1> systemfault: parseHTML makes no difference
[12:36:29] <tidalwav1> still barfs on leading/trailing whitespace
[12:36:29] <tidalwav1> errr
[12:36:30] <tidalwav1> newlines
[12:37:33] <systemfault> Weird.. as is was created for that purpose :/
[12:37:47] <tidalwav1> $.parseHTML("
[12:37:49] <tidalwav1> <div />
[12:37:51] <tidalwav1> ");
[12:37:59] <tidalwav1> still throws Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:39:38] <tomasm-> tidalwav1, why not call $.trim(string) ?
[12:39:47] <systemfault> Not sure I get it.. it's invalid js what you're doing..
[12:40:11] <[jmc]> is this you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14367372/unexpected-token-illegal-from-multi-line-string-via-template-toolkit
[12:40:37] <systemfault> tidalwav1: You cannot split strings on multiple lines like that..
[12:40:38] <tidalwav1> systemfault: ahhhh that's true, no multiline strings
[12:40:42] <tidalwav1> tomasm-: using this for parsing templates
[12:40:56] <systemfault> tidalwav1: You could add backslashes at the end of each lines IIRC...
[12:41:01] <systemfault> Or use concatenation
[12:41:07] <tidalwav1> systemfault: yup, easy to forget when working with REPL console
[12:41:25] <tidalwav1> systemfault: that's what I get for pasting templates into the console like an idiot
[12:42:00] <tidalwav1> [jmc]: nope, not me
[12:45:12] <tidalwav1> thanks for setting me straight
[12:45:16] <velcrobots> Can someone help with this fiddle?  I want the different sections to nicely slide open and closed when clicking on the green squares: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/Z53yc/
[12:45:22] <superjacaman> hey guys i'm having a awkward issue with a form in ie7... if i use .submit to verify a value in a field the form stop the submit event
[12:47:03] <NoiseEee> don't name anything 'submit'
[12:48:13] <slick-> my j query date picker appears to be all wonky...
[12:48:14] <superjacaman> i've 4 buttons to submit the form and this can't change
[12:48:18] <slick-> is there a default theme i can apply to it?
[12:51:44] <BillCriswell> Thinking seriously about ditching IE7 completely. Feels good.
[12:52:02] <mouses> how do you guys feel about responsive design? im learning css media queries now. seems kinda tedious
[12:52:49] <systemfault> It's not that bad...
[12:52:54] <BillCriswell> mouses: It's awesome in the hands of the right person and completely opposite in other hands.
[12:53:38] <mouses> im wondering if it's worth it for my simple person website
[12:54:06] <mouses> its just a site with a bio, photo gallery, videos, contact for an artist
[12:54:12] <systemfault> Depends.. if you're a frontend, then yes..
[12:54:18] <mouses> single page design
[12:54:34] <tomasm-> is there a way that an object could be both resizable AND draggable? and the system know to resize instead of drag, when doing so within a certain number of pixels from the edge?
[12:54:47] <systemfault> mouses: A simple website for an artist.. I'd say that it's optional
[12:55:06] <BillCriswell> mouses: If it's for an artist they're probably going to be picky about every single pixel. Make it clear this approach isn't always pixel perfect haha.
[12:55:27] <mouses> hmm
[12:56:05] <EyePulp> anyone using requireJS on the client-side?  We're looking at a better way to break up our jquery modules, and it seems like a decent possibility...
[12:57:48] <BillCriswell> mouses: Like... say they look at the site at an awkward browser width it might look like "gappy" if it's not handled well
[12:58:47] <mouses> my site is as simple as this single page design: http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/basketball/kobe-8-system
[12:59:30] <mouses> i just want a fluid main banner image and maybe some of the blocks disappearing at small widths
[12:59:58] <BillCriswell> mouses: Yeah, they might get picky about having to stretch and shrink an image. :)
[13:00:15] <BillCriswell> That search button does some weird stuff at narrow widths.
[13:00:41] <mouses> so you're saying its good to be responsive in this case?
[13:00:44] <mouses> or bad?
[13:01:15] <BillCriswell> That search button at narrow widths like.. zooms open then closes quick. That just seems broekn
[13:01:17] <BillCriswell> broken*
[13:03:04] <mouses> hmm
[13:04:01] <BillCriswell> Over all this is pretty snazzy though :)
[13:04:11] <BillCriswell> Wish I was doing fun stuff like this.
[13:04:19] <BillCriswell> Well... and getting paid for it haha
[13:04:42] <mouses> i like simple, clean designs like that
[13:04:56] <BillCriswell> As do i.
[13:06:20] <BillCriswell> Speed is important to me as well.
[13:06:50] <BillCriswell> http://2012.dconstruct.org/ I think this might be one of my favorites.
[13:07:06] <delinquentme> so I'm getting JSON back from a POST ... and I'm attempting to write that data var back into the DOM ... as just text ... however the var data ... just prints out at [Object] [object]
[13:07:44] <delinquentme> [object Object] rather
[13:08:00] <delinquentme> however the chrome console viewer tells me that the json is within that object
[13:08:00] <jch2os> I'm using jquery mobile and have a big list(7k+) items.  Performance is too slow when I load the entire list, so I'm thinking I want to have them search and return the results.  Thoughts? I think I could do that where it is just a form, or I could do it with ajax
[13:08:07] <BillCriswell> delinquentme: What happens when you console.log(data)? I'm assuming you're just alerting it right now?
[13:08:34] <delinquentme> BillCriswell, correct.  and it shows the object with all the data that I want
[13:09:07] <BillCriswell> So you want to output the actual JSON code to the browser?
[13:10:09] <BillCriswell> You could do like... var json = data; alert( JSON.stringify(json );
[13:10:45] <BillCriswell> )); *
[13:10:52] <BillCriswell> Im not sad, that's a correction. =)
[13:11:06] <delinquentme> haha
[13:11:37] <delinquentme> BillCriswell, +1
[13:11:45] <BillCriswell> That is a really sad emoticon.
[13:12:17] <BillCriswell> delinquentme: Not sure about IE's support of JSON.stringify, but you can find a polyfill jawn for it.
[13:12:55] <delinquentme> @_@;;;
[13:13:06] <hugo_moss> is there a way to disable clicks on a div with many buttons, without removing the click event handlers that were attached for each button?
[13:13:43] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You would just attach click events to the buttons.
[13:14:22] <hugo_moss> right but if i want to disable clicking on those buttons without removing their handlers?
[13:14:56] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: I'm confused.
[13:15:03] <hugo_moss> so am i
[13:15:51] <velcrobots> can someone help me in animating the open/closing when clicking on the green squares?  http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/Z53yc/
[13:16:43] <Husel> Hey, I have the following: HTML: <li class="link"><a>Link</a></li>  JQuery: $("li.link").click(function(event){load($(event.target).children("a:first").html() + ".html")}); How do I select the inner html of the <a> tags properly? this gives undefined
[13:16:54] <smill> hi I need to set some element's width based on how long some text is, I can do $("#element").width() for the text and it works but is there a way to translate this into em units?
[13:18:45] <limpc> $$('.buttoncss').each(function(idx) { });  that should work on a page where I have a bunch of elements defined as <button class='buttoncss'></button>,  correct?
[13:19:15] <systemfault> Not with 2 $
[13:19:27] <limpc> doesnt $$ return an array of elements?
[13:19:41] <systemfault> $$ is nothing.
[13:19:51] <systemfault> At least, in jQuery.
[13:19:59] <NoiseEee> limpc: $$ is prototype.js syntax
[13:20:10] <vlad_starkov> Question: is it possible to move element to another place in DOM (absolutely different place) and keep all the bindings in safe?
[13:21:04] <limpc> $('.buttoncss') doesnt appear to trigger, though.
[13:21:17] <NoiseEee> limpc: are you sure you're using jquery?
[13:21:21] <limpc> yes
[13:21:32] <limpc> $(document).ready(function()  fires
[13:21:41] <NoiseEee> could still be prototype
[13:21:46] <limpc> theres no prototype
[13:21:55] <BillCriswell> vlad_starkov: $('#el').clone(true);
[13:22:26] <NoiseEee> limpc: providing you're calling the script after the DOM elements are in place, $('.buttoncss') will return a jquery object full of all elements with that class :)
[13:22:31] <vlad_starkov> BillCriswell: so this will keep all existing bindings active?
[13:22:37] <BillCriswell> vlad_starkov: Yes.
[13:22:50] <vlad_starkov> BillCriswell: Thnx!
[13:22:51] <jonclark> sometimes i forget to add "true" to clone() and it makes me a sad panda
[13:23:06] <BillCriswell> jonclark: Haha.
[13:24:01] <jonclark> oh and vlad_starkov you can chain after that, i.e. $('#el').clone(true).appendTo('#myDiv')
[13:24:10] <limpc> NoiseEee: the $('.buttoncss').each() is inside $(document).ready(function() { } ..
[13:24:21] <limpc> domready fires, but $('.buttoncss') does not
[13:24:25] <jonclark> usually neater to cache the cloned element into a variable though and then do your stuff with it
[13:24:26] <limpc> no errors in console
[13:24:49] <vlad_starkov> jonclark: nice!
[13:24:51] <vlad_starkov> thnx
[13:25:41] <limpc> NoiseEee: if i do console.log($('.buttoncss')) it prints an empty object in console
[13:26:09] <NoiseEee> limpc: what can i tell you, you have no elements in the document with the class .buttoncss
[13:26:47] <limpc> well i do.  if i type $$('.buttoncss') in firebug console, it lists an array of elements matching the css selector
[13:27:06] <NoiseEee> limpc: then you are using PROTOTYPE
[13:27:06] <smill> is there a sane way to convert $("#sometext").width() into em units?
[13:27:17] <NoiseEee> limpc: there is no $$ in query.
[13:27:21] <NoiseEee> s/query/jquery/
[13:27:52] <limpc> i know.
[13:28:31] <jonclark> smill just a guess, divide value by that element's computed font-size in px
[13:28:36] <limpc> nm i found the problem.  typo in spelling
[13:31:23] <ilian_> Hi
[13:31:31] <jonclark> sup, ilian_ ?
[13:31:45] <ilian_> is there a way to prevent autocomplete from closing based on what is selected?
[13:34:00] <jonclark> prevent from closing.. do you mean once you click the value, if it matches something, insert it into the text input but leave the autocomplete box open?
[13:35:25] <Husel> Hey, I have the following: HTML: <li class="link"><a>Link</a></li>  JQuery: $("li.link").click(function(event){load($(event.target).children("a:first").html() + ".html")}); How do I select the inner html of the <a> tags properly? this gives undefined
[13:37:37] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, is one global variable defined in one .js file not available in another .js file? The calling js file is included in the html just at the next line as the inclusion of the defining .js file
[13:39:31] <BillCriswell> Husel: If event.target is an <a> element there's no children a elements.
[13:39:51] <Husel> isn't event.target the li element?
[13:40:02] <BillCriswell> Husel: Not if the <a> triggered it.
[13:40:18] <BillCriswell> You probably want $(this).children('a:first').html()
[13:41:02] <BillCriswell> Husel: Not sure why it took me so long to catch that. Read it like 10 times lol.
[13:41:02] <Husel> but isn't it triggered here? $("li.link").click
[13:41:21] <BillCriswell> If you click the <a> inside the <li> you're still clicking the <li>.
[13:41:23] <Husel> i'm probably misunderstanding
[13:41:56] <Husel> if i click not on the text but still in the li, i get the same result
[13:42:00] <BillCriswell> Husel: With your existing script if you clicked the <li> without clicking the <a> it should work.
[13:42:43] <Husel> maybe bootstrap is making the text show as a block or something
[13:43:48] <Husel> ah, you're right, it works as you say without bootstrap
[13:43:49] <noregret> my app is only one page that uses ajax, now after some time of inactivity, the user session expires so each ajax call following call will result in a 403 forbidden, how can I catch that and reload teh page?
[13:45:19] <BillCriswell> Husel: http://jsbin.com/oqadij/1/edit and take a look in the console. e.target is not always $(this).
[13:45:25] <BillCriswell> Well, this.
[13:45:44] <Husel> BillCriswell: it's working perfectly now, thanks :) I thought I was clicking on the li, but it was the a, due to the CSS
[13:45:56] <Husel> i'll have a look. thanks :)
[13:46:09] <BillCriswell> Husel: You probably just want the event on the <a>.
[13:46:25] <BillCriswell> This way you can do e.preventDefault() and not follow the link.
[13:47:24] <BillCriswell> Then you just got $(this).html().
[13:49:08] <Husel> BillCriswell: it's working :)
[13:49:33] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[13:49:48] <mouses> hey i just tried to make my site responsive, then realized that i use a few sliding animations of large photos and thumbnails that assume the page width and number of thumbs being displayed stays the same
[13:50:08] <BillCriswell> mouses: Yeah, one of the many hurdles haha
[13:50:10] <mouses> if RWD is all css based, i would need to link this data to my json data file containing the settings somehow
[13:50:23] <mouses> im about to say fuck it
[13:50:28] <BillCriswell> I don't think it's right to say it's completely CSS based.
[13:50:28] <mouses> and not make the site responsive
[13:50:45] <BillCriswell> Responsiveness isn't right for every site, especially if it's an after thought.
[13:50:48] <mouses> i have sliding thumbnails and banner images
[13:51:20] <mouses> theres no way i can use my sliding algorithms if i choose to not display certain thumbs and start resizing widths on the fly
[13:51:33] <mouses> i mean correct me if i'm wrong
[13:51:41] <mouses> but it seems like thats a recipe for headache
[13:51:48] <mouses> to try to make it responsive
[13:52:25] <BillCriswell> mouses: It can be tough in some cases.
[13:54:09] <NoiseEee> mouses: personally, if its not a mandate/project requirement, i'd leave responsive images for a little while until the dust settles on how its going to be implemented into the spec, and what best practices will be etc
[13:54:41] <mouses> cool
[13:54:59] <mouses> i used to be a professional developer 5 yrs ago for a sw company but i quit
[13:55:09] <mouses> now i am doing it on my own and trying to get back to the standards
[13:55:21] <BillCriswell> mouses: A 5 year hiatus would destroy me haha.
[13:55:21] <mouses> so i didnt want to be old school and not be up to date
[13:55:46] <BillCriswell> mouses: Use  table with width="100%" ;)
[13:56:44] <BillCriswell> Use a table*
[13:58:08] <mouses> lol it hasnt been that long
[13:58:15] <danheberden> twss
[13:58:33] <mouses> i used to use mootools and html4, css2 etc
[13:58:44] <mouses> now im on jquery, html5, css3
[13:58:52] <mouses> so i'm rusty
[13:59:17] <BillCriswell> What did you do for those 5 years?
[13:59:20] <mouses> but fuck it. responsive aint that important to me cuz i'd rather have my sliding animation
[13:59:36] <mouses> i changed careers. i am a filmmaker now
[13:59:49] <BillCriswell> That's fun.
[14:00:01] <NoiseEee> slight income downturn
[14:00:55] <BillCriswell> I kind of want to go live in the woods.
[14:01:35] <BillCriswell> Donate all the money I don't have to a good cause and hang out with some moose.
[14:02:21] <NoiseEee> gets boring after a day
[14:02:46] <BillCriswell> Maybe you were hanging out with the wrong moose!
[14:03:01] <BillCriswell> I know it would be, but it's what I'd like to do RIGHT NOW.
[14:03:12] <BillCriswell> It'll change 5 times before the end of the week.
[14:04:13] <mouses> hold on, www.hulu.com was able to do what i want to do.. check out how they can still slide the thumbnails at diff page widths
[14:04:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's definitely possible. It's if the juice is worth the squeeze.
[14:04:51] <mouses> that js code must be disgusting
[14:05:12] <BillCriswell> They're Hulu. It can't be that bad haha.
[14:05:31] <mouses> i'm guessing they implemented RWD in js instead of .css files
[14:05:49] <mouses> had to be
[14:05:55] <mouses> but yeah, its not worth it to me
[14:06:00] <BillCriswell> They're certain aspects that would require JS, sure.
[14:08:52] <mouses> shit aint worth it
[14:09:12] <mouses> oh well, at least i got a little smarter
[14:09:18] <mouses> 12 hours down the drain
[14:14:29] <mouses> i used wordpress to host my blog within my site, 5 years ago. is this still the most recommended nowadays?
[14:14:38] <mouses> how is tumblr?
[14:15:52] <systemfault> wordpress is still the most widely used one...
[14:16:02] <systemfault> And probably the best from a user point of view.
[14:20:11] <mouses> ok
[14:24:08] <Jon47> they don't fill exactly the same needs - wordpress is very powerful and highly customizable but can be a pain to work with, tumblr is more straightforward but i think doesn't give you as many options
[14:24:21] <Jon47> that's my take at least
[14:26:22] <BillCriswell> systemfault: You think wordpress admin is more useable than tumblrs?
[14:26:29] <BillCriswell> Do you think*
[14:26:50] <illmat> hey guys, i want that the two lines in the header #line1 & #line2 fade in like the image right of them, .fadeIn() doesn't work as expected http://www.voka-kl.com/ [script.js]
[14:34:17] <szonek> any idea why slidedown('slow') shows all the content instantly instead of sliding it down? http://wieszjakjest.net/easy/ (click on "read more" in capabilities section)
[14:35:12] <szonek> it works just fine with other sections
[14:39:20] <limpc> how do you chain after an animation?
[14:39:26] <limpc> like element.slideUp('slow').remove()
[14:39:37] <Caelum> if I have an "attachment", that could be an image or a pdf, is there a nice way to make a thumbnail for it dynamically?
[14:39:39] <limpc> .remove() is firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[14:39:40] <b-ot> limpc, memorised ‚Äúremove()‚Äù.
[14:40:02] <Caelum> limpc: maybe .done()
[14:40:29] <systemfault> Not sure who posses bot-t but damn... using . as a trigger was stupid.
[14:40:31] <limpc> b-ot: ah thanks
[14:41:07] <systemfault> .b-bot is b-bot is stupid because it uses the . operator as a trigger
[14:41:07] <b-ot> systemfault, memorised ‚Äúb-bot‚Äù.
[14:41:45] <limpc> heh well it had the right suggestion ;)
[14:41:55] <Caelum> also, is there something that will show a thumbnail of a pdf?
[14:42:06] <limpc> element.slideUp('slow', function() { $(this).remove(); });
[14:42:15] <Caelum> I should probably just check for .pdf extension and show some icon
[14:51:24] <motaka2> how can I unserialaze a serialized string like an associative array ?
[14:52:36] <Caelum> JSON.parse(str) ?
[14:52:52] <Caelum> or do you mean url encoded
[14:53:28] <systemfault> I wish jquery has a deparam or something like that..
[14:58:40] <motaka2> Caelum: i mean the reverse for this function http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:59:30] <szonek> any idea why slidedown('slow') shows all the content instantly instead of sliding it down? http://wieszjakjest.net/easy/ (click on "read more" in capabilities section)
[14:59:33] <szonek> it works just fine with other sections
[15:07:38] <czytacz> my guess would be that the right panel just appears there
[15:07:44] <Stub> Paul
[15:07:47] <Stub> Irish
[15:07:57] <nomad111> hey all, using jquery I'm calling $(node).css('-webkit-animation', 'rotate-hand 60s -14s steps(60, end) infinite'). I have the keyframes for rotate-hand defined in css but the animation does not kick off. can anyone help me figure it out?
[15:08:28] <czytacz> szonek: you are changing the layout there, not uncovering it
[15:09:18] <bil`> how many loops does it roughly take for the differences between $.each and a native for loop to become apparent? are we talking hundreds or many thousands?
[15:10:03] <Stub> Bil, 300k+
[15:10:19] <bil`> cool thanks
[15:10:36] <systemfault> bil`: .each is a LOT slower but... it creates a new scope which is good... and also, it's pretty much never JS that's slowing down your page and always DOM calls.
[15:11:26] <bil`> what do you mean makes a new scope? the context of 'this' ?
[15:12:19] <coldhead> Stub++
[15:14:10] <Stub> coldhead what does that mean?
[15:16:56] <systemfault> bil`: scope of "this", of your variables..
[15:17:37] <bil`> ah yeah.. could be good or bad i suppose
[15:20:02] <Caelum> js in modern browsers runs in a JIT, so I'd think things like the difference between .each and a plain loop would not be that big
[15:26:42] <Caelum> speaking of deparameterizing, I actually need to get the query params out of the url for this
[15:31:18] <systemfault> Hmm.. so it's true after all ? http://www.adobe.com/downloads/cs2_downloads/index.html
[15:39:17] <scar> how can i use .fadeOut() without having it actually go to display:none; or the equivalent? i basically want to "fade out" the opacity from 100 to 0, then do a callback, then fade back in
[15:43:04] <scar> .animate :D
[16:08:44] <waynr> i need help with jquery
[16:09:03] <waynr> what is DOM
[16:10:48] <coldhead> waynr: why don't you try asking your questions to google first and asking here when google gives up on you
[16:10:49] <matteu> Is nobody going to help the poor guy?
[16:11:47] <waynr> cause i am working on my okcupid profile
[16:11:53] <coldhead> jesus helps those who help themselves
[16:12:36] <EyePulp> How is DOMMY formed?
[16:15:38] <matteu> How you mine for DOM elements
[16:16:18] <coldhead> domcraft?
[16:27:15] <greg5green> you give some peasants some axes or shovels or something
[16:27:19] <greg5green> and start digging a hole
[16:27:41] <greg5green> you may or may not hit dom, but its easier than panning
[16:30:07] <matteu> I blame DOM for ruining the economy
[16:31:50] <Caelum> systemfault: isn't cs2 ancient? why would anyone want it?
[16:32:11] <coldhead> people don't want herpes but they still get it
[16:34:14] <Caelum> and wtf is with this wordpress crap, it's like everyone is using for everything, I thought it was a fucking blog
[16:36:21] <coldhead> try not to panic, Caelum
[16:36:32] <coldhead> people do a lot of crazy stuff
[16:37:04] <tw2113> like use cobol
[16:37:05] <b-ot> tw2113, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[16:37:05] <bot-t> (10 hours 50 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell tw2113 thanks re: topic change ping
[16:37:23] <tw2113> b-ot, read to me
[16:37:29] <tw2113> read to me
[16:37:35] <tw2113> boo
[16:38:01] <tw2113> i was hoping for audio in Morgan Freeman's voice
[16:38:22] <matteu> get busy livin, or get busy workin
[16:38:56] <Forbidd3n> when I add a node to my page and I have this set -- $('.delUtilityRateClass').live('click', function(){ ... }); -- it isn't accessing the function even though the class on the added node has the .delUtilityRateClass class
[16:39:01] <ralphholzmann> coldhead: confirmed on herpes
[16:40:26] <Forbidd3n> anyone on the .live concept not working?
[16:40:41] <scathen^C> hey all, anyone know how to detect a selection change (eg. user highlights text) of a particular element?
[16:41:59] <coldhead> concept?
[16:42:30] <RobW> scathen^C: http://mark.koli.ch/2009/09/use-javascript-and-jquery-to-get-user-selected-text.html
[16:42:30] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: not concept, but for what I have
[16:42:45] <RobW> Forbidd3n: isn't it .on() now?
[16:43:02] <coldhead> RobW++
[16:43:06] <Forbidd3n> what v. of jquery is .on?
[16:43:11] <RobW> your mom
[16:43:21] <RobW> HAHA that was funny.. i mean, I'm not sure
[16:43:28] <RobW> thought 1.6 or 7
[16:43:40] <Forbidd3n> so it is .on('click', function(){...});
[16:43:42] <RobW> by a quick google, it shows 1.7
[16:43:45] <RobW> yessirr
[16:43:54] <scathen^C> RobW: i know how to get selections and manipulate them. i was asking if you could detect a user selection change for a particular element
[16:44:54] <RobW> a form element, or any element?
[16:45:11] <scathen^C> i am using a content editable div
[16:45:28] <Forbidd3n> .on isn't working either and since it isn't calling the function I can't see the error if any
[16:46:08] <scathen^C> i was trying mouseup and keyup, but that only partially solves the problem, as a user can select text but mouseup outside the element.
[16:46:42] <coldhead> it's a hard problem, scathen^C
[16:46:56] <RobW> scathen^C: you may be binding a listener on the wrong element, then.
[16:47:07] <scathen^C> i could use document.mouseup, but then i would need to figure out if any of the selected ranges fall within the elemtn
[16:47:49] <RobW> scathen^C: and there lies another problem. tbh, you're in quite a predicament
[16:48:28] <scathen^C> hrm, i feel a blog post coming on. surprised no one has done this well yet...
[17:01:58] <scathen^C> figured out a simple answer. i simply have to check if the element i desire has focus as the time of document mouse interaction...
[17:03:47] <hugo_moss> If i have two animating menus, and a button that animates both menus at the same time, how can i disable the button, when one is animating and not the other, or when both are animating?
[17:05:11] <Armistice> Hey I've been having problems since the update to JQ 1.9, I have a HashChange event which did once use $.browser but I replaced this with a BrowserDetect plugin. That seems to work fine but it's possible other changes occurred in jQuery causing this to be at fault. http://pastecan.com/#cpp the syntax highlighting menu should be set as C++ however it will not be set until you actually click the menu. So it is detect a hashchange event
[17:05:27] <Armistice> If you need code, I'll paste it but you shouldn't as all code is in the Source of that page.
[17:05:46] <gnarf> Armistice: have you tried including jquery-migrate ?
[17:06:02] <gnarf> Armistice: it has warnings for pretty much everything that was removed or changed
[17:06:03] <gnarf> also
[17:06:24] <gnarf> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[17:07:09] <gnarf> Armistice: be sure to include the development version of migrate
[17:07:14] <gnarf> for the warnings
[17:07:41] <gnarf> Armistice: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/tree/1.0.0#download
[17:08:41] <Armistice> It's odd though, http://fiddle.jshell.net/jgWZm/2/show/#foo I tested it out here and it works fine... but I'll look at the links you ahve suggested.
[17:09:17] <gnarf> Armistice: sounds like further debugging is needed anyway
[17:09:22] <gnarf> might as well turn on migrate to test
[17:09:23] <gnarf> :)
[17:09:39] <RobW> ^
[17:11:27] <Armistice> Only warning I get is: jQuery.fn.attr(selected) may use property instead of attribute
[17:11:59] <Armistice> $(this).attr('selected', 'selected'); I use this, what should it be instead?
[17:12:06] <RobW> use .prop
[17:12:22] <Armistice> wow
[17:12:46] <Armistice> That fixed it, I'm surprised.
[17:12:54] <RobW> :]
[17:14:27] <Armistice> Thanks guys :) JQ Migrate is sassy.
[17:18:53] <gnarf> your welcome
[17:18:58] <gnarf> my idea ‚Ñ¢ ;)

[17:36:39] <aghouseh> does anyone know if its possible to extend a jquery function, ie addClass() to do your own custom logic and then fire the parent $.addClass() function?
[17:36:59] <coldhead> yes
[17:37:04] <coldhead> just save a reference to the original
[17:37:08] <coldhead> and call it from your replacement
[17:37:27] <aghouseh> excellent.
[17:37:30] <aghouseh> that makes sense
[17:37:36] <tw2113> coldhead, you should consider http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5170591378#

[17:43:37] <coldhead> LORENZO DE MEDICI, tw2113
[17:43:58] <BillCriswell> I just google him... not very interesting based on the first sentence of Wikipedia.
[17:43:59] <tw2113> get a job!
[17:44:09] <BillCriswell> Attention span kind of ended after that.
[17:44:41] <aghouseh> thx
[17:44:55] <Es0teric> whats up people
[17:45:11] <coldhead> BillCriswell: point is he was one of the wealthiest people in europe
[17:45:17] <coldhead> here endeth the lesson
[17:45:20] <gnarf> Es0teric: something....
[17:45:25] <BillCriswell> So it's like saying Rockafeller or something
[17:45:35] <tw2113> the ceiling Es0teric
[17:45:45] <Es0teric> o.O
[17:45:46] <BillCriswell> rockefeller, even

[17:46:34] <BillCriswell> That must have been after the first sentence. =p
[17:46:43] <tw2113> yeah
[17:46:46] <tw2113> sentence 2
[17:47:05] <BillCriswell> Well, you see the situation I was in.
[17:47:52] <gnarf> Es0teric: it's like the 14 days of jquery all over again
[17:48:05] <Es0teric> wait what?
[17:48:05] <Es0teric> lmao
[17:48:38] <mehwork> what's the difference between: $(function() and  $(function($)
[17:49:18] <gnarf> mehwork: not much, but that function is passed jQuery as it's first argument... jQuery(function($) { makes a lot more sense because that would ensure that $ = jQuery even if jQuery.noConflict() had been used
[17:49:41] <mehwork> thx
[17:52:32] <kerozene> how can I pass an argument into a filter function, in $.grep() for example?
[17:54:02] <kerozene> my function takes an argument and does grep on it. how can I use it in the filter?
[17:55:13] <gnarf> kerozene: example code?
[17:55:32] <BillCriswell> kerozene: Yeah, I think something is getting overcomplicated here.
[17:55:39] <kerozene> http://jsfiddle.net/WduxN/20/
[17:57:58] <Es0teric> for some reason, when i submit a contact form, i get NetworkError: 400 Bad Request
[17:58:42] <BillCriswell> I'm a little more confused than where I started.
[17:58:45] <Es0teric> why is that? i submitted the form once
[17:58:56] <kerozene> BillCriswell: how so
[17:59:18] <kerozene> look at /19/ for a working version
[18:00:19] <jeremy-> Is there anyway to format a date object which is json, sec/usec (eg, "date":{"sec":1358726400,"usec":0} ) using the datepicker jquery class or will i have to format using the serverside first
[18:00:39] <jeremy-> Well i'm sure there's a way, i mean an easy way :D
[18:01:12] <RobW> Date() class can
[18:01:20] <kerozene> gnarf: any ideas?
[18:01:47] <tw2113> jeremy-, looks like a utc timestamp
[18:01:52] <jeremy-> yes, i noticed that on a stack overflow, my problem is that I was hoping to use a native method of "datatables" (the jquery plugin), to convert the date, and it seems to allow datepicker but not date()
[18:02:09] <jeremy-> Its because im using mongodb for my serverside, theres not much documentation for it
[18:02:20] <jeremy-> I guess i'll look at a callback and just use date() like you suggested
[18:02:43] <tw2113> look around for how to turn unix timestamps to human dates with js
[18:02:56] <jeremy-> yes, i found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8079042/form-json-date-to-js-date
[18:03:01] <gnarf> kerozene: use a function( el ) { filterRegExp(el, find); }
[18:03:03] <jeremy-> I'll just have to work out how to write a callback so i can use that
[18:03:10] <jeremy-> Thanks guys, helpful troubleshooting
[18:03:23] <kerozene> gnarf: I see. thanks :)
[18:05:48] <kerozene> gnarf: this may sound dumb but what's wrong with compare = filterRegExp; $.grep($cache, function(el) { compare(el, find); })
[18:06:09] <kerozene> oops, return compare. should be

[19:10:53] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[19:16:50] <Forbidd3n> anyone know what would cause .on('click', function(){...}); not to work when elements are added to the DOM?
[19:18:24] <b1lly> yes
[19:18:27] <b1lly> no
[19:19:34] <coldhead> you have to use the other signature when you want delegation

[19:20:24] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: not binding it. I am generating a new tr with ajax call and returning html and the delete link has the class on it
[19:20:40] <b1lly> i mean the function
[19:21:09] <Forbidd3n> this is my function - $('.delUtilityRateClass').on('click', function(event){event.preventDefault();  ...});
[19:21:13] <b1lly> $(document.body').on('click','selector', function() {
[19:21:41] <Forbidd3n> and when I add a new element it has class="delUtilityRateClass" on it

[19:21:51] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: I did
[19:21:56] <Forbidd3n> you can't do it the way I am doing it?
[19:22:04] <Forbidd3n> hmm, you would think both would work
[19:22:05] <b1lly> nope
[19:22:08] <b1lly> no
[19:22:18] <b1lly> they work differently
[19:24:47] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: still didn't work
[19:25:04] <Forbidd3n> it still follows the link
[19:28:07] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: ?
[19:28:59] <b1lly> jsfiddle.net it
[19:29:35] <Forbidd3n> ok one sec
[19:44:01] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: nvm I have it working. I was mispelling the stupid class. thanks for the help
[19:44:17] <Forbidd3n> why doesn't the option I originally had work?
[19:44:51] <b1lly> because your trying to listen to an event from an element that doesnt exist
[19:45:09] <b1lly> the other way, listens to a body click and looks for the element on the way up the tree (from where you cliked)
[19:45:17] <b1lly> so it works on dynamically added dom elements
[20:09:32] <omg|its|otr> I have a page that has a series of divs with class "post" and unique IDs. There is a button in one of these divs that I want to onclick return the id of the div.post that is containing the button.
[20:09:57] <omg|its|otr> But when I onlick this.parents() it returns whole DOM tree and all of the div.post's
[20:10:39] <tw2113> try .parent()
[20:11:22] <omg|its|otr> Yeah, tw2113 except that the <div> is multiple levels up. I could theoretically .parent().parent().parent() etc. but that doesn't seem very clean.
[20:14:55] <omg|its|otr> Ah, I figured it out with .closest().
[20:24:44] <CakePlease> anyone still here to answer a quick syntax question?
[20:28:11] <kerozene> was there an evacuation or something?
[20:28:48] <versatiletech> CakePlease: yeap
[20:29:05] <CakePlease> oh good
[20:29:11] <coldhead> anyone free to answer a question about whether they're free to answer a question for me?
[20:29:13] <coldhead> PM me for details
[20:29:25] <CakePlease> is it ok to nest a plugin in a function as such:
[20:29:54] <versatiletech> pastebin
[20:29:56] <versatiletech> if it's long
[20:30:41] <munderwo-work> Hi all, does anyboyd know if the datatables library has its own irc?
[20:30:41] <CakePlease> function myfunkyfunc(){
[20:30:41] <CakePlease> $.fn.funkyplug = funtion()(){....};
[20:30:41] <CakePlease> $('foo').funkyplug();
[20:30:41] <CakePlease> }
[20:32:41] <CakePlease> any ideas?
[20:33:00] <coldhead> why do you want to do it that way, CakePlease ?
[20:33:05] <versatiletech> umm yes you can do that, but then you'd have to call myfunkyfunc() at least once before you could use $('member:foo').funkyplug() any where else
[20:33:16] <versatiletech> why would you want to do that?
[20:33:24] <CakePlease> yes, it is clunky i agree
[20:34:30] <CakePlease> but there is a widget that im creating that runs foriegn environments, and i need to load my own jquery as well as assign it it's own object
[20:34:50] <CakePlease> so the plugin needs to be within the scope of my own jquery object
[20:47:02] <versatiletech> CakePlease: if you're using noConflict() then you could use a closure to pass it the version of jQuery you want like this http://jsbin.com/ofojil/1/edit
[20:47:52] <raj> how can I check to see if sortable is initialized?
[20:50:26] <raj> ajpiano, ping
[20:54:16] <CakePlease> versatiletech: yep i am, but yah, i dont know how things got to how they are
[20:54:16] <CakePlease> haha
[20:54:28] <CakePlease> i'll try and fix as much as i can
[20:57:14] <CakePlease> oh i see
[20:57:44] <CakePlease> the wrapping function loops itself until it sees that the jquery is loaded
[20:58:01] <CakePlease> only when this condition is successful, the plugin gets executed
[21:01:31] <ChrisBolton> Can someone help me debug this ‚Ä¶ http://pastie.org/5701386 . I'm getting a "syntax error, unexpected keyword_ensure, expecting $end" at the end of the file.
[21:01:37] <ChrisBolton> Sorry wrong room.
[21:50:32] <tfittsy> if you use $.getScript is there any way to use variables outside of that script or is it basically run as a function with only local variables?
[22:01:29] <shoky> it's run as is, like any script
[22:01:40] <tds5016> hey. I am wondering.... is there a way to use drag and drop where you have to hold the element before enabling drag?
[22:02:39] <tds5016> not where you are holding then moving the mouse.... I want it where if you move a certain distance, it cancels the drag.
[22:02:51] <mindis|wurk> hmm, i wonder how i manage to get different values from an object when using console.log to log the entire object and when logging its variables seperately
[22:03:06] <shoky> tds5016: jquery ui draggable
[22:03:22] <tds5016> shoky: draggable doesn't work that way from what I understand.
[22:03:35] <shoky> tds5016: have you looked through the different options?
[22:04:08] <tds5016> basically if you set the distance it will continue dragging after 5pixes or whatever is set.
[22:04:45] <shoky> what
[22:04:50] <tds5016> leme start over.
[22:05:01] <tds5016> basically it doesn't enable dragging after holding for x amount of time...
[22:05:21] <tds5016> it will allow you to start the click and and then move the mouse.
[22:05:29] <tds5016> and then the element will move to the mouse position.
[22:05:39] <tds5016> what I want is that you click and hold, and THEN it begins dragging.
[22:05:53] <shoky> you didnt answer my question
[22:06:10] <tds5016> have I looked throughout he options question?
[22:06:24] <shoky> only one i asked
[22:06:26] <tds5016> I've looked, but no promises I didn't misunderstand it.
[22:06:31] <shoky> well, except 'what' :\
[22:06:35] <tds5016> ;-)
[22:06:49] <shoky> seen this..? http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#delay-start
[22:07:40] <tds5016> yeah, that does what I don't want.
[22:08:06] <tds5016> what that does is allow you to hold and move your mouse....
[22:08:11] <shoky> ok.. what is it you want again
[22:08:20] <tds5016> and then after 1000ms it will move to your mouses position.
[22:09:01] <tds5016> what I want is when you click if you move 5 pixels or some range of distance, it cancels the drag
[22:09:09] <tds5016> so you have to actually hold before clicking.
[22:11:14] <tds5016> does what I'm saying make sense?
[22:13:26] <shoky> you can try adding a 'drag' event handler that cancels the drag by returning false
[22:14:06] <tds5016> hmm, drag: function()?
[22:14:08] <yakko> maybe e.preventDefault() //I'm just shooting here, didnt read the whole story
[22:14:08] <shoky> (if the distance is outside the range while still during the timeout)
[22:14:30] <tds5016> shoky hmm, how would I set the timeout?
[22:14:34] <shoky> tds5016: drag: function( event, ui ) {}
[22:14:59] <tds5016> how would I get the distance with drag?
[22:15:21] <tds5016> shoky: thanks btw
[22:15:22] <shoky> handle the start event too
[22:15:41] <shoky> get the position from the ui argument
[22:15:59] <tds5016> nice.
[22:20:20] <tds5016> shoky will drag overwrite the actual dragging code?
[22:20:55] <tds5016> or will it just give me the option to add to it?
[22:21:55] <shoky> nah it doesnt overwrite that default stuff
[22:22:01] <shoky> the*
[22:22:46] <tds5016> awesome! Thanks for your help!!

[22:40:52] <gnarf> Usama: we are a support channel, this is probably not the right place to shop for a freelancer...
[22:41:20] <gnarf> theres some channel on freenode that people suggest
[22:41:23] <gnarf> but i don't remember it
[22:42:19] <coldhead> #freelancers
[22:42:26] <Usama> ok great...thanks gnarf....if anyone is interested to work pls add me on skype: usama.kw
[22:42:32] <coldhead> or maybe it's #freelance
[22:42:35] <coldhead> somie lie da

[22:42:41] <gnarf> maybe/

[22:48:46] <Usama> Is it possible to add a html tag in .show(
[22:58:09] <delinquentme> so I'm running an .each operation ... and I'd like to pass the individual item instance in the loop ... into the function that I'm performing
[22:59:08] <mindis|wurk> 'this' in each refers to the element currently in the loop
[22:59:10] <delinquentme> EX: http://jsfiddle.net/qjG9r/   where a given match for $('#ecosystem_edit').find('tr#' + k)
[22:59:25] <Nebros> are ajax functions in jquery integrated, or have i to install it aswell?
[22:59:26] <delinquentme> mindis|wurk, except when within embedded loops
[23:00:04] <delinquentme> http://jsfiddle.net/qjG9r/1/   << updated
[23:00:57] <mindis|wurk> i'm not sure what you're really trying to do there but it looks complicated in a bad way
[23:04:43] <motaka3> Is this working ?
[23:05:43] <mindis|wurk> no
[23:06:19] <motaka3> I have written this method to change a serialized string to an associative array - is it working ?
[23:06:23] <motaka3> http://pastebin.com/hpXyPQ0r
[23:08:51] <shoky> no
[23:13:02] <motaka3> shoky: Oh why not?
[23:16:03] <shoky> seriSplited wasn't defined
[23:16:15] <shoky> where is this serialized string coming from?
[23:16:19] <shoky> .serialize() ?
[23:17:22] <shoky> also no idea what you're doing in there ;p
[23:17:43] <delinquentme> size limit ? ( character limit? ) of what jQuery can read into memory?
[23:17:48] <delinquentme> does that depend on the machine?
[23:18:31] <shoky> depends on how much free memory there is, usually
[23:19:31] <gnarf> delinquentme: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2936782/javascript-memory-limit
[23:19:50] <gnarf> delinquentme: however, be careful - mobile browsers pretty much just crash and burn when you hit memory limits
[23:23:23] <shoky> motaka3: i think you meant  http://pastebin.com/Az6RB1xL
[23:24:16] <shoky> also see ?serializeArray
[23:24:17] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[23:27:49] <tiphares> how can i add an image to my html, and make sure it loads before the javscript continues?
[23:34:19] <delinquentme> change the key-string associated with a value in a hash?
[23:34:53] <Cork> tiphares: you can't make sure it load before it continues
[23:35:18] <Cork> tiphares: but you can wait for it to load, and then through a event handler do what needs to happen afterwards
[23:36:08] <gnarf> ?imagesloaded
[23:36:09] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[23:36:27] <Cork> var img = $('<img/>'); img.load(function() { /* do this when the image is loaded */ }); img.attr('src', 'url'); $(parent).append(img)
[23:52:12] <T-Co> Should this issue be fixed in 1.8.3? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485
[23:53:58] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/jquery/status/291733881768529920 btw

[23:54:58] <tiphares> Cork gnarf thanks!
[23:55:04] <tiphares> i'll look it out
[23:56:00] <gnarf> T-Co: html5 shim stuff landed in 1.7
