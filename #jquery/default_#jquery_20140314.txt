[00:04:02] <murosai_> it's a slight problem when firefox crashes everytime i try to profile my website
[00:12:31] <Cork> murosai_: #firefox and you could get some help finding what happens
[00:35:46] <d3m0n> How can I format this variable so I can put it in a find: c = $('li a[data-num="'+b+'"]');, eg: .find(c)
[00:35:47] <Xoro> How would I play audio from an <audio> tag when I trigger a slideToggle() to hide but not when it shows? Would I have to separate .hide() and .show() and just add the right code to the .show() function?
[00:35:55] <d3m0n> 'li a[data-num="'+b+'"]' ?
[00:36:06] <Cork> d3m0n: that should work
[00:36:37] <Cork> Xoro: check is(':visible')
[00:37:01] <Xoro> Ah, that would wokr. thanks.
[01:31:12] <IamTrying> Is there any Drag and Drop file unloader free (something like YouTube video upload drag and drop)
[01:31:47] <Cork> IamTrying: there are plenty of unload plugins
[01:31:56] <Cork> all of them are free as far as i remember
[01:32:15] <Cork> just fine one that has the backwards support you feel you need
[01:32:20] <Cork> and the design you like
[01:32:38] <IamTrying> Cork, Thank you, i like the YouTube file upload its very easy look and feel
[01:32:50] <Cork> never used it
[01:33:18] <IamTrying> Cork, in YouTube file upload you have a BUTTON upload on click you have a full screen of BLUE where you can place the file and its done.
[01:48:00] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise how to make this only hover show on the actual li, not all of them? http://jsfiddle.net/pp98M/
[01:49:36] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/pp98M/1/
[01:49:57] <Cork> (though i would prob do that in css instead)
[01:52:24] <benjick> Is there some nifty jquery plugin to display one tweet as it would be viewed on twitter? I remember seeing this on some newssite, but I can't remember where
[01:54:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, you would?
[01:54:52] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: css transision: opacity
[01:55:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the fading isn't important enough that i would make all the work of adding it in js
[01:55:37] <Cork> and then you can just use the :hover css psudo selector
[01:55:53] <xec> triggering it with javascript isn't a bad idea though, if you want to be able to trigger it on touch devices without delay
[01:56:16] <xec> .hover() is not the way to go in that case ;)

[01:58:02] <Yodledoo> Hi. I'm looking to create a schema driven user interface. Basically I've got a service which delivers different kinds of 'statistics' data as XML. When a user requests a certain statistic item I should fetch the XML and generate some kind of HTML table. Each cell should be editable and the users should be able to save the entire item.
[01:58:20] <Yodledoo> Which approach and framework would you recommend?
[02:00:59] <Yodledoo> The tables could vary quite a lot. The header is optional, the number of rows and cols are totally dynamic. And some rows should be able to have multiple cells within a single column, while others just have 1 cell per column
[02:07:26] <murosai_> i wonder why $.inArray(this, $.makeArray(elems)) returns 3 but $.inArray($(this), elems ) returns -1?
[02:07:59] <Yodledoo> I'm thinking about whether I should create a javascript object based on the XML and use an MV* framework like knockout/angular to bind the UI
[02:09:01] <Cork> murosai_: cause the second one sends a jquery object to inArray
[02:09:17] <Cork> murosai_: $.inArray(this, elems) should work
[02:09:55] <Cork> murosai_: $(this) takes the element this and wrapps it in a jquery object
[02:10:08] <Cork> murosai_: the object isn't the same as the dom element, so you get -1
[02:10:32] <murosai_> actually i meant $.inArray($(this), $.makeArray(elems))
[02:10:43] <murosai_> this shold be jqueryObjects as well as the array
[02:10:51] <murosai_> wtf, my typing :p
[02:11:05] <fabioportieri> murosai_: because elems is not an array ?
[02:11:08] <Cork> murosai_: no the second will just take the jquery object that is array like
[02:11:11] <murosai_> $(this) should be a jquery object, as well as the array
[02:11:12] <Cork> and convert it to a true array
[02:11:25] <Cork> elements will still be a list of dom elements
[02:11:27] <JustMozzy> hi guys. does anyone have experience with jstree?
[02:11:30] <Cork> *elems
[02:11:46] <murosai_> hm, let me check
[02:12:04] <Cork> murosai_: javascript objects can't be checked for with $.inArray
[02:12:23] <Cork> and again a jquery object can't ever be the same as a dom element
[02:12:47] <Cork> fabioportieri: it is the first element causing the problem, not the last one
[02:12:54] <Cork> *first argument
[02:13:42] <fabioportieri> cork but he said he meant $(this) even for the first case, so the only thing that differs is the second arg
[02:14:11] <Cork> fabioportieri: that isn't possible so...
[02:14:24] <Cork> $.inArray($(this), $.makeArray(elems)) can't ever return anything bug -1
[02:14:28] <Cork> *but
[02:14:35] <Cork> gah i typo a lot right now...
[02:14:42] <fabioportieri> bug is ok too :)
[02:17:13] <murosai_> also seems like $.inArray(this, elems.clone()) returns -1 and $.inArray(this, elems) returns 3
[02:17:37] <Cork> murosai_: ya, cause a clone of an element isn't the same elemnt
[02:17:54] <murosai_> does the $.inArray check if the object is an exact reference?
[02:18:00] <Cork> murosai_: only when the dom element is exactly the same will you get a hit
[02:18:16] <Cork> murosai_: it checks if val1 === val2
[02:18:21] <Cork> and you can do this with dom elements
[02:18:36] <murosai_> so how can i solve my problem them?
[02:18:52] <Cork> again $.inArray(this, elems) should work
[02:19:03] <murosai_> but i need to make a clone first
[02:19:10] <Cork> then you can't use inArray
[02:19:17] <Cork> unless you compare the clone
[02:19:23] <murosai_> what should i use instead?
[02:19:32] <Cork> array index?
[02:19:45] <Cork> but why do you need to make a clone before you compare?
[02:19:46] <murosai_> ?
[02:19:50] <Cork> doesn't really make sense
[02:20:30] <murosai_> hm, maybe i can skip that part, let me try
[02:30:49] <Yodledoo> Continuing my previous question: Would you basically work with xml directly or would you work with a javascript object all the way except for the final stage where  you generated the xml based on that js object?
[02:39:58] <DarsVaeda1> what is the syntax for show with options? .show({duration: 600, easing: "fade"}); gives me an error
[02:43:33] <hellothere> hey there, anyone familiar with jquery mobile and dialogs ?
[02:46:37] <DarsVaeda> I load the script where that code is with getScript and get a parseerror -.-
[02:47:15] <DarsVaeda> if I just do .show() everything is fine
[02:50:55] <DarsVaeda> I mean parsererror
[03:00:16] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and if you run the script inline it works?
[03:03:35] <DarsVaeda> no the same problem
[03:04:06] <DarsVaeda> before there is a template file loaded, I wonder if that is of any reason
[03:06:33] <larsemil> i have a wordpress theme, and something there is complaining about jquery not being > version 1.3 allthough i have 1.10.2 installed...
[03:07:51] <DarsVaeda> http://pastebin.com/uAvEuMmD this is the script I load
[03:08:14] <Cork> larsemil: it might be old enough that it doesn't work with jquery > 1.9
[03:08:22] <Cork> larsemil: you could try the migrate lib
[03:08:28] <Cork> ?g jquery-migrate
[03:08:30] <b-ot> Cork: jquery/jquery-migrate Â· GitHub â†’ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[03:09:15] <DarsVaeda> can I get more information than just "parsererror"?
[03:09:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: wai you meen this script fails to parse if you have line 29
[03:09:40] <Cork> but not if you replace it with line 27?
[03:09:59] <DarsVaeda> right
[03:10:22] <Cork> DarsVaeda: i would stick it into a <script> tag and check the error console
[03:10:33] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and no i don't think jquery can get more info then that
[03:10:37] <ns5> how to do UNIX crypt(3) in javascript?
[03:11:08] <Cork> ns5: unix crypt(3) ?
[03:11:08] <DarsVaeda> hmm yeah I tried that, parsererror is all I get
[03:11:24] <ns5> Cork: yes, man 3 crypt
[03:11:31] <ns5> it's password encryption
[03:11:47] <systemfault> ns5: There's no crypto available in the browser... there are proposals for it though...
[03:11:55] <Cork> ms5: js can't do cryptography as it can't hold a secret

[03:17:22] <Cork> funny enough you would get the same problem with 2.1 and 2.0
[03:18:23] <Cork> larsemil: what i meant is i think the script checks the value of the third char

[03:22:08] <Cork> larsemil: you should be able to find it if you search for the string

[03:22:48] <DarsVaeda> .show("fade", {duration: 5000}); works
[03:23:05] <larsemil> nope not that file
[03:23:24] <DarsVaeda> .show({duration: 5000, easing: "fade"}); doesn't but as I get the docu that should be okay
[03:25:38] <Cork> DarsVaeda: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L260
[03:25:48] <DarsVaeda> :O what a second easing is not even right
[03:25:52] <DarsVaeda> wait
[03:26:09] <seutje> that's an effect
[03:27:10] <Cork> larsemil: that file is minified
[03:27:21] <Cork> larsemil: you might want to grab a development version

[03:28:36] <DarsVaeda> boy that was not really replicable
[03:44:34] <Gavrisimo> I'm using $.ajax() to load some template, and then I use $.append() to show it. That template has form with file input, checkbox and submit button, but nothing seems to be working, when I click on checkbox it does not change state, when I click on submit button it does not submit form, when I click file input I don't get that modal window to choose file. Any idea where to start looking?
[03:45:37] <Cork> Gavrisimo: are you overriding the default action in js anywhere on the page?
[03:45:42] <Gavrisimo> aaah, I think I found it... dang
[03:45:47] <Gavrisimo> yeah I just found that... :)
[04:11:42] <murosai_> what's the meaning of $(function() { ?
[04:12:13] <Cork> $(function() {}); is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {})
[04:12:20] <Cork> ?api jQuery.ready
[04:12:20] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:12:24] <Cork> O_o
[04:12:26] <murosai_> ah ok
[04:12:29] <Cork> ?api ready
[04:12:29] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[04:12:31] <Cork> ah
[04:23:27] <hellothere> i am trying to find a modal that is the same as an alert message on mobiles using the same style so i can use it on my mobile verison... nothing so far NATHA!
[04:28:15] <fabioportieri> i'm styling a long form this way: label (150px) input1 (320px) label2 (150px) input2 (320px) .. my issue is that whenever the viewport width is less then 970px the form layout screws up (input2 goes below the line, because the container is fluid).. should i care about that? i'm afraid users with old monitors will see the screwed up version of the layout
[04:28:44] <fabioportieri> i don't intend to make it responsive for tablets/cells
[04:34:42] <fabioportieri> i guess a media query is the only way around it, nvm
[04:39:56] <Cork> fabioportieri: i would set the width: 100% and max-width: 150px
[04:40:12] <Cork> fabioportieri: that way you get both
[04:40:22] <Cork> without the need for media queries
[04:40:29] <fabioportieri> Cork: oh, let me try that
[04:41:15] <fabioportieri> uhm actually
[04:41:43] <fabioportieri> my intent is to display label - input - label -input as if they were inside a table, perfectly vertical aligned
[04:42:02] <fabioportieri> so i feel forced to use a fixed width
[04:42:15] <fabioportieri> with the size of the widest input
[04:42:54] <Cork> display: table-cell might help
[04:42:57] <Cork> but ya
[04:43:26] <fabioportieri> i'm using a combination of display:block and display:inline-block atm
[04:44:19] <fabioportieri> since the form container is fluid, it get screwed when viewport is below 970px or so
[05:12:51] <xnotte> all get...() are ajax requests. How can i set a callback after all that requests are over in that function ? http://jsfiddle.net/TGxH5/
[05:14:31] <ravenzz> xnotte promises!
[05:14:32] <ravenzz> ftw
[05:14:50] <ravenzz> ?deferred @ xnotte
[05:15:23] <ravenzz> meh
[05:15:26] <ravenzz> xnotte https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juRtEEsHI9E
[05:16:42] <xnotte> ravenzz: let me check
[05:19:47] <xnotte> ravenzz: thats the only way ? or the best awu?
[05:19:50] <xnotte> way
[05:24:55] <ravenzz> both I think
[05:25:55] <Cork> xnotte: you could collect it in an array and then when the array is the expected number handle it there
[05:26:10] <Cork> xnotte: but ya, the deferred ajax gives you is by far the most efficient way
[05:26:35] <Cork> $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax(),$.ajax(),$.ajax()).done(function() {})
[05:27:43] <ravenzz> or rather function gethistoricopatologia(idpatologia) { return $.get(/* blablabla */); }
[05:28:15] <xnotte> ok Cork and ravenzz
[05:28:19] <xnotte> thank you
[05:28:42] <Cork> (didn't even check the fiddle)
[05:31:31] <xnotte> i'm going to do: $.when( gethistoricopatologia(), get,,,(),).done()
[05:38:14] <MikeD_> is there a good tutorial on the correct way to chain a series of append() and .on() behaviors?  my first attempt had the .on() method applied to the parent of the item I expected and the way I rewrote it is ugly.
[05:39:11] <Cork> MikeD_: if you want to work with what you are about to append
[05:39:34] <Cork> either have the new element in a varaible and use .on on it after you've appended it
[05:39:41] <Cork> or use appendTo
[05:39:56] <Cork> or (probably the best option) use delegated event listeners
[05:41:15] <MikeD_> so put the event on the UL and check to see if the remove button was clicked in any of its LI ?
[05:41:53] <Cork> MikeD_: $('ul').on('click', 'button', function() {})
[05:42:04] <Cork> that way you only need to add one event listener
[05:42:13] <Cork> and that will speed up your dom
[05:42:43] <Cork> <'button'> in this case can be any selector matching the target element
[05:42:50] <MikeD_> right.  tbh, it's not the dom speed that makes that a good solution, it's how much cleaner/readable the code is
[05:43:02] <Cork> well it is both
[05:43:03] <MikeD_> thanks
[05:43:45] <Cork> cause adding say 100 event listeners will noticeably slow down the speed of the entire page
[05:44:07] <MikeD_> yeah, not trying to say otherwise... just that the performance difference on 4-5 LI isn't as important as easier to read  code  (and write)
[05:45:59] <MikeD_> i know i could look it up, but does the .on() have an overloaded signature?  so the version I've been using is .on( 'click', function(){} ) - but if you put a selector as the second property it knows that the selector isn't a function and then expects the function as the third parameter?
[05:48:02] <Cork> MikeD_: no 4-5 won't even be measurable
[05:48:49] <MikeD_> ug, w3schools has a jquery section
[05:50:19] <elnur> \o/
[05:50:37] <elnur> I'm still trying to understand how to organize my jQuery code.
[05:50:52] <MikeD_> me too :)
[05:50:54] <elnur> Yesterday I was asking about RequireJS and it seems like it's good for async loading.
[05:51:25] <elnur> That all sounds good, but my current biggest question is how do I organize my jQuery code itself.
[05:52:15] <elnur> Right now I have a JS file per some feature and the code of each feature goes into $(function() {}).
[05:52:34] <elnur> I don't think that's optimal.
[05:53:35] <elnur> Does it make sense to write jQuery plugins for app specific code?
[05:54:35] <Cork> elnur: normally no
[05:54:52] <Cork> if you plan to reuse it on other sites it might
[05:55:18] <elnur> Let's say I don't.
[05:55:25] <elnur> I just want to organize code for a single project.
[05:55:46] <Cork> then it is normally over kill
[05:55:48] <elnur> Do I create a namespace object and put everything there? If not, then what?
[05:56:02] <elnur> Do I use the module pattern?
[05:56:11] <Cork> elnur: i usually create a namespace and create the function on it
[05:56:18] <elnur> How do I break my code into logical modules?
[05:56:41] <elnur> Cork, do you create a single huge namespace and dump everything there?
[05:56:45] <Cork> you can create additional namespaces if you feel you need to
[05:56:58] <Cork> but over structuring might just add unnessesary work
[05:57:34] <Cork> elnur: i usually do something like window.someName = { namespace1: {}, namespace2: {} }
[05:58:04] <Cork> that way you pollute the global scope as little as possible
[05:58:36] <Cork> though i now days usually load all js in on static go :)
[05:58:45] <elnur> How do you decide to break down a lot of code per namespace?
[05:58:45] <Cork> (ctp forces that)
[05:59:05] <elnur> Yea, I concat and minify everything too.
[05:59:12] <Cork> elnur: i usually devide it by what is needed
[05:59:41] <Cork> opps csp not ctp :x
[05:59:55] <seutje> ur a csp!
[05:59:58] <Cork> elnur: csp stands for Content Security Policy, and it prevents eval, and inline script
[06:00:02] <Cork> ?man csp
[06:00:03] <elnur> But that's kinda another question. It solves the load speed problem. But right now I'm trying to understand how to organize my code better — without caring about load speeds.
[06:00:07] <Cork> ?mdn csp
[06:00:08] <b-ot> Cork: Introducing Content Security Policy - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy
[06:00:35] <Cork> elnur: find a logical structure you find useful and stick to it
[06:00:44] <Cork> over structuring is normally a bad thing
[06:01:02] <Cork> so when it gets crowded move parts into it's own scope
[06:01:12] <Cork> but not before you need to
[06:01:39] <elnur> I have no problems organizing my server side code into layers, packages, classes and methods. But I get lost when it comes to JS.
[06:02:04] <Cork> well start with what the code is meant to do
[06:02:05] <elnur> It's like JS is from another planet.
[06:02:21] <Cork> elnur: it is mostly cause ppl don't care for some reason
[06:02:26] <elnur> Does it even make sense to do classes in JS?
[06:02:30] <Cork> it isn't hard really
[06:02:36] <seutje> Brendan-El
[06:02:38] <Cork> elnur: normally no
[06:02:53] <seutje> (that was a superman joke)
[06:02:54] <Cork> there are cases where it makes a LOT of sense
[06:02:59] <elnur> What about packages, Cork? Is this the (sub)namespace approach?
[06:03:12] <Cork> but wrapping everything into classes is just trying to convert js to another language :)
[06:03:35] <Cork> elnur: packages is mainly namespaces today
[06:03:36] <elnur> Yea, I don't want to bend JS to my habits. I want to understand its idioms and use them.
[06:03:45] <Cork> though js is building in support for modules
[06:03:53] <Cork> but it is going to be a few years before it can be used
[06:03:58] <elnur> ES6?
[06:04:01] <Cork> ya
[06:04:22] <elnur> Hmm. Maybe I should take a look at that.
[06:04:22] <Cork> ?g site:wiki.ecmascript.org module
[06:04:24] <b-ot> Cork: harmony:modules [ES Wiki] - ECMAScript â†’ http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules
[06:04:30] <elnur> And find an open source tool that already does that.
[06:04:40] <Cork> elnur: it isn't supported live by any browsers yet
[06:04:59] <Cork> elnur: there are plenty of tools that do that or similar with namespaces today
[06:05:10] <Cork> requireJS is one of them
[06:05:21] <elnur> Yea, that's what I'm talking about.
[06:06:03] <elnur> I want to understand the principles and find a tool that implements them.
[06:07:12] <elnur> Thanks, Cork, I'll read on modules. You've been very helpful. :)
[06:07:18] <MikeD_> also, how many developers are likely to ever touch this code in 2-5 years?
[06:23:27] <MikeD_> if I have added my UL to the dom, can I use it as the delegation point for li button clicks?
[06:26:56] <Cork> yes
[06:40:54] <MrSavage> Why isn't $(window).load("/"); reloading my client's page to the / page?
[06:41:10] <MrSavage> I'm getting the GET request for / with a status code of 304
[06:43:25] <Cork> MrSavage: window.location = '/';
[06:43:43] <MrSavage> Cork: Why doesn't the load work instead?
[06:43:49] <Cork> you can't load a fragment into window cause window isn't a dom element
[06:43:53] <v0id3d> hey cork how are you going today
[06:44:06] <Cork> v0id3d: fine, friday so... :)
[06:44:16] <v0id3d> haha yea buddy i feel you
[06:44:44] <MrSavage> Cork: What do you mean a fragment?
[06:44:56] <MrSavage> You mean a part of HTML?
[06:45:00] <MrSavage> And what is window?
[06:45:04] <Cork> yes that is what is called a fragment
[06:45:09] <v0id3d> well / is local root on my linux machine
[06:45:12] <Cork> window is the global variable
[06:45:26] <v0id3d> would not point to a website
[06:45:31] <MrSavage> a global variable that is holds what
[06:45:36] <Cork> v0id3d: it will from a website
[06:45:47] <Cork> MrSavage: everything you can do in a page
[06:45:49] <Cork> window.alert
[06:45:58] <Cork> window.eval
[06:45:59] <MrSavage> so it's a collection of functions?
[06:46:13] <Cork> it's the global scope
[06:46:42] <Cork> MrSavage: and there is no command to load a full page into the current page without unloading the old page
[06:47:45] <v0id3d> couldnt you do a php include?
[06:47:58] <Cork> client side? :D
[06:48:20] <v0id3d> oh
[06:48:57] <v0id3d> because u could run the .ajax command to some.php with an include 'whateverpage.php'
[06:49:30] <v0id3d> But i have a question about the .ajax command if you have a moment
[06:50:30] <v0id3d> instead of sending it to somefile.php can i insert <?php ?> >
[06:51:46] <fabioportieri> found a usecase for stopImmediatePropagation() !
[06:54:09] <Cork> v0id3d: i think he wanted to just load a different page
[06:54:16] <v0id3d> oh
[06:54:21] <Cork> and .load isn't meant for that
[06:54:27] <v0id3d> gotcha
[06:54:45] <xMopxShell> hey, does anyone know how to fix   $("ul", scope)  aka  scope.find("ul")   in IE 7 & 8?
[06:55:10] <xMopxShell> That should only return ul's inside of whatever element scope is, but it returns ALL ul's on the page in IE 7&8.
[06:55:46] <Cork> xMopxShell: are you sure scope is the parent element you expect it to be?
[06:55:53] <Cork> cause that shouldn't happen
[06:56:00] <xMopxShell> Positive.
[06:56:07] <xMopxShell> It works as expected in everything except Ie 7 & 8
[06:56:25] <Cork> xMopxShell: and scope.find('ul') works?
[06:56:36] <xMopxShell> no, both of those methods fail the same way
[06:56:39] <Cork> (cause i know that one works, i use it a lot)
[06:56:46] <Cork> then you have something else happening in the page
[06:57:03] <xMopxShell> what else could cause that?
[06:57:05] <Cork> btw what version of jquery are you using?
[06:57:35] <xMopxShell> 1.9.1
[06:57:51] <Cork> inspect what elements you have in the selector
[06:57:55] <Cork> *variables
[06:58:01] <Cork> and that the html is valid
[06:58:09] <Cork> cause other then that it should work
[06:58:29] <Cork> older ie has a crappy dom relation, so you can get circular references
[06:58:42] <Cork> that MIGHT be whats hitting you
[06:58:50] <xMopxShell> If I do scope.css("border", "1px solid #f0f")   the elements i expected are the only one that gets a border
[06:59:13] <Cork> xMopxShell: start with w3c validator
[06:59:22] <Cork> ?g w3c validator
[06:59:23] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service â†’ http://validator.w3.org/
[07:00:14] <xMopxShell> The only validation errors are a few attributes it doesn't like
[07:01:19] <Cork> so scope.find('ul').length == $('ul').length?
[07:01:27] <Cork> i don't have a clue what could cause that
[07:01:34] <xMopxShell> ill test that
[07:01:45] <Cork> never heard of it in a valid html page
[07:05:49] <xMopxShell> oh man
[07:05:51] <xMopxShell> i feel dumb
[07:05:54] <xMopxShell> for(int k=0;k<menuHeads.length;k++) {
[07:05:58] <xMopxShell> dammit, java
[07:07:39] <seutje> s'ok, I often "var" in PHP
[07:15:47] <farn5w0rth> anyone with experience with dataTables and knows how to make ajax calls for pagination?
[07:16:07] <bberry> hey guys, this is a simplified version of what i have.  I cant seem to get promises to work with animate.  Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/qrG7a/
[07:17:38] <seutje> farn5w0rth: http://jsfiddle.net/qrG7a/1/
[07:17:43] <seutje> ups, that was for bberry
[07:17:47] <seutje> surrie!
[07:18:16] <bberry> seutje: you cheater!
[07:18:21] <bberry> :P
[07:18:29] <farn5w0rth> lol
[07:18:33] <seutje> oro?
[07:18:51] <seutje> I've actually used dataTables a year back or so
[07:19:37] <bberry> its weird, in the animate api on jquery they say there's a complete,done,always, etc, as if promises were a property of the animation
[07:19:52] <farn5w0rth> seutje: gunna make a jsfiddle
[07:20:36] <seutje> farn5w0rth: tbh, I think I ended up rewriting half the pipeline stuff in there
[07:20:49] <farn5w0rth> really?
[07:20:58] <bberry> suetje: oooh its AFTER the properties object
[07:21:54] <bberry> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/qrG7a/2/
[07:22:33] <seutje> bberry: ooooh
[07:23:05] <bberry> seutje: or better yet, just accept an in-line function http://jsfiddle.net/qrG7a/3/
[07:23:21] <bberry> (instead of using an object)
[07:23:29] <seutje> bberry: frankly, I though u were trying to avoid that
[07:23:37] <bberry> oh haha, i was just trying to figure it out! :P
[07:23:41] <seutje> otherwise there's no reason not to just use the complete callback
[07:23:56] <bberry> gotcha
[07:24:06] <bberry> yeah didnt know wth i was doing haha
[07:24:49] <xMopxShell> beastmode http://jsfiddle.net/rPZ6s/1/
[07:29:21] <seutje> farn5w0rth: crap, I no longer have access to the project I had to use it in
[07:29:59] <farn5w0rth> seutje: :(
[07:32:31] <str8uplinux> anyone have success with sessionStorage in Chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/maitrekaio/FLvtJ/
[07:49:38] <seutje> farn5w0rth: aha, found it
[07:49:52] <seutje> looks like the main reason I overwrote the pipeline stuff was for caching
[07:50:08] <seutje> the paging was just the default implementation
[07:50:35] <farn5w0rth> seutje: oh damn, yea I'm trying to allow my server to handle the pagination
[08:12:31] <bradix14> I'm trying to turn off jquery's handling of certain <a> links.  Any tips?  What am I looking for?
[08:15:49] <seutje> farn5w0rth: I suggest you look into implementing some caching: http://datatables.net/examples/server_side/pipeline.html
[08:16:37] <farn5w0rth> seutje: thanks - I'm pretty noob to this stuff, what does this allow me to do?
[08:17:03] <seutje> it'll make the application check if the filter criteria were already fetched once
[08:17:18] <seutje> if so, it'll grab them from a local object instead of doing the ajax request again
[08:17:23] <seutje> kinda stupid this isn't the default
[08:18:04] <MadLems> Struggling to get an array or list of the values of all checked checkboxes with same name. trying:: var cats = $("input:checkbox[name=my_checkbox_name]:checked").val();
[08:18:12] <seutje> this implementation invalidates a bit too quickly though, but it still beats the default
[08:18:30] <seutje> MadLems: val() only gives the value for the first element in the collection
[08:18:41] <seutje> probably looking for $.fn.map() or something
[08:18:54] <farn5w0rth> seutje: cool yea that makes sense - I'm going to review this :)
[08:18:59] <seutje> or maybe you want to .serialize() the whole form?
[08:19:23] <MadLems> oh maybe - let me look into serialize!
[08:19:49] <seutje> MadLems: that's mainly usefull for posting the form in its entirety
[08:20:24] <MadLems> gotcha. yeah, i'm effectively serializing this form data, but not in the traditional sense
[08:20:34] <seutje> to make an array of just those checked values: var foo = $("input:checkbox[name=my_checkbox_name]:checked").map(function() {return $(this).val();}).get();
[08:20:37] <MadLems> need to manually format it
[08:20:42] <fabioportieri> can you open jsfiddle with ie9?
[08:20:58] <seutje> fabioportieri: don't see why not
[08:21:10] <fabioportieri> seutje: dunno what's happening here.. :|
[08:21:38] <fabioportieri> maybe i should reboot
[08:22:53] <MadLems> seutje: thanks a lot, that last snippet is working great!
[08:23:29] <MadLems> though i AM quite surprised jQuery doesn't have super simple support for this
[08:23:56] <seutje> map is super simple
[08:25:46] <shoky> and so is serialize and serializeArray
[08:25:59] <shoky> (which can be run on individual elements too)
[09:00:54] <h4k1m> hi guys
[09:02:14] <h4k1m> can anybody give me a jquery plugin that produce the fade-to-white effect I see on this site: http://www.popscreen.com/
[09:03:10] <h4k1m> when we click on filter menu (today, 7 days, 30 days) while loading content is being shown with a whiter taint
[09:03:33] <decx> just change the opacity of the container you ajax to
[09:03:39] <duch_kazatel> yup
[09:03:41] <duch_kazatel> what decx said
[09:04:19] <h4k1m> thanks guys, so by changing the opacity content will have a white taint right?
[09:04:27] <duch_kazatel> LMAO.
[09:04:28] <duch_kazatel> *tint
[09:04:30] <duch_kazatel> not taint.
[09:04:55] <duch_kazatel> and yes, check out rgba color setting <- the "a" is for alpha, which which give you that faded effect.
[09:05:03] <duch_kazatel> you want to animate that.
[09:05:19] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel, how do I animate it?
[09:05:42] <duch_kazatel> really?
[09:05:45] <duch_kazatel> did you google for it?
[09:06:07] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel, no I'm sorry
[09:06:19] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery animate
[09:06:21] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .animate() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ https://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:06:25] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[09:06:56] <h4k1m> thanks duch, I'll have to try it ^^
[09:07:01] <gnarf> !color
[09:07:05] <gnarf> `color
[09:07:08] * gnarf frowns
[09:07:13] <gnarf> why you failing me b-ot
[09:07:18] <duch_kazatel> what do you want it to do?
[09:07:45] <gnarf> you need http://plugins.jquery.com/color/ to animate color values btw h4k1m
[09:07:50] <gnarf> cc duch_kazatel
[09:08:03] <duch_kazatel> gnarf wut.  no you don't.
[09:08:10] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: wat - yes you do
[09:08:15] <h4k1m> I hope I dont
[09:08:16] <duch_kazatel> why?
[09:08:20] <gnarf> unless you're using raw css
[09:08:24] <duch_kazatel> they want to animate a single opacity transition.
[09:08:35] <gnarf> if you are animating via a color, you need jQuery color
[09:08:41] <gnarf> it's not built into the core
[09:09:09] <gnarf> if you are just animating "opacity" then you wont need it
[09:09:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly.
[09:09:19] <duch_kazatel> that's all they're doing.
[09:09:26] <duch_kazatel> they want that fade to white effect.
[09:09:35] <gnarf> jQuery UI Effects Core also includes jQuery Color btw
[09:09:54] <duch_kazatel> meh, i'm personally not a fan of JQUI.
[09:10:40] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: just sayin, if you already have jQuery UI Effects, you have jQuery color
[09:11:16] <duch_kazatel> I tend to prefer the non jqui/plugin route if all they want to do is animate a single color and they aren't all ready using jqui/asked for a plugin.
[09:11:16] <h4k1m> gnarf, you mean if I want to animate a transition from red to blue, I need this plugin
[09:11:41] <duch_kazatel> a plugin would be very helpful for that, h4k1m
[09:11:50] <gnarf> or even from "rgb(255,0,0)" to "rgba(255,0,0,0.1)"
[09:11:59] <gnarf> if you stick to the simple number CSS values, core animate will work
[09:12:07] <gnarf> i.e. opacity / height / width
[09:12:28] <gnarf> but if you animate a property that is a color, jQuery Color is required
[09:12:47] <duch_kazatel> it's not required, but it greatly simplifies things :)
[09:12:57] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: it is required
[09:13:13] <h4k1m> ok thanks gnarf & duch_kazatel I think I'll just have to animate the opacity
[09:14:28] <duch_kazatel> no, it isn't.  color greatly simplifies it, but is not required.
[09:14:59] <h4k1m> so no need to use the plugin unless I need to change the color
[09:15:15] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[09:15:36] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to do color transitions, jquery color makes that beautifully easy, because color values are weird.
[09:16:10] <h4k1m> okey
[09:17:32] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: because without jQuery color, you >can not animate color values< http://jsbin.com/pasaz/1/edit
[09:17:52] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* my entire point is jquery color makes the entire process easier.  jquery color is javascript.
[09:19:07] <jonkristian> Can anyone spot what's wrong with my returned json string? when using jsonlint i get unexpected token... ï»¿--> {"success": true, "modal": true }
[09:19:40] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian are you setting that to a var?
[09:19:52] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: *sigh* my entire point is that if you want to use .animate() to animate a color, you need to include jQuery Color, or write the thing yourself, but that would be silly because I spent a bunch of time doing that for you like 2 years ago
[09:20:08] <gnarf> jonkristian: is that the whole json package?
[09:20:09] <jonkristian> duch_kazatel, no, it is json_encoded array
[09:20:18] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian that's not an array.
[09:20:23] <gnarf> jonkristian: like - php native json_encode?
[09:20:29] <jonkristian> yes
[09:20:35] <gnarf> that shouldn't ever cause jsonlint problems, its very spec specific
[09:21:13] <jonkristian> the returned json looks fine, but i am returning it in ajax response and keep getting undefined for response.modal for instance
[09:21:30] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian can you fiddle your code?
[09:21:38] <jonkristian> I will try that
[09:25:35] <jonkristian> Not sure how to fiddle with ajax but here's a paste: http://pastie.org/8919334
[09:26:54] <jonkristian> Could it be that I have messed with document formatting earlier, UTF-8 / ISO changing around etc. UTF-8 without BOM etc...
[09:27:51] <jonkristian> Some hidden characters, I tried to wash the json, even if i took {"success": true, "modal": true } and pasted into http://jsonlint.com/ I get unexpected token error
[09:27:54] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian that's not complete - can you supply your full javascript file?  it looks like you might be trying to access that var before data gets returned.
[09:28:27] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian copy/pasting that exact line into jsonlint doesn't give me an error.
[09:28:46] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/vzodxuG.png
[09:31:59] <duch_kazatel> gnarf I didn't mean to be a dick earlier - I apologize.
[09:32:29] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: heh - me neither, but I've been dealing with the worst flight in my life the last 24 hours
[09:32:36] <jonkristian> Are you seeing this? ->
[09:32:36] <jonkristian>  I think I found the problem.
[09:32:36] <jonkristian> nope, it didn't show up, but it's a square with four holes in it, some encoding i think.
[09:32:38] <duch_kazatel> aaaah - hah.
[09:32:39] <gnarf> so if i came off dickish, apologies :)
[09:32:49] <duch_kazatel> no big deal mang.
[09:33:02] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian huh?
[09:33:45] <duch_kazatel> ah - encoding problems.
[09:34:49] <jonkristian> http://i.imgur.com/2Ol9KBw.png
[09:34:52] <jonkristian> damn
[09:35:10] <jonkristian> Those where not visible until i pasted some code in here
[09:36:50] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like your problem.  fyi - depending on the environment, javascript only handles UCS-2, not full UTF-8
[09:42:02] <jonkristian> duch_kazatel, could it be that they are sent as well and that's why i can't parse it?
[09:42:16] <duch_kazatel> huh
[09:42:17] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:42:46] <jonkristian> did you see the screenshot?
[09:42:56] <jonkristian> and those squares inside my json response
[09:43:00] <duch_kazatel> yes, i can't understand your question.
[09:43:12] <duch_kazatel> oooh, you mean "are the bad characters also sent"?
[09:43:14] <jonkristian> I can't parse the response, only get undefined
[09:43:15] <dsockwell> Is it ever possible to execute code in JavaScript with or without jQuery during function definition but without calling the function?
[09:43:16] <jonkristian> yes
[09:43:29] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian yes, they are likely being sent over.
[09:43:40] <duch_kazatel> dsockwell huh?
[09:43:50] <jonkristian> I need to try and clean it somehow start with a new document with correct encodings then
[09:44:05] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian do UTF-8 without BOM for everything if that's your style.
[09:44:13] <duch_kazatel> avoid using BOMs at all costs.
[09:44:22] <v0id3d> when i try to activate the noconflict in an external .js is it simply $.noConflict();?
[09:44:35] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d clarify please?
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to enable noconflict for jquery?
[09:45:03] <v0id3d> yes
[09:45:05] <dsockwell> duch_kazatel: can a function(x){abc; xyz;}; statement ever execute abc or xyz if the function is never called?
[09:45:20] <chase> are <select> tags suppose to work inside an <li> element ? I have one appearing, but upon clicking, nothing happens. no dropdown
[09:45:23] <duch_kazatel> dsockwell not that i've seen.
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> chase fiddle some code.
[09:45:55] <chase> duch_kazatel: it's on an internal lan, it might take a few
[09:45:57] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d i would really avoid doing that if you can get away with it.
[09:46:16] <v0id3d> i have to input my code into a wordpress site
[09:46:23] <v0id3d> and wordpress already enables it
[09:46:30] <v0id3d> from what i read at least
[09:46:47] <v0id3d> so i want to write it with it on so i can make sure it all works you know
[09:48:01] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d just wrap your code in this: (function( $ ) {/* your code here */})( jQuery );
[09:48:32] <duch_kazatel> or this: jQuery(function($){ /* Your Code Here */ });
[09:48:56] <v0id3d> wrap all the code in that?
[09:49:10] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:49:13] <v0id3d> like the entire js
[09:49:23] <duch_kazatel> anything that needs to use jquery, sure.
[09:50:09] <v0id3d> well iam keeping the .js files seperated
[09:50:10] <jonkristian> can someone try and paste this into jsonlint? http://pastie.org/8919394
[09:50:12] <v0id3d> thanks a lot
[09:50:19] <jonkristian> I keep getting unexpected token
[09:51:09] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian i'm getting it too.
[09:51:48] <jonkristian> This is the weirdest debugging problem I have ever encountered. And all this on a friday :/
[09:51:51] <v0id3d> hahah duch you win again good sir
[09:51:53] <v0id3d> thank you
[09:52:01] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d of course :)
[09:53:09] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian there's an invisible char at the very beginning of the data
[09:53:21] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/yJ4o4in.png
[09:54:20] <jonkristian> I will try some iconv stuff
[09:54:22] <jonkristian> on the file
[09:57:40] <haemly> Using javascript/jquery, how can I make a button to print a specific div. So when i click it, only the contents of the div will be in the print preview?
[09:57:50] <duch_kazatel> CSS.
[09:57:58] <duch_kazatel> you want to apply print styles to the page.
[09:58:06] <duch_kazatel> or, even smarter, create a print stylesheet.
[10:05:21] <jonkristian> :( still there. \ufeff
[10:09:25] <chase> duch_kazatel: ok here's a fiddle
[10:09:25] <chase> http://jsfiddle.net/XZAqM/
[10:09:41] <chase> it happens once the jquery-sortable plugin is applied to the list
[10:11:07] <tds5016> hi all... I am having an issue where variable assignment are getting overwritten in a for loop. I remember there being some trick with bind; but I don't remember what it was.
[10:11:14] <tds5016> can someone help me figure this out? https://dpaste.de/ez2Z
[10:11:39] <tds5016> https://dpaste.de/ez2Z#L24,25,27,28,29,30
[10:11:44] <tds5016> more speciifically, those lines.
[10:18:52] <NoiseEee> tds5016: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[10:19:14] <haemly> If I am looking for the available height/width a user has for a webpage, do i use the document height? or the window height?
[10:19:41] <tds5016> jeebuz.
[10:19:47] <tds5016> that's REALLY the right way to do it?
[10:20:26] <v0id3d> hey duch_kazatel whats your opinion on jqueryvalidate?
[10:20:52] <v0id3d> is it worth it includeing it or should i just use regex?
[10:22:28] <NoiseEee> tds5016: your issue is that you're only getting the last thing you assigned?
[10:22:57] <tds5016> yeah.
[10:23:02] <NoiseEee> tds5016: thats why
[10:23:07] <tds5016> the solution and info you gave was right...
[10:23:11] <tds5016> but what the eff javascript?
[10:23:20] <NoiseEee> :) closures
[10:23:21] <NoiseEee> good times
[10:23:30] <tds5016> dammit. lol.
[10:23:47] <tds5016> this is one of those times where I'm sorry.... but the language is doin' it wrong.
[10:24:00] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d use client-side validation when appropriate, but always validate server-side :)
[10:24:03] <duch_kazatel> that's my opinion.
[10:24:25] <v0id3d> oh i know about server-side
[10:24:42] <v0id3d> i just looking at client side to keep load down on my server
[10:24:50] <duch_kazatel> let me rephrase - use whatever lib you want.  we've got a hand-rolled one where i'm at.
[10:34:21] <devslash> How do I determine if a checkbox is checked when referencing $(this) ? I tried $(this).prop('checked') but it always returns undefined
[10:35:40] <Jattenalle> devslash, which version of jquery?
[10:35:48] <devslash> latest
[10:35:50] <devslash> 2.1.0
[10:35:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wuT3p/
[10:36:12] <duch_kazatel> becuse the prop doesn't exist until you interact with the checkbox.
[10:36:13] <devslash> that doesnt work
[10:36:26] <duch_kazatel> err, woops.
[10:36:29] <duch_kazatel> out of it today
[10:36:29] <devslash> i put a breakpoint in the event thats triggered when you check the checkbox
[10:36:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wuT3p/1/
[10:36:57] <duch_kazatel> so the prop DOES exist.
[10:37:02] <Jattenalle> yeah i use $('#contentMainmenuSettingsFlare').prop('checked') and it works just fine
[10:37:05] <devslash> what do you mean
[10:37:17] <duch_kazatel> devslash jsfiddle.net/wuT3p/1/
[10:37:19] <Fred77> hi guys!
[10:37:19] <devslash> does it matter if you are using $(this) in the event
[10:37:21] <Jattenalle> are you sure this is a checkbox?
[10:37:26] <devslash> yea
[10:37:32] <Jattenalle> are you really really sure? :P
[10:37:34] <duch_kazatel> devslash share code then?
[10:37:43] <duch_kazatel> because in my example all is well.
[10:37:50] <devslash> lemme see something
[10:40:07] <Fred77> I'm having an issue trying to use .off() in a particular condition
[10:40:21] <Fred77> I prepared a jsbin to show you... http://jsbin.com/rofawuwe/1/edit?js
[10:40:28] <Fred77> I might really use some support
[10:41:09] <Fred77> to problem with my script is that I can't wipe the 'scroll' event from the $(window)
[10:41:22] <duch_kazatel> Fred77 you're not binding anything using on - you're using .one()
[10:41:37] <duch_kazatel> .one() fires the event once and ubinds it for you.
[10:42:05] <Fred77> duch: yup... but under certain condtions i need to unbind it anyway before executing
[10:42:29] <Fred77> does it mean one cannot be unbinded with off?
[10:42:42] <duch_kazatel> i believe one uses on and off under the hood.
[10:43:03] <duch_kazatel> but you should instead only bind when you need it, istead of binding and then trying to unbind if.
[10:43:05] <duch_kazatel> *it
[10:44:11] <Fred77> you have a point... the fact is that most of the time it's easier this way than the other way around
[10:44:24] <duch_kazatel> that doens't make any sense.
[10:44:25] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[10:44:32] <duch_kazatel> *doesn't
[10:44:39] <Fred77> the only condition when I need to stop it before firing again is when I reach a 204 status code
[10:45:09] <duch_kazatel> i'd turn your logic inside out, but that's me.
[10:45:22] <Fred77> I'll look into your bind/unbind idea thanks
[10:45:30] <duch_kazatel> err.
[10:45:35] <duch_kazatel> that's what .on() and .off() do.
[10:45:36] <Fred77> still... there's something weird about the off()  method here
[10:45:37] <duch_kazatel> don't use .bind()
[10:45:59] <duch_kazatel> something tells me .off() might not work with the window scroll event.
[10:46:08] <Fred77> yup... I'm noob at jquery but not that noob ;)
[10:46:18] <duch_kazatel> because you're trying to remove all scroll events.
[10:46:21] <duch_kazatel> *event handlers.
[10:47:51] <Fred77> the weird thing about my issue is that I have used it in different scenarios and it's working beautifully despite all... but I can't make it work in the snippet I sent
[10:48:18] <jonkristian> Quick question. In the inspector in chrome, under response, should there be a red dot infront of the response? like -> dot {"somekey":"someval"}
[10:48:25] <Fred77> ... and it just can't unbind the scroll event :(
[10:48:57] <jonkristian> I am trying to determin if my encoding is adding the red dot or if it's the inspector, when hovering it comes up as \ufeff
[10:50:04] <duch_kazatel> jonkristian no, there shouldn't be a dot.
[10:50:14] <Fred77> duch: I know I'm wiping all the scroll events... I'll fix it passing off() the handler. unfortunately I can't make it work no matter if I add the handler or not
[10:50:50] <jonkristian> duch_kazatel, ok, that's actually good, because then i still have a slight clue about my problem
[10:50:51] <ezrafree> if i have an object of all the checked checkboxes, what's the best way to get all the id attributes into an array?
[10:51:21] <duch_kazatel> Fred77 try using custom event names or namespaces.
[10:51:31] <duch_kazatel> ezrafree have a fiddle?
[10:53:15] <Fred77> duch: i think I solved... it was the most noob issue ever... I should have called it from $(this) instead than $(window)
[10:53:25] <duch_kazatel> Fred77 hah, there you go then.
[10:53:48] <Fred77> duch: damn... I told you I'm quite noob at js/jquery
[10:53:58] <duch_kazatel> we all have stuff like that happen sometimes.
[10:54:21] <Fred77> duch: thanks a lot anyway... I'll take a look at switching the script logic as you suggested though
[10:54:29] <duch_kazatel> that would be your safest bet.
[10:55:32] <duch_kazatel> ezrafree also: you're aware the jquery object is array-like, yeah
[10:55:33] <duch_kazatel> ?
[10:56:51] <ezrafree> duch_kazatel: yeah i can see as much in console but i need an array containing only the id attributes, i think i've almost got it using each() and  push() though, may have troubled you guys a bit prematurely sorry!
[10:57:25] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/HRLJa/1/
[10:57:27] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[11:06:48] <lmao24> why am i getting this all of a sudden when doing ajax request? caution provisional headers are shown
[11:09:15] <duch_kazatel> lmao24 have any extensions installed?  maybe like adblock?
[11:10:30] <lmao24> duch_kazatel, disabled all my addons
[11:10:40] <duch_kazatel> still getting it?
[11:10:44] <lmao24> yeah
[11:10:50] <lmao24> this only started happening today
[11:11:56] <duch_kazatel> sounds like maybe the resource is getting blocked.
[11:12:36] <lmao24> duch_kazatel, is there a way to determin the cause?
[11:12:51] <duch_kazatel> is it cross-domain?
[11:12:57] <lmao24> yeah
[11:13:08] <duch_kazatel> maybe that's the issue?
[11:13:17] <lmao24> let me see, sec
[11:15:41] <lmao24> here's my code
[11:15:42] <lmao24> https://gist.github.com/alexeightsix/e63239ff0c9ebd616c31
[11:16:47] <gnarf> duch_kazatel lmao24 : http://jsfiddle.net/HRLJa/2/ --- check http://api.jquery.com/map and http://api.jquery.com/get
[11:17:02] <duch_kazatel> gnarf that's another way to do it.
[11:17:21] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: a cleaner way ;)
[11:17:24] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[11:18:06] <duch_kazatel> i prefer iterators personally.
[11:18:46] <lmao24> duch_kazatel, did you see my gist? any thing that would prevent the request from loaidng?
[11:19:33] <duch_kazatel> lmao24 nothing jumps out at me.  but that's after a cursory look.
[11:19:42] <puchacz> hi, my server produces something like thi: {"selectedPassage":"blabla\naxxx"}
[11:19:45] <jenia> hello. when i create a dialog, it doesnt have a close button - and x at the top right corner - instead it has a close butotn on top
[11:20:42] <puchacz> shouldn't $.post (.... function(data) {} ) receive this object as json not string?
[11:20:44] <jenia> is that normal default behaviour? and, how can i change that
[11:20:59] <puchacz> jenia: maybe there is a bug? I added a workaround
[11:21:14] <puchacz> jenia:  $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").append("<span class='fa fa-times' style='position:relative; top:-3px'/>");
[11:21:32] <puchacz> jenia: and I have font-awesome installed
[11:21:38] <puchacz> so I have cross in dialogs now
[11:21:55] <jenia> wow. okay thanks. so you're experience this bug too?
[11:22:33] <puchacz> jenia: I was not adding automatic buttons, so don't know about this part, but certainly I did not have a cross
[11:22:50] <jenia> humm okay. thanks a lot
[11:23:00] <puchacz> np
[11:23:23] <Cork> puchacz: $.post returns json if the server sends json
[11:23:40] <Cork> puchacz: if the server sends data in html it won't take it as json
[11:23:42] <puchacz> Cork: what am I to send? something in header?
[11:23:59] <Cork> (meaning check your Content-Type header from the server)
[11:24:08] <puchacz> Cork: thanks
[11:24:21] <Cork> puchacz: the server should send Content-Type: application/json
[11:24:28] <puchacz> will add
[11:24:38] <Cork> if you don't set anything it normally sends Content-Type: text/html
[11:24:46] <Cork> or text/plain
[11:26:09] <puchacz> Cork: it worked, thx
[11:29:56] <GuffyJarvis> Is there a way to write if $(element).css('left') > 40px ?
[11:30:37] <Cork> GuffyJarvis: parseInt($(element).css('left'), 10) > 40
[11:30:50] <GuffyJarvis> thanks Cork
[11:30:58] <Cork> hmm
[11:31:18] <Cork> js> print(parseInt('40px', 10)
[11:31:22] <Cork> opps
[11:31:23] <Cork> js> print(parseInt('40px', 10))
[11:31:27] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[11:31:32] <b-ot> Cork: 40
[11:31:45] <AndyDO> Hello everyone
[11:32:05] <AndyDO> is this a live IRC?
[11:32:33] <spekode> Yes.
[11:33:00] <AndyDO> Awesome, I was wondering how to debug conflicts with jQuery plugins.
[11:33:56] <Cork> AndyDO: what kind of conflict?
[11:34:00] <AndyDO> I have an issue with the page starting at the bottom on load
[11:34:14] <AndyDO> As well as the nav (which should fade in on scroll)
[11:34:22] <AndyDO> not appearing: http://fang.ws
[11:34:44] <Cork> AndyDO: jquery plugins is a very free form of plugins
[11:34:55] <Cork> jquery doens't do any broking between them
[11:35:22] <jenia> is it possible to include the jquery interface to jsfiddle?
[11:35:39] <AndyDO> But the plugins should conflict, because as soon as I remove one the other works
[11:35:40] <Cork> jenia: sure, in framework on the left
[11:36:11] <Cork> AndyDO: you took it the complete opposite of what i meant :)
[11:36:47] <AndyDO> Ah nvm :) just been through 5 hours trying to find the issue here
[11:36:53] <Cork> jquery doesn't provide anything to prevent conflicts, it is quite easy for plugins to conflict if they are doing similar things on the same element
[11:37:05] <jenia> Cork, thanks. I included the jqeury but it seems not to load the interface components.
[11:37:17] <jenia> i have an error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'
[11:37:25] <Cork> jenia: what do you mean by interface? jquery ui?
[11:37:31] <AndyDO> I was thinking something like in Chrome Inspector where I could pinpoint the conflict
[11:37:36] <jenia> yes
[11:37:52] <Cork> jenia: that is a separate lib, and is provided on some of the versions of jquery (in jsfiddle)
[11:38:05] <Cork> (as a checkbox under the dropdown)
[11:38:17] <jenia> thanks
[11:38:41] <Cork> AndyDO: you most likely have to debug the plugins
[11:39:04] <Cork> AndyDO: something like letting the first plugin run, and then check where in the second one it breaks
[11:41:23] <zagaza> hi guys.. I am trying a simple thing on codeacademy.. I try to add a paragraph after <div id="one"></div> by adding $('#one').after('<p>yo</p>');  but it tells me "Oops, try again. It looks like you didn't insert your <p> after the <div> with ID #one"  anyone got a clue why? some kind of bug or is the code actually wrong?
[11:41:48] <decx> that's why i started writing my own stuff, it takes longer initially without a plugin but every new feature or bug isn't running a gauntlet
[11:41:56] <decx> like*
[11:42:20] <Cork> zagaza: that looks about right
[11:42:28] <Cork> (meaning it should work...)
[11:43:01] <Cork> zagaza: http://jsfiddle.net/2pWg3/
[11:43:08] <zagaza> yeah.. I was afraid maybe you cannot target id's in javascript like that but I guess you can?
[11:43:22] <zagaza> cool Cork
[11:43:45] <Cork> zagaza: no that is exactly how you target them
[11:44:05] <zagaza> ok sweet
[11:44:06] <zagaza> thanks
[11:44:08] <decx> i smell a typo
[11:44:23] <Cork> decx: or a bug in the tutorial
[11:44:57] <decx> i would think these first codeacadamy lessons are thouroughly tested
[11:45:13] <decx> thoroughly
[11:45:18] <decx> had to look that one up ^^
[11:46:10] <zagaza> decx: no typo, their markup is             <div id="one">Div #1</div>
[11:46:28] <volk_> hey guys, im doing a put request with $.ajax yet in production its getting made as a GET rquest, any ideas why?
[11:46:49] <Cork> volk_: code?
[11:47:01] <duch_kazatel> volk_ what's the type?  json?  or something else?]
[11:47:29] <Cork> duch_kazatel: "a put request"
[11:47:56] <duch_kazatel> sorry, typo there - but sometimes people try to run "put" with jsonp.
[11:48:00] <duch_kazatel> i have seen it before.
[11:48:13] <drej> so who's excited about jqueryTO ?
[11:48:30] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i suspect this is in the same server though
[11:48:55] <Cork> though i wanted the entire $.ajax call before commenting on it
[11:48:55] <duch_kazatel> you cannot put with jsonp is my point.
[11:49:06] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, seeing the code might be helpful.
[11:49:09] <Cork> ya, but it can be a long list of other things too
[11:49:12] <decx> zagaza did you put document ready in script.js? i am checking the codeacademy lesson right now and it works. (modifying html elements 3/14)
[11:49:13] <volk_> 'sorry i'll paste it in a second
[11:49:16] <volk_> let me set it up
[11:49:30] <Cork> volk_: a simple pastebin shoudl work for this
[11:49:35] <volk_> yep
[11:49:39] <drej> but if you do it in jsfiddle
[11:49:41] <drej> we can see the results
[11:49:53] <Cork> drej: not from ajax
[11:50:00] <drej> what?
[11:50:08] <volk_> http://pastebin.com/EHAUx4Ad
[11:50:12] <Cork> drej: the problem is an ajax call
[11:50:13] <duch_kazatel> pastebin always makes reading code harder.
[11:50:25] <volk_> i can't do it in fiddle unfortunately cause the server im hitting is internal
[11:50:25] <duch_kazatel> oh coffeescript.
[11:50:33] <Cork> ugg
[11:50:35] <drej> http://echo.jsontest.com/
[11:50:36] <drej> ?
[11:50:37] <Cork> i thought so
[11:50:49] <Cork> i felt the smell of rails :)
[11:50:53] <volk_> hahaha
[11:50:56] <decx> so i'm not the only one confused by coffee
[11:50:56] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:50:57] <volk_> you are correct senator
[11:51:15] <decx> writing all those { isnt that hard
[11:51:20] <Cork> volk_: you should not set contentType: 'application/json'
[11:51:36] <Cork> volk_: you should set dataType:'json' though
[11:51:39] <volk_> well sorry, this is my revised code i should say
[11:51:43] <volk_> this is what i had before Cork
[11:51:45] <volk_> that also didnt work
[11:51:47] <volk_> one sec
[11:51:59] <Cork> volk_: dataType 'json' is important
[11:52:04] <Cork> unless you have .json in the url
[11:52:16] <volk_> http://pastebin.com/QQf76T5b
[11:52:17] <Cork> cause then rails won't know what type of data you want
[11:52:39] <Cork> method: 'PUT' => type: 'put'
[11:52:59] <Cork> method is for forms, not $.ajax :)
[11:53:03] <volk_> shit
[11:53:05] <volk_> really
[11:53:29] <volk_> oh god it is type
[11:53:30] <volk_> haha
[11:53:36] <volk_> i think that might be the issue..
[11:54:11] <volk_> Cork: so to clarify contentType vs dataType, i thought that dataType is what you expect the server to return and contentType is what youre sending
[11:54:22] <volk_> but im not expecting anything from the server
[11:54:26] <volk_> once i make a PUT
[11:55:11] <Cork> volk_: true
[11:55:34] <slindberg> when creating a keyboard event with jQuery.Event and one of either 'keyCode' or 'which' is set, shouldn't the other value be populated as part of 'normalizing' the event? http://jsbin.com/siyicuwo/1/
[11:55:36] <Cork> volk_: i just assumed you wanted json back
[11:55:41] <Cork> volk_: but you might want both
[11:55:53] <volk_> ah okay, yeah maybe i'll just leave it out and let it infer by itself
[11:56:27] <Cork> volk_: if you cant contentType you need to JSON.stringify the data part
[11:56:34] <Cork> cant==want
[11:56:54] <Cork> cause jquery will always convert objects to params
[11:56:56] <Cork> not json
[11:57:27] <Cork> volk_: though for simple queries like what you have there params is shorter
[11:57:33] <volk_> okay so to reiterate, if i do set contentType to 'application/json' then i need to stringify, otherwise just leave it as an object
[11:57:36] <Cork> so you might want to keep it as that
[11:57:47] <Cork> yes
[11:58:19] <volk_> cool that makes sense
[11:58:21] <Cork> { contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify(data) }
[11:59:05] <volk_> thanks sir
[11:59:12] <Cork> volk_: i usually leave the default as params, and send json to a variable if i want to send it
[11:59:22] <Cork> volk_: rails will parse the json to hash
[11:59:36] <Cork> so contentType isn't really ever needed
[11:59:50] <Cork> { data: { json: JSON.stringify(data) } }
[11:59:54] <volk_> ah i see
[12:00:22] <Cork> or as an example { data: { q: query, filters: JSON.stringify(filters) } }
[12:00:56] <volk_> interesting
[12:01:07] <Cork> the nice part about that is that it works for get calls too :)
[12:01:23] <Cork> or... damn
[12:01:28] <Cork> i'm not sure about the last part
[12:01:51] <Cork> might be get didn't do it; or it was fixed in 4.0/4.1
[12:01:57] <Cork> don't remember >_<
[12:03:05] <volk_> im more of an angular guy :) making these requests
[12:03:07] <volk_> is a lot easier
[12:03:13] <volk_> over yonder
[12:04:49] <Cork> decx: to answer your question, i'm not confused by it, i just really dislike it
[12:04:58] <Cork> decx: and i find it completely useless
[12:05:35] <decx> huh
[12:05:39] <decx> oh coffee
[12:05:42] <Cork> ya
[12:06:06] <decx> yeah i just don'T get it, i must assume it's more natural for people coming from a specific language
[12:06:42] <Cork> decx: that is the problem i have with it ya, it doesn't really add anything, so why use it
[12:07:10] <duch_kazatel> coffeescript is very ruby-ish
[12:07:12] <duch_kazatel> imo
[12:07:20] <EnlightenMental> creating a jsfiddle for a question.. I have a fixed nav, with to slideToggle items.. I need to adjust the padding of a container based on which slideToggle items are opened
[12:07:29] <EnlightenMental> very tough to explain.. :/
[12:07:45] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you might be right
[12:08:33] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i'm actually a bit surprised they have't gone for ruby compiled to js instead >_>
[12:08:50] <Cork> or even a ruby interpreter written in js (yes there exist one)
[12:08:58] <Cork> *there is one
[12:09:54] <duch_kazatel> that is godawful.  and i'm sure there's a ruby -> compiler.
[12:10:08] <Cork> i'm sure
[12:10:12] <Cork> haven't checked though
[12:10:40] <Cork> though ruby does so much meta programing, that it can't be compiled
[12:11:26] <duch_kazatel> http://opalrb.org/
[12:11:30] <duch_kazatel> python is the same way.
[12:11:42] <Cork> ruby most be about the strangest language i know
[12:11:42] <duch_kazatel> and there's a python compiler for javascript.
[12:12:16] <Cork> duch_kazatel: python is saner when it comes to this
[12:13:06] <Cork> i remember what mind job method_missing? was when i started using ruby
[12:13:32] <Cork> "wait, i can call a method that doesn't exist"
[12:13:39] <Cork> "and cause i called it is now created?!?"
[12:13:48] <Cork> "WTF"
[12:13:49] <Cork> XD
[12:13:59] <MikeD_> using .autocomplete(), how can i refer to the DOM element that is being autocompleted inside the source: function() ?
[12:14:13] <EnlightenMental> drej, you have a second?
[12:14:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah ruby is... gross.
[12:14:33] <Cork> MikeD_: are you talking about the input field?
[12:14:35] <jenia> i;m despairing. for some reason jquery ui doenst work for me: when i create a dialog, instead of seeing this:http://jsfiddle.net/5YKLt/
[12:14:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ya
[12:15:04] <jenia> i see basically close (underlined) and some text appear on the middle of the screen
[12:15:16] <jenia> no nice dialog. what in the world am i doing wrong?
[12:15:44] <Cork> jenia: sounds like you don't have the css loaded
[12:16:07] <jenia> ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. lol okay thanks a lot
[12:16:13] <jenia> i didnt know what to do at one point lol
[12:16:42] <Cork> jenia: http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[12:16:48] <Cork> check the "theme" section there
[12:16:54] <Cork> or use the themeroller on jqueryui.com
[12:18:55] <v0id3d> how can i clear a <div> in jQuery? like if i wanted to make <div id="errorMessages"> </div> clear out?
[12:19:11] <Cork> ?api empty
[12:19:11] <b-ot> Cork: .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[12:19:17] <v0id3d> thanks
[12:19:18] <Cork> :)
[12:19:21] <v0id3d> hahaha
[12:19:24] <v0id3d> ?api
[12:19:25] <b-ot> v0id3d: ~afeijo
[12:19:46] <v0id3d> thought i would get a list
[12:19:47] <v0id3d> haha
[12:20:06] <Cork> v0id3d: just go to api.jquery.com
[12:20:13] <Cork> irc isn't good at listing things
[12:20:17] <v0id3d> hahaha ?dur
[12:20:33] <Cork> or rather it isn't a good medium for listing things
[12:34:46] <Neobenedict> is it possible I can make $('input[name=image]') work for both name=image and name=image[] somehow?
[12:37:22] <NoiseEee> Neobenedict:  $('input[name^=image]')
[12:38:20] <Neobenedict> how does that work, NoiseEee?
[12:38:32] <Neobenedict> with ^ after name
[12:39:10] <decx> read up on it here: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[12:39:37] <Cork> Neobenedict: it is regex like attribute selector
[12:39:54] <Cork> it is a strandard css feature
[12:40:22] <MikeD_> Cork:  yes (sorry, was in meeting)  the I attached the autocomplete via .find('input.entry') and I want an attribute value from the one the user is interacting with
[12:41:56] <Cork> MikeD_: the first argument to the function should be the search term
[12:42:04] <Cork> MikeD_: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[12:45:31] <MikeD_> function( request, response ){ alert(JSON.stringify( request ) }   alerts {term: "foo"}   i'm trying to get to the input element's attributes
[12:46:10] <Cork> what attribute?
[12:47:22] <MikeD_> data-has
[12:47:32] <MikeD_> i know, that looks like nonsense
[12:48:49] <Cork> $(this).data('has')
[12:48:53] <Cork> should work
[12:49:37] <Cork> though i have to admit i've never tried it :)
[12:50:52] <fiveofoh> Yeah, data() will pull data attributes
[12:50:55] <fiveofoh> It just won't update them
[12:51:10] <fiveofoh> (in the DOM, it stores them separately)
[12:51:17] <MikeD_> the problem is $(this) doesn't appear to be referencing the input
[12:51:41] <fiveofoh> MikeD_: Well where is that function()?  Seems to be...in an AJAX call of some sort?
[12:51:45] <Cork> MikeD_: was afraid of that
[12:51:56] <Cork> fiveofoh: it is autocomplete
[12:51:58] * fiveofoh reads more context
[12:54:02] <fiveofoh> MikeD_: Does $(this).autocomplete('widget') get you anything useful?  I'm not totally clear from the docs what that grabs
[12:54:47] <fiveofoh> Hmm, that seems like it'll grab the menu box created by autocomplete, not the thing itself
[12:54:53] <Cork> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/VCLY4/
[12:55:00] <Cork> this.element is what you want
[12:56:00] <Cork> fiveofoh: ya widget is normally the wrappings the plugin adds not the original element
[12:56:20] <fiveofoh> Heh, was just setting up a fiddle to poke at it myself :)
[12:56:43] <Cork> fiveofoh: i've fiddled with it before, didn't remember it though
[13:23:00] <c4ptnh00k113> howdy all
[13:25:57] <nmz787> anyone here use blueimp jquer-fule-uploader?
[13:26:08] <nmz787> jquery-file-uploader
[13:26:47] <nmz787> I can't figure out how to change the client's expected JSON response after an upload completes
[13:27:17] <c4ptnh00k113> I use it
[13:27:37] <c4ptnh00k113> I hate that I have to though. I emplimented it in an mvc approach
[13:27:48] <c4ptnh00k113> asp.net mvc that is
[13:29:21] <pringlescan> I'd like feedback on this writeup of parametric polymorphism/parameter swizzling and the merits of jQuery and similar libraries: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dK5e7H3d1gZRTC3TWcfA9PrwcHHlFfRcRE9ZpyG8-mg/edit#heading=h.ea6avwu0lern
[13:30:22] <nmz787> c4ptnh00k113: it beats flash, I just wish the author would be a bit more helpful with simple questions (which result from the lacking-for-me docs)
[13:30:58] <nmz787> he likes to respond to questions with unrelated answers, rather than giving me a file and line number to go look up
[13:31:18] <ankurk_> nmz787: wouldn't the JSON response be changed on server side/
[13:32:39] <nmz787> ankurk_: except I don't oown youtube
[13:32:52] <ankurk_> ahhh, youtube
[13:33:24] <ankurk_> you might wanna do something to manipulate JSON then
[13:33:29] <nmz787> hmm
[13:34:06] <nmz787> so i'd have to attached some function to the jqxhr success callback?
[13:34:29] <ankurk_> Actually do it on complete, since you want the upload to finish
[13:34:39] <ankurk_> that's my guess though
[13:35:26] <nmz787> heh, in complete is where i'm removing the error message that has already been rendered
[13:35:31] <nmz787> so I think that's too late
[13:35:44] <nmz787> well fileuploadcomplete
[13:36:02] <nmz787> ankurk_: is that what you meant, or is complete a jqXHR thing?
[13:36:39] <c4ptnh00k113> agreed. but if you are trying to poll the status of a video uploaded to youtube you should be using the api given to you from youtube
[13:37:55] <c4ptnh00k113> I am also assuming a lot here so forgive me if I was mistaken on the reason you are using blue imp in the first place
[13:38:22] <nmz787> c4ptnh00k113: well i am using the response to determine whether or not to remove the uploader-generated error (because the response didn't have the name, size, thumbnailurl and url keys)
[13:38:35] <nmz787> i think i need to     .success(function (result, textStatus, jqXHR) {/* ... */})
[13:38:36] <ankurk_> nmz787: here's something that might help you, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5240876/difference-between-success-and-complete
[13:38:49] <nmz787> in the fileuploadsend callback
[13:39:43] <ankurk_> in other news, I wrote HTML for an Email.
[13:39:45] <EnlightenMental> is it possible to get the value of all selectors with using .each() ?    $('a').data('type');
[13:40:27] <c4ptnh00k113> hmm I'm sorry I dont know on that one. only thing I would do is begin by figuring out what information is being returned and try to extrapolate from there
[13:40:34] <ankurk_> EnlightenMental: only if all selectors have same classname
[13:41:27] <c4ptnh00k113> what ankurk said. you can not iterate based on the element merely having a class if that is what you are asking
[13:41:56] <ankurk_> c4ptnh00k113: means?
[13:42:21] <c4ptnh00k113> means i was agreeing with you and then adding information
[13:42:22] <ankurk_> I thought you can iterate over the elements having same class name
[13:42:26] <ankurk_> oh
[13:42:33] <c4ptnh00k113> yes based on a class name
[13:42:52] <c4ptnh00k113> but i can not iterate all elements that have any class
[13:43:01] <c4ptnh00k113> I must specify the classname
[13:43:13] <ankurk_> yep, but condition is classnames should be same
[13:43:20] <c4ptnh00k113> exactly
[13:44:01] <ankurk_> or Element type should be same
[13:45:11] <c4ptnh00k113> yes .each() is a function that iterates through a collection. If there is no common properties among the elements there can be no collection
[13:45:19] <c4ptnh00k113> are no*
[13:45:47] <ankurk_> yep true
[13:46:09] <ankurk_> *me thinks* I should participate here more often
[13:48:59] <c4ptnh00k113> I used to be on more often but as my project load increases at work I am unable to contribute as much
[13:58:34] <Neobenedict> hi folks, I have this code http://privatepaste.com/ce1f2360d7 , this is globally placed on all pages and works fine, but I want name="image[]" to work as well as name="image", how can I add it?
[13:58:50] <Neobenedict> since one of the text input's name is image[]
[14:00:48] <ankurk_> c4ptnh00k113: same here, since I am interning I don't get much time
[14:01:18] <ankurk_> Neobenedict: you might change your names
[14:01:21] <ankurk_> *wanna
[14:03:15] <c4ptnh00k113> Neobenedict: you can try escaping the characters
[14:03:38] <c4ptnh00k113> but IT would be much better practice to not use special characters in your element name
[14:04:38] <c4ptnh00k113> Neobenedict: refer to http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/    please
[14:06:14] <Neobenedict> Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"] c4ptnh00k113?
[14:06:30] <Neobenedict> also, I can't change the element names in this case.
[14:08:04] <c4ptnh00k113> more like name*="name" that would give you all elements where the name contains the string "name"
[14:08:17] <Neobenedict> yeah but I just want image and image[]
[14:08:20] <Neobenedict> only two I need
[14:09:25] <c4ptnh00k113> then yes name^="name" would be appropriate
[14:10:09] <Neobenedict> do I need quotes? name=image works at the moment
[14:10:13] <Neobenedict> so name^=image
[14:10:57] <c4ptnh00k113> just a best practice thing I do so that the string is recognized as such for readability
[14:11:17] <c4ptnh00k113> you should always quote strings
[14:12:06] <neataroni> is there a way i can use trackpad gestures (like from a macbook)? i want to use left and right two finger swipes
[14:13:20] <c4ptnh00k113> i believe jquery mobile has a method for that.... but other than that I am not sure
[14:34:41] <gnarf> Neobenedict: quotes are techincally required there
[14:35:07] <gnarf> attribute equals/etc selectors require quotes by spec, but are sometimes loose for things that are "barewords" in css
[14:35:21] <gnarf> i.e. "image" "name" "enabled" "disabled" don't need to be quoted
[14:35:41] <gnarf> but that is such an obscure bit of knowledge, its easier to remember and practice "always quote"
[14:35:59] <m1chael> i have a <ul.. jquery autocomplete within a form. the field is not being POSTed, what can i do?
[14:38:02] <c4ptnh00k113> the first step is to determine what is actually happening? is the autocomplete function being called?
[14:38:38] <m1chael> the auto complete is fine. the server never receieves the field/value
[14:39:22] <c4ptnh00k113> can you give me a paste bin or something
[14:40:21] <m1chael> http://infobuzz.me/static/test/
[14:40:52] <m1chael> when you hit Submit, there is a full report... the autocomplete field is never being POSTed
[14:43:01] <m1chael> the autocomplete field is a <ul>.. i don't know how that would work with a Form
[14:44:38] <Neobenedict> nice, thanks gnarf
[14:44:46] <Neobenedict> you too c4ptnh00k113, thanks.
[14:45:07] <c4ptnh00k113> Without seeing the source I can only assume we are having a problem with form serialization or that the value selected from your list is not being saved as the value of the input element
[14:45:15] <c4ptnh00k113> No problem Neobenedict
[14:47:58] <c4ptnh00k113> if it is form serialization you would be able to see the problem in the return headers from the server
[14:49:10] <m1chael> i can see the server is not getting the value
[14:51:10] <c4ptnh00k113> im debuggin now
[14:55:44] <c4ptnh00k113> yeah so can you set up a jsfiddle with this?
[15:42:15] <motaka2> hello why prevent default doesnt work on this page when I click on "submit" ?
[15:44:01] <duch_kazatel> what's your javascript look like?
[15:45:02] <Valesk> Hey, I'm filtering products by a checkbox with my existing script. However, I'm adding a few checkboxes and need to narrow down the search by checking each box.. which filters it further. For instance, if I had vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free.. if I checked gluten-free and vegan it would ONLY show the products that are gluten-free AND vegan. Rather than showing me all vegan products and gluten free products at once.
[15:45:04] <Valesk> Here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mzvNL/1/
[15:47:54] <Valesk> Any ideas?
[15:51:57] <matcouto> Hey guys, I was wondering, how can I get a custom data attribute(data-foo="bar") of an span child using something like this $("#sup_span").children("span").each(function(){ // here I would get the data-foo attribute value which would be 'bar' }    ?
[15:53:12] <donmatthew> matcouto: $("#id").attr('foo-bar')
[15:56:08] <matcouto> donmatthew why foo-bar ?
[15:56:52] <matcouto> donmatthew this is a static example, the data-type value will be dynamic
[16:07:04] <diphtherial> hey, not entirely sure if this is the right place to ask, but i'm looking for a widget for choosing a time interval
[16:07:23] <JackBauer24> matcouto: .data("foo")
[16:07:27] <diphtherial> preferably a slider with two handles on it where you can drag the center of the interval to offset it
[16:07:41] <diphtherial> and with tick marks labeled by time
[16:09:31] <matcouto> JackBauer24 inside the loop?
[16:11:14] <JackBauer24> matcouto: inside of the loop just call $(this).data("foo") if you want to get attribute "data-foo" of the current element in iteration
[16:22:27] * matcouto JackBauer24  hit the nail on the head!!! 
[16:22:28] <matcouto> cheers
[16:47:30] <cp> question about chaining ajax loads - i've been experimenting with a solution i found on stack overflow - difference is i want to trigger an action when all the loads complete and their success/failure functions are triggered. http://jsfiddle.net/8H2Rb/ - i managed to do it by using the size of the array and a counter but it feels like there must be a more elegant solution.
[17:34:29] <m1chael> i'm completely confused. why would jquery mobile's autocomplete be using a <ul.. instead of an <input type="text".... ??? i've got autocomplete working perfectly except it doesn't POST anything in the form because it's a <ul.... ????
[17:38:48] <drej> question
[17:38:55] <drej> has anyone come out yet and admitted to jquery mobile being garbage?
[17:39:17] <drej> or is everyone still kind of not talking about it? like my uncle steve who has an "inner ear infection" at every family gathering
[17:42:24] <decx> i don't think it's garbage. but the jquery in the name is a misnomer as it's not really anything like jquery and much more like a multipurpose baseline design&functionality framework like bootstrap
[17:43:17] <decx> not a fan either way
[17:44:03] <drej> i mean its like bootstrap, if bootstrap took all your markup, then replaced it all in the dom, added 10x more elements and then threw them into a blender
[17:44:21] <drej> anyway , im mad and i wont take it any more!
[17:44:24] <drej> down with this sort of thing!
[17:44:28] * drej 's hyper, please ignore
[17:44:39] <decx> bootstrap with handlebars AND angular at the same time
[17:45:36] <decx> i only ever see its markup when somebody asks about it here, but it's something alright
[17:46:20] <m1chael> just the fact that jquery mobile's autocomplete thing uses a <ul.... i dont know. it just makes my head spin. why on earth would someone approve that? and even more baffling.. no one else is having this problem!?
[17:46:38] <m1chael> should i seriously not be using jquery mobile?
[17:46:39] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to access the "families" variable outside of the scope of that extension call... How? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9560064
[17:49:59] <decx> what do you mean, either define the var in in a higher(lower? parent...) scope or attach it as data onto something
[17:50:32] <decx> oh it is, i didnt scroll :D
[17:50:36] <m1chael> drej: what's better to use?
[17:51:23] <decx> have you logged families? maybe it's not what you think it is
[17:52:26] <LinksEz> How do you check what a css item is set to in js/jquery?
[17:53:01] <decx> if you use .css it's attached as an inline style
[17:53:17] <decx> css('width') will give you that
[17:54:05] <LinksEz> hmm.
[17:54:58] <LinksEz> I see.
[17:55:09] <LinksEz> Doesn't work with multi input things?
[17:55:20] <LinksEz> Border/outline/margin
[17:55:44] <decx> yes put them in an array
[17:55:57] <decx> css(['border','width',...])
[17:56:13] <decx> it'll return an object with your stuff
[17:56:21] <LinksEz> Thankyou. <3
[17:57:21] <drej> m1chael: for what? imean tons of frameworks have mobile-specific styles and layout structures
[17:57:33] <drej> as for the behaviour, most of it is outdated anyway, and easier to do without it being imposed on you
[17:57:39] <drej> www.topcoat.io
[17:57:45] <drej> www.purecss.io
[17:57:48] <drej> those are both great for mobile
[17:59:33] <checkit> How can I pass my families variable to the second done function : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9560206
[17:59:56] <lombrozo> Can anyone please tell my why my simple javascript/jquery animation is so choppy/unresponsive on my nexus 7?  http://conjugator.cdudigital.com/student/map
[18:40:51] <bobdobbs`> hey guys: I had an animation issue that I solved by using a $.(animatedEl).promise().done(f)
[18:41:16] <bobdobbs`> but then I discovered that IE doesn't support javascript promises
[18:41:40] <bobdobbs`> Are jquerys promises js promises underneath?
[18:42:15] <bobdobbs`> I haven't fired up my vm yet, for testing my animation. Just thought I'd ask if it was even worth testing.
[18:52:14] <bobdobbs`> So, while I'm trying to work this out, I'm looking at the source code for the version of jq I'll be using. v1.10.2. iiuc, this version should work fine on IE8, 9, 10. But I can see the string 'promise' throughout the source.
[18:52:47] <bobdobbs`> In this case, is jq working with it's own definition of 'promise'? Or does it have it's own seperate thing?
[18:57:18] <m1chael> how do i make jquery mobile autocomplete in a text input and not a <ul> ?
[18:58:06] <m1chael> this is insane. why would it be a <ul? no one else has a problem with this?
[19:02:51] <drej> m1chael: what problem are you having exactly?
[19:03:06] <drej> what it does is it replaces the input with an LI visually so that it can be styled easily;
[19:03:11] <drej> however the original input still exists
[19:03:18] <drej> so when the form is submitted, that input's value is submitted
[19:03:23] <drej> it does that for you, so what problem are you having exactly ?
[19:07:19] <m1chael> drej, i'll put my code up.. one sec
[19:07:58] <m1chael> http://infobuzz.me/add-sighting/ # if you hit Submit, and when you see the error report.. it shows that no Post data for the autocomplete field has been submitted
[19:08:53] <drej> i saw it get submitted?
[19:08:56] <drej> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Temporarily Unavailable) http://infobuzz.me/json/celebrity/?q=anything
[19:09:08] <drej> although got a 503; it submitted "anything" that was my string
[19:09:26] <m1chael> i was gracefully restarting apache. try again
[19:09:50] <m1chael> when you hit submit, and see the django error report.... the POST data shows no autocomplete data was submitted via POST
[19:10:33] <m1chael> im not having a problem with the auto complete
[19:10:45] <m1chael> i'm having a problem when the user hits submit... the autocompelte field is not POSTed
[19:10:51] <m1chael> because it's a stupid <ul
[19:10:53] <drej> no i know
[19:10:59] <drej> its not the ul thats the problem
[19:11:03] <m1chael> oh
[19:11:05] <drej> its visually a ul
[19:11:15] <drej> there's still an <input> there
[19:11:29] <m1chael> when a do a check in chrome dev tools, i see another <form in there, and an <input etc..
[19:11:39] <m1chael> but i'm still not seeing the POST data
[19:11:55] <drej> yup when you fill it in, it should be populating those inputs that are visually hidden
[19:11:57] <drej> but get submitted
[19:12:04] <drej> but shh for like 2 minutes lol
[19:12:07] <m1chael> ok lol
[19:12:10] <drej> while i look into it
[19:13:27] <drej> i think its because its a nested form
[19:13:30] <drej> its not submitting the right thing
[19:13:35] <drej> for some reason you have a form inside a form
[19:13:38] <m1chael> right, the nested form is caused by jquery mobile
[19:13:42] <axilaris> anyone knows how to add a new item in select listbox on load (document ready ?)
[19:14:11] <axilaris> to an existing select list
[19:14:18] <drej> i think thats because it was intended to be submitted as an xhr post
[19:14:21] <drej> not a real post @ m1chael
[19:14:32] <drej> sorry, i actually hate jquery for this reason, but that's sort of the direction to look into
[19:14:38] <drej> err jquery mobile
[19:14:39] <drej> MOBILE
[19:14:40] * drej ducks
[19:14:42] <drej> settle down people
[19:14:43] <drej> sheesh
[19:14:57] <m1chael> xhr post?
[19:15:11] <axilaris> hmm maybe append.. $("#theSelectId").append("<option value='' selected='selected'></option>");
[19:15:15] <m1chael> i've been on the internet for a long time, and i've never seen such weirdness
[19:15:25] <drej> yeah as in not an actual form submit, but an "ajax" submit
[19:15:43] <drej> where it would serialize the values of the inputs in that nested form and then submit that in an ajax post
[19:15:55] <drej> and so the structure of the form for a 'traditional' post is screwed as a resul
[19:15:56] <drej> t
[19:16:01] <m1chael> ah
[19:16:19] <m1chael> someone i think tried to explain that to me earlier in a cocky way and it flew way over my head
[19:16:35] <drej> so maybe just try using the built in function or callback or whatever it is to submit that autocomplete value
[19:19:30] <m1chael> drej, i really appreciate you looking at this for me
[19:19:51] <drej> no problem, id look deeper but im a little sidetracked and have quite an eversion to jquery mobile in general
[19:19:59] <drej> aversion *
[19:20:05] <m1chael> at this point i've got that same aversion.
[19:20:32] <axilaris> anyone has a simple nice modal window example ?
[19:20:38] <m1chael> the rest of my software stack is A+... this jquery mobile stuff is a C- at best
[19:21:36] <drej> m1chael: im building an angularjs phonegap mobile-specific app myself
[19:21:51] <drej> so i have a ton of experience with mobile-specific dev; but i write it all from scratch
[19:22:00] <ManyouRisms> is it cool to idle in this channel?
[19:22:13] <drej> ManyouRisms: yeah but you have to buy everyone a round of beers after a week
[19:22:27] <ManyouRisms> that isn't so bad.
[19:22:41] <ManyouRisms> at least it's not aged scotch.. or something
[19:22:51] <m1chael> 696 drinks per week would really add up!
[19:24:01] <drej> m1chael: well everyone does it just once
[19:24:11] <drej> as an initiation after the first week
[19:24:11] <drej> :)
[19:24:19] <m1chael> hehe
[19:24:46] <ManyouRisms> hi Sevn
[19:25:07] <Sevn> hey bra

[19:28:32] <cannap> there 1000 plugins for this
[19:41:03] <ManyouRisms> what is everyones favourite feature of jquery
[19:41:09] <ManyouRisms> over javascript. accessing the DOM?
[19:41:51] <drej> the spelling
[19:43:37] <ManyouRisms> the spelling, eh?
[19:44:08] <drej> i mean its at least 4 letters less
[19:44:10] <drej> maybe more
[19:44:46] <ManyouRisms> is jQ a recognized representation?
[19:44:50] <ManyouRisms> if not, it should be.
[19:48:23] <drej> so jQueryTO is tomorrow
[19:48:31] <drej> who else is excited / going to be there?
[19:55:59] <m1chael> i would go if it was logistically easier. i'm in connecticut
[19:59:09] <drej> m1chael: i just drove to hartford last weekend from toronto
[19:59:11] <drej> for a wedding
[20:14:16] <soahccc> Is there an somewhat cross browser way to warn users when the leave the upload page while a file is being uploaded? I fiddled with unbeforeunload a while now and I can't get it to work in chrome or firefox. in chrome window.unbeforeunload is undefined even though I tried to set it in various way (setting it in the console directly works). Firefox does show the function but won't do a thing on page change
[20:17:42] <araujo> is it possible to bind an event handler to an element that is added in runtime?
[20:18:40] <araujo> more specifically, I want to bind .click() in an element that is added later after some operations in the page.. but doesn't seem to work
[20:25:29] <neataroni> does anyone know a library for handling trackpad gestures like two finger swipes?
