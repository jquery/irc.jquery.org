[00:03:03] <aaron1245> Using jQuery mobile, is it possible to pull in an external page that uses it's own set of css/images/js?  Someone at work is giving me a folder that has one index.html file and images/js/css inside their own folders.  Is this possible to load into JQM?
[00:16:16] <doev> hi. I need to use jquery/jqueryui on a site that already uses the scripts, but the scripts are badly used and I can't be sure what the designer did. Can I use my own version and prefix it? I don't want to run into conflicts with the other stiff.
[00:16:17] <fattest> I have a jquery timeline that gets data off twitter newsfeed...however, I want to use it to add my own details and list. Is it possible to add timeline information through html not javascript. Please help, i've been working on it for ages and still can't figure it out! http://jsfiddle.net/BN494/
[00:21:49] <a_fejer> @doev: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[00:22:48] <Cork> doev: though be warned you are in for a hell of a time if you run more then one jquery version on the same site
[00:22:53] <Cork> it really doesn't work well
[00:23:09] <Cork> plugins will break depending on where they are, so forth
[00:23:35] <Cork> and worst of all; load time takes a hard hit as you need to load double the amount of framework script
[00:24:24] <doev> yes, I see
[00:24:50] <Cork> so ya, cleaning up the site is by far the safest bet
[00:25:08] <Cork> noConflict is mainly to allow you to use other frameworks
[00:25:19] <Cork> it can be used to jquery + jquery
[00:25:43] <Cork> but isn't as good there as there will still be things you need to carefully craft to get it to work
[00:25:52] <a_fejer> it's quite annoying with Adobe's CQ (or now known as Web Experience Manager). it loads it's one (older) version of jQuery, but the frontend devs want to use the newest version of jQuery for their fancy jQuery plugins.
[00:25:58] <doev> I have to do a search on used js-scripts. badly half off the content is stored in a db.
[00:26:52] <Cork> a_fejer: been in a similar situation; drupal ships with embeded jquery
[00:27:08] <Cork> and... well lets just say it didn't update much :)
[00:55:26] <pom_life> Velveeta: You there?
[01:13:04] <justHannes> is there any downside to using mutiple `$(document).ready(function () { … });` listeners in your code?
[01:16:59] <pom_life> What exactly is a '?' as an operator?
[01:20:30] <doev> is a script loaded again, if it is included multiple?
[01:29:01] <Tomashe> Hey guys im tying to convert a json string to an object. for that, im using $.parseJSON(json) , now , that is working perfectly in case the json is a json string, but some times i get json = '' or json = 'some string that is not json' , both scenerios makeing my script collapse. any idesa?
[01:29:21] <Tomashe> there is a way to prevent that collapse and just continue...
[01:33:04] <hello_> a
[01:33:39] <Tomashe> ?
[01:36:22] <Sendoushi> Tomashe: i can only remember going by the keys and check if it is ok
[01:36:42] <Sendoushi> i don't know if there is some faster and better function for such
[01:37:55] <Tomashe> yes but i keep getting "SyntaxError: Unexpected token a"
[01:38:11] <Tomashe> when  $.parseJSON(json) in case the json is not empty and not json string
[01:38:27] <Sendoushi> token a?
[01:38:39] <Sendoushi> is "a" a key from the json?
[01:38:42] <Sendoushi> from the object?
[01:38:48] <Tomashe> no
[01:39:59] <Cork> Tomashe: just check if(a)
[01:40:16] <Tomashe> how can i check ?
[01:40:22] <Sendoushi> Cork: it's a string
[01:40:27] <Cork> so?
[01:40:40] <Sendoushi> how will you check if exists when is inside a string?
[01:40:44] <Tomashe> first word is "array..."
[01:40:50] <Tomashe> so maybe its catching the A
[01:40:52] <Sendoushi> array?
[01:40:57] <Cork> opps wrong language :x
[01:40:57] <Tomashe> yes
[01:41:08] <Tomashe> yes yes its just output from my php api
[01:41:14] <Sendoushi> then it's wrong
[01:41:14] <Cork> if(json=='') { $.parseJSON() }
[01:41:24] <Sendoushi> you have to parse it
[01:41:26] <Cork> Tomashe: btw are you doing this in an ajax call?
[01:41:38] <Tomashe> the ajax call is great :)
[01:41:49] <Cork> if yes then you need to configure the server
[01:41:52] <Sendoushi> is your php api return a json object?
[01:41:58] <Tomashe> but im testing stuff and sometimes i get a string instead of the json string
[01:42:17] <Sendoushi> i guess you were better in the php channel but wait a second
[01:42:19] <Cork> Tomashe: you should never need to use $.parseJSON in $.ajax and friends
[01:42:20] <Tomashe> so im wondering if there is a way to validate it
[01:42:29] <Tomashe> what u mean?
[01:42:31] <Tomashe> why not ?
[01:42:32] <Sendoushi> validate... not really
[01:42:38] <Sendoushi> only with parse and catch the error
[01:42:47] <Cork> Tomashe: cause you only need to if the server lies about what data it sends
[01:42:47] <Sendoushi> the problem is in the api
[01:42:52] <Tomashe> hmm
[01:43:05] <Sendoushi> you can verify by parsing it instead of using parseJSON
[01:43:05] <Cork> Tomashe: if the server send Content-Type: application/json
[01:43:09] <Cork> when it actually sends json
[01:43:19] <Cork> you will get a parsed object instead of a string
[01:44:18] <hello_> d
[01:44:34] <hello_> df
[01:44:39] <Cork> <_<
[01:44:39] <hello_> df
[01:44:41] <hello_> df
[01:44:42] <hello_> df
[01:44:44] <hello_> df
[01:44:46] <Cork> hello_: drop it
[01:44:51] <hello_> how?
[01:45:33] <Sendoushi> Tomashe: if you don't have control over the api... you should just parse it in a custom function
[01:45:41] <Sendoushi> that's the way i see it...
[01:55:56] <_rooster_> i am having what is probbably a simple jquery error
[01:56:03] <_rooster_> but i am not sure how to even start trackign this down.
[01:56:16] <_rooster_> TypeError: $(...).best_in_place is not a function
[01:56:19] <_rooster_> not sure where to even start.
[01:56:25] <_rooster_> any suggestions?
[01:56:37] <Cork> 1. make sure the lib is actually loaded
[01:56:44] <Cork> 2. make sure it is loaded AFTER jquery
[01:56:52] <_rooster_> so, according to firebug
[01:56:53] <Cork> 3. make sure you don't load more then one jquery lib
[01:57:02] <_rooster_> the best_in_place.js file is in there
[01:57:49] <_rooster_> Cork: so, in firebug i pull down the list of js files that are loaded.
[01:57:58] <_rooster_> from the top to the bottom, jquery is lower in the list
[01:58:03] <_rooster_> does that mean it is being loaded after?
[01:58:22] <Cork> no it means it gets loaded nothing else
[01:58:31] <_rooster_> is there a way to tell what loads first?
[01:58:35] <Cork> check in the order you include them in the page
[01:58:47] <Cork> also is the scripts in head or in body?
[01:59:01] <_rooster_> so, for additiona info, this is a rails app
[01:59:15] <_rooster_> the order they are included should be correct.
[01:59:16] <Cork> doesn't really matter
[01:59:19] <_rooster_> on the page, i mean.
[01:59:23] <Cork> the html it generates is what matters
[01:59:27] <_rooster_> ok
[02:01:03] <_rooster_> Cork it does appear all the script tags are being put into the head
[02:01:19] <Cork> in the correct order?
[02:01:39] <Cork> also is the scripts merged or separate?
[02:01:46] <_rooster_> seperate
[02:02:14] <_rooster_> and it starts with jquery.js, jquery_ujs.js, jquery.purr.js, and then best_in_place.js
[02:02:24] <_rooster_> so it looks liek the right order
[02:02:25] <Cork> ok
[02:02:28] <Cork> ya
[02:02:37] <Cork> so point 3 then
[02:02:52] <_rooster_> which one was point 3?
[02:03:11] <Cork> it is up there just scroll there
[02:03:18] <_rooster_> oh right
[02:03:21] <_rooster_> more than one jquery library
[02:03:23] <_rooster_> checking now
[02:03:52] <seutje> can anyone make sense of this? http://pastebin.com/PeZYYyp0
[02:04:01] <_rooster_> oh interesting
[02:04:08] <_rooster_> so i have /assets/jquery.js
[02:04:15] <seutje> the clfn method just console.warn()s it
[02:04:19] <_rooster_> and i also ahve /asssets/jquery-purr/purr-example/jquery.js
[02:04:30] <_rooster_> Cork: that might be it?
[02:04:41] <Cork> _rooster_: not might; that is the reason
[02:04:52] <_rooster_> Cork:thanks!!!
[02:05:08] <Cork> seutje: use a pb that loads >_<
[02:05:17] <Cork> i get connection timeout for it
[02:05:52] <seutje> Cork: http://pastie.org/8721790
[02:06:19] <seutje> if there's touch, it init, and otherwise it doesn't? o.O
[02:06:53] <Cork> heh
[02:06:56] <Cork> ya
[02:07:06] <Cork> that code... is weird
[02:07:09] <seutje> wtf... a lil higher, there's a foo.bootstrap(); inside a regular doc.rdy
[02:07:18] <seutje> I don't understand q.q
[02:07:22] <_rooster_> Cork!!!!! holy crap you did it!
[02:07:29] <_rooster_> i have been beating my head on this things for way too long
[02:07:31] <_rooster_> so much thanks!
[02:07:38] <Cork> np
[02:08:24] <Cork> seutje: that code looks a bit over complicated
[02:08:34] <Cork> seutje: are they ever using the i again?
[02:08:38] <seutje> Cork: I'll paste u the entire file: http://pastie.org/8721796
[02:08:50] <seutje> not that I can tell
[02:09:14] <seutje> there's like 17 roads to this bootstrap
[02:09:25] <Cork> uh...
[02:09:32] <Cork> wtf
[02:09:55] <seutje> so I guess it only actually runs on the third (or second for touch capable devices)
[02:10:20] <seutje> I love doing intakes
[02:10:34] <Cork> seutje: this reminds me on when i tried to disect linkbucks.com yesterday
[02:10:52] <seutje> it's like a twisted alice in wonderland
[02:11:05] <Cork> ah
[02:11:09] <Cork> ya
[02:11:27] <seutje> yeah, I'm not falling for that one :P
[02:11:40] <Cork> falling?
[02:12:02] <Cork> no i meant i wrote a userscript that goes around the junk they have (without loading the js in the page)
[02:12:10] <seutje> oh
[02:12:13] <Cork> and they do a lot of silly things trying to hide what they do
[02:12:24] <seutje> advertising...
[02:12:39] <seutje> purty durty
[02:13:14] <Cork> like params['Au' + 'thKey'] = number; ... // params['Au' + 'th' + 'Key'] = wrong_number; ... params['Au' + 'th' + 'Key'] = right_number
[02:13:16] <Cork> and so on
[02:13:27] <Cork> super silly
[02:13:41] <Cork> and they load a JavaCrypt lib
[02:13:49] <seutje> lol
[02:13:51] <Cork> just to throw the disector off
[02:14:43] <lemonsparrow> is it possible to create an xml file from javascript ?
[02:14:48] <Cork> the content they pass through it is just gibrish and never used
[02:14:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes
[02:15:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any pointers to code ?
[02:15:07] <Cork> you create a normal document
[02:15:18] <Cork> and from then serialize it to xml
[02:15:31] <Cork> tried googling it?
[02:15:41] <Cork> should be plenty of hits
[02:15:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: serializartion happens at server side or client side ?
[02:15:54] <Cork> uh
[02:16:02] <seutje> doesn't rly matter
[02:16:05] <Cork> as it is generated with a dom it has to be client side
[02:16:18] <Cork> else your just generating a string
[02:16:28] <seutje> could use a headless on a server though
[02:16:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[02:16:47] <Cork> though that said
[02:16:51] <Cork> dom is slow in browsers
[02:16:53] <seutje> but I guess that's just spinning it off to cli or w/e
[02:16:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: want to send it to server
[02:17:03] <Cork> so ya, creating json and then using that is often smarter
[02:17:18] <seutje> send the datas, you know the structure anyway
[02:17:48] <Cork> xml is a kludge and is WAY over complicated for most use cases
[02:22:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/KS7sX8B2
[02:22:16] <lemonsparrow> seutje: this is my issue ^
[02:22:59] <Cork> lemonsparrow: remove the $() on line 1
[02:23:45] <sacho> <?xml is metadata, why would you want it?
[02:24:15] <Cork> not sure
[02:24:27] <Cork> but he is parsing the content twice
[02:25:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok got it
[02:26:31] <Cork> though ya i don't see why you need the xml doctype ( can't remember the real name for it...()
[02:48:20] <hyppias> How to select all <details> nodes except the $(this) details node ?
[03:03:03] <Cork> hyppias: $('details').not(this)
[03:03:37] <Sendoushi> jquery has a .not() ? nice
[03:03:45] <Cork> ?api not
[03:03:46] <b-ot> Cork: .not(): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[03:17:16] <macben> hi
[03:18:54] <macben> doesn't .on('click' ... ) fire also on appended html later in time?
[03:21:15] <fabioportieri> macben: if you use it in the delegate form, yes
[03:21:48] <fabioportieri> $(".parent").on("click,".target",function(...
[03:22:32] <fabioportieri> instead of $(".target").on("click",function()....
[03:24:32] <ajeremias> pff... i need to add: listen 443 ssl default_server; ^^
[03:38:27] <Sendoushi> i have an index.html and a main.js in the root folder. on the main i've set a config path for "./bower_components/jquery/src/css.js". The file inside uses require for getting the modules it needs like the core and such. the problem? the requires inside the css.js are relative to the root and not its folder
[03:44:48] <bigbugjava> Anyone has an idea why Fancybox might disable Bootstrap coursal?
[03:49:12] <effortDee> i need tl f
[03:49:26] <effortDee> i need to find out what was searched for in an ecommerce website keyword search
[04:16:02] <Sendoushi> anyone online?
[04:16:19] <seutje> about 800 ppl, at least!
[04:23:57] <prodigitalSon> hey guys, anyone using qunit ?
[04:24:39] <ankurk> I have a date coming in as YYYY-MM-DD, I want to show it as 11 Feb, 2014. Is it possible?
[04:25:31] <oakenshield> Is there a open source jQuery based office? Like google docs
[04:26:06] <oakenshield> assuming some backend php/mysql as well
[04:27:26] <oakenshield> or even basic text-editor that supports multi-user?
[04:28:41] <ankurk> Is it possible to serialize variables?
[04:32:32] <Cork> ankurk: sure
[04:32:41] <Cork> what is the content?
[04:33:21] <ankurk> Cork: https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8933995
[04:33:27] <FernandoBasso> oakenshield: I have never seen something like that with "jQuery". There are other stuff, though: http://fredkschott.com/post/2013/05/introducing-covim-real-time-collaboration-for-vim/
[04:33:35] <Cork> oh
[04:33:54] <Cork> ankurk: you could just put them in an object and it would be done
[04:34:04] <ankurk> How?
[04:34:17] <ankurk> I am not that familiar with objects :(
[04:34:23] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: I see, thanks
[04:34:36] <Cork> var data = { itemId: $tr.find('td:nth-child(2)').text(), case_id: $('#edit_punch_list_dialog input[name=CaseId]').val(), table_id: $('#edit_punch_list_dialog input[name=Table_Id]').val() };
[04:34:44] <Cork> then just give the object ot ajax
[04:35:59] <FernandoBasso> oakenshield: Perhaps ACE also supports something similar.
[04:36:07] <ankurk> okay, let me try
[04:37:02] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: The basic goal is to be able to cooperate on code, so the vim stuff is kinda awesome
[04:37:26] <FernandoBasso> oakenshield: But the downside is that not everyone likes or knows how to use vim.
[04:37:53] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: Are u a emacs guy? ;)
[04:38:21] <ajeremias> jedit ftw \m/
[04:39:16] <FernandoBasso> oakenshield: https://c9.io/
[04:39:21] <FernandoBasso> Nope. I am a vim guy.
[04:39:44] <FernandoBasso> Although I would like to master emacs as well, would the time permit.
[04:39:51] <ankurk> Cork: That worked! Thanks! I guess I need to familiar myself more with objects :)
[04:40:20] <Cork> ankurk: ya, you do
[04:40:29] <Cork> objects is most everything in javascript
[04:40:29] <FernandoBasso> oakenshield: http://www.firepad.io/examples/#-uSDojsDDIA
[04:40:35] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: Looks great! Though, I'm trying to move off the cloud as much as possible, i.e. open source --> self-hosted
[04:41:07] <FernandoBasso> firepad seems to be for you then.
[04:42:03] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: That really looks like something!
[04:42:11] <oakenshield> FernandoBasso: I'll check it out, thank you :)
[04:45:32] <ankurk> Cork: you're right
[04:45:59] <Cork> ankurk: but in it simplest form it is just a set of key values
[04:51:13] <ankurk> yep
[04:51:27] <ankurk> I will surely look into it in more detail :D
[04:52:46] <TheJHNZ> how would you select a next visible element ?
[04:53:14] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: if you have a class for it to set visible...
[04:53:39] <Sendoushi> stick css properties inside css and javascript only adds and removes classes
[04:53:56] <Cork> TheJHNZ: you want next sibling?
[04:53:58] <TheJHNZ> im trying to grab the next visible
[04:54:00] <Sendoushi> if you do so... you can simply request a $() with the selector
[04:54:00] <Cork> or?
[04:54:11] <TheJHNZ> well i have a list with <li>
[04:54:15] <Cork> TheJHNZ: but you need to define next?
[04:54:27] <Cork> is it the next that isn't display: none
[04:54:34] <Cork> the next that is actually in view
[04:54:35] <TheJHNZ> i have the hiding done
[04:54:36] <Cork> or... ?
[04:54:48] <TheJHNZ> but it hides the hidden one each time
[04:54:51] <TheJHNZ> as it's the next()
[04:55:07] <TheJHNZ> $('#files-wrapper').find('ul').find('li:first-child').next().hide();
[04:55:11] <Cork> please answer the question
[04:55:34] <TheJHNZ> i need to make it hide the next visible
[04:55:42] <Ortund> I'm trying to scroll between sections on my page for navigation, but I feel like I'm missing something here... http://pastebin.com/6T4cv5pj
[04:55:46] <Cork> that wasn't the question
[04:56:36] <Ortund> don't suppose someone can look over my jquery there and tell what I'm missing?
[04:58:20] <TheJHNZ> Corey:
[04:58:25] <TheJHNZ> Cork: how do you mean
[04:58:36] <Cork> <Cork> TheJHNZ: but you need to define next?
[04:58:36] <Cork> <Cork> is it the next that isn't display: none
[04:58:36] <Cork> <Cork> the next that is actually in view
[04:58:36] <Cork> <Cork> or... ?
[04:58:57] <Cork> "visible" is overloaded
[04:59:18] <TheJHNZ> yes the next that isnt display none
[04:59:23] <Cork> ok
[04:59:36] <Cork> .nextAll(':visible').first()
[04:59:55] <Cork> that is if you want sibling
[05:00:01] <TheJHNZ> thankyou
[05:07:40] <anli_> Is this a correct selector? $('#vCalendar [data-role=view-title]')
[05:08:36] <Cork> anli_: quote the values in an attribute selector
[05:08:44] <Cork> but other then that it is a valid selector
[05:09:09] <anli_> ok
[05:09:16] <anli_> quote data-role as well?
[05:09:25] <anli_> The length of the selected elements is 1
[05:09:37] <anli_> So it is perhaps evaluated as intended
[05:10:43] <Cork> anli_: no need
[05:10:57] <anli_> Ah, seems like kendoui does not want me to change title behind its back
[05:11:03] <Cork> you arn't allowed to have weird character in those anyway
[05:15:51] <Ortund> can someone help me with $("html").data() ... I'm trying to set data-page-id when I click on a link
[05:22:28] <Ortund> nevermind... some quick css changes and I don't need to do that anymore
[05:23:11] <lite_> Say I have the following listener set up: var element = $('.fooBar').on('keyDown', function(){ model = .... }; will this listener and all variables set up in the function get tagged for GC once the 'fooBar' element gets removed?
[05:30:22] <seutje> lite_: sure, unless that model variable is defined in a higher scope
[05:31:53] <lite_> alright
[05:33:33] <Cork> well the event listeners and stuff is removed when the elements is gc
[05:33:42] <Cork> and the element is gc:ed when nothing references it
[05:34:03] <kpl> For a generic function using ajax to call an url and get a value, does it make sense to: function get(action,vect){ $.ajax({ async: false, url: action, dataType: "text", data: null, success: function (Data){vect.content=Data;} }); var vect = {}; get("myaction",vect); //now my value is in vect.content  ?
[05:38:12] <lite_> so. ive been trying to familiarise myself with chromes developer tools and read that nodes marked in yellow are nodes kept alive because a javascript object still holds a reference to it. im just having difficulties making heads of this http://imgur.com/cHU8pSw
[05:50:34] <seutje> lite_: those are document fragments, usually result from doing stuff like var foo = $('<div />'); and then never inserting it into the DOM
[05:51:32] <lite_> Alright. so most likely i have a function living somewhere that assigns a bunch of variables and never inserts them into the DOM?
[05:51:49] <lite_> And consequently, how do I locate this function ?
[05:53:13] <seutje> that's the tricky part
[05:53:44] <lite_> tell me about it. ive spent the better part of a week locating leaks :/
[05:53:58] <TheJHNZ> what would the easiest way to disable a click once clicked ?
[05:54:15] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: peventDefault
[05:54:23] <Sendoushi> preventDefault
[05:54:46] <TheJHNZ> i am using prevent default, but it can still be double clicked
[05:54:56] <TheJHNZ> and if i use one() and double click it goes to the href
[05:55:22] <Sendoushi> preventDefault should take care of that
[05:55:35] <TheJHNZ> yes im using on click
[05:55:35] <Sendoushi> though i think you also have an event for double click
[05:55:40] <TheJHNZ> but it can be clicked more than once
[05:55:47] <lite_> seutje: what does the __proto__ thing mean? It seems that all of my red nodes have a yellow __proto__ property
[05:55:55] <TheJHNZ> if you're quick enough you can click it more than once
[05:55:55] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_ondblclick.asp
[05:56:13] <Sendoushi> but what are you trying to do?
[05:56:23] <TheJHNZ> prevent a bug
[05:56:31] <Sendoushi> :| that doesn't say much
[05:56:44] <Sendoushi> what is your action? why do you click and what do you want it to do?
[05:56:48] <Sendoushi> why are you using one() ?
[05:56:54] <seutje> `mdn proto
[05:56:56] <b-ot> seutje: proto - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto
[05:56:58] <TheJHNZ> im not
[05:57:02] <TheJHNZ> i was trying it
[05:57:10] <Sendoushi> dunno why :|
[05:57:25] <Sendoushi> you have to specify a little more your problem for me to help you
[05:57:25] <TheJHNZ> http://i.imgur.com/o6J1lo0.gif'
[05:57:26] <TheJHNZ> http://i.imgur.com/o6J1lo0.gif
[05:57:47] <TheJHNZ> see this gif, if you click the folder fast enough it'll create multiple breadcrums for it
[05:58:07] <Sendoushi> ah then you're seeing your problem upside down
[05:58:15] <TheJHNZ> :p
[05:58:22] <Sendoushi> so you're doing preventDefault on the anchor so it doesn't act like an anchor right?
[05:58:27] <TheJHNZ> yes
[05:58:31] <TheJHNZ> and sending the href to ajax
[05:58:38] <Sendoushi> on the function where you set the click you enter and create the breadcrumb right?
[05:58:40] <TheJHNZ> which creates the breadcrum as well
[05:59:15] <Sendoushi> the thing i would do, depending on how are you doing because i think the architecture isn't that well for this to happen, is to flag it
[05:59:16] <seutje> TheJHNZ: does the breadcrumb get created upon ajax response or upon click?
[05:59:26] <TheJHNZ> apon success yes
[05:59:36] <seutje> sounds like ur not killing ongoing ajax requests
[05:59:41] <Sendoushi> like if (wasClicked) { return preventDefault } doBreadCrumb()
[05:59:46] <TheJHNZ> how would i repvent what ?
[05:59:50] <TheJHNZ> prevent*
[05:59:55] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: flag is a way to do it
[06:00:07] <TheJHNZ> so probably like, when success change a var?
[06:00:11] <Sendoushi> if it was already clicked you don't want to ajx it again
[06:00:19] <TheJHNZ> true
[06:00:21] <seutje> store ur ajax request and call abort() on it
[06:00:22] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: i would say on click
[06:00:31] <TheJHNZ> im using on click
[06:00:31] <Sendoushi> no need for abort in this case seutje
[06:00:44] <Sendoushi> in this case requests are made when they shouldn't
[06:00:51] <seutje> makes more sense to abort an reinit imo, but alright
[06:00:53] <TheJHNZ> alright
[06:01:04] <seutje> also less convoluted
[06:01:11] <Sendoushi> oh well different opinions :)
[06:01:22] <seutje> what if u click 2 different ones really fast?
[06:01:34] <TheJHNZ> lol seutje havent tried that
[06:01:41] <Sendoushi> it depends seutje
[06:01:52] <Sendoushi> if he is using a main.js for example and setting the var
[06:02:01] <Sendoushi> who cares? he can even press a thousand
[06:02:13] <Sendoushi> he already set the wasClicked so... nothing will happen
[06:02:15] <TheJHNZ> http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ02-12-03-02-15.png
[06:02:25] <Sendoushi> when he gets inside the folder he can unset wasClicked
[06:02:43] <seutje> haha, so he should keep a global boolean and reset it every time?
[06:02:49] <Sendoushi> that way he won't ajax unnecessarily
[06:02:51] <TheJHNZ> ._.
[06:02:58] <Sendoushi> global? who is talking about global?
[06:03:19] <seutje> brilliant, so clicking A, then clicking B will respond with A :D
[06:03:20] <Sendoushi> concept of the modular view seutje
[06:03:31] <Sendoushi> what the hell...?
[06:03:35] <TheJHNZ> no it responds b
[06:03:40] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ, seutje i'll fiddle
[06:03:49] <Sendoushi> seutje: of course i'm not saying that
[06:03:57] <seutje> click a, check is clicked, nope, click B, check is clicked, yep, do nothing ... A response returns...
[06:04:02] <TheJHNZ> and puts the first breadcrum first and the second click after http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ02-12-03-03-41.png
[06:04:37] <TheJHNZ> (maths shouldnt be after english)
[06:04:46] <TheJHNZ> those are the two folders i clicked
[06:06:46] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: preparing an example...
[06:06:55] <TheJHNZ> alright :-)
[06:06:59] <TheJHNZ> i think i understand your own
[06:07:00] <TheJHNZ> one*
[06:08:17] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: http://jsfiddle.net/9V3er/ seutje this here is modular but it could be even inside an object, lets say... a view object!
[06:09:01] <seutje> but wasClicked is global to all the links
[06:09:11] <Sendoushi> seutje: that is what he needs
[06:09:22] <Sendoushi> a "global" view variable
[06:09:34] <Sendoushi> this way he won't reach the ajax
[06:09:36] <seutje> let's simulate a simultaneous click: http://jsfiddle.net/9V3er/1/
[06:09:44] <seutje> second never updates although it was clicked last
[06:09:53] <seutje> as a user, that isn't what I would expect
[06:09:58] <Sendoushi> he doesn't want it to update
[06:10:07] <Sendoushi> that was the first problem
[06:10:26] <Sendoushi> he wants to ajax and when the request comes and it advances on the breadcrumb, reset it
[06:10:35] <seutje> the problem was that the success handler for both was being run instead of just the last
[06:10:50] <Sendoushi> he wants to have just a request
[06:10:55] <Sendoushi> why would he need the second?
[06:11:05] <Sendoushi> clicks, one action happens
[06:11:16] <Sendoushi> not clicks one action while happening clicks again...
[06:11:21] <seutje> lol, nevermind, I seem to fail to explain
[06:11:34] <Sendoushi> lol i guess we both do :P
[06:11:44] <delboy1978uk1> whats the easiest way to split a youtube url to grab the bit after v= in js/jquery?
[06:12:03] <Sendoushi> delboy1978uk1: regEx and match :P
[06:12:31] <seutje> `api param
[06:12:32] <b-ot> seutje: No matches.
[06:12:36] <seutje> `api jquery.param
[06:12:37] <b-ot> seutje: jQuery.param(): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[06:12:48] <seutje> wait, that's the other way around, isn't it?
[06:12:50] <Sendoushi> didn't know about that one seutje interesting
[06:12:51] <delboy1978uk1> regex? blackmagic? er i said easiest lol
[06:13:06] <delboy1978uk1> looking up match though
[06:13:16] <Sendoushi> :D it really is blackmagic but in my point of view... that's the best approach
[06:13:23] <delboy1978uk1> it works great
[06:13:24] <Sendoushi> find someone who can help you with the regex for it
[06:13:33] <delboy1978uk1> if you can get one off regexlib
[06:13:59] <delboy1978uk1> what about split a string like explode in php? i could explode by =
[06:14:08] <Sendoushi> you could also do that
[06:14:16] <Sendoushi> though regex is better :p
[06:14:19] <seutje> like split?
[06:14:21] <delboy1978uk1> creating a two part array, my data would be in the second part

[06:14:27] <b-ot> seutje: String.prototype.split() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[06:14:31] <delboy1978uk1> split yeah maybe thats all i need#
[06:14:34] <Sendoushi> yep it's what seutje is saying
[06:14:46] <delboy1978uk1> cheers i'll check that out
[06:15:14] <TheJHNZ> so global variable it is :P
[06:15:28] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: becareful with global variables
[06:15:32] <Sendoushi> module it!
[06:15:46] <Sendoushi> don't get a global in the window
[06:15:48] <TheJHNZ> module o.o
[06:16:03] <Sendoushi> see what i did with the function () {}() self invoking?
[06:16:16] <Sendoushi> that way i won't have access to the wasClicked in the normal scope
[06:16:29] <TheJHNZ> ahh
[06:16:31] <delboy1978uk1> how would i access the second key in my newly formed array?
[06:16:42] <Sendoushi> delboy1978uk1: arr[1]
[06:16:44] <Sendoushi> like php
[06:17:13] <Sendoushi> TheJHNZ: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwYPG6vreJg :) douglas crockford talks about that
[06:17:29] <delboy1978uk1> ah thank god i like a bit of similarity lol
[06:18:08] <Sendoushi> i hear you. i was in php before using javascript frameworks and such
[06:18:14] <seutje> unlike php, if ur array keys aren't integers, you really can't call it an array anymore :P
[06:18:34] <delboy1978uk1> yeah i'm ok with a json object
[06:18:36] <Sendoushi> you call it an object :P
[06:18:40] <seutje> s/call it/threat it as
[06:19:23] <delboy1978uk1> sendoushi you mean you stopped using php?
[06:19:28] <Sendoushi> i did
[06:19:34] <Sendoushi> i only use it now for php apis
[06:19:34] <delboy1978uk1> in favour of what?
[06:19:39] <Uhkis> this unterminated regex makes my eyes bleed
[06:19:42] <Sendoushi> cheaper to do
[06:19:47] <seutje> I delegate PHP shits nowadays :P
[06:19:52] <Sendoushi> i use js frameworks
[06:20:01] <delboy1978uk1> all regex makes your eyes bleed. like i said its black magic. powerful stuff
[06:20:06] <seutje> just let other ppl do it and bitch at them when the markup sucks
[06:20:11] <Sendoushi> or just simple and plain js for basic stuff
[06:20:19] <Uhkis> delboy1978uk1: what?! regex is beautiful!
[06:20:20] <Sendoushi> lol seutje +1
[06:20:30] <delboy1978uk1> not at all the latest versions of php are incredible compared to the bag of shit we used to develop with
[06:20:35] <Sendoushi> Uhkis: it's like klingon
[06:20:47] <Sendoushi> php is getting interesting but still... i prefer javascript
[06:20:51] <delboy1978uk1> beautiful in its functionality! pig ugly in appearance!
[06:20:59] <TheJHNZ> alright think it's good now
[06:21:00] <Sendoushi> javascript well coded is beautiful
[06:21:42] <delboy1978uk1> any well coded code can be beautiful. except regex. the elephant man of code
[06:22:02] <seutje> good luck making brainfuck look like anything but... well, brainfuck
[06:22:02] <Sendoushi> php not really... you join html markup inside of it
[06:22:06] <Sendoushi> and... what the...
[06:22:10] <Sendoushi> lol
[06:22:34] <seutje> Sendoushi: nothing stops you from using SimpleXML or something
[06:22:35] <Sendoushi> php for apis, javascript for the browser. perfect sense for me!
[06:22:43] <Uhkis> Sendoushi: unless you use the right framework where you never have to type html :-)
[06:23:01] <Sendoushi> true. laravel is pretty interesting in that field
[06:23:47] <Sendoushi> i still prefer javascript :P
[06:24:14] <delboy1978uk1> you still need to type html into laravel
[06:24:25] <Sendoushi> no
[06:24:29] <Sendoushi> you can use blade template system
[06:24:37] <delboy1978uk1> yes and that contains html
[06:24:41] <delboy1978uk1> and some blade markup
[06:24:44] <Sendoushi> in html format
[06:24:52] <Sendoushi> in html syntax coloring :P
[06:25:18] <delboy1978uk1> you guys should try Emmet
[06:25:32] <delboy1978uk1> might even be built in to your IDE
[06:25:51] <Sendoushi> i use emmet
[06:25:53] <Sendoushi> sometimes...
[06:26:13] <delboy1978uk1> me too i keep forgetting i have that functionality sitting right here lol
[06:40:42] <softplay> can anyone help with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21703950/selection-and-focus-on-element-of-webpage-not-working-offset ?

[06:43:11] <ashgotti> Good morning. I have a project that has 5 pages and am using Jquery Mobile UI + Page transitions to jump back and forth between them. It works very well except for one of hte pages, I have a script that works if go directly to the page, but if navigate from the first page doesn't. It seems to do with how jQuery is fetching the pages? Any ideas?
[06:43:30] <seutje> ur actually not removing the offset from the element, as it is read only afaik, instead ur unsetting the scrolltop of the wrapper
[06:44:21] <shvelo> Can anyone help me? I need this to center on the selected element http://jsfiddle.net/rm97S/2/
[06:45:42] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to get the first 5 or so elements?

[06:48:32] <TheJHNZ> :(
[06:48:39] <seutje> oh wait, the method is no more
[06:49:10] <seutje> well, u can always use .filter(function(i) { return i < 5; })
[06:49:20] <seutje> or just :lt(5) :P

[07:20:43] <slax0r> hi, how can I easily access a .serializeArray() object? I want to serialize my form, and access the forms input field named xyz i.e.
[07:21:44] <BillCriswell>  slax0r: You'd just have to loop through and change the one you want.
[07:22:06] <slax0r> yeah, thought so
[07:22:19] <slax0r> got to an easier solution before that, input[name=xyz]
[07:22:23] <slax0r> as selector

[07:26:52] <basiclaser> hey guys any ideas why tubular doesn't work in opera/FF ? are there any alternatives that work everywhere?
[07:32:25] <g105b> basiclaser: just use an iframe with a style attribute.
[07:32:32] <g105b> no js required.
[07:32:45] <g105b> although, that being said, why am I in the jquery room?
[07:33:13] <softplay> thank yoi seutje
[07:34:59] <basiclaser> g105b: lol. thanks. so youre saying just do it myself ? ^ ^
[07:35:46] <g105b> basiclaser: In most situations, jquery abstracts away complex problems into a nice interface. But when A) the problem isn't complex and B) jquery doesn't work for you, I suggest doing it yourself.
[07:36:14] <harbhub> quick easy question
[07:36:23] <harbhub> $(".className a")
[07:36:35] <harbhub> will that find the element with class="className"
[07:36:45] <harbhub> and then find its child with element tag "a"
[07:36:45] <harbhub> ?
[07:36:55] <harbhub> i have a div with an a in it
[07:37:04] <harbhub> the div has a className
[07:37:13] <harbhub> and i want the anchor inside the div
[07:37:37] <g105b> basiclaser: add this as the first element to your page: <iframe id="tubular-player" style="position: fixed; width: 1688px; height: 949px; left: -544px; top: 0px;" frameborder="0"width="615" height="346" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ab0TSkLe-E0?controls=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;"></iframe>
[07:41:08] <ankurk> How can I update a table row after Ajax update?
[07:42:45] <basiclaser> g105b: thanks! Your solution sucked much less than tubular. The audio played in FF, and full vid played in chrome and opera, but they were way offset, half the video was missing :P
[07:42:56] <harbhub> g105b
[07:42:59] <harbhub> wanna help me?
[07:43:21] <thang> ankurk: success callback
[07:44:09] <basiclaser> g105b: ill fiddle with the settings, this is great! thankyou
[07:44:34] <g105b> basiclaser: You're welcome. Reconsider if you 'need' jquery for your next problem ;)
[07:44:58] <g105b> harbhub: no need to ask if you can ask, just go ahead and ask your question and if someone can answer it, they will.
[07:45:43] <basiclaser> g105b: i never used an iframe before. The idea of inserting videos as backgrounds was totally far away from me :P
[07:45:48] <harbhub> i did ask my question lmao
[07:45:52] <basiclaser> i will have a different attitude next time
[07:45:56] <harbhub> anyways my answer worked
[07:45:58] <harbhub> so i'm good
[07:45:59] <harbhub> thanks
[07:47:08] <g105b> harbhub: I must have blanked your questioning style
[07:47:32] <g105b> basiclaser: that's all the tubular plugin does - pops that exact iframe into the document.
[07:48:25] <decx> i'd suggest the youtube iframe api, give you more control if you want a bunch of videos
[07:48:59] <g105b> decx: youtube iframe api?
[07:49:36] <decx> every embed loads all the required scripts separately
[07:49:42] <decx> https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#IFrame_Player_API
[07:49:54] <g105b> isn't that what the iframe I pasted uses?
[07:50:25] <decx> no

It seems to do with how jQuery is fetching the pages? Any ideas? This is the script http://jsfiddle.net/s45jk/1/
[07:58:39] <ankurk> Can I pass the current table row reference to a jquery dialog? I have a "Edit" button in front of a row which opens a dialog.
[07:59:11] <ankurk> I want to use that reference, basically I want to update that specific row after successful update
[08:05:02] <MariusIT> Hey guys, i'm trying to fix the slideToggle jumpy animation in this script http://jsfiddle.net/z6cer/
[08:05:18] <MariusIT> how can i set the inline height or the json grabbed data?
[08:07:08] <MariusIT> the fetched result is something like <ul><li>123</li><li>456</li><li>789</li></ul>  <ul><li>012</li>.... </ul> the ul are allways 3, but the number of lines if pushed depending on the ammound of fetched data
[08:07:15] <MariusIT> help!
[08:10:11] <ankurk> Anyone?
[08:14:21] <styks1987> why does sortable include an empty first element in its toArray function?
[08:14:42] <styks1987> Is there a way to remove that first element and keep the left right values for the rest?
[08:15:41] <randomg> hi, cany anyone hear me
[08:15:48] <styks1987> yes
[08:15:51] <randomg> okay
[08:16:10] <randomg> i have a quick question - what is the difference between doing a handler by id or a handler by 'this'
[08:16:40] <ankurk> Can I pass the current table row reference to a jquery dialog? I have a "Edit" button in front of a row which opens a dialog. I want to use that reference, basically I want to update that specific row after successful update
[08:44:23] <Paladine> hey peeps can someone help me out, I am trying to figure out how to make my carousel slide right when I click on the right "click" link as in this example http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/
[08:44:29] <Paladine> I can make it slide left but not right
[08:44:39] <Paladine> setting a negative marginRight doesn't seem to work
[08:47:03] <skyjumper> anyone have a preferred way to queue ajax requests?
[08:49:01] <duch_kazatel> Paladine why not use a positive margin left?
[08:49:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/2/
[08:49:12] <duch_kazatel> or use a prebuilt carousel?
[08:49:55] <Paladine> postivie left margin doesn't work, it doesn't slide in the previous slide, it just slide in white space
[08:50:15] <duch_kazatel> you'
[08:50:23] <duch_kazatel> *you'll have to add in logic to handle that.
[08:50:38] <WrinkledCheese> From what I read, attr('value') is prefered over .val()?
[08:50:43] <duch_kazatel> a negative margin-right is going to have basically the same effect as a positive margin-left.
[08:50:57] <Paladine> a negative right margin doesn't work at all
[08:51:04] <duch_kazatel> WrinkledCheese huh?
[08:51:13] <duch_kazatel> WrinkledCheese it depends on what you're trying to do.
[08:51:31] <WrinkledCheese> .attr('value') is recommended over .val
[08:51:38] <WrinkledCheese> .val()
[08:51:38] <b-ot> WrinkledCheese: for form fields
[08:51:42] <WrinkledCheese> Yes
[08:52:10] <duch_kazatel> i haven't heard of that, WrinkledCheese
[08:52:16] <duch_kazatel> Paladine my example works, but doesn't have the extra code to move the correct node into place before the animation runs.
[08:52:56] <WrinkledCheese> I see
[08:52:57] <WrinkledCheese> Alright
[08:53:06] <duch_kazatel> WrinkledCheese http://stackoverflow.com/a/4837162/923919
[08:53:13] <WrinkledCheese> I will find the documentation and post what I find.  Maybe I misread it.
[08:53:25] <duch_kazatel> they both do something similar-ish
[08:53:47] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, yeah that is what I already had except I changed it like this (basically the same) http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/3/
[08:54:02] <Paladine> I am not sure how to move the relevant li child to the previous position
[08:54:46] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/
[08:54:54] <duch_kazatel> there's also an insertAfter()
[08:55:05] <skypce> hello guys
[08:56:02] <airdem> if one wants to catch every keypress on a website
[08:56:18] <airdem> $('*').keypress(); ?
[08:56:38] <NoiseEee> $('body').on('keypress',function() { //never use above syntax again })
[08:56:39] <duch_kazatel> or $(document).on('keypress', function(){});
[08:57:00] <airdem> alright, thank you
[08:57:24] <xmichaelx> Hello, I want to create input plugin for angle in xx h xx m xx.xxxx s form, where user can only input numbers in x and I have idea on how to do it. Could any of you listen to it and tell me if it makes sense?
[08:58:59] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, I still have no idea how to do it lol
[08:59:28] <duch_kazatel> Paladine $('elementYouWantToCopy').insertBefore('elementYouWantItToAppearBefore');
[09:00:00] <Paladine> yeah I get that bit but how do I find out what the previous element is?
[09:00:23] <decx> i did some tests with "normal" people and text carousels, they'll just keep clicking next even if they read the text 2 times, on the third round they'll notice and become agitated
[09:01:05] <decx> so now prefer to have a breakpoint and rewind the slide animation to the first
[09:01:12] <duch_kazatel> Paladine is there a reason you're not using a prerolled carousel at this point?
[09:01:19] <decx> if i have to do a carousel
[09:01:25] <Paladine> duch - yeah this is simpler
[09:01:33] <Paladine> I can use .prev() right?
[09:01:55] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/prev/
[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[09:01:59] <skypce> hello guys, how can i add more finded elements to this code?http://pastebin.com/TYh8vuCr
[09:02:27] <duch_kazatel> skypce huh?
[09:03:18] <skypce> duch_kazatel, by example i have a product div and inside i want that when hover element apply image sprite, h1 underline, p underline
[09:04:19] <skypce> duch_kazatel, i want add other finds por add classes to other elements
[09:04:48] <airdem> how do i check if ANY form element has focus?
[09:04:49] <duch_kazatel> doesn't find support standard selectors?
[09:05:05] <airdem> $('*').is(':focus') ?
[09:05:33] <duch_kazatel> $(':focus');
[09:05:38] <decx> we need to have a * intervention airdem
[09:05:56] <duch_kazatel> airdem avoid using the asterisk selector at all costs.  it's slow.
[09:06:08] <duch_kazatel> do something like $('input:focus'); instead.
[09:06:09] <airdem> duch_kazatel, what about ANY but one specific element?
[09:06:27] <Sendoushi> no issue list in jquery github?
[09:06:51] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi http://contribute.jquery.org/
[09:06:59] <Sendoushi> there we go :)
[09:07:06] <airdem>  $('input[id!="foo"]:focus') like this?
[09:07:28] <duch_kazatel> airdem you could also apply a filter instead.
[09:07:32] <airdem>  $('input[id!="foo"]).is(':focus') would this be the same returning bool instead of objects??
[09:08:01] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi this is the bug tracker for jquery: http://bugs.jquery.com/report
[09:12:56] <BillCriswell> $(document.activeElement).is(':not(#foo)')  ?
[09:20:15] <ankurk> Guys, I am getting this TypeError: Object parsererror has no method 'text'  :(
[09:21:57] <ankurk> Happening on the 'Status.Text' line, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/8939510
[09:26:01] <BillCriswell> ankurk: What is status?
[09:26:10] <BillCriswell> Duh.
[09:26:12] <duch_kazatel> ankurk do a console.log on status
[09:26:13] <BillCriswell> I'm an idiot.
[09:26:57] <ankurk> let me do a console.logh
[09:27:08] <NaN> how can I use "this" inside a function that is called with 'on' event? (I need 'this' to be the 'parent' object)
[09:27:38] <duch_kazatel> NaN huh?
[09:27:52] <BillCriswell> NaN: Probably better to do var $parent = $(this).parent(); then use $parent in place of this.
[09:29:12] <ankurk> status console.log shows parse error
[09:29:15] <ankurk> hmm
[09:29:16] <NaN> >> http://jsfiddle.net/jRL8n/
[09:32:51] <ankurk> In other news, I solved, that was a weird one
[09:32:58] <duch_kazatel> NaN you're calling a method that isn't defined yet
[09:33:28] <Velveeta> nan: use $.proxy, i'll show you
[09:33:55] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/jRL8n/6/
[09:34:14] <Velveeta> you need to bind your scope to that function so that it executes in the scope of your object
[09:36:16] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, I can't get this to work man no matter what I do :/
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> Paladine link to the fiddle again?
[09:39:09] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Never used proxy. Hwo would you go about accessing the button using that approach?
[09:39:14] <Paladine> here is the original one http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/
[09:39:58] <Velveeta> billcriswell: you'd have to store it off to a variable and access it by that variable reference
[09:40:03] <Velveeta> or else pass it in as a parameter
[09:40:34] <Velveeta> you could do something like this: var button = $('button:first'); button.on('click', $.proxy(this.clickHandler, this, button));
[09:40:43] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[09:40:53] <Velveeta> and then have var obj = { clickHandler: function (button) { button.trigger('something'); } };
[09:41:34] <Velveeta> i don't use proxy very often outside of jquery widgets, but i use it a lot for internal development of those, and then just reference this.element when i need to
[09:43:15] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Makes sense.
[09:43:15] <paul_____> Hi
[09:43:44] <duch_kazatel> Paladine your logic is backwards.
[09:44:04] <paul_____> Can anyone help on how to have a sticky footer with jquery
[09:45:03] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, why?
[09:45:08] <Sendoushi> here i am checking one of the paul irish video talks about jquery. he is saying sizzle is slower than just using .find() what do you have to say to this? the talk has 3 years
[09:45:25] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi he's right.
[09:45:48] <Sendoushi> so you shouldn't ever use sizzle and just use find().find().find() is that it?
[09:46:33] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi not necessarily.
[09:46:48] <Sendoushi> could you please elaborate a little?
[09:47:05] <duch_kazatel> you're going to use sizzle for your first selector.  if you're doing a lot of DOM traversal, then yeah use .find();
[09:47:09] <bijoo_> Hi, I saw a great documentation; it's a website that has all the lines there; and for each line, it explains the reason. Do you know what that website is off-hand?
[09:47:10] <duch_kazatel> but don't do premature optimization.
[09:47:33] <Sendoushi> hm
[09:47:39] <quiteFrank> THES HYBRID APES INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE !!  !!  !!
[09:48:33] <duch_kazatel> Paladine first of all, you're resetting margin after animation completes for the left slide.  that prevents you from being able to properly insert content before the current slide.  second of all, you need to prepend content BEFORE you animate on the right animation click.
[09:48:36] <Raydiation> why do people include jquery from google apis?
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation because it's a reasonably fast, free CDN
[09:49:03] <Raydiation> cant you simply host it yourself?
[09:49:15] <Velveeta> i'm absolutely with duch_kazatel on the premature optimization bit, don't look at your code through the scope of trying to squeeze every single last cpu cycle out of it
[09:49:16] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation sure, but if you're not using a CDN it might not be as fast.
[09:49:33] <Raydiation> you can just cache it
[09:49:36] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi have you ever worked on a big project with other people?
[09:49:40] <Velveeta> you should only optimize when you have need to, typically readability and ease of maintenance trump performance optimizations
[09:49:48] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: i'm working in baboom :)
[09:50:01] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation sure, you can.  but initial pageloads are a motherfucker ;)
[09:50:08] <Sendoushi> one of the main reasons i want to evolve and know about every little optimization piece
[09:50:16] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation you can either spend big bucks on a CDN, or use somebody else's when possible.
[09:50:36] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi learn about what sizzle does under the hood.
[09:50:37] <Raydiation> duch_kazatel: i dont think its that important
[09:50:44] <Velveeta> there's no one way to optimize, and there's no "right" way to consider on how to optimize.. sometimes you might need to optimize for dom traversal, other times for memory footprint, other times for cpu overhead
[09:50:46] <Raydiation> apart from that you allow google to track people
[09:50:48] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation oh ok.  i'll be sure to tell my employer that, then :)
[09:51:00] <Sendoushi> i'll check it duch_kazatel
[09:51:02] <Velveeta> you need to know what you're targeting in a given optimization and restructure your code accordingly
[09:51:27] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation you could also use one of the many other CDNs out there.
[09:51:52] <bijoo_> By the way I found it, thanks HackerNews: http://www.keyframesandcode.com/resources/javascript/deconstructed/jquery/
[09:51:54] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: true
[09:51:56] <Velveeta> raydiation: one nice thing about using something like google's cdn is that you automatically benefit from the browser cache, if your users have ever visited any other pages that load from that same cdn
[09:51:59] <Raydiation> duch_kazatel: btw, any hoster i had til now had at least 100mbit uplink
[09:52:02] <Velveeta> since your resources are cached by url
[09:52:40] <Velveeta> the uplink isn't always the issue, because you can only push as fast as other people can pull
[09:52:41] <duch_kazatel> Raydiation uplink is one thing.  physical proximity is another.
[09:52:49] <Raydiation> ah i see
[09:52:51] <Velveeta> and for some users on slower networks, like cell networks, that can be seconds
[09:52:56] <duch_kazatel> latency is a thing.  there's a reason akamai makes so much money.
[09:53:01] <Sendoushi> lets say... you have 5 levels from body to an element what would you do? $('body el') or $('body').find('el') ?
[09:53:24] <Velveeta> i would just do $('el')
[09:53:35] <Sendoushi> for the sake of the argument Velveeta :)
[09:53:42] <decx> Sendoushi http://jsperf.com/findvschildren/2
[09:53:45] <Sendoushi> of course 'el' is always better
[09:53:46] <Velveeta> ok, then for the sake of that argument, i would do $('body el')
[09:53:54] <Velveeta> for simplicity
[09:53:59] <Raydiation> or use angularjs
[09:54:00] <Sendoushi> decx: interesting...
[09:54:01] <Raydiation> ;D
[09:54:13] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi the second one will likely be faster.  but be smart with your markup, too - give el an ID and select the ID.
[09:54:14] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: so.. just for simplicity hmm
[09:54:16] <Raydiation> to stop binding your logic to dom structure
[09:54:25] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi it depends largely on the case.
[09:54:27] <Sendoushi> of course i know that duch_kazatel it was just for the sake of the argument :)
[09:54:38] <Velveeta> angular is all well and good, if you want to angular all the things
[09:54:48] <Velveeta> angular likes to be the only kid on the block when it comes to your application
[09:55:10] <Sendoushi> i like the framework we use :9
[09:55:11] <Sendoushi> :)
[09:55:18] <duch_kazatel> i like the looks of Riot.js personally.
[09:55:19] <skypce> please help me with this?
[09:55:22] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/DWKPxeJM
[09:55:43] <skypce> i want add background blue class to product
[09:55:47] <Sendoushi> we use spoonjs. a new kid on the block and well... i like it!
[09:55:49] <Velveeta> and angular likes to embed all kinds of garbage into the markup, so i wouldn't exactly say you're not binding your logic to the dom structure, so much as shifting it from the js you're physically writing, to the markup you're physically writing
[09:56:32] <decx> yeah that always seemed like a step back into <a onclick> territory
[09:56:43] <duch_kazatel> glad i'm not the only one that thinks that.
[09:57:01] <Velveeta> yeah i'm not big on that either... addy osmani has some good ideas on how to minimize that footprint by way of behavioral classes in addition to presentational classes
[09:57:24] <duch_kazatel> i feel like angular is trying hard to be web components without actually being web components
[09:57:45] <Velveeta> so you'd have a behavioral bindings object w/ certain keys in it, and on your html nodes, could specify class="presentation-classes" data-model="js-model" data-class="behavioral-bindings-class"
[09:58:09] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: well that's exactly what it's trying to do, is give people a way of using web components prior to the spec being finalized
[09:58:28] <duch_kazatel> it just seems... clunky?
[09:58:31] <Velveeta> they're finally starting to consume chunks of the polymer polyfills also, as part of that, where they used to roll their own solutions
[09:59:00] <duch_kazatel> yeah i saw the polymer stuff.
[09:59:20] <duch_kazatel> looked promising
[09:59:33] <Velveeta> yeah i like the look of it, just not the support matrix ;)
[09:59:37] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:59:42] <Velveeta> i won't be able to use that for another 5 years realistically
[09:59:59] <Velveeta> check out this bit from one of addy's books about design patterns: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvvm
[10:00:29] <Velveeta> he uses knockout for his examples, but if you scroll down a little bit to the "MVVM With Looser Data-Bindings" you'll see an implementation idea that makes me less nauseous :D
[10:01:17] <mehwork> $('#someId .someClass') means "find all descendants of #someId with a class of .someClass" right?
[10:01:32] <Velveeta> i have a rough implementation of it worked up in a side branch for my product at work, which allows for aggregate stacking of those data bindings so you can augment them at each layer of nested dom to get more fine-grained about their behavior if you need to
[10:01:38] <Sendoushi> mehwork: yeah
[10:01:44] <mehwork> thanks
[10:02:41] <duch_kazatel> i feel like we're getting a lot of basic selector questions lately in here.
[10:02:47] <Sendoushi> eeheh
[10:03:08] <mehwork> Sendoushi: for some reason when i do that with an on('click'  handler it works, but when i change it to on('tap' it doesn't
[10:03:13] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I have a small jquery project where I'm transitioning between 5 pages. I have a script on one of hte pages that doesn't work and doesn't log any errors if I go to it from the first page but If I go directly, it works. I'm not sure if it's something to do with how jquery is fetching the page but I've tried both prefetch caching true and false. Even things like popup don't work if I navigate to it from the first page.
[10:03:24] <Sendoushi> 'tap' ? is that a real event?
[10:03:32] <mehwork> Sendoushi: in jquery mobile
[10:03:35] <Sendoushi> oh
[10:03:53] <mehwork> doesn't work on the desktop though
[10:04:05] <Sendoushi> haaam... makes sense right?
[10:04:10] <mehwork> yeah but
[10:05:27] <mehwork> idk, i need to play with it more to figure out my exact bug
[10:05:31] <NoiseEee> are form elements values not duplicated/cloned when their parent is cloned??? http://jsfiddle.net/jCA94/1/
[10:06:12] <duch_kazatel> not that I'm aware of.
[10:06:18] <NoiseEee> but i want to clone.
[10:06:20] <NoiseEee> lol
[10:06:20] <NoiseEee> wtf
[10:06:27] <NoiseEee> 'give me everything the same'?
[10:06:31] <Sendoushi> i guess you'll have to store the values :P
[10:06:35] <NoiseEee> how retahded
[10:06:49] <Sendoushi> the duplicate only gets the markup
[10:07:00] <NoiseEee> but i mean, you can tell it to copy event handlers
[10:07:03] <Sendoushi> the values are not in the markup so...
[10:07:04] <NoiseEee> so why not go for broke?
[10:07:20] <Sendoushi> maybe because that is realllyyyyy specific :P
[10:07:25] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/clone/ - "For performance reasons, the dynamic state of form elements (e.g., user data typed into input, and textarea or user selections made to a select) is not copied to the cloned elements. The clone operation sets these fields to their default values as specified in the HTML."
[10:07:26] <NoiseEee> you think?
[10:07:35] <NoiseEee> thanks duch_kazatel.
[10:07:40] <NoiseEee> closed as 'retaheded'
[10:07:44] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:08:35] <duch_kazatel> it would be cool if there was a flag to copy values, too.
[10:09:27] <Velveeta> you're a flag
[10:09:35] <duch_kazatel> *gasp*
[10:09:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I made this thingie: https://gist.github.com/crswll/7905125
[10:09:52] * Velveeta runs around the room screaming "OHHHHHHHHH, HE CALLED HIM A FLAAAAG!"
[10:10:38] <duch_kazatel> ooh, neat.
[10:10:45] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell made a thing.
[10:11:46] <randomg> i have a quick question - what is the difference between doing a handler by id or a handler by 'this'
[10:11:58] <BillCriswell> populate( $('.cloned-form'), $('.original-form').serializeArray() ); I think is how it would be used
[10:12:06] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: HAha
[10:12:10] <duch_kazatel> randomg have an example?
[10:12:15] <ashgotti> ranomg: I believe "this" is a placeholder for different objects but by id restricts you to that ID
[10:12:50] <duch_kazatel> "this" is not a placeholder - think of "this" as more of a context.  depending on how you're handling your event binding, "this" could be all kinds of things.
[10:13:12] <randomg> i have a button that I click, if I do it with the it only handles the click once
[10:13:18] <randomg> with the ID
[10:13:19] <randomg> *
[10:13:28] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: sorry, placeholder is a much better word
[10:13:31] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[10:13:35] <randomg> if i do it with this it fires off once for every time I've pushd the button
[10:14:45] <rodd> Hi, I'd like to select and hide a label and its next sibling. According to the docs this is my approach: $('label[for="elementId"] + textarea').hide(); that hides only my textarea, what am I missing?
[10:16:00] <randomg> how do i save on jsbin
[10:16:11] <remysharp> randomg: you *type* - jsbin saves for you.
[10:16:25] <randomg> http://jsbin.com/fahap/1/edit
[10:16:35] <remysharp> boom
[10:16:42] <randomg> why does it keep spamming the message more times the more i click it
[10:16:47] <yurakeshi> $('label[for="elementId"]').hide().next('textarea').hide();
[10:16:49] <BillCriswell> remysharp: Do you have "jsbin" highlighted but not "jsbin.com"
[10:17:02] <BillCriswell> I imagine your IRC client blows up.
[10:17:33] <rodd> yurakeshi: thanks, wouldn't $('prev + next') do the same?
[10:17:36] <remysharp> BillCriswell: I have just "jsbin", but I'm not in that many channels. jquery is my old friend :)
[10:17:53] <duch_kazatel> randomg you've got an event handler that adds another event handler
[10:18:17] <randomg> hnnng
[10:18:23] <randomg> sec
[10:18:41] <BillCriswell> remysharp: Haha, nice.
[10:18:53] <BillCriswell> So you get a ping for every example I post, eh?
[10:19:00] <yurakeshi> rodd, i'm not sure, that's why i wrote in a form i know it works
[10:19:13] <remysharp> BillCriswell: I figure I might as well support my project. And yeah, but I'm learning to ignore a lot of it too.
[10:19:33] <BillCriswell> remysharp: Yeah you do a hell of a job with helping out general questions about it.
[10:20:18] <rodd> yurakeshi: alright thanks
[10:20:52] <BillCriswell> rodd: You could do $('prev, prev + next').hide() as well.
[10:21:46] <Jadenn> am having issue modifying an iframes sandbox attribute after it is generated by another jquery plugin
[10:21:50] <rodd> BillCriswell: cool, thanks
[10:22:17] <Jadenn> i vaguely recall jquery not being able to select things modified by javascript
[10:22:22] <Jadenn> how would i counteract this
[10:22:53] <BillCriswell> Jadenn: You just select it to match how you changed it.
[10:23:12] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn wat.  jquery is written in javascript.  not sure what you meant by that.
[10:23:27] <randomg> remysharp:
[10:23:28] <randomg> http://jsbin.com/fahap/3/edit
[10:23:37] <BillCriswell> If I have <div class="foo"></div> and I do $('div').attr('class', 'bar'); I'd have to select it with $('.bar') now.
[10:23:39] <Jadenn> does not work. $('iframe[src='url']").attr('sandbox','allow-forms'); does not work
[10:23:49] <Jadenn> err -'+"
[10:23:59] <randomg> i only want to do 'clicked' the first time and 'already clicked' the second
[10:24:27] <BillCriswell> randomg: Set a class like "clicked" after the first click.
[10:25:17] <NaN> any way to use "call" or "apply" for the function call with 'on' events? (I need to send context)
[10:25:33] <Jadenn> the iframe does not exist on the page, until it is added via a gallery plugin. i must have all but one iframe to allow scripts
[10:25:36] <BillCriswell> randomg: http://jsbin.com/fahap/6/edit?html,output
[10:26:12] <duch_kazatel> NaN huh?
[10:26:18] <Jadenn> 4 of the iframes require javascript to operate, and one will not operate with it
[10:26:33] <BillCriswell> NaN: Velveeta showed you using $.proxy, must have timedout.
[10:27:35] <BillCriswell> NaN: Here is what he posted: http://jsfiddle.net/jRL8n/6/
[10:28:23] <NaN> BillCriswell: oh sorry I miss my connection and didn't se it
[10:28:26] <NaN> let's see
[10:28:40] <BillCriswell> I can let it slide this time, NaN.
[10:28:56] <BillCriswell> Sweet just found a banana.
[10:29:20] <NaN> thanks Velveeta, BillCriswell
[10:29:29] <NaN> I will read about $.proxy
[10:30:13] <Jadenn> i hate to sound vexatious, however i have been trying to fix this for two days
[10:30:56] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn so you're trying to set the sandbox attribute on an iframe?
[10:31:03] <Jadenn> yes
[10:31:52] <BillCriswell> Some new HTML5 business. Never heard of that.
[10:32:24] <Jadenn> i am using a plugin called fancybox. I can set the iframes attributes, however i need all of the iframes in a gallery. if i use multiple instances of the fancybox, they cannot be in the same group
[10:32:52] <Jadenn> as i said, 4 require javascript, and one tries to deny iframes, which is why i need to disable javascript
[10:33:08] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn then create each iframe separately and set the sandbox attribute as needed.
[10:33:42] <Jadenn> they need to be in a group. i cannot set them seperately. which is why i am trying to select it with jquery after the fact to modify the attribute
[10:35:28] <duch_kazatel> i've used fancybox before - you should be able to create each iframe separately.  changing the sandbox attribute after creating the iframe might not do you any good.
[10:35:44] <Jadenn> *they need to be in the same group*
[10:35:57] <Jadenn> they will not operate in the same group if instantiated seperately
[10:36:17] <duch_kazatel> not instantiated separately.  you're conflating the two actions.
[10:36:48] <BillCriswell> "conflating", good word
[10:37:06] <Jadenn> please elaborate on creating them seperately.
[10:39:10] <PenguinMan98> I'm trying to make a multiple autocomplete field work with jquery
[10:39:14] <Jadenn> if i set the attributes seperately like so http://puu.sh/6Sitt.png they will not group together
[10:39:48] <PenguinMan98> I added the code to my page and this is the result: http://screencast.com/t/6yvIQHHwKl
[10:39:59] <PenguinMan98> Can anybody help me troubleshoot?
[10:40:25] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Do you have jQuery UI stylesheet loaded?
[10:41:34] <PenguinMan98> Yes, I believe so: http://screencast.com/t/rxkTjKNIGk
[10:41:55] <PenguinMan98> or wait..
[10:42:00] <PenguinMan98> is that thing commented out?
[10:42:13] <Jadenn> that censor tho
[10:42:40] <PenguinMan98> forgive me. I'm nervous
[10:42:54] <jedimind> lol
[10:42:59] <jedimind> why are you nervous
[10:43:16] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: Yes. That looks to be the case. No reason to be nervous here.
[10:44:06] <Jadenn> freenode attracts rather illicit individuals
[10:44:08] <PenguinMan98> Yes that fixed it. Thank you so much!
[10:44:29] * PenguinMan98 wonders which idiot commented that out...
[10:44:52] <PenguinMan98> *is a joke. PenguinMan98  is the only dev on this project*
[10:44:56] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: No problem!
[10:46:03] <Jadenn> must have been a PEBKAC
[10:46:17] <PenguinMan98> Yep.  Time to execute the programmer
[10:47:26] <Jadenn> duch_kazatel: what should my next course of action be?
[10:47:49] <Jadenn> i am between the proverbial rock and hard place it appears
[10:51:52] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i stepped away.
[10:54:42] <duch_kazatel> i didn't read everything you put Jadenn, but the basic idea is to build out the modal content as you'd like it to display, then use that as the content proper.
[10:56:03] <Jadenn> tl;dr the only way i can i would be able to have my cake and eat it too is to select the iframe via src and change its attribute
[10:56:43] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[10:56:44] <duch_kazatel> good times.
[10:56:56] <Jadenn> otherwise i would have to either sacrifice the webpage which will not operate with javascript, or to not have it in the group (which defeats the purpose)
[10:57:09] <Jadenn> both of which are not viable at this point
[10:57:49] <randomg> complete side track
[10:57:53] <duch_kazatel> so why are you embedding a page that doesn't want to be embedded?
[10:57:59] <randomg> has anyone had ramen with kielbasa boiled into it
[10:58:21] <BillCriswell> randomg: Sounds pretty incredible.
[10:58:38] <randomg> i was looking for an easy snack, and i had ramen but it felt boring
[10:59:13] <randomg> so I tossed in a few diced onion pieces, about an inch of kielbasa cut in quarter inch crescents, and a clove of garlic and an egg
[10:59:16] <Jadenn> its for a client. its a portal page which contains a "vote" button for their minecraft server. it brings up a gallery of voting websites in iframes, including the errant PlanetMinecraft
[10:59:31] <randomg> +1 for $1 restaurant meals
[11:00:38] <duch_kazatel> randomg shoulda sauteed the sausage, minced garlic, and onion
[11:01:14] <randomg> duch_kazatel: i would have, but I was looking for a three minute meal
[11:01:20] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[11:01:26] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn that's... sketch.
[11:01:27] <randomg> if I was going that far, I probably wouldn't have used ramen, and certainly not the flavor pack
[11:01:44] <duch_kazatel> iframing content from somebody who doesn't want it iframed?
[11:01:48] <Jadenn> it's all the rage with minecraft servers now adays.
[11:02:22] <BillCriswell> Still trying to understand Minecraft.
[11:03:23] <Jadenn> well, PlanetMinecraft don't need to be abberant pricks
[11:04:02] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:04:20] <Jadenn> i believe it is called a publicity stunt?
[11:04:22] <Sypris> Hello, has anyone played with Twitter Typeahead that I could ask a few questions?
[11:04:26] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[11:08:05] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/dx9DcjDw
[11:08:26] <skypce> hello guys , what is wrong with this code pleasE? the bgblue class doesnt applied
[11:08:41] <duch_kazatel> skypce could you create a functioning example in jsfiddle?
[11:08:47] <Jadenn> this is why i never use javascript. it is terribly unreliable.
[11:08:58] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:09:19] <duch_kazatel> I've built plenty of reliable javascript over the years.
[11:09:42] <duch_kazatel> it's a tool like HTML and CSS>
[11:11:08] <jsharpminor> Trying to get 2 radio inputs to mirror each other. http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/eFKV8/2/ When 1 is changed, the 2nd should change as well.
[11:11:16] <jsharpminor> But nothing happens.
[11:12:23] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor you have a syntax error.
[11:13:16] <BillCriswell> Ugh. I have a bug on a 5S but not a 5.
[11:13:18] <duch_kazatel> also, you're targeting an ID, not a name
[11:13:52] <jsharpminor> duch_kazatel: I know I have a syntax error. What I don't know is where. I'm very new to jQuery, I've not done much besides PHP before.
[11:13:59] <yurakeshi> skypce, maybe like this: http://pastebin.com/JiZfWfcg
[11:14:11] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor you have a missing closing paren after that closing curly.
[11:14:25] <jsharpminor> Got that. Still doesnt work though
[11:14:30] <skypce> very thank you yurakeshi
[11:14:38] <jsharpminor> And thank you btw
[11:14:41] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor look at my second comment - you're targeting an ID.
[11:14:45] <duch_kazatel> not a name.
[11:15:07] <jsharpminor> could it be that simple...?
[11:15:10] * jsharpminor goes to fiddle more
[11:15:55] <NaN> is it safer or better to atach all my 'on' events to document instead to each selector? (appart to chain .on)
[11:16:13] <duch_kazatel> NaN using event delegation?
[11:16:28] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/eFKV8/4/
[11:17:02] <jsharpminor> hang on, I think that's borked as well
[11:17:13] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor you can only use an ID once.
[11:17:44] <NaN> duch_kazatel: isn't $(document).on('click', 'selector', function)... event delegation?
[11:18:07] <duch_kazatel> NaN it is, but you should bind to event sfurther down.
[11:18:11] <duch_kazatel> *elements further down
[11:18:14] <duch_kazatel> instead of on document
[11:18:54] <NaN> so it's better to attach event to each selector > $('selector').on('click', function(){});
[11:18:54] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/eFKV8/2/
[11:19:01] <duch_kazatel> nan no
[11:19:17] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', 'child', function(){});
[11:19:59] <NaN> why 'parent' and 'child' if selector could do it?
[11:20:00] <duch_kazatel> instead of to Document, which'll have to sift through every, say, click to figure out if it should act or not.
[11:20:27] <duch_kazatel> because that way you're binding one handler that can handle all children, instead of a bunch of children.
[11:20:30] <duch_kazatel> depends on the use case.
[11:20:37] <jsharpminor> yurakeshi, yep, that's illegal. I think this is better? http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/eFKV8/7/
[11:21:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/eFKV8/8/ - with jquery enabled
[11:21:28] <NaN> duch_kazatel: some are specific elements, without childs
[11:21:47] <PenguinMan98> I realize this is more of a pure javascript question but: If I set an onsubmit function that changes the values in a form, can I guarantee that those changes will be completed before the server request is sent?
[11:21:51] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/eFKV8/10/
[11:21:57] <jop008> I have a relative simple page can be found here  http://www.happyaway.nl/surface.htm  http://picpaste.com/ScreenShot-n0MBcyZB.jpg
[11:21:58] <jsharpminor> Right. Enabling jQuiery always helps.
[11:21:58] <jop008> page looks fine in Safari, chrome, FF but sucks in IE9
[11:22:07] <jop008> any idea how to debug this?
[11:22:15] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, what is illegal?
[11:22:24] <duch_kazatel> NaN without delegation, would you be binding a lot of different handlers?
[11:23:01] <NaN> duch_kazatel: yes, that's why I tought it could be ok to handle all the events to 'document'
[11:23:34] <jsharpminor> yurakeshi: having 3 duplicate IDs.
[11:23:35] <NoiseEee> NaN: surely you have elements that confine certain handlers/actions
[11:23:47] <duch_kazatel> NaN it can be, but it's a little smarter to bind a little further down.
[11:24:31] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, it's not Ids, it's names.
[11:24:44] <NaN> duch_kazatel: little further down, but not the exact element, isn't?
[11:25:12] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, radio names must be the same, that's what's called a group
[11:25:24] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, take a look at the example i send, it's working
[11:25:39] * Velveeta throws a brick through the window and runs off... When you unwrap the note from around it, it simply reads "SOON".
[11:26:04] <duch_kazatel> NaNhttp://jsfiddle.net/KLW8p/
[11:26:08] <duch_kazatel> woops  - NaN http://jsfiddle.net/KLW8p/
[11:26:17] <PenguinMan98>  I realize this is more of a pure javascript question but: If I set an onsubmit function that changes the values in a form, can I guarantee that those changes will be completed before the server request is sent?
[11:26:21] <duch_kazatel> instead of binding to document, bind to a lower parent element.
[11:26:26] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use delegation.
[11:26:51] <duch_kazatel> PenguinMan98 if you cancel the original submit and then resubmit when you're done.
[11:27:19] <jop008> I think it happens when I expand a collapsible field set in IE 8 or IE9
[11:27:24] <jsharpminor> yurakeshi: Oh. Okay, I'm looking... but it  doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[11:27:28] <jop008> then the page looks weird
[11:28:00] <yurakeshi> jsharpminor, sorry, forgot to update it... http://jsfiddle.net/yevLr/
[11:28:10] <Velveeta> penguinman98: or you could write your code so that it doesn't matter... ajax-trasmit your variables and assign those variable values to the form fields... since you're specifying the data directly as part of your ajax request, it won't matter if the UI is updated at the time the request is sent or not
[11:28:22] <jsharpminor> Oh. Wow.
[11:28:24] <jsharpminor> Thanks.
[11:29:16] <PenguinMan98> kk.  I understand. Thanks!
[11:33:54] <NaN> duch_kazatel: I'll try it, thanks...
[11:33:55] <NaN> :)
[11:35:07] <duch_kazatel> NaN the idea is that you want to bind your listener as far down as possible.  otherwise you're doing a bunch of extra work for each time that event is triggered.
[11:38:37] <NaN> duch_kazatel: well but as far down could be the exact element, so why not just use the element itself?
[11:39:29] <skypce> guys i have a div > div > div i want activate hover when clicked in parent div , how can i enable hover attribute ?
[11:40:39] <PenguinMan98> @ skypce : .. what?  You want to activate a 'hover' with a 'click'?
[11:40:49] <duch_kazatel> NaN it depends entirely on the context.
[11:40:59] <duch_kazatel> NaN are you binding a bunch of event handlers?
[11:41:55] <skypce> PenguinMan98, no i want change the hover state to parent div
[11:43:18] <skypce> PenguinMan98, when i hover in parent div , the div > div show me the hover

[11:48:50] <duch_kazatel> surround them in quotes.
[11:50:01] <NaN> duch_kazatel: like 9 or 10
[11:50:30] <duch_kazatel> NaN and I'll bet they're all doing basically the same thing, right?  firing on a click, doing similar stuff?
[11:50:57] <NaN> duch_kazatel: mostly yes
[11:51:02] <duch_kazatel> in that case, use delegation, but bind as low as is reasonable in the document.
[11:51:27] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you'll mitigate the benefits of using delegation.
[11:52:50] <NaN> duch_kazatel: I need to know those benefits because I still think about ussing specific selector :/

[12:11:05] <duch_kazatel> nezZario does .foo exist when the pag3e loads?
[12:11:16] <nezZario> I was just about to add, the content is ajax'd in
[12:11:22] <nezZario> Is there anything special I have to do?
[12:11:58] <nezZario> ahh, works when I move it to the .done(function() { .. }); bit
[12:12:17] <nezZario> so .on(..,..) is actually applied as it's ran, and isn't retroactive?
[12:12:26] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:12:33] <nezZario> no to which
[12:12:35] <duch_kazatel> on only binds to elements that exist at time of binding.
[12:12:39] <nezZario> ok
[12:12:42] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[12:12:42] <nezZario> i did not know that
[12:12:49] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: example?
[12:12:56] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', 'child', function(){});
[12:14:23] <duch_kazatel> the parent needs to exist on pageload.
[12:14:26] <duch_kazatel> child is your target element
[12:15:13] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: is there anything inheriently bad habit about putting the binding in the .done() of the ajax?
[12:15:39] <duch_kazatel> you'll bind every time the ajax runs.
[12:15:41] <duch_kazatel> that's bad :)
[12:15:47] <duch_kazatel> you'll bind mutliple times
[12:17:08] <nezZario> what happens if it's a billion levels deep from what's not ajaxed?
[12:17:13] <nezZario> well let me test this..
[12:18:42] <duch_kazatel> still smart to leverege the delegation.
[12:18:47] <duch_kazatel> don't bind events unnecessarily
[12:19:58] <nezZario> i'm just confused how im' suppose to use this
[12:20:16] <duch_kazatel> nezZario events bubble up through the document.
[12:20:47] <nezZario> i.e. say I have <div id="foo">{ajaxed} data</div> ... within the ajax'd data I have {bunch of stuff} <ul><li class="clickable"><span>..</span></li></ul>
[12:20:50] <jsharpminor> Whoever posted this -- http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide12 -- thank you ever so much. You made my life complete.
[12:21:05] <duch_kazatel> so you could even use this: $(document).on('click', '.foo', function() { alert('test'); });
[12:21:29] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: what's the proper way?
[12:21:55] <duch_kazatel> using event delegation is smarter.
[12:22:12] <nezZario> also, what about .delegate() vs .on() ?
[12:22:17] <duch_kazatel> use .on();
[12:22:21] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: i understand that, i'm just trying to get proper usage
[12:22:31] <jsharpminor> NoiseEee --- thank you. You're a hero.
[12:22:39] <nezZario> you said use $('.parent').on('click', 'child', function() {}});
[12:22:44] <duch_kazatel> nezZario also, from the jquery docs "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. "
[12:22:56] <nezZario> in my example, what is the closest parent and what is the closet child?
[12:23:01] <jsharpminor> Oh, and duch_kazatel -- thanks to you too. You pulled me out of a frustrating pit.
[12:23:01] <nezZario> is parent foo or the ul?
[12:23:09] <nezZario> or should it be, rather
[12:23:14] <duch_kazatel> parent is whatever container that exists on pageload.
[12:23:18] <nezZario> i guess it would need to be foo since it exists
[12:23:22] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[12:23:36] <nezZario> ok, and it doesn't matter about elements "between" parent and child, it doesn't have to be a direct ancestor?
[12:23:43] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:23:49] <nezZario> ok, that's what I needed :)
[12:23:59] <duch_kazatel> because the event bubbles up all the way to the document unless stopped explicitly.
[12:24:34] <complexity> i was able to get the slider to actually work, just the text wont show now because of the conflict of jquery and jquery min :(
[12:24:59] <duch_kazatel> complexity wat?  only include one or the other.
[12:25:00] <duch_kazatel> not both
[12:25:51] <complexity> i need them both or both the scripts i need wont function
[12:25:57] <complexity> http://www.partoutpost.com/store/
[12:26:02] <complexity> the live chat and the banner
[12:26:07] <duch_kazatel> then you've got something terribly broken.
[12:26:11] <duch_kazatel> they both do the exact same thing.
[12:26:29] <duch_kazatel> hand including both will cause far more problems than they'd potentially solve.
[12:27:48] <complexity> $(function(){$("<link>").attr({href: "http://www.partoutpost.com/live_chat/templates/css/live_chat.css", rel: "stylesheet"}).appendTo("head");$("body").append($("<div>").load("/live_chat/live_chat.php",function(){live_chat("/live_chat/");}));});</script>
[12:27:49] <afib>  hey everyone! i'm trying to pass a hover event through to an underlying element with jQ but i can't quite figure it out... basically i have an image which partially overlays a menu. to allow the pointer to hover over the menu and be able to click it, i used CSS pointer-events:none ... that works fine in Chrome and Firefox and recent IE, but not IE 9 and 10 since they only allow it for SVG
[12:27:49] <afib> elements. so i tried to use the same thing i used for clicking: find pos, quickly hide the element, pass the click through, and show the element...
[12:27:56] <complexity> that line of code wont function without min?
[12:27:59] <duch_kazatel> `paste
[12:27:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:28:06] <bdoherty> Could anyone explain to me why iterating over a larger list of elements and performing a callback function is faster than just a straight up :contains? These results are surprising to me and my co0workers
[12:28:07] <complexity> sorry
[12:28:07] <bdoherty> http://jsperf.com/more-specfic-selectors-with-contains
[12:28:58] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty because it's faster to enumerate through a list than rely on sizzle to do stuff.
[12:29:06] <duch_kazatel> sizzle is slow for certain operatiopns.
[12:29:09] <vru> Hello! Does anyone know if there are any limitation on the number of object properties that can be iterated by the each-method?
[12:29:10] <afib> but yeah that's not working. i can't get the hover to pass through
[12:29:49] <afib> and it's a CSS hover, i don't see any hover class that i can use
[12:29:55] <bdoherty> Is sizzle doing the :contains logic as well? I was always under the assumption that :contains just aliased to something like the $(this).text() == 'blah' operation in the callback.
[12:30:03] <duch_kazatel> nope
[12:30:07] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty if you want even faster, try a native for loop
[12:30:30] <bdoherty> i'll add a test case for fun
[12:30:47] <duch_kazatel> was about to do the same.
[12:31:19] <duch_kazatel> but sizzle is slow.  same reason why using $('.parent .child'); is slower than $('.parent').find('.child');
[12:31:27] <petey> Anyone have any recommendations for a plugin that allows you to put on an image, place some "hotspots" on it and when you click over the hotspot a textbox shows up?
[12:31:29] <petey> Does that make sense?
[12:31:43] <duch_kazatel> you mean tooltips?
[12:32:20] <duch_kazatel> http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/ - this in conjunction with some simple markup should serve you quite well.
[12:32:31] <petey> Yes yes thanks!
[12:32:34] <petey> Sorry my brain is fried.
[12:32:47] <complexity> http://pastebin.com/ixjsBUyq
[12:32:54] <complexity> why isn't that code working now that i removed the min
[12:33:06] <afib> guess not =/
[12:33:16] <duch_kazatel> complexity are you using different version of jquery?
[12:33:30] <bdoherty> hm, i always thought sizzle was an engine that would do the lookup of elements if the document.querySelector function didn't exist. Otherwise I thought jQuery just used the native lookup.
[12:33:33] <duch_kazatel> afib could you fiddle your question?
[12:33:52] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty some selectors require a manual parse.
[12:33:55] <complexity> duch_kazatel: it is called twice. i removed the smaller one
[12:34:13] <duch_kazatel> complexity and you've got it in the head, above all your other scripts, right?
[12:34:20] <afib> yeah i can try
[12:34:28] <complexity> yup
[12:34:46] <complexity> <script type="text/javascript" src="includes/templates/theme653/jscript/jscript_jquery-1.6.4.js"></script>
[12:34:53] <complexity> right in the header
[12:35:10] <duch_kazatel> complexity that's a pretty old version of jquery
[12:35:29] <nezZario> ok
[12:35:33] <nezZario> thanks duch_kazatel I got it working
[12:35:44] <duch_kazatel> nezZario cool
[12:35:59] <nezZario> one other Q, if I have a whatever.html() and it returns <span>data</span> .. how do I grab only 'data' out?
[12:36:14] <complexity> well if i upgrade it
[12:36:20] <complexity> i'm sure that will cause a bunch more issues
[12:36:41] <duch_kazatel> complexity you should never run more than one copy of jquery at a time.
[12:36:42] <bdoherty> duch_kazatel, apparently I'm dumb and can't figure out how to do the native for loop, by all means if you want to demonstrate something, go for it.
[12:36:54] <bdoherty> http://jsperf.com/more-specfic-selectors-with-contains
[12:36:54] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty kworking on it now.
[12:36:55] <complexity> been trying to figure this out for six hours
[12:37:12] <vru> nezZario: instead of html() just text()?
[12:37:31] <vru> Does anyone know if there are any limitations on the number of object properties that can be iterated by the each-method? For my purposes, an object with ~2500 attributes get iterated, but the one with 6500 attributes fails?
[12:37:33] <nezZario> ahh.. I was unware of text()
[12:37:36] <nezZario> Thanks again!
[12:38:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jsperf.com/more-specfic-selectors-with-contains/3
[12:38:53] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty ^^
[12:40:02] <duch_kazatel> and vru woah....  might want to try either splitting things up a little, or change to a native for ans see if that works.
[12:40:11] <bdoherty> thanks duch_kazatel, i learned something today.
[12:40:26] <duch_kazatel> bdoherty basically, stay out of jquery land unless you really need it :)
[12:41:12] <vru> duch_kazatel: I will test (http://stackoverflow.com/a/921808/319679) and I hope the native js will work
[12:41:53] <duch_kazatel> vru that's one way.  your data sounds excessive.  why are you shipping such a large object around?
[12:42:38] <complexty> does anyone have any idea how i can make this work, or why the chat isn't coming up once i remove the smaller file of jquery
[12:42:54] <duch_kazatel> complexty link to the site again?
[12:43:04] <NoiseEee> this .clone() thing with lack of input values is killing my day
[12:43:35] <vru> duch_kazatel: I have an instance of Apache Solr containing a lot of stuff and I need to do some text mining. Therefore, I have to query for ~20 MB of JSON data and then do some magic to get term frequency and other natural language processing stuff :)
[12:43:51] <duch_kazatel> holy shit.  you might want to move some of that server-side if possible.
[12:43:54] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty extreme
[12:44:24] <complexty> http://www.partoutpost.com/store/
[12:45:04] <duch_kazatel> complexty you're not running that in noconflict mode or anything, right?
[12:45:14] <duch_kazatel> and what was the old url you had in there instead?
[12:46:56] <duch_kazatel> complexty either way, your entire setups is way screwy.  you've got a lot mor problems than just two versions of jquery.
[12:47:39] <vru> duch_kazatel: I know that it is not a very good approach, but it is only for a prototype for a master thesis. Server side processing would of course be more elegant, but I wanted to directly access the data in Apache Solr. And I have other analyses running over Ajax already, so I wanted to stay consistent ;)
[12:48:45] <duch_kazatel> javascript has a limit of around 65535 properties per object.
[12:48:46] <duch_kazatel> soooo...
[12:49:13] <duch_kazatel> you're going to have a hell of a time working around that.
[12:49:22] <duch_kazatel> it's not that's not a very good approach, it's that it's an unreasonable approach.
[12:49:45] <Velveeta> gotta go for a bit, playing host machine to a webinar for the next hour
[12:49:50] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaay
[12:50:47] <vru> duch_kazatel: I have seen this number, but there were also posts with the Integer.MaxValue. So I am pretty optimistic. Well I will try the native JS approach and will give you a feedback
[12:51:39] <duch_kazatel> you're making a mistake imo.
[12:51:41] <duch_kazatel> but good luck.
[12:52:36] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[12:53:01] <|RicharD|> How I can trigger when  user is scrolling(or use bottom button of keyboard)
[12:53:18] <|RicharD|> also if is on the end of page(so the browser not is scrolling)
[12:53:19] <|RicharD|> ?
[12:53:55] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('scroll', function(){});
[12:54:41] <vru_> duch_kazatel: works like a charm! native JS: 1, jquery: 0. At least for this requirement
[12:55:30] <Paladine> hey duch_kazatel  - I am trying another way and I can't get that to work either - forget the clicks at the moment just look at the main animation - why when it goes back to the first slide does it go straight to the second one without the 5s pause? http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/12/
[12:55:44] <duch_kazatel> |RicharD| the event doesn't fire when the user tries to scroll down after they're at the bottom of the page.
[12:56:19] <duch_kazatel> Paladine huh?
[12:56:26] <duch_kazatel> Paladine you mean why doesn't it "wait"?
[12:56:42] <Paladine> well it slides back to slide 1 then goes immediately to slide2 without any pause
[12:56:48] <duch_kazatel> let's take a look.
[12:56:54] <Paladine> should be 5 seconds between each slide
[12:57:07] <complexty> duch_kazatel: nah i tried that earlier
[12:57:43] <duch_kazatel> Paladine look at your code.
[12:57:59] <complexty> duch_kazatel: did you see that code I linked you to, i just need that to popup
[12:58:14] <duch_kazatel> complexty no, because you've got bigger problems.
[12:58:51] <complexty> duch_kazatel: its a new site. doesn't every site have problems
[12:59:23] <duch_kazatel> complexty you should never include more than one copy of jquery on a page.
[12:59:58] <complexty> duch_kazatel: i took out the other copy
[13:00:01] <duch_kazatel> Paladine you've basically created a scenario where the gets set to one, then you immediately increment and animate again.
[13:00:15] <complexty> and now this simple line wont work
[13:00:31] <duch_kazatel> complexty i'll take a quick poke.  link?
[13:01:02] <|RicharD|> duch_kazatel: and how I can measure the "pressure"
[13:01:10] <|RicharD|> of the user scrolling ?
[13:01:15] <duch_kazatel> |RicharD| huh?
[13:01:19] <duch_kazatel> you mean velocity?
[13:01:21] <|RicharD|> yes
[13:01:31] <|RicharD|> at the bottom of page always
[13:01:46] <duch_kazatel> you cannot at the bottom of the page because there is no scrolling happening.
[13:01:56] <complexty> http://www.partoutpost.com/store
[13:02:32] <duch_kazatel> complexty you don't have lightbox or easing setup.
[13:02:55] <complexty> http://pastebin.com/2d6YW3bg
[13:03:02] <complexty> and that's the code that wont work if i take out the other j query
[13:03:03] <|RicharD|> and in other place ?
[13:03:05] <complexty> right
[13:03:36] <duch_kazatel> complexty just add it to the site instead of through javascript.
[13:04:04] <duch_kazatel> |RicharD| you need a plugin - what exactly is your end goal?
[13:04:20] <|RicharD|> I'M DOING an animation
[13:04:27] <|RicharD|> related to scrolling
[13:04:34] <complexty> duch_kazatel: the live chat thing, the way it is, is pretty common, i'd rather keep it like that
[13:05:09] <duch_kazatel> complexty I gave you your fix.  either do it or wait for somebody else :)
[13:05:15] <exalt> Hello is it posible to mimic a iframe in a div with jquery ?
[13:05:21] <duch_kazatel> |RicharD| like a parralax scroll?
[13:05:28] <|RicharD|> Yeah
[13:05:46] <duch_kazatel> |RicharD| - http://www.desiznworld.com/2013/07/free-jquery-parallax-scrolling-plugins.html
[13:05:50] <duch_kazatel> pick one, done :)
[13:05:51] <|RicharD|> Like superscrollarama
[13:05:53] <|RicharD|> but more simple
[13:05:59] <exalt> like when links in a specific div are clicked they load only inside the specific div ?
[13:06:12] <duch_kazatel> exalt you can do ajax.
[13:06:36] <exalt> duch_kazatel: yea probably good idea
[13:13:08] <complexty> willing to pay for a fix to my problem, message me.
[13:20:10] <yurakeshi> who was doing the carrousel thing?
[13:21:56] <yurakeshi> i don't know anymore, but here's a working version: http://jsfiddle.net/t7PBc/1/
[13:22:06] <yurakeshi> complexty, what's ur problem son?
[13:23:34] <complexty> yurakeshi, i have a popup that wontw ork
[13:23:41] <complexty> without having two different versions of j query in
[13:26:04] <yurakeshi> i looked at the piece of code, and i'd try it like this: http://pastebin.com/SHarSEyk
[13:27:11] <vru_> complexty: is it possible to see the problem "live"?
[13:29:28] <rainabba> I was getting a huge page load lag and just found that jquery is trying to load ui-bg_highlight-hard_100_f2f5f7_1x100.png from my my site. Chrome Dev Tools literally reports the request as coming from jquery.min.js. Is it actually a result of a jQuery UI .css being loaded by jquery or something like that? What's going on?
[13:29:40] <complexty> yurakeshi: that code still doesn't work, and the problem live is that the text in the slider doesn't show up
[13:30:41] <duch_kazatel> http://www.partoutpost.com/store/ this was complexty's site
[13:33:25] <yurakeshi> complexty, the text should appear in <div class="bnr1"></div> ?
[13:33:50] <obert> yurakeshi: the text should appears inside a p or a h* :p
[13:33:59] <complexty> yes
[13:34:36] <yurakeshi> but there is not text there, where do u set it?
[13:38:33] <yurakeshi> the progbar is always changing and the banners divs area always hidden... if you set display: block they will show
[13:38:39] <rainabba> I only need the themeRoller if I want a custom jqueryUI theme right? Is there a standard way to programatically select a theme from the provided resources from the jqueryUI.zip so it can be changed on the fly via a UI I give the user?
[13:40:21] <rainabba> I feel like I'm missing something VERY basic (and thus quite likely)
[13:40:29] <rainabba> s/likely/obvious
[13:40:32] <yurakeshi> rainabba http://www.jquery4u.com/page-layout/10-simple-easy-jquery-style-switchers/
[13:41:03] <rainabba> ty
[13:41:42] <yurakeshi> mama, i'm going home!
[13:41:43] <yurakeshi> seeya
[13:42:57] <rainabba> Wow. There's no built in way to change change the current theme? I know how to much with style-sheets but that seems pretty overkill when I actually have a UI layer with themes.
[13:45:02] <duch_kazatel> rainabba you could apply overrides for each theme
[13:46:17] <rainabba> duch_kazatel: I'm just looking to use the provided files, as-is and be able to switch between the existing, pre-defined themes rather than have to select a particular one for my site or muck around with loading other resources. The provided ui.js and ui.css contain all the standard themes right?
[13:46:33] <duch_kazatel> no idea - i'm not familiar with jqueryUI.
[13:46:48] <duch_kazatel> rather - I know very little about it.
[13:47:21] <complexty> so nobody has an iedeas
[13:47:24] <rainabba> duch_kazatel: Okay. Thanks. To clarify, I'm not asking a general JS or jQuery question though. I asking specifically about jQueryUI.
[13:47:40] <duch_kazatel> that's why I said I'm not familiar with jqueryUI.
[13:47:43] <coderego> should i learn javascript before i learn jquery?
[13:47:48] <duch_kazatel> coderego yes
[13:47:55] <rainabba> coderego: You can't use jQuery unless you know JS
[13:47:56] <duch_kazatel> coderego or learn them hand in hand
[13:49:13] <vru_> complexty: I mean if you open the website, you get 4 JS errors. That's a good starting point getting rid of them all?
[13:49:38] <complexty> i just made them when i was playing around with this.
[13:49:40] <rainabba> Ahh, I see where my confusion is. jQueryUI only provides a stock theme and you must obtain the additional themes separately and they all provide their own .js/.css/images. That makes more sense.
[13:49:42] <complexty> trying to figure it out
[13:50:03] <rainabba> vru_: Unless those 4 just mask many more. No way to know realisticly.
[13:50:47] <vru_> rainabba: no, no, of course there could be more :) The only thing I don't get is the selector '<link>' ?
[13:51:53] <rainabba> vru_: Ahh. Didn't catch that :)
[13:55:27] <vru_> complexty: could you describe the error again? Or what should happen and does not?
[13:56:06] <complexty> vru_: i just need the live chat to be able to work without loading j query twice
[13:58:06] <vru_> complexty: and if you only leave the old 1.6.x version? Are there any conflicts?
[13:58:30] <complexty> no
[13:58:38] <andrewanderson> http://bpaste.net/show/9j0iDzoyc8sV3ga4Hwkj/ i'm having trouble adding something to an object
[13:59:00] <andrewanderson> it doesn't add anything when i read the variable in console
[13:59:22] <vru_> complexty: sooooo, why don't you do it? I feel like I am missing an error...
[13:59:48] <bdoherty> andrewanderson, it looks like your trying to set a key in the statuses object that is a jQuery obj?
[14:00:09] <complexty> vru_: because then the javascript
[14:00:19] <BillCriswell> andrewanderson: Yeah, what bdoherty said... Not sure what your goal is here.
[14:00:21] <vru_> andrewanderson: whats that? $($( this ).attr("value")) - why the outer $()?
[14:00:22] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, finally getting somewhere - http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/16/  < everything works now but I want the "click" on the left to be invisible on the first slide and the "click" on the right to be invisible on the last slide - I can do it when the slide is in automatic mode but I can't seem to make it work if I manually go to the first and last slide using the "clicks"
[14:00:24] <complexty> doesn't work with the chat at the bottom, doesn't pop up
[14:00:32] <andrewanderson> i'm new to javascript so i'm probably doing everything weird
[14:00:49] <BillCriswell> andrewanderson: What are you trying to keep in statuses?
[14:00:50] <bdoherty> Try doing:
[14:00:55] <duch_kazatel> Paladine you'll have to check within the click handlers.
[14:01:00] <bdoherty> item = $(this).val();
[14:01:03] <bdoherty> $(this).show()
[14:01:06] <bdoherty> on two seperate lines
[14:01:09] <andrewanderson> this.attribute("value") is supposed to return an id.. i'm trying to use the same id as a key
[14:01:41] <bdoherty> $(this).val() == the value attribute
[14:01:56] <BillCriswell> andrewanderson: That seems odd, but item will be a jQuery object. You'd need to do like statuses[$(this).val()] = 1
[14:02:03] <andrewanderson> what's the difference when i do this.attribute("value"
[14:02:05] <andrewanderson> oops
[14:02:19] <andrewanderson> you get where i was going anyway
[14:02:19] <bdoherty> $(this).val() is a convience
[14:02:45] <andrewanderson> now it says no such item to show
[14:03:02] <bdoherty> so replace "item.show()" with "$(this).show()"
[14:03:04] <vru_> complexty: can you shortly describe for what reason you have two versions of jquery? New one for the chat window (otherwise it does not open?). And the old one?
[14:03:25] <bdoherty> $(this) == whatever element you clicked on
[14:03:52] <jcubic> better var item = $(this).show().val();
[14:04:06] <andrewanderson> it's not the same element.. it goes <div value="#id"></div> and then that #id is <img id="#id">
[14:04:10] <complexty> the new j query comes with this chat plugin
[14:04:31] <complexty> that's what makes it work, using min
[14:04:33] <bdoherty> you shouldn't have more than one element on the page with teh same id
[14:04:44] <andrewanderson> it doesn't
[14:05:33] <andrewanderson> it was passing the value="id for the image", then selecting that <img id="same id"> to show
[14:06:23] <bdoherty> So what is the satuses object for?
[14:07:16] <andrewanderson> to record if that image is shown, so that in a different page it i can run a loop to show the images again.. it's a bunch of transparency layers
[14:07:41] <andrewanderson> i guess i can just use two variables, one of the object and one of the show
[14:07:59] <andrewanderson> but isn't there a prettier way
[14:09:03] <bdoherty> andrewandweson, maybe this?
[14:09:04] <bdoherty> http://bpaste.net/show/GTDUcriV3c8YDBYRP4GA/
[14:09:10] <vru_> complexty: from your more then unuseful description, I can only guess that you could remove the new jquery version and add the migrate plugin to the old jquery version (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/). And perhaps you have luck and everything starts working
[14:10:38] <BillCriswell> andrewanderson: http://jsbin.com/zomif/2/edit also came up with this if it's useful to you
[14:10:48] <andrewanderson> wow guys, thanks
[14:11:01] <andrewanderson> i'll put it in my stuff and see if it works! thanks!
[14:13:59] <andrewanderson> didn't work bdoherty, and your code seems perfectly fine :s
[14:14:47] <bdoherty> what doesn't seem to be working? are the images not showing, the statuses object not updating? Is the image_id not being set properly from $(this).val() ?
[14:15:14] <andrewanderson> image isn't showing, and the status object is still empty
[14:15:24] <bdoherty> are you sure your callback is being fired?
[14:15:38] <andrewanderson> sorry i don't understand what that means
[14:15:57] <bdoherty> are you sure the logic inside of your ".on(click)" function is actually executing when you click?
[14:16:20] <bdoherty> for example. put 'alert("fooooooo"); ' right about the image_id line
[14:16:37] <bdoherty> you should expect your browser to display a prompt that says fooooo after you click on the #risk element
[14:17:04] <andrewanderson> well, it was changing the images earlier
[14:17:24] <andrewanderson> and the alert works
[14:17:49] <bdoherty> okay
[14:17:57] <bdoherty> can you alert(image_id) after we set the variable?
[14:18:06] <bdoherty> to see if it has a value?
[14:18:32] <Paladine> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/PFZS6/21/  < kinda works - dunno how efficient it is or if it can be done an easier way....
[14:18:34] <duch_kazatel> why not just debug the code instead of alerting lkike that.
[14:18:39] <andrewanderson> empty alert
[14:19:04] <bdoherty> duch_kazatel, was assuming he wasn't too familar with debugger tools if he's new to JS
[14:19:11] <duch_kazatel> Paladine that's one way to do it.
[14:19:15] <andrewanderson> weird, i'll check my html bdoherty
[14:19:23] <andrewanderson> btw, http://white-harbor-rails-78206.use1.nitrousbox.com/#areas/1/hazards
[14:20:15] <Paladine> duch - probably a stupidly long way but I am not a programmer so it was the best I could do with my limited knowledge
[14:20:25] <andrewanderson> attr("value" works, but this.val() doesn't
[14:20:26] <andrewanderson> weird
[14:20:53] <andrewanderson> welp, everything is working to its specifications.. not sure why this.val didn't work
[14:21:07] <duch_kazatel> Paladine the smart way would have been to use a carousel plugin.
[14:21:27] <duch_kazatel> Paladine don't repeat work somebody else has all ready done.
[14:22:01] <Paladine> duch - but I wanted to try and do it myself
[14:22:16] <bdoherty> andrewanderson, looks like $().val() only works on certain elements?
[14:22:16] <bdoherty> The .val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements such as input, select and textarea. In the case of <select multiple="multiple"> elements, the .val() method returns an array containing each selected option; if no option is selected, it returns null.
[14:22:26] <duch_kazatel> Paladine you said that a few times all ready.
[14:22:28] <andrewanderson> doh
[14:22:29] <bdoherty> typically value attributes are found on select, input, textarea type elements
[14:22:42] <bdoherty> not div's, like you have in your code
[14:23:13] <bdoherty> when i've done accordion type things in the past, i would use another attribute name
[14:23:14] <bdoherty> like
[14:23:22] <bdoherty> data-image-id
[14:23:27] <andrewanderson> can i make those up?
[14:23:37] <bdoherty> as long as you have data-FOO
[14:23:50] <bdoherty> data- will allow you later grab the value from the element
[14:23:51] <bdoherty> like
[14:23:57] <bdoherty> $(myelement).data('foo')
[14:24:06] <bdoherty> <div data-foo="bar">
[14:24:17] <bdoherty> or in your case, maybe
[14:24:28] <bdoherty> <div data-image-id="risks">
[14:24:33] <warhol> trying to get a "remove" function to work on: http://jsfiddle.net/warhol/K3PGt/5/ . Some of this code was borrowed from another JSFiddle that used jQuery 1.4 and deprecated code like '.size' and '.live'... ANY direction is welcome, thanks
[14:24:38] <bdoherty> $(myelement).data('image-id')
[14:25:42] <vru_> warhol: $('#removeGuest').on('click'... => $(document).on('click', '#removeGuest', function(){...
[14:26:02] <duch_kazatel> even better - $('#guestDiv').on('click', '#removeGuest', function() {
[14:26:22] <warhol> ahh
[14:26:23] <warhol> ok
[14:26:31] <duch_kazatel> also: you can only use an ID once per page.
[14:26:39] <andrewanderson> works great
[14:26:47] <warhol> noted, thanks
[14:26:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/K3PGt/6/
[14:27:18] <warhol> Thank you andrewanderson!
[14:27:24] <warhol> i mean Duch
[14:27:29] <vru_> duch_kazatel: your right, smaller namespace, the better
[14:27:34] <duch_kazatel> than you EVERYBODY :D
[14:27:57] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, binding events as low as possible in the document is generally smart.
[14:30:47] <Zed7> Hey, is it possible to listen for $_GET value changes with jQuery?
[14:32:05] <bdoherty> $_GET is a PHP thing, jQuery isn't really related?
[14:32:14] <bdoherty> can you be more specific?
[14:32:34] <vru_> Zed7: do you mean the possibility to read GET variables?
[14:33:01] <jcubic> Zed7 if the $_GET changes the page refreshes, unless you use html5 pushState
[14:33:58] <andrewanderson> alright.. i have a weird question.. i'm using backbone+marionette on top of ruby, http://white-harbor-rails-78206.use1.nitrousbox.com/#areas/1/hazards <- is there a way to trigger a jquery every time i press an arrow? the issue is that once the images are colored in via pressing the buttons, when i press an arrow -> the whole area is redrawn
[14:35:04] <Zed7> I have a url that looks like this: http://www.website.com/mollify/?v=files/52f99038464bd I am trying to get the value of the 'v' $_GET variable each time it changes. The value changes when certain links are clicked but all of the page loads are done with ajax
[14:35:34] <bdoherty> Zed7, you can grab the query param without jQuery
[14:36:07] <vru_> Zed7: http://www.onlineaspect.com/2009/06/10/reading-get-variables-with-javascript/
[14:36:15] <|RicharD|> Hi I have a $(document).height() of 1735, after some actions the website load more content
[14:36:16] <vru_> Zed7: should be very helpful
[14:36:23] <|RicharD|> and became a $(document).height() of 2500
[14:36:29] <|RicharD|> (I show a hidden div)
[14:36:43] <jcubic> Zed7 location.search is QueryString
[14:36:54] <|RicharD|> but $(document).scrollTop() still show me max 1735 also when I'm to the bottom of the last div(that before was hidden)
[14:36:57] <Zed7> bdoherty: Thanks I will look into that
[14:37:09] <jcubic> here is $.query function https://gist.github.com/jcubic/3004101
[14:37:12] <|RicharD|> Why this ?
[14:37:13] <Zed7> vru_ thanks reading now
[14:37:32] <Zed7> jcubic: thanks didnt know that
[14:39:49] <bdoherty> Zed7, here's a snippet I wrote that I use at work all the time
[14:39:50] <bdoherty> http://pastebin.com/N0EgTYAW
[14:40:00] <bdoherty> it should break down the query params in the URL
[14:40:07] <bdoherty> than give you an object you can reference them with
[14:40:18] <bdoherty> so if you had ?foo=bar&zoom=wheee
[14:40:23] <bdoherty> you'd have an object you could reference them
[14:40:26] <bdoherty> querys.foo
[14:40:29] <bdoherty> querys.zoom
[14:40:40] <Zed7> bdoherty, awesome thanks for this, very helpful :)
[14:40:48] <duch_kazatel> I always liked this one: http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[14:42:05] <jcubic> duch_kazatel: nice
[14:42:20] <bdoherty> I'm trying to wrap my head around that one :o
[14:43:25] <andrewanderson> sorry for bringing myself up again.. is there a way run jquery in a dynamically generated site (using backbone), before each view is loaded?
[14:44:20] <bdoherty> you probably shouldn't "run" jQuery multiple times. Though if you include in the first <script> near the top of the page, it should be available to use by all the backbone views
[14:45:20] <andrewanderson> but what if i wanted to trigger jquery when each view is rendered?
[14:46:05] <bdoherty> So you don't really "trigger" jQuery. jQuery is a framework that persists for the life of the page. It's like tool chest. Once it's there, you just use the tools you need as you need them.
[14:46:26] <bdoherty> You don't "run" jQuery persay
[14:46:45] <|RicharD|> anyone here use waypoints ?
[14:47:02] <andrewanderson> man
[14:47:05] <andrewanderson> i hate jquery
[14:47:23] <andrewanderson> i take that back, it's pretty awesome
[15:12:49] <cheegle> Hi, I have a function that sets the value of a variable every 100ms. How would I detect when the value changes and store the value before it changed and the value it changed to?
[15:14:16] <jcubic> cheegle: why don't you put that code in that function while you set the value
[15:14:54] <duch_kazatel> everything cheegle said describes a nightmare scenario for me,.
[15:15:26] <cheegle> I am quite new to jQuery and I am not sure what syntax to use to do that
[15:15:45] <duch_kazatel> cheegle why are you checking something every 100ms?
[15:16:35] <duch_kazatel> that's a sign you're approaching something the wrong way.
[15:17:30] <Tomashe> hey guys i got a question , not really jquery one , but maybe connected . http://jsfiddle.net/jevgp/ < when ever the on click even is triggered i got "map" undefined which put some error there
[15:18:33] <cheegle> It is a value that changes when an ajax call is made but I dont how to detect the change event of the value so I thought I could check the value every 100ms and detect if it changed
[15:18:49] <duch_kazatel> cheegle are you doing the ajax call?
[15:19:16] <cheegle> no, its in a minified js file for a framework
[15:19:33] <duch_kazatel> are you triggering the ajax call in any way?
[15:19:35] <jcubic> Tomashe: you have syntax error missing ); at the end
[15:19:44] <duch_kazatel> there should be a success callback for that ajax.
[15:19:49] <Tomashe> yes sorry its just wrong . in my code its correct
[15:20:00] <Tomashe> but the error keep poping regarding the map var
[15:20:25] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe map only exists in that pageshow handler function.
[15:20:26] <jcubic> you store map as local variable in one function at get in another one you can't do that
[15:20:42] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:20:43] <cheegle> by clicking 2 different links, however these links a generated somewhere in that js file and it seems that I cant even apply a .click function to them
[15:20:51] <Tomashe> how can i store it as GLOBAL var?
[15:21:01] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe by declaring it is the shared scope.
[15:21:09] <Tomashe> ohhi see
[15:21:09] <cheegle> I have looked for a success callback but havent found one yet
[15:21:11] <Tomashe> damn me idiot me
[15:21:12] <Tomashe> lol
[15:21:13] <duch_kazatel> var map; then just reference it wherever.
[15:21:13] <Tomashe> let me try
[15:21:19] <duch_kazatel> cheegle what's the framework?
[15:21:55] <cheegle> mollify: https://code.google.com/p/mollify/
[15:22:31] <Tomashe> works like a charme , thanks guys
[15:22:55] <cheegle> It uses Bootstrap as its platform so I have looked through Bootstraps docs for a pageload / ajax call event but havent found one
[15:23:28] <duch_kazatel> so you're trying to extend mollify?
[15:24:20] <cheegle> yes, I am trying to add a back button for folder navigation for a client
[15:24:38] <duch_kazatel> either way, you can hook into $(document).ajaxSend(function(event, xhr, settings) {}); - that'll run every time an ajax event fires.
[15:25:10] <cheegle> cool thanks, I will give that a go
[15:27:58] <VectorX> how do i add a <tr id="data"><div></div></tr> after the last <tr> in a table and update it if it already exists
[15:28:15] <cheegle> duch_kazatel: thats perfect! thank you very much for your help :)
[15:29:38] <duch_kazatel> VectorX could do a simple if ($('#data').length > 0) {/*update logic here*/} else {/* insertion logic here */}
[15:30:47] <VectorX> duch_kazatel great, how about the adding code, basically i got var html ="some html";  i need to append a table row with a div that had the html in it
[15:31:45] <andrewanderson> http://white-harbor-rails-78206.use1.nitrousbox.com/#areas/1/hazards <- i have click triggers on #left-link and #right-link, but it's not binding.. the page is loaded dynamically in backbone
[15:32:32] <duch_kazatel> VectorX which part of your question are you confused about?  a quick google search for "jquery append" gives you this: https://api.jquery.com/append/
[15:33:00] <VectorX> adding the item after the last yr
[15:33:01] <VectorX> tr
[15:33:12] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson used the delegation syntax for .on() - $('parent').on('event', 'child', function(){});
[15:33:27] <duch_kazatel> where parent is something that exists on pageload, and child is your target element.
[15:33:49] <duch_kazatel> VectorX http://api.jquery.com/last/
[15:33:50] <andrewanderson> are you calling me out or
[15:33:53] <andrewanderson> what's ahppening
[15:34:05] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson *use the event delegation syntax
[15:34:12] <andrewanderson> i did
[15:34:19] <andrewanderson> 	$( "#main-region" ).on( "click", "#right-link", function( event ) {   		event.preventDefault();  		 alert("test"); 	});
[15:34:43] <duch_kazatel> and #main-region exists on pageload?
[15:34:47] <andrewanderson> yup
[15:34:59] <duch_kazatel> that sounds wrong to me.
[15:35:10] <duch_kazatel> double-check you selectors.
[15:35:21] <andrewanderson> i have other click events from #main-region
[15:35:28] <andrewanderson> that work as well
[15:36:41] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson then check your child selector and make sure it's an actual descended.
[15:37:47] <cheegle> duch_kazatel: is there an easy way of storing the previous value everytime the value changes
[15:38:29] <andrewanderson> the selector is correct
[15:39:00] <duch_kazatel> cheegle only if you manually store it first. try using an array and pushing/popping off of that.
[15:39:18] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson hrm.  and nothing else is stopping propogation of the click event?
[15:39:35] <cheegle> duch_kazatel cool thanks I will try that
[15:40:34] <andrewanderson> duch_kazatel: i don't know, i have backbone setup
[15:40:53] <andrewanderson> oh
[15:40:59] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:41:00] <andrewanderson> well, backbone is listening for those too
[15:41:08] <andrewanderson> so maybe it's just waiting till the listening is done?
[15:41:09] <andrewanderson> dunno
[15:41:14] <duch_kazatel> no clue.
[15:41:57] <andrewanderson> does jquery have any options as far as when it'd run?
[15:42:31] <duch_kazatel> it won't "defer" the event.
[15:42:34] <duch_kazatel> the event runs.
[15:42:44] <duch_kazatel> you can stop it from propogating, but not when.
[15:43:53] <pom_life> I'm trying to iterate over a 2D array and transform each element of each row into a Tile object. My solution works in other languages, but I don't understand why it's just transforming the first element in each row into an object. ---->http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/DrA8B/4/  (Line:33)
[15:44:27] <duch_kazatel> pom_life for in loops don't work the way you think they do in JS.
[15:45:15] <duch_kazatel> pom_life use a regular iterator instead.
[15:45:23] <pom_life> i, i>6, i++; ?
[15:45:43] <pom_life> similar to that, i mean
[15:46:50] <duch_kazatel> this won't work, but yeah - http://jsfiddle.net/DrA8B/5/
[15:47:06] <greengriminal> I have the following gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8946812 now I am trying to value of the api_url. I did try to filter this out by doing console.log $("div[data-ng-init~='initWidget']") but had no luck
[15:50:52] <cambazz> hello, is there a bootstrap channel? it seems that if i /j bootstrap, it will go to ##namespace
[15:51:48] <greengriminal> cambazz: try: #twitter-bootstrap
[15:52:35] <duch_kazatel> greengriminal your gist does not have nearly enough info to answer that question.
[15:53:03] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the help, I was able to do it. When would someone use a for..in in JS? Iterating over object properties?
[15:53:19] <duch_kazatel> enumerating object properties, yead.
[15:53:21] <duch_kazatel> *yeah
[15:54:17] <duch_kazatel> pom_life though array indexes are technically object properties.
[15:54:20] <duch_kazatel> go figure.
[15:54:32] <greengriminal> duch_kazatel: In laymans terms I have a <div> this gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8946935 and I simply want to extract the partial url
[15:54:34] <pom_life> yeah. I think it doesn't go in order, though, which is why it won't work
[15:54:52] <duch_kazatel> pom_life huh?
[15:55:11] <pom_life> does for...in go over each property in order?
[15:55:20] <greengriminal> duch_kazatel: Is there a way in which I can grab http://backup.somesite.com/angular thank you
[15:55:25] <duch_kazatel> pom_life what order?
[15:55:28] <pom_life> "for..in should not be used to iterate over an Array where index order is important. Array indexes are just enumerable properties with integer names and are otherwise identical to general Object properties. There is no guarantee that for...in will return the indexes in any particular order and it will return all enumerable properties, including tho
[15:55:28] <pom_life> se with non–integer names and those that are inherited."
[15:55:33] <pom_life> from a page I just read
[15:55:39] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[15:55:52] <duch_kazatel> greengriminal huh?
[15:55:59] <duch_kazatel> oh, greengriminal let me look.
[15:57:43] <duch_kazatel> greengriminal woah wait why do you have things embedded like that.
[15:58:20] <greengriminal> duch_kazatel: Its an angular thing
[15:58:47] <duch_kazatel> without parsing that, there's no "safe" way to get that data.  why not fetch that info using angular?
[15:59:16] <jcubic> greengriminal: JSON.parse($('#bb').data('ng-init').replace(/initWidget\(|\)$/g, '')).partial_url
[15:59:54] <jcubic> no wait, it's not valid json
[15:59:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's about as good as it's gonna get.
[16:00:03] <duch_kazatel> it'll be hacky either way.
[16:00:18] <jcubic> you will need to eval that thing
[16:00:24] <duch_kazatel> don't use eval please.
[16:00:25] <jcubic> or use regex
[16:00:50] <greengriminal> I was thinking could a regex not solve this?
[16:01:05] <kerin> there are many excellent JSON parsing libs
[16:01:08] <greengriminal> duch_kazatel: Will look over this.
[16:01:10] <kerin> this is a solved problem
[16:01:13] <jcubic> if company.company_id is var there is no way to go grab it without eval
[16:01:24] <duch_kazatel> this isn't JSON - it's a function call.
[16:01:36] <kerin> ah
[16:01:44] <kerin> good luck then :p
[16:01:51] <duch_kazatel> and it's ugly.  do something different, greengriminal
[16:01:56] <greengriminal> jcubic: don't want company.company_id. I just want: http://backup.somesite.com/angular
[16:02:07] <kerin> I'm trying to use a plugin (ddslick) and when I try to invoke it, console tells me "$(...).ddslick is not a function"... even though the plugin js is included and the invocation is wrapped in a domready closure
[16:02:11] <greengriminal> duch_kazatel: I will look at some of the JSON libs
[16:02:24] <duch_kazatel> greengriminal you cannot parse it because it's not JSON
[16:02:40] <duch_kazatel> greengriminal it's a function call, not JSON.  you need to pop your data elsehwere to turn to angular to solve your problem.
[16:03:06] <greengriminal> oh okay
[16:04:06] <jcubic> greengriminal: $('#bb').data('ng-init').match(/partial_url: *'([^']+)'/)[1]
[16:04:39] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:07:53] <greengriminal> jcubic: Exactly what I needed :)
[16:08:04] <greengriminal> and duch_kazatel: Thanks also.
[16:08:13] <kerin> I'm trying to use a plugin (ddslick) and when I try to invoke it, console tells me "$(...).ddslick is not a function"... even though the plugin js is included and the invocation is wrapped in a domready closure
[16:09:25] <greengriminal> jcubic: See now thats where I went wrong. I was trying to do $('#bb').attr('data-ng-init').match() but that never worked for me
[16:09:58] <greengriminal> In actual fact maybe it was just my regex
[16:14:29] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: What would be a more efficient way of executing this code on line 74? --->http://jsfiddle.net/DrA8B/6/                        I'm thinking of a way to create an array of integers, and then somehow check if the integer of the tile is in the array, then manipulating it.
[16:24:36] <NewFag64525> Yoh guys! where can i find a simple tutorial to make a simple pop up optin when homepage loads??????
[16:25:11] <snover> alert('hello')
[16:25:36] <snover> alert('do you want to opt in? yes or yes')
[16:25:51] <pom_life> $(document).ready(function(){alert('Welcome to my website!';});
[16:26:22] <jcubic> use confirm
[16:26:26] <andrewanderson> coffeescript with jquery question.. i have this in coffeescript: $("#" + index + "bw").show(); and it translates into this in jquery:  _results.push($("#" + index + "bw").show());
[16:26:47] <jcubic> confirm('Y or N')
[16:35:43] <BillCriswell> andrewanderson: I don't know where _results is coming from.
[16:37:44] <BillCriswell> pom_life: What's your goal here?
[16:38:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell they were trying to help NewFag64525
[16:38:51] <pom_life> BillCriswell: I've connected a CSS table to a javascript array. I'm wanting to do a mouseenter function that checks the type property of the TD that I mouse over. I know I can manipulate the array and get an effect on the CSS table, but is there a way to mouse over the CSS table and check the type on the array at the same spot? ---> http://jsfiddle
[16:38:51] <pom_life> .net/DrA8B/7/ bottom of the page
[16:39:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I was talking about the one before that.
[16:43:54] <pom_life> The goal is to have each tile on the table either a "hazard" or a "path". initially, every tile is a hazard. pressing the white button "illuminates" the path, and sets those tiles to path tiles. Ideally, mousing over a hazard tile will fade out the entire table, while mousing over a path tile is safe.
[16:45:20] <BillCriswell> so get from point a to b without setting off a hazard and if you hit a hazard it's like a game over?
[16:46:05] <pom_life> precisely. I need to do a $('FoobarTable td').mouseenter(function(){          <check if this tile in the array is a 'path' or a 'hazard', and end game if it's a 'hazard'>                   });
[16:47:14] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Do you want the <td>s to disappear or do you just want them to turn white?
[16:48:02] <pom_life> Which <td>s?
[16:48:25] <BillCriswell> All of them, you're fading out the <tds> which is making them go away.
[16:48:44] <pom_life> yeah that's placeholder code
[16:49:11] <pom_life> that code needs to be replaced with code that associates that specific td with the same element in the FoobarTable array, checks its type, and acts accordingly
[16:49:45] <pom_life> say I mouseenter into $FoobarTable[14][14], the last element in the last row.
[16:50:02] <pom_life> It's a hazard, so the code should execute a "gameOver()" function.
[16:50:13] <pom_life> I'm not sure how to "backwards associate" the two tables.
[16:51:53] <BillCriswell> pom_life: You can loop through that array and just add classes to the cells that are hazards.
[16:52:12] <pom_life> I've already done that.
[16:52:26] <pom_life> When I go through the array which starts as 15 rows of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0...] etc.
[16:52:48] <pom_life> I go through each element in each row and set it to a Tile() object, then set that object's "type" property to hazard.
[16:53:18] <pom_life> When I press the middle start square, the path for that level is calculated, and each "path" tile is set to 'path' instead of 'hazard' and turns white
[16:53:54] <pom_life> From there, I need to make it so mousing over a tile checks if that tile is 'hazard' or 'path'. if it's 'hazard', the table should fade out.
[16:54:09] <pom_life> My problem is finding a way to determine where the td I mouse over is on my array
[16:55:11] <BillCriswell> Are you adding a class to that tile?
[16:55:26] <duch_kazatel> I was about to suggest sending over a position for each TD.
[16:55:47] <pom_life> I'm changing a property in that tile when I load the level
[16:56:58] <pom_life> Go here --->http://jsfiddle.net/DrA8B/8/, and click the middle white square. Doing that "loads the level". It sets the path to follow to white, and sets each of those TDs to background-color: white
[16:57:29] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Right right.
[16:57:42] <pom_life> So from that position, you have to move your pointer.
[16:57:48] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[16:57:51] <pom_life> The pointer is initally at FoobarTable[7][7]
[16:58:02] <pom_life> When I move up one, it'd be at FoobarTable[6][7]
[16:58:44] <pom_life> But the page can't know that, because even though each tile in FoobarTable is associated with the $FoobarTable, it's not 'backward compatible'
[16:59:17] <pom_life> I can't mouse over a td and do > if ($this.type = 'hazard') {$FoobarTable.fadeOut('fast'); };
[16:59:31] <pom_life> because $this would refer to the td, not the correct spot in the array
[16:59:56] <BillCriswell> pom_life: As you're creating the <td>s why not add a class like "hazard" to the tile?
[17:00:02] <zim> Hi all. Look at the doc I don't think it can be done. In UI datepicker can I have d? for 1st 2nd like php j
[17:00:09] <pom_life> when you say class are you meaning property?
[17:00:17] <BillCriswell> Like an html class.
[17:00:29] <pom_life> oh, you mean a selector class
[17:00:43] <BillCriswell> if( $(this).hasClass('hazard') ) alert("BOOM")
[17:00:45] <pom_life> and then increment the class, and have a separate class for each tile?
[17:00:58] <pom_life> OH
[17:01:05] <pom_life> I see where you're going with that
[17:01:47] <pom_life> so when iterating over the board initially, set FoobarTable[i][j].element.class(Hazard);
[17:01:51] <zim> pom_life: for loop var class = foo+i
[17:10:17] <pom_life> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/DrA8B/9/ ----> This is exactly what I meant. Thanks a ton!
[17:11:01] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Awesome. Glad I could help!
[17:12:11] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Could be a pretty fun game if you make the path really right
[17:12:48] <pom_life> BillCriswell: It'll basically work by clicking the start button and illuminating the path. Moving off the start button darkens the board, so it will test your memory
[17:13:12] <BillCriswell> Good stuff.
[17:13:24] <pom_life> BillCriswell: What do you know about checking if an integer is in an array? On line 74 it gets really ugly because I have to apply 'path' to specific tileIDs. Right now I just have a bunch of or blocks. I'd ideally like to make an array with a list of the tileIDs to change, and check if each tile's tileID is in that array.
[17:14:25] <BillCriswell> pom_life: The array of arrays?
[17:15:15] <duch_kazatel> pom_life you can use array.indexOf(); if you don't care about IE8 or 7
[17:15:34] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Each tile is enumerated with a tileID. When setting up the level (clicking the start button), the function checks if the tileID for each tile is one of the 'path' tiles. If so, it changes properties. If not, properties remain the same.
[17:15:37] <BillCriswell> jQuery has $.inArray()
[17:16:26] <pom_life> I'm thinking of having tileset = [4, 5, 6, 8, 10], and then doing something like >  if (tileset.contains(tileID) {}; <
[17:16:45] <pom_life> Can JS natively check if an array contains an integer
[17:17:05] <duch_kazatel> in IE9 and above, there's array.indexOf();
[17:17:07] <BillCriswell> What duch_kazatel said would work just fine.
[17:17:09] <duch_kazatel> which will check for you.
[17:17:14] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[17:17:17] <pom_life> Oh, didn't see that message
[17:17:41] <BillCriswell> If tileset is an array of arrays you'd have to flatten the array first.
[17:17:44] <duch_kazatel> that link also has a polyfill for older browsers.
[17:18:00] <pom_life> Tileset would just be a normal array of integers
[17:18:07] <pom_life> Looks like indexOf would work just fine
[17:18:29] <duch_kazatel> fyi javascript has numbers - no "integers" or "doubles" or anything special like that.
[17:18:31] <duch_kazatel> bedcause it's js.
[17:18:47] <pom_life> Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
[17:19:46] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Might want to look into underscore.js
[17:20:14] <pom_life> What's that?
[17:20:42] <BillCriswell> A library with a lot of convenient things. If you're working with arrays a lot it could be really useful.
[17:21:59] <duch_kazatel> it's a really neat functional library.
[17:22:05] <duch_kazatel> lots of cool stuff.
[17:22:07] <pom_life> I see. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, Python & Ruby from Codecademy. I sometimes get overwhelmed at the amount of APIs there are to learn for every language. Is underscore as useful as jQuery?
[17:22:21] <duch_kazatel> it canbe.
[17:22:25] <duch_kazatel> *can be
[17:22:53] <pom_life> Are you a web dev by trade, duch?
[17:23:03] <duch_kazatel> yup
[17:23:22] <pom_life> What APIs do you find yourself using a lot in the various languages?
[17:23:23] <duch_kazatel> mostly frontend - html, css, javascript.
[17:23:37] <duch_kazatel> knowing the browser APIs for javascript are a godsend.
[17:23:52] <pom_life> there's Three.js, underscore.js, node.js.... so many I don't know where to start
[17:24:54] <duch_kazatel> you mean libraries/frameworks.
[17:25:52] <pom_life> yeah... I get my terminology mixed up
[17:26:06] <duch_kazatel> are you looking to make a career in frontend development?
[17:26:34] <pom_life> I know I'm wanting to do web development. I don't know for sure if I want to do front end or back end as a career yet, though
[17:27:30] <pom_life> I'm going to learn the hell out of both for personal projects
[17:27:43] <pom_life> But as far as what is more lucrative career-wise, I need to read up and ask around
[17:27:54] <duch_kazatel> do whichever you want
[17:28:36] <duch_kazatel> for frontend dev, learn the hell out of html, css, and javascript core + DOM API.  also learn jquery.
[17:28:44] <duch_kazatel> jquery is pretty widely used.
[17:28:44] <pom_life> is the demand similar?
[17:29:10] <pom_life> I live in Dallas, Texas, which I believe is the #1 in growth for computer-related fields (if not just high on the list)
[17:29:10] <duch_kazatel> similar between the two?
[17:29:12] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't know.
[17:29:43] <duch_kazatel> i know that there's a lot of demand for full stack.
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> and for specialists.
[17:30:04] <pom_life> Full stack is a developer familiar with all of it?
[17:30:39] <jphase> with one stack or another (LAMP stack, LNNP stack, etc.)
[17:30:49] <pom_life> & did you get your BSc in CompSci? Or did you go the 'experience' route?
[17:31:08] <duch_kazatel> i went experience route.
[17:31:21] <jphase> I got my BS but I honestly shouldn't have in retrospect
[17:31:30] <pom_life> I hear a lot of people say that
[17:31:36] <jphase> unnecessary loans is the only thing that comes of that these days imo
[17:31:56] <jphase> seeing as how you learn 90% of your stuff on google anyhow... reading is the best teacher :)
[17:31:57] <duch_kazatel> really depends on what you're doing.  i still don't understand search algorithms.
[17:31:59] <pom_life> Yeah, but I hear a lot of horror stories of people with the necessary skills that won't even be considered because of lack of paper
[17:32:08] <pom_life> and that's getting worse and worse
[17:32:12] <duch_kazatel> pom_life 5 years or a degree.
[17:32:16] <duch_kazatel> that's the current "standard"
[17:32:23] <duch_kazatel> for entry level at least.
[17:32:34] <pom_life> Right. Without a degree, where does experience come from? Personal portfoilio? Getting 'lucky
[17:32:35] <pom_life> ?
[17:33:11] <jphase> you can do contract jobs or get entry level coding jobs without much experience if you have a portfolio yeah
[17:33:19] <jphase> internship
[17:33:36] <pom_life> I was under the impression that internships are usually given to students
[17:33:37] <duch_kazatel> i started as a data entry tech and slowly moved into the career.
[17:34:02] <jphase> internships is a glorified word for "professional bitch" really, at least these days it is
[17:34:09] <jphase> data entry, grunt work
[17:34:19] <jphase> tech support, etc.
[17:34:27] <duch_kazatel> depends on the company.
[17:34:29] <pom_life> My plan was to go to school with the financial aid I already have, work very hard throughout community college and make dean'sa list, then when moving to a university to finish out, try for academic scholarships all the while working on an extensive portfolio
[17:34:37] <duch_kazatel> my old place is hiring dev interns but actually paying them decently.
[17:34:44] <jphase> my company does that too yeah
[17:34:58] <duch_kazatel> pom_life just be aware that most places won't give a flying fuck about the dean's list :)
[17:35:08] <duch_kazatel> they will care about demonstrable skills.
[17:35:15] <pom_life> scholarships are easier to get when on dean's list
[17:35:17] <duch_kazatel> that portfolio will be important.
[17:35:19] <pom_life> was the point of that
[17:35:26] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[17:35:48] <pom_life> Don't a lot of web devs work for a corporation, and do things on the side hoping one might take off?
[17:35:50] <duch_kazatel> i'd focus on backend dev, though eventually you learn enough that you can work on almost any side with enough effort.
[17:35:53] <pom_life> I'd like to play that lottery
[17:35:59] <duch_kazatel> pom_life you can do that
[17:36:05] <duch_kazatel> I don't.  others do.
[17:36:35] <jphase> I don't like the corporate environment either
[17:37:08] <pom_life> I just want a secure career doing what I love, and what I love is programming :]
[17:37:09] <duch_kazatel> really depends on where you're at.  i work for a fairly large business but the environment kicks ass.
[17:40:58] <duch_kazatel> pom_life are you familiar with version control?
[17:41:44] <duch_kazatel> that's another skill that's very helpful
[17:41:57] <pom_life> You mean Project build 0.0.1  etc. ?
[17:42:08] <pom_life> making changes enumerates it?
[17:42:15] <pom_life> 0.1.0... or 0.0.2
[17:42:27] <duch_kazatel> like git vs mercurial
[17:43:00] <pom_life> no, not familiar
[17:43:11] <BillCriswell> SVN is another one.
[17:43:13] <duch_kazatel> learn about source control.
[17:43:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah SVN.
[17:43:44] <BillCriswell> It took me a while to get git, still not 100% on it.
[17:43:49] <duch_kazatel> I prefer git
[17:43:57] <BillCriswell> Really need a GUI in front of it or I'm basically useless.
[17:43:57] <pom_life> Okay, I'll look into it. Do you ever utilize canvas?
[17:44:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:44:16] <duch_kazatel> haven't needed to.
[17:44:20] <pom_life> I was reading into canvas and it seems pretty difficult :/
[17:44:28] <pom_life> Nothing I can't handle eventually though
[17:44:32] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[17:44:48] <pom_life> I can't imagine learning programming pre-Google.
[17:44:55] <pom_life> Did people spend all day on technical manuals?
[17:44:56] <duch_kazatel> books.
[17:45:09] <duch_kazatel> there are some great resources out there
[17:45:11] <pom_life> How did they look up a very specific error?
[17:45:44] <duch_kazatel> depends.  at a certain point you learn what the errors just mean.
[17:45:51] <duch_kazatel> but when you're learning, books.
[17:46:33] <pom_life> The problem with finding good books is the updating of technology. I have a javascript book in my closet from oreilly, but its an old ass version.
[17:46:53] <duch_kazatel> JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is pretty good.
[17:47:05] <duch_kazatel> once you learn the core language, MDN is your best friend.
[17:47:23] <pom_life> Okay, I'll add that to my "to buy" list.
[17:47:54] <duch_kazatel> or just keep hacking away.
[17:47:58] <pom_life> Would you mind helping me to grasp this indexOf deal in the context of my code? I'm having a little trouble
[17:48:06] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:48:42] <pom_life> http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/dGkEQ/1/ , line 74. You can see all of the or statements I use.
[17:49:20] <duch_kazatel> woah.  yup.
[17:49:34] <pom_life> I'm thinking of setting > var levelPaths = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 22, 37, 52, 67, 82, 97];
[17:49:58] <pom_life> then when looping, check if FoobarTable[i][j].tileID <is in> levelPaths
[17:50:04] <pom_life> if it is, make changes.
[17:50:28] <duch_kazatel> if (levelPaths.indexOf(FoobarTable[i][j].tileID) > -1)
[17:51:16] <pom_life> in english, if the index location of FoobarTable[i][j]'s tileID is great than -1, execute code
[17:51:28] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[17:52:21] <pom_life> When declaring a global variable, is there another way besides var variable = null; ? like maybe var variable; ?
[17:52:30] <duch_kazatel> that's not declaring it globally.
[17:52:38] <duch_kazatel> variables are block-level
[17:54:50] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5Rxm5/
[17:56:28] <pom_life> When that particular script terminates and another script is activated later on, is accessing the foo variable again called 'closure'?
[17:56:41] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:56:57] <duch_kazatel> levelOne() in that example is a closure - it "closes over" another function.
[17:57:00] <adamsilver> why "$(':checkbox:not(.checkall)').closest('table').click(function ()" is not excluding checkboxes with class checkall?
[17:57:36] <pom_life> I thought closure was just accessing a variable that doesn't exist anymore...
[17:57:43] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:57:48] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures
[18:02:19] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: In my 'game', you can cheat by right clicking. Is there a way to set up an eventHandler that listens for right-click and executes a function if it detects it?
[18:05:07] <duch_kazatel> pom_life sure - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/737022/how-do-i-disable-right-click-on-my-web-page
[18:05:36] <duch_kazatel> pom_life but be aware that disabling right-click is not a normal thing to do
[18:06:36] <ShakeSpear> hello. :(
[18:06:53] <ShakeSpear> I have a very important question, can anyone help me?
[18:07:04] <pom_life> Ask, don't ask to ask
[18:07:11] <pom_life> Well, disabling it is a little extreme. I was thinking a function that just makes you auto-lose the game. I'll look into event handlers
[18:07:56] <ShakeSpear> I wanted to make a button that would load a random html page.
[18:08:21] <ShakeSpear> I was recommended by a friend that it was possible through php, but he also mentioned that jQueryMobile has its own way to do that.
[18:08:36] <duch_kazatel> pom_life check out .on() - that's the preferred way to do event binding with jquery
[18:09:02] <ShakeSpear> I'm sorry, I am code illterate, i cannot understand what you just said. :(
[18:09:04] <pom_life> ShakeSpear: A random page from your site?
[18:09:06] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear define "load a random html page"
[18:10:23] <ShakeSpear> The web-app has over 200 pages.
[18:10:30] <ShakeSpear> I wanted a button that could load a random page.
[18:10:57] <ShakeSpear> If that means i have to get a link of each and every single page into that one piece of code, i wont mind doing that since the entire app is hard coded. :0
[18:11:41] <pom_life> How are the web pages named?
[18:11:47] <pom_life> is it like a wiki?
[18:11:48] <ShakeSpear> named?
[18:11:59] <pom_life> like /1.html ? or /content.html?
[18:12:02] <ShakeSpear> um. they are just html pages.
[18:12:20] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear just random filenames?
[18:12:27] <ShakeSpear> Random html files.
[18:12:40] <BillCriswell> Is there a pattern to the name.
[18:12:42] <duch_kazatel> and you just want to open a random one?
[18:12:48] <ShakeSpear> so for example, http://www.test.com/file1.html
[18:12:50] <pom_life> is it like yoursite.com/1.html, yoursite.com/2.html?            or yoursite.com/contentA.html
[18:12:54] <ShakeSpear> yes.
[18:12:56] <pom_life> okay, that makes it a lot easier
[18:12:57] <ShakeSpear> exactly like that.
[18:13:00] <ShakeSpear> sorry. :o
[18:13:14] <pom_life> have the button generate a random number from 1-200
[18:13:23] <pom_life> then append that number to the file name
[18:13:24] <duch_kazatel> you don't need jquery or php to do that.
[18:13:24] <pom_life> and load it
[18:13:37] <ShakeSpear> what is append? :o
[18:13:47] <pom_life> concatenate I meant
[18:14:10] <ShakeSpear> is there a tiny example you can link me to? I am so sorry for the trouble.
[18:14:15] <pom_life> sure, hold on.
[18:14:23] <BillCriswell> location.href = 'file' + Math.floor( Math.random() * 200 ) + '.html';
[18:14:24] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear do you know anything about javascript?
[18:14:27] <ShakeSpear> thank you. i appreciate your patience!
[18:14:31] <ShakeSpear> Kind of not really.
[18:14:42] <duch_kazatel> what is this for?  sounds pretty trivial - why is it so important?
[18:14:46] <ShakeSpear> Quite literally, illiterate.
[18:14:51] <ShakeSpear> But I am trying slowly to learn.
[18:15:15] <BillCriswell> ShakeSpear: You should learn to read before writing a story.
[18:15:23] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[18:15:26] <ShakeSpear> I can read, just not write.
[18:15:32] <duch_kazatel> then you can't read.
[18:15:40] <ShakeSpear> :/
[18:15:45] <duch_kazatel> why is this so important?
[18:15:53] <duch_kazatel> seems pretty trivial - what makes for the time crunch?
[18:15:57] <ShakeSpear> Because it brings life to the project.
[18:16:06] <duch_kazatel> "the project" being...?
[18:16:10] <duch_kazatel> are you getting paid to develop it?
[18:16:14] <ShakeSpear> nope.
[18:16:21] <ShakeSpear> I am 'developing' it myself.
[18:16:37] <ShakeSpear> If there was another word i would use it but most of it is just copy paste off of jQueryMobile demos.
[18:16:38] <duch_kazatel> so then learn how to do it :)
[18:16:51] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible way to accomplish things.
[18:17:00] <ShakeSpear> I am not accomplishing anything.
[18:17:17] <ShakeSpear> Trying to build my self-esteem to make myself believe that i can actually do something.
[18:17:37] <duch_kazatel> you can.  right now you're not :)
[18:17:51] <pom_life> ShakeSpear: http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/9kQLt/1/
[18:17:59] <pom_life> ShakeSpear: Go to Codecademy right now and start learning.
[18:18:02] <ShakeSpear> Lets just say that JavaScript didn't make any sense to me before but now it actually makes a little sense.
[18:18:11] <pom_life> ShakeSpear: In one month you will be good enough to start off on a good foot
[18:18:16] <BillCriswell> ShakeSpear: That's the normal progression.
[18:18:26] <BillCriswell> We were all there.
[18:18:28] <ShakeSpear> Codeacademy
[18:18:30] <grafi> unless you're me
[18:18:31] <duch_kazatel> take on problems of varying difficulty and learn more.
[18:18:32] <grafi> in which case
[18:18:38] <grafi> you already know everything
[18:19:04] <pom_life> ShakeSpear: In one month I learned enough of HTML/CSS, Python, Javascript & jQuery to have an okay foundation.
[18:19:16] <pom_life> From there, learning more is a matter of learning about a concept and applying it to a small example
[18:19:16] <ShakeSpear> O.O
[18:19:30] <pom_life> Codecademy is free, fun, and intuitive.
[18:19:42] <ShakeSpear> In one month you learned 3 things!!!!
[18:19:47] <ShakeSpear> that is amazing!
[18:19:48] <BillCriswell> pom_life: That must have been a very dedicated month.
[18:19:51] <grafi> nice try codeacademy salesperson
[18:19:52] <grafi> :<
[18:20:03] <pom_life> Hey, I'm just saying. It puts everything you need to know in one location.
[18:20:05] <ShakeSpear> Yeah
[18:20:16] <grafi> pom_life what was your starting point though? absolute zero?
[18:20:16] <ShakeSpear> Well I gave it a go and several other things at code.org
[18:20:16] <duch_kazatel> they learned far more than you have ;)_
[18:20:44] <ShakeSpear> I have to admit, I am scared of trying because i think its hard.
[18:20:49] <duch_kazatel> it's not hard.
[18:20:52] <ShakeSpear> is that true that its hard to learn how to code?
[18:20:54] <pom_life> grafi: I had a visual basic class in high school, and I spent 2 months learning php a year ago
[18:20:57] <pom_life> It'[s not hard, no.
[18:20:58] <pom_life> Are you male?
[18:21:04] <duch_kazatel> it's hard like any other skill.
[18:21:04] <ShakeSpear> yes
[18:21:08] <grafi> odd question
[18:21:09] <grafi> ^^
[18:21:18] <ShakeSpear> yes very odd question actuallly.
[18:21:22] <duch_kazatel> learning to ride a bike can be "hard"
[18:21:25] <pom_life> You already think logically then
[18:21:30] <grafi> lolz
[18:21:30] <pom_life> Code is just logic
[18:21:43] <grafi> thats why women cant code
[18:21:46] <pom_life> Women can code
[18:21:47] <ShakeSpear> LOL.
[18:21:50] <pom_life> But their brains are different
[18:21:50] <grafi> it makes their heads explode
[18:21:52] <grafi> <.<
[18:21:57] <duch_kazatel> javascript is actually pretty simple because it's got such an instant feedback mechanism
[18:22:11] <grafi> tight screw-up loop
[18:22:11] <ShakeSpear> Well I have a situation that stops me from actually trying.
[18:22:13] <grafi> xD
[18:22:25] <pom_life> IDK. I think javascript's tendency to not let you know exactly where you f'ed up can be hard at first.
[18:22:25] <grafi> do or dont there is no try
[18:22:26] <BillCriswell> ShakeSpear: What's that?
[18:22:29] <ShakeSpear> I am a high school dropout. A SCA construction site supervisor @ the age of 19.
[18:22:31] <grafi> womp womp
[18:22:44] <pom_life> Python shows you exactly which line you f'e up on
[18:22:51] <ShakeSpear> I have this dying passion of learning how to code but all this stuff stops me.
[18:22:52] <ShakeSpear> :/
[18:22:59] <pom_life> Why would that stop you?
[18:23:04] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear I didn't go to college and make bank as a programmer.
[18:23:14] <duch_kazatel> i did terribly in math, too.
[18:23:21] <grafi> well
[18:23:24] <pom_life> Have you gone to codecademy yet? Go click on the first javascript lesson and see how easy it is.
[18:23:34] <ShakeSpear> Because I work 15+ hours a day, for a month worked 22 hours and yes actually ran on two hours of sleep.
[18:23:46] <ShakeSpear> I did @pom :)
[18:23:54] <pom_life> Then just put in 15 minutes a day on Codecademy. Do 2 lessons a day. You'll get there.
[18:24:00] <grafi> you literally could have finished the first few lessons while explaining why you cant
[18:24:01] <grafi> :D
[18:24:07] <pom_life> It's better to do a little every day then have a cram session once a week
[18:24:14] <pom_life> than*
[18:24:22] <ShakeSpear> awesome!!! thank you for your inspiration guys!!!
[18:24:25] <ShakeSpear> i really appreciate it.
[18:24:31] <pom_life> No problem. If I can do it, you can do it.
[18:24:51] <ShakeSpear> i am at coeacademy and i will join you guys when i am a pro at JavaScript and Python! Expect me back!
[18:24:57] <ShakeSpear> thank yo.
[18:24:59] <ShakeSpear> you*
[18:25:40] <BillCriswell> Don't aim for "pro".
[18:25:53] <BillCriswell> "aim" for "I can get something to work kind of"
[18:25:57] <grafi> aim for ninja
[18:26:01] <ShakeSpear> @pom i have one question regarding your code.
[18:26:02] <grafi> get a .ninja tld
[18:26:04] <grafi> :<
[18:26:07] <pom_life> Aim for 'competent'. Codecademy is just a starting point. It gives you the skills you need to learn more.
[18:26:09] <BillCriswell> grafi: Ugh.
[18:26:11] <pom_life> Yes?
[18:26:14] <grafi> BillCriswell :D
[18:26:16] <ShakeSpear> it says: var link = 'www.yoursite.com/file'+random+'.html';
[18:26:21] <pom_life> mhm
[18:26:27] <ShakeSpear> The files are in different folders.
[18:26:28] <grafi> BillCriswell do you like .guru better?
[18:26:43] <BillCriswell> grafi: I think I'm too old for those titles haha.
[18:26:52] <grafi> you and me both
[18:26:52] <pom_life> Do some folders have 20 pages, while others have more? Some have less?
[18:26:53] <grafi> ..
[18:27:04] <ShakeSpear> yes.
[18:27:10] <grafi> i spent the last few days checking the new domains out ... the stuff that they try to sell
[18:27:15] <grafi> its fucking awful
[18:27:18] <pom_life> that complicates things a bit
[18:27:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha indeed.
[18:27:24] <ShakeSpear> Oh no.
[18:27:25] <grafi> there is apparently a .gay oô
[18:27:28] <grafi> .sexy
[18:27:34] <grafi> aaaand
[18:27:44] <grafi> a billion other shity domain endings
[18:27:48] <grafi> including .domains
[18:27:49] <grafi> ._.
[18:27:54] <grafi> :|
[18:27:55] <ShakeSpear> I was wondering if there was a way to create a .js for each folder which would load up random html files from that folder.
[18:27:55] <duch_kazatel> yup
[18:27:58] <ShakeSpear> if that is possible of course.
[18:28:05] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear it's possible and a terrible idea.
[18:28:07] <BillCriswell> http://crswll.com/ is what I have.... and it's a default tumblr blog lol
[18:28:15] <ShakeSpear> possible and terrible idea?
[18:28:22] <ShakeSpear> can you explain why it is a terrible idea?
[18:28:23] <grafi> i love it :P
[18:28:31] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Is that a portrait of you on your site?
[18:28:34] <duch_kazatel> because it's splitting your logic up in a terrible way.
[18:28:40] <BillCriswell> pom_life: You bet.
[18:28:41] <grafi> but you could have billcriswll.cool BillCriswell :D
[18:28:52] <ShakeSpear> How so? :o
[18:28:54] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear what you want it do create an array of all the possible paths.  that's where PHP comes into play.
[18:29:12] <BillCriswell> https://twitter.com/crswll is actually me.
[18:29:13] <grafi> lol starting blog, 2012
[18:29:14] <grafi> xD
[18:29:27] <duch_kazatel> then use your javascript to select and random item from that array
[18:29:33] <BillCriswell> grafi: I've been building websites for like 12 years, still never actually wrote a blog post.
[18:29:48] <grafi> i have installed more blogs than i care to admit
[18:29:51] <grafi> :D
[18:30:01] <grafi> i quite like changing the theme every month or so
[18:30:02] <grafi> xD
[18:30:07] <BillCriswell> grafi: I hear that.
[18:30:10] <ShakeSpear> Hmm.
[18:30:19] <BillCriswell> Ever play with Anchor? Nice and easy.
[18:30:28] <ShakeSpear> I think i can use that code to actually make something usefull but i dont know if it will work.
[18:30:28] <grafi> BillCriswell im your biggest fan on twitter now
[18:30:29] <grafi> :<
[18:30:35] <grafi> hm anchor yes
[18:30:48] <grafi> not sure if that made it out in the internet though
[18:30:53] <grafi> probably not
[18:31:09] <BillCriswell> grafi: You're the new follower
[18:31:10] <BillCriswell> ?
[18:31:13] <grafi> yup
[18:31:13] <grafi> :P
[18:31:21] <ShakeSpear> bascially, looking back, i am gonna back a .js file which will be linked to via a randominzation code. Each folder will have its own. When that JS file loads up, its gonna load up a html page that will be random off of that specific folder.
[18:31:23] <BillCriswell> You look like a bad ass.
[18:31:26] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear is there a consistent amount of files in each folder?
[18:31:36] <BillCriswell> Totally not what I was thinking.
[18:31:37] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear that... errr... that's not going to work.
[18:31:38] <ShakeSpear> there is less than 10 or 15 files.
[18:31:45] <ShakeSpear> Oh no :/
[18:32:02] <ShakeSpear> Oh wait.
[18:32:03] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear that's why you need the PHP or similar server-side bart.
[18:32:04] <duch_kazatel> *part
[18:32:15] <ShakeSpear> How will that be good?
[18:32:25] <grafi> that is about the only picture of me that looks tolerable :P
[18:32:29] <ShakeSpear> the word server-side already scares my soul.
[18:32:39] <duch_kazatel> because then you could add or remove files without needing to modify any JS files.
[18:33:01] <ShakeSpear> well, like i mentioned before, if i need to manually do stuff, i will do it manually. :)
[18:33:11] <grafi> always automate
[18:33:13] <grafi> everything
[18:33:14] <grafi> :P
[18:33:15] <duch_kazatel> ShakeSpear that's a terrible way to code.
[18:33:19] <ShakeSpear> :o
[18:33:39] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I go home.
[18:33:40] <ShakeSpear> i think i should show you guys what i am doing exactly. :(
[18:33:41] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[18:33:45] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha.
[18:34:00] <ShakeSpear> i only have one page since my entire project was lost due to a mistake. :( but i can link you to it.
[18:34:08] <grafi> dont laugh at me!
[18:34:09] <grafi> :D
[18:34:09] <ShakeSpear> if you wouldn't mind.
[18:34:42] <grafi> so link
[18:34:52] <ShakeSpear> ishakespear.tk/test
[18:35:00] <ShakeSpear> nothing works as x10 took my previous free website down.
[18:35:04] <BillCriswell> grafi: k sorry!
[18:35:08] <ShakeSpear> its okay.
[18:35:12] <grafi> BillCriswell you meany :P
[18:35:17] <ShakeSpear> it was my fault anyways. :(
[18:35:41] <ShakeSpear> no links work but that is one of the html pages.
[18:35:46] <grafi> so what does it do
[18:35:51] <grafi> or should it do
[18:36:10] <ShakeSpear> when you click the list items, it creates a popup which has a embedded youtube link.
[18:36:16] <ShakeSpear> *that was not the cause of takedown*
[18:36:23] <grafi> :P
[18:36:32] <ShakeSpear> Afterwards the users can simply play those videos and enjoy.
[18:37:14] <ShakeSpear> I uploaded an episode of that show on to my 'free' server to test if it would be better to host the videos but evidently that did not work out and after talking to my friends, i am never gonna do that.
[18:38:00] <grafi> yeah hosting videos is hard
[18:38:06] <ShakeSpear> they say that video hosting requires a lot of ram on your server which = more money and that is what i dislike. besides i can get possible DMCA complaints so yep that aint happening
[18:38:45] <ShakeSpear> but yeah that is what it does and i am trying to refine jQueryMobile pages and try to make something better.
[18:38:55] <ShakeSpear> THESE PEOPLE QUITTING CHAT IS SOOO ANNOYING. :(
[18:39:35] <grafi> thats when you get a decent chat client and mute that noise ^^
[18:40:03] <ShakeSpear> well its not the noise, its the announcement of someones arrival or when they leave.
[18:40:41] <ShakeSpear> well regardless. thank you for all your help guys.
[18:40:44] <BillCriswell> He means the visual noise.
[18:40:52] <ShakeSpear> ^ yes
[18:40:59] <grafi> noise is noise
[18:41:02] <grafi> :D
[18:41:09] <BillCriswell> Noise is a pretty cool word.

[19:11:56] <BillCriswell> clu3: .next()
[19:12:30] <clu3> BillCriswell, that's what i thought, $div.next(".myDiv") but it doesn't work
[19:24:53] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Did you say something to me earlier? I was eating dinner. When I came back I saw the notification but I got disconnected.
[19:29:49] <clu3>  BillCriswell, that's what i thought, $div.next(".myDiv") but it doesn't work
[19:43:17] <pom_life> BillCriswell: You there
[19:45:22] <shoky>  <BillCriswell> pom_life: You bet.   <BillCriswell> pom_life: I want to make a game now.
[19:46:39] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Aha, got you in the mood, did I?
[19:46:58] <shoky> he's not here ;p
[19:47:30] <pom_life> OH, I figured you were some form of transdimensional bot where he was talking in another channel and it showed up here
[19:47:55] <shoky> well, that too perhaps
[19:48:19] <pom_life> You pretty good with jQuery?
[19:48:38] <shoky> suppose so
[19:49:51] <pom_life> I have a little issue I'd like some help with. Here I have a little "game" I'm working on. Clicking the middle white square begins the game. A path is shown to the goal, and you must memorize it before leaving the space and following along. http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/dGkEQ/2/
[19:50:02] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[19:50:12] <pom_life> Reaching the 'goal' and clicking it should fade the table out.
[19:50:14] <Starcraftmazter> is there an event to listen for dom changes on a specific element
[19:52:11] <pom_life> On line 159 you can see the code to fade the table out when .goal is clicked
[19:52:41] <pom_life> FoobarTable[0][0] is a '.goal', as evidenced by starting the game, leaving the window and clicking debug, and looking in console.
[19:55:58] <shoky> pom_life: you're only adding the goal class when initializing the grid, when clicking the middle square
[19:56:10] <shoky> so your $('.goal')  isn't finding anything
[19:56:39] <pom_life> What's a workaround you'd recommend?
[19:57:39] <shoky> easiest would be event delegation, e.g.  $FoobarTable.on('click', '.goal', function() { ... })
[19:57:56] <shoky> instead of $('.goal').click(function() { ... })
[19:58:37] <shoky> alternatively, you can add the click handler specifically to the goal square, after you've determined which one is the goal when building the grid
[19:58:52] <shoky> but delegation is fine so i'd just do that ;p
[19:59:07] <pom_life> Yeah, the delegation is great. Is that really how easy event handlers are in jquery?
[19:59:09] <pom_life> If so, good lord
[19:59:31] <shoky> heh
[19:59:52] <pom_life> Is there an event handler with parameter 'rightclick' or the equivalent of?
[20:00:48] <shoky> nope, you gotta check the event argument that's passed to the click handler   function(e) { if (e.which === 2) { ... } }    or something like that
[20:01:00] <shoky> not sure about the 2 ;p
[20:01:08] <pom_life> i see. i'll look it up for further information.
[20:01:10] <pom_life> cheers for the help!
[20:01:17] <shoky> np
[20:01:49] <pom_life> shoky: What's your favorite JS framework/library besides jQ?
[20:02:10] <shoky> knockout.js
[20:02:52] <shoky> it's a bit like angular, but less of a full framework, less opinionated
[20:03:12] <pom_life> I'm not even familiar with angular.
[20:03:18] <pom_life> What would you use knockout for primarily?
[20:04:50] <shoky> for data-binding, it wires up the event handling for you, you just need to declare how your view elements should behave,
[20:05:37] <shoky> for example if you wanted to have a text input to write your name in, and you wanted the text you put in there to appear in some other <div> as text or something,
[20:05:39] <shoky> while you're typing
[20:06:19] <shoky> with jquery alone you'd need to add an event handler to the input, and in there write it back out to the <div>
[20:06:22] <tw2113> it was a good day today shoky
[20:06:40] <shoky> or if you have 5 elements you want to keep "in sync" like that, it's trivial with knockout/angular
[20:07:06] <pom_life> shoky: that sounds incredibly useful. is it easy to pick up?
[20:07:16] <shoky> but i'm not really explaining good, i really recommend you try the knockout.js interactive tutorial, it's great, and will also give you a flavor for what angular.js gives you
[20:07:37] <shoky> and i mention angular because its the most popular MVC-like framework
[20:07:51] <shoky> knockout is less so :(
[20:08:20] <shoky> tw2113 it can only go downhill from now
[20:08:41] <tw2113> i know, i may end it early with sleep to prevent that
[20:08:48] <tw2113> but i got to work with js today :D
[20:08:51] <pom_life> shoky: what do you think of underscore.js?
[20:09:37] <shoky> pom_life i like it, have used it on some projects. but usually if i have jquery included i'll just use jquery's stuff
[20:09:50] <shoky> though underscore has some neat extras
[20:10:21] <pom_life> shoky: Would you say jQuery is the most popular javascript library?
[20:10:50] <shoky> yeah i think so
[20:11:04] <shoky> by far, even
[20:11:17] <farmdawgnation> I'd second that statement.
[20:11:56] <pom_life> What are your experiences with canvas?
[20:13:23] <shoky> tw2113, greasemonkey'ing your porn sites doesn't count
[20:13:36] <shoky> i don't have much experience with canvas
[20:14:20] <farmdawgnation> The canvas element in HTML or something else? If the former, my experience is limited to tweaking JS graphing libraries that have used them. So very little.
[20:14:30] <tw2113> i can't say i'm on those sites long enough for greasemonkey use. I did create a script to do some stuff with plentyoffish though
[20:14:35] <tw2113> mostly hiding users I don't want to see
[20:15:05] <farmdawgnation> tw2113: o.O That isn't a feature of the site?
[20:15:09] <shoky> sounds like some sick porn
[20:15:16] <tw2113> nope, they don't offer blocking/hiding
[20:15:18] <farmdawgnation> Lol
[20:15:26] <tw2113> so i rolled my own pseudo version
[20:16:10] <GoSox> I have an error in my script before my .preventDefault() call, so my form is being submitted the old fashioned way. Because the current page is reloading, i'm loosing console so i can see where the error actually is
[20:16:17] <GoSox> how can i debug this?
[20:16:20] <pom_life> I have a question. You know how some people make js games with canvas? What's stopping someone from simply copying the source code from the site?
[20:16:29] <pom_life> Is there a way to obfuscate js?
[20:16:43] <shoky> yep
[20:20:56] <shoky> GoSox: with a debugger?
[20:21:03] <shoky> ?ftjq @ GoSox
[20:21:03] <b-ot> GoSox: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[20:21:21] <GoSox> the problem is Safari's dev tools suck ass
[20:21:32] <GoSox> i switched to chrome and now i'm doing much better
[20:21:57] <shoky> no problem, then
[20:21:59] <farmdawgnation> pom_life: Most people don't care enough to copy it. hehe.
[20:23:14] <pom_life> If it were to take off, hypothetically, that might be relevant
[20:24:49] <shoky> it doesn't matter to most people
[20:25:07] <shoky> if it does, don't publish it on the web, or obfuscate
[20:33:02] <GoSox> So I'm doing the following, and I'm not getting animation. The content just instantly pops into view
[20:33:04] <GoSox> $("#id").html($content).slideDown('slow');
[20:33:12] <GoSox> the catch, $content is an html table
[20:33:46] <GoSox> but i'm not sliding down the table, i'm sliding down the div, that is the parent of the table. shouldn't this work?
[20:34:39] <shoky> is it hidden to begin with?
[20:35:36] <GoSox> hmmm i thought so, but maybe thats my problem
[20:36:58] <GoSox> shoky: yeah that was the problem 8-)
[20:40:20] <jayar> can anyone help with an ajax/json question? its working with .ajaxForm() so i was hoping maybe someone here could help. #ajax noones answering...
[20:48:48] <pom_life> shoky: still there?
[20:50:28] <duch_kazatel> the best part about programming: drinking while you do it.
[20:51:07] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: #jquery while at work, #jquery while home?
[20:51:17] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[20:53:11] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Good. I have an event handler >  $FoobarTable.on('click', '.goal', function() <      that looks for a click on a td with class .goal and executes a function. is there a "hover" version of 'click' in .on()?
[20:54:00] <duch_kazatel> pom_life .on() can take any DOM event as its first arg.  you could do hover, mouseenter, mouseleave, etc.
[20:54:59] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: $FoobarTable.on('hover', '.goal', function() {...}   doesn't work, where 'click' does, though. Unless I'm typing hover wrong
[20:55:14] <duch_kazatel> try mouseenter
[20:56:23] <pom_life> Works. Does hover not work on TDs or something/
[20:56:37] <duch_kazatel> i spaced - there is no over.  there's a mouseover.
[20:56:46] <pom_life> ah.
[20:57:08] <duch_kazatel> there's also a .hover(), which really acts as a shortcut to mouseenter and mouseleave.
[20:57:12] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[20:57:24] <pom_life> Going back to using 'click'. Is there a way to determine type of click? (i. e. right click)
[20:57:40] <snover> there is more than one mouse button?
[20:57:54] <pom_life> dese mac users doe
[20:58:23] <prtksxna> pom_life: You could use e.which
[20:58:25] <duch_kazatel> pom_life yeah -  $FoobarTable.on('click', '.goal', function(event){ event.which });
[20:58:49] <prtksxna> pom_life: 1 is normal click, 2 is middle click and 3 is right click, I think
[20:59:24] <prtksxna> s/normal/left
[20:59:33] <duch_kazatel> yup
[21:01:13] <pom_life> You mean if (event.which === 3) {...}; ?
[21:01:17] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[21:01:28] <duch_kazatel> if you want to compare.
[21:01:36] <duch_kazatel> and with that knowledge bomb, i'm off again.
[21:01:45] <pom_life> Is JS like C# where absolutely everything is an object of some sort?
[21:09:47] <pom_life> prtksxna: http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/3E3jj/
[21:10:04] <prtksxna> pom_life: mostly, yes
[21:10:07] <pom_life> prtksxna: It should theoretically read 'right' on rightclick, but it doesn't.
[21:10:40] <prtksxna> pom_life: You need to pass event as an argument to the function http://jsfiddle.net/3E3jj/1/
[21:11:22] <pom_life> prtksxna: Still doesn't seem to read the right click
[21:12:09] <snover> ok, i am going to put you out of your misery now
[21:12:15] <snover> also, consider using google sometime
[21:12:18] <snover> event.which is for keys
[21:12:36] <snover> event.button is for mouse buttons. 0 left, 1 middle, 2 right.
[21:14:00] <pom_life> I use google a lot, but when people are around and don't mind fielding questions, the minutes saved can add up. Plus, a lot of times I'll be alerted to a newer or better way to do something. If someone doesn't feel like fielding constant questions, they are free to not answer.
[21:14:48] <prtksxna> pom_life: Ah, thats because you need the mousedown event http://jsfiddle.net/3E3jj/3/
[21:14:53] <snover> event.buttons is the preferred standard, which was future and is now not future. 1 left, 2 right, 4 middle, 8 fourth, 16 fifth
[21:16:14] <Zesty> can someone help me with this? its driving me insane.... WHAT data type does this return? http://pastie.org/8724788
[21:16:30] <Zesty> its making me so mad, in chrome it looks like an array
[21:16:40] <Zesty> but its not a jquery object from what i can tell
[21:16:57] <prtksxna> snover: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/ says, "Use event.which instead of event.button." can you please point me to the correct documentation
[21:17:02] <Zesty> actually i guess its an instance of jQuery
[21:17:10] <Zesty> but.. it says call .get(0) to get the aactual array
[21:17:16] <Zesty> and for me that just returns a string (the first item)
[21:17:19] <Zesty> as if it were an array
[21:17:20] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent.buttons
[21:17:44] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.which
[21:18:09] <prtksxna> snover: Oh, the button thing doesn't seem to have very good support
[21:18:22] <prtksxna> snover: Rather, undocumented
[21:18:34] <prtksxna> s/undocumented/undocumented support
[21:20:49] <pom_life> prtksxna: Thanks a lot! Did the trick. I've learned a lot today.
[21:21:11] <prtksxna> pom_life: You're welcome
[22:06:49] <NewFag64525> i have this image filter gallery , is there a way i can auto select a category using jQuery or Javascript? because right now its showing all filters..
[22:22:55] <WhoD> lol :) wonder what the flood was was for simbalion :D so many times
[22:32:45] <Vivekananda> hey everyone a question
[22:32:46] <Vivekananda> for the autocomplete widget when an option is clicked the widget places the "value" in the box. I also want to place some string in a different box on click . how to dot this ? Can this be done ?  I dont see a .click override in the API of jquery . not sure if I should override though or if there is a simpler way?
[22:34:03] <Jattenalle> add a .change on the input box?
[22:39:24] <Velveeta> unless autocomplete triggers a change event on the input, a programmatic setting of an input's value doesn't trigger change automatically
[22:39:42] <Jattenalle> it should trigger the change event
[22:40:22] <Jattenalle> all the other ui widgets trigger their appropriate native event as well.. so.. but i could be wrong.. worth a try though, simple enough
[22:43:02] <Velveeta> i just scraped my way through its source to check that, it looks like it does include coverage to trigger a change event when needed
[22:44:21] <Velveeta> vivekananda: also, if you'd decided to use a click listener vs change, there's no need to override the old click handler, you can add multiple click handlers and they'll all be executed
[22:44:44] <Velveeta> ok, i'm out, it's late here, adios :)
[23:37:05] <lite_> so im trying to implement some keyboard navigation for a dialog of mine. the only problem is that the dialog does not have an input field and as such does not trigger .on('keydown') events
[23:41:17] <Cork> lite_: set tabindex="0"
[23:41:32] <Cork> and .focus() when you show the dialog
[23:42:12] <TheJHNZ> i'm trying to run a function inside another function outside of a function inside a function
[23:42:24] <TheJHNZ> how would i do this ?
[23:42:25] <Cork> what?
[23:42:41] <Cork> TheJHNZ: code please
[23:42:59] <TheJHNZ> uhmm ill give example
[23:43:38] <TheJHNZ> (function() { function load() { does stuff } })(); $(document).ready(function () { load(); });
[23:43:45] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[23:43:58] <lite_> Cork: tabindex on what? the element containing the dialog or a hidden input field ?
[23:44:23] <Cork> lite_: the element needs to be visible
[23:44:42] <Cork> lite_: you can set tabindex="0" on any element to be able to focus it
[23:44:47] <lite_> ok
[23:46:04] <TheJHNZ> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Pwh32/1/
[23:46:30] <Cork> TheJHNZ: you can't
[23:46:35] <TheJHNZ> ;__;
[23:46:37] <Cork> load is in a different namespace
[23:46:42] <TheJHNZ> i see
[23:46:48] <Cork> you could move load to the global scope
[23:46:54] <Cork> window.load = load
[23:57:33] <lite_> Cork: cant get it to work :/. I set tabindex="0" on the dialog and $(element).focus() when showing the dialog(element being the dialog)
[23:57:39] <lite_> still not catching keydown events
