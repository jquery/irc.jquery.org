[00:00:19] <ruby_on_tails> devslash: what does that mean ?
[00:00:24] <devslash> ok
[00:00:52] <devslash> so i developed a site that uses jplayer and I'm trying to override the controls like play button, stop etc
[00:01:02] <devslash> so  i can modify its appearance and layout
[00:01:28] <ruby_on_tails> you can use jquery to do that
[00:01:32] <devslash> how
[00:01:35] <ruby_on_tails> you could use another css file too
[00:01:51] <ruby_on_tails> create another stylesheet and override styles
[00:01:54] <devslash> i did
[00:01:59] <devslash> can i give you the link
[00:02:03] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[00:02:11] <devslash> http://mms-test.no-ip.org/MyMusicStreamer/
[00:02:34] <devslash> when you do view source go to the line  div.jp-audio div.jp-type-single a.jp-play {
[00:02:52] <trewd6> $('#filesUploaded').append('<span id="' + $newName.replace('.', '') + '"><img src="' + $newName + '" border="0" alt="" style="width:100px;height:100px"/> <br/> <a href="#">Remove</a></span>');
[00:02:58] <trewd6> any idea why my image doesn't show?
[00:03:03] <trewd6> the path is correct
[00:03:24] <ruby_on_tails> devslash: put your overrides in a css file and load if AFTER the default css of the player
[00:03:46] <devslash> well for the purpose of this program i can't do that
[00:03:54] <devslash> the code is generated on the fly from php
[00:04:08] <devslash> heres the thing
[00:04:15] <ecthiender> hello, using the animate method can I animate box-shadow of an element?
[00:04:16] <devslash> it is overriding the background image
[00:04:26] <devslash> so it seems to be running at the right time
[00:04:33] <devslash> i don't think its a timing issue
[00:04:33] <ruby_on_tails> then try using !important for every style you mention
[00:04:57] <devslash> how do you do that
[00:05:24] <ruby_on_tails> border: 1px solid back !important;
[00:05:34] <ruby_on_tails> add important after some css and see whether it works or not
[00:05:36] <devslash> i see
[00:05:38] <devslash> ok
[00:05:39] <ruby_on_tails> if it works, apply to all
[00:06:05] <trewd6> ruby_on_tails: can you helpm e
[00:06:20] <devslash> ruby_on_tails: you're a genius
[00:06:36] <ruby_on_tails> trewd6: ?
[00:06:39] <devslash> that did the trick
[00:06:51] <trewd6> any idea why my image doesnt load?
[00:06:55] <trewd6> $('#filesUploaded').append('<span id="' + $newName.replace('.', '') + '"><img src="' + $newName + '" border="0" alt="" style="width:100px;height:100px"/> <br/> <a href="#">Remove</a></span>');
[00:07:31] <trewd6> the image tag gets created, however no image is displayed
[00:07:49] <ruby_on_tails> trewd6: if you are on chrome, check the NET tab, it will show the url the browser is fetching for the image, check whether that url is fine or not and whther opening that image in a new tab works or not
[00:09:29] <trewd6> ruby_on_tails: the image is there and loads if I open it separately
[00:09:50] <trewd6> <IMG style="WIDTH: 100px; HEIGHT: 100px" border=0 alt="" src="C:\PostImages\processing\beautiful_1-500x334_64beaa47160a47539673644172449c89.png" />
[00:10:06] <ruby_on_tails> trewd6: check permissions issues for that image
[00:10:39] <devslash> ruby_on_tails: thanks for your help
[00:10:45] <ruby_on_tails> devslash: np
[00:10:57] <trewd6> ruby_on_tails: permissions are fine
[00:11:48] <trewd6> i am saving to the same folder using the same process
[00:11:52] <ruby_on_tails> trewd6: remove height/width/border to make sure they are not affecting the image, try to load the image in full size first, also check response for the image request in the NET tab, does it show image data being loaded or some error ?
[00:12:10] <trewd6> ruby_on_tails: i'm using firefox
[00:12:15] <ruby_on_tails> use chrome
[00:12:26] <ruby_on_tails> firefox also has the NET tab in firebug
[00:33:34] <Whirl3d> trewd6, I think you have to create the image element
[00:34:40] <Whirl3d> I've had problems with appending img tags to content and the images won't show. So the workaround that I have always used is to just create the image without a src attribute, assign a load handler, apply the src attribute and it works.

[00:47:58] <subdesign> hi, any help on removing duplicated images on a html page with jquery?
[00:51:40] <Pitel_laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/hc8Zw/1/ what is wrong with this? I would expect output with divs with lists containing just one list item each time.
[00:54:31] <boulet101010> and the problem is that c contains b?
[00:54:57] <Pitel_laptop> boulet101010: yup
[00:55:56] <Pitel_laptop> that's what clone should do, right?
[00:56:37] <Pitel_laptop> boulet101010: and also the list containing "aaa" is completeley missing.
[00:56:40] <boulet101010> i'm working on it
[00:57:27] <boulet101010> i think that clone is good
[00:57:37] <HardFu> I have a page that crashes IE8 because it includes jquery cookie
[00:57:49] <HardFu> how can I fix that, besides not using jquery cookie :D
[01:00:23] <boulet101010> Pitel_laptop: it's a wrong use of the appendTo params i think
[01:01:18] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/hc8Zw/4/
[01:01:21] <boulet101010> this is good
[01:02:54] <Pitel_laptop> oh, i see, appendTo can't handle context parameter.
[01:05:18] <wichobabas> hi everybody!
[01:05:36] <wichobabas> i'm getting some trouble with jquery
[01:05:47] <wichobabas> i don't know if this is the correct place
[01:05:57] <wichobabas> for asking help :(
[01:06:28] <mast3rpyr0> if it wasnt 4am it might be heh
[01:06:36] <mast3rpyr0> depends how complex, whats your issue?
[01:06:49] <Pitel_laptop> boulet101010: thanks
[01:07:26] <wichobabas> thanks :)
[01:07:41] <wichobabas> im trying to autocomplete some text
[01:07:47] <wichobabas> with jquery + json
[01:08:42] <wichobabas> i'm following the example at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[01:08:56] <mast3rpyr0> whats your issue?
[01:09:17] <wichobabas> i think that it's not loading the external json array
[01:09:40] <wichobabas> i call it with source: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/autocomplete_networks/index.json"
[01:09:50] <mast3rpyr0> comment out the jquery function and submit the form and see what data your getting
[01:10:10] <mast3rpyr0> you cant link to 127.0.0.1
[01:10:29] <wichobabas> 13     <script>  14     $(function() {  15         $( "#tags" ).autocomplete({  16             source: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/autocomplete_networks/index.json",  17             minLength: 3  18         });  19     });  20     </script>
[01:10:43] <seutje> sweet
[01:11:36] <wichobabas> let me re copy paste that
[01:11:42] <wichobabas>  13     <script>
[01:11:47] <wichobabas>  14     $(function() {
[01:11:54] <mast3rpyr0> post it on pastebin
[01:12:02] <mast3rpyr0> or fiddle
[01:12:08] <wichobabas> ok, :)
[01:12:56] <mast3rpyr0> but the javascript looks fine, see what your getting from your backend script without the javascript
[01:13:24] <majd> hey #jquery - does repeatedly binding and unbinding events to different elements on a page have a heavy performance penalty? I have something like 100+ text inputs, and i want to allow only numeric input into those inputs
[01:13:28] <wichobabas> this is the link
[01:13:28] <wichobabas> http://pastebin.com/EG3cCEZG
[01:13:55] <mast3rpyr0> make them type number
[01:13:59] <mast3rpyr0> instead of text
[01:14:11] <majd> putting a mask on all text inputs at the same time seems unreasonable, so i'm thinking that i should do the bind on .focus() and unbind on .blur()
[01:14:28] <mast3rpyr0> <input type="number">
[01:14:56] <majd> mast3rpyr0: my app is already pretty big and it's definitely not html5
[01:15:09] <mast3rpyr0> make it html5? :P
[01:15:14] <majd> it'll be too difficult to convert at this point
[01:15:27] <mast3rpyr0> Find and replace? lol
[01:15:36] <mast3rpyr0> the whole thing doesnt have to be html5 heh
[01:15:49] <blackspotwiggins> ?g event delegation @ majd
[01:15:50] <bot-t> majd, Event Delegation versus Event Handling - how to create quicker ... - http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/
[01:15:52] <mast3rpyr0> but if you have to use jquery, your focus idea sounds fine
[01:16:19] <blackspotwiggins> why bother asking if you dont like the answers that dont happen to confirm what you are already doing
[01:16:55] <majd> i'm looking for better ideas! i still think the focus() blur() idea is clumsy
[01:17:13] <majd> i'll take a look at event delegation
[01:19:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/8zVTR/12/
[01:19:36] <stenno|work> good day, i want to use a tree-view element in my website. on the first search i found jsTree. is that the one you would also recommend?
[01:24:20] <Whirl3d> majd, just handle the keypress event in one location if the key pressed is not a number and the event.target is an input field of the numberOnly class, preventdefault
[01:24:47] <mast3rpyr0> Hey is anyone able to help out with a jquery slide animation looking glitchy?
[01:24:50] <Whirl3d> of course you'll have to make special exceptions for arrows tab, etc.
[01:25:02] <Whirl3d> mast3rpyr0, do you have a fiddle?
[01:25:17] <mast3rpyr0> i dont, though my code didnt work at all in fiddle
[01:25:22] <mast3rpyr0> i can give you a direct link
[01:25:26] <Whirl3d> ok
[01:25:30] <mast3rpyr0> il pm you
[01:30:11] <faraway> i know that there is a fallback solution using the hash if pushState for History does not exists. does anyone know if there is a solution that search engines will correctly follow such links (the one with the hash) if they are posted on blogs, boards or other sites?
[01:30:46] <faraway> i know there is a solution for google .. but i heard there are others ^^
[01:35:30] <HardFu> anyone with IE8 here? :)
[01:36:52] <blackspotwiggins> faraway, fallback to regular links
[01:37:17] <blackspotwiggins> i mean, the anchors in html should be regular links anyway
[01:38:03] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: i fall back to regular urls currently, i just thought if there is a good solution with anchors
[01:38:28] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: and no anchors are not regular links, cause the anchor part is never seen by the server
[01:39:08] <blackspotwiggins> im sorry wat?
[01:39:23] <blackspotwiggins> your links are not <a href="/something"> ?
[01:41:10] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: on the browsers that support  pushState use ajax for loading the page content that changes if the user clicks on a link and then update the url with pushState
[01:41:18] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: thats works greate
[01:42:03] <blackspotwiggins> and on browsers that dont support it, it loads the page regularly
[01:42:04] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: for older browsers there is the approach around to use something like this domain.tld/#link/to/page.html to change to url without page reloading
[01:42:17] <blackspotwiggins> and for google crawlers the links look as i previously posted, no?
[01:42:19] <blackspotwiggins> so what's the problem?
[01:43:00] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: this one is at least a bad solution if someone copyies such a link from the addressbar  tot post e.g. on a board or blog
[01:43:26] <blackspotwiggins> then dont fucking use it
[01:43:28] <blackspotwiggins> ..
[01:44:13] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: that's why i ask if there is a solution to get around this (for google there is one) but there are another search engine around
[01:44:44] <blackspotwiggins> you answered it yourself
[01:44:57] <blackspotwiggins> IF you use hash links THEN they appear on addressbar, which you dont want
[01:45:06] <blackspotwiggins> IF you dont THEN this problem does not occur
[01:45:10] <blackspotwiggins> thats the end of it
[01:45:55] <majd> Whirl3d: just did exactly that. Thanks for the advice!
[01:49:30] <Trudko> Guys  i need selector for fields type hidden :hidden returns also fields which are hidden I need only input type="hidden"
[01:53:00] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: ;) that's what i'm currently doing and what i will do as long as there is no solution that will solve this. and to the "thats the end of it" … well if no one searches for a solution to a problem, no one will find. i'm sure that i won't solve this , but i also thought this about others things, where i indeed found a solution.
[01:54:35] <Trudko> this did not work either http://jsfiddle.net/Cqwtf/
[01:54:53] <faraway> Trudko: $("input[type='hidden']")
[01:55:17] <Trudko> faraway: ?
[01:55:40] <faraway> Trudko: your example logs 2 so what is not correct there ?
[01:55:59] <Trudko> it should one because I only one the #t one (hidden)
[01:56:00] <blackspotwiggins> faraway, there is no other solution
[01:56:12] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont want to mess with the address shown to user
[01:56:16] <blackspotwiggins> deal with it
[01:57:15] <slartsa> what's the best way to .load content into div from multiple sources with a click?
[01:57:41] <Trudko> faraway: it should one because I only one the #t one (hidden)
[01:57:51] <lz> slartsa .click ( $.ajax
[01:58:50] <martisj> anybody know how i can flash a dialog box to the user and close it after a set time?
[01:58:52] <faraway> Trudko: exalt that fax that you have two elements with the id 't'   you have two elements that are type=hidden within the div with the id 's' where you search for elements with type=hidden
[01:59:05] <faraway> Trudko: except the fact
[01:59:08] <Trudko> lol ok
[01:59:17] <slartsa> lz: http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/8/ this is what I'm using to load one content, but would it require alot of modification to add the possibility of several source-files?
[01:59:26] <Trudko> faraway: sorry i had dumb moment
[01:59:46] <faraway> Trudko: ;)  just was not sure if you relly understand your problem :D
[02:01:09] <lz> slartsa, you can chain those .get() calls
[02:01:16] <mazzachre> I have no idea how to search for this :( Is there a way to make "cut off" strings in elements (overflow hidden) look "better"... something like StringUtils.abbreviate in Java (apache commons)?
[02:02:04] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at this --> http://jsfiddle.net/mR8A4/ <-- why does that have a flade overlay during its fade on IE7 and 8 ?

[02:04:30] <mazzachre> blackspotwiggins: thx
[02:05:44] <Kingsy> such a weird issue.. does fading in jquery have any known bugs for IE7 and 8 ?
[02:06:58] <boulet101010> how to print a character by its ascii code in JS?
[02:07:16] <stenno|work> >> "a".charCodeAt(0);
[02:07:20] <stenno|work> fail
[02:07:28] <stenno|work> well, its charCodeAt
[02:07:31] <boulet101010> ty
[02:07:43] <stenno|work> this is #jquery, right, not ##javascript
[02:07:49] <stenno|work> why don't you have a js bot :<
[02:08:06] <Kingsy> stenno|work: any idea about my issue?
[02:08:28] <stenno|work> dunno about IE and honestly i don't care :>
[02:08:40] <Kingsy> lol yeah I know what you mean
[02:08:56] <boulet101010> stenno|work: i just asked it in jquery and javascript ^^
[02:27:20] <faraway> Kingsy: does this work for you http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/mR8A4/2/
[02:34:37] <beasty> *yawn*
[02:37:45] <Kingsy> faraway: hmm I think I fixed it.. it looks like it was that alhpa transparency problem..
[02:38:05] <Kingsy> the png needed a blackground color, so I am going to have to redo the images.. or scrap the fade effect on IE7 and 8
[02:38:23] <Gargoyle> Morning all.
[02:39:31] <Pitel_laptop> I have a string in iso-8859-2. how can I convert it to utf8? I can't change the encoding of the source string.
[02:39:58] <blackspotwiggins> in js?
[02:40:46] <Gargoyle> Got a really annoying bug with IE 8 refusing to handle image uploads with the jquery form plugin. Well, actually, the images are successfully uploaded, but it's giving me one of those blocked content warning when the server sends the json response back. Been googling for a while and tried setting type: 'json', and contentType: 'application/json' options, but still no joy. Any ideas?
[02:42:10] <Pitel_laptop> blackspotwiggins: yes
[02:42:39] <astropirate> Anyone hiring freelance JS/Node.js/C++ developer? :) PM me
[02:42:59] <|RicharD|> helllo
[02:43:16] <|RicharD|> it's possible do: $('input').data('poll_id').val()
[02:43:17] <|RicharD|> ?
[02:43:41] <Gargoyle> |RicharD|: Try it! :P
[02:43:46] <seutje> Pitel_laptop: isn encoding document-wide?
[02:43:51] <ravenzz> data will return its value
[02:44:04] <|RicharD|> no
[02:44:09] <|RicharD|> a me in firebug not worls :D
[02:44:15] <|RicharD|> works*
[02:45:53] <|RicharD|> this $('input').data('poll_id') return me 4 that is the poll_id
[02:46:13] <|RicharD|> but i want take also the value content of this input where there is a determinate poll_id
[02:46:45] <blackspotwiggins> Pitel_laptop, maybe this https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/
[02:47:08] <blackspotwiggins> but you'd need to hack it to work in a browser
[02:49:05] <icjs> hi, i'm using jqueryui datepicker but for some reason the calender does not appear. i'm using the same code on another html test page  and it does appear. i've tried the obvious things in the console (jquery is loaded, selector is fine)
[02:52:30] <nFFF> Guys any reason why animations arent smooth in my browser
[02:52:40] <nFFF> is it anything todo with shit code ? :|
[02:52:46] <nFFF> I can figure out why theyre so choppy
[02:52:56] <nFFF> simple slideUp and slideDown
[02:54:59] <juha_> astropirate: did anyone pm you?
[02:56:58] <faraway> nFFF: do oyu have paddings on this elements ?
[03:01:53] <nFFF> faraway some
[03:02:31] <faraway> nFFF: if you have also text in there it could look bad at the end of the animation, some "jumps" do you mean this ?
[03:02:49] <nFFF> Yes
[03:03:51] <faraway> nFFF: you can prevent this when you remove the paddings form the element you animate and wrap the content of the element you want to animate with an div where you add the paddings you need
[03:04:06] <faraway> nFFF: this would probably solve you problem
[03:07:21] <icjs> hi, i'm using jqueryui datepicker but for some reason the calender does not appear. i'm using the same code on another html test page  and it does appear. i've tried the obvious things in the console (jquery is loaded, selector is fine)
[03:10:24] <stenno|work> icjs, well ... how does you test code differ from your other code?
[03:11:25] <icjs> stenno|work, the code is the same, just the html differs. the test html which embeds the working calender is much more simple. the html page where the calender doesn't appear has other hand-coded javascript in it.
[03:12:17] <icjs> i have the calender widget "linked" to an input textbox, if i focus the textbox and press return then todays date gets int there, but no caledner appears
[03:12:20] <stenno|work> so ... care to actually _show_ the relevant code? there is not much more we can do
[03:12:25] <stenno|work> if you don't show the code
[03:12:29] <stenno|work> !paste
[03:12:32] <stenno|work> `paste
[03:12:35] <stenno|work> gargh

[03:15:55] <stenno|work> search for anything related to CSS or HTML and the first entries are w3schools crap
[03:16:16] <fly-> eh?
[03:16:39] <icjs> stenno|work, the widget is "Activation Date (alt):"
[03:17:12] <NodeX> stenno|work : and how is that wrong?
[03:17:20] <icjs> stenno|work, are w3c not respected? i was going to follow their tutorial to build up my js/css knowledge
[03:17:36] <stenno|work> w3c is not w3schools and they are not affiliated
[03:17:50] <stenno|work> W3Schools is not related to the W3C and has many problems: http://w3fools.com/
[03:19:05] <stenno|work> NodeX, you said 'poor ranking sites are not good'. with w3schools we have an example where a crap page is ranked _better_ than a good page (for example MDN)
[03:19:07] <icjs> ok, hmm thats not a good endorsement. well i have a bunch of other resources from quirksmode.org and mozilla dev network, i should prolly focus on those
[03:19:17] <stenno|work> yes, i recommend MDN
[03:19:21] <icjs> ok
[03:19:21] <NodeX> err
[03:19:37] <NodeX> by  not good I mean not good for people
[03:23:30] <M1k1> hi
[03:23:33] <M1k1> when come jquery 1.8?
[03:25:01] <ribot> hey
[03:25:16] <dabear> M1k1: when ready is
[03:25:33] <M1k1> dabear: u have site?
[03:26:38] <dabear> Site have I do
[03:26:53] <ribot> i'm using a script that makes firefox act strange: href='javascript:toggle_display("add_existing_relative"); $("#search_relative_text").focus();'
[03:27:25] <dabear> ribot: don't ever add js code in the href
[03:27:37] <dabear> use click handlers
[03:27:44] <dabear> ?click @ ribot
[03:27:50] <bot-t> ribot, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[03:28:25] <ribot> dabear: such as onclick?
[03:29:00] <dabear> see link above
[03:30:49] <ribot> too complex to say yes or no?
[03:31:49] <Whirl3d> Could someone please tell me why defining this prototype def is failing? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Fm9EW/2/
[03:32:36] <Whirl3d> nvm
[03:32:44] <Whirl3d> maybe if I would learn to spell..
[03:32:49] <faraway> Whirl3d: ;)
[03:34:10] <nFFF> faraway, thanks that definately helped
[03:35:11] <faraway> nFFF: np
[03:38:20] <icjs> stenno|work, any idea wrt jsfiddler stuff?
[03:38:28] <nFFF> faraway, its still not 100% smooth
[03:38:30] <nFFF> :<
[03:39:05] <faraway> nFFF: can you show a jsfiddle example where you can reproduce this ?
[03:39:06] <blackspotwiggins> nFFF, js animations will never be 100% smooth
[03:39:20] <nFFF> faraway
[03:39:26] <nFFF> the thing is on jsfiddle its smooth :|
[03:39:27] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/UZM6e/
[03:39:32] <nFFF> click on fabric by
[03:39:52] <Whirl3d> ugggg! I am making this entirely too difficult. Could someone please give me some basic advice on setting up a simple website from scratch?
[03:40:12] <stenno|work> icjs, sorry i don't have the time to read through 200+ LOC :) but the jslint implies that you have syntax errors
[03:40:27] <icjs> stenno|work, hehe np :-)
[03:40:40] <mast3rpyr0> i can help ya whirl
[03:40:46] <icjs> stenno|work, jyi - this is the test code where it DOES work http://jsfiddle.net/t9HJS/
[03:40:54] <icjs> i will look at the lint feature of jsfiddle
[03:41:01] <faraway> nFFF: then you cannot do much … the more content is effected by the animation the slower it will be, who much will depend on browser and pc
[03:41:16] <nFFF> Fair play I thought that might be the case
[03:41:25] <nFFF> I mean theres no way to improve my code I dont think
[03:41:25] <Whirl3d> lemme post what I have and i'll be right back.
[03:41:39] <nFFF> I don't transerve the DOM on click, its all pre stored in vars
[03:41:47] <nFFF> So not sure if I can make it faster
[03:42:11] <nFFF> Wait I could pre store $('.clickable') and filter that
[03:44:03] <MacroMan> nFFF: It's not all in vars. I notice that you have $(this). in quite a few places where you could just have that.
[03:45:59] <blackspotwiggins> nFFF, use css3 transitions if you need maximum UI performance
[03:46:07] <blackspotwiggins> they are gpu accelerated and all that good stuff
[03:46:21] <blackspotwiggins> the anim is going to look shitslow on any IE anyway
[03:48:24] <nFFF> MacroMan, yea the performance increase from that will be minimal
[03:48:30] <nFFF> $(this) doesnt access the dom
[03:48:41] <nFFF> it just wraps the current dom element in a jquery object
[04:11:37] <Whirl3d> lol. I disabled the cache in Chrome Dev Tools and now my page hangs with the status text: waiting for cache.
[04:11:39] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:36:10] <mbrochh> hi all i'm trying to use the combobox example from the ui docs: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[04:36:42] <mbrochh> i put all this into a file combobox.js, import jquery, jquery-ui and the ui-lightness css theme and my combobox.js
[04:37:01] <mbrochh> added a select with options and call $("#combobox").combobox()
[04:37:08] <mbrochh> it seems to work but I don't see a button
[04:39:31] <luke--> hi
[04:40:01] <luke--> is there a way in jQuery UI's draggable, to position an element absolute while it is dragged, and while it is dragged only?
[04:43:37] <Myrth> hi, is there a consensus aboutbest jquery validation lib?
[05:04:08] <djsounds02> can anybody tell me the proper name for this slider rotator thing? http://cl.ly/image/2R2M1k1u3c29
[05:04:54] <faraway> djsounds02: content rotator
[05:06:44] <djsounds02> thankyou, this one doesnt seem to work without an old version of jQuery
[05:07:10] <Log1x> djsounds02: check out BXSlider -- its probably the easiest configurable one of my finding unless you write your own
[05:07:24] <Log1x> but im using it on one of my sites and it was super easy to style/integrate compared to the other liek 5+ i tried.
[05:07:38] <djsounds02> I saw that one yeah, looked good
[05:30:19] <granden> Hi
[05:31:19] <granden> I would like an array of 4 elements with 4 random numbers in each. And they should be unique. This is what I have come up with, http://pastebin.com/5n0RgbqK
[05:31:32] <granden> But some times it enters the same number in two different elements of the array.
[05:32:22] <johnkpaul> granden: php question?
[05:35:22] <Elephphant> Hey, im having an issue with getJSON call in . each() ($.each($.getJson()). The return function seems to loose the context of the var i stored $(this) in. Any idea why or a way around this ?
[05:36:21] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: when you say "the return function"
[05:36:25] <johnkpaul> do you mean the get json callback?
[05:36:28] <Elephphant> yeh #
[05:36:38] <Elephphant> sorry, the callback :)
[05:37:24] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: there are a few different options, but the most straightforward is something like var self=this; on the top of your .each function
[05:37:30] <johnkpaul> and then use $(self) inside the callback
[05:37:38] <johnkpaul> ?this @ Elephphant
[05:37:39] <bot-t> Elephphant, my code, http://jsfiddle.net/rTus6/
[05:37:49] <johnkpaul> ha, don't read that
[05:37:52] <johnkpaul> not what I thought it was
[05:38:28] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: the binding of "this" is something that you need to learn in javascript
[05:38:35] <johnkpaul> not completely straightforward
[05:38:50] <johnkpaul> stolen from ecmabot.... If a function is called on an object, object.y(), then `this` within `y` refers to `object`. If called directly: y(), `this` refers to the global object - for browsers it's `window`. `this` can be set explicitly by using y.call(thisArg, argument1, argument2, ...), or with  .apply() and .bind().  For further explanation, see: http://killdream.github.com/blog/2011/10/understanding-javascript-oop/#sec
[05:38:50] <johnkpaul> -2-2
[05:42:04] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to tell how many "generations" down one dom element is from another?
[05:44:14] <Elephphant> johnkpaul, http://pastebin.com/AHNhyRhG - Example of use - I am already storing the reference
[05:44:47] <granden> johnkpaul: Woops, thought I was in the correct channel. :)
[05:44:53] <granden> Sorry
[05:48:26] <wirelessdreamer> I'm trying to hide all children of the parent of an object with a given class using: $('table.master').children('.comment').hide();
[05:48:53] <wirelessdreamer> if I remove the filter '.comment' it hides everything, but I don't get to filter, any ideas what happening?
[05:56:38] <CodesStuff1> .tmpl is more useful than I thought it would be. Anyone know of any other additions to the plugin?
[05:56:39] <b-ot> CodesStuff1, memorised “tmpl”.
[05:56:53] <CodesStuff1> wat.
[05:56:54] <b-ot> Ok, best is to wait and see, where is the wind direction showing.
[05:57:14] <CodesStuff1> Oh derp.
[05:59:11] <dabear> ?tmpl

[06:04:56] <javalover> guys everything about my site is cool now but...
[06:05:15] <javalover> the issue i'm having is I have a scrolling div...like mousescroll over the div...but if you scroll too hard it makes the browser scroll
[06:05:27] <javalover> how do I make it so that never happens?
[06:05:56] <javalover> I have to like override mousescroll on focus huh?
[06:07:18] <javalover> cuz heres the thing, it works fine but then if you scroll past the divs final scroll position, it will scroll the page.
[06:07:27] <javalover> and that's not good cuz I like to scroll quickly through the feed & then it jumps
[06:07:50] <javalover> but other then that, this site is BOMB! can't believe I made this *CLAP CLAP CLAP*
[06:08:04] <Whirl3d> url?
[06:09:17] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: .postJSON?
[06:09:52] <CodesStuff1> I've never run across that, javalover. I think you'll either have to hack something together with timers, or patch the func
[06:10:08] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: you're saving the context as row, but not using it in your callback
[06:10:08] <Elephphant> just an extension method, does same as getJSON but in post. Thanks for the help but ive come up with another solution.
[06:10:11] <Whirl3d> javalover, you have been coming here long enough now to know that we either need a link to live content or a fiddle to help with a question that specific.
[06:10:20] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: ah ok, no proble
[06:10:47] <Elephphant> johnkpaul, I am, where its important, but it wasn't working there so I didnt change it in the other places
[06:10:57] <Elephphant> $("img",row) is where i was testing it
[06:11:16] <Elephphant> its still annoying, i'd like to know why it isn't working but it seems to have no reason to not be .
[06:11:28] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: hmm, I dont' think I understand your goal any longer
[06:11:50] <johnkpaul> also, row.find('img') is faster and imho, more understandable, than $('img', row)
[06:11:50] <Elephphant> johnkpaul, How do you mean
[06:12:18] <johnkpaul> you want to make line 36 in your paste use the this from outside of the callback, correct?
[06:13:06] <Elephphant> Line 33
[06:13:22] <Elephphant> ignore 36, its not needed if 33 works
[06:14:20] <johnkpaul> so Elephphant, what is line 33 returning?
[06:15:00] <Elephphant> Its only adding a class to the last row, the each looping through eacch row in a table
[06:15:09] <Elephphant> line 33 adding a class to image in that row
[06:26:47] <CodesStuff1> Anyone know of a way using CSS to limit text length within a div? (similar to min/max-width)
[06:27:14] <seutje> johnkpaul: I remember seeing a talk by John about how he rewrote some stuff so $('foo', context) and $(context).find('foo') were equal, performance-wise, but I can't seem to find any reference to it, so I might be tripping
[06:27:23] <seutje> but I agree that it's more readable
[06:27:45] <johnkpaul> ?g text-overflow @CodesStuff1
[06:27:46] <bot-t> CodesStuff1, text-overflow - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/text-overflow
[06:27:47] <faraway> CodesStuff1: what do you mean exactly with limit the text length ?  that it is truncated and … are added ?
[06:28:02] <johnkpaul> seutje: oh really? I'd like to see that, but really, I care more about the readability than the performance incrase
[06:28:20] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: is ther eany way that I can see the running code, nothing _seems_ wrong with the way you've written it
[06:28:35] <seutje> johnkpaul: I think the talk was given at bocoup
[06:28:48] <Elephphant> unfortunately no
[06:28:50] <Elephphant> unfortunately not
[06:28:52] <sunbeam> I've got a WP blog. Each post, I would like my users to be able to Tweet the post, by clicking on the twitter icon link thats placed on each post. How do I get the correct link for that anchor?
[06:29:02] <johnkpaul> seutje: thanks, I'll look it up sometime
[06:29:31] <seutje> think it's this one, but not sure http://loft.bocoup.com/john-resig-advanced-jquery/
[06:31:32] <johnkpaul> thanks, added to instapaper queue
[06:31:39] <johnkpaul> Elephphant: can you log out row to the console
[06:31:43] <johnkpaul> for each iteration of the loop
[06:35:05] <Elephphant> johnkpaul: http://pastebin.com/VNjH6Edd
[06:35:20] <Elephphant> 5 ajax calls
[06:35:33] <Elephphant> those are the call back console returns
[06:35:59] <johnkpaul> ah Elephphant, where is your var before row
[06:36:02] <johnkpaul> didn't notice this
[06:36:06] <johnkpaul> you're setting the global row
[06:36:07] <johnkpaul> window.row
[06:36:08] <Elephphant> ?
[06:36:21] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn var keyword @ Elephphant
[06:36:22] <bot-t> Elephphant, var - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
[06:36:24] <Elephphant> ah
[06:36:26] <Elephphant> ofc
[06:36:44] <johnkpaul> had to look up ofc, but yup :)
[06:37:22] <Elephphant> ill check
[06:37:23] <CodesStuff1> oh sorry johnkpaul - yes! text-overflow was EXACTLY what I needed
[06:37:26] <Elephphant> but sounds likely
[06:37:26] <CodesStuff1> thanks a ton
[06:37:34] <johnkpaul> no problem CodesStuff1, have fun
[06:39:02] <Elephphant> johnkpaul, that works. Thanks. Thats been annoying the hell out of me
[06:39:27] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[06:39:37] <johnkpaul> consider using a js linter to avoid mistakes like that
[06:40:05] <ThemNuts> Hi guys, i got this function that, when clicking a button send an sms (via a voip provider) to a router to stop and start it remotely. Now i got all this working but i want to have it that when the button is clicked the spinner (loading) only spins as long as the script runs. Now it keeps running without stopping ever.
[06:40:12] <ThemNuts> this is my code: http://pastebin.com/reGYf92r i tried with delay() but that won't work
[06:40:27] <ThemNuts> and i don't understand anything of that .get result
[06:41:35] <ThemNuts> when i do var result = get(....) it gives me 'object' when i print it
[06:42:01] <faraway> hmm .. how can i move the content of one element to another … currently i use wrapInner move the element to the other and then do unwrap
[06:42:04] <ThemNuts> only thing i want to know is if the script is finished and when it is, stop() the spinner and show the button
[06:45:06] <faraway> currently it looks like this but that'S not really nice: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/vQtYm/
[06:47:02] <criten> Hey guys, i'm looking to slected a class based off of the vlue of the clicked element. Is this easy?
[06:47:22] <mazzachre> criten: yes
[06:48:12] <criten> mazzachre: I've tried throwing $(this).val as the slection, is that somewhat correct?
[06:49:05] <mazzachre> criten: Almost... $(this).val()
[06:49:08] <g0rd0n> $("input").removeClass('wrong'); <- i want to remove that class from all <input ...> elements, but it doesnt work... what am i doing wrong?
[06:49:20] <mazzachre> $($(this).val()).whatever();
[06:49:38] <criten> mazzachre: Let me play around with it more... thanks for the input
[06:50:22] <g0rd0n> roget it, i'm getting tired
[06:50:26] <g0rd0n> forgot to reload the page :P
[06:52:28] <criten> mazzachre: So much closer! it's working now.. but in order to have it select the class to i need to insert a period at the begining?
[06:52:38] <criten> do i*
[06:53:16] <criten> mazzachre: The value i have is "a" so it's hiding all of my links... but i want it to select the class 'a'
[06:53:35] <mazzachre> criten: yes, then you need a dot in front...
[06:56:05] <criten> mazzachre: $("."+$(this).val()).something();
[06:56:33] <criten> mazzachre: how do i go about adding the dot... that doesn't seem to work, and i thought adding strings you just use the add operator
[06:57:15] <mazzachre> criten: That ought to do it though...
[06:57:32] <stevenhong> (?<!\\)\\n
[06:58:23] <stevenhong> anyone knows this regular expression means?
[06:59:14] <mazzachre> stevenhong: Oh damned... I though it was a sexting message...
[06:59:38] <faraway> stevenhong: find al \\n that don't have \\ infornt
[07:00:06] <faraway> stevenhong: (?<!  … ) means not in front of

[07:04:20] <ThemNuts> figured it out: $.get('reboothotspot.php?hotspot=".$hotspot."&rrgsmnr=".$RRGsmnr."', function(){ spinner.stop(); $('#RebootIt').show(); });
[07:05:14] <jeffsmykil> If Im making a tree with UL and LI is it a bad idea to store data in each LI?
[07:10:31] <DarkSector> Hello, I'd like to let a user select multiple images shown in a grid and when he hits the submit button the names will be stored in an array and will be passed as a request. How do I do that?
[07:10:40] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil. why would it be a bad idea?
[07:12:01] <Whirl3d> DarkSector, perhaps you can get someone to do your work for you, but my experience has been that it works best in this channel if you try to figure it out (maybe google it) and then when you get stuck, we have something to work with. Otherwise, there's a million ways to do what you want.
[07:12:32] <DarkSector> Whirl3d: :|
[07:12:38] <Whirl3d> I don't know of any plugins, for example, that do what you are looking for
[07:12:48] <Whirl3d> but it shouldn't be too hard
[07:13:01] <DarkSector> Isn't there a plugin that allows multiple divs to be selected?
[07:13:14] <Whirl3d> Are you asking me to google it for you?
[07:13:19] <DarkSector> oh god
[07:13:20] <DarkSector> thanks man.

[07:14:41] <johnkpaul> the blog is down at the moment, so I can't just do ?helpfulhelp for you
[07:14:49] <johnkpaul> bookmark that
[07:16:03] <Whirl3d> that is a laugh riot. I bookmarked it immediately. LOL
[07:16:54] <Whirl3d> I love the part about make sure your solving a problem that needs to be solved. Man that is my life.
[07:17:49] <johnkpaul> haha
[07:20:15] <Whirl3d> understand that you will be criticized over everything everyone thinks you’re doing wrong or in a bad way.
[07:20:46] <Whirl3d> that is sooo funny. Though I gotta say that this channel is awfully generous and forgiving for the most part
[07:20:57] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's purposeful, and I'm very happy about it
[07:21:10] <johnkpaul> that's actually a really good post for most of life
[07:21:17] <johnkpaul> that kind of humility is very helpful in others and yourself
[07:22:11] <Whirl3d> I'm always shocked when someone comes right out and says: No, you're wrong. I try not to tell anyone that they are wrong just in case I'm not right.
[07:22:13] <mg983> Hi guys. My current site uses jQuery in noconflict mode (and I can't change that) -- now I am including an external script from a service provider that uses $ as the jQuery identifier -- is there any way that I can include the script and tell it to treat $ as jQuery without basically copying the file to my server and replacing all $ to jQuery ?
[07:22:23] <surfdue> anyone use datatables
[07:23:22] <Attmattic> i just used it the other day surfdue
[07:24:06] <surfdue> I have an ajax data source that dynamically loads and the sorting works great for fields in the database.. however some fields are not in the database they are displayed as text on the final output to datatabes.
[07:24:22] <surfdue> Any idea how to send the sort/search to ajax as it is except for 1 or 2 columns.
[07:24:31] <surfdue> I want it to just sort by the final string
[07:24:34] <faraway> mg983: you load the script with "script"-tags in html ?
[07:24:49] <mg983> faraway: yes
[07:25:15] <Whirl3d> mg983, have faith there is a way. I'm not sure of the syntax, but basically you create a function that has the $ as it's parameter, then you pass that function the jQuery object...wrapping it all around your other code. I'll look it up  though.
[07:25:23] <Attmattic> not sure surfdue..
[07:25:25] <faraway> mg983: the script that are loaded via html are executed in the order they appear in the dom (expect when you ad asyc)
[07:25:29] <mattfield> mg983: wrap your code in an anonymous function
[07:26:01] <mg983> yeah I am looking into that now, I wanted to know if ther was a way to include the actual JS file without finding every time it is referenced and wrapping it around an anonymous function
[07:26:13] <Attmattic> Cant you just load you data to a table and then throw datatables on the table id it should sort those fields
[07:26:18] <mattfield> mg983: (function($) { …all your code… } })(jQuery);
[07:26:49] <mattfield> Hmm. I'm not sure there is.
[07:26:50] <Whirl3d> ta da! That's it! mattfield++
[07:26:53] <mg983> mattfield - the .js file i am including with script tags from a 3rd party is being referenced all over the place with jQuery
[07:27:01] <CodesStuff1> so... quick question. Think I'll get sued? http://oi47.tinypic.com/2pqu91t.jpg :D
[07:27:38] <faraway> mg983: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/JBGP7/
[07:27:54] <Whirl3d> CodeStuff1, is it worth the risk?
[07:28:09] <mg983> faraway thanks!
[07:28:09] <faraway> mg983: hope you get what i want to tell :D
[07:28:22] <mg983> faraway: yeah - i understand the concept :)
[07:28:29] <CodesStuff1> Whirl3d: Everything is worth the risk
[07:28:57] <faraway> mg983: cause the scripts are executed in order you shouldn't get problems if the $ is used somehow else
[07:29:07] <Whirl3d> not climbing mount everest after 2 pm---ceraint death
[07:29:15] <Whirl3d> certain*
[07:29:40] <faraway> mg983: only if the 3d party script does some document.write , then you could get problems
[07:29:45] <CodesStuff1> lol
[07:29:52] <Whirl3d> same colors, same typeface, obvious ripoff, though.
[07:29:57] <CodesStuff1> Whirl3d: it's just an instagram client I've made
[07:30:06] <CodesStuff1> but it's the only unofficial one that can upload pics
[07:30:08] <Whirl3d> Maybe that's okay then
[07:30:12] <CodesStuff1> So chances are it will be popular
[07:30:20] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I don't think that "you're wrong" is necessarily the right approach, but fairly often, it's true
[07:30:24] <CodesStuff1> The thing is... you're not supposed to be able to upload photos.
[07:30:45] <johnkpaul> and it's ok that you tell people that, as long as you have the right solution available, or cna point them in the right direction
[07:30:45] <mattfield> mg983 && faraway: yeah, that could be an issue. but as long as there's nothing in the external script that messed the execution order you should be ok
[07:30:54] <johnkpaul> that's what's so helpful about the bot, and being able to send google results
[07:30:56] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul are you trying to say that I am usually wrong. LOL
[07:31:04] <Whirl3d> just kidding
[07:31:09] <johnkpaul> :) no, not at all
[07:33:10] <Whirl3d> The thing that I have found is that it's good to be secure about your knowledge base. It gives you more opportunities to learn and it's not so hurtful when someone calls you out for a mistake.
[07:34:08] <mattfield> If I might add my option to the discussion too, I think it's very easy to become far too protective of the code one writes.
[07:34:14] <mattfield> *opinion
[07:34:22] <Whirl3d> I pretty much never get my feelings hurt (it has happened) because daily I see so many people on here that know so much more than I do--I learn new stuff every day.
[07:34:34] <CodesStuff1> Whirl3d is a big dumb face who eats poop.
[07:34:41] <CodesStuff1> Take that!
[07:34:45] <Whirl3d> I have seen that, mattfield.
[07:35:03] <mattfield> criticism, even if its constructive, will be taken so personally if that's the case
[07:35:08] <Whirl3d> CodeStuff1, do you kiss your momma with that mouth?
[07:35:23] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I feel that same way, no one knows everything, everyone's been called out here for being mistaken
[07:35:34] <NodeX> some more than others!
[07:35:36] <johnkpaul> I've learned much much more about jquery, internals and api by being in this channel
[07:35:38] <CodesStuff1> No. My mother died two months ago of cancer.
[07:35:46] <johnkpaul> even when I Dont' say anything and just read whenever I can, I learn something
[07:36:17] <jeffsmykil> does data not work on list items?
[07:36:26] <johnkpaul> mattfield: yeah, taking your code personally is something that you have to work on to go away
[07:36:32] <Whirl3d> I was talking to Shoky about how we should compile a "best of jquery IRC" book with the standard questions and funny comments.
[07:36:32] <johnkpaul> or taking code criicism rather
[07:36:34] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: yes, it does
[07:36:41] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[07:36:49] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ jeffsmykil
[07:36:50] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:36:51] <mattfield> johnkpaul: absolutely, yeah.
[07:37:17] <jeffsmykil> ...I didn't even ask a specific code question lol
[07:37:22] <jeffsmykil> i asked you about functionality
[07:37:31] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I assumed that you were having a problem with getting data to work on list items :)
[07:37:40] <johnkpaul> $.data works with any dom elements
[07:37:53] <NodeX> jeffsmykil : afaik data-* works on all attributes
[07:38:00] <NodeX> dom element s*
[07:38:05] <NodeX> tfi friday lol
[07:39:37] <jeffsmykil> Friday indeed
[07:40:03] <NodeX> what's making your $,data not work?
[07:40:27] <NodeX> err ... what's not working about it *
[07:40:41] <jeffsmykil> yeah, that's what im trying to figure out
[07:40:52] <NodeX> setting or getting?
[07:40:54] <jeffsmykil> i think it has something to do with my selector
[07:41:05] <mattfield> jeffsmykil: have you got any examples you could show us?
[07:41:05] <jeffsmykil> my selector is funky
[07:41:06] <jeffsmykil> $("#li-" + infected2[0].ElementId)
[07:41:12] <amcsi_work> hello
[07:41:28] <jeffsmykil> it works when I put it on "body"
[07:41:31] <NodeX> console.log(infected2[0].ElementId);
[07:41:36] <mbrochh> i'm quite lost... I can't figure out how to use the jQuery ui buttons with icons... i just see a normal button, no icons or styles attached at all
[07:41:42] <NodeX> make sure it's got a value or the expected value
[07:41:45] <amcsi_work> how do I subscribe to a click event on an element only if the click was made on the element, and wssn'T bubbled up from a descendant element
[07:41:46] <amcsi_work> ?
[07:42:13] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: yeah it does
[07:42:28] <NodeX> and  the li with that id exists?
[07:42:53] <faraway> amcsi_work: check http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/  there you have currentTarget
[07:43:06] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: yeah checking it
[07:43:11] <johnkpaul> amcsi_work: http://jsfiddle.net/zKxqv/
[07:43:40] <johnkpaul> check your console, you can compare this to event.target
[07:43:44] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: $('#something').on('click',function(ev) { var el = $(ev.target); console.log(el); });
[07:43:48] <amcsi_work> thx
[07:43:56] <johnkpaul> :) NoiseEee, faraway, we were on it
[07:44:02] <NoiseEee> heh
[07:44:13] <faraway> :P
[07:47:04] <Kingsy> guys, I am changing the background image on an element on a timeout.. however the background image that is being displayed in the background isnt preloaded.. how would you go about preloading all of the images you are going to use?
[07:47:18] <Kingsy> just insert hidden img tags on the page? cos that seems nasty
[07:47:43] <burzum> im doing this $(".notes-table").tableScroll({ ... when the page has loaded, i have the case that the table can be empty at this time. when i then add rows to it via ajax, how can i re-initialize that tableScroll()? i need to run that method again because its calculating some width and hights based on the tr's in the tbody.
[07:47:53] <faraway> Kingsy: you gan use "new Image()" and set the src for it store it somewhere
[07:48:14] <Kingsy> faraway: hmm I am not sure what you mean...
[07:48:21] <faraway> Kingsy: i make a smaple
[07:48:56] <mattfield> burzum: you could call tableScroll on your table in the ajax callback
[07:49:05] <burzum> just call it again?
[07:49:21] <mattfield> yep
[07:49:26] <faraway> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/zGhgK/
[07:50:00] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: it was just a careless selector error elsewehere
[07:50:36] <Kingsy> faraway: so imageCache would be an array filled with all of the images you are going to use?
[07:50:46] <mg983> I found the root of my issue!
[07:51:18] <mg983> A plugin I am using for wordpress is introducing <script type='text/javascript'>try{jQuery.noConflict();}catch(e){};</script> right after it includes the <script> to add in jquery - how can I undo that without updating the plugin ?
[07:51:49] <LindsayMac> mg983:  you can unregister a script in WP functions
[07:51:57] <mg983> no no no
[07:52:04] <mg983> i need to undo the call <script type='text/javascript'>try{jQuery.noConflict();}catch(e){};</script>
[07:52:07] <mg983> is it just $ = jquery?
[07:52:16] <LindsayMac> Ohhhh oops. Sorry
[07:52:56] <faraway> Kingsy: yes, it is not the best solution, but depending on what you do this will be ok
[07:53:26] <LindsayMac> mg983:  this might help http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16494
[07:53:40] <MaxymiserTE> Hi. I am having an issue with setting up an attribute on an element with jQuery. It seems to work in the Firebug Console but will refuse to apply the ID element I request to put in.
[07:53:46] <faraway> Kingsy: this is more an hint how to load images without creating a dom element then a final solution
[07:54:30] <MaxymiserTE> Ideally the code: $('#rates-to-apply .right ul li .link.line a').attr('id','local-branch-locator'); should set "id="local-branch-locator" to the anchor tag
[07:54:50] <mg983> LindsayMac: yeah I saw that a few days ago, damn all other libraries!
[07:54:51] <mattfield> MaxymiserTE: do you have a jsFiddle to show us? Are you loading the anchor dynamically?
[07:54:59] <LindsayMac> mg983:  lol
[07:55:27] <MaxymiserTE> the page is: http://dev3.maxymiser.com/lp3/ (the link in the footer "find a local branch")
[07:56:24] <Davey> So, I have an element that is overflow: auto; how can I make it scroll to the bottom whenever content is appended to it?
[07:56:59] <johnkpaul> ?scrollTop @Davey
[07:57:00] <bot-t> Davey, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[07:57:12] <xrdodrx> is there a way to use a jquery function on a variable isnteada of a DOM element?
[07:57:18] <Davey> johnkpaul: that… doesn't help me at all :)
[07:57:19] <mattfield> your selector is wrong
[07:57:30] <LindsayMac> I am having an issue with the scrollbar not working anywhere on my site. I disabled it purposely on the home page, but purposely did NOT call the script on subsequent pages so as not to interfere. I can not find out why that us causing this conflict. Here's a link to a page with content that overflows http://www.millwrightsrestaurant.com/2012/07/28/this-is-a-longer-article-written-about-millwrights/
[07:57:35] <johnkpaul> Davey: why not? did you read the docs?
[07:57:40] <mattfield> there shouldn't be a space between 'li' and '.link.line'
[07:57:49] <MaxymiserTE> How come it worked in the console?
[07:57:50] <johnkpaul> Davey: .scrollTop(el.scrollHeight)
[07:57:58] <MaxymiserTE> I'll try that
[07:58:06] <johnkpaul> xrdodrx: what jquery function, what are you trying to do?
[07:58:11] <Davey> johnkpaul: sure, but how do I know where to place it? :)
[07:58:32] <johnkpaul> where to place the code?
[07:58:41] <MaxymiserTE> oh thanks, mattfield. that worked.
[07:58:43] <johnkpaul> after you append the element, Davey
[07:58:54] <Davey> johnkpaul: eh? How do I know the size of the scrollable area?
[07:58:59] <mattfield> MaxymiserTE: you're very welcome
[07:59:13] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn scrollHeight @Davey
[07:59:14] <bot-t> Davey, element.scrollHeight - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[07:59:25] <rethus> i search for a prototype irc, which is alive. i have to change something in prototype... for jquery i got it in 5 seconds.. in prototype, i need some advice
[07:59:27] <Davey> ah, thanks johnkpaul :)
[07:59:35] <johnkpaul> no problem, Davey, have fun
[08:00:03] <rethus> maybe someone here knows... how can i use my js-vars, i got in source, from Ajax.Updater() in prototype
[08:00:21] <burzum> mattfield this does not work for me, i guess the reason is there additonal markup it adds stays and does not get renewed by the plugin
[08:01:13] <mattfield> burzum, do you have a working copy to look at?
[08:01:49] <MaxymiserTE> Also, will that new ID created be available to the $('id').click(function() {});  or will a delay need to be added?
[08:02:12] <burzum> mattfield sorry, no, im not allowed to show the site, its an application for LAN for a company
[08:02:56] <mattfield> I'm not sure I follow MaxymiserTE.
[08:03:16] <MaxymiserTE> I put an alert in the $('#branch-locator'
[08:03:17] <mattfield> If the id gets added to the element before you attach a click handler, then yes.
[08:03:21] <MaxymiserTE> ').click
[08:03:32] <MaxymiserTE> and it doesnt seem to work
[08:04:26] <mattfield> try using a console.log instead and see if you get anything logged
[08:05:36] <mattfield> burzum, that kind of makes sense. are you passing the required arguments when you call the plugin again?
[08:05:54] <burzum> yes
[08:07:00] <mattfield> MaxymiserTE: just tried to attach a click handler through the console and it worked fine.
[08:07:19] <mattfield> burzum: I'm not sure how else to help without being able to see any markup
[08:07:35] <burzum> i have an idea :)
[08:07:44] <mattfield> :)
[08:07:51] <burzum> i'll remove the wrapper it adds and add the table back, and then reinit, maybe it works
[08:07:52] <MaxymiserTE> Also, now its changing the ID for both the branch locator and the download form links. i have no way of setting two different IDs for those links\
[08:08:01] <burzum> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170004/how-to-remove-only-the-parent-element-and-not-its-child-elements-in-javascript
[08:08:22] <MaxymiserTE> download link is within class="link" and branch is within class="link line"
[08:08:46] <mattfield> ah, I see. I figured you'd be clearing out the elements with each ajax call. that could be causing an issue :)
[08:09:10] <LindsayMac> d'oh.. never mind my silly question
[08:09:23] <MaxymiserTE> #rates-to-apply .right ul li.link.line a { } for branch,  #rates-to-apply .right ul li.link a { } for download
[08:09:38] <mattfield> MaxymiserTE: yeah, I just attached a click to that and it fired just fine
[08:10:13] <MaxymiserTE> the differentiator is .line class but it is applying the same ID to both links
[08:10:24] <slartsa> http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/10/ How could I let the visitor click the category link here so that it would open all content below it?
[08:10:41] <slartsa> I've told to chain it but I haven't got a clue how
[08:10:49] <slartsa> *been
[08:11:13] <mattfield> that's not surprising, "#rates-to-apply .right ul li.link a" will target both links
[08:11:28] <faraway> MaxymiserTE: just because i curious  do you think you should get an alert here ? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/ns2YB/
[08:11:39] <mattfield> what's the reason for wanting to add an ID dynamically rather that straight into your markup?
[08:11:56] <faraway> MaxymiserTE: if you click on test
[08:12:06] <mattfield> faraway: that won't fire the click function
[08:12:23] <faraway> mattfield: yes i know just wondering if this is MaxymiserTE problem ;)
[08:12:30] <mattfield> ah ;)
[08:12:49] <faraway> i don't know how i should explain it otherwise :D
[08:13:06] <MaxymiserTE> We focus on making changes on the fly for clients for multivariate testing. we don't have access to the code
[08:13:21] <mattfield> yeah faraday is totally right, as mentioned earlier. you need to assign the id to the element before binding any events to them, otherwise jQuery won't find the element to bind to  :)
[08:13:21] <MaxymiserTE> if we did, i would be able to put the ID directly
[08:13:40] <mattfield> so you don't have access to the markup?
[08:13:59] <mattfield> or you aren't allowed to change it?
[08:14:06] <faraway> or use $(document).on("click","#your-id", … )
[08:14:27] <MaxymiserTE>   $('#rates-to-apply .right ul li.link.line a').attr('id','local-branch-locator');
[08:14:29] <MaxymiserTE>   
[08:14:31] <MaxymiserTE>   $('#local-branch-locator').click(function() {
[08:14:33] <MaxymiserTE>       alert('local branch tracked');
[08:14:35] <MaxymiserTE>   });
[08:14:58] <MaxymiserTE> I assigned the id to this one, then used the ID in the click event. in the console it works but not in the site directly
[08:15:30] <MaxymiserTE> Could this be DOM ordering issue? I tried window.setTimeout(...,0) or onload, no luck
[08:15:35] <mattfield> yeah works fine from the console. there might be something wrong with the execution order
[08:15:45] <derekpioneer> can anyone offer some direction for getting jquery draggable to track properly inside a rotated div? http://jsfiddle.net/Fsqm3/
[08:15:56] <derekpioneer> jquery ui draggable*
[08:16:03] <mattfield> it's not worth getting tangled up in setTimeouts, trust me! causes a whole world of trouble
[08:16:38] <MaxymiserTE> So I am not able to use the click handler function to my ID?
[08:16:42] <xrdodrx> sometimes it's unavoidable mattfield
[08:16:45] <derekpioneer> if i drag a box around inside a rotated div (see example) the box goes all over the place and does not follow the mouse
[08:16:51] <MaxymiserTE> even if it is after the declaration?
[08:16:57] <xrdodrx> if javascript had a simple sleep() function, life would be so much easier :p
[08:17:11] <mattfield> xrdodrx, there are usually ways around. I really think setTimeouts should be avoided unless it's absolutely necessary
[08:17:34] <mattfield> there are absolutely situations when it's needed though, I agree
[08:17:45] <smellynoser> webdev
[08:17:47] <rabbi1> i am using jquery UI tabs, if i have select a all items (say <li class="red">) in a tab where 'tab' is dynamic. and set to variable. how can i do it?   var tabTest = $('tabs .red'); is it correct ?
[08:17:58] <xrdodrx> mattfield: in the script i'm working on now it definitely is necessary. it does a bunch of page loads from a server and i need to let the server rest a little between loads ;)
[08:18:08] <mattfield> xrdodrx: :D
[08:18:17] <faraway> MaxymiserTE: could you tell me what console.log("count: "+ $('#local-branch-locator').length); returns at the place where you do the $('#local-branch-locator').click
[08:19:13] <mattfield> count: 1
[08:19:22] <mattfield> as expected
[08:19:39] <mattfield> *should be expected, rather :)
[08:19:43] <faraway> ;)
[08:20:07] <rabbi1> faraway: you know about a place called 'far far away' ?
[08:20:34] <mattfield> or, just pop your id assignment into your code, and run $('#local-branch-locator').length straight from the console
[08:21:00] <martisj> nighty
[08:21:08] <mattfield> or, use web inspector on the element and check if the ID is there in the markup :)
[08:21:59] <nFFF> http://www.mrporter.com/product/194809 click on a header on right
[08:22:01] <MaxymiserTE>  Another issue, i think its confusing jquery
[08:22:02] <nFFF> how is this animation done
[08:22:07] <nFFF> doesnt look like its done with jquery?
[08:22:13] <nFFF> I cant get my animations this smooth
[08:22:17] <MaxymiserTE> because it is assigning my ID to the download link as well
[08:22:40] <mattfield> confusing jQuery?
[08:22:43] <faraway> rabbi1: the one of shrek ?
[08:22:52] <rabbi1> yeap :D
[08:22:53] <MaxymiserTE> how do i call it differently? they both have the parent class of "link"
[08:23:19] <rabbi1> late reply? googled it ? lol
[08:23:27] <MaxymiserTE> they are both in the same css structure except the branch is "link line" and download is just "link"
[08:24:01] <johnkpaul> nFFF: what is "a hreader on the right"?
[08:24:02] <faraway> rabbi1: hehe no
[08:24:04] <MaxymiserTE> i tried with nth-child(1) and nth-child(2), doesn't help
[08:24:21] <mattfield> $('#rates-to-apply .right ul li:eq(2)')
[08:24:35] <mattfield> $('#rates-to-apply .right ul li:eq(2) > a'), sorry
[08:24:57] <MaxymiserTE> eq() starts at 1 or 0?
[08:25:06] <mattfield> starts at 0, it's zero-indexed
[08:25:21] <nFFF> johnkpaul, the sub menus on right of image
[08:25:26] <nFFF> size, editors notes etc
[08:25:34] <nFFF> when you click one, it auto expands hidden content
[08:25:41] <nFFF> I cant replicate this smoothness on my page
[08:26:00] <xrdodrx> Any idea why innerHTML() would work when .text() wouldn't? :s
[08:26:24] <rabbi1> mattfield: can u help me on this? I am passing an object (i.e, entire tab object) to a variable and if i have select all element with class name 'red'  in that tab (variable) what should i do ? var redElement = $('tab .red') . is this correct ?
[08:27:01] <faraway> rabbi1: i switch from coding to reading the channel, so even if i get highlighted i not directly look into the channel if i do some coding
[08:27:04] <MaxymiserTE> wow, it was just a duplicate ID that caused my alerts not to work
[08:27:13] <johnkpaul> nFFF: why do you think it's _not_ jquery?
[08:27:15] <johnkpaul> it's not a css transition
[08:27:16] <slartsa> http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/10/ could someone help me out how do i chain that so that categories are also links, that would load the content of their child links?
[08:27:25] <MaxymiserTE> would nth-child work, just curious
[08:27:42] <nFFF> johnkpaul, becuase Im using jQuery and mine staggers/isn't smooth
[08:27:47] <nFFF> and theres is flawless :D
[08:27:57] <mattfield> rabbi1: what are you trying to give to .red? the whole object?
[08:27:58] <johnkpaul> :) that's probably for different reasons nFFF
[08:28:36] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/dDwBv/
[08:28:37] <rabbi1> mattfield: trying to validate all elements in the tab
[08:28:40] <nFFF> IT smooth in jsfiddle
[08:28:46] <nFFF> but on my site its unsmooth as possible
[08:28:52] <rabbi1> and enable the next tab on true or false
[08:28:55] <nFFF> it does the animation in like 3-4 steps
[08:29:06] <scathen^C> hey guys, any suggestions for time between feed refreshing on my social network site?
[08:29:25] <mattfield> rabbi1: I'm not 100% certain I understand what you're trying to do…but to start with $('tab') won't select anything
[08:29:30] <johnkpaul> ah nFFF, the mrporter animations are all to the same height
[08:29:36] <johnkpaul> yours is just slideDown
[08:29:48] <johnkpaul> if you look, mrporter's height does not take into account the content
[08:29:49] <mattfield> if you're calling the variable 'tab' then it should be $(tab) without the quote marks
[08:30:00] <rabbi1> mattfield: tab = [div#tabname];
[08:30:10] <nFFF> johnkpaul, ok and does this improve the transition
[08:30:16] <nFFF> I havent really used transitions before
[08:31:08] <mattfield> try setting up var tab = $(div#tabname), then you can just call tab without wrapping it in jQ
[08:31:12] <rabbi1> mattfield: yeah, with out quote and then under that (tab) i have to target all elements with class name 'red'
[08:31:30] <faraway> scathen^C: if your server can handle it, you could start a request and hold this until there is something to update and send it, then you have realtime response
[08:31:45] <mattfield> ah, ok, in that case just $(tab + ' .red')
[08:32:21] <mattfield> concatenate the data in the variable and a string with the class name
[08:32:54] <faraway> scathen^C: otherwise it really depends on how often something changes. you e.g. could adjust the resquest time on the current update frequency.
[08:33:03] <rabbi1> mattfield: also, tab has id and class name as well
[08:33:11] <johnkpaul> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/dDwBv/1/
[08:33:24] <mattfield> ok, is that a problem?
[08:33:45] <rabbi1> mattfield: $(tab + '.red') will be something like [div#tabname.classname .red] ... is it ?
[08:33:54] <mattfield> yep
[08:34:06] <rabbi1> mattfield: that sounds perfect, let me check.. thank you
[08:34:08] <rabbi1> :)
[08:34:14] <mattfield> hope it works for you :)
[08:34:24] <nFFF> johnkpaul this is mrptorter code
[08:34:25] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tCPMz/
[08:35:01] <johnkpaul> nFFF: did you take a look at what I sent you? do you find that better?
[08:35:24] <nFFF> Moment
[08:35:29] <nFFF> Your code only allows one click
[08:36:07] <rabbi1> mattfield: i just tried this: var something = $(tab + '.red'); console.log(something); console give me just empty array ' [ ] '
[08:36:36] <mattfield> make sure you've got a space in ' .red'
[08:36:46] <djbpython> im trying to use the google translate widget in a jquery mobile app, but it REALLY screws up the UI. Any one been down this road before?

[08:37:21] <pppaul> hello peoples
[08:37:52] <pppaul> i'm doing a $.ajax and i want to set up my HTTP request to be all nice and proper
[08:38:09] <rabbi1> mattfield: nope, still the same
[08:38:25] <mattfield> and it definitely exists on the page?
[08:38:33] <mattfield> cause it sounds like it doesn't at the moment
[08:38:47] <nFFF> johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/dDwBv/2/
[08:38:50] <nFFF> ill try this
[08:38:54] <nFFF> not sure if it can be improved
[08:38:54] <johnkpaul> nFFF: I didn't make it work ocmpletely
[08:38:57] <johnkpaul> I just wanted to show you
[08:39:04] <pppaul> i am doing a HTTP PUT, and i want to add a Content-length to the request
[08:39:08] <johnkpaul> you can fix it to make it close and open again
[08:39:23] <manster>  hey guys i'm using image links for my sites menu items and would like them to automatically resize with the webpage, anyway to do this with good ol jq? http://jordanstabile.webu.us/
[08:39:24] <CodesStuff1> setRequestHeaders('Content-Length','blah');
[08:39:32] <pppaul> thank you
[08:39:46] <CodesStuff1> You might not be able to set them, though
[08:39:52] <nFFF> johnkpaul, same issue, it seems to have 3 parts to animation, it stutters when it opens, and when it closes
[08:39:54] <mattfield> setRequestHeader. singular.
[08:39:58] <CodesStuff1> oh derp
[08:39:59] <nFFF> like 5px before and 5p when closing
[08:40:00] <CodesStuff1> My bad
[08:40:00] <CodesStuff1> :LD
[08:40:01] <mattfield> :D
[08:40:05] <pppaul> i would like to do it via the options, though CodeStuff1 (using a lib that is doing the request for me)
[08:40:55] <mattfield> via the options, pppaul?
[08:41:14] <CodesStuff1> Hmm..you could manually patch it if the URL == X
[08:41:15] <pppaul> $.ajax(settings)
[08:41:24] <rabbi1> mattfield: missed me ?
[08:41:48] <pppaul> my program is indirectly doing the $.ajax call
[08:41:53] <CodesStuff1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7450803/how-to-set-request-header-strings
[08:42:04] <mattfield> rabbi1: I asked a little way back if the element(s) you're trying to target exist on the page, because it sounds like they don't if you getting an empty array passed back
[08:42:38] <derekpioneer> what does $('div').each() do? does it just iterate over the child elements of the div?
[08:42:54] <mattfield> derekpioneer: it iterates over all the divs
[08:43:19] <mattfield> rabbi1: load up your page, and go into web inspector/firebug and see if there are any elements in with the .red class.
[08:43:26] <pppaul> i guess it would be $.ajax({headers:{Content-length:'2342342'}})
[08:43:27] <derekpioneer> so $('.meh').each would iterate over each '.meh'?
[08:43:41] <rabbi1> mattfield: sorry, i missed you
[08:43:51] <mattfield> pppaul: with 'content-length' as a string, yeah
[08:44:28] <mattfield> pppaul: have a look here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:44:42] <mattfield> pppaul: under "The jqXHR Object"
[08:44:55] <rabbi1> mattfield: tab 1 has the class '.red' and tab 2 doesn't ... so jus trying to find all .red class elements, check for validations and then enable tab 2...
[08:45:09] <rabbi1> it's all in the same page, so .red exists in all
[08:45:13] <mattfield> pppaul: the jqXHR object exposes the setRequestHeader(name, value) method
[08:45:22] <mattfield> rabbi1: ok...
[08:46:14] <rabbi1> and console.log(tab) gives me this : [div#tabname.tabclassname]  so (tab + ' .red') doesn't give me [div#tabname.tabclassname .red] :(
[08:46:23] <pppaul> ok, i'll look into it. also, does it have a way to null out the current headers mattfield
[08:46:50] <mattfield> pppaul: so it's more like $.ajax({ beforeSend: function(req) { req.setRequestHeader('content-length', 'blahblah') } });
[08:47:03] <pppaul> thank you so much :D
[08:47:16] <mattfield> pppaul: if you pass in blank strings to the request, it'll overwrite the defaults, yeah
[08:47:19] <mattfield> pppaul: you're welcome :)
[08:47:54] <nFFF> Guys my animations on my site are choppy to start, smooth in the middle and choppy at the end. on jsfiddle they are fine
[08:47:55] <mattfield> so, rabbi1, are your div#tabname.tabclassname elements getting stored in an array, or is that just the way you're typing them here
[08:47:55] <mattfield> ?
[08:48:03] <nFFF> So it must be rest of my site
[08:48:08] <nFFF> but what could be effecting it
[08:48:12] <mattfield> nFFF: check the padding and margin of your elements
[08:48:15] <nFFF> I dont know where to look
[08:48:26] <rabbi1> mattfield: yeah, its in a array, i am typing it how its showing in conole (firebug) :)
[08:48:31] <mattfield> ah
[08:48:58] <mattfield> then you need to iterate over that array and do what you need to do at each index
[08:49:00] <nFFF> mattfield, there is none
[08:49:05] <nFFF> Alreayd removed them earlier :<
[08:49:20] <mattfield> rabbi1: I'll put a fiddle together for you
[08:49:34] <shmuppy> i'm not thinking clearly here, if i store a div with a class repeat to a variable, such as var repeat = $('#repeat');  and in a loop i want to $('container').after(repeat), am i doing something wrong?
[08:49:53] <shmuppy> well with the id repeat i mean~
[08:50:15] <rabbi1> mattfield: ok
[08:50:38] <shmuppy> it's not actually spitting out repeat's value, but if i would do a say .after(repeat.html()) it does in fact show whats inside of that container. i want that whole element spat out though.
[08:52:21] <mattfield> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/HchSf/
[08:52:44] <mattfield> rabbi1: whoops, sorry http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/HchSf/1/. this one :)
[08:52:54] <rabbi1> mattfield: thank you, I will add few more stuffs which i am doing it .....
[08:52:56] <rabbi1> oops
[08:53:47] <mattfield> shmuppy: what're you wanting to do with the div?
[08:53:57] <DarkGhost`> lets say I have a img pretty photo, when you click it, it opens pretty photo
[08:54:03] <DarkGhost`> how would I bind an event on the pretty photo
[08:54:07] <DarkGhost`> if it opens after the javascript?
[08:54:39] <mattfield> shmuppy: if you've got a div with an ID on it, there should only be one of the them in your markup, so you wouldn't need to iterate over a group of them
[08:54:46] <shmuppy> mattfield: sec, i'll just show you
[08:54:52] <shmuppy> yes ignore that i said id, one moment
[08:55:08] <mattfield> cool, ok shmuppy
[08:55:52] <shmup> thought you were just givin me a cute nickname
[08:56:16] <shmup> http://jsbin.com/opawup/1/edit
[08:56:18] <shmup> ignore the foreach mattfield
[08:57:18] <DarkGhost`> anyone?
[08:57:50] <shmup> mattfield: now that will not actually insert the repeat element, but if i would go say $(body).after(repeat.html()) it would at least output the <label>Hello!</label>, so I know I'm just doing something wrong
[08:58:02] <troll-boy> DarkGhost`, google you up some "shadow box" or "lightbox"
[08:58:05] <mattfield> shmup, so what are you trying to achieve here?
[08:58:21] <DarkGhost`> troll-boy, I need to know how to bind an event to something that happens after the fact
[08:58:34] <shmup> i just want the whole div element (repeat) to be able to be inserted over and over
[08:58:43] <shmup> by storing it to a variable
[08:59:07] <stevenhong> Why
[08:59:07] <stevenhong> 	var str = 'Helloworld\\\\\\n2012\n';
[08:59:07] <stevenhong> 	str = str.replace(/(?!\\\\)\\n/g, '\n');
[08:59:07] <stevenhong>     alert(str);
[08:59:07] <stevenhong> is : Helloworld\\
[08:59:07] <stevenhong> 2012
[08:59:11] <mattfield> DarkGhost`: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:59:12] <troll-boy> if I'm dynamically adding content to a accordian panel, instead of using a scroll how do I make it auto expand?
[08:59:15] <shmup> it will be inserted based on the count of some data in a json object, but thats irrelevent heh
[08:59:26] <troll-boy> stevenhong, pastebin
[08:59:40] <troll-boy> DarkGhost`, "something that happens after the fact" be more vague
[08:59:45] <mattfield> shmup, then just wrap the $(body).after(repeat) in a loop
[08:59:51] <stevenhong> pastebin? what?
[08:59:54] <shmup> i am, mattfield, nvm
[08:59:56] <stevenhong> more details
[09:00:02] <troll-boy> stevenhong, see the topic please.
[09:00:03] <mattfield> shmup, no you aren't
[09:00:17] <stevenhong> no javascript here?
[09:00:21] <mattfield> shmup, you're doing a forEach
[09:00:25] <troll-boy> stevenhong, this is the bit you ignored when you entered:  "jQuery 1.7.2 http://jquery.com - 1.8rc1 bit.ly/jq18rc1  | jQuery UI 1.8.22 http://jqueryui.com - 1.9b1 http://bit.ly/jqueryui19b1 | jQuery Mobile 1.1 http://jquerymobile.com | Docs: http://api.jquery.com | Paste code at http://jsfiddle.net | Mobile support #jquerymobile | Dev Channels #jquery-dev #jqueryui-dev #jquerymobile-dev | Channel publicly logged to http://irc.jquery.com/ ♥"
[09:00:40] <troll-boy> don't paste code here other than just a alert('hello world');
[09:00:41] <shmup> i said ignore the loop but in my code there is an actual $.each(offers, function (index, offer) { //code to repeat here }
[09:00:46] <troll-boy> anything longer than that, use a pastebin
[09:01:18] <shmup> i want to spit out the .repeat element in there, i am just missing the right way to do this in jquery. not trying to really spam in here. i know its really simple.
[09:01:42] <troll-boy> stevenhong, particularly pay attention to the part that says "Paste code at http://jsfiddle.net"
[09:01:42] <faraway> stevenhong: what do oyu expect that it should be ?
[09:01:57] <mattfield> if you're trying to CREATE a div with the class of repeat and store it in a variable, then it's var repeat = $('<div class="repeat"/>')
[09:02:11] <rabbi1> mattfield: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/134/
[09:02:18] <shmup> nvm, this is hard to communicate w/o being lengthy
[09:02:34] <mattfield> sorry, I just don't get what you're trying to do here shmup
[09:02:46] <mattfield> if you had some markup to go along with this it would help
[09:02:52] <NoiseEee> shmup: honestly, create a fiddle

[09:04:21] <G3ron1mo> Hi is there a way to force jquery event to be bound to element, that is being repeatedly destroyed and created. It is $('#parent selectbox').change() where the innerhtml of #parent is changing
[09:04:44] <stevenhong> i guest the answer is Helloworld\\\n2012
[09:04:45] <G3ron1mo> but always there is selectbox
[09:05:03] <stevenhong> I use the ?!, it should not be matched.

[09:05:17] <faraway> stevenhong: not look behind
[09:06:23] <faraway> stevenhong: so it does not make much sens there cause there is no element before

[09:12:00] <G3ron1mo> NoiseEee perfect! Thank you very much.
[09:12:20] <mattfield> rabbi1: and you're trying to target...?
[09:12:38] <rabbi1> mattfield: class name .checkValid of p tag in tab-2
[09:12:56] <stevenhong> maybe i make mistaken.
[09:13:29] <mattfield> rabbi1: ok, so $('#tab-2 p.checkValid');
[09:13:50] <rabbi1> mattfield: yes, but tab2 is not static
[09:14:03] <mattfield> so? it still exists in the DOM
[09:14:27] <mattfield> you can still target it
[09:14:59] <rabbi1> mattfield: sorry, not p.checkValid could be any element a input tags - text, checkbox, radio could be anything
[09:15:41] <mattfield> rabbi1: same thing applies. if it exists in the DOM, you can target it in the same way $('#tab-2' + element);
[09:16:52] <rabbi1> mattfield: no sir.... tab variable is passed with the tab object
[09:16:58] <stevenhong> see here: http://jsfiddle.net/stevenhong/ebYy6/
[09:17:19] <stevenhong> i get your mind now.
[09:17:24] <rabbi1> var something = $(tab + ' element'); doesn't work
[09:17:53] <stevenhong> to troll-boy, the command to send message to you is ?
[09:17:59] <CodesStuff1> rabbi, got a fiddle?
[09:18:11] <mattfield> http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/TTTLw/138/
[09:18:43] <mattfield> you can target anything you want in the second tab just fine. I don't know if I really understand what the problem is, rabbi1;
[09:19:15] <stevenhong> if first match the (?!..), the regxp lookbefore
[09:20:22] <rabbi1> mattfield: i would want to see the content of variable 'something' as [div#tabname .checkValid] that's it. ...
[09:20:22] <CodesStuff1> so rabbi1, whats the problem?
[09:20:29] <CodesStuff1> the 3rd tab not being defined?
[09:22:29] <rabbi1> CodesStuff1: i am assigning the previous tab to a variable called checktab, and then passing it to function validateTab(); under validateTab i am trying to target all elements with class name .checkValid of that particular tab with which the tab object is passed as argument ....
[09:23:47] <CodesStuff1> lol just be ghetto and toss the last tab index in window.lastTab
[09:23:48] <CodesStuff1> :P
[09:24:46] <CodesStuff1> whats happening with the fiddle I'm looking at is the variable tab isn't defined in the scope of that anonymous function
[09:25:15] <CodesStuff1> then again I'm not familiar with jquery ui, so it could be there.

[09:27:32] <some_dude> what's the best way to center footer using jquery? I want it to be absolutely positioned at the bottom of the screen. ALWAYS. thanks
[09:28:01] <Whirl3d> some_dude, use fixed position to keep it always at the bottom
[09:28:43] <some_dude> fixed?
[09:28:44] <CodesStuff1> honestly I always just margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; and width:herpderp
[09:28:48] <Whirl3d> then wrap the footer in a div that you position absollutely with display:inline-block, left:0, right:0, margin:auto and it should work
[09:29:23] <Whirl3d> fixed ensures that it stays at the bottom of the window

[09:47:42] <dogarrhea2> anyone can just view source and access your private members
[09:47:46] <some_dude> codespectator, wat?
[09:47:56] <dogarrhea2> seems not to be private at all
[09:48:22] <CodesStuff1> CodesStuff*, it doesn't go down that far. Are you trying to append a fixed/floating div to the bottom?
[09:48:31] <dogarrhea2> even if you wrap in some closure, anyone can still see it. doesn't seem like "private" members are really a construct in javascript at all
[09:48:58] <shoky> dogarrhea2: how can you access local variables in a function from outside?
[09:49:21] <dogarrhea2> look at the source
[09:49:25] <shoky> anyone can just view your source in java or C++ too, so what?
[09:49:33] <dogarrhea2> reallY?
[09:49:33] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, I'm trying to put footer on the bottom of the page, where it should be , righgteous by god , jesus christ and mary the holy fucking virgin ! A:SDOASD
[09:49:43] <shoky> private means that other CODE can't access it
[09:49:44] <dogarrhea2> shoky: anyone can look at compiled source?
[09:49:56] <shoky> that has nothing to do with the notion of private members :\
[09:49:58] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea2: there's "private" in terms of OOP, and "private" in terms of things you don't want other people to see. entirely different concepts.
[09:50:02] <some_dude> srsly I hate css... programming NP but throw some css and Im done.
[09:50:22] <some_dude> tap out, css > me
[09:50:37] <shoky> dogarrhea2: also, compiled source is still source
[09:50:41] <shoky> nothing private about it
[09:50:44] <Brodingo_> naw some_dude you can do it
[09:50:55] <Brodingo_> i believe in you
[09:51:01] <dogarrhea2> seems you can just look at javascript easier, abuse .prototype = and access  the variables
[09:51:08] <CodesStuff1> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/a4sGt/17/
[09:51:13] <CodesStuff1> just set those attributes with JS
[09:51:21] <some_dude> Brodingo, I've been trying to get a stupid footer at the boottom of my moffugin page for like an hour now. seriously.
[09:51:24] <shoky> dogarrhea2: javascript does nothing to enforce private data members, yes.
[09:51:50] <djsounds02> http://benjisounds.co.uk/examples/Example6/   Why does this slider not work when I load newer libraries?
[09:52:04] <shoky> dogarrhea2: in java i can also, through reflection, change the "source" of some class's method
[09:52:06] <shoky> it's the same thing
[09:52:13] <shoky> nothing is ever private in the sense that you are speaking of
[09:52:19] <shoky> unless it's somewhere remote, inaccessible.
[09:52:28] <NoiseEee> or your feelings
[09:52:33] <dogarrhea2> using reflection vs .prototype are kind of on different levels
[09:52:38] <shoky> no they are not
[09:52:51] <shoky> and even if they are.. so what
[09:53:42] <CodesStuff1> some_dude, did the fiddle edit I posted help you at all?
[09:53:50] <CodesStuff1> Or are you trying to do it with strictly jquery?
[09:54:24] <djsounds02> Anybody know?
[09:54:59] <some_dude> codelahoma, THANKS MAN . I have no freaking clue why your solution works and my doesn't but thanks
[09:55:14] <some_dude> CodesStuff1,  THANKS MAN . I have no freaking clue why your solution works and my doesn't but thanks
[09:55:21] <CodesStuff1> lol
[09:55:33] <Brodingo_> some_dude bottom:0 is pretty key
[09:55:41] <Brodingo_> it… tell it to go to the bottom
[09:55:44] <some_dude> Brodingo, I have thta
[09:55:49] <Brodingo_> you really dont
[09:56:12] <djsounds02> desperate for some help
[09:56:32] <some_dude> Brodingo, oh right my bad
[09:56:38] <dogarrhea2> so all of oo (at least the implementations) are broken/
[09:56:51] <shoky> ..
[09:56:58] <dogarrhea2> it's only an ivory tower where practical limitations override the theory of the paradigm
[09:57:19] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea2: bang on, thanks for coming out
[09:57:23] <djsounds02> Please
[09:57:31] <dogarrhea2> if you can't and are nott supposed to access it, but are still able to somehow throug some hack, what's the point
[09:57:42] <shoky> "i can view the source so it's not OO"  that is absurd
[09:57:46] <CodesStuff1> some_dude: here, http://jsfiddle.net/a4sGt/21/
[09:57:56] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, right, I forgot the width 100% damn... it's always some damnt thing with css
[09:57:56] <CodesStuff1> since you've got a boner for doing it with jquery
[09:58:01] <snover> this is some fantastic stuff guys, keep it up
[09:58:20] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: your question doesn't make much sense.
[09:58:37] <CodesStuff1> oh the fiddle got borked. synaxfail
[09:59:42] <dogarrhea2> Douglas's "parasitic pattern" sounds strangely familiar to factory methods
[10:00:50] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: I dont know how else I could explain it.. the slider fails to work after I load the newer libraries it works with 1.3.2 and ui 1.5.3 http://benjisounds.co.uk/examples/Example6/
[10:01:13] <lz> can anyone recommend a lightweight alternative to jquery?
[10:01:19] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, you're missing a lot of ' , I sugest using object argument instead, but it's just css anyways. had you written it with .position() I'd be impressed :)
[10:01:20] <CodesStuff1> lz: Javascript.
[10:01:25] <lz> I've heard about zepto and ender
[10:01:26] <dogarrhea2> ^
[10:01:30] <CodesStuff1> some_dude, I ctrl + h'd in notepad++
[10:01:39] <CodesStuff1> I b0rked it :D
[10:01:43] <some_dude> hehe
[10:01:52] <lz> CodesStuff1 :)
[10:02:12] <CodesStuff1> Critique time. Do I keep the transform property or toss it out the window? http://oi47.tinypic.com/2pqu91t.jpg
[10:02:27] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: lets see a version with the old libs
[10:02:34] <djsounds02> nps
[10:02:42] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: sometimes code needs to change when you do a lib upgrade
[10:03:09] <djsounds02> http://benjisounds.co.uk/examples/Example7/
[10:03:31] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, ok got another one for you
[10:03:41] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, let me just make a fiddle
[10:03:51] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: i guess stick with the old libs, otherwise try #jqueryui or something
[10:03:52] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: http://benjisounds.co.uk/examples/Example7/ Oh, I thought it would be compatible with a newer library I could understand it not working with an older library
[10:04:34] * CodesStuff1 /nicks from CodesStuff to DebugsStuff
[10:07:42] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/QvfJk/ go get it tiger :)
[10:08:18] <bwen> how can I check if a selector has a specific event bound to it in jquery?
[10:10:11] <NoiseEee> bwen: no can do.... you can perhaps look in Chrome's dev console, highlight an element and check the listeners tab
[10:10:32] <LSshock> hi everyone i'm trying to make a simplistic form validator but failing
[10:10:33] <some_dude> bwen, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515069/jquery-check-if-event-exists-on-element
[10:11:05] <LSshock> i have the main function in it, i have 3 each() that check each type of form element, and if its empty adds a red arrow behind the field
[10:11:28] <LSshock> this works 100% but i cant figure out how to code that if all 3 each are done, and there was no error then assume the form is fine and submit
[10:11:52] <some_dude> LSshock, jsfiddle.net make one , show us
[10:12:04] <LSshock> yes almost got that
[10:12:13] <pppaul> hey jquery people
[10:12:18] <LSshock> i jumped the gun when i tried to do shift+enter to write the whole store :/
[10:12:27] <pppaul> i need to add some fields to a request payload that i'm making
[10:12:35] <pppaul> how do i do that? (uploading a file)
[10:14:19] <CodesStuff1> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/QvfJk/1/
[10:14:22] <CodesStuff1> ghetto time
[10:14:23] <CodesStuff1> lol
[10:14:32] <gvo> pppaul: Maybe http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-file-uploads/#.UBwG08KPXLU
[10:14:42] <CodesStuff1> you'll probably wanna update it on the window resize event
[10:16:01] <CodesStuff1> so this, somedude: http://jsfiddle.net/QvfJk/2/
[10:16:21] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, close but no cigar. the content pink one is going over footer.
[10:16:31] <CodesStuff1> its under it brah
[10:16:41] <CodesStuff1> notice how you can select the text?
[10:16:52] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, it's pink, footer shouldn't be pink
[10:17:28] <CodesStuff1> i set the background color the #content
[10:17:30] <CodesStuff1> to pink
[10:17:34] <CodesStuff1> to show the difference
[10:17:54] <CodesStuff1> when you have 100% width/height, borders cause scrollbars
[10:17:54] <clauwn> can you guys help me with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/cTp87/13/
[10:17:57] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, also when using alot of arguments it's better to use .css({ 'thing':'value', 'thing2':'value2'}) its more readable that way
[10:18:02] <LSshock> ok so hope someone remembers my problem http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/KTRRr/3/ (the validation works as far as seeing if the fields are empty, i cant figure out how to code the part that submits the form after ALL forms have been checked)
[10:18:53] <CodesStuff1> some_dude: fuck bitches, make money. #swag
[10:19:03] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, werd
[10:19:27] <LSshock> CodesStuff1: beastiality yuk
[10:19:39] <clauwn> all i want to do is create a simple dropdown navigation/menu. can you help me on this? http://jsfiddle.net/cTp87/13/
[10:20:00] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, ye that's the thing, the content should stretch up to the footer, but never over it. that's the tricky part. so content+footer should alwys be 100% of the upper div
[10:20:34] <CodesStuff1> er, so set the height to window.height - footer.style.top...
[10:20:36] <CodesStuff1> lolmath
[10:20:52] <CodesStuff1> idk, im tired and have a headache.
[10:21:20] <CodesStuff1> also clauwn: your selector looks fine. what's the problem?
[10:21:25] <some_dude> CodesStuff1, right :)
[10:21:53] <docktorx> can someone please explain bizarre behaviour of the .index() method?
[10:22:18] <docktorx> it seems that it only works the first time I use it
[10:22:33] <clauwn> CodesStuff1: question is about further going into it. how would i select a ul inside the li that has #2 in it?
[10:22:43] <CodesStuff1> parentNode?
[10:23:05] <CodesStuff1> er, .parent([selector])
[10:23:19] <CodesStuff1> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[10:23:21] <tanepiper> Anyone here using flot?
[10:23:24] <docktorx> jsfiddle.com/RKuDg
[10:23:29] <CodesStuff1> The example here is almost exactly what you want, clauwn
[10:23:55] <CodesStuff1> So just pass in the selector you used for the addclass call, and you should be golden
[10:23:57] <docktorx> jsfiddle.net/RKuDg rather
[10:24:54] <gkatsev> does jquery's css handle vendor prefixes?
[10:24:56] <some_dude> LSshock, just use the validator plugin
[10:25:41] <LSshock> i couldnt wrap my head around that, well not on how i could get my error icon to show up
[10:25:48] <clauwn> CodesStuff1: nice, thanks ^^
[10:26:05] <sunbeam> Did anyone in here ever added facebook wall links on some site or blog? It's a public facebook profile where I need to get these from
[10:26:38] <tw2113> i tend to use the facebook provided stuff for that sunbeam
[10:26:51] <tw2113> when possible
[10:26:54] <CodesStuff1> Yeah.. Do you own the account you're pulling the data from?
[10:27:27] <tw2113> i wish they'd provide a json feed, but that's too generous for FB
[10:27:50] <CodesStuff1> They do... you just need to be authenticated with oAuth
[10:27:51] <CodesStuff1> lol
[10:29:53] <some_dude> LSshock, http://corpocrat.com/2009/07/15/quick-easy-form-validation-tutorial-with-jquery/ read this. as for the icon check this http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/milk/
[10:29:55] <CodesStuff1> sunbeam: If you want to pull it from a page.. http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=112140545537576&format=json
[10:30:18] <bwen> is it possible to add a function to an element (selector) without having it on all elements (not with $.fn). But something like $('.someClass').myFunction = function () {} and then have it available whenever I select it with another selector $('div section .someClass').myFunction();
[10:30:25] <LSshock> thanks some_dude
[10:30:32] <some_dude> LSshock, npz
[10:32:19] <shoky> bwen: no, use .data() for that
[10:37:01] <sunbeam> CodesStuff1: its that simple?
[10:38:32] <CodesStuff1> sunbeam: if you're pulling it from a fanpage, then yes
[10:38:47] <CodesStuff1> just dump in the fanpage ID if yours
[10:39:04] <sunbeam> ok i got it
[10:39:05] <sunbeam> thanks
[10:39:07] <CodesStuff1> select the data type for the return (json, rss, rss2), and you're good to go
[10:39:10] <CodesStuff1> np
[10:39:59] <tw2113> good point, i think i did sort of know facebook had json
[10:40:00] <sunbeam> CodesStuff1: i only need the title and alternate i thikn , right?
[10:40:20] <tw2113> we don't know what you need
[10:40:38] <sunbeam> i need the link
[10:40:42] <sunbeam> to that wall post
[10:40:54] <sunbeam> but i only see the photo.php thing in the json array
[10:41:57] <tw2113> you could probably construct the url with the ID
[10:42:32] <tw2113> for example one of my posts https://www.facebook.com/tw2113/posts/569942629716 <----string of numbers = the id
[10:44:13] <sunbeam> ok sec
[10:45:04] <sunbeam> the id looks like a hash
[10:45:30] <COLONEL_PANIC> HI ALL
[10:46:53] <sunbeam> nvm
[10:47:00] <sunbeam> the alternate variable is good
[10:48:26] <tw2113> go you then ;)
[10:50:22] <sunbeam> what would be the good way to parse it?
[10:50:46] <tw2113> jQuery
[10:50:50] <sunbeam> var obj = "http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=112140545537576&format=json"
[10:51:03] <sunbeam> obj = jQuery.parseJSON(obj);
[10:51:06] <tw2113> getJSON or ajax()
[10:51:06] <sunbeam> and then foreach?
[10:51:09] <sunbeam> ok
[10:51:15] <tw2113> $.each()
[10:55:01] <granden> Dunno if this is the correct channel, but what the heck. If I wanna cache a few images, could I use jquery for that some way? Would adding all pictures to my site and then do, hide() load the images but not show them on my site?
[10:58:20] <AMcP> It would load them all
[10:58:33] <AMcP> It is not advised if they're of any consequential size
[10:59:04] <AMcP> As your initial page load would be really slow. If they're things like gradients for UI elements that you don't want to wait for on a hover event or something, definitely load them up
[10:59:07] <granden> AMcP: But I dont want them to be shown, so how to hide them?
[10:59:10] <AMcP> Or better yet, sprite them out
[10:59:35] <granden> its like, 46 images of 4-8kB
[11:00:07] <granden> at least under 400kB's in total.
[11:00:32] <NoiseEee> granden: the ideal thing would be lazy loading really.... load as needed.
[11:01:07] <granden> but it takes to long when needing to load them all.
[11:01:09] <granden> Its like this
[11:01:25] <granden> I got a first page, that shows 4 of 50 pictures. And on the next page it should show all 50 pictures at once.
[11:01:31] <granden> And you should pick the 4 pictures from the first page.
[11:01:44] <granden> Now on a slow connection it loads the 4 pictures from start page instantly
[11:12:34] <dogarrhea2> hrm. these weight lifting competitions seem like they favor shorter people.
[11:13:00] <dogarrhea2> if you go by the work = force x distance formula, short people don't have to do as much work to get it over their heads into the air
[11:19:23] <LSshock> im getting really close with my own validator http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/KTRRr/9/ but when it hits 0 it does not run the if(){} i got on the button and in the function. I have been on this for hours, maybe i'm crossed eyed
[11:20:16] <jedimind> LSshock, you might want to take a look at...
[11:20:22] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/
[11:20:47] <jedimind> its basically the same principle as yours, only more reusable and not so repetitive
[11:20:55] <jedimind> take a look at the .js file for some pointers on methodology
[11:21:16] <LSshock> thanks
[11:22:26] <NoiseEee> LSshock: if($count===0) not if($count=0)
[11:24:54] <LSshock> NoiseEee: thanks never knew that, i had it with == but that was incorrect so i didnt know it was ===
[11:31:51] <Cache_Money> forewarning: I'm a noob.  I have an input text field, when the user clicks the sumbit button I'd like to take that text and add it to a div above the input text box.  http://pastie.org/4385260
[11:33:16] <Cache_Money> I'd like the guess to go into a <p> tag within the specified <div>
[11:33:16] <MINTTU> what can i do to optimize this code? http://jsfiddle.net/JDju7/
[11:33:19] <granden> My script stops executing at this line, any idea why?
[11:33:20] <granden>  $('#cd').css('color',$colors[$run]);
[11:33:36] <granden> var colors=new Array("#25a748","#ed6c7e","#ed6c7e","#ed6c7e","#000000");
[11:33:40] <granden> that is my colors array.
[11:34:07] <granden> it runs one time when $run = 5.
[11:34:22] <Cache_Money> I can get it to show up for an instant and then it disappears... unsure why that's happening :/
[11:34:24] <granden> run = 4
[11:34:51] <cshepp> Cache_Money: $('#guess').value;
[11:35:37] <Cache_Money> cshepp:  it still only shows up for a split second and then disappears
[11:36:29] <Cache_Money> cshepp: I've tried $('#history').append(responses); with the same result
[11:40:52] <ragas> Im adjusting the height of some from divs, based on the height of the content div: $(document).ready(function() {  var height = parseInt($('#page').css('height'))+ parseInt($('#primary').css('height')) -32  + "px";  }); // returns an incorrect value when the page is reloaded, otherwise OK
[11:41:07] <Cache_Money> * $('#history').append(guess);
[11:41:37] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/cQbJm2LA i cant figure this out for the life of me... when i var_dump the post content of username here i get bool(false) instead of what i typed in...
[11:44:20] <NoiseEee> anew_: 'username' isn't being POSTed.
[11:44:59] <anew_> lol
[11:45:00] <anew_> so bad
[11:45:04] <anew_> thanks oiseEee
[11:45:11] <NoiseEee> np
[11:45:11] <anew_> * NoiseEee
[11:45:20] <sunbeam> when i have a link, that returns json like http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=112140545537576&format=json, and this returns a json object. how can I get it in an object on my page?
[11:49:38] <MINTTU> what can i do to optimize this code? http://jsfiddle.net/JDju7/
[11:50:18] <MINTTU> sunbeam: you know any serverside code?
[11:50:23] <MINTTU> lang
[11:50:27] <MINTTU> asp, php
[11:51:07] <tw2113> how lovely, the fb json has invalid label errors
[11:51:22] <sunbeam> tw2113: how do you mean
[11:51:49] <sunbeam> MINTTU: ##php
[11:51:58] <tw2113> $.getJSON('https://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=112140545537576&format=json&jsoncallback=?', function(data){
[11:51:58] <tw2113>   console.log(data);
[11:51:58] <tw2113> });
[11:52:05] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: what is your err array doing?  why are you specify keys ?
[11:52:08] <MINTTU> haha i answered your question
[11:52:17] <MINTTU> sunbeam
[11:52:20] <MINTTU> not asked one.
[11:52:37] <MINTTU> in php you could use file_get_contents for the url
[11:52:52] <MINTTU> and json_decode() to handle the json
[11:53:20] <MINTTU> NoiseEee: to handle a form
[11:53:41] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: but what is "err"?  why are you specifying keys?
[11:53:43] <sunbeam> yes, but i'm using this json object in js, not in php/asp
[11:53:52] <sunbeam> thanks tw2113
[11:53:59] <MINTTU> if the array only contain "false" elements then the submit button activates
[11:54:05] <MINTTU> or it should.
[11:54:35] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: i don't see why an array is needed at all, and you rarely should be setting arrays with specific key values
[11:54:55] <MINTTU> So what you suggest?
[11:54:59] <tw2113> hmm
[11:55:11] <diamonds> is there a way to run a function after $().each has completed?
[11:55:13] <NoiseEee> MINTTU: not re-inventing the wheel, maybe check out http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/ which was posted before
[11:55:19] <diamonds> runonce each callback?
[11:55:56] <ch3mical> diamonds, deferred?
[11:56:04] <diamonds> yeah I was wondering about that
[11:56:40] <diamonds> I don't really understand how to use deferreds thos
[11:57:50] <ch3mical> diamonds, try http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/
[11:57:58] <diamonds> thanks
[11:59:13] <samuel02> can anyone give input on this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11801711/shown-event-doesnt-fire-in-ie9-using-twitter-bootstrap-modal-in-rails
[12:00:03] <Whirl3d> so I guess I need to learn about media queries....should I ask in CSS or does anyone have a nice link for me?

[12:04:28] <sunbeam> where should console.log appear again? i dont see it in Console -> All
[12:05:32] <ezio> chrome?
[12:06:10] <ezio> as long as you're in the chrome debug area, press esc to toggle the console
[12:06:12] <ezio> sunbeam,
[12:07:02] <sunbeam> firefox firebug
[12:07:49] <ezio> ew
[12:07:50] <ezio> k
[12:07:54] <ezio> there's a little drop down box
[12:08:09] <ezio> six icons from the left
[12:08:14] <ezio> top left of firebug
[12:08:23] <sunbeam> yes
[12:08:30] <ezio> drop it down and click console
[12:08:40] <sunbeam> yes thats ticked already
[12:08:49] <ezio> and you don't have a console tab?
[12:09:12] <ezio> or you donj't have an immediate window
[12:09:23] <ezio> the immediate window is bottom right red button
[12:09:30] <ezio> i think it's red but i'm colorblind
[12:09:42] <sunbeam> i do have the console tab
[12:09:45] <sunbeam> i just dont see the log
[12:10:01] <ezio> you have all selected?
[12:10:02] <sunbeam> of this
[12:10:03] <sunbeam> yes
[12:10:26] <ezio> in your immediate window type 1 enter
[12:10:38] <ezio> or 1 then run
[12:11:41] <Attmattic> return calEvent.title + "\n" + calEvent.body; <----- What Am I doing wrong here it keeps showing up on the same line I want seperate..
[12:11:52] <ezio> \r\n
[12:11:59] <sunbeam> ezio: "The profiler is running"
[12:12:00] <sunbeam> this?
[12:12:20] <ezio> click console
[12:12:29] <ezio> lower right hand corner there's a button with a carat
[12:12:33] <ezio> ^ or v
[12:12:45] <ezio> then you'll see run clear copy history
[12:12:50] <sunbeam> ezio: nvm i think i made a syntax mistake sorry
[12:13:07] <Attmattic> ezio \r\n didnt work im working with jquery weekcalendar..
[12:13:12] <tw2113> if console.log isn't showing anything when you think it should, then you have no data to log
[12:13:34] <ezio> Attmattic, that's not the way you do it in html
[12:13:58] <Attmattic> ok so what I am I doing wrong?
[12:14:07] <sunbeam> tw2113: yes, you're right
[12:14:19] <ezio> Attmattic, return "<div>" + calEvent.title + "</div><div>" + calEvent.body;
[12:14:26] <sunbeam> tw2113:  i thikn something is wrong with jsoncallback=?',
[12:14:29] <ezio> Attmattic, return "<div>" + calEvent.title + "</div><div>" + calEvent.body + "</div>"
[12:14:29] <sunbeam> i get an error about that
[12:14:46] <tw2113> then take that parameter off
[12:14:58] <Grundell> can i wrapp a h3 and a p in a div with help of js ?
[12:15:13] <ezio> Grundell, impossible
[12:15:17] <sunbeam> tw2113: i did, but then it doesn't return anytihng (while when i open that link in a browser it returns a json array
[12:15:22] <Grundell> ezio. okay
[12:15:37] <ezio> Grundell, $('<h3>').wrap('div')
[12:15:39] <ezio> i think
[12:15:39] <Attmattic> ah ok its expecting html
[12:15:41] <cassel> hello..
[12:15:51] <ezio> Attmattic, not to be mean ... duh
[12:15:53] <Attmattic> thanks ezio!
[12:15:59] <ezio> Attmattic, lol later
[12:16:00] <Grundell> oo thats nice :)
[12:16:05] <Attmattic> thanks bud!!
[12:16:09] <ezio> np
[12:16:29] <sunbeam> tw2113: just wondering, whys this jsoncallback= needed
[12:17:08] <cassel> I need a help with jquery. I have a table with results and each line of this result has one id and after the result I would like to be able to get this id when I click on it to send to a submit to make another search with php and bring the result in bellow that line of the table.
[12:17:10] <tw2113> not sure exactly, but i've had cases where not including it made stuff not work
[12:17:21] <cassel> how do I get this ID with jquery?
[12:17:26] <sunbeam> tw2113: I get "SyntaxError: invalid label"
[12:17:38] <tw2113> yeah, i'm blaming the json data on that one
[12:18:22] <sunbeam> hm
[12:18:29] <sunbeam> so fb returns not proper json data?
[12:19:13] <tw2113> that's my best guess at the moment
[12:19:19] <tw2113> for some reason it's having label issues
[12:19:23] <Grundell> okay so realized that my question was really badly formed. I have <div> <h3><p></p></h3> <h3><p></p></h3> i want to seperate them so that i wrapp each of the withi in a div so it looks like: <div> <div><h3><p></p></h3></div> <div><h3><p></p></h3></div> </div>
[12:19:41] <Grundell> is that possible?
[12:19:49] <cassel> anyone could help me out?
[12:19:49] <p3rtutt1> I've just developed a small web application, here's the link, I hope its good for someone, suggestions are welcome :) => http://hash.makemilk.net/
[12:20:40] <ezio> Grundell, $('#div_id h3, #div_id p').wrap('div')
[12:21:41] <Grundell> sweet
[12:22:15] <cassel> I need a help with jquery. I have a table with results and each line of this result has one id and after the result I would like to be able to get this id when I click on it to send to a submit to make another search with php and bring the result in bellow that line of the table.
[12:22:37] <sunbeam> tw2113: hmm ok, any other alternative i can use?
[12:23:09] <Grundell> It didn't want to work
[12:23:19] <Grundell> Is that because i have class on it ?
[12:23:31] <tw2113> i dunno
[12:23:40] <pachet> MINTTU: i know it was a couple of minutes ago, but i cleaned up your code for you: jsfiddle.net/McJfs/
[12:24:04] <pifantastic> Grundell: can you please recreate the problem using jsfiddle or jsbin?
[12:24:11] <pachet> MINTTU: you should listen to NoiseEee though, reinventing the wheel is poopy
[12:24:49] <Grundell> pifantastic, can se if im able to
[12:25:32] <pifantastic> Grundell: I'll get you started: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/H3BEB/
[12:25:36] <cassel> anyone could help me out  I am new on it :(
[12:25:46] <Grundell> haha how nice
[12:25:59] <pifantastic> cassel: jsfiddle or jsbin please
[12:26:57] <pifantastic> Grundell: here is it working in a more obvious way: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/H3BEB/1/
[12:27:12] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/H3BEB/2/ here is what i have in code
[12:27:50] <pifantastic> Grundell: hmm, that will be a little harder
[12:27:50] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/H3BEB/3/ that
[12:28:02] <Grundell> that is what i want to achive
[12:28:14] <Grundell> (indented divs in that one )
[12:28:34] <Grundell> Is taht even possible ?
[12:28:53] <sunbeam> tw2113: It seems the data needs to be returned as dataType: "jsonp"
[12:28:59] <sunbeam> tw2113: thanks for helping, i guess this works
[12:29:25] <sunbeam> (because the url is being returned as text/javascript
[12:30:06] <ezio> Grundell, no
[12:30:15] <ezio> Grundell, don't call it .div_summary
[12:30:17] <ezio> just .summary
[12:30:18] <tw2113> welcome to api/data processing
[12:30:34] <tw2113> it's fun once you get the caveats figured out
[12:31:02] <Grundell> ezio now i've gor an endless loop instead :P
[12:33:05] <ezio> Grundell, i was hoping that you would look up the wrap command ... i was just pointing it out to you
[12:33:10] <ezio> you're close
[12:33:17] <ezio> go read the wrap documentation
[12:33:22] <ezio> you'll see what's wrong right away
[12:34:18] <Grundell> okay
[12:34:47] <JeffreyLevesque> how do you make something appear only if you scroll down?
[12:35:21] <Grundell> okay so i missed the <>
[12:35:31] <pifantastic> Grundell: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/DVu6T/4/
[12:35:35] <ezio> JeffreyLevesque, http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/load-content-while-scrolling-with-jquery/
[12:35:35] <pifantastic> it's ugly, but does what you want
[12:35:38] <Grundell> Now i have all of them wrapped individually
[12:35:41] <pifantastic> there is probably a better solution
[12:36:14] <Grundell> Ahh that's cool :)
[12:36:21] <Grundell> Thanks :)
[12:36:33] <ezio> oh my god ... seriously? Grundell  pifantastic  ...
[12:36:53] <Grundell> ezio - sorry im really new to jQuery...
[12:37:02] <pifantastic> ezio: I told you it was ugly
[12:37:21] <pifantastic> ezio: wrap doesn't work since he wants to wrap 2 adjacent elements
[12:37:33] <JeffreyLevesque> ezio: i was thinking of getting window height: $(window).height(); and total height: $(window).scrollTop();
[12:37:33] <Grundell> ezio - i just think it's cool that it actually works. or is there a way to continue what you we're doing ?
[12:38:30] <shmup> can i refer to a json value with a variable, like var foo = "Red"; var bar = someJson.foo;
[12:38:46] <shmup> because it's not liking if the variable is the key, and if i hardtype someJson.Red, it works
[12:38:50] <shmup> so i'm assuming i have to do something else :P
[12:39:00] <johnkpaul> shmup: someJson[foo]
[12:39:16] <ezio> Grundell, k i see you need both wrapped
[12:39:22] <Grundell> yes
[12:39:51] <Jon471> shmup: you would need to assign it like so: someJson[foo]
[12:39:53] <ezio> you could just
[12:40:00] <shmup> sorry john i asked that wrong. i'll be exact, offers[index].TagLine is what i want to access, but i want TagLine to be a the value of a variable
[12:40:08] <shmup> So offers[index].foo
[12:40:13] <shmup> above would be var foo = "TagLine"
[12:40:40] <shmup> or can i go offers[index][foo], k sec thats prolly it heh
[12:41:08] <Grundell> ezio - (qickly going to run to the toilet brb)
[12:41:08] <ezio> nm
[12:42:22] <johnkpaul> shmup: yes, that
[12:42:25] <johnkpaul> s probably it
[12:42:33] <shmup> yep it was, thanks johnkpaul
[12:42:41] <johnkpaul> no problem, shmup, have fun!
[12:42:47] <pifantastic> it's fun watching shmup answer his own question
[12:42:56] <shmup> well 1.3 hours left till work's over, then i can go play FNM
[12:42:58] <shmup> THEN FUN happens
[12:43:07] <raymondcamden> FNM?
[12:43:11] <shmup> friday night magic
[12:43:15] <shmup> mtg shit~
[12:43:28] <ezio> JeffreyLevesque, document height window height, scroll top, once scrolltop + doc height > window height - 50, loadmore(*)
[12:43:31] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:43:39] <ezio> JeffreyLevesque, -*
[12:43:56] <JeffreyLevesque> thanks
[12:43:56] <johnkpaul> pifantastic: those are the best kinds of questions, the ones you just have to type out to know the answer to
[12:44:03] <JeffreyLevesque> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898130/how-to-check-if-a-user-has-scrolled-to-the-bottom
[12:44:25] <ezio> couldn't be more simple
[12:44:31] <pifantastic> johnkpaul: which is why I wish more people would just screw around in the console before asking their question
[12:44:39] <pifantastic> I think they would end up solving it most of the time
[12:44:56] <ezio> make sure load more sets $('#load_spinner').show()
[12:44:57] <johnkpaul> yeah, in general people aren't a fan of that sadly
[12:45:12] <johnkpaul> although that's more likely going to help when it's a js question than a jquery question
[12:45:39] <pachet> jquery questions are js questions deep down :]
[12:45:48] <shmup> not even deep down
[12:46:11] <pachet> well, maybe deep down from the perspective of most askers
[12:46:32] <johnkpaul> depends on how much expectation you have that people can easily read the source
[12:49:46] <ezio> JeffreyLevesque, i was close.  you want the second answer inside the first answer
[12:49:47] <ezio> if($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() > $(document).height() - 100)
[12:49:49] <zeroXten> anyone know of any free content sliders that have a vertically stacked options on the right, with content on the left? Also, little markers/arrows to indicate the relationship between selected option and content.
[12:50:31] <ezio> zeroXten, do you mind spending 20 bucks?
[12:50:56] <zeroXten> perhaps, what do you suggest ezio ?
[12:50:57] <shmup> pifantastic: haha
[12:51:02] <ezio> http://tzd-themes.com
[12:51:18] <shmup> i've heard on multiple occasions that my friend said to feel free to IM him so i could answer my own questions after a few minutes
[12:51:19] <zeroXten> http://www.slidorion.com/ seems pretty cool
[12:51:28] <zeroXten> ezio: will take a look at your suggestion
[12:51:33] <shmup> i was told on multiple occasions by my friend***
[12:51:34] <ezio> zeroXten, it's an awesome site ... i don't even design pages anymore ... just program them
[12:52:20] <ezio> zero ooops
[12:52:26] <ezio> zeroXten, wrong site
[12:52:48] <ezio> zeroXten, themeforest.net
[12:53:19] <zeroXten> ezio: templates?
[12:53:31] <ezio> zeroXten, 90% of them are done in jquery and bootstrap
[12:53:38] <ezio> people design beautiful sliders
[12:53:42] <ezio> and widgets
[12:53:44] <ezio> and shit
[12:53:49] <ezio> we just bought gebo admin
[12:53:53] <sunbeam> hmm even with thats the same tw2113
[12:54:02] <zeroXten> ah ok
[12:54:05] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm having problems retrieving JSON objects from facebook (facebook fan page wall data).. Facebook seems to deliver not properly json objects
[12:54:21] <ezio> $16 bucks to save weeks of programming
[12:54:22] <zeroXten> i think i'll give slidorion a go
[12:54:24] <ezio> fuck yes
[12:54:31] <zeroXten> heh
[12:59:55] <MINTTU> sunbeam, whats the prob then?
[13:00:42] <tw2113> MINTTU invalid "label" errors
[13:02:14] <sunbeam> Yes, AND when i use dataType: "jsonp" I get an access forbidden
[13:04:40] <sunbeam> unbelievable that nobody else encounters this problem
[13:04:56] <sunbeam> I mean, I guess i'm not the only one in the whole world accessing facebook data like this
[13:07:21] <pachet> facewhat?
[13:09:46] <jpcody> hey folks, having an issue with jquery ui sortable where in IE (<=9), dragging a <tr> within a <tbody> causes a snap to the top of the page. i haven't been able to repro in a fiddle or a simplified use case, though I've tried. not sure where else to turn. anyone ever seen an issue like this?
[13:10:26] <Woet> expand your simple use case to the full page element by element
[13:10:31] <Woet> when it breaks again, you know which part to debug
[13:12:44] <jpcody> all right Woet, i'll start that process. just wanted to throw a line out and see if anyone had run into something similar before. google seems to suggest not really :/
[13:21:08] <sunbeam> Is getting facebook json wall data through http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=ID so unusual? I cannot get it to work whatever method I try
[13:38:23] <jgarbers1> If I want to replace the contents of a div with ID "foo" with some other element I've built up in a variable "bar" -- not just a string, but a DOM element -- is $('#foo').html(bar) correct, or is there a different / better way to replace foo's contents?
[13:39:03] <NoiseEee> $('#foo').replace(bar)
[13:39:15] <NoiseEee> sorry http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[13:39:27] <CodesStuff1> http://i.imgur.com/5qe8O.jpg
[13:40:13] <jgarbers1> NoiseEee: I tried that, but replaceWith would replace the "foo" element itself -- not its contents -- with "bar".
[13:40:44] <NoiseEee> is bar an element that you want to append to foo?
[13:41:07] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/append/ jgarbers1
[13:41:07] <jgarbers1> not append. replace. in other words, foo might have some stuff in it; i want to get rid of that and have bar in there instead.
[13:41:19] <NoiseEee> then yes, html()
[13:41:55] <jgarbers1> okay, that's what i thought, but i was concerned that using html() might try to change my bar element into a string and then back again or something, leading to performance problems.
[13:42:10] <jgarbers1> any idea if that happens? or is html() smart enough to say hey, this is already a dom element, i can just stick it in?
[13:42:24] <jgarbers1> (trying to find where html() is implemented in the source and having trouble finding it)
[13:42:54] <NoiseEee> jgarbers1: if its an element, you want to append it to #foo.
[13:43:05] <NoiseEee> jgarbers1: if its content/a string of html, you can use .html()
[13:43:27] <NoiseEee> assuming bar is a <div>,  you would of course $('#foo').append(bar)
[13:43:34] <jgarbers1> so if i want to get rid of foo's old content and replace it with bar, it's a two-step: remove all of foo's current children and then append bar?
[13:44:04] <NoiseEee> jgarbers1: yep, empty() and append()
[13:44:06] <jgarbers1> this seems like a common thing to want to do. i thought sure there'd be a replace() function like you suggested at the beginning. :-)
[13:44:11] <jgarbers1> okay, i'll use those.
[13:44:18] <jgarbers1> thanks very much, NoiseEee!
[13:44:21] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[13:44:32] <funkymonk> anyone use uploadify before?
[13:45:13] <jgarbers1> ah, even a one liner using chaining: $('#foo').empty().append(bar)
[13:45:16] <jgarbers1> nice 'n' easy
[13:45:48] <jgarbers1> as GI Joe used to say, "knowing is half the battle" :-)
[13:49:08] <funkymonk> any other good multi file uploads that will work on IE7
[13:49:17] <funkymonk> plugins
[13:55:47] <darkfrog> I know this is a long shot, but is there any way to determine a unique identifier or something for a tab / window so I can differentiate between pages loaded in different tabs / windows?
[13:56:31] <SlexAxton> just hit alt+f4
[13:56:49] <SlexAxton> but really
[13:56:56] <SlexAxton> unless the page loads at the same time as eachother
[13:57:02] <SlexAxton> you can timestamp the instances
[13:57:13] <SlexAxton> and then cookie that timestamp as a unique identifier
[13:57:25] <SlexAxton> mix the timestamp with a Math.random if you're feeling lucky
[13:58:19] <darkfrog> SlexAxton: well, what I'm attempting is server sessions + window differentiation
[13:58:32] <SlexAxton> you get the same session across windows
[13:58:36] <SlexAxton> so that might not work
[13:58:53] <darkfrog> SlexAxton: I know that....this is why "+ window" is a necessary amendment. :)
[13:59:02] <pifantastic> darkfrog: what SlexAxton said should work, just Math.random() + new Date and save that to localStorage
[13:59:21] <darkfrog> pifantastic: localStorage is shared about tabs / windows
[13:59:35] <pifantastic> darkfrog: derp
[13:59:39] <pifantastic> you're right
[13:59:49] <pifantastic> I guess store it in the DOM
[14:00:00] <darkfrog> pifantastic: that won't carry from one page to another
[14:00:00] <pifantastic> $(document).data(Math.random() + new Date());
[14:00:26] <pifantastic> that's true, so maybe hijack the links, and put it in the URL :D
[14:00:37] <darkfrog> pifantastic: that will work for one page and AJAX calls, but I want tab-based sessions
[14:01:07] <SlexAxton> you don't want it to go across windows, I thought?
[14:01:18] <darkfrog> SlexAxton: right
[14:01:23] <pifantastic> SlexAxton: I think he wants it so stay if they refresh the page
[14:01:26] <pifantastic> or hit a relative URL
[14:01:32] <darkfrog> pifantastic: exactly
[14:01:48] <darkfrog> I fear what I want isn't really possible, but hoping someone might have a clever idea. :)
[14:02:31] <pifantastic> darkfrog: I don't think there is an *official* way, but you might be able to get reallllly clever
[14:02:46] <pifantastic> darkfrog: what are you doing? Maybe a browser extension would be a good solution
[14:02:55] <pifantastic> darkfrog: because they can do things like that much more easily
[14:03:03] <SlexAxton> oh
[14:03:07] <SlexAxton> then just update the hash
[14:03:11] <darkfrog> pifantastic: nah, this is a web framework, so that would be annoying. :o
[14:03:16] <SlexAxton> or use html5 history
[14:03:20] <SlexAxton> and add it to the url
[14:03:26] <pifantastic> SlexAxton: but opening in a new tab
[14:03:30] <pifantastic> would break that
[14:03:31] * darkfrog looks up html5 history...
[14:03:35] <SlexAxton> that's the goal
[14:03:40] <SlexAxton> new tab is a new session
[14:03:47] <pifantastic> SlexAxton: no I mean it would keep the session in that case
[14:03:47] <SlexAxton> but links and reloading in the same window
[14:03:50] <SlexAxton> is the same session
[14:03:59] <pifantastic> when you wouldn't want to
[14:04:04] <SlexAxton> not necessarily
[14:04:06] <pifantastic> but aside from that edge case, yeah, it would work
[14:06:39] <darkfrog> the problem though is that the server would need to know this information before it loads the page, and obviously JavaScript would be an after-effect
[14:07:05] <darkfrog> I could do some multi-pass AJAX calls, but that would be painful
[14:07:28] <darkfrog> why can't browsers just put their page request: windowId as a header. :-p
[14:08:36] <darkfrog> hmmm....what about a cookie
[14:10:21] <darkfrog> it would be a complete violation of the way cookies are supposed to work, but I could set a "tab specific" cookie to send when the page loads, JavaScript would keep the value, and then set the cookie again right before page change (that way if another page loaded in the meantime)
[14:10:32] <darkfrog> although, that could create some serious thread-safety issues
[14:11:15] <darkfrog> though technically the inherent nature of one-machine per actual session means that one person shouldn't be loading content simultaneously in multiple tabs unless they are just taking forever to load
[14:12:18] <darkfrog> Server: Create new session with generated cookie value that lives for the session only and sends in the page response
[14:12:45] <darkfrog> Client: Reads the cookie value into JavaScript then deletes the cookie (so additional sessions will be created if another tab is opened)
[14:12:54] <darkfrog> Client: Sets the cookie value immediately before changing pages
[14:13:05] <darkfrog> scary and horrible yet?
[14:16:52] <briley> hello, anyone up for answering a quick jQuery UI question?
[14:17:04] <shoky> shoooooooooooooooooot
[14:17:16] <briley> aha! a victim.
[14:17:19] <briley> http://jsfiddle.net/xxTzY/1/
[14:17:42] <briley> try dragging the smaller box around
[14:17:53] <briley> in Firefox, if you have it?
[14:18:39] <briley> I'm running into an issue where the element is being resized while dragging, and I'm trying to figure out if it's a bug that I should tell someone about, or if it's something wrong with what I'm doing
[14:19:43] <shoky> it's the -moz-box-sizing
[14:19:52] <shoky> without it it's fine
[14:20:42] <briley> it seems to me like jQuery isn't calculating the width of the element correctly?
[14:20:54] <briley> because of the box-sizing
[14:22:30] <shoky> dont know much about box-sizing and if jqueryui supports it, sorry
[14:22:44] <Salvager> im trying to find out how this options framework i downloaded is working. there is is save button, which is a button tag, and when it press it, it saves. but i cant find any code anywhere that responds to the class of the button. anyone know how it might work?
[14:22:45] <shoky> (but same thing happens on chrome if you use -webkit-box-sizing)
[14:23:38] <briley> cool, thanks shoky. I've done a couple cursory google searches and haven't seen anything related to jQuery, so I guess I'll file a bug in case it's something that needs to be fixed
[14:25:04] <shoky> briley: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11004
[14:26:52] <briley> aah!
[14:27:04] <briley> yep, that looks like the issue
[14:28:03] <shoky> briley: http://jsfiddle.net/xxTzY/5/
[14:30:57] <briley> shoky: what changed?
[14:31:51] <briley> oh, the jQuery version
[14:31:56] <briley> dug
[14:31:58] <briley> duh, rather
[14:34:15] <ogk1000> if I have a nav bg that spans 100% width and then the nav element 990px... is it <section><nav> or <div><nav> or <nav><section> or doesnt matter?
[14:40:18] <funkymonk> any other good multi file uploads plugins that will work on IE7
[14:42:27] <poop> if i have an iframe and inside the iframe i include jquery, and then once jquery is all included i do parent.postMessage($); and then receive the message in the parent and assign the message data to a var called '$', can i use jquery like normal?
[15:02:17] <LSshock> Hi everyone, i'm trying to filter out plain tekst bbcode and so far its going alright but my each() part stops after the first. Wondering if anyone can tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/evtns/55/ thanks!
[15:10:30] <LSshock> wow never seen this channel so quiet
[15:12:47] <AfroTurf> var data = this.data; data.slice(1,3); console.log(this.data); <-- why is this.data is still sliced?
[15:14:18] <carlo> hola
[15:14:24] <carlo> que tal
[15:14:24] <zoned> AfroTurf, try var data2 = this.data;
[15:14:30] <AfroTurf> ok
[15:15:16] <AfroTurf> zoned: same result
[15:17:16] <AfroTurf> is it because javascript is assigning by reference?
[15:22:19] <shoky> AfroTurf: slice doesn't change the original
[15:22:45] <AfroTurf> shonky: that's what i thought but in my code it does
[15:23:03] <shoky> no, it doesn't ;p
[15:23:30] <AfroTurf> 1 sec
[15:29:58] <eip56> Ok its friday
[15:30:01] <eip56> lets make somehting epic
[15:30:08] <eip56> so i dont have to go back to work monday
[15:30:09] * shoky farts
[15:30:16] <eip56> irc brainstorm
[15:30:42] <shoky> quit your job and move to india
[15:31:37] <eip56> lol why india
[15:33:02] <shoky> dunno it's nice and cheap, and you can clean some yogi's feet in an ashram
[15:35:10] <Salvager> can anyone tell me what this does http://pastebin.com/PPWMeqnu ?
[15:38:51] <teewuane> Salvager: it takes the url plus it's hash and sets an input's value to that, then scrolls to the top
[15:40:58] <teewuane> i think the if statement is checking to see if there is a "#" at the end of the current location/url
[15:42:35] <fgk> Wow, huge channel. Great. Anyway, I'm running firefox 13.0.1 on FreeBSD using the linux kernel module, and jquery does not seem to be supported
[15:42:59] <fgk> These do not work on my firefox: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Live_Examples_of_jQuery
[15:43:25] <fgk> and on any given page, including jquery remotely with <script> causes all other scripts to not work
[15:43:59] <fgk> this firefox is originally packaged for Fedora, i think. is there something i'm missing here? why wouldn't it work normally?
[15:44:25] <dabear> Salvager: if a hash exists in the address bar, it will add that hash to the _wp_http_referer input box
[15:44:33] <dabear> while keeping the url as well
[15:45:23] <dabear> fgk: that would be an issue most here have no clue how to solve
[15:45:52] <fgk> I see; this is almost certainly a browser bug though, I'd guess?
[15:45:56] <dabear> go ask your repository maintainers/rpm creaters
[15:46:13] <Salvager> thanks alots, the thing is though. the input is hidden, and the value is allready the url+hash before the snippet is run
[15:46:17] <Salvager> its not my code
[15:46:22] <Salvager> so just trying to understand it
[15:46:23] <fgk> there are no other reports of any firefox versions not working though, correct?
[15:46:23] <dabear> fgk: yes, either that or you scrued up
[15:46:48] <dabear> did you debug it?
[15:46:55] <dabear> is there any errors in the error console?
[15:46:56] <fgk> I'm not sober right now but I'm pretty certain it's not me. Besides, the live examples don't work
[15:46:59] <fgk> no errors
[15:47:22] <fgk> I include jquery.js, and javascript on the page doesn't execute
[15:47:31] <fgk> i might try reading firefox's logs, if i can find them
[15:47:49] <dabear> then you have some pebkacs
[15:48:14] <dabear> (and why are you drunk while coding(crunk?)?)
[15:48:25] <fgk> High
[15:48:32] <fgk> you should try it
[15:48:46] <fgk> but if the live examples don't work, then there is certainly something the matter with firefox
[15:48:48] <dabear> never smoked, never gonna
[15:48:59] <fgk> all in all, a wise choice
[15:49:28] <dabear> fgk: 1) get sober
[15:49:33] <dabear> 2) get sober
[15:49:36] <dabear> 3) get sober
[15:49:38] <fgk> haha
[15:49:48] <fgk> Imperatives for life, or fixing this bug?
[15:49:51] <dabear> that's the 3 step procedure to fixing your coding problems
[15:50:42] <fgk> I mean, it's provably not a problem with my state, if the live examples don't work. But escalating the issue would probably require a bit more focus that I care to muster right now, you're right.
[15:52:47] <Salvager> anyone got anything more to say about my questions?
[15:54:25] <dabear> Salvager: there is nothing more to say, except you can try the code your self
[15:55:31] <Salvager> i am, but there might be something i had missed, which was obvious to you guys
[16:04:19] <Salvager> hash = location.href.substr(location.href.indexOf("#")); is that the hashtag and everything after it?
[16:11:45] <dabear> Salvager: go to http://www.iana.org/domains/example/#foobar
[16:11:56] <dabear> open firebug or webkit dev console
[16:12:06] <dabear> type the following
[16:12:16] <dabear> location.href.substr(location.href.indexOf("#"));
[16:12:19] <dabear> press enter
[16:12:27] <dabear> what do you get? your answer
[16:13:47] <dabear> https://skitch.com/e-bjorninge/ekstb/skitch
[16:14:36] <Salvager> i get an e
[16:16:54] <dabear> ?
[16:20:01] <Whirl3d> you want location.hash
[16:20:38] <Whirl3d> ?
[16:20:56] <Whirl3d> location.hash.substr(1);
[16:21:48] <dabear> he just wants to understand what the code he pasted does
[16:22:17] <dabear> and I was telling him to use the tools available in his browser
[16:23:30] <Whirl3d> it just checks to see if the url contains a hash value (meaning the page was scrolled) and if so, reset the scroll position to the top of the page
[16:24:02] <Whirl3d> but checking the hash to determine if a page has been scrolled is not reliable as you can put anything you want in the hash....
[16:25:18] <poop> if i have an iframe and inside the iframe i include jquery, and then once jquery is all included i do parent.postMessage($); and then receive the message in the parent and assign the message data to a var called '$', can i use jquery like normal?
[16:26:39] <Whirl3d> so that you can avoid loading jquery in the parent?
[16:29:10] <dabear> poop: would not work, must be a string

[16:31:09] <shoky> rohanrhu: donno ajaxform plugin
[16:31:28] <dabear> poop: you cannot stringify a complex object, makes no sense.
[16:34:36] <poop> dabear: why not? should work for any object, sohuldn't it?
[16:34:54] <dabear> no
[16:35:12] <poop> dabear: what makes an object complex?
[16:35:48] <dabear> it contains functions and non string/integer/float keys
[16:35:54] <dabear> values**
[16:37:16] <poop> dabear: you mean you can't stringify an obj with a bool value?
[16:37:34] <dabear> bha
[16:37:38] <dabear> yes you can
[16:37:45] <shoky> NO U DIDNT SAY IT!

[16:41:42] <shoky> nveid: then encode a JSON string.. use JSON.stringify
[16:42:27] <poop> dabear: oh, i see.  because json isn't actually js obj. notation: it's the codified subset by crockford.
[16:42:37] <nveid> i thought data took json
[16:42:49] <shoky> nveid: nope

[16:44:45] <sk8ball> is there a general javascript channel thats not invite only?
[16:45:01] <shoky> sk8ball: ##javascript is not invite only, you need to register your nick
[16:45:17] <dabear> poop: json is a list of key/values. how would you convert a set of statements (like the $ function in jquery) into that?
[16:45:38] <nveid> i wrapped my json in JSON.stringify doesn't make it at all
[16:46:55] <shoky> "doesn't make it" ?
[16:47:25] <nveid> shoky: I'm outputting in the error_log of php of the POST thats reaching it.. Its not getting any post data
[16:49:20] <Nacho> Guys, can I get some help in here http://nacho.io/help, I'm trying to fix the lines in the slideshow
[16:50:50] <sk8ball> shoky, whats the command to register a nick again on freenode?
[16:52:03] <nveid> finally got it.. not sure what exactly i did different..
[16:52:09] <nveid> but i didn't use JSON.stringify
[16:52:14] <dabear> sk8ball: /msg nickserv help
[16:53:06] <shoky> nveid: then you didn't get a JSON string in your php
[16:53:21] <shoky> (which is fine, but not what you said you were after)
[16:55:24] <Nacho> I need to align that line when is doing the slideshow, but I can't figure it out
[16:57:12] <shoky> too much shit going on in your page
[16:57:39] <shoky> frame rate drops critically when moving between slides
[16:57:47] <shoky> it's all janky
[16:58:12] <shoky> and i have no idea what line you're talking about
[17:00:41] <moonsetflies> does anyone have any pointers as of what to do to shrink-wrap a slideshow so the padding doesn't expand 100% width and leave huge white margins on either side of the slide if the browser is long and skinny e.g. in the case of someone with 1366 x 768 resolution, or any viewer if they were to shrink their browser height?

[17:05:48] <shoky> moonsetflies: you want the container to resize each time you switch slides?
[17:08:06] <moonsetflies> hi shoky
[17:09:50] <moonsetflies> i just want to make sure that when you scale the browser vertically (make it long and skinny) or if someone visits it with a long and skinny browser viewport - that they white on either side of the slide doesn't grow. I want to preserve the relationship of about 15px white border on the TOP RIGH and LEFT of the slideshow image no matter what height or width the browser viewport is
[17:10:48] <shoky> top right and left?
[17:11:08] <moonsetflies> yes
[17:11:12] <shoky> the white doesn't grow.. it's the image that is smaller.. so
[17:11:14] <shoky> what?
[17:11:15] <moonsetflies> sorry, typed to quick
[17:11:30] <shoky> dont really understand what you're after
[17:11:34] <moonsetflies> ok
[17:11:41] <moonsetflies> let me illustrate it in photoshop
[17:18:17] <Nacho> shoky: you there
[17:20:28] <solidus-river> is there a way to have jquery search for an element to come into the dom adn call a function when it does?
[17:20:37] <solidus-river> i see on but that appears to only be for interaction
[17:52:57] <Nacho> somebody here?
[17:59:18] <solidus-river> I'm here nacho! :)
[17:59:23] <solidus-river> but i did not hear your question
[19:17:04] <scathen^C> hey all, i need to run a .get() inside a .ajaxComplete(), but I need a way of differentiating between them so i don't get a recurrent loop. The doc says to use the URL, but i was wondering if there was another way?
[19:27:11] <devslash> whats the proper way to get a value of al element using jquery instead of DOM
[19:27:47] <devslash> an element
[19:27:52] <shoky> devslash: what do you mean by value? it's value attribute?
[19:28:02] <shoky> devslash: that'd be .val()
[19:28:32] <devslash> yes
[19:28:39] <devslash> when i inspect my object in firebug
[19:28:56] <devslash> $('#jp_interface_1') is the top level of element
[19:29:51] <shoky> ok
[19:30:03] <devslash> can i link you to my site
[19:30:15] <shoky> why?
[19:30:31] <devslash> ok
[19:30:43] <shoky> you can. i'm asking why? i asnwered your question
[19:30:43] <devslash> so i want to set the background color of my property
[19:30:47] <shoky> and you didnt ask a new one
[19:30:53] <shoky> o
[19:31:34] <shoky> and which part of doing that is troubling you?
[19:32:21] <devslash> theres nested levels of the <ul> i need to go through before it reaches the background attribute
[19:32:26] <devslash> they're nested
[19:33:07] <shoky> how do you find it when you're looking for it?
[19:33:33] <shoky> step 1- it's under #jp_interface_1
[19:33:36] <devslash> im using firebug to view it
[19:33:43] <shoky> step 2- find the <ul>
[19:33:45] <shoky> step 3- ?
[19:34:02] <devslash> how do i access the ul ?
[19:34:09] <shoky> $('#jp_interface_1 ul')
[19:34:19] <shoky> (for example..)
[19:42:02] <devslash> shaky can i pm you
[19:42:11] <devslash> this isn't working
[19:45:46] <shoky> here's good, no?
[19:46:01] <shoky> i hope you set your irc client to ignore joins/parts/quits/etc
[19:46:30] <shoky> you can pm if you really wanna
[19:49:08] * coldhead faps
[20:03:58] <tash1> if I console.log ( $(this) ) it logs a <td> and all it's properties, etc to firebug ... within this <td> is an input type="checkbox" ... how can I do this "if the checkbox in this <td> is checked, then blah"?
[20:04:39] <tash1> right now, I have some code that does if ( $( "input" ).is( ":checked" ) ) {  // }  ... but that seems to be checking every input, not the specific input I want.
[20:05:57] <tash1> i know this probably isn't right, but looking for something along the lines of: if ( $(this) :"input" ).is( ":checked" ) )
[20:07:23] <sahbeewah> $(this).find("input:checked")
[20:09:11] <sahbeewah> $(this).find("input:checked").length
[20:20:04] <xrdodrx> tash1: maybe $(this).find(":checked") ?
[20:20:59] <devslash> is this the right way to get the background attribute ?
[20:21:01] <devslash> $('#jp_interface_1 ul').attr('background');
[20:48:03] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[20:49:06] <spanglesontoast> anyone know what I'm doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/Ec9fNShg
[20:51:45] <ruby_on_tails> spanglesontoast: :checkbox:checked ?
[20:51:53] <ruby_on_tails> why :checked twice ?
[20:52:23] <ruby_on_tails> oops sorry
[20:52:41] <ruby_on_tails> try input[type='checkbox']:checked
[20:55:35] <spanglesontoast> seems to ignore the fact that the checkboxes are checked and still refreshes
[20:55:39] <spanglesontoast> ruby_on_tails: tried that :S
[20:58:55] <ruby_on_tails> spanglesontoast: if ($("#inbox input:checkbox:checked").length > 0) something is definitely wrong here
[20:59:16] <ruby_on_tails> spanglesontoast: got a page i can see ?
[20:59:54] <spanglesontoast> it's generated with php
[21:05:34] <solidus-river> how do i set a data attribute on a dom element with jquery
[21:06:46] <coldhead> $('element').data('pants', false);
[21:07:14] <solidus-river> coldhead: right i actually got the filtering wrong
[21:07:18] <coldhead> solidus-river: read this for the nitty gritty http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[21:07:34] <solidus-river> it appears ".sunburst[data-initialized='false']"
[21:07:36] <solidus-river> is not the right filter
[21:07:43] <solidus-river> how do i filter by the value of a data attribute
[21:15:26] <shoky> solidus-river: your selector looks fine
[21:16:46] <solidus-river> shoky: ah i see
[21:16:56] <solidus-river> shoky: i was using elem.data('initialized', false)
[21:16:59] <solidus-river> when i should have been doing
[21:17:10] <solidus-river> elem.attr('data-initialized', false)
[21:17:23] <solidus-river> wierd distinction for jquery to enforce but whatever
[21:17:27] <shoky> if you want to change the attribute, yeah
[21:17:46] <shoky> the only thing jquery does regarding data-XX attributes is load them once
[21:17:56] <shoky> that's it, it's just some sugar

[21:23:39] <icenynexi> Hey guys. I am having trouble with a jquery getJSON call. All the other json requests in an included js work but this new one keeps sending me a 302 found and the target never gets triggered. Any clue as to why?
[21:25:42] <sente> show some code?

[21:33:58] <icenynexi> sorry
[21:40:06] <icenynexi> sente: I just tried a new approach: http://pastebin.com/WDp0sqnW
[21:40:27] <icenynexi> sente: but it returns an entire page rather than the particular action being called
[21:41:57] <manster> http://jordanstabile.webu.us/ hey guys how can i fix this so that my menu link button images expand/shrink with the window rather than be the same size all the time? thanks
[21:46:41] <icenynexi> $('window').resize($('#img_name').css('font-size','10px')) --- or something to that effect. You would clearly need to add some stuff in there to determine the window width to decide what value to set the link font-size to..
[21:47:04] <icenynexi> i think :-/
