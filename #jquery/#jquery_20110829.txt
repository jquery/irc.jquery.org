[00:00:22] <IgnisDiabolus> dr0id, i see you're trolling here
[00:00:45] <dr0id> did I ? :S
[00:01:55] <rhino_> how can I have a literal / in a js string?
[00:02:24] <coldhead> ?eval 'no / problem, bub';
[00:02:25] <bot-t> coldhead: "no / problem, bub"
[00:02:31] <coldhead> like that
[00:02:37] <coldhead> Just Do It
[00:02:42] <dr0id> ?cc
[00:02:42] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[00:03:56] <nisseni> I'm using this for validation: http://pastie.org/private/ziznuljmtym5knmnhyocsg - However, I want the user to be able to use comma (,) as decimal as well as dot
[00:04:46] <dr0id> you want the user to use both as the decimal separator ?
[00:06:33] <nisseni> yeah, it should accept both
[00:07:45] <dr0id> so basically you will then implement some kind of artificial intelligence to read the user's mind whether he meant 45k while typing 45.000,00 or 45k while typing 45,000.00 or 45, right ?
[00:08:21] <dr0id> let me know when you accomplish that successfully. kthxbai
[00:08:27] <nisseni> that's what I'm aiming for! :P
[00:09:07] <nisseni> but the user aren't using thousand divider sisnce there are never higher numbers than 100
[00:09:13] <nisseni> rarely over 10
[00:17:46] <rhino_> how can I use a literal backslash in a js string?
[00:18:40] <angelkoilov> this: \  ?
[00:19:02] <angelkoilov> rhino_:  ?
[00:19:41] <coldhead> ?eval 'this has a back\\slash'
[00:19:41] <bot-t> coldhead: "this has a back\slash"
[00:19:52] <coldhead> rhino_: ^^
[00:20:13] <coldhead> nisseni: i would use a regular expression to s/,/./
[00:20:17] <coldhead> then leave the validator as is
[00:20:18] <jigz> ?eval 'this is a \n new line'
[00:20:18] <bot-t> jigz: "this is a \n new line"
[00:20:21] <jigz> dog.
[00:20:21] <coldhead> seems least trouble
[00:22:39] <nisseni> coldhead: hoped I wouldn't have to do that, but I'll look into it
[00:27:06] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, There is no strong solution of IE7 png issue rathar than using 8bit png's.. Oterh solutions are very much specific..
[00:27:24] <Paveloosha> it is very very bad..
[00:30:41] <coldhead> the best options are to drop either PNGs or IE
[00:30:42] <coldhead> :)
[00:32:43] <Paveloosha> Yes :) it is best to forget about IE7
[00:33:46] <ty> so peoply
[01:04:44] <IgnisDiabolus> apparently, filter doesn't work :)
[01:05:21] <IgnisDiabolus> i'm testing $('#li').filter(':even').css(<somebackgroundcolor>);
[01:06:32] <sean`> IgnisDiabolus, id's are unique
[01:06:48] <sean`> So there can't be an ':even', only an
[01:06:51] <sean`> ':odd'
[01:06:53] <IgnisDiabolus> sorry
[01:06:57] <IgnisDiabolus> $('li')
[01:07:17] <sean`> .css ('background-color', 'color')
[01:07:22] <IgnisDiabolus> is it maybe because I am generating the html for that <ul>
[01:49:10] <merlin_1991> is there a plugin for a dropdown checklist that also allows "searching" ins the display line as in if the user types the list below gets filtered?
[01:51:37] <mbrevda> How can I update a jqueryui dialog after its been opened?

[01:59:23] <mbrevda> angelkoilov: any option really. Add buttons, change position/size, etc
[02:00:37] <angelkoilov> dialog is wrapped in 1 or 2 elements
[02:01:00] <angelkoilov> u can get $('#myElementId').parent() .... and modify css :)
[02:01:29] <anli_> Is it possible to split a long class attribute?
[02:01:34] <anli_> Its unreadable :)

[02:49:20] <jita> I am new to jquery, here is a website http://fratmusic.com. Whenever i scroll the playlist using the keyboard, it changes the station in the player. Is there any way to scroll through playlists without changing the station? Only clicking on specific playlist should change the station not scrolling through it? Which jquery can solve this ?
[03:01:28] <ThePendulum> jita: Not sure what you mean
[03:01:41] <ThePendulum> jita: I can scroll through the playlist without selecting a station without a problem
[03:02:50] <fasta> How can I replace a bunch of nodes by some other nodes?
[03:03:36] <jita> ThePendulum: like clicking the down arrow in the list changes the station
[03:04:38] <ThePendulum> jita: True. I wonder how many users browse playlists like that though
[03:05:35] <jita> ThePendulum: if i have to change that, is there any option for that ?
[03:06:38] <jita> ThePendulum: youtube works that way
[03:08:27] <fasta> Never mind.
[03:16:21] <ggarri> hi people
[03:16:40] <ggarri> I have a problem with execution of load function in the code
[03:16:57] <ggarri> I have the following output
[03:17:08] <ggarri> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///home/..../centralForm.html. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[03:17:20] <ggarri> how knows why it is happened ?
[03:18:23] <blackspotwiggins> ggarri, you cant load xhr stuff with file://
[03:18:32] <blackspotwiggins> for obvious security reasons
[03:18:45] <ggarri> then ?
[03:18:53] <blackspotwiggins> then there is rainbows and sunshine
[03:19:09] <ggarri> If I want to load I local file, how could I do it ?
[03:19:20] <blackspotwiggins> you cant
[03:19:27] <blackspotwiggins> for obvious security reasons
[03:20:10] <ggarri> then, that it just works online ?
[03:21:17] <ggarri> ok, then, is there other way to load html file from local ?
[03:21:59] <blackspotwiggins> how many times do you have to hear it?
[03:23:28] <ggarri> lol
[03:24:18] <ggarri> ok, but then you are telling me that I cant ever load html code from other file, because there are a obvious security reasons for that
[03:24:23] <ggarri> is it true ?
[03:24:35] <angelkoilov> u can start localserver
[03:25:53] <blackspotwiggins> ggarri, no
[03:26:02] <blackspotwiggins> ffs, you cant load local files not other files
[03:26:24] <ggarri> I need to start a localhost server for that
[03:26:32] <blackspotwiggins> and if you cant figure out why allowing any web page access to any local files, tough luck
[03:26:55] <ggarri> ok
[03:27:00] <ggarri> I understand
[03:27:14] <ggarri> thxs
[03:29:24] <carpediembaby> Hi. does .bind() work on elements newly added through ajax as well?
[03:31:15] <blackspotwiggins> no
[04:04:06] <Trisox> anyone read Test-Driven JavaScript Development  from http://tddjs.com/ ?
[04:11:22] <Vendethiel> Hi, is there a way to check if some elem of a buttonset() is ON ?
[04:13:35] <ThePendulum> You could set a variable as soon as the button gets switched on
[04:13:44] <ThePendulum> var switched = 1;
[04:13:48] <courpse> is $.get async of sync?
[04:13:50] <ThePendulum> as it gets switched off, var switched = 0;
[04:13:56] <courpse> or*
[04:17:30] <chewedon> Hi guys, my Jquery doesn't work on IE 8
[04:17:32] <chewedon> there's no error.
[04:17:39] <chewedon> it works perfectly on Firefox, Chrome
[04:17:56] <knubbze> chewedon: define `doesn't work'
[04:18:20] <chewedon> well, my page performs a ajax jquery request on page load and when I change the drop down list value
[04:18:33] <knubbze> i.e. .change() ?
[04:18:45] <chewedon> let me check
[04:19:15] <knubbze> try .bind($.browser.msie ? 'click' : 'change', [..]) if you're using .change()
[04:19:17] <chewedon> knubbze: yes
[04:19:30] <chewedon> what's [..] ?
[04:19:34] <knubbze> 'click' will also trigger on keyboard change in IE by the way
[04:19:38] <knubbze> [..] is your code
[04:19:47] <chewedon> ok
[04:19:59] <knubbze> e.g.: $('select[name="myselect"]').bind([..]
[04:20:14] <knubbze> oh hi courpse
[04:20:41] <chewedon> ...
[04:20:47] <chewedon> so instead of using .change() I use .bind ?
[04:20:56] <the3rdbit> Hi folks!
[04:21:03] <knubbze> chewedon: yes, quite right
[04:21:27] <the3rdbit> i want to replace a method of a plugin, how can i do this?
[04:21:43] <knubbze> if your code right now reads: $('select').change(function(){alert('hy');}); you change it to $('select').bind($.browser.msie ? 'click' : 'change', function(){alert('hi');});
[04:21:51] <knubbze> the3rdbit: you overwrite it
[04:21:58] <chewedon> $("#stateList").bind($.browser.msie ? 'click' : 'change',function() { ... }));
[04:22:04] <chewedon> doesn't that look right ?
[04:22:14] <knubbze> absolutely
[04:22:17] <Vendethiel> ThePendulum: x.change(function () { switched = !switched; }) ?
[04:22:31] <the3rdbit> knubbze: but how? i don't want to change it in the original file to keep the possibility for updates
[04:22:45] <knubbze> the3rdbit: you don't have to, you can just overwrite it
[04:23:21] <knubbze> use the assignment operator
[04:23:31] <knubbze> myobject.method = function () { .. }
[04:23:46] <chewedon> ..nope...
[04:23:48] <chewedon> didn't fix it
[04:24:01] <knubbze> chewedon: so what's exactly not happening?
[04:24:27] <chewedon> data isn't being pulled through
[04:24:36] <chewedon> I'm making a ajax query to a aspx page
[04:24:39] <knubbze> oh so the event triggers but your AJAX request isnt working?
[04:24:44] <chewedon> and that spits back an xml file
[04:24:54] <the3rdbit> knubbze: how can i eplace it? the code looks like this and i want to replace the method "_equals": (function($) {     methods = {         _equals: function() {             // METHOD         }     } })(jQuery);
[04:24:55] <chewedon> knubbze: the request is working on FIrefox, Chrome, IE 9
[04:25:02] <chewedon> knubbze: just IE 8 doesn't work...
[04:25:29] <chewedon> the page load, I see my drop down list, but I don't see the list of data displayed on the page
[04:25:36] <knubbze> oh okay, I get it now
[04:25:44] <chewedon> and when change the drop down list, nothing gets displayed either
[04:26:14] <knubbze> the3rdbit: you literally can just overwrite it
[04:26:26] <knubbze> myobject.method = function () {..}
[04:26:31] <knubbze> chewedon: hang on a second
[04:26:38] <chewedon> ok
[04:27:01] <chipnt-> hi everyone: Any link i could see how can i center a position:absolute div with random width using jquery?
[04:27:17] <knubbze> chewedon: you probably need to look into ActiveXObject Microsoft.XMLDOM
[04:27:29] <chewedon> o.O
[04:27:36] <chewedon> knubbze: ok..but how can IE 9 work and not IE 8 ?
[04:27:40] <the3rdbit> knubbze: can you please give me an example?
[04:27:54] <knubbze> chipnt-: left: 50%; margin-left: -($(obj).width() / 2);
[04:28:04] <chewedon> did Microsoft decide, hey we're going to screw 70% of web browser users on the planet by making jQuery break on IE 8 ? :D
[04:28:10] <knubbze> chewedon: how would I know
[04:28:20] <knubbze> the3rdbit: yes, example: myobject.method = function () {..}
[04:28:59] <chipnt-> knubbze: thats a $(#id).css(left: 50%; margin-left: -($(obj).width() / 2);
[04:29:00] <chipnt-> right ?
[04:29:07] <knubbze> yes with {} around it
[04:29:14] <Vendethiel> and "" too
[04:29:31] <chipnt-> $(#id).css("left: 50%; margin-left: -($(obj).width() / 2");
[04:29:32] <knubbze> here's the reason for why this works: you put the left edge of the object to 50%
[04:29:40] <chipnt-> am i missing {}
[04:29:41] <knubbze> and then you substract half of its width thereby perfectly centering it
[04:29:46] <chipnt-> ?
[04:29:48] <chipnt-> ok
[04:29:51] <knubbze> chipnt-: $("#id").css({left: [..]
[04:29:56] <chipnt-> ahh right
[04:30:20] <chipnt-> $(#id).css({"left: 50%; margin-left: -($(obj).width() / 2"});
[04:30:21] <knubbze> you probably want to use outerWidth(true) instead of .width though
[04:30:22] <chipnt-> thanks
[04:30:35] <chipnt-> we will see
[04:31:01] <knubbze> for horizontal centering use the same technique only with top: 50%; and margin-top respectively
[04:31:19] <knubbze> vertical centering that is
[04:31:48] <the3rdbit> knubbze: okay and in my case, what would be the name of the method?
[04:31:59] <knubbze> the3rdbit: how would I know?
[04:32:17] <knubbze> you just said that you wanted to change a specific method of an object you had
[04:32:28] <knubbze> so you probably know the methods name
[04:33:43] <the3rdbit> knubbze: sorry i mean the name of the _object_, does it get it when the plugin is initialized? because i can't find any sensfull object name
[04:35:08] <philosophically> got an advanced question i think... anyone know how i would go about wrapping <li> elements that have the same class? basically, take a list of <li> elements, have jquery group them by wrapping them in <ul>'s based on if they share the same class?
[04:37:09] <the3rdbit> knubbze: the plugin looks like this:
[04:37:10] <the3rdbit> (function($) { methods = { _equals: function() { /* METHOD TO REPLACE */ }/* ... */ }, $.fn.validationEngine = function(method) { /* ... */ } })(jQuery);
[04:38:07] <robinsmidsrod> have anyone experienced IE8 on Vista crashing with the qTip plugin? http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/download/
[04:38:42] <robinsmidsrod> we've been using it for some time, and we just upgraded to jQuery 1.6 and now it's able to crash the browser
[04:42:13] <ThePendulum> robinsmidsrod: IE8 AND Vista seriously is a worst case scenario :O
[04:42:39] <nisseni> Vista itself is a worst case scenario...
[04:43:01] <robinsmidsrod> ThePendulum: yeah, but unfortunately that variation is still quite popular, according to our analytics

[04:55:03] <eirikb> Hello. I'm trying to do a post, and want all inputs + another variable. Tried this, but it didn't work: $.post(url, $(':input').serialize() + '&test=frest'); Because .serialize() returns empty string
[04:56:00] <eirikb> Oh, it works now... I probably had a type somewhere. Sorry
[04:57:10] <eirikb> Is this a good way to solve what I'm trying to do btw? I feel that concating in '&test=' looks horrible
[04:58:58] <fasta> I have some jQuery mouseover event, and some object is bound to it in the callback. That callback contains an argument which is the thing clicked on, but how do I get the full representation of that link out of it?
[04:59:02] <djQuery> morn
[04:59:15] <the3rdbit> eirikb: why do you combine post with get variables?
[04:59:33] <eirikb> the3rdbit: To concat in the last variable
[05:00:19] <eirikb> Just doing $.post(url, $(':input')) should do the trick, but how to get in the last variable?
[05:00:44] <the3rdbit> invisible input field? :P
[05:01:05] <eirikb> It's an larger ajax-based application, and the data is not known on the backend at that moment

[05:01:17] <djQuery> .add
[05:01:39] <eirikb> djQuery: For me?
[05:01:50] <djQuery> will that help u then yes
[05:02:02] <eirikb> The variable I want to add is stored as a data attribute on a element
[05:02:13] <eirikb> I'm not sure if just adding a element will help
[05:02:43] <eirikb> I could create a inputfield with jQuery though, but that is more horrible than using .serialize()
[05:03:41] <djQuery> $.post(url, $(':input').map(function(i,elm){ })
[05:04:05] <eirikb> How will map help?
[05:05:00] <djQuery> well u had  this $.post(url, $(':input'))  thats gonna return a jquery object not what u want to post
[05:05:33] <djQuery> .serialize would probably be the best serialize it to a var then add your items to the array
[05:05:46] <eirikb> Yes, but the other variable is stored as a data-attribute. I don't think appending the object (of the element) will help
[05:06:38] <jb-> http://jsfiddle.net/LBwEL/1/ Can someone tell me why uid is still null at the end of get_uid()?
[05:06:57] <DarsVaeda> Hi, is there any way to get around var x = $(element).val(); writing the string "null" to x when element is a select list with nothing selected?
[05:07:18] <eirikb> djQuery: Pretty much what I do now then :)
[05:08:18] <djQuery> var x = $('#myForm').serialze(); $('[data-attr]').each(function(i,elm){  x[whatever] = $(this).data('attr');  });  $.post(url, x);
[05:08:59] <eirikb> x would be a String in that case, so your code would probably fail
[05:09:24] <the3rdbit> jb-: use your console! "Uncaught ReferenceError: get_uid is not defined"
[05:09:27] <djQuery> eirikb: cool just append to the sting instead
[05:09:38] <jb-> the3rdbit: What console -.-
[05:09:41] <eirikb> And that is what I do :)

[05:17:04] <jb-> I'm working on a Chrome extension and its being a bitch
[05:17:25] <djQuery> jb-: an extension or a user script?
[05:17:36] <jb-> djQuery: Extension
[05:19:43] <djQuery> ?imabot@ the3rdbit
[05:19:43] <bot-t> the3rdbit, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[05:21:37] <djQuery> ThePendulum: it looks fine, however it doesnt work fine. it should stop me form posting with no info populated.
[05:22:03] <jb-> Why can't this be simple/
[05:22:13] <djQuery> ThePendulum: and placeholders are nice but not a replacement for labels
[05:22:23] <the3rdbit> djQuery: lol
[05:24:01] <ace__> Hi, I'm trying to port some jquery to yui, and this line is giving me a tough time $mq("#avCarouselInner SPAN").live("click", function () {}); When I rewrite it as Y.all("#avCarouselInner SPAN".on("click",function(){}); I get no error, but the event doesnt work as expected any ideas?
[05:24:20] <the3rdbit> jb-: I use the same console and if you know the main functions of it, it's really smple
[05:24:52] <jb-> Well I don't know the main functions of it
[05:24:57] <jb-> So it's really not simple
[05:25:35] <jb-> There aren't any errors showing up ..
[05:25:58] <Vendethiel> ace__: ask #yui
[05:26:21] <ace__> Vendethiel: asked there as well
[05:26:35] <djQuery> jb-: did you look at the article I linked to?
[05:26:42] <jb-> Yes
[05:26:55] <djQuery> jb-: it has excelent info on using the bebugers
[05:27:03] <the3rdbit> jb-: maybe this is easier: http://code.google.com/intl/de/chrome/devtools/docs/console.html
[05:27:27] <djQuery> jb- there is also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI
[05:28:44] <djQuery> ace__: well u seem to be missing a ) in the y code that u pasted
[05:29:52] <ace__> djQuery: I just typed that in, was an error, let me pastie my exact methods
[05:30:03] <djQuery> no thanks
[05:30:13] <djQuery> never looked at y before
[05:30:37] <ace__> affirmative
[05:30:53] <djQuery> I have never looked at y before
[05:32:39] <jb-> I think I'm just gonna go jump off a bridge -.- sounds like more fun that javascript
[05:32:55] <ace__> jb-: what issue are you having?
[05:33:14] <ThePendulum> Dude that was a bit harsh... a friend of mine jumped off a bridge
[05:33:59] <jb-> ace__: var uid = "none"; alert(uid); brings up a box with nothing in it
[05:34:10] <ace__> ...
[05:34:19] <ace__> all browsers?
[05:34:45] <ace__> I'm assuming thats with a clean page with nothing else on it, you get an empty alert still?
[05:34:50] <jb-> It's a Chrome extension, I can't test it in other browsers
[05:35:01] <ace__> what extension?
[05:35:20] <jb-> It's not in the web store
[05:35:36] <ace__> so its something I dont have access to?
[05:35:55] <ace__> like tell me what your using and if I can get it, so I can try to help...
[05:35:59] <jb-> Pretty much. I can throw the source code up on Github real quick if you want
[05:36:14] <ace__> sure I can take a look
[05:36:19] <ace__> link me
[05:36:21] <ace__> brb
[05:36:23] <jb-> Back in a second
[05:38:48] <NetCerW>  jsfiddle run button is not working at the moment.
[05:39:11] <dr0id> are you the creator of jsfiddle ?
[05:39:32] <NetCerW> no
[05:39:41] <jb-> ace__: https://github.com/james-brewer/HN-Notifier
[05:42:08] <jb-> Anyone here know how to play a guitar?
[05:48:10] <ace__> jb-: this code isnt live anywhere yet where I can test it on the browser right?
[05:48:47] <jb-> ace__: If you download it then you can test it with Google Chrome
[05:48:55] <jb-> ace__: But no, it isn't live anywhere
[05:50:35] <ace__> ok, ill look at it, im actually at work, so ill respond when I can, hopefully you figure it out before then
[05:51:51] <jb-> I'm gonna leave it until later. I've been working on this for too long (and making no progress .. at all) and I'm ready to throw my laptop through a window.
[05:54:08] <jb-> If anyone has a recommendation on where I can learn about this asynchronous shit I would LOVE to hear it.
[05:54:22] <jb-> Just PM it to me cause I might not be paying attention :S
[05:54:54] <ace__> google it...
[05:55:12] <jb-> I will if no one has an suggestions
[05:55:22] <jb-> I'm silly like that -- I trust people more than I trust Google
[05:56:02] <Zopieux> things work in reverse; people are not free enough to answser questions before they've been searched on the web.
[05:56:45] <jb-> Fuck off
[05:56:46] <ace__> http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=javascript+asynchronous+explanation&pbx=1&oq=javascript+asynchronous+explanation&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=342l8108l0l8252l27l20l0l0l0l0l258l2229l9.10.1l20l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&fp=48e36fe3703d6013&biw=1050&bih=1567
[05:57:13] <jb-> Excuse me for asking for javascript resources in a javascript-related IRC channel
[05:57:17] <ace__> you can start with the wiki, and just read
[05:57:49] <ace__> I agree with Zopieux, no disrespect but you should do your research first, then ask for help... I've been guilty before though, just my 2 cents...
[05:57:50] <ace__> bbl
[05:59:20] <ace__> looks like I needed y.on("click",function(){},context); instead of whatever I was using...
[06:01:31] <ajpiano> jb-:  http://nathansjslessons.appspot.com/lesson?id=1090
[06:01:33] <Sean-Der> Sorry for the question but what is the selector for all select boxes on a page?
[06:01:47] <ajpiano> $("select")
[06:01:57] <Sean-Der> Thank you!
[06:04:40] <Sean-Der> if ($("select") == "Y" OR "N")
[06:04:53] <Sean-Der> Is that the correct usage?
[06:06:32] <ajpiano> Sean-Der: lol, no
[06:06:51] <ajpiano> Sean-Der: are you actively avoiding trying to learn javascript
[06:06:58] <Vendethiel> :o
[06:07:17] <Sean-Der> No I am sorry that my attempts to learn are making you so irritated though
[06:07:37] <ajpiano> Sean-Der: you know there are like, resources for basic syntactic things like this
[06:07:51] <ajpiano> i'm just saying it's been like weeks and weeks and you still think that OR is something you can use in JS
[06:08:01] <ThePendulum> rotfl
[06:08:01] <anli_> if (y_or_n($('#select option:selected').text()); function y_or_n(input){ return input == 'Y' || input == 'N'}
[06:08:17] <anli_> oops, not #select
[06:09:19] <OnkelTem> Can't do a simple thing - for a subtree find element and remove it. How?
[06:09:26] <Sean-Der> ajpiano: I have been using javascript for about a week now I came here from PHP. I am sorry if I am not as adept as you, but there is no need to be rude
[06:09:33] <Vendethiel> if ($x.text() in ['N', 'Y']) ?
[06:09:45] <OnkelTem> $('form').remove('label') - doesn't work
[06:10:00] <ajpiano> Sean-Der:  i'm pretty sure it's been more than a week.
[06:10:15] <OnkelTem> How to select all descendants?
[06:10:27] <ajpiano> .find("*")
[06:11:43] <OnkelTem> ajpiano: thank you! I tried children(), filter() :)
[06:11:44] <ajpiano> Sean-Der: var foo = $("#someSelect").val();  if (foo == "Y" || foo == "N") { } would be the most basic way of writing that
[06:12:01] <Vendethiel> if ($x.text() in ['N', 'Y']) ?
[06:12:16] <Sean-Der> ajpiano: I just ended up using .val and having my empty selection = F
[06:12:23] <Sean-Der> ed up using .val and having my empty selection = F
[06:12:27] <Sean-Der> Thank you for your help though
[06:12:33] <ajpiano> Vendethiel: "in" only works on objects, not arrays
[06:12:46] <Sean-Der> <option value="F" selected='selected'></option>
[06:12:55] <Vendethiel> in {N: 1, Y: 1}
[06:13:06] <ajpiano> ?eval "y" in  {"y": "abc"}
[06:13:08] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[06:13:26] <ajpiano> ?eval "y" in  ["y", "a", "b", "c"]
[06:13:27] <bot-t> ajpiano: false
[06:13:33] <Vendethiel> ?eval "y" in {y: 1}
[06:13:34] <bot-t> Vendethiel: true
[06:14:18] <Baribal> Hi. I'm pretty new to jQuery and I'm still stumbling through the documentation... So... I've got a <select id="foo">, how can I react to onchange events the jQuery way?
[06:14:37] <ajpiano> $("#foo").change(function(e) {   });
[06:15:32] <Baribal> Thanks, ajpiano. What reference could I use to look up that it's the .change method?
[06:15:37] <ajpiano> ?change
[06:15:38] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[06:15:58] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/category/events
[06:17:39] <dr0id> hola ajpiano
[06:19:28] <ajpiano> heya
[06:23:01] <Sean-Der> If I do a .val on multiple $("select")  it's only going to grab one of the values correct?
[06:23:10] <ajpiano> incorrect, it's gonna return an array
[06:23:43] <Sean-Der> Is there a way to visualize my return like PHPs print_r
[06:23:57] <ajpiano> you can use all the console methods
[06:24:07] <ajpiano> has anyone linked you to see ?ftj
[06:24:07] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:24:35] <Sean-Der> No I have never seen this. Thank you looking now
[06:26:40] <Sean-Der> ajpiano: Wow Firebug rocks! I figured out it wasn't my JS it was my HTML
[06:26:48] <ajpiano> wooo
[06:26:51] <Sean-Der> Thank you hopefully less stupid questions now
[06:27:12] <ajpiano> yeah, if you aren't using a debugger, it's a lot easier to not know the answer to basic stuff about your own code ;)
[06:27:23] <ajpiano> gluck!
[06:27:29] <Sean-Der> Sorry for not trying to learn more I have gotten to dependent on you guys! Thanks for all the help
[06:27:42] <viper> hi

[06:27:46] <ajpiano> as well
[06:28:52] <Guest32737> i need to bind a click event on a div with a particula id that is created by another click event with .html...how can i do that? have I to use delegate function? i'm trying it but without success
[06:29:07] <dr0id> ?live
[06:29:07] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/

[06:29:16] <Guest32737> yep
[06:29:23] <Guest32737> but it didn't work!
[06:29:25] <ajpiano> Guest32737: you have to use delegate on a container that remains in the DOM the whole time
[06:29:44] <Guest32737> ajpiano i was thinking that
[06:30:51] <Guest32737> .delegate(selector*, 'click', function(a) { blablabla } ), * this selector is my div who doesn't still exists in dom?
[06:31:04] <chipnt-> I have an external ad wich i have to check if it outputs smth or not. It is a js script inside content div http://pastebin.com/L4Wkv3gF
[06:31:08] <chipnt-> how could i do it?
[06:31:19] <ajpiano> Guest32737: the selector doesn't have to be in the dom, the thing you call it on $("#foo") has to be
[06:31:42] <Guest32737> ok thanks i'm going to try it
[06:40:15] <al3xnull_> I feel like I've done this before, but for some reason, but when I put a remove statement in the slideUp callback, it's called immediately after mouseout.
[06:40:17] <al3xnull_> https://gist.github.com/1178410
[06:40:39] <al3xnull_> Is this due to the fact that it's contained within a hover, or is there a better way to do what I'm trying to accomplish?
[06:43:08] <polygon-pusher> I have a site that makes post calls to a device that is on the local network via a local ip, example 192.168.0.102. I use http post calls to contol the device. I get an error becuase of cross domain issues. http://Origin  is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Any advice. The thing is I dont need the post to return anything
[06:44:03] <polygon-pusher> heres the sites http://roku-remote.com for any of you roku owners out there.
[06:44:26] <blackspotwiggins> polygon-pusher, the local server must set the said header
[06:44:33] <blackspotwiggins> no other way rly
[06:45:04] <polygon-pusher> I thought this was the same issues people had when loading from say flickr on their site
[06:45:59] <polygon-pusher> I seen that what I needed to do was change the header to say Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * but how is that done with jquery $.post()
[06:46:50] <blackspotwiggins> polygon-pusher, that header needs to be set on server
[06:47:05] <alky> hi guys, i got a dynamic array with product ids and i have an ajax function which accepts the productid and callbacks parameters, i want to loop through the array and send as callback: the same function with the next product id (sorry for the bad english)
[06:47:09] <polygon-pusher> so in short the device I'm calling
[06:47:31] <blackspotwiggins> anyway the request should go through
[06:47:36] <alky> what is that called and how can i do it?
[06:47:37] <blackspotwiggins> but you cant get the response
[06:47:45] <blackspotwiggins> unless you set the headers
[06:47:53] <polygon-pusher> it does but then I get an error on the return which if I could I would like to stop
[06:48:15] <blackspotwiggins> you could catch {} it i suppose
[06:48:20] <blackspotwiggins> but that would eat other errors too
[06:48:22] <polygon-pusher> is there no way to send and not receive?
[06:48:28] <blackspotwiggins> if that's acceptable for you
[06:48:50] <Shaan> hello all
[06:49:24] <Shaan> is there someone who can alert the jquery administrator that some stupid guy post stuff in plugin but it's not plugin , it's just advert
[06:49:25] <sigwhite> Is there something similar to masonry that supports drag & drop sorting?
[06:51:21] <sigwhite> ... this is probably a stupid question as masonry ignores order to the benefit of minimized whitespace.
[06:52:44] <anli_> Anyone else that have experienced that the error console in ff does not show all errors, for instance when a function is undefined and you try to call it?
[06:53:11] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, you are catching the error somewhere
[06:53:19] <anli_> Hm, dont think so
[06:53:32] <anli_> I am not using catch anywhere
[06:58:59] <Innocentus> hi
[06:59:09] <Innocentus> I get further and further increasing values from height() :(
[06:59:11] <Innocentus> why
[07:00:11] <ablomen> Innocentus, because the element gets bigger? we can't help you without an example
[07:01:53] <Innocentus> it is very complicated
[07:02:01] <Innocentus> what exactly does height do?
[07:02:09] <dr0id> lol ?
[07:02:16] <Innocentus> it doesn't use the css-height as described in jquery docs
[07:02:37] <Innocentus> I mean, what parameters are used for height() function?
[07:02:47] <dr0id> it gives you yhe height of the element
[07:02:52] <dr0id> or the dom node, w/e you call it
[07:06:01] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/RtnTEhQT
[07:06:11] <Sean-Der> I am having a hard time using .each for form validation
[07:06:29] <Sean-Der> If one of .val doesn't return to Y the form will pass
[07:07:08] <Cork[home]> ?.serializeArray @ Sean-Der
[07:07:09] <bot-t> Sean-Der, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/

[07:10:48] <ChristianAdamski> Hi, how can I select every 3rd element?
[07:11:26] <ChristianAdamski> like, $('X') would select 100 elements, and I want to modify 3, 6, 9, ...
[07:11:40] <ChristianAdamski> is there an easy way?
[07:12:23] <Cork[home]> ?:nth-child @ ChristianAdamski
[07:12:24] <bot-t> ChristianAdamski, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[07:12:35] <Cork[home]> oh wrong one
[07:13:05] <ChristianAdamski> yeah...
[07:13:20] <ChristianAdamski> I saw that one too, but it dows not work as intended..
[07:13:48] <Cork[home]> ChristianAdamski: ya, the one i thought of is :nth-of-type
[07:13:56] <Cork[home]> but jquery doesn't add compatibility for that one
[07:14:13] <ChristianAdamski> I could traverse over alle elements and skip some, but that seems more compley then nessacary
[07:14:37] <Cork[home]> ChristianAdamski: thats funamentaly what an :nth would do anyway
[07:14:38] <ChristianAdamski> necessary...
[07:14:54] <ajpiano> ChristianAdamski: .filter(function(i) { return i % 3 == 0  }).doSomething() might be your best bet
[07:15:05] <ajpiano> but :nth-child will obvs only work on children
[07:15:54] <ChristianAdamski> ah, thx
[07:28:20] <Sean-Der> Does jQuery have an equivalent of in_array? I have my array and looking at my console log I have it setup they way I want it
[07:29:03] <Sean-Der> Found it never mind
[07:29:32] <tbranyen> inArray xD
[07:29:51] <ChristianAdamski> Cork, ajpiono: FYI: $('whatever:nth-child(3n+2)) actually works :)
[07:30:17] <ajpiano> ChristianAdamski: i knew it would work in theory but whether it would work for your usecase was unclear
[07:30:30] <ajpiano> as to whether all the elems were children of the same thing or you just wanted set-based index regardlesss of dom pos
[07:31:11] <ChristianAdamski> ajpiano: it works fine, thx!
[07:32:26] <joe1210> can anybody figure our why this doesn't work?  http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/
[07:35:42] <joe1210> Can anybody help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/
[07:37:35] <Dave-Stein> hey is ui-resizable supposed to fire a resize event on window, or is there a lovely bit of hidden code on my own site?
[07:38:06] <joe1210> It should fire a resize event on a window. I think.
[07:38:14] <dr0id> In My app on Hostgator, the Ajax requests get queued up sometimes and all of them fail - any idea how to fix this issue ? Customer is shouting on me :S
[07:39:03] <joe1210> I have the same problem but for me it isn't so bad. Maybe     $(this).unbind('click'); and then rebind it?
[07:39:43] <Dave-Stein> eh the bug that's happening is so minor on my site i'm gonna skip over it for now
[07:39:51] <Dave-Stein> it's hidden far far away in a dark place ha
[07:40:29] <joe1210> Can anybody help me with my .delay function. It doesn't work and I can't understad it.  http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/1/
[07:41:16] <Veve> hiya.anyone here? :)
[07:41:16] <pickels> Can I just do $.trigger('event') or do you always need an element to use the trigger method?
[07:41:33] <Dave-Stein> you have to fix the fiddle cause it was set on mootools :)
[07:42:20] <Dave-Stein> i *think* you always need an element
[07:42:34] <pickels> alright
[07:42:39] <joe1210> There you go: http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/2/
[07:42:42] <Dave-Stein> i just had same issue recently but if you're doing events withotu elements you wouldnt need to use bind / trigger
[07:42:42] <Veve> I need help w/ refresh monkey and I'm no coding freak,so I've no idea how to run it
[07:43:12] <Dave-Stein> you would just need to pass a callback function where you want to "trigger"
[07:43:18] <Dave-Stein> and then use callback.call( this, args )
[07:43:55] <Dave-Stein> and youre missing your markup joe so nothing would fade in to see whats broken
[07:44:41] <joe1210> where am I missing my markup?(I'm not very good at advanced coding/understanding the language)
[07:45:07] <Dave-Stein> your fiddle has all the JS but not the HTML
[07:46:23] <Dave-Stein> $('#el).fadeTo("slow", 1).delay(800).fadeTo("slow", 0); that line should work fine
[07:46:35] <Dave-Stein> it would seem to me that you just have a typo somewhere in HTML so youre not pointing at right element
[07:47:19] <joe1210> It fades in but it won't fade back out so I have no idea what is going wrong.
[07:47:37] <Dave-Stein> you probably have a line later in execution that removes the element then
[07:47:42] <Dave-Stein> delay doesnt stop your code from running
[07:47:55] <Dave-Stein> so if you have delay and then 10 lines later remove the element, it will be gone before fade in
[07:48:35] <Dave-Stein> unless thats all your JS on the page
[07:48:44] <Dave-Stein> its hard to tell without HTMl and CSS
[07:50:08] <pwf> what's a common place to store parameters for my ajax requests... that's poorly worded, but what I mean is I'm going to have multiple generated links, and I want each to pass a different parameter. should I store that parameter in a hidden field, or in an attribute, or what?
[07:50:33] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/GSNBn1tA
[07:50:46] <Sean-Der> If I take my array to console I can see that "F" exists
[07:51:02] <Sean-Der> However inArray is giving me -1 for "F" doesn't exist in the array?
[07:52:09] <joe1210> Thats all the jquery
[07:52:49] <Dave-Stein> hm i dunno what's wrong at all then sorry
[07:52:59] <Dave-Stein> youre also fading from 1 to 0
[07:53:04] <joe1210> Do you want my HTML?
[07:53:04] <Dave-Stein> so youre making it appear and then disappear
[07:53:07] <Dave-Stein> so nothing would bring it back
[07:53:16] <Dave-Stein> what did you intend to happen?
[07:53:26] <pwf> Sean-Der: serializeArray creates an array of objects like { 'name': 0, 'value': 'F' } (i think)
[07:53:40] <pwf> what do you get when you do alert(arr)
[07:53:50] <erichynds> Sean-Der: $.inArray() doesn't work like that
[07:54:01] <Dave-Stein> HTML would help cause then i can run the whole thing in the fiddle :)
[07:54:06] <erichynds> Sean-Der: you'll need to look through it and test the value key of each object within the array
[07:54:13] <joe1210> I want a div to fade in, wait for a specified time say 800 ms, then fadeout and something will fade back in
[07:54:28] <_ramo1> hi
[07:55:07] <_ramo1> if i have a set of e.g. 20 data, that are editable, is there a possibility in jquery to add a custom form to each of this items?
[07:55:24] <joe1210> http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/4/
[07:55:40] <fasta> I have <a href="blah" id="myid">TEXT</a>. Now, document.getElementById('myid').clientHeight returns 0. How do I get the height of the text?
[07:56:18] <Dave-Stein> you can use jquery to get css of line-height, that would be my guess fasta
[07:56:34] <Dave-Stein> also why wouldy ou use clientHeight when using jquery... its diff in diff browsers
[07:56:51] <fasta> Dave-Stein: I did not know that jQuery could also do it.
[07:56:54] <jcDesigns> Any pros on here that can answer a question?
[07:57:04] <fasta> Dave-Stein: how exactly?
[07:57:08] <Brodingo> so many pros
[07:57:11] <Dave-Stein> $('#el').height()
[07:58:29] <Dave-Stein> $('#el').css('line-height');
[07:58:29] <joe1210> @dave-stein http://jsfiddle.net/FAH67/4/
[07:58:29] <fasta> Dave-Stein: are those the same?
[07:58:29] <fasta> Dave-Stein: I will just read the manual :)
[07:58:29] <Dave-Stein> yeah check manual
[07:58:29] <jcDesigns> i have asked this before, last week, but never got an answer. I just need to know WHY something works
[07:58:29] <Dave-Stein> they are diff
[07:58:29] <Dave-Stein> im looking joe
[07:58:35] <jcDesigns> i have a flyout menu, when you roll-over the li, it displays the submenu...simple enough
[07:58:54] <jcDesigns> but it uses this: .css({visibility : "visible", display : "none"}).show(400);
[07:59:29] <jcDesigns> without the visibility:visible, the submenu will not show again after the first roll over.
[07:59:49] <ablomen> jcDesigns, does it set visibility: hidden somewhere?
[07:59:51] <jcDesigns> Why would you need visibility:visible set, when you hide it right away with display:none
[07:59:54] <Dave-Stein> joe, first off you dont need to do div#id
[07:59:55] <Dave-Stein> thats bad
[07:59:56] <Dave-Stein> just do #id
[07:59:57] <jcDesigns> on hover off, yes
[08:00:10] <ablomen> jcDesigns, well there you go
[08:00:26] <ablomen> jcDesigns, remove all the visibilty related stuff, you should only need to use display
[08:00:42] <Dave-Stein> people can use visibility to hide an element and then slide it up so that elements below dont jerk cause of something fading out
[08:00:58] <jcDesigns> but if you remove all the visibility, then the display:block/none, doesn't work propersly on its own
[08:01:02] <Dave-Stein> joe i also dont see an image with the id "left"
[08:01:12] <Dave-Stein> nm
[08:01:44] <ablomen> jcDesigns, then you are doing something wrong, maybe it is also hidden with visibility: hidden in the css?
[08:01:59] <Dave-Stein> you need to fix the indents in your code joe but uhhh i looked
[08:02:05] <Dave-Stein> and when i click "map"
[08:02:08] <Dave-Stein> it does the fade back in and out
[08:02:11] <Dave-Stein> and then removes the element i clicked
[08:02:17] <Dave-Stein> so it looks like its fine for what ou coded
[08:03:14] <Sean-Der> pwf: I am trying to get it so if "F" exists anywhere in an array I am getting it will stop a form submit
[08:03:31] <Sean-Der> Just having a hell of a time getting this to work
[08:04:06] <pwf> you'll have to loop over the array yourself then i think
[08:04:36] <pwf> inArray only checks the values themselves... it won't actually open up the objects like you're expecting it to
[08:04:46] <Sean-Der> Crud I mine as well test each select individually
[08:04:54] <pwf> yeah :/
[08:05:09] <pwf> inArray will check if { name="billProblem", value="F"} == "F"
[08:05:11] <pwf> and it never will
[08:05:33] <crankharder> when I add .select() to a radio button in jquery mobile, the event doesn't fire when the radio button is selected... should I be attaching select to something else?
[08:05:37] <Dave-Stein> inArray wont work on {}, just []
[08:05:50] <jcDesigns> AHHHHHHH.....Dave-S. was right. It is there to prevent the jerkiness if you roll over a bunch of things quickly.
[08:05:53] <Dave-Stein> or so i thoguth
[08:07:52] <Dave-Stein> var x = { a : 1, b : 2 };
[08:07:52] <Dave-Stein> var y = [ 1, 2 ];
[08:07:52] <Dave-Stein> console.log( $.inArray( 1, x ) );
[08:07:52] <Dave-Stein> console.log( $.inArray( 1, y ) );
[08:07:58] <Dave-Stein> youll never get 0 for x
[08:10:20] <Sean-Der> pwf: Would it be better to use .each and grab .val from all the selects?
[08:11:07] <pwf> if it works then it's better :) i'm not sure about optimal though
[08:11:09] <pwf> i'm no pro...
[08:11:38] <polygon-pusher> what can I do if I dont have a way to change header on a local server but I can read a xml file from it. I need to be able to load and read an xml file but I keep gitting the "XMLHttpRequest cannot load -Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[08:12:10] <Dave-Stein> sean-der: i would just each through the object and compare, when you find 'F' just return false
[08:12:15] <Dave-Stein> that will stop the $.each from iterating more than it needs to
[08:12:36] <Dave-Stein> returning false in the each will NOT stop form submission, youll need to do that after the each, if that's from a bind to submit
[08:13:15] <Dave-Stein> i have a dumb irc question while im here, how do i make my text red? :)
[08:13:17] <Sean-Der> Dave-Stein: Uggh I seriously can't do a return false; inside of a each
[08:13:29] <Sean-Der> Type their name in the query
[08:13:39] <Dave-Stein> Sean-Der really?
[08:13:42] <Dave-Stein> didnt work for me haha
[08:13:45] <Sean-Der> Yep!
[08:13:50] <Dave-Stein> oh you see it read?
[08:13:50] <Sean-Der> My text shows up red
[08:13:53] <Dave-Stein> gotcha
[08:14:05] <Sean-Der> Dave-Stein: This is how most people do it
[08:14:05] <Dave-Stein> Sean-Der returning false inside $.each just stops loop, which is good
[08:14:31] <Dave-Stein> $('#form').bind('submit', function( e ) { $.each( obj, function() { ... do checking ..  } if ( found ) { return false; }  }
[08:14:48] <Dave-Stein> i know i made a syntax error somewhere ha
[08:15:16] <Sean-Der> Dave-Stein: Dang that's some fast code there! Haah I will start playing with it I have only used delegate never bind
[08:15:47] <Dave-Stein> haha np
[08:20:26] <Sean-Der> Dave-Stein: Sorry to bother you is this something along the lines of what you were suggesting?
[08:20:35] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/WUNn08GH
[08:21:23] <Dave-Stein> one sec

[08:22:57] <madjoe> hi! can somebody help me out with the right approach, please? I'm using this plugin and would like to set a different interval for the first slide only! how would I do that? http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/autoscroll.html
[08:23:41] <madjoe> first transition should last for 12 sec. and all the rest should last for 8sec.
[08:26:01] <madjoe> Here's the standalone demo: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/scrollable/plugins/chain.htm
[08:27:25] <ryrych> what service would you suggest to embed youtube video using oembed with jsonp? as I want to make my widget public I donâ€™t want to pay for embedly (former oohembed)

[08:38:06] <Endless> Hi. Can some js regexp guru help me geting the filename from some possible values: this is what i have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/CP9w8/1/
[08:38:34] <kboers> I stole some code from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/220767/auto-refreshing-div-with-jquery to pull in some unittest results while they are running. Can anyone help me figure out how to stop the div from refreshing once the tests have completed?
[08:40:52] <come-on-irene> hey gents, question for ya: how do I escape double quotes like these? http://pastie.org/2449156
[08:41:15] <come-on-irene> they're inside of an image tag, so I can't go with the whole backwards slash \ turns to ;quot& business
[08:42:06] <madjoe> How do I change the interval for the first transition here? http://jsfiddle.net/eFyve/1/ (first "slide" should last for 10 seconds, all the other slides should last as they do now...)
[08:42:58] <madjoe> Here's a small tutorial of used plugin: http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/autoscroll.html
[08:45:48] <Endless> need some help getting the filename from a array: http://jsfiddle.net/CP9w8/1/
[08:46:20] <pwf> anyone use DataTables?
[08:48:00] <kboers> Anyone know how to stop a div from auto-refreshing (using window.setTimeout)? http://jsfiddle.net/fMSy9/
[08:53:17] <nail_> kboers: var foo = window.setTimeout(.....); then use clearTimeout(foo) if you want to cancel it
[08:54:09] <kboers> @nail_: Thanks! If I dynamically insert that into the page via update(), will it execute?
[08:54:53] <kboers> @nail_: Like, if when the tests complete, /random starts returning clearTimeout(foo)
[08:55:10] <madjoe> How do I change the interval for the first transition here? http://jsfiddle.net/eFyve/1/ (first "slide" should last for 10 seconds, all the other slides should last as they do now...)
[08:56:09] <kboers> @nail_: or maybe I can add logic to the anonymous callback function to check for some blob of text in the response to decide whether or not to run window.setTimeout()
[08:57:07] <nail_> kboers: <script> tags are evaluated yes, but "foo" must be accessible globally then
[08:57:33] <kboers> @nail_: Okay, guess I need to go read up on scoping in js
[08:58:01] <kboers> @nail_ Thanks again for the direction!
[08:58:13] <nail_> no worry :)
[08:58:42] <ryrych> anyone? :)
[08:59:37] <sflach88> Hey guys, I am using accordion in combination with autocomplete
[09:00:50] <danzik17> Endless: Took a minute, but http://jsfiddle.net/CP9w8/9/
[09:01:03] <sflach88> and I do have a weird issue. if i run the html file from the local hard disk, the autocomplete works in all input fields where it is added to - though if i open exactly that html file from a network drive, autocomplete does work only in the first input field
[09:03:04] <Endless> danzik17 thanks can you do one where the .ext is not included also?
[09:03:23] <robin27th> hi, i couldn't figure out how to set timezone in croogo. the default is 0, i want to set GMT+6. puting just 6 in the setting doesn't work. pls help.
[09:04:41] <danzik17> Endless: Yes, but it's a good opportunity to learn.  Look into modifying my regexp with a positive lookahead for the portion matching the .ext
[09:05:15] <danzik17> Endless: Or create a matching group on the portion that you're interested in (probably the better option)
[09:05:36] <Endless> ok

[10:18:07] <Swimming_Bird> there any tricks to getting delegate to work? $body.delegate('a.fb_share','click',launchFbShare); isn't working for me.
[10:18:35] <Swimming_Bird> i'd rather not use .live() because i don't want the time it takes for the selector to run the first time
[10:20:09] <Brodingo> Swimming_Bird need more content / code / demo
[10:20:37] <Swimming_Bird> pretty much just want any link with the class fb_share on the dom at any point to fire the launchFbShare func.
[10:20:41] <Swimming_Bird> and it's not
[10:21:22] <Swimming_Bird> it's pretty much just that one line of code. i could replace launchFbShare with function(ev) {ev.preventDefault();console.log("HI I'm HERE")}

[10:24:48] <Swimming_Bird> Brodingo, any thoughts on my issue?
[10:25:07] <Brodingo> make sure $body is what you expect
[10:26:07] <Brodingo> make sure your function is defined
[10:26:20] <Brodingo> i dunno, thats why a demo is always better

[10:58:14] <Zeelot> I have an onclick event using jquery on a checkbox and use event.preventDefault(), $(this).is(':checked') is giving me what the checkbox would be if I didn't prevent default, any ideas?
[10:59:04] <jigz> try return false - i remember checkboxes being weird like that
[10:59:42] <Zeelot> but I need to see if it's checked in the onclick event which is where it's inaccurate
[10:59:49] <Zeelot> so do I just assume the opposite? =/
[11:00:12] <Zeelot> the preventDefault() is actually working, I see the checkbox on the page and it is not changing state
[11:00:58] <Zeelot> I logged the element which I see having an attribute checked="checked" and then logged $(this).is(':checked') which is giving me false
[11:01:17] <fayimora> hey guys wats the best book to read to learn javascript
[11:01:30] <jigz> if its not checked, than is(':checked') will be false

[11:35:48] <raiun> I'm trying to implement an ajax search, but my approach with jquery might be wrong.  I'm using .change() on my text input and then doing an ajax call inside of the callback for change.  but nothing seems to be happening
[11:36:01] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: thats what the html5 standard says should be done with them
[11:36:15] <raiun> so whats the best way to make those calls as a user is filling in a text input?
[11:36:27] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: dont like it just use .attr instead
[11:36:53] <unclemantis> tomasm- i don't see anything out of the ordinary
[11:36:58] <kborchers> raiun: have you looked at the jQuery UI autocomplete widget?
[11:37:05] <raiun> kborchers no
[11:37:09] <djQuery> ?.ui.autocomplete@raiun

[11:37:29] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: why should jQuery read + convert my data-attributes at all?
[11:37:40] <unclemantis> looks like jquery is barking
[11:37:46] <tomasm-> unclemantis, the code is only like 50 lines long, probably easiest to poke around and figure it out in there, do some console.log() stuff, etc
[11:37:52] <kborchers> raiun: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[11:37:59] <unclemantis> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (threshold) {
[11:38:03] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: one would think the naming was made deliberately, no reason for jQuery to try to be smart about that
[11:38:11] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: they weren't then someone pointed out that the html5 standard said they should so they did
[11:38:31] <unclemantis> i am going to break this down and just keep adding stuff
[11:38:31] <raiun> thats not quite what im looking for
[11:38:36] <raiun> i dont need autocomplete on the form
[11:38:38] <raiun> well i might later
[11:38:38] <raiun> but
[11:38:41] <MoTiOnXml> html5 asks you to name data-<name> attributes and asks you to convert them to data<Name>?
[11:38:42] <raiun> im using the form as search
[11:38:59] <al3xnull_> Not sure if anyone answered before, got pulled into a meeting but I feel like I've done this before, but for some reason, but when I put a remove statement in the slideUp callback, it's called immediately after mouseout.
[11:39:01] <raiun> and i want to populate the page with the search results based on whats in the textbox asynchronously
[11:39:06] <al3xnull_> https://gist.github.com/1178410
[11:39:10] <al3xnull_> Is this due to the fact that it's contained within a hover, or is there a better way to do what I'm trying to accomplish?
[11:39:19] <djQuery> raiun: still you can look through thier code and see what they are doing. think you would be better with .bind('keyup change')
[11:40:30] <raiun> forgive the noob question but, how do i do a callback function on that? i need something to happen when that changes
[11:40:46] <djQuery> al3xnull_: why add it and remove it every time they hover? why not just hide it?
[11:40:52] <kborchers> raiun: you can bind to the change event ... it's all in the docs
[11:41:00] <raiun> k
[11:41:22] <kborchers> on that link i gave you, go to the events tab and check out change
[11:41:45] <al3xnull_> djQuery: Suppose I could hide it. Issue currently is that slideDown forces content down and z-indexing it didn't seem to work for me. I may have done something wrong though.
[11:41:59] <al3xnull_> djQuery: Suppose I could hide it. Issue currently is that slideDown forces content down and z-indexing it didn't seem to work for me. I may have done something wrong though.
[11:42:00] <kborchers> raiun: though, for what you are doing, the search event might be better
[11:42:19] <raiun> ok ill look at both, the bind seems to be doing what i want it to do
[11:43:23] <jebaird> Any one know if its possible to have a jquery ui sortable trigger a droppable over event? use case 2 sortable connected on 2 different tabs when a sortable item is dragged over a tab, switch to that tabs content
[11:44:07] <kborchers> jebaird: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs
[11:44:42] <jebaird> kborchers I saw that but I don't want to have them drop the sortable item on the tab
[11:46:03] <al3xnull_> djQuery: I guess the morning coffee hadn't kicked in. I removed most of the code, set the z-index on campusMenu and it works as initially planned.
[11:46:11] <al3xnull_> djQuery: Thanks for looking though =]
[11:46:51] <unclemantis> apparently this plugin is broken
[11:47:04] <unclemantis> can you folks recommened any other plugins for rounded corners?
[11:47:19] <unclemantis> This one is being a jerk. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/borderStyle
[11:48:12] <kborchers> jebaird: have you tried setting the event: mouseover option in the tabs and then dragging over the tabs to see if they change?
[11:48:58] <MoTiOnXml> wow, the stuff @ http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-color-plugin-xcolor/ is really nice
[11:49:33] <jebaird> kborchers I have not, currently im not using the tabs widget. But that's a great idea
[11:49:54] <kborchers> jebaird: i have not done it but i think that should work
[11:53:22] <TheEmpath> hail jquerians
[11:53:30] <TheEmpath> so... jquery performance question!
[11:53:48] <TheEmpath> does setting a jqueryui to 'disabled' mean events are unbound?
[11:54:00] <TheEmpath> or are all listeners still in place, drinking precious CPU?
[11:54:13] <benanne> :p
[11:54:44] <timmywil> 1.6.3rc1 released http://blog.jquery.com/2011/08/29/jquery-1-6-3-rc1-released/
[11:55:02] <timmywil> TheEmpath: neither really. they are still bound, but do not require CPU
[11:55:06] <snover> THANKS TIMMY
[11:55:07] <TheEmpath> k
[11:55:32] <TheEmpath> timmywil: I got an html5 graphic engine, but im using jquery as the UI, and i've noticed that while i can get the graphic engine quick, jquery obliterates my cpu
[11:55:39] <StPiere> im trying to make simple slider : http://jsfiddle.net/kaigan/qr2BJ/ but when clicked << or >> it moves scattered ..
[11:55:48] <TheEmpath> so i'm putting a UI wrapper layer above it to automatically optimize jquery as best i can
[11:56:29] <timmywil> snover: ha, np
[11:56:38] <TheEmpath> removing one-off dialogs from the dom, using selectors once on initialization then caching the results, disabling components that aren't active, etc.
[11:57:01] <TheEmpath> unbinding event listeners when i don't need then... just trying to preserve as much cpu as possible
[11:58:21] <johnkpaul> Does anyone knoe where I can get the video of the talk that goes with these slides? http://jquerysbestfriends.com/
[11:58:25] <timmywil> TheEmpath: hard to say without seeing it. If you post an example, I'm sure someone can help.  Unfortunately, I'm quite busy atm.
[11:58:36] <TheEmpath> timmywil: indeed sir
[11:59:50] <jvm_> hi. how can i do something like $("span").each(function () { alert($(this+" input").val()); }); now the $(this+" input") is obviously stupid. what's the proper way?
[12:01:27] <kborchers> jvm_: $(this).find("input")... or if they are immediate child nodes and you don't want deeper inputs, it would be better to do $(this).children("input")...
[12:02:10] <jvm_> kborchers, thanks a lot! have a good day. (jquery is wonderful.)
[12:02:16] <kborchers> np
[12:09:04] <unclemantis> found one that works. thanks guys

[12:15:07] <Getty> Can i detect if the user has some "dragable" item in hand while he hovers over my element? so like that i have a .hover on my element and inside of that i want to have different effects depending if the user has a draggable "in hand" or not
[12:20:13] <eago> hi, if I'm using getJson to load data, and I need to stop that loading to load something else how I do it
[12:20:35] <eago> like, if I have a calendar and I'm loading a month's data but user changes the month before the data finnishes loading
[12:32:53] <euge> heya, anyone mind taking a look at this jsfiddle let me know if its a bug or impropper usage. http://jsfiddle.net/JRU5x/ thanks!
[12:38:15] <bassan> hi
[12:38:28] <sphinxxx> any wyay to autocomplete, based on data from a google spreadsheet?
[12:39:25] <IgnisDiabolus> zup guys
[12:39:43] <IgnisDiabolus> somebody point me to working offline with jQuery/javascript?
[12:40:07] <IgnisDiabolus> s/point me to/point me to a tutorial about
[13:04:32] <johnkpaul> IgnisDiabolus: that's mroe of an HTML5 question rather than a jquery question, but here's the go to starter guide for this
[13:04:33] <johnkpaul> http://diveintohtml5.org/offline.html
[13:05:23] <IgnisDiabolus> crap! thought so. what's all these tuts I found on the web about working on ff3.6+ versions though? heh
[13:06:23] <totallyvinny> i have some code that will remove attr disabled on keypress but it removes the attribute to all the submit buttons how do i make it not do that ha
[13:06:29] <totallyvinny> here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/wKUBM/
[13:09:02] <ThePendulum> Let me see totallyvinny
[13:09:59] <IgnisDiabolus> $(this).parent().find('input[type="submit"]').removeAttr('disabled'); think so
[13:10:06] <ThePendulum> Well, set an ID to the input you'd like to remove the attribute from, and just use the function on that particular ID
[13:10:16] <ikla> is it possible to grab a option that is a value of 0 and move it to the top of the select drop down list with jquery?
[13:11:45] <kborchers> ikla: $("option[value='0']").prependTo("select"); obviously the option and select might need to be a little more specific but that's the idea
[13:11:53] <totallyvinny> IgnisDiabolus: thank you!
[13:12:00] <totallyvinny> that did the trick
[13:12:10] <totallyvinny> i would set an id but i will be having multiple forms on the page
[13:12:20] <ikla> yeah cause one option is always at the bottom of every drop down in a dynamic page, I need it at the top of the list
[13:12:21] <ikla> kewl
[13:14:38] <IgnisDiabolus> totallyvinny, http://jsfiddle.net/Dbpzv/
[13:14:55] <RobW> anyone know of a good carousel for smart phones?
[13:15:07] <IgnisDiabolus> sencha touch :3
[13:18:36] <kanja1> is it possible to do a jsonp request with an anonymous function?
[13:18:45] <ikla> can I have jquery get all select dropdown name's and put it into an array?
[13:19:02] <ikla> nvrmind
[13:20:41] <IgnisDiabolus> ikla var somearray_var = []; $('select').each(function() { somearray_var.push($(this).attr('name')); } );
[13:21:01] <EyePulp> Yo ho ho
[13:21:45] <EyePulp> So I have a <span class='foo bar'>Yo!</span> and if I do $
[13:21:57] <RobW> anyone know of a good carousel for smart phones? I can't find anything about it on sencha
[13:22:06] <RobW> and their demos don't even work on my droid
[13:22:07] <RobW> err, evo
[13:22:09] <EyePulp> ahem - if I do $('.bar').length I'm getting 0 under IE8
[13:22:27] <IgnisDiabolus> http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/kitchensink/ > UI > carousel. sorry jQuery guys
[13:22:35] <Deafgoose> can anybody tell me why my select list items are not being serialized?
[13:22:36] <EyePulp> is there a secret to selecting by classnames for elements with multiple classes?
[13:22:36] <Deafgoose> http://jsfiddle.net/gasVk/
[13:23:38] <kborchers> EyePulp: have you tried any other browsers? If that gives you 0, then it doesn't exist.
[13:24:12] <RobW> IgnisDiabolus: yes but the swiping doesn't work on my evo
[13:24:22] <RobW> The carousel doesn't work.. I see the first slide but that's it :|
[13:24:32] <EyePulp> kborchers: it seemed to work under FF6 /OSX
[13:24:43] <kborchers> ?demo @ EyePulp
[13:24:44] <bot-t> EyePulp, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:24:48] <IgnisDiabolus> :3
[13:25:43] <EyePulp> kborchers: what you're saying is that there *shouldn't* be an issue with the approach I'm using?
[13:25:52] <kborchers> EyePulp: correct
[13:26:08] <johnkpaul> Deafgoose: what's the problem you're having?
[13:26:31] <EyePulp> kborchers: that's good enough for me to keep poking at it.  if I simplify enough to show a demo, I'll bug ya'll again. =)
[13:26:44] <Deafgoose> johnkpaul, never mind, I managed to fix it, somehow the select was not being serialized on the .submit()
[13:27:01] <Deafgoose> $("#update_site").click(function(){site_data = $("#main_form").serialize();}) above the .submit() fized it
[13:27:18] <johnkpaul> ah I see
[13:27:19] <johnkpaul> cool
[13:27:41] <Deafgoose> thanks anyways!
[13:28:32] <ikla> if I have the name of a select, how do I search for an option inside that select that has a value of 10 ?
[13:28:47] <johnkpaul> Deafgoose: I actually learned something new by reading your code, I didn't realize that $.post would switch to jsonp if it detected the parameter in the url string
[13:29:17] <Deafgoose> yea I got that from the comments section at the jquery site
[13:29:20] <graphikz> hey, any reason why http://68.192.139.56/#leasing - the accordion-style area fucks up only when you click the first item
[13:29:22] <Deafgoose> good tip though :)
[13:29:24] <graphikz> in IE
[13:30:22] <happy_> Howdy. I'm using appendTo to fix the problem of form fields in dialog boxes being moved out of the current object. The code I used I looked up in jquery docs but I still dont understand it. Can anyone briefly explain what this line does, please? http://pastebin.com/44MUxZbd
[13:32:20] <kborchers> happy_: that will take the parent element of james (including james and anything else inside of that parent) and move it to the bottom of the first form on the page
[13:34:01] * Techdeck pokes ajpiano for guidance
[13:34:01] <happy_> oh i see, thanks kborchers .. and is it possible to specify which form it appends it to by name? So instead of form:first I could use the ID of the form?I didtry but no such luck
[13:34:40] <kborchers> happy_: sure just replae "form:first" with "#idOfTheForm"
[13:34:44] <kborchers> replace*
[13:34:55] <happy_> oh, including the hash? That is what I missed before
[13:34:56] <happy_> many thanks
[13:35:00] <kborchers> np
[13:35:36] <happy_> ah, works perfectly. If only I'd ask here 3 hours ago ha :D

[13:47:34] <snover> peol: wat?
[13:48:11] <snover> an array isnâ€™t a string of html
[13:49:25] <peol> snover: saw, sorry, didn't look at it. thought he had a test case for the RC
[13:51:07] <kanja1> I have a request going from www.foo.com to bar.foo.com, and I've configured sessions such that logging in on any subdomain works across the whole domain. When making the request, I get a standard authentication dialog, despite that I'm logged in. I also can't authenticate despite having good creds. Any idea why that's happening?
[13:56:51] <snover> kanja1: how does that have anything at all to do with jquery?
[13:58:28] <StPiere> im using jquery-ui and have problem accessing images from css the structure is /css/jquery-ui.css   ans /css/images
[13:58:45] <kanja1> snover: Jquery is making the actual request - I think the root problem is that cookies aren't being included, and I'm not sure if that's because of a jquery issue or I'm doing something wrong to prevent them from being included
[13:59:09] <StPiere> any idea what could cause this issue? im using zend framework by the way , but i dont think its the problem
[14:04:32] <pachet> so.... lets say i'm loading js dynamically
[14:04:35] <pachet> via a load() or some such
[14:04:51] <pachet> the tag itself gets chomped up, and the src evaluated
[14:05:22] <pachet> what if i wanted to eval inline js within <script></script> too
[14:06:48] <pachet> all the hackarounds with appending eval($('script').eq($('script').length-1)) to catch the inline js wont work, because the tag isnt resident in the dom
[14:06:51] <pachet> ; /
[14:08:08] <a111> If i declare a function in the head of the page, can i call the function from the body of the page?
[14:08:38] <a111> or does the function need to be declared and called from within the same scrip tag
[14:09:08] <pachet> can call from anywhere given you havent isolated the function within a different scope
[14:09:14] <ThePendulum> Why would you create a function if you couldn't call it from somewhere lse?
[14:09:15] <ThePendulum> *else
[14:09:17] <pachet> eg if you bury the function in a jquery(document).ready
[14:09:34] <pachet> then it'll come back undefined if you try to call from another script

[14:18:53] <edektor> Im am having a problem with jquery-ui's tabs
[14:18:54] <edektor> http://pastie.org/2450942
[14:19:16] <edektor> That pasted code doesnt work
[14:19:53] <kborchers> edektor: that should just be $('#detailTabs').tabs();
[14:20:09] <edektor> and if I do just $('#detailsTabs).tabs(); it also targets the ul in the content panels
[14:20:32] <edektor> it think the ul in #overview are suppose to be tabs
[14:20:38] <edektor> as weel
[14:20:41] <edektor> well*
[14:22:31] <edektor> @kborchers Do you get what I mean?
[14:22:53] <kborchers> yeah, not sure but may be a bug ... investigating
[14:23:06] <edektor> okay. Cool thanks
[14:23:26] <edektor> I was working off of this tutorial if it matters
[14:23:26] <edektor> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/create-a-tabbed-interface-using-jquery/
[14:23:32] <kanja1> snover: I was under the impression that since my requests are under the same domian, and I'm setting my cookie as ".foo.com" I could expect the cookie to be included in the jsonp request
[14:24:04] <snover> you didnâ€™t say anything about jsonp
[14:24:50] <kanja1> snover: I guess I didn't - my bad. I thought it was implied since I was jumping domains.
[14:25:06] <kanja1> There's no other way to jump subdomains, is there?
[14:25:57] <snover> CORS. In any case cookies come with JSONP requests so you need to fix whatever is setting cookies.
[14:26:45] <kborchers> edektor: not a bug ... the source for UI Tabs specifically says to only transform the first UL into the tabs
[14:27:05] <Mindore> Hi there. I want to animate background-color with easing. Tried jQuery Color Animations plugin and it works with background-color. But when i try to add easing the background-color animation crashes even if i dont use easing on that animation using Jamie Lemons easing plugin... Using Jquery 1.3.2
[14:27:49] <Mindore> Is there any other plugins supporting both background-color and easing animations for jquery 1.3.2? :)
[14:29:16] <edektor1> @kborchers Okay
[14:29:18] <kanja1> snover: Rargh, I think CORS is what I'm looking for. Thanks
[14:29:18] <Iarfen> hi
[14:29:33] <edektor1> but what if I want my tabs at the bottom
[14:29:39] <edektor1> rather then the top
[14:30:06] <Iarfen> $(document).height() returns me a value higher than the value of the document height, why it's happening that?
[14:30:10] <edektor1> like this http://pastie.org/2450942
[14:51:20] <RobW> anyone know of a good carousel for smart phones?
[14:51:36] <RobW> Something to where you can drag your finger and the carousel moves with your finger?
[15:15:04] <oqkweoqwke> I like potatoes.
[15:16:25] <kitikonti> is there a shorter way to select the elemtns in the second line http://pastebin.com/vCxumWy5
[15:17:24] <RobW> $('#galery-slider-1').children("div.slide").width() maybe?
[15:19:04] <kitikonti> RobW: i dont want to use $('#galery-slider-1) because this will be later a variable of a function
[15:23:48] <trollboy> is there a official way to get the jquery? http://pastebin.com/D2G2CCSx <-- this works on firefox but not on my android

[15:25:29] <RobW> you mean location/
[15:25:40] <trollboy> yeah sorry
[15:25:44] <trollboy> the gps coords

[15:28:11] <RobW> oops
[15:28:18] <RobW> Have you tried latitude?
[15:29:21] <trollboy> RobW, what do you mean?
[15:29:26] <trollboy> a library called latitude?
[15:29:32] <RobW> google latitude api - not sure if it releases coords
[15:29:36] <RobW> maybe even check out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4661906/geolocation-through-androids-gps-provider-on-a-website
[15:29:57] <RobW> but they use the geolocation methods too
[15:30:48] <trollboy> yeah that stack overflow looks to be the same methods I'm using

[15:35:42] <draginx1> Anyway to get jquery-ui to revert: true only if the item is not contained within a certain element on a draggable?

[15:37:45] <draginx1> nvm figured it out
[15:38:38] <Segaja> hi, i have a number of divs with a class and i want to select the div which contains a visible img. how can i do that?
[15:42:44] <roshanpatel27> Hello, I started using the autocomplete plugin today to fetch data matching the value in the textfield to provide look-ahead functionality. It currently listens for a keypress event. Once one comes into existence, it executes an ajax call to one of my controllers which sends back a json object that is then parsed to construct the look-ahead functionality. However, the problem is it is slightly glitchy. Sometimes i have to insert
[15:42:44] <roshanpatel27> three characters or hit backspace before the look-ahead comes to existence.
[15:46:25] <draginx1> Segaja: $('div > img:visible') ?
[15:47:26] <DEac-> hi
[15:49:16] <roshanpatel27> hi :)
[15:50:16] <muzone> halles :-)
[15:50:39] <DEac-> i've a litte big problem: my code puts "hello world". i thought, only appended script will be executed, but it seems, that every script-node will be executed. code: $('<div>').html('<script>console.log("hello world")</script>')
[15:51:23] <DEac-> how i can add a script-element to a div-element without execution?
[16:00:36] <kelye> hello, i have a problem with the form plugin.. after an upgrade the file upload is not working anymore
[16:01:24] <kelye> the only thing that i'm getting in console is [jquery.form] state = loading , [jquery.form] isXml=false
[16:02:09] <mberkom> Posted an issue i've got on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7236870/make-plupload-play-nice-with-ajax-loaded-jquery-dialog
[16:02:19] <Segaja> draginx1: that gives me the img. not the div
[16:02:29] <draginx1> i thought u wanted the img
[16:02:32] <draginx1> just add .parent() to that
[16:02:56] <Segaja> i have $('.class img:visible') and i don't know how many levels are between the class and the img
[16:03:22] <draginx1> Im going to need sample data to help u out a bit more
[16:03:38] <Segaja> actually it doesn't matter. i solved the problem on some other way
[16:03:41] <draginx1> k

[16:14:09] <ELAD> hello
[16:14:27] <ELAD> i need help with jquery script
[16:15:37] <ELAD> someone can help me please?
[16:16:02] <bot-t> ELAD, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:16:40] <ELAD> ok
[16:18:52] <ELAD> i have a jquery script for fade effect on mouseover and i can't put more then one at the same html page cuz they have the same id, so i try to create more css id but only the first image works. here is the code:
[16:18:56] <ELAD> <script type='text/javascript' src="jquery.js"></script>
[16:19:26] <ELAD> i can't put it here
[16:19:44] <superjacaman> use class instead
[16:19:46] <coldhead> WAHOO LET ME HEAR YOU SAY PSCHAW IF YOU LOVE DUBSTEP!!
[16:19:46] <pachet> ^

[16:20:24] <ELAD> this is the script
[16:20:54] <savid> Hi, I've retreived a collection of elements using .parents(),   but it returns that collection in reverse.  Is there a way to reverse a collection of matched nodes?
[16:21:00] <ELAD> what do u mean class instead ??
[16:21:00] <enjoycrf> heyheyhey
[16:21:06] <enjoycrf> did i miss anything
[16:30:30] <aaairc> hey guys... i'm having a scroll bar issue in chrome, but not in Safari or Firefox on Mac. On my webpage, I have a div where I set the height and do overflow.y: auto. when i initially change up the content of the div with an ajax call... two scroll bars show up like this:  http://oi55.tinypic.com/2ziaq9u.jpg  and then if i scroll a little bit, one of the scroll bars disappears, leaving just one like this: http://oi51.tinypic.com/hx0uwm.j
[16:31:27] <aaairc> anyone know what could be causing this... and what i could do to fix it so just the one scrollbar appears... and in the right position, so the scrollbar that dissappears after i do a little scrolling?
[16:39:16] <pachet> savid: js arrays have a reverse method
[16:39:44] <savid> pachet, yep, that's what I ended up using.   Actually,  I did    $.fn.reverse=[].reverse  :)
[16:40:01] <savid> So I could do  $('foo').parents('bar').reverse()
[16:40:13] <pachet> slick :D
[16:40:36] <savid> yeah, I was actually kinda shocked that it worked :-P
[17:02:41] <geekbuntu> is there a 'more secure' way to submit user/pass via jquery?
[17:02:58] <geekbuntu> (besides using stunnel or ssl)
[17:03:11] <savid> geekbuntu,  I read a good article on that recently
[17:03:26] <geekbuntu> cool
[17:03:52] <savid> http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/
[17:04:01] <geekbuntu> cool - thanks
[17:04:30] <savid> the article seems to suggest that no, there's really no truly secure way
[17:05:25] <coldhead> encyrption is hard
[17:07:58] <geekbuntu> savid, you're right - ironically they susggest python (what i normally work in)
[17:08:10] <geekbuntu> but with ajax - can't be that picky
[17:08:20] <savid> python ftw
[17:08:46] <sorush20> hi  I have a site www.sorushnazari.com/quickContact.php I want the animate function to be replaced with the slide down ... can someone show me how?
[17:11:07] <enjoycrf> some1 asked me to convert python to php
[17:11:09] <enjoycrf> haha
[17:11:32] <enjoycrf> i guess php is better
[17:12:12] <ofsemisanddinos> i think it's just a bit more accessible to people (i.e. myself)
[17:12:32] <ofsemisanddinos> like, i would have no idea how to start a webapp with python â€”Â makes me feel like an idiot
[17:13:06] <ofsemisanddinos> from everything i hear, python can be way more secure
[17:13:11] <ofsemisanddinos> sorry, o/t
[17:15:40] <enjoycrf> python is for advanced modules
[17:16:33] <ofsemisanddinos> which means what?
[17:16:38] <bitwise_> is there a better way of preventing a link from going to the specified href besides e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); inside the handler func?
[17:18:02] <enjoycrf> bye my javascriptting friends
[17:18:06] <enjoycrf> tata
[17:18:08] <enjoycrf> lol
[17:21:10] <skypce> hi can you helpme please a need add the opcion "Select country" to a select with jquery
[17:21:21] <pomke> Hello, I have a ui that has two horizontally scrolled divs containing divs which are sortable using the jqueryui sortable tool (here is a screenshot) http://pangur.com.au/project-structure-tool.png the gray boxes are connected sortables, which works fine, I can drag them around just fine, but I want to be able to drag outside of the scrollable container to those boxes below that say My Stash/ Trash, but this just scrolls the top container vertically, I've 
[17:29:08] <Woosta> Does anyone know of a plugin that turns a select with <optgroup>s into a hierarchal menu?
[17:31:12] <skypce> what is wrong with this , $('#edit-city').append('<option value="0" selected="selected">Choose City</option>'); please?
[17:31:50] <ryanf> if I'm writing a callback for a click event, is there some way to access the dom element that "this" is pointing to without actually referring to "this"?
[17:32:02] <ryanf> I tried e.target, but it turns out that has somewhat different semantics
[17:32:49] <coldhead> skypce: looks okay to me, what's not working?
[17:32:57] <coldhead> can you try pasting your test case on jsfiddle?
[17:33:07] <coldhead> ryanf: any good reason not to use this?
[17:33:12] <coldhead> that's what it's there for :\
[17:33:27] <ajpiano> ryanf: what do you mean, "different semantics"
[17:33:30] <ajpiano> this === e.target
[17:33:32] <ryanf> yeah, I want to bind the callback with coffeescript's fat arrow, which throws out the provided this
[17:33:41] <ajpiano> then $(e.target) should do the thing
[17:33:46] <ryanf> ajpiano: if you do element.click(), this is the element that the callback is bound to
[17:33:47] <coldhead> oh coffeescript
[17:33:49] <ajpiano> i do $(e.target) all the fing time
[17:33:51] <coldhead> WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN
[17:33:53] <ryanf> oh sorry let me revise that
[17:33:59] <ryanf> this is always the element the callback is bound to
[17:34:04] <ryanf> but e.target is the thing that was actually clicked
[17:34:12] <ajpiano> ryanf: i'm abundantly aware of this
[17:34:15] <ajpiano> fact*
[17:34:22] <ryanf> then why are you acting like they're the same?
[17:34:23] <ryanf> they're not.
[17:34:24] <skypce> coldhead , i need a placeholder in the select that say "choose city" how can i do it please?
[17:34:27] <ajpiano> oh right
[17:34:29] <ajpiano> derp
[17:34:39] <ajpiano> ryanf: what i'm saying is, $(e.target) should work just fine
[17:34:44] <coldhead> ?p @ skypce
[17:34:44] <bot-t> skypce, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:34:59] <coldhead> if you get it up on jsfiddle we can get it working for you, skypce
[17:35:05] <ryanf> it doesn't. in this case, the binding is on a div that contains a link. if I click the link, this is the container and e.target is the link
[17:35:12] <coldhead> but from what i've seen so far that should Just Work and Case Closed
[17:35:45] <ajpiano> ryanf: are you using coffeescript and no backbone?
[17:35:58] <ryanf> yes
[17:36:01] <ajpiano> int.
[17:36:02] <Kamakazi> DAMN YOU GOOGLE CHROME, WHY IS YOUR USER AGENT STYLESHEET OVERRIDING MINE ON THIS PAGE!!!!!!!
[17:36:20] * Kamakazi is done venting
[17:36:24] <ajpiano> ryanf: console.dir( e );
[17:36:29] <ajpiano> check some of the other event properties
[17:36:32] <ajpiano> event.currentTarget etc
[17:36:36] <ryanf> anyway I can just not use the fat arrow if there is no decent way of doing this
[17:36:46] <ryanf> oh good call, that was how I found e.target but I kind of stopped looking after that
[17:36:52] <ryanf> I'll poke around a bit more
[17:37:16] <ajpiano> allz i'm sayin is i use _.bind or some other facsimile all the time and use e.target with no trouble
[17:37:52] <ryanf> it normally wouldn't matter, if you're binding directly on the thing being clicked. it's only an issue if you let the event bubble up
[17:37:58] <ryanf> I think
[17:38:05] <ajpiano> but yeah, it could possibly get hairy depending on exactly how you're binding and catching your events
[17:38:05] <ajpiano> yah
[17:38:26] <ajpiano> the fat arrow is the only thing that makes me want to use coffeescript :x
[17:38:43] <ajpiano> not that other things don't, that's just one i'm like <3
[17:38:43] <ryanf> oh durr, I'm pretty sure it's currentTarget
[17:38:48] <ryanf> yeah, it's really nice sugar
[17:38:54] <ryanf> especially combined with @
[17:38:58] <ryanf> makes OO so much less noisy
[17:39:22] <ajpiano> yea
[17:39:37] <ajpiano> i can see the appeal
[17:41:19] <pomke> Is anyone able to help with some questions about jqueryui sortable?
[17:45:35] <Z3R0> Anyone know how I can get tablesorter to work with dynamic data?
[17:46:24] <ajpiano> Z3R0: i believe you do .trigger("update") on the table to cause it to reindex the data
[17:46:36] <ryanf> ajpiano: currentTarget works, thx
[17:46:46] <Z3R0> right, I knew that much, but how do I run the trigger on something after I parse html to it ?
[17:47:02] <Z3R0> I tried the trigger after creating the table, but didn't do anything
[17:47:06] <ajpiano> Z3R0: by doing exactly what you just said
[17:47:14] <ajpiano> add the html to the table and then triggering the update
[17:47:26] <Z3R0> hmmm let me check my code, maybe I did it wrong
[17:47:27] <ajpiano> if you are replacing the entire table, not just its contents, you can't do an update
[17:47:49] <Z3R0> right, table itself exists, just no data in it... I just have <table> </table> tags (with id's and class)
[17:50:01] <Z3R0> question then ajpiano
[17:50:19] <Z3R0> where do I put the actual tablesorter .tablesorter() ?
[17:50:27] <Z3R0> because it won't attach if it's not created
[17:50:46] <Z3R0> oh wait, nvm it is attaching, just not working cuz it's not finding data (nvm let me try that update again
[17:50:47] <ajpiano> presumably you'd do that after there was some data in the table
[17:50:53] <ajpiano> yeah
[17:51:44] <coldhead> skypce: http://jsfiddle.net/adv4N/
[17:53:23] <skypce> thank you coldhead
[17:53:24] <Z3R0> hmm not working
[17:53:29] <Z3R0> $('#tp_table').html(data['table']).trigger('update');
[17:53:43] <skypce> coldhead the problem is that choose option appear in the list
[17:53:44] <skypce> :S
[17:53:51] <Z3R0> loads the table as it should but still doesn't sort
[17:53:55] <skypce> i need that choose option will be invisible
[17:54:53] <coldhead> i don't understand skypce. this? http://jsfiddle.net/adv4N/1/
[17:55:00] <Z3R0> got it thanks ajpiano
[17:55:08] <Z3R0> added the .tablesorter after the .trigger('update')
[17:55:18] <hbastidas> $(document).ready(function(){alert("hello world");})
[17:55:47] <Z3R0> uh hbastidas  what's that for ? lol
[17:55:54] <ajpiano> Z3R0: just make sure you aren't init'ing tablesorter over and over again
[17:55:57] <skypce> thank you in advance coldhead
[17:56:15] <Z3R0> O.o what do you mean ?
[17:56:40] <ajpiano> what i said
[17:56:48] <ajpiano> don't just unconditionally call tablesorter() every time you load data in
[17:56:53] <Z3R0> ah
[17:57:16] <Z3R0> how would I go around that then ?
[17:58:00] <ajpiano> unconditionally being the bad thing, doing it conditionally would probably what you want to do
[17:58:09] <Z3R0> right, but how could I do that then ?
[17:58:23] <Z3R0> I tried having it without being appended after the trigger() but it wouldn't attach
[17:58:58] <ajpiano> you can just set some kind of flag
[17:59:02] <ajpiano> the first time you do it
[17:59:12] <ajpiano> and then check for the existence of it later on
[17:59:50] <Z3R0> any idea how I could do something like that? just a global var check?
[18:01:37] <ajpiano> i have a lot of ideas but i'm somewhat inclined to let you try this out a bit on your own ;)
[18:02:07] <ajpiano> you could certainly use .data() as well
[18:02:11] <Z3R0> well I mean, I could do it easily with a global var, but I think it's best practice to limit the use of those
[18:02:23] <Z3R0> let me take a look into .data() and get back to you
[18:02:51] <ajpiano> yes but there a million places to have a variable where you can access it from multiple scopes where it isn't a global
[18:03:11] <ajpiano> the whole thing about nesting functions etc that we were talking about the other day
[18:03:26] <Z3R0> oh wow
[18:03:36] <Z3R0> data lets you attach ANYTHING custom ?
[18:03:47] <ajpiano> yea
[18:03:51] <Z3R0> that's sexy
[18:04:00] <Z3R0> and as long as the page itself doesn't refresh that data is stored
[18:04:54] <ajpiano> yes
[18:07:22] <sunscreen> any one familiar with the dojo api?
[18:08:12] <coldhead> snover and rmurphey are
[18:08:16] <snover> thanks coldhead.
[18:08:19] <coldhead> and the guys in #dojo are especially
[18:08:29] <coldhead> snover: always a pleasure
[18:08:51] <snover> sunscreen: the solution to â€œIâ€™m not getting an answer fast enough for my likingâ€ is not â€œletâ€™s ask unrelated channelsâ€ :)
[18:09:11] <Z3R0> aj
[18:09:19] <Z3R0> is there anyway to do an inline .if() or something ?
[18:09:20] <sunscreen> well i asked i solved 1 less trivial problem my self.. but all i want to do is add a label to my analoggauge
[18:09:50] <ajpiano> Z3R0: not in a jquery chain, unless you want to use a plugin that does it
[18:09:54] <ajpiano> there are a few but the semantics are weird
[18:10:11] <Z3R0> hmmm
[18:10:28] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman jquery iff plugin
[18:10:29] <bot-t> ajpiano, Ben Alman » jQuery iff: A chainable "if" statement - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-iff-plugin/
[18:10:54] <coldhead> that's one of the best plugins ever
[18:13:40] <Z3R0> well I doubt this is the best method to do this, but I will show you what I got... don't really know how to test whether or not it's re-triggering
[18:14:08] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/cwrvU/
[18:14:29] <Z3R0> that wouldn't even work... dammit lol
[18:14:51] <ajpiano> you're getting closer
[18:14:57] <ajpiano> you don't need to query the dom like 3 times :/
[18:15:30] <Z3R0> o.o
[18:15:33] <Z3R0> thank god
[18:15:38] <Z3R0> and I moved the data()
[18:15:44] <Z3R0> put it after the the update
[18:15:53] <Z3R0> I mean, after the tablesorter() funciton
[18:16:30] <ajpiano> Z3R0: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/cwrvU/1/
[18:16:33] <Z3R0> hmmm
[18:16:37] <Z3R0> wait before I look at that
[18:16:48] <Z3R0> is the element - (this) still refer to the table since it hasn't changed selectors?
[18:17:11] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what you're asking
[18:17:20] <Z3R0> let me look and see what you did
[18:17:22] <ajpiano> "the table changing selectors" makes me queasy
[18:17:42] <Z3R0> dammit
[18:17:46] <Z3R0> why didn't I think of that?
[18:17:54] <ajpiano> you almost did
[18:17:59] <ajpiano> :p
[18:18:00] <Z3R0> storing the element as a var, and refer to the var
[18:18:19] <ajpiano> ?caching
[18:18:20] <bot-t> Even when you're creating a jQuery object out of an element you'll just be using once, you should always cache. Otherwhise you won't end up in heaven. http://blog.seankoole.com/qotd-why-should-you-cache-when-using-jquery
[18:18:49] <Z3R0> so even though it's a var, it's not pulling the value again because it's cached the entire object in the var?
[18:19:12] <ajpiano> if by "pulling the value" you mean "querying the DOM," then yes
[18:19:18] <Z3R0> yes that's what I meant
[18:19:22] <ajpiano> sweet
[18:19:29] <Z3R0> that's neato
[18:19:49] <ajpiano> there's an old saying that i just made up
[18:19:51] <ajpiano> it goes
[18:20:01] <ajpiano> "don't be unbeariable, use a variable"
[18:20:09] <Z3R0> lol
[18:20:14] <ajpiano> coldhead: your reflections are appreciated on the abov ^^
[18:21:50] <rfw> hi there, i was wondering if there's a way in jquery to split a node into two
[18:21:56] <coreyo> http://jsfiddle.net/7vvvU/  I need a quick answer.  I'm trying to prevent an onClick checkbox event from firing its container onClick event, but I can't seem to do it without losing the ability to toggle the checkbox.  This is a simple example.
[18:22:10] <rfw> as in, i want to take a text node and split it into two parts all the way up to some ancestor node
[18:23:10] <rfw> http://pastie.org/2451979 something like this
[18:24:10] <ajpiano> coreyo: don't use attr, use prop
[18:24:14] <ajpiano> if you're using 1.6.2 in your app
[18:24:40] <ajpiano> you might also want to use event.stopPropagation() instead of return false
[18:24:46] <ajpiano> ?g stop misusing return false
[18:24:47] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery Events: Stop (Mis)Using Return False | Fuel Your Coding - http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[18:26:37] <coreyo> ajpiano, whether I use prop or attr, the state of the checkbox still seems to be reset when "false" is returned.  Is there another way to keep the parent container from receiving the onClick event?
[18:26:49] <ajpiano> coreyo, yes using event.stopPropagation
[18:26:55] <ajpiano> i wasn't just talking to the air ;)
[18:27:18] <coreyo> ajpiano, ahhh, my apologies ajpiano .  I totally mised that between your other replies
[18:28:11] <ajpiano> np
[18:28:28] <coreyo> and that is a nice link, thank you
[18:32:25] <Z3R0> thanks alot for that code ajpiano  is there any method of testing if it's working?
[18:32:45] <ajpiano> the fact that tablesorter works like normal :)
[18:33:10] <Z3R0> hmmm
[18:33:12] <Z3R0> except it doens't
[18:33:18] <Z3R0> tablesorter is no longer functioning
[18:33:29] <Z3R0> I still need the update that's why
[18:33:44] <ajpiano> ah
[18:33:45] <Z3R0> has to update in both places regardless
[18:33:52] <Z3R0> so I'll just put it above after the html() load
[18:34:26] <coreyo> ajpiano, plugged it into my code, and it works like a charm.  That solves 20 minutes of frustration.  Thank you very much.
[18:34:27] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/b65S5/ // should do the trick right ?
[18:35:04] <ajpiano> now you're never setting the data
[18:35:07] <ajpiano> thta it loaded
[18:35:19] <ajpiano> lol, neither was i :///
[18:35:26] <Z3R0> you didn't have tha tin there, one sec
[18:35:42] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/b65S5/1/
[18:35:50] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/b65S5/2/
[18:36:04] <Z3R0> lol I just chained it
[18:36:14] <Z3R0> does chaining matter if it's cached?
[18:36:16] <ajpiano> yea you could do that
[18:36:20] <ajpiano> same diff
[18:36:25] <Z3R0> is it ?
[18:36:31] <ajpiano> pretttttttty much
[18:36:34] <Z3R0> lol
[18:37:33] <Z3R0> now for the ultimate test... lol
[18:37:49] <Z3R0> nope lol
[18:37:51] <Z3R0> dang it
[18:39:05] <Z3R0> hmmm odd
[18:39:15] <Z3R0> I added an alert('ran'); and it's running on every load
[18:39:58] <ajpiano> you gotta set yo self some breakpoints and inspect yo self some variables
[18:40:43] <Z3R0> well I only have 1 variable and that's the custom .data()
[18:41:34] <ajpiano> yeah but like you can pause, you can find out the value of arbitrary expressions etc
[18:41:38] <Z3R0> ah found it
[18:41:43] <Z3R0> look at .data()
[18:41:45] <ajpiano> look at the code in detail and see....
[18:41:49] <Z3R0> doesn't work with .data('key')
[18:41:55] <ajpiano> yes it does
[18:41:56] <Z3R0> works on data('element','key')
[18:42:00] <Z3R0> or data('element')
[18:42:00] <ajpiano> there are two apis for data bro
[18:42:04] <Z3R0> O.o
[18:42:25] <ajpiano> one is $.data(DOMElement, key, value) the other is $(domelement).data(key, value);
[18:42:35] <ajpiano> don't mush them together
[18:42:38] <Z3R0> ah found it
[18:42:52] <Z3R0> one's the $.data() one's $('element').data()
[18:43:40] <Z3R0> ah that's probably what I did wrong then
[18:43:49] <Z3R0> I did .data(table,'loaded',true)
[18:43:58] <Z3R0> which is the wrong setup for a .data()
[18:44:17] <ajpiano> oh
[18:44:22] <Z3R0> that was my bad
[18:44:39] <Z3R0> no longer double triggering
[18:47:46] <Z3R0> thanks ajpiano  you've saved my ass was up all night trying to figure that one out
[18:47:50] <Z3R0> didn't thnk about a check var
[18:47:59] <ajpiano> yeah now you know how to set a flag
[18:48:06] <ajpiano> +1 programming points
[18:48:10] <Z3R0> and always better to var
[18:48:15] <ajpiano> +9001
[18:48:56] <Z3R0> lol
[19:00:54] <Z3R0> ugh i hate hotel wireless
[19:02:29] <Z3R0> lobby works fast apparently lol
[19:09:15] <Z3R0> whew all fixed lol
[19:12:44] <Z3R0> ack ajpiano problem with the script... on reload it no longer sorts the table O.o
[19:13:04] <ajpiano> i think you need to do .trigger("update").trigger("sort") or something like that
[19:13:06] <ajpiano> check the docs
[19:13:17] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[19:14:35] <Z3R0> http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-ajax.html according to that, we shouldn't have to...
[19:16:48] <Z3R0> but that already had data in it...
[19:16:53] <Z3R0> oh wait... I wonder
[19:17:02] <Z3R0> I bet I know why my original tag wasn't working
[19:17:28] <Z3R0> sortList: [[0,1]] // can't put a sort list inside the initial setup because there are no columns
[19:17:51] <Z3R0> I need to put that as a 'sorton' inside my append
[19:20:14] <Z3R0> nope that failed lol
[19:22:22] <r1ch> hi

[19:32:04] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:36:48] <Morbus> g'day. i'm a js newb.
[19:37:01] <coldhead> me too, Morbus!
[19:37:06] <Morbus> i'm using http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ to do a simple show/hide of a div when a span is clicked.
[19:37:09] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[19:37:16] <Morbus> i'd like to change the value of the span from "show" to "hide" as needed, etc.
[19:37:21] <Morbus> but, not entirely sure how to do that.
[19:39:42] <abjorn> coldhead is such a noob it hurts sometimes
[19:39:48] <abjorn> i just get so mad at his noobness
[19:39:52] <abjorn> seriously, what a nooblord
[19:40:15] <sunscreen> is there a hack / work around i can do to find the first SVG in a given <div> and then append a bit of html bellow it?
[19:41:17] <sunscreen> the SVG has no id
[19:41:22] <r1ch> is anyones got a free minute could they have a quick glance over this please: http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/javascript-15/jquery-ajax-call-preventing-jquery-ui-combobox-select-firing-779522.html
[19:43:12] <coldhead> Morbus: http://jsfiddle.net/suMp9/
[19:43:18] <coldhead> that seems to work
[19:43:50] <Morbus> yeah, http://jsfiddle.net/suMp9/1/ is what i'm using now.
[19:44:04] <Morbus> or rather, in the process of testing.
[19:44:14] <coldhead> i like that much less
[19:44:16] <coldhead> :D
[19:44:25] <Morbus> how so?
[19:45:12] <conee> is there any event to detect when a radio button loses checked status?  i have some selects / inputs that are tied to radio buttons, and i'm using the radio buttons to disable / enable the selects / inputs.
[19:45:24] <conee> change only fires when a radio is selected
[19:45:35] <coldhead> i think if there's only two states it's better to have all your shiz in the HTML and control it with the CSS, rather than involve your JS in the actual wording
[19:45:56] <conee> is there anything that fires when a radio transitions from selected to unselected?
[19:46:01] <coldhead> if a designer wants to change it later it's better to limit their damage to the HTML
[19:46:07] <coldhead> not that all designers are stupid
[19:46:20] <coldhead> but most designers are not to be trusted
[19:46:35] <Morbus> oh, yeah.
[19:46:37] <Morbus> i hear and agree.
[19:46:39] <Morbus> not plausible here though.
[19:46:43] <Morbus> or, rather, not a concern here.
[19:46:48] <coldhead> well whatever works :)
[19:46:48] <Morbus> just a quick hack
[19:56:27] <Z3R0> alright ajpiano check this out... http://jsfiddle.net/b65S5/9/  http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-empty-table.html
[19:57:51] <Z3R0> I have tried everything I can think of... but it looks like if I replace the thead and tbody sections it does not like it
[20:09:25] <abjorn> http://hostchopper.com/
[20:10:13] <Z3R0> ajpiano:  any thoughts?
[20:17:21] <coldhead> DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY LUNCH SUGGESTIONS
[20:17:23] <coldhead> PLEASE GOD
[20:17:37] <glaksmono> does anyone know why i couldn't send ajax request to https?

[20:17:51] <glaksmono> it says 200 OK, but it shows as red and doesn't return any value
[20:18:29] <xtc> coldhead what's the issue?
[20:18:54] <coldhead> glaksmono: are you trying to talk to https from http?
[20:19:09] <coldhead> because you can't do that
[20:19:21] <coldhead> xtc: i am just seeking advice
[20:20:15] <coldhead> abjorn: this is too intense :)
[20:20:15] <Woosta> coldhead: Thai
[20:21:25] <abjorn> not intense enough
[20:21:30] <abjorn> lol it was passed around work today
[20:21:37] <abjorn> im not sure where it came from
[20:21:41] <IgnisDiabolus> i like japanese. the way they scream. omg
[20:22:59] <coldhead> i think i have that scheduled for dinner, Woosta
[20:23:08] <glaksmono> coldhead: hmm... i'm trying to encrypt the username and password that's being sent
[20:23:13] <glaksmono> coldhead: any idea how to do that using SSL?
[20:23:20] <coldhead> the correct answer may well be mexican
[20:23:29] <coldhead> glaksmono: you have to do SSL ALL THE WAY
[20:23:39] <coldhead> you can't just send some data via SSL
[20:24:06] <coldhead> you could encrypt in the browser and decrypt on the server
[20:24:07] <IgnisDiabolus> chinese. yum
[20:24:10] <coldhead> that's a hot issue lately
[20:24:15] <coldhead> but not very secure
[20:27:09] <IgnisDiabolus> wow. e.preventDefault() doesn't work on chrome

[20:27:26] <abjorn> https://twitter.com/#!/hostchopper/status/104276902763700224
[20:27:28] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from hostchopper: NOSQL IS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE! #FUCKORACLE â˜… http://bit.ly/qijind
[20:27:28] <coldhead> surely that's not so IgnisDiabolus
[20:29:04] <letterpress> just want to check, coldheadâ€¦you can access https from http if the server allows the origin, right? or is that not the issue?
[20:32:13] <IgnisDiabolus> ah crap. it's because my submit button is hidden
[20:32:43] <coldhead> letterpress: no, as far as i know the browser won't let you
[20:32:48] <coldhead> you can't cross the streams
[20:32:54] <coldhead> this isn't ghostbuster :(
[20:33:48] <letterpress> this is a unique issue with https requests?
[20:34:09] <coldhead> it's the same origin policy
[20:34:20] <coldhead> requires the same domain, port and protocol
[20:34:23] <coldhead> CASE CLOSED
[20:34:36] <abjorn> so, no, not unique with https
[20:34:40] <abjorn> counts for http too
[20:34:50] <letterpress> yeah well, i can get cross domain requests to work with ajax by sending the right response headers
[20:35:02] <abjorn> not every time
[20:35:12] <abjorn> depends on the receiving server
[20:35:22] <abjorn> If you operate both ends then sure
[20:35:41] <letterpress> does it depend on the browser? that may be true b/c i've only had ff and chrome clients.
[20:36:15] <Z3R0> Anyone got ideas? Trying to dynamically populate thead and tbody (tablesorter) apparently doesn't like the thead and tbody sections not pre-existing...  http://jsfiddle.net/b65S5/9/  http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-empty-table.html
[20:36:36] <Z3R0> er, sorry (thead and tbody sections being re-created)
[20:36:39] <letterpress> i am operating the server yes
[20:36:48] <coldhead> if my browser did cross domain or cross protocol ajax without my permission i'd  be very upset
[20:37:02] <abjorn> ^
[20:37:14] <letterpress> what browser do you use coldhead?
[20:37:21] <abjorn> There are methods for cross-domain ajax, what exactly were you using?
[20:37:28] <abjorn> There's a lot of methods actually...
[20:37:46] <IgnisDiabolus> i forgot about .submit() lol. my bad
[20:37:52] <coldhead> w3-mode in emacs, letterpress
[20:37:52] <abjorn> :D
[20:38:00] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[20:38:07] <abjorn> chrome baby, chrome
[20:38:19] <letterpress> haha
[20:38:42] <letterpress> ok well not sure the NAME name, but i use Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers from the server
[20:39:01] <letterpress> but yeah, chrome allows this without prompting or anything
[20:40:14] <letterpress> ala https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Server-Side_Access_Control
[20:42:29] <letterpress> i guess this isn't supported by MSIE, judging from a  quick google search. fortunately my application doesn't need to worry about those users.
[20:42:43] <abjorn> lol
[20:42:46] <abjorn> "fuck those guys"
[20:42:48] <letterpress> or the emacs users.
[20:43:14] <abjorn> hey now
[20:43:18] <abjorn> that's coldhead
[20:43:22] <abjorn> say "sorry" to coldhead
[20:43:27] <abjorn> jk i dont care, it's just coldhead
[20:44:26] <letterpress> coldhead's always welcome to stop by and visit our intranet, i guess he just won't get to enjoy our cross origin resources. sorry man.
[20:45:08] <abjorn> tbh I've never needed to to cross-origin

[21:00:30] <Z3R0_> madprops got sample?
[21:01:04] <fandio> So how do you guys deal with "dynamic forms'?
[21:01:06] <fandio> The best solution I could come up with was inserting new DOM elements using name-mangled element IDs via JS, iterating over them, and then serializing them for POSTing them over to the server. Which is crazy messy.
[21:01:08] <fandio> Any better ideas?
[21:02:17] <madprops> Z3R0_, im just saving the val() of a textarea into the database then i display it, everything is fine except the first line that gets idented for some reason
[21:03:07] <Z3R0_> maybe trim it? I think it puts a <p> tag around it because it's stored in the db as text I am assuming right?
[21:05:30] <madprops> Z3R0_, yep
[21:06:02] <Z3R0_> ya that's sql for you lol it does that itself when you retrieve data from "text" attributes lol
[21:10:14] <madprops> Z3R0_, hm doesn't appear to fix it
[21:10:22] <madprops> Z3R0_, trimming*
[21:10:52] <Z3R0_> O.O
[21:11:27] <Z3R0_> hmmmm... might actually put the <p>tags</p> in the data pull...
[21:11:48] <Z3R0_> if that's the case trimming won't fix it
[21:12:20] <Z3R0_> could attr a class that removes the first index of that ptag ^_^
[21:13:58] <chrislabeard> is it possible to add a class to a div based on the file extension of a link? I'm trying to add images for each file type.
[21:14:44] <Z3R0_> chrislabeard: don't see why not
[21:15:08] <chrislabeard> Z3R0_: do you know of any tutorials on how to do this?
[21:15:57] <chrislabeard> I guess I could use purely css
[21:17:09] <kborchers> chrislabeard: sure, assuming the link is in the div, just do something like $("a[href$='png']").closest("div").addClass("pngClass"); and so on for other file types. all depends on your html structure and that i'm understanding your question ;)
[21:17:31] <razzi> he could do that with css too
[21:17:31] <chrislabeard> kborchers: yeah that sounds great
[21:17:44] <chrislabeard> I guess the only advantage would be support for IE6?
[21:18:08] <chrislabeard> but who cares about IE6 anyways
[21:18:17] <kborchers> china?
[21:18:33] <fandio> kborchers: yep
[21:18:48] <chrislabeard> lol

[21:56:35] <Z3R0> Modified my request with 3 samples ... Anyone ? http://jsfiddle.net/EqszB/18/
[22:06:50] <coldhead> i can take a look in about 4 hours if you have no luck before then, Z3R0
[22:07:12] <Z3R0> I won't be around by then lol
[22:17:51] <letterpress> Z3RO i took a look at this early but i still don't understand, what isn't working right?
[22:18:53] <Z3R0> it's not that it's not working... it's just I'd rather not have to recall my .tablesorter() on the event of a THEAD change... just kinda seems repetitive...
[22:19:54] <Z3R0> especially once I have all my options for .tablesorter() setup
[22:25:54] <letterpress> don't know if you're able to do this with this plugin. i always have used datatables for this sort of thing and it's pretty easy to do what you're suggesting...
[22:26:14] <Z3R0> datatables?
[22:26:39] <letterpress> http://datatables.net
[22:26:46] <Z3R0> oh snap that looks bad ass
[22:27:09] <Z3R0> that kinda looks exactly what i'm looking for
[22:27:10] <Z3R0> lolz
[22:27:13] <letterpress> haha
[22:27:25] <letterpress> i almost mentioned it last night and i guess i should have
[22:27:27] <letterpress> sorry.
[22:27:37] <Z3R0> that looks very slick lol
[22:28:01] <letterpress> anyway, it'll probably take a little trial and error to get it set up, but it's very powerful
[22:28:40] <Z3R0> ya  looks well worth it
[22:29:07] <letterpress> hope that helps!
[22:29:15] <Z3R0> do you know if it can do like tables with tables?
[22:30:35] <letterpress> haha wat does that mean?
[22:30:58] <letterpress> i'm not sure i've ever done like tables with tables.
[22:30:58] <Z3R0> nvm this will work
[22:30:59] <Z3R0> http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/row_details.html
[22:31:22] <letterpress> great.
[22:31:47] <letterpress> here is an example of data inserted into the table without re-instantiating the datatable: http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/server_side/defer_loading.html
[22:31:49] <Z3R0> basically I wanted something like <td><table>Detailed Item Info</table></td> repeat*
[22:32:21] <Z3R0> ok
[22:32:24] <Z3R0> this is fucking sexy
[22:32:49] <coldhead> god bless you letterpress++
[22:32:56] <Z3R0> and I can dynamically modify headers?
[22:33:46] <letterpress> good question. i'm doing that now by replacing the datatable...
[22:34:05] <letterpress> but there may be a better way
[22:34:21] <Z3R0> ya I guess I need to figure out how to use it, and then move from there
[22:34:32] <Z3R0> but either way, this looks to be ALOT more promising and featured
[22:34:46] <letterpress> showing/hiding is easy
[22:34:56] <letterpress> cool. yeah i love this thing.
[22:37:52] <Z3R0> looks like they did it here
[22:37:52] <Z3R0> http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/ajax/null_data_source.html
[22:40:57] <Accelerator> Are there any tuts out there for making div content boxes with transitions? Basically, I have a content box in between my navigational menu and footer. When I click a link in the nav menu, the content box (and only the content box) makes a transition to a new page.
[22:41:08] <Accelerator> Or simply pulls data from a static html page.
[22:54:15] <coldhead> i'm listening to dev-o live
[22:54:18] <coldhead> who's with me?

[22:55:55] <dexter_e> How to get the whole document out of jQuery?
[22:56:05] <dexter_e> $('document') ?
[22:56:47] <dexter_e> or  how to write   window.document  to a string ?
[22:56:58] <dexter_e> window.document.toString()  returns null .
[22:57:52] <Z3R0> dexter_e: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982717/how-do-i-get-the-entire-pages-html-with-jquery ?
[23:00:20] <dexter_e> ZR30:  Thanks,  but that doesn't return the entire document
[23:00:45] <dexter_e> that returns the content of the html tag
[23:01:20] <coldhead> view-source and copy to clipboard?
[23:01:27] <coldhead> why do you want the whole page a string?
[23:01:43] <coldhead> $('body').html() ?
[23:01:58] <dexter_e> coldhead:  so I can use it as a template
[23:02:19] <dexter_e> and different templates have different document type definitions
[23:02:32] <dexter_e> This is all happening server-side by the way
[23:03:39] <coldhead> the closest i can get is var sillystring = $('html')[0].innerHTML;
[23:03:52] <coldhead> that loses the <html> and the doctype
[23:03:59] <dexter_e> yeah , me too
[23:04:14] <coldhead> it's not something jQuery bothers to excel at apparently
[23:04:33] <dexter_e> apparently
[23:04:43] <dexter_e> ok
[23:04:47] <dexter_e> well thats good to know
[23:04:59] <coldhead> A MAN IS REAL / NOT MADE OF STEEL

[23:05:16] <dexter_e> nice
[23:05:39] <dexter_e> you do server stuff coldhead ?
[23:07:24] <warmwater> how would i print out the entire dom of an html doc, so the live dom rather than the original one when the page loaded
[23:07:31] <warmwater> need to hunt down some error
[23:08:04] <gnarf> um
[23:08:06] <gnarf> wtf
[23:08:13] <gnarf> dexter_e / warmwater ?
[23:09:09] <warmwater> i'm sure jquery has a way to crawl an entire node tree, firing off callbacks like a normal parser does
[23:09:17] <dexter_e> warmwater: thats what I wanna do too!  :)
[23:09:24] <warmwater> haha funny
[23:09:40] <warmwater> i figure i'll just use the normal get child functions in the dom
[23:09:55] <warmwater> knock out some half assed pretty printer
[23:09:58] <dexter_e> Its looking like its only possible to get the $('html').html()
[23:10:02] <warmwater> i'm sure chrome has this functionality in it already
[23:10:08] <dexter_e> gnarf:  why the wtf ?
[23:10:11] <dexter_e> :)
[23:10:36] <fandio> So how do you guys deal with "dynamic forms'?
[23:10:39] <gnarf> like two people with the same question in 20 minutes
[23:10:52] <gnarf> crazy
[23:10:52] <fandio> The best solution I could come up with was inserting new DOM elements using name-mangled element IDs via JS, iterating over them, and then serializing them for POSTing them over to the server. Which is crazy messy.
[23:10:53] <warmwater> that's what the end of a shitty Tuesday does to a man
[23:10:58] <fandio> Any better ideas?
[23:11:02] <warmwater> makes him come home, open a bottle of whiskey, and decide to code some bs
[23:11:12] <dexter_e> hhhahahaha
[23:11:19] <gnarf> warmwater: i think ben_alman was working on a DOM node crawler , but what are you trying to do?
[23:11:25] <dexter_e> I'm using this for JSDOM server side
[23:11:32] <warmwater> just built myself a little debugging tool
[23:11:33] <dexter_e> I'm running jQuery on the server
[23:11:39] <warmwater> but i just realised chrome probably does it already
[23:11:44] <coldhead> ON PLANET EARTH
[23:11:58] <gnarf> fandio: use real <form> and <input> tags?
[23:12:13] <gnarf> and ?use .serialize() on the form
[23:12:26] <gnarf> ?.serialize()
[23:12:27] <bot-t1> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[23:13:16] <fandio> O.o
[23:13:22] <fandio> okay well that looks really fricking useful
[23:13:44] <fandio> but that takes care of transport, what about growing the form dynamically?
[23:13:52] <gnarf> add more <inputs> ?
[23:14:04] <gnarf> with names?
[23:17:52] <fandio> gnarf: well, the names would be the same
[23:17:58] <anli_> warmwater: With firebug, you can see which nodes the dom currently have
[23:18:34] <fandio> think a list of Menu items for a restaurant menu. you click to add more menu-item-slots to the form
[23:19:01] <fandio> don't I need to name mangle the IDs to prevent conflicts and stuff?
[23:19:28] <anli_> you probably dont need them at all?
[23:21:06] <fandio> anli_: well how does the backend make sense of it?
[23:21:48] <anli_> fandio: I should probably be more initiated when answering that, but a list of dynamically created id seems to be a mess
[23:21:54] <anli_> ids
[23:22:36] <anli_> Its a restaurant menu, right?
[23:22:49] <anli_> :)
[23:22:57] <fandio> anli_: that happens to be one use case, yeah
[23:23:04] <fandio> and yes, it's a *huge* mess
[23:23:07] <anli_> lets stay with that
[23:23:11] <anli_> Its a restaurant menu
[23:23:17] <anli_> So now you want to add something to it
[23:23:58] <anli_> Lets say you have an add button
[23:24:24] <anli_> That will popup a dialog that asks in which place you want to insert the item
[23:24:42] <anli_> The dialog has a selectbox with the titles from each menu item
[23:24:53] <anli_> Retrieved from the DOM
[23:25:29] <anli_> Every item has an ID that is the db id, I use attributes to convey that information
[23:25:40] <anli_> <div data-id="34">foo</div>
[23:25:57] <anli_> Does anything of this make sense?
[23:26:27] <fandio> somewhat, maybe I should clarify how it works now
[23:26:31] <anli_> yes
[23:27:07] <fandio> when you click the add button, jQuery basically just throws a lot of raw HTML into the DOM. Think hard-coded strings. Very nasty stuff.
[23:27:17] <anli_> oh
[23:27:22] <fandio> so the id is automatically incremented and decremented when adding or removing the element
[23:28:00] <fandio> oh, I see where we're getting off
[23:28:06] <fandio> this is a menu *creation* page :)
[23:28:11] <anli_> Why does the client side invent ids?
[23:28:14] <fandio> not one for selecting from a pre-existing menu
[23:28:17] <anli_> ok
[23:28:24] <anli_> Its not a big difference
[23:28:31] <anli_> If you want to add an item to an already existing menu or not
[23:28:32] <fandio> anli_: they're only used by JS to keep track of things
[23:28:45] <anli_> But js has all it needs without the id
[23:28:49] <fandio> i.e where to call $.after()
[23:28:53] <fandio> oh?
[23:29:07] <anli_> What are you using the id for?
[23:30:31] <anli_> I actually invented ids in an webpage I was doing once, the ids that comes from the db are positive so the items that isnt already in the db was given negative ids, starting with -1, then -2 and so on
[23:30:49] <anli_> When you save the structure, you reload the page
[23:31:04] <anli_> Then all ids are positive, because they all come from the db
[23:31:12] <fandio> the id never goes back to the database -- it's just used as part of the JS state to know where things should be appended to and removed
[23:31:20] <fandio> basically ways of working with the DOM
[23:31:21] <anli_> yeah
[23:31:45] <fandio> so yeah, the auto-inc ID is toally separate from these IDs
[23:31:53] <fandio> ..actually
[23:32:02] <fandio> that's not entriely true
[23:32:15] <anli_> The thing is that you dont need to use the id attribute
[23:32:18] <anli_> Maybe you dont?
[23:32:35] <fandio> when *editing* a menu with prepopulated data, the auto inc IDs are used to start off the jQ idea
[23:32:37] <fandio> ids*
[23:32:41] <fandio> anli_: how does that work?
[23:32:55] <anli_> How does what work?
[23:32:57] <rfw> quick query: i can't seem to be able to use replaceWith on a document that isn't the current document
[23:32:59] <rfw> see http://jsfiddle.net/XdV9T/
[23:33:07] <anli_> You can invent attributes that starts with data-
[23:33:11] <anli_> data-id="343"
[23:33:19] <rfw> is there any way to make this work with jquery?
[23:33:22] <anli_> Then you dont use the dreadful id attribute
[23:33:46] <rfw> or is my use case too obscure to support
[23:34:39] <anli_> rfw: maybe you should change <second> to second in line 3
[23:34:41] <rfw> oops, messed that code up
[23:34:49] <rfw> yes i just noticed
[23:35:07] <anli_> I did not know you could use your own element names
[23:35:12] <rfw> oh, it works fine, my bad
[23:35:19] <fandio> anli_: ah yeah, i didn't mean literally use the ID attirbute. (I do, but that's besides the point)
[23:35:27] <coldhead> my god, the things people are doing today
[23:35:39] <coldhead> these are truly the last days
[23:36:01] <coldhead> "how do i get the outerhtml of the non-current document as a string of XML"
[23:36:24] <fandio> i guess I just don't like the prospect of all this naming and raw HTML strings
[23:36:24] <anli_> :)
[23:36:51] <coldhead> "how do i get the outerhtml of the non-current document as a string of XML and how do i send it via SSL to a different port on a different domain. i am using IE 6"
[23:37:05] <anli_> It must all be html actually, I use var html ="<div>foo</div>"; var div = $(html); $('#goo').append(div); and stuff
[23:37:20] <rfw> odd though, for some reason it doesn't seem to work in my use case
[23:38:33] <anli_> coldhead has a point, the computer science of today is complicated driven
[23:38:51] <anli_> The more complicated, the more probable is it that we do it
[23:40:27] <coldhead> in many ways it's like that planet they just discovered which is made of PURE DIAMOND
[23:40:44] <fandio> coldhead: REALLY!?
[23:40:52] <fandio> why haven't I heard of this!?
[23:40:55] * fandio checks reddit
[23:41:15] <fandio> anli_: yeah, I guess I'm just not used to all the raw-string DOM manipulation
[23:41:27] <fandio> web developing is not my native programming domain :)
[23:41:56] <coldhead> fandio: you should be able to avoid the string stuff with jQuery
[23:42:41] <coldhead> var something = $('<div />', {class: 'monkeys'}).text('lol aids');
[23:42:42] <fandio> coldhead: heh, i'll summarize my 20-minute conversation with anli_ for you. best-practice for creating dynamic <form>s with jQuery?
[23:43:04] <coldhead> fandio: use a template library like mustache.js
[23:43:11] <coldhead> >: \
[23:43:17] <anli_> hehe, well, stay away from the <form> tag unless you send files
[23:43:37] <anli_> Instead use $.post('foo.php', data, function(webpage){});
[23:43:54] <anli_> or $.post('foo.php', data, function(result_object){}, 'json');
[23:43:55] <gnarf> fandio: use inputs, with real names...
[23:44:07] <gnarf> just change the names for "new feilds"
[23:44:12] <coldhead> like "bob", "charlie", "alasdair"?
[23:44:17] <anli_> And if you can get rid of ids, do it, at least use classes instead (but not for identification)
[23:44:51] <fandio> how about I just post some code? I feel like what you're saying is very similar to what i've done. one moment :)
[23:45:25] <coldhead> if you use string concatenation anywhere YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER
[23:45:27] <coldhead> or miss
[23:47:26] <coldhead> hey jojo_
[23:48:11] <fandio> coldhead: mister, and yeah that's precisely why I'm hear
[23:48:35] <coldhead> here*
[23:48:43] <fandio> anyway, please please please don't try reading this carefully. just glance over it to get the jist of what awful things I'm doing: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/466916/
[23:49:05] <fandio> string concating galore
[23:49:19] <fandio> coldhead: oh jesus did I really just misuse a homophone?
[23:49:35] <fandio> well i guess that's what I get for trying to stimulate my brain at 2AM
[23:50:34] <coldhead> it's going to be okay
[23:50:55] <fandio> lol
[23:51:01] <coldhead> i would use a function that does your ctnId_n for you
[23:51:06] <coldhead> to save you typing it over and over
[23:51:32] <fandio> that's certainly a good idea
[23:51:57] <coldhead> and i would avoid setting it in HTML strings, i'd rather go $('<element>', {id: thinger(cntID, n)})
[23:52:06] <fandio> the worst parts are those massive HTML chunks with about 100 str concats
[23:52:25] <coldhead> or $('<element>').attr('id', thinger(cntId, n));
[23:52:41] <fandio> ah, so let jQuery do the HTML generation for me?
[23:53:07] <coldhead> tables you can build like $('<table>').append('<tr><td>lol</td></tr>')
[23:53:09] <coldhead> or whatever
[23:53:30] <coldhead> but if you're getting seriously into that, something that lets you do templates is your saviour
[23:53:41] <coldhead> because then you can keep the html in the html
[23:53:43] <coldhead> not the JS
[23:54:04] <fandio> like client-side templates?
[23:54:05] <coldhead> but in either case, yeah, lean on jQuery for that as much as possible
[23:54:08] <coldhead> yes!
[23:54:10] <fandio> o.o
[23:55:05] <coldhead> have a google, mustache.js is the popular one lately
[23:55:15] <coldhead> there's also a jquery tmpl from microsoft
[23:55:18] <fandio> i assumed I wouldn't need those JS templating systems since Django has it's own server-side one
[23:55:21] <coldhead> which it's fashionable to curse
[23:55:30] <fandio> yeah i'm looking at Mustache now
[23:56:17] <coldhead> fandio: the argument for using a client side one as well is your massive string concat :)
[23:58:04] <coldhead> JUSSST in case
[23:58:16] <coldhead> also she'll probably have pride
[23:58:33] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[23:58:58] <fandio> lol I was going to ask..
[23:59:07] <fandio> coldhead: okay so let me try and wrap my head around this
