[00:00:52] <Arimil> hm yeah i think I'll try to make the iframe pass the image name to the parent somehow
[00:01:17] <Flo0815> but, why is it more secure to use an iframe?
[00:01:24] <Flo0815> never heard of that
[00:01:42] <aismail_> hello people, is there some kind of semaphore available for Javascript?
[00:01:42] <Arimil> it isn't it's just a browser won't let you submit a file using ajax
[00:02:05] <aismail_> if multiple AJAX requests return in parallel, the callbacks might run in parallel and screw things up in might data structure :)
[00:02:14] <aismail_> (actually, it already happens, not "might")
[00:02:37] <AaronDCampbell> I'd like to catch all clicks in a certain element that is NOT on a link (including any element IN a link).  Is there a better way than grabbing the target and checking up the line?
[00:02:42] <Flo0815> Arimil: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[00:03:20] <Flo0815> AaronDCampbell: $('#element[not:a]').on('click'...
[00:03:37] <Arimil> Flo0815: that's quite a lot more than what I need though, I only need to upload 1 image :S i don't want users to upload multiple images
[00:04:53] <Flo0815> http://www.zurb.com/playground/ajax_upload
[00:04:59] <Flo0815> Arimil: http://www.zurb.com/playground/ajax_upload
[00:05:22] <AaronDCampbell> Flo0815: What about a click that happens on "div#element a span" ...I don't want this, but I DO want "div#element p span" etc
[00:05:36] <Flo0815> hmmm
[00:06:01] <Flo0815> why should u want that...
[00:06:14] <Flo0815> isn't there a simpler way? may be u need tu change ur html
[00:06:26] <AaronDCampbell> Links should go to their location.  Anywhere else in the row should expand the row
[00:07:52] <Arimil> Flo0815: that doesn't actually work either
[00:07:59] <Arimil> their demo is broken, both of them
[00:08:24] <Arimil> and they link to a plugin that I found earlier that only sends the server the data type and not the file
[00:08:30] <Arimil> :\
[00:08:56] <Flo0815> hm ok...sry
[00:09:02] <Flo0815> but it is possible with ajax
[00:09:47] <tehnoobifier> hello, i got an efficiency question for you guys
[00:10:31] <tehnoobifier> when you are removing a class, is it more efficient to select the elements that have that class, and then remove it, or just let it find the elements with that class
[00:11:03] <Cork> tehnoobifier: depends
[00:11:22] <Flo0815> +1 Cork for understanding questions
[00:11:26] <Cork> if you need to do something with all other elements and it can be part of it
[00:11:30] <Flo0815> maybe it's too early fpr me
[00:11:37] <Cork> then yes do it in the loop
[00:12:02] <Cork> else, no selecting on the class is faster then looping over a bunch of elements
[00:12:49] <tehnoobifier> i dont get the last part. are you saying no, to including the class being removed?
[00:12:58] <tehnoobifier> in the selector
[00:13:54] <Cork> $('*').each(function() { $(this).removeClass('my-class'); }); is slower then $('.my-class').removeClass('my-class');
[00:14:17] <Cork> tehnoobifier: so if you have a loop already yes it can be faster
[00:14:28] <Cork> but looping instead of doing a selection isn't
[00:14:55] <tehnoobifier> ok, cool, thanks
[00:15:20] <Cork> tehnoobifier: it all depends on how many non matching element you get
[00:15:28] <Cork> (in the loop)
[00:15:30] <AaronDCampbell> Flo0815: I'm using this for now and it works: if ( ! target.is( 'a' ) && ! target.parents( 'a' ).size() ) {}
[00:16:18] <tehnoobifier> well, I guess if there are a max of 10 elements total, it probably isnt that big of a deal
[00:16:32] <Cork> then it prob doesn't matter either way ya
[00:16:53] <Cork> but most of the time selecting on the class and removing on all of them is easier to read
[00:17:02] <tehnoobifier> whats a good number, I got a page that has 130 of a div#myclass, for example
[00:17:05] <Cork> so its faviorable for that reason
[00:20:18] <Arimil> hm so I read that you can access an iframes variables using $('#frame').variable however this would requires me to wait until the upload is finished
[00:20:55] <Arimil> I tried to accomplish this by changine $('#imageform').submit() to
[00:21:22] <Arimil> $('#imageform').submit(function(){ //get variable here });
[00:21:40] <Arimil> however now the form doesn't submit and the jquery documentation says this should work :S
[00:21:45] <Flo0815> :D
[00:21:48] <Flo0815> congrats
[00:21:55] <tehnoobifier> is there a function that toggles .on() and .off()
[00:22:09] <Cork> tehnoobifier: no
[00:22:11] <Flo0815> $('#imageform').submit(function(){ $(this).submit(); })
[00:22:18] <Cork> use a value and check it in your event handler
[00:22:45] <tehnoobifier> yeah, been doing that, just thought there might be a nifty toggle for it
[00:22:49] <Cork> $(target).data('disabled', true); if(!$(this).data('disabled)) {}
[00:22:55] <Arimil> Flo0815: is there a way to check if the form is done submiting?
[00:23:49] <Flo0815> Arimil: no, if u submit a form in the classic way, u reload or change the site, so JS can't recognize this
[00:23:53] <tehnoobifier> @Cork, yeah, if been using a class and then checking against it, I guess thats the same thing
[00:24:10] <Flo0815> Arimil: if u do it with ajax, yes cu can
[00:24:19] <Flo0815> if u do it with ur iframe...
[00:24:21] <Flo0815> hm.
[00:24:23] <Cork> tehnoobifier: ya, close enough
[00:24:35] <Cork> tehnoobifier: you can toggle the class then though
[00:25:29] <tehnoobifier> i've never used .data() before, is that better than setting a class, and then checking if it hasClass
[00:25:32] <ennio> hi
[00:25:34] <ennio> !list
[00:25:40] <Cork> ...
[00:26:08] <Cork> fserv bot hunters are everywhere -_-
[00:26:15] <Flo0815> Arimil: maybe u should put sth like $(document).ready... in the iframes loaded page
[00:26:22] <Flo0815> and pass sth. to the parent window
[00:26:37] <Cork> you could listhen for a load even on the iframe though
[00:26:40] <Arimil> Flo0815: well I found out how to get the filename from the frame however to code to get the variable from the iframe is going off before the upload completes and the iframe is loaded
[00:26:46] <Arimil> thus it is returning undefined
[00:26:46] <Cork> *event
[00:27:05] <tehnoobifier> does anybody know why when you have alert() inside .one() function, it triggers multiple times?
[00:27:22] <tehnoobifier> when it should, in fact trigger only once
[00:27:59] <Cork> tehnoobifier: alert freezes the js so jquery prob don't have the time to remove the listner
[00:28:03] <Flo0815> Arimil: maybe ths can help u: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/09/15/iframes-onload-and-documentdomain/
[00:28:11] <Cork> (never seen it though, so only guessing)
[00:28:28] <tehnoobifier> http://jsfiddle.net/c7BUP/7/
[00:28:38] <tehnoobifier> try that
[00:29:10] <Cork> tehnoobifier: what browser?
[00:29:14] <Cork> wfm
[00:29:14] <caniuse> Cork: Works For Me
[00:29:21] <tehnoobifier> Chrome, latest
[00:29:42] * Cork hate the defenition "latest"
[00:29:55] <tehnoobifier> 18
[00:30:17] <Cork> chrommium gives me one dialog too
[00:30:23] <tehnoobifier> idk man, i dont have the string of numbers that comprize the GChrome version
[00:30:44] <Cork> tehnoobifier: just skippit
[00:30:49] <Cork> most of the time it doesn't matter
[00:30:54] <tehnoobifier> 18.0.1025.142 m
[00:31:00] <Cork> :D
[00:31:06] <Cork> you forgot the build date ;)
[00:31:31] <tehnoobifier> lol
[00:31:40] <tehnoobifier> ima punch you
[00:31:49] <Cork> chromium and firefox on linux works for me
[00:32:08] <tehnoobifier> anyways, Opera 11.62 and Firefox 11 also give alert multiple times
[00:32:33] <Cork> hmm, wait i think i miss interpreted your question >_>
[00:32:34] <tehnoobifier> its gotta be a bug in jquery
[00:32:36] <Cork> let me try again
[00:33:13] <tehnoobifier> its .one(), so it should unbind itself on first trigger, but the alert() comes up every time you hover over the element
[00:33:32] <Cork> tehnoobifier: http://jsfiddle.net/c7BUP/8/
[00:33:38] <Cork> alert has nothing to do with it
[00:33:44] <Cork> one on mouseenter never resets
[00:34:16] <tehnoobifier> how do you get it to do that
[00:34:23] <Cork> do what?
[00:34:24] <tehnoobifier> isnt that the point of one
[00:34:38] <Cork> mouseenter is a faked event
[00:34:49] <Cork> jquery runs mouseover and some extra checks
[00:34:50] <tehnoobifier> whats the real event
[00:35:04] <Cork> no, dom doesn't have mouseenter
[00:35:05] <k1t> hey folks, any recommendations on how to make repetitive statements like http://pastie.org/3731593 a bit less... well, repetitive
[00:35:33] <k1t> i have that same situation over and over in this bit of code here
[00:35:34] <ShadowChancellor> make that a function
[00:35:53] <tehnoobifier> $('#keyframe-list, .nav-tabs li.keyframe-tab'').addClass('active');
[00:35:55] <tehnoobifier> ?
[00:36:02] <k1t> tehnoobifier: ah, that would be it
[00:36:28] <k1t> ShadowChancellor: that -would- make sense but i only do these statements a couple time,
[00:36:32] <k1t> times*
[00:36:35] <k1t> thx guys
[00:36:53] <Arimil> *sigh* it doesn't seem that there is any callbacks for .submit because everyone expects the page to reload when it is used
[00:36:57] <ShadowChancellor> np
[00:36:58] <Arimil> which in my case it does not :\
[00:37:02] <Cork> tehnoobifier: next interesting part, its a regression in 1.7 http://jsfiddle.net/c7BUP/9/
[00:37:16] <Flo0815> Arimil: so maybe u should change ur upload
[00:37:31] <Flo0815> if everybody else does it in another way
[00:38:15] <tehnoobifier> hey @Cork, so $selector.one('mouseover', handler) wouldnt trigger multiple times?
[00:38:22] <Arimil> i don't know of another way to do it though
[00:38:31] <Cork> tehnoobifier: yes
[00:38:49] <Cork> though what it triggers for differ
[00:39:24] <tehnoobifier> so whats the difference between mouseenter and mouseover
[00:39:43] <Flo0815> Arimil: google-> ajax image upload
[00:41:16] <Cork> tehnoobifier: when you go from a child element to the parent element mouseover triggers
[00:41:19] <Cork> but not mouseenter
[00:41:26] <Cork> ?.mouseenter
[00:41:26] <bot-t> .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[00:42:01] <Cork> for a one trigger it most likely doesn't matter
[00:42:16] <Cork> (you could prob just use hover instead)
[00:42:17] <tehnoobifier> with the alert() it did
[00:42:41] <Cork> tehnoobifier: what do you mean?
[00:42:55] <Cork> if you mean the reset yes, but thats not what i meant
[00:43:09] <tehnoobifier> yeah, thats what I mean
[00:43:26] <Cork> i meant that as your only interested in it one time the difference between mouseenter/mouseover/hover shouldn't matter
[00:43:44] <tehnoobifier> yeah, but...
[00:43:50] <Cork> so any of them in one (except that mouseenter is broken) should work
[00:44:09] <tehnoobifier> is it the alert that breaks the unbind, or is it like that regardless of an alert()
[00:44:19] <Cork> has nothing to do with alert
[00:44:27] <Cork> its that mouseenter is a faked event
[00:44:38] <Cork> prob same with mouseleave
[00:44:46] <tehnoobifier> well, its a jquery event, isnt it
[00:45:06] <tehnoobifier> they use it in the examples for hover
[00:45:07] <Cork> yes, its a jquery event compared to a dom native event
[00:45:27] <Cork> tehnoobifier: i'm not arguing about if it should work
[00:45:37] <Cork> i'm just explaining where they differ
[00:45:49] <tehnoobifier> well, then my point is, that maybe its a bug since its a jquery event that breaking the one() function
[00:45:51] <Cork> and thats why one of them work and the other doesn't
[00:45:56] <tehnoobifier> i get that
[00:46:03] <tehnoobifier> im not arguing about that any more
[00:46:14] <Cork> tehnoobifier: if you read up what i've typed, i already confirmed that its a bug
[00:46:47] <Cork> most specifically in "<Cork> tehnoobifier: next interesting part, its a regression in 1.7"
[00:46:57] <Xotix> Is it possible to make the scroll wheel just scroll the bar if it is on the window of this scrollbar? e.g. while hovering over div x, scrolling just works for div x.
[00:47:30] <tehnoobifier> i thought you meant something else
[00:48:15] <Cork> tehnoobifier: one('mouseenter'), one('mouseleave') works in jquery 1.6.4 but not in 1.7.x
[00:48:23] <tehnoobifier> anyways, I just wanted to figure out if it was a bug or not, cuz I think its kind of cool that i found a way to break jquery
[00:48:57] <Cork> tehnoobifier: see if you can find a bug in the bug tracker, or create one
[00:49:12] <tehnoobifier> especially since I think that jquery is pretty much magic
[00:49:12] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[00:49:25] <Cork> nothing magical about it
[00:49:35] <tehnoobifier> maybe if you understand it
[00:49:56] <tehnoobifier> for me, I just type some selectors and some words between dots and () and shit works
[00:49:56] <coldhead> far dumber people than you file bugs there every day, don't worry
[00:50:09] <Cork> heh
[00:50:31] <f0rkn1ght> anyone know of the example that scrolls vertically with the mouse through a list of images
[00:55:19] <tehnoobifier> lol, a bunch of bugs for the one() on mouseenter just got filed
[00:56:48] <tehnoobifier> actually nvm, those are old
[00:57:46] <nVee> hey guys, I am using jquery sortable and move input boxes from one div to another. By default the input boxes are disabled, but I want to enable them on move to the other div. What is the best way to do this?
[00:58:21] <Xotix> nVee check out the events of sortable?
[00:59:00] <tehnoobifier> alright, good night, thanks for all the help
[00:59:30] <ShadowChancellor> okay I've got a question: in this fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/burHX/7/), I've got two divs with mouseenter and mouseleave binds…if you mouse over the divs quickly, it breaks…how should I fix this?
[01:02:10] <Xotix> ShadowChancellor: Just show infos if it hovers for 1 sec or something?
[01:02:23] <Xotix> like that
[01:03:14] <ShadowChancellor> that might work…lemme give it a try
[01:04:34] <pzuraq> hey there, working on my first plugin and can't quite get it working right. Just want to make a simple slider that I can instantiate multiple times on one page, figured I'd learn some jquery.

[01:09:17] <Eviltwin> Plugins are an "advanced" jQuery topic
[01:09:22] <Eviltwin> It's not really a good starting point
[01:09:42] <Eviltwin> This is a much better jQuery starting point: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[01:09:52] <pzuraq> Eviltwin: like, I've had experience modifying plugins and I pretty much only use jquery if I'm making my own javascript methods/functions
[01:10:12] <pzuraq> I made a simple slider function, but as I said I want to instantiate it multiple times, so I figured I'd make a class
[01:10:26] <pzuraq> came to find js doesn't have classes, perse... so I'm trying for a simple plugin?
[01:10:36] <pzuraq> I got part of it working :D
[01:10:51] <Xotix> pzuraq are they going to be manipulated? actually click should work, sry. and for me, it works
[01:11:40] <pzuraq> Xotix: The click function works? Strange... hmmm

[01:15:19] <pzuraq> hmm, interesting
[01:15:45] <pzuraq> so maybe when I'm sending $(this) to switchTabs, its not actually sending the right object?
[01:15:54] <pzuraq> hmm, how to get around that...
[01:16:16] <Xotix> pzuraq: if you know other coding alnguages you might take a look at http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/ just some info about JS
[01:16:20] <Eviltwin> Put this in a var
[01:16:26] <Xotix> this is the clicked element
[01:16:38] <pzuraq> ah, ok
[01:16:46] <pzuraq> put this is a var and it works now :D
[01:17:10] <pzuraq> and definitely Xotix, this and the wf link look like interesting reads
[01:17:24] <pzuraq> I'm continually surprised by how different js is from other languages I know
[01:17:33] <pzuraq> but, I'm finally getting somewhere
[01:18:12] <Xotix> pzuraq: there's also a google video about js/prototypal, its quite good to understand it.
[01:18:38] <pzuraq> prototypal?
[01:18:51] <Xotix> read the link :)
[01:19:04] <pzuraq> mmk
[01:19:13] <Xotix> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#object.prototype
[01:26:32] <pzuraq> sweet, is working as needed :D
[01:26:47] <pzuraq> I'm definitely gunna expand this thing though. Would like to have my own slider.
[01:54:12] <pen> how do I get the width of an element while detached?
[01:54:19] <pen> width() doesn't work
[01:56:36] <quicksilver> I don't think elements have widths while detached.
[01:56:55] <pzuraq> ok so, how is the prototype part of the object important? I kind of understand the prototype toolchain, inheritance and such, but what do you do with the .prototype part? Why not just directly inherit from an object?
[01:56:57] <quicksilver> an element's width is a property of how it is inserted in the DOM, it depends in general on all the other elements around it...
[01:57:04] <pzuraq> Sorry if that doesn't make sense, tired
[01:58:01] <quicksilver> the .prototype *is* directly inheriting from the object
[01:58:04] <quicksilver> that's what it does
[01:58:11] <quicksilver> how do you store which object you want to inherit from?
[01:58:19] <quicksilver> answer : you store it in the 'prototype' property.
[01:58:41] <pzuraq> ahhh, ok
[01:58:54] <pzuraq> sorry, was getting confused with the extra bits added in
[01:59:06] <pzuraq> assigning variables/methods to the prototype
[01:59:15] <pzuraq> but that makes sense
[01:59:20] <pzuraq> cause they are also objects
[01:59:21] <pzuraq> ok
[02:14:12] <Xotix> if i have a set of a's, how can i search for one with a specific href?
[02:15:42] <quicksilver> Xotix: $("a[href=blah]")
[02:16:42] <Xotix> quicksilver: hmm thanks
[02:19:11] <Cork> you prob want href$= or href*= though
[02:19:19] <lost123> hi
[02:19:20] <Cork> so you don't have to write the complete url
[02:19:39] <lost123> my javascript doesn't work after i reload the htm with ajax request
[02:19:53] <Xotix> $("a[href=/template/Search]") gives me unrecognized expression:
[02:20:13] <Cork> $('a[href="/template/Search"]')
[02:20:51] <Xotix> thanks
[02:21:09] <anli_> Does an iframe have its own window object?
[02:21:12] <woozly> guys, how to wrote function, which I can append to object? Like: $('#mydiv').myFunc(); ?
[02:21:24] <Cork> anli_: yes
[02:21:30] <woozly> myFunc must put some content to #mydiv object
[02:21:34] <anli_> I want to call a function in the webpage hosting the iframe, something I have done a lot of times
[02:21:43] <lost123> how can make js fire again after the ajax response has added html?
[02:21:45] <anli_> $('window', window').foo()?
[02:21:47] <anli_> oops
[02:21:51] <anli_> $('window', window).foo()
[02:21:56] <Cork> lost123: if you replace elements you've attached event listners too you need to rebind them
[02:22:03] <Xotix> lost123 use the callback?
[02:22:05] <Cork> lost123: or you need to use delegated event listners
[02:22:32] <Cork> woozly: add the function to $.fn
[02:22:50] <woozly> Cork, thanks!
[02:22:51] <Cork> $.fn.myFunc = function() {}
[02:23:02] <woozly> good. thank you Cork!
[02:23:12] <Cork> np
[02:23:16] <lost123> Cork it will call which function?
[02:23:42] <Cork> lost123: what?
[02:24:09] <lost123> Cork: my js file is included in the header but its not called anywhere apparently,but it works on slides
[02:24:23] <lost123> how can i know which function of js to call?
[02:26:03] <lost123> oh sorry that was for woozly not me
[02:26:20] <Cork> lost123: yes :)
[02:26:25] <lost123> Cork: where should i call the delegated event listners
[02:26:35] <lost123> i can show you the link
[02:27:06] <Cork> lost123: ex. if you now do $('.my-class').on('click') but the .my-class element is replaced
[02:27:33] <Cork> you can instead do $('.persistent-parent-that-is-not-replaced').on('click', '.my-class')
[02:27:45] <chilversc_> anyone know any decent libraries that support locatization in javascript?
[02:27:57] <chilversc_> source text is stored in gettext po files, and has plural forms
[02:27:58] <Cork> lost123:  and it will catch the clicks on all child elements that has the class my-class
[02:28:23] <Cork> lost123: the trick is to make sure the element you use in the selector is never replaced
[02:28:33] <Cork> $() <-- that selector
[02:28:35] <anli_> I tried $('window', window).outerfunction(); from inside an iframe without luck
[02:28:37] <lost123> hmm
[02:28:44] <anli_> What can be a better way?
[02:28:44] <lost123> its not being replaced
[02:29:00] <anli_> Hm, maybe I need to get(0) that window
[02:29:00] <Cork> lost123: so the ajax never modify the content of the page?
[02:29:26] <lost123> Cork: it does by changing the html in the #slidercontainer
[02:29:43] <Xotix> $('#foo a[href="'+myVar+'"]') how can i do something like this?
[02:29:46] <Cork> and you have no bound event listner for anything inside it?
[02:30:27] <lost123> i don't understand your question
[02:30:47] <lost123> this is what i have done in my $.post function in success callback  $("#slidercontainer").html(response);
[02:30:47] <lost123> },"html");
[02:30:50] <Cork> lost123: ok, you need to generate a pb of your page
[02:30:54] <Cork> ?p @ lost123
[02:30:55] <bot-t> lost123, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:31:00] <Cork> including the html
[02:31:20] <lost123> Cork:right,but its better if you check out the live example
[02:31:26] <lost123> and see what you get on console
[02:31:46] <Cork> lost123: we can try, if thats enough
[02:32:00] <lost123> i have put upmy page at http://tinyurl.com/87p4pot
[02:32:02] <Cork> pb can be modified so its easier to check
[02:33:14] <Cork> lost123: and the str? (Step To Reproduce)

[02:36:59] <Cork> lost123: thats not what i asked for.. anyway ignore the pb
[02:37:13] <Cork> but i need to know how to reproduce your problem
[02:41:59] <lost123> Cork did you get the pb link?
[02:42:25] * Cork points at his questions
[02:42:38] <lost123> how to reproduce?
[02:42:59] <Cork> yes
[02:43:17] <Cork> the what i ased for was a reproduced demo
[02:43:21] <Cork> a working fiddle
[02:43:35] <Cork> for the live page i need to know what to do to see what you have problem with
[02:43:48] <pzuraq> is there any way to find an element if it is within another element, without regard to how many "levels" deep it is? Like, if in one case it might be the firstchild, but another case it might be within the firstchild
[02:44:05] <lost123> Cork: on the live page click the button on top 'netx five'
[02:44:14] <lost123> and check the slider
[02:44:26] <Cork> ?.find @ pzuraq
[02:44:27] <bot-t> pzuraq, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[02:44:45] <lost123> the nextfive loads the new html but the js that is suppose to run the slideshow stops
[02:45:24] <lost123> sothe slider doesn't work after ajax call, after clicking the button you can check the console too,it willshow you the ajax response
[02:49:13] <anli_> What the correct jquery for calling a function in an outer document (an iframe hosting document)
[02:49:21] <chx> i am trying to override parseJSON, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/576406/ but i do not get the json on the console (i checked and the file loads)
[02:50:28] <malinens> jquery-ui datepicker question: how to get more dates in select box? in want to get all years from 1960-2012 in select box but it always limits number of elements to 13
[02:50:59] <Flo0815> chx: whats the output of j?
[02:51:11] <chx> Flo0815: nothing. there's no console output
[02:51:27] <Flo0815> chx: remove the if(typeof...
[02:52:13] <PavelloZ> ?.children

[02:52:15] <lost123> http://pastebin.com/4iS6Ey10
[02:52:23] <lost123> this is the page and slider code
[02:52:54] <Flo0815> chx: the whole line. is sth happening?
[02:52:55] <lost123> the slider.js stops working after ajax loads the new html in #slidercontainer
[02:53:16] <Flo0815> lost123: i think u need to call the slider again
[02:53:19] <Flo0815> with the new element
[02:53:25] <chx> Flo0815: if i add a  console.log('loaded'); before jQuery.fn.parseJSON = function(j) { i see that one
[02:53:28] <Flo0815> initialize it again
[02:53:42] <chx> Flo0815: but otherwise, no, afaik
[02:53:44] <lost123> Flo0815, i called the js file again using $getScript but doesn't work
[02:54:12] <Cork> anli_: $('iframe').prop('contentWindow').variable
[02:54:34] <lost123> line 49 of pb i called the script again
[02:54:37] <Flo0815> chx: so you call your overwritten function and no output is in the console
[02:54:38] <Flo0815> ?
[02:55:07] <Flo0815> chx: what u posted is only the declaration of the function
[02:55:12] <Flo0815> it doesn't call the function
[02:55:31] <chx> Flo0815: a framework calls it in on ajax
[02:56:11] <chx> Flo0815: looks like    response = $.parseJSON(response); this. and i am getting an error from parseJSON all right because the reason i need to override parseJSON is a server in the chain adds garbage and need to be removed.
[02:56:34] <Flo0815> chx: if the function is properly called, add a console.log('test');
[02:56:58] <chx> the $ gets its value from (function ($) {})(jQuery); does this somehow kill my idea?
[02:57:02] <Flo0815> if it's not in the console, the function isnÄt called
[02:57:30] <chx> i guessed that, but i am tryign to figure it out why not
[02:57:46] <Flo0815> or try: jQuery.parseJSON instead of $.parse...
[02:57:58] <chx> should i override jQuery.parseJSON instead jQuery.fn?
[02:58:07] <quicksilver> yes
[02:58:15] <Cork> $.fn is for selectors
[02:58:17] <quicksilver> the 'fn' ones are called on DOM objects
[02:58:26] <quicksilver> $('blah').parseJSON would be the 'fn' one
[02:58:36] <quicksilver> $.parseJSON is just, well, it's just $.parseJSON
[02:59:09] <chx> i dunno -- $ is so much magic :)
[02:59:18] <chx> oh hai
[02:59:20] <chx> that worked.
[02:59:24] <Flo0815> :)
[02:59:27] <Poetro_> :)
[02:59:42] <quicksilver> chx: it's not magic at all. It's just javascript.
[02:59:48] <chx> now my ugly little regexp...
[03:00:02] <quicksilver> $.parseJSON is completely not-magic, trying to use .fn was you misunderstanding the other magic :)
[03:00:09] <quicksilver> although the other magic still isn't magic.
[03:00:43] <Flo0815> so, that i'm getting this right: jQuery.fn.(functionname) is for use of $('#element').function...
[03:01:05] <Flo0815> and jQuery.(functionname) is for $.(functionname), right?
[03:02:00] <Flo0815> hm thats stupid... for example $.each() is declared in jQuery.each = function
[03:02:24] <Flo0815> and $('.element').each() is declared in jQuery.fn.each = function
[03:02:33] <Flo0815> right?
[03:02:52] <Cork> yes
[03:02:56] <Flo0815> kt hx
[03:03:16] <Cork> ?eval $
[03:03:18] <bot-t> Cork: <function (selector, context) {return new (jQuery.fn.init)(selector, context);}>
[03:03:22] <Cork> :)
[03:04:02] <Cork> ?eval $.test = function() { return 1; }; $.fn.sel = function() { return 2; }; $('*').sel()
[03:04:02] <bot-t> Cork: 2
[03:04:10] <Cork> ?eval $.test = function() { return 1; }; $.fn.sel = function() { return 2; }; $.test()
[03:04:10] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[03:04:47] <Flo0815> ok
[03:04:54] <Flo0815> thanks
[03:05:09] <Flo0815> but you have to admint it, there is alittle magic behind all that :)
[03:05:25] <Cork> not really its just prototype
[03:09:51] <Flo0815> yeah...the prototyping is magic for me right now
[03:10:19] <Flo0815> i didn't work with it before, or, i did and i didn't know
[03:10:30] <Flo0815> so that's the next thing i'm gonna learn
[03:11:16] <lost123> its strange why js won't fire with newly added htm
[03:12:04] <Flo0815> lost123: i think u need to reinitialize the slider
[03:12:20] <Flo0815> because the element you initialized it on, is not there any more
[03:12:37] <AdvoWork> I've got: <button id="create_vendor">Create Vendor</button> and am doing: $('#create_vendor').click( function(){ event.preventDefault();	...  in chrome this works fine, but in firefox, it submits the form(ie it submits to the action=""  any suggestiosn please?
[03:13:04] <Flo0815> AdvoWork: add a return false;
[03:13:35] <Flo0815> ah, or $('#create_vendor').click( function(event){ event.preventDefault();	.
[03:17:45] <lost123> Flo0815: how can i reinialize js ?
[03:18:03] <lost123> i woould do that after my ajax success callback right
[03:18:06] <Flo0815> lost123: no js. u need to reinitialize the slider
[03:18:10] <AdvoWork> Flo0815, i already do preventDefault() ?
[03:18:16] <Flo0815> u call the slider somehow
[03:18:37] <Flo0815> AdvoWork: $('#create_vendor').click( function(event){ event.preventDefault();	.
[03:18:49] <lost123> ok i will look into that
[03:18:50] <Flo0815> lost123: and u need to call the slider again after the html is inserted
[03:18:54] <lost123> thanks a lot
[03:28:18] <davidw> is it just me or does 'mousemove' only fire once in IE8?
[03:31:35] <lost123> Flo0815 thank again, you made my day =)
[03:31:38] <lost123> it works
[03:31:55] <lost123> i reinialized the slider in the ajax response
[04:02:42] <hypo> hi
[04:03:24] <hypo> why code on http://jsfiddle.net/uS38B/ does not work?
[04:04:45] <Slydder> hey all. I have the following code (http://pastie.org/3732357) and am needing to save the box locations and reload them in the correct positions when the site is reloaded (save around lines 76, 84 and 116) how could I do this?
[04:04:57] <PavelloZ> hypo: can you prepare a proper demo? :)
[04:05:35] <osirisx11> hi all
[04:05:39] <PavelloZ> hypo: first: you try to set focus on $(element).val()
[04:05:44] <PavelloZ> that is always a bad sign
[04:05:45] <PavelloZ> :))
[04:05:55] <osirisx11> is there a way i can do a multipart select? input[name='n' + value='v']?
[04:06:08] <osirisx11> for a selector i mean
[04:08:48] <hypo> http://jsfiddle.net/uS38B/2/ a bit buggy full version
[04:09:35] <nFFF> osirisx11 yea
[04:09:40] <nFFF> but not in that notation
[04:09:56] <nFFF> use [first][second]
[04:10:14] <PavelloZ> ok hypo as i said, dont try to set focus on the element value, tip number 1
[04:10:23] <PavelloZ> tip number 2 - try to understand how to use fiddle js :)
[04:10:27] <PavelloZ> ?demo
[04:10:28] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:10:31] <osirisx11> perfect ty nFFF
[04:13:42] <nFFF> hypo can't even work out to put the javascript in the javascript section of jsfiddle
[04:13:44] <nFFF> gl
[04:21:05] <hypo> something like this http://jsfiddle.net/uS38B/4/ ?
[04:21:45] <dannN> Hi. Is it possible to use $ as jQuery selector between motools code?
[04:23:07] <Cork> dannN: you mean have $ be used by jQuery temporarly?
[04:23:21] <Kartagis> hi
[04:23:23] <risky_s> anyone know of any jquery blog plugins?
[04:24:36] <dannN> Cork: We've a CMS which uses MooTools. I want to use jQuery too. To write a better code I want to use the MooTools Class. Within i.e. var Cv = new Class() { } i want to use $. Is this possible?
[04:25:31] <Kartagis> I'm trying to use the masked input plugin at http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin to no avail. can you help me achieve it?
[04:28:50] <hypo> please guys:)
[04:55:35] <Kartagis> I'm trying to use the masked input plugin at http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin to no avail. can you help me achieve it?
[04:56:20] <sunbeam> What is currently the best way to display / use a font that's not standard ? (eg. surface)
[04:56:41] <Cork> sunbeam: don't dubble post
[04:57:02] <Cork> and the solution for that would be the @font tag
[04:57:14] <sunbeam> for IE6 too?
[04:57:19] <Cork> yes
[04:57:40] <sunbeam> ah EOT format right
[04:57:53] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@font-face#Browser_compatibility
[04:58:01] <Cork> ie was the one the introduced @font-face
[04:58:07] <Cork> *that
[04:58:12] <RichardP> Hi, what might be the general reason for actions not working?  I can select the element and output it in an alert fine (alert($(".myelement").html())), but .remove, .append, .hide, .click etc do nothing on that element
[04:58:26] <RichardP> jquery works fine elsewhere on the page
[04:59:00] <sunbeam> Cork: ok so basically when i use @font-face 99% of the browsers display my font properly
[04:59:10] <sunbeam> 99% of the browser users
[04:59:16] <Cork> .99 now days
[04:59:51] <Cork> exceptions would basically be really old firefox browsers
[04:59:58] <Cork> and those arn't supported anymore anyway
[05:00:14] <sunbeam> ok
[05:00:30] <sunbeam> Cork: actually, how come so many people (also top developers) kept using cufon for such long time?
[05:01:11] <Cork> cause it wasn't long ago that the support became universal
[05:01:37] <Cork> but those browser that didn't becomes eol quite fast
[05:01:56] <Cork> so they'r depricated now days
[05:02:01] <sunbeam> ok
[05:02:18] <sunbeam> the only tricky is that i would need to convert each of my font i use (surface for example) to .eot format for IE
[05:02:39] <Cork> ya
[05:20:20] <DEac-> dir zuschickenhi
[05:20:24] <DEac-> ups sorry
[05:21:39] <sunbeam> whats the easiest way on windows 7 to convert otf format to eot?
[05:22:36] <DEac-> i've a question about html-parsing in jquery: i've htmlcode like this: c='<div><div><span>hallo</span><script>console.log("ups!")</script><span>auf wiedersehen</span></div></div>'; if i call $(a) i get a <div> and a <script>. if i call $('<div></div>').html(a), the embedded script will be called.  how i can get one object?
[05:41:56] <seas> hmm my problem is that some other js (i have no controll over it, have to use a template..) overrides $.fn.tabs and i need to use the jquery ui tabs.. any ideas how i could rebind the ui tabs to something other or something like that?
[05:42:06] <DEADB33F> Is it possible to set a cookie just for a single ajax request?
[05:43:29] <Kartagis> I'm trying to use the masked input plugin at http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin to no avail. can you help me achieve it?
[05:46:06] <DEac-> seas: if your template overrides it, it's possible, that it backuped the original. a expensive way is to load jquery a twice
[05:46:07] <Silex> how do I convert html arrays to json? $.serializeArray() is a good start but keeps names like "person[items][]"
[05:46:23] <DEac-> DEADB33F: client or server?
[05:46:54] <DEADB33F> Client.
[05:47:15] <DEac-> DEADB33F: i don't know, but you should be able to manipulate the header of your ajax-request
[05:47:25] <DEADB33F> I want to make a bunch of requests with different cookies for each.
[05:47:37] <DEac-> DEADB33F: but, search for a cleaner an better way
[05:47:53] <DEac-> should be possible
[05:49:02] <seas> yeah i already thought about loading it again, but i kinda hoped to not do that,
[05:49:04] <DEac-> Silex: Silex what's wrong with person[items][]?
[05:50:06] <DEac-> seas: the bad guy should have made a backup of this object, i think. or kill him
[05:51:03] <seas> yeah..
[05:51:06] <Silex> DEac-: rails doesn't seem happy with it... it wants :person => { :items => [] }
[05:51:51] <Silex> well, in js it'd want { person: { items: [] }}
[05:54:01] <DEac-> Silex: you push json to your server?
[05:55:09] <Silex> DEac-: yes
[05:55:15] <DEac-> why you don't use serialize? it isn't json, but rails can handle your form. and it is down-compatible. formulars does not use json
[05:55:36] <Silex> DEac-: I'm using Spine.js, everything is json there
[05:56:02] <Silex> I'll try serialize() tho, maybe it works for the params
[05:56:13] <DEac-> for push? evil
[05:56:47] <DEac-> ok, json is cleaner than forms, but every server can handle that
[05:57:02] <Silex> DEac-: yeah it uses JSON.stringify for everything
[05:57:08] <markq> anyone using msgpack or have an opinion on using it over JSON?
[05:58:38] <Silex> DEac-: yeah, no it doens't work with serialize() because the request headers is application/json
[05:59:01] <Silex> anyway, I guess I'll have to manually parse the shit out of these html arrays and convert them to json
[05:59:16] <Silex> only found dumb loops on google that don't handle nested arrays very well
[06:02:22] <Cryp71c> Is there a non-hacky way to define custom events in the HTML of an element and then call that custom event from jquery/javascript?
[06:03:20] <Cryp71c> E.G. <input type="text" id="test" onSomeCustom="alert('test');" /> with javascript $('#test').bind('click', function() { $(this).trigger('onSomeCustom'); });
[06:03:34] <seas> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[06:03:37] <Cryp71c> (the above, of course, does not work since - afaik - trigger only works on the pre-existing events that are standard.
[06:03:55] <Cryp71c> seas, ...
[06:04:22] <seas> :P
[06:04:26] <Cryp71c> seas, I would rather you just not type anything than be retarded.
[06:04:33] <Cryp71c> tbh.
[06:06:07] <Silex> DEac-: thanks
[06:06:25] <Cryp71c> This is an example, but the top solution seems to be regarded as extremely hacky and not desirable at all. Its also a little old (5ish months?) : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7927419/custom-event-in-html-javascript

[06:15:44] <Zogot> Can anyone remember that jquery plugin that forces all elements to be next to each other, but also rearanges them if the screen gets smaller or a filter is chosen

[06:25:48] <rroelofs> Evelynn: I haven't used this plugin, but it seems to do what you want.  http://www.examplet.buss.hk/jquery/format.php
[06:26:54] <humanite> hello
[06:27:50] <Evelynn> rroelofs: yes, this could work
[06:30:33] <humanite> hope you can help me, i have a get request, when i want to call a function in the function of the get request, the function doesn't get called
[06:31:14] <rroelofs> eddd: there isn't a good way.  newer browsers support document.activeElement
[06:31:42] <eddd> rroelofs: thx for hint
[06:32:31] <humanite> the get request itself was successfull

[06:32:51] <bot-t> rroelofs, Couldn't find "jsfiddle @ humanite We're going to need to se code to have a prayer of being helpful" in jQuery Docs.
[06:33:04] <johnkpaul> :) oh bot-t
[06:33:42] <rroelofs> ?jsfiddle @ humanite
[06:33:42] <bot-t> humanite, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.

[06:44:33] <dannN> Hi there. I'm using jQuery and MooTools with the jQuery Plugin moo4q.com. I've an example postet here: http://pastebin.com/NiXqxNfd No i want to ask if there is a possibility to use this way without a selector. On DOM ready i want to already load the class to prepare some vars.
[06:45:44] <johnkpaul> dannN: I see your code, but I'm still confused about what you're asking
[06:47:54] <dannN> I want to use the MyClass in this way: var testObject = new MyClass(arg1, arg2, arg3); instead of $('#element').MyClass(arg1,arg2).
[06:48:14] <dannN> and the jQuery within the class should work too
[06:49:37] <johnkpaul> ok, so what is the problem with the code that you're writing? To be honest, I don't know much about the mootools class system, but there's nothing in jQuery stopping you from writing pure javascript around it
[06:50:52] <JuJuBee> Can someone explain the second part of the return statement in http://pastebin.com/8Nb3RHW7  ? what is the significance of the || 7 ?
[06:51:39] <johnkpaul> JuJuBee: || 7 is saying that if date.getDay() is falsy then replace it with the alue 7
[06:51:41] <johnkpaul> value*
[06:52:05] <johnkpaul> I don't know what you mean by the second part, the outcome is return {selectable: Boolean)
[06:52:16] <JuJuBee> you answered it.  Thanks...
[06:52:50] <johnkpaul> no problem
[06:55:23] <MagmaRules> Guys anyone has any idea why this example of ui layout is fluid inside the dialog: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/layout_inside_dialog.html and i cannot achieve the same result when resizing he window?
[06:57:28] <johnkpaul> MagmaRules: because it isn't written that way
[06:58:05] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul:  even if i put an "resize" in the window and apply the resizeAll its painfully slow. Why is the dialog so fluid ?
[06:58:29] <johnkpaul> it's written to resize the children when the dialog resizes
[06:59:17] <johnkpaul> look in firebug/dev tools
[06:59:25] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: yes i know i made the same example but added the following: $(window).resize(function() { pageLayout.resizeAll(); });
[06:59:28] <johnkpaul> as you resize, you can see the widh shrinking and other things happening
[07:00:14] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't see a global called pageLayout
[07:00:48] <johnkpaul> also, resize is fired way too much, if that's working, and is just freezing up your ui, you might want to look into debounce
[07:00:50] <johnkpaul> ?debounce
[07:00:51] <bot-t> Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[07:01:24] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: i created it, the thing is: I have "realtime" resize, but the browser resizing gets painfully slow, in firefox.
[07:01:44] <johnkpaul> are you attaching to the window's resize event?
[07:01:55] <johnkpaul> if so, you need to debounce that, and it'll be a lot faster
[07:02:01] <johnkpaul> resize happens every milliseconds
[07:02:24] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: ok ty, ill look into it =)
[07:02:32] <johnkpaul> np, have fun
[07:08:11] <supermanjnk> Question: If I have an element with multiple form fields (input, select, textarea, etc) is there a way for me to select the first element regardless of what it is. but there might be other things in front of those elements (like divs and spans) that I don't want to select
[07:08:36] <johnkpaul> supermanjnk: $("input,select,textarea,etc").first()
[07:08:59] <supermanjnk> johnkpaul: hmm didn't even think about that, was trying :first, thanks
[07:09:13] <johnkpaul> supermanjnk: no problem
[07:13:46] <mszola> I want to talk to someone about jQuery.getScript to make sure I understand how it works. Has anyone here used it?
[07:14:40] <ssj> umm wat wud be the best js popbox script?
[07:14:43] <ssj> any recommendations?
[07:22:35] <mszola> nobody has used getScript, then? I'm having a problem with an animation. the animation was done in Hype. I've been able to reproduce all the other ones done in Hype, but this one is just too complicated because not only does it size and move, it rotates a little.
[07:22:47] <mszola> So the problem with Hype is that it's set up to just load and run.
[07:22:50] <mszola> and the end.
[07:23:28] <mszola> I can't access the object from my script, it's not there, so I can't just call the object to run the script again when that particular animation is visible.
[07:24:05] <mszola> I hoped to use getScript to fetch the script to run the animation, but it loads and doesn't execute, so I wondered if I misunderstood how getScript worked.
[07:32:02] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul:  by any chance do you know if anyone tried porting http://methvin.com/splitter/ to 1.7? Seems to work pretty fluidly and has the features i need, don't need 90% of what ui layout offers me =/
[07:32:27] <johnkpaul> sadly, I have no idea
[07:32:35] <MagmaRules> oh well =)
[07:40:16] <Beelsebob> hey ho, is there any way to distinquish between a key down and key repeat event?
[07:40:24] <Beelsebob> (I keep getting key downs for the repeats)
[07:48:46] <Arimil> Does .change() trigger on a file input if the user changes it to a file with the same filename?
[07:49:33] <Brodingo_> ?tias
[07:49:48] <Brodingo_> >:|
[07:50:22] <mszola> Arimil, yes, I think so.
[07:50:46] <mszola> Because you did an action, you hit the button again regardless of the file you selected.
[07:51:00] <mszola> if you can't catch it on change, try giving the button an id and do onclick
[07:52:05] <mszola> To those who may have read my original question, I figured out what was going on with the Hype script. It was wrapped in an anonymous function thus I didn't have access to any of it.
[07:52:25] <mszola> I took out the anonymous function wrapper and lo and behold it is mine to command.
[07:52:42] <sunbeam> when i want to use Myriad Pro as a font for usage for <p> text (5-10 sentences). Do I have to import it with @font-face?
[07:53:28] <mszola> sunbeam if you want that specific font for all users, yes.
[07:53:46] <mszola> it's pretty common but last I checked isn't an "offical" web font.
[07:56:28] <sunbeam> mszola: yep i figured that
[07:56:38] <sunbeam> i just thought it wasn't a real proper practice
[07:56:47] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys
[07:56:53] <mszola> it IS pretty common, so you might just do font-family and the few who don't have it can take their lumps. :D
[07:56:54] <sunbeam> to use @font-face for paragraphs
[07:56:54] <aclockworkpeter> so I'm working with this example
[07:56:56] <aclockworkpeter> http://pastie.org/3733402
[07:57:01] <mszola> do it in your css
[07:57:04] <mszola> make a class.
[07:57:29] <aclockworkpeter> my question is... why does $("#bar") get me a b c d
[07:58:26] <mszola> sunbeam, this is good.
[07:58:27] <mszola> http://sixrevisions.com/css/font-face-guide/
[07:58:35] <NoiseEee> aclockworkpeter: i don't believe you, recreate that on jsfiddle
[07:58:36] <mszola> What you do is you put in the font-face command to your css
[07:58:43] <aclockworkpeter> i just did
[07:58:46] <mszola> then you make your class and call the desired font
[07:59:13] <sunbeam> mszola: ok thjnx
[07:59:19] <aclockworkpeter> http://jsfiddle.net/aclockworkpeter/dRpMY/
[07:59:33] <mszola> :) sunbeam

[08:49:12] <ccmonster> drr
[08:51:37] <Ring0`> Hi. http://jsfiddle.net/xXn35/ Why after click ('active' class is added) jQuery ingores .not()?
[08:52:14] <AddeBC> Hi i have a problem...the weird thing the code worked a year ago...   I have Page1 that runs an ajax result to <div id="res"
[08:52:16] <AddeBC> >
[08:53:16] <AddeBC> Sorr hit enter by misttake... In the result i have div ids which i try to access from Page1 function with $('#title')
[08:53:16] <ccmonster> maybe you want to do a hasClass('active') check
[08:53:19] <ccmonster> to determine your logic
[08:54:01] <AddeBC> now i am only getting undefined
[08:55:19] <AddeBC> $('#title').innerHTML  <-- undefined
[08:55:40] <demetan> i need some help about $.post and the call back function
[08:56:09] <ccmonster> fiddle it demetan
[08:56:16] <faraway> Ring0`: jQuery does not "ignore" the .not() .. it is just not used … you apply to the hover callback to the elements that match the query. what you are looking for is the .on functionality. or you remove the .not() and to a check in the callback functions itself
[08:57:35] <demetan> ccmonster : $.post('coo.php','name',function(data){alert(eval(data)});
[08:58:15] <demetan> data is an json object : echo json_encode($coo);
[08:58:19] <Druid_> Half a million Macs have a virus. People were lined up for hours to be the first to get infected.
[08:59:03] <Ring0`> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/xXn35/1/ I tried with .on, am I doing it wrong?
[08:59:48] <faraway> Ring0`: yes you do it wrong ;)
[08:59:50] <Ring0`> :(
[09:00:06] <faraway> Ring0`: one moment ;)
[09:00:46] <ccmonster> demetan, jsfiddle.net
[09:00:50] <ccmonster> do a demo there
[09:00:55] <ccmonster> its much easier than pasting line by line
[09:01:10] <demetan> ok tx
[09:01:23] <faraway> Ring0`: http://jsfiddle.net/xXn35/2/
[09:01:41] <AddeBC> hmmm. i ran an alert($('#result'))  and it returns that its an object but if i add .innerHTML it returns undefined... Is there something changed since jq 1.3.2 i just updated to 1.7.1
[09:01:43] <faraway> Ring0`: but really, you should learn how the selectors work ;)
[09:02:25] <Ring0`> faraway: it was that .not() was tirggered before .on ?
[09:02:29] <Ring0`> that's why it didn't work?
[09:03:36] <faraway> Ring0`: yeah … you get back a list of elements that match the li.menu without the on that have .active to this you added the callback
[09:03:58] <Ring0`> I seee. Thanks a ton faraway !
[09:04:08] <ccmonster> hey faraway , any chance you can help me with my slidedown tabs really quick? http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/CLqjz/
[09:04:09] <faraway> Ring0`: the callback is not touched if you change the class later. if you want to active this you need to use the .on
[09:04:12] <demetan> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/SYF5G/
[09:05:13] <Ring0`> One more faraway. Why you had to use ('body').on(); why couldn't it be the li.menu?
[09:05:24] <faraway> Ring0`:  the .on is easier to maintain, but performance is imho better if you use hover and do a check in your callbacks if the class active is set
[09:05:28] <Ring0`> or it could be any parent object?
[09:05:40] <Ring0`> faraway: oh i see.
[09:05:57] <ccmonster> demetan, you probably dont need to put the php in the HTML section. just put a json string in your js and reference it.
[09:06:14] <ccmonster> your more worried about the data, and handling it correctly, right? or is there a diff piece youre more concerned with at this moment?
[09:06:58] <faraway> Ring0`: the selector you add in the .on part takes the $(…)  as relative "root"
[09:07:26] <Ring0`> mmk..
[09:10:01] <demetan> ccmonster there is no php in the html, just a post. how I can put a json string and reference it ? It works great in Ajax "old school", but I can't do it in Jquery : function go(){ var xhr .....
[09:10:45] <ccmonster> ok
[09:10:52] <ccmonster> ? .getJSON
[09:10:52] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[09:11:02] <ccmonster> check that out demetan
[09:11:15] <demetan> thx ccmonster I check
[09:11:50] <ccmonster> what is nomCommune?
[09:11:52] <ccmonster> city Name?
[09:11:57] <ccmonster> is that a variable?
[09:12:20] <faraway> Ring0`: to understand the .on thing you probably need to look at how DOM events are handled in javascript, its worth to learn otherwise you will always have problems
[09:12:26] <ccmonster> demetan, http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/SYF5G/1/
[09:13:26] <csdco> I'm getting #Object has no method 'live'. But how is that even possible?
[09:13:32] <csdco> This is the code: $('.myclass').live('click', function(e) {} );
[09:14:33] <ccmonster> um. what version of jquery are you using?
[09:16:12] <demetan> ccmonster : jquery-1.7.2.min.js
[09:16:12] <Zzaichik> csdco:  As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use http://api.jquery.com/on/ to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ in preference to .live().
[09:16:20] <csdco> 1.4.1
[09:17:04] <ccmonster> i didn't realize they killed live. that sucks
[09:17:13] <ccmonster> haha
[09:17:14] <csdco> Okay I see the problem. This is on an existing Drupal 6 website and on the particular page it's using the core jQuery version of 1.2 as opposed to the 1.4 version that other pages are using. I'll get this working.
[09:17:16] <Zzaichik> they replaced it with something better
[09:17:19] <csdco> You pointed me in the right direction, thanks :)
[09:17:23] <ccmonster> yea, i remember hearing about .on()
[09:17:36] <ccmonster> just didn't realize they'd deprecated .live officially already
[09:17:52] <ccmonster> .on makes more sense semantically as well
[09:17:57] <csdco> Yea when I first read that I was surprised. Thought it was what I was "supposed" to be using.
[09:18:01] <Zzaichik> ^^
[09:18:19] <ccmonster> what's the ^^ for?
[09:18:36] <Zzaichik> that means amen, brother!
[09:18:43] <ccmonster> haha.
[09:19:07] <Zzaichik> I was referring to what you were saying, ccmonster
[09:19:10] <Zzaichik> haha
[09:19:25] <ccmonster> oh, it popped up after and under csdco's line, so i was confuzzled
[09:19:26] <ccmonster> lol
[09:19:27] <ccmonster> :)
[09:19:37] <Zzaichik> Yeah I know. I'm a little slow this morning
[09:19:39] <Zzaichik> lol
[09:19:47] <ccmonster> no worries. what's the time there? wherever you are?
[09:19:56] <Zzaichik> 10am
[09:20:03] <Randomage> I'm making a super lightweight replacement for the "required" attribute in IE, I'm stuck at the point in which I should select the inputs that should be full but aren't.

[09:20:14] <Zzaichik> not too bad, but I'm a night person.
[09:20:22] <ccmonster> where you at?
[09:20:23] <Randomage> Basically I need to refine the selection at line 5
[09:20:25] <Zzaichik> UT
[09:20:29] <ccmonster> ah cool.
[09:20:32] <ccmonster> mormon country.
[09:20:33] <Zzaichik> totally cool
[09:20:37] <Zzaichik> yep, exactly. haha
[09:20:43] <ccmonster> you's a mormon yourself?
[09:20:44] <Zzaichik> these lands are overrun
[09:20:46] <Zzaichik> negative
[09:20:59] <ccmonster> haha. just a random question
[09:21:12] <ccmonster> my favorite mormon reference is M.A.V.
[09:21:14] <Randomage> Any clue?
[09:21:18] <Zzaichik> haha - its all good.
[09:21:24] <Zzaichik> MAV?
[09:21:30] <Zzaichik> Randomage: I'll take a look
[09:21:32] <ccmonster> mormon assault vehicle. shit makes me laugh every time. was told that one by a mormon as well, which makes it funnier
[09:21:37] <Randomage> It's kinda easy for text inputs, but I have no ideas for checkboxes and radios
[09:21:46] <Zzaichik> baahahah
[09:21:52] <ccmonster> i guess it's a reference to their VERY heavy missionary ways
[09:22:26] <ccmonster> or Tuesday Beverage Club
[09:22:27] <Zzaichik> Yeah I thought of minivans when you said that
[09:22:45] <ccmonster> apparently they do lots of 'beverages' and tuesday is a common social night for mormons or something
[09:22:54] <ccmonster> 'you a member of the tuesday beverage club' ?
[09:22:58] <ccmonster> anyway, i digress
[09:23:05] <Zzaichik> haha -  crazy
[09:23:13] <Zzaichik> first time I've heard of that one too. haha
[09:23:16] <Zzaichik> I am seriously out of the loop

[09:24:10] <ccmonster> answer: a basement full of canned goods
[09:24:19] <imanc> ha ha
[09:24:22] <imanc> thanks ccmonster
[09:24:23] <kringj> hey all, do you mind if i ask a question about an odd issue i'm having with .post?
[09:24:34] <ccmonster> I guess they horde canned goods for the reckoning.
[09:24:37] <imanc> I thought you were going to say Mitt Romney
[09:24:45] <ccmonster> haha. that would have been good too
[09:24:47] <ASUChander> lenswipe whichever you prefer
[09:24:56] <ccmonster> i might use that one as we get closer to election time :)
[09:25:01] <imanc> haha
[09:25:13] <ccmonster> when im really trying to get under the skin of someone.
[09:25:19] <ccmonster> all for my own personal enjoyment of course.
[09:26:22] <kringj> when this gets called on localhost, everything goes just fine: https://gist.github.com/83089b752dd2efce56d7
[09:26:30] <kringj> however in production there is about a 1 minute delay
[09:26:34] <kringj> between the server responding
[09:26:40] <kringj> and the respond function being called
[09:26:45] <kringj> other than that, it works just fine
[09:26:48] <imanc> this accordian doesn't look like it can work horizontally hm
[09:26:59] <kringj> any idea why there would be a delay in production, but not locally?
[09:33:39] <coachz> hi, anyone up on jqgrid?  I"m looking for a datagrid that can expand sections for relational info,  a table in a table if you will  http://www.trirand.net/demophp.aspx
[09:34:24] <coachz> oh crap it does it, sweet, nvm
[09:36:36] <ccmonster> imanc, i'm almost positive the accordian can go horizontal
[09:37:28] <ccmonster> imanc, http://jsfiddle.net/CoolEsh/8LNkG/6/
[09:38:19] <imanc> cheers ccmonster
[09:39:28] <ccmonster> imanc, also check out : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/horizontal-accordion-15-10-2011
[09:45:33] <kringj> weird! simply by turning the status code from 201 (created) to 200 (success) the delay disappeared. wtf!?
[09:46:37] <ccmonster> that is odd
[09:46:44] <ccmonster> see if there is a known bug for status codes like that
[09:48:42] <kringj> k
[09:53:40] <kringj> doesn't seem to be a known bug
[09:54:11] <kringj> it kind of makes sense, throttling create requests, but it certainly doesn't seem like jquery's responsibility
[09:55:36] <Agamemnus> If $(#send_email) is a checkbox, how do I get its value?
[09:55:49] <Agamemnus> $("#send_email").val() gives me undefined if it is unchecked
[09:56:30] <LordThumper> $("#send_email").is(":checked")
[09:56:35] <LordThumper> return bool
[09:56:36] <Agamemnus> thank you
[10:00:48] <Blaster> hey guys... when I do my Ajax call, I have a callback function with a data argument.  I'm doing console.log(data) and it's returning {"success":"true"} but when I do console.log(data.success); it says undefined.  Any ideas?
[10:02:27] <Agamemnus> LordThumper: that doesn't work.
[10:02:32] <Agamemnus> It always returns false
[10:03:19] <Blaster> Nvm, had the wrong dataType on my Ajax call
[10:05:07] <Agamemnus> never mind
[10:05:10] <Agamemnus> ugh
[10:10:23] <UItabs> Is there any reason why Tabs return false on click events even if usability keys (e.g. shift/ctrl) are pressed along with the click?
[10:21:43] <Dexec> Gentlemen, I'm using .dialog() and it's all going good, but the problem I'm having is that when I apply .dialog() to a div, it seems to wipe out all the attributes already set on that div including the ID. Is that the expected behaviour?
[10:22:11] <Dexec> If so, then how am I supposed to reference the div when I want to call .dialog('close') on it?
[10:26:49] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to do a cross domain post to a subdomain of the domain that my js is being served from. Is the only way to handle this to use an iframe?
[10:40:32] <xenaxon> $('.body-bg-image').load(
[10:40:48] <xenaxon> is not firing up
[10:40:49] <xenaxon> and I have loaded images with that class, I can see them in the browser
[10:41:12] <xenaxon> I can see them in the browser(being loaded) and the jquery load function is not firing up
[10:45:40] <iarfen> Hi!!
[10:46:03] <iarfen> How I can execute a function each time the DOM add elements??? When the document "changes"
[10:49:20] <Pilate> iarfen: add an event listener to the document for mutation events
[10:51:14] <iarfen> Pilate: there isn't a jquery method???
[10:51:38] <iarfen> Pilate: do you have an example? I have the W3c page of mutation events but it's a little hard to understand it xD
[10:53:27] <Pilate> perhaps learning javascript would help
[10:54:19] <xenaxon> why doesn't $('.body-bg-image').load( work?
[10:54:28] <xenaxon> i have 3 images with that class on them
[10:54:53] <xenaxon> and I can see them with my own eyes load, in the browser, but the .load event doesn't fire up
[10:55:03] <jita> is there a better way to do this ? http://dpaste.org/OtVCv/ ?
[10:55:10] <blindMoe> xenaxon: read the docs for $.load()
[10:55:27] <blindMoe> "Description: Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element."
[10:55:33] <jita> Can i do that with single lass selector ?
[10:55:42] <xenaxon> blindMoe: I did
[10:56:26] <blindMoe> xenaxon: you should probably pastebin or jsfiddle your entire line of code so people don't have to guess what you are attempting to do
[10:58:59] <xenaxon> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/Gan3p/
[10:59:03] <xenaxon> this is the code
[10:59:05] <abnormalex> can I intertwine a jquery loop with php?
[10:59:17] <abnormalex> if (isset($_GET['menu']) && $_GET['menu'] == jQueryItteration)
[10:59:34] <blindMoe> xenaxon: what docs did you read about .load() .. I think you read something different than I did
[10:59:38] <blindMoe> "Description: Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element."
[10:59:43] <abnormalex> i want to check each _GET vairable against my jquery loop
[10:59:43] <abnormalex> $($allMenus).each(function(i) {
[10:59:44] <blindMoe> that is what the docs I saw say about .load
[11:00:58] <blindMoe> xenaxon: I would guess that your javascript console has some errors in it as well
[11:01:04] <xenaxon> blindMoe, I have no idea what you've read
[11:01:15] <blindMoe> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:01:35] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/Gan3p/1/
[11:01:37] <blindMoe> xenaxon: read the first sentence on that page
[11:01:58] <xenaxon> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:02:20] <supsup> first param of .load is a url not a function.
[11:02:31] <blindMoe> xenaxon: interesting
[11:03:12] <xenaxon> from what I see, supsup the official website's example uses the same code I used
[11:03:16] <xenaxon> and it doesn't work for me
[11:03:23] <xenaxon> $('#book').load(function() {
[11:03:23] <xenaxon> });
[11:03:40] <supsup> where is example at
[11:03:57] <xenaxon> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:04:00] <abnormalex> must use jquery variable in php
[11:04:15] <supsup> oh i ws using other .load
[11:04:16] <abnormalex> if (isset($_GET['menu']) && $_GET['menu'] == JQUERY-VARIABLE-HERE)
[11:04:34] <xenaxon> supsup blindMoe, something is clearly not working
[11:04:40] <xenaxon> and it aint a code mistake
[11:05:45] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: your code is wrong
[11:05:56] <ryanneufeld> unless you're trying to bind to the load event of an image
[11:06:01] <xenaxon> ??
[11:06:05] <blindMoe> xenaxon: yeah it is an interesting one... kind of curious what you find out
[11:06:12] <xenaxon> yes, I am
[11:06:20] <xenaxon> check the code
[11:06:43] <xenaxon> I'm trying to add each image to the loaded Images array, when each image is loaded
[11:06:55] <xenaxon> but the load event doesn't fire up in jquery
[11:06:58] <supsup> well u have the images hidden
[11:07:01] <xenaxon> and it's clearly doing so in the browser
[11:07:08] <supsup> maybe the load happens then and the image is cached
[11:07:12] <supsup> so it don't load no mo
[11:07:21] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: something in your code is hiding the image
[11:07:23] <supsup> well nm
[11:07:27] <xenaxon> ... clear the hide event, and it's still not working
[11:07:31] <xenaxon> :)
[11:07:36] <ryanneufeld> when you remove your JS then your images show up
[11:07:42] <ryanneufeld> so you have a problem in your code
[11:07:43] <ryanneufeld> and also
[11:07:47] <warrenparsons> supsup: Browser cache won't prevent a load event from firing.
[11:07:49] <ryanneufeld> don't use setInterval
[11:07:55] <ryanneufeld> use setTimeout and pass it a functin
[11:08:02] <ryanneufeld> then have that function do a new setTimeout
[11:08:11] <ryanneufeld> then you can control it in code
[11:08:11] <abnormalex> hey I really need help understanding how to do this
[11:08:19] <abnormalex> I need LOOP-VARIABLE to come from the following
[11:08:22] <abnormalex> $.get('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenus', function(data) {
[11:08:22] <abnormalex> 			var $allMenus = jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[11:08:36] <xenaxon> ryanneufeld: I'm not sure what you're saying, but the fact is the .load event is not firing up
[11:08:38] <abnormalex> and then i have some <?php
[11:08:39] <abnormalex> if (isset($_GET['menu']) && $_GET['menu'] == LOOP-VARIABLE)
[11:08:42] <xenaxon> so it has nothing to do with setInterval
[11:08:51] <xenaxon> delete the whole thing and leave only the .load, and still nothing
[11:09:18] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ load
[11:09:18] <bot-t> load, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:09:22] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ xenaxon
[11:09:22] <bot-t> xenaxon, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:09:37] <abnormalex> does any1 understand what im trying to do?
[11:09:57] <warrenparsons> abnormalex: Are you trying to interleave a PHP loop with a JS loop?
[11:11:10] <xenaxon> ryanneufeld: can you modify the code?
[11:11:35] <xenaxon> I'm not sure what you're trying to point out
[11:11:49] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: use .on() instead of .load()
[11:11:59] <ryanneufeld> also look into the caveats of load events
[11:13:19] <warrenparsons> xenaxon: It's probably failing because you're trying to watch the load event of multiple objects.
[11:13:19] <abnormalex> warrenparsons: i suppose, until i learn the correct way of what im trying to do
[11:13:55] <warrenparsons> abnormalex: Since PHP is executed on the server before anything is sent to the browser, while JS is executed in the browser, what you're trying to do is not likely to work.
[11:14:20] <xenaxon> warrenparsons: you think?
[11:14:28] <xenaxon> but I need to do that. It's the exact purpose of it
[11:14:43] <xenaxon> I need to watch the load event of each element in that class and fire the load event
[11:15:05] <warrenparsons> xenaxon: You could instead watch the parent container's load event, and when it fires, store your images then.
[11:15:25] <xenaxon> ?
[11:15:36] <xenaxon> the parent container is body
[11:15:37] <jettero> I'm looking for an effect rather like draggable, but insted of dragging the actual div, it drags some little icon ...
[11:15:45] <xenaxon> but I need to fire it up every time each image loads
[11:15:55] <xenaxon> because I need to add that image to array
[11:16:03] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/Gan3p/4/
[11:21:03] <warrenparsons> xenaxon: Try http://jsfiddle.net/Gan3p/8/
[11:22:13] <warrenparsons> xenaxon: The whole problem was you had jsfiddle set to execute when the page's load event fires, which of course is after your content's load event. Chaning it to domready fixed it.
[11:22:48] <xenaxon> yeah, I figured it myself in the mean time
[11:23:06] <stalecache> Anyone else experiencing a JavaScript error with twitter's main search?: https://twitter.com/#!/search/Testing
[11:24:15] <abnormalex> http://pastie.org/3734436
[11:24:21] <abnormalex> please help me figure this small pastie out
[11:24:36] <abnormalex> need to check ????????? against each menuName returned by jquery ajax
[11:26:05] <scribe> Hey guys.  I'm running into something very frustrating with Jquery.  It's trying to be too nice to me.
[11:26:07] <scribe> :)
[11:26:36] <scribe> I'm issuing an .ajax get call and want the text response, even if the mime type is xml.
[11:26:43] <xenaxon> warrenparsons: good fix on jsfiddle but no cigar, it's not working on my live site
[11:26:43] <scribe> I've set converters to {}
[11:27:02] <scribe> and I still get a [Document] returned
[11:27:13] <scribe> I simply want the text.
[11:27:28] <scribe> I don't want jQuery to parse anything
[11:27:41] <scribe> How do I simply get the raw text of the response from my .get?
[11:28:54] <alexr2> scribe, the data you're sending in, or the data you're getting back?
[11:29:20] <Zeelot3k> hey guys... I have a parent and child div that I am showing and hiding using jquery show()/hide() functions...if the child div is hidden using hide('fast') instead of hide(), then calling show() on the parent will actually show the child div as well, anyone know why?
[11:29:50] <alexr2> Zeelot3k -> http://jsfiddle.net
[11:29:50] <scribe> alexr2, the data I'm getting back.
[11:29:58] <Zeelot3k> alexr2: working on it
[11:29:59] <alexr2> scribe: dataType : html
[11:32:42] <scribe> alexr2, you're my hero!  Thank you so much!
[11:32:59] <scribe> alexr2, I've spend forever trying to figure this out.
[11:38:55] <VioByte> http://imgur.com/FloYe i'm trying to achieve this result, Any idea how? or is there any jquery plugins that mimic this?
[11:42:52] <oyvindmalin> Any good ideas on how i can get e.g child 5-10 of a jquery object?
[11:43:09] <oyvindmalin> given $("#mycontainer").children("div");
[11:44:16] <supsup> ? :gt
[11:44:17] <bot-t> :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[11:44:28] <supsup> ? :lt
[11:44:29] <bot-t> :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[11:46:28] <abnormalex> why doesnt this work
[11:46:32] <abnormalex> $(".menu").click(function() {
[11:46:32] <abnormalex> 			alert("po");
[11:46:44] <supsup> prob u have it before .menu exists
[11:46:54] <NoiseEee> i give up what does your console say?
[11:47:22] <abnormalex> my consolse says nothing
[11:48:27] <techouse> any idea why $.fancybox(myDocumentFragment) works, but $.fancybox({content:myDocumentFragment}) doesn't?
[11:48:38] <oyvindmalin> abnormalex: try using .live('click', function () { blabla });
[11:48:46] <oyvindmalin> worked in most cases for me
[11:48:51] <abnormalex> eh sorry my php header was refreshing the page before it could alert
[11:50:49] <abnormalex> well that doesnt work either
[11:50:51] <abnormalex> $(".menu").click(function(e) {
[11:50:51] <abnormalex> 			e.preventDefault();
[11:54:06] <abnormalex> theres seomthing odd going on
[11:54:08] <abnormalex> the alert wont happen
[11:54:08] <abnormalex> http://pastie.org/3734580
[11:54:44] <alexr2> abnormalex, the .click event is set on page load (before your $.get call returns anything
[11:54:45] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: (02:46:42 PM) supsup: prob u have it before .menu exists
[11:55:07] <abnormalex> oh i see, good call
[11:55:11] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: otherwise, recreate on JS fiddle
[11:55:15] <abnormalex> i need the click event to go inside document.ready?
[11:55:30] <alexr2> no, you need it to occur after your ajax call is complete
[11:55:37] <alexr2> and that loop completes
[11:56:05] <abnormalex> ok, so in a callback ?
[11:56:27] <oyvindmalin> supsup: thanks... i found the $.slice() and it worked like i wanted it to
[11:56:40] <alexr2> abnormalex, use .on
[11:56:53] <alexr2> ? on
[11:56:54] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:57:03] <supsup> cool yah thats better ~
[11:57:51] <abnormalex> on is not making a difference
[11:57:59] <abnormalex> $(".menu").on("click", function(event){
[11:58:00] <abnormalex> 			alert("nig");
[11:58:15] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: you're trying to get an alert of 'nig' when the menu is clicked?
[11:58:19] <abnormalex> yes
[11:58:25] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: yes, put that in your document ready handler
[11:58:25] <abnormalex> any .menu
[11:58:29] <abnormalex> ok
[11:58:54] <alexr2> $('#allMenus').on('click','.menu',function() { alert("here") });
[11:59:17] <abnormalex> darn
[11:59:17] <abnormalex> http://pastie.org/3734610
[11:59:23] <abnormalex> hm
[11:59:50] <abnormalex> that is working alex
[12:01:07] <abnormalex> i need to store clicked .html in  a var
[12:01:18] <abnormalex> except i need a div inside clicked .menu
[12:01:28] <abnormalex> .menu has <span class="menuID"
[12:01:35] <abnormalex> i need to get that value, from clicked .menu
[12:01:49] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net
[12:01:59] <alexr2> much easier to see what you want to do that way
[12:03:18] <abnormalex> http://jsfiddle.net/xJPKV/
[12:03:28] <abnormalex> specificy, just need to modify  alert($(this).(".menuID").html());
[12:03:45] <alexr2> Put in html of what it'll look like as well (after your $.get call completes)
[12:03:50] <Chitz> Is there an alternate way to get TypeWriter like effect on text without using setTimeOut or setInterval?
[12:04:24] <abnormalex> aha
[12:04:31] <abnormalex> alert($(this).children('.menuID').html());
[12:05:13] <shr_nyk> I have checkboxes. I mark it as checked and then click a button. This is directed to a function inside which I m checking how many checkboxes are checked.
[12:06:03] <shr_nyk> var str = 'input[id=adcart'+i+']';
[12:06:18] <shr_nyk> var isChecked = $(str).is(':checked')
[12:06:49] <shr_nyk> though I have 'checked' a few check boxes, it always gives me false.
[12:06:57] <alexr2> $('input:checkbox:checked').length
[12:08:09] <shr_nyk> i want to check if a particular checkbox is checked or not.
[12:08:34] <alexr2> then do $(selector).prop('checked')
[12:08:38] <alexr2> returns true or false
[12:08:55] <shr_nyk> yeah tried that.. says .prop is not a function :(
[12:09:07] <alexr2> what version of jquery are you using?
[12:10:05] <shr_nyk> 1.4
[12:10:14] <alexr2> prop was added in 1.6
[12:10:17] <abnormalex> can I pass data to my php script with ajax, or only from?
[12:10:17] <supsup> oyvindmalin: random http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-eq-gt
[12:10:22] <alexr2> you should update jquery anyway
[12:10:36] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: of course with ajax/xhr
[12:13:58] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: var $id = '1';      $.post('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenus', $id);
[12:14:28] <abnormalex> that looks accurate?
[12:16:13] <abnormalex> seems to work
[12:17:05] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: if you're starting out using jquery, use the modern way.
[12:17:20] <thebignoise> can someone tell me what is wrong with this.
[12:17:21] <thebignoise> http://pastebin.com/ArPYgPc2
[12:17:44] <thebignoise> it returns nothing until i remove the dataType.
[12:17:51] <thebignoise> it then returns, but just returns a string
[12:18:30] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: whats the modern way?
[12:18:50] <abnormalex> $.post('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenu', $clickedMenuID, function(returnedData) {
[12:20:04] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: something like var xhr = $.ajax({url:'scripts/menus.php?func=getMenus',type:'post',data:{menuID:id}});  xhr.done(function(data) { //do something with data returned });   http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:20:22] <abnormalex> i see
[12:20:29] <abnormalex> is .post .get etc being deprecated?
[12:21:02] <xenaxon> how to echo only SRC of full-size the_post_thumbnail
[12:21:23] <xenaxon> I have the post thumbnail in 50x50 and want to echo the url of the full-size original image
[12:21:33] <xenaxon> how can you do that?
[12:22:38] <supsup> abnormalex u should just always use .ajax for .post .get imo.
[12:23:18] <abnormalex> oh
[12:23:21] <supsup> the others were just shortcuts...pointless imo
[12:23:27] <supsup> makes it harder to read
[12:23:31] <supsup> personal prefs tho
[12:24:31] <abnormalex> ill rearrange it in a sec, but it doesnt seem to call the scipr
[12:24:33] <abnormalex> script
[12:24:41] <abnormalex> this happens on click
[12:24:42] <abnormalex> $.post('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenu', $clickedMenuID, function(returnedData) {
[12:25:06] <abnormalex> and in that sciprt, this should happen

[12:25:40] <johnkpaul> abnormalex: you're posting to a url with get parameters?

[12:27:02] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: you're specifying 'post', but you're looking in $_GET
[12:27:04] <johnkpaul> abnormalex: you _can_ but in that example, there are no get parameters

[12:27:35] <johnkpaul> one day, bot-t, one day
[12:27:57] <abnormalex> hmm
[12:28:05] <abnormalex> so it needs to say $_POST
[12:29:03] <digitalfiz> why would $(this).attr('value') work but not $(this).val()?
[12:29:09] <Robbo_> does anyone know how to resize something manually after making it resizable?
[12:29:32] <johnkpaul> digitalfiz: is it an input?
[12:29:36] <NoiseEee> digitalfiz: it "this" a form element?
[12:30:28] <digitalfiz> johnkpaul, NoiseEee its a textarea
[12:30:52] <abnormalex> ok my only problem now is accessing the data send with ajax, in php
[12:32:20] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: something like var xhr = $.ajax({url:'scripts/menus.php?func=getMenus',type:'post',data:{menuID:id}});
[12:32:37] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: <?php echo "holy cow, the passed id was ".$_POST['menuID']; ?>
[12:33:19] <appserver> hi
[12:33:23] <abnormalex> x$.get('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenu', data:{menuID:$clickedMenuID}, function(returnedData) {
[12:33:34] <appserver> is there a website u guys use to test jquery?
[12:33:43] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: and in that case, it would be in $_GET
[12:33:55] <johnkpaul> digitalfiz: I don't know, that's very odd
[12:33:57] <abnormalex> and in my php:
[12:33:58] <abnormalex> $menuID = filter_var($_GET['menuID'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
[12:34:00] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: might be worth it to brush up your PHP and your javascript before making things long and barely understanding
[12:34:01] <appserver> is there a website u guys use to test jquery?
[12:34:32] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: i dont know a better way than to keep practicing, were almost there i appreciate ur help :)
[12:34:40] <gnarf> appserver: what do you mean "test jquery" ?
[12:34:48] <gnarf> ?jsfiddle @appserver
[12:34:49] <bot-t> appserver, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.

[12:36:10] <interopcop> so far I have learned how to hide/show a div based on a click of a link or a div with an id.  But I can't figure out how to do it for several links or div's in a document.  For example, if you have 20 posts, and you want a hidden div beneath each post containing a form, and you want a "hide/show" link - how does that work?  Here's what I'm working on: http://jsfiddle.net/7sdM3/1/  If you've seen a tutorial on tihs exact thing, I'd be much ob
[12:38:29] <abnormalex> nice, i guess with .get / .post you dont need data:{data
[12:38:39] <abnormalex> $.get('scripts/menus.php?func=getMenu', {menuID:$clickedMenuID}, function(returnedData) {
[12:39:12] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: remember when more than person advised using $.ajax and proper sending of a data parameter?
[12:39:36] <NoiseEee> if you're seeking help/advice, best be taking it.
[12:39:48] <NoiseEee> learn to do things the right/future-dependable way.
[12:40:03] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: yeah, but then i just got the impression its not being deprecated, and its the same alternative shortcut way of doing it
[12:40:18] <abnormalex>  / preference
[12:40:30] <NoiseEee> yeah, but then you don't have to " i guess " things
[12:40:37] <NoiseEee> since you are trying to learn, arent you?
[12:40:40] <abnormalex> yes
[12:40:43] <NoiseEee> or are you just trying to make something work?
[12:41:01] <NoiseEee> just... take the effort.
[12:41:01] <abnormalex> no i want to learn, but some1 said .ajax is generally prefered and more readable
[12:41:10] <NoiseEee> take/make
[12:41:11] <NoiseEee> bake/cake
[12:41:13] <abnormalex> but to me, seeing .post , .get, etc in my code, is more readable
[12:41:47] <supsup> how so... $.ajax says exactly what is going on. and then it has so many more ways to debug/customize
[12:42:12] <Dr4g> I load an iframe, and i'm trying to refer to DOM nodes in my iframe, but jquery returns blankness.
[12:42:14] <Dr4g> Thoughts ?
[12:42:27] <Dr4g> $('#myiframe').find('#someelement');
[12:42:30] <Dr4g> not working
[12:42:33] <abnormalex> $.ajax is generally better to use if you require a greater depth of configuration over your ajax request, however if you're only going to be using simple $.post requests in your scripts and applications, sticking to it may be the best idea.
[12:42:51] <NoiseEee> you need to get to the document loaded in your iframe Dr4g, not the iframe element itself
[12:42:52] <abnormalex> because in the first word of the first line i can see whats hpapening, vs reading into the function to find if its post or get
[12:43:03] <abnormalex> but if i start getting more complex, your right i need to use .ajax for more config
[12:43:19] <supsup> Dr4g is ur iframe source same domain?
[12:43:19] <Dr4g> NoiseEee: can you explain that in more detail? I didn't understand it
[12:43:28] <Dr4g> supsup: nope.
[12:43:31] <supsup> bam
[12:43:36] <NoiseEee> Dr4g: ahh well you're SOL then
[12:43:38] <NoiseEee> regardless
[12:43:40] <supsup> u can't do that hommie not without some hacks
[12:43:52] <Dr4g> NoiseEee: SOL = ?
[12:44:02] <NoiseEee> shit outta luck
[12:44:16] <Dr4g> supsup: why can't jQuery point to things loaded in my iframe
[12:44:18] <supsup> u can do it, look up ALex sextons iframe cross domain thing
[12:44:39] <supsup> but u would need to control bother servers
[12:44:46] <supsup> or know someoen willing to help u on the other server end
[12:44:52] <supsup> if thats not possible then you can't
[12:44:57] <gnarf> abnormalex: true, but if you use $.ajax it makes it easier to add other stuff into the options without having to switch it... I personally prefer using $.ajax always - but I also rarely have a $.ajax call that isn't abstracted into a function
[12:45:25] <abnormalex> i will learn to use .ajax
[12:45:34] <supsup> ? breaking cross domain
[12:45:35] <gnarf> in other words, I usually have something like server.getUserStatus({ userId: 2 }).done(...)

[12:45:57] <gnarf> ?jsisjs @abnormalex
[12:45:58] <bot-t> abnormalex, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.

[12:48:08] <bot-t> abnormalex, window.location - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location

[12:49:13] <abnormalex> document.location vs window.location?
[12:49:27] <Hereisanotherlie> if I'm following an older tutorial could I just swap out .bind and .live and replace it with .on?

[12:52:19] <NoiseEee> abnormalex: take a day or two and learn JS.  things will work out much better for you in the long run.
[12:52:23] <NoiseEee> best of luck.
[12:52:40] <Dr4g> NoiseEee: supsup are there any ways to have the document in the iframe go to another URL?
[12:52:53] <Dr4g> I don't own the other server.
[12:53:39] <abnormalex> NoiseEee: good idea. i think ill start with window.location

[12:56:15] <oyvindmalin> ngharo: lt in this case is slower than slice
[12:56:43] <Hereisanotherlie> and .delegate too can those all be replaced by .on?
[12:57:03] <ngharo> oyvindmalin: I don't think you can rely on the ordering of a jquery collection to match whats in the DOM

[13:43:25] <ngharo> interopcop: like this http://jsfiddle.net/7sdM3/2/

[13:46:32] <ticktock71> cwillu_at_work: Yes, but since they mashed them together, why leave them as two files (two HTTP requests for each damn client)?
[13:46:38] <solsTiCe> johnkpaul: ok. it was my setup
[13:47:01] <cwillu_at_work> ticktock71, huh?
[13:47:08] <cwillu_at_work> ticktock71, define "mashed them together"
[13:47:46] <ticktock71> cwillu_at_work: Well, all the needed UI modules.
[13:47:54] <ticktock71> Inside that minimal UI file. Only the stuff I need.
[13:48:05] <ticktock71> Maybe I can just copy and paste those files into my own file...
[13:48:13] <ticktock71> Still, it seems odd for them to distribute them as two files.
[13:48:35] <cwillu_at_work> jquery and jquery-ui are two different things
[13:48:40] <cwillu_at_work> the one uses the other
[13:48:45] <ticktock71> I know...
[13:48:51] <ticktock71> Did you look at the page?
[13:48:55] <cwillu_at_work> nope
[13:49:02] <ticktock71> Two files = one too many HTTP requests.
[13:49:09] <ticktock71> So I guess I can just copy and paste them into a new .js...
[13:49:10] <cwillu_at_work> then combine them
[13:49:12] <cwillu_at_work> it's not hard
[13:49:18] <pcfreak30> Helo. I am trying to mess with jquery ui. Why is it when using the css themes that my progress bar is like only a few pixels tall?
[13:49:20] <ticktock71> Not hard, but untidy.
[13:49:40] <cwillu_at_work> I'd much rather get the individual files than have to split them out when doing my own work on one or the other
[13:49:52] <cwillu_at_work> anyways, this bores me :p
[13:50:01] <shama> damnit why doesn't jQuery make me breakfast in the morning?
[13:50:11] <pcfreak30> I am also messing with selectables and it appears that no styles are effecting it as its just a bullet list. Any ideas?
[13:50:12] <NoiseEee> .blt()
[13:50:22] <kanja1> Is there a way to set an event handler for the capture phase, rather than the bubble?
[13:50:27] <ticktock71> A total of 113 kB. Dammit.
[13:50:33] <ticktock71> Big-ass library.
[13:50:44] <pcfreak30> cwillu_at_work: thats why you develop, then make a copy with them combined and use a tool like yui compressor :).
[13:50:51] <mister_m> is there an easy way for me to do a post request to something on a different port
[13:50:56] <cwillu_at_work> pcfreak30, don't tell me that
[13:51:02] <pcfreak30> or write a script to handle it.
[13:51:03] <ajpiano> ticktock71: it's called a build process
[13:51:30] <ajpiano> ticktock71: you can include just jquery and the specific plugins you need and then your build process concats everything together into one file to cut down on http requests in production
[13:51:33] <pcfreak30> mister_m: um just include the post. server:port/file
[13:52:03] <mister_m> pcfreak30: what?
[13:52:10] <interopcop> ngharo: msg me your paypal creds and I'll send you a few bucks.  i've been trying to find this for days.
[13:52:18] <ticktock71> ajpiano: I have already used the minimal required stuff and it's in minimized mode.
[13:52:26] <pcfreak30> do a ajax/post requrast to http://server.com:8080/file
[13:52:27] <interopcop> ngharo: THANKS, DUDE
[13:52:37] <ajpiano> ok
[13:52:42] <pcfreak30> if server.com is were its going to and 8080 is the TCP port
[13:53:07] <mister_m> I'm sending a post to a web application route
[13:53:13] <pcfreak30> ok
[13:53:21] <ngharo> interopcop: meh, donate to jquery or save a puppy or something
[13:53:29] <pcfreak30> its nothing different
[13:53:35] <ngharo> interopcop: thanks though
[13:53:39] <pcfreak30> you have the url to send to
[13:53:46] <pcfreak30> thats where it goes to
[13:54:02] <pcfreak30> now if your using AJAX to a DIFFERENT domain it gets complicated
[13:54:04] <mister_m> pcfreak30: right, but as it is on a different port from where my script is being run - the request is cancelled
[13:54:38] <pcfreak30> are you doing a HTTP form post or ajax post
[13:54:39] <pcfreak30> ?
[13:54:52] <mister_m> pcfreak30: a jquery $.post(...)
[13:55:24] <pcfreak30> mister_m: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795183/jquery-ajax-on-different-port
[13:55:30] <pcfreak30> you will need JSONP
[13:55:36] <mister_m> what is jsonp
[13:55:45] <pcfreak30> basically print out a js code
[13:55:49] <pcfreak30> that gets evauated
[13:55:55] <pcfreak30> its exploiting script tags
[13:56:08] <pcfreak30> look it up as you can get better docs by googling
[13:56:23] <mister_m> that sounds absolutely terrible
[13:56:30] <pcfreak30> well
[13:56:42] <pcfreak30> do to the same origin policyxmlhttp requests have
[13:56:44] <pcfreak30> only way
[13:56:52] <pcfreak30> MANY applications use it
[13:57:05] <pcfreak30> heck i think places like twitter do as well
[13:57:25] <pcfreak30> kinda like how u need a hackish css for ie
[13:57:26] <pcfreak30> :P
[14:01:14] <mehrdad> i have applied the slidedown effect to a div on document.ready and nothing happens
[14:01:35] <mehrdad> with slideUp it works tho as well as when set onclick
[14:03:33] <mehrdad> slidedown doesn't work at all unless done with slideToggle
[14:04:33] <mehrdad> it doesn't have an effect on the div with or without visibility set to hidden
[14:05:38] <mehrdad> does anyone know what could be wrong given my description?
[14:07:36] <NoiseEee> mehrdad: crystal ball... fuzzy
[14:07:45] <NoiseEee> mehrdad: recreate on jsfiddle
[14:07:57] <mehrdad> NoiseEee lol i see
[14:11:04] <mehrdad> NoiseEee before i do that, can u plz tell me what happens to a div in css when slideup is applied to it? visibility:hidden ?
[14:11:30] <mehrdad> because i can observe that only when a slideup is applied then the slidedown works
[14:13:56] <NoiseEee> never used it, see what happens in firebug when you run a demo
[14:16:15] <mehrdad> gonna check it myself in ie9
[14:23:13] <mehrdad> NoiseEee ok found it
[14:23:23] <mehrdad> it sets the display:none
[14:23:49] <mehrdad> i had to set that in css before slidedown and it works now :)
[14:24:07] <NoiseEee> word
[14:24:08] <caniuse> NoiseEee: bond
[14:25:26] <mehrdad> what
[14:37:24] <ticktock71> Weeeeeeell...
[14:37:27] <ticktock71> Got this crap working.
[14:37:42] <ticktock71> But it's disturbing that they encourage invalid markup by doing <script>.
[14:37:48] <ticktock71> Instead of specifying what kind of script.
[14:40:00] <ajpiano> ticktock71: omitting type attr on scripts is perfectly fine and validates in html5
[14:41:08] <ticktock71> Too bad HTML 5 doesn't exist. :/
[14:41:31] <ticktock71> How does it know if you use JavaScript or VBScript (or something else) in that case?
[14:41:48] <ajpiano> meanwhile in the real world, the discussion about actual things that are important continues
[14:42:02] <xec> no type = javascript by default
[14:42:50] <ticktock71> I guess it makes sense for the new version, but current code...
[14:42:56] <xec> and works that way in html parsers since the beginning of this milennium
[14:43:14] <ticktock71> That damn HTML doctype was the most stupid idea ever. It should've just been <html version="X">.
[14:47:44] <fulgetrea> I am trying to perform a javascipt-ajax call and it is throwing this error: "Could not convert JavaScript argument" does anyone know what would cause it
[14:49:32] <supsup> add console.logs to your success property and check out what the data is see if ur xhr request looks like via developer tools or firebug
[14:59:13] <shoky> hmm anyone know a simple way in a browser (i use chrome) to just 'save as' or somehow export the page i'm looking at, with all the elements in their current state?  i'm looking for a simple static html (+css i guess) as output..
[15:00:08] <starsinmypockets> Is it possible to concatenate multiple jquery objects?
[15:00:16] <shoky> yes
[15:00:23] <shoky> well depends what you mean by concatenate
[15:00:54] <shoky> .add() i guess yer lookin for
[15:03:07] <shoky> well i guess what i'm looking for is pretty much what i see in chrome's developertools elements-tab.
[15:03:33] <shoky> not sure if that contains all css tho
[15:03:42] <shoky> and i dont see a simple way to save it or copy it :S
[15:04:10] <starsinmypockets> For instance, I have three objects $first, $second, $last, each of which represents a <tr> element, I;d like to combine them into $combined and do $(this).append($combined);
[15:05:03] <ajpiano> starsinmypockets: var foo = $first.add($second).add($third);
[15:05:23] <Sample> I've perplexed myself... how would I replace a character within a tag. Say, to replace ! with # in: <h1 class"something or other">Some text! here</h1>
[15:05:38] <Sample> i know how to grab the text, and to replace it via .text().replace()
[15:05:48] <starsinmypockets> ajpiano - thanks!
[15:05:58] <Sample> however the issue is modifying the text "inline". "putting" it back into the original tag
[15:06:08] <ajpiano> Sample: the tags cease to be "text" once it's processed into the DOM
[15:06:32] <Sample> im not sure what youre saying but i realize .text() only grabs the text within
[15:06:38] <ajpiano> ohhhh wait i misread your question
[15:06:45] <ajpiano> i thought you wanted to replace the 1 in h1
[15:06:45] <egrouse> Sample: if you set the results of .text(); to a variable
[15:06:55] <Sample> and then do html() on the parent tag
[15:06:57] <Sample> hm
[15:06:58] <ajpiano> Sample: use a function setter
[15:07:04] <Sample> but waht if the parent tag has tags of its own
[15:07:04] <egrouse> you can then do .text( variable ) and put it back in
[15:07:11] <ajpiano> Sample: $(this).text(function(i, text) {  return text.replace("foo", "bar"); });
[15:07:20] <egrouse> or, thats much better
[15:07:29] <Sample> so lets say this. i want to replace ! with # in <h1 class"something or other"><a>Some <span>text! here</span></a></h1>
[15:07:40] <Sample> or some such less hideous amalgamation
[15:07:50] <Sample> .text() obliterates the original structure
[15:07:51] <ajpiano> ahh
[15:08:00] <ajpiano> ?g ba replaceText plugin @ Sample
[15:08:01] <bot-t> Sample, jQuery replaceText: String replace for your jQueries! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-replacetext/docs/
[15:08:06] <Sample> intersting
[15:08:17] <Sample> that may be what i need
[15:08:27] <ajpiano> Sample: or you'd haev to do string replace on the html
[15:08:42] <Sample> yeah
[15:08:57] <Sample> some kind of iteration through all children tags perhaps
[15:09:03] <Sample> doing replaces on the text
[15:09:18] <dilvie> baah. don't do that.
[15:09:25] <Sample> oh?
[15:10:11] <Sample> im thinkin recursive iteration + text().replace() inserting back into the parent tags
[15:10:35] <Sample> id probably have to start from the inside out though
[15:10:38] <ajpiano> just use ben's plugin, it basically does that
[15:10:55] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-replacetext/blob/master/jquery.ba-replacetext.js
[15:11:17] <Sample> yeah. it's not very complicated but might as well do the jquery thing and use a plugin =P
[15:11:18] <dilvie> what's wrong with using innerHTML to get the string version of your dom, and then running a simple string replace on that?
[15:11:32] <dilvie> then you can replace the html node with .html()
[15:11:37] <Sample> well what if I'm replacing > with #
[15:11:43] <Sample> it would match the tags, destroy errything
[15:11:54] <Sample> not a very good solution for someone proclaiming "baah"
[15:12:19] <dilvie> lol
[15:12:27] <dilvie> nevermind... do your thing.
[15:12:39] <nocturnal__> for some reason datepicker does not work properly in a popup
[15:12:44] <Sample> i like my recursive function idea best, i honestly came in here just because im very well versed with javascript but not with jquery and i wanted to make sure it wasnt like "use .replaceText" dummy!
[15:13:21] <Sample> thanks for the brainstorming
[15:13:23] <Sample> and the plugin
[15:13:36] <shesek> Sample, if you're looking to replace '>', it would be &lt; in the html
[15:13:36] <Sample> ajpiano++
[15:13:57] <nocturnal__> it is saying this:  f is undefined anonymous()includ...oken=-1 (line 530) onclick()onclick (line 2) event = click clientX=900, clientY=308
[15:13:58] <Sample> oh yeah? .html() character encodes the html?
[15:14:03] <mister_m> I am doing a $.get(...) against an html file and I want to put the contents of the file into a div on my page
[15:14:30] <shesek> so you could do a simple replace() on the html... but, it'll destroy the DOM elements and re-create them, losing events and other data associated with them
[15:14:41] <Sample> ah
[15:14:48] <mister_m> I am getting a syntax error doing this: $("#pie").empty().append(data); in the get's callback
[15:14:51] <nocturnal__> what might be the cause of this ?
[15:15:14] <shesek> so I wouldn't recommend it... something like ben's approach would work better
[15:15:27] <shesek> do note that his code isn't recursive, tho
[15:15:58] <Nomikos> I have a lil' div that sits next to a link, which when I click it, should trigger a click on that link: alert($(this).siblings('a').attr('href')); $(this).siblings('a').trigger('click');
[15:16:03] <shesek> it'll only find text nodes which're direct childs of your element
[15:16:21] <Nomikos> That first alerts the href, but the second part does nothing, any idea what could cause that?
[15:17:00] <shesek> emulating events isn't exactly the same as the user triggering the event with an actual interaction
[15:17:01] <Sample> right. okay thanks for the additional info shesek
[15:17:23] <shesek> I think click() doesn't work quite well on links
[15:17:26] <Sample> are you of slavic decent by any chance? your nick sounds like it =P
[15:17:54] <shesek> heh, no... its a name of a fruit in hebrew
[15:17:58] <Sample> no actually they dont use sh i think. just an s with a v over it makes "sh" sound
[15:17:59] <Nomikos> shesek: are you replying to me?
[15:18:06] <shesek> Nomikos, yes
[15:18:24] <Nomikos> hm. it works in other places (like jsfiddle, naturally..)
[15:19:01] <Nomikos> might just go with a document.location.yadda instead then
[15:19:21] <shesek> I might be wrong than. IIRC native DOM createEvent doesn't work with links - but perhaps jQuery specifically added handling for that
[15:19:50] <shesek> if it does work on jsfiddle, there's no reason why it wouldn't work on your code
[15:19:54] <Sample> shesek: interesting to note, in slavic languages shasek means fool =P
[15:20:02] <Sample> kid you not
[15:20:23] <Nomikos> shesek: hmkay. I'll file it under assorted oddness for now, maybe look at it again later
[15:20:23] <Sample> kind of a jester. laughable fool
[15:20:27] <Sample> showoff
[15:20:52] <shesek> heh, really? that's no good
[15:20:54] <Sample> czech, slovakian, croatian, slovenian

[15:24:26] <Sample> lol
[15:25:21] <Lurzino> I have some couples of YES/NO buttons like this http://pastebin.com/59H7H86Z, I'd like a good suggest about "toggling" those buttons when clicking... I tried like this code pastebin.com/rpAXCsMu but the only matter is when I click on SAME button which wouldn't work toggling.. any suggest? thanks in advance to all :))
[15:27:15] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Final testing for 1.1 RC2 now, everything is looking great. Anyone have a Boot to Gecko phone that can run thru http://t.co/dzmpNttz ★ http://bit.ly/HqnDsz
[15:28:31] <mister_m> I have one .html file that contains javascript in it that I want to insert into a second html document. Is that possible to do?
[15:33:03] <Lurzino> any suggest for my little issue?
[15:34:58] <chx> hi. i am getting something like {"foo":["bar","baz"]} as a reply from a service and i need the string "barbaz". How would you go around doing this?
[15:35:17] <Sample> chx: join
[15:36:11] <Sample> obj.foo.join('')
[15:36:12] <chx> sorry. The question was not quite full / correct. This is inside other JSON. Yeah, the stack is flawed a bit
[15:36:25] <chx> let me show you what i cooked so far
[15:37:09] <chx> Sample: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/576725/
[15:39:58] <Lurzino> practically if I click on a different "button" than the one I pressed before I can toggle with the code I pasted here pastebin.com/rpAXCsMu , but if I click on the same "button" it can't toggle correctly... what I could have done wrong?
[15:45:46] <Sample> chx: im not sure that helps without having the data structure. is it possible to jsfiddle something?
[15:46:15] <chx> Sample: i can grab a sample
[15:46:24] <chx> Sample: of the string
[15:46:29] <chx> Sample: not sure how to use jsfiddle
[15:46:48] <Sample> oh its awesome
[15:48:58] <Sample> chx: here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/S88js/
[15:49:56] <chx> working on geting you something
[16:05:47] <chx> Sample: http://privatepaste.com/6432e727f4 it's not pretty
[16:08:14] <Sample> taking a look
[16:08:21] <Sample> whoa haha
[16:08:58] <chx> i think i said 'not pretty'
[16:13:52] <katya^> okay, problem: i have an <input type="file"> added to the document via js/jquery, but it won't respond to clicks (i don't mean programmatic clicks)
[16:14:56] <Sample> chx: are you just trying to join all the arrays of all the top-level objects? {"foo":["bar","baz"], "one":["two", "three"]} returns {"foo": "barbaz", "one": "twothree"} ?
[16:15:13] <iLogic> katya^: try live() instead of click()
[16:15:22] <katya^> i'm not using anything
[16:15:35] <iLogic> oh
[16:15:37] <katya^> the only jq/js involvement is adding it to the document
[16:15:47] <iLogic> I see
[16:15:57] <iLogic> no events
[16:17:41] <iLogic> katya^: paste it?
[16:18:51] <katya^> it's just a long boring block of dynamic html creation, with little bits of event handling here and there
[16:19:11] <katya^> maybe sticking it in an iframe would work better
[16:19:19] <iLogic> eew
[16:29:28] <nocturnal__> datepicker is not working in a dialog

[16:30:21] <krz> whats the best way to highlight a text for a split second?
[16:30:38] <krz> i.e. the text turns yellow and then fades away back to its original color
[16:33:56] <krz> wtf, was i kicked out of this channel?
[16:35:29] <chovy> krz: maybe your connection dropped.
[16:36:08] <krz> how do i animate a text. i need it to flash yellow and then fade back to its original color
[16:36:11] <krz> i tried $('#side_panel_artist_profile ul:eq(0) li:eq(0) p span:eq(0)').animate({ color: 'yellow' }, 'slow');
[16:36:24] <krz> doesn't seem to work
[16:48:47] <gnarf> ?highlight @krz
[16:48:49] <bot-t> krz, UI/Effects/Highlight - Highlights the element's background with a specific color, default is yellow. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Highlight
[16:49:12] <gnarf> also krz - jQuery can't animate colors natively - you need to use the color plugin
[16:49:14] <gnarf> ?color
[16:49:15] <bot-t> Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[16:51:15] <katya^> and it worked perfectly*
[16:58:17] <MysterOnyx> I'm trying to get jquery UI's autocomplete to work using a mysql database. For some reason, when you type in a word that it finds within the database, it doesn't show the autocomplete drop down correctly. You can see a small-drop down with no text, though. http://pastebin.com/PiACwRaD
[17:09:24] <imsky> thurrrsday
[17:11:33] <MysterOnyx> nevermind, I figured it out. I needed to have one of the fields be named "value"
[17:30:25] <aJacom> Hi. I'm trying to create a horizontal scroll effect for a client of mine. Upon clicking on the menu, the page would slide sideways. Could anyone offer any tips on how to structure the assignment?
[17:31:33] <xec> would you need to be able to scroll sideways as well?
[17:31:45] <xec> or just on menu click
[17:32:19] <aJacom> xec: Just menu click. I suppose clicking would show a typical AJAX loader, and preload the page and then slide it.
[17:32:34] <aJacom> xec: But I'm not sure how is that specifically done, or if it can be done.
[17:33:30] <xec> well, there's two or three ways i've seen it done, none are very user friendly though
[17:34:45] <xec> you can either only show one normal page and just use animation/transitions to make it look like it's sliding
[17:34:47] <aJacom> xec: This would be called "sliding" rather than "Scrolling", really. I need the whole website loaded (to redo the entire website again into one page with multiple <li>'s in order to have it slidable(""), its too much right now.
[17:35:02] <xec> or have the entire page loaded and just scroll between them
[17:35:35] <aJacom> xec Both your approaches require merging all the content into one big file, no ?
[17:36:15] <xec> no, the first version could load content on menu click, then slide
[17:36:38] <xec> you would basically only ever have 1 page, just make it look like it's sliding
[17:37:49] <aJacom> xec I'm sorry, I'm not following: Do you mean loading the entire content initially and group them into adjacent <div>'s or other elements, and then sliding between them on click? Or do you mean preloading the next page on click using $.ajax ?
[17:37:58] <aJacom> (If any :P)
[17:38:03] <xec> step 1, listen to menu click, send ajax call for whatever is clicked
[17:38:49] <xec> in the callback you create a box that slides in while you slide out the existing content
[17:40:30] <aJacom> xec: And does this box hold the content of the new page ? Or is it just a blank box that gives the illusion of being the new page being slided?
[17:41:03] <xec> you dump the new content in the new box, yes, whatever the server returned
[17:41:20] <xec> if that's what you're asking
[17:42:26] <aJacom> xec The problem with that approach is that the server is going to respond with a full HTML page (with <head> tags and all), and I am supposed to insert it into an element that's hidden with CSS. So what do I do with the meta elements ?
[17:43:35] <xec> ideally you make the server respond with what you want ;)
[17:43:52] <xec> but you could filter out from the html what you need too
[17:44:30] <aJacom> Seems a little bit hacky. But I suppose that's my only solution while using WordPress.
[17:44:38] <aJacom> I'm not making a new theme.
[17:45:03] <xec> which part
[17:45:08] <xec> feels hacky, i mean
[17:46:15] <aJacom> Having to throw in the garbage a bunch of "extra output", and even more: possibly having to change the <title>, and <head> elements using jQuery.
[17:47:25] <jaha> any reason this wouldnt work? console.log($('[disabled]',this).length);
[17:48:03] <xec> jaha: depends, what is it supposed to do?
[17:48:18] <jaha> sry, its within a live(click)
[17:48:44] <jaha> supposed to see if the clicked anchor is disabled
[17:49:05] <jaha> its returning 0 in both cases
[17:49:43] <xec> jaha: i thought only form elements coud be disabled? but maybe try something like $(this).is(":disabled")
[17:49:51] <xec> could*
[17:51:01] <jaha> hm still false
[17:51:17] <xec> what does the html look like?
[17:51:20] <xec> ?p
[17:51:20] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:53:21] <xec> aJacom: yeah, if you want your site indexed and accessible you most likely don't want to create content on the fly like that
[17:53:37] <xec> aJacom: i usually work with web apps where this is not an issue
[17:54:16] <aJacom> xec I'm always eager to learn. What are those ?
[17:54:37] <jaha> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/D5h4C/
[17:54:57] <xec> what do you mean, what indexed and accessible is?
[17:55:34] <aJacom> xec Regarding your comment about indexation. All of the pages will still be accessible individually, so I suppose they will still have indexation.
[17:55:59] <aJacom> xec No, I meant what frameworks do you use that would allow things like these to work without such pains :)
[17:58:11] <xec> aJacom: no such thing i'm afraid, different frameworks have different strengths and weaknesses - and i assume you're talking about server-side frameworks, where pretty much none will help with horizontally scrolling sites ;)
[17:58:49] <aJacom> xec Oh, so what did you meant with "web apps" ?
[17:59:33] <aJacom> *mean... Damn you bad habits.
[17:59:46] <jaha> xec: so far this is the only selector which returns different results but im worried about it not being consistent in browsers
[17:59:47] <jaha> $(this).attr('disabled')
[17:59:54] <xec> aJacom: sites like gmail and facebook don't worry about seo
[18:00:26] <jaha> course, as long as it remains falsy
[18:01:00] <aJacom> xec No, I suppose they don't.
[18:02:25] <xec> because you don't want to be able to search on google for your emails or wall posts etc
[18:02:43] <aJacom> xec I was thinking more on the lines of "What do they care"
[18:03:35] <aJacom> xec But yes, of course.
[18:03:39] <xec> so, is your site a web app, or more of a promotion, or articles/news?
[18:04:38] <aJacom>  xec I see your point.
[18:05:19] <xec> jaha: i don't think "disabled" is a valid attribute of <a> ?
[18:05:34] <aJacom> xec As a professional, though, I'm going to advise my client about his choice, and leave the option for him to decide. Who knows if he prefers sliding content instead of visitors.
[18:07:14] <jaha> xec: yea i think that's it, but you would think it would still be able to select it
[18:07:58] <xec> jaha: you could also do $(this).is('[disabled]')
[18:08:11] <xec> if you just want to check for the attribute
[18:08:41] <jaha> i think i tried that and it didnt work
[18:09:02] <xec> jaha: looks ok to me http://jsfiddle.net/D5h4C/1/
[18:09:50] <jaha> hmm, could of sworn i tried that one too, must of had a syntax error
[18:10:06] <jaha> thanks, ill use that since its more consistent that then .attr()
[18:12:04] <Parhs> hello i am having a strange problem
[18:12:25] <xec> i *love* strange problems
[18:12:53] <Parhs> my slideshow that is based on interval when i switch tab fails for a reason after a while:S
[18:13:35] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/hello/fdg#
[18:13:46] <Parhs> seems like it stops
[18:14:42] <xec> tabs as in browser window, or is the menu on your site "tabs"?
[18:14:45] <Parhs> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6183463/when-using-setinterval-if-i-switch-tabs-in-chrome-and-go-back-the-slider-goes
[18:14:50] <Parhs> seems like this is similar
[18:16:38] <xec> is there a way to reliably make it fail?
[18:16:56] <Parhs> just switch tab at chrome for a while
[18:17:11] <Parhs> 1 minute i think is enough
[18:17:14] <xec> ah, im on firefox, looks fine
[18:17:22] <Parhs> stupid chrome
[18:17:39] <xec> but yeah, on chrome it stopped
[18:17:54] <Parhs> heh
[18:18:02] <Parhs> there should be a workaround
[18:18:39] <Parhs> in opera seems ok.
[18:18:41] <Parhs> too
[18:19:01] <tw2113> hahaha chrome
[18:23:21] <xec> Parhs: made a fiddle to play with at http://jsfiddle.net/xhJBE/
[18:23:31] <xec> it stops at the end...
[18:24:57] <Parhs> wow :P
[18:25:09] <Parhs> what do  you mean ?
[18:25:45] <xec> it doesnt seem to loop, maybe something i forgot to copy?
[18:25:46] <Parhs> i thought that it was simple but chrome makes my life difficult
[18:25:53] <Parhs> it loops to me
[18:26:24] <Parhs> tried refreshing?
[18:26:31] <Parhs> propably you should visit the link again
[18:27:08] <Parhs> its stupid design but the designer wants this stupid staff
[18:28:58] <xec> the logic looks a bit strange to me though
[18:29:36] <xec> you're looking for an "end" class
[18:30:04] <xec> which is on some arbitrary image in the middle somewhere?
[18:30:30] <shoky> there's a start and end
[18:31:48] <xec> but the start isn't at the start, and the end isn't at the end :D
[18:32:18] <shoky> if they were he wouldn't need the classes...
[18:32:22] <xec> but, in my chrome it hasn't stopped after i switched to setTimeout http://jsfiddle.net/xhJBE/1/
[18:32:35] <shoky> setInterval is still working fine
[18:32:39] <shoky> when the animations stop
[18:32:55] <shoky> so that's weird
[18:33:01] <xec> they shouldn't stop, if i understood Parhs correct
[18:33:31] <shoky> what
[18:33:44] <xec> it should keep sliding forever
[18:34:05] <shoky> yeah..
[18:34:35] <xec> and the one with setInterval stops after a while if you change tabs for a bit
[18:35:15] <shoky> yeah, that's what i said is weird
[18:35:19] <imsky> doop do doop
[18:35:48] <xec> oh, i thought you said it was working fine
[18:36:10] <shoky> i meant that setInterval is working fine, not that the animation works fine when using setInterval ;p
[18:36:30] <shoky> i.e. that anonymous function is still being called every 2 seconds
[18:36:35] <shoky> but the animation stops
[18:36:39] <xec> i see
[18:36:45] <shoky> er its not anonymous
[18:36:47] <shoky> sry
[18:38:05] <shoky> well it's not that weird i guess
[18:38:59] <xec> i think chrome does something weird with setInterval, to save cpu cycles or something, and when you switch tabs back it fires a lot of them, and because of the animation time, you check for the end class after it's been skipped
[18:39:23] <xec> i'm tired so that doesn't read too well
[18:39:32] <xec> i'm going to bed :P
[18:39:39] <shoky> night
[18:39:43] <xec> it's 3:40 am here
[18:39:59] <shoky> 4:40 here
[18:40:01] <xec> the setTimeout version failed after a while too
[18:40:13] <xec> haha, good night to you too then shoky :D
[18:40:29] <shoky> ;D
[18:40:56] <imsky> it's 9:40PM here you immigrants
[18:41:41] <xec> imsky: your logic is flawed, if i was an immigrant i would have the same time as you ;)
[18:41:50] <imsky> i know, i'm an immigrant
[18:41:54] <xec> heheh
[18:42:06] <Parhs> xec its 4:41 am here:P
[18:42:11] <imsky> get outta my country
[18:42:13] <imsky> slash timezone
[18:42:21] <Parhs> i think i fixed it. added setTimeout 2 times
[18:42:22] <shoky> omg Parhs and i must be so close
[18:42:30] <shoky> 2 times?
[18:42:33] <xec> Parhs: lol
[18:42:33] <Parhs> where are you?
[18:42:34] <shoky> oh yeh.
[18:42:41] <shoky> me israel
[18:42:48] <xec> Parhs: if that fails, try three or four setTimouts
[18:42:49] <shoky> you greece
[18:42:51] <shoky> very close indeed
[18:43:07] <xec> good night and good luck ;)

[19:13:22] <ArexBawrin> I'm trying to toggle the visibility of some paragraph text, but it seems to only work once:( http://jsfiddle.net/unAUC/2/
[19:13:42] <imsky> who uses visibility?
[19:13:46] <imsky> honestly
[19:13:59] <ArexBawrin> beginners<--
[19:13:59] <abjorn> lol yeah i got side tracked
[19:14:04] <abjorn> and unfortunately yes, yes it is
[19:14:15] <abjorn> actually, not  unfortunately, i rather like that kind of music thank you very much
[19:14:18] <ArexBawrin> im doing the newboston stuff
[19:15:02] <imsky> abjorn: lol i know you tortured soul
[19:15:18] <abjorn> i know
[19:15:19] <abjorn> i just
[19:15:25] <abjorn> no one understands me, you know?
[19:15:28] <abjorn> no one knows my pain
[19:15:42] <imsky> lol
[19:15:46] <imsky> legit mates bud
[19:16:09] <abjorn> well now im on Rob Zombie so I don't know if that counts as angsty
[19:16:12] <abjorn> I don't think it does
[19:16:20] <imsky> ArexBawrin: http://jsfiddle.net/unAUC/3/
[19:16:22] <abjorn> his songs are about cars, sex, and horror
[19:16:27] <imsky> abjorn: it doesn't. i like dragula
[19:16:28] <abjorn> 100% of them
[19:16:33] <abjorn> dragula is pretty bitchin
[19:16:44] <abjorn> That guy has a 3 track mind.
[19:16:51] <imsky> that's all you need
[19:16:59] <abjorn> tru nuff
[19:17:05] <imsky> you working on proto?
[19:17:08] <abjorn> not atm
[19:17:25] <ArexBawrin> imsky: what is the visible !importance for?
[19:17:37] <imsky> ArexBawrin: because you provide visibility:hidden inline
[19:17:38] <abjorn> so you can be extra extra sure!
[19:17:43] <imsky> hard to override that damn specificity
[19:17:45] <ArexBawrin> lol
[19:17:49] <abjorn> yeeeaah
[19:18:16] <ArexBawrin> imsky: Thank you:)
[19:18:20] <imsky> yw ArexBawrin
[19:18:54] <imsky> damn this is my 6th year with jquery
[19:19:08] <imsky> that's undergrad and grad school put together
[19:19:37] <Hawkee> not when you're me
[19:19:46] <Hawkee> my undergrad took 6 years
[19:20:05] <imsky> ok so just undergrad for you
[19:20:23] <Hawkee> you finish grad school?
[19:20:39] <imsky> haven't started it
[19:20:54] <imsky> i'm actually in middle school
[19:21:00] <imsky> working hard on that middle school diploma
[19:21:23] <Hawkee> ah yes, that crucial degree
[19:21:30] <Hawkee> so you started jQuery really early
[19:21:48] <imsky> yeah lol i was digging around my early projects, was surprised to find jquery stuff in 06
[19:21:49] <Hawkee> most people are doing mIRC at that age
[19:22:08] <Hawkee> wish more were like you
[19:22:15] <imsky> wat
[19:22:21] <chee> what is this
[19:22:36] <imsky> i dunno, i was reminiscing and this guy just goes nuts over mirc
[19:22:46] <chee> please calm down sir
[19:22:56] <imsky> lol
[19:22:59] <imsky> irc flight attendant chee
[19:23:25] <Hawkee> me? nuts?
[19:23:52] <katya^> how can i prevent a parent element's click event from firing before a child event which is higher up in in z-order?
[19:24:06] <imsky> ?event.target @ katya^
[19:24:07] <bot-t> katya^, event.target: The DOM element that initiated the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[19:24:10] <Hawkee> if you say so
[19:24:36] <Hawkee> katya^, I was just trying to figure that one out myself the other day
[19:25:23] <Hawkee> I think what I did was disable the parent element when the first click registered
[19:25:33] <Hawkee> but I didn't end up using it
[19:25:38] <Hawkee> it got too ugly
[19:26:41] <Hawkee> bot-t's solution looks good
[19:38:11] <abjorn> om nom nom chicken wings om nom nom
[19:38:19] <imsky> lol

[19:51:54] <gnarf> *cough* ot
[19:51:56] <imsky> oh, things i didn't care about as a kid: pokemon, dbz, niravana
[19:51:59] <imsky> nirvana even
[19:52:07] <imsky> and by nirvana i mean all rock
[19:55:12] <abjorn> the first two were half my childhood
[19:55:23] <abjorn> the other half was doing generally retarded things
[19:55:54] <hobs> all those references
[19:56:12] <hobs> pokemon was a thing that everyone should enjoy once
[19:56:17] <abjorn> ^
[19:56:31] <hobs> how else can you make harden jokes
[19:56:43] <abjorn> PENIS used HARDEN!
[19:56:54] <abjorn> protip: always nickname your caterpie "PENIS"
[19:57:11] <hobs> always nickname all your pokemone to PENIS!!!!!
[19:57:19] <hobs> 10x better game
[19:57:37] <abjorn> Nah, you gotta have different names at the least
[20:12:07] <imsky> anything that requires suspension of disbelief
[20:12:11] <imsky> is too much work
[20:18:39] <fang0654> I have the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/ydAbv/ that won't seem to work in ie8
[20:18:57] <imsky>   document.getElementById("report_results").innerHTML = result;
[20:18:58] <fang0654> it just returned 'undefined' in the div it is supposed to update.  Anyone have any idea why?
[20:19:00] <imsky> my eyes
[20:19:48] <fang0654> not the prettiest?
[20:20:02] <imsky> you know you're using jquery everywhere else right?
[20:20:09] <imsky> $("#report_results").html(result)
[20:20:30] <fang0654> Yeah.  I originally had $, but I tried explicitly putting jquery to try and fix ie8
[20:20:37] <fang0654> oh, didn't know that.  I'll update it and try it out
[20:20:45] <imsky> this will work in everything
[20:23:26] <fang0654> still no love
[20:23:34] <imsky> you're failing at life
[20:23:40] <fang0654> pretty much
[20:23:43] <imsky> i see a .NET career in your future
[20:23:49] <fang0654> eww please
[20:24:06] <imsky> only one thing left to do
[20:24:10] <imsky> console.log all the things
[20:28:06] <fang0654> stupid question.  What do I put where?
[20:28:15] <imsky> abjorn: holy shit man, someone put me into softpedia
[20:28:18] <imsky> abjorn: http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Development-Scripts-js/Other-Libraries/cssFx-Ivan-Malopinsky-73828.html
[20:28:31] <imsky> "It simply allows him to write pure CSS code and have it render as he intended to."
[20:28:35] <imsky> ahh foreign speakers
[20:28:46] <imsky> fang0654: console.log every variable everywhere
[20:31:44] <abjorn> lol
[20:31:46] <abjorn> nice
[20:32:15] <imsky> 1.0 is comin' up!
[20:36:39] <fang0654> hmm..  the "result" variable keeps coming up undefined
[20:37:28] <imsky> now try it in firefox
[20:39:38] <fang0654> firefox returned with the results= the resulting page
[20:39:58] <fang0654> the POST and the response
[20:40:11] <imsky> ruh roh
[20:40:39] <fang0654> which is how to should be
[20:42:51] <imsky> well ma frend
[20:43:00] <fang0654> send hatemail to redmond?
[20:43:04] <imsky> no no
[20:43:07] <imsky> it's your fault
[20:43:14] <fang0654> yeah
[20:43:16] <fang0654> that's a given
[20:43:21] <imsky> because let's be rational here
[20:43:30] <imsky> if $.ajax failed in ie8, jquery wouldn't really be popular
[20:43:57] <fang0654> true.  Does ie8 expect a specific header for it to consider the returned results valid?
[20:44:23] <imsky> not sure, and probably not
[20:44:27] <imsky> although that's a good question
[20:44:32] <imsky> you might be returning some weird mime-type
[20:44:42] <imsky> and if it's xml, good luck
[20:44:51] <fang0654> just boilerplate html
[20:45:20] <imsky> yeeeeeeeeeaaahhhhh
[20:48:16] <iateadonut> i have an <input> in the <tr> above the <input type=submit> button i have in the <tr> below.
[20:48:38] <iateadonut> so, like <tr><td></td><td><input></td></tr>
[20:48:48] <iateadonut> <tr><td></td><td><input type=submit></td></tr>
[20:49:12] <iateadonut> how do i use jquery when a function uses this to find the first input based on the second input?
[20:49:20] <iateadonut> $(node).prevAll... something
[20:49:23] <iateadonut> something like that.
[20:49:36] <iateadonut> and actually i'm looking for 4 inputs in the same column to clear them all.
[20:50:01] <iateadonut> i guess i have to just do parent() and all that a bunch of times, or is there an easier way to traverse the DOM?
[20:50:22] <oojacoboo> https://gist.github.com/2316674  -- can someone tell me how to best write those selectors?
[20:50:35] <oojacoboo> I'm not having much success with them it seems
[20:51:16] <iateadonut> what's the one that goes UP the DOM, not prevAll, but something else?
[20:51:21] <iateadonut> maybe it is prevAll
[20:51:39] <oojacoboo> closest?

[21:08:56] <fang0654> Well, I'm out of ideas for the night.  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction
[21:14:57] <Silne30> Do any of you use jQuery in conjunction with ASP.NET?
[21:19:21] <katya^> question: is it possible to create a jquery ui dialog without a titlebar, without sneakily hiding the titlebar div?
[21:35:30] <rufsketch1> hello everyone
[21:36:13] <rufsketch1> I'm trying to make it so an element does not accept drops onto it
[21:36:22] <rufsketch1> but I get this error
[21:37:12] <rufsketch1> TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'droppable'
[21:37:25] <rufsketch1> What am I missing?
[21:38:01] <rufsketch1> that's on doing .droppable({disabled: true})
[21:38:05] <rufsketch1> !ping
[21:38:54] <rufsketch1> sorry, new chat client. Just making sure.
[21:43:33] <RPkS> Installed a carousel on my site, it's working great. Except when a product doesn't have any additional images, then it disappears and the next div in line jumps under the div that holds the carousel. It creates a mess. Can someone help me figure out the cure?
[22:37:31] <Lurzino> hello everyone
[22:37:48] <Kyoorius> hey guys.... wondering if i could get some feedback on this jquery plugin
[22:38:07] <Kyoorius> anyone here to look?
[22:39:39] <haizum> i have a callback function thats really slowing down my masonry animation triggered when a new page is loaded, how can i specify to only run it once the previous functions are complete?
[22:40:06] <haizum> setting a timer doesn't seem like the best answer
[22:40:22] <Lurzino> I have some couples of YES/NO buttons like this http://pastebin.com/59H7H86Z, I'd like a good suggest about "toggling" those buttons when pressing... I tried like this code pastebin.com/rpAXCsMu but with this code if I press on a different "button" then it changes state and remains changed, but if I press same "button" looks like it toggles the state from pressed to unpressed but then it goes back to pressed .. any suggest? thanks in advance to all :))

[22:44:12] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: what's your question?
[22:44:17] <jqueryhelp> hi
[22:44:27] <jqueryhelp> im trying to post data on a website
[22:44:32] <jqueryhelp> im astebin it
[22:44:40] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : wondering if i could steal seomeones thoughts on a plugin i wrote today
[22:44:59] <johnkpaul> so what is the plugin
[22:45:02] <johnkpaul> don't ask to ask, just ask
[22:45:05] <jqueryhelp> http://pastebin.com/3TSVm6ZF
[22:45:16] <Kyoorius> its a friend picker for facebook
[22:45:35] <Kyoorius> https://github.com/nightagency/facebook-friend-picker/blob/master/js/facebookFriendPicker.js
[22:46:20] <jqueryhelp> you see, im trying to send a phonenumber to a form and make it submit...
[22:46:51] <johnkpaul> hm, jquery ui widgets are something that I know very little about
[22:47:03] <jqueryhelp> http://videotron.trouvetout.ca/en/b/pizzeria-villeray#
[22:47:12] <Kyoorius> hmmmm..... anyone else in here a jqui beast?
[22:47:17] <johnkpaul> my first thought Kyoorius is that I have no idea where your entry point is
[22:47:24] <jqueryhelp> this is the website im trying to complete the form that i shown when we hit call for free
[22:47:34] <johnkpaul> also, you might want to take a look at addy osmani's jquery plugin pattern blog post
[22:48:05] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : widget factory fires _create and _init on widget creation..... the user fires the open function on click
[22:48:08] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: so what is the problem?
[22:48:18] <jqueryhelp> i can't seem to complete it
[22:48:31] <jqueryhelp> it's like if it never reaches the form
[22:48:43] <jqueryhelp> give it a try my phone number is 5142717062
[22:48:54] <jqueryhelp> hit the call for free link on the website
[22:49:04] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: ive read those and usually use them for regular jquery plugins... however jqui has its own pattern it works off
[22:49:17] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: there are jquery ui widget patterns in there too
[22:49:34] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: really? ok ill definitely revisit
[22:50:00] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[22:50:00] <jqueryhelp> i jst received the call
[22:50:16] <jqueryhelp> so you see there like adort of delai
[22:50:18] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: ok, so it's working?
[22:50:31] <johnkpaul> so you're issue is the delay?
[22:50:33] <jqueryhelp> is there a way for me to like load all the webpage but hide the html
[22:50:38] <jqueryhelp> execpt for the window
[22:50:50] <johnkpaul> I really don't know what you mean
[22:51:02] <Lurzino> no suggest for my little issue? :)
[22:51:12] <jqueryhelp> i mean like when i start the script
[22:51:16] <jqueryhelp> http://pastebin.com/3TSVm6ZF
[22:51:22] <jqueryhelp> the call is never received
[22:52:49] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: I don't see that in your page
[22:53:04] <jqueryhelp> what you mean
[22:53:13] <johnkpaul> Lurzino: what was your problem?
[22:53:24] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: I don't see the code that you sent me in paste bin, in your live page
[22:53:47] <johnkpaul> also, you're specifiying $.post, bt you're passing get parameters in the url
[22:55:22] <Lurzino> johnkpaul , I have some couples of YES/NO buttons like this http://pastebin.com/59H7H86Z, I tried like this code pastebin.com/rpAXCsMu but with this code if I press on a different "button" then it changes state and remains changed from pressed to unpressed, but if I press same "button" looks like it toggles the state from pressed to unpressed but then it goes back to pressed... is there sort of a way to recognize that same button was previously pressed so I do
[22:55:39] <johnkpaul> Lurzino: can you please create a jsfiddle live example
[22:55:45] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @Lurzino
[22:55:46] <bot-t> Lurzino, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[22:56:34] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : anything obviously bad you see
[22:57:03] <jqueryhelp> this is the website im trying the code on, http://test.zatlags.com/public_html/google/, the website im trying to post the data to is http://videotron.trouvetout.ca/fr/b/pizzeria-villeray
[22:57:16] <Lurzino> ok johnkpaul I'll do a little live example... hold on
[22:57:54] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: no, nothing obivously _bad_
[22:57:58] <johnkpaul> I could come up with some comments though
[22:58:14] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : im all ears... need to get better at this
[22:58:38] <johnkpaul> I dont' know what browsers you're targeting, but if you're planning on making this part of a library, you need to wrap console, or make sure that it's available before you use it
[22:58:43] <johnkpaul> if you want to keep those console calls throughout the code
[22:59:24] <johnkpaul> I think some of your ternarys are confusing, and if I was code reviewing I'd ask you to reconsider them
[22:59:27] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : gotcha just haven't removed them yet
[22:59:40] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : sounds interesting.. what line number?
[22:59:47] <johnkpaul> 355
[22:59:50] <johnkpaul> 255*
[22:59:56] <jqueryhelp> then, if maybe what im trying to do is kinda really hard, is there a way i could open that webpage on a iframe and then control it ?
[23:00:13] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: to be honest, I'm still extrmely confused about what you're trying to do
[23:01:14] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : agreed. that line gave me trouble... therefore i may have forced it a bit... anything that requires so much fighting is usually wrong
[23:01:38] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: allows you to "select" friends from a list of your facebook friends with group and search functionality
[23:01:50] <johnkpaul> yeah, the same is true for any one line of code that requires > 1 minute of thought
[23:02:12] <jqueryhelp> you remember the option call for free, it makes a pop up, and it demands you to enter a phone number, im trying to put the phone number into the box and excute that script
[23:02:32] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: im starting to learn that
[23:02:33] <jqueryhelp> with out you or i entering it
[23:03:12] <johnkpaul> ooh, jqueryhelp I see
[23:03:19] <jqueryhelp> :)
[23:03:20] <johnkpaul> and where in that page is that code
[23:03:30] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: from NYC?
[23:03:39] <johnkpaul> ever hit the meetup scene?
[23:03:41] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : yep
[23:04:01] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul : not as yet... went to one meetup but was sorely disappointed with the turnout
[23:04:01] <jqueryhelp> firebug the call for free, it'S just under it (the form) would you like me to paste bin it ?
[23:04:21] <Kyoorius> johnkapaul: u?
[23:04:36] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: which meetup? some of them are much more popular than others, but I have dreams of having a vibrant meetup community
[23:04:55] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: hackerfest orgnaised by kaltura
[23:05:01] <jqueryhelp> http://pastebin.com/wEUquxUy
[23:05:16] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: the one at that bar in the village?
[23:05:19] <johnkpaul> I didn't go to those
[23:05:29] <johnkpaul> I wouldn't really consider a hackathon at a bar to be a meetup
[23:05:36] <johnkpaul> but I suppose that's arbitrary :)
[23:05:50] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: at a sports bar
[23:06:10] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: thankfully i went with a friend and drowned myself in beer
[23:06:11] <johnkpaul> yeah, I was actually wondering if you had wifi and power there
[23:06:29] <johnkpaul> haha, what's funny is that today was a great day of js controversy
[23:06:33] <johnkpaul> around drowning yourself in beer
[23:06:48] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: really? how so
[23:07:34] <jqueryhelp> so john
[23:08:32] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: http://ryanfunduk.com/culture-of-exclusion/
[23:09:07] <johnkpaul> so jqueryhelp, there's no javascript in that pastebin
[23:09:18] <johnkpaul> you just added a form undernearth?
[23:09:51] <jqueryhelp> i did not make the code
[23:09:59] <jqueryhelp> im trying to link both pages
[23:10:18] <jqueryhelp> http://videotron.trouvetout.ca/en/b/pizzeria-villeray# here is the website
[23:10:19] <johnkpaul> hm, before you said that you were trying to prepopulate that dialog window and click a button
[23:10:24] <johnkpaul> now you're saying that you want to link both pages
[23:10:28] <johnkpaul> :) I'm confused again
[23:10:32] <jqueryhelp> lol
[23:10:43] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: so don't let that meetup be your only experience
[23:10:56] <johnkpaul> I'm actually trying to get the jQuery NYC meetup going again
[23:11:33] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: im tempted to TL; DR based solely on his opposition to beer... sounds great... id like to come to the next one
[23:12:07] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: http://www.meetup.com/jQueryNYC/
[23:12:13] <johnkpaul> you should join, and suggest a meetup if you have any ideas
[23:12:25] <johnkpaul> or speak, if you want to explain how to extend jquery ui widges
[23:12:27] <johnkpaul> widgets :)
[23:12:38] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: you see my confusion, right?
[23:13:40] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: ha i think itll be a while yet before i can be confident enough in my knowledge to speak... attending on the other hands sounds completely feasible and highly likely
[23:13:54] <jqueryhelp> then lets try another way, XD is there a way i could open the http://videotron.trouvetout.ca/en/b/pizzeria-villeray inside my website (like lets say an iframe) then hide the iframe (1px height 1 px width), is there a way i could make that pop up box apear in the iframe like if someone clicked it and then like change the value of the empty field and then like hit the button
[23:14:20] <jqueryhelp>  but all with jquery
[23:14:23] <jqueryhelp> or ajax...
[23:14:25] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean click the button from code running outside of the domain of that page?
[23:14:41] <jqueryhelp> euhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[23:14:43] <johnkpaul> so you want to programatically "click" inside the iframe from a different domain
[23:14:49] <jqueryhelp> yes
[23:14:50] <Kyoorius> johnkpaul: perhaps i might convince my work to host a meetup and give a little back to the community....
[23:14:57] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's not possible because of browser security restrictions
[23:15:08] <jqueryhelp> ok
[23:15:21] <johnkpaul> think about the havoc I could cause if I could script your browser to automatically tweet or send email without you knowing
[23:15:32] <johnkpaul> Kyoorius: oh, that would be great, I am looking for space lined up
[23:15:35] <jqueryhelp> but can you think of anyway i could make the form submit my phone number and create the call
[23:16:03] <johnkpaul> jqueryhelp: that's possible, you'll need to do a lot of work with charles http proxy or something like that
[23:16:12] <johnkpaul> not at all jquery related, but you can fake all of the http requests
[23:16:32] <johnkpaul> you'll need to change your nick to screenscraping-and-automation-help
[23:17:18] <jqueryhelp> ....
[23:18:14] <jqueryhelp> is there a way i could only download the field with the call for free link using jquery ?
[23:18:19] <jqueryhelp> and put it in a div?
[23:19:15] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know what you mean by downloading the field
[23:19:23] <johnkpaul> I think you're trying to screenscrape though
[23:19:29] <jqueryhelp> i mean getting only a section
[23:19:32] <johnkpaul> which is in the realm of possibility, but not easy
[23:19:37] <johnkpaul> or not straightforward
[23:19:49] <johnkpaul> I need to head to sleep jqueryhelp, good luck and perhaps you'll find more help tomorrow
[23:20:03] <jqueryhelp> yas thanks
[23:20:05] <jqueryhelp> night
[23:20:10] <jqueryhelp> after all its only 2 am
[23:20:13] <jqueryhelp> right
[23:20:14] <jqueryhelp> XD
[23:20:24] <jqueryhelp> happy easter
[23:49:39] <anton000> hello
[23:54:17] <d2_> hi
[23:54:22] <chrs_> hi
[23:55:10] <d2_> wrapAll() do an eval off included scripts any idea to avoid this ?
[23:55:17] <d2_> -off +of
[23:55:26] <haizum> im using stButtons.locateElements(); to add sharing buttons to my page via the sharethis script, but it's really bogging down my page loading animation, as its being run in a callback as a function at the same time the animation is happening. how can i specify for it to run only after the animation is completed? (using masonry)
[23:56:41] * d2_ stupid do a $('script').remove() before
[23:56:55] <d2_> thank you d2 !
[23:56:57] <d2_> bye
[23:57:20] <haizum> lol
