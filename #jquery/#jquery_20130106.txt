[00:03:28] <Tomashe> hey guys
[00:03:32] <Tomashe> why this isnt working
[00:03:33] <Tomashe> http://pastebin.com/Z0PJgdBL
[00:03:53] <Tomashe> it is working but its the complete is happening twise on every interval loop
[00:06:52] <angryasian> and.. I'm back.
[00:08:37] <angryasian> Did you tell me your problem DrDank? If so I didn't get it
[00:10:26] <C0dpe> Hello.. how can I test if $(this).children returned an element? (I need to check if there's or not a child of a certain element)
[00:11:46] <HeN> C0dpe: $(this).children().length > 0
[00:12:11] <angryasian> Children is a method not a property. What HeN said.
[00:12:16] <C0dpe> I saw that in some websites HeN, but there's no such property
[00:12:28] <Whiskey> $(document).ready(spaceIt); just run one right
[00:13:00] <C0dpe> that method returns a boolean?
[00:13:13] <angryasian> it returns an array of children.
[00:13:24] <angryasian> arrays have a property called length. you can check if length > 0
[00:13:49] <C0dpe> ah, got it.. thank you
[00:14:41] <C0dpe> This is AWSOME!
[00:18:20] <Whiskey> I wanne know if its some one like $(document).ready(spaceIt); that make the javascript reads all the time and see if the rules are set, or does jquery don´t have a function like that,
[00:18:31] <Whiskey> like CSS always' see if it meets the requirements
[00:21:17] <angryasian> Whiskey your english doesn't make any sense. That code says run a function called spaceIt() when the document is ready.
[00:22:23] <Whiskey> yej
[00:22:30] <Whiskey> yeh but i want that function to run all the time
[00:22:36] <Whiskey> not just when its loaded
[00:22:47] <Whiskey> as $(document).ready(spaceIt); only loads it once
[00:23:59] <Whiskey> angryasian you don´t get it?
[00:24:07] <tw2113> so you want it being called constantly?
[00:24:13] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:24:15] <Whiskey> exactly
[00:24:51] <tw2113> what is in spaceIt that needs run constantly, if i may ask
[00:27:08] <C0dpe> thank you guys.. night all

[00:55:22] <Whirl3d> Hello #jquery, just a quick question:  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ma7St/7/   Why does the "mouseover" event happen on the parent element every time a sub-element is rolled over even though I use preventDefault()
[00:56:30] <tw2113> Whirl3d, try stopPropagation()
[00:57:35] <Whirl3d> tw2113, perfect. Obviously. Thanks tons.
[00:57:43] <tw2113> i was right? wow
[00:58:45] <Whirl3d> You are always a consummate wealth of information.
[01:02:01] <phonebook_> sup bitches is anyone here?
[01:02:42] <phonebook_> figures
[01:02:54] <phonebook_> jquery is so 2000 and late
[01:03:20] <Whirl3d> cute. It's 4:02 where I live. We stopped helping idiots at 4:00, sorry
[01:03:33] <phonebook_> i just made a three dimensional app that most humans arent even prepared to comprehend is all
[01:03:56] <phonebook_> 4:02. well thats too bad cause i needed help with my... app
[01:04:13] <phonebook_> lol
[01:04:55] <phonebook_> lol to me
[01:05:08] <phonebook_> whirl3d, do you use 3d transforms?
[01:06:20] <Whirl3d> sorry, I am not that smart, I promise.
[01:06:41] <phonebook_> whell, neither am i
[01:06:54] <Kasimir> Somehow I noticed
[01:08:19] <phonebook_> you guys know about 3d transforms and the cool things you can do with them? if not i have at least 5 examples
[01:10:41] <phonebook_> no one gives a fuck. why even bother? let someone else invent it and ill just keep doing my menial labor
[01:10:45] <phonebook_> okay
[01:11:25] <tw2113> the correct answer is "i haven't bothered yet" Whirl3d
[01:11:32] <phonebook_> ah tw
[01:11:48] <phonebook_> you made me so sad with your reply the other day, you really did. i thought about it
[01:12:16] <tw2113> i aim to displease
[01:13:22] <phonebook_> i was just wondering what these posers thought of how to use 3d transforms in a web page
[01:13:24] <kyrix> is this the "current" way of using on/live with ready/load events? https://bitbucket.org/larscorneliussen/jquery.liveready/ ?
[01:14:51] <tw2113> it's a plugin
[01:15:08] <phonebook_> use $(document).on("click", myselector, function() {}); // is the new .live
[01:16:53] <kyrix> phonebook_, on does not support load or ready.
[01:17:09] <kyrix> phonebook_, afaik
[01:17:23] <phonebook_> window.onload = function() {}
[01:17:28] <phonebook_> why is this a problem?
[01:17:30] <tw2113> that's why you call .on() inside a function for .ready()
[01:18:08] <kyrix> phonebook_, i want a function to be called when an element is loaded via ajax. without having to touch the other plugins (modifying their callbacks)
[01:18:17] <tw2113> $(document).ready(function(){ $('a').on('click', function() { //do something}; });
[01:18:33] <kyrix> tw2113, not on click. on load.
[01:18:42] <tw2113> then use load in place of click
[01:18:48] <tw2113> or something
[01:18:53] <kyrix> tw2113, that doesn't seem to work.
[01:18:56] <phonebook_> yeah, are you using .ajax?
[01:19:25] <kyrix> phonebook_, i think so. let me check what the plugin is doing.
[01:19:45] <DrDank> Has anyone successfully coded/found a snipplet that can measure the height of one css div and then adjust another automatically to the other div's height? Ive been looking.. Ive ran across plenty of them.. but they all are fouled and screwed up in some way or another... loosing hope.. lol
[01:20:11] <tw2113> why not find a way to fix the "fouled up" bits DrDank
[01:20:35] <kyrix> phonebook_, yes. .ajax
[01:21:33] <phonebook_> so if you google "jquery ajax" you will see all the possible arguments. but if you provide a success: function() {} that may be what you are looking for. ie your load
[01:21:55] <kyrix> phonebook_, can't modify the plugin.
[01:22:07] <phonebook_> okay so it is exactly this
[01:22:40] <phonebook_> the plugin must provide a callback if it is async. if it is sync you can just put your code after you use the plugin. otherwise you have to implement it
[01:23:46] <kyrix> phonebook_, thats why i said dont want to modify the success callback of the original plugin ;) hmm, nope. i want to access "somehow" the load function independelty. i'm almost there, just looking for the the most efficient way
[01:24:29] <phonebook_> what is the load function?
[01:24:57] <kyrix> event sorry
[01:25:06] <phonebook_> of the window?
[01:25:13] <kyrix> of the elements that are loaded via ajax
[01:25:22] <phonebook_> are the elemtns iframes?
[01:25:25] <kyrix> nope
[01:25:41] <kyrix> images and text.
[01:26:13] <phonebook_> then the load function happens in the same [thread of execution (paraphrased cause i dont know the right word)] at the success function
[01:30:50] <DrDank> Well, does anyone know a good jquery SNIPPLET site?? Im totally dumbfounded on this.. and thats about the only way I can get what I need accomplished. All the snipplets I'm finding are fouled/screwed up in some way or another and I know nothing about editing them.
[01:31:24] <sunbeam> i've got a url that returns a json array
[01:31:35] <phonebook_> thats why plugins suck dick. jquery is constantly changing and browsers are constantly changing
[01:31:36] <sunbeam> how can i assign the result of this url to a javascript variable?
[01:31:52] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/gxkviyjJ here is an example :)
[01:32:14] <Whiskey> When you click on show, do you see that the style is braking, cuz i it change the 02: to Save:
[01:33:26] <Whiskey> Its cuz the SpaceIt function not running when this happen, and i don´t find any good way on execute it when it happens
[01:34:16] <phonebook_> var x = jsonarrayfromurl
[01:35:08] <Whiskey> I can set it in onclick, but then the all other breaks
[01:35:45] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/cwlyhL3x <-- here
[01:37:14] <phonebook_> Whiskey, I dont understand your problem. Most people in programming on irc are not helpful. you basically have to boil the problem down to the most atomic level. and pastebin is better because people are familiar with it
[01:38:28] <phonebook_> jsfiddle, i meant jsfiddle
[01:38:57] <phonebook_> Whiskey, you want to see something i am working on?
[01:39:34] <Whiskey> sure
[01:39:41] * phonebook_ yay
[01:39:58] <Whiskey> phonebook_: look at the 02: when you click on show botton you see that the lines 01/02/03 don´t fill out the border
[01:40:14] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/nNzqraCz <-- more clear example
[01:40:14] <phonebook_> k hold on
[01:41:09] <Sean-Der> For jQuery Mobile what event should I use to insert a element that needs to be styled (ie a navbar) I am trying to split my app up into multi HTML
[01:41:26] <Sean-Der> But I can't find a way to keep transitions, and get the events to fire when I want
[01:42:00] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/43/ <--- there you have it in fiddle
[01:42:04] <phonebook_> $.mobile.activePage.on("pagehide", myFunction);
[01:44:32] <Sean-Der> phonebook_: Is that for me, or are you helping someone else also?
[01:44:50] <phonebook_> that was you. was general vomiting of guidance.
[01:45:23] <phonebook_> post a FIDDLE
[01:45:36] <sunbeam> phonebook_: thanks
[01:46:01] <angryasian> So you want that spaceIt function to run always? / every once in a while?
[01:46:14] <sunbeam> phonebook_: i mean which function do i use?
[01:46:18] <sunbeam> var x = url is no good
[01:46:25] <phonebook_> how are you inserting the element?
[01:46:37] <Whiskey> phonebook_: do you see the problem?
[01:47:09] <phonebook_> whiskey i still dont understand what happens when you press show      when i click it things just get bigger
[01:47:27] <sunbeam> i just need the result/content of that url which is a json array
[01:48:27] <phonebook_> so you do an ajax and then on success you do a function(d)  { d.data = mycontent }?
[01:49:12] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:49:22] <Whiskey> but you see that the rows 1/2/3 and so on are not same size any more
[01:49:32] <Whiskey> it not filling out the border as it did when you firrst come in
[01:51:06] <Whiskey> <div class="infoViewBox">
[01:51:22] <Whiskey> better markup: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/44/
[01:52:02] <Whiskey> phonebook_: its the function spaceIt() { thats need to be executed when you click on it
[01:52:03] <Whiskey> i think
[01:54:30] <Whiskey> phonebock for 100 time
[01:55:37] <phonebook_> man its confusing. sometimes i try to hard to understand
[01:55:58] <Whiskey> :/
[01:56:01] <Whiskey> do you understand now?
[01:56:02] <phonebook_> sry
[01:56:13] <phonebook_> its a nice design for sure
[01:56:38] <Whiskey> do you get what i mean now?
[01:56:42] <Whiskey> always something :)
[01:57:02] <phonebook_> take a break from that console crap and look at my 3d crap
[01:57:25] <phonebook_> second...
[01:59:09] <phonebook_> http://jsfiddle.net/xnBJd/ --- but you can only view it in chrome and safari (maybe firefox)
[01:59:46] <phonebook_> trying to figure out how to bring 3d transforms into a practical ui
[02:01:26] <sunbeam> phonebook_: yes
[02:01:45] <Whiskey> thats alot of code :D
[02:01:47] <phonebook_> okay so you have the raw html you want to inject?
[02:02:11] <phonebook_> im still working on it. still tons of problems. i dont even know what it is yet
[02:03:20] <Whiskey> phonebook_?`
[02:04:08] <phonebook_> i was asking sunbeam. guys i dont know if i know the answers to anyones questions here
[02:04:19] <phonebook_> its like...
[02:06:00] <Whiskey> <div id="block0h" class="dataViewBox-HideShowButton" onclick="magicmushrooms('block0'); spaceIt()">Show</div> <-- that shuld go in to the spaceIt and make the lines width correct
[02:06:16] <Whiskey> But im not sure if it go to fast so it don´t have time to change it
[02:06:48] <phonebook_> the people on these places do sometimes know a lot but its hard to apply that knowledge to a foreign problem. so getting the question as close to something they can solve in a binary way is the quickest way to get the answer. and in the process of getting it to that "binary" level you learn a lot too
[02:09:58] <Mo0O> does every jquery have a callback function implemented ?
[02:10:22] <ilian> Hi
[02:10:42] <Mo0O> ilian: ji
[02:10:44] <ilian> I am using jquery-file-upload but I can not find how to add the loading icon while uploading, any idea?
[02:10:47] <Mo0O> hi
[02:11:19] <Whiskey> No body get what i mean?
[02:13:11] <Whirl3d> phonebook, why aren't you using matrix math to handle your transforms. It'd be a lot faster, about 1/10th the code.
[02:15:57] <Whirl3d> whiskey, I can't believe you are still here asking the same question when I gave you a completely workable example by changing your spans and divs into a simple table.
[02:17:47] <Whiskey> Whirl3d :) no one owkrs :D
[02:18:16] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: But this one works as long style not changed
[02:19:04] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: do yo uthink i wuld be here if i got some other one work the way i wanted it to do?
[02:19:15] <Mo0O> is there a way to implement a callback to the .html() ?
[02:19:53] <Whirl3d> MoOO, what are you trying to accomplish?
[02:20:25] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: i take thats as a no then
[02:20:31] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, I think it must be a language barrier.
[02:20:49] <Whirl3d> I still can't figure out how it is supposed to look versus how it does look
[02:21:08] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/S6Is3GvU <-- Whirl3d that was the best one but it won´t allow me to create a border
[02:21:15] <Whiskey> and spacing
[02:21:18] <Sean-Der> ph8: Sorry for the delay, I can't get it to work :/
[02:21:21] <Sean-Der> http://jsfiddle.net/s2GF4/
[02:21:38] <Sean-Der> The goal is to have javascript insert the navbar, so I don't duplicate data
[02:22:11] <Whirl3d> whiskey, you want the date to touch the second column header?
[02:22:31] <Sean-Der> pagecreate is before the markup has made the enhancements, so I think this is right? But after a couple of page load it stops working
[02:23:04] <Whiskey> no i want like 4px or something between them
[02:23:14] <Whiskey> so its splitted
[02:23:15] <Mo0O> Whirl3d: I'm using $.getJSON() wherein I update a div via .html() and I vant to bind some elements, after .html() put elements in the document
[02:23:47] <Mo0O> s/vant/want/
[02:23:58] <Sean-Der> All my CSS media queries are broken after an ajax load ughh
[02:24:43] <Sean-Der> I might just say screw it and not use the ajax load. I can't figure out how to do things right with seperate HTML files
[02:25:07] <Whirl3d> MoOO, you will have to use the callback for $.getJSON() --place the html() and then do you desired callback
[02:25:10] <becom33> Im doing a get request trough jquery and I want put the return html content to a dialog box . how can I do that
[02:25:20] <sunbeam> i have this string in a variable in javascript, i only need  "geometry" : {
[02:25:21] <sunbeam>             "location" : {
[02:25:27] <sunbeam> from http://pastebin.com/DjBLKRFA
[02:25:41] <sunbeam> how can i access this in javascript (inner array)
[02:25:44] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: thats one is really bad cuz it won´t allow me to have an border anyways
[02:26:39] <Mo0O> Whirl3d: oh, sorry I didn't figure $.getJSON() have a callback, thanks :)
[02:26:49] <becom33> anyone for me ?
[02:27:21] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: http://tinkerbin.com/5nEdTDUw there you have it but then its in the body, thats not good
[02:28:44] <Whirl3d> lemme post a screenshot of what I see. It can't be what you are looking for.
[02:29:58] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: http://tinkerbin.com/AFRW5FuB thats quite close do
[02:30:06] <Whiskey> spacing missing
[02:30:25] <becom33> Im doing a get request trough jquery and I want put the return html content to a dialog box . how can I do that ?
[02:30:34] <becom33> want to *
[02:30:46] <Mo0O> Whirl3d: well, but I'm using the .html() in the $.getJSON() callback, so how can i ensure the html is load ?
[02:31:11] <Whirl3d> http://tinypic.com/r/vdifif/6
[02:31:55] <becom33> man so disappointing , its like accidentally walking into a GAY bar and nobody hits on you
[02:32:07] <Whirl3d> Mo0O, your callback won't fire unless the html content is loaded. If it is, then the callback is called and you can apply it to an element by html() method
[02:32:23] <Whirl3d> becom33, just like a gay bar, you gotta give it a minute
[02:32:33] <Whirl3d> just hold your horses and someone will be able to help.
[02:32:57] <becom33> he he Whirl3d alright mate
[02:33:13] <Whirl3d> whiskey, did you see the screenshot I posted....how is that like what you want?
[02:34:13] <Whirl3d> become33, a standard alert dialog?   in your callback you would say alert(data); where data was the text returned from your load, .ajax, .getJSON() etc.
[02:35:06] <becom33> .get
[02:35:15] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/GG4Lb1FU <-- thats how it shuld look Whirl3d
[02:35:54] <becom33> Whirl3d, Im trying to do that child parent thing like in .net application . main application is the parent and dialogbox is child
[02:36:27] <becom33> I thought jquery dialog box would work fine , (not sure if there are better choice for this )
[02:36:57] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: http://oi45.tinypic.com/jrzpqq.jpg
[02:37:32] <becom33> anyhow Whirl3d its a simple .get request and I want to put the return (data) into a dialog box and set the dialog box width and height it self from the dialogbox it self
[02:37:36] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: the http://tinkerbin.com/GG4Lb1FU is also close, only problem there is that left/right side not is 50%50% always
[02:38:36] <becom33> i mean set the height and width from the dialogbox it self
[02:40:21] <Whirl3d> becom33, I am not familiar with the parent thing like in .net....??
[02:41:09] <Whirl3d> becom33, I think you might want to use $.ajax()
[02:41:17] <becom33> Whirl3d, its fine . just tell me how can add return data from a .get request into a dialogbox and set the dialog box height and width it self
[02:42:29] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: you don´t find it anyway to work right
[02:42:41] <Whirl3d> Is there such a function? .get()
[02:42:48] <Whirl3d> ? .get()
[02:42:49] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[02:43:16] <Whirl3d> that doesn't load external data.  I think you mean .ajax or .load
[02:43:59] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, so you want to adjust the column widths from 50:50 to accommodate the largest line of both columns, right?
[02:44:14] <Whirl3d> So somethimes it'll be 60:40 and sometimes it will be 30:70
[02:44:35] <Whirl3d> but what happens when you can't fit the entire column 1 and column 2 on one line?
[02:45:18] <becom33> Whirl3d, this is what Im using at the moment http://pastie.org/private/zvq5pcidkjt26rnlaw9xq
[02:46:07] <Whirl3d> so your href is going to be something like "#elementid" right?
[02:46:34] <Whiskey> yeh
[02:46:34] <becom33> no its a link
[02:46:37] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: thats correct
[02:46:51] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/DZpzz06L there it just work on left side
[02:46:53] <Whirl3d> becom33, .get will not load content from a url
[02:46:55] <becom33> who are you talking to I have no idea :/
[02:47:08] <becom33> it does :/
[02:47:18] <becom33> not a remote url
[02:47:37] <becom33> just a path, mvc path of the same domain
[02:47:49] <HeN> You're not talking about the same thing, $.get != .get()
[02:48:10] <HeN> $.get is a shortcut for $.ajax
[02:48:24] <Whirl3d> Then what's the issue?
[02:48:24] <becom33> oh hit , sorrt Im talking about $.get
[02:51:57] <becom33> umm Whirl3d well I cant get the return data into a dialog box
[02:52:31] <Whirl3d> becom33, are you able to get the data to load and append correctly?
[02:52:38] <becom33> yes
[02:52:46] <Whirl3d> is there more than one #samplepop?
[02:53:09] <becom33> Whirl3d, well I was thinking without appending the return data is there anyway I can add the return data into the dialog box ?
[02:53:55] <Whirl3d> the return data comes back as text. You can make it into an unattached element var el=$(data); el.dialog();
[02:54:21] <becom33> alright
[02:54:43] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, now that I understand better what you want, give me just a second to look at it.
[02:56:47] <becom33> ok I'll wait
[03:03:00] <Sean-Der> Does anyone have an example of a multi page site in jQuery Mobile? I can only seem to find example code that wants all HTML in one file.
[03:03:25] <Sean-Der> I am making a mess out of my project, it would suck to have to refactor. But I would love just one decent example
[03:04:22] <becom33> Whirl3d, cant use the variable it gives multiple dialogboxes . I guess because of the multiple lines
[03:05:19] <Whirl3d> becom33, you probably have multiple divs in it. So it creates a dialog for each div, I am guessing. Perhaps you can extract just the text and use it.
[03:05:57] <becom33> Whirl3d, not multiple divs in it but have multiple tags
[03:06:34] <Whirl3d> var src=$("<div class='test'/>").text($(data).text()); src.dialog();  ?
[03:07:51] <HeN> becom33: what is your problem?
[03:08:36] <becom33> HeN, the problem is I want the whole content which is coming from the get request to be in the dialogbox
[03:08:47] <becom33> also cant be sure of the div tag id as well
[03:09:59] <becom33> HeN, also I want to set the dialogbox width and height from the request content . I can mention the the the w,h in the return content
[03:10:06] <HeN> becom33: show me your code, an example of the $.get response and why you cant be sure of the div tag id?
[03:10:08] <Whiskey> Whirl3d :)
[03:12:17] <becom33> HeN, this is the return code I got http://pastie.org/private/lrntp8myt1jszzl08tysw
[03:13:47] <becom33> HeN, this is what Im getting on my screen http://postimage.org/image/umeudfi3b/
[03:15:58] <HeN> becom33: show me your code where you call the .dialog()
[03:16:45] <becom33> HeN, http://pastie.org/private/bu5zrhttjk0pmg4rv64eg
[03:17:30] <HeN> becom33: is this site accessible by any chance or are you developing localy?
[03:17:56] <becom33> HeN, localy :/
[03:20:02] <becom33> any chance seen what Im doing wrong
[03:24:10] <becom33> aloo >
[03:25:52] <HeN> becom33: try to use this: $(data).hide().appendTo('body').closest('div').dialog();
[03:26:39] <becom33> it works fine :D
[03:27:52] <becom33> HeN, now I need to set the dialog box w,h trough the return data . I have mentioned a script in the bottom of the return . can we do that ?
[03:28:53] <HeN> becom33: if you ask me I'd use json
[03:29:10] <becom33> HeN, json the return data ?
[03:29:28] <HeN> yes, where is this $.get request going to?
[03:30:35] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: seems like you got problems whit it :D
[03:32:45] <DrDank> For those of you that have been in the chat for a few hours now, I know I already asked this.. but I just can't find anything worth a damn on it.. all the snipplets and such that I find are all jacked up and don't work correctly.. --- I need something that will pull the height of one div (#thumbs) -- and then make another div the EXACT height(#mc) I seen a bunch of snipplets that make the div
[03:32:46] <DrDank> 'stretch/grow' or whatever, but none of them work properly when it comes to stopping.. Any help... suggestions??
[03:33:06] <Whirl3d> whiskey, it's a lot of typing
[03:33:19] <Whiskey> ooo
[03:33:28] <Whirl3d> if you just use tables like I suggested, it does your spacing automatically
[03:33:35] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/d5J2S/11/
[03:34:52] <HeN> DrDank: $('#mc').height($('#thumbs').height())
[03:37:08] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: no you wrong
[03:37:13] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/d5J2S/16/ <--- thats not what i wanted
[03:37:25] <DrDank> Hen, that simple? <script> $('#mc').height($('#thumbs').height()) </script> ??
[03:37:53] <HeN> DrDank: if I understood right then yes
[03:38:01] <Whiskey> the 01: shuld be same width as 02, ,03,04,05,06,07,08,09 and so on
[03:38:12] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, I give up. you are impossible.
[03:38:15] <Whirl3d> good luck.
[03:38:29] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: no im not you told me that you understand
[03:38:49] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/39/ <-- see that example, all have same width
[03:40:41] <DrDank> HeN, I will be giving that a whirl here in just a second.. I sure hope it works.. been searching all night and couldn't find anything worth a damn... --- I need to strap down and try to learn me a little jquery..I know some javascript, well knew.... its been probably about 8-9 years since I have used any of it.... lol.. I'll let cha know in just a few if that worked.. *got fingers crossed.*
[03:42:25] <DrDank> HeN, that was a no go. :( I didn't think it would be that easy. lol :(
[03:43:19] <HeN> DrDank: then I guess I didnt understand what you want, sorry
[03:44:03] <sunbeam> from http://pastebin.com/DjBLKRFA
[03:44:41] <DrDank> HeN, can I private message you?? -- Ive got 2 monitors going.. 2 kids yelling and screaming.. girlfriend bitching and like 15 windows open.. would be much easier.. I could explain better.. would be a great help if you could help me get this working... Been trying it for atleast 6 hrs.
[03:45:01] <HeN> go ahead
[04:19:49] <Sean-Der> Ok so I refactored everything into a single page, and it fixed 99% of my issues. However, I can't figure out what event I should fire for when a web browser loads the entire page

[04:41:43] <becom33> how can I set the dialog box title after loading the dialobox within in the dialog box ?
[04:42:17] * becom33 anyone ?
[04:47:23] <dmarkey> becom33: isnt it just the header?
[04:47:53] <becom33> dmarkey, Im talking about jquery dialog box
[04:59:01] <becom33> Im trying to set dialog box title by doing this . this content is actually is inside the dialogbox it self http://pastie.org/private/dthdrmyzdeyq8nhiu4brsw
[04:59:17] <becom33> HeN,
[04:59:20] <becom33> ?
[04:59:23] <becom33> some help ?
[05:00:28] <Woet> becom33: what is $(this) supposed to be?
[05:04:01] <becom33> actually i just tried with this . coz I didnt have a choice of explaining what I wanted . that html code is inside the dialogbox . I just want set the dialog title using the script inside the dialogbox
[05:04:05] <becom33> Woet,
[05:04:41] <Woet> yes, i know what you want.
[05:04:42] <Woet> becom33: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics
[05:05:07] <Woet> and http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[05:05:49] <sunbeam> console.log(json["results"]["address_components"]);
[05:05:52] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this syntax?
[05:06:23] <becom33> Woet, there was nothing which helped me
[05:06:26] <Woet> sunbeam: i'm going to assume the elements you're mentioning do you exist
[05:06:30] <Woet> becom33: there is, please read it.
[05:06:46] <sunbeam> i get undefined, i use this array http://pastebin.com/Ttb9q1Yn
[05:06:50] <becom33> I know the basics :/
[05:06:54] <sunbeam> Woet: check that
[05:07:00] <Woet> becom33: then why do you use $(this)?
[05:07:13] <Woet> ?demo @ sunbeam
[05:07:14] <bot-t> sunbeam, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:07:26] <becom33> I cant use the "#divid"
[05:07:38] <becom33> because its not just the div it
[05:07:46] <becom33> I know this isnt suppose to be there
[05:07:55] <Woet> becom33: why can't you use #divid?
[05:07:59] <becom33> I just wanted make a point what I wanted .
[05:08:09] <becom33> because its the whole code . not just the div
[05:08:22] <becom33> unless I put the js inside the div
[05:08:27] <becom33> hmm didnt think about that
[05:08:30] <Woet> becom33: what are you talking about
[05:08:40] <Woet> becom33: the javascript doesn't have to be in a div
[05:08:43] <Woet> it shouldn't be
[05:09:08] <Woet> becom33: you do not know the basics.
[05:09:59] <becom33> http://pastebin.com/mnxuW1SP this worked
[05:10:06] <becom33> but thats not how I wanted it :/
[05:10:18] <Woet> becom33: the javascript shouldn't be in the div
[05:10:18] <sunbeam> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/drSds/2/
[05:10:20] <Woet> I just told you this.
[05:10:28] <becom33> yes I know
[05:11:07] <Woet> becom33: then what is the problem?
[05:11:22] <becom33> I told you my problem before
[05:11:38] <Woet> becom33: "unless I put the js inside the div" was your problem
[05:11:46] <Woet> and I've told you several times it doesn't and shouldn't be
[05:12:06] <becom33> man Im really making my self look bad
[05:12:29] <becom33> I was trying to show what I wanted . and and how can it be done in a incorrect way
[05:12:45] <Woet> becom33: then explain your actual issue
[05:12:47] <becom33> i know js shoudnt be in a div
[05:13:25] <Woet> sunbeam: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2921745/how-to-make-cross-domain-ajax-calls-to-google-maps-api
[05:13:32] <Woet> becom33: okay, what is the actual issue?
[05:13:57] <becom33> Woet, well Im using this js http://pastebin.com/xaQDu8VV to get a dialog box . the problem is . I want to set the title from the content which it returns as the data
[05:14:22] <Woet> becom33: so?
[05:14:33] <Woet> becom33: first of all, you can just use title="hello" in the HTML for the title
[05:14:44] <Woet> but you can change the title with the code you showed after the dialog was created
[05:15:04] <sunbeam> Woet: better thanks
[05:15:11] <becom33> content which returns in this http://pastebin.com/1TQfiAdz
[05:16:58] <becom33> Woet, ok what if I wanna set w,h to the dialog box after it was loaded
[05:17:17] <Woet> becom33: just do it?
[05:18:35] <becom33> Woet, this doesnt work in a dialog box style="width:500px"
[05:19:29] <Woet> becom33: indeed, you set it with JS
[05:19:42] <Woet> becom33: as mentioned on the documentation I linked you to
[05:23:25] <becom33> Woet, this ? $('#demopopup').attr('style','width:500px');
[05:24:25] <Woet> becom33: read the documentation.
[05:24:33] <becom33> hmm readin
[05:24:59] <Woet> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[05:32:08] <xGeek> Hello all, i want to change all unlied url to linked url using js.
[05:32:29] <xGeek> i have a small chat box
[05:32:33] <Woet> unlied url to linked url?
[05:32:34] <sunbeam> Woet: how can I assign a var from that result?
[05:32:43] <xGeek> old message are changed but new ones no
[05:32:44] <sunbeam> do I need to return something outside the geocode function?
[05:33:00] <xGeek> sunbeam: change http:www....com
[05:33:02] <xGeek> to
[05:33:07] <Woet> sunbeam: make it a global variable
[05:33:19] <xGeek> <a href="http//w....">..</a>
[05:33:28] <sunbeam> Woet: how
[05:33:31] <Woet> xGeek: not sure why you want to do this client side
[05:33:35] <Woet> xGeek: but http://tech.cibul.net/turn-urls-into-links-in-text-with-jquery/
[05:33:38] <sunbeam> Woet: didn't know that worked in javascript
[05:33:45] <sunbeam> global var = "etc" ; ?
[05:33:47] <Woet> sunbeam: just define it outside the function
[05:33:49] <Woet> sunbeam: no
[05:33:53] <Woet> sunbeam: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/global_variable
[05:34:07] <xGeek> Woet: because i'am not the website owner
[05:34:17] <xGeek> i'am just writing an add-on
[05:34:51] <Woet> xGeek: I gave you the solution too
[05:35:13] <xGeek> that's work even with new message ??
[05:35:33] <Woet> xGeek: ..?
[05:35:51] <xGeek> the problem is that old message are modified
[05:36:01] <Woet> xGeek: okay, so?
[05:36:02] <xGeek> but when something new is added to the page
[05:36:10] <xGeek> nothing happen
[05:36:20] <Woet> xGeek: okay, your question being?
[05:36:39] <xGeek> how to i apply that to all message !
[05:36:42] <xGeek> even new ones
[05:36:52] <Woet> xGeek: by triggering the code I gave you to new messages?
[05:37:52] <xGeek> Woet: the website receive message using ajax and append them to the page
[05:38:10] <Woet> xGeek: okay, trigger that code on the messages retrieved during ajax, then append it.
[05:38:57] <xGeek> it's for facebook chat i don't know how to trigger that code on the messages retrieved during ajax
[05:39:18] <Woet> xGeek: then read the documentation, read tutorials and figure out a way.
[05:42:00] <sunbeam> Woet: i did
[05:42:52] <sunbeam> Woet: do i need to use window.value?
[05:43:25] <sunbeam> hjmm neither works
[05:44:04] <Woet> sunbeam: ?
[05:44:24] <Woet> sunbeam: i recommend the code at the very top
[05:44:33] <Woet> sunbeam: simply defining the variable outside the function

[08:24:51] <duderion> what shall happen in your fiddle?
[08:25:16] <jqueryQueue> im interesting how jquery knows in queue1 about second queue
[08:26:33] <b1lly> its empty
[08:26:42] <jqueryQueue> my fiddle is empty
[08:26:46] <b1lly> ya
[08:27:03] <jqueryQueue> cant be
[08:27:12] <jqueryQueue> just opened it
[08:27:17] <duderion> no its not empty
[08:27:24] <jqueryQueue> yup
[08:27:27] <jqueryQueue> look
[08:27:32] <jqueryQueue> ater i run fadein
[08:27:36] <duderion> on 'run' nothing happens, as there is no text between the som_div tags
[08:27:42] <duderion> take a look at the console
[08:28:32] <jqueryQueue> sorry choose a jquery frameworl
[08:28:39] <jqueryQueue> i didnt select
[08:28:41] <jqueryQueue> my fault
[08:29:16] <b1lly> what do you mean how que 1 nknows about q 2
[08:29:54] <jqueryQueue> after
[08:29:57] <jqueryQueue> fadeIn
[08:30:07] <jqueryQueue> i attach new function to the queue
[08:30:38] <jqueryQueue> and inside this function i print to the console an array of the queue
[08:30:49] <b1lly> there is a queue
[08:30:50] <jqueryQueue> and it returns ['inprogress',function()]
[08:31:17] <b1lly> or a list of objects (functions) that jquery appends too everytime a animation is called
[08:31:18] <jqueryQueue> but how j query knows about second queue -> function()
[08:31:42] <b1lly> it doesnt?
[08:31:59] <jqueryQueue> so why in the array is [inprogres,function()]
[08:32:15] <jqueryQueue> inprogress = current queued and executed func
[08:32:23] <b1lly> aka fadein
[08:32:27] <jqueryQueue> but next item is next queueed func
[08:33:01] <b1lly> fade in is in progress becaues its the first thing you invoked...
[08:33:25] <jqueryQueue> ok but next queue is running just after
[08:33:30] <jqueryQueue> fadeIn
[08:33:34] <b1lly> yes
[08:33:40] <jqueryQueue> and in that queue
[08:33:53] <jqueryQueue> when im printing $(this).queue
[08:34:05] <b1lly> your not printing anything about that que
[08:34:07] <jqueryQueue> it returns [inprogress = witch is my queue]
[08:34:16] <duderion> jqueryQueue: after running the first queue, the 'in progress' string is in position 0 of the running queue
[08:34:19] <jqueryQueue> anf cuntion
[08:34:34] <jqueryQueue> ok and the second element
[08:34:35] <jqueryQueue> ?
[08:34:43] <jqueryQueue> i know that
[08:34:51] <duderion> the queue is a FIFO
[08:34:58] <jqueryQueue> but how jquery in that position knows about second queue
[08:35:10] <jqueryQueue> i know
[08:35:39] <b1lly> i think you're confusing yourself with your question
[08:35:40] <jqueryQueue> no its LIFO i quess
[08:35:54] <jqueryQueue> its typical queue
[08:36:36] <duderion> here, you'll find detailed info about queues
[08:36:36] <jqueryQueue> on anywa
[08:36:36] <duderion> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1058158/can-somebody-explain-jquery-queue-to-me
[08:36:52] <duderion> in the first answer
[08:39:18] <jqueryQueue> ok u are right
[08:39:21] <jqueryQueue> but
[08:39:22] <Whiskey> :D
[08:39:23] <jqueryQueue> explain me
[08:39:46] <jqueryQueue> why jquery in first custom queue print array
[08:40:03] <b1lly> ?
[08:40:08] <jqueryQueue> and the second elem is a next function
[08:40:10] <duderion> this in progress thing ?
[08:41:46] <jqueryQueue> queue(function{  // lets say 1  console.log()->  [inprogress,function() -> next queue] }).queue( //lets say 2 )
[08:42:31] <jqueryQueue> and im curious how in first queue it knows about second function
[08:42:37] <b1lly> it doesnt
[08:42:42] <jqueryQueue> grr
[08:42:50] <jqueryQueue> but it show in array
[08:42:54] <b1lly> oh
[08:42:57] <jqueryQueue> second elem
[08:43:00] <jqueryQueue> func
[08:43:06] <b1lly> you have to read the source
[08:43:08] <jqueryQueue> and toString
[08:43:22] <b1lly> theres a function in the jquery source
[08:43:26] <b1lly> that manages the queue
[08:43:33] <jqueryQueue> i know and i saw it
[08:43:46] <jqueryQueue> its strange becouse
[08:43:50] <jqueryQueue> when i run
[08:44:15] <jqueryQueue> fadeIn(function(){   its only print [inprogress]   }).fadeOut()
[08:44:23] <jqueryQueue> dont know about second queue
[08:44:27] <jqueryQueue> strange
[08:45:12] <jqueryQueue> duderion?
[08:46:36] <duderion> i'm out ;]
[08:46:48] <jqueryQueue> why
[08:59:11] <Whiskey> Im stuck
[08:59:29] <Whiskey> i come nowhere whit this jQuery code
[08:59:42] <duderion> which which
[08:59:47] <duderion> with which query code
[09:00:20] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/51/ <-- that one
[09:00:57] <duderion> ok
[09:00:59] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/53/ <-- that one is more correct
[09:01:26] <Whiskey> You see the row 01/02/03/04/05/06 and so on to 12 is equal sized
[09:01:53] <duderion> yes
[09:02:05] <Whiskey> You also see them is around a border
[09:02:05] <hip2p> Let's say I want to have gold stars horizontally fill my browser screen, one by one. Is there a way for jquery to detect the edge of the screen and begin a new row of stars rather than running off the screen?
[09:02:26] <duderion> i see a bottom border
[09:02:29] <Whiskey> duderion: but the border is bigger then the rows, so its a huge none used space
[09:02:59] <Whiskey> maybe 60% unused
[09:03:17] <duderion> ah you mean the room within the box "this is a javascript test
[09:03:25] <duderion> is 60% unused
[09:03:35] <Whiskey> yeh
[09:03:43] <Whiskey> its not fill the box up right
[09:03:48] <duderion> yes
[09:03:54] <Whiskey> thats why i try to slove
[09:03:57] <duderion> shall the number of lines be flexible
[09:04:03] <duderion> and the room shall always be filled?
[09:04:03] <Whiskey> yeh
[09:04:07] <Whiskey> yeh
[09:04:09] <duderion> ok
[09:04:29] <Whiskey> but every line always be 50% on left and 50% on right side
[09:04:39] <Whiskey> so them always equal sized
[09:05:15] <duderion> i think you should calc how many lines match in one column
[09:05:20] <jqueryQueue> hip2p
[09:05:28] <jqueryQueue> of course u can
[09:06:04] <Whiskey> duderion, i don´t understand
[09:06:18] <duderion> and then numlines / linespercolumn (div-operator)
[09:06:23] <duderion> is the number of columns
[09:06:35] <duderion> and then mainwidth/columns is the width per column
[09:06:42] <hip2p> jqueryQueue what would I use to detect the edge of the screen or to know how wide the visible area is?
[09:06:46] <Whiskey> duderion: "var infoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').prop('offsetWidth');" <-- that will tell the total width of the box, then just use 50%/50% of that space if box bigger then the rows shuld be easy
[09:07:00] <jqueryQueue> hip2p
[09:07:08] <Whiskey> duderion: im not a js coder i just know how to fix it i think :(
[09:07:22] <duderion> your code is completely mixed
[09:07:28] <jqueryQueue> $(window).height and width
[09:07:30] <duderion> jqyuery and plain js
[09:07:41] <jqueryQueue> and (window).scrollTop
[09:07:50] <hip2p> jqueryQueue ok thanks
[09:07:54] <jqueryQueue> $(window).scrollLeft
[09:08:17] <Whiskey> duderion first wee need to know how mutch wiidth the 1 line use after them changed in the state them are now how do i get that?
[09:08:18] <jqueryQueue> and u must get posiiotn of your elelemnt
[09:08:22] <Whiskey> width of 1 line
[09:08:28] <jqueryQueue> and check
[09:08:43] <jqueryQueue> if it is between those border
[09:09:37] <b1lly> hip2p: yeah, but that's more of a CSS thing
[09:10:03] <jqueryQueue> no its easy
[09:10:15] <b1lly> jqueryQueue: He shouldn't use javascript when he doesn't need too
[09:10:18] <hip2p> oh hmm. I found a tutorial on jquery.com that discusses what jqueryQueue is talking about. Apparently CSS has issues witht his
[09:10:28] <hip2p> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/filling-the-visible-content-area
[09:10:28] <b1lly> hip2p: you're wrong
[09:11:05] <jqueryQueue> hip2p u whant to detect if eleement across the border
[09:11:14] <jqueryQueue> and then do something, right?
[09:11:20] <b1lly> he just wants elements to goto new row
[09:11:21] <hip2p> yeah
[09:11:28] <jqueryQueue> so lookk
[09:11:38] <jqueryQueue> inViewpoint(elem)
[09:12:12] <jqueryQueue> var w_width = $(window).width();
[09:12:28] <hip2p> yeah what you're talking about is similar to that tutorial
[09:12:38] <jqueryQueue> var visible_width = w_width + $(window).scrollLeft()
[09:12:58] <jqueryQueue> and then u need to always check currrent element
[09:13:06] <hip2p> right
[09:13:15] <jqueryQueue> var curr_elem = $(curr-elem).position.left
[09:13:32] <jqueryQueue> + of courrse element outerWidth
[09:13:38] <hip2p> awesome thanks
[09:13:45] <jqueryQueue> u welcome
[09:14:19] <mats_> Can anyone see what's causing the weird font behavior during the transition in the slider i use? http://www.tram7.se/
[09:15:39] <jqueryQueue> gosh i had a headache
[09:15:49] <jqueryQueue> i must take some pills
[09:15:51] <jqueryQueue> ;<
[09:16:03] <mats_> it's on me
[09:21:09] <ohcibi> hi i need to tweak my site for ie support.. i have a little styled checkbox which doesnt work because <=IE8 wont change the status of the checkbox by clicking on the label if the checkbox is not displayed. i just want to make the checkbox visible if browser <=IE8, jquery doc says jquery.browser will be deprecated in future... is it possible to do this with detecting some browsers feature?
[09:23:40] <b1lly> hip2p: http://jsfiddle.net/a5JGa/
[09:23:47] <b1lly> you dont need js detection
[09:24:08] <jqueryQueue> ohcibi
[09:24:24] <jqueryQueue> Modernizer
[09:24:31] <jqueryQueue> its all u need
[09:25:13] <jqueryQueue> billy
[09:25:24] <jqueryQueue> but u can simply use floats
[09:25:26] <mulch2> !rules
[09:25:31] <jqueryQueue> css floats
[09:25:37] <b1lly> that's what im using...
[09:25:45] <ohcibi> jqueryQueue: i'm using modernizr, which feature should i test?
[09:25:48] <b1lly> thats what i'm showing him
[09:25:49] <jqueryQueue> o
[09:25:52] <jqueryQueue> but
[09:26:11] <b1lly> there's no reason to use JS to do what he's trying to do
[09:26:12] <jqueryQueue> ohcibi
[09:26:17] <jqueryQueue> ok
[09:26:34] <jqueryQueue> billy but i thought he need t odetect inview
[09:26:38] <duderion> modernize is really cool
[09:26:40] <duderion> r
[09:26:59] <jqueryQueue> yes it is
[09:27:23] <jqueryQueue> look at modernizer u can customize it
[09:27:47] <jqueryQueue> and pick a element detection u need
[09:27:51] <Danny> Good Evening! I'd like to develop a GUI with the help of jquery and jquery UI. is there anywhere a widget available, which helps so design a top area, menu area, footer and content? Or a splitter control or somethine like that?
[09:28:07] <jqueryQueue> u can also create your own detect func
[09:29:56] <ohcibi> jqueryQueue: i know this, i have looked through all the features of modernizr and didnt saw anything what i could use, plus i dont know how to detect if a browser is able to change the status of hidden inputs by clicking on their labels
[09:30:36] <mulch2> i hope i'm not out of line, but i have a problem i'm sure you guys could solve in your sleep:
[09:30:46] <mulch2> i have a search box form on my wordpress theme (in header.php) that i want to validate so that a user must eenter 6 characters before they can even submit the search (clicking the button or hitting enter).
[09:30:56] <mulch2> i tried php, but realized that it's server side and would have to process the form before it could validate it. so i tried jquery, and i ended up finding 2 *seemingly* perfect plugins, however, after following the instructions (in my mind), i cannot get the things to work! no matter what, i am still able to submit any search i want, as if nothing has changed :(
[09:31:00] <ruz1> #stackoverflow
[09:31:14] <mulch2> here's the search box form code:
[09:31:16] <mulch2> http://pastebin.com/uSS4miWE
[09:32:41] <mulch2> thanks to anyone who might feel generous enough to help -- i can't express how nuts this is driving me!
[09:33:29] <kayloos> theres no javascript in your pastie
[09:33:40] <jqueryQueue> ohcibi
[09:33:59] <b1lly> mulch
[09:34:00] <jqueryQueue> one again what u would like to detect ?
[09:34:34] <mulch2> hey, b1lly
[09:34:59] <ohcibi> jqueryQueue: if the browser is able to change the status of a hidden checkbox when clicking the label for that checkbox
[09:35:51] <b1lly> $('form').submit(function() { if ($('input[name="s"]').val().length < 6) { alert('Search string is too short!'); return false; } });
[09:36:13] <jqueryQueue> ohcibi
[09:36:26] <jqueryQueue> but use just jquery for it
[09:36:42] <jqueryQueue> dont base on the browser feature
[09:36:44] <jqueryQueue> i think
[09:37:12] <jqueryQueue> just set attr of ti to checkec==checked
[09:37:18] <jqueryQueue> or prop checked t otrue
[09:37:45] <jqueryQueue> prop("checked",true)
[09:37:52] <jqueryQueue> on hidden checkbox
[09:37:55] <jqueryQueue> thats all
[09:38:09] <jqueryQueue> let jquery to do the rest
[09:38:34] <jqueryQueue> dont bother with it
[09:38:37] <mulch2> sweet, b1lly! -- would i activate that between the <head></head> tags in my header.php file?
[09:39:16] <jqueryQueue> mulch2 u mean that form submit
[09:39:17] <jqueryQueue> ?
[09:39:23] <mulch2> yeah
[09:39:25] <jqueryQueue> suer
[09:39:36] <jqueryQueue> sure but
[09:39:48] <jqueryQueue> better solution is to put it just before body
[09:39:49] <jqueryQueue> close tag
[09:40:10] <jqueryQueue> and for be sure thad DOM  is properly loaded
[09:40:19] <mulch2> sorry for my ignorance, but i would have to still load javascript, right?
[09:40:32] <jqueryQueue> wrap it in $(function(){  // paste your code here })
[09:40:46] <b1lly> mulch2: the bottom of the page
[09:40:50] <jqueryQueue> u need to load jquery
[09:40:51] <b1lly> beofre </body>
[09:40:58] <jqueryQueue> jest
[09:41:07] <b1lly> but you can also put it in the header, but would need to wrap it in a "document ready function"
[09:41:08] <jqueryQueue> <script></script></body>
[09:41:17] <mulch2> sweet!
[09:41:27] <jqueryQueue> right
[09:41:49] <mulch2> and does the actual $('form').submit(function() need to be enclosed in something?
[09:41:56] <jqueryQueue> no
[09:44:46] <happyface> I'm having a strange problem where ajax calls get messed up if I type in Chrome's address bar (which sends GET requests to cache other parts of my site)
[09:45:09] <mouses> is it better practice to set the margin-bottom of a top row set of thumbails or the margin-top of the bottom row set?
[09:45:25] <mouses> visually, looks the same but i want to know whats recommende
[09:45:29] <Kcko_wrk> how do I know if the mouse cursor is over a certain element of time? (at least 3 seconds, and if so, something happens .. and if not so not)  thx
[09:46:16] <jqueryQueue> Kcko
[09:46:37] <jqueryQueue> time diferrent between mouseenter/mouse leave
[09:47:13] <jqueryQueue> or setInterval
[09:47:26] <jqueryQueue> after 1000ms
[09:48:11] <jqueryQueue> and if it run 3 times it means it left 3secons then clearInterval and run your happines
[09:48:54] <Kcko_wrk> jqueryQueue -- good idea, i will try
[09:48:57] <Kcko_wrk> :-)
[09:50:52] <mulch2> okay, b1lly and jqueryQueue: since it's wordpress, the body tag closes in another file (footer.php), so i just tried to put the code in the header, wrapped as you said:
[09:50:54] <jqueryQueue> default fx queue includes animate() methood too
[09:50:56] <mulch2> http://jsfiddle.net/wfyD9/
[09:51:21] <mulch2> atm, it's still not working for me -- i'm not sure what i'm screwing up, but thanks for being patient with me, guys
[09:51:37] <jqueryQueue> wait
[09:52:28] <jqueryQueue> can u past html too
[09:52:31] <jqueryQueue> its important
[09:52:31] <happyface> anyone ever have a problem with Chrome's address bar preloading affecting ajax requests?
[09:52:43] <jqueryQueue> becouse its important
[09:53:02] <jqueryQueue> to know if input it really name 's'
[09:53:12] <ohcibi> okay i've loaded a stylesheet with modernizr but its not applied as stylesheet, whats wrong?
[09:53:23] <mulch2> jqueryQuere: http://pastebin.com/uSS4miWE
[09:55:41] <jqueryQueue> hmm it should work
[09:55:56] <mulch2> strange
[09:57:06] <djQuery> mulch2, see ?preventDefault
[09:57:07] <bot-t> mulch2, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:57:25] <jqueryQueue> djQuery
[09:57:41] <jqueryQueue> no i should work by teturn value too
[09:57:52] <djQuery> no it shouldnt
[09:57:53] <jqueryQueue> if you preventDwefalt
[09:57:56] <jqueryQueue> it wont run
[09:58:04] <jqueryQueue> if u run prevent
[09:58:22] <jqueryQueue> it wont be sent even if the length is greater than 6
[09:58:37] <jqueryQueue> so this code looks right for me
[09:58:49] <djQuery> mulch2, http://jsfiddle.net/wfyD9/1/
[10:01:10] <mulch2> i changed it, djQuery, but still not working :(
[10:01:18] <jqueryQueue> i tell u
[10:01:19] <jqueryQueue> ł=
[10:01:22] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[10:01:49] <jqueryQueue> mulch2 but whats happen
[10:01:51] <mulch2> i double-checked to make sure i had the js file in folder also
[10:01:54] <jqueryQueue> when u run that code
[10:01:59] <djQuery> mulch2, hmmm its working here http://jsfiddle.net/wfyD9/2/
[10:02:07] <jqueryQueue> but check your console
[10:02:13] <jqueryQueue> maybe u have some erro
[10:02:14] <djQuery> did you forget the e that I added to the function
[10:02:17] <jqueryQueue> before that
[10:02:32] <mulch2> if i enter 2 chars into the search box and hit enter, it'll still take me to search results page
[10:02:53] <jqueryQueue> ok
[10:03:01] <jqueryQueue> did u check your conole
[10:03:15] <mulch2> what do you mean by that, exactly?
[10:03:19] <jqueryQueue> firebug/chrome/dragonfly/IE
[10:03:45] <mulch2> i checked on safari and firefox
[10:03:46] <jqueryQueue> what kind of browser
[10:04:06] <jqueryQueue> ok and do u use firebug ?
[10:04:17] <jqueryQueue> or native chrome developer extension
[10:04:18] <jqueryQueue> ?
[10:04:24] <mulch2> native
[10:04:32] <jqueryQueue> yes build in
[10:04:34] <jqueryQueue> i mean
[10:04:39] <jqueryQueue> in chrome
[10:04:47] <jqueryQueue> tool for programme
[10:05:24] <mulch2> no, i'm using it with default everything
[10:05:53] <jqueryQueue> becouse u must to check if u havent error above your code
[10:06:07] <mulch2> i see
[10:06:19] <jqueryQueue> this can break your code
[10:06:28] <jqueryQueue> and even not run it
[10:06:29] <jqueryQueue> u know
[10:06:49] <mulch2> i understand
[10:06:53] <jqueryQueue> download extension for firefox -> Firebug
[10:06:59] <mulch2> k, doing it now
[10:07:00] <djQuery> console is ur friend
[10:07:04] <jqueryQueue> yup
[10:07:20] <djQuery> ALERT is for suckers
[10:07:48] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[10:08:18] <mulch2> lol
[10:08:34] <jqueryQueue> mulch or put your code top most
[10:08:38] <mulch2> i feel like such an idiot, but thanks for being cool about it, guys. you're awesome
[10:08:40] <jqueryQueue> just after jquery
[10:08:58] <jqueryQueue> then u will be sure there is no code above

[10:09:37] <jqueryQueue> start that way
[10:09:41] <jqueryQueue> sorry for my english
[10:09:46] <jqueryQueue> btw
[10:09:51] <mulch2> np at all
[10:10:34] <djQuery> and by the way this comes up all the time and e.preventDefault() is allways the answer
[10:11:17] <jqueryQueue> yes u can use it as a replacement for return true/false
[10:11:21] <jqueryQueue> uright
[10:11:25] <jqueryQueue> djQuery

[10:24:31] <jqueryQueue> becouse he would not win election
[10:24:46] <jqueryQueue> law*
[10:25:17] <jqueryQueue> anyway mulch2
[10:25:24] <jqueryQueue> whats the situation
[10:25:25] <home_> yeah
[10:25:29] <jqueryQueue> ;>
[10:25:36] <home_> anyway, back to #jquery
[10:25:38] <djQuery> he is volcal on it now because he has won election
[10:25:44] <djQuery> yes back to topic
[10:25:53] <jqueryQueue> yup;>
[10:26:01] <home_> :>
[10:29:35] <djQuery> how do I get the index of something, say the index of I highlighted li in a ul
[10:29:51] <jqueryQueue> $(ul li).index(this)
[10:30:06] <jqueryQueue> where this is the curr index
[10:30:44] <djQuery> thats just it I know which li but not the index of the li
[10:31:36] <jqueryQueue> u can run each(index,domElem) on than elem and then u have index
[10:31:40] <jqueryQueue> curr index
[10:31:57] <jqueryQueue> and previous example index in collecion
[10:32:12] <djQuery> could have sworn the was an easier way
[10:32:21] <jqueryQueue> hah hmm
[10:32:41] <djQuery> ?index
[10:32:41] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:33:27] <jqueryQueue> oh righrt
[10:33:32] <jqueryQueue> just run index() on that element
[10:33:37] <jqueryQueue> with no arg
[10:33:46] <becom33> can anyone tell me why jquery ui is bigger than whats in the download site ?
[10:34:06] <jqueryQueue> duno
[10:34:19] <djQuery> did you get the compressed or debug ver
[10:34:49] <mulch2> okay, djQuery and jqueryQueue, it seems to be something up with my wordpress theme. I even replaced my form with yours, dj, and it still won't validate.
[10:35:15] <becom33> djQuery, Im not if ur askin me . I got the ThemeRoller
[10:35:17] <jqueryQueue> maybe its wordpress
[10:35:18] <mulch2> any ideas what might be stopping it?
[10:35:41] <jqueryQueue> are u sure that jquery is loaded?
[10:35:42] <becom33> but its defferent than what I downloaded . fonts and everythin is bigger
[10:35:55] <djQuery> mulch2, see ?validation
[10:36:03] <djQuery> ?validate
[10:36:06] <djQuery> hmmm
[10:36:17] <menikmati> whats a good practice when it comes to comments? would it be bad to comment almost every line of code?
[10:36:25] <mulch2> j, i loaded it with <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script> in the header
[10:36:42] <mulch2> dj, what do you mean by ?validation
[10:36:49] <djQuery> menikmati, unless you are building a tutorial or something then yes every line of comments is bad
[10:37:17] <jqueryQueue> mulch2 but check in Firebug
[10:37:24] <jqueryQueue> in the tab Net
[10:37:28] <jqueryQueue> for js
[10:37:28] <djQuery> if you are having to comment that much maybe you are using a good enough naming schema
[10:38:19] <djQuery> mulch2, run it in chrome and hit the f12 key on ur keyboard, then click on the console button at the bottom of the screen
[10:38:29] <mulch2> oh, snap, Firebug just said that jquery-1.8.3.min.js is not found!
[10:38:42] <djQuery> doh
[10:38:45] <jqueryQueue> and u get your answer
[10:38:49] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[10:38:50] <jqueryQueue> haha
[10:38:56] <mulch2> lol...
[10:38:58] <mulch2> yikes
[10:39:04] * mulch2 covers his face
[10:39:06] <djQuery> I dont test anything without console ope
[10:39:07] <djQuery> n
[10:39:16] <jqueryQueue> facepalm
[10:39:18] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[10:39:20] <mulch2> Firebug is sweet
[10:39:24] <jqueryQueue> yup
[10:39:29] <becom33> anyone for me ?
[10:39:38] <mulch2> haha, okay, now lemme fix this and hopefully i have good news, guys!
[10:39:43] <jqueryQueue> wrong path or just include the hosted jquery
[10:39:43] <djQuery> have you looked at some of the new feats of chrome
[10:39:51] <jqueryQueue> for fresh version
[10:40:01] <djQuery> I never include my own ver of jquery
[10:40:17] <djQuery> I always used a hosted one
[10:40:20] <jqueryQueue> ok
[10:40:22] <jqueryQueue> but
[10:40:24] <jqueryQueue> djQuery
[10:40:47] <jqueryQueue> if  code in lib will change
[10:40:53] <menikmati> ok i'll keep that in mind. i started out comment every line so i can use like ctrl+f to search and get through the code faster if i need to make edits
[10:41:05] <djQuery> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js"></script>
[10:41:46] <jqueryQueue> i think the best practice is to load hosted file and where ther is no jQuery in DOM
[10:41:55] <mulch2> is it better to link to jquery.com, djQuery?
[10:41:56] <jqueryQueue> then load from locally document.write
[10:42:10] <djQuery> no its better to link to google.com
[10:42:14] <jqueryQueue> or yepnope or other source loader
[10:42:31] <djQuery> think of how many others have allready done that
[10:42:33] <jqueryQueue> djQuery i vae a quesion
[10:42:33] <jqueryQueue> ?
[10:42:46] <djQuery> so jquery winds up allready cached
[10:42:58] <mulch2> ah
[10:42:59] <jqueryQueue> if u are using hosted version
[10:43:11] <jqueryQueue> it always brings u newer version?
[10:43:15] <djQuery> and google sets the timeout to like 2 years or so
[10:43:22] <jqueryQueue> if jquery will change?
[10:43:23] <djQuery> no
[10:43:32] <jqueryQueue> ok becouse its important
[10:43:39] <djQuery> well it depends on how you linked to it
[10:44:02] <jqueryQueue> dj
[10:44:04] <djQuery> if you linked to /1/whatever.js    you will alwys get newest version
[10:44:16] <jqueryQueue> but locally is faster than hosted i think
[10:44:25] <wroathe> HTML5 Boilerplate has a recommendation for the best practice.
[10:44:26] <jqueryQueue> i know
[10:44:28] <djQuery> if you linked to /1.3.4/whatever you get exact revision no matter what
[10:44:35] <jqueryQueue> ok great
[10:45:11] <wroathe> Load jQuery from CDN, test for window.jQuery, if window.jQuery doesn't exist then doc.write <script> linking to local jQuery
[10:45:13] <jqueryQueue> i asked becouse i always use local version
[10:45:24] <jqueryQueue> yup
[10:45:25] <djQuery> did you notice that I left the http: offa my links?
[10:45:38] <jqueryQueue> no
[10:45:45] <djQuery> they arent needed
[10:45:47] <wroathe> <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/js/vendor/jquery-1.8.0.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[10:45:59] <wroathe> For example.
[10:46:02] <jqueryQueue> djQuery ?
[10:46:03] <jqueryQueue> why
[10:46:21] <jqueryQueue> when i copy it it comes with https://
[10:46:22] <djQuery> say you run a secure copy and an insecure copy
[10:46:23] <jqueryQueue> protocol
[10:47:02] <jqueryQueue> ok i will keep in mind
[10:47:05] <djQuery> the browser is smart enough to add teh correct http: or https: to the start of the link depending on which you are on
[10:47:20] <jqueryQueue> didnt know
[10:47:21] <mulch2> guys... i've got some news...
[10:47:24] <mulch2> IT WORKED!!
[10:47:27] <jqueryQueue> yup?
[10:47:29] <jqueryQueue> haha
[10:47:40] <jqueryQueue> good 4 u
[10:47:52] <mulch2> only took me 75 hours to find you guys, haha!
[10:48:46] <jqueryQueue> life
[10:48:50] <jqueryQueue> its life
[10:48:52] <jqueryQueue> ;)

[10:49:15] <mulch2> why are you so much nicer than the ppl on efnet?
[10:49:17] <mulch2> lol

[10:49:47] <mulch2> they wouldve ran me out of the chan by now
[10:50:12] <mulch2> thanks a lot, i mean it!
[10:50:14] <jqueryQueue> some ppl sont like to share they knowledge
[10:50:21] <mulch2> nope
[10:50:52] <mulch2> i love to learn, but sometimes i just get stuck. now i'm motivated to learn java/php like you guys.
[10:51:05] <jqueryQueue> php is easy
[10:51:07] <jqueryQueue> for real
[10:51:20] <jqueryQueue> java is much difficult
[10:51:28] <mulch2> wordpress has been a pain, but i'm getting better
[10:51:34] <mulch2> java, i'm still at rock bottom
[10:51:59] <mulch2> i usually just use java plugins and follow the directions
[10:52:08] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[10:52:12] <mulch2> so never learned the right way, lol
[10:52:19] <mulch2> but i'm gonna do it now
[10:52:29] <becom33> anyone why am I getting text and title bars biggers than what I downloaded ?
[10:52:40] <jqueryQueue> becom33
[10:52:44] <jqueryQueue> u mean font size
[10:52:50] <becom33> yes
[10:53:00] <jqueryQueue> diff from than u are build in themerolovver
[10:53:12] <jqueryQueue> if so its strange
[10:53:30] <jqueryQueue> maybe some other css
[10:53:35] <jqueryQueue> change the size
[10:53:44] <jqueryQueue> u can see in firefox->firebug
[10:53:59] <jqueryQueue> what override it
[10:56:33] <jqueryQueue> becom33 do u have other css in your site
[10:56:41] <jqueryQueue> ?
[11:19:54] <jqueryQueue> do u guys now which file loader is good?
[11:20:12] <jqueryQueue> i have got yepnope.sjs
[11:20:26] <jqueryQueue> but i have heard than ReguireJS is better
[11:20:36] <jqueryQueue> do u have any experience about it?
[11:42:02] <Tomashe> hey guys im using some rotation plugin the issue is that on IE it fuckes up my other code, and on FF and Chrome all working well.. there is a way to debug it? or anyone knows some good ratation plugin?
[11:44:35] <menikmati> whats an alternative way to use ++
[11:45:54] <shoky> you can sit on it, cook with it, pleasure your wife with it
[11:45:55] <wroathe> +=
[11:46:47] <wroathe> shoky += your_wife = miserable_shoky
[11:46:56] <shoky> ;p
[11:48:23] <zubelgenubi> can anyone help me remove the default close button that is auto-generated on a jquery mobile dialog?
[11:50:22] <jqueryQueue> use css for it
[11:50:24] <jqueryQueue> zube
[11:50:33] <zubelgenubi> hmm    k...
[11:50:47] <jqueryQueue> with !important
[11:51:05] <jqueryQueue> display: none
[11:51:27] <jqueryQueue> $(".btn_handler").remove()
[11:51:53] <zubelgenubi> k does that javascript inject css, or do I need the rule also?
[11:53:27] <BoarderX> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/remove-close-button-on-jqueryui-dialog
[11:58:09] <zubelgenubi> Thanks jqueryQueue and BoarderX, this gets me going in the right direction...
[11:58:30] <jqueryQueue> just remove it using css
[11:58:40] <jqueryQueue> it cant be difficult i guess
[11:58:59] <jqueryQueue> if u have loaded jquery
[12:00:14] <zubelgenubi> the trouble is that there's no id for the specific button I want to remove.  Just header bar button classes.
[12:00:23] <zubelgenubi> and I want header bars, just not that one...
[12:01:07] <jqueryQueue> can u make jsfiddle
[12:01:13] <jqueryQueue> jsfddle.net
[12:01:19] <jqueryQueue> past html there
[12:01:35] <jqueryQueue> and return here fiddle
[12:02:07] <zubelgenubi> well, thats kindof tough I'm using codeigniter so my source is in different files
[12:02:17] <jillesme> Hey guys, I'm working on a IMDB search app in JS, but the "API" they have returns JSON as text/html, so I get this error: Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[12:02:30] <zubelgenubi> but I can post to generated markup from the browser
[12:02:45] <zubelgenubi> would that work?
[12:02:46] <jillesme> I can't change the headers send by IMDB because well I'm not IMDB
[12:02:53] <SlexAxton> jqueryQueue: requirejs is a better solution to script loading than yepnope
[12:03:02] <jillesme> How would I fix this?
[12:03:06] <SlexAxton> but yepnope is a lot easier to get started on
[12:03:08] <shoky> jillesme: then change the 'dataType' to json i guess..?
[12:03:09] <jqueryQueue> yup but i need
[12:03:13] <jqueryQueue> file loader
[12:03:17] <jqueryQueue> not just js loader
[12:03:24] <SlexAxton> what kind of files?
[12:03:34] <jqueryQueue> js/css
[12:03:43] <SlexAxton> there's a css plugin for require
[12:03:53] <jqueryQueue> oh
[12:03:57] <tw2113> is requirejs built into modernizr?
[12:04:01] <jqueryQueue> and what about LABJS
[12:04:02] <shoky> jillesme: or is that a jsonp API
[12:04:02] <jqueryQueue> ?
[12:04:15] <SlexAxton> here's one version
[12:04:15] <SlexAxton> https://github.com/tyt2y3/requirejs-css-plugin
[12:04:33] <SlexAxton> labjs is not going to solve anything that the other two don't
[12:04:48] <jillesme> shoky: Yeah but how can I use dataType in getJSON.. I think it's an $.ajax API
[12:05:26] <shoky> jillesme: getJSON already sets the dataType to json. but, i see that it's getting interpreted as a Script, which is why i asked if it's a JSONP api
[12:05:43] <jillesme> shoky: Oh, I guess it is than
[12:05:45] <jillesme> then*
[12:05:48] <shoky> jillesme: what does the URL look like?
[12:05:58] <ruz1> anyone good on twitter Anywhere API?
[12:06:01] <shoky> jillesme: and don't guess. if you dont know say you dont know
[12:06:17] <ruz1> i would like to build up a simple twitter connect button with Anywhere api
[12:06:37] <ruz1> can't understand if is possible to do as for fb or g+, ajax call
[12:06:53] <tw2113> this "twitter anywhere" thing? https://dev.twitter.com/docs/anywhere/welcome
[12:07:04] <ruz1> yep
[12:07:11] <tw2113> see the big message at the top?
[12:07:29] <shoky> jillesme:  ok that's not a jsonp api
[12:07:57] <ruz1> oh ops
[12:08:12] <ruz1> any way to implement an ajax oauth for the twitter oauth?
[12:08:15] <tw2113> figured it'd be good to point that out before you spent too much time with it
[12:08:27] <ruz1> i have made them for fb and g+, don't know how to start for twitter
[12:08:47] <ruz1> @tw2113 oh sure
[12:08:49] <ruz1> thx
[12:09:08] <ruz1> any tutorial on how to authenticate users with twitter oauth and ajax/jquery?
[12:09:15] <ruz1> i found only php not ajax
[12:09:17] <ruz1> damn
[12:09:38] <mats_> what's the best way to see why a script behaves different in chrome than in any other browser?
[12:10:01] <ruz1> @mats_ checking console logs ihihi
[12:10:07] <ruz1> and errors
[12:11:20] <ruz1> @tw2113 ever used twitter oauth?
[12:11:24] <mats_> ruz1: thanks. never done "debugging" earlier so no idea how it works :)
[12:11:26] <tw2113> nope
[12:11:35] <ruz1> np
[12:11:38] <ruz1> and
[12:11:39] <tw2113> i tend to use the json endpoints that don't require oauth
[12:11:39] <ruz1> np
[12:12:01] <ruz1> did you have any code to show pls?
[12:12:08] <ruz1> just searching for inputs
[12:12:09] <ruz1> ..
[12:12:35] <tw2113> https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter
[12:13:27] <ruz1> thx!
[12:14:06] <tw2113> start browsing around their dev site for infos on how to do it all
[12:15:36] <ruz1> oh yeah checking thanks
[12:15:39] <ruz1> anyway
[12:15:42] <ruz1> i use this http://pastebin.com/qgbuU04h
[12:15:55] <ruz1> for facebook, i just would like to turn it into for twitter
[12:15:57] <ruz1> :P
[12:16:05] <ruz1> could be wonderfull man
[12:16:35] <tw2113> given that they're 2 different services, i can't offer any sort of guarantee that the code would be the same
[12:16:54] <ruz1> oh ok thx
[12:17:18] <djQuery> shouldnt this focus the input? $tip.val('').focus();
[12:17:51] <jillesme> djQuery: $('#tip).focus();
[12:17:59] <jillesme> djQuery: $('#tip').focus();*
[12:18:31] <djQuery> nopers $tip.focus().val('');
[12:18:54] <djQuery> jillesme, earlier in the code   $tip = $('#tip')
[12:19:08] <djQuery> want to cache the input so I dont have to keep finding it
[12:19:30] <jillesme> djQuery: then it would be $tip.focus() I guess
[12:20:07] <b1lly> djQuery:  .val() doesn't return "this" i believe
[12:20:19] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/awojuj/5/edit
[12:20:29] <djQuery> I ahve tried splitting them up as well
[12:21:50] <b1lly> it is focused
[12:22:05] <djQuery> then type and no input
[12:36:06] <b1lly> djQuery: it works ifne
[12:36:10] <b1lly> I think jsbin tool
[12:36:12] <b1lly> just messes it up
[12:38:08] <djQuery> take off the edit and it should do anything to it then
[12:43:22] <devslash> i have this html code http://pastebin.com/X6Uacz42 how do i loop through each subdiv where the class is listingRow ?
[12:44:06] <tw2113> $('.listingRow).each(i,function(){ //do stuff });
[12:44:17] <tw2113> something close to that
[12:44:26] <tw2113> double check params for the .each()
[12:49:12] <devslash> each doesn't work
[12:51:16] <shoky> devslash: $('#gwt-debug-applistingappList > .listingRow').each(function() { ... })
[12:52:09] <devslash> that doesn't do anything in firebug
[12:52:35] <devslash> i changed it to $('#gwt-debug-applistingappList .listingRow').each(function() { alert("yes"); })
[12:53:11] <devslash> is that correct ?
[12:56:13] <devslash> shoky: ?
[12:57:51] <shoky> devslash: it'll find any .listingRow thats anywhere inside #gwt-debug-applistingappList
[12:57:59] <shoky> if that's correct is up to you
[12:58:00] <devslash> its not doing anything
[12:58:09] <shoky> then you know what to do.

[12:58:14] <devslash> it should alert 6 times
[12:58:16] <devslash> i did

[12:58:38] <wathek> Hi everybody
[12:59:33] <wathek> I need some help I'm doing this : jQuery(this).next(".ui-accordion-content").find(".views-row-first .titleactumini.actuminibrief a:first")[0]
[12:59:41] <wathek> it returns a string of what I want
[12:59:44] <EvilDMP> Hi, I have created a little show/hide widget, that uses a select to determine whether another element is shown or hidden: http://jsfiddle.net/j2xYs/
[12:59:48] <wathek> but I cannot access the href attribute
[13:00:05] <EvilDMP> is it possible to amend th JS for this so that it works for an arbirary number of pairs of such elements?
[13:00:29] <EvilDMP> I have it working for one in the example, but of course the second one is not touched by my JS
[13:00:45] <EvilDMP> so it doesn't work
[13:01:34] <wathek> any idea how can I access the href attribute ?
[13:01:44] <ryanneufeld> ?attr @ wathek
[13:01:45] <bot-t> wathek, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:01:46] <wathek> I tried sith .attr('href') function but it returns undefined
[13:02:08] <wathek> however when I do console.log(jQuery(this).next(".ui-accordion-content").find(".views-row-first .titleactumini.actuminibrief a:first")[0])
[13:02:11] <ryanneufeld> wathek: then you're using it something that doesn't have an href
[13:02:12] <wathek> it returns the right a tag
[13:02:40] <wathek> ryanneufeld, it does have a href tag
[13:02:45] <wathek> s/tag/attribute

[13:08:16] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm working on a jQuery Mobile app, trying to catch "pagebeforeshow" to test whether the user is authenticated, and redirect them if not. It's working, but the page actually renders for a second before redirecting. Is there a way around this?
[13:08:24] <wathek> tw2113, you know it was really a stupid question
[13:08:57] <tw2113> meh
[13:08:58] <ryanneufeld> timwis: I don't think so. I've done a similar thing
[13:09:37] <ryanneufeld> timwis: do you have a demo?
[13:09:41] <tw2113> wathek, you had an issue you weren't managing to solve, you asked for help
[13:09:47] <timwis> ryanneufeld: Weird...I figured e.preventDefault() might do it or something...I mean isn't this kind of the point to having a pagebeforeshow event and not just pageshow?
[13:10:38] <ryanneufeld> timwis: have you considered pagebeforeload ?
[13:10:47] <ryanneufeld> timwis: "Triggered before any load request is made"
[13:10:58] <timwis> ryanneufeld: I'm not loading external pages though, just another <div data-role="page">
[13:11:20] <ryanneufeld> that shouldn't matter
[13:11:29] <ryanneufeld> cause you want to interrupt the loading of the page
[13:12:01] <ryanneufeld> timwis: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html
[13:12:37] <ryanneufeld> there is no deep linking to elements, but if you check the docs, they have a couple examples of how to use it. I think this is what you need
[13:12:41] <timwis> Hang on I'll throw a test case together
[13:16:08] <timwis> ryanneufeld: pagebeforeload doesn't get called at all
[13:16:39] <Cameron_> is there any way to only display a radius around the mouse of an image using jquery?
[13:16:40] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:16:42] <Cameron_> i have to layers of images
[13:16:43] <Cameron_> and i want a circle of the top layer to be displayed
[13:18:03] <timwis> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/TV4Tb/
[13:18:41] * ryanneufeld looks
[13:20:15] <ryanneufeld> oh, you need to bind on pageinit
[13:20:34] <ryanneufeld> to have the equivilent of doc ready
[13:22:16] <timwis> ryanneufeld: doesn't using .live make that unnecessary?
[13:22:46] <ryanneufeld> OH, wait
[13:22:51] <ryanneufeld> no you're doing this incorrectly
[13:23:25] <timwis> oh?
[13:23:58] <ryanneufeld> From my exp, these events are document level
[13:24:12] <ryanneufeld> so, rather than binding to a specific dom element
[13:24:17] <tw2113> wasn't live deprecated recently too
[13:24:18] <ryanneufeld> they're bound to the whole page
[13:24:34] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: yes, though now it's just an alias for on
[13:25:40] <timwis> ryanneufeld: Okay, so how should I be doing it?
[13:25:49] <ryanneufeld> timwis: I use pagehide
[13:26:04] <ryanneufeld> timwis: and I was mistaken
[13:26:11] <ryanneufeld> I have this in our code : $('div').live('pagehide', function(event, ui) {
[13:27:39] <timwis> you were mistaken about what?
[13:28:01] <ryanneufeld> events being document level
[13:31:47] <ryanneufeld> timwis: http://jsfiddle.net/TV4Tb/1/ I think I've only come up with another way to get you to the same place :S
[13:32:18] <timwis> heh, yeah, same result. thanks though
[13:33:01] <iman> i have a maybe strange question, I do some ajax process in html page such as adding html and remove some element, how can I clear page like it was at first, is it possible in jquery ?
[13:34:15] <ryanneufeld> timwis: can you not just bind to the click on that link?
[13:34:59] <timwis> ryanneufeld: Yeah, but what if they load to a particular url #hash
[13:35:01] <timwis> just seems sloppy
[13:35:04] <timwis> not how routing should work
[13:35:37] <ryanneufeld> timwis: why not just have the link point where you want it to?
[13:35:56] <timwis> it is pointing where i want it to - i just don't want them to be able to get there unless they're authenticated
[13:36:00] <ryanneufeld> I've typically done that sort of thing server side, though that doesn't seem to be an option for you
[13:36:07] <ryanneufeld> OH
[13:36:18] <ryanneufeld> then don't show them the link if they're not authed
[13:36:32] <ryanneufeld> change it to a login link
[13:36:51] <ryanneufeld> server side redirect might be a better option
[13:37:05] <ryanneufeld> if you're putting the html in the page already, then they'll be able to see it
[13:37:22] <ryanneufeld> unless I'm missing information. Either way, Sorry I couldn't have been more of a helo
[13:37:25] <ryanneufeld> *help

[13:46:44] <starsinmypockets> Weird - I'm trying to crawl a page that looks like it's rendered by Javaserver Pages (.jsp via get). I can see the whole dom in the inspector, but when I try to access the leements via jQuery they are all empty...
[13:46:47] <starsinmypockets> Anyone have any experience with this?
[13:51:36] <ryanneufeld> timwis: pagebeforechange is the event you want to use according to the jqm devs
[13:53:32] <timwis> In the same way? I swear I tried that one too
[14:23:45] <iman> how can i stop this interval? setInterval(function() {
[14:23:53] <iman> 			$.ajax({
[14:23:53] <iman> 				type : "GET",
[14:23:53] <iman> 				url : "/updateProductsPrices",

[14:23:53] <iman> 					success : function(result) {
[14:23:53] <iman> 						var products = result.split('|');
[14:23:53] <iman> 						for(var i=0;i<products.length;i++){
[14:23:54] <iman> 							var pValues = products[i].split('-');
[14:23:54] <iman> 							$('#'+pValues[0]+' td[name=showproducts-product-sell]').html(pValues[1]);
[14:23:58] <iman> 							$('#'+pValues[0]+' td[name=showproducts-product-buy]').html(pValues[2]);

[14:40:13] <Tomashe> all i wanted to do is , move all to right -900px , then take the first item put it on the end of the div.. and css right = 0 again and again...
[14:40:27] <Tomashe> im trying to create a basic images slider
[14:41:02] <Tomashe> few times right next to each other.. after 5sec it will slide them all to the right, take the first item, put it on the end and reset css and so on...

[15:54:00] <hateIE> can you do this ? $("#notifications").blur( function(){$(this).hide();} );
[15:57:35] <unblockgames> does the $.get function have to call a callback function or does the $.get return an xhr object?
[16:05:57] <chinoto> unblockgames: ajax function return deferred objects which you can use to add functions on success, failure, and a couple other things I don't recall
[16:07:14] <unblockgames> can you extract the response from the deffered object?
[16:08:22] <chinoto> the thing is, it takes time to get a response, so you would either have to make the browser freeze up until it gets a response, or provide it a function that gets executed on completion
[16:08:55] <chinoto> though I guess I didn't answer the question... sec
[16:10:58] <unblockgames_> when you use the $.post, how do you reference that information in your php function you called?
[16:11:14] <devslash> is this the correct syntax for .each ? $('.gwt-InlineLabel').each(function() { });
[16:11:20] <unblockgames_> is it passed as a parameter or requested from some variable
[16:11:21] <chinoto> $_POST['var']
[16:11:26] <unblockgames_> oh, ok
[16:12:16] <chinoto> or if you use direct input instead of url encoding, you use file_get_contents("php://stdin") (I believe)
[16:12:50] <unblockgames_> im having this same issue again and again
[16:12:59] <unblockgames_> i need to know the best way to get information from php to javascript
[16:13:02] <chinoto> devslash: aye
[16:13:27] <cusco> unblockgames_: I don't see how thatis a problem
[16:13:45] <unblockgames_> its a problem because im really new to programming and dont know wtf im doing
[16:13:51] <cusco> echo "<script>var aaa = $string;</script>">
[16:13:51] <unblockgames_> lol
[16:14:06] <cusco> ow, ok
[16:14:45] <unblockgames_> i never thought about echoing the script tag
[16:14:51] <unblockgames_> it was that simple
[16:14:53] <unblockgames_> wow
[16:15:22] <cusco> but probably that is not what you're afger
[16:15:33] <unblockgames_> well
[16:15:42] <unblockgames_> im making requests via jquery get
[16:15:57] <unblockgames_> but the issue is i cant figure out how to get the data without using a callback function
[16:16:28] <chinoto> unblockgames_: if I were to ignore the load function and use post, I could do this:
[16:16:28] <chinoto> $.post('http://example.com/',{a:1,b:"apple"},function(data) {$('#ph1').html(data);});
[16:17:45] <chinoto> unblockgames_: well you could avoid the callback function somehow, but as I've experienced from firefox plugin development, that freezes the browser until it gets a response or gives up
[16:20:13] <cusco> in php: $a = Array('one' => 1, 'two' => 2); json_encode($a); echo $a
[16:20:57] <cusco> in jquery ajax, sucess function(msg){ console.log(msg.one); }
[16:20:58] <cusco> or so
[16:21:06] <chinoto> I like using exit(json_encode($a))
[16:21:30] <chinoto> though that's because I generally have other code paths after it
[16:21:41] <cusco> I normally use some function then echo function(); die();
[16:44:34] <chinoto> documentation can really suck at times -_-
[16:46:05] <chinoto> unblockgames_: $.post() is shorthand for $.ajax; $.ajax() has an option for turning off async, the ajax functions return a jqXHR object that contains the response in the 'responseText' key
[16:47:05] <eip56> how do i work witht he results from a $.ajax() query... I know you pass a succes: function(data) but how can i query the results... All I get is object object.. Also is there a way to pass a specific id to grab like in the .load() function?
[16:48:29] <chinoto> eip56: maybe jquery is misinterpreting the type of the response and you have to specify it (text,html,script,json,etc)
[16:48:48] <eip56> i did type : 'html'
[16:49:14] <chinoto> hmm, can you do a codedump?
[16:49:27] <chinoto> I mean put it at pastebin.com or something
[16:50:57] <eip56> yea give me a few minutes.. the query works my question is how do i work with the contents... ie how can i query the results for a p with a class or id
[16:53:19] <chinoto> jquery should return html responses as a string, so if it's properly coded, you should be able to say $("p.myclass",response)
[16:55:10] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/hacadovoji.vhdl
[16:57:53] <chinoto> inside the success function, try "alert($('p.somename',response).html());" to see if it works
[17:02:11] <chinoto> eip56: as a test to see if my understanding was correct, I tried this in firefox's webconsole on a website with jquery
[17:02:11] <chinoto> $('b.m','<div>hello <b class="m">moto</b></div>').html()
[17:02:32] <chinoto> it returns "moto" as expected
[17:08:01] <coder7of9> i am using scrollable which includes its own navigation structur when you include objects with the specific classnames. i nbeed to know which one was clicked
[17:10:05] <coder7of9> i think i will have to devise a scheme - not in the api
[17:11:04] <chinoto> could you just use $(...).click(...)?
[17:11:11] <GoSox> I have a form submit even handler. when I return false, the form doesn't submit. But when I return myfunction( ), and myfunction( ) returns false, the form is still submitted. is there something else going on here, or is that just a think in javascript, that you can't return a function?
[17:12:56] <chinoto> coder7of9: you may need delegation: $(wrapper).on('click',selector,func)
[17:13:46] <chinoto> GoSox: that should definitely work, though are you returning the function itself or the result of the function?
[17:13:51] <chinoto> anyway, gotta go
[17:14:34] <coder7of9> thx
[17:14:39] <coder7of9> chinoto thx
[17:14:52] <GoSox> this is my code. If my function try_login( ) returns false, my form still submits:
[17:14:53] <GoSox> $("#form").submit(function() { return try_login(); });
[17:15:18] <GoSox> if i replace "return try_login()" with "return false", the form will not submit
[17:17:38] <GoSox> hmmm i think i see my problem. the returns in my function, are actually in a callback to $.post, so i assume they are returning from that, not from the actual parent function
[17:26:19] <clooth> and then it was.
[17:35:10] <devslash> i want to change the package name for one of my apps but before I do that i want to let existing users know about the change since Google treats the app as a new app when the package name changes. whats the best way to let my apps' users know about the change ?
[17:36:39] <devslash> oops
[17:36:43] <devslash> wrong channel sorry

[17:37:05] <coldhead> good luck devslash!
[17:37:15] <devslash> thanks
[17:37:26] <devslash> i still haven't figured out why .each doesn't work
[17:37:48] <devslash> coldhead: are you familiar with it ?
[17:38:19] <coldhead> quite
[17:38:26] <coldhead> wanna share the code that isn't working?
[17:39:19] <devslash> ok do i do $(.myelement).each(function() { some code here });
[17:39:43] <devslash> or .each($('.myelement'),function() {})
[17:40:51] <coldhead> the first version
[17:41:11] <devslash> when i type that into firebug it says .each doesn't exist
[17:42:25] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/AtVvR/
[17:42:42] <coldhead> it might not work in firebug because firebug sometimes steals $
[17:42:52] <coldhead> to use for firebugging purposes
[17:43:01] <coldhead> try jQuery('.whatever')
[17:43:07] <coldhead> firebug shouldn't steal that
[17:48:11] <coldhead> i gotta get some air, devslash, i hope that's working out for you
[17:48:22] <devslash> still fiddling with it in firebug
[17:48:23] <hdm> I am looking at some code that uses $$ as the prefix to the selector: $$(""input[type=checkbox]").each(...), any idea what is defining $$? Is this standard jQuery or some plugin/third-party lib?
[17:48:46] <hdm> MochKit uses it, but it pretty hard to google
[17:49:21] <GoSox> how can i get my function to return the values returned from the $.post call
[17:49:23] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/4j6pz/
[17:50:34] <boze> how come document.getElementById('text_box').value += something; works but $('text_box').value += something; doesn't? cant mix jquery and js?
[17:50:51] <GoSox> $('#text_box').
[17:51:07] <boze> err typo pretty sure I had that
[17:51:19] <hdm> answering my own - its created by Prototype and apparently does this: Selector.findChildElements(document, $A(arguments));, is there a jQuery equivalent to that?
[17:53:48] <coldhead> i'm not sure what $A(arguments) is doing but you can provide a root node to jQUery thusly: $('p', $('#someId'))
[17:55:34] <hdm> coldhead: thanks! looks like its scanning the entire dom
[17:55:43] <zwirc> Hi! Do anyone have a little time to spare helping me with a php / jquery issue? o.O
[17:57:32] <onimo> hi, I have some html like this : <textarea><img src="somepath" width="120" height="30" /></textarea>, how can I select and replace the numbers in width and height ?
[17:57:41] <coldhead> hdm: you could also do $('#someid p') but if you already have $node = $('#someid') it's useful there
[17:58:10] <coldhead> $('textarea img').attr('height', 300)
[17:58:24] <coldhead> oh woah
[17:58:27] <coldhead> inside a textarea
[17:58:35] <coldhead> this calls for a fiddle
[17:59:01] <zwirc> Got this issue where i moved /var/www from one server to another. Then suddenly i got this jquery error on a ajax file. But it is working on the other server, and all config is the same o.O. got 500 Internal error.
[17:59:08] <onimo> ahah yes that's the tricky part

[18:01:30] <zwirc> Hi! Do anyone have a little time to spare helping me with a php / jquery issue? o.O
[18:01:38] <coldhead> you could make that much nicer but you see the mechanics
[18:02:01] <coldhead> do you have a link zwirc ?
[18:02:11] <coldhead> that would be most helpful
[18:02:23] <onimo> thank you coldhead i see clear now
[18:02:38] <zwirc> coldhead: i pm you the file
[18:02:42] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life
[18:03:02] <coldhead> this is getting very involved zwirc
[18:03:19] <coldhead> i MAY repost anything you PM in here
[18:04:54] <zwirc> coldhead: thats np
[18:05:27] <zwirc> something wrong from if($_GET['upgrade'])
[18:05:34] <zwirc> the include file just has the mysql info.
[18:05:44] <zwirc> but the strange thing is that i got the same info on the old server
[18:05:50] <zwirc> and everything else is working
[18:06:00] <zwirc> so was thinking i maby missed a lib or anything
[18:06:09] <zwirc> the jquery is stored at /js/jquery local to
[18:07:13] <coldhead> 500 error means it really shouldn't involve jQuery
[18:07:23] <coldhead> is there anything interesting in the PHP error_log ?
[18:07:40] <zwirc> maby i miss curl?
[18:07:46] <zwirc> aint curl standard in php5.4?
[18:07:52] <zwirc> or do i need to install seperate?
[18:07:56] <coldhead> i have no idea, that's the kind of thing you'd ask in ##php
[18:08:00] <zwirc> sorry im just a starter in this game ^^
[18:08:15] <coldhead> sure thing, zwirc, you'll get there
[18:09:25] <GoSox> does an anonymous callback function have access to the local variables defined in it's parent function?
[18:09:44] <coldhead> zwirc: because you're using GET you should be able to recreate the actual URL+query string that AJAX is using, so you can visit it directly in your browser and not worry about the jQUery side of things
[18:09:57] <coldhead> someurl.com/aids?upgrade=knickers or whatever
[18:10:20] <coldhead> yes GoSox
[18:10:29] <coldhead> and the grandparents etc
[18:14:02] <coldhead> argh my spine
[18:14:48] <mansoor-s> coldhead, such is the life of a code monkey :(
[18:15:16] <coldhead> too true
[18:20:50] <GoSox> coldhead: i'm trying it with the variable $check_result and i'm getting undefined?
[18:20:51] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/YQbGE/
[18:21:45] <coldhead> it's not defined when you reach your switch()
[18:21:52] <coldhead> because the post() call hasn't completed yet
[18:22:03] <coldhead> AJAX happens asynchronously
[18:22:07] <coldhead> the rest of the code doesn't wait
[18:22:19] <tw2113> so THAT'S what the A stands for
[18:22:25] <coldhead> one of them!
[18:22:33] <tw2113> the other being arsehole?
[18:22:46] <coldhead> very possibly
[18:22:59] <coldhead> GoSox: you can fix it by moving the switch() into the post() callback
[18:23:07] <coldhead> because itll have a value inside there
[18:23:14] <vladikoff> ?ajax101 @ GoSox
[18:23:15] <bot-t> GoSox, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[18:23:34] <GoSox> coldhead: when i do that, it doesnt' work because the return values are kicking you out of the callback, not out of try_login()
[18:23:48] <GoSox> i need try_login() to return true or false, to stop or allow the login form to submit
[18:24:15] <coldhead> you probably want synchronous post() then
[18:24:26] <coldhead> which a lot of people will hate you for
[18:24:44] <GoSox> why would people hate me for that?
[18:27:37] <coldhead> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/YQbGE/1/
[18:27:48] <coldhead> people hate it because it locks up the browser
[18:27:50] <coldhead> until it completes
[18:28:03] <coldhead> but given the way your code is structured it's the simplest fix
[18:28:13] <GoSox> is there a better way to do this then?
[18:28:38] <GoSox> that is, form data verification that is done via an http request, separate from the actual form submission
[18:28:58] <coldhead> i would have a function that does the form submission
[18:29:18] <coldhead> and i'd pass that as a success handler to a function that asynchronously does the verification
[18:29:21] <coldhead> so like
[18:29:50] <coldhead> try_login(data_to_test, submit_form, show_error);
[18:30:04] <coldhead> and that runs either submit_form() or show_error()
[18:30:05] <RohanBhangui> hey guys what the esiest way to check if a div (with id foobar) is in a ajax reponseText
[18:30:10] <coldhead> depending on how it worked out
[18:30:22] <coldhead> and it can take as long as it needs without locking up the browser
[18:30:59] <coldhead> GoSox: to speak very broadly, it's better to pass around success and error functions that can be run as needed, rather than have code waiting for/relying on results from an asynch provcess
[18:31:32] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: if ($('#foobar', response_text).length > 0) { ... }
[18:31:42] <coldhead> no that won't work >: |
[18:31:49] <GoSox> but won't i ultimately end up with the same problem though? when you submit the form, i have to make an http request, and then wait for it before i can allow or disallow the submission?
[18:31:58] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: if ($(response_text).find('#foobar').length > 0) { ... }
[18:32:19] <RohanBhangui> if i wanted to do .find
[18:32:25] <RohanBhangui> hold let me show you quickly
[18:32:30] <coldhead> GoSox: in my imagination it works
[18:32:38] <GoSox> hah
[18:32:48] <GoSox> it always works until it doesnt
[18:32:49] <coldhead> there is a function that tests the credentials or whatever, via ajax
[18:32:55] <coldhead> and there is a function that submits the form
[18:33:02] <coldhead> and you pass the 2nd to the 1st
[18:33:07] <GoSox> but the test function is run ON form submission
[18:33:09] <coldhead> i suppose i will fiddle it for you
[18:33:16] <coldhead> yes, you'd undo that
[18:33:27] <RohanBhangui> coldhead: http://pastie.org/5633710
[18:33:27] <coldhead> you'd change the form submission to be like
[18:33:32] <GoSox> then when am i verifying the data, if not on form submission
[18:33:38] <RohanBhangui> i wanna use $(data)
[18:33:55] <coldhead> hold your titties, RohanBhangui, i'm going to sort out gosox's mindbrain first
[18:34:02] <RohanBhangui> sure
[18:34:11] <GoSox> hmmm actually there is a place i could put that in my code
[18:35:01] <rakl> hey, i'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but how would I bind an event to a form that has a bunch of checkboxes, that fired when any of the checkboxes is checked?
[18:36:46] <coldhead> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/xErEy/
[18:36:51] <coldhead> something very approximately like that
[18:37:22] <GoSox> coldhead: i think i got this, since i'm submitting the form via js anyway, i can just run try_login() instead and then instead of returning true or false, just call the .submit() or not call it
[18:37:40] <coldhead> good luck GoSox
[18:37:46] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: what's the problem here?
[18:38:00] <RohanBhangui> see http://pastie.org/5633710
[18:38:07] <RohanBhangui> see how i use a success function?
[18:38:09] <coldhead> if ($(data).find("#error").length > 0) alert('#error was present');
[18:38:15] <RohanBhangui> i wanna use $(data)
[18:38:23] <RohanBhangui> and search for #error
[18:38:31] <coldhead> you can do that
[18:38:32] <RohanBhangui> rather check whether it exits
[18:38:39] <coldhead> yes
[18:38:40] <RohanBhangui> *exists
[18:38:41] <coldhead> see above
[18:38:46] <coldhead> or below
[18:38:49] <coldhead> if ($(data).find("#error").length > 0) alert('#error was present');
[18:39:00] <RohanBhangui> kk thanks
[18:39:20] <coldhead> rakl: let me do you a demo
[18:40:04] <rakl> thanks coldhead . I'm playing around in console. But apart from saying something like form.children().someFilterFunction()
[18:40:15] <devslash> coldhead: i got it figured out thanks
[18:40:46] <coldhead> rakl: http://jsfiddle.net/FYku7/
[18:42:05] <rakl> oh very cool. I didn't know about $('form :checkbox)
[18:42:07] <rakl> thanks coldhead
[18:42:29] <GoSox> coldhead: doing it this way let me delete many lines too which is good :D
[18:42:43] <coldhead> rakl: this may also help http://jsfiddle.net/FYku7/1/
[18:42:59] <coldhead> AND you've made it simpler to work with in future, good work GoSox !
[18:43:19] <RohanBhangui> coldhead: which verison of jquery was .is() introduced?
[18:43:31] <coldhead> v 1.0, i am pretty sure
[18:43:48] <coldhead> yup
[18:43:52] <coldhead> i am awesome
[18:44:06] <rakl> coldhead is there a way to grab those checkboxes if you're selecting the form by it's id?
[18:44:31] <rakl> $('#source_form :checkbox') didn't work
[18:46:37] <Cronoh> #source_form input:checkbox prolly
[18:47:59] <rakl> Cronoh doesn't work either. Does it matter that the input elements are nested inside a <ul> <li> ?
[18:48:16] <rakl> not sure if that selector goes more than one level deep
[18:48:33] <coldhead> rakl: http://jsfiddle.net/FYku7/3/http://jsfiddle.net/FYku7/3/
[18:48:37] <coldhead> guh
[18:48:40] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/FYku7/3/
[18:48:46] <rakl> actually nope, I was selecting the wrong form
[18:48:56] <coldhead> that is setting the opacity of checked boxes to 0.5
[18:49:00] <rakl> $('#sources-form :checkbox') totally works
[18:53:52] <coldhead> great work everyone, i suppose i'll see myself out
[19:05:45] <gry> how do i define a function with jquery? i get some weird behaviour when trying to use the usual `function foobar(){}` syntax
[19:06:20] <coldhead> that shouldn't be an issue, gry
[19:06:23] <coldhead> jquery is just JS
[19:06:32] <coldhead> all the usual JS stuff is the same as ever
[19:11:31] <GoSox> coldhead: so that code you were helping me with, there's a reason it was so messed up
[19:11:55] <GoSox> like i said, my switch was in the callback first, but that didn't work because i couldn't double return out of two functions
[19:12:30] <GoSox> but beyond that, i had to rewrite that login form code 4 times to get a version of it that worked with web browsers' autofill password storing
[19:13:00] <GoSox> in it's first form, the login form was SUPER simple, all javascript. but the browser didn't know a form was being submitted
[19:28:01] <eip56> Hello, I am trying to use ajax to retrieve a certain paragraph from an html page. How can i query the response one the request was completed. It gives me the page but how do i work with the returned data. http://hastebin.com/rubuqonixi.vhdl
[19:30:22] <b1lly> eip56:     use the succes: function(data) { //use data }
[19:30:28] <shoky> eip56: function(response) {   var doc = $('<div>').append(response);  console.log( doc.find('p.classname').html() );    }
[19:30:32] <b1lly> oh you already are
[19:30:33] <b1lly> in the reponse
[19:30:56] <b1lly> the response is the data that was returned
[19:31:03] <b1lly> from the request
[19:31:14] <eip56> yea sorry i could of just called that var data
[19:31:17] <GoSox> do you have to declare javascript functions at the top of your document, before you call them? or can you put them anywhere like in php?
[19:31:29] <eip56> it returns the html page but everytime i try to query it nothing comes back
[19:31:33] <b1lly> you need to declare them before you can use them
[19:31:36] <shoky> GoSox: they don't need to be at the top
[19:31:40] <eip56> i either get object object or nothing on console.log
[19:31:49] <GoSox> hmmm conflicting answers
[19:32:00] <shoky> eip56:  is p.classname one of the root elements?
[19:32:08] <shoky> eip56: of the response data
[19:32:22] <eip56> its just a p tag with a classname on a html page
[19:32:37] <shoky> that's the whole response? just that <p> ?
[19:32:39] <eip56> im just learning ajax so i setup to basic black html pages
[19:32:50] <shoky> ok so do what i said
[19:32:55] <shoky> eip56: function(response) {   var doc = $('<div>').append(response);  console.log( doc.find('p.classname').html() );    }
[19:32:57] <eip56> and in console.log the ajax request comnpletes i guess im just uncertain how to get the data
[19:33:02] <eip56> k let me try
[19:33:14] <shoky> or if you just want to get at the root element, you can just  use $(response)
[19:33:27] <shoky> like.. console.log( $(response).html() )  to get the innerHTML of the <p>
[19:33:35] <eip56> comes back null
[19:33:38] <b1lly> GoSox, http://jsfiddle.net/qqLzt/
[19:34:11] <shoky> eip56: console.log(response) gives what?
[19:34:38] <GoSox> b1lly: so you don't need to declare them before using them?
[19:35:11] <b1lly> I thought you did, probably wrong then based on the test I wrote
[19:35:18] <GoSox> yeah
[19:35:20] <shoky> GoSox: they just need to be declared in the same scope, or an accessible scope
[19:35:27] <GoSox> ok
[19:35:30] <shoky> js functions are "hoisted" to the top of the current scope
[19:36:33] <eip56> Using firefox firebug as my console and it just gives me that a post request was completed. i used console.log($(response).find('p.classname')); and it gives me an object
[19:36:41] <shoky> eip56: console.log(response) gives what?
[19:37:00] <eip56> gives me the html
[19:37:07] <shoky> no,really
[19:37:14] <shoky> what do you want to log ?
[19:37:14] <b1lly> what do you mean by hoisted?
[19:37:27] <shoky> b1lly: "taken" to the top..
[19:37:30] <eip56> sry that gives me an object
[19:37:46] <eip56> im trying to get a specfic p.classname from that page
[19:37:48] <shoky> eip56:  console.log(response)  gives you an object?
[19:37:53] <eip56> yes
[19:37:58] <shoky> what object..
[19:38:32] <b1lly> shoky: how come this doesn't work then http://jsfiddle.net/
[19:38:39] <eip56> just the window object it looks like
[19:38:40] <shoky> b1lly wrong link
[19:38:53] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/JA4mh/
[19:38:58] <shoky> eip56: uhh.. pastebin your code again
[19:39:16] <shoky> b1lly:  because  the assignment =  is not hoisted
[19:39:37] <shoky> er
[19:39:43] <shoky> no thats not it
[19:39:54] <shoky> er yea thats it
[19:39:56] <shoky> ;]
[19:40:02] <b1lly> so it can't be an expression
[19:40:10] <shoky> variables and functions are hoisted, that's it
[19:40:15] <shoky> var x;  function f;
[19:40:24] <shoky> function f() { .. }
[19:40:31] <b1lly> var foo = function()  // is a *var8 ?
[19:40:35] <GoSox> is there a shortcut for selecting two IDs at once? like $("#id1","#id2").dosomethingcool()
[19:40:49] <b1lly> $('#id1, #id2')
[19:40:51] <shoky> b1lly:  var foo = X;   means:     var foo;  foo = X;
[19:40:51] <shoky> the 'var foo' is hoisted
[19:40:54] <shoky> the 'foo = X' is not
[19:41:01] <GoSox> b1lly: oh that works?
[19:41:07] <b1lly> try it
[19:41:08] <GoSox> i was just making that up as an example!
[19:41:20] <shoky> your example was wrong, he corrected it
[19:41:30] <GoSox> oh i see
[19:41:58] <b1lly> why would empty variables need to be hoisted?
[19:42:32] <b1lly> er why would they get hoisted without their value
[19:42:46] <b1lly> if a funciton and it's content gets hoisted, why shouldn't a variable and its content
[19:44:15] <shoky> functions are not seperable from their "content"
[19:44:18] <shoky> variables are
[19:44:23] <shoky> that's why they're called variables
[19:44:28] <shoky> they vary
[19:45:34] <eip56> ok shoky i get the returned html. how do i find the p tag in the returned data $(data).find('p') ?
[19:45:48] <shoky> eip56:  the p tag is the whole html , no?
[19:46:08] <b1lly> ah
[19:46:11] <b1lly> interesting
[19:46:13] <shoky> eip56: .find looks for descendants
[19:46:56] <eip56> ok soooo what would i use to find it.. as of now it returned opening to closing <html> and everything in between
[19:47:06] <eip56> trying to get the in between
[19:48:03] <shoky> when you console.log(response) it logs this?    "<html>.........</html>"
[19:48:14] <shoky> .find doesn't work ?
[19:48:38] <LV> .each() ?
[19:48:45] <shoky> no
[19:48:59] <eip56> no . find doesnt work and i get the complete html page
[19:49:16] <shoky> is that a yes to my first question?
[19:49:20] <shoky> it logs this?    "<html>.........</html>"
[19:49:31] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/fuvuqadofu.vhdl
[19:49:46] <shoky> dataType
[19:49:49] <shoky> not datatype
[19:49:58] <shoky> and.. answer my question already :\
[19:50:27] <tw2113> eip56, is shoky being difficult with you?
[19:50:52] <shoky> be totally honest
[19:51:07] <tw2113> you're being graded on this
[19:51:27] <eip56> no lol shoky has actually helped me quite a bit in the past
[19:51:30] <eip56> he knows his shit
[19:52:01] <eip56> ok changed dataType but now i just get an object returned
[19:52:07] <eip56> from the .find()
[19:52:07] <shoky> derp.
[19:52:15] <shoky> answer,my,question.
[19:52:17] <tw2113> just checking :)
[19:52:38] <eip56> shoky dam you dont start the derp shit lol
[19:52:55] <shoky> yarppp
[19:53:12] <tw2113> herpa derp
[19:53:13] <shoky> eip56: simple question tho..  console.log(data)   plz pastebin what it logs
[19:53:54] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/qosirukuqa.xml
[19:54:29] <shoky> really? it logs <?php  stuff?
[19:54:45] <eip56> yea apparently
[19:54:52] <shoky> heh..
[19:55:05] <shoky> here's a suggestion
[19:55:14] <shoky> your whole html file should contain only this:  <p>This is a test</p>
[19:55:17] <shoky> ?cc
[19:55:20] <eip56> lol im freaking the f out here i swear i did this aawhile back and i cant freaking figure out how to work with the dam return
[19:57:26] <coldhead> let's all try to stay calm and moist
[19:58:15] <GoSox> the dam return?
[19:58:28] <GoSox> you mean the flow regulator?
[19:58:57] <coldhead> there is a new one with a tapered shape for ease of insertion and removal
[19:58:57] <tw2113> the flux capacitor?
[19:59:18] <GoSox> did anyone here have O'Magles toys as a kid?
[20:00:13] <coldhead> you had a pretty fancy childhood GoSox
[20:00:18] <coldhead> in your solid gold mansion etc
[20:00:25] <GoSox> huh?
[20:00:34] <shoky> stupid jsfiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RdWTb/
[20:00:34] <coldhead> all i had was a bit of stick and an old breezeblock
[20:00:54] <GoSox> coldhead: o'magles are PVC pipes and fittings, painted kid friendly colors
[20:01:11] <GoSox> and they had clips to hold them together, instead of threading or glue
[20:01:17] <coldhead> i've seen them GoSox
[20:01:19] <coldhead> pretty fancy
[20:01:19] <GoSox> so you could build objects, and then climb on them
[20:01:26] <GoSox> i wouldn't call them fancy
[20:01:32] <GoSox> but fun, yes
[20:01:40] <coldhead> shoky: position your cursor between then ' and the < of '<script
[20:01:43] <coldhead> and type \
[20:02:12] <shoky> coldhead: ok?
[20:02:18] <coldhead> https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0156/3174/files/Captura_de_pantalla_2012-06-20_a_las_10.36.52_large.png?712
[20:02:29] <coldhead> shoky: you just see the \ inserted literally do you?
[20:02:32] <coldhead> oh well maybe it's just me
[20:02:36] <coldhead> CARRY ON
[20:02:38] <shoky> hmm yap
[20:03:01] <dankest> Does anyone know how to make a bootstrap modal undismissable?
[20:03:02] <coldhead> typing it there for me adds it after the = for some reason
[20:03:10] <coldhead> var html =\ '<...
[20:03:20] <coldhead> and =\ is how i feel about it
[20:03:22] <GoSox> coldhead: i wish i knew as a kid, that i could have my parents go to home depot and buy some generic pvc stock, so i could make gigantic structures instead of just normal ones
[20:03:25] <coldhead> so i guess they got that right
[20:03:49] <coldhead> GoSox: REMEMBER THIS FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN
[20:04:08] <coldhead> "oh don't worry kids, we're just going to home depot. nothing there for you. no like... castles or anything"
[20:04:38] <shoky> yea coldhead something similar happened to me earlier
[20:05:57] <chinoto> I want to help :D
[20:05:58] <coldhead> the JS formatting is less awful than it used to be at least
[20:06:00] <coldhead> SO FAR
[20:06:20] <coldhead> and the HTML autocompletion is cute
[20:06:23] <coldhead> <aids> etc
[20:06:23] <ashu> hi
[20:06:33] <chinoto> boo
[20:07:17] <ashu> i need help regarding drag,drop,rotate and resize an object on a map
[20:07:34] <chinoto> :|
[20:07:47] <shoky> its not cute when you've already written:   <a>bla</a>
[20:07:53] <shoky> and now want to wrap this with a <p>
[20:07:59] <shoky> so you go to the beginning and write <p>
[20:08:01] <coldhead> oh yes that really clamps
[20:08:20] <coldhead> ashu: you will have to be more specific :)
[20:08:21] <GoSox> i can't figure out what you guys are talking about
[20:08:24] <shoky> also </input> and </img> ;p
[20:08:30] <coldhead> the updated jsfiddle, GoSox
[20:08:36] <chinoto> wouldn't rotation of an element require some really fancy css or something?
[20:08:39] <coldhead> lol </img>
[20:08:59] <ashu> i am able to drag and drop an object
[20:09:03] <chinoto> GAH, IT'S <img/> BLAST YOU@
[20:09:12] <chinoto> :P
[20:09:20] <ashu> but not able to rotate and resize it on the map
[20:09:51] <coldhead> bloody gypsies
[20:10:20] <chinoto> resize shouldn't be too terrible, but I don't know how you would ever manage to even have a statically rotated an element
[20:10:57] <chinoto> unless it's some fancy css3 thing that only safari supports
[20:11:17] <coldhead> the css rotations aren't that hard and work everywhere except IE http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[20:11:30] <chinoto> oh O_o
[20:11:56] <coldhead> hey mattgifford
[20:11:57] <ashu> ican do them seperatly but i am unable to combine and do them at a time
[20:12:11] <chinoto> is that webgl?
[20:12:16] <graud> hi all, how might I remove the BMW ad on the left and right side of this page using jquery? http://devour.com/video/the-art-of-creative-coding/
[20:12:37] <coldhead> nope, just regular CSS
[20:12:38] <shoky> what BMW ad?
[20:12:41] <shoky> install adblock
[20:12:44] <graud> it seems the url is coming from another stylesheet
[20:12:46] <chinoto> find something unique about it and do $(...).remove()
[20:12:58] <graud> shoky: i do have it
[20:13:04] <ashu> its cool
[20:14:50] <shoky> graud: the ad is just a background image on <body>
[20:15:13] <ashu> i am trying to design an application that uses a map. where user can explain how an accident happened
[20:15:22] <shoky> graud: $('body').css('background', '#fff')
[20:15:33] <graud> thanks shoky, i'll give it a try
[20:15:47] <allain> Hey. What's the easiest way of making all direct children of all elements with a particular class the same size? Specifically foreach each parent of a particular kind, all of its immediate children have the same height?
[20:16:02] <b1lly> .children()
[20:16:05] <ashu> where user can rotate, rsize the object placed on the map
[20:16:21] <b1lly> ashu, googlemap api is pretty suave
[20:16:49] <ashu> i am trying to design an application that uses a map. where user can explain how an accident happenedmwhere user can rotate, rsize the object placed on the map.
[20:17:00] <ashu> i am using google api
[20:17:29] <chinoto> allain: or you could do $('.class>*'), which does the same as $('.class').children()
[20:17:34] <shoky> allain:  $('.someclass').children().height(200)
[20:18:41] <ashu> i am new to jquery can you explain little bit clear
[20:18:45] <ashu> thanks in advance
[20:21:20] <coldhead> ashu: you have chosen a difficult project for a beginner!
[20:22:22] <ashu> i have done bits and peices but i am unable to combine them
[20:26:54] <ashu> coldhead: can you give some clue
[20:27:48] <coldhead> sure: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6800613/rotating-image-marker-image-on-google-map-v3
[20:27:51] <eip56> ok shoky heres a better question. I want to accomplish the same thing as load. as in $('p').load('req.html p.classname'); that retrieves a specific p form the requesting page but i want to do it with $.ajax
[20:27:51] <chinoto> this was somewhat surprising: $('>li',$('ul')[0]).parent()
[20:27:53] <GoSox> i use this code to deal with hitting the return key in a form. It works well in most browsers, but in old Safari and in Opera, hitting return submits the form, even with the $event.preventDefault() command. any ideas why it won't stop?
[20:27:54] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/kx8Hu/2/
[20:28:40] <chinoto> before running .parent() I had 17 elements, I figured after running it I would have 17 copies of the same element, I am quite pleased :)
[20:29:06] <coldhead> good for you, chinoto!
[20:29:11] <shoky> eip56:  $('<div>').append(data).find('whatever')   is what .load does
[20:29:22] <chinoto> totally useless though :D
[20:29:33] <shoky> eip56: where 'whatever' in your example is 'p.classname'
[20:29:41] <coldhead> just like everything else :P
[20:30:52] <chinoto> I mean, it's useful that it happens, but my example to find out if that happens doesn't have any practical purpose... (over-clarification?)
[20:31:08] <b1lly> does jsquery UI position() work properly on absolutely positioned elements
[20:31:37] <chinoto> I would think that would be the whole point of it... test it out?
[20:34:09] <chinoto> b1lly: I happened to have a tab open I knew had an absolute positioned span, I tested it and it appears to work as expected
[20:35:49] <coldhead> that all depends on what you expected
[20:35:59] <chinoto> b1lly: $('#header_nav').position() //({top:0, left:684})
[20:37:59] <chinoto> it was an absolutely positioned div set to {top:0,right:0}, $(...).position() appeared to return the top-right corner as *I* expected.
[20:38:41] <coldhead> but relative to the window, or the parent, or the first relatively/absolutely positioned ancestor
[20:39:00] <coldhead> i'll never understand web stuffs
[20:39:03] <coldhead> so gomblex
[20:39:52] <GoSox> coldhead
[20:40:19] <coldhead> GoSox:
[20:40:30] <coldhead> AARGH MY SPINE
[20:40:37] <GoSox> why do you keep saying that?
[20:40:40] <chinoto> got a point there, it was relative to it's parent #header_cont, which is set to {position:relative}
[20:41:36] <chinoto> coldhead: set your client to autocomplete to last-spoke rather than alphabetical, much more convenient
[20:42:02] <coldhead> my client doesn't support anything like that
[20:42:06] <chinoto> :(
[20:42:08] <coldhead> it's from the 1970s
[20:42:23] <coldhead> much like myself
[20:42:51] <chinoto> I use xchat, I like it quite a bit (haven't really tried anything else though...)
[20:43:07] <coldhead> it's a popular option
[20:43:12] <coldhead> i have special needs
[20:43:26] <chinoto> ?
[20:43:44] <coldhead> we don't need to discuss them
[20:43:52] <chinoto> ...ok!
[20:44:12] <GoSox> coldhead: so any thoughts why the preventDefault() isn't stopping form submission on opera and old safari?
[20:44:13] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/kx8Hu/2/
[20:44:42] <GoSox> all other browsers woudln't submit the from even with out the preventdefault command, since there's no submit button
[20:44:57] <selina345> can somebody please tell me what's wrong with this code?
[20:45:02] <selina345> codecademy won't accept it
[20:45:03] <selina345> http://jsfiddle.net/wER8T/
[20:45:14] <coldhead> GoSox: i wouldn't expect that to work anywhere
[20:45:22] <chinoto> GoSox: the submit happens before the keyup
[20:45:28] <chinoto> GoSox: try keydown?
[20:45:33] <selina345> error message i receive is : Oops, try again.
[20:45:34] <selina345> It looks like your elevator didn't move down 100 pixels in 1 second! Did you add 100px to the top margin? (Check the Hint if you need help.)
[20:46:10] <coldhead> GoSox: i would use submit rather than keyup
[20:46:24] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect preventDefault on keyup to stop a submission
[20:47:09] <GoSox> but hitting return doesn't submit the form on most browsers. so if i did on submit, it wouldn't get triggered
[20:47:52] <selina345> pretty please
[20:48:04] <chinoto> GoSox: what's wrong with keydown?
[20:48:04] <GoSox> switching to keydown seems to have fixed it
[20:48:07] <coldhead> i would trigger a submit on enter, and let the submit handler handle the validation, GoSox
[20:48:09] <chinoto> nvm
[20:48:09] <GoSox> ^ nothing
[20:49:19] <GoSox> coldhead: we couldn't validate on submit because validating requires an http request, this is that same form from earlier. but it seems to be working normally with keydown
[20:50:21] <coldhead> selina345: http://jsfiddle.net/wER8T/1/
[20:50:26] <coldhead> top, not down
[20:50:45] <chinoto> GoSox: you could prevent it, do your request, if all is good use $(myform).submit()
[20:50:51] <coldhead> GoSox: yes, ignore me, chinoto is a better font of wisdom
[20:50:57] <chinoto> :O
[20:50:59] <GoSox> chinoto: yes that is what i do
[20:51:48] <chinoto> coldhead: how long have been coming to this channel? I just popped in today
[20:52:05] <selina345> coldhead: still no luck. thx anyway. it must be a bug.
[20:52:09] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[20:52:10] <selina345> internally
[20:52:20] <coldhead> probably not, selina345
[20:52:26] <coldhead> i also had to change you ' characters
[20:52:37] <coldhead> they were something weird in your link
[20:52:53] <coldhead> you might want to try copy/pasting one of these guys: '
[20:52:57] <coldhead> 'img'
[20:53:02] <chinoto> coldhead: oh, I figured you had been here longer since you've been responding to people a lot
[20:53:05] <selina345> coldhead: wait what did you change??
[20:53:21] <coldhead> selina345: i changed `img` to 'img'
[20:53:31] <coldhead> i just have a very dull day job, chinoto
[20:53:53] <selina345> ohhh
[20:55:40] <coldhead> is this you, selina345 ? https://twitter.com/ShradhaGaikwad
[20:55:59] <selina345> YES :|
[20:56:11] <coldhead> you should go to this: http://jqueryto.com/
[20:56:36] <selina345> anddd you am i talking to?
[20:56:39] <selina345> *who
[20:56:44] <coldhead> coldhead
[20:56:49] <selina345> bahahah
[20:56:50] <coldhead> and the rest of #jQuery
[20:57:05] <coldhead> http://twitter.com/coldhead
[20:57:23] <selina345> wait, how did you know who i was?
[20:57:42] <coldhead>  /whois selina345
[20:57:53] <coldhead> case closed
[20:58:00] <selina345> oh man, I'm such an irc noob
[20:58:33] <selina345> well i think I've gotten pretty good at query now
[20:58:33] <GoSox> who gives irc their real name?!
[20:58:38] <coldhead> hush, you're doing fine
[20:58:48] <selina345> i won't be attending any more conferences
[20:59:00] <selina345> unless I'm speaking at them
[20:59:01] <coldhead> aw that's very sad
[20:59:11] <selina345> its a waste of time + money
[20:59:15] <coldhead> if you were organising a conference you'd want people like you to go
[20:59:26] <vladikoff> GoSox, it's ok David https://twitter.com/gosox1
[20:59:27] <coldhead> can't you make your employers pay?!
[20:59:42] <selina345> no programming is not my day job
[20:59:54] <vladikoff> selina345, waste of time????
[20:59:58] <GoSox> vladikoff: why would you send me, a red sox fan, a link to some random white sox fan's twitter account??
[21:00:13] <vladikoff> GoSox, it's you david
[21:00:18] <coldhead> i'm sorry to waste your time selina345, best wishes for the rest of your life
[21:00:25] <selina345> -_-
[21:00:29] <GoSox> nope, it's not me, as my name is john
[21:00:33] <GoSox> and i'm from boston not chicago
[21:00:38] <coldhead> hey john
[21:00:42] <GoSox> hey
[21:00:44] * coldhead takes notes
[21:00:50] <selina345> i just mean, i could probably learn more by doing, rather than networking
[21:00:59] <GoSox> if you're talking notes, write down whatsmyip.org :)
[21:01:32] <coldhead> selina345: JS confs aren't about doing or networking, they're about getting nicely toasted with vladikoff
[21:01:36] <coldhead> he's in toronto
[21:01:39] <coldhead> i met him there for a conf
[21:01:43] <coldhead> AND I WILL NEVER REGRET IT
[21:01:58] <coldhead> when i say "toasted" i mean "eating poutine"
[21:02:05] <coldhead> that's not a euphemism
[21:02:08] <selina345> coldhead: rogl
[21:02:10] <selina345> rofl
[21:02:17] <coldhead> dude eats poutine, i've seen it
[21:02:33] <selina345> coldhead: we all do
[21:02:37] <selina345> this is canada
[21:02:45] <coldhead> best country on earth
[21:02:52] <selina345> indeeedddd :)
[21:02:57] <coldhead> the country that took french fries and made them better
[21:03:23] <systemfault> and more greasy
[21:03:25] <coldhead> poutine makes me believe a perpetual motion machine is possible
[21:03:25] <systemfault> Poutine++
[21:03:42] <selina345> oh man totally craving one now, great
[21:03:57] <selina345> lets stop the poutine talk ladies
[21:04:21] <coldhead> i honestly can't think of a non-poutine topic to discuss
[21:04:29] <coldhead> i am sure they must exist... but... what are they
[21:04:55] <selina345> query is like magicccc
[21:04:59] <selina345> jquery*
[21:05:29] <coldhead> poutine is like magicccc
[21:05:39] <selina345> -_________-
[21:05:50] <systemfault> Have you tried the "italian poutine" variant? :P
[21:05:56] <coldhead> actually vladikoff, i think the jqueryTO site needs more about poutine. can you sort that out?
[21:05:57] <systemfault> It's also good
[21:06:08] <coldhead> you're blowing my mind, systemfault
[21:06:08] <vladikoff> good point
[21:06:13] <coldhead> does this dish have a name?
[21:06:13] <GoSox> are $.post's inherently slower than $.get's or are they the same?
[21:06:28] <coldhead> they're close enough to be the same
[21:06:46] <systemfault> They're two different things...
[21:06:52] <selina345> so cold head, where are u based?
[21:07:23] <systemfault> I'm proud to live somewhere the Poutine Kingdom (The meal… not the russian idiot)
[21:07:28] <systemfault> *in the
[21:07:32] <coldhead> "Italian poutine differs from the standard recipe in that it uses meat spaghetti sauce in place of beef gravy. Don’t fool yourself, however; it’s still the culinary equivalent of smoking five packs of cigarettes in one sitting. Enjoy!"
[21:07:33] <coldhead> <333
[21:07:44] <systemfault> Haha
[21:07:48] <coldhead> i'm in australia, selina345
[21:07:58] <selina345> yuck, don't ruin it for the non-smokers!
[21:07:59] <coldhead> land of deserts and no poutine
[21:08:40] <coldhead> selina345: would you attend Poutine Conf Toronto?
[21:08:44] <selina345> coldhead: that's a shame.
[21:09:09] <selina345> selina345: no, probably not
[21:09:15] <coldhead> shame
[21:09:21] <zg> congrats on the update to the API, looks way better
[21:09:33] <coldhead> nice of you to say so, zg
[21:09:43] <selina345> another question: if it's a query conf, why is the site so poorly designed!?
[21:09:53] <coldhead> selina345: hahahahaha
[21:09:59] <zg> gnarf must be happy :)
[21:10:23] <selina345> i started learning aquery about a week ago, and i could probably do a better job
[21:11:52] <coldhead> selina345: you should email them to tell them that
[21:11:59] <coldhead> i mean, i'll copy paste your comments in an email
[21:12:04] <selina345> maybe i'll submit a talk
[21:12:07] <coldhead> but it's better coming from you
[21:12:13] <GoSox> the longer i stare are my main.js file, the more ways i come up with to do what it does with less code. if i keep looking at this thing, maybe i can think it out of existence
[21:13:26] <selina345> alright, I'm gonna change my name now. nice talking to you coldhead
[21:13:32] <systemfault> GoSox: As for your question about get/post…. get requests should be read-only
[21:13:36] <coldhead> happy trails, selina345
[21:13:39] <selina345> thanks for letting me know lol
[21:21:27] <Whirl3d> does anybody have a Date() library for JS that they are particularly fond of?
[21:22:29] <coldhead> moment.js
[21:22:39] <coldhead> http://momentjs.com/
[21:23:59] <Whirl3d> coldhead, thanks. That was one of the 5 so far that I have been looking at. I'll look into it more. Thanks
[21:25:49] <coldhead> moment.js is very popular
[21:26:25] <b1lly> lets say
[21:26:31] <b1lly> I have an array of objects
[21:26:46] <b1lly> is there an easy way to merge it with another array of objects
[21:27:11] <chinoto> $(...).add(...)
[21:27:38] <coldhead> i think he means [{}, {}, {}]
[21:27:45] <b1lly> ^
[21:27:46] <coldhead> rather than DOM elements
[21:27:59] <b1lly> like I have a settings object
[21:28:07] <b1lly> that holds an object with an array of objects
[21:28:20] <b1lly> and i basically want the user to be able to pass in that "list"
[21:28:44] <b1lly> so I have the defaults set, but I basically want to merge it with the "list" a user passes in
[21:29:05] <Whirl3d> $.extend()?
[21:29:08] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[21:29:14] <coldhead> Whirl3d++
[21:29:52] <b1lly> I didnt know if extend worked with arrays
[21:31:01] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat is the array way
[21:34:23] <b1lly> thers no way to have a list of objects, without it being an array, right?
[21:34:55] <coldhead> you can have an object of objects
[21:35:01] <coldhead> but they need keys
[21:35:09] <coldhead> unique keys
[21:38:36] <amagee> hey i'm looking for something like $.getScript, but I want to make sure the `success` callback is only executed after the specified script is downloaded *and executed*, not just after it's downloaded and maybe executed, as $.getScript does.  Is this possible?
[21:39:56] <coldhead> amagee: i would use getScript and poll for some variable created by the script you're waiting on
[21:40:11] <coldhead> i've never known the success to run before the script is evaled though
[21:40:25] <coldhead> you must be getScript()ing a monster
[21:40:39] <amagee> coldhead: it's the google api
[21:40:55] <amagee> although i guess i should be checking if they have a better way to do that themselves
[21:41:12] <coldhead> they likely let you register a handler to run once their stuff is loaded
[21:41:18] <coldhead> those googles think of everything
[21:41:35] <amagee> i don't like the way they do it though, it requires making a global name
[21:41:57] <coldhead> such is life :(
[21:42:41] <amagee> will look around and see if there's a better way

[21:47:32] <coldhead> and how
[21:48:12] <coldhead> i'm seeing terrible spine pain
[21:48:18] <coldhead> more than anything
[21:48:37] <GoSox> why?
[21:48:52] <chinoto> you need more language characters
[21:49:38] <chinoto> opensuse apparently came with them by default :)
[21:50:06] <GoSox> these here macintoshes come with an awful lot of fonts

[21:52:36] <GoSox> hmmmm its probably just my client
[21:56:46] <Boze> I have this: <input type="number" maxlength="4" size="4"/> does jquery mobile prevent it from working? i can keep typing numbers shouldn't it be limited to 4?
[21:57:52] <Haprog> 4 characters
[21:57:59] <Haprog> so it should be max 9999
[21:58:37] <Haprog> dunno about jQuery mobile though
[21:59:00] <Haprog> but normally on input type text atleast
[22:00:03] <Haprog> HTML5 input number element seems to have min and max attributes though if that's what you want
[22:00:48] <Haprog> I don't know how well it's supported though
[22:01:11] <Boze> just trying to prevent a 5th character from being entered. hmmm
[22:01:37] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8354975/how-to-add-maxlength-for-html5-input-type-number-element
[22:02:01] <coldhead> "Although the user may be able to type a number greater than the allowed max, the form will not submit."
[22:02:32] <Haprog> Boze: I don't think number input supports maxlength attribute. try max="9999"
[22:03:29] <Boze> coldhead, ahh thanks <3
[22:03:55] <jfr> hai
[22:03:59] <Haprog> yeah and min="1" or min="0" obviously if you don't want negative numbers
[22:03:59] <jfr> ;ksdf
[22:08:35] <Boze> coldhead, yep thats what it was doing
[22:08:47] <Boze> thanks Haprog you were spot on too <3
[22:09:27] <GoSox> I'm going to start a movement to try to get web browser makers to clean up the user agent strings, and make them all standard and not-abusrd
[22:18:13] <marinade> hey guys the jquery on this is not working its supposed to have a line following the active link http://codepen.io/anon/pen/olLbt
[22:18:24] <marinade> as displayed here http://css-tricks.com/jquery-magicline-navigation/
[22:19:38] <chinoto> GoSox: good luck
[22:19:52] <chinoto> oh wow, 10 minutes after
[22:20:34] <coldhead> marinade: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[22:20:41] <coldhead> looks like jquery isn't loaded
[22:20:49] <marinade> derp
[22:21:32] <marinade> but coldhead how can jquery not be loaded in the codepen ?
[22:22:45] <systemfault> GoSox: If you care about agent strings, you're doing something wrong :P
[22:22:58] <systemfault> The only exception being detecting mobile platforms :/
[22:23:32] <GoSox> then you'll like my model for an ideal user agent string, it explicitly states the platform: pc, mobile, tablet, tv, bot
[22:23:52] <rawtext> does anyone know the name of this new text scrolling css/js plugin? the plugin site has a dark blue background, and when you scroll down the page text will animated any which way into position only when scrolling down or up, their text is yellow on dark blue. It was fascinating but I can't find it or anything like it.
[22:24:35] <chinoto> GoSox: I think systemfault has a point, you should be feature testing and checking the screen size, not checking for specific browsers
[22:25:07] <chinoto> I mean resolution, dunno if actual size would be available
[22:25:43] <GoSox> with retina displays abound, resolution doesn't tell you as much as a simple useful user agent string can
[22:25:51] <GoSox> btw this is a standard IE user agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
[22:26:44] <Cork> GoSox: large parts of that depends on whats installed on the system
[22:26:57] <GoSox> and its all completely useless
[22:27:08] <GoSox> that browsers user agent could be: Windows/XPSP2; MSIE/8.0; Platform/PC;
[22:27:26] <Cork> ya, but that would break the web
[22:27:33] <Cork> cause of the heavy use of ua sniffing
[22:27:55] <GoSox> look at chrome's user agent, i think that part of the web is already broken
[22:28:16] <GoSox> hey i'm chrome, and safari, and mozilla!
[22:28:21] <Cork> heck mozilla had to postpone changing its ya string date to a version number for almost 5 years cause if broke to much
[22:28:32] <Cork> ya==ua
[22:28:35] <chinoto> maybe we should have a few big changes, turn a pile of rubbish into something useful, then the devs can go ahead and use the new way or be forgotten
[22:28:47] <GoSox> chinoto++
[22:28:54] <coldhead> i don't know anything about codepen, marinade
[22:29:00] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[22:29:01] <GoSox> there no point in having a user agent if it's going to be a disaster like this
[22:29:10] <chinoto> exactly
[22:29:27] <systemfault> coldhead: I can't wait for your second day of jQuery usage… days are long where you live
[22:29:28] <tw2113> UA sniffing is so early 2000s
[22:29:34] <chinoto> on the other hand, why do we need it?
[22:29:35] <GoSox> maybe an implementation solution could be a separate http header
[22:29:38] <tw2113> feature sniffing is where it's at
[22:29:43] <chinoto> aye
[22:29:46] <Cork> tw2113: its actually mid 90's
[22:29:57] <marinade> well coldhead i dont seem to be getting that error on the website itself www.chai-kabob.com
[22:29:59] <GoSox> for one thing, we need it for accurate stats
[22:30:12] <coldhead> my UA string is set to "", i value my privacy
[22:30:43] <GoSox> for another thing, i know this is a javascript channel but, feature sniffing won't tell you what css properties are properly supported and which are not
[22:30:48] <Cork> GoSox: many push for it to be much more restrictive in what it contains, with the most extream beeing "browser"
[22:30:55] <systemfault> I set my UA to coldheadISsexy
[22:31:01] <chinoto> better to check for a feature and fix it everywhere it is unimplemented/broken than to fix it for ones you know of
[22:31:04] <tw2113> no way, me too systemfault
[22:31:16] <hdm> this is driving me crazy - anyone know whether the JS spec allows ' to be escaped in a double-quoted string? It works fine in my browser, but datatables/jslint.com complain about this: { "this is": "\'valid json, but datatables & jslint.com break" }
[22:31:17] <systemfault> Welcome to the club
[22:31:30] <hdm> unfortunately this is the default behavior of rails3's escape_javascript()
[22:31:52] <coldhead> marinade: i don't see that error on that site either
[22:31:57] <chinoto> hdm: I think it may be that jslint isn't perfect
[22:31:58] <coldhead> but i also don't see jQUery loaded at all
[22:32:06] <Cork> hdm: jslint is over strict
[22:32:13] <chinoto> that too -_-
[22:32:16] <hdm> chinoto: unfortunately whatever datatables uses to validate is also strict
[22:32:18] <Cork> and often complain about things that has no problem
[22:32:20] <trinadh> marinade: in codepen, in the settings window, check if you have selected jquery to be loaded
[22:32:25] <chinoto> oh :|
[22:32:26] <marinade> hmm i think its something to do with the chidl theme hold up lemme fix that
[22:32:28] <hdm> the bug is either in datatables, rails, or jslint
[22:32:34] <coldhead> godess bless you, trinadh
[22:32:49] <Cork> hdm: the bug is in the validator, its completely valid
[22:32:57] <chinoto> can you use &#39;?
[22:33:09] <Cork> uh no wait a min
[22:33:09] <hdm> Cork: fun, thanks, well, crap heh
[22:33:16] <marinade> lol trinadh i added the jquery library adn got a third error on top of the two errors !!
[22:33:24] <marinade> in codepen
[22:33:26] <Cork> hdm: you don't need to escape it, and thats prob why it complains
[22:33:54] <Cork> hdm: sorry first day back from my vacation, so i bit rusty :)
[22:34:05] <hdm> rails3 outputs it with the escape, but the datatables/jslint stuff complain, its hackable by just removing the \', but tryign to figure out how to file a bug on
[22:34:18] <hdm> er, who to file a bug with
[22:34:36] <Cork> hdm: ya, escape don't know what kind of string it will be put in so it has to escape both
[22:35:03] <hdm> heh, so blame jslint/datatable's validator?
[22:35:07] <Cork> hdm: its a bug in rails, but its prob something thats tricky to fix
[22:35:19] <trinadh> marinade: lol
[22:35:29] <Cork> hdm: it should be { "this is": "'valid json, but datatables & jslint.com break" }
[22:35:33] <trinadh> marinade: the error is..
[22:35:49] <Cork> hdm: but the escaper doesn't know if it will be put in "" or '' so it escapes all strings
[22:35:51] <coldhead> marinade: $(".current-menu-item a").position() -- you don't seem to have this element
[22:36:34] <trinadh> coldhead: thank you :)
[22:36:36] <hdm> Cork: makes sense, so a desing bug w/the rails method
[22:36:41] <hdm> for now - 	def escape_javascript_less_poorly(str); escape_javascript(str).gsub("\\\'", "'"); end
[22:37:07] <Cork> hdm: well its a complexity bug with the rails escape ya
[22:38:22] <hdm> thanks!
[22:38:30] <marinade> coldhead i just fixed that
[22:38:35] <marinade> it was supposed to read current_page_item
[22:38:39] <Cork> hdm: btw .gsub("\\\'", "'") is invalid
[22:38:46] <marinade> but still no worky
[22:38:47] <Cork> .gsub("\\'", "'") is what you want
[22:39:10] <Cork> or .gsub('\\\'', '\'') is what you want
[22:39:10] <marinade> and i added the scripts now on my website it sould be loading no? www.chai-kabob.com
[22:39:55] <coldhead> i still don't see jQuery loaded there
[22:40:01] <chinoto> not sure if it was php or javascript, one of them only escapes when escaping would actually do something
[22:40:26] <marinade> yea my bad now it should be there, i added it to ie 9 by accident
[22:40:29] <Cork> chinoto: both does
[22:40:31] <chinoto> or it's because I was testing stuff from a terminal
[22:40:36] <eedfwchris> How can I remove the first "key" value of a name attribute? ex: foo[0][something] become foo[][something]
[22:40:38] <chinoto> Cork: oh
[22:40:45] <eedfwchris> I tried $clone.find('input').attr('name').replace("#^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$#", "$1[]$3");
[22:40:46] <Cork> chinoto: but they both actually accept it
[22:40:55] <Cork> chinoto: same with rails
[22:41:01] <marinade> oops 404 not found
[22:41:10] <Cork> its just the js escape function that doens't have the context
[22:41:11] <marinade> its loooking for them in the parent theme hold up
[22:41:11] <eedfwchris> oh shit i think i just need to escape me []
[22:41:36] <eedfwchris> no damn.
[22:41:57] <chinoto> Cork: I'm testing in firefox webconsole, "\a" returns "a"
[22:42:09] <coldhead> ARGH MY SPINE
[22:42:20] <eedfwchris> MY SPLEEN
[22:42:22] <Cork> chinoto: ya, thats how c works, and everything thats based on its string handling
[22:42:29] <marinade> ok now its loading coldhead
[22:42:33] <marinade> but im getting this error Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined example.js:2 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[22:42:47] <coldhead> in what sense is it loading then >: |
[22:42:48] <chinoto> Cork: ok... but you just... derp?
[22:43:23] <coldhead> no marinade, i see a bunch of scripts being loaded
[22:43:26] <coldhead> none of them are jquery.js
[22:43:43] <Cork> chinoto: the function we talk about escapes the string for it to be sent over the net, you checked the escape or internal representation
[22:43:47] <coldhead> it's just a veil of tears
[22:43:52] <coldhead> vale*
[22:44:04] <Cork> eedfwchris: "#^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$#" isn't a regular expression
[22:44:16] <Cork> /#^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$#/ is

[22:44:24] * Cork hits b-ot
[22:44:28] <marinade> doh coldhead
[22:44:34] <marinade> is it ok to reference this http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
[22:44:35] <hdm> Cork: oh, its worse, check this out: { "bleh": "	<div class=lightbox-content>" }
[22:44:48] <marinade> or is that too new
[22:44:49] <hdm> Cork: that breaks the validator as well
[22:44:53] <Cork> ya
[22:45:04] <coldhead> it's fine with me, marinade
[22:45:05] <eedfwchris> Cork: uh?
[22:45:38] <Cork> eedfwchris: .replace("#^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$#", "$1[]$3"); will look for the actual string "#^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$#"
[22:45:49] <Cork> not the regular expression you have in that string
[22:46:04] <eedfwchris> my understanding is # will act as the /

[22:48:12] <coldhead> that item is still not present
[22:48:19] <coldhead> so you're doing undefined.left

[22:49:26] <coldhead> you deleted too much, marinade
[22:49:29] <marinade> for some reason i didn't need that sounds like awkward english or amybe im jsut tired
[22:49:32] <coldhead> now it says "unexpected end of input"
[22:49:47] <coldhead> probaly you are missing some closing })s
[22:50:11] <marinade> yea lool just added it back in
[22:50:27] <marinade> haallelehja no more errors
[22:50:32] <eedfwchris> Cork: hrmm in addition to that it seems when I "quote" the expression it doesn't work as expected
[22:50:33] <marinade> but still it doesnt work !!!
[22:50:42] <eedfwchris> so "/foo/" != /foo/
[22:50:47] <Cork> ya
[22:50:51] <eedfwchris> learn something every day
[22:50:56] <Cork> // is javascript expression
[22:51:08] <eedfwchris> got it!
[22:51:13] <eedfwchris> thanks for your help.
[22:51:15] <marinade> any idea coldhead?
[22:51:19] <Cork> or new RegExp("^(.+)(\[\w+\])(\[.+)$")
[22:52:33] <marinade> could it be becasue i am trying to append a class into an id? $(".main-navigation").append("<li id='magic-line'></li>");
[22:52:55] <marinade> no idea if that made sense or if it is even correct because i am still to learn about jquery
[22:53:09] <coldhead> no that's fine marinade
[22:53:12] <coldhead> the element is there
[22:53:15] <coldhead> and it's moving around
[22:53:18] <coldhead> you just can't see it
[22:53:21] <coldhead> it has no height
[22:53:23] <coldhead> and width: 0;
[22:53:29] <coldhead> you just need to style it with some CSS
[22:54:05] <marinade> coldhead it had a height of 2px and i jsut made it 20px
[22:54:09] <marinade> still not visible
[22:54:13] <coldhead> $('#magic-line').css({border: "1px solid #0f0"})
[22:54:17] <coldhead> that works for me
[22:54:18] <marinade> #magic-line { position: absolute; bottom: -2px; left: 0; width: 100px; height: 20px; background: #fe4902; } }
[22:54:21] <eedfwchris> Cork: next issue is .replace() doesn't seem to work with arrays. any idea how to do it with .each() ?
[22:54:27] <eedfwchris> without*
[22:54:49] <Cork> ?mdc array
[22:54:50] <bot-t> Cork, Array - JavaScript | MDN - The JavaScript Array global object is a constructor for arrays, which are high-level, list-like objects. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[22:55:06] <marinade> that's odd
[22:55:15] <eedfwchris> collections?
[22:55:21] <eedfwchris> sorry I don't know hte proper term
[22:55:41] <Cork> eedfwchris: as far as i know there isn't a cross browser way to update an array while you're looping it
[22:55:53] <Cork> or that might be objects
[22:56:17] <eedfwchris> ya sorry, best to provide an example. $('input').attr('name').replace('foo','');
[22:56:28] <coldhead> if your loop uses thing.length then you can add to it as you iterate
[22:56:31] <Cork> name isn't an array
[22:56:50] <eedfwchris> ah okay… so i have to dump it into .each ?
[22:57:02] <eedfwchris> (just making sure there wasn't a snazzy way to do it I didn't know about).
[22:57:08] <Cork> eedfwchris: for name? no
[22:57:14] * tw2113 ignores some jquery issues going on in IE8
[22:57:24] <tw2113> i'll deal with them if the client ever complains
[22:57:25] <Cork> ah you mean you have multiple inputs?
[22:57:30] <Cork> ?.attr
[22:57:30] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:57:32] <eedfwchris> Cork: right
[22:57:35] <Cork> the first element <--
[22:57:43] <Cork> so yes you need each
[22:57:48] <eedfwchris> alrighty :)
[22:57:57] <Cork> and you need to store the modification
[22:58:02] <Cork> replace doesn't change the original string
[22:58:11] <Cork> it returns the generated string
[22:59:06] <marinade> coldhead are you saying i should add $('#magic-line').css({border: "1px solid #0f0"}) somewhere?
[22:59:29] <marinade> im guessing no..
[22:59:58] <coldhead> marinade: when i run that from the console
[23:00:05] <coldhead> it adds a fetching green border
[23:00:13] <coldhead> and i can then watch the line move around
[23:00:43] <coldhead> what i'd do is use the power of mental thought to solve problems
[23:00:46] <marinade> oo yea i see it
[23:00:56] <marinade> but its in the middle and no where near the nav bar
[23:00:59] <marinade> lol
[23:01:09] <yogurt_truck> what a boring magic line
[23:01:15] <marinade> lol
[23:01:17] <coldhead> marinade: these problems, like most problems, can be solved with CSS
[23:01:28] <coldhead> and a small bottle of massage oil
[23:01:43] <coldhead> i prefer unscented
[23:01:47] <coldhead> i have allergies
[23:01:52] <marinade> yea i feel u coldhead im trying to find it becasue in my stylesheet i have #magic-line { position: absolute; bottom: -2px; left: 0; width: 100px; height: 20px; background: #fe4902; }
[23:01:58] <marinade> but i guess something might be blocking it
[23:02:06] <marinade> thank you for all your help so far tho
[23:02:15] <coldhead> marinade: if you right click on the line and choose "inspect element"
[23:02:20] <coldhead> you can see the actual applied CSS
[23:02:28] <coldhead> and experiment with it in the browser to suit your needs
[23:02:46] <chinoto> especially if you use the computed view (for things like height)
[23:02:56] <chinoto> or font-size
[23:04:40] <marinade> yea thanks so much coldhead
[23:04:49] <marinade> i might have to slep on it
[23:04:51] <marinade> its 2 am
[23:04:54] <marinade> :)
[23:05:19] <coldhead> you'll solve it in your sleep
[23:05:25] <coldhead> in the web debugger of your dreams
[23:05:37] <coldhead> shoot me first, before i shoot you
[23:06:20] <marinade> hahaah
[23:06:32] <marinade> i want to solve it soo bad befor ei sleep
[23:06:40] <eedfwchris> I'm curious. When you guys have a form with a "name array" … like provider[1][foo] … how do you guys typically deal with inserting a "new" provider?
[23:06:44] <marinade> but im newb and itll take me a good hour i bet
[23:07:08] <eedfwchris> I was clearing out the [1] but there's nothing that correlates provider[][foo] and provider[][bar]
[23:07:24] <Cork> eedfwchris: have a formating string for the name
[23:07:29] <Cork> and then add a count
[23:07:31] <fotoflo> hey all. I'm doing a $.ajax request to get a static JSON file on my server cdn.my.tld the request is coming from a page hosted at my.tld  will this have a cross-domain problem?
[23:07:44] <eedfwchris> Cork: so like new_1 or something?
[23:07:47] <coldhead> yes it will, fotoflo
[23:07:52] <Cork> fotoflo: yes
[23:07:59] <fotoflo> I'm getting an error but textStatus and errorThrown are coming back empty
[23:08:00] <fotoflo> ok
[23:08:04] <fotoflo> thankx
[23:08:12] <coldhead> good luck marinade
[23:08:27] <Cork> eedfwchris: 'provider[' + count + '][' + name + ']'
[23:08:37] <marinade> thanks dude gnite
[23:08:56] <eedfwchris> Cork: the problem is provider[1] correlates to a db primary key ( the 1 that is )
[23:09:20] <Cork> eedfwchris: ya, so send the key from from the backend
[23:09:39] <Cork> and have new or something to replace it if its not in the database
[23:09:46] <coldhead> eedfwchris: i'd avoid sending primary keys to the browser
[23:10:18] <Cork> coldhead: its how restless works
[23:10:52] <eedfwchris> hrm
[23:11:48] <coldhead> restless waters
[23:11:52] <coldhead> hithering and thithering
[23:11:53] <Cork> eedfwchris: alternatively you could split it up so you send each row separately back and then you don't need the extra array
[23:12:18] <Cork> (that would depend on js though)
[23:13:13] <coldhead> SNOWWWWWFLAAAAAKE
[23:13:27] <eedfwchris> like js would find all the providers[] "groups" and save them in separate requests?
[23:13:59] <Cork> no ex. you set the id on the tr and then just have the field names on columns
[23:14:16] <Cork> and then you pick the different values use the id in the path and send a single post when you add
[23:14:33] <Cork> this is just a generic example as i don't know what you're doing
[23:16:50] <eedfwchris> seems like all the options suck a little :P
[23:18:31] <eedfwchris> seems like I should have providers[1][1][name] providers[2][][name]
[23:18:46] <eedfwchris> which i think is what you are eluding to
[23:18:57] <eedfwchris> 1 and 2 are arbitrary
[23:19:08] <Cork> uh, no
[23:19:56] <eedfwchris> this is what i'm building for what it's worth… http://screencast.com/t/RzcFTNi1
[23:24:58] <eedfwchris> actually i'm dumb
[23:25:37] <coldhead> aw don't be like that
[23:26:04] <eedfwchris> this could be easily solved by putting the "provider_id" in the array key
[23:26:24] <eedfwchris> maybe that's what you were aluding to?
[23:26:55] <eedfwchris> providers[1][provider_id] = 1 … and [1] is arbitrary
[23:33:11] <mahdi_ja> hi all.
[23:33:39] <mahdi_ja> how i cant select all span with inner text "hello" with jquery
[23:34:02] <motka> mahdi_ja "how YOU cant"?
[23:34:03] <Cork> mahdi_ja: you can, but its doomed to be a very slow selector
[23:34:23] <Cork> cause dom has to way to make that kind of selection effectively
[23:34:44] <Cork> you would have to find all spans, then check its content and see if its the string "hello"
[23:34:49] <Cork> :contains does this
[23:34:56] <Cork> but you should REALLY use a class instead
[23:35:33] <mahdi_ja> Cork, how i can check content of span
[23:35:40] <Cork> i just told you
[23:35:46] <Cork> ?:contains
[23:35:47] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[23:36:04] <mahdi_ja> Cork, thank you
[23:36:11] <mahdi_ja> bot-t, thank you
[23:36:12] <bot-t> mahdi_ja, I'm a bot you know..
[23:36:45] <Cork> and thats the same as $('span').filter(function(elm) { elm.innterHTML === 'hello'; });
[23:36:58] <Cork> * $('span').filter(function(elm) { elm.innerHTML === 'hello'; });
[23:37:11] <Cork> uh... for got return ;)
[23:39:05] <GoSox> is there a way to select input elements by their name, instead of an id?
[23:39:34] <Cork> $('input[name=""]')
[23:39:41] <GoSox> ahh
[23:41:09] <_sCoRpi> GoSox: if you filter by name and you have many inputs, jquery will have to loop through all input fields checking their name. if you have a container around your input fields, you might want to check if selecting the container by id first and then using find() with your desired selector is faster
[23:41:34] <GoSox> when you say "many inputs"
[23:41:40] <GoSox> how man is "a lot"
[23:41:56] <Cork> say 20+
[23:42:11] <Cork> depends on how often you run the selector
[23:42:50] <Cork> AND it depends on how big you're dom is
[23:42:58] <_sCoRpi> ^what he said
[23:43:16] <Cork> GoSox: so basically, make it simple if you feel it lags, optimize
[23:43:28] <GoSox> my gf says my dong is huge
[23:43:31] <GoSox> oh DOM . . .
[23:43:37] <Cork> -_-'
[23:43:46] <chinoto> unless it can't be used or wouldn't be helpful, I always use this form $(selector,context)
[23:44:02] <Cork> ugg i hate that syntax
[23:44:43] <chinoto> $(context).find(selector) works to, although longer :/
[23:45:03] <Cork> ya, and its much more intuitive what it does
[23:46:08] <chinoto> meh, if you know what it does, you know what it does
[23:47:12] <Cork> chinoto: it doesn't matter so much if i know what it does, but if someone that wasn't involved in writing the page comes and need to work with it 2 years down the road it should be as easy to understand as possible
[23:48:16] <chinoto> Windows Vista/7 don't say "Start" next to the start menu icon, what about the people who are new to using Windows or computers in general (think of kids for example)?
[23:49:18] <chinoto> answer: they'll figure it out or ask someone for guidance.
[23:49:20] <Cork> chinoto: its a bit different, when you work with a system you need to learn how it works
[23:49:33] <Cork> when you write code you want it to be as readable as possible
[23:49:52] <Cork> cause the more readable you make it the faster someone can grasp how it sticks together
[23:50:21] <Cork> you rarely need to know what makes the start menu open when you click the start flag button
[23:50:23] <chinoto> Cork: if they don't know this, then should either start learning or be replaced
[23:50:44] <Cork> chinoto: like i said its not about knowing
[23:50:52] <Cork> its readability
[23:51:06] <Cork> its much easier to miss a comma in a selector then a .find
[23:51:45] <Cork> ex. $('input, select, .classes p', '.selector)
[23:51:51] <Cork> * $('input, select, .classes p', '.selector')
[23:52:04] <Cork> compared to  $('.selector').find('input, select, .classes p')
[23:52:36] <Cork> put a bunch of lines around that and the ',' is easy to miss
[23:52:55] <Cork> and $('input, select, .classes p', '.selector') becomes $('input, select, .classes p, .selector')
[23:52:57] <chinoto> Cork: well I guess the reason I prefer it is because I'm used to writing $(':input',wrapper), where you don't have a comma at the end of the function arguments
[23:53:28] <Cork> that only works in you never have to use complex selectors
[23:55:30] <chinoto> Cork: the other thing is, my editor has syntax highlighting, so the first argument (string) is grey, while the second (variable) is black
[23:56:49] <Cork> depending on a specific highlighting solution for the code to be readable doesn't sound like an optimal solution to me
[23:57:09] <Cork> as most developers have there own taste in how they want there code highlighted
[23:59:26] <chinoto> Cork: well if you're going to highlight code, why on earth wouldn't strings be made obvious
[23:59:39] <Cork> strings sure
[23:59:48] <Cork> but differencing the first and second string isn't
[23:59:57] <Cork> (common)
