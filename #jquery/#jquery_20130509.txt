[00:00:12] <ravenzz> have you tried to debug it and see if there are js errors?
[00:00:25] <ravenzz> do you have a link to that page?
[00:00:42] <Gatito`K> local server, i dont have..
[00:00:58] <ravenzz> Gatito`K also do you really need round corners? Have you ever heard about gracefully degradation?
[00:01:18] <ravenzz> Gatito`K maybe you can create a testcase on jsfiddle.net ?
[00:01:23] <Gatito`K> corners are realy nice for buttons and etc..
[00:02:11] <ravenzz> Gatito`K honestly I tend to not fix those kind of stuff on legacy browsers
[00:02:36] <ravenzz> my CTO and I agree that they get what they deserve!
[00:02:44] <Gatito`K> ravenzz you aare very kind :D
[00:03:58] <ravenzz> they need a working website and they will survive without all the fancy stuff
[00:04:40] <coldhead> zach hill's face tat is a pretty great album for shitty work days
[00:05:06] <Gatito`K> nojavascript or errors on frebug
[00:05:20] <Gatito`K> no javascript errors on firebug
[00:05:24] <ravenzz> here is holiday huhu jesus' resurrection
[00:05:47] <ravenzz> in a country where the 90% of the people is atheist
[00:05:54] <ravenzz> :D
[00:08:32] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:09:43] <Gatito`K> ravenzz so you suggest to not use rounded corners? is there another known way to make corners in IE8?
[00:10:18] <coldhead> wear someone else's spectacles
[00:12:32] <ravenzz> Gatito`K dunno... PIE.htc? same stuff..but maybe it doesn't broke. Anyway you said that you are experiencing the issue on IE8, so debugging on FF doesn't make any sense :p
[00:12:55] <Gatito`K> yes you right
[00:13:17] <coldhead> isn't there something newer and better than PIE we're supposed to use now?
[00:13:24] <Gatito`K> i have developer tols in IE9 but i dont get how to use or is there any debugger
[00:13:32] <ravenzz> coldhead I don't know honestly
[00:13:44] <coldhead> snover was yelling about it in his inimitable style
[00:14:45] <Gatito`K> pie.htc seems to be a nice one...
[00:14:53] <ravenzz> Gatito`K F12 > switch to IE8 > open the Script tab and then click on "Start debugging"
[00:15:15] <Gatito`K> coldhead why there should be something better, is there any problems with this PIE? :)
[00:15:25] <Gatito`K> ravenzz thanks
[00:18:29] <coldhead> Gatito`K: i haven;t used it in years
[00:18:35] <coldhead> i heard there is something "better"
[00:18:39] <coldhead> but i can't find it
[00:18:46] <Gatito`K> hehe
[00:18:49] <Gatito`K> okei
[00:18:49] <coldhead> i tend to not give IE users nice features  like that
[00:18:55] <Gatito`K> why?
[00:18:55] <coldhead> they can get a new browser if they want
[00:19:14] <Gatito`K> they can, but there also may be some oldscool
[00:19:14] <Gatito`K> :D
[00:19:15] <coldhead> i ain't got time to  to make their old crummy browsers act nice and modern
[00:24:04] <Gatito`K> ravenzz coldhead - thanks .. PIE works realy fine and nice in IE8 :)
[00:43:10] <fabioportieri> does ever happen to you that a layout work differently between the same version of the same browser? like a difference in margins somewhere
[00:59:43] <sacho> between the same version of the same browser and?
[01:01:55] <fabioportieri> sacho: and?
[01:02:17] <fabioportieri> ?
[01:02:43] <s3b`> Hey I have an object that has a jquery element, and on drag I want to set the object's drag to True
[01:02:49] <s3b`> problem is, this.drag is referring to the dom element itself
[01:05:30] <s3b`> kinda like this: http://hastebin.com/nuxewebici.js
[01:11:05] <shoky> `w
[01:11:05] <b-ot> shoky: No cities match your search query
[01:11:13] <shoky> `w tel-aviv
[01:11:13] <b-ot> shoky: No cities match your search query
[01:11:17] <fabioportieri> sacho?
[01:11:59] <Forbidd3n> how would I check if an id starts with a string
[01:12:11] <Forbidd3n> I tried this, but seems to pull all parents
[01:12:16] <Forbidd3n> field.parents('div[id^="chose"]')
[01:13:31] <fabioportieri> maybe you want parent() ?
[01:14:59] <Forbidd3n> even with parent
[01:15:38] <Forbidd3n> still doesn't work with parent
[01:15:41] <Forbidd3n> or closest
[01:16:22] <fabioportieri> you mean the selector doesnt' filter?
[01:17:06] <hxm> hello good morning nice people
[01:17:13] <hxm> why all my jquery ui aspect is so big?
[01:17:29] <fabioportieri> hxm: there is a font size somewhere in the css
[01:17:51] <hxm> ok, i thought i did something wrong and the aspect got corrupted
[01:18:10] <hxm> btw tinymce editor works perfectly with jquery & editable content
[01:18:11] <Forbidd3n> it is selecting all items, not just parents with chose in it
[01:19:07] <Forbidd3n> fabioportieri: I am getting all fields, then looping and trying to get all the ones with parent that has id with chose in it
[01:19:36] <sacho_> how are you getting all fields
[01:19:45] <JohnnyCache> hi guys: i need a simple tooltip plugin that shows the tooltip when the user hovers an element with "title" attribute, something easy to customise
[01:20:51] <Forbidd3n> find('input:visible[class*="required-"]')
[01:22:44] <fabioportieri> and it works good?
[01:23:13] <Forbidd3n> yeah
[01:23:17] <Forbidd3n> I need some sort of filter on it
[01:23:30] <sacho_> what are you calling find on
[01:24:44] <Forbidd3n> the form id
[01:25:01] <fabioportieri> Forbidd3n: maybe a testcase..
[01:25:07] <Forbidd3n> it gets all fields, just need to filter out the ones that have a parent with id of chose
[01:25:47] <Forbidd3n> any one that might know of a filter() to put on it to get the ones with id of chose in it
[01:26:03] <fabioportieri> ah filter out?
[01:26:23] <Forbidd3n> yeah that would work, just not sure how to write the filter
[01:26:27] <sacho_> Forbidd3n, why don't you first select the parents with an id starting with chose, and then select their child fields.
[01:26:52] <Forbidd3n> the way it is written I can't do it that way
[01:31:44] <sacho_> yes, you can.
[01:44:23] <Gorkyman_HQ> hey guys... how would I pass a position value (.position) in Ui from the div that's being used on
[01:47:59] <JohnnyCache> hi guys: i need a simple tooltip plugin that shows the tooltip when the user hovers an element with "title" attribute, something easy to customise

[01:58:10] <xande17_> JohnnyCache: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[02:06:55] <edoop> hi need good framework solution to  develop  personal  streaming and recorder audio if possible between jquery
[02:07:20] <BadCodSmell> What you need my son, is google.
[02:07:54] <edoop> so advanced?
[02:09:51] <JohnnyCache> xande17_: everytime i put the mouse on the element the tooltip jumps up or down before it catches it's place :\
[02:12:46] <JohnnyCache> n/m i got it thanks :)
[02:15:26] <xande17_> JohnnyCache: You're welcome =]
[02:20:10] <Altreus> I've got a check-all checkbox, and it simply sets .prop('checked', true/false) on all the others. But I've discovered this isn't firing the change event on those - which I guess makes sense. Is there a way of bulk-checking a lot of checkboxes and having it fire the changed event for only those changed ones? It seems inefficient to loop myself.
[02:22:35] <fabioportieri> Altreus: you could trigger the change event when setting the prop
[02:23:15] <Altreus> fabioportieri: mm, but I would want to ensure only those that actually were changed by the procedure had their change fired
[02:23:59] <fabioportieri> and you can't do it?
[02:24:32] <Altreus> I can, but I'd sacrifice any optimisation I get from doing it to the jQuery object
[02:24:41] <Altreus> Because I'd have to go through them all and test
[02:24:56] <Altreus> So I was wondering whether I could do something to have jQuery do it for me
[02:24:59] <Altreus> hmm
[02:25:05] <Altreus> Actually I could filter() couldn't I
[02:25:23] <Altreus> Thanks, problem bear :D
[02:25:55] <fabioportieri> nop
[03:22:17] <jsmonkey> hi, when I use getJSON to get an .json file the callback is never invoked and a xhr object or something is returned since it has readystate, then etc.. (I dont use a promise if not jquery has changed to always use a promise even for getjson? was a while since i used jquery)
[03:22:47] <jsmonkey> anyone got a clue? I used to belive i just could do $.getJSON('theurl', function(data) {console.log(data)})
[03:23:00] <jsmonkey> when I inspect the network I can see that the response is the json file with all its data..
[03:24:25] <jsmonkey> any ideas?
[03:25:34] <rudiX> hello guys
[03:25:35] <jsmonkey> it works fine when I go against a backend route
[03:25:49] <jsmonkey> the problem only occurs when doing against a .json file in my public folder.
[03:26:45] <rudiX> how I can add function determining the mouse position on <img tag like this <img onmousemove="funct_here(event)
[03:27:26] <rudiX> i don't know why but $(element).on(mousemove ... does not work
[03:29:36] <jsmonkey> rudiX: it does.
[03:29:40] <jsmonkey> you probaly does it to early
[03:29:44] <jsmonkey> do it.
[03:29:57] <rudiX> on document ready?
[03:30:44] <jop008> any experts in json?
[03:30:56] <rudiX> lol
[03:31:02] <jop008> I want to translate sql query in json
[03:31:12] <jsmonkey> rudiX: I can't tell if you do it to early or not since I don't have your code. try to do it in the console in chrome or firefox.
[03:31:16] <jop008> my my sql tables are json records
[03:31:24] <jsmonkey> if it works there as it does. then its probaly a timing issue or a selector issue.
[03:31:35] <jop008> so how can I use innerjoin for the json tables
[03:31:44] <jsmonkey> $('span').on('mouseover', function() {console.log('mouse over span')})
[03:31:45] <rudiX> I am using sockets jsmonkey
[03:32:09] <rudiX> node.js probably breaking it
[03:32:13] <jsmonkey> rudiX: what I am trying to tell you is that the problem is not the mouseover. it's something else. and we can't know what it is since we dont have your code.
[03:32:30] <jsmonkey> try to break down it and try your chain in steps and then you will find the problem and then you can ask here
[03:32:59] <jsmonkey> $('span').on('mouseover', function() {console.log('mouse over span')}) this works. and does with an image as well
[03:33:09] <jsmonkey> so that is not your problem
[03:33:17] <rudiX> jsmonkey: I am also interested how to add jquery code directly on tag
[03:33:26] <rudiX> not because I am planning to use it
[03:33:33] <rudiX> just curious
[03:33:46] <jsmonkey> rudiX: don't :)
[03:34:00] <rudiX> hah ok :)
[03:44:10] <jonkristian_wrk> Can anyone see what's wrong here? http://pastie.org/7821989
[03:44:24] <jonkristian_wrk> I get Cannot call method 'data' of undefined
[03:58:32] <jgomes> jonkristian_wrk: did you tried  typeahead.data('page') instead of  typeahead.$element.data('page') ?
[03:59:18] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, did not try it, but I will do, thanks:) I am feeling very green when it comes to these "undefined" messages.
[04:02:18] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, now i get this: Uncaught TypeError: Object que has no method 'data'
[04:02:35] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, so one step closer as it shows me the actual query
[04:04:36] <jgomes> jonkristian_wrk: the typeahead is a jQuery object or is suppose to be?
[04:06:11] <jgomes> jonkristian_wrk: also, you not defined $element variable in the code you post... isn't that the probelm?
[04:07:19] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, the column?
[04:07:28] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, I've hardcoded it for now
[04:07:44] <jonkristian_wrk> still get the no method 'data' thing though
[04:07:59] <jonkristian_wrk> jgomes, I am using this example: http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?pid=15565#p15565
[04:17:41] <eager> hi all
[04:18:42] <eager> I'm trying to figure out how unprofessional it is to pour out .addClass('foo')'s within an .each() function...
[04:19:08] <eager> I mean, what happens, if the targeted element already has that class
[04:19:29] <eager> and within the each(), I may add the same 3 more times
[04:20:26] <eager> I'm looking at it here too, but cannot figure out (cannot read the code! :D ) how .addClass() works http://www.explainjs.com/explain?src=http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js
[04:21:41] <eager> basically, I just want to avoid checking if (this.hasClass('foo')), if jQuery's .addClass includes this check in itself
[04:21:49] <eager> wanna save an if
[04:23:20] <eager> to be certain, i have a wrapper with text inputs; if any of the inputs has value, I want to add a class to the common wrapper
[04:23:53] <eager> and I do it with .each() and the same class should go to the same element (the wrapper)
[04:43:17] <Jon47> eager - you can use toggleClass
[04:43:29] <Jon47> $whatever.toggleClass('foo', true);
[04:44:13] <Jon47> i think basically it's the same as checking first, and then adding
[04:44:50] <eager> ahha, i don't think it's exactly my usecase.... I wanna check upon page-load, if any of the textfields have value written into, and if yes, mark the wrapper with a class
[04:45:45] <eager> ah, i just don't see how is that, but thanks, i will contemplate it :)
[04:45:55] <Jon47> addClass does not claim that repetitive use will not result in accumulating class names although it seems in practice, in Chrome at least, that they do not accumulate
[04:46:25] <eager> currently I have only one marking class even if many textfields validate positive
[04:46:33] <eager> Jon47: exactly :)
[04:46:55] <Jon47> eager: why not do a regular javascript loop, then "break" after you add it first
[04:47:08] <Jon47> you can save your "if" as well as potentially some loop iterations as well
[04:47:53] <eager> wow, that' kind of advanced stuff for me - but serves my competence improvement a lot!
[04:48:01] <eager> thanks for the idea
[04:48:03] <Jon47> sure
[04:55:35] <cusco> hi

[05:47:39] <jop008> okay give it a try
[05:49:36] <jop008> no text in the middle of the screen

[06:04:37] <jo_> Ohai #jQuery.
[06:04:37] <RNT> BillCriswell, hello,
[06:04:44] <RNT> are you busy ?
[06:05:02] <BillCriswell> RNT: Always haha.
[06:05:07] <RNT> lol
[06:05:18] <BillCriswell> I could sneak in here for quick things, but some things just take too much time.
[06:05:30] <RNT> i have a quiq question for you :P
[06:05:35] <RNT> quick
[06:06:14] <eager> and this is "targeted crowdsourcing" :D
[06:10:06] <fabioportieri> i'm bored
[06:11:12] <eager> fabioportieri: read something :) http://flippinawesome.org/2013/05/06/5-things-you-should-stop-doing-with-jquery/
[06:14:45] <fabioportieri> nice
[06:20:02] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... I always thought .map was supposed to return the same number of things that went into it.
[06:20:27] <BillCriswell> Ah, he clarifies later, nice.
[06:23:08] <zissou> how to setup jquery to use themes?
[06:23:18] <zissou> i mean jquery-ui
[06:23:45] <BillCriswell> zissou: Should just include the theme file.
[06:23:48] <fabioportieri> there is a themebuilder on the site i think it comes to loading the appropriate css
[06:24:19] <zissou> where do i have to put the assets?in a folder where the library is?
[06:25:07] <BillCriswell> They're go wherever the CSS file is looking for them.
[06:25:46] <zissou> oh i see, on the site i can dl the dependencies also. so it sets them up automagically
[06:26:25] <BMCouto> Anyone here ever used scott's stylish select plugin?
[06:29:21] <xhoy> i have an input field with an .bind('change keyup') event, but when some other js file updates the field, that event doesn't get triggerd?
[06:29:29] <xhoy> what type of 'change' is that?
[06:30:11] <fabioportieri> it doesn't get triggered by a programmatic change
[06:30:22] <xhoy> ow
[06:30:28] <xhoy> so i need to hardcode the event?
[06:30:35] <fabioportieri> but you can do .trigger('change');
[06:31:01] <xhoy> so $().val("123").trigger('change') ?
[06:31:09] <fabioportieri> yes
[06:31:36] <xhoy> nice!
[06:31:38] <xhoy> thanks :)
[06:31:49] <fabioportieri> nop
[06:33:44] <zissou> so i linked to the jqeury ui custom. but theme isnt kicking in
[06:34:32] <BillCriswell> http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/ nice.
[06:35:17] <zissou> nevermind. fixed it. didnt link to the css :/
[06:35:27] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: ahhahsdsajlsfdfs
[06:35:33] <fabioportieri> plugin of the year
[06:36:15] <zulu-gula> I have 3 images nex to each other and would like to add flexslider instead for narrow-screen devices
[06:37:32] <pachet> zissou: i've never seen so many electric jellyfish
[06:38:25] <zissou> pachet, what are you talking about?
[06:38:58] <BillCriswell> Shut up, Steve.
[06:39:19] <pachet> doesnt even know how to hold a boom
[06:39:47] <BillCriswell> Been a while since I've watched that.
[06:39:59] <BillCriswell> Damn, almost 10 years old
[06:40:02] <pachet> yeah me too
[06:40:39] <BillCriswell> zissou: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/
[06:41:33] <zissou> oh right, didnt catch the reference.. nevertheless, i'll get you a pair of speedos and a red cap ;)
[06:41:39] <pachet> :D
[06:52:45] <zulu-gula> is there a plugin like jquery.mobile, but working with jquery 1.4?
[06:54:45] <fabioportieri> 1.4?
[07:05:57] <_mocas_> hi, I know that looks stupid, but I would like to run jquery on linux shell scripts of a batch of html files... is that possible?
[07:07:50] <fikst> _mocas_, what would you do on the html files?
[07:09:53] <_mocas_> I would like to use the jquery selectors, fikst
[07:10:21] <_mocas_> I have a lot of html files that I would like to extract some data
[07:10:40] <_mocas_> and like the jquery selector is so good, I would like to use it :)
[07:11:31] <_mocas_> if it is not possible I will have to shearch some doom tool for linux
[07:11:34] <fikst> its possible with php for ex: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1124271/php-domdocument-selectors-like-jquery-does-exist-something-like-that
[07:11:56] <fikst> if u want to use js, take a look at node.js
[07:12:38] <fikst> jquery can be used with node.js
[07:14:21] <BillCriswell> fikst: Would that be basically doing $( something.html ).find('.foo') ?
[07:14:54] <BillCriswell> I know you can't literally do that, but just pseudo code.
[07:15:58] <fikst> both the php and node option will give you a dom
[07:16:11] <fikst> and, yes you can do .find('.foo') on them
[07:16:26] <_mocas_> that look nice
[07:16:27] <BillCriswell> That's fun.
[07:16:35] <_mocas_> I  will study, thanks fikst
[07:16:37] <_mocas_> :)
[07:17:24] <BillCriswell> Would DOMXpath basically be able to do the same task ( given a simple selector )?
[07:18:07] <BillCriswell> Does jQuery still support XPath or is that a plugin or something now? lol
[07:18:16] <BillCriswell> Wonder how many people actually used xpath with it.
[07:19:25] <fikst> I never use DOMXpath, but it seems the selectors they use are based on regex
[07:19:36] <fikst> $xpath->query("*/div[@id='yourTagIdHere']");
[07:20:58] <BillCriswell> Yeah they can get nasty.
[07:24:34] <fabioportieri> yawn
[07:33:54] <mrHat> stock.text(stock.text()+1); i would expect this to increment the number i have in stock but it just adds 1 to the text
[07:33:56] <mrHat> why
[07:33:59] <MvpGraff> This might be a bit long, but I've been trying to get this to work D:
[07:34:05] <MvpGraff> http://jsfiddle.net/2AAr2/ validation tool
[07:34:27] <MvpGraff> it only seems to validate the First Name/Last Name/Email
[07:35:41] <fabioportieri> mrHat: use parseInt on stock.text()
[07:38:11] <mrHat> thanks
[07:39:26] <fabioportieri> nop
[07:44:42] <Fenikkusu> Can someone tell me which method is the best-practice for defining defaults and why it is the case? http://jsfiddle.net/vB9hT/
[07:50:38] <sandyRussell> I have this snippet in my code but when I go to the page containing this code I get allocation size overflow in the html concatenation line
[07:50:45] <sandyRussell> what's wring in there?
[07:50:49] <sandyRussell> wrong*
[07:51:45] <sandyRussell> the snippet is here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e49c753190d5f27b8cb0
[07:53:04] <sandyRussell> I have this snippet https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e49c753190d5f27b8cb0 in my code but when I go to the page containing this code I get allocation size overflow in the html concatenation line what's wrong in there
[07:53:33] <fabioportieri> Fenikkusu: what about that http://jsfiddle.net/vB9hT/1/
[07:56:01] <mrHat> $('.blah').text('bum'); blah gains focus... is there any way to stop that from happening ? it highlights the text when it gains focus and i don't like that
[07:56:21] <Fenikkusu> fabioportieri, While it is true that that is often times a commonly accepted method of defining defaults, going that route prevents the defaults from being changed outside of the code, meaning you have to redefine your settings every single time you instance the plugin, even if the only thing you change is one option. By defining the in a global context, you allow others to directly override...
[07:56:23] <Fenikkusu> ...your defaults such that they then only have to redefine the settings they change per instance.
[07:57:27] <BillCriswell> sandyRussell: What is picson?
[07:57:41] <sandyRussell> the json loaded from the url
[07:57:54] <sandyRussell> it's not a big json file at all
[07:58:00] <sandyRussell> just 8 objects
[07:58:44] <BillCriswell> It's only running once?
[07:59:19] <ohnobinki> Does http://bugs.jquery.com/search?q=jquery+default+event+window&go=&ticket=on give anyone else an infinite redirect loop?
[07:59:22] <ohnobinki> is that supposed to happen?
[07:59:41] <mrHat> $('.blah').text('bum'); blah gains focus... is there any way to stop that from happening ? it highlights the text when it gains focus and i don't like that
[07:59:44] <ohnobinki> and not an HTTP-level redirect loop, some JS thing
[08:00:19] <sandyRussell> BillCrisewell: I don't think it runs at all
[08:00:32] <sandyRussell> nothing shows up
[08:00:32] <fabioportieri> mrHat: .blur();
[08:00:43] <BillCriswell> sandyRussell: Have it live anywhere to take a look?
[08:00:48] <sandyRussell> ok
[08:01:16] <BillCriswell> mrmist: What kind of element is .blah?
[08:01:35] <BillCriswell> Oh, he left.
[08:01:39] <BillCriswell> Sorry mrmist.
[08:02:20] <BillCriswell> sandyRussell: Actually, just do $('#mydiv').append(html); and see how that goes.
[08:02:35] <sandyRussell> ok
[08:02:58] <sandyRussell> I did that already and the browser hangs alot
[08:03:03] <sandyRussell> so I thought about this
[08:03:26] <sandyRussell> so the html get appended all at once
[08:03:46] <sandyRussell> I just need to know what's causing such error
[08:04:00] <BillCriswell> sandyRussell: I don't think it's just that line of code.
[08:04:08] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ sandyRussell
[08:07:55] <sandyRussell> BillCrisewell: the code ran in jsfiddle with no problem I guess I have to check somehwhere else thank you so much
[08:07:57] <jo_> How do you guys test on Blackberry devices?
[08:10:10] <BillCriswell> sandyRussell: Welcome.
[08:18:16] <BillCriswell> Feeling like a crazy person here. Where is that undefined coming from? http://jsbin.com/ezogem/1/edit
[08:19:26] <jo_> Where is bill 0?
[08:19:39] <jo_> I see Bill1 defined, but your loop is going from 0 to 11.
[08:19:58] <BillCriswell> I don't have a Bill0 in there.
[08:20:04] <BillCriswell> Start at 1 for the name.
[08:20:07] <jo_> Nevermind.  Still undefined if I put that in.
[08:20:19] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: var html='';
[08:20:23] <jo_> Maybe the var html is showing up as undefined.
[08:20:35] <fabioportieri> it's the default value for var html
[08:20:45] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: That was it.
[08:20:46] <jo_> ^
[08:20:47] <BillCriswell> THanks.
[08:20:51] <fabioportieri> nop
[08:21:03] <jo_> Damn.  >:) I'll get you next time.
[08:21:08] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:21:21] <BillCriswell> That seems so weird to me.
[08:23:04] <fabioportieri> going home byee
[08:23:11] <BillCriswell> Later.
[08:23:45] <banister_> hi, can someone here explain the pipe() method for promises?
[08:23:47] <banister_> idgi
[08:24:01] <banister_> this tutorial just made things more confusing, too: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[08:24:45] <BillCriswell> banister_: You probably want to be using .then instead now.
[08:24:52] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/ deprecation notice there
[08:25:35] <banister_> BillCriswell: i thought 'then' was just used to define the done/fail callbakcs together?
[08:25:47] <banister_> and that 'pipe' was a different concept altogether
[08:25:52] <banister_> at least based on what that tutorial said
[08:28:47] <MvpGraff> Hey, can you take a look? Apparently my jquery is only validation First Name, Last Name, Email
[08:28:49] <MvpGraff> http://jsfiddle.net/2AAr2/
[08:29:26] <Solineoz> jo_ got it, the var html is undefined
[08:30:52] <jo_> I was responding to Bill's question.  :)
[08:30:58] <jo_> Wasn't I?  o_O
[08:31:24] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:44:11] <zzizz> Hey guys anyone know what plugin (if any) is used on http://sputnikcreative.com/ to give that opacity effect on the bottom items while scrolling.. how they are dim at the bottom but when you scroll they come to full opacity..
[08:44:12] <zzizz> thanks guys
[08:46:58] <VSpike> Hi. A 3rd party dev here wanted to deploy a modified (hacked) version of flexslider to randomize the starting slide, but I suggested this http://jsfiddle.net/xcWM5/1/
[08:47:59] <VSpike> They've come back with a problem - if they are selecting by class, and there are two divs on the page with the class match (and they want sliders on both) the $('.foo > ul > li').length only counts the first one... is there a neater solution for this?
[08:48:47] <scottmey> u/zzizz http://sputnikcreative.com/emberjs/build/home/index.js
[08:49:37] <VSpike> For some reason they say using { randomize: true } doesn't work for them - I don't know why
[08:57:58] <VSpike> Can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/scCwT/1/
[08:59:05] <tw2113> TypeError: elem is not a function
[09:00:02] <tw2113> VSpike, likely frm this part: elem('ul > li').length
[09:06:35] <VSpike> tw2113: is this better? http://jsfiddle.net/scCwT/2/ seems to work
[09:06:51] <DaniG2k> guys im trying to get a query to change depending on the checkboxes that are selected
[09:07:01] <tw2113> looks like it
[09:07:01] <DaniG2k> I suppose I need to use serialize and submit
[09:07:11] <DaniG2k> how can I access the checkboxes?
[09:07:13] <tw2113> is it doing what you expect VSpike ?
[09:07:16] <DaniG2k> sry, jQuery n00b here
[09:07:24] <VSpike> tw2113: as far as I can tell, it is, yes
[09:07:28] <zzizz> scottmey so they wrote their own ey
[09:07:33] <tw2113> no console errors
[09:07:53] <kzurawel> DaniG2k: you mean figure out what boxes are checked?
[09:08:11] <DaniG2k> yea
[09:09:03] <kzurawel> DaniG2k: you could do something like $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').each(function() {}) to loop through them
[09:09:23] <kzurawel> that selector (part before .each) will get you all the checked checkboxes
[09:09:23] <cusco> hi
[09:09:38] <DaniG2k> kzurawel: k thanks I'll see if I can figure it out
[09:10:10] <cusco> I'm using .ajax() twyce POSTing to a php, where I set some SESSIOn variables. for some reason calling second time, I can't access session variables set in the first time
[09:17:59] <JetaPack> hi
[09:19:43] <JetaPack> i'm working with datatable plugin and fancybox, all works perfect. the only problem is that my table returned many records, (more than 250). i have sorted the table for only show me 10 records per page.
[09:20:11] <MvpGraff> Is there better documentation for this? http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ the validation I'm using blows and isn't validating at all....
[09:20:45] <JetaPack> the idea is when i onclick the name of the row of the table show me a modal window with description of the row, the fancybox only works in the first page
[09:20:51] <JetaPack> that is my problem
[09:21:05] <JetaPack> I need show me the modal window in any page
[09:21:22] <DaniG2k> hmm
[09:21:27] <DaniG2k> so say I have three li elements
[09:21:43] <DaniG2k> with value="undergrad", value="postgrad", value="research"
[09:21:59] <DaniG2k> how can I find which are checked and then serialize that url?
[09:22:01] <BillCriswell> DaniG2k: Should not have value attributes on an <li>.
[09:22:07] <DaniG2k> ah
[09:22:16] <DaniG2k> BillCriswell: what should I have in li ?
[09:22:40] <BillCriswell> You should have an <input type="checkbox"> in the <li> I'm assuming.
[09:23:22] <BillCriswell> <input type="checkbox" name="marketing" value="Yes"> this will only be sent to the server if it's checked.
[09:23:31] <BillCriswell> It'll also only be serialized if it's checked.
[09:23:40] <DaniG2k> ah yeah
[09:23:42] <DaniG2k> sorry
[09:23:43] <DaniG2k> my bad
[09:23:51] <DaniG2k> the input type was within the li
[09:24:37] <DaniG2k> BillCriswell: so $("input[type='checkbox']:checked").each(function()  should take all the selected ones
[09:24:53] <BillCriswell> DaniG2k: Yes... but you just want to serialize them?
[09:25:02] <DaniG2k> yup
[09:25:20] <DaniG2k> but
[09:25:25] <DaniG2k> sorry total jQuery n00b
[09:25:36] <DaniG2k> where do I run .serialize() ?
[09:25:51] <DaniG2k> ("input[type='checkbox']:checked").each(function() { serialize() } ??
[09:27:46] <BillCriswell> DaniG2k: You can simply do  $('ul :checkbox').serialize();
[09:28:09] <BillCriswell> DaniG2k: http://jsbin.com/edufab/1/edit example here.
[09:29:22] <DaniG2k> BillCriswell: this is what I've got http://hpaste.org/87587
[09:29:53] <DaniG2k> will it work if I just do $("input[type='checkbox']:checked").
[09:29:54] <DaniG2k> serialize ?
[09:30:13] <BillCriswell> You don't need to do the type=checkbox and :checked part.
[09:30:56] <DaniG2k> ok
[09:31:15] <DaniG2k> BillCriswell: thanks
[09:31:36] <BillCriswell> $('#search-query-form').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); console.log($(this).find('ul :checkbox').serialze()) }); should get you going.
[09:32:03] <BillCriswell> serialize will ignore checkboxes that aren't checked by default, no reason to check to see if they're checked.
[09:32:23] <DaniG2k> awesome, thanks
[09:32:33] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[09:32:56] <JetaPack> someone could help me?
[09:35:45] <zzizz> Hey guys anyone know of a plugin that has similar functionality to http://sputnikcreative.com/ to give that opacity effect on the bottom items while scrolling.. how they are dim at the bottom but when you scroll they come to full opacity..
[09:35:57] <jgomes> JetaPack: don't ask for help just make the question
[09:36:20] <JetaPack> jgomes: I just asked here!
[09:36:46] <MvpGraff> oof
[09:36:48] <MvpGraff> i figured out my
[09:36:53] <MvpGraff> issue with that jquery validation
[09:36:54] <MvpGraff> - -
[09:37:01] <MvpGraff> id and name need to be the same
[09:37:02] <MvpGraff> D:
[09:37:36] <jgomes> JetaPack: sorry
[09:38:42] <JetaPack> i'm working with datatable plugin and fancybox, all works perfect. the only problem is that my table returned many records, (more than 250). i have sorted the table for only show me 10 records per page.
[09:38:51] <veQue> sigh, not a direct jq question, but the emmet plugin for notepad ++ can I use it to highlight/select a whole element?
[09:38:53] <JetaPack> the idea is when i onclick the name of the row of the table show me a modal window with description of the row, the fancybox only works in the first page
[09:39:07] <JetaPack> that is my problem
[09:39:34] <jgomes> JetaPack: if you add content to the page pragmatically you have to initialize the plugin (the fancybox modal) again
[09:40:23] <jgomes> JetaPack: for it to recognize the new created links
[09:40:26] <JetaPack> jgomes: How is that?
[09:42:29] <jgomes> JetaPack: I didn't see the code you have, but I bet the first time you enter the page the table is already there and you apply the fancy to the links, but when you click next the content is replaced by a new one via ajax request, right?
[09:42:42] <eager> I think they used to use .live() for this situation, which somehow was responsible for any "future" elements on the page...
[09:42:52] <eager> though .live() is deprecated now
[09:43:15] <eager> so I don't know what's the successor in this case
[09:43:56] <JetaPack> I'm going to show you my script
[09:44:49] <eager> .delegate() might worth looking into
[09:46:00] <JetaPack> http://pastebin.com/V61ZiNsA
[09:46:05] <eager> from 1.7, it appears to be .on(), which I never used...
[09:46:09] <JetaPack> That is my actual script!
[09:49:13] <eager> how about 72. line
[09:49:15] <eager> $(".link").click(function(){
[09:49:38] <eager> $(".link").on('click', function(){
[09:49:50] <eager> with the .on() in it? ^^
[09:50:04] <eager> I have never used, but guessing
[09:50:24] <konr> do you have the bookmark of that jquery plugins showcase site?
[09:50:36] <kzurawel> eager: that's the syntax. 'on' will do event delegation for you if you pass a selector as the second argument
[09:51:03] <kzurawel> e.g. $('.linkdiv').on('click', '.link', function() {});
[09:51:23] <kzurawel> will handle clicks on .link elements inside of .linkdiv, even if they are dynamically added to .linkdiv
[09:51:29] <kzurawel> .linkdiv just has to exist on the page first.
[09:51:30] <eager> JetaPack: ^^ look, try
[09:51:47] <eager> kzurawel++
[09:51:59] <eager> thank you
[09:52:04] <kzurawel> np. :)
[09:52:40] <kzurawel> eager: .live() is deprecated because it's the same as calling $(body).on() - not very efficient.
[09:53:02] <eager> I see, performance thingy
[09:53:04] <eager> cool
[09:53:16] <eager> aha, .on takes a smaller scope
[09:53:17] <jgomes> JetaPack: ok, I think I'm right, try replacing $(".link").click(function(){ with $('.link').bind('click', function() {
[09:54:32] <eager> jgomes: what you propose is just the same thing written different ways
[09:54:50] <jgomes> JetaPack: or like eager said, sorry eager, I didn't saw your awnswer
[09:55:25] <eager> np, afaik, .click() is a shortcut to .bind('click'), i don't know of any added effects
[09:56:11] <anthonym> guys, what'd cause my ajax post to not send the session cookie with it?  I've set the xhrFields, and it defintely is NOT cross domain
[09:56:53] <JetaPack> Like this ::  $(".link").on('click', ".link", function(){
[09:56:58] <JetaPack> Doesnt' works!!
[09:57:00] <snover> anthonym: session cookie fixed to a different path
[09:57:09] <jgomes> eager: you're right, my bad... your answer is the correct
[09:57:15] <anthonym> snover, can you explain a little for me?  I've read a fair bit of documentation
[09:57:19] <cusco> a different path?
[09:57:32] <anthonym> I don't get the different path reference, as the paths are exactly the same (same URL)
[09:57:44] <JetaPack> I believe the problem is with the dropdown select!!
[09:57:51] <JetaPack> But I don't know how can I fix it
[09:57:53] <snover> anthonym: session cookie that is expired
[09:58:14] <anthonym> tried that too, the site still holds both session cookies
[09:58:25] <kzurawel> JetaPack: your first selector ($('.link')) shouldn't be the same as what you put in the .on() call
[09:58:28] <anthonym> just one for the browsers initial load, and obviously a new one for the ajax calls
[09:58:42] <snover> anthonym: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http_cookie#Domain_and_Path
[09:58:47] <anthonym> so I assume the initial ajax call isn't sending the original session cookie
[09:58:47] <kzurawel> JetaPack: what is the container for your .link elements?
[09:59:13] <JetaPack> one div
[09:59:21] <kzurawel> does the div have a class?
[09:59:25] <kzurawel> or id?
[09:59:26] <anthonym> interesting thanks snover, so basically set the path to /*
[09:59:36] <JetaPack> yes
[09:59:47] <JetaPack> class='wrappFuncB'
[09:59:51] <snover> not unless you want it to only be sent for a request to /*
[10:00:03] <snover> or a page inside /*/
[10:00:04] <anthonym> is there a wildcard option?
[10:00:11] <kzurawel> Ok, use that as the selector, like this:  $('.wrappFuncB').on('click', '.link', function() {});
[10:00:17] <anthonym> to use 'any path on this domain'
[10:00:17] <snover> read, then re-read, the wikipedia article
[10:00:38] <snover> what you just asked is answered clearly in the second paragraph
[10:00:39] <jgomes> JetaPack: I think what you want is this syntax:  $(".link").on('click', function(){
[10:00:41] <kzurawel> JetaPack: that applies the handler (your function(){}) to clicks on .link elements inside of .wrappFuncB
[10:00:52] <anthonym> thanks
[10:01:07] <kzurawel> JetaPack: or do what jgomes is saying for all .link elements on the page *at the time your .on() runs*
[10:01:53] <jgomes> based on his code, I think is that
[10:02:00] <Zitter> I have N <div class="foo"><a>...</a><a>....</a><a>...</a></div> <div class="foo"><a>...</a><a>....</a><a>...</a></div> and so on. How to say "for a click on each <a> inside each <div>"? $("div.foo").click() ?
[10:03:35] <jgomes> JetaPack: worked?
[10:06:24] <jgomes> Zitter: try $("div.foo a").click()
[10:07:22] <Zitter> jgomes, yep
[10:07:26] <Zitter> thanks :)
[10:07:36] <jgomes> Ziber: welcome
[10:09:57] <Zitter> lol
[10:12:17] <BillCriswell> I keep mixing underscore and camel case in this class i'm writing, switching betwene languages is annoying.
[10:12:34] <rupee>  
[10:16:27] <adavia> hey guys is there anything wrong with $parent.find('.id_project').val() in this example  http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/  ?
[10:17:28] <BillCriswell> adavia: What do you get back if you console.log( this )?
[10:22:59] <adavia> BillCriswell:  i get .tableService
[10:26:41] <eager> adavia: why are using $ in $parent?
[10:27:02] <eager> isn't that unneccessary / confusing / dealbreaker?
[10:27:13] <adavia> eager:  beacuse i have multiple inputs with the same class
[10:27:31] <BillCriswell> eager: I use them to identify jQuery objects.
[10:27:48] <eager> i didn't know of such definition of variables, sorry
[10:27:56] * eager is rookie
[10:28:48] <BillCriswell> It's just a convention some people use. It's not needed.
[10:29:03] <eager> I see
[10:30:22] <BillCriswell> adavia: Are you sure you want to pass response to the success callback for  $.getJSON ?
[10:30:37] <adavia> BillCriswell:  so how can i get that input value without having to call $('.id_project').val()
[10:30:57] <BillCriswell> adavia: That would be the best way.
[10:31:09] <BillCriswell> If I'm understanding your question right.
[10:31:33] <adavia> BillCriswell:  i know but as i said before i have multiple inputs with the same class as im creating them dinamically
[10:32:16] <adavia> BillCriswell:  thats why im using the closest parent to get a value from a particular input
[10:32:49] <BillCriswell> That's the right way to approach it. I thought you were just doing an example with a simple element.
[10:33:51] <adavia> BillCriswell:  umm i see
[10:38:50] <BillCriswell> adavia: It looks like what you're doing is right. Is it just not getting that "pro" parameter?
[10:39:22] <adavia> BillCriswell:  yes sir
[10:39:55] <BillCriswell> What do you get if you console.log($parent)?
[10:40:26] <adavia> BillCriswell:  it gets the parameter if i just do $('.id_project').val() instead $parent.find('.id_project').val() but not with the desirable behaviour
[10:41:48] <BillCriswell> adavia: What do you get if you log $parent?
[10:42:47] <adavia> BillCriswell:  [prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1], context: undefined, jquery: "1.9.1", constructor: function, init: function…]
[10:43:08] <adavia> im not quiet good using the console to debug
[10:44:40] <BillCriswell> What about console.log($parent[0]) ?
[10:45:03] <Soltis> I've got a page which uses jQuery UI for collapsing elements ... I'm trying to figure out how to restore the window state if a user leaves the page and then clicks the back button in their browser.
[10:47:42] <adavia> BillCriswell:  undefined
[10:48:03] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:48:10] <chrisbolton> Anyone familiar with using select2 and the gem nested_form in Rails?
[10:50:04] <BillCriswell> And you're sure that this was .tableService but $(this).closest('.fieldwrapper') is still somehow undefined?
[10:52:24] <GAEfan> Hi.  New to query.  I am using .ajax() to upload a file.  I want to have an "overwrite?" dialog if the file already exists.  If the best way to use the beforeSend() option to check if exists?  Or is there a better way?
[10:54:06] <adavia> BillCriswell:  this is what i get when i log this
[10:54:08] <adavia> e.(anonymous function).(anonymous function) {element: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1], uuid: 15, eventNamespace: ".autocomplete15", options: Object, bindings: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[3]…}
[10:59:56] <GAEfan> anyone?
[11:01:47] <konr> well, the server has to tell you that
[11:02:12] <konr> because when is a file the same? When it has the same name? The same content?
[11:03:25] <Forbidd3n> This would only put the element before if the input field isn't disabled, correct?
[11:03:26] <Forbidd3n> $(this).filter(function(){ return !this.attr('disabled') }).before( div );
[11:04:11] <Forbidd3n> ah I can use is(':disabled');
[11:07:46] <JetaPack> I come back!!
[11:11:08] <JetaPack> jgomes: are you there still?
[11:12:28] <jgomes> JetaPack: yes
[11:12:32] <JetaPack> Ok
[11:12:51] <JetaPack> I found the problem, But I still the problem follows!!
[11:13:42] <JetaPack> The problem is the first function .change()
[11:18:45] <jgomes> JetaPack: what about it?
[11:19:24] <JetaPack> The problem I exposed since a moment ago!
[11:20:05] <psyferre> Hey folks, can anyone think  of an apache setting or something that would disable some selectors in jquery?  I have a very odd case... a page that used to work fine now returns null for all jquery selectors after a server upgrade.  I can do document.getElementsByTagName('active') just fine, but  $('.active') returns null.  o.0
[11:20:50] <psyferre> If anyone can push me toward a clue I'd really appreciate it.  Not having much luck with my googling.
[11:21:34] <NoiseEee> psyferre: apache has nothing to do with javascript.
[11:21:35] <monk12> hey all, anyone know any plugins that move options from one multiple-select to another?
[11:21:38] <shoky> $('.active') doesnt look for elements by tag name
[11:21:43] <kzurawel> psyferre: getElementsByTagName returns elements.... by tag name. ".active" is a class name...
[11:22:04] <monk12> like a multiple select list, and click an arrow to move it to a 2nd list to the right of it.
[11:22:20] <NoiseEee> monk12: that's something that you'd write yourself, fairly easily
[11:22:58] <psyferre> Okay, I'm using the wrong javascript as a test.  In any case, I've got html on the page with class "active" and jquery returns null...
[11:23:24] <kzurawel> psyferre: $('.active') returns null?
[11:23:46] <kzurawel> can you put an example in a jsfiddle?
[11:23:50] <psyferre> NoiseEee: I would agree... just grasping at straws for something that might cause the problem.  There have been no code changes, I just moved to a new server with an upgrade to Coldfusion.
[11:23:51] <JetaPack> jgomes: How can I store a var with a function instead of this ::  $("#edit-res-content").on('change', function(){})
[11:24:19] <JetaPack> http://jsfiddle.net/7pyTp/
[11:24:26] <psyferre> kzurawel: Yup.  REturns nothing.
[11:24:27] <NoiseEee> psyferre: and putting "$('.active')" in your console spits out what, exactly
[11:24:54] <psyferre> NoiseEee: "null"
[11:25:22] <monk12> k just curious.
[11:25:23] <NoiseEee> with your page loaded it spits out null?
[11:25:28] <psyferre> Yup.
[11:25:44] <monk12> http://www.stevefenton.co.uk/cmsfiles/assets/File/twosidedmultiselect.html This seems pretty close too :)
[11:25:55] <NoiseEee> maybe you're not using jquery, do you have a public page?  jquery simply does not return 'null' on selector queries.
[11:27:18] <psyferre> That's what has me so flabbergasted.  The actual issue I'm trying to solve is that a pic gallery has stopped working, and the console reports TypeError: $(...) is null, and references the selector that would be finding the gallery div.  So I started using the console to try to figure out why...
[11:27:23] <jgomes> JetaPack: var a = function(){
[11:27:35] <psyferre> NoiseEee: Public page: http://www.prucalarnold.com/
[11:27:44] <jgomes> JetaPack: is that?
[11:27:45] <NoiseEee> psyferre: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'fadeGallery' of null
[11:28:18] <NoiseEee> psyferre: first of all, you need to accurately find your problem, $('.active') does NOT return null in console, so why make that up?
[11:28:33] <NoiseEee> psyferre: when you are debugging an issue thats not the issue, its hard to get help.
[11:28:35] <JetaPack> jgomes: I not believe!!
[11:28:52] <kzurawel> NoiseEee: Whatever he's doing, that's legit.
[11:29:07] <kzurawel> psyferre: document.querySelectorAll('.active') on that page finds the .active
[11:29:17] <jgomes> JetaPack: http://jsfiddle.net/EnAkU/
[11:29:23] <NoiseEee> psyferre: if anything, it sounds like the server move might have changed some paths you are using, because that library is just simply not loaded.
[11:29:23] <kzurawel> but $('.active') does return null.
[11:29:30] <jgomes> you mean that?
[11:29:47] <NoiseEee> kzurawel: ah yes my apologies psyferre
[11:29:58] <kzurawel> psyferre: you do realize you're loading jquery twice?
[11:30:13] <NoiseEee> and mootools.
[11:30:19] <kzurawel> psyferre: NoiseEee: jQuery('.active') works
[11:30:41] <jgomes> JetaPack: I just can't understand what you want, besides that
[11:30:45] <kzurawel> There's a conflict between the two jqueries over who gets to use '$'
[11:30:55] <NoiseEee> kzurawel: not to mention mootools.
[11:31:15] <kzurawel> NoiseEee: That too.  :)
[11:32:02] <psyferre> kzurawel, NoiseEee:  Okay, glad you're seeing the issue... I haven't seen anything that failed to load... This is an inherited application that has seen a few other hands (hence the mootools, which is actually in use elsewhere in the application).  Prior to the server move, all conflicts had been resolved, as far as I'm aware..
[11:32:33] <JetaPack> jgomes: see, for example I go to page "4" and then I change the select option by "view" and allow me see them
[11:32:35] <NoiseEee> psyferre: well i doubt it. anyways, fix the issues we mentioned and see what happens.
[11:32:40] <JetaPack> that is the problem
[11:33:13] <JetaPack> But If I first change the option of dropdown list and then pass to another page, doesn't allow me view
[11:33:17] <JetaPack> Understand me?
[11:33:18] <psyferre> kzurawel, NoiseEee: In any case, it was working prior to the move.  Most likely the upgrade in CF caused some weird behavior somewhere that lead to extra libraries being loaded.  I'll track down where the extras are. :)  Thanks!
[11:35:25] <robert_> so, is there a free-ish accordion-tab control that I can fix to the bottom of the browser's viewport?
[11:35:41] <jgomes> JetaPack: I think so.... give me a moment
[11:35:50] <JetaPack> Ok
[11:39:04] <cusco> what is the join() for jquery
[11:39:20] <cusco> there is a array in json
[11:39:27] <cusco> and I want to concat the strings
[11:39:36] <cusco> do I need .each() ?
[11:40:17] <kzurawel> cusco: just do it with javascript. array.join('')
[11:41:23] <cusco> right thanks jsut found out
[11:41:24] <cusco> :)
[11:41:32] <shoky> robert_: jquery-ui no good?
[11:42:03] <robert_> hm
[11:42:12] <robert_> shoky: http://test.psiglenmere.com/
[11:42:23] <robert_> trying to get that to work the way I want.
[11:45:52] <shoky> ok
[11:49:56] <psyferre> kzurawel, NoiseEee:  Mootools was the culprit!  Thank you.  Something in the server upgrade must have "fixed" old logic that I wasn't aware of, causing mootools to be loaded on this page.  Eventually I'll rewrite all the old junk in jquery and never have to deal with it again.  Thanks!
[11:50:23] <kzurawel> psyferre: congrats.  :)
[11:50:45] <psyferre> Thanks. :)
[11:50:55] <NoiseEee> psyferre: sweet
[11:56:29] <JetaPack> jgomes: know how it does to fix?
[11:59:09] <Soltis> I've got a page which uses jQuery UI for collapsing elements ... I'm trying to figure out how to restore the window state if a user leaves the page and then clicks the back button in their browser.
[11:59:14] <jgomes> JetaPack: http://jsfiddle.net/GkMLX/1/
[11:59:56] <jgomes> JetaPack: sorry i've been a little busy
[12:00:23] <cusco> how can I .append() as html
[12:00:29] <cusco> the string i'm appending has <br />
[12:01:01] <jgomes> JetaPack: so?
[12:01:37] <Qiller> Hi all, if i input 1/5/23 to 10/5/13 dates, can i count interval days with jquery? ex.: 2/5 3/5 4/5 5/5 ...
[12:03:26] <jgomes> cusco: $('.inner').append('<p>Test</p>'); ?
[12:04:05] <cusco> I have a variable with a string a = "a<br />b<br />c"
[12:04:08] <JetaPack> jgomes: Yes works ok
[12:04:11] <JetaPack> Tkz
[12:04:17] <cusco> if I do $(#element).append(a);
[12:04:26] <cusco> it won't show the br />'s
[12:04:32] <jgomes> JetaPack: you're welcome
[12:04:47] <Qiller> jgomes: can you help me
[12:05:19] <cusco> nvm
[12:05:25] <cusco> I was doing it wrong sorry
[12:06:30] <jgomes> Qiller: jQuery is for manipulating DOM, to do that you have to use the plain javascript Date object and methods
[12:07:44] <jgomes> cusco: try removing the forward slash from the br tag
[12:07:48] <Qiller> jgomes: know any method javascript to say all date interval ?
[12:08:27] <Qiller> show dates between two dates
[12:08:29] <kzurawel> Qiller: if you need heavy-duty date manipulation, look into something like Moment.js
[12:08:41] <kzurawel> http://momentjs.com/
[12:08:56] <jgomes> Qiller: just take a look at the javascript Date object: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[12:09:17] <Qiller> going to momentjs

[12:27:44] <wachpwnski> If your ajax requests returns 324 code, does that fall under fail?
[12:28:23] <reed> Hey Queriers, I want to write a jQuery Style Guide for my team, anyone have any good resources to begin?
[12:28:24] <anthonym> depends if you want ajax to return 324 or not
[12:28:34] <anthonym> if you want it to, then you've succeeded.
[12:29:15] <Soltis> I've got a page which uses jQuery UI for collapsing elements ... I'm trying to figure out how to restore the window state (which elements were collapsed or uncollapsed) if a user leaves the page and then clicks the back button in their browser.
[12:29:53] <reed> wachpwnski: it depends what you're requesting via ajax. If it's an API then it could be an appropriate code.
[12:30:38] <reed> wachpwnski: If you're trying to .load() a webpage, it's probably a Bad Thing though.
[12:31:24] <reed> Soltis: You want to store the state in localStorage, probably.
[12:31:28] <wachpwnski> reed, i am saying if a make an ajax call $.get to an endpoint that returns Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE): The server closed the connection without sending any data.  will .fail() execute?
[12:32:21] <reed> wachpwnski: Ah, much better phrasing. No idea! Deserves a test.
[12:32:21] <gryg> Hello, I need to develop jquery plugin  that manages widgets (div with .widget class) and I am thinking if it is possible to call some setup function when page is ready, but when accessing widget with ex. $('#myTestWidget').Widget().minimize() the setup function should not launch again.
[12:32:43] <jgomes> Soltis: you could save the open ones in a cookie
[12:34:35] <Soltis> jgomes, reed: So what's a correct way to store the state? And what's a correct way to restore it later?
[12:36:26] <jgomes> Soltis: "The jQuery.localStorage() method uses the native localStorage, if the localStorage object not available, the storage will be handled with cookies as fall back method."
[12:36:49] <reed> jgomes: Did not know that! Awesome!
[12:37:04] <jgomes> old browsers don't support local storage
[12:37:10] <Soltis> jgomes: I know that.
[12:37:20] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[12:37:33] <Soltis> jgomes: What I don't know is an intelligent way to take an arbitrary set of elements, record their states, translate that record to a string, and then later do the process in reverse.
[12:37:35] <reed> jgomes: Ah that's a plugin? jQuery.localStorage(0
[12:37:51] <reed> Soltis: JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
[12:39:03] <Soltis> reed: I'm also not 100% sure what state I have to record.
[12:39:12] <reed> Soltis: so you have a map, ex. widgetsCollapsed = { name1: true, name2: false }, then localStorage.widgetsCollapsed = JSON.stringify(widgetsCollapsed)
[12:39:18] <jgomes> Soltis: well I would have to read the doc of the plug-in....
[12:39:37] <reed> Soltis: and then later, JSON.parse(localStorage.widgetsCollapsed) and you have your map back
[12:39:47] <Soltis> reed: Right, that makes sense.
[12:40:13] <Soltis> What I was hoping is to figure out a way to "trick" jQuery UI into re-handling the input values of the form inputs on page transition.
[12:40:33] <Soltis> Which, since the UI state is based on form input state, would have the effect I want implicitly.
[12:41:59] <reed> Soltis: Not following, sorry
[12:42:20] <reed> jgomes: Are you talking about jquery.storage.js plugin?
[12:42:52] <jgomes> well I know that's possible... there's some property that you could set on plug-in init to set it's state
[12:43:45] <Soltis> jgomes: Was that directed at me?
[12:44:10] <jgomes> Soltis: yes
[12:44:46] <jgomes> reed: http://www.jquerysdk.com/api/jQuery.localStorage
[12:45:00] <jgomes> is the jquery SDK :P
[12:45:37] <jgomes> but should be others
[12:46:26] <Soltis> jgomes: So any idea where I can read to figure out what property needs to be set, and how?
[12:46:52] <jgomes> what plug-in? acordion?
[12:47:01] <reed> jgomes: Never heard of this SDK! Thanks!
[12:47:36] <jgomes> reed: you're welcome ;)
[12:47:49] <Soltis> jgomes: I think so. Just standard collapsing/uncollapsing UI elements -- no accordion style stuff (if I understand the term correctly) in use that I'm aware of.
[12:48:26] <Soltis> jgomes: Accordion is the thing where you have, say, a few headers, only one of which can be "open" at a tiem?
[12:48:29] <Soltis> time*
[12:49:05] <jgomes> Soltis: yap
[12:49:15] <jgomes> Soltis: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#sortable
[12:49:33] <Forbidd3n> If I do .slideDown("slow", function(){ return var; }); - how do I reference the var outside of the slideDown?
[12:50:09] <Forbidd3n> I tried to set a variable outside of the slideDown var invalid; and then set invalid=false in the slideDown complete function, but doesn't work
[12:50:30] <jgomes> Forbidd3n: depends of the context where you're running that
[12:50:40] <Soltis> jgomes: Yeah, this isn't doing that -- just, say, a checkbox: "Do you have a car? Y/N" (it's actually a radio button underneath) and if you select "Y" then it uncollapses a div which has input for make/model.
[12:51:24] <Soltis> jgomes: Of course, that would be the same as a single-section accordion.
[12:51:49] <Forbidd3n> I need to pass a variable outside of the function
[12:54:23] <jgomes> Soltis: that's diferent... what you want is a collapsible element
[12:55:05] <reed> Forbidd3n: throw it in a jsfiddle.net, it sounds like you're looking for a closure, which is a very hard problem to solve via chat alone :)
[12:57:45] <funhouse> Hey there just wondering if anyone knows of any cool particle or special effect plugins sort of like this --> http://larsjung.de/twinkle/
[12:59:27] <jgomes> Soltis: http://www.darreningram.net/pages/examples/jQuery/CollapsiblePanelPlugin.aspx
[12:59:28] <Soltis> jgomes: Okay. Well, I need to know how to un-collapse these elements if the user hits the back button to the page. Also how to make the check-boxes appear to be checked; I'm sure the underlying radio button keeps its value (all the other form inputs do), but the visual overlay doesn't keep its state on some browsers.
[13:00:14] <jgomes> Soltis: cool h?
[13:00:23] <Soltis> jgomes: ?
[13:00:54] <jgomes> Soltis: isn't that?
[13:01:07] <cen0bi1e> funhouse: http://lab.hakim.se/
[13:01:19] <Soltis> jgomes: It's nifty. Seems very similar to what this page is doing already.
[13:01:35] <Soltis> jgomes: The problem isn't making the page work, it's making it remember what it was doing when we go back to it later.
[13:01:39] <Forbidd3n> ok read, http://jsfiddle.net/UNkJ4/
[13:01:41] <Soltis> jgomes: (I.e., hit the back button)
[13:01:42] <funhouse> cen0bi1e: checking now thank you!
[13:02:57] <Forbidd3n> reed: you will see the variable didn't change
[13:02:59] <jgomes> Soltis: you just have to save the open ones and on page load set it's state
[13:03:13] <Forbidd3n> I need it to change it globally so it is accessible after the function
[13:03:26] <Soltis> jgomes: Okay. And what about the pretty checkbox-y overlay thing?
[13:03:40] <jgomes> Soltis: or the closed ones, depending of the plug-in you're using
[13:04:38] <reed> Forbidd3n: The first alert says "true", the second one (clicking the button again) says "false"
[13:04:40] <Soltis> jgomes: So there's no way to basically make it "cascade" from the value of the inputs? I guess not, as the code probably doesn't assume it's necessarily an input triggering the collapse/uncollapse.
[13:05:19] <reed> Forbidd3n: The code "valid = false;" is in the success function, so it runs only after the animation ends.
[13:06:44] <jgomes> Soltis: you have to make that "cascade" thing... just iterate over each one and set it state
[13:12:34] <chrisbolton> Anyone familiar with the select2 library? I'm having a workflow issue. I've passed in a previously selected value into my form input field but select2 is not translating it into select2 magic.
[13:16:13] <Soltis> jgomes: How should I query the state, anyway?
[13:17:38] <jgomes> Soltis: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[13:17:56] <jgomes> al see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3479447/jquery-ui-accordion-that-keeps-multiple-sections-open
[13:18:10] <jgomes> Soltis: also see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3479447/jquery-ui-accordion-that-keeps-multiple-sections-open
[13:22:11] <Soltis> jgomes: It looks like I was mistaken -- they're using bootstrap for the collapsing.
[13:22:14] <Soltis> jgomes: This page is *not* organised.
[13:24:28] <jgomes> Soltis: this?: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#collapse
[13:24:43] <Soltis> jgomes: I believe so.
[13:26:04] <Soltis> jgomes: Specifically, the section "You can also use the plugin without the accordion markup"
[13:27:33] <jgomes> Soltis: well I think you have to use his events then
[13:28:30] <Soltis> jgomes: Looks that way.
[13:28:31] <jgomes> Soltis: to keep track of the selected ones, or just use the checkboxes states
[13:28:44] <Soltis> jgomes: Urk. This isn't what I'm good at.
[13:29:05] <jgomes> Soltis: relax men
[13:31:33] <jgomes> Soltis: I have to go now... take care
[13:32:32] <Soltis> jgomes: Thanks.
[13:32:51] <jgomes> Soltis: no prob and good luck

[13:34:22] <dalnet22> setting a raphael circle as a draggable works fine. the drag event fires
[13:35:55] <dalnet22> ok I had to set the tolerance on droppable. It works now

[13:39:49] <hellyeah> hey
[13:39:50] <hellyeah> have three surveys which is in seperate page. When user login the system i want to do a box that user can type a survey number. And when user enter survey number, user should be automatically directed to spesific survey page. Is it possible to do that
[13:44:24] <dalnet22> hmm, so tolerance isn't making much of a difference. I have to exactly line up one draggable circle with a droppable circle for it to acknowledge the drop
[13:44:41] <dalnet22> when I set tolerance to 'touch', it still requires that they fit perfectly. weird

[13:57:10] <JetaPack> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:57:39] <JetaPack> royalty: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:57:41] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to reset a variable outside of slideDown in slideDown
[13:58:27] <Forbidd3n> it is reseting it, but not before it continues to the next step
[13:59:10] <reed> Ah!
[13:59:32] <reed> Forbidd3n: I think your problem is Asynchronous code. one second.
[14:00:09] <Forbidd3n> yes, I couldn't think of the word,that is it
[14:00:16] <Forbidd3n> now for a fix
[14:00:17] <Forbidd3n> ...
[14:00:27] <reed> http://jsfiddle.net/u2hBv/3/
[14:00:41] <reed> Forbidd3n: Answer: don't use the function inside slidedown, just do it before you call slidedown
[14:01:20] <Forbidd3n> the issue is that I need a field within the up element, I can't access it until it isn't hidden
[14:01:29] <Forbidd3n> therefore I have to wait for slideDown to finish
[14:01:39] <madprops> should I compare an empty string '' with == or === ?
[14:01:41] <madprops> I
[14:01:53] <madprops> I use == but ace editor suggests ===
[14:02:06] <jost> === is probably better
[14:02:10] <reed> madprops: The rule of thumb is "always === unless you have a reason not to"
[14:02:12] <NoiseEee> madprops: in general with JS, === is the wya to go
[14:02:23] <madprops> what would be a reason not to?
[14:03:08] <reed> Forbidd3n: The function that goes in slideDown only happens after the animation, but the code continues
[14:03:31] <reed> Forbidd3n: So alert is called before the "success function", so you need to instead call another function from within the "success function"
[14:04:44] <reed> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/u2hBv/5/
[14:05:18] <reed> Forbidd3n: Or you can force the program to wait the amount of time the animation takes
[14:06:07] <reed> Forbidd3n: Forcing a wait: http://jsfiddle.net/u2hBv/6/
[14:06:34] <unstable> http://jsfiddle.net/kjy112/ZLuTg/ ... How can I make it so when you click on the Infowindow.. it does some action?
[14:11:25] <jmiller> question.  I am a novice with jquery.  I am using the DataTables plugin to create a editable table.  When the table renders in the browser, it isn't showing any of the buttons or row highlighting.
[14:12:01] <mobile8> hi, i want to have a radio player at my site that opens in a popup and plays my stream (without the user having to open winamp etc)
[14:12:04] <mobile8> is there a good plugin for this?
[14:12:10] <mobile8> jquery plugin, or anything else
[14:12:14] <reed> jmiller: Your new best friend: jsfiddle.net
[14:12:44] <jmiller> reed, is that the same as "fiddler"?
[14:13:37] <reed> jmiller: nono, check it out, this is a fiddle someone in this room posted about a few minutes ago
[14:13:38] <reed> http://jsfiddle.net/kjy112/ZLuTg/
[14:13:54] <reed> It's just a way to pass examples of browser work around
[14:13:57] <jmiller> thanks reed.
[14:16:44] <dalnet22> I hate those times when you spend an entire day trying to fix one issue and you get nowhere.
[14:17:11] <reed> dalnet22: This is one of those days for me, which is why I'm hanging out on this channel :-D Don't tell my boss
[14:17:18] <dalnet22> hah
[14:17:52] <kensith> http://jsfiddle.net/NumHf/2/  // basically i have this, when i click remove the alert() pops-up, but in my app it doesn't do anything and e.preventDefault() deosn't run either.
[14:18:39] <kensith> it blows my mind, that it works in jsFiddle and not my app.
[14:18:48] <kzurawel> kensith: your .parent() call is the issue
[14:19:12] <kzurawel> kensith: .remove_item doesn't have tr as a parent. You probably want .closest() instead of .parent()
[14:19:39] <kensith> cool. that was my next issue. thanks kzurawel
[14:20:28] <kensith> But whats making me confused is when I use that code ( ignoring the .remove() line ) in my app the alert() doesn't occur. but if i type $('.remove_item').click() in the console it does
[14:21:04] <kensith> I'm also not great at javascript.
[14:22:18] <kensith> of course that <tr> was added using clone(). Could that be why, for some reason, my links with .remove_item class aren't executing?
[14:23:21] <kzurawel> kensith: if you added them to the page after your .click(function() {}) ran, that would do it
[14:23:40] <zzizz> Hey guys anyone know of a plugin that has similar functionality to http://sputnikcreative.com/ to give that opacity effect on the bottom items while scrolling.. how they are dim at the bottom but when you scroll they come to full opacity..
[14:23:54] <kensith> kzurawel: ya they are added when you click a different button.
[14:25:08] <kzurawel> kensith: you'll want to change the .click() to .on(), so that the events get fired on new stuff too. Are the add/remove buttons inside your table?
[14:25:30] <kensith> kzurawel: just remove buttons in the table.
[14:26:05] <kzurawel> kensith: try changing your remove handler to something like this:  $('#items').on('click', '.remove_item', function(e) {})
[14:26:27] <kensith> kzurawel:will do and i'll let you know. appreciate your time
[14:26:37] <kzurawel> you're selecting the table (#items), and then applying a click handler to all the .remove_item elements inside it, even ones that get added after the handler was defined
[14:26:57] <kzurawel> if you've got dynamically-created add buttons, you'll need to do something similar for them too
[14:27:41] <kensith> kzurawel: that worked like a charm, thanks a ton
[14:28:04] <kzurawel> kensith: np
[14:30:13] <kensith> kzurawel: i learn something new everyday with javascript. its definitely something different for me.
[14:37:31] <chovy> does jquery 1.6.1 not support $(window).on() ?
[14:39:47] <khmer> chovy: .on() began in 1.7
[14:39:50] <khmer> chovy: use .bind()
[14:40:08] <chovy> khmer: actually, is it possible to use two version of jQuery on the same page?
[14:40:18] <chovy> I want to sandbox my code and have it use jquery 1.9
[14:40:21] <khmer> chovy: yes, but it usually means you're doing something bad
[14:40:41] <khmer> chovy: use $.noConflict
[14:41:17] <chovy> it's not your typical setup. I'm developing a bookmarklet, which will run any page on the web....I've been checking if jQuery is already loaded, but now realize, it may be loaded, but an outdated version...so I want my bookmarklet code to load its own version of jQuery.
[14:48:09] <Forbidd3n> reed, still same issue I need to reset valid to false and return in the parent function
[14:51:25] <reed> Forbidd3n: Then you'll have to use the setTimeout method, you just have to wait until the animation is done
[14:51:47] <dan2k3k4> so I'm using Mobile_Detect PHP library, can I just import jquery mobile (latest) instead of jquery 1.9.1? would everything work normally?
[14:52:35] <Forbidd3n> reed: how would I wait until timeout method is done before returning the valid for the parent function
[14:54:19] <reed> Forbidd3n: Ah good point… I can't answer that immediately. For the record, the ways I should you are "correct" Javascript. Waiting for something that happens asynchronously is not the JS way.
[14:55:35] <Forbidd3n> I can't be the only person that has this delimma
[14:56:51] <reed> Forbidd3n: You aren't, sorry to be tough but that's just not the right way to do things. JavaScript doesn't "Wait" like a puppy, like Java
[14:57:21] <reed> Forbidd3n: There could totally be a solution, but I don't know it.
[14:58:19] <reed> Forbidd3n: Most likely, you should split out the code below .slideDown() in the parent function into another function, and call that from the "success" method of .slideDown()
[15:05:15] <reed> I feel like a mean parent now
[15:06:41] <reed> Any JS guru's in here that could chime in? Forbidd3n wants to "wait" for a callback to be called before continuing with a parent function… is there any way?
[15:12:48] <pachet> Forbidd3n, reed: use callbacks, no question
[15:13:02] <pachet> i couldnt find a link to what you're doing in my buffer
[15:14:57] <Forbidd3n> reed: I figured out a solution that works, I have a class position:absolute and opacity:0
[15:15:10] <Forbidd3n> therefore I can check for non hidden fields without sliding
[15:15:17] <reed> Forbidd3n: Excellent :)
[15:15:30] <Forbidd3n> works?
[15:15:43] <Forbidd3n> it works, solution good?
[15:15:47] <reed> Forbidd3n: yes!
[15:17:10] <juboba> I need to make a post request but not with ajax
[15:17:33] <reed> juboba: Build a form, and then .submit() it :)
[15:17:38] <juboba> I've done this before by creating a form and submitting it, but I know there must be a better way
[15:18:01] <reed> juboba:  the only other solution I've seen/done is this:
[15:18:06] <juboba> oh
[15:18:06] <juboba> ok
[15:18:30] <reed> juboba: $.post('http://url.com', function () { location.href = location.href })
[15:18:48] <reed> This refreshes the page when the post completes, but it's not perfect
[15:19:23] <pachet> why cant you use ajax
[15:20:36] <pachet> juboba: you can also point a form submission to an iframe to get the same effect without a redirect
[15:20:42] <JosephSilber> reed: why not just window.location.reload()
[15:21:15] <JosephSilber> Then you can do $.post('url', window.location.reload)
[15:21:21] <reed> JosephSilber: +10 for teaching me something
[15:24:01] <juboba> I could use ajax, but I need to reload either way
[15:24:13] <juboba> It would be a mess to load all the content in the response
[15:28:01] <RobW> http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/
[15:29:23] <reed> amazing!
[15:30:18] <reed> Hey Queriers, I want to write a jQuery Style Guide for my team, anyone have any good resources to begin?
[15:35:04] <chovy> does anyone have a good pattern for defining a library that requires jQuery to be loaded? I am adding jQuery to the dom myself.
[15:36:59] <chovy> https://gist.github.com/chovy/14f206cf573082f396b9
[15:37:20] <chovy> i need to refactor this so the 2nd half of this code doesn't run until jquery is loaded.
[15:41:22] <koneko> chovy, is it a good idea to put URLs to jQuery in the script? Other than that, I think you can listen for a load event in the <script> tag you'll add and run the library-adding function from there.
[15:42:29] <chovy> koneko: so i should wrap my LIB in a function and call that on load?
[15:43:11] <koneko> Yeah, I guess it's an option
[15:43:45] <chovy> i'm using a bookmarklet so i have to add jQuery dynamically.
[15:44:22] <koneko> Will you use a CDN or will the file be local?
[15:44:46] <koneko> You could also append a small snippet to the end of the jquery.js file that tirggers the library loader
[15:45:36] <koneko> or paste the library script after the jquery script, the links will be static anyway
[15:54:38] <chovy> koneko: the file is loaded remoteyl.
[15:54:51] <chovy> i'm loading jquery from cdn
[15:56:37] <koneko> Then try the load event approach
[16:16:26] <Puck6633> I have kind of an unusual question. I'm spawning a separate window that I control from the parent window with jQuery, and I want to run some setup code that's aware of the parent window.
[16:17:17] <Puck6633> Right now I'm using $(document, talentWin.document).ready(function() {}) in the parent document where talentWin is a reference to the child window, but for some reason it's being overridden.
[16:18:00] <Puck6633> For example if I change the background color of the document the color changes, but then changes back to the default after a split second. Any ideas why or suggestions on a better way to handle this?
[16:41:21] <spronk> guys, does .hide() stop change events from occurring on the hidden thing?
[16:43:36] <thujone> what is a change event
[16:43:56] <thujone> you can still modify hidden elements however you want
[16:43:57] <spronk> like on('change')
[16:44:05] <spronk> i ahve two radio buttons
[16:44:10] <spronk> if the first one is yes, the second one shows
[16:44:16] <spronk> if the second one is yes, another part of form shows
[16:44:44] <thujone> yeah, so you can't change a radio button that has display: none (i.e., hide()
[16:45:28] <thujone> do the radio buttons share the same form id?
[16:45:33] <spronk> well, on(change) of the first, if it's no, it needs to set the second one to no (which should fire it's change event to hide the form), then hide the second one. unless this isn't possible?
[16:45:37] <spronk> nope
[16:45:45] <spronk> well
[16:45:58] <spronk> there are two sets of yes/no buttons
[16:46:24] <thujone> so if you select yes for the first set, it shows the second set which has a default of no
[16:47:03] <thujone> where does the issue come in
[16:47:28] <thujone> should be able to do it
[16:48:35] <spronk> http://dev.childfund75.org/register
[16:48:40] <spronk> have a look at the 'will you fly.. ' questions
[16:48:46] <spronk> under "Flight Details"
[16:49:22] <spronk> the triggers are all working, except if you have yes, yes, then select no to the first one
[16:49:53] <spronk> i.e. 1 => yes, 2=> yes, 1=> no (closes form), 1=> yes (needs to have 2 set to no)
[16:50:02] <spronk> registerform.js line 23 should be doing this
[16:51:03] <spronk> ohhh hang on
[16:51:06] <spronk> i think i see the issue
[16:51:23] <thujone> ok
[16:51:37] <spronk> trying to set the value of the container to no. instead of the radio button. facepalm
[16:52:00] <spronk> hmm, ok, that makes it even worse
[16:52:42] <spronk> the two radio buttons for yes/no share a name - i assumed i could use $([name=...]).val('No') to set that?
[16:53:19] <spronk> or do i need to find the one with the val, and check it?
[17:44:06] <js_doode> validating small form in jquery. credit card will not show "This field required"
[17:44:47] <js_doode> already included it in rules on js script setting ccard: {required: true} still no go.
[17:44:57] <js_doode> any ideas?
[17:57:52] <RobW> so, I have a $.post() with JSON as the return data type
[17:58:12] <RobW> the data returned is a json string.. and one of the properties is a javascript script...
[17:58:44] <RobW> so the server generates some js and sends it with data... how can I eval this properly? I've tried eval(data.eval) and jQuery.globalEval(data.eval) -- but the element still does not change.
[17:59:16] <RobW> data.eval = string ... $("input[name='somefield']").val('').prev().val('something?');
[18:00:37] <RobW> nevermind
[18:00:43] <RobW> it's .prev().html() since it's a label
[18:00:44] <RobW> oops :}
[18:01:04] <lenswipee> Howdy folks!
[18:45:09] <ronson> is this good code style? http://jsfiddle.net/6hqMV/3/
[18:45:42] <lisa_> Hi just testing to see if my client is working.
[18:46:19] <lisa_> anyone here?

[18:46:38] <lisa_> cool thanks
[18:46:53] <ronson> np
[18:49:19] <lisa_> I was wondering if anyone could help me. If I have a image in a div and I want to change the src of the img to a different image that the user selected how would I do that? I can't change it to a specific src because the user has to click whichever one they choose. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[18:50:33] <ronson> lisa_: I don't understand.  There's a list of thumbnails and one large image?
[18:50:43] <ronson> The user clicks the thumbnail and the large image changes?
[18:51:45] <lisa_> Yes there are 3 image choices and one image hidden in a div as a placeholder and the user clicks the thumbnail and it expands
[18:51:56] <lisa_> ronson: yes
[18:52:16] <ronson> So you can change the image src
[18:52:46] <ronson> $('.placeholderImg').attr('src', 'url')
[18:53:22] <lisa_> ronson: yes but I can't have a specific url because the user has 3 choices
[18:54:55] <lisa_> I have tried: var biggie = $("#currentimage").attr("src").replace(this);
[18:54:56] <lisa_> 		$(biggie).show('slow'); #current image being the hidden image.
[18:56:17] <ronson> jsfiddle it
[18:56:25] <ronson> I have no idea why this would be complex
[18:57:19] <lisa_> I'm sure it's not but I'm totally new to this. I'll fiddle it.

[19:04:11] <reed> lisa_: I like your flavor of language when I don't type my name in! :-D
[19:04:16] <neataroni> does jquery not know what to do with $(this).animate({backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, .9)'}, 200);

[19:05:49] <coldhead> getting bugs fixed is better than sex, allegedly
[19:05:56] <coldhead> no one on IRC will ever be able to confirm that
[19:05:58] <lisa_> Uh totally worth it.
[19:05:59] <coldhead> but rumour has it
[19:06:12] <reed> hahahah coldhead
[19:06:23] <coldhead> neataroni: i believe you need a color plugin to animate background colours
[19:06:38] <ronson> you can animate background colors in CSS though
[19:06:39] <coldhead> neataroni: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[19:07:07] <reed> lisa_: what course?
[19:08:29] <lisa_> It's javascript, jquery . I like it but I am way behind and kind of struggling
[19:09:36] <reed> lisa_: Aye, I would hate to learn both those things at the same time, though I assume most people do
[19:09:55] <reed> Channel: How many of you learned jQuery and JS at the same time?
[19:10:20] <lisa_> It wouldn't be such a big deal but my professor is a douche and will not help at all. totally lazy
[19:11:06] <reed> What's your programming experience otherwise?
[19:11:28] <lisa_> none
[19:11:41] <lisa_> I know some html and css and thats it
[19:11:56] <reed> Also, never let school get in the way of your education - Mark Twain

[19:17:03] <coldhead> obligatory mention http://w3fools.com/
[19:18:06] <reed> coldhead: Thanks, never seen this before
[19:19:15] <coldhead> OH THIS COMET WAS THE ONLY MAN I LOVED
[19:20:17] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all is there a way to catch whats coming back from a form when using $form.submit()
[19:20:36] <coldhead> mfoxdogg|work: AJAX
[19:20:41] <reed> mfoxdogg|work: $.ajax
[19:20:47] <reed> what he said
[19:20:55] <mfoxdogg|work> ok
[19:20:59] <coldhead> you said it better
[19:21:48] <lisa_> reed: I didn't notice before but the reason the css was set to display none was to hide the image until the user clicked the thumbnail. Is there a way to display the image after it's clicked?
[19:22:15] <reed> $('img').show()
[19:23:24] <beancurd> lisa_: if someone hasn't told you before, you can run these commands in your browser console to see the effects in realtime, without having to do the whole, edit .js, save, refresh silliness.
[19:24:03] <tw2113> mmm consoles
[19:24:19] <lisa_> I do actually use that quite a bit for debugging especially. Thank  you though.
[19:24:44] <night567> Hello does anyone know how can i make the textarea that would detect, recognize certain words or words with tags and color them as soon as the word is detected?
[19:25:26] <beancurd> lisa_: winning.
[19:26:00] <lisa_> beancurd: :)
[19:27:41] <reed> night567: 	That sounds pretty complex, how proficient in javascript are you?
[19:28:22] <beancurd> night567: some combination of .change(), match.
[19:28:23] <night567> reed not that good to be honest
[19:28:44] <beancurd> if you want to change the text inside the text area you might have to use a editable div? not sure.
[19:29:10] <night567> yeah thats what probably would work
[19:29:22] <night567> but then there is a problem acting that div like a textarea
[19:29:40] <night567> which means it would not send anything
[19:30:45] <beancurd> you mean using it as an form input? do a .text() on it, then submit that
[19:31:19] <night567> yes using it as a from
[19:31:23] <night567> form*
[19:32:18] <night567> let me make a jsffidle with it
[19:35:19] <beancurd> you could probably repurpose a jquery based syntax highlighter to do this.
[19:35:23] <beancurd> https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Litelighter
[19:35:26] <beancurd> something like that.
[19:38:10] <reed> The MOTD of this channel should be "How do I… wait let me jsfiddle it"
[19:40:39] <night567> i have something like this  but its not working :/ let me check the article http://jsfiddle.net/Zwzgj/
[19:40:46] <night567> beancurd
[19:42:49] <reed> that is a bad ass regex
[19:43:28] <beancurd> i concur.
[19:44:49] <dshap> can someone please explain to me why this returns []?  $("<img id='myImg'><p>hello</p>").find('#myImg')
[19:44:58] <dshap> is it because the HTML is not in the DOM yet?
[19:45:09] <reed> no, it's because find goes down the DOM
[19:45:11] <reed> you want filter
[19:45:32] <dshap> reed: aha!
[19:45:37] <dshap> reed: you da man.  thanks
[19:45:54] <night567> lol
[19:45:57] <night567> yeah
[19:46:00] <reed> :)
[19:46:15] <night567> anyone knows whats the problem
[19:46:23] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[19:46:24] <night567> should highlight those words :/
[19:47:41] <dshap> reed: im planning to use $.filter() to parse out all of the images from a bunch of client-side templates and then append them to the dom with display:none for the purpose of preloading, so that when those templates are ultimately rendered, the images will be ready to go. is that a good idea you think?
[19:47:47] <beancurd> night567: doit() is not defined. says the console.
[19:48:08] <night567> ohh
[19:49:18] <reed> dshap: neat idea! Sounds like a good direction, at least
[19:50:06] <dshap> reed: cool, thx
[19:51:33] <night567> hmm weird its defined in the html..
[19:53:58] <reed> night567: http://jsfiddle.net/Zwzgj/3/
[19:54:19] <reed> night567:  you may love me now.
[19:54:44] <reed> Also, that's some really bad ass javascript for you not knowing javascript very well.
[19:57:12] <night567> reed wow it works !!! i do love you lol thanks so much :)
[19:57:15] <coldhead> isn't english weird? if you said the js was "bad" or "ass" that would be sad
[19:57:22] <coldhead> but "bad ass" is high praise
[19:58:09] <reed> the silliest.
[19:58:56] <night567> lol
[19:59:53] <Vasa> I have a problem which i am not sure how to search help for, i am trying to add a 'live' click event handler by using the function 'on' and it looks like this:$(document).on("mousedown", ".fig,.sqr.mark", function(){ do stuff});  now this approach works alright on pc-based browsers, however in a tablet/any other mobile device browser, whenever an element is clicked it performs some sort of...
[19:59:54] <Vasa> ...weird animation of selecting the whole page, and only then clicking the element, how do i stop this weird behavior ? tried it on an opera mobile browser.
[20:02:26] <coldhead> Vasa: try .on('touchstart mousedown') apparently
[20:02:38] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11332533/jquery-mobile-click-event
[20:02:58] <Vasa> coldhead: do you think i should include jquery mobile
[20:03:08] <coldhead> hopefully not
[20:03:11] <coldhead> that would be overkill
[20:03:23] <coldhead> but apparently touchstart is the mobile equivalent of mousedown
[20:03:43] <Vasa> do you think you have a general idea of what i am talking about?
[20:03:51] <Vasa> hard to show
[20:04:24] <coldhead> it would be simpler just to try that suggested fix instead of agonising about whether i understand you
[20:04:28] <coldhead> it's just adding one word
[20:04:30] <coldhead> it'll work or not
[20:04:31] <Vasa> well the touchstart is accepted as an input however the behavior is exactly the same
[20:04:38] <coldhead> oh dang
[20:04:42] <coldhead> then i'm out of ideas
[20:04:52] <coldhead> i have never done anything for mobile
[20:04:58] <Vasa> me neither :P
[20:04:59] <coldhead> we don't really have mobile devices in my country
[20:05:05] <Vasa> ohhh
[20:05:10] <Vasa> not even tablets?
[20:05:17] <coldhead> maybe a few politicians
[20:05:25] <coldhead> not regular people
[20:05:25] <FishEee> whats wrong with this selector? $("(#contsmeList,#contPOCList):not(.x-hidden) :input:text.email")
[20:05:26] <Vasa> how do you call eachother :P
[20:05:29] <coldhead> no wifi or 3g
[20:05:39] <coldhead> we usually just go visit
[20:05:43] <Vasa> hard life =/
[20:05:59] <FishEee> something to do with the div ID's it works with one but cant get two to work
[20:06:03] <coldhead> FishEee: it's way too complicated and unreadable for a start
[20:06:17] <Vasa> i don't like the : between these two
[20:06:19] <Vasa> i think it should be .
[20:06:26] <Vasa> $("(#contsmeList,#contPOCList).not(.x-hidden)
[20:07:08] <FishEee> pretty sure thats supposed to be a :
[20:07:23] <coldhead> $("#contsmeList, #contPOCList").filter(':not(.x-hidden)').find(":input:text.email")
[20:09:16] <FishEee> coldhead: i will admit that looks better but still not working :(
[20:10:09] <coldhead> you can figure out why more easily now
[20:10:19] <coldhead> console.log($("#contsmeList, #contPOCList"))
[20:10:33] <coldhead> console.log($("#contsmeList, #contPOCList").filter(':not(.x-hidden)'))
[20:10:34] <coldhead> etc
[20:14:06] <coldhead> and i hear the spanish screams of girlfriends in the other room who are not like me
[20:15:10] <coldhead> “You’ve got to be fucking kidding with this bullshit,” the report added.
[20:18:49] <FishEee> coldhead: i did my test wrong.. your first version worked.. thank you
[20:19:06] <coldhead> oh yay
[20:23:06] <tocka> Hi, is anyone still alive?:)
[20:23:33] <wilkinsmc> is there any way to go through a function backwards?
[20:23:45] <wilkinsmc> i have an arrow animation on a path, and i want it to go back the way it came
[20:23:51] <wilkinsmc> but the path it followed was fairly complex
[20:24:00] <wilkinsmc> bunch of timeouts and such
[20:26:15] <coldhead> no wilkinsmc, not in JS
[20:26:26] <coldhead> perl6 has a nice one!
[20:26:29] <coldhead> it's called tardis
[20:27:43] <tocka> Im trying to loop through divs, that the top one would animate down and the bottom one would fadeOut. Here where I am now, been stuck for a while.. http://jsfiddle.net/XWbjW/6/
[20:30:30] <coldhead> tocka: i gotta run to lunch but i'd expect you want the css more like this, no? http://jsfiddle.net/XWbjW/7/
[20:31:28] <tocka> coldhead uhm, not really, I want to show 2 divs at once, the second one would fade out, first one would go to bottom and a new one would fade in.
[20:31:33] <tocka> That was the plan at least
[20:34:06] <MrTrick> ahoyhoy. I'm wondering - is there any way to push request headers into an image request?
[20:35:18] <MrTrick> I'm using $.ajaxSend() to add authentication to all my requests. This is working fine for ajax calls, but I want to set up authenticated access to automatically-generated images.
[20:35:33] <MrTrick> (which means I need to 'sign' the requests properly)
[20:39:06] <FishEee> coldhead:  you still around?
[20:39:08] <wilkinsmc> jquery doesn't have a loop back through backwards?
[20:39:10] <wilkinsmc> shit
[20:39:16] <wilkinsmc> i have so much more work i gotta do
[20:41:08] <wilkinsmc> i'm gonna kille the jquery guy now
[20:41:17] <wilkinsmc> & it's going to be a funny news story
[20:43:29] <wilkinsmc> brb
[20:49:10] <ardeay> sup gents
[21:09:27] <alwayslearning> Can anyone show me an example of Jquery targeting firefox to edit some css
[21:09:43] <alwayslearning> I want to make some css changes but only if the site is being loaded with firefox
[21:19:53] <alwayslearning> Is there a way to load a different stylesheet based on browser?
[21:20:52] <coldhead> lordy
[21:20:56] <madprops> is there a way to find the number of objects of a certain type with a certain attribute?
[21:21:30] <coldhead> alwayslearning: you could figure out the browser using $.browser (in older jQuery)
[21:21:44] <coldhead> and insert a <link> to the stylesheet you need
[21:21:58] <alwayslearning> would 1.8.3 be old enough?
[21:21:59] <coldhead> madprops: when you say objects, do you mean elements?
[21:22:04] <madprops> also, is backbone the simplest library I can get to enable models in my js?
[21:22:10] <coldhead> i can't remember when they dropped it, alwayslearning
[21:22:13] <coldhead> you'd have to try
[21:22:34] <coldhead> madprops: there are even simpler ones but that's a pretty popular choice
[21:22:51] <madprops> coldhead, like custom classes I create, a function with some attributes
[21:22:53] <coldhead> $('a[aids]') selects all <a aids="whatever"></a>
[21:23:19] <coldhead> $('a[aids="watever"]') selects all <a aids="watever"></a>
[21:23:20] <madprops> not actually dom elements
[21:23:27] <coldhead> then i have no idea, sorry
[21:23:31] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[21:23:37] <alwayslearning> @coldhead i know this may come off extremely insensitive but could you show me a quick jsfiddle example i'm close to passing out from tiredness
[21:24:34] <coldhead> insensitive, no, but it's very boring of you
[21:26:34] <coldhead> alwaysaskingotherpeopletodomyworkforme: http://jsfiddle.net/KZfjc/
[21:27:40] <coldhead> madprops: what is a function with some attributes?
[21:27:48] <coldhead> are you talking about searching the javascript environment?
[21:27:51] <coldhead> that way lies madness
[21:28:58] <alwayslearning> thanks @coldhead. You are a true sir in every sense of the word
[21:29:26] <vladikoff> coldhead++
[21:29:33] <coldhead> as in "sir i am going to have to ask you to leave" then
[21:30:47] <alwayslearning> l'chaim!
[21:31:07] <coldhead> that is a beautiiful sentiment
[21:31:16] <coldhead> from a beautiful person
[21:31:24] <coldhead> who i hope dies in his sleep
[21:34:14] <wilkinsmc> so is there really no way to execute a function in reverse?
[21:37:00] <coldhead> wilkinsmc: not in JAVASCRIPT
[21:37:05] <coldhead> nothing to do with jQuery
[21:37:15] <coldhead> javascript debuggers don't support it
[21:37:20] <coldhead> it's very complicated
[21:37:47] <coldhead> if you're not mutating state you can write an inverse function for each of your functions and apply that
[21:37:54] <coldhead> probably
[21:38:02] <coldhead> but it's more likely you are trying to do something insane
[21:38:11] <coldhead> maybe there is an easier way that doesn't require a time machne!
[21:38:15] <coldhead> wouldn't it be nice
[21:41:15] <coldhead> good chat everyone
[21:47:51] <coldhead> god i love PHP
[21:47:55] <coldhead> it's so beautiful
[21:52:01] <tw2113> coldhead, you're talking to yourself again
[21:52:37] <coldhead> i don't mind, i'm good company
[21:52:54] <coldhead> ask anyone
[21:52:56] <coldhead> or ask me
[21:55:16] <wilkinsmc> ya, now that i'm writing it backwards, it'd be hard to pull it off backwards
[21:55:32] <wilkinsmc> i just want the animation to go backwards, but it's so compicated it'd have to be a screen capture playing in reverse
[21:56:53] <coldhead> if you were doing keyframe animations in CSS you could use "alternate" and it would play forwards and then backwards
[21:56:56] <coldhead> easy
[21:57:39] <wilkinsmc> it'd take way too many frames, lol
[21:57:43] <wilkinsmc> just position and rotation
[21:58:07] <coldhead> could use SASS or LESS to generate it for you :\

[22:05:54] * mike_f is having an issue with mutating style sheet properties
[22:06:18] <fat> IS there a verticle type tab, where, it'll only load the tab page if you click on the tab. i dont want it to to load everything when the page is opened, just what tab is opened. Simple verticle tab (http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/nn2Qw/)
[22:06:54] <mike_f> I have some var mapDiv = document.getElementById('main_map');
[22:07:42] <mike_f> And I try mapDiv.style.height; in the console and it tells me 980. I set the value, and question it again, and it hasn't changed.
[22:08:13] <mike_f> I try .setProperty('height', '950'); on it, and again no changes.
[22:09:29] <coldhead> have you considered using jQuery?
[22:10:13] <mike_f> So $('#main_map').(something)
[22:10:27] <coldhead> fat: can't you just use what you have with http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax
[22:10:34] <coldhead> $('#main_map').height(980)
[22:11:22] <mike_f> That doesn't seem to work, either.
[22:12:04] <mike_f> Maybe it's because I have certain css properties set on this div which control width and height.
[22:12:14] <mike_f> I have top, left, bottom, and right all set.
[22:12:35] <mike_f> I don't know if width / height take precedence or something.
[22:13:17] <mike_f> But one might think that if you're trying to change something via javascript, that whatever you are doing would take precedence over what was already there, unless that somehow made some bad logic.
[22:25:39] <innociv> Objects are unordered correct? So if I have {'foo':'bar', 1:2} I can't rely on 'foo' always being the first?
[22:28:39] <mike_f> I find there's not often much you can rely on without testing it. :P
[22:29:01] <tw2113> is it the order they're declared
[22:53:21] <coldhead> mike_f: the positioning and the size should be independent
[22:53:37] <coldhead> have a look at the CSS in your debugger
[22:53:44] <coldhead> see if it's being overriden with an !important somewhere
[23:09:18] <coldhead> am i really all the things that are outside of me
[23:17:12] <coldhead> IT'S WHAT I HOPE FORRRRRRRRRRR WOAH
[23:18:37] <noaXess> morning
[23:19:49] <noaXess> can somebody explain this? dialog with a custom scope: http://jsfiddle.net/thomi_ch/4KgnJ/
[23:21:12] <noaXess> it's this theme, with scope .rudy http://goo.gl/CYqQO
[23:21:51] <coldhead> what is the question?
[23:21:54] <coldhead> this works http://jsfiddle.net/4KgnJ/1/
[23:22:22] <noaXess> coldhead:  the close button is on the right, instead on the left
[23:22:53] <noaXess> does not have to do with the text.. problem with the design.
[23:23:24] <coldhead> oh i'm sorry, i didn't realise
[23:23:32] <coldhead> BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE BUTTON
[23:23:36] <noaXess> the close button is anywhere.. instead of the correct place
[23:23:41] <noaXess> sorry :) coldhead
[23:24:02] <coldhead> the button is on the right in the themeroller link
[23:24:05] <thujone> yes, you are those things
[23:24:07] <noaXess> yes..
[23:24:11] <coldhead> what makes you think it should be left?
[23:24:20] <noaXess> in the jsfiddle, it's left..
[23:24:37] <noaXess> if you download the same theme.. w/o any scope, it works
[23:24:53] <noaXess> but if you define a scope, close button on dialogs are not on the correct place
[23:25:17] <coldhead> ta da? http://jsfiddle.net/4KgnJ/2/
[23:25:32] <noaXess> STOP..
[23:25:38] <coldhead> i am thinking of a number between 1 and pizza
[23:25:40] <noaXess> please.. i explained wrong
[23:25:44] <coldhead> you sure did
[23:25:54] <noaXess> morning ;)
[23:26:01] <noaXess> wait.. lets start from scratch ;)
[23:26:20] <thujone> there's no close button, there's a close icon
[23:26:36] <coldhead> +1
[23:26:54] <noaXess> on this jsfiddle a jquery-ui is used with scope .rudy... if you run, click the enable button, you see that the close button on the dialo is on the left, but it should be on the right: http://jsfiddle.net/thomi_ch/4KgnJ/
[23:26:59] <noaXess> ok close icon
[23:27:09] <noaXess> checkout this screenshot..
[23:27:32] <noaXess> if you go to the origina them http://goo.gl/CYqQO and click the open dialog then all is fine
[23:27:45] <noaXess> if you download the same theme without any scope, it's fine as it should.
[23:27:51] <coldhead> it's on the right for me on that page too
[23:28:07] <noaXess> if you download any theme and define a scope, close ICON is not at the correct place
[23:28:13] <coldhead> the main thing i have learned here is how much i hate jQuery UI
[23:28:18] <coldhead> and gypsies
[23:28:37] <noaXess> coldhead: http://i.imgur.com/EvivGxF.png
[23:28:56] <coldhead> noaXess: http://i.imgur.com/k6nawAi.jpg
[23:29:00] <noaXess> for me on jsfiddle its left.. on theme roller its correct
[23:29:19] <coldhead> so just use themeroller, not jsfiddle
[23:29:25] <coldhead> i don't know anything about scoping
[23:29:31] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:29:40] <thujone> is rudy a theme?
[23:29:44] <noaXess> coldhead: i use jsfiddle to show the problem.. you can do it yourself, locally and get same result
[23:29:53] <thujone> i would get gypsy on her
[23:29:57] <coldhead> i am not downloading jQuery UI
[23:30:02] <coldhead> ain't nobody got time for that
[23:30:04] <noaXess> thujone: it's a scope.. so you can use diferent jquery-ui themes
[23:30:32] <thujone> i guess technically it's a scope, yeah
[23:31:04] <thujone> it's some css conflict
[23:31:16] <coldhead> http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/9264273/2/stock-photo-9264273-periscope.jpg
[23:31:38] <thujone> inspect the bar at the top and see what other css rules are being applied to the x icon and its container
[23:31:38] <coldhead> someone in my dictionary's up to no good
[23:32:17] <thujone> that's a better scope
[23:32:45] <thujone> you might not be able to figure out the conflict, so just use css to fix the placement
[23:34:50] <noaXess> thujone: yeah.. thats also my idea...
[23:35:49] <coldhead> that's the fix i already provided for you :D
[23:38:57] <fat> How do you disable the scroll in my streams table? http://www.lolplanet.net/streams.php
[23:39:51] <coldhead> unplug the mouse?
[23:41:06] <coldhead> .new-tab {overflow: hidden;}
[23:49:53] <noaXess> strange, the original them works, same them with a scope doesnt work.. theme reoller bug?
[23:49:58] <noaXess> theme roller ^
[23:50:39] <coldhead> or maybe you're using scopes wrong?
[23:55:45] <noaXess> coldhead: no.. used it since years.. and needed to upgrade to latest jquery and also ui..
[23:56:03] <noaXess> some css won't used if using scopes.. grr
