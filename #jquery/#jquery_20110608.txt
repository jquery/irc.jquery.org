[00:08:08] <balr0g> hello, can anybody help with this kind of issue: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/getjson-character-encoding ?? i have JSON with utf8 chars, when rendered shows strange chars, please help
[00:10:19] <slavka`1> hey guys... does .clone clone the events that are attached to elements?
[00:11:31] <coldhead> balr0g: your server is probably sending the wrong header
[00:13:21] <coldhead> i rely on nlogax for unicode expertise but he is not on the channel
[00:13:34] <JKarsrud> :'(
[00:13:57] <blackspotwiggins> hey coldhead
[00:14:22] <coldhead> hi there BSW
[00:14:31] <coldhead> how's every little thing?
[00:15:00] <thinkfast> urgh
[00:15:01] <thinkfast> http://pastie.org/private/dr3lxlp452xoyjiemzupxg
[00:15:15] <thinkfast> how would i access the 5th key of this object?
[00:15:21] <thinkfast> object.5 dosnt work
[00:16:05] <coldhead> can you paste the actual object literal? what yo have there is not an object
[00:16:11] <blackspotwiggins> pretty good
[00:16:14] <kwaak> Hi, is is correct than when i'm using jQuery mobile framework, and I'm loading a second page (letting the framework handle it via Ajax) any <script> tags on the loaded page are not executed?
[00:16:31] <JKarsrud> thinkfast: object["5"] ?
[00:16:50] <coldhead> that is sadly true, kwaak
[00:17:01] <JKarsrud> but I don't think keys can start with numbers, really?
[00:17:05] <JKarsrud> Never remember
[00:17:23] <thinkfast> ah that was it
[00:17:30] <JKarsrud> okay, that's not a problem, but use object["5"]
[00:17:52] <thinkfast> sorry, used to php :P didnt click to access the property of an object as i normally would an array
[00:17:58] <coldhead> JKarsrud better get a co-author credit for his work here, thinkfast
[00:18:32] <JKarsrud> hah
[00:19:17] <kwaak> coldhead: any workaround or pattern that would still allow me to seperate my JS per page while using JQM ?
[00:21:03] <coldhead> kwaak: i believe wookiehangover found a workaround in the docs but i can't remember it
[00:21:11] <coldhead> the general advice seems to be read the entire docs :\
[00:21:42] <kwaak> coldhead: Alright, ill take a peak. Thanks

[00:25:52] <eckko> hey guys, I am new to jquery but i was wondering if how I can make the radio buttons in the second link, select.php, when clicked, load a page within the first link, admin.phphttp://pastebin.com/H0ufiMnp , http://pastebin.com/hveB7wPg
[00:28:58] <disappearedng> Anyone know why I can't just render another website in an iframe?
[00:30:28] <disappearedng> cross domain content to be specific
[00:35:12] <Morkel> is it possible to put this two https://gist.github.com/1013969 commands together?
[00:36:41] <ablomen> Morkel, you mean this >> https://gist.github.com/1013972 ?
[00:37:08] <Morkel> ablomen: thank you
[00:37:31] <ablomen> also, i think you are trying to stop the link from going to another page?
[00:38:16] <eckko> hey guys, I am new to jquery but i was wondering if how I can make the radio buttons in the second link, select.php, when clicked, load a page within the first link, admin.phphttp://pastebin.com/H0ufiMnp , http://pastebin.com/hveB7wPg
[00:39:01] <Morkel> ablomen: yes when JS is activated i open a dialog if not the user is redirected to a normal web form
[00:41:16] <ablomen> Morkel, ok then use .click(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); yourOtherstuff(); }); << then you don't have to change the href of the element, it will just prevent the default action from happening and instead do what you want it to do
[00:43:10] <Morkel> ablomen: This works greate, thank you
[00:56:44] <Skola> what things are worth caching in jQuery projects?
[00:56:51] <Skola> I mean in vars
[00:57:23] <Skola> I see john resig cache a _lot_ in his code for Khan academy
[00:58:53] <JKarsrud> Skola: cache basically every selector you can
[00:59:41] <Skola> and how about numbers and strings?
[00:59:57] <Skola> John does that too for a lot of values
[01:00:05] <Skola> but this might be more for clarity?
[01:00:24] <JKarsrud> like how? assigning them to vars?
[01:00:31] <Skola> yes
[01:00:41] <Skola> instead of as magic numbers
[01:00:51] <JKarsrud> both I guess, but variables are just easier to keep track of too :)
[01:03:00] <Skola> what if I have some values to read from the document at document ready?
[01:03:12] <Skola> like the width of specific DOM elements
[01:03:50] <Skola> should I make it an object?
[01:05:03] <ablomen> Skola, if you are going to use the values more then once, its going to be faster to cache them, yes
[01:05:41] <Skola> ok, and I use some of them in different events as well
[01:06:13] <Skola> but it feels sloppy just putting a bunch of var x = $(selector) at the top of my $.ready
[01:07:41] <ablomen> Skola, imho it actually makes the code clearer, if you for instance always use $'s in front of cached jQuery objects (so $header = $("#header"), $footer = $("#footer"); etc) you should end up with pretty readable code
[01:08:04] <johanhar> Hi. Does anyone see a way I can optimize this code ? (to shorten it - I have many autocomplete fields with that same code repeating): http://pastebin.com/7mqSRR4w
[01:08:28] <Skola> yeah I do ablomen
[01:08:38] <Skola> but it's sort of mixed with width's and so on
[01:08:49] <johanhar> The difference is only source: where I call getAddresses (ajax request) with different parameters for each autocomplete
[01:09:09] <Skola> I could do var $wrapper = $('#wrapper'), $wrapperWidth = $wrapper.width() I guess
[01:09:18] <ablomen> Skola, just put them in a order that seems right, or put all the widths in a widths object etc, whatever makes it better
[01:09:34] <ablomen> well i would not put a $ in front of the width, since this is not a jQuery object
[01:09:35] <CKIDOW> @johanhar: try this: http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307520543&sr=8-1
[01:09:38] <ablomen> just an int
[01:09:43] <Skola> yeah I know
[01:09:44] <CKIDOW> it really helped me a lot
[01:10:08] <Skola> I now do it without the $ for non jQuery objects
[01:10:21] <Skola> it's still a bit fugly though
[01:10:26] <johanhar> CKIDOW, thanks, will look at it ..
[01:10:28] <johanhar> :)
[01:10:50] <CKIDOW> @johanhar: instead of removeClass and addClass I recommend "http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/"
[01:11:06] <johanhar> Ok thanks
[01:11:58] <Skola> I thought about using a module pattern for the cached stuff, but might be overcomplicating things
[01:14:58] <ablomen> Skola, well most of the time you wont need to have global access to those vars and objects, if you just put different functionality in closures you can just use normal variables and put the few things you do need in multiple scripts (like the window's width or something) in a global object
[01:15:50] <MACscr> been awhile since i have done much jquery work. How can i simply get the value of user-data-id. Right now when i do console.log(data_user_id), i get more than im needing. Here is the snippet to grab the data: var user_data_id = $(this).closest('tr[user-data-id]');
[01:16:05] <Skola> yeah a global object is probably nicest
[01:17:36] <ablomen> Skola, the module pattern is only really useful imho when you are building a big framework, with a lot of re-used functionality, or maybe a fully js based web[site/app]
[01:17:50] <Skola> it's basically for a caroussel, I might be better off making it a plugin
[01:18:02] <ablomen> yeah
[01:22:28] <Skola> but it's a pretty custom carrousel(*), I don't know if it's worth generalizing
[01:24:54] <MACscr> nvm, user_data_id.attr('user-data-id'); worked
[01:26:24] <ablomen> Skola, it's not a lot of work, and you will always be able to put it in another site, it should be worth the small amount of effort
[01:27:26] <Skola> you're right
[01:28:05] <Skola> and it seperates the carrousel functionality nicely from the ajax calls etc
[01:28:27] <koichirose> Hello - how do I get json values from indexed-based keys? some code: http://pastie.org/2036535
[01:29:01] <ablomen> koichirose, it's not an array, its an object, so there is no "first" keyt
[01:29:44] <koichirose> ablomen: right. is there a way to solve this? I'm getting data from the server and the keys have different names, but I always want the "first one"
[01:30:05] <MACscr> how about this one. I have a table row with the custom attribute of user-log-id that is hidden by default with css. Shouldnt something like this when activated show it? $('tr[user-log-id=user_data_id]').slideToggle('fast');
[01:30:21] <aditsu> hi, how can I make some custom tooltips with jquery? it seems there's nothing in jquery or jquery-ui, but dozens of plugins on the net; I just want something fairly simple and reliable, and it needs to work with custom html
[01:30:28] <MACscr> btw, user_data_id is a var that is already designated earlier in the script
[01:31:01] <ablomen> koichirose, then you should use an array
[01:31:19] <coldhead> you people are like obsessed with jquery
[01:31:53] <_W_> coldhead, it's almost as if it was a channel entirely /about/ jquery
[01:32:10] <ablomen> koichirose, or, if you really want an object, you could use var firstKey; for (firstKey in yourObj) { break; } alert(firstKey);
[01:32:48] <ablomen> koichirose, though i don't see a usecase where that is useful
[01:32:54] <koichirose> ablomen: will try. anyway, for my own experience, can't I do something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Gta8U/
[01:33:24] <koichirose> I don't know the exact syntax of course, I'm just wondering
[01:33:24] <ablomen> koichirose, you can use yourObj[yourKey]
[01:33:53] <ablomen> where yourKey is a variable
[01:34:18] <koichirose> awesome, thanks
[01:35:37] <SpecialEmily> how would I go about executing a GET ajax with jquery? I don't really care about the responce, I just want to "poke" the url with some parameters basically
[01:36:44] <ablomen> SpecialEmily, $.get("someurl.php", {"foo": "bar"});
[01:36:58] <SpecialEmily> cool beans
[01:37:59] <ravenzz> ?get @ SpecialEmily
[01:37:59] <bot-t> SpecialEmily, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

[01:38:22] <ravenzz> sorry
[01:38:40] <SpecialEmily> ok, so I should use $.ajax ?
[01:39:14] <ravenzz> yep
[01:39:19] <ravenzz> o the short $.get()
[01:39:48] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[01:45:22] <MACscr> pretty please? I know im doing something wrong thats basic. It works fine with static content for the user-log-id value, but not when im trying to use a variable like so: $('tr[user-log-id="+user_data_id+"]').slideToggle('slow');
[01:51:49] <ablomen> MACscr, what you pasted earlier user_data_id held a jquery object, not a string/int
[01:52:39] <johanhar> What would I like to look up, if I want to do something everytime a <input> is deselected,that is, it had focus, but when it lose that focus (maybe a new input is clicked) I want to do something :)
[01:52:46] <johanhar> Just a keyword to google :)
[01:52:52] <MACscr> ablomen: i fixed that already, its a string now
[01:53:11] <ablomen> MACscr, ah wait your mixing quotes
[01:53:32] <ablomen> johanhar, blur
[01:53:38] <MACscr> ablomen: and it should be what instead?
[01:53:39] <johanhar> thanks you ablomen :)
[01:53:51] <ablomen> MACscr, either use both 's or "s
[01:54:10] <ablomen> MACscr, in the selector
[01:54:22] <MACscr> ablomen: sweet, that was it
[01:54:26] <MACscr> simple enough. Thanks!

[02:01:10] <johanhar> Hi. I had a autocomplete "setup" to a <input>. Later on, "connecting" .blur() to a different <input>, is it possible to ask for that firt's <input> .ui? I had some data there, value, label, and id, if I could do something like $("#firstInput").ui.item.id ? Tho that didnt work, but I feel I am close :)
[02:01:30] <johanhar> Sorry my bad english..
[02:04:34] <johanhar> It didnt work with .data() :(

[02:32:46] <johanhar> Hi, if I have a var test. Can I make a new var testArray = { test: test } ? Will the left side be the key, and rightside the var "test" - or will I get some trouble here?
[02:33:36] <johanhar> I tried toalert that testArray, but "object" is all it say, how can I var_dump or print_r (as in php)

[03:26:03] <argor> hi guys
[03:26:07] <argor> a very silly question
[03:26:30] <argor> how can I pass to the click() function the dom node from which it has been invoked?
[03:26:33] <ablomen> Avorin, afaik you can't, i think you have to do something like bind click/focus/whatever on the window when that input is focused, then that event is on the item that caused the input to loose focus, though there might be a better way
[03:27:55] <js[fn]> argor: iirc "this" will be a reference to the clicked dom object within the click function
[03:28:40] <coconutz> any1 success to put jquery 1.5 to drupal 6?
[03:29:08] <argor> js[fn], ok right, but this returns me the whole document and not the dom node
[03:30:49] <Avorin> ablomen, i achieved this bevahiour with an handler on "html" but this is pretty silly...
[03:32:41] <js[fn]> argor: It will be outside of the function but inside of .click(function() { } "$(this)" will be a ref to the clicked object
[03:33:33] <ablomen> Avorin, i agree, but the event object does not seem to hold any info on the newly focused el, so i don't think there is a much better option
[03:34:01] <Avorin> ablomen, ok, thank you :)
[03:34:49] <argor> js[fn], ok but the handler function is defined elsewhere. Is there a way to access the node in this case?
[03:37:58] <nwillems> Hi there. A nice to have in the documentation(http://api.jquery.com) would be return value/type. Fx. when using jQuery.addCLass( String ) then it would state that a jquery object is returned equal to the one the method was called on.
[03:39:49] <js[fn]> argor: $(this) still references the clicked entity in a handler function
[03:40:10] <js[fn]> You don't need to pass it from the binding
[03:40:39] <argor> hmm maybe I understood where the problem is
[03:42:33] <argor> nope still doesn't work (I'll try some brute force)

[03:58:22] <JKarsrud> koichirose: or maybe #more_products is an a?
[03:58:30] <koichirose> xec: that very well may be :) i'll switch to live
[03:59:11] <xec> koichirose: or wrap it in a document ready event
[03:59:13] <koichirose> JKarsrud: it is, but I'm preventing default
[03:59:23] <JKarsrud> okay :)
[03:59:42] <JKarsrud> are you doing it after the document is loaded tho?
[03:59:44] <koichirose> xec: you were right though. that link was being loaded via ajax
[04:00:06] <xec> woo
[04:00:14] <JKarsrud> koichirose: then you'd need to rebind the click event or use live() or delegate()
[04:00:16] <JKarsrud> ?live
[04:00:17] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:00:19] <JKarsrud> ?delegate
[04:00:19] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:00:32] <koichirose> JKarsrud: yes, I'm inside document.ready. I was simply loading that link via ajax. yep, using live() now
[04:00:38] <koichirose> i feel stupid :D
[04:01:03] <xec> koichirose: if only someone would have bet against me
[04:01:03] <JKarsrud> heh, been there done that before too, so :)
[04:01:06] <JKarsrud> Not lately tho
[04:01:22] <xec> i want my ten bucks
[04:01:24] <xec> :D
[04:01:27] <koichirose> ehehe
[04:01:36] <JKarsrud> haha :D
[04:01:36] <JamesGorrie> No one on the Plugin namespacing function calling?
[04:01:59] <koichirose> JamesGorrie: you can see what kind of issues I'm having, so I'm no help with that :D sorry
[04:02:18] <JamesGorrie> koichirose: Yea, it is a tricky one...
[04:02:24] <JamesGorrie> ;)
[04:03:26] <JKarsrud> wouldn't this.functionName work inside the plugin?
[04:04:50] <JamesGorrie> Nope
[04:05:08] <JKarsrud> hm
[04:05:08] <JamesGorrie> They use a different style of  namespacing
[04:05:27] <JKarsrud> can you show me an example, I'm a bit rusty on plugin development atm
[04:05:34] <JamesGorrie> http://jsfiddle.net/PT6yQ/2/
[04:05:56] <JamesGorrie> I've updated the plugin to use methods.supported, and that seems to work. Good old JavaScript scope
[04:06:18] <JKarsrud> oh right
[04:07:22] <JamesGorrie> JKarsrud: Silly me. Should have tried that a while ago

[04:44:10] <Fernandos> hi
[04:45:57] <Fernandos> I'm trying to renumerize the input name and id of sortable items, but somehow it's not replacing the numbers.. any idea? here is the minimal example: http://fiddle.jshell.net/hWrAE/18/show/light/ and here you can edit the stuff: http://jsfiddle.net/hWrAE/18/
[04:52:31] <opp> So, is there a way to deal with stack overflow errors for jquery?
[04:53:01] <Fernandos> opp: can you name an example?
[04:53:27] <opp> Just random stack overflow errors, mostly on ie8 and lower and ff4
[04:53:48] <opp> Can't even troubleshoot it well, but it's definitely happenning to many users
[04:55:18] <Fernandos> it's  better you work with an uncompressed jquery version
[04:55:29] <Fernandos> it's easier to troubleshoot that way
[04:55:42] <opp> It's just not happenning to any of the developers
[04:56:04] <opp> But users with various browsers and system do complain a lot
[04:56:06] <Fernandos> I've not had a stackoverflow yet..
[04:56:30] <Fernandos> hmm k.. have no old browser to test here
[04:56:41] <opp> What can this be? Too many images on the page? User's PC is weak? Or some plugins causing this?
[04:57:17] <Fernandos> could be all of the points.. depends on your scripts actually. can't  tell more without data
[04:57:30] <opp> Yeah, I know, thanks anyway.
[04:57:44] <opp> Thought someone faced it before
[04:57:51] <Fernandos> are you doing many dom operation simulatnously?
[04:58:33] <opp> Yes.
[04:58:40] <macheleon> More of an editor question rather than specific jquery, but there's no channel for this: I need to do a find/replace on multiple word sets within the same document. For example, say I want to rename a bunch of variables to a new set of variables in one operation
[04:59:14] <macheleon> windows, currently using notepad++ but I'll use whatever I need for this operation
[04:59:24] <Fernandos> opp: that stackoverflow should only happen then if you work with a massive amount od dom operations.. because I'm sure that you're using a wrong accessor that causes this
[04:59:27] <mongag> Can anyone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/YHfJG/ issue. I can't figure out how to fetch the text of span element with a plugin I made
[04:59:45] <macheleon> *new set of variable 'names' that is
[04:59:50] <opp> Ok, I'll keep diggin, thank you
[05:00:16] <phrearch> hello
[05:00:28] <phrearch> i wonder what the css class is of the mouse selection rectangle in .ui-selectable
[05:00:38] <Fernandos> opp: you should try to use .val() more often than nested functions and callbacks..
[05:01:06] <Fernandos> opp: by the way could you take a look at my function?
[05:01:45] <Fernandos> phrearch: can you show what you mean?
[05:01:59] <Fernandos> phrearch: I guess there is a demo on jqueryui.com
[05:02:03] <opp> Sure, what is it? I'm not very good at this though
[05:02:15] <Fernandos> I'm trying to renumerize the input name and id of sortable items, but somehow it's not replacing the numbers.. any idea? here is the minimal example: http://fiddle.jshell.net/hWrAE/18/show/light/ and here you can edit the stuff: http://jsfiddle.net/hWrAE/18/
[05:02:43] <phrearch> Fernandos: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[05:02:52] <phrearch> when you drag the mouse, it paints a rectangular selection area
[05:02:58] <phrearch> i wonder if thats themeable as well
[05:03:17] <Fernandos> listChanger() should take all renumerize the name and id attributes of the input and select fields. starting from 0
[05:04:05] <Fernandos> phrearch: yes. ui-selectable
[05:04:17] <Fernandos> eh sorry ui-selecting
[05:04:39] <phrearch> Fernandos: isnt ui-selecting specifying the items that are being selected only?
[05:05:34] <Fernandos> hmm true.. it is
[05:10:58] <mongag> Anyone ?
[05:12:02] <phrearch> Fernandos: found it => .ui-selectable-helper
[05:12:07] <Fernandos> phrearch: yep found it too :)
[05:12:26] <Fernandos> appears when you select it in the dom then gets removed
[05:14:10] <phrearch> yea

[05:23:03] <seutje> Carraway: ^
[05:23:12] <Carraway> yup yup! thanks seutje
[05:24:22] <seutje> Carraway: https://gist.github.com/366184 is slightly better as it doesn't load the script when it's not necessary, but does impose a dependency on jQuery
[05:25:23] <seutje> Carraway: also, https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills is a useful resource for these types of things
[05:25:35] <timing> seutje: I used to, but people around me gave up trying
[05:25:44] <MickeySoFine> hi all
[05:25:47] <timing> no improvement :-)
[05:26:15] <seutje> timing: so u used to have more random outbursts of weird questions?
[05:26:42] <alaing> hi i need help with jquery ui datepicker. does any one know if I can use a regular expression for the date picker or have multiple date formats
[05:27:18] <alaing> I LOVE INTEL
[05:27:35] <MickeySoFine> I'm trying to make a slider were you can drag multiple handles left or right
[05:27:51] <MickeySoFine> but the slider remains the same lnght
[05:28:17] <seutje> alaing: prolly gonna have to formatDate() urself
[05:28:32] <MickeySoFine> when I drag the handle FF interupts the drag by making the hangle detact from the page
[05:28:55] <MickeySoFine> how can i stop that happening?
[05:28:57] <alaing> seutje: would this constrain the users input/
[05:29:11] <seutje> suppose not
[05:29:20] <seutje> just reformat it beforeShow
[05:29:51] <timing> seutje: yeah still have :-)
[05:30:09] <timing> pif: but I replied to pif!
[05:30:12] <timing> seutje: ^
[05:30:50] <seutje> timing: oh wow, didn't even see that
[05:31:23] <alaing> seutje: how do i constrain their text? At the moment it does but I'm using dateFormat: "dd/mm/yy" and it seems to contrain it by default
[05:32:14] <seutje> pif: beautyTips is generally regarded as a rather crummy plugin, not to mention it hasn't been maintained for over 2 years...
[05:32:52] <alaing> pif: try qTips
[05:33:19] <pif> ok, but a lot of other straight stuff no longer work as well, lemme check
[05:33:25] <alaing> seutje: yeah I agree crummy plugin
[05:33:36] <pif> so qtips is good?
[05:33:45] <seutje> alaing: not sure what u mean
[05:33:55] <alaing> qtips is sweet unless you can wait for jquery ui 1.9
[05:33:57] <seutje> u want to constrain their input without specifying what to contrain it to?
[05:34:14] <alaing> seutje: on what subject tooltips of datepicker?
[05:34:15] <pif> ui 1.9 will have tips?
[05:34:25] <pif> cool
[05:34:40] <mongag> seutje, I know that but for some reason it doesn't work. Please take a look here http://jsfiddle.net/CwXmk/
[05:34:44] <seutje> alaing: on what subject were u yapping about constraining input?

[05:36:29] <mongag> seutje: I forgot about that. Thanks
[05:37:21] <alaing> seutje: by contrain i mean when they type it does nto display invalid characters like in "dd/mm/yy" would not allow you to enter in abcd etc
[05:38:43] <seutje> alaing: but it's doing that, u said u don't want to specify the format, so how are u gonna constrain something without knowing what to constrain it to?
[05:38:56] <seutje> alaing: anyway, that isn't a job for datepicker, but should prolly be abstracted
[05:41:06] <Babbage_> hey :) if you attach a mouseover event to a set of div's when you load a page (i.e. excuse the jquery $(document).ready(.... $('blah').mouseover(function....) and then go on to add more 'blah' div's to your page do you have to re-attach new mouseover events to the new elements or can you account for that at the start?
[05:42:49] <alaing> seutje: ok let me start again......My existing datepicker has is setup as follows $('#somethingSweet').datepicker({dateFormat:"dd/mm/yy"}) this only allows my users to type numeric characters and "/". what I wanted to find out was whether i could allow more than one format like dd.mm.yy or dd-mm-yy so then my users could be able to type numeric characters and/or "." or "-" or "/". regular...
[05:42:51] <alaing> ...expression would be good
[05:43:40] <seutje> alaing: lemme start again: this seems like functionality that shouldn't be handled by datepicker, but by an abstracted lil something

[05:44:36] <alaing> seutje: agreed but I wondered if I could just tap into whatever datepicker was doing to contrain the input
[05:48:03] <Skola> what would be a faster selector: nav#main_nav, or just #main_nav?
[05:48:27] <seutje> Skola: the latter
[05:48:40] <seutje> alaing: not sure, should be, but cba to figure it out
[05:49:33] <Skola> but in the case of nav.main_nav vs .main_nav the former right?
[05:49:33] <_ramo> hi
[05:49:39] <seutje> alaing: maybe https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L578 has some useful information
[05:49:42] <seutje> Skola: si
[05:50:09] <Skola> and how about #banner .main_nav vs nav.main_nav
[05:50:13] <_ramo> how can i realize a textticker in a searchbar ,  something like here www.kaufda.de/Berlin  with jquery?
[05:50:17] <Skola> I mean #banner > .main_nav
[05:50:31] <Skola> contrived example, but just curious
[05:50:38] <seutje> alaing: maybe asplode $.datepicker._possibleChars and slide in ur own
[05:51:07] <seutje> ?tias @ Skola
[05:51:08] <bot-t> Skola, Try It And See
[05:51:24] <seutje> _ramo: how 1990s!
[05:52:04] <_ramo> seutje: it doesn't matter :) but how could i implement this with jquery?
[05:52:07] <_ramo> do you have an idea?
[05:52:22] <seutje> google "jquery ticker" and follow the readme?
[05:53:02] <_ramo> seutje:  hmmm jquery ticker... i can't found an specific plugin for that
[05:53:12] <seutje> ?g jquery ticker
[05:53:14] <bot-t> seutje, ticker | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/ticker
[05:53:20] <Skola> seutje is there a big difference between selector performance in stylesheets and jQuery?
[05:53:29] <seutje> wheelie?
[05:54:09] <seutje> Skola: in modern browsers, it should be exactly the same afaik
[05:54:38] <seutje> actually, might have a teeny tiny bit of overhead in jquery coz it has to init some crap
[05:55:06] <Skola> ya but it doesn't use sizzle right? with elementnames and ID's
[05:56:32] <seutje> shortcuts are made where possible
[05:56:40] <alaing> seutje: how do i do that? in the ui .js?
[05:56:46] <seutje> but it would still init a jquery object, so u get the methods and shit
[05:56:52] <seutje> alaing: no
[05:57:09] <seutje> alaing: anything that's loaded after the picker I suppose
[05:57:14] <t432> how do I get the value of form element with id="name"?
[05:57:23] <seutje> $('#name').val()
[05:57:29] <seutje> ?val @ t432
[05:57:30] <bot-t> t432, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[05:57:33] <alaing> example?
[05:57:34] <t432> thx
[05:58:17] <alaing> $.datepicker._possibleChars = "0123456789/.-"?
[05:58:57] <seutje> alaing: <script src="jquery-ui-with-datepicker.js"><script>(function($) { $.datepicker._possibleChars = function() {}; $('.foo').datepicker(); })(jQuery);</script>
[05:59:02] <seutje> it expects a function
[05:59:50] <seutje> alaing: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L1231 is the original
[06:00:17] <seutje> alaing: normally, it gets passed the format and acts accordingly
[06:00:49] <seutje> but I guess u could slide in ur own format that is independent from the format passed to datepicker
[06:01:18] <alaing> oh i see now that github was excellant help
[06:01:49] <alaing> so if i just copy out the original one and run it after the datecpiker is loaded?
[06:01:58] <mazzachre> When I write my own plugin to jQuery, following the guide in the documentation, starting with a (function( $ ){ ... })(jQuery); and inside make a var methods = { ... }; and then do another one... What happens to these methods? Are they hidden inside the first closure? Or might I overwrite something? Or can I just (inside that closure) save any var I would like and make available through calls to the function I extend jQuery with?
[06:02:04] <seutje> redeclare it, yea
[06:02:28] <seutje> don't just run $.datepicker._possibleChars(); :P
[06:02:53] <seutje> feels kinda nasty redeclaring it though, it being all underscored and shit
[06:02:56] <alaing> copy the original ,edit it and then redeclare it
[06:03:27] <seutje> mazzachre: they will not interfere with variables outside of that closure, no
[06:03:32] <_ramo> thank you seutje i found one :)
[06:03:45] <seutje> but if there was a var methods outside of that closure, it would be asploded inside of it
[06:03:52] <mazzachre> seutje: OK, thx... I have not worked with javascript in ages, and it is somewhat different :D
[06:04:18] <mazzachre> seutje: So I can save all my needed variables inside that parent closure and go with that...
[06:04:28] <seutje> there's 1 occurency where IE will hose ur var all over the place, but don't remember when it occurs, has something to do with lists
[06:04:32] <seutje> err for loops
[06:04:39] <seutje> mazzachre: yesh
[06:04:49] <OldCode101> Is anyone having any success using JQuery to retrieve data from the Yahoo Placefinder API?
[06:05:03] <seutje> ?eval var foo = "foo"; (function() { var foo = "NOT FOO"; })(); foo;
[06:05:04] <bot-t> seutje: "foo"
[06:05:19] <seutje> mazzachre:  ^
[06:05:42] <alaing> seutje: how do i redeclare it? sorry seems like such a noobie question.
[06:05:42] <mazzachre> seutje: So aside from IE I am safe?
[06:05:56] <mazzachre> seutje: Ya, I kinda get that :D thx alot
[06:06:00] <seutje> mazzachre: even in IE, ur safe, it's just 1 freak occurence
[06:06:05] <seutje> but:
[06:06:09] <seutje> ?eval var foo = "foo"; (function() { foo = "NOT FOO"; })(); foo;
[06:06:10] <bot-t> seutje: "NOT FOO"
[06:06:14] <seutje> forget a var and ur fucked
[06:06:44] <mazzachre> ofcause, not adding the var uses the foo from a higher closure...
[06:06:44] <seutje> alaing: $.datepicker._possibleChars = function(format) { /*COAD GOES HERE*/ }
[06:07:19] <seutje> mazzachre: yea, and if u wanna explicitly set something on the global scope, use window.foo = "global foo!"
[06:08:15] <Fernandos> can someone help me fix the numbering in this little snippet? http://jsfiddle.net/e6ear/7/ it cannot find the children..
[06:09:15] <mazzachre> seutje: I do currently... I have build much of the system I am running now using global variables and global functions and I am now at a time when it is so complicated that changing anything, even in my html, breaks something or another :) So I am back to the drawing board to make a more stable version now :D
[06:09:55] <Fernandos> if I enter $("li input".each() it will number each input element, but it should number each li element and replace all input's name attributes ther
[06:10:28] <alaing> seutje: thanks got it working thanks a million.....one pint of beer on its way
[06:10:47] <Fernandos> I tried children() and find("input") but no luck
[06:10:50] <OldCode101> I am making a simple request to YahooAPIs if I access the url directly via browser I get the full json string, if I attempt to get it via jquery it returns a 200 status code with Error and no content, any ideas? (src: http://pastebin.com/u7WPGSDm)
[06:11:23] <OldCode101> test url: http://e-vations.com/lib/jqueryTest.html
[06:12:39] <Skola> seutje I did some reading and
[06:12:58] <Skola> Mozilla CSS Docs say "Donâ€™t qualify Class Rules with tag names"
[06:13:37] <OldCode101> and this may sound odd but can someone hit my test url and verify that they are seeing the error, we are trying to eliminate the ISA server as the culprit
[06:13:45] <Fernandos> aah got it to work :)
[06:13:58] <Fernandos> I forgot to update the 2nd attr() function
[06:16:09] <thinkster> Is there a plugin for font face?
[06:20:56] <t432> Anyone see anything wrong with this statement? $("#show").append($('#itemtype').val() + "<br>");
[06:21:09] <mazzachre> Hmm... another question about events... I have a table with some content, and want to binds some events to different elements in it, I can bind the events to functions inside my methods object, but is "this" the jQuery object of the event, the DOM element of the event or completely seperate?
[06:22:15] <mazzachre> And what is the recomended way to do this?
[06:22:26] <Skola> delegate
[06:22:45] <mazzachre> Skola: huh?
[06:23:02] <Fernandos> can I chain selectors in a find function like this => find("input","select")
[06:23:38] <mazzachre> Fernandos: That does not make much sense... What do you want to do?
[06:23:58] <Fernandos> I want to apply an attribute change to an input and to a select
[06:24:44] <Skola> find("input, select")
[06:24:56] <Fernandos> ahh
[06:25:03] <Fernandos> cool
[06:25:20] <Fernandos> that saves like 5 lines of code now
[06:25:26] <mazzachre> Skola: Uhm, I am quite new to javascript... What is delegation?
[06:25:38] <Skola> delegate is a jQuery function to watch for events
[06:26:41] <Skola> $('#your_table').delegate("td", "click mouseover mouseout", function (e) { // if (e.type === "click") { party(); })
[06:26:49] <Fernandos> Skola: does that work for attr() too? attr('value', newval, 'name', newname) ?
[06:27:15] <Skola> I don't think so, but don't know for sure
[06:28:01] <Fernandos> hmm k
[06:28:53] <Fernandos> hmm the jquery docs says something different..
[06:31:36] <mazzachre> Skola: Well, the thing is... Each row in the table shows part of the information of an array I keep in the closure... So, I have 5 objects in my array, and 5 rows in the table. Each object in the array is indexed by it's unique ID, and when I click a field in the table (designated with class edit) I want to open a dialog that shows more of the object and have fields for editing these fields, when clicking "save" on the dialog I want to extend the origina
[06:31:36] <mazzachre> l kept object with the form data and then submit the result as an ajax call...
[06:32:28] <Angry> Hi there
[06:33:56] <mazzachre> Skola: So, flow of events. I get the full list of objects (init) I draw the table (draw) I attach the events to each edit class element, but how do I know what object I want to edit there... options.table.find('.edit').bind('click', ?);
[06:34:52] <mazzachre> Inside my plugin I keep an Array with each of the objects needed, but how do I get from the click event, to the actual object (I need that to populate the edit form etc...)
[06:35:35] <blamey> hi I read somewhere that there was a tree plugin being developed as part of jqueryUI, but I cannot find this on the jqueryui.com so is this right ?
[06:35:45] <Skola> you need to detect which table-element you clicked?
[06:37:14] <Fernandos> why can't I assign x to that function? varÂ xÂ =Â find("input, select");
[06:37:22] <Angry> Is there a way to pass PHP variables to JQuery without $.ajax ??
[06:37:30] <Woet> .get
[06:37:43] <Fernandos> Angry: when you echo them
[06:37:51] <Angry> Woet what's else ?
[06:37:53] <blamey> Fernandos ?
[06:38:03] <Fernandos> ?
[06:38:26] <blamey> can you re-phrase your question ?
[06:38:28] <Angry> Fernandos What do u mean ?
[06:38:37] <mazzachre> Angry: use "json", in ajax, use JSON.stringify() and in PHP there is a JSON parser and writer
[06:39:12] <computer2000> is it possible to execute php code from within jquery/js?
[06:39:20] <Fernandos> it seem that I cannot assign the find functio to the variable x like thi: varÂ xÂ =Â find("input, select"); and use it later $(this).x.whatever();
[06:39:30] <mazzachre> computer2000: good grief no...
[06:39:48] <mazzachre> computer2000: At least... not that I know of... Why would you want to do that?
[06:40:24] <computer2000> mazzachre: i want to validate a form with jquery and execute drupal php code if it fails
[06:41:00] <computer2000> i want to use the standard drupal error message system but dont want to use drupals form validation
[06:41:21] <mazzachre> computer2000: You use ajax to talk to your drupal backend
[06:41:42] <dschuett> why isn't the easing transition working in this function? - all is working well, i just want to slow the show speed down. http://pastebin.com/DCUTJe7n
[06:41:58] <computer2000> mazzachre: hm do you know of some example? never used ajax with drupal
[06:42:12] <mazzachre> computer2000: I have never used drupal
[06:42:23] <blamey> Fernandos: do var x = $(this).find("input[type=select]"); x.whatever();
[06:42:47] <mazzachre> computer2000: But in all other environments you use jquery in your frontend, and ajax to send form data etc. to your backend...
[06:42:50] <dsdeiz> hi! i have this http://pastebin.com/W2JEYpRF any ideas? :D
[06:43:04] <Rahly> whats type=select? i've never seen that before
[06:43:08] <computer2000> mazzachre: ok thx ill look into it
[06:43:12] <Fernandos> blamey: if I do that it telle me cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[06:43:32] <Rahly> i've heard of find("select"); though
[06:44:23] <blamey> Fernandos:  can you do a test via jsfiddle.net ?
[06:44:32] <Rahly> var x = $(this).find("input, select"); ?
[06:44:54] <Rahly> does he really need a test for a simple selector ?
[06:45:34] <Angry> Woet .get on the page itself ?
[06:45:41] <dsdeiz> anyone? :D
[06:45:52] <blamey> Rahly : are you able to answer "cannot call method 'replace' of undefined"
[06:45:55] <blamey> ?
[06:46:55] <Fernandos> I wasn't able to put the find("input,select") into a variable.. but it's contents http://jsfiddle.net/e6ear/22/
[06:47:31] <Rahly> because x is a jquery object not a string
[06:47:45] <Fernandos> do I need to cast it then?
[06:47:51] <Rahly> you can't
[06:47:58] <Fernandos> hmm ok
[06:48:00] <Rahly> its a jquery object :P
[06:48:23] <Rahly> using input, select, its going to give you many dom objects
[06:48:37] <marcusalmeida_> hi. I've a problems using datatables (jquery). it has a problem in line 58 with message 'a is null'. anyone can help me ?
[06:48:51] <Fernandos> I see, it's not waiting it's calling itself instantly I guess
[06:48:56] <mazzachre> Fernandos: what do you want from it? you could do .val() and save the values of everything (but again, without knowing where it came from, might not be useful :))
[06:49:40] <Fernandos> I just wanted to make the function readable by assiging long functions to a variable...
[06:49:42] <Rahly> should never use .attr('value')
[06:49:47] <Rahly> .val()
[06:49:59] <Fernandos> but now I see that it doesn't make sense except when the value returned is a string or int
[06:50:04] <Rahly> you are raping the .find() function too
[06:50:12] <Fernandos> oof..
[06:50:25] <seutje> Skola: wat?
[06:50:31] <Rahly> $(this).find(x).each(function() { });
[06:50:54] <systemfault> Oh noes! Rape on #jquery, there nowhere safe anymore.
[06:51:18] * Fernandos caught as jquery rapist :/
[06:51:21] <Fernandos> lol
[06:51:31] <dschuett> why isn't the .show speed working in this function? - all is working well, i just want to slow the show speed down. http://pastebin.com/DCUTJe7n
[06:52:07] <seutje> Skola: http://www.componenthouse.com/article-19
[06:52:08] <blamey> ha
[06:54:13] * Fernandos #jquery forgive me sins..
[06:54:25] <Fernandos> *my
[06:55:09] <phrearch> hm, does jquery-ui resizable also support no-wrap resize?
[06:55:29] <phrearch> i would like to make an image inside a contenteditable resizable
[06:56:18] <Fernandos> Rahly: now I get the cannot call method 'replace' of undefined error again, have tried using find without raping jquery http://jsfiddle.net/e6ear/25/
[06:56:48] <toxz> is this possible? http://pastebin.com/d4h5j43p
[06:56:50] <nVee> hey guys. I have a list of url's which is populated from the database. Each url has an identifier, I want when I click on a link that it should change a content area with some pre-completed forms based on the specific url they clicked on. I just need to pass one variable to the content area, how can I do that?
[06:57:25] <Fernandos> toxz: you can do $('.a,.b')
[06:57:48] <Fernandos> or maybe it was $('.a', '.b')
[06:58:42] <Rahly> Fernandos: http://jsfiddle.net/K2PdQ/
[06:59:22] <toxz> Fernandos - thx!
[06:59:30] <Brodingo> fernandos you should be caching $(this) if youre using it that much
[06:59:48] <Fernandos> hmm how do I cache it?
[06:59:48] <Brodingo> also, why are you using i instead of index?
[06:59:54] <Fernandos> toxz: you're welcome :)
[06:59:56] <Brodingo> var $this = $(this);
[07:00:09] <Fernandos> ahh
[07:00:10] <Brodingo> you can pass i to each and it auto increments
[07:00:11] <Rahly> Brodingo: hes doing his own counting loop
[07:00:19] <Brodingo> i can see that
[07:00:20] <Fernandos> I dunno.. I thought index is an object.. wasn't sure
[07:00:35] <Rahly> na its a number... this is the object
[07:00:40] <Brodingo> index is the index of the object in the collection
[07:01:02] <Brodingo> and you only need one var statement per function
[07:02:07] <Rahly> i personally like one line per var, for readability sakes
[07:02:23] <Rahly> a closure compiler should fix that
[07:02:24] <Brodingo> well you can do one line per and still have it comma delimited
[07:02:50] <nVee> how do I get an action a ahref within a table field? <td class="tdclass"><a href="#" class="aclass">CLICK HERE</a></td>? Something like $(".tdclass").(".aclass").click() ?
[07:03:47] <Fernandos> Brodingo: following your recommendition I've no broke it.. http://jsfiddle.net/K2PdQ/2/
[07:03:55] <Fernandos> now not no
[07:03:59] <Brodingo> $('.tdclass .aclass').click(fn); nVee
[07:04:25] <Brodingo> you dont need to increment index it does it automatically
[07:04:51] <Brodingo> and you cached $(this) in the wrong spot, it needs to be inside the each
[07:05:06] <pirolab> hi all
[07:05:33] <nVee> Brodingo: Thank you so much! Let's say my link has a name="" or class="" with a unique value to it, how can I access that particular value (specifically the link the user clicked on)
[07:05:34] <Rahly> Fernandos: he meant like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/AgvSt/
[07:05:58] <Fernandos> ahh!
[07:06:07] <Brodingo> nvee are you talking about the text inside the anchor tag or a attr/prop
[07:06:12] <Fernandos> Thanks so much Rahly and Brodingo!
[07:06:19] <pirolab> I'm working on the last release of pirobox , does anyone want to make some test to understand if there's any bug?
[07:07:31] <nVee> Brodingo: precisely! I have a list of url's, when clicked on, it will change a div's html area, but I need to pass a unique indentifier to that content area based on a name="" or class="" located within the anchor tag
[07:08:11] <nVee> it will give specific content of a speaker, so when a user clicks on the link, the content area will change with information about that speaker
[07:08:29] <silverd> heya guys, anyone here any good with the datatables plugin?
[07:09:10] <Altreus> with jQuery Tools, I want to stop the tooltip from showing but I don't want to stop the mouseenter event from propagating. How do I do this?
[07:09:23] <pirolab> no one is available to make a test on my plugin?
[07:09:41] <Brodingo> nvee lots of way to link nodes, maybe with data-* attributes
[07:10:38] <dschuett>  why isn't the .show speed working in this function? - all is working well, i just want to slow the show speed down. http://pastebin.com/DCUTJe7n
[07:11:03] <pirolab> hey guys is this jquery channel or I made a mistake to join this channel?
[07:11:23] <Brodingo> pirolab this is the official jquery channel
[07:11:32] <dr0id> you made a mistake
[07:11:36] <dr0id> try #mootools
[07:11:41] <dr0id> that's the official jquery channel
[07:12:11] <pirolab> hey droid did u read my question dude?
[07:12:17] * systemfault blames all libs using the $ character
[07:12:30] <pirolab> I'm talking about a jq plugin I'm working on
[07:13:53] <pirolab> however, a really good reception
[07:14:28] <pirolab> thank you all for your willingness
[07:14:39] <toxz> Fernandos - because of you ive made a mistake :-)
[07:15:46] <toxz> how can i select an element with 2 classes? $('.a.b') seems not to work
[07:16:11] <Brodingo> it should
[07:16:30] <pirolab> toxz $('.first_class,.second_class')
[07:16:31] <Fernandos> $(".a.b",".a") I think you want this
[07:16:54] <Fernandos> .. k $(".a.b, .a")
[07:17:06] <toxz> pirolab - but the i get all elements with class a, b, a+b - i only want a+b - am i wrong?
[07:17:37] <pirolab> do you have to associate an evet to that?
[07:17:43] <systemfault> :/
[07:17:44] <pirolab> like a click?
[07:17:54] <systemfault> Basic CSS guys...
[07:17:59] <pirolab> yep
[07:18:01] <Brodingo> toxz your way was correct, paste some code for more help
[07:18:04] <systemfault> You should know that or take the time to learn it.
[07:18:50] <Brodingo> that too
[07:19:02] <pirolab> toxz u get a+b doing $('.a,.b')
[07:19:21] <systemfault> Does he wants all element with a and all with b?
[07:19:27] <systemfault> Or all that have both?
[07:19:50] <silverd> hey all, i am using the datatables plug and within my <thead> I have 2 tr's, first is the table heading and next are the column headings.  Does anyone know of a way I can slot in the function controls inbetween the two using the sDom method?
[07:20:03] <pirolab> right, explain it better toxz
[07:22:21] <toxz> pirolab - Brodingo - this was my example: http://pastebin.com/d4h5j43p
[07:22:27] <toxz> but as you say this should work?
[07:22:41] <pirolab> ok let me see
[07:22:53] <systemfault> toxz: You want to select the first one or the second one?
[07:22:54] <Brodingo> assuming those are valid class names
[07:23:03] <pirolab> $('.a.b').click(...);  incorrect
[07:23:16] <systemfault> .a.b would select the first one.
[07:23:22] <pirolab> yep
[07:23:28] <pirolab> u need a comma
[07:24:16] <systemfault> '.a.b' would select the first one, 'b' the second, 'a' both of them
[07:24:26] <systemfault> Err
[07:24:32] <systemfault> '.b' and '.a'
[07:25:02] <toxz> systemfault> - first one
[07:25:45] <toxz> ok i had .a.b - it wasnt working for me - maybe i had another mistake in it
[07:26:01] <systemfault> It's really .a.b
[07:26:02] <pirolab> toxz what you have to do with it?
[07:26:19] <systemfault> toxz: Make sure there's no space
[07:26:28] <systemfault> '.a .b' won't do the same thing.
[07:26:54] <toxz> i use dynamic classes like idXYZ direction123 and i want to access them directly
[07:27:25] <pirolab> so more then 1 class for 1 object
[07:27:32] <toxz> yes
[07:27:36] <pirolab> ok
[07:27:52] <toxz> $('.dXYZ.direction123').click(...)
[07:27:57] <toxz> $('.idXYZ.direction123').click(...)
[07:28:18] <pirolab> yep right
[07:28:22] <pirolab> got it
[07:28:31] <toxz> mmm have to check it again then
[07:28:39] <toxz> thx so fa
[07:28:39] <toxz> r
[07:28:42] <OldCode101> I am making a simple request to YahooAPIs if I access the url directly via browser I get the full json string, if I attempt to get it via jquery it returns a 200 status code with Error and no content, any ideas? (src: http://pastebin.com/u7WPGSDm)
[07:28:57] <OldCode101> test url: http://e-vations.com/lib/jqueryTest.html
[07:29:12] <OldCode101> and this may sound odd but can someone hit my test url and verify that they are seeing the error, we are trying to eliminate the ISA server as the culprit
[07:29:25] <pirolab> toxz why don't you use just the firt class?
[07:29:42] <pirolab> or maybe make the class as an id
[07:30:25] <toxz> it looks like this <td class="fare faretoggle BUSINESS SAVER flight1S6525E4" style="display: table-cell; ">
[07:31:01] <pirolab> toxz u said that it creats dynamic classes
[07:31:05] <pirolab> right
[07:31:06] <pirolab> ?
[07:31:09] <toxz> jo
[07:31:12] <pirolab> ok
[07:31:24] <toxz> it could be <td class="fare faretoggle ECO SAVER flight1S6525E4">
[07:31:24] <xec> hehe, loving the display: table-cell; on a <td>
[07:31:41] <toxz> its the dev-output from chrome
[07:31:56] <toxz> not my fault ;-)
[07:31:57] <pirolab> the last class is like an unique id right?
[07:31:58] <toxz> "fault"
[07:32:09] <toxz> no
[07:32:22] <pirolab> a ok
[07:32:23] <toxz> nothing's unique there - but its ok
[07:32:32] <toxz> i'll get it work
[07:33:02] <pirolab> so that's your problem, you should try to use id's nto evitate conflict between classes
[07:33:05] <juha____> hmm, i didn't come up with any good css class name, so i named it by a local fried chicken place.. :D
[07:33:28] <toxz> juha____ - bad idea
[07:33:42] <toxz> a dev here names his vars like $fuck
[07:33:49] <toxz> for testing
[07:34:06] <juha____> toxz: awesome
[07:35:28] <Woet> toxz: $insult = $fuck.$you;
[07:35:30] <Woet> like that?
[07:35:47] <systemfault> :/
[07:36:14] <pirolab> wow what a joker we have here
[07:37:22] <juha____> var fuck = {your:function(){return this;},a:function() {return this;},dick:function(){return this;}}
[07:37:31] <juha____> fuck.your.a.dick;
[07:37:41] <juha____> hmm, forgot ()
[07:40:39] <gf3> fuck my a dick?
[07:40:58] <toxz> gf3 - good english
[07:41:03] <Genk1> hello
[07:41:12] <juha____> yes
[07:41:17] <toxz> bye
[07:41:30] <juha____> it didn't go as i planned it in my head :/
[07:41:41] <OldCode101> ha ha never does
[07:42:08] <gf3> use get to omit the ()
[07:43:22] <Genk1> I am using the validate lib for checking form fields.. simply it looks like the validate function .validate() function is only triggered when I submit my form with : .submit
[07:43:50] <gf3> var fuck = { get youre(){ return this }, get a(){ return this }, get dick(){ return 'YA U' } }
[07:43:54] <gf3> juha____ ^
[07:44:07] <gf3> fuck.youre.a.dick // "YA U"
[07:44:23] <Genk1> but what I simply want is doing validation then calling get (ajax)
[07:44:37] <meowsus> Hey, i was wondering if it's a bad idea to have two onload $(function(){}'s on one page - for example, i include an external javascript file that has one and i have a script block on-page that has one.
[07:44:55] <Genk1> how to trigger validate function without using the submit ?
[07:45:02] <systemfault> meowsus: Not at all, it's fine.
[07:45:03] <juha____> gf3: whoaa, all the teaching documentation should be done like this
[07:45:08] <juha____> gf3: thanks
[07:45:13] <gf3> anytime, friend
[07:45:25] <juha____> now, let's swordfight!
[07:45:34] * gf3 whips out his sword
[07:45:35] <gf3> oh wait...
[07:45:50] <juha____> i call mine mr. peepee
[07:45:57] <systemfault> My usual var names for testing are: lol/lulz/roflamo :(
[07:51:44] <Rovanion> How do I get to the valje of the object named title in this two dimentional object array? http://pastebin.com/pmYVePGf
[07:52:20] <systemfault> Rovanion: It's not a 2d array..
[07:52:24] <iszak> nio
[07:52:31] <iszak> it's objects inside an array
[07:52:33] <systemfault> Just an array of objects
[07:52:38] <iszak> array[n].title
[07:52:48] <meowsus> thanks systemfault, i had a feeling
[07:52:49] <iszak> err array[n].name
[07:53:10] <systemfault> meowsus: :)
[07:54:18] <Rovanion> iszak: Can't I something like array['title'].value? Using the name instead of a number?
[07:54:40] <iszak> no
[07:54:54] <iszak> that would be an object inside of an object
[07:55:02] <iszak> ideally
[07:56:40] <Rovanion> iszak: Hm, $().serializeArray(); results in an array. Can I easily convert it into an object? Or can I make an object and then add the data into it?
[07:57:02] <Genk1> this is my example : http://jsfiddle.net/FSSMN/
[07:57:18] <Genk1> I want to submit the data in the forms with ajax get function
[07:57:33] <Genk1> but before that I want to validate the fields
[07:57:47] <Genk1> how can I do that please.. thanks
[07:58:45] <seutje> "Whenever youâ€™re looping through an object received as JSON, youâ€™d better rewrite your JSON and make it return an array" WAT?
[07:59:10] <seutje> how to rewrite JSON when u shouldn't even be writing JSON, ever!
[08:04:43] <Skola> wow @ the performance gain with animations from optimizing selectors and caching
[08:07:48] <pif> how should I convert this line for 1.6.x attr/prop semantics?  $(this).attr('bt-xTitle', $(this).attr('title')).attr('title', '')
[08:07:54] <ThePeach> hi all
[08:07:58] <pif> all prop() ?
[08:09:16] <ThePeach> I'm experiencing some issues with animate() on IE, I've got an absolutely positioned div that is scrolling. I've dumped the values with a step function, and it just skips the first 100 or more pixels... does anybody know how to address this problem?
[08:10:10] <ThePeach> the div is just scrolling horizontally (so changin from left: 48px to -816px) same happens on the opposite direction
[08:10:24] <ThePeach> the rest of the animation is quite smooth, it's just the beginning
[08:11:22] <Skola> try to set left with css('left': '48px') before calling animate()
[08:11:51] <Tidwell> pif: that should still be fine, prop is really only for stuff like disabled, checked, etc - have you run into issues with taht code on 1.6?
[08:12:40] <pif> yes, as $(this).attr('title') is undefined, but prop('title') returns empty
[08:12:52] <pif> so it breaks beautyTips
[08:13:25] <necromancer> i got a beautyTip for ya
[08:13:33] <necromancer> shave yer damn pubes once in a while
[08:13:43] <Tidwell> pif: weird, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the 1.6.1 changes - goes to /read
[08:15:57] <ThePeach> Skola: nothing changes
[08:17:32] <Skola> did you set position: relative; or position: absolute; on it?
[08:17:46] <Tidwell> pif: ahh here we go - list of dom properties (these should all use .prop) https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element#Properties - the bt-xTitle (i assume) is an attribute defined in the markup, so that should probably continue to use .attr
[08:17:49] <ThePeach> it's in position absolute via css, not set via jquery
[08:18:04] <Skola> yeah that's what I mean
[08:18:09] <Skola> could you show me?
[08:18:34] <ThePeach> hard to do right now
[08:19:08] <Skola> does the parent element have relative positioning?
[08:19:27] <ThePeach> it does
[08:19:40] <ThePeach> the animation works absolutely smooth on chrome for instance
[08:20:05] <ThePeach> it's just ie that's really misbehaving, jumping for more than 100px at the beginning of the animation
[08:21:03] <Skola> ;/ IE's a bitch
[08:21:09] <ThePeach> I know
[08:21:24] <Skola> There's a million ways to make it break
[08:21:33] <Skola> so I don't know what it could be in your case
[08:23:06] <ThePeach> it does seem to be something related to some calculation, but's really hard to say
[08:23:29] <Skola> a rounding error perhaps?
[08:23:33] <ThePeach> I didn't really wanted to run through a debugger to find what's the cause of it :P thought there was some "easy fix"
[08:23:43] <ThePeach> that could be as well, who knows
[08:24:00] <Skola> console.dir all your calculation values prior to animating
[08:25:00] <catcatcat> hi, i am new to jquery i am to do something very simple:  can anyone tell why this is not working? http://pastebin.com/RArXABaK
[08:29:27] <plug918> hello, how could i find all the checkbox on the page that has checked in jquery?
[08:29:54] <tfitts> can someone help me with jquery mobile and the datepicker mobile extension? I can't figure this out because it works fine on the desktop versions of chrome, firefox, and safari, but when I pick a date on my iphone it doesn't fill in the date box with the selected date, and if I pick multiple dates then the request url has something like index.php?date=06/06/2011?date=06/05/2011?date=06/02/2011 etc.
[08:30:04] <Fernandos> plug918: $("input:checked")
[08:30:09] <Tidwell> catcatcat: if you console.log toToggle after you assign it, you notice its set to 'post-38 .news-content' - you need to concat a # to the beginning of the selector
[08:30:22] <plug918> great thanks
[08:30:24] <ThePeach> thanks a lot Skola anyway :)
[08:31:06] <Tidwell> catcatcat: so replace this:      var toToggle = id + ' .news-content';     with:      var toToggle = '#' + id + ' .news-content';
[08:32:16] <catcatcat> Tidwell: awsome thanks is working now, another question although i have add "slow" in my toggle function but it is does it very quickly and actually i dont see any sliding
[08:33:06] <Tidwell> catcatcat: you can also give it an exact value, see the docs for .toggle here: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[08:39:06] <catcatcat> Tidwell, thanks, i am not sure what is wrong, it might be my css but it there is no animation in it and it is just closing and opening it like normalr JS!
[08:39:54] <adac> hi guys! How do we replace the content of a selectbox?
[08:45:04] <electissimi> back again
[08:45:23] <electissimi> can't seem to grab the contents of a div after an ajax call
[08:45:23] <Michael> Oh, Thank Heavens!
[08:45:51] <electissimi> http://pastebin.com/FVj9hBb7\
[08:45:56] <electissimi> http://pastebin.com/FVj9hBb7
[08:45:58] <electissimi> my bad
[08:46:30] <electissimi> the " alert($("#pie-stats-div").html());" part doesn't seem to work
[08:46:31] <djQuery> great newest update of chrome causin crashes here
[08:46:54] <electissimi> i've even tried it in .ready()
[08:48:00] <Lest> hi all, i have i select field, with multiple choice selected, is there a simple way with jquery to get the number of choice selected ?
[08:50:00] <Tidwell> Lest: $('select option:selected').length
[08:51:21] <djQuery> electissimi: dude you will have much better luck giving us something like jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com rather than a pastebin.
[08:51:40] <electissimi> djQuery: terribly sorry i'll fix that
[08:51:43] <djQuery> electissimi: also both of those have a javascript checker built into them.
[08:52:08] <djQuery> electissimi: you had an extra comma 'padding':Â 0,
[08:52:24] <Lest> Tidwell: thx a lot, tried few syntax but not this one. Thx
[08:53:02] <electissimi> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/mkYCj/ and i didn't think the extra comma affected it, it still runs..
[08:53:23] <djQuery> electissimi: some browsers would throw a fit. stupid ie
[08:53:47] <DarsVaeda> hi, what's the best method to get a jquery object to json?
[08:54:06] <electissimi> djQuery: ah ok, fixed it thanks, still can't seem to grab the html content of a div after an ajax call has been made..
[08:54:37] <Tidwell> DarsVaeda: JSON.serialize?  maybe i dont understand the question
[08:54:44] <electissimi> djQuery: the alert should show me the content, but it's not even running
[08:55:04] <djQuery> electissimi: still reading. looks like you got a lot going on here
[08:55:05] <Tidwell> DarsVaeda: err sry, thats JSON.stringify
[08:55:21] <DarsVaeda> I fetch all inputs  with $(':input') and then I get an jquery object...and i need to get that into json format
[08:55:50] <fist> hey, im searching for an jquery UI extention which can prompt such messages: http://demo.vaadin.com/sampler#NotificationHumanized
[08:56:00] <electissimi> djQuery: yeah unfortunately i used the ajax method, probably not as effecient as the static method to retrieve all sorts of information
[08:56:04] <djQuery> DarsVaeda: $('form').serializeToArray()
[08:56:35] <Tidwell> DarsVaeda: ^^ what djQuery said
[08:56:36] <djQuery> DarsVaeda: the absolute easiest way would be to use ?see malsup ajaxform
[08:56:37] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, ThickBox 3.1 - http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[08:56:54] <djQuery> ?serializetoarray
[08:56:55] <bot-t> djQuery, .serializeArray() - Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[08:57:23] <hendrixski> Is there a different way you have to build a jQuery plugin so it can be called like this    $.myPlugin("someParam");
[08:57:28] <djQuery> ah yes its serializeArray not serializeToArray
[08:58:19] <djQuery> DarsVaeda: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[08:59:19] <DarsVaeda> yeah thx, got the serializeArray() but that gives not the excpected output
[08:59:53] <djQuery> hendrixski: your best bet would be to look at a few utility function built in and see what they do.
[09:00:27] <DarsVaeda> its just "set[o][name] = foo, set[0][value] = bla" rather than just "foo = bla" :/
[09:01:26] <electissimi> djQuery: if i plug it into the chrome console it returns what i want...however doesn't seem to work on ajax callback
[09:01:52] <djQuery> electissimi: hmmm dont know
[09:02:14] <djQuery> electissimi: whats the window.location.reload() there for?
[09:02:25] <hendrixski> djQuery, Ok, so something like $.ajax()
[09:02:43] <electissimi> djQuery: so after it successfully creates or deletes a character it refreshes the page
[09:02:52] <hendrixski> no tutorials though, right?
[09:03:08] * Fernandos â™¥ jQuery
[09:04:06] <electissimi> hendrixski: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:04:16] <djQuery> hendrixski: .map might be an easier one to start with
[09:04:18] <Fernandos> hendrixski: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[09:04:44] <djQuery> Fernandos: ?jqf
[09:04:45] <Fernandos> it'll appear on http://learn.jquery.com soon hopefully
[09:04:51] <hendrixski> Sweet, thanks I'll look there :-D
[09:04:52] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[09:04:52] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 7 minutes and 57 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: djQuery, .serializeArray() - Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:05:23] <BHSPitMonkey> Novice question: How do you guys find the right plugins for what you're trying to accomplish? There are so many on the site, and with no way to sort by rating or popularity, it's hard to even look.
[09:05:36] <Fernandos> http://plugins.jquery.com
[09:05:41] <electissimi> djQuery: the alert doesn't even seem to work...this is odd
[09:05:44] <BHSPitMonkey> Fernandos: yes, that's what I'm referring to
[09:06:18] <djQuery> electissimi: seems you best bet would be to set a break point and step through it
[09:06:41] <djQuery> BHSPitMonkey: well they are supposedly redoing the plugin page.
[09:07:23] <BHSPitMonkey> djQuery: I suppose the best approach is to just ask the channel for a specific recommendation?
[09:07:53] <djQuery> you can sort it by votes but its kinda lame as the rating is wieghted. so some crap with 1 5 rating comes before something with 3000 votes and a 4.9 rating
[09:08:06] <Narcissus> 2
[09:08:39] <djQuery> BHSPitMonkey: its always best to just searchfirst.
[09:08:41] <DarsVaeda> maybe its very simple, this is what I want to do: http://codepaste.net/cfbg1x
[09:08:44] <electissimi> djQuery: HAHA i figured it out..
[09:08:45] <Fernandos> BHSPitMonkey: first you find a user scenario that you want to solve and imagine how it would be the most effcient and comfortable way for a user to get x done. then you look for a plugin which does a similar thing and compare the plugins you've found for their quality and if they fit to your task.
[09:08:46] <BHSPitMonkey> I'm new to jquery, but my goal is to have multiple tables on a page, and only show one at a time. There would be a way to change which one is being shown, and have some kind of basic transition in between
[09:08:53] <electissimi> djQuery: i feel retarded now
[09:08:55] <hendrixski> and... just to make sure I'm looking for the right thing in these docs... I'm looking for how to create functions that are in the jquery namespace but cannot be called on jquery objects, is that the right terminology for creating a function that can be called as just $.myFunction() ?
[09:09:03] <BHSPitMonkey> djQuery: for what I just described, I have no idea what search terms I would use...
[09:09:05] <djQuery> if you find something and it dont have docs then skip it
[09:09:30] <electissimi> djQuery: if you take a look at it, it was inside the .bind('submit' call
[09:09:33] <Fernandos> BHSPitMonkey: sounds like a wizard or tabbed interface..
[09:10:34] <BHSPitMonkey> Fernandos: basically tabs, yes, but without the tabs. I'd want to use links or a <select> to trigger the change
[09:12:36] <Daemon_> hai hai!
[09:12:41] <Daemon_> pleased to know everyone :)
[09:12:46] <DarsVaeda> can someone tell me how to get the input fields into my ajax call? http://codepaste.net/mdvago
[09:12:55] <Fernandos> you can trigger .show() when a ceterain even has ocurred and .hide() the prior table..
[09:13:15] <djQuery> cc@electissimi
[09:13:15] <Daemon_> may someone give me a hand fixing an accordion menu?
[09:13:44] <cerib> how do i get the html() of a table from $.get('myurlhere.com');
[09:14:01] <djQuery> Daemon_: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/nfbke/
[09:14:36] <cerib> is it possible to get a specific table from a html which was returned by $.get??
[09:15:11] <djQuery> cerib: do you have an id for the table?   $.get('myurlhere.com  #tableid');
[09:15:42] <cerib> yes
[09:15:48] <cerib> thanks i'll try that one
[09:15:54] <djQuery> Daemon_: dont pm me
[09:16:25] <djQuery> cerib: forget if it is get or load or both that accepts that syntax
[09:17:00] <ajpiano> only lload
[09:17:24] <cerib> will it still work even if the #tableid is 3 to 4 levels deep?
[09:18:02] <Daemon_> question: what action should i use to start a javascript when i click on an accordion item element? (using <a> for the menu items, using the ID isn't working)
[09:18:58] <djQuery> Daemon_: is this a ui.accordion?
[09:19:32] <Daemon_> yes
[09:19:39] <djQuery> Daemon_: there ya go
[09:19:39] <Daemon_> @djQuery yes
[09:20:53] <djQuery> $('selector').accordion({change: function(event, ui){ console.log(event, ui); })
[09:21:10] <Daemon_> that all i needed, many thanks :)
[09:21:32] <djQuery> Daemon_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#event-change
[09:21:42] <cerib> djQuery: $.get('myurlhere.com body'); doesn't work
[09:21:48] <cerib> :)
[09:22:22] <djQuery> cerib: turns out that syntax only works with .load
[09:28:50] <logiclord> is there any $.getStyle like $.getScript ??
[09:29:31] <Michael> ? getStyle
[09:29:35] <bot-t> Michael, #4434 (access :hover css properties of an element via jquery ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4434
[09:29:38] <Michael> You could write it :)
[09:29:55] <djQuery> logiclord: http://topsecretproject.finitestatemachine.com/2009/09/how-to-load-javascript-and-css-dynamically-with-jquery/
[09:30:15] <djQuery> logiclord: there is also see ?themeswitcher

[09:30:24] <swiggy> for jquery ui, is is possible to have the options for the autocomplete box - have a different value? ie: you search for/find 'Nick', but instead of it using 'nick' as the textbox value, it will use nick@gmail.com
[09:30:33] <swiggy> i am trying to make an autocomplete of company email address
[09:30:40] <swiggy> and have the user beable to search by user and email
[09:30:53] <swiggy> but only use the email for the value, not the name
[09:31:26] <asti> hello, i've got a little bit weird behaviour of a script in IE9. in that regard i was wondering, - if i have two script tags in the <head>, and the first one is jquery, and the second one refers to a .js file which tries to access the jquery-object using $, is it possible that $ could be undefined at that point in time?
[09:31:50] <djQuery> swiggy: var address = [{'id': 'nick@gmail.com', 'label': 'nick'}, etc.....]
[09:32:04] <djQuery> swiggy: if you have them formated like that it will work
[09:32:16] <swiggy> and whatw ill search the label, but use the ID for the value?
[09:32:25] <logiclord> will try it out thanks
[09:32:47] <swiggy> it will search either the id or the label
[09:32:53] <swiggy> but only use the id for the value
[09:32:53] <electissimi> djQuery: one quick question.. why doesn't this seem to work?
[09:32:54] <djQuery> yes it will search on label and they will see label in the menu but it will put id in the field
[09:33:06] <electissimi> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/fBxZJ/
[09:34:11] <djQuery> electissimi: dont know what u are trying to accomplish
[09:34:21] <richardm_> Hi. With delegate is there any way to get the element I'm delegating to from inside the event handler?
[09:34:29] <electissimi> djQuery: it puts the content of the <div> into variable 'divcontent', and i put that inbetween the brackets for var data, then Flot is supposed to plot it in a pie chart
[09:34:59] <djQuery> electissimi: probably because html just returns a string.
[09:35:30] <djQuery> electissimi: you probably need to loop over the child elements of the div and add them to an array
[09:35:57] <electissimi> djQuery: yeah thats what i thought too, no way to just print it out?
[09:36:11] <djQuery> richardm_: yes it will be accessable as this inside of the funciton
[09:36:11] <orolo> whats the standard way if asking a function if a parameter exists?
[09:36:50] <orolo> function myFunc(one, two) { if (two) {} }
[09:37:10] <orolo> ?
[09:37:16] <djQuery> richardm_: $('div').delegate('a', 'click', function(e){  e.preventDefault(); console.log(this, this.href); });
[09:37:17] <Archaic_G> anyone know how to get audio playing on a blackberry with jq?
[09:37:28] <gnarf> orolo: works if "two" is only gonna be non-false
[09:37:33] <gnarf> you can also if (two !== undefined)
[09:37:34] <nym> good morning
[09:37:42] <tbranyen> Archaic_G: jquery doesn't play audio
[09:37:45] <orolo> gnarf. ok. thanks
[09:38:06] <Archaic_G> well... jplayer plays audio and its based on jquery, no?
[09:38:16] * nym waves to ajpiano and SlexAxton
[09:38:22] <dannymac21> Anyone willing to help out a newbie w/a strange jQuery problem?
[09:38:33] <dannymac21> would really appreciate any help.
[09:38:42] <Archaic_G> dannymac21 just ask your q
[09:38:44] <nym> dannymac21: ask your question
[09:38:52] <djQuery> Archaic_G: there are so many different version of blackberry that its a pain. does the one that you are working with support html 5
[09:38:53] <nym> dannymac21: you don't ask if you can ask on irc
[09:39:12] <djQuery> ?ask@dannymac21
[09:39:13] <bot-t> dannymac21, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:39:26] <dannymac21> i am using validation plugin (v1.8) w/jquery 1.6 .. my code is working fine in FF, but in IE its behaving strangely.
[09:39:44] <ryanneufeld> dannymac21: define strangely
[09:39:45] <nym> define behaving strangely
[09:39:47] <swiggy> djQuery,
[09:39:53] <swiggy> your idea for the autocomplete
[09:40:00] <swiggy> it still uses the name for the actual value
[09:40:03] <swiggy> not the e-mail address
[09:40:04] <Archaic_G> djQuery: so i see, targeting torch & up as I realize older ones have little shot of working. It supports limited html5 from what I can tell, and the audio tag isnt one that it supports
[09:40:09] <sven_oostenbrink> I'm a bit confused about how selectors that return multiple results are processed.. if, for example, I use  $('.test').trigger(); and the selector has 2 results, will the trigger be applied to both items? Also, if I say results = $('.test');  will I have an array with 2 objects in it?
[09:40:24] <dannymac21> the submitHandler fires off (i show an alert to prevent form posting) but none of the errors show up
[09:40:28] <swiggy> i want to be able to search by name, or email - but if a name is chosen - it use the email for that person
[09:40:29] <dannymac21> in FF it runs fine
[09:40:30] <swiggy> not their name
[09:40:35] <ajpiano> sven_oostenbrink, yes, and yes.
[09:40:42] <ajpiano> you'll have a jquery objec,t not an array
[09:41:20] <djQuery> Archaic_G: one of these days browser manufacturers will worry about getting stuff to support standards 1st and be the fastest 2nd
[09:41:26] <dannymac21> i can email a test page if someone is willing to take  a quick look
[09:41:46] <sven_oostenbrink> ajpiano: will I be able to use for(object in results){} then, for example?
[09:41:46] <Archaic_G> djQuery: been hearing that for 10-15years haha
[09:42:01] <djQuery> swiggy: you could do a custom select
[09:42:08] <ajpiano> sven_oostenbrink, you *could* but it's not ideal.  the best way to iterate over a jquery object is to use .each
[09:42:13] <swiggy> explain?
[09:42:20] <sven_oostenbrink> ajpiano: also, if I do console.log(results.length); I should I see "2" for the given example, right?
[09:42:30] <ajpiano> $(".foo").each(function(index, el) {    });
[09:42:31] <sven_oostenbrink> ajpiano: ah, better... will do!
[09:42:33] <ajpiano> yes
[09:42:42] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: for/in is not for arrays, don't do that.
[09:42:44] <sven_oostenbrink> ajpiano: thanks for clearing that up!
[09:43:03] <sven_oostenbrink> systemfault: what is for/in for then?
[09:43:13] <djQuery> swiggy: you could do something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/UsLnM/14/
[09:43:18] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: Iterating over an object's properties.
[09:43:34] <dannymac21> i tried changing charset attr on script tag which i read sometimes works in IE, but no luck still.
[09:43:54] <dannymac21> also tried using uncompressed versions with no effect
[09:43:58] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: For arrays, use either a for loop or .forEach is the browser supports it. With jQuery, just use .each
[09:44:32] <swiggy> woah
[09:44:38] <swiggy> thats way more complex then my current
[09:44:43] <S1kx> what is currently the most popular plugin for jquery (or even jquery-ui) for sortable tables?
[09:44:48] <swiggy> but if we understand eachother write
[09:44:49] <ryanneufeld> dannymac21: are you returning false at the end of your submit handler?
[09:44:50] <swiggy> right*
[09:44:52] <sven_oostenbrink> systemfault: so, just to have it clear, normally for objects I'd use for / in to itterate over its properties, but in jQuery, for multiple results, I use .each()
[09:44:54] <swiggy> yout above script
[09:45:01] <sven_oostenbrink> systemfault: ajpiano: Thanks!
[09:45:06] <djQuery> S1kx: see ?ui.sortable
[09:45:06] <bot-t> S1kx, The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[09:45:08] <ajpiano> ?g isocra jquery tablednd @ S1kx
[09:45:09] <bot-t> S1kx, Table Drag and Drop JQuery plugin | Isocra - http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/
[09:45:12] <swiggy> will allow me to search by name or e-mail, and if the name is selected - it will use the email matching that user?
[09:45:20] <electissimi> djQuery: i can't figure out how to make it not a string lol...
[09:45:25] <swiggy> and if email is chosen, it will use the email
[09:45:26] <ajpiano> S1kx, the one i just linked you to is the only one for sortable table rows that i've used that has actualyl worked
[09:45:33] <electissimi> djQuery sorry for being a pain

[09:46:29] <ajpiano> oh
[09:46:38] <ajpiano> tablesorter does that, but it can be slow on large datasets
[09:46:39] <S1kx> what I see is DataTables but i just wanted to see if there is anything better out there

[09:47:33] <S1kx> thanks guys ;)
[09:47:52] <djQuery> electissimi: why did you ever stick that in a div instead of just in an object in the first place
[09:48:31] <electissimi> djQuery, because i return the div as html through an ajax call, so that the div has all the information i need
[09:48:58] <djQuery> electissimi: why not just return the data as a json object in the ajax call?
[09:49:32] <electissimi> djQuery: don't know how to do that lol
[09:49:51] <djQuery> electissimi: what is the backend that you are using?
[09:50:27] <swiggy> djQuery,  did u see my previous question
[09:50:35] <electissimi> djQuery: my own code, i'm making an ajax call to a custom php page, it returns a bunch of html, and data produced from php code..

[09:59:24] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: No
[09:59:50] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: jQuery's each is a bit... for the lack of better word.. stupid
[09:59:58] <djQuery> swiggy: then it sounds like you will want to use the select event to override what its doing
[10:00:10] <systemfault> sven_oostenbrink: The closure, its first parameter is the index, the second is the element
[10:00:38] <sven_oostenbrink> systemfault: sweet.. :) Anyway, my bad, jumped over the documentation, have it now..
[10:05:01] <meowsus> I have a kind of general question about plugins. If you have a <div id="this-id"> and a plugin with adjustable parameters that selects that div like so, $("#this-id").plugin({blah:"whatever"}), is there a general rule of thumb for getting the selected jQuery object from within the parameters you give to the plugin?
[10:05:48] <meowsus> Like if i wanted to do $("#this-id").plugin({ title:$(this).attr('title') }) and have the selected elements title be added to the title parameter?
[10:07:05] <Raverix> Unfortunately, in that scenario, this is being evaluated in your current scope.
[10:07:13] <Raverix> So that's obviously not going to work.
[10:07:38] <Raverix> Within the plugin, you have a reference to the object.
[10:08:02] <swiggy> so there is no way to do my idea then?
[10:08:10] <swiggy> other than to just use a selectbox insteaD?
[10:08:39] <swiggy> or can i use a selectbox, and its options as the 'source' for my autocomplete?
[10:09:01] <swiggy> and use this.value (ie the email) for the this.text(the name matched) for it
[10:10:46] <amid_hasan> making json is so confusing
[10:10:54] <Raverix> amid_hasan: No it's not.
[10:11:06] <amid_hasan> *json calls
[10:11:07] <Raverix> {key:"value"}
[10:11:17] <amid_hasan> i get {key:"value"}
[10:11:31] <amid_hasan> I dont get how to call remote server, and return the data the way I want it to look
[10:11:32] <Raverix> Which part of the json calls are you finding confusing?
[10:11:45] <Raverix> $.getJSON(url);
[10:13:12] <amid_hasan> Trying to implement the following: do a json call to php script which queries a database to get values based on the parameters from the original call. Returns values which I append to document.
[10:15:46] <Raverix> Also, fairly easy.
[10:15:56] <Raverix> Here's what you'll want to do.
[10:16:05] <amid_hasan> can you please provide how you call the script?
[10:16:17] <Raverix> Run your SQL query, get all your results into a single PHP array, and then echo json_encode($dataArray)
[10:16:45] <Raverix> There's no magic with the call.
[10:17:05] <Raverix> $.getJSON("/whatever/get/data/blah?id=4");
[10:17:10] <Raverix> It's just a url.
[10:17:26] <electissimi> can't i just convert a string to an object?
[10:17:48] <amid_hasan> Raverix: i will try this now
[10:18:00] <taruti> Is the grid branch usable at the moment?
[10:19:19] <Raverix> amid_hasan: Try putting the url directly in your web browser and ensure that the output is valid JSON.
[10:20:04] <amid_hasan> Raverix: on the server script, would I have to pull in $_GET values from the url?
[10:20:07] <_ramo> hi
[10:20:11] <amid_hasan> is that how json works?
[10:20:35] <systemfault> amid_hasan: JSON is a damn string, nothing more, nothing less
[10:21:07] <_ramo> how do i add text to an inputfield?
[10:21:11] <amid_hasan> brb
[10:21:14] <Zerxer> amid_hasan: though yes, if you're using getJSON, any extra data sent would be GET values that you'd grab with $_GET
[10:21:16] <Raverix> amid_hasan: IF you sent GET values, then yes.
[10:21:16] <Raverix> It behaves exactly as if you were requesting that page from your address bar.
[10:21:16] <Raverix> All web rules still apply :)
[10:22:00] <Zerxer> _ramo: $("input:text").val('the text')
[10:22:07] <_ramo> thanks
[10:22:13] <_ramo> i found it in the doku Zerxer
[10:22:35] <Zerxer> atta boy
[10:23:06] <electissimi> does .value() return a string?
[10:23:30] <electissimi> i'd like it to return an object
[10:23:30] <Zerxer> .val() does
[10:23:42] <_ramo> Zerxer: i try to implement a ticke rin an input field
[10:23:46] <Skola> why do you want that
[10:24:00] <electissimi> i'm trying to get it to where i can plot data with Flot
[10:24:13] <_ramo> e.g. if i load a page, in the input field the word "temporary" should be displayed character for character
[10:24:13] <Skola> but you can make an object from the string
[10:24:21] <_ramo> but how can i stop it ?
[10:24:28] <Skola> or parse the string directly
[10:24:39] <electissimi> data must be an array like {label: dsadf, data: 32432}
[10:24:43] <electissimi> inside []
[10:24:45] <Trisox[work]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y7W6BaNs_I&feature=related loool its so fluffy i'm gona dieeee
[10:24:49] <Misiur> Hello
[10:24:50] <Trisox[work]> :)
[10:25:09] <Misiur> I perform $.get on site, the response is 200... but there's no content and firebug higlights is as red
[10:25:10] <electissimi> i tried grabbing the data with .html()
[10:25:10] <Skola> typeof({}) === "object"
[10:25:52] <electissimi> what does that do Skola?
[10:26:02] <Trisox> grabbin what data?
[10:26:10] <Zerxer> it tells you that {} is an object type
[10:26:21] <Trisox> electissimi
[10:26:21] <Skola> electissimi what does val() return?
[10:26:31] <electissimi> a string..
[10:26:35] <Trisox> make a js fiddle
[10:26:36] <Skola> yes I know
[10:26:41] <electissimi> Trisox: ?
[10:26:44] <Zerxer> what is the string
[10:26:51] <Trisox> i wanna help
[10:26:52] <sven_oostenbrink> http://jsfiddle.net/GbTgS/10/  How to do this best with jQuery? I have various divs (dynamically created with clone()) where each one has a number of hidden inputs with data.. Now, I need to send all that data to a php script..  How best to go about that?
[10:26:59] <Skola> what does the string look like?
[10:27:09] <electissimi> "{label: "Hitpoints",  data: 1200},"
[10:27:23] <electissimi> without quotations
[10:27:54] <electissimi> i need to put it into var data = [{label: "Hitpoints",  data: 1200},];
[10:28:05] <Zerxer> sven_oostenbrink: wrap it all in a <form> element, then you can do $("form").serialize(); and your 'data' will be what it needs to be
[10:28:06] <Skola> >>> new Object({label: "Hitpoints", data: 1200})
[10:28:07] <Skola> Object { label="Hitpoints", data=1200}

[10:30:02] <djQuery> Zerxer: he keeps leaving because not enough peeple give him snacks

[10:30:14] <devinrolsen> Ok, I'm stumped. http://pastebin.com/34xp6FDj I'm using a get script to load an external plugin and simply apply it to my document body. But it keeps coming back saying: $("body").layout is not a function

[10:30:24] <Zerxer> ok, figured that'd work
[10:30:25] <Zerxer> but fine
[10:30:27] <Zerxer> ?botsnack
[10:30:27] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[10:30:28] <Zerxer> eat up fatty
[10:30:29] <devinrolsen> but my net tab shows that indeed the script has been fully downloaded prior to getting that error.
[10:30:30] <electissimi> so i could do: divcontent = new Object(string)?
[10:30:45] <systemfault> electissimi: What?
[10:30:46] <sven_oostenbrink> Zerxer: great! thanks a lot!
[10:31:33] <electissimi> systemdefault: i'm trying to parse this string into an object of sorts, so i could make var data = [divcontent];
[10:31:49] <Skola> electissimi why though is the val() of your element already formatted like an object?
[10:32:09] <Skola> and can't you use $.data or the data-something attribute?
[10:32:17] <electissimi> skola: it's not, i'm using .html() right now to get the contents from a div
[10:32:29] <electissimi> .val also returns string though correct?
[10:32:55] <electissimi> I can't use it because it's a string, it needs to be part of the code
[10:33:07] <devinrolsen> anyone else ever have issues with $.getScript successfully gathering the script, but fall flat on its face with you try to use the new methods from the script it just got in its callback?
[10:33:52] <Zerxer> .val returns the string value of an input, not a div. so html/text is what you want there
[10:34:02] <Zerxer> you need to turn that string into an object, it's not that difficult
[10:34:10] <devinrolsen> its weird cause, if I include the script (no useing $.getScript) into my document, I can use its new methods just fine.
[10:34:11] <Skola> electissimi can't you do <div data-label="abc" data-data="12312312">whatever</div>
[10:34:15] <electissimi> how would i do that zerker?
[10:34:39] <Trisox> Skola: wy cant he
[10:34:48] <Trisox> data-data is strange
[10:34:53] <electissimi> Skola: those return strings though when i try grabbing them, right?
[10:34:53] <Zerxer> ?parseJSON
[10:34:54] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:34:55] <Trisox> but data-rule
[10:35:23] <electissimi> it's not JSON though.
[10:35:26] <Skola> then do new Object({label: $(div).attr('data-label'), data: $(div).attr('data-data')}) ?
[10:35:26] <Zerxer> electissimi: if you grab the data attributes with jquery's .data() function, if it's a json-string, jquery will parse it and return a json object
[10:35:27] <Trisox> you can use data-xxx since jquery 1.4.3
[10:35:57] <Skola> what Zerxer says is better
[10:36:08] <Zerxer> electissimi: it's not json?? "{label: "Hitpoints",  data: 1200}" <- how is it not
[10:36:15] <Trisox> electissimi like $('.naam').val ($this.data ('naam'));
[10:36:37] <systemfault> Zerxer: It's not actually but close
[10:36:37] <Trisox> class = destination
[10:36:54] <Skola> systemfault single quotes?
[10:37:04] <electissimi> idk, it just isn't...
[10:37:08] <Zerxer> oh right, no quotes around the names, malformed
[10:37:11] <systemfault> Skola: Keys should be without doublequotes
[10:37:15] <systemfault> Heh :)
[10:37:16] <Skola> yeah
[10:37:23] <systemfault> Errr
[10:37:24] <Skola> but I mean values
[10:37:30] <systemfault> s/without/within :(
[10:37:31] <systemfault> Sorryyy
[10:37:35] <Zerxer> electissimi: do you have control over how that data is put on the page? can you make it not malformed?
[10:37:39] <Skola> ah right :p
[10:37:44] <systemfault> Skola: Values are fine
[10:38:00] <electissimi> Zerker: i can but that defeats the purpose it needs specific syntax
[10:38:10] <Zerxer> what
[10:38:15] <Skola> I don't like hanging my data on DOM elements
[10:38:18] <electissimi> it must be like that
[10:38:21] <Zerxer> what else are you doing with it?
[10:38:32] <Trisox> wy not skola
[10:38:35] <electissimi> an ajax call from a php script
[10:38:41] <electissimi> using plugin: Flot
[10:38:42] <Zerxer> you want to grab it and turn it into an object to pass to another function
[10:38:43] <Skola> $.data() is cleaner
[10:38:56] <Skola> I mean I don't want to manipulate the dom for state, if possible
[10:39:00] <Zerxer> but you can't turn it into an object because the string is malformed
[10:39:07] <Zerxer> so how does fixing it defeat any purposes
[10:39:15] <Trisox> depends on what your doing
[10:39:16] <electissimi> it isn't malformed.. it just isn't JSON
[10:39:31] <Zerxer> is anyone else lost
[10:39:41] <electissimi> it isn't supposed to be JSON
[10:40:11] <Skola> I'm a bit lost as to why the value of the element is formatted like that
[10:40:19] <Zerxer> you said you need to pass an array to your other function, right?
[10:40:22] <electissimi> http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/pie.html
[10:40:28] <Skola> instead of just "labelname, 123"
[10:40:58] <electissimi> view the javascript on that page
[10:40:59] <Zerxer> looks to me like that is accepting a json object of values
[10:41:03] <electissimi> look at the commented out var data =[]
[10:42:34] <Zerxer> I don't think I see any commented out var data
[10:42:40] <electissimi> if that was the case though, this would parse: {label: "Hitpoints",  data: 1200}
[10:42:51] <electissimi> Zerker: check the active javascript
[10:43:03] <electissimi> what it's using to make the charts
[10:43:19] <Zerxer> oh I was checking the external scripts
[10:43:23] <phlp> he's talking about the json
[10:43:41] <Zerxer> it's a json object merely wrapped in an array
[10:44:01] <Zerxer> so do exactly what I said. make your string not malformed, perform parseJSON on it, then do data = [data]
[10:44:15] <Trisox> ?jsonlint
[10:44:15] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[10:46:40] <Zerxer> electissimi: I'm assuming you're creating your string from a PHP page? if it's a PHP array, you could easily echo out json_encode($data) and it would give you a non-malformed string

[10:47:07] <bot-t> Skola, Freebie: WhatsThis? jQuery Plugin :: Echo Enduring Blog - A Web ... - http://blog.echoenduring.com/2010/12/24/freebie-whatsthis-jquery-plugin/
[10:47:07] <electissimi> Zerker: does that work with two parameters?
[10:47:10] <Skola> lol
[10:47:17] <Skola> it actually found something
[10:48:00] <Trisox> O'realy
[10:48:01] <Zerxer> electissimi: two parameters? you could do json_encode(array($array1, $array2)) if you mean you want an array containing two different ones (like [{foo:bar}, {foo:bar}]
[10:48:16] <Zerxer> or by two parameters
[10:48:20] <Zerxer> do you mean "{label: "Hitpoints",  data: 1200}," having label and data?
[10:48:26] <electissimi> yes
[10:48:39] <electissimi> the label and data
[10:48:45] <Zerxer> $data = array('label'=>'Hitpoints', 'data'=>1200); print json_encode($data);
[10:49:06] <Zerxer> you'd pass it an array and it'd turn it into a json object string of it
[10:49:12] <electissimi> ah ok
[10:49:15] <Zerxer> so yes it'd be {"label": "Hitpoints", "data": 1200}
[10:49:34] <Zerxer> why are you putting this in a div anyways? are people going to be modifying it?
[10:49:44] <Skola> that's what I was puzzled about
[10:49:56] <Skola> or still am
[10:50:13] <Skola> seems like a detour
[10:50:14] <electissimi> no, just seemed like the easiest way to grab a certain piece of data i needed from a php script that also returns multiple other things
[10:50:39] <Zerxer> if you're doing an ajax request that pulls html and puts it onto the page, you could have that html have <script> tags in it and they'd get parsed when you put the html in
[10:50:41] <Skola> can't you construct your plot server side?
[10:51:28] <electissimi> <script> doesn't work when grabbing the html through an ajax call
[10:51:32] <Zerxer> but anyways, if your div has the string returned by json_encode, then you can grab it with .html() or .text() and $.parseJSON() on it, and then put it in an array [] and should be fine
[10:51:53] <Zerxer> if you're grabbing html through an ajax call, and putting it into the dom with .html(returnedContent), then script tags should be parsed
[10:51:55] <Zerxer> always are for me
[10:52:53] <electissimi> on ajax callback i have: $("#character-details").html(data).show();
[10:53:10] <electissimi> didn't bring the <script> through
[10:53:50] <orolo> how do i extend an inner object. like: $.extend(array.obect1, object2) ?
[10:54:39] <Zerxer> electissimi: try it again, put <script>alert('hi');</script> inside your ajax page's returned html
[10:55:37] <koichirose> Hello. I'm trying to implement my own infinite scroll. I'd like it to fire 100px before the bottom of the page. Here's what I did: http://pastie.org/2038777 - it fires correctly, but sometimes it fires 5-6 times in a row...
[10:55:52] <electissimi> why did that work...but the script i had before didn't?
[10:56:06] <Zerxer> orolo: it sounds like you answered your own question. store the return content in array.object1 then, or in whatever new object you wanted
[10:56:15] <Zerxer> electissimi: I don't know, errors
[10:56:25] <orolo> Zerxer: well. it's not working.
[10:56:49] <orolo> Zerxer: 	i'll paste. thank you.
[10:56:51] <electissimi> actually i think i had it working like that before but it couldn't find the element i wanted to plot
[10:57:01] <electissimi> because it was through an ajax call
[10:58:46] <devinrolsen> If you go here, http://tinyurl.com/3hzngcl you will see that this code http://pastebin.com/REHM1U1t works just fine. Now if I take that page's script and turn it into a bookmarklet and run it over another site, I keep getting this error "$("body").layout is not a function".
[10:58:57] <devinrolsen> Anyone know why introducing the above code as a bookmarklet would say the gathered script's methods are not available?
[10:59:16] <Raverix> Conflict with the $?
[10:59:23] <Raverix> I haven't looked at your code.
[10:59:30] <Raverix> But havey ou tried jQuery("body")
[10:59:39] <devinrolsen> yes, same result.
[11:03:08] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[11:03:20] <devinrolsen> hey wkmanire
[11:04:16] <sven_oostenbrink> Zerxer: Would name="user[1]name", name="user[2]name", etc also function?
[11:05:05] <Zerxer> sven_oostenbrink: no, don't think so. but you might be able to do user[1][name] because I know you could do user[name] and have named parameters. not sure about stacking arrays, since I haven't done it myself, but try that
[11:06:05] <devinrolsen> hmm Raverix, ok good call, I changed everything to jQuery but also moved that snip to the bottom of the script and its working great now.
[11:06:06] <sven_oostenbrink> Zerxer: Ahhh! ofcourse! :) Thing is, I've used arrays like that in html on multiple occasions, but never with jQuery... Dumb me, I forgot to add [ ]  for the second index.. :)
[11:06:11] <anilali> can someone help me out with a jquery validation issues when using custom validator
[11:06:23] <kukosk> hi all â€¦ this works ok on my mac (chrome) but it â€¦ kinda disables all clicks on my page on the iPhone (safari)â€¦ do you have any idea why ?
[11:06:23] <kukosk> http://pastebin.com/WdRAfWhR
[11:06:23] <kukosk> when i delete 3. and 4. line, my page works just fine ...
[11:06:49] <devinrolsen> strange part is that nothing outside of the callback of the getScript is dependent of the scripts it gathers.. so little baffled over why moving it to the bottom would fix anything.. but oh well
[11:07:21] <orolo> Zerxer:  http://jsfiddle.net/orolo/TDeK5/3/
[11:07:47] <orolo> i think the "original" object is getting wiped out.
[11:08:05] <sven_oostenbrink> Zerxer: works like a charm! :)
[11:08:15] <kukosk> hi all â€¦ this works ok on my mac (chrome) but it â€¦ kinda disables all clicks on my page on the iPhone (safari)â€¦ do you have any idea why ?

[11:09:43] <unruthless> Hey all, question for anyone familiar with the jQuery Cycle plugin: say each slide is a link. By default, clicking on a slide advances the next slide. Is there a way to make clicking on the slides follow the link, instead? (There's an external pager to handle navigation between the slides.)
[11:10:31] <unruthless> The jQuery Cycle plugin: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ and my demo showing the default behavior, with a separate pager: http://www.glad.org/home/v3
[11:11:02] <d4rklit3> can i do
[11:11:06] <d4rklit3> $(element).click()
[11:11:10] <d4rklit3> and it will pretent it was clicked
[11:11:26] <tmayr> yes
[11:12:24] <anilali> does anybody know why a custom validation rule won't fire when the textbox is empty but will fire when it's not
[11:12:50] <Trisox> sure
[11:13:02] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/6dncR/
[11:13:05] <Trisox> :P
[11:13:08] <phentges> Working with a jQueryUI buttonset. I want to fire a function when a button is clicked, but not if the button has already been clicked. See http://jsfiddle.net/thejbru/YdqPK/3/ Clicking on "Yes" repeatedly increased the Minor Change value.
[11:13:25] <Trisox> anilali look @ that
[11:13:34] <Trisox> bit more advanced but you get it
[11:13:50] <anilali> i am...thnx..will ping u if any further ?
[11:13:57] <Trisox> also ignore : empty
[11:14:17] <Trisox> i'm gonna watch soccer
[11:14:22] <Trisox> it starts soon
[11:14:44] <Trisox> brb smoke
[11:14:51] <anilali> cool njoy the game
[11:14:57] <abjorn> man fuck the haters, Wii U is gonna be awesome. all those haters can stfu and go play their cowaduty and haloz with the other 12 year olds
[11:15:20] <djQuery> phentges: what class does the button have when it is allready selected?
[11:15:21] <devinrolsen> Last question, because my script be ran as a bookmarklet on any given site you happen to be browsing, jquery needs to be added to the document via my script if in fact that page does not have jquery.
[11:15:27] <kukosk> hey please someoneâ€¦ im completely lost :)â€¦ this works ok on my mac (chrome) but it â€¦ kinda disables all clicks on my page on the iPhone (safari)â€¦ do you have any idea why ?
[11:15:27] <kukosk> http://pastebin.com/WdRAfWhR
[11:15:27] <kukosk> when i delete 3. and 4. line, my page works just fine ...
[11:15:38] <devinrolsen> what would be the best approach to adding jquery to the documents header via JS?
[11:15:44] <devinrolsen> head*
[11:16:22] <naton> devinrolsen: any method would do fine
[11:16:26] <bryandowning> unruthless do you have anything specified for next in the cycle options?
[11:16:27] <phentges> djQuery: Clicking it adds a ui-state-active class. If I check on that, however, it won't fire the first time it's clicked.
[11:17:57] <djQuery> phentges: thought this would have dont it but it doesnt fire at all now $('ui-button:not(.ui-state-active)').live(
[11:18:26] <djQuery> phentges: ah forgot my period
[11:18:57] <unruthless> bryandowning: I did have something specified for next in the cycle options, but never mind, I've figured it out! Needed to specify "after:   onAfter " in the settings. Relevant demo: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/anchor.html
[11:19:09] <phentges> djQuery: So make it a live action instead of a click action ... OK, I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
[11:19:36] <djQuery> phentges: basicily use live to exclude items that are currently allready selected
[11:20:16] <devinrolsen> naton, http://pastebin.com/Y186WPvW is what I am currently using.. but when I run the script (again as a bookmarklet) over a page who natively has no jquery, it keeps telling me that "jQuery is not a function".
[11:20:22] <djQuery> phentges: or stick with your original code and just check to see if it currently has the ui-state-active and just return if it does
[11:20:54] <phentges> djQuery: Thanks for the tips!
[11:22:02] <anilali> Trisox ignore :empty didn't help
[11:22:24] <devinrolsen> oh wow, hmm but if I run the script twice lol, it seems to work just fine... ok its a time issue..
[11:22:24] <anilali> seems like the required validator is firing and my custom rule doesn't fire
[11:24:34] <Raverix> devinrolsen: your script requires jquery to be on the page.
[11:24:41] <Raverix> You're using jQuery to load in the UI
[11:24:55] <devinrolsen> but only after installing jquery do I use getScript.
[11:25:07] <Raverix> Might I make a suggestion to change how you're doing this?
[11:25:12] <devinrolsen> yes please
[11:25:40] <devinrolsen> just keep in mind this will be ran as a bookmarklet over other sites.
[11:26:46] <Raverix> your bookmarklet should only do something like: var scriptTag = document.createElement('script'); scriptTag.src = "http://blah.com/yourscript.js"; document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);
[11:27:38] <devinrolsen> so combine all external scripts into one file.
[11:27:49] <Raverix> Yeah.
[11:27:51] <Raverix> here:
[11:27:52] <Raverix> javascript:var%20s%20=%20document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='http://yourdomain.com/script.js';void(0);
[11:28:04] <Raverix> Just change yourdomain.com and that's good to go.
[11:28:07] <devinrolsen> only reason I didnt do that is because I was trying to avoid linking to scripts on my own sever
[11:28:10] <devinrolsen> vs CDN.
[11:28:16] <_ramo> does anyone has an idea, why this ticker is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/9emqR/1/ ?
[11:28:19] <Raverix> Then use a cdn.
[11:28:25] <devinrolsen> $$ :\
[11:28:35] <Raverix> Use a free one.
[11:28:52] <devinrolsen> Any good recommendation on a good free one?
[11:28:57] <mixmasterxp> If I'm doing a anchor based navigation using hashes (something like what github does), is using a timer to check if the windows.location.hash changes is the best thing?
[11:29:00] <devinrolsen> cause I totally down to doing that.
[11:29:07] <devinrolsen> I'm
[11:29:07] <Raverix> yourdomain.com.nyud.net/script.js
[11:29:08] <mixmasterxp> as stated in this tutorial: http://yensdesign.com/2008/11/creating-ajax-websites-based-on-anchor-navigation/
[11:29:11] <bryandowning> unruthless cool!
[11:29:37] <Skola> can anybody recommend an _advanced_ jQuery book?
[11:29:39] <devinrolsen> ok, yeah.. great suggestion Raverix..
[11:29:41] <devinrolsen> thank you!
[11:29:50] <Skola> that deals with optimizations and code organization etc
[11:30:31] <kukosk> hi all â€¦ when i put this into the bind of document mousemove, all the clicks i make on my sites are cancelled â€¦
[11:30:31] <kukosk> $('#mouseLoader');
[11:30:35] <Skola> or shall I wait for John Resig's new book? : ]
[11:31:16] <phrearch> hey
[11:31:25] <phrearch> is there an event that fires while the mousebutton is down?
[11:31:40] <phrearch> i mean all the time, not like mousedown/click
[11:31:57] <Skola> what does all the time mean?
[11:32:05] <Skola> you can set a timeout
[11:32:08] <phrearch> ehm, like as fast as possible
[11:32:50] <phrearch> Skola: timeout to trigger the event again?
[11:32:55] <devinrolsen> Ok, Raverix so yeah, that not only is a good suggestion but good timing as well cause I need to combine my images into a sprite as well..
[11:33:04] <Skola> well you can use setInterval
[11:33:26] <phrearch> ah
[11:33:26] <phrearch> http://remysharp.com/demo/mousehold.js
[11:33:39] <Skola> to trigger it every x milliseconds _between_ mousedown and mouseup
[11:33:43] <Skola> yes or use a plugin
[11:33:46] <phrearch> ok thanks. that will work is ee
[11:33:47] <phrearch> see
[11:33:48] <Raverix> Occasionally, I know what I'm doing.
[11:34:37] <phrearch> k, tvtime
[11:34:40] <phrearch> later
[11:34:44] <Skola> later
[11:35:41] <plug918> how can i pop a new window instead of opening a new tag? window.open does not seems to work
[11:36:10] <Skola> the browser generally controls that kind of behaviour AFAIK
[11:36:30] <Skola> there are ways to do it in some browsers, stackoverflow has some answers on it
[11:36:34] <Skola> ?stackoverflow
[11:36:35] <bot-t> where all your answers can be found â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/
[11:36:49] <Juzzy> yea, correct
[11:36:55] <Raverix> Which is ironic since stack overflow is typically a problem.
[11:37:02] <Juzzy> they used to do it in flash too, havn't seen it in a while though
[11:37:20] <devinrolsen> Raverix, not only will this help with all the getScript confusion, but I could also set it up to house the entire script in one spot so each update I make will be made on everyone's copy of the bookmarklet.. sorry this has me all excited all over again.
[11:37:34] <Juzzy> tpb does an onclick pop under which doesnt get caught by ff
[11:37:46] <Skola> plug918 I think I have some code for it in an old project, 1 sec
[11:37:50] <Juzzy> as does phpmyadmin
[11:38:09] <Raverix> devinrolsen: Good, now use your powers for good, not evil.
[11:38:59] <devinrolsen> lol but I thought the app I was building was already for good :) I mean a full CSS auditor tool.. thats got to be of the good side right?
[11:40:10] <Skola> plug918 sorry can't find it right now
[11:40:38] <djQuery> ?.empty
[11:40:39] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[11:41:06] <plug918> Skola: Never mind, i figure out,
[11:41:09] <plug918> window.open($(this).attr('href'), "_blank", "status = 1, height = 600, width = 500, resizable = 0" );
[11:41:15] <plug918> this will do it
[11:41:58] <Skola> that won't work in all browsers
[11:42:02] <Skola> just so you know
[11:42:29] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, does getScript automatically run the script when loaded? thanks
[11:42:42] <GeoDud> you are welcome
[11:43:14] <Skola> plug918 that code will not open a window in latest FF/Chrome
[11:43:53] <Skola> but you'll be hardpressed to find a cross-browser solution
[11:43:59] <djQuery> mbutubuntu: think so hoverver if you have a particular function inside the script you want to call you can do $.getScript('url', functionname)
[11:44:27] <anilali> jquery validation question regarding custom validation rule.  http://jsfiddle.net/Pfg8s/6/ .  Seems like the required validator gets fired when textbox is empty and doesn't give control over to the custom rule
[11:44:29] <Skola> if you _really_ need this functionality I suggest you look at the hacks used by pop-up advertisements
[11:46:13] <djQuery> plug918: Skola: http://www.gtalbot.org/BugzillaSection/Bug195867GDR_WindowOpen.html
[11:46:24] <gadlol> Hi to all, I have a question: IS it a good practice to have in a plugin options that are arrays? example opacity[0,0], FIRST argument refers to an element and the SECOND to another elem.. OR is it good to have it like this: elem1_opacity:0 , elem2_opacity:0 ?????????????????????????
[11:46:41] <mbutubuntu> djQuery, I've no function, it is just runnable code
[11:47:09] <wkmanire> gadlol: [0,0] is a syntax error I believe.
[11:47:16] <Skola> you mean you have anonymous functions?
[11:47:17] <wkmanire> javascript does not have matrices.
[11:47:25] <blkcat> gadlol: the twenty thousand question marks are probably a syntax error too ;)
[11:47:44] <Kambfhase> ?[0,0] @ wkmanire
[11:47:46] <koichirose> Hello. I'm trying to implement my own infinite scroll. I'd like it to fire 100px before the bottom of the page. Here's what I did: http://pastie.org/2038777 - it fires correctly, but sometimes it fires 5-6 times in a row...
[11:47:46] <bot-t> wkmanire, Hilite 1.0.0-0 | jQuery Plugins - Usage: http://plugins.jquery.com/content/hilite-100-0
[11:47:52] <Kambfhase> whoops
[11:48:00] <Skola> in fact every character will throw one :D
[11:48:13] <wkmanire> hmm?
[11:48:15] <Skola> gadlol, it depends
[11:48:32] <Kambfhase> wkmanire: [0,0] looks like an array too me
[11:48:33] <gadlol> I have a plugin and i work it like this options.blabla[0,3,5] and it works but i need to know what isd the best practice? Performance?
[11:48:57] <Skola> you mean options.blabla = [0,3,5]
[11:49:03] <wkmanire> You can declare array literals that way
[11:49:05] <Skola> which is fine
[11:49:26] <wkmanire> But you can't access them that way.
[11:49:29] <Skola> but maybe you want to tie those values to a key instead
[11:49:41] <Raverix> Parallel arrays are typically not very nice to work with.
[11:49:58] <Skola> {obj_a: 0, obj_b: 3, obj_c: 5}
[11:49:59] <NephFl> I'm trying to used the HIUUK imageswitch plugin, I have it working on mouseover, but I need it to automatically rotate through images but I cant find an example script, has anyone seen one?
[11:50:13] <Raverix> IE: instead of options.foo = [0,1,5] and options.bar = [a,b,c]
[11:50:55] <Skola> lol
[11:51:02] <Kambfhase> koichirose: http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[11:51:03] <Raverix> You should consider options = [{foo:0, bar:a}, {foo:1, bar:b}, {foo:5, bar:c}]
[11:51:25] <gadlol> the problem is that all values must set example: blabla[0,3,4,5,6], if i use it like this blabla[0,3], then the other values are not pased in the plugin, well better the plugin does not recognize them as default values
[11:51:50] <dannymac21> Archaic_G .. you there?
[11:51:55] <Skola> bla[0,2,2,3,4,1] doesn't work
[11:52:03] <Kambfhase> blabla[0,3] << this will not give you wat you expect
[11:54:11] <dannymac21> IE bypassing validate function when using submit button?  anybody see this before?  the validation runs/works when fields lose focus.
[11:55:06] <dannymac21> anyone familiar w/validation plugin that can speak to my question above?
[11:55:42] <dannymac21> or is willing to test my page to see the behavior?
[11:56:08] <simenbrekken> I can't seem to read $(elm).css('-webkit-transform') after a normal $.ready event but it works as expected with DOMContentLoaded, is this intentional or is ready getting called too quick?
[11:56:56] <daum> hey guys - this is weird I am doing a ajax post of a form and if it is invalid it returns the html of the 'errored' form, which i do $(#form).html(json.html); return false;  however it seems that then it resubmits the page and causes a page laod.  any ideas why?
[11:57:19] <dannymac21> sigh .. i guess not ...  back to google for endless search @stackoverflow...
[11:57:35] <koichirose> Kambfhase: will try, thanks
[11:57:37] <Skola> don't whine
[11:57:42] <Archaic_G> ya whats up?
[11:57:42] <Skola> give me the link dannymac21
[11:57:50] <Kambfhase> ?p @ daum
[11:57:50] <bot-t> daum, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[11:57:50] <Skola> ./msg me
[11:57:56] <dannymac21> can i just email?
[11:58:30] <Skola> just message me here on irc ;p
[11:58:38] <ryanneufeld> dannymac21: check your syntax, and that you're using the default browser submit handler, and a submit button
[11:59:29] <Archaic_G> dannymac21: msg me your url too
[11:59:42] <daum> Kambfhase, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/402977/
[11:59:50] <daum> yuck the json example didn't really come through there
[12:01:57] <tylerl> given a <form> DOM node (i.e. from an onsubmit handler), is it there an easy way dump all the form vars into an object to send to $.ajax() ?
[12:02:04] <Kambfhase> daum: so you have html within json? sounds crazy
[12:02:21] <daum> well it is returning a form back?
[12:02:30] <Kambfhase> ?serialize @ tylerl
[12:02:30] <bot-t> tylerl, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[12:02:50] <daum> Kambfhase, it needs to reload the form on the way back because the captcha changes etc
[12:03:03] <tylerl> Kambfhase: ah. thanks
[12:04:22] <Raverix> Kambfhase: I often have HTML inside JSON.
[12:04:58] <Kambfhase> daum: quick question: when does your page reload?
[12:05:13] <Raverix> For example, an ajax request to my server will typically yield something like {script: "...", content:"...", module: "..."} etc
[12:05:29] <daum> Kambfhase, it pops up the yay alert and then reloads
[12:05:42] <daum> if it comes back with success no reload
[12:08:32] <Kambfhase> huh?
[12:09:19] <Kambfhase> is your page live?
[12:09:55] <Nomikos> How can I tell an element is a textarea if I fetched it by class?
[12:10:24] <Kambfhase> ?is @ Nomikos
[12:10:24] <bot-t> Nomikos, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[12:11:11] <Nomikos> Kambfhase: thank you. Is there also a function that will return the tag type without checking for each?
[12:11:33] <Nomikos> Right now I'm using elm.get(0).tagName.toLowerCase(); -- I assume there is something shorter..
[12:11:34] <d4rklit3> i seemed to have overlooked this
[12:11:49] <gnarf> Nomikos: elm[0]
[12:12:03] <d4rklit3> i want to link somewhere off page from .click(function
[12:12:09] <d4rklit3> what ist he method for that
[12:12:16] <gnarf> Nomikos: but elm.is("textarea") works too
[12:12:56] <Nomikos> gnarf: elm[0] returns "[object HTMLTextAreaElement]"
[12:13:16] <gnarf> Nomikos: right... elm[0].tagName.toLowerCase()
[12:13:23] <gnarf> its one less function call
[12:13:23] <daum> Kambfhase, it isn't sorry, the code i pasted you see the alert('yay') after the replace of the HTML that gets called but then cuases a refresh, the if(data.success) alert('go ...') gets called on a success and doesn't cause a page load right now
[12:13:38] <Nomikos> gnarf: oh right, I see, [0] instead of get(0)
[12:13:57] <gnarf> Nomikos: elm.eq(0).is("textarea")
[12:14:03] <Kambfhase> daum: i only see a boo, no yay here.
[12:14:06] <redgetan> How do i add a callback function for .replaceWith() . i want to execute a function after its called and all DOM elements have been loaded
[12:14:26] <gnarf> redgetan: execute the function after you call replaceWith()
[12:14:28] <daum> Kambfhase, doh sorry the 'boo', had changed that just before i pasted
[12:14:28] <gnarf> its not async
[12:15:05] <Nomikos> gnarf: the reason I'm wanting it is to be able to run through a bunch of random form fields, and building a {name: value} object. Right now I have a switch checking for tagtype inside elms.each(), is that the right way to go about it?
[12:15:23] <gnarf> Nomikos: see ?.serialize
[12:15:23] <bot-t> Nomikos, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[12:15:43] <gnarf> although tbh, you don't need to check the type afaik
[12:15:48] <gnarf> you could just .val() it
[12:16:51] <Nomikos> gnarf: that didn't seem to work for checkboxes, but I might have missed something
[12:16:57] <Nomikos> gnarf: serialize looks promising
[12:17:18] <Kambfhase> daum:  it could be that in the page you load some code trigger the reload not sure though
[12:17:29] <daum> hmm yah will have to look
[12:17:29] <daum> thanks
[12:17:55] <AstroMix> hello, could anyone maybe give me a pointer on an if() statement for this jquery bit? The jsfiddle doesn't seem to work, but it works on my site just fine - the only issue is that whenever i have actual content in the inputs the onblur function runs
[12:17:56] <AstroMix> http://jsfiddle.net/2Dt3P/
[12:19:38] <Kambfhase> wow, thats an ID!
[12:20:04] <AstroMix> i know
[12:20:10] <AstroMix> :P
[12:20:40] <Kambfhase> Do you know Chaining?
[12:21:16] <AstroMix> me? nope.
[12:21:39] <Kambfhase> ok, let me just rewrite that fiddle
[12:21:51] <Nomikos> Is there something like serialize() that returns one object instead of array of objects?
[12:22:00] <ryanneufeld> AstroMix: Kambfhase
[12:22:01] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/2Dt3P/1/
[12:22:25] <ryanneufeld> need to include jquery
[12:22:43] <AstroMix> heh, woopsie, i've not used jfiddle before
[12:22:46] <AstroMix> (pretty neat)
[12:22:57] <Kambfhase> still bad code
[12:23:53] <Nomikos> ehr. meant serializeArray, found a plugin for it though, now
[12:24:19] <eddiemonge> AstroMix,  chaining would really help. also the inputs before the # are unnecessary and is slow
[12:24:36] <AstroMix> well feel free to give me some pointers, i'm relatively new to jquery
[12:24:42] <redgetan> gnarf: ic, i thought there might be other DOM events that i can listen to
[12:25:26] <Kambfhase> AstroMix: http://jsfiddle.net/2Dt3P/3/
[12:25:30] <AstroMix> chaining, i'm guessing is the way of using $('something').attr(some stuff).something(stuff).something(stuff)?
[12:25:54] <Jayflux> Nomikos what was the plugin called
[12:26:16] <Nomikos> Jayflux: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[12:26:25] <Jayflux> n1
[12:26:48] <Nomikos> it doesn't catch unchecked checkboxes alas, but it looks simple, maybe I can edit..
[12:27:42] <eddiemonge> AstroMix, you might also want to look at the html5 placeholder tag and maybe use modernizr for html5-less browsers
[12:28:04] <Kambfhase> ^ that plus a placeholder plugin
[12:28:35] <AstroMix> nice tip eddiemonge thank you!
[12:28:39] <AstroMix> i had forgotten about that one
[12:31:32] <[E]sc> assume i have several jquery and scripts, can these jquery plugins interfere with each other scripts?
[12:31:49] <daum> Kambfhase, was the iframe for the captcha that was botching it
[12:31:58] <Woet> [E]sc: sure, all javascript can interfere eachother
[12:32:10] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:32:59] <[E]sc> Woet, i see, can they cause the other script not to run? i have several scripts that work fine on their own but when i try to combine them into one page they aren't executing properly.
[12:33:15] <Woet> [E]sc: all is possible. do you see anything in your browser's console/debugger?
[12:35:31] <[E]sc> Woet, from what i can see, there doesn't seem to be any problems.  mind you, i'm using someone else's scripts...
[12:35:49] <Woet> [E]sc: i would personally enable the other scripts one by one until it stops working
[12:35:58] <Woet> then start commenting out code in that specific script until it stops working
[12:36:04] <Woet> and you would find the culprit code :)
[12:37:03] <[E]sc> haha ... ahh sounds tedious. thanks Woet i'll give that a go
[12:38:27] <Kambfhase> [E]sc: is you page live?
[12:39:08] <dschuett> how do you preload images using jquery/ajax?
[12:40:25] <[E]sc> Kambfhase, unfortunately it is not...
[12:40:32] <BrandonZacharie> dschuett: you may use new Image()
[12:41:22] <BrandonZacharie> dschuett: var img = new Image(); img.load = function() { alert('loaded!') }; img.src= 'foo.jpg';
[12:42:03] <Kambfhase> BrandonZacharie: that should be onload iirc
[12:42:46] <BrandonZacharie> dschuett: $('<img />').bind('load', function(){ alert('loaded!')  }).attr('src', 'foo.jpg')
[12:42:58] <trumpetmic> all: jQuery UI, or jQuery Mobile, or...?
[12:43:19] <BrandonZacharie> dschuett: img.load should in fact be img.onload as Kambfhase noted
[12:43:51] <Kambfhase> trumpetmic: dojo!
[12:44:02] * Kambfhase ducks, runs and hides.
[12:45:12] <trumpetmic> haha
[12:45:31] <trumpetmic> so... anyone want to give me a non 'run and hide' opinion?
[12:45:57] <Woet> trumpetmic: what is your question?
[12:46:15] <Woet> you cannot do 'or' on jQuery UI and jQuery mobile
[12:46:20] <Woet> they have different purposes
[12:46:36] <trumpetmic> jQuery Mobile seems to have some overlap and perhaps plans around the desktop space
[12:46:45] <sumeetjain> My page has several buttons (class=edit_offer). Each button loads a form into a jQuery UI modal window when it's clicked. The form inside the window submits via AJAX successfully, and then the modal window contents are replaced with the returned HTML. But the NEXT time I click a button, the form is loaded into a modal window, the form submits successfully, but the modal window contents are NOT replaced with the returned HTML. Any id
[12:46:46] <sumeetjain> Code: https://gist.github.com/1015192
[12:46:57] <trumpetmic> also wondering if there are other options or philosophies that might lead me away from using jQuery UI
[12:46:58] <dschuett> BrandonZacharie: this is what i'm working with...i'm actually calling a php file which is echoing a div based on what they click on. The div contains images...some from a css file. http://pastebin.com/DCUTJe7n
[12:48:25] <eddiemonge> trumpetmic,  jqm doesn not have plans around the desktop space and in fact uses jqui for lots of stuff
[12:55:19] <guy> [..] bind('onload' [..]
[12:55:27] <guy>  doesn't seem to work
[12:55:33] <trumpetmic> thanks eddimonge
[12:55:57] <Kambfhase> guy: [..] is invalid javascript syntax
[12:56:08] <guy> [..] as in $('#share-form textarea').bind('keyup keydown', function(){
[12:56:23] <guy> +onload
[12:56:31] <Kambfhase> ?p @ guy
[12:56:31] <bot-t> guy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:56:59] <guy> https://gist.github.com/b0e749cc524e83e5c3fe
[12:57:34] <Kambfhase> which jq version?
[12:57:42] <guy> latest
[12:57:44] <guy> stable
[12:58:12] <guy> bug : ( ?
[12:58:22] <guy> looks like actually.
[12:58:34] <dschuett> http://pastebin.com/DCUTJe7n - why is my .show('slow') not working on line 7? I have even tried fadeIn...slide...
[12:58:35] <Kambfhase> do $(document).ready
[12:58:48] <guy> there is no reason why this should not work following the jquery syntax
[12:58:57] <Kambfhase> As of jQuery 1.4, calling the jQuery() method with no arguments returns an empty jQuery set (with a .length property of 0). In previous versions of jQuery, this would return a set containing the document node.
[12:59:01] <guy> Kambfhase: same
[12:59:36] <eddiemonge> guy $(function() {   your code here   });
[12:59:56] <Kambfhase> that is not the issue here, eddiemonge
[13:00:12] <guy> same, + I don't see how this can affect the code
[13:00:13] <Kambfhase> guy: a text area does not trigger onload ;)
[13:00:17] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase,  really? because its doing the same thing you just said
[13:00:21] <guy> Kambfhase: ie, bug.
[13:00:28] <Kambfhase> no
[13:00:33] <disappearedng> Does jquery have the ability to set the css width and height of a global css rule?
[13:00:36] <guy> Kambfhase: of course it is. : )
[13:00:51] <guy> disappearedng: "global css"?
[13:01:17] <disappearedng> like I have a rule, .tiles { height:50px; width: 50px} and then I want jquery to change this and apply to everything
[13:01:19] <Kambfhase> a) it should be load b) you dont need to load a textarea, its not an image.
[13:01:21] <eddiemonge> dschuett, its already showing from line 4. you have to hide it before you can show it
[13:01:36] <guy> disappearedng: $('.title').css({color: 'red'});
[13:02:07] <systemfault> disappearedng: It's pretty much never a good idea to play with stylesheet that way..
[13:02:16] <systemfault> disappearedng: use classes.
[13:02:42] <guy> systemfault: he is using classes
[13:02:59] <Kambfhase> guy: feel free to open a ticket, but i guess it will be rejected
[13:03:03] <systemfault> guy: He wants to change the stylesheet itself
[13:03:21] <asadpakistani> does $.ajax does not work on external domains?
[13:03:31] <sumeetjain> disappearedng: jQuery won't change the stylesheet itself. It will just affect the selected elements on the current page.
[13:03:31] <guy> systemfault: I don't think he wants to "edit the file"; he didn't say that anywhere.
[13:03:51] <sumeetjain> disappearedng: You can probably achieve your desired result.
[13:03:51] <dschuett> eddiemonge: i just replaced .show() with .hide() and all that does is hide the preloader gif...
[13:04:03] <jeffsmykil> Important question: Grizzly bear and a hippo get in a fight, who wins?
[13:04:04] <guy> and $('.title').css({color: 'red'}); does exactly what he asked
[13:04:13] <ajpiano> ?g jquery rule plugin flesler @ disappearedng
[13:04:14] <bot-t> disappearedng, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[13:04:23] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ asadpakistani
[13:04:25] <bot-t> asadpakistani, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:04:37] <guy> is $(function(){}); preferred over $().ready(function(){});?
[13:05:06] <Kambfhase> guy: https://gist.github.com/01dc561eda1e3d470bc1
[13:05:10] <eddiemonge> dschuett,  yeah. if you want the preloader image and different content then you need a different element for the preloader
[13:05:35] <sumeetjain> asadpakistani: Also, http://enable-cors.org. You can get external content if the third-party page is configured for it. (This doesn't work in - I think - IE7 and below.)
[13:05:38] <guy> that's stupid Kambfhase. you are creating redundant global function. simple $('#share-form textarea').trigger('keyup'); will do.
[13:05:43] <eddiemonge> guy,  its a convenience method and its preferable because its less code
[13:06:10] <Kambfhase> totally not global
[13:06:26] <guy> ...
[13:06:32] <Kambfhase> but yeah, that trigger is smart
[13:06:37] <eddiemonge> but totally redundant
[13:06:45] <systemfault> guy: I don't think there's a preferable one..
[13:06:58] <systemfault> I use .ready because it's more explicit :/
[13:07:01] <ajpiano> the best would be use text with a function
[13:07:29] <guy> systemfault: ++ I am more used to it. Though, since someone corrected me, I thought there is a way considered a standard.
[13:08:08] <Kambfhase> The standard is to put your scripts at the end of <bod>
[13:09:18] <sumeetjain> I'm having an issue where element.html() works the first time it's called - but not the second, third, etc. Has anyone experienced something similar?
[13:09:19] <guy> Kambfhase: <head> is preferred in most cases.
[13:09:27] <systemfault> guy: That's an old lie
[13:09:37] <sumeetjain> Details for my question: My page has several buttons (class=edit_offer). Each button loads a form into a jQuery UI modal window when it's clicked. The form inside the window submits via AJAX successfully, and then the modal window contents are replaced with the returned HTML. But the NEXT time I click a button, the form is loaded into a modal window, the form submits successfully, but the modal window contents are NOT replaced with 
[13:09:37] <sumeetjain> returned HTML. Any ideas? Code: https://gist.github.com/1015192
[13:09:40] <guy> systemfault: Google says that, I trust google. : )
[13:09:48] <systemfault> guy: Where ? :)
[13:10:24] <systemfault> guy: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom
[13:10:33] <guy> ah. I read some docs prepared by google about ajax friendly pages. weeks ago, though I noticed that they highlighted that code should always be either <head> or at the end of <body>
[13:10:42] <Kambfhase> sumeetjain: did you try http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[13:10:53] <asadpakistani> sumeetjain: k thanks, i was very confused as to why my application was not working. So i guess i will have to proxy the external data thru my web server, well its allso a good oppurtunity to filter xss that way
[13:11:06] <eddiemonge> guy,  it should be at the end of the body unless its writing something or needs to be loaded before other stuff
[13:11:07] <sumeetjain> asadpakistani: Best of luck.
[13:11:15] <asadpakistani> sumeetjain: thanks
[13:11:42] <guy> "If a script can be deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster."
[13:11:43] <systemfault> guy: I usually add libs like jquery in the <head> but all mine at the bottom
[13:12:16] <ajpiano> guy: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/12/06/evolution-of-script-loading/
[13:12:17] <guy> aren't they referring to the explicit case when script can be deffered? which is not very supported.
[13:12:40] <sumeetjain> Kambfhase: Thanks - yes I've read that. I use 'live' for my bindings.
[13:12:42] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, is there a div with id of editOfferContent still?
[13:12:49] <guy> ok. will read this. thanks for the discussion. got to get back to work.
[13:12:55] <systemfault> :)
[13:13:03] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, also dont use alert as a debugging tool. console.log() is better
[13:13:15] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: That was my first thought, too - but it appears to still exist. I don't think element.html() replaces 'element' - right? Only the stuff inside it.
[13:13:47] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Agreed. I switched to Chrome recently and am having trouble with the console. Things don't show up. I haven't had a chance to look into it yet.
[13:14:02] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  right. are you sure it exists? before it do console.log( $('#editOfferContent').length );
[13:14:40] <kataire> Is it okay to find jQuery-UI repulsively ugly?
[13:15:06] <sumeetjain> kataire: Sure.
[13:15:11] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Yup, returns '1'.
[13:15:14] <sumeetjain> (Both times.)
[13:15:18] * MajorMalfunction hands out CSS files :)
[13:15:29] <djQuery> damn canvas is a pain in the ass
[13:15:59] <systemfault> jquery UI's default look is a bit like an apple product..
[13:16:03] <Archaic_G> sounds like your putting the canvas in the wrong spot :S
[13:16:05] <systemfault> You either hate it.. or love it.
[13:16:30] <Kambfhase> djQuery: welcome to the rage side of javascript
[13:16:32] <djQuery> trying to show an editiable data structure in a canvas
[13:16:44] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  what about console.log(  $(data).find('form')  )?
[13:17:11] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Ooh - nice suggestion. Trying that now.
[13:17:17] <djQuery> once the item is in the canvas its no longer an element in itself so stuff like dragging and clicking seems a pain in the ass
[13:17:35] <kataire> sumeetjain: Actually UI is okay. It's only the widgets that get on my nerves. Who came up with those classes?
[13:17:50] <kataire> (CSS classes that is)
[13:17:54] <Kambfhase> djQuery: may i suggest using svg?
[13:18:10] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Yup, get [object object] both times.
[13:18:15] <systemfault> kataire: At work, I modified the default look
[13:18:21] <systemfault> And the result is not too bad.
[13:18:31] <eddiemonge> kataire,  are you just here to troll?
[13:18:45] <djQuery> Kambfhase: havent looked at it yet. if I draw a rectange in svg will I be able to get the rectangle again?
[13:18:58] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  exactly. you need to do .append() and not .html()
[13:19:12] <Kambfhase> yes, afaik. its vector graphics.
[13:19:13] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, SVG is markup :)
[13:19:30] <systemfault> djQuery: They're objects you can move/add filters/transform.. etc.
[13:19:40] <meosweetmeo> hello, is there any possibility to emulate browsers's zoom by javascript?
[13:19:40] <djQuery> got a good tutorial
[13:19:57] <Kambfhase> djQuery: http://raphaeljs.com
[13:20:03] <systemfault> djQuery: I CAN HAS URL, KTHX
[13:20:12] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Really? I'll try iit out, but I don't think I understand the lesson. Do you mind explaining it a bit more?
[13:20:14] <systemfault> ANd yeah.. raphael is a must.
[13:20:37] <systemfault> Because it provides a VML fallback for IE, IIRC
[13:21:06] <djQuery> http://raphaeljs.com/graffle.html
[13:21:12] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  .html expects text. you are trying to use an object. append works with objects or text
[13:21:16] <bryandowning> does anyone know if raphael uses svg for IE9?
[13:21:35] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Why do you think it works the first time? The content is the same.
[13:22:03] <systemfault> bryandowning: I hope :( Would be so wrong if it wasn't since IE9 hardware accelerates it
[13:22:19] <bryandowning> yeah for sure
[13:22:27] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  not sure. not sure why it work at all
[13:24:09] <systemfault> bryandowning: I checked the SRC quickly.. seems to do feature detection.
[13:24:15] <systemfault> bryandowning: Probably works
[13:24:26] <bryandowning> haha beat me to it
[13:25:01] <systemfault> :)
[13:25:26] <meosweetmeo> hello, is there any possibility to emulate browsers's zoom by javascript?
[13:26:15] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: I think we're misunderstanding something. .html() seems to be intended for use as I've written it. See http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#example-8
[13:26:26] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: The relevant bit is: var content = $( data ).find( '#content' ); $( "#result" ).html( content );
[13:26:51] <bryandowning> systemfault: http://groups.google.com/group/raphaeljs/browse_thread/thread/e392826eb4f6131f
[13:27:14] <bryandowning> looks like you just need to have the HTML5 doctype and be in IE9 standards mode
[13:27:15] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, have you tried using append?
[13:27:36] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Yup - it appended the form content the first time. Nothing the next.
[13:27:42] <systemfault> bryandowning: Good to know :)
[13:27:54] <sumeetjain> Furthermore, I've also tried replacing .html($(data).find('form')) with .html('hello world') - and that also only works the first time.
[13:28:05] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: ^
[13:28:41] <djQuery> anyone know of a cdn for raphael.js? google skills not turnin up much
[13:29:08] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, do you have a link for the live code?
[13:30:09] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Sure: http://dealvita.com (You'll need to sign up. It's free. And I'll remove your account afterwards so you don't need to worry about spam.)
[13:31:15] <NickASloan> does $(document).ready() not get called when a page is loaded using the back or forward buttons?
[13:31:32] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Actually, you can just use 1@1.com and 12345678.
[13:31:42] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Save you trouble of having to confirm an account.
[13:32:02] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  and thanks for pointing out that api example. its fixed now
[13:32:56] <eddiemonge> NickASloan, it should be default
[13:33:08] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  ok what do i click?
[13:33:48] <sumeetjain> If you're looking at /show_profile: Click one of the edit buttons. Modal appears. Click Save. Content in window changes. Escape out of the window (don't refresh).
[13:34:04] <sumeetjain> Now click the other edit button. Modal appears. Click save. Content does not change.
[13:34:16] <sumeetjain> The form DID submit though. (You can see changes by refreshing.)
[13:34:53] <trumpetmic> is there a jQuery UI theme that looks like dojo dijit?
[13:35:58] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, save isnt firing anything
[13:36:36] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: The form has a submit() binding, which should be firing.
[13:37:08] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: (Or am I misunderstanding you?)
[13:37:35] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain,  actually it is firing but why are you returning a full page instead of a fragment?
[13:38:16] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: Experience, I suppose. I'm googling now.
[13:38:24] <bove> How can I launch a download with location.href, then wait and do something when it is ready? http://jsfiddle.net/fCSGH/
[13:39:20] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, googling what? on your ajax submit just append something like &ajax=true and then in your backend look for that string and if true then just return the necessary parts
[13:40:02] <eddiemonge> bove, .ready() is only for document when the page is loading
[13:40:03] <Tant102> eddiemonge, i believe ajax requests have a specific header that you can check.
[13:40:05] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: I was googling the best practice for returning fragments. Thanks for the explanation - that's useful.
[13:40:29] <eddiemonge> Tant102, i dont believe so unless you specifically pass something
[13:41:18] <bove> eddiemonge: So is there a way to know when my location.href operation is finished?
[13:41:41] <eddiemonge> bove there isnt a location.href operation
[13:42:14] <Tant102> eddiemonge, jQuery sets X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[13:42:30] <eddiemonge> bove, read https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location

[13:45:18] <BrandonZacharie> dschuett, were you able to solve your challenge? sorry for the late reply... i was afk
[13:46:07] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, .error isnt for .post() errors. try using .ajax instead of post so you can see if the response is returning an error

[13:51:39] <eddiemonge> bove, what exactly do you think window.location = "..." is doing?
[13:52:35] <eddiemonge> bove, and what exactly are you trying to do?

[13:54:04] <eddiemonge> window.location redirects the page to whatever you are redirecting it to

[14:12:10] <d4rklit3> how do i send a js array to a php service via .post
[14:12:14] <d4rklit3> can u just put it in
[14:12:14] <Newbiathon> yo, does godaddy.com allow the use of jquery, i know godaddy sucks but that is what my client bought already before even having a site ready
[14:12:31] <rabx> I am having an issue with jquery and different libraries. I have this one plugin in my WordPress site that is destroying my site's menu and slider.  I've looked at this article: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ and placed inside the javascript tag  $.noConflict();   . Still not able to resolve this. I know that if i turn the plugin off the site's menu and slider work again
[14:12:35] <d4rklit3> rather could i just say {'key' : myarray} as the data
[14:13:15] <sumeetjain> Newbiathon: Yes, GoDaddy allows jQuery.
[14:13:21] <Newbiathon> oh great
[14:13:30] <Newbiathon> looks so much faster than javascript
[14:13:42] <Trisox> its client side so wy wouldnt it run..
[14:13:44] <sumeetjain> Newbiathon: jQuery is Javascript.
[14:13:49] <Newbiathon> and cool effects that would take a year to make lol
[14:13:54] <Newbiathon> i know this summetjain
[14:14:32] <sumeetjain> Newbiathon: Sorry - I meant to type that it's Javascript, and Javascript is client-side, and client-side technologies won't be prohibited by a web host.
[14:15:23] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, serialize it
[14:15:53] <eddiemonge> rabx, does the plugin have errors? what does your console say?
[14:16:02] <rabx> Figured it out
[14:16:18] <rabx> Rather than $.noConflict(); I used jQuery.noConflict(true);
[14:16:37] <Newbiathon> im going to try to build a dynamic site with jquery and php
[14:16:37] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge: how ?
[14:17:17] <lemming> hallow
[14:17:29] <rabx> eddiemonge the console was saying that (basically) jQuery("slider") wasn't a valid function. But it's all resolved now, thanks anyway
[14:17:37] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, $.post(url, data: {your:data})
[14:17:44] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: The code you offered didn't fix the problem.
[14:17:54] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, fixes it when i put it in
[14:18:17] <Newbiathon> for a small business site that might need updating on the reg, i suppose dynamic is the way to go, i want my link sections to call to php files to change say "just the content section"
[14:18:30] <lemming> who can help me with a simple (for someone more experienced than me) question? question is: i have an accordion jquery menu, how do i get js fired when user clicks a link on it? all link are #, js code is supposed to change a div's content
[14:18:32] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, only difference is before the .live i do .die(). try that for fun.  $(ele).die().live('submit'....

[14:27:09] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge: its already a js object
[14:27:33] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: die() didn't make a difference. However, I rechecked the code you suggested. You're partially right that it works. It does seem to do the append() both times. But the form itself doesn't submit (data isn't saved). I'm looking into this now.
[14:28:16] <eddiemonge> sumeetjain, i may not have passed in the data. you should also specify a datatype of html
[14:28:25] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, ok then .post(url, data)
[14:28:54] <d4rklit3> ok
[14:28:56] <d4rklit3> hah
[14:28:57] <d4rklit3> yeah
[14:29:00] <eddiemonge> lemming, you should really learn basic javascript first before you try to do complex stuff
[14:30:25] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge: will the pho service recieve it as a string
[14:31:25] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, itll receive it as $_POST

[14:36:22] <sumeetjain> eddiemonge: It's working now. I retained my usage of .post() (since I couldn't understand why ajax() would be functionally different), but your line for handling the returned data was the secret ingredient: form.parent().empty().append($(data).find('form').first()); Thanks very much for your help.
[14:36:32] <OldCode101> I can make an api call to flickr so I know its not the content-type causing issue

[14:48:28] <byteme_> http://pastebin.com/a8LhXks9   I need to convert this to an ajax post because I'm working with asp.net and can't have nested form tags
[14:48:44] <norbi> hi guys, what is the event whe page loads and images not yet?
[14:48:52] <byteme_> but the newsletter service requires all ID's to remain the same
[14:48:54] <norbi> i want to make an image preloader
[14:49:11] <norbi> but images are loading and just after that it starts to preload the images
[14:51:14] <eddiemonge> norbi, put the script in the <head>
[14:51:48] <eddiemonge> byteme_, do the ajax in the .submit() for the form
[14:52:13] <byteme_> I need to drop the form tags if possible eddiemonge
[14:52:27] <byteme_> master pages already wrap the whole site in a form tag
[14:52:30] <byteme_> so cant nest them
[14:52:36] <norbi> eddiemonge: it is in the head
[14:52:45] <eddiemonge> ok then attach it to the click handler for the submit button
[14:52:54] <norbi> $(function(){
[14:52:54] <norbi> 		$(".content").preloadify({ imagedelay:50 });
[14:52:54] <norbi>     });
[14:52:58] <eddiemonge> norbi, then there you go.
[14:53:03] <eddiemonge> take out the $(function part
[14:53:14] <norbi> but the images are loading before it
[14:53:29] <eddiemonge> although if you do that then .content will probably not exist yet for you to attach it to
[14:53:48] <norbi> yes
[14:53:50] <eddiemonge> norbi, doesnt eh preloadify plugin tell you how to use it?
[14:54:16] <norbi> it uses it to within the function, but on the plugin site it loads normally
[14:54:29] <norbi> no cached images or images at all before of .preloadify
[14:54:34] <eddiemonge> so it doesnt work on its own site?
[14:54:41] <norbi> i have the images apearing and just after that it starts again
[14:54:43] <byteme_> all the service says is to not change any of the names
[14:54:49] <norbi> on its own site it works
[14:54:55] <norbi> for me it doesnt

But if the they accidently move out side the text box and hit the back button on the keyboard to delete text, it closes the light box and I have prevent that, So I maybe i need to disable the back button on keyboard when they are not in that text box? or what?
[15:09:13] <pr0ton> no
[15:09:18] <pr0ton> it needs some info from page X
[15:09:46] <norbi> eddiemonge: i cant figure out what can be the problem

[15:34:15] <coldhead> byteme_: you can send whatever format the server understands
[15:34:26] <coldhead> JSON is a good choice because it's widely used
[15:34:44] <coldhead> but it can be XML or something you invent
[15:34:55] <byteme_> only info I have from the service coldhead is to not change their code
[15:35:01] <ThePeach> hi all
[15:35:18] <coldhead> that is not well documented >: |
[15:35:21] <byteme_> meaning they expect id,value pair?
[15:35:30] <byteme_> all I have to work with at the moment :)
[15:35:31] <coldhead> maybe!
[15:35:50] <byteme_> its just a newsletter service...fairly common
[15:36:00] <ThePeach> I'm trying to find a way to run a callback after animate() that should run only once (considering the selector grabs several nodes), any suggestions?
[15:36:00] <coldhead> so probably json or xml
[15:36:04] <coldhead> hopefully <3
[15:36:58] <nym> does anyone have a recommendation for a datatable?
[15:37:15] <BrandonZacharie> ThePeach: do you have a code example?
[15:37:19] <nym> n/m http://stackoverflow.com/questions/159025/jquery-grid-recommendations
[15:38:06] <ThePeach> BrandonZacharie: not really, it's something like $("div").animate({'left': '+=100'}, callback);
[15:38:23] <sonotos> nym: http://flexigrid.info/ maybe
[15:38:23] <coldhead> nym: they all suck in one way or another :(

[15:39:27] <paul_uk> hi all.  just checking out the new financial times app for ipad and iphone which uses html5.  It's not an actual app.  I'm really digging it.  Anyone know what they used to develop it?  Jquery mobile perhaps?
[15:39:28] <BrandonZacharie> ThePeach: what exactly is the challenge you are facing? is for callabck firing more than once? as in once for each element?
[15:39:35] <coldhead> my point is mostly Lower your expectations
[15:40:10] <ThePeach> BrandonZacharie: yes
[15:43:12] <BrandonZacharie> ThePeach: perhaps you could do something like (function($elems){ var hasFired = false;  $elements.animate({...}, function(){ if (hasFired) return; alert('once!');  })  })($('div,span,a,foobar'))
[15:44:02] <BrandonZacharie> ThePeach: you'd have to put code in place to set the scoped var 'hasFired' to false at some point
[15:45:41] <BrandonZacharie> ThePeach: forgive the typo... '$elems' should be '$elements'
[15:47:40] <norbi> is there any event before loading graphics?

[15:56:35] <babonk> can you get and sett attributes on <A>?  I'm getting error on my $("#linkid").attr() call
[15:56:43] <RobW> is there anything in jquery that can auto calculate LI's widths for a menu?
[15:56:50] <babonk> Error: a.getAttribute is not a function
[15:56:50] <babonk> Source File: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.min.js
[15:56:50] <babonk> Line: 16
[15:58:08] <RobW> babonk: make sure the element exists
[15:58:16] <babonk> RobW: if it does am I good?
[15:58:26] <RobW> and since it looks like you're calling it by its ID, make sure only one ID exists, otherwise use class name
[15:58:54] <babonk> the id is definitely unique.  when a change link is clicked i call a function which does if (!$(this).attr('disabled'))
[15:59:33] <babonk> $(this) will pass to the function, right?
[15:59:56] <RobW> depends
[16:00:00] <RobW> can you paste code
[16:00:03] <babonk> sure
[16:00:49] <babonk> http://pastebin.com/1sZhSb1r

[16:01:37] <babonk> with those ids
[16:02:32] <datarecall> in jquery how would you select a div inside a div #showingform.#message
[16:02:52] <datarecall> basically i want to select #message inside form#showingform
[16:03:15] <babonk> $("#showingform").find("#message")
[16:03:15] <datarecall> but there are div id #message since there are many forms in the page
[16:03:29] <RobW> ok
[16:03:31] <babonk> I think that should work (n00b here though)
[16:03:33] <datarecall> $('#message').slideDown('slow');
[16:03:34] <RobW> babonk: you have to pass $(this)
[16:03:36] <RobW> into the function
[16:03:42] <datarecall> but i need to specify showingform
[16:03:45] <babonk> RobW:  how  come?
[16:03:50] <RobW> because that's outside the stack
[16:03:53] <babonk> $("#showingform").find("#message").slideDown('slow');
[16:04:04] <RobW> like this.. change_campus(true, $(this));
[16:04:07] <babonk> RobW: alright.  i thought this was best on whichever selector youre in?
[16:04:13] <babonk> $(this)
[16:04:13] <RobW> then function change_campus(optional, elem)
[16:04:22] <RobW> if you're in that functions, yes
[16:04:42] <babonk> so as soon as you call a function not inside the selector your this selector is gone?
[16:05:19] <RobW> babonk: here http://pastebin.com/VncjfiqT
[16:05:38] <RobW> babonk: it doesn't matter on selector, its in the anonymous function
[16:05:41] <RobW> i can't think of the proper wording
[16:05:53] <babonk> ok
[16:06:02] <babonk> i  might as well just put that if inside the event
[16:07:08] <paul_uk> hey all.  If anyone knows, please let me know :)   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6286243/what-tech-developed-the-ft-web-app-for-iphone-ipad
[16:14:24] <drMike_> hello, I've got a rather long selector: $("#calendar .fc-grid td:not(.fc-other-month)").eq(day - 1).  Is there anyway I can assign this to a variable for cleaner reuse ?
[16:15:13] <Phrogz> drMike_: Selectors are strings. You can concatenate strings in JavaScript.
[16:15:21] <Oli``> I've got a list of headers between H2 and H3 with p elements interspersed between the headers. I'm trying to make it so when you click a H3, it hides all the elements up until the next header. I've used $(this).nextUntil('h3').toggle(); and that works if the next header is a H3 but if it's a H2, it hides the H2 too. Is there a way I can specify multiple types of element in nextUntil?
[16:15:48] <drMike_> so, turn "irc://irc.freenode.net/#calendar .fc-grid td:not(.fc-other-month)" into a string?
[16:16:02] <Phrogz> Oli``: Have you tried      .nextUntil('h2,h3')  ? It might just work.
[16:16:03] <drMike_> lol, that irc part shouldn't be there
[16:16:10] * drMike_ blamed his client
[16:16:26] <RobW> drMike_: I was wondering wtf :p
[16:16:29] <raRaRa> Pure human error!
[16:16:30] <Phrogz> drMike_: var foo = "#calendar .fc-grid ..."
[16:16:32] <drMike_> hehe yea.
[16:16:35] <Oli``> Phrogz: Damn. That works! Thank you!
[16:17:05] <drMike_> I'll have to do $(foo).eq(day - 1)
[16:18:27] <Phrogz> drMike_: Well, or you could use the (slower) sizzle selectors for eq in your selector.
[16:18:43] <drMike_> sizzle? example?
[16:18:51] <Phrogz> http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[16:19:12] <Phrogz> Oh, but what's "day"? A constant or...?
[16:19:57] <asadpakistani> getJSON is not working on local domain domain?
[16:20:11] <drMike_> $(foo:eq(day-1)) ?
[16:20:22] <Phrogz> drMike_: Or you could go crazy: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/06/jquery-custom-selectors-with-parameters.html
[16:20:47] <Phrogz> drMike_: No, more like $(foo+":eq("+(day-1)+")");
[16:21:19] <drMike_> ah right, separate string from integer evaluation.
[16:22:35] <NickASloan> is there an easy way to get the form which an input belongs to with jquery? I'm doing this in the context of a change even callback
[16:23:35] <drMike_> thanks a lot Phrogz
[16:23:37] <Phrogz> NickASloan: HTML form elements have a .form property pointing to their owning form element.
[16:23:51] * drMike_ is mainly into backend/app dev (Rails/PHP)
[16:24:19] <NickASloan> Phrogz: I thought so, but how do I get the element object from $(this)?
[16:24:43] <Phrogz> var $this = $(this); var el = $this[0];
[16:25:05] <Phrogz> `.get()
[16:25:14] <Phrogz> Man, I never remember the bot triggers.
[16:25:16] <Phrogz> ?get()
[16:25:16] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[16:25:20] <Phrogz> There we go.
[16:26:11] <melvinram> I know this is a dumb question, but what is the best jquery carousel? I know, i know... it depends... what I'm looking to do is something very similar to the effect of http://sortfolio.com/
[16:26:47] <melvinram> Is there a consensus in the community on what most people use?
[16:27:16] <melvinram> PS: I did Google the shit out of this and I've come up with a list of maybe 6 options
[16:29:08] <djQuery> melvinram: in that case I typicaly go with the one that is documented best
[16:29:57] <melvinram> djQuery: so there isn't one that an experienced person would leap for as default?
[16:32:41] <Phrogz> I don't have cause to use carousels often enough to pick one out as my favorite.
[16:33:41] <heatxsink> weird question in webkit is there a onsuccess event for the img tag?
[16:33:49] <heatxsink> or like onload or something
[16:34:02] <ElGoorf> guh
[16:34:16] <ElGoorf> noob question i cant find in the api docs, how do i grab the id of the element being hovered?
[16:36:22] <Phrogz> heatxsink: What is the 'success' indicating? Onload?
[16:36:34] <heatxsink> yes nods
[16:36:41] <djQuery> ElGoorf: this.id?
[16:36:47] <ElGoorf> that simple?
[16:36:47] <heatxsink> i was just trying to detect when an image is loaded in a img tag
[16:36:47] <ElGoorf> ty
[16:37:03] <Phrogz> heatxsink: Just set the onload handler before you set the .src
[16:37:41] <Phrogz> heatxsink: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4776670/should-setting-an-image-src-to-dataurl-be-available-immediately
[16:38:05] <d4rklit3> $("#categories .options")  this is valid right?
[16:38:22] <Phrogz> d4rklit3: Syntactially for JS and CSS/Sizzle selectors, yet.
[16:38:25] <Phrogz> er, yes.
[16:38:34] <d4rklit3> ok
[16:39:02] <Phrogz> d4rklit3: Whether or not it's correct depends on if you meant to find a single item with the id of 'categories' and then find all descendant elements of any type with CSS class 'options' applied.
[16:39:28] <d4rklit3> in the id categories there is a div with the class options
[16:40:20] <roshanpatel27> hey guys
[16:41:26] <Maletor> What am I doing wrong here? https://gist.github.com/1015731
[16:41:41] <Maletor> I need to grab the lat and lon in a variable...
[16:46:34] <NickASloan> so it seems that pressing enter in an alert box that pops up triggers the key* events of the input that has focus as well.
[16:47:04] <NickASloan> am I doing something stupid to make that happen? can I make that not happen?
[16:49:20] <kflorence> what does it mean if element.elements is truthy but returns nothing with a typeof check
[16:50:27] <amid_hasan> how do you make a a drop down box dependent on another dropdown box where the data is being pulled from json?
[16:51:16] <Phrogz> amid_hasan: 10 years old school: http://phrogz.net/tmp/selpopulate.html
[16:51:21] <Phrogz> And http://phrogz.net/tmp/selpopulate2.html
[16:52:56] <roshanpatel27> Hey guys, I'm new to jquery. I'm trying to trigger an event that is defined at the very beginning of my script. Here is an excerpt fully commented to explain the situation http://jsfiddle.net/fcgJA/1/. I can explain further if needed. :)
[16:53:31] <amid_hasan> Phrogz: so the dependency is based on the name of the <option></option>?
[16:53:35] <amid_hasan> *attribute
[16:53:41] <amid_hasan> name attribute
[16:54:05] <Phrogz> amid_hasan: I dunno, let me look at my super-old code and cringe.
[16:54:21] <amid_hasan> What's the new school approach? lol
[16:54:47] <amid_hasan> I'm trying to emulate the dropdown dependency that's on www.zocdoc.com
[16:55:18] <Phrogz> amid_hasan: No, it's based on the value of the option to determine what option is selected. It's 'just coding'. a) Detect when the select has changed. b) Determine which option is selected. c) Figure out what new options you want. d) Change the options to match.
[16:55:46] <Phrogz> Which step above are you having trouble thinking how to accomplish? Or had you not gotten to the part of breaking down your problem into bite-sized steps?
[16:56:17] <amid_hasan> Phrogz: I can break it down. Thank you for explaining this thoroughly
[16:56:33] <amid_hasan> :P
[16:56:35] <Phrogz> amid_hasan: Do you need to load your new options on-demand, AJAX style, or can you load them with the page?
[16:56:41] <Phrogz> (Another aspect to consider.)
[16:56:59] <amid_hasan> Phrogz: I can hard-code them in, but I would like to AJAX the values in
[17:06:11] <kataire> Is there a way to keep linebreaks in textareas? $(textarea).text() seems to remove them.
[17:06:54] <d4rklit3> is there a way to get jquery to print a stracktrace
[17:06:59] <Phrogz> kataire: textarea.value
[17:07:11] <d4rklit3> i have a n error but it points to some internal jquery class
[17:07:17] <kataire> Phrogz: You're right. It's prop('value'), though.
[17:07:20] <d4rklit3> doesn't tell me what the problem is
[17:07:21] <Phrogz> Abuse of jQuery methods by those who don't need the guarded behavior will be the death of  us all.
[17:07:40] <Phrogz> kataire: No, I'm talking about pure DOM attribute.
[17:08:00] <kataire> Phrogz: I'm talking about 1.6. There is no $().value()
[17:08:18] <Phrogz> kataire: I'm talking about $()[0].value. No jQuery involved at all.
[17:08:20] <kataire> Phrogz: You were right, though.,
[17:08:22] <kataire> Ah
[17:08:30] <kataire> Well, prop delegates to that anyway ;)
[17:08:37] <Phrogz> You could do the .val() if you wanted.
[17:08:50] <Phrogz> ?val()
[17:08:50] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:09:23] <NickASloan> here is a test case for the problem I'm having.
[17:09:24] <NickASloan> http://jsfiddle.net/KgGpB/
[17:09:58] <NickASloan> I want to prevent the enter keystroke that a user would use to dismiss the alert to NOT trigger #whatever's keyup event.
[17:11:41] <roshanpatel27> do you have to define the id you'd like an event for?
[17:11:58] <Phrogz> NickASloan: .keyup(function(e){ ... e.preventDefault(); })
[17:12:25] <roshanpatel27> whoops, do you have to define the id you'd like an event for before you define the event itself
[17:13:30] <Phrogz> NickASloan: Or e.stopPropagation(); I'm barely reading your questino.
[17:13:42] <Maletor> What am I doing wrong here? https://gist.github.com/1015731
[17:14:52] <NickASloan> Phrogz: neither of those seem to work
[17:15:24] <NickASloan> thanks for the suggestions anyway.
[17:20:55] <computer2000> how can i check whether a class exists within a certain element tree? i want to hide an entire div if it somewhere contains an element with a certain class. pls help
[17:22:13] <d4rklit3> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[17:22:16] <d4rklit3> computer2000:
[17:23:35] <computer2000> d4rklit3: looks like :has() could be the right one. thx
[17:23:40] <d4rklit3> i think it works like this:  $("#elementTree[attr='value'])
[17:25:52] <tkon> is this post from 2008 still correct http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191881/serializing-to-json-in-jquery ? it says that you can't serialize javascript objects to JSON using jQuery, and I don't know if that's still true
[17:38:02] <bobbobbins> hey, i have in my head how i want this plugin im building to work, but im having a hard time actually making it happen....basically it goes $("#myDiv").myPlugin('myWidget'); and that will display my widget in that div...but i want if there are no arguments to call an init call that will go through the divs in the page and put widgets in them if they have the class of the widget associated with it...does that make se
[17:38:02] <bobbobbins> nse?
[17:38:06] <bobbobbins> any idea how to do that properly?
[17:38:41] <NickASloan> tkon: last time I checked, jQuery did not have a JSON serializer
[17:38:51] <NickASloan> and that was fairly recently
[17:42:26] <sor3nsen> bobbo: cant you just check if no options were passed in an if statement?
[17:42:48] <sor3nsen> and then run your $('.pluginClass').plugin()
[17:42:50] <sor3nsen> ?
[17:43:42] <bobbobbins> sor3nsen: yeah i think so, i think im overthinking the whole thing
[17:44:30] <sor3nsen> i think so, it sounds pretty simple
[17:44:37] <eddiemonge> ?tojson
[17:44:38] <bot-t> eddiemonge, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[17:44:42] <sor3nsen> just got a brain block goin on
[17:46:05] <eddiemonge> doesnt something like this work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191881/serializing-to-json-in-jquery/2855796#2855796
[17:46:40] <tkon> NickASloan:  thanks!
[17:47:14] <tkon> eddiemonge: i'm guessing that solution works, it just sounds weird to me that jquery wouldn't already have a JSON serializer built in
[17:47:35] <d4rklit3> why cant js be cool like php
[17:47:38] <eddiemonge> tkon you normall dont send json to the server. you get it from it
[17:47:48] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, ive found its cooler
[17:48:00] <d4rklit3> yeah but i have to make new Array()
[17:48:02] <d4rklit3> and check
[17:48:04] <d4rklit3> everytime
[17:48:05] <ColKurtz> GAT DAMN I LOVE FIXING BUGS
[17:48:26] <sor3nsen> d4rk: what u just say???
[17:48:27] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3, check what?
[17:48:28] <sor3nsen> :O
[17:48:35] <d4rklit3> mb im doing ti wrong
[17:48:41] <d4rklit3> but im trying to make some arrays all dynamic
[17:48:53] <eddiemonge> dynamic like how?
[17:48:57] <Rahly> js arrays are dynamic by nature
[17:49:02] <d4rklit3> so in php i can just declare an array by assigning a value (e.g.  $dude['yo'] = "sup"
[17:49:09] <d4rklit3> and bam i have an associative array
[17:49:13] <sor3nsen> yep
[17:49:15] <tkon> eddiemonge: i thought when you used $.post, data had to be in JSON form
[17:49:17] <d4rklit3> in js i can't do that
[17:49:18] <tkon> am i wrong?
[17:49:24] <sor3nsen> uh, i thought you could
[17:49:40] <Rahly> if you defined it
[17:49:49] <eddiemonge> tkon, it serializes it but to query string param format
[17:49:53] <Rahly> var x = {};   x['yo'] = 'sup';
[17:49:59] <sor3nsen> you could just use an object
[17:50:00] <sor3nsen> yeah
[17:50:15] <Rahly> or x.yo = 'sup';
[17:51:07] <bobbobbins> Can someone take a look at this...im sure the solution is really simple...i want to pass the data returned from the getJSON call to the appropriate method, but its saying it is undefined: http://pastebin.com/PiH33g1b
[17:51:11] <eddiemonge> ?eval var x.yo = 'sup'; x.yo;
[17:51:12] <bot-t> eddiemonge: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[17:51:29] <d4rklit3> inData = {};  inData[inputs_t[i].value].push(texts_t[i]);
[17:51:35] <d4rklit3> inData[inputs_t[i].value] is undefined
[17:51:38] <Rahly> although, the trouble comes when js has obj/arr, but php doesn't know the difference
[17:51:46] <Rahly> yes
[17:52:14] <Rahly> because you need to do  inData[input_t[i].value] = new Array();  then you can do your push
[17:52:28] <Rahly> :P
[17:52:32] <sor3nsen> you could just use... node...
[17:52:33] <sor3nsen> :D
[17:52:40] <sor3nsen> so glad to have left php behind
[17:52:45] <d4rklit3> see
[17:52:52] <d4rklit3> but then if it already exists
[17:52:55] <d4rklit3> it will overwrite
[17:52:58] <d4rklit3> which isn't what i want
[17:53:06] <sor3nsen> i dont think its propor to write new Array in JS
[17:53:08] <sor3nsen> unless u mean php
[17:53:19] <Rahly> its proper
[17:53:20] <d4rklit3> doesnt matter
[17:53:25] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, its saying what is undefined?
[17:53:26] <d4rklit3> new Array() = [];
[17:53:27] <sor3nsen> i dont think crockford would do it
[17:53:37] <Rahly> you can use both
[17:53:48] <Rahly> Array is a prototype in js, you can new it
[17:53:49] <sor3nsen> var something = [];
[17:53:50] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: in the init method it is saying data is undefined
[17:53:54] <sor3nsen> is more declarative
[17:54:08] <sor3nsen> same with object, var thing = {};
[17:54:11] <sor3nsen> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
[17:54:28] <Rahly> you can do  if( !inData[input_t[i].data]) inData[input_t[i].data] = new Array();
[17:54:28] <d4rklit3> i just like how i php i don't need to declare it
[17:54:36] <d4rklit3> it will make it if it isn't there or use it
[17:54:38] <Rahly> i use that a lot
[17:54:45] <sor3nsen> it should be the same in JS, or close
[17:54:52] <d4rklit3> yeah Rahly thats my problem, and why i said js isn't as cool
[17:54:53] <Rahly> yeah, but you could blow away stuff too
[17:55:04] <sor3nsen> i would say JS is far more elegant than PHP
[17:55:10] <Rahly> php is terrible because its unsafe
[17:55:19] <sor3nsen> if you use it unsafely...
[17:55:22] <d4rklit3> well
[17:55:24] <d4rklit3> php and js
[17:55:29] <sor3nsen> thats like saying sex is unsafe
[17:55:32] <sor3nsen> but wait, condoms?
[17:55:33] <d4rklit3> hahahaaaa
[17:55:34] <sor3nsen> :P
[17:55:34] <Rahly> are 2 different beasts
[17:55:41] <Rahly> ones OO, and ones prototype
[17:55:43] <d4rklit3> sex IS unsafe
[17:55:45] <d4rklit3> thats why we do it
[17:55:49] <d4rklit3> for the thrill
[17:56:08] <Rahly> and still sex isn't appropriate at work :P
[17:56:13] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, thats because its not. you cant assign it before its declared
[17:56:16] <sor3nsen> lol
[17:56:21] <d4rklit3> Rahly: only if u get caught
[17:56:26] <d4rklit3> and alos only if its with another
[17:56:27] <sor3nsen> crockford is very much against saying 'new' anything
[17:56:33] <sor3nsen> and i go with what he says
[17:56:36] <tkon> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/LH9RFqDA ... If I wanted to POST an array of these objects using $.post, how would I do that?Â  Â I thought I needed to make my variable for "data" be JSON
[17:56:38] <sor3nsen> for some... odd... reason...
[17:56:39] <d4rklit3> who is crockford
[17:56:44] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: its declared in the callback for getJSON, function(data){}
[17:56:55] <Rahly> no, even if you don't get caught, its still not appropriate :P
[17:57:04] <Rahly> i'm not talking about getting in trouble :P
[17:57:22] <sor3nsen> senior JS dev at yahoo
[17:57:25] <sor3nsen> made JSLint
[17:57:27] <Rahly> and stds will f*ck ya in the long run
[17:57:28] <eddiemonge> tkon, if its an object, then just pass it directly: $.post(url, object)
[17:57:39] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, but not at the time its defined
[17:57:56] <Rahly> personally, i wish php had proper context scoping
[17:57:58] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: im not following
[17:58:16] <sor3nsen> i was slightly sad to leave PHP, just had made a kickass Kohana modules
[17:58:23] <Rahly> php forces you to pollute the global namespace to do just about anything
[17:58:25] <sor3nsen> but node.js is mad crazy
[17:58:39] <sor3nsen> uh, theres alot of ways around that
[17:58:48] <sor3nsen> esp since php 5.3 allows namespacing
[17:59:25] <sor3nsen> and you dont need namespacing to NOT pollute if im remembering right
[17:59:32] <Rahly> and that kinda works
[17:59:52] <Rahly> it was literally hacked in, and their use if backspace makes me shudder
[17:59:58] <sor3nsen> but, its already polluted like fuck
[18:00:05] <sor3nsen> backslash?
[18:00:06] <Rahly> yes
[18:00:10] <robrobbins> arg, i got booted
[18:00:19] <sor3nsen> well, if you have a choice
[18:00:21] <sor3nsen> stop using PHP?
[18:00:35] <sor3nsen> or use something like CI or Kohana and stop caring
[18:00:44] <eddiemonge> although creating global vars in php isnt as intensive as it is in js
[18:00:48] <robrobbins> eddiemonge: so how do i get data to pass to the method properly?
[18:00:53] <Rahly> yeah, namespace My\New\Module { };
[18:01:04] <Rahly> looks ridiculous
[18:02:19] <Rahly> actually, i wouldn't mind, a real mod_js for apache
[18:02:41] <Rahly> and i still use mod_perl for all my php sites, because it provides 1000x the power
[18:02:56] <tkon> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/e4nu1huW ...It's POSTing this though when I just pass it directly, and I don't think my python backend can handle that
[18:03:00] <eddiemonge> ugh i hate pastebin. last one im looking at there. robrobbins http://pastebin.com/PSnSjekU
[18:03:00] <sor3nsen> lol, i think its just an ugly look though
[18:03:04] <sor3nsen> its not like it really matters
[18:03:26] <sor3nsen> eddie: http://pastie.org
[18:03:29] <sor3nsen> i like it alot more
[18:03:33] <sor3nsen> or make a gist
[18:03:42] <robrobbins> eddiemonge; oh...thanks! i knew i was missing something simple
[18:03:44] <Rahly> lol
[18:03:52] <Rahly> i prefer GiST
[18:03:59] <sor3nsen> same
[18:04:09] <sor3nsen> big github fan i am tho
[18:04:10] <Rahly> postgresql for the win
[18:04:19] <robrobbins> what should i use instead of pastebin?
[18:04:33] <sor3nsen> pastie.org
[18:04:39] <sor3nsen> github.com
[18:04:41] <sor3nsen> either one
[18:04:52] <sor3nsen> first is quick and dirty, second is a bit more legit
[18:04:55] <eddiemonge> sor3nsen, jsfiddle.net is my choice
[18:05:10] <eddiemonge> Rahly, you are banished
[18:05:13] <sor3nsen> ah, thats a different paradigm?
[18:05:17] <Rahly> lol for?
[18:05:18] <jordan_> http://holdemhelpem.com/nbn/Nightly-Business-News-Summary-2009-4Q.html
[18:05:39] <sor3nsen> jsfiddle is pretty specific
[18:05:46] <sor3nsen> and not really a good solution
[18:05:51] <Rahly> jsfiddle is nice though
[18:05:54] <sor3nsen> agreed
[18:05:58] <sor3nsen> but can i paste PHP in it?
[18:06:08] <Rahly> umm no, its for js :P
[18:06:08] <sor3nsen> or.. ruby? python?
[18:06:11] <sor3nsen> obviously
[18:06:16] <sor3nsen> so its a different paradigm
[18:06:18] <jordan_> $.get(myPhpFile, {'url': 'http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=...'}, ProcessData);
[18:06:20] <sor3nsen> just trying to point out the obvious
[18:06:36] <sor3nsen> its been a long day...
[18:06:40] <jordan_> the data returns null, however if i put the link in the url bar manually it will return data
[18:06:41] <sor3nsen> learning python
[18:06:51] <eddiemonge> sor3nsen, yes you can paste those
[18:06:56] <eddiemonge> it wont parse them but you can
[18:07:22] <Rahly> eddiemonge: but its nice to have it properly syntax highlight them
[18:07:31] <eddiemonge> jordan_, what is that supposed to be doing?
[18:07:35] <sor3nsen> lol... >.<
[18:07:54] <jordan_> eddiemonge, it gets a bunch of stock information
[18:08:14] <Rahly> well its not going to get it, because its cross domain
[18:08:45] <jordan_> yea that's what i thought
[18:08:51] <jordan_> it works on IE7 i think
[18:08:57] <jordan_> how do i get it to wokr
[18:08:59] <tkon> eddiemonge: so you're not going to take a look at my pastebin post? you want me to use jsfiddle?
[18:09:07] <Rahly> need to either pipe it through another server, or set the origin policy
[18:09:28] <jordan_> pipe it through another server?
[18:09:47] <Rahly> yes
[18:09:48] <jordan_> what is it called cross domain script?
[18:10:04] <Rahly> have a script on a server that makes the real call, then you call that script on your server
[18:10:23] <eddiemonge> tkon, what code? i thought i answered your question
[18:10:39] <eddiemonge> jordan_, how is it suposed to do that? have you looked at the docs for that?
[18:10:42] <Rahly> i love hot wings
[18:11:06] <jordan_> eddiemonge, i had it working for IE7
[18:11:25] <Rahly> yes cross domain is a security aspect, you are talking about ie
[18:11:29] <eddiemonge> jordan_, what is myPhpFile? that should be the URL for your page. and what is processData?
[18:11:41] <jordan_> ProcessData is function
[18:11:58] <tkon> eddiemonge: you said "tkon, if its an object, then just pass it directly: $.post(url, object)" and I said "eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/e4nu1huW ...It's POSTing this though when I just pass it directly, and I don't think my python backend can handle that	"
[18:11:59] <Rahly> probably to get the return ajax
[18:11:59] <jordan_> myphpfile is http://www.holdemhelpem.com/nbn/js/get-file-contents.php
[18:12:40] <eddiemonge> tkon, your python cant handle a query string?
[18:12:59] <eddiemonge> jordan_, and the function? thats whats processing the results from that url
[18:13:08] <jordan_> yes
[18:13:59] <notjrbauer> Does anyone know if the addthis social button doesnt run in safaria iphone4
[18:14:28] <Rahly> its probably patiented
[18:14:35] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: thanks, that worked, but now if i pass a method like this $.spdi('piechart') it is saying that method doesn't exist http://pastie.org/2040545
[18:14:38] <eddiemonge> notjrbauer, thats pretty vague and maybe not jquery related
[18:14:40] <jordan_> Rahly do you mean have a script on server B that makes the real call and then on Server A I call that script
[18:14:44] <eddiemonge> jordan_, that wasnt a question
[18:14:46] <Rahly> yes
[18:14:50] <bobbobbins> arg, im so horrible at passing vars back and forth
[18:14:52] <Rahly> no
[18:14:55] <tkon> eddiemonge: well the query string has got square brackets in it, which is the same way that python represents arrays, so i expect that part to be messy
[18:15:11] <Rahly> server b script calls server a when you call the server b script
[18:15:22] <eddiemonge> tkon, i dont know how python parse stuff so i couldnt tell you but thats a python question
[18:15:24] <Rahly> because you can't call server a
[18:15:38] <eddiemonge> jordan_, is that url on your server?
[18:15:45] <jordan_> yes
[18:15:55] <eddiemonge> then you can ignore what Rahly  is saying
[18:16:32] <Rahly> huh?
[18:16:57] <jordan_> i have two scripts on my server link-stock-tickers.js and get-file-contents.php
[18:16:59] <eddiemonge> this isnt a case of sop
[18:17:35] <jordan_> link calls getfile with $.get()
[18:18:19] <Rahly> ahhh, ok, i'm use to $.ajax, it looked like you were calling http://finance.yahoo.com directly
[18:18:25] <tkon> eddiemonge: well i guess i'm brought back to this post... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191881/serializing-to-json-in-jquery/2855796 ... i'm confused why all of these people seem to think that you need to post using json, and you're telling me it's unnecessary
[18:18:52] <jordan_> Rahly no am indirectly calling it
[18:19:20] <Rahly> you get-file should call that then, you should be fine, as long as you want it cached
[18:19:25] <eddiemonge> jordan_, so whats your question again?
[18:19:27] <jordan_> does it work for you http://holdemhelpem.com/nbn/Nightly-Business-News-Summary-2009-4Q.html
[18:19:40] <jordan_> mouse over a symbol should give you info on it
[18:19:51] <jordan_> secondly are you getting an error
[18:19:59] <jordan_> the processdata is getting null data
[18:20:05] <Rahly> yeah fields is null
[18:20:20] <jordan_> yea, why is that
[18:20:54] <jordan_> it was just working a week ago, but i was using IE7 i think it was
[18:21:18] <Rahly> lines[0] contains an empty line
[18:21:36] <eddiemonge> wtf? your own server is getting sop'ed?
[18:21:45] <jordan_> sop?
[18:22:03] <eddiemonge> tkon, you dont post json. you post query param data
[18:22:03] <bobbobbins> any idea why it would say method piechart doesn't exist: http://pastie.org/2040545
[18:22:04] <Rahly> so your match is failing
[18:22:10] <eddiemonge> ?sop
[18:22:11] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[18:22:55] <Rahly> the data coming back from your php script is empty
[18:23:12] <jordan_> right it shouldn't i put in the url in the browser it gives back data
[18:23:21] <Rahly> maybe the format of the link changed? or the url changed
[18:24:14] <Rahly> but its your php script, you could make fixes though, in case your script does return invalid data
[18:24:19] <eddiemonge> Origin http://holdemhelpem.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[18:25:12] <eddiemonge> jordan_, your query string is pretty dirty looking
[18:26:01] <Rahly> heavy posting
[18:26:16] <jordan_> well it works
[18:26:18] <eddiemonge> jordan_, you really should be returning json and then parsing that
[18:26:24] <eddiemonge> i thought it doesnt work
[18:26:33] <jordan_> well i mean the link does
[18:26:39] <jordan_> if i just paste it in browser
[18:26:48] <jordan_> check it now i seperated it out into getUrl
[18:27:30] <Rahly> jordan_: http://www.holdemhelpem.com/nbn/Nightly-Business-News-Summary-2009-4Q.html works
[18:27:57] <jordan_> no
[18:27:58] <Rahly> you are ajaxing to a different domain
[18:28:09] <jordan_> no
[18:28:11] <Rahly> does for me, no error
[18:28:18] <jordan_> can you mouseover symbols
[18:28:23] <jordan_> and see data
[18:28:28] <Rahly> but no errors
[18:28:38] <Rahly> its passing the ajax
[18:28:59] <Rahly> your other errors are different
[18:29:09] <Rahly> oh
[18:29:19] <Rahly> i can, mouse over symbols and get stuff
[18:29:39] <Rahly> very bright :P
[18:30:13] <jordan_> ??
[18:30:36] <jordan_> i can't
[18:30:38] <Rahly> the bright yellow
[18:30:47] <Rahly> don't use your original link
[18:30:53] <Rahly> use the one i posted
[18:31:25] <jordan_> interesting
[18:31:28] <jordan_> how did that work
[18:32:17] <Rahly> cuz you had holdemhelpem.com, you designed the site for a different domain name
[18:32:21] <Rahly> www.holdemhelpem.com
[18:32:37] <Rahly> thats sop
[18:32:53] <jordan_> oh it's the www
[18:32:57] <Rahly> yes
[18:33:03] <Rahly> 2 different domain names
[18:34:12] <jordan_> so what do i do about that
[18:35:14] <Rahly> don't use a static url when posting?
[18:35:19] <Rahly> ala getting
[18:36:04] <eddiemonge> jordan_, you should have either www or non-www not both
[18:36:10] <jordan_> you mean in the $.get
[18:36:35] <Rahly> yes
[18:36:46] <eddiemonge> jordan_, just dont put the domain in the url.  instead of www.domain.com/page.php just do /page.php or page.php
[18:36:47] <Rahly> use something like /nbn/js/get-file-contents.php   instead
[18:36:55] <jordan_> ah i see
[18:37:25] <bobbobbins> sorry, i feel like an idiot, but now when i call a method $this doesn't seem to work anymore, can someone please take a look http://pastie.org/2040609
[18:37:30] <Rahly> by default, its going to use the location of the page, or <base>
[18:37:48] <jordan_> ok eddiemonge that did it
[18:38:59] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, stop using paste
[18:39:05] <eddiemonge> *pastie
[18:39:14] <bobbobbins> sorry...thats what someone said i should use
[18:39:22] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: whats should i use?
[18:39:49] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, there is no $(this) for a getJSON call. see ? pe
[18:39:50] <bot-t> bobbobbins, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[18:40:14] <bobbobbins> so if there is no this, how can i pass it to my method? i cant?
[18:40:18] <eddiemonge> jordan_, so Rahly was right about his sop suggestions but in the wrong way
[18:40:31] <jordan_> yup
[18:40:32] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, pass what?
[18:40:34] <roddy> does someone happen to know why $.fn.ajaxSubmit from the jQuery form plugin from http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ converts the data argument to an array before passing it to $.param() ?
[18:41:12] <Rahly> roddy: what does the code for the plugin say?
[18:41:14] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, you have to do the var $this  part above the getJSON call
[18:41:33] <bobbobbins> hmm, ok, lemmie try that
[18:41:55] <roddy> Rahly: do you mean how i'm calling it, or the plugin's code i'm pondering about?
[18:42:22] <Rahly> the latter
[18:42:26] <bobbobbins> now it says $this is not defined in init
[18:43:28] <roddy> Rahly: paste looks a bit botched, but this is it : http://pastebin.com/BL2cdY8a
[18:43:43] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, whats your code look like now?
[18:43:48] <roddy> Rahly: thing is, it botches the data I'm trying to pass - a multi-dimensional object - while $.param can handle it just fine
[18:44:16] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/UVr4q/
[18:44:31] <Rahly> its been a long time since i've posted forms
[18:45:16] <Rahly> whats with the insane amount of whitespace?
[18:45:40] <roddy> Rahly: yeah, that's what I meant by bothced paste :p sorry, i copied from vim in terminal
[18:46:25] <roddy> i could stop prefixing sentences with your name, huh :]
[18:46:39] <Rahly> weird, i never get extra whitespace from vim, you must be using a weird terminal
[18:46:46] <roddy> quite probable
[18:46:56] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:47:03] <Rahly> i'm kinda use to putty now though
[18:48:02] <Rahly> i can see how it botched it up
[18:48:11] <roddy> hrm, i'm using gnome-terminal .. should be ok
[18:48:22] <Rahly> it only takes into account arrays, not objects
[18:48:23] <roddy> perhaps i'm missing a ~/.vimrc statement
[18:49:09] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins,  something like http://jsfiddle.net/UVr4q/1/
[18:49:15] <Rahly> i'm sure where the $.param is
[18:50:03] <roddy> it doesn't make much sense to me, if you supply an object like { key : [ 1, 2, 3 ] }, it will push a 3 times to look like [ { key : 1 }, { key : 2 }, { key : 3 } ], which after $.param resolves to just key=1 .. while $.param would return key[]=1&key[]=2&key[]=3
[18:50:55] <Rahly> only php rapes the key names in parameters
[18:51:09] <Rahly> most other scripts, 3 keys are correct
[18:51:50] <Rahly> sounds like a silly plugin, you could always do it yourself
[18:53:34] <roddy> yeah, i would appreciate it more if it resolved the data to key=1&key=2&key=3, but doesn't seem to do that even
[18:54:47] <roddy> trying to remember what led me to believe that that plugin was 'the' solution to upload files with jQUery
[18:55:49] <eddiemonge> roddy, a validation plugin is the solution to uploading files?
[18:55:59] <bobbobbins> eddiemonge: it says ele.html is not a function
[18:56:08] <bobbobbins> im not following where ele comes from
[18:56:12] <roddy> is there validation in there :S? didn't even bother to look, just looking for a tiny solution
[18:56:31] <eddiemonge> bobbobbins, you need to pass it in. i think you are trying to do something harder than it needs to be
[18:56:41] <bobbobbins> yeah i think so too
[18:56:51] <Rahly> you cant upload files via javascript, because it doesn't have direct access to the files.... some browsers have the ability to access files now, but its not reliable, unless you are targeting them
[18:56:53] <roddy> but while i'm here.. what do you guys prefer for uploading files?
[18:57:12] <roddy> oh it works fine, just need to use a file input element
[18:57:34] <eddiemonge> ?uploadify
[18:57:35] <bot-t> uploadify - a multiple file upload plugin that allows the easy integration of a multiple (or single) file uploads on your website. http://www.uploadify.com
[18:57:35] <roddy> but i'm updating from jquery < 1.5 to 1.6 which renders an old plugin unusable
[18:58:02] <bobbobbins> my brain hurts
[18:58:12] <Rahly> i don't know how your js gets access to the underlying file to do uploading then
[18:58:14] <TheoMurpse> I've noticed that .change() is triggered on a dropdown when the mouse is used to change the dropdown to another value, but not when the keyboard is used. HOw can I trigger the change when the keyboard is used to change the value (i.e., using tab and up/down to navigate between form elements)
[18:58:46] <iszak> TheoMurpse, it is triggered when the keyboard is used, except it only triggers when the select loses focus.
[18:59:03] <TheoMurpse> iszak, in that case, is there a way to have it trigger even when the select still has focus?
[18:59:12] <TheoMurpse> and also trigger for mouse?
[18:59:20] <TheoMurpse> if i didn't care about the mouse, i'd just try .keyup()
[18:59:31] <TheoMurpse> Or should I do element.keyup().change()?
[18:59:39] <roddy> Rahly: there's only one way, the input element has to be submitted  .. only the user can edit the input element, and reading from the input element is very limited as well - but submitting it works in most browsers
[18:59:48] <iszak> TheoMurpse, I would just stick with the change event.
[19:00:02] <TheoMurpse> iszak, Except it absolutely does not do the behavior I want, so that's not an option.
[19:00:03] <Rahly> but you are talking about 2 requests? instead of one?
[19:00:12] <TheoMurpse> Thanks anyway.
[19:00:16] <roddy> not that I know of ;]
[19:00:19] <iszak> TheoMurpse, but it's the behaviour people expect.
[19:00:21] <TheoMurpse> And thanks for the explanation for why change() doesn't do what I expected.
[19:00:41] <TheoMurpse> iszak, I doubt it. It sure wasn't what I, a web user, not programmer, expected.
[19:00:49] <roddy> actually in the end-product there are 2 requests, 1 to validate the extension so that people don't waste their time uploading a 8mb tiff when the client only accepts png&jpg for example
[19:00:51] <Rahly> well if you are submitting, then there is no need to process the params right?
[19:01:01] <iszak> TheoMurpse, if you say so.
[19:01:10] <eddiemonge> roddy, you can fake a file extension
[19:01:13] <TheoMurpse> When I use a keyboard to change a select, that's a change. I don't expect to have to make it lose focus, too.
[19:01:19] <TheoMurpse> Oh well, you helpepd me with my rpobelm. Thanks.
[19:01:25] <roddy> i'm adding variables to the request to make the backend handle generic requests
[19:01:28] <iszak> TheoMurpse, press enter to commit the change and it should trigger the change event
[19:01:29] <TheoMurpse> *problem // Sometimes I type too fast for my own keyboard.
[19:01:40] <sor3nsen> lah
[19:01:40] <TheoMurpse> iszak, hitting enter submits the form.
[19:01:49] <roddy> eddiemonge: of course, it's just a silly check, but it's not meant as security - just as a service
[19:01:50] <sor3nsen> any of you guys used wijmo?
[19:02:11] <iszak> TheoMurpse, oh I was talking with the menu out
[19:02:37] <eddiemonge> roddy, so you want to make it take longer just for fun instead of actually doing security check?
[19:02:40] <iszak> menu/drop down list
[19:02:49] <roddy> eddiemonge: 1st request takes about 200ms
[19:03:08] <roddy> yet to hear a customer complain about that delay
[19:03:16] <TheoMurpse> iszak, Oh, I was talking about SELECT + OPTION.
[19:03:24] <roddy> of course security check can only be done when file is uploaded, precisely because JS has no access to the file
[19:03:43] <roddy> and that's a little late to say 'well, your 10mb file will be discarded now'
[19:04:06] <roddy> (which of course still will happen if subsequent checks fail)
[19:04:11] <Rahly> not technically true though
[19:04:28] <Rahly> i check files as they are uploading ,so i can cancel before they finish
[19:04:49] <eddiemonge> roddy, you cant know that for sure.
[19:04:52] <roddy> btw, this is not the issue i'm trying to resolve :]
[19:05:06] * roddy checks out uploadify - thanks eddiemonge
[19:05:07] <TheoMurpse> In any case, iszak, Thank you very much. I modified the code to do element.keyup(function(){foo();}).change(function(){foo();}); and now it works perfectly.
[19:05:39] <Rahly> just saying :P
[19:05:39] <iszak> TheoMurpse, see the thing with keydown event is it won't trigger if you bind it to the select.
[19:06:25] <TheoMurpse> Well I did $('select').keyup(blah).change(blah); and it works fine. I don't need to worry about keydown.
[19:07:23] <iszak> TheoMurpse, sorry I meant keypress, keyup seems to work
[19:07:39] <TheoMurpse> Hehe. Well thank you. Your explanation led me to a solution.
[19:07:43] <iszak> TheoMurpse, then I guess you can use change + keyup/down
[19:08:11] <TheoMurpse> Now to crack the nut of how to make a behavior happen on .change of a text input, but only after 2 seconds or so of no further change to the text input.
[19:08:30] <iszak> keydown + setTimeout
[19:08:44] <TheoMurpse> Yeah, that's what I figured would be done. I just didn't know it was called "setTimeout" Thanks!
[19:13:53] <MACscr> I need a little help traversing the DOM here: http://jsfiddle.net/xB8zW/
[19:14:16] <MACscr> basically when the move link is clicked, i want the move checkbox checked
[19:15:22] <MACscr> i thought i needed to go up two parent(), but that didnt work either
[19:20:18] <djQuery> MACscr: have you tried see ?.closest
[19:20:18] <bot-t> MACscr, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:22:02] <bobbobbins> anyone here familiar with highcharts?
[19:22:14] <djQuery> ?ask@bobbobbins
[19:22:14] <bot-t> bobbobbins, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[19:23:05] <bobbobbins> well alright then...i want to read in a chart but not display it...but if i set renderTo = null it throws an error
[19:23:38] <djQuery> then just do a .hide on it
[19:23:42] <MACscr> djQuery: i tried something like:$(this).closest('input[name=move_started]').attr('checked',Â true);, but no luck with that either
[19:24:32] <djQuery> MACscr: no $(this).closest('tr').find('input[name=move_started]').attr('checked',Â true);
[19:25:08] <bobbobbins> but i have no where to render it to anyway...so hide won't work
[19:25:10] <djQuery> .parent was the td
[19:25:39] <djQuery> .parent().parent() was the td
[19:26:19] <MACscr> djQuery: genius! Thanks!
[19:26:25] <djQuery> you were doing .children so even if you got up to the tr it wouldnt have found it becase the only children of the tr are td
[19:26:48] <MACscr> is there anything like closest that goes reverse?
[19:26:55] <hazardrix7981> hi, I'm new to jquery ui and want to use it for creating a text editor. now I have buttons who do some magic on a textarea. However it seems like if there is a request sent to the server when I click on a button, because the textarea loses focus, even though if I focus() it right when the button is clicked. Did I oversee something maybe?
[19:26:55] <djQuery> MACscr: try not to use return false so most.
[19:27:02] <djQuery> so much
[19:27:13] <djQuery> MACscr: see ?stoppropogation
[19:27:15] <bot-t> MACscr, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[19:27:50] <djQuery> MACscr: err rather in this case you want see ?preventdefault
[19:27:51] <bot-t> MACscr, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[19:27:53] <MACscr> djQuery: ah, ok. So do that instead of return false; for stopping links for actually opening in the browser?
[19:28:22] <djQuery> MACscr: yes preventdefault will do that
[19:29:05] <djQuery> but with return false the bubble of the click and the following of the link dont happen. what if you want to have the row highlighted when it was clicked
[19:29:53] <djQuery> hazardrix7981: there are plenty of plugable text editors out there allread see ?fckeditor

[19:31:06] <hazardrix7981> djQuery: I have to create my own^^
[19:32:00] <djQuery> hazardrix7981: yeah reinventing the wheel is allways fun. just love that it has to be made here mentality
[19:32:13] <hazardrix7981> djQuery: so I simply don't want the button to send any request, just calling this function ;)
[19:33:01] <djQuery> hazardrix7981: see ?p
[19:33:02] <bot-t> hazardrix7981, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[19:33:15] <djQuery> hazardrix7981: is the button in a form?
[19:33:31] <hazardrix7981> yep
[19:33:38] <hazardrix7981> that may be the problem then
[19:34:14] <djQuery> $('button').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); other stuff});
[19:34:35] <djQuery> or just dont use real buttons use fake ones and make them look like buttons
[19:34:47] <hazardrix7981> fake buttons are?
[19:34:57] <djQuery> hazardrix7981: see ?.ui.button

[19:36:26] <hazardrix7981> if it works ;)
[19:36:30] <normelton> when using jquery templating, is there some sort of callback that i can use to modify the template results after it's been created but before it's inserted into the DOM?
[19:36:56] <djQuery> normelton: you mean like I am doing here?
[19:36:56] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/aboma3/10/edit
[19:37:00] <hazardrix7981> yep, it does
[19:37:08] <hazardrix7981> djQuery: thanks for your help ;)
[19:37:30] <hazardrix7981> now I can reinvent the wheel :D
[19:38:04] <normelton> djQuery: you mean your applyTBLW() ? i suppose that would work!
[19:38:12] <normelton> just handle it outside of jquery templating
[19:38:35] <sor3nsen> people actually use jquery templating?
[19:38:37] <sor3nsen> :O
[19:38:46] <normelton> **gasp**
[19:38:56] <normelton> i'm going to give it a shot
[19:38:59] <sor3nsen> lol
[19:39:10] <sor3nsen> ive been using backbone.js/mustache.js for templating
[19:39:15] <normelton> it sure beats long strings of HTML shoehorned into a script
[19:39:17] <sor3nsen> but, i have a diferent paradigm
[19:39:40] <normelton> ahh backbone... i just spent a day or two reading about it ... at first it seemed cool, but i couldn't get over feeling like it's a lot of overhead for not a lot of gain
[19:39:53] <sor3nsen> its a huge gain if you have a complicated app
[19:39:57] <normelton> and was afraid i'd back myself into a corner case that it doesn't handle cleanly
[19:39:57] <sor3nsen> unless you like spaghetti
[19:40:06] <sor3nsen> http://sorensen.no.de
[19:40:10] <sor3nsen> is made in 100% backbone
[19:40:24] <sor3nsen> beats the hell out of the alternative
[19:40:45] <sor3nsen> which would be such unorganized code otherwise
[19:41:23] <normelton> mmm ... i could be convinced to give it a shot
[19:41:32] <sor3nsen> its an MVc for the front end
[19:41:37] <sor3nsen> which so far is non existant?
[19:41:44] <normelton> right
[19:41:46] <sor3nsen> https://github.com/sorensen/aebleskiver
[19:41:51] <sor3nsen> if you want to look at some code
[19:41:56] <sor3nsen> its a node.js project
[19:42:25] <djQuery> normelton: I havent looked at those yet how do they store the template?
[19:42:46] <sor3nsen> how does who store?
[19:42:48] <sor3nsen> or what*
[19:42:51] <normelton> djQuery: sorry, how does ... yeah that
[19:43:15] <sor3nsen> if you use templating, i suggest using underscore for it
[19:43:19] <sor3nsen> _.template()
[19:43:22] <sor3nsen> its mad easy
[19:43:26] <sor3nsen> and a very light lib
[19:43:45] <djQuery> sor3nsen: how does it store the html for the template
[19:43:49] <tbranyen> pulling in all of underscore just for templating is kind of dum
[19:43:57] <djQuery> ?underscore
[19:43:57] <bot-t> underscore.js -- http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ -- a utility library that includes functional programming paradigms, supplies cross-browser Array methods, and micro-templating.
[19:44:14] <tbranyen> jquery templating is ridiculously fast too
[19:44:21] <normelton> sor3nsen: okay, riddle me this... let's say i have a model for Car. all the examples i see for backbone are basically create/update/delete... how does it handle adding a method, say, "drive", that would post back to the server and invoke some logic, perhaps update the object, then return an updated copy?
[19:45:57] <normelton> and your chat app is pretty slick btw
[19:45:59] <sor3nsen> then its a custom function you would make the same as any other way
[19:46:09] <sor3nsen> but at least its assigned to a model or a veiw
[19:46:21] <sor3nsen> model.drive(there)
[19:46:29] <sor3nsen> and make your same logic, but now its organized
[19:46:34] <sor3nsen> i use dnode and mongoose
[19:46:38] <sor3nsen> node.js libs
[19:46:45] <sor3nsen> which is socket.io and mongodb abstractions
[19:47:02] <sor3nsen> so i would just make matching functions on client/server to do what i need to simple as pie
[19:47:08] <normelton> i hadn't seen mongoose, looks interesting
[19:47:18] <sor3nsen> if you use node.js/mongodb thats the bees knees
[19:47:39] <sor3nsen> my latest package i'm working on is a utility to combine dnode/mongoose/backbone
[19:47:46] <sor3nsen> which is contained in the chat app
[19:47:50] <sor3nsen> i just need to extract it
[19:48:46] <sor3nsen> it really depends on your app
[19:48:55] <sor3nsen> if you have a small ammount of jquery anyway, you probably dont need the overhead
[19:49:06] <sor3nsen> if you start having a ton, and want to organize it, then backbone is a good lib
[19:49:12] <djQuery> sor3nsen: seeing as how I am a .net programer having all those <%= %> in the templates would screw with me
[19:49:30] <normelton> sor3nsen: right
[19:49:31] <sor3nsen> yeah i dont use those ever?
[19:49:36] <sor3nsen> mustache.js ftw
[19:49:40] <sor3nsen> {{sup}}
[19:50:02] <sor3nsen> i dont like ejs templating
[19:50:07] <cgcardona> in this example http://pastebin.com/UnyCbupp at line 32 I have an array that contains the path to all of the songs. How can I get access to that array from the play() function without creating a global variable? I considered return but I'm not sure how to implement it
[19:50:07] <djQuery> with tempalates its just ${sup}
[19:50:08] <sor3nsen> which i think jquery templating is using by default?
[19:50:18] <sor3nsen> kinda worse
[19:50:22] <sor3nsen> imho
[19:50:29] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: yeah i've been working on something similar to mustache, but smaller code more portable code
[19:50:32] <tbranyen> and way faster
[19:50:41] <sor3nsen> which is what
[19:50:48] <sor3nsen> or something your creating?
[19:50:49] <tbranyen> wip
[19:50:51] <tbranyen> ya
[19:50:54] <sor3nsen> gotcha
[19:51:00] <sor3nsen> reinventing the wheel?
[19:51:04] <sor3nsen> mustache is crazy portable
[19:51:20] <sor3nsen> one step further is handlebars
[19:51:22] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: mustache doesn't have a lot of features
[19:51:27] <sor3nsen> one step back is markdown
[19:51:29] <tbranyen> handlebars takes things way out of control
[19:51:34] <tbranyen> and is only js
[19:51:36] <sor3nsen> it shouldnt have alot of features, its a template
[19:51:42] <sor3nsen> less is more
[19:51:56] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: wrong, iterating object structures is kind of crucial
[19:51:57] <sor3nsen> but thats kinda my style
[19:51:59] <tbranyen> and mustache cannot do
[19:52:13] <sor3nsen> i thought it can
[19:52:23] <tbranyen> can't get key val of nested object structures
[19:52:24] <sor3nsen> your logic should not be in templates, mustache can do conditions and loops
[19:52:32] <sor3nsen> at least i thought
[19:52:35] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: that statement is quite contradictory
[19:52:46] <sor3nsen> not really
[19:52:47] <tbranyen> logical shouldn't be in templates, mustache can do logic
[19:52:50] <tbranyen> logic*
[19:53:10] <sor3nsen> thats not really true 'logic'
[19:53:25] <sor3nsen> from the perspective of crunching data/numbers ect
[19:53:30] <sor3nsen> calculations
[19:53:32] <tbranyen> ummm if conditionals are the very foundation of logic
[19:53:32] <tbranyen> hehe
[19:53:38] <sor3nsen> i realize
[19:53:48] <sor3nsen> but if you have done higher level programming than that i think you understand
[19:53:55] <sor3nsen> and are just being the devil's advocate
[19:54:04] <tbranyen> no i'm just confused as to why you keep contradicting
[19:54:12] <sor3nsen> sigh
[19:54:24] <sor3nsen> look at it a little more abstractly i guess
[19:54:25] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: here this might help: https://gist.github.com/994418
[19:54:36] <tbranyen> find something that matches all that and save me some trouble
[19:55:04] <sor3nsen> ok, mustache.js
[19:55:06] <sor3nsen> ?
[19:55:13] <sor3nsen> or how about, jade.js
[19:55:24] <tbranyen> jade.js doesn't match any of those requirements
[19:55:29] <tbranyen> except for maybe filters
[19:55:35] <tbranyen> mustache.js doesn't have chainable filters
[19:55:38] <tbranyen> or hooks
[19:55:46] <sor3nsen> looking at your demo html code
[19:55:50] <Steedle> anyone have a simple jquery script that will use a button to change the font and background images of a certain div
[19:56:00] <sor3nsen> i think you are going above and beyond what templates should do
[19:56:05] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: how so?
[19:56:10] <sor3nsen> why doesnt the code that supplies the template data do that?
[19:56:23] <tbranyen> do what?
[19:56:29] <sor3nsen> its not the templates responsibility to filter
[19:56:36] <sor3nsen> its the suppliers job
[19:56:41] <sor3nsen> brb
[19:56:41] <tbranyen> of course not and as you can see the filters are not defined in the template
[19:56:51] <tbranyen> they are defined in the backend
[19:57:02] <tbranyen> as they are in virtually every template implementation that has filters
[19:58:23] <djQuery> tbranyen: think tmpl has everything u are looking for there except the filters
[19:58:33] <tbranyen> djQuery: and portability :-/
[19:58:40] <tbranyen> since it uses new Function()
[19:59:26] <tbranyen> filters a huge deal imo, it gives you a lot of power to be specific and separate code from content
[20:00:58] <tbranyen> also djQuery tmpl relies on jquery
[20:01:04] <tbranyen> which makes it kind of massive
[20:01:18] <tbranyen> although the node implementation doesn't
[20:03:28] <coldhead> OMG NOO GITHUB IS OFFLINEEE
[20:03:36] <normelton> haha yes i just noticed that too
[20:03:56] <coldhead> WE'RE DOOOMMED
[20:04:01] <bobbobbins> ok, so heres my script: http://jsfiddle.net/CU4Aq/ it works ok but the method is doing a return so that i can use $this, i'd rather do this in the method, how do i do that?
[20:04:05] <luxigo> cardona: with return this.each(..... you return "this", thats normal jQuery style .... from inside the each you can return false to stop processing the elements list matching the selector ... you must use a global or pass a reference to an object
[20:06:14] <luxigo> cardona: but since your global will be in your closure, it will not be really a global..
[20:06:20] <bobbobbins> i was told it should be very simple, but i can't seem to get this(this being my div) to be usable in my methods
[20:07:00] <luxigo> cgcardona: oops
[20:08:38] <Rahly> divs are fun
[20:08:45] <cgcardona> luxigo: i defined the `var song = new Array()` outside of the init method so that the play method could see it. But now when i call the play method it logs an empty array to the console, Any idea why it wouldn't see the items that were pushed into the array in init?
[20:09:43] <cgcardona> ah i got it
[20:09:52] <cgcardona> i was redeclaring the songs var in the init funciton
[20:10:44] <bobbobbins> any help? sorry to keep asking, but its bugging the crap out of me
[20:11:02] <Rahly> 1+2?
[20:11:42] <luxigo> cgcardona: you could also define it in init() and return songs instead of this
[20:13:05] <luxigo> cgcardona: removin "return" from "return this.each(..." and addin "return songs;" at the bottom
[20:14:11] <luxigo> cgcardona: then pass songs as a parameter to play()
[20:15:01] <sor3nsen> asdf
[20:15:04] <sor3nsen> shit got distracted
[20:15:39] <sor3nsen> i guess i just dont understand why the filters are apart of the template itself
[20:15:42] <sor3nsen> or the package
[20:15:46] <sor3nsen> unless i'm missing something
[20:16:13] <sor3nsen> in my case i would use backbone to do all my filter/sorts/conditionals
[20:16:26] <sor3nsen> and then supply the direct content to the template
[20:16:39] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: not everyone working on templates is a programmer
[20:16:44] <tbranyen> in fact thats one of the great reasons to use templates
[20:16:53] <tbranyen> when you are working with designers
[20:17:09] <tbranyen> providing them the filters they need allows them to be creative
[20:17:13] <tbranyen> without affecting the system
[20:17:16] <sor3nsen> or do someone elses job
[20:17:19] <luxigo> cgcardona: but it would be better to define a class the normal way, the way you call your methods is strange...
[20:17:27] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: this isn't new...
[20:17:33] <tbranyen> i'm not making this up here
[20:17:36] <tbranyen> its how websites get made
[20:17:40] <sor3nsen> its a bit of a seperation of concerns, and i understand what your saying
[20:18:03] <sor3nsen> if i have a designer for UI/UX, all i need are mockups, or PSD's
[20:18:12] <sor3nsen> its a very good workflow
[20:18:27] <tbranyen> okay that stops working when you have a team of 30 people
[20:18:34] <tbranyen> and horrible communication
[20:18:42] <tbranyen> its easier to separate the concerns as much as possible
[20:18:47] <sor3nsen> i think it works better imho, since i do work with a team of 30 people and thats the process
[20:19:00] <sor3nsen> but, every situation is different
[20:19:04] <sor3nsen> i'm not knocking you in anyway
[20:19:13] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: again i'm not inventing this
[20:19:15] <tbranyen> it already exists
[20:19:18] <tbranyen> even in mustache
[20:19:18] <sor3nsen> i realize
[20:19:20] <tbranyen> which you keep touting
[20:19:22] <tbranyen> i don't think you do
[20:19:35] <sor3nsen> i might be biased since i can do both?
[20:19:45] <sor3nsen> so i might not always see the line
[20:19:47] <cgcardona> luxigo:  strange?
[20:20:39] <sor3nsen> its really just one of those things for a designer to be able to get their vision across
[20:20:40] <luxigo> cgcardona: oh it's jQuery's way...
[20:20:52] <sor3nsen> because if your doing templating/jquery your in effect programming
[20:20:59] <sor3nsen> which might just be refactored anyway
[20:21:18] <sor3nsen> i dont appreciate the flipside of it either, which is forcing a programmer to design the UI/UX
[20:21:34] <sor3nsen> but of course its an unachievable goal
[20:21:54] <sor3nsen> and thinking of how things should work doesnt make it so
[20:22:06] <sor3nsen> but it doesnt change the fact that its the optimal path
[20:22:45] <sor3nsen> to me its just the nature of capitolism
[20:22:53] <sor3nsen> do what your best at
[20:23:41] <sor3nsen> i think we come from different perspectives is all
[20:23:49] <sor3nsen> which is why i enjoy the conversation
[20:24:39] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: you lost me a while ago
[20:24:41] <tbranyen> sorry :-/
[20:24:48] <sor3nsen> no worries
[20:24:53] <sor3nsen> trying to read your goals on the gist
[20:25:03] <sor3nsen> the abstract nature of what your asking has lost me as well
[20:25:11] <sor3nsen> but i do like the custom identifiers
[20:25:58] <tbranyen> those are crucial yea
[20:26:06] <sor3nsen> i just dont see anything in there that i cant already do, aside from what i just said
[20:26:47] <sor3nsen> i'm doing django templating now, after learning jade/markdown/mustache/haml/less/sass
[20:26:58] <bobbobbins> anyone have a chance to look at my problem?
[20:27:03] <sor3nsen> as well as the random posterous templating, CI/F3/Kohana template systems
[20:27:38] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: if you discover how to iterate and obtain useful information from nested object structures in mustache that'd be cool to share
[20:35:16] <karisma_> hey
[21:04:42] <bobbobbins> how can i loop through some divs, find out if each div has a certain class on it, and if so, apply a method to it?
[21:04:48] <jlazaroff> question: is there any way to use load() without fully replacing the contents of the wrapper?
[21:06:07] <ryanneufeld> ?load @jlazaroff
[21:06:07] <bot-t> jlazaroff, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[21:06:26] <ryanneufeld> ?$.load() #jlazaroff
[21:06:27] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/#jlazaroff
[21:07:30] <jlazaroff> ryanneufeld: that second one is what i'm looking for, but all the html inside the element you call load on gets replaced
[21:07:48] <ryanneufeld> right
[21:07:55] <ryanneufeld> so then the answer to your question isâ€¦. ?
[21:08:17] <ryanneufeld> ?$.ajax() @ jlazaroff
[21:08:18] <bot-t> jlazaroff, Ajax - The jQuery library has a full suite of AJAX capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[21:08:31] <ryanneufeld> ?$.get() @jlazaroff
[21:08:32] <bot-t> jlazaroff, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[21:10:53] <jlazaroff> ryanneufeld: so i should just use get() and then filter down to the elements i want?
[21:12:05] <ryanneufeld> yes
[21:12:26] <jlazaroff> ryanneufeld: okay, thanks!
[21:12:30] <ryanneufeld> np
[21:15:09] <MACscr> ok, ok, here is my sample code http://jsfiddle.net/xB8zW/3/ and as you can see, im using $.get to send data to php file. I know how to get the results, but how do i access the variables before they are sent? I want to handle things different based on the variables being sent
[21:16:53] <bobbobbins> can someone check this out: both .spdi calls are happening, but the second one overwrites the first: http://jsfiddle.net/KPG6T/1/
[21:17:43] <bobbobbins> if i comment either out, it works right, but with both...both go into .student_achievement1 and overwrite each other
[21:20:12] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[21:20:29] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: I'm looking at your code now
[21:20:58] <bobbobbins> ryanneufeld, thanks, lemmie know if you have any questions
[21:21:05] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: are you intending to use moot tools?
[21:21:14] <ryanneufeld> also, how is going to load your other JS files?
[21:21:15] <bobbobbins> nah, that was an accident
[21:21:44] <bobbobbins> well it was meant just to show the code, not to actually run
[21:22:03] <bobbobbins> i guess i can change it so it does run
[21:22:16] <ryanneufeld> just did
[21:22:24] <ryanneufeld> at least partially
[21:22:24] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/KPG6T/2/
[21:22:32] <ryanneufeld> you still need the rest of the js loaded
[21:24:28] <bobbobbins> they're not really necessary
[21:24:38] <ryanneufeld> ah
[21:25:00] <bobbobbins> db_controller.php won't run though, i dunno how to fix that, i just started using jsfiddle about 2 hours ago
[21:25:35] <ryanneufeld> not sure man
[21:25:37] <bobbobbins> but anyways, the problem is that even though they're both supposed to show up in different divs, the second one is just overwriting the first
[21:26:46] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: what's the value of $this
[21:27:20] <bobbobbins> umm...i dunno
[21:27:26] <bobbobbins> i was thinking it was that div
[21:27:36] <ryanneufeld> $this isn't anything
[21:27:54] <ryanneufeld> try $(this) instead
[21:28:11] <bobbobbins> i tried that and nothing happens
[21:28:31] <bobbobbins> $this gets its value in the main function
[21:28:36] <bobbobbins> it equals $(this)
[21:29:14] <ryanneufeld> no, it doesn't
[21:29:19] <ryanneufeld> it's out of scope
[21:29:41] <ryanneufeld> do you have a public place I can see this working?
[21:29:48] <bobbobbins> huh, well it writes to .html though
[21:30:09] <bobbobbins> yeah, can I pm it to you?
[21:30:17] <ryanneufeld> yes
[21:30:47] <bobbobbins> sent
[21:32:14] <ryanneufeld> okay
[21:32:22] <ryanneufeld> Lemme see what I can do
[21:33:13] <bobbobbins> thanks, i really appreciate it...im used to just implementing other peoples jquery, making my own stuff is proving to be harder than i thought
[21:34:47] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: The problem is that 'this'  in the context of your varients, is the JSON object
[21:34:51] <ryanneufeld> not your element
[21:35:17] <bobbobbins> yeah, i kinda figured this was the problem, i just have no idea how to fix it
[21:36:05] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: also, you don't have any ids, and you're using a class as your selector
[21:36:11] <ryanneufeld> that's also lending to your problem
[21:36:20] <bobbobbins> yeah, i figured it would just apply to everything with that class
[21:36:43] <ryanneufeld> yes, which is why it's also overwriiting it
[21:36:52] <bobbobbins> but they each have a different class name
[21:37:05] <bobbobbins> student_achievement and studen_achievement1
[21:37:37] <ryanneufeld> use ID's for that
[21:37:47] <ryanneufeld> I found the problem
[21:37:49] <ryanneufeld> hang on
[21:37:54] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna update the fiddle
[21:38:13] <bobbobbins> ok
[21:41:41] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: http://jsfiddle.net/KPG6T/5/
[21:42:18] <ryanneufeld> I put a comment LOOK HERE
[21:43:31] <ryanneufeld> I would also do $("#student_achievement").spdi('variation1', {'school_id' : 2});
[21:43:31] <ryanneufeld> $("#student_achievement1").spdi('variation2', {'school_id' : 1});
[21:43:39] <ryanneufeld> and set the appropriate IDs
[21:43:50] <bobbobbins> ok, lemmie try that
[21:44:53] <bobbobbins> huh, same problem
[21:44:58] <bobbobbins> even with the ids set
[21:45:06] <ryanneufeld> updated where I can see it still?
[21:45:31] <bobbobbins> yup
[21:46:44] <djQuery> bobbobbins: by the way if you do .ajax instead of getJSON you can pass the context object.
[21:47:08] <bobbobbins> ok, i'll switch it to that
[21:47:13] <djQuery> ?ajax context
[21:47:14] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:47:39] <djQuery> This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks. For example specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for theÂ completeÂ callback of a request, like so:
[21:48:39] <bobbobbins> so i set context to this?
[21:49:57] <systemfault> 2 guesses... 1) .ajax has a config option called "context"
[21:50:11] <systemfault> 2) You could use jQuery.proxy to bind one.
[21:50:49] <bobbobbins> well i know it has an option called context, i was wondering what i need to set it to
[21:51:26] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: yes
[21:51:32] <ryanneufeld> I'm still working on it
[21:51:34] <ryanneufeld> not ignoring you
[21:51:44] <ryanneufeld> I think I may be on to something, so bear with me for a few
[21:53:09] <bobbobbins> no worries
[21:53:22] <sor3nsen> woo woo
[21:53:26] <sor3nsen> met the neighbors
[21:55:13] <sor3nsen> tbranyen: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
[21:55:24] <sor3nsen> it appears you can iterate over enumerables
[21:55:29] <sor3nsen> which i've actually never used
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen> {{#a_object}}
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen>   <h1>{{title}}</h1>
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen>   <p>{{description}}</p>
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen>   <ul>
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen>     {{#a_list}}
[21:56:00] <sor3nsen>       <li>{{label}}</li>
[21:56:01] <sor3nsen>     {{/a_list}}
[21:56:01] <sor3nsen>   </ul>
[21:56:02] <sor3nsen> {{/a_object}}
[21:57:40] <tbranyen> sor3nsen: correct, but you can't get the key out of it, you can't do something like {%for key in object%} {{key}} - {{object.key}} {%endfor%}
[21:58:24] <tbranyen> although it could be argued that you should always know the key
[21:58:43] <sor3nsen> yes, i think it is arguable, but i would say its suprizing you cant
[21:59:01] <sor3nsen> most templates can
[21:59:18] <sor3nsen> the author must feel that the key woudl only be used for logic?
[21:59:21] <sor3nsen> not sure
[21:59:22] <MACscr> what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/xB8zW/4/. Its trying to open the link when i have the following set: event.preventDefault();Â // don't follow the link!
[22:00:01] <sor3nsen> MAC: you need to pass event into the function
[22:00:15] <sor3nsen> click(function(event){event.preventDefault();})
[22:00:28] <ryanneufeld> okay bobbobbins I think I have a better idea what's going on
[22:00:40] <bobbobbins> great
[22:00:42] <sor3nsen> $('.ajax-link').click(function(event) {
[22:00:48] <sor3nsen> instead of:
[22:00:48] <sor3nsen> $('.ajax-link').click(function() {
[22:00:50] <ryanneufeld> what's happening is that the second call is getting the same context
[22:00:56] <ryanneufeld> Why that's happening
[22:00:59] <ryanneufeld> is beyond me
[22:01:23] <bobbobbins> any idea how to fix it?
[22:01:25] <ryanneufeld> OMG
[22:01:31] <ryanneufeld> I think I just cracked it!
[22:01:34] <ryanneufeld> gimme a sec
[22:01:37] <bobbobbins> yeah!
[22:01:52] <davidkmo> hey guys... are ajax call cached on firefox/chrome?
[22:02:06] <davidkmo> i tested jquery.ajax({cache: true})
[22:02:16] <davidkmo> doesnt' seem to send cache headers on request
[22:02:56] <sor3nsen> ehh idk
[22:04:27] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: depens on the headers sent by the server
[22:04:44] <davidkmo> is end back tag
[22:04:49] <davidkmo> etag and cachecontrol public
[22:04:53] <davidkmo> it should be cached
[22:04:58] <davidkmo> cache-control:public, max-age=60
[22:05:03] <davidkmo> etag:"df394c592c56856407bc3e92c844afb8d86cb54b052f8cc288031d8f87c67418"
[22:05:16] <davidkmo> Expires:Thu, 09 Jun 2011 05:03:25 GMT
[22:05:23] <davidkmo> expire is fine, i want it to expire
[22:05:28] <davidkmo> but when it hit server, i check etag
[22:05:48] <davidkmo> but, it's not sending etag back to server via request
[22:05:49] <davidkmo> :(
[22:06:23] <ryanneufeld> etags are usually disabled
[22:06:27] <ryanneufeld> any how
[22:06:31] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: http://jsfiddle.net/KPG6T/6/
[22:06:36] <ryanneufeld> so
[22:06:45] <ryanneufeld> the problem was that you didn't use var when delcaring $this
[22:06:48] <davidkmo> what do u mean disabled
[22:06:49] <davidkmo> :(
[22:06:53] <ryanneufeld> so it was a global variable
[22:07:05] <ryanneufeld> and therefor you were only getting the most recent value of it
[22:07:19] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: etags aren't usually on cause it's faster without them
[22:07:24] <davidkmo> ifModifiedBoolean
[22:07:24] <davidkmo> Default: false
[22:07:24] <davidkmo> Allow the request to be successful only if the response has changed since the last request. This is done by checking the Last-Modified header. Default value is false, ignoring the header. In jQuery 1.4 this technique also checks the 'etag' specified by the server to catch unmodified data
[22:07:31] <davidkmo> i need etag
[22:07:41] <davidkmo> i am using etag to verfiery if content is changed
[22:07:42] <ryanneufeld> etag is set on the server side
[22:07:45] <stephen_> hey guys, I'm getting this weird error in ie7 with version 1.6.1. ie's error window says it dies on line 6527, but I breakpointed that line in firebug on firefox and it never hit that line, so I don't even know what the real problem is. has anyone else had this issue?
[22:07:52] <davidkmo> if it havn't, i dont' send back 304 not changed
[22:07:57] <bobbobbins> ryanneufeld, ahh...let me give what you have here a try
[22:08:08] <davidkmo> yes, i know how etag works. :P
[22:08:08] <ryanneufeld> I tested it in firebug
[22:08:25] <ryanneufeld> what's the problem then, sorry.
[22:08:49] <bobbobbins> whats that console.log thing doing?
[22:09:02] <davidkmo> problem is it's not sending cache control
[22:09:03] <davidkmo> in request
[22:09:06] <ryanneufeld> ?console.log @bobbobbins
[22:09:10] <bot-t> bobbobbins, #6688 (jQuery 1.4.2 blocks console.log) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 12 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6688
[22:09:23] <ryanneufeld> okay not what I wanted
[22:09:29] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: check out firebug
[22:09:35] <ryanneufeld> learn it, love it
[22:09:38] <bobbobbins> ahh, i never knew about that
[22:09:50] <bobbobbins> i mean i knew about firebug, but not about console.log
[22:09:55] <coldhead> ?alert
[22:09:56] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[22:09:59] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: so the problem is that the expires isn't set in the request header?
[22:10:06] <ryanneufeld> thx coldhead
[22:10:50] <bobbobbins> it worked! thanks!
[22:11:13] <ryanneufeld> Np
[22:11:35] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: still there?
[22:11:51] <davidkmo> no, request header need to set tag
[22:11:53] <davidkmo> etag
[22:12:15] <davidkmo> etag was part was previous response header
[22:12:21] <davidkmo> that etag shoudl be submitted back
[22:12:30] <davidkmo> so that server can use it to figure out if content changed or not
[22:12:46] <ryanneufeld> why is the server deciding if content changed?
[22:12:52] <davidkmo> so that it can return
[22:12:53] <systemfault> Offtopic: The guitar on www.google.com is fun
[22:12:58] <davidkmo> 304, content not changed
[22:13:00] <davidkmo> instead of 200
[22:13:06] <davidkmo> say u are sendin back 1MB
[22:13:08] <davidkmo> of json data
[22:13:15] <davidkmo> u don't want to send back 1MB
[22:13:16] <davidkmo> every time
[22:13:21] <ryanneufeld> you can do that all on the server side by setting proper expires headers
[22:13:24] <stephen_> @systemfault lol
[22:13:29] <davidkmo> it's differnt
[22:13:31] <davidkmo> etag is for validation
[22:13:53] <davidkmo> client does not know if content on server changed or not
[22:14:09] <davidkmo> cleint need to call server blindly back with the etag that server give back to cleint last time
[22:14:48] <davidkmo> anyway... might not be jquery issue, maybe firefox and chrome doesn't respect cache control when it comes to ajax
[22:15:01] <ryanneufeld> they do, as long as the headers are correct
[22:15:13] <etcetera> how well does jquery work with scss?
[22:15:15] <davidkmo> the header is
[22:15:19] <davidkmo> etag:"1cf6e1d6c8df5b1547ac7ac842dde346b2b535c3102256e83328775f3e617855"
[22:15:24] <davidkmo> that works
[22:15:27] <davidkmo> if i go to the page
[22:15:28] <davidkmo> and refresh it
[22:15:31] <ryanneufeld> That's the content of the header?
[22:15:35] <davidkmo> just doesn't work though
[22:15:37] <davidkmo> ajax
[22:15:40] <davidkmo> here's compelte header

[22:16:18] <ryanneufeld> Expires:Thu, 09 Jun 2011 05:11:57 GMT
[22:16:23] <etcetera> hmm, I suppose not since it's just rendered to css in the end.
[22:16:24] <ryanneufeld> it expires in 60 seconds
[22:16:28] <davidkmo> it's suppose to expire
[22:16:36] <davidkmo> it's suppose to expire right away even
[22:16:49] <davidkmo> there's ttl, and then tehre's etag/last modified time
[22:16:56] <ryanneufeld> so you want near-real time?
[22:17:04] <davidkmo> i dont' care for expire time
[22:17:08] <davidkmo> i want client to hit server
[22:17:18] <davidkmo> server will then 200 or 304 (content not modified)
[22:17:31] <davidkmo> it's hitting server just fine
[22:17:39] <davidkmo> except with out etag
[22:17:53] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[22:17:54] <davidkmo> without etag, server will always send back 200
[22:18:00] <ryanneufeld> I think ifModified is the best bet
[22:18:42] <davidkmo> but it might be firefox/chromet hing
[22:18:45] <ryanneufeld> did you set cache to false?
[22:18:54] <davidkmo> cache is set to tre
[22:18:55] <davidkmo> true
[22:19:03] <ryanneufeld> By default, requests are always issued, but the browser may serve results out of its cache. To disallow use of the cached results, set cache to false. To cause the request to report failure if the asset has not been modified since the last request, set ifModified to true.
[22:19:04] <davidkmo> ppl get mad cuz ie caches ajax calls
[22:19:14] <davidkmo> i get mad cuz firefox/chrome doesnt' cache ajax call
[22:19:15] <davidkmo> LOL
[22:19:30] <ryanneufeld> it does, but for what you want, you have to set cache to false
[22:19:38] <davidkmo> really?
[22:19:41] <davidkmo> OH
[22:19:42] <davidkmo> let me test
[22:20:45] <davidkmo> nope
[22:20:48] <davidkmo> i tried cache: false
[22:20:53] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[22:21:01] <ryanneufeld> what is it that your building?
[22:21:36] <davidkmo> i am testing jqGrid
[22:21:45] <davidkmo> on server side
[22:21:52] <davidkmo> it has pagination
[22:21:58] <davidkmo> i want those pages to be cached
[22:22:08] <davidkmo> just taking caching to extreme
[22:22:56] <ryanneufeld> sounds like you have some conflicting ideas
[22:22:56] <davidkmo> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js
[22:22:59] <davidkmo> wosh!
[22:23:06] <davidkmo> line: 505
[22:23:13] <davidkmo> if ( ( etag = jqXHR.getResponseHeader( "Etag" ) ) ) {
[22:23:14] <davidkmo> jQuery.etag[ ifModifiedKey ] = etag;
[22:23:14] <davidkmo> }
[22:23:31] <davidkmo> it's not just for this purpose
[22:23:39] <davidkmo> i need other stuffs i am working on to be cached also
[22:23:53] <davidkmo> other ajax calls i make with jquery
[22:24:12] <davidkmo> typical html reuqest is two hits
[22:24:14] <ryanneufeld> one thing I would point out is that you can set the cache on the server side to must revalidate
[22:24:17] <davidkmo> first get response, then get body
[22:24:27] <davidkmo> hm..
[22:24:30] <davidkmo> let me check
[22:24:35] <davidkmo> wait
[22:24:40] <davidkmo> revalidating is not the issue
[22:24:42] <ryanneufeld> is your end point php?
[22:25:05] <coldhead> that's what she said
[22:25:09] <bobbobbins> ryanneufeld, any chance I can get you to help me with one more thing?
[22:25:22] <ryanneufeld> oh, I dunnoâ€¦. I suppose :)
[22:25:41] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: shoot
[22:25:43] <bobbobbins> haha, thanks
[22:25:47] <davidkmo> k
[22:25:50] <davidkmo> let me try settting it to
[22:25:53] <davidkmo> must revalidate
[22:26:06] <davidkmo> but yea, i need caching to work, it's important
[22:26:21] <davidkmo> use might click on a light box on page A
[22:26:27] <davidkmo> then go to page B, open same ligth box
[22:26:36] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: have you seen amplify.js ?
[22:26:37] <davidkmo> which hits same ajax server url
[22:26:40] <davidkmo> need it to get cached
[22:26:52] <ryanneufeld> ?amplify.js
[22:26:58] <davidkmo> nope
[22:26:58] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Monday, 2011-05-23 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery-dev_20110523.log.html
[22:27:15] <ryanneufeld> ?google amplify.js # davidkmo
[22:27:16] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Amplify - A Component Library for jQuery - http://amplifyjs.com/#davidkmo
[22:27:19] <davidkmo> http://amplifyjs.com/
[22:27:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[22:27:35] <bobbobbins> if they don't specify which method to run, so if they call $('#mydoc').spdi(); i want it to just loop through the doc and apply each method to any that have that class...does that make sense?
[22:27:47] <davidkmo> interesting
[22:27:51] <davidkmo> i am checking it out
[22:27:55] <sor3nsen> nice site
[22:28:06] <ryanneufeld> it does local storage with fallback to cookie
[22:28:13] <ryanneufeld> so it works on old ie
[22:28:23] <ryanneufeld> we use it on our site and it's pretty good
[22:28:25] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: yes
[22:28:31] <ryanneufeld> I think I understand
[22:28:53] <bobbobbins> basically if you put a class on a div that has the same name as a method, it'll apply that method to the div
[22:29:02] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[22:29:03] <ryanneufeld> okay
[22:29:17] <davidkmo> what's u r site?
[22:29:47] <ryanneufeld> metrolyrics.com
[22:30:16] <davidkmo> wow
[22:30:22] <davidkmo> looks awesome
[22:30:27] <davidkmo> i always wanted to work on a lyric site
[22:30:33] <davidkmo> how's the legal issues?
[22:31:19] <ryanneufeld> NMP
[22:31:22] <ryanneufeld> that's how they are Lo
[22:31:23] <ryanneufeld> lol
[22:31:30] <davidkmo> you should implement fast
[22:31:31] <davidkmo> i mean
[22:31:34] <davidkmo> solr
[22:31:42] <ryanneufeld> what's that?
[22:31:45] <davidkmo> and do full text, and fuzzy text search engine
[22:32:03] <davidkmo> http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
[22:32:19] <ryanneufeld> oh, we already use sphinx
[22:32:30] <davidkmo> o
[22:32:41] <davidkmo> here's my site:
[22:32:42] <davidkmo> http://apps.facebook.com/marketplace/
[22:32:42] <bobbobbins> i use solr, its pretty badass
[22:32:46] <davidkmo> http://www.oodle.com
[22:32:47] <davidkmo> :P
[22:32:49] <davidkmo> we use solr
[22:33:10] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: it is possible to do what you want, I just can't think of a quick way to do it right now
[22:33:21] <ryanneufeld> you'd probably want to write this more as a plug-in
[22:33:34] <bobbobbins> yeah, thats the idea
[22:34:08] <ryanneufeld> what you need is $.each()
[22:34:23] <ryanneufeld> davidkmo: thx I'll check out solr tomorrow
[22:34:39] <ryanneufeld> I'm sorry bobbobbins but I'm about to passout here
[22:34:49] <bobbobbins> no problem, thanks for all your help
[22:34:51] <ryanneufeld> np
[22:36:57] <djQuery> bobbobbins: whats going on?
[22:37:38] <bobbobbins> djQuery: im trying to loop through a bunch of divs, and if they have a class on them that is the same name as one of the methods in my plugIn, i want to apply that method to the div
[22:38:23] <djQuery> $('div.methodname').plugin('method');
[22:38:28] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: http://jsfiddle.net/FaScb/ thats a basic plugin
[22:38:39] <ryanneufeld> that plus some googling should get you going
[22:38:45] <ryanneufeld> you're on the right track already :)
[22:38:48] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[22:38:50] <ryanneufeld> night
[22:38:50] <bobbobbins> wow, thanks!
[22:38:53] <bobbobbins> night
[22:39:40] <ryanneufeld> That's an example of a plugin on our new site (not yet launched) it's a utility function. I'm sure djQuery will understand it enough to explain it.
[22:39:40] <djQuery> and the ui.widget factory is realy cool if you allready have jquery.ui loaded
[22:40:09] <davidkmo> ryanneu
[22:40:12] <davidkmo> i think i found the problem
[22:40:16] <davidkmo> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js
[22:40:22] <davidkmo> line: 670
[22:40:25] <davidkmo> that's where etag is set
[22:41:26] <davidkmo> ifModified must be true
[22:42:50] <djQuery> ?ui.widget
[22:42:51] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[22:43:35] <MACscr> ok, if im using $.get($(this).attr('href'), function(data) to process a url, I know it assigns the returned output to data, but how can i access the actual variables that were in the href? Seems when i try to do: var urldata = $(this).attr('href');, it says the var is undefiend when i print it to console.log
[22:44:37] <djQuery> well u can make it easy on your self by just using this.href for one
[22:44:52] <djQuery> then you could split it on ? then again on $
[22:45:01] <djQuery> sorry on &
[22:46:12] <MACscr> so try console.log(this.href); ?
[22:46:18] <djQuery> sure
[22:46:23] <MACscr> still says undefined
[22:46:36] <djQuery> what about console.log(this);
[22:46:56] <MACscr> though its definitely showing the get request with firebug when link is clicked
[22:47:41] <MACscr> oks, so console.log(this) definitely gave me data
[22:49:44] <amid_hasan> is there a way i can convert a windows media video to html5 video?
[22:50:50] <iszak> amid_hasan, there's really no defacto html5 video codec though, you'll need to atleast dual encode it in VP8 and H.264
[22:50:58] <iszak> sorry WebM and VP8
[22:51:15] <iszak> Alternatively you could use VP8 + Flash fall back which I do believe supports VP8
[22:51:20] <iszak> s/VP8/WebM
[22:51:40] <amid_hasan> of Windows Media -> Flash
[22:51:53] <iszak> pardon?
[22:51:57] <djQuery> webm would be appreciated
[22:52:07] <amid_hasan> whats webm?
[22:52:17] <iszak> it's the container format for VP8 and OGG
[22:52:47] <iszak> see you have the container and the codecs for audio/video WebM is the container, VP8 is the video codec, OGG is the audio codec
[22:52:53] <amid_hasan> www.webmproject.org?
[22:52:57] <iszak> yes
[22:53:37] <amid_hasan> Can I initiate encoding via javascript?
[22:53:41] <amid_hasan> client side
[22:55:05] <iszak> amid_hasan, encoding the video? lolno
[22:56:34] <MACscr> djQuery: ok, so once i have $this as an object. how do i just get the href as a string? Sorry, my jquery skillset has severely diminished with not using it for so long
[22:56:41] <amid_hasan> Here is my dilemma. I have a video scream that is encoded for Windows Media player playback. I am trying to play it on a device that supports Flash, or HTML5 video. I need to do something in between, and I dont know how to.
[22:56:48] <amid_hasan> *sorry
[22:56:50] <amid_hasan> *stream
[22:56:55] <amid_hasan> not scream
[22:57:09] <djQuery> if you have $this as an abject then you need to do $this.attr('href')
[22:59:07] <iszak> amid_hasan, flash should support VP8
[22:59:17] <bobbobbins> if you look in the init section here you can kind of see what i want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/dM2pB/
[22:59:47] <bobbobbins> my vars aren't passing properly though...it says data undefined in variation1
[23:00:04] <MACscr> djQuery: you sure? firebug says: $this is not defined				var urldata = $this.attr('href');
[23:00:27] <coreyman> http://www.yourdomaingoeshere.com/testing2/reseller.html if you grab the slider and drag it, the change event doesnt fire until you let go of the mouse, why is this? is there a way I can make it fire every time the slider goes 'sticky'?
[23:00:28] <djQuery> ?p@macscr
[23:00:29] <bot-t> macscr, .text() - Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[23:00:40] <djQuery> ?p @macscr
[23:00:40] <bot-t> macscr, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[23:00:55] <Caraes_Naur> slider has a slide event
[23:01:22] <djQuery> ?p
[23:01:22] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[23:01:38] <djQuery> there fixed p to no longer be the damn .text
[23:01:57] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur , so the slide event performs the same as change by returning the value?
[23:02:05] <MACscr> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/xB8zW/13/
[23:02:46] <Caraes_Naur> are you using the jquery ui slider?
[23:03:16] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur disregard that question that was a dumb question I wasn't thinking right.
[23:03:32] <djQuery> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/xB8zW/15/
[23:03:35] <Caraes_Naur> k
[23:04:48] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur when I use the slide event it seems to be one value behind.
[23:04:48] <MACscr> djQuery: ah, that makes sense. Thanks!
[23:05:04] <thinkster> Is there a plugin for font face?
[23:05:27] <thinkster> I remember one, but I can't find it anymore
[23:05:31] <Caraes_Naur> are you sure your value range is correct?
[23:05:56] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur yes .. if you are looking at the page I'll change it to change event
[23:06:34] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur ok it is currently using the change event.
[23:08:18] <djQuery> MACscr: by the way .get just calls .ajax   if you wanted to you could drop down to to using .ajax instead of .get and have access to the context parameter of .ajax
[23:11:54] <bobbobbins> this is as close as I can get, but when init is called it returns an error that data is undefined in variation1: http://jsfiddle.net/dM2pB/1/
[23:12:50] <bobbobbins> actually it says the second argument to apply must be an array
[23:13:50] <coreyman> Caraes_Naur i was thinking I may need to use the stop event as well, but I'm looking at http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#steps and they only use slide.
[23:14:52] <bobbobbins> if anyones still awake please take a look so i can finish this up and go to bed
[23:16:56] <sor3nsen> im awake
[23:23:15] <bobbobbins> sor3nsen, so any idea whats wrong with my script?
[23:25:44] <goshawk> hi
[23:28:02] <goshawk> i'm new in jquery, how do i get the "action" of a form in this html snippet ? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403244/
[23:28:38] <systemfault> goshawk: The content?
[23:28:56] <goshawk> systemfault, ?
[23:28:59] <goshawk> what do u mean ?
[23:29:01] <systemfault> goshawk: $('form').attr('action') I guess
[23:29:13] <systemfault> goshawk: The question is not super clear.. :/
[23:30:11] <goshawk> systemfault, ok i want that when i click the .submit button i get the url to which i should submit
[23:30:15] <goshawk> i've to do an ajax call
[23:30:34] <systemfault> action should be an url..
[23:30:45] <systemfault> I don't really understand what you're doing.
[23:31:19] <goshawk> systemfault, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403246/
[23:31:56] <systemfault> goshawk: bind to the submit event
[23:32:20] <goshawk> systemfault, what do u mean ?
[23:32:36] <systemfault> $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); doAjaxCallHere(...);   });
[23:33:07] <goshawk> systemfault, what does the e.preventDefault() does ?
[23:33:07] <coreyman> I don't understand why the 'slide' event isn't working well on this jquery slider, but the 'change' even works just fine, can anyone help me out? http://www.yourdomaingoeshere.com/testing2/reseller.html
[23:33:32] <systemfault> goshawk: Exactly as it says, prevent the default which is to submit the fort.
[23:33:34] <systemfault> *form
[23:35:31] <goshawk> systemfault, i now have
[23:35:32] <goshawk> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403247/
[23:35:38] <melvinram> anyone know of a jquery carousel that allows you to have multiple carousels on one page?
[23:36:15] <coreyman> melvinram all of them?
[23:36:20] <goshawk> systemfault, i still get redirected like a normal post
[23:36:35] <coreyman> melvinram just change the ids on the carousel
[23:36:51] <marcus_b> gidday
[23:36:52] <systemfault> goshawk: http://jsfiddle.net/XBdFq/
[23:37:04] <systemfault> goshawk: Hope it helps
[23:37:04] <melvinram> coreyman: yes, but that would require calling on each one individually, no?
[23:37:06] <marcus_b> i have a burning question
[23:37:14] <heshanh> does safari not support the browser function?
[23:37:25] <goshawk> systemfault, thanks!
[23:37:26] <heshanh> it gives me an object wth nothing sinide
[23:37:28] <heshanh> inside*
[23:38:03] <coreyman> melvinram i suppose so, does that induce a problem?
[23:38:03] <melvinram> coreyman: and just to be clear, I got them working... but the next and previous buttons on any of them trigger the next or previous actions on all the carousels
[23:38:12] <marcus_b> i hope anyone can help me
[23:38:23] <coreyman> melvinram ahhh i see.
[23:38:46] <melvinram> coreyman: yes, I have 30+ carousels and they are all generated dynamically
[23:39:01] <melvinram> so I can't call it individually
[23:39:38] <marcus_b> anyone?
[23:40:07] <melvinram> marcus_b: what is your question/problem?
[23:40:17] <marcus_b> I'd like to know if there's a way to do this with jquery: http://www.therealthings.com/imagecrop_overlay.jpg
[23:40:30] <melvinram> marcus_b: yes there is
[23:40:44] <marcus_b> i know i can do this easily in flash with the use of masks and overlaying divs
[23:40:50] <coreyman> melvinram I haven't used very many of them so I'm not an expert in that area and can not reccomend you a single solution. A quick google search brought up a bunch of different carousel though
[23:41:08] <melvinram> coreyman: yea, i've looked at a lot of them
[23:41:31] <coreyman> melvinram maybe someone else here can assist you better, I am still waiting on an answer to my question as well.
[23:41:35] <melvinram> marcus_b: that image doesn't do a good job of explaining specifically what you're trying to achieve
[23:41:50] <marcus_b> melvinram, i know i can do this with 1 image and overlay a png, but in this case both images are dynamic
[23:42:09] <melvinram> marcus_b: just put them into 2 divs
[23:42:26] <StevenTyler> well
[23:42:38] <marcus_b> melvinram: i know, but both are cut off at 45Â° and overlay eachother
[23:42:47] <melvinram> marcus_b: so?
[23:42:50] <melvinram> marcus_b: z-index
[23:43:32] <marcus_b> melvinram: yes, but how can i cut off an image and have partial transparency
[23:43:40] <ThomK> Hi. I have problem. Dunno if it's jQuery, Django or JSON2, but... I have ajax app, response data is JSON (Django, with escapejs filter), then I'm using JSON2 data = json.parse, and $('#foo').html(data.content), after I alter html in #foo... every element after that #foo is gone in IE 7/8. :O In IE 9 and any other browser everything is fine.
[23:44:01] <melvinram> marcus_b: you want to do the actual image processing using javascript?
[23:44:14] <marcus_b> melvinram: both images have overlap as you can see
[23:44:27] <marcus_b> melvinram: like this //
[23:44:40] <melvinram> marcus_b: will they or won't they already have the transparency part in the images?
[23:44:47] <marcus_b> melvinram: no
[23:45:08] <melvinram> so you want to do the image processing using javascript
[23:45:12] <marcus_b> melvinram: the client will upload his image using a cms
[23:45:37] <melvinram> marcus_b: yes, but the cms could do the processing and provide you an image that has the transparency in it
[23:45:49] <marcus_b> melvinram: no
[23:45:57] <melvinram> no?
[23:46:09] <melvinram> speak in complete sentences please
[23:46:34] <coreyman> marcus_b its better left to PHP I do beleive, and if it needs to be in 'real time' you can just send data back and fourth with ajax.
[23:46:36] <marcus_b> melvinram: i don't have a cms that can create partial transparency for an image
[23:47:15] <marcus_b> melvinram: the image needs to be masked, and i mean really masked like flash can do
[23:47:56] <melvinram> marcus_b: okay well you might want to look into http://www.pixastic.com
[23:48:10] <melvinram> marcus_b: I dont know enough about it to give you good advice
[23:48:26] <marcus_b> melvinram: ok, thanks
[23:48:50] <coreyman> melvinram doesnt seem to work in chrome :P
[23:48:58] <coreyman> I don't understand why the 'slide' event isn't working well on this jquery slider, but the 'change' even works just fine, can anyone help me out? http://www.yourdomaingoeshere.com/testing2/reseller.html
