[00:00:14] <Nebros> i have created a webpage. http://img4.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/seite5cnr2u7jk3.png, the problem now: 2 of this tables need 15sec for loading, the hole page is loading first and displays all together. what i have tried till now...: i became this as a fast show, how to do http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/5bne4/ i made after this, the pages one.html, two.html... 2 samples of my pages are here in http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/ppjsn/
[00:00:23] <Nebros> this is my ajax: http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/g30ac/
[00:00:49] <Nebros> and this a django part for the html pages. (it makes requests and load the data out of the db. its a simple version of it) http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/yr2yv/
[00:01:01] <Nebros> now: how i have to implement this Loading symbol? (last part of script)
[00:01:08] <Nebros> and why i have only "loading..." in my table, but its not loading?
[00:01:15] <grafi> fRAiLtY- http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/6/ this should count down to 11 each day, or if 11 is already passed to 11 next day as for how to get rid of the days if have no idea ;)
[00:01:51] <Nebros> now you all can see, why i sayed i have a big question... ^^
[00:04:21] <fRAiLtY-> grafi:  I just need to "not display them" in html terms
[00:04:33] <fRAiLtY-> I'm not really bothered if they're "calculated or whatever"
[00:05:20] <grafi> just set .countDays and .countDiv0 display: none then?
[00:06:49] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/7/ like this fRAiLtY-
[00:09:33] <Nebros> is anyone waching my problem or was it to much? :P
[00:09:50] <grafi> too much ;)
[00:10:19] <Nebros> ;(
[00:10:20] <fRAiLtY-> grafi:  Legend, thanks!
[00:10:46] <flat_eri_> guys, i need help! every time, when i try to implement the view more button in fullcalendar, i get the errormessage "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appointments' of null" and the events are shown in the headline of the weekdays e. g. beside monday. i've followed the description like on github but no chance... any ideas please?
[00:13:03] <Nebros> it looks like much, but it isnt. its a normal, simple hp, and a try to load the tables step by step... ^^
[00:14:10] <grafi> things that take 15 seconds to load seem weird to me
[00:15:10] <Nebros> the 15 sec is cause i make with odbc connections to 3 db's and this takes the time...
[00:19:17] <grafi> so Nebros does the load actually do something and just not show the data?
[00:20:47] <fRAiLtY-> grafi:  Any suggestions as to why I get "jQuery is undefined" when I load it into my site, I think it's because of the (jQuery) after the first function, but I'm using prototype as well so I think $ will conflict
[00:21:21] <grafi> have a link so i can look directly at the site fRAiLtY- ?
[00:21:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: no (jQuery) is just from a wrapper
[00:21:46] <fRAiLtY-> grafi:  http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing/
[00:21:56] <Cork> most likely its a (function($) {})(jQuery); wrapper
[00:22:13] <Nebros> grafi its just show the "Loading...", but is not loading something
[00:22:46] <grafi> well the first thing would be to get firebug/devtools running and seeing if the request gets send ...
[00:23:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: where are yo doing the jquery call that fails?
[00:24:39] <Nebros> grafi, can i query you?
[00:24:44] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I'm guessing it's the very first line of the script, perhaps I should do jQuery.(function(jQuery) { } )(jQuery); ?
[00:24:48] <grafi> feel free Nebros
[00:25:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: no; and i get no errors loading that page
[00:25:09] <hekep> hi is it ok to do like this : $('#selector').html('blaaa').show().addClass('ccs-yes');
[00:25:23] <Cork> hekep: sure
[00:25:47] <Cork> it will the last two commands will be on the #selector element though, not the things you added
[00:25:49] <grafi> fRAiLtY- you should probably include jquery before you try loading scripts that need jquery :o
[00:26:22] <Cork> ah hmm
[00:26:27] <hekep> Cork yes , that is that I need !
[00:26:28] <Cork> wonder why i didn't get that error before
[00:26:40] <Cork> hekep: and thats what you have
[00:27:24] <Cork> *%"#)¤/"#***
[00:27:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you include the jquery inline in the bottom of the html page?!?
[00:28:02] <Cork> well not exactly the bottom, but almost
[00:28:31] <grafi> looks like a bit of a mess ^^
[00:28:45] <fRAiLtY-> Huh? I don't see it at the bottom/near ?
[00:29:06] <Cork> line 941
[00:29:18] <Cork> to line 1200
[00:29:31] <Cork> ah sorry 1120
[00:29:52] <fRAiLtY-> Yeah sorry that's part of a template file, using Magento
[00:30:00] <Cork> ya, i missread the comments
[00:30:04] <fRAiLtY-> That's specific to individual pages
[00:30:08] <Cork> :/
[00:30:15] <Cork> where do you have the jquery library?
[00:30:23] <fRAiLtY-> In the head, grrr twice it seems
[00:30:46] * Cork nods
[00:30:56] * Cork hits his browser
[00:30:58] <grafi> its all in your head *sings*
[00:31:01] <Cork> stupid search...
[00:31:09] <grafi> how do you hit a browser :o
[00:31:17] <grafi> furiosly clicking?
[00:31:18] <fRAiLtY-> Lemme sort that first
[00:31:21] <Cork> ya :D
[00:35:42] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: btw i think i've said this to you before; your doctype is invalid
[00:35:52] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, ok
[00:36:06] <fRAiLtY-> Ideally I should include jQuery directly after prototype?
[00:36:10] <Cork> you're doctype is for xhtml but your sending html
[00:36:24] <Cork> no just <!doctype html> instead of what you have
[00:36:56] <Cork> also you should prob run a validation on that page
[00:37:19] <Cork> you have LOADS of invalid html in there (and invalid xhtml if you would try to go with that)
[00:54:43] <MissGeek> hi guys, can anyone suggest a good text editor for jQuery?

[01:21:46] <mouses> anybody up?
[01:22:06] <mouses> is there a way around IE's bug for z-index being ignored on flash embeds?
[01:22:15] <mouses> fucking IE10 still has the issue
[01:22:40] <mouses> i have a photo gallery above a youtube embed
[01:23:03] <Cork> mouses: i'm quite sure there is
[01:23:11] <mouses> and the photo image loads on top and part of the bottom clips the flash. IE ignores the z-index
[01:23:18] <Cork> don't have it on the top of my head, but i think you added a wrapper or something
[01:24:16] <mouses> i tried adding wmode="opaque" to the <embed> directly through IE developer tools and it doesnt work
[01:25:08] <Cork> ya wmode isn't dynamic in any browser
[01:25:23] <Cork> its handed over to the embeded plugin when its loaded
[01:26:02] <systemfault> Right, it must be set at initialization
[01:28:25] <kreantos> hi, when i try to run  $("#skd-statusLine").slideUp() it tells me 'slideUp is not a function'  did anyone of you ever faced this problem
[01:30:17] <mouses> ok well i'm using youtube's given iframe code to embed. i translate it to jquery using... $("<iframe></iframe>", videoParams).appendTo(videoWrapper;
[01:31:02] <mouses> var videoParams = {
[01:31:02] <mouses> 		 		src: url
[01:31:03] <mouses> 		 		frameborder: 0,
[01:31:03] <mouses> 		 		wmode: "opaque"
[01:31:03] <mouses> 			}
[01:31:29] <mouses> something like that (before the iframe node creation
[01:31:55] <mouses> but that will put the params on the iframe
[01:31:56] <systemfault> mouses: IIRC, it only works if you pass it in the url
[01:32:17] <systemfault> append ?wmode=opaque to the url
[01:33:37] <mouses> lemme try
[01:37:03] <marcules> Schönen guten Morgen :)
[01:37:25] <systemfault> usen englishen heren, righten?
[01:37:36] <systemfault> welcomen!
[01:38:03] <texinwien> hallo marcules. sprichst englisch?
[01:38:21] <marcules> Of course, just wanted to wish you all a good morning ^^
[01:38:47] <systemfault> Thank you :D

[01:39:08] <mattyh88> hey i'm trying to sort my date column with tablesorter but the dates don't sort in the correct way. This is what I have: https://gist.github.com/4619212
[01:39:11] <systemfault> Unfortunately, I can't read german :(
[01:39:37] <mattyh88> my 2 date columns are the second and third columns in the table
[01:47:14] <systemfault> mouses: I guess it means that it works now? :P
[01:47:45] <mouses> i still havent tried, i am building the logic around it
[01:47:57] <mouses> i have code around it that checks for ? or & in url
[01:48:15] <shadow_fox> Hi, Small issue is there, While applying the backstretch js for my website the images are coming full screen but not the full image, top and bottom part getting cropped off. But while applying the same in jsfiddle its coming great. Can someone look into it and tell me where this is going wrong. site:: http://payhome.in/demo and jsfiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/7QhJg/
[01:48:17] <mouses> i'm modifying that now to future proof my code, then i will add that param to the querystring
[01:48:26] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[01:48:49] <mouses> but thanks, i found somebody who agrees with you on stackoverflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9074365/youtube-video-embedded-via-iframe-ignoring-z-index
[01:49:49] <stemid> I think I'm running into a common issue but can't figure it out. I post to a form using post() and get returned data in html. I console.log the data to make sure it's proper. but when I then use it in a $('#div').empty().html(data); it shows up as just text, no html tags are being used. just a wall of text.
[01:49:57] <iman> I use qtip as tooltip plugin, but it's not complete yet and doesn't support many thins like function, what jquery tooltip do you suggest me ?
[01:50:09] <smt> is there any posibility to have a parent element (small) to overlay its (absolutely positioned) big child element using jquery?
[01:50:10] <hiemanshu> hey guys first time using jquery, trying to use jquery and the scrollTo plugin to scroll to the bottom of the page but it doesn't seem to be working.  http://fpaste.org/BdNn/ is the code
[01:53:08] <hiemanshu> I am able to use the javascript console and the command works, but not on its own for some reason
[01:53:10] <hiemanshu> what am I missing?
[01:54:06] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using nivoslider. Anyone who has used this, is there a way to make things slide OUT then in. at the moment the new slide just overlaps the old and looks quite bad. Be great if the old slide can slide out and make way for the next to slide in...
[01:57:50] <vlad_starkov> Question: does anyone know how to get element's bottom coord relative to the window?
[01:59:07] <Cork> vlad_starkov: $(this).offset().top + $(this).height()
[02:01:59] <flat_eri_> I've the following problem... when I implement the view more button in fullcalendar, I get the error message "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appointments' of null" and the events are shown in the headline of the weekdays. e. g. beside monday. I followed the description like on github but no chance... any ideas please?
[02:03:00] <flat_eric_> someone? =)
[02:05:18] <vlad_starkov> Cork: mmmm nope. This is how much pixels from the bottom of the window to the top side of the element. But I'm looking for how to get the amount of pixels from the bottom side of the window to the bottom side of element, like as it works in CSS.
[02:06:29] <Cork> vlad_starkov: so $(window).height() - ($(this).offset().top + $(this).height())
[02:07:31] <vlad_starkov> Cork: Yay!
[02:07:38] <vlad_starkov> Cork: thnx
[02:07:42] <Cork> np
[02:08:12] <Cork> to be really strict it should be $(this).offsetParent().height()
[02:08:25] <Cork> vlad_starkov: so $(this).offsetParent().height() - ($(this).offset().top + $(this).height())
[02:09:34] <vlad_starkov> Cork: thnx again!
[02:10:23] <jacta> Can anyone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/2/ - I only want to see the ul for nearest checked radio button, is that possible?
[02:12:04] <Cork> jacta: your html structure is broken; could you please correct it?
[02:12:57] <jacta> Can't see why its broken?
[02:13:00] <Crrrl> hi #jquery
[02:13:07] <flat_eric_> have't someone experiences with fullcalendar "view more" button?
[02:13:38] <Cork> jacta: ah sorry its just jsfidle thats an ass
[02:13:44] <Cork> jacta: you want nextAll not next
[02:13:49] <Cork> opps sorry
[02:13:57] <Cork> nextAll('ul').first()
[02:14:19] <jacta> I want all ul's to be display:none, until a radio is checked, then nearest ul display:block
[02:14:24] <jacta> dunno how to explain best :\
[02:14:34] <Cork> jacta: what i gave you is the solution
[02:14:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/5/
[02:15:26] <jacta> but when I check test3 it should close other ul's
[02:15:39] <Cork> ah, you would have to do that explicitly
[02:15:48] <jacta> from tset1/2 if not allready closed, only one ul visible at a time
[02:16:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/6/
[02:16:31] <jacta> smart! :)
[02:16:36] <jacta> didnt think of that :)
[02:16:54] <Cork> jacta: i suggest using a class instead
[02:16:58] <Cork> that makes it a bit cleaner
[02:21:18] <Cork> jacta: http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/7/
[02:21:34] <jacta> Looking :)
[02:22:32] <jacta> aah, also smart way yes - maybe the best, thanks alot
[02:35:16] <ggherdov> hi all. I am enjoing the javascript console in Firebug to inspect my code. Question: how do I know more about a given object X? example: in python I have typeof(X) for the type, dir(X) for the list of methods and attributes, eventually a X.__str__ for a pretty printed representation... I js I have only found "typeof" so far. are there more introspection builtins ?
[02:36:44] <Cork> ggherdov: not sure what you mean
[02:37:11] <Cork> ggherdov: if you grab the name of a function and run it without () you will get the source
[02:37:28] <Cork> if you call an object you can inspect it from the result
[02:37:36] <Cork> what else is it your looking for?
[02:38:04] <xec> ggherdov: you can do console.dir(obj)
[02:38:34] <ggherdov> Cork: all methods available on a given object for instance. I am not sure if what I ask makes sense, though.
[02:38:38] <ggherdov> xec: trying that
[02:38:52] <xec> actually dir(obj) works too, when typing in console directly
[02:38:56] <Cork> ggherdov: Object.keys(obj.prototype)
[02:39:13] <ggherdov> xec: that's it. dir() is what I wanted! thank you
[02:39:18] <Cork> if you mean to see its scope; you can't
[02:39:21] <ggherdov> Cork: interesting too
[02:41:58] <Crrrl> anyone worked with http://joelb.me/scrollpath/ ?
[02:49:03] <yousaf> can someone please help?
[02:49:10] <yousaf> my nivo slider stopped working http://www.chartwellblack.com/
[02:50:45] <fnagel> yousaf:; seems you updated jQuery, right?
[02:51:34] <fnagel> looks like nivo uses live() which is nbo longer supported by jQuery
[02:54:57] <yousaf> can't find any link that confirms live() is not longer supported
[02:55:34] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:55:46] <Cork> "version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9"
[02:56:03] <Cork> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live()."
[02:56:15] <Cork> i don't know how much more precise they have to be
[02:56:58] <Cork> and yes live is a horrible feature that should never have landed in jquery
[02:57:03] <yousaf> ah noticed
[02:57:07] <Cork> (was originally a plugin for jquery)
[02:57:13] <yousaf> so should I change it to delegate()?
[02:57:19] <Cork> yes
[02:57:29] <Cork> delegate or on depending on what you prefer
[03:01:20] <yousaf> thank you
[03:03:29] <seba4> jsfidldle works?
[03:03:43] <seba4> ok loaded now
[03:09:45] <fnagel> I would recomend using on
[03:10:23] <Cork> fnagel: doens't really matter if you use on's second syntax or delegate
[03:10:36] <Cork> its all up to what you prefer as a maintainer
[03:27:08] <fnagel> Im pretty sure that what they said abot using live() some time ago ;-)
[03:28:29] <yousaf> .on worked for me
[03:28:40] <yousaf> thanks guys

[03:41:11] <aaronmcadam> JavaScript Weekly is an awesome newsletter
[03:41:33] <woozly> goood, very good. Thank you man. And what About non-js oriented? (not only js)
[03:41:41] <woozly> like SM, TC?

[03:41:51] <aaronmcadam> TechCrunch is fucking shit
[03:41:55] <woozly> aaronmcadam: thank you man!
[03:42:12] <woozly> Guys, sorry for my offtopic.
[03:42:20] <aaronmcadam> ruby inside
[03:42:35] <aaronmcadam> http://planetrubyonrails.com/
[03:43:07] <amcsi_work> hi
[03:43:22] <aaronmcadam> woozly: I'd remove TC
[03:43:24] <amcsi_work> what's the best way of uniting multiple selected jquery objects?
[03:43:35] <aaronmcadam> woozly: even net magazine is better than TC
[03:43:54] <amcsi_work> If there's anything better than $(els1).add(els2).add(els3)...
[03:43:56] <aaronmcadam> amesi_work: in a selector: $('a, b, c')
[03:44:03] <woozly> aaronmcadam: thanks about net magazine!
[03:44:14] <aaronmcadam> woozly: don't trust their code examples tho
[03:44:19] <amcsi_work> not selectors, jquery objects
[03:44:21] <woozly> okay :)
[03:44:50] <aaronmcadam> what are you trying to do
[03:45:59] <MalMen> anyone can take a look please http://pastebin.com/1zm0AWun
[03:46:01] <MalMen> thank you
[03:46:34] <aaronmcadam> with no explanation?
[03:47:24] <bullicon>  "cookie=value; domain=.example.com; path=/" <- is there something missing?
[03:47:25] <MalMen> the explanation is on paste
[03:47:38] <bullicon> I am trying to set a third-party cookie, am I missing anything from above?
[03:47:59] <aaronmcadam> ?jq
[03:47:59] <drim> I have multiples select with a name generated like this ad_unit[adRules][0][code], ad_unit[adRules][1][code], ad_unit[adRules][3][code] etc
[03:48:04] <MalMen> i want to make a get and the $.getJSON is turning the var page into page%5B%5D :\
[03:48:12] <shoky> MalMen: what's x
[03:48:13] <drim> how can I select all ?
[03:48:35] <drim> $('select[name="ad_unit[adRules][*][code]"]') something like this doesn't work
[03:48:44] <shoky> >js unescape('page%5B%5D')
[03:48:48] <shoky> js> unescape('page%5B%5D')
[03:48:51] <b-ot> No output.
[03:49:07] <MalMen> shoky take a look here http://pastebin.com/1zm0AWun
[03:49:08] <shoky> js> console.log( unescape('page%5B%5D') )
[03:49:11] <b-ot> No output.
[03:49:26] <MalMen> is the jquery that is creating the strange vars
[03:49:30] <shoky> MalMen: i did.
[03:49:38] <shoky> MalMen: my guess is x is an array
[03:49:47] <MalMen> hmmmm
[03:50:02] <MalMen> but the strange chars is before the x
[03:50:07] <MalMen> i will try put a static value
[03:50:15] <shoky> MalMen: thats how you put an array in the query string..
[03:50:27] <shoky> it's not strange chars, it's  []
[03:50:55] <MalMen> hmmm, it worked.. :) seems you are right, x must be an array
[03:53:18] <rce> Is there a sane way to make jQuery UI's datepicker update the input field and its own view when choosing month/year from dropdown?
[03:54:18] <aaronmcadam> rce: callbacks
[03:54:23] <aaronmcadam> I'm sure there's a hook
[03:56:53] <Luke23ae> hi
[03:56:54] <Luke23ae> I'm trying to register my plugin at plugins.jquery.com
[03:57:05] <Luke23ae> I went though the steps on http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[03:57:10] <__tom__> hey guys. I'm having the most strange issue. I'm trying to set/unset checkboxes in a form. It works just fine in the DOM (i.e. Firebug shows the checked attribute on the input element being set/unset), but the visual display in the browser only works in the uncheck direction, i.e. it removes checks, but never sets them. Help? :-)
[03:57:16] <Luke23ae> but it just doesn't show
[03:57:22] <Luke23ae> I tried to register it 13 hours ago
[03:58:05] <__tom__> I've made sure I'm not falling into the most common traps, like wrong IDs, etc. - as I said, Firebug shows it's working, it just doesn't show.
[03:58:19] <blackspotwiggins> __tom__, attribute != property
[03:58:43] <__tom__> blackspotwiggins: uh? can you be a bit more elaborate, please?
[03:59:07] <blackspotwiggins> setting an attribute does not change the internal state
[03:59:19] <blackspotwiggins> you probably want to change the property
[03:59:27] <__tom__> yes
[03:59:38] <blackspotwiggins> in older jquery versions, attr() did both, kinda
[03:59:50] <blackspotwiggins> not anymore tho
[04:00:17] <Anticom> hi all
[04:01:29] <__tom__> ah, ok. So I need to use a different selector? can you point me in the right direction?
[04:01:52] <shoky> __tom__: .prop('checked', true)  or .prop('checked', false)
[04:01:55] <blackspotwiggins> that is not what i said at all
[04:03:28] <__tom__> shoky: thanks, that was it.
[04:03:46] <__tom__> blackspotwiggins: sorry, I misunderstood. shoky's solution works. Thank you for explaining.
[04:10:39] <Anticom> i've tried "input[type=checkbox]:selected" to get all checked checkboxes
[04:10:43] <Anticom> somehow that doesn't work :/
[04:10:45] <Anticom> any ideas?
[04:11:22] <Anticom> oh
[04:11:26] <Anticom> :checked seems right :>
[04:12:59] <rce> aaronmcadam: I got it to work trough onChangeMonthYear just now but if I change from Mar 31st to Feb 31st (which doesn't exist), it changes to Sep 1st.
[04:13:21] <iman> are there any way to increase div's height and wight based of content ?
[04:13:22] <bigbob> Okay, just implemented the jquery and the forms appear when I click, but only if I am on the current page. If I am linked from a separate page, the form is hidden first, so I have to click the link again. Any way to show the jquery form if I am linked from a certain page?
[04:13:27] <rce> Date checking sounds like painful stuff. :|
[04:14:04] <BadCodSmell> Does anyone know what happened to jquery-glob?
[04:14:32] <aaronmcadam> ?eval ('test')
[04:14:43] <aaronmcadam> no more bottyyyy
[04:15:42] <aaronmcadam> I dunno why you'd need jquery-glob
[04:16:03] <Anticom> what do i have to return in $.map() method, so that nothing get's added to the output array for the current element?
[04:16:09] <Anticom> false / null?
[04:16:15] <aaronmcadam> false
[04:16:18] <Anticom> ty :)
[04:16:22] <aaronmcadam> np
[04:16:25] <BadCodSmell> You don't know why I would need it?
[04:16:29] <aaronmcadam> null should potentially work
[04:16:33] <BadCodSmell> I need it for globalisation.
[04:16:37] <aaronmcadam> but false definitely does
[04:16:51] <aaronmcadam> You mean internationalisation?
[04:16:57] <BadCodSmell> Are you saying there's another way of offerring globalisation?
[04:17:12] <aaronmcadam> globalisation means something different to me haha
[04:17:27] <aaronmcadam> you mean localisation/i18n/translation?
[04:17:31] <Anticom> aaronmcadam now i got some false's in my array :O
[04:17:36] <aaronmcadam> hahha
[04:17:45] <BadCodSmell> I want to be able to display dates, numbers and currencies according to a specified locale.
[04:17:49] <aaronmcadam> yep
[04:18:08] <aaronmcadam> the word "globalisation" is what threw me off
[04:18:32] <aaronmcadam> it's called localisation or internationalisation (i18n for short)
[04:18:43] <aaronmcadam> try searching for that as a replacement
[04:19:06] <aaronmcadam> I thought it was a plugin that made globals of everything or something retarded like that
[04:19:26] <aaronmcadam> Anticom: jsfiddle it
[04:19:34] <mhrowa> Hullo. If using jQuery, do I need to download any stuff?
[04:19:35] <aaronmcadam> !bot?
[04:19:37] <Anticom> aaronmcadam still debugging :)
[04:19:44] <mhrowa> Coz I just pasted those http://www.kriesi.at/archives/create-simple-tooltips-with-css-and-jquery into my code but it aint work
[04:19:45] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[04:19:47] <aaronmcadam> where are you :(
[04:19:50] <Anticom> had some trouble with the data i've put into .map() func
[04:20:03] <aaronmcadam> mhrowa: yeah install it on your start menu
[04:20:15] <aaronmcadam> type `run jquery`
[04:20:32] <aaronmcadam> Anticom: just make a jsfiddle with a simple array to test
[04:20:35] <Anticom> argh fuuuuu always messing with the order of key and value in the closure :D
[04:20:46] * Anticom facepalms
[04:20:51] <aaronmcadam> index, value
[04:21:59] <mhrowa> aaronmcadam: but it works on computers without it downloaded, do it not? Only developer needs to download it?
[04:22:16] <aaronmcadam> Anticom: I think the way to do it is to not return anything in a map if you don't want it
[04:22:27] <aaronmcadam> mhrowa: I'm trolling ye dude
[04:22:41] <aaronmcadam> mhrowa:http://jqfundamentals.com/
[04:22:44] <Anticom> aaronmcadam it's fine now
[04:22:47] <mhrowa> Dude I ain't know nothing about it
[04:22:51] <aaronmcadam> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[04:22:56] <aaronmcadam> read that and come back to us
[04:24:07] <iman> would you please some one listen to me
[04:24:37] <aaronmcadam> ?justask
[04:25:02] <aaronmcadam> goddammit we need the bot back
[04:25:10] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, l10n is short for localisation btw
[04:25:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:25:17] <aaronmcadam> I know
[04:25:27] <aaronmcadam> nice timeliness there :p
[04:26:14] <mhrowa> aaronmcadam: its all about JS at least to the point I am at
[04:26:39] <aaronmcadam> mhrowa: jQuery *is* JS
[04:26:56] <mhrowa> aint it library of JS or something like that?
[04:27:06] <aaronmcadam> yes it's just a library
[04:27:16] <aaronmcadam> you need to learn some fundamental JS first you know
[04:27:37] <mhrowa> But I know it
[04:27:44] <aaronmcadam> especially if you're asking how you *install* jQuery
[04:27:48] <aaronmcadam> there's a lot you need to learn
[04:27:57] <mhrowa> indeed
[04:28:03] <mhrowa> I have really much tu learn
[04:28:06] <mhrowa> to*
[04:28:11] <aaronmcadam> seems like you misunderstand how web development *works*
[04:28:28] <aaronmcadam> so just bare with that tutorial, it's the best for beginners
[04:28:43] <mhrowa> http://www.kriesi.at/archives/create-simple-tooltips-with-css-and-jquery I copied all the code but error occurs and it does not work
[04:29:01] <mhrowa> I am a noob. It is preety true.
[04:29:28] <aaronmcadam> I'd recommend you try not to overstretch yourself and learn the basics first
[04:29:35] <mhrowa> My current project is here: www.kurakowanka.asha.pl/hajsobiznes/skrypt.js
[04:29:43] <mhrowa> www.kurakowanka.asha.pl/hajsobiznes/
[04:31:18] <mhrowa> Juts have an error saying "Value of '$' is empty or undefined. It is not a Function object.
[04:32:09] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, good luck :)
[04:32:29] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: ahhhh help me!
[04:32:36] <mhrowa> :<
[04:32:46] <aaronmcadam> means jQuery isn't being included...
[04:32:52] <asker> hey guys i want to select by name and i have a name like that name="my[data][array]"
[04:32:56] <asker> is it possible somehow?
[04:32:57] <mhrowa> Aint nobody likes nor understands me, see ya :D
[04:33:06] <aaronmcadam> lol
[04:33:10] <blackspotwiggins> asker, escape [ and ] chars
[04:33:26] <iman> hi, look at to this http://csstooltip.com/ tooltip, it has an  arrow/triangle-like effect, how can create it, it's an image or css3 trick ?
[04:33:27] <Cork> asker: $('input[name="my[data][array]"]')
[04:33:44] <Cork> no need to escape anything
[04:33:54] <asker> $("input[name=my\[data\]\[array\]") like that?
[04:33:55] <blackspotwiggins> i remember having to do that sometimes
[04:34:04] <asker> oh ok ty
[04:34:05] <Cork> asker: quote the values
[04:34:42] <seutje> yeah, what Cork said
[04:40:42] <kladzen> hello, im trying to make a little thing.. where i click on a link.. and then is shows my div with my form inside of it.. and if i click on the link again, it should then hide the div again.. but it out works when i click the link the first time.. when i click the second time.. it won't hide the div... can somebody help me ? with this ? - http://pastebin.com/YjRPfXK3
[04:41:03] <kladzen> it only works*
[04:41:48] <xxx_> @cork: when i place panel code file in index file, slideshow code stopped working:(
[04:42:11] <blackspotwiggins> kladzen, it binds the event once, depending on the initial state
[04:42:21] <blackspotwiggins> you probably want to check it inside the handler
[04:43:19] <kladzen> blackspotwiggins: can you point me to a direction of where i can read up on this? like a tutorial or something :)?
[04:44:00] <blackspotwiggins> uhh http://jqfundamentals.com/ i guess
[04:44:08] <blackspotwiggins> try to think like a computer when looking at code
[04:44:28] <blackspotwiggins> the part directly inside document ready handler is only executed once
[04:45:24] <beasty> morning guys
[04:45:40] <xxx_> you need to be identified with services..meanz?
[04:47:35] <jeffsmykil> man is it cold outside
[04:47:42] <AdamPDotty> kladzen: maybe like this: http://pastebin.com/jVbpDAz6
[04:48:22] <AdamPDotty> not sure, if it works, else better check inside the function
[04:49:30] <blackspotwiggins> AdamPDotty, yours has the same problem
[04:49:44] <blackspotwiggins> initially only one of those selectors finds anything
[04:50:30] <AdamPDotty> but it should work, as live() was supposed to
[04:50:34] <AdamPDotty> still not sure, if it does
[04:51:09] <AdamPDotty> if you add an element, jquery checks for eventListeners to append
[04:51:21] <AdamPDotty> does it, when you change state?
[04:54:02] <shoky> on() is not live()
[04:57:22] <discorpia> shoky: true, but on() should work as a drop in replacement for live(), no?
[04:57:37] <shoky> discorpia: no, not at all
[04:58:14] <Nebros> is there one with skill in ajax and django?
[04:58:26] <siovene> Nebros: I use them both.
[04:59:16] <Cork> discorpia: there is no drop in replacement in any direction
[04:59:22] <Nebros> ok, i will put small fragments of my code into a show, just a moment :)
[04:59:29] <Cork> on is a collection of features its a collection of bind and delegate
[04:59:37] <Cork> live has no replacement at all
[04:59:55] <Cork> there is other ways to do it (better) widht delegate or on
[05:00:22] <siovene> If I have some nested AJAX calls, how can I return, from the top-level code, a promise that will be fulfilled when the last of the ajax called has been done?
[05:00:25] <discorpia> aha, i thought on could handle/recognize the live-syntax and behave accordingly
[05:00:33] <discorpia> on()*
[05:00:44] <blackspotwiggins> discorpia, how is live() syntax different from old bind() ?
[05:00:50] <Cork> discorpia: nope on can almost handle the delegate syntax (one of the arguments has been moved)
[05:01:00] <discorpia> blackspotwiggins: not at all, which is the point, no?
[05:01:13] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: live binds on document and throws away the element the selection matches
[05:01:18] <blackspotwiggins> how could it handle live syntax in a different way then
[05:01:25] <discorpia> but i thought on was to combine/get rid of all bind/live/delegate stuff
[05:01:41] <discorpia> blackspotwiggins: hmm, valid question
[05:01:53] <Cork> $('selector').live lets jquery search for the elements matching that selector; then throws away the matched elements
[05:01:57] <discorpia> get rid of it in the frontend code that is
[05:02:03] <Cork> then use the string to bind a selector on $(document)
[05:02:18] <Cork> it was a fundamental flaw in its syntax
[05:02:32] <Cork> and is why its been deprecated and removed
[05:03:13] <Cork> you can do the same thing with delegate or on; but without the extra dom search
[05:03:52] <shoky> siovene: not sure i understand the question.. you can make your own $.Deferred and .resolve() it in the nested callback, no?
[05:03:57] <Cork> $(document).delegate('selector', 'event') === $(document).on('event', 'selector') == $('selector').live('event')
[05:04:16] <Nebros> siovene: http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/1dxnx/
[05:05:04] <Nebros> siovene: all needet snippets are here... my problem: they is only "loading..." but it will not load. but why?
[05:05:07] <siovene> shoky: well I have a function called "getData()". This makes an AJAX request, and if that succeedes, there's a second AJAX request. I want the caller of "getData()" to be able to use .then() only when all the AJAX requests in getData() have completed.
[05:06:15] <siovene> Nebros: check what the the developer console of your browser tells you. Maybe there's some server side error.
[05:07:10] <siovene> shoky: to be even more detailed, getData() makes a first AJAX request to get a list of items, and then a second AJAX request to get details of the first item in that list.
[05:07:13] <Nebros> siovene, there is no error, thats my problem
[05:07:30] <shoky> siovene:  function getData() { var dfd = $.Deferred(); $.ajax.done(function(){  $.ajax(...).done( dfd.resolve ); });  return dfd.promise(); }
[05:07:33] <siovene> Nebros: does that mean that the response of your AJAX request is 200 OK?
[05:07:54] <shoky> siovene: that's $.ajax(...).done  not $.ajax.done  ;p
[05:07:58] <siovene> shoky: that looks good, I'll try it!
[05:08:04] <Nebros> ok, in ajax this variable 'SEF001105' is fail cause its hardcodet and i need it from the post
[05:10:14] <siovene> shoky: and how can I put data in that primise?
[05:10:26] <blackspotwiggins> siovene, i think i've used something like $.when([$.ajax, $.ajax $.ajax]).then(dostuff())
[05:10:42] <blackspotwiggins> not sure if you can use it tho
[05:12:00] <siovene> blackspotwiggins: and if I return that $.when, is the promise fulfilled only after all 3 are done?
[05:12:35] <blackspotwiggins> yup
[05:13:25] <blackspotwiggins> the syntax is sligthly different it seems
[05:13:30] <siovene> blackspotwiggins: and how does the second ajax call get the output of the first?
[05:13:43] <blackspotwiggins> siovene, http://www.jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.when
[05:13:52] <xxx_> my project contains  3 php files (test.php,panel.php,index.php).test.php contains code for slideshow and panel .php contains slideup and down code.wen i include only test.php file in index.php slideshow works fine.wen i include panel.php along with test.php, then slideshow breaks but slideup and down works.
[05:13:58] <blackspotwiggins> if you need to run them serially, you need something different tho
[05:13:59] <siovene> blackspotwiggins: I know I could do it using asynjs's waterfall, but I'm confused as to how to get the data in the end.
[05:14:07] <xxx_> wt to dooo?am not understanding whr the prblm is??
[05:16:21] <iman> what plugin do you use for form validation in jquery ?
[05:17:50] <paolooo> hi, is it possible to upload an image using $.ajax?
[05:19:18] <xxx_> @iman:  http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[05:19:30] <iman> xxx_: thanks
[05:22:04] <Nebros> siovene: yes its always thsi 200 ok
[05:22:04] <shoky> siovene:   you can always pass any data you want yourself when you .resolve the deferred
[05:23:00] <shoky> siovene: and using $.when  you'll get the data for all the promises in your callback
[05:25:42] <siovene> shoky: ok thanks.
[05:26:02] <siovene> Nebros: have you tried setting breakpoints in your javascrip code?
[05:27:26] <Nebros> something like this: error: function(d) { $('#rows_5').html('error'); }
[05:27:47] <Nebros> i have no errors left...
[05:27:53] <siovene> Nebros: so is your error function called?
[05:29:02] <Nebros> it was possible to red this word error whet it fails, dont know... i think yes xD
[05:29:50] <siovene> Nebros: you are misusing django. There, you probably want to use render_to_string, together with json.dumps, or perhaps a templatetag would be more adequate.
[05:32:08] <Nebros> maybe i missusing it, but it have to work :D
[05:32:45] <siovene> I think you should read up about using Ajax with Django... and a lot of other Django things :)
[05:35:55] <iman> is it wrong ?
[05:35:56] <iman> 	$('button[name=accountChargeOnline] button[name=accountChargeCard]').click(function(event){
[05:36:16] <iman> i want to say first button OR second button
[05:36:24] <blackspotwiggins> then it's wrong
[05:36:35] <iman> how can I implement that ?
[05:36:53] <blackspotwiggins> select them separately
[05:37:10] <seutje> just select both and grab first?
[05:37:13] <blackspotwiggins> the second one if the first one does not find anything
[05:37:28] <seutje> no need to actually check
[05:37:37] <blackspotwiggins> yea that works too actually
[05:38:04] <iman> select each of them separately, ok thanks

[05:39:39] <hariom> Need help in using Deferred. Case: An Ajax Get request loads a future required page (i.e. pages which user will need later on).

[05:55:34] <fabioportieri> hi, i have a div with some pics inside that showns up everytime user click a link.. issue is the div is not immediately visible since it spawns at the bottom of the page, i tried triggering focus on that div but no success.. how do i do it?
[05:56:35] <fabioportieri> ahh i have to add tabindex to the div maybe
[05:58:39] <fabioportieri> doesn't work on firefox tho
[05:58:43] <fabioportieri> another approach?

[06:10:30] <rudiX> hello
[06:10:39] <rudiX>  $('.step1').on('click',function(){    alert($(this).attr('alt'))
[06:10:46] <rudiX> I am getting undefined
[06:11:15] <rudiX> is there something new in latest jquery
[06:15:57] <rudiX> my mistake
[06:16:13] <EugenA> there is a website with a button "add to cart", onclick reloads the page. Is it possible to run remote script, if someone clicks the button?
[06:22:23] <shoky> EugenA: yes. do you mean run a remote javascript script? or a server-side script?
[06:25:00] <EugenA> shoky: I need to prepare some vars and call remote param.aspx file
[06:25:32] <EugenA> the only problem is: the webpage reloaded if I click on the button
[06:26:05] <EugenA> is it possible to wait until remote script is run and then continue with native script?
[06:26:13] <EugenA> this happens onclick
[06:27:48] <mike_chacon> I need to preventDefault of parent of parent on like 20, can anyone help? http://codepen.io/sicdigital/pen/qpIre
[06:28:15] <mike_chacon> I need to preventDefault of parent  of the selecter on line 20, can anyone help? http://codepen.io/sicdigital/pen/qpIre
[06:30:54] <shoky> EugenA you can call .preventDefault() on the event argument to prevent the reload
[06:31:31] <EugenA> shoky: i still need the normal script, but after the additional remote script is done
[06:31:59] <EugenA> shoky: how can i find out, the remote script is done??
[06:33:07] <shoky> EugenA: how are you running the remote script
[06:34:01] <EugenA> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://example.com/remote.aspx"></script>
[06:34:19] <EugenA> shoky: and I need to define some vars before, script will access them
[06:34:30] <shoky> that's html, not javascript/jquery
[06:35:07] <shoky> anyway you can try using $.getScript which has a done callback
[06:35:23] <EugenA> shoky: yes, but my question is: is it possible to run such script AND do page reload with own script running also on same button onclick
[06:36:24] <Jeroen__> Hi, I've got a menu with .elements I made with JQuery that when someone clicks an element it opens the content (everthing in the first div (.collapse). But it can open also new .elements (sub menu) how can I open those when someone clicks on it using JQuery?
[06:36:51] <shoky> .click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.getScript(url).done(function() { .. do page reload or hwatever you want .. }); })
[06:36:55] <bak2helll> hi, can i ask a jquery question here?
[06:36:58] <Jeroen__> This is what I've:
[06:36:58] <Jeroen__> http://pastebin.com/M8b0AdUv
[06:37:21] <Jeroen__> but when I click on the submenu .clickelement then it'll open the first .clickelement and not the 3th I clicked on (for example).
[06:37:33] <EugenA> shoky: thanks, will try it
[06:37:53] <shoky> Jeroen__: you should do event delegation with .on(). read about it in http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:39:06] <bak2helll> seems i can, so..why doesn't html added by append() method show on view source?
[06:39:23] <shoky> bak2helll: because view source shows the original html
[06:39:27] <zafu> hi, what is the best file upload plugin for jq ?
[06:39:32] <Jeroen__> shoky, can't I just use .click?
[06:40:01] <pachet> bak2hell: the browser usually just does a separate http request when you choose view source
[06:40:09] <shoky> Jeroen__:  doing that will only register event handlers on elements that are already in the DOM when you're calling it
[06:40:45] <Sri19> 105 tests fail for me on ubuntu / chrome ... on the master branch
[06:40:48] <Sri19> is this common
[06:40:53] <Sri19> or is master "stable"
[06:41:09] <shoky> Jeroen__: you want something like $('#menu').on('click', '.clickelement', function() { ... })
[06:41:27] <Jeroen__> Oh I did just do this:
[06:41:32] <Jeroen__> $('.clickelement').on("click", (function(){
[06:41:47] <shoky> Jeroen__: i told you to read about event delegation, not blindly switch to using .on
[06:42:03] <shoky> Jeroen__: that's doing the same exact thing as .click()
[06:42:10] <iman> how can I declare a force for user to insert an input just like that YYYY/MM/DD and not else
[06:42:26] <bak2helll> hmm..that must be the reason for my problem. i'm actually trying to get a form ready by using jQuery, when user clicks on a button a new row of input fields is added to the already present frame. however, another function in jquery checks if users focus ins in one of those fields and if he does the script set the value of the field to "". but since there's no real html, it's not working. what
[06:42:27] <bak2helll> can i do?
[06:42:40] <bak2helll> *frame->from
[06:42:43] <bak2helll> *form
[06:43:53] <shoky> bak2helll what matters at runtime is the DOM tree, not any html..
[06:44:35] <ravenzz> Cork have you solved the $.event issue?
[06:44:50] <bak2helll> i can see that the fields are being added in the DOM.
[06:45:05] <Cork> ravenzz: solved, by finding the issue stating that global events are removed; ya :)
[06:45:11] <ravenzz> I just realized that I need it :S well I am still using 1.8.3 but at some point we'll upgrade I guess
[06:45:17] <bak2helll> but when i click inside a jQuery added field the value doesn't get reset to "".
[06:45:30] <ravenzz> Cork doh
[06:45:39] <bak2helll> however the same works on the fields already present in the form(not created by jQuery)
[06:46:02] <Cork> ravenzz: what i need can be done with a few lines of code
[06:46:03] <xec> bak2helll: why would the value be reset to ""?
[06:46:03] <shoky> bak2helll sounds like you might also need to read about event delegation
[06:46:10] <ravenzz> Cork so how go for it?
[06:46:15] <Cork> my problem is i don't know if they plan to remove the cache it uses
[06:46:20] <ravenzz> I mean is there an actual alternative?
[06:46:47] <Cork> hmm possibly
[06:47:06] <Cork> ravenzz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/src/event.js
[06:47:12] <Cork> end of that file
[06:47:38] <Cork> what i need can't be done though that; but it might be enough for you
[06:48:54] <Cork> ravenzz: this is the bug that removed the support http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12989
[06:50:10] <bak2helll> i'm not sure how can delegation help me here?
[06:50:17] <ravenzz> so am I supposed to bind on document instead?
[06:50:27] <mike_chacon> I need to preventDefault of parent  of the selecter on line 20, can anyone help? http://codepen.io/sicdigital/pen/qpIre
[06:50:28] <mike_chacon> \
[06:50:29] <shoky> bak2helll i might've misunderstood you
[06:50:31] <Cork> ravenzz: if you want ajaxStart; yes
[06:50:40] <slons> how does jquery mobile handle ios6 setinterval/timeout not binding on scroll in ios6?
[06:50:41] <slons> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12683510/ios-6-safari-setinterval-doesnt-get-fired
[06:50:51] <Cork> ravenzz: if you want a global event you can do what that special event handler does there
[06:51:27] <bak2helll> wait, let me show you the code..
[06:51:55] <wongon> In the console of FF, I can enter jQuery(), and it returns a [].  But entering a $() returns undef.  Anybody know why?
[06:52:10] <slons> have callbacks in ios6 been something that jquery mobile has had to address specifically?
[06:52:19] <Cork> wongon: firebug has its own $ variable
[06:52:20] <ravenzz> Cork so pushing my event into that special obj/array?
[06:52:21] <Cork> and thats not jquery
[06:52:39] <Cork> slons: you can do $ = window.jQuery and it should work just fine
[06:52:49] <Cork> (theres a pref you can change too)
[06:53:07] <Cork> ravenzz: you can register the event as a special event
[06:53:18] <lobbin> Can I configure a jQuery Mobile grid to use one column if enough space on screen and two columns otherwise?
[06:53:32] <Cork> ravenzz: so when on registeres it it trigger that setup handler; that adds it on document with that special magic
[06:54:17] <jaffipaffi> Hello, I have a little problem. When a select is changed, I'm running a script that sets selected="selected" on the select. It's because otherwise when it's cloned, it won't keep the selected value. However, as you can see, it adds multiple selected="selected" when you're choosing more items. How can I remove the previous selected="selected" and only add selected="selected" to the currently selected? http://jsfiddle.net/SxEbN/
[06:54:17] <Cork> ravenzz: that has to be done once for every event you want that to work for though (before they are ever used)
[06:54:26] <ravenzz> I see, but it is someting doable in jQuery 1.8.3?
[06:54:32] <Cork> yes
[06:54:46] <Cork> special event has been in jquery since at least 1.4
[06:55:16] <ravenzz> does special is another word to say custom?
[06:55:19] <ravenzz> I guess..
[06:55:39] <Cork> ravenzz: custom is just events that isn't default as far as i know
[06:56:00] <Cork> this creates a structure that is called when an event is bound and when the element is removed
[06:56:24] <ravenzz> in my own specific case I am dealing with a custom event
[06:56:32] <ravenzz> that's why I am asking
[06:56:50] <Cork> custom events works just fine with no need to change anything
[06:57:06] <Cork> its when you want to call without a target element that things gets sticky
[06:57:10] <superdmp> can you tell me whether http://dpaste.org/3zf9L/ should: match all elements with ids starting "id_links_item", and then create an alert for each one?
[06:57:25] <ravenzz> Cork which is my own case :p
[06:57:37] <superdmp> and is that substantially the right way to do that sort of thing?
[06:57:45] <Cork> superdmp: you SHOULD use a class for those id's
[06:57:46] <bak2helll> here it is: http://pastebin.com/3Kc4Uknt
[06:57:54] <Cork> superdmp: and then select the class not based on id's
[06:57:57] <bak2helll> please see if you can find what's wrong
[06:58:18] <superdmp> Cork:  ok, why is that?
[06:58:24] <jaffipaffi> Anyone?
[06:58:30] <Cork> superdmp: what your doing there isn't selecting based on id; you select based on attributes
[06:58:41] <Cork> superdmp: you go the slowest route possible
[06:58:59] <shoky> jaffipaffi: i'd just copy the value when cloning:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/SxEbN/1/
[06:59:05] <Cork> superdmp: first you select all select elements; then you look for the id attribute on those elements
[06:59:17] <Cork> superdmp: then you check the value of that attribute
[06:59:23] <ravenzz> Cork i'll play with that... thank you btw
[06:59:34] <Cork> superdmp: instead of doing a quick dom lookup for the element in the reference tables
[06:59:42] <Cork> ravenzz: np
[06:59:42] <shoky> jaffipaffi: oops that should be .clone()  not .clone(true)
[07:00:05] <superdmp> Cork:  this is not  real-world thing, I am just trying to learn the concepts
[07:00:35] <slons> cork: I don't think that addresses the issue.  there is a bug with ios6 and callbacks getting registered during scroll events
[07:00:38] <bak2helll> anyone?
[07:00:53] <slons> is that something jquery mobile has had to work around?
[07:01:08] <Clex> I'm a random DOM element. How do I know how many children my parent have before me?
[07:01:09] <superdmp> for example, why does the alert(this) return "[object HTMLDocument]"?
[07:01:27] <shoky> bak2helll: event delegation is your friend
[07:01:29] <Cork> superdmp: $('#id') super fast; $('.class') REALLY fast; $('element') depends but never fast; $('element[attribute]') show; $('element[name|= or &= or *=]') really slow; $('element:contains()') super slow
[07:01:44] <Cork> superdmp: ya so you should learn how it should be solved from the start
[07:02:24] <shoky> bak2helll:  $('#content_mid').on('focusin', 'table[id=job_intake] input[type=text]', function() { this.value = ""; })
[07:02:28] <Cork> slons: what does ios6 have to do with the firebug console?
[07:02:49] <Clex> Found my answer: index().
[07:03:29] <Cork> superdmp: id's should be used when you want to address one element; and one element only; class should be used intensively to group type of elements together; don't be afraid of adding classes to elements
[07:03:31] <slons> Cork: different issue
[07:03:45] <superdmp> Cork:  thanks a lot, that is helpful
[07:03:45] <Cork> slons: well it was what i answered
[07:04:07] <slons> Cork: I thought you were responding to "how does jquery mobile handle ios6 setinterval/timeout not binding on scroll in ios6?
[07:04:07] <slons> 9:50 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12683510/ios-6-safari-setinterval-doesnt-get-fired"
[07:04:25] <superdmp> Cork:  though to a certain extent I am also having to work out what will work with things not entirely under my control
[07:04:28] <Cork> slons: i've only played with jquery-mobile
[07:04:37] <bak2helll> no no, i want the values to be null when someone when someone clicks inside the text input field, not when he clicks the division holding them
[07:04:39] <dcherman> Clex: that's incorrect, that'll give you the position in the current jquery set, not all previous siblings.  ?see prevall
[07:04:51] <shoky> bak2helll: you obviously don't understand event delegation
[07:04:55] <Cork> superdmp: ya, i know the feeling
[07:04:59] <shoky> bak2helll: read about it in http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:05:16] <Cork> superdmp: in those cases its prob better to use a hierarchy search instead of an attribute search
[07:05:20] <Clex> dcherman: $(this).parent().children().index(this) what's the problem?
[07:05:36] <bak2helll> wait let me try
[07:05:37] <Cork> superdmp:  something like $('#wrapping-parent select')
[07:05:49] <superdmp> Cork: ultimately I will actually be able to go straight for $('#id') I think
[07:06:07] <dcherman> Clex: oh i guess that'll work.  prevAll is likely faster, but will accomplish the same thing.
[07:06:22] <Cork> superdmp: but as you have to look and search manually in js to do |=  *= and the like; they should be your last option
[07:06:31] <Clex> dcherman: 'k, I'll check it out, thanks.
[07:06:42] <superdmp> my plan is to take this: https://github.com/evildmp/django-widgetry/blob/master/widgetry/templates/widgetry/fk_lookup/widget.html which inserts the script for each instance of a widget, and have it loaded once at the start, so that it work on all and any future instances of the widget
[07:06:55] <Cork> superdmp: by personal experience doing everything by id isn't always the best option
[07:06:59] <shoky> bak2helll: the important part is the 2nd argument to .on()
[07:07:19] <Cork> superdmp: its better to try to write the js so it works in relation with a position in the dom
[07:07:42] <Cork> ex by looking for a class in siblings to the target element for an event or smilar
[07:07:47] <bak2helll> it's not working :(
[07:07:56] <shoky> ?demo @ bak2helll
[07:07:59] <shoky> eh
[07:08:04] <Cork> superdmp: that way you don't have to rewrite the code; just to make it work with another section with the same logic
[07:08:33] <bak2helll> my bad, forgot the quotes around focusin
[07:08:33] <Cork> superdmp: ex. form validation is a good example
[07:08:39] <bak2helll> working like charm
[07:08:41] <superdmp> Cork:  unfortunately, the issue I have here is that when a new widget is added (by Django's add a new inline item functionality) it does not work with the script in that little template
[07:09:18] <Cork> superdmp: instead of doing $('#password').val() == rule; you do $(this).find('.password.required').each(validate);
[07:09:19] <superdmp> which is why having repeated instances of the script is not working, and why I want to try loading one that catches all
[07:09:25] <bak2helll> but i still don't get why wasn't it working in my script
[07:09:29] <bak2helll> :/
[07:09:38] <shoky> bak2helll did you read about event delegation..
[07:09:42] <bak2helll> sorry for the face..kinda in my habit
[07:10:03] <bak2helll> yes, but um..
[07:10:11] <Cork> superdmp: ya, just giving some base things to think of
[07:10:12] <shoky> bak2helll:  doing  $('.bla').click(function(){...})  will look for elements matching .bla  that are CURRENTLY in the dom
[07:10:14] <bak2helll> got no idea what it said
[07:10:28] <shoky> bak2helll: and it will attach event listernes only to those elements that it CURRENTLY finds in the dom
[07:10:40] <bak2helll> ok
[07:11:03] <shoky> bak2helll: so your new rows weren't in the DOM at the time you called $(whatever).click
[07:11:18] <shoky> bak2helll: so the new inputs on the new rows did not get any event listeners attached to them
[07:11:24] <shoky> bak2helll: so, it didnt work
[07:11:35] <superdmp> Cork:  so I could do something like: $('[thing that matches]').each([execute some function])
[07:11:45] <Cork> superdmp: sure
[07:12:08] <Cork> superdmp: but that wasn't only the point of that line
[07:12:29] <superdmp> Cork:  no i realise, you were showing me faster finding
[07:12:30] <Cork> superdmp: its to have classes that tells the script what to do in relation to the wrapping parent
[07:12:32] <slons> Has anyone else experienced this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12683510/ios-6-safari-setinterval-doesnt-get-fired
[07:12:55] <Cork> superdmp: and not make the script control what element it matches
[07:13:07] <bak2helll> but it was listening to the events, right? so wouldn't it be listening after i added the rows? or does it executes the listening part just once?
[07:13:16] <Cork> that way you can control the script by simply adding classes to elements
[07:13:25] <bak2helll> wait, that doesn't make sense
[07:13:28] <shoky> bak2helll: event listeners are attached to elements. there were no elements to attach the listeners to
[07:13:30] <Cork> without having to change a single line of code
[07:13:35] <superdmp> thanks, I'll take it in a bit at a time!
[07:15:03] <bak2helll> so what your code is actually doing is, it's attaching a listener to the parent that works on the child of it..if there are any, it's good, if there aren't, still good.
[07:15:06] <bak2helll> right?
[07:15:17] <shoky> bak2helll: more or less, yeah..
[07:15:31] <bak2helll> ok, maybe i got it.
[07:15:34] <bak2helll> thanks
[07:15:42] <shoky> np
[07:15:48] <jaffipaffi> shoky: Not really useful as I clone a whole block containing lots of elements. As you can see, text entered in input fields are remembered, only the selected value isn't selected: http://jsfiddle.net/SxEbN/2/
[07:16:03] <jaffipaffi> So I'm setting selected="selected" to make it "remember" the selected index in the cloned div
[07:16:32] <perplexa_> Hi
[07:16:32] <shoky> jaffipaffi: well you can always .removeAttr('selected') on all the <option>s first
[07:16:46] <perplexa_> Spricht hier jemand deutsch
[07:16:46] <perplexa_> :)
[07:16:56] <perplexa_> BrÃ¤uchte hilfe zu einem jquery Problem
[07:17:05] <Cork> perplexa_: english please
[07:17:23] <shoky> jaffipaffi: $(this).children().removeAttr('selected').filter(':selected').attr('selected','selected')  or smth
[07:17:37] <shoky> oops
[07:18:01] <Cork> O_o
[07:18:18] <Cork> shoky: you know that selected isn't added to options just cause you change a value in the select right?
[07:18:41] <jaffipaffi> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/SxEbN/3/ hmm.. doesn't work :/
[07:18:50] <shoky> Cork: of course, we're following up on something he asked earlier
[07:18:59] * Cork nods
[07:19:04] <shoky> he added the attr himself
[07:19:11] <Cork> ah
[07:19:28] <shoky> jaffipaffi yea sec
[07:22:26] <jaffipaffi> shoky: Have a fix... http://jsfiddle.net/SxEbN/4/
[07:22:58] <shoky> jaffipaffi me too.. if jsfiddle werent so slow
[07:23:28] <jaffipaffi> Yeah it's darn slow
[07:23:34] <shoky> jaffipaffi: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/SxEbN/6/
[07:24:33] <BillCriswell> jsbin for the win.
[07:24:49] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle for the... piddle.
[07:25:04] <jaffipaffi> shoky: That works great too! :)
[07:25:35] <jaffipaffi> However the clone() fix I added is a little easier
[07:25:50] <jaffipaffi> The jQuery team should make a commit with that anyways
[07:26:04] <djQuery> mornin
[07:26:24] <Cork> evening :P
[07:30:20] <mads-> Is there a jquery way to list all the mousemove event listeners attached to the dom?
[07:32:04] <jaffipaffi> mads-: What about .data() ?
[07:32:17] <mads-> jaffipaffi, I don't know :)
[07:33:57] <Cork> mads-: yes, but not in an official (so it might break in the next release)
[07:33:57] <jaffipaffi> mads-: jQuery._data( elem, "events" );
[07:34:20] <Cork> and it doesn't list native event listeners
[07:34:45] <pachet> you're probably SOL if you want a list of all native event listeners
[07:35:17] <Cork> ya
[07:35:23] <Cork> there is no list of that at all
[07:35:44] <Cork> (well there is internally in the browser; but not exposed to js)
[07:37:19] <jaffipaffi> mads-: Use this: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[07:37:53] <mads-> Thanks
[07:40:02] <MalMen> if i change a value in one input with onclick that onchange() is not activated ?
[07:40:58] <Cork> MalMen: onchange is triggered when the user changes something
[07:41:15] <Cork> (and sometime its when the user changes something and moves focus)
[07:41:34] <Cork> it never reacts to script changing things
[07:41:36] <MalMen> hmmm, there any function for when a script change something ?
[07:42:01] <BillCriswell> MalMen: Depends how it's "changed".
[07:43:16] <Cork> MalMen: no, you would have to use a wrapper function that notifies you
[07:43:36] <Cork> MalMen: there isn't any events for script changes in any form
[07:44:58] <MalMen> this selector is valid $("#msgcode #lang").change(function() {?
[07:45:19] <Cork> MalMen: its valid but pointless
[07:45:31] <Cork> ("#lang").change(function() { is enough
[07:45:32] <MalMen> why ?
[07:45:38] <Cork> cause id's has to be uniq
[07:45:43] <MalMen> but its 2 destincts objects
[07:45:55] <Cork> then they have to have different id's
[07:46:02] <Cork> or you should be using class instead
[07:46:16] <shoky> i think he wants "#msgcode, #lang"
[07:46:22] <Cork> ah
[07:46:30] * Cork nods
[07:47:14] * Cork updates his cssFix parser
[07:47:16] <Cork> :)
[07:47:20] <M4d3L> hi. I use the validation plugin, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation and when I do some ajax validation stuff in the submitHandler, than force  $(form).submit(); it turn in loop in the submithandler.
[07:48:15] <M4d3L> how do I skip validation form and submit the form without revalidate?
[07:48:21] <MalMen> shoky is that :D thank you
[07:52:30] <[jmc]> hello
[07:52:42] <spaceman817> Is anyone familiar with an $.ajax call to a python script? I'm following this example to a T (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10718572/post-json-to-python-cgi), but it keeps returning my entire python script... the success function in the ajax call doesn't get called either
[07:52:46] <[jmc]> I'm experiencing a problem with jQuery UI
[07:53:04] <[jmc]> I have a couple of <input type="number"/> elements
[07:53:16] <spaceman817> sorry, this example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10721244/ajax-posting-to-python-cgi
[07:53:34] <[jmc]> but since that is not equally supported across browser, I have also chosen to use the Spinner widget from jQuery UI
[07:54:20] <[jmc]> the problem is, on browsers like Chrome (which supports that element type), I see both the arrows of the <input> element and the arrows of the Spinner widget
[07:54:25] <[jmc]> any known workaround?
[07:59:28] <shoky> spacebarbarian_: dataType: 'json'
[07:59:35] <shoky> spaceman817 that is
[07:59:42] <stewbydoo> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/QQKfu/1/ and what I want to do is with the click of a button toggle it to bounce in and if they click the same button toggle out with a fadeout
[07:59:56] <stewbydoo> not sure what I am missing with mine
[08:00:47] <spaceman817> shoky: yea, i fixed that type in the ajax call, but it's still returning a 200 with my entire script
[08:01:23] <shoky> spaceman817:  i dont really know python but.. what are you doing in that pyhton script? why are you reading stdin?
[08:02:09] <spaceman817> shoky: I was using sys.stdout.write since it was in the example, but i've also seen others with 'print' instead - but both give me the same results
[08:02:15] <shoky> spaceman817: also   data: {'param':{"hello":"world"}},   will probably not do what you want it to
[08:02:35] <shoky> spaceman817: huh? that doesnt answer my question..
[08:02:36] <superdmp> can I get the web inspector in Safari to tell me what jQuery functions are attached to a particular element?
[08:03:01] <stewbydoo> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/QQKfu/1/ and what I want to do is with the click of a button toggle it to bounce in and if they click the same button toggle out with a fadeout
[08:03:04] <stewbydoo> not sure what I am missing with mine
[08:03:06] <spaceman817> ah i think you're looking at the first example I linked by mistake, I linked the second one that I meant to link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10721244/ajax-posting-to-python-cgi
[08:03:22] <shoky> spaceman817: thats what im looking at
[08:03:56] <spaceman817> shoky: the first answer on that one
[08:04:18] <shoky> oh, didnt notice there are answers
[08:05:21] <Mottie1> I think the ajax data option automatically stringifies any data
[08:05:34] <shoky> spaceman817:  there's a small mistake there, datatype instead of dataType  but i doubt thats the problem
[08:06:51] <Mottie1> jmc: just use a input type text if you're using the jQuery UI spinner
[08:07:14] <spaceman817> shoky: yea i fixed that one, still no luck
[08:07:44] <shoky> spaceman817: what do you mean its returning the entire script.. the python code itself is sent..?
[08:08:14] <[jmc]> Mottie1, yes, but using native input types is my preferred choice whenever I can, since it has its advantages (e.g., it indicates mobile browsers to display a numerical keyboard)
[08:08:27] <spaceman817> shoky: yea, the python code/script in its entirety
[08:08:54] <shoky> spaceman817: welp that's definitely a question for #python
[08:09:01] <spaceman817> shoky: but i only see that in the google network inspector... it doesn't actually initiate the alert call in the success function
[08:09:30] <shoky> spaceman817: yeah thats to be expected if it returns python code ;p
[08:09:37] <Mottie1> jmc: I understand that, but I don't think there is any way to detect if an input type number is supported in a browser... maybe try http://modernizr.com/
[08:10:18] <shoky> spaceman817: are you sure python is even working? and your apache is hooked right for it?
[08:10:29] <M4d3L> how to submit a form like $(form).submit(); without loop again into validation?
[08:10:51] <[jmc]> Mottie1, I think I have found a workaround (to test for support, $('selector').attr('type)==='number'), and this is a way to hide the chrome's spin buttons: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975769/disable-webkits-spin-buttons-on-input-type-number
[08:12:21] <spaceman817> shoky: ahh, i'm able to execute python in the terminal.. didn't realize i'd have to configure apache for it
[08:13:33] <Mottie1> jmc: sorry so what's the problem then?
[08:15:10] <[jmc]> Mottie1, no problem right now... but before discovering that thread, I didn't know how to hide the spin buttons
[08:15:21] <Mottie1> ahh ok :P
[08:22:08] <Mottie1> stewbydoo: try this http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/QQKfu/2/  wow jsFiddle is being slow
[08:29:01] <iman> this regex is for validate DD/MM/YYYY, how can i convert it to validate just this format, YYYY/MM/DD /^(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[\/](0?[1-9]|1[012])[\/]\d{4}$/
[08:29:26] <Phil-Work> iman, rearrange it
[08:29:33] <Phil-Work> [\/]
[08:29:40] <Phil-Work> that's your separator
[08:29:42] <Phil-Work> i.e. /
[08:29:46] <Phil-Work> so flip the parts around
[08:31:10] <iman> Phil-Work: something like, \d{4}$/[\/](0?[1-9]|1[012])[\/]/^(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
[08:31:21] <Phil-Work> possibly
[08:31:29] <Phil-Work> brain is too fried to want to read/digest that
[08:31:31] <Phil-Work> tias
[08:32:00] <iman> Phil-Work: SyntaxError: illegal character [Break On This Error] 	var dateReg = \d{4}$/[\/](0?[1-9]|1[012])[\/]/^(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
[08:33:10] <Phil-Work> /^\d{4}[\/](0?[1-9]|1[012])[\/](0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])$/
[08:33:17] <Phil-Work> not tested, but that's what I meant by re-arranging
[08:34:15] <iman> Phil-Work: it works, thank you, but i have an other question
[08:34:24] <iman> Phil-Work: my language in persian
[08:34:34] <iman> Phil-Work: we have some number like , Û± Û² Û³ Û´ Ûµ
[08:34:42] <iman> Phil-Work: can you see these character ?
[08:34:57] <Phil-Work> I can
[08:35:01] <Phil-Work> look a bit like trees :P
[08:35:27] <iman> Phil-Work: woow, there are persian number, what do you think about validate these number in date
[08:35:59] <Phil-Work> iman, no idea :S
[08:36:11] <Phil-Work> never tried to do regex on anything but ASCII
[08:36:45] <iman> Phil-Work: can I declare them as character ?
[08:37:54] <Phil-Work> honestly no idea
[08:38:29] <iman> Phil-Work: :) thank you dude
[08:38:46] <Mottie1> iman: maybe try converting the numbers first: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10862211/birt-report-convert-numbers-to-persian-numbers
[08:38:58] <Mottie1> errr or after
[08:40:12] <iman> Mottie1: thanks you, i'm trying to test it
[08:42:47] <iman> Morthez_: it just convert english number to persian number, but how can i use that in this case
[08:42:55] <iman> Morthez_: sorry
[08:43:05] <iman> Mottie1:  it just convert english number to persian number, but how can i use that in this case
[08:43:59] <Mottie1> validate the date in YYYY/MM/DD format then convert it?
[08:45:22] <ShooterMG> If a parent window loads up jQuery, and an iFrame loads up a different version of jQuery, are there two versions of jQuery in the DOM? Or does the iFrame overwrite the parent version? Or none of these?
[08:45:40] <Mottie1> they are separate
[08:45:51] <ShooterMG> awesome
[08:45:56] <ShooterMG> thanks :)
[08:46:00] <Mottie1> np
[08:46:25] <iman> Mottie1: then I coudn't use regex
[08:46:34] <iman> i have t validate it manually
[08:47:10] <Mottie1> I meant use the regex first to validate the enlish (latin) numbers, then convert the validated numbers into persian
[08:47:58] <iman> Mottie1: but i want force user to enter date with persian number
[08:48:28] <Mottie1> can you convert the persian number into latin numbers?
[08:48:42] <Mottie1> the opposite of the answer on stackoverflow
[08:49:02] <iman> Mottie1: wooow, i find, thanks
[08:49:34] <iman> Mottie1: first i get number as persian and convert it to english and then validate with regex, then convert them to persian
[08:49:48] <Mottie1> only way I can think of doing it
[08:49:50] <Mottie1> actually
[08:49:54] <Mottie1> it's a date right?
[08:50:11] <Mottie1> can't you just do a new Date() and have the locale set to persian?
[08:50:32] <Mottie1> if the new Date() is valid it should return a date object
[08:50:42] <iman> Mottie1: i don't know, is it possible, there are something like that in java but i don't know about js
[08:51:40] <Mottie1> try it... new Date("persian numbers here");
[08:52:43] <iman> Mottie1: let me check it
[08:54:59] <iman> Mottie1: Date {Invalid Date}
[08:56:44] <b-lew1> is there a way to start with this div .mylisting-main closed? http://pastie.org/5848683
[08:58:11] <Mottie1> iman: honestly, I don't know... maybe try asking your question on http://stackoverflow.com/
[08:58:32] <Mottie1> iman: share an example of a persian date too
[08:58:34] <iman> Mottie1: ok, thank you for putting time :)
[09:00:21] <Mottie1> b-lew1: try adding a .trigger('click') after the click function
[09:00:57] <b-lew1> Mottie1 do you have an example?
[09:01:21] <b-lew1> will that start with the toggle closed?
[09:01:52] <Mottie1> well the function is set to toggle, so if it is now starting open, then yes
[09:02:00] <Mottie1> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/VvZDm/
[09:03:41] <b-lew1> closeâ€¦ I'm working with the div at the bottom of the page. http://landpros.turnpostinteractive.com/LandPros_Details2_1.html#
[09:04:01] <b-lew1> Mottie1 how do I get the header to follow so it starts out at the bottom of the page as well?
[09:05:16] <b-lew1> I have an idea
[09:06:41] <b-lew1> perfect! Thanks so much Mottie1!!!
[09:06:49] <Mottie1> lol I didn't do anything
[09:11:31] <b-lew1> Meh, you helped out!
[09:18:44] <jrajav> What kind of validation should be done on random data to be inserted into an HTML attribute? Just escape double quotes with a backslash?
[09:20:12] <jrajav> Or replace them with &quot;?
[09:26:50] <Phoenixz> With the jquery listview, is there a way to have the icons on the left side instead of the right? With buttons I can do this using data-iconpos="left", but so far this has not worked on listview items.. anybody?
[09:27:02] <Phoenixz> correction: jquery mobile listview..
[09:38:55] <JakeA> Been thinking about the requestanimationframe problemâ€¦
[09:39:13] <JakeA> actually, wrong channel...
[09:42:43] <greengriminal> any one got any ideas how maybe I would go about using autocomplete on a table cell. Its just that I have a table full of cells and would like to be able to click on a cell and input someones name inside it using autocomplete.
[09:43:08] <greengriminal> Or alternatively is there a way in which you could click a cell and a list pops up full of names?
[09:43:37] <dotnetted> Hey all - What do I have to do to get .toggle() to set my span back to inline instead of block? I've tried setting 'display: inline;' explicitely on inline and external css for my span
[09:43:47] <dotnetted> it keeps getting set to display: block on unhide
[09:44:47] <Cork> dotnetted: do you set them to display:none manually?
[09:44:50] <Vill> can you paste something?
[09:45:13] <Cork> dotnetted: jquery depends on it hiding elements so it knows what display it should have
[09:45:16] <Vill> he had to, otherwise it wouldn't unhide that
[09:45:30] <Cork> so leave display on its default value and use .hide() in dom ready
[09:45:37] <dotnetted> Cork: nope - using toggle() on an unmolested span :) - ill jsfddle it now
[09:45:59] <dotnetted> the span is initially visible
[09:47:21] <greengriminal> So i guess something like this isn't possible then?
[09:47:43] <Cork> greengriminal: it is, but i don't know of any ready plugins for it
[09:47:46] <dotnetted> http://jsfiddle.net/eMSzb/ - it's not pretty
[09:48:06] <Mottie1> greengriminal: check this out https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-make-jquery-autocomplete-to-work-for-a-contenteditable-div-instead-of-just-input-textarea-fields
[09:48:07] <dotnetted> hit Toggle twice and the span will be display: block (in Firefox at the moment)
[09:48:39] <greengriminal> Mottie1: Cheers having a look now
[09:49:17] <Cork> dotnetted: position:absolute can't be inline
[09:49:32] <dotnetted> ah
[09:49:36] <Cork> you might be looking for position: relative
[09:50:19] <dotnetted> I need the span to act as a popup when it shows though
[09:50:42] <Cork> well you have to pick :)
[09:50:47] <Cork> either inline or absolute
[09:50:54] <Cork> they are exclusive :)
[09:51:15] <Cork> you could add an extra anchor element
[09:51:23] <dotnetted> so what's the best idea for a popup dropdown that appears to the right of an input box - I dont want the dropdown to interfere with the rest of the document
[09:51:30] <Cork> and let the first be position: relative and the second be position: absolute
[09:52:46] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. Is there a ui class that I can use to theme odd and even rows, so it fits with the jquery-ui theme I am using?
[09:53:20] <dotnetted> Cork: where do you suggest adding that 2nd anchor?
[09:53:32] <noregret> can someone help with this please, http://pastie.org/5849244
[09:53:48] <Cork> dotnetted: <span id="foo">span>i'm the tooltip</span></span>
[09:54:01] <Cork> *<span id="foo"><span>i'm the tooltip</span></span>
[09:54:14] <foo> $("#gform_submit_button_1").click(submit_gravity_form); - submit_gravity_form is a function. It has an arg when it's defined (eg function submit_gravity_form(e)) - when it's called like the first way I pasted (when clicked), does something get passed as an arg ? It would seem that that method versus just calling submit_gravity_form() is different.
[09:54:44] <dotnetted> Cork: thanks mucho ;) works great
[09:56:24] <Cork> noregret: 1. \ is an escape character so you need to use them twice to get a  \; 2. urls uses slash not backslash
[09:56:32] <Mottie1> SmokeyD: in my fork of tablesorter (http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-ui-theme.html) I use "ui-widget-content" and "ui-state-default", then I set css for the row to hide the background image (https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/blob/master/css/theme.jui.css#L70)
[09:57:09] <Cork> noregret: and please ask the questions in the channel, so ppl don't have to load the pb to know if they can help you
[09:57:51] <noregret> Cork: yes, I know, can't I escape that string ? and this is a local dir, not a url
[09:58:01] <Cork> noregret: doens't matter
[09:58:11] <Cork> its file:somethin/
[09:58:13] * foo is stumped 
[09:58:40] <Cork> and you should never use absolute paths for local urls as that will get blocked in some browsers
[09:59:17] <noregret> Cork: im using a php framework that generates the local path and back/slashes using constants
[09:59:48] <zulu-gula> why this does not work on click just delay? http://jsfiddle.net/QRNZN/
[10:00:01] <zulu-gula> and when there is no delay function, close works well
[10:01:23] <Cork> noregret: browsers won't care
[10:01:38] <foo> aha! the answer is yes.
[10:01:39] <Cork> noregret: no browser will look at that as a valid css url
[10:01:59] <Cork> noregret: only is allow \ in the url; but then you need to give it a drive letter too
[10:02:06] <Cork> *only ie
[10:02:59] <Cork> for the rest of the sane browser market that's just an invalid url
[10:03:30] <noregret> thanks
[10:04:11] <Cork> a correct url would be something like file://c|/images/path/image.png
[10:04:31] <Cork> though access outside the loading folder is normally blocked
[10:05:04] <jedimind> zulu-gula, http://jsfiddle.net/QRNZN/1/
[10:05:12] <jedimind> works just fine if you comment out the delayed version
[10:05:43] <zulu-gula> jedimind, thank you
[10:05:44] <jedimind> or alternatively use .stop() http://jsfiddle.net/QRNZN/2/
[10:05:53] <jedimind> to stop the other more general delay that's happening
[10:06:05] <jedimind> zulu-gula, ^
[10:07:34] <foo> Ok, it looks like click(), when used like this: $("#gform_submit_button_1").click(submit_gravity_form); will pass an arg to function submit_gravity_form. Right?
[10:08:09] <zulu-gula> jedimind, first not working as it should - message is not disappearing after time
[10:08:15] <zulu-gula> but second works perfectly
[10:08:26] <jedimind> what do you mean after time?
[10:08:34] <jedimind> you trying to delay it after clicking?
[10:08:53] <bradmaxs> I have four divs all with the classes .destination_click and .destination_num where num is an auto-incrementing number.  I want to find what the number of that second class is so I can append content to that div rather than the other ones. http://jsfiddle.net/WCEnS/1/
[10:11:52] <bradmaxs> http://jsfiddle.net/WCEnS/2/ forgot some code:)
[10:12:41] <shoky> foo: the event object is passed as argument to event handlers, yes
[10:14:46] <foo> shoky: here's what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/AZezb/1/ - how can I get the event object passed on line 11 of jquery? I want f to be what e is (event object)
[10:15:58] <foo> shoky: (thanks a ton for responding, I apparently never knew of this so when I modified some code it broke things, heh, #learning)
[10:16:21] <shoky> foo: you can add an eevent argument to that anonymous function() on the last line
[10:17:17] <foo> shoky: aha, I see. That'd be perfect. How would I go about doing that?
[10:17:30] <shoky> foo:  function(e) { ... }
[10:17:32] * foo must be confused somewhere here
[10:17:35] <foo> shoky: OHH.
[10:17:39] <foo> haha, that makes sense.
[10:18:07] <foo> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/AZezb/3/ - thank you :)
[10:18:19] <shoky> np ;]
[10:20:32] <N704FN> dotnetted:  I see you already found a solution.  I'm not trying to step on toes or cause confusion, but would this also work for you?  http://jsfiddle.net/machouinard/XvMLS/1/
[10:23:20] <dotnetted> N704FN: thanks!
[10:27:55] <N704FN> dotnetted:  You're welcome.  I joined after you initially asked your question.  Is that what you were looking for?  I'm just trying to help as I learn and learn as I help (and read).

[10:31:59] <djQuery> sorry ment the version of jquery ui
[10:33:55] <Mottie1> $.ui.version
[10:34:14] <djQuery> Mottie1, not workin for some reason
[10:34:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it ethical to use HTML code inside a title='...' attribute of a link?
[10:34:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> like title='line1<br />line2'
[10:34:38] <Mottie1> ethical? LOL sure you can
[10:35:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I mean is it valid html? :p
[10:35:23] <Mottie1> tooltips do it all the time
[10:35:31] <Mottie1> I don't know if it's "valid" valid
[10:35:45] <Mottie1> but it should be if everything is escaped properly
[10:36:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a div with an UL inside that I want to squeeze into the title attr
[10:36:49] <Mottie1> I've put entire tables into a title attribute... for a tooltip
[10:37:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[10:37:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> actually it shows the HTML when I hover, not the rendered html
[10:38:21] <Mottie1> which is why you need a tooltip
[10:38:29] <djQuery> grrrrr alll I get back is @VERSION   http://jsbin.com/apatir/2/edit
[10:38:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I use a tooltip
[10:38:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but that tooltip uses the title attribute and just adds a nice border and bg
[10:39:12] <djQuery> ecky--ptang-zoob, think he is meaning a tooltip plugin,
[10:39:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yeah I have that
[10:39:32] <shoky> djQuery: because that's what the git version has as its version
[10:39:32] <Mottie1> yeah a tooltip plugin
[10:39:48] <djQuery> ecky--ptang-zoob, see ?ui.tooltip
[10:40:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :o
[10:40:19] <obert> :A
[10:41:16] <Mottie1> djQuery: yeah the git version doesn't have a version number assigned to it.. it's bleeding edge
[10:41:17] <BillCriswell> What do you guys call yourselves on your resumes?
[10:41:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I already made a custom jquery ui package but it does not include that tooltip ui thingy...
[10:41:22] <Mottie1> Fred
[10:41:26] <BillCriswell> Mottie1: Haha.
[10:41:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can it be included seperately?
[10:42:32] <BillCriswell> I see all these job postings and I just have no idea what I should consider myself?
[10:42:50] <Mottie1> ecky: just make sure to include dependencies
[10:42:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is that tooltip new in jquery UI?
[10:42:59] <Mottie1> not that new
[10:43:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cause I don't have it in my version
[10:43:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 1.8 i have
[10:43:47] <Mottie1> 1.10 is out
[10:44:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> not in google code yet :(
[10:44:45] <Mottie1> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/jquery-ui.js  http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:45:40] <zubelgenubi> hey I have a jquery mobile app that's slow in bb due to the (relatively) heavy js. Will it be faster if I phonegap it?
[10:46:33] <KWhat_Work> Anyone have suggestions for tracking down a rouge submit event?
[10:47:58] <zim> Hi all. Has anyone used/played with Redactor? Is it good/worth $99 ? are there any open source wysiwyg that are as polished?
[10:49:16] <zim> KWhat_Work: step through the code in firebug or add alert('event name') to your events.
[10:49:27] <zim> KWhat_Work: is this in a form?
[10:49:44] <KWhat_Work> zim: yes, I am getting a submit event on a button click
[10:49:45] <zim> KWhat_Work: and is it a Button?
[10:50:18] <Phoenixz> With the jquery mobile listview, is there a way to have the icons on the left side instead of the right? With buttons I can do this using data-iconpos="left", but so far this has not worked on listview items.. anybody
[10:50:20] <BillCriswell> KWhat_Work: What's it doing you don't like?
[10:50:23] <zim> I had this yesterday :-) not a rouge its the browser
[10:51:08] <zim> add type="button" to the button as if no type the the browser just makes it a submit
[10:51:27] <KWhat_Work> ahhh thanks zim!
[10:52:05] <zim> KWhat_Work: That ate 3 hours of my life yesterday :-)
[10:52:09] <KWhat_Work> wow, that would have seriously taken me all day
[10:53:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, it was added only in 1.9 )
[10:53:35] <zim> Glad to repay the favour I think it was coldhead who pointed it out to me in the end
[10:54:09] <djQuery> Mottie1, well that sucks, was trying to verify which of the versions that they are working on for a bug I was trying to fix
[10:54:57] <Mottie1> Phoenixz: Try this css: .ui-btn-icon-right .ui-icon { right: auto; left: 10px; } .ui-li-has-arrow .ui-btn-inner a.ui-link-inherit, .ui-li-static.ui-li-has-arrow { padding-right: 0; padding-left: 40px; }
[10:56:14] <zim> Phoenixz: Have you played with bootstrap? if not I can't recommend it highly enough .
[10:57:06] <Mottie1> zim: he's working on mobile
[10:57:14] <Mottie1> not sure if that matters
[10:57:43] <zim> Mottie1: That why I said what I did Bootstrap make it all very easy
[10:58:25] <zim> Mottie1: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html
[10:59:30] <zim> Mottie1: that and less are my new best friends
[10:59:34] <Mottie1> zim: I personally wouldn't pay $99 for an editor... I did a quick search and found this award winning one: http://bluegriffon.org/  I'm guessing you already know about ckeditor and tinymce
[11:00:24] <zim> Mottie1: TY yes I do but looking for something light simple and sleek.
[11:00:48] <Mottie1> lol wow it has an epub editor too
[11:01:00] <Mottie1> http://www.bluegriffon-epubedition.com/BGEE.html
[11:01:40] <Mottie1> hmm, I don't think it runs in the browser
[11:02:13] <zim> Nope just saw that its an application
[11:03:04] <Mottie1> what about Aloha editor?
[11:03:17] <Mottie1> http://aloha-editor.org/
[11:03:53] <Phoenixz> With the jquery mobile listview, is there a way to have the icons on the left side instead of the right? With buttons I can do this using data-iconpos="left", but so far this has not worked on listview items.. anybody
[11:04:32] <Mottie1> scroll up Phoenixz
[11:05:05] <Mottie1> oops, looks like you logged after I posted
[11:05:06] <Mottie1> Phoenixz: Try this css: .ui-btn-icon-right .ui-icon { right: auto; left: 10px; } .ui-li-has-arrow .ui-btn-inner a.ui-link-inherit, .ui-li-static.ui-li-has-arrow { padding-right: 0; padding-left: 40px; }
[11:10:35] <hashpuppy> open up firebug.  use the input on the right to fire the datepicker and select 1/31.  then use the left side to do the same.  the datepicker on the left should highlight the selected day on the left, but doesn't.  if you look at the logs it seems to skip over 1/31 and keeps trying to compare against march 03 2013.  what is going on?  http://jsfiddle.net/6Mstd/
[11:12:55] <Phoenixz> Mottie1: Thanks, sorry, didnt see it before, my IRC is disconnecting all the time, crap internet here.. thanks a lot, will try!
[11:15:56] <bradmaxs> I have a div that after an ajax success, I append some html.  I want to extend that to three other divs with a dynamic id. So how to detect the id of the clicked div with a class of .destination and an id of destination_num where num is created dynamically?  Currently the beginning of the function is $('.destination_'+i).on('submit', '#addDestination', function (event) {
[11:19:47] <djQuery> I am working on a plugin that inherits from the ui.dailog
[11:20:14] <djQuery> how can I get my _init to fire AFTER the default init?
[11:21:37] <ShawnRisk> If I have <button id="clockinout1" class="button-primary"><?php if ($savedstatus != ''){ echo $savedstatus; } else { echo 'Clock In'; } ?></button> and current: $('#clockinout1').val() == 'Clock In' ? 'clock-in' : 'clock-out' when the click event is activated. Â How come current comes out as clock-out all the time?
[11:23:02] <djQuery> ShawnRisk, huh
[11:23:40] <ShawnRisk> djQuery: go on
[11:23:49] <djQuery> looks like server side code not javascript\jquery
[11:24:00] <jrdn> when doing an ajax request, is the browser stats still available via server side (aka the HTTP_USER_AGENT)?
[11:24:09] <jrdn> if so, is it on all browsers?
[11:24:25] <jrdn> trying to see if I should send over that data via javascript or just rely on the server side to do it
[11:24:31] <ShawnRisk> djQuery: this is jQuery: current: $('#clockinout1').val() == 'Clock In' ? 'clock-in' : 'clock-out'
[11:24:52] <saliak> Anyone successfully implemented a file upload field with the jTable jQuery plugin?  I'm having trouble getting the upload to work.  Uploading to php and the $_FILES array is empy.  i'm pretty sure the form enctype is multipart/form-data  not sure what else could be going on
[11:25:17] <JeremyNull> the secure CDN (https / ssl) for the latest minified build (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js) of jQuery is returning a 504 gateway timeout and a resultant certificate error
[11:25:57] <JeremyNull> so any pages that use it receive a mixed content warning
[11:26:12] <JeremyNull> I put in a bug about it on the bug page
[11:26:13] <Caelum> does selenium work with all browsers? or just ff?
[11:26:16] <djQuery> JeremyNull, think I saw them mentioning they were having issues. thats one reason that I use the google cdn instead. that and more people use it so its most likely allready cached
[11:26:33] <djQuery> ?demo@shawnrisk
[11:26:33] <bot-t> shawnrisk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:26:47] <ShawnRisk> okay
[11:27:29] <ShawnRisk> :D
[11:27:37] <JeremyNull> ya, I WOULD use the google one... BUT google doesn't have a "latest minified" link.  SOOOooo, every time a newer version comes out, I have to dig out my code and update the links to their CDN
[11:27:48] <djQuery> ShawnRisk, but just from looking at it you can't just throw javascript in the middle of you html
[11:28:06] <JeremyNull> with jQuery's own hosted one, i can just point it to //code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js and I'll know I'm always using the newest version
[11:28:09] <mouses> i have parallels running windows 8 and IE 10.. is it worth testing IE9 and 8 nowadays? do people still use that shit? i use chrome and FF on my mac and i forgot about the windows world
[11:28:44] <mouses> its just a personal website for an artist
[11:29:01] <tfitts> mouses: no, I wouldn't worry about the windows world.  Such a small piece of the pie to be concerned with.
[11:29:02] <ShawnRisk> djQuery: this is not, this is on a js page
[11:29:10] <mouses> lol
[11:29:24] <mouses> dude doesnt windows automaticallly upgrade your IE nowadays?
[11:29:49] <JeremyNull> mouses, not necessarily
[11:29:50] <stewbydoo> anybody here familiar with raphael at all?
[11:30:03] <stewbydoo> raphael js that is
[11:30:14] <BillCriswell> Only know the turtle.
[11:30:20] <Caelum> mouses: check out browsershots and spoon.net
[11:30:23] <stewbydoo> wordd lol
[11:30:30] <Caelum> mouses: I use spoon.net to test in IE8
[11:30:33] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: What are you trying to do with it?
[11:30:39] <stewbydoo> http://jsfiddle.net/QQKfu/16/
[11:30:39] <JeremyNull> I use IETester
[11:30:43] <stewbydoo> get this to work
[11:30:47] <mouses> people are seriously using IE8?
[11:30:50] <stewbydoo> that i should say
[11:30:51] <mouses> wtf
[11:31:06] <mouses> i can only comprehend that if it's a public computer lab
[11:31:19] <Caelum> mouses: it depends, is your site for mass-consumption? then you only need to worry about IE9, will corporate users use it? then they might have old browsers
[11:31:31] <stewbydoo> IE sucks
[11:31:33] <stewbydoo> period
[11:31:35] <mouses> only fans of the artist will check it
[11:31:50] <BillCriswell> Define "work".
[11:32:10] <stewbydoo> I am trying to type text in the box hit submit then drag the text around
[11:32:14] <Caelum> mouses: I actually have lots of users on IE8, so that's why I test in it
[11:32:28] <Caelum> mouses: and it's a huge pain in the ass
[11:32:53] <tfitts> as a developer IE sucks, as a browser, it mostly gets the job done, and when you're missing out on something you generally don't know.
[11:33:22] <Caelum> <3 spoon.net
[11:33:25] <shoky> telnet gets the job done too
[11:33:30] <BillCriswell> tfitts: I had a client recently switch to Chrome and he thanks me for all the little improvements I did to it.
[11:33:43] <stewbydoo> BillCriswell, I am not sure why that doesn't work. Seems pretty straightforward
[11:33:50] <joshsmith> how would I select all classes like .graph-n, where n is an integer
[11:33:55] <Caelum> yeah that's the beauty of chrome, you can install it on an ancient XP machine and you have a modern browser
[11:33:58] <joshsmith> I thought it would be $('.graph-*')
[11:34:02] <joshsmith> but apparently it isn't
[11:34:37] <Caelum> joshsmith: you don't name classes like that?
[11:34:40] <tfitts> BillCriswell: switch from IE?
[11:34:51] <Caelum> joshsmith: you name them 'graph' and put the number in some other attribute
[11:35:37] <Caelum> joshsmith: but you can do what you are asking: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[11:35:57] <BillCriswell> tfitts: Yes.
[11:36:01] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Hmmm...
[11:36:54] <djQuery> JeremyNull, yes google does have a latests min'd one //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[11:37:16] <JeremyNull> ooooo, la, la
[11:37:25] <Caelum> I had issues with the new .min in IE due to multi-loading, so I switched to the regular .js
[11:37:25] <JeremyNull> make babies with me NOWZ!!!!
[11:37:29] <BillCriswell> I just tried logging textSet and it has no length, so that foreach isn't doing anything.
[11:37:41] <Caelum> I'm slowly fixing the multi-loading issues in our templates
[11:37:56] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:38:22] <shoky> JeremyNull it's best not to use such urls
[11:38:29] <djQuery> JeremyNull, I would expect the google one to be updated within a day or 2 of a version release of jquery
[11:38:54] <Caelum> shoky: check this out:
[11:38:59] <JeremyNull> that is FINE BY ME!
[11:39:05] <shoky> JeremyNull: jquery can get updated and make a breaking change that will break some plugin you're using and it'll take you weeks to figure out what's happened
[11:39:14] <Caelum> shoky: http://gist.github.com/4626873
[11:39:17] <JeremyNull> you're beatuiful djQuery... simply beautiful
[11:39:19] <JeremyNull> thank you
[11:39:43] <shoky> Caelum: wha?
[11:39:45] <JeremyNull> I'm actually ok with that, cause it will force me to stay on top of things ;-)
[11:40:04] <Es0teric> has anyone used the twitter bootstrap modal here?
[11:40:15] <Es0teric> i am wondering if it supports callbacks
[11:40:21] <Caelum> shoky: that's the thingy I'm using to load jquery
[11:40:26] <JeremyNull> if it breaks, then I should have been keeping it updated ;-)  I don't like my code to just sit there untouched/unfixed/unupdated
[11:40:37] <shoky> Caelum: okz
[11:40:44] <JeremyNull> I like the force or reminders that I screwed shit up ;-)
[11:41:09] <Es0teric> like... $('#myModal').modal({param1 : 'val', remote : '/url'}, function() { //callback });
[11:41:18] <JeremyNull> thank you again bro, you're top notch
[11:41:26] <aram535> Is there a chan for jquery modules like jqgrid, or can I ask a question here?
[11:41:29] <lonejack> hi folk. I'm here for problem on setup modal dialog. I want to set buttons with primary and secondary icon. I don't know how to obtain this(ok, the buttons appears but not the icon)
[11:41:48] <mrryanjohnston> Hey guys. I'm using the sortreceive event on sortreceive event (http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive). I have a sortable list within another sortable list. The receive event fires for the outtermost UL when an li is added to the inner ul. Is this normal behavior? If so, can I get around it somehow by explicitely say only fire when the outermost ul has an li added to it
[11:42:12] <Caelum> lonejack: does the api support icons? if not you can use css
[11:43:34] <djQuery> mrryanjohnston, had lots of issues when trying to do that before
[11:43:44] <djQuery> mrryanjohnston, ie sucks
[11:44:02] <mrryanjohnston> djQuery: bah. luckily this is an internal thing, so ie isn't a problem
[11:44:42] <djQuery> mrryanjohnston, lucky you, this was for a product that ONLY worked in IE
[11:44:50] <mrryanjohnston> djQuery: woof.
[11:45:02] <Caelum> mrryanjohnston: at worst you can check the target of the event object
[11:45:11] <djQuery> mrryanjohnston, so much spagheti,
[11:45:39] <djQuery> mrryanjohnston, before beating you head go review the open bugs and see if any of them look like yours
[11:45:56] <mrryanjohnston> djQuery: roger that
[11:46:08] <mrryanjohnston> Caelum: yeah, that was my next step. I just had to ask :)
[11:46:35] <bradmaxs> Trying to get an elements id when a form is submitted. http://jsfiddle.net/8radV/
[11:47:56] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: $(this).attr('id').split('_')[0] I think is what you want.
[11:49:38] <BillCriswell> [1] I mean.
[11:49:45] <BillCriswell> You probably knew that, though.
[11:49:50] <bradmaxs> BillCriswell: thanks for responding.  I actually put the wrong code in the first function. Here is the new one. http://jsfiddle.net/8radV/3/
[11:50:17] <bradmaxs> BillCriswell: I want to find the id in the second function but the first one is as far as I have got to get it.
[11:50:26] <bradmaxs> trying to combine the 2
[11:51:17] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: http://jsfiddle.net/8radV/4/ like this?
[11:51:50] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: Blah, sorry, should just be this
[11:51:52] <BillCriswell> Force of habit.
[11:52:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/8radV/5/ woo
[11:53:31] <Caelum> shoky: I think I'm going to put that thingy on github and make it a bit more general
[11:54:05] <bradmaxs> BillCriswell: it works but I want to get the id of the .destination div rather than the form id.  I guess the way I have it set up with the .on function, it isn't getting the first element.
[11:55:08] <BillCriswell> bradoaks: Ohhhhh. .parent() would do it, like this. http://jsfiddle.net/8radV/6/
[11:55:27] <joshsmith> hm is it not possible to get the height of a <g> using query?
[11:55:30] <bradoaks> BillCriswell: not me
[11:55:45] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: ^
[11:55:48] <BillCriswell> bradoaks: Sorry dude.
[11:55:58] <Es0teric> does anybody know if bootstrap modal supports callbacks? like... $('#myModal').modal({param1 : 'val', remote : '/url'}, function() { //callback });
[11:56:48] <bradmaxs> BillCriswell: Awesome. .parent().  Never used it before.  That is going to take me far...TY
[11:57:43] <Caelum> does googleapis have jquery-ui too?
[11:57:51] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: Welcome! If you need to find a specific one faster there's .closest('.parentOrGrandParentOrMore');
[11:58:31] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Not sure... You can go through this and it might be able to help: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-modal.js
[11:58:49] <Es0teric> aright, thanks BillCriswell
[11:59:17] <Caelum> no doesn't seem to
[11:59:51] <Caelum> is there a plan for -ui 2.0 to be ES5 only as well?
[12:00:09] <djQuery> so if I am inheriting from another ui.widget and I need something special in the _init I just need to  call  this._super("_init")?
[12:01:39] <mouses> anybody runnign parallels?
[12:02:06] <shoky> Caelum then you better make it usable too.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/99MUW/
[12:03:03] <BillCriswell> Mmm, vanilla.
[12:04:12] <BillCriswell> shoky: Adding CSS <link>s to the body or should that be head?
[12:04:30] <shoky> BillCriswell: head i'd say. not my code ;p
[12:04:36] <BillCriswell> shoky: Oh, haha.
[12:05:00] <d4rklit3> ey
[12:05:13] <BillCriswell> bea
[12:05:25] <shoky> wou
[12:05:42] <d4rklit3> i have an a selector that selects a number of UL   i want to search that selector for the ul that has a particular data attribute
[12:05:48] <d4rklit3> how would i do this
[12:05:50] <d4rklit3> *hey**
[12:06:12] <BillCriswell> d4rklit3: ul[data-foo]
[12:06:25] <d4rklit3> right but ul is in a js var
[12:06:34] <d4rklit3> $lists = $("ul")
[12:06:37] <d4rklit3> so from $lists
[12:06:47] <BillCriswell> $lists.filter('[data-foo]')
[12:06:47] <shoky> .filter or .find
[12:07:34] <d4rklit3> filter is what i was looking for
[12:07:37] <d4rklit3> thanks
[12:07:43] <d4rklit3> shoky find only looks in the children
[12:07:56] <shoky> d4rklit3: right, i wasn't sure which you meant
[12:08:27] <bradmaxs> BillCriswell: Hey Bill.  Thanks again.  I got caught on the phone and wasn't able to respond.  Been at this for a little while.  You saved me some time and I learned something. TY again.
[12:08:43] <BillCriswell> You did say you wanted to "search" that selector, which .find() does.
[12:09:02] <BillCriswell> bradmaxs: No problem at all.
[12:20:11] <MissGeek> hi guys, is this the best way to do this? $('.post').children('p:last').addClass('last'); - I've tried $('.post > p:last-child') .. but that doesn't work?
[12:20:16] <Ziber> using $(".inputs").blur(), can I somehow figure out the ID of the element clicked?
[12:20:27] <Ziber> s/clicked/blurred
[12:25:11] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: Try p:last-of-type
[12:25:27] <Ziber> So, I can use this.id, can I $(this.id).html()?
[12:25:55] <BillCriswell> Ziber: Yeah, but you'd have to do $('#' . this.id)
[12:27:13] <MissGeek> BillCriswell: Thanks, that works better.. but still isn't picking up all of them strangly..
[12:27:14] <MissGeek> .
[12:27:18] <MissGeek> strangely*
[12:27:44] <akkufomk> has anyone had problems getting your accordion widgets to autosize to the parent div when the accordion contains a JSTree control?
[12:27:47] <Ziber> BillCriswell: right, thanks
[12:27:51] <Mottie1> MissGeek: Are you targeting p's inside of one post or all posts?
[12:28:07] <djQuery> MissGeek,  well '#something' will only ever pick up 1, do you have more than 1 item with the same id on the page?
[12:28:20] <djQuery> MissGeek, having more than 1 is not valid html
[12:28:45] <Ziber> BillCriswell: What about $("#" + this.id).val()
[12:28:46] <Ziber> ?
[12:28:47] <MissGeek> I want to pick up the last paragraph in each .post
[12:29:07] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: http://jsbin.com/urutil/1/edit
[12:29:22] <djQuery> MissGeek, ignore me got issues mixed up
[12:30:56] <vikorasmussen> Hi, I'm new to jquery, but i just wrote a function to populate a form with vales from a JSON string, would anyone give it a quick look and tell me if I'm doing something terribly wrong here?: http://pastebin.com/zAhX8AeJ
[12:31:19] <foo> e && id != 'SaveAndContinue' && e.preventDefault(); - this should run e.preventDefault() only if e exists and id doesn't equal SaveAndContinue - right?
[12:31:28] <foo> (doesn't seem to be, not sure if something else is broke or if I'm wrong on that)
[12:31:46] <MissGeek> BillCriswell: Thanks, hmm.. there must be something wrong with my HTML..
[12:33:47] <MissGeek> hunting down some unclosed tagâ€¦ *sigh*
[12:35:14] <Wanfu> Is there a jquery event to detect when text has 'overflow'ed out of an element?
[12:36:37] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: Keep in mind if it's a nested p it's not techincally the last.
[12:36:47] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: http://jsbin.com/urutil/4/edit for example.
[12:37:35] <MissGeek> BillCriswell: yeah I have some in blockquotes which I didn't want to trigger
[12:37:48] <HankHendrix> How can I pause a timed slideshow on mouseenter and resume on mouseleave with the correct remainder of time left? To my understanding you can't pause a setInterval?
[12:37:48] <M4d3L> any idea how to fix backhole issue when loading form by ajax?
[12:38:04] <M4d3L> wrong chan sorry
[12:39:02] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: Eak. Well good luck.
[12:39:38] <Caelum> shoky: yeah thanks for testing, it seemed to work in my page last night, now trying to figure out why it doesn't actually work :/
[12:39:54] <shoky> Caelum: because the script loading is not synchronous
[12:40:07] <BillCriswell> MissGeek: HTML Validator can find it pretty quick I bet.
[12:41:23] <Caelum> shoky: if I use defer='defer' in IE it works, but defer doesn't help in webkit
[12:41:59] <shoky> Caelum: there are already good & tested libraries that do this stuff
[12:42:06] <Caelum> shoky: like?
[12:42:16] <shoky> Caelum:  requirejs
[12:42:31] <Caelum> shoky: also, if script loading is not synchronous how does jquery work?
[12:42:34] <HankHendrix> How can I pause a timed slideshow on mouseenter and resume on mouseleave with the correct remainder of time left? To my understanding you can't pause a setInterval?
[12:43:13] <shoky> Caelum: like anything asynchronous, with callbacks/events
[12:43:32] <shoky> Caelum: e.g. a 'load' event on the script element
[12:44:04] <shoky> and set script's async property to true, i guess
[12:44:24] <Caelum> shoky: I mean, how is $ available
[12:45:37] <HankHendrix> How can I pause a timed slideshow on mouseenter and resume on mouseleave with the correct remainder of time left? To my understanding you can't pause a setInterval?
[12:46:03] <shoky> Caelum: because regular script loading is synchronous by defulat
[12:46:05] <shoky> default
[12:46:18] <shoky> Caelum: regular meaning not triggered by javascript
[12:47:13] <shoky> Caelum: and for scripts inserted by js, the default is browser-dependent
[12:47:24] <Caelum> shoky: awesome
[12:47:42] <Caelum> shoky: I'll look at requirejs, thanks
[12:47:52] <shoky> ;p
[12:48:59] <greg606> hi
[12:49:24] <voidpirate> hi
[12:49:28] <greg606> any idea why $('#oneoneSeries').attr('checked', true); may not work? please not the obvious ones I checked
[12:49:53] <HankHendrix> @greg606: Have you included JQuery?
[12:50:05] <jgv> lol
[12:50:09] <greg606> HankHendrix: please...
[12:50:37] <voidpirate> lol
[12:50:57] <shoky> greg606:  use .prop
[12:51:10] <Caelum> greg606: it may not work if you use onclick or onchange instead of .click() or .change()
[12:51:16] <Caelum> greg606: I had that experience
[12:51:29] <greg606> i have .change(
[12:51:34] <shoky> greg606:  use .prop
[12:51:55] <greg606> i'll try but it worked in previous html
[12:51:57] <Mottie1> and use keyUp instead of change
[12:52:05] <shoky> greg606: you mean it worked in previous jquery version, maybe
[12:52:11] <zoned> anyone used jquery isotope? i'm trying to use this plugin to display a responsive image gallery, but the problem i'm finding is that when i browser scale a bunch of images, and then run isotope.filter, the transitions get really glitchy because of this dual-scaling. anyone have any ideas?
[12:52:13] <greg606> possible
[12:52:42] <Caelum> keyup is for keyboard events
[12:53:19] <Mottie1> errr I meant mouseup
[12:53:26] <greg606> yes, previous version
[12:53:36] <greg606> damn
[12:54:40] <greg606> THANKS
[12:54:44] <greg606> THANKS
[12:54:47] <greg606> :D
[12:54:49] <shoky> xD
[12:54:50] <greg606> prop
[12:55:28] <TelFiRE> Anyone use FooTable? I have applied it to a table that is inside a div that is hidden, and when I slidetoggle it open FooTable is active but it is in "mobile mode" regardless of what it should be. When I resize the browser it updates and is correct from there on, but it is wrong on initial load. Any clues?
[12:58:17] <Caelum> shoky: requireJS seems more complicated than what I'm trying to do
[12:58:29] <nickswe> Hi, can anyone please tell me if this is the correct approach to see what elements that has been added to/or removed from an array... Is it bullet proof? (code is about 6 lines): http://jsfiddle.net/beRwb/    Thanks in advance!
[12:58:40] <Caelum> shoky: the first thing I tried was to just document.write() a script tag, which worked everywhere except IE8
[13:00:33] <chronos> hello. people, why this returns []: $("<span class='foo'>aa</span><span class='bar'>bar</span>").find('.bar')
[13:00:45] <chronos> should not return span class='bar'?
[13:01:30] <systemfault> Nope
[13:01:58] <systemfault> Because .find doesn't finds at the "current level", only deeper in the tree
[13:02:12] <systemfault> If you want to do that, you need .siblings
[13:03:21] <Mottie1> nickswe: That looks like it works, but it's probably not the best (fastest) way to do it... check out this stackoverflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4026828/145346
[13:03:22] <chronos> ah :), so find = level +1, siblings = level +0
[13:03:24] <Drager> Can u get datetime easly in jquery? Like 2013-01-24 22:03:21
[13:03:35] <chronos> thx systemfault
[13:03:58] <systemfault> Drager: No, jquery doesn't abstracts Date
[13:04:13] <systemfault> Drager: See if what javascript provides is enough
[13:04:27] <systemfault> ?js var x = new Date(); x;
[13:04:32] <bot-t> systemfault: <2013-01-24T21:04:15.554Z>
[13:04:34] <nickswe> Mottie1: thanks for the feedback!
[13:04:36] <Drager> systemfault: Yeah in js i could do: date.getFullYear() + "-" + date.getMonth() + "-" + date.getDate() + " " +  date.getHours() + ":" + date.getMinutes() + ":" + date.getSeconds();
[13:04:52] <Caelum> chronos: you want .filter
[13:05:22] <Mottie1> Drager: none of that is jQuery
[13:05:44] <Caelum> chronos: .find works on the dom, .filter works on a set of elements
[13:06:07] <chronos> what exactly is difference between filter an siblings?
[13:06:48] <chronos> oh understand doc now
[13:06:48] <chronos> nvm
[13:06:52] <chronos> thx Caelum
[13:06:53] <chronos> an systemfault
[13:07:34] <systemfault> siblings works in that case because the nodes you need to filter are all at the same "level" in the tree
[13:07:43] <Wanfu> Is there a jquery event to detect when text has 'overflow'ed out of an element?
[13:08:16] <chronos> systemfault: yes, but this html can be anything with .foo and .bar in my real case, so I guess filter is best, right?
[13:08:33] <systemfault> Both will work :)
[13:08:41] <Mottie1> Drager: btw, that stackoverflow function won't work in IE8 and older
[13:09:08] <Mottie1> unless you add a custom array.indexOf function or use jQuery $.inArray()
[13:15:47] <anonychus> hi
[13:17:51] <airic82> Hey, everyone! Could someone tell me an easy way to use jQuery/JavaScript to tell if a textbox is valid in HTML? It has to be possible if I can use the :valid selector in CSS.
[13:19:10] <tomasm-> hi, does load() get triggered on an image if it's set to display: none ? I am resizing a picture once it's loaded; is there a way to not show it until after the resize? It always shows as a giant picture for a split second. or maybe load() fires if visible: hidden ?
[13:19:28] <airic82> Sorry... I meant to say HTML5 in there.
[13:20:51] <d4rklit3> in jqui sortable when i run the stop event, what exactly is the sortable object im getting?
[13:21:31] <solepixe|> I'm trying to toggle a specific selection of elements. I want to hide elements based on a selection, then show those exact same elements. I tried to use this http://pastebin.com/jNebCQkW but the rows don't "show" because it seems to re-check which ones are visible.
[13:22:14] <d4rklit3> nvm i got it
[13:22:31] <airic82> Is no one here that might know the answer to my question?
[13:22:34] <solepixe|> how can i store those specific elements, so i can manipulate the exact same table rows later?
[13:23:24] <slick-> every time i have a query ui dialog open up
[13:23:28] <slick-> it scrolls down on the page
[13:23:30] <slick-> i don't want it to do that
[13:23:33] <slick-> how do i prevent it
[13:27:28] <Gorroth> hi
[13:28:00] <Gorroth> is there an .attr()-like method where i can pass in a dictionary to setup a whole bunch of attributes without having to write a method to do this?
[13:28:40] <Gorroth> i wanna use it like this $("#selector").attr({placeholder:"...", pattern:"...", ...});
[13:29:21] <tintin> How can i select input type="textbox" ?
[13:29:39] <tintin> $("input[type='textbox']).focus(.. ?
[13:29:46] <airic82> tintin: $("input[type='textbox']")
[13:29:55] <Gorroth> oooh, i found it
[13:30:04] <Gorroth> i missed it in the docs at first
[13:30:32] <otherj> hey guys, how do i put the file from a drag event into a file input?
[13:30:44] <otherj> right now i'm doing this: https://gist.github.com/43a72635c8286d5d4fc2
[13:30:55] <cwatson> Hello all, I'm using media elements to play audio on any browser but I want to stop it with link commands. Can anyone help me out? - http://jsbin.com/anerav/2/edit
[13:31:55] <Drager> So I upload a file, on win(r) I send to another page and on that page I want to type out the response, can I do that in some way?
[13:32:44] <devslash> im using firebug lite in IE to test if an element exists. this test works correctly in all browsers except I.E 8. if ( $('#AddRowsTop') !== null ) { .. do someting .. } in firebug if I do $('#AddRowsTop')  it returns [] but alert($('#AddRowsTop')) shows [object Object]
[13:33:02] <otherj> sometimes i forget how useless irc is
[13:34:25] <devslash> does anyone know why this is ?
[13:35:19] <devslash> in fact, doing alert($('#anyelementname)) shows [object Object]
[13:35:22] <slick-> can anyone tell me how to prevent jquery ui dialog from autoscrolling when it brings up the window
[13:36:41] <tintin> It does not work, why? $("input[type='textbox']").focus(function(){
[13:36:56] <djQuery> with ui button if you set text: false, label: 'close me' you dont get a tooltip?
[13:37:40] <devslash> is jquery borked with IE8 ?
[13:38:10] <djQuery> devslash, you got that backwords
[13:38:22] <devslash> ok you know what i mean
[13:38:42] <djQuery> devslash, what version jquery they have dropped support for multiple versions of ie
[13:38:49] <devslash> 1.8
[13:38:51] <djQuery> think 9 and 10 all that supported now
[13:38:58] <[jmc]> devslash, Object.prototype.toString.call($('#AddRowsTop'));
[13:38:58] <anonychus> please, can anybody tell me which is the best storage system por jquery mobile? i like to do one retail aplicacion for example
[13:39:28] <chronos> there is some event triggered when I click out of a input for example, some event that I can attach?
[13:39:37] <devslash> [jmc] thats not correct either
[13:39:39] <djQuery> anonychus, dont ever ask a Q like that unless you want to start a fight
[13:39:46] <chronos> I'm making a inplace edit so I wanna hide input when click out of it
[13:40:15] <djQuery> anonychus, and it depends on how much data you plan on storing
[13:40:27] <devslash> [jmc] that returns [object Object] even if i change the lement to a made up name that doesnt exist
[13:40:43] <djQuery> anonychus, and its not jquery mobile specific at all
[13:40:49] <anonychus> ok
[13:41:16] <chronos> nvm, focusout :)
[13:41:41] <anonychus> web sql storage have more storing?
[13:41:54] <djQuery> anonychus, believe so
[13:43:22] <anonychus> ok, do you know how much?
[13:43:57] <anonychus> i only know that web storage have 5 megabytes
[13:45:00] <djQuery> anonychus, the standard doesnt actualy dicatate a size limit that is done by each browser
[13:45:19] <anonychus> ok thanks
[13:45:47] <djQuery> anonychus, so think 5 mb but your milage may vary
[13:47:15] <anonychus> djQuery: i would for example expanding the size to 20 mg as google chrome'
[13:47:17] <anonychus> ?
[13:48:28] <djQuery> anonychus, message me lets not keep clogging channel with this off topic    topic
[13:48:49] <djQuery> anonychus, or join the #html5 channel
[13:48:51] <tintin> If a textbox is focused then blur it, when other textbox is focused, previous one .addClass() will be deleted and the current one will be selected
[13:48:55] <tintin> How can i do it?
[13:48:59] <tintin> Can anyone answer?
[13:49:05] <devslash> im using IE with jQuery 1.9 compressed and Im testing whether an element exists using Firebug lite. $('#AddRowsTop') returns [a#AddRowsTop.OpsBar] and$('#AddRowsTop') == null returns false but $('#AddRowsTopDoesntexist') returns [] and $('#AddRowsTopDoesntexist') == null returns false as well...
[13:49:08] <anonychus> ok thanks
[13:50:20] <djQuery> tintin, so are you saying when 1 is focused you want to remove the class from any other input that currently has the class then add it to the one that currently has focus?
[13:50:43] <djQuery> tintin, you could remove the class on blur   and add the class on focus
[13:51:35] <tintin> Can you paste example ?
[13:51:56] <djQuery> $('form').on('blur', 'input', function(){   $(this).removeClass('focused');})
[13:54:28] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72578/
[13:54:36] <tintin> djQuery: Is that correct? ^
[13:59:45] <tintin> Can anyone answer?
[14:00:00] <tintin> What's wrong with this? $("input:text").blur(function(){
[14:00:01] <tintin> 					$(this).removeClass('textshadow');
[14:00:01] <tintin> 				}
[14:02:09] <Caelum> googleapis doesn't set Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the .js files, so can't load them via ajax :(
[14:03:47] <Caelum> tintin: maybe "input[type=text]" ?
[14:04:29] <tintin> ok
[14:04:40] <tintin> http://twitter.com/
[14:04:56] <tintin> if you click any textbox, it has blue color outside,
[14:05:03] <tintin> is it border or box-shadow?
[14:06:07] <Caelum> I'm guessing they use twitter bootstrap
[14:06:22] <Caelum> because that's how bootstrap form elements look
[14:09:43] <xpe> Is there a way to asynchronously load an image and at the same time be able to handle response where the server sends an xml (exception) file insteadt of the image? I currently just set the src attribute of an img tag and call load(), but I am not able to handle a returning xml file this way.
[14:11:23] <tintin> Caelum: What do you mean by bootstrap?
[14:12:53] <Caelum> tintin: twitter bootstrap is a css/js framework
[14:13:07] <Caelum> xpe: maybe something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/164181/how-to-fetch-a-remote-image-to-display-in-a-canvas
[14:16:00] <xpe> Thank you Caelum, but i guess to use that Image object will result in the same problems. I would be able to get the content of a file which is sent by the server instead of the expected image.
[14:16:27] <Caelum> xpe: yeah I don't see how to get at the image data with an Image object
[14:16:29] <xpe> In my case I cannot tell the mime type of the response upfront :/
[14:17:04] <xpe> It's either text/xml or image/png
[14:20:15] <anonychus> which is the best book of jquery mobile?
[14:25:12] <Caelum> xpe: do you need the xml exception in your javascript, or only to know if it's a valid image?
[14:26:13] <xpe> No, I unfortunately also need the xml content
[14:28:14] <josefrichter> guys, any ideas how to improve this bit of code please? I feel the callbacks should be done differently, but not sure howâ€¦ http://pastie.org/5851332
[14:34:40] <shoky> josefrichter that's fine
[14:35:02] <steveoh> hi so ajax success formats the response based on dataType
[14:35:07] <steveoh> but error does not
[14:35:16] <dismist> hey why does chrome stall out until the javascript function is done when u run it asynchronously but firefox locks up the rest of the browser and shows whats rendering in the ajax func
[14:35:22] <steveoh> and complete does not either
[14:35:50] <steveoh> wht method would i use to have formatted data for all httpstatus codes
[14:36:09] <dismist> cant u do it with ajaxsetup
[14:37:07] <steveoh> i'm not sure
[14:37:45] <steveoh> im almost thinking to dig in the source to see how success does it and copy the code to fail or always/complete but that feels dirty
[14:37:53] <josefrichter> shaky but isn't it blocking the execution? shouldn't I at least put the shit into 'success' callback or something?
[14:38:08] <shoky> josefrichter: you did
[14:38:58] <shoky> ?getjson
[14:39:00] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:39:05] <shoky> ^ success
[14:40:18] <fission6> anyone have a rec around magnification on an image
[14:40:23] <fission6> like that hover zoom
[14:40:45] <josefrichter> shoky ah right, now I get it. thanks.
[14:41:09] <Mottie1> fission6: check out http://css-tricks.github.com/AnythingZoomer/image.html
[14:41:11] <Caelum> steveoh: is it json? you can just do: var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)
[14:41:23] <steveoh> it is json
[14:42:44] <fission6> thanks Mottie1
[14:48:25] <Mottie1> np!
[14:49:25] <fission6> Mottie1: i have what maybe a stupid question
[14:49:38] <fission6> do i need a version of my image that is actually larger? i just though css zoomed in on it
[14:49:45] <Mottie1> fission6: then I'm sure I have a stupid answer ;)
[14:50:34] <Mottie1> nope, you can have one large image, then shrink it down for the "small" block
[14:51:03] <Mottie1> that plugin will duplicate it for you, but make sure you set the css to resize the smaller one
[14:51:10] <fission6> hmmm
[14:51:19] <fission6> well my issue is i just have a small version
[14:51:30] <fission6> i don't know why buti thought it just used css zoom to zoom in on it
[14:51:37] <Mottie1> then the zoomed window will look blurry
[14:51:38] <fission6> (i don't have a larger version)
[14:51:44] <fission6> thats okay for now
[14:52:01] <Mottie1> you can just set the dimensions of the large image to be bigger
[14:54:12] <Mottie1> fission6: check out this demo... it's only using the small image http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/f6d49/17/
[14:54:18] <Drager> Mottie1: Alright, do you got any good way to accomplish it?
[14:54:20] <Drager> In jquery
[14:54:28] <Drager> That was my main question
[14:54:35] <Mottie1> Drager: accomplish what? o.O
[14:55:04] <jrockjiggz2> Mottie1: thats dope
[14:55:10] <Drager> Mottie1: Some way in jquery to get the datetime formatted as; 2013-01-24 23:55:07
[14:55:58] <Mottie1> Drager: jquery doesn't do anything with the date, but you can with basic javascript
[14:56:10] <Mottie1> Drager: what are you starting with? and what do you want to end up with?
[14:56:37] <Drager> Mottie1: I just do new Date()
[14:56:38] <Mottie1> Drager: and have you seen sugar.js? http://sugarjs.com/dates
[14:56:45] <jrockjiggz2> Drager: momentjs

[14:59:34] <fission6> Mottie1: i am getting a weird result
[14:59:42] <Mottie1> from?
[15:00:24] <fission6> http://i.imgur.com/dpJEBD0.png
[15:00:38] <fission6> i just used {clone:true} thats all i used for initializing
[15:00:52] <Mottie1> did you set the image dimensions in the css?
[15:01:08] <fission6> http://dpaste.org/9xBhf/
[15:01:25] <Mottie1> can you update that jsFiddle?
[15:01:28] <fission6> Mottie1: must i ? when i remark out small img in your fiddle's css its fine
[15:01:46] <Mottie1> up to you... I think it's a css problem though
[15:01:55] <fission6> js fiddle sucks ass in chrome now
[15:01:59] <fission6> as a side note
[15:02:04] <Mottie1> it's really slow, I know =(
[15:02:08] <Mottie1> brb
[15:05:21] <someprimetime> jsfiddle has always been slow
[15:05:25] <someprimetime> it's not a "chrome thing"
[15:05:29] <someprimetime> but it's still the best for demos im
[15:05:31] <someprimetime> s/im/imo
[15:05:54] <someprimetime> why they don't offer paid premium access i'm not sure
[15:06:46] <anonychus> please, can anybody give me one book of jquery mobile?
[15:06:47] <someprimetime> sugar.jsâ€¦ what an odd choice for a name
[15:08:26] <dragonshed> short for "syntax sugar" I'd guess
[15:11:17] <relipse> what is the best rich text editor (clean and tiny) that will give html output , similar to how gmail does it?
[15:11:44] <Mottie1> back
[15:11:51] <Mottie1> fission6: so it's working now?
[15:12:23] <fission6> nope
[15:12:30] <Mottie1> ugh brb again...
[15:12:36] <fission6> wait
[15:12:40] <fission6> ar you changing code?
[15:12:44] <fission6> what are you doing
[15:13:29] <Mottie1> LOL someone at the door trying to sell me something
[15:13:32] <fission6> also i think i know what the issue is
[15:14:56] <fission6> so the image i am using (and want to zoom on) the image is 700 Ã— 250 pixels, when i place it into the page and in a div with limited with it gets rendered as 570 x 204 px
[15:16:35] <Mottie1> the large image is limited?... it shouldn't matter because it is absolutely positioned
[15:16:49] <Mottie1> so it should take on the dimensions set in the css
[15:17:43] <fission6> its just "off"
[15:19:19] <fission6> i may ave to find another plugin
[15:19:24] <fission6> this aint cutting it
[15:24:46] <thujone> i've used jqzoom successfully
[15:24:48] <thujone> fission6
[15:25:04] <thujone> but it did have some bugs in it
[15:25:11] <thujone> it works fine if you just need something quick
[15:25:36] <thujone> if you're going to use it a lot you might need to debug a few things in the plugin
[15:27:19] <Mottie1> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/f6d49/18/
[15:27:47] <Mottie1> the large width and height need to be proportional to the small width and height
[15:28:18] <fission6> i just went with a another plugin which worked out of the box
[15:28:22] <fission6> thanks Mottie1

[16:11:22] <DJDan> someprimetime: well the drag and drop part anyway lol
[16:11:59] <someprimetime> not really.. you could use the jquery ui drag/drop and then load your xml in a callback

[16:55:36] <raj> Eviltwin, one last question I think
[16:55:42] <raj> ...ping :)
[16:56:05] <systemfault> coldhead: I mean, there's no a inside his #toggleFilters element
[16:56:22] <systemfault> Ahhh
[16:56:24] <systemfault> nevermind..
[16:56:32] <systemfault> His code is not inside a closure.
[16:56:37] <systemfault> shrug.
[16:56:56] <coldhead> interesting how it looks right though huh
[16:56:58] <coldhead> subtle
[16:57:55] <systemfault> And JS.. being itself, the this refers to windowâ€¦ so that's why the toggle worked.
[16:58:34] <scott[8]> is there anyway to do a .replaceWith, or .html, or .load, and allow for UTF-8 content? (with non-english characters)
[16:59:31] <systemfault> Should work as-is,no?
[16:59:40] <systemfault> If you have a meta charset
[16:59:57] <scott[8]> doesn't seem like - everything keeps coming back as ASCII-8BIT
[17:06:31] <Caelum> is there an inline doc format for js? like doxygen?

[18:03:07] <amh345> jquery-seethu?
[18:03:11] <dblosevn> other then the 3 examples they show that might be all it supports
[18:03:43] <amh345> yeah. i had a fun idea.  i wanted to load movies and only have them show through my text on my page.
[18:03:56] <amh345> but i dont want to convert them to xyz and all that crap.
[18:04:06] <dblosevn> no need
[18:04:08] <amh345> i could just make an image mask of the text instead. but that kills the fun
[18:04:28] <dblosevn> make the video wmode=opaque
[18:04:37] <dblosevn> set the z-index to 0
[18:05:03] <dblosevn> or html5 video?
[18:05:16] <amh345> this is just for me to play with. so it can be html5
[18:05:24] <dblosevn> if so only diference is you dont need wmode
[18:05:26] <amh345> i dont need it to work for everyone
[18:05:41] <amh345> i think i might be missing some of the concept here.
[18:05:55] <dblosevn> or use flowplayer
[18:06:03] <dblosevn> then you can really screw with wem

[18:07:46] <dblosevn> you didnt tell it to do anything just included the plugin on the page

[18:08:17] <Fenikkusu> dblosevn, Yes that's true. However my issue at the moment is irrelevant to it doing anything.
[18:08:45] <Fenikkusu> I'm trying to understand why it's indicating my prototype is not defined, despite everything else appearing correct.
[18:08:53] <dblosevn> oh.... my bad
[18:09:11] <dblosevn> thought you were the guy with the image tooltip thingy lol
[18:09:35] <dblosevn> i need sleep lmao
[18:09:40] <amh345> oh yeah. i guess i could use flowplayer and inject text into movie.    but still not really what i was hoping for.
[18:10:00] <amh345> i mean, i dont have any real purpose for this. hah.   just wanted to see if i could get movie to mask through html text
[18:10:26] <dblosevn> its like 5 lines of js to make flowplayer do it lol
[18:10:38] <dblosevn> you can literally pass the html in as a parameter
[18:10:51] <amh345> you're giving it a hard sell!  hah
[18:11:00] <amh345> ok, find. ill check it out.
[18:11:38] <dblosevn> Fenikkusu: can you give me an example I can actually test on? so i can walk through it
[18:11:58] <dblosevn> I have the plugin but no usage example
[18:12:13] <amh345> im unsure if flow player is going to do exactly what i want though.   i dont want the text ontop of the vid. i want the vid to only show inside the 'confines' of the actual letters
[18:12:20] <amh345> anywho. ill give it a peep
[18:12:46] <dblosevn> oh no ittl overlay the text over the video
[18:12:56] <amh345> bummer :/
[18:13:17] <amh345> i just found it too.  they're used for captioning and stuff
[18:13:23] <dblosevn> its pretty cool too you can include like opt in forms to continue watching etc
[18:14:17] <dblosevn> i can make flowplayer bend over backwards for me lol
[18:14:39] <dblosevn> well i wonder
[18:14:40] <amh345> can you make it do what im saying?
[18:14:43] <dblosevn> what if
[18:15:01] <Fenikkusu> dblosevn, I've added the additional code that it uses ATM. http://jsfiddle.net/Fenikkusu/vr35z/1/
[18:15:04] <dblosevn> you made an overlay over the player and made its background black
[18:15:05] <djQuery> dblosevn, want to see the good parts of the video fill out this form with the credit card info first sucka
[18:15:23] <dblosevn> and the text color transparent
[18:15:56] <dblosevn> then the video would shine through the letters
[18:16:12] <dblosevn> let me help out Fenikkusu then ill do it for you sounds fun
[18:18:16] <djQuery> grrrr there is no ui-icon that would simulate the full screen button
[18:19:31] <Fenikkusu> Hmm...even doing var o = {}; var p = Object.create(o); p.prototype.toString(); returns the same error...so I don't think it's anything to do with the plugin...missing somethign somewhere.
[18:19:39] <amh345> dblosevn: i just photoshopped an example http://i.imgur.com/48ard1o.jpg
[18:20:08] <dblosevn> ya thats what i thought you wanted
[18:20:16] <amh345> k cool
[18:20:32] <nitrix_> Hi, I have an html like with the attribute data-tags="aaa,bbb,ccc". I'd like to fetch them using jquery, split by the comma, and iterate through.
[18:20:51] <amh345> yeah dude, any advice you got, let me know.  this isnt 'omg i need this for a client now' kind of thing.   purely just for fun
[18:20:51] <dblosevn> Fenikkusu: var o = {}; is undefined; no clue why
[18:21:07] <dblosevn> ya sounds fun so ill do it for a beer lmao jk
[18:21:16] <nitrix_> I tried $.each($(this).attr('data-tags').split(','), function() {} });
[18:21:28] <amh345> if you're in Toronto, ill buy you a beer
[18:21:28] <nitrix_> Yet I get [object Object] instead of my text.
[18:21:31] <amh345> hah
[18:22:02] <djQuery> nitrix_, $(this).data('tags')
[18:22:03] <nitrix_> *html link
[18:22:36] <dblosevn> i think chrome is just screwing with me
[18:22:59] <dblosevn> i got syntax error for {a: 1, b:2}
[18:23:36] <djQuery> dblosevn, if you make the background black and the letters transparent wont the letters just show the black background not the video under neath?
[18:24:46] <dblosevn> hmm ill check it out
[18:24:54] <dblosevn> trying to figure out whats wrong with my debugger
[18:25:38] <dblosevn> grrrrrrrrrrr
[18:25:50] <dblosevn> chrome must have broken the debugger in one of the last updates
[18:26:25] <nitrix_> Okay, time to be more serious.
[18:26:35] <nitrix_> $ 20 to whoever spend time on my stupid problem.
[18:26:37] <dblosevn> var o = Object.create({}); returns undefined where as o=Object.create({}); return Object
[18:26:43] <Danny_B> hello, how can i remove all nested elements but keep the directly contained text? i tried $('#foo').remove('*').text() but it shows the text of nested elements too. <div id="foo">Lorem <b>ipsum</b> dolor <i>sit</i></div> -> should return "Lorem  dolor "
[18:26:58] <dblosevn> thats sounds like beer money to me lol
[18:27:15] <nitrix_> 30.
[18:33:47] <MikeyD> I'm having trouble figuring out how to get tooltips to show up using imagemapster.  this is the doc: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?docs.html#tooltip and here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n4Wqn/1/ - i started over so it is easier to work with and learn what im doing
[18:35:50] <Fenikkusu> I'm definatly missing something...From what I'm reading, o = {} does not have a prototype where as o = function() {} does, and Object.create has no effect on this...
[18:37:17] <amh345> dblosevn: is this what you were thinking with the transparent text? http://jsfiddle.net/yFYWg/
[18:37:42] <golo> Hi there
[18:37:59] <golo> I would love to get some feedback about a jQuery Mobile widget I have created
[18:38:39] <golo> I will appreciate ANY kind of feedback
[18:39:41] <coldhead> i don't like the font
[18:39:57] <djQuery> nitrix_, I just spent 4 seconds typing this message in regards to your stupid problem, please make payments to my paypal account
[18:42:32] <djQuery> golo, link?
[18:44:07] <djQuery> Danny_B,   $('#whatever').children().remove()
[18:46:17] <DJDan> http://jsfiddle.net/jY8Cb/2/  ... how do i get the questionnaire questions to be on one side and answers on the other? and also check that they match?
[18:48:14] <Danny_B> djQuery: thanks
[18:49:06] <golo> In my Github account: https://github.com/Golodhros/jqm-basic-carousel
[18:49:09] <golo> Many thanks!
[18:49:21] <nitrix_> djQuery: dblosevn took his time to PM me and walk me through. Next time, at least contact me and make sure you seem interested.
[18:49:37] <nitrix_> That's the very least you can do to earn easy money.
[18:50:07] <Danny_B> djQuery: and if i want to keep the original content and just need the direct inner text?
[18:51:28] <Wilfiah> Heys guys, I am having an odd problem where two JQuery-UI sortable lists connected with "connectWith" break and placeholders no longer show in the correct places: http://wilhall.com/tests/apptest.html
[18:51:41] <Danny_B> .clone() produces duplicate id
[18:53:30] <alyis> Is there a simple way to remove any table rows after Nth row
[18:53:52] <alyis> im populating a table with rows from pubnub and i want to only ever show 10 rows
[18:54:20] <amh345> pornhub?
[18:54:30] <alyis> pubnub
[18:54:58] <Danny_B> alyis: how about the approach keep/copy first n rows and delete the rest?
[18:55:32] <dblosevn> Danny_B: var new_row = $(row).clone(); $(new_row).attr('id', 'new_id');
[18:56:13] <DJDan> anyone?
[18:56:32] <Danny_B> dblosevn: i guess you mixed our two different questions ;-)
[18:56:42] <dblosevn> or short hand $(row).clone().attr('id', 'new_id') but id prefer myself to have the reference to the new row
[18:57:06] <dblosevn> of i should read
[18:57:07] <dblosevn> lol
[18:57:38] <Danny_B> dblosevn: however, this won't work in my case, since the nested elements can have ids as well, as well as there is no previously known number of neste elements
[18:57:58] <dblosevn> bad implementation
[18:58:05] <Danny_B> otoh, what is known is, that i actually need the first text until the first nested element
[18:58:08] <dblosevn> id give the row an id and walk from there
[18:58:36] <dblosevn> or maybe not even an id, a data attri with a product id or similar
[18:58:44] <Danny_B> dblosevn: table rows was alyis' question, not mine ;-)
[18:58:48] <alyis> yeah keeping only the first n tables would work.
[18:58:53] <alyis> tables rows*
[19:01:11] <amh345> dblosevn: none of this vid stuff is working. http://jsfiddle.net/yFYWg/1/
[19:01:41] <dblosevn> i bet i know a way lol
[19:01:43] <dblosevn> dirty though
[19:01:55] <gen0cide> I have some code which currently works: http://pastebin.com/N1icZjZL  But now Im trying to give it a json array server side with 'error' => true and 'message' => "Email error"
[19:02:24] <gen0cide> How do I receive that message using my code?
[19:02:25] <djQuery> Danny_B, put up an example
[19:04:13] <ctx_> Hi, Im trying to pass the input of form as the var search keyword to an API call, where
[19:04:13] <ctx_> keyword=searchkeyword .. the variable isn't being set, what am i doing wrong: e.g.:
[19:04:13] <ctx_>  var searchkeyword = $("#searchterm").val(); ....
[19:04:13] <ctx_> $.getJSON("http://dev.domain.com/proxy.php?url=http://www.domain.com/search.json?keyword
[19:04:13] <ctx_> =searchkeyword&callback=?", ..
[19:05:30] <amh345> dblosevn: does it involve rendering an image from the div and using that as a mask? hah
[19:05:32] <ctx_> the proxy is to convert json to jsonp,
[19:05:45] <ctx_> (not issue)
[19:05:54] <dblosevn> amh345: and how did you guess
[19:06:05] <amh345> hah
[19:06:10] <MikeyD> djQuery: would you be willing to help me at all?
[19:07:37] <amh345> for the dblosevn, it probably make more sense just to create the inverted image in PS or something
[19:07:50] <amh345> opps, mouse jumped*
[19:08:49] <djQuery> DJDan, did you see this example? http://jqueryui.com/droppable/#photo-manager
[19:09:35] <djQuery> MikeyD, sorry been in and out kinda working on my own thing, whatching vids and yelling at kids at same time
[19:10:19] <MikeyD> djQuery: no prob. I'm having trouble figuring out how to get tooltips to show up using imagemapster. Â this is the doc: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?docs.html#tooltipÂ and here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n4Wqn/1/Â 
[19:12:07] <gen0cide> How do I reveive an json array using the ajax method?
[19:12:09] <Danny_B> djQuery: <div id="foo">See also: <a>lorem</a>, <a>ipsum</a>, <a>dolor</a>.</div> -> i need just the "See also: " as the result. nested <a>'s can have id's. previously unknown number of nested <a>'s
[19:12:16] <Wilfiah> Heys guys, I am having an odd problem where two JQuery-UI sortable lists connected with "connectWith" break and placeholders no longer show in the correct places: http://wilhall.com/tests/apptest.html
[19:12:50] <djQuery> Danny_B, do you know all the different tags that you would want to get rid of ?
[19:13:34] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot api ajax @ gen0cide
[19:13:34] <b-ot> gen0cide, no matches.
[19:15:15] <gen0cide> LocalPCGuy: Im trying to recieve the json array using my old code here: http://pastebin.com/N1icZjZL
[19:16:26] <djQuery> Danny_B, http://jsbin.com/epelet/2/edit
[19:17:13] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide derResponse should contain the data returned from the server.  If you control the server, you should be able to determine exactly what it returns.  If you don't control the server, do a console.log(derResponse) to see what it contains so you can access it
[19:17:25] <Danny_B> djQuery: nope. it can change. that .children().remove() would work - i can trim the text as i need, but it doesn't keep the content on page.
[19:17:43] <gen0cide> LocalPCGUY: I control it, ok Ill try that
[19:18:10] <djQuery> Danny_B, http://jsbin.com/epelet/3/edit
[19:18:16] <ctx_> ?
[19:18:53] <djQuery> Danny_B, did you want to keep the content on the page?
[19:20:05] <Danny_B> djQuery: yup. i actually mentioned that somewhere above, but it obviously got lost in the other noise...
[19:20:23] <djQuery> Danny_B, so does that work for you?
[19:20:40] <Danny_B> mmt, i tried 2 yet
[19:21:02] <djQuery> Danny_B, dont know if you posted one earlier or not but you get better responses when you have an example to post
[19:22:06] <djQuery> MikeyD, you still there?
[19:22:14] <gen0cide> LocalPCGUY: I don't seem to get a response
[19:22:14] <djQuery> looks like an intresting plug in
[19:22:37] <djQuery> looking at your areas none of them have a tooltip property
[19:22:38] <MikeyD> djQuery: yep, and i found this example too, which pretty much does what i want, but im having trouble translating it into my own fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamietre/U97Lb/
[19:22:53] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide check the Net panel in your inspector or firebug to see if the page is returning anything at all.  you may be getting a server error page
[19:23:22] <Danny_B> example you have in html is good enough. .hide() hides it on page, right? let me try to rephrase - i need to get that "See also: " string to be reused. (the deal is, that this string is always different by language, so if i want to create another section with "see also:" this is the only way how to get the proper label. unfortunately i can't change the html, so it will remain unwrapped text
[19:23:32] <Danny_B> djQuery: ^^
[19:24:14] <djQuery> Danny_B, see ?internationalization
[19:24:15] <bot-t> Danny_B, #8419 (Ajax calls to encoded Internationalized domain names ... - Opened 12 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8419
[19:24:32] <gen0cide> LocalPCGUY: The post data goes through alright, but I still dont see a response
[19:24:58] <djQuery> Danny_B, why didnt you say so earlier http://code.google.com/p/jquery-i18n-properties/
[19:25:09] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide what is the response code for that page via the AJAX call? (200 would be ideal, obviously)
[19:25:23] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide also, have you programmed that page to return a response?
[19:26:21] <Fenikkusu> dblosevn, I think I've finally understand this...sorta. It turns out that o.prototype is only set if you use a maker function. If instead you use Object.create, it doesn't. Don't quite understand this myself, but at least that explains the reason behind the error I was getting.
[19:26:23] <anonychus> djQuery: please which book of jquery is good for local storage and sync?
[19:26:55] <gen0cide> LocalPCGUY: 200, this is the php:    $msg->message['error'] = true;    $msg->message['message'] = "Hm, looks like you're already on the list. Talk soon.";    return json_encode($msg->message);
[19:27:13] <djQuery> anonychus, local storage is not related to jquery or jquery mobile.
[19:27:29] <gen0cide> LocalPCGUY: I can post data fine to to the php script, because whatever I type it puts it in the DB I have.
[19:27:35] <djQuery> anonychus, I havent bought a technical book in at least 8 years
[19:27:42] <nitrix_> How can I convert a string to an array of one element ?
[19:28:26] <nitrix_> nvm I'll just do myArray[0] = oldVar;
[19:28:45] <anonychus> djquery: but syncronization examples where i can find?
[19:28:51] <djQuery> nitrix_, not jquery related but    var x = 'test,abc,xyz'.join(',')
[19:29:17] <nitrix_> it's only one word, there's nothing to split on :/
[19:29:43] <djQuery> sorry split not join
[19:30:03] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide try echo json_encode($msg->message); instead of return ...
[19:30:16] <djQuery> nitrix_, then you would get back an array that has a length of 1
[19:30:33] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide you also may need to set the content type header - header('Content-Type: application/json');
[19:31:50] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ukudum/2/edit
[19:32:08] <anonychus> djQuery: do you have synchronization examples as jquery ?
[19:32:22] <djQuery> anonychus, nopers
[19:32:27] <anonychus> ok thanks
[19:32:27] <RobW> djQuery: you spelled supercalifragilisticexpialidocious wrong
[19:32:56] <djQuery> RobW, dang outa spelin bee again
[19:33:22] <gen0cide> LocalPCGuy: Ok I did both and now it says the response is "null". which is better than before because I wasn't getting anything.
[19:34:14] <djQuery> love it when people ask what they are failing at instead of explainin what they are trying to accomplish
[19:34:31] <RobW> djQuery: i see what you're trying to accomplish though :\
[19:34:32] <MikeyD> djQuery: i updated to this: http://jsfiddle.net/n4Wqn/3/ from using this example ( http://jsfiddle.net/jamietre/U97Lb/ ) but i cant get a tooltip to show when i click on texas.
[19:34:44] <Danny_B> djQuery: i can not hardcode any message in script. i must keep the one which i get from that element to keep the consistency.
[19:35:07] <ctx_> Im trying to pass the input of form as the var "searchkeyword" to an API call, where
[19:35:07] <ctx_> keyword=searchkeyword .. the variable isn't being set, what am i doing wrong: e.g.:
[19:35:07] <ctx_>  var searchkeyword = $("#searchterm").val(); ....
[19:35:07] <ctx_> $.getJSON("http://dev.domain.com/proxy.php?url=http://www.domain.com/search.json?keyword
[19:35:07] <ctx_> =searchkeyword&callback=?", ..
[19:37:31] <gen0cide> LocalPCGuy: I tried "echo: json_encode(array("success" => true)); " and I saw it in firebug. Lol thanks I shouldve used echo and not return
[19:38:13] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide yup, I think you just need to debug your PHP to  see where your NULL is coming from
[19:38:56] <gen0cide> LocalPCGuy: Alright Ill try to get it going from here, thanks for your help
[19:39:02] <LocalPCGuy> np
[19:41:15] <djQuery> MikeyD, go it to show on hover http://jsfiddle.net/n4Wqn/4/
[19:45:03] <MikeyD> djQuery: sweet! and I got another one added in, so I learned that much so far. heh. now, how do i move the tooltips to showup below in a div like http://jsfiddle.net/jamietre/U97Lb/ - having trouble making that jump
[19:47:08] <Marcky> how can i store a dialog in a variable and open it later
[19:47:11] <Marcky> lets say
[19:47:42] <Marcky> var dlg = $("#mydiv").dialog("options",{options:value});
[19:47:53] <Marcky> how can i use dlg to open it?
[19:51:32] <Marcky> anybody here?
[19:51:36] <Marcky> i need help
[19:51:37] <Marcky> o.o
[19:51:55] <Richhh> here
[19:51:55] <joshuabud> Ask your question if someone can help they will :)
[19:51:55] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot jsfiddle @ Marcky
[19:52:19] <PIKER_32> if someone is trying to put an object inside of $(...) - what are they trying to do?
[19:52:27] <Richhh> ill try Marcky
[19:52:45] <Richhh> pm if u like
[19:52:51] <Marcky> ok
[19:52:59] <LocalPCGuy> Marcky dialog from jquery UI?
[19:53:10] <olorin> hello, if I have a string of elements like that a a a a div a a div a div and I want to shift every div one tick left (a a a div a a div a div a) can I try something like $(".menuBar > div").prev().appendTo() ?
[19:53:29] <Marcky> @LocalPcGuy : Yes
[19:53:40] <LocalPCGuy> olorin you might use .before()
[19:53:43] <PIKER_32> also, not sure if that is jquery specific
[19:54:11] <PIKER_32> i see the $ and automatically think they are trying to hook it to that identifier
[19:54:13] <LocalPCGuy> olorin but your selector will get ALL of the divs that are direct children of menuBar
[19:54:26] <olorin> I want only shift divs
[19:54:43] <olorin> before the a they are currently after
[19:55:19] <LocalPCGuy> olorin right, but you will get a collection of all of the divs, and if you just do .prev().appendTo() it'll move ALL of them to be before the last a before the last div
[19:55:38] <LocalPCGuy> olorin (I believe)
[19:55:38] <olorin> do I need some each thing?
[19:56:05] <olorin> each()?
[19:56:14] <LocalPCGuy> olorin yah, I think you need to do each, so you only are addressing a single div.  then you can do something like:
[19:56:49] <coldhead> and watch the waves and move the faders
[19:56:51] <LocalPCGuy> ologin $('.menuBar > div').each(function() { $(this).before($(this).prev()) });
[19:57:39] <olorin> $(".menuBar > div").each().before().appenTo() ?
[19:57:58] <LocalPCGuy> olorin no-see my last post
[19:58:01] <olorin> I'm tempted to use pure javascript
[19:58:32] <Marcky> ok so heres my question again.. I want tot store a jquery dialog object inside a variable and open it later like the following :
[19:58:33] <Marcky>  var dlg = $("#mydiv").dialog("options",{options:value});
[19:58:43] <coldhead> why do you need to do this olorin
[20:00:20] <zubelgenubi> I have a weird greyish bar across the screen on a jquery mobile form, only in blackberry
[20:00:36] <zubelgenubi> replicated in bb simulator, but cant figure out what it is
[20:00:56] <zubelgenubi> I have a screenshot, what's a good way to share pics?
[20:00:56] <olorin> coldhead: all the a are set to inline-block, the divs are set to absolute and a top margin, so it will be a hover drop down, but the divs are shifted and not under the good a, if I move them with margins, since they are absolute, they will be all stick to the main contener
[20:00:57] <LocalPCGuy> olorin mine should have been insertBefore()
[20:01:50] <olorin> LocalPCGuy: thanks, seems what I wanted
[20:02:59] <chronos> ahn, if I will trigger a custom event, named in case pluginName + ".inputLoaded" how is best way to listen to it?
[20:03:08] <LocalPCGuy> Marcky can't you just setup the dialog and store a reference to the DOM element it is on, and then call .dialog('open') on that variable later?
[20:03:58] <chronos> how I can do, as example, $('td').inplaceEdit({inputLoaded: function(e){}}) ?
[20:04:08] <chronos> I need to bind it first to than trigger?
[20:04:14] <LocalPCGuy> Markcy var $dlg = $("#mydiv"); $dlg.dialog("options",{options:value}); .... sometime later in the code: $dlg.dialog("open");
[20:04:35] <chronos> since this function will be in my options obj
[20:10:57] <zubelgenubi> anyone want to help tackle a jquery mobile browser display problem on a specific phone?
[20:15:50] <djQuery> zubelgenubi, sure fedex me the phone
[20:16:59] <djQuery> MikeyD, did you read the docs concerning tooltipcontainer?
[20:17:14] <djQuery> toolTipContainer: '<div> ... </div>' | html string | jQuery object
[20:18:17] <MikeyD> djq
[20:18:24] <RonWhoCares> Is there a way to get JQuery Related Selects to work outside of the context of a form ?
[20:18:40] <MikeyD> djQuery: yes, i've been staring at them. i'm onto this revision: http://jsfiddle.net/n4Wqn/5/ but am still not getting it
[20:18:40] <zubelgenubi> Thanks dj, but I have a better idea - download the blackberry 9360 simulator and see it yourself
[20:19:09] <zubelgenubi> of course the one phone i need my webapp to work on has quirks...
[20:19:36] <gen0cide> How do I access this json array:  {"array":{"error":true,"message":"Hm, looks like you're already on the list. Talk soon."}}
[20:20:22] <gen0cide> Im trying this: var dasResponse = $.parseJSON(derResponse); then im printing dasResponse.message   , but nothign is showing up, hmm/
[20:20:32] <systemfault> theVariableThatContainsThatCrap['array']['error'] ?
[20:20:52] <systemfault> The backend did a shitty jobâ€¦ got hit the bastard.
[20:21:05] <gen0cide> Lol I would be hiting myself
[20:21:24] <LocalPCGuy> gen0cide you shouldn't need to parse that - derResponse.array.error
[20:22:30] <gen0cide> $msg->array['message'] = "Hm, looks like you're already on the list. Talk soon."; I dont think I can redact the array. Is there a way?
[20:23:09] <foo> How can I only have this return true if it is defined? if ($(this).find('[name=part_number]').val().length > 0)
[20:23:20] <foo> eg. if $(this).find('[name=part_number]') is not defined, don't return true
[20:24:34] <foo> I'm getting this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[20:24:40] <foo> the problem: sometimes it's defined, sometimes it's not
[20:24:44] <foo> I only want to check when it's defined
[20:26:37] <djQuery> MikeyD, what I dont understand is why they dont take the tooltip from the html instead of having to something else in the code
[20:28:01] <MikeyD> djQuery: yeah, its very confusing to me. here is another demo they have: http://jsfiddle.net/nYkAG/ - i've tried copying that one too but it wont work on my own fiddle/map.
[20:30:36] <gen0cide> I have this json array now. how would I access message?  {"error":true,"message":"Hm, looks like you're already on the list. Talk soon."}
[20:32:02] <trinadh> varName.message
[20:33:38] <chronos> I'm writing a plugin. It is started in a $("td.someClass"). at some point I trigger in a input with $("td span.edit input").trigger('customEvent'); ... but 'this' in binded function is TD, not INPUT, and if I use $.proxy I get window... how I can get input?!
[20:34:30] <coldhead> but we've taken this long so why so starry eyed
[20:35:12] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ chronos
[20:35:13] <bot-t> chronos, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[20:35:23] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[20:35:23] <bot-t> Not much dude, jusâ€™ hanginâ€™ â€™nâ€™ chillinâ€™
[20:36:49] <tw2113> bot-t, are you sleeping with my girlfriend?
[20:36:50] <bot-t> tw2113, Most likely.
[20:36:55] <tw2113> you whore!
[20:37:03] <tw2113> also, who's my girlfriend? i wanna meet her finally
[20:37:56] <coldhead> you can't expect bot-t to keep track of all her assignations
[20:38:24] <foo> $(this).find('[name=part_number]').size() > 0 is what I want, I think.
[20:38:25] * foo tries
[20:38:45] <chronos> Eviltwin: the code isnt even on alfa ...
[20:39:03] <chronos> just want to know if is possible define what is 'this' when use trigger :)
[20:39:46] <charlieg> can i do: var x = $("#x"); x.click(... etc);
[20:39:58] <charlieg> or, more specifically
[20:40:08] <coldhead> chronos: can you do var that = this; when this has a good value, and then refer to it later as `that`
[20:40:40] <charlieg> var y = $("<div></div>"); y.append("<h1>example</h1>"); // then add y to a page
[20:40:47] <chronos> sending as parameter, is a way :)
[20:41:15] <Eviltwin> chronos: I'm not trying to see a full plugin
[20:41:27] <Eviltwin> chronos: I'm trying to see a snippet that shows what's not working for you
[20:41:31] <chronos> but is weird that I trigger a event in one input and 'this' in function is other elment.
[20:42:12] <Eviltwin> chronos: Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/NWKVD/
[20:42:19] <Eviltwin> That shows what's happening that you're not expecting
[20:42:28] <Eviltwin> Here "this" is the element the event was triggered on
[20:42:51] <chronos> k, I'll post, brb
[20:42:53] <Eviltwin> If you call another function inside, its "this" won't be the element
[20:42:57] <Eviltwin> You can just ammend that
[20:43:10] <chronos> first time using jsfiddle
[20:43:18] <chronos> also, first time writing a plugin
[20:43:20] <thisboy> Eviltwin: hey man
[20:43:27] <thisboy> Eviltwin: just curious, what's your first choice, " or '?
[20:43:58] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[20:44:07] <chronos> depends of humour
[20:44:10] <chronos> hehe
[20:44:43] <thisboy> trying to make my js more consistent by choosing a default type of quotation marks
[20:45:00] <Eviltwin> I usually prefer "" since more languages use that as strings than ''
[20:45:06] <thisboy> so it's either "...''..." or '...""...'
[20:45:10] <Eviltwin> But CSS selectors are supposed to use "" for attributes etc
[20:45:11] <thisboy> cool
[20:45:22] <Eviltwin> So I generally use '' for selectors that might involve an attribute selector
[20:45:29] <Eviltwin> Like $('input[name="foo"]')
[20:45:31] <LocalPCGuy> I generally use single quotes so I can put html with double quotes in it
[20:45:36] <thisboy> ah yeah
[20:45:38] <thisboy> that makes sense
[20:45:43] <LocalPCGuy> had to retrain my fingers when I switched
[20:45:48] <thisboy> =)
[20:45:50] <Eviltwin> input[name='foo'] is technically not correct (but will work in jQuery)
[20:46:11] <thisboy> yep it's a little special case there
[20:46:27] <thisboy> thanks man
[20:48:05] <coldhead> i'm with you, LocalPCGuy
[20:48:35] <coldhead> also ' uses fewer pixels which means it's better for the environment
[20:48:38] <coldhead> probably
[20:48:42] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[20:49:12] <LocalPCGuy> easier on the fingers - don't have to hit shift
[20:49:23] <LocalPCGuy> less overall keystrokes
[20:49:42] <thisboy> hehe
[20:50:56] <coldhead> fewer*
[20:55:05] <foo> Does find() support wildcard? eg. *
[20:55:16] <Eviltwin> Yes but using * is generally ill-advised
[20:55:17] <groundup> Playing around with the resizable interaction. I have two divs which are absolutely positioned on the page (100% height). They are supposed to take up the width of the window. So, when I resize the one on the left (the side bar) it should resize the left one. I don't want to make them both resizable, just the one on the left.
[20:56:18] <Eviltwin> groundup: That's a good question for #css
[20:57:18] <foo> find('[type=text]') should find text input types, right?
[20:57:24] <groundup> Eviltwin: it is resized with jQ UI. The events are caused by the resizable interaction
[20:57:24] <chronos> Eviltwin: there is, http://jsfiddle.net/chronossc/yTrb2/7/ , with full plugin
[20:57:57] <Eviltwin> groundup: You should avoid resizing via JavaScript when possible
[20:58:19] <Eviltwin> chronos: Where's the part that's not doing what you want it to do
[20:58:24] <chronos> Eviltwin: I trigger event on line 119 and listen to it on end of js
[20:58:24] <Eviltwin> I'm not going to read through all of this
[20:58:41] <foo> If find() matches multiple things, does it default to the first?
[20:58:45] <chronos> so u click on 0,00
[20:58:52] <Eviltwin> ?find @ foo
[20:58:52] <bot-t> foo, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[20:58:53] <chronos> and u will see event happen
[20:58:57] <Eviltwin> foo: Read
[20:59:19] <groundup> Under normal circumstances, I would use CSS to size everything. However, this application is completely built in JS.
[20:59:27] <foo> Eviltwin: checking
[20:59:29] <Cork> foo: find matches everything; some jquery functons might choose to only act on the first element in the list though
[20:59:29] <chronos> so the case is, I wanna a inputLoad event, and get this as td
[20:59:30] <foo> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[20:59:40] <Eviltwin> groundup: So no style whatsoever? Awesome
[20:59:52] <groundup> No, obviously it uses CSS
[21:01:07] <groundup> The output is generated via Mustache on the front-end and all of these UI elements are making it exceptionally hard to style. So, I am using JS to do the positioning and sizing after the elements are rendered
[21:01:58] <Eviltwin> chronos: I'm seeing a <td> as the "this" element
[21:01:59] <foo> Cork: $(this).find('[type=text]').val().length - this should return 2 items that match via find(), but it only seems to return the first. cool
[21:02:03] <foo> (that's what I want)
[21:02:11] <Cork> ?.val @ foo
[21:02:12] <bot-t> foo, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:02:15] <chronos> and I wanna input
[21:02:26] <Cork> foo: value of the first element in the set of matched elements <--
[21:02:32] <chronos> in line 119 u will see that I'm doing stuff with input and trigger it from a input, I guess
[21:02:56] <foo> ohhh, thanks Cork !
[21:02:57] <Eviltwin> chronos: Well .bind's this will always be the event you attached it to
[21:03:08] <Eviltwin> element*
[21:03:13] <Eviltwin> The element you attached it to
[21:03:15] <Cork> foo: $map($(this).find('[type=text]'), function(elm){ return $(elm).val(); }).length
[21:03:27] <Cork> opps
[21:03:32] <Cork> foo: meant $.map($(this).find('[type=text]'), function(elm){ return $(elm).val(); }).length
[21:03:40] <groundup> I will just use .resize on the .resizable() element
[21:03:45] <foo> Cork: interesting, and why not just use val() ?
[21:04:06] <chronos> event Eviltwin?
[21:04:13] <Eviltwin> foo: That's explained very clearly on the API page
[21:04:22] <Cork> foo: did you read what bot-t said?
[21:04:27] <chronos> it isnt element that I was did bind?
[21:04:40] <chronos> (I found now that e.target is the input
[21:04:45] <Cork> foo: "first element in the set of matched elements"
[21:04:49] <Eviltwin> foo: $("td").something().bind
[21:04:51] <Eviltwin> Guess what
[21:04:57] <Eviltwin> You just bound to those <td>s
[21:05:17] <foo> wait, right...
[21:05:29] <foo> Eviltwin: yes, val() grabs first element. But why not just use that?
[21:05:40] <Cork> foo: it returns a string; not an array
[21:05:40] <foo> I don't see anything about not using val() for first element only when there are multiple elements on http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:05:42] <chronos> I see... I was thinking that when bind this is always element that *triggered* event
[21:05:43] <foo> oh
[21:05:52] <foo> ohhh
[21:05:53] <Eviltwin> chronos: http://jsfiddle.net/yTrb2/8/
[21:05:55] <chronos> but I get td because of bubble right/
[21:05:57] <foo> Cork: yeah, I only care about the first match
[21:05:57] <chronos> ?
[21:06:01] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:06:03] <Eviltwin> It bubbles
[21:06:06] * foo has been working way too long today.
[21:06:12] <Eviltwin> "this" is defined to be the element it was attached to
[21:06:24] <Eviltwin> e.target is defined to be the element that was targeted
[21:06:52] <chronos> okz
[21:06:58] <Eviltwin> foo: Yeah, it's kind of everywhere on that page
[21:07:05] <chronos> I need to remember to document it for users of this plugin hehe
[21:07:17] <chronos> thx for help Eviltwin :)
[21:08:10] <chronos> lol, 3AM,need to sleep
[21:08:18] <chronos> cia peopla
[21:08:20] <chronos> *people
[21:08:49] <foo> Eviltwin: Just so we're on the same page, you're saying that that page says why I should *not* use val() on something that returns multiple elements, right? (even if I only care about first result only?) (I just read the whole page, saw nothing, then again, my mind is numb because I've been at it for 12 hours today. must. finish. this. then. sleep.)
[21:09:28] <Cork> foo: no, it does not say that
[21:09:28] <Eviltwin> Top of the page: "Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements or set the value of every matched element."
[21:10:02] <gen0cide> I can't seem to parse the json for somereason: var dasResponse = $.parseJSON(derResponse);   var dieResponse = dasResponse.message; Its not outputing the message
[21:10:27] <foo> Cork: oh, ok
[21:10:34] <gen0cide> This is the json array:  {"error":true,"message":"Hm, looks like you're already on the list. Talk soon."}
[21:11:09] <Cork> gen0cide: your sure the response haven't been converted to an object already by jquery?
[21:11:22] <Cork> if the server sends the correct mimetype that should happen by default
[21:12:09] <gen0cide> Cork: Ya I have this on the first line of my php file: header('Content-Type: application/json');
[21:12:35] <Cork> gen0cide: so just remove the $.pparseJSON line
[21:14:38] <gen0cide> Cork: Heh that works
[21:14:39] <gen0cide> Thanks
[21:19:21] <MikeyD> how can i modify this javascript to open up in target_parent - not target_blank? http://jsfiddle.net/aGHwz/
[21:20:12] <MikeyD> nevermind, i'm a  moron!
[21:23:27] <zubelgenubi> guys I'm still stuck on this stupid grey bar in blackberry browser.  Any tips on troubleshooting problems like this?   is there a firebug for blackberry browsers?
[21:25:47] <zubelgenubi> its a jquery mobile problem. It only happens, that ive seen, to blackberry browsers. but it is replicable - on the bb simulator
[21:35:29] <zubelgenubi> here's the source http://pastebin.com/fRJQF2n6
[21:35:59] <zubelgenubi> the grey bar appears where I put !!!!! There is a grey bar that appears here for some reason in blackberry browser   !!!!!!
[21:36:08] <zubelgenubi> about 1/3 of the way down the code
[21:36:17] <zubelgenubi> And I see no reason for it
[21:38:19] <zubelgenubi> I have lots of forms in this webapp, and don't get the problem anywhere else
[21:47:50] <zubelgenubi> whoa!   new development - when I zoom in on the grey box, it disappears and shows normal.  When zoomed to 100%, the grey box reappears.  Just north of the select input.
[21:52:46] <coldhead> you are in a special kind of hell, zubelgenubi :(
[21:54:29] <MikeyD> ugh, copied code to jsfiddle. runs perfectly. copied over to server. stops working. used <script type='text/javascript'>//<![CDATA[
[21:54:29] <MikeyD> $(window).load(function(){ too
[21:55:42] <zubelgenubi> Sartre couldnt even imagine this hell, coldhead
[21:56:05] <zubelgenubi> I'm getting closer though, commenting out elements one at a time and refreshing to see if it went away...
[21:57:45] <coldhead> the saddest part is no one even uses blackberries
[21:58:21] <thisboy> haha
[21:58:36] <zubelgenubi> nobody but my clients, right?
[21:58:36] <thisboy> oh yep
[21:58:44] <zubelgenubi> so it goes
[21:59:55] <coldhead> as far as i can tell the international blackberry market is now a couple of guys in brazil
[22:00:25] <MikeyD> ok, so the javascript on jsfiddle returns 0 errors, but on my server i get 2 errors. line 1730 and line 1695. why!??! http://www.outsharked.com/scripts/jquery.imagemapster.js
[22:04:39] <tw2113> *shrug*
[22:05:45] <tw2113> what errors
[22:08:52] <Eviltwin> MikeyD: Probably a different version of jQuery
[22:10:28] <MikeyD> yea, it was the version. i went back to 1.6.2 and it works fine
[22:11:39] <zubelgenubi> well, when I have more than four divs with data-role="fieldcontain" in my form the grey box shows up.  Doesnt matter which ones. Doesn't matter which order.
[22:12:30] <zubelgenubi> three is ok.   four bad.    go figure
[22:16:12] <MikeyD> http://jsfiddle.net/DJfUe/ - how come that works fine in opening the parent in jsfiddle, but not on the live server? cant figure it out
[22:16:30] <MikeyD> i feel like i fix one issue only to create another
[22:16:50] <Tark> hello! What is wrong with this? Why I can't handle click in added div? http://pastebin.com/WF1WQ6Yq
[22:17:04] <foo> I want to do UPDATE table SET X='' WHERE id IS GREATER THAN 22    - is there a way to do something like that? eg. update all rows where the id number is above 22 ?
[22:17:46] <Eviltwin> foo: You want to do a SQL query?
[22:18:09] <foo> Eviltwin: I'm sorry, wrong channel.
[22:18:21] <Eviltwin> WHERE id > 22
[22:18:25] * foo is going to call it quits after this, darn 14 hour days
[22:18:28] <foo> Eviltwin: ahhhh! thank you!
[22:18:41] <RonWhoCares> What change is needed to the script to clear the DIV  "   the_verse_of_the_day_recurring_donation_container   "  each time the  " Donation Frequency " is changed?   http://jsfiddle.net/h3kdt/
[22:20:12] <Eviltwin> RonWhoCares: Add a $("div.the_verse_of_the_day_recurring_donation_container").empty() ?
[22:20:28] <Eviltwin> Inside the change handler
[22:22:55] <RonWhoCares> Thank you.
[22:23:47] <MikeyD> http://jsfiddle.net/DJfUe/Â - why is this stupid onClick opening the target as a blank and not parent?
[22:26:02] <Eviltwin> MikeyD: Uh... "e.e.preventDefault();"
[22:26:27] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ MikeyD
[22:26:28] <bot-t> MikeyD, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:26:31] <Eviltwin> Read through that at some point
[22:26:37] <Eviltwin> Lots of super useful debugging tricks for JavaScript
[22:26:52] <MikeyD> i removed             e.e.preventDefault(); - still didnt work
[22:27:00] <MikeyD> and i favorited that, thank you
[22:27:34] <Eviltwin> Well I unfortunately know nothing about the mapster plugin or how well its written
[22:28:08] <Eviltwin> I can tell you that "this" likely refers to the <img> and not the <area>
[22:28:14] <Eviltwin> And you might want to consider e.target
[22:28:40] <Eviltwin> If you know how to use the console, I suggest using console.log(this); and console.log(e.target) to see what they refer to
[22:28:57] <MikeyD> playing with the mapster plugin is my jump into javascript. i dont really know what im doing
[22:29:30] <Eviltwin> This might help: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?docs.html#onclick
[22:29:48] <Eviltwin> If those terms make any sense to you
[22:30:07] <Eviltwin> It seems "this" should refer to the <area>
[22:30:48] <Eviltwin> And e.e.preventDefault() may have been right after all
[22:30:49] <Eviltwin> Sorry about that
[22:31:00] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize they changed the signature
[22:31:01] <MikeyD> hrm
[22:31:23] <MikeyD> the debugger doesnt show any errors
[22:31:40] <Eviltwin> Do you know about breakpoints?
[22:31:56] <MikeyD> just got to them on the slideshow!
[22:32:03] <Eviltwin> Cool those should help
[22:32:10] <Eviltwin> It lets you stop the JavaScript from running
[22:32:16] <Eviltwin> So you can look at what the vars are and stuff
[22:32:22] <Eviltwin> Might help you figure out what's up
[22:33:06] <mmlac> I am using jQuery UI to have two sortable lists. How can I make the first one a "generator" list that only allows items to be dragged OUT. As soon they are dragged into the new list, the list they were dragged from "replenishes" the dragged out object.
[22:33:41] <mmlac> Is there a way to accomplish this without manual draggable / droppable handling?
[22:33:51] <mmlac> And utilizing the sortable code
[22:34:16] <MikeyD> Eviltwin: ok, setup a breakpoint, then reloaded. not quite sure what i did or what to look for
[22:35:08] <tw2113> MikeyD, may be worth googling for a breakpoint tutorial
[22:35:22] <tw2113> insert your browser in the search query for more targeted
[22:35:51] <mmlac> ok solved the "one way only" part.
[22:36:09] <mmlac> Any way to create the new element in the drop-list but not remove the drag-item?
[22:36:36] <Tark> $(id + ' .plus').css({"display": ''}); -- is this a right way?
[22:41:37] <MikeyD> hm. ran the page through as many breakpoints as it'd let me. couldn't get anything to show up in console
[22:41:37] <Eviltwin> MikeyD: What a breakpoint means is that when the code reaches that point it'll stop and you can use the debugger to see what's going on there
[22:41:58] <Eviltwin> Sometimes it works better if you put "debugger;" in the source instead
[22:42:12] <Eviltwin> You may need the console open when you refresh
[22:42:19] <Eviltwin> Not just after refresh
[22:44:36] <MikeyD> would you mind if i pm'd you the live link? i added debugger to the code
[22:45:32] <Eviltwin> I like to keep the conversation in #jquery so everyone can contribute
[22:45:39] <Eviltwin> I don't know how long I'll be able to stick around
[22:48:49] <MikeyD> ok, maybe i just need to get some sleep and try again in the morning
[22:49:28] <coldhead> wise words
[22:51:42] <tw2113> coldhead can help!
[22:53:30] <mmlac> Anyone knows how to prevent the remove event in a jQuery UI sortable?
[22:53:43] <MikeyD> ok, goodnight. thanks for the links and info to figure out the debugging stuff!
[22:55:50] <mmlac> nvm solved it ;)
[23:09:18] <fattestduck> Hello
[23:09:54] <fattestduck> I found a cool jsfiddle shine effect (http://jsfiddle.net/necolas/fpfZb/) I was wondering how i can put that shine effect on an image. can any1 help
[23:11:29] <Martin-I-de-NRW> Hi, I've  a problem. I want to make a jQuery-Object out of "this". <div onclick="myjs(this)">...</div>  function myjs(oObj) {  oObj.parent() } <- brings an error because oObj has no function .parent(). So what can I do to make oObj an jQuery object?
[23:11:47] <fattestduck> im new to jquery sorry
[23:12:18] <Cork> Martin-I-de-NRW: 1. don't use inline event attributes, 2. $(oObj)
[23:12:31] <fattestduck> I found a cool jsfiddle shine effect (http://jsfiddle.net/necolas/fpfZb/) I was wondering how i can put that shine effect on an image. can any1 help
[23:12:53] <Martin-I-de-NRW> Cork: how you would have done this?
[23:13:13] <Cork> Martin-I-de-NRW: unobstructive js
[23:13:43] <Cork> ex. $(document).on('click', 'a.myfilter', function() { $(this).parent() });
[23:14:01] <Cork> then you add the class to the element that should trigger the event
[23:15:14] <Martin-I-de-NRW> Cork: Ok, I'll try to change it
[23:26:31] <noregret> how can I set an attrib in a html string ? e.g. var v='html string'; $(v).attr('title', 'blah') didn't work out, am I doing something wrong ?
[23:34:08] <tw2113> noregret, are you able to control the variable assignment and what goes in it?
[23:34:34] <noregret> tw2113: php is sending it, but yeah i can
[23:34:48] <tw2113> i was thinking more the html side
[23:34:52] <noregret> tw2113: actualy, it's just an <img> element, othing more
[23:35:06] <noregret> tw2113: yeah, php is sending the html i meant
[23:35:25] <tw2113> i think i saw you earlier asking the same thing and i remember someone giving you a stackoverflow link
[23:35:54] <tw2113> solution to the thread, if i recall right, was to put the variable into the dom, and then re-select it and add the attr then
[23:35:58] <tw2113> just the part you need
[23:36:04] <noregret> ah
[23:36:08] <noregret> i should add it
[23:36:45] <noregret> tw2113: so I should make it hidden.. ? i dont want it to appear
[23:37:06] <tw2113> huh
[23:37:26] <tw2113> how does not making it appear relate to title attributes
[23:37:58] <noregret> tw2113: I am not appending right away, i am preparing that string to be appended later on with other strings if you know what i mean
[23:38:11] <noregret> i'll show you
[23:38:53] <noregret> tw2113: http://pastie.org/5853737 something like that
[23:38:56] <tw2113> add the title attribute after whenever you move all of it to the dom then
[23:39:06] <noregret> tw2113: and my issue is with 'aimg'
[23:39:51] <noregret> tw2113: well, the title content is only available in that context
[23:39:55] <tw2113> does $this->Html->image() not allow for other attributes?
[23:40:44] <tw2113> odd content for a title attribute: var title = attachments.join( "<br />" );
[23:41:35] <noregret> tw2113: yeah, because it's going to be a tooltip
[23:41:52] <noregret> tw2113: sure, image() does allow other attribs
[23:42:46] <tw2113> dunno
[23:42:55] <foo> will this this: gravity_form_event.preventDefault(); - cancel out this: $(gravity_form_event.srcElement).click(); ?
[23:43:20] <Cork> no
[23:44:09] <Cork> preventDefault only prevents the default click action on an element; it doesn't affect any event listeners unless it actively checks for it
[23:44:27] <foo> Cork: ok, thanks
[23:44:37] * foo is stumped why this is happening
[23:44:40] * foo tries something else
[23:45:24] <Cork> foo: if the event handler check event.defaultPrevented it would prevent it
[23:45:42] <noregret> tw2113: thanks anyway
[23:45:50] <Cork> foo: do you use a return false in your event listener?
[23:45:51] <noregret> maybe Cork can help:P
[23:45:55] <Cork> *are you using
[23:46:07] <Cork> help with what?
[23:46:40] <tw2113> trying to add a title attribute to part of the contents of a variable
[23:46:46] <foo> Cork: I don't think so, hm /me checks
[23:46:54] <noregret> Cork: http://pastie.org/5853737
[23:47:14] <noregret> Cork: the issue with 'aimg'.. the attrib isn't set and i want to set it..
[23:47:46] <Cork> aimg would have to be a dom reference
[23:48:06] <noregret> meaning ?
[23:48:32] <noregret> should be appeneded to the dom ?
[23:48:52] <Cork> $(amng).attr right now parses the html into dom, sets the title attr on something (the first element in the html string)
[23:49:08] <Cork> then throws that dom away and your left with the original html string
[23:49:49] <Cork> this is a common miss conception from when ppl think that a browser works on html
[23:50:00] <Cork> it doesn't it works on dom and the html is just a string
[23:50:15] <noregret> i see
[23:50:26] <noregret> looks like I have to manually contrcust construct the string
[23:50:33] <Cork> so what you can do is converting content to dom
[23:50:39] <Cork> search for the img element
[23:50:45] <Cork> then set the title
[23:51:03] <noregret> $(aimg).find('img').attr() ?
[23:51:19] <Cork> content = $(content); content.find('img').attr('title, title); return content
[23:51:30] <Cork> noregret: you can't replace things in the string
[23:51:33] <Cork> remember what i just said
[23:51:45] <nesoi> hello... does anyone here know how I would make a jquery mobile Search filter list with dividers and with checkboxes to select one or more entries?
[23:52:11] <foo> Cork: may I PM you?
[23:52:15] <nesoi> I'm just starting to look at jquery, sorry if it's a silly question
[23:52:36] <noregret> Cork: thank yuou very much
[23:52:41] <Cork> noregret: sure alternatively you can do var domimg = $('<div/>').append(aimg); domimg.find('img').attr('title', title); aimg = domimg.html()
[23:52:47] <Cork> but thats a bit nasty
[23:52:56] <noregret> Cork: but i thought when i do $(x) then it is convereted to dom
[23:53:07] <noregret> i se
[23:53:08] <noregret> e
[23:53:09] <Cork> noregret: sure, the result is
[23:53:18] <Cork> $(aimg) returns a dom element
[23:53:23] <Cork> aimg is still the original string
[23:53:34] <noregret> ok, I get it
[23:53:42] <Cork> foo: preferably not
[23:54:22] <nesoi> hm.. let me restate with more correct terminology: how I would make a jquery mobile Search filter listview with dividers and with checkboxes to select one or more entries?
[23:55:15] <foo> Cork: ok
[23:55:59] <nesoi> or is that not easily do-able?
[23:56:31] <Cork> nesoi: you would have to wait for someone that know the mobile lib better
[23:56:51] <nesoi> cork, thanks... for some reason there's a channel #jquerymobile but it's invite only!
[23:57:28] <Cork> nesoi: on freenode # is for organisations/groups and ## is for community
[23:57:35] <nesoi> cork if there's a regular jquery listview though, how would you add checkboxes to each entry?
[23:57:44] <nesoi> ah thanks Cork
[23:57:54] <Cork> nesoi: i know almost nothing about jquery-mobile
[23:58:06] <noregret> Cork: if I do dom=$(x), can I use dom in a string for appending? or is there a method to convert dom back to string ?
[23:58:08] <nesoi> Cork : I mean in regular jquery, because it is probably similar?
[23:58:09] <Cork> i played with it a bit a few months ago and found it pointless
[23:58:34] <nesoi> what made you think it was pointless?
[23:58:34] <Cork> nesoi: jquery-mobile works quite different
[23:58:41] <Cork> nesoi: its structure
[23:58:51] <nesoi> hm.. jquery-mobile uses jquery though
[23:58:53] <Cork> it gives me nothing that i feel i need
[23:59:10] <Cork> nesoi: no jquery-mobile is built ontop of jquery
[23:59:24] <Cork> its mainly a replacement for jquery-ui
[23:59:28] <Cork> (for mobiles)
[23:59:54] <Cork> noregret: no you can't append dom to a string
