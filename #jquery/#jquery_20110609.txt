[00:12:13] <coreyman>  I don't understand why the 'slide' event isn't working well on this jquery slider, but the 'change' even works just fine, can anyone help me out? http://www.yourdomaingoeshere.com/testing2/reseller.html
[00:25:13] <johanhar> Hi. I made a function "hideOrders" that hide a div. In my template I made <a>-tag with href="javascript:hideOrders();" - when I click it it's not defined (firebug error)
[00:25:17] <johanhar> What can be wrong? :)
[00:26:04] <johanhar> I put the function in <script> in my <head> tag..
[00:27:05] <markj> ?events @ johanhar

[00:39:38] <juha____> hello people
[00:43:30] <bobbobbins> so i just checked, and this has the value of a div, but if i do this.html it is telling me it isn't a function, what gives?
[00:48:49] <bobbobbins> bah, i'll ask around again in th emorning, im hitting it
[00:49:55] <Linkinus> good morning
[00:50:01] <Linkinus> anyone can recommend me a good jquery animation plugin?
[00:50:16] <Linkinus> i use spritely now but it seems slow any good alternatives to work with jquery and sprites?
[00:54:01] <millun> hi, $("input.variant").livequery is not a function
[00:56:47] <wib> Have you included "livequery" correctly?
[00:57:02] <wib> <script src="js/livequery.js"></script> or similar
[00:58:54] <millun> ah
[01:02:41] <phrearch> hello
[01:02:49] <phrearch> is it possible to add custom events to live?
[01:03:34] <phrearch> i found a mousehold function somewhere, like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403281/
[01:04:20] <Flavius_> how can i create an account on http://docs.jquery.com ?
[01:07:12] <Flavius_> anybody can tell my why i can not create an account at http://docs.jquery.com/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&returnto=Main_Page ?
[01:10:19] <phrearch> are there some docs how to use custom events with .live or .delegate?
[01:11:41] <Flavius_> anybody can tell my why i can not create an account at http://docs.jquery.com/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&returnto=Main_Page ?
[01:17:40] <phrearch> currently trying to trigger a future mousehold event like: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403285/
[01:30:09] <PaybackTony> Thank god there is a jquery IRC
[01:30:37] <PaybackTony> If anyone is awake, maybe you could help me out
[01:32:27] <PaybackTony> so I have a draggable inside a div with overflow:hidden. I have a button that toggles the overflow to auto. When I drag the element partially off the div to the left or top, and then set the scroll to auto, the div doesn't scroll to the left (as if there was no content to scroll too). Does the same with the top. Works on right and bottom though.
[01:39:06] <phrearch> hm, any idea why this only is firing once? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403299/
[01:39:14] <phrearch> trying to make a bubbling mousehold
[01:43:07] <DukeDrake> hi
[01:43:27] <DukeDrake> which element would 'slideshow' addess? e.g. without a '#' or a '.' ?
[01:57:39] <WholemealLoaf> Am I right in thinking there was a bugfix somewhere since 1.4 which means you can properly grab height and width on elements that are hidden?
[01:59:31] <blackspotwiggins> WholemealLoaf, i dont think you can get dimensions of display:none elements
[02:00:13] <tarzeau> i put jquery supersized into a page, and i'm using some block/none hiding/showing parts
[02:00:26] <WholemealLoaf> Yeh that certainly seems to be the case in 1.4.2 but thought I remembered reading in release notes of a version since that it had been fixed
[02:00:42] <tarzeau> can someone have a look at tell me if it's possible to have different slideshows on different parts? http://sid.ethz.ch/.aiei/
[02:00:45] <WholemealLoaf> Hmm I'll try it out on jsFieddle I guess
[02:00:51] <WholemealLoaf> fiddle even
[02:02:06] <niftylettuce> anyone know of a sexy jquery palette besides the basics off google top 5 results?
[02:02:12] <niftylettuce> color palette, that is
[02:03:16] <blackspotwiggins> WholemealLoaf, try it in devtools
[02:03:59] <WholemealLoaf> blackspotwiggins, devtools?
[02:04:02] <blackspotwiggins> usually you can't get any results even there
[02:04:08] <blackspotwiggins> like firebug or chrome web developer
[02:04:31] <blackspotwiggins> there are some exceptions, but since the element is not in the page flow, you can't get accurate results anyway
[02:05:14] <ndeee> hi in the getJSON callback func, I fill an array with arr.push(); if I pass the array to another function to process it further, the array is empty
[02:05:23] <gnarf> WholemealLoaf: nope, height and width of display: none is unreliable
[02:05:37] <gnarf> WholemealLoaf: all CSS properties of elements off the DOM are also unreliable
[02:05:41] <ndeee> the array is defined above all functions as global var
[02:06:21] <WholemealLoaf> blackspotwiggins, gnarf, okay thanks guys, yeh seems like it can't be done that easily
[02:07:14] <WholemealLoaf> i'll look into some of the horrible sounding work-arounds that come up on google :/
[02:07:32] <blackspotwiggins> ?gl @ WholemealLoaf
[02:07:33] <bot-t> WholemealLoaf, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[02:07:38] <blackspotwiggins> it wont work
[02:11:47] <WholemealLoaf> suprised there's not a more common workaround tbh, it's something you want to do quite often if you want to resize a dialog in advance of revealing the content that will fill it.
[02:12:27] <WholemealLoaf> open dialog, ajax in content, resize the dialog keeping centered based on the content size, fade-in content.
[02:12:58] <blackspotwiggins> WholemealLoaf, you are doing it wrong
[02:13:06] <WholemealLoaf> in what sense?
[02:13:08] <juha____> i hate that jquery docs say that quotes are mandatory in attribute selectors, when they are not. either change the docs or "break" the code if not following documentation.
[02:13:29] <phrearch> anyone can give me a hint how to make a custom event bubble?
[02:13:44] <phrearch> im trying to use a mousehold function, like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403316/
[02:14:00] <blackspotwiggins> WholemealLoaf, there are many ways to do that..
[02:14:01] <phrearch> it works all fine, except when i want to use it as a delegate or live function
[02:14:15] <blackspotwiggins> offscreen rendering, not using display:none
[02:14:32] <Genk1> hello
[02:14:34] <WholemealLoaf> yes I read that as a suggestion
[02:15:05] <blackspotwiggins> phrearch, i had the same issue..
[02:15:38] <blackspotwiggins> maybe using custom $.Event can work
[02:15:39] <phrearch> blackspotwiggins: how did you solve it? seems like an event has to bubble in order to get noticed by delegate?
[02:15:41] <blackspotwiggins> haven't tried it
[02:16:09] <blackspotwiggins> i didnt want to waste too much time on it, made it without bubbling
[02:16:57] <phrearch> hm, i couldnt get that to work either. i added an interval timer, but that one only fires once
[02:19:13] <blackspotwiggins> you could try setting propagation properties manually
[02:19:15] <Yveiko> guys, how do you check if the whole page is loaded?
[02:19:25] <gnarf> Yveiko: define what you mean?
[02:19:51] <gnarf> likely the answer is "you don't"
[02:19:55] <Yveiko> i have a background, (image, positioned fixed with width:100% and height:100%) and I want it to fadeIn when the content is loaded
[02:20:09] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[02:20:10] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() jquery plugin Â— Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[02:20:50] <gnarf> "the content" is already there in a document ready, but i assume you mean you want the image to fadein after it has been loaded
[02:22:36] <blackspotwiggins> phrearch, source suggests setting isPropagationStopped to something that returns false
[02:23:31] <phrearch> blackspotwiggins: thanks ill check that.
[02:23:39] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: event.stopPropagation()
[02:24:06] <gnarf> phrearch: and yes, only bubbling events will reach delegate / live
[02:24:25] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, do you know about custom events not bubbling?
[02:24:34] <phrearch> gnarf: is it possible to fake this for a custom event?
[02:24:45] <gnarf> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/1acd358ceeacd67a google?
[02:24:50] <phrearch> currently have http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403319/
[02:25:39] <phrearch> i think it only works with .bind then?
[02:26:09] <Yveiko> that images loaded doesn't seem to be working for me
[02:27:32] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8712
[02:27:37] <gnarf> what version of jQuery are you using?
[02:27:44] <gnarf> cuz this appears to bubble all the way up in 1.6
[02:28:39] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/uAHqv/
[02:28:48] <iksik> hello
[02:29:27] <JSM87|2> Hi guys, im using prettyPhoto. Does anyone know how to make it so the NEXT and PREVIOUS button images are always visible, not just on mouse hover
[02:29:32] <iksik> is there any plugin which works like google autocomplete with full results? ( not with dropped select box with matched title only )
[02:30:49] <Ely^> !seen sean`
[02:30:57] <gnarf> .seen
[02:31:23] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, that example doesnt work for me :/
[02:31:29] <iksik> anyone? ;]
[02:31:45] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: put it on 1.6 and you'll see it bubble up and up
[02:31:46] <blackspotwiggins> ah, sry it does
[02:31:56] <mattyh88> hey, i'm receiving a json response on my page but how can I loop through the items with javascript?
[02:32:23] <blackspotwiggins> i was using $.event.trigger() for my app
[02:32:36] <mattyh88> when I loop through the items now .. i'm getting [0] = [, [1] = {, [2] = G and so on
[02:32:42] <gnarf> instead of .trigger() ?
[02:32:52] <blackspotwiggins> yeah i wanted to trigger it globally
[02:32:55] <blackspotwiggins> but it didnt work then
[02:33:08] <gnarf> mattyh88: sounds like you never set the dataType: "json"
[02:33:11] <blackspotwiggins> i'll try it again later
[02:33:23] <gnarf> mattyh88: likely you are iterating individual characters in the text response
[02:34:51] <phrearch> hm, 1.6 here. custom event triggering seems to work
[02:34:57] <mattyh88> gnarf: i've got it like this now: http://pastebin.com/dj1e57rT
[02:35:09] <iksik> hum, it seems that this kind of autocomplete doesn't exists yet ;<
[02:35:36] <gnarf> mattyh88: see ?$.parseJSON
[02:35:37] <bot-t> mattyh88, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[02:35:57] <gnarf> also don't loop arrays with for..in
[02:36:01] <mattyh88> okay ty :)
[02:36:07] <blamey> hey can someone recomend a tree control for jquery ? I had a look jsTree and Jquery UI Treecontrol, whcih doesn't seem to be actual release  ?
[02:36:08] <gnarf> use $.each - or iterate on .length
[02:36:18] <Ely^> .seen sean`
[02:36:18] <hsbot> sean` was seen 52 minutes and 42 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: COOL
[02:37:00] <Ely^> >_<
[02:44:06] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps , i'm having a strage one here, am getting a blank alert, the element this is tied to is an input element
[02:44:19] <mrmagoo1982> jQuery('.changer').live('blur',function(){  var myval = jQuery(this).val();alert(myval); })
[02:45:14] <iksik> god damn ;]
[02:45:45] <iksik> jQuery(this).val() ... why just not use this.value? o.O
[02:48:51] <mrmagoo1982> var myval = this.value;alert(myval); that shows as undefined
[02:50:05] <phrearch> blackspotwiggins: this seems to work => http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403327/
[02:50:18] <xec> mrmagoo1982: what is .changer selecting? is the class on the input element?
[02:50:28] <phrearch> gnarf: is this any good?
[02:50:40] <mrmagoo1982> yup
[02:50:45] <mrmagoo1982> its on the input element
[02:50:46] <phrearch> im triggering mousehold inside the mousedown function
[02:51:20] <mrmagoo1982> oh what a twonk
[02:51:27] <mrmagoo1982> is on the flipping label
[02:51:29] <mrmagoo1982> duuuuhhhh
[02:51:42] <xec> :D
[02:51:46] <mrmagoo1982> sorry, i'll go and give myself a slap!
[02:52:14] <rubydiamond_work> hi friends
[02:52:21] <rubydiamond_work> 	$.get("./templates/data_table.tpl.html", function(tpl) { .. }
[02:52:28] <rubydiamond_work> returns me tpl as xml in one case
[02:52:39] <rubydiamond_work> when I run it without webserver
[02:52:49] <rubydiamond_work> why is that..
[02:54:34] <xec> i honestly dont know, maybe doctype makes browser think its xml?
[03:06:40] <adac> Using ruby on rails I'm trying to replace a selectbox content, but somehow the content doesn't be replaced, seems that js(jquery) is not being executed: http://pastie.org/2041845 Any ideas?
[03:19:51] <rubydiamond_work> $.get("./templates/data_table.tpl.html") why does it return XML object
[03:20:02] <rubydiamond_work> when I use python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[03:20:08] <rubydiamond_work> it returns different object for that
[03:20:17] <pr0ton> hi
[03:20:27] <pr0ton> so i've got this .load function and after it completes
[03:20:34] <pr0ton> i can't acess the Div i loaded it into
[03:20:41] <pr0ton> i'm passing it a function handler
[03:27:53] <pr0ton> anybody?
[03:28:02] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps, i'm having a bit of trouble with my code http://www.pastie.org/2041932
[03:29:00] <mrmagoo1982> i'm simply trying to loop though each <li> of which has three inputs with the class changer, do input1*(input2+input3) and alert the total for each line
[03:29:13] <mrmagoo1982> i'm just getting undefined
[03:30:53] <oal> I'm trying to use jquery.template, but is there a way to run a loop x times (x is a template variable)? I tried "${ for(i=0; i < ${ settings.elems }; i++) }" but that doesn't work
[03:31:56] <huskyr> hi guys
[03:32:04] <huskyr> is there any way to do $.html() with a jQuery element?
[03:32:21] <huskyr> i'm looking for something like replaceAll() (that i can use with a jQ element)
[03:32:30] <huskyr> but that doesn't remove the node itself, just the inner contents
[03:34:04] <DukeDrake> when ther's an ul with "id=slideshow" ... and the js goes $('slideshow') ..... is this prototype syntax?
[03:36:24] <pr0ton> so i'm facing this issue
[03:36:39] <pr0ton> i'm loading a container of a page into, $('qdw')
[03:36:48] <pr0ton> but then the selectors dont work for the newly loaded content
[03:36:59] <khaan> hi everybody - i have a small n00b php question - can anyone help me? i am passing a variable to a function but instead of giving as output the number i'm passing from the array it's giving the variable name itself. Any idea?
[03:37:01] <pr0ton> the selectors are called in the complete function of load... so it's executing after it has loaded
[03:37:03] <pr0ton> any idea ?
[03:37:25] <phrearch> hm, is it possible to get a mouse position without using a mouse event?
[03:37:31] <rubydiamond_work> Anybody know why I need to run server for my jQuery example
[03:37:55] <rubydiamond_work> $.get("./templates/data_table.tpl.html")  behaves different with server and direct open html file in browser
[03:38:22] <pr0ton> rubydiamond_work, maybe because of the MIME header that you get
[03:38:23] <huskyr> rubydiamond: XMLhttpRequest doesn't work without a http connection
[03:38:28] <huskyr> afaik
[03:38:53] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: can I tell jQuery what type of document it is
[03:39:01] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: how to pass that
[03:39:09] <myle> hi there, could any1 xplain me how to do the $.post function for an array, i made an array with JQuery and want to transfer it to a php file but it wont work =(
[03:39:09] <rubydiamond_work> huskyr: I am using $.get
[03:39:19] <rubydiamond_work> huskyr: for accessing local file
[03:39:22] <huskyr> $.get uses xmlhttprequest on the inside
[03:39:24] <pr0ton> rubydiamond_work, if you're going to keep it on a server why not just access using the server's URL ?
[03:39:41] <huskyr> myle: use .serialize()
[03:39:44] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: I want to send this example to a remote colleage
[03:39:50] <MickeySoFine> hi all
[03:39:50] <huskyr> myle: or make a JSON string of it and use json_decode on the backend
[03:39:55] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: I don't want to tell her to run server
[03:40:04] <rubydiamond_work> she should just got and open index.html in the browser
[03:40:05] <pr0ton> why not host it somewhere?
[03:40:18] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: nope
[03:40:26] <rubydiamond_work> we don't have shared host in between
[03:40:38] <rubydiamond_work> she is trying to learn something..
[03:40:41] <pr0ton> ok, no idea then
[03:40:44] <rubydiamond_work> I want to send her demo
[03:40:53] <myle> .serialize() doesnt work so i quess i have to learn more about that JSON thing...*sob*
[03:40:57] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: can't I use $.get to open local files
[03:41:03] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: is there any other alternative
[03:41:07] <huskyr> myle: JSON is very easy
[03:41:07] <pr0ton> rubydiamond_work, read the docs
[03:41:17] <DukeDrake> when I try $(document).ready() it tells me 'document is null'
[03:41:19] <MickeySoFine> I have used live to bind a handler to an click event but when I click it appears to be firing twice. anyone know how to avoid this?
[03:41:23] <huskyr> myle: json_decode and json_encode are really easy in PHP
[03:41:28] <CKIDOW> and "very easy" means "VERY EASY"
[03:41:31] <CKIDOW> :)
[03:41:36] <DukeDrake> what's wrong here?
[03:41:47] <huskyr> MickeySoFine: you should be using delegate() instead of live()
[03:42:21] <CKIDOW> DukeDrake ... jquery isn't njected/used ?
[03:42:31] <rubydiamond_work> pr0ton: hmm
[03:42:33] <rubydiamond_work> okay
[03:47:06] <MickeySoFine> cheers huskyr
[03:47:12] <huskyr> you're welcome
[03:47:12] <MickeySoFine> worked a treat!
[03:47:17] <huskyr> avoid live() when you can
[03:47:24] <MickeySoFine> sure!
[03:47:38] <MickeySoFine> what about bind?
[03:47:43] <MickeySoFine> is tha bad too?
[03:51:11] <niftylettuce> how would I do something like this in jquery-color? http://pastie.org/private/3ej7tow1raq78mnpltyfog

[03:54:26] <entr> now i just recalled it and used it, it worked but couldn't find anything documented about it
[03:54:32] <entr> am i missing something?
[03:55:02] <oal> How would you do Python "for i in range(0,10)" in Javascript?
[03:55:37] <entr> oal: check this out -> http://yesudeep.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/implementing-a-pythonic-range-function-in-javascript-2/
[03:55:48] <oal> entr: thanks :)
[03:55:51] <entr> sry for the big tasty url
[03:57:42] <phrearch> hm, somehow .call doesnt pass the event object? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403370/
[04:00:54] <AdvoWork> how come when ive got a checkbox and am doing: $("#chosen_sortnew" + id).val()    and the checkbox was ticked, and im trying to untick, it still shows as "on"?
[04:01:21] <Genk1> how to pass a parameter that contains an 'url' ajax function ?
[04:02:06] <Genk1> for example : var url = '/test/communities/addFeed/http://www.facebook.com/;
[04:02:11] <Genk1> it deson't work
[04:08:47] <PeterB> I have an unordered list, and I want to produce an array of the <li> IDs. I know how to use .each() to process each li, but how can I combine them into a list?
[04:10:03] <blamey> PeterB: you mean place the id of the li into an array ?
[04:10:10] <PeterB> yes
[04:11:46] <blamey> var myArr = []; var index =0; $("li").each(function(){ myArr[index] = this.attr("id"); index++;}); somethign like that ?

[04:14:41] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[04:15:36] <Shwaiil> Q: Why doesnt this work on IE ? http://pastie.org/2042094 I have .live({  click fn() } ) for $('#el select option'). Any tip ? Thank you
[04:16:05] <PeterB> blamey: sort of, this worked in the end: $j(this).find('ul li').map(function() { return this.id }).get()
[04:16:50] <blamey> ok cool
[04:20:50] <Shwaiil> forget it. I changed to $(#el select) change
[04:20:51] <Shwaiil> solved.
[04:29:43] <AdvoWork> blamey, like: $("#chosen_sortnew" + i).val().is(":checked") ?
[04:30:11] <blamey> without the .val
[04:33:26] <blamey> AdvoWork: or you can do $("#chosen_sortnew" + i + ":checked")

[04:39:25] <johanhar> Hi. If I keep my .js in an external file, it will not run. I included it like I include the jquery-library it self... but the jQuery(document).ready(function() etc does not run when in external file - any suggestions?
[04:42:50] <monstermedo> hello
[04:42:57] <ramontayag> johanhar, it should run. maybe something else is wrong
[04:43:11] <ramontayag> make sure you include your js file after jquery
[04:44:20] <monstermedo> when doing a select with jquery  , how do i get the current elements attribute value ? something like $.plot($('.list').(this.attr('alt')) );
[04:45:02] <ramontayag> $('.list').attr('alt')
[04:45:31] <monstermedo> ramontayag: I need the element too
[04:45:49] <ramontayag> hmm.. then fetch it separately
[04:46:04] <monstermedo> loop ?
[04:46:31] <monstermedo> or you mean  $.plot($('.list'), $('.list').(this.attr('alt')) );
[04:46:40] <ramontayag> what do you mean? not familiar with 'plot' btw
[04:46:49] <johanhar> ramontayag: thanks, I tried to load jquery first, did not work .. I can click the link from source code so it is there.. hmm
[04:47:04] <monstermedo> Its chart addon : $.plot($('.list'), $('.list'.attr('alt') );
[04:47:06] <ramontayag> $.plot($('.list'), $('.list').attr('alt'))
[04:47:23] <ramontayag> or...
[04:47:30] <monstermedo> should work
[04:47:33] <monstermedo> I concur
[04:47:42] <ramontayag> var list = $('.list'); $plot(list, list.attr('alt'));
[04:47:47] <cerzi> hi all, im having a strange problem with changing the src attr of an img that is also being scaled by scaleImage plugin.. sometimes when the src changes, the width/height of the new img is that of the old one, stretching it out of proportion. other times, though, it works properly... bug with scaleImage?
[04:48:38] <cerzi> if it works properly it works fine until the page is refreshed
[04:48:41] <cerzi> then has a chance of bugging
[04:48:53] <ramontayag> johanhar, I suppose if you put an embedded script it works?
[04:49:51] <t432> error msg (missing ")" after condition) error on line 62 http://pastebin.com/euBGyeBf
[04:51:36] <johanhar> ramontayag: yes, it was just me, who wrote "jacatype" on type under script-tag
[04:51:38] <johanhar> durrrr
[04:51:40] <johanhar> :D
[04:51:51] <ramontayag> sorry I don't understand
[04:52:13] <johanhar> <script type="text/javascript"> ... instead I wrote jacascript
[04:53:05] <Peter`> The type attribute is not needed.
[04:53:17] <Peter`> It's perfectly fine to just use <script>
[04:55:55] <blamey> not according to w3
[04:57:40] <t432> any suggestions folks?
[04:57:51] <seutje> blamey: "The type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The charset parameter must not be specified. The default, which is used if the attribute is absent, is "text/javascript"."
[04:58:56] <Woet> t432: did you even read your own code?
[04:59:04] <seutje> forreal
[04:59:04] <blamey> I was sure it said that it was required... my bad
[04:59:07] <t432> its not my code
[04:59:08] <seutje> &amp; &amp;?
[04:59:12] <Woet> then read it
[04:59:13] <t432> i removed those
[04:59:19] <Woet> okay, then update the pastebin
[04:59:24] <t432> 1 sec
[04:59:29] <seutje> so there's no operator anymore?
[04:59:30] <phrearch> hi
[04:59:35] <Woet> seutje: probably :D
[04:59:41] <seutje> ?eval (true false)
[04:59:42] <bot-t> seutje: SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical
[04:59:46] <seutje> OMGLOOK
[04:59:51] <Woet> it looks just like it!
[04:59:52] <Peter`> blamey: It depends on the doctype you use. As long as you use <!doctype html>, you're good to go.
[04:59:59] <phrearch> i kinda simulated mousehold now, but is it also possible to get the actual mouse x/y with something like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403389/ ?
[05:00:06] <t432> http://pastebin.com/pzsGK75E
[05:00:14] <Woet> .. lol
[05:00:19] <Woet> t432: do you know basic javascript?
[05:00:20] <seutje> wow
[05:00:37] <t432> not really
[05:00:39] <seutje> ur suppose to replace those encoded thingies, not just remove them
[05:00:45] <t432> i am complete client side newbie
[05:00:55] <Woet> t432: so you're just copy pasting the code without any debugging of your own?
[05:00:55] <seutje> do u speak php?
[05:01:54] <seutje> t432: on line 62, replace the semicolons with douple ampersands
[05:03:33] <kostodo> anyone used .validate and ui.datepicker on the same page?
[05:03:37] <kostodo> it bugs out big time
[05:03:48] <kostodo> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[05:06:30] <kostodo> no one?
[05:06:38] <kostodo> so no one validates their fields?
[05:06:41] <kostodo> interesting!
[05:09:27] <yurio> Hmm, I've got ajax loaded content with links in it that i've added jquery events to, but when the new content is loaded the jquery events doesn't work. I've looked around and found the .trigger('update'); which people keep mentioning, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Here's my js http://jsfiddle.net/RSF43/
[05:09:32] <yurio> any help would be great =)
[05:09:35] <RobertX> Hi. This is what I am trying to do - http://pastebin.com/zBnXMRb0
[05:09:53] <RobertX> I want a div from the other page to be displayed. Is that possible?
[05:10:45] <Trisox> any one see erichynds?
[05:16:45] <StevenTyler> I love you all!
[05:18:13] <Skola> could anybody recommend me a site where I can purchase eBooks _with PayPal_ ?
[05:19:09] <RobertX> how should the vars from load() be read in php. either as $_GET or $_POST?
[05:19:40] <StevenTyler> PayPalsucks.com
[05:19:41] <yurio> RobertX, yes
[05:19:45] <toot> hey folks (i queried this on css also) - i'm replacing a cursor with a customer cursor (working fine in safari/chrome) but in Firefox 4 it only gets replaced the first time - subsequent changes - don't appear? FF4 http://dev.dotlabel.co.uk/botb/b/ - any hacky ideas welcome :D
[05:20:44] <mronoffon> hello everyone!
[05:21:24] <RobertX> ??
[05:21:38] <RobertX> yurio What do you mean by yes?
[05:22:16] <yurio> depending on your use of load you can use both
[05:22:40] <RobertX> I am passing a form variable to update to a database.
[05:22:47] <toot> it The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.
[05:22:47] <RobertX> Will both work?
[05:22:55] <mronoffon> this maybe be a widely asked question, but has anyone been able to successfully get 'select option' hover features working in ff, safari, etc?
[05:22:56] <toot> from the docs on load
[05:23:08] <blamey> skola: http://dearauthor.com/features/industry-news/all-romance-ebooks-accepts-paypal/
[05:23:53] <toot> RobertX - so as per the docs, post will be used if the data is passed as an object {foo:bar} otherwise if 'foo=bar' then get
[05:24:28] <RobertX> Thank you
[05:24:44] <toot> it's okay - i didn't know either :P just read the doc ;)
[05:25:38] <blamey> toot: that's a very distracting game...
[05:26:01] <lugzer> hi all
[05:27:05] <RobertX> load()  will replace the content in an element wont it?  Is there any other function what will add to the element
[05:27:16] <StevenTyler> append()?
[05:27:18] <blamey> toot: I'm using FF4 and it seems to be fine... ?
[05:28:28] <RobertX> But will append function like load()
[05:28:49] <RobertX> fetch data from a url?
[05:29:16] <Woet> RobertX: use .get and .load
[05:29:19] <Woet> and put .append into the callback
[05:30:31] <Woet> RobertX: $.get("/url/goes/here", function(data){ $("#result").append(data); });
[05:31:16] <lugzer> i use jquery-ui datepicker to set a date. how should i store picked date so that after it can be read by php? would that be hidden input field?
[05:31:40] <toot> hehe sorry about the game - good fun though :)
[05:31:49] <Ely^> .seen sean`
[05:31:49] <hsbot> sean` was seen 1 hour, 23 minutes and 44 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: lololololol
[05:31:52] <toot> blamey - can i ask - FF4 on PC/Mac/*Nix?
[05:32:01] <toot> i'm on FF4 on mac :)
[05:32:04] <blamey> toot: mac
[05:32:10] <toot> bugger :)
[05:32:13] <mronoffon> anyone?
[05:32:24] <kojiro> mronoffon: anyone what?
[05:32:50] <mronoffon> this maybe be a widely asked question, but has anyone been able to successfully get 'select option' hover features working in ff, safari, etc?
[05:32:53] <RobertX> posting the vars?
[05:33:02] <toot> to be fair i find google's homepage widget more distracting today - though i've been looking at these girls for weeks :)
[05:33:09] <kojiro> mronoffon: I'm unfamiliar with those features.
[05:33:56] <mronoffon> kojiro:  i'm just trying to 'hover' over the options of a 'select' widget
[05:34:30] <kojiro> mronoffon: ah, yeah, I could see how that would be an issue
[05:35:08] <toot> blamey - if i can be a pest. once you lock it - you get a red (locked lens) and a x-hair custom cursor. first time for me x-hair appears fine. once i move outside the bounding lens again (it goes green) - i then lock again and it's at that point the x-hair no longer appears (even though $('#element).css('cursor'); returns what i would expect.
[05:35:24] <mronoffon> it appears that none of the 'mouse' event do not work for option attributes in safari
[05:35:55] <mronoffon> kojiro: have  you tried this before?
[05:36:22] <kojiro> mronoffon: I think I may have, but not recently
[05:36:41] <mronoffon> kojiro: what was your solution?
[05:36:48] <RobertX> $.get("login.php", {user: name, pass: pwd}, function(data){ $("#result").append(data); });
[05:37:01] <RobertX> Is that correct?
[05:37:03] <Woet> RobertX: use .post instead of .get
[05:37:05] <Woet> if you want to post
[05:37:42] <RobertX> Is the above piece of code correct?
[05:37:48] <Woet> looks fine, yes
[05:37:52] <blamey> toot: ahhh right, now I get what you mean
[05:38:03] <kojiro> mronoffon: I probably didn't solve it. I mean, here's the thing: If you have few enough options for :hovering to be worthwhile, then you have few enough options that radiobuttons and checkboxes are a very fair alternative.
[05:38:10] <johanhar> Hi. In ajax-requests, how can I check if the "data" parameter given on success, is empty? Both as html and json as datatype. I tried stuff like "if (!data)" and "if(!data.length===0)" ..
[05:38:29] <Woet> johanhar: if (data === '')
[05:38:31] <Woet> ?
[05:38:39] <johanhar> Ok I'll try that, thanks
[05:39:10] <mronoffon> kojiro: well, it would be a 'list' of options
[05:39:19] <kojiro> wut
[05:39:40] <kojiro> mronoffon: surely you don't mean list in the HTML sense
[05:39:49] <mronoffon> kojirio: ..like filenames read from the server
[05:40:08] <mronoffon> kojiro: yes, i do.
[05:40:10] <kojiro> mronoffon: ok, but I don't understand what that has to do with it...
[05:40:13] <johanhar> Woet: that didnt work. "if (!data === '')" does not execute it's content, only the else, when the json and/or html got a response that is not empty
[05:40:32] <kojiro> mronoffon: <ul><li><option .../></li><li><option .../></li>...</ul>?
[05:40:54] <Woet> johanhar: what are you trying to do exactly?
[05:41:08] <Woet> if you want to turn it around
[05:41:13] <Woet> use: if(data !== ''){
[05:41:17] <johanhar> hmm
[05:41:18] <impi> hello, i am using jquery tools, scrollable with this config: http://pastebin.com/9UmzNNsg but for some reason my scrollable moves by 2..instead of the value given : size: 1,
[05:41:27] <Woet> and for JSON, if(data.length !== 0)
[05:41:28] <mronoffon> kojiro:  ok.  but i need this to work with the 'Select' component <select...>,,<option>...
[05:41:39] <impi> the live version is here: http://dev.micket.me/test/test.php#
[05:41:56] <johanhar> That worked Woet , thank you :)
[05:42:03] <Woet> yay!
[05:42:05] <kojiro> mronoffon: hang on a sec, I think we're getting our streams crossed...
[05:42:05] <johanhar> :D
[05:42:10] <sodapop> anyone know if the jquery ui components (accordion,tabs) conform to the WAI ARIA accessibility standards?
[05:42:33] <Woet> sodapop: yes.
[05:42:37] <kojiro> mronoffon: When you say "list ... in the html sense" I think <nav> <ul> <ol> <dl>...
[05:42:45] <kojiro> mronoffon: not <select>
[05:42:45] <Woet> sodapop: http://www.marcozehe.de/2009/03/07/jquery-ui-17-released/
[05:42:57] <kojiro> mronoffon: but afaik <ul><li><option... is wrong
[05:43:07] <kojiro> mronoffon: so you threw me for a loop
[05:43:25] <sodapop> Woet: do i have to write some extra code or it's supported natively?
[05:43:29] <mronoffon> kojiro:  i meant a list of <option>
[05:43:33] <Woet> sodapop: native
[05:43:37] <tehopeologist> hey guys, was wondering if someone could help me change an <a href=""> text when someone hovers over a <div>
[05:43:39] <sodapop> thanks woet
[05:43:47] <tehopeologist> i need to change the color of the <a>
[05:44:07] <tehopeologist> i've tried doing it via css
[05:44:11] <kojiro> mronoffon: be careful about that word "list". In Javascript you might want to say "an Array of options"
[05:44:16] <kojiro> mronoffon: so anyway...
[05:44:16] <tehopeologist> but it doesn't do it the way it should
[05:44:27] <tehopeologist> if you hover over just the div, the <a> doesn't change color
[05:44:32] <kojiro> mronoffon: why must it be a bunch of <option> elements?
[05:48:51] <yurio> Hmm, I've got ajax loaded content with links in it that i've added jquery events to, but when the new content is loaded the jquery events doesn't work. I've looked around and found the .trigger('update'); which people keep mentioning, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Here's my js http://jsfiddle.net/RSF43/

[05:52:20] <cerzi> is there a common reason for a modal dialog making the background page flick a few pixels to the side?
[05:52:57] <yurio> thanks =P
[05:55:13] <yurio> odd that i couldn't find that by googling, then again I should've checked the FAQ >_>
[05:59:51] <mronoffon> kojiro:  because i'm using a 'dropdown' widget from my framework which is converted to a 'Select' tag in html
[05:59:58] <kojiro> mronoffon: woof.
[06:00:14] <mronoffon> kojiro:  woof?
[06:00:21] <kojiro> mronoffon: "oof?"
[06:00:39] <kojiro> mronoffon: I don't know how to solve this with "real" selectbox menus
[06:01:13] <mronoffon> kojiro:  well, how would u 'fake it' without a lot of coding?
[06:03:28] <le_coeur> somebody knows a good mediawiki -> html convert in javascript?
[06:03:37] <kojiro> mronoffon: idk, try this? http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Forms-and-Controls-C-C/-SELECT--to--UL--convertor-68552.html
[06:04:39] <le_coeur> converter
[06:05:48] <Peter`> le_coeur: there is a whole range of reasons causing that to not make any sense at all
[06:06:16] <mronoffon> kojiro:  thanks for the link.  now reviewing code
[06:06:20] <Peter`> MediaWiki outputs HTML. It is HTML. Only the back-end (which doesn't matter for the output) has been written in PHP
[06:06:42] <alisalaah> is there a jquery player that will allow me to run javascript at points in the audio file
[06:06:48] <le_coeur> mediwiki markup
[06:06:58] <alisalaah> like bind an event to happen at 0:09 seconds, 1:30, etc
[06:07:05] <impi> alisalaah, try longtail
[06:07:25] <le_coeur> mediawiki markup is not html
[06:08:09] <simplestick> le_coeur: show us an example of the markup you're trying to convert.
[06:08:30] <alisalaah> Generally advice, I'm making an online book with png files, then audio that reads the book, and then events at timed points in the audio that will highlight the words being read.  So will doing png files, with mp3's + an xml with the time points in it + longtail be the best way?
[06:08:48] <le_coeur> http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting
[06:09:00] <le_coeur> this is mediawiki markup
[06:10:30] <alisalaah> I will also ideally be hiding the audio player and having custom controls for skipping to c=pages, chapters, etc
[06:16:01] <redex> Hello. I use $('.radiobutton').change(function() and check if attibute is checked to triger. How do i triger something if radio uncheks?
[06:16:54] <tomek_> hi i have
[06:16:57] <tomek_> a question
[06:17:06] <tomek_> why when
[06:17:17] <tomek_> i creating empty object jQuery([])
[06:17:35] <tomek_> and try to add other filed to the set of matched elements
[06:17:52] <tomek_> my []
[06:17:57] <tomek_> is still empty
[06:18:09] <tomek_> ?
[06:18:12] <bot-t> tomek_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[06:18:46] <tomek_> anyone can help
[06:18:50] <tomek_> im just curious
[06:19:00] <ajpiano> you have to show your code
[06:19:06] <ajpiano> you probably are just doing something wrong
[06:19:40] <tomek_> jQuery([]).add("input[name='something']")
[06:19:55] <tomek_> and the when i run console.log
[06:20:01] <ajpiano> you don't have to do $([]) to make an empty jquery
[06:20:04] <tomek_> my object
[06:20:07] <ajpiano> you can just do $()
[06:20:08] <tomek_> i know
[06:20:10] <phrearch> i have a simple inline image resizer for a contenteditable, but with more than one image, it seems to operate on all images at once. any idea what could be wrong? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403428/
[06:20:11] <ajpiano> what are you console logging?
[06:20:12] <tomek_> from jq 1.4
[06:20:32] <tomek_> firebug
[06:20:43] <ajpiano> no
[06:20:45] <ajpiano> what variable.
[06:20:48] <ajpiano> duh.
[06:21:00] <tomek_> var $somethjig = jQuery();
[06:21:04] <bobbobbins> speaking of doing something wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/8UJeB/1/ I have an each loop there that I can't get to work right, can someone take a look?
[06:21:11] <tomek_> i store it in some variable
[06:21:17] <poppiez> is it possible to position the jquery datepicker plugin to the right of the input field rather than under it?
[06:21:18] <ajpiano> tomek_: .add doesn't modify the original set
[06:21:21] <ajpiano> it creates a new one
[06:21:29] <ajpiano> it's not like push
[06:21:38] <tomek_> mm
[06:21:39] <tomek_> hmm
[06:21:59] <tomek_> but hmm
[06:22:00] <ajpiano> you have to update the variable with every add
[06:22:08] <ajpiano> var foo = $();  foo = foo.add("watever");
[06:22:13] <tomek_> yup
[06:22:31] <AdvoWork> i do: $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );  to open my dialog, but "close" and "destroy" wont close it down, the X(cross) closes it though. Any ideas please?
[06:22:45] <tomek_> ajpiano
[06:22:54] <tomek_> but its exacly what i do
[06:22:59] <tomek_> your snippet
[06:23:05] <ajpiano> ok
[06:23:10] <bobbobbins> so in my script, in my each...i pass "this" which is a div to another method to alter the html...but when i go to call .html it says it isn't a function
[06:23:11] <ajpiano> well show some failing code in jsfiddle.net or something
[06:23:16] <ajpiano> i'm not going to sit here any play guessing games
[06:23:50] <tomek_> ok
[06:24:14] <tomek_> i just remove it and add to jq wrapper
[06:24:16] <tomek_> selector
[06:24:24] <tomek_> but what od u mean
[06:24:26] <tomek_> update
[06:24:37] <tomek_> i thought it works like a push
[06:24:42] <erichynds> loool
[06:24:45] <ajpiano> i just said it *doesn't* work like push
[06:24:49] <tomek_> i mean i add something to set of matched elements
[06:24:58] <tomek_> i know
[06:24:59] <bobbobbins> i did: http://jsfiddle.net/8UJeB/1/
[06:25:21] <tomek_> so how does it work
[06:25:34] <ajpiano> it creates a new set.
[06:25:48] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: you're calling the functions in the context of 'this' which is a dom element, not a jquery object.
[06:25:56] <tomek_> and what is happens with old one ?
[06:26:09] <ajpiano> nothing
[06:26:11] <ajpiano> happens to it.
[06:26:18] <bobbobbins> ajpiano, but in the variation1 method, when i do a console.log, it says that 'this' is a div
[06:26:24] <ajpiano> it is
[06:26:25] <tomek_> so u operatne only on a new set
[06:26:27] <bobbobbins> oh
[06:26:32] <ajpiano> ...
[06:26:34] <ajpiano> lol
[06:26:35] <ajpiano> :)
[06:26:36] <bobbobbins> i see
[06:26:40] <bobbobbins> so how do i fix that?
[06:26:40] <tomek_> ?
[06:26:42] <erichynds> tomek_
[06:26:44] <erichynds> [09:22:00] <ajpiano> you have to update the variable with every add
[06:26:44] <erichynds> [09:22:08] <ajpiano> var foo = $(); Â foo = foo.add("watever");
[06:27:17] <erichynds> .add() returns a new set that you assign back to foo.
[06:27:19] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: apply($(that).arguments);
[06:27:29] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: apply($(that), arguments);
[06:27:41] <bobbobbins> ajpiano, lemmie try that
[06:28:10] <tomek_> but it merge it
[06:28:24] <tomek_> it merge old variable with new varialbe
[06:28:28] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: hah, that worked...i get it now...i think
[06:28:29] <erichynds> false
[06:28:29] <tomek_> added by add() method
[06:28:42] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: what you should really do is var $this = $(this);  if ($this.hasClass("variation1")) { somefunc.apply($this);   }
[06:28:52] <ajpiano> so that you don't create jquery object from the same dom element multiple times for no reason
[06:29:07] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: ok, i'll do that, the this stuff gets me all confused
[06:29:09] <erichynds> what are you expecting to happen, tomek_? add() ADDS new elements to your collection, and returns the entire thing
[06:29:35] <tomek_> that i was expecting
[06:29:40] <tomek_> but it doesnt work
[06:29:42] <tomek_> right
[06:29:49] <tomek_> as i said
[06:30:02] <tomek_> var $something= jQuery();
[06:30:08] <erichynds> i bet i can get it to work
[06:30:17] <tomek_> $somethig.add(".selector")
[06:30:29] <tomek_> and after that my object is empoty
[06:30:31] <tomek_> empty
[06:30:33] <erichynds> $something = $something.add(".selector")
[06:30:56] <erichynds> $something will remain $something until you assign the result of method back to it.
[06:31:02] <erichynds> in this case, an empty obj
[06:31:03] <tomek_> oh i get
[06:31:06] <tomek_> it now
[06:31:11] <erichynds> add is not mutative
[06:31:21] <ajpiano> are you sure you don't want to ask the question again and have us give the same answer one more time :)
[06:31:35] <tomek_> im sure
[06:31:36] <tomek_> ;p
[06:31:51] <tomek_> thanks
[06:32:04] <AdvoWork> i do: $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );  to open my dialog, but "close" and "destroy" wont close it down, the X(cross) closes it though. Any ideas please?
[06:32:22] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: please make a live demo if you want help, hard to guess what's going wrong from just that description
[06:33:02] <seutje> ajpiano: what? ur not clarevoyant?
[06:33:20] <alisalaah> Generally advice, I'm making an online book with png files, then audio that reads the book, and then events at timed points in the audio that will highlight the words being read.  So will doing png files, with mp3's + an xml with the time points in it + longtail or another js audio player be the best way?  I want to have my own controls to skip the audio and png's and highlighting to any chapter, or section at will and controls to loop sections etc...
[06:33:33] <ajpiano> seutje: not by default :p
[06:33:46] <seutje> ajpiano: heh, only on weekends?
[06:33:48] <alisalaah> It's not standard text so i can't just use text, it has to be png's
[06:34:11] <ajpiano> huh
[06:34:19] <seutje> when u become adamina
[06:34:21] <ajpiano> what isn't "standard" about the text alisalaah ?
[06:34:29] <ajpiano> seutje: yup !!
[06:35:04] <ajpiano> using pngs to present book content sounds like something the failwhale came up with himself :/
[06:35:40] <ajpiano> alisalaah: have you seen popcorn.js ?  it might be quite appropriate for what you're trying to do and like, let you not use pngs
[06:35:41] <ajpiano> http://popcornjs.org/
[06:36:04] <ajpiano> works to add annotations to audio or video
[06:37:30] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, im struggling to make a demo, tried to use jsfiddle, i cant link to my internal site
[06:38:25] <seutje> weird, isn't it?
[06:38:40] <alisalaah> ajpiano, the book is being given to me in a scanned version for 1, and it is a book with a lot of built in artwork and non text elements that i wouldn't want to reproduce in html for all 800 pages
[06:38:58] <ajpiano> cool
[06:39:18] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/8UJeB/2/ I did what you said and changed it to $this, but i have a question....how come at the beginning i do a that=this and that works, but in the each i have to use $(this)
[06:39:27] <ajpiano> well most people typically are interested in web experiences that are centered around making the developers life easier, rather than creating immersive, web-friendly, shareable experiences
[06:39:28] <ajpiano> sooo
[06:39:34] <ajpiano> you are probably on the right track.
[06:39:53] <ajpiano> who doesn't want to just download 800 high res pngs!
[06:40:29] <elb0w`> is this correct?
[06:40:33] <elb0w`> ugh
[06:40:36] <elb0w`> copy paste ftl :(
[06:41:26] <elb0w`> $("#somediv").contents().find("iframe[name='blah']).contents().find("select").each(....)
[06:41:35] <elb0w`> Im curious about the find("select").each part
[06:41:37] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: because in the beginning of a $.fn.foo = function() { } ,  'this' is a jQuery object, whereas inside of the each, 'this' is a simple DOM eleent
[06:42:16] <bobbobbins> hmm...interesting...and confusing...but now i think i got it
[06:43:40] <OldCode101> has anyone been able to get a getJSON request to work against Yahoo or Google Web Services?
[06:45:22] <ajpiano> OldCode101: you have to make your request using jsonp

[06:45:50] <OldCode101> ajpiano, thanks
[06:49:10] <alisalaah> ajpiano, the pngs are loaded two at a time for the pages... i saw a similar thing done in flash for this book but that is no longer available so im recreating it
[06:49:24] <wookie> site is down! :(
[06:50:14] <ajpiano> wookie:  oh no :(
[06:50:53] <ajpiano> i'll have someone look into it
[06:50:58] <ajpiano> in the meantime i thiink you can use jqapi.com
[06:52:07] <elb0w`> http://pastie.org/2042728
[06:52:15] <elb0w`> This doesnt seem to work, any ideas?
[06:52:21] <nVee> What would be the best way to dynamically change content based on an ajax call true or false. I have gotten to the stage that my php script returns the desired results, and based on true or false it will show entirely different content, but because its not just 1 or 2 lines, but includes a register form ect, html() wont work, what else can I do?
[06:52:37] <nVee> yeah the api server is currently down
[06:53:26] <ajpiano> nVee, you should return json so you can have the true false property in there as well as strings of html and any other properties you may need
[06:55:58] <elb0w`> http://pastie.org/2042728 anyone have any input?
[06:56:08] <seutje> elb0w`: prolly being called before the iframe is done loading
[06:57:21] <flashingpumpkin> hey guys. i need to fire a function every time a new element with a certain class is added to the DOM - livequery does that nicely, but i was wondering if there's jquery native ways to do it (was first thinking of .live)
[06:57:29] <nVee> ajpiano: I am returning json, that isnt really the problem at the moment
[06:57:40] <nVee> my problem is more the output of content after that
[06:58:00] <heatxsink> ugh i'm experiencing the worst jquery-ui sortable bug ever!
[06:58:06] <flashingpumpkin> also, livequery has not seen any commits since feb 2010
[06:58:24] <nVee> I am, based on the outcome of my php json script, using html() for a div to depend what content needs to be shown (either output errors or show another form)
[06:58:45] <nVee> the problem is the form fields are excessively long and it feels like bad practise to use html() to output an entire form ect
[06:58:57] <nVee> It will work I guess, but I was hoping there was an easier way of doing it
[06:59:25] <ajpiano> what about it feels like bad practise, i mean, what else would you do besides html to insert strings of html
[07:00:02] <elb0w`> seutje: no its fired onload
[07:00:12] <elb0w`> How do I find <select ?
[07:00:43] <Deele> elb0w` $('select')
[07:00:44] <impi> hey guys, can you please give me ahint why my scrollable scrolls 2 items instead of just one? http://dev.micket.me/test/test.php#
[07:00:51] <elb0w`> odd, it didnt seem to work hmm
[07:00:57] <heatxsink> the update event keeps getting called twice
[07:01:02] <impi> when i scroll next, it scrolls by two, when i click previous it scrolls by one...
[07:01:07] <impi> and i cant figure out why
[07:01:13] <nVee> ajpiano: I just mean if I was to write the HTML it would take accross about 20 - 30 lines, now im doing it all in a single .html()
[07:01:15] <nVee> that feels wrong :P
[07:01:29] <nVee> sorry, i am very new to jquery as you can pick up :)
[07:01:37] <ajpiano> um yeah, that feels right.
[07:01:45] <nVee> hahaha okay okay :)
[07:01:48] <ajpiano> you are supposed to insert the largest string of html possible.
[07:01:49] <nVee> no winning i guess :P
[07:01:56] <ajpiano> not like, write lots of html
[07:02:01] <seutje> elb0w`: http://jsbin.com/edipe5/2/edit seems to work for me

[07:08:09] <Rost> Hi is it possible with jquery/javascript to 'shuffle' a list? so that its always random what item is the first?
[07:09:17] <ajpiano> ?lmgtfy javascript array shuffle
[07:09:17] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+array+shuffle
[07:18:35] <tomek_> why when i get val() from one field and copy it to another $sometnig.val(newvalue)
[07:18:51] <erichynds> wat
[07:19:08] <tomek_> i see it normally,but phisical i cant see ii
[07:19:13] <tomek_> in the html
[07:19:23] <tomek_> im using firebug
[07:19:23] <erichynds> you won't see it in a view source
[07:19:33] <tomek_> why ?
[07:19:41] <erichynds> you're not seeing it in firebug's html tab?
[07:19:46] <tomek_> yup
[07:19:56] <tomek_> its strange
[07:20:09] <erichynds> that happens to me once in a while.
[07:20:16] <erichynds> firebug can be buggy
[07:20:27] <tomek_> maybe
[07:20:32] <systemfault> Switch to chrome ;)
[07:20:55] <tomek_> chrome is faster, but i prefer firebug
[07:21:24] <ajpiano> setting val does not set the value attribute in the html
[07:21:28] <ajpiano> it sets the value property
[07:21:48] <tomek_> i dont agree
[07:22:02] <systemfault> What?
[07:22:03] <tomek_> i switch to attr("value",somethig)
[07:22:05] <tomek_> and
[07:22:20] <tomek_> there is no difference
[07:22:31] <tomek_> val() is just a shortcut
[07:22:39] <ajpiano> to setting the property
[07:22:40] <tomek_> an alias i think
[07:22:46] <ajpiano> which version of jquery are you using btw
[07:23:07] <tomek_> 1.4.4
[07:23:23] <ajpiano> .val is more than just a shortcut to attr
[07:23:37] <ajpiano> and in both cases, they set the DOM element property, not the actual physical html attr
[07:23:46] <ajpiano> you could have better results if you switch to 1.6.1
[07:24:15] <tomek_> thats what i thioughtr
[07:24:21] <tomek_> i should update
[07:24:30] <tomek_> my jq lib
[07:24:47] <tomek_> but how to set some attr phisical ?
[07:24:52] <tomek_> prop?
[07:25:17] <ajpiano> .attr
[07:25:17] <ajpiano> :p
[07:26:27] <tomek_> no
[07:26:31] <tomek_> it wont work
[07:26:55] <systemfault> .attr is magical in older versions of jQuery.. AFAIK
[07:27:14] <systemfault> It checks/does a few different things.
[07:27:30] <systemfault> That's why they separated it in 1.6.x
[07:27:34] <systemfault> attr/prop
[07:28:27] <chiisana> $("#log-area") is null  <-- I get this even though I have a <div id="log-area"></div> in my code.... does firefox hate me, or am I missing something extremely basic?
[07:28:56] <systemfault> Probably missing something.
[07:29:04] <systemfault> You got the good syntax.
[07:29:10] <erichynds> jquery never returns null. is there another lib on the page, chiisana?
[07:29:13] <vasocreta> hey everyone. I have one last hurdle to get over before finishing a site build and I am at a loss. I use a jquery plugin that centers and image in its container. It works perfectly on dev. BUt on test (http://annejoyce.mvwtechnology.com/index.php) it works on the first image but not on subsequent images. Any ideas??
[07:29:15] <cesconix> can i get the content of div of an external page with $.load() ?
[07:29:20] <oal> What js templating engines do you use? I find jquery.tmpl rather limiting, so I'm looking for something more feature rich.
[07:29:44] <chiisana> I have scripty2 loaded (in hopes to do some multi touch manipulation), let me try removing that
[07:30:07] <chiisana> aha! that was it, thanks!
[07:30:18] <vasocreta> cesconix: you want the content from a specific div from another page?
[07:31:00] <erichynds> chiisana: you may want to explore jQuery's noConflict mode
[07:31:07] <cesconix> vasocreta, yes
[07:31:13] <vasocreta> hmmm
[07:31:47] <systemfault> cesconix: The page is on the same domain?
[07:31:55] <cesconix> systemfault, yes
[07:31:56] <chiisana> erichynds: I'm not committed to scripty2 just yet, maybe I can poke around on jqueryui 's multitouch too :)
[07:32:40] <systemfault> cesconix: I'd probably use ajax and not load for that.
[07:33:14] <systemfault> cesconix: That way, you should be able to modify that html before including it in the DOM
[07:33:15] <cesconix> mh
[07:33:38] <systemfault> Ah!
[07:33:45] <systemfault> I'm wrong :D
[07:33:53] <vasocreta> cesconix: try this: $('#yourContainer').load('file/to/load #targetDiv');
[07:34:03] <systemfault> Like vasocreta said :)
[07:34:18] <cesconix> vasocreta, è quello che ho scritto prima senza '*'
[07:34:24] <cesconix> oOps
[07:34:34] <systemfault> cesconix: Language switch fail :/
[07:34:41] <cesconix> lol
[07:34:55] <vasocreta> no Ã¨ una probema! Io parlo un po d'Italiano!
[07:35:03] <vasocreta> hehe
[07:35:05] <cesconix> vasocreta, lol
[07:35:10] <cesconix> dont work!
[07:35:19] <vasocreta> it doesn't???
[07:35:25] <cesconix> load all content of page
[07:35:32] <vasocreta> it should. grrr
[07:35:36] <cesconix> gh
[07:35:55] <vasocreta> wait....the div you are trying to get the content FROM...does it have an ID or just a class?
[07:36:17] <cesconix> ID
[07:36:34] <vasocreta> cesconix: ok.
[07:37:01] <vasocreta> cesconix: try being more explicit with the target. Maybe div#divID
[07:37:43] <vasocreta> cesconix: I will admit, I have found .load() to be unreliable sometimes.
[07:37:50] <niftylettuce> anyone know of good on/off toggle switches? similar to iphone but with a jquery slider?
[07:37:52] <AdvoWork> if ive got a function, and am passing 10 params, whats the quickest way to check that each of them params is not null, and if so do something, or is it just easier doing a: if(param1 == undefined .... ?
[07:38:13] <GeO> hey
[07:39:09] <GeO> I'm using a $.ajax call (in POST) with json datatype, and I put the result into a dialog();
[07:39:09] <adac> Using ruby on rails I'm trying to replace a selectbox content, but somehow the content doesn't be replaced, seems that js(jquery) is not being executed: http://pastie.org/2041845 Any ideas?
[07:39:13] <vasocreta> AdvoWork: you can maybe put the params in an array and then just check to see if any of the values of the array are ==undefined
[07:39:24] <GeO> it works perfectly except on IE where the dialog pops twice, one normal and one empty
[07:39:32] <cesconix> $('#modal').load('servicios.html div#serv1', function(html){console.log(html);}); <--- print all <html>
[07:40:33] <GeO> anyone encountered the same bug?
[07:41:00] <Kingsy> alright ppl, I was on a site the other day, I cant remember the URL, but the background when you moved the mouse over it started to draw really cool wavey lines over it.. does anyone know of a plugin that sounds like that?
[07:41:09] <Kingsy> sorry I know I am probably not being very descriptive
[07:41:39] <ajpiano> Kingsy, were you on paulirish.com
[07:41:43] <vasocreta> cesconix: I am trying to figure out why what you have does not work.
[07:42:14] <Kingsy> ajpiano: ahha yeah I was that was it.. thats a really cool plugin
[07:42:22] <Kingsy> is that custom? or freely available?
[07:42:23] <_dave_h_d> hi all, does jquery animate use hardware acceleration where available?
[07:42:49] <Kingsy> ajpiano: or are there loads of different plugins that do similar things?
[07:43:13] <paul_irish> just one! just one in the world.
[07:43:50] <Kingsy> haha, and the man himself
[07:43:52] <paul_irish> http://paulirish.com/2010/my-harmonious-background-canvas/
[07:43:56] <Kingsy> nice plugin man, I like it
[07:43:59] <paul_irish> look for the github link
[07:44:06] <paul_irish> :){
[07:45:05] <Kingsy> cool thanks
[07:45:59] <freebsd_fan> in $.ajax, how to prevent it from aborting previous request?
[07:46:13] <freebsd_fan> mode: 'queue'?
[07:46:44] <vasocreta> :-| |
[07:47:13] <vasocreta> cesconix: I am not sure why that is not working for you.
[07:47:23] <cesconix> paul_irish, O.O ? you are Paul Irish!?
[07:47:23] <_dave_h_d> there seems to be a way of utilizing hardware acceleration: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-animate-enhanced unless this is too old?
[07:47:24] <cesconix> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
[07:47:44] <kojiro> I am kojiro
[07:47:45] <kojiro> :(
[07:47:46] <vasocreta> cesconix: did you find the solution?
[07:48:02] <cesconix> i'm your fan!
[07:48:03] <cesconix> kojiro, lol
[07:48:04] <cesconix> vasocreta,
[07:48:07] <cesconix> no
[07:48:08] <cesconix> :\
[07:48:12] <vasocreta> frak!
[07:48:30] <vasocreta> and my problem still remains unsolved too. What a crappy morning.
[07:49:06] <paul_irish> cesconix: SUPPPPPPP
[07:49:31] <cesconix> sup?
[07:50:55] <vasocreta> cesconix: what's up = sup
[07:51:59] <cesconix> thanks vasocreta
[07:52:47] <vasocreta> ok...so anyone else having issues with the timing of scripts being loaded on the page? I am about to put my head through a wall.
[07:53:09] <vasocreta> brb
[07:53:42] <GeO> I made some researches about my problem, some are reporting it when they got <script> in return, but I don't have any !
[07:54:12] <seutje> why were browsers ever given a print function? q.q
[07:56:19] <pngl> Is there an callback available for just after the response has been received (but not processed) -- apart from dataFilter.
[07:58:10] <paul_irish> seutje: to PRINT with
[07:58:39] <cesconix> vasocreta, solved!
[07:59:31] <vasocreta> cesconix: what was the solution??
[07:59:44] <cesconix> $.load('asd.htm', function(fantasticHtml) { $(fantasticHtml).find('#myID'); }); <--- !!!
[08:00:31] <seutje> bot-t: tell paul_irish BUT THEY SHOULDN'T!!!!11one
[08:00:32] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[08:01:09] <vasocreta> for real?? that is odd. It kind of makes sense, but really a wonky solution. jQuery does have some weird aspects, I must admit
[08:02:51] <cesconix> already. I thought that 'fantasticHtml' it was a string and not a jquery object!
[08:03:04] <cesconix> vasocreta, :\
[08:03:54] <Altreus> What's the reasoning behind jQuery's decision to make the `this` pointer refer to the DOM element, rather than the original jQuery object, in event handlers?
[08:04:19] <Altreus> given that most uses will probably want the jQuery object, and the DOM element is easily accessible with [0] anyway ...
[08:04:30] <Altreus> seems wasteful to require all those $(this) all over the place
[08:05:53] <vasocreta> Altreus: that is standard practice in js, I believe. The $(this) refers to whatever is the target of the function.
[08:06:42] <Altreus> ah, so it's older than jquery
[08:06:49] <vasocreta> indeed.
[08:07:09] <Altreus> fair enoughski
[08:07:50] <dragoonis> window.onbeforeunload() kicks in on IE8, but not on chrome/ff/safari.
[08:07:57] <dragoonis> onclick="window.onbeforeunload = null;javscript:backToTask({taskId});"
[08:08:20] <dragoonis> its being set to null currently, which IE doesn't like - is there a more cross-browser compliant way of disabling any current onbeforeunload callbacks ?
[08:09:00] <seutje> hehe "javscript"
[08:09:03] <ajpiano> dragoonis, you could bind and unbind the onbeforeunload with jquery?
[08:09:17] <dragoonis> the current implementation is raw JS unfortunately.
[08:09:22] <shichuan> is there any fun facts about jquery?
[08:09:23] <vasocreta> Altreus: example: <a href="sometaget" onclick=someFunction(this);...
[08:09:26] <dragoonis> ajpiano: i'm just making a quick bug fix - not reimplemnting stuff.

[08:09:54] <ajpiano> dragoonis, you could try setting it to an empty function instead of null
[08:10:01] <dragoonis> yes, onbeforeunload = function() {}
[08:10:02] <dragoonis> yes ?
[08:10:39] <ajpiano> ya
[08:11:07] <Altreus> vasocreta: ah you're right, JS's own event functions do that
[08:11:17] <Altreus> so this would make it compatible with existing event handlers
[08:11:23] <vasocreta> excatly
[08:11:43] <vasocreta> don mind my dyslexia
[08:13:16] <dragoonis> ajpiano: no that still kicks in :(
[08:14:39] <dragoonis> jQuery is availalable on the page ajpiano but the onbeforeunload is being set outside of JQ and i can't change that amt.
[08:14:43] <dragoonis> amt = atm. *
[08:14:51] <dragoonis> < Dr4g btw - i can't change my nick, not sure why
[08:15:13] <tehopeologist> so #css is dead or asleep, so i'll ask #jQuery
[08:15:29] <tehopeologist> can anyone explain to me why my mailchimp container in safari looks broken, but in firefox it's fine??  what can i do to make it look like firefox's version?  http://www.xecorporation.net/newvision/who-we-are
[08:15:29] <tehopeologist> it's on the sidebar
[08:17:41] <tehopeologist> anyone?

[08:18:55] <Ely^> where is that punk!
[08:22:08] <dragoonis> ajpiano: the following code is a setter.. (window).beforeunload(function() { ... });
[08:22:25] <freeed> tehopeologist, looks like you need to set a height on the container.. becasue your image is a background image it does not force the container height.. so the only 'height' is being created by the actual form fields
[08:22:30] <dragoonis> you mentioned 'unbind' before, did you mean jQuery.unbind() or just setting .beforeunload() to a blank anon func ?
[08:23:12] <freeed> tehopeologist, probably on #signupbg
[08:23:43] <ajpiano> imeant using unbind, but just try it, it might be dodgy
[08:23:49] <impi> hello, i have asked this question many times today, and have googled x50 as much...but my scrollable here scrolls x2 i need it to scroll x1..........can someone please, pretty please just freakin help me?
[08:24:06] <tehopeologist> ok thanks freeed i'll try that
[08:24:08] <impi> my script is here http://dev.micket.me/test/test.php
[08:24:39] <impi> previous works fine...next scrolls by x2 and i dont know why....
[08:27:36] <tehopeologist> freeed is there a firebug-like thing for safari?
[08:28:58] <ravenzz> tehopeologist the developers tools
[08:29:19] <tehopeologist> hm
[08:29:32] <ravenzz> are included into both chrome and safari
[08:29:34] <ryanneuf_> tehopeologist: aslo firebug lite
[08:30:19] <ravenzz> i suppose that the devtools are good enought
[08:30:47] <ryanneuf_> yeah, I'd go for the devtools myself
[08:30:54] <ryanneuf_> you have to enable them in the prefs
[08:31:04] <ravenzz> i don't think so
[08:31:09] <ryanneuf_> yes, you do
[08:31:12] <ryanneuf_> on a mac
[08:31:20] <ryanneuf_> otherwise they aren't there
[08:31:24] <NateDawg> hey does anyone know of any decent tutorials for jquery, uploadify and jcrop
[08:31:28] <tehopeologist> how do you enable them?
[08:31:49] <impi> can i just check if im on a fucking mute here ?
[08:31:52] <impi> jesus fucking H
[08:32:28] <ajpiano> impi: you are not on mute, no one has been able to help with your issue
[08:32:38] <impi> phew
[08:32:41] <ajpiano> i took a quick look but couldn't discern anything obvious but i am quite busy to dig in further
[08:32:46] <impi> thanks for that :(
[08:32:51] <ravenzz> i havent seen the question
[08:32:51] <ryanneuf_> tehopeologist: in preferences under the advanced tab
[08:33:16] <ryanneuf_> tehopeologist: there is a box "Show develop menu"
[08:33:18] <impi> no worries, i dont demand help but i have been patiently asking like an idiot the whole day..
[08:33:23] <ryanneuf_> or something like that
[08:33:34] <ravenzz> impi reask :o
[08:34:00] <ajpiano> impi: it could have something to do with the fact that you are re-initialing jscrollpane any time any ".event" is hovered
[08:34:02] <tehopeologist> i just installed firebug lite in the extensions
[08:34:05] <tehopeologist> gonna see if it works
[08:34:17] <adac> how to set to fire a function onload and onchange?
[08:35:22] <ryanneuf_> wat
[08:36:15] <tehopeologist> firebug lite ftw
[08:36:17] <impi> ill remove that scrollable, thanks for that, and i am cleaning the next/prev links - thanks for the tips
[08:36:22] <tehopeologist> weird thing is with that box
[08:36:23] <impi> arg the jscrollpane
[08:36:28] <dragoonis> hey guys - this doesn't seem to kick in with IE8 ?? $(window).unbind('beforeunload');
[08:36:30] <tehopeologist> why in the eff is it pushing down so far?
[08:36:35] <Misiur> Anybody know jCanvas here?
[08:36:48] <tehopeologist> like it IS noticing the 412px like the background image
[08:36:56] <tehopeologist> but the image just doesn't start till the fields start
[08:36:58] <tehopeologist> makes no sense..
[08:37:02] <tehopeologist> anyone have an idea?

[08:40:24] <adac> this is my code: http://pastie.org/2043191 it fires when #my-server changes. now i wanted this code to beexecutes also initially when the page is loaded. any ideas how to do that?

[08:49:03] <norbi> hi guys
[08:49:10] <norbi> is there a way to print with jquery
[08:49:20] <norbi> and take in consideration images
[08:49:24] <wib> toggle window.print event?
[08:49:30] <norbi> and absolute positions of them
[08:49:57] <norbi> for example i have 2 <img> with position absolutie top: 0; left: 0;
[08:50:08] <norbi> and one of them has z-index: 1
[08:50:09] <norbi> and 2
[08:50:16] <norbi> can i print that?
[08:50:29] <norbi> in the same way to apear on the page?
[08:51:04] <norbi> and i want to print just a part of the page
[08:51:17] <seutje> just hide the rest then
[08:51:58] <luxigo> norbi: you can use jquery.printElement.js
[08:52:00] <ravenzz> what you need is another css files as media="print"
[08:52:06] <seutje> sprinkle some noPrint classes around and go all display: none on them in ur print css
[08:52:48] <ravenzz> norbi <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="print.css" />
[08:53:05] <ravenzz> then you can hide/show place whatever you want
[08:53:52] <luxigo> printing is very tricky... with very long tables i have problem with chrome (line not the same length or overlapping) but it works with firefox..
[08:54:06] <luxigo> same height i mean
[08:54:19] <dorgan> ok maybe I am approaching this the wrong way....Currently I have a link that have a live click event on it....I am adding a second click event but I need to hold off on executing the live clikc event and then fire it at a later time...what is the best way to do that?
[08:54:49] <luxigo> and with many small tables i have problems with tables missing or cut between pages (althoug i try to use page-break related css rules)
[08:55:07] <norbi> it is interesting
[08:55:11] <norbi> http://projects.erikzaadi.com/jQueryPlugins/jQuery.printElement/
[08:55:16] <norbi> im looking at this
[08:55:58] <impi> weird..
[08:56:03] <janthony> success: function(data){  - How do I set the data in my php to be returned to the jquery $.ajax()?
[08:56:04] <luxigo> its usefull when you have many frames in divs and want to print only one div
[08:56:07] <impi> i think it's the next/previous link.
[08:56:53] <norbi> but for example <img src=Â¨myimage1.jpgÂ¨ style=Â¨position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;Â¨ width=Â¨300Â¨ height=Â¨200Â¨ /><img src=Â¨myimage2.jpgÂ¨ style=Â¨position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;Â¨ width=Â¨100Â¨ height=Â¨50Â¨/>
[08:57:05] <norbi> will not appear on each other on the page
[08:57:05] <janthony> er, echo'ing seems to work, but what if I only want to return multiple items from my php file? can I do like data.somephpvar?
[08:57:13] <norbi> they will be under each other
[08:57:31] <luxigo> i dont know... anyway use classes dans css instead of attribute style=...
[08:57:44] <luxigo> so that you can use a css for screen an one for printing
[08:58:05] <norbi> yes, im using css, i wrote this just for demonstration
[08:58:32] <luxigo> you can set opacity
[08:58:33] <impi> yes it is.
[08:58:46] <luxigo> or z-index
[08:58:47] <impi> stupid next previous links.
[08:59:10] <norbi> i have z-index
[08:59:20] <norbi> but it drops down each other
[08:59:39] <luxigo> ?
[08:59:42] <norbi> the second img will be at top: 200px instead of top 0px
[08:59:53] <seutje> reason 789597857945 not to use inline styles q.q
[08:59:55] <norbi> no mather what i do
[09:00:11] <luxigo> try with another browser..
[09:00:16] <seutje> img { position: static !important; }
[09:00:25] <seutje> won't work in oldIEs though
[09:00:53] <norbi> so inline style is a problem, and position: stati?
[09:00:56] <norbi> not absolute?
[09:01:00] <jedimind_> position: static works just fine in every IE version as far back as IE3
[09:01:06] <jedimind_> i think you're thinking of position: fixed;
[09:01:09] <seutje> really?
[09:01:21] <jedimind_> static position is what every element is by default
[09:01:25] <seutje> u sure I wasn't referring to the !important ?
[09:01:33] <jedimind_> nope
[09:01:36] <jedimind_> im not sure about anything
[09:01:39] <seutje> thanks for the lesson in obviousness though
[09:01:53] <jedimind_> and !important goes as far back as IE4 iirc

[09:10:38] <jedimind_> seutje, yeah it's a bug, that doesnt mean it's not supported, if you just do width: auto !important; and not have anything else inside the same declaration, it's fine
[09:10:39] <jedimind_> anyway
[09:11:06] <seutje> it doesn't recognize !important, hence it's not supported

[09:17:59] <sorens3n> mmm
[09:18:42] <sorens3n> for example

[09:19:17] <mbutubuntu> sorens3n, I need a complete list of keyCode
[09:19:24] <sorens3n> google away
[09:19:26] <mbutubuntu> so what code has for example CTRL?
[09:19:42] <sorens3n> im not looking keycodes up for you
[09:19:44] <sorens3n> =\
[09:19:53] <eddiemonge> mbutubuntu, google it or try console.log( e.which) with all the keys

[09:30:24] <vasocreta> I am at my wits end. I am even using script loader to ensure that the jquery scripts are not executed until all of the DOM is ready.
[09:30:33] <vasocreta> this works perfectly on my Dev machine.
[09:31:06] <dragoonis> Has anyone moved the position of the "close" button of colorbox ?
[09:31:16] <dragoonis> by default its on the bottom left, and i'd like it on the top right
[09:31:36] <vasocreta> dragoonis: is that not in the CSS?
[09:31:50] <dragoonis> no it looks strange coz theres gaps where the close button _used_ to be
[09:33:55] <vasocreta> dragoonis: that is strange. It should be a div, #cboxClose that is absolutely positioned. You should be able to putit anywhere.

[09:42:15] <lugzer> hey guys where would i store datepicker data so that it can be later used by php script (results by rangedate etc)?
[09:45:46] <eddiemonge> lugzer, what do you mean store it? like permanently or while the user is on the page? what kind of data?
[09:47:05] <lugzer> eddiemonge, while user is on the page. data would be just selected datepicker date and possibly checkbox data (y/n)
[09:47:12] <Clut3r> thanks @eddiemonge & @bot-t
[09:47:47] <lugzer> right now i'm using input hidden fields, but i realized it's unnecessary intermediate state..
[09:48:14] <eddiemonge> lugzer, then its already on the page. you dont need to store it
[09:49:36] <lugzer> eddiemonge, right, but i realized that when used hidden input, and selected a date in datepicker, after page reload the actual php variable was still having the selected date
[09:49:48] <lugzer> even though i'm setting it in a script
[09:51:22] <eddiemonge> huh?
[09:51:32] <eddiemonge> php and your form have nothing to do with each other
[09:51:53] <lugzer> yeah i don't get it either. trying to debug it for a while now..
[09:53:13] <eddiemonge> whats to debug?
[09:54:03] <lugzer> it looks like that: php script sets default date in hidden field to today's date. jquery datepicker on date select changes value of hidden field to for example 1.06.2011. after page reload the value of hidden field does not reset. but when i put cursor in url bar of browser and hit enter, then it gets reset...
[09:55:30] <dorgan> can anyone tell me if there is something wrong with this code:  http://pastie.org/private/nuqglnle1tnyk4yusgpmq  its only a couple of line but it seems to be causing some type of error that is causing the page to refresh which I assume is just the e-commerce carts doing

[10:01:02] <gnarf> jay138: like what?
[10:02:13] <eddiemonge> lugzer, is your original page getting cached?
[10:02:56] <lugzer> eddiemonge, just checked, it is not getting cached and i emptied cache just in case, and tested. stil the same. this is strange
[10:03:21] <eddiemonge> dorgan, it should be window.location.href or something similar see ?g mdc window.location
[10:03:22] <bot-t> dorgan, window.location - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[10:03:41] <eddiemonge> lugzer, have the php echo the value to something not hidden somewhere else
[10:05:05] <redeeman> is there a way to interrupt a window.settimeout?
[10:05:12] <lugzer> i do that at the same time i create the hidden input field, and it's still the same date..
[10:05:13] <eddiemonge> redeeman, clearTimeout
[10:07:20] <eddiemonge> lugzer, whats the php code? is there a link to the page?
[10:07:25] <melvinram> when you have a selector like this: $('.next').click(function(){ ... }); do you have the ('.next') element available to reference somehow in the function? maybe using something like self?

[10:10:41] <lugzer> eddiemonge, but that's another reason i shouldn't use hidden fields for that...
[10:12:38] <jay138> http://paste.org/pastebin/view/34645 ,plese see here,the alert(row.name) is not executing due to asynchromous nature of javascript
[10:14:03] <gnarf> jay138: i don't see any jquery
[10:14:28] <melvinram> eddiemonge & jonathansampson : this and $(this) didn't seem to do the trick ... or maybe there is a different bug in my code https://gist.github.com/5aeea6ede5d40ecf14db can you guys take a quick look?
[10:14:45] <melvinram> I'm trying to make a jquery carousel that allows you to have multiple carousel
[10:14:46] <melvinram> s
[10:15:10] <melvinram> wait
[10:15:12] <melvinram> nvm
[10:15:17] <eddiemonge> melvinram, turn it into a plugin
[10:15:40] <eddiemonge> melvinram, you need to use $(this)
[10:16:05] <eddiemonge> and cache $(this) and $(this).parent('.slides ul')
[10:17:00] <melvinram> eddiemonge: that doesn't work
[10:17:53] <melvinram> nothing happens when i click
[10:18:11] <melvinram> no errors in console
[10:19:14] <eddiemonge> paste it to jsfiddle
[10:19:41] <eddiemonge> and it should be siblings or next, not parent
[10:19:54] <eddiemonge> or .parent().find('....)
[10:20:36] <melvinram> that worked
[10:23:21] <amid_hasan> What is the syntax for attaching an event to dynamically generated markup?
[10:23:39] <djQuery> amid_hasan: see ?delegate
[10:23:39] <bot-t> amid_hasan, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:23:48] <djQuery> amid_hasan: see ?.live
[10:23:49] <bot-t> amid_hasan, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:23:50] <amid_hasan> I.e. if I create an <a href="" id="foo"></a> how do I target the ID of the created tag?
[10:24:22] <juha____> why .live() doesn't work inside a plugin?
[10:24:36] <amid_hasan> djQuery: thank you!
[10:24:40] <jay138> gnarf:it is javascript.don't I can ask about javascript here?
[10:24:42] <djQuery> amid_hasan: typicaly with dynamicaly created content you dont target it by id.
[10:24:52] <amid_hasan> how do you usually target it?
[10:25:03] <jay138> gnarf:can;t I ask about javascript here?
[10:25:11] <melvinram> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/2fqaM/1/ that's the version that worked
[10:25:19] <gnarf> jay138: this is a jquery support channel, it would help if your problem was with jQuery
[10:25:39] <jay138> gnarf:jquery has simmilar asynochronous nature
[10:25:52] <gnarf> but its not jQuery...
[10:25:58] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan, typically you assign it to a var and then operate on the var
[10:26:05] <djQuery> $('.maincontent').delegate('a.someclass', 'click', function(e){  console.log(this.id); e.preventDefault(); });
[10:26:13] <eddiemonge> jay138, thats a facebook support question
[10:27:59] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan,   var newLink = $('<a/>', {options});  newLink.doStuff()
[10:28:26] <amid_hasan> djQuery: I will jsfiddle what I have. If you could, let me know if I am applying the event properly..
[10:28:27] <jay138> <eddiemonge> this is not a problem of facebook query.If I put any function there which takes time ,does not get executed
[10:28:28] <djQuery> always love looking at someones code and see how often they dont cache $(this)
[10:29:03] <djQuery> amid_hasan: you can see here a couple times that I am using delegate with dynamic content
[10:29:05] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/aboma3/13/edit
[10:29:53] <eddiemonge> jay138, ok but its not jquery either. i dont even know what the problem is though
[10:30:22] <djQuery> eddiemonge: the problem is someone is using facebook
[10:30:30] <djQuery> rather anyone is using facebook
[10:32:41] <vasocreta> not sure if I missed someone's response. Tried to look back. But does anyone have any insight as to what might be causing an issue with my slideshow starting at pic #8: .mvwtechnology.com/index.php
[10:32:54] <vasocreta> http://annejoyce.mvwtechnology.com/index.php
[10:32:58] <vasocreta> oops
[10:33:28] <vasocreta> I am having a devil of a time with this and I really need a point in the right direction
[10:33:32] <tommy_the_dragon> im having some problems with a pretty simple ajax script
[10:33:35] <tommy_the_dragon> http://codepad.org/WWod7Rgn
[10:33:44] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, yoour margins are messed up
[10:33:48] <djQuery> vasocreta: it started on the pic that was in the upper left corner of the thumnails for me
[10:34:09] <eddiemonge> does no one read the topic anymore?
[10:34:18] <vasocreta> grrr. so yours are not seeing the pic get centered at all?
[10:34:26] <vasocreta> *guys
[10:34:28] <tommy_the_dragon> sorry
[10:35:26] <vasocreta> eddiemonge: my margins are auto calculated by a plugin in order to center the image.
[10:35:27] <eddiemonge> tommy_the_dragon, problems i can see (even though you didnt say) is that the $(this) in the post callback isnt targeting what you think it is, your url is absolute instead of relative and your .attr is getting the initial value
[10:35:35] <djQuery> vasocreta: the first one show up ok but the rest are lower right  using chrome 13
[10:35:40] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, and its not working correctly from what i can see
[10:37:05] <vasocreta> this is very disheartening. It seems that my scripts are effecting the DOM before it is ready? Not sure.
[10:37:56] <djQuery> vasocreta: $(document).ready(funciton(){ code here });
[10:37:56] <amid_hasan> djQuery: here's what I have so far
[10:37:57] <amid_hasan> http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/eWFnt/
[10:38:00] <amid_hasan> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/eWFnt/
[10:38:44] <vasocreta> djQuery, yeah. I know. BUt the behavior does not suggest that is what is happening.
[10:38:46] <amid_hasan> oops: djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/5JjVY/1/
[10:38:48] <amid_hasan> this works
[10:38:50] <vasocreta> back to the drawing board
[10:39:09] <djQuery> amid_hasan: $(span).val() is not valid. spans dont have values that have .text();
[10:39:45] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, for fun, add your code to a $(function() {  ... }); block
[10:40:08] <mbutubuntu> I need to define a general function when an ajax error is encountered, but $.ajaxSetup seems to work only with 404, 500 http errors but not with timeout; including an error callback in the forced-timeout request it works.
[10:40:16] <vasocreta> eddiemonge: trying that now. I am using a script loader called headjs.
[10:40:35] <amid_hasan> djQuery: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/5JjVY/4/
[10:40:47] <vasocreta> so, I will initialize the call to head.js in a doc ready call
[10:40:49] <mbutubuntu> forced-timeout request is a request to a server page that sleeps for an amount of time bigger than timeout ajax value
[10:41:16] <djQuery> amid_hasan: $('#results').delegate('a',Â 'click',Â function(e){ e.preventDefault(); /* rest of code here */ });
[10:41:30] <amid_hasan> thanks!
[10:42:46] <janthony> ('ul#main-nav').find('li.current-menu-ancestor') is only returning the fist match, should it be returning all matches? If not, how do I get it to find all matches?
[10:43:11] <djQuery> amid_hasan: also seeing as how they can click on the Show Me Numbers button several times and then have multiple <a id="doSave"   give the <a a class of dosave instead of an id of dosave
[10:43:57] <amid_hasan> djQuery: this is needed because there cannot be multiple divs with same id, correct?
[10:44:11] <amid_hasan> *a hrefs
[10:44:14] <djQuery> there cannot be multiple anythings with the same id
[10:44:24] <janthony> According to the manual it's suppose to return all matched elements, but my console.log() is only returning the first matched.
[10:44:27] <t0th> hi
[10:44:34] <BitcoSoftware> How can I tell if an animation has stopped so I can run another Function?  This is the what I am using: $('#AdvSearch').stop().animate({ 'height': 'show' }, 'fast');  I want to know when that is finished?
[10:44:47] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan, http://jsfiddle.net/5JjVY/8/
[10:44:53] <djQuery> janthony: view source and make sure that there are what u think there are there
[10:44:55] <t0th> how i can make this string: i love ção to i-love-cao ?
[10:44:56] <tmayr> BitcoSoftware: use a callback inside it ;)
[10:45:15] <BitcoSoftware> how would I do that?
[10:45:18] <eddiemonge> janthony, what is the markup?
[10:45:19] <tmayr> $('#AdvSearch').stop().animate({}, fast, function(){})
[10:45:31] <eddiemonge> ?isanimating
[10:45:31] <BitcoSoftware> cool.. I will try that
[10:45:32] <djQuery> t0th: not realy a jquery question but you could split it then join it
[10:45:32] <bot-t> eddiemonge, :animated Selector - Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[10:45:42] <t0th> ok
[10:45:52] <eddiemonge> tmayr, see that ^ ?
[10:46:01] <tmayr> i see that
[10:46:07] <eddiemonge> oops meant BitcoSoftware
[10:46:52] <janthony> eddiemonge: Wierd, did $('#main-nav').find('li.current-menu-ancestor'); in console run command it is returning TypeError: $("#main-nav") is null
[10:46:56] <BitcoSoftware> Awsome.. that worked... thank you
[10:47:20] <nicovalencia> hola amigos - so I came across some weirdness this morning - I'm hitting a tmpl script tag in a jQuery mobile app and it's making a random request for /#hash. It only happens on pages with a #hash set... does anyone know if this is intended behaviour? The tmpl script tag is already in the DOM...
[10:47:42] <eddiemonge> janthony, then that mains you dont have a div with that id
[10:48:04] <janthony> eddiemonge: <ul id="main-nav" class="menu">
[10:48:16] <eddiemonge> nicovalencia, its probably the ajax but im not really sure what you are asking
[10:48:31] <eddiemonge> janthony, without an example at jsfiddle or a live link i couldnt tell you
[10:48:54] <nicovalencia> I call something like: $( '#script_tag_id' ).tmpl( {} );
[10:49:12] <nicovalencia> And if w.location.hash is set, it will make some random request to /hash.
[10:49:46] <nicovalencia> It parses the template correctly, but I just can't what that random request is...
[10:54:09] <SkyFlyer> question: I have a resizable div, then I change the value of it and when I do that change of value, the resizable stops working?  it's a $('#item').html('this new value');  so when i run that, I loose the resizable ??
[10:57:18] <vasocreta> ok, back to basics. When the DOM is considered ready, that means that all elements have loaded, right? Including images?
[10:57:27] <erichynds> no images
[10:57:32] <vasocreta> ah....
[10:57:38] <erichynds> when the DOM structure is ready
[10:57:43] <vasocreta> that could be the root of my issue
[10:57:47] <erichynds> not the resources within it
[10:58:02] <erichynds> $(window).load() waits for images
[10:58:25] <vasocreta> ercihynds: thx. Applying.
[10:58:47] <vasocreta> will let you know what I come up with using that knowledge
[10:59:21] <erichynds> i cannot wait!
[10:59:29] <NateDawg> hello
[10:59:47] <NateDawg> need help with some jquery plugins
[11:00:40] <JKarsrud> NateDawg: ask away
[11:01:35] <NateDawg> pretty new to javascript so cant figure out how to incorporate scripts i download off the net into my current site
[11:01:40] <d4rklit3> im trying to figure out what attr i can use to uniquely name a div
[11:01:46] <NateDawg> i want to upload and crop files and have find uploadify and jcrop
[11:01:48] <d4rklit3> i dont want it to be linked ot a css class
[11:01:57] <erichynds> d4rklit3: id
[11:01:59] <d4rklit3> just a name, however eclipse gives me shit over using name attr
[11:02:16] <melvinram> I've got this jquery carosel code that i wrote... and I'm wondering if I've written it the best way possible or if there are better ways to write it: https://gist.github.com/5aeea6ede5d40ecf14db
[11:02:19] <JKarsrud> d4rklit3: that's what id is for
[11:02:21] <d4rklit3> erichynds: it will still use class="" for its css
[11:02:22] <JKarsrud> ?id
[11:02:22] <bot-t> #id: Selects a single element with the given id attribute. http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[11:02:39] <erichynds> d4rklit3: that's fine
[11:02:51] <erichynds> you don't need to style elements with an ID if you don't want to
[11:02:58] <phlp> i forgot to bring a spoon to work today so i'm eating chicken noodle soup with crackers, a coffee stir, and a toothpick
[11:03:15] <mangos> MCGYVER
[11:03:19] <PineappleClock> there is no spoon
[11:03:25] <melvinram> PS: It's working... my main concern is when I use it on 30+ carousels, it's going to slow down the computer
[11:06:50] <imanc> hey can anyone tell me how to define a variable scope?
[11:07:29] <gopus> I have a .live event that does not work with a particular element. It works when I, for instance, assign it to 'img', but not to the element I want. Additionally, if I replace .live with .bind, it will work as well. Is there any reason a .live event might not work with a particular selector?
[11:07:58] <ajpiano> gopus: is that event load?
[11:08:11] <sent> morning
[11:08:12] <gopus> ajpiano: I'm sorry what do you mean?
[11:08:17] <ajpiano> which event.
[11:08:18] <ajpiano> type.
[11:08:23] <gopus> oh 'click'
[11:08:37] <ajpiano> that is curious, you should post a demo of it failng
[11:08:39] <sent> so i'm wondering
[11:08:54] <gopus> ajpiano: I mean, I have a website if I can link to that...
[11:08:55] <JKarsrud> gopus: yeah, make a fiddle of that, becuase that sounds odd
[11:09:03] <JKarsrud> or link to a website
[11:09:04] <JKarsrud> ;)
[11:09:19] <ajpiano> yes
[11:09:56] <sent> let's say we have a div of 1000 pixels wide, and fixed element A floated on the left of the div, and a fluid element on the right, both floated into one row. I'm trying to find a best case for "expanding" element A, and preventing element B from dropping below element A, which has happened in my tests. Element A contains a h2, that does not want to wrap, seemingly.
[11:10:02] <gopus> ajpiano: http://www.millerc.com/new - if you click on a BUILDING, and then you click and select a USER, an alert should pop up... it should do more but it doesn't
[11:10:20] <sent> any suggestions?
[11:10:24] <ajpiano> you'll have to give me a few minutes
[11:10:30] <gopus> ajpiano: yes sir
[11:10:50] <poop_in_yo_soup> Could someone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/ygcjy/8/ ? the title variable doesnt seem to be returning, is it something to do with when getJSON runs?
[11:11:09] <sent> nobody?
[11:11:21] <sent> i mean, i was using animate('width') and toggle('fast')

[11:11:41] <swiggy> anyone know of any issues with IE + jquery tabs w/ loading the content via ajax and it not working?

[11:12:56] <poop_in_yo_soup> 100s of thousands*
[11:13:08] <swiggy> so is there any known issues with jquery Ajax and IE?

[11:15:56] <sent> actually

[11:16:54] <Jakey> simple
[11:17:00] <phlp> gopus: dont know for sure but a return false in a bind will make the live not work
[11:17:01] <Jakey> you need to balance A and B
[11:17:07] <Jakey> so they add up to 1000px
[11:17:10] <dabbish> Can anyone offer me pointers what I need to do here? Using jquery or standard js. I'm trying to figure out how to fetch data from an asynchronous callback function: http://jsbin.com/egevi4/edit
[11:18:05] <gopus> phlp: does it need to be a bind that is relevant to the live?
[11:18:06] <melvinram> Can anyone look at this jquery carrousel code that i wrote and see if there are optimizations I could add to make it faster (performance wise): https://gist.github.com/5aeea6ede5d40ecf14db
[11:18:23] <gopus> phlp: is there documentation on when lives won't work due to return falses in binds somewhere that you know of?
[11:18:35] <sent> jakey: forgive me, but the container is actually fluid, not 1000px
[11:18:56] <Jakey> ok..

[11:19:11] <coreyman> melvinram did you write one yourself that you can put multiples on one page?
[11:19:45] <melvinram> coreyman: I modified code from http://web.enavu.com/tutorials/making-an-infinite-jquery-carousel/
[11:19:46] <Jakey> sent, you just need to float A and B
[11:19:55] <coreyman> melvinram - cool!
[11:19:55] <Jakey> and specify width for the A
[11:20:05] <melvinram> coreyman: but their thing wasn't working so I did lots of modifications

[11:21:57] <gopus> I'll just omit it and see if an alert occurs...
[11:22:04] <coreyman> melvinram - http://www.yourdomaingoeshere.com/testing2/reseller.html if i change the slider to the 'slide' event it is one value behind, 'change' event works fine.
[11:22:37] <melvinram> coreyman: if it works with change, why not keep it change?
[11:22:59] <gopus> phlp: well can't do that heh, but I bet that's the issue.
[11:23:00] <gopus> thank you.
[11:23:08] <coreyman> melvinram because I don't want them to have to let go of the slider to see the next package, I want it to change as they slide it.
[11:23:09] <phlp> np :)
[11:23:20] <djQuery> swiggy: can they access the url that the tab is loading directly?
[11:23:33] <djQuery> swiggy: what version of ie?
[11:23:49] <coreyman> melvinram if you saw the change event work, ill change it to the slide event so you can see what happens
[11:23:54] <swiggy> under IE8
[11:23:57] <swiggy> not IE8 or 9
[11:23:59] <djQuery> ?g jqueryui bugs @swiggy
[11:24:00] <bot-t> swiggy, the jQuery UI Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[11:24:18] <swiggy> ty dj_goku
[11:24:23] <swiggy> djQuery,  *
[11:24:34] <djQuery> swiggy: might try searching there for stuff related to tabs and ie7
[11:24:35] <dj_goku> swiggy: np :D
[11:24:43] <swiggy> well its not the tabs
[11:24:47] <swiggy> its the ajax succes()
[11:24:48] <melvinram> coreyman: works fine for me
[11:25:01] <coreyman> melvinram yes thats change event, now changing to slide
[11:25:13] <coreyman> melvinram ok try  now
[11:25:32] <melvinram> coreyman: okay so it doesn't have the slide effect when doing change
[11:25:41] <coreyman> melvinram exactly
[11:26:00] <coreyman> melvinram and slide event doesnt work correctly, and i dont know why
[11:27:06] <coreyman> Here are the docs on it, I don't know if I'm missing something http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
[11:28:24] <swiggy> anyone have a predesigned 'comic voice textbox' layout prebuild?
[11:28:29] <swiggy> you know of of those bubbles
[11:28:37] <swiggy> that directs where the text from the cartoon is
[11:29:17] <melvinram> coreyman: not sure man
[11:32:20] <melvinram> coreyman: what if you replaced $("#package" + $( "#theSlider" ).slider( "option", "value" )).addClass("packageSelected"); with
[11:32:49] <melvinram> $(this).slider( "option", "value" )).addClass("packageSelected");
[11:33:58] <coreyman> melvinram it says there is a syntax error.
[11:34:03] <sent> Jakey: there?
[11:34:14] <sent> Jakey: http://jsbin.com/atare6/2
[11:35:11] <melvinram> coreyman: try  $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#package" + $( this)( "option", "value" )).addClass("packageSelected");
[11:35:32] <melvinram> coreyman: i mean $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#package" + $( this)( "option", "value" )).addClass("packageSelected");
[11:35:48] <melvinram> err remove the irc part
[11:36:14] <melvinram> $("#package" + $(this)( "option", "value" )).addClass("packageSelected");
[11:36:24] <coreyman> melvinram ahh yeah... i just realized thats what you  meant it does nothing different
[11:36:55] <melvinram> coreyman: k one sec
[11:37:13] <melvinram> coreyman: I'm pretty sure it's the timing of getting that value that is the issue
[11:37:44] <coreyman> melvin idk how i could do it sooner :P
[11:38:36] <coreyman> melvinram i just erased the part that erases the backgrounds and it still does the same thing
[11:40:44] <melvinram> coreyman: try https://gist.github.com/5f1082e1ca69a9596dfa
[11:43:30] <coreyman> melvinram it isnt sliding now... im trying to see why
[11:46:52] <coreyman> melvinram on slide activity :( can't see anything obvious.
[11:47:28] <sent> gentlemen
[11:47:29] <sent> http://jsbin.com/atare6/2
[11:47:34] <sent> how can we have B wrap instead of push?
[11:47:39] <sent> (on clicking A)
[11:47:58] <ryanneufeld> ?.wrap() @ sent
[11:47:59] <bot-t> sent, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[11:48:16] <sent> ryanneufeld: i don't think that's the proper function
[11:48:31] <sent> that's for <div id=A><div id=B></div></div>
[11:48:37] <sent> it's not related to word-wrap
[11:49:04] <ryanneufeld> that's a css thing
[11:49:19] <ryanneufeld> you'd need to set a static width on the container element
[11:49:25] <sent> that's not an option
[11:50:28] <pedramphp> http://www.modernizr.com/
[11:50:38] <pedramphp> how did the get the twitter
[11:50:45] <pedramphp> and all social networking sites on the right side
[11:50:46] <coreyman> ok melvinram found the error, you forgot the slider  after $(this)
[11:50:46] <sent> pedramphp: you accidentally the verb
[11:50:50] <pedramphp> with data-alt
[11:50:51] <coreyman> melvinram and it still behaves the same way
[11:50:57] <pedramphp> I can't understand how it works
[11:51:03] <pedramphp> I change data-alt ="" value
[11:51:10] <pedramphp> it changes the DOM
[11:51:28] <pedramphp> any comments
[11:51:29] <pedramphp> ?
[11:51:41] <melvinram> coreyman: I'm trying to get it to work in http://jsfiddle.net/vb4LR/
[11:51:49] <coreyman> melvinram i see.
[11:51:51] <melvinram> slider isn't showing up
[11:51:59] <coreyman> melvin ram you forgot the slide keyword
[11:52:03] <coreyman> ill help
[11:52:39] <coreyman> melvinram you need to include the other JS files
[11:53:16] <coreyman> melvinram and the other css file
[11:53:48] <bemson> I'm a plugin noob - is $.fn.extend() the old way? Should I just do $.fn.pluginName?
[11:54:48] <melvinram> coreyman: http://jsfiddle.net/vb4LR/4/ did it still no slider
[11:57:31] <bemson> anyone?
[11:57:31] <coreyman> melvinram here -> http://jsfiddle.net/vb4LR/6/
[11:57:54] <bemson> Wondering why there is $.fn.extend() when I can do $.fn.pluginName = {}...
[11:58:12] <swiggy> is there a better way to check for null values/all spaces on input textboxes rather than      if ( $(this).val() == '' || $(this).val() == ' ' ) { return false; }
[11:58:35] <bemson> swiggy: use a regular expression
[11:58:36] <jonathansampson> Swiggy, You can also check length.
[11:58:46] <swiggy> length = 0
[11:58:48] <swiggy> good calll
[11:58:59] <bemson> swiggy: that doesn't check for spaces does it?
[11:58:59] <swiggy> ? length
[11:59:00] <bot-t> length: The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[11:59:11] <swiggy> ?length
[11:59:12] <bot-t> length: The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[11:59:13] <jonathansampson> You would need to remove whitespace, then check length.
[11:59:18] <swiggy> hrm
[11:59:23] <swiggy> looking for an all 1 in
[11:59:25] <jonathansampson> Swiggy, I'm referring to the javascript property.
[11:59:25] <swiggy> check
[11:59:30] <bemson> jonathansampson: that's two steps - why not use one?
[11:59:41] <swiggy> yes i agree bemson
[11:59:49] <swiggy> now i just need a regex, which i toalllllly suck at
[12:00:27] <jonathansampson> Checking $.val() doesn't work?
[12:00:29] <phlp>  /^\s*$/.test($(this).val())
[12:00:48] <swiggy> i still need a regex to test with
[12:01:21] <bemson> swiggy: if ($(this).val().match(/^$|^\s+$/)) {badvalue}
[12:01:51] <swiggy> ty bem
[12:01:56] <bemson> swiggy: np
[12:02:30] <bemson> back to my question on plugin authoring... is $.fn.extend() the old way? Should I just use $.fn.pluginName = {} ?
[12:02:43] <melvinram> coreyman: http://jsfiddle.net/vb4LR/7/
[12:03:09] <swiggy> i usually use $.fn.pluginname
[12:03:17] <swiggy> and it doesnt seem to cause any problems
[12:03:29] <bemson> swiggy:  I'm trying to figure out if one is newer and the other is slated for deprecation
[12:03:39] <swiggy> ah, i am not sure
[12:03:48] <bemson> swiggy: no biggy - thx and gl!
[12:03:56] <melvinram> coreyman: essentially that last line becomes $("#package" + ui.value).addClass("packageSelected");
[12:06:09] <coreyman> melvinram ahh, where did you find that out
[12:06:50] <melvinram> coreyman: well i saw function(event, ui) so i was curious what ui was in that
[12:06:57] <juha____> every fukkin time i ask someone to do something for me, i end up doing it myself :D
[12:07:15] <melvinram> coreyman: so i looked in the documentation, and it said ui.value gives you the new value
[12:07:33] <coreyman> melvinram what we were using gives the value after the slide has happened?
[12:08:28] <melvinram> coreyman: sort of... it gives value of the last time the slide happened
[12:08:58] <melvinram> coreyman: as in, last known value of slider
[12:09:06] <coreyman> melvinram ahh.... well that definately needs to be better documented.
[12:09:44] <coreyman> melvinram thank you very much
[12:09:59] <melvinram> np
[12:11:19] <coreyman> melvinram so i could use what i was using instead of the for loop now :P
[12:11:55] <melvinram> coreyman: not sure... i closed it already
[12:12:11] <coreyman> melvinram oh i dont need any help i was just making a conclusion :P
[12:12:23] <melvinram> coreyman: gotcha... cool
[12:15:44] <supsup> sup
[12:16:00] <coreyman> melvinram instead of the for loop its only two lines now :P https://gist.github.com/1017477
[12:16:35] <melvinram> sweet
[12:16:46] <supsup> no loop gtfo
[12:17:52] <coreyman> melvinram i assume that takes out some overhead and makes the script more effecient.
[12:18:20] <melvinram> coreyman: probably
[12:21:00] <le_coeur> hi Maubot
[12:27:57] <tomasm-> is there an easy way in jquery to take a string and translate it to an abbreviation? ie first letter of each word....
[12:28:13] <Isis___> hello everybody, im trying to use 'input[name=this_name]' with no results, as im running jq 1.5.1 , can anybody throw me some light on this matter? thanks
[12:28:32] <devinrolsen> input[name="this_name"] Isis___
[12:28:38] <Isis___> thankss
[12:28:38] <devinrolsen> you forgot the double quotes
[12:29:29] <jonathansampson> Actually, I thought I heard on the jQuery podcast that quoting attributes with that selector is optional now.
[12:29:45] <Isis___> mmm well now it works
[12:29:52] <jonathansampson> Interesting.
[12:30:00] <jonathansampson> What version of jQuery are you loading?
[12:30:03] <jonathansampson> 1.6?
[12:30:07] <Isis___> 1.5.1
[12:30:10] <Isis___> yet ;)
[12:30:19] <jonathansampson> Perhaps it's a 1.6 thing, or perhaps I heard wrong :)
[12:30:23] <jonathansampson> I'm going to go check the source.
[12:30:50] <Isis___> i dunno anything about 1.6 , i just fear to change it because im on production
[12:31:11] <jonathansampson> Stick with what works :)
[12:31:16] <Isis___> yeaa
[12:32:09] <systemfault> Damn jQuery :/
[12:32:36] <Isis___> hahaha
[12:33:10] <jonathansampson> As far back as one year ago Karl Swedberg was posting code examples in the API that lacked the quotes.
[12:33:27] <jonathansampson> What was the name you wrapped with quotes? I wonder if it's a character issue.
[12:33:40] <Isis___> yeah it seems its been deprecated from 1.4
[12:34:10] <jonathansampson> What has? The need to quote?
[12:34:24] <jonathansampson> For the record, I've always provided single quotes - for readability :)
[12:34:41] <jackdempsey> hey all, doing some stuff with a bookmarklet. i'm trying to unbind the parent pages events as they're screwing with my buttons/forms after writing them to the page
[12:35:05] <jackdempsey> i thought i could do $("body").unbind() to just remove their handlers, but doesn't seem to be working
[12:35:17] <jackdempsey> guessing i'm doing it wrong, or it's not possible
[12:35:30] <jackdempsey> any tips? is what i'm asking clear?
[12:36:13] <Isis___> did you try with "html" instead of body?
[12:36:25] <jackdempsey> nope, will try
[12:36:46] <jackdempsey> damn, still is grabbing/rewriting my stuff
[12:37:08] <devinrolsen> Anyone interested in here willing to test my new CSS auditor tool I just finished up?
[12:37:21] <devinrolsen> http://tinyurl.com/3gx7fw5 go here, save the bookmarklet and run it over any site you want to aduit.
[12:39:57] <notjrbauer> Can I pm a question to someone, it involves a log-in
[12:40:03] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: doesnt handle @import
[12:40:17] <devinrolsen> sorry not at this time.
[12:40:17] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ notjrbauer
[12:40:18] <bot-t> notjrbauer, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:40:26] <ryanneufeld> ?axe @ notjrbauer
[12:40:26] <bot-t> notjrbauer, If you have a question, please just axe it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't axe to axe. Don't PM! Don't axe if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just axe the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:40:56] <devinrolsen> but it is at least a global audit tool.. not like most ff plugins that only scan a single page per-report.
[12:41:07] <devinrolsen> with mine, the more pages you browse the more accurate the report gets.
[12:41:16] <devinrolsen> so, its a global audit tool.
[12:41:48] <ryanneufeld> right, but it doesn't understand @import delcarations
[12:41:59] <ryanneufeld> or query strings apparently
[12:42:05] <bucket> I have a jqueryUI resazable div floated left that serves as my menu bar.  I want to have the content area expand as the menu contracts.  What is the best way to do this?
[12:42:16] <devinrolsen> indeed, there are still some things to work out.
[12:42:21] <ryanneufeld> we're testing it on our local dev environment
[12:42:26] <devinrolsen> no
[12:42:30] <ryanneufeld> otherwise, not a bad execution
[12:42:43] <ryanneufeld> I'd drop the font size about 2-3px though
[12:43:24] <notjrbauer> ryan, I can ask my question in public but it wont be any good without the log in to see
[12:43:25] <dalaen> Hej here, may be a stupid question, but is it really possible to master jquery with doc/tuto availables on jquery.com ? they don't look friendly :(
[12:43:26] <devinrolsen> cool, noted.
[12:44:14] <devinrolsen> ok ryanneufeld, I see how I can allow it to use @import.. I should have that worked in later tonight.
[12:44:18] <devinrolsen> thanks for taking a look!
[12:44:22] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: also, our site has different css files for different types of pages, your script doesn't seem to pick up on that
[12:44:40] <devinrolsen> no, you can only audit one sheet at a time (right now)
[12:44:45] <ryanneufeld> ah
[12:44:56] <ryanneufeld> understood
[12:46:56] <Isis___> how do i concatenate a variable inside the jquery identyfier...ex jQuery('#'+var) ?
[12:47:12] <jonathansampson> Isis___ Yes.
[12:47:22] <jonathansampson> $("#foo_" + bar).remove();
[12:48:16] <devinrolsen> or even $('#foo_'+bar, this) Isis___ if you are under an elements scope :)
[12:48:27] <Isis___> im doing jQuery('#'+formname+' input[name:"mora"]').val();
[12:48:49] <devinrolsen> [name="mora"] not :
[12:49:02] <Isis___> yeeeeaa
[12:49:06] <Isis___> tnx
[12:49:06] <jonathansampson> devinrolsen++
[12:50:03] <freedrull> how can i test if $("tr#myid") exists?
[12:50:26] <makinen> if ($("tr#myid").length)
[12:50:28] <devinrolsen> if($('tr#myid').length)
[12:50:30] <devinrolsen> HAHA
[12:50:44] <Kambfhase> if($('#myid').length)
[12:51:02] <devinrolsen> although, why tr#myid?
[12:51:05] <jonathansampson> 0 == false :) Gotta love JavaScript.
[12:51:07] <devinrolsen> id should be unique
[12:51:44] <swiggy> does jquery havea nything to capitalize the first letter of a string? :P
[12:51:58] <Kambfhase> nope
[12:52:07] <swiggy> figures lol
[12:52:12] <devinrolsen> css does though... but that wont help.
[12:52:31] <freedrull> devinrolsen: hmm, i suppose id should be unique..
[12:52:34] <jonathansampson> See question 1026069 on Stackoveflow :)
[12:52:37] <makinen> devinrolsen: is it faster to search the dom tree if the selector contains the name of the element and its id?
[12:52:47] <coreyman> swiggy why not just get the first letter of the string with a str_str and capitalize it that way
[12:52:52] <devinrolsen> no
[12:53:02] <jonathansampson> function cap(string) { return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1); }
[12:53:21] <devinrolsen> cause it will hunt for all elements of that type first and then scrub them against the id.
[12:53:25] <devinrolsen> vs just hunting for the id
[12:53:55] <makinen> ok
[12:54:05] <swiggy> i am going to core
[12:54:12] <swiggy> just didnt know if there was something prebuilt
[12:54:30] <swiggy> string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
[12:54:43] <swiggy> function ucString(string){ string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1); }
[12:54:47] <swiggy> if anyone needs
[12:54:53] <jonathansampson> Swiggy I just posted that a few lines earlier ;)
[12:55:04] <swiggy> lol
[12:55:11] <swiggy> didnt notice lol
[12:55:17] <Kambfhase> for real?
[12:55:47] <devinrolsen> Kambfhase, its true.
[12:56:13] <Kambfhase> ?eval "for real?" == true
[12:56:14] <bot-t> Kambfhase: false
[12:56:21] <Kambfhase> hmmm
[12:56:25] <devinrolsen> haha
[12:59:47] <denysonique> I have just released a jQuery plugin: http://denysonique.github.com/imgPreload/ (written in CoffeeScript)
[13:03:33] <anilali> does anybody know why the custom validator rule doesn't fire in jquery validation when the text box is empty and the required validator is not used for the textbox
[13:03:54] <anilali> i am using unobtrusinve validation with asp.net mvc 3
[13:08:30] <anilali> does anybody know why a custom validator rule doesn't fire in jquery validation when the text box is empty and will fire for all other instances.  Noticed during debugging that the required validator is getting fired and intercepting the call
[13:09:49] <erichynds> anilali: your custom validation won't fire until there's text in the box, as long as the required validation is also present
[13:09:54] <erichynds> they fire one at a time
[13:10:07] <anilali> i don't have required validation on the text box
[13:10:21] <erichynds> why is the required validation firing?
[13:11:12] <anilali> i can't seem to figure that out...i am trying to create a fiddle
[13:11:47] <anilali> will post it here as soon as i can get it work
[13:11:52] <anilali> working*
[13:17:41] <AfroTurf>  $("#outerWrapper").css("min-height",$(document).height()-$("#footer").outerHeight()+"px"); <-- this works great when making the browser bigger.. but nothing happens when i make the browser smaller, how can i fix this?
[13:18:35] <AfroTurf> nvm window.height() did the trick :)
[13:21:08] <gopus> pngl: I don't know if I understand stopDefault and stopPropagation because they appear to stop events from moving up to the parent, but in my case the parent keeps an event tied to an element within from running
[13:22:11] <FinalAngel> is there a good tooltip plugin available where I can load more than just the title informations, like real html or split data and replace them within the generated tooltip html?
[13:23:20] <NateDawg> hey im using uploadify for my site but when i attempt to upload a file larger than the sizeLimit it alerts an error and crashes ff
[13:23:27] <NateDawg> tried it in chrom no problem
[13:23:34] <NateDawg> chrome*
[13:25:02] <Kambfhase> gopus: that should only happen if you use .live/delegate
[13:25:19] <impi> i thought i would give a quick progress report: http://dev.micket.me/test/test.php#
[13:25:40] <impi> thats all working fine now, the scrollable, and the tooltip if you hover over the purple
[13:26:53] <Kambfhase> impi: as paul irish would say: hawt!
[13:27:38] <impi> thank you kindly Sir! been most of the day a useless struggeling because of that scrollable, but now im moving at lightspeed.
[13:29:02] <gopus> Kambfhase: yeah man, I don't know. The live 'click' event only works if the actions that run in the parent do not exist.
[13:29:14] <khmer> ?eval (![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]+(!![]+[][(![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+[]]+(!![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+!+[]]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]
[13:29:14] <bot-t> khmer: "lol"
[13:29:38] <gopus> or... if there isn't a return false...
[13:29:51] <Kambfhase> gopus: yeah, live depends on the click event bubbling up to the document.
[13:30:15] <Kambfhase> so you cannot stop the event from bubbling if you use live afaik
[13:30:21] <SwiftOne> I've got a series of AJAX calls to make to a flakey web server that will often return 200 and no data.  I've wrapped my calls in deferreds and want to simply try again until I get either a real success or a real failure, which I'll report to the outside world.  Any ideas on how to elegantly loop AJAX calls?  My first attempt (recursion with named functions) worked but wasn't elegant.
[13:30:54] <Assimilater> hi all i'm trying to do a somewhat complicated process; here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/2Ycqf/5/
[13:31:02] <khmer> recursion with named functions actually seems like the most elegant idea to me, SwiftOne
[13:31:25] <Assimilater> the goal is to make a tr move from the search table to the found table when the button gets pushd
[13:31:44] <SwiftOne> khmer, I was afraid of that.  ah well.
[13:31:58] <gopus> Kambfhase: I got a <div> and enveloped in that div is an <a>. The <a> is the one that has a live event attributed to it. The <div> has a bind. And I have had the DIV return false, but when it return falses, the <a> live event inside doesn't work.
[13:32:02] <gopus> Kambfhase: :-(
[13:32:43] <Kambfhase> return false; << this stops bubbling. its a feature.
[13:33:14] <khmer> gopus: if you just want to prevent the default event, use e.preventDefault()
[13:33:20] <gopus> I understand, but I thought it stopped bubbling upward. The <a> event that doesn't work is INSIDE the div that return falses, not above it
[13:33:40] <gopus> khmer: I tried, but it did not work.
[13:33:49] <gopus> yet, it seems that that of all things would make it work...
[13:33:51] <Kambfhase> ?p @ gopus
[13:33:51] <bot-t> gopus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[13:33:51] <khmer> gopus: under the hood, what .live() does is it actually binds an event to document.
[13:34:05] <roger_padactor> what is the proper way to call js after loading content into a dialog and opening it? I created a function and i call it on dialog.open but it tells me its not defined, but its in the source code?
[13:34:27] <khmer> gopus: so you click on some link, and it bubbles all the way up to document before the .live catches it, examines its target property, and decides whether it satisfies the selector that you argued to .live()
[13:34:50] <khmer> gopus: so, though it looks like the event is bubbling "downwards", it's actually the live event that lives above the bound one
[13:35:40] <khmer> gopus: this is why people switch from .live() to .delegate()
[13:35:49] <khmer> gopus: .delegate() on the nearest nondynamic element you have
[13:36:19] <gopus> khmer: http://jsfiddle.net/kwb5D/
[13:36:21] <gopus> sorry
[13:36:31] <gopus> khmer: I needed to paste, I will read what you wrote.
[13:38:39] <gopus> khmer: I was unaware of .delegate I will read it. Thank you.
[13:38:54] <khmer> gopus: in this case, i don't see why you need to return false anyway
[13:39:52] <Assimilater> it appears that the main problem i have is that the handle is not getting added to the button...
[13:40:08] <Assimilater> (from looking at firebug anyways)
[13:40:27] <gopus> khmer: hmmm...
[13:40:38] <gopus> khmer: I don't either, but it doesn't seem to work without one.
[13:41:21] <khmer> gopus: what manner of element is #userdropdown?
[13:41:51] <gopus> <li>
[13:42:25] <Assimilater> oh wait
[13:42:29] <gopus> appears as a button...when clicked it produces a drop down
[13:42:32] <Assimilater> i think i may have an idea what the problem is...
[13:42:42] <Assimilater> load is non-interfering iirc
[13:42:48] <Assimilater> maybe use a callback function :S
[13:44:26] <Assimilater> hooray, i'm getting actual errors now
[13:45:26] <gopus> khmer: www.millerc.com/new <---- the Buildings button should produce a dropdown, without return false; it produces nothing...
[13:45:38] <gopus> now it might actually be from the nested stuff...
[13:47:51] <swiggy> is there an 'autogrow' feature in jquery ui by default?
[13:48:11] <swiggy> for textareas
[13:49:44] <Pataroulis> hi
[13:50:42] <bittyx-laptop> setting a container div to sortable, with items: 'div', isn't a permanent setting, right? (something like it's more .click() than .live() ) - ie. when i add new items to the div, i need to make it .sortable() again?
[13:50:50] <Pataroulis> hi
[13:51:01] <bittyx-laptop> because if i'm wrong about this, i have some other bug (and if i'm right, i'll know what to do)...
[13:51:07] <khmer> gopus: yeah i don't think you need to specify "#userdropdown div"
[13:51:16] <khmer> gopus: but also, whatever is running isn't doing what you want it to
[13:51:19] <bittyx-laptop> swiggy: what do you mean by 'autogrow'?
[13:51:31] <Pataroulis> do yoi know of a decent CSS editor I can use i my project?
[13:51:41] <gopus> khmer: yeah I took out the div...
[13:51:45] <bittyx-laptop> swiggy: as in, expand vertically during typing, if needed?
[13:51:55] <dyakovlev> is there an analog to prototype's Element for creating new dom elements? $('<div>').attr(...) seems kludgy by comparison...
[13:51:57] <gopus> khmer: yeah I guess not.
[13:51:58] <bittyx-laptop> Pataroulis: CSS editor? you mean a text editor?
[13:52:02] <jonathansampson> Pataroulis Just do it all by hand - you'll be glad you did later :)
[13:52:09] <gopus> khmer: I am going to try deleting all the functions except the one.
[13:52:12] <jonathansampson> Find any editor that has color-coding and you're good :)
[13:52:19] <bittyx-laptop> dyakovlev: $('<div></div>').attr(...) is how you do it in jquery
[13:52:30] <swiggy> yes
[13:52:33] <Pataroulis> no, I need my users to be able to edit some CSS aspects.
[13:52:41] <dyakovlev> bittyx-laptop: ok cool, so that's the accepted way. thanks!
[13:52:42] <swiggy> like on facebook, when you make a comment
[13:52:47] <swiggy> that is a textboxes
[13:52:55] <swiggy> textbox that autogrows
[13:52:55] <Pataroulis> I already started doing it by hand but I was wondering if I just reinvent the wheel
[13:52:58] <bittyx-laptop> dyakovlev: no problem! it's documented in the manual btw.
[13:53:15] <jonathansampson> Ah; so you'e going to let them write their own CSS and them strip out rules later to prevent them from destroying the integrity of your site?
[13:53:44] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: since you're using a string in your items option, you shouldn't have to reinvoke the sortable function; it's not storing a fixed selection of objects
[13:54:12] <Pataroulis> Actually I was thinking of just letting them move sliders around to modify some aspects of an already present CSS
[13:54:18] <gopus> khmer: great, so alone the function works... another function is messing things up :-)
[13:54:23] <gopus> khmer: thanks for the idea!
[13:54:48] <Pataroulis> something like http://www.css3maker.com but embeddable/simpler
[13:55:16] <Pataroulis> BTW you ARE a friendly channel :) the jQuery site states it correctly
[13:55:29] <rtraction> Hello. I'm having trouble getting jquery mobile links to work on my BlackBerry 5.0 device, but they're working in the simulator (same model). Any suggestions? It's a BlackBerry Tour 9630. It's the latest version of jQuery Mobiile, which is supposed to have better support for 5.0.
[13:55:52] <gopus> good deal...
[13:56:05] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: hmm, on initialization, i'm doing .sortable({ items: 'div', containment: container }), and that works fine for divs that are initially inside the container. however, once i add a new div, i can drag it, and it is properly constrained inside the container (ie. i can't drag it outside), but the items never seem to switch places. what could cause that?
[13:56:39] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/TaJqa/
[13:58:33] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: just updated the fiddle with your settings on the sortable
[13:58:36] <gopus> khmer: you rock!
[13:58:38] <jovrtn> seems to be working fine
[13:59:23] <rtraction> Is there anyone here who has worked with BlackBerry 5.0 WebWorks at all?
[13:59:25] <Assimilater> quick question, js substring's paramaters are first index and second index, right?
[13:59:44] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: yeah, i see it works correctly. hmm, now i'm getting *really* weird behavior. it seems there's only a problem when the container starts out with no divs inside. i'm gonna debug a little more, but thanks for trying.
[14:00:30] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: do you have a code sample? I suggest clearing the slate and building up from the basics, some unintended complexity may be throwing it off
[14:00:34] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: sure thing
[14:00:38] <khmer> gopus: :)
[14:00:55] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: i think it's a problem with some css stuff causing the container to appear misplaced to jquery. no live link right now, but i could upload it. just a sec.
[14:01:18] <gopus> ahhhh, it was a clickoutside function I took from someone...
[14:01:19] <gopus> :-/
[14:09:23] <stan_man_can> how do you insert a link into some text
[14:09:44] <stan_man_can> i've tried $("#whatever").text("<a href='#'>link</a>");
[14:09:47] <stan_man_can> but it just inserts it all as text
[14:10:05] <CoverSlide> .html()
[14:10:19] <ryanneufeld> .seen notjrbauer
[14:10:19] <hsbot> notjrbauer was seen 1 hour, 26 minutes and 55 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: ryan, I can ask my question in public but it wont be any good without the log in to see
[14:10:31] <CoverSlide> or probably better to use .append()
[14:11:54] <redflame> var data = [[[2003,3435],[3213,3213]],[[32324,32343][32132,4324]]], how to define this type of data dynamically using jquery?
[14:12:46] <redflame> I have a loop ,which is generating some numbers ,I want to put these numbers like above format.
[14:13:34] <Phil> redflame, that's a javascript array - jQuery has nothing to do with it
[14:13:43] <Kambfhase> maybe use a math libe
[14:14:19] <redflame> Phil:I have jqury plugin which needs data in that format
[14:14:52] <Phil> redflame, ok...
[14:15:02] <Kambfhase> a jquery plugin that uses tensors? sick
[14:15:18] <Phil> as I said, it's a 2d javascript array
[14:15:27] <Phil> there's plenty on Google about arrays in javascript
[14:15:33] <Kambfhase> Phil: 3d ;)
[14:15:36] <redflame> link to that plugin ,http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/visualizing-data-with-flot/.I have a loop which is generating numbers and I want to put those number in this format.how can I do that?
[14:15:55] <redflame> I have tried making 3d array but did not work
[14:16:22] <Kambfhase> redflame: please paste your loop to jsfiddle.net
[14:18:09] <redflame> Kambfhase: http://paste.org/pastebin/view/34666, with that plugin data under method 1 works but data under method 2 does not.
[14:19:15] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: still here? mind if i PM you with a live link?
[14:19:22] <redflame>  Kambfhase: are you able to see ?
[14:19:34] <phrearch> hm, somehow scrolldown with animate works, but setting the attribute doesnt.  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/403708/
[14:20:05] <Kambfhase> redflame: yes, but i cant see a flaw in that code
[14:20:19] <redflame>  Kambfhase: both are same?
[14:20:47] <Kambfhase> in theorie. yes. (btw, the top one creates a syntax error... )
[14:20:56] <redflame> Kambfhase : how do I convert data generated in method 2 in Json object?
[14:21:09] <Kambfhase> there is no such thing a s a json object
[14:21:14] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to determine not only when any link is clicked, but also when either the forward or back button ( or any action that would change the page location ) is is clicked ?
[14:21:48] <redflame>  Kambfhase:both methods generate same thing?
[14:21:52] <Cork[home]> FunnyLookinHat: the unload event
[14:22:12] <FunnyLookinHat> unload, eh?  And can I intercept that with a return false; to keep whatever it was from happening?
[14:22:21] <khmer> Kambfhase: what a douchey thing to say ;)
[14:22:39] <khmer> Kambfhase: of course there's such a thing as a json object. what do you call a string representation of valid json for short?
[14:22:43] <Kambfhase> redflame: method one is missing a ] but beside that, they should be equavalent
[14:22:53] <Kambfhase> string
[14:22:58] <systemfault> Kambfhase++
[14:22:59] <Cork[home]> FunnyLookinHat: you can, but the browser will show a dialog allowing the use to overide it
[14:23:25] <FunnyLookinHat> Cork, That's fine - as long as I can warn a user that the upload they were trying to accomplish isn't finished yet...  :)
[14:23:37] <Cork[home]> ?mdc beforeunload

[14:23:54] <Cork[home]> np
[14:23:57] <FunnyLookinHat> and Cork[home]   ;)
[14:24:05] <Cork[home]> same user ;)
[14:24:11] <FunnyLookinHat> Figured as much :D
[14:24:19] <bittyx-laptop> okay, i'll put up a live link here: http://nsnight.levacic.net/sort_test.html <--- there are 5 little thumbnail pictures in the lower part of the page (under the title: "Slike lokala (max 5):") <--- try dragging them around. they kinda fall under the div while being moved (as well as it being hard to place them correctly etc.). the minimal jquery code that causes this (basically just setting .sortable() with a couple of options) is included in
[14:24:19] <bittyx-laptop> http://nsnight.levacic.net/js/temp.js <--- if anyone can help with this, i'll be pretty grateful.
[14:24:24] <redflame> Kambfhase:but for that plugin ,only data defination under method 1 is working.method 2 is not working
[14:24:41] <Kambfhase> redflame: paste the rest of you code, pls.
[14:26:04] <redflame> Kambfhase: I used demo source code of this http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/visualizing-data-with-flot/
[14:27:22] <redflame> Kambfhase:are you able to see that code?
[14:28:10] <redflame> Kambfhase: it is provided on website itself.you can see here a var data which I wanted to define using 3d array.
[14:30:02] <redflame> anyone knows difference ?
[14:32:45] <redflame> how to create object data ?
[14:40:30] <FunnyLookinHat> I'm pretty sure you can't do this... but is it possible to facilitate multipart POST form submissions with files via $.post or a similar command?
[14:40:30] <onFilm> hey is there anyone that could help me with a small jquery-related question?
[14:40:42] <FunnyLookinHat> onFilm, just ask - hopefully one of us can :)
[14:41:18] <Phoenixz> I created a small jQuery app, works perfectly on chrome.. Now I try it on FireFox 3.6, and a click on a login button reloads the page.. I check the FF36 console for log data, but nothing.. Any idea on how to get an error out of this?
[14:41:29] <onFilm> I want to have alert() show up everytime the window obtains a scrollbar, and another alert() for when the scrollbar is removed.
[14:41:33] <onFilm> I tried the following but it does not alert when content is loaded into the body without changing the URL:
[14:41:42] <onFilm> if (document.documentElement.scrollHeight === document.documentElement.clientHeight) {...bla bla bla
[14:42:10] <onFilm> im using hash urls
[14:42:54] <joeytwiddle> Phoenixz: it reloads the page?  sounds like you've triggered some kind of navigation event (or perhaps failed to prevent an event from bubbling)
[14:43:24] <Phoenixz> onFilm: /me remembers reading in many articles that hashed URL's are a bad idea.. Im using normal url's (with real targets in case somebody opens them) and jQuery intercepts them.. first design site for 100% HTML, then add jQuery..
[14:43:55] <Phoenixz> joeytwiddle: Well yeah, jQuery would normally intercept the click on the button (which is in a form which probably causes a POST)
[14:44:03] <onFilm> no no
[14:44:12] <onFilm> i've made them so they work even without jquery
[14:44:12] <Phoenixz> joeytwiddle: but since there is SOME unknown failure, it reloads and at once I dont have the log console..
[14:45:27] <joeytwiddle> hehe naughty chrome :)
[14:45:51] <onFilm> I just cannot figure out how to display those messages when the window is resized
[14:46:01] <onFilm> everytime it's resized.
[14:46:41] <Phoenixz> joeytwiddle: FF actually.. chrome works fine..
[14:47:03] <Phoenixz> onFilm: check google, hashbangs can cause a nice amount of trouble, not sure why anymore..
[14:47:05] <joeytwiddle> oh i didn't think FF cleared the log
[14:47:21] <phlp> onFilm: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.onresize
[14:47:46] <bittyx-laptop> http://nsnight.levacic.net/sort_test.html <--- there's 5 little pictures in the lower part of the page. they're supposed to be .sortable(), but it's buggy for some reason - they drop beneath the parent div while dragged, but only sometimes, and sometimes it's hard to place them where you want. what could cause this?
[14:47:46] <joeytwiddle> onFilm: why do you want to show an alert() when the user gains or loses a scrollbar?
[14:48:55] <bittyx-laptop> there's weird behavior all over - if the first picture (the leftmost) is dragged, it doesn't "fall down", while others do. also, as soon as dragging one image is started, all the others drop down a bit as well (but not as much as the dragged one)
[14:50:31] <onFilm> Phoenixz :: thanks for letting me know. Didn't know about that, however, the way I have my site set up is eg. www.domain.com/dir/#document.html   so even with the hash removed, the content is still fully functional
[14:51:12] <onFilm> Joeytwiddle :: I'm having a button appear whenever content overflows from screen to scroll back up the page
[14:51:42] <Phoenixz> onFilm: yeah, well, as I understood it, if you can do it without hashes, do it without.. it would only serve for minor things like a login screen or so
[14:52:27] <onFilm> joey :: Maybe its a better idea to have the button appear once the scrollbar is touched?
[14:53:11] <phlp> onFilm: yes use this http://api.jquery.com/scroll
[14:53:34] <bittyx-laptop> can anyone at least confirm that my sortable is buggy?
[14:53:55] <lmao25> blur(function () { <-- how do add multiple events
[14:53:58] <lmao25> blur and something else
[14:54:21] <phlp> bittyx-laptop: yes i concur
[14:54:54] <onFilm> PHLP :: yep thought so, thanks.
[14:55:08] <bittyx-laptop> lmao25: you can use .bind('blur mousedown keyup', function() { ... });
[14:55:40] <dorgan> when I am inside of a click event i issue preventDefault() stopPropagation()   is there a way for me to get a list of the other functions or handlers that should have been called after mine?
[14:58:18] <redflame> any good plugin to make graph?
[14:58:45] <jedimind_> flot
[14:58:53] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: sorry, had a shower
[14:58:58] <bittyx-laptop> redflame: http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ <--- it's not a jquery plugin, it's a javascript toolkit, but it's awesome.
[14:59:36] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: oh, no need to apologize. i'm still unsure as to what is causing the weird behavior :/
[14:59:50] <jedimind_> redflame, http://code.google.com/p/flot/
[15:00:10] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: did you put up a demo somewheres?
[15:00:21] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: yup: http://nsnight.levacic.net/sort_test.html
[15:00:30] <redflame> I want plugin which can accept string on x axis.any suggestion?
[15:00:31] <phlp> dorgan: $(this).parents().data('events').click
[15:00:44] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: the jquery that initializes the sortable is in http://nsnight.levacic.net/js/temp.js
[15:01:07] <dorgan> yes but there may also be other events for the current object not just the parents
[15:01:14] <dorgan> phlp: sorry that was for you
[15:01:23] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: are you still having the issue with new items being movable but not actually changing position?
[15:01:29] <phlp> $(this).data('events').click
[15:01:53] <dorgan> would that also fire the current event as well?
[15:01:54] <redflame> any good suggestions ?
[15:02:33] <jedimind_> redflame, we just gave you two, what more do you want?
[15:02:47] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: yeah, but it's not in the demo. i think it's related to the overall "bugginess" of the whole thing. e.g. if you try dragging any item, all items move down a bit. when you drag the first item, you can place it where you like, but if you drag any other, it drops below the div.
[15:03:03] <bittyx-laptop> jovrtn: i think it might be related to the css layout but have no idea where to start debugging.
[15:03:10] <redflame> jedimind : I have tried that plugin but it does not accpet string on x -axis
[15:03:33] <jedimind_> it does not accept strings on x-axis? what are you talking about?
[15:04:05] <redflame> jedimind: I want to show data(which is string type)  on x -axis.
[15:04:13] <dorgan> phlp: yes/no?
[15:04:21] <jedimind_> yes and how does this prevent you from doing so?
[15:04:31] <jedimind_> i mean it's part of it's core functionality
[15:04:36] <jovrtn> bittyx-laptop: sent you a pm
[15:04:37] <jedimind_> its*
[15:04:56] <redflame> jedimind:but that flot plugin only accept numbers on x-axis ,it ignores string data.
[15:05:45] <jedimind_> it's just html, you can place whatever you want there, and there's also the other plugin the other person told you about
[15:05:49] <phlp> dorgan: it doesnt call anything, it is an object .handler is the function and firebug shows a guid that you could probably compare to the current event.handler but it doesnt seem to be working
[15:06:09] <dorgan> hmm
[15:06:14] <dorgan> ok i think thats a starting point
[15:09:16] <redflame> jedimind: it is also written in its documentation that it takes only numbers on x axis,http://flot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/API.txt
[15:09:57] <dorgan> does anyone know why a live event would not show up under $(this).data('events').click
[15:10:27] <jedimind_> redflame, youre missing the point, it's just html therefore you can put whatever content you want there, without having to feed it directly through the plugin
[15:10:31] <jedimind_> but i digress
[15:12:29] <dorgan> ahh because they are never bound there
[15:12:36] <dorgan> it never bound to the element
[15:12:51] <dorgan> is there a way to call any live events for a given element?
[15:13:31] <Klevre> I'm adding images dynamically to the page via ajax calls, what's a fast way to check if an image with the same src as that which already exists on the page is being added?
[15:13:52] <redflame> jedimind:but this plugin creates graph on the basis of data we give to it.and data is defined in javascript object.
[15:14:09] <redflame> jedimind: have you used it before?
[15:14:35] <phlp> dorgan: $(this).is($(document).data('events').live[0].selector)
[15:14:46] <dorgan> ahh live
[15:14:47] <dorgan> :D
[15:15:48] <dorgan> phpedinei: that returns false
[15:15:51] <dorgan> oops
[15:15:53] <redflame> jedimind: are you suggesting to overwrite data of x-axis after creating graph.
[15:16:08] <dorgan> phpl thats returns false
[15:17:06] <phlp> dorgan: do you have multiple live events? the [0] isn't guranteed to be the one you want. also it adds .live and .click not sure which you need
[15:17:24] <redflame> jedimind : are you here?
[15:17:34] <dorgan> phpl: $(this).is($(document).data('events').live[0].selector)   is returning false
[15:17:57] <dorgan> I'm assuming its the .is() thats causing that
[15:18:08] <dorgan> yes it seems this cart have multiple live events
[15:18:28] <chachan> guys, I would like to avoid using so many parent() calls and instead of that, start using selectors on this: http://fpaste.org/HQxJ/
[15:19:01] <chachan> any idea of how can I improve the line 15?
[15:19:18] <dorgan> phpl I'm assuming I need to to be looking at specified items in that array but not sure what to look at
[15:19:29] <redflame> did anyone use flot plugin?
[15:20:06] <redflame> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/visualizing-data-with-flot/
[15:20:31] <phlp> chachan: you can do .closest('tr').find('.taskBox input')
[15:21:20] <chachan> phlp, I realized closest, but  I didn't realize to use find() -.-
[15:21:31] <chachan> phlp, thanks :)
[15:21:42] <phlp> np :)
[15:23:30] <chachan> wow "find" is way too slow
[15:25:45] <GoGoGarrett> I'm pretty sure find is what is being performed behind the scenes for instance when you do $( "ul", "div")
[15:26:06] <erichynds> correct
[15:26:07] <GoGoGarrett> I believe it's performing $( "div" ).find( "ul" )
[15:26:39] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: you are correct
[15:26:51] <ryanneufeld> and it's faster to explicitly write that than to pass the context
[15:27:08] <GoGoGarrett> That's what I've read :]
[15:27:15] <ryanneufeld> http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child/5
[15:27:22] <merrick_____> im using the roundabout plugin to try to achieve an effect of particles floating in a 3d space.  is there something better i could use?
[15:27:36] <ryanneufeld> if you compare two similar tests one using context the other using find you can see
[15:35:08] <redflame> float plugin?
[15:35:14] <redflame> flot plugin
[15:35:19] <redflame> ? anyone?
[15:35:22] <bot-t> redflame, vote | jQuery Plugins - The plugin creates a vote up/down widget. Depends on the jQuery Corner Plugin . Uses the jQuery-ui themes . More information at the Plugin Page . http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/vote
[15:36:06] <redflame> any one used flot plugin?
[15:36:16] <redflame> I have some problems with it.
[15:37:39] <redflame> anyone,anyone??don't be ashamed if you don't know.
[15:38:01] <redflame> bye and bye makes me cry
[15:41:49] <rtraction> redflame: no clue. not ashamed though.
[15:45:18] <redflame> rtraction:but according to rule,ashamed event should triggered inside your mind().
[15:46:16] <rtraction> lol
[15:51:15] <Phoenixz> Any reason why $('#id').submit(function(e){}); would work on chrome, but not on firefox?
[15:55:52] <maxownz> Phoenixz: anything more to it?
[16:19:24] <luxigo> Phoenixz: you could just $('#id').bind('click') instead
[16:21:12] <Pio> http://pastebin.com/YDgR1FgJ  the table gets created, but the append() doesnt seem to add anything.. no javascript exceptions in the console.. any ideas?
[16:21:41] <Pio> oops bad paste
[16:21:45] <Pio> it cut off the first line..
[16:22:48] <Pio> http://pastebin.com/iMA9Ywvx better
[16:26:19] <luxigo> Pio: .append($('<tr><td>test</td></tr>')); ?
[16:26:35] <luxigo> oh no
[16:27:02] <luxigo> i dont think you can create a tr without a table
[16:27:08] <Pio> i tried to use getElementById and set innerHTML out of curiosity to see if that worked, but it doesnt
[16:27:16] <luxigo> not this way
[16:30:34] <luxigo> maybe try $('table').html($('table').html()+'<tr></tr>') or try document.createElement and appendChild
[16:31:33] <Pio> if i chain .append('test') to the end of the first line, it works
[16:32:06] <Pio> and if i alert($('#xlist_table').attr('id')) i can see its definitely finding it with the selector
[16:32:15] <Pio> but i cant chain append to the selector and have it work
[16:32:19] <Pio> its the weirdest thing
[16:32:36] <luxigo> no it's tbody not table
[16:32:49] <Pio> yeah i'll try tbody
[16:32:54] <luxigo> maybe try $('table tbody').html($('table tbody').html()+'<tr></tr>')
[16:37:53] <Pio> i changed the table id attribute value from 'xlist_table' to 'abc' and it works
[16:38:00] <Pio> is underscore not valid in IDs or selectors?
[16:39:05] <Pio> oh damn, i had another element with the same ID
[16:39:09] * Pio <-- foolish
[16:39:37] <sorens3n> lol
[16:40:53] <Pio> one of those days man heh
[16:42:06] <josefig> Pio, np, I have had those days too :)
[16:42:32] <Pio> yah.. now its working perfectly
[16:58:07] <cgardner> Is there any reason that .html(str) would act like .before(str)?
[17:09:56] <maxownz> cgardner: do you have an example of this happening?
[17:11:26] <cgardner> yeahâ€¦ $('<a>').attr({â€¦}).html('mytitle') gives me mytitle<a></a>
[17:13:36] <cheesecow> does anyone know how to "serialize" a form into an plain object rather then a string?
[17:15:48] <boogyman> cheesecow: you could write your own extension
[17:16:14] <cheesecow> hhmmm ok thanks
[17:17:06] <boogyman> cheesecow: or you can use serializeArray() xD
[17:17:25] <boogyman> http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[17:18:22] <cheesecow> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/serialize-form-to-json/
[17:18:55] <cheesecow> that does the trick but it doesn't do all the magic of nested objects expressed in a[format][][like][this]
[17:19:00] <cheesecow> the rails params format
[17:19:03] <cheesecow> which would be awesome
[17:20:27] <cheesecow> the opposite of this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[17:21:56] <codinghurts> Hey friends! Just trying to attach a session cookie to a Promo Ad animation function with the Jquery cookies plugin. I'm having some trouble with the code. Does anyone have a quick second to take a look?
[17:25:56] <codinghurts> Here's the code I'm having problems with: http://jsfiddle.net/rfnz8/
[17:28:52] <Tobsn> hey, since position() now supports at: of: etc. can i use that with animate()? - i want to float one element over another
[17:40:09] <codinghurts> Hey friends! Just trying to attach a session cookie to a Promo Ad animation function with the Jquery cookies plugin. I'm having some trouble with the code. Does anyone have a quick second to take a look? Code: http://jsfiddle.net/rfnz8/
[17:46:04] <byteme_> I have a cookie for anyone who can help me figure out to take a text box and button and have the click post the values to a hidden input and button and fire the click event of the hidden button
[17:46:58] <byteme_> asp.net application so had to add the newsletter <form> </form>  in a hidden div outside of the form tag of the MasterPage
[17:47:28] <GeoDud> hidden button makes babies cry
[17:48:08] <byteme_> and kittens...and grandmas...I dont know how to get around it
[17:48:35] <GeoDud> $('#myHiddenButton').trigger("click");
[17:48:39] <byteme_> tried posting with ajax but the service is picky about how its sent
[17:50:06] <byteme_> necromancer was my fav class in eq
[17:50:26] * necromancer got it from diablo 2
[17:50:29] <jovrtn> byteme_: what are you trying to accomplish?
[17:50:51] <byteme_> have an email service we were requested to use
[17:50:59] <necromancer> is there a plugin like http://galleria.aino.se/ but which can support multiple galleries?
[17:51:06] <jovrtn> what is fundamentally different about the hidden set of elements versus the visible ones
[17:51:08] <byteme_> the code for this service is a <form>
[17:51:22] <coldhead> gallerific supports multiple galleries but it's not super simple to set up
[17:51:27] <necromancer> i'm basically looking for a jQuery equivalent of http://slideshowpro.net/
[17:51:36] <byteme_> because Im using asp.net I cant put it in the page because Asp.net wraps its entire page in a form tag
[17:51:58] <eddiemonge> byteme_, we solved this yesterday
[17:52:11] <byteme_> until I hid it...eddimonge
[17:52:12] <coldhead> :)
[17:52:18] <byteme_> I wish I wasnt still wrestling with it
[17:52:29] <byteme_> not posting every time
[17:52:34] <eddiemonge> hid it?
[17:52:35] <byteme_> or when hidden
[17:52:42] <coldhead> we all wish that
[17:52:56] <byteme_> wrapped form tag in div and display:none;
[17:52:59] <necromancer> why would you need to "click the button"
[17:53:08] <necromancer> why can't you just do the thing that clicking the button would do
[17:53:29] <jovrtn> byteme_: whipping up a fiddle demo real quick
[17:53:33] <necromancer> also lol...asp.net wraps an entire page in a <form>? who thought that up?
[17:53:33] <byteme_> maybe easier if I show the code
[17:54:02] <byteme_> I think its to emulate their whole postback thing
[17:54:22] <byteme_> post back is just submitting the entire application back to the server...I think anyways
[17:56:23] <vasocreta> Why is it that this script will only return the height of the first element? http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/ghZbw/
[17:57:15] <jovrtn> byteme_: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/gf2aV/
[17:57:18] <chrislabeard> What is a slideshow called that has the main screen and then a list next to it of the items as teasers?
[17:57:31] <vasocreta> thumbnials?
[17:57:35] <chrislabeard> like this http://demo.wpzoom.com/?theme=monograph
[17:58:02] <byteme_> http://jsfiddle.net/TBWRA/2/
[17:58:15] <byteme_> please excuse the crap...been testing over and over
[17:58:20] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, because thats how height works
[17:59:34] <vasocreta> hmmm. so I want to explicitly write in the height for each element. Gotta learn to do that.
[17:59:40] <byteme_> I need to probably post their code in a plain html page and watch fiddler
[17:59:42] <SkyFlyer> question:  I have a click event bind to a div, however i also have a draggable.  but if I click and drag, the click event won't get fired ? any idea on what to do ?
[17:59:45] <byteme_> or whatever its called
[18:00:16] <byteme_> maybe I can figure out how to do it with ajax or json
[18:00:44] <jovrtn> SkyFlyer: you can add some logic to the click event to see whether it's being dragged; if not, fire the normal click, if so, return false
[18:00:56] <jovrtn> perhaps check for a UI draggable class on the div or something simple
[18:01:06] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, loop through them
[18:01:08] <jovrtn> or is-being-dragged or whatever the actual class is
[18:01:35] <vasocreta> eddie. I though that load() did that. I must have misinterpreted something.
[18:04:22] <eddiemonge> what are you trying to do?
[18:07:16] <vasocreta> eddiemonge: I am writing a script that gets the height of an image, then the height its parent container, does math and then sets a top-margin on the image to make it center vertically
[18:07:57] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, you need to be doing $(this) inside the .load then to operate on each img
[18:08:48] <vasocreta> eddiemonge: like this, you mean: http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/ghZbw/1/
[18:09:02] <vasocreta> I know what I have is wrong so far...still getting there.
[18:09:54] <eddiemonge> why are you setting the height from itself?
[18:10:41] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, why dont you set a height on the parent and then display: table-cell on the img and vertical-align middle?
[18:10:50] <vasocreta> I am just trying to first return the value. I wanted to make sure it was returning the right value
[18:11:25] <vasocreta> cannot set display: table-cell on the container with this slideshow.
[18:11:49] <byteme_> thanks jovrtn
[18:11:51] <byteme_> worked
[18:11:58] <jovrtn> np
[18:12:26] <byteme_> thinking I need to spend time getting to know jquery better
[18:14:12] <eddiemonge> vasocreta, http://jsfiddle.net/ghZbw/2/
[18:14:36] <codinghurts> Trying to attach a session cookie to a Promo Ad animation function with the Jquery cookies plugin. I'm having some trouble with the code. Does anyone have a quick second to take a look? Code: http://jsfiddle.net/rfnz8/
[18:14:53] <sholmes> Is it alright to hotlink to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.min.js for the latest release?
[18:15:52] <eddiemonge> sholmes, yes
[18:16:06] <vasocreta> eddiemonge: thx. i will give it a try
[18:16:28] <sholmes> eddiemonge: wasn't there a google link before?
[18:17:12] <eddiemonge> sholmes, theres a few cdns
[18:17:38] <sholmes> Which one do I use?
[18:19:43] <eddiemonge> sholmes, whichever you want
[18:46:53] <sphinxx> why is my for loop here not doing anything? http://jsfiddle.net/Lq3xp/
[18:47:27] <rukubites> I have a question on jqueryui: All the events have e.g. selected: function(event, ui) { ... }, but I can't find any documentation on what the event and ui objects are. Any help on documentation?
[18:51:48] <shiawuen> sphinxx: there is nothing in the container
[18:53:12] <vasocreta> so I am having an idiot day. I blame the new baby. Anyway. http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/ghZbw/3/  this is not working well. First it skips the first few images. Next, my math is off, I think.
[18:53:14] <sphinxx> but i even try alerting it and the alert doesnt show up
[19:09:12] <onFilm> What would you guys recommend as an alternative to hash links? php includes and such?
[19:09:22] <onFilm> to unique urls?
[19:09:32] <jlazaroff> onFilm: what do you mean?
[19:10:05] <onFilm> rather than using domain.com/#blabla.html links, whats a better way to have content stored?
[19:10:43] <onFilm> without having to rely on jquery/javascript
[19:12:17] <Guest20840> what do you mean by has links?
[19:13:04] <onFilm> hash links, not has
[19:13:10] <onFilm> # = hash
[19:14:18] <Guest20840> can you give an example of one? and where you use it?
[19:14:18] <jlazaroff> onFilm: i don't understand the question, domain.com/#blabla.html will jump you to an element with the id #blabla.html on the page domain.com/
[19:14:27] <jlazaroff> the server doesn't see anything past the hashtag
[19:14:35] <jlazaroff> er, hash sign
[19:14:38] <jlazaroff> too much twitter -_________-
[19:14:53] <onFilm> Yes, I'm aware
[19:15:04] <onFilm> thus why I want to know of an alternative solution to having to hide/show div content
[19:15:18] <jlazaroff> onFilm: you can either rely on javascript, or load a separate page
[19:16:30] <Guest20840> i do not know of one either
[19:19:12] <mastarish> i am curious to know is there is anyway to prevent scripts from running when a page loads document onload/ready?
[19:19:24] <mastarish> I assume not possible be any chance there are hacks/work arounds?
[19:21:37] <jlazaroff> mastarish: what are you trying to do?
[19:34:31] <mastarish> jlazaroff: trying to have a script at the top of a head file that would stop all scripts from running int he browser, thus stop all statements in js files from executing
[19:34:49] <mastarish> jlazaroff: just messing around just wanna see if possible
[19:35:24] <jlazaroff> mastarish: the only thing i can think to try would be to remove the script tags from the DOM, but that's a weird thing to want to do.  why are you trying to do that?
[19:35:25] <jlazaroff> g
[19:35:40] <jlazaroff> whoops, didn't mean to send that g
[19:39:48] <mastarish> jlazaroff: I am trying to instrument some js.... wouldn't the scripts have already loaded by then?
[19:41:06] <jlazaroff> mastarish: probably.  you can't really control how your javascript loads.  why are you trying to do this, though?
[19:41:21] <jlazaroff> as opposed to just not having script tags in your head
[19:42:59] <mastarish> i want to make a few changes to the src javascript of various scripts, before they load
[19:43:05] <mastarish> it needs to happen at runtime
[20:01:19] <abjorn> http://soundcloud.com/abjorn/fucking-tocatta-or-some-shit aw yeah a whole 5 minutes spent on this, so much work
[20:08:22] <NateDawg> hey, wondering if anyone could help me with a jquery plugin, uploadify
[20:09:35] <gf3> NateDawg: uh oh
[20:09:56] <NateDawg> ?
[20:10:07] <gf3> uploadify is trouble
[20:10:13] <NateDawg> ah
[20:10:35] <abjorn> lol
[20:10:38] <NateDawg> could you suggest a better upload script that would work with jcrop
[20:11:04] <wkmanire> abjorn: Did you play this?
[20:11:10] <abjorn> yeah
[20:11:16] <wkmanire> playing with pedals eh?
[20:11:22] <abjorn> whatchya mean
[20:11:35] <wkmanire> overdrive effects pedals I mean
[20:11:44] <abjorn> no i just always put much more overdrive than most people
[20:11:46] <abjorn> because why the fuck not
[20:12:01] <wkmanire> not bad :)
[20:12:06] <abjorn> I actually ran this through a Line 6 POD GX rather than any pedals
[20:12:11] <NateDawg> keep going round and round
[20:13:05] <abjorn> wkmanire: I can't tell you how many times I've recorded Tocatta and Fugue just because I was bored. I'm never satisfied with it when I do either
[20:13:14] <KWhat_Mobile> are the jquery ui css items defined somewhere?  IE what is a ui-widget ?
[20:13:37] <wkmanire> You do just fine.
[20:13:39] <abjorn> uhm...defined in the css file I would imagine?
[20:13:44] <abjorn> unless you mean something else
[20:13:58] <wkmanire> I've been banging chords on acoustics for years... I can't play anything half that technical.
[20:14:07] <KWhat_Mobile> abjorn: i mean more along the lines of what is a ui-widget
[20:14:25] <KWhat_Mobile> what constitutes a ui-widget
[20:14:44] <abjorn> lol i focused a bit much on technical playing, I think, wkmanire. My playing style isn't very wide ranging, and I know very little music theory
[20:15:11] <abjorn> Well, KWhat_Mobile, if ajpiano is around I'm sure he can tell you, but I'm not sure. I would bet it's in some docs somewhere, though.
[20:15:58] <abjorn> wkmanire: also my mind hasn't exactly caught up with how fast my fingers can move so I get pretty sloppy
[20:16:00] <wkmanire> abjorn, KWhat_Mobile: While technically this is not essential I would imagine that anything which uses the WidgetFactory is a UI widget
[20:17:56] <KWhat_Mobile> wkmanire: whats a WidgetFactory
[20:18:05] <KWhat_Mobile> .widget?
[20:18:14] <wkmanire> ?WidgetFactory

[20:38:19] <jlazaroff> question: how come if i hover quickly over the thumbnails the hover effect doesn't work anymore?  http://jakelazaroff.com/test/

[20:59:47] * crickets chirps
[21:00:54] <athst> jlazaroff does the discussion in comments at the bottom of this help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4177283/jquery-hover-lots-of-times-breaks-javascript
[21:02:08] <vasocreta> can anyone help me figure why this does not: 1) Apply the top-margin to all of the targeted elements 2)not find the height of the img elements?
[21:02:24] <vasocreta> http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/ghZbw/4/
[21:02:28] <vasocreta> the code helps
[21:02:31] <vasocreta> :-)
[21:03:23] <vasocreta> the first 4 or so elements do not get the top-margin applied. But all others after that do
[21:04:08] <coldhead> load must not be firing for those guys?
[21:04:23] <vasocreta> coldhead. Yeah. But I do not get why.
[21:04:26] <coldhead> the load event isn't especially reliable >: \
[21:04:29] <vasocreta> it makes no sense
[21:04:50] <vasocreta> is there another option?
[21:04:57] <jlazaroff> athst: yes it does!  thanks a lot :)
[21:05:26] <coldhead> vasocreta: http://jsfiddle.net/ghZbw/5/
[21:05:32] <coldhead> i would try something like that
[21:05:42] <coldhead> it might run multiple times but it should get everything
[21:06:39] <vasocreta> grrr. still no go. Crazy.
[21:07:21] <coldhead> vasocreta: maybe try console.log(this) inside the function to see how often it fires?
[21:07:30] <vasocreta> the other issue is that it is not grabbing the $this.height(). I have checked my selectors and they are correct.
[21:07:38] <coldhead> i can't remember why load() hurts, maybe it's cacheing
[21:07:50] <vasocreta> good call
[21:08:03] <vasocreta> trying console.log
[21:08:04] <coldhead> try console.log($this.height()), too, and see what the hell
[21:08:17] <gnarf> vasocreta: is the element hidden / off dom ?
[21:08:36] <gnarf> actually
[21:08:46] <vasocreta> yes. It is part of a slideshow.
[21:09:03] <vasocreta> display is none
[21:09:05] <gnarf> vasocreta: you can't get .height() of a hidden element reliably
[21:09:11] <vasocreta> grrrr
[21:09:16] <coldhead> booyah
[21:09:20] <gnarf> vasocreta: why do you need it?
[21:09:50] <vasocreta> ok, so I am using the cycle plugin. And I need to vertically align the images in the show to middle
[21:10:28] <vasocreta> so, I was trying to do the whole grab the height of the image, grab the height of the container, do math, apply top-margin to image
[21:11:51] <coldhead> i would center them horizontally with margin: auto and then css rotate the container by 90 degrees
[21:11:54] <coldhead> easy
[21:11:58] <coldhead> (i wouldn't really)
[21:12:15] <gnarf> vasocreta: http://jsfiddle.net/ghZbw/6/
[21:12:22] <vasocreta> I have the horizontal center down. That was easy. The vertical is killing me
[21:12:23] <gnarf> you can center a background image REALLY easily
[21:13:16] <vasocreta> gnarf: good pic
[21:13:32] <vasocreta> and nice idea. I may have to run with it. My way is not working.
[21:14:03] <vasocreta> but can I reliably apply the bg image to <li>s that are hidden?
[21:14:18] <gnarf> yeah, do something like... (fiddling)

[21:17:42] <onFilm> I'm using jquery.scrollTo and for some reason when the page scrolls to the top it gets stuck and won't allow me to scroll down
[21:17:54] <vasocreta> gnarf: testing
[21:21:08] <coldhead> ?p @ onFilm
[21:21:08] <bot-t> onFilm, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[21:21:19] <coldhead> as you intui it's not supposed to work like that
[21:21:21] <coldhead> intui*
[21:21:25] <coldhead> INTUIT**
[21:21:28] <coldhead> GUH
[21:22:59] <vasocreta> gnarf: Shit. It works. But then it kills the thumbnails (should have anticipated that) since the thumbnails are built from those images.
[21:23:11] <vasocreta> but your code works nice ;-)
[21:23:21] <gnarf> you could .hide() the img instead of .remove()
[21:24:02] <vasocreta> ooooo. I think I am too tired to be smart today. This is why they pay oyu the big bucks, huh?
[21:24:50] <vasocreta> dude. If you were a chick, I'd kiss ya.
[21:24:57] <vasocreta> *Man hug*
[21:25:16] <gnarf> i could be for you... ;)
[21:26:01] <gf3> pew pew
[21:26:08] <vasocreta> well, since its virtual...your code is sexy.
[21:26:13] <vasocreta> lol
[21:26:34] <gnarf> gotta run

[21:32:04] * abjorn flexes
[21:32:07] <psilo2> I work at fleshlight in austin
[21:32:12] <abjorn> you what?
[21:32:23] <abjorn> you work at uh...really now..uhm okay
[21:32:34] <psilo2> php/js/IT it's fun :)
[21:32:41] <coldhead> maybe he wants to watch you wiggle with a fleshlight
[21:32:44] <coldhead> stranger things...
[21:32:47] <abjorn> lmfao coldhead
[21:33:30] <psilo2> hey, sex sells.  so they have money to hire talented and smart people, I get to work with a pretty sweet crew :)  content notwithstanding.
[21:33:33] <abjorn> I wasn't even aware there was an office for that here...then again I guess the only reason I even know what fleshlight is is because of intrusive ads
[21:35:11] <abjorn> lol i guess so psilo2...I was just...not expecting that lol
[21:35:19] <abjorn> I just got a job at HostGator
[21:37:12] <monokrome> They make me mad.
[21:37:17] <abjorn> HostGator?
[21:37:29] <monokrome> Yep.
[21:37:56] <abjorn> Man, I would laugh every time I passed by that porno store on 183, psilo2, and on the big sign it would say "FLESHLIGHTS ARE HERE. MILITARY DISCOUNT"
[21:38:10] <abjorn> monokrome: yeah you wouldn't be the first to tell me that lol
[21:38:13] <abjorn> I never have an issue though
[21:38:19] <abjorn> although technically i use a hostgator reseller
[21:40:28] <psilo2> abjorn: which one never seen it?  I assume Dreamers
[21:40:38] <abjorn> uh, no that like
[21:40:41] <abjorn> "NEWS" or whatever
[21:40:50] <Hierofant> Hey all.  I'd like to set up my own blog with a simple CMS that I maybe could mod with jquery later.  Any recs?
[21:41:01] <abjorn> wordpress
[21:41:07] <Hierofant> thats still the king eh
[21:41:08] <Hierofant> ok
[21:41:18] <abjorn> no reason to use anything else tbh
[21:41:30] <abjorn> at least not if you intend to use it mainly as a blog
[21:54:34] <jlazaroff> could someone help me figure out why these animations (if you click one of the icons on the top right) seem to be so laggy?  http://jakelazaroff.com/test/
[22:21:03] <Shai-Tan> I have a group of dropdowns. each has an ID like comm_1 comm_2 comm_3 etc I have an onChange and I want to get the ID of the select changed. How do I get this value?
[22:32:52] <Shai-Tan> tap tap tap, is this thing on?
[22:33:47] <LearnerJq> what is the best form validation plugin in jquery?
[22:35:14] <ryanseddon> Shai-Tan: $(this) within the event callback will refer to the current element that the event triggered on
[23:02:50] <Shai-Tan> I have var femdId = $(this).attr("id"); and that works no probs, now I wish to do something like var commTypeId = $(femdId).val();
[23:02:57] <Shai-Tan> to get the value of the femdId
[23:06:08] <coldhead> $(femdId).attr('id')
[23:06:20] <coldhead> Shai-Tan: ^^
[23:07:05] <Shai-Tan> ooh, will give that a whirl
[23:08:25] <Shai-Tan> var commTypeId = $(femdId).attr('id'); alert( commTypeId );
[23:08:27] <Shai-Tan> undefined
[23:08:41] <coldhead> that shouldn't ve so
[23:08:43] <coldhead> be*
[23:08:47] <coldhead> as i will demonstrate
[23:09:33] <Shai-Tan> this is to get the value of the option that is select from teh particular dropdown
[23:10:42] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/tSWNK/
[23:10:45] <coldhead> ah, so not like that
[23:10:56] <coldhead> you do want val() then, i suspect
[23:11:04] <coldhead> IDs don't come into it?
[23:11:07] <coldhead> i'm guessing
[23:11:14] <coldhead> paste your html on jsfiddle
[23:11:23] <Shai-Tan> I guess the val()

[23:15:27] <coldhead> oh god
[23:15:33] <coldhead> onchange=?
[23:15:50] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[23:16:56] <coldhead> this isn't a good way to do this, Shai-Tan
[23:17:05] <coldhead> all this _7 business and onchange
[23:17:09] <coldhead> too much code
[23:17:15] <coldhead> can you explain how it's supposed to work?
[23:17:28] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: no, an $(function() { $("comm_type_2").change(function () { alert("eep"); }); }) would be better, but I am just learning, working towards it
[23:17:47] <coldhead> the sooner you do it that way the better :)
[23:18:15] <wkmanire> So I was just playing a game on my XBOX, multiplayer, with some kids and other adults. The two kids were screaming at eachother arguments, in between racial slurs, which person was more hardcore and listing illegal drugs that they habitually use.
[23:18:29] <wkmanire> They were maybe 15 or 16... I'm fairly certain the world is doomed.
[23:18:43] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: my issue was with the id's of the selects, I can give them a class, and I am not sure how to get the id of the select, and the value of the selected option
[23:18:59] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: sec, I will change the code
[23:19:50] <coldhead> Shai-Tan: http://jsfiddle.net/6RTtb/2/
[23:19:59] <coldhead> is that what you need?
[23:20:23] <Shai-Tan> yup :)
[23:20:55] <Shai-Tan> I will get rid of the onchange and use the other way
[23:21:11] <coldhead> yay!
[23:21:20] <coldhead> that makes puppies and kittens very happy
[23:21:39] <wkmanire> coldhead: Puppies and kittens?
[23:23:04] <athst> wkman just be glad those people are playing xbox all day and nothing else
[23:23:06] <coldhead> everytime you use onchange in your HTML a puppy and a kitten are crucified
[23:23:16] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: should this go in jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ??
[23:23:18] <wkmanire> athst: No kidding.
[23:23:37] <coldhead> yes, Shai-Tan
[23:24:21] <coldhead> i used illegal drugs at that age and i turned out okay
[23:24:34] <coldhead> its obviously the racism that is gonna doom us
[23:25:16] <coldhead> hmm, maybe i didn't turn out okay
[23:25:17] <wkmanire> Not so much the drugs that bother me, its the willingness to brag about being a criminal on a paid gaming account.
[23:25:22] <wkmanire> Its the stupiditiy.
[23:25:28] <wkmanire> stupidity*
[23:25:29] <wkmanire> he he
[23:25:48] * wkmanire smiles at how wonderfully ironic that typo was.
[23:26:13] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: ok, now I have http://jsfiddle.net/mfLBL/ working
[23:27:31] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: thanks for your time/help
[23:28:15] <Shai-Tan> now.. to make and ajaxy call to update the db
[23:28:20] <coldhead> you are welcome, Shai-Tan
[23:28:26] <coldhead> good luck!

[23:28:56] <wkmanire> Then again we have professional politicians getting caught with their pants down on twitter....
[23:29:04] <wkmanire> Hard to be critical of the kids I suppose.
[23:29:11] <coldhead> hahahah
[23:29:27] <coldhead> i bet that politician lead those poor kids astray
[23:31:14] <wkmanire> No, Weiner just boned himself.

[23:46:38] <darktemplate> hi
[23:48:25] <darktemplate> how can I use keydown event only once ?
[23:49:46] <darktemplate> I have textarea and submit button. Submit button is disabled by default. When user type smth into textarea submit become eneble. If textarea is empte - submit must be disable
[23:50:36] <darktemplate> if i bind keydown event for my text area - it will check submit button all the time when user are typing
[23:51:12] <darktemplate> is there any way to run my event only once ?
[23:52:16] <mazzachre> OK, I have started development of my widget as a jQuery UI widget, and I was wondering, all the data and loads of the work is done in exchange with the backend via ajax, should I implement all the ajax calls inside the widget or should I give it callbacks in init to do the data transfering?
[23:52:55] <wkmanire> darktemplate: yes
[23:53:33] <wkmanire> darktemplate: The logic may get a little complex.
[23:54:18] <wkmanire> darktemplate: Why is it a problem to check the contents on every key event though?
[23:55:18] <wkmanire> mazzachre: What does your widget do?
[23:55:30] <darktemplate> i'm not sure ... but i think it's not good for performance
[23:56:09] <wkmanire> darktemplate: It usually does not cause a problem. Generally this kind of logic is implemented for keyup and blur events to make sure you cover all of the possibilities.
[23:56:31] <darktemplate> keyup ?
[23:57:08] <darktemplate> should I use keyup, or keydown ? Or it doesn't matter ?
[23:57:16] <wkmanire> $( "#myInput" ).keyup( myCallback ).blur( myCallback );
[23:57:37] <wkmanire> I prefer keyup because it is the last key event to fire before the text is actually entered into the input/textarea.
[23:57:58] <wkmanire> But it probably doesn't matter all that much.
[23:58:25] <mazzachre> wkmanire: It is a customer management widget... Quiet specific to our organization, it is included in our administration frontends for different products.
[23:59:03] <wkmanire> mazzachre: In that case, do you anticipate that the widget will be used in many different places by many different devs?
[23:59:45] <phrearch>  /join #css
[23:59:54] <wkmanire> phrearch: Fail :D
