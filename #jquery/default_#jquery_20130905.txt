[00:12:07] <dblosevn> Jac0bz1: untested but something like this may work... var newElem = $(elem).clone(); newElem.name = newElem.name.match(/\[[0-9]+\]$/)[1]++;

[00:15:18] <dev2b> hi
[00:15:42] <dev2b> I have this problem.... I perform an ajax request to the server
[00:16:14] <dev2b> I get the json objects, in this case, the post of my blog
[00:16:25] <dev2b> every post
[00:17:40] <dev2b> how can I get to open any post in a new page?
[00:18:03] <dev2b> I mean... I have all the post's headlines in my index.html
[00:18:12] <Cork> dev2b: you can't really show responses from ajax in a new tab/page
[00:18:37] <dev2b> and what I want, is to click in the headline an get a new page with the full post
[00:18:44] <Cork> well you can, but you will trigger the popup blocker in the browser
[00:19:08] <Cork> dev2b: have it as a normal link, and have the server send a full page
[00:19:18] <Cork> use target="_blank"
[00:19:41] <Cork> if you want to solve it without server actions, do it inpage
[00:20:37] <thmcmahon> exit
[00:21:14] <dev2b> any example of that?
[00:22:52] <Cork> dev2b: example of what?
[00:25:57] <dev2b> I have the following code... $.ajax ( type: 'get', datatype: 'json', url: 'myapp.php', success: function (data){ //sth here})
[00:26:37] <dev2b> with that request I get every post of my blog
[00:30:36] <zhulikas> hey fellas
[00:30:43] <zhulikas> looking for a jquery grid plugin
[00:30:59] <zhulikas> which would let me do data manipulation with submitting data back to server
[00:31:15] <Cork> zhulikas: have a look at jqgrid
[00:32:52] <zhulikas> jqGrid supports creating a form ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù
[00:32:55] <zhulikas> that's what pqgrid is missing
[00:33:29] <dev2b> I had $.each(data function(entryIndex, entry) { var html = '<div class="headline">'; html += entry.['title'] + '</div>'; $('#posts').append(html);}
[00:33:31] <zhulikas> ah, perfect
[00:33:39] <zhulikas> form editing + afterComplete event, which could let me post data to server
[00:41:11] <fat> my menu was working perfectly fine, but when i added a tab function to my site, it the li class active stopped working. please help http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/16/
[00:43:11] <fat> please help someone
[00:49:35] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/17/
[00:49:54] <fat> cork: my tabs don't work now.
[00:50:58] <Cork> fat: well it's cause you clear the tab state when you click a link in the list
[00:51:20] <fat> cork: do you know how to fix this?
[00:51:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/18/
[00:52:14] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/19/
[00:53:02] <fat> thank you so much
[00:55:04] <xec> fat: it makes more sense if you write it something like this though; http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/20/
[00:55:06] <Cork> fat: not sure but this might be what you're looking for http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/21/
[00:55:22] <fat> xec: oh ok
[00:55:37] <fat> cork: thank you
[00:55:49] <fat> xec: /20 is working
[00:56:02] <Cork> that way you can handle both the tab and list with the same handler
[00:56:27] <xec> Cork: the tab is part of bootstrap or something i think
[00:56:45] <Cork> xec: well clicking them doesn't have any effect without the change though
[00:56:59] <xec> Cork: with no javascript, the tabs will work
[00:57:39] <xec> Cork: it messes with the tabs because all li's were selected, rather than just the ones under .nav-li
[00:57:45] <xec> .nav-list*
[00:57:59] <Cork> xec: no i changed that in 18
[00:58:11] <Cork> and that broke the tabs
[00:58:36] <Cork> 19 an 20 has the same problem
[00:58:47] <xec> Cork: .on('click', 'li a', will still apply to the tabs though, and $(this).parent() ...
[00:59:47] <Cork> xec: still broken http://jsfiddle.net/h4tZN/22/
[01:00:05] <Cork> opps read the code wrong
[01:00:14] <Cork> xec: if that was the problem 20 would have worked
[01:00:25] <xec> it does?
[01:00:34] <Cork> xec: but if you click the tabs in /20 nothing happens
[01:00:42] <xec> yes it does
[01:01:11] <Cork> ...
[01:01:23] <Cork> nice i didn't load a needed script
[01:01:26] <Cork> *move along...*
[01:08:57] <bove> Is the ajaxForm plugin part of jquery?
[01:10:03] <alpic> bove: whats the exact question ?
[01:10:43] <xec> bove: no
[01:11:01] <xec> the term "plugin" implies that it's... a plugin.
[01:11:34] * xec picks his nose
[01:12:08] <Cork> :D
[01:21:03] <notbenj> hi all
[01:21:43] <bove> Should/can I avoid the whole submit event when I want to send a form as POST using ajax?
[01:22:04] <notbenj> I use a library that updates an input field programmatically. I'd like to know when this field is updated programmatically, but the library is not triggering the "change" event. Do you know if there's a way to do it?
[01:22:54] <anli> Seems like when I use datatables and access oObj.aData in a fnRender handler, the data has gone through a fnRender filter, so I cannot get the raw version
[01:23:10] <anli> Anyone else that have experienced that?
[01:23:52] <Cork> bove: you can, but you would break things in the browser if you do
[01:24:02] <Cork> bove: so, yes you can, but you should never do it
[01:24:48] <bove> Cork: Every jquery article on ajax forms seems to involve serializing and sending as GET
[01:25:15] <Cork> bove: is the question about using submit events on a form or about the ajax part?
[01:26:33] <mazzachre> Hmmm... spent yesterday debugging a script that behaved irradicaly... And the problem... In one custom event handler, an element was .remove()d instead of .detach()ed and later reinserted and so some of it's handlers were obviously missing... gawd..
[01:27:02] <Cork> mazzachre: lovely :)
[01:27:10] <bove> Cork: The submit event works fine with non-ajax post, so I guess it's an ajax problem ....
[01:27:42] <Cork> bove: if you use get or post is just how the data is attached to the request
[01:27:47] <BioMonday> hello
[01:28:09] <mazzachre> Cork: That just took so long to find...
[01:28:46] <Cork> mazzachre: http://icant.co.uk/talks/jsconfeu2011/img/patontheback.png
[01:29:24] <mazzachre> lololol
[01:29:25] <bove> Cork: There might be some crazy characters in these forms, but I guess the serialize encoding should solve that?
[01:29:37] <Cork> yes
[01:33:02] <anli> Seems like in datatables, if I want a raw version of oObj.aData[n], meaning that it has not be translated with fnRender yet, and where n is less than the column index of the current columns (the one just fnRendered), I have to save the contents of oObj.aData[n], when column n is rendered
[01:34:18] <anli> In other words, I want unaltered data in a fnRender function for a previous column
[01:50:54] <BioMonday> I havae a script that works on chrome , Firefox and Opera but not on IE 10, but that is in compatibility mode for IE8
[01:52:56] <slax0r> good for you!
[01:53:24] <airdem> is there any opposite method to serialize?
[01:54:40] <slax0r> airdem, you could stringify to json and parse it later
[01:55:16] <slax0r> or use this plugin: https://github.com/kflorence/jquery-deserialize
[01:55:19] <slax0r> not sure how it works tho
[01:57:52] <airdem> slax0r, stringify to json?
[01:58:32] <airdem> JSON.stringify("Start.php?action=showUser&label=all&status=active&billing=all&subUser=0&letter=all&limit=3&page=1&ajax=true")
[01:58:39] <airdem> that would just return the string wouldnt it?
[01:59:43] <slax0r> I meant instead of using serialize, stringify it to json
[02:00:10] <airdem> slacko_, im not using serialize
[02:00:15] <airdem> slax0r,
[02:00:29] <airdem> i just want to use the opposite :P
[02:01:00] <Cork> airdem: so you want to parse params?
[02:01:05] <slax0r> then take a look at the plugin I linked
[02:01:26] <airdem> slax0r, that plugin does populate a form and stuff, i just want to get an array back
[02:01:29] <airdem> Cork, yeah
[02:02:08] <Cork> airdem: deparam then
[02:02:10] <Cork> (plugin)
[02:02:29] <airdem> thank you, taking a look now
[02:02:34] <Cork> or https://gist.github.com/kares/956897
[02:02:57] <Cork> https://github.com/chrissrogers/jquery-deparam
[02:02:57] <airdem> param and serialize, is there any difference?
[02:03:01] <Cork> yes
[02:03:20] <Cork> serialize it to convert a from to an array, and then convert that array to params
[02:03:38] <Cork> $.params (native) conterts arrays to params
[02:04:08] <airdem> ok, then i was using the wrong terminology, thank you for clarifying
[02:04:53] <Cork> basically serialize runs $.params($.serializeArray(form))
[02:06:13] <Cork> bah sorry it's $.param not $.params
[02:06:23] <Cork> airdem: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/serialize.js#L16
[02:15:27] <delboy1978uk> if i have a bunch of <a> tags within a <div>, how would i get the currently selected ones count? ie 3rd <a> within the <div>
[02:15:48] <Cork> delboy1978uk: $(this).index()
[02:16:09] <Cork> i expect you mean clicked or focused by "selected"
[02:16:22] <delboy1978uk> simple as that lol? cheers cork!
[02:21:27] <clarkk> how do people here decide what pieces of code they leave in the html document, and which they move to a separate .js file?
[02:21:48] <Cork> clarkk: you should normally move all js to external files
[02:22:20] <clarkk> Cork: are there any exceptions? Can you think of any reasons why people leave them in the html fle?
[02:22:22] <clarkk> file
[02:22:57] <Cork> clarkk: cms, or to have the server script modify the js
[02:28:41] <clarkk> Cork: sorry for the delay. Could you explain those, please?  I'm afraid I don't understand
[02:29:16] <Cork> clarkk: if you have for example php rules that modify your js you can't have it in an external js file
[02:29:25] <Cork> clarkk: though you shouldn't have to have that so...
[02:29:40] <Cork> and cms can sometimes be hard to have external scripts for a section
[02:31:05] <clarkk> Cork: ok, I don't think I am in risk of having those issues. Thank you very much for the explanations
[02:31:39] <Cork> clarkk: basically there is rarely a legitimate reason to have js inline
[02:31:54] <_pingu> I have several pages with a select tag. These pages always scroll to their select, when they are loaded. How can I deactivate that?
[02:31:57] <Cork> and it is often laziness causing it
[02:32:14] <clarkk> cool Cork - I won't do it from now on ;)
[02:32:21] <Cork> _pingu: have another element have the focus
[02:32:31] <vshjxyz> hello, has anyone any experience on jquery mobile 1.3.0 with the panel widget =?
[02:33:30] <_pingu> Cork: has a select tag per default focus?
[02:33:50] <Cork> _pingu: the first form element per default have focus yes
[02:34:26] <Cork> or more precisely, the first form element in the first form has focus by default
[02:37:51] <_pingu> Cork: ah, ok. how can i deactivate that? i can see nothing about focus here: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
[02:38:19] <Cork> _pingu: don't use w3schools
[02:38:23] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[02:38:24] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools ‚Äì A W3Schools Intervention ‚Üí http://www.w3fools.com/
[02:38:45] <Cork> _pingu: and you can't prevent it, it is how browsers work by default
[02:39:08] <Cork> _pingu: you might be able to work around it by having an element at the beginning of the page that can have focus
[02:39:19] <Cork> <div tabindex="0"></div>
[02:40:12] <MACscr> If i wanted to get the value of the closest attribute named qid, would it be something like so? var qid = $(this).closest().attr('qid');
[02:40:21] <MACscr> i know im missing something simple
[02:40:34] <MACscr> i havent been doing any js/jquery for a couple of months
[02:40:34] <Cork> MACscr: closest only looks at closest parent
[02:40:43] <Cork> you didn't say if that is your target
[02:40:46] <MACscr> yes, i want it to only traverse up the dom
[02:41:08] <Cork> so you want the closest parent with the attribute qid?
[02:41:10] <_pingu> Cork: Ok, I have to think about that. Thanks so far!
[02:41:12] <MACscr> yes
[02:41:24] <airdem> $('#ajax').load(url + ' #ajax'); results in <div id="ajax"><div id="ajax">stuff</div></div> how do i prevent that?
[02:41:30] <Cork> MACscr: $(this).closest('[qid]')
[02:41:51] <MACscr> Cork: sry, i actually need the value of that attribute
[02:41:54] <Cork> airdem: use a container for the element
[02:42:04] <Cork> MACscr: $(this).closest('[qid]').attr('qid')
[02:42:11] <Cork> MACscr:or  $(this).closest('[qid]').prop('qid')
[02:42:13] <MACscr> what do the brackets do?
[02:42:22] <airdem> Cork, but #ajax is my container :)
[02:42:24] <Cork> it finds the element with the qid attribute
[02:42:34] <Cork> airdem: no it is the element
[02:42:46] <Cork> airdem: load loads the target element into the container
[02:42:59] <Cork> airdem: if you want to use the load hack you need to have a container
[02:43:17] <airdem> Cork, any way to strip one <div id="ajax"> ?
[02:43:50] <Cork> airdem: 1. use partials server side instead of loading the entire page every time, 2. use a normal $.get and do the parsing your self
[02:44:26] <Cork> airdem: but really if you need a selector in the url, you are doing server side work client side
[02:44:38] <_pingu> Cork: Where can I read about the default focus behaviour of forms?
[02:44:42] <Cork> and waste bandwith cause of it
[02:44:56] <Cork> _pingu: it isn't exactly about forms, it is how browser works
[02:45:32] <Cork> _pingu: though i'm not sure that scrolling focused elements into view is standard
[02:46:21] <Cork> _pingu: and this is just from historical experience, i don't have any dock to point to
[02:46:58] <Cork> but browsers are free to do what they see fit with the focus things
[02:47:07] <Cork> it is a bit of a mess
[02:52:02] <MACscr> Cork: Thanks! Got one last issue if you got a second. I have stored that qid element (not the value) in a variable named q_section. I now want to find a child paragraph element with class of "steps" and show it. This is my test code: http://jsfiddle.net/uEpba/
[02:52:10] <MACscr> er, just a second
[02:52:30] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/uEpba/1/
[02:52:41] <MACscr> ok, so it should show for the first question because its value is less than 3
[02:52:48] <MACscr> less or equal to
[02:53:11] <MACscr> i dont think im doing line 12 right though
[02:54:45] <Cork> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/uEpba/3/
[02:55:16] <MACscr> ah, makes much more sense
[02:55:18] <MACscr> thanks again so much
[02:55:36] <MACscr> oh, i must be doing something wrong
[02:55:50] <MACscr> as its showing it for both
[02:55:51] <Cork> MACscr: alternatively http://jsfiddle.net/uEpba/4/
[02:56:14] <MACscr> an only 1 of the values is under 3
[02:57:19] <MACscr> as*
[02:59:40] <Cork> MACscr: well both 1 and 2 is smaller then 3
[03:03:22] <MACscr> Cork: huh? the value of the input for the second question is 5
[03:03:32] <MACscr> oh, woops
[03:03:33] <MACscr> lol, my bad
[03:03:35] <MACscr> rofl
[03:03:51] <MACscr> i was testing the wrong variable. Duh
[03:06:15] <larsemil> $('.console-text').animate({scrollTop: $('.console-text')[0].scrollHeight}); this works in chrome but not firefox. any hints on why?

[03:16:16] <Sanj_K> hi
[03:52:40] <zuloyd> hi
[03:53:32] <zuloyd> is it possible to do custom promises stuff? I have a method from the Google Maps API that calls a function asynchronously. Additionally I have an ajax function that should run in parallel. I want to call another method when both the Google Maps and the AJAX request are complete
[03:53:38] <zuloyd> now, I know how to do it with multiple Ajax requests
[03:54:27] <zuloyd> but what about the Google Maps? Can I somehow "signal" something when the request is complete and let jquery wait for signals from the ajax and the google maps reques and call a method when both are complete?
[04:01:03] <shoky> zuloyd: sounds like you wanna use deferreds. e.g.  var mapsDfd = $.Deferred(), mapsReq = mapsDfd.promise();  googlemaps.onRequestCompleted(function() { mapsDfd.resolve() });   var ajaxReq = $.ajax(...);   $.when(mapsReq, ajaxReq).then(function() { ... })

[04:15:24] <sarahm> Hello, do you know if there's some kind of "zip" function for arrays, i've been tryin to do it with loops but im strugglin, here's what i have : https://dpaste.de/7Jj8J/
[04:16:57] <thinced> is there a reason why you are not using multi dimensional arrays?
[04:17:01] <thinced> or objects
[04:17:37] <sarahm> thinced:  ineed arrays because the order is important
[04:18:06] <sarahm> and i don't know in advance how many elements i'll have thats why im not using multidimensional arrays
[04:18:08] <thinced> i would like to understand you more. Why order is important?
[04:18:30] <thinced> how many elements you have? i what manner?
[04:18:54] <thinced> like id, name, age, possible more...
[04:19:56] <sarahm> thinced : yes i'll have a table of a certain number of elements
[04:20:19] <sarahm> thinced: the thing is those elements are fetched from an xml from a remote server
[04:21:04] <sarahm> thinced: and i cant fetch them as a row of id name age etc, i get a list of ids , a list of names , etc
[04:21:47] <thinced> somebody made nasty backend
[04:21:59] <thinced> but taht does not mean that you need to make nasty client
[04:22:40] <thinced> in the xml how the data is linked
[04:22:50] <thinced> with id I suppose
[04:24:02] <thinced> I mean something like this: https://dpaste.de/NWIhO/
[04:25:45] <sarahm> thinced: yep exactly, actually its an event logger, the xml is something like : <event id ="first event"><description>some description</description><time>somedate</time> , etc
[04:30:35] <sarahm> thinced : im sorry but your dpaste is 404
[04:42:22] <titii> I am using hover function on an IMG element to show and hide the magnifier icon over that image. The problem is, when I move mouse over the icon, the hide action proceed. How to solve it?
[04:43:13] <thinced> titii: that does not tell me much
[04:43:15] <titii> I dont want to hide the maginifier over its self
[04:43:40] <Cork> titii: use you could solve that with just css
[04:43:54] <Cork> titii: and in both cases you need a wrapper around the image
[04:44:08] <Cork> bind the :hover or mouseenter/mouseleave on the wrapper
[04:44:10] <Cork> and handle it from there
[04:45:25] <titii> Cork: ok i will try
[04:49:03] <titii> Cork: yea, that works nicely, i try to use also the transition css3 effect on hide and show, it works?
[04:49:15] <Cork> sure
[04:50:57] <titii> Cork: but it seems I need to use opacity. Not display block and none
[04:51:03] <Cork> yes
[04:51:07] <Cork> you can't animate display
[04:51:08] <titii> ok
[04:51:14] <titii> yea
[04:51:17] <titii> thank u
[04:51:22] <Cork> np
[04:53:55] <_pingu> Given is 1 page with a simple select example in a form and another page with another select generated by a framework. it's in a form, too. what could be the reason, that the one page scrolls to the select, and the other does not?
[04:54:30] <Cork> _pingu: link?
[04:56:22] <_pingu> Cork: the first select is the first one of this page: http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~riggs/html/select_example.html.txt the other is only onmy localhost. can i show you something that helps?
[04:56:50] <xqo> hi, im trying to make some pretty sliding, but when i bind slideDown/up to mouseenter/mouseleave, the sliders will slide many times depending on how many times you left/entered. What can I do to stop this behavior?

[04:57:51] <Cork> _pingu: by link i meant examples of the problem
[04:58:18] <Cork> xqo: .stop()
[04:58:51] <xqo> Cork do you have time to show me where to put it, please?
[04:59:07] <Cork> $(this).stop().slide<Direction>(time)
[05:00:05] <_pingu> Cork: WHat do you want to see? html source? The framework stuff wouldnt really help, I guess
[05:00:18] <Cork> _pingu: a rendered page with the problem
[05:01:08] <xqo> Cork when i mouseenter/leave enough times, sliding stops working completely. http://hastebin.com/wofabupeka.coffee
[05:01:19] <_pingu> Cork: You want the html source copied to a pastepin?
[05:01:24] <Cork> no
[05:01:37] * grafi sits back
[05:01:40] <Cork> _pingu: if nothing else recreate the problem in jsfiddle.net
[05:01:52] <_pingu> Cork: Ok.
[05:03:15] <xqo> Cork if i do it fast enough, anyway
[05:04:07] <_pingu> Cork sfiddle does not support my framework. which creates the problematic select.  so i cannot show it.  what would you look for, if you could see it?
[05:04:16] <Cork> xqo: why are you for each:ing around an id?
[05:04:35] <Aric_> How do you remove a keyup binding after establishing it?
[05:04:54] <Cork> _pingu: i would look at the dom structure, and look for events and similar
[05:04:57] <xqo> Cork ok i can fix that. but i dont that will help with the sliding though?
[05:05:07] <Cork> Aric_: off('keyup')
[05:05:41] <Cork> xqo: no it just complicates the code and makes it a bit harder to read
[05:05:57] <xqo> yes sorry ill take care of that. but how about the sliders, hehe..
[05:06:32] <Cork> xqo: could you reproduce the problem in jsfiddle too?
[05:06:33] <Aric_> Cork, TY!
[05:06:45] <Cork> can't see why you would get broken behavior with that code
[05:06:51] <xqo> Cork i can pm you the live url if you want
[05:07:15] <xqo> ?
[05:08:23] <Cork> /mode Cork -g
[05:08:27] <Cork> bah
[05:08:35] <Cork> xqo: go ahead
[05:08:43] <grafi> whats that o√¥
[05:09:05] <Cork> it keeps ppl from pm:ing you about all kind of things
[05:09:12] <Cork> it blocks it on the server
[05:09:36] <grafi> cool
[05:09:49] <grafi> :)
[05:10:30] <Cork> xqo: i see absolutely no animation clicking that button
[05:10:54] <xqo> click the button, then mouseover the little portlet that shows up on the right
[05:11:12] <Cork> no protlet
[05:11:19] <Cork> only thing i get is a page reload
[05:13:00] <xqo> Cork how about now? i gave it a solid red border
[05:14:03] <Cork> "Kj¯p" still doesn't do anything beside a page reload
[05:14:52] <xqo> you dont get this? http://i.imgur.com/mNNuz0Z.jpg
[05:14:53] <xqo> o√ò
[05:15:09] <Cork> sure there is an element with a red border
[05:15:17] <Cork> but what does that have to do with the animation
[05:15:21] <grafi> Mail order bride √¥o
[05:15:25] <grafi> woot
[05:15:27] <Cork> and no it doens't change any value
[05:15:33] <xqo> thats the one with the slides, Cork. if you mouseover the price-indicator there
[05:15:38] <xqo> something will slideDown
[05:16:29] <Cork> xqo: ugg where is the related code?
[05:18:51] <xqo> Cork its the same as the paste
[05:18:57] <Cork> ...
[05:19:15] <Cork> xqo: if i am to help you i need to look at the code running
[05:19:22] <raj> Is `$(document).on('click', ':not(.menu.active, .cornermenu, 'someotherdiv')', closeMenu)` cleaner than using clickoutside event?
[05:19:24] <Cork> static dead code dumps isn't much help there
[05:19:44] <raj> I have multiple clickoutside events going on and I think they're not playing well with each other
[05:20:12] <Cork> raj: depends on how you create the "clickoutside event"
[05:20:20] <xqo> Cork, i dont understand. you'll see the sliding if you mouseenter where it says Handlekurv
[05:20:24] <WrinkledCheese> So IE 10 on Windows 8 with a touch screen doesn't fire mouse up events in all cases.  IE 10 on Windows 7 without a touch screen does.
[05:20:29] <raj> cuz in 1 clickoutside event, I ignore a particular div, but in other clickoutside events I want a function to run, but it's not
[05:20:41] <raj> because I think the other clickoutside event cancels it out
[05:23:35] <sarahm> hello , i have a number of arrays for example array 1 = [ a1,b1,c1) , array2 =[a2,b2,c2] , array 3 =[a3,b3,c3] and i want to zip them in an array of arrays like this array = [[a1,a2,a
[05:24:03] <sarahm> *like this: array = [[a1,a2,a3],[b1,b2,b3]...]
[05:24:15] <sarahm> is there a clean way to do so apart from looping somehow?
[05:25:33] <Cork> sarahm: $.map though it is looping
[05:26:56] <sarahm> Cork:
[05:27:07] <sarahm> Cork: here's how i am doin it for now and its really ugly
[05:27:53] <Cork> raj: well you could get the canceling effect if you use stopPropagation()
[05:28:02] <Cork> raj: else it shouldn't be a problem
[05:29:20] <sarahm> http://bpaste.net/show/nBoN8KFDaHh35KfMS0TD/
[05:31:27] <Cork> sarahm: var events = $.map(ids, function(id, i) { return [id,severities[i],descriptions[i]; });
[05:31:32] <Cork> opps
[05:31:35] <Cork> sarahm: var events = $.map(ids, function(id, i) { return [id,severities[i],descriptions[i]]; });
[05:31:43] <doug65536_> is there a way to make a qUnit asyncTest wait for another to finish, other than nesting it under the test it depends on?
[05:32:08] <Cork> sarahm: now sure why you have event there
[05:32:39] <Cork> sarahm: all it does it duplicate the events in events exponentially
[05:33:21] <sarahm> Cork : well the event is one array of three elems, and events is an array of event arrays , kinda twisted
[05:33:22] <doug65536_> maybe it is better to make each unit test completely non-dependent on order
[05:33:59] <Cork> sarahm: you will add the events from previous loops, plus the new event into and array
[05:33:59] <sarahm> Cork: uf i don't why but the script is not responding, it's not that big of a script
[05:34:07] <Cork> sarahm: and then you push that into the events array
[05:34:24] <jugglinmike> doug65536_: Yeah, if you have multiple asynchronous operations to test, it's best to give them each their own test
[05:34:57] <Cork> sarahm: so you would get something like [[[id,severities,description]],[[id,severities,description],[id,severities,description]],[[id,severities,description],[id,severities,description],[id,severities,description]]] in events
[05:34:58] <sarahm> Cork : yes, but somehow it seems to be too much for the browser, the script isnt runnin
[05:35:26] <Cork> sarahm: from what you said before var events = $.map(ids, function(id, i) { return [id,severities[i],descriptions[i]]; }); sounds like it is what you want
[05:35:38] <sarahm> Cork : yeah that seems like too many arrays, map sounds better
[05:35:44] <Cork> sarahm: most likely cause you exponentially expand the arrays
[05:36:00] <Cork> sarahm: well it would prob work with the old solution is you skipped event
[05:36:16] <Cork> event.push([ids[i],severities[i],descriptions[i]]); will do the same as map
[05:36:22] <Cork> but then you do events.push(event)
[05:36:35] <Cork> and that is where it doesn't make sense any more
[05:36:57] <sarahm> Cork: yeah i though that if i just push into event it will make one single array
[05:37:12] <Cork> sarahm: nope it will push the array into the array
[05:37:12] <sarahm> Cork: but i was clearly wrong
[05:37:28] <Cork> you already create an array there
[05:37:34] <Cork> so no need to wrap it again
[05:37:40] <Cork> (in persistent memory too)
[05:38:02] <sarahm> Cork: yep you're right. uff, even with only the event array the script is stopped :/ i have no idea why
[05:38:10] <doug65536_> jugglinmike: I'm unit testing my user/authentication ajax api. it tests various invalid logins, verifies failure, then tests valid login, then tests things that you can only do as superuser. perhaps it would be best to make each test that requires authentication go through the whole thing? (login/test something/logout)
[05:38:25] <Cork> sarahm: whats the length of ids.length?
[05:39:07] <doug65536_> jugglinmike: the dependency I am referring to is a dependency on being logged in, so my hack was to make it do those tests after login success
[05:39:18] <sarahm> Cork: well for now its just 2
[05:39:40] <Cork> sarahm: and you still get script stopped?!?
[05:39:58] <Cork> sarahm: sounds like you are doing something costly before this in that case
[05:42:22] <sarahm> Cork: well im doin one ajax request to get one xml doc, then im parsin this xml with a different xpath for id, severity and description , and thats it
[05:42:47] <Cork> sarahm: might be worth trying to use css selectors instead then
[05:42:53] <Cork> cause xpath is dead slow
[05:43:55] <sarahm> Cork : yeah i know but i can't, not my decision :/
[05:44:18] <Cork> sarahm: then you might have to break the code up into sections and loop it with setTimeout
[05:44:34] <Cork> to let the browser redraw in the loops
[05:45:10] <Cork> webworkers might also be a possible solution
[05:45:51] <sarahm> Cork: well this is weird because at the end i'll have to make about 5 ajax calls so yeah it surely gonna crash
[05:46:19] <Cork> sarahm: i hope you arn't using sync ajax calls
[05:46:24] <jugglinmike> doug65536_: What you could do
[05:46:36] <jugglinmike> is you could create a "superuser" test module
[05:46:50] <sarahm> Cork: no they're async
[05:47:08] <Cork> sarahm: then the ajax calls shouldn't matter
[05:47:09] <jugglinmike> and write the login code inside that new test module's "setup" method
[05:47:15] <Cork> only the code running when the calls ends
[05:47:36] <doug65536_> jugglinmike: awesome idea! thanks
[05:47:52] <jugglinmike> then you wouldn't have to duplicate the login process across tests (or prevent login-related race conditions)
[05:47:55] <jugglinmike> np
[05:48:01] <sarahm> Cork: ok then its just xml parsin , ill try to make it lighter
[05:48:17] <jugglinmike> since it's async, don't forget to use "stop()" and "start()" in "setup"
[05:48:21] <jugglinmike> doug65536_ ^
[05:49:07] <doug65536_> jugglinmike: ok
[05:49:21] <BioMonday> hello
[05:49:28] <BioMonday> I have an unknown exception at this line // Append to fragment and handle embedded scripts 					fragment.appendChild( elem );
[05:49:35] <BioMonday> when using Internet Explorer
[05:50:08] <BioMonday> line  6406
[05:50:43] <Cork> BioMonday: most likely from something you pass to jquery
[05:50:55] <BioMonday> Cork: why does it work in other browsers?
[05:51:10] <BioMonday> Cork: I don't pass it anything, it's a library that depends on jquery that does
[05:51:10] <Cork> BioMonday: hard to say without knowing what you pass in
[05:51:41] <BioMonday> Cork: a div?
[05:51:54] <Cork> most likely an html string
[05:52:03] <BioMonday> I pass it a dom element
[05:52:29] <Cork> might be you pass in something that ie doens't like in the context
[05:53:00] <BioMonday> Cork: I pass a dom element from a window to a function in window.opener
[05:53:19] <BioMonday> Cork: it works on Firefox, Chrome and Opera
[05:53:23] <Cork> BioMonday: that would sound like something that would cause an exception ya
[05:53:40] <BioMonday> Cork: why does it work on other browsers ? how can I do to fix it?
[05:53:40] <Cork> passing dom elements between documents isn't easy and always safe
[05:53:57] <Cork> cause they handle it, instead of forbidding it
[05:54:08] <BioMonday> I thought it was allowed
[05:54:47] <Cork> BioMonday: there is a long list of things that could cause an action like that to throw an exception
[05:54:51] <Cork> even in the other browsers
[05:55:12] <BioMonday> Cork: so what can I do to find out if it's fixable ?
[05:55:34] <Cork> BioMonday: you would have to dig into what exactly is passed as a start
[05:55:43] <BioMonday> I don't know how to do that :(
[05:55:50] <Cork> and exactly what is happening when the exception occurs
[05:55:54] <krambal> .console it
[05:56:07] <Cork> well you would have to start dissect your own code
[05:56:18] <Cork> and if you use a third party plugin check what it does
[05:56:47] <BioMonday> Cork: I just pass a element to jquery flot, that uses jquery to do plotting and other stuff
[05:56:48] <Cork> when you get to the boundary of jquery you are close enough
[05:56:50] <BioMonday> IDK what it does
[05:57:30] <Cork> BioMonday: well doing it cross browser windows means lots of unkowns
[05:57:33] <Cork> *unknowns
[05:58:30] <BioMonday> what does jquery.clean do?
[05:59:02] <Cork> never heard of it before
[05:59:18] <BioMonday> jQuery.clean( args, context, fragment, scripts ); called from inside BuildFragment
[05:59:24] <BioMonday> that's in the stack call
[05:59:35] <Cork> BioMonday: what version of jquery?
[05:59:46] <quoblerot> How can I make my recaptcha box smaller in width?
[05:59:52] <BioMonday> 1.8.3
[06:01:07] <Cork> BioMonday: line 6288
[06:01:29] <BioMonday> I mean what does it do?
[06:01:46] <Cork> it walks fragments and ensures the fragment wont cause problem when it is inserted in the dom
[06:01:53] <Cork> mainly for ie
[06:02:06] <BioMonday> so this is where I get an exception
[06:02:07] <Cork> (ie < 9(
[06:02:09] <Cork> *)
[06:02:20] <sharpy35> ok, guys, i ve been searching the web for many days and cant seem to find something: What i need is a file Uploading Module that shows a progress of the whole upload in ALL Browsers, even IE7 - 9 and that works without flash and that is highly customizable
[06:02:23] <BioMonday> I am in IE 10 but it's running in compatibility mode AFAIK
[06:02:27] <sharpy35> does anybody no one
[06:02:34] <Cork> BioMonday: what line?
[06:03:08] <BioMonday> 6406
[06:03:30] <Cork> BioMonday: well you have to step out from there
[06:03:39] <BioMonday> ?
[06:03:48] <Cork> BioMonday: that line throws the exception cause it is where the actual dom append happens
[06:03:57] <Cork> but the problem isn't there it is from what you send it
[06:04:47] <Cork> it does a fragment.appendChild
[06:05:00] <Cork> BioMonday: and it does it with the content you sent something somewhere
[06:05:08] <Cork> and what that "something" is
[06:05:18] <Cork> is what is one of the unknowns
[06:05:53] <BioMonday> Cork it's a canvas apparently
[06:06:22] <BioMonday> the flot library calls that from new Canvas("flot-base", placeholder);
[06:06:25] <Cork> canvas doesn't exist in ie8
[06:06:43] <BioMonday> Cork: I use excanvas
[06:06:51] <BioMonday> and that calls $(element).css({ direction: "ltr", position: "absolute", left: 0, top: 0 }) 				.appendTo(container);
[06:06:55] <Cork> then you arn't using a canvas
[06:07:04] <BioMonday> Cork well the library uses canvas for me
[06:07:08] <Cork> no
[06:07:13] <Cork> it fakes canvas
[06:07:13] <BioMonday> ?
[06:07:17] <BioMonday> ok
[06:07:20] <Cork> it uses xml
[06:07:23] <Cork> opps
[06:07:24] <Cork> sorry
[06:07:27] <Cork> vml
[06:07:45] <Cork> so the names of the functions called, doesn't help
[06:07:53] <Cork> you need to check what element you are actually working with
[06:08:00] <BioMonday> hm
[06:08:00] <BioMonday> ?
[06:08:12] <Cork> the problem is with the different dom elements
[06:08:13] <Cork> not js
[06:08:19] <BioMonday> I hate IE
[06:08:25] <Cork> so what is in the different dom elements is what matters
[06:08:34] <Cork> BioMonday: this isn't a unique case for ie
[06:08:53] <BioMonday> Cork I see
[06:09:01] <Cork> in this case it becomes more complicated cause you use abstraction layers
[06:09:02] <BioMonday> yet I am forced into compatibility mode
[06:09:09] <BioMonday> I use excanvas only for Ie
[06:09:10] <BioMonday> IE
[06:09:23] <Cork> made harder cause you use compatibility mode and multiple windows
[06:09:40] <Cork> BioMonday: sure, cause excanvas only works in ie
[06:09:59] <BioMonday> Cork in my case I include it only if It's an older version of IE
[06:10:30] <Cork> BioMonday: i know how excanvas works, you don't need to explain it
[06:10:43] <Cork> but when you have dom problems the abstraction layers isn't what is important
[06:12:23] <BioMonday> Cork I don't
[06:14:38] <BioMonday> I am so sad
[06:16:06] <BioMonday> Cork: is it maybe because I include excanvas in my original window, but not in the popup
[06:16:07] <BioMonday> ?
[06:16:37] <Cork> might be, or that you run the js for it on one window and modify the dom on the other
[06:17:13] <BioMonday> Cork I call a js function from inside the window, but that is a function that I obtain via window.opener,
[06:17:23] <BioMonday> so I call a function outside the window
[06:23:12] <BioMonday> Cork: please tell me what to do, I am lost without you, I beg thee
[06:23:38] <Cork> BioMonday: i've already told you, you need to reduce what happens
[06:23:49] <Cork> then you can check what exact call is causing the problem
[06:23:58] <BioMonday> Cork: but I am be to javascript, I started using it maybe a month ago for the first time, I don't know all this stuff
[06:24:09] <BioMonday> new* not be
[06:24:23] <Cork> BioMonday: then you need to make a testcase that someone can help you reduce
[06:24:34] <Cork> i can't answer your generic questions with a specific answer
[06:24:48] <BioMonday> :(
[06:38:39] <Anticom> hi all
[06:39:03] <Anticom> could it be, that the API docs for jq-ui datepicker is messed up? http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ or why is onClose an option and not an event?!
[06:39:05] <BioMonday> Cork: if it works outside the window, should I just put all the javascript in the window and plot from there?
[06:39:08] <Anticom> :O
[06:40:26] <Cork> Anticom: well it wouldn't have "on" in the name if it was an event
[06:40:46] <Cork> why it's only a callback i don't know though
[06:41:28] <Cork> BioMonday: that would most likely be the safe way to do it
[06:41:34] <Anticom> Cork so what's the semantic difference between a callback that get's fired on a specific event and an option that configures the datepicker :P
[06:41:38] <T0w3ntuM> should .get() be called outside the document ready function?
[06:41:45] <Anticom> in my oppinion the onDoStuff callbacks are events
[06:41:47] <BioMonday> Cork: but that would make it harder, since I generate the popup window in javascript itself
[06:42:29] <Cork> T0w3ntuM: "should" is a bit weird, but it could
[06:42:48] <BioMonday> Cork: I don't understand why it doesn't work, I pass it a dom element, it's just from inside a window
[06:43:44] <T0w3ntuM> Well, i'm getting json from a php script. It then outputs to a table and sets several id's and classes in thet able that I need to act upon with more ajax. Would it be beneficial to get the data outside the document ready and the rest inside document ready?
[06:45:16] <Cork> T0w3ntuM: most likely not
[06:45:27] <Cork> T0w3ntuM: unless the original page is huge
[06:45:43] <Cork> ready is triggered as soon as the html has been parsed to dom
[06:46:40] <T0w3ntuM> Not exactly. It's an inventory that I need to edit inline.
[06:47:04] <T0w3ntuM> It gets the inventory from the database. The php script querys the db and outputs json.
[06:47:12] <T0w3ntuM> I need to get that json into a editable table.
[06:47:33] <Cork> T0w3ntuM: what matters isn't the json, or the phh
[06:47:36] <Cork> *php
[06:47:45] <Cork> what matters is the size of the original html file sent
[06:48:00] <Cork> if it is huge, then yes ready could take a second or so to load
[06:48:16] <Cork> if not then no the difference it time wouldn't matter
[06:49:03] <T0w3ntuM> It's not huge. But I need to wait for the ajax call to complete and the table to be loaded before I can act on it. This depends on the database utilization and all that fun stuff.
[06:49:56] <Cork> then what matters is the ajax callback not where you put the call
[07:35:28] <doug65536> qUnit doesn't run modules in order?
[07:35:33] <doug65536> what's the point then?
[07:36:13] <doug65536> how can you make a setup work correctly if it is racing with all the other tests
[07:37:03] <doug65536> I tried stop before all my tests then start at the end but it causes massive malfunction then
[07:37:38] <doug65536> test 12 runs first
[07:38:46] <sarahm> Hi i have a silly a question but i cant figure it out
[07:39:08] <_rgn> OT: my website doesn't render properly on an android device. what's the best way to "emulate" android with a chrome browser on a mac?
[07:39:19] <doug65536> if I had to pick one word for qunit: sucks
[07:39:58] <sarahm> i have an array of xpath, and i want depending on the number of items to create as many arrays as xpaths
[07:41:37] <sarahm> can anybody help to write a loop for this ? :/ i might be tired but i dont know how to do it
[07:41:44] <sarahm> here it is: http://bpaste.net/show/OErUmw4RDkmHVNI7sOty/
[07:42:50] <doug65536> sarahm: really? var xpaths = []; for (var i = 0; i < xpath.length; ++i) { xpaths[i] = xml.xpath(xpath[i]); }
[07:43:53] <sarahm> doug65536:  i really really have no idea why i asked this question . thnks anyway
[08:00:44] <BillCriswell> var xpaths = xpath.map(function(path){ return xml.xpath(path); }); could also work.
[08:01:47] <grafi> map all the things ^^
[08:02:26] <BillCriswell> I always forget .map() isn't available in IE8. Hate that thing.
[08:02:34] <grafi> who doesnt
[08:02:40] <grafi> yuck
[08:02:47] <doug65536> $.map is there though
[08:02:52] <grafi> i dont even have to support it
[08:02:55] <doug65536> I kept it simple though
[08:03:01] <grafi> i still dont like it xD
[08:03:05] <BillCriswell> Would need to do like $.map(xpath, function(path){})
[08:03:13] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Indeed!
[08:03:22] <grafi> kist
[08:03:27] <grafi> okidoki
[08:08:58] <WrinkledCheese> Windows 8 IE 10 is the stupidest POS I've ever encountered.  They've removed onmouse events and replaced them with onmspointer events.
[08:09:05] <doug65536> I can't believe this... why would qunit randomly run test 11 first when it it is in its old module
[08:09:25] <doug65536> own module*
[08:10:00] <grafi> oO
[08:10:13] <grafi> sounds like you are doing it wrong :D
[08:10:58] <doug65536> grafi: does that look wrong to you: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/cd24f1dc5f4197c0a8d2
[08:15:28] <grafi> so you are testing your login.php in javascript?
[08:15:30] <grafi> o√¥
[08:15:34] <grafi> woot
[08:15:53] <doug65536> I have phpunit unit tests too
[08:15:56] <doug65536> these run after
[08:17:16] <doug65536> the php unit tests test the underlying session and user database functionality
[08:17:22] <doug65536> the js tests test the ajax interface
[08:18:15] <grafi> sure, but doesnt that mainly consist of the $.ajax?
[08:18:42] <doug65536> it verifies the responses and makes sure that it gets 401 Unauthorized appropriately, etc
[08:18:59] <grafi> not sure I would test that at all :x
[08:19:04] <grafi> then again I'm lazy :P
[08:19:37] <doug65536> yeah, better to make an ass of myself when the client calls and says, "um, I can login with the wrong password"
[08:20:00] <grafi> yeah but shouldnt that be covered by the phpunit tests?
[08:21:01] <doug65536> well, what if my js code screws up and redirects them to the real page because the ajax interface screwed up, with everything broken
[08:21:54] <doug65536> tests are completely worthwhile. if you are lazy you make tests, instead of hours debugging mysterious problems later
[08:22:43] <grafi> not debating that at all, Im just saying it seems to me like you are testing your php stuff via javascript
[08:23:14] <doug65536> I already told you I unit test the stuff behind the ajax interface in php unit tests
[08:23:30] <doug65536> how do I test that the page correctly handles failed ajax from php
[08:23:32] <grafi> cant help you with the actual problem though :|
[08:23:59] <slax0r> doug65536, failed ajax as when something went wrong within the php script?
[08:24:12] <slax0r> like a php error or something?
[08:24:40] <doug65536> slax0r: no, as in, making sure it gets 401 appropriately, and doing fuzz tests like missing username, password, bad action, no action, etc etc
[08:25:00] <slax0r> so like your error checks?
[08:25:28] <doug65536> how do I unit test that it called header(... "401 Unauthorized") in a php unit test?
[08:25:29] <doug65536> you cant
[08:26:07] <slax0r> ajax has two handlers, success and error, I'm pretty sure 'error' would be executed on a 401
[08:26:10] <doug65536> the js tests do "the real thing"
[08:26:37] <doug65536> slax0r: should I just hope that it sends 401 when it should?
[08:26:39] <shvelo> btw if you're using PHP this is a must http://phperror.net/
[08:27:35] <slax0r> doug65536, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:27:38] <slax0r> take a look at complete
[08:27:46] <slax0r> you can check textStatus returned

[08:29:13] <_rgn> OT: my website doesn't render properly on an android device. what's the best way to "emulate" android with a chrome browser on a mac?
[08:29:24] <_rgn> last time i promise
[08:29:59] <grafi> im pretty sure there is more than one android device :x
[08:30:30] <slax0r> get an android emulator
[08:30:40] <grafi> maybe browserstack can help you, dont know if they have mobile devices ... does cost money though iirc
[08:30:59] <grafi> also what does your website do that the android doesnt like? :P
[08:31:10] <_rgn> css just renders poorly
[08:31:12] <_rgn> layout problem
[08:32:14] <grafi> that doesnt happen on an ios device?
[08:32:18] <grafi> cool
[08:32:55] <_rgn> yep
[08:33:15] <grafi> have a url?
[08:33:27] <grafi> i have an android
[08:37:52] <Doggie52> I'm getting "Couldn't bind to service" errors when trying to connect to a SOAP service in PHP: http://pastebin.com/uL98N18B
[08:37:54] <Doggie52> Any ideas?
[08:38:42] <slax0r> yeah
[08:38:46] <slax0r> this is kinda jQuery...
[08:38:48] <slax0r> PHP is at ##php
[08:39:01] <grafi> xD
[08:39:34] <Doggie52> LOL
[08:39:36] <Doggie52> wrong channel
[08:39:38] <Doggie52> Apologies
[08:40:43] <WrinkledCheese> Is there plan to implement Microsofts new Events system in jQuery?  IE MouseDown, MouseUp events don't exist anymore, instead they are replaced with MSPointerDown and MSPointerUp.
[08:41:08] <WrinkledCheese> This is WIndows 8 Internet Explorer's new Event system.
[08:41:12] <doug65536> WrinkledCheese: you're kidding right?
[08:41:17] <WrinkledCheese> Nope
[08:41:40] <grafi> lol
[08:41:40] <WrinkledCheese> They sent a proposal to W3c who have opened a Working Draft last year.  MouseDown is GONE
[08:41:43] <doug65536> I wish web devs would turn their back on ie and stop catering to its bs
[08:41:44] <grafi> wat
[08:42:11] <WrinkledCheese> To bind mouse, pen and touch events into a unified event system.
[08:42:38] <WrinkledCheese> There are other libraries that do this but I would prefer not to rewrit all of my jQuery code to use another library.
[08:43:05] <WrinkledCheese> doug65536, not developers choice.
[08:44:03] <WrinkledCheese> Developers get paid to write what sales teams advertise who in turn advertise what the customer wants and the customer wants it to work with what they already use which is Internet Explo?.............sive diarhea.
[08:44:18] <doug65536> if (strstr("MSIE ", $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) >= 0) { exit(header("Location: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/")); }
[08:45:20] <WrinkledCheese> doug65536, a customer who pays $100,000 for a website isn't going to like that solution.
[08:45:31] <darkfrog> is there a good rich editor that would allow me to define external controls?
[08:45:54] <darkfrog> so instead of having controls on the editor itself, the page could have a toolbar with controls?
[08:50:17] <doug65536> what a bunch of morons. here's a blog comment from a blog post introducing their idiotic proprietary events: "Making this work for real and with all browsers‚Äîincluding versions of Internet Explorer before IE9‚Äîrequires a bit more work." Apparently, even more work is required for old versions of IE
[08:50:53] <doug65536> microsoft's IE team devs cant even get stuff to work across IE versions
[08:56:43] <grafi> well im not surprised
[08:56:52] <grafi> :P
[09:13:15] <doug65536> I figured out what was going on. qunit insists that all tests be atomic. it runs any test that failed first when you run it. if you really need to have deterministic test order, you can do QUnit.config.reorder = false;
[09:38:33] <nhulea> yo !
[09:58:06] <bonzai_> Hello, I'm trying to find a datepicker in which I can set dates as d/m/y. Anyone knows one? I've tried Jquery UI Datepicker with no luck.
[10:13:31] <boolieman> hello i have an interesting exception that im having trouble to decypher
[10:14:43] <boolieman> required += data.nutrients['Sodium'].viewableQuantity; is throwing an exeption of += being an
[10:14:47] <boolieman> unexpected token
[10:15:37] <boolieman> i am using this operator many times but it just seems like a random line its catching on this, any ideas would be great, im debugging in chrome
[10:17:16] <BillCriswell> boolieman: Is there a semi colon at the end of the previous line?
[10:17:37] <boolieman> the previous line is an if declaration and i have checked all those elements
[10:18:04] <boolieman> if ((jQuery.isEmptyObject(data.nutrients['Sodium']) != true ) { 					required += data.nutrients['Sodium'].viewableQuantity; 					required += '</span><span class="textright right bold">' + data.nutrients['Sodium'].viewablePercentage; 				} else { 					required += 'N/A </span><span class="textright right bold"> N/A'; 				}
[10:18:11] <boolieman> that is the entire if declaration
[10:18:40] <boolieman> oh i see it now that i pasted it....
[10:18:41] <boolieman> sorry
[10:19:13] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[10:19:14] <boolieman> missed a ")" token
[10:22:33] <BillCriswell> Happens!
[10:32:21] <gnu_d> Hi, how do I access an instance of an object if defined inside function($) ? - I can see the object instance inside $(this).objectInstanceName, but when I try to access it via firebug's console says undefined, is there way to access it ?
[10:38:09] <fission6> i have a table i want to be able to copy the table/html to a users clipboard so they can paste into excel, any ideas / plugins?
[10:40:57] <v1king> How should I go about adding specific classes to individual dialog buttons?
[10:42:07] <krawchyk> gnu_d: you have scoping issues, any vars declared inside of function(){} are not available outside this block unless you are shadowing vars outside the function's scope
[10:42:30] <krawchyk> gnu_d: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-javascript-scope/
[10:44:09] <jeffsmykil> Im trying to pass a parameter on click that has a \ in it, I can't get this to escape
[10:44:19] <krawchyk> fission6: i think you need to use flash for interactions with a user's clipboard, html5 spec is not implemented http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/
[10:44:39] <krawchyk> v1king: $('selector').addClass('classes')
[10:45:02] <krawchyk> jeffsmykil: is it a string?
[10:45:48] <fission6> hmm ok
[10:45:52] <jeffsmykil> yeah it is krawchyk
[10:46:02] <fission6> even if i want to just copy html from th edom
[10:46:08] <jeffsmykil> well, it's a variable that holds a string
[10:46:42] <krawchyk> fission6: yes, accessing the clipboard is an OS level interaction, not a browser interaction
[10:47:00] <krawchyk> fission6: therefore there are a lot of potential security issues, hence why flash allows it :D
[10:47:09] <krawchyk> jeffsmykil: example?
[10:47:42] <jeffsmykil> krawchyk: coming momentarily
[10:47:47] <alexr2> can anyone point me to a substr function that works with special chars? things like üò≠üò≠ cause the regular substr to be off
[10:48:10] <krawchyk> alexr2: as in ##javascript
[10:48:13] <krawchyk> ask*
[10:50:21] <v1king> krawchyk: I guess my question could be better rephrased as how should I go about individually selecting dialog buttons with a selector. Heh
[10:50:21] <krawchyk> alexr2: i haven't tried it, but take a look at https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string
[10:51:28] <krawchyk> v1king: id just use semantic class names so you know what button youre selecting. but im sensing youre trying to programmatically accomplish this? have an example or some code i could wrap my head around?
[10:51:40] <jeffsmykil> pac
[10:51:52] <alexr2> krawchyk: gimme a sec, i'll try lodash's version
[10:53:01] <v1king> krawchyk: Not necessarily trying to do it programmatically (as in, the dialog boxes aren't dynamic content) so I could use semantic selectors I guess, but that doesn't seem too future-proof. Heh, my code is god-awful and jsfiddle is not my fortay but I'll see if I can whip something up..
[10:53:46] <PhlowHome> Anyone ever use jQuery File Upload plugin?
[10:53:59] <gnu_d> krawchyk: shadowing vars worked well :)
[10:55:29] <v1king> http://jsfiddle.net/AdFkF/ shows the dialog creation options, I'm trying to apply a different style to the Yes/No buttons (as jquery gives all buttons the same classes), so I could use a content selector I guess? Or a :first-child or something, but I feel like there is a better way to do it.
[10:55:59] <krawchyk> gnu_d: careful with taht, make sure you are safe to modify those vars outside of hte function's scope
[10:58:31] <fission6> how do i print the html() of an elemtn and include its html vs its childen
[10:58:36] <fission6> i select a table and do html
[10:58:41] <fission6> and don't get the table tag
[10:59:40] <krawchyk> innerHTML
[10:59:44] <krawchyk> or text()
[10:59:55] <PhlowHome> outerHTML to get the table tag too
[11:01:02] <fission6> ?
[11:01:11] <InphraRed> Hi.  I'm using .load to dynamically load content into a div on a page.  However, after having loaded dialgos and forms and witnessing multiple submissions per each time I called '.load' or (clicked the link to load the content).  I noticed that .load() was always appending the HTML to the div in the browser (so if I generate the source code, the source gets larger and larger).  I tried to use $('.my-div').empty().load('/location/formdata.html'); but 
[11:01:13] <krawchyk> v1king: this is why i dont use jqueryui buttons haha i usually just include them in the dialog markup and then attach events to them
[11:01:14] <fission6> $('table').text()
[11:01:19] <krawchyk> fission6: indeed
[11:01:24] <InphraRed> how can I clear the contents before loading in content.
[11:01:25] <InphraRed> ?
[11:01:31] <krawchyk> fission6: or $('table')[0].innerHTML
[11:01:34] <fission6> nah that does;'t work
[11:01:35] <PhlowHome> fission6, $('table').prop('outerHTML')
[11:01:38] <InphraRed> or replace the content of that div
[11:01:51] <fission6> that works thanks PhlowHome
[11:02:14] <krawchyk> InphraRed: $('selector').empty().html(blah) or $('selector').replaceWith(blah)
[11:03:08] <krawchyk> v1king: check this out, see if it works http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1138291/jquery-dialog-save-cancel-button-styling
[11:05:44] <v1king> krawchyk: Alright, I'll give it a try, although from the comments it seems like that functionality is changing per-release
[11:05:46] <InphraRed> krawchyk .html() literally prints my url into the box.
[11:05:54] <BillCriswell> krawchyk: They're pretty different! Be careful!
[11:06:30] <krawchyk> BillCriswell: youre right, replaceWith will take the parent with it right?
[11:06:36] <BillCriswell> krawchyk: Yesh.
[11:06:37] <fission6> is there a way to spit out the html with things escaped like <> in a script tag
[11:06:46] <InphraRed> krawchyk I tried var p = $.get( 'my url' ); $('mytargetdiv').emtpy().html(p, function() { div_update('mytargetdiv); }); but this doesn't work eitehr
[11:06:47] <krawchyk> BillCriswell: doh, good catch!
[11:07:10] <PhlowHome> fission6, <pre>content here</pre>
[11:07:26] <fission6> hmm ok
[11:07:27] <fission6> thanks
[11:08:00] <BillCriswell> Wonder if anyone uses <kbd> anymore.
[11:09:22] <krawchyk> InphraRed: $.get(url).done(function(data) { $('targetdiv').html(data) });
[11:09:26] <PhlowHome> fission6, also .text('html here')
[11:09:42] <BillCriswell> PhlowHome: That's what I was thinking. Not sure <pre> would work like that.
[11:09:58] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1219860/html-encoding-in-javascript-jquery first answer here looks pretty good fission6.
[11:10:01] <v1king> krawchyk: bingo! thanks.
[11:10:15] <krawchyk> v1king: no worries glad it worked!
[11:11:12] <InphraRed> krawchyk that doesn't work either
[11:11:16] <fission6> well the issue is i have html in an element which has a <script>..</script> its not an actual script just text (not html in the dom) when i do innerHTML() its rendered without escaping the '<', etc
[11:11:35] <InphraRed>  <li class="dd_menu_item"><a href="#" onclick="$.get('/asp/db.aspx?tbl=19&typ=1').done(function(data) { $('.content-div').html(data); div_update('.content-div); }); this.blur();">link</a></li>
[11:12:22] <PhlowHome> fission6, that's quite confusing
[11:12:24] <InphraRed> nvm
[11:12:29] <krawchyk> InphraRed: :D
[11:12:31] <InphraRed> needed to close off the string
[11:12:46] <InphraRed> krawchyk lemme test the form submissions from the dynamic content
[11:12:52] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: Are you really putting it on the elements like that?
[11:13:25] <InphraRed> BillCriswell putting what into elements like what?
[11:13:27] <krawchyk> BillCriswell: lol i held my tongue
[11:13:48] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: The click listeners.
[11:13:59] <krawchyk> InphraRed: separation of concerns is a powerful idea, youre puking js calls into your html. html is your document structure, js is your document functionality
[11:14:25] <InphraRed> I know I can add event listeners else where
[11:14:26] <krawchyk> InphraRed: they are separate parts of your application and should remain separate in the codebase
[11:14:30] <InphraRed> this helps me keep track of things
[11:14:34] <krawchyk> InphraRed: totally up to personal preference though
[11:14:52] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: Understood.
[11:15:10] <InphraRed> but the HTML is still not replaced, so I'm sure the forms in the loaded conetnt will submitt multiple times
[11:15:30] <InphraRed> every time you click that link, all the html gets appended... though only one load is rendered
[11:16:12] <InphraRed> sigh
[11:16:43] <InphraRed> the forms within the loaded content, on submission submit multiple times, exactly one additional time for every time that link was clicked.
[11:17:06] <v1king> What exactly does button priority: 'secondary' do? I can't find it documented anywhere..
[11:17:34] <krawchyk> v1king: probably an old reference that was deprecated
[11:19:26] <v1king> alrighty then
[11:20:42] <jaydev> hi , I have a problem with $.ajax and json

[11:24:01] <jaydev> from flat JSON file
[11:24:07] <duch_kazatel> dude don't paste code in here.
[11:24:10] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it.
[11:24:14] <krawchyk> let's try this again jaydev.... paste that into htere http://jsfiddle.net/ click save at the top and copy/paste the link here
[11:24:15] <BillCriswell> jaydev: Check out the topic. Put it on jsbin of jsfiddle or something next time.
[11:24:29] <duch_kazatel> i really wish we had an ecmabot in here.
[11:24:38] <jaydev> oh sorry
[11:24:43] <jaydev> let me do it
[11:31:02] <holywarprofiteer> hey all, I am tring to add a transform attribut via .css but can't seem to get it to work
[11:31:07] <holywarprofiteer> this is what i have:
[11:31:10] <holywarprofiteer> var next_pixel_point = w.current_slide * w.slide_width;
[11:31:10] <holywarprofiteer> 	$(".slide-parent").css("transform: translate(-" + next_pixel_point + "px)");
[11:32:23] <InphraRed> fudge sticks
[11:33:11] <holywarprofiteer> ok, to simplify,
[11:33:13] <holywarprofiteer> $(".slide-parent").css("transform: translate(-" + 1920 + "px)");
[11:33:29] <Brodingo> $(".slide-parent").css("transform", "translate(-" + 1920 + "px)");
[11:33:44] <blindMoe> have you tried: (".slide-parent").css("transform", "translate(-" + 1920 + "px)");    ?
[11:33:54] <blindMoe> Brodingo beat me to it
[11:33:57] <InphraRed> krawchyk, can I have that link only load once?
[11:34:19] <holywarprofiteer> ok, thanks guys, im gonna try that out
[11:35:03] <holywarprofiteer> TOTALLY WORKS
[11:35:10] <Brodingo> SWEET
[11:35:12] <holywarprofiteer> Thanks Brodingo nad blindMoe
[11:36:53] <InphraRed> krawchyk what's wierd, (I'm looking at generated source from Webdev tools in Firefox), the javascript portion of the content loaded via .load is only loaded once, but all the HTML content, the forms data, is loaded mulitple times.
[11:38:00] <InphraRed> for my delegate event listener on submit (using the 'on()' function in teh parent page), this is resulting the mulitple submissions.. as it's picking up multiple forms injected into the page.
[11:39:36] <jaydev> here is the jsfiddle link http://jsfiddle.net/jaydevonline/RxPsZ/
[11:40:21] <jaydev> I want to get data from flat JSON file
[11:40:32] <jaydev> and feed it to image slider
[11:41:01] <blindMoe> jaydev: what part is not working for you?
[11:41:11] <blindMoe> Hard to work with the jsfiddle since it is no jsonp
[11:41:36] <jaydev> slider do not get data
[11:41:46] <jaydev> from handlebars template
[11:42:37] <blindMoe> does the console.log(data) print anything out?
[11:43:05] <jaydev> yes
[11:44:55] <blindMoe> jaydev: have you tried simply feeding the json directly to handlebars to ensure it does what you want w/o the ajax call involved?
[11:45:05] <jaydev> console.log(tmpl(data))  also prints HTML with data
[11:45:29] <jaydev> yes , without ajax it works fine
[11:45:34] <jaydev> with Hndelbars
[11:45:43] <jaydev> Handlebars
[11:47:20] <jaydev> but when I make an ajax request an get data from JSON file , it is not working
[11:50:28] <blindMoe> jaydev: one step closer: http://jsfiddle.net/RxPsZ/1/
[11:50:50] <jaydev> okay
[11:51:02] <blindMoe> jaydev: switch your .innerHTML to .html()
[11:51:16] <blindMoe> $('#imageslider').innerHTML = tmpl(data);
[11:51:43] <blindMoe> wouldn't mix jQuery with DOM calls
[11:52:27] <jaydev> but what s wrong with ajax?
[11:52:36] <jaydev> I still do not get it
[11:52:53] <jaydev> without ajax it works fine
[11:54:01] <blindMoe> jaydev: did you switch that line of code?
[11:54:07] <blindMoe> because w/o the switch it doesn't work for me
[11:54:35] <jaydev> ok. let me do it
[11:54:58] <jaydev> in ajax , right?
[11:55:07] <blindMoe> yeah just the .innerHTML line
[11:55:15] <jaydev> ok
[11:55:16] <blindMoe> jquery uses .html()
[11:55:39] <blindMoe> $('#imageslider').html( tmpl(data) );
[11:57:56] <jaydev> Yes, now it is working.
[11:58:01] <jaydev> my bad.
[11:58:04] <jaydev> thanks
[11:58:28] <jaydev> you helped me a lot
[11:58:59] <krawchyk> InphraRed: if you use .one() instead of .on() it will only attach for the first click on the element
[11:59:05] <krawchyk> InphraRed: is that what you mean?
[12:06:50] <boolieman> hello there im having a issue figuring my head around addressing a json object to do a for each in jQuery, my json tree that i need to address is data.nutrients['some object name'] and im having trouble figuring how the jquery is selecting the object name
[12:07:37] <boolieman> should a simple for (data.nutrients) select the 'object name' ? or is it more than that...
[12:11:57] <krawchyk> boolieman: use Object.keys(obj) to get the names
[12:12:39] <krawchyk> boolieman: jQuery is not meant for plucking out json objects
[12:13:51] <boolieman> i just need to print for each and then do a test so that should help me LOADS thank you btw
[12:14:26] <boolieman> sometimes its just hard to find what function to look at when your the only front end and admitedly a junior at a company
[12:15:49] <krawchyk> wat?
[12:16:06] <krawchyk> print for each and then do a test?
[12:16:35] <krawchyk> boolieman: and no worries, i was in the same boat for my first gig at a startup
[12:17:36] <boolieman> get each, run a test on a nested variable, then print
[12:17:42] <boolieman> a variable
[12:23:51] <krawchyk> boolieman: http://jsfiddle.net/V76pM/
[12:24:00] <krawchyk> 2 ways to do it
[12:29:59] <dolphone> does  anyone know how to dynamically create a selectmenu with jquery mobile. this doesnt work - http://jsfiddle.net/UxV6z/
[12:42:19] <boolieman> krawchyk are you still on?
[12:42:27] <krawchyk> boolieman: yea whats uo
[12:42:29] <krawchyk> up
[12:43:30] <boolieman> so far i have http://jsfiddle.net/5Tpvu/ which i know may have some errors but thats at least the logic direction
[12:43:44] <InphraRed> this is really frustrating, why is it multiple calls to '.load()' keeps html data n-times in memory
[12:44:16] <InphraRed> how can I unreference those classes from teh browser before loading the data?
[12:45:24] <boolieman> im working with some existing styles to style the outputs along the way and make pretty lol
[12:45:25] <krawchyk> boolieman: are you actually storing this data with strings or is this a representation?
[12:45:39] <boolieman> its something so i know where i was goin
[12:46:09] <boolieman> so i select the 'nutrient' and have to test a value within that object , if true start doing an alternating print function
[12:46:18] <saimon69> hey got a damn bug in ie7 for tag injection
[12:46:24] <krawchyk> InphraRed: you have the code somewhere?
[12:47:20] <boolieman> just these damn selectors in json i havent quite worked this deep into them before.... gah!
[12:47:28] <krawchyk> boolieman: that "test" is always going to be true. you are testing if a string is true, and string are truthy in js
[12:47:40] <krawchyk> boolieman: this is NOT json
[12:47:50] <krawchyk> boolieman: you do not use jQuery to select things in json
[12:48:02] <krawchyk> jquery is a dom manipulation library et all
[12:48:14] <krawchyk> what you are doing in that fiddle is not json anything
[12:48:57] <boolieman> well nested arrays is actually what its going into it as
[12:49:24] <krawchyk> boolieman: i need a better idea of what your data looks like, youre just using strings here that isn't helping since youre literally testing if a string == true
[12:54:59] <boolieman> updated the fiddle with a slightly trimmed string that im getting as data
[12:57:33] <krawchyk> boolieman: thanks
[12:58:12] <boolieman> i just trimmed it down to data.nutrients tree i know its big but thats why a for system is the way to go
[12:59:27] <InphraRed> krawchyk trying to isolate it as an example
[12:59:41] <InphraRed> might be good as I will have to micro analyze what I'm doing
[13:02:58] <javalover> very simple question
[13:03:29] <javalover> i'm creating an object using var myvar = $('<html stuff>');
[13:03:41] <javalover> how can I use .slice on this object?
[13:05:11] <krawchyk> boolieman: you have jquery on this project right?
[13:08:24] <krawchyk> boolieman: cause that data is a string and you need to parse it to json first
[13:10:13] <boolieman> i do have jquery i think i just figured it out maybe....
[13:14:22] <boolieman> its sooo close krawchyk gah so i can get it to select the property name area eg 'calcium' as the var nutrient, should i be constructing the string and beable to test it as a variable for data.nutrients.'nutrient'.percOnly type idea?
[13:15:21] <krawchyk> you should not be constructing strings man
[13:15:22] <krawchyk> im telling you
[13:15:24] <krawchyk> use json
[13:15:29] <krawchyk> $.parseJSON(data)
[13:15:37] <krawchyk> then you dont have to do all this string manipulation
[13:15:41] <boolieman> ooohhh okay
[13:15:56] <celediw> Hello
[13:16:13] <celediw> i want to ask for a help
[13:16:32] <celediw> i don't understand this $('> a .over',li)
[13:17:11] <krawchyk> boolieman: something like this, but this doenst work i dont have time to fix it http://jsfiddle.net/WZSkr/1/
[13:17:40] <charan> celediw, doesnt it mean the first anchor in the body and also it should have classname over
[13:17:50] <krawchyk> dont build your DOM manually either, use jQuery. much easier
[13:17:55] <charan> celediw, and the selector also selects all li's on the page
[13:18:11] <PhlowHome> li is context for that selector
[13:18:15] <PhlowHome> it starts there
[13:20:06] <celediw> so it mean all a child of li with class .over
[13:20:10] <celediw> ?
[13:20:27] <PhlowHome> no, direct children <a> with class over
[13:21:23] <celediw> i thought that it shoud be like $('li > a .over')
[13:21:57] <PhlowHome> that would select all direct children <a> of all li's.  You're giving it a specific li
[13:22:26] <PhlowHome> (or potentially an array of specific li's)
[13:22:47] <PhlowHome> (or potentially anything, since li is just a variable name :) )
[13:26:26] <celediw> thank you  but still it's hard for me to understand that.
[13:28:16] <InphraRed> krawchyk I have a sample setup
[13:28:28] <charanl> PhlowHome, doesn't this $('> a .over',li) mean selecting 'a' and 'li'?
[13:28:41] <InphraRed> it should be alls tripped down to just show basic design and implementation of what my problem is, and the problem can be reproduced here
[13:31:01] <PhlowHome> charanl, no, second param in that usage is the context to select within
[13:31:39] <InphraRed> http://www.sock-stream.net/jquery-test1.html       clicking 'click me' will call .load and populate 'content-div'.  within the loaded content, there'll be a dialog button which will display a form.  When you click submit, it does submit, but will submit the same number of times you click 'click me'.  if you click it twice, the form will submit twice.
[13:31:43] <PhlowHome> (strange that it's the second param, not sure why they did that)
[13:33:10] <InphraRed> you will have to select a software version
[13:33:44] <boolieman> krawchyk i did a little tinkering and got it to work a different way from yours
[13:34:06] <dangerousdave> Can i get a code review, it works, but i'm hacking http://pastie.org/8284282
[13:34:17] <dangerousdave> thanks
[13:34:44] <boolieman> krawchyk i can throw it up in a fiddle if you want
[13:36:34] <InphraRed> krawchyk you see my jquery test ?
[13:36:40] <celediw> if you wan't to check code it't here http://goo.gl/qvJLzN
[13:36:58] <celediw> this is web template
[13:41:28] <omnipotent1> anybody familiar with jquery waypoints?
[13:41:59] <doug65536> omnipotent1: yes
[13:43:06] <omnipotent1> doug65536: I'm trying to use extendFn to create a common callback and pass in a variable, but it seems like when I can $().waypoint('myFunction') it gets triggered right away
[13:44:16] <doug65536> omnipotent1: that is what it is supposed to do
[13:44:30] <omnipotent1> ah, I feared as much, thanks
[13:45:23] <doug65536> omnipotent1: what were you trying to do?
[13:45:30] <doug65536> omnipotent1: what does your extension do?
[13:46:02] <omnipotent1> doug65536: I just wanted to have a common callback because each callback calls the same thing with different arguments
[13:46:14] <doug65536> omnipotent1: you can do that with javascript
[13:46:41] <InphraRed> does anyone know why my forms are submitting once for everytime .load was called?
[13:46:42] <doug65536> omnipotent1: make a closure that returns the handler function... have the closure capture the parameters
[13:47:02] <doug65536> omnipotent1: I'll show you an example
[13:47:11] <omnipotent1> ok, thanks
[13:50:32] <doug65536> omnipotent1: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YckEH/1/
[13:50:48] <doug65536> omnipotent1: the function it returns is the actual callback
[13:50:59] <doug65536> omnipotent1: but it retains the ability to "see" those parameters forever
[13:51:03] <omnipotent1> I see
[13:51:04] <omnipotent1> thanks
[13:52:52] <javalover> i'm so confused
[13:53:07] <javalover> for .slice the examples use $('li').slice(1)
[13:53:24] <javalover> but what I want to do is like mydata('li').slice
[13:53:30] <javalover> but i have no clue how i'm supposed to do that...
[14:05:01] <InphraRed> w000t
[14:05:05] <InphraRed> I solved my problem
[14:05:07] <InphraRed> :D
[14:05:17] <InphraRed> does anyone care? :P
[14:06:02] <jedimind> InphraRed I DONT
[14:06:05] <jedimind> but you can tell me anyway
[14:06:09] <InphraRed> damnit
[14:06:17] <InphraRed> you made me ctrl-u my explanation
[14:07:51] <friedbyte> is there a way to find out how many pixels an element is down the page, and use that value to position a different element?
[14:08:31] <InphraRed> so, in the .on() function (which delegates handlers for future elements), I explicitly referenced the nth child of the element.  $(document).on("submit", '.insertform:eq(0)', function(event) {blah});  this makes sure it only works with a particular form (every time you hit .load it adds the HTML in the browsers memory).  Secondly, at the end of that function, I added a 'return false;' which prevents the whole page reloading in the event there are mul
[14:09:10] <InphraRed> now my page behaves as expected
[14:11:41] <javalover> how can I grab the first 10 divs from a jquery object?
[14:12:02] <javalover> so var object = "<div></div>"
[14:12:24] <javalover> err i mean var object = $('<div></div>');  how can I grab first 10 from object?
[14:12:24] <blindMoe_> javalover: have you looked in to $.slice() ?
[14:12:28] <javalover> all day
[14:12:33] <javalover> but i can't grab from object
[14:12:51] <blindMoe_> well your object doesn't have any children if that is how you are creating it
[14:12:51] <javalover> the examples are like $('div').slice()
[14:12:55] <javalover> how do I do this with object instead?
[14:13:06] <javalover> I want to do object.slice()
[14:13:13] <blindMoe_> object.children('div').slice()  ?
[14:13:14] <javalover> but how do I specify the type I want?
[14:13:17] <javalover> oh
[14:13:18] <javalover> is that how!?
[14:13:21] <javalover> holy crap finally
[14:13:21] <blindMoe_> try it
[14:13:30] <blindMoe_> I have never done it but it makes sense to me ;)
[14:16:06] <javalover> hmm
[14:16:21] <javalover> i try'd that but I did slice(0,2) but I got back 6 objects
[14:25:04] <blindMoe_> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/rFCcx/1/
[14:25:06] <blindMoe_> seems to work fine for me
[14:25:20] <javalover> well this can help
[14:25:23] <javalover> lets see
[14:27:54] <javalover> hmmm
[14:28:17] <blindMoe_> hrmmm
[14:28:37] <javalover> okay
[14:28:39] <javalover> so this does work but
[14:28:51] <javalover> mine probably sucks because i'm not using a real element
[14:29:02] <blindMoe_> yeah I would imagine so
[14:29:04] <javalover> yeah that makes moresense
[14:29:10] <javalover> so my issue is actually that
[14:29:25] <blindMoe_> you need to jsfiddle or jsbin your actual code so ppl can see what you are doing
[14:29:27] <javalover> I call .get()  and then I go var data = $(data);
[14:29:41] <javalover> but I take it, until I actually .append
[14:29:50] <javalover> that data isn't real....it's just a string?
[14:30:01] <jacoluta> I want to have a sortable list that can be populated with other elements. My 1st approach was to have two sortables and connect them. However I dont want the 1st set to be sortable. Just item that can fill the other sortable
[14:30:05] <solidoodlesuppor> is this the right channel for jqueryui questions, or does that have its own channel?
[14:30:17] <jacoluta> if that makes sense, any suggestions?
[14:30:19] <blindMoe_> javalover: I have never tried it but I believe you can have jQuery parse it on the callback
[14:30:41] <javalover> parse it how?
[14:30:42] <blindMoe_> jacoluta: sounds like you want two draggables and one sortable
[14:30:47] <solidoodlesuppor> question: My jquery autocomplete is showing groups of options rather than single options. Is this the intended default behavior, or an error in the input I am giving it?
[14:32:01] <solidoodlesuppor> (because I am looking for single options)
[14:32:21] <blindMoe_> javalover: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7331149/how-to-parse-returned-page-html-with-jquery-get
[14:32:34] <jacoluta> blindMoe_: i want them to just be sortable after they are dragged into the sortable. is that possible?
[14:33:20] <anew> what is it called when i am filling out a text box and user focuses out of it
[14:33:22] <anew> with a click or tab
[14:33:31] <BillCriswell> anew: blur.
[14:33:39] <anew> thx
[14:34:20] <blindMoe_> jacoluta: sure
[14:34:22] <javalover> yeah that's what i'm doing...
[14:34:33] <blindMoe_> javalover: did you read the last comment?
[14:34:35] <javalover> the answer $(data).find   that's exactly what I was doing so i'm not wrong
[14:34:40] <javalover> nope 1 sec
[14:35:22] <blindMoe_> I need to get back to my work but I would recommend creating a jsfiddle of your code so people can see what you are attempting more clearly
[14:35:25] <javalover> still what i'm doing though i think...
[14:35:31] <jacoluta> the problem with that is when i try to sort it. it treats it a draggable stil and sorts but duplicates
[14:35:31] <blindMoe_> that is the best way to get help in here
[14:35:35] <javalover> yeah your fiddle already helps
[14:35:38] <javalover> as I can see a working example
[14:35:54] <javalover> I appreciate it moe :-)
[14:36:00] <blindMoe_> np.. that will be $5
[14:36:02] <blindMoe_> ;)
[14:39:26] <BillCriswell> anew: There's also focusout if you need it to bubble up
[14:51:28] <anew> hmmm
[14:51:32] <anew> i'm not sure if i need it to
[14:51:37] <anew> bubble up confuses me
[14:52:17] <javalover> interesting I can use .filter('.class');  but I can't do .filter('#id');
[14:53:59] <doug65536> javalover: works for me
[14:54:08] <doug65536> $('<a id="AA">').filter('#AA')
[14:54:09] <doug65536> [
[14:54:09] <doug65536> <a id=‚Äã"AA">‚Äã</a>‚Äã
[14:54:09] <doug65536> ]
[14:54:09] <doug65536> $('<a id="AB">').filter('#AA')
[14:54:10] <doug65536> []
[14:55:24] <InphraRed> what does filter do?
[14:55:54] <doug65536> InphraRed: builds a new collection of objects that match the passed selector
[14:56:05] <doug65536> and returns it
[14:56:26] <doug65536> it filters the incoming elements
[14:57:31] <javalover> doug have you tried with mulitple ids?
[14:57:42] <javalover> say <a id = "AA"><a id = "AA">
[14:57:45] <javalover> will that work for you?
[14:58:03] <doug65536> it is illegal to have duplicate ids so it doesn't matter if that works or not
[14:58:09] <javalover> oh
[14:58:16] <javalover> so then I am supposed to label based on class
[14:58:17] <javalover> i take it
[14:58:31] <javalover> what I want is the first 10 posts
[14:58:39] <doug65536> ok, easy
[14:59:51] <doug65536> $('.posts').slice(0,10)
[15:00:06] <javalover> right so i have to label them based on class
[15:00:18] <doug65536> you don't have to
[15:00:18] <javalover> which now that I think about it
[15:00:21] <javalover> MAKES COMPLETE SENSE
[15:00:27] <javalover> how else would I do it?
[15:00:48] <doug65536> well, it depends. technically there are plenty of ways to know. a class is one easy way sure
[15:01:01] <javalover> it makes sense though when you relate to other languages
[15:01:09] <doug65536> you might know that all the children of some element are posts
[15:01:10] <javalover> sometimes I put html in this category like "meh that's not software"
[15:01:35] <javalover> but if I relate this to like any other language, calling based on class is completely logical vs based on id
[15:01:50] <doug65536> id is for finding one exact element
[15:02:01] <javalover> right i'm learning that now
[15:02:17] <javalover> i guess I was just afriad that having the same class with same css would somehow screw everything up
[15:02:45] <javalover> but it makes sense, I take it I can override the css based on ID anyway
[15:03:02] <doug65536> you don't have to have css for a class
[15:03:19] <doug65536> you could have class post and not have any .post in the css
[15:03:42] <javalover> right i'm just saying why I try'd to avoid it in general
[15:03:47] <javalover> but now I get it, it's a class lol
[15:05:53] <Freddie903> Hey so I have a couple questions about using .on as .delegate
[15:07:01] <Freddie903> I understand that .delegate is used to set a root element when a event is handled
[15:07:19] <Freddie903> So the event doesn't have to bubble all the way to the top of the document
[15:07:49] <Freddie903> What if I have an arbitrary root element with no class or id?
[15:08:34] <Freddie903> Would I just attach to the parent of the selector in that case?
[15:10:11] <doug65536> Freddie903: bubbling happens regardless of how you attach the event
[15:10:27] <doug65536> Freddie903: everything eventually calls .on
[15:10:36] <doug65536> Freddie903: the other ones are wrappers that call .on
[15:11:28] <doug65536> Freddie903: you can pass a selector as a parameter to .on to "filter" which events you get called for
[15:12:13] <doug65536> Freddie903: jquery has tons of ways to traverse around the dom, any way you can get to a node is fine
[15:13:09] <doug65536> Freddie903: the event will bubble all the way up anyway - at blazing speed. what's the concern?
[15:13:28] <Freddie903> doug65536, yes I understand that. I'm trying to determine what would be the most efficient way to handle a selector using .delegate with an arbitrary root element.
[15:13:43] <doug65536> .delegate is obsolete
[15:14:41] <doug65536> $(something).on('click', '.foo', function(event) { var elem = $(event.target); ... })
[15:14:54] <doug65536> handles clicks that come from something with class foo
[15:14:58] <Freddie903> doug65536, I know it was superceded by .on in v1.7. I'm trying to mimic the functionality of .delegate using .on but that's not the problem
[15:15:16] <doug65536> there's nothing to "mimic" it already behaves that way
[15:15:36] <SteveBenner9> anyone here using JQM 1.4?
[15:16:22] <Freddie903> doug65536: not always, it depends on how .on is implemented
[15:17:05] <doug65536> Freddie903: want to see the source code for .delegate?
[15:17:08] <Freddie903> doug65536: .on can be implemented to perform exactly like a .bind, .delegate, or .live....regardless, this isn't my issue
[15:17:09] <doug65536> delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {
[15:17:09] <doug65536> 		return this.on( types, selector, data, fn );
[15:18:09] <grafi> Freddie903 I dont see why having a parent element without id or class should be a problem, have you tried it yet?
[15:18:31] <Freddie903> doug65536: you seem to be missing my question
[15:19:48] <doug65536> I already answered that question. any way you can find a node is fine, then call .on on that
[15:20:41] <doug65536> Freddie903: what is the question? how to get the parent of a node?
[15:21:42] <doug65536> or do you want the "most efficient" way because your page is all bogged down from attaching event handlers :|
[15:22:06] <doug65536> you already know that you should attach to a parent
[15:22:09] <doug65536> whats the question
[15:23:45] <Freddie903> doug65536, grafi: yes how can I get the parent of the current node for the root element
[15:23:55] <doug65536> .parent()
[15:24:33] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/tCcpG/
[15:24:38] <doug65536> is there some way to identify that node? like, is it a div and nothing between there and the div is a div? .closest('div')
[15:24:48] <Freddie903> doug65536, grafi: how? $(this).parent.on("click", ".link", function() {...
[15:24:58] <doug65536> .parent()
[15:25:12] <talntid> I have 3 select boxes on a page. one of them is a multiselect. $(".press:first select").val() returns the value of the first select. what do I do to tell it to look for the multiselect box?
[15:25:14] <Freddie903> ?? I need to get the parent for the root element
[15:25:26] <doug65536> Freddie903: root of what
[15:26:02] <grafi> Freddie903 http://jsfiddle.net/tCcpG/ , secondly whats $(this) where are you binding from?
[15:26:24] <Freddie903> doub65536: $(get parent of this and put it here).on("click", ".link",.....
[15:26:54] <doug65536> $(this).parent().on(...
[15:28:28] <Freddie903> doug65536: alright, I wasn't aware that would work using .on. Sorry for any confusion. Thanks
[15:29:56] <doug65536> talntid: select[multiple]   I think
[15:30:04] <gremlyn> can anyone help me figure out why clicking 'cancel' on my confirm box is not preventing my checkbox from being checked? http://jsfiddle.net/TheGremlyn/urMZA/
[15:30:29] <talntid> correctamunndo. thanks, doug65536
[15:31:12] <doug65536> gremlyn: probably because it already changed by then
[15:31:33] <doug65536> gremlyn: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/urMZA/1/
[15:31:44] <gremlyn> oh... so doug65536 you're saying .change() is too late to catch it?
[15:32:06] <gremlyn> well that makes sense, thanks!
[15:32:08] <doug65536> gremlyn: yes, but click works if you change it with spacebar or whatever
[15:33:15] <Freddie903> talntid doug65536: $(this).parent().on("click", ".link"... doesn't work but $(".link").parent().on("click", ".link"...thanks for your js fiddle talntid. And your help doug65536.
[15:33:53] <talntid> Freddie903, I didn't do anything ;)

[15:38:16] <DarkSector_> Hey guys, I've been trying to select multiple check boxes based on the value coming through a json and I haven't had much success. I don't know how to work with JSON on jsfiddle so I've pasted my code here http://pastie.org/private/c9bsaml0cqt5x23htn45a   What am I doing wrong?
[15:40:56] <doug65536> DarkSector_: .monthempty?
[15:41:16] <doug65536> DarkSector: that's a parent of what you pasted?
[15:41:17] <DarkSector_> doug65536: That's the class of the checkboxes
[15:41:37] <DarkSector_> doug65536: Oh1
[15:41:44] <DarkSector_> so what can I do in this case?
[15:42:09] <doug65536> DarkSector_: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6fufJ/
[15:42:31] <DarkSector_> Awesome!
[15:42:33] <DarkSector_> Thanks doug65536
[15:42:35] <doug65536> DarkSector_: there's a mistake in the html for march
[15:42:40] <doug65536> DarkSector_: yw
[15:43:18] <DarkSector_> doug65536: err... what mistake, if you don't mind me asking?
[15:43:26] <doug65536> DarkSector_: looking :)
[15:44:13] <opscoding> Jquery by default makes a json data encoded into html form encoding and send it to server? is this true?
[15:44:24] <DarkSector_> doug65536: It's not just March, it's for every third thing that is selected
[15:45:23] <doug65536> how did the attributes get all scrambled like that
[15:45:48] <DarkSector_> doug65536: Oh apparently it selects Jan and Feb irrespective of what you may have selected initially
[15:46:19] <DarkSector_> doug65536: It's an output by Django, I have absolutely no say in the matter
[15:47:07] <doug65536> DarkSector_: they will always be 3 letter english month abbreviations?
[15:47:16] <DarkSector_> Yes
[15:51:39] <doug65536> DarkSector: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6fufJ/8/
[15:52:13] <doug65536> DarkSector_: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6fufJ/8/
[15:53:00] <DarkSector_> doug65536: Oh! That makes so much sense! Thank you! I am grateful
[15:53:03] <doug65536> DarkSector: another, probably more efficient way is to use id_month_#
[15:53:08] <gremlyn> value was always coming up as 0, 1, 2, which checked off the first two only (since value="0" didn't exist)
[15:53:33] <doug65536> gremlyn:  yes, makes sense
[15:59:46] <doug65536> DarkSector_: in case you miss it, I think you should change .attr("checked", false) to .prop("checked", false)
[16:01:44] <doug65536> DarkSector_: the line after where it sets $("#id_year").val(year);
[16:04:03] <DarkSector_> doug65536: got it!
[16:05:11] <Technical_13> Is there some kind of .removeCss() to remove say display: none; completely?
[16:05:35] <Technical_13> .removeCss("display");
[16:05:40] <Technical_13> ???
[16:05:50] <doug65536> Technical_13: .css("display", "none")
[16:06:06] <doug65536> Technical_13: or do you mean put it back to "normal"
[16:06:11] <doug65536> Technical_13: .css("display", "")
[16:06:24] <Technical_13> That sets display to none, I want to remove display altogether.
[16:06:44] <doug65536> Technical_13: .css("display", "")
[16:07:07] <Technical_13> Wouldn't that leave a residual display: ; ???
[16:07:12] <doug65536> no
[16:07:18] <Technical_13> Huh.  Ok
[16:07:21] <Technical_13> :)
[16:08:15] <doug65536> Technical_13: .css puts style= in the attribute. if you "remove display" it will return to whatever it was before you overrode it with .css
[16:09:08] <doug65536> Technical_13: so if your css says display: inline-block, then you do .css("display", "block") then do .css("display", "") it will go back to what css said: inline-block
[16:10:21] <doug65536> Technical_13: your question is ambiguous, so I'm not sure precisely what you mean by "remove" display
[16:10:36] <Technical_13> So... since the starting display is unpredictable, I could .removeAttr("style")
[16:10:46] <doug65536> Technical_13: don't do that
[16:10:55] <Technical_13> ??
[16:11:08] <doug65536> Technical_13: what do you mean "starting" display
[16:11:38] <Technical_13> This is mostly a hypothetical question atm.
[16:12:05] <doug65536> Technical_13: .css overrides the css file (and <style> tag etc)...
[16:12:22] <doug65536> Technical_13: if you do .css('display', '') you remove the override
[16:12:38] <rainabba> I have a css class setup with "margin-top:-28px;" and when I use $.prepend() to add an element with that class, that particular properly behaves as if it's set to 0px. If I use var ne = $('<div class="foo-bar"></div>'); ne.css('margin-top', '-28px'); then add ne to the dom, the margin-top is correct. Right now you're thinking, "easy, another rule os overriding margin-top" BUT according to Chrome
[16:12:39] <rainabba> inspector, that's not the case. I realize this is likely a mistake on my part or behavior specific to Chrome, but to cover bases, I was wondering if there's ANY reason to suspect that adding an element to the dom using prepend() would cause it to obey css class rules any differently that when I add the style after the fact (like using css())?
[16:13:30] <rainabba> coldhead: I miss you! (in case you're logging somehow)
[16:13:48] <doug65536> Technical_13: if there is nothing in the css or style tag, then doing that restores it to the default display for that tag
[16:14:26] <Technical_13> I get it, but I forget what my thought was..
[16:15:02] <doug65536> rainabba: there's no reason it wouldn't work like you expect
[16:15:49] <doug65536> rainabba: .foo-bar has margin-top:-28px; ?
[16:16:38] <doug65536> rainabba: what you are doing is very simple for the browser - I've seen it resolve incomprehensible messes in comparison to a simple margin :D
[16:18:39] <doug65536> I should make an extension for chome that checks if there are more than 20 tabs. and when there are, popup a messagebox "Are you in irc again?"
[16:19:12] <grafi> Wouldnt that be kind of useless?
[16:19:19] <doug65536> yes
[16:19:20] <grafi> You seem to be on irc a lot
[16:19:21] <grafi> :P
[16:22:26] <doug65536> jsfiddle messed up right now?

[16:23:08] <grafi> yeah
[16:23:23] <grafi> problems for me too doug65536

[16:25:01] * Technical_13 hates ergonomic keyboards.
[16:25:08] <doug65536> Technical_13: :O
[16:25:33] <doug65536> Technical_13: tell me you hate them after you've wrecked your hands for 20+ years
[16:25:50] <grafi> im pretty ok with my filco
[16:26:05] <grafi> and surely thats not very ergonomic either
[16:29:23] <doug65536> rainabba: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/PFHdk/1/
[16:30:08] <clarkk> I am trying to understand line 241 here http://goo.gl/eDk99L  Bearing in mind that the "this" used on line 240 is already a jquery object ( ie .each() is a jquery method), surely line 241 double-wraps it,  and thus should be $this = this. What does everyone else think, pls?
[16:31:00] <doug65536> clarkk: I'm not sure it is already a jquery object
[16:31:10] <doug65536> clarkk: IIRC it isn't
[16:32:18] <clarkk> Hi doug65536.  What is your reasoning, please?  How could I find out whether it is a jquery object or not? Or, how did you come to know?
[16:32:19] <doug65536> clarkk: remember that jquery selectors store an array of raw elements. it doesn't pre-wrapper them
[16:32:33] <doug65536> clarkk: easy, I'll check
[16:33:39] <clarkk> doug65536: then how do they do this.each() ?
[16:33:50] <clarkk> I can't see how that would work
[16:34:23] <doug65536> no no. that 'this' isn't the caller's this
[16:34:33] <doug65536> the incoming 'this' from the call is the selector
[16:34:40] <doug65536> the 'this' in the each are raw elements
[16:35:25] <doug65536> clarkk: raw, unwrapped DOM elements http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ms8R2/2/
[16:35:44] <doug65536> clarkk: each sets 'this' to each element of the incoming selector
[16:36:33] <doug65536> clarkk: I'm not making this stuff up. I've written jquery plugins :)
[16:37:00] <doug65536> clarkk: I just wrote one. it appends a bunch of crap to the body :)
[16:37:24] <doug65536> ah, but I broke the rules... 1 sec
[16:37:33] <clarkk> haha, I don't doubt you at all doug65536 - I am just trying to understand ;)
[16:37:58] <grafi> this in javascript can be very confusing indeed :)
[16:38:02] <doug65536> clarkk: ok, here's a real plugin http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ms8R2/4/
[16:38:45] <doug65536> chaining works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ms8R2/5/
[16:39:05] <clarkk> chaining works because you returned "this"
[16:39:30] <doug65536> well, I returned what this.each returned, but yes, essentially I returned the $('p') object
[16:40:42] <doug65536> also, my plugin doesn't depend upon $. and undefined can be minified
[16:40:44] <clarkk> doug65536: but a closure has been created there. The "this" refers to the body (I think).
[16:40:50] <clarkk> doug65536: what about this?  http://jsfiddle.net/ms8R2/6/
[16:41:08] <doug65536> no, nothing refers to the body
[16:41:32] <doug65536> that is something completely different
[16:41:55] <clarkk> how do you test whether an object is a jquery object?
[16:41:56] <doug65536> in my code, the 'each' processed each 'p'
[16:42:09] <doug65536> yours just does .toString on the $('p') selector over and over
[16:42:56] <doug65536> clarkk: do you follow?
[16:43:34] <clarkk> not quite. Let me mull it over for a few minutes ;)
[16:43:34] <doug65536> clarkk: why would you
[16:43:50] <clarkk> doug65536: how do you test whether an object is a jquery object, please?
[16:44:08] <rainabba> doug65536: Thanks. Figured it was user error :) Just have to clean up and dig more.
[16:44:27] <doug65536> any time you "check the type of an object" it's a red flag that you're doing something wrong
[16:44:48] <clarkk> um, I just want to determine what it is in our example
[16:44:51] <clarkk> not for production
[16:44:55] <rainabba> clarkk: Not sure there's such thing. JS rarely implements "class-like" behavior as you'd recognize it in other languages.
[16:44:56] <doug65536> $($($($('p'))))  is fine
[16:45:11] <tw2113> stop reading my code doug65536
[16:45:16] <doug65536> lol
[16:45:17] <rainabba> clarkk: What is it that you really want to know?
[16:45:35] <grafi> well you could probably test for jquery methods couldnt you?
[16:45:56] <grafi> as those are present in jq objects?
[16:45:58] <DarkSector_> I am trying to compare and raise an alert if value x is equal to the value of the first td in every row http://jsfiddle.net/WBY5w/ $(this).attr('value') doesn't seem to work neither does .val(). What do I need to use?
[16:47:19] <doug65536> clarkk: obj instanceof jQuery
[16:47:27] <grafi> .text()
[16:47:27] <b-ot> grafi: usually nicer
[16:47:40] <grafi> i love b-ot
[16:48:15] <rainabba> DarkSector_: val() won't do as you want on a td because it doesn't have a "value". If you're going to use an arbitrary attribute (I do it all the time), just use it but I'd recommend you avoid an ambigous one such as value or val. $(o).attr('x', 1), $(o).attr('x') == 1  should return true.
[16:48:17] <doug65536> js> print('wow, ideone is slow as hell')
[16:48:17] <clarkk> thanks doug65536
[16:48:24] <b-ot> doug65536: wow, ideone is slow as hell
[16:48:53] <grafi> DarkSector_ http://jsfiddle.net/WBY5w/2/
[16:49:36] <doug65536> rainabba: use .data('name', value) to put stuff in an element
[16:49:49] <grafi> +1
[16:50:20] <DarkSector_> rainabba, grafi thanks a lot, it helped
[16:53:28] <rainabba> doug65536: What's the selector to find elements having a particular data or data with a given value?
[16:53:42] <doug65536> rainabba: [data-name="value"]
[16:54:07] <rainabba> doug65536: Hmm. How does that differ from attributes then and is that as supported as attributes?
[16:54:08] <doug65536> rainabba: [data-name]
[16:54:23] <doug65536> rainabba: attributes that begin with data- are reserved for applications
[16:54:48] <doug65536> rainabba: also, jquery optimizes performance of data attributes by caching them
[16:55:10] <rainabba> Interesting and potentially very useful for my work. Thanks.
[16:56:41] <doug65536> rainabba: to get data, use one argument call: .data('name')
[16:59:04] <rainabba> $('div[qi=131241689]').data('qiTest', 131241689); $('div[data-qiTest]').data('qiTest'); <-- returns null What did I miss?
[16:59:26] <rainabba> $('div[qi=131241689]').data('qiTest') does return 131241689
[16:59:46] <doug65536> $('div[qi=131241689]') means find it
[16:59:49] <doug65536> it exists?
[17:00:27] <rainabba> Not sure if you're trying to make a point or didn't read my code.
[17:00:32] <doug65536> $('div[data-qiTest]').data('qiTest')  means find all of the elements that are div that have data-qiTest attribute...  then .data('qiTest') returns the data from the first one
[17:00:33] <rainabba> $('div[qi=131241689]').data('qiTest') does return 131241689
[17:00:53] <rainabba> $('div[data-qiTest]').data('qiTest'); <-- returns null
[17:01:16] <rainabba> My first question regarding data was  What's the selector to find elements having a particular data or data with a given value?
[17:01:33] <rainabba> You replied: rainabba: [data-name] Did I miss something?
[17:01:41] <doug65536> that is the selector
[17:01:53] <doug65536> to find ALL elements that have that
[17:01:59] <rainabba> Right, so once I set data, I want to find elements that have data set by that name
[17:02:06] <doug65536> <doug65536> rainabba: [data-name="value"]
[17:02:31] <rainabba> $('div[data-qiTest]').length==0
[17:02:48] <rainabba> So how do I select all elements with data('qiTest') set?
[17:04:00] <rainabba> Looks like I'd have to parse all possible elements then filter by testing each.
[17:04:42] <rainabba> doug65536: Or use a custom selector that does the same
[17:05:20] <clarkk> ok doug65536, I think it's clicked. :)  http://jsfiddle.net/ms8R2/8/
[17:05:22] <ubilli> hi
[17:05:47] <clarkk> doug65536: outside the loop is a jquery object, but inside are the raw elements
[17:05:50] <doug65536> clarkk: the docs say to return this.each's return value.
[17:05:57] <doug65536> clarkk: I would recommend it
[17:06:11] <doug65536> clarkk: yes
[17:06:26] <clarkk> doug65536: sorry, could you direct me to the page that says that?
[17:07:39] <doug65536> clarkk: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[17:07:45] <doug65536> clarkk: Using the each() Method
[17:07:59] <ubilli> does that work..?
[17:08:22] <doug65536> ubilli: does what work? returning this.each's return value?
[17:08:52] <rainabba> doug65536: Looks like data() is more appropriate for when you have fewer elements with more-than-basic data to associate. If you think otherwise, I'm all ears. Always looking for a better way to do things but it looks like data() would actually just create more work and cost efficiency without any gains for me.
[17:09:25] <rainabba> Does look like I should use "data-" as a prefix for the attributes I'm using in this way though just to be more clear.
[17:09:38] <ubilli> k am new to the code so ...
[17:10:49] <clarkk> ok thanks for that tip, doug65536 - and the page is great. I will read that!
[17:11:01] <clarkk> doug65536: what did you mean about undefined and minification?
[17:11:54] <doug65536> clarkk: main point: you can't trust $. that's why I wrapped passed it to the immediately invoked function expression. undefined is also a parameter, but nothing was passed, so it is undefined. minifiers will give undefined a short name
[17:12:00] <rainabba> I'm still stumped on my original question though because inspector shows the current value as 0px but when I use "Computed" and drill to find the source of the value, the rule listed is my rule as (exactly): "div.k-loading-rbl - -28px" (the middle hyphen is the rule - value delimiter)
[17:12:09] <doug65536> clarkk:  I passed in jQuery
[17:12:39] <doug65536> clarkk: so even if the caller has used jQuery.noConflict to remove $, my plugin will work
[17:12:44] <clarkk> doug65536: yes, I have already passed in jquery in my code, as you have, but I've not used the second parameter
[17:13:07] <doug65536> clarkk: just an unimportant trick to help minifiers make smaller code
[17:13:27] <doug65536> you can also pass in window, document, to help the minifier further
[17:13:32] <clarkk> where can I read about that doug65536?
[17:13:57] <doug65536> clarkk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4969692/good-tips-and-tricks-to-streamlining-your-javascript-and-jquery
[17:14:03] <grafi> you should watch paul irish's video on the jquery source
[17:14:42] <doug65536> clarkk: although I definitely don't recommend getting carried away with pre-minifying your source - that one is unintrusive

[17:16:07] <clarkk> nice tips, thanks doug65536 :)
[17:16:11] <clarkk> hehe
[17:16:18] <clarkk> SO Nazis! ;)
[17:16:39] <grafi> that escalated quickly
[17:17:56] <clarkk> grafi: haha, that wasn't directed at doug65536. it was an abbreviation - StackOverflow Nazis ;)
[17:18:13] <grafi> i know
[17:18:22] <grafi> still
[17:19:05] <pachet> anytime you have a large community of people and a lot of them are saying something's not constructive
[17:19:09] <pachet> it means it most likely is
[17:19:12] <pachet> unless its not
[17:19:31] <grafi> very helpful
[17:19:31] <pachet> i think some of the coolest so answers ive read have been closed ;[
[17:19:34] <grafi> xD
[17:20:01] <clarkk> pachet: hehe :)
[17:22:51] <doug65536> I just had an idea: how about if each person who closevoted it (5 people?) lost 10 points for every upvote in the questions and answers? and gained 10 for every downvote
[17:23:01] <doug65536> I bet their bully attitude would change real fast
[17:25:25] <doug65536> for a laugh, I think I'll post that on meta. it's like proposing a bill that slashes politician pay though :)
[17:26:40] <grafi> :P
[17:33:27] <clarkk> is there anything I can do here to optimise my code?  http://jsfiddle.net/QZ3Qp/2/
[17:35:34] <grafi> well you never use $self it seems so you might as well delete that line :p
[17:35:53] <clarkk> grafi: it is used
[17:36:08] <grafi> oh there
[17:36:12] <grafi> nevermind then
[17:36:12] <grafi> :P
[17:36:16] <clarkk> hehe
[17:36:26] <grafi> blinden by all the $$$
[17:36:30] <grafi> :P
[17:36:30] <grafi> *blinded
[17:37:05] <clarkk> well it is jquery - how can I avoid it? :p
[17:37:34] <doug65536> clarkk: your extension doesn't process an incoming selector?
[17:37:51] <clarkk> what do you mean doug65536?
[17:38:01] <doug65536> clarkk: where's this.each(function() { ...
[17:38:12] <doug65536> clarkk: what 'this' is line 18 referring to?
[17:38:30] <clarkk> doug65536: the methods I use work on a set of matched elements. each is not needed
[17:38:52] <doug65536> you hide them all and put click on them all?
[17:39:07] <clarkk> hide them initially
[17:39:23] <clarkk> they fade in when the vertical scroll reaches 40 from the top of the view
[17:39:32] <clarkk> um I mean ]page
[17:39:56] <doug65536> line 26 thru 29 are a test hack? that belongs after the plugin
[17:40:10] <doug65536> thru 30
[17:40:12] <clarkk> yes you are right. Sorry, I left that in by mistake
[17:40:23] <clarkk> please ignore that part
[17:40:42] <doug65536> clarkk: mostly looks pretty good
[17:40:58] <clarkk> http://jsfiddle.net/QZ3Qp/3/
[17:41:28] <clarkk> doug65536: so before I passed in the window and document, I was wondering where the most efficient place would be to select them....
[17:42:34] <doug65536> clarkk: using $(window) instead of $(this) might save a few characters after minifying (line 11)
[17:43:10] <PieCrumbs> speaking of minifying... anyone familiar with the require.js optimization process?
[17:43:48] <clarkk> doug65536: for example http://jsfiddle.net/QZ3Qp/4/  should I select,say, window before the scroll event handler, and assign it to a varible to use inside the handler. And also, how costly is it to keep explicitly wrapping an element in jquery - should I assign it to a var if I am
[17:43:49] <clarkk> going to wrap it ore than once?
[17:43:55] <clarkk> *more than once
[17:44:13] <doug65536> clarkk: oh one thing...
[17:45:03] <doug65536> clarkk: you already pass window in as a parameter that stays there forever (the showTopLink anonymous function closes over it
[17:46:28] <clarkk> doug65536: I actually took that out so that I could demonstrate these two queries I have about assigning selections and jquery objects to variables
[17:46:37] <clarkk> please see version 4
[17:47:57] <doug65536> having it in a closer scope might make a minuscule performance improvement (version 3 should be a tiny bit more cpu efficient)
[17:48:52] <doug65536> clarkk: there is actually a pretty significant problem though...
[17:49:27] <doug65536> clarkk: first, you should be namespacing your click handler
[17:49:48] <doug65536> clarkk: instead of .click, use .on('click.showTopLink', ...
[17:50:04] <doug65536> clarkk: also, your click handlers will accumulate
[17:50:22] <doug65536> you might want to do .off('click.showTopLink').on('...
[17:52:01] <92AAAEMC3> Hi all
[17:52:51] <greglz> Working through a jQuery upgrade to 1.8.3 and we've noticed that jQuery() is now quite a bit more strict about it's selector syntax
[17:52:57] <clarkk> doug65536: I don't understand how they would accumulate. Could you explain, please?
[17:53:24] <greglz> It used to accept bad strings like "[data-my-attr]=foo" where now it will throw an unrecognized expression
[17:53:33] <doug65536> clarkk: if the person using your plugin calls your .showTopLink 10 times, 10 click handlers will pile up
[17:54:06] <clarkk> doug65536: why would they do that tho?
[17:54:18] <doug65536> clarkk: because they are an idiot?
[17:54:31] <clarkk> they should just run it on a selection to set it up, and just leave it
[17:54:43] <doug65536> clarkk: it's your job to always work correctly. it's their job to fumble about and copy and paste etc
[17:54:53] <clarkk> heh
[17:55:19] <doug65536> clarkk: you should assume they are an idiot and prepare for the worst
[17:55:32] <doug65536> you are supposed to namespace your handlers in a plugin
[17:55:37] <greglz> I work on an app with a pretty rich plugin ecosystem and unfortunatly one of our top plugin devs has written selectors like the one I pasted, it's preventing us from upgrading
[17:56:06] <clarkk> doug65536: the namespacing is a good idea
[17:56:26] <doug65536> clarkk: they may not be an idiot... they might be doing something so complex that they feel they have to call it again "to make sure"
[17:56:47] <doug65536> clarkk: plugins are supposed to be able to tolerate that
[17:59:59] <doug65536> clarkk: imagine how awful it would be if it queued up a bunch of animations every time they clicked it. when they try to scroll it keeps fighting them
[18:00:31] <clarkk> ok doug65536. Is there a way to determine whether a click event handler has already been enabled?
[18:01:04] <doug65536> just do this.off('click.showTopLink').on('click.showTopLink', ...
[18:01:18] <clarkk> ah I see
[18:01:19] <clarkk> nice
[18:03:49] <doug65536> clarkk: another common thing is to optionally accept something else instead of settings
[18:04:12] <doug65536> clarkk: for example, you could add the ability to do $('#top-link').showTopLink('off') to disable it
[18:04:37] <doug65536> or 'disable' or whatever
[18:04:58] <doug65536> if you want
[18:05:28] <clarkk> doug65536:  how would I work that into my code? http://jsfiddle.net/QZ3Qp/6/
[18:05:45] <clarkk> ah, you mean if it's not an object?
[18:05:54] <doug65536> yeah...  1 sec
[18:06:02] <clarkk> OK I see what you mean
[18:08:42] <doug65536> clarkk: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QZ3Qp/7/
[18:09:26] <greglz> Anyone aware of a way to make jquery selectors more tolernat (like they were before the 1.8.3)?
[18:09:38] <greglz> tolerant**
[18:09:42] <doug65536> clarkk: or just return this.off...
[18:09:45] <clarkk> doug65536: that's neat! Thanks! :)
[18:13:00] <un5tab1e> Hello, anyone in here?
[18:14:11] <doug65536> !ask @ un5tab1e
[18:14:11] <b-ot> un5tab1e: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:14:40] <un5tab1e> Roger that. First time here :)
[18:14:53] <doug65536> greglz: what selector isn't working?
[18:16:45] <un5tab1e> Any one have any experience with SlickGrid? It seems pretty, well, slick but I can't get it working with with the newer jq libs.
[18:17:43] <un5tab1e> Seems like browser incompatibilities but fixing them is over my head.
[18:18:04] <greglz> @doug65536 "[data-something]=test". I know it's wrong, but I'd like to preserve compatibiltiy to give our plugin devs time to fix
[18:18:45] <doug65536> greglz: if you really want to fix it, you could override $.fn.find to handle that case
[18:19:10] <doug65536> greglz: I'll make demo
[18:19:18] <wrp6> Anyone aware of a slideshow/carousel plugin that, while displaying a particular image, slowly pans it over the container? (i.e. the container is smaller than the actual image)
[18:19:29] <greglz> @doug 65536 thanks, so are you aware of the actualy commits that changed this?
[18:19:37] <wrp6> pans it under*
[18:19:42] <wrp6> In the sense that overflow is hidden
[18:20:35] <doug65536> greglz: no, it uses proper css syntax now
[18:20:47] <clarkk> doug65536: when you are using event namespaces, is there still a need to use the .on() method on the same element, or is the namespace known globally?
[18:21:32] <doug65536> clarkk: if the user of your plugin wipes the click handlers, yours won't be removed (I think)
[18:22:09] <greglz> doug65536 overiding fn.find would only take care of jQuery("something").find("badshiz")
[18:22:17] <clarkk> what I mean is, when I want to remove them, is the namespace recognised globally (within my plugin)?
[18:22:23] <doug65536> greglz: jquery uses it for all selector lookups
[18:22:33] <greglz> just tested it locally and it did not
[18:22:35] <doug65536> clarkk: yes
[18:22:43] <doug65536> greglz: how
[18:23:08] <greglz> went to the jQuery website, opened chrome inspector and typed "jQuery.fn.find = function {console.log("find calld")};"
[18:23:26] <greglz> then tried jQuery("#test");, jQuery.find("#test");, and jQuery("#test").find("foo");
[18:23:29] <greglz> only the third logged
[18:23:30] <doug65536> well, you destroyed find. where does your code find anything
[18:23:44] <greglz> not verifying find still works, verifying it's being called
[18:23:46] <clarkk> doug65536: so $(window).off('scroll.mynamespace'); would remove the event even though I originally applied it to $('#myid').off('scroll.showTopLink');  ?
[18:23:53] <clarkk> ugh
[18:23:58] <greglz> the first and second still return valid jquery obj arrays
[18:24:12] <clarkk> I mean $('#myid').on('scroll.showTopLink');
[18:24:18] <clarkk> ugh
[18:24:26] <clarkk> hopefully you know what I'm getting at!
[18:25:12] <doug65536> greglz: works for me, what version of jquery are you using
[18:25:21] <doug65536> greglz: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/X7Zj8/1/
[18:26:29] <doug65536> clarkk: no, each element is separate
[18:26:55] <clarkk> ok. I presume you'd have to name the function/handler to remove them all in one go
[18:27:02] <greglz> doug65536, ah yeah, jQuery is probably aliasing those methods early and i'm doing it too late, thus only overiding the one that actually lives there now
[18:27:16] <doug65536> greglz: the later the better
[18:27:30] <doug65536> greglz: I doubt anyone is touching it
[18:28:06] <greglz> thanks doug65536, it'll be a bit ugly but it's good to see i can make this work
[18:28:23] <doug65536> greglz: well, ugly maybe, but at least possible
[18:41:32] <fdask> hey all... i'm dynamically creating elements, but want to make sure the positioning they are created in are valid with the dropabble params i've set up before creating... how can i do that?
[18:45:47] <petey> so i keep googling slider but that's not what I'm looking for.. pull out menu?
[18:45:56] <petey> I want to click on something in the middle of the page and have a menu "slide out" to that point?
[18:48:44] <nesoi> I'm using JQM and finding that taphold works sometimes, but then stops working. Any idea why that would happen or how to fix it?
[18:50:58] <doug65536> greglz: try this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/X7Zj8/14/
[19:04:20] <nesoi> why would .remove() not work on a listview?
[20:09:16] <guspollos> r
[21:29:55] <dcope> hey all, im using a template and can't figure out why i is undefined in this loop on the first pass http://pastie.org/private/jxegqijgxx2k817h6jveqa
[21:30:03] <dcope> there are 5 inputs and the first input name is book[pages][][index] yet the second and consecutive ones have their i value set properly
[21:30:10] <dcope> anyone have the slightest idea as to why?
[21:51:36] <RRR2> hm
[21:59:59] <zhulikas> hey fellas
[22:00:04] <zhulikas> question regarding jqgrid
[22:00:15] <zhulikas> I want to show a column in add form, but hide it in edit form
