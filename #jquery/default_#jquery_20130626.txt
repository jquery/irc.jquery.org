[00:02:34] <jayar> if i want to target an anchor within a certain div class, i do $('.classname a').thingy(); right?
[00:12:56] <Cork> jayar: yes
[00:13:15] <Cork> or if you already have a selector for the div you do variable.find('a')
[00:15:01] <dziegler> Hi i try to select all Checkboxes from a children div with the css class 'css_check_import' but i dont get the children div because jquery selecting me the parrent of my child? Thats my selector: jQuery(DivObject).children('div.css_check_import:checkbox');

[00:16:09] <soee> what would be the best way to get value of data-x attribute ? just use attr() ?
[00:16:22] <ravenzz> yep
[00:17:39] <soee> ok one more question thers no ready to use toggle method for readonly attribute ?
[00:17:46] <soee> i have to remove it and set again ?
[00:21:46] <soee> can i do in javascript: foo= bar ? true : false; ?
[00:23:55] <ravenzz> soee yes but that'd be silly since you can do foo = !!bar;
[00:25:01] <soee> ravenzz, i want to do something like this http://pastebin.com/5jWDUDnM
[00:25:11] <soee> atm not working
[00:25:44] <ravenzz> so you wanna toggle the readonly attr?
[00:25:57] <soee> ravenzz, yes
[00:26:15] <jayar> hmm... i can't get anything to even trigger...
[00:27:42] <ravenzz> soee try var elem = $("#" + id); elem.attr("readonly", !elem.is("[readonly]"));
[00:27:55] <ravenzz> brb
[00:31:57] <soee> ravenzz, ok got it working, i had wrong attribute name
[00:32:05] <soee> thank you for your help
[00:34:01] <Cork> ravenzz: don't use booleans with attr
[00:34:07] <Cork> thats for proc
[00:34:09] <Cork> opps
[00:34:14] <Cork> prop
[00:35:44] <soee> Cork, are you referring to the code he typed ?
[00:35:51] <Cork> yes
[00:36:05] <Cork> elem.prop("readonly", !elem.is("[readonly]"));
[00:36:06] <soee> and this shouldnt be done this way ?
[00:36:20] <Cork> just change attr to prop and it's fine
[00:36:32] <soee> Cork, attr is obsolate ?
[00:36:36] <Cork> no
[00:36:44] <Cork> but it is for changing attributes, not properties
[00:37:02] <Cork> (and attributes are always strings)
[00:38:57] <Cork> soee: basically attr('readonly', true) will create ex. <input readonly="true"> and thats wrong
[00:39:12] <Cork> soee: while prop('readonly', true) will create ex. <input readonly="readonly">
[00:39:20] <soee> Cork, ok now i get it
[00:45:47] <ravenzz> soee oh yeah my bad, sorry
[00:45:57] <ravenzz> attribute is a string
[00:46:00] <ravenzz> +the
[00:46:18] <ravenzz> Cork++
[00:55:51] <jayar> how would i search for a class on a page and add a class to each element with that class

[01:21:52] <Nemurenai> gavrochel, use $(".tables").on("click", "li", function(e)
[01:22:23] <Nemurenai> The problem is that you get the entire text content of the entire list because that's what your handler looks at

[02:24:07] <jammanbo> I have a method that performs a $ajax request and returns the xhr. In some situations I need to override that method so that it does not use $.ajax to get its data, instead the data is hard coded.
[02:24:15] <jammanbo> Assuming the consumers of these methods are going to invoke promise() on the return value and attach done callbacks etc., what should my "hard coded response" method return? Can I return some type of deferred object which will immediately run any done callbacks or something?

[02:38:52] <sejo> Abishek: that's not the way to do it then
[02:39:55] <Abishek> sejo, OK, defining the name with [] helps get the object as an array when doing a HTTP Post, what other way can you think of to do it?
[02:40:54] <sejo> Abishek: http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/htmlcheckboxes.php
[02:41:06] <sejo> use checkbox value

[02:53:39] <Abishek> Is there a way to redirect to a page and pass parameters without using query string?
[02:56:16] <MariusIT> Abishek, not that i know of, maybe using cookies ... idk
[02:56:26] <MariusIT> i would't do that
[02:57:47] <unCork> Abishek: is the redirect target the same server?
[02:58:23] <MariusIT> how can i stop this div container from breaking the script http://jsfiddle.net/4spE5/2/ ?
[02:59:21] <Abishek> MariusIT, unCork: Here is my problem. I have to do a Ajax Call and once it successfully completes the call, I need to redirect to parent page and show that the ajax call happened successfully. How should I deal with this?
[02:59:45] <unCork> MariusIT: closest('div').next()
[03:00:01] <MariusIT> unCork: ty
[03:00:29] <unCork> Abishek: you have two options, use json and pass the information to the client and let the client handle it
[03:00:42] <unCork> or set a server side session data
[03:00:52] <unCork> and use that on the redirected page
[03:02:00] <Abishek> unCork, I am returning the value from the ajax call as json, how do I pass that to a redirected page, feel session will be too much for this...
[03:02:25] <unCork> Abishek: you return the json back to the server and have a target: "url"
[03:02:32] <unCork> and the js makes the redirect call
[03:02:52] <MariusIT> unCork: var target = $(this).closest(".automarkup"); ?
[03:03:16] <unCork> ?.closest @ MariusIT
[03:03:17] <bot-t> MariusIT, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:03:41] <unCork> so no, it matches parents, not closest tag in a text stream
[03:04:21] <unCork> basically you have to account for the div, or use explicit targeting
[03:04:27] <unCork> (id's)
[03:06:40] <Abishek> can I change the action url of a form dynamically?
[03:09:20] <unCork> $('form').attr('action', 'new-url')

[04:03:08] <MariusIT> guys, any tips how to make this work? http://jsfiddle.net/4spE5/4/ i'm running out of ideeas
[04:07:51] <Richhh> MariusIT what is it supposed to do?
[04:10:34] <MariusIT> this http://jsfiddle.net/4spE5/5/
[04:12:19] <Skullclown> MariusIT: $(this).next(".automarkup"); outside of the <div> scope
[04:12:57] <MariusIT> i noticed, how can i include it in scope?
[04:14:10] <MariusIT> ignore prev question
[04:14:17] <MariusIT> how can i make it work even outside scope?
[04:20:50] <Skullclown> MariusIT: because of the div, it becomes $(this).parent().next(".automarkup");
[04:21:04] <Skullclown> but those without div won't work because of .parent()
[04:22:56] <lemonsparrow> hi all
[04:23:43] <Skullclown> MariusIT: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14035206/jquery-find-next-element-that-is-not-a-sibling
[04:24:15] <boo> hi! is there a way that you would recomend for cancelling a timeout function in the mouseleave event if the mouse is hoverd on the element back again? http://pastebin.com/tYD4p1nm
[04:24:59] <Skullclown> boo: clearTimeout ?
[04:25:43] <boo> Skullclown, well, I'm trying to use it, but it seems that the way I'm implementing it, is not correct..
[04:26:06] <Skullclown> var bar = setTimeout(function() { foo(); }, statusTimeout);
[04:26:06] <Skullclown> clearTimeout(bar);
[04:28:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hi
[04:28:26] <seutje> MariusIT: http://jsfiddle.net/4spE5/6/
[04:28:45] <seutje> if there's no siblings, grab the ones from the parent, otherwise, just use the regular siblings
[04:29:11] <Skullclown> boo: I just took a quick look, your mouseleave is iterating and setting element but when you mouseenter you never set element? so the last element in $(this).children('ul').each() is the one you'll be using in mouseenter.
[04:29:14] <Skullclown> is that on purpose?
[04:29:35] <EnderMB> Hey all. Let's say I have a variable with a string (e.g. "tab1"), and a jQuery variable with a collection of anchor tags. How can I grab a single anchor tag where the href attribute is the same as the string?
[04:30:05] <seutje> $collection.filter('[href=' + theString + ']')
[04:30:31] <EnderMB> seutje: Ah, I thought I tried that and it didn't work. I'll give it a try again, thanks
[04:30:34] <seutje> or $collection.filter(function() { return this.href == theString; }); or something like that
[04:31:12] <seutje> second is prolly faster
[04:32:10] <Bauer> Guys, I have this products filter based on jQuery here: http://devstore.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=VirtualMachines_Filter_Test (code is on https://store.ccccloud.com/static/store-skins/new_general/css/js/vmWizard.js) - my problem is, that .change event for the checkboxes activates the function separately for every change (which is good). But I need to somehow make it "accumulate" clicks,
[04:32:10] <Bauer> and do the call once - so that if say, a person clicks on 3 things within 2 seconds, the filter will be activated once. Currently if you do 3+ clicks fast, you could sit down and watch how each queued call is performed separately.
[04:32:22] <Bauer> I have no idea how to do this... any suggestions?
[04:32:22] <boo> Skullclown, not sure if I got your idea, but the idea is that, if you close an element you have to close it's childs, but when you open an element, you just open the specific element, not it's childs.
[04:32:29] <lemonsparrow> I have a div with lot of sibling elements... I want to build this entire div using jquery. How can I do this ?
[04:32:52] <seutje> holy global scope batman!
[04:33:33] <seutje> Bauer: debounce is prolly what ur looking for

[04:34:04] <reloadz> hi! can anyone help ne with selectors?
[04:34:43] <Skullclown> boo: what I'm saying is, you're using the var 'element' in mouseenter to clearTimeout(). however, var 'element' is only set in mouseleave, in that loop. so it'll always be clearing the same (last) element but it won't touch the rest.
[04:35:41] <reloadz> I have no amount of divs... so how can I select specific div... for instance I need to select div that is nr 18 among those n amount of divs?
[04:35:51] <reloadz> no..... n*
[04:36:10] <boo> Skullclown, that's reasonable. Well the point that you made! :)
[04:37:34] <seutje> lemonsparrow: here u go :D http://jsfiddle.net/LkVv7/1/
[04:38:08] <seutje> reloadz: $('div').eq(17)
[04:38:23] <seutje> or $('div')[17] if u just need the DOM element
[04:38:57] <reloadz> it starts from 0?
[04:38:59] <seutje> or $('div:eq(17)') also works, I think
[04:39:05] <seutje> yeah
[04:39:11] <reloadz> thx for help :)
[04:39:11] <seutje> `jqapi eq
[04:39:18] <seutje> ?eq
[04:39:18] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[04:39:45] <seutje> it's annoying when trying to emulate css things like nth-child, as that is 1-indexed
[04:39:55] <lemonsparrow> seutje: no the point is a lot of values there are dynamic
[04:40:17] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I want the dom to be build using jquery and then I use AJAX to insert value into it
[04:40:28] <lemonsparrow> seutje: the values u saw in fiddle were hardcoded...
[04:40:29] <seutje> lemonsparrow: u could just replace those with variables, but you're probably looking for a templating solution, right?
[04:41:08] <Skullclown> go handlebars
[04:42:11] <lemonsparrow> Skullclown: yeah
[04:42:41] <lemonsparrow> seutje: if u see http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/LkVv7/2/ there is a pattern and almost most of the stuffs are repeating and values are changing
[04:43:05] <lemonsparrow> seutje: so I want something like an append method which accepts parameters and I could reuse them
[04:43:20] <seutje> `g jquery tmpl
[04:43:21] <b-ot> seutje: BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl · GitHub → https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl
[04:43:30] <seutje> lemonsparrow: yeah, so templating
[04:43:44] <seutje> like $('#template').tmpl(data)
[04:43:52] <lemonsparrow> seutje: can we do it using plain $.append() could u help me.. no need of any plugins
[04:44:30] <Bauer> thank you seutje, that is exactly what I wanted :) great that I dont have to reinvent the wheel
[04:44:35] <seutje> wll, u can write ur own templating function, but that will probably be less performant and stuff than things people have been using for a while
[04:45:18] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I need only use append.. and I feel I can write a method and reuse it since most of the stuffs are repeating... need ur help in getting the method
[04:45:29] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I am not too well versed in jquery
[04:45:36] <seutje> this is making less sense by the minute
[04:45:45] <seutje> u wanna use append, which is a method, but u also wanna write a method
[04:47:15] <lemonsparrow> seutje: see I cant use append() for each line write.. i mean I can.. but instead if I write a method and reuse it for most of the repeating  stuffs it will save lines of code
[04:47:30] <MariusIT> seutje: thank you
[04:49:13] <lemonsparrow> seutje: u there bro ?
[04:49:29] <seutje> usually
[04:50:03] <lemonsparrow> seutje: can u help me with that method using append ?
[04:51:57] <lemonsparrow> seutje: ?
[04:52:21] <seutje> I'm making it as a template
[04:52:45] <lemonsparrow> seutje: thanks
[04:53:02] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I hope there wouldnt be any 3rd party plugin/library involved
[04:53:20] <seutje> u mean... like jQuery?
[04:53:36] <seutje> I'm not writing a custom traversal library for this shit o.O
[04:55:02] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I mean Jquery is ok..
[04:55:06] <lemonsparrow> seutje: pls continue
[05:01:44] <lemonsparrow> seutje: done bro ?

[05:06:34] <seutje> decypher
[05:07:03] <lemonsparrow> seutje: oh... really sorry pls continue
[05:07:49] <sammich> I'd have accepted decipher
[05:08:49] <Cork> boo: it depends on if the function expects to get a list of elements or one at a time
[05:09:45] <boo> Cork, well, what I want to do, is to hide all descendants
[05:09:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: where have you been bro :) glad to see u after long
[05:09:55] <seutje> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/LkVv7/3/ here, didn't add all the rows, but u get the idea how easy it is to add stuff
[05:10:12] <lemonsparrow> seutje: many thanks for ur time
[05:10:16] <lemonsparrow> seutje: will look into it now
[05:10:27] <Cork> boo: $('body > ul > li ul').hide() ?
[05:10:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: been busy
[05:11:04] <sammich> so, I noticed that in the 'Try jQuery' game/thingy, it seemed to want us to use .find() a lot instead of using the css decendants
[05:11:34] <lemonsparrow> seutje: the html part should have been in the js part ryt ?
[05:11:46] <sammich> does jQuery parse that stuff to do that internally or does it throw it off to doc.querySelector?
[05:11:50] <seutje> lemonsparrow: doesn't rly matter
[05:12:20] <seutje> sammich: it's cause selectors are evaluated right to left
[05:12:41] <seutje> $('#foo .bar') -> look for .bar and check if it's in #foo, discard the ones that aren't
[05:13:00] <sammich> so the find narrows the scope before proceeding
[05:13:17] <seutje> $('#foo').find('.bar') -> look for #foo and check its descendants for .bar
[05:13:41] <seutje> look for #foo means getElementById, which is crazy fast as u can imagine
[05:14:12] <seutje> it depends heavily on the structure and how you're traversing, but generally find is the best bet
[05:14:44] <sammich> sounds like forcing it down a certain path
[05:14:45] <seutje> just remember to cache ur shit and don't go $('#foo').find('.bla'); $('#foo').find('.meh'); $('#foo').find('.pee'); ...
[05:15:00] <boo> Cork, well the descendants should be under $(this)
[05:15:30] <seutje> instead, var $foo =  $('#foo'); $foo.find(...); $foo.find(...) ...
[05:15:38] <boo> Cork, shouldn't $(this).find('ul').each(function() { mouseleave(.... work?
[05:15:43] <sammich> hah, of course. rule of thumb: if you're gonna use it >2x, store a reference to it
[05:15:48] <seutje> (except when u intentionally want to re-evaluate the document for that selector)
[05:15:50] <Cork> uh no
[05:16:05] <Cork> why would you have mouseleave in an each call?
[05:16:15] <Cork> or is that a function you create your self?
[05:18:14] <sammich> yeah, I'm still learning the best practices for jQuery/JS
[05:18:21] <sammich> which is why I joined this channel
[05:18:46] <Cork> well $(this).find('ul').each(mouseleave) should work just fine too
[05:19:00] <Cork> as long as the function expects to get the arguments each provide
[05:19:57] <lemonsparrow> hmm
[05:20:59] <seutje> sammich: some might say best practice for JS is not using jQuery
[05:21:01] * seutje hides
[05:21:35] <sammich> hah
[05:21:54] <sammich> if I want to write my own set of poorly researched and optimised utilities
[05:22:45] <sammich> jQuery does 95% of the job
[05:23:00] <sammich> getting the 5%, would take double the time
[05:30:28] <Skullclown> sammich: but while executing, your self-written code is easily 70% faster :P

[05:38:41] <sammich> jQuery 1.4.2 :|
[05:39:01] <Skullclown> document.getElementById() vs $('#id') isn't apples and oranges thuogh
[05:39:02] <Skullclown> though *
[05:39:29] <ajpiano> either way it's hundreds of thousands of apples or oranges per second
[05:39:33] <seutje> yeah it is
[05:39:39] <seutje> they don't result in the same thing
[05:39:49] <sammich> okay...so now what
[05:39:52] <ajpiano> JS and DOM performance are rarely the bottleneck in modern webapps
[05:40:10] <seutje> it's them 17 custom unoptimized fonts that kill me
[05:40:23] <ajpiano> anyhow i have to get off this train
[05:40:25] <Skullclown> except for mobile support but then I wouldn't really recommend jquery
[05:40:35] <seutje> ajpiano: it's obviously bound for derailing
[05:42:01] <seutje> I'ma ride it out till the end! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRrPiWo8Pt4&t=0m5s
[05:42:04] <sammich> so the biggest bottleneck for jQuery is for selection?
[05:43:01] <seutje> doubt it, manipulation is usually heavier than traversal, but depends on the app ofc
[05:43:24] <sammich> well. damn, I'm the one building the JS libraries at work. I'm not teaching my colleages another API
[05:43:36] <seutje> davzie: how come u can't access it, it's supposed to be exposed as a global object...
[05:44:03] <seutje> davzie: are you trying to store a reference before your plugin was initialized?
[05:44:20] <davzie> seutje: Nope, if I reference it inside my plugin it dies :(
[05:44:29] <maruitz> $(this).stop().animate({ height: "200"}, "fast"); how do I animate it downwards?
[05:44:32] <seutje> davzie: got an example I can look at?
[05:44:39] <maruitz> like a slidedown
[05:44:41] <davzie> hahahaaaaaa
[05:44:43] <davzie> My bad
[05:44:57] <davzie> seutje: Sorry mate, I mad mis-typed the path to the Galleria script!
[05:44:59] <davzie> What a dick
[05:45:03] <seutje> lol
[05:45:28] <seutje> always check the console
[05:45:44] <sammich> if I get comissioned to build the next Google Docs webapp, I'll skip jQuery. But for now...
[05:48:38] <seutje> maruitz: either use top margin or position relative and top and animate that in reverse to the height animation
[05:55:25] <maruitz> soutje: when can we expect jquery to add a slidedown function to animate?
[05:56:02] <Cork> heh
[05:56:04] <Cork> http://i.minus.com/ibimw6bd4Flhd9.gif
[05:56:08] <Skullclown> maruitz: .slideDown() ?
[05:56:44] <maruitz> Skullclown: don't work on animate
[05:56:53] <maruitz> it only slides upwards
[05:57:10] <Skullclown> maruitz: but why don't you use .slideDown() instead of .animate() ?
[05:57:26] <maruitz> Because I have a div with 50px, when hovered I want it to expand to 200
[05:58:00] <sammich> am I missing something?
[05:58:15] <seutje> Cork: lol
[05:58:46] <dpiwowarski> Hi
[05:58:57] <seutje> maruitz: LOLWAT?
[05:59:46] <maruitz> not sure what you are after, a manual?
[06:00:30] <seutje> maruitz:  (function(){ var oldAnim = $.fn.animate; $.fn.animate = function(lol) { if (lol === 'slideDown') { return this.slideDown(); } else { oldAnim.call(this, arguments); } } })(jQuery) ?
[06:00:45] <seutje> there, now u can .animate('slideDown') and it'll just call slideDown for u
[06:00:54] <Skullclown> :P
[06:01:21] <Skullclown> I love the effort that went in writing that code. seutje
[06:01:21] <seutje> any more crucial functionality jQuery is missing?
[06:02:11] <seutje> omg I didn't return on the oldAnim call :x
[06:02:21] <maruitz> brace
[06:03:08] <sammich> yup, this is #jquery alright
[06:04:45] <dpiwowarski> I use load function to get some div by an ajax request. In this div i got a link. In the main document I'm handling click events by $(document).on("click", "a", function(event){}). In this function i'm determing the action based on the class name of the caller. Do this by: event.taget.getAttribute('class'). The problem is when i click the link from ajax, i can't get the class. event.target.getAttribute('id') return null
[06:06:17] <dpiwowarski> do you know how to get the class name of the clicked link, which was loaded by load function?
[06:09:06] <sammich> omg, I just found out that jQuery uses vanillaJS!
[06:10:30] <seutje> dpiwowarski: erm, is it the ID or class u want?
[06:11:19] <dpiwowarski> both
[06:11:35] <dpiwowarski> when i get the class name i might need the id also
[06:12:42] <seutje> yeah, can't recreate the issue
[06:13:19] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/QxG8Y/
[06:13:45] <wcwrel> lol vanilla js
[06:21:44] <sweb> i want to design jquery plugin. i this plugin have many html codes. i need to design plugin, it's a stnadrd way to add html codes into my js code or not. if not jquery dose have any template processing for this ?
[06:21:49] <MariusIT> how can i add a "if target != this then do something" condition in this http://pastebin.com/4XV5s45T ?
[06:22:07] <sweb> i need to have right pattern for write jquery plugin with complex html
[06:23:01] <seutje> MariusIT: if (!$(e.target).is(this)) {}
[06:23:22] <seutje> (after u pass e to the handler of course_
[06:23:23] <seutje> )
[06:25:19] <MariusIT> damn, dosen't work as expected :(
[06:25:34] <Thoams> tried giving my handler e one time, I got sectioned again... :(
[06:30:23] <sammich> arschmitz: got a jQuery Mobile question for you
[06:30:47] <seutje> Thoams: that handler better have been of age!
[06:30:56] <arschmitz> sammich: shoot
[06:31:08] <sammich> how do I set and update a slider value?
[06:31:33] <sammich> okay, I know how to do it
[06:31:54] <arschmitz> sammich: $("#slider").val("99").trigger("change");
[06:31:59] <sammich> but when I call it inside my update_view function, it freaks out
[06:32:28] <Skullclown> sliders, recommended .val(99) or val("99") ?
[06:32:43] <arschmitz> does not matter
[06:33:53] <sammich> oh
[06:34:02] <sammich> I realise what I'm doing wrong ;)
[06:34:17] <arschmitz> sammich: ok
[06:34:48] <sammich> if I use .change(), that triggers the handler that called it in the first place ;)
[06:35:18] <sammich> I tried used .slider('refresh'), or just no arg
[06:35:34] <sammich> with 'refresh' it totally kills the tab and the inspector too
[06:36:09] <MariusIT> can i do something like this http://pastebin.com/1E31QzxR ?
[06:37:08] <arschmitz> sammich: refresh should work but the slider right now does have a few issues. we are planning a full rewrite for 1.5
[06:37:25] <arschmitz> sammich: mostly to simplify and improve performance
[06:38:02] <sammich> so, I'm gonna have to prevent this loop when using .change() to update the widget then
[06:38:42] <sammich> I'll just set a data-attribute or something hacky
[06:55:28] <RyanD_> items_to_toggle = $("#form_content").find(this).attr("id"); is there a way I can do this where it only finds elements where the ID is not undefined?
[06:56:56] <RyanD_> http://jsfiddle.net/QYA9y/
[06:57:14] <RyanD_> There's the complete function (yes, aware it's a wonky way of doing things, kind of on a time crunch and inherited a messy base)
[06:57:30] <RyanD_> Just trying to make it more efficient, as in certain cases it gets VERY laggy
[06:58:12] <EnderMB> Hey all. Does anyone here use a constants file for constant strings in their JavaScript? I use one for Java and C# code and I'd like to do something similar for my JS. Anyone know of a good way of doing it and then referencing?
[07:01:35] <Skullclown> RyanD_: have you tried #form_content[id=''] ?
[07:03:58] <RyanD_> hmm?
[07:10:36] <shoky> RyanD_: .filter('[id]') i suppose
[07:11:03] <shoky> RyanD_: notice that .attr() only returns the attribute for the first matched element
[07:12:55] <Skullclown> oh my bad, I thought RyanD_ was asking to only get empty ids
[07:12:58] <wcwrel> EnderMB, why not just create a new .js file for each language
[07:13:47] <wcwrel> and have langobj = {foo:'This is english Foo', bar: 'This is english bar'....}
[07:16:45] <EnderMB> wcwrel: The main reason I want a constants file is so I can separate the selector strings, so I can reuse them and make the code a bit cleaner
[07:20:07] <_jo_> What's the recommended CSS book for people with a pretty solid grasp of Javascript and HTML?
[07:22:44] <nysos> hey, needed some help, i am newbie to jquery and trying some code
[07:23:02] <warrenparsons> _jo_: Eric Meyer's "CSS: The Definitive Guide" is probably the most comprehensive reference in paper form. He's working on a 4th edition now.
[07:23:24] <_jo_> Awesome.  Thanks.
[07:23:54] <warrenparsons> _jo_: MDN is my favorite online reference.
[07:24:23] <seutje> just print out the spec and staple it
[07:24:57] <warrenparsons> _jo_: Only takes seutje's advice if you're a masochist. And you hate trees ;)
[07:25:22] <_jo_> I have a kindle, so I can use that.  :D
[07:25:25] <_jo_> Save trees!
[07:25:27] <seutje> he has a solid grasp of HTML and JavaScript, how can he not be a masochist? :P
[07:25:34] <warrenparsons> Good point.
[07:25:47] <nysos> i am using jquery ui and creating two tabs , but when i am trying to use a function to create random password by a button click the page is refreshed and tab1 is selected and the information on tab 2 which was filled earlier is lost. pls can anyone help me
[07:27:18] <nysos> i am referencing oriely jquery ui but can't find any information to do what i need
[07:28:15] <nysos> anyone ? Pls need help
[07:31:25] <shoky> nysos: what do you need?
[07:33:18] <nysos> well i am creating two tabs using jquery ui but on btton click tab 1 is selected everytime
[07:33:34] <nysos> how can i stop it,
[07:35:48] <nysos> i mean after selecting tab2, where i have a button which craetes a random password for registering a user,
[07:36:36] <nysos> on button click for random paswd generation, tab1 is automatically selected
[07:37:55] <shoky> either dont reload/redirect the page
[07:38:06] <shoky> and do whatever you're doing with the password, with ajax
[07:38:31] <shoky> or if you reload/redirect,, you'll need to save some session data in the browser or server
[07:38:50] <shoky> first option is probably nicer
[07:39:21] <shoky> another option is that i didnt understand what you mean, so make a jsfiddle/demo that shows your issue
[07:40:04] <nysos> ok
[07:42:37] <nysos> hey shoky, i really don't know about jquery so i wanted to ask, is there any rule to where to include the jquery script for it to work?
[07:43:20] <Saaether> can go in the header or the bottom of the body
[07:43:47] <Saaether> best practise is bottom of body
[07:44:00] <nysos> in one code it only worked when i included it inside the same form
[07:44:15] <shoky> nysos: what Saaether said
[07:45:11] <shoky> nysos: and of course, it has to be included before any code that uses it
[07:46:20] <nysos> ok
[07:48:15] <nysos> then including the script in the head should always work ?
[07:49:19] <Saaether> yes
[07:50:51] <c4ptnh00k> mornign gents
[07:50:56] <c4ptnh00k> morning*
[07:53:28] <nysos> adding the jquery.js and jquery-ui.js files in the head is not working and only working when it is at the end of the body.
[11:54:34] <c4ptnh00k> nysos: Is this a question?
[11:54:36] <Saaether> nysos: you're doing something wrong then, cant say without seeing the code but it should def work in both places
[11:55:59] <nysos> can you take a look at my code and tell me where to use jquery scripts exactly ?
[11:56:23] <Saaether> like i previously said, best practise is at bottom of body
[11:56:26] <Cork> actually it should work in head, and not everything should work in bottom
[11:56:49] <Cork> jquery does bindings that needs to be loaded before the body is parsed
[11:58:05] <nysos> well adding jquery.js and jquery-ui.js at the head is fine, but the my javascript file should be at the bootom ?
[11:58:26] <Saaether> your js file should be after where ever you put the jquery and jquery ui files
[11:59:13] <c4ptnh00k> um i didnt think it mattered where you put "your" scripts just the libraries
[11:59:26] <Saaether> if they use jquery it sure does =P
[12:00:23] <c4ptnh00k> if i put a <script> stuff </script> in the body it will work the same as if i add it right after the libraries in the head though
[12:00:43] <BillCriswell> nysos: You can't call your own scripts in the head unless you wrap it in a document ready dealie.
[12:02:24] <nysos> thanks BillCriswell , i didn't knew that
[12:03:50] <nysos> does it matter where it is respected to the element whose id it is using ?
[12:04:45] <c4ptnh00k> ... maybe im mis understanding you guys, but you can place your scripts anywhere you want. in the body.. it's a functional language...
[12:05:19] <c4ptnh00k> libraries are bound at page load ok but besides that
[12:05:46] <MariusIT> i've been trying for hours now, how can i include the commented condition into this script http://jsfiddle.net/Pj7gZ/ ?
[12:05:51] <Saaether> c4ptnh00k thats fine if you loaded jquery in your header, but if you have it at the bottom of your body you cant have a script in your body that uses jquery before it is loaded
[12:06:20] <CiE> Hey guys i'm trying to get TypeHead.js to prefetch data from a json url that my server produces, but for some reason i don't think it's liking the JSON reply it's getting is there something i am doing incorrectly?
[12:06:21] <c4ptnh00k> Saaether: Agreed. Ok I get what you are saying and agree lol sorry
[12:07:26] <jayar> when i use this, it just removes the content from the a title="", and doesnt show it in the tooltip... $('.eventful a').cluetip({arrows: true, cluetipClass: 'rounded'});
[12:08:36] <c4ptnh00k> MariusIT: if($(this).hasClass("automarkup"))
[12:09:17] <c4ptnh00k> MariusIT: but you have no html mockup so i didnt test it
[12:14:23] <MariusIT> c4ptnh00k: http://jsfiddle.net/Pj7gZ/2/ added html
[12:15:08] <MariusIT> http://jsfiddle.net/Pj7gZ/3/
[12:16:54] <Saaether> MariusIT http://jsfiddle.net/Pj7gZ/4/ ?
[12:18:14] <MariusIT> no, codebox is fixed
[12:18:41] <Saaether> i dont know what your trying to do, i just added in the has class condition
[12:18:55] <MariusIT> aha,   $(this).slideUp(); needs "all other divs containing that class" condition
[12:19:34] <MariusIT> just trying to create a not so simple slidetoggle with multiple textareas
[12:27:23] <joe-c> good afternoon
[12:31:56] <joe-c> I'm trying to modify the supersized.js plugin to work within a div element (rather than just on the body). It works if I hard code the name of the target div in the plugin but when I try and use $(this) it's not working. Can anyone advise please? Pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/KL1Lb26c it's line 17 where I'm trying to get the name of the element which it's been called on (in html $('#green').supersized(); ) Thanks
[12:33:23] <joe-c> I guess a more simple version of the question is: if a plugin is called using $(element).plugin() how do you get the element within the plugin :)
[12:36:04] <shoky> joe-c: answer to your last q is "this"  but it's in $.fn.plugin   not $.plugin
[12:36:24] <shoky> joe-c: see line 920
[12:36:38] <joe-c> oh so i'll need to pass it from  $.fn.plugin to $.plugin
[12:36:54] <shoky> yep
[12:37:07] <shoky> (i guess. didnt rly look at the code much)
[12:38:33] <joe-c> ah yep
[12:38:41] <joe-c> my bad - passed it and it works fine
[12:38:52] <joe-c> looks like issues having more than one on a page now though lameeee
[12:41:23] <jayar> $('.eventful a').cluetip($(this).attr('title')); returns the title of the whole page... how do i get it to return the title of .eventful a link?
[12:42:13] <shoky> jayar: $('.eventful a').each(function() { $(this).cluetip( this.title ) })
[12:42:54] <str8uplinux> any reason why my regex isn't matching? http://jsfiddle.net/pvDNZ/3/
[12:43:56] <shoky> str8uplinux: yes
[12:44:32] <shoky> str8uplinux: your regex looks for 1-3 digits followed by a dot, followed by 0-1 digits
[12:45:01] <shoky> you probably meant to add a ? at the end (before the $)
[12:45:40] <str8uplinux> shocky: ahhhh, wow. haha
[12:45:52] <str8uplinux> sometimes you just need another set of eyes
[12:45:54] <str8uplinux> thank you
[12:46:29] <jayar> thnx shoky
[12:49:42] <stewbydoo> having some issues here
[12:49:42] <stewbydoo> http://codepen.io/stewbydoo/pen/qwCGz
[12:50:05] <stewbydoo> for some reason when I hover over html it jumps
[12:50:13] <stewbydoo> could use another set of eyes on this
[12:50:18] <stewbydoo> thanks in advance
[12:57:01] <shoky> stewbydoo: you mean when you move the mouse out of the view and back in from another place?
[12:57:41] <shoky> stewbydoo: that's to be expected.. you're using the pageX/pageY of the mouse event, after all..
[12:57:48] <stewbydoo> well when you run the codepen then go into the iframe it jumps
[12:58:07] <stewbydoo> shoky, well got any other suggestions?
[13:00:35] <shoky> i wouldn't worry about it myself, really.. unless you plan to show it in an iframe like that?
[13:01:30] <stewbydoo> well I will give it a go and see what happens
[13:01:55] <shoky> if you change the way it works so that it never jumps.. you'd have to mess with the "strength" dynamically too
[13:02:15] <shoky> so that if my mouse is on the right side, then i take it out of the view and back in from the left side.. and then drag it right
[13:02:35] <shoky> the strength would need to be much weaker for that drag, but then go back to normal.. it'd just be weir
[13:02:36] <shoky> weird
[13:02:47] <shoky> leave it ;p
[13:03:45] <shoky> (and if you dont mess with the strength, then it'd enable the user to keep dragging right and then re-entering from the left, and he'd be able to pan the image all the way eventually, also weird
[13:03:48] <shoky> )
[13:09:52] <snowyrooftops> Hi!
[13:10:05] <snowyrooftops> I've been trying to get a file upload to work with jquery-mobile but can't seem to get it working :-(
[13:10:22] <snowyrooftops> I've tried data-ajax=false and disabling ajax for forms, but still doesn't work
[13:26:03] <wjziv> Is anyone around that can help me with a problem I'm having with parent-deletion?
[13:27:10] <arschmitz> wjziv: can you be more specific?
[13:27:22] <wjziv> Awesome--Just wanted to make sure there was someone on.
[09:28:15] <wjziv> So, I'm creating something that, when a form is completed, it takes the inputs and fills out a table
[09:28:22] <wjziv> Creating a new row with each submission
[09:28:34] <wjziv> Each row has a delete button, to remove its corresponding row
[09:29:05] <wjziv> The problem is, let's say you have 50 current rows, and you enter one more, -only- that last row is able to be deleted.
[09:29:38] <wjziv> This happens for any amount--after the submit button is pressed, the newest-added row is the only one that's able to be removed.
[09:29:49] <wjziv> Should I just copy/paste my code, here?
[09:29:50] <arschmitz> ok
[09:29:54] <arschmitz> no
[09:30:04] <arschmitz> use a gist or jsbin or something made for code
[09:34:52] <DannyZB> http://pastebin.com/4BpaqPzx
[09:34:59] <DannyZB> why does this code misbehave ?
[09:35:00] <wjziv> https://gist.github.com/wjziv/2ae0640ff3fc538496c7
[09:35:16] <wjziv> Sorry I took so long, arschmitz
[09:35:19] <DannyZB> on chrome all the progress updates are sent only to the first item on the list
[09:35:29] <DannyZB> and sometimes the browser just aborts the ajax call
[09:36:34] <DannyZB> all data passed in ajax calls is always correct , I double checked that
[09:57:01] <Sirisian|Work> Is there a way to call a function on a node in the DOM? $("#foo").??(function() { $(this). }); ?
[10:02:54] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: i'd use  $( $.parseXML(xml) )
[10:03:00] <zfly9> Hey guys I have an anchor link from a page that I want to link to a separate page, which is fine, but the content is in jQuery accordions, is there a way to link to an accordion and have it opened?
[10:03:30] <shoky> Sirisian|Work: and you don't need each, donno why you think you do
[10:04:25] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, Well I'm just executing with the scope of the node so the code is easier to read. The node has a lot of entries.
[10:04:45] <Sirisian|Work> what did you mean by  $( $.parseXML(xml) ) ? I've never seen that before. what's it do?
[10:05:18] <shoky> $.parseXML  parses xml into an xml document object
[10:05:28] <shoky> $(...) wraps it in a jquery object
[10:05:35] <shoky> so you can call jquery methods on it
[10:06:20] <shoky> if you just do $(xmlString)  you'll get nodes for the <?xml..?> crap and bare text nodes in between tags
[10:06:29] <Sirisian|Work> shoky, ah yeah I'm doing that already
[10:06:53] <shoky> k.. lemme know if you need smth else
[10:07:12] <shoky> (cause your other questions werent too clear)
[10:09:01] <zfly9> anyone?
[10:11:18] <mreq> Any chance of getting jQueryUI dragable+droppable to work accross different divs? Need to drag something from sidebar and drop it in content.
[10:12:48] <shoky> mreq: sure. you might wanna look at the appendTo option of draggable
[10:14:32] <shoky> zfly9: i don't think there is anything built-in that'll do that for you, at least not in the latest jqui version
[10:15:49] <GaryOak_> I'm trying to make a table sortable using jui but the css isn't working when I move stuff, anyone know how I can fix it?
[10:16:21] <mreq> shoky: Thanks, I'll look into that. The other funny part is making SVG elements droppable :D
[10:18:05] <shoky> GaryOak_: maybe, if you provide a minimal testcase/jsfiddle/demo/link
[10:27:01] <GaryOak_> nvm, thanks though, it seems to be a css issue and not a jquery issue
[10:27:37] <jedimind> oh that css!
[10:28:00] <mentoc> css is sexy.. it rounds corners
[10:28:05] <JCadle> ^
[10:28:51] <jedimind> rounded corners are imporatnt
[10:28:54] <jedimind> also, important
[10:29:12] <GaryOak_> also <blink> tags are important
[10:29:28] <jedimind> thats not css, but i'll allow it
[10:30:09] <GaryOak_> how about marquee with css controls
[10:33:03] <elfman> hi guys - any google map experts out there ? i am trying to use the  jquery.ui.map plug in embeeded in an accordian widget, i want the map to refresh centered on the new coordinates with each click, but it doesnt seem to work  http://jsbin.com/ozufos/1/edit     thanks!
[10:50:36] <elfman> newbie question - hi guys - any google map experts out there ? i am trying to use the  jquery.ui.map plug in embeeded in an accordian widget, i want the map to refresh centered on the new coordinates with each click, but it doesnt seem to work  http://jsbin.com/ozufos/1/edit     thanks!
[10:54:12] <guideX> if I have an input and wish to find the label sitting next to it...
[10:54:16] <guideX> closest isn't doing it
[10:54:45] <guideX> this isn't finding it... var label = $(this).closest('label');
[10:55:51] <guideX> oh wait sibbling is doing it, thx anyways :)
[10:57:04] <graphettion> Wish I had relatives to do my code.
[10:59:38] <shafox> how to do copy to clipboard ? Is there any plugin out there which i can implement straight away without installing ruby or something. need a pure JavaScript/jQuery .
[11:00:01] <myosotis> not easily
[11:00:32] <shafox> myosotis, but the project copy on the jquery plugin site does that work ??
[11:00:39] <shafox> its looking outdated to me
[11:01:10] <graphettion> shafox: You mean like this? - http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[11:01:50] <chilversc> shafox: it looks like there's a draft spec for it, but nothing exists yet that I know of http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipop/
[11:02:29] <shafox> chilversc, that one is a 404 page for me
[11:02:36] <graphettion> me too
[11:02:43] <shafox> graphettion, yeah something like that , but it uses flash
[11:02:50] <shafox> does it have to use flash
[11:02:52] <shafox> ??
[11:03:02] <chilversc> odd, I copied it straight from my browser http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipops/
[11:03:15] <chilversc> ah, in the lag I dropped the s
[11:03:25] <shafox> yeah now working
[11:04:20] <chilversc> hmm, though not sure that lets you actually put things on the clipboard, only monitor it for when the user copies/cuts within the web page
[11:04:42] <shafox> that is my only requirement
[11:04:53] <graphettion> shafox: http://zeroclipboard.github.io/ZeroClipboard/ This too. I don't think you have to use flash, not sure though.
[11:05:33] <shafox> graphettion, it uses ruby i think
[11:05:57] <graphettion> shafox: Ah, that's the only one's I know of. Sorry man.
[11:06:00] <chilversc> shafox: no, that uses flash to handle the clipboard
[11:06:03] <guideX> if I'm in a foreach li loop, and need to do some ajax to get data back from the server, which is better, calling the server via ajax multiple times and setting the data-item to the data value from the server, or gathering the id's and calling the server once, then going through the li loop again and setting data-item on each li?
[11:06:14] <graphettion> Yeah, chilversc is right.
[11:06:18] <guideX> say I have 2-6 li's
[11:07:06] <shafox> thanks man
[11:07:08] <chilversc> though don't forget to make an actual visible element for the flash element
[11:07:10] <shafox> graphettion,
[11:07:28] <chilversc> otherwise people with flash disabled can't enable it (eg, I have click to enable)
[11:07:51] <zfly9> Hey guys I have an anchor link from a page that I want to link to a separate page, which is fine, but the content is in jQuery accordions, is there a way to link to an accordion and have it opened? Is there anyway I can append 'display:block" to an element once it's clicked over?
[11:08:00] <graphettion> chilversc: Good source. Thanks!
[11:08:01] <chilversc> guideX: one round trip to the server is normally better, as it has less overhead
[11:08:09] <guideX> thought so, thanks
[11:08:21] <graphettion> http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipops/#clipboard-event-interfaces is pretty neat.
[11:08:40] <chilversc> guideX: until the responses start getting larger, and at some point it becomes better to do 6 individual responses but with decent caching and longer time outs (so if the browser has requested it recently it doesn't re-request)
[11:08:51] <guideX> oh these are small responses
[11:08:58] <guideX> like 2-3 lines of text
[11:10:52] <shafox> chilversc, what do you mean by actual visible element for the flash element ?
[11:11:04] <shafox> didnt get you
[11:11:38] <chilversc> shafox: as in something clickable
[11:11:53] <chilversc> shafox: that zeroclip by default has no display for the flash part of it
[11:12:00] <shafox> i just want to put a link in a input box and a copy to clipboard option
[11:12:16] <shafox> ohh ok
[11:12:33] <chilversc> shafox: right, but many people block flash (eg, I have it set as click to enable)
[11:12:45] <chilversc> shafox: if it isn't visible, you can't click it
[11:12:54] <shafox> yeah for that only i didnt wanna use flash based
[11:13:23] <chilversc> shafox: the best I did was have a button that selects all the text, then the user can copy
[11:14:03] <shafox> yeah that is a workaround chilversc
[11:16:20] <elfman> newbie question - hi guys - any google map experts out there ? i am trying to use the  jquery.ui.map plug in embeeded in an accordian widget, i want the map to refresh centered on the new coordinates with each click, but it doesnt seem to work  http://jsbin.com/ozufos/1/edit     thanks!
[11:19:36] <Guest91905> hello . can some one help me getting the text of a parent <li> when child <li> is clicked? here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/UN69H/4/
[11:21:27] <Saaether> Guest91905 http://jsfiddle.net/UN69H/5/
[11:21:56] <mentoc> if I do $("#foo").change(my_func); function my_func(ele){ /* ele is an object */ } but ele is not a jquery object.
[11:22:21] <mentoc> by "jquery object", I mean it doesn't have the jquery methods

[11:37:55] <JFranks> I want to take a div in an iframe, get the .html() or .val() (? whatever is the same as innerHTML?), save that to a var, then nuke the iframe, and append a div, with the contents of the div I fetched earlier as the contents of the appended div..
[11:43:31] <JCadle> JFranks, var iframe_html = $('iframeselector').html(); $('iframeselector').remove(); $('<div />').appendTo('body').html(iframe_html);
[11:44:10] <Guest91905> how can I register my username ?
[11:46:55] <oojacoboo> could someone have a look at this in getting this to work… http://jsfiddle.net/ApPD8/6/
[11:47:44] <oojacoboo> or http://jsfiddle.net/ApPD8/7/ rather
[11:49:58] <stephen_camilo> Hello folks
[11:50:52] <stephen_camilo> does anyone have idea of how this could bem possible:
[11:50:52] <stephen_camilo> http://www.apple.com/br/mac-pro/
[11:53:00] <oojacoboo> stephen_camilo: svg
[11:53:47] <oojacoboo> very impressive svg animation work
[11:54:06] <joe-c> Could somebody try something for me - if you resize the window from, say, 1024 wide to a lot bigger (using firefox) but do it very quickly, do you end up with grey margins on the edge? http://www.projectsimply.com/examples/fullscreen.html
[11:54:44] <_jo_> Checking, Joe.
[11:55:46] <stephen_camilo> joe-c:
[11:55:47] <_jo_> joe-c: Not quite gray, but if I resize I can see white outside of the picture.
[11:55:58] <stephen_camilo> why dont you use backstrech?
[11:57:50] <joe-c> hi stephen - hmm that looks interesting but I need to have 3 on the page, each the width and height of the viewport and resizng when the viewport is resized
[11:58:26] <joe-c> Oh I see, just use JS to make the divs the width and height and then let backstretch do the rest?
[11:58:30] <joe-c> thanks _jo_
[11:58:48] <stephen_camilo> set img margins to 0 then
[11:59:38] <stephen_camilo> joe-c http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/
[12:00:24] <oojacoboo> for the record, you have to extend the constructor prototype :/ - http://jsfiddle.net/ApPD8/8/
[12:07:08] <Tigt-Out> is this the place to ask for help with implementing jquery?
[12:07:38] <joe-c> stephen_camilo: I'll have a go with backstretch, thanks :)
[12:09:37] <stephen_camilo> joe-c: you're welcome!
[12:10:14] <user2345> I am trying to learn jquery. I am almost halfway through the book "Pro jquery". Can anyone here point me to any open source jquery projects where I can use whatever I am learning form the book? Thanks.
[12:23:02] <joe-c> stephen_camilo: you are a genius, sir, backstretch worked perfectly :)
[12:27:39] <stephen_camilo> joe-c: thanks a lot!
[12:28:39] <dllama> hi guys
[12:29:10] <dllama> can someone please point me in the right direction of ONLY including swipe gestures from jquery mobile ?
[12:30:21] <dllama> seems jquery mobile doesn't play very nice with rails, so when i disable autoInitializePage, :delete methods dont work, when i leave it on, it tries to convert my site to mobile and completely breaks the esthetics of its .
[12:30:32] <arschmitz> dllama: you need 3 files
[12:30:49] <dllama> jquery_rails, jquery_ujs and jquery_mobile.  far as i can tell. correct?
[12:31:07] <arschmitz> jquery.mobile.vmouse.js jquery.mobile.support.touch.js and touch.js
[12:31:11] <arschmitz> from jquery mobile
[12:31:14] <dllama> ahh
[12:31:49] <dllama> i thought u were talking about somethign else.  will certainly try that now.  thanks a million!  (very sad to say that so far i've dedicated about 4 hours to this and have cursed jquery from head to toe lol)
[12:31:58] <joe-c> i'm trying to make an entire box act as a link (there is a link in the box but its not big enough) - I've used the click function to call the click function of the link, can i use the hover event of the box to call the hover function of the link too? it doesn't seem to work
[12:32:09] <joe-c> I'd like the link hover state to show when the box is hovered over
[12:32:32] <arschmitz> dllama: anything from jquery mobile uses amd so you can just look at the define at the top and it list everything it depends on
[12:33:41] <dllama> arschmitz, would u happen to know where i can grab those 3 files from?
[12:33:48] <arschmitz> github
[12:34:05] <arschmitz> thats where all jquery projects keep their source
[12:34:15] <jedimind> the hub of gits
[12:34:22] <dllama> right, found their repo
[12:34:44] <arschmitz> dllama: jquery mobile also has a download builder
[12:34:50] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[12:35:05] <arschmitz> dllama: just select touch and it will make a custom build that does just that
[12:35:13] <dllama> hmm, i didn't see that before.  searched thorugh the site.
[12:35:19] <dllama> been a very stressful day thusfar :0
[12:35:41] <dllama> so all i'm selecting from there is touch?
[12:35:53] <dllama> events => touch
[12:36:13] <arschmitz> yes it will automatically select any thing else that is required
[12:36:57] <arschmitz> dllama: just so you know the swipe event has been changed for 1.4 to fix some issues and make it more responsive
[12:37:13] <arschmitz> this is not released yet but if you get from master on github it is there
[12:37:26] <dllama> going to test with 1.3 first to see how it works
[12:37:52] <arschmitz> dllama: do you intend on ever unbinding the event?
[12:38:48] <dllama> swiperight event?
[12:38:54] <dllama> well swipe events
[12:39:07] <dllama> well i need to figure out how to make it conditional based on screen resolution
[12:39:19] <arschmitz> dllama: yes after you bind them do you intend on ever unbinding them?
[12:39:52] <dllama> only when screen resolution is outside of what bootstrap defines as phone/tablet
[12:40:27] <dllama> haven't fully wrapped my brain around how to do that.
[12:41:29] <dllama> was thinking of something like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/54715681e82b88cf9497
[12:42:03] <dllama> i forgot to add teh part where on each swipe event i'm checking if(var = 1){swipeevent}
[12:42:14] <dllama> but i'm a bit concerned if thats going to create a lot of overhead
[12:42:26] <Tigt> Would someone be willing to help me with the jQuery UI resize function?
[12:44:07] <Tigt> I'm having issues with getting the helper box to appear
[12:44:55] <blindMoe> can you stick your code in to jsfiddle.net or codepen so we can see?
[12:45:11] <Tigt> is pastebin acceptable, or would you prefer one of those two options?
[12:45:18] <blindMoe> nah pastebin sucks
[12:45:25] <Tigt> alright one moment
[12:45:34] <blindMoe> specially for js stuff... we can play with it in either jsfiddle or codepen if you paste it in there correctly
[12:45:54] <guhcampos> Why is my data.fluxos undefined on this code: http://pastie.org/8083607
[12:46:18] <guhcampos> btw that gives me a "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined "
[12:47:13] <Tigt> blindMoe: how do I properly paste in the javascript? I figure I ought to include the jquery library link but it's telling me not to use HTML
[12:47:47] <blindMoe> on jsfiddle you do it in the left column under the 'Framework and Extensions' tab
[12:47:55] <blindMoe> ther eis a drop down where you can select jQuery
[12:48:18] <blindMoe> then under External Resources you can add jquery UI and the CSS file needed
[12:48:23] <Tigt> oh excellent
[12:48:26] <blindMoe> I would recommend pasting the relevant CSS int he CSS box though
[12:50:20] <Tigt> how do I acquire the share link for this fiddle?
[12:51:00] <Tigt> ah ha, never mind: http://jsfiddle.net/ESRTu/
[12:55:42] <Tigt> the helper box would be particularly useful for resizing the livestream player, as it needs to reload the iframe every time you resize it
[12:56:02] <Konda> Hey! I'd like to build an image slider with a fade effect, does anyone know where to find a guide, or some page where I can get started?
[12:56:20] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/54715681e82b88cf9497 do u guys think thats a reliable way of disabling swipe for anything other than mobile/tablet ?
[12:56:36] <dllama> and do u guys think it'll create a lot of overhead checking htat on each event?
[12:58:24] <blindMoe> Konda: just look at the code of an existing one... check out Flexslide or Cycle2
[13:00:03] <blindMoe> Tigt: you are missing a } in your CSS just before the .ui-resizable-helper  declaration in your CSS
[13:00:14] <blindMoe> Tigt: [12:58:04] _dc_ [~dc@163.192.21.72] has quit IRC: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[13:00:19] <blindMoe> arg son of
[13:00:25] <blindMoe> no idea how it copied that
[13:00:33] <blindMoe> Tigt: http://jsfiddle.net/ESRTu/1/
[13:00:33] <Tigt> oh god, that's embarassing
[13:00:34] <blindMoe> there you go
[13:00:41] <Tigt> thank you, that was a silly mistake
[13:00:42] <blindMoe> it happens
[13:00:44] <blindMoe> np
[13:01:04] <Tigt> it does seem to be still having an issue with the resizing of the chat iframe though
[13:02:24] <Tigt> oh wait, no it doesn't
[13:02:26] <Tigt> excellent
[13:02:30] <Tigt> thank you for your help
[13:05:55] <Konda> alright, thanks for the tip blindmoe!
[13:06:29] <blindMoe> Konda: not sure why you would want to write your own unless you have a very specific need that an existing slider does not offer
[13:08:02] <Konda> no, it was just for learning purposes, but Im gonna try to find an existing one now
[13:08:15] <blindMoe> ahh well you can create a fader in just a few lines of code
[13:08:29] <blindMoe> I have written quite a few for learning purposes so I would recommend it if you have the time
[13:08:44] <Konda> yeah, Im gonna find one and do small adjusments ;)
[13:08:53] <Tigt> does the draggable option only work on elements with specific CSS positioning? it doesn't appear to do much with absolutely positioned elements
[13:08:59] <blindMoe> Konda: there is a small version of Cycle2 that works well
[13:09:21] <Konda> just googled cycle2, found quite a few of different sliders
[13:10:35] <Tigt> I've updated the fiddle after my attempt to include drag functionality to the three big elements of the page: http://jsfiddle.net/ESRTu/
[13:10:44] <Konda> this is the one I want: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/prevnext.php, but I want one picture to be in the center and the previous and next on the sides faded and maybe abit smaller ;)
[13:10:47] <Tigt> the [|||] buttons are supposed to be the handles
[13:11:07] <Tigt> well now that's odd
[13:11:09] <Tigt> it works in the fiddle
[13:11:13] <Tigt> but not on the web page
[13:12:16] <Tigt> http://curios-channel.tumblr.com/watch
[13:14:31] <Tigt> I must have changed something when I split it up iinto its components for the fiddle, but I can't find what
[13:19:07] <Bloomberg> Hi gus!!
[13:19:23] <Tigt> is it because the dropdown version of jquery and the one I linked in the page are different?
[13:19:35] <oojacoboo> can you pass an object to $.data() ?
[13:19:49] <Bloomberg> Someone know if with fullcalendar I can to change the color of event according the date received?
[13:20:03] <Tigt> yes, it is
[13:20:08] <Tigt> wow, I'm just full of simple mistakes today
[13:20:26] <Tigt> oh, wait, hm
[13:21:08] <Tigt> nevermind!
[13:21:15] <Tigt> thanks for you help, blindMoe!
[13:25:52] <zsoc> Im trying to work on someone elses code... they seem to using a function which doesn't exist - `sumIds = sumIds.diff(partIds);` <-- trying to use this imaginary "diff()" function to remove what is in the partIds array from the sumIds array. Is there such a thing in an add-on lib he was using? My googlefu couldn't find it.
[13:27:18] <toshiba> hi all...
[13:27:31] <toshiba> i need a responsive design to my website....
[13:27:55] <toshiba> what do i need to do?
[13:28:21] <zsoc> What a detailed question.
[13:28:31] <zsoc> Use bootstrap?
[13:31:17] <shoky> zsoc: maybe he has code somewhere that defines .diff() ?  e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/a/4026828/1098884
[13:32:11] <zsoc> shoky: maybe, but no one in this repo -,- i didn't know if it was like a standard function in some add-on lib i couldn't find
[13:32:15] <zsoc> I assume there's no other good way to do this?
[13:33:03] <shoky> to do what
[13:33:43] <zsoc> Remove the duplicate values of Array2 from Array1
[13:34:21] <zsoc> Basically grabbing stuff in batches and want to remove the current batch, pushes 10 into Array2, then after the ajax mess, wants to remove those 10 from Array1 and keep the loop going.
[13:35:32] <shoky> lotsa libs have a way to do that.. or youcan make your own
[13:38:53] <zsoc> so like the _difference() function from the underscore lib
[13:43:43] <Bloomberg> I have a problem with this plugin
[13:43:48] <Bloomberg> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[13:44:04] <jedimind> so go ask them ?
[13:44:09] <jedimind> you paid for it, go get support
[13:44:23] <Bloomberg> I don't know why doesn't works, and show me $(...)datetimepicker is not  function
[13:44:44] <Bloomberg> And I'm including according the user guide
[13:44:52] <jedimind> its $(…).datetimepicker
[13:47:08] <jedimind> i know! lets keep guessing!
[13:47:08] <jedimind> rather than you showing us code
[13:47:08] <Bloomberg> jedimind: Yes, but that is the error
[13:47:08] <jedimind> then youre doing it wrong.
[13:47:08] <JFranks> JCadle: Hmmm.. I'm a noob.. so var iframe_html = $('iframeselector').html(); $('iframeselector').remove(); $('<div />').appendTo('body').html(iframe_html); would get me started but then I'd want to grab a div inside that iframe data and do another swap.. if I can't just grab the div to start with (the iframe is filled in by the browser I guess?)
[13:47:08] <oojacoboo> .datetimepicker() maybe?
[13:48:54] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/grAQG/
[13:48:56] <Bloomberg> is simple!
[13:49:41] <oojacoboo> Bloomberg: http://jsfiddle.net/grAQG/1/ ??
[13:50:10] <Bloomberg> oojacoboo: What?
[13:50:21] <oojacoboo> display: "" ?
[13:50:28] <oojacoboo> reset to default
[13:55:44] <karlmh> hey folks
[13:55:49] <karlmh> how is everyone?
[14:09:11] <defaultro> hey folks, is it possible to have a jquery using either class or value?
[14:10:37] <defaultro> $('input[name=usertype][value=admin]').prop('checked', true) <- this code is ok but what about this
[14:11:19] <guhcampos> http://pastie.org/8083607 - why is data.fluxos undefined here? the array is there =/
[14:13:50] <defaultro> check this out folks, http://jsfiddle.net/7VUhD/
[14:15:00] <defaultro> the [value="Admin X"]' is actually dynamically created. The value is taken from a database. Unforunately, the value is different from the HTML value
[14:15:33] <lmao24> How come the .loading doesn't fadeOut on line 23?? http://pastie.org/8083882 (if i do it manually in console it works)
[14:16:03] <Bloomberg> hi
[14:22:00] <JFranks> I want to get the 'html' of a div inside the only iframe on a page..  var iframe_html = $('#ifrm').contents().find("#content_main").html;  does not work.. but I have to be so close?
[14:22:46] <JFranks> The iframe is id="ifrm" and the div is id="content_main" ..
[14:23:11] <JCadle> .html() not .html
[14:23:17] <JFranks> Ahhh..
[14:24:09] <JFranks> No error on that run.. now to see why it fails..
[14:25:32] <JFranks> Ahhh  iframe_html = undefined ..
[14:25:36] <JCadle> if your var is empty its because it's not finding a #content_main in the iframe, because ur doing it right.
[14:26:31] <JFranks> Hmmm the 'xpath' is //*[@id="content_main"]
[14:28:02] <JCadle> console log just the iframe's html and you'll find there's no #content_main as it wouldnt return undefined if that selector was in the iframes contents()
[14:29:13] <JFranks> Yeah the log is empty.. not undefined.. but empty..
[14:30:54] <Bloomberg> hi
[14:31:01] <JFranks> You need to attach an event to an iframe's onload handler, and execute the js in there, so that you make sure the iframe has finished loading before accessing it.
[14:41:56] <JFranks> If $(document).ready(function() { ... waits till the document is loaded.. would $(#ifrm).ready(function() {}); wait till the contents of an iframe with id="ifrm" finishes loading?
[14:49:21] <JFranks> Newp.. That's not the problem.. even waiting 5 seconds, I can't get the console to see the contents of the iframe.. but jquery has no problem selecting it for a remove();
[14:49:44] <thomasgriffin> I can't get  the change event to trigger when manually setting a select box option via jQuery
[14:50:25] <thomasgriffin> here is the relevant code - can someone tell me what I doing wrong here?
[14:50:26] <thomasgriffin> https://gist.github.com/thomasgriffin/5d890f934aa13c1db767
[14:50:55] <JFranks> Ahhh.. .contents() returns an object.. oooh..
[14:53:23] <thomasgriffin> anyone? I am stumped on this one
[14:54:29] <thomasgriffin> omg - didn't realize I couldn't trigger change before i had set the original event - doh!
[14:54:43] <thomasgriffin> moving code after the event change action worked fine
[14:56:07] <audiotek> hey guys, quick question with selectors
[14:56:20] <oojacoboo> it's like css
[14:56:47] <JFranks> hahaha.. most people stumped on selectors are stumped on CSS ;)
[14:56:48] <pemulis_work> lul
[14:56:48] <audiotek> I want to target a span that begins with a certain id
[14:57:03] <audiotek> $ajaxResponse = $(span[id^="UpdateResponse"]).children();
[14:57:35] <JFranks> $('span#UpdateResponse')  ?
[14:57:48] <oojacoboo> audiotek: what's wrong with what you have?
[14:58:21] <zsoc> Im driving myself nuts. How do i output the return of a function to console.log? I'm just getting "function()". I'm just trying to get something simple like console.log($("#allids").val);
[14:58:34] <audiotek> Ahhh wait I have an idea.. I could use the same id and remove it from th edom
[14:58:51] <JFranks> oojacoboo: probably the same error I get cause the element is empty at time of execution?
[14:59:22] <oojacoboo> oh didn't see a testcase
[14:59:29] <lethjakman> hey, I have a <select> that I want to change with jquery, but I want to trigger the onchange. is there a way to do that?
[14:59:38] <pemulis_work> When I do a post request with jQuery.ajax() of a complex object I get array notation- how do I get dot notation instead
[14:59:43] <pemulis_work> for example: ldapusers[0][groups][]:CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=rough,DC=ad,DC=com
[15:00:08] <pemulis_work> I want ldapusers[0].groups.[0]:CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=rough,DC=ad,DC=com
[15:00:20] <cheesypoof20> .trigger('change')
[15:00:42] <JFranks> zsoc: var consolestuff = $("#allids").val; console.log(consolestuff); ?
[15:01:28] <JFranks> zsoc: assuming the issue isn't just '.val()' vs. '.val'
[15:02:14] <ldexterldesign> hey
[15:02:21] <JFranks> for horses
[15:02:29] <ldexterldesign> anyone spare 5 mins to help me debug something?
[15:02:54] <JFranks> Sorry but you've used your max questions per day.
[15:03:11] <JFranks> You should just ask. ;)
[15:04:18] <ldexterldesign> @jfranks appreciate your candor :P
[15:04:22] <audiotek> man.. this place has so much more ppl compared to JSF
[15:04:26] <audiotek> lol
[15:06:11] <ldexterldesign> @jfranks https://gist.github.com/ldexterldesign/5872163
[15:06:22] <JFranks> Actually everyone talking right now is just me with a personality disorder.. and lots of proxies.
[15:06:34] <ldexterldesign> anyone identify what's wrong with this snippet https://gist.github.com/ldexterldesign/5872163 ?
[15:07:20] <snover> so many things
[15:07:29] <JFranks> You're debugging an error dialog? That's too recursive for me.
[15:07:35] <snover> what prize do i win
[15:07:37] <lethjakman> cheesypoof20: sweet! didn't know about that!
[15:07:46] <lethjakman> what's the easiest way to set the select to the first one with jquery?
[15:07:55] <lethjakman> just grab the first child? or is there a cheater method.
[15:09:50] <ldexterldesign> @jfranks i'm just working with what i see. i don't have to provide a solution, just give some idea of what may be wrong
[15:10:34] <ldexterldesign> @jfranks just getting into OOP JS, so a little lost ATM
[15:11:04] <oojacoboo> how do you do non oop js?
[15:11:13] <cheesypoof20> I'm not sure I understand you @lethjakman but perhaps .first()
[15:11:40] <lethjakman> cheesypoof20: with a <select> how do I set the selected element to the first one?
[15:12:11] <ldexterldesign> @oojac... i'm an interface developer, can usually get by scripting
[15:12:42] <oojacoboo> lethjakman: $("select option:first").prop("selected", true); //IIRC
[15:16:37] <shoky> ldexterldesign: if you want help debugging that, provide a demo/jsfiddle reproducing the issue
[15:18:12] <cheesypoof20> In the done function call in http://jsfiddle.net/xt36y/1/ what should I be using: .find() or .filter() and .contents() or .children(). I'm confused because on one website I have .filter() working and on another I need to use .find() because .filter() returns nothing...
[15:19:10] <Forbidd3n> How would I remove all but first and second option?
[15:19:10] <Forbidd3n> .children('option:not(:first)').remove()
[15:20:08] <shoky> Forbidd3n: .children().slice(2).remove()
[15:20:30] <Forbidd3n> that would remove the first 2 right?
[15:20:41] <Forbidd3n> I want to remove all but first 2, unless I am reading it wrong
[15:21:02] <zsoc> I'm having an issue where my code is continuing but I need it to chill out till the code in the success function of an ajax call is done. Is there anyway to 'lock up' the rest of the code until the success function of the ajax request returns? (it's in a .each loop). It's dataType:json if that matters
[15:21:07] <rodney757> I am using an ajax call to check if a file size is to big to be uploaded. How can I keep the input file when the page is reloaded via successful ajax call?
[15:21:19] <shoky> cheesypoof20: that depends on the returned html.  btw it's safer to use $.parseHTML to parse arbitrary html
[15:22:22] <ldexterldesign> @shoky sorry dude, i don't have that - i've just been given access to the ticket and code snippet - any hunch?
[15:22:23] <shoky> zsoc: do what you want to do in the callback
[15:22:39] <ldexterldesign> shoky: sorry, new IRC too ;)
[15:22:48] <shoky> ldexterldesign: i dont know what the problem is, so no, no hunch
[15:22:57] <Forbidd3n> shoky: thanks
[15:23:08] <Forbidd3n> I guess I should just tias next time
[15:23:28] <ldexterldesign> shoky: i've put the error in the comment at the top of the snippet https://gist.github.com/ldexterldesign/5872163
[15:23:54] <shoky> ldexterldesign: but you haven't put the code that throws that error
[15:24:39] <Foxhoundz> huh?
[15:24:44] <Foxhoundz> Who dinged me
[15:24:46] <Foxhoundz> oh
[15:24:49] <Foxhoundz> wall
[15:24:53] * Foxhoundz goes back to work
[15:25:30] <cheesypoof20> @shoky the returned html is simply the same form html but with error classes inserted on the input/textarea elements. no idea on the .filter() vs .find() issue?
[15:25:43] <zsoc> shoky, a callback function? but wouldn't that still just happen at the end of the success function? Basically I need to make it syncrnous so the code doesn't continue until the ajax call returns... because the loop then continues and my values are wrong for some vars because the values are set in the success function
[15:26:22] <shoky> ldexterldesign:  IE doesn't support writing to the console if the IE devtools are closed.. maybe that has to do with it i donno..
[15:26:31] <breck7> is there a pattern to bind/unbind a lot of listeners eaasily? like, instead of writing $(document).on('foo', doSomething) then adding a matching $(document).off('foo', doSomething), some pattern to do that in a block or something?
[15:26:44] <breck7> if i have like 20 listeneres
[15:26:46] <ldexterldesign> shoky: it's an IE8 bug, so i'm hopeful something in that code will stand out as being IE8 specific
[15:26:53] <breck7> is there a good way to do it so i dont need 40 lines of code?
[15:27:09] <shoky> cheesypoof20:  the returned html just has  <form...>..</form>  ?
[15:27:12] <ldexterldesign> shoky:ahh, interesting
[15:27:32] <ldexterldesign> shoky:i will suggest that - thanks kindly
[15:28:19] <cheesypoof20> i said that poorly; the entire html page is returned but there are differences in the <form>...</form>
[15:28:25] <JFranks> Ahhh the iframe is now my bish.. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#ifrm').load(function(){ var iframe_html = $('#ifrm').contents().find('div#content_main').html(); $('#ifrm').remove(); $('div#srch').append(iframe_html); });});
[15:29:22] <cheesypoof20> so I merely want to find this updated form and place its contents in the old one
[15:29:49] <shoky> cheesypoof20: safest bet is to do:   $('<div>').append( $.parseHTML(data) ).find('#form')
[15:31:00] <shoky> cheesypoof20: if you want more info on why filter/find doesn't work on one of your sites, paste the full returned html of both
[15:33:20] <shoky> breck7: maybe you want event namespaces e.g. $(document).on('foo.mynamespace', fn);   $(document).off('.mynamespace')
[15:33:58] <breck7> shoky: interesting! thinaks, will look into it
[15:34:01] <breck7> thanks*
[15:35:37] <kyan> Hello! I'm new to jQuery, and am working on a website: http://futuramerlin.com/  I want the .slideup div to appear when .trigger (the "Projects" link) is clicked. I'm trying to get it to animate sliding in from the bottom, and then eventually I want to add a close button to hide it again. Any thoughts on what I'm missing?
[15:35:40] <lethjakman> when I use a jQuery.each it's returning javascript objects instead of jquery. why is that? how do I fix it?
[15:35:57] <lethjakman> oojacoboo: ooo thank you!
[15:36:02] <shoky> zsoc: paste your code so its easier to see what exactly you wanna do
[15:36:31] <shoky> lethjakman: $(this)
[15:37:05] <shoky> or $(element)
[15:37:41] <shafox> how can i do a validation when submit button clicks using jquery validation pulgun. here is the html http://paste.ubuntu.com/5803064/  the problem is when the submit button is clicked the value is transfered through a jquery ajax call , how to add form validation here in this type
[15:38:09] <zsoc> shoky, I need to make an ajax call synchronous, and i can't because i'm using dataType:json. So I need a work around.
[15:38:37] <shoky> zsoc: see my last comment
[15:39:27] <shoky> zsoc: whatever you put in the callback won't be executed until the ajax request is done
[15:40:47] <Forbidd3n> How do you toggle something hide/show based on filter?
[15:40:47] <ihelpsu> I STILL DIDNT FINISH LEARNING JS since i have no current need for it -- BUT i did find you the best jquery books out there http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Hotshot-Dan-Wellman/dp/1849519102 // http://www.amazon.com/Murachs-JavaScript-jQuery-Zak-Ruvalcaba/dp/1890774707 -- they need more ratings to verify reliabilty though

[17:20:55] <Rodrigo_Debian> someone tell me why when I click a file that contains a calendar made in jquery it opens and calendar access and when it inside the www folder and access my website pulling it, the calendar disappears?
[17:21:44] <sammichToo> your references to files are probably wrong
[17:21:50] <sammichToo> either way, inspector is your friend
[17:22:51] <Rodrigo_Debian> example: file :/ / / var/www/teste/jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom/oioi.html (OK!)
[17:23:29] <Rodrigo_Debian>   http://localhost /teste/jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom/oioi.html loads but the calendar does not
[17:24:20] <Rodrigo_Debian> how to straighten it?
[17:24:38] <sammichToo> use relative references to your files
[17:25:28] <sammichToo> if it's in the same folder it's just "jquery.js"
[17:25:52] <Rodrigo_Debian> just download a calendar in jquery edited it all in the download folder it loads. if set it to the folder of my site if it loads in file :/ / .... if web-site as it opens but the calendar does not
[17:26:12] <Rodrigo_Debian> That is the problem with jquery because my site opens normally
[17:27:25] <sammichToo> paste your html into jsfiddle.net

[17:55:25] <shoky> now you feel awesomer with your hardon
[17:55:37] <EwokFartPorn> :O
[17:55:57] <mnero> is it possible to use jquery mobile as a library (e.g. for mobile dialogs and widgets) and not follow its page structure requirements (the framework)?
[17:56:09] <tw2113> just lost it after twitter showed me the chance to purchase ad space
[17:56:17] <arschmitz> mnero: partially
[17:56:39] <mnero> arschmitz: go on
[17:56:43] <arschmitz> mnero: right now many of the widgets depend on the page structure
[17:57:06] <arschmitz> mnero: you dont need the nav or any of that but the page structure is needed for many
[17:57:17] <arschmitz> mnero: but not all it depends on exactly which widget
[17:57:24] <mnero> i see
[17:57:33] <arschmitz> mnero: this is however being fixed for the new 1.4 version
[17:57:40] <mnero> nice
[17:57:42] <mnero> when is that due?
[17:57:50] <arschmitz> alpha will be mid july
[17:57:54] <Rodrigo_Debian> shoky
[17:58:17] <Rodrigo_Debian> Please what should I do now to solve this problem?
[17:58:48] <Rodrigo_Debian> just give permission 777 to the folder and all files relaiconados and still the problem persists
[17:58:53] <shoky> Rodrigo_Debian: fix your apache and/or file permissions
[17:59:13] <arschmitz> mnero: normally its about 1 month from alpha to final
[17:59:32] <mnero> arschmitz: cool, so it's actually pretty soon
[17:59:39] <arschmitz> mnero: yes
[18:00:14] <mnero> my situation is I made a mobile app with jquery ui widgets, which while they generally work, they are shaky and break in some older mobile browsers
[18:00:23] <arschmitz> we are finishing up work in next couple weeks so we can release the alpha
[18:00:39] <mnero> so I want to replace the widgets, but since the app is already built, fitting it all into a framework would not be ideal
[18:00:59] <Rodrigo_Debian> already gave chmod 777 for all folders that I downloaded to run this calendar. gave even to specific files. what else do I need?
[18:01:07] <arschmitz> which widgets did you have troube with from ui and which ones did you want from mobile
[18:01:44] <mnero> dialog is the big one. It triggers a cryptic bug on android 2.3 that causes selects to freeze
[18:01:52] <mnero> multi-select is another
[18:02:00] <mnero> also breaks on android 2.3
[18:02:07] <mnero> not sure if mobile has a replacement for that one though
[18:02:27] <shoky> Rodrigo_Debian: #httpd
[18:02:35] <arschmitz> mnero: yes we have popup similar to ui dialog and select / custom select for multi select
[18:02:49] <arschmitz> both work on 2.3
[18:03:57] <arschmitz> mnero: i however can tell you that neither of those work without pages in current 1.3 version
[18:04:39] <Rodrigo_Debian> how to give permission to run apache jquery?
[18:06:07] <mnero> i'm also using a jquery ui calendar on mobile, which is pretty shameful
[18:06:07] <mnero> though it works
[18:06:27] <arschmitz> mnero: i have an extension for datepicker for mobile
[18:07:02] <mnero> arschmitz: alright, so my best bet is probably to wait for the next release
[18:07:17] <arschmitz> mnero: i just wrote it last week so its not in a repo yet but will be soon http://jsbin.com/uzaret/848/edit
[18:07:26] <arschmitz> mnero: datepicker will not be part of 1.4
[18:07:36] <mnero> arschmitz: for the other 2 things I mean
[18:07:42] <arschmitz> mnero: yes
[18:07:44] <mnero> datepicker I may be able to use now
[18:07:49] <arschmitz> for those youu will have to wait
[18:08:05] <mnero> alright, thank you for the very good info
[18:08:48] <arschmitz> mnero: if you are worried about mobile and want a datepicker i strongly suggest looking at that jsbin as it uses mobile styles that are tested on mobile
[18:10:02] <mnero> arschmitz: opened it on my android 2.3 phone and it works gloriously
[18:10:32] <mnero> arschmitz: does it have to stay inline in the page like that or can it pop out upon selection?
[18:11:25] <arschmitz> must be inline
[18:11:36] <arschmitz> popup does not work well on android
[18:11:42] <arschmitz> or any mobile really
[18:11:54] <mnero> so I've noticed
[18:15:08] <e563e57> hum... If i declare once in my html the jquery ready function, then fill some div with new HTML code, the bindings (ex mousedown) does not bind to those classes?
[18:19:05] <louism2__> Hey guys, I am in the Chrome console and inspecting on object and trying to call what I think is an attribute.  How would I call "responeText" on this object?  Is "responseText" even an attribute like I think it is?  http://imgur.com/zhrpgIh
[18:20:25] <shoky> louism2__: it's a property of the jqXHR object. you don't call it. you can read it
[18:20:49] <louism2__> shoky: thanks for your help.  How would I read that?
[18:21:17] <shoky> louism2__: you don't know how to access an object's fields?
[18:21:59] <louism2__> shoky: I do.  So jqXHR is just an object attribute?
[18:22:12] <Foxhoundz> console.log(jqXHR)
[18:22:19] <shoky> that's what he already did..
[18:22:21] <shoky> louism2__: no
[18:22:47] <shoky> louism2__: if you know how, then that's how you'd do it
[18:22:57] <shoky> if you don't know how, learn javascript
[18:22:58] <shoky> ?learn
[18:22:58] <bot-t1> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[18:25:06] <louism2__> shoky: I appreciate your help but I don't understand why you are on some sort of trip here.  I am asking you for help.  I know enough about javascript to know how to read an objects attributes.  Can you please just fully explain your answer?
[18:25:35] <e563e57> Anybody know how to reapply bindings like I asked above?  The dynamic content I load isnt affected by my bindings
[18:25:43] <shoky> louism2__: how do you read an object's fields?
[18:26:11] <shoky> louism2__: (the things you're calling attributes)
[18:26:49] <shoky> e563e57: you probably want to use event delegation. read about it here: see ?on
[18:26:49] <bot-t1> e563e57, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:27:37] <shoky> louism2__: obj.responseText
[18:28:00] <e563e57> yes, something like $('.refreshButton').on('mousedown', myFunc, true)
[18:28:16] <shoky> e563e57: no, that's not event delegation
[18:28:27] <oojacoboo> do I want to use prop or attr for the name attribute?
[18:28:45] <oojacoboo> do all attributes get set as object properties?
[18:28:48] <e563e57> hum shoky, how would you bind that event for a class ?
[18:29:06] <oojacoboo> am I to assume that you'd only want the attribute when you want the original value within the html
[18:29:10] <shoky> oojacoboo: usually people use attr for that. i think they're interchangable for 'name'
[18:29:22] <oojacoboo> shoky: this whole thing isn't clear enough :/
[18:29:39] <shoky> oojacoboo: generally yes, but there are many default attributes that the browser automatically syncs to the props and vice versa
[18:29:41] <oojacoboo> I mean, I feel like I understand it quite well… just need some better rules for what's what :)
[18:29:50] <oojacoboo> shoky: that's what I figured
[18:29:54] <oojacoboo> like href as well
[18:29:58] <oojacoboo> and src
[18:30:01] <shoky> href is an exception actually
[18:30:17] <shoky> the attr and prop DO get synced, but they dont necessarily have exactly the same value :P
[18:30:29] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea
[18:30:32] <shoky> i dont remember what the diff is
[18:30:52] <oojacoboo> just finding myself thinking about these a bit much
[18:31:18] <shoky> yah it's a pain sometimes
[18:31:20] <oojacoboo> I am glad we're moving past all the jquery foo though
[18:31:43] <oojacoboo> well, refactoring it all is a pain
[18:31:56] <oojacoboo> coding it the first time isn't so bad b/c you know if it works or not
[18:33:01] <e563e57> shoky how about something like $('.refreshButton').on("mousedown", function(event)  { ... ?
[18:33:14] <shoky> e563e57: did you read the part about event delegation?
[18:33:18] <e563e57> yes
[18:33:29] <oojacoboo> e563e57: that's not really delegating the event
[18:33:37] <oojacoboo> that's just registering the handler on that node
[18:33:42] <shoky> e563e57: more like:  $('#staticContainer').on("mousedown", ".refreshButton", function...)
[18:33:43] <louism2__> shoky: trying to access "responseText" returns undefined in the console.  I am using obj.responseText to try to access it
[18:34:07] <shoky> louism2__: donno what you're doing exactly
[18:34:18] <shoky> louism2__: if obj is a jqXHR then obj.responseText should work
[18:35:21] <e563e57> ah, makes sense, thanks a lot shoky!
[18:38:48] <louism2__> shoky: I appreciate your help.  From what I can tell it's jqXHR object but for whatever reason, trying to access responseText using 'obj.responseText' isn't working.  About to go to a meet up so I should be able to get it figured out there.
[18:39:31] <raj> shoky, wutup my nizzle

[19:08:39] <blib> I've a page on which there is a <a ...>Fixed Text</a> - which is written by CORS JS call. Howcan I replace this text and the link using jquery?
[19:11:22] <chadedge> hey kids, I've got a function that uses $.grep() to see if a value matches in some json… but my key is hardcoded (n.key == val). I'd like to have "key" be dynamic (so I can reuse my function), but I'm having a tough time. I thought n.{inputKey} == val would work… nope! ideas?
[19:11:37] <chadedge> if no ideas, what am I trying to do? dynamic key assignment?
[19:11:43] <chadedge> (so I can improve my google searching)
[19:13:26] <cusco> i have no idea what grep() does
[19:13:52] <chadedge> finds based on a filter; just like any grep
[19:14:07] <cusco> and what is  'key' here?
[19:14:26] <e563e57> I have a function which makes 2 async ajax calls, so I call like var result = update(). If i do an alert just before returning data in update it gets correct data but if i alert result i get undefined
[19:14:27] <cusco> so you have two args, the search str, and the where-to-search str
[19:14:41] <chadedge> I have some json: CS.Locations.nearby = [ {"location_id","location_lat"…},{…}]
[19:14:50] <chadedge> so my key for one search is "location_id"
[19:15:10] <chadedge> and I can use my function for that since I do a return from the grep with "return n.location_id == inputLocationID"
[19:15:33] <chadedge> but if I wanted to reuse my function and have "return n.{somethingDifferentAsAKey} == someInputVal" then I'm hosed
[19:16:12] <cusco> I'm going to read on grep()
[19:16:15] <chadedge> I'm trying to lookup my own answer, but the "n.{foopants}" is tripping me up. I know it's not the right code, but I don't know what to call what I'm doing (dynamic key?)
[19:16:43] <Rodrigo_Debian> which the requirement to run jquery in browser? ps: it opens up der 2 click over though not as localhost / indexjquery.html
[19:17:03] <e563e57> any ideas of my question above?
[19:18:09] <chadedge> wondering if I really have to add a stinky $.map to this function
[19:20:08] <cusco> chadedge: why don't you create a js function that takes the parameters, and pass them on to grep(function(var)) ..
[19:22:08] <cusco> thus making it dynamic?
[19:23:03] <blib> If I run replacewith() on a page from the console it works. But when I do it from the last line of my body it does not replace. Any ideas on how to fix this?
[19:24:21] <chadedge> cusco > I did just that. here's my Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/u4sWJ/
[19:24:59] <cusco> chadedge: does it work?
[19:25:30] <chadedge> cusco > only the first attempt. when I have "n.location_id == inputValue" it does, but not if I want to change what the key is (2nd function)
[19:25:38] <blib> is there a way to wait for an element to be available?
[19:25:41] <chadedge> and I need to be able to search the list using ANY key, not hard-code.
[19:32:59] <chadedge> http://jsfiddle.net/u4sWJ/4/ I updated it cusco
[19:34:51] <chadedge> wish I knew the term for what I'm asking for
[19:36:38] <oojacoboo> chadedge: any key?
[19:36:47] <oojacoboo> doesn't js already have a key map
[19:37:12] <chadedge> oojacoboo > well, most usage will only have two keys, so the "cheap" way will be to write nearly identical functions (I've already spent an hour looking for a solution).
[19:37:50] <chadedge> oojacoboo > yeah, but I'm lost in all the searching and reading on "map." I'm lost on how to extend my function to allow me to programatically use a variable as a key name at runtime
[19:37:58] <oojacoboo> chadedge: why not just setup an event for keyup and listen for your key and use a switch statement?
[19:38:18] <chadedge> oojacoboo "Key" in this sense is an array "Key" (not keyboard)
[19:38:26] <oojacoboo> haha :)
[19:38:26] <chadedge> such as "Key Value pairs"
[19:39:20] <oojacoboo> chadedge: have you played with underscore?
[19:39:23] <chadedge> Oh for christ's sake! "obj.key" is synonymous with "obj[key]" !! I can't believe I spent so much time on this!
[19:39:33] <chadedge> oojacoboo > not much, but it would probably be nice to add in at this point.
[19:39:44] <oojacoboo> chadedge: it's amazing for this kind of thing
[19:39:51] <chadedge> oojacoboo > but switching to n[key] instead of n.key works for me
[19:46:40] <chadedge> OK. time to jet. thanks for the help, kids.
[19:47:13] <oojacoboo> azazel91: don't PM people without asking first
[19:47:23] <oojacoboo> also, ask your question here so others can help
[19:48:24] <azazel91> i did
[19:48:46] <azazel91> pm is the easier way
[19:49:46] <azazel91> oojacoboo do you mind if i could pm you
[19:49:51] <oojacoboo> azazel91: I do
[19:49:56] <oojacoboo> you can ask here
[19:50:33] <azazel91> i dont wanna reiteracte what i want
[19:50:57] <azazel91> reiterate
[19:51:48] <azazel91> just scroll up
[19:52:18] <oojacoboo> add the focus for the autocomplete?
[19:52:21] <oojacoboo> what kind of question is that
[19:52:28] <oojacoboo> .testcae
[19:52:31] <oojacoboo> .testcase
[19:52:31] <b-ot> oojacoboo: see: minimal
[19:52:37] <oojacoboo> .minimal
[19:52:37] <b-ot> oojacoboo: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[19:52:46] <oojacoboo> azazel91: ^^ do that

[20:05:31] <TimTim`> hmm
[20:07:17] <TimTim`> how do you get jquery to clone the data of child elements
[20:07:22] <TimTim`> (easily)
[20:08:07] <TimTim`> because it doesn't seem to be working according to the specs
[20:08:15] <TimTim`> deepWithDataAndEvents (default: value of withDataAndEvents)
[20:08:15] <TimTim`> Type: Boolean
[20:08:15] <TimTim`> A Boolean indicating whether event handlers and data for all children of the cloned element should be copied. By default its value matches the first argument's value (which defaults to false).
[20:10:38] <TimTim`> see here: http://jsfiddle.net/CSV8Q/
[20:16:03] <Guest23436> I'm using jquery.hotkeys (https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys(), but I can't get it working for the keys I want.
[20:16:17] <Guest23436> $(document).bind('keydown', 'left', function(e) { works, but ctrl+p for instance doesn't.
[20:16:21] <Guest23436> What's wrong with that?
[20:16:34] <Guest23436> I tried alt+p and ctrl+c and some other stuff.
[20:17:09] <kba> Any idea why?
[20:18:00] <kba> The example in the README on GitHub uses ctrl+a. That doesn't work either.
[20:20:03] <TimTim`> ok wow nvm about my question... the docs seem backwards to me o_O
[20:20:11] <TimTim`> but at least it works now lol
[20:24:16] <TimTim`> errr just kidding still not working as expected
[20:24:18] <TimTim`> damn
[20:24:45] <TimTim`> guess i'll have to clone the child data myself >:|
[20:32:29] <dcherman> TimTim`: what do you mean it's not working?  it looks like the `wtf` property exists on your cloned element's data in that fiddle.
[20:37:41] <TimTim`> dcherman i meant i didn't work as i expected (or wanted)
[20:38:15] <TimTim`> i needed it to truly clone the wtf property's data as well
[20:38:56] <TimTim`> so that modifying the wtf array in "a" doesn't affect the wtf array in "b"
[20:40:24] <dcherman> TimTim`: ah, yep, it won't do that - says that right in the docs, along with an example of how to deep clone data below it.
[20:43:21] <blib> how hard is it to migrate a 1.xx project to 2.0x
[20:44:28] <realazthat> hi
[20:44:40] <realazthat> I'm looking to make some IDE-like environment
[20:44:50] <realazthat> any suggestions on a js lib for this?

[21:04:46] <s2013> i am using a load function to load a form on click but i want it to fade in
[21:04:55] <s2013> how would i do that?
[21:05:16] <s2013> i tried $("#form").fadeIn.load(" form.html #sign_form");
[21:05:42] <oojacoboo> s2013: you'll want to use the fadeIn as part of the .html() method
[21:06:13] <oojacoboo> get the data from the ajax query and use .html() with the fadeIn
[21:06:58] <s2013> ok let me check. im a bit rusty on jquery
[21:08:32] <s2013> it would be type: "GET" right?
[21:09:39] <oojacoboo> that'll work
[21:10:01] <s2013> im a bit confused though. i only want to get content of a specific div
[21:10:04] <s2013> how do i do that?
[21:11:17] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:12:31] <s2013> yeah im looking into it
[21:13:08] <s2013> but i cant find out where the id is
[21:13:51] <s2013> is it data: id: "idname" ?
[21:15:45] <JCadle> oojacoboo, You're not going to be able to use load like that.
[21:15:52] <JCadle> err
[21:15:55] <JCadle> s2013 i mean
[21:16:16] <s2013> well im trying to do the ajax
[21:16:43] <JCadle> You can't load specific selectors in any ajax() methods
[21:16:53] <s2013> i see
[21:16:56] <s2013> so i should stick to load?
[21:17:00] <s2013> i just want it to fade in
[21:17:41] <JCadle> If you're trying to load templates, you should probably put each "form" in its own html
[21:18:04] <s2013> not templates basically there are 2 types of user sign in
[21:18:09] <JCadle> That will ensure you're not loading more data than neccessary
[21:18:11] <s2013> what i wanted to was create tabs
[21:18:24] <s2013> so when you click on a different type of user, that form loads
[21:18:25] <s2013> for now it works fine
[21:18:26] <JCadle> Alternatively you can use a templating system like Hogan
[21:18:33] <JCadle> that can handle if statements
[21:18:38] <JCadle> Any mustache templating
[21:18:50] <JCadle> https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[21:19:42] <s2013> blah its ok. ill just stick to this for now. dont want to complicate things more than it is. im using rails and im still somewhat confused about how rails work with jquery
[21:20:13] <JCadle> The biggest thing is not loading HTML you wont even use, thats just a waste of data being transfered
[21:20:28] <s2013> yeah
[21:31:09] <s2013> whats the best way to toggle between clicks? apparently toggle was deprecated?
[21:31:41] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/c2e719c7a91a97ec4e19
[21:31:43] <s2013> this is what i have
[21:32:01] <s2013> and it works fine. basically what i want to do is when people click again i want it to load back the previous sign in page
[21:36:31] <b0nes> hi guys need a help in this fiddle
[21:36:48] <b0nes> http://jsfiddle.net/jbEQb/3/
[21:36:55] <b0nes> is it possible to add objects with similar name ? Like FOOD ? but with different content/data?
[21:37:07] <b0nes> if someones willing to help :)
[21:37:11] <b0nes> TIA
[21:37:46] <tw2113> my guess is probably not in the same namespace
[21:38:14] <tw2113> <item1><food></food></item><item2><food></food></item2> would be fine
[21:38:33] <tw2113> not sure if namespace is the right term
[21:39:34] <tw2113> i could be all wrong as well
[21:39:40] <b0nes> yeah its hard yeah .. the output should be like the one in the bottom of the fiddle
[22:05:29] <aspect> I'm writing a little function to go to #anchors within a page that may be in a tab
[22:05:54] <aspect> the first part - finding an enclosing tab (if it exists) and opening it is easy
[22:06:43] <aspect> but I'm not clear how to zoom to the appropriate anchor ... is setting window.location.hash sufficient in all cases?

[22:34:57] <sammichToo> for the longest time, I was using parents('<tag>:first')

[23:11:07] <thujone> winjs?
[23:12:36] <diggum> The javascript-based native app projects in Visual Studio.2012.  The most recent jQuery versions SHOULD work, but this seems to be broken.
[23:13:37] <diggum> I didn't want to rewrite my click handler if I didn't need to, but it doesn't sound like this is a common issue or that many people are running into this yet.
[23:14:38] <titii> Hi, how incerement works? This seems to be not working $('#top-menu').css('padding-right', '+57');
[23:19:25] <tw2113> titii, i wouldn't call that incrementing
[23:19:37] <tw2113> i'd call that not succeeding at adding an extra 57px to your padding
[23:19:57] <tw2113> or actually, settting the padding to 57
[23:20:00] <tw2113> not adding to it
[23:21:39] <titii> i cant understand what is about
[23:22:07] <tw2113> what are you trying to do? add 57px to what's already set for the padding?
[23:22:51] <luvmyh0nda> $('#top-menu').css('padding-right', $('#top-menu').css('padding-right')+57);
[23:23:08] <titii> i need to add ... yes, like luvmyh0nda says
[23:23:19] <tw2113> he just gave a solution
[23:23:41] <titii> but i thought there is origniliest solution
[23:25:12] <titii> and what means += ?
[23:25:21] <luvmyh0nda> well, if you want to use that...
[23:25:47] <titii> like .css( "padding-left", "+=15" ) ?
[23:25:57] <luvmyh0nda> oldPadding =  $('#top-menu').css('padding-right'); newPadding += 57; $('#top-menu').css('padding-right',newPadding);
[23:26:10] <luvmyh0nda> er
[23:26:12] <luvmyh0nda> not even
[23:26:18] <luvmyh0nda> oldPadding += 57
[23:26:26] <luvmyh0nda> $('#top-menu').css('padding-right',oldPadding);
[23:26:58] <tw2113> so to sumarize
[23:27:01] <tw2113> oldPadding =  $('#top-menu').css('padding-right');
[23:27:09] <tw2113> oldPadding += 57
[23:27:15] <tw2113> $('#top-menu').css('padding-right',oldPadding);
[23:27:24] <tw2113> with proper semicolons in place
[23:27:57] <titii> ok, but i mean, what is this??? this is from the manual .css( "padding-left", "+=15" )
[23:28:52] <luvmyh0nda> jquery version?
[23:29:05] <titii> ofcourse
[23:29:11] <titii> we talking about jquery
[23:29:26] <titii> ah my version?
[23:29:28] <gry> what is your jquery version?
[23:29:29] <luvmyh0nda> which version
[23:29:30] <gry> yes, of course
[23:29:33] <luvmyh0nda> yes
[23:30:24] <titii> 1.9.1
[23:30:32] <luvmyh0nda> and does : $('#top-menu').css('width', function(index) { return index + 57; }); work?
[23:32:44] <titii> luvmyh0nda: no
[23:32:56] <titii> why? what is going on? its strange
[23:33:00] <luvmyh0nda> are there any errors in console?
[23:33:13] <luvmyh0nda> and does changing $ to jQuery work?
[23:33:26] <luvmyh0nda> so: jQuery('#top-menu').css('width', function(index) { return index + 57; });
[23:33:28] <titii> no errors
[23:34:14] <luvmyh0nda> 1sec
[23:34:28] <s2013> are bind, live, delegate not used anymore?
[23:34:40] <titii> luvmyh0nda: changing, no. the same result
[23:36:36] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/FRMgr/
[23:36:52] <luvmyh0nda> we can see that the functionality works, try changing the margin-left, and notice that the element moves
[23:38:05] <titii> luvmyh0nda: yes, i changed it to 120, and it moves
[23:39:17] <luvmyh0nda> are you able to alert(jQuery('#top-menu').css('padding-left'));
[23:41:02] <sammichToo> jQuery Mobile Q again: I've got a button that changes the page with href=#pageid. I've got 3 pages atm (call them 1, 2, 3 in order on the dom). Button on page 1 goes to page 2. Button on page 2 goes to page 1.
[23:41:10] <titii> luvmyh0nda: yes, padding right, its 171px
[23:41:42] <sammichToo> Page 1 -> 2 is fine. Page 2 -> 1 takes a detour through page 3
[23:41:57] <luvmyh0nda> titii: & is it floated to the right?
[23:42:49] <titii> luvmyh0nda: no, that element has not float
[23:43:26] <titii> but is was alert this alert(jQuery('#top-menu').css('padding-right')+57); result = 171px57 :) its bad
[23:43:44] <luvmyh0nda> try floating it to the right
[23:43:45] <titii> i was alert
[23:43:53] <Abishek> can I perform a HTTP PUT using Jquery? is there a $.put() ?
[23:44:45] <luvmyh0nda> Abishek: $.ajax({type:'put'});
[23:44:51] <luvmyh0nda> not supported by all browsers ;)
[23:45:09] <titii> luvmyh0nda: why right?
[23:46:06] <luvmyh0nda> titii: padding-right won't work if it's oriented to the left, unless there's something to the right of it
[23:47:34] <luvmyh0nda> you can see it working: http://jsfiddle.net/FRMgr/1/
[23:48:01] <titii> luvmyh0nda: but i have at the right another object  for that i creating place, but i can see the padding result in the firebud console
[23:48:01] <luvmyh0nda> but you will see no actual display change takes place
[23:48:17] <luvmyh0nda> try using margin-left
[23:48:24] <luvmyh0nda> sorry, margin-right
[23:54:46] <titii> luvmyh0nda: omg, sorry, my wrongs, it works good, but my wrong :)
[23:55:04] <luvmyh0nda> lol what happened?
[23:55:21] <titii> luvmyh0nda: that incrementing, but i was expect something else, but my wrong counting :D
[23:55:34] <titii> :)
[23:55:44] <luvmyh0nda> good to hear!
[23:55:51] <titii> luvmyh0nda: thank u very much :) sorry
