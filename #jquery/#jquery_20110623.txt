[00:00:37] <coldhead> hi jakob124
[00:00:52] <jakob124> can any one say how to get say 3rd child using .children()?
[00:01:23] <coldhead> ?children
[00:01:23] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[00:01:47] <coldhead> .children(':nth(3)')
[00:01:52] <coldhead> ?nth
[00:01:53] <bot-t> coldhead, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[00:01:53] <Cluber> btw, "var $this = $(this); // Saves a reference to the button" what exactly was this for?
[00:02:01] <coldhead> er see ?eq
[00:02:01] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[00:02:09] <coldhead> >>>: |
[00:02:26] <coldhead> Cluber: if you don't need it, forget about it
[00:02:29] <jakob124> tahnks
[00:02:38] <Cluber> ok, works fine without.
[00:02:57] <coldhead> .children(':nth-child(3)')

[00:29:28] <jquery_lover> Good Morning from Spain!
[00:29:37] <jquery_lover> anyone can help me?
[00:29:54] <gnarf> ?ask
[00:29:54] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:32:39] <jquery_lover> oks! sorry, i¬¥m new. I have a carousel in 1 web. www.proyectos.temeld4.com/lasvegas/ The first time don¬¥t run the plugin correctly, but when I refresh the webpage is running good. This happens in a few webs and i can¬¥t find the "problem"
[00:39:51] <jquery_lover> Sorry this is the direct link http://www.proyectos.temeld4.com/lasvegas/presentacion/index.html . I don¬¥t know how I can do
[00:43:31] <coldhead> it works for me, jquery_lover
[00:44:41] <jquery_lover> and for me, but the first time don¬¥t run fine, In firefox is running but in the bottom are something wrong, in IE7 is loading only 1 image, when I refresh the web, all works fine
[00:45:02] <coldhead> for me in chrome it runs fine the first time
[00:45:15] <coldhead> you might want to try another carousel plugin
[00:45:20] <coldhead> i have never heard of this one
[00:46:16] <jquery_lover> This is not the first time happens this and with other plugins are the same, i think i¬¥m doing something wrong
[00:46:33] <jquery_lover> This is not the first time happens this and with other plugins are the same, i think i¬¥m doing something wrong coldhead
[00:47:47] <coldhead> not that i can see, sorry :(
[00:49:09] <jquery_lover> coldhead ! don¬¥t worry! A lot of thanks for your attention!
[00:52:52] <VictorCL2> hi :)
[00:53:33] <coldhead> hi VictorCL2
[00:53:43] <VictorCL2> how would you optimize this , this goes on a loop , works fine on firefox, chrome , opera , but on ie8 is pretty slow :(  ===  $tableScope.find("tr").eq(i).children().eq(a).find("div").eq(0).html();
[00:55:11] <VictorCL2> I have to sacan 10 <tr> with 21 <td> .. and see if any of those <td> has a div with a class="event" on it
[00:56:36] <coldhead> can't you just select the event divs directly? $('.event') ?
[00:56:59] <coldhead> ?perf
[00:57:00] <bot-t> http://www.artzstudio.com/2009/04/jquery-performance-rules/ , http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance/ , Advanced: http://jonraasch.com/blog/10-advanced-jquery-performance-tuning-tips-from-paul-irish , Presentation [Flash]: http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[00:57:08] <coldhead> look at some of those for tips
[00:57:37] <VictorCL2> I have to get the div.event that are on a range of <td>
[00:58:03] <VictorCL2> I have 100 <td> .. then I need to look for this div.event on  <td> 30 til 56 for example
[00:58:07] <coldhead> how you optimise it depends on your html and on what a and i are
[00:58:17] <VictorCL2> and scan each row
[00:58:21] <coldhead> but you are right, having two finds and two eqs is slow
[00:59:20] <VictorCL2> it just slow on ie8
[00:59:38] <VictorCL2> ie9 must work better I guess, but I dont have it
[00:59:55] <coldhead> you should be able to optimise it more
[01:00:02] <coldhead> can you paste a working demo on jsfiddle?
[01:00:12] <VictorCL2> I will try
[01:02:15] <Ahrengot> Is there a way to get custom jQuery UI off Google's CDN? ‚Äì I'm relly just looking for the easing part :)
[01:04:04] <Graloth> I have a small problem, i'm loading contents from a plain .txt file and then using replace('/n','<br>') to make sure it has proper linebreaks, but it only does it for the first occurance
[01:04:10] <VictorCL2> wait
[01:04:17] <coldhead> Ahrengot: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[01:04:31] <coldhead> ?p @ Graloth
[01:04:31] <bot-t> Graloth, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:04:44] <coldhead> you can't just use <pre>, Graloth ?
[01:05:25] <Ahrengot> coldhead, thanks but i already had that link. Just looking for the easing part like to get get on jQuery UI's website.
[01:05:42] <VictorCL2> ok look
[01:05:42] <VictorCL2> http://jsfiddle.net/HPPq7/
[01:05:50] <Graloth> bot-t: how do i make that load the textfile? as far as i can see it wont allow me to upload files
[01:05:52] <bot-t> Graloth, PHP & jQuery image upload and crop | WebMotionUK - http://www.webmotionuk.co.uk/php-jquery-image-upload-and-crop/
[01:05:55] <coldhead> oh i missed the word custom, sorry Ahrengot
[01:06:21] <coldhead> Graloth: bot-t wants to see the code you are using which you say doesn't work
[01:06:51] <coldhead> Ahrengot: you suck
[01:07:28] <Graloth> coldhead: it does work, but only for the first line in the textfile, the rest are all on the same line, the newlines didn't get replaced
[01:07:37] <Graloth> http://jsfiddle.net/HWvKY/
[01:07:47] <Graloth> you can't test it, since it cant load the file from there
[01:08:08] <coldhead> just seeing th code should help, thx Graloth
[01:08:18] <coldhead> VictorCL2: http://jsfiddle.net/HPPq7/1/
[01:08:28] <coldhead> cache the .eq(i) bit
[01:08:55] <Graloth> i would preferr putting each value from the textfile into an array, but havent found out how
[01:10:06] <coldhead> ?mdc replace
[01:10:07] <bot-t> coldhead, replace - MDC Docs - Returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement .  The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for e... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[01:10:27] <coldhead> thx bot-t
[01:10:27] * bot-t sighs
[01:10:48] <JKarsrud> Graloth: split('\n') ?
[01:10:54] <JKarsrud> or something?
[01:11:27] <coldhead> Graloth: $("#loginform").html(data.replace(/\n/g,'<br>'));
[01:11:46] <coldhead> /n/ is a regex and g means to replace globally, not just the first occurence
[01:12:30] <Graloth> that worked, thanks
[01:12:31] <Graloth> !!
[01:12:40] <coldhead> yay
[01:12:43] <coldhead> !!
[01:12:48] <JKarsrud> !!
[01:12:51] <dytrivedi> !!
[01:13:29] <Graloth> would that also work with split()?
[01:13:36] <JKarsrud> ?mdc split
[01:13:37] <bot-t> JKarsrud, split - MDC Docs - Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[01:13:48] <Graloth> so i could get it to an array instead
[01:13:57] <JKarsrud> just try it :)
[01:14:16] <coldhead> looks like you can split on a regexp
[01:14:19] <JKarsrud> should work
[01:14:20] <JKarsrud> yup
[01:14:34] <JKarsrud> seems like it does it globally too
[01:15:00] <JKarsrud> so var string = file.split(/(\n)/) maybe
[01:15:10] <JKarsrud> If I'm reading the docs right
[01:15:43] <JKarsrud> what's up with MDC today anyway?
[01:15:49] <JKarsrud> header is totally eff'd
[01:16:05] <aaronmcadam> really? what browser
[01:16:05] <dytrivedi> yeah
[01:16:13] <dytrivedi> and it's like, they don't care?
[01:16:25] <aaronmcadam> looks fine to me
[01:16:30] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: chrome 12.0.742.100
[01:16:32] <dytrivedi> try chroam
[01:16:50] <aaronmcadam> i'm on 12.0.742.100
[01:16:51] <JKarsrud> I haz proof!
[01:16:51] <JKarsrud> http://gyazo.com/36fd4155311e6278f75022c94db4ab92.png
[01:16:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:17:12] <aaronmcadam> looks fine to me
[01:17:15] <aaronmcadam> I'm on ubuntu
[01:17:21] <JKarsrud> oh, I'm on a boat
[01:17:26] <JKarsrud> that could be the problem
[01:17:27] <coldhead> i doubt mozilla gives a shit how it renders in chrome
[01:17:33] <aaronmcadam> that can't be true
[01:17:47] <JKarsrud> ahh, they fixed it now :)
[01:17:48] <aaronmcadam> maybe it's mac only
[01:17:56] <JKarsrud> Nope, it's fine now
[01:18:16] <coldhead> maybe you had some gunk in your eye, JKarsrud
[01:18:21] <JKarsrud> maybe
[01:18:22] <osmosis_paul> Good morning, somebody know why i Chrome and Safari this sentence dont response me the value "$(e.target).val()" but yes in firefox
[01:18:42] <JKarsrud> or maybe I just hit it while they updated some CSS
[01:18:55] <JKarsrud> or something
[01:19:03] <aaronmcadam> could be looks like they've tweaked the design again
[01:19:14] <JKarsrud> probably
[01:19:28] <aaronmcadam> might have been caching
[01:19:48] <skunkApe> can anyone out ther help me lean complex jquery procedure to build table using ajax and json? I can build my columns but i'm having poblems adding data cells.
[01:20:16] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: I tried hard refreshing four times, just to see if that was an issue, but it works now, so
[01:20:26] <dytrivedi> osmosis_paul: wouldn't it be good to use $(this).val(), if I am not wrong?
[01:20:35] <Graloth> http://jsfiddle.net/HWvKY/1/
[01:20:40] <Graloth> now nothing happens at all
[01:20:41] <JKarsrud> they probably had to deploy the CSS to multiple load balanced servers, without taking them down
[01:21:01] <dytrivedi> and I should be right back
[01:21:03] <dytrivedi> .
[01:21:06] <osmosis_paul> dytrivedi, sorry but i dont know what do you mean
[01:21:17] <aaronmcadam> just use this osmosis_paul
[01:21:30] <dytrivedi> this as in 'this'
[01:21:35] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:21:39] <dytrivedi> :)
[01:21:39] <aaronmcadam> do you not know what this is?
[01:21:50] <coldhead> ?inArray @ Graloth
[01:21:50] <bot-t> Graloth, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[01:21:54] <dytrivedi> I know what is this
[01:21:58] <coldhead> you need $.inArray
[01:21:59] <dytrivedi> as in 'this'
[01:22:06] <aaronmcadam> I'm talkin to osmosis_paul sorry dude
[01:22:06] <osmosis_paul> yeah i was thinking that you gonna type something else as "this" jejeje
[01:22:23] <dytrivedi> coldhead: YOU GRADUATED TO SECOND DAY
[01:22:27] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: inside the event handler, do $(this).val(), seeing as $(this) is the element that triggered the event :)
[01:22:38] <coldhead> i don't think i did, dytrivedi
[01:22:43] <coldhead> i don't remember yesterday
[01:22:51] <dytrivedi> ohhhh
[01:23:08] <dytrivedi> that's like, bhanged
[01:23:10] <nVee> Hey, when inserting code with a button using .html("<button class="name">button</a>"), it fails to pick up the class in the button for usage in another function? Can someone perhaps explain to me why?
[01:23:17] <nVee> I am very new in jquery :)
[01:23:23] <coldhead> me too nVee
[01:23:24] <dytrivedi> where you don't remember things before  a moment
[01:23:27] <osmosis_paul> with this the same issue
[01:23:27] <aaronmcadam> hhaa
[01:23:28] <osmosis_paul> $(this).val();
[01:23:44] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: show some coadz plz
[01:23:47] <osmosis_paul> in chrome dont give the value but yes in firefox
[01:23:48] <dytrivedi> yeah
[01:23:50] <aaronmcadam> nVee why don't you try the JavaScript jQuery plugin, it's awesome :D
[01:23:52] <dytrivedi> coads are required
[01:23:59] <coldhead> nVee: is name a variable?
[01:23:59] <osmosis_paul> "var languageId = $(this).val();"
[01:24:00] <dytrivedi> haha
[01:24:10] <dytrivedi> without quotes?
[01:24:17] <dytrivedi> I presume
[01:24:26] <osmosis_paul> with your changes
[01:24:30] <osmosis_paul> abnd as i had var languageId = $(e.target).val();
[01:24:34] <coldhead> maybe you want ...class="' + name + '">etc
[01:24:42] <Graloth> coldhead: thanks, now it atleast does something, but now it returns the "YES" text even thou something that is definately not in the array, is there
[01:25:08] <Graloth> http://jsfiddle.net/HWvKY/2/
[01:25:21] <osmosis_paul> yeah of course no quotes
[01:25:26] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: we need to see some more code
[01:25:28] <osmosis_paul> i'm saying that in firefox works
[01:25:38] <JKarsrud> like your whole function, in a fiddle or on pastebin
[01:25:39] <JKarsrud> :)
[01:25:41] <JKarsrud> ?paste
[01:25:42] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:26:08] <coldhead> Graloth: http://jsfiddle.net/HWvKY/3/
[01:26:22] <coldhead> try something like that with firebug open so you can see what the val() actually is
[01:27:26] <osmosis_paul> JKarsrud, here code
[01:27:26] <osmosis_paul> http://pastecode.org/index.php/view/75444657
[01:27:45] <osmosis_paul> one more time guys remind you, with firefox works, must be a chrome issue
[01:28:04] <osmosis_paul> i was looking in stackoverflow but nothing
[01:29:06] <Graloth> coldhead: it contains all the values from the textfile as an array
[01:29:19] <coldhead> that's what data contains, but what about the other thing
[01:29:28] <coldhead> $(namefield).val()
[01:29:36] <Graloth> oh right
[01:29:38] <coldhead> because if that's '' or undefined it might be in the array
[01:30:02] <Graloth> it contains what i typed, since its a tool name search thingy i'm working on
[01:30:06] <coldhead> you can also test with $.inArray('something totally not in the array like love maybe', data)
[01:30:17] <Graloth> ok
[01:30:18] <osmosis_paul> dytrivedi, did you see the whole function that i pasted?
[01:30:50] <osmosis_paul> JKarsrud, any idea or suggestion?
[01:31:21] <nVee> Anyways, this will explain a little better. When using the .html() function in jquery, to output other items which has linked function calls, those calls do not appear to work. http://jsfiddle.net/9JtBt/
[01:31:28] <Graloth> coldhead: using the test you suggested, it still returns the "YES" text, and that is definately not in the array
[01:31:30] <nVee> I just want to understand why not
[01:31:41] <coldhead> stupid inArray!
[01:32:01] <coldhead> oh! inArray returns -1 for failure
[01:32:06] <coldhead> and look, that's true
[01:32:18] <coldhead> ?eval if ( -1 ) "true!
[01:32:19] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[01:32:24] <coldhead> ?eval if ( -1 ) "true!"l
[01:32:24] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[01:32:27] <coldhead> ?eval if ( -1 ) "true!";
[01:32:28] <bot-t> coldhead: "true!"
[01:32:31] <coldhead> >: |
[01:32:46] <coldhead> you want if ($.inArray(etc) > -1)
[01:32:57] <Graloth> ok
[01:33:07] <coldhead> tricky!
[01:33:45] <Graloth> now it returns "No" even for something that is in the array
[01:33:51] <Graloth> oph wait
[01:33:58] <Graloth> forgot to revert the test text >.<
[01:34:02] <coldhead> lol
[01:34:03] <slartsa> this is a newbie asking: why am I not able to move or resize window created? http://tyoton.com/tyoton/pdffi/jquery-test.htm
[01:34:31] <Graloth> YAY!
[01:34:35] <Graloth> thanks coldhead
[01:34:43] <coldhead> a pleasure!
[01:41:42] <osmosis_paul> Somebody here that use chrome can tell me how they get the value of that button????
[01:41:59] <osmosis_paul> with "$(this).attr("value");" does not work
[01:42:03] <jrockjiggz> val()
[01:42:22] <coldhead> http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1994-09-09/
[01:43:11] <nVee> Anyways, this will explain a little better. When using the .html() function in jquery, to output other items which has linked function calls, those calls do not appear to work. http://jsfiddle.net/9JtBt/
[01:44:24] <osmosis_paul> i try all the options "$(this).val();"  "$(e.target).val();"
[01:44:26] <osmosis_paul> but nothing
[01:44:29] <osmosis_paul> always blank
[01:44:37] <osmosis_paul> and with firefox response correctly
[01:44:56] <Tobsn> what timezone is GMT?
[01:44:59] <Tobsn> -000 ?
[01:45:01] <Puck`> 0
[01:45:05] <Tobsn> thx
[01:45:13] <Puck`> yw
[01:45:16] <Tobsn> toUTCString() returns only GMT
[01:45:26] <osmosis_paul> "$(this).attr("val") and "$(this).attr("value") and nothing as well. run out of ideas
[01:45:46] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: hmm, well, are you sure e is passed in to that function?
[01:45:52] <JKarsrud> console.log(e) inside your function?
[01:45:56] <JKarsrud> or alert(e)
[01:46:07] <osmosis_paul> JKarsrud, so sure that in  firefox works perfectly :-)
[01:46:19] <osmosis_paul> yeah the alert of e is HTMLElement
[01:46:36] <JKarsrud> well, does HTMLElement have target?
[01:46:54] <osmosis_paul> e.target is the HTMLElement
[01:47:00] <JKarsrud> ah
[01:47:01] <JKarsrud> ok
[01:47:33] <JKarsrud> And you get that in the other browsers as well?=
[01:47:58] <osmosis_paul> i'm not so hardcore programer in JQuery, if is a bug of the version  of something i dont have any clue
[01:48:07] <osmosis_paul> i try in firefox and works
[01:48:35] <coldhead> can you paste the code you are using, osmosis_paul ?
[01:48:39] <JKarsrud> yes, but see if e.target it HTMLElement in other browsers too
[01:48:46] <coldhead> people use event.target without trouble all the time
[01:48:58] <JKarsrud> coldhead: http://pastecode.org/index.php/view/75444657

[01:50:33] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: it's a bot, he won't respond
[01:51:22] * dytrivedi hugs bot-t
[01:51:22] * bot-t hugs dytrivedi back
[01:51:25] <coldhead> bot-t: will you respond?
[01:51:25] <bot-t> coldhead, It is decidedly so.
[01:51:30] <coldhead> he feels love!
[01:51:33] <JKarsrud> :D
[01:51:34] <dytrivedi> bot-t: I love you
[01:51:34] <coldhead> more than i do!
[01:51:34] <bot-t> no you don't
[01:51:36] * gnarf slaps bot-t
[01:51:36] * bot-t dodges gnarf's attack and slaps back!
[01:51:40] * gnarf falls over
[01:51:52] * coldhead rushes to gnarf's aid
[01:51:52] <VictorCL2> ok so I updated from jquery 1.5.2 to 1.6.1 ... and somethings stop working ¬¨¬¨
[01:52:04] <dytrivedi> aids? did you say aids?
[01:52:09] <dytrivedi> aww aid
[01:52:14] <gnarf> VictorCL2: look for uses of .attr() that should instead use ?prop

[01:52:31] <gnarf> VictorCL2: are you using jQuery UI?

[01:52:46] <VictorCL2> yeah the attr("checked") .. stoped working
[01:52:58] <osmosis_paul> nobody use here chrome?, should be something very commond have an issue when you try to get the value of a button
[01:53:26] <coldhead> oh god more attr() problems with 1.6.1
[01:53:34] <Tobsn> im adding data to the DOM over jquery template and i want to apply other stuff to elements within that data... it kinda looks like i cant access the new data. is there anyway to get them with live() ?
[01:53:36] <coldhead> gnarf! halp! halllp!
[01:54:34] <JKarsrud> osmosis_paul: it's not
[01:54:43] <JKarsrud> but is it a button?
[01:54:48] <JKarsrud> as in <button>
[01:54:52] <JKarsrud> or is it an input?
[01:54:53] <dytrivedi> Tobsn: and then I pulled up my underwear and jumped from the terrace.
[01:55:02] <osmosis_paul> JKarsrud, is a button
[01:55:05] <Tobsn> hu? hehe
[01:55:06] <coldhead> VictorCL2: can you use .is(':checked') instead?
[01:55:11] <JKarsrud> then see ?text

[02:18:21] <Zerxer> that's controlling him
[02:18:27] <BlackAnt> Is is possible to usa YQL in an irc bot???
[02:18:33] <BlackAnt> use.
[02:18:36] <gnarf> send it home pls?
[02:18:37] <Zerxer> it*
[02:18:47] <BlackAnt> mine bot
[02:18:47] <gnarf> play with yer bot in yer own channel?
[02:18:56] <Zerxer> this is bot-t's home
[02:19:03] <BlackAnt> I feel lazy typing commands
[02:19:03] <Zerxer> there ain't enough room for the two of them, partner
[02:19:24] <BlackAnt> everybody needs shortcuts sometimes
[02:19:58] <gnarf> BlackAnt: this is not your bot playground
[02:20:07] <BlackAnt> gnarf yep
[02:20:37] <BlackAnt> !shutdown
[02:20:44] <egrouse> my pages get scrolled up to the top whenever i do an animate(); function, is there a way i can prevent this
[02:20:44] <gnarf> thx
[02:21:36] <gnarf> egrouse: browser?
[02:21:40] <gnarf> egrouse: and example?
[02:21:58] <unomi> Hi, assuming that I know that I want the the dom element of the first 'a' within selector, how would I get it?
[02:22:21] <gnarf> $(selector).find("a").first()
[02:22:36] <unomi> trying to get something sane out of jQuery('selector').children('a').get();
[02:22:51] <gnarf> ?find
[02:22:51] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[02:22:52] <gnarf> ?first
[02:22:53] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[02:22:53] <unomi> mhhm, find is a better choice
[02:22:55] <gnarf> ?children
[02:22:55] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[02:23:16] <unomi> awesome, now how do I get the DOM element?
[02:23:33] <gnarf> .get()
[02:23:40] <unomi> and that returns what?
[02:23:41] <gnarf> or just [0] instead of .first()
[02:23:50] <unomi> and what if it is empty?
[02:23:53] <gnarf> .get(0) gets the 0
[02:23:55] <gnarf> or undefined
[02:23:59] <Zerxer> have I ever told you guys I'm having an affair with jquery? that's how much love I have for it. enough to hide it from my girlfriend
[02:23:59] <unomi> yah
[02:24:43] <timing> Zerxer: this channel is probably logged, so I think you should hide now
[02:25:02] <Zerxer> it's ok she's not pro at googling
[02:25:36] <Zerxer> she still uses firefox and goes to google.com to do a search when I'm like "the search bar is right there already"
[02:25:57] <BlackAnt> I got married to Jquery and Flash. I've divorced flash recenty
[02:26:04] <Zerxer> and I tell her the URL of a site to visit and she goes to google to google the name I gave and click the link from there
[02:26:13] <Zerxer> now why would flash ever be an option like that
[02:26:31] <BlackAnt> cuz flash isnt only for tweening
[02:26:57] <BlackAnt> I've seen flash as a good stuff for working with multiple langauges
[02:27:27] <BlackAnt> to achieve the limit client side
[02:29:24] <unomi> thanks gnarf
[02:29:55] <gnarf> unomi: but [0] is the same as .get(0)
[02:29:57] <gnarf> so like use it
[02:29:58] <gnarf> :)
[02:30:06] <johanhar> WHats it called, to $("#someID") ?  select a element with jquery? Do I need to check if it exist before I call a method on it, or will that be ignored if it does not exist?
[02:30:08] <gnarf> prop access is generally faster than function call
[02:30:22] <gnarf> johanhar: depends on what method
[02:30:29] <gnarf> johanhar: most things work on empty sets
[02:30:32] <gnarf> but somethings are useless
[02:30:42] <gnarf> so like, checking .length is common
[02:30:50] <gnarf> and yes, selecting elements
[02:30:59] <unomi> gnarf, I was expecting that [0] would return a jquery wrapped object, no?
[02:31:04] <johanhar> Ok, so far I just if($("#something")) $("#something").method()
[02:31:11] <gnarf> unomi: no, for that use ?eq
[02:31:11] <bot-t> unomi, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:31:32] <unomi> right, I do want the pure dom el
[02:31:45] <gnarf> oh, no, [0] returns the DOMElement
[02:31:54] <gnarf> the jquery object is basically a decorated array of dom elements
[02:35:25] <unomi> gnarf: .eq returns a single element array
[02:35:29] <E_mE> did the attr() method return undefined in v1.4.2 when the attribute didn't orginally exist in the HTML?
[02:36:37] <E_mE> no answers?
[02:37:21] <unomi> E_mE: no idea, but it sounds reasonable, no?
[02:38:35] <fabiobik> hello
[02:40:08] <dytrivedi> ?tias @ E_mE
[02:40:09] <bot-t> E_mE, Try It And See
[02:40:09] <gnarf> E_mE: see ?tias
[02:40:09] <bot-t> E_mE, Try It And See
[02:40:15] <dytrivedi> :)
[02:40:56] <theTree> hi guys, I'm writing a page that submits ajax requests when checkboxes are clicked. However if the user clicks a number of checkboxes in rapid succession, I need a way of aborting the previous requests (or discarding their ajax server responses) and waiting for the most recent response and using that. I can imagine this is a frequent requirement: is there a best practise for dealing with this?
[02:41:01] <gnarf> E_mE: for some attribtues it might return false
[02:48:00] <Etu> Heya, I need help with a selector in jquery. I guess its dead easy...
[02:48:02] <Etu> http://jsfiddle.net/km2cx/1/
[02:48:19] <Etu> I want to alert only when user types in the last input
[02:48:38] <Etu> last input (in every div)
[02:50:04] <theTree> etu: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/km2cx/2/
[02:50:36] <Etu> theTree: It gives the last input, in the last div. Not last input in every div
[02:51:09] <marktuk> i'm getting '.position() is null' on a position:fixed; element in firefox
[02:51:39] <marktuk> did firefox change the way it works out positions on fixed elements now?
[02:52:55] <theTree> Etu: is it important for you to use live()?
[02:53:03] <jeroenem> Hi... im stuck on some modal window.. check http://jsfiddle.net/hXUaz/ if i click on item 1, only the info of item 1 should appear. Same goes for item 2 - show item 2 info etc.
[02:53:07] <gnarf> marktuk: .css("position") ?
[02:53:11] <Etu> theTree: yes
[02:53:15] <gnarf> oh
[02:53:19] <gnarf> you want the top/left
[02:53:20] <gnarf> sry
[02:53:22] <Etu> theTree: elements will change over time
[02:53:26] <gnarf> is the element shown marktuk?
[02:53:53] <simoncpu> hi. is it possible to add a regex test to the validation plugin?
[02:53:59] <Etu> theTree: http://jsfiddle.net/km2cx/3/ seems to do it :)
[02:53:59] <marktuk> gnarf: yes
[02:54:08] <gnarf> ?p @marktuk
[02:54:08] <bot-t> marktuk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:54:14] <gnarf> try reduced test case?
[02:54:23] <gnarf> minimal css / html / js
[02:54:26] <gnarf> see if you see the same issue
[02:54:40] <theTree> Etu: ah, good good :)
[02:56:00] <marktuk> ffs#
[02:56:09] <marktuk> jsfiddle keeps fucking the line breaks in my code when i paste it
[02:59:44] <AdvoWork> anyone here used jeditable and used some kind of table sorter? i cant get both of these things to work and ive tried loads..
[03:01:10] <fabiobik> TML do you program in other languages
[03:02:20] <fabiobik> im taking an corse of computer programming at school
[03:02:29] <fabiobik> here in Portugal
[03:02:31] <Etu> theTree: cool... that selector doesnt match in my real code... even with the exact same structure...
[03:03:47] <fabiobik> and the language selected for the programming methodology was Pascal ....
[03:04:30] <marktuk> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/JhxKM/10/
[03:04:38] <jeroenem> Any idea how to make this modal window work ? http://jsfiddle.net/hXUaz/
[03:04:47] <marktuk> adjust the result pain so the grey block doesn't it and you have to scroll
[03:05:10] <marktuk> when you scroll, the sidebar becomes fixed and floats, they idea is when it hits the bottom, it locks in to position again
[03:05:45] <datarecall> http://paste2.org/p/1484819 any thoughts on why this colorbox wont reopen, its logging to console just fine i just cant get the colorbox to refire

[03:08:45] <jchillerup> I'm trying to .delegate the ready event, but it doesn't seem to work. Is ready undelegate-able?
[03:12:03] <aaronmcadam> jchillerup, why?
[03:12:43] <aaronmcadam> doesn't seem to make sense
[03:13:15] <jchillerup> Why I want to delegate a ready event?
[03:13:17] <aaronmcadam> what are u trying to do?
[03:13:28] <BlackAnt> GIBSON, WILLIAM (1948-) He is married with two children. In
[03:13:29] <BlackAnt> the early 1980s he wrote Neuromancer, and with this novel he
[03:13:33] <jchillerup> Every time a table gets another TD, I need to change that TD's .data
[03:13:43] <aaronmcadam> uh
[03:13:48] <Etu> theTree: http://jsfiddle.net/km2cx/7/ This is a cool problem. It dosnt work on Box 2, but on Box 1. Becose Box2 has a <br /> in the end.
[03:13:57] <aaronmcadam> yeah so delegate to the table
[03:14:03] <jchillerup> That's what I'm doing
[03:14:13] <jchillerup> $(this).delegate('td', { 'ready': prepareTD,
[03:14:16] <aaronmcadam> the ready event won't help you
[03:14:24] <jchillerup> this in that case is a table
[03:14:41] <aaronmcadam> emm
[03:14:48] <aaronmcadam> does the ready event fire on element creation?
[03:15:06] <jchillerup> Doesn't it fire when an element is loaded and placed in the DOM?
[03:15:19] <aaronmcadam> no it fires when the dom is ready to be manipulated
[03:15:24] <aaronmcadam> not when you create an element
[03:15:28] <aaronmcadam> where did u read that
[03:16:13] <jchillerup> aaronmcadam: I don't remember. Am I wrong?
[03:16:15] <aaronmcadam> ?ready @ jchillerup
[03:16:16] <bot-t> jchillerup, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[03:16:27] <aaronmcadam> yes, completely I'm afraid
[03:16:46] <aaronmcadam> use pubsub or custom events if you want
[03:16:52] <jchillerup> Ah!
[03:17:13] <aaronmcadam> i highly recommend pubsub
[03:17:17] <jchillerup> OK, I see the problem.
[03:17:20] <jchillerup> pubsub.com??

[03:20:27] <CasW> I have a 'moving' site like http://codecanyon.net/item/the-wall-media-gallery-jquery-powered/full_screen_preview/223915, and I also want to use draggable and resizable, but that conflicts a little
[03:21:04] <CasW> The draggable and resizable are resized and dragged relative to mouse.pageX, but the draggable and resizable div moves
[03:21:10] <CasW> Is there any way to solve this?
[03:21:45] <jchillerup> aaronmcadam: It's basically MVC in js
[03:21:51] <aaronmcadam> no
[03:21:53] <aaronmcadam> it's not
[03:22:03] <aaronmcadam> backbone or javascriptMVC is
[03:22:06] <jchillerup> well, you can separate view code and controller code
[03:22:13] <aaronmcadam> *sort of*
[03:22:29] <aaronmcadam> you should try backbone
[03:22:34] <jchillerup> kay
[03:22:39] <jchillerup> I'm pretty new to JS, heh ;)
[03:23:21] <CasW> I have to go, sorry

[03:25:14] <egrouse> gnarf: sorry missed your reply, happens in all browsers
[03:25:44] <egrouse> im using animate() to modify margin left on some images when a link is clicked, but whenever the link is clicked the page scrolls up to the top immediately if the user has already scrolled it down somewhat
[03:27:06] <guy> how do I get a coordinate of the bottom most visible part of the window?
[03:27:08] <guy> (this should change when scrolling down)
[03:34:55] <BlaDe^> how can I insert: <input type="file" id="newUpload" name="upload_file[]" size="1" class="new_file" />  into .add_more ?
[03:35:40] <Zerxer> BlaDe^: $(".add_more").append('the input html you just typed there')
[03:36:00] <Zerxer> but you shouldn't have the id set if you're going to be appending multiple
[03:36:09] <Zerxer> ids should be unique so you should likely unset that first
[03:36:50] <Zerxer> var u = $("#newUpload").clone().attr('id', ''); $(".add_more").append(u)
[03:36:53] <Zerxer> something like that
[03:38:57] <BlaDe^> Zerxer there wont be multiple, it's just if a user empties the table... then there's no input left, there needs to be one :)
[03:42:19] <Northwoods> what is best way to store data on client side in web browser?
[03:42:24] <Northwoods> use javascript arrays ?
[03:43:04] <Jakey> cookies
[03:43:05] <nauthiz> or create an object
[03:43:17] <wang> what sort of data?
[03:43:27] <BlackAnt> I love the way Im feeling
[03:43:37] <dytrivedi> Northwoods: localstorage

[03:44:26] <unomi> Northwoods: depends on how much you are storing and what you want to do with it
[03:44:31] <dytrivedi> yep so you need localstorage, man
[03:44:33] <nauthiz> and what if the client isnt html5-compliant?
[03:44:38] <dytrivedi> there are even fallbacks
[03:44:42] <dytrivedi> nauthiz: there are shims

[03:45:08] <dytrivedi> and btw
[03:45:23] <nauthiz> ah ok :D
[03:45:38] <dytrivedi> Firefox 3.5, Safari 4, IE8, Chrome 4+ support localstorage
[03:46:28] <BlackAnt> safzouf there u are
[03:46:36] <innociv> Jakey, NO cookies are awful
[03:46:57] <dytrivedi> cookies suck
[03:47:05] <innociv> localStorage is good.  Fuck whoever doesn't use those browsers.
[03:47:12] <BlackAnt> lol
[03:47:15] <egrouse> lol
[03:47:16] <egrouse> yes mate
[03:47:18] <BlackAnt> that means fucking productivity
[03:47:19] <unomi> how is the traversal performance?
[03:47:21] <dytrivedi> yeah, support IE9+ only
[03:47:23] <BlackAnt> I wont do that
[03:47:28] <AdvoWork> if ive got something like: $('table.maintable tr:first').after(tableString);  how would i do that if maintable is an id, not a class?
[03:47:28] <BlackAnt> If I were you.
[03:47:40] <innociv> Just make your app work gracefully without the storage, like default stuff.
[03:47:41] <dytrivedi> table#maintable
[03:47:44] <dytrivedi> AND
[03:47:52] <dytrivedi> you don't have to use 'table'
[03:47:54] <innociv> Or you can store it on your server and have an ajax get for the data if they !localStorage
[03:47:55] <dytrivedi> just use #maintable
[03:48:14] <dytrivedi> yeah, but like I said, there are shims for older IEs
[03:48:21] <dytrivedi> use modernizr to detect and fall back
[03:48:27] <innociv> There is flash apis
[03:48:48] <unomi> AdvoWork: also consider that :first is not a native CSS selector
[03:48:58] <innociv> I use localstorage to store settings for people, and if they don't use a decent browser they just don't get settings saved.  Depends how important what in localStorage is
[03:49:06] <innociv> But you shouldn't put something too important in localStorage to begin with
[03:49:10] <innociv> because it can be cleared out
[03:49:18] <unomi> so you aren't getting querySelectorAll performance
[03:49:21] <innociv> So just having no fall back is fine as your app shouldn't relie on it
[03:49:41] <unomi> AdvoWork: instead you get jquery to grab all TRs :p
[03:50:04] <dytrivedi> https://gist.github.com/350433 <-- remy's shim
[03:50:45] <unomi> why the cookie hate? :|
[03:51:05] <khurram> why i am always receving cluetip is not a function ?
[03:51:27] <unomi> be kind to headers
[03:51:36] <khurram> i have defined every thing and confirmed it at their locations and every thing is loaded in the firebug the css file is after all the scripts

[03:55:36] <innociv> unomi because *cookies are sent on every http request*
[03:55:43] <innociv> That wastes a lot of bandwidth
[03:56:00] <innociv> You store 300kb of cookies and that's adding 300kb of data on every page load, ajax, etc.
[03:56:17] <innociv> Cookies are a freaking awful way of storing data UNLESS the server needs to see it.
[03:56:30] <innociv> Cookies are for the server not client
[03:57:48] <khurram> yes
[03:58:00] <khurram> what the f.. he is doing
[04:02:45] <AdvoWork> anyone here ever used jeditable, and then use tablesorter() ? i cant for the life of me get both working together.
[04:03:24] <toxz> can i do something like: $(input:not(:submit,:hidden)')    ?
[04:03:45] <skylamer`> with one " ' " ?
[04:04:16] <toxz> sorry - $('input:not(:submit,:hidden)')    ;-)
[04:04:23] <skylamer`> $("input:not(:submit,:hidden)");
[04:04:24] <skylamer`> may be
[04:04:37] <toxz> what?
[04:04:41] <skylamer`> whats its thiz selector "hidden" ?
[04:04:52] <toxz> hidden input
[04:05:06] <skylamer`> rea lly?
[04:05:26] <toxz> http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[04:05:26] <skylamer`> this is type not pseudo selector :)
[04:05:44] <skylamer`> u mix the types and selectors i look
[04:06:09] <toxz> no it doesnt work because i want to use more than one selectro
[04:06:12] <toxz> selector
[04:06:17] <toxz> :submit,:hidden
[04:06:21] <K1ng> i am extremely sorry people ;(
[04:06:22] <toxz> this syntax is wrong
[04:06:27] <skylamer`> try with the css, not thiz jquery selectorz
[04:06:41] <toxz> and im searching for the right way to do this
[04:06:55] <skylamer`> visible and hidden is different thingz
[04:07:24] <toxz> skylamer` - its the type "hidden" not for display purpose
[04:07:31] <toxz> forget about it
[04:08:09] <skylamer`> there' is no thing bout "display visible"
[04:08:29] <skylamer`> u little mseeed the things
[04:08:59] <toxz> <input type="hidden" name="xyz" value="123" />    - ever heard about this?
[04:09:33] <skylamer`> im telling you
[04:12:15] <toxz> skylamer` - youre right
[04:12:23] <toxz> ive read the docs again :-)
[04:12:23] <toxz> thx
[04:12:58] <toxz> i was sure it selects hidden inputs
[04:13:05] <toxz> type hidden ;-)
[04:13:10] <toxz> damn
[04:13:21] <gnarf> toxz: [type='hidden']
[04:13:35] <gnarf> and thats CSS good too
[04:13:42] <toxz> yo
[04:13:52] <toxz> i thought :hidden is the same
[04:14:16] <toxz> learning every day :-)
[04:15:32] <toxz> a lil strange because there is :radio :checkbox :submit - but ok
[04:20:46] <AdvoWork> anyone here ever used jeditable, and then use tablesorter() ? i cant for the life of me get both working together.
[04:20:56] <smik> How can I make $.getScript do synchronous loading.
[04:21:03] <z3yo> What's the file which make mouse effects ? css ?
[04:23:16] <Haprog> z3yo: you don't make any sense
[04:25:23] <BlackAnt> hmm
[04:26:14] <z3yo> Haprog, when you download JQuery UI lib, you can check a box "Mouse Effect", where are these effects ?
[04:26:24] <z3yo> In the source code
[04:27:02] <BlackAnt> funny world :D
[04:27:16] <BlackAnt> grudging for lil things
[04:27:51] <albacker> can someone please tell me why this is happening on clicking on "following followers" : http://eni.pr-ing.com/kot3.html ?
[04:28:05] <albacker> click once, it hides, than click again..
[04:28:22] <Haprog> z3yo: ah
[04:28:30] <Haprog> dunno
[04:29:57] <z3yo> gosh
[04:30:14] <juha___> z3yo: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/source/browse/trunk/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js?r=3975
[04:30:29] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/13/ How would I copy the prototype functions on the extend as well?

[04:30:43] <z3yo> omg
[04:32:15] <jeroenem> Any idea how to make this modal window work ? http://jsfiddle.net/hXUaz/ now it opens all the items.. but i need it to open only item 1 while click on item 1 and so on
[04:33:51] <VictorCL2> which is faster ,  .children().eq(0)   or next()  ?
[04:35:22] <herrgabriel> has anyone some experience with the serialscroll plugin?
[04:36:30] <gnarf> VictorCL2: they don't return the same thing
[04:37:47] <VictorCL2> no?
[04:38:17] <gnarf> .next() is the next element, .children().eq(0) is the first child
[04:38:25] <herrgabriel> my serialscroll works like a charme, but other a-tags that point to div-elements with an id do not work anymore. instead, they move the serialscroll slide to the right
[04:38:57] <VictorCL2> the first child isnt an element aswell?
[04:39:07] <gnarf> first child isn't a sibling
[04:39:13] <gnarf> .next() gets the next sibling
[04:39:19] <gnarf> it doesn't go down to children
[04:40:05] <VictorCL2> I have  <td><div></div></td> .. in some <td> some not .. I need to check if that div exists .. the fastes way
[04:40:19] <bisco77> hey all...i have a quick question...how would i get this js to start with the filters hidden? https://gist.github.com/922207
[04:45:24] <ruby_on_tails> how can i apply a custom z-index to jquery datepicker ?
[04:46:22] <johanhar> ruby on tails, lol :P
[04:46:52] <astropirate> ruby_on_tails,  $('selector').css({'z-index': 9999})
[04:47:08] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[04:47:26] <ruby_on_tails> i was thinking someway to override the css using the stylesheet
[04:48:08] <astropirate> same thing there use the selector and set the z-index
[04:48:22] <dytrivedi> sup bot-t
[04:48:23] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus‚Äô hangin‚Äô ‚Äôn‚Äô chillin‚Äô
[04:48:36] <ruby_on_tails> ok got a css way to do it
[04:48:40] <astropirate> you might have to use   z-index: 999 !important
[04:48:46] <ruby_on_tails> yea important
[04:51:00] <smik> I want to use getScript synchronously
[04:51:30] <smik> Can I do like $.ajaxSetup to do sync:false and then after the request, put it back to sync:true
[04:52:44] <bisco77> anyone/
[04:52:45] <bisco77> ?
[04:57:55] <kborchers> smik: Why don't you just use $.ajax and set async to false for that single call? I believe your idea should work but have not tested and $.ajax would be simpler
[04:59:34] <mrbrbr> hi!
[04:59:49] <mrbrbr> can someone help me a bit?
[05:00:20] <mrbrbr> i want to dynamically load forms in jquery-ui's dialog
[05:00:41] <mrbrbr> the thing is, forms may contain some additional javascript (validation etc.)
[05:00:57] <mrbrbr> what is the best way to load/unload this javascript?
[05:01:19] <mrbrbr> what problems can i expect?
[05:07:06] <johanhar> Its not a problem to $("#someID").autocomplete(); if someID does not exist? Will that give an error or just continue on?
[05:07:25] <johanhar> How often should I check if the selected element exists?
[05:07:36] <dytrivedi> that depends on your plugin
[05:07:42] <dytrivedi> if it can gracefully fail, that's alright
[05:07:51] <dytrivedi> otherwise you might have to check all the time
[05:09:09] <johanhar> Ok
[05:10:49] <buzzman> hi djquery, here's the code along with the suggestion you gave to check  :visible   >>>  http://jsbin.com/oviye5
[05:11:38] <buzzman> djquery:  but i don't know why it doesn't work ... :-(
[05:12:14] <buzzman> djquery:  if u get the time, plz give it a looksee ... thnx ...
[05:12:17] <djquery>  buzzman: so open up console and do a couple of queries
[05:14:14] <buzzman> djquery:  i mean the IdleTimer code gets executed even if the lightbox popup is open on page ... that's just got me fuddled ...
[05:15:53] <buzzman> djquery:  yes, ur right except i don't know what to query in this case where both the jquery lightbox as well as jquery IdleTimer both work fine ... there's no errors or whatever is why i'm lost ...
[05:17:24] <jeroenem> Does anyone have an idea why the close button isnt working? http://jsfiddle.net/MZB4P/
[05:20:02] <djquery> buzzman: give me a link to the plugin
[05:20:06] <buzzman> djquery:  the test I'm doing is not working  >>>   if(!$('#overlay').is(':visible')) {  ...  }
[05:20:27] <buzzman> djquery:  sure ... 1 sec plz ...
[05:22:18] <djquery> buzzman: not a lotta doc on this one http://krewenki.github.com/jquery-lightbox/
[05:22:43] <buzzman> djquery:  yea :-(
[05:23:22] <xec> jeroenem: the .close element is child of .category
[05:23:27] <mello> question about jquery mobile: it adds things to my URL uncontrollably, and I don't know why. Anyone has an idea how this happens or why?
[05:23:40] <xec> jeroenem: meaning both click events will fire
[05:23:42] <mello> when logging in the url becomes something like : http://localhost/mobi/index.php/en/mobile/dashboard#/mobi/index.php/en/mobile/dashboard
[05:23:47] <buzzman> djquery: but can't we just catch the event or something and chk just before the redirect whether a lightbox is popped open and if yes then abort ... ?
[05:24:28] <xec> jeroenem: http://jsfiddle.net/MZB4P/25/
[05:24:38] <buzzman> djquery: i thot that since both are jquery based, this shud b doable ... no ?
[05:25:49] <buzzman> djquery: oh wait ... just recalled that this guys code builds on the actual Lightbox by Lokesh Dharkar ... lemme get that link ...
[05:26:16] <makinen> I'm having problems with resizing colorbox. The resize function is called when the onComplete event occurs. the problem is that the onComplete event will be triggered every time the colorbox has been resized so the code ends up in infinite loop.
[05:26:44] <buzzman> djquery:  here's the original lightbox guy   >>>   http://www.huddletogether.com/
[05:27:53] <djquery> buzzman: here are all the items that appears to show
[05:27:54] <djquery> '#lightboxImage, #hoverNav, #prevLink, #nextLink'
[05:28:16] <buzzman> djquery: ok ...
[05:29:05] <buzzman> djquery: did u see the jsbin code and execute it to see the effect ... ?
[05:29:18] <makinen> How can I unbind the event handler for onComplete?
[05:29:25] <buzzman> djquery: jsbin is nice ... :-)
[05:29:50] <jeroenem> thanks xec, got it working now ;-)

[05:32:54] <djquery> makinen: on complete of what/
[05:35:35] <makinen> djquery: the onComplete of colorbox
[05:35:53] <makinen> 						$(this).colorbox({width: "640px", innerHeight: "600px", inline: true,
[05:35:53] <makinen> 								href: "#quickprint", onClosed: close_quickprint,
[05:35:53] <makinen> 							  onComplete : function() { resize_quickprint(this)  },
[05:35:53] <makinen> 							});
[05:36:03] <djquery> makinen: dud dont paste code
[05:36:23] <djquery> use jsbin or somethin
[05:36:50] <makinen> sorry, I thought it would be appropriate if there are 4 lines max
[05:37:20] <djquery> $(this).colorbox('setoption', 'oncomplete', nul)
[05:38:00] <djquery> makinen: if it has an option for unbinding that is

[05:41:47] <mello> is there a way to remove the previous page from the DOM in jquery mobile before the new one has loaded?
[05:44:18] <sylow> Hi,how could I dump  a javascript array to i.e. my firebug console, is it possible?
[05:45:05] <sylow> some jquery plugin should scan for images, it makes a thumbnail array from it, but afaik it's empty.. I'd like to dump the thumbnails to view the content, any tips?
[05:46:26] <erichynds> console.log, sylow
[05:47:21] <sylow> erichynds: yeah.. I just tried that but I don't see anything, (also console.log("hello") , nothing)
[05:47:31] <sylow> maybe I have incorrect settings somewhere
[05:47:37] <erichynds> is your console enabled?
[05:47:41] <sylow> yes
[05:47:49] <buzzman> djquery:  so is there no way to do this ... ?
[05:48:46] <djquery> buzzman: witht the lightbox closed try doing $('overlay').length in console
[05:49:09] <djquery> $('#overlay').length
[05:49:47] <sylow> erichynds: I can select some items in the dropdown of 'console' , which one is usef for that console.log command?
[05:49:58] <erichynds> wat
[05:50:05] <erichynds> it's just the console tab
[05:50:09] <erichynds> no dropdown or anything
[05:50:12] <buzzman> djquery: yep done that but no cheeze ... cuz the code doesn't exist in html ... :-(
[05:51:47] <sylow> erichynds: I hoped so yes, but there are more settings (under that arrow) like 'Show js errors', 'Show XmlHttp requests' ,.. thought maybe it has something to do with that
[05:51:58] <erichynds> negative
[05:52:01] <erichynds> as long as it's enabled
[05:52:16] <djquery> buzzman: maybe time to look at a different one
[05:52:20] <erichynds> if you enabled it for the first time you may have to refresh the page, but that's about it
[05:53:17] <sylow> erichynds: making progress.. my log call was inside a function, which wasn't called it seems :s
[05:53:40] <buzzman> djquery:  can u advise what the lightbox code should have in order to catch it in our test ... ?
[05:58:20] <sylow> erichynds: I thought everything between JQuery(function() { ... } ) was processed?
[05:58:32] <erichynds> it is
[06:02:15] <johanhar> Anyone familiar with the validation plugin? Can I make a element required (or some other rule) if another element is filled?
[06:02:27] <sylow> erichynds: any ideas then? http://pastebin.com/fXTNq6dF
[06:03:14] <erichynds> sylow: are you getting any syntax errors?
[06:03:19] <erichynds> like, is jQuery actually defined
[06:03:41] <sylow> yes it is
[06:03:51] <sylow> I don't have any errors afaik
[06:03:57] <erichynds> thumbnails is undefined
[06:04:03] <sylow> yeah, i know
[06:04:06] <erichynds> ?
[06:04:08] <erichynds> so there you go
[06:04:25] <erichynds> comment that line out and test2 shows up
[06:04:53] <sylow> but that's not a syntax error or is it ? ;)
[06:05:08] <buzzman> djquery:  as far as I have checked, most all lightbox code is generated by JS and so is almost never in the HTML, so forgeting about the current technique we are using, is there no other way to detect if a lightbox is popped open on a page ... ?
[06:07:07] <sylow> erichynds: it doesn't , but I have other js too (no jquery though) which might error, could that interfere with the jquery part?
[06:07:13] <djquery> dont know got a splittin headache
[06:07:23] <erichynds> sylow: yes
[06:07:24] <djquery> maybe eric has a hint for you
[06:07:59] <buzzman> djquery:  oops ... just my luck ... sry to hear that ... :-(
[06:08:36] <sylow> erichynds: it's some old MM_swapImage.. if killing that solves the problem, I'm very thankful to you
[06:09:04] <erichynds> sylow: remove things one by one until you figure out what is preventing that console.log
[06:09:19] <p2w> running into a "mismatch fragment identifier" error when rendering jquery tabs in rails app using haml
[06:09:27] <buzzman> erichynds: hi ... per djquery's ref, can I request a looksee at this issue i got   >>>   http://jsbin.com/oviye5
[06:09:28] <makinen> is there some global variable holding the references to event handlers?
[06:10:11] <p2w> the tabs render properly, however, its not finding the panel divs. wondering if anyone else has seen this behavior
[06:10:41] <p2w> additionally the generated html looks right..
[06:11:45] <p2w> any insight appreciated!
[06:14:26] <djquery> p2w: is it putting some extra stuff in the href or the <a in the tab?
[06:15:24] <fabiobik> how to change div id with jquery?
[06:16:13] <kborchers> fabiobik .attr("id", new_val)
[06:16:23] <kborchers> ?attr @ fabiobik
[06:16:24] <bot-t> fabiobik, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:16:47] <p2w> djquery: i dont think so, the a tag looks like this: %a{:href=>"#tour"} Tour with the generated html being <a href="#tour">Tour</a>
[06:16:49] <djquery> fabiobik: realy screws with it
[06:17:39] <fabiobik> like this ? $('#activeh2').attr("id", 'normalh2');
[06:18:18] <kborchers> fabiobik sure but if you're trying to keep track of state, classes are better
[06:18:39] <p2w> djquery: additionally the generated html for the panel divs looks right, i.e. <div id="tour'>........</div>
[06:19:01] <djquery> p2w: are they in the same container
[06:19:07] <p2w> yes
[06:19:27] <djquery> only thing i can think of is the css is messed up
[06:19:39] <djquery> hover and click on the tabs work?
[06:20:28] <p2w> djquery: yes it does and the console is showing state changes, etc on hover so i'm really at a loss as to why its not finding the panel divs
[06:20:54] <fabiobik> kborchers check this http://programais.com/labs/php/members/login.php
[06:21:09] <ohcibi> i have an input element whichs innerHeight is 13 (width) + 4 (padding) + 2(border) = 19, but innerHeight() returns 17 (firefox4) is this normal for inputs?

[06:29:24] <kborchers> fabiobik you should change those to classes rather than id's. i think that will clear up your issue or at least get it moving in the right direction.

[06:43:55] <cscsaba242> how can make a function from a part of the code ? which can be called ?
[06:45:22] <sint> hey i just started to write a little google maps plugin but i stuck at the first lines. http://jsfiddle.net/dHQWn/ i'll always end up with "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" on the new google.maps line. is there something wrong with the code? the js file from google is loading fine

[06:54:29] <gym_jane> back
[06:54:45] <gym_jane> aamir, you know the json link thingie you did for me?
[06:54:49] <gym_jane> remember*
[06:55:08] <Aamir> gym_jane: yes :|
[06:55:31] <gym_jane> i can't find the final version :'(
[06:55:49] <Aamir> which version do you have? paste it here
[06:55:58] <Altreus> sometimes when using .offset() to set an element's location, while the top value works as expected, the left value ignores what I give it and actually sets some crazy negative number
[06:56:12] <Altreus> Anyone seen this before and hav a clue what I might have done?
[06:56:27] <Altreus> The object is visible at this point; it has to be so I can use its size
[06:56:41] <rethus> i have an array wit 10 objects. How can i create one big object out of this?
[06:56:44] <Aamir> Altreus:  i had this issue when i set min and max width of body or main wrapper
[06:56:49] <gym_jane> http://jsbin.com/arase5/edit
[06:57:17] <Altreus> Aamir: Did the offset() call work the second time, but not the first?
[06:57:38] <Aamir> Altreus:  for me it was wrong all the time
[06:57:41] <Altreus> ah
[06:57:47] <Aamir> gym_jane:  i think that is the final version
[06:57:49] <Aamir> :/
[06:57:55] <Aamir> what prob do u have
[06:57:55] <Altreus> okay well it's a good place to start :)
[06:58:11] <gym_jane> lol i think that is!
[06:58:14] <gym_jane> *happy*
[06:58:34] <Aamir> gym_jane: wat
[06:58:36] <Aamir> wat
[06:58:50] <Aamir> bot-t: sup?
[06:58:50] <bot-t> Aamir, You may rely on it.
[06:59:08] <gym_jane> actually it isn't
[06:59:18] <gym_jane> because it is not setting the link with the anchor text
[06:59:28] <Aamir> gym_jane: wait
[06:59:32] <gym_jane> k
[06:59:45] <b1lly> i know the .load() reflects when an image has been fully loaded, and a .ready() reflects when an object is loaded (but not fully).
[06:59:56] <b1lly> is there a function to detect if a flash file has ben fully loaded?
[07:00:24] <Aamir> gym_jane:  http://jsbin.com/arase5/5/edit ?
[07:01:32] <Altreus> Seems like it's symptomatic of it having position: absolute but not having been given an absolute position at that time
[07:01:47] <gym_jane> yes but what about the link?
[07:01:56] <gym_jane> the anchor can't be linked to the url?

[07:06:40] <khmer> who wants to help me get a file input proxy working
[07:06:48] <khmer> c'mon, anyone? doesn't it sound fun?
[07:08:26] <Guest50503> Could someone help me out with selecting the first empty child of a parent>>>>
[07:08:26] <Guest50503> $('#cat' + config.CategoryId + 'set' + config.DataSetId + ' .maxdata .datasetbox .chartarea:empty')
[07:08:26] <Guest50503> I have the ID, then I am trying to select the first chartarea that is empty
[07:08:57] <khmer> Guest23918: add a .eq(0) on the end of that
[07:09:01] <khmer> bcarr0505: ^^
[07:09:18] <bcarr0505> awesome :D
[07:09:22] <bcarr0505> thanks khmer
[07:09:33] <khmer> bcarr0505: you could also add the pseudoclass :first but i find the second function to be faster in jsperf
[07:09:36] <Aamir> gym_jane:  http://jsbin.com/arase5/7/edit
[07:09:41] <khmer> now, okay people
[07:09:43] <khmer> http://jsfiddle.net/vQY2m/1/
[07:09:48] <khmer> who can get this working in FF3.6?
[07:10:38] <bcarr0505> khmer so it should be $('#cat' + config.CategoryId + 'set' + config.DataSetId + ' .maxdata .datasetbox .chartarea:empty.eq(0)')?
[07:10:50] <khmer> bcarr0505: not quite
[07:10:57] <gym_jane> That is much better Aamir :D
[07:11:00] <gym_jane> thank you
[07:11:06] <khmer> $('#cat' + config.CategoryId + 'set' + config.DataSetId + ' .maxdata .datasetbox .chartarea:empty').eq(0)
[07:11:08] <Aamir> gym_jane: u welcome

[07:12:59] <bcarr0505> darcyclark I really enjoyed your presentation at jqCon
[07:13:20] <knapper_tech> I'm dealing with a CMS that outputs some form validation code that I would like to wrap in a function definition so that i can call it
[07:13:42] <ralphholzmann> bcarr0505: spell his name right and he'll probably respond ;)
[07:14:11] <knapper_tech> ie I grab a new page fragment, with HTML, and then wrap a function around code inside a script block and then call that function
[07:14:17] <bcarr0505> oh snap
[07:14:24] <bcarr0505> darcyclarke I really enjoyed your presentation at jqCon
[07:14:45] <darcyclarke> bcarr0505 thanks man
[07:14:48] <knapper_tech> Any suggest yes kittens?
[07:16:42] <darcyclarke> bcarr0505 anything specific about it? (ie. pictures of extremely close urinals etc.)
[07:16:50] <knapper_tech> Could I run a getScript and then load the HTML into the right element?
[07:17:31] <knapper_tech> or will the lack of <script> tags kill that flow?
[07:18:26] <bcarr0505> darcyclarke: Actually, the presentation itself looked stunning, but besides that, the examples were great.
[07:18:48] <knapper_tech> FF just crashed.  no reply?
[07:19:06] <DragoneneWork_> knapper_tech: no :)
[07:19:11] <knapper_tech> aight
[07:20:01] <bcarr0505> darcyclarke it wasn't one of the presentations that were too wordy.
[07:21:11] <darcyclarke> bcarr0505 sweet. Yea, I knew it was the end of a long conference and some people wanted a nice fluffy talk to cap things off, they already got overwhelmed with awesomeness from guys like paul_irish
[07:22:48] <darcyclarke> bcarr0505  I've also tweeked that talk since I gave it in San Fran. The last half I feel is a lot meatier now going through processes / workflows right into some working examples. Will  probably give the updated talk up here in Toronto soon.
[07:23:01] <bcarr0505> darcyclark the odd thing was I got help from wesbos shortly before the conference... and when you showed dealpage I thought you were him haha
[07:23:16] <darcyclarke> haha
[07:23:31] <darcyclarke> wesbos is my bro
[07:24:03] <bcarr0505> biologically?
[07:24:07] <knapper_tech> can i call script within a particular div?
[07:24:13] <knapper_tech> that's also in <script> tags?
[07:24:14] <darcyclarke> not really my brother but he lives about 10 minutes away from me. We both work on DealPage
[07:24:22] <bcarr0505> ah lol
[07:25:00] <darcyclarke> bcarr0505 some people say we look like it though: http://dealpage.me/about
[07:25:18] <bcarr0505> you both have the fin in the front haha
[07:26:07] <darcyclarke> yea, the faux hawk is popular in the jQuery community, apparently lol ralphholzmann rocks one along with danheberden
[07:27:05] <coachz> Anyone know a way to use an RTE like tinymce (or any) to do revision tracking ?
[07:28:19] <mello> anybody know why attr function stopped working when i upgraded to 1.6.1?
[07:28:28] <ralphholzmann> hellls yes
[07:28:33] <ralphholzmann> my hawk will fuck you up
[07:28:45] <coachz> chicken hawk ?
[07:28:46] <ralphholzmann> yet, i still look professional in a business setting

[07:29:41] <gym_jane> Aamir, is it possible to include a remote .css file with jquery?
[07:29:56] <Aamir> gym_jane: yes
[07:30:41] <bulow> Anyone guess about this? IE7, Permission denied, line 16 char 2822 of jquery-1.6.1.min.js, caused when I try to open a jquery.fancybox.
[07:30:46] <darcyclarke> ralphholzmann are you saying faux hawks are considered "business casual" now? sweet!
[07:30:55] <ralphholzmann> oh man, totally
[07:31:02] <ralphholzmann> party on top
[07:31:07] <ralphholzmann> business on the sides
[07:31:11] <darcyclarke> haha
[07:31:13] <darcyclarke> love it
[07:31:46] <bcarr0505> so its the new mullet?
[07:31:53] <ralphholzmann> yes

[07:32:12] <ralphholzmann> once upon a time, the mullet got you laid

[07:48:49] <skylamer`> yes
[07:48:59] <skylamer`> just don t put href
[07:48:59] <xDROPx> maprops <a href="#">
[07:49:15] <skylamer`> or with # and prevent default : )

[07:49:59] <djquery> khmer: works for me in chrome
[07:50:09] <khmer> djquery: yeah but not in FF3, which i have to support
[07:50:15] <khmer> i actually just had a crazy idea
[07:50:29] <djquery> khmer: dont have ff3 to test with
[07:50:34] <skylamer`> share : )
[07:50:49] <khmer> i will, i just have to see if it works
[07:51:18] <madprops> ive tried http://www.site.com/# onclick='$('.inputvalue).focus()' but it wont work
[07:51:28] <skylamer`> "crazy" ideas more often works :)
[07:51:46] <djquery> madprops  $('a').click(function(e){  e.preventDefault(); do other stuff });
[07:52:37] <djquery> khmer: madprops: if you want to use preventDefault() you gotta pass e in the function
[07:52:39] <BlackAnt> what a funcking busy day
[07:53:14] <khmer> djquery: oh fair enough, but when the a tag doesn't have an href, it doesn't *have* a default
[07:53:23] <khmer> djquery: that's why i use a's without hrefs in a lot of the stuff i do
[07:53:32] <khmer> djquery: along with a { cursor: pointer }
[07:53:35] <djquery> khmer: still I do it the same way so I dont forget
[07:54:18] <khmer> djquery: the fewer args you bring into the closure, the better it performs, but i see the merit to always adding it

[07:56:18] <djquery> coachz: there are several editing plugins out there but u would have to build ur own revision trackin
[07:56:26] <Layke> skylamer: I will only load jQuery when I actualy need it. (Which for the sake of this point will be when someone clicks a particular tab and a Xhr is fired to load the content).

[08:00:58] <djquery> Whirl3d: nope you still on what u were appending to
[08:01:21] <knapper_tech> I'm looking in the post response, where there is some <script>
[08:01:34] <knapper_tech> so it's obviously coming back from the server, and even being called
[08:02:00] <knapper_tech> because i'm logging functions inside those tags, but firebug won't display any script tags inserted into the page
[08:02:26] <shamess> knapper_tech: It'll just insert hte literal text inside the <script> tag, but won't run them.
[08:02:51] <Whirl3d> djquery, thanks for the reply. That explains about half of my problem.
[08:03:07] <shamess> knapper_tech: you'll have to use the callback function to trigger javascript to run

[08:05:59] <bot-t> fabiobik, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:06:33] <shamess> knapper_tech: oh, I'm not sure then. I'd have expect you to be able to see if in firebug.
[08:06:34] <djquery> fabiobik: or take a look at ?ui.menubar

[08:14:37] <necromancer> is there a less verbose way to do this? https://gist.github.com/1042723 what it's doing is fading in a modal dialog when you mouse over a link, keeping it when you mouse over the dialog, and fading it out when you mouse over anywhere else on the page except the link & dialog.
[08:14:49] <necromancer> i feel like this is pretty common functionality..
[08:15:05] <buzzman> is there anyway to detect if a lightbox is popped open on a page ... ? i'm doing this but it's not working   >>>   http://jsbin.com/oviye5
[08:16:09] <djquery> necromancer: well you could cache some of those vars
[08:16:30] <buzzman> i meant that i used  >>>  if(!$('#overlay').is(':visible')) { do stuff } but this does not work ...
[08:16:41] <necromancer> buzzman: #lightbox shouldn't be in the DOM if no lightbox is present, right?
[08:16:46] <necromancer> (that's the way facebox works anyway)
[08:17:10] <buzzman> necromancer: yes right ...
[08:17:42] <necromancer> if so, just test if $('#lightbox').length > 0, if that's true then there's a #lightbox in the DOM somewhere, and that will mean that it's visible
[08:18:05] <buzzman> necromancer: if u look @ that code and run it then wait about 30 secs, u'll see that the idleTimer redirects even with that if test in there ...
[08:18:10] <gnarf> necromancer: the > 0 is pointless
[08:18:29] <necromancer> gnarf: doesn't .length return an integer? how else would you compare that?
[08:18:33] <gnarf> if ( $("#lightbox").length ) is fine
[08:18:35] <necromancer> does 0 = false in javascript too?
[08:18:36] <gnarf> ?js 0
[08:18:38] <bot-t> gnarf: 0
[08:18:40] <djquery> gnarf: necromancer: truthiness man
[08:18:44] <necromancer> oh cool
[08:18:44] <gnarf> ?js !!0
[08:18:46] <bot-t> gnarf: false
[08:18:46] <necromancer> i never knew that
[08:18:57] <necromancer> ?js if (0)
[08:18:58] <bot-t> necromancer: SyntaxError: syntax error
[08:19:00] <necromancer> boo
[08:19:08] <necromancer> ?js if (0) { 'salkfasldjfs'; }
[08:19:10] <bot-t> necromancer: undefined
[08:19:16] <necromancer> ?js if (0) { 'salkfasldjfs'; } else { 'kladsfjlskdjfldasjflkadsjlkfsdjlf'; }
[08:19:17] <bot-t> necromancer: "kladsfjlskdjfldasjflkadsjlkfsdjlf"
[08:19:20] <theju> why is event.originalEvent undefined for a few DOM elements?
[08:19:20] <buzzman> necromancer:  i did try that but the lightbox div is generated by jquery code and it's not in the html, so this test fails too ...
[08:19:21] <necromancer> wow
[08:19:35] <kborchers> hey gnarf, i love the word truthiness ;)
[08:19:45] <djquery> ?js if ('') { 'salkfasldjfs'; } else { 'kladsfjlskdjfldasjflkadsjlkfsdjlf'; }
[08:19:46] <bot-t> djquery: "kladsfjlskdjfldasjflkadsjlkfsdjlf"
[08:20:01] <gnarf> kborchers: trutyness ;)
[08:20:03] <necromancer> buzzman: oh yeah you need to execute that idleTimer condition in a callback
[08:20:47] <buzzman> necromancer:  can u plz show me in that code plz ... ?
[08:21:27] <buzzman> necromancer:  and of course do text here the new url on jsbin
[08:22:34] <buzzman> gnarf:  that rhymes with frtiness ... ;-)
[08:22:48] <buzzman> gnarf:  i mean frutiness
[08:23:29] <buzzman> ugh ... i'm typing garbage ... plz ignore ...
[08:24:06] <cybertronxy> boredom
[08:24:26] <buzzman> yup
[08:26:05] <innociv> Hey ajpiano?
[08:26:19] <buzzman> necromancer:  ru taking a look @ it ... ?
[08:28:04] <buzzman> gnarf: ping
[08:28:41] <necromancer> buzzman: alright so what you want to do is bind a click action to every .lightbox link on the page, and run that condition in it
[08:28:45] <necromancer> don't return false or the link won't do anything
[08:29:13] <necromancer> buzzman: is there a callback in your lightbox plugin? like after the click happens? i'm not familiar with it so i don't know
[08:30:13] <necromancer> but the best way to do what you're doing is to capture the moment just after someone clicks a .lightbox link and run the condition there, basically. normally, plugins come complete with a callback function that can be executed after it's done
[08:30:23] <necromancer> i don't use lightbox so i'm not familiar with how it works
[08:31:07] <necromancer> but you can't do $('.lightbox').click without overriding the click bound in the lightbox plugin...so either you'll need a callback or you'll need to find where the click is bound in the plugin and inject that code in there.
[08:31:25] <gnarf> what?
[08:31:32] <buzzman> necromancer:  umm .... but what i'm trying to do is stop the IdleTimer code from executing the redirect if a lightbox popup is open ... so how does binding an event to the lightbox enabled links help ... sry, maybe i didn't get you right ...
[08:31:39] <ch3mical> Override?
[08:32:10] <ch3mical> I thought objects could have multiple events of the same type?
[08:32:18] <necromancer> can they?
[08:32:19] <z3yo> Is there another solution that "$(this).parent().parent().parent().find(.." ?
[08:32:20] <ch3mical> I've never tried having 2 click events, I guess
[08:32:34] <necromancer> i've never needed to either
[08:32:39] <necromancer> because you can just put them in the same event
[08:32:49] <kborchers> ?closest @ z3yo
[08:32:50] <bot-t> z3yo, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[08:32:54] <ch3mical> necromancer: yeah
[08:32:56] <necromancer> regardless of whether you can or can't, i don't think it's a very good idea and you're just opening yourself to a potential bug down the road
[08:33:09] <necromancer> so i wouldn't even try it
[08:33:19] <necromancer> cleanest way would be to inject the condition in the click
[08:33:25] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's probably sound advice
[08:33:26] <buzzman> necromancer:  is the objective of what i'm trying to achieve ok ... ?
[08:33:42] <necromancer> buzzman: i don't really know what idleTimer is either, or what "the redirect" is.
[08:33:56] <miwillhite> hey all‚Ä¶I've been bumping into objects that look like this: jQuery.jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[0]
[08:34:05] <miwillhite> and I'm not sure why‚Ä¶can someone explain what that is?
[08:34:15] <innociv> Are you doing $() on something that's already a jquery object?
[08:34:38] <miwillhite> yeah‚Ä¶for example, I'm grabbing an existing list, to save for later
[08:34:44] <z3yo> kborchers, I  used parents, it's works
[08:34:53] <miwillhite> when I reference the variable that contains the list I get that object
[08:34:55] <necromancer> buzzman: i also don't understand how idleTimer is executing when it hasn't been bound
[08:35:00] <necromancer> to any click action
[08:35:24] <necromancer> buzzman: if you want the reverse it's a lot easier. just do $('a').not('.facebox').click
[08:35:33] <necromancer> that'll return every <a> that's not class="facebox"
[08:35:57] <necromancer> not() selectors are just like $() selectors, you can do .not('.facebox, .facebox-2')
[08:36:08] <necromancer> iirc
[08:36:58] <buzzman> necromancer:  IdleTimer is a jquery plugin that allows a customizable countdown time from the moment a user is idle on page (no mouse/kbd movement) so then after a certain time we can do something and the redirct is what we do ... so what i'm trying to do is have the IdleTimer ONLY do the redirect IF there is no Lightbox popped open on the page ... makes sense now ?
[08:38:12] <buzzman> necromancer:  u can see the code / run the code here   >>>   http://jsbin.com/oviye5
[08:38:35] <necromancer> buzzman: yeah, my solution should work for you. select every <a> and use the .not() function to filter out anything with the class .lightbox. i will not write the code for you because you'll learn better if you write it
[08:40:32] <buzzman> necromancer:  ok i see what u saying now ... thnx ... lemme try that ...
[08:41:28] <buzzman> necromancer:  oops ... just recalled that the IdleTimer is bound to the whole document and not to any element ... ???
[08:41:59] <buzzman> necromancer:  maybe it will still work ... giving it a shot ...
[08:42:41] <necromancer> buzzman: you can still execute the idletimer code in a .click action the way i said it
[08:43:37] <djquery> necromancer: buzzman: too bad the lightbox doesnt give a callback on open
[08:44:11] <necromancer> djquery: yeah but really, how many times are you gonna need a callback for a lightbox?
[08:46:54] <buzzman> necromancer:  yes i understand ... but the IdleTimer is already implemented at the theme layer in the CMS .. so it'll be a problem to change & apply it to click actions now ... can't it be done any other way where it just checks if a lightbox is actually popped up on the page before doing the redirect ... ?
[08:47:32] <necromancer> buzzman: no, because all your js is executed on DOM ready, which is before the lightbox is in the DOM. you need to execute that code after the lightbox pops up
[08:47:46] <necromancer> JS is executed as it's encountered, from top to bottom
[08:47:53] <necromancer> once it's done, it's done.
[08:48:49] <buzzman> necromancer:  hmm ... how about we abort the IdleTimer as soon as we pop a lightbox ... ? that should work ... no?
[08:51:28] <buzzman> necromancer:  the IdleTimer plug-in has an API with this code available   >>>    $.idleTimer('destroy');
[08:52:01] <buzzman> necromancer:  but then my issue is how to run it after the lightbox is closed ... ?
[08:52:03] <necromancer> buzzman: it will work if you can find where the open lightbox action happens
[08:53:11] <buzzman> necromancer:  the open lightbox action happens @ the click ...
[08:53:52] <necromancer> buzzman: you need to find it in the lightbox plugin code
[08:53:55] <necromancer> if that's what you want to do
[08:54:17] <necromancer> if you want to execute code when someone opens the lightbox, you need to bind a click action to .lightbox, .lightbox-2 and try that first. if that doesn't work, look in the plugin
[08:54:22] <necromancer> and inject your custom code there
[08:54:40] <buzzman> necromancer:  can't i have a listener or sumthin to chk when the lightbox pops ? so then this listener "destroys" the IdleTimer and also on Lightbox close, again runs the IdleTimer ... ?
[08:54:53] <LeaFlashDev> hello I have a header div with 2 buttons to change the content on the div below I would like to not refresh the page when I do that but just changed the content of the div, any ideas ?
[08:55:45] <necromancer> buzzman: that's what i just described to you. bind a click: $('.lightbox, .lightbox-2').click(function() { /* kill the ideltimer */ });
[08:56:09] <necromancer> if that doesn't work, you'll need to find in the plugin where the click is bound and put your idletimer code at the end of that (but before the return false/e.preventDefault call!)
[08:56:28] <Taftse|Work> hey LeaFlashDev
[08:56:39] <khmer> all right, who was asking about how i fixed that file browse upload thing?
[08:56:40] <necromancer> when JS encounters a return false it stops executing code after that in the function. so any code after a return false won't be executed
[08:56:57] <LeaFlashDev> lol Taftse|Work
[08:57:02] <khmer> http://jsfiddle.net/hPznp/4/ <-- i didn't pilot this technique, but this is the most efficient jquery implementation of it that i know how to do
[08:57:04] <LeaFlashDev> you are evrywhere
[08:57:23] <Taftse|Work> im in the cloud :P
[08:57:26] <Kambfhase> LeaFlashDev: Try .hide()/.show()/.toggle() on .click()
[08:57:57] <buzzman> necromancer:  k i see ... lemme try this ... thnx man ...
[08:58:41] <buzzman> necromancer++
[08:58:51] <necromancer> hah

[09:02:04] <Phil-Work> I would like to know who is responsible for witing IE9's Javascript parser so I may do nasty things to them
[09:02:32] <Kambfhase> lol, wut?
[09:02:34] <Phil-Work> following that, I would like to know how to get the /real/ height of the contents of an iframe such that I may resize the iframe to be the same size as the content and thus not scroll
[09:02:46] <Taftse|Work> probably the same person who wrote the parser for 6 7 and 8
[09:03:10] <Phil-Work> $('#click-track-iframe').contents().find('html').outerHeight()
[09:03:16] <Phil-Work> this works in all browsers except IE
[09:03:37] <Taftse|Work> Phil-Work, you could put a <div around the iframe and test that
[09:03:49] <Phil-Work> Taftse|Work, hm? :S
[09:04:00] <Taftse|Work> get the hight of that div
[09:04:03] <Phil-Work> I want the height of the contents of the iframe, not the iframe itself
[09:04:17] <Phil-Work> so that I can then resize the iframe to be the same height as the contents
[09:04:20] <Taftse|Work> or something much more simple dont support ie :P
[09:04:42] <Phil-Work> I wish that was an option
[09:05:13] <Taftse|Work> did you google the problem ?
[09:05:16] <Phil-Work> perhaps I need what is effectively $(document) but of the iframe
[09:05:22] <kborchers> Phil-Work untested but have you tried .find('body')?
[09:05:24] <Phil-Work> Taftse|Work, yes - I didn't find anything of use
[09:05:25] <Taftse|Work> probably
[09:05:47] <Phil-Work> kborchers, aha!
[09:05:49] <Phil-Work> so body works
[09:06:03] <Phil-Work> but that broke another browser - which is why I'm using html in the first place
[09:06:09] <kborchers> doh!
[09:06:12] <Phil-Work> I guess I should compare the height of html and body and take the largest
[09:06:15] <Phil-Work> thanks D:
[09:06:17] <Phil-Work> *:D
[09:06:20] <kborchers> np
[09:06:35] <Taftse|Work>  // fix png's for IE 6
[09:06:35] <Taftse|Work>                                         if ($.browser.msie && $.browser.version < 7) {
[09:06:52] <Taftse|Work> do that test if it is true use body else use html
[09:07:31] <Taftse|Work> i hope my site works on ie 9
[09:07:58] <kborchers> i can test if it's live and you tell me what to look for
[09:08:09] <Kambfhase> $.browser is deprecated
[09:08:27] <Taftse|Work> since when and what do i use instead ?
[09:08:41] <Phil-Work> so I took the largest value of body and html
[09:08:45] <Kambfhase> Feature detection.
[09:08:47] <kborchers> you should find a solution that doesn't require browser sniffing ;)
[09:08:58] <kborchers> Kambfhase +1
[09:09:04] <Phil-Work> but this made IE have the same issue as the other browser had with using body - the height is off by a little bit and it scrolls slightly
[09:09:19] <Phil-Work> is there any way to get what is effectively the document of an iframe?
[09:09:21] <kborchers> maybe check for scroll then
[09:09:22] <Phil-Work> like $(document)
[09:09:42] <Phil-Work> kborchers, any idea how I might check if the iframe is scrolling?
[09:10:56] <kborchers> $('#click-track-iframe').contents().find('body').scrollHeight() ?
[09:11:22] <kborchers> no, never mind
[09:12:43] <Kambfhase> Phil try window.frames and affiliates: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.frames
[09:12:50] <Kambfhase> Phil-Work: ^
[09:14:35] <kborchers> Phil-Work: well, maybe. you could use what i posted earlier, add a little bit to it and set the iframe height to that number and i think it should work. again, untested.
[09:21:54] <falcom> possible to retrieve input values of an input that is in an iframe?
[09:22:15] <Kambfhase> yes, if you do know the iframe
[09:22:53] <Kambfhase> or try $('iframe').contents().find('input').val()
[09:24:34] <insign> Hello, im new to jquery, how can I use something like .substitute of mootools?
[09:24:54] <erichynds> what does that do?
[09:27:33] <insign> http://mootools.net/docs/core/Types/String#String:substitute
[09:27:48] <insign> is a way to use JSON in a string
[09:28:28] <eddiemonge> so its basically php's sprintf
[09:29:13] <systemfault> C's printf :P
[09:29:13] <eddiemonge> and there is no way to do it in jquery but it looks like all it is, is a regex search and replace.
[09:29:56] <erichynds> yeah jquery doesn't have that
[09:30:14] <insign> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2621170/has-any-method-like-substitute-of-mootools-in-jquery
[09:30:18] <systemfault> Makes me what to troll :/
[09:30:39] <systemfault> jQuery: Y U HAVE USELESS ANIMATIONS BUT NO SUBSTITUTE?
[09:30:48] <eddiemonge> oops i shouldnt part a room by accident
[09:30:58] <Haprog> why don't you just implement the function yourself?
[09:31:05] <systemfault> eddiemonge: There's jQuery.template but perhaps it does too much.
[09:31:36] <insign> thanks, I'll use the tip of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2621170/has-any-method-like-substitute-of-mootools-in-jquery
[09:31:42] <Kambfhase> jQuery is a DOM utility library not a string parser
[09:32:38] <insign> how can I create a new element on jquery?
[09:32:41] <eddiemonge> systemfault: thats also a beta product
[09:32:48] <systemfault> eddiemonge: I know :/
[09:32:58] <tbranyen> jQuery( new String("lol") ).first() === "l"
[09:32:58] <eddiemonge> insign $("<div />')
[09:33:00] <tbranyen> heh
[09:33:20] <eddiemonge> tbranyen: hey. my turn or yours?
[09:33:22] <insign> humm
[09:33:25] <Kambfhase> tbranyen: that will fail in IE ;)
[09:33:27] <tbranyen> eddiemonge: pretty sure its yours
[09:33:32] <tbranyen> Kambfhase: how so?
[09:33:41] <Kambfhase> or atleast in some old versions
[09:33:45] <tbranyen> Kambfhase: how so?
[09:33:49] <eddiemonge> some old versions?
[09:33:52] <eddiemonge> you mean 6?
[09:33:55] <tbranyen> that should be valid in 6
[09:34:08] <Krinkle> AAAAAAAAAAAH, googleapis-ajax-jquery is 404 ERREURed
[09:34:17] <Kambfhase> iirc the bracket notation does not work for strings in IE6
[09:34:24] <insign> in mootools, $$('.something') returns an array with all element the have the class something, how can I do this on jquery?
[09:34:28] <Krinkle> The end of the world has come, good bye fols.
[09:34:34] <eddiemonge> Krinkle: no its not. what link are you using?
[09:34:36] <tbranyen> insign: $(".something").get()
[09:34:53] <eddiemonge> insign: drop the first $ and there you go

[09:35:21] <eddiemonge> works for me. try doing a traceroute to it
[09:35:23] <fabiobik> hi

[09:36:32] <dancannon> Ooops :P
[09:36:33] <Tobsn> anyone an idea why jquery bbq and template wouldnt work with IE8? i get here obj doesnt support method on $.tmpl()
[09:37:04] <fabiobik> kambfhase F5 please
[09:37:13] <fabiobik> kambfhase refresh the page
[09:37:52] <fabiobik> kambfhase the fadeOut is working fine but the fadeIn not
[09:37:52] <eddiemonge> Tobsn: but it works everywhere else?
[09:38:06] <Tobsn> eddiemonge, yep
[09:38:08] <Tobsn> even IE6
[09:38:14] <Tobsn> erm
[09:38:15] <Tobsn> 7
[09:38:46] <Tobsn> firefox, chrome, safari, firefox 4, ie7 - works... IE8 doesnt know $.bbq and $.tmpl are libs
[09:38:52] <Kambfhase> fabiobik: that code in your head is invalid
[09:38:52] <Tobsn> its like it doesnt load the script src's
[09:39:16] <fabiobik> Kambfhase what code
[09:39:24] <insign> have .each() a short way to do?
[09:39:26] <eddiemonge> fabiobik: you need to use live or delegate. and why are you changing the id? just use .data() or a class even
[09:39:38] <eddiemonge> insign: short way to do what?
[09:40:02] <fabiobik> eddiemonge whats that? live or delegate
[09:40:03] <Kambfhase> oh, wait, i was wrong. crazy indenting
[09:40:09] <Tobsn> eddiemonge, any ideas?
[09:40:22] <Tobsn> i couldnt find anything that would solve it in the github issues
[09:40:36] <eddiemonge> fabiobik: see ? delegate
[09:40:37] <bot-t> fabiobik, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:40:41] <fabiobik> Kambfhase what
[09:40:41] <insign> eddiemonge, in mootools, if I'm not wrong, $$('.something').destroy() will remove all elements that have the class .something
[09:40:42] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Tobsn
[09:40:43] <bot-t> Tobsn, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:40:51] <eddiemonge> fabiobik: and Kambfhase is correct. jshint.com your js code
[09:41:07] <Kambfhase> ne i am not correct, when you see it ;)
[09:41:10] <eddiemonge> insign: $('.something').remove()
[09:41:11] <kborchers> insign just drop first $
[09:41:23] <fabiobik> eddiemonge if worng why some things work?
[09:41:31] <insign> thanks
[09:41:42] <Tobsn> kampfhase, there is not much code... $.tmpl( 'name', data ); - it reports $.tmpl is not a supported method
[09:41:47] <Tobsn> only IE8
[09:41:56] <Kambfhase> Tobsn: is you page live?
[09:41:57] <fabiobik> kambfhase can you be more specific??
[09:41:59] <Tobsn> yes
[09:42:07] <Kambfhase> link?
[09:42:15] <gym_jane> aamir, is that method jsonp?
[09:42:21] <eddiemonge> fabiobik: you are missing the  }): at the end
[09:42:23] <dancannon> Ok so the problem I am having is that my code doesnt run very well, I believe that is because my code is badly written so if somebody could look at my code or point me in the right direction that would be great. Here is my code https://gist.github.com/1040456. Sorry if im asking to much but I dont really know where to look
[09:42:28] <Aamir> gym_jane: yes
[09:42:35] <gym_jane> cool
[09:42:36] <Kambfhase> fabiobik eddiemonge: i though your code was missing a }); but it is there.
[09:43:10] <eddiemonge> where?
[09:43:23] <phishbot> is it a bad idea to use jQuery Templates in a production project since tmpl itself is still in Beta?
[09:43:34] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: $('#register-active').attr('id', 'register');});
[09:44:13] <eddiemonge> now its there
[09:44:21] <fabiobik> Kambfhase ya its missing thanks
[09:44:25] <fabiobik> its working now
[09:45:47] <Tobsn> phishbot, well.. i use it and just now tested it in IE8 and its reporting it cant find $.tmpl
[09:45:57] <phishbot> lol
[09:46:09] <phishbot> Tobsn: that's funny and odd :(
[09:46:42] <eddiemonge> Tobsn: did you say if there is a live link?
[09:48:59] <Tobsn> yeah
[09:52:44] <Me-Selfe> Might be a stupid question, but i have added mousemove() to an object, but it takes resources to redraw it while moving.. Whats the common way to not draw it on every move event? Some timer or something?
[09:53:00] <eddiemonge> Tobsn: check your code at jshint.com
[09:54:58] <insign> what are wrong at e.currentTarget.find('.tS')
[09:54:59] <insign> ?
[09:55:28] <Kambfhase> $(e.currentTarget).find() << try this
[09:55:35] <dancannon> Ok instead of asking to look at my code could somebody point me to an article or tutorial showing an example of javascript that uses alot of events and/or jquery ui widgets?
[09:55:59] <eddiemonge> ben_alman: ping for dancannon
[09:56:32] <mhafren_> Hello, with ui tabs, why does the cookie get deleted if you replace the content where the tabs are using .html() function? And can you avoid this?
[09:56:42] <dancannon> eddiemonge: ?
[10:02:49] <bakers> I want to test if any input,select,textareas have focus(). Will this work? $("input,select,textarea:focus")
[10:03:20] <Kambfhase> no
[10:05:30] <kborchers> bakers i would try testing $("input,select,textarea").has(":focus").length
[10:06:13] <bakers> kborchers: I was doing that, but it doesn't seem to be working
[10:06:23] <Kambfhase> try .filter() instead of .has()
[10:06:57] <kborchers> also, :focus i think is only available in 1.6 or later
[10:08:29] <kborchers> bakers could also try $( document.activeElement ).is("input,select,textarea") - untested
[10:08:29] <Whirl3d> I need some help with a selector, please. I need to select the (.profile) after the (.profile) with .current....I can't quite get it.
[10:09:02] <Whirl3d> $(".profile").filter(".current").next() doesn't work because of the filter
[10:11:42] <Whirl3d> $(".profile").is($(".profile").filter(".current")).next()   ?
[10:13:13] <Kambfhase> $(".current.profile +. profile")
[10:14:06] <ohcibi> when i have a js-object which has a property prop, whats the difference between calling it with prop vs this.prop?
[10:14:10] <Whirl3d> for real? Kambfhase, thanks. I've never used that notation before.
[10:14:16] <bakers> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/fvqUv/ Testing for .has(":focus") doesn't seem to work
[10:15:02] <Kambfhase> Whirl3d: CSS Selectors for the win!
[10:17:14] <kborchers> bakers like Kambfhase said, use .filter() instead of .has(). that does work
[10:17:25] <Kambfhase> bakers: that doesn work, because the keydown event doesnt get to the window when focusing the input
[10:18:44] <bakers> kborchers: Kambfhase : Changing to filter did work, thanks
[10:18:46] <bakers> http://jsfiddle.net/fvqUv/1/
[10:23:21] <Whirl3d> Anybody got a link for the simplest thumbnail-esque index tutorial. I just need to have 1 "visible" element and the name of the next/prev elements displayed so you can cycle through them. It shouldn't be as hard as I am making it.
[10:23:26] <bamccaig> Hmmm, I'm attaching an object to an element with .data(), but it mysteriously stops working after a bit.
[10:23:40] <Efazati> is there any tutorial for avoid dirty code style in jquery
[10:23:53] <bamccaig> i.e., one at point, jQuery("#id").data("key") returns the instance, but shortly after it returns undefined. :-/
[10:23:58] <Kambfhase> ther is jshint and jquerylint
[10:26:06] <insign> Kambfhase, e.currentTarget has an element span.tS

[10:30:30] <eddiemonge> Efazati: yeah, dont write it like that
[10:30:47] <kborchers> t432 you can not post files that way. you might want to look at ?g jquery file upload plugins @ t432
[10:30:52] <eddiemonge> t432: file upload through ajax doesnt work
[10:31:31] <t432> can atleast get the name of the file?
[10:33:20] <insign> curious, $(e.currentTarget).find('.tS') works, but e.currentTarget.find('.tS') don't

[10:33:46] <Efazati> eddiemonge, there isn't any structure or suggestion ? like javascript mvc
[10:34:22] <eddiemonge> insign: its because you cant use jquery methods on something that isnt a jquery object
[10:34:45] <eddiemonge> Efazati: you could read the core coding guidelines if you want

[10:35:28] <salazr> #help - given this response:[one:two,session:{"session_key":"blah","uid":000000}] .. why is response.session.uid undefined?
[10:35:53] <salazr> (working within facebook.. that's the response to FB.ui method: oauth.. need to grab the uid
[10:36:03] <salazr> seems like the session object in the response is a string.. :?
[10:36:05] <salazr> :/
[10:36:21] <Kambfhase> thats not valid javascript
[10:36:36] <salazr> i know.. just trying to explain
[10:37:03] <eddiemonge> salazr: thats also not jquery.
[10:37:21] <David_Bradbury> I'm trying to repeatedly fire an animation while the mouse is over an arrow, is there a simpler way to do that than using a setInterval during the mouseover, and stopping it on mouse out?
[10:37:39] <salazr> eddiemonge & Kambfhase:are you talking about trying to grab the value like so: response.session.uid ??
[10:37:42] <David_Bradbury> Basically a carousel
[10:37:43] <Me-Selfe> Anyone know how to improve IE8's slow rendering(?) when using mousemove() to move an element?
[10:37:57] <jaequery> hi guys
[10:38:03] <jaequery> anyone here use SASS ?
[10:38:19] <David_Bradbury> #sass might :p
[10:38:28] <tbranyen> jaequery: yea
[10:38:32] <tbranyen> its neato
[10:38:44] <salazr> eddiemonge: Kambfhase this is damn valid: FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
[10:38:44] <salazr>   if (response.session) {
[10:38:44] <salazr>     alert(response.session.uid); } }); ...
[10:39:00] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: setTimeout calling itself with a flag to see if it should continue
[10:39:04] <salazr> not sure what you guys mean.. but thanks
[10:39:26] <Kambfhase> salazr: the code you pastesd above was invalid
[10:39:36] <eddiemonge> salazr: maybe but its not jquery. does that method actually parse the response as json into an object?
[10:39:43] <David_Bradbury> eddiemonge: Yeah, sounds like what I'll need to do. Was hoping there would be something like .mouseover that fires repeatedly when the mouse is over :)
[10:40:07] <salazr> eddiemonge: i was assuming it was coming off as an object.. turns out its not.. going to parse the json
[10:40:09] <salazr> thanks!
[10:40:22] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: no because that would be inefficient. theres mousemove but nothing if the mouse is just sitting
[10:40:40] <Reedyseth> David_Bradbury: have you tried with .mouseenter ??
[10:41:16] <Reedyseth> it helps a lot the .mouseenter event
[10:41:20] <David_Bradbury> eddiemonge: True - The problem is, when you set an animation to 20ms, and you fire it ever 20 or 21ms, sometimes the timer can get screwed up and not animate at all
[10:41:40] <David_Bradbury> Reedyseth: Well that will work for using the setInterval timer, but not for firing repeatedly
[10:42:25] <Reedyseth> David_Bradbury:  you are right, I got what you really want :p
[10:42:33] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: thats why i said a settimeout. you really should never be using setinterval
[10:42:54] <bamccaig> Hmmm, I think the problem might have been an unexpected ASP.NET <asp:UpdatePanel>. >:( Thanks anyway.
[10:43:14] <fabiobik>  $('#headlogincontent').effect("shake", { times:3 }, 300);	     whats wrong with this?
[10:43:51] <David_Bradbury> eddiemonge: Touche, I guess doing a settimeout call on itself would probably prevent that from happening

[10:46:45] <djquery> fabiobik: you do have jqueryui loaded dont u
[10:47:02] <fabiobik> djquery how to load id?
[10:47:07] <fabiobik> *it?
[10:47:14] <Kambfhase> djquery: dont make assumptions which might turn out wrong ;)
[10:47:19] <djquery> put a script reference
[10:47:36] <djquery> Kambfhase: well thats why I asked for a demo
[10:49:06] <Reedyseth> callate
[10:50:06] <fabiobik> djquery how to load that thing

[10:50:59] <mhafren_> Hello, with ui tabs, why does the cookie get deleted if you replace the content where the tabs are using .html() function? And can you avoid this?
[10:51:53] <fabiobik> djquery how to load ui
[10:52:13] <kborchers> fabiobik you need to include the jquery ui library http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.13/jquery-ui.min.js
[10:52:30] <djquery> fabiobik: are you saying you dont know how to include a script in your page/
[10:53:21] <insign> jquery has the event domready?
[10:53:24] <fabiobik> kborchers  what is the diference http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.js
[10:53:42] <fabiobik> i need to include 2?
[10:53:50] <kborchers> two different libraries. jquery vs jqueryui. yes both
[10:54:27] <djquery> fabiobik: well jquery is the lumber that you build the house with. jquery ui is all the stuff to make the house look pretty
[10:54:36] <consumerism> if the ajax request i'm making does not use either GET or POST variables, is there any reason i should choose one method over the other?
[10:54:59] <kborchers> djquery i like that analogy :)
[10:55:09] <fabiobik> it works thanks
[10:55:13] <djquery> kborchers: it was ajpianos

[10:55:43] <rrva_> I have a form submission with takes a bit of time. How to show a spinning wheel when the form is submitted which disappears when the submit result loads? (preferably no ajax submit if possible, but otherwise i'll use ajax)
[10:56:09] <Krambfhase> consumerism: "get" is short than "post" ;)
[10:57:32] <Axcy> Hello, do I ask questions about jquery validation here as well? In regards to forms?
[10:57:32] <eddiemonge> rrva_: the spinning loader is pointless when doing a normal submit
[10:57:50] <Krambfhase> Axcy: ask.
[10:58:05] <rrva_> eddiemonge: you mean since the browser already started "leaving the page" reading the http post response?
[10:58:07] <eddiemonge> consumerism: depends on the request. if its just getting data, then .get. if its sending data, then post
[10:58:18] <eddiemonge> rrva_: yes
[10:59:25] <djquery> rrva_: $('form').submit(function(e){  $(this).addClass('ajaxwait');  $.post(this.action, $(this).serializeArray(), function(){ $('form').removeClass('ajaxwait');}); });
[10:59:26] <systemfault> consumerism: I chose post when I intend to change something on the server.
[10:59:50] <Axcy> I have a form - Let's say two options A and B - I want to show some extra fields in case someone choses option A, but hidden if not
[10:59:50] <rrva_> djquery: nice
[10:59:52] <djquery> rrva_: or somethin like that
[11:00:03] <Axcy> How do I acomplish this with the jquery validation plugin?
[11:00:08] <systemfault> consumerism: There's actually more than GET and POST in the HTTP spec, unfortunately.. you can only access the other HTTP VERBS with ajax.
[11:00:11] <rrva_> I want a spinning wheel animation, cross browser
[11:00:11] <innociv> Oh shit..
[11:00:22] <djquery> rrva_: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[11:00:24] <innociv> ajpiano, are you around?
[11:00:51] <ajpiano> innociv: what's up
[11:01:01] <innociv> You were helping me with that extend thing yesturday, right?
[11:01:07] <innociv> I just ran into something crazy.
[11:01:14] <ajpiano> um, it rings a bell :p
[11:01:33] <jaequery> from purely visual standpoint, is there any difference between this and this ?   http://pastebin.com/XprGsD0U
[11:02:07] <jaequery> i pasted the code in the pastebin
[11:02:18] <jaequery> actually my entire question is written there
[11:03:00] <jaequery> my question is really, are they literraly the same?
[11:03:02] <ajpiano> no
[11:03:09] <ajpiano> one only happens when javascript is on
[11:03:14] <ajpiano> also they apply the styles differently
[11:03:20] <ajpiano> the first will add an inline style
[11:03:24] <ajpiano> the latter is just a rule in a stylesheet
[11:03:32] <ajpiano> so they could cascade differently
[11:03:45] <kborchers> Axcy don't do with validation plugin, when a is selected, use .show() or .toggle() to show the fields or .hide()/.toggle() to hide when not selected. then in validation plugin validate those new fields only if A is selected
[11:05:18] <innociv> sec
[11:06:15] <Axcy> kborchers: http://www.markinns.com/articles/full/displaying_a_from_field_depending_on_previous_question_using_jquery <- So that'd be a "bad" way of doing it?
[11:06:36] <Axcy> The thing is I'll have a lotta fields where this can happen, so having one central function for it would really be the best option
[11:06:43] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/25/ Okay weird, it's working fine here..
[11:06:44] <ravasthi> Hi, I had a question about building jQuery UI locally.
[11:06:48] <innociv> I'll have to put up a bigger example
[11:07:41] <ravasthi> I've got a slightly customized version of the autocomplete widget, and what I'd like to do is build a custom package a la ThemeRoller. Is that even possible from a git clone? Please advise.
[11:08:14] <kborchers> Axcy: no, that is pretty much exactly what i was saying to do. that doesn't even mention the validation plugin
[11:09:28] <SkyFlyer> anyone use .draggable ?  I'm dragging a div contained in another div.  But when I read the location (top and left) the top works fine and is contained and based of the Top, but left is based off another div and not the container div?  any one know why maybe?
[11:09:48] <Axcy> kborchers: But perhaps make it into a more general method and just send it Id's? Just so I don't have a lotta redudent code
[11:10:03] <kborchers> Axcy: exactly
[11:12:48] <gnarf> SkyFlyer: can you make an example of your issue on jsfiddle.net?
[11:14:55] <David_Bradbury> >> function wheel() {}; setInterval('wheel()', 100);
[11:15:09] <David_Bradbury> I'm doing something similar to that, but it is saying wheel isn't defined
[11:15:15] <David_Bradbury> When I call setInterval
[11:17:22] <David_Bradbury> Meh, just moved the function to the global instead of $(window).load and it works
[11:18:38] <David_Bradbury> whoops, meant to send that to ##javascript, not #jquery
[11:19:38] <gnarf> David_Bradbury: don't use string args to setInterval
[11:19:45] <gnarf> setInterval( wheel, 1000 ) should work fine
[11:20:03] <gnarf> you can pass functions to setInterval/setTimeout - in fact it is preferred
[11:20:10] <gnarf> also, see ?setInterval
[11:20:11] <bot-t> also, http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[11:20:14] <DynamicFail> is there any easy way to display the contents of a file (can be JSON file) with formating live a webpage
[11:20:53] <David_Bradbury> gnarf: Ah, kk. Whenever I removed the quotes it didn't like it, so I always kept them. Getting rid of the quotes and that parenths fixes that :)
[11:23:15] <insign> jquery has the an event 'domready'?
[11:24:15] <systemfault> .ready
[11:24:30] <insign> thanks
[11:26:38] <Reedyseth> insign: $(document).ready(function() { //your code here });
[11:27:05] <Reedyseth> this waits until del DOM is ready and then runs your code
[11:27:34] <DrBitch> hello
[11:28:14] <DrBitch> i'm using this: $('.sort select[name=order]').change(function() {
[11:28:37] <DrBitch> and then using $(this)
[11:28:44] <DrBitch> but I want the new selected item
[11:28:48] <DrBitch> how can i get it?=
[11:29:00] <DynamicFail> I currently have a bash script that is constantly writing to a file that contains information in a format where it is formated by ROWS. I would like to have this table displayed on my local apache2 server live and in a nice format... is there anyway to do this?
[11:30:54] <Reedyseth> DrBitch: you run your code for the select that you want just like you said, with this, $(this).youcodetorun
[11:31:58] <Reedyseth> inside the function of the change method
[11:32:10] <DrBitch> yeah, but I need the "value" attribute value for the NEW selected item
[11:32:29] <DrBitch> and with $(this) I just get the item which was changed
[11:32:31] <systemfault> DrBitch: $(this).val() doesn't workd?
[11:32:34] <Reedyseth> a ok
[11:32:37] <systemfault> Have you even tried?
[11:32:46] <DrBitch> of course systemfault>
[11:32:52] <Reedyseth> systemfault is right
[11:33:05] <DrBitch> but it's giving me the item that was changed
[11:33:10] <DrBitch> i need the new one
[11:33:16] <Reedyseth> by using only $(this) you are refering to the object
[11:33:17] <Whirl3d> What is the easiest way to determine if a plugin/script is already loaded?
[11:34:01] <DrBitch> Reedyseth: ok, so how can I get the value of the option tag which was selected before the select changed?
[11:34:06] <Reedyseth> if you want the attribute use: $(this).attr("nameOfAttribute");
[11:34:29] <DrBitch> yes, i'm using $(this).attr('value')
[11:35:00] <Reedyseth> well my guess will be to store the value in a variable and then play with it
[11:36:03] <Reedyseth> DrBitch: if you store the value in a variable you can compare the value later
[11:36:30] <DrBitch> ok sorry i'm retard, it's now working
[11:36:32] <DrBitch> :P
[11:36:35] <DrBitch> thank you both
[11:37:08] <DrBitch> the value html attribute is associated to the "select" tag, I though it was associated to its option tag :S
[11:37:47] <Reedyseth> you can save you value like this, var myOptionValue = $(this).attr('value');
[11:39:37] <kborchers> Whirl3d: if you wrap your code that uses the plugin in $(function() { ..... }); you know it's loaded before you try to use it
[11:46:51] <DynamicFail> I currently have a bash script that is constantly writing to a file that contains information in a format where it is formated by ROWS. I would like to have this table displayed on my local apache2 server live and in a nice format... is there anyway to do this?
[11:47:52] <Whirl3d> kborchers, thanks for the reply. I have a script that loads my content through ajax and on occasion, I want to be able to dynamically load a script if it's not already loaded..That's different than plugin authoring...
[11:48:44] <Whirl3d> I've got the adding a script part down--I just don't want to duplicate efforts if a script is already loaded
[11:49:07] <innociv> dynamic, sure.. but that's not a javascript question at all
[11:49:17] <innociv> that's what you do using a database interface
[11:49:42] <kasunLak> hi, I have a listview and and once a item is clicked click event is triggered. Is it possible to get the id of that list item from the event itself?
[11:49:50] <kborchers> oh, i see. hmm ... probably not the most efficient way but first thing that comes to mind is try to create an object with the plugin, if error, load lib and try again?
[11:50:34] <kborchers> kasunLak event.target
[11:52:33] <djquery> Whirl3d: have you looked at yepnope.js
[11:52:50] <Whirl3d> kborchers, that's how I am doing it now, I was just hoping for a more graceful approach...
[11:53:05] <Whirl3d> djquery, no I have not. I will check it out now.
[11:53:48] <djquery> Whirl3d: if($ && $.fn && $.fn.myplugin){ $.getScript('myurl.js');}
[11:53:55] <innociv> Check if a namespace the script usees exists?
[11:53:56] <gnarf> kborchers: easier to test the existance of the plugin function
[11:54:03] <innociv> ^
[11:54:08] <BlackAnt> good
[11:54:13] <gnarf> djquery: if ( jQuery && jQuery.fn.myPlugin )
[11:54:26] <SirFunk> shouldn't this work: $("input[name='first_name'], input[name='last_name'], input[name='phone'], input[name='phone2']").map(function(){return this.val()});
[11:54:29] <gnarf> if jQuery then jQuery.fn is pretty much safe :)
[11:54:32] <SirFunk> should return a lsit of the vals?
[11:54:43] <kasunLak> kborchers it's giving the target's id. not sure I am asking in the correct way. what I want is the clicked item's id itself
[11:54:59] <ajpiano> SirFunk $(this).val() and then you have to do a .get() after the map to get a Real Array
[11:55:11] <innociv> You don't need singlequotes do you, sirfunk?
[11:55:13] <BlackAnt> get[0]
[11:55:14] <gnarf> SirFunk: and its going to be in DOM order
[11:55:24] <gnarf> not in selector order
[11:55:28] <ravasthi> Anyone know if it's possible to build a partial package of jQuery UI from the git clone? Or can I only do it through the ThemeRoller?
[11:55:53] <SirFunk> hmm
[11:55:58] <gnarf> ravasthi: running ant in the build directory builds all the js/css
[11:55:59] <SkyFlyer> Im trying to get position of div based on parent?  any idea?
[11:56:12] <gnarf> ravasthi: you can include each component you need from there
[11:56:24] <kborchers> ?demo @ kasunLak
[11:56:24] <bot-t> kasunLak, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:56:36] <gnarf> ravasthi: but it wont actually build the dependancy download unless you use the package tool
[11:56:52] <levu> hi, i have problems with my plugin submission on jquery.com, is there someone i can contact? any mail address?
[11:56:53] <ravasthi> gnarf, I've been using ant deploy-release
[11:57:39] <ravasthi> what I want to do is build, e.g., a package that includes my modified version of a widget.
[11:57:54] <ravasthi> but nothing but it and its dependencies
[12:00:30] <BlackAnt> SkyFlyer what exactly?
[12:01:05] <kasunLak> kborchers sorry, I am not aware of that site. Can you please look at the pastie http://www.pastie.org/2112544
[12:01:11] <BlackAnt> what positon do you wana access? @ SkyFlyer
[12:01:46] <gnarf> ravasthi: you might need to make a custom build target for jquery-ui-custom.js
[12:01:58] <gnarf> ravasthi: that cats the ones you need
[12:02:04] <ravasthi> i see.
[12:02:31] <ravasthi> i was hoping i wouldn't have to modify build.xml, but oh well. thanks for your help!
[12:04:39] <kborchers> kasunLak: so what gets alerted, the element right? also, see ?alert
[12:04:40] <bot-t> kasunLak, Forget alert‚Äîuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browser‚Äôs built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:04:54] <SkyFlyer> i got it.  I needed to make the parent relative position. then i can get left of child based on parent.
[12:05:32] <SkyFlyer> now back to trying to figure out why the child element wont be contained inside the parent when I do .draggable
[12:05:39] <BlackAnt> ok
[12:07:14] <SirFunk> if i have a keypress event.. how do i let it only fire ever x seconds?
[12:07:14] <t432> is there anyway I could pass an array to a php script?
[12:07:42] <yacek19> hi
[12:07:47] <SkyFlyer> t4 what do you mean? pass array to php script?
[12:08:18] <systemfault> t432: You serialize it to JSON then send it
[12:08:24] <yacek19> i changed my div with $("#quantity_form").html('Some new content here');  Is it possile to restore this div to a pvious state?
[12:08:29] <yacek19> *previous
[12:08:32] <t432> I have an array within a js function that I would like to make it available to a particular script
[12:08:34] <BlackAnt> SkyFlyer you can PInvoke keybd_event
[12:08:51] <BlackAnt> t432 yeah
[12:08:52] <systemfault> yousef: No, you killed the info
[12:09:07] <BlackAnt> question is n't quite clear
[12:09:33] <BlackAnt> but datastring serializes data
[12:10:29] <BlackAnt> omg was that in C++?
[12:10:38] <BlackAnt> lol
[12:11:53] <systemfault> What?
[12:12:32] <Jakey> crazy
[12:12:55] <kasunLak>  kborchers[A] Yes, what is alerted is #toolList but what I am expecting is if it is first one 'site0', Am I missing something?
[12:13:35] <BlackAnt> :D
[12:14:06] <kasunLak> kborchers Yes, what is alerted is #toolList but what I am expecting is if it is first one 'site0', Am I missing something?
[12:16:44] <BlackAnt> SirFunk i only know how to do that using setTimeout('myfunc'("+key_count+")", .. )
[12:17:37] <kborchers> kasunLak: where would site0 come from? is that an attr, class? it needs to be associated with the element that is being clicked. if it's just the index in that siteIds array, you won't see that
[12:17:43] <Durl> Hi all, I'm reading up on plugin development and I'm finding the docs (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Defaults_and_Options) a little confusing. Under 'Defaults and Options' it suggests providing the 'options' argument to the plugin function.  But further down under 'Plugin Methods' it suggests passing the 'method' argument.  Which is it if you need both?
[12:18:24] <ajpiano> Durl: you can name it whatever you want, you'll have to check the type of the argument inside of the function to determine which course of action to take
[12:18:36] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/c72rB/1/  How do I get that scope of this.el in Topic.prototype.open = Topic.prototype.open.extend(function () {});? :x
[12:18:48] <Durl> ajpiano: thanks, I'll give that a try.
[12:20:35] <innociv> hm.
[12:20:44] <kasunLak> kborchers Yes it's index means it is the point I am missing. I am generating index dynamically while reading json feeds.
[12:20:49] <innociv> Well if I select the new Topic it makes i can get the el
[12:21:23] <innociv> But how can I have some class scope holding all that?  That'd seem ideal.
[12:24:46] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/c72rB/4/ How would I have the Board.prototype.open scope contain this.el from the above function?
[12:27:02] <kborchers> kasunLak: assuming those indexes are unique, you could just assign them to the element's id when you create it from the JSON, then in your listener you can get the id which in turn would refer to your array index. simplified example - http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/HQK5w/ make sense?
[12:27:59] <kborchers> kasunLak: you'll need to use firebug or your browser's console to see the output after you click
[12:29:58] <kasunLak> kborchers Got it! Thank a lot!
[12:31:49] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/c72rB/7/ How can I have that this.el scope carry over into the this scope for Board.prototype.open()?  I need to be able to get something created in Board = function() from all those functions attached to it.

[12:34:02] <rrva_> that was what I needed
[12:35:51] <innociv> http://mckoss.com/jscript/object.htm By this it LOOKS like what i'm doing is right. I don't understand.
[12:35:56] <innociv> under "Defining and Calling Methods in a Class"
[12:36:16] <andrewebdev> if I load a page via $.ajax() and that page contains javascript. Lets say I later run a function that reloads a new page, into the same container (replacing everything) that also contains javascript. Would that start to eat up my memory? Or will any javascript items be "cleaned up" when emptying the container?
[12:37:52] <SkyFlyer> not sure if this is correct but it seems that when I made an item resizable, it would remove the draggable from constraint of parent.  but if I made it draggable first, then did resizable, it would persist the draggable inside parent? strange. bug maybe?
[12:38:42] * BlackAnt bbl
[12:40:41] <initself> I'm using autocomplete, but I dont really want it to 'append' results to my input box.  I just want to be able to put the returned JSON data anywhere on my page.
[12:40:51] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/bgj9K/
[12:41:04] <innociv> It seems bieng in prototype scope  is what's fucking it up.  I don't get it

[12:44:33] <initself> I just don't understand where the data gets appended to the input box.
[12:44:37] <initself> Where does that happen?
[12:46:09] <zekeweeks> I've got a script at http://zeke.ws/kD5AYw which seems to be running my $('li.inactive a').click() function even after the script has removed the .inactive class- it runs inside $(document).ready()... is that why selectors apply to the CSS state at load time and don't recognize classes I've changed after page load? (Code: http://jsfiddle.net/CzR9h/ )
[12:46:44] <systemfault> zekeweeks: They're selectors.
[12:46:50] <systemfault> zekeweeks: It's a "one-time" thing.
[12:47:25] <systemfault> You select nodes in the DOM then .click adds a click event on every selected nodes

[12:51:07] <systemfault> zekeweeks: Take your time to understand how they work, it's your bread and butter :P
[12:53:28] <kborchers> initself so you just want to remove the data from autocomplete at some point so that it no longer autocompletes? or remove autocomplete all together? not sure i understand?

[13:06:03] <astropirate> *=
[13:06:28] <kborchers> insign you have to pass an actual function not a call to a function. what i sent you is the correct way
[13:06:42] <systemfault> insign: You're that noob?
[13:06:54] <systemfault> insign: .ready takes a function as argument...
[13:07:06] <sahilsk> astropirate: i got you logic. rest i'll do. :)
[13:07:22] <kborchers> be nice systemfault, we were all there at one point ;)
[13:07:32] <astropirate> speak for yourself
[13:07:38] <astropirate> i was born with jquery knowlage
[13:07:44] <systemfault> kborchers: Sure, but then.. since I'm special, I used something called "documentation"
[13:07:57] <kborchers> i'll give you that one

[13:08:58] <insign> systemfault, alert() is a function

[13:09:14] <djQuery> insign: its also a pain in the ass
[13:09:50] <insign> systemfault, function = function
[13:10:04] <systemfault> insign: Learn javascript.. don't embarrass yourself.
[13:10:22] <insign> kborchers, thanks, I already read the doc and make similar but dont works
[13:10:53] <kborchers> insign one last time, did you try what i sent you? that is how you do it.
[13:10:56] <astropirate> insign, make a http://jsfiddle.net  please  i can help you debug your problem
[13:10:56] <initself> how do i avoid writing stupid shit like this>?

[13:12:15] <nbari> hi all, I am using $.post and the retrived data is a json array the one contains something like ['id-test','1'] where id-test is an image the one I would like to move using the css my question is how to convert the id-test to an jquery element so i can later use something like $('#id-test')
[13:12:17] <systemfault> insign: $(document).ready(function() { alert('hello'); });
[13:12:23] <insign> $(document).ready(function(){alert('test')}); dont change nothing
[13:12:37] <systemfault> insign: Then you're doing something wrong.
[13:12:40] <insign> as I said, function = function
[13:12:46] <systemfault> If you say so.
[13:12:50] <insign> systemfault, I already know
[13:12:53] <astropirate> I say again... make a http://jsfiddle.net
[13:13:10] <nbari> currently I am trying with $('#'+data[0]).css{top:data[1]} but notworking
[13:13:15] <nbari> any idea
[13:13:26] <djQuery> insign: there is a difference between defining a function and calling a function.     alert(); is calling the alert function that was defined earlier
[13:13:32] <insign> astropirate, on jsfiddle is works
[13:13:34] <insign> $(document).ready(alert('test'));
[13:13:41] <insign> it
[13:14:07] <djQuery> insign: and by the way what you wrote is not gonna wait for ready to finish
[13:15:21] <insign> systemfault, I'm migrating from mootools to jquery . So do not call me noob if you do not know very well what is a function.
[13:15:45] <systemfault> Seriously... learn javascript.
[13:16:01] <systemfault> The fact that some functions "evals" string doesn't mean they're functions.
[13:16:13] <astropirate> I think he is just trolling
[13:16:17] <systemfault> Same.
[13:16:20] <Helix_> Hey guys, I have a quick question re: .ajaxComplete()
[13:16:21] <systemfault> Or just stupid.
[13:16:25] <kborchers> insign you say it works in jsfiddle. can we see it? link?
[13:16:35] <insign> $(document).ready(alert('test')); and $(document).ready(function(){alert('test')}); is the same thing
[13:16:44] <astropirate> lol
[13:16:49] <kborchers> wow
[13:17:02] <djQuery> insign: no they aren't
[13:17:07] <glen1> offtopic, does anyone know of something that allows users to post feedback publicly on your site but u can approve it first?
[13:17:26] <Helix_> wordpress
[13:17:28] <insign> kborchers, http://jsfiddle.net/jhWMV/
[13:17:41] <djQuery> the first passes the result of the allert to the ready. but since alert just returns a null u cant tell the difference
[13:17:51] <kborchers> that alerts before the dom is ready
[13:18:08] <djQuery> kborchers: ^^^+++^^^^
[13:18:12] <glen1> Helix_, its not worth installing the whole of wordpress for that. I got it Disqus :) could probably work
[13:18:16] <nbari> I notice that using a string instead of a int is ateringthe behavior of .css(left:"XX") so wondering how to convert string to intergers
[13:18:18] <nbari> any idea?
[13:18:19] <insign> kborchers, it works ondomready too
[13:18:40] <insign> kborchers, http://jsfiddle.net/UAgVG/

[13:19:20] <erichynds> explodes: $('div:visible') or $('div:hidden')
[13:19:20] <Helix_> so I'm working on an app, and calling jquery latest via code.jquery.com. The problem is, if the network is down, the entire app won't work. what would I do with .ajaxComplete() in order to have it check to see if the jquery lib's loaded, if not, load a local copy?
[13:19:30] <djQuery> insign: doing what u want and doing what u think it does are 2 different things
[13:19:44] <erichynds> Helix_: fall back to a local version
[13:20:00] * kborchers is thinking of a different way to explain this ... if possible
[13:20:26] <Helix_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-goo
[13:20:28] <Helix_> something like that
[13:20:29] <nbari> it is ok to call my elemnts using somethiing like $('#'+data[0]) ? where data[0] = 'id-test' or is there a better way to parse the array and get the elemtns
[13:20:29] <Helix_> ?
[13:20:44] <djQuery> insign: it would be easier to demonstrate with setTimeout(alert("fired early"), 5000);
[13:21:12] <kborchers> djQuery perfect! ^^^
[13:21:58] <djQuery> nbari: do that kinda stuff all the time

[13:30:46] <lacrymology> if that makes any sense at all..
[13:31:13] <lacrymology> I'm stopped on the line with the debugger, b seems to be a jquery object
[13:31:58] <heedly> kborchers: I have other keys that already bind to up/down/left and right
[13:32:19] <heedly> kborchers: and it gets confusing for users, that if you focus on that it only effects that.
[13:33:13] <kborchers> lacrymology without seeing your code, have you tried $(b).delegate
[13:34:44] <kborchers> heedly hmm, that's a tough one. you may have to override the event handlers for the keys. don't envy you there http://goo.gl/NTpb4
[13:35:59] <innociv> return false is supposed to end a function early, right?  Doesn't seem to work with my inherited classes.. ugh

[13:45:23] <initself> i can't tell

[13:45:40] <initself> (i didn't seem to work)
[13:45:49] <kborchers> no, it's a method
[13:45:59] * initself reads more closely.
[13:46:29] <kborchers> call it after creating the autocomplete and pass it the value in the autocompletes input
[13:48:07] <initself> oh, the search value, got it

When i include the jquery library in the header section of my site, another image gallery on the same site stops working :( Is there anything I can do to solve this problem? The error i get is "Error: $ is not a function : Line: 107" And line 107 has something like this
[13:57:06] <Guddu> if( ! $type($('gallery'))){return false}
[13:57:17] <initself> so i can save the result of autocomplete and maybe run the search method or not.
[13:57:18] <Guddu> Any help in this regard wouldbe highly appreciated.
[13:57:26] <initself> Is that syntax correct?
[13:57:43] <systemfault> Guddu: Do you use prototype/mootools or another lib?
[13:58:03] <kborchers> Guddu is jQuery already included for that other image gallery? or possibly that gallery is also using $?
[13:58:13] <Guddu> Thanks for the response.....Yes. mootools include is there for sure.
[13:58:26] <initself> it is.
[13:58:36] <Guddu> JQuery is used only for 1 gallery which i added yesterday and due to that other gallery stopped working.
[13:59:11] <systemfault> Guddu: Check for jQuery.noConflict();
[13:59:29] <Guddu> I added jQuery.noConflict(); but the error persists.
[13:59:33] <systemfault> Hmm
[14:00:10] <kborchers> initself that will work but only within the scope of bindAutoComplete. if you want to access myAutocomplete outside of bindAutoComplete, you'll need to define it outside and set it inside. make sense?
[14:00:32] <Guddu> The error that I saw was in Firefox error console....If i send you the website URL could you please have a look? Will help me a lot.

[14:10:05] <yacek19> hi
[14:10:45] <tuhoojabotti> Shouldn't bind function take any event like addEventListener?
[14:10:52] <systemfault> Guddu: jQuery.noConflict();<
[14:11:01] <systemfault> Guddu: jQuery.noConflict(); I mean.
[14:11:04] <yacek19> I am inside $("form#test").submit(function(e){    function, Why can't I access form field  like  $('#id_quantity').val()
[14:11:14] <yacek19> it just returns undefined
[14:11:30] <systemfault> tuhoojabotti: AFAIK, it does.
[14:11:33] <yacek19> outside function I can access it normally
[14:11:50] <tuhoojabotti> systemfault: I tried replacing the addEventListener with bind, but I don't get anything. :/
[14:11:51] <Guddu> Like this you mean   $.jQuery.noConflict();
[14:11:58] <Guddu> Or  jQuery.noConflict();
[14:12:06] <tuhoojabotti> /*document.addEventListener*/$.bind("webkitvisibilitychange", function () {
[14:12:08] <systemfault> Guddu: No no... Just jQuery.noConflict();

[14:12:29] <bot-t> yacek19, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:12:34] <systemfault> tuhoojabotti: Then jQuery doesn't support that :/
[14:12:40] <Guddu> Ok
[14:12:42] <Guddu> Like this
[14:12:42] <Guddu> <script type="text/javascript">

[14:15:20] <JoeCoolDesk> relly?
[14:15:26] <systemfault> JoeCoolDesk: Or create a new "html5ish" one by prefixing with data-
[14:15:34] <JoeCoolDesk> Maybe I'll do that
[14:15:39] <yacek19> then you click "do koszyka", select quantity, and then it is undefined
[14:15:47] <systemfault> Guddu: Checking.
[14:16:03] <Guddu> SystemFault : Thanks :-)
[14:16:13] <tuhoojabotti> Well it was worth checking out, if ya find a jQ way for that let me know. ;D
[14:16:40] <systemfault> Guddu: Try to use jQuery.noConflict(); JUST AFTER the line where you include jquery
[14:17:13] <LeaFlashDev> Hello does anyone has a jquery external file example with jquery function on i t
[14:17:15] <LeaFlashDev> ?
[14:17:50] <Guddu> Done. Reloading the page now.
[14:17:55] <systemfault> LeaFlashDev: Use jsfiddle.net
[14:18:03] <mikeric> systemfault: i tried using getJSON too, but this is what i've got atm. http://pastie.org/2113095
[14:18:41] <systemfault> mikeric: Looks like an empty object :/
[14:18:41] <Guddu> SystemFault: Awesome.....U shud be callled SystemRestore instead :-)
[14:18:45] <kborchers> yacek19 before you set quantita, you are overwriting the html in the form so that field doesn't exist anymore
[14:19:00] <systemfault> Guddu: :P
[14:19:28] <yacek19> kborchers: I see, do you know any simple solution?
[14:19:38] <kborchers> set quantita first
[14:20:33] <yacek19> kborchers: Jesus Christ thanks for help :)
[14:21:02] <kborchers> np, sometimes it's just right in front of you ;)
[14:21:41] <LeaFlashDev> systemfault: once my jquery function are created how can i call then from my html page
[14:21:47] <LeaFlashDev> I want to separate
[14:21:49] <LeaFlashDev> the code
[14:22:28] <systemfault> LeaFlashDev: I haven't understood the question at first...
[14:22:37] <Guddu> SystemFault : One Last Question. Could i use jQuery.noConflict(); and at the same time have my javascript come from a .js file instead of having to put the code in the header?
[14:22:43] <systemfault> LeaFlashDev: Just use a <script> tag?
[14:23:15] <LeaFlashDev> systemfault: for example on my html page i have a lot of function like this
[14:23:16] <LeaFlashDev> $(function() {
[14:23:17] <LeaFlashDev>     $('#test').delay(1000).fadeOut();
[14:23:17] <LeaFlashDev> });
[14:23:25] <LeaFlashDev> I want to separate them on an external file
[14:23:38] <systemfault> LeaFlashDev: Just move the code in a .js file then include that file in your html
[14:23:43] <systemfault> LeaFlashDev: It should work "as-is"
[14:24:08] <LeaFlashDev> include like this ?
[14:24:09] <LeaFlashDev> <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/jquery.portfolio.js"></script>
[14:24:16] <LeaFlashDev> I tried but doenst work
[14:24:55] <systemfault> Guddu: As long as the noConflict is just after including jQuery, it should be fine. Only one thing though... When you want to refer to jQuery, use the "jQuery" object, not the "$"
[14:25:00] <MoTiOnXml> how do i change the context of "this" to the action function here? sender.click(function(e) { action(this, e, data); });
[14:25:15] <MoTiOnXml> i've looked at jQuery.proxy but it looks like it doesn't support args
[14:25:22] <MoTiOnXml> or i'm blind tonight
[14:25:24] <systemfault> Guddu: If you really want the $, use a closure :   (function($) { your code here })(jQuery);
[14:25:26] <Aple> Hey guys, I'm trying to wrap my head around .ajax. Can anyone help me out? I'm just trying this basic test. Just trying to have user enter their first and last name, click submit, it sends it to process.php, then process.php concatenates the two $_POST vars, and index.php echo's the new variable: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417733/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417734/
[14:26:24] <Guddu> So will sometthing like this work as well?
[14:26:24] <Guddu> <script type="text/javascript">
[14:26:25] <Guddu> jQuery.noConflict();
[14:26:25] <Guddu> </script>
[14:26:25] <Guddu> <Include External .js file here>
[14:26:45] <systemfault> Guddu: Sure, if the plugin is well written
[14:27:04] <systemfault> Guddu: Well written plugins don't depend on the "$" symbol
[14:27:46] <MoTiOnXml> jQuery.proxy(action, this)(e, data); ?!
[14:28:02] <MoTiOnXml> or should i use apply()?
[14:29:12] <MoTiOnXml> yeah, that's it - thanks for nothing ;)
[14:29:57] <Aple> Anyone want to teach me AJAX for free?!
[14:30:09] <Aple> This is the worst free support I've ever gotten!
[14:30:17] <Aple> You're all fired!
[14:30:23] <Aple> :)
[14:30:23] <systemfault> MoTiOnXml: You could probably pass the this as event data
[14:30:57] <systemfault> MoTiOnXml: sender.click({myThis: this}, function(e) {});...
[14:32:10] <Aple> Hm............................
[14:32:11] <Guddu> SystemFault : Awesome. It works fine now.
[14:32:13] <Aple> I'm a girl!

[14:39:49] <JoeCoolDesk> HTML data sounds great
[14:40:08] <systemfault> :)
[14:40:26] <JoeCoolDesk> But how can I target a certain one?  Trying .data and .attr but there's I can't target a certain one
[14:40:41] <JoeCoolDesk> I mean attribute AND value
[14:40:50] <systemfault> JoeCoolDesk: Sorry, not sure what you mean...
[14:40:58] <systemfault> With a css selector?
[14:42:14] <JoeCoolDesk>  $(".tab").attr("data-id", activeTab).fadeIn();  Sets data-id to the var.  Doesn't select the data-id with the var
[14:42:36] <systemfault> JoeCoolDesk: http://jsfiddle.net/pLY7J/
[14:42:42] <systemfault> That?
[14:43:39] <JoeCoolDesk> Alright, how do you get a certain datalulz where it's hey, then?

[14:44:51] <JoeCoolDesk> http://jsfiddle.net/pLY7J/2/
[14:44:51] <muley> is there a way to tell if an iframe's document.location is protected (i.e. different domain than the parent). i get "Permission denied to access property 'pathname' now
[14:44:55] <systemfault> See, only one of the two divs has "hello"

[14:45:08] <JoeCoolDesk> Signed
[14:45:15] <muley> i understand why it's protected, but how do you test for tha?
[14:45:26] <systemfault> JoeCoolDesk: http://jsfiddle.net/pLY7J/3/
[14:45:32] <initself> I get NO errors from IE7.
[14:45:42] <initself> Data doesn't show.  IE8, fine.
[14:45:46] <systemfault> JoeCoolDesk: I hope it helped :)
[14:45:51] <initself> how the F do you debug that POS then?
[14:45:53] <innociv> muley, if you get permission denied then it's different ;p
[14:46:18] <muley> :D
[14:46:32] <muley> gotta be a better way than try-catch
[14:47:07] <systemfault> innociv: Run it on IE8 in IE7 mode
[14:47:21] <MoTiOnXml> systemfault: nope, using call instead
[14:47:31] <MoTiOnXml> action.call(this, { .. });
[14:47:33] <systemfault> MoTiOnXml: Ah, good :)
[14:47:44] <systemfault> MoTiOnXml: It's not really the same as proxy though..
[14:47:47] <muley> looks like i can maybe read document.location but not document.location.XXX
[14:47:54] <systemfault> .proxy returns a function with a bound "this"
[14:48:06] <systemfault> Anyway :P Later all :)
[14:48:45] <JoeCoolDesk> Thanks systemfault
[14:48:54] <JoeCoolDesk> Didn't get the ending bracket
[14:49:05] <JoeCoolDesk> And since this is JS it's IE compatible?
[14:50:00] <muley> nope. nevermind
[14:51:17] <Aple> How about this? Would anyone be up for making a really simple AJAX page in PHP? Like, it accepts a field of 2 and passes them through some PHP then returns them to the same page without the user ever knowing?
[14:51:29] <Aple> Not trying to steal this for a project or anything, just trying to see some really barebone examples
[14:51:35] <muley> innociv: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1292257/suppressing-permission-denied-errors-in-javascript
[14:51:42] <muley> yep. i'll make a function for it
[14:52:14] <innociv> Good thing javascript lets you write your own functions! :p  Don't have to worry about what it can't do.

[14:56:06] <initself> $('#products > tbody:last')
[14:56:17] <joshjs> thx, mates
[14:56:18] <djQuery> initself: and if you want to append text u should use .asspend not .text or .html they will overwrite
[14:56:37] <initself> djQuery: Thanks, man.  Just trying to figure out why IE7 won't append.
[14:56:46] <initself> it will do this: $('#test').html('test');
[14:56:53] <initself> it will not do this: $('#products > tbody:last').append('<tr><td>' + product.value + '</td><td>' + product.desc + '</td><td>' + product.vendor + '</td><td>' + product.irvine + '</td></tr>');
[14:57:24] <initself> what kind of syntax is the '>'?
[14:57:34] <initself> maybe it doesn't support that kind of css
[14:57:48] <djQuery> initself: #products>tbody).last() it prob has an issue with :last
[14:58:04] <djQuery> initself: ie6\7 suck at psuedo selectors
[14:58:07] <initself> so basically, i just want to put rows inside tbody
[14:58:13] <initself> i dont even care about last
[14:58:18] * initself tries without it.
[14:58:36] <initself> nope
[14:59:06] <insign> $($('#mm li').get()).each(function(i){}) is the shortest possible?
[14:59:16] <initself> djQuery: Any suggestions to avoid using last?

[15:00:36] <initself> i should know this!
[15:00:45] <djQuery> insign: and u just need $('#mm li').each(function(i, elm){});
[15:00:49] <initself> #products tbody is what I tried
[15:00:55] <initself> just tbody works
[15:01:35] <insign> djQuery, thanks
[15:01:48] <initself> IE7 doesn't like table#products > tbody

[15:58:00] <zim> Also. I have been thinking about a function that will collect data from all data-* tags in an element and turn them into an array
[16:00:20] <zim> ie. <div data-foo="bar" data-bar="foo"> will create an array with {"foo":"bar","bar":"foo"}
[16:00:54] <zim> is there somthing like this before I reinvent the wheel?
[16:01:00] <d4rklit3> jquery?
[16:01:03] <d4rklit3> lol

[16:02:39] <as1> Hi, I'm having a strange issue using jquery tabs, where each tab runs the same jquery scroller script inside of it. As I switch tabs, it gets faster and faster. Can anyone say what I'm doing wrong?
[16:03:03] <zim> Ty will give it a go
[16:03:13] <d4rklit3> sounds like its addign to scroll speed
[16:03:14] <d4rklit3> everytime
[16:03:23] <zim> asl are the tabs loading the script in via ajax?
[16:03:30] <as1> yes zim
[16:03:31] <d4rklit3> i dunno how it works in jquery, but whatever object you have as your scroller
[16:03:42] <d4rklit3> just clear it
[16:03:47] <d4rklit3> when the tab switches
[16:04:13] <zim> sound like they are running mutiple versions of the same script
[16:04:52] <trapecistak> THIS WORKS  ===>    $('#downloadEffect').animate({ opacity:'toggle', height:'toggle' }, 2500);
[16:05:08] <as1> I have a php index which loads ajax tabs, the tabs are php. I have to load the script each time in the tabs to make it run.
[16:05:15] <as1> I'm using mopSlider.
[16:05:16] <trapecistak> THIS DO NO WORK  ===>    $('#downloadEffect').animate({ opacity:1, height:1 }, 2500);
[16:05:25] <trapecistak> doesn't make sense at all
[16:05:26] <d4rklit3> how is scroll speed determined?
[16:05:37] <zim> asl try bind or live
[16:05:38] <pinktacobender> has anyone know how to embed a .datepicker() inside a modal .dialog()
[16:06:09] <as1> scroll speed is set in the jquery js file
[16:06:16] <d4rklit3> do you set it
[16:06:20] <d4rklit3> or does the script
[16:07:11] <insign> djQuery, I think I understand the difference, but could you explain?
[16:07:18] <as1> predetermined by the script
[16:07:36] <djQuery> not realy as I dont remember what we were talkin bout
[16:07:49] <iareJilles> guys whats wrong with this( too short for a pastebin )

[16:07:51] <iareJilles> }
[16:07:57] <iareJilles> it just doesn't work =(
[16:08:15] <insign> the difference between mouseover and mouseenter?
[16:08:16] <iareJilles> div #x wont become the content of do.php =(
[16:08:36] <iareJilles> insign mouse over you use for buttons and shit, and mouse enter for entire divs

[16:09:30] <snover> iareJilles: do not paste code in the channel.
[16:09:34] <zim> iareJilles: http://jsfiddle.net/ don't paste in the channel!
[16:09:36] <djQuery> ?mdoc mouseeneter
[16:09:38] <bot-t> djQuery, Couldn't find "mdoc mouseeneter" in jQuery Docs.
[16:10:01] <insign> iareJilles, for an menu element that are inside the element of the event mouseenter is better, correct?
[16:10:18] <insign> ?mdoc mouseenter
[16:10:19] <bot-t> insign, Couldn't find "mdoc mouseenter" in jQuery Docs.
[16:11:06] <snover> insign: mouseover fires every time a child element is moused over; mouseenter only fires when the element on which it is attached is moused over
[16:12:10] <as1> d4rklit3, can you explain what you meant by  clearing the jquery?
[16:12:24] <as1> I'm pretty green to this..
[16:12:49] <zim> asl just load the script before the tabs
[16:12:55] <zim> not in them
[16:13:08] <as1> I tried that, but it won't work that way
[16:13:20] <zim> why
[16:13:41] <as1> wish I knew, maybe because it's including the tabs as php?
[16:14:09] <zim> nope the html does not know how it was created
[16:14:38] <zim> http://jsfiddle.net/ an example
[16:14:45] <insign> in jquery, anyone know a similar function to do the same of .substitute of mootools? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2621170/has-any-method-like-substitute-of-mootools-in-jquery

[16:15:27] <snover> ?jsisjs @ insign
[16:15:28] <bot-t> insign, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.

[16:26:36] <innociv> I don't get how to make this work.. ugh.
[16:27:41] <innociv> if I do like var topic = topics[1];   I'd need to topic.__proto__.function(); and the this namespace doesn't work..
[16:28:04] <innociv> Or rather, "this" is function() and not the topic object
[16:28:58] <ColKurtz> variables defined inside a $(document).ready(function(){ }); are scoped inside that function right?
[16:29:05] <paul_irish> ya
[16:29:29] <innociv> Yes, so other files will have to dom ready to access it.
[16:29:35] <djQuery> ColKurtz: as long as they are defined with var a =
[16:29:50] <djQuery> if you just do a= then its still global
[16:30:19] <snover> innociv: you might want to just save yourself the heartache and look at dojo.declare
[16:30:32] <innociv> And use the dojo framework?..
[16:30:49] <innociv> multiple frameworks is headache too
[16:32:06] <abjorn> :o
[16:32:18] <snover> innociv: or mootools Class
[16:32:19] <abjorn> whyohwhy must bot-t be gone :<
[16:32:30] <snover> bot-t: are you gone?
[16:32:31] <bot-t> snover, Outlook good.
[16:32:43] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[16:32:44] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[16:32:46] <innociv> But does mootools class allow for extending the parent/super?
[16:32:59] <innociv> And extend all children in effect?
[16:33:10] <innociv> I'm looking for extension, not inheritance.
[16:33:57] <innociv> And I really don't like the idea of two frameworks..
[16:34:01] <snover> innociv: I don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs supposed to mean
[16:34:30] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/h6vrx/
[16:34:44] <snover> innociv: if the tools you are using don‚Äôt do what you need them to do‚Ä¶find the right tools for the job
[16:34:56] <innociv> That, but I'm either having issue with functions in the object or the scope of the object
[16:35:06] <ColKurtz> you can't call $(window).load() inside a doc.ready()?
[16:35:20] <glen1> ./j #c
[16:35:41] <innociv> :/ Well I'd like to have a little code just to handle what i need instead of a whole framework
[16:35:47] <insign> jquery any function that remove trailing space from an element?
[16:36:00] <snover> innociv: you are using 100% of jquery?
[16:36:11] <coldhead> ?trim @ insign
[16:36:11] <bot-t> insign, jQuery.trim(): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[16:36:13] <innociv> No, but still
[16:36:24] <snover> but still what?
[16:36:25] <insign> coldhead, thanks
[16:36:51] <innociv> Ugh
[16:37:14] <innociv> This issue seems to mostly come down from needing to add these functions onto prototype for the extend to work
[16:37:19] <innociv> which is breaking scope
[16:37:37] <innociv> Board.function() scope works fine
[16:37:39] <joikus> you guys
[16:38:06] <innociv> oh wait
[16:38:08] <innociv> I think I got it..
[16:38:16] <joikus> im trying to embed some stuff to a clients website, using <script src="http://www.joikus.com/fx.js"></script>  which works fine
[16:38:28] <innociv> I needed to just call topic.function() :/
[16:38:38] <innociv> no .prototype or .__proto__...
[16:38:52] <joikus> but now i want to add a guid like, http://www.joikus.com/fx.js?abc   is there a way to retrieve the abc inside fx.js?
[16:39:03] <snover> innociv: if you don‚Äôt understand what you are doing you really ought to look at how other people do it, and/or just use their code
[16:39:19] <innociv> I have been looking all around..
[16:39:24] <innociv> I got it working this far :|
[16:39:42] <innociv> I've been reading a bunch of object oriented pages.
[16:39:54] <innociv> The whole prototype thing has been confusing
[16:40:00] <insign> anyone know how XPath works?
[16:40:05] <ColKurtz> why does having an alert() mysteriuosly make things work
[16:40:13] <ColKurtz> perhaps setting a timeout would accomplish the same thing?
[16:43:34] <joikus> :/
[16:55:15] <insign> on an event, $(e).$('li a') probably are wrong, how can I do this?
[16:55:55] <djQuery> insign: using more $ wont get you paid more
[16:56:03] <djQuery> is e an object/
[16:56:04] <djQuery> ?
[16:56:45] <insign> djQuery, e comes from the 'each'
[16:56:50] <insign> element
[16:57:02] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ insign
[16:57:02] <bot-t> insign, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:57:12] <djQuery> you know you have access to this in that each as well.
[16:57:41] <insign> ryanneufeld, one line code is not permited?
[16:57:56] <ryanneufeld> one line of code out of context is completely usesless
[16:58:02] <djQuery> $('ul').each(function(){   $(this).find('li a').whatever(;});
[16:58:26] <insign> djQuery, thanks
[16:58:48] <insign> djQuery, and if have two childs 'li a'?
[16:59:36] <djQuery> insign: although my example is completly worthless and schould be done as just $('ul li a').whatever() to accomplish the same thing
[16:59:47] <insign> ok
[16:59:52] <insign> thanks for the help
[17:00:19] <djQuery> insign: in css what happens to ul li a {background-color: green;}
[17:00:58] <ryanneufeld> djQuery: your second example is WAAAY slower than .find()
[17:01:20] <joikus> is there a way to prevent the following situation..  a js file has var joikus = 1234;
[17:01:26] <joikus> another js file has that same thing
[17:01:32] <joikus> can I check if joikus var was defined, else and only then define it?
[17:02:08] <djQuery> ryanneufeld: yes its a bad selector but depending on what he is doing an .chain might be better than an each then declare vars again etc..
[17:05:19] <ryanneufeld> oh wow
[17:05:22] <ryanneufeld> that's so not even right
[17:05:51] <ryanneufeld> $('ul').find('li a').each(function(){ //dowhatever()});
[17:06:20] <ryanneufeld> if you want all the a's in the UL
[17:06:25] <ryanneufeld> you don't even need the li in the find()
[17:06:28] <Renegade001> Actually, $('ul').children('li a') is faster
[17:06:28] <djQuery> ryanneufeld: and if dowhatever is written like a plugin? just drop the each
[17:06:34] <innociv> I've never thought selector speed to be a problem compared to $.each and such
[17:06:47] <djQuery> unless ur going for nested as well
[17:07:13] <djQuery> innociv: especialy the psudeo selectors like :last etc..
[17:07:50] <innociv> All the selectors are so fast, it's a non-issue even on mobile.
[17:08:20] <insign> i think that $('#mm li a').trim() are wrong but is possilble remove the trailing space without use an each?
[17:08:20] <ryanneufeld> innociv: you're so mistaken
[17:08:27] <innociv> Really?...
[17:08:47] <ryanneufeld> rly
[17:08:47] <ryanneufeld> http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child/5
[17:09:06] <ryanneufeld> depending on the selector, you could be causing a lot more work for the mobile device
[17:09:06] <innociv> Um
[17:09:18] <innociv> You misinterpreted me.
[17:09:27] <innociv> I didn't say some aren't slower than others; I didn't say that at all.
[17:09:33] <insign> djQuery, have you an ideia?
[17:09:41] <innociv> I said even the slowest selectors are so fast that it's a non-issue even on mobile
[17:09:48] <ryanneufeld> innociv: you said
[17:09:52] <ryanneufeld> "All the selectors are so fast, it's a non-issue even on mobile"
[17:10:12] <innociv> Yes.
[17:10:13] <innociv> Same thing
[17:10:15] <innociv> As what I just said
[17:10:21] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:10:27] <ryanneufeld> very different
[17:10:32] <innociv> That slice is doing 5k a second for me in what you linked.  My computer is 5 years old.
[17:10:35] <insign> I think that $('#mm li a').trim() are wrong but is possilble remove the trailing space without use an each?
[17:12:25] <ryanneufeld> innociv: a better test http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-selector-lookup/2
[17:12:32] <innociv> even that nth-child is 1.6k a sec.  Even if you saya mobile device is 1/100th the power of my 5 year old pc, a 62ms processing on a selector is sitll fast enough. :|
[17:12:38] <ryanneufeld> context and .find are faster than the selector engine
[17:13:01] <innociv> Kay.  Good thing I cache selectors and use .find all the time then.
[17:13:11] <ryanneufeld> Me too
[17:13:18] <ryanneufeld> that jsperf is why
[17:13:25] <ryanneufeld> when ever I'm unsure about two methods
[17:13:33] <ryanneufeld> I check there, and test if I can't find it
[17:13:38] <innociv> that .parent .find-me is still 26k to the 28k of the find....
[17:14:05] <ryanneufeld> look at the logged results though
[17:14:17] <innociv> whao way faster on chrome
[17:14:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:14:36] <innociv> on the .find() only
[17:14:43] <imsky> hola #jquery, como estas
[17:14:56] <ryanneufeld> find and context are pretty close in performance
[17:14:59] <innociv> But anyways, it really isnt' something you need to consider much compared to caching, use of loops, $.each.
[17:15:11] <ryanneufeld> exactly
[17:15:30] <ryanneufeld> unless you know the dom is gonna change, there is no reason to re-run the selector
[17:17:37] <supertrue> Can someone tell me what I am doing incorrectly in the single line of code where I invoke this textfill plugin?: http://jsfiddle.net/supertrue/TYvzr/2/
[17:17:43] <innociv> cachedLists[1] = $('<li id="li_1"></li>').html('<a>foo</a>').appendTo('ul');  cachedLists[1].find('a'); I'm pretty sure is faster than $('#li_1').find('a');
[17:21:16] <lathan> ?hey
[17:21:17] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[17:21:35] <lathan> hey coldhead, what's up?
[17:22:15] <coldhead> not much lathan, what's up with you
[17:22:44] <lathan> if its not school, its work, not work, its watching tv shows.......
[17:22:53] <lathan> or helping out in #jQuery
[17:22:54] <lathan> :)
[17:23:11] <lathan> it has been a while (before 3 days ago)
[17:23:16] <lathan> ?anyone
[17:23:16] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[17:25:05] <imsky> wut
[17:25:27] <lathan> what?
[17:25:38] <coldhead> ?hey @ imsky
[17:25:38] <bot-t> Hey imsky
[17:25:40] <lathan> that's just a greeting to ask for questions.......
[17:25:55] <lathan> maybee a little overkill.....
[17:28:39] <imsky> lol
[17:28:41] <imsky> hey coldhead
[17:29:46] <weedle> hey guys, can someone give me hand please, I want to show/hide something bassed on wether its ccs visabily equals hidden or not
[17:29:50] <weedle> is this possible
[17:29:59] <weedle> <img id=imgTuring name=imgTuring style='visibility:hidden'>
[17:30:16] <lathan> ?:visible @ weedle
[17:30:16] <bot-t> weedle, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[17:30:28] <lathan> .is(':visible') will check css visibility
[17:30:54] <weedle> of wow cool :) cheers
[17:30:57] <weedle> *oh
[17:31:06] <weedle> thanks heaps :)
[17:31:59] <lathan> weedle, you probably actually want toggle, see ?toggle
[17:32:00] <bot-t> weedle, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[17:32:23] <lathan> .toggle() will show if its hidden, and hide if its shown @ weedle
[17:33:02] <weedle> cool, so basicly, I have a field that appears if you click a button, I want a text box to be hidden if the captcha image is hidden, but show if its show
[17:33:08] <weedle> is that what toggle will do for me?
[17:33:25] <lathan> weedle, no, its actually the opposite....
[17:33:51] <lathan> weedle, but you can do .toggle(true) to show and .toggle(false) to hide
[17:33:55] <lathan> os .show() or .hide()
[17:34:00] <lathan> based on .is(':visible')
[17:34:26] <lathan> ?toggle( ShowOrHide )
[17:34:28] <bot-t> lathan, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[17:34:36] <lathan> ?toggle ( true)
[17:34:36] <bot-t> lathan, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[17:41:14] <ColKurtz> AW PRAISE THE LAWDS
[17:41:43] <lathan> huh @ ColKurtz
[17:42:02] <ColKurtz> i spent about 2 hours trying to figure out why soundmanager 2 wasn't workign when loaded with yepnope
[17:42:22] <ColKurtz> before I finally found the "lazy loading / deferred loading" part of the documentation and figured it out
[17:43:19] <abjorn> hm, 5.1 speakers...or a 24" monitor thats on sale for $160. Choices, choices
[17:44:32] <lathan> very difficult
[17:44:36] <lathan> I'd go for the monitor.....
[17:46:00] <abjorn> hmm, yeah, since it's on sale and the speakers aren't
[17:47:21] <abjorn> $160, though, for 24" 5ms, 300 cd/m2, 80,000:1 is a pretty darn good deal
[17:48:29] <imsky> wot is this
[17:48:55] <abjorn> imsky mah wiggla
[17:49:02] * imsky wigglahs
[17:49:07] * abjorn wigglez
[17:49:12] <imsky> my friend let me tell you something
[17:49:24] <imsky> size in a panel is a secondary concern to what kind of panel it is
[17:49:26] <imsky> IPS > TN
[17:49:56] <imsky> there's a reason apple puts them in their crap
[17:50:58] <joikus> you guys
[17:51:03] <abjorn> I don't really know what that means imsky
[17:51:06] <joikus> whats the right way to minify your js?
[17:51:16] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.pchardwarehelp.com/guides/lcd-panel-types.php
[17:51:20] <joikus> is it always a manual approach
[17:51:23] <imsky> joikus: using a js minifier
[17:51:25] <abjorn> there's isn't exactly a *right* way, joikus, but I use closure
[17:51:27] <imsky> ?js-min @ joikus
[17:51:28] <bot-t> joikus, Downloading jQuery - The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Development mailing list... http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[17:51:32] <imsky> goddammit
[17:51:35] <imsky> ?g js-min @ joikus
[17:51:36] <bot-t> joikus, JSMIN, The JavaScript Minifier - http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html
[17:51:59] <imsky> ?g closure compiler @ joikus
[17:52:00] <bot-t> joikus, Closure Compiler - Google Code - http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/
[17:52:04] <abjorn> Well, imsky, im not sure what this is: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=24-009-297&SortField=0&SummaryType=0&Pagesize=10&PurchaseMark=&SelectedRating=-1&VideoOnlyMark=False&VendorMark=&IsFeedbackTab=true&Page=2#scrollFullInfo
[17:52:10] <abjorn> wow thats a long link
[17:52:22] <imsky> if it's $160 for a 24", chances are it's a TN
[17:52:31] <abjorn> well, good ratings
[17:52:42] <abjorn> yeah, TN
[17:52:44] <imsky> Panel    TN
[17:52:55] <imsky> yarr
[17:53:04] <imsky> if you're planning to game on it, then i think that's a good deal
[17:53:12] <ColKurtz> 24" montior for $160 is a piece of shit
[17:53:20] <joikus> hmmm
[17:53:24] <ColKurtz> if you don't mind staring at a giant piece of shit all day then go for it
[17:53:28] <imsky> lol
[17:53:33] <ColKurtz> Personally, I have to have an IPS
[17:53:37] <abjorn> o.o got good ratings dawg
[17:53:43] <abjorn> also it's acer and they make pretty good stuff
[17:53:44] <ColKurtz> and a standard gamut IPS at that
[17:53:48] <ColKurtz> don't get a wide gamut
[17:53:50] <joikus> imsky, im in the asp.net world, using IIS etc.. what do you suggest during deployment
[17:53:52] <ColKurtz> it fucks everything up
[17:53:56] <ColKurtz> oversaturates all the colors
[17:54:30] <imsky> joikus: during deployment? there's some stuff there, i think. i'm not on a ms stack, but you can look at something...
[17:54:36] <imsky> joikus: here's the closure compiler, http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[17:54:53] <imsky> abjorn: it's got good ratings because people usually don't care about the difference
[17:55:03] <imsky> so to them it's a great deal, but they deal with 6-bit colors and crap
[17:55:25] <imsky> TN panels are great if you don't do anything graphics-related
[17:55:51] <joikus> hmm
[17:57:03] <ColKurtz> not necessarily if you do graphics-related work
[17:57:13] <ColKurtz> it's more like if you have a discerning taste for high quality screens
[17:57:25] <imsky> ok that's the apple argument
[17:57:35] <imsky> being an lcd panel connoisseur is kinda ridiculous
[17:57:37] <ColKurtz> if you don't notice that it's a giant piece of crap then that's fine
[17:57:42] <ColKurtz> lol no it's not
[17:57:45] <ColKurtz> i do web dev
[17:57:53] <ColKurtz> but i would HATE to work on anything other than an IPS
[17:58:09] <imsky> are you on a mac?
[17:58:15] <ColKurtz> i do have a mbp at home
[17:58:22] <imsky> ah well, thanks for confirming your zealotry
[17:58:23] <ColKurtz> i'm on a PC here at work, with an IPS screen
[17:58:26] <abjorn> that goes in the same category as being a hardcore audiophile lol
[17:58:28] <imsky> pragmatism ftw
[17:58:37] <abjorn> lolol
[17:58:40] <imsky> abjorn: what are you getting the monitor for? i guess i got ahead of myself
[17:58:43] <abjorn> well, I'm fine with TN
[17:58:47] <abjorn> my home computer
[17:58:49] <ColKurtz> what zealotry?
[17:58:56] <lathan> I hate design, maybe a little colorblind....(but aren't a lot of men?)
[17:58:56] <imsky> abjorn: i mean like...games or videos
[17:59:02] <abjorn> I'm not a designer or anything so I don't see why I should be concerned
[17:59:08] <imsky> yeah, then go for it
[17:59:08] <abjorn> games, programming, browsing
[17:59:09] <ColKurtz> then go for it
[17:59:10] <imsky> that's a killer deal
[17:59:18] <abjorn> word dawg
[17:59:22] <abjorn> GOT DA THUMBS UP
[17:59:26] <imsky> lol
[17:59:29] <imsky> YOU ARE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF
[17:59:34] <ColKurtz> For some people it bothers them, but if it doesn't then enjoy the deal
[18:00:11] <ColKurtz> i fucked up and bought a 27" IPS _wide gamut_ monitor for my home office
[18:00:14] <ColKurtz> :|
[18:00:15] <abjorn> To be fair, I am a bit of an audiophile. But I'm also poor so I don't seem like it, I always have shitty mid-range headphones lol
[18:00:17] <ColKurtz> :V
[18:00:28] <imsky> abjorn: headphones are kinda...non-audiophile, bruv
[18:00:30] <ColKurtz> the problem is the wide gamut
[18:00:36] <imsky> studio monitors or actual bigass speakers ftw
[18:00:51] <imsky> if you're supa rich, then you get a listening room
[18:00:59] <abjorn> imsky: nottin wrong wit headphones if you get the right ones
[18:01:13] <imsky> big difference when listening ;)
[18:01:14] <abjorn> I just have refurbished sony noise-cancelling headphones lol
[18:01:15] <abjorn> not very good
[18:01:18] <abjorn> well obviously
[18:01:26] <imsky> let me fire up my power amp here
[18:01:28] <abjorn> I'm going to get some new speakers next paycheck
[18:01:30] * imsky cranks up the choons
[18:01:56] <imsky> oh damn it's that portishead
[18:02:04] <abjorn> free 3 day shipping on this monitor, sweet
[18:02:13] <imsky> yeah dude newegg has killer retail terms
[18:02:19] <abjorn> god I know
[18:02:21] <abjorn> newegg is the best
[18:02:24] <abjorn> I get all my shit there
[18:02:29] <imsky> just don't build your pc all there lolol
[18:02:45] <abjorn> Well, I get a lot of my pc stuff from local stores, yeh
[18:02:50] <imsky> yeap good man
[18:02:56] <ColKurtz> landlord kicked us out
[18:03:03] <abjorn> except for the stuff that's more than $20 cheaper on newegg
[18:03:07] <abjorn> which is...surprisingly a lot

[18:16:03] <imsky> though i did like "drive"
[18:16:08] <abjorn> yeah thats a good song
[18:16:10] <imsky> incubus is actually a pretty decent band
[18:16:14] <abjorn> yeah
[18:16:16] <abjorn> I mean im not a big fan
[18:16:18] <imsky> there are tons more bands with crappier work
[18:16:21] <abjorn> haha
[18:16:22] <imsky> that are more popular
[18:16:28] <abjorn> yeah thats for sure >.>
[18:16:38] <abjorn> there are pleeenty of really shitty alt rock bands
[18:16:39] <imsky> but come on bruv
[18:16:47] <imsky> "rough and tough" is a sweet jam
[18:16:54] <abjorn> haha
[18:17:07] <imsky> that mid-90s sound always gets me
[18:17:10] <abjorn> all that kind of music isn't stuff I necessarily listen to but it's not the kind of thing I dislike
[18:17:37] <imsky> hmm i wonder if that's what the bros who "like" dubstep feel about dubstep
[18:17:43] <abjorn> lol
[18:17:46] <abjorn> fuck dubstep
[18:17:49] <imsky> hay hay
[18:17:52] <imsky> there are some good songs
[18:17:54] <abjorn> NO YOU HAY
[18:18:12] <imsky> gimme my space, i moonwalk like michael jackson
[18:18:12] <abjorn> i do not like dubstep
[18:18:16] <imsky> aw come on bruv
[18:18:22] <imsky> it's closer to metal than hip-hop lol
[18:18:31] <abjorn> psh means nothing to me
[18:18:35] <abjorn> also i like hip hop
[18:18:37] <imsky> hmm really?
[18:18:40] <abjorn> yeah
[18:18:45] <abjorn> i mean, mostly old school stuff
[18:18:51] <abjorn> can't go wrong with some public enemy or run dmc
[18:18:56] <abjorn> or nwa lol
[18:19:01] <abjorn> FUK DA POLICE
[18:19:05] <imsky> ...yeah that's the old school metal-oriented rap
[18:19:12] <imsky> like all of those people did metal songs
[18:19:14] <abjorn> metal-oriented? dunno about that lol
[18:19:18] <imsky> ...lol
[18:19:23] <abjorn> it's not metal oriented
[18:19:27] <imsky> anyway, here's a dece dubstep track, try it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwG4uNbvsyk
[18:19:29] <abjorn> it just has the same...
[18:19:31] <abjorn> attitude
[18:19:40] <abjorn> hence why they did crossover songs
[18:19:43] <abjorn> like public enemy and anthrax
[18:19:47] <imsky> right that's what i'm saying
[18:19:50] <imsky> harsh, loud sound
[18:19:55] <imsky> that's totally dubstep
[18:20:12] <imsky> except with beat drops lolol

[18:22:13] <lathan> so I take it this has turned to life issues and youtube videos instead of jQuery questions? :)
[18:22:19] <imsky> oh come on really?
[18:22:22] <abjorn> well no one is asking any lol
[18:22:23] <imsky> it's totally diff than the 16bit track

[18:25:39] <abjorn> word
[18:26:08] <imsky> plus
[18:26:13] <imsky> that song has a mobb deep sample
[18:26:19] <imsky> how you gon NOT MOBB DEEP
[18:26:26] <imsky> i mobb so deep, i'm steep
[18:30:45] <imsky> derp
[18:32:26] <josephpagoda> hello everyone.  I'm trying to use http://plugins.jquery.com/project/tab-slide-out on http://brushdragon.pagodabox.com .  The animation seems to work, except for some reason, I never get a handle button.  Anyone have any ideas why?
[18:35:28] <imsky> josephpagoda: i don't see anything on that site
[18:35:55] <josephpagoda> that's the point... there should be a button on the left hand side that says "contact" and clicking it should slide out the thumbnails
[18:36:04] <josephpagoda> (since I am using the same image from the example)
[18:36:48] <imsky> that's got to be the worst usability pattern ever
[18:37:04] <josephpagoda> (it's just me experimenting on how to get the slider working...)
[18:37:14] <imsky> (ok)
[18:37:17] <josephpagoda> (the final site won't be like that)
[18:37:20] <josephpagoda> :-P
[18:37:23] <imsky> hmm
[18:37:37] <imsky> well i don't see a button in the DOM
[18:37:41] <josephpagoda> yeah
[18:37:44] <imsky> so...make one
[18:37:47] <josephpagoda> it supposadely gets added by the plugin
[18:38:02] <imsky> jquery plugins are basically russian roulette for programming
[18:38:13] <imsky> we need six sigma for jquery plugins
[18:38:25] <imsky> because there's a ton of them out there, and most of them are defective
[18:39:03] <josephpagoda> this one was referenced on the actual jquery site... which is why I figured i'd try it out
[18:39:35] <imsky> most plugins are referenced on that site
[18:39:41] <imsky> especially the broken ones
[18:40:46] <josephpagoda> hmmm
[18:40:55] <imsky> ok
[18:40:56] <imsky> first off
[18:41:01] <imsky> you don't have a .handle element
[18:41:13] <josephpagoda> according to the instructions, I'm not supposed to
[18:41:23] <josephpagoda> and looking at the working example, it doesn't have one
[18:41:36] <imsky> tabHandle: '.handle',                     //class of the element that will become your tab
[18:41:38] <josephpagoda> (until the jquery is fired)
[18:41:41] <josephpagoda> yes
[18:41:47] <josephpagoda> the jquery fires and adds that
[18:41:58] <imsky> wut
[18:42:00] <josephpagoda> and then you can style it using css if desired
[18:42:04] <josephpagoda> (from what i've seen/read)
[18:42:07] <imsky> lol this is all kinds of fail
[18:42:21] <imsky> all this plugin supposedly does is move a div offscreen to onscreen after you click on something
[18:42:33] <imsky> you can do this with a couple of .animate calls...
[18:42:36] <imsky> why go through this trouble?
[18:42:47] <josephpagoda> education
[18:43:02] <josephpagoda> i'm trying to learn better how plugins work and such
[18:43:06] <imsky> yeah this is like someone telling you how to tie your shoes with his "shoe-tier 2000 XXL"
[18:43:12] <imsky> only 20 steps of configuration!
[18:43:16] <p1und3r> lol
[18:43:40] <imsky> trust me on this, most plugins are written by people who just discovered how to make plugins
[18:43:46] <imsky> this is better done with actual jquery..
[18:43:49] <imsky> it's not complex at all
[18:44:13] <josephpagoda> so you propose I just make some .animate calls and see what happens?
[18:44:18] <imsky> yes
[18:44:52] <p1und3r> imsky how do you feel about lavaLamp and cycle
[18:45:03] <imsky> p1und3r: i don't even know what that is
[18:45:03] <josephpagoda> and just since you deserve to see more of what i'm going for
[18:45:12] <josephpagoda> let me redeploy this before i tried to do the animation
[18:45:35] <p1und3r> imsky: some nifty jquery plugins im playing with :p they seemed pretty popular
[18:45:39] <coldhead> lavalamp is okay, it can be a little tricky to make it work
[18:45:48] <coldhead> cycle is popular, imsky knows that
[18:46:14] <p1und3r> im trying to combine them :o its looking kinda hacky
[18:46:19] <imsky> hmm yeah cycle is pretty dece
[18:46:26] <imsky> though i can't say i use it all that much these days
[18:46:28] <coldhead> you want the lavalamp INSIDE cycle?
[18:46:42] <p1und3r> im trying to make the lavalamp follow the activeSelected
[18:46:48] <p1und3r> in the cycle pager
[18:46:54] <coldhead> oh okay
[18:46:57] <coldhead> that should be possible
[18:47:12] <p1und3r> so far i've only been able to get it working with .mouseenter .click .mouseleave
[18:47:17] <imsky> 0_o
[18:47:29] <imsky> so i checked out lavalamp
[18:47:35] <imsky> people need a plugin for this?
[18:47:45] <p1und3r> :o
[18:48:14] <coldhead> imsky: people like it because it comes with the bg imgs and it has a few unique easing effects
[18:48:24] <p1und3r> thats what they're for, so i don't have to write it :]
[18:48:26] <imsky> o_0
[18:48:33] <imsky> jquery.easing.js lolol?
[18:48:56] <p1und3r> damn you're really anti-plugin
[18:48:56] <p1und3r> :]
[18:48:58] <coldhead> jquery easing is for power users
[18:49:04] <imsky> gimme a break lol
[18:49:05] <josephpagoda> imsky, now you'll see some of the stuff i'm working on
[18:49:25] <imsky> p1und3r: nah, i like stuff by benalman, he always does quality plugins
[18:50:06] <imsky> i've been doing this jquery stuff for a couple of years now, most plugins are so tightly coupled and weirdly architected that it's just not worth the time
[18:50:11] <coldhead> ben almond <3
[18:51:36] <p1und3r> they kinda get heavy when you only want some of their functionality too
[18:55:21] <insign> how can I know the status of loading of an script? <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js"></script>
[18:56:10] <imsky> you'll just know
[19:03:58] <muzone> At www.asos.com - when you hover your mouse over the top right "Bag / Saved", this neat little box pops up showing some more info - how do I do that?
[19:04:22] <imsky> .animate and .ajax
[19:04:28] <djQuery> insign: do you know the name of some function that is in the script that you can check to see if it is there
[19:05:07] <muzone> Like Superfish is _the_ script for dropdown menus - what's _the_ script for something like this?
[19:05:20] <muzone> imsky: do you know any examples?
[19:05:30] <imsky> muzone: nah, but this isn't hard to make
[19:08:44] <muzone> imsky: imsky: That's a rather arrogant thing to say isn't it? Trying saying walking is easy to someone who's paralyzed.
[19:08:52] <imsky> lol wtf
[19:09:15] <imsky> are you mentally incapable of writing a little jquery?
[19:09:27] <insign> djQuery, good idea
[19:09:37] <djQuery> ?
[19:09:54] <djQuery> ohhtat
[19:10:13] <djQuery> insign: see ?yepnop.js
[19:10:15] <bot-t> insign, yepnope.js | A Conditional Loader For Your Polyfills! - http://yepnopejs.com/
[19:10:33] <muzone> sorta yeah
[19:10:33] <muzone> imskimsky: ill give you this if you help me out - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxQWT05OYs0
[19:11:19] <imsky> is this
[19:11:24] <imsky> some dubstep
[19:11:26] <imsky> wubwubwub
[19:12:12] <djQuery> muzone: you mean how do you make something slide down with jquery?
[19:12:23] <djQuery> hmmmm see ?.slidedown
[19:12:23] <bot-t> .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[19:13:20] <buzzomatic> Hi guys, I'm currently writing a plugin that needs to expose functions -- $(...).myPlugin().doStuff(); -- however, I'd like to be able to call these functions on any object that has previously been initialized with the plugin
[19:13:25] <buzzomatic> Is this possible?
[19:13:54] <djQuery> buzzomatic: do you have jqueryui?
[19:13:59] <buzzomatic> No
[19:14:05] <djQuery> buzzomatic: see ?widgetfactory
[19:14:06] <bot-t> buzzomatic, http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/tips-for-developing-jquery-ui-widgets/
[19:14:15] <buzzomatic> thanks

[19:14:20] <bot-t> djQuery, Charlie and the Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/charlie/
[19:14:48] <djQuery> buzzomatic: ^^^^^^
[19:16:00] <djQuery> buzzomatic: and there is this as well. http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[19:16:28] <josephpagoda> http://brushdragon.pagodabox.com ... I'm trying to use animate(), but when I click my animate link, nothing is happening, any ideas what i'm missing?
[19:16:31] <buzzomatic> Thanks for the info
[19:17:28] <djQuery> buzzomatic: with the widget factory you can call $('selector').widgetname('methodname')'
[19:17:44] <insign> djQuery, $('[id^="___plusone"] iframe').addClass('tSH') returns [ ] or [object] how can I identify this on a IF?
[19:18:07] <djQuery> .length?
[19:18:24] <insign> if ($('[id^="___plusone"] iframe').addClass('tSH')) {console.log('not exist')} else {console.log('exist')}
[19:18:33] <insign> it says always not exist
[19:18:48] <josephpagoda> nm, i figured it out
[19:19:31] <insign> djQuery, if ($('[id^="___plusone"] iframe').addClass('tSH')) {console.log('not exist')} else {console.log('exist')} it says always 'not exist' but in the first seconds the element not exist

[19:23:33] <insign> djQuery, i think that it not work on fiddle because the iframes
[19:24:04] <insign> djQuery, but is here http://jsfiddle.net/insign/uP89B/
[19:24:30] <insign> ops, let me update with the css
[19:30:11] <bobbobbins> i created  a plugin $.fn.spdi and now i want to extend it...so i tried $.fn.spdi.extend, but it doesn't like that, can someone tell me the correct way to do it?
[19:31:44] <muzone> djQuery: thanks a lot man !!
[19:31:46] <insign> How can I know how many elements has an object?
[19:32:51] <insign> lentgth :)

[19:36:47] <muzone> djQuery: http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[19:36:55] <djQuery> ah
[19:37:06] <djQuery> muzone: there is also slidetoggle
[19:39:12] <djQuery> insign: did you try reducing your selector and console.log the result?
[19:40:05] <muzone> djQuery: which one you prefer?
[19:40:17] <djQuery> depends on what I am doing
[19:40:47] <djQuery> muzone: slidetoggle sees if it is visisble if visisble slide down else slide up
[19:42:08] <insign> djQuery, thanks for all help, good night
[19:42:16] <muzone> djQuery: if you go to http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-CURVE-Exclusive-Floral-Cross-Front-Midi-Dress/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1625226&cid=9577&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=20&sort=-1&clr=Print (sorry for the long url)

[19:46:14] <coldhead> hine!
[19:46:48] <muzone> and click add to bag
[19:47:22] <muzone> then you'll see this neat box pop up at the top right corner
[19:47:22] <muzone> i want _THAT_ :D
[19:47:54] <djQuery> muzone: thats what I basicaly just gave you
[19:48:01] <djQuery> later
[19:52:33] <muzone> dj	
[19:52:33] <muzone> FUCK this box is lagging
[19:54:02] <imsky> lol
[19:54:08] <imsky> gtk is failing people tonight
[19:56:12] <comhero> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSmgd/ - Any idea why i can't get the password field to reverse? (also not sure why this doesnt work in jsfiddle)
[19:57:14] <coldhead> you have html in your JS field
[19:57:17] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSmgd/2/
[19:57:19] <comhero> yeah fixed that
[19:57:22] <imsky> lolol
[19:57:33] <comhero> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/ZSmgd/3/ :V
[19:57:47] <imsky> i see a lot of passwords with the value "Password" in your future
[19:57:57] <djQuery> coldhead: you got your javascript in my html
[19:58:15] <comhero> imsky, if the user leaves the password field empty, it will revert back to a text input and say "password"
[19:58:35] <comhero> its a login form.
[19:58:35] <imsky> and then they might forget they didn't fill it out
[19:58:50] <imsky> hmm i wonder who else does it like this
[19:58:57] <imsky> can't...really...think of anybody
[19:59:13] <coldhead> why don't you just use html5 placeholders and an html5 placeholder plugin for older browsers?
[19:59:18] <imsky> ^ +1
[19:59:22] <imsky> placeholder is sweet
[19:59:30] <djQuery> whats everyone got against <input¬†type="text"¬†name="username"¬†value="Username"¬†id="username"¬†/>¬†
[19:59:35] <imsky> and there's a jquery shim for placeholder
[19:59:38] <orolo> ?placeholder
[19:59:38] <bot-t> https://github.com/mathiasbynens/Placeholder-jQuery-Plugin - A jQuery plugin which enables HTML5 placeholder behavior for browsers that aren‚Äôt trying hard enough yet
[19:59:42] <coldhead> several shims*
[19:59:51] <djQuery> opps ment to delet not enter since someone else said it
[19:59:57] <imsky> wubwubwub
[20:00:05] <abjorn> man
[20:00:08] <imsky> hahaha
[20:00:10] <abjorn> media temple hosting is so...great
[20:00:12] <abjorn> but
[20:00:14] <imsky> yeah dude
[20:00:16] <abjorn> they use plesk :<
[20:00:19] <imsky> legendary hosting since my salad dayz
[20:00:26] <imsky> kaliber10000 people indahauuuus
[20:00:38] <comhero> coldhead, thanks
[20:00:45] <abjorn> cpanel isn't fantastic or anything but it's plenty better than plesk, fuk
[20:00:50] <imsky> you prefer...cpanel?
[20:00:53] <coldhead> comhero: http://jsfiddle.net/ZSmgd/4/
[20:00:56] <abjorn> yeah
[20:00:57] <coldhead> so much less code! :)
[20:01:00] <abjorn> i mean, the look is ugly but
[20:01:04] <abjorn> the ui is so much easier
[20:01:11] <imsky> lol stop bitching about your MT hosting
[20:01:12] <abjorn> it's a lot easier to find what you want
[20:01:22] <abjorn> I don't have MT hosting
[20:01:28] <abjorn> I don't have a need for scalable hosting lol
[20:01:35] <imsky> daaaamn
[20:01:37] <abjorn> I have a website that gets like...10 hits a month. lol
[20:01:40] <imsky> then what are you whining about
[20:01:50] <abjorn> I DON'T LIKE PLESK GAWD
[20:01:53] <abjorn> I think it's a shame they use it
[20:02:12] <coldhead> i use pastebin.com for my hosting
[20:02:25] <abjorn> goodman
[20:02:35] <imsky> lol
[20:03:13] <abjorn> Parallels are really good programmers, just not the best interface designers lol
[20:03:26] <abjorn> At least virtuozzo rox so
[20:04:01] <imsky> i recall something to do with pastebin
[20:04:50] <abjorn> i really do wish I had a valid excuse to use MT lol
[20:04:56] <abjorn> other than "they're awesome"
[20:05:25] <djQuery> abjorn: it will inspire you to build something that can actualy utilize it
[20:05:37] * djQuery wish granted
[20:05:42] <abjorn> rofl
[20:05:51] <abjorn> Now if only I had the time to build whatever that would be
[20:06:19] <imsky> WEB HOOKS
[20:06:21] <imsky> that's it
[20:06:29] <imsky> wow, that was 2 years ago
[20:06:38] <imsky> had to go to my old sql dumps to find out
[20:06:51] <abjorn> me and my friend had a pretty good idea that would be easy to develop, just not easy to launch...haha
[20:07:00] <abjorn> we never did figure it out
[20:07:01] <imsky> http://www.webhooks.org/
[20:07:07] <imsky> to this day, a sweet idea
[20:07:30] <RobSpectre> How do you trigger a jQuery UI color animation without using toggle?
[20:07:59] <djQuery> RobSpectre: .animate
[20:08:05] <djQuery> ?ui.animate
[20:08:05] <bot-t> The jQuery UI effects core extends the¬†animate¬†function to be able to animate colors as well. http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[20:08:54] <RobSpectre> djQuery: Example of what I'm doing - box.animate({backgroundColor: 'green'}, 'fast');
[20:08:59] <RobSpectre> Doesn't seem to have an effect.
[20:09:11] <RobSpectre> Effect does work when I put it in a toggle.
[20:09:25] <RobSpectre> Example you cited also uses toggle - not sure what I'm doing wrong here.
[20:11:55] <djQuery> RobSpectre: {'background-color': 'green'}
[20:12:48] <abjorn> I wish Socket.io has a Python backend too, as well as the Node backend :<
[20:12:51] <abjorn> would be nice
[20:12:59] <abjorn> too bad im not that good of a python hacker, or I'd do it
[20:13:37] <RobSpectre> djQuery: that doesn't seem to work either.  Documentation says it's backgroundColor...
[20:14:07] <RobSpectre> djQuery: As I say, if I wrap it in a toggle the effect works.  I just don't want to make the element disappear - just change the background color.
[20:15:27] <djQuery> RobSpectre: I have never actualy used it.
[20:15:40] <RobSpectre> djQuery: thinking maybe I should just use switchClass.
[20:22:41] <abjorn> imsky: so...no one has done that webhooks thing? or what, im not understanding
[20:22:57] <abjorn> nvm yeah they have
[20:23:02] <imsky> it hasn't really spread, i guess
[20:23:04] <abjorn> just never heard of it haha
[20:23:13] <abjorn> was gonna say, it's not like it's hard
[20:23:14] <bobbobbins> i figured out how to extend my plugin, now is there a way to get a list of extensions a plugin has?
[20:23:22] <abjorn> post a message to a url, not difficult
[20:23:22] <imsky> there's kind of a "pc manufacturers" thing going on right now with the programmable web
[20:23:31] <imsky> everyone loves their platform and don't want to play with the others
[20:23:35] <abjorn> lol
[20:23:41] <abjorn> yeah, that'll happen
[20:23:52] <abjorn> it'll sort itself out eventually
[20:24:00] <abjorn> or, you know, it wont, you never know
[20:24:05] <abjorn> but it probably will
[20:24:16] <imsky> man that's deep
[20:24:24] <abjorn> bobbobbins: Uhm...look at the code?
[20:24:50] <bobbobbins> abjorn: well yes...but i want the plugin to know without me having to tell it
[20:26:13] <abjorn> hm
[20:26:15] <abjorn> dunno then
[20:32:14] <djQuery> bobbobbins: loop over the properties like anyother object
[20:32:36] <bobbobbins> djQuery...hmm...ok, I'll try
[20:33:54] <bobbobbins> another question...I have a call that is $.spdi.makeGraph()  but the name makeGraph is stored in a variable...how can i call it?
[20:34:00] <bobbobbins> if that makes any sense
[20:34:47] <abjorn> I like how at work we have an internal tool called SuperTool that's built with jQuery UI
[20:34:54] <abjorn> so it has jquery and jquery ui
[20:34:57] <abjorn> yet it still uses window.onload
[20:35:35] <lazypower> wow
[20:35:45] <lazypower> $document.ready() not satisfactory to them?
[20:36:05] <lazypower> djQuery: i owe you a coffee for the help you gave me last week.
[20:36:12] <lazypower> s/last week/ earlier this week
[20:36:20] <abjorn> Yeah I guess not looll
[20:38:30] <djQuery> lazypower: well I need some cafine so let me collect now
[20:38:39] <djQuery> ?time lazypower
[20:38:41] <bot-t> djQuery, No results found for 'lazypower'.
[20:38:46] <djQuery> ?time
[20:38:47] <bot-t> djQuery, Dallas, TX - Time: 22:38 Thursday (CDT), Weather: Clear, 29∞C / 85∞F
[20:38:52] <lazypower> djQuery: I'm assuming Pittsburgh is a far drive for you
[20:39:21] <djQuery> lazypower: ur the one that owes so it would be fair for u to deliver here
[20:39:33] <lazypower> haha, i'll paypal you the buck fifty
[20:40:13] <djQuery> bitcoin
[20:40:35] <lazypower> You know, i've heard of bit coin, but i'm still not certain how its not some ponzi scheme
[20:41:10] <muzone> djQuery: so basically i make a div and load it with .slideDown?
[20:41:42] <djQuery> muzone: sure
[20:42:11] <muzone> hthanks man
[20:49:02] <djQuery> lazypower: and payin for someone coffee aint nutn like buyin someone a coffee
[20:49:14] <djQuery> lazypower: glad it worked out for you
[20:50:28] <lazypower> djQuery: true, but you're not local so buying you a coffee is kind of out the window.
[20:52:37] <abjorn> apparently irc servers aren't allowed on hostgators' servers
[20:52:49] <abjorn> like it's a security risk
[20:53:10] <lazypower> abjorn: hostgator is not known for being terribly flexible
[20:53:13] <abjorn> or bots or scripts, anything to do
[20:53:17] <abjorn> actually you'd be surprised
[20:53:45] <abjorn> trust me, we have to jump through hoops to do shit for customers who want some weird thing working in their hosting
[20:54:02] <lazypower> nah, i used hostgator as a reseller for a while... i fell out of cahoots with them once linode gave me something worth having.
[20:54:23] <abjorn> lol
[20:54:47] <abjorn> what didn't they let you do? I mean I guess I kinda understand not allowing irc, it's not the most secure thing in the world
[20:55:17] <abjorn> everything else they don't allow is just kind of a legal thing, or it's just not going to work very well on the servers
[20:56:43] <lazypower> i had a few sites taken down for copywright infringement that was bogus, i spent 3 days on the phone with them before they admitted they were wrong and did a bare-metal restore... which ended up taking yet another 24 hours. Thank god i kept my own backups and had dyndns - i just routed them to my shitbox in the closet for a few days and they dealt with sub-par hosting for a few days until it all cleared up. Now that i'm on linode, i h
[20:56:56] <lazypower> s/copywright/copyright
[20:57:03] <lazypower> wow i can spell, i promise.
[20:57:15] <abjorn> that's pretty balls
[20:57:36] <abjorn> they're supposed to need pretty concrete proof of copyright ownership before they do that sort of thing
[20:57:41] <lazypower> yeah, their over-zealous legal enforcement cost them, and nearly cost me a few clients.
[20:57:44] <abjorn> I guess sometimes some techs fuck up tho
[20:58:23] <abjorn> I had a guy call today about copyright infringement. When I went to the site he was complaining about I laughed my ass off
[20:58:29] <abjorn> lemme see if I can find it again lol
[20:58:31] <lazypower> yeah, i dont hold the entire company responsible, but i wont promote them either because my service was pretty crap considering the length of time it took them to correct it. had it been 24/48 hours all would have been good. once it hit the 62 hour mark, i started shopping.
[20:58:49] <djQuery> hear about the fbi coming in and grabing all the servers of a company that was co-loc'd somewhere?
[20:59:05] <lazypower> djQuery: yeah that was my cousin :P j/k
[20:59:45] <abjorn> lazypower: I guess it always depends. I get my hosting through a HostGator reseller, and he's always had good things to say - part of the reason I applied to work at HostGator.
[20:59:53] <abjorn> that and I just plain needed a job lol
[21:00:17] <abjorn> oh yeah, lmfao, this was it http://www.whythesafetybulletsucks.com/
[21:00:27] <bobbobbins> can someone take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/wW9Pr/1/ I'm passing school_id as 2, but in firebug when 'getData' is called, school_id is set to 1...can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[21:00:32] <abjorn> guy who called me was the owner of the copyright for the safety bullet
[21:01:06] <lazypower> abjorn: well, hopefully the DMCA business wont be so hard-core while you're there. I know it was horrid in 2009 when all that business went down
[21:01:37] <abjorn> Well, even if it is, nothing I can do about it
[21:01:45] <abjorn> since that's all the security departments job
[21:01:55] <abjorn> I have to forward people who want to make a DMCA complain to them
[21:02:09] <lazypower> \o/
[21:02:12] <lazypower> yay security
[21:02:25] * lazypower mutters and grumbles
[21:02:27] <abjorn> http://www.safetybullet.com/ hah I recognize that guys voice still
[21:02:33] <abjorn> he was so maddd
[21:03:32] <lazypower> \o/Theres so many reasons the safety bullet sucks, my keyboard fell apart typing them all up‚Ä¶I had to post this from my iphone. bahahahahahahahahahahaha
[21:03:39] <abjorn> I know lmfao
[21:03:47] <abjorn> I swear that guy must be a h/c troll
[21:04:54] <lazypower> uhm, safetybullet.com looks like a barf site from the early 90's
[21:04:58] <abjorn> the sad part is the guys safety bullet thing is actually a pretty good idea
[21:05:00] <abjorn> yeah it does rofl
[21:05:10] <bobbobbins> can someone check that out?
[21:05:19] <abjorn> ah ok bobbobbins
[21:05:32] <bobbobbins> (sorry to nag)
[21:05:41] <abjorn> nah its fine, i was being off topic haha
[21:05:58] <bobbobbins> i guess its not catching the if(options)
[21:07:03] <abjorn> man im just
[21:07:07] <abjorn> im too tired to look at code lol
[21:07:10] <abjorn> been a long day...
[21:07:14] <bobbobbins> haha, no worries
[21:07:47] <lazypower> abjorn: i hear ya, and i'm still doing code as homework O.o
[21:08:04] <lazypower> abjorn: VB / C# / Javascript all day, then come home to do loads of C++. yay me.
[21:08:12] <bobbobbins> yeah, i have a deadline at work tomorrow, so im stuck working till the wee hours
[21:08:24] <abjorn> lol
[21:08:33] <abjorn> who would want to come home and C++ after a day of work? geez
[21:08:37] <lazypower> bobbobbins: i feel ya. I have deadlines every day, my company doesnt believe in agile/scrum
[21:08:38] <abjorn> hahaha
[21:09:01] <bobbobbins> ouch
[21:09:14] <lazypower> abjorn: eh, its not *so* bad... i just wish i was finished with school. I know a majority of this crap, once you get intimate with one language its pretty much semantic/syntax differences.
[21:09:40] <lazypower> thats a gross over generalization, but i'm sure you get the point.
[21:09:43] <abjorn> yeah i get that
[21:09:53] <abjorn> ive dealt with the same thing lol
[21:10:08] <lazypower> i mean, once you have google at your finger tips and you understand the semantics of whats going on, you can do anything.
[21:10:10] <abjorn> although that's not entirely true about the "once you get intimate with one language"
[21:10:20] <abjorn> get intimate with C++ then try Scheme, wont be so easy haha
[21:10:27] <lazypower> ughhh
[21:10:28] <lazypower> scheme
[21:10:30] <lazypower> why?
[21:10:35] <abjorn> or any functional language, really
[21:10:38] <lazypower> why would you bring that up in the same sentence?
[21:10:41] <bobbobbins> hehe, the company i work for now(i just started) thinks javascript and java are the same thing
[21:10:41] <abjorn> :D
[21:10:43] <abjorn> <3 scheme
[21:10:45] * lazypower slaps abjorn 
[21:10:47] <abjorn> :<
[21:10:53] <lazypower> shame on you
[21:10:53] <abjorn> or, hell, haskell
[21:10:54] <abjorn> haha
[21:10:55] <lazypower> you can reform
[21:11:13] <abjorn> I'd love to see a C++ expert with no functional experience try and learn Haskell
[21:11:26] <abjorn> I have functional language experience and I struggle with haskell lol
[21:11:58] <lazypower> i'd rather stay away from the lambda calculus cloud kthnx
[21:12:11] <abjorn> lololol
[21:12:17] <abjorn> lambda calculus is kinda neato
[21:12:24] <abjorn> too bad I don't understand most of it
[21:12:26] <lazypower> granted, i write .Net that touches on it (in very minor ways)
[21:12:42] <abjorn> I try and learn lambda calculus and my mind is just full of fuck
[21:12:55] <lazypower> but lambda calculus is enough to make me want to peel my eyeballs... i'm struggling with trig as it is :|
[21:12:56] <abjorn> of course, that's probably because wikipedia isn't a very good place to try and learn lambda calculus lol
[21:13:04] <abjorn> they dont exact teach it at many colleges....lol
[21:13:19] <abjorn> certainly not at mine
[21:13:40] <lazypower> its a concept that gained steam in teh 1930's to investigate function definition, function application, and recursion! <wikipedia snippet>
[21:13:54] <abjorn> lol
[21:14:11] <lazypower> i can do that in bash, let alone haskell or erlang
[21:14:18] <lazypower> so foo on lambda calculus
[21:14:25] <abjorn> what do you mean
[21:14:47] <abjorn> do what in bash lol
[21:15:07] <lazypower> i can define functions in bash.
[21:15:15] <lazypower> i can apply functions in bash
[21:15:21] <lazypower> and by god, i'll recurse in bash too
[21:15:27] <abjorn> That doesn't really have anything to do with lambda calculus though lol
[21:15:33] <lazypower> ..... >.>
[21:15:38] <lazypower> i was being obtuse
[21:15:42] <abjorn> oh
[21:15:44] <abjorn> IT'S LATE
[21:15:46] <lazypower> haha
[21:15:46] <abjorn> GAWD
[21:15:48] <abjorn> fuck it im going to bed
[21:15:51] <lazypower> my sarcasm has fooled you

[21:40:52] <weedle> how can i use js or jquery to work out what ive come to?
[21:41:35] <djQuery> weedle: try console.log(window.location) and look what u have to work with on that
[21:41:36] <lazypower> read the window.location property and determine based on the url
[21:41:47] <lazypower> djQuery: gmta
[21:42:02] <djQuery> good evenin
[21:42:13] <djQuery> 19 mins till morn
[21:42:17] <lazypower> gmta = great minds think alike
[21:42:43] <datarecall> in jquery is there a way to get the current url i need to pass the $_GET vars to ajax
[21:42:44] <djQuery> lazypower: no actualy i edited yours to where only 1 was selectable take a closer look http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/zPTKK/2/
[21:42:58] <djQuery> oh missed that comment
[21:43:25] <lazypower> i'm looking now, sorry i'm in the middle of a ubuntu install
[21:43:38] <djQuery> whooo hoooo
[21:44:31] <lazypower> yea you extended it quite a bit
[21:44:42] <lazypower> i was giving the quick and dirty answer. you gave a functional answer. +1 to djquery's edits.
[21:45:19] <lazypower> and tbh, i didnt know the parent() operator worked like that... i'll have to add that to my bag o tricks.
[21:45:39] <djQuery> .parent or .closest are cool
[21:45:46] <lazypower> i've got quite a few validators on forms i'm working on at work that could use functionality like that. specifically on radio button groups.
[21:46:06] <djQuery> fuck that

[21:47:01] <djQuery> yes it is
[21:47:27] <lazypower> i like the bassistance.de, i need to extend it to "look pretty" as my boss calls it so i can roll it up in several deploys.
[21:47:33] <lazypower> and indeed, kaplan, lol.
[21:47:44] <lazypower> only not lol, makes me want to punch babies... in the face...
[21:47:57] <djQuery> better than who i am workin for
[21:48:08] <lazypower> their data scrubbing is extremely militant
[21:48:12] <Cluber1> Is there anything equivalent to document.getElementById().scrollIntoView(true); available in jQuery?
[21:48:29] <lazypower> i dont work for kaplan, i work for university-bound. A much nicer company from what i gather.

[21:50:58] <djQuery> lazypower: but its better than installing windows 2008
[21:51:02] <lazypower> OOO thats pretty djQuery
[21:51:06] <lazypower> bookmarking for later
[21:51:15] <djQuery> last time took like 8 hours
[21:51:41] <lazypower> djQuery: i have a win2k8 server in my closet, the install only took 30 minutes on a dual core 2 gig's of ram pc.
[21:52:23] <lazypower> I'm torn on if i want to keep programming in .net or move over to the dark side and learn rails, or stick with old reliable and continue my PHP development.
[21:52:33] <djQuery> lazypower: yes and then to install sql and all the other stuff not to mention download spXXXXX and 2000 hotfixes
[21:53:04] <djQuery> lazypower: between php and .net u should find jobs easy.
[21:53:06] <lazypower> i'm having a toolbox issue, and dont know if its time to do new stuff or stick with what i know.
[21:53:12] <djQuery> just stay away from silverlight
[21:53:13] <lazypower> i'm turning them down, not to toot my horn.
[21:53:17] <lazypower> too late
[21:53:22] <lazypower> already wrote a webcam applet in silverlight
[21:53:54] <djQuery> kiss those skills goob bye there are rumors that they are dropping it
[21:54:08] <lazypower> i'm glad, i wasnt that versed in it
[21:54:43] <lazypower> my latest bish has been Linq, EntityFramework, and a <censored> ton of webforms programming since this system in inherited is webforms based.. and might i add, i hate viewstate.
[21:54:59] <lazypower> s/in/i
[21:55:21] <djQuery> mvc3 and you can turn off viewstate in 3.5 up
[21:55:33] <lazypower> indeed. in mvc3 + it went away
[21:55:58] <djQuery> no in plain web forms with .net 3.5 or 4 you can turn off viewstate
[21:56:02] <lazypower> but its not cost effective to have me re-write the entire site in mvc3. I just spent the last 2 weeks doing a static HTML breakout since the content never really changes.
[21:56:05] <lazypower> :O
[21:56:07] <lazypower> you can?!
[21:56:23] <djQuery> yes.
[21:56:34] <lazypower> oh my, i will indeed be investigating that.
[21:57:06] <djQuery> was writing a whole call tracking that just used webservices 2.0 and webforms with no viewstate
[21:57:39] <lazypower> dude, webservices. how i love writing restful web services, let me count the ways
[21:57:49] <djQuery> lazypower: you can turn it off in the web.config for everything then just turn it on for a page or even an idividual element
[21:58:19] <lazypower> djQuery: you're a vertible wikipedia of information. Do you come in a pocket edition?
[21:58:56] * djQuery errases that comment before sending it
[21:59:13] <lazypower> i think i know where you were taking it... :X

[22:06:51] <lazypower> hurray for king missile!
[22:09:18] <lazypower> i havent heard this jam since highschool
[22:14:26] <djQuery> thought suicidal did that originaly

[22:16:19] <djQuery> grew up on that stuff "I saw your mommy", institutionlized etc..

[22:30:35] <djQuery> Cluber1: look at the way see ?.validate

[22:30:51] <bobbobbins> im using .attr('id') to get the id of a div, and i want to see if it contains a certain string, whats the best way to do that?
[22:30:56] <djQuery> it has 1 file per language
[22:31:25] <Cluber1> hmm
[22:31:36] <djQuery> bobbobbins: .toLower().indexOf('somestring')

[22:38:07] <bobbobbins> i actually already read that, i tend to think i know what im doing...but i get stuck on something stupid
[22:39:52] <bobbobbins> like $this.attr('id') works fine, but if I add .indexOf('somestring'), i get an error
[22:40:24] <djQuery> i saw this week that they were able to add a memory chip to rats to extend thier memory.
[22:40:43] <djQuery> how long till this is avialable as a plugin
[22:41:50] <bobbobbins> i want one

[23:06:11] <bobbobbins> some sort of $spdi. + function_name + ($this, arguments)...but obviously that doesn't work

[23:08:06] <bobbobbins> im guessing what im saying makes no sense
[23:08:22] <sk8ball> i know this is done via the update: part of the sortable
[23:08:42] <djQuery> so now u have the seriazed either call an ajax or put it in a hidden field for post
[23:09:01] <sk8ball> but im wondering how i know what list i dropped the list item in
[23:09:19] <djQuery> 2 hidden inputs one for each list

[23:23:33] <WebGear> guys what is the best way to link to jQuery or a jQuery plugin? is it better if i download it to the server or is it ok to link to it on the jQuery server?
[23:25:13] <djQuery> sk8ball: well I could go on but u gotta earn ur check somehow
[23:26:01] <sk8ball> or ndj, ok so once i generate hidden inputs representing the list id of each list item, how do i a) change that id to the that of the list the item was just dropped to, and b) post that new information to the webbservice - via the update "event" of the sortable plugin
[23:26:21] <sk8ball> -or ndj,
[23:26:53] <djQuery> ?g jquery cdn@webgear
[23:26:54] <bot-t> webgear, Downloading jQuery - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[23:27:03] <sk8ball> give me a little more insight in to this please ... i'm not that well versed in javascript
[23:29:11] <djQuery> ur webservice needs to accept {[{'id': idoflist, 'items': [serialize the lists]] },{etc}]}
[23:29:22] <djQuery> sk8ball: got that part at least?
[23:32:23] <djQuery> WebGear: and as far as plugins go you wont be able to find a cdn too often so you may have to serve themfrom your server
[23:33:27] <djQuery> sk8ball: and i wouldnt do this via the updated event of the sortable. let them make all thier changes then hit a save button.
[23:34:00] <djQuery> sk8ball: allthough it may be easier to do the update event you are going to have 2 lists updating not just 1.
[23:34:56] <djQuery> not to mention that I have seen a lotta chatter because when people see something like this they just start makeing a lotta changes playing with it.
[23:36:55] <sk8ball> query, yah i pretty much understand everything except to how exactly pass that to the web service
[23:39:04] <sk8ball> like in the $.ajax() how to for the data: string
[23:39:11] <sk8ball> how to form*
[23:39:54] <sk8ball> progmatically that is, like how i get the list id of the new list, and the item id of the dragged list item
[23:40:06] <sk8ball> thats what i need to know
[23:40:41] <sk8ball> i guess that was a very round about way of getting to that very specific question =[]
[23:40:45] <sk8ball> its getting late
[23:45:34] <sk8ball> dj, how would i represent i know the list id of the new list, and the item id of the dragged item progmatically?
[23:59:41] <Cluber1> How do i set the scrollbar at a certain place on my page?
[23:59:51] <Cluber1> for example, scroll to the top of a page
