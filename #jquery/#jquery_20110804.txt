[00:01:50] <Nonpython> how do I call a callback when the value of a <select> changes?
[00:02:21] <drd> $('#myselect').change(function() { .. });
[00:03:49] <wangdoo> drd: using selector on table,when i click on one particular column click event should not work.i used td:not(:nth-child()) but this is not working
[00:05:39] <Nonpython> http://jsfiddle.net/nprqu/1/ is my code
[00:05:43] <Nonpython> it doesn't work
[00:06:32] <nail_> Nonpython: wrap that in the ready handler
[00:06:36] <nail_> that will work
[00:34:22] <cypha> why is "function()" in these functions? http://codepad.org/1lgdJCuu
[00:35:00] <cypha> why does it need function() written before the actual desired event or whatever
[00:46:15] <cypha> so quiet??
[00:47:16] <NoNoNo> It was a quiet night. The sky clear of anything but the countless stars that twinkled beautifully.
[00:47:29] <DefV> cypha: because that's how the JS language works, in order to do these events, you pass in functions that execute when a click event triggers
[00:57:39] <ckb> I'm really confused. after I call .html(html), .height() returns something very different than it should
[01:31:37] <amit_usual> is there a library that will help encode multipart-form data  parameters

[01:33:30] <trickz> when you write something in #a , why doesnt it alert LOL ? basically i am trying to bind the change event on #b via change in #a
[01:37:00] <wangdoo> when i click on the name,it changes into text box and if again click it,text is vanishing but it should n't   http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/2/  how to remove other click
[01:37:33] <trickz> Halo ?
[01:38:29] <wangdoo> trickz:  when i click on the name,it changes into text box and if again click it,text is vanishing but it should n't   http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/2/  how to remove other click
[01:39:36] <trickz> no, i have my own question that no one has answered yet
[01:47:25] <davetarmac> hey guys - I'm looking for a transition effect library like the flash on the right of this page: http://www.mattroberts.co.uk/london/default/index.asp
[01:47:34] <davetarmac> I've seen one, but I can't remember what it's called before
[01:48:16] <trickz> http://jsfiddle.net/68Geb/1/
[01:48:19] <trickz> when you write something in #a , why doesnt it alert LOL ? basically i am trying to bind the change event on #b via change in #a
[01:48:34] <angryasian> trickz I have no idea why that doesn't happen. :[  maybe manually trigger b's change event ?
[01:48:42] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/68Geb/2/
[01:48:48] <tdignan> wangdoo: you need to unbind the click listener after the first click, or use a boolean to keep track of whether it has been clicked yet.
[01:49:20] <trickz> yes i know, thats a way. but that is lame, no ?
[01:49:24] <trickz> angryasian:
[01:49:30] <trickz> btw, are you an angry Asian ?
[01:50:05] <tdignan> wangdoo: if you right click your textbox, you'll see its inside your <td id="tag"> which responds to clicks.
[01:50:23] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to check if a text field has any content in it?
[01:50:29] <tdignan> and on the second click, there is not ext in the tag, so it fills it with nothing.
[01:50:51] <trickz> SoulRaven: you can do $('input[type="text"]).val().length();
[01:51:00] <trickz> probably trim on thag to get rid of spaces and tabs
[01:54:04] <wangdoo> tdignan: here if i put $(this).unbind();,it is working but it si not working for live()
[01:56:20] <trickz> this is lame
[01:56:26] <trickz> anyone else ?
[01:57:00] <xec> you're asking if anyone else is lame?
[01:57:16] <ajpiano> trickz: setting .val() doesn't trigger a change event

[02:02:22] <trickz> ajpiano: well
[02:02:30] <trickz> when you manually set val
[02:02:34] <trickz> it triggers change event
[02:02:41] <trickz> and when you dot it iwht jquery it doesnt ?
[02:02:54] <SugaSlide> -_-
[02:03:03] <blackspotwiggins> trickz, does it now?
[02:03:24] <ajpiano> what do you mean, manually set it
[02:03:46] <trickz> i mean you enter some value int the text field
[02:03:47] <trickz> into
[02:03:52] <trickz> it triggers a change event
[02:04:04] <trickz> when you do it with jquery using .val() it doesnt ? huh ?
[02:04:28] <trickz> basically i wanna say that it should
[02:04:37] <ajpiano> uhhhh
[02:04:42] <ajpiano> that's like saying

[02:05:26] <trickz> dam it
[02:05:46] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/MzaiaJ5A  ----- is there any particular reason why my $mainContent.fadeIn() method is not fading in? it is just appearing.
[02:06:03] <trickz> why $mainContent ?
[02:06:08] <angryasian> ok im back trickz
[02:06:08] <trickz> why prefix variable with $
[02:06:12] <trickz> this is not your sucking php
[02:06:32] <trickz> i am here asian
[02:06:35] <jaypitidi> I like the way it looks
[02:06:38] <trickz> asjpiano gave me the answer
[02:06:40] <trickz> it sucks :P
[02:06:43] <ajpiano> it's a matter of convention
[02:06:55] <ajpiano> ah, well i was about to post you the same bot thing but botty's not here
[02:07:17] <trickz> call him, easy bro
[02:07:18] <angryasian> well ok so it doesnt trigger a change event.  thats a jquery thing then.
[02:07:21] <blackspotwiggins> somekindof twisted form of hungarian notation
[02:07:26] <angryasian> gotta work around
[02:07:32] <trickz> yes
[02:07:32] <blackspotwiggins> its not a jquery thing
[02:07:35] <trickz> .val().change();
[02:07:40] <trickz> .......
[02:07:42] <blackspotwiggins> it's how dom works
[02:07:43] <angryasian> .val() is a jquery function
[02:07:44] <blackspotwiggins> deal with it
[02:07:50] <trickz> ok
[02:07:54] <trickz> i will deal wit it
[02:08:01] <angryasian> so .val("Stuff") should trigger a change event
[02:08:08] <trickz> i have dealt with loads of stuff, this is no biggie
[02:08:08] <gjvc> if i have mulitple select elements, with a change event on one which changes something in a second select element, will that event propagate by default?
[02:08:13] <angryasian> but it doesnt.  SHOULD IT? thats the real question
[02:08:19] <trickz> angryasian: it doesnt, and wont
[02:08:21] <angryasian> cause if it should.  that's a bug
[02:08:28] <trickz> who knows
[02:08:34] <ajpiano> it does not, it should not
[02:08:36] <trickz> bsw asked me to deal with it
[02:08:37] <blackspotwiggins> no it should not
[02:08:37] <angryasian> if manually adding text triggers a chance event on blur()
[02:08:44] <angryasian> change*
[02:08:46] <blackspotwiggins> val sets the value
[02:08:47] <blackspotwiggins> thats it
[02:08:52] <blackspotwiggins> why should it do anything else
[02:08:58] <trickz> to make our life easier
[02:09:09] <blackspotwiggins> what if you want to avoid triggering events
[02:09:19] <blackspotwiggins> it's easier for your case
[02:09:20] <gjvc> blackspotwiggins, does it return the old value as well?
[02:09:22] <angryasian> .val() can change the text as well as trigger a .change() event.  it doesnt make your life any worse
[02:09:26] <trickz> .val('').notrigger() :D
[02:09:40] <blackspotwiggins> no
[02:09:40] <angryasian> if it did MORE its not necessarily worse
[02:09:45] <trickz> righto
[02:09:48] <blackspotwiggins> less magic = good
[02:09:57] <trickz> ok bro
[02:09:58] <ajpiano> then jquery should have .val("foo", "no change event please") and pass a stringy flag where you  telll jquery a sentence describing what you want it to do
[02:10:06] <blackspotwiggins> maybe it should set a class valuefilled as well?
[02:10:13] <angryasian> "The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements. For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus."
[02:10:26] <angryasian> so when you manually change it.  It should trigger a change event
[02:10:37] <trickz> yes
[02:10:47] <trickz> so basically i have to explicitly trigger clik
[02:10:48] <trickz> fine
[02:10:49] <trickz> good
[02:10:49] <blackspotwiggins> angryasian, that specifically says user interaction
[02:10:52] <blackspotwiggins> not programmatic access
[02:10:55] <trickz> i'm glad we had this konversation
[02:10:56] <trickz> now
[02:10:59] <trickz> Konversation Terminated
[02:11:21] <davidw> so... what is the default mime type for $.ajax ?
[02:11:31] <angryasian> hm... true.
[02:12:03] <angryasian> so the other input box never changes.  as its readonly
[02:12:27] <angryasian> and you cant change text / trigger blur()
[02:12:33] <angryasian> I'm fine with that
[02:13:22] <seutje> what's the best way to interpret a string as a function (named or anonymous)
[02:13:38] <seutje> for use in binding
[02:14:39] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, like "functionname".call or similar?
[02:14:42] <seutje> like var foo = 'function() { /* doShit */ }'; $(foo).bind('click', foo); but foo could also be a reference to an existing function, but still as a string
[02:15:14] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: would that support anonymous functions?
[02:15:31] <blackspotwiggins> its not actual code, i dont think you can call() strings
[02:15:36] <blackspotwiggins> im not sure how to do it
[02:16:02] <blackspotwiggins> if its a object property it would be object[string]()
[02:16:13] <blackspotwiggins> anonymous functions dont have names tho?
[02:17:04] <seutje> yea, that's sorta the problem
[02:17:09] <seutje> wanna refrain from evalling
[02:18:11] <blackspotwiggins> you could do new Function(), but thats almost the same
[02:18:25] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/MzaiaJ5A  ----- is there any particular reason why my $mainContent.fadeIn() method is not fading in? it is just appearing.
[02:19:10] <seutje> yea, that's just a safe eval, innit?
[02:19:45] <angryasian> 200miliseconds isn't a large enough time ?  try a longer time and see if it works
[02:20:14] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: and then I'd have to trim some crap off the string...
[02:20:14] <angryasian> plus your fadeIn function does nothing... so.. maybe thats why?
[02:20:18] <krz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6938802/trying-to-get-tag-it-to-work-with-an-ajax-call anyone wanna have a look?
[02:20:35] <angryasian> oh wait it does do something.  my bad
[02:21:44] <angryasian> I'm assuming $mainContent evaluates to some div or the other
[02:22:18] <jaypitidi> yes. but it is still the same if fadeIn(9000)
[02:22:33] <angryasian> well do the fade in outside the load.. thats what i'd do :o
[02:22:52] <angryasian> tell it to fade in the load.
[02:23:15] <angryasian> Maybe give me / us an actual div to work with on jsfiddle or something? :[
[02:24:23] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, it's reasonable to say you cant do it without eval
[02:24:39] <wangdoo> angryasian:  why td:nth-child() not working on live('click',function ({)
[02:24:40] <jaypitidi> $mainContent.fadeIn(900, function(){$mainContent.load(newHash + " #guts", function() {
[02:24:41] <jaypitidi> ?
[02:24:47] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: looks like it'll be a pain in the ass either way :P
[02:24:54] <angryasian> yes exactly jay
[02:24:57] <blackspotwiggins> why do you need to stringeval anonymous functions anyway=?
[02:25:02] <jaypitidi> crossing my fingers
[02:25:15] <wangdoo> angryasian:  what?
[02:27:00] <wangdoo> angryasian:  see this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/3/, here unbind() is working but if it put live(),it is not working
[02:27:20] <wangdoo> jaypitidi: pls,look at my problem
[02:28:11] <jaypitidi> I am sure I would be no help to you
[02:28:33] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: want to send functions, or functions references over JSON
[02:28:41] <seutje> sounds kosher, right? :D
[02:28:59] <blackspotwiggins> load errything up first, send references
[02:29:07] <seutje> hmz?
[02:29:21] <blackspotwiggins> on the first page load, get all the possible functions
[02:29:25] <blackspotwiggins> and store them somewhere
[02:29:26] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/5/
[02:29:33] <angryasian> this is whaat you want to do wangdoo
[02:29:34] <blackspotwiggins> then do tonsofshit[namefromjson]()
[02:29:37] <seutje> :/
[02:29:54] <angryasian> live isn't a substiture for click.  live just says do this even if dom changes
[02:31:07] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: how about this? http://solutoire.com/2008/06/12/sending-javascript-functions-over-json/
[02:31:17] <angryasian> let me rephrase that: live basically says apply whatever is inside the live function to new dom elements as well.
[02:31:17] <seutje> looks hacky as fuck though
[02:31:48] <blackspotwiggins> and unsafe
[02:31:57] <blackspotwiggins> eval() by nature is unsafe
[02:31:58] <wangdoo> angryasian:  when you click first time data is present,click again ,data ii vanish.it should not vanish
[02:32:45] <angryasian> true.  hold on.
[02:32:54] <seutje> ah wait, boo, this is a php solution :/
[02:34:19] <jaypitidi> angryasian, I figured it out. I have to $mainContent.fadeOut() then .load(......function(){$mainContent.fadeIn()
[02:35:06] <seutje> guess I'll have to eval :(
[02:36:22] <angryasian> aaah that makes sense jay.  fade deals with opacity.  if you did .show() then that would have worked (assuming the div was hidden .hide() before).
[02:36:42] <angryasian> fadeOut basically said make its opacity to 1 in 200ms
[02:36:46] <angryasian> but its opacity was already 1
[02:36:48] <angryasian> so it did nothing
[02:36:55] <angryasian> fadeIn* I mean
[02:37:11] <wangdoo> angryasian: it is vanishing,how to prevent click
[02:37:33] <angryasian> yeah wangdoo I'm trying to figure out your problem :P
[02:37:42] <wangdoo> angryasian: okay
[02:38:39] <angryasian> I see your problem!
[02:38:56] <angryasian> if you run .text() on an input.  its goign to give you nothing.
[02:39:07] <angryasian> thats whats happening when you run it the second time around
[02:39:13] <angryasian> by run I mean click
[02:39:30] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: maybe this clarifies what I was going for -> $(el.wrapper, el.attributes).html(el.markup).bind(el.event, el.function ? eval('(' + el.function + ')' : self.commandHandler);
[02:39:42] <seutje> fuck, missing a paren lol
[02:40:05] <blackspotwiggins> cant you preload the functions beforehand?
[02:40:14] <wangdoo> angryasian: what is the solution?
[02:40:16] <seutje> no sir
[02:40:31] <blackspotwiggins> also, you can merge markup to the attributes
[02:40:32] <angryasian> I'm thinking! :o
[02:40:44] <seutje> oh, right
[02:40:46] <seutje> senks <3
[02:41:02] <blackspotwiggins> eval works on a global context
[02:41:03] <seutje> the event as well, right?
[02:41:29] <blackspotwiggins> yeah events as well
[02:44:29] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, would those functions repeat over time?
[02:44:38] <blackspotwiggins> i'd eval them into a global cache and use those
[02:44:52] <blackspotwiggins> but you'd need to fingerprint them somehow
[02:45:07] <seutje> no, only runs once
[02:45:28] <seutje> or wait, u mean the handlers?
[02:45:31] <blackspotwiggins> yeah
[02:45:40] <seutje> well yea
[02:45:47] <seutje> it's for controls for a wysiwyg
[02:45:47] <blackspotwiggins> if you get same handler twice, it would make sense to cache them
[02:45:53] <blackspotwiggins> as eval is also slowish
[02:45:54] <seutje> oooh like that
[02:46:10] <seutje> well, the eval only runs once per control element
[02:46:17] <blackspotwiggins> you'd need to specify a name tho
[02:46:24] <seutje> and I suppose some might end up having the same handler
[02:46:36] <seutje> but I have a default handler that handles most cases
[02:46:42] <blackspotwiggins> (cache[name] || createcache(name))
[02:46:55] <seutje> but stuff like a drop down list with wrapper element names... u'd have to supply ur own handler
[02:47:08] <seutje> or an image upload control
[02:47:20] <blackspotwiggins> i dont really understand why you cant preload tho
[02:48:20] <seutje> well, suppose I could, but then I'd have to have my backend write to a file and I suck at backend shit
[02:49:00] <seutje> I'ma go with this solution for now and look into optimizing it later
[02:49:06] <seutje> not a billable project anyway
[02:49:28] <jaypitidi> when I use $blah.html('<div></div>') then $blah.fadeOut() $blah.load() it will fade out my html() method before the load() method starts, how can I get it to fade out once the load() method is complete?
[02:50:08] <angryasian> wangdoo what do you want it to do on blur?
[02:50:33] <jaypitidi> it still didn't work angryasian.
[02:50:34] <seutje> jaypitidi: use the callback
[02:50:52] <angryasian> i thought you fixed it jay :o
[02:50:58] <jaypitidi> i did too :(
[02:51:00] <wangdoo> angryasian:  i have result,if i click a column,i should be able to input data
[02:51:21] <angryasian> ok
[02:51:38] <seutje> jaypitidi: $blah.html('<div>').fadeOut(function() { $(this).load(); });
[02:52:19] <angryasian> wangdoo why are you using unbind anyways?
[02:52:50] <jaypitidi> exactly, the div will just flash and it could take 10 seconds for the page to load. The div has a preloader so it should stay on screen while the page is loading
[02:53:06] <wangdoo> angryasian:  because that second click is removing the text right
[02:53:42] <angryasian> ah ok ill write you some code rq that'll fix your problems.  unbind here basically does nothing as live and unbind sort of cancel each other out.
[02:54:00] <wangdoo> angryasian:  okay
[02:54:33] <wangdoo> angryasian: I'm trying to doing tagging as the one in FB
[02:56:04] <seutje> ahh boo, u can't just append() an array of jquery objects? q.q
[02:57:41] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/7/
[02:57:45] <angryasian> wangdoo: here you go sir.
[02:57:58] <jayar> IE gives the error: Object doesnt support this property or method for this: $(function() {
[02:59:16] <jaypitidi> who me?
[02:59:22] <jaypitidi> seutje
[02:59:52] <wangdoo> angryasian: It's is working! but i need to add x symbol when some click x that particulat tag should be deleted.
[03:00:22] <angryasian> so... on click it shows input box and an X?
[03:01:04] <wangdoo> angryasian: it should get an ui and x.one tag ii have ui and x,if i click x ,it should be deleted
[03:01:34] <jayar> anyone?
[03:02:09] <wangdoo> angryasian: if i add one tag in a row,it is adding it toall rows
[03:04:05] <quicksilver> jayar: means you don't have jQuery lodaded.

[03:11:11] <angryasian> lol wangdoo timed out he'll never get the solutions to his problems now!
[03:11:26] <angryasian> a shame; since I did it :[
[03:14:46] <wangdoo> angryasian: when i add one tag,it's getting added to all rows
[03:14:57] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/8/
[03:14:59] <angryasian> ah you are baack
[03:15:03] <angryasian> i solved your issues
[03:15:39] <angryasian> I think you can pretty much take it from here.  That should be enough code for you to do whatever you need
[03:16:12] <wangdoo> angryasian: that row can be empty too so,if condtion
[03:16:33] <angryasian> then give your td's a width and then it'll work
[03:16:37] <angryasian> that's css' work
[03:17:17] <angryasian> what the code says is "when you click on the td" do something
[03:17:25] <wangdoo> angryasian: each tag should get x mark not the whole one
[03:17:27] <angryasian> if your td has no width then well you cant click on anything
[03:17:34] <wangdoo> angryasian: you can enter many tags
[03:18:19] <angryasian> you want all id="tag" to become text boxes?
[03:18:26] <angryasian> why dont you give it a try on your own for a bit :p
[03:18:45] <angryasian> .each() will help if thats what you're trying to do
[03:19:11] <wangdoo> angryasian: It is a result record,you click ona couln and enter as many tags,you want.each tag should have x mark
[03:19:55] <angryasian> well fsfsd doesnt have class tag on it
[03:19:58] <angryasian> so it wont get an X
[03:20:29] <angryasian> and using multiple id's on one page = bad
[03:21:15] <wangdoo> angryasian: in class =tag,you can enter name,address.now name ii have x and even address iii hv x
[03:23:21] <wangdoo> angryasian:  pls,help with this delete alone
[03:23:37] <Aamir> ?fadeto
[03:23:44] <Aamir> :/
[03:23:46] <angryasian> wangdoo I think you can adapt my code to do whatever now.  ill need a new jsfiddle with your new html structure to figure out what you want next.  so far it lets you edit a tr with one td
[03:24:44] <wangdoo> angryasian:  nope,you have added x for whole td,instead add it for input what you give.You would have seen tagging in many places,m trying to do the same
[03:24:58] <wangdoo> angryasian: thank you for what ever you have done
[03:26:35] <angryasian> ok well glad to help.  sorry I cant understand what you want next.
[03:27:37] <wangdoo> angryasian: let me explain it
[03:30:52] <wangdoo> angryasian: you could see name,you click and enter address,after that name should have x sybol and also address should have
[03:31:53] <angryasian> can you make me the html for whatever row you want?
[03:32:08] <angryasian> that'll speed things up greatly. I just want to see how an actual result is supposed to endup looking
[03:32:20] <Link-> hi guys, I'm trying to queue several animations that have to happen sequentially, and I don't have a specific object to queue them too, so I created an empty object and queued the animations to it. However the animations are executing directly after they are called and not after each completes..
[03:33:46] <Link-> http://pastebin.com/PUGsEEny << example code
[03:34:36] <stianhj> I have dropdown where a div isn't inside the li you hover to show it.. so when you leave the li the div hides, etc.. anyone have any tips?
[03:35:45] <wangdoo> angryasian:  see here http://jsfiddle.net/Ux6js/ first time,td ii have only name,i ii click and enter address ,after this it ii get x symbol bcoz i need to delete it.
[03:38:46] <Double_Rainbow> am i still here?
[03:39:27] <wangdoo> angryasian: understood.what i wnat?
[03:39:50] <angryasian> yes you're goign to have to do <tr><td>name</td><td>address</td></tr>
[03:39:57] <angryasian> for it to be useful to me
[03:39:59] <angryasian> btw
[03:41:29] <wangdoo> angryasian: small change,both name and affress,ii be in same td
[03:44:34] <angryasian> well if you want name and address to be in one td.  then yuo're goign to have to do a lot of heavy lifting which i dont want to do
[03:44:52] <angryasian> you're giong to have to parse things by spaces (or that x) and figure out whats the name and wharts the address
[03:45:04] <angryasian> then do the whole input box creation based on that
[03:45:13] <angryasian> and similarly the X functionality based on that
[03:45:32] <angryasian> its just a million times easier if you make it into TWO td's which would make sense as its a table
[03:45:35] <wangdoo> angryasian: yes,each data,you input ii have x
[03:46:21] <wangdoo> angryasian: may be one thing what we can do is after entering one word giving background css and x.this differe tags in it
[03:47:11] <angryasian> well i cant help you.  make your table and fill it with data like a normal person would.  then maybe we can work something out.  but just <tr><td>nameX addressX</td></tr> is ridiculous.  maybe someone here can argue/defend for either of us
[03:48:18] <angryasian> it'll be easier if its just <tr><td>nameX</td><td>addressX</td></tr> you have all the code you need here http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/8/ and i suggest you figure it out on your own
[03:50:41] <ckoekemoer> $.fx.step can anyone tell me what fx.step is?
[03:50:51] <ckoekemoer> and fx.now
[03:51:10] <angryasian> err  is it in a plugin?
[03:51:23] <angryasian> nvm
[03:52:18] <wangdoo> angryasian: have you seen tagging in facebook.that is what m trying to do
[03:52:42] <wangdoo> angryasian: here you add text,instead of click some one in photo
[03:53:30] <angryasian> yeah and if you'll notice evrey single person is in his/her own <span></span> on the bottom of the picture.  you cant just squish data together and expect it to be easily parsable afterwards
[03:54:20] <wangdoo> angryasian: i need to do it in td,no other go.
[03:54:29] <wangdoo> angryasian: what is the final solution?
[03:55:03] <angryasian> find someone else who wants to help you / change your html structure to something that makes sense / do it yourself with the code i've given you (which is moer than enough)
[03:56:30] <wangdoo> angryasian: can we do this.say a person enters and when he press spaceebar,we know what he previously typed is one full word,now apply css and x mark
[03:56:47] <angryasian> yeah you cant split on space.  that's bound to break
[03:57:07] <angryasian> is your name ONE word wangdoo?
[03:57:24] <angryasian> split on the X that makes atleast SOME sense
[03:58:08] <angryasian> and what if your address contains spaces and X's? you cant just have an X its got to be a link / button or something
[03:58:33] <angryasian> so you have to split your $('td').html() based on whatever element you chose to represent your close button
[03:58:46] <angryasian> then figure out if there an input box in there or just plain text
[03:59:18] <wangdoo> angryasian: now how to do the one you are telling
[04:00:42] <angryasian> I'm not doing your dirty work for you.  ask when you actually to do something and get stuck not for someone to do everything for you.  the jquery api is simple enough to read
[04:01:08] <wangdoo> angryasian: sorry to make you work on my problem but you have solved one problem,this should be easy
[04:01:17] <wangdoo> angryasian: calm down
[04:01:19] <angryasian> no shit. try it yourself
[04:01:24] <angryasian> dont anger the angry asian
[04:01:41] <wangdoo> angryasian: okay
[04:06:52] <coldhead> racist
[04:11:10] <angryasian> lol coldhead
[04:11:33] <angryasian> I just don't want to help if no effort is being put in from the other side.
[04:11:41] <angryasian> I understood the issues initially
[04:11:55] <angryasian> but I've given enough code for him to think about and develop further
[04:12:13] <angryasian> if he has a stalemate in the future then ill help him out
[04:19:58] <wangdoo> coldhead: Pessimist
[04:21:17] <sunscreen> heey all
[04:21:43] <coldhead> you again
[04:22:11] <sunscreen> http://stream.selectukradio.tk/shoutstats-0.8.4/?server=SelectUKradio.com <--I have a global array object that I assign from a $.get call back but it seems that it never updates the real one
[04:23:25] <dotwired> hi. does anyone know why i get this annoying error in IE < 8 when clicking on the "hide menu" link here: http://demo.bildervonfreunden.de/bvf1_html/ ?
[04:23:35] <sunscreen> curcpuspeed[x] = val; in the $.get callback is not the same var curcpuspeed new Array(); which is a global or so I thought
[04:24:08] <sunscreen> that a caveat of array
[04:24:27] <sunscreen> s/s
[04:25:31] <quicksilver> sunscreen: no, you are correct, that is global, or at least window-scoped
[04:26:17] <quicksilver> your problem is with axn
[04:26:31] <quicksilver> you are getting scope wrong there.
[04:27:06] <seutje> how do u call a function whilst determining the value of 'this' again?
[04:27:20] <quicksilver> http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/
[04:27:29] <quicksilver> sunscreen: ^^ read. internalise.
[04:27:37] <Shishire> seutje, functionName.call(thisObject, otherParams, otherParams, etc...)
[04:27:46] <quicksilver> seutje: call or apply
[04:27:55] <quicksilver> seutje: depending if you have args literally or in an array
[04:28:00] <seutje> aah, so the first arg is this
[04:28:03] <quicksilver> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[04:28:08] <quicksilver> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[04:28:29] <seutje> senku
[04:34:11] <dotwired> so, no idea why IE < got problems with this? $('nav').animate({'top': '-143px', 'height': 'auto'}, 250); this is the line which produces the error by the way… =(
[04:34:53] <wangdoo> angryasian:  see this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/13/.clcik name,then press spacebar,enter some data,then press enter.
[04:35:23] <wangdoo> angryasian: here it is applying background for the whole td but it should apply for each word.
[04:35:46] <quicksilver> dotwired: do we get to know what the error is? or is that a secret? :P
[04:36:46] <dotwired> just "line 18" in the jQuery 1.6.1 minified original source file
[04:37:12] <quicksilver> no error message? hmph.
[04:37:24] <dotwired> you can see if you go to http://demo.bildervonfreunden.de/bvf1_html/ and click on the "hide menu" link
[04:37:29] <wangdoo> angryasian: you there?
[04:38:22] <sunscreen> hrrm
[04:38:25] <quicksilver> dotwired: not really I can't, since it works fine on a mac.
[04:38:27] <dotwired> with IE > 9 only.
[04:38:50] <dotwired> all the other browsers do fine.
[04:39:17] <dotwired> äh i mean IE < 9… :P
[04:39:35] <sunscreen> so quicksilver  basically i need to put  a closure in my $.get callback
[04:44:49] <quicksilver> sunscreen: no.
[04:45:17] <quicksilver> sunscreen: you're already using a closure
[04:45:22] <quicksilver> like it or not :)
[04:45:41] <seutje> omg how evil!
[04:46:21] <quicksilver> but you need to put that central part in a function, either an anonymous local one or an outer one
[04:46:37] <quicksilver> to get a "seperate copy" of your loop variable.
[04:46:52] <quicksilver> OK, so the answer is kind of yes :)
[04:46:58] <quicksilver> to what you initially asked.
[04:47:15] <quicksilver> I just meant to point out you were already using one, but javascript didn't handle it quite the way you expected.
[04:47:22] <quicksilver> (or I expected, the first time I saw this problem)
[04:47:23] <sunscreen> ok
[05:05:40] <epure_> how does jquery implement .error() so that it works on window, in opera?
[05:07:32] <epure_> Just asking because I have this code: http://pastebin.com/rzGy6U2q  . My handler is not called in opera

[05:33:30] <nielsnick> Cork: true :)
[05:33:41] <seutje> lol finding a method named "canTag1WrapTag2" sorta made my day :')
[05:33:52] <Cork> lol
[05:34:02] <sunscreen> ok i got it going now i forgot to make my function like var callbackfn = function () { }
[05:34:02] <nielsnick> I have four different div's that look like this
[05:34:16] <sunscreen> but phpdata is not getting passed over now from $.get
[05:34:31] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/SFtq9hxS for some reason this isn't working, is my class selector formatted correctly?
[05:34:35] <nielsnick> <div class="gs-title"><a href=" ...." class="gs-title"></div>
[05:34:43] <Sean-Der> I have some fields that have that class
[05:34:54] <nielsnick> and I have to get the a href (the ...) in a php variable
[05:34:58] <seutje> sunscreen: no arguments?
[05:35:16] <seutje> nielsnick: uhm what?
[05:35:19] <nielsnick> but all the a's have the same class.. so no idea what to do
[05:35:20] <Sean-Der> Nver mind figured it out!
[05:35:31] <seutje> u wanna use clientside jquery to grab an href and store it in a variable in ur backend?
[05:35:46] <nielsnick> seutje: get the real ' link' as a variable and use it in php
[05:35:54] <molavy> any idea?
[05:35:56] <nielsnick> seutje: I don't know wether to use jQuery of PHP
[05:35:59] <nielsnick> or*
[05:36:48] <seutje> seems silly to do that on the clientside
[05:37:05] <Paganini> !silly
[05:37:17] <Paganini> damn, really thought that could have woked!
[05:37:23] <seutje> ?bot
[05:37:35] <seutje> bot-t taking some R&R
[05:37:49] <jayar> wtf... its not reading my script tag right

[05:37:54] <jayar> whats wrong with this?? <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[05:38:27] <seutje> nielsnick: are u running PHP on the clientside?
[05:38:33] <Cork> jayar: nothing
[05:38:37] <nielsnick> nope
[05:38:41] <jayar> well its giving an error, Cork
[05:38:43] <nielsnick> sorry
[05:38:45] <nielsnick> my mistake
[05:38:47] <seutje> so why the ass would u want this on the clientside?
[05:38:54] <Cork> jayar: whats the error?
[05:38:59] <jayar> jQuery is not defined
[05:39:02] <nielsnick> I don't know how to do this with php
[05:39:24] <seutje> time to get googling then
[05:39:31] <jayar> Message: 'jQuery' is undefined
[05:39:38] <jayar> Line: 10
[05:39:47] <Cork> jayar: is your site https?
[05:39:51] <trieuvan> helu
[05:39:53] <nielsnick> seutje: well. I tried, that's why I came here :)
[05:39:58] <jayar> nope
[05:40:15] <seutje> nielsnick: what parser u using?
[05:40:16] <sunscreen>      $.get(getstr, {  }, function(phpdata) { callbackget(phpdata,axn);  });
[05:41:10] <nielsnick> seutje: I don't use one?
[05:41:12] <sunscreen> this in var callbackget = function() { return function { alert(phpdata); } } return undefined
[05:41:21] <seutje> nielsnick: whoa, good luck then :|
[05:41:26] <sunscreen> returns undefined
[05:41:46] <Cork> jayar: check so something isn't removing the object
[05:42:12] <jayar> theres nothing on the page
[05:42:13] <Cork> jayar: and make sure you don't have a parser error before the script tag (that includes in the js files before)
[05:42:20] <seutje> jayar: is it preceded by broken markup?
[05:42:31] <jayar> it must be broken markup
[05:42:36] <seutje> fine Cork, just take the words out of my mouth, why don't u?
[05:42:45] <Cork> seutje :)
[05:43:17] <sunscreen> this in var callbackget = function(phpvar,myaxn) { return function { alert(phpdata); } } return undefined
[05:43:18] <sunscreen> even
[05:43:21] <Cork> jayar: w3c validate and jslint is good helps

[05:48:32] <seutje> lolapi
[05:48:57] <Zeddy> how do i use jquerys .css() to set multiple background images?
[05:49:10] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/2319558
[05:49:12] <Zeddy> this didn't work
[05:49:16] <seutje> jayar: doesn't for me... what version?
[05:49:17] <Zeddy> it just set the first value :(
[05:49:33] <Cork> Zeddy: .css('background-image', 'url(),url(),url(),url();'
[05:49:36] <jayar> 8.0
[05:50:23] <Cork> Zeddy: you have to make your code dependent on what rendering agent it is with that
[05:50:35] <Cork> Zeddy: as backgorund-image can only hold one value
[05:50:40] <seutje> yea, u can test for it using them 1 by 1
[05:50:49] <jayar> i give up, this is retarded
[05:50:52] <qwerty57> how do u do smth like this
[05:50:53] <qwerty57>  $(".show" || ".whatever").click(function () {
[05:50:54] <qwerty57> ?
[05:51:09] <molavy> i want detect when an object send ajax request and get response,because i want put it into array and while last response for that objects not received that object not allowed to send another request
[05:51:17] <erichynds> $(".show, .whatever").click()
[05:51:18] <Cork> Zeddy: best way is to add them in a css file and just adding the class instead
[05:51:23] <qwerty57> cooll thanks
[05:51:31] <Cork> Zeddy: that way you don't have to do all the manual testing
[05:52:11] <Zeddy> Cork, im trying to create a gradient mixer :F
[05:52:18] <Zeddy> using color pickers and an empty div
[05:52:31] <Zeddy> so the colors will be dynamic
[05:52:33] <Cork> Zeddy: ugg...
[05:52:36] <Zeddy> ^_^
[05:52:56] <Zeddy> so your telling me its not possible? :o
[05:52:57] <Cork> Zeddy: you could make a farly simple $.support.background test
[05:53:04] <Cork> Zeddy: it is
[05:53:26] <sunscreen> Ok this is hacking mee off now explain Why mcpucount ** a global ** is in scope for $.get callback but var curcpuspeed = new Array(); decalred at the same point and 'mcpucount' is some how different
[05:53:31] <Sean-Der> Is there a way I could do an event that when a class fails to exist do something? The selector would be blur body?
[05:53:40] <Zeddy> could i create a long string and just append it to the style attribute?
[05:54:16] <Cork> Zeddy: nope one mine i'll post an examplr
[05:54:18] <Cork> *le
[05:54:59] <Zeddy> thanks!
[05:55:17] <Zeddy> omfg im stupid
[05:55:26] <Zeddy> im replacing the object value background-image every time :D

[05:58:16] <Amit> I can not remove that. It is the code from server. It acts like vHTML.
[05:58:22] <sunscreen> Seriously what the fuck why did they  just not make the global stack available to the callback stack that why its GLOBAL
[05:58:25] <sunscreen> sheesh
[05:58:36] <Zeddy> nerd-rage detected
[05:58:44] <Amit> When the link is cliked, it open up the dailog box with three links.
[05:58:57] <Zeddy> you have a link to this page?
[05:59:08] <Zeddy> thats fugly coding if anything
[05:59:34] <Amit> No. Its internal. Can not be accessed from outside.
[05:59:46] <twoface> Hi. I am trying to catch some keydown's on a page, and it works fine. The problem is that i need to click inside the document to focus it, before i can catch e.g. 'down'. Can i make jquery focus the document? $(document).focus() doesn't do it.
[05:59:48] <Zeddy> allrighty then, how about source code? :p
[06:00:12] <sunscreen> and this integer that are global accessible and arrays that arnt how does this constitute a rational language
[06:00:21] <Amit> I can get that. But its a huge page and I am looking at only one small section.
[06:00:32] <Amit> Do you want me to send the code to you >
[06:00:41] <Zeddy> you could pastie the source code
[06:03:01] <Amit> ok. let me try.
[06:03:20] <Cork> Zeddy: http://jsfiddle.net/yF3ef/1/
[06:03:40] <Cork> Zeddy: that way you just have to do the test once
[06:04:08] * Cork just notised that many of the extra added line breaks is missing :s
[06:04:30] <Zeddy> holy crap, thanks :P
[06:04:34] <Cork> Zeddy: http://jsfiddle.net/yF3ef/3/
[06:04:36] <Cork> there better :)
[06:05:20] <Cork> Zeddy: $.support.backgroundLinearGradient will be false if linear gradient isn't supported by the browser
[06:05:21] <hariom> Hi, I have a series of checkboxes with the common css class 'students'. I want to get all the checkboxes that are checked. How to do that? I tried something like this: $('input.students :checked').val()
[06:05:21] <sean`> better off using native dom props for that
[06:05:55] <Zeddy> allrighty, Cork, thanks alot, works
[06:06:04] <Cork> yw
[06:07:14] <hariom> what is wrong in this:  $('input.students :checked').val()    I want to get all the checkbox values for which the class is students
[06:07:20] <bricker> Hey everybody… I have multiple forms on one page. How can I use jQuery to get the current form being typed in? $('input') is fine for one form. Each form has a unique, dynamically generated ID. I hope this makes sense, I am quite new to jquery
[06:08:00] <molavy> i want detect when an object send ajax request and get response,because i want put it into array and while last response for that objects not received that object not allowed to send another request
[06:08:42] <molavy> any idea?
[06:09:02] <hariom> bricker: get the id of a DOM element on keypress event. If the id belongs to form 1 dom elements, then your user is filling form 1
[06:10:06] <hariom> what is wrong in this:  $('input.students :checked').val()    I want to get all the checkbox values for which the class is students
[06:10:11] <Cork> bricker: or you can grab the from from $(this).closest('form')
[06:10:20] <Cork> *form from
[06:10:21] <Cork> XD
[06:10:44] <bricker> Cork: hariom: Thanks!
[06:14:18] <hariom> anybody? what is wrong in this:  $('input.students :checked').val()    I want to get all the checkbox values for which the class is students
[06:14:49] <hariom> How to get all the checkbox values for which the css class is students
[06:15:49] <nail_> thgat should be input.students:checked, and .val() only returns the value of the first element, so you probably want to use .map() to get them all
[06:17:33] <bricker> is there a way to have variables in strings without escaping? ("#"+form_id+" .submit") seems more verbose than is necessary...
[06:18:07] <Cork> bricker: nope thats how it works
[06:19:22] <bricker> Cork: okay! I am just getting into jQuery via Rails, so you can understand why I asked
[06:19:37] <bricker> thanks
[06:20:17] <nail_> there are sprintf implementations, or things like crockford's supplant though, but in the given case that won't save much
[06:20:21] <nail_> except maybe in clarity
[06:23:43] <bricker> I have to say, the jQuery API is one of the best I've ever used.
[06:24:03] <versatiletech> Briareos1: agreed
[06:24:06] <versatiletech> oops
[06:24:19] <Cork> bricker: ya i know
[06:24:19] <versatiletech> bricker: agreed. Darn tab autocompletion.
[06:24:42] <bricker> Veejay: yeah that thing never works
[06:25:11] <Cork> bricker: @dialog.html(<%= render({ :partial => 'form' }).to_json %>)
[06:25:14] <Cork> :D
[06:25:22] <Cork> opps wrong char
[06:25:27] <Cork> s/@/$/
[06:26:59] <molavy>  did you try create a function that run every time a element send ajax request and lock that while response not received
[06:27:17] <bricker> Cork :D haha
[06:28:30] <silverd> afternoon guys, has anyone every done anything with scaling up/down x & y coords based on image sizes?
[06:30:48] <jbrokc> $.append creates a new child to a given selector. How do I create a sibling instead?
[06:31:30] <molavy>  i want detect when an object send ajax request and get response,because i want put it into array and while last response for that objects not received that object not allowed to send another request
[06:31:54] <seutje> jbrokc: .before() or .after()
[06:31:59] <molavy> any idea?
[06:32:12] <seutje> molavy: I answerred that like an hour ago, didn't I?
[06:32:21] <jbrokc> seutje: thanks
[06:32:24] <seutje> answered is with 1 r, innit?
[06:33:25] <seutje> lemme try again, molavy: http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[06:33:56] <molavy> there is no answer there? how can i detect what object send request
[06:35:09] <seutje> "Highly User Interface Design" what does that even mean? o.O
[06:35:15] <sadmicrowave> molavy, what do you mean by 'object send ajax request'?
[06:35:19] <g0rd0n> i have a string 'foo_bar' how can i get what is behind the _, in this case just 'bar'?
[06:35:22] <jbrokc> does jquery have built in interpolation for templates? that is, '<li>#{array[0].text()}</li>' ?
[06:35:32] <jbrokc> or how do i do interpolation in jquery?
[06:35:49] <beasty> anyone using tinymce ?
[06:36:00] <beasty> oh and hi sean`
[06:37:02] <sean`> hi beakerma_
[06:37:04] <sean`> beasty
[06:37:05] <sean`> I use it
[06:37:10] <sadmicrowave> silverd, are you referring to the coords attribute of an <area> or something?
[06:37:33] <molavy>  i have some form and element that send ajax or $.post to server. i want disable each element that send request while response received
[06:37:44] <molavy> element ,Dom element like $.post inside a $("form").submit() event
[06:37:57] <beasty> sean`: do you know if there is a way that i can trigger a update ?
[06:38:06] <beasty> for instance i have a tinymce field
[06:38:08] <sean`> an update as in ?
[06:38:09] <beasty> i blur it
[06:38:18] <beasty> and then somthing like .change()
[06:38:23] <beasty> that gets the content ?
[06:38:24] <sean`> Yuo want to alter the conetent>?
[06:38:28] <seutje> OHAI sean` !
[06:38:31] <sean`> Or fetch the content
[06:38:43] <xtridence> Hello! I'm lookin' for slider-tutorial. I hope, this is okay. To be concrete: I'm lookin' something like a slider, but it shouldn't show only one image. I want to see at least directly and constantly 12 images, who should rotate everytime one image. like 1 2 3 4  - and then 2 3 4 5 :-) I'm new to this.
[06:38:56] <ejtues> ih
[06:38:57] <molavy> sadmicrowave ,any idea?
[06:39:09] <sean`> :p
[06:39:17] <sadmicrowave> molavy, if you use $.ajax() instead of $.post you can use a beforeSend: function(){ ... } and disable all the children of the form
[06:39:47] <Brodingo> ?jcarousel @ xtridence
[06:39:49] <beasty> sean`: fetch the content
[06:39:55] <Brodingo> >:|
[06:40:02] <Brodingo> BOT-T
[06:40:03] <sean`> seutje, will be in spa this weekend <3
[06:40:05] <silverd> sadmicrowave, yep, at the moment I have setup to record mouse clicks within a specific area (e.g. 500 x 300), but I would also look to plot these if the image|map|container were scaled up/down in the future
[06:40:05] <xtridence> Let me take a look - just a second.
[06:40:05] <sean`> love it
[06:40:11] <seutje> sean`: racing?
[06:40:28] <sean`> seutje, not myself unfortunately :p
[06:40:33] <sean`> client of mine is
[06:40:35] <molavy> how can i do this, how can detect what element send ajax request
[06:40:38] <molavy> ?
[06:40:41] <xtridence> Brodingo, by theory, it is like what I'm lookin' for.
[06:40:43] <quicksilver> molavy: you can't.
[06:40:54] <xtridence> Is there also a way, to let it slide automatically?
[06:40:55] <quicksilver> molavy: you'll have to write your own more clever ajax handler.
[06:40:56] <xtridence> I'm sure there is one.
[06:41:05] <quicksilver> molavy: (which calls jquery under the hood)
[06:41:06] <Brodingo> xtridence theres a lot of options available
[06:41:08] <xtridence> Ok
[06:41:11] <xtridence> Just found the autoscroll event
[06:41:13] <xtridence> Perfect.
[06:41:14] <Brodingo> and you can edit the css to your hearts content
[06:41:14] <xtridence> Much thanks.
[06:41:21] <xtridence> Agree with that.
[06:41:24] <sadmicrowave> silverd, I wanted to do a similar function by animating the <area> to be larger thereby resizing the coordinates on the fly..but I didn't know how to achieve this and was told it can't be done with <area>'s
[06:41:24] <xtridence> I'll do it.
[06:41:25] <xtridence> :)
[06:41:29] <Brodingo> yay
[06:42:24] <sean`> beasty, I think it's .execCommand ('getContent')
[06:42:26] <sadmicrowave> molavy, it doesn't sound like you need to detect which element sends the request...at least it doesn't sound like that from the way you asked your question....
[06:42:27] <sean`> sometng like that
[06:43:09] <sadmicrowave> molavy, you made it sound like you just want to disable all the elements of the form while your waiting for success of your ajax call...then re-enable the elements when you get the results
[06:43:35] <Paikahun> hey guys any one knows a good image rotate plugin?
[06:43:45] <sadmicrowave> .rotate
[06:43:51] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/qG6dbpxt For some reason this if statement causes my jQuery to stop working. What is wrong with my logic?
[06:43:59] <sean`> beasty, tinyMCE.activeEditor.getContent(s)
[06:43:59] <silverd> sadmicrowave, oki doki, thanks for chipping in :)
[06:44:20] <Paikahun> what is .rotate? is that even a function?
[06:44:21] <molavy> yes
[06:44:32] <sadmicrowave> silverd, let me know if you find a solution, I'd like to know how to resize my <area>'s if applicable
[06:44:33] <molavy> i want it was global
[06:44:51] <molavy> regardless of what form
[06:45:01] <sadmicrowave> molavy, so why do you keep asking how to detect what elements sends the request? those are two totally separate issues
[06:45:28] <silverd> sadmicrowave, will do, but for now I'll just look into how to scale the points using some good old maths!
[06:45:30] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, pastebin is slow today :/
[06:45:43] <sadmicrowave> silverd, whats math?
[06:46:00] <Sean-Der> Sorry should I use a different paste site?
[06:46:03] <molavy> no, i want each element that send request lock,just that element lock
[06:46:05] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, at least on my side
[06:46:36] <molavy> function global detect what element send request and disable it
[06:47:07] <sadmicrowave> molavy, figure out what you want and pose a question that is at least half way understandable before you ask because you keep asking for different things everytime you type
[06:47:21] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, no it just loaded hold on
[06:47:46] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, take out the ';' <- semi-colon in the if( )
[06:47:47] <Paikahun> ok i can see that rotate plugin
[06:47:49] <molavy> all of my question was same as last one
[06:47:55] <Paikahun> http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/
[06:48:03] <Sean-Der> Ohh Thank you!
[06:48:04] <Paikahun> but how do i rotate like +=90
[06:48:06] <Paikahun> ?
[06:48:09] <sadmicrowave> molavy, then maybe someone else that can understand you can help
[06:48:35] <molavy> ok, thank you anyway
[06:50:22] <seutje> molavy: html elements don't send XHR requests
[06:52:07] <molavy> yes , i know , but i want detect whom is event owner like this code:
[06:52:43] <molavy> $("form").submit(function(){$.post(....});
[06:52:53] <eml> Pathin: += 90? rotate(90)?
[06:52:57] <molavy> form is owner of $.post
[06:55:50] <beasty> fixed it
[06:55:52] <beasty> thanks sean

[07:36:07] <quicksilver> nezZario: not really jquery specific; it's just down the the keycodes in the browser event model
[07:36:07] <nezZario> Mononofu I'm fairly shitty with jQuery but afaik you'll need a plugin
[07:36:20] <quicksilver> nezZario: google for javascript keycodes.
[07:36:26] <phentges> nezZario, you can use a .keyup() to capture the keystroke then you just need .which property from the event object.
[07:36:30] <nezZario> quicksilver, I mean I know, but I was wondering if jQuery had something a little higher level to work with
[07:36:47] <nezZario> I can't get .keyPress() to recognize F7 which is what I wanted to capture anyway
[07:37:43] <quicksilver> nezZario: all jQuery does is paper over the inconsistencies between event.which and stuff
[07:37:49] <quicksilver> otherwise, you're on your own AFAIK.
[07:38:02] <nezZario> thanks for the tip..i'll google some more..

[07:56:04] <lduros> hello, I don't understand how I can set associative arrays in js, this is wrong: blah = [ 'img' => "2" ] but blah['img'] = 2 is fine -- is there another way to write it? Thanks
[07:56:47] <excellentdrums> blah = {img: '2'}
[07:57:26] <lduros> excellentdrums: aah got you :-) it's close to the way to write python dictionaries :-)
[07:57:34] <excellentdrums> yup.
[07:57:49] <lduros> i had used this before and then forgot. been doing too much php for a while :-)
[07:57:54] <lduros> excellentdrums: thanks! :-)
[07:57:59] <excellentdrums> blah.img = '2' also works

[08:11:51] <Aldus> Hi. I have <div id="#search-form"><div class="accordion">...  and I created the accordion with: $(".accordion").accordion({collapsible:true}); Now how can I expand / collapse it? I tried $("#search-form .accordion").accordion('activate',-1) and this collapses it... but how to expand?
[08:12:10] <gho5t> when i change an option on my plugin it doesn't appear to take effect. is there a way to call reinitialize() or something

[08:59:43] <xtridence> Brodingo?
[08:59:52] <xtridence> I've now implemented it on my site.
[09:00:00] <Brodingo> cool beans
[09:00:09] <xtridence> But I'm a little bit clueless. Where can I set the amount of images to be displayed?
[09:00:48] <xtridence> And something which is more important:
[09:00:53] <xtridence> I won't that it get to an finish.
[09:00:58] <xtridence> I wont that it makes the display circular.
[09:01:01] <xtridence> *want
[09:01:02] <xtridence> :-)
[09:01:12] <xtridence> Means, the first one should be displayed as next as the last one.
[09:01:14] <xtridence> a.e.
[09:01:20] <Brodingo> check the wrap option
[09:01:23] <Brodingo> wrap: circular
[09:01:39] <xtridence> let me see :-)
[09:01:41] <Brodingo> and as far as sizing thats up to your markup/css
[09:01:45] <rapta_> wow, i had a really hard time understanding anything you said
[09:01:49] <xtridence> well
[09:01:53] <xtridence> css isn't the problem
[09:01:56] <Brodingo> you get used to it rapta_
[09:02:23] <Brodingo> how else are you controlling the width and height of your carousel items
[09:02:26] <xtridence> Okay.
[09:02:32] <xtridence> It works fine.
[09:03:03] <xtridence> Now I must find out how to set up an higher amount of displayed images.
[09:03:07] <xtridence> This should be done in css?
[09:03:16] <xtridence> Or is there a predefined order which says: Actually only 3?
[09:03:24] <Brodingo> i guess so, either change the width of your container or shrink the items
[09:03:32] <xtridence> Okidoki.
[09:03:33] <xtridence> Let's try.
[09:03:53] <Brodingo> and yeah if you want it to scroll one at a time then use scroll: 1
[09:04:12] <xtridence> Hm.
[09:04:15] <xtridence> In the script I got
[09:04:32] <xtridence> there's just a jQuery('#mycarousel').jcarousel({auto:2, [......]
[09:04:51] <xtridence> Principally, what does the auto:2, means?
[09:05:12] <Brodingo> "Specifies how many seconds to periodically autoscroll the content. If set to 0 (default) then autoscrolling is turned off."
[09:06:12] <xtridence> Thank you :-)
[09:06:27] <Brodingo> youre welcome friend
[09:06:36] <xtridence> I know that I'm not that readful today.
[09:06:46] <xtridence> Because I just want to spice up my shop a little bit.
[09:06:50] <xtridence> But once I get time
[09:06:53] <xtridence> I'll introduce myself more into it.
[09:08:05] <Brodingo> once you understand it will be a red head to wash with dirty waters.. no problem enjoy
[09:17:19] <Aristata1> Hello, I have a form with a lot of different submit buttons with different names, I am using jquerys ajax method to do a PUT to the server, but the parameters are not reflecting my submit names like they do without ajax, anyone know a solution to this?
[09:23:34] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys
[09:30:47] <SilentPenguin> hmm, some of the code in the tmpl library is a bit, well, lets just say it could be better.
[09:31:35] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[09:31:38] <SilentPenguin> function (jQuery, undefined) { /* tmpl plugin code here */ }(jQuery); is probably my favourate
[09:33:02] <SilentPenguin> i'm guessing it gets a seal of approval from the redundancy department of redundancy
[09:35:07] <SilentPenguin> and a big thumbs up for using undefined, at least it is actually undefined
[09:35:50] <cbobo> if I have a <a href="stuff" body="more_stuff" /> and I would like to get the body part... I would simply do attr("body"); ?
[09:36:26] <sheepy> is the latest jQuery UI 1.8.14 or 1.8.15. I just downloaded .14 from jQuery UI site, but Google Ajax APIs has .15?
[09:37:29] <erichynds> cbobo: yaaapp
[09:38:51] <cbobo> okay, then if I have a class that gets a click function;; -> $('.clickme').click(function() { console.log(this.attr("body"); });
[09:38:54] <cbobo> should work right?
[09:41:01] <_psychic_> Instead of stopping an animation, is there a way to just overwrite it?
[09:42:04] <SilentPenguin> cbobo, assuming $('.clickme') is clickable, and console.log is defined (sometimes it isn't, *glares at IE*)
[09:42:36] <SilentPenguin> firefox won't either, but firebug will define it :/
[09:42:47] <SilentPenguin> fun times
[09:43:25] <cbobo> ya it is getting called
[09:43:31] <cbobo> it is clickable, and i am in FF
[09:43:39] <cbobo> just, it says; this.attr is not a function
[09:45:28] <SilentPenguin> the this being passed in the click callback is a dom object iirc
[09:46:25] <dabear> yup, use $(this).attr
[09:47:23] <cbobo> okay thanks, and I should just always use $(this) ? when inside of a .click .hover, etc function?
[09:47:45] <hoomi> I have a question about ajax callback...I am getting undefined  on success!
[09:47:49] <cbobo> When I tried just; this.body it worked fine
[09:48:47] <SilentPenguin> most things pass the dom element rather than a jquery object, one exception that springs to mind is when you write a plugin, but that makes perfect sense anyway
[09:49:03] <djQuery> anyone got a good tagger plugin? somethign that uses autocomplete to add multiple tags to an input
[09:50:25] <cbobo> okay makes sense to me know $(this) jq element; this. dom element =]
[09:50:49] <gnarf> djQuery: ummm
[09:50:59] <gnarf> djQuery: what kind of tags?
[09:51:03] <hoomi> This is my code if anyone wants to check...Please I need your guys help :)   http://pastie.org/private/phuzagamwgwu0kydavuvwa
[09:51:11] <cbobo> One more question, how slow is the Selector look up?  For example if I wanted to do something like $('#someid').html('stuff here'); and then do $('#someid').show();
[09:51:26] <djQuery> soemthing like this but with autocomplete for allready existing tags http://aehlke.github.com/tag-it/examples.html#graceful-degredation
[09:51:34] <datlap> Im creating nested tab using jquery tab. the parent tabs work fine. the nested tab however doesnt (var url=undefined in firebug). http://dpaste.com/586442/  anyone care to take a look
[09:52:31] <gnarf> djQuery: i'm 90% sure that mekwall has something along those lines on his github
[09:52:38] <hoomi> {"targ_mgr_uid":"hoomi ","src_mgr_uid":"hoomi "}  and this is what I am getting in the firebug
[09:52:59] <gnarf> djQuery: the one i wrote / use only uses the input for getting your tag choices, and then injects the tags into a separate div
[09:53:34] <sadmicrowave> I hate the DPS office :( - just spend 2 hours standing in a line in order to receive a number so I could be called at a later time.....efficient!
[09:53:57] <gnarf> djQuery: demo: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mcWnL/52/ repo: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-tagging
[09:54:12] <djQuery> gnarf: yeah I found it.
[09:54:32] <djQuery> doesnt seem to work though
[09:55:43] <gnarf> djQuery: the version i wrote.... *digs*
[09:56:13] <hoomi> Any help please ?
[09:57:10] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, whats the \ before $.ajax() for?
[09:57:33] <gnarf> djQuery: https://gist.github.com/abb125667e97406e32da
[09:58:12] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: This is because it is perl script so I have to skip the $
[09:58:13] <gnarf> djQuery: that gets called on a <div> which contains a hidden input which is the json representation of the tags
[09:58:15] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, also, try alert(data) by itself and see if data is found...at first glance it looks like your json structure within data might not be what you think it is
[09:58:44] <Sean-Der> I want to .load() a div any checkbox change on my page is it better to assign all checkbox's to a class or is there a selector for all checkboxs?
[09:59:04] <erichynds> $('[type="checkbox"]')
[09:59:11] <sadmicrowave> erichynds++
[09:59:30] <gnarf> input[type=...
[09:59:33] <Sean-Der> erichynds: Thank you can I use type= for radio etc...
[09:59:39] <gnarf> without the "input" you're wasting a lot of time
[09:59:39] <erichynds> yeah bro
[09:59:40] <Sean-Der> Yes I can!
[09:59:42] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: {"targ_mgr_uid":"hoomi ","src_mgr_uid":"hoomi "} this is what i am getting
[10:01:01] <sadmicrowave> hrmmmm
[10:01:15] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: So how can access to targ_mgr_uid ?
[10:01:42] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, it looks like you are doing it right
[10:01:44] <nascro> @sadmicrowave are you going to jQuery conf in October?
[10:02:00] <sadmicrowave> nascro, lol, where is it?
[10:03:07] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, try just alert(data.targ_mgr_uid) by itself
[10:03:14] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: undefined undefined this what i am getting back
[10:03:46] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: I have been trying different ways for 5 hours nothing is working !
[10:04:02] <nascro> @sadmicrowave why the laugh?
[10:04:16] <kborchers> nascro: just buy your ticket already ;)
[10:04:34] <sadmicrowave> nascro, because going to conf about jquery seems silly
[10:04:43] <nascro> @kborchers As if you had to pony money for your ticket? ;)
[10:04:47] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: why is that?
[10:04:50] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, perhaps its the \$. thats throwing it off....I'm not sure
[10:04:52] <nascro> @kborchers why?
[10:04:58] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, not sure...just does
[10:05:29] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, plus, I doubt it is anywhere close to my location...and I"m not buying a plane ticket to go to it
[10:05:36] <sadmicrowave> which is why I asked where it is
[10:05:50] <_psychic_> Does anyone know the best way to change the target end value of an animation smoothly?
[10:05:54] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: I take that off "\" I will get error msg!
[10:05:55] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: not sure what is silly about seeing presentations on the latest and greatest things done with jQuery and making contacts with lots of really smart people
[10:05:58] <kborchers> it's in boston
[10:06:11] <sadmicrowave> hoomi, I understand you will get an error....which is why I'm out of ideas...
[10:06:22] <johnl> having a bit of a problem with jquery autocomplete acting quite erratically. as I type quickly, it runs loads of concurrent ajax calls which all complete at different times and overwriting what I'm writing into the input box. anyone seen this?
[10:06:28] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, well when you put it like that
[10:06:30] <johnl> getting it on latest jqueryui master from github
[10:06:34] <nascro> @kborchers my son's second birthday is on the first...
[10:06:48] <kborchers> nascro: ouch
[10:07:00] <hoomi> sadmicrowave: Thanks for help :)
[10:07:05] <nascro> @kborchers Yeah, not sure how I'll swing it. Want to be there.
[10:07:07] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, are you going?
[10:07:08] <hariom> I am creating confirm dialog box using confirm('.... ') but I see that there appears a checkbox with the text as 'Prevent this page from creating dialog box'
[10:07:41] <hariom> how to remove that checkbox and text /
[10:07:41] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yes
[10:08:04] <kborchers> though, i have to admit i don't have to pay for it which makes it a lot easier
[10:08:13] <droptimize> hariom, it's because older browsers used to freeze in a loop on confirms/alerts
[10:08:29] <johnl> disabling autoFocus fixes it
[10:08:42] <hariom> droptimize: I know that. But how to avoid it ?
[10:08:49] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, no joke...the schedule looks good though
[10:08:56] <hoomi> Any help I am getting undefined on sucess   http://pastie.org/private/phuzagamwgwu0kydavuvwa
[10:08:59] <droptimize> don't send the DOM 8,000 alerts ;)
[10:09:16] <hariom> droptimize: I guess it is just after 10+ dialogs
[10:09:35] <hariom> My page is an interactive web app so I need to show the dialog to take confirmations
[10:09:38] <droptimize> or even less.. chrome does it in a just a few
[10:09:53] <sadmicrowave> I see john resig is a speaker but I don't see what he will be presenting...
[10:09:59] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yes it does ... you had the chance to go for free as well ;) http://rewardjs.com
[10:10:11] <droptimize> could you possibly do some other form of confirmation? or create your own dialog and use that
[10:10:36] <nascro> @sadmicrowave some of the sessions, IIRC, aren't defined yet.
[10:10:48] <sadmicrowave> oh ok
[10:10:48] <nascro> @sadmicrowave including John's
[10:10:53] <droptimize> hariom, i'm sure it's a setting in their browser
[10:12:36] <g0rd0n> hi there!
[10:12:54] <hariom> droptimize: yea, I tried it in about:config; but the end user won't be knowing what he needs and why he needs to do that.
[10:13:05] <g0rd0n> i have a <div> full of images, and i just want those images to endlessly scroll horizontally... is there any plugin you can recommend?
[10:13:12] <droptimize> yeah, i don't believe there is a work around
[10:13:35] <hariom> droptimize: thats very bad.
[10:13:50] <droptimize> do they have to confirm things constantly in your app, or could you present them with a list of checkboxes?
[10:13:50] <hariom> droptimize: how about using jquery dialogs?
[10:13:59] <droptimize> that's what I suggested
[10:14:13] <gnarf> john's prolly giving a keynote
[10:14:36] <droptimize> and if you set "modal:true" then it will behave much like the confirm you're used to
[10:14:39] <hariom> droptimize: app requires them to confirm few steps and then the ajax response asks some other questions and again they need to confirm. Its a cycle.
[10:16:21] * gnarf wonders why scott & timmy beat the alphabetization on that speakers page.... ajpiano? :)
[10:17:21] <gnarf> woah, eddie's giving a talk? :)
[10:18:33] <nascro> @gnarf re: alphabetization good catch
[10:19:15] <kborchers> gnarf's just mad cuz scott's ahead of him ;)
[10:19:43] <nascro> @gnarf seriously, though, why is that? is that list not created ss?
[10:20:02] <gnarf> nascro: my thought would be they didn't confirm their speaking until after someone already created that html
[10:20:15] <gnarf> then they confirmed and whoever added them was too lazy to insert sort
[10:21:04] <hoomi> Any helpp please ?

[10:27:39] <brettgolding> Hi anyone have any experience with the jParallax plugin for jQuery
[10:27:42] <kborchers> fabiobik: np
[10:27:55] <murtada> hey guys, I am trying to figure out how to use firebug to see what is being passed in an ajax multipage form- any ideas?
[10:28:23] <phlp> ?js "('" + "string1,string2,string3".split(',').join("'),('") + "')"
[10:28:24] <bot-t> phlp: "('string1'),('string2'),('string3')"

[10:28:34] <brettgolding> really need some help here
[10:28:37] <kborchers> zoned: what database? doesn't your db support importing csv's?
[10:29:28] <zoned> i have a table with 1 column, and a flat text file with a long list of values separated by commas. i choose import csv, and it says 0 rows inserted. not sure what i'm missing?
[10:29:50] <zoned> it's just a standard mysql db, using phpmyadmin
[10:30:00] <kborchers> replace your commas with line breaks
[10:30:19] <kborchers> or tell the import tool that , is the row delimiter
[10:30:40] <zoned> "fields terminated by"
[10:30:46] <zoned> i should put a , there ?
[10:31:09] <zoned> or "lines terminated by"
[10:31:14] <kborchers> zoned: no, i think that's the default right? that is how you separate fields in a single row
[10:31:24] <kborchers> lines, yes
[10:31:35] <kborchers> put a comma there
[10:32:00] <brettgolding> No one has no input on the jParallax plugin?

[10:45:52] <Shishire> wesada, try giving them explicit array keys (archiveItems[0], archiveItems[1], etc.).  If that makes it work, then it's probably an issue involving duplicated names.  While annoying, there are ways around it.

[10:57:00] <watermark> zoned: probably belongs in the php channel
[10:57:01] <snover> zoned: nobody will help you until you start using parameterised queries
[10:57:05] <kossakov> Brodingo http://goo.gl/2bY5V could you explain why it does? alert on every refresh, while no reaction on actual click
[10:57:26] <Sean-Der> Last question I have been looping through and getting .val() for fields it works great except sometimes in the situation where  a field isn't there it takes everything to a NaN. Is there an easy fix?
[10:57:32] <zoned> snover, there's one parameter, it's such a ridiculously simple query. does that really matter?
[10:57:51] <kossakov> wait, no alert here, anyway, previously was alert, any time i refresh
[10:58:12] <Brodingo> kossakov i dont see any click handlers ?
[10:58:29] <zoned> i just need something to take the $result from mysql_query and put it into the correct json format. i have no clue how to do that?
[10:58:35] <kossakov> :P not this paste ;)
[10:59:09] <grom> zoned in php?
[10:59:13] <zoned> yeah
[10:59:30] <kossakov> http://goo.gl/9BqGJ this

[10:59:42] <grom> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[10:59:43] <snover> http://bobby-tables.com/
[10:59:44] <phlp> zoned: your case is exactly when it matters. throwing user input directly into a sql string
[11:00:03] <grom> echo json_encode($result);
[11:00:14] <zoned> before i do that i have an anti injection function
[11:00:20] <zoned> called on the user input
[11:00:23] <Brodingo> kossakov need to pass a function
[11:00:31] <Brodingo> maybe
[11:00:46] <Brodingo> yeah i think so
[11:01:16] <Brodingo> kossakov wrap the alert in a function or else it just executes on page load
[11:01:28] <snover> zoned: WRONG.
[11:01:34] <kossakov> oO works ;) i don't know why, i tried with function, and it didn't work then ;)

[11:01:47] <Brodingo> oookayyy
[11:01:50] <snover> I cannot be any clearer than that.
[11:01:57] <snover> “Don't try to escape invalid characters. Don't try to do it yourself. Learn how to use parameterized statements. Always, every single time.”
[11:02:30] <zoned> snover: as i said, i run all user input through a function that strips all that out.
[11:02:55] <zoned> just because i'm not using ? syntax doesn't mean it's wrong?
[11:03:11] <snover> zoned: As I said, *don’t try to do it yourself*.
[11:03:54] <wesada> I've even tried wrapping the table in a form element prior to submit.
[11:04:03] <Sean-Der> When you get a .val() on a non existant field it return NaN. Is there a way for it to return nothing at all? Or could I do a if else (if returns Null don't add?)
[11:05:07] <snover> whatever you have done to “strip” data is A. almost certainly wrong and B. far more complicated than just using parameterised queries.
[11:05:12] <muay-guy> hello everyone. I'm playing around with the UI and I would like to know how to addClass on click (on an accordion object), and then remove the added class when it's clicked again

[11:05:34] <watermark> zoned: snover is right that parameterized statements are better, but the mysqli->escape_string() works too
[11:05:43] <snover> watermark: NO.
[11:05:44] <zoned> watermark, that's what i'm using^^
[11:05:45] <snover> WRONG.
[11:05:46] <watermark> let the battle begin!
[11:05:49] <zoned> uh oh.
[11:05:52] <muay-guy> doesn't really do the trick though
[11:06:04] <snover> Parameterised queries. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
[11:06:19] <watermark> what if your version of php doesn't support PDO?
[11:06:47] <snover> watermark: Then you are using a version of PHP that is end-of-life and riddled with other security vulnerabilities
[11:06:58] <Sean-Der> Can \\S* be used as a wildcard in jQuery?
[11:07:44] <zoned> snover, watermark, i plan on changing it to use parameterized statements. but, for the mean time, can anyone help me writing a function to take the $result and putting it into this json array i need? i know i need to use json encode, but i can't figure out what array to pass json_encode?
[11:08:00] <snover> zoned: parameterised statements first.

[11:12:39] <g4hsean> hi everyone! anyone in here know what functions i could use while working with XML using Jquery?

[11:13:15] <zoned> grom: i have a foreach($row as $key => $value) ... but the problem is the first thing item has to be the 'query' and i don't know how to insert that into the array?
[11:13:16] <Sean-Der> $('.phone*qty').length is that the correct selector to get all of the following classes? phone1qty phone2qty phone3qty
[11:13:16] <grom> zoned: then use json_encode($resultArray);
[11:13:48] <Sean-Der> use a return to get your variable back from PHP?
[11:13:55] <Sean-Der> return $myStatement?
[11:14:07] <grom> foreach($row as $key => $value)
[11:14:12] <sparkles_> why does jquery split an ajax parameter that's a list into multiple keys like foo[] ?
[11:14:14] <grom> foreach($row as $key => $value){
[11:14:15] <g4hsean> looking for someone who can point me to the JQuery functions that work on XML files
[11:14:28] <sparkles_> instead of foo=[1,2,3]
[11:14:38] <grom> $resArr[$key] = $value;
[11:14:54] <g4hsean> i loaded the XML to variable now i just need to find elements then add the required info to them to send to another page
[11:15:45] <zoned> grom here's a better explanation: http://pastebin.com/1NkLBcVg
[11:15:49] <zoned> and thanks :)
[11:16:27] <grom> yes
[11:16:40] <zoned> read the comments at the bottom
[11:17:05] <g4hsean> zoned you know anything about the functions used on XML files?
[11:17:34] <zoned> g4hsean i don't think i understand the question
[11:17:45] <zoned> when did we start talking about XML
[11:17:51] <bambang> do u have free manual books of jquery.. sorry i'm newbie
[11:18:24] <Brodingo> ?jqf @ bamband
[11:18:24] <zoned> g4hsean jQuery.parseXML() ?
[11:18:25] <bot-t> bamband, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:18:29] <g4hsean> zoned ive loaded an XML file using JQuery ajax. now i am looking for elements with specific names to add values to the elements
[11:18:31] <Brodingo> bambang ^
[11:19:03] <phlp> g4hsean: $(xml).find('node').text('foo')
[11:19:25] <g4hsean> zoned nah i am doing it via ajax. i load the file into a variable which i then proceed to use JQuery to find and add values to the elements
[11:19:29] <bambang> thx ,. i'll try
[11:19:46] <g4hsean> phlp ok ive gotten that far. but i am looking for a list of functions i could use on XML
[11:20:27] <g4hsean> phlp like here http://api.jquery.com
[11:20:39] <bambang> i've a question, what any process that ajax can do while jquery can't??
[11:20:57] <g4hsean> phlp i cant for the life of me find a list of functions which deals with XML either than $.parseXML
[11:20:58] <callumacrae> Why is .text removing spaces?
[11:21:13] <zoned> g4hsean anything i've ever read about jquery/xml states to first call jQuery.parseXML
[11:21:16] <callumacrae> $(el).text('test (1)') sets the text to "test(1)"
[11:22:06] <g4hsean> zoned yeah i've read a lot about that too. but using ajax to load XML from file supposedly already auto parses it to XML if its well formed
[11:22:15] <zoned> ahh
[11:22:39] <ravenzz> callumacrae ? http://jsfiddle.net/gafN2/
[11:22:58] <zoned> then can't you just call like $(xml).find("element")
[11:22:59] * callumacrae blinks
[11:23:17] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: It could be your font that just makes it appear like that?
[11:23:26] <zoned> if it's already parsed, then your data element should be your already-parsed xml object??
[11:23:33] <zoned> g4hsean^
[11:23:36] <g4hsean> zoned i mean i have got the XML file loaded and it is treated as XML by JQuery. now all i am looking for are the functions that will work with the XML. I try and use filter to find specific elements but that doesnt work so i have to use the $(xml).find("element_name")
[11:23:53] <grom> zoned: yes
[11:24:02] <ViicT> Hi, when I hit the back button (and get to the firstPage again) it show only  a blank screen when it should show firstPage, anyone had this problem?

[11:24:32] <zoned> jquery api doesn't have much except for that .find it looks like

[11:24:50] <ravenzz> ViicT with back button you mean the browser's one?
[11:25:14] <ViicT> ravenzz: jquery mobile one
[11:25:20] <phlp> g4hsean: filter probably will work but to start out the root item will be selected. filter reduces what is selected so if anything you will be left with nothing
[11:25:21] <wesada> Can I serialize form data for a non ajax form submission?
[11:25:24] <ViicT> will try to create a demo
[11:25:38] <g4hsean> zoned ok at least i know that i need to extend JQuery to add the functionality that i needed. I just thought there was a list of functions for XML that i did not know about

Anyone still using PHP4 is stupid and insane, since if the code is so bad it isn’t runnable in PHP5 that is probably because they were doing other stupid worst practices shit like not using parameterised queries. Also, talking about this in one sentence and then telling someone to use json_encode in the next sentence is interestingly paradoxical since json_encode doesn’t exist for PHP versions <5.1

[11:52:09] <xtridence> Everything is fine.
[11:52:15] <xtridence> I've integrated it and it's beautiful.
[11:52:28] <xtridence> But actually, it switchs in the horizontal way everytime 3 pictures.
[11:52:33] <xtridence> or better I should say: Items.
[11:52:37] <xtridence> How to set this to 1?
[11:52:50] <eddiemonge> mandric: event object?
[11:53:29] <mandric> sorry, you mean event is a global object?
[11:53:42] <phlp> keystr0k: $('fieldset').not('fieldset fieldset')
[11:54:06] <keystr0k> phlp: that may just do it :)   I realized .children() didn't help b/c the field sets aren't immediate children.
[11:54:07] <mandric> basically i have an event handler and i just want to reference a jquery event object as opposed to the browser event object from within the handler.
[11:54:20] <mandric> so that i have a standard api
[11:54:27] <mandric> err, consistent
[11:55:09] <eddiemonge> mandric: lets start with your original problem. what is it you want to do? and dont use "event object"
[11:56:11] <keystr0k> darn.   this doesn't work: $(element).find("fieldset").not("fieldset fieldset");
[11:56:54] <phlp> it should
[11:57:13] <keystr0k> yeah, the size() of the result is 0.
[11:57:14] <keystr0k> weird.
[11:57:25] <phlp> what is element
[11:57:41] <skapism> This is may be not a jquery-specific question, but may someone has a hint. I have a url like index.php#somequerystring ; now, when I click around in my site, stuff gets loaded with ajax, but when I pass this url to someone, I have to load the static part of a page and wait for my container to be ready to load 'querystring' into it. This results in the static part of the page being loaded immediately and the dynamic part (querystring) some one second 
[11:57:51] <skapism> More info here, if my question isn't clear: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3778636/is-there-a-way-to-ajax-load-a-page-and-change-url-in-url-bar-without-hashing
[11:58:02] <keystr0k> $this
[11:58:07] <keystr0k> (someone else's script.
[11:58:24] <keystr0k> basically, I need to get the top level field sets within $(this)
[11:58:38] <keystr0k> but they may be nested within a few divs
[11:59:00] <skapism> I checked sites that have problem, twitter for example postloads the dynamic content, it doesn't seem to bother them
[11:59:04] <skapism> the problem*
[12:00:45] <jugstah> guess i'll go post my question on stackoverflow :-0
[12:00:46] <phlp> keystr0k: http://jsfiddle.net/CYYm8
[12:00:51] <skapism> I realise there is no easy way to solve this, particularily because the webserver doesn't see the part after #
[12:01:12] <keystr0k> phlp: wow. thanks!
[12:01:25] <keystr0k> Maybe there's something wrong in my element hierarchy.
[12:01:45] <skapism> I mean, I could redirect to the actual page and have index.php?querystring, but then any subsequent clicks would look ugly, in the form index.php?querystring#secondquerystring
[12:02:01] <keystr0k> oh man… yeah… JUST found it… the second field set wasn't actually a child of the first :(  sorry abut that. Thanks for helping… your solution should work just fine.
[12:02:02] <xtridence> Brodingo: Is there something which needs to be changed at the *.js?
[12:02:32] <Brodingo> xtridence in your options set scroll to 1
[12:03:11] <xtridence> Just a sec.
[12:04:26] <xtridence> I've pasted the code for you in a query.
[12:04:29] <murtada> hey guys, how do I remove an index / item from an array
[12:04:39] <xtridence> Principally, in the code which I've integrated, there is no scroll option given.
[12:06:24] <phlp> codeshah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[12:07:11] <codeshah> phlp: oh, k, so splice(index,1) would do...
[12:07:20] <phlp> yep
[12:07:32] <PhanLord1> did anyone noticed that sortable conneting 2 lists, dragging stops working if one of the lists gets empty
[12:07:46] <Brodingo> xtridence in your jcarousel call
[12:07:47] <PhanLord1> you have to have at least one element in a list to be able to drag to it
[12:08:03] <Brodingo> one of the options should be scroll: 1
[12:08:06] <PhanLord1> ups :)
[12:08:11] <PhanLord1> ther eis a solution for that i guess
[12:08:12] <PhanLord1> :)
[12:08:30] <tjholowaychuk> how do you get jquery to parse the json response..
[12:08:43] <tjholowaychuk> via $.ajax()
[12:09:01] <PhanLord1> i guess even sample is not working :)
[12:09:17] <PhanLord1> oh it does
[12:09:17] <PhanLord1> :)
[12:09:27] <jugstah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6947179
[12:09:51] <phlp> tjholowaychuk: dataType:'json'
[12:10:17] <tjholowaychuk> do i have to respond with text/json? the docs are confusing
[12:10:20] <tjholowaychuk> and the api is confusing
[12:11:04] <tjholowaychuk> hmm not seeing any object on the xhr
[12:11:42] <phlp> data in success is the json object
[12:11:51] <xtridence>  Wonderfull
[12:11:54] <xtridence> Thanks Brodingo.
[12:11:55] <xtridence> It's done.
[12:12:12] <tjholowaychuk> why doesn't it just check the content-type and give you res.body or something
[12:12:19] <Brodingo> cheers
[12:12:21] <tjholowaychuk> phlp: I have .error(function(res){ ... res.data?
[12:13:04] <phlp> the docs say "If [no dataType] is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response"
[12:14:34] <tjholowaychuk> im not seeing the object anywhere
[12:14:49] <phlp> it wont be in error since there was an error
[12:15:07] <tjholowaychuk> :s
[12:15:12] <tjholowaychuk> it's just a status code
[12:15:26] <phlp> res.responseText
[12:15:33] <tjholowaychuk> right on
[12:21:02] <watermark> so, anyone know why Google CDN is serving jqueryui 1.8.15?
[12:21:25] <skapism> anyone has any idea as to my question?
[12:24:39] <datlap> The parent tabs are fine but nested tab (transfer button)  is not working. I m using jquery tabs. Any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/NwcYE/
[12:25:03] <phlp> watermark: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/milestone/1.8.15
[12:25:06] <codeshah> how do I add a <li> element to an ul container using jQuery? and then in that li add an input element... I am trying .add('li')
[12:25:21] <codeshah> can I build the li element with tne input element in it first?
[12:25:34] <s34n> What's the best way to make ui-accordion-header keep the ui-state-default look instead of the ui-state-active look when it is active?
[12:27:04] <watermark> well, 1.8.15 breaks in my (very simple) code.  I bet they don't release it.
[12:32:26] <magcius> does jQuery have a way to get a cookie value?
[12:32:41] <kossakov> http://pastebin.com/3PUkGTki :/ why this does not work?
[12:33:06] <jY> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[12:34:01] <magcius> jY, thanks!
[12:34:40] <k_89> hi ... can someone tell me how to check if the browser is internet explorer? I have tried $.support.leadingWhiteSpace but that doesn't work, any other idea
[12:35:01] <kossakov> array.push(val) is valid syntax, isn't it?
[12:35:29] <ryanneufeld> k_89: the user agent string
[12:35:30] <phlp> kossakov: try alert(zdjecia_ar.length)
[12:35:48] <ryanneufeld> k_89: you really shouldn't do browser detection, instead use feature detection
[12:35:50] <kossakov> phpl undefied
[12:35:55] <tjholowaychuk> i dont get why jquery considers 5xx to be some special thing
[12:35:59] <ccmonster> hey guys, I want to hide a div that has a bunch of stuff that renders on load via js (buttons form stuff etc), and I want to hide it, but then on completion, become visible. I am having trouble finding the right method to do that.
[12:36:04] <tjholowaychuk> it's just a response :s
[12:36:07] <jY> k_89, $.browser.msie
[12:36:17] <jY> if it's defined.. you have IE
[12:36:41] <phlp> tjholowaychuk: you mean status code?
[12:36:49] <tjholowaychuk> yeah
[12:36:54] <tjholowaychuk> why treat it differently
[12:37:12] <phlp> because it is meant to signal an error. that's the whole point
[12:37:21] <Shishire> tjholowaychuk, usually because it's not a problem that can be fixed by javascript.
[12:37:28] <kossakov> http://pastebin.com/Fs1fqmwM this is whole fragment, first each loop works, second doesn't
[12:37:47] <k_89> ryanneufeld, i need to do that as i need to prevent an animation from running on ie as its alpha filters mess up png's,  Also , i chaecked $.browser, jy, but its gonna be deprecated so i am trying to avoid using it
[12:37:54] <Shishire> 5xx means it's a server error, as opposed to 4xx which can be fixed by javascript correcting what it's sending.
[12:38:35] <codeshah> can I have a jquery.bind within another jquery bind? I am dynaically crateing checkboxes within a bind, and want to bind items to that
[12:38:39] <tjholowaychuk> it's just awkward to not have lower level access to the request api
[12:38:54] <tjholowaychuk> i cant even build a nicer api around this one
[12:38:57] <ajpiano> tjholowaychuk: i think we're adding back in a mechansim to get the *real* xhr
[12:38:58] <tjholowaychuk> because it gives you one level of api
[12:39:03] <ajpiano> let me see if i can find the ticket
[12:39:13] <tjholowaychuk> and it's a super awkward one
[12:39:23] <tdignan> How do I prevent the jquery validation plugin from allowing the browser to submit the form?
[12:39:36] <tdignan> I am trying to use it with the ajax form plugin.
[12:40:00] <mister> is there something like .toLowecase but that transforms text with tilde's to normal text?
[12:40:14] <mister> *.toLowerCase();
[12:40:29] <Shishire> mister, you mean like converting utf-8 text to ascii?
[12:41:10] <mister> Shishire: yeah!
[12:41:31] <mister> I'm using quicksand.js to sort some stuff, but some of the texts have special characters :/
[12:41:41] <tjholowaychuk> Shishire 4xx doesn't seem to parse the json either
[12:42:03] <tjholowaychuk> so if you have some kind of request error, you have to { error: msg } with 2xx? :s
[12:42:40] <brettgolding> Anyone in here ever used the plugin jParallax
[12:42:47] <ccmonster> anyone? When I do a div.hide() and then create my buttons (including using position from the jquery-ui) and then show, the positioning is WAY off, but if i dont hide first, it's correct. Why is that?
[12:42:49] <brettgolding> I am trying to implement it but having some trouble
[12:43:06] <brettgolding> I have a jsFiddle if someone can take a quick look for me would be much appreciated
[12:43:07] <ajpiano> tjholowaychuk: you can register a callback for any statuscode, or ... well have you seen this page? http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[12:43:12] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: because when its hidden it has no position?
[12:43:33] <kossakov> (ok, got this, nvm)
[12:43:33] <brettgolding> http://jsfiddle.net/theplastickid/5qabG/
[12:43:46] <brettgolding> hopefully someone can see where I am going wrong
[12:45:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[12:45:13] <ccmonster> so how do i hide it correctly, render the buttons and form, then show once it's a unified piece?
[12:45:18] <ccmonster> what's the best approach there.
[12:45:40] <brettgolding> anyone
[12:45:41] <brettgolding> ?
[12:50:27] <smit> can anyone help me with a conflict problem please ?
[12:51:43] <smit> or maybe the order of loading scripts ?
[12:52:18] <smit> http://www.carposy.com/CarPosySets.php
[12:53:14] <smit> trying to load jquery and fancybox and reelslideshow.js ... seems i can have 2 of the 3
[12:53:52] <tbranyen> kind of a weird question, i have a scoped version of jQuery to a given context
[12:53:59] <tbranyen> $ = function(selector) { return ql.libs.jQuery(selector, "#content"); }
[12:54:02] <tbranyen> something like that
[12:54:09] <tbranyen> how can i replace all the html inside that scope?
[12:54:20] <tbranyen> so that <div id="content">..</div> can be replaceable?
[12:54:54] <tbranyen> not sure its possible :-/
[12:55:10] <tbranyen> without grabbing the first element and then doing .parent()
[12:56:09] <ajpiano> tbranyen: replaceWith ?
[12:56:20] <tbranyen> yeah but what would the selector be?
[12:56:35] <ajpiano> oh gawd
[12:56:37] <tbranyen> like with that code i can do $("ul") and ensure its under #content
[12:56:43] <tbranyen> all the time
[12:56:45] <tbranyen> which owns
[12:56:52] <ajpiano> you're using a stringy context ?
[12:56:53] <ajpiano> ew
[12:56:59] <tbranyen> it can be whatever i guess
[12:57:15] <ajpiano> hmm
[12:57:18] <tbranyen> so you think if i have a reference i can just use that instead like $(root).html(
[12:57:25] <tbranyen> although that won't work if $ is scoped :-/
[12:57:26] <ajpiano> yah that's what id do
[12:57:32] <tbranyen> it'll look for that id under the id
[12:57:38] <ajpiano> not sure, didn't really see the whole "scoped" part initially
[12:57:38] <ajpiano> lol
[12:57:40] <tbranyen> jQuery should have a root
[12:57:44] <tbranyen> method
[12:57:50] <tbranyen> $().root or something i dunno
[12:57:56] <tbranyen> someone smarter than me figure it out :D
[12:59:48] <tbranyen> ah shit ajpiano i since i'm modding my own copy i can just attach my own property
[12:59:51] <tbranyen> $.root or something
[12:59:55] <tbranyen> since i'm*
[13:00:13] <ajpiano> that's kinda what i was thinking was just to orient your scope thing to have some convience stuff
[13:00:14] <ajpiano> lol vague
[13:02:01] <eddiemonge> isnt your $ not referencing #content, but the selector inside of #content?
[13:02:49] <jugstah> does jorn, the developer of jquery.validate come here? if so, when does he usually do?
[13:03:01] <pootpoot> can someone explain what exactly jquery detach is doing in html/js terms? When i try to detach and append a youtube iframe object, it seems to no longer call the youtube event handler functions for play/pause/etc
[13:03:28] <pootpoot> but i have been reading that its supposed to keep the event listeners
[13:03:54] <phlp> tbranyen: how about $ = function(s) { if (s == 'root') return jQuery("#content"); else return jQuery(s, "#content"); }
[13:04:07] <tbranyen> phlp: yeah something like that is pretty good :D
[13:04:38] <eddiemonge> pootpoot: it does. it just takes that element out of the dom. are you detaching the iframe itself?
[13:04:56] <pootpoot> well....... yeah i think im detaching the iframe
[13:05:17] <pootpoot> jQuery(YTIFramePlayer.b).detach()
[13:05:40] <LATerry> I see there's a .toggle() function but it seems to be to reveal or hide an element. Is there something equivalent to toggle an element's "disabled" between true and false?
[13:06:02] <pootpoot> the yt player has a property .b which is a reference to the actual iframe.... but i cant seem to detach the entire yt player object
[13:06:32] <pootpoot> but i know jQuery(YTIFramePlayer)[0] gives me a reference to the dom element itself
[13:06:43] <pootpoot> so i was wondering if i should just "detach and append" without jquery
[13:06:44] <pootpoot> hmmmmm
[13:06:47] <tech_help> anyone know what the reg ex do: new RegExp("==[^$]+?==");
[13:08:12] <brettgolding> Can someone take a look at this for me and see if you can spot something wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/theplastickid/5qabG/
[13:08:14] <eddiemonge> LATerry: make your own. its not hard.
[13:08:50] <LATerry> eddiemonge: That's my plan, just wanted to know if there was one already made. thanks
[13:14:29] <grom> tech_help maches optional string without '$' between '==' like ==asdas==
[13:14:54] <ccmonster> hey guys, I am getting an odd error. Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_bind'

[13:21:46] <brettgolding> grom: here is a jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/theplastickid/5qabG/
[13:21:49] <jugstah> phlp, i'll take another look at that page but im only a little better than a novice :-P :-)
[13:21:53] <datlap> when i click on the transfer tab, i get the error
[13:22:23] <grom>  brettgolding:  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.jparallax.js"></script>
[13:22:23] <brettgolding> it has a really basic implimentation process here is the plugin site (http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html) problem seems to be when mouse enters the "window" the images are not moving
[13:22:32] <brettgolding> almost like the script isn't firing
[13:22:52] <grom> brettgolding: it isn't
[13:23:51] <grom> brettgolding: you need to specify url in jsfiddle
[13:23:54] <brettgolding> i attached the script file to the jsFiddle resources
[13:24:12] <brettgolding> but I have just put an external URL into the src as well
[13:25:00] <brettgolding> grom: when the mouse enters the viewing window the images are supposed to react and move around but nothing happens.
[13:25:07] <jugstah> phlp, in the .rules("add", "required").. in the latter, how can i add 'min and max' rules?
[13:27:35] <phlp> jugstah: take your loan_period object and use it as the second param.. .rules('add', {required:true, number:true, min:11, ...})
[13:29:12] <brettgolding> what you think grom?
[13:30:17] <grom> brettgolding: look to the console.. syntax error and plugin script is not found
[13:32:18] <brettgolding> sorry this'll sound stupid but how do i do that? firebug?
[13:32:31] <brettgolding> i rarly use javascript
[13:33:24] <jugstah> phlp... ok... trying it on jsfiddler

[13:34:03] <kborchers> datlap: yeah, it's a mess. trying to get it working but not having much luck
[13:35:19] <kborchers> datlap: so are you planning on these tabs to just redirect to a new page or load the content into the panes?
[13:35:44] <datlap> kborchers: load the content below the tab
[13:37:09] <ccmonster> does the bbq param use the HTML5 History API? or is it another method?
[13:37:10] <grom> brettgolding: maybe you should use 'ul'
[13:37:21] <grom> brettgolding: http://jsfiddle.net/5qabG/6/
[13:37:32] <brettgolding> grom: i just edited my jsFiddle and its validating now
[13:38:16] <kborchers> datlap: your first problem is you can't have two sets of tabs like that and have them all load content into a single area. two sets of tabs, two content areas.
[13:38:19] <brettgolding> oh i see you dont need to declair the doctype. My first time using jsFiddle
[13:38:34] <kborchers> only way to make that happen would be to load the second set of tabs via ajax with the other content
[13:38:53] <brettgolding> I have tried with a UL didnt make a difference
[13:39:06] <grom> brettgolding: http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html
[13:39:11] <datlap> kborchers: i think i ll just redirect to another page when users click on a tab
[13:39:34] <grom> brettgolding: in the example is 'ul'
[13:39:47] <brettgolding> I also came accross this tutorial and replicated exactly: (http://www.script-tutorials.com/creating-ecards-using-jparallax/)
[13:39:51] <brettgolding> also didn't work
[13:41:37] <jugstah> phlp, when you said use it as second param, do you mean on the $(document).ready(function() {
[13:41:37] <jugstah>     $("loan_type").change(function() {
[13:41:37] <jugstah>         if ($(this).val() == "3396") {

[13:42:36] <mister> anyone built custom radio buttons using jquery ui? I want to use my own png for the button is that possible?
[13:42:42] <brettgolding> really got me stumped grom lol
[13:42:45] <gnarf> jugstah: don't ever paste code like that in IRC
[13:42:53] <gnarf> jugstah: use a pastebin
[13:42:59] <jugstah> gnarf- i know, stupid mistake on my part
[13:43:06] <phlp> jugstah: i meant the second param for .rules just like i typed.. the { } was your load_period you just pasted
[13:43:10] <jugstah> i clicked the wrong button on my track ball
[13:43:19] <datlap> kborchers: the new page will have the same tabs
[13:43:19] <datlap> kborchers: i just dont know why its not redirected. i run firebug and var url is undefined
[13:44:17] <jrbass> mister, yea you can use your own buttons
[13:44:43] <mister> jrbass: im trying to understand the documentation right now hehe
[13:45:16] <jrbass> i think toggle() would work for that
[13:46:35] <kborchers> datlap: don't use UI tabs as a navigation bar, that is not what they are for. you could do that easier with simple HTML menu. this is closer to what you should be going for. it should work except for you need to put the subtab code for the other pages in them http://jsfiddle.net/NwcYE/5/
[13:47:55] <HotPornYo> Check this out: http://bit.ly/HotPornYo
[13:49:17] <kborchers> CHECK THIS OUT YO ... heh that's awesome nice one snover
[13:49:22] <jrbass> heh
[13:50:01] <jaysern> what is the best way to escape HTML code inside of a javascript string ?
[13:50:14] <jrbass> $(kick).with.size_nines()
[13:50:17] <brettgolding> still no idea grom? its annoying because the script is loading the mouse entry is not working though
[13:50:24] <cliffordmeece> I have about 6-10 channels joined at any given time, but when I hear the 'kicked' sound effect, it is always someone getting bounced from #jquery
[13:50:36] <datlap> kborchers: thanks i ll play around some more
[13:50:37] <nascro> Was that a bot or an actual person
[13:51:35] <cliffordmeece> it attracts the bots yo
[13:51:44] <phlp> snover? 100% machine
[13:51:55] <nascro> haha
[13:51:58] <nascro> No
[13:52:06] <jugstah> eggdrop bots? :-)
[13:52:52] <snover> INSERT COIN
[13:53:21] * kborchers gives coin to snover ;)
[13:53:30] <snover> INSERT $1,000,000 MORE COINS
[13:53:39] <kborchers> haha
[13:54:40] <mister> jrbass: Could you give me an example please? I've been trying for hours lol
[13:54:59] <mister> jrbass: All I get is to make my radiobuttons to disappear
[13:57:21] <jrbass> mister: i'll try it
[13:57:50] <mister> jrbass: thanks :)
[14:00:38] <jrbass> maybe this: http://ajaxdump.com/2009/09/03/images-as-checkbox-and-radio-button-using-jquery/
[14:01:49] <jugstah> hmm... jsfiddler removes <form>
[14:02:21] <mister> jrbass: let me check it
[14:04:42] <sadmicrowave> jrbass, I don't understand, how does styling checkboxes and radio buttons have anything to do with ajax?
[14:07:35] <krazyj> HEY all... I have this lazy image loader script: http://bit.ly/oNOe4j - on line 37 of the JS, i replaceWith the hidden <pre> containers with the img tag inside. however, i've set the image tag to be display:none, because i'd like to do a fadeIn. my problem is that when i attempt $(this).fadeIn("slow"); after that line 37, it doesnt fadeIn... any ideas?
[14:08:36] <krazyj> sorry, here it is with the HTML: http://bit.ly/nyvB9C (or just click the newest revision on the side)
[14:08:47] <thinkt4nk> krazyj > are you sure the browser has loaded the image?
[14:08:58] <thinkt4nk> 'cause it likely hasn't
[14:09:02] <thinkt4nk> if that's what you're seeing
[14:09:11] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: hmmm let me try some logic to wait until it loads. thanks!
[14:09:33] <thinkt4nk> np
[14:10:06] <dabear> hi everyone. Assume I have 10000 table cells. I have now selected randomly about half of those, and i need to temporarily remove the cells contents(but now the cell it self), how should I do that?
[14:10:29] <dabear> the use case is a bit more complex, but assume I have 5000 random cells selected
[14:10:43] <snover> ten thousand? I can already say you’re doing it wrong
[14:10:57] <thinkt4nk> $('td.yourclass').each( function() { $(this).text(''); } );
[14:11:04] <dabear> nah, it's a userscript
[14:11:12] <snover> how does that make it better?
[14:11:18] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: no dice. i tried this revised JS and it didn't work: https://gist.github.com/8e4b3bd3cad79c986cdd
[14:11:20] <dabear> thinkt4nk: nope, I would have to restore the text afterwards
[14:11:34] <thinkt4nk> aha! another requirement
[14:11:36] <dabear> snover: i can't decide how many cells are gonna be present
[14:11:37] <thinkt4nk> lol
[14:11:38] <vandemar> dabear: then hide all the subelements?
[14:12:04] <snover> visibility: hidden. don’t go blowing yourself up now.
[14:12:13] <dabear> snover: can vary, from a couple of hundred to a lot more
[14:12:16] <mister> jrbass: looks like it's too old haha
[14:12:45] <mister> jrbass: $input_id[0] is undefined :S
[14:13:16] <vandemar> if all columns (<td>) in a row are marked hidden, wouldn't that collapse the row, and is that what you want?
[14:14:07] <vandemar> s/columns/cells/
[14:14:08] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: any ideas?
[14:14:16] <thinkt4nk> krazyj > registering load isn't going to work for images
[14:14:37] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: i tried it with $(this).load(..., too, and no success
[14:14:38] <thinkt4nk> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[14:14:47] <thinkt4nk> correct, it won;t
[14:14:49] <thinkt4nk> won't
[14:15:20] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: i tried that, no luck
[14:15:32] <thinkt4nk> that's what I'm saying
[14:15:35] <thinkt4nk> look at the caveats
[14:15:42] <krazyj> ah damn
[14:16:00] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: what do we do when jquery doesn't work? :P
[14:16:29] <thinkt4nk> lol, I think I had luck with this -> https://github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages
[14:16:40] <ecdysis> krazyj: fap?
[14:16:59] <krazyj> ecdysis: not appropriate for the office lol
[14:17:05] <ecdysis> lol
[14:17:11] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: taking a look... thanks alot
[14:17:14] <thinkt4nk> np
[14:18:20] <dabear> vandemar: thx, there are direct children that are not html elements though
[14:18:28] <dabear> for example text
[14:18:38] <dabear> but i'm gonna wrap those in spans
[14:25:11] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: no dice, yet again
[14:25:12] <krazyj> :(
[14:25:58] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: this time, i tried this: https://gist.github.com/45a3fb057c3ba926e738
[14:27:15] <krazyj> to catch everyone up... I have this lazy image loader script: http://bit.ly/oNOe4j - on line 37 of the JS, i replaceWith the hidden <pre> containers with the img tag inside. however, i've set the image tag to be display:none, because i'd like to do a fadeIn. my problem is that when i attempt $(this).fadeIn("slow"); after that line 37, it doesnt fadeIn... any ideas?
[14:27:23] <krazyj> HTML is here:  http://bit.ly/nyvB9C
[14:27:41] <krazyj> trying various things to force the interpreter to wait until the image loads hasnt worked, either
[14:28:44] <krazyj> in fact, just doing this: `$(this).css("display","block");` won't even change the css after line 37 of that JS
[14:29:24] <nascro> Anyone upgrade to Lion?
[14:30:31] <krazyj> thinkt4nk: any ideas>?
[14:30:40] <nascro> Let me make that question relevant: Any jQuery users upgrade to Lion?
[14:30:53] <hadees> So I have an html form I want to submit but not actually leave the page.  Instead when they hit submit I want to just do some other javascript. How would I go about doing that?
[14:31:06] <Woet> hadees: ajax.
[14:31:10] <nascro> hadees: very, very carefully
[14:34:16] <seldom> Hi. I'm trying to use slidetoggle but for somereason cannot get it to work. I basically just copied the example and changed a few things..here the code if anyone could help: http://pastebin.com/4f6vzziZ
[14:35:39] <Aric> How do you set the height of an ID based on the height of the viewport... I tried this:
[14:35:40] <Aric> 	var height = $(window).height();
[14:35:40] <Aric> 	$('#main').css('min-height:'+height);
[14:35:43] <ccmonster> hey, if i want to grab one of a few classes on an element by a regex pattern, how do I accomplish this?
[14:36:19] <ccmonster> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3044573/using-jquery-to-get-size-of-viewport
[14:36:48] <ccmonster> take the : off
[14:37:00] <ccmonster> $('#main').css('height',height);
[14:37:15] <ccmonster>  or $('#main').css('min-height',height); rather
[14:37:43] <ccmonster> and console.log('viewport height:', height); to dbl check that its capturing the height correctly.
[14:45:50] <krazyj> so... I have this lazy image loader script: http://bit.ly/oNOe4j - on line 37 of the JS, i replaceWith the hidden <pre> containers with the img tag inside. however, i've set the image tag to be display:none, because i'd like to do a fadeIn. my problem is that when i attempt $(this).fadeIn("slow"); after that line 37, it doesnt fadeIn... any ideas?
[14:45:58] <krazyj> HTML is here:  http://bit.ly/nyvB9C
[14:46:00] <ColKurtz> anybody else use colorbox a lot?
[14:46:54] <ccmonster> not sure totaly krazyj , but try visibility:hidden
[14:47:05] <krazyj> ccmonster: didnt work
[14:48:16] <ccmonster> not sure how the lazy loader works, so without getting into how it hides and shows, i would suggest you put up an example
[14:48:54] <djQuery> .filter
[14:49:07] <djQuery> ?.filter
[14:49:07] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:49:57] <ccmonster> hey djQuery , how do i grab a particular class off of an element if i know its format? so i know it has a class of bg-color
[14:50:36] <djQuery> ccmonster: dont know besides grabing all of them then splitting on space then looping through them
[14:51:04] <djQuery> ccmonster: .filter could help with this.
[14:51:11] <ccmonster> yea, there is a classList method, but its not very 'backwards compatible'
[14:51:49] <djQuery> ccmonster: just get the attr then?
[14:51:53] <ColKurtz> Would anybody be down to help me debug something rather mysterious in IE8? http://pugetsoundauction.com/index.html
[14:52:16] <ccmonster> explain your issue or have an example ColKurtz
[14:52:18] <ColKurtz> does clicking "click here for brochure" properly load up the colorbox?
[14:52:28] <ColKurtz> or does it show it endlessly loading?
[14:52:53] <ColKurtz> Most of the time it works fine for me
[14:53:25] <ColKurtz> but sometimes after clicking around  the different colorbox links (map, returning guest, click here for brochure) i get the bug where the inline content doesn't load
[14:53:26] <ccmonster> hm, i do the .css('background-color') and get a rgb interpretation, i just want the #code
[14:53:42] <ColKurtz> I didn't find any issues in github
[14:53:44] <ccmonster> something isn't firing right. Console.log it out
[14:54:00] <ccmonster> console.log() the event handler
[14:54:21] <krazyj> ccmonster: iamjo.sh/demo.html
[14:54:26] <krazyj> http://iamjo.sh/demo.html
[14:54:29] <krazyj> that's my image loader
[14:54:49] <krazyj> here's the files: http://iamjo.sh/code.zip
[14:55:26] <krazyj> basically, on line 37 of the jquery.lazyLoader.js file, i set the value of the <pre>s to the commented out html containing the image
[14:55:32] <krazyj> which loads the image
[14:55:44] <krazyj> well, when i do that, i want to fade it in... not just popup suddenly
[14:56:15] <krazyj> my problem is, if i insert after line 37: $(this).fadeIn("slow"); ... it wont actually fade in
[14:56:41] <krazyj> for some reason, i can't select what i want to select here... what im looking for is hiding somewhere in teh DOM
[14:57:12] <krazyj> in the <head>, there's a text/css style tag for setting the pres/imgs to display:none... right now, they just show up
[15:01:43] <Aric> With this JSON data, http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=false, how would I get just "Brooklyn, NY" in a .getJSON function?  with the callback function(data), I've been trying -> data.sublocality.long_name since it had type but I know that's wrong and there are no lables on it... any help is appreciated.
[15:03:37] <ccmonster> just use the key name in the json, '.' seperated
[15:03:46] <ccmonster> you're just traversing it incorrectly.
[15:04:55] <Aric> but they have no labels, so data.short_name and it would match multiple objects right?
[15:06:43] <Merrick> this allan jardine guy is awesome.  how come i haven't heard of him till now?
[15:07:39] <ccmonster> show an example of the json string in pastebin or pastie or something
[15:08:14] <ccmonster> yes, he has some very cool scripts Merrick
[15:08:32] <Aric> ccmonster, click the link?
[15:08:40] <ccmonster> im particularly a fan of his link checker script.
[15:08:55] <ccmonster> i cant, it says request denied
[15:08:56] <Aric> http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=false
[15:09:00] <ccmonster> just pastie out the json string
[15:09:01] <Aric> it had the comma at the end
[15:09:04] <Aric> sry
[15:09:28] <nezZario> who ?
[15:09:34] <nezZario> who has the L33T SCKRIPTZ
[15:09:45] <ccmonster> lol nezZario
[15:09:50] <Aric> the function is http://pastie.org/2322090
[15:10:34] <ccmonster> use a live js tester.
[15:10:39] <ccmonster> @pastie
[15:11:11] <ccmonster> bah, whats that site where you can run js live? ...im blanking
[15:11:25] <Aric> jsfiddle.net
[15:11:27] <Aric> i think
[15:11:44] <ccmonster> yep. put it there.
[15:11:46] <Aric> but eh it needs the geolocation data i give it
[15:11:53] <Aric> so i didnt know how to strip down properly
[15:11:54] <ccmonster> just fake it for a test.
[15:11:58] <Aric> ok
[15:12:16] <ccmonster> just put some dummy data in that will get a correct response back, throw it in fiddle, and voilah, people will jump in to help you out pretty quick
[15:15:32] <Aric> http://jsfiddle.net/p7MY9/
[15:15:43] <Aric> JSON data @ http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=false
[15:15:56] <Aric> but it doesn't change Unknown to Brooklyn, NY
[15:18:43] <ccmonster> you need to input the lat/long data in there
[15:18:50] <ccmonster> or put the html for the inputs in the fiddle
[15:18:54] <Aric> where?
[15:19:03] <Aric> latlng is iun the json url
[15:19:14] <Aric> and it should get the json data back and parse then replace unknown
[15:19:47] <Aric> http://jsfiddle.net/p7MY9/1/
[15:19:55] <Aric> it doenst need position since we hardcoded it in for the test
[15:20:30] <ccmonster> ok.
[15:21:44] <Aric> http://jsfiddle.net/p7MY9/2/
[15:21:51] <Aric> even static text wont update unknown :/
[15:22:47] <brianpWins> i have a .change listener on a form. I change the values of some hidden fields via $(field).val(new_value). but it's not triggering the form.change function is that normal ?
[15:22:48] <Aric> so i dunno if its running the getJSON
[15:23:13] <ccmonster> check for the correct listeners brianpWins
[15:23:34] <ccmonster> and Ariic, hardcode a json response into the fiddle. then parse as json. Your issue isn't getting json, it's parsing it
[15:23:39] <ccmonster> from what i understand
[15:23:39] <brianpWins> ccmonster: I'm not sure I follow?
[15:26:32] <ccmonster> how are you 'changing' the values?
[15:27:02] <ccmonster> depending on the element, the event you want to 'listen' for might be different. There are some inconsistancies I believe on the way diff forms need to be targeted/listened to
[15:27:09] <brianpWins> most of the fields are changed by user input and the listener works for them. But via jquery I'm changing 4 particular fields with $(field).val(new_value)
[15:27:34] <brianpWins> and when i change those 4 fields the listener isn't fired
[15:27:58] <sphinxxx> any good templates out there, that allow for images to be uploaded easily? i  need to build a site for a photographer, who needs to easily be able to add images to the site without editing code
[15:28:20] <totalshare> download his: VERO Ragazza 20enne BELLISSIMA.rar
[15:28:22] <totalshare> download his: VERO Ragazza 20enne BELLISSIMA.rar
[15:29:33] <ccmonster> shinxx, there are some really good multiple file uploader scripts
[15:29:39] <ccmonster> just google for jquery file uploader
[15:30:44] <ccmonster> http://api.jquery.com/trigger
[15:31:05] <sphinxxx> ccmonster:  thx
[15:31:07] <ccmonster> try that brianpWins , it should allow you to just do a $('#element').trigger('change') or something
[15:31:15] <sphinxxx> anything out there that's specific for images though?
[15:31:24] <ccmonster> then any listeners attached to that element will be fired
[15:31:27] <sphinxxx> that would let you upload an image and make a thumbnail as well
[15:31:39] <ccmonster> you could just attach something that shows a thumbnail
[15:32:21] <Aric> ccmonster, jsonurl is correct but why would this line not execute:
[15:32:21] <Aric> 		$.getJSON(jsonurl, function(data) {
[15:32:21] <Aric> 			$('#location').html('Hi');
[15:32:21] <Aric> 		});
[15:32:36] <ccmonster> did you change that in your fiddle?
[15:32:38] <ricklamers> I have a problem with accessing global variables with the $.post function. Could any1 assist me?
[15:33:04] <ccmonster> whats wrong ricklamers ? post your question and a pastie/fiddle is pssible and we will try to help
[15:33:40] <brianpWins> ccmonster: that works, thanks
[15:33:46] <codeshah> hey guys, when I do append("<table>") it closes the table tag, too
[15:33:51] <ricklamers> http://jsfiddle.net/VBv32/ this is alerting 'undefined' for me.
[15:34:02] <codeshah> is that expected? how can I avoid that so I can string together a bunch of differnet items to my container
[15:35:27] <ricklamers> While the returned data isn't equal to 'undefined' when I do $('div').html(data); inside the ajax 'success' callback.
[15:36:13] <ricklamers> Any idea ccmonster?
[15:36:39] <molavy> hi
[15:37:15] <Aric> hmm im getting XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=38.901222,-77.26526&sensor=false&callback=?. Origin http://islamlocal.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. in console
[15:37:51] <molavy> how can i load table data via ajax in best way,optimize connection and trigger when data changed in server?
[15:38:17] <molavy> table changed by some user and every user must have uodated table
[15:38:50] <ricklamers> I think triggering callbacks when data changes in a database/server isn't possible using ajax in a efficient way.
[15:38:59] <ricklamers> It has to do with polling or something.
[15:39:26] <brianpWins> anyone used the GoogleMaps JS API ?
[15:39:30] <molavy> i want find best way and optimize way
[15:40:34] <molavy> like this, when you change table that i see it change automatically
[15:42:24] <molavy> what is best algorithm and model  for this type of connection
[15:42:33] <cogman> Hello all, is there a way in jquery to find out where an element falls within its siblings? For example http://jsfiddle.net/U2MqP/ (if what I'm trying to do isn't clear, let me know).
[15:43:06] <ColKurtz> small question, i'm trying to sort out a weird bug I can't seem to reproduce
[15:43:23] <ColKurtz> does clicking "Click Here for Brochure" bring up a lightbox (colorbox) in IE8 for you? http://pugetsoundauction.com/index.html
[15:44:11] <cogman> In other words, if all the siblings of a given selector where in an array, I'm trying to figure out the index value for the sibling found by the selector.
[15:44:50] <ricklamers> ColKurtz it does for me.
[15:45:12] <ricklamers> Using IE8.0 in IETester Win7 64-bit
[15:45:14] <ColKurtz> i have a client complaining that it never loads
[15:45:34] <ricklamers> Tell him to fuck IE because it sucks balls :P
[15:45:51] <ColKurtz> whhat if you click around the different colorbox links (map link, returning guest, and brochure link)
[15:46:39] <ricklamers> All working so far so good.
[15:47:09] <ColKurtz> fuck it
[15:47:21] <ColKurtz> i'm gonna drop the opt-in and say it's an edge case i can't figure out
[15:47:37] <cogman> ricklamers: Ahh, if only we could tell the world to "fuck IE because it sucks balls". I want, so hard, for IE to just die already.
[15:47:55] <ricklamers> cogman Haha so true.
[15:48:04] <ricklamers> ColKurtz it also works in IE7 for me.
[15:48:20] <ColKurtz> better yet
[15:48:26] <ColKurtz> i'm just gonna force ie7 mode
[15:48:40] <ricklamers> IE6 also working.
[15:48:45] <ricklamers> Buggy PNG's though.
[15:48:49] <ricklamers> But WHO CARES
[15:48:54] <ricklamers> It's IE mother&*& 6
[15:49:02] <ricklamers> *ill stop spamming now*
[15:50:37] <ScottO_> why would a slideUp('slow') be fast?
[15:50:58] <ccmonster> oksushi, im back.
[15:51:26] <oksushi> oh?
[15:51:36] <Woet> act like you care, oksushi
[15:52:06] <oksushi> Oh, but I do.
[15:52:26] <ccmonster> haha. i didnt even mean to put his name in lol
[15:52:55] <Woet> welcome back ccmonster!
[15:55:07] <ScottO_> and slideUp seems to make the divd slide underneath another before disappearing
[15:55:14] <ScottO_> rather than actually sliding up
[15:55:54] <ccmonster> you might have a css block/padding issue with the div or surrounding div that you are animating
[15:56:26] <ccmonster> slideup is tricky. I love the effect, but i hate the inconsistancy of the implementation
[15:57:01] <molavy> how can i load table data via ajax in best way,optimize connection and trigger when data changed in server?
[15:57:01] <ScottO_> the div below the one im sliding up, appears to slide over the one im trying to slideup
[15:58:50] <ccmonster> that's the slide affect. you might want to try something else.
[15:58:57] <madprops> any idea how can I trigger an event once a lightbox overlay closes, slimbox specifically?
[15:59:02] <ccmonster> molavy, if it's just table data, $.load()
[15:59:16] <ccmonster> depends on the event madprops
[15:59:54] <madprops> ccmonster, i need to focus a textbox
[16:00:16] <ccmonster> $('#id-of-textbox).focus();
[16:00:25] <ccmonster> $('#id-of-textbox').focus();
[16:00:31] <ccmonster> missed a '
[16:02:02] <ScottO_> ccmonster: was sliding up a fieldset instead of a div
[16:02:04] <ScottO_> :/
[16:02:18] <ScottO_> it didnt like that
[16:03:12] <ccmonster> yea, i guess not :)
[16:03:15] <ccmonster> all better now?
[16:03:18] <ScottO_> yeah
[16:03:49] <ScottO_> the fieldset was sliding up and the fields werent :P
[16:03:58] <ccmonster> awesome. you can play with the speed and al lthat as well : $('#element').slideUp('fast') , or $('#el').slideUp(200);
[16:04:02] <ccmonster> haha
[16:04:19] <ccmonster> i think default slideUp() is 600, but i might be mistaken
[16:04:21] <ScottO_> yeah i like slow
[16:04:29] <ScottO_> gets the job done
[16:04:39] <ScottO_> and still lets the user see whats going on
[16:04:56] <ScottO_> funny to change 7 things fast and the user is like .. wtf happened?
[16:05:14] <ccmonster> hah. yep
[16:06:09] <ScottO_> testing everything with selenium IDE for firefox, great tool
[16:06:36] <ccmonster> yeap. quite good.
[16:06:48] <ScottO_> i wish append had a callback
[16:06:53] <ccmonster> and look into html5 boilerplate. awesome deploy package to take your sites efficiency to another level
[16:10:42] <ScottO_> whats the best way to insert some html, and then slideDown?
[16:10:58] <ScottO_> without havign ti slideDown during or before the html gets inserted
[16:13:09] <ScottO_> nm
[16:13:22] <huglester> any fancybox experts here... I'm not sure why $("#fancy_notice").fancybox().trigger('click'); - does not open the fancybox, says that content not found
[16:14:42] <molavy> ccmonster, i want load it when table chenged, think i want always have a table with last 10 entry's ,but i don't know when new entery add
[16:16:47] <ccmonster> just do a count of the rows
[16:17:34] <ccmonster> var lastcount = $('#myTable').children('tr'); if(thisCount>lastCount){//do some stuff}
[16:17:45] <ProLoser|Work> hallooooo
[16:17:55] <ProLoser|Work> can i add my own document callbacks?
[16:18:03] <ProLoser|Work> like $(document).included()?
[16:18:05] <ProLoser|Work> and if so, how
[16:18:43] <ProLoser|Work> like, you can do $(document).ready(fn); and it will execute multiple functions across the page, so how do i do this custom?
[16:20:47] <ccmonster> not sure ProLoser, havent tried it.
[16:24:03] <krazyj> so... I have this lazy image loader script: http://bit.ly/oNOe4j - on line 37 of the JS, i replaceWith the hidden <pre> containers with the img tag inside. however, i've set the image tag to be display:none, because i'd like to do a fadeIn. my problem is that when i attempt $(this).fadeIn("slow"); after that line 37, it doesnt fadeIn... any ideas?
[16:24:09] <krazyj> HTML is here:  http://bit.ly/nyvB9C
[16:31:37] <jtoy> does this still work with rails? jQuery.ajaxSetup({ 'beforeSend': function(xhr) {xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/javascript")} })
[16:31:52] <jtoy> I added that but my jquery requests all come in as html
[16:33:44] <austen> Javascript scope issue: when I attach an event handler using .live() I'm trying to call an object method I've defined this.toggleMenu(obj), but the reference isn't working inside the .live() callback function. How do I reference an objet method from inside a jQuery callback function?
[16:35:26] <jtoy> anyone?
[16:37:16] <fabiobik> how to remove an element on array by name?
[16:39:41] <austinbv> anyone a coffee script/jq plugin pro https://gist.github.com/1126358 I am trying to figure out a better way to do line 34
[16:45:42] <austinbv> don't these two points in the JQ plugin authoring page contradict ?
[16:45:43] <austinbv> Don't clutter the jQuery.fn object with more than one namespace per plugin.
[16:45:43] <austinbv> Always namespace your methods, events and data.
[16:47:11] <fabiobik> !help
[16:47:19] <fabiobik> !+help
[16:47:26] <fabiobik> !array
[16:47:28] <fabiobik> xd
[16:47:46] <austinbv> what do you need fabiobik
[17:03:37] <cakehero> I'm using the fullCalendar plugin inside a modal, however, it doesn't load until I resize the window, any ideas why that would be?
[17:03:49] <cakehero> The .dialog() opens, then, nothing happens until I resize the screen
[17:04:17] <cakehero> c0d3z0rs looks like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/596493348
[17:11:24] <austen> Man... Still completely lost...
[17:13:33] <austen> https://ideone.com/Xw1QY
[17:15:09] <austen> line 35 is the problem. I need to reference the function defined in Menu object from inside a .live() callback function.
[17:22:43] <austen> cancel that. Figured it out.
[17:29:23] <ProLoser|Work> is there a way to do a custom alternative to $(document).ready()?
[17:29:33] <ProLoser|Work> namely a function that i can append to and then trigger at a time of my choosing?
[17:30:13] <ajpiano> one does not "append to" a function
[17:30:30] <ajpiano> $(document).bind("aCustomEvent", fn);   $(document).trigger("aCustomEvent");
[17:31:27] <frozenpager> a question: I am in process of installing Jquery into wordpress, and i ve been keeping passng down the road to this-- in .css, I want an if statement to detect if jquery is called; how do I code that exactly?
[17:31:38] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: but the beauty of .read() is that people lace it throughout their document more than once
[17:31:56] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: uh
[17:31:58] <ProLoser|Work> nvm
[17:32:00] <ProLoser|Work> i'm a retard aren't i
[17:32:07] <ProLoser|Work> i should just bind everything to my 1 event
[17:32:12] <ProLoser|Work> and they'll all be triggered, right?
[17:32:18] <ajpiano> i guess?
[17:32:38] <ajpiano> frozenpager what?
[17:33:05] <frozenpager> I took some classes a long time ago, so i m incredibly rusty
[17:33:06] <ajpiano> you want to call a jquery method that detects whether or not it is a jqueryy method?
[17:33:08] <frozenpager> but basically
[17:33:11] <frozenpager> i want this to happen
[17:33:14] <CodeZombie> hey guys, I'm looking to track events for when a user selects text in a contenteditable element... Since the .select() method won't work outside of a text field, what would you use in it's place to track the mouseup / keyup / dblclick / etc... combinations that could be used to select text?
[17:33:39] <ajpiano> CodeZombie, i use a library called Rangy
[17:33:41] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work suo
[17:33:45] <cakehero> fancy seeing you here
[17:33:46] <ajpiano> ?g rangy googlecode @ CodeZombie
[17:33:47] <bot-t> CodeZombie, rangy - A cross-browser JavaScript range and ... - Google Code - http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[17:33:53] <cakehero> suo = sup
[17:33:56] <frozenpager> if jquery is on, I pass on to a css element modifier (background:none) but if its off, it passes onto the default background
[17:34:04] <CodeZombie> ajpiano: that's for recording the range selected, not actually tracking the event
[17:34:10] <CodeZombie> I'm using it as well
[17:34:13] <frozenpager> im not sure HOW to implement that concept
[17:34:16] <ProLoser|Work> cakehero: not using cake at my new job :)
[17:34:24] <cakehero> where is that?
[17:34:25] <dgouldin> frozenpager if (window.jquery !== undefined) ?
[17:34:28] <cakehero> dude scroll up
[17:34:31] <cakehero> and tell me how to fix my problem
[17:34:46] <frozenpager> !== or !=
[17:34:53] <CodeZombie> ajpiano: for example... to select text, you can do this a number of ways... click down, drag, and release... click, and use shift + arrow ( mac ), etc...
[17:34:58] <dgouldin> frozenpager I've got a crockford video you should watch ;)
[17:35:27] <CodeZombie> would be nice if jQuery had a method that detected when text was selected
[17:35:38] <CodeZombie> even if it didn't track the selection itself
[17:37:32] <ajpiano> are there event events that actually fire when text is selected?
[17:37:35] <ajpiano> i don't beleive so...
[17:37:54] <CodeZombie> right, which is why I'm trying to find a solid combination of events to use
[17:38:19] <CodeZombie> I suppose I could just watch mouseup + keyup, but since this is a contenteditable keyup will get fired a lot
[17:38:32] <aximilation> I think the closest you could do would be  ^^ CodeZombie beat me to it
[17:38:58] <aximilation> mouse click + drag for mouse selection, also watch the shift key for keyboard selection
[17:39:17] <CodeZombie> have to add in double click
[17:39:19] <CodeZombie> well
[17:39:22] <CodeZombie> I guess that's mouseup
[17:39:51] <ajpiano> yeah, i would say just using those events and checking for selection existence is about as good as you can do
[17:39:56] <aximilation> I might think of tracking it in conjuction with the down to figure drag time and differentiate it from a normal click
[17:40:08] <aximilation> click vs "slow click" + movement
[17:40:17] <aximilation> sounds like a hack though!
[17:40:23] <frozenpager> i think im going at it the complicated way -- im in the middle of tyring to dissemble this http://www.onextrapixel.com/2010/02/23/how-to-use-jquery-to-make-slick-page-transitions/ and installing it into wordpress
[17:41:10] <frozenpager> in the top part, where there is a script to display:none-- where do  I place the default .css attributes, before or afterwards
[17:41:25] <CodeZombie> aximilation, ajpiano: here's another issue... if you mousedown, drag and your cursor leaves the contenteditable area... your text is still seleted, but the mouseup event doesn't fire
[17:41:32] <CodeZombie> so I have to now through in mouseleave...
[17:41:37] <CodeZombie> blah!
[17:41:46] <ajpiano> CodeZombie: not even on the document??
[17:42:10] <ajpiano> this a scary tutorial :/
[17:42:11] <CodeZombie> ajpiano tracking it on document doesn't work... I've had to bring it down to tracking on boxy
[17:42:13] <CodeZombie> body
[17:42:29] <ajpiano> hiding the body on document ready is gonna look so FOUC-y
[17:42:59] <ajpiano> http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[17:43:46] <CodeZombie> ajpiano: won't http straming remedy that?
[17:43:51] <CodeZombie> streaming*
[17:44:03] <CodeZombie> (in the future of course)
[17:44:04] <ajpiano> eh?
[17:45:26] <CodeZombie> html 5 http streaming... in the use case of your resources / structure loaded before the content. For example, on a dynamic page that takes more than a few miliseconds, the resources are loaded first... then populated w/ content... This would be unoticable to the user, but allow things like scripts, and such to load before anything else
[17:45:58] <CodeZombie> unless I'm forgetting something specific, it's been a while since I read any info on the subject
[17:46:37] <CodeZombie> browser and server have to support it, but I would think that would fix that conundrum in the future.
[17:47:02] <ajpiano> um
[17:47:02] <ajpiano> not sure how exactly relates to FOUC on a wordpress blog
[17:48:00] <ajpiano> cool, i'll teleport there
[17:49:16] <rchavik> is there a recommended way to localize javascript files?
[17:50:43] <sshaginyan> With Jquery-ui date picker is there a way I can format the date bye 05/14/2012 ?
[17:50:50] <sshaginyan> by*
[17:51:26] <ajpiano> CodeZombie, what exactly is "HTML5 HTTP Streaming"
[17:51:32] <electronplusplus> Hi
[17:52:06] <electronplusplus> I'm trying to make document as droppable, using $(document).droppable(); doesn't work
[17:52:18] <ajpiano> you definitely can't make the document a droppable
[17:52:22] <ajpiano> you can *try* with body
[17:52:41] <ajpiano> but i would try to use a top level container, persoanlly
[17:53:00] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: my problem is
[17:53:10] <electronplusplus> I'm developing a small editor
[17:53:17] <electronplusplus> and I'm using frames
[17:53:29] <electronplusplus> I'm trying to make object droppable between frames
[17:54:03] <ajpiano> not entirely sure that's going to work :/
[17:54:55] <electronplusplus> It have to work
[17:55:02] <electronplusplus> there are web apps that use frames
[17:55:17] <electronplusplus> and work this way
[17:55:30] <ajpiano> do they use juqery ui's draggable and droppable library?
[17:55:33] <ajpiano> or some other solution
[17:55:40] <electronplusplus> no idea
[17:55:50] <electronplusplus> I'm trying to do this from scratch
[17:55:55] <ajpiano> so you're saying "it has to work because i've kind of seen it"
[17:56:04] <electronplusplus> yes
[17:56:06] <ajpiano> there's no point to doing anything "from scratch"
[17:56:10] <ajpiano> do some research.
[17:56:12] <electronplusplus> for example a diagram web app
[17:56:36] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: "from scrath" because I'm learning HTML5's features
[17:56:50] <electronplusplus> it comes with native drag drop
[17:56:52] <ajpiano> so then why wouldn't you use HTML5 native drag and drop
[17:56:57] <ajpiano> instead of jquery ui's one...
[17:57:04] <electronplusplus> I've tryed
[17:57:16] <ajpiano> i've heard it's kind of clunky but i've seen people use it
[17:57:38] <electronplusplus> ye, they pass the DOM object id
[17:57:51] <electronplusplus> I think
[17:57:59] <ajpiano> i think, however, if you're expecting the behaviour of native html5 dnd from jqueryui's draggable and droppable you are going to be sorely disappointed
[17:58:28] <electronplusplus> no, I'm not
[17:59:03] <ajpiano> i haven't ever heard of someone successfuly doing cross frame drag and drop with jquery ui...
[17:59:49] <electronplusplus> I'm using jquery ui
[17:59:51] <ciriuz> @all - does the jqueryui sort method work more like the html5 api dnd?
[18:00:25] <CodeZombie> is this not valid syntax? https://gist.github.com/4689b379cba88409e6ca
[18:00:49] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: right.... so...
[18:01:02] <ajpiano> CodeZombie, it is valid syntactically but will not work
[18:01:03] <electronplusplus> and it doesn't work
[18:01:09] <ajpiano> that's what i said
[18:01:13] <ajpiano> i said it will not work for what you are trying to do
[18:01:20] <ajpiano> and i have never heard of anyone being successful doing it
[18:01:30] <ajpiano> CodeZombie live can only be called directly against a selector
[18:01:31] <electronplusplus> how diagram web apps work?
[18:01:48] <ajpiano> CodeZombie: use delegate instead()
[18:01:51] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: uh, depends on the app
[18:01:59] <ajpiano> canvas? svg?
[18:02:15] <electronplusplus> in this moment simple img
[18:02:33] <electronplusplus> $('img').draggable();
[18:04:01] <ajpiano> i have to uh.  leave.
[18:04:10] <electronplusplus> no problem :)
[18:04:12] <electronplusplus> thanks anyway
[18:04:14] <ajpiano> good luck on your perpetual motion machine or whatever
[18:04:14] <ajpiano> :p
[18:04:21] <electronplusplus> lol
[18:22:05] <z1000> is there a way to get a variable height of a div container with ajax? So before I load my content.. I want to shrink the containers height... load the content in... then animiate the height to the proper full height.. any suggestions?
[18:23:07] <jugstah> so i can't really validate any code using jsfiddler?
[18:23:16] <jugstah> it spits out a .part file?
[18:26:15] <z1000> so this wont work eh? 			$("#work-list").html('loading..').delay(1500).load(loadUrl);
[18:31:02] <Reaper507> Hello, all. Plese help with $.getJSON(). JS: http://pastebin.com/2S4RiRGY  PHP: http://pastebin.com/YC0Bhbca I open the page with the js code in Firefox and I see that on the firebug's "network" tab a query to counter.php can not be completed. What I'm doing wrong?

[19:17:50] <Mariaa> hey
[19:18:31] <Mariaa> why an ajax on a page would conflict with a jquery slider?
[19:19:08] <SuperID> I'm trying to fill a div with the contents of an array.   for (x in etwds) {$('#references').append("p").text(etwds[x]);}   I'm only getting the last value of the array.  I thought append() would add a new <p> to my "references" div
[19:24:46] <hypno> i have an encoding issue. when i use jquery to append some swedish characters to a div, they all end up like garbage. i'm using utf8. any ideas?
[19:25:05] <hypno> oh, and i am appending to a div in a jquery dialog.
[19:33:06] <macheleon> if a string contains letters and numbers and other characters, how can I extract only the numbers?
[19:34:02] <coldhead> with a regular expression?
[19:34:07] <macheleon> sure
[19:35:18] <macheleon> hang on getting closer
[19:35:54] <coldhead> that's what she said
[19:36:02] <macheleon> she sure did
[19:36:57] <macheleon> looks like string.replace() will do it once I figure out the regexp/substr to use for all letters and underscores
[19:37:14] <letterpress> i'm finding some json strings on our site are getting "corrupt" at some point. there's an exclamation mark followed by a newline followed by a space. this doesn't parse well! does this sound familiar to anyone?
[19:37:52] <letterpress> could be happening on the front end or the back end, not sure because it's hard to reproduce this problem…which shows up in our error reporting but nowhere else.
[19:37:58] <coldhead> macheleon: http://jsfiddle.net/2csee/
[19:38:02] <coldhead> that's the lazy way <3
[19:38:51] <coldhead> where \D is "not a digit"
[19:39:06] <macheleon> ahha
[19:39:26] <macheleon> it seems I have 1.5 ways now :) thanks as always
[19:39:53] <coldhead> WELCOME AS ALWAYS
[19:45:34] <bregoldae> I just installed JRAC, but I'm not too sure what I do to get it to crop at this point… I'm using PHP as my image processor. I guess I'm stuck on what to pass to php...
[19:47:13] <pavan> good evening
[19:47:19] <bregoldae1> dropped connection sorry
[19:48:11] <pavan> I have one of the tabs defined as this (ajax content) <li> <a id="dayerrors" href="/day/events/">Day </a> </li>
[19:48:31] <pavan> When content is loaded from that location, jquery within that isnt working
[19:48:38] <pavan> can someone help me
[19:58:04] <coldhead> pavan: i think jQuery strips out JS when you load ajax
[19:58:16] <coldhead> to prevent repeating itself
[19:58:27] <coldhead> you have to put the JS somewhere else and trigger it yourself
[20:01:37] <pavan> coldhead: so there is no way my jquery would work in the loaded tad?
[20:01:44] <pavan> i mean ajax loaded
[20:15:45] <ProLoser|Work> harro
[20:18:12] <ProLoser|Work> how can i figure out the # of items inside .each()
[20:19:05] <centr0> what are you .each()-ing?
[20:19:18] <ProLoser|Work> $('some selector')
[20:19:28] <Phrogz> $('some selector').length
[20:19:31] <ProLoser|Work> i'm just gonna cache it and view the length, whatever
[20:19:50] <centr0> .length?
[20:19:53] <Phrogz> Oh, I see,  you wanted to find the length during iteration.
[20:20:36] <Phrogz> centr0: I think he means       $('foo').each(function(){ // can I get the length here, or a handle to the collection as a whole? } );
[20:21:01] <Phrogz> Like he says, he knows you can       var foo = $('foo'); foo.each( function(){ ... foo.length } );
[20:23:22] <centr0> oic
[20:33:35] <justicefries> oh hell coldhead
[20:33:37] <justicefries> how are you?
[20:33:51] <tommyent> I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. I have a page with 4 vertical sections each of these sections has a sprite menu to navigate to the other sections of the page. I would like to have the icons to stay highlighted so that the visitors know exactly where they are on the page.
[20:35:01] <justicefries> hello
[20:35:02] <justicefries> rather.
[20:38:44] <xhtml_strict> Hi! Can someone tell my why the commented out line will not work here: http://jsfiddle.net/russianryebread/LUhm5/
[20:39:15] <taky> its not in the same scope
[20:39:34] <taky> outside of the .each put var length = '';
[20:39:42] <taky> and then length = whatever inside of the function
[20:39:49] <taky> and then the commented line will function properly
[20:39:52] <taky> brb
[20:42:45] <airportyh> c
[20:45:22] <taky> oh actually I'm wrong, i think the reason it doesn't work is just because its a protected word
[20:45:31] <taky> try using another variable name besides length
[20:46:02] <kborchers> xhtml_strict: the problem is you are trying to update length in the setTimeout but since the looping in the each finishes before the first setTimeout, your length is always 0 try this, though it seems a little crazy http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/LUhm5/5/
[20:47:57] <xhtml_strict> Thanks, taky and kborchers!  I'll try and figure out why it's jumping around!
[20:48:10] <xhtml_strict> I knew it was a duh moment. :)
[20:48:31] <taky> haven't used jq in awhile, sorry if I'm a little rusty
[20:48:32] <taky> hehe
[20:48:38] <kborchers> xhtml_strict: the jumping is because your setTimeouts end out of order based on the data-lengths
[20:48:42] <taky> using all native manipulation now since its so bulky
[20:50:04] <kborchers> they are all running at the same time, not sequentially .... try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/LUhm5/9/
[20:50:29] <kborchers> brb
[20:50:41] <jugstah> how do i check $this.val() == 1 or 2 or 3?
[20:50:53] <xhtml_strict> taky: yeah, I understand! :)
[20:51:00] <taky> $(this).val(); jugstah
[20:51:17] <taky> if($(this).val()=='1'){
[20:51:34] <jugstah> taky that last one yes
[20:51:38] <xhtml_strict> kborchers: Thanks, that is excellent!
[20:51:52] <jugstah> but if == '1' or '2' or '3'???
[20:52:06] <taky> switch($(this).val()){
[20:52:15] <taky> or you can use
[20:52:17] <jugstah> $this is loosely based on a select value
[20:52:35] <taky> if($(this).val()=='1' || $(this).val()=='2' || $(this).val()=='3'){
[20:52:49] <jugstah> hmm sweet
[20:52:53] <jugstah> i'l go try that
[20:53:04] <taky> but i wouldn't recommend doing your validation in javascript (unless your also doing it on the submit as well)
[20:53:37] <jugstah> im using the validate script to add required min/max to a textbox based on selected options
[20:56:48] <jugstah> ok im getting an error
[20:56:54] <jugstah> oh wait
[20:56:56] <jugstah> my bad
[20:56:56] <jugstah> brb
[20:57:24] <jugstah> taky ya da man thx
[20:58:16] <jugstah> now i need an else if here lessee
[21:18:30] <radiantstatic> As of right now, when my menu is completely closed, it is off center due to the width of #container. However, when it is open, it is centered. Is there away I can change the width of #container based on whether or not the accordion is open or closed? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/ww7UU/10/
[21:27:03] <radiantstatic> Anyone?
[21:40:36] <plunkin> radiantstatic, have you looked at the change event?
[21:42:17] <plunkin> nm... not using jqueryUI?
[21:44:55] <Shabana> Why would this statement give me an error in the new version of Jquery now: $('a.MTGdecks_prod').click(function(event) {
[21:45:03] <Shabana> It is saying $ is not a function
[21:45:28] <Shabana> Would appreciate any help. Thanks.
[21:48:32] <yanger> is it possible to control one window from another window? append text to window 1 from window 2
[21:49:07] <plunkin> shabana, i'm a total newb ... but i'll try.  do you have multiple js frameworks or are you trying to access $ before it's loaded?
[21:51:32] <Shabana> Plunkin: I am trying to make sense of someone else's code that they wrote in Jquery 1.4, it was working in that version, now I am using Jquery 1.5 and I am getting that error.
[21:51:38] <Shabana> So, that's what's confusing.
[21:52:18] <ajpiano> are you sure you properly included the new version of jQuery... there's no reason for $ to just stop working between upgrades
[21:55:19] <Shabana> I think I have it fixed with this statement at the beginning of all the code: (function ($) {
[21:55:42] <Shabana> and put this at the end of all the code: })(jQuery);
[21:55:48] <ajpiano> Shabana: is this in wordpress
[21:55:55] <Shabana> Drupal actually
[21:56:00] <coldhead> lololol
[21:56:05] <ajpiano> oh
[21:56:24] <ajpiano> is this a poop? no it's a turd
[21:56:25] <ajpiano> :p
[21:56:34] <Shabana> Heheh
[21:57:04] <coldhead> so offensive
[21:57:33] <Shabana> It's really confusing, I'm trying to upgrade Drupal to a new version and trying to work with a new version of Jquery as well.
[21:58:17] <coldhead> that's a hard road
[22:06:16] <austen> Just wrote a jQuery plugin for applying cross-browser CSS rotations (including MSIE annoying filter matrix properties). I don't have MSIE, would appreciate anyone who hase MSIE >= 5.5 test it out for me. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/simplyRotate
[22:06:35] <austen> s/hase/has
[22:12:42] <Shabana> Can you tell me if there's any problem with this statement: $('div.MTGdecks_deck').each( function(){
[22:13:21] <Shabana> For some reason, it is not getting called, it basically gets to this statement and then skips to the next function.
[22:14:45] <austen> Do you have a dangling "if" before the statement? I just had a similar issue earlier today. Missing a '{' in a previous if-else statement...
[22:15:20] <Shabana> No, I don't.
[22:15:34] <Shabana> Basically, it seems like, every function that starts with a $, it skips over
[22:16:40] <austen> do you have other libraries installed? Sometimes there are conflicts with overloading the $. Try substituting the '$' with 'jQuery' and see if it skips it then.
[22:19:34] <Shabana> Okay. Thanks.
[22:27:22] <saddishwasher> hi
[22:27:35] <rchavik> hi, having an issue with validation plugin and 'remote' rule described in http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1874465047.  would appreciate help in tracking issue down.
[22:30:45] <saddishwasher> rchavik: whats the issue?
[22:31:21] <saddishwasher> .seen bot-t
[22:31:21] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 28 minutes and 49 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: (37 secs ago) <gf3> tell gf3 It is so!
[22:31:35] <saddishwasher> bot-t: glad your back
[22:31:36] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Friday, 2011-05-27 - http://services.jquery.com/#jqueryui-dev_20110527.log.html
[22:31:38] <saddishwasher> :)
[22:31:47] <rchavik> the input is still invalid even though remote has returned 'true'
[22:32:07] <saddishwasher> bot-t: oh you! back to your old antics
[22:32:08] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Superdell back to his old antics  Joe the Web Guy - http://joethewebguy.net/2011/superdell-back-to-his-old-antics/
[23:10:46] <_jam> clearly I am doing something wrong. However, I have no idea what it is. I thought by specifying jsonpCallback, that function would be called and I would get the data
[23:10:48] <_jam> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/452959/
[23:10:57] <_jam> can I get a nudge in the right direction?
[23:20:40] <thamna> http://jsfiddle.net/r54DZ/ how can i get true value for option 2 ? var heya = $("#select option:selected").val(); this code everytime return to first select option value
[23:20:44] <coldhead> check ya later, bot-
[23:21:00] <brianpWins> Any reason a $('#my_form').change would fire twice everytime something changes?
[23:22:02] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[23:22:06] <Cros79> brianpWins: yes, if you have bound the event twice
[23:22:41] <brianpWins> Cros79: hmmm... I'll check around it's possible. but i don't *think* i have
[23:23:01] <Cros79> to check if that's the reason try unbinding change right before you bind it
[23:23:50] <Cros79> might also be that your change acctually registers as two separate changes
[23:24:00] <Cros79> hard to tell without more info
[23:26:06] <Cros79> brianpWins: could it be a bubble problem? if it's bound to the form, maybe it registers a change to a control as both a change to the control and to the form
[23:26:14] <Cros79> that's a bit of a guess tho
[23:26:29] <brianpWins> Cros79: you hit it on the nose. If i unbind before i bind it works fine. although I have no idea what or where would be binding to it elsewhere
[23:26:41] <Cros79> ok, good
[23:27:13] <Cros79> you only bind it in document.ready?
[23:27:38] <Cros79> is it an asp.net mvc app?
[23:28:50] <brianpWins> yeah only bind once in document.ready
[23:28:54] <brianpWins> not an asp app
[23:28:58] <brianpWins> it's a rails mvc app
[23:29:03] <Cros79> ok, then I have no clues
[23:29:20] <brianpWins> no worries. thanks for the spot on tip to get me going
[23:29:41] <brianpWins> I'm going to keep playing with it but at least that will work until i find out why
[23:29:46] <Cros79> might be that some partial part of the app actually triggers document.ready again for you
[23:30:05] <Cros79> we had that problem in an asp.mvc app
[23:30:15] <Cros79> cheers! yw
[23:31:02] <juha___> hello people
[23:31:06] <juha___> also, hello bots
[23:32:45] <coldhead> hello juha___
[23:52:25] <bricker> any ideas why this code is keeping me from typing in anything? changing "keypress" to "keyup" makes it work, but I'm checking for characters, not keyboard presses. http://pastie.org/2323853
