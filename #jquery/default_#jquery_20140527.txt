[00:00:17] <Zelpa> Cork: Alright so I've got it saving the current theme
[00:06:56] <Zelpa> Cork: Thank you so much dude, I realised what I was doing wrong and fixed it
[00:07:11] <Cork> Zelpa: np
[00:18:41] <Zelpa> Cork: With your theme switcher, in the CSS how would I change a div?
[00:18:56] <Cork> change div?
[00:19:02] <Zelpa> Yeah, using an ID
[00:19:07] <Cork> you mean style it?
[00:19:10] <Zelpa> yeah
[00:19:19] <Cork> body.<theme> #id {}
[00:19:28] <Zelpa> That's what I tried
[00:19:51] <Zelpa> But that doesn't work
[00:20:17] <Cork> it does
[00:21:42] <Zelpa> body.light #themelist {     background-color: #red; } doesn't work
[00:21:43] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/uMW2q/1/
[00:21:54] <oksushi> Zelpa: #red?
[00:22:11] <Zelpa> good catch, but even with an ID it doesnt work
[00:22:20] <Zelpa> wtf, now it does
[00:22:25] <Cork> sigh
[00:22:54] <Zelpa> Well that's weird
[00:23:19] <Zelpa> Hmm background-image doesn't work though
[00:23:23] <Zelpa> And that's what I'm trying to change
[00:23:35] <Cork> Zelpa: then make sure your css is valid
[00:24:17] <Zelpa>     background-image: url ('expand_arrow_dark.png'); just doesn't work at all
[00:24:58] <Zelpa> I think this might actually just be a problem with CSS
[00:25:36] <Cork> Zelpa: reproduce the problem in the fiddle
[01:25:49] <delboy1978uk> Hey guys I'm trying to register a .click() event, but it's on an element which has been ajaxed into the page, which i'm guessing is the reason it doesn't seem to register?
[01:30:12] <delboy1978uk> ah its cool, i just register the click event on GET success, cheers anyway guys, sometimes i feel just asking helps me answer my own question lol, the rubber duck technique
[01:45:18] <Elirips> Hello. With the tabs from jquery-ui, is there a nice method to change the index of a tab?
[02:13:47] <Elirips> How to select all children of id '123' that are of class 'foo'? Currently I use '$("#123").children(".foo"), but could I write that in one selector?
[02:14:15] <Segaja> $('#123 > .foo')
[02:14:19] <Segaja> if it is a direct child
[02:14:32] <Segaja> or without the > if it is somewhere under the #123 object
[02:16:01] <Elirips> Segaja: thank you
[02:16:08] <Segaja> np
[02:16:19] <Segaja> css one on one :)
[02:16:26] <Uhkis> Elirips: your original is faster tho
[02:16:32] <Elirips> Is there also a way to select the root element and the children in one selector?
[02:16:56] <Cork> Elirips: no
[02:16:59] <Segaja> Uhkis: really? Jquery functions are faster the native CSS selectors?
[02:17:13] <Uhkis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3177763/what-is-the-fastest-method-for-selecting-descendant-elements-in-jquery
[02:17:19] <Cork> Elirips: you can do $('#123').find('.foo').addBack()
[02:17:34] <mariuscc> does anyone saw this somewhere ? http://guyswithabs.com/Tumblr/index.php , there's a pop-up, don't click the close button ( is a hidden facebook like ), that modal box I saw it on multiple sites but I got now clue from where
[02:17:38] <Elirips> Cork: thanks, but thats too complicated
[02:17:52] <Cork> Segaja: .children is basically native
[02:18:23] <Cork> but ya $('#123 > .foo') and $('#123').children('.foo') shouldn't be much of a difference
[02:19:19] <Cork> Elirips: but what speed you get from what depends heavily on the construct of the page
[02:19:40] <Cork> so generic "this is faster then that" is risky
[02:20:13] <Elirips> speed does not matter much, its more important for me to understand whats going on if I look at the source again in one year
[02:20:32] <Cork> Elirips: that is what you should aim for anyway
[02:21:04] <Uhkis> // I wonder what these are for
[02:21:07] <Cork> Elirips: the reason $('#id > .class') is slower then $('#id').children('.class') is cause the first one is a full selector
[02:21:22] <Cork> so it first selects all elements matching the class
[02:21:35] <Cork> and then filters out the ones that has a direct parent matching #id
[02:21:51] <Cork> while the second one selects the id from the id hash table in the browser
[02:22:00] <Cork> and from that loops over the children
[02:22:11] <Cork> it can't really ever me faster then knowing :)
[02:22:35] <Elirips> ah nice explanation. and its way more readable - at least for me, as I never know about the selectors syntax..$
[02:22:38] <Uhkis> it can't WHAT? :D
[02:23:15] <Cork> Elirips: the selectors you give jquery is basically just piped forward to document.querySelectorAll
[02:23:37] <Cork> Elirips: and it uses the same engine the browser uses when you give it a css resource to style the page
[02:24:03] <Cork> ugg..
[02:24:10] <Cork> ever BE faster then knowing -_-'
[02:24:34] <Uhkis> than ;-)
[02:52:54] <netiul> can i add a listener that's already been fired and jquery is executing the listeners?
[02:53:40] <netiul> like, in the first listener i add another listener, so its the last to get executed
[02:53:49] <Cork> netiul: no
[02:54:03] <netiul> i was afraid so 8)
[02:54:32] <Cork> netiul: you can fire a fake event if you really have to though
[02:56:01] <netiul> Cork, yeah but its execution should depend on the original event propagation
[02:56:54] <Cork> netiul: hmm that would technically be possible
[02:56:54] <netiul> that should be possible i guess
[02:56:58] <netiul> :)
[02:57:02] <Cork> though i haven't done it in many years
[02:57:06] <Cork> (90's even)
[02:57:10] <Cork> give me a min
[02:57:45] <netiul> well, i've a reference to the original event,so I could check the flag stopPropagation (or so)
[02:57:54] <netiul> interesting
[02:59:00] <Cork> netiul: http://jsfiddle.net/h8G4k/
[02:59:02] <netiul> but it still needs to be executed when all handlers of the original event are executed
[02:59:40] <Cork> netiul: but it only works if you add the listener to a parent
[02:59:54] <Cork> it can't be done on the same element as the handler adding the listener
[03:00:42] <netiul> Cork, hm, nice, I can build upon that
[03:00:51] <netiul> i see, but shouldnt be a problem
[03:01:13] <Cork> netiul: that said, you should be able to build the site in a way where you don't need this
[03:01:31] <Cork> adding and removing handlers is something you normally want to avoid
[03:01:47] <netiul> http://jsfiddle.net/h8G4k/1/
[03:02:02] <Cork> ya
[03:02:10] <beepbeep_> Anyone here use the DataTables plugin?
[03:02:12] <Cork> if you stop the bubbling you can't fire parent handlers
[03:02:25] <Cork> netiul: also you shouldn't use return false;
[03:02:28] <Cork> like ever
[03:03:07] <netiul> Cork, it snouldnt be executed when propgation is stopped, so its could behavior
[03:03:20] <beepbeep_> Have wasted hours trying to retrieve a column name by index (DataTables plugin), looks like a lot of people use it so I'm trying here.. :)
[03:03:26] <Cork> netiul: then use stopPropagation()
[03:03:32] <netiul> Cork, better? http://jsfiddle.net/h8G4k/2/
[03:03:36] <netiul> :)
[03:03:51] <Cork> netiul: i would do it the first thing in the handler
[03:03:53] <Cork> but ya, much
[03:05:13] <netiul> Cork, yes, but it could also be done in a different handler
[03:05:29] <netiul> http://jsfiddle.net/h8G4k/3/
[03:05:31] <Cork> netiul: what do you mean?
[03:05:42] <Cork> sure
[03:05:50] <Cork> if you stop propagation you stop propagation
[03:05:56] <Cork> the parent element doesn't know about the event
[03:06:02] <Cork> so it can't fire the handlers
[03:06:19] <Cork> there isn't a way around that except refiering the event
[03:06:28] <netiul> it's perfect
[03:06:34] <netiul> just what i needed
[03:07:22] <netiul> http://jsfiddle.net/h8G4k/5/
[03:07:25] <netiul> Cork, thanks!
[03:09:10] <netiul> Cork, about this kind of solution not being needed, it's kinda complex
[03:09:29] <Cork> netiul: ya, i know been there
[03:09:48] <Cork> netiul: but from experience one should REALLY try to avoid stopPropagation
[03:10:02] <Cork> and that normally fixes the need for hacks like this
[03:11:16] <netiul> Cork, agreed
[03:11:39] <netiul> fact is that propagation is sometimes stopped (3rd party code)
[03:12:23] <Cork> netiul: ya, i'm very restrictive to what third party code i let in to the projects i work on for exactly this reason
[03:12:30] <netiul> :)
[03:12:37] <Cork> they have to behave or i refuse them
[03:24:04] <ns5> Could anyone help to explain?  I'm a js newbie.  http://ur1.ca/hdyzk  what is $(iq) in the on_roster function?  Is it jquery or the iq parameter of the function?
[03:24:53] <Cork> ns5: most likely either a selector or a dom element
[03:25:03] <Cork> i don't see where its called from so a bit hard to say
[03:25:04] <beepbeep_> Hey all, is anyone here using datatables?
[03:25:37] <Cork> ns5: find what calls on_roster and you should have the answer
[03:25:50] <Cork> ns5: actually
[03:26:00] <Cork> ns5: based on find('item') it looks like its an xml document
[03:27:32] <ns5> Cork: The function takes an 'iq' parameter.   But what does $(iq) mean?
[03:27:54] <Cork> ns5: it takes whats in iq and wrappes it in a jquery wrapper
[03:28:10] <Cork> so you can run jquery functions on it
[03:29:43] <ns5> Cork: so $() magically wraps something into a jquery object so we can use jquery functions on it?  I don't understand.  Could you point me to some docs
[03:29:53] <ns5> BTW, the full js file is here: https://github.com/metajack/profxmpp/blob/master/ch06/gab.html
[03:29:57] <Cork> ns5: well except the magical part ya
[03:30:39] <Cork> ns5: that is the html not what is passed to the on_roster function
[03:30:56] <Cork> i suspect its data from an ajax call
[03:31:19] <ns5> Cork: sorry, this one: https://github.com/metajack/profxmpp/blob/master/ch06/gab.js
[03:32:25] <Cork> so iq is $iq({type: 'get'}).c('query', {xmlns: 'jabber:iq:roster'});
[03:32:37] <Cork> so ya, looks like some xml stream
[03:34:22] <jrm2k6> Hi guys, I have this issue http://jsfiddle.net/4gQkT/7/
[03:34:26] <ns5> Cork: so for an xml string, wrap it with $() and you can use jquery find() on it?
[03:34:39] <jrm2k6> I want to parent having pointer-events"none to detect mousenter/mouseleave
[03:34:51] <jrm2k6> but still keep the clicks on it to go throught
[03:34:52] <Cork> ns5: if it is an xml string it $() will parse it to a document and wrapp that
[03:34:54] <jrm2k6> through*
[03:35:00] <jrm2k6> What would be the way to do it?
[03:35:06] <Cork> ns5: if it is already a parsed string (dom document) it will use that
[03:35:17] <Cork> ns5: so either way it will work with the xml as a dom
[03:35:59] <Cork> jrm2k6: there isn't a way to separate those
[03:36:14] <Cork> jrm2k6: if you want click to work you need to remove the pointer-event; none
[03:36:17] <jrm2k6> So I should just attach listeners to all event and stop the propagation
[03:36:26] <padonak1294> hi
[03:36:30] <jrm2k6> when i dont want them to go further
[03:36:41] <Cork> jrm2k6: not really, just check event.target == this and do nothing if it isn't
[03:36:42] <padonak1294> any p2p web frameworks available?
[03:36:56] <jrm2k6> yes
[03:36:58] <jrm2k6> i see
[03:37:11] <jrm2k6> just wanted to know if it would have been less manual than that
[03:37:13] <jrm2k6> thank you!
[03:37:17] <jrm2k6> gonna give it a try
[03:40:21] <ns5> Cork: I used alert(iq) to print the iq parameter of the on_roster callback.  And it's just 'object element'.  How to dump the content of the variable?
[03:40:44] <Cork> ns5: console.log(iq)
[03:40:54] <Cork> don't use alert for debugging
[03:42:14] <vedic> I have DOM structure as: <div id='1'> <a id='1a'>Clear all</a></div> In this structure, I dynamically add some elements before the start of <a id='1a'> but after <div ..>. I want to show the "Clear all" if there are any elements between <div> and <a id='1a'> but hide "Clear all" if there are no elements between <div> and <a id='1a'>
[03:42:52] <Cork> vedic: make a jsfiddle
[03:44:02] <Voyage> alert (   $("#byDest-txtDateDepart").datepicker("getDate")   );         gives me Mon Jun 30 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0500 (PKT).      Hi
[03:44:05] <Voyage> sory
[03:44:19] <Voyage> ignore above said
[03:44:26] <Voyage> I am doing alert ( ($("#as_byDest-city-from ul li")[0]).val() );  is that ok?
[03:44:28] <jrm2k6> Cork: actually, how can i force the propagation?
[03:44:37] <Cork> jrm2k6: you can't
[03:44:46] <Cork> if it's stopped its stopped
[03:44:53] <Voyage> need to get value of first LI in the UL of #as_by...
[03:45:56] <ns5> Cork: The data is an 'XML DOM element'.  What is an xml dom element?  Is it an html page?
[03:46:17] <Cork> ns5: no like i said it is xml parsed to a document
[03:48:06] <vedic> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/L6Ldj/
[03:48:26] <Cork> vedic: before i start
[03:48:29] <Cork> never do div#1
[03:48:40] <Cork> your creating a slow selector for no reason what so ever
[03:49:19] <vedic> Cork: If there is anything between div and a#1a, then I want to show "Clear all" else hide "Clear all"
[03:49:50] <vedic> Cork: div#1 is slow? What should be used according to you?
[03:50:06] <Cork> vedic: does this work for you http://jsfiddle.net/L6Ldj/1/ ?
[03:50:37] <Cork> vedic: remove the "div" part
[03:50:47] <Cork> vedic: $("div#1") => $("#1")
[03:51:14] <vedic> Cork: ok
[03:51:21] <Cork> vedic: a little cleaned up version http://jsfiddle.net/L6Ldj/2/
[03:52:54] <vedic> Cork: I want to hide "Clear all" if there is nothing between #1 and #clear.
[03:53:12] <vedic> Cork: If I remove prepend, still I see clear all
[03:53:12] <Cork> vedic: comment out the js command
[03:53:17] <Cork> uh...
[03:54:00] <Cork> ah right
[03:54:05] <Cork> 1 isn't a valid id
[03:54:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/L6Ldj/3/
[03:54:55] <vedic> Cork: Thats great. Why 1 is not a valid id?
[03:55:15] <Cork> vedic: only numeric
[03:55:34] <vedic> Cork: I see so id should be alphanumeric not just numeric
[03:55:40] <Cork> right
[03:55:51] <Cork> i need to test something
[03:56:05] <padonak1294> hi
[03:56:08] <Cork> i know the rules has changed a bit so i need to sort out what was the old rules and what is the new ones
[03:56:15] <padonak1294> does js support server sockets inside browser yet?
[03:56:41] <m1su> just "1" should be valid in html5
[03:56:44] <vedic> Cork: Thanks. Learned quite a few things in just few minutes.
[03:57:39] <Cork> vedic: http://jsfiddle.net/SBKkP/
[03:57:49] <Cork> so your not allowed to start with a number
[03:58:12] <Cork> [a-z].* is ok
[03:58:21] <vedic> Cork: Got disconnected.
[03:58:27] <vedic> Did you send any msg?
[03:58:30] <Cork> vedic: http://jsfiddle.net/SBKkP/
[03:58:32] <Cork> so your not allowed to start with a number
[03:58:34] <Cork> [a-z].* is ok
[03:59:58] <vedic> Cork: [a-z]+[0-9]* ?
[04:00:13] <Cork> vedic: no it doens't have to be a number
[04:00:23] <Cork> the first char has to be alpha
[04:00:41] <Cork> or rather the first character can't be a number
[04:00:46] <vedic> Cork: Yea, so I is the '+' (one or more) and for digit '*' (zero or more)
[04:00:50] <Cork> but i think most any other char is ok
[04:01:08] <vedic> Cork: I see, any other char
[04:01:15] <vedic> then its .*
[04:01:16] <Cork> vedic: so the correct regex would be [^0-9].*
[04:01:32] <vedic> Cork: yea
[04:02:28] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/SBKkP/1/
[04:02:47] <Cork> even space is ok as the first character :)
[04:02:52] <Cork> just not 0-9 ^^'
[04:04:12] <shilon> Hey there, good morning everyone!
[04:04:40] <shilon> I’m using this plunkr to create a login template and a main page template http://plnkr.co/edit/8rUUtF?p=preview
[04:05:05] <shilon> Im wondering why isn’t it loading the ng view after login?
[04:05:21] <shilon> even if I add it inside the home.html it doesn’t load anything
[04:05:48] <vedic> Cork: btw, the CSS part in http://jsfiddle.net/L6Ldj/3/ . How that can be generated from jquery?
[04:06:02] <Cork> vedic: it can't
[04:06:18] <Cork> vedic: jquery .css works on inline css (the style tag)
[04:06:26] <vedic> I see
[04:06:34] <Cork> and it doesn't have psudo-selectors
[04:08:20] <shilon> I want to load inside home.html a default ng view after login
[04:08:24] <shilon> is this possible?
[04:08:38] <vedic> Cork: Is it possible to generate the same effect by adding inline css via jquery?
[04:09:02] <Cork> vedic: you would have to run code you invoke every time you add or remove an element
[04:09:14] <Cork> vedic: so basically not really
[04:09:51] <vedic> Cork: Actually I would like to add something via jquery that does the same thing instead of css. CSS is something I am not allowed to modify
[04:10:10] <Cork> ...
[04:10:13] <Cork> vedic: lovely
[04:10:25] <Cork> ok, then you need to create a "check_state" function
[04:10:35] <Cork> and do a $('div').length
[04:10:45] <vedic> Cork: I see
[04:10:46] <Cork> if it is > 1 you should hide the clear all
[04:10:50] <Cork> and if it isn't show it
[04:11:02] <Cork> then you need to call this function every time you add or remove an element
[04:11:17] <Cork> basically you have to replicate the browsers built behavior in js...
[04:11:28] <vedic> Cork: I think its reverse. If it is >1 then show and other wise hide
[04:11:36] <Cork> vedic: or just tell the one setting that stupid rule to add a css rule to solve the problem
[04:11:49] <Cork> vedic: ah, sorry correct
[04:11:55] <vedic> Cork: Got it
[04:13:27] <shilon> http://plnkr.co/edit/8rUUtF?p=preview Anyone knows how can I load a default ng view after login?
[04:13:56] <andrewcowley> Is it ok to post a link to a SO question that hasn't been answered in here?
[04:15:01] <Cork> andrewcowley: it isn't exactly forbidden, but if you've asked on SO you should expect the answer from SO
[04:15:54] <andrewcowley> It's been a few days and it hasn't got an answer
[04:16:49] <d0de> I'm trying to sanitize some input from RSS feeds. One option is just to use input.text() but that (obviously) strips out the paragraph breaks. Is there something I can do to reinsert <p> tags at the appropriate places?
[04:16:51] <Cork> andrewcowley: you're free to ask the question here
[04:17:13] <metallico> hi guys, any idea why is this not highlighting before deleting in Safari and iOS mobile safari? Works ok in other browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/WURQA/2/
[04:17:32] <andrewcowley> Cork: Great!
[04:17:36] <Cork> d0de: not if you use .text()
[04:18:13] <d0de> actually, scratch that, there are deeper problems with using text().
[04:18:21] <d0de> oops, yeah
[04:19:03] <d0de> ok, is there some way I can selectively remove some elements and leave others? e.g. remove iframes, nested divs, images but leave links, paragraphs, headers etc
[04:19:36] <d0de> I guess I can just run find() a few times?
[04:22:12] <andrewcowley> I want to use .ajax() to make a get request to a URL similar to the one in this pastebin http://pastebin.com/rVBKjxLN
[04:22:37] <andrewcowley> but the second parameter is just an object without a name
[04:26:35] <andrewcowley> so I'm not sure how to use the data key within the ajax object to reference it
[04:27:08] <andrewcowley> I've tried the following http://pastebin.com/GHmysAux
[04:28:13] <metallico> this fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/WURQA/3/
[04:31:42] <seutje> andrewcowley: don't think it will enjoy a key consisting of a space
[04:32:07] <seutje> andrewcowley: were you looking to use an array, perhaps?
[04:32:28] <andrewcowley> I'm not too sure
[04:32:44] <seutje> that example request looks odd
[04:32:52] <andrewcowley> it is odd
[04:32:58] <seutje> it's like json in the GET parameters, but without  a key
[04:33:00] <andrewcowley> hence why I'm having issues :S
[04:33:12] <andrewcowley> exactly @seutje
[04:33:33] <andrewcowley> that's where I'm struggling
[04:33:47] <andrewcowley> it is a valid request to that URL
[04:34:30] <Cork> andrewcowley: something like $.ajax('http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webservice.server.pl', { dataType: 'jsonp', data: JSON.stringify(object), processData: false, jsonp: 'jsonpCallback' });
[04:34:36] <Cork> should work
[04:36:51] <seutje> their docs just keep referencing themselves
[04:37:01] <seutje> "Please visit http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webservice.server.pl for detailed documentation."
[04:37:18] <seutje> which just links back to http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webservice.wsdl
[04:37:41] <andrewcowley> yes, it's weird
[04:37:49] <seutje> gov...
[04:38:41] <andrewcowley> Here's a url with a full response:
[04:38:42] <andrewcowley> http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webservice.server.pl?jsoncallback=printData&{%22function%22:%22get_ts_traces%22,%22version%22:1,%22params%22:{%22site_list%22:%22FILTER(TSFILES(PROV),BETWEEN(212063,212069))%22,%22start_time%22:%2220140414000000%22,%22end_time%22:%2220140424000000%22,%22varfrom%22:%22100%22,%22varto%22:%22100%22,%22interval%22:%22hour%22,%22datasource%22:%22CP%22,%22data_type%22:%22mean%22,%22multi
[04:38:43] <andrewcowley> lier%22:%221%22}}
[04:39:21] <seutje> wtf object did you stringify?
[04:40:09] <seutje> oh wait, just has more than the pastebin
[04:40:30] <andrewcowley> Cork: that's not quite working
[04:40:50] <Cork> andrewcowley: what part isn't working?
[04:42:28] <andrewcowley> Cork: it gets a 302 from the server
[04:42:41] <Cork> a redirect??
[04:42:46] <Cork> that shouldn't matter
[04:42:57] <Cork> what is the ending result?
[04:43:13] <andrewcowley> ah ok
[04:43:21] <andrewcowley> it get's redirected to here http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webhyd.pl?soapws_show_header
[04:45:01] <andrewcowley> Cork: I can make a request and have the callback run successfully if I just build the url via concatenation and then append a script tag to the head of the document
[04:45:24] <Cork> so the server expect the json to not be escaped??
[04:45:31] <Cork> yay for broken apis
[04:45:51] <seutje> that's why I went looking for documentation of any sorts, but it just loops in on itself :(
[04:46:06] <d0de> I don't really know how to use fragments. What's the correct syntax? I tried "var f = document.createDocumentFragment(); f.html( myStuffHere );" but it doesn't work.
[04:46:09] <seutje> the only documentation seems to be "send this guy an e-mail and pray"
[04:46:52] <Cork> andrewcowley: actually no...
[04:47:05] <Cork> andrewcowley: check the browser console and compare the two generated urls
[04:47:27] <Cork> d0de: fragments isn't a jquery object
[04:47:35] <seutje> yeah, it's like a Node
[04:47:40] <seutje> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment
[04:47:44] <Cork> d0de: you most likely just want $('<html>')
[04:48:02] <andrewcowley> Cork: Which two URLs sorry?
[04:48:07] <Cork> or possibly $($.parseHTML('<html>')) if you want to be sure
[04:48:21] <Cork> andrewcowley: the only (not working) from $.ajax, and the working one you made
[04:48:45] <Cork> andrewcowley: cause the one you posted here looks fine to me
[04:49:00] <seutje> going all innerHTML on ur fragment kinda defeats the purpose anyway
[04:49:35] <d0de> Cork, I'm trying to process very long strings that contain html and text. I want to be able to do $(string).text().length to get the length of the text rather than the markup
[04:49:46] <d0de> but jQuery is sometimes choking on that
[04:49:54] <andrewcowley> Cork: That long one is fine. I can't make the request work by using .ajax though
[04:50:02] <d0de> it works some of the time, but some syntax causes errors
[04:50:20] <d0de> I thought that using a fragment might eliminate the rrors
[04:51:15] <Cork> andrewcowley: the url you posted here gives me an error from the server
[04:51:48] <Cork> d0de: no, it is still dome
[04:51:51] <andrewcowley> Cork: what is the error?
[04:51:52] <Cork> *dom
[04:52:10] <Cork> "Parameter error(s) for function get_ts_traces:Missing: multiplier; Unsupported: multilier"
[04:54:19] <d0de> Cork, ty. Currently I use " var x = $(string); x = string.text().length " which works 95% of the time, but it seems to break whenever there are asterisks (*) in the string
[04:54:44] <Cork> d0de: use $($.parseHTML(string))
[04:54:45] <d0de> I get "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: * POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * "
[04:54:50] <Cork> ya
[04:54:55] <Cork> jquery thinks its a selector
[04:55:00] <Cork> so $.parseHTML
[04:55:11] <andrewcowley> Cork: Try this http://realtimedata.water.nsw.gov.au/cgi/webservice.server.pl?jsoncallback=printData&{"function":"get_ts_traces","version":1,"params":{"site_list":"FILTER(TSFILES(PROV),BETWEEN(212063,212069))","start_time":"20140414000000","end_time":"20140424000000","varfrom":"100","varto":"100","interval":"hour","datasource":"CP","data_type":"mean","multiplier":"1"}}
[04:55:22] <andrewcowley> that is the data I'm after
[04:56:10] <d0de> Cork, perfect, thanks
[04:57:34] <andrewcowley> Cork: if I do: var script = document.createElement('script');
[04:57:34] <andrewcowley> script.src = 'http://domain.com/?function=hooray';
[04:57:35] <andrewcowley> document.body.appendChild(script);
[04:57:44] <andrewcowley> I have no problems
[04:58:00] <andrewcowley> but I can't get it to work using .ajax()
[04:59:21] <Cork> andrewcowley: http://jsfiddle.net/4yAt9/
[05:00:57] <andrewcowley> Cork: haha, thank you!
[05:01:17] <Cork> andrewcowley: that is almost exactly what i gave you before ^^'
[05:02:15] <andrewcowley> Cork: OK, thanks for your patience anyway. That has been bugging me for a few hours
[05:07:57] <d0de> My input is an html string. I turn it into an object and use find().remove() to strip out elements I don't want. I then turn it into a string again, check the length, and use substr() to shorten it if it's over a certain threshold. How can I make sure that I don't end the string half-way through a tag?
[05:08:27] <Cork> d0de: what?
[05:09:16] <d0de> my html is in a string and I want to shorten it. But I want to avoid input "<p>The quick brown fox</p>" becoming output "<p>The quick brown fox</"
[05:09:36] <d0de> because presumably the half tag will mess up the markup on the rest of the page
[05:09:41] <Cork> d0de: if your working with dom you won't have that problem
[05:10:33] <Cork> var fragment = $($.parseHTML(string)); fragment.filter('iframe').remove(); fragment.find('iframe').remove()
[05:10:58] <d0de> Cork, how can I shorten the length if I leave the input as an object? the only way I know how to shorten it is to transform the html to a string and use substr()
[05:11:04] <Cork> $('<div>').html(fragment).html() will give you the valid html string
[05:11:20] <Cork> d0de: not sure what you mean by "shorten"
[05:11:32] <Cork> you want to limit how many chars they are allowed to enter?
[05:12:05] <d0de> I want to take an input that's html markup around text of arbitrary length, and output text of a max char count but still correctly wrapped in valid markup
[05:12:28] <Cork> d0de: that isn't a simple thing to do
[05:12:35] <d0de> hrm, ok
[05:12:49] <Cork> you would basically have to remove text from the last dom element
[05:13:00] <Cork> and then figure out if you want to remove the empty dom elements or not
[05:13:16] <Cork> (meaning not removing <img> <br> and so on)
[05:13:34] <seutje> https://github.com/pathable/truncate
[05:13:40] <d0de> well only the text inside p elements should count towards the char count
[05:13:44] <d0de> in this case
[05:14:22] <Cork> d0de: sure but i meant <p>123456></p><br><p>789</p>
[05:14:40] <Cork> hmm bad example
[05:15:04] <Cork> d0de: sure but i meant <p>123</p><br><p>456</p><p>789</p>
[05:15:14] <Cork> ig you only allow 5 chars what elements should be removed?
[05:15:26] <Cork> ig==if
[05:16:05] <seutje> that truncate things seems pretty solid
[05:16:35] <seutje> just saying, this is rather complex, might wanna pick up a wheel that runs already
[05:16:40] <d0de> ideally I'd write something that would remove the last p element completely, and edit the text of the second
[05:16:40] <Cork> ya, i would prob use a plugin for that
[05:16:47] <d0de> hrm, fair enough
[05:17:01] <Cork> it is a quite long list of nasty rules to keep track of to get that right
[05:17:03] <seutje> truncate would do that, and it will probably leave the BR as-is
[05:17:28] <seutje> only open issue is some obscure dependency thing when installing from bower
[05:17:58] <seutje> If noBreaks is truthy the input will contain no break elements.
[05:18:01] <seutje> oh, there u go :D
[05:18:15] <seutje> should be "output", but alright
[05:19:14] <d0de> I am bad at distinguishing things that will be hard from things that will be easy
[05:19:41] <MikeD_> d0de: i scrolled back far enough to suggest that what you are trying to do is probably so difficult because you probably shouldn't even be doing it.
[05:19:56] <seutje> just defining this functionally is quite the chore
[05:20:16] <MikeD_> (i say probably a lot because i didn't scroll all the way back and my opinion is just that)
[05:20:27] <seutje> maybe you should just provide them a contentEditable div :P
[05:20:45] <d0de> hrm
[05:21:08] <PhonicUK> this is weird
[05:21:22] <seutje> welcome to the webs!
[05:21:24] <PhonicUK> keycode of enter == 13, keycode for ctrl+enter == 13 :\
[05:21:28] <PhonicUK> er 10 rather
[05:21:32] <seutje> ctrl is a modifier
[05:21:50] <seutje> or wait, it's like an exception with return, innit?
[05:21:59] <PhonicUK> thats what I'm wondering
[05:22:10] <PhonicUK> I was expecting ctrl+enter to be keycode 13 with ctrlKey = true
[05:22:13] <PhonicUK> but its not, its keycode 10
[05:23:03] <d0de> I could probably get away with deleting everything after a closing </p> tag of the paragraph that pushes the char count over the limit
[05:23:05] <MikeD_> 10 is a linefeed
[05:23:06] <seutje> weird, still get 13 here (OSX + chrome)
[05:23:12] <Cork> PhonicUK: http://jsfiddle.net/deJ85/
[05:23:15] <d0de> i.e. never break inside an element
[05:23:31] <Cork> not sure what the compatibility is through it is quite new
[05:23:38] <seutje> event.key?
[05:23:44] <Cork> ya
[05:23:52] <PhonicUK> undefined, is keycode
[05:23:55] <PhonicUK> also this is jq 1.x
[05:24:03] <Cork> beh...
[05:24:08] <Cork> firefox and ie only...
[05:24:12] <Cork> wow...
[05:25:03] <PhonicUK> I can reproduce it
[05:25:10] <PhonicUK> http://jsfiddle.net/K6NhF/
[05:25:21] <PhonicUK> Chrome 35 under Windows
[05:25:23] <Elirips> Is there any guarantee on the order how elements are returned from a selector? Maybe the same order as they appear in the dom?
[05:25:27] <PhonicUK> ctrl+enter is keycode 10
[05:25:45] <seutje> I get all the "Ctrl+Enter (13) "
[05:25:52] <PhonicUK> what platform?
[05:26:12] <seutje> still OSX, didn't change in the past 2 minutes
[05:26:24] <PhonicUK> anyone with a Windows box that can confirm what I'm seeing?
[05:26:49] <Cork> PhonicUK: works on linux too
[05:26:55] <Cork> one min and i'll boot my vm
[05:27:03] <seutje> whoa, just loaded fiddle on IE8 mode
[05:27:26] <Elirips> for example if I have something like '<ul id="u"><li id="l1"/><li id="l2"/></ul>' and I select using something like '$("#l1").find(".li"), will the returned selector guarantee that the elements in its array are ordered using index 0 = l1 and index 1 = l2, or is that just random?
[05:27:47] <seutje> haha, it even hijacks alt+enter on windoze
[05:27:59] <seutje> PhonicUK: yeah, I get 10 on the IEs
[05:28:04] <PhonicUK> right
[05:28:11] <PhonicUK> so I'm not going bonkers
[05:28:18] <seutje> nah, IE is
[05:28:25] <PhonicUK> I'm using Chrome
[05:28:28] <seutje> only tried it in a 9
[05:28:37] <seutje> oh, it's os-wide :x
[05:28:53] <seutje> don't think I have anything but IE on this box
[05:29:25] <seutje> lolwat? use keyDown and it'll be 13 instead of 10 on ctrl+ enter
[05:29:51] <seutje> and still with ctrlKey
[05:29:56] <Cork> keydown compared to what?
[05:30:18] <seutje> keypress
[05:30:29] <Cork> ah
[05:30:33] <seutje> keypress logs 10, keydown logs 13 for ctrl + enter on windows
[05:30:36] <Cork> keypress is depricated
[05:30:41] <Cork> and shouldn't be used at all
[05:30:51] <seutje> doesn't jQuery massage the method?
[05:31:00] <seutje> oh wait, the fiddle loda a 2.x
[05:31:02] <seutje> loads
[05:31:36] <seutje> that doesn't seem to change anything though
[05:31:47] <seutje> PhonicUK: so yeah, just use keydown instead?
[05:36:18] <alpic> ehcache uses pointer or copy value
[05:38:39] <djangonoob> hi, I know this is a jquery channel but mby u can help me. I have problems with twitter-bootstrap tooltips inside an input-group.   http://pastebin.com/Aq7ei8fL
[05:44:38] <seutje> djangonoob: I don't see any tooltips besides the native ones http://www.bootply.com/L5ZmqfbThc
[05:48:14] <djangonoob> seutje, I forgot two things in my paste: 1) I have a $(".tooltip-elem").tooltip(); 2) I want to see the tooltips on disabled inputs
[05:48:34] <seutje> not sure if disabled elements even trigger a hover
[05:48:42] <djangonoob> seutje, the tooltip for the button is working
[05:48:48] <djangonoob> in disabled state
[05:48:51] <seutje> http://www.bootply.com/SzyZMY8e7t
[05:48:54] <seutje> seems to work...
[05:50:01] <djangonoob> seutje, yeah when they get enabled, but then I see them in the middle of the two inputs
[05:50:25] <djangonoob> I want to see them in the middle above one input
[05:54:29] <seutje> the placement is relative to the element the tooltip is on, so you can't really have it be over the middle of another element
[05:57:09] <seutje> djangonoob: or is this what you wanted? http://www.bootply.com/cujvhslgWD
[05:57:43] <seutje> gotta love how that one on the button causes a scrollbar
[05:57:51] <seutje> v3.1.1 ffs...
[06:03:15] <djangonoob> seutje, very nice this is almost what I want. but I want to display them on disabled inputs. I am trying something...
[06:12:04] <seutje> djangonoob: good luck with that! http://jsfiddle.net/sH9C7/
[06:12:33] <seutje> if ur gonna add ur own wrapper to put the tooltip on, it will probably need q bit of css-massage
[06:15:21] <seutje> guess u could use readonly instead, but not really the same thing
[06:16:20] <MikeD_> var listItem = $("<div id='" + tabId + "' class='tab'></div>");  <-- if only there was more time to fix code when I find it like this
[06:17:33] <seutje> djangonoob: or here, have a hack! http://jsfiddle.net/t9Bt5/1/
[06:21:58] <decx> passing the offset() object directly to css(), clever ^^
[06:23:52] <airdem> var foo = function() {} <-- how do i call this inside another function?
[06:25:56] <Cork> airdem: foo()
[06:26:15] <Cork> if the variable is accessable from there scope
[06:26:22] <Cork> else you need to get it to its scope
[06:26:47] <djangonoob> seutje, thank you so much helping. can you please try something. http://pastebin.com/ajXZQ1SP (sry for not using bootply, I was trying)
[06:27:04] <MikeD_> Cork: how do you "get it to its scope" ?
[06:27:35] <Cork> MikeD_: you set the variable in a shared scope; or you pass it as an argument to a function
[06:27:39] <Cork> or you set it on an object
[06:27:41] <Cork> or arrays
[06:27:43] <Cork> or...
[06:28:13] <MikeD_> oh right, just wasn't imagining it was any of those mundane choices (was expecting some kind of elfin magic)
[06:28:17] <Cork> MikeD_: basically the same way you pass any value
[06:28:34] <djangonoob> seutje, wait I just saw that in bootply it is displayed different like with my server
[06:29:26] <seutje> djangonoob: probably wanna remove those inline styles
[06:30:19] <d0de> I have a string x. I do " var y = $(x) " and then do some stuff with y. How can I get the string back out when I'm done?
[06:31:20] <Cork> d0de: you normally shouldn't do that
[06:31:38] <Cork> d0de: but you can do $('<div>').html(y).html()
[06:34:24] <d0de> Thanks Cork. This is starting to make my head hurt.
[06:34:36] <Cork> d0de: why do you need the html back again?
[06:35:28] <d0de> Cork, at the moment I'm trying to count the number of p elements
[06:35:46] <d0de> so I have the HTML string x
[06:35:49] <Cork> d0de: so do .find('p').length
[06:36:07] <Cork> or .filter('p') if there isn't a parent
[06:37:18] <d0de> Yeah, that works, thanks. I'm getting confused because I'm not used to dealing with stuff that isn't already in the DOM
[06:38:04] <d0de> what I'm trying to do is count the number of p elements, and then truncate to the first 4 p elements if there are more than 4
[06:38:28] <Cork> d0de: does everything have to be in p elements?
[06:38:34] <Cork> cause then it is fairly simple
[06:38:36] <xec> .slice(0, 4) ?
[06:39:45] <Cork> $('<p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p>').filter('p').slize(0, 4)
[06:39:56] <xec> you misspelled .sleaze()
[06:40:01] <xec> ;D
[06:40:04] <Cork> :)
[06:41:00] <delboy1978uk> .sleaze() lol, what are the api docs for that haha?!
[06:41:16] <d0de> There can be things not in p elements, but it's acceptable to only filter stuff in p elements
[06:41:34] <xec> delboy1978uk: it's shorthand for .css("color", "hotpink")
[06:42:00] <delboy1978uk> lol
[06:42:38] <delboy1978uk> i thought it would have involved a politician json object
[06:44:30] <d0de> Should X.find('p').length and X.filter('p').length be the same? The latter is always 0
[06:44:59] <xec> no, filter looks at the items in the collection, but find looks at the descendants
[06:45:37] <xec> $("<div><p>test</p></div>") <-- use .find("p")
[06:45:42] <d0de> OK
[06:45:53] <xec> $("<div>my div</div><p>test</p>") <-- use .filter("p")
[06:46:06] <xec> well
[06:46:12] <d0de> Can I use slice with find()?
[06:47:14] <xec> yes, .find() returns a jquery collection just like $() or .filter() does
[06:49:00] <d0de> Oh, now I understand
[06:53:42] <angelZ123> hello, i have problem with image transitions, whats currently happening is when the image changes, first image disappears completely then another appears, and i want smooth transition from one image to another, this is the code i have: http://jsfiddle.net/JaM2C/14/
[07:06:01] <d0de> I want to strip out empty p tags. For stuff that was in the dom I could use $('parent p:empty').remove() but how can I do it for stuff where the parent is stored as an object?
[07:07:18] <BillCriswell> d0de: $parent.find('p:empty').remove()
[07:11:38] <d0de> BillCriswell, thank you, but I can't quite seem to get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/AwV2h/
[07:11:51] <d0de> for objects with no parent
[07:14:03] <BillCriswell> d0de: So you want the 1, 2, 3 ?
[07:14:19] <d0de> BillCriswell, yep
[07:15:18] <BillCriswell> d0de: This is where things get kind of weird. The filter('p:empty').remove() doesn't remove the reference to those elements in str.
[07:15:31] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/AwV2h/1/
[07:15:36] <seutje> just only append the ones u want
[07:17:36] <d0de> seutje, perfect, thanks very much. That's an elegant solution. I've never seen that filter syntax before :S
[07:18:01] <seutje> it's probably not all that optimal perfomance-wise
[07:18:07] <BillCriswell> d0de: It's important to realize why your way doesn't work though.
[07:18:12] <d0de> why doesn't filter('p:empty').remove() work?
[07:18:17] <seutje> but if ur not doing this tons of times every second, it won't matter
[07:18:30] <seutje> d0de: it doesn't remove it from the collection, it only removes it from the DOM
[07:18:36] <seutje> but it isn't in the DOM to begin with
[07:18:41] <seutje> so remove()ing it does... nothing
[07:18:55] <seutje> actually, it removed it from the parent element
[07:19:03] <seutje> removes
[07:19:24] <d0de> oh. So another way to solve the problem would be to wrap str in a parent and then use find() to do the same thing?
[07:20:54] <d0de> yeah, that works too
[07:22:29] <d0de> like http://jsfiddle.net/AwV2h/3/ (which seems a worse way to do it)
[07:22:48] <ianseyer> hey all - should I be having any issues when I try to replace the HTML of a former text-element with a text input field, wrapped in a form? Currently it displays the text field, but is unclickable (but CAN be selected via tab…).
[07:22:57] <ianseyer> on button click, so after the DOM is loaded
[07:23:22] <Cork> ianseyer: on mobile?
[07:23:55] <seutje> d0de: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a96d5bed58f2b30f97d6dd2f5691cd890f62b75f/src/manipulation.js#L358 heh, took me a second to find it
[07:24:20] <seutje> see 372 in particular
[07:24:29] <ianseyer> Cork: nope
[07:24:38] <d0de> seutje, oh wow, thanks very much!
[07:24:43] <Cork> ianseyer: then no it shouldn't be a problem
[07:25:10] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: I cheat and just use CSS for that functionaly.
[07:25:18] <Cork> d0de: use csp if you want to protect from js
[07:25:32] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: how so? making it "un"hidden?
[07:25:38] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/10/edit I think this is what you're going for, at least.
[07:25:44] <ianseyer> Cork: would you midn taking a look at this? https://gist.github.com/ianseyer/0f326fa580e7395cdf7d
[07:26:11] <Cork> ianseyer: String($(this).html()) <-- this is pointless
[07:26:16] <Cork> no need for the String()
[07:26:40] <ianseyer> Cork: yep, was trying things out because i am also having an issue with replacing it with the original HTML post-submit/cancel
[07:27:19] <Cork> ianseyer: context : document, <-- this will break the code inside the success function
[07:27:26] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: yes! exactly
[07:27:28] <ianseyer> Cork: really? okay
[07:27:33] <ianseyer> Cork: why?
[07:27:42] <Cork> ianseyer: $(this) === document
[07:27:46] <Cork> in success
[07:28:35] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: I think there's a lot of benefits to the approach I posted, but I'd have to see how well  screen reader handles it before I recommend it.
[07:29:03] <BillCriswell> I like that it puts the cursor where you clicked the most.
[07:29:11] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: yes, that is a VERY sleak solution
[07:29:40] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: would it be alright if I used it?
[07:30:06] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: $1 per field.
[07:30:11] <Cork> lol
[07:30:16] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: dogecoin?
[07:30:29] <ianseyer> ;)
[07:30:39] <BillCriswell> Very crypto.
[07:30:43] <ianseyer> such scam
[07:30:55] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: or rather, before that, I have a bit of a question: what is the <% syntax? can I just use my own template preprocessor?
[07:31:29] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: Yeah, how it's output doesn't matter.
[07:31:43] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: cool, just wanted to make sure i hadn't miss some HTML6 release or something.
[07:31:46] <BillCriswell> I only used that cause I was playing with some json data generator.
[07:32:47] <BillCriswell> The beautiful thing about it being all CSS is no need to initiate anything. Workings on dynamically loaded content, etc, etc
[07:33:25] <BillCriswell> My only concern would be the :focus pseudo selector. I am pretty sure it's well supported but not certain.
[07:33:31] <dan2k3k4> looking for a scrollintoview jquery plugin that works with jquery v2.1.0
[07:34:51] <ddssc> what's the best way to insert a javascript json object into a form at form submit?
[07:34:59] <BillCriswell> Cross-browser print style sheet testing today.
[07:35:11] <dan2k3k4> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/q42jaap/jquery-scrollintoview/master/jquery.scrollintoview.js
[07:35:27] <BillCriswell> Can you imagine something more terrifying?
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> Cross-browser print stylesheet in an email!
[07:36:45] <jParkton> gross
[07:38:41] <yashi> How do I get the deepest event target when writing a delegate like $(".contentbox").keydown(function (e){? I have an example of what I mean here: http://jsfiddle.net/df8yt/ I want to press CMD+CTRL+<right arrow> and always get the actual box where the key was pressed inside, and not always hte root level box.
[07:39:48] <BillCriswell> yashi: Think you want e.target ?
[07:39:55] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: thanks again man! code works like a beat
[07:39:57] <ianseyer> *beautf
[07:39:59] <ianseyer> fuck
[07:40:00] <ianseyer> *beaut
[07:40:05] <yashi> BillCriswell: I do use e.target, and it always gives me the top level box.
[07:40:14] <BillCriswell> yashi: then e.relatedTarget ?
[07:40:22] <BillCriswell> One of them damn things.
[07:40:25] <BillCriswell> Let me actually look.
[07:40:28] <d0de> This is probably a dumb question. How can I preload the elements in an object before I inject it into the dom?
[07:40:57] <yashi> Thanks
[07:41:28] <yashi> relatedTarget doesn't work
[07:42:49] <BillCriswell> yashi: You do just want .target: http://jsbin.com/loxos/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:44:50] <yashi> BillCriswell: It doesn't work though with keydown: http://jsbin.com/wewiwute/1/
[07:47:20] <BillCriswell> I thought I was typing in an input. What are you expecting target to be?
[07:47:53] <ianseyer> Cork: hey, so just out of curiosity: when i say var = $(this), does that resolve this to it's current value and then assign? or just keep it as a reference to whatever this is valued at when I call for that variable?
[07:47:56] <yashi> Well if you press CMD+CTRL+<right key> a new <div> should be created inside the div you were focused on.
[07:48:53] <yashi> BillCriswell: So you start with the root <div>, then you create a new one by CMD+CTRL+right_arrow, then type a bit in that child-box and press CMD+CTRL+right_arrow, the 2nd child box will then be inside the root box instead of inside the 1st child box.
[07:50:46] <AndChat74900> Hi all, i need some help. I want to know the english name for something i can't describe by words. If you visit the website data.weetmeer.nl and scroll down to the table and look at the most right column you will see the horizontal lines with small vertical lines and colored squares in it... Can you tell me what its called in english ?
[07:51:15] <BillCriswell> yashi: I'm guessing since the whole element is contenteditable it takes the keydown from the outermost element?
[07:52:11] <MikeD_> AndChat74900: that looks like a horizontal version of what statistics people call "box and whiskers" plot on a chart
[07:52:19] <yashi> BillCriswell: Exactly, though, when you actually enters text, it goes into the proper box. So how to get the target for what's on focus?
[07:52:42] <MikeD_> or maybe not, since it looks like a slider too - but doesn't slide, so idk.
[07:55:09] <BillCriswell> yashi: Not sure of a way around this that wouldn't require me to mess with it a lot haha
[07:55:11] <AndChat74900> Thank you mike i feel im a little bit closer:)
[07:55:46] <MikeD_> heh, and now i feel like i learned a bit of dutch:  laag = bad, hoog = good, zeer = very
[07:55:47] <yashi> BillCriswell: OK Thank you
[07:56:20] <BillCriswell> No problem. I'd probably reapproach it without nesting contenteditable.
[07:56:58] <yashi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5072164/keypress-event-on-nested-content-editable-jquery
[07:57:36] <BillCriswell> Yuck.
[08:00:42] <AndChat74900> Actually laag = low hoog = high if you learn something you better learn it right;)
[08:00:48] <yashi> "You can infer the element containing the caret from the browser's selection object anyway"
[08:01:32] <MikeD_> haha
[08:01:57] <MikeD_> the takeaway: high = good
[08:02:38] <decx> can confirm
[08:03:21] <BillCriswell> http://sassmeister.com/gist/9638030 I wish Sass could do this out of the box.
[08:03:23] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: hey bill, any idea how I would extract the newly typed value from the input? it seems to be "stuck" on the value it loaded with when i try and pull $input.attr('value')
[08:03:40] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: .val() would be the best bet.
[08:03:47] <ianseyer> so $input.val()
[08:03:58] <ianseyer> or $input.attr('value').val()?
[08:04:02] <ianseyer> (sorry, noobie)
[08:04:06] <BillCriswell> Just $input.val()
[08:04:42] <ianseyer> BillCriswell: that worked! thank ya
[08:05:54] <BillCriswell> ianseyer: No problem!
[08:07:15] <decx> so BillCriswell did you actually have yesterday off?
[08:11:46] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[08:12:06] <BillCriswell> Well, no one has said anything about it so I'm assuming yes.
[08:14:15] <antlong> looking for some help with a community developed game. ~15 people working on it, but we could use a hand with jquery functionality. www.multiverseminer.com - #multiverseminer
[08:15:07] <decx> cookieclicker-minecraft in space?
[08:15:44] <antlong> its not an incremental
[08:17:33] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking about going to an angular js workshop like thing tonight.
[08:18:20] <BillCriswell> I need a buddy system to go to these things.
[08:18:28] <antlong> where are you located?
[08:18:37] <BillCriswell> Philly
[08:18:38] <decx> do or do not, there is no thinking about it
[08:18:56] <antlong> I'm in nyc, i would go otherwise
[08:19:05] <antlong> i run 3 groups myself
[08:19:22] <BillCriswell> antlong: I go to one frequently and know a few people... but we mostly just drink.
[08:19:37] <antlong> yeah thats mostly been my experience with other peoples groups
[08:19:47] <antlong> if i wanted to drink i would do it with people i know, thats my outlook
[08:20:23] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but it's nice to drink with strangers with the same interest some times.
[08:20:27] <BillCriswell> I have no nerd friends.
[08:21:10] <decx> ah, a fellow daywalker
[08:22:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[08:24:11] <decx> i was visiting a friend, he said: i've got this awesome movie it's hilarious
[08:24:19] <decx> that movie? .... movie 43
[08:24:40] <BillCriswell> I have friends with no taste as well. It's ok.
[08:25:32] <decx> i tried to keep a straight face but when hugh jackman had balls on his chin and that was all there was about the sketch i nearly ceased the friendship because he laughed throughout ;D
[08:26:26] <BillCriswell> decx: Larry David apparently went to see it.
[08:26:46] <BillCriswell> and Emma Stone appears to be in it.
[08:26:56] <decx> who isnt in it
[08:27:43] <BillCriswell> Do you have a favorite comedy?
[08:28:11] <decx> changes as often as music
[08:28:31] <BillCriswell> I try to pin down my favorite song, but never my favorite artist.
[08:29:35] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what my favorite comedy would be...
[08:29:48] <BillCriswell> Clerks is up there.
[08:30:36] <decx> i'll have to say twilight breaking dawn part 2
[08:30:54] <jParkton> :|
[08:31:11] <decx> i laughed throughout
[08:31:13] <jParkton> Cloudy with a chance of meatballs
[08:31:19] <jParkton> much better
[08:31:25] <decx> and when the cgi vampire baby showed ... oh lol
[08:31:38] <jParkton> shoky are you alive yet?
[08:31:51] <BillCriswell> decx: How about Re-Animator when the cat comes back to life?
[08:31:57] <BillCriswell> That might be my favorite birth scene.
[08:32:07] <decx> ah. cat...
[08:32:13] <decx> christmas vacation gotta be it
[08:32:23] <decx> or whatever it was called in english
[08:33:11] <BillCriswell> decx: People who never see my last name often call me "Griswald"
[08:33:25] <decx> lol?
[08:33:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I guess I pronounce it weird.
[08:33:55] <jParkton> guys
[08:34:33] <jParkton> how do I refresh a element I append to the dom
[08:34:52] <decx> how do you refresh anything?
[08:34:54] <BillCriswell> jParkton: What do you mean by refresh?
[08:35:17] <jParkton> setTimeout() essentially
[08:35:27] <jParkton> do I just use setTimeout?
[08:35:43] <jParkton> but then I will append a million elements
[08:35:50] <jParkton> hrm
[08:36:03] <jParkton> shoky halp meh
[08:36:06] <decx> impossible to say without cotnext
[08:36:15] <jParkton> your a context!
[08:36:24] <decx> yes my a context
[08:36:50] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Are you running an ajax request every like... x seconds and getting some data for a div to update?
[08:36:56] <decx> $('.me','#a') ^^
[08:37:00] <jParkton> http://jsbin.com/yiwit/4
[08:37:18] <jParkton> its nubly
[08:37:30] <jParkton> and prob wrong
[08:38:02] <decx> why use jquery if you only use it to identify clock?
[08:38:40] <jParkton> because that is what im using
[08:38:41] <jParkton> lol
[08:38:44] <decx> didnt you have a working timeer yesterday?
[08:38:48] <jParkton> I could do it pure js
[08:38:53] <jParkton> yes
[08:39:05] <jParkton> I keep destroying it and making it again
[08:39:22] <jParkton> make it smaller, make it faster, make it infinite loop
[08:39:26] <jParkton> lol
[08:40:06] <jParkton> but how do I refresh that p?
[08:40:16] <jParkton> just setTimeout
[08:40:29] <BillCriswell> jParkton: http://css-tricks.com/examples/CSS3Clock/ this demo can help you with some ideas.
[08:41:23] <decx> what a misleading title
[08:41:34] <decx> hacker news title bait. css3 everything ;(
[08:41:37] <decx> ;)
[08:41:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[08:41:48] <jParkton> lol
[08:41:59] <d0de> ... getMonth() is 0 indexed? Seriously?
[08:41:59] <BillCriswell> Well, with CSS3 I think it would be pretty easy ( besides setting the current time ).
[08:42:03] <jParkton> that will make my clock
[08:42:07] <blue_warlock> hi guys
[08:42:08] <BillCriswell> d0de: Yes.
[08:42:16] <jParkton> but
[08:42:23] <decx> would only take like 50kb of keyframe rules BillCriswell ;)
[08:42:31] <jParkton> lol
[08:42:39] <d0de> isn't it odd that getMonth() is index 0 but getDate() is index 1?
[08:42:48] <decx> actually just 360deg over a period of time now that i think about it
[08:42:54] <jParkton> Is it?
[08:42:55] <BillCriswell> decx: It would just be three hands rotating at different speeds.
[08:43:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah, nothing crazy.
[08:43:12] <jParkton> rotations
[08:43:17] <jParkton> but that isnt what I need
[08:43:19] <jParkton> :P
[08:43:50] <BillCriswell> jParkton: What are you trying to end up with?
[08:44:10] <jParkton> a clock this time
[08:44:20] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:44:22] <jParkton> but im just manipulating the time and such right now
[08:44:35] <jParkton> later I will redo it
[08:44:49] <jParkton> just something newb to work on you know
[08:45:02] <BillCriswell> jParkton: So you have a date and you want to add some time?
[08:45:52] <jParkton> I want the seconds to display every second
[08:45:59] <jParkton> in that p elem I created
[08:46:10] <uskerine> hi, i am trying to setup a jquery click event for a button, but I notice that when i click on that button, it does -by default- a GET method posting all the form values
[08:46:17] <uskerine> it is a <button> element
[08:46:59] <jParkton> uskerine onclick="execute();" method="submit">
[08:46:59] <decx> jParkton you have to restructure the logic a bit
[08:47:12] <jParkton> makes sense decx
[08:47:14] <jParkton> lol
[08:47:23] <decx> jParkton http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6H7PG/
[08:47:48] <uskerine> why method="submit"?
[08:47:57] <uskerine> that's exactly what I want to avoid, that it submits anything
[08:48:27] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Add type="button" to the button... seems silly but it'll stop the form from submitting.
[08:49:15] <BillCriswell> WHy the default type for a button is submit and not button I never really understood. I feel like you should need to do <button type="submit"> like an input... but I dunno.
[08:49:21] <BillCriswell> Way late for that discussion!
[08:50:41] <uskerine> it works billcriswell, thanks a lot
[08:51:00] <uskerine> i'll never had guessed
[08:51:04] <uskerine> 'd*
[08:51:06] <uskerine> i'd*
[08:51:19] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:52:10] <jParkton> decx: that is way better
[08:52:14] <jParkton> thank you
[08:52:50] <angelZ123> hello, i have problem with image transitions, whats currently happening is when the image changes, first image disappears completely then another appears, and i want smooth transition from one image to another, this is the code i have: http://jsfiddle.net/JaM2C/14/
[08:53:35] <BillCriswell> jParkton: A useful trick for getting 0 padded numbers would be ("0" +  3).slice(-2); instead of testing if it's less than 10 and all of that.
[08:54:32] <decx> angelZ123 you'll have to clone every .image container hidden with the new bgimage, fade that copy in. change the originals bg to the new one and then remove the clone. after that start over again
[08:55:40] <decx> it all comes down to having 2 overlaying .image containers
[08:55:50] <angelZ123> can i pm?
[08:55:53] <decx> no
[08:56:14] <decx> pm is consulting and i have to charge for that :D
[08:56:29] <angelZ123> ok
[08:56:45] <decx> but that's the gist of it
[08:57:14] <BillCriswell> angelZ123: It sounds like you're looking for a slideshow. You may be better off just Googling for that.
[08:57:39] <BillCriswell> UNless you're doing this to understand more. In which case, keep at it!
[08:57:49] <decx> with separate fixed background divs? doubt it
[08:58:02] <angelZ123> i tryed to google bill but i didnt find anything that suits me
[08:58:04] <BillCriswell> ah missed that.
[08:58:19] <angelZ123> i mean i tryed a lot of different ways but this is the one i find best for what i need
[08:58:34] <angelZ123> i just have to make that transition :)
[08:58:36] <decx> you can have 2 overlaying .image containers and alternate between them
[08:59:08] <decx> add the new one to the one on top and fade that in, then add the new one to the lower .image and fade the top one out
[08:59:14] <decx> and alternate between these states
[08:59:21] <angelZ123> okay so i just make 2 different scripts where one fades in when other fades out in same time?
[08:59:29] <decx> no just one fades
[08:59:36] <decx> mom
[08:59:46] <angelZ123> aha
[08:59:48] <CheshireCat_> to find an element in the same div as the one i'm on, do i do $(this).parent().find('#id') ?
[09:00:25] <angelZ123> is it same thing if i use 5 backgrounds?
[09:00:37] <CheshireCat_> its a sibling, the next element
[09:00:47] <decx> i don'T think you can change the opacity of multiple backgrounds
[09:01:19] <BillCriswell> CheshireCat_: $(this).next() I think you're after? If you need an element with a specific id though why not just $('#id') ?
[09:01:34] <angelZ123> what if i make 5 functions for each background and than just fix the timing so it looks like its sliding?
[09:01:35] <CheshireCat_> oh yeah
[09:01:39] <CheshireCat_> its a class that i need
[09:01:43] <CheshireCat_> .class sorry
[09:02:21] <CheshireCat_> hmm next seems to work!
[09:02:34] <BillCriswell> CheshireCat_: Ok. well .next() would get you the element after the current one.
[09:02:36] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[09:02:58] <CheshireCat_> its there a different situation where next gets the next element in a collection?
[09:03:08] <CheshireCat_> like if you had a selector that find a bunch of items?
[09:03:45] <BillCriswell> .next() on a collection would return the first element in the collections next element ( I think ).
[09:04:03] <CheshireCat_> gotcha
[09:04:29] <BillCriswell> Huh, weird. It grabbed them all.
[09:04:39] <BillCriswell> Oh wait no it didn't.
[09:04:49] <BillCriswell> It got the next of all the elements.
[09:04:50] <CheshireCat_> are you doing like a js fiddle
[09:05:27] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qesanavi/1/edit?html,js,output yes
[09:05:59] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: like most methods for a single element called on an object it just uses the first element in the collection
[09:06:03] <decx> angelZ123 i have to afk for a while. but yeah. overlay divs, and alternate
[09:06:05] <doug_> angelZ123: does this solve your issue: http://jsfiddle.net/JaM2C/15/
[09:06:08] <arschmitz> called on a collection i mean
[09:06:27] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: It didn't seem to do that for the fiddle I made: http://jsbin.com/qesanavi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:06:39] <decx> that's not a fiddle
[09:06:42] <decx> that's a spacestation
[09:06:47] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:07:33] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: That's what I expected to happen as well.
[09:07:51] <angelZ123> doug_ no, other background must be fully visible until other one lays over it
[09:07:56] <blue_warlock> guys
[09:07:58] <blue_warlock> hello
[09:08:10] <BillCriswell> I would think: $('li').next().css('color', 'blue'); would just make the second list item blue.
[09:08:32] <angelZ123> decx thank you. i will try something i dont know maybe i work something out :)
[09:08:33] <BillCriswell> Hi.
[09:09:12] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/qesanavi/2/edit
[09:10:57] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: If instead of getting the attribute you use .css() to set something shouldn't it just apply to "bar" though? http://jsbin.com/qesanavi/3/edit
[09:12:19] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: interesting your right it creates a new collection that is the next of each one
[09:14:09] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: Yeah thought that seemed a little weird.
[09:15:21] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: "Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .next() method allows us to search through the immediately following sibling of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements."
[09:15:33] <arschmitz> first line in the api http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:17:47] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: I wasn't doubting it was behaving right haha, just not what I was expecting.
[09:18:07] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: oh i know was just pointing out we were both wrong to assume such
[09:18:20] <arschmitz> and that it could not be better documented lol
[09:19:40] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: There's a few times I don't look at the docs close enough and miss something important. I would have definitely missed that.
[09:19:57] <BillCriswell> shoky is usually there to say "3rd paragraph down" or something haha
[09:35:10] <uskerine> can i store sort kind of "global/last value" value in javascript? I have a data filed (data-id) that comes from a datatable, I use that value in a JQuery function but later there is a CANCEL button and I would like to reuse that 'data-id' value again. Any tip? Thanks
[09:36:20] <duch_kazatel> you can do that, sure, but avoid using global scope for it.
[09:36:49] <uskerine> can you point for me the right direction to follow?
[09:37:25] <uskerine> the datatable has a list of items, each one with different id, when i click on a link, it populates a form, the user edits the form and then a modal window appear to allow him accept or cancel
[09:37:38] <duch_kazatel> copy your data to an object on pageload and update that object when you successfully "accept"
[09:37:40] <uskerine> if he/she cancels, i would like to reload everything with the last value (data-id)
[09:38:06] <duch_kazatel> OR don't edit the .data()
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> *don't edit it until they've hit "accept"
[09:38:22] <kosepusen> i am getting a datepicker undefined error, even though I include jquery-ui in my page.... http://development.jenniferstrand.com/solberg/bestill-service/
[09:38:55] <uskerine> but what i have is only form fields that have to be repopulated again
[09:39:55] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't matter - don't commit that change to the .data('id') until they've hit accept.
[09:40:25] <uskerine> mmm you are assuming that there is a hidden field in the form with the id, right?
[09:40:29] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:40:32] <BillCriswell> kosepusen: Did you include it before jQuery?
[09:40:48] <kosepusen> include jquery-ui BEFORE jquery ?
[09:41:09] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying you should track changes and only commit those changes after they've hit accept.
[09:41:09] <BillCriswell> kosepusen: That's not right, but some people do it.
[09:41:34] <BillCriswell> kosepusen: I'm trying to make sure you didn't do that.
[09:41:51] <uskerine> this is my JQuery method: http://pastebin.com/5v6kzNhv, it uses data-id from a link in #customerListTable
[09:41:56] <kosepusen> no, i load jquery, then jquery-ui, then my script calling datepicker
[09:42:09] <duch_kazatel> kosepusen any reason you're using jquery 1.7.2?
[09:42:20] <uskerine> in a different button, i would like to reload the form, like it is done in the customerListTable method, but I no longer have access to $(this).data('id');
[09:42:31] <kosepusen> it's what came with the system, is that the issue ?
[09:42:37] <BillCriswell> kosepusen: Where should you click to get the datepicker error?
[09:42:45] <uskerine> I am not following what you suggest to do duch_kazatel :(
[09:42:52] <BillCriswell> All I'm seeing is a shitload of 404 errors form image requests.
[09:42:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell the error happens on pageload.
[09:42:53] <kosepusen> you can see the error on page load
[09:43:14] <BillCriswell> I see "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'noWeekends' of undefined" then the 404s.
[09:43:14] <kosepusen> yes, it's a test server, i didn't load all the images on this server
[09:43:30] <duch_kazatel> uskerine this is where using .data() starts to fall apart - you need to have another object to store changes in.
[09:43:53] <duch_kazatel> that object should be in a parent scope of everything else.  put your changes in there, then your accept function puts those changes in the right places.
[09:43:56] <kosepusen> firebug gives me TypeError: $.datepicker is undefined
[09:44:17] <BillCriswell> Not seeing that error here.
[09:44:37] <duch_kazatel> you're probably using chrome, BillCriswell :)
[09:44:56] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:45:25] <duch_kazatel> kosepusen only include jquery once.
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> I'm seeing two includes right now.
[09:45:38] <kosepusen> yea, i just noticed that
[09:45:45] <kosepusen> the system loads one, have to figure out how to kill it
[09:49:03] <uskerine> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:52:47] <thaifood> hi
[09:54:34] <thaifood> how can i access the value in "challenge" and "challenge_ans" for each of these 3 objects?  http://laravel.io/bin/29JBl
[09:55:54] <BillCriswell> thaifood: What do you have so far?
[09:56:21] <thaifood> this returns the key value and [object Object] $.each(uc, function(key, value) { console.log(key + " | " + value); });
[09:56:42] <thaifood> hi BillCriswell nice to see you
[09:57:31] <BillCriswell> Nice to see you too. Ok, so `value` would be each object. You'd want to use value.propertyName to get to what you want.
[09:58:31] <BillCriswell> Since challenge_ans is in the pivot object you would need value.pivot.propertyName
[09:58:37] <thaifood> ahhh
[09:58:41] <thaifood> that makes sense
[09:58:57] <thaifood> that worked great.  thanks so much
[09:59:05] <thaifood> console.log(key + " | " + value.challenge+ " | " + value.pivot.challenge_ans);
[09:59:11] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[09:59:19] <thaifood> woot
[10:32:29] <jost> +-
[10:32:45] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what have you started over in ##javascript?
[10:32:58] <duch_kazatel> you've invoked the pedantic beasts.
[10:33:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I can't be the only one over there who thinks that jQuery is javascript.
[10:33:56] <duch_kazatel> you're the only one willing to say it
[10:34:03] <Uhkis> :-)
[10:34:21] <duch_kazatel> there's a lot of spite over there about jq
[10:34:42] <Uhkis> they dont like jq?
[10:35:01] <duch_kazatel> largely, no.
[10:35:12] <duch_kazatel> many feel it's entirely unnecessary, bloated, slow.
[10:35:13] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:35:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: There's some very intelligent people over there. I don't get how they can argue that jQuery isn't javascript.
[10:35:38] <Uhkis> sounds like me about 6 years ago
[10:36:12] <BillCriswell> "Boys are male but male aren't boys" What?
[10:36:30] <duch_kazatel> i think it's largely because they want to feel superior.
[10:36:36] <duch_kazatel> and their last experience with jquery was years ago,
[10:36:56] <BillCriswell> Haha I really don't get it.
[10:37:12] <duch_kazatel> all dogs are mammals but not all mammals are dogs.
[10:37:25] <duch_kazatel> Sorella has a huge teardown about the API and how THEY would have built it, but refuse to offer any actual assistance to make jQuery any better.
[10:37:49] <duch_kazatel> like plenty of other folks, they'd rather just detract and tear people down.  Meanwhile, I'm over here getting shit done.
[10:37:52] <duch_kazatel> it's a funny thing.
[10:38:05] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: If there was no mammels there would be no dogs.
[10:38:14] <duch_kazatel> exactly :)
[10:38:19] <duch_kazatel> dogs are mammals.
[10:38:32] <duch_kazatel> jquery IS javascript.  spring IS java
[10:38:33] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:39:25] <duch_kazatel> it's just like the semicolon thing imo.
[10:39:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I never spoke with Sorella about jQuery, but with lots of other things s/he's brought up some really interesting points. A lot of it was over my head to be honest haha.
[10:39:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What's that?
[10:40:03] <duch_kazatel> i think it really boils down to a matter of preference.
[10:40:26] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Absolutely, but nothing should lead you to argue against a logical statement.
[10:40:41] <duch_kazatel> i prefer to use semicolons - it makes things easier to read for me (and many others).  some folks over there argue that is wrong - that not using semicolons is objectively better
[10:40:45] <BillCriswell> Unless it's for fun, of course.
[10:41:04] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, ok. I don't even bother myself with issues that small.
[10:41:17] <BillCriswell> The semicolons seem safer long and short of it.
[10:41:45] <duch_kazatel> Sorella would say you're wrong :)  and yeah, she has some fantastic points, but tends to get worked up over things like for loops.
[10:42:32] <BillCriswell> Haha interesting.
[10:42:43] <BillCriswell> Well,just like everything else. Take everything in and filter out what's useful.
[10:42:48] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[10:42:56] <BillCriswell> Or filter... in.
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> filter around.
[10:58:37] <yashi> BillCriswell: It worked in the end with document.getSelection().anchorNode.parentNode instead of e.target
[11:08:34] <BillCriswell> yashi: Man, that must have been a fun one to figure out.
[11:09:07] <yashi> BillCriswell: Just thankful for stackch overflow...
[11:09:47] <BillCriswell> yashi: It is insanely useful.
[11:09:49] <yashi> Now I gotta figure out how to add the divs in the position of the caret and not just at the end of the focused div
[11:10:25] <BillCriswell> yashi: What is your end goal for that? Not sure I was following.
[11:11:18] <antlong> have a really small side gig if anyone is interested. need a combat system built up for a web based game.
[11:15:22] <BillCriswell> Damn, new firefox looking a lot like Chrome.
[11:15:30] <antlong> vom
[11:15:31] <BillCriswell> May have been like this for a while but I rarely open it haha.
[11:24:30] <yashi> BillCriswell: I wanna create a structure math notebook using boxes of theorem/proof/definition and mathquill
[11:24:51] <decx> when i have a loop which generates random numbers between 0 and 40, how do i get a strong distribution in the low range. so that i have a lot of elements between 1 and 10 and only outliers between 10 and 40
[11:25:30] <decx> i could write something overly specific but maybe there's something for it
[11:25:32] <decx> ^^
[11:25:46] <BillCriswell> decx: Can you change 40 to 10 for like 3/4 of the loop?
[11:26:02] <decx> that's what it would do
[11:26:05] <decx> something like it
[11:26:37] <BillCriswell> decx: That's what I'd do I guess... I am not a math man as you know.
[11:26:52] <BillCriswell> yashi: Ah, sounds over my head.
[11:27:14] <Ptsnanan> http://jsfiddle.net/n3NTc/
[11:27:42] <Ptsnanan> Why I can't to do wroks this script

[11:29:33] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: Do console.log(e) and see if it's a string of an object... assuming it's a string.
[11:29:46] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: Also, I'd name it something better than e. It's kind of a confusing name.
[11:31:33] * Velveeta scratches himself.
[11:32:45] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: My beard has been itching.
[11:40:04] <shoky> oh my, yashi is here
[11:44:18] <jParkton> is this how I target class clock, create element p class="hourHand" ? $('.clock').add( '<p>', { class:hourHand } );
[11:45:11] <BillCriswell> jParkton: $('.clock') targets that class. Not sure what you're trying to do with add() there, though.
[11:48:33] <jParkton> add element p
[11:48:40] <jParkton> with a class of hourHand
[11:49:18] <BillCriswell> jParkton: I think you're trying to .append(), .add() would be uses for selecting $('.clcokc').add('.and-something-else');
[11:49:57] <shoky> jParkton:  var p = $('<p>', {"class":"hourHand"});   $('.clock').append(p);   (or:  p.appendTo('.clock') )
[11:50:09] <Ptsnanan> BillCriswell : men if in the encode package come an array how can I for show all the value with jquery?
[11:50:15] <jParkton> ohh
[11:50:24] <shoky> you can only pass an initializer object like that when using $() to create a new element
[11:50:32] <jParkton> ok
[11:50:35] <antlong> anyone interested in helping out with a browser based game.
[11:50:38] <jParkton> close though lol
[11:50:47] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: You'd have to loop through it.
[11:50:50] <jParkton> me once I become worth a poop
[11:50:52] <jParkton> lol
[11:51:19] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: I think that's what you're trying to do. HArd time following what you're asking, though.
[11:51:47] <Ptsnanan> yes I would like to do a loop with jquery
[11:52:10] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: With that array you can just use a regular for() loop. You can no benefit from using jQuery here.
[11:52:42] <Ptsnanan> I have seen is with each()
[11:52:53] <Ptsnanan> But I don't know how get it!
[11:52:57] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: Yes, that can also work. I t might be overkill.
[11:53:11] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: $.each( array, function( itemInArray ) { ... });
[11:53:32] <Ptsnanan> Ok men, I will try
[11:53:36] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: Blah, function ( index, itemInArray )
[11:53:36] <Ptsnanan> Thank you
[11:53:40] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: No problem.
[11:53:44] <BillCriswell> I also mess up .each.
[11:54:32] <systemfault> Yeah… that's the stupid jQuery "I LOVE to modify 'this' without reason" pattern.
[11:55:06] <systemfault> The reason why "index" is the first arg in callbacks is that "this" is expected to be used to get the element.
[11:55:16] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Ah.
[11:55:25] <BillCriswell> systemfault: No matter what, I'll fuck up argument order.
[11:55:27] <BillCriswell> guaranteed.
[11:55:38] <systemfault> :)
[11:56:02] <Ptsnanan> http://jsfiddle.net/5L4rp/
[11:56:04] <Ptsnanan> Like this?
[11:56:09] <Ptsnanan> Because doesn't works
[11:56:16] <MikeD_> i like that it's each( idx, el ) and map( el, idx)
[11:56:20] <Ptsnanan> and not getting nothing in the console
[11:56:45] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: You'd want function(index, val) not function(val)
[11:56:47] <systemfault> MikeD_: Do you have a reason?
[11:57:05] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: And there's nothing in the console because you didn't do console.log(e);
[11:57:11] <MikeD_> want me to make one up or is "idk" a good enough answer?
[11:57:13] <systemfault> MikeD_: In a "each" function, you rarely need to access the index… you always need the value
[11:57:23] <systemfault> Ah… so no technical merits.
[11:57:24] <systemfault> Ok.
[11:58:09] <MikeD_> i could play devils advocate for either ordering... but I'd make them consistent
[11:58:41] <BillCriswell> Devi's advocate gets me into so much trouble.
[11:58:45] <BillCriswell> Devil's*
[11:59:58] <Ptsnanan> BillCriswell : $.each(e['file'], function(index, val){ $(".contFiledb").html(inde + val); });
[12:00:04] <Ptsnanan> Now  neither doesn't nothing
[12:00:38] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: I have no idea what e['file'] is or anything so without those working I can't really help.
[12:01:27] <Ptsnanan> Bring the name of several files
[12:01:48] <Ptsnanan> and is working because with firebug I see the package content
[12:02:08] <MikeD_> Ptsnanan: for sanity's sake, name that second parameter "el" or "elem" or "theThing" so you don't confuse it's use with .val()
[12:03:05] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: http://jsbin.com/nuqosicu/1/edit?js,output here is a simple $.each dmeo.
[12:10:20] <Ptsnanan> http://pastebin.com/hnARPtXG
[12:10:37] <Ptsnanan> I put this but doesn't show me the array
[12:10:59] <Ptsnanan> If Instead array I put a simple "Something", works perfect, the problem is calling the array
[12:15:33] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: Log the result of the request.
[12:15:48] <BillCriswell> Also, are you posting data or just trying to get some? Should probably be using .get()
[12:16:27] <BillCriswell> Ptsnanan: http://jsbin.com/nuqosicu/2/edit?js,output this is how is basically works.
[12:19:32] <Ptsnanan> BillCriswell : is very weird, if I simply alert(obj); show me 8 times the numbers, but if I do this :: $(".contFiledb").html('<li>'+el+'</li>'); show me only the number 8
[12:19:55] <Ptsnanan> with console.log(obj) as well show me the 8 numbers in the console
[12:21:18] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan right - you're overwriting that HTML every time, so you onle see one result.
[12:21:21] <duch_kazatel> you want .append()
[12:21:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Glad you followed that I was lost.
[12:21:59] <duch_kazatel> i think i followed it hahaha
[12:22:09] <Ptsnanan> yes
[12:22:11] <Ptsnanan> this works
[12:22:20] <duch_kazatel> i saw "i want this to happen 8 times, but when I do $(".contFiledb").html('<li>'+el+'</li>'); it happens once.
[12:23:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah looking at it now it seems obvious.
[12:24:05] <duch_kazatel> i am so tired.  need to figure out lunch.
[12:24:06] <Ptsnanan> Now Works perfectly
[12:24:10] <Ptsnanan> Thanks you Guys-!!
[12:24:15] <Ptsnanan> Thank*
[12:24:46] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:24:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I had a bag of Fritos for lunch.
[12:25:01] <duch_kazatel> high rolla
[12:25:08] <BillCriswell> Pretty happy with that choice.
[12:25:54] <duch_kazatel> i get my bocce / petanque set today
[12:25:58] <duch_kazatel> this is a good thing.
[12:26:09] <BillCriswell> What's the second thing?
[12:26:14] <BillCriswell> Familiar with bocce.
[12:26:23] <BillCriswell> Is that the ball you throw the boccee balls to?
[12:26:32] <duch_kazatel> that's the pallino/jack
[12:26:33] <BillCriswell> Is that the smaller ball*
[12:26:36] <BillCriswell> Ah, ok.
[12:26:42] <BillCriswell> No idea what the petanque is then.
[12:26:51] <duch_kazatel> petanque is basically french bocce.  they use smaller, metal balls and you throw while standing still.
[12:27:10] <duch_kazatel> in bocce you can shoot from anywhere behind the foul line.
[12:27:12] <BillCriswell> I thought you were supposed to stand still in bocce as well?
[12:27:16] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:27:16] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[12:27:24] <BillCriswell> That's interesting.
[12:27:30] <duch_kazatel> in fact you can cross the foul line in bocce as long as the ball leaves your hand first.
[12:27:48] <duch_kazatel> hell your foot can be ON the foul line.
[12:28:26] <BillCriswell> Is it the same spot each turn or for the whole game?
[12:28:38] <duch_kazatel> for petanque, the whole frame.
[12:29:01] <BillCriswell> frame equals turn?
[12:29:06] <duch_kazatel> frame is a round.
[12:29:17] <duch_kazatel> like in bowling -
[12:29:28] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[12:29:33] <BillCriswell> I hate bowling.
[12:29:46] <BillCriswell> Easily my least favorite thing in the world.
[12:29:48] <duch_kazatel> bocce is one of the predecessors to bowling.
[12:29:59] <BillCriswell> You know what they always play at bowling alleys? Journey. Double whammy.
[12:30:05] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[12:30:08] <duch_kazatel> that's right you hate journey.
[12:31:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Well, bocce is a lot more fun. I think I'd appreciate bowling more if the pins were set up randomly going down the lane instead of in the same spot every single time.
[12:31:23] <duch_kazatel> that's fair.
[12:31:34] <BillCriswell> Not enough variables to it.
[12:31:43] <jimi_> How should I tackle this? I want all ajax requests that are executed through jquery to have some common call back on timeout. I don't want to go through all the code to find it. Can I over-ride it some where?
[12:32:24] <BillCriswell> A guy with the same bowl hitting the same pins laid out the same way on the same lane. The only thing that really changes is the slickness of the lane.
[12:32:43] <BillCriswell> jimi_: $.ajaxSetup maybe?
[12:32:58] <BillCriswell> jimi_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ should be something in there for you.
[12:33:12] <BillCriswell> A guy with the same ball*
[12:33:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that makes a lot of sense actually.  i just like that bocce et al are really laid back and, for the cost of going to the bowling alley twice, I can play at home.
[12:33:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes. Bocce is a great game. Especially if you play on a surface that isn't perfectly flat.
[12:34:23] <duch_kazatel> yeah i've heard that makes it even better.
[12:34:40] <BillCriswell> but even if it was perfectly flat you'd have to work around the balls being in the way in different situations.
[12:34:45] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:34:50] <duch_kazatel> and you can move the pallino
[12:34:53] <duch_kazatel> that makes me a happy man.
[12:35:02] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Very good point.
[12:35:12] <duch_kazatel> a lot of strategy imo.
[12:35:48] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:36:00] <BillCriswell> Unlike bowling.
[12:36:04] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[12:37:30] <BillCriswell> The only time bowling is remotely interesting is if you need to pick up a weird spare.
[12:42:02] <jimi_> BillCriswell, looking at it, seeing if I can override the on timeout but looks like its in here
[12:44:00] <BillCriswell> jimi_: I am not super familiar with ajax to be honest. But if I was trying to difure this out I might look into http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/ and see if that 4th argument mentions something about a timeout?
[12:44:46] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ check out global ajax events, as well.
[12:45:03] <jimi_> yep, im looking at them
[12:45:23] <jimi_> Actually , let me tell you the issue I am trying to solve.
[12:45:29] <duch_kazatel> the third argument passed to the error handler is the error message.
[12:45:46] <jimi_> We have a website, and also a mobile version of the site as well, that is wrapped as an IPA, but it's just a frame to the mobile version.
[12:46:03] <jimi_> People complain that when they have low connectivity or spoty connectivity the app is really slow and sucks
[12:47:03] <jimi_> I can cache some things on the device, like images, and a little bit of css, but much of it depends on dynamic content / interactions. So, I was thinking about putting in timeouts, that would let them know the issue they are having is due to connectivity, not the app itself.
[12:47:55] <BillCriswell> jimi_: $(document).ajaxError(function(event, xhr, settings, error){}); and error might mention something about a timeout?
[12:47:59] <duch_kazatel> you should probably refactor some of your ajax code, as well.
[12:48:54] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch
[12:49:02] <BillCriswell> It's like the internet is a bonus features building a website nowadays.
[12:49:50] <jimi_> BillCriswell, ha
[12:51:10] <BillCriswell> Our jobs got a lot harder over the past few years. It is awesome and sucks at the same time.
[12:52:57] <jimi_> BillCriswell, this looks perfect, just gonna throw this into global : http://pastie.org/private/unzfbcliupvlnmzivm9uag
[12:54:23] <BillCriswell> jimi_: Hope it works out!
[12:54:36] <bberry> interesting question here... http://jsfiddle.net/z7MS4/2/ The 4th argument of my .then callback function is the return value of the prior function called. Read the comments, the question is better explained.  Do i have to do it the 2nd way?
[12:59:04] <ngharo> bberry: just because a function has a parameter doesn't mean it has to be called with it
[13:00:20] <bberry> yeah. its an optional parameter. and it should be undefined. But the .then is filling 4th parameter with the return value of the prior ajax call.
[13:03:11] <bberry> basically, arguments[3] will always be the return value of the prior .then function.
[13:03:25] <bberry> (unless its defined in the .bind)
[13:03:45] <bberry> in that case, arguments[4] is the return value of the prior .then function
[13:03:50] <ngharo> you could call JSONpost with an anonymous function so parameters don't get clobbered i guess
[13:04:03] <ngharo> else just do some validation on your 4th parameter
[13:04:29] <bberry> ngharo yeah. meh. oh well! :P
[13:10:20] <pearo> Hm, I'm trying fadeIn elements one at a time in a for loop but not sure how to add a delay between the elements. http://jsfiddle.net/A83cA/ Any advice here?
[13:11:33] <BillCriswell> pearo: http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/ this article was a good read for me when I was trying to accomplish that.
[13:15:24] <pearo> BillCriswell I really need to learn and read more. I can barely understand most of the solutions in that article except for the first one ;) i'll give it a try though
[13:22:10] <BillCriswell> pearo: It wasn't the easiest thing to grasp when I tried to accomplish it for the first time either.
[13:22:25] <BillCriswell> pearo: You relly just have to mess arounf with it till it makes sense to you
[13:26:10] <jParkton> http://jsbin.com/yiwit/6 why is my arms() not working like I expect it to
[13:26:27] <jParkton> I do not see a p element inthe dom and I see no errors in console
[13:27:10] <__joshua___> two 404s?
[13:28:24] <__joshua___> also, what do you think this does: "(function arms() {var mHand = this.mHand; $('.clock').append(mHand);})();"
[13:28:26] <BillCriswell> jParkton: console.log(this)
[13:28:50] <jParkton> so how do I call that var inside the function?
[13:28:54] <jParkton> just mHand?
[13:30:11] <jParkton> nope
[13:30:15] <jParkton> and fail
[13:30:17] <jParkton> :)
[13:30:31] <BillCriswell> jParkton: The variables you set in clock can only be accessed in clock with the way you're writing them.
[13:30:45] <jParkton> oh
[13:30:52] <jParkton> hrm
[13:30:54] <__joshua___> jParkton: you should make a jsfiddle if you need some help
[13:31:00] <jParkton> so back to the drawing board
[13:31:12] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Yes.
[13:31:14] <jParkton> oh jsbin is a pain?
[13:31:15] <shoky> also appending things to a <canvas> won't do much for you
[13:33:16] <jParkton> :( sad
[13:34:56] <jParkton> omg
[13:35:15] <jParkton> http://jsfiddle.net/jparkton/X4dv6/2/
[13:35:18] <jParkton> better?
[13:35:32] <jParkton> At least the arm is there now!! \0/
[13:36:20] <jParkton> so if I want to make those vars global I need to do this.var and clock(var)?
[13:36:28] <jParkton> or that is also wrong
[13:36:43] <jParkton> this.var inside clock
[13:37:11] <shoky> why make the clcok() function create those elements
[13:37:26] <shoky> they have nothing to do with the clock() function
[13:37:39] <__joshua___> also, how are you doing to do it with DOM elements?
[13:38:05] <jParkton> no they dont, but I mean some var accessed outside
[13:38:16] <jParkton> I dunno
[13:38:25] <jParkton> im learning by failing
[13:38:26] <jParkton> :)
[13:38:36] <__joshua___> try using canvas, its easiest way to do this
[13:39:29] <duch_lunch> jParkton you might want to read about scope and learn more.
[13:39:59] <jParkton> if I use canvas my arm doesnt show up
[13:40:35] <BillCriswell> jParkton: You have to draw on canvas, not just add elements.
[13:40:44] <jParkton> I cant draw
[13:40:46] <jParkton> lol
[13:44:18] <ophi491> why does it seem like styling is the hardest part of using jquery/js with html
[13:44:41] <duch_kazatel> usually means you need to learn CSS :)
[13:45:02] <ophi491> i think so
[13:45:47] <ophi491> i had to take a break from my extension for a week my brain was on fire
[13:45:58] <ophi491> but thank you from before you helped me finish all the funcitonality :)
[13:46:13] <duch_kazatel> rad
[13:48:00] <BillCriswell> I need to get involved with an open source project.
[13:48:07] <antlong> BillCriswell :D :D :D
[13:48:10] <antlong> i have one for youuuuu
[13:48:33] <BillCriswell> antlong: Haha I have no interest in a game though.
[13:48:38] <antlong> boo
[13:48:43] <BillCriswell> I agree!
[13:49:02] <duch_kazatel> i do at some point too.
[13:49:31] <BillCriswell> http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ I wish I knew about this months ago.
[13:49:43] <BillCriswell> Still useful ot me, but I think I would have picked things up quicker.
[13:50:24] <pearo> BillCriswell It still fades in all at once- what's the best way to add a delay between each element fading in? http://jsfiddle.net/n9anj/
[13:50:57] <BillCriswell> pearo: Can you spare some HTML/CSS?
[13:51:05] <antlong> i have one piece that really needs to get done
[13:51:08] <antlong> its very simple JS
[13:51:38] <BillCriswell> pearo: Alos, you probably want to init it with showNextElement($('.element_select li').eq(0));
[13:51:57] <BillCriswell> You're only supposed to pass one element to that.
[13:52:46] <duch_kazatel> antlong if it's simple then why not do it yourself?
[13:53:13] <antlong> because i don't do javascript dood
[13:53:15] <antlong> if i did i would
[13:53:31] <pearo> BillCriswell ah :) that worked.
[13:53:39] <duch_kazatel> not to be a jerk, but you're basically saying it'
[13:53:48] <duch_kazatel> *it's going to be simple without being qualified to make that assesment ;)
[13:54:35] <BillCriswell> pearo: Sweet.
[13:54:44] <pearo> BillCriswell yeah thanks!
[13:54:55] <BillCriswell> pearo: Does it make sense  a little more now?
[13:56:22] <pearo> BillCriswell It does. It makes sense now that I had to only call one element otherwise I'd be calling all 3 at once
[13:56:47] <BillCriswell> Right right.
[14:03:40] <antlong> if i could write it in python in 3-4 minutes
[14:03:49] <antlong> i assume, rightfully, that it should be a few mins work in javascript
[14:04:15] <wdna> Hay, I have some strange issue, http://pastebin.com/gXYcBgng , find returns 0 input elements (or any others) although they are in dom, I can get them all via $(). what am I missing here? plz help =]
[14:05:27] <duch_kazatel> wdna could you share your markup as well?
[14:06:05] <wdna> duch_kazatel, ya one min
[14:06:10] <shoky> do you actually see length: 0
[14:09:29] <wdna> shoky, ya
[14:09:36] <wdna> duch_kazatel, http://pastebin.com/N3LLJ32v
[14:10:13] <wdna> i'm doing this all the time, not really new to jQuery, but something I don't understand going on here can find what
[14:10:24] <wdna> can't*
[14:11:45] <shoky> jsfiddle time
[14:12:57] <wdna> it tried different versions of jQuery, now it's jquery-1.11.1 (last)
[14:13:31] <BillCriswell> Later everyoneeeeeee
[14:13:40] <pearo> How do I set the queue to false in this example? http://jsfiddle.net/n9anj/1/ I'm trying to make it so that each element gradually appear but it looks choppy right now
[14:15:39] <shoky> there's no queueing going on there
[14:16:05] <pearo> shoky yeah I'm not sure how to set it. Do you mean that it's not possible or just that I'm missing it?
[14:16:19] <shoky> what's not possible? donno what you wanna do
[14:17:31] <antlong> has anyone used gameQuery
[14:18:06] <pearo> shoky right now each element is triggered only after the previous element reaches opacity =1. I'm trying to make it so that the next element will fade in while previous element opacity is at 0.5 so the transitions will feel smoother
[14:19:05] <pearo> normally, when I set the queue to false, it works- but don't know how to add it to my code while calling a function
[14:20:24] <wdna> duch_kazatel, I found the issue dude. someone plased the whole modal div inside <tbody> :/
[14:20:52] <pearo> this is basically what I normally do except now only the first element shows http://jsfiddle.net/n9anj/2/
[14:20:56] <shoky> pearo: the queue is irrelevant here as you're animating 3 separate elements
[14:21:18] <shoky> pearo: no one's stopping you from starting an animation whenever you want.  http://jsfiddle.net/n9anj/4/
[14:24:00] <shoky> pearo: and btw your 2nd fiddle doesn't work because the callback has to be set as the "complete" option
[14:25:48] <antlong> anyone looking for a quick side gig
[14:25:50] <Ptsnanan> Guys!!
[14:26:32] <pearo> shoky ah I see what you mean with starting an animation anytime. Awesome- thanks! what's a "complete" option? Sorry, I'm still really new at this
[14:26:37] <Ptsnanan> Would've some way of set when the selector isn't selecting?
[14:26:59] <Ptsnanan> For example like in php if(!something){...}
[14:27:02] <shoky> pearo: in the 2nd fiddle you're using this version of .animate:  .animate(properties, options)
[14:27:33] <shoky> pearo: so the callback has to be passed as the "complete" property of the options object. just like you're passing in "queue" and "duration" options
[14:29:00] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan test the length
[14:32:55] <Ptsnanan> What I need to so is like ::  if not select such thing so....
[14:33:11] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan right - test the length...
[14:33:19] <Ptsnanan> mm..
[14:33:21] <Ptsnanan> Ok.
[14:33:24] <Ptsnanan> I will see
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> if ($('#theThing').length) { /* selector matched */}
[14:33:54] <duch_kazatel> if (!$('#theThing').length) { /* selector found nothing */ }
[14:34:48] <pearo> shoky so it would be something like .animate({'opacity':'1'},{queue: false, duration: 500, function(){ } })?....
[14:35:04] <shoky> pearo:  .animate({'opacity':'1'},{queue: false, duration: 500, complete: function(){ } })
[14:35:14] <shoky> it's all in the docs
[14:36:04] <wa5ted> quick question: getting index from an unordered list
[14:36:06] <wa5ted> on hover
[14:36:11] <wa5ted> getting the index of hovered li
[14:37:21] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery index
[14:37:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .index() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/index/
[14:37:25] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[14:38:20] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/9WHLR/
[14:38:38] <pearo> shoky thanks a lot- i'm reading up on the complete right now
[14:40:51] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: thanks
[14:42:41] <Ptsnanan> I'm sorry guys for make many questions
[14:42:46] <Ptsnanan> But now I have a little question
[14:43:05] <Ptsnanan> with the event.target how can I get the properties of tag
[14:43:19] <Ptsnanan> If I want to show the val, of text propertie
[14:43:19] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan "the properties of tag" - clarify.
[14:43:21] <Ptsnanan> ..
[14:43:41] <duch_kazatel> are you using .on() or a similar method for your event binding?
[14:44:09] <Ptsnanan> For example :: <a onclick='my_event(event)'>Something</a>
[14:44:13] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[14:44:24] <duch_kazatel> don't put js in your html.
[14:44:54] <Ptsnanan> in the jquery script will be some like :::  function my_event(event){alert(event.target)}
[14:45:08] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan let me show you the right way to do that.
[14:45:14] <Ptsnanan> But for example If I would like to show the "Something" text
[14:45:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/z36d5/
[14:45:50] <duch_kazatel> do this instead.
[14:46:06] <Ptsnanan> I'm working a few deep about the Dom properties and doesn't allow me get the selector from jquery
[14:46:20] <duch_kazatel> Ptsnanan look at what i just sent you.
[14:46:40] <Ptsnanan> yes I know do it like that
[14:46:57] <Ptsnanan> But I don't know why doesn't allow me get the selector from jquery
[14:46:57] <duch_kazatel> look at your console - that's how you get the text of a clicked link.
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:47:15] <Ptsnanan> of the way that I show is possible?
[14:47:58] <duch_kazatel> you earlier asked about getting the text, now you're asking about the selector even though your code doesn't make use of one.
[14:48:05] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want the tagname?
[14:50:03] <duch_kazatel> can't understand what you're asking for.
[14:52:50] <Ptsnanan> using the onlick vent from html, in jquery are there some way of get the properties of tag?
[14:52:59] <Ptsnanan> That's my question
[14:53:41] <duch_kazatel> sure, but if you have jquery don't put your binding inline.
[14:55:20] <duch_kazatel> event.target in your example is the node - you can pass that to the $() function just like any other node.
[14:55:59] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: is it possible for a unroderlist, to hide the text but not the bullet without setting text to null
[14:56:05] <wa5ted> unorderedlist
[14:57:00] <duch_kazatel> a UL, you mean?
[14:57:14] <duch_kazatel> and it should be, but why?
[15:04:29] <d0de> I'm a bit confused by an API I'm using. The main function is called like this: " feed.load(feedLoaded); " and that triggers this function: " feedLoaded(result) " but how does the parameter "result" get passed when it's not passed in the original callback?
[15:04:43] <d0de> in other words, where does "result" come from?
[15:04:57] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: i need to hover voer each li in a ul and have the text for the hovered li to fade in
[15:05:02] <wa5ted> and fade out on mouse out
[15:05:29] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted ah - put a span around the text within each <li> and style that.
[15:05:44] <duch_kazatel> d0de check out the source :)
[15:05:54] <d0de> it's the google feeds API, and it doesn't even include the word "result"
[15:05:58] <d0de> https://www.google.com/jsapi
[15:06:02] <d0de> or a function called "load"
[15:06:16] <duch_kazatel> let me cook up an example.
[15:08:56] <duch_kazatel> d0de
[15:09:00] <d0de> yep?
[15:09:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/A9crB/
[15:09:17] <duch_kazatel> see where I call smartDeferOnError at the end?
[15:09:46] <duch_kazatel> I pass it the function object - it then calls the function for me.
[15:10:26] <duch_kazatel> with an argument: http://jsfiddle.net/A9crB/1/
[15:11:37] <duch_kazatel> that make a little more sense?
[15:11:44] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: without using a plugin is there any way i can scroll to an element using the elements id
[15:11:47] <wa5ted> smoothly
[15:12:13] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I think so, thank you very much
[15:12:17] <duch_kazatel> d0de yep.
[15:12:29] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted define "smoothly"
[15:12:45] <wa5ted> as in it eases
[15:12:47] <wa5ted> to the section
[15:12:55] <wa5ted> instead of skips to the section like wikipedia
[15:13:24] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6677069/923919
[15:13:41] <duch_kazatel> this doesn't use an easing. but should get you started.
[15:17:43] <styles> Not really a js developer, getting stuck doing it. I've used JQuery enough so I'm starting there. I know there are frameworks like JS for binding, but you also have AngularJS now and all these other wild frameworks. I need to do some pull ajax -> bind to a template that repeats type thing. What do you guys recommend?
[15:17:51] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:18:02] <duch_kazatel> styles wut?  "frameworks like JS"?
[15:18:18] <styles> frameworks in js*
[15:18:37] <duch_kazatel> hahaha okay.
[15:20:09] <duch_kazatel> styles you have a lot of options.  you could handle some of that work yourself with some jquery.  there's also backbone, angular, riot...
[15:26:19] <tandroid> hey guys, I'm trying to figure out if an image path is valid or not but the current way I'm doing it I can't do a conditional statement on. http://jsfiddle.net/ebZEM/
[15:27:43] <duch_kazatel> why can't you?
[15:27:45] <tandroid> Basically, I want to do something on image load success, not error.
[15:27:56] <tandroid> Well, I'm hoping I'm wrong...
[15:28:02] <duch_kazatel> tandroid easy - bind to the load event.

[15:42:11] <axilla> that's all
[15:42:21] <duch_kazatel> $(id_name).css('background-color','#ffffff !important'); this should work fine then...
[15:42:27] <axilla> hmm
[15:42:29] <axilla> its not
[15:42:32] <damasceno> Hello. I need to validate the data using JavaScript and if everything goes well I need to show a dialog to confirm, I need to use Jquery Mobile Dialog, this code works: http://jsfiddle.net/jquerybyexample/8LCRc/light/ but there will be no click action I need to call it from the JavaScript. Is there a way to do that? Thanks!
[15:43:35] <duch_kazatel> axilla do a console.log() of that object right before then.
[15:44:18] <duch_kazatel> see if that doesn't highlight the problem.
[15:44:49] <MetalHead77> In jQuery, what's the easiest way to get my website visitor's continent location? (For example "North America" or "Africa")
[15:46:13] <axilla> duch_kazatel: man, that's so extremely weird
[15:46:19] <axilla> after doing that it started working =/
[15:46:54] <duch_kazatel> axilla can you create a fiddle?
[15:47:33] <duch_kazatel> MetalHead77 you'll need to search for the geolocation api
[15:47:53] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: I did and I don't see how it will get me the continent.
[15:48:01] <duch_kazatel> MetalHead77 though if all you REALLY need is the continet, http://stackoverflow.com/a/3528512/923919
[15:49:17] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: That doesn't seem to give results at all. When checking the js fiddle, all it did was alert "undefined".
[15:49:58] <duch_kazatel> MetalHead77 the answer above that http://stackoverflow.com/a/3528512/923919
[15:50:18] <duch_kazatel> get their ip and look it up against something like maxmind or hostip.info
[15:51:04] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: What answer are you talking about?
[15:51:16] <duch_kazatel> " 5 down vote accepted
[15:51:16] <duch_kazatel> 	
[15:51:16] <duch_kazatel> You don't need to locate the user if you only need their country. You can look their ip up in any ip to location service (hostip.info, maxmind). This will be accurate most of the time.
[15:51:25] <duch_kazatel> woops sorry 'bout that paste.
[15:51:27] <duch_kazatel> but that answer.
[15:51:35] <frank_o> Anybody familiar with http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js (header that disappears / reappears on hover)?
[15:51:45] <frank_o> Why would `.column { position: absolute; }` cause it to stop working? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qP3cA/3/
[15:51:46] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ frank_o
[15:51:46] <b-ot> frank_o: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:51:53] <duch_kazatel> hah there we go.
[15:52:03] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: A little quick on the trigger there lol
[15:52:38] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: I'm still wondering which solution will give the continent..
[15:52:38] <duch_kazatel> sorry - 9/10 when people ask that and then leave it there.
[15:54:31] <frank_o> yeah its true :)
[15:54:34] <duch_kazatel> MetalHead77 the one where you get the user's IP and then hit a 3rd party service to get you that info.
[15:56:00] <duch_kazatel> frank_o this might help you: http://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/
[16:02:12] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: unfortunately the content must be position absolute due to some other requirements
[16:02:53] <duch_kazatel> sure - so now with what you know, how might you fix the problem?
[16:03:50] <frank_o> thats a very good question :))
[16:04:00] <duch_kazatel> wrap the contents in a div ;)
[16:04:31] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[16:04:33] * frank_o stops writing his StackOverflow question
[16:06:41] <fschuindt> Guys, there is something wrong with my tiny function of autoscroll a overflow div? https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/e5513eda89a7e711177b It's not working and I can't figure out why.
[16:07:26] <duch_kazatel> fschuindt console.log($("#messages_box").scrollHeight) - what does that get you?
[16:08:13] <fschuindt> duch_kazatel: undefined, lol
[16:08:22] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[16:08:28] <fschuindt> haha
[16:08:35] <fschuindt> ty
[16:11:04] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: not really sure what to do with the wrapper tbh
[16:11:16] <frank_o> reading your link right now though
[16:11:51] <duch_kazatel> damasceno you have a few options - you can use .trigger() on the link that launches it.
[16:12:26] <duch_kazatel> damasceno the documentation also says "You can open a dialog programmatically by calling the $.mobile.changePage method:"
[16:12:30] <duch_kazatel> on http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/
[16:14:26] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: it didn't work let me try again.
[16:15:07] <duch_kazatel> damasceno should be pretty easy - $.mobile.changePage( "#myDialog", { role: "dialog" } );
[16:15:59] <damasceno> Yeah I know, but I have to do a body.innerHTML to insert the dialog html code, right? Otherwise the code would be displayed in my main page.
[16:16:17] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:16:36] <duch_kazatel> the dialog is all ready in the example you sent...

[16:25:46] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: animating opacity
[16:25:49] <wa5ted> using css3
[16:25:52] <wa5ted> is it possible?
[16:25:59] <wa5ted> using transition
[16:26:21] <duch_kazatel> did you try googling for it?
[16:26:26] <wa5ted> yes
[16:26:37] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/keyframe-animation-syntax/
[16:26:41] <duch_kazatel> second result for me...
[16:26:45] <wa5ted> yeah i was just aobut to say
[16:26:50] <wa5ted> if i wanted to do it using
[16:26:54] <wa5ted> transition: transform 0.75s;
[16:26:57] <wa5ted> instead of keyframes
[16:27:30] <duch_kazatel> also: http://bavotasan.com/2011/a-simple-fade-with-css3/
[16:28:22] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: why does it not work with transition: transform 0.75s;
[16:28:29] <wa5ted> but work with transition: opactiy transform 0.75s;
[16:28:32] <wa5ted> opactiy
[16:28:36] <wa5ted> opacity
[16:29:33] <duch_kazatel> because you have to tell it what to animate iirc.
[16:29:55] <wa5ted> really? cause ive used it just like that no specification
[16:29:57] <wa5ted> and it works
[16:30:05] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions#A_simple_exampledoe
[16:30:15] <duch_kazatel> there are other ways to tell it what you're going to transition
[16:30:25] <duch_kazatel> but it doesn't just know.
[16:42:07] <xniz> good day duch_kazatel
[16:42:12] <duch_kazatel> hello
[16:42:14] <uskerine> is it possible to store form input values in a HTML without a server? -i mean just JS or JQuery-
[16:42:55] <duch_kazatel> uskerine you mean "save"?
[16:43:13] <duch_kazatel> so the values persist after you close the browser?
[16:43:16] <uskerine> yeah, i mean save
[16:43:27] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:43:28] <uskerine> ideally at a file i can pick up, or in the html itself (i guess that's not possible)
[16:43:29] <antlong> looking for help with a web game. its open source, js/css/html, sci-fi rpg/sim. if you're interested message me. theres about 15 of us working on it.
[16:44:34] <xniz> antlong, i would love to be of help, sadly my days are filled :(. I am familiar with FPS engines and animations though. I was working on a javascript version of the old street fighter game for SNES
[16:44:41] <xniz> was awsome really :D
[16:45:14] <antlong> xniz very nice, we're about a week in to it, and trying to sew up some combat right now
[16:45:18] <xniz> antlong, i'd like to see any progress towards the project though and help support it :)
[16:45:29] <xniz> antlong, you already have sprites ?
[16:45:31] <antlong> xniz www.multiverseminer.com - #multiverseminer you're welcome to hang and chat
[16:45:43] <antlong> we have items and armor, gems and minerals and elements
[16:45:59] <xniz> ahh i see
[16:46:00] <antlong> we're limited by how much art we can produce right now.
[16:46:05] <antlong> we need a lot of pixel art :)
[16:46:07] <xniz> yes i can tell :P
[16:46:25] <antlong> scroll down
[16:46:29] <antlong> travel to another planet
[16:46:31] <antlong> its cool :)
[16:46:32] <xniz> ahhh
[16:46:49] <antlong> I'm trying to find someone to move that solar system to a modal
[16:47:11] <xniz> ahhh nice animation
[16:47:31] <antlong> we're still in the proof of concept phase. its just been a week or so now.
[16:47:31] <xniz> definately need some better gfx, but looking good so far :). are you going to implement a user system/database or?
[16:47:42] <antlong> yeah, were going to move to node when we begin multiplayer
[16:48:19] <xniz> cool cool. I was never into RPG type games.  I played a text-based IRC rpg game some years ago.. maybe in 2002. that is about as far as I went in regards to RPG games heh
[16:48:40] <xniz> and coded a few text-based games myself using mIRC code hehe. so I am good at stats/calculations
[16:48:46] <antlong> i like them, i almost like muds though
[16:48:52] <antlong> originally i was going to make this a mud
[16:48:53] <xniz> yeah same thing as a mud really
[16:48:58] <xniz> text-based games :P
[16:49:12] <xniz> not many people appreciate those anymore heh
[16:49:36] <antlong> no, its a dying (art?)
[16:50:09] <xniz> sadly :(. I used to play a DragonBall Z IRC mud
[16:50:16] <antlong> haha
[16:50:17] <xniz> was freaking awsome. would play for hours hehe.
[16:50:21] <xniz> back when I was about 12-13
[16:50:26] <antlong> i still play one or two a couple of hours a month
[16:50:39] <uskerine> how can i see the VALUE of a form with firebug or inspect element ?
[16:50:44] <xniz> awsome. wish i could get back into it. :)
[16:50:47] <uskerine> value of an input in a form
[16:51:09] <duch_kazatel> uskerine wat
[16:51:28] <uskerine> I have a web site, i have loaded all the values of a form with a JQuery function
[16:51:38] <uskerine> now I would like to chek if a hidden field/input element has been properly loaded
[16:51:50] <uskerine> can i do just with "inspect element" or "firebug"?
[16:52:00] <duch_kazatel> you can use firebug to do that, sure.
[16:52:07] <duch_kazatel> if it's hidden, find it in the rendered page.
[16:52:58] <uskerine> where?
[16:53:05] <duch_kazatel> wherever you put it.
[16:53:06] <uskerine> I can't even see the values for the non-hidden elements
[16:53:37] <uskerine> i lcoalize the element, but just can't find the value property (even when i clearly see it on the screen)
[16:54:18] <uskerine> found it
[16:54:20] <uskerine> it was in DOM tag
[16:54:41] <duch_kazatel> the HTML tab will show you all the rendered markup, including hidden stuff.
[16:58:43] <chixuclub> hi there
[16:59:51] <chixuclub> i don't understand why my code runs with anonymous functions and doesnt with named functions : http://jsfiddle.net/8yWYV/1/
[17:03:21] <duch_kazatel> chixuclub because $( "#thing" ).change(doSomething()); is trying to bind the result of that method to that handler.
[17:03:24] <duch_kazatel> you want $( "#thing" ).change(doSomething);
[17:09:42] <uskerine> does .show() property affect display attribute?
[17:10:34] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/show/
[17:11:23] <duch_kazatel> the docs tell you.
[17:13:37] <uskerine> thanks, sorry I am doing too many questions. I assume from the doc that is equivalent to do display: block
[17:15:05] <BillCriswell> I need to mess around with SVG more.
[17:15:10] <blindMoe> yeah you do
[17:15:46] <duch_kazatel> uskerine read the docs.
[17:15:52] <duch_kazatel> it tells you exactly what it does.
[17:15:53] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:16:01] <duch_kazatel> uskerine have you considered going to learn.jquery.com?
[17:16:17] <uskerine> I actually have planned to read "Head First JQuery"
[17:16:31] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: that's what I'm talking about: http://jsfiddle.net/fXsYZ/ I need to hide it and show only if the typed text was "ok"...
[17:16:32] <uskerine> but I did not managed to get enough time
[17:16:48] <uskerine> I am learning the hard way but after finishing this I would like to read it and fill in the gaps
[17:16:55] <uskerine> (which are many and big)
[17:16:59] <duch_kazatel> damasceno you have jquery available.  just use it.
[17:18:40] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: I'm sorry but I'm new with Jquery :S.
[17:19:41] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[17:19:50] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/LHM9E/ <-- i want to make it so that if i spam the hover it wont go crazy
[17:20:07] <wa5ted> http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/
[17:20:15] <wa5ted> ^end result of the nav should look as such
[17:20:22] <wa5ted> the one that apple uses
[17:20:40] <duch_kazatel> damasceno http://jsfiddle.net/fXsYZ/1/
[17:20:42] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[17:20:47] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: I really appreciate, sorry. :S
[17:21:43] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted you need to cancel the current animation before going to the next one then.
[17:21:44] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: ok you changed a few things, but the dialog is being showed at the beginning.
[17:22:03] <duch_kazatel> damasceno is was being shown in the beginning befor.e
[17:22:20] <duch_kazatel> that's all there is...
[17:22:46] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: yh figured that
[17:22:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LHM9E/1/
[17:22:55] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted ^
[17:22:59] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: I accessed the link you sent me and it shows the Dialog without clicking on the button. :S
[17:23:09] <duch_kazatel> damasceno just like yours was before...
[17:23:19] <damasceno> I need to hide it and when I click if the text was "OK" it should show the dialog.
[17:23:19] <duch_kazatel> damasceno there's nothing else on the page, so what would it show instead...?
[17:23:26] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: What's wrong with just :hover?
[17:23:33] <wa5ted> i could use that
[17:23:42] <wa5ted> for some reason when i try to do a transition
[17:23:44] <wa5ted> it doesnt work
[17:23:52] <beancurd> css transition?
[17:23:56] <duch_kazatel> damasceno you're in over your head.
[17:24:00] <damasceno> It should show the text and the button, that's it. if the text typed was "ok" so it should show the Dialog.
[17:24:23] <duch_kazatel> damasceno then create the example that ISN'T showing the dialog on load.
[17:24:32] <duch_kazatel> or go read some tutorials to better understand what you're doing.
[17:24:58] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: but I did that exactly to show you what's my problem o.O
[17:25:06] <wa5ted> of course the infamous beancurd is here
[17:25:15] <beancurd> sup bro
[17:26:49] <duch_kazatel> damasceno what do you expect the page to show when everything is a dialog?
[17:26:53] <duch_kazatel> you haven't given it anything else...
[17:27:20] <duch_kazatel> go do a tutorial first.
[17:28:24] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: I know that, but I'm new at this. I've read the Jquery Dialog page. I just need to show this dialog when the result in the javascript function is TRUE, that's it. Unfortunately for this case I can't use a simple alert()... that's why I'm looking for the right way to use the Dialog. :S
[17:28:50] <duch_kazatel> damasceno your issue is that you don't understand the fundamental structure you need for the page.
[17:29:07] <duch_kazatel> damasceno link that example from earlier.  the one with the working dialog.
[17:29:10] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you there.
[17:30:38] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: Do you mean this one? http://jsfiddle.net/8LCRc/9/
[17:30:42] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: how come when i trasnition opacity it is blurry
[17:30:52] <duch_kazatel> damasceno yeah let me show you.
[17:30:53] <wa5ted> transition from 0 to 1 for opactiy
[17:30:56] <damasceno> It works, but it's not what I'm looking for.
[17:31:00] <disorder20> hi
[17:31:06] <duch_kazatel> damasceno easy change.
[17:31:09] <damasceno> The user won't click on anything.
[17:31:15] <duch_kazatel> damasceno right...
[17:31:21] <duch_kazatel> you want to check against an input, right?
[17:31:24] <damasceno> Sorry just to be clear...
[17:31:25] <duch_kazatel> because that's simple...
[17:32:04] <damasceno> Yes, it goes to a function called Register, and there after I check what the user typed it will show the dialog.
[17:32:16] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:32:20] <duch_kazatel> i will show you how to do that.
[17:32:59] <duch_kazatel> and don't use inline event handlers btw.
[17:33:55] <damasceno> got it.
[17:34:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8LCRc/10/
[17:35:43] <duch_kazatel> actually even better: http://jsfiddle.net/8LCRc/10/
[17:36:18] <duch_kazatel> errrm i mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/8LCRc/11/
[17:36:53] <xniz> ok so.. I am using PHP+MySQL+json to create an array of objects. each object stores reference to a specific gallery image. however, when looping through the array and loading new image objects, they are loaded out of order of the original SQL query, even though the array is sorted. How can I fix this? I am not sure if i explained that correctly..
[17:37:56] <duch_kazatel> xniz and you're actually using arrays in JS?
[17:38:11] <duch_kazatel> hard to understand what you're doing without seeing the broken part.
[17:38:13] <xniz> duch_kazatel, is that bad?
[17:38:20] <xniz> well its complicated really :/
[17:38:28] <duch_kazatel> sometimes people think they're using arrays when they're not.
[17:38:32] <duch_kazatel> that's why i ask.
[17:38:45] <xniz> oh. well I'm pretty sure its an array... one moment ill paste the code
[17:39:02] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: thank you very much, I'm going to try it! :D
[17:41:56] <xniz> duch_kazatel, http://pastie.org/9226942 <-- sorry if the code is a bit... sloppy/newbish. i am a bit rusty
[17:42:18] <xniz> but that is the "core" of what I am doing I guess you could say
[17:42:32] <duch_kazatel> this... doesn't tell me what i asked.
[17:42:53] <xniz> errr. you asked if I was using arrays..?
[17:42:56] <duch_kazatel> but seeing new Image(), new Array(), etc tells me you're making this overly complicated.
[17:43:06] <xniz> hmm
[17:43:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm asking about the data coming back from your server.
[17:43:26] <xniz> oh... the sql data?
[17:43:37] <duch_kazatel> the JSON from your server.
[17:46:47] <BillCriswell> Man, it's easy to make some ugly things ugly with scale lol
[17:46:58] <duch_kazatel> well put.
[17:47:04] <duch_kazatel> amplified ugly.
[17:48:42] <xniz> duch_kazatel, err... I don't know how to answer that really. to be honest, I am new to the idea of using json. however, http://pastie.org/9226968 <-- is the content of my gallery.php if that helps
[17:48:54] <duch_kazatel> i don't know PHP =/
[17:50:06] <xniz> well.. i know my problem lies within the init() function of Gallery... more directly the img.load function.
[17:50:24] <duch_kazatel> why are you using a constructor pattern in this case?
[17:51:13] <xniz> duch_kazatel, just going off of some old code I had written a few years back from a game engine. no specific reason. as I said, I am a bit rusty :/
[17:52:29] <shoky> what does  $var[] = $obj;   do
[17:53:22] <shoky> o i see
[17:53:23] <xniz> loads the SQL row from the query.
[17:54:19] <xniz> stuffs it into a php array, then passes it to json.
[17:54:30] <shoky> don't need to initialize the array?
[17:55:21] <xniz> shoky, not from the references I used.
[17:56:24] <xniz> shoky, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383631/json-encode-mysql-results <-- one of the references I used.
[17:56:24] <shoky> anyway, your loop is looping from index 1 instead of 0
[17:56:27] <shoky> in js
[17:56:38] <shoky> though you're inserting items starting from index 1 it seems
[17:56:38] <xniz> shoky, I see that.
[17:56:41] <xniz> indeed
[17:56:57] <xniz> its got to do with the browser loading the image out of order. that is the only explanation
[17:57:37] <xniz> for example.. if i place console.log(count); above var img = new Image(); the order is correct.
[17:57:40] <shoky> oh, that was the issue?
[17:57:47] <shoky> well... duh ;]
[17:57:47] <xniz> yes. that is the issue, i am sure of it
[17:58:27] <shoky> browser will load the images in any order it pleases
[17:58:36] <xniz> shoky, exactly. however it works out
[17:58:45] <xniz> I need to find a way to fix that :/
[17:58:58] <duch_kazatel> wait the load order or the display order?
[17:59:27] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: http://jsbin.com/rexarida/2/edit?css,output I thought this would end up better but it didn't haha.
[17:59:46] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  essentially.. even though the code is telling the browser to load it in order, it will be different each time.. it may load the second image faster than the first.
[18:00:04] <xniz> due to filesize, connection, etc etc whatever the reason.
[18:00:06] <duch_kazatel> xniz oh... i thought the display order is what you cared about.
[18:00:38] <shoky> xniz: btw that reference you used DOES initialize the array
[18:00:38] <xniz> well.. sometimes, on the gallery page.. it loads the images in order, images 1-5. then sometimes, image 2 may load before image 1
[18:00:46] <xniz> shoky, ahh ok
[18:01:05] <xniz> well to see what I mean.. http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/ <---
[18:01:05] <duch_kazatel> xniz you need to manually queue yourself.
[18:01:14] <duch_kazatel> but that shouldn't matter...
[18:01:18] <duch_kazatel> load order should be irrelevant.
[18:01:37] <xniz> well that page ^, if you click on the gallery. you can see the images load correctly 1-5, sometimes it doesnt.
[18:01:45] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:01:50] <xniz> idk im at a loss really :/
[18:01:56] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: it does look good
[18:01:56] <duch_kazatel> display, or load.
[18:02:03] <duch_kazatel> display.
[18:02:05] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: That scale is gross.
[18:02:12] <wa5ted> i know
[18:02:15] <wa5ted> i went a differnt route
[18:02:38] <duch_kazatel> xniz i'd have to completely rip your stuff apart to fix it.  looks like your server isn't sending in order though.
[18:02:39] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: trying to figure out how to unbind the damn scrollbar
[18:02:39] <xniz> duch_kazatel, i thought the order in which the image object loads is the order it is displayed?
[18:02:45] <wa5ted> scrollwheel
[18:02:45] <duch_kazatel> xniz nope.
[18:02:52] <duch_kazatel> xniz the order the HTML is written determines that.
[18:03:00] <duch_kazatel> the order everything loads is ancillary to that.
[18:03:06] <duch_kazatel> make sure the html is right.
[18:03:12] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i leave.
[18:04:37] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I never tried it.
[18:05:04] <wa5ted> damn why does jquery librry not come with  scrollwheel event
[18:05:11] <BillCriswell> I'm not a fan of that behavior to be honest.
[18:12:16] <frank_o> Why does http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js (header that disappears / reappears on hover) stop working once I add `.column { position: absolute; }`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qP3cA/3/
[18:12:27] <frank_o> Unfortunately I need to absolute position my columns due to http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/YS5QN/10/
[18:15:35] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: if i use .next() and i am on the last child of l<li>s
[18:15:41] <wa5ted> will it go to the first child
[18:15:45] <wa5ted> if i do antoher .next()
[18:16:13] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: No.
[18:22:25] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: You could use like .eq(-1) if there's no .next()
[18:22:39] <wa5ted> true
[18:26:13] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: or keep track of the index and just use eq() throughout.
[18:26:19] <wa5ted> true
[18:28:47] <telesto> I feel like I'm missing something obvious here, but all of the sudden jQuery isn't working right on a page of mine. It seems to be loaded ( 'jQuery' returns a function in the console), but when I type $('body').hide(); I get TypeError: Cannot read property 'hide' of null
[18:28:50] <telesto> Same error for any element on the page
[18:29:34] <BillCriswell> telesto: $ could be getting jacked by something, try jQuery('body').hide();
[18:30:02] <telesto> BillCriswell: Doh, of course! I forgot that happens. That worked. Any easy way to debug what might be doing that?
[18:30:58] <BillCriswell> telesto: No clue haha. How about just typing $ on the command line.
[18:32:11] <telesto> BillCriswell: Huh, I'm not sure what this output could be pointing to: http://jsbin.com/bataxiri/1/edit
[18:32:53] <BillCriswell> telesto: Looks like prototype.
[18:33:27] <BillCriswell> Damn, googling that whole function worked haha.
[18:34:01] <telesto> BillCriswell: Hah! what do you know. Thanks man, not even sure what's including that but I'll dig into it
[18:34:17] <BillCriswell> telesto: That's always fun.
[18:35:40] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: 2 questions how do i get the scroll behaviour like  http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/
[18:35:48] <wa5ted> 1 question i mean
[18:36:10] <wa5ted> like particularly when i use the scroll wheel
[18:36:26] <wa5ted> how do i get the scrollwheel
[18:36:38] <beancurd> oh my goodness.
[18:36:44] <wa5ted> to prevent scroll spamming
[18:37:32] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I'm not sure. I don't like the behavior enough to look into it either haha.
[18:37:42] <wa5ted> lol
[18:37:45] <wa5ted> for me :P
[18:37:51] <beancurd> that page craps itself if one uses arrow keys.
[18:38:00] <beancurd> in ff
[18:38:41] <wa5ted> beancurd: any help
[18:38:47] <wa5ted> in disecting the scrollbehaviour
[18:39:10] <beancurd> wa5ted: you can do .scroll(), then make sure the next frame has completely loaded before allowing capture of the next scroll() event.
[18:39:44] <wa5ted> true
[18:39:57] <wa5ted> but does that mean i need to read the scrollwheel event
[18:40:09] <beancurd> nope.
[18:40:22] <beancurd> you want to scroll event. incase people use the keyboard to navigate.
[18:40:31] <beancurd> space, shift+space, arrowkeys.
[18:40:53] <beancurd> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/ capturing this event should be enough?
[18:43:36] <walruslt> Hello, good evening
[18:43:46] <wa5ted> beancurd: how should i prevent next scroll
[18:44:06] <walruslt> could someone help me with ajax loading content with links
[18:45:05] <beancurd> wa5ted: when you catch the event, fire a thingy to make the next slide show up. once the slide finishes its animation, toggle a "completed" / or "oktoscrollnext" variable.
[18:45:06] <walruslt> i have question on stackowerflow, and maybe someone could review it and post help answer there or point something out just here
[18:45:09] <walruslt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23901512/class-jquery-ajax-callback-does-not-work-after-from-loaded-content
[18:45:39] <beancurd> wa5ted: then use that variable to determine whether or not you should ignore the subsequent scrll events.
[18:51:38] <walruslt> anyone out here?
[18:52:34] <wa5ted> we are
[18:52:42] <walruslt> cool!
[18:52:55] <walruslt> Could you help me out
[18:52:57] <walruslt> please
[18:55:10] <__joshua___> make a jsfiddle
[18:55:16] <__joshua___> or similar
[18:57:06] <__joshua___> $( ".ajaxRequest" ).on('click', function(){ $.get($(this).attr('href').done(function(data){ jContent.append( data );}); return false;});
[18:57:33] <__joshua___> forgot closing bracket on  $.get($(this).attr('href'))
[18:58:57] <SkiOne> doing an excersize for a new job. When you click the color it should populate the votes column but its not http://achieve3000.myclient-review.com/ its probably stupid but its late and I am tired can anyone see whats wrong?
[19:00:57] <__joshua___> IDs shouldn't start with  a number
[19:01:24] <BillCriswell> SkiOne: Are you supposed to be just adding JS to this or editing HTML / CSS?
[19:03:30] <__joshua___> he is nearly there. its doing post every click

[19:04:01] <wa5ted> ^the mousewheel stuff is buggy
[19:04:36] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: Ah.
[19:05:26] <__joshua___> SkiOne: all of your votes cells have the same id
[19:06:09] <SkiOne> OMG, thanks. I knew it was something stupid
[19:06:23] <walruslt> __joshua__ it, does'nt work
[19:08:50] <__joshua___> walruslt: are you getting an error
[19:09:55] <frank_o> Anybody familiar with http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js (header that disappears / reappears on scroll)? Why does it stop working once I add `.column { position: absolute; }`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qP3cA/3/ vs. http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qP3cA/4/
[19:10:13] <frank_o> Unfortunately I need to absolute position my columns due to http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/YS5QN/10/
[19:10:38] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: any assist  when you get a chance
[19:10:39] <wa5ted> ^^^
[19:10:42] <wa5ted> link above
[19:11:20] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Not in the mood for that haha.
[19:11:45] <wa5ted> damn
[19:11:46] <wa5ted> :(
[19:12:09] <__joshua___> frank_o: what are you trying to achieve? you want the second column absolutely positoned on the right side?
[19:12:48] <__joshua___> or you mean the bottom bar?
[19:14:19] <Alchemy> hey all I am doing an ajax xhr request on click of a form the start of it goes like this ...
[19:14:20] <Alchemy> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=mxYBGh1r
[19:14:34] <Alchemy> that if im writing
[19:14:45] <Alchemy> I want to check the length of the input fields are not null
[19:14:52] <Alchemy> what would I use to do that ..
[19:14:55] <__joshua___> that if will always be true
[19:15:02] <Alchemy> the if is not complete
[19:15:07] <Alchemy> thats what I need help with ;)
[19:15:14] <__joshua___> ah
[19:15:27] <Alchemy> the two inputs are called 'name' and type'
[19:15:30] <Alchemy> and of are type 'text'
[19:15:35] <walruslt> __joshua__ on jsfiddle it works, but when i try code on localhost it just redirect's to another page
[19:15:37] <walruslt> http://jsfiddle.net/DkELg/
[19:15:41] <Alchemy> 'name' is the one I want to check against
[19:16:06] <Alchemy> well name='name'
[19:16:16] <__joshua___> walruslt: definately return false on local machine?
[19:16:59] <walruslt> yes
[19:17:47] <__joshua___> $('form').on('submit', function(){ return $(this).find('[name=name]).val() && $(this).find([name=type]).val()); });
[19:18:33] <Alchemy> hmm I was going to go for
[19:18:56] <__joshua___> walruslt:  does the first ajax call return a second link?
[19:18:59] <Alchemy> if( length( $(this).parent().closest( jquery magic for seraching for name ). ).val > 0)
[19:19:19] <Alchemy> how do you search for a name selector anyhow
[19:19:30] <walruslt> what do you mean
[19:19:32] <__joshua___> i just gave you example
[19:19:36] <Alchemy> ah name
[19:19:39] <Alchemy> doh thank you
[19:20:53] <__joshua___> walruslt: does the first ajax call return html that contains the second link?
[19:21:03] <__joshua___> lemme check your stackoverflow q
[19:21:38] <__joshua___> ah yes it does.  there is your problem.  you bind the  click listener before the element exists
[19:21:52] <walruslt> with your example you provide, it just links to another page
[19:22:00] <__joshua___> two choices:  bind it again, after the ajax call, or use a delegate
[19:22:16] <__joshua___> yes, because the second a href doesn't have a click listener
[19:23:18] <__joshua___> naive delegate solution:  $('body').on('click',  ".ajaxRequest", function(){.....
[19:24:42] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: got an easier task, one can use .scrollTop and scroll to the offest on an element with an id
[19:24:53] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Right.
[19:24:57] <wa5ted> what if i want to figure out what is the last element that i crossed while csrolling
[19:25:02] <wa5ted> scrolling
[19:25:15] <wa5ted> eg. if i scrolled past the start of the portfolio section
[19:25:26] <wa5ted> a portfolio section*
[19:27:45] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: It would just be the section above the one you're currently on wouldn't it?
[19:28:00] <wa5ted> well yes
[19:28:04] <wa5ted> but how do i detect that
[19:28:21] <jphase> wa5ted: use a selector that grabs a series of elements and check the vertical scroll position of the window against those elements.
[19:28:42] <wa5ted> jphase: then i'd need a ton of if statements
[19:28:47] <wa5ted> what if the number of pages are unknown
[19:28:49] <jphase> their top offset that is
[19:29:01] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Store them in an array.
[19:29:03] <jphase> well you wouldn't need a ton of if statements
[19:29:06] <jphase> a loop
[19:29:20] <jphase> as soon as it's > than your scroll position, the previous one in the loop is your element
[19:32:15] <wa5ted> kk
[19:48:14] <sebastian> hi guys, how do I get allButLast elements in a collection?
[19:49:46] <__joshua___> in an array?  array.slice(0, array.length-1).
[19:51:11] <sebastian> well, this collection is an array
[19:52:07] <sebastian> cool thanks for the tip
[19:58:34] <wa5ted> jphase: got  some thing
[19:58:53] <wa5ted> http://paste.ofcode.org/4h8SbcYjNCmHMwBRRGXx6m
[19:58:57] <wa5ted> ^if you see there
[19:59:10] <wa5ted> oh heck let me show you in a fiddle
[19:59:27] <sebastian> doing array.slice gives me an extended array, can I stript it? how?
[19:59:53] <frank_o> __joshua___: sorry something came up
[20:00:22] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/6Cwhq/2/
[20:00:29] <wa5ted> ^if you look at the navigation to the right
[20:00:31] <wa5ted> it glitches
[20:00:35] <wa5ted> how can i prevent that glitching
[20:00:46] <wa5ted> well the class is being removed and reapplied
[20:00:48] <frank_o> __joshua___: basically im trying to apply headroom.js to my header but at the same time have absolute positioned columns
[20:00:53] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: ^^
[20:01:24] <jParkton> ok http://jsfiddle.net/jparkton/WF4Ka/
[20:01:35] <jParkton> am I doing better?
[20:02:20] <jParkton> just one hand so far
[20:02:24] <jParkton> next to animate it
[20:03:10] <jphase> wa5ted: looks like you're removing and reassigning the class "active" on the window scroll event, which will trigger at every vertical pixel of scroll
[20:03:42] <wa5ted> jphase: i know, how can i get the desired effect but not have it reapply the class
[20:07:09] <jphase> wa5ted: just check if it needs to be changed before changing it
[20:07:13] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6Cwhq/3/
[20:07:22] <LoneStar99> have the following code, and would like to have class="price-this" alternate background colors, what would be the best way to go about it -> http://jsfiddle.net/pozrdude/yt3XU/
[20:08:45] <jphase> LoneStar99: I'm confused, so you want a different color with each element you append?
[20:10:40] <LoneStar99> jphase: yes exactly, just alternate between 2 colors: #FFF and #E5E5E5
[20:11:10] <jphase> LoneStar99: and is the class what determines the color or do you want that done with jQuery?
[20:11:52] <LoneStar99> jphase: jquery
[20:12:03] <LoneStar99> trying to find a php example
[20:12:43] <jphase> LoneStar99: so since you only need two different colors I'd suggest using a "modulus" operator to check to see if it's odd or even and apply it that way, let me show you one sec
[20:13:15] <LoneStar99> yeah, was just reading something about modulus...
[20:14:05] <LoneStar99> have done it in php, but has been years...
[20:14:25] <jphase> LoneStar99: sec, sorta out of context with your example, have to repurpose this to work since I don't have any of your vars
[20:14:54] <LoneStar99> jphase: ok thanks
[20:17:11] <jphase> LoneStar99: so this is obviously just ham handed to work with what I have here, but it's basically what you need:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/yt3XU/1/
[20:17:52] <jphase> suppose you don't need to set oddeven to a variable though:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/yt3XU/2/
[20:18:19] <LoneStar99> jphase:  yeah that looks like what I need =)
[20:18:50] <jphase> LoneStar99: although, I'd actually suggest not doing this at all with jQuery tbh
[20:18:55] <jphase> do this with CSS ;)
[20:19:25] <jphase> a simple class name or any selector that allows you to identify the container of the elements will allow you to zebra stripe with nth-child
[20:20:39] <LoneStar99> jphase: ok will look into it, still developing so, everything might change closer to public viewing
[20:22:08] <jphase> LoneStar99: for example, this is the same thing without having to use jQuery to do anything but DOM manipulation:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/yt3XU/3/
[20:22:18] <jphase> let CSS do your styling whenever possible imo
[20:23:26] <LoneStar99> jphase: yeah all my styling is done via CSS, so might just keep it that way
[20:26:37] <LoneStar99> jphase: thanks looking at your code now
[20:26:47] <jphase> np
[20:32:56] <LoneStar99> jphase:  the CSS worked perfect =)  owe you a shot of fireball
[20:33:19] <jphase> hehe
[20:40:35] <jParkton> http://jsfiddle.net/jparkton/WF4Ka/
[20:41:15] <jParkton> How do I get the line to rotate once every second? Do I need to get the circumference and all that?
[20:47:57] <LoneStar99> jParkton: have you tried doing it with CSS?
[20:48:41] <LoneStar99> jParkton: kinda like -> http://lea.verou.me/2013/11/cleanest-css-spinner-ever/
[20:49:48] <jParkton> hm
[20:49:50] <jParkton> ok
[20:50:28] <LoneStar99> the css spinner code, will need to be tweaked to work with opera and chrome
[20:51:07] <walruslt> if i create attribute <a attribute="value"></a>, how could i get a > attribute?
[20:51:59] <walruslt> is it even legal, or moral? anyway, how techniclly could i do it
[20:53:29] <jphase> walruslt: are you wanted to select your elements that have your custom attribute?
[20:54:58] <jphase> jParkton: there's a few libraries out there for that too - raphael js is pretty awesome if you aren't totally afraid of math
[20:55:13] <jphase> i.e. http://raphaeljs.com/polar-clock.html
[20:55:51] <walruslt> i would like to create <div id="div-1"> <a closeid="div-1">Close Me!</a> </div>
[20:56:31] <walruslt> <div id="div-1"> <a closeid="div-1" class="close">Close Me!</a> </div>
[20:56:50] <jParkton> I thought to just use Math.PI and Math.floor
[20:56:58] <jphase> walruslt: I'd honestly suggest using data attributes for that since that's what they're meant for, but technically jQuery doesn't really discriminate on custom attributes
[20:57:09] <jParkton> assuming my canvas WxH is my Circumference?
[20:57:21] <jphase> jParkton: yeah, it's not too tough to do it manually
[20:58:15] <walruslt> then $( "body" ).delegate( ".close", "click", function() { ** here get $a.closeid and then .remove(div.$a.closeid) **
[20:59:06] <walruslt> i dont know how to get value of <a closeid="">
[21:00:04] <walruslt> any ideas, or help please?
[21:01:05] <walruslt> i try alert($( this ).attr( "closeid" )); but i get "undefined"
[21:01:08] <jParkton> jphase: can I just make Circ = 360 and do something like my seconds / Circ?
[21:01:16] <jParkton> to get my degrees
[21:01:20] <jphase> walruslt: yeah, it's easiest to use data attributes for that, so like... <a data-close-id="14">  or   <a data-closeid="14">    then you can just grab your stuff with $(this).data('close-id') or $(this).data('closeid')
[21:01:24] <jParkton> idk im tired lol
[21:02:04] <walruslt> cheers, i got it thank you
[21:04:36] <shoky> why did jPakton leave ;S  http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/1/
[21:04:42] <shoky> jParkton
[21:07:30] <jphase> I know, I was upset :(
[21:10:52] <bowenac_> hello all, can I get some tips on getting ajax response when running a php script?
[21:11:04] <bowenac_> trying to provide something to the user as it is processing
[21:11:25] <bowenac_> can I append in the ajax file to the front end?
[21:14:38] <walruslt> Anywone could still help me with attribute, i get "undefined"
[21:14:39] <walruslt> http://jsfiddle.net/pBQSv/1/
[21:18:30] <jphase> walruslt: closeid="1" isn't a data attribute, you need data-closeid="1"
[21:20:07] <jphase> walruslt: i.e.   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pBQSv/3/
[21:20:07] <walruslt> cheers, did'nt knew this or did'nt notice it
[21:21:56] <walruslt> cheers, jphase! You the best

[21:22:39] <walruslt> but maybe it's better delegate thank on?
[21:23:04] <walruslt> * thank .in
[21:23:06] <walruslt> * thank .on
[21:23:09] <aieq> how to access another DOM with jquery that was created with createHTMLDocument() ?
[21:23:34] <jphase> yeah, if they're dynamic elements you can delegate or just bind to the document with a child selector passed
[21:23:43] <jphase> otherwise just use .on
[21:25:39] <walruslt> it's for dynamicly loaded content
[21:26:01] <walruslt> how to v
[21:26:02] <walruslt>  bind to the document with a child selector passed
[21:26:09] <jphase> yeah I normally just use $(document).on('click', '.close', function(e) {  });
[21:26:33] <jphase> basically the same thing but still uses that short and sweet .on syntax
[21:28:39] <jphase> aieq: you'd have to target the iframe that the document was created in
[21:29:03] <aieq> its the same html page
[21:29:24] <aieq> i want to clone it, and manipulate it with jquery
[21:30:33] <jphase> yeah, from what I understand that just creates an HTML document and inserts it into an iframe
[21:30:52] <jphase> so you'd want to target that iframe and use .contents()
[21:32:23] <aieq> it creates an iframe?
[21:32:30] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FDOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument
[21:33:45] <aieq> thats just the example they are using
[21:33:50] <jphase> oh I guess maybe that's their example
[21:33:51] <jphase> ok
[21:34:46] <jphase> so does createHTMLDocument just create an html tag then?
[21:34:50] <jphase> I never use that :\
[21:36:16] <bowenac_> jphase be in all the channels
[21:36:27] <jphase> heh
[21:41:06] <jphase> aieq: it looks like createHTMLDocument is just a way to create a document in memory, so you can set it to a variable and then use it later
[21:55:10] <bowenac_>     $output = "Processing post $postTitle, Added image for post $postTitle to the library, file name $filename";     echo json_encode($output); would this be the correct way to show the user progress?
[21:55:36] <bowenac_> if so how would I get display that from the ajax file on the front end that started the ajax request
[21:59:17] <jop008> Does anaybody knwos a sortable list on jqm usgae?
[22:11:38] <jphase> jop008: you mean combining jquery ui sortable with jqm?
[22:16:17] <walruslt> what is that part when you load div or dialog and whant to make all other website unclickable, disabled or and made a little bit darker
[22:16:50] <shoky> modal
[22:18:35] <bowenac_> I never receive an ajax success response anything I need to do to get that? I can see in the console the get finishes and logs my echos and var dumps etc
[22:18:57] <bowenac_> and I get 200 ok so why is it not success
[22:19:18] <walruslt> what if i dinamicly get content with link and put in #div witch is displayed like dialog. another then load another box
[22:19:26] <walruslt> how to disable first box?
[22:19:35] <inntec> hey all, I am strugling with jQuery autocomplete. Mine autocomplete has minleght = 3 and now I need addd button which on click should show all available choices in that autocomplete
[22:19:50] <walruslt> but keep showing it
[22:24:10] <bowenac_> everyone must be sleeping
[22:28:57] <pearo> Can anyone shed some light as to why changing the background color doesn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/MRmEw/ I'm not getting any errors in console so not sure what the problem is
[22:38:55] <mfoxdogg|work> pearo, ummm the function is "showNextElement" you are calling changeNextElement
[22:39:10] <luxgeek> Hey all, first time in the chan…got a real problem. I'm trying to return some json data to my jquery to populate an html table…I know the php is working properly (as far as I can tell :P) but nothing seems to be getting back to my jquery…can someone please take a look at: http://paste2.org/bKmjsCKF and see what it is that I'm missing?
[22:39:34] <luxgeek> I've been looking at it too long I think :P
[22:45:56] <luxgeek> I guess no one is up to it :P
[22:46:14] <luxgeek> I've been googling my butt off with no joy… :(
[22:46:48] <mfoxdogg|work> luxgeek, use a console.log(data) in the getJSON function to make sure you have the data and its correct
[22:50:52] <luxgeek> mfoxdogg|work: I'll try it, thanks.
[22:52:03] <luxgeek> mfoxdogg|work: Um, exactly how/where would I do that? Since I'm never getting to the alert before the if(data) statment?
[22:54:21] <mfoxdogg|work> oh i see, true without the null
[22:55:04] <mfoxdogg|work> also if that is the case, then its the php not returning anything
[22:55:15] <mfoxdogg|work> or finishing the post for that matter
[22:57:48] <luxgeek> mfoxdogg|work: However, I am able to run that php file directly and use dev tools to see the json data IS getting echoed…thus my perplexion…I was able to capture my json string: My JSON Data is [{"intvID":"8","intvDate":"06-21-2014","intvTime":"13:30","compName":"Technical Company One","contName":"Fred Schmidt","contPh":"555-555-1212"}]
[22:58:22] <luxgeek> mfoxdogg|work: I was able to copy it while I saw it using the dev tool (go google chrome :P )
[23:02:06] <luxgeek> Anyone else with a theory? :D
[23:05:19] <brandonshowers> In Chrome dev tools, does the network tab show a GET request to ‘includes/overview.php’?
[23:05:56] <luxgeek> brandonshowers: Ooh, I never thought to look…I'll go check.
[23:07:52] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: are you able to display anything? like [object][object]?
[23:08:10] <luxgeek> brandonshowers: Yes, it does. That's why I love irc…someone inevitably mentions stuff the brain has forgotten :P
[23:09:24] <luxgeek> In my overview I have it set that if I turn on a specific echo statement I can track the whole script through the while loop and see that I'm getting data etc…so if that's what you mean…
[23:10:17] <jphase> brandonshowers: yeah, it'll show get and post
[23:10:52] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: what is your issue, no json output is being displayed?
[23:10:58] <luxgeek> Never used it before…I've seen it but normally I only ever need the elements tab :P
[23:11:49] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: does that request return a 200 OK?
[23:12:55] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: Yeah, I don't seem to be getting anything back but it's not triggering the alerts in that regard either…heres the code: http://paste2.org/bKmjsCKF  and the json data I can see in dev tools in chrome is: [{"intvID":"8","intvDate":"06-21-2014","intvTime":"13:30","compName":"Technical Company One","contName":"Fred Schmidt","contPh":"555-555-1212"}]  But I only see that data when I'm running the php file rirectly.
[23:13:06] <luxgeek> brandonshowers: Where would I see that?
[23:14:08] <luxgeek> brandonshowers: oh wait, nvm…I see it…and yes it does.
[23:14:57] <jphase> whoops haha, I totally lagged and answered the wrong person - forgive me :x
[23:15:48] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: interesting… out of curiosity, what happens if you change that $.getJSON method to $.ajax (see: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson)
[23:16:13] <brandonshowers> jphase: no worries. I figured as much :)
[23:18:13] <luxgeek> brandonshowers: So I just simply replace the $.getJSON with the $.ajax? Nothing else needs changed or does it? kinda new to this whole getting-mysql-display-with-jquery thing :P )
[23:18:37] <Cork> simpler is most likely to just attach .fail(function() {})
[23:18:44] <Cork> after the $.getJSON call
[23:19:57] <Cork> luxgeek: ^
[23:20:10] <pearo> mfoxdogg|work that was a dumb mistake.... haha thanks. It's still not working though
[23:21:24] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: try something like -> http://pastebin.com/nvKjwX0s for ajax
[23:22:51] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: data ->  parameters being passed to foo.php page
[23:23:13] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: Ok, but I'm not SENDING any data…just retrieving it…the script knows to just use the current users's infor stored in $_SESSION (since the user is logged on…I store all their info )
[23:23:31] <luxgeek> LoneStar99:  So would I just use null for that part?
[23:25:28] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: what happens if you just change line 10 (in the file you shared) to this $.getJSON(url, function(data){
[23:25:48] <Cork> luxgeek: the most likely reason you don't see an alert is cause you get an error and the .fail callback fires
[23:25:51] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: var ins_vendor = '';
[23:25:54] <LoneStar99> would work
[23:25:55] <Cork> but as you don't listen for that you don't see it
[23:25:55] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: also, Cork’s reply was good too
[23:26:25] <luxgeek> And I'm getting these: [{"intvID":"8","intvDate":"06-21-2014","intvTime":"13:30","compName":"Technical Company One","contName":"Fred Schmidt","contPh":"555-555-1212"}]  pieces of data back…(or am SUPPOSED to be) so not sure how the parsejson works…gonna have to look into that.
[23:26:26] <Cork> and ya, don't send null for data
[23:27:02] <Cork> luxgeek: attach the fail callback and see if it fires
[23:27:24] <pearo> Can anyone shed some light as to why changing the background color doesn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/MRmEw/4/ I'm not getting any errors in console so not sure what the problem is
[23:27:28] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: is that json being printed in a div?
[23:27:31] <luxgeek> Cork: Where does that .fail() thing go exactly? I haven't been seeing any data back and I haven't even put htat in yet :P
[23:27:33] <luxgeek> * that
[23:27:45] <Cork> luxgeek: $.getJSON().fail(function() {})
[23:28:01] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: No, the attempt is to ad it to a table tbody kinda thing.
[23:28:21] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: The code is all here: http://paste2.org/bKmjsCKF
[23:28:46] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: Should make it easier for you to see what I'm trying to do :P
[23:28:47] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bf6fe24edd0f379de204
[23:28:53] <luxgeek> Cork: Thanks
[23:29:05] <brandonshowers> that shows the added method Cork is talking about
[23:29:35] <LoneStar99> brandonshowers: well done
[23:29:50] <Cork> pearo: last i looked you don't have color animation in jquery core
[23:30:00] <Cork> jquery ui adds that
[23:30:41] <pearo> Cork Ah. I'll go try that
[23:33:31] <luxgeek> brandonshowers, Cork, LoneStar99: Ok, I got the "something went wrong with the request" message back from the fail func
[23:33:44] <LoneStar99> sweet
[23:34:09] <luxgeek> But that doesn't tell ME how to fix it…(not a noob but not an expert either :P )
[23:34:10] <LoneStar99> luxgeek: good luck hitting the hay
[23:34:24] <luxgeek> LoneStar99: Thanks…I prob will be shortly too
[23:34:30] <Jac0bz1> if i have a string, say "foobar". Is there a way I can select elements that has that string in a spesfied data attribute? like <li data-myattr="something other foobar">..</li>
[23:34:36] <Cork> luxgeek: have you removed the null call?
[23:34:37] <luxgeek> Pick this back up in the am :/
[23:34:46] <Cork> *null in the call
[23:35:13] <luxgeek> In the getJSON call? No, but I can put quotes in there now and try it again.
[23:35:55] <luxgeek> Cork: Nope, still hitting the fail funct
[23:35:59] <luxgeek> Sigh.
[23:36:37] <Cork> luxgeek: andy you get the json in the browsers network tab?
[23:36:58] <Cork> luxgeek: quotes is also wrong
[23:37:11] <Cork> $.getJSON(url, null, function(data){}) should be $.getJSON(url, function(data){})
[23:37:11] <luxgeek> Cork: Just the GET 200/ok part
[23:37:26] <Cork> so no response body?
[23:38:16] <pearo> Cork even with jquery UI, the animation still doesn't work. Unless I'm missing something trivial again...http://jsfiddle.net/MRmEw/6/
[23:39:38] <luxgeek> Cork: Ah, got it…fixing.. and re-tested…if I lok in the network tab->Respnse tab I can SEE the JSON data at the end of my navbar div…
[23:39:58] <Cork> luxgeek: ok
[23:40:03] <luxgeek> Cork: But am still getting the fail msg
[23:40:13] <Cork> then the next step is to take that data and run it through jsonlint
[23:40:21] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[23:40:23] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. → http://jsonlint.com/
[23:40:39] <luxgeek> brandonshowers, Cork: I really appreciate all your help but my eyeballs are burning and drooping so I am forced to have to pick this up in the am…and I'll check that out Cork…thanks. :)
[23:40:46] <Cork> cause if the parser fails to parse (the entire body) you won't get any
[23:42:02] <brandonshowers> luxgeek: Anytime. Good luck and goodnight.
[23:42:32] <Cork> pearo: right your using the shorthand
[23:42:43] <Cork> pearo: you can't animate that
[23:43:07] <Cork> pearo: http://jsfiddle.net/MRmEw/7/
[23:43:47] <pearo> Cork oh... is it better practice to always avoid using the shorthand?
[23:44:07] <Cork> pearo: no, but your passing a specific long hand value to a shorthand
[23:44:23] <Cork> pearo: jquery ui has to parse the value you send
[23:44:32] <Cork> and guess at what you want to do
[23:44:40] <Cork> backgorund is a lot more then just color
[23:44:44] <Cork> so it just isn't supported
[23:45:03] <Cork> pearo: but basically if you want to set one value, set that value
[23:45:16] <Cork> the shorthand in the css is fine
[23:45:29] <Cork> it is the js .animate call that just isn't supported
[23:45:52] <pearo> Cork: ah that makes sense why sometimes the shorthand version doesnt' work properly for me sometimes
[23:46:09] <pearo> thanks! I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for a while now
[23:46:16] <Cork> pearo: also i would recommend checking out css3 animation
[23:46:17] <luxgeek> Cork: You're NOT going to believe this…I fixed it…that Jsonlint did it...
[23:46:23] <Cork> it would solve a lot of these problems
[23:46:38] <Cork> luxgeek: i do believe it
[23:46:44] <Cork> luxgeek: it was the only thing left
[23:47:17] <luxgeek> I saw all this crap in the body (which I noticed before and didn't think anything of) and I was including my header.php files which adds all the css etc…once I removed those lines…BOOM! Validatred :P
[23:47:22] <luxgeek> * Validated
[23:47:36] <Cork> :)
[23:48:14] <Cork> luxgeek: now you can have a good nights sleep with a clean conscience ^^
[23:48:58] <luxgeek> Cork: Thanks a lot for you patience and pointers…I will bid you goodnight and yes, clean concience…it's still isn't DISPLAYING the data but now that I AM getting data back…shouldn't be too much more to sort it :P
[23:49:15] <Cork> yup
[23:49:31] <Cork> you've solved the problem at hand
