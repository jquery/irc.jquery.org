[00:00:12] <crillegustafsson> haha :P good said :P
[00:04:55] <crillegustafsson> woet : http://bloxsolution.se/jSignature/examples/test.html
[00:05:02] <crillegustafsson> so long I got now
[00:05:12] <crillegustafsson> I can write the code
[00:05:34] <crillegustafsson> if I add a button -> I want button to save the signature
[00:05:48] <crillegustafsson> like an image
[00:06:04] <Woet> crillegustafsson: why are you using easyscript?
[00:06:06] <toomus> Woet: still doesn't work. Maybe unbind/bind scroll event on mouseover/mouseleave?
[00:06:16] <Woet> toomus: link your updated fiddle.
[00:06:22] <crillegustafsson> Woet : easyscript ?
[00:06:40] <Woet> crillegustafsson: well, yea, seems like you just copy/pasted http://www.scriptel.com/KeyboardEmulationAPI/JavaScript/tutorial-jSignature.html
[00:06:43] <Woet> for no apparent reason.
[00:07:01] <toomus> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/2rLL4a3f/3/
[00:07:02] <crillegustafsson> yes, that
[00:07:04] <crillegustafsson> ok
[00:07:14] <crillegustafsson> here is the one : http://bloxsolution.se/jSignature/examples/unmini.html
[00:07:38] <crillegustafsson> thats a copy of the original
[00:07:38] <Woet> crillegustafsson: okay, now implement it on your site.
[00:07:49] <crillegustafsson> its done
[00:08:00] <crillegustafsson> how to save that sign ?
[00:08:04] <Woet> crillegustafsson: show me.
[00:08:08] <crillegustafsson> http://bloxsolution.se/jSignature/examples/unmini.html
[00:08:11] <crillegustafsson> thats my sute
[00:08:12] <crillegustafsson> site
[00:08:29] <Woet> crillegustafsson: no, that's the example it includes in the package.
[00:08:39] <Woet> crillegustafsson: i want to see it implemented in your site.
[00:08:50] <crillegustafsson> hmm.. ok
[00:08:57] <Woet> crillegustafsson: stop trying to skip steps.
[00:09:36] <crillegustafsson> woet : im not skipping , :P its not easy
[00:09:56] <Woet> crillegustafsson: you are. you're using 2 HTML files written by someone else
[00:10:00] <Woet> crillegustafsson: that's not implementing.
[00:10:14] <crillegustafsson> oh ok.. u want me to get my own html ?
[00:10:37] <Woet> crillegustafsson: i want you to implement it in the way you actually want it to work.
[00:10:53] <crillegustafsson> yes, im try to do my own html then
[00:12:01] <Woet> toomus: my bad, that doesn't work everywhere. you can try overflow: hidden; on your body
[00:12:51] <Cork> toomus: the only way you can somewhat prevent scrolling is by setting scrollTop in the scroll event on that element
[00:13:02] <Cork> toomus: scroll doesn't bubble so and you can't cancel the event
[00:13:23] <crillegustafsson> woet : http://bloxsolution.se/jSignature/examples/myown.html
[00:13:24] <Cork> setting scrollTop won't work if the user drags the handle though
[00:13:34] <crillegustafsson> woet : thats my own html =)
[00:13:42] <Woet> crillegustafsson: good luck.
[00:13:51] <Cork> basically, scroll is following what the user does primary, and script doesn't have full control
[00:14:14] <crillegustafsson> woet : how do I save the signature to image now ? =)
[00:21:06] <toomus> Woet: set overflow: hidden to body works, but scrollbars disappear, which causing all content to flip
[00:21:22] <Woet> toomus: can you link your site so we can see what you're trying to do?
[00:23:11] <toomus> Woet: sorry, development stage :P
[00:23:26] <Woet> toomus: then i don't know.
[00:28:38] <toomus> Woet: when you toggling body overflow: auto; <=> overflow: hidden;, scrollbars show/hide. I don't know width of scrollbar, but when it is hidden, page content move right. The same situation, when it is visible, page content move left.
[00:43:54] <xaxxon> I'm getting a text file with jquery.ajax and passing it to a functino (webgl) that complains it's not ascii
[00:44:06] <xaxxon> any idea how I might fix that?  (also asking in #webgl)
[00:44:45] <Cork> xaxxon: its most likely unicode
[00:45:03] <Cork> simplest is to fix the encoding server side
[00:45:27] <xaxxon> is there a way to tell on the client side?
[00:46:23] <xaxxon> I know none of the characters themselves are out of the ascii set
[00:47:23] <xaxxon> or mabye I can play with the dataType field
[00:49:47] <xaxxon> or maybe I can run it through some nasty thing that strips off each character and adds it back on to another strin g:(
[01:04:18] <user_corrupt> I’m trying to php echo the following line into my page: http://pastie.org/10183922 and I’m getting the following javascript error as a result: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string <script type='text/javascript'>$('head').append('<link href='/app/canvas/css/blur.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' />');</script>
[01:04:59] <Cork> user_corrupt: context
[01:05:04] <Cork> where are you trying to echo this?
[01:05:39] <user_corrupt> Cork: a php script that is included in my page. Other javascript that gets echoed from there is working fine.
[01:05:56] <Cork> "in your page" isn't exactly specific
[01:09:11] <user_corrupt> Cork: Well, it’s an index.php page with html and and a bunch of other stuff in it.
[01:09:28] <Cork> ...
[01:09:35] <user_corrupt> sorry man
[01:09:43] <user_corrupt> would you like a pastie of the whole thing?
[01:09:46] <Uhkis> well the error is pretty clear
[01:09:51] <Cork> you have a contextual error, form adding something in the wrong place
[01:10:00] <Cork> if you don't share where you add it we can't help you
[01:10:13] <Cork> form==from
[01:10:25] <user_corrupt> oh, I see
[01:10:28] <user_corrupt> one sec
[01:10:51] <Uhkis> user_corrupt: use " for the attributes (as you should)
[01:11:29] <Cork> actually its more complicated that that
[01:11:38] <Cork> you have three level deep quotes
[01:11:42] <Cork> so you have to escape them
[01:12:47] <Uhkis> ooh, didn't open the link
[01:12:52] <Cork> user_corrupt: try http://pastie.org/10183933
[01:13:19] <Cork> ya, i did, but i didn't notice the quote problem
[01:14:08] <Cork> user_corrupt: also, why don't you just add the link in the header directly
[01:14:13] <user_corrupt> Cork: thanks man, that did the trick. I’m gonna take a close look at that and try to understand exactly how you fixes that.
[01:14:16] <Cork> instead of going the round about way over js?
[01:14:43] <user_corrupt> well, I’d like it to be enacted after a certain point
[01:14:50] <user_corrupt> that is determined by the PHP that I have going on
[01:15:09] <Cork> uh
[01:15:13] <Cork> what?
[01:15:19] <user_corrupt> well
[01:15:19] <Cork> user_corrupt: php runs server side
[01:15:27] <Cork> it can't effect client time execution
[01:16:18] <user_corrupt> I have a PHP script that checks if a user has voted in a poll, and then echoes out js to produce a modal window, if they have
[01:16:36] <user_corrupt> I’d like to blur the background out at this point as well, hence the new css
[01:16:39] <Cork> user_corrupt: ok, so again, why not just set the link in head?
[01:16:40] <Cork> directly
[01:16:57] <user_corrupt> sorry, don’t understand
[01:17:18] <crillegustafsson> hi
[01:17:24] <Uhkis> i can mentally see the php script being echo 'all the html'; ;-)
[01:17:33] <Cork> user_corrupt: <head><?php echo "<link href="/app/canvas/css/blur.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />"; ?></head>
[01:17:34] <crillegustafsson> It says  First, include the required PHP file: signature-to-image.php.
[01:17:50] <crillegustafsson> which file should I include this?
[01:18:00] <crillegustafsson> http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-to-image/
[01:18:01] <Cork> crillegustafsson: => ##php
[01:18:10] <Uhkis> Cork: see that's perfect example of failquotes ;)
[01:18:29] <Cork> ya...
[01:18:32] <crillegustafsson> Cork : I dont have access to php
[01:18:35] <Cork> user_corrupt: <head><?php echo '<link href="/app/canvas/css/blur.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />'; ?></head>
[01:18:54] <Cork> crillegustafsson: /ns help register
[01:19:45] <toomus> How to make scrollbar overlay with jQuery?
[01:20:07] <Cork> toomus: that is a tough task to get right
[01:20:13] <Cork> and something you should normally avoid
[01:20:17] <user_corrupt> Cork: what I have is a facebook canvas app where the user votes in a poll, and then after they vote in a poll then they get rediected back to it, and then an included PHP file checks to see if they have voted according to their facebook ID, and then echoes out a modal window
[01:20:35] <user_corrupt> if they have
[01:20:48] <Cork> user_corrupt: i still don't see why you would need js for that
[01:20:57] <user_corrupt> to echo out a modal window?
[01:21:08] <Cork> so echo the modal with php
[01:21:12] <Cork> i don't see why you need js
[01:21:18] <user_corrupt> I dunno
[01:21:24] <user_corrupt> I’m not a very good programmer
[01:21:36] <user_corrupt> you can echo out a modal window with PHP?
[01:22:01] <Cork> you echo the needed html, if you want to use jquery dialog then ya you need js for that
[01:22:09] <Cork> but you don't need js to add the <link> tag in head
[01:22:26] <user_corrupt> well, that’s just to blur out the background
[01:22:34] <Cork> ok?
[01:22:36] <user_corrupt> my site under the modal window
[01:22:55] <Cork> and why does that need to be echoed from php into a js script that all it does is echo that again into the head?
[01:22:59] <Cork> just add it to the head directly
[01:23:25] <user_corrupt> hmmm
[01:24:24] <user_corrupt> don’t follow… I only want it to happen after I have determined that a user has voted… so I have my PHP script echo out the js at that point
[01:24:48] <Cork> so php isn't determening if the voting has happened?
[01:25:04] <user_corrupt> no, it definitely is
[01:25:16] <Cork> then you don't need js there
[01:25:37] <Cork> it feels like your using js cause you don't structure your php correctly
[01:26:01] <Cork> "this file needs to set it up there so lets us js as else i would have to move it and set a variable"
[01:26:08] <user_corrupt> I suppose that is quite possible
[01:26:26] <user_corrupt> was intending to redo the site in a database/template driven way
[01:26:29] <Cork> that is solving a problem with a hack
[01:26:29] <user_corrupt> in like phase II
[01:26:36] <Cork> a really bad hack too
[01:26:43] <user_corrupt> meh
[01:27:01] <toomus> Cork: Maybe you know some easy and nice way to prevent body scrolling on overflow div scroll. Now, to do this I set overflow: hidden to body when mouse is over div, and set back overflow: auto when mouse leave. Scrolling works great, but when I change body overflow property, scrollbar show/hide which make annoying content move effect.
[01:27:15] <Cork> toomus: i answered this ~2h ago
[01:27:33] <toomus> Cork: LoL, really?
[01:31:30] <toomus> Cork: You suggest to set scrollTop on body?
[01:31:52] <Cork> toomus: http://jsfiddle.net/fLseckf4/
[01:32:01] <Cork> firstly what is the problem you're trying to prevent?
[01:32:11] <Cork> the default behavior seems reasonable to me
[01:35:00] <toomus> Cork: first problem is when I scroll div with overflow: scroll, and I get to top or bottom of this div, all page scroll.
[01:35:23] <Cork> toomus: and why is that a problem? (also this is browser specific)
[01:36:50] <toomus> Cork: the easiest way to stop this behavior I found is just set overflow: hidden to body when I want to scroll div. But I mention above, scrollbars problem appear.
[01:38:21] <toomus> Cork: So i think when scrollbar will overlay content, this should resolve my problem
[01:38:36] <Cork> "<Cork> toomus: and why is that a problem? (also this is browser specific)"
[01:39:53] <toomus> Cork: What? Why scrolling all page is problem? It looks poor :P
[01:40:55] <toomus> Cork: In my opinion it is undesirable behavior.
[01:41:09] <Cork> ...
[01:54:37] <crillegustafsson> hi!
[01:54:45] <crillegustafsson> waz up every one?
[01:55:12] <crillegustafsson> I got a signature http://www.bloxsolution.se/signerat/index.html
[01:56:58] <crillegustafsson> when I click submit signature I got a image
[01:57:10] <crillegustafsson> on local it saves over the same image
[01:57:28] <crillegustafsson> but when I put it on my ftp it doesnt saves over the image?
[01:57:43] <crillegustafsson> I have to rename the image output name every time
[02:01:44] <crillegustafsson> Hi again =) need some help please
[02:01:45] <crillegustafsson> :D
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> When I draw my signature and click "submit signature" a images saves called "singature.png"
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> If I draw again and click "submit signature" my images saves as "signature.png" again , which saves over the other one.
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> - thats good!
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> BUT, when I put this online to my website it doesnt write the "signature.png" file over. The old one png file stays on the ftp server.
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> How to make the new image overwrite the old image.
[02:17:28] <crillegustafsson> Like I said, it works on my localhost.
[02:33:48] <M-Maraun> Show the ftp log something? have you clear the webbrowser cache?
[02:35:22] <Tennis> I'm replacing some html in a div with a  backup i have elsewhere on the page but it only seems to work once ?

[02:41:56] <Uhkis> boo!
[02:42:09] <Uhkis> `kickflip
[02:47:17] <basiclaser> can anyone see anything wrong with my jquery.matchheight.js usage here? i just have the three 'matchheight' classes applied to sibling elements, but its not giving them equal heights. It works for me on other pages http://fixee.org/paste/qp4z0sd/
[03:06:09] <Cork> basiclaser: the plugin isn't based on a magic classname
[03:06:22] <Cork> you have to select the elements you want to apply it on and call matchheight
[03:07:30] <BrazenBraden> Now I know this is a mix of RoR and JQuery but I think the problem is on the JQuery side.. I have a form which has multipart: true and has a file upload field. The form is submitted via ajax. If I edit the form without adding an image, the ajax:success gets called fine. However when I add an image, the form saves but the ajax:success is not triggered (I must click the button again to do the ajax:success code). Why?  https://gist.github.com/brazen
[03:07:31] <BrazenBraden> braden/b27ed87db5bb93c389b7
[03:07:48] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/b27ed87db5bb93c389b7
[03:12:30] <basiclaser> Cork: but i defined that classname as the parameter when i called the matchheight function,
[03:12:58] <Cork> basiclaser: and you had the elements in the page when you called it?
[03:13:56] <basiclaser> Cork: yes, im using it just like i do in every other page...
[03:14:47] <op84> hey there - i’m animating a few elements in an iterator and i’m using the complete function of animate… now its not triggered every time? is there a reason for that? its basically like this http://pastie.org/private/cl4nlzrz4x6a6lpjaowxvw
[03:15:52] <Cork> op84: make a fiddle showing the problem
[03:16:07] <Cork> it should work (fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/)
[03:16:28] <Nyterax> hi, how would i get the screen coordinates of the bottom left corner of a selected element?
[03:16:47] <Cork> Nyterax: by taking the top left cordinats + height/width
[03:16:53] <Nyterax> thanks
[03:18:39] <Mr21> Nyterax: yep look the .position and .offset methodes ;)
[03:20:44] <Germanaz0> I have a question, why jquery when you use click event, doesn't use the live method ON internally, webpages are getting more ajaxified, what's the sense of use click and not "on click"
[03:21:43] <Cork> Germanaz0: not sure what you're asking
[03:21:52] <Cork> why jquery doesn't delegate all event handlers to document?
[03:22:06] <Germanaz0> yeah, why .click function doesn't use the live binding
[03:22:21] <Cork> if by "live" you mean .live() that one is removed since 1.9
[03:22:25] <Germanaz0> click is not the same as .on('click'
[03:22:32] <Cork> i is
[03:22:34] <Cork> *it is
[03:22:41] <Nyterax> it is
[03:22:49] <Cork> .click(func) === .on('click', func)
[03:22:50] <Germanaz0> yes I know, but when I mean "live" is like to use .on(click
[03:23:12] <Cork> i don't follow what you mean by live
[03:23:22] <Germanaz0>  Cork: .click(func) === .on('click', func)
[03:23:25] <Germanaz0> exactly that
[03:23:34] <Germanaz0> the thing is that is not the same
[03:23:40] <Cork> they are exactly the same
[03:23:43] <Germanaz0> when you add a dom element to the documet
[03:23:54] <Cork> want me to show you the code where .click links to .on('click' ?
[03:24:15] <Germanaz0> no, I could read by myself :D
[03:24:32] <BrazenBraden> Any idea why my ajax:success doesnt get called when submitting an form with a file field?
[03:24:37] <Cork> Germanaz0: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.click
[03:25:05] <Germanaz0> aw awesome
[03:25:17] <Cork> so ya, again your statement makes no sense
[03:25:56] <Germanaz0> indeed
[03:26:12] <Germanaz0> I saw that it is from versions >= 1.7
[03:26:22] <Germanaz0> in my site I'm using 1.6 xD
[03:26:22] <Nyterax> misguided preconceived notions mess our thinking up
[03:26:25] <Cork> on is new since 1.9
[03:26:34] <Cork> it didn't exist in 1.6
[03:27:10] <Cork> i suspect you're confusing .on with the old deprecated and removed .live
[03:27:16] <Cork> they are not related
[03:27:53] <Cork> Germanaz0: .live was an old quite badly designed api that got replaced by .delegate
[03:28:12] <Cork> the really bad part about .live is that events don't clean up them self
[03:28:22] <Cork> as all events you bind with .live is bound on document
[03:28:36] <Germanaz0> yeah, makes sense
[03:28:45] <Cork> .delegate is similar
[03:29:03] <Cork> with the exception that you can define what element the handler should be delegated to
[03:29:32] <Cork> .on is just a new function in 1.9 where bind + delegate is combined into one function
[03:29:44] <Cork> that you pick the behavior based on the arguments you pass to it
[03:30:09] <Germanaz0> yes
[03:30:31] <Germanaz0> So click should work as on aswell
[03:31:14] <Cork> Germanaz0: live is removed remember
[03:31:21] <Cork> and delegate have a different syntax
[03:31:35] <Germanaz0> ok :D
[03:31:44] <Cork> so no, .click can't behave as delegate cause that wouldn't make any sense
[03:32:02] <Cork> and i would recommend using .delegate instead of .live
[03:32:07] <Cork> as it is removed in later versions
[03:41:51] <BrazenBraden> anyone? :(
[03:42:34] <Germanaz0> BrazenBraden: yes
[03:42:45] <decx> i am one
[03:43:20] * BrazenBraden repastes..
[03:43:28] <BrazenBraden> Now I know this is a mix of RoR and JQuery but I think the problem is on the JQuery side.. I have a form which has multipart: true and has a file upload field. The form is submitted via ajax. If I edit the form without adding an image, the ajax:success gets called fine. However when I add an image, the form saves but the ajax:success is not triggered (I must click the button again to do the ajax:success code). Why?
[03:43:31] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/b27ed87db5bb93c389b7
[03:46:27] <Germanaz0> BrazenBraden: which browser are you ?
[03:47:07] <Germanaz0> don't tell me IE xD
[03:48:06] <Tennis> document.ready appears to be happening more than once
[03:48:11] <Tennis> would onload only occur once?
[03:48:31] <Tennis> I need to set a variable when the user arrives on the page and keep it unchanged until later but its based on one that is subject to change
[03:48:44] <BrazenBraden> Germanaz0, first choice, Chrome, then FF, then Opera.. What is IE? :P
[03:49:16] <Germanaz0> the thing is that when you do ajax uploads, it adds an iframe to do upload
[03:49:49] <Germanaz0> sometimees based on the header that you're sending from the POST it can't parse the data from your success
[03:50:41] <BrazenBraden> Germanaz0, the weird thing is this used to work. I know rails itself cant do ajax file uploads but the remotipart gem makes it so the uploads work with jquery
[03:51:17] <Germanaz0> yes but your server what does return to the success ?
[03:51:20] <Germanaz0> josn, HTML ?
[03:52:08] <BrazenBraden> json
[03:53:38] <Germanaz0> the data is going as HTML
[03:53:43] <Germanaz0> or plain text
[03:53:49] <Germanaz0> check the type of your data
[03:53:59] <Germanaz0> or just do an alert of the begining of success
[03:54:06] <Germanaz0> to check
[03:54:24] <BrazenBraden> Germanaz0, I am sending the data as json
[03:54:45] <BrazenBraden> the alert in the success doesnt get called on first click, only second click
[04:08:56] <FastHelpForJquer> Hi community! i am here gently asking a little help for a very beginner level problem i did not figure in the last 48h .. anyone free the next hour? (it's about an embedded form in a modal dialog)
[04:09:23] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: if you want help, don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[04:11:36] <FastHelpForJquer> Thank you Cork, Ok so my end result should be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/taditdash/vvjj8/ . but instead of " .html("Confirm Dialog Box"); " i should insert an entire <div> with a form .. and i would like to avoid escaping functions (that would mean variables to manage and i'm not confortable in Jquery)
[04:12:47] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: simplest would be to just keep the html in a hidden element
[04:13:01] <FastHelpForJquer> What would you suggest me to do to : insert a perfectly fine embedded form (in jquery) in a html page , that should appear in modal mode only AFTER the click of a eg:button ?
[04:13:05] <Cork> or possibly in a <script type="text/template"<</script> tag
[04:13:38] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: so make the #dialog-confirm into #dialog-confirm-template"
[04:14:06] <Cork> and do $('#dialog-confirm-template').clone().attr('id', 'dialog-confirm').dialog()
[04:14:11] <FastHelpForJquer> Thanks cork , so staying with the first option you propose ,
[04:14:31] <Cork> that would be the last example i gave you :)
[04:14:42] <phpcoder> HELLO EVERYBODY
[04:14:43] <FastHelpForJquer> (thanks you're really fast i'm from italy sorry i'm kind of slow and i have to elaborate, please be patient)
[04:14:49] <phpcoder> ops pardon caps :)
[04:14:55] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: just remember to make the -template display: none
[04:15:29] <Nyterax> GOOD DAY TO YOU TOO PHPCODER
[04:15:36] <phpcoder> Nyterax, :)
[04:16:15] <Nyterax> at work we each have our own office and just leave the doors open and yell out our questions and anyone competent can yell back an answer or explanation
[04:16:27] <Uhkis> :D
[04:16:49] <Nyterax> screw slack, skype and all that crap
[04:16:54] <Nyterax> yelling is awesome
[04:17:08] <Uhkis> laughing pretty hard here imagining that :D
[04:18:34] <FastHelpForJquer> @Cork i'm slowing trying to implement your fist suggestion here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6627/  (PS: i will leave in about 10mins and be back before 2hours BTW)
[04:19:41] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: line 5 should use .dialog from line 9
[04:19:45] <phpcoder> guys i need to find a way to organize my .js file better...i have a file called assessments.js that i can use in different page..... these pages have specific content (box) that i need to load using AJAX. Looking at my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/957eb46bc7f8c20a6fc1       it seems NOT DRY at all... basically i would like to do something like:          <div something="load-agent"></div> and load the content automatical
[04:19:45] <phpcoder> ly
[04:19:56] <phpcoder> do i have to use a specific library..
[04:19:56] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: and the content you want in it should replace <div id="dialog-confirm"></div>
[04:19:57] <phpcoder> ?
[04:20:15] <basiclaser> is there a jquery method for togging disabled attribute on an element
[04:22:40] <decx> disabled is a property
[04:22:45] <Terminus> phpcoder: sounds like you need to restructure your code then so you can do $('div.load
[04:22:52] <decx> and as such element.prop('disabled', true)
[04:23:04] <Terminus> phpcoder: sounds like you need to restructure your code then so you can do $('div.load-agent')... whenever the page loads.
[04:23:33] <phpcoder> Terminus, exactly
[04:23:35] <phpcoder> how can i do that?
[04:24:14] <Terminus> phpcoder: well, you need to write that. =P
[04:24:24] <phpcoder> Terminus, basically i can call this content in different pages and then when i load the cotnent i also need to add eevnts (manage submit because all those content has forms)
[04:24:43] <phpcoder> Terminus, yes but how to call like you said $('div.)
[04:24:47] <phpcoder> can you give me an example?
[04:24:51] <FastHelpForJquer> Thanks Cork , i'm trying to get at your point http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6628/ (Again NOTE i will leave in about 5mins and be back before 2hours BTW)
[04:25:49] <Terminus> phpcoder: one idea i'd toy with is to have the id encoded in the response so JS will insert the content wherever appropriate instead of having hardcoded if ($('#agent_profile').length)...
[04:26:04] <Terminus> phpcoder: well, wouldn't that just be an appendChild()?
[04:26:20] <FastHelpForJquer> Jsfiddle before advise me not to link sources directly from the html frame . What would you suggest me? To work in locale or to manually add the reference to jsfiddle?
[04:26:55] <Terminus> phpcoder: nevermind the id idea. it's the other way around.
[04:27:36] <Terminus> phpcoder: check the ids of all load-agent classes and then use the id as a parameter for the data you need to get.
[04:28:15] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6629/
[04:29:18] <FastHelpForJquer> #Cork thanks again ( we seen you after)
[04:32:54] <krambiorix> hi, what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/byccbudq/
[04:33:06] <Terminus> phpcoder: if it's not clear enough, the idea is to have the id become a parameter of the request so that if an element with such an id exists, it is fetched and appended.
[04:34:52] <phpcoder> Terminus, back.... i am reading
[04:35:50] <Uhkis> krambiorix: a) you paste a link without asking b) your link doesn't have any jquery in it c) probably something else too
[04:36:31] <Uhkis> *asking a real question
[04:37:07] <Xoro> $(#container).add($p1); is the appropriate syntax for adding a jQuery object as an element into a parent right?
[04:37:23] <Cork> Xoro: no
[04:37:37] <phpcoder> Terminus, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/957eb46bc7f8c20a6fc1#file-gistfile1-js-L143
[04:37:44] <phpcoder> i check if the class exists
[04:37:48] <Cork> .add creates a new collection based on the elements in $() plus the one in $p1
[04:38:02] <Cork> Xoro: it doesn't modify the dom at all
[04:38:06] <Xoro> So I should use .html?
[04:38:13] <Cork> .append
[04:38:17] <Cork> or .prepend
[04:38:37] <Cork> or ya .html if you want to replace the content
[04:38:43] <Terminus> phpcoder: what i'm suggesting really is a big refactor of your code if you want it DRY.
[04:39:51] <Terminus> phpcoder: the idea being you don't have separate functions for each load, you just have one where a parameter is passed and the appropriate data is retrieved.
[04:40:52] <phpcoder> Terminus, ok but i need to check somewhere if i need to do the ajax call or not?
[04:40:57] <phpcoder> right?
[04:41:09] <phpcoder> i mean...basically if a div exists i understant that i need to do a ajax call
[04:41:35] <Terminus> phpcoder: that's why i mentioned you have a class for all elements that need to be loaded via ajax. you iterate over all elements with that class, get their id, pass the id as a parameter to the request.
[04:43:40] <Terminus> phpcoder: kinda like $(function() { $('div.load-agent').each(function() { ... }) });
[04:44:02] <phpcoder> Terminus, the problem is that i need to use different pages
[04:44:05] <phpcoder> look at URL
[04:44:08] <phpcoder> is not the same
[04:44:14] <Binx> Is there a way to see how many values are populated in an array of input objects without iterating?
[04:44:15] <phpcoder> ajax request are poiting to different locations
[04:44:38] <Terminus> phpcoder: errr, $(function() { $('div.load-agent').each(function(i, e) { ... }) });
[04:44:49] <Terminus> phpcoder: you have an agent id. pass that too?
[04:45:09] <Cork> Binx: .length?
[04:45:12] <phpcoder> Terminus, not always
[04:45:25] <phpcoder> i mean i should use a data "attribute"
[04:45:29] <Cork> Binx: or what do you mean populated?
[04:45:34] <phpcoder> to set the id i shoul duse in that ajax request
[04:45:44] <phpcoder> Terminus, but i also have a different url
[04:45:48] <Terminus> phpcoder: actually, yes you should use a data attr.
[04:46:09] <Binx> Cork: say I have 6 input fields, I want to check if all have values without having to iterate through them. they all belong to the same class attr
[04:46:23] <Cork> Binx: you can't
[04:46:28] <phpcoder> so should i do something like:            <div class="my-class"  url="/url/ajax_edit_profile" data="1"></div> ?
[04:46:38] <Binx> Cork: figured as much, thanks for advising
[04:46:47] <Cork> Binx: also you don't have to be afraid of itterations
[04:46:50] <Cork> its quite fast in js
[04:46:58] <Terminus> phpcoder: spelling it out, $.get("/recruiters/assessments/" + type + "/" + String(agent_id), ...).
[04:47:13] <Binx> Cork: yeh true, hah more lazy and on deadline, oh well
[04:47:34] <Cork> Binx: just do if($().filter(function(){ return $(this).val().length > 0; }).length > 0) {}
[04:47:37] <phpcoder> Terminus, yes ok but i need to pass the "type"
[04:47:43] <phpcoder> in a div attribute
[04:47:44] <phpcoder> no?
[04:47:59] <Binx> Cork: thanks ill try it now
[04:48:23] <Terminus> phpcoder: specifying individual absolute paths in elements is too cumbersome IMO. specify a root path which is used to generate request urls.
[04:48:42] <Terminus> phpcoder: yeah, the data used in the request has to come from somewhere.
[04:54:37] <Binx> Cork: thanks thats worked great
[04:54:52] <Binx> Cork: filter is good, ill use it more
[04:55:01] <Cork> ya, it's nice
[04:55:06] <phpcoder> Terminus, ok i specify the root url so i only pass the page
[04:55:21] <phpcoder> Terminus, last thing...
[04:55:33] <phpcoder> as i told you those content has FORM
[04:55:39] <phpcoder> so i should add event on submit
[04:55:42] <phpcoder> how can i do that?
[05:08:18] <Terminus> phpcoder: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:09:01] <phpcoder> Terminus, ok
[05:38:49] <DarsVaeda> why does the sortable still contain the removed element? http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/
[05:39:01] <DarsVaeda> when you drag from right to left the array is correct
[05:39:36] <DarsVaeda> but dragging an element from left to right the removed element is still in the array, it seems all the events fire before the element is removed
[05:41:16] <DarsVaeda> it would be MUCH easier just to monitor changes to the sortable though
[05:46:21] <doug16k_> DarsVaeda, there is a change event, http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-change
[05:48:16] <DarsVaeda> this works partially, it still has all items but one is empty
[05:48:48] <DarsVaeda> and not all the time btw
[05:59:51] <DarsVaeda> hmm its something related to my receive event function
[06:05:24] <Tennis> I have something called 'sarray'
[06:05:31] <Tennis> that will be changing throughout use
[06:05:46] <Tennis> i want to keep a back up of how it was when the page loaded so the user can cancel
[06:06:07] <Tennis> but whereever i put resetSarray = sarray it keeps updating whenever sarray does
[06:06:30] <Cork> Tennis: objects (and arrays) are referenced, not copied
[06:06:47] <Cork> so you have to loop the value and add it to a new array to clone it
[06:06:55] <Cork> (or use $.extend)
[06:07:07] <T13|needsCoffee> Is it possible to create a pure JavaScript IRC client that I can embed into a webpage with jQuery?
[06:07:31] <T13|needsCoffee> Like a "live help" feature.
[06:07:45] <Cork> Tennis: var resetSarray = $.extend([], sarray);
[06:08:07] <decx> mibbit and kiwiirc have embeds that you can use
[06:08:12] <Tennis> Thanks dude, let my try that. just look at the api docs for extend()
[06:08:14] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: no, you would have to have a server support
[06:08:22] <Tennis> s/looking
[06:08:23] <decx> and many ticketsystems have livehelp stuff built in now with their own embed
[06:08:24] <Cork>  +it
[06:08:30] <T13|needsCoffee> Cork: thanks.
[06:08:44] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: now days all the server would need is websocket support though
[06:09:02] <Cork> and some actually provide that support
[06:10:04] <Tennis> Thats done it thanks alot, your are doing gods work
[06:10:29] <FastHelpForJquer> #Cork I really thank you Cork, I have seen you added the External Resources in Jsfiddle External resources and that you moved the CSS in the right place. Anyway after clicking on “OpenConfirm Dialog” of your http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6629/ , nothing seem to appear (instead of the original http://jsfiddle.net/taditdash/vvjj8/) .
[06:10:33] <T13|needsCoffee> I want to have an embedable JavaScript template on ddowiki.com that will render freenode##DDOwiki channel and give some basic information on join like what page of the wiki they are on.
[06:10:51] <FastHelpForJquer> @Cork : My end point , BTW, is to have the result that is in this page http://www.comune.cittadella.pd.it/ after you click the yellow banner “comunic@re” (search in the page that word) , into this test page http://www.vedelago.gov.it/TestNewsletter.html , where i can add an HTML paragraph and ADD whatever I want but i cannot delete other .JS present on that test page.
[06:11:29] <T13|needsCoffee> It would auto set their nick to their wiki username if possible or give that information on join as well.
[06:13:22] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: ya, something in you're code is forcing display: none on the content in the dialog
[06:13:46] <T13|needsCoffee> I know there are mediawiki extensions for irc? But I don't host the wiki so can't get it installed.
[06:14:06] <Cork> FastHelpForJquer: the content is there but #mc_embed_signup, #mc-embedded-subscribe-form { display: none !important; } is hiding it
[06:14:38] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: what you can show depends on what the server provides you
[06:14:49] <Cork> so you would have to look into server clients
[06:15:31] <T13|needsCoffee> I know how to access the info from the wiki side.
[06:16:03] <T13|needsCoffee> Just need to figure out how to put together the irc interface and communicate with the irc server.
[06:16:18] <Cork> that is what i meant
[06:16:27] <Cork> you can't connect directly from js to irc
[06:16:33] <Cork> at least not to freenode
[06:16:48] <Cork> you have to connect through a server that proxies the irc information
[06:18:04] <T13|needsCoffee> Hrmm. So, I'd basically have to build a js interface for an api for a bot to proxy messages.  I actually think I could do that...
[06:21:31] <DarsVaeda> I found the reason for my problem...http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/1/
[06:21:43] <DarsVaeda> seems the element is not really removed from the sortable
[06:21:57] <DarsVaeda> but I don't see any "unlink" method?
[06:22:58] <notchris> DarsVaeda: detach?
[06:23:12] <notchris> Should keep the elements information
[06:24:17] <notchris> Seems to work
[06:24:45] <decx> why remove elements for the available source at all?
[06:25:30] <DarsVaeda> for who?
[06:25:53] <DarsVaeda> you should be able to drag elements over just once
[06:25:57] <DarsVaeda> its a bucket
[06:27:02] <jrizzle88> does anyone know of a library that i can sort tables that output like this http://jsbin.com/varutiboji/1/edit?html  ....
[06:28:04] <DarsVaeda> decx, doesn't work for me :(
[06:28:12] <DarsVaeda> where did you detach?
[06:28:19] <DarsVaeda> oh sorry meant notchris
[06:28:41] <notchris> DarsVaeda: What doesn’t work?
[06:28:45] <notchris> Dragging items over?
[06:28:46] <decx> i mean why remove items from "verfügbar"
[06:29:04] <decx> should fade to grey or something
[06:29:11] <DarsVaeda> it is a bucket, you should only be able to ...
[06:29:40] <DarsVaeda> ah no they should disappear
[06:30:14] <DarsVaeda> emphasize "that's what you got"
[06:30:15] <notchris> Yeah it works
[06:30:22] <notchris> On Chrome
[06:30:32] <notchris> I changed .remove() to .detach()
[06:30:47] <notchris> Not sure it makes a diff
[06:30:58] <DarsVaeda> that's the other direction
[06:31:15] <DarsVaeda> left to right doesn't work
[06:31:21] <DarsVaeda> look at the console output
[06:36:42] <DarsVaeda> this is funny too: http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/2/
[06:36:54] <DarsVaeda> why does it suddenly float around ^^
[06:38:03] <decx> why not have 2 sortable lists instead?
[06:38:17] <decx> wouldnt that do all that without all the droppable and draggable stuff
[06:38:19] <DarsVaeda> I failed to make the right one not sortable
[06:38:33] <DarsVaeda> it should just be a list
[06:40:17] <decx> let's see
[06:40:55] <DarsVaeda> my old solution is to monitor the drop event of the droppable and the sortable update
[06:42:00] <DarsVaeda> but then of course handle elements individually
[06:45:20] <BillCriswell> I'm confused. What's happening?
[06:45:37] <Tennis> am i doing this wrong?
[06:45:38] <Tennis> role = $("roleText").text;
[06:45:43] <Tennis> its returning function(e)
[06:45:57] <BillCriswell> Tennis: You need ()
[06:46:00] <BillCriswell> after .text
[06:46:02] <Tennis> thanks
[06:46:12] <DarsVaeda> BillCriswell, talking about my problem?
[06:46:14] <Tennis> I should no better ive made that mistake 3 times in the last few days
[06:46:43] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Happens.
[06:49:25] <Tennis> interesting its working correctly for the one one i don't want dynamically updated
[06:49:37] <Tennis> without the ()
[06:49:58] <Tennis> oh but then it might be becoming that function
[06:52:05] <notchris> If I have a very messy table that I’m trying to pull content from but have to leave a good portion of it intact, what is the best option?
[06:52:14] <notchris> I’m trying to unwrap different parts
[06:52:26] <decx> DarsVaeda: i thought .sortable('cancel') would do the trick but apparently that's bugged :(
[06:52:50] <DarsVaeda> I'm almost about to say it won't work
[06:53:00] <DarsVaeda> although http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/2/ is really close
[06:53:02] <notchris> Basically, how can I replicate “display:none’ or ‘visibility:hidden’ or .remove() / .detach()
[06:53:03] <decx> it'll work
[06:53:07] <decx> but not as easy as it could
[06:53:10] <notchris> Without disturbing the element
[06:53:21] <notchris> Every method appears to disturb the script associated with this table
[06:53:37] <notchris> I’m wondering if setting the width and height to 1px is a usable hack
[06:53:37] <DarsVaeda> decx, my old solution reloads the list on the droppable.drop but that destroys usability quite a bit
[06:54:03] <decx> DarsVaeda: yeah my test is killing itself when trying to move one from the bucket ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/wggcrnLg/3/
[06:54:57] <decx> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6954
[06:55:08] <decx> changed 2 years ago
[06:55:15] <decx> more funding needed
[07:00:56] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/4/
[07:01:03] <DarsVaeda> this very hacking feeling thing works
[07:01:11] <DarsVaeda> hacky?
[07:01:17] <DarsVaeda> is that a word? ^^
[07:01:23] <decx> i used it before
[07:01:37] <decx> although i prefer fucky
[07:01:59] <DarsVaeda> I clone the element there and remove the original then change the display and position of the clone :/
[07:02:08] <FastHelpForJquer> @Cork - hi again - i doubled checked your last answer (even if how you came up to that is behind my comprehension right now, that's why i will have continue studying surely)
[07:03:07] <decx> yeah but if it works it works right ;)
[07:03:16] <DarsVaeda> somehow ^^
[07:03:48] <decx> i've been to draggable sortable droppable hell myself and it always ends up like that haha
[07:03:54] <DarsVaeda> are you firm with the jquery internals?
[07:04:47] <FastHelpForJquer> but , i've update your last jsfiddle with comments starting with "<!-- H1550" visible here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6634/ ( may I ask if you accept BTC for a coffe reward?) thanks in advance, it's important for me to arrive at the end point i wrote before by the end of this night =)
[07:07:12] <DarsVaeda> decx, yeah the last time I did this was hell too
[07:07:42] <decx> your hack still feels good from a user standpoint so i wouldnt worry too much
[07:08:03] <stalkr_> Hi, anyone know why my ajax calls the error callback even though it was successful (status == 200)? I have this http://git.io/vUgxp but I get this 'Error: 200 Event executed: true'
[07:08:04] <DarsVaeda> I guess actually I would have to destroy the draggable on the drop event because the element still is connected to the sortable
[07:09:33] <DarsVaeda> but can't do it there because "Error: cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destory'"
[07:09:35] <Cork> stalkr_: check the third argument to the error callback
[07:10:56] <stalkr_> Cork: Removing   dataType: 'json'   worked, seems the problem was I expected JSON but I just got a string back
[07:11:19] <stalkr_> Works fine now
[07:16:48] <VanReyes> Hi everyone, I have an issue. I have a textbox, I want to input anything on there, and before saving. I will click on the other page. But my problem is the text I've inputted is lost. I want to have something an auto-save, it is possible in jquery/ajax?
[07:17:18] <Cork> VanReyes: check into indexeddb
[07:17:26] <Cork> or possibly localstorage
[07:17:49] <Cork> (you should be careful with the later one if it gets to be a lot of data)
[07:18:41] <VanReyes> Thanks Cork.
[07:19:41] <DarsVaeda> decx, still buggy... neverending story ^^
[07:21:56] <notchris> How do I hide content once it has been appended
[07:22:08] <notchris> In example, I’m trying to hide a TR inside of an appended table
[07:22:17] <notchris> I can reference it the same way once it has been appended
[07:22:21] <decx> hide before you append
[07:22:31] <notchris> Tried, can’t select it correctly
[07:22:36] <decx> sure you can
[07:22:38] <notchris> Because it’s content pulled from an ajax request
[07:22:43] <decx> doesnt matter
[07:22:48] <notchris> It’s not responding to my selector
[07:22:54] <notchris> And I’ve matched it in the browser console
[07:22:56] <notchris> It should be working fine
[07:23:07] <decx> fiddle up
[07:23:10] <notchris> Will do
[07:23:29] <notchris> Actually, the script may not work in a fiddle
[07:23:35] <notchris> Cant I link you to live example?
[07:23:39] <notchris> Can*
[07:23:56] <notchris> It uses CORS
[07:24:03] <notchris> https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/tickets-peo/
[07:24:28] <notchris> Once a date is selected
[07:24:33] <notchris> It loads a bad looking table
[07:24:41] <notchris> I want to remove the first two tbody instances
[07:24:49] <notchris> However, nth-child, and lt(2) wont work
[07:25:09] <notchris> In the console however, works fine
[07:25:14] <crillegustafsson> Hi, when Im uploading my singature-pad to server I get --> $('.sigPad').signaturePad(options);
[07:25:27] <crillegustafsson> error
[07:25:47] <decx> in your success you can put your response into a var stuff = $(data); then pull your table from that, change visibility and after that you can append
[07:25:57] <notchris> decx: Good call
[07:26:23] <decx> ie var mytable = stuff.find('table')
[07:26:39] <decx> and then mytable.find(':nthchildwhatever').hide()
[07:26:44] <decx> and then append(mytable)
[07:27:42] <notchris> Weird, still no luck
[07:27:47] <notchris> I’ll try some other methods
[07:28:31] <FastHelpForJquer> Cork: hi Cork , sorry for pressing , may I ask if you read my lasts messages at 16:04 ? ty
[07:44:05] <ipwa> I’m setting a cookie expiery date like this: getDate() + 5 * 365, after how long will the cookie expire
[07:49:01] <FastHelpForJquer> Cork: @Cork I think the objective is near as , while forking the project (that you helped me correcting) i saw the form http://i62.tinypic.com/2wokabs.png ! so do you think now the problem is about another JS interfering ? But why doesn't the modal form appear once the button clicked but just happened 1 time randomly on Jsfiddle? (thanks for your patience Cork)
[08:08:54] <maxvi> anybody know how how can I get data-* attributes from the select element when I use dropkick library to draw this element ?
[08:11:04] <FastHelpForJquer> #Cork hi again, I know it's just passed only about 2h, but could  you will answer (even negatively) and maybe have a tip about another irc more appropriate (eg: if it's a JS problem not dependent on JQuery..),
[08:17:01] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: try again tomorrow, he usually isnt here on evenings
[08:25:31] <FastHelpForJquer> Uhkis: thank you Uhkis , but -that's my own- this thing "is"/should be for tomorrow, so I'll be still reading docs & examples to figuring out by myself till night but don't know if i succeed.. Would you mind share 10mins too for this question? If you answer yes i will summarize for you (if you didn't read the irc history)
[08:27:52] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: my eyes see drupal, why not https://www.drupal.org/project/modal_forms ?
[08:29:32] <FastHelpForJquer>  Uhkis: thanks Uhkis, but i must stay (stuck) with Magnolia CMS (see my test page i wrote before) .. if there was bootstrap or other i should have ended yesterday with apposite classes to do this! =/
[08:29:49] <laravel23414> Hi
[08:29:51] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: so what's your latest fiddle?
[08:30:13] <laravel23414> I got two jquery to load who dont work good together
[08:30:32] <laravel23414> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:30:34] <laravel23414> and
[08:30:47] <laravel23414> <script src="../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:30:55] <laravel23414> I need both
[08:31:11] <laravel23414> but site doesnt work with them togheter :S
[08:33:41] <Siphion> Hi
[08:34:32] <FastHelpForJquer> Uhkis: after the helpful Cork adds, i added comments with "<!-- H1550" visible here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6634/  but now I am working here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6628/ . This last Jsfiddle seems now work oppositly what i want: now after the form is visible and after click disappeaer. I want that onpageload is not visible, and on buttonclick the entire form appear in modal  . Tu Uhkis if you at least could give me tips 
[08:37:04] <Siphion> http://jsfiddle.net/Siphion/zdbre42L/3/ $.map question. I was expecting the same output for method1 and method2 but i could only get the output desired with $.map using the method3. Is this a correct behaviour?
[08:37:32] <Siphion> can*
[08:37:56] <robertmaxrees> columns.map(function(e) { isn't appropriate here.
[08:38:39] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.map (the first one you're using) is meant for jquery objects, so you won't get the right output there.
[08:39:08] <robertmaxrees> so you want $.map();
[08:39:15] <Siphion> robertmaxrees: no, it's not https://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[08:39:45] <robertmaxrees> ah sorry, columns.map is the native version. my bad.
[08:40:49] <Siphion> yes, columns.map is the native version and $.map is the jquery version for Array and Objects.
[08:40:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[08:40:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[08:40:58] <robertmaxrees> just rolled into work ;)
[08:41:22] <arthurvr> serge: Somebody here will hopefully be happy to answer your support questions :) #jquery-content isn’t meant for support.
[08:41:30] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: so when you load the page, you want that form in a modal?
[08:41:43] <serge> arthurvr: it's okay I figured it out
[08:42:00] <arthurvr> that was quick serge :)
[08:42:34] <Siphion> robertmaxrees :) do you think that is correct that the method 2 should output [1, 1] instead of [[1],[1]] ?
[08:42:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking.
[08:42:50] <Siphion> it's strange
[08:45:17] <FastHelpForJquer> Uhkis: No, I want that onpageload the form is not visible (only the button => that i will change in a clickable div later) , and only after clicking on buttonclick the entire form appear in modal
[08:46:05] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6638/ like this?
[08:47:33] <robertmaxrees> Siphion interesting.  jquery flattens the array: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y4Lvf7oy/
[08:47:36] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.  wonder why.
[08:47:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/#jQuery-map-array-callback
[08:48:02] <robertmaxrees> even documented that way.
[08:48:43] <FastHelpForJquer> Uhkis: BIG HUG great Uhkis! That's the perfectly right starting point for me ! (what did you change) now I get because you and Cork appear with red names, because you are great guys!
[08:50:26] <effortDee> i have a search form which has on click that works but it wont work when on submit for some reason, i can press enter that is fine, but i can't click and it isn't
[08:50:28] <Uhkis> FastHelpForJquer: i hid the original form and cloned that as the modal (that's not even necessary) then i moved the inline javascript includes to external resources to avoid any fiddle conflicts
[08:50:40] <Siphion> wonderful
[08:50:49] <Siphion> thank you robertmaxrees!
[08:50:52] <FastHelpForJquer> (var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true); ) so were interfernce problems with other js , right?
[08:51:23] <FastHelpForJquer> Uhkis: sorry unread the last, i read later
[08:51:35] <robertmaxrees> effortDee submit is for form elements, not input elements.
[08:54:23] <effortDee> ah
[08:54:27] <effortDee> ok robertmaxrees
[08:55:03] <balls-> jQuery('.parent').mouseenter(function() {
[08:55:04] <balls->  jQuery('this > .nav-child').show();
[08:55:04] <balls->  });
[08:55:04] <Siphion> i didn't check if it was precisely documented, i was like "why?! it's not correct"! thank you again robertmaxrees! :)
[08:55:13] <balls-> sorry, meant to write in one line
[08:55:34] <balls-> how do i do i fix that second selector to do what i´m clearly trying to do?
[08:56:06] <robertmaxrees> balls- jQuery(this).children('.nav-child').show()
[08:56:18] <balls-> thank you <3
[08:56:58] <decx> put your code in a block so you dont have to write jQuery all the time
[08:57:38] <robertmaxrees> that too.  (function($) { /* your code here */ }(jQuery));
[08:57:56] <balls-> i use another library that steals the $
[08:58:14] <robertmaxrees> right ^ wrap your code in what i just shared and it'll work with $ again
[08:58:32] <balls-> also my boss demands i do it this way
[08:58:36] <robertmaxrees> and/or use noConflict to let you choose another shortcut.
[08:58:56] <robertmaxrees> wait so you can't wrap your code in an IIFE to make things easier?
[08:59:29] <decx> if you can write jQuery you can write the wrapper that deals with it
[08:59:42] <balls-> he prefers this way, makes it easier to spot jquery lines or something
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[08:59:55] <decx> run
[08:59:57] <robertmaxrees> your boss hates programmers.  that sucks.
[09:00:02] <balls-> i know
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> wait don't tell me the other lib is mootools.
[09:00:13] <balls-> also i have to use joomla for backend in every. single. project.
[09:00:36] <balls-> so yeah, mootools
[09:00:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[09:00:45] <balls-> fml
[09:00:54] <robertmaxrees> i did an abatement project here a long time ago for that.
[09:01:01] <robertmaxrees> it's worth the investment in time and resources.
[09:02:33] <balls-> yeah, no
[09:03:18] <balls-> i´m just doing what i have to do to pay the bills while setting up my own start up using fancy buzzword technologies you know
[09:03:38] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing nothing to fix it for the next poor schmuck who comes along? ;)
[09:03:47] <balls-> hell naw
[09:05:52] <robertmaxrees> that's too bad.
[09:06:20] <decx> mootools and joomla huh
[09:06:38] <decx> well not killing yourself is the first right step then
[09:06:39] <balls-> i´m doing nothing so the next poor schmuck can be inspired to start his own company without all the bullshit
[09:06:48] <balls-> we need more jobs
[09:07:05] <robertmaxrees> balls- heh i work at a company that uses coldfusion - doesn't mean i can't make some things better.
[09:08:10] <decx> yo btw robertmaxrees i see that build doesnt have tocart buttons, do you have some data about that?
[09:08:19] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[09:08:22] <decx> i want to get rid of tocart buttons from a client
[09:08:28] <robertmaxrees> "tocart"?
[09:08:40] <decx> they dont put the product to the cart anyway
[09:08:52] <decx> they want them as "cta"
[09:08:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?  we have add to cart buttons.
[09:09:08] <decx> i dont see any
[09:09:18] <robertmaxrees> on our product pages.
[09:09:25] <decx> i mean on lists
[09:09:30] <robertmaxrees> oh searches you mean?
[09:09:36] <decx> yeah and categories
[09:09:50] <robertmaxrees> it's because a lot of our products need configuration before they can go into the cart.
[09:09:51] <decx> a product page without a to cart button would be weird indeed :D
[09:09:57] <robertmaxrees> it's... a more compelx problem than that
[09:10:12] <decx> yeah same on that clients shop
[09:10:24] <decx> they have a designer that thinks they serve as call to action
[09:10:34] <decx> so you press to cart and you land on the product page
[09:10:37] <decx> to me that's asinine
[09:10:42] <robertmaxrees> that's totally asinine.
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> the product itself is the CTA.
[09:10:51] <decx> the image is all the cta i need in a list
[09:10:52] <decx> yeah
[09:11:16] <robertmaxrees> we don't have any data, but baymard seems like really like our search.
[09:11:49] <decx> now they want an AB Test with buttons and without ^^
[09:11:53] <robertmaxrees> good.
[09:12:06] <decx> more hours
[09:12:10] <decx> whatevs
[09:12:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, in our case we want a way to add direct-to-cart from our search pages (which are the same as category pages basically), but that experience would need to be frictionless.
[09:13:44] <decx> it rarely is with variants and sizes
[09:14:23] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not the real problem - http://www.build.com/delta-t17253-shower-faucet/s720176?uid=1520108
[09:14:25] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[09:14:36] <robertmaxrees> select a finish, add to cart.  see the next page?
[09:15:01] <decx> oh wow
[09:15:08] <robertmaxrees> THAT'S our problem.
[09:16:24] <robertmaxrees> we do that so you don't shoot yourself in the foot when buying complicated stuff.  other companies tend to just sort of let you screw things up and waste time.
[09:16:32] <robertmaxrees> not an idea flow necessarily, but we have a low return rate because of it.
[09:17:27] <DarsVaeda> I try to create a dialog in jquery 1.10 + jqueryui 1.11.4 but that also creates an overlay that blocks everything (in the dialog too), that was not the case in prior versions
[09:17:33] <DarsVaeda> how do I get rid of that overlay?
[09:17:46] <robertmaxrees> use css to hide it?
[09:18:36] <robertmaxrees> or set modal to false.
[09:20:51] <DarsVaeda> nope set modal to false doesn't work
[09:21:03] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you're seeing then?
[09:21:27] <DarsVaeda> decx, but at least upgrading jqueryui fixed my problem, still have to use the hacky version though
[09:23:13] <decx> nice
[09:25:48] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/wr7jskct/1/
[09:26:21] <robertmaxrees> how do i trigger the modal?
[09:38:15] <DarsVaeda> ah my bad we used an old css version for the ui theme -.-
[09:39:41] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it :)
[09:47:49] <Pymous> Hello !
[09:49:11] <Pymous> I've got a small issue, I have a snippet who add an hidden input, the script is working (if I change hidden to type="text", I can see the input), but it's not taken in the request ($_POST["myInput"]) is'nt defined
[09:52:17] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Pymous
[09:52:36] <robertmaxrees> ugh b-ot :( Pymous can you share your code in a fiddle?
[09:52:39] <Pymous> It's a simple form, and the snippet is quite easy, let me paste you
[09:55:28] <Pymous> robertmaxrees : http://pastebin.com/KCNRSaEE
[09:56:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry, could you narrow this down to just the relevant bits?
[09:56:45] <Pymous> ofc
[09:56:58] <robertmaxrees> and pop it into something like http://jsfiddle.net/ instead?
[09:58:24] <Pymous> robertmaxrees : http://pastebin.com/tgf32msE
[09:58:41] <robertmaxrees> that says it's a private paste...
[09:59:12] <Pymous> robertmaxrees : Sorry, thought you had an account
[09:59:13] <Pymous> http://pastebin.com/xwpawmL8
[10:00:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the value of input supposed to be?
[10:00:45] <Pymous> robertmaxrees : I use .InputTags to add tags to .TagsPool, with the JS part, I do see the text input being added
[10:00:49] <Pymous> But when I submit the form
[10:01:01] <Pymous> On my test controller, I don't have the appended input
[10:02:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing where you're defining the input var.
[10:02:42] <robertmaxrees> Pymous http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snvu0aeg/1/
[10:02:58] <Pymous> robertmaxreest : the whole function is a bit more big, i just took the part intersting for the pastebin
[10:03:04] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:03:10] <robertmaxrees> you're asking me to troubleshoot blind.
[10:03:11] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[10:03:31] <Pymous> I will do a proper JSFiddle then :)
[10:03:37] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  thank you.
[10:10:40] <styx_> hi! im developing a homepage in django. can someone tell me please, why response in success() is always undefined? I get a 200 response with "{"filename": "eaee848c33eae220bb63c338df73cfe2.apk"}" in my browser... :( http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?476978
[10:11:09] <Xoro> $(ar_array[x]).appendTo("#container"); Is this the correct way to append an object inside an array to a parent?
[10:11:27] <Xoro> When I run it nothing shows up
[10:11:49] <robertmaxrees> Xoro probably?
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[10:12:06] <robertmaxrees> styx_ make sure the format is correct for the response.
[10:12:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery might be complaining about the response format.
[10:13:06] <robertmaxrees> styx_ use the error callback and see what the issue might be.
[10:16:55] <Xoro> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/tsr3pgna/ It doesn't seem to work in this example.
[10:17:26] <robertmaxrees> Xoro because it bombs on myArray[0] = [$foo];
[10:17:34] <robertmaxrees> and i wouldn't do things that way personally.
[10:18:11] <Xoro> It bombs?
[10:18:20] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[10:18:28] <styx_> robertmaxrees: thx ;)
[10:19:35] <robertmaxrees> Xoro also that's not how you create new elements in jquery
[10:20:50] <Xoro> Well I'm trying to create a set of elements that are identical by using for loops to generate them and a function to change a few randomized CSS values while storing each object in an array.
[10:20:54] <styx_> what would be the best way, to show a loading screen for the user while waiting for an server process to complete? polling from the user via a post isn't the best i think :(
[10:21:26] <robertmaxrees> Xoro that's not a good way to do that.
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> are you appending these to some set elements or what?
[10:21:41] <robertmaxrees> like, how many do you need to create?
[10:22:25] <Xoro> Just the one parent, I was thinking about 100. I should be able to change it with a single variable depending on how I want it to look after.
[10:22:33] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[10:22:36] <robertmaxrees> uh, okay.
[10:22:47] <Xoro> 100 <p>'s ain't that crazy
[10:22:55] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you'd do that.
[10:23:01] <robertmaxrees> but there's a much more efficient way to do this.
[10:23:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tsr3pgna/1/
[10:23:40] <Xoro> Well I'm no wizard. I can only work with what I know and learn the other half.
[10:24:06] <robertmaxrees> instead of generating them all up front, clone from a single element on an as-needed basis.
[10:24:33] <Xoro> But how would I modify them individually after .clone?
[10:24:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tsr3pgna/2/
[10:25:38] <robertmaxrees> alternatively http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tsr3pgna/3/
[10:26:28] <Xoro> Thanks. I'll start fixing it.
[10:26:42] <robertmaxrees> though i hate for loops, this is actually a legit use case hahaha
[10:31:18] <kokut> Hello, a website i'm working on is thrownig an error, "unrecognized expression: ui.accordion ui.accordion-header#accordion- !"
[10:31:28] <Uhkis> whats wrong with for loops?
[10:31:39] <kokut> on jquery.js ver=1.11.1:2
[10:31:39] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis they're prescriptive instead of descriptive.
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> kokut that looks like an invalid selector.
[10:31:59] <robertmaxrees> ui.accordion ui.accordion-header#accordion-
[10:32:10] <kokut> robertmaxrees: is there a way to find where is the call being made
[10:32:33] <kokut> because this site is a mess, it has dozens of plugins and its all entangled
[10:32:46] <robertmaxrees> kokut the stack trace should show you.
[10:33:06] <kokut> robertmaxrees: how
[10:33:32] <robertmaxrees> kokut http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 will show you :)
[10:36:53] <kokut> robertmaxrees: omg that website looks awful
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> kokut it's a slideshow.
[10:37:07] <kokut> no kidding
[10:37:19] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide7 start here.
[10:52:01] <cordovafan8> Hello. I'm having an issue with a synchronous $.ajax() call and a $.get() call. If I interrupt the $.get() call with the $.ajax() call, I seem to get a much longer delay than if I just run the $.ajax() separately. I'm running jqm 1.3.1 and jq 1.9.1 on web/android/iOS via cordova.
[10:52:04] <sniperh4x0r> Hey guys, is there a way to do something like a preventDefault() but it actually prevents any other javascript code from being triggered
[10:52:28] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 don't run ajax calls synchronously.
[10:52:53] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r huh?  you mean any other handlers on that element?
[10:53:23] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r if so, check out https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[10:54:08] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: unfortunately this one is required to be synchronous
[10:54:16] <robertmaxrees> you want to freeze the browser?
[10:54:19] <robertmaxrees> wat?
[10:54:31] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to do that?
[10:54:48] <tw2113> just put it in a bucket and stash the bucket in a walkin freezer
[10:54:51] <tw2113> easy peasy
[10:55:08] <cordovafan8> because it gets a piece of data that is a requirement for the entire rest of the program
[10:55:24] <robertmaxrees> so use deferreds to call the rest of the code when it's done.
[10:56:00] <cordovafan8> for the entire codebase?
[10:56:08] <cordovafan8> that seems a little nuts
[10:56:23] <cordovafan8> this is literally the reason for the sync option
[10:56:35] <robertmaxrees> it's not terribly uncommon the have an "initialize" function kick things off.
[10:56:37] <sniperh4x0r> I have an isMobile variable in my js that detects if the user is on a phone device or tablet. Is there a way I can make a variable to detect if the user is on only a phone and not care if it's a tablet?
[10:56:49] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it's kind of crazy that you're not preloading that data to begin with.
[10:57:22] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: it's unfortunately dynamic, so we have to call this more than once to validate etc
[10:57:27] <sniperh4x0r> or rather only a phone and not a tablet*
[10:57:41] <robertmaxrees> then you absolutely want to use deferreds.  that's a much cleaner solution that freezing the browser.
[10:58:14] <robertmaxrees> *that = than
[10:58:24] <cordovafan8> wouldn't deferred's do the same? We can't have any code run until it's done anyway?
[10:58:34] <robertmaxrees> except deferreds won't freeze the browser.
[10:58:45] <cordovafan8> what will they display?
[10:58:48] <robertmaxrees> and those ajax calls could run in parrallel.
[10:58:53] <robertmaxrees> they can display whatever you want them to.
[11:10:04] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: the sync call is in a delegate pagebeforeshow bind, how can I guarrantee the pagebeforeshow bind doesn't complete (or delay the pageshow) before the deferred function completes?
[11:10:18] <cordovafan8> do I just trigger pageshow?
[11:10:31] <cordovafan8> no that won't work
[11:10:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:10:42] <robertmaxrees> your question doesn't make sense.
[11:10:58] <cordovafan8> what do you mean>
[11:11:00] <cordovafan8> ?*
[11:11:19] <robertmaxrees> are you triggering the async call inside of an event listener?
[11:11:33] <cordovafan8> yes, but it's currently sync
[11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call is sync.
[11:11:45] <cordovafan8> yes
[11:11:57] <robertmaxrees> so you need ot make sure that ajax call finishes before pageshow happens?
[11:12:00] <cordovafan8> but I'm trying to setup defers to avoid that per your suggestion
[11:12:02] <cordovafan8> yes
[11:12:24] <robertmaxrees> erm, how are you trying to defer?
[11:12:42] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you use promises and call stuff within your pageshow.
[11:12:42] <cordovafan8> just with $.when().done()
[11:13:14] <robertmaxrees> right, so when you .done() on the deferred object, it'll run only when that object resolves.
[11:13:41] <cordovafan8> will that line not get passed, and the pagebeforeshow handler end>
[11:13:43] <cordovafan8> ?*
[11:13:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:13:51] <cordovafan8> even if it's not done?
[11:14:06] <robertmaxrees> .done() only runs when the promise object is resolved.
[11:14:08] <cordovafan8> or does the $.when.done() stop execution
[11:14:38] <uskerine> I have a button and I would like once clicked that button HTML is replaced with a text, is that possible?
[11:14:59] <uskerine> well I know is possible, I mean, which would be a good way to do it (just general ideas)
[11:15:10] <robertmaxrees> uskerine setting .test() on the button...
[11:15:20] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 you're convoluting deferreds.
[11:15:58] <cordovafan8> I'm a bit confused, because if the $.when line doesn't block, then the pagebeforeshow handler may complete before the deferred resolves, defeating the purpose
[11:16:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're confusing yourself, one sec.
[11:16:40] <uskerine> what test() does?
[11:16:43] <cordovafan8> if it does block, then the difference between that and a sync ajax call seems like nothing?
[11:16:46] <robertmaxrees> uskerine *text
[11:16:53] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 it doesn't block.
[11:16:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/ cordovafan8
[11:17:08] <uskerine> Oh I see
[11:17:31] <uskerine> I did not explain it well, I want the whole button be removed/hidden and a <p> appear instead
[11:17:42] <robertmaxrees> uskerine then use .replace() on the button.
[11:17:47] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 notice how things only run when you click the link?
[11:18:34] <uskerine> great, thanks robertmaxrees
[11:18:49] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 that's how you use deferreds here.
[11:19:44] <uskerine> one more question, buttons have no ID (they could, but they don't), is there a way to specify in the action of the button something that would refer the invoking element (i.e. the button itself)
[11:19:49] <uskerine> so I can apply the .replace() method
[11:20:12] <robertmaxrees> uskerine are you using a click event binding?
[11:20:23] <robertmaxrees> like $('button').on('click', function() {}); ?
[11:20:35] <uskerine> the problem is that I am generating those buttons dynamically
[11:20:37] <uskerine> so they do not have ID
[11:20:50] <uskerine> I was thinking in using a function somehow
[11:20:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:20:59] <robertmaxrees> uskerine answer the question.
[11:21:05] <uskerine> no I am not
[11:21:11] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding to them then?
[11:21:18] <uskerine> actually I can't now you say so
[11:21:23] <uskerine> I see
[11:21:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:21:41] <uskerine>  render: function(data) { return buttonViewPassword(data) } }
[11:21:51] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding the listeners to the buttons?
[11:21:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not binding anything.
[11:22:00] <uskerine> function buttonViewPassword(data) {   return '<button type="button" class="btn-flat btn-primary" password="'+data+'" action=">Ver Contrasea</button>'   }
[11:22:04] <uskerine> this is what I am trying to do
[11:22:15] <robertmaxrees> right, that renders the button.
[11:22:25] <robertmaxrees> how do you plan on replacing the button with a <p> tag?
[11:22:49] <uskerine> I need to do something so when user clicks the button a function is invoked, and that function is able to identify the button to apply replace method
[11:22:53] <uskerine> but I do not  know how to do it
[11:23:04] <robertmaxrees> okay, that's simple.
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> uskerine http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7g71kcL9/
[11:25:49] <uskerine> uhm maybe just a class selector (passwordButtons) is enough
[11:26:00] <uskerine> thanks I think that helps
[11:26:00] <robertmaxrees> User458764 huh?
[11:26:07] <robertmaxrees> err, uskerine huh?
[11:26:20] <robertmaxrees> $(this) inside the handler refers to the button you clicked.
[11:26:21] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[11:26:23] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: I'm still not understanding how this might apply to events. The code following the $.when(secondpromise...) still runs (the setTimeout to resolve), so the event handler will finish and pageshow will execute before the promise resolves in some cases.
[11:26:38] <uskerine> buttons are generated dynamically (basically  a datatables column data (password) is replaced with a button <VIEW PASSWORD> that once pressed must show password for that user
[11:26:55] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 right.  so within pageshow you'd do your .done() call.
[11:26:56] <uskerine> so a generic selector (button) does not work
[11:27:19] <robertmaxrees> uskerine oh that's what you mean.
[11:27:35] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 .done() runs one time as soon as the deferred has resolved.
[11:27:58] <robertmaxrees> you can run that .done() call before or after it's resolved - doesn't make a difference.
[11:28:03] <robertmaxrees> it'll just run as soon as it's resolved.
[11:28:19] <robertmaxrees> if it's already resolved when you run .done() against it, the code will execute immediately.
[11:30:39] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: but by then I'm already in the pageshow? I can't run any of the code that I deferred from the pagebeforeshow at that point? I'm either missing something or a sync call is what I actually need
[11:31:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:31:21] <robertmaxrees> as long as you have a shared scope between the two handlers, you're fine.
[11:31:46] <cordovafan8> No but there are other things I want to run before the pageshow
[11:31:54] <cordovafan8> and these need to happen after the sync call
[11:32:05] <robertmaxrees> you can still use deferreds for that.
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:32:09] <cordovafan8> so I've deferred them, but they need to run before the pageshow
[11:32:17] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[11:32:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to run the pageshow logic after they've completed.
[11:32:29] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking about this backwards.
[11:32:31] <cordovafan8> no
[11:32:38] <cordovafan8> jqm renders the page
[11:32:41] <cordovafan8> on pageshow
[11:32:44] <cordovafan8> that is a hard limit
[11:32:48] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[11:33:22] <cordovafan8> so I need to finish the code that needs to setup the page before pageshow
[11:34:09] <robertmaxrees> is is jqm that relies on this finishing, or do you have your own code that relies on it?
[11:34:27] <robertmaxrees> ie did you put the code in the pageshow event yourself?
[11:34:53] <cordovafan8> well not personally, but yes
[11:35:14] <cordovafan8> I can't move everything to pagebeforeshow or vice versa though
[11:35:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[11:35:20] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:35:26] <robertmaxrees> you're really confused :)
[11:38:21] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/e8odf21/
[11:38:23] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[11:38:26] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 check this out.
[11:39:38] <cordovafan8> ok, but in that situation the page may still render before the ajax is complete
[11:39:48] <cordovafan8> because pageshow is called
[11:40:45] <cordovafan8> none of my code will go, which is nice, but the page will be shown possibly without any of the setup :(
[11:40:51] <cordovafan8> really need to defer the pageshow event
[11:41:05] <robertmaxrees> have a loading screen if it's that important then.
[11:41:05] <cordovafan8> but I think I'll stick with the sync call
[11:41:08] <robertmaxrees> just don't lock the browser.
[11:41:32] <cordovafan8> I just have a loading spinner while its going
[11:42:08] <cordovafan8> the issue is that a $.get() call can be interrupted by the sync call I think
[11:42:26] <robertmaxrees> right, your entire base problem is because you're insisting on disabling async.
[11:42:38] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm pointing you in the direction of not doing that ;)
[11:43:00] <cordovafan8> I actually want the $.get() to be interrupted
[11:43:07] <cordovafan8> but not for that to cause issues
[11:43:11] <NoiseEee> cordovafan8: its like choosing to make a chocolate dessert but trying to stay away from sugar
[11:43:23] <cordovafan8> for instance, the sync call is fine when coming from any other page
[11:43:30] <NoiseEee> javascript has async as part of its essence; embrace it
[11:43:38] <cordovafan8> but if it comes from the page with an active $.get() call, then there is a small delay
[11:44:01] <cordovafan8> if I wait until the $.get() finishes there is also no problem
[11:44:38] <cordovafan8> I've tried to .abort() the $.get() but I think my jq version is too old
[11:45:01] <NoiseEee> the only way you know when a .get() is really finished is by using deferreds as robertmaxrees has gone out of his way to show you
[11:46:21] <cordovafan8> In that case I'm not trying to defer the get, but to stop it, since it is interrupting the next ajax call.. I actually haven't tested if it also occurs with async
[11:46:54] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 you're really fighting against how js works at this point.
[11:49:34] <cordovafan8> well it seems that changing the call to async doesn't solve the issue either
[11:49:47] <cordovafan8> any action on the page is blocked until the async call is done
[11:50:01] <robertmaxrees> something else is setting async: false; then.
[11:50:04] <cordovafan8> but the page transition is not delayed
[11:50:28] <cordovafan8> weird
[11:51:40] <cordovafan8> there aren't any jq or jqm functions that default to sync are there?
[11:52:00] <robertmaxrees> errr....
[11:52:10] <cordovafan8> I didn't think there were
[11:52:16] <robertmaxrees> most of them would be blocking.
[11:52:28] <cordovafan8> oh sorry, I mean
[11:52:33] <robertmaxrees> so technically, the vast majority are "sync"
[11:52:48] <cordovafan8> I mean ajax class functions like $.get/$.post/$.getJSON etc
[11:53:00] <cordovafan8> replacements for $.ajax()
[11:53:08] <robertmaxrees> convenience methods for ajax.
[11:53:18] <robertmaxrees> and depending on settings, you can trigger sync: true iirc.
[11:53:18] <cordovafan8> yes, that's what I meant, god I suck at words
[11:53:27] <gtristan> Any recommendation for a plugin to help in the work of printing the DOM ? There seem to be a few out there, I'm looking at this one: https://github.com/RitsC/PrintArea
[11:53:45] <robertmaxrees> gtristan use css instead.
[11:53:50] <robertmaxrees> create print styles.
[11:54:43] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, hmmm, I thought I would be doing that anyway :-S
[11:55:44] <robertmaxrees> gtristan just do that to begin with then?
[11:55:49] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you need a plugin for.
[11:55:56] <gtristan> well in other words, what is the point of a print plugin ? I was only hoping to avoid some cross-browser 'gotchas' by pulling in some couple hundred loc
[11:56:25] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm wondering.  there should be no "gotchas", with one major exception: you have no real control over how things print.
[11:57:21] <gtristan> right, I'm not sure either then... lemme take a closer look, if he's anything like me he will have commented on the gotchas...
[11:57:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:04:25] <PigDude__> hey, I haven't worked w/ jquery.Deferred all that often, am i doing something plainly wrong here that causes done/fail to not be called on 404? my test runner reports the 404 but log messages in those done/fails don't appear
[12:04:31] <PigDude__> https://bpaste.net/show/bbf36c52f43a
[12:05:06] <robertmaxrees> where'd you define the deferred object itself?
[12:05:15] <PigDude__> oh let me show the whole method
[12:05:25] <PigDude__> but i only care about the callbacks i showed
[12:05:41] <robertmaxrees> then only show me the related code...
[12:05:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:07:29] <PigDude__> what i mean is that my question stands w/ no reference to the deferreds
[12:07:51] <robertmaxrees> the code, as provided, should work fine.
[12:08:25] <robertmaxrees> without seeing how you're defining the deferred var, it's hard to know what's going one.
[12:08:32] <robertmaxrees> *defining, handling that var.
[12:09:20] <PigDude__> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/26ebf1464a27
[12:09:28] <PigDude__> robertmaxrees: that's the actual code. the console.logs don't fire
[12:09:49] <robertmaxrees> do you get any erors?
[12:09:51] <robertmaxrees> *errors
[12:10:04] <robertmaxrees> if neither of those console logs fire, that means that the ajax call isn't running in the first place.
[12:10:15] <PigDude__> no
[12:10:25] <PigDude__> no errors, and i showed the 404 from the test runner, so it's sure running
[12:10:31] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab - do you see the ajax call even runs?
[12:10:44] <PigDude__> the network tab in my terminal? this is a phantomjs test runner
[12:10:57] <PigDude__> so i can't do that unfortunately
[12:11:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to make sure that the ajax call is running in the first place.
[12:11:20] <robertmaxrees> if the console.logs() don't work, that means that the call isn't running.
[12:11:38] <PigDude__> so how does the test runner get 404 /the/url
[12:11:52] <PigDude__> hm ..
[12:13:43] <uskerine> robertmax what if I would like to restore back the button once that has passed 30 seconds after the user clicked it
[12:13:44] <uskerine> ?
[12:14:13] <robertmaxrees> uskerine then change your strategy.  render out the button and p tag, then show one and hide the other.
[12:14:38] <uskerine> uhm, understood
[12:14:39] <uskerine> thanks
[12:15:16] <PigDude__> thanks for looking robertmaxrees
[12:15:28] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[12:16:34] <PigDude__> oh nope
[12:16:36] <uskerine> how do I say "the <p> that follows 'this' ?
[12:16:42] <PigDude__> but that's all right
[12:16:53] <robertmaxrees> uskerine check out siblings()
[12:19:29] <uskerine> so I have $(this).hide(); and $(this).siblings().show(); which hiddens the button and shows the password, how do I revert the hide and show after 'n' seconds?   .delay().show() and .delay().hide()?
[12:21:34] <PigDude__> robertmaxrees: i had to return the thing returning a deferred from my test case so that jasmine knew to not terminate
[12:21:39] * PigDude__ feels dumb
[12:22:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> uskerine a timeout,.
[12:24:40] <abishek> anybody know of a jquery library that can generate timeseries using jquery or javascript based on a start date and end date and an interval is specified
[12:26:21] <robertmaxrees> abishek lots of choices.  http://stackoverflow.com/a/7114245/923919 and http://stackoverflow.com/a/29145171/923919 were both found on google.
[12:38:16] <knn> anyone here know slickquiz ?
[12:38:36] <robertmaxrees> knn they might.
[12:39:21] <knn> robertmaxrees : ok
[12:39:31] <uskerine> what happens if I have .delay(30000).fadeOut(100) for a given item (say a <p> element) and I force a .hide() before those 30 seconds?
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> uskerine .delay() doesn't work unless you're already in an animation queue.
[12:39:57] <robertmaxrees> but .hide() will run anyway.
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> then it'll try to run the fadeout.
[12:40:05] <uskerine> :-!, delay is working for me
[12:40:15] <uskerine>  $(this).hide().delay( 100+30000+2000 ).fadeIn( 2000 );
[12:40:15] <uskerine>                         $(this).siblings().show().delay( 30000 ).fadeOut( 2000 );
[12:40:47] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste into the channel, and ah.
[12:41:00] <robertmaxrees> you'ree in a queue.
[12:41:11] <uskerine> what defines if you are in a queue or not?
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/delay/ docs explain it.  to answer your first question, it'll hide the element, then try to run the fadeOut.
[12:44:27] <uskerine> thanks, understood
[12:44:37] <uskerine> but running a fadeOut on a hidden element does not hurt
[12:44:40] <uskerine> so it will work
[12:44:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid whatever case you're coming up with in the first place.
[12:44:59] <robertmaxrees> but basically yeah.
[12:45:02] <robertmaxrees> though not idea.
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> *ideal
[12:46:32] <uskerine> once the user clicks on the password button, the password is shown and it will fadeOut after 30 seconds (and the button will appear again), but I would like to add the possibility of hide the password before those 30 seconds
[12:48:10] <gtek1k> hey guys, sorry if this is a basic issue but for some reason the .replace() isn't working, any ideas? http://collabedit.com/afdgh
[12:48:22] <gtek1k> I mainly want to strip an input down to only TLD
[12:48:23] <uskerine> that's why I want to hide() before delay().fadeOut()
[12:48:30] <uskerine> maybe not the cleanest thing in the world
[12:48:45] <robertmaxrees> gtek1k which part "doesn't work"?
[12:48:54] <robertmaxrees> you mean the actual value doesn't update?
[12:48:56] <gtek1k> its not stripping out the https://
[12:48:57] <gtek1k> ya
[12:49:05] <robertmaxrees> does the console log work?
[12:49:08] <gtek1k> ya
[12:49:16] <gtek1k> its returning full URL with the http part still
[12:49:26] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:49:41] <gtek1k> lol its so basic cant believe im having issue
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[12:50:05] <robertmaxrees> is #website an actual input?
[12:53:25] <gtek1k> robertmaxrees, please see http://jsfiddle.net/bpaprkf2/
[12:53:44] <gtek1k> just type in the put like www.something
[12:53:46] <gtek1k> it should remove the www.
[12:54:15] <gtek1k> in the input*
[12:55:01] <gtek1k> am I retarded all of a sudden or?
[12:55:08] <robertmaxrees> heh, not an okay thing to say btw.
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> and one sec.
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace - "The replace() method returns a new string..."
[12:56:52] <unnu> Question for the jquery leets out there: i have an array with classes (like the ones you take in college) that i want to send a json to a page. Is there an easy way to get from a list view (i.e. 1,12:00,1:30,Human Anatomy, Sci111 being id,start time, end time, description, and course number) to a schedule view?
[12:57:02] <robertmaxrees> gtek1k http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bpaprkf2/1/
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> unnu could you clarify?
[12:57:41] <gtek1k> this looks good thanks robertmaxrees
[12:57:44] <unnu> i will show you
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> gtek1k see the issue?
[12:58:00] <gtek1k> no
[12:58:03] <robertmaxrees> .replace() doesn't modify the original string - it gives you the fixed version.
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> so you have to do $theVal = $theVal.toLowerCase();
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[12:58:13] <gtek1k> ohh got it
[12:58:20] <gtek1k> needed to set the var
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:58:23] <gtek1k> cause wasnt saving it anywhere
[12:58:28] <gtek1k> thanks man lol
[13:04:38] <pauled> Hi JQ-people  :)
[13:05:24] <pauled> getting trouble with that http://fiddle.jshell.net/2zahwwqt/3/
[13:05:43] <pauled> can't see 'lese' work
[13:05:50] <pauled> 'else'*
[13:05:56] <robertmaxrees> woah wtf.
[13:06:11] <pauled> yes?
[13:06:20] <_mak> when I .load() a page into the current one, can I right away referentiate elements from the loaded page with $(".class") or do I have to do something before?
[13:06:31] <abishek> robertmaxrees, thnx twix was very helpful
[13:06:53] <robertmaxrees> _mak you need to use .done() to make sure the page has finished loading.
[13:07:37] <robertmaxrees> pauled you mean for th4e localstorage bit?
[13:07:44] <robertmaxrees> because it's woirking fine for me.
[13:08:07] <_mak> robertmaxrees: ahh, is there a way to 'sleep' while the .load is running?
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> _mak not without freezing the browsers.
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> *browser.
[13:08:25] <robertmaxrees> embrace async.
[13:08:30] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I don't see the css and the color for .red
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://i.imgur.com/rlyn8xO.png
[13:09:04] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[13:09:12] <uskerine> css style to make cursor appear same as when hovering over buttons?
[13:09:19] <robertmaxrees> uskerine try google.
[13:09:58] <pauled> robertmaxrees: it's alway .blue here
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> pauled that means you set that item in localstorage already
[13:10:57] <pauled> robertmaxrees: no, if you untich the checkbox and then re-run jsfiddle, in localstorage is false
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> actually, it's string false, not boolean false ;)
[13:11:29] <pauled> i don't get it what is wrong
[13:11:52] <robertmaxrees> if (localStorage.getItem('auto-rematch-check0-state')) will always be true for you, because any non-empty string is "truthy"
[13:11:58] <robertmaxrees> including the string 'false'
[13:12:18] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/2zahwwqt/5/
[13:12:20] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[13:12:28] <pauled> thanks :)
[13:12:34] <gtek1k> robertmaxrees, do you know if its possible from single click to open multiple new windows ?
[13:12:51] <robertmaxrees> gtek1k possibly, yeah, but that's a really distracting UX.
[13:13:08] <gtek1k> well its for internal use doing research on domains
[13:13:19] <gtek1k> my goal is to give one user input and then it opens 5 windows with the domain already filled
[13:13:27] <gtek1k> it seems like chrome will only allow one new window at a time though
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> uh, why?
[13:13:48] <gtek1k> ya just tested it works in firefox
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean why do you want to open those windows?
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> what's this "research"?
[13:14:08] <gtek1k> ill show you in PM
[13:14:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> or in the channel?
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> if you can PM it, you can share it here :)
[13:14:31] <gtek1k> not really
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:14:56] <gtek1k> I would prefer to keep it private
[13:15:00] <gtek1k> its not for public use
[13:15:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm some rando that cpould do anything with that info. hell, i could have my logs publicly available for all you know.
[13:15:15] <gtek1k> yea im not that worried but first line of defense
[13:15:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm not asking to see the tool, i'm asking what the tool actually does.
[13:15:49] <gtek1k> "I want to know how your filet tastes but I dont want to taste it" ? lol
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:08] <robertmaxrees> clarify "doing research on domains"
[13:16:33] <gtek1k> ex: semrush.com hypestat.com
[13:17:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to open 5 different sites like this at once?
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch
[13:19:50] <gtek1k> exactly
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> before i disappear, that's all i needed to know btw.  not sure why you needed to try to give me a hard time over it.
[13:21:08] <pauled> robertLunch: ah, bon appetit then :)
[13:22:50] <jrkie> hello, i have a very basic question here, can someone help? i need to activate play when the document is loaded, it is now activated with a button: http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/ thanks in advance, i know only how it works with jquery
[13:23:53] <jrkie> since the page is so small i don't need jquery i believe
[13:24:16] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded @ jrkie
[13:27:12] <jrkie> NoiseEee: yes thanks, can you help with my jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/
[13:27:44] <NoiseEee> jrkie: it should be pretty straight forward
[13:28:00] <NoiseEee> you have: blasterTrigger.addEventListener("click", function(){
[13:28:08] <NoiseEee> the example has document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
[13:28:27] <NoiseEee> pretty sure you can just swap the one for the other?
[13:28:42] <JqueryConflicts> Hi everyone, i need a little tip to understand why I succeed creating this button with this effect here jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6638/ but the same code do not work here http://www.vedelago.gov.it/TestNewsletter2.html
[13:30:25] <jrkie> NoiseEee: yes i replaced it but it didn't work
[13:30:35] <JqueryConflicts> (probably there is a JqueryConflict my I am a total newbie on this & jquery, i did not figure out after looking at the docs ) . NOTE: i cannot move away the other .js present on the 2nd link i wrote (my test page)
[13:30:56] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to display a variable that I define outside a function and I manipulate in the function, but I not get results. Any help please? https://jsfiddle.net/Lgz7n6aL/
[13:31:07] <jrkie> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/2/
[13:33:11] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/3/ @ jrkie
[13:33:29] <NoiseEee> just had to "move" the JS to <body>  (via the select option in jsfiddle)
[13:34:39] <mathu> i'm trying to get the selected option of a dropdown list to change with jquery. so far i have tried `$('#...').val('65')` and `$('#...').attr('selectedIndex', 65)` to no avail
[13:34:42] <jrkie> NoiseEee: ah jsfiddle didn't work right with it, well, thanks anyways
[13:34:43] <mathu> what else might i try
[13:36:15] <mathu> oh, i also tried and was unable to select the option with `$('option[value=65]').attr('selected', 'selected')` but the $() returns empty
[13:36:34] <dan_j> Hi. Im making a signup for using jquery and ajax. I want to ensure that if the browser is refreshed, the user can continue without starting from the beginning. Whats the best way to save a session ID using javascript/jquery?
[13:38:11] <NoiseEee> jrkie: ok, but what I pasted is working, i hear audio and it starts right away. good luck
[13:42:35] <jrkie> NoiseEee: yes it does in mozilla firefox and chrome on ubuntu, but it doesn't autoplay on my ipad i believe, however it does with the function in the button i used before
[13:43:24] <NoiseEee> jrkie: its the same function.
[13:43:31] <NoiseEee> jrkie: you just changed the event listener.
[13:43:50] <jrkie> i know, it's just the ipad that is the problem
[13:44:02] <jrkie> it doesn't allow it with the html5player or something
[13:44:23] <jrkie> however it allow's it to play with a button on the ipad
[13:44:52] <NoiseEee> yeah
[13:45:01] <NoiseEee> seems the ipad does not allow auto-playing of audio or video
[13:46:04] <JqueryConflicts> In case someone did read my last 22:30 message, the only code not directly present in the HTML page, but available through an href, is this http://www.vedelago.gov.it/resources/templating-kit/themes/comune/css/mailchimp-form.2015-05-12-21-59-47-359.cache.css
[13:46:16] <NoiseEee> jrkie: you can google for workarounds.
[13:46:49] <jrkie> yeah, will do that tomorrow
[13:53:02] <pauled> How I can dynamically use localStorage checkbox input without reloading the page? http://fiddle.jshell.net/2zahwwqt/5/
[13:54:53] <pauled> any idea? perhaps .change() ?
[13:55:44] <JqueryConflicts> Noone at least for a tip in the right direction in the docs aboot my specific case? Any info will be appreciated ;)
[13:56:59] <VectorX> hi anyone here familer with html5 history api and loading new pages when scrolling down, im looking for a good tute on it someone knows one ?
[13:57:49] <mr_pinc> Hello I believe I have found a bug - I have a fixed aspect ratio app that is scaling as the browser window changes via - CSS zoom - somewhere in my app i need to scroll some items - I use $(elementToScrollTo).position() to determine the amount to scroll.  In chrome - the value is alway correct no matter how small/big the app is scaled - in IE though, the smaller I scale the browser - the smaller
[13:57:49] <mr_pinc> the value becomes - creating inconsitency
[13:59:44] <mr_pinc> Sorry same problem in Firefox as well - chrome is all good
[14:00:14] <VectorX> mr_pinc are you trying to say that if this continues it could cause ripples in the space time continuum putting us all on a course towards an uncertain future ?
[14:00:38] <mr_pinc> it's not quite that severe - but it's close
[14:02:02] <JqueryConflicts> anyone would like to see the sourcecode of the 2 pages i posted in the previous message and help understanding why the modal form do not come up in the 2nd link? (i'll be here just another hour hoping for a reply)
[14:03:58] <JqueryConflicts> Uhkis: Hi Uhkis, are you still there? i'm half a way to solution ..
[14:08:58] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: the first conflict are because HTML is no valid, too many duplcate id
[14:10:20] <pauled> there is two "open confirm dialog"
[14:10:33] <rubyonrailed> I have a nested array that looks like this: http://imgur.com/TxZtN7T   Say I have an ID for an active_district.  How do I search the array for that active_district value, then grab all the school nested below that certain district.
[14:13:11] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: thanks pauled, now there is just one button on my test page . I have just reloaded the page with devConsole in chrome open and i get this error {ncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined} . Do you think it's actually this that prevent the CORRECT behaviour that happend in the identical jsfiiddle link? TY in advance pauled
[14:14:54] <pauled> hmm don't look at me, I am totally noob at coding. I am tourist here trying to make a greasemonkey userscript for a chess site
[14:18:46] <jonez> greetings. I have a question. I am using a jquery plugin called ion.rangeslider. I have it set up the way I want except that the value is in a "property" vs. an "attribute" and I don't know how to access it. please help :)
[14:28:38] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: do you know how to trigger the btnOpenDialog from the console?
[14:31:50] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: also try to move <!-- INIZIO EXTERNAL FILES --> and the external css, js into <head>
[14:32:58] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: thank you pauled, if you reload the page the 2nd of your message is already done . i'm googling about trigging from the consolle (should be something like document.getElementById("xx.click  ) now i  am trying
[14:37:22] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: thanks for your patient really pauled, i'm quite new in this js jquery word.. from the consolle i (try to) execute document.getElementById("btnOpenDialog").click();  BUT return undefined =(
[14:41:04] <quackgyver> How can I make an event fire when I'm clicking on a link?
[14:41:19] <quackgyver> Right now I have $( "#auth a" ).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); _500px.login; });
[14:41:24] <quackgyver> Anything wrong about that?
[14:48:25] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: =( just other 30 sec of yours to look? sorry about the pressing, it's for my boss before tomorrow! I'm working on this irrelevent thing since yesterday! I was about to open eg: a request on freelancer but 30bucks for this minimal thing seems eccessive..
[14:52:00] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: I know nothing, but if I were you, I will go step by step in simplifying to the maximum the code then you add step by step what it takes as long as it works.
[14:54:36] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: sorry if it can't help. I am totally newbie at coding. Just some notion of html
[14:57:09] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: really? but you helped me out a bit =) . btw i've added a breakpoints on mouse click and seeing which part of js is executed after i click the (only) button in the page.. but after that, i cannot arrive to any conclusion for the knowledge i have now.. do u have more so is meaning if i remain up here or you have not this knowledge too or are busy now? thanks in advance for your fast answer
[14:58:46] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: (i don't know if i can paste here in freenode - please don't delete me out!) the js it seeems to loop on is this:
[14:58:48] <JqueryConflicts> eventHandle = elemData.handle; 		if ( !eventHandle ) { 			elemData.handle = eventHandle = function( e ) { 				// Discard the second event of a jQuery.event.trigger() and 				// when an event is called after a page has unloaded 				return typeof jQuery !== "undefined" && (!e || jQuery.event.triggered !== e.type) ? 					jQuery.event.dispatch.apply( eventHandle.elem, arguments ) : 					undefined; 			}; 			// Add elem as a proper
[15:00:01] <pauled> JqueryConflicts: I am not busy, no, just less knowledge than you.
[15:01:21] <JqueryConflicts> pauled: no, surely you are not .. btw Cork this morning in less than 60sec helped me out a lot, I perceived him as a dragon! what a pity noone right now =/ uff i won't succeed for tomorrow =(
[15:03:07] <pauled> currently I am learning basic http://api.jquery.com/change/
[15:03:07] <WebDragon> for a moment there I could have sworn you were a Markov Chain bot
[15:03:55] <pauled> WebDragon: who?
[15:04:50] <pauled> currently I am learning basic http://api.jquery.com/change/
[15:04:51] <JqueryConflicts> ;) WebDragon
[15:06:11] * WebDragon grinz
[15:06:37] <JqueryConflicts> ok so, good jquery community, i'm BEGGING for 2-3 mins of a boss of your to look at the source code of 2 pages (1 works, 1not - same hrefs & code) could anyone now help me figuring out? ;-(
[15:12:23] <User900> hello, anybody can help me to find why a button who use a very simple jquery script into onclick attribute dont runs?
[15:12:45] <User900> i'm wasting a lot of hours with in this case and i don't found nothing
[15:13:03] <User900> i did other examples like this and they works, but not this...
[15:13:43] <Mr21> User900: you have to show your code.
[15:13:52] <User900> okey Mr21
[15:14:23] <Mr21> User900: try to put some "console.log('debug');" every where, in your callback etc. with this technique you can understand what is called, what is not called
[15:15:00] <BobFrankly> or some alerts, so you can rush torwards insanity ever faster
[15:15:21] <User900> this is the code Mr21 , and when i click the button it dont change nothing http://pastebin.com/4RKJcy8a
[15:15:48] <User900> to debug i use the default debugger of firefox, to see the result html code.
[15:16:42] <User900> and i'm using sublime text, and this editor don't underline error syntaxs and nothing
[15:16:58] <Mr21> User900: oh god ^^ you are on the wrong way... You are actually using PHP for writing some JS... really bad design
[15:17:56] <Mr21> User900: here you have TWO things to debug, maybe it's about the PHP or maybe it's about your JS
[15:18:07] <User900> Mr21, this is because i need a diferents names because this button appears in a lot of sites in the same page
[15:19:01] <snover> User900: there are these things called parameters, they allow you to provide variable data to functions so you don’t have to create a new function for every thing you are doing.
[15:20:59] <User900> i have no time to do it better yet
[15:21:21] <User900> i have to show the webpage to my teachers tomorrow
[15:21:32] <User900> they don't will see the code then...
[15:22:31] <User900> and i need to sleep uhm
[15:24:10] <User900> well... good bye, thanks to the suggests
[15:25:13] <BobFrankly> if I wanted to remove the contents of a selected object...
[15:52:23] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[15:52:56] <pauled> lcomeeeeeee
[15:53:55] <Robdgreat> weeees
[15:55:18] <pauled> robertmaxrees: do you think it's a good piece of code or can be improved? wanting to use it in my GM_userscript to store settings
[15:55:25] <pauled> http://fiddle.jshell.net/2zahwwqt/5/
[16:02:42] <pauled> how can I use it to monitor multiple settings? Do I have to use `.each`?
[16:02:46] <quackgyver> How can I make an event fire when I'm clicking on a link?
[16:02:48] <quackgyver> Right now I have $( "#auth a" ).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); _500px.login; });
[16:02:49] <quackgyver> Anything wrong about that?
[16:03:45] <pauled> quackgyver: what is preventDefault()
[16:05:37] <quackgyver> pauled: prevents the anchor from redirecting
[16:07:15] <pauled> quackgyver: fiddle?
[16:07:53] <quackgyver> pauled: of what? i just need to know how to fire an event when a link is clicked
[16:09:40] <pauled> quackgyver: of your issue! I just need to know what is in your mind since I don't have crystal ball
[16:10:52] <quackgyver> what?
[16:11:16] <quackgyver> i need to know how to trigger events when an anchor is clicked
[16:11:18] <pauled> forget it. .click() should work
[16:11:30] <quackgyver> okay
[16:11:44] <robertmaxrees> .trigger() triggers them.
[16:11:49] <robertmaxrees> .on() binds a listener.
[16:11:50] <quackgyver> ah
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> $('a').click(); is a shorthand for $('a').trigger('click');
[16:12:27] <robertmaxrees> thought traditionally you should avoid using .trigger()/click() if possible
[16:13:24] <quackgyver> I'm using the 500px API, and the problem is that when I do $("#auth a").click(_500px.login); then _500px.login runs, but when I do $( "#auth a" ).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); _500px.login; });
[16:13:25] <quackgyver> it doesn't
[16:13:36] <quackgyver> so I was just wondering if there was anything wrong about that line in itself
[16:13:45] <robertmaxrees> you want $( "#auth a" ).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); _500px.login(); });
[16:14:09] <robertmaxrees> $("#auth a").click(_500px.login); - this just needs the reference ot the function, hence no () after the name.
[16:14:22] <quackgyver> im wondering why the latter isnt working while the former does then
[16:14:23] <quackgyver> weird
[16:14:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:14:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm explaining it.
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> but if you're inside of a function(e) {} you need to explicitly run it.
[16:14:43] <quackgyver> I don't understand what that means.
[16:14:47] <quackgyver> oh
[16:15:03] <quackgyver> OH
[16:15:04] <quackgyver> ok
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> basically, functions are objects.
[16:15:26] <robertmaxrees> when handing in a callback, you just need to give it the name.
[16:17:02] <quackgyver> hm no
[16:17:03] <quackgyver> i still dont get it
[16:17:09] <quackgyver> i dont think i understand any of this tbh
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> let me show you then :)
[16:17:24] <quackgyver> sure, if you've got time
[16:17:39] <pauled> with a fiddle, it would have been helpful to my understanding.
[16:17:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm doing.
[16:18:08] <quackgyver> all im wondering is how to execute something from within the scope of a click
[16:18:15] <quackgyver> but without putting it in click(foo)
[16:18:21] <quackgyver> since i need to do e.preventdefault
[16:18:30] <quackgyver> on the anchor
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aoe1j7t4/
[16:19:17] <robertmaxrees> so the first one calls the function directly - hence the need to use () after the name.
[16:19:33] <robertmaxrees> the second one just passes the name of the function - runACallback(aFunction).
[16:19:51] <robertmaxrees> internally, it then runs the function for you by slapping the () after the name of the argument.
[16:20:10] <quackgyver> sorry man this is way over my head
[16:20:16] <quackgyver> i dont understand any of this
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/zbwg3ds/
[16:20:43] <quackgyver> im just trying to follow some jquery instructions to the point
[16:20:47] <robertmaxrees> long story short, that's what you want.
[16:20:52] <robertmaxrees> like i said before.
[16:21:00] <quackgyver> oh
[16:21:10] <quackgyver> yeah that did it
[16:21:13] <quackgyver> thanks a lot friend
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly run the function.  otherwise nothing does it for you.
[16:22:14] <quackgyver> ok so
[16:22:20] <quackgyver> i re-read what you were saying and i get it now
[16:22:46] <quackgyver> thanks a lot :)
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:24:16] * pauled is the only one to have understood nothing. :)
[16:24:25] <robertmaxrees> pauled where are you lost?
[16:24:34] <robertmaxrees> because the core concept is pretty simple.
[16:25:47] <pauled> everything, because I need to see the actual use.
[16:25:55] <pauled> ... to understand
[16:26:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you.
[16:27:00] <pauled> ut that tell me nothing functions without concrete utility .. :)
[16:27:06] <pauled> ut/but*
[16:27:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't see how it applies, you mean?
[16:27:22] <pauled> yeah
[16:28:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pbcwb3c1/
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('click', function(e) {}); vs $('a').on('click', someFunction);
[16:28:35] <pauled> sorry for my poor vocabulary.
[16:30:27] <robertmaxrees> see the difference between those two, pauled ?
[16:30:41] <pauled> robertmaxrees: which is better, the second?
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> that entirely depends.  generally, yes, the second version is preferred.
[16:31:08] <robertmaxrees> because now I can just call someFunction any time i want to run that code.
[16:31:42] <pauled> I see :)
[16:31:48] <pauled> thanks
[16:32:56] <robertmaxrees> that make a little more sense?
[16:33:26] <pauled> yes
[16:34:58] <pauled> can the same logic be used for this? $("input:checkbox").change(function() { $('body label').toggleClass("blue", this.checked); });
[16:35:27] <robertmaxrees> yes - .change() actually uses .on() under the hood.
[16:39:27] <quackgyver> man this fucking api is terrible
[16:39:36] <quackgyver> the documentation is a total mess. i cant do this job
[16:39:38] <quackgyver> oh well
[16:39:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:39:53] <robertmaxrees> the _500px api?
[16:39:58] <quackgyver> yes
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[16:40:50] <quackgyver> i cant get anything to work with the api. shit keeps getting stuck in eternal call loops and the tutorials keep jumping over vital steps
[16:40:57] <quackgyver> like what you're supposed to specify in the api key settinsg
[16:40:59] <quackgyver> settings*
[16:41:03] <quackgyver> working with this has just been a disaster
[16:41:13] <robertmaxrees> if you want help, we're here :)
[16:41:34] <quackgyver> honestly I don't even know where to begin. i'm just trying to get anything fundametal to work with this api
[16:41:42] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with jquery?
[16:41:45] <quackgyver> copy-pasting sample pages, following tutorials
[16:41:54] <quackgyver> but in the end shit doesn't work as described
[16:41:55] <quackgyver> ya
[16:42:06] <pauled> quackgyver: which one?
[16:42:14] <quackgyver> pauled: 500px, whatever that is
[16:42:17] <robertmaxrees> because when i explained the function reference stuff earlier, it seemed like you have no idea what i was talking about.
[16:42:21] <robertmaxrees> 500px is a photography site.
[16:42:42] <robertmaxrees> if you want to toss some stuff up in a fiddle or w/e, feel free.
[16:42:48] <pauled> quackgyver: <quackgyver: copy-pasting sample pages, following tutorials> which one?
[16:43:06] <quackgyver> pauled: this page http://500px.github.io/500px-js-sdk/#
[16:43:16] <quackgyver> robertmaxrees: well yeah, I learn by doing. I don't know everything
[16:43:34] <quackgyver> shouldn't i be able to just copypaste this page and have it work locally or something?
[16:43:58] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:45:01] <quackgyver> well
[16:45:02] <quackgyver> http://danielnorstrom.se/mobiento/
[16:45:07] <quackgyver> heres my page
[16:45:15] <pauled> quackgyver: where is the sample, what I get is "Your 500px favorite photos
[16:45:15] <pauled>  - Login to 500px
[16:45:15] <pauled> "
[16:45:28] <quackgyver> its stuck in some eternal loop because of something that is incorrectly specified in the api key settings
[16:45:38] <quackgyver> and there's literally zero documentation about what to specify
[16:45:41] <quackgyver> which is idiotic
[16:47:07] <robertmaxrees> there's an sdk_key that you pass to the _500px.init() method
[16:47:24] <quackgyver> yes
[16:47:30] <quackgyver> i did
[16:50:00] <quackgyver> uh
[16:50:02] <quackgyver> suddenly it works
[16:50:03] <quackgyver> wtf
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> caching maybe?
[16:53:42] <quackgyver> yeah maybe, who knows. :/
[16:53:57] <robertmaxrees> that's probably what is was.
[16:55:31] <quackgyver> yeah
[16:55:35] <quackgyver> well, thanks for all the help
[16:55:38] <quackgyver> appreciate you taking the time
[16:57:06] <pauled> robertmaxrees: this is correct? http://jsfiddle.net/92kyzec0/
[16:57:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:57:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't just run .toggleClass("foo"); randomly.
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to tell it "on what".
[16:57:51] <robertmaxrees> in this case, $(this)
[16:58:05] <pauled> but its on $("a").
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> right, $(this) is the element that was clicked.
[16:58:26] <robertmaxrees> or changed, rather.
[16:58:36] <robertmaxrees> even those anchor tags don't fire a change event.
[16:59:44] <pauled> the <a> example is inappropriate?
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> the <a> tag doesn't have a change event unless you manually trigger it
[17:01:11] <pauled> the I could switch .change() to .hover() or a element to another like checkbox?
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> back up - what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[17:01:54] <pauled> nothing, just to understand how to create function in that case
[17:02:13] <robertmaxrees> traditionally you'd use .click() for that example.
[17:02:15] <robertmaxrees> or .on('click'
[17:02:46] <pauled> ok
[17:08:39] <pauled> robertmaxrees: why it show duplicate value here: https://jsfiddle.net/gL86wr54/1/
[17:11:32] <pauled> updated https://jsfiddle.net/gL86wr54/2/
[17:12:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "show duplicate value here"?
[17:12:53] <pauled> if i select one, it shwo twice
[17:13:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not getting that
[17:13:24] <pauled> example for chocolate selected: Chocolate
[17:13:24] <pauled>  Chocolate
[17:13:43] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/s42pvjE.png
[17:14:37] <robertmaxrees> also do this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gL86wr54/3/
[17:15:34] <pauled> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/L3YsKRz.png
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm got getting that at all.
[17:16:04] <pauled> weird then :)
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> check my last fiddle though
[17:17:15] <pauled> http://i.imgur.com/YXqI0pZ.png
[17:17:18] <pauled> same
[17:17:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:18:33] <pauled> yeah weird
[17:19:22] <pauled> hmm it work in private browsing :D
[17:20:04] <pauled> http://i.imgur.com/EO7w8bz.png
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's a problem with that weird theme you're running.
[17:20:54] <pauled> deluminate
[17:21:05] <pauled> ...extension
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.
[17:21:57] <pauled> yeah it's deluminate fault
[17:24:14] <pauled> I will report bug
[17:24:42] <pauled> https://github.com/abstiles/deluminate/issues
[17:36:48] <pauled> hmmm same on codepen.io
[17:36:56] <pauled> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNZJKW
[17:37:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's your extension.
[17:37:46] <pauled> http://i.imgur.com/ZRwlPxc.png
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> that's your extension again.
[17:37:58] <pauled> I would like to test in pure js
[17:38:26] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:39:22] <pauled> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[17:39:42] <pauled> cheers \o/ :)
[17:46:45] <pauled> hmm maybe because iframe
[17:50:58] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[17:51:05] <pauled> robertmaxrees: which browser you use? chrome don't have an option to open iframe in another tab
[17:55:53] <robertmaxrees> firefox.
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> but the iframe stuff for those tools isn't that simple iirc.
[18:00:18] <pauled> yes the result is always automatically embedded in iframe
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> right.

[19:42:38] <nomad411> How can I target that specific section ?
[19:43:51] <nomad411> If I understand this, do I replace "P" here with section  ?   I,d have to target only this one..  $( "p" ).addClass( "myClass yourClass" );

[23:40:52] <ussher_> Whats it called when you hover over one div and another one shows?  Been looking for a 'flyout' jquery plugin but not finding it.  Like http://www.templatemonster.com/  when you hover over a design to get more info.  Is there a name for that?
[23:43:38] <SaptakS_> I want to contribute to jquery. What are the things that I should do?
[23:44:06] <FilipNortic> ussher_: tooltip?

[23:45:39] <FilipNortic> what has happend to the bot?
[23:45:50] <Cork> happend to it?
[23:46:26] <FilipNortic> some one couldn't find ajax in api  and the beauty tip seemed random
[23:46:40] <ussher_> yeah dont think I would have thought to search on 'beauty tip' but thats what i'm after.  thanks Cork
[23:46:52] <Cork> FilipNortic: <Cork> ?g beautytip => Beauty Tips
[23:46:57] <Cork> its a google search
[23:47:01] <Cork> not random :)

[23:47:35] <Cork> ussher_: ya, i use that one a lot
[23:47:48] <FilipNortic> ahh I missed the g
[23:47:49] <Cork> though heavily modified (it is a bit buggy originally)
[23:48:25] <Cork> would be interesting implementing it again based purely on svg
[23:48:29] <Uhkis> ?g qtip2
[23:48:30] <b-ot> Uhkis: qTip2 - Pretty powerful tooltips → http://qtip2.com/
[23:49:40] <ussher_> yep, qtip would work too.  once you know what to look for there's heaps.  I couldn't think of anything other than 'flyout'. mental block.
[23:49:58] <Uhkis> :)
[23:50:22] <Cork> i think jquery ui has one too
[23:50:27] <Cork> ?g jquery ui tooltip
[23:50:28] <b-ot> Cork: Tooltip | jQuery UI → https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[23:51:39] <Uhkis> there's soooo many tooltip plugins for jquery
[23:51:45] <Cork> ya
[23:52:08] <Cork> if i implemented a custom tooltip lib today i would prob use the one in ui
[23:52:28] <jb0t> i need to capture onunload or onbeforeunload and fire an ajax payload to indicate a disconnect from the page.  it seems like this is wildly inconsistent across browsers. ios in particular seems like I can only get it done with on pagehide AND with the ajax in sync mode, which is deprecated as of 1.8. anybody got resources or info on how to handle this definitively across all browsers?
[23:53:10] <Cork> jb0t: what i would do is use websocket
[23:53:17] <Cork> and register when the connection is closed
[23:53:26] <Cork> you can't depend on unload/beforeunload
[23:53:43] <Cork> and browsers are thinking about killing the event
[23:53:52] <Cork> cause too many pages uses it to extort users
[23:55:01] <Uhkis> whoever had the idea of "prevent this page for displaying more dialogs" is a genius
[23:55:24] <jb0t> i'll look into that. i'm using websockets now but I don't think I saw any binding for close with the libs i'm using
[23:55:27] <Cork> i think chrome was the first to implement it
[23:55:30] <Cork> possibly opera
[23:55:50] <Cork> jb0t: well i use it directly
[23:56:17] <Cork> jb0t: and you get a socket closed error when it is unexpectedly closed
[23:56:36] <Cork> (or a special "i'm closing this connection now" event)
[23:58:44] <jb0t> i'm sure socket.io is providing the event. looking through source of this lib to see if it fields it
[23:59:00] <Cork> i use go
[23:59:16] <Cork> or gorilla to be exact
