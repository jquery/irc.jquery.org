[00:02:30] <gaurav_sood91> hi all. i am trying to use the jqGrid plugin for grails application, to retrieve the data in a table in grid format. i am unable to get the grid working though. any ideas?
[00:03:34] <raj> gaurav_sood91, need more info about how its not working
[00:03:39] <raj> also, show some code if you can
[00:03:50] <gaurav_sood91> raj: i'll just paste the code
[00:03:57] <raj> in a pastebin
[00:04:56] <gaurav_sood91> raj: http://pastebin.com/z8auwjF9
[00:05:11] <marandi> hi guys , i fill an id with jquery ( ajax with .html ) , and then i make a listner to when that class a tags click do somethings but even listener wont work , what shoud i do ?
[00:06:27] <Whirl3d> marandi, you need to build the click handler and then attach it to a parent element (that doesn't change with the ajax request). Anything in the child elements bubbles up and gets handled by the persistent parent element
[00:06:53] <gaurav_sood91> raj: the method in the controller class: http://pastebin.com/ft9DWNuU
[00:06:56] <Whirl3d> so $("parent").on("click", "tagclass", function (e) { handle the click here});
[00:07:30] <marandi> Whirl3d: i dont know whats tagclass , i know it would be a tag !
[00:07:45] <Whirl3d> where "parent" is actually some way of referencing the permanent container and "tagclass" is the selector for your anchor elements
[00:08:01] <gaurav_sood91> raj: am not getting any errors, though not getting any output either
[00:08:03] <marandi> Whirl3d: all right , let me check
[00:08:12] <Whirl3d> what class or id does the thing that you want to select?
[00:09:11] <fRAiLtY-> is it possible in query to get the boolean value of a php variable? I have 3 values set on my page $rule1,2,3 and want to use jQuery to ascertain whether they're true/false and act accordingly
[00:09:52] <Whirl3d> how do you mean "values set on the page"
[00:11:28] <Cork> raj: those should be about the same
[00:11:35] <marandi> Whirl3d: worked :D yay ,. thanks dude , btw , why .on isnt in the functions list in jquery
[00:12:03] <Whirl3d> it's jquery 1..7
[00:12:44] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/on
[00:13:05] <Cork> and http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-handler-attachment/
[00:13:24] <Whirl3d> nice...gotta bookmark that one. LOL
[00:15:49] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you have to store the value either in html or in js
[00:16:12] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: php data is server side, so its not accessible to client side
[00:20:13] <Industrial> How do I chech if $(this) is the third child in it.s parent() ?
[00:20:27] <Whirl3d> .index()
[00:20:31] <Industrial> okay
[00:21:15] <Whirl3d> var isThird=$(this).index()==2;
[00:22:27] <Whirl3d> does anyone have a suggestion for an opensource wysiwyg text editor that I could expand?
[00:23:23] <NodeX> I use CKeditor
[00:23:34] <NodeX> it's opensource iirc and you can expand it with plugins
[00:23:38] <Whirl3d> I have to make a conversation tool that allows styles and formatting of text by the user, but also allows "special" notation designed to facilitate branching, topic change, etc.
[00:23:52] <Whirl3d> NodeX, thanks. I'll check it out.
[00:24:07] <NodeX> it's a little buggy in places but highly configurable
[00:29:38] <gaurav_sood91> raj: got any bug in the code?
[00:33:05] <DwarfSmasher> is "var elm = $('#element'); $(elm).html(); " equivalent to another dome request? or it cached?
[00:35:54] <thomedy> okay earlier some one told me i had to mouse enter events they foud it through the console..
[00:36:00] <thomedy> i have never tried this but here we go
[00:36:37] <thomedy> DwarfSasher that is an incredibally relavent question
[00:36:48] <thomedy> i just finished changing all of my () to var thing = ()
[00:36:51] <thomedy> whatever variable
[00:36:55] <thomedy> is that caching your js
[00:37:03] <thomedy> i was told its more efficient
[00:37:33] <thomedy> i only did it to elements in which i call the elmement more than once
[00:43:51] <thomedy> is anyone working right now
[00:44:14] <coldhead> i sure am
[00:44:17] <coldhead> like a dog
[00:44:20] <thomedy> oh good evening
[00:44:44] <thomedy> what part of the world are you in cuz its probably not true that your doing an all  night like me cuz your probably a successful dev already
[00:44:54] <thomedy> while however am playing the make it game
[00:45:34] <thomedy> im trying to figure out what i can do to smooth out my animations
[00:45:42] <thomedy> i just switched all my () to var = ()
[00:45:48] <thomedy> if that makes sense
[00:45:51] <coldhead> i am in sydney
[00:45:55] <thomedy> it has def helped
[00:46:07] <thomedy> well then what is it good morning ?
[00:46:14] <thomedy> good something to you
[00:46:16] <coldhead> evening
[00:46:23] <thomedy> its 3am for me
[00:46:27] <thomedy> anyway
[00:46:45] <coldhead> thomedy: if you read the logs for a couple hours ago you will find gnarf making some suggestions on improving animations http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120704.log.html
[00:47:06] <coldhead> ack, it was the previous log http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120703.log.html
[00:47:15] <coldhead> it's just passed midnight wherever the logs live
[00:47:44] <coldhead> discussion with blendedbychris
[00:48:23] <thomedy> oh great
[00:48:24] <thomedy> thank you
[00:48:43] <thomedy> i was reading  apost someone sent to me on debuggin my own js
[00:48:49] <thomedy> but i will do that
[00:49:24] <wathek> Hi everybody
[00:49:37] <wathek> how would you do to make an image rotator using the mouse ?
[00:52:45] <Whirl3d> I would like to make the logs easier to reference. Is there any way to grab the html from the logs, manipulate it with jquery and present it differently?  From another domain?
[00:53:39] <Whirl3d> wathek, could you please read your question and ponder it for a second. How could anyone answer that question....you need to provide more details
[00:54:23] <thomedy> its probably my fault but i couldnt find what he was suggesting in the logs im sorry
[00:54:37] <thomedy> and imn kinda saddened by that cuz i read the part about him being a core contrib to jquery
[00:54:43] <wathek> Whirl3d, let's say I have an image when the user hover it an icon will be shown to let the user rotate the image
[00:54:43] <thomedy> so i was eager to learn
[00:55:00] <pawn> UI Draggables: How do I make position properties us percentages instead of pixels?
[00:55:41] <Cork> pawn: calculated css values always use pixels
[00:56:01] <Cork> or rather computed css values always use
[00:56:26] <Whirl3d> wathek, you could use css and the :hover attribute to add a background image to your element indicating that it was rotatable
[00:58:58] <Whirl3d> sorry, the :hover pseudo selector..
[00:59:39] <wathek> I see I need to get the mouse position first and convert that to an angle to use with css
[01:00:22] <anli_> Is it possible to define a js file in jsfiddle so I can use it with <script src="foo.js"></script>?
[01:00:58] <Whirl3d> so you want the icon to point to the pointer?
[01:01:36] <Whirl3d> yes. on the left-panel there's an ADD Resources button
[01:01:52] <anli_> Yes, but I have to specify an url
[01:01:55] <wathek> Whirl3d, i want the icon to let the user rotate the image when he maintains click and mouse moving
[01:01:59] <Whirl3d> you can add your resources to make them available by entering a url there. Does that help
[01:02:06] <anli_> wanna upload
[01:02:16] <anli_> So the js file is part of the fiddle
[01:02:31] <Whirl3d> so you can edit it?
[01:02:44] <Whirl3d> or just so it's features are usable
[01:02:45] <anli_> No, so it will be in the fiddle without depending on another server
[01:02:53] <Whirl3d> no
[01:03:04] <Whirl3d> unless you paste it in into the js part
[01:03:21] <Whirl3d> wathek, so you want to click-drag rotate, right?
[01:03:28] <wathek> Whirl3d, that's that
[01:03:43] <anli_> I can always comment out the <script> tag that includes the js, then I add a comment in the javascript section telling that the content is from a certain js file
[01:04:41] <Whirl3d> so your question then is what anli_?
[01:05:25] <thomedy> cold head you wouldnt by any chance have seen what gnarf said did you
[01:05:30] <thomedy> cuz i couldn't find his post
[01:07:22] <tw2113> http://jmarbach.com/solve-problems-dont-build-ideas
[01:07:24] <tw2113> :D
[01:11:22] <some_dude> what's a good IDE that works with jquery and PHP, I mean autocomplete, debugging etc. Please don't say Netbeans
[01:11:37] <anli_> How do I include the js that is in the javascript section in jsfiddle?
[01:12:17] <IamTrying> i have a: body> iframe>contents and button1<iframe   </body>  how can i on button1 press inside iframe reload the main page?
[01:12:45] <Whirl3d> thomedy, though I think you will agree that you are really looking for ways to avoid getting your project done by pursuing the noble taks of "learning", you can get all the past logs at http://irc.jquery.com   there should be plenty to keep you distracted.
[01:13:07] <IamTrying> WTF
[01:13:23] <wwwicked> some_dude: Eclipse works for me (for PHP). You can set it up for interactive debugging using xdebug. To be honest, I haven't tried anything else to compare it against. For debugging Javascript I tend to use the browser tools. Dunno if there's a jQuery autocomplete plugin for Eclipse
[01:13:33] <Whirl3d> IamTrying, same domain?
[01:14:52] <Whirl3d> some_dude, I use Aptana 2.0 and the jquery plugin. It's not the most up to date and it's built on eclipse, but it works pretty well for me. Shoky would suggest webstorm, I believe..
[01:15:01] <some_dude> wwwicked: I use netbeans and it's good for PHP. the problem is when I got php and html/js on the same page  autocomplete/highlighting/semantic check stops working..
[01:17:26] <thomedy> okay it died here did nt it
[01:18:00] <Whirl3d> what died?
[01:18:35] <Whirl3d> is that what stinks so bad?
[01:18:40] <Jeroenem> Hey folks, I'm trying to add some share functionality to my collectionpage. Each item has it's own link so it can be shared. I dont want to add the actual sharing icons to each item, but want them to have only 1 time on the entire page. I need jquery to toggle these share icons on hover, set their position on the share button i've hovered on, and then add the specific link to the icons... I'm
[01:18:40] <Jeroenem> stuck on the position and updating the URLs.. any help is appreciated. Heres a visual preview: http://i46.tinypic.com/2d97lah.jpg
[01:20:50] <Guest11434> guys   jquery change() event fires only when i click outside the textarea ,  how do i make that change event to fire without clicking outside the textarea ?
[01:21:09] <Whirl3d> Jeroenem, if you paste your code so far to jsfiddle.net (include CSS, Js, and HTML in the appropriately labeled panels, select Jquery 1.72 from the left dropdown) and click save...then share the URL back here it will be the most likely way to get help.
[01:22:02] <Whirl3d> Guest11434, you can manually fire the event using "trigger" on kepress or something, but Change only happens when the value changes and the element loses focus.
[01:22:31] <Guest11434> that is weird - change should work while maintaining focus
[01:22:40] <Guest11434> jquery should modify this event
[01:22:57] <thomedy> whirl3d... im sure you can help me if your not too busy... which i will respect if so... but i looked for the advice gnarf gave earlier i couldn't find itl...
[01:23:02] <thomedy> i think i cached my js
[01:23:05] <thomedy> if thats what i did
[01:23:10] <thomedy> but i still have a jumpy animation
[01:23:34] <thomedy> i read something about px vs %
[01:23:45] <thomedy> but i have both and i dont know if thats my prob
[01:23:54] <thomedy> i think my main prob is i dont know my prob
[01:24:05] <thomedy> so i have been googling randomly
[01:24:06] <Whirl3d> did you search through th e longs
[01:24:12] <thomedy> i lost the link
[01:24:13] <thomedy> but yes
[01:24:20] <Whirl3d> irc.jquery.com
[01:24:24] <thomedy> i googled and then ctrl f to find his name/my name
[01:24:29] <thomedy> i coudn't find any connection
[01:24:55] <Whirl3d> if I find it, you know I'm gonna give you shit. Mostly because you CAN do this yourself. LOL
[01:25:05] <thomedy> im back there
[01:25:11] <thomedy> and if you do i derserver the shit
[01:25:18] <thomedy> im on the log again
[01:25:23] <thomedy> ctrl f time
[01:25:26] <thomedy> its a race
[01:28:32] <Whirl3d> I think that coldhead was referring to gnarf offering general advice for animation, not just to you, but in general...
[01:29:27] <Whirl3d> Jeroenem, you still around?
[01:30:02] <thomedy> okay that would be why i didn't see it
[01:30:12] <thomedy> i am still looking
[01:30:23] <thomedy> is it caching your js to turn ()'s into var = ()
[01:30:30] <Jeroenem> Whirl3d you're right, i pasted the markup in a jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/qfHGu/
[01:30:33] <thomedy> obviously thats not the actuall code
[01:32:58] <Whirl3d> Jeroenem, what I would do is setup your share toolbar markup and hide it. Then use the .on handler to handle the "mouseenter" event to show the same toolbar over each "share" button with the data from that div...i'll see if I can do it in your fiddle
[01:37:32] <mindis|wurk> hm, is it possible to manipulate the scroll position of a select element? i'd like it to position itself so that the current selection is as close to the top as possible when the dropdown opens
[01:38:03] <mindis|wurk> by default it's as close to the bottom as it can get
[01:38:50] <Jeroenem> Whirl3d that would be awesome, i will dig into the .on handler
[01:46:47] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you could try fiddle with the select elements members
[01:47:01] <Cork> it might have a scrollTop property
[01:47:09] <Cork> but my guess would be no, you can't
[01:47:46] <mindis|wurk> that's the feeling i got from googling it. webtech is particularily pathetic when it comes to form elements
[01:48:27] <thomedy> okay so i read from the logs that stop() will smooth out an animation but im already running that however my animation is not quite smooth
[01:49:18] <Whirl3d> thomedy, is it up to date right now?
[01:49:41] <Cork> mindis|wurk: ya, all the rules only says "os native" and that REALLY suck
[01:50:17] <Whirl3d> are you using the transit.js plugin?
[01:52:57] <Jeroenem> Whirl3d how do you suggest to get the right position for the share icons? the panel that shows up when you mouseenter a share button?
[01:53:48] <Whirl3d> soryr, still working on a fullfeatured solution. But use .offset and have the single toolbar positioned absolutely on the dom
[01:53:53] <Whirl3d> body element
[01:55:02] <Jeroenem> oh, great :) thanks. I will also look up for some information on .offset :)
[02:00:00] <thomedy> okay how can i use the firebug to debug an animation
[02:00:06] <thomedy> do i console .animate and the element
[02:00:19] <thomedy> or wiat i can step through i think
[02:06:54] <thomedy> okay... im officially going to ask... not for an answer or solution
[02:06:56] <thomedy> but what to look up
[02:07:07] <thomedy> i cannot figure out how to make my animation smoother at all
[02:08:58] <Whirl3d> transit.js
[02:12:50] <thomedy> whirl3d is that something for me to look up
[02:12:56] <thomedy> i hope so
[02:13:23] <thomedy> my goal is to learn how to correct the animation myself instead of continously building plugins but i guess i could learn from it
[02:15:27] <raj> can I not test to see if two dom elements are the same element with ===?
[02:15:34] <Cork> sure
[02:15:36] <raj> using jquery selectors
[02:15:41] <Cork> yes and no
[02:15:53] <Cork> $('elm1')[0] == $('elm2')[0]
[02:16:01] <Cork> you can't do $('elm1') == $('elm2')
[02:16:10] <raj> i was doing === in fact
[02:16:19] <Cork> == or === doesn't matter in this case
[02:16:22] <raj> k
[02:16:23] <Cork> but ya you should use ===
[02:16:32] <raj> what's wrong with your second example?
[02:16:35] <thomedy> cork what is $('elm')[] i get that its an array but what is the elements in an array of  dom element
[02:16:39] <raj> oh, i can't test if arrays are same?
[02:16:56] <Cork> $() creates an object, and two different objects won't have the same identifier
[02:17:13] <thomedy> can i use pointers in js
[02:17:24] <Cork> $()[] returns the raw dom element, and its garanteed to be the same for the same element
[02:17:24] <thomedy> cuz i think identifier = pointer but prob not ===
[02:17:37] <thomedy> okay...
[02:17:47] <Whirl3d> thomedy than do you animations in css, not jquery
[02:17:48] <Cork> thomedy: no, js doens't have pointers
[02:17:59] <thomedy> whirl3d i can do that
[02:18:01] <Cork> thomedy: though you can send references :)
[02:18:02] <Whirl3d> that's what transit does for you
[02:18:13] <thomedy> thats fine i can learn from transit
[02:18:22] <Whirl3d> and it provides a fallback to jquery for non-css3 compliant browsers
[02:18:32] <thomedy> im well beyond doing things the ard way now as long as i can get what i want and learn the correct way
[02:18:35] <thomedy> then everything is fine
[02:18:50] <Whirl3d> the correct way is to use transit.js.
[02:19:18] <raj> got it, thanks Cork
[02:19:44] <raj> Cork, https://gist.github.com/21770cc55bdaca1f99bf
[02:19:45] <raj> :)
[02:20:01] <raj> actually, that is probably bad for my efficiency mantra
[02:20:08] <raj> i'll just [0] instead
[02:21:22] <Whirl3d> jesus christ I spend 60% of my time debugging missing ) or }  for some stupid reason
[02:22:31] <Cork> raj: just use filter
[02:22:37] * Zhy pats Whirl3d on the back
[02:23:57] <Grundell> Whirl3d - that is sad....
[02:24:02] <toxz> has anyone an idea how this is possible??? http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg341/scaled.php?server=341&filename=76967542.png&res=landing
[02:24:23] <toxz> i cant see the mistake
[02:24:45] <raj> Cork, if those two elements match, I want to add a class to another element
[02:24:52] <raj> not sure filter would work there?
[02:25:05] <Cork> ha, nope
[02:25:14] <Cork> *ah
[02:25:23] <raj> laughing at me!
[02:25:32] <raj> :)
[02:25:34] <Cork> :D
[02:26:31] <Grundell> guys is there a smart way to include php inside javascrip tags ?
[02:26:56] <sente> err
[02:26:59] <Cork> Grundell: include php???
[02:27:05] <Cork> you can't include php
[02:27:16] <Cork> you can run php and echo content to the script tag
[02:27:42] <Cork> if you want to call php from js you need to use ajax
[02:27:44] <Grundell> Cork - That's what i ment... how do i do that the best way?
[02:28:15] <Cork> Grundell: you want to dynamically generate js or, just output value to the js?
[02:28:25] <Grundell> Cork - okay, as a totall jQuery / ajax noob is there a tutorial for how i could do this ?
[02:28:51] <Grundell> I want to have a dynamic text depending on what language of the site you're browsing
[02:29:02] <Cork> ah
[02:29:17] <Cork> Grundell: my recomendation would be to store that in an array
[02:29:20] <Cork> or object
[02:29:35] <Cork> and create the js container through json_encode
[02:29:53] <Cork> var translation = <?php echo json_encode; ?>;
[02:30:07] <Whirl3d> Jeroenem, try something like this: it's ugly and could be done better, but it will get ya started. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qfHGu/26/
[02:30:20] <Grundell> Okay. is there a smart little turtorial on how i can do this on the internet ?
[02:30:35] <Cork> it should be quite straight forward
[02:30:44] <Cork> no don't think theres a tutorial for it
[02:33:03] <Grundell> Cork - as i never coded in jQuery / ajax / java before yestarday... i really would need something more tha it's straight forward :P
[02:34:14] <toxz> is this possible? http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg341/scaled.php?server=341&filename=76967542.png&res=landing
[02:35:04] <sente> if imageshack.us still exists
[02:35:07] <sente> anything is possible
[02:35:39] <toxz> you cant see the image?
[02:36:08] <sente> no i can
[02:36:12] <toxz> imageshack.us still exists
[02:36:46] <datarecal> I am trying to create a menu slider http://jsfiddle.net/MMvse/ but it seems that the image is being stretched across the entire width of the slide, I need to get full html code inside this slide not just one image
[02:37:18] <toxz> ok another try - http://i.minus.com/iJokmG9YgRhoB.png
[02:37:20] <Grundell> Cork - Think I'm a hoples case ?
[02:40:17] <datarecal> slider one is the one with the image and the <h1>awesome</h1> the rest dont have images
[02:40:28] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[02:40:48] <thomedy> its probably me and the fact that im tryiung to pull another all nighter but i got an error just incorporating jquery.transit.js
[02:40:59] <raj> goodnight peoples
[02:41:04] <toxz> sente - can u see it now?
[02:41:15] <thomedy> dang it i need this to be smoother
[02:43:03] <sente> toxz: http://sentedrop.com/uploads/2012-07-04/foo.png
[02:43:08] <sente> looks quite possible...
[02:43:43] <toxz> thx ill take a looj
[02:43:45] <toxz> look
[02:48:01] <toxz> sente - why you have properties in the object when doing foo = new Object(); ?
[02:50:15] <sente> toxz: i made an object
[02:50:26] <sente> and then added properties
[02:50:47] <toxz> ah ok - so there a some lines missing!?
[02:50:50] <sente> in order to demonstrate to you that your screenshot is reasonable
[02:51:33] <toxz> can you send me the whole test-script`?
[02:51:34] <sente> no, the javascript console keeps references
[02:51:48] <sente> foo=new Object()
[02:51:52] <sente> foo.town=Array[4]
[02:51:57] <pflock> If I have a style-tag in my html and I see in the sourcecode of the browser (so it is loaded), but all the css-properties aren't loaded at all, what to do?
[02:52:03] <sente> foo.func=document.getElementsById
[02:52:26] <sente> console.log(foo);console.log(foo.func);console.log(foo.town);console.log("its simple");
[02:52:38] <sente> getElementById, not getElementsById
[02:55:17] <toxz> sente - so that means that the console output is wrong?
[02:55:39] <sente> toxz: no it means you dont understand
[02:55:47] <toxz> yes thats right
[02:55:51] <toxz> :-)
[02:55:54] <toxz> i try ti
[02:55:56] <toxz> to
[02:57:25] <sente> http://i.imgur.com/ilf4M.png
[02:58:08] <Jeroenem> Whirl3d thanks! Thats great :) this points me in the right direction
[02:58:15] <toxz> sente - http://jsfiddle.net/XueYu/1/
[02:58:26] <Chel> question: is this a right channel for jquery ui ?
[02:58:37] <toxz> yeah i have that, but i dont understand why town is undefined
[03:00:16] <Whirl3d> toz, Array[4] does not create an array of four elements.
[03:00:29] <sente> toxz: all functions are 'undefined' if yo try and log them
[03:00:34] <sente> console.log(console.log);
[03:00:36] <sente> console.log(alert);
[03:00:39] <Whirl3d> It looks for the fourth element in the Array variable.
[03:00:44] <sente> console.log(<anyfunction>)
[03:00:54] <sente> also note, when you define a function, it says 'undefined'
[03:01:13] <Whirl3d> Chel, you can ask your jqueryui question here and we'll help if we can
[03:01:38] <toxz> sente - Whirl3d is right  - http://jsfiddle.net/XueYu/2/
[03:01:48] <sente> http://i.imgur.com/VOwxG.png
[03:02:39] <sente> toxz: well, right... but your example
[03:02:56] <Chel> question: i have div > ul html. i run $(div).dialog({}) and ul tag gets css style opacity: 0.2; cant find why
[03:02:59] <bitiic> hi, is there any function of jquery make a self click in a banner? the src of the banner is a php file, so i can't know the link it generates
[03:03:06] <toxz> sente - ah ok you wanted to have a function not an array on town!?
[03:03:19] <Whirl3d> toxz, also the preferred syntax when creating an array is [];     var thelist=[];    or    var theList=[1,2,3]; just fyi..
[03:04:07] <Whirl3d> bitiic, you attach a handler to the click event using .on on a parent container...
[03:04:29] <sente> toxz: i was just copying your example...
[03:04:30] <Whirl3d> so if your banner elements are in a div called "bannerHolder", you would use:
[03:04:38] <bitiic> i am new the jquery so i think i will need a bit more of detail :s
[03:05:20] <Whirl3d> $("#bannerHolder").on(""click", ".bannerItemClass", function (e) { do what you need to for the click on that banner});
[03:05:43] <bitiic> but this is for the user to click on it right?
[03:06:00] <toxz> sente - ah yeah - now i see the fault
[03:06:03] <bitiic> i need the link of the banner is clicked by itself to avoid ask the user to click it
[03:06:16] <toxz> i always thought its an array with length 3
[03:06:28] <toxz> but its a call to get element 3 of the array...
[03:06:43] <Whirl3d> that reads like this: Select the dom element element with the ID of "bannerHolder" and handle all of the click events for it's children of class "bannerItem"...
[03:07:16] <shoky> er. functions aren't undefined, yo
[03:07:26] <bitiic> the code is like that: <iframe src="http://web.com/banner.php"></iframe>
[03:07:43] <Whirl3d> can't help ya there. Sorry.
[03:07:44] <bitiic> so when this code is read a banner appears, and a link for it
[03:08:02] <Whirl3d> <--doesn't use iframes
[03:08:04] <bitiic> all i need is know if there exist any way to self click on it
[03:08:07] <toxz> sente - i think thats the reason - thx a lot man!!!
[03:08:17] <bitiic> well is the code the pay for click web gave me...
[03:08:45] <sente> toxz: sorry i wasn't more clear
[03:08:48] <sente> glad to have helped
[03:08:49] <Whirl3d> shoky! good morning
[03:09:03] <shoky> mornin` sir
[03:09:40] <thomedy> i hate that im getting no where
[03:10:24] <shoky> i've been no where for a long time now
[03:10:38] <thomedy> every time i try a recommended plug in i get a $ not defined or a something which means im calling my scripts in the wrong order or am using an out of date jquery but im so tired and i just want to be done
[03:10:57] <Whirl3d> thomedy you say that until you find yourself in a really bad place. then you'll wish you  were nowhere
[03:10:58] <thomedy> by the way shoky i cached everything
[03:11:06] <shoky> then stop using drupal that makes you use jquery 1.3.2 :(
[03:11:24] <Whirl3d> amen!
[03:11:32] <thomedy> im all for that right now but honeslty theres no real way i could do a solid store with out it i think im not good enough at php
[03:11:54] <thomedy> i can do php but i dont know anythign about security or apis to paypall and i would be so much farther behind then i am
[03:12:01] <thomedy> in the future though i dont know
[03:12:18] <thomedy> cuz i like coding myself
[03:12:29] <shoky> well, as i recall, the lastest drupal at least has jquery 1.5 or something
[03:12:33] <shoky> why not upgrade
[03:13:03] <thomedy> okay let me figure out how to do that.. my original attempt was loose the jquery from drupal and bring in the most recent
[03:13:07] <thomedy> it didn't work
[03:13:18] <thomedy> but im probably out of my mind at this point
[03:13:23] <shoky> that shit is too tightly coupled
[03:13:39] <thomedy> okay let me see what i can do
[03:13:48] <shoky> did you at least get some, after your 'date'
[03:13:56] <Whirl3d> and thomedy, this is so you can pick up clients for whom you plan to do more of this? in addition to your 4 jobs...ouch
[03:15:47] <mink> Hello :)   I know it's maybe very stupid question, but can I use in jquery function looks like     ->     $('.elementByClass').ready(function(){         alert("foo");         });          ?
[03:16:07] <Whirl3d> ?tias
[03:16:10] <bot-t> Try It And See
[03:16:42] <shoky> sweet! http://sqlfiddle.com/
[03:16:55] <mink> Whirl3d, I tried and it works, but I don't know it is correct or not?
[03:17:49] <mink> I don't know how check, it's correctly or not
[03:17:53] <Whirl3d> mink, it works because it is correct
[03:18:09] <shoky> mink: it doesn't make a lot of sense though
[03:18:17] <shoky> use $(document).ready(...
[03:18:26] <thomedy> shoky... nope... kids
[03:18:27] <thomedy> ha ha
[03:18:37] <shoky> lul ;>
[03:19:18] <niels__> what's the smartest screen capture app for os x? pref with sound recording as well.
[03:20:08] <thomedy> i feel so defeated right now
[03:21:11] <Whirl3d> just shut your trap and get some sleep. Honestly you'll feel better in the morning...
[03:21:25] <Whirl3d> <--said with love, mind you
[03:21:56] <thomedy> i have to be uup in about an hor for work anyway theres no point
[03:22:18] <thomedy> i just dont have enough time to sleep
[03:22:42] <thomedy> i hate my jobs and as soon as i can quit i will
[03:22:42] <Whirl3d> that's not true. Trust me I am an expert at no sleep. Hell I ain't slept in years...15 minutes of shuteye will do you a great deal fo good.Learn TM--it's amazing
[03:23:12] <thomedy> yeah but 15 min wont be 15 im  notorious for not hearing my alarm clock
[03:23:14] * sente seconds that
[03:24:26] <Whirl3d> just so long as you aren't a nurse or brain surgeon or something where people's lives depend on your alertness. That or maybe you have a good meth source, but even that has it's problems. LOL
[03:24:52] * sente seconds that
[03:25:15] <Whirl3d> but don't talk yourself into a bad day, feeling defeated because of sleep deprivation. I have been here watching you work on this site for a while and your are doing great
[03:27:26] <thomedy> thank you very much
[03:27:30] <thomedy> i do appreciate it
[03:27:59] <thomedy> brb
[03:28:10] <thomedy> i gotta excuse myself for little boy time
[03:28:40] <Whirl3d> I hope that's not what it sounds like. LOL bye for now.
[03:28:50] <cusco> hi
[03:29:03] <Whirl3d> hi cusco.
[03:29:57] <cusco> I'm using .append()
[03:30:16] <cusco> to have a <select> being populated with <option>'s
[03:30:27] <cusco> how do I make them selected, when appended?
[03:31:06] <thomedy> i had to potty
[03:32:13] <Whirl3d> add the "selected" attribute to the html for your options, cusco
[03:32:28] <cusco> ah dooh, ok its html
[03:32:30] <cusco> sorry
[03:32:41] <Whirl3d> <option selected value='test'>test</option>
[03:34:47] <arminrosu> I'm trying to catch a redirect on an ajax call
[03:35:00] <arminrosu> (i.e. getting an url with ajax, that gets redirected)
[03:35:28] <arminrosu> I'd like to know the redirected url before getting more data
[03:35:32] <arminrosu> is that possible?
[03:38:08] <twoface> Hi. I'm trying to use jquery.scrollfollow.js on elements in a table, but the cells heights are "wrong". Inspecting the cells with chrome developer tools does reveal a larger box than the cell itself. An example can be seen at http://jsfiddle.net/fCmKZ/5/ - how can I get the "real" height of the cells?
[03:41:28] <toxz> sente - unfortunately it wasnt the solution
[03:43:00] <romario333> Hi, does jQuery UI have support for doing client-side validations?
[03:44:53] <X-Raimo> Hello, I have AJAX request. http://paste.org.ru/?dzjjjy Server replies with JSON but parsing gives null
[03:46:14] <X-Raimo> Server response is: {"reply":"0"}
[03:46:46] <NodeX> what is the header from the server ?
[03:46:53] <NodeX> response header*
[03:47:22] <twoface> X-Raimo, with dataType: 'json', isn't the data variable already a javascript object?
[03:47:44] <X-Raimo> twoface: I dunno
[03:47:54] <twoface> well... check? :)
[03:48:02] <NodeX> What is the RESPONSE header from the server?
[03:48:20] <thomedy> well i quit
[03:48:31] <sente> toxz: i didn't even know your.. problme
[03:48:39] <X-Raimo> NodeX: [14:46] <X-Raimo> Server response is: {"reply":"0"}
[03:49:23] <X-Raimo> twoface: You was right. Thanx
[03:50:21] <toxz> sente - you want to know it? :-)
[03:50:45] <sente> toxz: sure
[03:50:55] <toxz> sente - thx
[03:51:54] <NodeX> X-Raimo : the header
[03:52:00] <NodeX> response header*
[03:52:05] <toxz> again the screenshot - http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg341/scaled.php?server=341&filename=76967542.png&res=landing - but Array[3] means an array with length 3 not x.plugins = Array[3] like you wrote it in your example
[03:52:36] <X-Raimo> is jQuery provide more easier way to create JSON, then using: http://paste.org.ru/?vht20v
[03:53:04] <NodeX> what's so hard about that?>
[03:53:30] <X-Raimo> NodeX: response headers: http://paste.org.ru/?kvjspg
[03:53:41] <NodeX> you're sending usernames / passwords over the wire using ajax and you're worried about json lol
[03:53:52] <shoky> NodeX quick pm plz : P
[03:54:05] <NodeX> Content-Type:text/html <--- should also be application/json
[03:54:27] <sente> toxz: what is the 'problem'
[03:54:31] <sente> what are you trying to do
[03:55:09] <X-Raimo> NodeX: not really hard, but I thoung that jQuery provides something about creating JSON, that I dunno yet
[03:55:11] <NodeX> toxz : of course it's undefined
[03:55:22] <NodeX> you didn't define it !
[03:56:01] <toxz> sente - i have a script from a colleague - i only look at the 3 lines and im wondering why i get undefined on the properties of the object which are shown with the output one line before
[03:56:16] <X-Raimo> NodeX: i gonna use HTTPS
[03:56:54] <toxz> NodeX - but as you can see with console.log(x); the properties are set
[03:57:35] <X-Raimo> NodeX: I read that it has same secure level as normal HTTP POST
[03:57:53] <shoky> NodeX & Whirl3d i am disappointed! gtgbbl
[04:00:17] <X-Raimo> NodeX: is sending data by AJAX using type: "POST" less secure then using form send by method="POST"? And why?
[04:01:21] <NodeX> ;)
[04:01:30] <sacho> X-Raimo, secure for who?
[04:01:42] <sacho> what security are you expecting there?
[04:01:43] <NodeX> yo read it on the internet so it must be true]
[04:01:47] <NodeX> you*
[04:04:53] <sente> toxz: so friggin try it out
[04:04:55] <sente> show me the script
[04:05:02] <sente> dont just look at the screenshot all day and wonder
[04:05:45] <toxz> the script is too big - i cant just paste it in. to understand the whole crap its too much for someone whos not into it
[04:06:32] <toxz> sente - but thx for your effords - if i found the reaons ill tell you
[04:08:58] <sacho> toxz, maybe jquery and plugins are not using latin1 as encoding.
[04:09:30] <toxz> ?
[04:09:38] <sacho> >> test
[04:10:03] * sacho snores while waiting for jsfiddle to load all its shit.
[04:11:03] <X-Raimo> sacho: for transmittion. As far as I got: ajax send JSON'ed data same HTTP POST as usual form is set.
[04:11:16] <sacho> english, please
[04:13:16] <sviatovigt> hi
[04:13:21] <Whirl3d> shoky? disappointed! About what?
[04:13:21] <X-Raimo> sacho: for transmision. As far as I got: ajax sents JSON'ed data same HTTP POST approach as usual form with method="post" is sent.
[04:13:44] <sacho> sure
[04:13:51] <sacho> toxz, http://jsfiddle.net/rK2P6/
[04:14:20] <X-Raimo> sacho: so same way of security
[04:14:29] <sviatovigt> ie 8 is telling me that I have an error on the page when it encouters this: console.log()
[04:14:42] <sviatovigt> can anyone help me please?
[04:14:42] <sacho> because ie doesn't have a console
[04:14:51] <sacho> what's there to help with?
[04:15:24] <sviatovigt> sacho: that was the help I needed :)
[04:15:52] <sviatovigt> what can I use instead for ie (not that I'm using it, but just to know)
[04:16:04] * sacho shrugs
[04:16:15] <twoface> alert() ;) or install a tool look IE Debug Bar that has a console
[04:16:30] <sviatovigt> thanks
[04:16:35] <mindis|wurk> or maybe have a debugging element on the page where you can output whatever you like
[04:16:42] <toxz> sacho - how is that?
[04:17:02] <toxz> (http://jsfiddle.net/rK2P6/)
[04:17:28] <sacho> toxz, jquery and jqu–µry are different characters which have the same visual representation in a lot of fonts
[04:17:52] <sacho> but that's just a guess
[04:18:19] <Posterdati> hi
[04:18:22] <toxz> sacho - ah crazy - i dont think thats the reason but good to know - ill check that
[04:18:31] <sacho> toxz, you can try using charCodeAt()
[04:18:39] <sacho> ie
[04:18:54] <mindis|wurk> that was a very cunning observation, even jsfiddle shows it as the same letter
[04:19:23] <Posterdati> please I've got a problem with dialogs: I open a dialog with an svg inside it, if I try to reopen another dialog with different svg in, it shows me the old svg instead...
[04:19:46] <sacho> for (var item in x) { for (var i = 0; i < item.length; i++) { console.log(item.charCodeAt(i)); } }
[04:20:05] <Whirl3d> lol @Posterdati and svgs lol
[04:20:10] <Cork> Posterdati: sounds like your reusing an element there
[04:20:28] <Posterdati> Cork: I reassign open: for every dialog
[04:21:12] <Cork> Posterdati: thats the only explanation for why you would get the same svg if the source differ
[04:22:02] <Posterdati> http://paste.debian.net/177674/
[04:28:51] <jac0bz1> Morning! Trying to travers down an list and add like "level-1", "level-2" for each child UL in that list. I get it almost to work, but if an UL is like 2 down, i get  class="level-1 level-2". so it appends the parent class for some reason
[04:29:37] <bluepnume> Can anyone help -- I have page-A making an ajax request to page-B on the same domain (the request is in the form jQuery.post('/my/path' ...). This works fine, except when I try to embed the whole flow in an iframe on a different domain, in IE7/IE8, where I get a "No Transport" error. The request also works fine if it's a GET request rather than POST. any ideas?
[04:31:22] <Whirl3d> ? SOP
[04:31:22] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[04:43:53] <X-Raimo> sacho: NodeX: I just checked about security issue when proccessing username/password via JSON by AJAX. It has the same level of insecurity as sending form via POST. Both cases gives plain-text password. So only solution is HTTPS
[04:44:00] <bluepnume> Can anyone help -- I have a page making an ajax request to another page on the same domain (the request is in the form jQuery.post('/my/path' ...). This works fine, except when I try to the page into an iframe on a different domain, in IE7/IE8, where I get a "FORBIDDEN" error. The request even works fine if it's a GET request rather than POST. any ideas? (works fine in chrome/ff/etc)
[04:44:13] <bluepnume> *embed the page
[04:45:47] <X-Raimo> bluepnume: same behavior at all other pages or just one page&
[04:46:16] <glontu> hi
[04:46:29] <glontu> is there an easy way to wrap a form submit as an ajax call ?
[04:46:42] <bluepnume> X-Raimo -- yeah, it doesn't matter which page I make the post request to, I get the same forbidden error when it's embedded in the iframe
[04:46:48] <glontu> i don't want my browser to get redirected when i submit my form
[04:46:58] <glontu> because i have it opened in a modal dialog window
[04:47:02] <bluepnume> X-Raimo: I've checked with the backend and the request definitely isn't getting through
[04:47:42] <X-Raimo> bluepnume: You should look at IE security level and security settings
[04:48:42] <mindis|wurk> glontu you can prevent the default submit behaviour by doing something like yourbutton.click( function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[04:49:14] <simonv> Hi, I am currently creating a javascript test (multiple choice answers etc) which needs to be multi-language
[04:49:31] <glontu> mindis|wurk, i can allso return false from the form's "submit" event but how do i create a post via ajax with all the stuff that the form was going to post ?
[04:49:33] <simonv> I was wondering what the best way would be to create a multilanguage app with jqueryy
[04:50:29] <simonv> I've been thinking of creating library files per language that work somewhat like yml for instance (tag is translated in multiple languages) ... but I don't know how that would scale with JQuery (or javascript for that matter)
[04:51:01] <X-Raimo> simonv: jquery-locazile
[04:51:09] <mindis|wurk> glontu http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ or http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ . how you gather the form input info is up to you but there are methods like this http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:51:40] <X-Raimo> simonv: https://github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize/
[04:51:41] <simonv> X-Raimo: ah sweet! that's the stuff I needed yeah
[04:51:47] <simonv> (found it already :p)
[04:51:53] <jastor> WOOOOOOO... eu turned down acta ... yaaay
[04:52:13] <mindis|wurk> it'll be back, under a different name maybe but it'll be back
[04:52:19] <glontu> thanks mindis|wurk i kind of read the api ... the part about pulling the data from the form was the missing piece
[04:52:25] <GreekFreak> hi all
[04:52:27] <glontu> and doing exactly what the form was going to do
[04:52:49] <GreekFreak> How do I render a file in jquery? it seems that .load() expects a proper route, not a file in the server
[04:52:51] <X-Raimo> simonv: great thing! Also I modified it to be able to use with JSONP request. So if you need, you're welcome to ask/
[04:53:40] <EdwardIII> madness
[04:53:52] <EdwardIII> i'm trying to get jQuery validate to work on a little, simple form - but it only validates the last field heh
[04:54:15] <EdwardIII> can't seem to replicate in a fiddle, mightily irritating
[04:55:15] <X-Raimo> glontu: You can do submit button as normal button outside the form. And set onclick on this button. After that just collect form data using $(youDomElement).val()
[04:56:52] <EdwardIII> anyone seen this before? it's in ie9 i'm getting this behaviour, chrome, of course, works fine
[05:11:22] <simon> when I don't have $ available but only jQuery, what do I do to select tags?
[05:11:28] <Krambiorix> hi guys, this always alerts 'undefined' as the error : http://pastebin.com/Fbzsg9mD
[05:12:20] <fris> simon you can use jQuery(document).ready(function($) { to make $ available
[05:12:51] <simon> fris, thanks!
[05:13:09] <fris> im assuming its for wordpress or something like that?
[05:14:38] <simon> fris, no, not at all. I'm trying to test some jQuery in my browser. I was hoping I could do jQuery(document).select("...") but I seem to get the entire document that way.
[05:15:14] <Cork> simon: jQuery('selector') is the same as $('selector')
[05:15:26] <simon> Cork, oh!
[05:15:31] <Cork> alternatively you can do window.$ = jQuery
[05:15:43] <Cork> and $('selector') should work
[05:15:48] <fris> and you dont wanna call it via document or it will do the whole document
[05:15:51] <Cork> simon: $ and jQuery is the same object
[05:16:25] <simon> cool! :)
[05:16:27] <Cork> simon: theres no .select
[05:16:30] <Cork> btw :)
[05:16:49] <simon> Cork, so there used to be?
[05:16:55] <Cork> no
[05:17:15] <Cork> select should prob be for onselect events
[05:17:20] <simon> so http://api.jquery.com/select/ is an addition to the core API?
[05:17:26] <Cork> thats the only thing i can think of
[05:17:40] <simon> yeah
[05:17:41] <simon> that's it
[05:17:41] <Cork> like i said "Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element."
[05:17:46] <fris> var value = $("#numbers option:selected").val(); alert(value);
[05:18:00] <fris> something like that to get the value
[05:18:15] <Cork> a note though btw $(document).find('selector') is basically the same as $('selector')
[05:18:19] <Cork> no extra cost
[05:18:47] <simon> ok
[05:18:51] <simon> thanks!
[05:18:57] <Cork> though theres little point in adding that
[05:19:04] <Cork> (read none)
[05:20:24] <fris> simon you could use change and find like this http://stackoverflow.com/a/5857108
[05:33:33] <foryou> hi
[05:44:37] <Barthje> HOI MARK
[05:49:00] <EdwardIII> heh i'm trying to add a 'click' event but someone else has added this script:
[05:49:25] <EdwardIII> https://gist.github.com/3047165
[05:49:39] <EdwardIII> how can i listen for a click on this object when he has all that on there?
[05:51:12] <EdwardIII> i guess just get there first, heh
[05:51:16] <EdwardIII> seems less than ideal
[05:52:03] <ThrushAAX> you could unbind the other event, bind yours and put his code in your new function
[05:53:31] <ThrushAAX> you can also check if it is already bound by looking in .data("events")
[06:04:08] <Krambiorix> anyone?? this always alerts 'undefined' as the error : http://pastebin.com/Fbzsg9mD
[06:06:47] <Krambiorix> i don't understand what can be the problem?
[06:07:51] <ThrushAAX> Krambiorix: er, is it alerting the success or the error?
[06:07:59] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, the error
[06:08:26] <ThrushAAX> error doesn't have message
[06:08:43] <ThrushAAX> error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[06:10:12] <ThrushAAX> and that is why I always do console.log(msg) to see the whole thing
[06:11:22] <Deele> could anyone suggest, which jquery ui element is useful for integer number field with those increment/decrement arrows in right side?
[06:11:37] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, input[type=number]
[06:12:27] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, alert(jqXHR+"---"+textStatus+"---"+errorThrown); --->jqXHR is not defined
[06:13:13] <ThrushAAX> you changed the function paramaters too right?
[06:13:49] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, oeps, no i didn't, add all 3 ? (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[06:14:12] <ThrushAAX> if you want to use them... they need to be declared
[06:17:16] <juria_roberts> jQuery(item).parent().children().children() returns an array of elements from this set how do i get the last element which has a class name spinner?
[06:19:19] <ThrushAAX> juria_roberts: add .filter(".spinner").last() ?
[06:19:46] <juria_roberts> ThrushAAX: whats add?
[06:20:17] <ThrushAAX> actually jQuery(item).parent().children().children(".spinner:last") should work fine
[06:21:28] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, now it says "msg is null"
[06:21:36] <juria_roberts> ThrushAAX: ok ill try it
[06:21:53] <ThrushAAX> Krambiorix: pastebin your code again
[06:23:01] <tomasm-> hi, when adding objects to the end of a page, is it preferrable to use $(document).append(...), $('body').append() or something else? document doesnt seem to work, i thought it did
[06:23:31] <ThrushAAX> use body
[06:23:47] <juria_roberts> ThrushAAX: thanks it worked
[06:24:02] <tomasm-> ThrushAAX, ok, thx
[06:24:14] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, http://pastebin.com/zB5XgmPS
[06:24:51] <ThrushAAX> tomasm-: actually you could use 'html' if you wanted it outside of the body section
[06:25:41] <Viliasas> Hello, I'm making a sortable combobox with jQuery UI Autocomplete. The problem is that once combobox is shown, my page content shifts left till it hides, then my content returns to its place (content is centered with auto margins). Is there a known solution for this problem?
[06:25:52] <ThrushAAX> Krambiorix: you put the function declaration in the wrong place....
[06:26:19] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, ??
[06:28:04] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, which function declaration?
[06:28:18] <ThrushAAX> http://pastebin.com/jQvfwX8g
[06:28:34] <ThrushAAX> should be what you actually need
[06:29:40] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, "msg is null"
[06:30:09] <ThrushAAX> I don't see the words "msg is" in your code anywhere?
[06:30:32] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, okok sorry
[06:31:35] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, but my php response is null, but in my function i echo "YES"
[06:32:08] <ThrushAAX> are you returning valid JSON from the php? if not that's a problem
[06:32:25] <ThrushAAX> does your browser javascript console show any details in there?
[06:33:13] <NodeX> [14:31:35] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, but my php response is null, but in my function i echo "YES" <----------- YES is not Json!
[06:33:38] <ThrushAAX> yeah, not sure what the json parser does with that
[06:34:42] <NodeX> fails horribly
[06:35:20] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, does it have to be json , what should i change it into in  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"  ?
[06:35:31] <devoth> hi
[06:36:24] <ThrushAAX> 1) you don't need to set contentType, 2) dataType is for the stuff you get back from the server, remove that
[06:36:25] <Krambiorix> to be able to echo some string or html?
[06:38:13] <Posterdati> hi
[06:38:51] <Posterdati> how can I load an html page, say dialog_page.html, in a jquery dilog?
[06:39:27] <Cork> ?.load @ Posterdati
[06:39:29] <bot-t> Posterdati, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:39:41] <Cork> ?jQuery.load @ Posterdati
[06:39:43] <bot-t> Posterdati, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:40:24] <tocka> Does anyone know of a good jquery preloader?
[06:40:34] <tocka> Or atleast someone could direct me how to make one?
[06:40:42] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, one last question: i use POST, but in my PHP script i dump $_POST and it's an empty array
[06:41:05] <Posterdati> thanks
[06:43:09] <ThrushAAX> Krambiorix: duno, sounds pretty weird
[06:43:52] <ThrushAAX> check firebug or chrome developer tools to inspect the http request and make sure the data is actually being sent
[06:45:58] <jarco> can you do console.log on an if statement to get the true / False return?
[06:46:34] <defaultro> looks like skydiving is fun
[06:46:51] <asher^> is there a selector i can use to get the 'col' of a table element?
[06:48:53] <radiodario> hi i'm running a simple test with qunit but it doesn't stop, it keeps rerunning the same test over and over, is this expected?
[06:52:32] <nFFF> Anyone know any plugins for custom scrollbar?
[06:52:38] <nFFF> Or is it something I should just write myself?
[06:52:40] <Nece228> how to solve this?
[06:52:41] <Nece228> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'val'
[06:52:50] <Nece228> need to extract the value
[06:52:56] <radiodario> html()
[06:53:01] <radiodario> Nece228: what element?
[06:53:06] <radiodario> an input?
[06:53:10] <Nece228> yes
[06:53:33] <radiodario> how are you calling it?
[06:53:42] <radiodario> $('#inputelement').val()??
[06:54:02] <radiodario> it looks like you're not calling it on the jquery object, but on the htmlobject
[06:54:18] <Nece228> $('.validate').each(function() { alert(this.val()); });
[06:56:26] <Nece228> is there anything wrong?
[07:00:30] <radiodario> Nece228: yes you aren't selecting this
[07:00:34] <radiodario> this is a htmlelement
[07:00:34] <Zhy> Nece228: $(this).val() not this.val()
[07:00:52] <radiodario> anybody with QUnit experience?
[07:01:04] <blackspotwiggins> Zhy, Nece228 this.value works ok as well
[07:01:18] <techouse> i might require some help, cause i'm not really sure how to write this with SQL only. the thing is, i got some duplicates in the database (and i don't know them, so i kinda wanna eliminate them per-user request). if you look at the screenshot here http://shrani.si/f/1u/wN/3TSxJLTm/screen-shot-2012-07-04-a.png i wanna delete the entr with the LOWER id, if the bot entries have parsed = 0 and networks = 0; otherwise if any of them have parsed or ne
[07:01:18] <techouse> towrks > 0 then i wanna remove that one which has parsed and networks = 0
[07:01:28] <techouse> how to do that with just SQL?
[07:01:43] <radiodario> techouse: wrong channel, right nickname
[07:01:50] <Zhy> :D
[07:02:15] <techouse> damn....
[07:02:17] <Zhy> ty for the hint blackspotwiggins
[07:02:18] <techouse> sry
[07:02:34] <techouse> been having network problems all day
[07:02:40] <techouse> so irc goes on and off
[07:02:45] <techouse> sry again...
[07:03:28] <Zhy> ot
[07:03:35] <Zhy> ugh that was wrong..
[07:04:05] <Zhy> just a little keyboard tourette, move on, people
[07:06:08] <devoth> Does anyone had experience with that issue where in a jQuery UI sortable table (sorting on tr) picking up a row resulted in collapsing the rest of the rows into that space?
[07:10:29] <Nece228> ah thanks guys for figuring this out
[07:10:31] <Nece228> im so dumb sometimes
[07:11:22] <devoth> http://jsfiddle.net/v36S5/ - seems that something is messing with the placeholder but I can't figure out what
[07:12:07] <devoth> all hints are welcome :)
[07:15:46] <Hornet> yo ho
[07:16:30] <Hornet> so if I wanted to create a modal item, of any given html, is there a way to do this within jquery UI?
[07:16:52] <Hornet> using native features/api I mean
[07:18:19] <Edler> hey guys
[07:18:40] <Edler> how can i query in jquery for a selector that does not have a certain class
[07:18:41] <Edler> ?
[07:19:41] <Zhy> like what for example?
[07:20:51] <radiodario> Edler: you can query its dad
[07:20:55] <Nece228> could you please tell whats wrong with returning the variable?
[07:20:56] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/76890559
[07:21:53] <radiodario> Nece228: why are you doing it like that?
[07:21:58] <radiodario> return validate = true?
[07:22:03] <radiodario> why do you return there?
[07:22:25] <Nece228> i want to check if there are no empty inputs
[07:22:32] <Zhy> I think you just want validate = true;
[07:22:37] <radiodario> yep
[07:22:40] <Zhy> otherwise you leave the whole function and the if and alert are not reached
[07:23:21] <Nece228> but then i get the alert on every empty input
[07:23:34] <radiodario> because all inputs are empty?
[07:23:36] <sviatovigt> I want to add an element on my page but I want to make it visible through a slideDown animation
[07:23:41] <Nece228> i want only one alert
[07:23:51] <radiodario> put the input values in an array?
[07:24:08] <Nece228> hmm thats a good idea
[07:24:11] <Nece228> thanks, ill try
[07:24:23] <antihero> Is there something weird that needs to be done to get .animate({scrollLeft: x}) working?
[07:24:24] <sviatovigt> I can add it but I don't know what state should it have in order to be hidden and to appear on the page through a slideDown animation
[07:24:27] <Zhy> or put the if(validate == true ) outside the each
[07:24:30] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me?
[07:24:32] <Zhy> @Nece228
[07:25:10] <Nece228> Zhy: whoops i didnt notice that i put if in a loop
[07:25:12] <Nece228> poor me
[07:25:16] <Zhy> :D
[07:25:24] <Nece228> thanks
[07:25:39] <Zhy> np :>
[07:25:40] <asher^> wooo
[07:27:40] <antihero> I'm doing $('.mask').scrollTo(x) and it works fine!!! but if I do $('.mask').animate({scrollTo: x}) it breaks horribly
[07:27:43] <antihero> WHY?!
[07:28:01] <antihero> and by breaks horribly I mean does absolutely frack all
[07:28:04] <nmee> Hi, I'm removing an entire div containing many elements with events attached to them - should I unbind the events first, or will they disappear with their elements?
[07:28:52] <sacho> *cough* read the api
[07:29:12] <sacho> antihero, scrollTo isn't an attribute to animate
[07:29:31] <sacho> wait, how are you calling scrollTo()?
[07:29:44] <sacho> what version of jquery?
[07:30:04] <asher^> im using a jquery ui droppable, is there a way to 'refresh' it when new droppable elements are created?
[07:32:22] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm trying to use .offset() on an element but it returns 0,0 unless I call it from Chrome's console using the exact same syntax and it works. Is there something I'm not getting about this method?
[07:32:32] <silverhand> Do you have to do something special to get a custom function to work on the keyup event? This does not work: $('#foo').keyup(custom_function()); but this DOES work: $('#foo').keyup(function(){ custom_function()}); Ideas?
[07:33:18] <silverhand> DeltaHeavy: Perhaps you should look at when exactly that piece of code executes? Could it be possible it's executine before the offset has had time to be applied?
[07:34:25] <DeltaHeavy> silverhand: What do you mean before it's had time to be applied? I have a .html() that inserts the HTML containing what .offset() is grabbing values off of. Will JS execute those lines before the HTML is fully drawn? I didn't think JS was asyncronous to that extent, is it?
[07:35:25] <Zhy> silverhand try custom_function without ()
[07:35:31] <sacho> silverhand, $('#foo').keyup(custom_function()) sets the result of the execution of custom_function as the handler to keyup
[07:35:58] <silverhand> Zhy: I need to pass arguments to that function. Can I do it without brackets?
[07:36:11] <sacho> what do you mean "you need to pass arguments"?
[07:36:18] <sacho> the event is the one that is passing arguments.
[07:36:26] <silverhand> sacho: I need to pass arguments to custom_function()
[07:36:31] <sacho> when?
[07:36:40] <silverhand> When the event is triggered
[07:36:51] <sacho> that doesn't make sense
[07:37:01] <silverhand> DeltaHeavy: Not sure, it was just an idea - probably wrong.
[07:37:01] <sacho> you won't be in any execution scope you control
[07:37:17] <sacho> the keyup event will pass the event as an argument
[07:37:39] <silverhand> sacho: Perhaps I have misunderstood something here. Allow me to gist my complete code to illutrate what I am trying to achieve.
[07:37:47] <sacho> what arguments are you trying to pass
[07:38:03] <DeltaHeavy> silverhand: Surprizingly that is the issue
[07:38:30] <nFFF> Guys I have a plugin not working getting a console error
[07:38:33] <silverhand> DeltaHeavy: Really? I thought it was a long shot.
[07:38:37] <nFFF> Ive nailed it down to offset(false)
[07:38:48] <nFFF> why the fuark is it passing false to ?offset(coord)
[07:38:55] <nFFF> ?offset
[07:38:56] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:39:01] <nFFF> ?offset(int)
[07:39:06] <bot-t> nFFF, #7730 (offset.js: setOffset uses parseInt to parse css values which ... - Opened 19 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7730?cversion=0&cnum_hist=6
[07:39:07] <DeltaHeavy> silverhand: Yup, .html doesn't have an on complete it would seem =/
[07:39:10] <sacho> nFFF, consider how we could answer your question with the information you provided us
[07:39:16] <sacho> then ask an intelligent question.
[07:39:35] <nFFF> sacho, ok, if it wasn't obvious, is it possible to pass flase to offset
[07:39:38] <nFFF> and what does it achieve?
[07:41:56] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone see a problem here: http://pastie.org/4199193
[07:42:31] <sacho> it doesn't achieve anything
[07:42:51] <nFFF> I thought so
[07:43:17] <sacho> fRAiLtY-, what makes you think there's a problem
[07:43:25] <fRAiLtY-> It should say, if the selected option of the drop-down is not 24hrs do a text match on the value and return the date with either a 5 or a 10 in the nextShipDate, else on change of drop-down 5, if the selected option matches 10standard return tomorrows date otherwise return the message
[07:43:37] <fRAiLtY-> sacho:  It always returns STANDARD NEXT DAY SHIPMENT
[07:43:39] <fRAiLtY-> for some reason
[07:43:54] <sacho> it probably just wants to spite you for bad code formatting.
[07:44:05] <fRAiLtY-> Indentation?
[07:44:46] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, why not just cache the value you keep looking up? var selectVal=$(":selected").text();
[07:45:26] <fRAiLtY-> But it should work with what I've got no?
[07:45:34] <sacho> judging by the logic, apparently the text of the selected option is 24hrs
[07:46:04] <Whirl3d> To be honest, I'm not gonna waste the time to decypher all of those nested selectors when one line would clear up any onfusion
[07:46:18] <Whirl3d> *confusion
[07:47:48] <fRAiLtY-> So just swap out the option:selected's with that line Whirl3d  ?
[07:48:43] <Whirl3d> here's what I like to do for my first step in debugging: I write it all out like a sentence. If I can't ready it, it's probably not gonna work. Then, once I get it working, I can optimize it
[07:49:02] <Whirl3d> so my first run I have lots of var descriptiveName=someshit...
[07:49:14] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Thats's what I've tried to do here: if the selected option of the drop-down is not 24hrs do a text match on the value and return the date with either a 5 or a 10 in the nextShipDate, else on change of drop-down 5, if the selected option matches 10standard return tomorrows date otherwise return the message
[07:49:16] <Whirl3d> then later get rid of it once I have it all working.
[07:49:26] <fRAiLtY-> I wrote it down on a post-it note, but can't suss why it won't work lol
[07:49:48] <Whirl3d> but cache the things you keep referringto.
[07:50:05] <Whirl3d> if your are gonna compare the selected option value...put it in a variable and use that
[07:50:15] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, but surely what you're saying is make it work first then "optimise" it?
[07:50:21] <fRAiLtY-> Well it doesn't work yet :D
[07:51:04] <Whirl3d> I'll show you how I would do it and you can take it or leave it...plus it will show if your translation is the same as mine...
[07:51:09] <fRAiLtY-> Ok sure
[07:51:17] <Whirl3d> if it's clear, we should have the same thing... so gimme a second.
[07:51:26] <fRAiLtY-> Thing is I come from PHP background so my IF's are probably in the wrong "style"
[07:51:34] <fRAiLtY-> Or not suited to jQuery
[07:51:39] <fRAiLtY-> That's what I think is the prob
[07:53:44] <silverhand> sacho: Sorry, I was disconnected. Did you get a chance to look at my gist?
[07:54:05] <Whirl3d> frailty...maybe you could rely less on the text of the options and more on a value
[07:54:19] <sacho> you didn't show any gist
[07:54:19] <Whirl3d> <option value='24'>24hrs</option>
[07:54:33] <silverhand> sacho: Ah, that message must never have made it through before I was disconnected.
[07:54:34] <Whirl3d> <option value='5'>5 Working Days</option>
[07:54:41] <silverhand> sacho: Here is my gist, I believe it will illustrate what I mean https://gist.github.com/3047698
[07:54:51] <Whirl3d> then it's a lot easier to test for the value=5?
[07:55:37] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Unfortunately not, I can control the text, the values/ID's are automatically generated by Magento so they could be anything
[07:55:44] <fRAiLtY-> At least the text is controlled by me, so I know what it is
[07:55:51] <sacho> silverhand, so call them in the same way you call them the first time. What's the question?
[07:56:23] <silverhand> sacho: I was wondering if there is a way to avoid putting a single function call in a function definition.
[07:56:48] <silverhand> sacho: I am beginning to understand that there is a distion between event handler and the function being called though, and that it may be necessary.
[07:56:57] <silverhand> *distinction
[07:57:05] <sacho> silverhand, the function you are creating closes over the variables in the current context and allows you to reference them when the event is being called.
[07:57:09] <Whirl3d> the values could be anything? Do you have a sample of the html generated by Magento?
[07:57:15] <sacho> silverhand, perhaps you need to read on closures.
[07:57:25] <silverhand> sacho: I will look them up.
[07:57:42] <Whirl3d> cause watch what it would loook like if the values were 1, 5, 10 respectively....
[07:57:45] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  What I mean is they're unreliable, they're a bit random
[07:57:53] <sacho> silverhand, yes, you pass a function to keyup(). That function isn't executed immediately. It's only executed when the event is triggered.
[07:58:21] <sacho> silverhand, you'll notice that your function() also takes no arguments - it simply uses variables it has closed over from the context in which it was created
[07:59:37] <silverhand> sacho: Ok, I'll ready up on closures and let you know if there is still anything I don't understand. Thanks for your help.
[08:00:48] <wolfman2000> Morning. I've been looking for a calendar/event type program that uses jQuery lately. The one I found, dHTMLx, was tried, but I found it too complicated and cumbersome. Does anyone have any good recommendations for event/calendar software? Commercial options are allowed for this question.
[08:03:05] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  ?
[08:03:13] <fRAiLtY-> I'm watching‚Ä¶. :P
[08:03:28] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/AHyJc/
[08:03:51] <tocka> FUCK IT!
[08:03:53] <tocka> :(
[08:04:43] <ajoslin103> hello - I think I've found a couple of bugs to query.ui draggable - but can't get into bug tracker, forgot my password & it's not emailing me a reset.
[08:04:49] <Whirl3d> Since you knwo that 1=24hours and 5 is 5days and 10 is 10 days, you can check if it's 24 hours and not "standard" to change the field text to "STANDARD...." otherwise they are all the same....new Date().shipDate(numDays).displayDate();
[08:05:16] <morteza_ipo> I have timer on a page
[08:05:27] <morteza_ipo> but I have some refresh
[08:05:35] <morteza_ipo> how to save time and continue?
[08:05:43] <morteza_ipo> have any timer plugin for this?
[08:06:19] <Whirl3d> morteza_ipo, that is a mighty obtuse question. Could you post some code to jsfiddle explaining what you want to happen?
[08:06:57] <Whirl3d> ajoslin103, do you have jsfiddles to reproduce the bugs? If you don't you need them. If you do, paste them here
[08:07:38] <ajoslin103> bug #1 - if you have a draggable with a 'scope' and no droppables w/that same 'scope' then there is a .length error
[08:07:41] <morteza_ipo> Whirl3d: I have a page with test.php , that need get like test.php?id=1
[08:07:49] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  So your 6 lines replaces my entire code lol, how embarrassing :x
[08:07:58] <morteza_ipo> Whirl3d: I wanna a count down timer for that
[08:08:04] <Whirl3d> no, not embarrassing
[08:08:10] <Whirl3d> I could write it in one
[08:08:15] <Whirl3d> the thing is understanding it
[08:08:20] <ajoslin103> bug #2 -- if your draggable helper creator returns a dom element without a 'ui-draggable' class things go wonky
[08:08:23] <fRAiLtY-> I agree, I'm just amazed :o
[08:08:31] <morteza_ipo> Whirl3d: but when I refreshing the page , the timer is going to start again
[08:08:53] <morteza_ipo> means I need good timer + saving spend time
[08:09:03] <Whirl3d> Well, my code also relies on the Value of the selecteed items, so I need to see the html that Magento produces...
[08:09:36] <Whirl3d> ajoslin103, I am pretty sure that bug#2 is not a bug
[08:09:58] <Whirl3d> and do you have the fiddles that reproduce the error?
[08:10:10] <Whirl3d> cause notobody is gonna pay attention to non-reproducable errors
[08:10:34] <ajoslin103> bug #2 - agreed, I think there are complicating factors in that the draggable contains draggables
[08:10:40] <Whirl3d> cause 99.8% of the bugs people think are jquery are really just poor implementation.
[08:10:47] <ajoslin103> never tried a fiddle, guess I should do that now
[08:10:53] <Whirl3d> cool.
[08:11:18] <Whirl3d> Lots of times when I create a fiddle, just creating it makes it objvious where I miscalculated.
[08:11:42] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  It will be no use, but I'm now copying/pasting for you, the problem is each page will have different id's as they're produced on the fly then populated, but code is on way
[08:12:00] <ajoslin103> can't argue with that, I'm 99.8.99999% in love with jQ & jQui -- I never believe myself when I think it's wrong anyway
[08:12:03] <Whirl3d> not ID's but values
[08:13:43] <Whirl3d> I know me too. Every time I am sure I've found a bug, somebody shows me my mistake and I just want to crawl back into my shell and hide. LOL So now, I think: these folks know so much more than me...where is my problem...ain't found a bug yet!
[08:13:53] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  http://pastebin.com/pXpTT3nw
[08:14:09] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  As I said, the selects are created then prototype does some bs and populated them
[08:14:20] <fRAiLtY-> the id's are variable depending on which way the wind blows
[08:14:27] <fRAiLtY-> hence why I'm using .eq(5) etc in my script
[08:15:02] <Whirl3d> tha'ts not the problem.
[08:15:12] <Whirl3d> you were right to use .eq(5)
[08:15:19] <sviatovigt> I want to add an element on my page but I want to make it visible through a slideDown animation
[08:15:23] <sviatovigt> I can add it but I don't know what state should it have in order to be hidden and to appear on the page through a slideDown animation
[08:15:27] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me?
[08:15:39] <Whirl3d> I am sayig that when you have a select element, and an option that is selected, it has a value
[08:15:40] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Here's the page if it's any help, once you've selected options in the 4 drop-downs some more appear, hence .eq(5) http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[08:15:54] <Whirl3d> that value is going to be something from the product description.
[08:16:17] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  I guarantee that value will be no use
[08:16:24] <fRAiLtY-> as it varies from option-set to option-set
[08:16:27] <Whirl3d> and if it doesn't we can preprocess them to have a value based on their text
[08:16:30] <fRAiLtY-> hence why I'm relying on text
[08:16:56] <fRAiLtY-> If you choose 2 different products, I bet the resulting option-set, although appearing exactly the same, will have different values
[08:17:03] <Whirl3d> value=17 gives you "wide boy"
[08:17:05] <fRAiLtY-> even though it's only instantiated once in the backend
[08:17:10] <Whirl3d> value 16="slim jim"
[08:17:37] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm
[08:17:41] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Try the same here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/leaflet-printing
[08:17:44] <Whirl3d> value 3=5000 count
[08:17:52] <Whirl3d> value 30= 25000 count
[08:18:07] <fRAiLtY-> See if the values are the same
[08:18:25] <Whirl3d> value 24=30gsm gloss
[08:18:48] <ajoslin103> well it didn't break there, and yet still breaks in mine -- go figure! (that's my job  and I'm late -- so: thanks & gotta dash !!
[08:19:05] <Whirl3d> so, we just need a map of value-text which is in the product descript object
[08:19:28] <crazyzf> how i add a new span to a class and dont overwrite the inside content?
[08:19:42] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Tell me how to do it (the value-map) text and I'll do it
[08:19:46] <fRAiLtY-> Then I'll come back to you
[08:19:53] <fRAiLtY-> as it appears you're helping me more than I imagined :o
[08:19:59] <fRAiLtY-> As this could really slim down my code
[08:20:03] <fRAiLtY-> Perhaps I've misunderstood mage
[08:20:07] <MINTTU[MB]> Hi there, i've got a problem with dropdown menu, http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/ . When i hover "Services" the dropdown should come down, not when i hover all of them :(
[08:21:15] <Whirl3d> so write out your variable declarations  like this:   var selectedSize=$(select).eq(0).val()   var selectedCount=$(select).eq(1).val()   for example
[08:22:26] <Whirl3d> besides your html is not gonna work
[08:22:42] <Whirl3d> you can't have multiple elements with the same ID
[08:23:56] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Where are these multiple elements?
[08:24:02] <fRAiLtY-> As I say, I don't create them
[08:24:05] <fRAiLtY-> Magento does
[08:24:40] <Whirl3d> Magento is doing something wrong...or it's configured wrong...all of your cells can't  have td id='50'
[08:25:07] <fuchstronaut> is unmake the oposite of make?
[08:25:29] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  That bit actually works just fine, that's for the matrix highlighter, so I ain't going to touch it!
[08:25:34] <fRAiLtY-> That's not related to this bit though
[08:26:29] <Whirl3d> It's may appear to work, but it's gonna cause problems. I'm gonna read up on the magento script that made this for you. There is probably something wrong with it's initiliazation.... brb
[08:26:33] <MINTTU[MB]> fuchstronaut: firstly: it's "opposite"
[08:26:52] <MINTTU[MB]> and opposite words: "destroy, raze, ruin" and so forth.
[08:27:12] <fuchstronaut> well, if I "make" a user admin, how do i undo this?
[08:27:20] <fuchstronaut> theres a neat little button saying "make admin"
[08:27:29] <NoiseEee> "remove admin access"
[08:27:32] <NoiseEee> or similar
[08:27:39] <MINTTU[MB]> +1
[08:27:43] <fuchstronaut> btw is "make admin" even right?
[08:27:59] <NoiseEee> right enough, or 'give admin access'
[08:28:34] <antoineB> hello, i see in .keypress(), i can provide a map to the handler, but i access that from the handler?
[08:28:46] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  The table/matrix is my doing, with help from some guys on here
[08:30:57] <Whirl3d> then, if you created the tds with id=50 (about 2 dozen of them) than it's flat wrong. Id's should start with aan alpha chacter, followed by numbers, alpha, and a couple other symbols. Noone on here would tell you to give multiple elements the same id.
[08:31:06] <Whirl3d> it breaks jquery
[08:31:41] <fRAiLtY-> Ok well I'll address that in due course, I need to get this date thing resolved first as it's more pressing
[08:31:41] <Whirl3d> so perhaps, there was a prefix to each id
[08:32:01] <gdoron> I would like to get help on finding resources how to create a datepicker for others calendars than the "Gregorian calendar"
[08:32:28] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  http://jsfiddle.net/AHyJc/1/
[08:32:30] <fRAiLtY-> mapping
[08:32:31] <Whirl3d> other than the problem you are having could be solved by assigning your row values and column values based on your select values
[08:32:58] <Whirl3d> beautiful....
[08:33:10] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  This was already attempted, the values vary as does the table in height, meaning when we did it, it didn't work properly
[08:33:24] <morteza_ipo> how to call other object in frameset?
[08:33:43] <Whirl3d> we did it by index, not value
[08:33:47] <fRAiLtY-> Oh
[08:33:52] <fRAiLtY-> Where I must be getting confused
[08:34:10] <Whirl3d> index was the order, values are unique for magento to be able to process them
[08:34:45] <gdoron> Where is thr right place to start searching for resources?
[08:35:01] <Whirl3d> I can pretty much guarantee that your final product code will look like nn-nn-nn-nn   (which will be selectedsize-selectQty-selectedStock
[08:35:28] <fRAiLtY-> But I think the problem you'll have is the values will differ between http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/leaflet-printing and http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing even though they're the same drop-downs
[08:35:28] <Whirl3d> so those three numbers together make a hash that can only every be one product
[08:35:46] <Whirl3d> still, you will never have overlaps
[08:36:34] <Whirl3d> so they could depend on each other....the values are setup to ensure that a unique composite proruct id (sku) or what have you can be generated
[08:37:46] <Whirl3d> In fact, I can show you the entire product catalog for every combination of size, quty and stock to prove that there will be no overlaps
[08:38:03] <Whirl3d> it'd be a simple excel spreadsheet
[08:38:15] <fRAiLtY-> So, what do I do, as I need this date thing working like ASAP
[08:38:25] <fRAiLtY-> The table works, for now, albeit not correctly
[08:38:30] <fRAiLtY-> I can go back and address that later
[08:38:49] <fRAiLtY-> As far as my bosses are concerned seeing pretty things working is what they want, I can worry about getting it correct later on
[08:38:51] <fRAiLtY-> Which I will
[08:38:55] <Whirl3d> I think you have your classes and ids backwards
[08:39:03] <Whirl3d> no, sorry
[08:39:07] <fRAiLtY-> But the table isn't the problem at the moment!
[08:39:20] <Whirl3d> How much you wanna bet?
[08:39:28] <fRAiLtY-> I don't
[08:39:37] <Whirl3d> you are trying to do branching based on text values.
[08:39:39] <antoineB> is there a good way to fire event in jquery?
[08:39:57] <Whirl3d> if someone comes along and changes the capitalization of one element, your entire system is kaput
[08:39:57] <fRAiLtY-> So I've got to start again with my tablee?
[08:40:40] <Whirl3d> no, you just need to have a good grasp of what data Magento is giving you....it is using the "value" attributes from the select options to determine the products
[08:41:07] <Whirl3d> that means that using those same values in your table ensures that you are displaying the right shit.
[08:41:28] <Whirl3d> I should be able to logically say: highlight row-mySelectedQTY
[08:41:41] <Whirl3d> and column=selectedStock
[08:41:45] <Whirl3d> or something similar...
[08:41:59] <Whirl3d> because the values  (not indeces) match up
[08:42:05] <fRAiLtY-> But do they?
[08:42:18] <Whirl3d> not now.. Now they all have the same ID's
[08:42:31] <Whirl3d> so trying to select them all by id is useless
[08:42:43] <Whirl3d> instead youare selecting by class
[08:43:27] <Whirl3d> which is a fine way to select, them, just know why and select a class that follows your logic.   Gimme like 15 minutes and I'll show you what I mean
[08:43:57] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  OK
[08:44:01] <fRAiLtY-> Cos' I'm lost lol
[08:44:18] <fRAiLtY-> I knew it could be done better but I'm against a clock :x
[08:44:20] <fRAiLtY-> And learning
[08:44:26] <fRAiLtY-> so had to do what I could to make it work
[08:44:52] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Can you see my table select code?
[08:52:08] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to check if a chosen file (in an upload form) has a given extension?
[08:52:44] <NoiseEee> sure, it's just a form value like anything else
[08:52:59] <NoiseEee> (obligatory warning about extensions not guaranteeing a particular kind of file)
[08:53:08] <FernandoBasso> I am aware of that.
[08:53:26] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.
[08:54:37] <darkfrog> how do I do an Ajax POST and read back the data as flat text?
[08:55:07] <darkfrog> I keep ending up with [object Object]
[08:55:19] <darkfrog> my service I'm calling is just returning "Hello World"
[08:55:40] <darkfrog> I could also do JSON, but I don't know how to reference that either
[08:55:47] <darkfrog> the examples aren't very clear
[08:57:11] <asher^> darkfrog, check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:57:27] <asher^> ctrl+f for: }, "json");
[08:57:56] <asher^> its the dataType variable
[08:58:06] <darkfrog> asher^: that's what I've been reading through: https://gist.github.com/3048034
[08:58:19] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me with a small problem
[08:58:34] <darkfrog> I expect the alert on line 21 should show the POST response, but it shows [object Object] instead
[08:58:43] <sviatovigt> I want to add an element on a page and display it with a slideDown effect
[08:58:55] <sviatovigt> what should be the initial state of the element?
[08:59:07] <sviatovigt> I have tried height: 0px;
[08:59:11] <sviatovigt> display: none;
[08:59:15] <Whirl3d> frailty, where is your "build table" code?
[08:59:21] <sviatovigt> visibility: hidden
[08:59:27] <asher^> darkfrog have you console.log to see whats inside the object?
[08:59:49] <darkfrog> asher^: yes, I'm using Firebug and it's sending and receiving properly
[09:00:13] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  2 secs
[09:00:15] <asher^> whats in the object?
[09:01:20] <darkfrog> asher^: if I change it to this: https://gist.github.com/3048034 and respond with JSON then I get no error but also no alert...
[09:01:30] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  http://pastie.org/4199531
[09:01:45] <darkfrog> asher^: this is what the response contains now: { message: "Hello Matt!" }
[09:02:17] <asher^> so its in json
[09:02:25] <darkfrog> asher^: yes
[09:02:48] <darkfrog> asher^: when I was trying to return it as text it was just: Hello World! though
[09:02:55] <asher^> also, why are you doing the var caontent = line?
[09:02:59] <asher^> just alert(data)
[09:03:22] <darkfrog> asher^: that's just a carry-over when I thought I had to do some conversions
[09:03:38] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: also, you never/rarely want to just 'return text' straight up.  you want to receive it in a structure that you can use effectively, like the JSON you have above.
[09:04:25] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: yes, I concur, but I was simply trying to validate the stuff I was getting back at the moment. :o
[09:06:23] <darkfrog> does the service I'm calling need to respond with a specific mimetype?
[09:06:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is anyone familiar with this? http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[09:06:59] <fRAiLtY-> Did you get that Whirl3d  ?
[09:07:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to add text to a day?
[09:07:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can't click in the squares
[09:07:51] <darkfrog> crap....I set the content-type to "application/json" and now my alert doesn't show up anymore
[09:08:09] <Eidel> I having a problem with sorting divs in a alphabetic order: http://jsfiddle.net/SkQkC/20/ Can anyone see why it wont work?
[09:09:11] <abjorn> They found the Higgs-Boson....PARTY!...I guess
[09:10:30] <darkfrog> okay, can someone please tell me why the alert never shows, but in Firebug I can see that I can a 200 response with the correct JSON data? https://gist.github.com/3048034
[09:10:50] <sebastian_o|> hey guys, there is a way to access the initial request in the dom? window location is helpful but not quite enough ecause it doesn't have the parameters that comes in the first request. Any idea on how to get the initial request object?
[09:11:00] <mikkelb> Hey hey party people :)
[09:11:03] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/31/ (dropdown menu) - how do I add #main-menu > li:hover > a to the hoverIntent (so that arrow doesn't disappear before the actual dropdown)?
[09:12:38] <fRAiLtY-> Any luck Whirl3d  ?
[09:13:27] <Krambiorix> ThrushAAX, still there?
[09:13:37] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: you might have to data =  JSON.parse(data)
[09:14:19] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: no difference...and it should be giving me an error or something...
[09:14:42] <darkfrog> the function is not even getting called anymore
[09:16:24] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: where/how do you "content-type to "application/json"   ?
[09:16:35] <NoiseEee> on the backend?  before output, right?
[09:16:53] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: anyways, firebug/console should show you whats received, so what is it?
[09:18:00] <riku-> Is it possible to return all the selected filenames / paths of a multiple file input?
[09:18:52] <riku-> .val() seems to return just the first file's path
[09:20:38] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: "{ message: "Hello Matt!" }"
[09:20:52] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: Yes, I'm setting it on the back-end
[09:20:55] <crankharder> what's the limit on param size for an .ajax request?  currently i'm sending 10K characters direct to my development rails server and it works fine...  what's going to happen in prod w/ apache, etc... ?
[09:21:32] <sebastian_o|> so, there is NO WAY to access in the DOM the first request sent by the browser?
[09:21:48] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/32/ - how do I include that dropdown arrow inside the JS hovering?
[09:24:49] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: and what does console.log(data) give you?
[09:24:58] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: is your pastebin the same?
[09:25:08] <mikkelb> NoiseEee: any chance u could give me a hand bruv?
[09:26:06] <NoiseEee> mikkelb: #css
[09:27:00] <mikkelb> NoiseEee: But the CSS is done, now I just need the JS to treat #main-menu .dropdown:hover > a which deals with the arrow, in the same way it treats the main dropdown: #main-menu .dropdown ul
[09:28:32] <mikkelb> NoiseEee: so how about that hand
[09:29:54] <NoiseEee> but it cant
[09:29:56] <NoiseEee> afaik
[09:30:00] <NoiseEee> ul is a real element
[09:30:11] <NoiseEee> ...in the doc, ready for JS to act upon
[09:30:46] <NoiseEee> now, if your arrow was also in the doc proper but hidden/shown, you could do something.  afaik anyways; not a css guy.
[09:31:57] <mikkelb> NoiseEee: cool thanks man
[09:32:30] <mikkelb> NoiseEee: what do you mean by doc proper though?
[09:33:39] <NoiseEee> an actual element in the document.
[09:34:04] <mikkelb> oh i see..

[09:59:26] <javalover> look facebook does it, when you click on a photo if you push teh back button it closes the photo
[10:07:53] <Pumukel> Hello, I have a question on jQuery Tools tabs and registering an onClick handler, that should be processed after a tab change has processed, did someone know how to do this?
[10:08:26] <javalover> look facebook does it, when you click on a photo if you push teh back button it closes the photo

[10:29:46] <Posterdati> hi
[10:30:54] <Posterdati> I'm trying to load a galleriffic test page as dialog content, but when I click on a thumbnail it opens a new page instead of show it in the gallery

[10:35:09] <LiENUS> MINTTU[MB], was that directed at me?
[10:35:27] <MINTTU[MB]> LiENUS, yes mate
[10:35:33] <MINTTU[MB]> google for keycode
[10:35:34] <MINTTU[MB]> something
[10:36:02] <LiENUS> i wasnt sure if since f10 is a browser hotkey it would be blocked from js
[10:36:35] <rmill> ya, don't use F10

[10:37:19] <jammsen> i just wrote a function and imported jquery
[10:37:32] <LiENUS> rmill, this'll be fun then to retrain them to use a new hotkey :/
[10:39:47] <rmill> LiENUS: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Wzd5f/

[10:58:17] <`poo> datarecal: cause you have width: 100% on the image ..
[10:59:14] <datarecal> `poo where is it set to 100%
[10:59:28] <datarecal> ahh
[10:59:30] <datarecal> stupid me
[10:59:46] <datarecal> sorry
[11:04:29] <Posterdati> please help. I need help with jquery dialog + galleriffic, load a galleriffic page into a dialog won't work... If i load the same page with the browser it works. Please help
[11:06:01] <LoneStar99> can someone take a look at the following textbox and tell me how i can go about doing with jquery --> http://news.yahoo.com/scientists-unveil-milestone-higgs-boson-hunt-044513533.html
[11:06:50] <LoneStar99> text is in box, but on input box focus it hides, but the text inputed will not hide or reset....
[11:16:30] <arkascha> I could need some advice: trying to create a popup (in differnt styles, same problem), where there is an input field holding some text meant to be copied to the clipboard when presented.
[11:16:43] <arkascha> I dont want to use that flash copy-to-clipboard-thing, I prefer the more simple solution.
[11:16:55] <arkascha> So I fancy this dialog, an input field in there and text in there which is selected().
[11:17:05] <arkascha> However, I do not succeed. All version of calling select() and focus() in that input field or its dialog fail to produce the effect I want.
[11:17:19] <arkascha> ? Has anyone done such thing ? _how_ is that done ?
[11:17:21] <bot-t> arkascha, Couldn't find "Has anyone done such thing ? _how_ is that done ?" in jQuery Docs.
[11:17:43] * arkascha didn't ask for that.
[11:18:13] <`poo> arkascha: you want to copy to clipboard without flash?
[11:18:41] <arkascha> `poo: with the users help, yes.
[11:18:55] <`poo> what do you mean?
[11:19:06] <arkascha> or is there any other solution without flash ?
[11:19:28] <`poo> you just want to select the text?
[11:19:36] <arkascha> yes
[11:19:41] <`poo> you can't copy to clipboard without flash
[11:19:47] <arkascha> I know.
[11:19:48] <`poo> afaik
[11:20:12] <arkascha> That why I want to select() the content, so that the user just has to press Ctrl-C.
[11:20:56] <`poo> what's select() ?
[11:21:02] <Posterdati> is there a way to make galleriffic works in jquery dialog
[11:21:04] <Posterdati> ?
[11:21:33] <arkascha> `poo: jquerys select().
[11:22:21] <`poo> jquery's select is just a wrapper for the select event, and i dont see how that'd help you
[11:22:45] <`poo> i'd go for this solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985272/jquery-selecting-text-in-an-element-akin-to-highlighting-with-your-mouse
[11:24:19] <`poo> actually donno if that's good for  a textbox
[11:24:46] <`poo> sry my bad
[11:24:56] <arkascha> `poo: you might want to re-read the documentation for jquerys select().
[11:25:18] <arkascha> it also serves to select content, as typical for jquery methods: give and take.
[11:25:33] <`poo> arkascha: no, it serves to trigger the 'select' event
[11:25:47] <`poo> or action
[11:26:23] <`poo> which is what you want, no? :)
[11:26:55] <`poo> http://jsfiddle.net/JXzbj/
[11:27:26] <`poo> or: http://jsfiddle.net/JXzbj/1/
[11:28:55] <arkascha> `poo: sure, comes out the same.
[11:29:08] <arkascha> Took a look at you rfiddlers, same problem as mine.
[11:29:15] <arkascha> It does wor - somehow, BUT
[11:29:19] <arkascha> try pressing "run".
[11:29:19] <`poo> hm?
[11:29:31] <`poo> yes?
[11:29:35] <`poo> it selects and focuses
[11:30:05] <arkascha> I tried taht too: http://jsfiddle.net/4CK7Y/2/
[11:30:16] <arkascha> But it is only a half solution.
[11:30:21] <arkascha> It only works when reloadedf.
[11:30:32] <arkascha> It does NOT work when you click "Run" in the fiddler.
[11:31:32] <`poo> does for me
[11:31:38] <arkascha> hm
[11:31:47] <arkascha> what I suspected but did not want to belive.
[11:31:55] <arkascha> What browser on your side ?
[11:32:36] <`poo> chrome
[11:32:57] <arkascha> yeah, that seems to work. Does not work in firefox.
[11:35:41] <NoiseEee> arkascha: works for me fine in firefox.
[11:36:05] <`poo> for me too
[11:36:13] <`poo> tho i have  a really old ff here
[11:38:21] <arkascha> `poo: hm, does not work for me. Nor does it work in opera or koqueror.
[11:38:56] <arkascha> `poo: interesting: it DOES work in an wold FF I have around here too.
[11:39:41] <NoiseEee> arkascha: not sure what exactly your issue is, it most definitely does work in Firefox and Opera
[11:39:42] <NoiseEee> but good luck!
[11:40:57] <arkascha> NoiseEee: what version of FF ? What OS ?
[11:41:31] <NoiseEee> FF 13.0.1
[11:41:44] <NoiseEee> Opera 12
[11:41:51] <NoiseEee> ubuntu
[11:42:55] <`poo> installed ff 13 now, doesn't work when clicking run
[11:42:55] <arkascha> NoiseEee: you sure you got the itch ?
[11:43:07] <arkascha> It DOES work when you realod or first load.
[11:43:20] <arkascha> It does NOT work in FF when you ht "Run" in the fiddler.
[11:43:46] <arkascha> `poo: yep.
[11:44:18] <arkascha> but I have the same effect in opera and konqueror too, tough in a little more complex setup.
[11:44:30] <`poo> but does that matter?
[11:44:32] <arkascha> I suspect there is some corner effect playing in.
[11:44:39] <`poo> so the fiddle Run button isn't doing it
[11:44:45] <arkascha> `poo: does what matter ?
[11:44:51] <arkascha> ah
[11:44:58] <navaismo> Hi, I cant get the value from one variable, im using this code http://pastebin.com/3qtNfTZF, basically I create a select tag from mysql query, but i cant get the value of this select when press the button with id "lookcdr"
[11:45:16] <arkascha> yes it does, I suspect this is the same reason why it does not work from within an application, which it does not.
[11:45:38] <`poo> it still works on an event handler: http://jsfiddle.net/JXzbj/2/
[11:45:40] <arkascha> I just used the fiddler to create a simple test case.
[11:46:31] <arkascha> `poo: yep, does work for me. However I fail to ge tthis working when firing my dialog.
[11:47:05] <NoiseEee> "firing my dialog" means what
[11:47:40] <arkascha> currently using the impromptu jquery extension.
[11:47:48] <arkascha> I load an html form into it.
[11:47:55] <arkascha> That contains an input field with text.
[11:48:07] <arkascha> I call select() in that but the text is NOT selected.
[11:48:32] <arkascha> Also tried the dialog extension, same problem.
[11:48:44] <arkascha> I suspect something is _stealing_ the focus.
[11:51:00] <NoiseEee> arkascha: so maybe step through everything happening
[11:51:13] <`poo> if you press ctrl-enter in fiddle to trigger the Run action, it works fine ;P
[11:52:12] <NoiseEee> as does deliberately setting the focus.  http://jsfiddle.net/4CK7Y/22/
[11:53:15] <arkascha> `poo: Ctrl-Enter does _not_ work on my fiddler.
[11:53:26] <`poo> (and if you want it to stay selected if you click a few times, http://jsfiddle.net/4CK7Y/24/ )
[11:53:43] <NoiseEee> meh i was trying chrome
[11:54:38] <arkascha> NoiseEee: tried numerous combinations of focus() and select(). No success.
[11:54:49] <NoiseEee> arkascha: so maybe step through everything happening
[11:55:02] <arkascha> tried that, could not place my finger anywhere.
[11:55:16] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/32/ - how do I make that dropdown arrow show/hide at the same time as the main dropdown? Is there a better way than http://jsfiddle.net/tDnHE/34/ ?
[11:55:48] <arkascha> Looks like the focus is broken when using firebug.
[11:55:52] <`poo> mikkelb: i didnt understand what you didn't like about my solution?
[11:57:11] <mikkelb> `poo: Well, the arrow is part of the styling so I'd prefer not to mix it in with the markup.
[11:57:26] <mikkelb> I.e. the <div class="arrow"></div>
[11:57:44] <mikkelb> The <div class="d"> is totally okay though.
[11:57:50] <`poo> why not? it's an element taking up space
[11:58:37] <`poo> guess i could do it with pure css too but that'd be a pain
[11:59:06] <NoiseEee> mikkelb: again, you can't make JS work on elements that aren't really in the document.
[12:00:01] <mikkelb> hmm i see i see
[12:00:12] <mikkelb> i do feel what y'all are saying..
[12:02:32] <mikkelb> damn
[12:02:47] <mikkelb> i dunno guys..
[12:03:15] <javalover> is whirl3d here?
[12:03:16] <Max-P> Hi, quick advice request: I need to do some really complex drag and drop (moving a couple of elements at the same time, moving an item that will in fact make a copy, some fun stuff), is it possible with jQuery UI (sortable, draggable?) or am I better writing my own?
[12:03:40] <javalover> guys I want to change my browsers url but I don't want to change the page, so that when the user clicks on the back button it simply closes the window opened on the page
[12:03:54] <javalover> also so that someone can link to the new page created
[12:04:24] <javalover> now one guy says you can do it with hashtags so like www.mysite.com/thepage.html#1
[12:04:38] <`poo> javalover check out http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[12:04:42] <javalover> and that works but I want to do it without hashtags, as facebook does it without hashtags
[12:04:45] <javalover> yeah i saw that poo
[12:04:58] <javalover> i'm wondering facebook does this without hashtags is there anyway I can do it without the hashtags?
[12:05:07] <mikkelb> `poo: going with your solution man its actually not that bad
[12:05:08] <mikkelb> thanks again
[12:05:21] <`poo> np
[12:05:23] <oberststen> Hello! I'm using a form to upload a file, when there is a submit button it works ok, however if I user $(form).submit() it sends everything but the file, any solution?
[12:06:10] <javalover> well actually the maine reason I ask is because i use myobj.onmouseup(function(){}
[12:06:17] <javalover> and i don't know how to add hashtags to the existing url
[12:06:21] <javalover> without using ahref
[12:07:43] <Max-P> javalover, It's the "pushState" function of the browser. However, it's pretty new so some older browsers don't support it
[12:08:01] <Max-P> Facebook fallback on hashtags when not available
[12:08:10] <Max-P> and it's window.location.hash to get/set the hash ;)
[12:08:32] <Max-P> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history/
[12:08:36] <NodeX> history.js - takes care of it all
[12:08:47] <NodeX> cross browser / backwards compat
[12:09:43] <javalover> max you're awesome!
[12:10:04] <javalover> so fbook does use hashtags in the long run lulz that's awesome
[12:14:39] <Max-P> Well, no answers, I guess I will make a new custom sortable() then. At lest I will have as much control as I need. Lots of fun ahead =/
[12:27:50] <mikkelb> `poo: couple of followups if you dont mind though
[12:27:52] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/35/ - 1. Why do those small arrows jump when you hover them? 2. Why won't the z-index on those big arrows work so that they're pushed in front?
[12:30:41] <jedimind> why in gods name do those exist as their won elements/
[12:30:52] <jedimind> that whole thing doesnt need to be anything more than a nested UL mikkelb
[12:30:53] <jedimind> the arrows should just be background images on anchors
[12:31:05] <jedimind> instead of some stupidly convoluted absolute positioning of an empty <div class="arrow"></div>
[12:31:31] <jedimind> also dont need ANY javascript for this
[12:31:44] <jedimind> just a :hover state on the LI will suffice
[12:32:12] <mikkelb> jedimind: Well I wanted to use hoverIntent to make the dropdowns a bit more accessible, say if the user accidentally moves his or her cursor outside the hover area
[12:32:25] <mikkelb> The dudes in #jquery said this was the only way if I wanted to include that arrow thingie
[12:32:32] <Rudeboy> I'm trying to get my pages to fade in on loading using the following Jquery: http://pastebin.com/FXXz9TTm, but it's not working. It works if I change load to hover, but I don't want hover, I want it to fade when it loads "_
[12:32:36] <jedimind> but instead you've made it less accessible for people who dont have js enabled
[12:32:48] <jedimind> you should add the JS ontop as an added experience behaviour, not a dependency
[12:32:57] <jedimind> here, hold on 2 mins
[12:33:00] <mikkelb> jedimind: I used to do it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/33/ thanks to reisio, but as you can see that arrow did not show/hide in tandem with the rest
[12:33:10] <mikkelb> cool
[12:33:43] <jedimind> you mean that triangle at the top of the dropdown ?
[12:33:50] <mikkelb> yup
[12:33:59] <jedimind> that can just be a :before pseudo-element
[12:33:59] <mikkelb> yes sir
[12:33:59] <Rudeboy> Has anyone gotten a page in effect to work with Jquery? I'm using Drupal 7
[12:34:13] <jedimind> ul > li > ul:before { }
[12:34:15] <mikkelb> no shit..
[12:34:54] <jedimind> mikkelb, i'll fiddle you an example of it
[12:34:54] <jedimind> hold
[12:35:03] <mikkelb> thank you so much man..
[12:35:15] <jedimind> *giggle* "I'll fiddle you..."
[12:35:18] <`poo> mikkelb just to answer your question about the arrows jumping: http://jsfiddle.net/tDnHE/37/
[12:35:30] <mikkelb> on shit "the dudes in #jquery"
[12:35:35] <mikkelb> this *is* #jquery
[12:35:39] <Rudeboy> If someone has a chance, could they please check my small snippet of code at http://pastebin.com/FXXz9TTm and tell me what my error is? I'll really appreciate it
[12:35:45] <`poo> you put them on the 'right' , but they were centered vertically
[12:35:53] <mikkelb> `poo: much obliged !
[12:37:43] <jack_guru> I am trying to do perform some action on a login form. What I have so far works just when you click on the password field, and I want it to take place even when the user clicks the username field: if ($("input:password").is(":focus")) { //do something}
[12:37:43] <`poo> and yea, :before sounds like a good solution. i should learn to use more of those
[12:39:16] <`poo> jack_guru: $('#usernameField').click(function() { //do something })  ?
[12:39:39] <lonecub2131> Hi, I am trying to use jquery1.7.2 in noconflict mode on a Drupal site which, ships with an older version of jquery. Long story short, I have added two additional script tags in the template file. The first tag calls in the latest jquery code and right after this, the second tag calls; var $js = jQuery.noConflict(true); but, both $jq and jQuery returns "function()" in firebug instead, of the...
[12:39:41] <lonecub2131> ...jQuery object.
[12:39:44] <jack_guru> `poo, thanks! Trying it out now
[12:40:30] <`poo> lonecub2131: they don't work?
[12:41:21] <`poo> lonecub2131: console.log( $js.fn.jquery )
[12:41:51] <lonecub2131> `poo: If I try to output the drupal's jQuery object then, I do see the jquery 1.5 object but, the other just return an empty function
[12:42:06] <`poo> that doesn't answer my question
[12:42:35] <Rudeboy> Can someone please help quick? On a time limit, and it's probably such a quick fix:/
[12:42:52] <lonecub2131> `poo: huh! $js.fn.jquery does return saying, "1.7.1"
[12:42:59] <`poo> yays
[12:43:21] <lonecub2131> but, why does it return "function()" when I try console.log($jq)?
[12:43:48] <`poo> Rudeboy: what are you doing with .load ?
[12:43:52] <jedimind> mikkelb, http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/9JsBe/
[12:44:06] <Rudeboy> `poo: I just want the page to fade in when the page loads
[12:44:18] <jedimind> mikkelb, no js, no extra elements just super clean ul/li structure
[12:45:06] <jedimind> mikkelb, now, if you're worried about the accessibility of it, you can add a js layer ontop of it to add a delay on the hide/show state of the dropdown
[12:45:16] <`poo> Rudeboy: call $(window).load then
[12:45:22] <`poo> Rudeboy: and why are you giving 2 parameters to .load ?
[12:45:48] <Rudeboy> `poo: Tonight is my first night using Jquery, I'm still very unfamiliar with it
[12:45:49] <mikkelb> jedimind: praise the lord !!
[12:46:03] * jedimind != lord
[12:46:08] <mikkelb> hehe
[12:46:11] <`poo> Rudeboy: well, look at the docs before you use some method
[12:46:23] * mikkelb runs up to jedimind and shakes jedimind's hands repeatedly
[12:46:47] <Rudeboy> `poo: I thought if I have the hover snippet working, then I could just change the "hover" command to "load" command?
[12:48:11] <`poo> Rudeboy: why would you think that?
[12:48:20] <mikkelb> jedimind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBxFkzg8G64 :D
[12:48:22] <mikkelb> thank you so much man
[12:48:29] <Rudeboy> `poo: Cause it seems logical ha ha:)
[12:48:34] <jedimind> no problem
[12:48:34] <`poo> nice, jedimind
[12:48:35] <Rudeboy> `poo: Am I completely worng?
[12:48:45] <jedimind> feel free to ask questions about it, if you need to understand why / how
[12:48:52] <`poo> Rudeboy: it seems logical that if X is used one way then Y must be used the same way ?
[12:48:54] <jedimind> because thats what makes it worth while, if you learn and not just cut'n'paste
[12:49:09] <mikkelb> jedimind: well, for the js layer.. should i use hoverintent like i used to?
[12:49:23] <`poo> Rudeboy: hover means mouseover and mouseout, two seperate events, hence you give it 2 callbacks
[12:49:29] <`poo> Rudeboy: that wouldn't make sense with load
[12:49:46] <Whirl3d> did you request help from gallerific?
[12:50:01] <Rudeboy> `poo: oh... so then I must use the $(window) for that then?
[12:50:01] <mikkelb> oh im definitely learning from this
[12:50:17] <mikkelb> this is what good design is all about imho
[12:50:25] <jedimind> i would do something like $('nav > ul > li').mousein(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).find('ul').fadeIn(); }).mouseout(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).find('ul').stop(true,true).delay('200').fadeOut(); });
[12:50:27] <jedimind> roughly
[12:50:43] <mikkelb> heh
[12:50:53] <mikkelb> just like that no large libraries or anything?
[12:50:54] <jedimind> i mean fade in/out is optional
[12:51:02] <jedimind> well assuming you have jquery already in there
[12:51:07] <mikkelb> yup i do
[12:51:21] <jedimind> yeah, that's all you'll need then
[12:51:26] <Whirl3d> ?mousein
[12:51:27] <jedimind> here, i'll adjust my fiddle
[12:51:27] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .mouseenter() - Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[12:51:32] <jedimind> mouseenter not mousein
[12:51:36] <jedimind> sorry was just doing it off the top of my head
[12:51:39] <Whirl3d> ?mouseleave
[12:51:40] <bot-t> .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[12:51:48] <jedimind> ^ that :)
[12:52:19] <Whirl3d> the best way to do that would be css3 with the hover pseudo selector and transitions
[12:52:33] <Whirl3d> if you have a modern browser
[12:52:45] <Whirl3d> and then jquery fallback if you have to support older browsers
[12:53:18] <lonecub2131> `poo: however, $jq still returns "function()" and it breaks all the javascript code when I try to pass $jq e.g. (function($) {...})($jq); instead of (function($) {...})(jQuery);\
[12:53:19] <mikkelb> wait hold up you're saying css3 alone can do what hoverintent does?
[12:53:30] <jedimind> Whirl3d, the focus is not on the transitions
[12:53:35] <jedimind> but more so the delay on mouseleave
[12:53:46] <Whirl3d> You can apply delays to css3 transitions
[12:53:47] <Rudeboy> `poo: I've got this so far: http://pastebin.com/G6GqU3eW
[12:53:49] <jedimind> incase someone accidentally moves mouse outside of the hit area, dont want to hide it right away
[12:53:51] <jedimind> thats true
[12:53:53] <jedimind> actually
[12:54:01] <jedimind> good call
[12:54:12] <`poo> Rudeboy:  thats more like it
[12:54:15] <`poo> Rudeboy: http://jsfiddle.net/GzghF/
[12:54:16] <jedimind> though id still lean on javascript just for the cross browser support
[12:54:29] <Whirl3d> and a delay on both sides (enter and exit) would ensure that you intended to enact the hover state
[12:54:59] <Whirl3d> I like to use the transit.js plugin to handle all the animation in css when it can...no work on my part
[12:55:16] <jack_guru> `poo, I tried #usernameField like this: if ($('#usernameField').is(":focus")) { .... but with no luck. It is my first day playing with jquery so sorry if this is stupid
[12:55:24] <Whirl3d> I code it for jquery, simply include the transit.js library and it subs out when it can
[12:55:28] <jedimind> Whirl3d, is that a polyfil for css3 animations?
[12:55:35] <Whirl3d> yup
[12:55:39] <mikkelb> marvellous marvellous
[12:55:42] <`poo> jack_guru: that's not what i told you to do though. you said you wanted something to happen when the field is clicked. thats the code i gave you
[12:55:49] <jedimind> mikkelb, yeah, basically you have a few options
[12:55:57] <Whirl3d> it's nice and handles it without have to invoke it or anything...
[12:56:00] <mikkelb> i sure do
[12:56:01] <jedimind> e.preventDefault() wont actually prevent the hover event
[12:56:13] <jedimind> Whirl3d, im always weary of adding one more polyfil
[12:56:19] <jedimind> with modernizr and selectivizr
[12:56:28] <mikkelb> im always in favor of less dependencies though
[12:56:34] <mikkelb> and less fancy animations and that sorta thing
[12:56:39] <jedimind> and jquery, it seems like there's an ever growing number of bloat ontop
[12:56:44] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I don't use them really. I probably should, but meh
[12:56:47] <mikkelb> i want to create something supersimple and superneat that will stand the test of time
[12:56:54] <Rudeboy> `poo: WOOHOOOO!!!!!! It's working Now!!:D Thanks so much!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:57:11] <Whirl3d> mikkelb, nice dream.
[12:57:13] <jack_guru> `poo, yeah I tried that as well, but not really sure how to use it in my code. let me give it another try
[12:57:16] <jedimind> mikkelb,  a good mentality to have is to create it with the lowest common denominator in mind
[12:57:19] <jedimind> and then build ontop of it
[12:57:20] <Whirl3d> there's no such thing. Think about it. LOL
[12:57:30] <Whirl3d> 8)
[12:57:31] <mikkelb> oh fo sure
[12:57:42] <Whirl3d> do we use anything we used a year ago? hmmmm....
[12:57:53] <Whirl3d> but it's still a great goal to have in  mind.
[12:58:03] <Whirl3d> I'm just givin you a hard time..
[12:59:13] <`poo> Rudeboy: ;]
[12:59:55] <`poo> lonecub2131: what code does it break? what happens?
[13:00:23] <`poo> lonecub2131: nevermind what you see in firebug console when you just type '$jq'
[13:00:31] <`poo> lonecub2131: if $jq.fn.jquery was fine...
[13:00:59] <lonecub2131> `poo: It returns "function()"
[13:01:03] <jedimind> Whirl3d, i would disagree with that a little bit
[13:01:09] <jedimind> there are certain ways i code things that i havent changed in 4-5 years
[13:01:12] <jedimind> that are still applicable today
[13:01:18] <Rudeboy> `poo: Is it possible to use digits for duration?
[13:01:28] <jedimind> Whirl3d, but by and large, you're right, its an adaptive environment
[13:01:35] <sunbeam> zooming in, on a page with small font content (a lot paragraph content), is this possible some way with jquery? I mean zooming in as getting a zoom icon that you can click on the text.
[13:01:41] <lonecub2131> `poo: I have used multiple versions of jquery on other Drupal sites but, I have never come across this issue before
[13:02:17] <`poo> lonecub2131: i said NEVERMIND what it says when you log it :)
[13:02:24] <`poo> as in, DONT MIND it
[13:02:28] <Whirl3d> I see what you are saying. And besides if you work with the idea in mind of creating something timeless, it's a far sight better than just doing enought to get by
[13:03:32] <fedya> Any idea what could be causing this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'submit' of undefined it's thrown by validator's submitHandler: function(form) { document.formframe.submit(); // work around for Safari }
[13:03:43] <lonecub2131> `poo: Oh ic. Sorry. Well, there is absolutely no error or warning in the console.
[13:03:44] <fedya> i used form.submit() but that doesn't work in safari
[13:04:10] <NoiseEee> fedya: clearly document.formframe is undefined / not a valid reference
[13:04:41] <lonecub2131> And none of the jquery code runs inside that closure
[13:04:54] <`poo> lonecub2131: you said $jq.fn.jquery runs
[13:05:32] <`poo> lonecub2131: http://jsfiddle.net/fECAX/1/
[13:05:46] <lonecub2131> `poo: Yes, it does. And that's what's bothering me. How can it report back the correct version but, does not return the actual jquery object
[13:05:57] <fedya> NoiseEee: but it submits oddly enough
[13:06:09] <fedya> throws that exception it flashes and the form submits
[13:06:11] <`poo> lonecub2131: it's a function
[13:06:20] <`poo> lonecub2131: who cares what the console says when you log it
[13:06:32] <`poo> lonecub2131: the .noConflict caused it to appear that way
[13:07:33] <NoiseEee> fedya: probably do to some other reason, ie: you're pressing a submit button or enter
[13:08:05] <fedya> should i just let it go since it works?
[13:08:31] <lonecub2131> `poo: Ok, I am going to try something. But, thanks for the help
[13:08:44] <`poo> lonecub2131: in firebug it shows me "function ()" even if all i do is load jquery 1.7.2 as normally as possible and just console.log(jQuery)
[13:08:49] <fedya> possibly validator is disabling the submit event on the button, but the exception is coming from that line within the submitHandler
[13:08:53] <`poo> so that's obviously not a problem
[13:08:56] <jack_guru> `poo, doesn't #usernameField require some id on the <input> tag? Because I want to make it abstract so that it runs on all websites through a firefox addon
[13:09:12] <`poo> jack_guru: yes it required the id 'usernameField
[13:09:20] <`poo> requires*
[13:09:32] <lonecub2131> `poo: I am not sure. But, I am going to do some more tests to narrow down on it
[13:10:03] <lonecub2131> Thanks for the help though :-)
[13:10:42] <`poo> np
[13:10:58] <`poo> byez
[13:11:03] <jack_guru> `poo, that's bad. What I was thinking is having jquery look inside the <form> tag and if one of the <input>'s is of type password then when clicking any of the fields woulds take some action. But not sure if possible
[13:11:46] <`poo> jack_guru: that's all possible, but only if you fill what you actually want to happen..
[13:12:12] <`poo> gtg tho.
[13:12:23] <jack_guru> `poo, I just want a notification to show up. I've got this part working
[13:16:29] <fedya> wow, i renamed the submit button to send as per http://www.luqmanmarzuki.com/read/20101222/jquery_form_validation_not_submitting_in_safari.html and it worked
[13:18:23] <fedya> when using jquery validation plugin submit won't work with safari, but if you name="<something other than submit>" it will submit with form.submit(), how do I submit a bug report / feature request to the author of that plugin?
[13:19:43] <NoiseEee> fedya: thats not a bug, thats the way javascript works
[13:19:54] <NoiseEee> fedya: don't name your buttons "submit" :)
[13:20:05] <fedya> hm this is news to me
[13:28:07] <hiredman> if I make an ajax request and my success handler gets called, what is the data parameter?
[13:28:18] <xboi209> can anyone help me: http://jsfiddle.net/DS8SL/1/
[13:28:22] <sunbeam> zooming in, on a page with small font content (a lot paragraph content), is this possible some way with jquery? I mean zooming in as getting a zoom icon that you can click on the text.
[13:30:08] <NoiseEee> hiredman: the response from the server
[13:30:27] <Mavericks_> hello
[13:31:27] <Mavericks_> i am collecting data entered in the form( basic username/password) and then sending it to localhost/login
[13:31:53] <Mavericks_> where login takes username as request.form['username'] etc
[13:31:54] <Mavericks_> http://jsfiddle.net/3S2HL/1/
[13:32:13] <hiredman> NoiseEee: ok, but as what? an array of [status code, body]? just the body? is the body a string (seems not to be the case, if I call alert on data I get something like [object] [Object])
[13:32:50] <NoiseEee> hiredman: console.log(data) and take a look!
[13:33:12] <xboi209> http://jsfiddle.net/DS8SL/3/      anyone?
[13:35:41] <NoiseEee> xboi209: http://jsfiddle.net/DS8SL/6/
[13:36:11] <Kzim> hello i use Rangy and i need to give him something like document.body. is there a way to have something like $(".myclass") witht document format (i don't really understand the link between document and jquery system)
[13:36:22] <xboi209> NoiseEee: ty
[13:36:23] <NoiseEee> xboi209: sorry i rewrote a bit of it while i was there.  your problem was a ";" .... look at your console, it always has the errors...
[13:36:35] <shoky> wat
[13:36:35] <shoky> var get - rawr - id = $('img').attr('id');
[13:37:01] <xboi209> o
[13:37:26] <shoky> you see the problem with that line, ye?
[13:38:06] <shoky> oh NoiseEee fixed up your first fiddle
[13:38:17] <xboi209> mhmm
[13:39:52] <jedimind> NoiseEee, you so niiiice
[13:40:35] <NoiseEee> its america day!
[13:40:39] <shoky> Kzim:  a jquery object is a pseudo-array of DOM elements. so if you want to get e.g. the first selected element, you can:  var domElement = $(".myclass")[0];
[13:40:40] <b_52globe> hi guys
[13:40:48] <b_52globe> could anybody hep me plz with this http://jsfiddle.net/3yQZ6/
[13:41:09] <b_52globe> on the xaxis i need to display the data in the correct format
[13:41:14] <nFFF>  is there anyway in a div overflow:scroll, to get how much the user has scrolled?
[13:43:56] <shoky> nFFF $('div').scrollTop()  not good enuff?
[13:44:14] <shoky> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/UjMPM/
[13:44:46] <nFFF> shoky, should have been more clear
[13:44:59] <nFFF> I need to get the scrolltop positon as user scrolls with mouse :D
[13:45:14] <shoky> still not clear enough :P
[13:45:54] <nFFF> Im trying to create a custom scroll bar
[13:46:11] <nFFF> when the user clicks on the text area and scrolls using therre mouse or by grabbing the bar
[13:46:20] <nFFF> I need to get an updated mouse position
[13:46:59] <shoky> what text area. what do you mean 'updated mouse position' ?
[13:47:14] <shoky> a fiddle would be clearest :P
[13:47:24] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/hBgjM/
[13:47:47] <nFFF> as they grab the grey bar on he right and move it down
[13:47:51] <nFFF> the text should move
[13:47:58] <nFFF> and likewise when they use there mosue wheel
[13:48:00] <nFFF> it should move
[13:48:09] <ryanneufeld> nFFF, you do know about overflow: scroll ?
[13:48:12] <shoky> i thought you were asking about a div with overflow: scroll ..
[13:48:31] <lonecub2131> `poo: Thanks for troubleshooting. Sometimes, it takes a second person to point out the issue. A lot of my js code on this project uses jquery tools and omega media queries. So, I had to change the closure parameter from jQuery to $jq for all those libraries.
[13:48:37] <b_52globe> plz any hep with this http://jsfiddle.net/3yQZ6/
[13:48:52] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, 'custom scroll bar'
[13:49:06] <nFFF> shoky, same thing except scroll puts horizontal bar there also
[13:49:08] <shoky> lonecub2131: ah makes sense. (me === `poo)
[13:49:29] <nFFF> Im using overflow:auto; it decides which to use
[13:49:32] <nFFF> (horizontal)
[13:49:52] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/hBgjM/2/
[13:50:24] <shoky> nFFF honestly i have no idea what you are asking
[13:50:51] <shoky> keeping it a single static question would help ;P
[13:50:54] <ryanneufeld> shoky: it looks like he's trying to re-invent scrollable divs
[13:51:28] <shoky> well that's ok if he's making a custom scrollbar plugin, no?
[13:51:58] <nFFF> ryanneufeld ...?
[13:52:17] <nFFF> what part of a custom scrollbar is going over your head? :|
[13:52:51] <javalover> shokyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy WHATUP!
[13:53:10] <nFFF> shoky, Im trying to replace the default scrollbar, with a custom one, for design purposes
[13:53:16] <nFFF> just like you would a text drop down etc
[13:54:32] <javalover> man i've been coding for hours & I finally got this thing working
[13:54:37] <javalover> ]so shoutout to shoky & ummm
[13:55:12] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: what kind of site is this for?
[13:55:14] <javalover> shoutout to max-p for helping me with the link redirects, so awesome
[13:55:18] <shoky> lol hi javalovah
[13:55:22] <javalover> and shoutout to whirl3d cuz he's awesome!
[13:55:38] <javalover> shoky it's so cool I got facebook redirect code
[13:55:44] <ryanneufeld> also nFFF, why re-invent the wheel
[13:55:46] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, im confused :| an ecommerce site, whats that got to do with the code though
[13:56:00] <ryanneufeld> Well, I think it's a stupid ideaa
[13:56:02] <javalover> so like browser say www.mysite.com you click on a pic the pic enlarges & browser say www.mysite.com/mypic.php?helloworld
[13:56:10] <ryanneufeld> if you're building a game, sure, it's gotta look good
[13:56:20] <javalover> and then when you push the back button, it goes back & closes the picture :-)
[13:56:33] <javalover> and of course the links I give will link properly to content yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh BUDDY!
[13:56:50] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: but on a e-commmerce site, you're being user hostile. People expect their browsers to look a certain way, and act a certain way. Why re-invent the wheel?
[13:56:59] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, i wasn't asking for your design opinion, no disrespect
[13:57:06] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, it will behave exactly the same
[13:57:09] <nFFF> just look different...
[13:57:12] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: then why do it?
[13:57:17] <javalover> if anyone wants to do what I just said, these 2 links: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history/   and  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onpopstate
[13:57:22] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: I'm asking cause I'm curious
[13:57:34] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from jquerymobile: Looking for great examples of sites and apps made with jQuery Mobile? Check out http://t.co/ePmrQ8at and http://t.co/xCdPWeYO ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/Pf2Gan
[13:57:35] <nFFF> Im confused, have you never seen a website with custom drop down menus or scrollbars before?
[13:57:42] <nFFF> pretty much every modern site uses them
[13:57:47] <nFFF> just logon to google...
[13:58:00] <javalover> what you do is use history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "bar.html");    and then onpopstate you execute your function call in the case of the back button being pressed.
[13:58:04] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/jquery_custom_scrollbar.html
[13:58:31] <javalover> i wuv you all gonna go shower
[13:58:52] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, yea I seen  some plugins
[13:59:00] <nFFF> figured itd be fun to make my own lighter version
[13:59:02] <b_52globe> plz any hep with this http://jsfiddle.net/3yQZ6/
[13:59:50] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: well, I wish you luck. I would suggest starting with a plugin, and stripping out what you don't need.
[14:01:38] <Max-P> javalover, Lol I didn't really do anything except linking you to the documentation, but glad it helped you :)
[14:05:15] <shoky> nFFF: so what are you asking.. how to do it? :P
[14:05:54] <nFFF> shoky exactly :D
[14:06:03] <nFFF> basically getting the draggable part
[14:06:15] <gaspyr> hello expert shoky :D
[14:06:34] <nFFF> I guess I can use a var and pass it between the two click handlers, 'click' and 'mousemove'
[14:07:13] <shoky> you'd need to handle mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup
[14:07:22] <shoky> with the necessary logic :P
[14:08:45] <shoky> hey gaspyr
[14:09:50] <shoky> fucking jsfiddle
[14:10:15] <diverdude> Hello. Dows anybody know how to make CKEditor save relative paths for images instead of absolute paths?
[14:14:34] <GreekFreak> Could someone please explain to my the logic behind using the theme icons? Am I supposed to do everything myself? I thought that if I had a span and added a .button() then it would work, but I can't style it, and it doesn't change to the active colour when clicked. COuld someone guide me?
[14:15:36] <oberststen> Hey! I'm using a form to upload a file, when there is a submit button it works ok, however if I user $(form).submit() it sends everything but the file, any solution?

[14:16:26] <b_52globe> plz any hep with this http://jsfiddle.net/3yQZ6/
[14:16:40] <nFFF> much more fun to do it yourself :D
[14:16:53] <shoky> nFFF
[14:16:59] <shoky> i just implemented the other half :P
[14:17:02] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hBgjM/4/
[14:17:55] <nFFF> lol sweeet
[14:17:55] <nFFF> :D
[14:18:04] <nFFF> theres your plugin done ryanneufeld
[14:18:04] <shoky> the main trick is having that inner div (scroll-content)
[14:18:16] <shoky> so you can get the full height of the content
[14:18:24] <shoky> otherwise you can only get the clipped height
[14:19:39] <GreekFreak> it's frustrating that it does some things on it's own and not others (like no corners)
[14:22:25] <GreekFreak> anyone?
[14:23:43] <shoky> GreekFreak http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/dbFd9/
[14:23:49] <shoky> whachu wanna do to it?
[14:25:22] <GreekFreak> shoky, I want to make the button smaller
[14:25:58] <GreekFreak> and the .button() js add a span in my code of class="ui-button-text"
[14:27:34] <GreekFreak> shoky, if you change the height and width of the button, the icon doesn't move, and padding and margin don't seem to have any effect
[14:28:08] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: you need to edit the CSS
[14:28:54] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, I'm trying to, but any margins and padding that I edit don't seem to have an effect. And I'm not sure what it is I need to edit
[14:29:46] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: inspecting it with the webkit inspector is a start. Play with things till you see the results you're looking for
[14:29:50] <ryanneufeld> that's all I'd do
[14:31:33] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, I'll carry on fiddling I suppose. Do you know why adding the ui-corner-all class doesn't give me corners? in fact, I have to add the border-radius manually, whearas in the sFiddle that s h o ky sent me he didn't add anything and it has the curves
[14:32:21] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: he's using the jquery UI library, which changes the HTML and adds classes
[14:33:02] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, so am I. this is my code "      %span#communications-btn.edit-btn.ui-state-default.ui-corner-all        %span.ui-icon.ui-icon-pencil
[14:34:09] <ryanneufeld> I have no idea what that is
[14:34:18] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ GreekFreak
[14:34:18] <bot-t> GreekFreak, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:34:24] <scotdb> Looking for some advice on jQuery dataTables editable : particularly the functionality to add a new record backed by a DB.
[14:34:33] <gaspyr> binoculars to read that selector lol
[14:35:25] <scotdb> The info to populate the new row needs to be "derived" rather than a straight copy of the data posted to sAddURL : e.g. one of the table columns is the ID which is generated by the DB.   Can I actually do this ?
[14:36:56] <ryanneufeld> scotdb: I'm assuming you're talking about a plugin of some kind?
[14:37:20] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, take a look (although I'm getting corners here for some reason)
[14:37:22] <GreekFreak> http://jsfiddle.net/SVcNd/
[14:39:05] <Filibustero> hola
[14:40:53] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: Ah, see you're doing it wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SVcNd/1/
[14:41:22] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: all you need is one element, you don't need to create the whole structure, That's what shoky was trying to show you.
[14:42:12] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, OH! I copied my code from the theme roller list at the bottom. I take it to remove the text I simply add text: false ?
[14:43:05] <shoky> heh i just found that too- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/EjHuF/
[14:44:24] <GreekFreak> shoky, ryanneufeld thanks guys.
[14:44:49] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: np, BTW, I read the docs to figure that out. They are pretty good.
[14:45:20] <scotdb> ryanneufeld : yes the dataPages editable plugin :http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/
[14:45:37] <ryanneufeld> scotdb: ah, not familiar with it
[14:45:47] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, I'll make sure I read them twice next time ;)
[14:45:54] <GreekFreak> thanx for the help
[14:46:27] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: I've ran into things were I was like "WTF Y U NO DOC THIS JQUERY UI!!!" Then someone (gnarf I think) was like "Yo, it's right -> THERE"
[14:46:33] <scotdb> ryanneufeld : it is the closest I could find to a database backed editable table (which I need throughout my app in different forms)
[14:46:33] <ryanneufeld> ?ts
[14:47:02] <bot-t> That's Sexual‚Ñ¢
[14:47:13] <ryanneufeld> oh my bot-t, that's not what I meant!
[14:47:18] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, I swear every time I read it I thought I needed more than one element. and so do a lot of bloggers I might add :P
[14:47:19] <ryanneufeld> ?truestory
[14:48:08] <shoky> lol
[14:48:15] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, fyi, the reason I couldn't move my image earlier, was because the .button() was adding _another_ span with class-"ui-button-text" and once I removed the padding on that, then the whole thing was fine :P
[14:48:26] <ryanneufeld> haha
[14:48:29] <GreekFreak> lol
[14:48:35] <ryanneufeld> ?thatfeel

[14:59:44] * shoky loads requiem.js
[15:05:16] <sunbeam> zooming in, on a page with small font content (a lot paragraph content), is this possible some way with jquery or HTML5? I mean zooming in as getting a zoom icon that you can click on the text.
[15:09:17] <nemosupremo> Hi, does anyone know how to "update" a DOM element. For example - a = b. b = c such that now a = c
[15:09:39] <quantegy> what?
[15:09:42] <b_52globe> plz any hep with this http://jsfiddle.net/3yQZ6/
[15:10:57] <nemosupremo> Maybe this is easier, basically I want to replace all the html and attributes of an element
[15:11:00] <LoneStar99> how would I convert --> "var element = document.getElementById(elementId);" --> var element = $(elementId). ??
[15:11:17] <LoneStar99> to jq
[15:11:47] <nemosupremo> I am using backbone where a certain "el" is referenced. I need to be able to update that specific "el" because its already rendered
[15:11:58] <nemosupremo> however I think I might just copy the attributes, then the html
[15:13:50] <quantegy> isn't there a .replace() method?
[15:14:05] <quantegy> just replace $(b) and $(c) with $(a)
[15:14:25] <LoneStar99> quantegy: remove() and add() ??
[15:15:41] <quantegy> hmm that's a possibility
[15:19:51] <quantegy> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[15:21:12] <LoneStar99> sweet
[15:22:16] <quantegy> wow that was hard to find =)
[15:22:17] <shoky> b_52globe: what's the problem?
[15:22:28] <Krambiorix> hi guys, the data string isn't converted to post variables, what can be the problem? http://pastebin.com/aUzNbx7C
[15:22:39] <Max-P> Is it possible to override the sortable() helper in order to keep the original in place and visible? Tried custom helper function, original always hidden =/
[15:22:53] <b_52globe> shoky,  the date that don't display correclt at the x axis
[15:24:36] <Max-P> Krambiorix, try var_dump($_REQUEST) on php's side, it might get passed by get by accident
[15:25:45] <shoky> b_52globe huh? what date
[15:26:10] <b_52globe> shoky,  on the xaxis i'm displaying timestamp
[15:26:19] <b_52globe> i want to convert to normal date
[15:26:28] <shoky> i dont see any timestamps
[15:26:29] <b_52globe> 11/06/2012  and the hour
[15:26:34] <shoky> or dates
[15:26:43] <shoky> the graph is showing fine..
[15:26:59] <Max-P> Found for my own question, need to bind dragstart and make ui.item.show()
[15:27:25] <b_52globe> shoky, m: [["1223989200000","13.1"],["1223992800000","12.9"],["1223996400000","12.8"],["1224000000000","12.8"],["1224003600000","12.7"],["1224007200000","13.2"]]
[15:27:37] <shoky> wat.
[15:27:40] <b_52globe> 1223989200000  is th timestamp
[15:27:43] <b_52globe> the
[15:27:44] <shoky> ok..?
[15:28:06] <Krambiorix> Max-P, same... array(0){}
[15:28:09] <b_52globe> shoky, an i wanna to display in the graph as 10/14/2008 15:00:00 +02:00
[15:28:18] <b_52globe>  10/14/2008 15:00:00
[15:30:28] <b_52globe> am i doing something wrong ?
[15:30:47] <Max-P> Krambiorix, can I see the test page?
[15:31:54] <Krambiorix> Max-P, the PHP?
[15:32:28] <shoky> b_52globe why would you think you're doing something wrong?
[15:32:29] <Max-P> b_52globe, var d = new Date(timestamp); console.log(d.toDateString()); should convert your timestamp into a date object
[15:32:58] <Max-P> Krambiorix, The HTML test page, so I can trace how jquery sends the data to the server
[15:33:01] <shoky> b_52globe the graph shows the data you put in it
[15:33:33] <Krambiorix> Max-P, only this http://pastebin.com/UDNvEB17
[15:36:18] <Max-P> Krambiorix, I meant, can I try the HTML page where it doesn't work? I want to see what the browser actually do with Wireshark
[15:36:56] <Krambiorix> Max-P, that's the last pastebin
[15:37:13] <Krambiorix> Max-P, there i just want to show the post vars
[15:37:44] <b_52globe> ok thanks
[15:37:52] * Max-P facepalm
[15:39:11] <Krambiorix> Max-P, i come from a barbeque with a lot of drinks... Explain it to me as a kid
[15:40:06] <qom2> I'm having some trouble, I've used a script to set a div as a clickable link, in this div there's other link that should lead to other url's, but the script overrides them.. ideas? http://aufdeutsch.co.uk/ it's the top carousel, the transparent white div on the different images, code -> http://pastebin.com/ZK7Hvada
[15:40:57] <Max-P> Krambiorix, I want to test your page on my computer, the REAL page where you actually do your tests, on your server, so I can test MYSELF what the script does right on your server. The page where your ajax script is (don't care about the PHP server side for now)
[15:41:50] <Krambiorix> Max-P, my little script is on my little computer (localhost)
[15:42:36] <granden> If I got a input textfield. Where it says Search... how do I remove that text when a user click in the text-field? Is it with html or do I need javascript for that?
[15:42:38] <BinaryKitten> qom the event function
[15:42:39] <Krambiorix> Max-P,  http://pastebin.com/aUzNbx7C --> the other things are included... Bit hard to post it all..
[15:42:45] <BinaryKitten> it will receive an event object
[15:43:15] <BinaryKitten> on that there is a property (targetElement i think) that will tell you what was actually clicked
[15:43:38] <BinaryKitten> in your parent one, you can check that and if it doensn't match return true
[15:43:41] <BinaryKitten> or something
[15:44:37] <Max-P> qom2, you can also try e.stopPropagation() before window.location=, it seems it's already too late when you return false. Also, maybe the other link just doesn't receive the event
[15:45:59] <Krambiorix> ok Max-P thanks anyways
[15:46:27] <qom2> BinaryKitten: hm, I'll look into that
[15:47:04] <qom2> thanks
[15:47:16] <BinaryKitten> np
[15:47:50] <Max-P> Krambiorix, try setting dataType: 'json'
[15:48:38] <Max-P> shouldn't really do anything, but worth trying I guess
[15:49:03] <scr4ve> Hey folks. I have a security-related question concerning $.get(). The "intelligent guessing" for the dataType allows $.get to run JavaScript in the context of the page if url points to a script file. Isn't this a security issue?
[15:49:54] <scr4ve> I mean if I don't specify datatType manually, I might load data from a different Server (CORS). If this server gets compromised, they have an excellent attack vector for my page.
[15:50:38] <scr4ve> I thought that intelligent guessing would only apply to text/html/xml. Especially considering the fact that a good developer would use $.getScript when loading scripts.
[15:51:07] <Krambiorix> Max-P, :array(0) {\n}
[15:51:22] <scr4ve> Can anyone explain to me why it gets handled this way?
[15:51:26] <Max-P> scr4ve, As it's all on the client side, you can't do much if there's some middleware between the two
[15:52:28] <Max-P> scr4ve, if there's something on the client's computer that changes the URL or the content the server returns, you can't do anything
[15:52:45] <scr4ve> Max-P: That's not the point.
[15:53:30] <scr4ve> If I am loading JS files from server B and server B gets compromised, this also allows the attacker to run JS on the original page.
[15:54:00] <scr4ve> e.g. $.get("/external/api/returning/json/normally")
[15:54:40] <scr4ve> If $externalApi gets compromised, my users can be attacked via $.get
[15:55:34] <scr4ve> My assumption when using $.get is that it loads a page and gives me the content in the callback.
[15:55:45] <scr4ve> Not that it might execute JavaScript
[15:56:01] <sirecote> isn't that always a concern when getting stuff from 3rd parties?
[15:56:08] <Max-P> scr4ve, Then if you fear that you should always set the correct datatype, but anyway your user's data is already compromised if someone take control over your server, no matter how the Javascript side does.
[15:57:04] <Max-P> If you can't control the API server, then your job is to make sure that your client side script reject invalid data such as javascript by overriding the dataType property to 'json'
[15:57:14] <scr4ve> Max-P: Agreed.
[15:57:26] <scr4ve> Maybe it would be a good idea to mention this in the docs.
[15:58:07] <sirecote> input verification has been beaten to death in the realm of programming, if it hasn't taken now, i don't think it ever will ;)
[15:59:13] <Max-P> also, most people use AJAX queries on the same server to reload some dynamic content, and in that case, if the server is compromised, then the whole site will follow, as soon as the user changed the page.
[15:59:14] <sirecote> not that adding it wouldn't be a good idea.
[16:00:39] <scr4ve> Max-P: Yes. Anyway I think that this is a possibly critical behaviour that should be documented more clearly.
[16:01:11] <xarxer> Is it possible to use removeClass() with some "Ends With" selector? I.e. I have classes named "yada_yada_off", and on hover, I'd like to swap _off for _on..
[16:01:49] <scr4ve> xarxer: what about "yada_yada off" ?
[16:02:02] <Max-P> like sirecote said, use should always check the data before, but I agree it could be documented.
[16:02:16] <xarxer> scr4ve: How do you mean?
[16:02:25] <scr4ve> e.g. $(".yadayada.off").removeClass("off").addClass("on")
[16:02:39] <scr4ve> use two separate classes rather than one.
[16:03:18] <xarxer> scr4ve: That wouldn't work, since .yada_yada_off is styled with a specific image, while .bla_bla_off is styled with another image..
[16:03:39] <scr4ve> xarxer: .yada_yada.off is a valid selector
[16:03:47] <scr4ve> Selecting only elements that have both classes.
[16:04:03] <xarxer> scr4ve: hmmm
[16:04:25] <xarxer> scr4ve: Yeah maybe that'll work.. Thanks! :)
[16:04:26] <scr4ve> Max-P: What's the best way to get feedback for this - bugtracker ticket?
[16:05:32] <Max-P> scr4ve, dunno, probably the bugtracker, or at least the comments at the bottom of the documentation page
[16:07:19] <scr4ve> k. Thanks for your feedback! :)
[16:12:39] <zsoc> can you use .ready more than once?
[16:16:42] <Max-P> zsoc, Yes, it will bind two handlers for the .ready function and will be executed one after the other
[16:16:49] <zsoc> Max-P: ty :)
[16:17:34] <Max-P> Its like that for every bind() shortcuts, you can always bind as many handlers as you want
[16:19:34] <ryannielson> No idea if you guys will have any use for this, but I figured I may as well post it anyway. I just made a little Twitter Feed jQuery plugin that someone here may find handy. You can download it at https://github.com/RyanNielson/tweet-feed if you need something like it.
[16:19:45] <zsoc> I'm having a problem where .scrollLeft on .ready doesn't work only in IE. I tried switching $window to $document thinking that would fix it with no success
[16:21:15] <ryannielson> zsoc: I was just about to say try using $window, as I fixed an issue earlier for a client where document wasn't working for the scroll event in IE. But it seems you've tried that already.
[16:21:34] <zsoc> interesting... maybe i'll give it another shot lol
[16:21:54] <savid> Is it possible to listen to only a namespaced event? That is, I only want to listen to "click.foo" and not "click"?
[16:22:10] <ryannielson> zsoc: It was with scroll() though. $(window).scroll() worked in IE while $(document).scroll() didn't.
[16:26:58] <Max-P> savid, Can't you just bind("click.foo")?
[16:28:39] <Max-P> zsoc, Try $('body').scroll(function() {...}) ?
[16:29:23] <zsoc> that's weird. i had to do window.ready but then document.scrollLeft
[16:29:27] <zsoc> i was switching them both
[16:31:24] <savid> Max-P,  if I do $el.on('click.foo', ...), it is triggered on 'click'.  I only want it to trigger on 'click.foo'.
[16:31:37] <ryannielson> zsoc: Haha, weird. At least you got it.
[16:42:44] <coldhead> guten tag
[16:43:01] <Hopsy> hi coldhead
[16:44:36] <coldhead> hi hopsy!
[17:00:45] <qom2> http://jsfiddle.net/xSB8J/1/ ‚Äì clicking "giovanni ‚Ä¶" brings you to the same url as "no comments", why? (they're not the same)
[17:24:04] <shoky> qom2: you put a click event on the whole div
[17:24:16] <qom2> solved it
[17:33:52] <Kunnis> I'm playing with generating some html, I'd like to insert some images that set off some JS when they are added to the dom.  What's the best way of doing that?
[17:34:54] <Kunnis> I'm guessing $.live, but I want to check before I go down the wrong path.
[17:43:19] <shoky> just run that JS when you add them to the dom
[17:43:32] <mfoxdogg|work> can someone give me a hand, why would this event run exponetially, like fiest click, it runs once, second it runs twice, third time it runs 3 times http://jsfiddle.net/rCPGJ/2/
[17:45:19] <shoky> mfoxdogg|work: which of the events runs twice?
[17:45:32] <mfoxdogg|work> the click
[17:45:55] <mfoxdogg|work> which in turn fires the success
[17:46:15] <shoky> there's nothing in that code that indicates the behaviour you describe..
[17:46:52] <mfoxdogg|work> hense why i came here :)
[17:47:20] <shoky> if you're looking for an answer, you'll need to provide more code/details ;P
[17:48:14] <Kunnis> shoky  Humm, well I only want to run the event once when it's added to the dom.  I don't know how many of these elements will be getting added.
[17:48:15] * coldhead np: jakob - controle
[17:48:45] <Kunnis> Maybe I can put a class on the element before it's added, that says it needs to be processed, and once it's processed, remove the class?
[17:49:43] <shoky> Kunnis: there is currently no good way to listen for some "DOM element added" event
[17:50:23] <shoky> Kunnis: so you need to solve it a different way, like what i suggested.. make sure you only run it once if you need to
[17:50:45] <Kunnis> is the putting a "not yet processed" class on the element, and then remove the class sound like a reasonable plan, or is there a better way to prevent double-processing?
[17:51:06] <shoky> what's the purpose of that class?
[17:51:30] <shoky> i didnt full yunderstand what you want
[17:52:02] <shoky> you want for each image, to have something happen when you add it to the dom ?
[17:52:08] <Kunnis> It's image tag, I need to set the source of the img tag in the client-side javascript.  I don't want to double-process elements because there will end up being a lot of images on the page.
[17:52:35] <shoky> why would you double process elements?
[17:52:52] <shinysky> i didn't notice until today if you call live events $("selectlist").live('change', function(){alert('hello')}) twice it will popup the alert message twice? any way to avoid this except using "die"?
[17:53:16] <Kunnis> Because I'll be added the img tags on a timer
[17:53:23] <shoky> shinysky: any event binding (live or not) just adds a handler. so calling it twice will add 2 handlers
[17:53:24] <Kunnis> so I'll add some, wait, add some more
[17:53:44] <shoky> Kunnis: so what? but you want to run the code for each one?
[17:53:58] <Kunnis> each image tag needs the processing done on it once.
[17:54:05] <shoky> so do it once
[17:54:18] <shoky> i dont see the issue
[17:54:45] <Kunnis> How do I target only the images that were added recently?
[17:55:04] <shoky> what :\
[17:55:27] <shoky> if you added them recently, then you're supposed to know which images they are, no ?
[17:55:31] <shoky> you added them, afterall.
[17:55:50] <shoky> you wanna run that JS code only once for the whole batch?
[17:56:34] <Kunnis> Because I'll be added one or more img tags on each timer.  I only want each image processed once.
[17:56:54] <Kunnis> so each time I add img tags, I'll go through, find all unprocessed images, and process them
[17:58:03] <shoky> why not process each image just after you add it?
[17:58:21] <shoky> or process a whole batch after you just added it?
[17:59:22] <shoky> if you wanted to process a whole batch at once, sometime after adding it, then using a class as you suggested is an ok solution
[17:59:41] <shoky> pasta_tiem.
[17:59:50] <Kunnis> Yeah, I'm doing some async processing, so that's why I want to do it after.

[20:24:35] <Max-P> +1 for the last song ^^
[20:27:07] <Max-P> Hey guys, I have something that is puzzeling me about object concept in JS. I have a three-level container which all of them are objects. Is there a way to pass the first level container to each objects without supplying it in the constructor or using a global for that? Mostly for config access in my app =/
[20:29:41] <coldhead> need to see the code to grasp what you're trying to do i think
[20:35:28] <Max-P> coldhead, it's kind of splitted in 10 files about 500 lines each, you sure? :P I will summarize: Having the main App class, Calendar, which holds a huge calendar. Each day has some properties, notes and tasks. Each Task is an object. Tasks are all jquery.ui.sortable. The Calendar app have a few options, that I need to access in both Days and Tasks, and also some grouping structure in Calendar.
[20:36:00] <Max-P> was kind of a general question, I can stick to globals, it's not a C++ app, there won't be more than one instance of it in a page
[20:38:21] <coldhead> its not something i'm expert in
[20:38:32] <coldhead> the solution we have at this shop sucks dog's balls
[20:38:56] <Max-P> I'm probably pushing Javascript a lil bit to it's maximum
[20:39:16] <coldhead> there are a bunch of interesting reads on how to structure JS apps
[20:39:56] <coldhead> these being foremost in my mind http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide1 and http://addyosmani.com/blog/large-scale-jquery/
[20:40:15] <coldhead> but it depends on your needs and your structure
[20:40:24] <abjorn> UNF UNF UNF UNF UNF
[20:40:27] <coldhead> globals is probably simplest and most readable
[20:40:31] <coldhead> but don't tell anyone i said that
[20:41:22] <abjorn> Max-P: That doesn't sound like pushing JS to it's max. My current project at work is about 25 files, many of which are over 1000 lines. The largest is about 5,500
[20:41:46] <abjorn> because YEEEAAAH PROJECT WITH RIDICULOUSLY LARGE SCOPE
[20:42:43] <shoky> if you define the "root" object before
[20:42:47] <shoky> oops
[20:43:56] <shoky> no idea if anything was said cause i got d/c'd, but i was gonna say one way is: var o = {}; $.extend(o, {a:{root:o, b:{root:o, c:{root:o, data:7}}}})
[20:44:06] <shoky> @ Max-P
[20:44:54] <shoky> maybe that's what you meant with global tho, dono
[20:45:38] <Max-P> I was talking about structure, JS doesn't have any class inheritance system, it's all emulation with closures and some libs
[20:46:23] <systemfault> Anyway :P With a bit of chance, we'll soon get Dart :P
[20:46:35] <systemfault> After that.. no more JS for me.
[20:46:37] <Max-P> Still work nicely for now, and the double link problem, I also have it in Java and C++
[20:47:19] <Max-P> abjorn, Wasn't talking about the size, I meant, the actual code structure without abusing hacks and extra libs
[20:48:36] <Max-P> shoky, I have a root object, which is an instance of the Calendar thing. I wondered if there was a way to access it without having to either a) make the instance in the global scope so childs can access or b), pass the "this" instance to every child object
[20:49:11] <coldhead> Dart won't be ready in our lifetimes
[20:49:32] <systemfault> coldhead: I'm sure it will, 2013 at most
[20:49:48] <coldhead> and which IE version?
[20:49:51] <coldhead> :P
[20:49:58] <systemfault> I don't know...
[20:50:06] <systemfault> Depends if they target ES3 or ES5 :(
[20:50:08] <shoky> sorry, too dead to think of an answer. goodnight ;p
[20:50:26] <systemfault> If ES3 then IE already supports it.
[20:50:35] <systemfault> If not.. IE9 and later
[20:50:42] <systemfault> shoky: Bonne nuit monsieur
[20:50:49] <Max-P> Dart is a compiler, so it could in thery target both
[20:50:52] <Max-P> shoky, 'night :)
[20:51:54] <systemfault> Max-P: It's not just a compiler, chrome will eventually natively support it
[20:52:06] <Max-P> It's might annoy me to compile a language into another language
[20:52:25] <systemfault> There's already a native implementation, they call it dartium
[20:52:41] <Max-P> yeah was going to bring that point, it browsers can speak Dart, that would be a HUGE improvement
[20:52:48] <systemfault> So you could develop on chrome using the native tools then compile to ES5 for other browsers
[20:53:05] <systemfault> Other browser vendors don't want it.
[20:53:07] <Max-P> next step, make a markup language that doesn't need to be <div><div><div><div><div><div><div>something</div></div></div></div></div></div>
[20:53:27] <systemfault> I wish google will be powerful enough to force them to implement it.
[20:54:38] <Max-P> If it becomes widespread, they probably won't have the choice anyway
[20:55:43] <coldhead> the same can be said for the AIDS epidemic
[20:55:52] <Max-P> just like the browser war between netscape and IE at that time, both copied each-other to be compatible with new sites
[20:56:16] <Max-P> Wasn't that greate after all, now we are stuck with IE ><
[22:24:59] <joaojeronimo> Guys I'm trying to do CORS with $.ajax and I'm getting "Origin http://localhost:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." but I am sure the request is being pre-flighted (I see an OPTIONS request just before and it returns a header that says Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://localhost:8000).... Yesterday I was using reqwest for this same piece of code and it worked fine... Where can I find concise information on how to de
[22:24:59] <joaojeronimo> al with CORS using $.ajax ?
[22:27:33] <joaojeronimo> this is the code I was using: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1075914/
[22:27:38] <LoneStar99> have the following how would I have it send ajax reuest every 30 seconds? http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/snAwW/
[22:28:33] <joaojeronimo> LoneStar99, just put that inside setInterval(function(){ /*HERE*/ }, 30000)
[22:29:16] <joaojeronimo> LoneStar99, just like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7YAvu/
[22:29:20] <LoneStar99> joaojeronimo:  oh ok let me try that
[22:39:17] <coldhead> languid
[23:04:48] * tumbleweed` blows through
[23:16:51] <BinaryKitten> (function($) { $('#coldhead').replaceWith('#tumbleweed').trigger('doinirc', 'blowsthrough').replaceWith('#colhead'); })(jQuery);
[23:21:12] <Chel> question: how can i create a chain of steps with jQuery ? i want simulate several user clicks by $(div).click() one by one
[23:26:41] <coldhead> appreciate it, BK
[23:27:05] <coldhead> Chel: something like this? http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[23:32:30] <Chel> coldhead: is it you PaulIrish ?
[23:33:08] <juha_> he's the upsidedown paulirish
[23:36:15] <coldhead> i am much less interesting than paul_irish
[23:36:27] <coldhead> he smells much nicer too
[23:40:55] <sviatovigt> hi
[23:41:06] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me with a small problem?
[23:41:13] <sviatovigt> I want to add an element on a page and display it with a slideDown effect
[23:41:20] <sviatovigt> what should be the initial state of the element?
[23:41:27] <sviatovigt> I have tried height: 0px;
[23:41:33] <sviatovigt> display: none;
[23:41:37] <sviatovigt> visibility: hidden
[23:41:46] <sviatovigt> but it doesn't work
[23:43:15] <defaultro> coldhead, you there
[23:44:01] <defaultro> coldhead, should I read a book first on Javascript before attending training like the one you recommended the other day, Bocoup?
[23:46:26] <juha_> defaultro: i would suggest not reading but doing and studying. get your hands dirty
[23:46:46] <coldhead> defaultro: the more you know before you go in, the better, defaultro
[23:47:00] <coldhead> but they'll school you in any case
[23:47:22] <coldhead> i think you could read Eloquent Javascript (and play with the code along the way)
[23:48:42] <coldhead> to good effect
[23:49:53] <coldhead> defaultro: you should PM ben_alman sometime when he's not asleep. he does the training for bocoup and can tell you the dealio
[23:50:06] <coldhead> he's also a beautiful human being
[23:53:41] <coldhead> sviatovigt: display:none alone should suffice
[23:58:28] <mindis|wurk> hmm, strange bug suddenly appeared. when using slideUp my element was left with style="display: block;" after completion. had to manually remove it in the callback
[23:58:50] <mindis|wurk> umh, sorry, slideDown
[23:59:04] <coldhead> that's how animations work, mindis|wurk
[23:59:15] <coldhead> it is ever thus
[23:59:25] <mindis|wurk> hmmh, haven't had this problem before
