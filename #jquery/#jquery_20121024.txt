[00:00:03] <Cork> $('#mydivid .myotherdiv img') then
[00:00:10] <guideX> cool thx
[00:00:12] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Visit the website, open JS console or similar. The slider functionality is reduced or impaired, the error is Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded but it's detecting this error on prototype.js, which leads me to believe I might not have established the noConflict correctly (view-source: line 221)
[00:00:21] <dblosevn> guidex: div#theid div.class img
[00:00:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: by slider are you talking about the slideshow?
[00:00:41] <guideX> I will try both approaches, thx
[00:00:48] <Cork> (slider is a ui widget)
[00:00:57] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Yes, nivo slider at the top
[00:01:01] <Cork> ok
[00:01:12] <Cork> that explains why i didn't find what you where talking about :)
[00:01:15] <fRAiLtY-> But I don't think it's a fault with that, I think it's my noConflict declaration
[00:01:51] <fRAiLtY-> As it shouldn't conflict at any point with prototype.js unless I've set the var incorrectly etc?
[00:02:03] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: something in your page is going into an infinite loop
[00:04:01] <Cork> --
[00:04:02] <Cork> [09:03:45.377] too much recursion @ http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/js/prototype/prototype.js:881
[00:04:05] <Cork> so ya its prototype
[00:04:12] <raj> is $.type more reliable than typeof?
[00:04:26] <Cork> raj: yes, but much MUCH slower
[00:04:51] <raj> what's the best way to put a string in an array if it isn't already?
[00:04:58] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: prototype goes nuts each time the slideshow loops
[00:06:01] <Cork> raj: if(!$.inArray('exist', arr)) { arr.push('exist'); }
[00:06:25] <Cork> hmm should prob not typecase that
[00:06:34] <Cork> raj: if($.inArray('exist', arr) === -1) { arr.push('exist'); }
[00:06:50] <raj> but the `arr` may be a string
[00:06:57] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  So it's possible my jQuery selector ($$) conflicts with prototype?
[00:07:04] <Cork> $.isArray(arr) then
[00:07:24] <raj> got it, thank you :)
[00:07:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: dig into the slideshow and makesure its always wrapped in (function($) {})(jQuery)
[00:08:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but really, your better of just ditching prototype all together
[00:08:31] <Cork> its a sucky framework anyway
[00:08:51] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I can't it's the heart and soul of Magento, a framework I'm forced to use.
[00:08:57] <Cork> (the creators of it doens't even use it anymore)
[00:09:19] <raj> arguments to a function don't need to be declared if I'm redefining them, correct?
[00:09:21] <iaj> When I want to have a .slideToggle() on a 'div.foobar' after the page has been up (that means loaded) for 5 sec.. How would I most commonly do that?
[00:09:40] <Cork> raj: what do you mean?
[00:09:54] <Cork> raj: if they'r declared they'r declared
[00:10:25] <Cork> ugg, those two nicks are just too similar >_<'
[00:10:29] <raj> function testing(somearg) { if (!$.isArray(somearg)) somearg=[somearg]}
[00:10:40] <raj> lol
[00:11:03] <advorak> I have a radio button object, in each of which I'd like to store an array of integers for future reference.  What's the best way to store this data in the radio button object?
[00:11:18] <advorak> I have a group of radio button objects, rather*
[00:11:23] <Cork> ?.data @ advorak
[00:11:23] <bot-t> advorak, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:12:47] <advorak> thanks, Cork.  I didn't realize .data could store anything other than text.  Great! :-)
[00:17:10] <lazyfingers> hello. I replace tds in a tr like that. row_obj.html('<td>...</td><td>...</td>...'); After I do that css breaks and new cells appear squeezed on the left side on the row. How do I fix that? Thanks in advance.
[00:19:00] <dns-away>  $(this).replaceWith( "<div>" + $(this).text() + "</div>" );
[00:23:16] <advorak> Cork, is there an easy way to store similar data in html (not in javascript) so that it's accessible in the same way using javascript? (ie. storing an array)
[00:24:28] <advorak> Cork, I think I answered my question using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4287462/store-and-use-an-array-using-the-html-data-tag-and-jquery .. :-)
[00:25:04] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I've swapped to jQuery() as my selector, established noConflict, checked my JS is in (function($){//code})(jQuery) and am getting a maximum stack exceeded, but it doesn't mention prototype anymore? http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/
[00:27:25] <Cork> advorak: html entity escape json and put it in data-<object name> on the element
[00:27:36] <advorak> thanks.
[00:28:37] <Cork> ex. <span data-info="{&quot;key&quot;=&quot;value&quot;}">span</span>
[00:29:12] <Cork> advorak: and if you don't want to store structured data you can just put it as strings directly
[00:29:22] <Cork> ex. <span data-key="value">span</span>
[00:31:38] <lazyfingers> dns-away, thanks
[00:34:21] <advorak> thanks!
[00:40:15] <bastetmilo> hi, I have little script http://pastebin.com/rcUnaVM7 - that slides some stuff right to left in wrapper div. I works beautifull - but I can slide it to left/or right to infinity. And I cant get how to set limit - I tried to check value of margin-left - but it check it only one, and that value is changing with clicks. Can anyone help me?
[00:44:48] <Cork> ?demo @ bastetmilo
[00:44:49] <bot-t> bastetmilo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:46:10] <Myx0x3> im creating (.html()) an div before i submit an form ("loading.." div) but when i press back in my browser it appear! is it better to hide and show the div then create it?
[00:53:32] <bastetmilo> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/cwhsN/
[00:54:42] <s0u][ight> hello, i'm writing a firefox addon, using jquery i would like to select the button right after the input fields for the login credentials (to trigger a click event on it), what would be the correct selector? https://blackboard.ua.ac.be/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp (there's a frameset on the page with 2 frames in it, the button is in the second frame)
[00:55:54] <Cork> bastetmilo: in the click event check if margin-left > 0 to allow scroll left
[00:56:18] <Cork> sorry < 0 not > :)
[00:56:54] <Cork> bastetmilo: and on scroll right check that margin-left > -width
[00:58:44] <bastetmilo> Cork: OK.
[01:01:40] <code_ph0y> hey guys ... can someone tell me if there is a known ie error when using the ajax .done() function
[01:02:15] <GoSox> If I have a bunch of $.get 's that i call at the same time, is there a limit to how many will actually run simultaneously? Meaning the rest will get queued until the first ones finish, even though such a queue is not in my own code?
[01:02:28] <code_ph0y> seriously I think am gonna create a site called "please microsoft just give up"
[01:02:46] <Cork> GoSox: yes, that depends on the browser
[01:02:51] <GoSox> code_ph0y: :D http://www.menulizard.com/browser-upgrade/
[01:02:57] <Cork> GoSox: but its normally 5 now days if i remember correctly
[01:03:04] <GoSox> hmmm
[01:03:05] <Cork> (was 2 a few years back)
[01:03:30] <Cork> GoSox: and thats actual connections to the servers, so loading images, css, js and the like consumes one of them
[01:04:08] <GoSox> these $.gets would all be running after the page loads, and they will be loading PHPs that can take a few seconds to run
[01:04:28] <GoSox> the way it works now, you have to wait for all ~30 to run, then you get all results at once
[01:04:53] <GoSox> but it may be nicer to do each get independently so they return faster
[01:04:56] <GoSox> or at least, some return faster
[01:05:09] <Cork> one alternative is to create subdomains and distribute the calls cross them
[01:05:22] <GoSox> yeah not worth that much effor
[01:05:24] <GoSox> t
[01:05:25] <code_ph0y> GoSox: Thanks for this you know I hate microsoft that much am just gonna use it!
[01:05:51] <Cork> GoSox: doesn't have to be that much work, they can all point to the same server
[01:05:57] <GoSox> code_ph0y: each of my two biggest sites have those pages, all IE6 & 7 on one site, and 6, 7 and 8 users get sent there automatically
[01:06:03] <GoSox> Cork: oh i know
[01:06:07] <GoSox> but still
[01:06:12] <GoSox> we're just talking about a port scanner :)
[01:06:15] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/server/
[01:06:50] <Cork> GoSox: well its a hard limit set by old server hosters, to not ddos the servers
[01:06:51] <Myx0x3> how do i hide an div when useing the history back button in the browser? :(
[01:07:59] <GoSox> Cork: here's a question. If i have say 30 $.gets on a page, and they are queueing up and getting run 5 at a time, and some will finish almost instantly, some will take 2 seconds or so to time out. And they are all async, so how can I know when the last one as finished?
[01:08:04] <Cork> GoSox: when they raised the limit from 2 to 5 there was quite a bit outroar :)
[01:08:10] <code_ph0y> Nice GoSox thanks!
[01:08:23] <Cork> GoSox: you can't
[01:08:33] <Cork> GoSox: it depends on witch call queued first
[01:09:02] <Cork> as the rest will be on hold until one of the other have finnised
[01:09:42] <Cork> so if your unlucky and the slow one comes fist the rest have to wait 2 seconds before they can even make the call
[01:10:06] <GoSox> Cork: i could set a global variable = 0, and then have each individual $.get increment the global when finished, and then do my "end" function if the global is equal to the total number of $gets, which I will know ahead of time
[01:10:55] <Cork> GoSox: or you can have it make calls++ when it starts and calls-- when they complete
[01:11:08] <Cork> and when its 0 you know theres no calls in queue
[01:11:09] <GoSox> i don't know what you mean
[01:11:17] <GoSox> oh i see what you mean
[01:11:53] <GoSox> but in theory, if 5 started and finished at the exact same time, the completion function could be called early that way, no?
[01:12:04] <GoSox> its unlikely but this page gets many thousands of hits per day
[01:12:13] <code_ph0y> GoSox LMAO
[01:12:17] <GoSox> ?
[01:12:30] <Cork> GoSox: not if you just make all the .get calls at once
[01:12:43] <code_ph0y> i love that the page has border-radius in it and that won't work on ms browsers lol
[01:12:45] <Cork> cause then you know that when it hits 0 there is no queue
[01:13:02] <GoSox> code_ph0y: yeah looks pretty on real browsers though :)
[01:13:12] <code_ph0y> true dat!
[01:13:28] <GoSox> Cork: i see what you're saying, the variable incrementing will all run at the same time, its only the actualy GET command that wil get queued
[01:13:39] <Cork> yes
[01:13:42] <GoSox> code_ph0y: same page on my other site http://www.whatsmyip.org/browser-upgrade/
[01:13:45] <Cork> and the callbacks
[01:13:52] <GoSox> Cork: still, i like my way better, because i thought of it :)
[01:13:57] <Cork> lol
[01:13:59] <GoSox> although they are essentially the same way
[01:14:03] <Cork> ya
[01:14:17] <code_ph0y> wow you created that stie?
[01:14:20] <GoSox> im going to have to whip up a test page and see if it feels more usable doing 30 separate gets
[01:14:20] <s0u][ight> is this valid jquery?
[01:14:21] <s0u][ight> $("frame[name = 'content'] input[class = 'submit button-1'").click();
[01:14:23] <code_ph0y> site*
[01:14:27] <GoSox> code_ph0y: yep
[01:14:37] <code_ph0y> i use that all the time man!
[01:14:40] <GoSox> awesome
[01:14:42] <GoSox> keep using it
[01:14:45] <GoSox> tell your friends
[01:15:01] <code_ph0y> nice to meet you bud! good work!
[01:15:05] <Cork> s0u][ight: it is, though its a bad idea
[01:15:12] <GoSox> code_ph0y: change your browser's user agent to IE6 and try to visit the sight :D
[01:15:14] <GoSox> site*
[01:15:38] <Cork> s0u][ight: $("frame[name='content'] input.submit.button-1).click(); is a better option
[01:15:44] <Cork> opps
[01:15:53] <Cork> s0u][ight: * $("frame[name='content'] input.submit.button-1").click();
[01:16:36] <s0u][ight> Cork: if the input isn't a direct child of the frame, will it still select that input with this code?
[01:16:46] <Cork> yes
[01:17:11] <Cork> s0u][ight: direct child selectors are form > input
[01:17:20] <s0u][ight> isn't working :(
[01:17:33] <Cork> wait a min
[01:17:35] <Cork> frame??
[01:17:48] <GoSox> bedtime
[01:17:48] <Cork> you can't select cross documents
[01:18:18] <Cork> s0u][ight: $("frame[name='content']").contents().find("input.submit.button-1").click();
[01:18:59] <s0u][ight> :( still not working
[01:19:22] <aaairc> how would you guys getting the current time where the user is located... vs where the server is located?
[01:19:35] <s0u][ight> Cork: but it brings me on an idea, can't i do a page-mod for the frame-url?
[01:20:06] <seutje> ?g mdn date @ aaairc
[01:20:08] <bot-t> aaairc, Date - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[01:20:57] <Cork> s0u][ight: page-mod?
[01:21:41] <Cork> s0u][ight: is your js running in the frame container page?
[01:22:01] <Cork> s0u][ight: (i know thats the wrong term, but i haven't used frames for over 8 years)
[01:22:17] <s0u][ight> Cork: i'm writing an addon, js is running in the page-mod module
[01:22:37] <Cork> s0u][ight: then you might have other rules applying to you
[01:22:52] <Cork> s0u][ight: better ask in the browsers development channel
[01:22:58] <s0u][ight> i've attached jquery library to it, so i could more easily select that button, but it isn't working
[01:23:08] <Cork> *browsers extension development channel
[01:23:20] <s0u][ight> ok thanks
[01:24:15] <seutje> s0u][ight: you'll prolly have to wait till the frame is loaded before you can query it
[01:24:46] <s0u][ight> seutje: page-mod is set to run once the document is loaded
[01:24:57] <seutje> s0u][ight: oh ok, nevermind me
[01:25:09] <s0u][ight> thanks anyway :)
[01:25:19] <Cork> s0u][ight: page-mod doesn't mean anything out of context of what browser this is for
[01:25:39] <s0u][ight> firefox addon module
[01:25:46] <s0u][ight> to be specific
[01:26:01] <Cork> ah, you would have to inject the code on the page
[01:26:13] <Cork> but anyway ask in there extension channel
[01:26:19] <Cork> its not jquery related
[01:27:10] <Cork> s0u][ight: #jetpack @ irc.mozilla.org
[01:27:26] <s0u][ight> mkay, heading to mibbit atm
[01:27:28] <s0u][ight> thanks
[01:30:29] <pluffsy> hi
[01:31:27] <pluffsy> are anybody using http://www.screwdefaultbuttons.com/ to customize checkboxes? I can't get it to work in explorer (9), the checkboxes looks right but they are not passed on when the form is submitted. I can't for my life understand what is wrong.
[01:34:09] <bastetmilo> Cork: THANKS. It is working :)
[01:34:29] <Cork> :)
[01:36:48] <aga> Hello all! When if do the find() to find IMG tag, the .html() tries to fetch the inside of that tag. Is there a way I can place the whole IMG tag into a variable?
[01:37:10] <aga> I need to find IMG tag and place it into a variable that is
[01:38:17] <xec_> aga: the html string? may i ask what for? (it is a sign of doing things in a roundabout way)
[01:39:03] <aga> xec: I have an iframe in one place, and I need to copy the IMG tag as it is inside the iframe to another location
[01:41:45] <xec_> aga: you can probably use .clone() for that
[01:42:18] <xec_> aga: check out http://jsfiddle.net/9eRW3/ - is something like that what you're trying to do?
[01:43:56] <xec_> assuming you're able to access the dom node at all
[01:44:27] <xec_> aga: contol question: is the iframe served from the same domain as the host page?
[01:45:31] <s0u][ight> Cork: using javascript  to select the form and do a .submit() doesn't work, any idea why?
[01:45:42] <aga> xec: yes
[01:45:44] <s0u][ight> i mean, the server responds with "wrong credentials"
[01:46:03] <Cork> s0u][ight: does it depends on http auth?
[01:46:22] <xec_> good, should be possible then
[01:46:24] <s0u][ight> https://mail.ua.ac.be/owa/auth/logon.aspx?replaceCurrent=1&reason=2&url=https%3a%2f%2fmail.ua.ac.be%2fowa%2f this is the website
[01:46:29] <sbugzu> .classpath
[01:46:29] <sbugzu> .settings
[01:46:29] <sbugzu> .project
[01:47:23] <Cork> s0u][ight: ah, is the fields changed correctly?
[01:47:40] <anli> A table that is within a div, can it have any width?
[01:47:52] <s0u][ight> Cork: without the submit code, (manually entering) the field values seem to be alright
[01:47:57] <Cork> anli: yes
[01:48:18] <anli> Would be nice if I could have the table not go outside its parent
[01:48:27] <Cork> s0u][ight: and the values are in the fields before you do the submit?
[01:48:33] <Cork> s0u][ight: or are you doing the submit on load?
[01:48:39] <Cork> (that would be too early)
[01:48:57] <anli> But table-layout: fixed together with width cant be used, I dont know about the width
[01:48:57] <Cork> anli: make the parent overflow: hidden;
[01:48:59] <s0u][ight> 2 first lines of code set those values, 3rd line submits the form
[01:49:13] <anli> Cork: I dont want to hide any parts of the table
[01:49:27] <anli> I want the table to not go wider
[01:49:52] <Cork> anli: if you make the table 100% width and its parent has overflow that should work
[01:50:13] <anli> Then the parent will not have any use of its overflow, right?
[01:50:26] <Cork> no that creates an offset
[01:50:32] <anli> ok
[01:50:38] <anli> cool
[01:50:52] <anli> The table can have a left other than 0px unfortunately
[01:51:10] <Cork> you could make it width: auto
[01:51:21] <Cork> ah, no
[01:51:24] <Cork> left wouldn't affect that
[01:51:26] <anli> trying
[01:51:30] <Cork> margin-left would though
[01:51:31] <anli> thanks a bunch cork
[01:51:35] <Cork> np
[01:51:38] <anli> Cork with capital C, sorry
[01:51:41] <anli> ;)
[01:57:38] <trari> hi, i made a calendar with jquery/jqueryui where you can drag and drop a season and drag the dropped season in the calender to make larger/smaller. while dragging the season is painted. my prolem is that i need either the element the helper is snapped to or the mouseposition ignoring the helper element to get the day i'm currently dragging over. if i try to get the snappedTo Elements it returns an Array with all Elements it can snap to but not
[01:57:38] <trari> the day it is currently snapped to.
[02:07:46] <aga> I'm not getting this to work. I have the following: <a href="dfgdfg.html"><img src="kjkj.jpg"></a>
[02:08:03] <aga> how do I get the <a> tag and it's childs into a variable?
[02:08:15] <Cork> you mean the html?
[02:08:22] <aga> Cork: yes
[02:08:43] <aga> if I do .find('a').html() then I only get the IMG tag
[02:08:45] <Cork> $('<div/>').html($('a').clone()).html()
[02:09:04] <Cork> there is no cross browser way to get the elements html
[02:09:48] <Lucky--> what are you trying to do
[02:10:05] <Lucky--> you could just $("a")
[02:10:10] <Lucky--> and then iterate through the descendants
[02:10:15] <Cork> Lucky--: that won't grab the html
[02:10:27] <Lucky--> iterate through the descendants with .html()
[02:10:35] <aga> I have a link with an image in one portion of the html, I need to copy the a tag and it's img content to another place
[02:10:36] <Lucky--> $(this).html()
[02:10:44] <Cork> that would be the same as running .html on the first target
[02:10:55] <Lucky--> not if you are iterating through the descendants
[02:10:57] <Cork> Lucky--: that woun't give you the html of the a tag
[02:11:18] <Cork> it will give you the html of the content of the a tags
[02:11:34] <Lucky--> ah i see, u want the actual raw content
[02:11:57] <Cork> no he wants the html for the a tag and all its children
[02:12:56] <aga> Lucky--: yes
[02:12:58] <aga> http://pastebin.com/G5xUcFJB
[02:13:10] <Lucky--> $(â€‹a).raw().appendTo("#out");â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
[02:13:18] <Lucky--> err
[02:13:36] <Cork> aga: you can't run html on the a tag
[02:13:42] <Cork> that will just give you the innerHTML
[02:14:00] <Cork> you need to create a container element, append the clone and grab its innerHTML
[02:14:10] <Cork> that is => $('<div/>').html($('a').clone()).html()
[02:14:46] <Cork> or for your code => $('<div/>').html(ad.find('a').clone()).html()
[02:15:36] <Cork> aga: remember though, if you want to add it back to the dom again, you don't want to convert it to html
[02:17:04] <aga> $('a') gets an a element from the whole document, not the instance I am using
[02:17:35] <Lucky--> yay to refactoring my project and decoupling as much crap as possible
[02:17:35] <Cork> aga: that was just example code
[02:17:39] * Lucky-- sighs
[02:18:07] <Cork> aga: the important point is the  $('<div/>').html().html()
[02:18:50] <Lucky--> you could call .parent().html()
[02:18:51] <Lucky--> :-)
[02:19:04] <Lucky--> that would be equivalent to outerHtml
[02:19:05] <Cork> that would export all the content of the parent element
[02:19:08] <Cork> no
[02:19:26] <Cork> you don't know how much more elements are in the parent element
[02:19:41] <Cork> you could get divs form input and what not
[02:19:56] <Myx0x3> why does not my code execute the code when i use the back button?
[02:20:12] <Myx0x3> it caches, somehow
[02:20:44] <Cork> Myx0x3: what is "my code"?
[02:21:06] <Myx0x3> my $(document).ready(function() {});
[02:21:21] <coppa> you may have a hash/history state  listener
[02:21:27] <Cork> your using any history features?
[02:21:34] <Myx0x3> Cork: no
[02:21:56] <Cork> only reason i can think of is that the page isn't unloaded
[02:22:19] <Cork> browsers try to keep the page around for a little while to make back fast
[02:22:22] <coppa> Myx0x3: Cork is right, are you sure you load new page ?
[02:22:32] <Myx0x3> hmm okay.. well, im useing .submit()
[02:22:56] <Myx0x3> im not sure how it works
[02:23:11] <Cork> Myx0x3: your submitting through ajax or normal full page reload?
[02:23:27] <Myx0x3> Cork: im submitting thrue .submit()..
[02:23:30] <Cork> (.submit() dcan do both)
[02:23:30] <Myx0x3> is it ajax?
[02:23:32] <Cork> *can
[02:23:40] <Cork> inpossible to tell
[02:23:42] <Myx0x3> i dont use any paremeters
[02:23:44] <Cork> impossible even
[02:23:51] <Myx0x3> parameters*
[02:24:01] <Cork> it depends on if the form has any event listeners that convert it to ajax
[02:24:20] <Myx0x3> i want to show an "Loading.." div, so users know its searching (it take a while)
[02:24:26] <Cork> Myx0x3: simplest is to check the network console
[02:24:44] <Cork> if it displays that its an xhr reqiest its ajax
[02:24:58] <Myx0x3> then i guess its ajax
[02:25:08] <Cork> (the header X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest)
[02:25:33] <Cork> Myx0x3: then if you can use back without leaving the page, your using history modifications
[02:25:33] <dblosevn> Cork: or not I have displayed a loading div while doing a normal post before for pages that take a while to load eg... paypal redirects
[02:25:43] <Cork> Myx0x3: and then you won't get a reload of the page
[02:25:58] <dblosevn> Cork: binding a form.submit listner showing the div and retrurning true
[02:26:15] <Cork> dblosevn: i never said that wasn't a possiblility
[02:26:31] <Myx0x3> Cork: yeah, because when i reload the result page and use back i dont have the problem.. so i guess i have to reload the result page?
[02:26:34] <dblosevn> so we still dont know if hes using ajax lol
[02:26:35] <Cork> dblosevn: just that its impossible to tell what happens just from the fact that he's calling .submit()
[02:27:22] <Cork> Myx0x3: check the submission package in the browsers network tab
[02:27:30] <Cork> Myx0x3: and check what header it submits
[02:27:41] <smftre> offtopic: where could I find some beta test users for a new service?
[02:27:49] <Cork> Myx0x3: start by verifying what your doing
[02:28:27] <dblosevn> Cork: will dom ready fire on back button press if the page was 100% cached?
[02:28:41] <Cork> dblosevn: yes
[02:28:45] <aaronmcadam> that'd be a handy feature
[02:28:57] <Cork> its called by the browser when it has parsed the html
[02:29:03] <Cork> it has nothing to do with cache
[02:29:14] <Myx0x3> Cork: does safari have the network thingie?
[02:29:19] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:29:22] <dblosevn> lol
[02:29:29] <aaronmcadam> you mean a web inspector?
[02:29:31] <Cork> dblosevn: only situation if won't be called is if the page isn't unloaded (the dom isn't thrown away)
[02:29:41] <Cork> Myx0x3: donno, never used it much
[02:29:55] <Cork> its the browser i test least of all
[02:30:02] <dblosevn> ya, thats what i was referring to chrome goes back way to fast on occassion and makes no network requests
[02:30:03] <aaronmcadam> I'd hope a browser has at least one "network thingie"
[02:30:04] <Myx0x3> aaronmcadam: no, im not that stupid
[02:30:15] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: yes you have to enable it in preferences
[02:30:31] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: what is it called?
[02:30:43] <aaronmcadam> Myx0x3: what do you mean by thingie then?
[02:30:49] <aaronmcadam> proxy settings?
[02:30:53] <Cork> the little i've used safari its never been for developing
[02:31:02] <Myx0x3> aaronmcadam: ubmission package in the browsers network tab
[02:31:05] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: preferences, advanced, show devlop menu
[02:31:09] <Cork> aaronmcadam: the network tracking tab
[02:31:09] <smftre> it's for closing..
[02:31:16] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[02:31:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah web inspector
[02:31:33] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: well, ive used the inspector in safari over 1 years i think, but never used "submission package in the browsers network tab"
[02:31:35] <Myx0x3> what that is
[02:31:36] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: then just right click on something on the page and click inspect element
[02:31:53] <Myx0x3> i think i found it tho
[02:32:12] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: then click the network tab and look at the request
[02:32:31] <Myx0x3> english is not my native language, so i dont have it in english :( Safari is useing the native language..
[02:32:41] <dblosevn> chorome inspectors and safari inspector are exactly the same
[02:32:54] <aaronmcadam> that's not true
[02:32:57] <truedon> Hey guys, I am reloading a page with address plugin and I need to have chosen activated on a drop down. I can call the function to do that on the initial page load and it works fine, but when I am refreshing the page I cannot find how to make it re-draw. I call chosen again, it runs with out error but nothing happens to the display
[02:33:02] <aaronmcadam> chrome dev tools pisses all over safari
[02:33:07] <dblosevn> down to the icons used and everything
[02:33:14] <aaronmcadam> safari's is a bit overly pretty and not as useful
[02:33:18] <aaronmcadam> that's not right
[02:33:27] <aaronmcadam> have you looked at it recently?
[02:33:35] <dblosevn> looking at them side by side
[02:33:42] <dblosevn> chrome latest and safari latest
[02:34:02] <truedon> aaronmcadam:  yeh man an with phpchrome its great can log to the debug console
[02:34:25] <Myx0x3> Cork: is it this your talking about? http://i.imgur.com/kf6D9.png
[02:34:26] <aaronmcadam> safari doesn't have the same ui for switching tabs
[02:35:02] <aaronmcadam> Safari also has a different interface for looking at styles when you inspect
[02:35:03] <Cork> Myx0x3: yes, but you need to inspect the specific request
[02:35:10] <Cork> Myx0x3: not sure if safari can do that
[02:35:12] <aaronmcadam> it's showing network info on the right for me
[02:35:17] <Myx0x3> Cork: hmm.. okay..
[02:35:33] <aaronmcadam> you should be able to Myx0x3
[02:35:37] <Myx0x3> Cork: i know there is an addon for firefox (http headers) maybe thats what i need?
[02:35:39] <Cork> Myx0x3: try clicking the request in the list
[02:35:46] <truedon> Can anyone help with my jquery redraw issue?
[02:35:49] <Anticom> howdy
[02:35:50] <Cork> Myx0x3: firebug is a better option
[02:36:03] <Cork> Myx0x3: or you can do it natively now days
[02:36:07] <aaronmcadam> truedon: chrome dev tools can
[02:36:08] <Myx0x3> Cork: i dont like firefox, hehe
[02:36:10] <Cork> (ctrl+shift+k)
[02:36:20] <Anticom> i'm trying to get all events registered to dom elements... http://jsfiddle.net/bpAwU/2/ (according to: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236067/test-if-event-handler-is-bound-to-an-element-in-jquery/1236080#1236080 )
[02:36:24] <aaronmcadam> Myx0x3: can you try chrome instead? its tools are better
[02:36:48] <Anticom> .data('events') is empty although i've registered a working click handler to the div... i don't get why :/
[02:36:59] <dblosevn> aaronmcadam: http://www.freeimagehosting.net/yjs9w
[02:36:59] <aaronmcadam> i thought that was being deprecated
[02:37:02] <Myx0x3> aaronmcadam: yeah, ill give it a try then..
[02:37:24] <Myx0x3> yay, chrome made my OS to freeze :D awesome
[02:37:32] <aaronmcadam> dblosevn: I feel sorry for you using windows
[02:37:35] <Myx0x3> working now tho
[02:37:45] <aaronmcadam> dblosevn: they're different on osx
[02:38:13] <dblosevn> aaronmcadam: eww mac lol although i run lion in a vm so i cant say much
[02:38:31] <dblosevn> just for ios dev though
[02:38:41] <aaronmcadam> I dunno how you can get anything done lol
[02:38:49] <aaronmcadam> unless you're a .net guy?
[02:38:59] <dblosevn> cant get anything done on the mac but video
[02:39:06] <dblosevn> no got out of .net years ago
[02:39:13] <aaronmcadam> what then?
[02:39:19] <dblosevn> none of the tools i use are available on osx
[02:39:20] <Cork> Anticom: .data('events') is removed in newer jquery versions
[02:39:35] <Anticom> Cork :O so what else can i do to get registered events?
[02:39:57] <Cork> Anticom: you can find it through $._data(dom_elm, 'events')
[02:40:14] <Anticom> Cork thank you... i'll give it a shot :>
[02:40:15] <dblosevn> i mainly use linux honestly
[02:40:15] <Cork> Anticom: but remember that this is internal stuff so it might move again in the future
[02:40:18] <aaronmcadam> ah man, don't tell him undocumented methods
[02:40:19] <aaronmcadam> lol
[02:40:24] <greek> Hi fellas. I have a couple of popup menus that are displayed (slideOut) when their titles are clicked. These popup menus in turn contain <select> menu, buttons, etc (in other words, lots of clicking taking place inside these). Now I'd like to be able to click anywhere outside the popup menu to close it. What's the best way to do this? I tried registering a click event on "body" with e.stopPropagation on the popup menu titles like this sugge
[02:40:25] <greek> sts http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2329816/jquery-hide-popup-if-click-detected-elsewhere but when I clicked within my popup menus they were being closed due to a click on the body. Is the only way around this to implement e.stopPropagation on every clickable element inside my popup menus? That would be a serious pain. Is there a more elegant solution? Thanks
[02:40:32] <Cork> Anticom: its not guaranteed to be stable
[02:40:34] <Anticom> Cork just coding an experimental web scraper for phantom js ;)
[02:40:40] <aaronmcadam> dblosevn: good, I trust you now hehe
[02:42:07] <dblosevn> ive got ubuntu,centos, win 7, win 8 on this machine plus a ton of vms, osx, chromeos, android ics
[02:42:32] <Myx0x3> wtf, now Chrome gave me lots of errors that Safari never gave.. wtf is this shit..
[02:42:43] <aaronmcadam> yeh, been learning centos a bit, mainly around package management, yum is a bit mental compared to aptitude
[02:43:25] <dblosevn> i prefer yum over aptitude except apt-get is nice by telling you the packages you need lol
[02:43:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah but it's really annoying having to add an upstream fedora repo
[02:44:04] <dblosevn> :-( I know
[02:44:10] <aaronmcadam> to find new packages like zsh. had real problems finding lib-yaml for example
[02:45:03] <dblosevn> im still learning aptitude, im sure ubuntu will be my new favorite flavor with in the next 6 months or so
[02:45:27] <aaronmcadam> it's much, much easier
[02:45:40] <aaronmcadam> of course, you then have the issue of loads of packages you probably don't need
[02:45:44] <dblosevn> im just still feeling my way around config file locations and stuff
[02:46:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah, same here with cent, luckily they're mostly in /etc too
[02:46:40] <dblosevn> i have to google everything for ubuntu lol
[02:47:13] <dblosevn> hell even changing the resolvers was a pain in the neck
[02:47:17] <Myx0x3> anyone had problems that chrome cant understand jquery plugins?!
[02:47:23] <Myx0x3> just gives me error..
[02:47:24] <dblosevn> took me like half a day to figure that out in ubuntu
[02:47:42] <aaronmcadam> well that's one good thing, there's loads of support for ubuntu
[02:47:56] <dblosevn> chrome understands em fine do you? lol
[02:47:59] <Myx0x3> "Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined "
[02:48:08] <Myx0x3> "})(jQuery);"
[02:48:09] <aaronmcadam> that means you've not included it properly then
[02:48:11] <Myx0x3> dafuq?
[02:48:13] <dblosevn> well you might want to load jquery
[02:48:18] <Myx0x3> well, i am?
[02:48:25] <aaronmcadam> what happens
[02:48:26] <Myx0x3> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[02:48:30] <aaronmcadam> if you open console
[02:48:30] <Myx0x3> i include that
[02:48:36] <aaronmcadam> and type `$.fn`
[02:48:38] <dblosevn> before the code in question?
[02:48:49] <Myx0x3> aha.. insecure fuck
[02:48:53] <Myx0x3> fuck https
[02:49:03] <aaronmcadam> jquery.com doesn't offer a https
[02:49:07] <Myx0x3> i know..
[02:49:08] <aaronmcadam> you need to use google's
[02:49:09] <dblosevn> use googleapis
[02:49:14] <Myx0x3> yeah.. i guess
[02:49:29] <aaronmcadam> I wonder what's happening with that
[02:49:38] <aaronmcadam> I remember there was a blog post somewhere along the line
[02:49:45] <dblosevn> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js
[02:50:07] <Myx0x3> now it works..
[02:50:23] <aaronmcadam> Wish I knew where to file canary bugs easily
[02:50:39] <aaronmcadam> got a very weird problem with mp4 playback they might be interested in
[02:53:49] <Myx0x3> now here is it i think: http://i.imgur.com/380ED.png
[02:54:14] <dblosevn> click on the first request
[02:54:35] <dblosevn> click headers
[02:55:30] <foofoobar> Hi. When I click on a menu item here: http://www.groceries.io/#id-compare (e.g. "Discover Recipes") then it is automatically scrolled to the corresponding div
[02:55:33] <foofoobar> How can I do this?
[02:55:41] <foofoobar> Or how can I debug to find how it is done?
[02:56:33] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: yeah, what do you want? :) "Accept:"?
[02:58:10] <dblosevn> <Cork> (the header X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest)
[02:58:27] <dblosevn> @Myx0x3
[02:59:14] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: im afraid i cant find it :S
[03:00:22] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: http://i.imgur.com/kr7X4.png
[03:02:11] <aaronmcadam> lovely
[03:05:53] <Myx0x3> this is driveing me crazy..
[03:10:28] <aaronmcadam> what is your problem, exactly
[03:15:21] <dblosevn> foofoobar: http://jsfiddle.net/wKUBA/
[03:15:53] <dblosevn> foofoobar: crude example but you get the basic idea
[03:16:13] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: if you dont see that header its a standard request
[03:16:24] <Myx0x3> okay..
[03:17:48] <Myx0x3> then i guess its an standard request, but i dont know how it helps me, lol
[03:18:55] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: does your form have an id?
[03:19:25] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: yes
[03:19:56] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: $('#formid').submit(function() { your div display code; return true; } );
[03:20:14] <Myx0x3> im doing that
[03:20:22] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: in your page load handler eg... $(function () { } );
[03:21:07] <Myx0x3> page load handler?
[03:21:09] <dblosevn> then submit your form, it will do nothing if the listener is not bound either in a dom ready listner or under the form
[03:21:59] <Myx0x3> now you lost me..
[03:24:01] <dblosevn> Myx0x3: http://pastebin.com/r82rNzKn
[03:24:45] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: yeah, i understand that, but not the last part, heh
[03:25:05] <dblosevn> your listener just has to be attached in the dom ready listener
[03:25:25] <dblosevn> if its not the form doesnt exist yet and the listener wotn be attached
[03:26:56] <dblosevn> guess foofoobar didnt care about an answer lol
[03:27:11] <dblosevn> oh well i had fun writing it lmao
[03:27:26] <sunbeam> in a html responsive site i try to create i want the header to display/fill the full width/height of the browser screen
[03:27:29] <sunbeam> when any of the header nav links are clicked the site should reveal the rest of the content
[03:27:42] <sunbeam> or when the user scrolls down
[03:27:48] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this best?
[03:27:52] <dblosevn> sounds annoying lol
[03:29:19] <PBDev> QUESTION: I want to affect the available options in the drop down box, when another dropdown box value is selected.
[03:29:34] <PBDev> so e.g. when I select car make Ford in the drop down box
[03:29:51] <PBDev> under the model drop down box, all the models of that make appear
[03:29:54] <PBDev> any ideas?
[03:30:25] <dblosevn> ya, use ajax and populate the second dropdown
[03:31:50] <dblosevn> PBDev: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12268305/jquery-dynamic-dropdown-menus
[03:32:18] <sunbeam> dblosevn: you think?
[03:32:37] <foofoobar> dblosevn: Mh, not exactly
[03:32:43] <dblosevn> sunbeam: ya id leave probally if i visited a site that did that
[03:32:47] <foofoobar> This is like a simple link to #mydiv
[03:32:52] <foofoobar> but I want a scroll animation
[03:33:00] <dblosevn> well animate the scroll...
[03:33:02] <foofoobar> so the page is scrolled until #mydiv is reached
[03:33:22] <Myx0x3> dblosevn: where is the dom ready listener?
[03:33:27] <xnotte> $("#painelavaliacaoselecionados").on("click", "#tblAvaliacaoSelecionados a.select", function () {            var row = $(this).parents('tr');            alert($(row).find('td.eq(0)').html());            row.remove();         });   my alert returns null, when i have td in position 0 with text

[03:39:26] <Cork> xnotte: put the .eq(0) outside the selector
[03:39:28] <Dr4g> Are there any illegal characters that jquery doesn't parse within data attribute values? I have data-product-title, and when i dump it out from jquery it it's truncated.

[03:42:20] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[03:42:43] <aaronmcadam> how come it gave me men stuff then?
[03:42:48] <foofoobar> dblosevn: Are there also some things I have to consider when using it on body?
[03:42:49] <aaronmcadam> mdn*
[03:42:54] <Cork> donno, but most of the times it doesn't
[03:43:09] <dblosevn> foofoobar: shount matter what your target is
[03:43:24] <dblosevn> *shouldnt
[03:45:51] <foofoobar> dblosevn: because I get an: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[03:46:09] <foofoobar> I changed $t to: var $t = $(this.rel);
[03:46:20] <foofoobar> because my link's href is <a href="#mydiv">
[03:47:50] <foofoobar> Strange, calling $('#howitworks').position().top in the console works
[03:48:00] <foofoobar> so this var $t = $(this.rel); does not work
[03:49:15] <foofoobar> ah, this.rel is empty when I'm linking to an div directly (anchor)
[03:49:40] <ShawnRisk> In this code:Â http://jsfiddle.net/bentonam/a5f44/8/ has three problems. Â If I click the toplink this closes the sublinks and doesn't go to another page. Â Another problem is that if I hover out of the menu items, this doesn't go back to showing the menu items of the page I am on. Â Last, if I click any of the subitems they don't go anywhere on my dev site.
[03:50:48] <dblosevn> foofoobar: are you assigning the rel attrib to your div?
[03:51:14] <foofoobar> ah,, i thought its a shortcut for the href
[03:51:44] <dblosevn> foofoobar: no its telling the code what div you want
[03:52:18] <foofoobar> yes, it works now.. thank you
[03:52:22] <dblosevn> np
[03:54:53] <Hapzz> http://pastebin.com/iCqEJu7h
[03:54:56] <foofoobar> dblosevn: also works without the scrollTop(0) here
[03:55:00] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/hCKrp/1/       how can i make cell1.innerHTML  with style display:none ?
[03:55:01] <Hapzz> the ajax returns "ok", and the .hide wont work
[03:55:02] <Hapzz> any ideas why?
[03:55:14] <Hapzz> (an alert() instead of hide would pop up tho)
[03:55:29] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax101 @ Hapzz
[03:55:30] <bot-t1> Hapzz, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[03:55:45] <aaronmcadam> fundamental misunderstanding
[03:55:52] <Hapzz> aaairc why?
[03:55:54] <dblosevn> foofoobar: are you sure? scrolled right for me the first time but the next time i clicked a link it didnt as well as if the div was scrolled manually it didnt either,
[03:55:56] <Hapzz> the ajax is not the issue..
[03:55:59] <aaronmcadam> yes it is
[03:56:04] <aaronmcadam> you've got the wrong context
[03:56:18] <aaronmcadam> this is not the dom object
[03:56:28] <aaairc> Hapzz:  why what?
[03:56:35] <kaista> Hi just wondering if anyone has had issues passing a £ sign via json? I seem to get a diamond with a ? in it (encoding I'm sure) any ideas how to resolve it?
[03:56:41] <Hapzz> why the image link?
[03:56:46] <foofoobar> dblosevn: Yes I am. I can click how often I want, it works on my page
[03:56:47] <aaronmcadam> kaista: that'll be unicode issue
[03:56:52] <foofoobar> One moment, going to try i in your example
[03:56:58] <kaista> aaronmcadam, any ideas on resolution mate?
[03:57:02] <aaronmcadam> kaista: are you using utf-8?
[03:57:24] <kaista> aaronmcadam, I'm just using fullcalendar so whatever that uses.. most likely not, I normally do but don't have much control over what fullcalendar is doing
[03:57:31] <foofoobar> dblosevn: also in your example it works. Using chrome, maybe this is relevant for you
[03:57:44] <aaronmcadam> kaista: &#163; is a Â£ in unicode html entity
[03:57:52] <foofoobar> dblosevn: What browser are you using?
[03:58:05] <kaista> aaronmcadam, Thanks, I think I've tried that but one min I'll try again
[03:58:05] <Hapzz> kaista the sign you pasted in this channel right now is not in utf-8
[03:58:08] <Cork> aaronmcadam: the ajax isn't the problem in that pb
[03:58:17] <Hapzz> if you copy-pasted that sign, it would remain non-utf-8
[03:58:20] <aaronmcadam> i told him it's the wrong context
[03:58:22] <aaronmcadam> but meh
[03:58:32] <Cork> Hapzz: you need to store the this variable
[03:58:35] <kaista> aaronmcadam, :( no good mate it just displays exactly that..
[03:58:42] <Hapzz> Cork store $(this) in a variable?
[03:58:45] <Cork> Hapzz: this has been overwritten by the ajax call
[03:58:47] <aaronmcadam> exactly the &â€¦ ?
[03:58:49] <Cork> yes
[03:58:56] <kaista> &#163; 123.00
[03:58:57] <Hapzz> okay
[03:59:03] <Hapzz> Cork thanks
[03:59:11] <Cork> Hapzz: each time you create a function it gets a new this variable
[03:59:12] <aaronmcadam> kaista: something like unescape maybe?
[03:59:17] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn unescape

[04:00:13] <foofoobar> Using 22.0.1229.79
[04:00:13] <aaronmcadam> kaista: worth a go
[04:00:28] <dblosevn> foofoobar: thats my version
[04:00:32] <kaista> aaronmcadam, you mean js unescape?
[04:00:43] <kaista> aaronmcadam, I'll try it...
[04:00:52] <aaronmcadam> kaista: yep. ur script must be escaping the values
[04:00:53] <foofoobar> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/wKUBA/4/
[04:01:02] <dblosevn> foofoobar: Version 22.0.1229.94 m
[04:01:30] <foofoobar> I can't image that this slightly version difference does make this difference
[04:01:42] <dblosevn> foofoobar: no completely erratic
[04:02:01] <dblosevn> foofoobar: only right on the first click
[04:02:10] <foofoobar> dblosevn: maybe your computer is on its period
[04:02:23] <kaista> aaronmcadam, unfortunately that don't work I tried to set it in the event render event
[04:02:38] <aaronmcadam> that's weird as
[04:02:44] <dblosevn> foofoobar: lol doubtful my computer is in better shape then me
[04:02:49] <aaronmcadam> what's your encoding?
[04:02:49] <foofoobar> hehe
[04:03:21] <kaista> aaronmcadam, infact I don't think its replacing correctly on emin

[04:03:43] <kaista> aaronmcadam, should I be putting £ in and unescaping or &#163; and unescaping?
[04:04:02] <aaronmcadam> kaista: try the entity
[04:04:04] <dblosevn> foofoobar: almost 1 month ols lol
[04:04:11] <dblosevn> *old
[04:04:15] <foofoobar> dblosevn: nice.. so strange that its not working there
[04:04:29] <aaronmcadam> kaista: try checking your Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8
[04:04:43] <dblosevn> foofoobar: dont work in firefox or ie either trying safari
[04:04:44] <aaronmcadam> in the response header
[04:05:40] <dblosevn> not safari either
[04:05:41] <aaronmcadam> or add a meta tag with it in
[04:05:46] <foofoobar> dblosevn: Works in FF 13.0.1 here
[04:06:15] <kaista> aaronmcadam, content type in my head tag?
[04:06:25] <dblosevn> foofoobar: 16.0.1
[04:06:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah, try adding the meta tag
[04:06:49] <dblosevn> and IE 10
[04:07:02] <aaronmcadam> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
[04:07:39] <dblosevn> I know why hold on

[04:09:01] <foofoobar> dblosevn: okay
[04:09:19] <aaronmcadam> that's weird as fuck
[04:09:20] <kaista> aaronmcadam, I tried this as a quick and dirty check.. $(element).html(unescape(element.html())); in the event render function
[04:09:29] <kaista> wait
[04:09:46] <kaista> nope
[04:09:51] <kaista> wth is going on here
[04:10:03] <aaronmcadam> can u try using jsfiddle
[04:10:15] <kaista> id: 2,

[04:10:16] <kaista> total: 0
[04:10:17] <kaista> },
[04:10:18] <kaista> sorry!
[04:10:28] <aaronmcadam> just try to add the pound sign in a simple bit of js
[04:10:42] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle for code examples
[04:10:52] <kaista> aaronmcadam, this is all handle by fullcalendar.. I just pass it a json array
[04:11:09] <aaronmcadam> if you forget about the calendar for a sec
[04:11:10] <kaista> the only thing I can do to get to the content is use the event render event
[04:11:17] <foofoobar> dblosevn: just figured out that $('body').animateâ€¦ works in chrome but not in firefox. In firefox I had to use $('html,body').animate...
[04:11:57] <kaista> $(".placeholder-165").html("£123"); works fine aaronmcadam
[04:12:13] <aaronmcadam> good stuff
[04:12:28] <aaronmcadam> and you're using utf-8?
[04:12:30] <aga> is there a way to make sure iframe content has been completely loaded?
[04:12:41] <kaista> aaronmcadam, I have used the meta tag you mentioned also yes
[04:12:44] <aaronmcadam> it depends on your userbase
[04:12:52] <aaronmcadam> it should work ok then
[04:12:53] <blackspotwiggins> aga, load event on the iframe
[04:13:02] <kaista> aaronmcadam, it's the json feed itself thats messing it up
[04:13:28] <aaronmcadam> strange
[04:13:30] <kaista> Accept:text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
[04:13:30] <kaista> Accept-Charset:ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
[04:13:33] <aaronmcadam> how are you parsing it?
[04:13:40] <kaista> aaronmcadam, fullcalendar is
[04:13:43] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:13:51] <aaronmcadam> how old is fullcalendar?
[04:13:52] <kaista> if I look at the raw data its messed up before it gets to fullcalendar
[04:13:58] <aga> blackspotwiggins: then how do I access the iframe's content?
[04:14:09] <aaronmcadam> kaista: with the <?>
[04:14:10] <aaronmcadam> ?
[04:14:30] <kaista> what I pasted up there is the raw output of the page
[04:14:43] <smftre> how could I enhance http://sharer.co using jQuery? Any off the bat ideas?
[04:14:44] <kaista> title: "£ ï¿½ 0",
[04:14:48] <aaronmcadam> weird
[04:15:07] <kaista> damn right.
[04:15:21] <kaista> I don't normally come to ask on irc I just lurk/try to help but this one's got me
[04:15:36] <smftre> only acceept UTF8
[04:15:41] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you need to try a different plugin
[04:15:56] <kaista> I need to use fullcalendar, as it's a modification to it providing a view we need
[04:16:11] <blackspotwiggins> aga, what do you mean exactly?
[04:16:12] <kaista> basically stuck with it, and stuck with crappy server side code/framework instead of my usual .net
[04:16:14] <aaronmcadam> no way to hack the parser?
[04:16:27] <aaronmcadam> what are you using?
[04:16:46] <kaista> aaronmcadam, a program called alpha five, not big fan but they use it sometimes at work
[04:16:53] <aaronmcadam> wtf is that
[04:16:55] <kaista> its outputting fine, cept for this weird encoding
[04:17:01] <kaista> aaronmcadam, it's the bane of my life

[04:18:30] <aaronmcadam> that's invalid
[04:18:34] <CathaliN> how can I get the "id" into a variable?
[04:18:37] <aaronmcadam> unless you know
[04:18:52] <nVee> morning! so I want to recreate the wheel and build a very simple image fade in / fade out slider. No buttons, no functionality, purely just find all images in a div, fade in one after the other after a 30 second interval. I have the images in, but now I am not sure where to start :) Can anyone perhaps guide me through a rough idea as to how this will need to work, or perhaps have a resource
[04:18:52] <nVee> where I can follow a tutorial?
[04:19:02] <kaista> smftre, firstly use a light box so yo udont have to goto a view page
[04:19:18] <CathaliN> aaronmcadam: that's a little part of my huge JSON
[04:19:26] <smftre> kaista: but lightboxes dont seo and share so well..
[04:19:35] <aaronmcadam> ?eval JSON.parse( '{ "Children": null, "Name": "777-101", "Type": "Meter", "id": 1179, "idParent": 197 }').id
[04:19:35] <CathaliN> it begins with [{ .. }]
[04:19:39] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: 1179
[04:19:45] <aaronmcadam> CathaliN: ^^^
[04:19:54] <smftre> kaista: so basically if you're on homepage, dont change page if you can help it?
[04:19:55] <kaista> smftre, images done seo full stop, plus if a spider crawls it it wont be using javascript and go to the normal like
[04:19:57] <CathaliN> ok
[04:19:57] <kaista> link
[04:20:04] <CathaliN> that for only one part
[04:20:07] <kaista> done/don't
[04:20:10] <aaronmcadam> CathaliN: or use query's parse
[04:20:13] <aaronmcadam> jq*
[04:20:19] <CathaliN> but I want it for all the id's
[04:20:20] <smftre> ok
[04:20:26] <aaronmcadam> each em
[04:20:36] <aaronmcadam> parse will return an array
[04:20:48] <aaronmcadam> loop or $.each
[04:21:02] <blackspotwiggins> aga, $(this).content()
[04:21:32] <aga> contents() ?
[04:21:32] <dblosevn> foofoobar: got it
[04:21:36] <smftre> kaista: other than that? ok?

[04:22:06] <blackspotwiggins> yeah sry
[04:22:14] <sunbeam> is it possible to check when the user scrolls a site?
[04:22:17] <sunbeam> scrolls down?
[04:22:19] <dblosevn> foofoobar: me === tired, only explaination
[04:22:22] <sunbeam> like "on scroll down"
[04:22:40] <foofoobar> sunbeam: yes, there is an event called scroll
[04:22:54] <foofoobar> sunbeam: http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[04:23:12] <dblosevn> foofoobar: you check that out, that does exactly what its supossed to
[04:23:54] <foofoobar> Yes, it works here (as well as the other example before). The difference is the += I guess?
[04:24:21] <foofoobar> What is with $('body,html').animate({scrollTop : $t.offset().top},'slow'); ? This also works great here. Does that work for you ?
[04:24:23] <dblosevn> no, in the old example clcik the same link rwice
[04:24:26] <dblosevn> *twice
[04:24:31] <foofoobar> one moment
[04:25:16] <foofoobar> I have no problem clicking the same link twice here
[04:25:27] <dblosevn> it scrolls to the topo f the div
[04:25:44] <foofoobar> ahh, yes
[04:25:50] <foofoobar> but try the offset() method
[04:25:54] <dblosevn> the new one doesnt
[04:25:56] <foofoobar> this works also with clicking twice
[04:26:04] <foofoobar> .animate({scrollTop : $t.offset().top},'slow');
[04:26:05] <dblosevn> offset returns the same as position in this case
[04:26:26] <dblosevn> ya that works too as i said tired
[04:26:28] <dblosevn> lol
[04:26:35] <foofoobar> No problem, thank me for your help!
[04:26:45] <dblosevn> your welcome?
[04:26:53] <dblosevn> lmao
[04:27:20] <dblosevn> i know what you were sayin just messin with you
[04:27:42] <foofoobar> err
[04:27:48] <foofoobar> Thank you for your help, sorry :D
[04:28:02] <dblosevn> np
[04:28:54] <dblosevn> might want to cancel the previous animation acts really screwed up if you spam click a link while its scrolling
[04:29:12] <aga> blackspotwiggins: what if the iframe loads a page that has javascript inside of it that generates some output to a div? How do I get the contents of that DIV then?
[04:29:46] <kaista> aaronmcadam, have some further information.. if I try to replace a token say --pound-- $(element).html($(element).html().replace(/--pound--/g,"£")); it still fails!
[04:30:11] <aaronmcadam> that is messed up!
[04:30:16] <kaista> yes, yes it is
[04:30:47] <aaronmcadam> sorry dude, I've gotta get some work done. I might be about later tho
[04:31:00] <kaista> k thanks anyway
[04:32:14] <blackspotwiggins> aga, load fires then all the assets inside the frame are loaded
[04:32:33] <blackspotwiggins> if the additional content appears after that, you need to get creative

[04:44:03] <sunbeam> so also -webkit-background-size: etc
[04:45:32] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: your e.preventdefault is stopping the click from following the url
[04:45:55] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: okay if I remove that all the problems will go away?
[04:46:05] <seutje> ShawnRisk: split on e.type
[04:46:07] <dblosevn> probally not lol
[04:46:23] <seutje> actually, why are you preventing the default action?
[04:46:32] <dblosevn> i see no reason myself
[04:46:43] <seutje> kinda awkward to have it on both mouseenter and click
[04:46:48] <ShawnRisk> I am not sure was checking to see if that was needed
[04:46:58] <dblosevn> nope :-)
[04:47:17] <seutje> ShawnRisk: what exactly is this supposed to do?
[04:47:23] <dblosevn> nor do i understand why your binding to click
[04:47:24] <xnotte> seutje: i've done this $("table.tblAvaliacaoSelecionados tr:visible td:first-child").css('display', 'none'); and doesnt work
[04:47:33] <dblosevn> mouseenter is plenty
[04:47:39] <dblosevn> click just hides it
[04:48:12] <seutje> xnotte: why don't u just put that in the css?
[04:48:33] <dblosevn> maybe he wants to animate it so it doesnt go away so fast?
[04:48:36] <seutje> xnotte: I'm guessing this TD isn't there when this line is run?
[04:48:57] <xnotte> because it's created dynamicly. I've asked before:
[04:49:03] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/hCKrp/1/       how can i make cell1.innerHTML  with style display:none ?
[04:49:13] <seutje> oh
[04:49:18] <seutje> cell.style.display = 'none';
[04:49:32] <seutje> cell1.style.display = 'none'; *
[04:49:45] <seutje> or wait, u wanna hide the cell or the contents?
[04:50:02] <sunbeam> how can i reset all background properties for html{} apart from background-image ?
[04:50:05] <sunbeam> so also -webkit-background-size: etc
[04:50:22] <ShawnRisk> seutje: it is suppose to show the sublinks on hover of toplinks.  It is suppose to show the sublinks of the page I am on if I load that page, and hover out.  It is suppose to be clickable the toplinks and the sublinks.  Does that make sense?
[04:50:40] <xnotte> seutje: it worked, many thanks!
[04:50:57] <seutje> ShawnRisk: sure
[04:52:17] <ShawnRisk> I just would like code that would make this work, and I read everything that has been said but is all I have to do is take out e.preventdefault and click?
[04:54:05] <seutje> ShawnRisk: how do I determine "the page I am on"?
[04:55:05] <ShawnRisk> seutje: this is the code I started out with: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/5/  that is how I originally determined this.
[05:00:05] <ShawnRisk> I have to go in a 10 mins max.
[05:01:07] <seutje> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/9/
[05:01:15] <seutje> could use some optimization, but seems to work
[05:01:29] <seutje> ShawnRisk: used the info link as the "active" one
[05:01:47] <seutje> ShawnRisk: does it also need to be open when one of the links in that sublink is the active?
[05:02:36] <ShawnRisk> seutje: if I click the toplink or sublink for any section, the toplink should be highlighted and the sublinks show up.
[05:02:55] <seutje> ShawnRisk: so it shouldn't just go to that link?
[05:03:29] <ShawnRisk> seutje: what I said above is after I have click on the link and the page has loaded.
[05:03:41] <seutje> oh ok
[05:04:22] <ShawnRisk> seutje: One problem I see with your jsfiddle is that if I try to hover over the sublinks I can't.
[05:07:06] <MacroMan> If I have a click defined on a class selector, what would be the best way to get the occurance number for that element? eg, alert('Clicked on the 'n' occurance of myclass');
[05:07:20] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I have to go in 3 mins max
[05:08:30] <seutje> bye
[05:11:03] <seutje> ShawnRisk: btw, adding a margin-top of -1px to the ULs fixes that mouseleave problem
[05:11:06] <ShawnRisk> seutje: thank you for the help, I will talk to you later
[05:11:17] <ShawnRisk> thanks I will do that
[05:24:08] <austriancoder> hi all...
[05:25:39] <austriancoder> I need to create a fixed size layout and want to use jquery ui - the good thing is that I need only to support vga and qvga - so a simple downscale should work. Whats the best way to do it? Does jquery ui use em's ?
[05:28:09] <seutje> bot-t1: tell shawnrisk actually, scratch that negative margin-top nonsense, just change the top from 40px to 38px, as the top links are only 38px high. Also, the thingy to determine the active one is sorta weird here, could prolly use some sort of refactoring but my DB import is done now so I gtg back to work :P http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/10/
[05:28:10] <bot-t1> seutje, Okay.
[05:32:17] <matzeso> hey guys.. hopefully someone can help me here. I have a <ul><li> list with each containing a picture and 2 links.. one link is deleting the picture from the server/database with synchronized ajax, on success I hide the element.. but the other list elements remain on their position, but I want them in order again, without a hole
[05:32:48] <matzeso> can I rearrange the list without refreshing the page?
[05:38:08] <matzeso> ok.. I was stupid.. nevermind.. I did the hide() on a table inside the list element, not on the list itself..
[05:45:49] <HarryPitfall> Is possible to use the new 'menu' widget of jquery.ui as context menu?
[05:46:01] <HarryPitfall> any hint about how to do it?
[06:01:28] <seutje> HarryPitfall: simplest implementation I can think of: http://jsfiddle.net/78RwV/
[06:06:14] <seutje> HarryPitfall: with close-on-click-somewhere-outside-the-menu -> http://jsfiddle.net/78RwV/2/
[06:07:20] <HarryPitfall> tks very much
[06:07:55] <HarryPitfall> works nicely
[06:08:17] <HarryPitfall> I'm upgrading flexigrid to enable lots of things
[06:08:30] <HarryPitfall> currently, I already made it keyboard friendly
[06:13:29] <SkiOne> hi I am dynamically adding a div with a drop down inside it, I need to get the id of the div when I change the drop down, I put this inside a change event but I keep getting an empty var: var nearest_id = $(this).closest('div[id]');
[06:15:29] <iaj> Anyone can guide me to a nice animate() effect to have something like its flying to the center of the page?
[06:16:22] <iaj> Actually I got started with position:absolute; on my div and attaching top: and right: accordingly to end up in the middle of the page.. is that the way to go?
[06:17:34] <onr> that or position:fixed
[06:18:30] <onr> you'll try different easing options and try jq easing plugin, http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[06:21:27] <DukeDrake> hi
[06:22:27] <onr> hi
[06:22:29] <Dirkos> What is the best way to replace [title] in a jquery node?
[06:22:41] <iaj> onr: i can use easing.js to generate a 'fly in' effect?
[06:22:47] <Dirkos> im working with some kind of template in DOM which i load and need to replace
[06:22:56] <Dirkos> but while loading it, its not an object so the JS replace wont work
[06:23:06] <onr> document.title: 'new title here'
[06:23:17] <onr> oops, = instead of colon
[06:24:22] <onr> iaj: i can't think of any 'fly in' effect now, just try different easing options
[06:24:25] <DukeDrake> I have two submit buttons in a form. How can I differ, which one was clicked to submit the form?
[06:25:16] <onr> DukeDrake: store state in variable if its clicked or not
[06:26:14] <DukeDrake> there must be a way to check which click triggered the submit .. ?
[06:26:38] <iaj> onr: heh.. ok thank yous :)
[06:26:52] <onr> np
[06:28:35] <DukeDrake> ok, I changed one submit to a button ...
[06:34:20] <onr> you can stop submit button to take effect before checking, DukeDrake
[06:36:05] <PBDev> QUESTION: I want to affect the available options in the drop down box, when another dropdown box value is selected.
[06:36:07] <PBDev> so e.g. when I select car make Ford in the drop down box
[06:36:13] <PBDev> under the model drop down box, all the models of that make appear
[06:36:18] <PBDev> any ideas?
[06:36:44] <anli> Is there a way to get ellipsis on a multi line span with text-overflow: ellipsis ?
[06:37:48] <DukeDrake> heh
[06:38:20] <DukeDrake> anli: maybe css clip is what you're looking for
[06:38:51] <DukeDrake> although ... no ... clip only is valid for rectangular shapes
[06:39:21] <anli> I only use those
[06:39:29] <fhd> I want to use Function.bind() on a jQuery function, like this: $(document.body).append.bind(undefined, element); Doesn't seem to work though, ideas?
[06:43:54] <PBDev> how o i declare a json file?
[06:44:17] <PBDev> is it like script type="text/javascript". What is it. What should the file type be?
[06:44:37] <fghj> fhd: what are you trying to do? bind works for events, like mouse or keyboard events, and anyway you should use on()
[06:44:40] <fghj> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[06:45:00] <fhd> fghj: I want to use ECMAScript 5's Function.bind(), which is something entirely different.
[06:45:09] <fhd> fghj: Doesn't seem to have a jQuery counterpart :(
[06:45:12] <fghj> pbdev, the MIME type is application/json http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816
[06:45:29] <fgro> jquery noob q: i have a structure <div><span></span></div> ... how can i remove the div but keep the span?
[06:46:06] <PBDev> and the saved file type?
[06:46:21] <PBDev> can that end with json. Dreamweaver is showing me error.
[06:47:38] <fghj> sorry fhd, I'm new to JS, did not know there's an ecmascript bind()
[06:48:14] <fhd> fghj: I got really addicted to it :)
[06:48:47] <usc911> Hey guys, I have a site that pulls in news feeds from database. I want to have it to that the title is displayed and a 'read more' that will expand the news post and make the content viewable. My question is how do I set it so that just one article drops down? all of the tutorials I have found and used will expand all the posts as they have the same id. Anyone point me in the right direction/have a demo of this? cheers
[06:51:37] <dgx> hey all, when creating jqueryui dialog i have inside a <p> with id=close text, but when i do a function it is not clickable at all
[06:51:51] <dgx> the <p> is there, with styles and all, i just can't close the dialog
[06:52:06] <dgx> also, im loading it with ajax via  .load()
[06:54:44] <usc911> Hey guys, I have a site that pulls in news feeds from database.

[06:55:56] <clocKwize> usc911, first off, ids are meant to be unique.
[06:56:08] <clocKwize> you have invalid html
[06:57:51] <HarryPitfall> seutje: tks for the help, I made a jQuery plugin for the context menu: http://pastebin.com/nG9nUjHk
[06:58:04] <HarryPitfall> Your code points me to correct direction
[07:00:24] <Myx0x3> why does this not work? :( $(this).children().children().first().text($(this).text() == '+' ? '-' : '+') (the element contains an +)
[07:01:54] <seutje> HarryPitfall: kewl, not sure if my solution was very cross-browser though :x
[07:02:30] <HarryPitfall> will be needed only on ff and chrome
[07:02:36] <Peanut__> Hello. I'm having a problem with removing images. I try to remove them with .remove or .empty which works. What does not work is having them unload from memory.
[07:02:37] <HarryPitfall> mostly on chrome
[07:02:40] <seutje> Myx0x3: $(this).text() also return the text of the children
[07:02:47] <seutje> HarryPitfall: oh, then ur prolly golden :)
[07:03:16] <onr> Peanut__: memory?
[07:03:18] <Myx0x3> seutje: oh
[07:03:22] <Peanut__> And since I display roughly 3 new images each 5 seconds this is terrible for my memory.
[07:03:25] <Peanut__> Ram?
[07:03:41] <seutje> Peanut__: not sure if u can force that
[07:04:12] <Peanut__> So using .remove on the div the image is in is the correct way to remove it?
[07:04:20] <Myx0x3> seutje: how should i make it then?
[07:05:12] <SkiOne> hi I am dynamically adding a div with a drop down inside it, I need to get the id of the div when I change the drop down, I put this inside a change event but I keep getting an empty var: var nearest_id = $(this).closest('div[id]');
[07:05:18] <seutje> Peanut__: iirc, yea, when's there's no more reference to an image, it should be garbage collected
[07:05:51] <UltraMC> Hi, why when mouseenter .swichClass aint firing http://jsfiddle.net/QHUWu/4
[07:05:56] <Peanut__> What if the image is in a div that is inside two other divs. And I .remove the top most div?
[07:06:42] <seutje> Myx0x3: $(this).contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).text() instead of $(this).text()
[07:06:56] <seutje> Myx0x3: might be a better way to select only the textnode though
[07:07:08] <UltraMC> kk had no jquery-ui attached
[07:07:29] <seutje> Myx0x3: might have to slap a .first() in there also
[07:07:37] <UltraMC> Why swiching class is not "easeInOutQuad" (animated) here http://jsfiddle.net/QHUWu/5/ ?
[07:10:23] <seutje> Myx0x3: this the use-case ur looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/qdT27/
[07:11:28] <Myx0x3> seutje: naah, its an toggle, and + and - is the "indicator"
[07:11:37] <Myx0x3> that its been fold out
[07:11:45] <seutje> wait, my example isn't even working properly lol
[07:13:45] <hyper_ch> hi there, I wonder if there is some trick/way to make a table and make it sortable with the DataTables library but split the table up into two columns (but they sortable as a whole)
[07:14:57] <sunbeam> how can i reset all background properties for html{} apart from background-image ?
[07:15:03] <sunbeam> so also -webkit-background-size: etc
[07:16:40] <seutje> Myx0x3: hm, yeah, whitespace matters when dealing with textnodes
[07:16:57] <syskk> is there any library out there that would provide me with Facebook style tagging in inputs?
[07:17:19] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/qdT27/1/ seems to work properly though
[07:18:24] <Myx0x3> seutje: its not how i want it :(
[07:18:38] <Myx0x3> im trying to build an example
[07:18:57] <UltraMC> Why swiching class is not "easeInOutQuad" (animated) here http://jsfiddle.net/QHUWu/6
[07:19:23] <seutje> Myx0x3: oooh, u wanted the second "this" to reference the child you've traversed down to?
[07:20:08] <nuken> hi all
[07:20:10] <Myx0x3> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/xu8yN/1/
[07:20:14] <Myx0x3> there!
[07:20:17] <UltraMC> Hi nauken
[07:20:54] <nuken> anyone have any example howto made a simple please wait .... when a script is executing
[07:21:38] <Myx0x3> seutje: thing is, it always "return" +
[07:21:56] <chee> sunbeam: with jQuery? was the style added with jQuery too?
[07:22:03] <chee> if so then i think...
[07:22:45] <chee> var bg = $( "html" ).css( "background" ); $( "html" ).removeAttr( "style" ).css( "background", bg );
[07:22:47] <seutje> UltraMC: you sure this support animating gradients?
[07:22:51] <chee> sunbeam: ^
[07:23:16] <UltraMC> seutje, why not? Class is a class, why it makes a difference is it with gradient or not
[07:23:44] <seutje> UltraMC: because animating a gradient is infinitely more complex?
[07:23:53] <seutje> UltraMC: works fine with just BG color
[07:24:15] <UltraMC> :(
[07:24:19] <lalalalala> Hi
[07:25:19] <lalalalala> I'm adding an element on the page via a line of code similar with this one: $("#div-container").append($(content));
[07:25:23] <seutje> UltraMC: straight from the documentation: "Not all styles can be animated. For example, there is no way to animate a background image. Any styles that cannot be animated will be changed at the end of the animation."
[07:25:36] <lalalalala> where content contains the html elements to be added
[07:25:41] <UltraMC> ouch
[07:25:52] <Myx0x3> seutje: do you understand what i try to do? :P
[07:26:38] <lalalalala> on the other hand, I have a listner with this line of code: $("#id-div-inserted").change()
[07:26:47] <lalalalala> but on change, nothing happens
[07:26:55] <lalalalala> any ideas?
[07:27:12] <trari> is there a way to get the element a snap-element is snapped to? i tried to map it but it returns all values it could possibly snap to
[07:27:35] <seutje> Myx0x3: hang on
[07:27:42] <seutje> HOLY FUCK ONCLICK
[07:27:54] <Myx0x3> seutje: hehe
[07:28:50] <seutje> Myx0x3: within that context, "this" will always reference the h3
[07:29:17] <seutje> Myx0x3: the text method allows you to pass a function though, which re-scopes "this" to the element(s) you called text() on
[07:29:37] <Myx0x3> seutje: so i have to add "$(this).children().children().first()" instead of $(this)?
[07:29:56] <seutje> Myx0x3: so without fixing the onclick attribute nastiness: http://jsfiddle.net/xu8yN/3/
[07:30:29] <Myx0x3> seutje: oh, because this code works in another place
[07:30:30] <seutje> Myx0x3: no, instead of .text($(this).text()) you have to use .text(function() { return $(this).text(); });
[07:30:48] <Myx0x3> seutje: no it uses $(this) properly sorry
[07:30:56] <Myx0x3> ooh, i see..
[07:31:02] <smftre> Has anyone used jQuery Mobile?
[07:31:15] <seutje> so instead of passing .text() a string, you're passing it a function to be evaluated within that context
[07:31:31] <seutje> within that function, 'this' references the (new) context
[07:31:37] <seutje> k, I suck at explaining JS scoping :(
[07:31:40] <Myx0x3> oh okay
[07:31:46] <Myx0x3> i think i understand
[07:31:48] <Myx0x3> hehe
[07:32:39] <lalalalala> any ideas on my question too?
[07:33:04] <smftre> Yes no maybe?
[07:34:19] <lalalalala> smftre: what's your question again?
[07:34:31] <smftre> Anyone used jQuery Mobile?
[07:35:23] <seutje> Myx0x3: now, with 100% less onclick! http://jsfiddle.net/xu8yN/5/
[07:35:25] <seutje> :D
[07:35:27] <lalalalala> from all the peoples here, probably someone did
[07:35:36] <lalalalala> but that's not a valid question
[07:35:51] <lalalalala> ask about your problem
[07:35:56] <smftre> I have to add jQueryMobile to an already made CRM, so when a user is viewing it on their mobile device then it shows that version, how do I go about doing all this? anyone had a similar experience?
[07:36:19] <Myx0x3> seutje: problem is, i dont want every  h3 clickable ;) but i know i have to fix, but ill do it later, it does not kill anyone ;)
[07:36:35] <lalalalala> smftre: what does it have to do with jQuery?
[07:36:42] <smftre> well, it's jQuery isnt it?
[07:36:59] <lalalalala> there are plenty of ways to do that
[07:37:03] <seutje> Myx0x3: use a class and target h3.thatClass then :)
[07:37:12] <smftre> do I just go line for line and replace with jQueryMobile elements or what?
[07:37:17] <seutje> Myx0x3: it's just that... onclick makes baby Resig cry
[07:37:30] <lalalalala> I don't think that's a very good idea
[07:37:32] <Myx0x3> seutje: hehe i know
[07:37:41] <smftre> well?
[07:37:43] <smftre> what is
[07:37:53] <lalalalala> you said you need to load the jQuery mobile in case you have to deal with mobile terminals?
[07:38:00] <smftre> correct
[07:38:08] <lalalalala> ok
[07:38:39] <smftre> but it's an already made application/site, so needs to still function as is, just with a lovely new display
[07:38:53] <smftre> not sure how to start undertaking this all!?!?
[07:39:32] <lalalalala> I dont't know if I fully understand your question
[07:39:47] <lalalalala> but, for the conditional loading of a javascript file
[07:40:10] <lalalalala> you have to detect the terminal first (since the condition is related to the terminal)
[07:40:11] <smftre> Do I have to go element for element in the whole application/site and replace each one with the jQueryMobile element equivalent?
[07:40:30] <smftre> yes, say I've already done that, then it redirects to the "mobile version"
[07:40:57] <smftre> now this mobile version, do I just take the desktop version and replace element for element with the jQueryMobile version?
[07:42:08] <lalalalala> so if(blablabla browser == ie_sucks) { include("jquery_mobile.js")}
[07:42:27] <lalalalala> another way is to detect it on the server side
[07:42:42] <Nancy2012> i have a little problem on my if statement where i am calling another function named confirmSubmit()â€¦ but it seems doesn't work
[07:42:44] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/88N66/
[07:42:48] <lalalalala> and there to conditionaly load the javascript you need
[07:43:30] <smftre> i've already done that, I know what device the user is connected with, but I dont know how to add the actual jQueryMobile stuff, or rather, how to add it to an already existing application/site
[07:43:51] <smftre> as it does nothing if just included
[07:44:11] <smftre> do you have to rebuild the frontend again using jQueryMobile?
[07:44:22] <smftre> ^ perhaps that's a better way of asking the question.
[07:44:33] <lalalalala> :)
[07:44:40] <lalalalala> smftre: what is jquery?
[07:45:05] <smftre> so you're saying "yes, I have to rebuild" ?
[07:45:37] <lalalalala> nancy2012: what is your question 'cause I don't understand anything
[07:45:47] <lalalalala> smftre: probably
[07:45:55] <smftre> god..
[07:45:59] <lalalalala> smftre: how should I know what you have to do
[07:46:03] <Nancy2012> if you take a look on this function â€¦  confirmSubmit(id);
[07:46:14] <Nancy2012> which is inside the success:
[07:46:14] <Nancy2012> Ã§
[07:46:23] <smftre> lalalalala: because my question was simple, do you have to rebuild a web app when adding jQueryMobile.
[07:46:36] <Nancy2012> just need to know how can i make it work â€¦
[07:46:37] <lalalalala> jquery/jQueryMobile are libraries of javascript
[07:47:09] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I am back, and I tried your margin-top: âˆ’1px on #topnav ul and #topnav ul li ul and #topnav ul li ul.active but none of that helped me fix the problem.  Any further ideas?
[07:47:09] <bot-t1> (2 hours 18 mins ago) <seutje> tell shawnrisk actually, scratch that negative margin-top nonsense, just change the top from 40px to 38px, as the top links are only 38px high. Also, the thingy to determine the active one is sorta weird here, could prolly use some sort of refactoring but my DB import is done now so I gtg back to work :P http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/10/
[07:47:15] <Nancy2012> can you see...
[07:47:17] <Nancy2012> success: function(response) {if(response == 1){alert('You cant able delete due to it uses in accommodation section.');}else{confirmSubmit(id);}},
[07:47:23] <Nancy2012> in the else â€¦.
[07:47:23] <Nancy2012> there
[07:47:35] <Nancy2012> there is confirmSubmit() function
[07:47:57] <lalalalala> they differ in content and in some cases (probably, I'm not a specialist) in the way they do things
[07:48:05] <seutje> ShawnRisk: problem was a 2px gat between the trigger and the list :)
[07:48:19] <seutje> since u set top to 40px but the trigger was only 38px in height
[07:48:44] <lalalalala> you might need to rewrite the front end in case you will use functions that don't exist in jQueryMobile, this being a smaller version of jQuery
[07:48:51] <lalalalala> so the answer remains probably
[07:49:36] <lalalalala> Nancy2012: does the code gets there?
[07:49:44] <lalalalala> Nancy2012: did you checked?
[07:49:52] <Nancy2012> nope.. it doesn't work
[07:50:14] <lalalalala> it doesn't get there?
[07:50:38] <Xtreme> hey guys
[07:50:49] <Xtreme> i am creating a chatroom
[07:50:54] <Xtreme> and i am having scroll problem
[07:51:15] <Xtreme> whenever a new message appears, i want it to scroll to the bottom
[07:51:18] <Nancy2012> only problem is thatâ€¦ i have a function inside the success: of ajax api
[07:51:45] <Xtreme> anyone knows how can i solve it?
[07:52:16] <lalalalala> Nancy2012: that's not a problem
[07:52:31] <lalalalala> Nancy2012: you can have functions there
[07:52:32] <Nancy2012> i changed something..
[07:52:33] <Nancy2012> a
[07:52:47] <Xtreme> anyone?
[07:53:11] <lalalalala> Nancy2012: the problem might be: 1. you don't get there, 2. the functions don't exists
[07:53:16] <lalalalala> Xtreme
[07:53:19] <Nancy2012> and now it saysâ€¦ data is not definedâ€¦  which is already defined on the data: {id:id}
[07:53:36] <Xtreme> lalalalala, sorry had a DC
[07:53:36] <Nancy2012> actuallyâ€¦ i am going something like thisâ€¦ confirmSubmit(data)
[07:53:47] <Xtreme> lalalalala, do you know how can i solve my problem
[07:55:27] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I have changed this from top: 40px to top: 38px but still is not working.  I am not sure how to make this work from what you are saying.
[07:56:21] <lalalalala> did you tryed $("#element-containing-scroll-bar").animate({scrollDown: $("#element-containing-scroll-bar").height})
[07:56:22] <lalalalala> ?
[07:56:52] <Xtreme> lalalalala, i am new :) try it
[07:57:13] <ShawnRisk> seutje: if this is totally a css question, I can ask in that room.
[07:57:59] <Xtreme> lalalalala, doesnt work ;(
[07:58:03] <seutje> ShawnRisk: odd, the example I pasted worked for me
[07:58:49] <ShawnRisk> seutje: you are looking at #9 and you can hover over the sublinks?
[07:59:23] <seutje> ShawnRisk: nope, 10
[07:59:41] <Xtreme> lalalalala, any other solution?
[07:59:50] <seutje> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/10/
[07:59:54] <seutje> made the "cat" link active
[08:00:57] <ShawnRisk> looking
[08:01:26] <lalalalala> Xtreme: thinking of one
[08:01:37] <Dirkos> why wont the src be updated? http://jsfiddle.net/PXdbv/4/
[08:01:43] <lalalalala> Xtreme: can you paste some code though?
[08:02:55] <Dirkos> anyone with an idea?
[08:03:05] <Dirkos> i load a template part of html and want to update the SRC in it
[08:04:30] <lalalalala> Dirkos: where do you call that function?
[08:05:21] <Dirkos> when the page is loaded and the data is loaded from youtube
[08:06:40] <Dirkos> find looks in the html block right?
[08:06:44] <Dirkos> or is it searching DOM again?
[08:07:52] <lalalalala> to be honest I don't know why you're doing like that
[08:07:56] <lalalalala> but the code is correct
[08:08:10] <Dirkos> well, its loaded dynamicly since it has to be a feed of news/youtube/picture items
[08:08:24] <Dirkos> its ordered with JS since youtube is an external feed
[08:08:26] <lalalalala> why don't you do it like this: $("#iframeyoutube").attr('src', 'test')
[08:08:36] <Xtreme> lalalalala, one min
[08:08:37] <Dirkos> well i work with a template
[08:08:42] <Dirkos> can be 2 youtube movies aswell
[08:08:53] <Dirkos> so thats why im loading the HTML first (tpl_youtubE)
[08:08:59] <lalalalala> ohhh
[08:09:00] <lalalalala> ok
[08:09:54] <Dirkos> but the stupid thing is, there wont be a src haha
[08:10:03] <Xtreme> http://codepad.org/kRKFbnUa
[08:10:08] <Xtreme> lalalalala, ^^
[08:12:20] <ShawnRisk> seutje: in the new code there are three problems.  If I hover out, the sublinks disappear which they should show the sublinks of the current page.  Another problem is that if I click on sublink the sublinks don't show up when the page loads.  The last problem is that the toplinks are not highlighted at all to say that is the section it is on.
[08:12:46] <Xtreme> lalalalala, ?
[08:14:03] <lalalalala> sorry
[08:14:06] <lalalalala> I have to run
[08:14:08] <lalalalala> bye
[08:16:25] <ShawnRisk> seutje: if you want to stop that is okay
[08:16:31] <seutje> ShawnRisk: I don't have the hoverout issue, it just goes back to the active one
[08:16:37] <seutje> ShawnRisk: I didn't actually make links work
[08:19:06] <seutje> ShawnRisk: the highlighting thing is because they are only highlighted by CSS :hover
[08:19:25] <seutje> if you add .active to that and add logic to add/remove that class, should be golden
[08:19:29] <seutje> anyway, I gotta erun!
[08:19:44] <ShawnRisk> seutje: on hoverout of the menu the sublinks show up for the active section?

[08:57:34] <Sir_J> hi guys
[08:57:40] <ShawnRisk> hi
[08:57:41] <Sir_J> is it possible to do this http://jsfiddle.net/mCeAQ/ ?
[09:01:27] <astropirate> Sir_J, Its not a good idea to mess with the prorotypes of built in Objects
[09:01:32] <astropirate> it will make your life miserable
[09:01:42] <astropirate> its good to avoid it :)
[09:01:56] <Sir_J> I see, the question is if it possible
[09:02:10] <Sir_J> I know how to do this [1,2 3, 4].a().b()
[09:02:25] <astropirate> no
[09:02:25] <Sir_J> but don't understand how to do with namespace like [1,2,3].a.b()
[09:02:48] <astropirate> the "this" will refer to the array object
[09:02:56] <astropirate> you can use jquery's  each() method
[09:03:09] <astropirate> or javascripts forEach()
[09:03:24] <astropirate> myArray.forEach(function(elem) {  do stuff with this element})
[09:04:07] <Sir_J> astropirate: is it possible to do this without jquery ?
[09:04:10] <Sir_J> pure javascript ?
[09:04:18] <astropirate> yes, the second code i posted
[09:04:24] <astropirate> using forEach()
[09:04:34] <Sir_J> hmm, okay
[09:05:19] <Sir_J> is any way to preserve context while using namespace  like [1,2,3].a.b() // <-- a is namespace, b is function here

Last problem, the toplink highlighted stays all the time, when if I hover over other toplinks the highlight shou

[09:21:48] <Otineb> hi everyone. I have an email validation script that prevents users from clicking submit before fixing the email format. true to its reputation, IE is the only browser it doesn't work on. (IE allows the form to submit with the incorrectly formatted email) Is there some caveat code I need to add to get IE to behave the same way? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/gLBDz/19/
[09:21:56] <ShawnRisk> seems like everyone is out to lunch
[09:22:19] <Otineb> hey ShawnRisk, I looked at your jsfiddle. I'm not query pro, but can't you do that in pure CSS?
[09:23:52] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: others have told me that, but I want to try with the current code I have if possible.  I am not 100% sure I can do this with pure css as it is strange but want to try with jQuery until I am died
[09:24:31] <Otineb> @ShawnRisk here's a live example you can dissect http://www.pmob.co.uk/temp/dropdown_horizontal2.htm
[09:24:58] <Otineb> I really think it's simpler to use a CSS-only solution, you'll have less issues
[09:25:41] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: I know but issues are issues are issues :D
[09:26:32] <Otineb> @ShawnRisk , well I'm not jQuery expert but I could help with the css only solution
[09:27:00] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: if you can make the jsfiddle work only css go ahead
[09:29:39] <Otineb> @ShawnRisk http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/a5f44/15/ here you go. Just update hex color values and you're done.
[09:31:10] <freeed> Hey guys.. quick questionâ€¦ If I do $('<div></div>').appendTo('.foo').parent() I should be at .foo correct? And able to apply styling to .foo by chaining on a .css() call ?
[09:31:26] <ajpiano> incorrect
[09:31:33] <ajpiano> your set will have the div(s) you just created
[09:32:26] <freeed> ajpiano, k - that's where I'm messing up. After the .appendTo() where in the dom am I? I assumed I was still at the div and .parent() would take me up to .foo
[09:32:36] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: did you see the jsfiddle I had?  It wasn't a dropdown but the sublinks were left to right
[09:32:45] <ajpiano> that assumption seems correct
[09:33:00] <ajpiano> OH i misread the parent, my bad
[09:33:04] <ajpiano> sorry freeed
[09:33:30] <anli> I have a problem with a div not getting a clickable cursor, I use cursor:pointer on http://62.168.145.82:8080/ is the LOGGA IN text that is in line with the other menu entries
[09:33:34] <anli> Is anyone having an idea?
[09:33:46] <freeed> ajpiano, so is that first statement correct? $('<div></div>').appendTo('.foo').parent().css('color', 'red')   would that append a div to .foo and change the color of .foo?
[09:33:55] <anli> I have watched this in firebug in an hour now
[09:34:02] <ajpiano> it should
[09:34:16] <freeed> mmm. ok. thanks .. must be messing up somewhere else
[09:34:16] <anli> Is it about z-index or position: absolute?
[09:40:01] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: any thoughts?
[09:41:56] <ShawnRisk> bentonam: if you get this please let me know
[09:42:07] <freeed> hey guys, if I do $('.foo').find('.bar').remove() does jquery send me back to .foo after the remove? Not sure what to call that current position in the dom..
[09:43:02] <ajpiano> it gives you the set of bars that were removed
[09:43:53] <ShawnRisk> hi ajpiano
[09:43:56] <freeed> ajpiano, so would .remove().parent() point me back to .foo?
[09:44:09] <ajpiano> no, because elements that aren't in the dom anymore don't have a parent
[09:44:24] <ajpiano> freeed: you have to dispel yourself of the notion that a jQuery chain corresponds to "some position in the DOM"
[09:44:51] <ajpiano> it's a collection of elements - they may not be inside of the document at all
[09:45:16] <freeed> ahhah! that's what's messing me up. So after a remove, if I wanted to move through the chain to manipulate another element I would have to start the chain over with $('.foo') ?
[09:45:33] <ajpiano> no, you should have referenced it at the beginning :p
[09:45:48] <ajpiano> var foos = $(".foo");  foos.find(".bar").remove(); foos.addClass("whatevs") etc
[09:45:59] <freeed> haha :D k.. that's what I'll do instead
[09:46:05] <freeed> Thanks ajpiano :p
[09:46:08] <ajpiano> :)
[09:46:23] <anli> Found error, a div was covering
[09:47:56] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: did you see my question?
[09:48:39] <ajpiano> i have now
[09:49:21] <ajpiano> i can't answer that right now
[09:49:32] <ShawnRisk> okay no worries
[09:50:57] <xckpd7> is there an event for when I'm in an input and the value changes at all without refocusing?
[09:53:43] <shadykhan> if i want to load multiple json feeds on a page on a button click
[09:53:46] <shadykhan> what is the best way to do that?
[09:55:47] <Otineb> @ShawnRisk sorry, went for lunch. Just set the drop down's width to allow for the horizontal spread. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/a5f44/20/
[09:56:15] <freeed> Hey allâ€¦ isâ€¦   var foo = $('.foo')    foo.find('.bar')  really any quicker/better than just doing  $('.bar')  ?
[09:56:26] <ShawnRisk> Otineb: thanks I will look into that
[09:56:44] <ryanneufeld> freeed: if .bar is always within .foo, then yes
[09:56:58] <freeed> ryanneufeld, ok cool. It is.
[09:57:08] <ryanneufeld> freeed: or if you only want .bar that is within .foo
[09:58:06] <freeed> ryanneufeldn, yeah I am.. .foo is an instance so there may be many of them.
[09:58:28] <ryanneufeld> that's a common pattern
[09:58:53] <Otineb> hi everyone. I have an email validation script that prevents users from clicking submit before fixing the email format. true to its reputation, IE is the only browser it doesn't work on. (IE allows the form to submit with the incorrectly formatted email) Is there some caveat code I need to add to get IE to behave the same way? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/gLBDz/19/
[09:59:03] <ryanneufeld> freeed: you can also do var bar = $('.foo').find('.bar'); if you don't need the foos
[09:59:31] <gnarf> although at that point $( ".foo .bar" ) is prolly better ryanneufeld
[09:59:58] <freeed> thanks guys!
[10:02:16] <ryanneufeld> freeed: what gnarf siad
[10:02:19] <HarryPitfall> Otineb: I'm sorry to say, but validation always need to be done on server also. The client validation is fine just to decrease traffic of invalid information, but the server always need to recheck things
[10:04:14] <Otineb> @HarryPitfall Thanks for responding. I don't have access to the server side of this. My only tool at this point is front-end js. Is there anything I can do to make sure IE's submit button doesn't allow the user to continue until the script gives the 'green light' so to speak?
[10:10:44] <hallas> Anyone know why jQuery.ajax won't send my cookie?
[10:10:47] <hallas> Normal requests work just fine.
[10:14:52] <sunbeam> chee: thanks again
[10:15:04] <pifantastic> hallas: is the ajax request from the same path?
[10:15:13] <pifantastic> hallas: cookies can be tied to a path
[10:15:23] <hallas> pifantastic path is set to /
[10:15:36] <chee> sunbeam: no problem !
[10:15:49] <chee> sunbeam: i'm helping you in all the channels !
[10:15:55] <sunbeam> does anyone know whats the best way to slide to a #element
[10:15:57] <sunbeam> chee: lol yea :p
[10:16:12] <hallas> pifantastic is that signifcant?
[10:16:16] <chee> sunbeam: where are you sliding it from and where are you sliding it to?
[10:16:35] <pifantastic> hallas: the path for the cookie is '/'?
[10:16:40] <hallas> pifantastic yes
[10:16:49] <pifantastic> that should be OK then
[10:17:00] <hallas> the port is different however
[10:17:25] <chee> sunbeam: $( "element" ).animate({ left: "100px" }); ?
[10:18:33] <sunbeam> chee: im sliding to an element at the bottom of the page
[10:18:37] <sunbeam> or near the bottom
[10:18:44] <chee> oh slide *to* an element
[10:18:45] <chee> sorry
[10:18:55] <xckpd7> question: I'm doing $.when and waiting on 3 ajax calls
[10:19:15] <xckpd7> the problem is, one of the ajax calls returns successfully, but for all intensive purposes is empty
[10:19:39] <hallas> pifantastic its probably because the port, breaks origin policies
[10:19:56] <pifantastic> hallas: but wouldn't that break the ajax request also?
[10:20:11] <pifantastic> hallas: But yes, if it's a different port the cookie won't be sent
[10:20:15] <sunbeam> chee: i know there is scrollTo but I don't like the type of animation
[10:20:23] <pifantastic> I assumed that wasn't the case because I assumed your ajax request was working
[10:21:21] <otters> I want to detect when a node with a certain ID is added to the DOM and add an attribute to it
[10:21:24] <otters> is such a thing possible
[10:23:47] <otters> specifically an onchange attribute
[10:24:00] <otters> I could return it from the AJAX handler but that seems really messy and unnecessary
[10:25:50] <sunbeam> chee: here?
[10:25:56] <codephobic> hi
[10:27:11] <codephobic> What might cause ajax POST values (and their keys) to appear in the address bar appended to the url, like a GET request?
[10:27:16] <rgenito> heyyy
[10:29:51] <codephobic> anyone got any ideas?
[10:31:01] <codephobic> variables packaged with an ajax POST request should be sent along in the header, right? They shouldn't be visible in the browser's url
[10:32:41] <FrameFever> how can I move an element from one div to another?
[10:32:56] <FrameFever> with move I mean, attach
[10:33:29] <shadykhan> if i put an element in a variable and then remove that element in a function
[10:33:42] <shadykhan> will the variable still be able to call that element or no?
[10:33:52] <lathan> codephobic, you are correct
[10:33:56] <lathan> ?demo @ codelahoma
[10:33:57] <bot-t1> codelahoma, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:34:04] <xckpd7> question: inside of $.when, if you have 3 different ajax calls, what does ajaxResult represent?
[10:34:17] <lathan> sorry codelahoma

[10:35:08] <codephobic> ah, ok... dunno if that was a lag or not, just got a bunch of responses to my previous q.
[10:35:25] <lathan> codephobic, I answered several lines
[10:35:52] <codephobic> lathan, ah yes - I think I may be experiencing a little lag here
[10:37:22] <codephobic> I'll try and recreate the error, but it doesn't always occur. Just on occasion I see AJAX fail to execute the error or complete methods and instead just do a page refresh with the variables appended to the end of the url
[10:37:54] <lathan> codephobic, you are bing a submit to a form and doing an ajax post instead?
[10:38:44] <lathan> codephobic, that behavior means that something in your javascript handlers has errored out, and as such the event binding doesn't preventDefault
[10:38:47] <sunbeam> does anyone know whats the best way to slide to a #element
[10:38:51] <sunbeam> i know there is scrollTo but I don't like the type of animation

[10:42:50] <codephobic> lathan, I attached an ajax function to the submit event of a form. It all works fine most of the time, but occasionally, when I'm modifying things, I find that it spits the variables and values out in the browser address bar.
[10:43:13] <codephobic> I find this strange because, being a POST request, there should be nothing going to the url.
[10:43:24] <DukeDrake> if I try var myajax = $.post( ... )  - how can I access the returned data?
[10:43:34] <codephobic> this is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/codephobic/zMgUH/#base
[10:44:13] <sunbeam> lathan: i was just looking for a good way
[10:44:15] <lathan> DukeDrake, the last argument of $.post is a callback function to handle the response
[10:44:24] <lathan> ?$.post#sig @ DukeDrake
[10:44:26] <bot-t1> DukeDrake, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#sig
[10:45:10] <DukeDrake> lathan: I know. But I'd like to return the returned data to the calling function.
[10:46:46] <lathan> DukeDrake, it doesn't work like that
[10:49:08] <DukeDrake> lathan: yeah ... i figure ....
[10:50:07] <DukeDrake> :/
[10:53:44] <codephobic> with jquery is there a robust way to validate email addresses, without using plugins? I find plugins complicate matters for me, having to understand the developer's "thinking" before I can really use them. So I would much rather just code the steps/method myself.
[10:55:50] <mattgifford> I'm trying to do a cross-domain GET of an HTML document. I'm getting this in the console: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load [URL]. Cannot make any requests from null." Here is my code: https://gist.github.com/3947684 . Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[10:56:08] <awc737> anyone use Foundation Zurb know if it's ok to have a modal on top of another modal
[10:56:28] <dblosevn> mattgifford: your doing a cross domain get thats what your doing wrong
[10:56:51] <mattgifford> dblosevn: I had a feeling that was the problem. I need to use post?
[10:57:15] <dblosevn> you need to use nothing, cant request cross domain
[10:57:35] <dblosevn> can use jsonp, or a proxy script
[10:57:46] <FrameFever> what does "append" return?
[10:58:01] <dblosevn> a reference to the node appended
[10:58:03] <hareth> hello
[10:58:06] <mattgifford> dblosevn: So, crossDomain does nothing?
[10:58:12] <hareth> is there someone using dynatree here ?
[10:58:23] <gnarf> ?sop @mattgifford
[10:58:24] <bot-t1> mattgifford, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[11:06:43] <chasepeeler_work> how can I call a public class method from a jquery callback which has a different context? e.g http://pastie.org/5110478. Line 9 gives an error that myOtherFunction is not defined for the object
[11:09:34] <lathan> chasepeeler_work, you need to define the myCallback before using it
[11:09:42] <lathan> at least have var myCallback; above
[11:11:08] <sunbeam> does anyone know whats the best way to slide to a #element
[11:11:10] <sunbeam> scroll slide
[11:11:43] <chasepeeler_work> it's not having any issues executing the myCallback method, the error is coming after getting into that method...... would the order matter?
[11:13:05] <mattgifford> So, I understand same origin. I'm working with an app that already does ajax requests for json cross-domain successfully. These are json, not jsonp. It's using withCredentials and crossDomain for those calls. So, why does this request not work?
[11:15:19] <chasepeeler_work> okay, I got it. I made the method itself private, and then created a public property to access it
[11:15:26] <lathan> chasepeeler_work, this is more of a question for #javascript, ...
[11:15:34] <lathan> have you tried calling it by this.myCallback ?
[11:16:26] <chasepeeler_work> lathan: again, executing myCallback isn't the issue. It's the fact that myCallback has it's context changed by jQuery, making "this" no longer a reference to the class
[11:16:28] <ericw> Hi
[11:16:59] <ericw> i have some stuff setup like so: <div id="Product-Slider"><ul><li>list</li></ul></div>
[11:17:09] <ericw> i need to add a class to the ul
[11:17:22] <ericw> can someone give me a pointer on how to do that?
[11:17:27] <ericw> the correct terminology to search for
[11:17:28] <ericw> lol
[11:17:30] <lathan> chasepeeler_work, oh....yes, because jQuery does change context
[11:17:34] <Vinici> $("ul").addClass("nameOfTheClass")
[11:17:37] <shadykhan> if i use .html with a script tag in it why does it not repalce anything?
[11:18:00] <ericw> Vinici: Thanks, but I need to target first-child or something like that to div id="Product-Slider"
[11:18:08] <chasepeeler_work> lathan: and my original question was, how can I access public methods inside a callback where jQuery changed the context
[11:18:12] <ericw> i'm not even close to fluent with jquery but i can usually make things work
[11:18:53] <ericw> the other thing is, that the UL is actualy a variable so i'm concerned that it won't load as fast as the jquery so i'll need to run the jquery when the page finishes loading
[11:19:29] <ericw> which isn't abig deal but i think $("ul").addClass("nameOfTheClass") functions immediately on it's own
[11:19:43] <Vinici> ericw you can define a id to this ul and do $("#myId").addCla..... or $("ul").first().addClass..... or yet: $("ul:first-child").addCl.....
[11:20:29] <Vinici> by variable: var myUl = $("ul"); myUl.addClass("class");
[11:21:26] <ericw> well the parent will be a div id
[11:21:29] <ericw> i can't add a class to the UL
[11:21:37] <ericw> or an id to the ul
[11:21:42] <ericw> because the ul is generated by the variable
[11:22:19] <Vinici> so i don't understood, what do you want?
[11:22:20] <lathan> ericw, id, nodename and class selectors will be verry fast
[11:22:43] <lathan> and not really a need to save them just for 1 or 2 uses (performance wise, conveience and code clarity, yes)
[11:23:12] <Xtreme> jquery has anything like beep?
[11:23:53] <ericw> i think it needs to be something like on load, ul:first-child of div id addClass
[11:24:07] <hlve> like /beep ?
[11:25:05] <Xtreme> hlve, yes? like alert sound
[11:25:20] <Xtreme> something to indicate "you got new message ass, look at the chat box"
[11:26:30] <sunbeam> how can i execute a function when the user scrolls down?
[11:27:13] <sunbeam> or presses down
[11:27:29] <Vinici> sunbeam: $(window).bind('scrollstart', function(){ });
[11:27:42] <Dave_Stein> sunbeam: you can also bind to body and then use passed back even to know if they hit the downkey
[11:27:49] <sunbeam> thanks
[11:27:54] <Dave_Stein> if you have UI on the page there is $.ui.keyCodes for shortcuts
[11:28:13] <Vinici> there is also the scrollstop event
[11:28:18] <Dave_Stein> don't forget numpad down and regular down are diff codes
[11:29:54] <sunbeam> anyone in here uses relative font sizes with viewport units?
[11:34:43] <ericw> haha
[11:34:55] <ericw> sorry, i think that was easier than i expected
[11:35:13] <ericw> the hardest part was figuring out why my dual monitor PC setup, the mouse wouldn't jump over to my mac.
[11:35:20] <ericw> ;)
[11:39:46] <lz> ericw, you should see synergy, it lets you share a keyboard and mouse between systems
[11:45:34] <ericw> lz: thanks, i'll check it out
[11:46:44] <lz> ericw, np
[11:47:42] <ericw> aw you have to be on the same network
[11:47:48] <ericw> which would be fine in most cases except this one. lol
[11:48:16] <ericw> my macbook pro is on a separate wifi network and my pc is hardwired to a LAN network for VPN
[11:49:23] <lathan> ericw if you had an ssh server running on one of them you might be able to port forward....
[11:49:35] <lathan> (off topic a bit, lol)
[11:50:05] <ericw> lol, that'd be fun but i don't have the time to play with that. :(
[12:01:54] <khdkjfshjdk> How would one create this: http://i.imgur.com/iNiJL.png ? What is it called?
[12:02:53] <lathan> khdkjfshjdk, you would css style the dropdown with it hidden, and bind a click/toggle to the top button to show/hide the menu
[12:03:23] <darrennnn> should be an easy answer, what should i be doing? http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/XJAvQ/ i am getting no method "val"
[12:07:09] <lathan> darrennnn, because .get(0) or 1 returns the html element, not wrapped in a jQuery object
[12:07:19] <lathan> darrennnn, either change it to .value (native JS)
[12:07:47] <darrennnn> ohh shit. duh
[12:07:50] <lathan> darrennnn, or change it to $inputs.first().val() and $inputs.filter(':eq(1)')
[12:08:01] <lathan> darrennnn, you can use eq
[12:08:04] <lathan> ?eq
[12:08:05] <bot-t1> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:09:20] <ericw> hmmmm
[12:09:28] <ericw> how do i add an ID to a UL?
[12:09:29] <ericw> haha
[12:09:33] <ericw> i realized i added a class
[12:09:43] <ericw> but i've been developing all of this to work with ID's and not classes
[12:10:32] <darrennnn> .attr("id","foo") should work but there may be a slicker way. i am a newb ericw
[12:10:35] <lathan> $('ul').attr('id','newID')
[12:11:00] <lathan> ericw, I'm not entirely sure if that works with IE, I think at one moment it had a hissy fit if you tried to add an id
[12:11:53] <darrennnn> lathan: if you don't mind helping me a bit more i am having trouble separating the jquery object side of it from the actual element side
[12:12:33] <lathan> darrennnn, jQuery finds a native HTML element, and it wraps a layer of its functions around it to help.
[12:12:39] <darrennnn> in my inputs example, making it generic, ... i can't just perform jq methods on a subsection of a jq collection?
[12:12:39] <lathan> darrennnn, .val() is one of those functions
[12:12:55] <lathan> darrennnn, .get is designed to give you access to the native element
[12:12:55] <xSmurf> as anyone made an easy to use webkitAudioContext <audio> object replacement library?
[12:13:01] <darrennnn> because each() kind of works that way no? or am i thinking it wrong
[12:13:13] <lathan> darrennnn, what you want is similar to get, but keeps it in jQuery, see ?eq
[12:13:14] <bot-t1> darrennnn, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:13:29] <lathan> $inputs.eq(0).val()
[12:13:32] <lathan> $inputs.eq(1).val()
[12:13:39] <darrennnn> ill re-read it
[12:14:02] <lathan> darrennnn, you don't need to reread it...just replace .get() with eq
[12:14:04] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/XJAvQ/1/
[12:14:11] <darrennnn> oh.
[12:14:14] <lathan> excuse me...you should always read
[12:14:34] <lathan> but eq is the version of get that leaves it in a jQuery object
[12:14:44] <darrennnn> haha yeah i wanted to read just to try to get a better understanding. the element/jquery object line gets blurry often for me
[12:15:00] <darrennnn> so i did it right conceptually, i just had the wrong method?
[12:16:13] <lathan> yes
[12:16:33] <darrennnn> okay thank you lathan, that helps calm my nerves a bit.
[12:16:37] <darrennnn> ty for your time.
[12:16:55] <lathan> ?np @ darkc0met
[12:16:55] <bot-t1> darkc0met, No Problem
[12:16:58] <lathan> sry darkc0met
[12:17:00] <lathan> np darrennnn
[12:24:19] <sunbeam> is there an easy way to have <img> shrink relatively to the window size?
[12:25:50] <gf3> sunbeam: width: 100%;
[12:25:55] <gf3> ?boom
[12:25:55] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[12:26:48] <sunbeam> owww
[12:26:52] <sunbeam> yea of course
[12:28:13] <sunbeam> gf3: but i dont want it to grow in size
[12:28:21] <sunbeam> the max width should be something like the actual image width
[12:29:00] <gf3> sunbeam: max-width: 500px; width: 100%;
[12:29:05] <gf3> ?boom
[12:29:05] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[12:29:06] <gf3> ?boom
[12:29:07] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[12:31:12] <tUze> hello
[12:33:11] <lathan> ?hi
[12:33:11] <bot-t1> Hey lathan
[12:34:03] <tUze> anyone know JS libraries to animate images on mouseover for a gallery?
[12:34:13] <resno> i havea long listing of elements, can jquery parse the page and actupon that elements?
[12:34:22] <resno> using something like regexp
[12:34:46] <lathan> ?jquery cycle
[12:34:50] <bot-t1> lathan, Cycle Plugin - jQuery Plugins - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
[12:34:54] <lathan> tUze, ^^^^^
[12:35:11] <jrajav> resno: Why would you need regexp?
[12:35:15] <lathan> tUze, I'm sure you can specify which event it should use to animate
[12:35:22] <jrajav> resno: Is it something that selectors aren't powerful enough for?
[12:36:00] <resno> jrajav: the cms im forced to use delivers the results all the same. so, it doesnt give me anything to sleect. in my mind
[12:36:07] <lathan> resno, jQuery can help you do a lot
[12:36:10] <someish> does anyone know of a good method for selecting all hashtags?
[12:36:18] <jrajav> resno: Yet you say you have a long listing of elements...
[12:36:22] <lathan> resno, have to have some example
[12:36:31] <resno> yepone sec
[12:36:36] <jrajav> resno: Describe with words what it is you want to act upon and what you want to do
[12:37:03] <lathan> someish, $('a[href][href*=#]').each(function(){...})
[12:37:27] <lathan> someish, obviously you may not need the [href] in there
[12:37:34] <resno> ive gothis page: http://pastebin.com/GrDXu3TM
[12:37:50] <resno> i want to take a few links and hide them
[12:38:11] <resno> but no way to select that particular item
[12:38:20] <lathan> someish, also like: $('a').filter(function(){ return $(this).attr('href').indexOf('#') > -1 })
[12:38:28] <someish> lathan, I want to select all text that has a space preceding the '#' and all letters that directly follow it
[12:38:32] <lathan> that gives you all the a's with # in the href
[12:38:37] <lathan> someish, oh...different hashtag
[12:38:53] <lathan> someish, is this searching the whole page, or a given string / element ?
[12:39:35] <someish> lathan, it will search a containing div.
[12:40:14] <NoiseEee> someish: i think your only choice is regex'ing
[12:41:06] <someish> NoiseEee, I figured as much.
[12:41:08] * resno twiddles thumbs
[12:41:16] <lathan> someish, var str= $('div').text();
[12:41:16] <lathan> while(var match=str.replace(/(#[^ ]*)/,'')){ match = match[1]; /// |
[12:41:32] <lathan> someish, this is a verry non-jQuery thing...I don't know of any special jQuery magic to help
[12:41:50] <someish> lathan, fair enough. thanks for your help.
[12:42:36] <someish> lathan, have you seen this? http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[12:43:37] <lathan> someish, I haven't, but that is just finding the divs that match a regex
[12:43:55] <lathan> someish, you need something to loop over all occurances of #[^ ]*
[12:45:04] <lathan> someish, look at this example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5835418/javascript-regexp-loop-all-matches#answer-5835642
[12:45:33] <someish> lathan, nice. thanks for the resource.
[12:45:35] <lathan> someish, ignore the LinkID and stuff, but they are while looping over all occurances of a regex
[12:45:39] <lathan> ?np @ someish
[12:45:40] <bot-t1> someish, No Problem
[12:46:02] <jrajav> resno: Sorry, which particular item?
[12:46:48] <resno> jrajav: so like line 62
[12:47:28] <resno> jrajav: 53 would actually be better. hide 54 to 61
[12:48:06] <lathan> resno, what you want is to hide them by matching part of the url?
[12:48:09] <jrajav> So what is it about line 53, why do you want to act on that specifically?
[12:48:11] <lathan> ?has
[12:48:11] <bot-t1> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[12:48:14] <jrajav> And what do you want to do to them?
[12:48:32] <lathan> $('tr:has(a[href*=Chemistry])').hide()
[12:48:36] <jrajav> Yeah, basically, how would you match the elements you want?
[12:48:39] <lathan> resno, like that ^
[12:48:51] <resno> lathan: yes, so. in this case, the ending is *00
[12:48:54] <jrajav> (i.e. how would you describe the elements you want in plain English)
[12:48:55] <lathan> okay
[12:49:03] <lathan> just use the [href=$=00]
[12:49:11] <jrajav> $=
[12:49:15] <lathan> $('tr:has(a[ref$=00])').hide()
[12:49:21] <lathan> yes
[12:49:51] <resno> that simple?
[12:49:55] <lathan> yep
[12:50:00] <jrajav> Welcome to jQuery. :P
[12:50:02] <lathan> jQuery does a ton of work for you
[12:50:07] * jedimind hugs jquery
[12:50:12] * jedimind grabs a little ass
[12:50:17] <lathan> resno, the secret is: every character counts in that selector string
[12:50:17] <jrajav> Do you need to wrap 00 in quotes?
[12:50:28] <lathan> jrajav, not required, but recommended
[12:50:32] <resno> a side question, plugins vs not using.. any difference issue?
[12:50:33] <lathan> but it get's confusing with ' and "
[12:50:47] <jrajav> I've always used '' for JS strings
[12:50:53] <jrajav> So I just always use "" in selectors
[12:50:55] <lathan> resno, a plugin is no different in performance than a regular jQuery function
[12:51:10] <lathan> resno, however: plugins may have less support than vanilla jQuery
[12:51:27] <lathan> resno, plugins may have bugs...may not be updated, may not have full cross browser support
[12:51:43] <lathan> resno, unless you find a good community maintaining it
[13:02:22] <Nachtwind> hi, i have a small problem with a "sortable" i currently move items from list_a to list_b and check in list_b with a variable (in receive()) weather or not the sortable is full. If it is full i call $("ul.list_b").cancel() to stop the drag drop - but that seems not to be the way to do it as the item is still dropped into place. is there any better way to achieve that?

[13:31:04] <dblosevn> synju: sounds like jquery is not being included on the page or you are including code that depends on jquery before jquery itself has been included
[13:31:04] <systemfault> Then include jQuery to the page.

[13:37:08] <ericw> i'm sort of a jack of all trades
[13:37:14] <ericw> i can program, but my specialty is design
[13:37:20] <dblosevn> me too but still dont mean i dont hate design
[13:37:23] <synju> lol dblosevn I agree... I got bored of design and well.. just TIRED of it...
[13:37:34] <anew_> not sure what i need here, if someone clicks a 'submit' button o my site i want to tell them to login first... that's not really a .validate() thing, what should i use ?
[13:37:48] <synju> I love design, just not designing websites for WORK bleh
[13:37:52] <ericw> i don't mind reinventing the wheel as long as i'm making ok money. ;)

[13:39:18] <ericw> i just finished the Salesforce blog development last week
[13:39:22] <ericw> or last month
[13:39:23] <ericw> lol
[13:39:35] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com

[13:40:03] <someprimetime> say i have a mustache.js template like <script id="js-social-btn-template" type="text/x-bl-template"> {{pinterest_url}} </script> how can i grab the {{pinterest_url}} in my js? (for those of you using mustache)
[13:40:14] <NoiseEee> anew_: you need the backend (not javascript) to provide a means of letting you know if the user is logged in. this can be a database table, or something like a php $_SESSION
[13:40:20] <ShawnRisk> hi
[13:40:20] <ericw> dblosevn: why aren't you programming for cross compatibility?
[13:40:29] <dblosevn> this isnt a website
[13:40:36] <ericw> ah gotcha
[13:40:39] <dblosevn> its for hardware thats under my control
[13:40:48] <ericw> sweet, in that case who cares
[13:40:48] <ericw> haha
[13:40:57] <anew_> yes i have session to check if the user is logged in.. but when they click the button and not logged in... what do i do ?
[13:41:03] <dblosevn> it just happens to be web accessible lol
[13:41:05] <anew_> NoiseEee
[13:41:14] <Manxa> can someone tell me why .complete() isn't working? http://dpaste.org/81cfO/

[13:41:41] <ericw> i did http://www.diageoworldclassusa.org
[13:41:41] <someprimetime> salesforce has the weirdest logo
[13:41:49] <anew_> meh, i guess i can create in html and php... but wanted something in jquery....how is this not possible
[13:41:49] <someprimetime> ANTI SOFTWARE
[13:41:55] <ericw> sorry it's .com
[13:41:56] <ericw> not .org
[13:41:56] <ericw> haha
[13:41:57] <dblosevn> lol
[13:42:03] <dblosevn> was gonna say thats AWESOME
[13:42:48] <ericw> there's a lot of problems with that website
[13:43:00] <dblosevn> what site?
[13:43:00] <ericw> we had a short deadline and then once we reached the deadline they needed to use the website immediately
[13:43:03] <dblosevn> oh
[13:43:04] <ericw> diageoworldclassusa.com
[13:43:17] <ericw> and they wouldn't let me fix it afterwards.
[13:43:20] <dblosevn> ya, i had to play cleanup behind a russian on that one
[13:43:24] <ericw> i also do rosenblum cellars and sterling vineyards
[13:43:30] <ericw> working on a game for hahn winery
[13:43:39] <dblosevn> i billed 140 hours in 9 days on catkiosk
[13:43:47] <ericw> haha, yeah i'm cleaning up this crushpad companies 6 servers from india
[13:44:13] <dblosevn> im rebuilding that for android startiung next week
[13:44:19] <dblosevn> *android
[13:44:23] <ericw> nice
[13:44:26] <Derezo> ericw: Did you design that site solo?
[13:44:35] <ericw> which one?
[13:44:43] <Derezo> diageoworldclassuse.com
[13:44:45] <Derezo> usa*
[13:44:46] <Derezo> :P
[13:44:48] <ericw> i don't typically do the design
[13:44:51] <dblosevn> they already have an ios app for it
[13:44:52] <ericw> i'm mostly a developer
[13:44:55] <ericw> clients design it. haha
[13:45:04] <ericw> they tell me what they want, especially with the big companies
[13:45:18] <dblosevn> all my stuff mainly is already designed when i get the project, just needs to be sliced and diced
[13:45:21] <Derezo> I've been designing small sites, most of them less than $1000
[13:45:30] <Derezo> was curious on the hours put into that one
[13:45:46] <Onkeltem> Hey, does anybody here know how to re-init object which was created using $.extend?
[13:45:48] <ericw> http://blogs.salesforce.com was a 100 hour job
[13:46:06] <ericw> http://castlegatecap.com was like a 40 hour job maybe?
[13:46:26] <ericw> i didn't really keep track of castlegatecap, i just worked on that in the evenings for like a month
[13:46:32] <ericw> and it was a flat rate website, not hourly
[13:46:33] <NoiseEee> f salesforce
[13:47:11] <Derezo> I always bill flat rate, but usually base it on an hour estimate
[13:47:28] <ericw> Derezo: it's the small businesses or personal websites that people want you to do the design for
[13:47:38] <Derezo> Cool sites though
[13:47:47] <ericw> big corporations have UI designers separate from UI developers
[13:48:00] <Derezo> I do *everything* right now, but they're all small businesses.
[13:48:08] <ericw> and designs have to go through a chain of command and marketing peeps
[13:48:16] <ericw> then when it's approved they hand it over to the developer
[13:48:16] <Derezo> largest project was 80 hours for a ~30 employee company
[13:48:24] <Derezo> www.tghsafety.com
[13:48:34] <dblosevn> ya all my ui is already done for me when i get most of my projects I just have to hire somebody to cut up the psd's
[13:48:46] <ericw> yeah i can do everything also.. for one wine company i do design, development, server admin, database admin, etc.. on 6 servers. lol
[13:48:57] <Derezo> heh, geez
[13:49:23] <ericw> nice
[13:49:39] <ericw> dblosevn: slicing psd's is simple
[13:50:02] <ericw> i actually found that being a developer gives me more insight on where to slice, so i would rather do it myself
[13:50:14] <dblosevn> im not good at it though and i end up with a ton of markup i dont need
[13:50:19] <ericw> most people make huge slices and don't know that you can just repeat-x or repeat-y
[13:50:49] <ericw> or they don't export for web and you end up with massive PNG's and require editing anyways
[13:50:55] <ericw> if you want it done right, do it yourself. ;)
[13:50:59] <Derezo> yeah
[13:51:18] <ericw> i'm going to run grab something to eat, i'm getting hungry
[13:51:20] <Xtreme> can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong here?
[13:51:21] <Xtreme> http://pastebin.com/QicQbDk8
[13:51:28] <dblosevn> ive got a pretty good somolian I normally use and hes pretty well in sync with what i expect
[13:51:41] <ericw> have to run to walnut creek immediately after work to check out an apartment so i won't have time to eat. lol
[13:51:48] <dblosevn> he just went back to college though so i only get him everyonce in a while
[13:51:58] <ericw> dblosevn: keep my name. ;)
[13:52:00] <ericw> or at least my URL
[13:52:03] <ericw> http://evolvstudios.com
[13:52:11] <ericw> i do a lot of side work and sub out a lot of work too
[13:52:17] <ericw> people that work under me who are also developers and designers
[13:52:29] <dblosevn> the clients I work for usually are real dicks when it comes to the design
[13:52:29] <ericw> bbs
[13:52:59] <dblosevn> they will like overlay the psd's with the final products and make me make them line up lol
[13:53:44] <systemfault> Man... it's so difficult to get good web designers :/
[13:53:56] <Derezo> I always warn people that I'm not a designer, but they're usually OK with my portfolio
[13:54:14] <dblosevn> like that catkiosk site I wanted to make that template fluid but they insisted on 1920x 1080
[13:54:27] <Derezo> ugh
[13:54:46] <NoiseEee> "hi, i know im not a designer, but I know better than you, the professional"
[13:54:51] <NoiseEee> 1920 x lol
[13:54:53] <dblosevn> now they want to be able to distribute the kiosk to retailers for use on what ever pcs they decide to throw it on
[13:55:30] <dblosevn> and im like dude you put your self in a corner requireing 1920x1080
[13:55:46] <nym> does anyone here know how to install jshint from source?
[13:55:58] <nym> i can build it fine, but i'm not sure what files to copy over
[13:57:03] <dblosevn> nym: http://www.jshint.com/platforms/
[13:58:20] <nym> dblosevn: thanks!
[13:58:49] <dblosevn> np google is your friend lol
[13:58:55] <nym> i googled
[13:59:11] <dblosevn> nym: https://www.google.com/search?q=install+jshint+from+source
[13:59:13] <nym> i don't like to ask on irc without researching first, thanks for finding the link
[13:59:18] <dblosevn> 3rd link
[13:59:29] <nym> guess you have better google-fu
[13:59:46] <MagmaRules> Hi there im trying to implement some layout management like eclipse workbench, anyone knows if this has been attempted?
[13:59:49] <dblosevn> lmao i dont care i wasnt doing anything anyways lol
[14:03:45] <pehlert> Folks, I realized that when using on('click'), the event's target is not necessarily the link but can also be an element wrapped by the link. What's the recommended way to get the link's href attribute?
[14:04:39] <dblosevn> this.href inside the click handler
[14:06:36] <pehlert> dblosevn: Thanks
[14:12:01] <k1t> hello folks
[14:13:13] <k1t> I am trying to let a user "drag" over words, which will consequently highlight them. The words are in the form of a paragraph and i already have each word in its own element but i am trying to think of how to detect the user dragging over each one, word to word
[14:13:24] <k1t> Any ideas on where I might begin to achieve this behavior?
[14:14:10] <k1t> so each word the user drags over would likely add a class to that element, thats fine, its more about detecting each element and firing an even after each element has been dragged over
[14:18:48] <razzi> k1t, maybe there's a better way, but I would just read the html of the paragraph, split the words into an array and write new html to the array with a <span> around each word.
[14:19:28] <k1t> i already do that but i need to detect dragover events for each one
[14:19:31] <razzi> after that you would be able to select the words by selecting the spans.
[14:19:40] <k1t> i suppose it could just be a dragover listener, right?
[14:19:50] <k1t> for whatever class that span has around each word ?
[14:19:58] <k1t> (since im already putting each word into its own span element)
[14:20:08] <razzi> do you mean hover?
[14:20:19] <k1t> no, mousedown while dragging
[14:20:30] <k1t> essentail dragging over the paragraph, word-by-word
[14:21:10] <razzi> does a dragover event exist?
[14:21:12] <k1t> essentially, bad typo lol
[14:21:44] <darrennnn> i am using keyup to check when something is typed in properly, but if you type fast you get the event firing multiple times. how should i approach this better? http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/nrCb2/
[14:22:09] <razzi> if there's no such event, you could catch mouseover event and see if the mouse is over any of the spans.
[14:23:10] <k1t> razzi: not sure
[14:23:18] <NoiseEee> darrennnn: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ / http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation
[14:23:20] <k1t> razzi: that makes sense though, re: mouseover
[14:23:53] <razzi> k1t, yeah but you'll need to somehow check if there's actually dragging going on
[14:24:08] <k1t> must be somethin out there discussing this
[14:25:45] <darrennnn> NoiseEee: interesting! is there an alternate approach than the one i used? or is debouncing events extremely common best practice
[14:26:09] <NoiseEee> darrennnn: debouncing is the way to go, its precisely whats up in yo' stuff
[14:26:37] <darrennnn> okay great. only remaining question is why isnt debouncing events built into jquery?
[14:27:08] <darrennnn> assuming this is an extremely common problem
[14:28:01] <NoiseEee> darrennnn: its a JS solution to a somewhat common problem; built-into = bloat; plugins = yay
[14:28:22] <darrennnn> okay cool. thanks for your help NoiseEee
[14:28:27] <darrennnn> sincerely appreciated.
[14:28:29] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[14:31:27] <ShawnRisk> If I run this code: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/11/ by pushing the run button on jsfiddle, almost everything works.  There are three problems: One is that if I click on sublink the sublinks don't show up when the page loads.  Another problem is that the toplinks are not highlighted at all to say that is the section it is on if I click the sublinks.  Last problem, the toplink highlighted stays all the time, when if I hover over other toplinks the highlight shou
[14:35:10] <codephobic> with jquery is there a robust way to validate email addresses, without using plugins? I find plugins complicate matters for me, having to understand the developer's "thinking" before I can really use them. So I would much rather just code the steps/method myself.
[14:35:49] <razzi> codephobic, google it, there are several regular expressions for it
[14:36:44] <codephobic> razzi, I've seen a few but I want to know how people generally apply them, whether on submit, on blur, exclusively on the php/server side ...?
[14:37:08] <codephobic> I'm new to the whole jquery/javascript/ajax thing, so trying to get an understanding of everything I'm doing.
[14:37:54] <razzi> codephobic, I personally prefer server side with PHP, but others do the checks on submit.
[14:38:58] <codephobic> ah
[14:39:26] <k1t> razzi: http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag
[14:39:27] <k1t> :)
[14:39:34] <k1t> Very nice stuff here
[14:42:18] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[14:42:28] <codephobic> Another q, is making $.ajax calls on 'blur' to check whether an email address or username is already registered on the database, as the user fills out a form, a bad idea in terms of performance/usability? I see it deployed on quite a few websites in their registration process, but not sure if all those ajax calls will impact sites heavily (smaller, shared hosting sites).
[14:46:01] <HyShai> Hi
[14:46:55] <HyShai> I'm having issues with the open event of the Autocomplete function
[14:46:57] <HyShai> http://jsfiddle.net/GcVvm/
[14:47:56] <HyShai> When the open event is fired the second time the callback function isn't called....
[14:48:29] <HyShai> Only the first time is the margin-top 20px
[14:48:39] <HyShai> http://jsfiddle.net/GcVvm/
[14:49:04] <HyShai> sorry this is the link http://jsfiddle.net/GcVvm/4/
[14:52:58] <darrennnn> someone familiar with debounce plugin... can you quickly help me understand why http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/nrCb2/7/ works and http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/nrCb2/8/ does not
[14:53:07] <darrennnn> very simple examples
[14:53:57] <HyShai> actually it's specifically a margin-top issue for some reason it only changes the first time open event fires
[14:55:30] <Xtreme> how to scroll to the bottom of a dynamically populated div?
[14:58:57] <codephobic> Xtreme, can't you dynamically create an anchor at the bottom and then trigger it after populating the div?
[14:59:37] <HyShai> can someone help me with my autocomplete issue?
[15:00:06] <HyShai> http://jsfiddle.net/GcVvm/4/ margin-top only changes the 1st time the open event happens
[15:00:14] <HyShai> what's up witht that?
[15:00:33] <Nachtwind> hi, i have a small problem with a "sortable" i currently move items from list_a to list_b and check in list_b with a variable (in receive()) weather or not the sortable is full. If it is full i call $("ul.list_b").cancel() to stop the drag drop - but that seems not to be the way to do it as the item is still dropped into place. is there any better way to achieve that?
[15:02:44] <Nachtwind> oh, nvm
[15:02:46] <Nachtwind> got it
[15:03:30] <ShawnRisk> aren't those the best questions?
[15:03:55] <Nachtwind> yeah, at least for me... been fiddling with that all evening and now found the asnwer myself
[15:04:34] <ShawnRisk> I wish my question was that easy
[15:04:41] <awc737> can an html input[type='text'] have a different value="" than it's visible text value?
[15:04:57] <awc737> in otherwords, can i put the text name in the input field, and the id in value=""
[15:05:15] <Nachtwind> ShawnRisk: would loive to help, but no idea on your problem
[15:05:17] <Nachtwind> sorry
[15:05:25] <codephobic> awc737, yes. Atleast that's what happens when you use placeholder in HTML5
[15:05:28] <ShawnRisk> Nachtwind: no worries
[15:05:49] <da-beginner> hi there.. i have an object like this var requestObjects = { 	name:"type", 	str:"str"};   how do i push another value pair into the object?
[15:06:20] <ShawnRisk> Nachtwind: very complex :D
[15:08:08] <Nachtwind> too complex for someone first getting into jquery
[15:08:30] <codephobic> da-beginner, do you mean to just add more pairs literally? like say var requestObject = { name:"type",  str:"str",  val3:"val3",  val4:"val4" }?
[15:08:52] <awc737> so codephobic , which of these will post:
[15:08:54] <awc737> $("input[name='parent_id']").val('x')
[15:08:54] <awc737> 	$("input[name='parent_id']").attr('value', 'y')
[15:09:20] <awc737> i'd like to put something in 'x', and have 'y' post
[15:09:48] <codephobic> awc737, post? hmm, I'm not quite sure how you mean to apply this.
[15:09:51] <shoky> HyShai: http://jsfiddle.net/GcVvm/6/
[15:10:06] <awc737> it's in a form
[15:10:11] <awc737> i mean which value will POST
[15:10:36] <da-beginner> codephobic : i think it's just requestObjects.whateverkey = anothervalue
[15:10:47] <ShawnRisk> codephobic: any thoughts on mine?
[15:10:51] <codephobic> awc737, I just use placeholder to store the default text within an input field : <input id=username type=text placeholder="username..." ...
[15:11:16] <codephobic> ShawnRisk, other than ("too complicated for me") nope. Sorry :(
[15:11:21] <awc737> me too but this is different
[15:11:34] <awc737> i think what i need is to use a hidden input field, and just a label to display the name
[15:11:44] <awc737> i'm trying to POST the ID, but display the name
[15:12:22] <codephobic> awc737, hmm, that doesn't sound like it should be difficult
[15:12:46] <awc737> you mean using a hidden field instead of the text field
[15:13:10] <codephobic> awc737, var inpId = $('#inp').attr('id') ...
[15:13:31] <codephobic> then post inpId along with whatever variables you're sending to the server
[15:13:41] <awc737> i'm not using jquery to post
[15:13:52] <codephobic> awc737, ah.
[15:14:07] <awc737> the form will just grab all the input values with names
[15:14:32] <awc737> and see the problem is i'm using typeahead, so i want the user to be able to type 'group name' for instance
[15:14:41] <awc737> and it will find the group name to make sure they select a real one
[15:14:46] <awc737> but i realy want to post the ID
[15:15:43] <ShawnRisk> is there an advance jQuery channel?
[15:16:15] <awc737> ShawnRisk, you will be notified of it when you graduate noob status
[15:16:20] <codephobic> awc737, hmm... I think this is a little too complicated for me, tbh. I'm pretty much a newbie but I recently wrote a little function to swap out placeholder text and as part of my research, found out how to store ids and stuff...
[15:18:36] <awc737> no prob, i'll mess with it, thanks though
[15:19:05] <codephobic> awc737, it's an interesting problem. hope you find a solution soon :)
[15:19:37] <awc737> thanks
[15:21:48] <codephobic> awc737, just thinking it through ... input field generates a value that you want to store to a variable, then inject that value into the 'id' of an expression to gather a group of elements?
[15:22:16] <awc737> i don't need a group of elements
[15:22:48] <awc737> i have a field on create-new-group form called parent_id. it is a lookup field of all the groups so you can select one to be the parent
[15:23:07] <awc737> when you select one, i'd like to display the group name in the textbox field, but actually POST the id
[15:24:26] <razzi> awc, why don't you just use a <select> ?
[15:25:19] <awc737> i didn't think of that
[15:25:33] <ShawnRisk> awc737: pardon?
[15:25:47] <awc737> i can't really use a drop down though
[15:26:01] <awc737> because there will be a LOT in the lookup function, and nested filters etc
[15:26:16] <awc737> but maybe i could just have a single select option be displayed after the pick one
[15:26:27] <razzi> sighn
[15:26:44] <razzi> what's wrong with your own suggestion above?
[15:26:56] <awc737> a select with one option?
[15:27:16] <razzi> use a <input type="hidden"> for the id field and display the name anywhere you want
[15:27:50] <TelFiRE> Hey all. Quick best practice question. I have jQuery that only runs on the home page. It's nothing massive, like 200 lines that would probably be only 50 if not for all the formatting. If I wrap this in a jQuery check to see if the body hasClass('front') is it ok for it to load on every page? Or is it really bad practice to load a jQuery that won't be run?
[15:28:20] <awc737> oh razzi , the problem with that is the textbox is also a typeahead field with group names
[15:28:28] <awc737> so they could also start typing the group name rather than look it up
[15:28:41] <razzi> so what?
[15:29:04] <razzi> you make this simple thing much more complicated than it is.
[15:29:24] <awc737> razzi, so then i'm back to the problem of we have a text field with a name
[15:29:27] <awc737> and i need to POST the id
[15:30:43] <TelFiRE> Is it accurate that what's in an if() statement never gets evaluated or uses any cpu power if the if() is false?
[15:31:09] <awc737> razzi, it is that simple?
[15:31:11] <razzi> TelFire, it's a trade-off between maintainabily and website performance
[15:31:23] <awc737> you first said don't use a text input field, just display the name and use a hidden id field
[15:31:38] <awc737> but then i said i need a text input field for typeahead
[15:31:51] <TelFiRE> razzi: I realize it has to load the js file, so there's an extra few kb there, but I'm more concerned with whether or not it's going to try and actually evaluate this code
[15:32:13] <razzi> Telfire, the js will be cached, the cost will be one HTTP request
[15:32:16] <TelFiRE> as long as the if is false I would only require the CPU power it takes to check the body class right? none of the inside code would happen?
[15:32:55] <TelFiRE> Yeah separating my js out to multiple files becomes extra requests which I don't want. I'd like to keep it all in this one file, and just do if(body.hasClass('blah'){ to check what pages im on... is that bad
[15:32:56] <razzi> TelFire, the HTTP request for cached files can be avoided, google for it
[15:33:30] <TelFiRE> well the js file needs to load, it has stuff which happens on every page
[15:33:41] <TelFiRE> the question is whether I should take the bit that only runs on the home page, and put it in a script that only loads on the home page
[15:33:43] <razzi> TelFire, talking about CPU power in this case is in the realm of micro-optimization
[15:34:12] <razzi> TelFire, what makes you think I didn't understand your question?
[15:34:21] <TelFiRE> I don't understand why you're complicating it :s I'm asking a yes or no question
[15:34:48] <razzi> yes, you're an idiot.
[15:35:00] <TelFiRE> that's cool, thanks for being so helpful
[15:35:54] <TelFiRE> not sure where the hell that came from but you got a shitty attitude for someone hanging out in a help room and responding to help requests
[15:41:23] <mouses> how can i select multiple elements through variables for a click event? i tried:  $(link1, link2).click(function(){//...})  but only link1 worked
[15:42:37] <Aidan88> mouses what are the variables? Dom nodes? Strings?
[15:42:48] <mouses> dom nodes
[15:43:07] <Aidan88> Tried passing them in as an array?
[15:43:18] <mouses> no
[15:43:28] <Aidan88> $([link1, link2]).length
[15:43:32] <Aidan88> see if that is 2
[15:44:58] <mouses> yup its 2
[15:45:58] <Aidan88> mouses you're good to go then
[15:46:04] <Aidan88> $([link1, link2]).click etc
[15:47:38] <mouses> hmm that wont work at all now
[15:47:41] <mouses> for either link
[15:48:49] <coldhead> dead echoes don't come back
[15:49:49] <Aidan88> No reason why it shouldn't mouses
[15:49:52] <Aidan88> Check syntax?
[15:50:05] <mouses> lemme look deeper
[15:51:14] <mouses> i can resort to putting a class on each and selecting  $(".linkclass").click(function(){})
[15:51:25] <mouses> but i'd rather keep my code consistent
[15:53:28] <mouses> $([link1, link2]).click(function(){}) doesnt work
[16:01:21] <mouses> Aidan88:
[16:01:22] <mouses> http://jsfiddle.net/B2pE8/
[16:01:27] <mouses> check that out bro
[16:02:29] <mouses> ignore my mistake in the $(wrap) syntax, i forgot the "#"
[16:02:35] <mouses> but it still appends properly
[16:05:09] <Aidan88> mouses looking
[16:09:03] <Aidan88> mouses: $(link1).add(link2).click(function(){
[16:09:04] <Aidan88> alert("clicked!!");
[16:09:04] <Aidan88> });
[16:11:44] <mouses> ok thanks, worked
[16:11:50] <mouses> however that doesnt seem semantic
[16:11:59] <mouses> is there a better named functin for this purpose in jquery?
[16:13:13] <coldhead> add() is pretty semantic to me
[16:13:57] <mouses> well thanks dude
[16:14:03] <mouses> bbl
[16:14:10] <Aidan88> Well the array 'should' work
[16:14:12] <coldhead> playground martyrs
[16:14:23] <Aidan88> Not sure why it isn't - something else funny is happening probably
[16:14:34] <Aidan88> Need to check they are actual dom nodes
[16:15:12] <Aidan88> ah ok
[16:15:18] <Aidan88> I didn't check the rest of the code
[16:15:46] <Aidan88> mouses you need an array of raw dom nodes to pass as an array
[16:16:57] <awc737> does anyone have a preference between jquery UI autocomplete, and bootstrap typeahead?
[16:17:14] <Aidan88> var rawArray = jQuery.makeArray([link1, link2]);
[16:17:26] <MrPunkin> Anyone have any tips for rendering markdown-formatted JSON response? It seems the idea of formatting it server side and sending HTML in the JSON is a no-no. So if I just send the data  in JSON anyone have a good markdown formatter for client side that's lightweight?
[16:17:29] <Aidan88> and pass rawArray to $
[16:18:16] <razzi> Aidan88, mouses, you could try $.merge()
[16:19:39] <Krinkle> awc737: In terms of abilities they are similar
[16:19:53] <Krinkle> awc737: the better question would be what you prefer for other plugins
[16:20:01] <awc737> jquery UI's documentation seems to have more...
[16:20:05] <Krinkle> you wouldn't want 2 different dialog styles mixed on 1 site
[16:20:13] <awc737> but yeah your right, except bootstrap's typeahead is standalone
[16:20:17] <awc737> not sure about jquery UI's
[16:20:27] <awc737> i haven't used either for anything yet, so i'm not sure
[16:20:42] <Krinkle> awc737: jquery ui autocomplete needs jquery ui core, but isn't an issue
[16:20:51] <Krinkle> either way, they look crap without the css obviously
[16:21:08] <awc737> i'm not using BS css
[16:21:12] <Krinkle> so if you already use bootstrap, use that. if you already use jquery ui, use that.
[16:21:26] <awc737> don't use either :/ so far zurb foundation and jquery
[16:21:46] <awc737> zurb foundation has no autocomplete.. but i just found this: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[16:26:09] <sunbeam> I need a way to check whether the browser used is android/iphone (smartphone)
[16:26:11] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[16:35:15] <sayd> hi, i'm using drupal (sux, i know) and I want to use jquery greater than 1.4.4 which is what comes with drupal. i add it, but im noticing some custom events aren't firing. i think its possible that they were triggered with a 1.4.4 $ context but im using 1.7.1 in my on() call. would this cause on() to never catch those events?
[16:42:11] <Cronoh> Hi, I am using $('input[id*="_fee_"]') selector to find inputs where the id is like: details_0_fee_postage , details_0_fee_mvd, details_0_fee_dts, details_1_fee_postage, etc, what is the best way to retrieve the number it is on (the 0, 1, etc) so i can select other fields from the same row
[16:42:34] <Cronoh> i also have the fields available with name="details[0][fee_mvd]" etc
[16:52:06] <AlbinoGeek> How do I access the data-xyz attributes (HTML5) via jQuery's $(this) ?
[16:52:15] <coldhead> $(this).data('xyz')
[16:52:30] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I'd have figured yet the .data page is ... completely different topic.
[16:52:47] <coldhead> it shouldn't be!
[16:52:51] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: http://api.jquery.com/data/ speaks of filling spans.. nothing to do with attribute data :/  Hence my confusion
[16:53:09] <coldhead> this is worht a read: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[16:54:54] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Interesting, that page seems to just list a bunch of reasons why jQuery is bad at using data-* attributes :/
[16:55:12] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Starting from the first bit where it says "jQuery caches it, so you'll have to use attr() if you update the DOM..."
[16:56:23] <AlbinoGeek> Does jQuery just not fully support data-* attributes yet?
[16:57:24] <coldhead> it does
[16:57:38] <coldhead> there's... not much to support
[16:57:51] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Okay, so "limited support" would be correct to say?
[16:58:05] <coldhead> <span data-foo="aids"> | $('span').data('foo') === "aids"
[16:58:11] <KWhat_Work> how are you suppose to deal with optional arguments without writing 5000 lines of if handlers? If i have 2 arguments that are optional of similar type, how do you know if it was passed?
[16:58:19] <coldhead> every aspect i am aware of is supported, AlbinoGeek. what are you missing?
[16:59:05] <coldhead> KWhat_Work: if (! arg1) arg1 = 'some default';
[16:59:19] <coldhead> KWhat_Work: if (! arg2) arg2 = 'some other default';
[16:59:36] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: A) jQuery can't update/edit data-* attributes.  B) Reading the data-* attributes of newly-created (even jQuery created) elements always returned undefined.  C) jQuery will always return the FIRST read value, and never read new values using the data api.
[16:59:49] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Etc, all problems addressed in the link you showed me.
[17:00:49] <xorn> http://tinyurl.com/d374ask why is my second div not draggable and slideToggle ready?
[17:01:11] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: There is no means of cleaing jQuery's cache of a data-* value either.  Nor does jQuery's cache automatically clear for elements that are destroyed or removed from the DOM.
[17:01:29] <coldhead> oh right
[17:01:35] <coldhead> those things aren't supported then, i guess
[17:02:01] <coldhead> my attitude has been rather to read that post and then fit my demands to what jQUery provides
[17:02:16] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: if you prefer you can use .attr('data-xyz')
[17:02:22] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Yeah, so seems I'll be using hacky .attr() for now.
[17:02:39] <coldhead> i'm sorry jQuery isn't better for you
[17:02:50] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Hacky because using .attr() to SET a data-* attribute does not notify any other things (such as HTML5 data-storage) that the attributes have changed.
[17:02:57] <coldhead> if you want to fork on github and improve it i'm sure that would be welcome :D
[17:03:02] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I'm not complaining, simply voicing issues that a developer might pick up on or make say regarding.
[17:03:14] <coldhead> right, and i guess that's why dave wrote his post
[17:03:19] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Yup :)
[17:03:20] <coldhead> to spell it all out
[17:03:35] <coldhead> i will be less glib about insisting full support now
[17:03:40] <coldhead> i didn't appreciate all the nuances
[17:03:55] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know a good library for animating drop down menus?
[17:04:11] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: Yeah... jQuery.animate() is fine.
[17:04:23] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:04:26] <DeltaHeavy> AlbinoGeek: I know how to use that but I'm talking specifically for drop down menus
[17:04:35] <xorn> help me too pls :)
[17:04:43] <DeltaHeavy> I can make it, but cross browser my HTML/CSS breaks
[17:04:43] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: I simply use .animate with "pulldown" and a timed fade, it looks great.
[17:04:57] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: And since I use bootstrap, I don't have any browser problems :)
[17:05:14] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: See: http://96.55.116.148:1337/manager/ ("Theme" menu)
[17:05:40] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I think I'll just look at thie HTML/CSS and duplicate it in mine
[17:06:51] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: Yeah, you should consider checking out bootstrap, it's a nice CSS prototyping / boilerplate codebase.
[17:07:03] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: And yeah, dark theme :D
[17:09:03] <AlbinoGeek> Hmm, can jQuery access the parent elements ciclically?
[17:09:05] <AlbinoGeek> cyclically *
[17:09:23] <AlbinoGeek> ie: $(this).parent.parent.hide(500); ?
[17:09:39] <xorn> http://tinyurl.com/d374ask why is my second div not draggable and slideToggle ready?
[17:09:41] <AlbinoGeek> I'm seeing parent() but yeah.
[17:10:03] <coldhead> closest() is neater
[17:10:17] <coldhead> if you can find a selector for the grandparent
[17:10:21] <coldhead> ?closest
[17:10:22] <bot-t1> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[17:12:11] <DeltaHeavy> AlbionoGeek: I'm learning it ASAP. Need to push what I have on my plate out the door first
[17:12:33] <DeltaHeavy> AlbinoGeek: What I'm working on now I need to grab images out of PSDs and stuff like that so I c an't really use bootstrap for it anyway, at least I think
[17:12:58] <AlbinoGeek> DeltaHeavy: Heh... good luck with that one.
[17:15:42] <DeltaHeavy> AlbinoGeek: Thanks
[17:16:15] <AlbinoGeek> Garbee: Hey there!  Hmm, it would seem that noty is refusing to work.

[18:33:22] <php10> that just searches and paginates static content
[18:34:37] <dblosevn> php10: not sure how static that content is, it consumes an ajax service to get the next page
[18:35:24] <php10> i just want to have like an html <ul> containing items layed out like that proactive site and then have a jquery system that will search and paginate it
[18:36:26] <php10> basically a client side search/paginate
[18:36:52] <dblosevn> ya, that can be done, thats not how the example you showed us works however
[18:37:30] <php10> i know, i'm just saying that's how i want it to *look* :)
[18:37:50] <dblosevn> make a wrapper div with a fixed height
[18:37:58] <dblosevn> overflow:hidden
[18:38:29] <dblosevn> then scroll your div + height on each next button press
[18:38:39] <dblosevn> be the easiestway to do it
[18:39:16] <php10> but if i want to tie in a search type thing then i might as well store it all in an array or something
[18:39:18] <dblosevn> dont animate the scroll and it will apear to change pages instead of scrolling
[18:39:30] <php10> i figured something would already be made for this :P

[19:07:57] <coldhead> yeah animate the height i think
[19:08:16] <deweydb> thanks
[19:15:00] <raj> hey coldhead, have you ever played with angular.js?
[19:15:22] <coldhead> no i haven't
[19:16:03] <coldhead> i would check this out if i was going to http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/architecture-examples/angularjs/#/
[19:19:11] <raj> that's cool
[19:19:45] <raj> well, i was just wondering how much of my current code would have to change if I start using angular.js
[19:21:24] <coldhead> unless your code is already structured MVC-wise i think it would be impossible to retrofit
[19:21:35] <coldhead> i'd start over from scratch and copy across function by function
[19:21:46] <raj> holy crap
[19:22:01] <raj> well, I'm using jquery everywhere
[19:22:15] <raj> wait, angular.js isn't a backend, right?
[19:22:24] <raj> cuz I'm using a python framework serverside
[19:22:25] <coldhead> it's a framework
[19:22:32] <coldhead> to structure your clientside code
[19:22:42] <raj> ok
[19:22:46] <coldhead> have a look at addy's TODO implementation
[19:22:52] <raj> not sure why clientside needs a model
[19:22:55] <coldhead> and compare the way that code is structured to the way yours is now
[19:23:04] <coldhead> you don't NEED it
[19:23:07] <raj> I don't understand what's going on in his code
[19:23:13] <coldhead> it's just nice to have if you like that kind of thing
[19:23:26] <raj> I do, I'm using an MVC framework serverside
[19:23:38] <raj> just not sure how it would be used clientside
[19:23:49] <coldhead> i used an MVC here https://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin
[19:23:54] <raj> i see the example, but I don't really understand what's going on with his globals
[19:24:56] <coldhead> raj: maybe read his https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals
[19:25:00] <raj> so backbone is similar, I take it
[19:25:06] <coldhead> which explains the theory behind it more
[19:25:12] <coldhead> yes, same basic idea
[19:25:44] <coldhead> i used it for the latin thing because it made sense to me to have a model and a view and a collection and a controller
[19:25:50] <coldhead> but it didn't change my life
[19:25:55] <coldhead> it's good for "web apps"
[19:26:01] <raj> not sure where to go in this last link
[19:26:14] <raj> whatever that means
[19:26:16] <raj> :)
[19:26:22] <coldhead> sorry http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/
[19:26:22] <raj> "web apps"
[19:26:36] <coldhead> the first two chapters are of interest
[19:26:54] <raj> very nice
[19:26:58] <raj> all of this will apply to angular.js?
[19:27:00] <coldhead> web app as in an entire application available over the web. rather than a bunch of jQuery attached to a bunch of html on a site
[19:27:05] <coldhead> the first two chapters wil
[19:27:06] <coldhead> l
[19:27:10] <coldhead> the internals are different
[19:27:13] <coldhead> but the Why is the same
[19:28:05] <raj> ok, I'm like this narrative very much already, thank you! :)
[19:30:09] <raj> coldhead, so this is one of those things that people in #html would have a hissy-fit about?
[19:30:29] <coldhead> probably
[19:30:46] <raj> well, not like my site works usefully without js anyway
[19:30:47] <coldhead> but you can get them to have a hissy fit by prefering regular milk to soy in your coffee
[19:30:55] <raj> lmao
[19:32:15] <raj> this is crazy, I'd have to redo EVERYTHING i've built to use this
[19:32:26] <raj> cuz I'm using an html templating language too
[19:32:33] <coldhead> use it for your next project then
[19:32:39] <coldhead> that's what i did with the latin thing
[19:32:43] <coldhead> and i haven't used it again
[19:32:48] <coldhead> but i can brag about how i know it
[19:32:55] <raj> ok, so it didn't seem 'super' awesome
[19:33:00] <raj> haha, true
[19:33:32] <raj> someone suggested this because I was considering using jquery's .load()
[19:33:37] <raj> so that i didn't need page refreshes
[19:33:49] <raj> but this would be a complete gutting of my code
[19:34:01] <coldhead> not worth it just to use an MVC's internal load
[19:34:05] <raj> because .load() didn't manage the back button
[19:34:16] <coldhead> its definitely something you want in the project from the start
[19:34:19] <raj> so I'd need to do stuff with history.js as well
[19:34:22] <coldhead> not something you can patch in later
[19:34:27] <raj> right, k
[19:35:47] <raj> so does .load() along with history.js seem unreasonable?
[19:35:56] <raj> or is there a better alternative at this time?
[19:36:11] <coldhead> i work with people who mash those two things together all the time
[19:36:16] <coldhead> its fine
[19:36:19] <raj> k cool
[19:36:28] <raj> as long as I won't be way over my head
[19:36:31] <coldhead> once you get to grips with history.js so you know what you're doing that should be very easy and natural
[19:36:44] <coldhead> you're much more likely to be in over your head with an MVC
[19:36:50] <raj> I was actually good at it before
[19:37:04] <raj> but I've stepped away from my code for such a long time I've forgotten how to use that module
[19:37:22] <raj> k, thanks for the talk coldhead
[19:38:10] <coldhead> sure thing! good luck
[19:47:20] <lontrax> please, this is the best way to make slide down with toggle?  http://jsbin.com/avujux/1/edit
[20:14:28] <HyShai__> shoky: sorry about that I missed your response
[20:18:39] <HyShai__> shoky: why doesn't regualr css notation work properly for margin-top?
[20:19:20] <HyShai__> shoky: btw your solution worked great!
[20:20:01] <HyShai__> sbugzu_: sorry i missed your response....
[20:20:31] <HyShai__> thanks, but shoky gave me a solution already :)
[20:25:18] <dblosevn> hey, quick question, http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true how can I get thoughs tables next to each other and maintain position:fixed so the right table scrolls with the page
[20:26:49] <dblosevn> the only way I could figure out how to get them from being on top of each other was putting the right table right:30px; when I floated them both left I liked how it looked until I changed the right table to position: fixed;
[20:27:11] <raj> can I save a .loaded() url so I can modify it before inserting it?
[20:30:36] <raj> nm
[20:33:31] <dblosevn> :-( o well gotta go home early morning tomorrow maybe ill figure it out by then
[20:34:21] <raj> dblosevn, check #css I think
[20:34:48] <dblosevn> ya, I was already here, didnt feel like changing channels lol
[20:35:23] <dblosevn> and I know its something small I am missing
[20:40:53] <raj> why isn't stuff in the page's header run when you .load() a url?
[20:43:28] <raj> I mean the stuff in btwn <head></head>
[20:44:33] <HyShai__> shoky: why doesnt "margin-top: 20px" work?
[20:51:51] <raj> is there a $.getScript() alternative for css?
[21:05:36] <raj> this room is really boring without people
[21:06:04] <raj> the joins and parts just aren't doing it fo rme like usual
[21:08:28] <coldhead> no there isn't, raj
[21:08:34] <coldhead> you could write your own pretty easy
[21:08:59] <coldhead> it's just a $('<link>', {some: props}).appendTo('head')
[21:09:10] <raj> yeah, I found http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-getscript-12-1-2010
[21:09:25] <raj> about to try it out
[21:20:32] <AlbinoGeek> Hey there!  I have two elements (spl_data and spl_image) in which I want to animate one after the other, not non-blocking synchronously as jQuery seems to by default.
[21:20:55] <AlbinoGeek> I figured the approach would be .queue(), but upon reading up on this I found it only applied to a single element.
[21:22:32] <ProLoser|Work> anyone ever use tinymce?
[21:22:38] <AlbinoGeek> I'm also seeing you can use .animeate()'s onComplete callback; but this would be extremely messy since I am hiding three elements and showing one based on the selection of a dropdwon.
[21:22:51] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to figure out how to programmatically set the editor's value
[21:22:55] <derekpioneer_> i'm trying to hover over a link, have a div (not its child) dropdown
[21:23:06] <derekpioneer_> and then leave that div dropped down until the mouse leaves the hovered element or that div
[21:23:17] <derekpioneer_> but using a standard link.hover(
[21:23:24] <derekpioneer_> the div disappears when the mouse hovers over the div that i appear
[21:23:30] <derekpioneer_> http://dev.tsecashmerehouse.com/collections/women-pre-fall-2012.html
[21:23:32] <AlbinoGeek> derekpioneer: Use $('.mylink').mouseover and $('.mylink').mouseout.
[21:23:33] <derekpioneer_> hover over share
[21:23:34] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent(s);
[21:23:46] <coldhead> never used it but i jacked that from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8576078/set-value-inside-a-tinymce-editor-using-jquery
[21:24:01] <AlbinoGeek> derekpioneer_: Hover won't work simply because it won't count the dropdown as a hover target.
[21:24:24] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: i would just use the callback
[21:24:31] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Re: My problem?
[21:24:39] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[21:24:41] <coldhead> yeah
[21:24:46] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I'd have to have four callback functions per each of my four calls to animate..
[21:24:50] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: It'd be a bloody mess.
[21:24:58] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: and what if there are multiple editors?
[21:25:04] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know how it decides which one is 'active'
[21:25:12] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Oh, thanks; the page you linked showed fixes.
[21:25:17] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: i don't know either, i just copy pasted
[21:25:39] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: you should be able to get inspiration there for a not too messy way
[21:25:44] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: The easiest way is to keep track of the active editor using the onActive callback from TinyMCE; then saving the active editor's selector in a variable for use elsewhere.
[21:25:46] <coldhead> good luck!
[21:26:13] <ProLoser|Work> AlbinoGeek: this is programmatic
[21:26:19] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: Sorry, onFocus
[21:26:20] <ProLoser|Work> a completely unrelated widget on the page is changing an editors value
[21:26:28] <coldhead> gross
[21:26:30] <ProLoser|Work> it makes 0 sense to micromanage what the user is focusing on
[21:26:31] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: Yes, but why do you have multiple editors?
[21:26:41] <ProLoser|Work> it's a complex form, it should not be relevant
[21:26:45] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: You said you want to change the ACTIVE (focused) editor's text.
[21:26:48] <ProLoser|Work> no
[21:26:53] <ProLoser|Work> i want to change an editors text
[21:26:56] <ProLoser|Work> i did not say it was active
[21:27:01] <AlbinoGeek> [21:24:56] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: and what if there are multiple editors?
[21:27:01] <AlbinoGeek> [21:25:01] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know how it decides which one is 'active'
[21:27:15] <ProLoser|Work> i would like to be able to do something like $('#sometextarea').tinymce('val', someVal)
[21:27:20] <ProLoser|Work> i should not have ot keep track of crap
[21:27:32] <ProLoser|Work> AlbinoGeek: not sure what you're getting at
[21:27:39] <derekpioneer_> AlbinoGeek, i realize that hover doesn't work because it doesn't count the dropdown as hover target
[21:27:41] <ProLoser|Work> the definition of 'active' is moot to me since i'm doing this programmatically
[21:27:42] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: I answered your question as you asked it :/
[21:27:45] <derekpioneer_> how does mouseover, mouseout help that?
[21:27:52] <ProLoser|Work> i did not ask that
[21:27:53] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: You're the one that said "active" and asked for "active".
[21:27:59] <ProLoser|Work> omg
[21:28:01] <AlbinoGeek> I just copied your own damned text, scroll up.
[21:28:05] <ProLoser|Work> dude
[21:28:08] <ProLoser|Work> nvm
[21:28:09] <coldhead> now now
[21:28:10] <ProLoser|Work> it's a moot point
[21:28:17] <coldhead> lol moot
[21:28:21] <coldhead> moot is a funny word
[21:28:23] <ProLoser|Work> mute*?
[21:28:26] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know/care
[21:28:27] <ProLoser|Work> anyway
[21:28:30] <coldhead> let's all just listen to bjork
[21:28:36] <ProLoser|Work> i need to select a specific textarea
[21:28:39] <ProLoser|Work> and update it
[21:28:39] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: TinyMCE deems what the active editor is based on the last editor that was used, (keyup,mouseup).
[21:28:41] <coldhead> moot was right, ProLoser|Work
[21:28:48] <coldhead> ?w moot
[21:28:48] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: Using tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent(s); will set the content of that editor.,
[21:28:50] <bot-t1> coldhead, Moot court - A moot court is an extracurricular activity at many law schools in which participants take part in simulated court proceedings, which usually involves drafting briefs (or memorials) and participating in oral argument. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moot_court
[21:29:03] <coldhead> er thanks bot-t1
[21:29:11] <ProLoser|Work> AlbinoGeek: i never said "active", i was replying to the code pasted which uses "lastActive"
[21:29:18] <ProLoser|Work> i also don't expect users to focus any of the inputs
[21:29:37] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: $('.myEditor').setContent(s); ...
[21:29:37] <ProLoser|Work> they can click a button and arbitrarily update the middle input
[21:29:47] <ProLoser|Work> it adds it to t $.fn?
[21:29:51] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: Or better yet, $('.myTextArea').val(xyz);
[21:29:58] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: i think last time i had to so something like that i removed the editor, inserted a new <textarea>, pre-filled it and created a new editor around it
[21:30:01] <ProLoser|Work> .val() does not update the textarea i think
[21:30:02] <coldhead> this was back in the mid 80s
[21:30:04] <coldhead> but still...
[21:30:20] <ProLoser|Work> fucking hating tinymce these days...
[21:30:25] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: It doesn't?  I figured val() was for any input, if not you can use html().
[21:30:30] <coldhead> mmm it's no my favorite
[21:30:34] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: TinyMCE is a load of crap, it's hardly tiny.
[21:30:53] <ProLoser|Work> my issue is that if you make the textarea visible and edit it, the changes are not reflected back to the tinymce
[21:31:03] <ProLoser|Work> which concerns me in the event that i'm not using .val()
[21:31:12] <ProLoser|Work> but it may be the way to go (i guess they hook into val()?)
[21:31:15] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: Here's probably a better question: Does it have to be TinyMCE ?
[21:31:21] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[21:31:26] <ProLoser|Work> we're too far into the project
[21:31:30] <ProLoser|Work> but i'm open to suggestions for the future
[21:31:33] <AlbinoGeek> Then I can't help past the .val() .html() I've said above.
[21:31:55] <AlbinoGeek> I personally use .. let me find the name.
[21:32:18] <AlbinoGeek> ProLoser|Work: nicEdit
[21:33:14] <AlbinoGeek> It's NOT a jQuery plugin, uses bkLib which it includes itself; very light and plays nicely with responsive/jQuery/other libraries.
[21:34:20] <coldhead> i just ask my clients to send me a print out of their text changes and i upload them to the site myself
[21:36:29] <raj> coldhead, can I use .load() with a fade in?
[21:36:43] <raj> something not to tongue-twisting hopefully
[21:36:46] <raj> *too
[21:36:50] <coldhead> sure, why not
[21:37:01] <raj> k, how would I do that?
[21:37:05] <coldhead> put the fadeIn() in the callback to load()
[21:37:10] <coldhead> see the load docs for details
[21:37:13] <coldhead> ?ajax.load
[21:37:15] <bot-t1> coldhead, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:37:33] <coldhead> BABY YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE LOVE
[21:40:30] <raj> coldhead, but isn't it already loaded by the time it does the callback?
[21:40:45] <coldhead> yes?
[21:40:51] <coldhead> that's when it's safe to do the fadeIn()
[21:40:53] <raj> so how can I fade it in?
[21:40:58] <coldhead> otherwise you're fading in something that isn't there
[21:41:01] <raj> I thought it would have already appeared
[21:41:10] <coldhead> not if you display:none the container
[21:41:17] <raj> ok
[21:41:47] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Sadly nothing on that page does what I need it to.
[21:42:21] <coldhead> not even with a cup of coffee and a good think? very clever people worked hard on those solutions
[21:42:24] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I need to hide three elements, then show only the one selected by a dropdown.  Those examples all deal with hiding all elements of a child, and sadly (through testing) the same methods do not apply to both hiding and showing.
[21:42:27] <raj> coldhead, can i load a url onto a variable?
[21:42:37] <raj> so i can play with it in jq?
[21:42:40] <coldhead> with ajax(), raj
[21:42:43] <AlbinoGeek> I should probably just jsbin this.... make everything a lot faster
[21:43:26] <raj> would it be overkill to create a $.load() method that returns the loaded DOM?
[21:43:50] <coldhead> not necessarily
[21:43:56] <raj> is it out of pattern?
[21:43:58] <coldhead> it depends how you do it and what youuse it for
[21:44:08] <coldhead> it depends
[21:44:18] <raj> I just wanna load it onto a variable and then dick around with the dom before inserting it
[21:44:24] <coldhead> if you had it return a jQuery object with the DOM element in it then that's pretty legit
[21:46:31] <derekpioneer_> what is the best way to tackle this hover problem? http://dev.tsecashmerehouse.com/collections/women-pre-fall-2012.html
[21:46:35] <derekpioneer_> i want to hover over a div
[21:46:46] <derekpioneer_> and then have another div be toggled
[21:47:14] <derekpioneer_> and not be untoggled until the mouse leaves the original div or enters the new div and then leaves
[21:47:25] <derekpioneer_> css solutions are welcome as well
[21:47:59] <derekpioneer_> i'm a good jquery programmer and am not sure why this is boggling my mind so much
[21:48:05] <raj> coldhead, http://paste.ofcode.org/CBxq2Rpk95B7NncHK28PvU ?
[21:48:20] <derekpioneer_> (on the link i posted hover over "share")
[21:48:35] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Alright, I've extracted the relevent code and provided an example: http://jsbin.com/ifezig/1
[21:48:41] <raj> i have to make it take the selectors though
[21:48:49] <raj> and then utilize that after I get the data back
[21:49:08] <raj> I guess I should make it take all the arguments
[21:49:17] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: The problem is: They need to hide, and THEN show the next; not where it is right now where the hiding and shwoing is synchronized.
[21:49:25] <raj> although I'm not sure how to implement that complete argument
[21:50:57] <coldhead> only before you i'm humble
[21:53:09] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: this isn't tested and i am high on cold meds but i'd try like this http://jsbin.com/ifezig/2/edit
[21:54:09] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: A lot less errors / broken HTML later: http://jsbin.com/ifezig/3
[21:54:21] <AlbinoGeek> Hmm.. trying
[21:56:11] <coldhead> raj: http://paste.ofcode.org/ngcE2b7ybh6r3TAsUKqzwk
[21:56:11] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Yeah, unfortunately that doesn't work; even the simpler implementation doesn't.
[21:56:24] <coldhead> but do you see the strategy, AlbinoGeek?
[21:56:26] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: It appears that the callback is run instantly if one of the elements can't be hidden (is already hidden.)
[21:56:34] <coldhead> ah fuck
[21:56:35] <coldhead> of course
[21:56:38] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I see the strategy, yeah; but it doesn't work because of the above.
[21:56:39] <AlbinoGeek> :(
[21:56:50] <AlbinoGeek> Which is stupid frankly, but yeah..
[21:56:51] <coldhead> oh that's not too hard to fix!
[21:56:57] <AlbinoGeek> Is there no .delay ?
[21:56:58] <AlbinoGeek> Honestly ?>
[21:57:04] <AlbinoGeek> That would solve everything.
[21:57:14] <coldhead> $('.class1, .class2, .class3').filter(':visible').hide();
[21:57:19] <coldhead> that won't run on hidden elems
[21:57:24] <coldhead> ?delay
[21:57:25] <bot-t1> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:57:33] <coldhead> there is a delay, i just can't ever get it to work
[21:57:39] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Heh
[21:57:41] <coldhead> but your brain might be wired better than mine
[21:57:43] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Alright, testing filter..
[21:57:54] <coldhead> good luck!
[21:57:55] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Won't work, that uses a queue; queue is for one element only.
[21:58:00] <AlbinoGeek> Filter might though...
[21:58:19] <raj> VERY INTERESTING!
[21:58:23] <AlbinoGeek> WOW
[21:58:24] <coldhead> someone like gnarf would know how to hack queue() to support multiple elements
[21:58:32] <coldhead> probably with promises()
[21:58:33] <raj> definitely would not have realized that
[21:58:34] <raj> thank you
[21:58:35] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Works:  $('.spt_data_image, .spt_data_html, .spt_data_URL').filter(':visible').hide(speed, function(){ $('.spt_data_'+type).show(speed); });
[21:58:49] <coldhead> oh happy day
[21:59:03] <coldhead> i'm going to go do some actual work to celebrate then. good luck kids
[21:59:09] <AlbinoGeek> lol
[22:00:10] <raj> so coldhead, basically $myelement=$.load('/someurl #bla', callbackfunc) could never happen
[22:00:16] <coldhead> right
[22:00:18] <raj> because I can't return anything
[22:02:50] <coldhead> there's definitely no logic to human behaviour
[22:04:03] <HyShai__> hey I'm having an issue with the scrolling for the autocomplete plugin
[22:04:08] <HyShai__> http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/
[22:04:22] <HyShai__> this works fine
[22:04:54] <HyShai__> but when i add the scrolling css - my :before and :after css disappears
[22:05:35] <HyShai__> this was the recommended css to allow scrolling on the AC plugin .ui-autocomplete {max-height: 300px;
[22:05:35] <HyShai__> overflow: hidden;}â€‹
[22:06:15] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 300px;
[22:06:31] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Having both X and Y overflow hidden will not produce a scrollbar on some browsers.
[22:07:52] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: I tried that and while I get the scrollbar, for some reason the :before :after pseudo-elements disappear
[22:08:28] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Please define your :before and :after psuedo elements AFTER all of the CSS pertaining to the scrolling and changes; as well as the plugin CSS.
[22:09:00] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Example being just above your </body> tag.  This is the easiest way to debug if it is being overriden by a plugin of jQuery, or some othe rCSS.
[22:09:07] <AlbinoGeek> Also brb
[22:15:39] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: putting the before/after css at the end idn't work. I tried it in http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/1/ and in my website.
[22:15:50] <awc737> anyone use http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ ?
[22:16:09] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__ :: is your problem, it's one : not two.
[22:16:26] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Also consider the alternative syntax &: from inside the parent definition.
[22:16:51] <AlbinoGeek> I'm making a working example now, please give me a moment.
[22:17:02] <Guest33977> I am using Bootstrap tooltip. Currently its working fine. I have to show that tootip even mouseover  of toolip? hwo to do?
[22:18:20] <HyShai__> ok i'm not sure I understand, I'll wait to see your example
[22:18:49] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Also, why are you defining them on ui-menu, what do they do?  (I am unable to see what they do if even applied to a simple div.)
[22:19:57] <HyShai__> If you take out the overflow css on the top it shows a little arrow for the dropdown like this http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/2/
[22:20:19] <raj> instead of loading each javascript file from the <head> of a page one by one using .getScript(), is there something that will load all js files in that <head> ?
[22:20:31] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek:  If you take out the overflow css on the top it shows a little arrow for the dropdown like this http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/2/
[22:21:07] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: the AC widget has a bunch of classes for the container - I just randomly picked 1
[22:22:40] <galymzhan> is "jQuery(function($) { ... });"  equivalent to "jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... } );" ?
[22:22:47] <faraway> raj: well there tools that combine your different script into one file
[22:23:04] <raj> right, that's eventually
[22:23:13] <raj> but i'd like something to load them each right now
[22:23:26] <faraway> raj: probably you should look at amd
[22:23:26] <coldhead> it is, galymzhan
[22:23:27] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: I just don't understand what your before and after code is meant to do, it's a bunch of transparent definitions.
[22:23:34] <coldhead> but prefer the latter form, always
[22:24:21] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: I don't really understand it either - I stole it form Bootstrap, but visually it adds that little arrow
[22:24:25] <galymzhan> coldhead: $ will be jQuery object, meaning we don't have problems with other libraries using $ as well, right?
[22:25:15] <raj> not sure how amd does what I'm looking to do
[22:25:35] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: I don't actually see an arrow anywhere, even when applied to just a div.
[22:25:39] <raj> I'm just trying to use the html in the <head> section to figure out what js files need to be loaded
[22:25:44] <raj> and then load them
[22:26:35] <coldhead> galymzhan: yes
[22:26:44] <coldhead> a safe local reference to it :)
[22:26:48] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: did you check http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/2/ ? When you use the input, on the top left of the dropdown there's a little arrow/"nipple"
[22:27:02] <raj> coldhead, any thoughts?
[22:27:04] <galymzhan> coldhead: thanks a lot!
[22:27:35] <coldhead> raj: AMD or yepnope
[22:28:03] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Definitely works... http://jsfiddle.net/79T7P/3/
[22:28:21] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: I put a giant red border to see the before and after working, and they work in that example; but I see no arrow or anything.
[22:29:05] <raj> those both load js files
[22:29:08] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Are you trying to emulate the "thought bubble" effect that has the dropdown showing as conected to the field?
[22:29:11] <raj> by referencing the js file
[22:29:20] <raj> I want to load js files by referencing an html file
[22:29:23] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: As seen here: http://i.imgur.com/HsUT2.png
[22:30:15] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: If so, the CSS you are using is what the problem is.  Bootstrap has updated the menu-connector CSS vastly since your sample by the looks of it.
[22:30:27] <faraway> raj: well then you need to be a little bit more clear what you want to do :D
[22:30:39] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Yup thats what I'm trying to do....and it works before I added overflow
[22:30:40] <raj> you're right =T my bad
[22:30:54] <coldhead> word
[22:31:14] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Really? I took it straight from their website....
[22:31:33] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Yeah, I'm not seeing that CSS in my current bootstrap project.. :/
[22:31:58] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Hmm lemme check mine
[22:32:06] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: The current bootstrap CSS regarding dropdown-menu is: http://hastebin.com/jininivapu.css
[22:32:53] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: The full CSS is: http://hastebin.com/hexerefabu.css
[22:35:15] <raj> ok, so for my updated question? will I have to scower the <head> section myself using jq, and dissecting the script urls?
[22:35:55] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: So how do you think their doing that bubble thing?
[22:36:25] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: And also why doesn't the old one work with overflow?
[22:36:36] <HyShai__> *they're
[22:36:43] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: I have no idea why the old one even works, let alone why it doesn't work with overflow.
[22:36:58] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: As to actually copying that; I'd just use a border-image.. but that's just me; it's so much simpler.
[22:37:38] <AlbinoGeek> border-top-image: url('nib.png') top right no-repeat;
[22:37:53] <AlbinoGeek> without the "top" bit in the value actually.
[22:38:37] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Yup they actually are doing something similar on twitter.com
[22:38:56] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Though they add an extra div and use this css http://hastebin.com/mavacibeti.css
[22:39:06] <faraway> raj: still not sure what you want to do, what informations from the head do you use to load scripts, and why can't you load these scripts directly via a script tag?
[22:39:47] <HyShai__> AlbinoGeek: Thank you for all your help :)
[22:40:18] <AlbinoGeek> HyShai__: Yw
[22:46:32] <raj> faraway, I'm loading a page using $('#someelement').load('/someurl #content')
[22:47:08] <raj> along with that I'd like to load the .js files that are loaded in the head of the html file that someurl points to
[22:47:51] <faraway> raj: ah ok
[22:49:09] <raj> maybe name it $.loadHead()
[22:49:50] <faraway> raj: well there are different approaches .. but that really depends on how you structure your page.
[22:50:17] <raj> everything I need to load is in the head, I just wanna load it :)
[22:50:38] <raj> it's a buncha css files grouped together and a buncha js files
[22:51:01] <raj> in fact, if I can unload other resources, that'd be even cooler
[22:51:11] <raj> so I can switch to groups of resources
[22:51:29] <raj> and please don't mention requireJS :)
[22:53:43] <faraway> raj: well first of all most of the time it is not required that you have different css files for your whole webpage ... use e.g. sass + compass to organize you css files and combine it in one that is send gzip form your server. so you should probably check if this is possible
[22:54:02] <faraway> raj: you cant unload styles, but you can deactivate them
[22:54:16] <raj> how do you deactivate?
[22:54:53] <faraway> raj: e.g. document.styleSheets[0].disabled = true
[22:55:54] <Lucky--> how to piss off your user base http://pastebin.com/hF6QZrs6 persistent connections that simply wont go away regardless of clearing browser.
[22:55:56] <faraway> raj: there are some pitfalls ... i currently don't have the list here right now.
[22:55:58] <raj> interesting
[22:56:20] <raj> so you recommend sending all my css files all at once in a combined .css file
[22:56:41] <raj> I currently only load certain css files (via my templating language) depending on the current url
[22:57:39] <faraway> raj: i would suggest ... cause if they are not to big (what i guess) it is a better browsing experience. and you don't have the problems with loading them
[22:58:12] <Shai_Tan> I am posting a form which does an ajax call for some validation. On success I want to submit the form without page refresh and show a message. I use e.preventDefault() to stop the form submitting, but then cannot get the form to submit. How do I get the form to submit after using e.preventDefault() without page refresh?
[22:58:21] <raj> ok
[22:58:26] <raj> same with js?
[22:58:34] <raj> or load js separately for each page?
[22:58:41] <faraway> raj: with scripts it is a little bit tricky
[22:58:56] <raj> right, because there are libraries in some pages
[23:00:50] <raj> at least temporarily I would like to load each js/css file contained in the head of a url
[23:00:52] <faraway> raj: i myself do the following .. loading the mains cripts that are used on all pages (or most of them) as a combined one optimized e.g. with mininimize or closures compiler ... for the rest of the scripts i have "markes" in the html code like data-script-contoller="what.event.controler"  for this attr i sreach in the new loaded html. check if this is loaded ... if not i load this controller which loads everything it needs and then pass the ob
[23:00:52] <faraway> to the controller.
[23:01:21] <faraway> raj: but this definitely depends on the kind of website/webapp you create.
[23:01:45] <raj> wow, very interesting
[23:01:58] <raj> I don't think I can go back and implement that now though
[23:02:04] <raj> I'd have to think that through as I coded it
[23:02:13] <faraway> raj: this was just a draft description of what i'm doing ... i have a lager toolchain that does a pre analysis to do balancing betwenn fast loading and less load on demand
[23:02:43] <raj> wow
[23:03:18] <raj> so I guess I'm going to search all the link and script tags for their desired file
[23:03:21] <raj> and then load them
[23:03:34] <raj> since I'm not looking to combine all my files as of yet
[23:04:07] <faraway> raj: if you load scripts you always keep in mind that if you load the content a second time that your "initializer" for that pag is called correctly and that you don't accidently "initlaize" elements twice
[23:04:37] <raj> oh, hmm
[23:04:53] <raj> ok, well, I'll have to make sure my code is clean then
[23:05:02] <raj> but even still, I'm in no position to be combining all my js and css codes
[23:05:06] <raj> I'll save that for production
[23:05:18] <faraway> raj: thats why i recommend amd like loaders.
[23:05:37] <raj> because they compile it for me?
[23:06:56] <faraway> raj: amd is just a definition for "define" and "require" ... libs like requiredjs implements these ... how they achieve these depends on the library
[23:08:16] <raj> k
[23:08:19] <raj> thanks
[23:08:22] <faraway> raj: but keeping these informations i told you i mind, you should so some further reading yourself. even if you can't apply it to your work anymore right now
[23:08:56] <raj> absolutely
[23:09:03] <raj> that's what I'm doing :)
[23:11:06] <Jimu_> i've got a fullscreen app that i want a pause button to drop down from the top when the mouse is near the top of the screen. I've got an implementation where there's a div set mostly off the top, and when mouseover it moves down, but i get this annoying bounce if the mouse leaves the div during the animation down
[23:11:25] <raj> why can't I find the script tag as a selector?
[23:14:59] <AlbinoGeek> If I delete a field from the DOM during .submit() will it be removed from the content to be submitted as well?
[23:15:43] <raj> wow, there isn't even a way to get the script tag
[23:16:30] <faraway> raj: i'n not sure about the .load command .. i think it removed the script tags so that they are not executed
[23:16:50] <raj> even still, I need css's link tags too
[23:17:04] <raj> neither are picked up using $('script') or $('link')
[23:17:18] <raj> so how can I retrieve it?
[23:18:06] <faraway> sorry i can't help you with the .load command cause i never really used it.
[23:18:35] <raj> I'm not using .load
[23:18:39] <raj> i'm using $.ajax
[23:19:12] <raj> I just wanna examine the success data for its <script> and <link> tags
[23:19:58] <Shai_Tan> I use e.preventDefault() to prevent a form from submitting, and then user .submit() when I wish to submit(), but the form does not submit. How do I make it submit without page refresh?
[23:20:09] <faraway> raj: sorry .. cant help you further i'm in a meeting now
[23:20:16] <raj> k
[23:20:26] <raj> thanks for the talk
[23:27:51] <awc737> is it possible to set an icon font in css background:
[23:48:19] <Cork> awc737: no
[23:48:47] <Cork> awc737: you could rasterize it in a canvas and use the data uri
[23:48:55] <Cork> but not straight of
[23:49:08] <Cork> awc737: another option would be to use the font in an svg file
