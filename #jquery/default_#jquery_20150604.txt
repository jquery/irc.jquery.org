[01:31:12] <RobbyBobby> Randy Llanes, 47, was killed Friday while trying to catch the swordfish with a spear gun, according to the Hawaii Police Department.
[01:31:13] <arup_r> where is mod :/
[01:31:15] <arup_r> ?
[01:31:16] <RobbyBobby> Llanes, who runs a deep sea fishing charter, jumped in the water at Honokohau Harbor on the Big Island after spotting the broadbill swordfish.
[01:31:20] <RobbyBobby> After being hit with the spear that Llanes fired off, the fish "thrashed about, leaving a puncture wound to his upper chest," said Lt. William Souther.
[01:31:24] <RobbyBobby> Another official, acting Sgt. David Matsushima of the Kona Patrol, told KHON that "the fish got wrapped around a mooring anchor, came back and swam at him."
[01:31:24] <Cork> arup_r: just leave it be
[01:31:27] <RobbyBobby> Emergency crews attempted CPR, but Llanes died at a hospital from trauma caused by a puncture wound from the swordfish.
[01:31:31] <RobbyBobby> The fish was about 6 feet long, half of which was its bill, and weighed about 40 pounds.
[01:31:35] <RobbyBobby> Hawaii is a major source of the domestic swordfish catch in the United States, according to a seafood industry website.
[01:31:39] <RobbyBobby> The swordfish is considered swift and ferocious, with a reputation of using its long, distinctive bills to slash prey.

[01:31:46] <RobbyBobby> Ancient Hawaii residents feared the swordfish because they attacked and sometimes pierced fishing canoes.
[01:31:50] <RobbyBobby> Llanes was remembered by friends and family as an experienced fisherman.

But that's obviously not working, since ID would return the field key name ID.

[04:52:12] <beejoomboom> Hi. I am trying to get the index of a row in a table with id="my_id". how can I do that?
[04:52:35] <beejoomboom> (My goal is to append a new row after it)
[04:53:00] <Xatenev> beejoomboom: var rowInde = $(this).closest('tr').prevAll().length;
[04:53:04] <Xatenev> probably something like that
[04:53:18] <Xatenev> so u get the closest tr parent element, find all trs before that and count all of them
[04:53:26] <Xatenev> then u got ur index at the current row position
[04:53:33] <Xatenev> $(this) would be the element with id="my_id" in this case
[04:54:27] <beejoomboom> Cool, trying it out now
[04:54:35] <beejoomboom> Thanks
[04:54:41] <Xatenev> hf nps
[04:59:13] <beejoomboom> It worked. Xatenev you are the man

[05:17:36] <DietDrK> Can I get some hate for: http://jsfiddle.net/kc9Lbjo7/ ?
[05:19:15] <DietDrK> or constructive criticism
[05:19:36] <randomguy1> what's your question?
[05:19:57] <DietDrK> Can I get some hate or constructive criticism for: http://jsfiddle.net/kc9Lbjo7/ ?
[05:20:27] <randomguy1> right, but, narrow it down.  critique about anything specifically?
[05:20:56] <DietDrK> I'm wondering if I'm doing anything majorly wrong in general. Earlier I found out .hover() is bad and I fixed that
[05:21:23] <DietDrK> I have like... 8 days of JS under my belt, and I'm thinking there's probably something better than my .each() in there
[05:21:31] <randomguy1> mmm, well, one thing your doing a lot of redundant wrappers.
[05:21:47] <randomguy1> for instance $('g')
[05:21:56] <randomguy1> you can store that in a variable and reuse it
[05:22:29] <DietDrK> store an array of the elements instead of selecting?
[05:22:55] <randomguy1> and if that variable is "$g" then the other lines, $('g[From="' + NodeID + '"]') , could filter on that variable with $g.filter('[From="'+ NodeID +'"]')
[05:23:02] <randomguy1> one sec
[05:23:08] <DietDrK> very interesting.
[05:23:47] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/kc9Lbjo7/2/ look at NodeHover
[05:24:10] <randomguy1> actually your doing that filter multiple times too... so
[05:24:43] <DietDrK> Your way is cheaper?
[05:24:48] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/kc9Lbjo7/3/
[05:24:56] <randomguy1> less processing, yes
[05:25:11] <DietDrK> Is there a way of benchmarking it?
[05:25:17] <DietDrK> I do intend to add things that are more intensive later
[05:25:36] <randomguy1> you can use chromes profiler or something like that most likely.
[05:25:51] <randomguy1> typically you don't try to optimize javascript until you have a problem
[05:26:17] <DietDrK> I'm worried about the .each() part since I do have graphs with 3k nodes
[05:26:28] <DietDrK> and selectors in general
[05:27:07] <randomguy1> worry about that when you see an issue
[05:27:30] <randomguy1> as far as the each() is concerned
[05:27:50] <gregf_> hi, sorry for interrupting :/
[05:28:16] <randomguy1> but as a general practice, if your doing the same selector multiple times, store it and reuse it
[05:28:35] <DietDrK> I'm looking at the profiler now
[05:28:54] <DietDrK> I guess this is why I don't want to use .min.js files, I want to use the whole thing so I can see which functions are costing me 100s of ms?
[05:29:09] <gregf_> i open a modal window with a file element in it, where i make an ajax request. i wanted to know if the window can be closed after the ajax request succeeded. is this possible please?
[05:30:04] <DietDrK> It looks like everything is just using 10s of ms except for appending the entire SVG graph
[05:30:15] <randomguy1> gregf_: a modal window?  an actual modal or a window.open() window?
[05:30:53] <gregf_> randomguy1: well, something like this: $modal = $('<div><div>').html('<input type="file" onchange="make_ajax()"/>'); $modal.dialog('open');
[05:30:56] <randomguy1> DietDrK: is the appending of the graph in that fiddle you showed me?
[05:31:04] <DietDrK> randomguy1: no
[05:31:12] <DietDrK> it's AJAX on the main site
[05:31:12] <randomguy1> gregf_: oh, sure, i believe .dialog('close') is an option
[05:31:36] <DietDrK> all of the heavy things are in jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js or jquery-2.1.4.min.js
[05:31:37] <gregf_> randomguy1: but i need a refence to the modal window :/
[05:32:09] <randomguy1> then put an id or a class on it that you can lookup, or store the $modal in localStorage or some where else global that you can reference later
[05:32:27] <DietDrK> thanks for the Chrome profiler tool tip
[05:32:33] <DietDrK> put my mind at ease, even if I don't know what's going on
[05:33:00] <gregf_> randomguy1: after make_ajax() succeeds, i need to do $modal.dialog('close'); but i dont have a reference to $modal :/
[05:33:53] <gregf_> ah - ok; so $('<div id="foo"></div>).html(<file_and_ajax_code>).dialog('open'); then how do i refer to foo?
[05:34:11] <randomguy1> select it like normal at that point
[05:34:22] <randomguy1> $('#foo')
[05:34:45] <randomguy1> '#' for ids, '.' for classes
[05:34:52] <gregf_> yeah. but does that give me the modal window reference? and do i then just do $('#foo').close()?
[05:35:26] <gregf_> randomguy1: i know :)... just that this modal window bit is new to me :/
[05:36:06] <randomguy1> gregf_: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ details the close functionality
[05:36:22] <randomguy1> i need to learn the bot commands for jquery stuff...
[05:36:33] <randomguy1> !commands
[05:36:33] <b-ot> randomguy1: http://bot-t.com/docs/
[05:37:23] <gregf_> randomguy1: true, thanks for that. but i need to have a similar code like in buttons : $(this).dialog('close')
[05:37:59] <gregf_> $(this) refers to the dialog i open, and the  html is dynamic :/
[05:38:43] <randomguy1> $(this) is a selector, which just so happens to be an object reference already, so $(this) turns the object into a jquery object
[05:38:59] <randomguy1> $('#foo') will also return a jquery object, but by finding it
[05:39:38] <gregf_> randomguy1: ok. so like as in above, $(this).dialog('close'); so in my case: $('#foo').dialog('close')?
[05:40:11] <gregf_> randomguy1: sorry, i do pretty little Frontend stuff :/.. more backend :/
[05:40:12] <randomguy1> yep, .dialog() works off of a jquery object that has been turned into a dialog.  'how' it selects that jquery object is irrelevant to the function
[05:40:25] <gregf_> man, let me give that a whirl :)
[05:40:52] <gregf_> i've been given a Perl backend and a Html5 frontend and i need to make them both work :/
[05:41:15] <randomguy1> :)
[05:42:21] <gregf_> oh my. never knew it was that simple :/
[05:42:31] <gregf_> randomguy1++
[05:42:52] <randomguy1> sometimes you psych yourself out, :)
[05:42:59] <gregf_> i thought $dialog could not be referred that way :/
[05:43:06] <gregf_> randomguy1: Thanks very much!
[05:56:08] <gambl0re> shouldnt ajax be called ajaj instead?
[05:56:33] <randomguy1> asynchronous javascript and xml
[05:56:57] <gambl0re> asynchronous javascript and json
[05:57:05] <randomguy1> *shrug*
[05:57:42] <randomguy1> i think most people associate "ajax" with asynchronous web request, don't really attribute a data schema to it
[05:57:58] <randomguy1> i mean, if you do a basic get request there is no xml or json at all
[05:58:14] <randomguy1> what would you call it then?
[05:58:20] <randomguy1> aj
[05:58:21] <randomguy1> :)
[05:58:26] <Uhkis> ajad ;)
[05:58:45] <Uhkis> asynchronous javascript and data!
[05:59:04] <Cork> gambl0re: ajax is built around xmlhttprequest
[05:59:22] <Cork> and that is partially where it gets its name from
[06:00:03] <Cork> js is about to spurt a new replacement interface for xhr though :)
[06:00:11] <randomguy1> oh?
[06:00:17] <Cork> fetch
[06:00:29] <gambl0re> .fetch()
[06:00:43] <Cork> http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/

[06:15:51] <ilhami> anyone who has used fullcalendar?
[07:01:05] <marandi> hi guys , can you check it out please ? http://jsfiddle.net/nzbxctz8/  , i want to change color active class in css , but seems like i don't know what to do .. !
[07:04:15] <jcmcbeth> You want to what?
[07:04:17] <Cork> marandi: $() works with dom elements not stylesheets
[07:04:28] <Cork> so you can't do it like that
[07:04:54] <Cork> also it isn't a good idea to modify the stylesheet as the page is running (it is very costly)
[07:05:18] <Cork> marandi: instead have a class on ex div.colors and add/replace a class on that
[07:05:25] <Cork> that overrides what color the different things has
[07:05:37] <marandi> Cork: right , i want to change the color of active tabs to user preferences .
[07:05:43] <Cork> (sorry a class on .nav)
[07:05:58] <Cork> marandi: ya, do that with a class, not in js
[07:06:09] <marandi> Cork: ok so ur saying , i should add some new class to the clicked tab right ?!
[07:06:20] <Cork> marandi: no to the ul parent
[07:06:41] <Cork> .nav-tabs should get a class dictating what color the active tab should have
[07:07:07] <Cork> but ya, if you want different colors on each tab, then yes you would
[07:07:43] <marandi> Cork: no i need the same color on every tabs , can you gimme a hint on jsfiddle please ?!
[07:08:23] <Cork> marandi: $('.nav-tabs').removeClass('black bisque gray coral').addClass($(this).data('color'))
[07:08:46] <Cork> marandi: the rest goes into the css file
[07:10:24] <marandi> Cork: got it , let me modify it ...
[07:19:01] <toocwa> I am dynamically changing contents of a div using by ajax, but have a series of jQuery functions I want applied to those newly added elements, e.g. $(newstuff).jstree(); and $(newstuff).sortable(); of course just adding that JS to the page only binds it when the page is first created, not when contents are changed by ajax
[07:19:37] <toocwa> I understand delegation in cases of $("#container").on("click",newstuff.function(){});
[07:19:48] <toocwa> but is there a good way to do that with other functions?
[07:20:24] <toocwa> right now i just have all that jquery wrapped in a regular JS function which I call every time the ajax is called, so they get bound at that point
[07:20:29] <toocwa> is that bad practice though
[07:20:39] <Cork> toocwa: you would have to create a function you call after that ajax call has successed
[07:20:46] <Cork> cause you can't delegate functions only events
[07:21:06] <Cork> toocwa: no it isn't bad practice cause it is the only way
[07:21:18] <toocwa> right ok, thanks!
[07:21:29] <Cork> the alternative is if the plugins support binding in a dynamic way
[07:21:35] <Cork> but far from all do that
[07:21:36] <toocwa> its literally like function myInit( $(stuff).sortable(); );
[07:21:42] <toocwa> and every time i use the ajax i do myInit();
[07:21:56] <toocwa> im surprised im doing it correctly but thats good news then lol
[07:22:35] <Cork> toocwa: if you by myInit($(stuff).sortable()) mean you send in only the new stuff
[07:22:40] <Cork> then ya, that is the way to do it
[07:23:18] <toocwa> well in this example, "stuff" is always the same element, but that element is getting totally rebuilt when ajax runs
[07:23:31] <toocwa> what was there before gets removed from the page
[07:23:42] <Cork> ah, then ya that works
[07:23:52] <toocwa> thanks !
[07:23:52] <Cork> just make sure you don't add something to the shared parent
[07:23:59] <Cork> as it could stack in those cases
[07:24:07] <toocwa> right hten it would all run twice
[07:24:12] <toocwa> or more times
[07:24:16] <Cork> exactly
[07:24:23] <toocwa> if i make that mistake i should see it in firebug console :P
[07:24:31] <Cork> toocwa: though i would recommend to delegate all event handlers
[07:24:56] <toocwa> hm ok you lost me a bit there
[07:25:23] <Cork> the function should only initiate widgets that needs to be initialized for the new content
[07:25:37] <Cork> event handlers can be delegated to a static parent and doesn't need to be readded
[07:26:05] <toocwa> think i know what u mean
[07:26:30] <toocwa> like making sure $("#container").on("click","stuff"); is kept outside of the function
[07:26:41] <toocwa> because thats delegated anyway
[07:27:37] <Cork> yup
[07:28:00] <toocwa> and if ajax content varies, have more than 1 function and only run the appropriate functions
[07:28:08] <toocwa> thanks for the help
[07:28:26] <Cork> how you structure it is up to you, but basically ya
[07:29:30] <toocwa> :)
[08:08:57] <xniz> hey guys. lets say i have a div block that i want to

[08:09:03] <xniz> how would i go about doing this?
[08:09:45] <randomguy1> $.detach()
[08:09:46] <shoky> $('#mydiv').appendTo('#newParent')
[08:09:46] <xniz> ahh.. i just answered the question myself...
[08:09:52] <xniz> lol randomguy1 yep
[08:10:02] <xniz> $.detach() and appendTo :P
[08:10:20] <shoky> detach is only needed to keep jquery events/data for the element
[08:10:42] <xniz> shoky alright. and that is what I'm looking for
[08:10:47] <shoky> oks
[08:11:09] <xniz> thanks guys. i shouldve just googled real quick but i wasn't sure if there was a "standard" for this

[08:14:23] <xniz> Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource. <-- I guess that explains it
[08:14:32] <xniz> seems like i should install apache in the background :/

[08:59:54] <dimi1947> I want the remainder of it....and bear in mind that string may vary in length but always finishes with _b
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> right - look at the fiddle.
[09:00:26] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, if it's always going to be _b, just use .replace()

[09:36:30] <graphettion> Has anyone done any programming in SCORM cmi.core.suspend_data?
[09:37:47] <robertmaxrees> graphettion might have more luck in #web maybe?
[09:38:21] <graphettion> Maybe :P Thank you!
[09:39:11] <graphettion> It's pure JS stuff.
[09:39:50] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript might be a better place then?  otherwise, just ask your question.
[10:16:42] <Minnebo> Hellow, I'm having an issue with Owl Caroussel, this page works in every browser, but on iPad the owl dots wont work. Well they do work, because they load the new size of the portrait image, but the image itself is not refreshing http://gevelrenovatie-govaert.be/content/sierpleister
[10:18:22] <xniz> I'm working on a SPA. I am loading content dynamically through jquery's ().load function. I  have delegated an event handler to some of the content that was loaded dynamically. now my question is, can i use delegate within delegate?
[10:18:53] <xniz> `pastebin
[10:19:21] <xniz> http://jsfiddle.net/k4qq58da/ is my jfiddle
[10:19:56] <xniz> the first call to ().delegate works fine. but the second one does not
[10:20:43] <robertmaxrees> xniz 1st off, use .on() in favor of .delegate()
[10:21:24] <robertmaxrees> xniz the entire point of delegated listeners is you bind them ahead of time.
[10:21:25] <xniz> for both of them?
[10:21:32] <robertmaxrees> for all of them, yes.
[10:21:44] <robertmaxrees> but don't conditionally bind listeners in the first place.
[10:22:14] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('click', '#page .view-tracks-1', function() {}); for instance.
[10:22:26] <hlvwrk> Robert, what's wrong with this jQuery?
[10:22:27] <hlvwrk> if ((ver.indexOf('TestHere') || ver.indexOf('HereText')) !== -1) {
[10:22:44] <xniz> I'll try, but the other day I could not get the event handler to bind without using delegate
[10:22:58] <hlvwrk> basically checking to see if ver ==  HereText, or TextHere ... do this.
[10:23:12] <robertmaxrees> xniz what version of jquery are you running
[10:23:12] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:23:26] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk that's... just javascript?
[10:23:46] <xniz> 2.1.3-min.
[10:23:47] <hlvwrk> is there a better way to do that via jQuery that actually works?
[10:24:03] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk you don't use jquery for string comparisons like that..
[10:24:06] <xniz> robertmaxrees and that line you gave me worked... hmmm why would someone tell me to use delegate
[10:24:06] <robertmaxrees> it's javascript.
[10:24:24] <robertmaxrees> xniz that's the delegated syntax for on.
[10:24:32] <robertmaxrees> may have been a miscommunication.
[10:24:36] <hlvwrk> it's not working so0o0o. <_>
[10:24:39] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk you can't "group" indexOfs like that.
[10:24:44] <hlvwrk> ah
[10:25:00] <robertmaxrees> if ((ver.indexOf('TestHere') > -1 || ver.indexOf('HereText') > -1)) {
[10:25:52] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk do you wnat to know if that "ver" variable actually IS 'TestHere' or 'HereText'?
[10:25:58] <xniz> robertmaxrees thank you for the solution ;)
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> or just if it contains those strings?
[10:26:28] <hlvwrk> basically ver = a version number,  I need to check to see if the version number is one of two versions
[10:26:34] <hlvwrk> so yes
[10:26:44] <robertmaxrees> then just use ===
[10:27:14] <robertmaxrees> if (ver === 'TestHere' || ver === 'HereText') {
[10:27:22] <hlvwrk> Ahh
[10:27:41] <hlvwrk> Thank you
[10:27:42] <hlvwrk> :)
[10:28:11] <hlvwrk> works perfect. mucho gracias.
[10:38:17] <bofo> hello
[10:38:43] <bofo> im working on a wordpress theme and im trying to disable weekends on datepicker but i can't seem to get it to work - here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/z30j8uke/ -- can anyone tell me where im going wrong please
[10:40:23] <tejasmanohar> if i have a promise jquery xhr object... var promiseObject how do i get a value on it (a property) once its resolved
[10:41:23] <robertmaxrees> tejasmanohar you mean of the returned data?
[10:41:57] <tejasmanohar> promiseObject.done(function(r) { console.log(r.property); }]
[10:42:00] <tejasmanohar> robertmaxrees: yea
[10:42:06] <robertmaxrees> `^ like that.
[10:44:12] <robertmaxrees> bofo http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z30j8uke/1/
[10:44:24] <robertmaxrees> it's jQuery.datepicker.noWeekends, not jQuery(this)datepicker.noWeekends
[10:45:07] <robertmaxrees> also - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z30j8uke/2/
[10:45:58] <robertmaxrees> bofo you should also avoid doing var month = new Array(12); - just do var month = [];  even better, go ahead and insert all your months up ahead.
[10:46:55] <robertmaxrees> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z30j8uke/5/
[10:47:16] <tejasmanohar> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/etldFkF.png https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/38500dd993917290c9cf
[10:47:36] <robertmaxrees> wat?
[10:47:41] <tejasmanohar> console.log(response) seems to log the same thing as response.responseText
[10:47:47] <robertmaxrees> oh coffeescript. uh - have the native JS version?
[10:47:55] <tejasmanohar> sry one sec lemme see
[10:48:07] <tejasmanohar> i dont like CS either its an older bigger project that i wasnt working on before
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/rwefly5/
[10:48:42] <robertmaxrees> this is what it'd look like.
[10:48:56] <bofo> robertmaxrees: thank you
[10:49:18] <tejasmanohar> does the imgur from devtools look right tho? for a promise object? robertmaxrees
[10:49:33] <robertmaxrees> tejasmanohar what are you console logging?
[10:49:46] <bofo> i have 3 books on jquery but instead of reading them i spend most of my time google'ing things and working the dirty way
[10:50:01] <robertmaxrees> bofo you should check out learn.jquery.com :)
[10:50:29] <tejasmanohar> see gist, console logging the promise object
[10:50:40] <robertmaxrees> tejasmanohar that's not helpful - magicResponse = @collection.fetchMagicString()
[10:50:42] <tejasmanohar> console.log(response.responseText) and console.log(response) print the same thing for me
[10:50:44] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what this is doing.
[10:50:44] <tejasmanohar> weird
[10:50:46] <tejasmanohar> oh
[10:51:20] <robertmaxrees> that's why i showed you the basic idea earlier ;)
[10:52:00] <robertmaxrees> the data in that .done() callback is supposed to just be the data from the server - not the promise object itself.
[10:53:43] <tejasmanohar> ah
[10:53:49] <tejasmanohar> thx
[10:53:56] <tejasmanohar> this is a mess
[10:53:58] <tejasmanohar> CS is hard to read
[10:54:06] <robertmaxrees> word.
[10:54:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use plain JS in there, can't you?
[12:08:06] <daynaskully> {Q} if i create an on click event which fires a few animations within it; how do i prevent continual clicking on the main element (that will cause it to break)
[12:08:24] <randomguy1> you could do a transparent overlay on the page
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> you could also check to see if the animation is running.
[12:09:35] <randomguy1> show() it while your processing, hide() it when your done
[12:16:00] <decx> set data on the element you click
[12:16:18] <decx> if (!self.data('active')) return
[12:19:23] <randomguy1> might want to cancel propagation before the return

[14:22:20] <cardguy1000_> I’m trying to use a plugin (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) with jquery mobile.  There is a problem where it will not load any images on first page load, but once I resize the window it loads the images.  In my html file I have several pages.  If I make the page that uses the plugin the first page then it will work.  I’m assuming that the event that triggers for the plugin to initilize uses something like pageshow an
[14:22:20] <cardguy1000_> jquery mobile isn’t triggering that on changing internal pages.  Any ideas?
[14:35:08] <cardguy1000_> Alternatively, all I’m looking to do is make an image slider that will show images horizontally and user can swipe left right to show more.  Any suggested plugins

[14:59:42] <xniz> k lemme mess with it.
[14:59:50] <xniz> im reuploading my files on my webserver one moment
[15:01:03] <xniz> shoky i am only getting that error when the file is uploaded to my web server
[15:01:07] <xniz> otherwise, locally, i get no errors
[15:01:26] <xniz> and the code looks ok...
[15:02:24] <shoky> xniz: it has:   $('body').on('click', '#artist-1 li', function () { ... }} );
[15:02:30] <shoky> xniz: notice the double }}
[15:04:21] <xniz> sorry.. but no i dont... my brackets line up fine and the syntax hilighting in my editor doesnt show a double bracket
[15:04:46] <xniz> weird
[15:04:51] <shoky> xniz: ok it changed now..
[15:05:05] <xniz> its still not fixed though
[15:05:06] <shoky> xniz: now the problem is function playTrack(Track, filename) {    is not closed
[15:05:22] <shoky> xniz: because there is a comment in there, and it's all in one line so it's a comment till the end of the line...

[15:06:05] <xniz> shoky thank you. fixed
[15:06:13] <shoky> yw
[15:06:36] <xniz> that was irritating me lol. i still don't know where/how the extra bracket got in there because I swear.. i never seen it or changed it lol
[15:06:41] <xniz> my brain is fried >.<
[15:06:55] <FriedZombie> braaaiiiinzzz

[15:09:32] <xniz> k guys. thanks for the help today. xniz out :)
[15:27:16] <cardguy1000_> How can I react to an event when a certain page is loaded?  For instance in this fiddle I’d like to alert the users when page2 is encoutered
[15:27:17] <cardguy1000_> http://jsfiddle.net/djaazvcm/
[15:27:40] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/
[15:28:09] <robertmaxrees> check these out.  pagechange might be one you can hook into.
[15:28:24] <cardguy1000_> I did go there, but I’m unsure what I’m supposed to use when they use .selector in their examples
[15:28:32] <cardguy1000_> is the page id the selector
[15:29:17] <robertmaxrees> oh wait you're supposed to use https://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/ it looks like.
[15:29:32] <robertmaxrees> pagecontainerchange is what you're looking for there.
[15:29:32] <cardguy1000_> Yeah, that’s what I’m trying in my fiddle
[15:30:18] <robertmaxrees> the events probably bubble, so you could probably do $('body').on('pagecontainerchange', function() {});
[15:30:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could init the container with the binding already there.
[15:33:23] <cardguy1000_> I have the same result http://jsfiddle.net/djaazvcm/1/
[15:35:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:36:15] <rubyronin> good day all! whats the best way to ajax json data into jquery mobile internal pages
[15:48:07] <robertmaxrees> rubyronin that's an interesting question - what are you trying to do?
[15:48:17] <robertmaxrees> cardguy1000_ i'm... at a loss.
[15:48:43] <rubyronin> robertmaxrees: i'm attempting to load all of my post from my wordpress back end and only display an image initilaly, when the image is clicked i want the content to show
[15:48:49] <rubyronin> but i don't want the link to go to the wordpress site
[15:49:00] <rubyronin> i want to retain everything in jqm, as i am using that for a phonegap app
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> rubyronin okay - expose an API for the JSON.  when the user hits the URL, show the image and pull in the JSON.
[15:49:40] <robertmaxrees> use templateting to render out the JSON.
[15:49:41] <rubyronin> roertmaxrees: that parts completed
[15:49:51] <robertmaxrees> that's what your backend is for.
[15:49:56] <rubyronin> templateting? that parts foreign
[15:50:21] <robertmaxrees> it's just a fancy way to say "build HTML using data"
[15:51:32] <rubyronin> robertmaxrees: so how i ensure when the link is clicked the new data is rendered in the same page?
[15:51:46] <robertmaxrees> templating.
[15:51:59] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to build it all out and then manually init it.
[15:52:30] <Pazician> Hello, does anyone know why my both ul's triggers when I use this code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7bddfec2f48679e58523
[15:52:40] <rubyronin> robertmaxrees: you got a template framework recommendation?
[15:52:50] <rubyronin> and a link to a speeed tutorial?
[15:52:52] <robertmaxrees> rubyronin underscore has built-in templating.
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> no tutorials.
[15:52:56] <rubyronin> i'm crunching man
[15:53:06] <rubyronin> can i run underscore on top of jqm?
[15:53:09] <robertmaxrees> you have a few different technologies to combine here.
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> err, it's not "on top of", but yeah.
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> you can use both.
[15:53:19] <rubyronin> and can this be done without templating?
[15:53:29] <robertmaxrees> is your data in JSON?
[15:53:35] <rubyronin> robertmaxrees: es
[15:53:38] <rubyronin> yes
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> than you'll need some kind of templating.
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> Pazician huh?
[15:54:01] <rubyronin> hmmm....ok, homework it is
[15:54:04] <rubyronin> thanks
[15:54:33] <rubyronin> pazician: you have two ul's in the second line. why?
[15:54:52] <Pazician> rubyronin: It's a dropdown menu
[15:54:58] <robertmaxrees> Pazician make a fiddle.
[15:55:02] <rubyronin> where's the fiddle?
[15:55:45] <Pazician> rubyronin: There's no Fiddle, it's just simple two dropdown menus, and when I run the code it just triggers both at the same time, which is pretty annoying.
[15:56:00] <rubyronin> pazician: then create one so we can help you
[15:56:04] <robertmaxrees> we ccan't see your markup, Pazician
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> so it's hard to help.
[15:57:59] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/e9y0g99L/
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:31] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What's up?
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle doesn't run PHP
[15:58:56] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: PHP, what about it?
[15:59:04] <Pazician> There's no PHP, lol.
[15:59:06] <robertmaxrees> you have php in your markup.
[15:59:14] <robertmaxrees> <img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/images/kik.png" alt="">
[15:59:20] <Pazician> It's WordPress
[15:59:31] <Pazician> Don't mind the broken images..
[15:59:33] <robertmaxrees> right - that's PHP.
[16:00:00] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* anyway... you need to associate each button to each dropdown somehow.
[16:00:24] <arc_> this issue seems to come up a lot
[16:00:37] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[16:00:38] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Like specifify each one? So there's no way that it would work like using "this" in jQuery or similiar?
[16:00:47] <arc_> yes you can do that
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[16:01:04] <arc_> why not?
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of. add a data attribute to the links that tells you which menu item the link is for.
[16:01:40] <Pazician> Well, I could just go for a class and newbie code it all, right?
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not "newbie code"
[16:02:40] <robertmaxrees> something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/e9y0g99L/1/

[17:21:37] <rcyr> I don't know, sorry
[17:21:43] <mistergibson> thanks anyways :)
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> mistergibson https://github.com/ROMB/jquery-dialogextend this shows up in a google search.

[19:23:42] <Dr-007> how to wait for someone to complete typing? put a setTimeout in a onkeyup event, and reset that timer each time a key stroke happend?
[19:26:32] <rcyr> Dr-007: That's pretty much the standard approach. It's usually called a "debounce" function.
[19:26:33] <shoky> Dr-007: yeah, that's called debounce, there are many plugins/libraries that can do it for you

[22:16:21] <atdiehm> am i able to discuss jeditable in here?
[22:17:47] <dopie> hey all
[22:18:06] <dopie> what do i use if i want to show or hide a div?
[22:18:12] <dopie> .toggle is deprecated
[22:18:29] <spyyke> you just ruined my day
[22:18:50] <spyyke> though i don't even use it anymore
[22:19:59] <atdiehm> the first time I click the element, jeditable shows me the proper field, and submit button, upon submission, everything updates properly, but if I click that same item again, it's a very small ( 3px wide? ) input box that displays
[22:20:01] <spyyke> function showStuff(stuffnumber) {     $( '[id^="menucontent-"]' ).attr("style", "display: none");
[22:20:39] <spyyke>     $( '[id^="menucontent-"]' ).attr("style", "display: none");
[22:20:48] <spyyke> hides all , shows menucontent-stuffnumber
[22:21:53] <dopie> The documentation says that the .toggle() function is deprecated (http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event), but there isn't any alternative method indicated.
[22:30:01] <Uhkis> .toggle() is not deprecated
[22:30:40] <Uhkis> .toggle(handler) is
[22:31:08] <spyyke> good, good. i almost shit my pants for nothing
[22:31:18] <Uhkis> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
