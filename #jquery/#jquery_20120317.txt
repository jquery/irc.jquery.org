[00:00:07] <abjorn> true
[00:00:12] <TylerWhitney> then -> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[00:00:25] <TylerWhitney> I doubt either or would be noticeably faster
[00:00:30] <smares> isn't that the other way?
[00:00:31] <TylerWhitney> one might just be fewer lines of code
[00:00:45] <abjorn> nah tylerwhitney that creates a querystring
[00:00:47] <TylerWhitney> lol yeah I think I copied and pasted wrong one
[00:01:16] <TylerWhitney> yeah I think the first one is best
[00:01:26] <TylerWhitney> because I dont think there is an easier way for querystring to object?
[00:02:04] <abjorn> there's probably an internal function for it, just like there's an internal for parsing json
[00:02:39] <TylerWhitney> http://remysharp.com/2008/06/24/query-string-to-object-via-regex/
[00:03:02] <TylerWhitney> or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[00:03:12] <abjorn> now we're just getting craaazy
[00:03:15] <abjorn> we already solved the problem
[00:03:15] <TylerWhitney> but I don't see how any of those would be better than just using the function in the get go
[00:03:18] <abjorn> NO MORE NO MORE
[00:03:21] <TylerWhitney> lol
[00:03:33] <abjorn> lets solve the problem TEN MORE TIMES
[00:03:49] <abjorn> :(
[00:03:51] <TylerWhitney> OR, a function that converst query string back to json, then use json to XML converter and then parse the XML
[00:03:52] <abjorn> I ran out of tequila
[00:05:13] <abjorn> SOMEONE GO GET ME MORE
[00:05:25] <abjorn> eh i suppose they don't sell that at 2 am
[00:05:31] <TylerWhitney> what we do at my company is send all queries to a server side script that presents the data to a sad old man with no job or family that works for less than minimum wage and he reads and interperets the data and retypes it in the correct format
[00:05:55] <abjorn> efficient
[00:06:02] <TylerWhitney> he's way faster than jQuery
[00:06:16] <abjorn> I'm pretty sure he's not faster than a simple funciton like that
[00:06:19] <TylerWhitney> we call him jimQuery, his name is jim
[00:06:30] <abjorn> jayqweries
[00:07:03] <TylerWhitney> heres a new problem to solve, I need to basically give all divs on a page a random colored border
[00:07:49] <abjorn> I'LL TAKE THE CASE
[00:07:51] <TylerWhitney> probably will make an array of colors to choose from, then I need to write something in jquery that will go through each div and give each a border color picking a random color from the array
[00:08:02] <abjorn> nah
[00:08:07] <TylerWhitney> again, a stupid client request :-(
[00:08:08] <abjorn> we'll do this the hardcore way
[00:08:11] <abjorn> random HEX code color
[00:09:47] <TylerWhitney> i thought about that
[00:09:56] <TylerWhitney> but what if we get a ton of blacks/browns/grays
[00:09:59] <TylerWhitney> the client wants COLOR
[00:10:41] <abjorn> https://gist.github.com/2055973
[00:10:45] <smares> use an array of colorful color names and pick random ones? :P
[00:10:46] <abjorn> THEN HE CAN SUCK IT
[00:10:53] <systemfault> Use hotpink everywhere.
[00:11:01] <systemfault> The client will be satisfied.
[00:11:04] <TylerWhitney> LOL
[00:11:12] <abjorn> #D34DB33F
[00:11:13] <TylerWhitney> but on a serious note, he probably would
[00:11:29] <abjorn> I may have put too many hexes in that color code
[00:11:30] <TylerWhitney> I forget how much I like .each too
[00:11:30] <abjorn> in that gist
[00:11:47] <abjorn> I'm pretty sure color codes don't have 16 hex digits
[00:12:05] <TylerWhitney> lol...
[00:12:13] <abjorn> https://gist.github.com/2055973 THERE FIXED
[00:12:15] <abjorn> it is perfect.
[00:12:25] <abjorn> I should make this a bookmarklet
[00:12:27] <TylerWhitney> I may implement that just ot humor you
[00:12:34] <TylerWhitney> but I will probably go with an array of colors, lol
[00:13:39] <abjorn> oh i guess it'd be hard to make it a bookmarklet when it requires jquery
[00:15:04] <TylerWhitney> https://gist.github.com/e6e377a50435159c637d
[00:15:16] <abjorn> you monster
[00:15:28] <abjorn> psh
[00:15:29] <abjorn> floor
[00:15:47] <TylerWhitney> woops
[00:15:50] <abjorn> I've had far too much to drink to care about Math.floor!
[00:15:52] <TylerWhitney> forgot colors[] around the random
[00:16:04] <TylerWhitney> it will just print a number -_-
[00:16:12] <abjorn> but of course
[00:16:25] <TylerWhitney> there fixed
[00:16:29] <TylerWhitney> genius
[00:16:49] <TylerWhitney> I give you credit though, if any old HEX was good then yours was optimal
[00:17:04] <abjorn> the more random the better!
[00:17:06] <TylerWhitney> now to pick some colors
[00:17:16] <abjorn> im going to make it even better
[00:17:20] <TylerWhitney> I seriously thing hot pink, orange, bright red; the shittier the better
[00:17:28] <TylerWhitney> clients love flashy shitty stuff
[00:17:51] <TylerWhitney> and Im not getting paid well enough for this contract because I sort of "owe" the guy so I don't care, I just won't advertise that I did this one
[00:18:18] <systemfault> ?eval '#' + (new Array(7)).join(0).split('').map(function() { return (Math.random() * 16 | 0).toString(16); }).join('');
[00:18:22] <bot-t1> systemfault: "#17620c"
[00:18:30] <systemfault> :/
[00:19:20] <abjorn> you beautiful bastard
[00:19:35] <abjorn> https://gist.github.com/2055973
[00:19:40] <abjorn> NEVER THE SAME COLOR
[00:19:41] <abjorn> EVER
[00:19:47] <TylerWhitney> wow this place is hardcore, need to come here more often
[00:20:34] <TylerWhitney> can you seriously believe that though, he wants a random color border on the vehicle thumbnails
[00:20:35] <TylerWhitney> lol
[00:20:37] <TylerWhitney> so stupid
[00:20:50] <abjorn> hahahaha
[00:20:56] <abjorn> i love the guy already
[00:20:59] <systemfault> :/
[00:21:01] <abjorn> MY KINDA GUY
[00:21:10] <systemfault> TylerWhitney: That makes me think about that oatmeal comic...
[00:21:21] <systemfault> http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
[00:21:23] <TylerWhitney> systemfault: I love oatmeal I know the one
[00:21:24] <TylerWhitney> YES
[00:21:33] <systemfault> :P
[00:21:34] <TylerWhitney> oh man thank you for this
[00:21:35] <smares> yay, we have that at work on a wall :D
[00:21:40] <abjorn> hahahaha
[00:22:03] <abjorn> the oatmeal and xkcd comics are everywhere in our office
[00:22:10] <TylerWhitney> UGH "minor" changes
[00:22:25] <TylerWhitney> Im reading it now but I think the word "pop" is somewhere there... I could strangle
[00:22:34] <abjorn> we also have a meeting room with glass walls that a few people put up nyan cat in colored sticky notes
[00:23:17] <tw2113> abjorn no cyanide and happiness? http://www.explosm.net/comics/2738/
[00:23:29] <abjorn> no
[00:23:33] <abjorn> nope
[00:23:35] <abjorn> just chuck testa
[00:23:42] <abjorn> ^ that's on one of our walls too
[00:25:28] <TylerWhitney> LMFAO I LOVE this it never gets old "you are now a mouse cursor inside a graphics program which the client can control by speaking, emailsing, and IMing"
[00:26:14] <smares> what's the best way to access the "outside" this within a $.each block?
[00:26:24] <smares> store this in a var outside the loop?
[00:28:05] <abjorn> yes
[00:29:18] <systemfault> Would have been easier if the creator of jquery didn't have the idea to use "this" inside the callback as being the element :/
[00:30:06] <abjorn> Eh, most of the time (at least for me) it's useful more than problematic
[00:30:22] <smares> why not use Element (2nd param)?
[00:30:41] <systemfault> abjorn: lulz.each(function(node) {}); would have been as easy.. no?
[00:30:44] <abjorn> whether you use that or not, smares, it's going to set the this scope
[00:30:56] <abjorn> systemfault: for sure
[00:31:26] <smares> I know, but I mean why is the this scope even set, we have Element already
[00:31:28] <abjorn> idk, either way it goes it wouldn't bothered me much
[00:31:46] <smares> which is even more lightweight since it's the element itself and not an object
[00:31:50] <abjorn> smares: it's just kind of a convention.
[00:32:11] <abjorn> throughout jquery, if there's a callback passed to a function, it's scope is set to the thing it's dealing with
[00:32:18] <abjorn> it's just kind of how jquery works
[00:32:27] <abjorn> so they're not gonna break that for one function
[00:33:07] <abjorn> Consistency like that is exactly why jQuery is so easy, and why people learn jQuery and don't learn JavaScript
[00:33:37] <abjorn> man im too sober now, i think that means i need to go to bed
[00:34:34] <systemfault> This works.. but is a bit ugly.. http://jsfiddle.net/7LSFe/
[00:35:05] <systemfault> So you "can" set "this"
[00:36:43] <TylerWhitney> bah you got me on oatmeal and im not finishing work, meanwhile, 3:30am here
[00:36:52] <systemfault> :/
[00:36:54] <systemfault> Same here
[00:37:11] <TylerWhitney> minor differences cracks me up
[00:50:28] <ribot> hi
[00:51:19] <ribot> how can i iterate all tr inside #t? tried different combinations like $("#t td") with and without .each()
[00:52:58] <systemfault> Why do you target the td if you want the tr?
[00:54:08] <TylerWhitney> omg Im laughing so hard Im going to wake my fiance
[00:54:14] <systemfault> :P
[00:54:16] <TylerWhitney> customer service oatmeal is funny
[00:54:19] <systemfault> She will kill you :)
[00:54:32] <TylerWhitney> its a shame my office is so close to the bedroom :-/
[00:55:31] <ribot> hmm syntax error X)
[01:10:33] <TylerWhitney> wait, brain isn't working right, how do I do this if I want to get every div within a certain class?
[01:10:35] <TylerWhitney> $("div").each(function () {
[01:10:46] <TylerWhitney> is it? $(".class: div").each(function () {
[01:11:14] <systemfault> Like CSS
[01:11:21] <systemfault> div.my-class
[01:11:29] <TylerWhitney> oh, lol
[01:11:31] <systemfault> Hmm
[01:11:35] <TylerWhitney> sleep needed soon
[01:11:37] <systemfault> within a certain class?
[01:11:49] <systemfault> Perhaps I misunderstood the question.
[01:12:08] <TylerWhitney> yeah like <div class='crap'> <div></div> </div> and I want all those divs within the "crap" div
[01:12:14] <systemfault> Ahhh
[01:12:26] <systemfault> Then '.crap div'
[01:12:42] <TylerWhitney> I don't know where I got the colon from
[01:14:18] <thezoggy> div.crap
[01:14:53] <systemfault> He want's all divs within an element with class "crap"
[01:14:57] <systemfault> wants :/
[01:15:15] <TylerWhitney> its late I understand; my brain is mush too
[01:17:52] <TylerWhitney> #FF6EB4 <-- going in list
[01:25:51] <TylerWhitney> :-( it looks bad
[01:26:58] <tw2113> looks pink
[01:27:24] <TylerWhitney> http://www.plattsburghauto.com/dev/
[01:27:35] <TylerWhitney> clients wants, not me!!!!!
[01:28:47] <tw2113> clients say the darnedest things
[01:29:01] <TylerWhitney> :-/ indeed
[01:29:17] <TylerWhitney> I dont quite get the "random color image border" but it was pretty specific request after showing my initial setup
[01:29:30] <TylerWhitney> I had a really sweet header too with opacity and was just nice
[01:40:34] <TylerWhitney> heres a question, I forget how to exclude a class
[01:40:54] <TylerWhitney> e.g. if I have ".crap div" but i want to also exclude .notcrap from that selection
[01:41:40] <TylerWhitney> oh wait [class!=notcrap]
[01:41:51] <TylerWhitney> oh no
[01:41:55] <TylerWhitney> .not(".notcrap")
[01:56:17] <tizipaa> ciao
[01:56:20] <tizipaa> list
[02:06:25] <poppiez> is there any plugin available to allow for clickable input? that is, transforming e.g. a heading to an input field when clicked
[02:08:57] <BinaryKitten> poppiez $(selector).click(function() { var $this = $(this); $this.replaceWith($('<input>', {value: $this.text()})); });
[02:09:42] <poppiez> BinaryKitten: that
[02:09:45] <poppiez> woops
[02:09:51] <dns-away> hello :)
[02:09:58] <poppiez> BinaryKitten: that's a simple edition ;) I was thinking more like http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable but thx!
[02:10:25] <dns-away> anyone can help me :-> http://pastebin.com/8FrjCQLp :)
[02:10:25] <silv3r_m00n> I am assigning some event handlers like this $(elem).keydown(function(e) { });  what can I do in there to keep a track , to unbind later ?
[02:11:14] <BinaryKitten> silv3r_m00n  keep track of what? the bound events?
[02:11:15] <TylerWhitney> Is it cheating that I couldn't figure out how someone's photo script was working where you had to click a thumbnail image to make the fader fade to that image and so to make it work with on hover of the image I did $(".thumbnail img").each.mouseover( function(){ this.click() });
[02:11:45] <TylerWhitney> I mean, fuck it, it works
[02:11:53] <BinaryKitten> Tyler  there is no .each.mouseover?
[02:12:00] <silv3r_m00n> BinaryKitten: no , that function which was bound , say I gave it a name called menu , and then I can remove 'menu' from keydown handlers
[02:12:19] <silv3r_m00n> BinaryKitten: something like this $('#myimage').on('click.mynamespace', function() { /* Do stuff */ });
[02:12:46] <dns-away> Anyone can help me ? :)
[02:12:47] <dns-away> http://pastebin.com/8FrjCQLp
[02:13:00] <BinaryKitten> silv3r_m00n not sure still
[02:13:28] <BinaryKitten> you want to store the function?  so you can rebind it later?
[02:14:44] <silv3r_m00n> I will bind 10 handlers and I need to be able to remove a specific one later
[02:15:02] <silv3r_m00n> ok I will use this $('#myimage').on('click.mynamespace', function() { /* Do stuff */ }); $('#myimage').off('click.mynamespace');
[02:15:13] <Whirl3d> namespace each binding and remove that way.
[02:15:20] <Arno[Slack]> hi
[02:15:22] <TylerWhitney> yeah I typo'ed the .each, but i did it like this $(".scrollable img").mouseover(function() { this.click(); });
[02:15:24] <Whirl3d> like that
[02:15:42] <TylerWhitney> cheatinbg, but Im lazy
[02:15:48] <BinaryKitten> TylerWhitney use mouseEnter
[02:16:09] <TylerWhitney> why is it better?
[02:16:29] <BinaryKitten> because mouseover can fire more than once
[02:16:35] <aaairc> would anyone know why my jquery selector in this example isn't able to find its intended element?
[02:16:40] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/CdEqn/5/
[02:16:41] <BinaryKitten> mouseenter mouseleave fire once
[02:16:53] <TylerWhitney> BinaryKitten: thank you! I will change it now
[02:17:14] <aaairc> can jquery select an element that is delivered via an iframe? if so why is it not selecting the element?
[02:17:15] <TylerWhitney> like I said, I could find where in all the includes that particular module is handled...  but this is much easier for me...
[02:17:25] <BinaryKitten> dns-away if you want help, you're going to have to ask a question.. I for one aren't going to a random link without some clue as to what I'm going to be seeing
[02:17:34] <Whirl3d> aaorc. use console.log in place of alert blech
[02:17:38] <BinaryKitten> aaairc it can
[02:17:47] <BinaryKitten> but only in some cases
[02:18:00] <dns-away> Ok, Yes
[02:18:24] <dns-away> I have problem where i check if Object is empty }else{ no work (If empty)
[02:18:31] <aaairc> Whirl3d: with console.log http://jsfiddle.net/CdEqn/7/
[02:18:46] <aaairc> BinaryKitten: do you know why it doesn't seem to work in this case?
[02:18:54] <Arno[Slack]> I have a very annoying issue and I think it's because I have my eyes on it that I can't solve it
[02:19:11] <TylerWhitney> wow 5am and this channel picks up
[02:19:15] <aaairc> basically i'm trying to select an html element that is delivered via an iframe by facebook for a like button
[02:19:29] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: its when i always checkin
[02:19:36] <Whirl3d> aairc, try wrapping your code in $(docuyment).ready()
[02:19:42] <Arno[Slack]> Here https://github.com/adupuis/GYMActivity/blob/arnaud_dev/Web/submodules/profile_summary.php line 359 I have a function (actually another is just up this code because I tried many things already)
[02:19:42] <BinaryKitten> aaairc 1) you can't select it like that as it's not in the same document 2) you won't be able to select it anyway on a lot of browsers because it's a different domain
[02:19:45] <TylerWhitney> Ive been here since midnight... been up all night playing in code and reading oatmeal
[02:20:14] <Arno[Slack]> issue is : the success callback (or error in other tests) is never called in the $.get() function
[02:20:26] <TylerWhitney> aaairc: do you have control over the code snippet? I had to do the same thing recently, but iframe wont work as binarykitten explained, but you can use the other methods where it injects into the DOM
[02:20:41] <Arno[Slack]> if anyone have any hint on what I missed... I'll be very glad
[02:20:42] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d  it's in a different document show by an injected iFrame. There is nothing that can be done
[02:21:09] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I was looking at the fiddle, not the irc channel when he mentioned that.
[02:21:42] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: yes i have control
[02:21:46] <TylerWhitney> If you have control over the FB like button (http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/) when you click get code choose the HTML5 version or the FBML and you can work with what they inject
[02:22:06] <TylerWhitney> but as already stated, can't be done with iframe
[02:22:51] <TylerWhitney> Ive had to modify this myself before, if you're using FB in/around Flash the like button completely freaks out... as opposed to the Google+ button which works like a champ
[02:22:53] <aaairc> isn't the example i sent you the html5 version?
[02:23:27] <TylerWhitney> I didn't look at it, I just was answering the question about editing iframe content
[02:23:34] <TylerWhitney> what are you trying to accomplish?
[02:23:51] <BinaryKitten> it might be aaairc  but it's still inside an iframe inside your div
[02:24:12] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: when someone clicks the like button i want to grab the number of likes are listed in the count
[02:24:25] <aaairc> and set that as the popularity score in my database for the object that was liked
[02:24:27] * BinaryKitten loves how HTML5 is the almighty super fix to a lot of issues today (not)
[02:24:47] <BinaryKitten> aaairc you're going to have to use FBAPI for that
[02:24:52] <BinaryKitten> not a JS hack
[02:24:58] <dns-away> I need help
[02:24:59] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/CdEqn/8/
[02:25:28] <BinaryKitten> dns-away create a new fiddle
[02:25:33] <BinaryKitten> don't hijack aaairc's
[02:25:39] <aaairc> BinaryKitten: the thing i noticed with FBAPI is that it only provided the number of "likes" and not the total number of "likes and shares" which is what the button shows
[02:25:41] <dns-away> it is new!
[02:25:45] <TylerWhitney> FB.Event.subscribe('edge.create', function(href, widget) {
[02:25:45] <TylerWhitney>     alert('You just liked the page!');
[02:25:45] <TylerWhitney>   });
[02:26:00] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/hvqrk/
[02:26:06] <TylerWhitney> pretty simple callback when using the API
[02:26:41] <BinaryKitten> aaairc if GB don't provide the information via the API then you're out of luck sorry
[02:26:42] <dns-away> Here is new, sorry - > http://jsfiddle.net/hvqrk/2/
[02:26:55] <BinaryKitten> dns-away and now for the question?
[02:27:13] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: yes but that callback would only track the number of times the "like" button was clicked... where as the button itself displays the number of times it was clicked AND if a comment was written AND if the url was shared on Facebook
[02:27:13] <dns-away> alert no work
[02:27:26] <dns-away> BinaryKitten alert no work, please test
[02:27:38] <BinaryKitten> dns-away alert no work is not a question
[02:27:46] <dns-away> ko
[02:27:47] <dns-away> ok
[02:27:50] <dns-away> what is the problem
[02:27:57] <BinaryKitten> ?peace @ dns-away
[02:27:57] <bot-t> dns-away, please Pastebin: Expected result, Actual result, all (relevant) Code, any Errors/Exceptions - This is *not* a multiple-choice request, we need all of them
[02:28:26] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: i'm actually using that "edge.create" event right now... its just when the event occurs i want to grab the count value that is displayed on my webpage.
[02:28:34] <dns-away> code is easy
[02:28:39] <dns-away> please check and tell me what is the problem
[02:28:42] <dns-away> what is the problem really ?
[02:28:50] <dns-away> are you bot and no understand ?
[02:28:50] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: this is important because if the user clicks the like button, and writes a comment... then the like button will increment by 2
[02:29:04] <TylerWhitney> yes I see aaairc, or if they unlike...
[02:29:13] <Arno[Slack]> In my case I can't create a fiddle, the application I work on is already pretty huge and this JS is... Well really simple and I use it all the time, I think I miss something very obvious but I can't get my finger on it... (https://github.com/adupuis/GYMActivity/blob/arnaud_dev/Web/submodules/profile_summary.php#L359 for the problematic code)
[02:29:14] <dns-away> Here is code http://jsfiddle.net/hvqrk/2/
[02:29:20] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: actually you can subscribe to an unlike event aswell
[02:29:22] <BinaryKitten> EG dns-away : I have X, I would like it to do Y when Z happens. Currently Y is not happening. I have tried Solutions A B and C. Can anyone help me with D?
[02:29:27] <TylerWhitney> I see
[02:29:41] <TylerWhitney> aaairc: you may have to use a third party service to make it easier, like AddThis?
[02:29:44] <BinaryKitten> dns-away Code is code, without a purpose it can be mis read and you will not get the right answer
[02:29:51] <dns-away> BinaryKitten you re stupid idiot
[02:30:01] <dns-away> just test and will know what is the problem
[02:30:02] <BinaryKitten> and insulting the people trying to help is not going to get you any sympathy
[02:30:05] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: so i thought a simple little hack would be to scrape the count off the page... that way i would always ensure the popularity count i have in my database is aligned with the count that facebook is displaying to my users
[02:30:06] <Arno[Slack]> can't he be kicked ?
[02:30:19] <BinaryKitten> dns-away if it's that simple then you don't need help
[02:30:39] <dns-away> are you professional ?
[02:30:46] <BinaryKitten> yes
[02:30:50] <dns-away> what is this stupid question "what is the problem" ?
[02:31:00] <dns-away> in 5lines code
[02:31:02] <dns-away> wtf
[02:31:12] <BinaryKitten> I can see about 9 potential issues
[02:31:20] <aaairc> TylerWhitney: i'm also new to using the FB API, so i may be wrong about this... but it appeared as if the API only returned the number of times the like button was clicked... excluding the additional count of comments and shares. otherwise i would probably just use the API (although i think my hack would be easier, if i could get it to work)
[02:31:21] <dns-away> ..
[02:31:26] <rabbi1> This is what visualize provides me, how can get it proper, http://imagebin.org/203891
[02:31:38] <Arno[Slack]> dns-away: first ask politely, second stop ragging they already are in the midle of a conversation, finally if you are not happy you are free to leave
[02:31:50] <dns-away> fuck you

[02:34:10] <dnsaway> idiot
[02:34:16] <dnsaway> rabbi1 here no help
[02:34:24] <dnsaway> here idiots
[02:34:52] <Arno[Slack]> Amazing how this guys still pops on irc...
[02:34:56] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 if you please hold on while we have this pebcak issue, we will be glad to assist
[02:35:52] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 while we are waiting .. can you please create a pastebin of your code and explain what you're after?
[02:36:23] <Arno[Slack]> (well it's also funny to think he is probably ragging and insulting everyone... And everyone ignore him by that time ^^)
[02:36:41] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: nothing much of customization, its just the "visualize" plugin used for a basic table. just copy paste (do more, write less) :D
[02:36:58] <BinaryKitten> ok
[02:37:05] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: and if u see the image you will surely know what is expected and what is displayed
[02:37:24] <BinaryKitten> unfortunately the same issue for the just departed dnsaway
[02:37:31] <BinaryKitten> we can't assume anything,
[02:38:02] <BinaryKitten> and without seeing the code we can't give you any answers either
[02:38:24] <Arno[Slack]> Anyone for my small issue ?
[02:38:49] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack]  sorry i completely missed it. Can you please re-iterate it?
[02:38:58] <Arno[Slack]> yeah no problem
[02:39:16] <Arno[Slack]> Although like I said I can't get a fiddle on it
[02:39:25] <Arno[Slack]> cause the project is already pretty big
[02:39:35] <Arno[Slack]> the issue itself is really simple
[02:39:38] <Arno[Slack]> https://github.com/adupuis/GYMActivity/blob/arnaud_dev/Web/submodules/profile_summary.php#L359
[02:39:49] <Arno[Slack]> in this function there is a $.get() call
[02:39:50] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack] we may not need it if we get a good enough explanation :)
[02:40:05] <Arno[Slack]> and I never go through the callback function
[02:40:14] <Arno[Slack]> even if the response code is 200
[02:40:38] <Arno[Slack]> I think the isseu might be a problem in the event processisng or any stupid error like that
[02:40:53] <Arno[Slack]> because I use the code itself many time
[02:41:10] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack] lets wind back a little and see if we can debug it
[02:41:19] <BinaryKitten> does the log for line 366 happen?
[02:41:30] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: http://imagebin.org/203891 this is how the graph is and it is expected to be http://imagebin.org/203892
[02:41:35] <Arno[Slack]> yes
[02:41:53] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack] are you on the root of the site
[02:41:54] <Arno[Slack]> and the call is done (I can see the answer in the console)
[02:42:13] <Arno[Slack]> yes, at the root of the virtual host
[02:42:14] <BinaryKitten> again rabbi1  we can't help you from images
[02:42:39] <BinaryKitten> just to be positively clear, try adding a / before backend
[02:42:53] <Arno[Slack]> well... the structure is : loader.php include submodules/profile_summary.php wich calls the webservice
[02:42:54] <BinaryKitten> ?.get @ BinaryKitten
[02:42:55] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[02:43:05] <BinaryKitten> d'oh not the one i was looking for

[02:43:16] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[02:43:48] <Arno[Slack]> I'm becomig mad with this issue...
[02:44:08] <Arno[Slack]> I use this kind of code many time in the project and never had this problem
[02:44:13] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack] I'm looking at something for you... give me a moment please
[02:44:19] <Arno[Slack]> of course
[02:45:52] <Arno[Slack]> BinaryKitten: for information adding the full path from root is not changing anything
[02:46:04] <BinaryKitten> ok
[02:46:16] <BinaryKitten> Arno[Slack] do you have this in a demo page?
[02:47:07] <Arno[Slack]> I can arrange that if you let me 5 minutes
[02:47:12] <BinaryKitten> ok

[02:50:47] <btral> when i clicl on any of ips, it show me 2.cgi that have detailes od it's ip.
[02:50:57] <btral> how use variables in iframe?

[03:29:30] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 are you sure you've not got some CSS issues?
[03:29:47] <BinaryKitten> I can't debug the whole JS code as I don't know where to start
[03:29:49] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: 2 secs, i am getting you the right result
[03:30:28] <BinaryKitten> also on the left side, please use add Resources to link in the other JS libs you are using
[03:31:07] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: I have no idea why JSFiddle is not showing the graph :(
[03:31:33] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 because the visualize library is not linked
[03:31:35] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: can you have look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/WdTWq/4/

[03:39:21] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 in the fiddle see under "Manage Resources" on the left
[03:40:25] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: How can i add it there? http link ? or local link ?

[03:50:01] <BinaryKitten> keep at it
[03:50:08] <BinaryKitten> you'll get there
[03:50:12] * BinaryKitten has to sign off now
[03:50:21] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: oops, such a pain in ass :) thanks a lot
[03:51:31] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 no worries
[03:51:51] <BinaryKitten> sometimes magic gets cancelled out by the clouds of smoke
[03:52:37] <rabbi1> :)
[04:16:05] <VioByte> ugh.
[04:17:03] <VioByte> sucks when you mess up in jquery and google java console just says there is an error in the jquery api not really hinting at where it is in the original calling script
[04:17:06] <VioByte> *sigh*
[04:17:32] <nights``> happens often.. :(
[04:18:10] <marekw2143> why is $(document).ready( ) handler  called twice ? I'm runing jquery 1.72
[04:18:32] <marekw2143> *1.7.1
[04:19:59] <VioByte> sure your not calling it more then once?
[04:21:04] <marekw2143> VioByte: in page's source code it looks defined once
[04:21:49] <VioByte> maybe a loop somewhere in the code thats making you think its loading twice?
[04:22:03] <pajo> how do i get the dialog elemnt so i could do such thing: $(this).dialog().find(".someClass").text("bla bla bla")
[04:23:23] <xec> marekw2143: it should only fire once, maybe you included your script twice? do you have a live url?
[04:23:47] <marekw2143> xec: live url?
[04:24:14] <xec> address to site that is not working
[04:24:44] <xec> so we can debug
[04:25:38] <marekw2143> no, but in firebug there's information that following file: http://localhost:8000/site_media/js/jquery.js/eval/seq/2 is included
[04:25:51] <marekw2143> sounds like eval function is called somewhere
[04:25:54] <VioByte> pajo: $("#dialog-confirm").dialog(options etc);  and somewhere out of the dialog $("#dialog-confirm").find(".someClass").text("bla bla bla")
[04:28:22] <xec> marekw2143: I can't tell you why it's not working without seeing it firsthand

[04:29:17] <VioByte> ?jsfiddle @ marekw2143
[04:29:18] <bot-t1> marekw2143, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[04:29:22] <VioByte> typo
[04:29:23] <VioByte> lol
[04:29:25] <xec> ^^
[04:29:43] <xec> marekw2143: but more often than not, if some code is executed twice, it's because the js file is included two places
[04:32:31] <marekw2143> jsfiddle don't work since I'm using jqGrid
[04:32:47] <xec> you can add resources like plugins to your fiddle
[04:33:33] <marekw2143> but wait, there probably I had doubled some code
[04:36:18] <VioByte> love my new coding playlist :) You know.. the kind that makes you want to code and keep coding. ;^)
[04:37:28] <BinaryKitten> VioByte care to pastebin your playlist?
[04:37:28] <VioByte> can't code in silence... to stressful.. gotta have music.
[04:37:50] <BinaryKitten> My current Playlist includes Pendelum and Netsky
[04:37:51] <VioByte> lol
[04:37:58] <marekw2143> oooh, found cause of a "bug"
[04:38:16] <BinaryKitten> VioByte I agree on the not coding in silence
[04:38:25] <BinaryKitten> but am looking for new music to add to my playlist
[04:38:28] <marekw2143> div which had defined inlined call to $(document).ready... was used as JQuery dialog
[04:38:35] <marekw2143> and I guess that it copied that div
[04:38:38] <VioByte> @BinaryKitten http://pl.st/p/23118471691
[04:38:47] <VioByte> my current coding playlist
[04:38:47] <BinaryKitten> thankeshen
[04:39:37] <BinaryKitten> lol.. Due to licensing restrictions, some or all
[04:39:37] <BinaryKitten> tracks may be unavailable for playback
[04:39:37] <BinaryKitten> in your country.
[04:40:33] <BinaryKitten> have most of those tracks though
[04:40:55] <VioByte> thats funny. since they search the net for mp3's then add them to their CDN so technically it should be playable worldwide
[04:41:01] * BinaryKitten needs to sort out a randomiser for her songs
[04:41:28] <VioByte> they are like google's crawler bot.. but for mp3's
[04:41:42] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[04:41:51] <BinaryKitten> I love uk Copyright law :p
[04:43:16] <VioByte> BinaryKitten: well there is always HotSpot Shield to get around that ;)
[04:43:26] <BinaryKitten> meh
[04:43:33] <BinaryKitten> I prefer to not even worry about it
[04:43:49] <BinaryKitten> I'll buy the CD / mp3 from somewhere
[04:43:56] <VioByte> true.. not really worth it when there are 10000000 other places to get the same results :)
[04:46:25] <BinaryKitten> would anyone be willing to try/test the new version of my preloader pluging?

[07:17:06] <kanzie> Im trying to set up the h5bp ant-build script file for a single page web-app I've built that don't use h5bp at all. I just want a good deployment-routine. It is messy though and I wonder if anyone here has worked with it and can give me a few pointers?
[07:37:56] <Hawkee> morning folks
[07:38:06] <Hawkee> pretty quiet here this morning
[07:38:21] <Hawkee> you'd think people don't work on Saturday
[07:52:14] <phil-adept> hi all. Has anyone got the jquery ui css to work with jsfiddle?...
[07:52:41] <phil-adept> it's included the js lib's as expected however no basic css seems to be included?
[07:53:39] <phil-adept> or am I wrong in presuming that it should be included and you need to specifically load it as a resource?
[07:56:09] <Advocated> I'm doing: $("#dialog-form").dialog("option", "position", [position.left, position.top + 100]); but am trying to add: {dialogClass:'transparent'}  but no matter where i seem to put it, it doesn't add the class. any ideas please
[07:58:50] <phil-adept> $("#dialog-form").dialog("option", "position", [position.left, position.top + 100]).addClass( 'className' );
[07:59:45] <phil-adept> obv replace className for the correct class
[08:02:42] <Advocated> phil-adept, thanks ,even though it didnt make the dialog transparent it added the class to it though
[08:05:08] <adept-phil> can anyone offer some suggestions to get this working?...
[08:05:09] <adept-phil> http://jsfiddle.net/philwilliams81/3jsfP/1/
[08:05:33] <adept-phil> At the moment I am creating a file upload using Andris Valums js file
[08:05:50] <adept-phil> I'm using it alongside jQuery UI at the moment however I have an issue
[08:06:45] <adept-phil> It works fine if you do not use the 'modal' option with jquery ui's dialog() however if you set modal:true, it breaks. I think it's to do with the z-index of the file input field however could do with another perspective if anyone can take a look?...
[08:08:56] <adept-phil> anyone?
[08:09:37] <erebel55> is it possible to create a jQuery context menu that is created inside of an addEventListener('click', function(e) ?
[08:09:38] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, i am looking for a jquery plugin that allows me to select arrows to scroll text inside a mask div (up and down) no need for scroller..
[08:12:00] <adept-phil> ajpiano are you here fella?
[08:14:33] <adept-phil> erebel55: What exactly do you mean?
[08:15:53] <erebel55> well, I see lots of examples for creating a jquery context menu. but i want one that is shown when I click on an svg, so i'm not using jquery selectors. http://jsfiddle.net/m6N38/10/
[08:18:07] <erebel55> maybe this isn't a jquery question
[08:19:16] <adept-phil> erebel55: why can't you use $('svg').click( function(){ ... });
[08:20:37] <erebel55> oh I didn't realize it was possible like that
[08:21:04] <erebel55> but i want it to be different depending on what type of svg is clicked
[08:21:20] <Advocated> anyone know how to remove padding from a jquery dialog?
[08:21:30] <Advocated> tried adding .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content, .ui-tabs { padding:0; } to my css, but nothing
[08:22:15] <adept-phil> erebel55: You can reference the element you have clicked on in your code. For example $('svg').click( function(){ console.log( $(this).id; ) });
[08:22:33] <adept-phil> that will output the ID of the element you click on within the JS console.
[08:22:38] <adept-phil> the SVG element I mean
[08:22:45] <erebel55> wow that's sweet :)
[08:22:47] <erebel55> thanks
[08:23:09] <bdc> erebel55 just fyi, you can even use $('#myBox') too. SVGElements will behave just like HTMLElements as far as jQuery is concerned, in my experience.
[08:23:37] <erebel55> great, this is perfect then :D
[08:25:37] <adept-phil> bdc, thanks for that. I haven't played with svg that much so it's good to know :)
[08:26:02] <adept-phil> Has anyone taken a look at my problem?
[08:26:43] <adept-phil> http://jsfiddle.net/philwilliams81/3jsfP/1/
[08:26:48] <adept-phil> It works fine if you do not use the 'modal' option with jquery ui's dialog() however if you set modal:true, it breaks. I think it's to do with the z-index of the file input field however could do with another perspective if anyone can take a look?...
[08:29:24] <bdc> adept-phil What breaks? I tried setting modal to true on your fiddle and I don't see a problem.
[08:30:30] <adept-phil> bdc: there is a button to open the dialog and a button within the dialog to initiate a file upload. When modal : true it breaks?
[08:30:40] <adept-phil> the button within the dialog I mean :D
[08:31:22] <erebel55> shouldn't this hide the box? http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/1/
[08:31:26] <erebel55> just testing stuff out
[08:31:32] <adept-phil> the "upload file" button within the dialog
[08:32:11] <hemangpatel> hi there
[08:32:30] <hemangpatel> how to alert on browser close or tab close..
[08:32:49] <bdc> adept-phil I see.  Works in chrome on both my mac and windows box. But yes, broken in FF on windows. (didn't try FF on my mac)
[08:33:12] <adept-phil> grrrr
[08:33:12] <adept-phil> lol
[08:33:12] <adept-phil> the ONE browser I would have expected it to work on
[08:33:18] <adept-phil> aside from chrome
[08:34:02] <hemangpatel> anyone has answer of my question ?
[08:34:43] <erebel55> nvm fixed my prob
[08:34:53] <bdc> hemangpatel onUnload
[08:35:00] <adept-phil> erebel55: It does!! You've got the MooTools lib selected! Change it to jQuery and it works :)
[08:35:09] <erebel55> yeah hahaha thats what i saw :P
[08:35:14] <erebel55> thanks
[08:35:18] <hemangpatel> i try that but it doesnt work in firefox :D
[08:35:28] <hemangpatel> anyother solution ?
[08:36:14] <hemangpatel> in  forefox when i refresh page it alert... but i dont want it..
[08:37:46] <bdc> I don't really condone the usage of alert(), but I'll assume you're just using that as a debugging example.
[08:38:55] <hemangpatel> i need it in chat application ... so i can alert the user that he/she now offile..
[08:39:09] <bdc> but yes, onUnload fires if the pages is refreshed, or the back button is clicked, or the window/tab is closed.
[08:41:30] <hemangpatel> bdc : then whats the solution ? :(
[08:43:08] <bdc> I still don't see the point. If I'm in your chat application, and I close my browser, then of course I'm offline. I don't want a modal pop-up telling me that.
[08:44:22] <erebel55> yeah popups suck
[08:44:32] <hemangpatel> bdc : but i want to display alert box to warn him..
[08:45:10] <bdc> no, you don't want to do that.
[08:46:08] <BinaryKitten> hemangpatel is it mission critical that you warn the user that they are leaving the site, that they are not able to chat anymore?
[08:46:32] <BinaryKitten> because as most people have said, most people will get that already
[08:47:19] <BinaryKitten> by all means if there is a message for someone in the queue etc .. warn the user at that point "Are you sure you wish to leave .. there is a message in the queue" blah
[08:47:47] <BinaryKitten> but for most of the time, you do not want to be blocking the user's decisions with pointless alerts or confirmations.
[08:48:41] <hemangpatel> BinaryKitten : but i want to do that..anyother external js works ?
[08:48:56] <bdc> User experience issues aside, AFAIK from a technical perspective, there isn't really a way to distinguish between tab/window closed, back button clicked, or page was refreshed.  They are all "onUnload".
[08:49:29] <BinaryKitten> agreed bdc there is no way to detect the difference
[08:49:43] <hemangpatel> can i remove that F5 event code from unload ?
[08:49:55] <BinaryKitten> hemangpatel nope
[08:50:07] <BinaryKitten> you can only respond to events
[08:50:33] <BinaryKitten> you can't prevent events from being fired by system
[08:50:53] <hemangpatel> ok. thanks.
[08:50:55] <BinaryKitten> you can prevent default actions, but only after the event has happened and you are responding to it
[08:51:21] <hemangpatel> i understand .. :D
[08:51:26] <BinaryKitten> cool :)
[08:51:52] <BinaryKitten> bdc :)
[08:52:40] * BinaryKitten decides now is the time that the freezer must be ransacked. For it be the time to EAT!

[09:02:01] <erebel55> lol
[09:02:19] <erebel55> can svg's be used with context menu as well?
[09:02:21] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/6/
[09:09:26] <bdc> erebel55 you mean putting an svg inside of the contextMenu? Don't see why not...
[09:11:19] <erebel55> no, i'm just trying to right click off an svg and bring up a context menu
[09:11:38] <erebel55> for right now
[09:14:01] <diegoviola> is it possible to draw vector graphics with jquery svg or raphael on top of a png image? like this: http://ompldr.org/vZDIwag -- i need to be able to highlight parts of that image and display popups on focus, etc
[09:14:06] <diegoviola> or should i just use a svg image for everything?
[09:14:29] <bdc> I've never used contextMenu actually, but I have done the same thing putting tooltips on svg elements (specifically, on rect nodes inside sag's, etc).
[09:15:10] <erebel55> ahh ok
[09:15:28] <erebel55> from the examples, I'm going off of. my code "should" work.
[09:16:10] <adept-phil> diegoviola: I guess in theory you could position the svg element over the png image using rel / abs positioning & z-index?
[09:17:14] <Advocated> I don't know if this is a browser or css thing, but i've got a form inside a jquery dialog/div and on the bottom right hand side there are 3 diagonal lines, which are used to resize i can only assume. Can css be used to turn this off or is it a browser thing?
[09:17:30] <diegoviola> adept-phil: yeah makes sense, my worry is in the implementation part, browser support, etc
[09:17:51] <adept-phil> Advocated: resize:false in your dialog() options
[09:17:57] <diegoviola> adept-phil: i.e. if i give absolute positioning to the svg elements, won't they look different in another browser, etc?
[09:18:24] <adept-phil> diegoviola: Shouldn't be an issue really as long as the browser supports svg. I dunno, guess you will need to try and see what results you get
[09:18:37] <diegoviola> adept-phil: yeah thanks
[09:18:57] <adept-phil> Advocated: Sorry it's actually resizable: false
[09:19:51] <Advocated> adept-phil, cheers! all done
[09:19:59] <adept-phil> Advocated: so you end up with something like $('#elementId').dialog({autoOpen: true, resizable: false,})
[09:20:04] <adept-phil> Advocated: sweet :D
[09:20:43] <Advocated> One further thing is: $("#dialog-form").dialog("option", "position", [position.left, position.top + 100])  is what im using, instead of specifying the top/left is there a way I can get it to show at the bottom of a div position or something?
[09:23:16] <bdc> erebel55 Element ID: ' + $(e1).attr('id') = '\n\n' +
[09:23:32] <bdc> erebel55 what's up with that =
[09:23:52] <jcp_> jquery ui isn't filtering through the objects returned via jsonâ€¦ it's just spitting all of them out. am i doing something wrong here? http://pastebin.com/mesK5s7U
[09:24:08] <erebel55> bdc: sorry that's a typo should be a +
[09:24:12] <erebel55> thanks for catching that
[09:24:58] <adept-phil> Advocated: If you know the position you want to place it you can asign that in the position option as you are above. Simply put the xPos & yPos you want it to appear. You can find the offset() or position() of other elements and then position it relative to their position.
[09:25:36] <erebel55> fixed, two typos http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/8/
[09:26:20] <erebel55> i just noticed the edit/cut/copy are showing up at the bottom of the page
[09:26:21] <Advocated> adept-phil, ok thanks will have a play
[09:29:46] <bdc> Um, eregel55.. you commented out the script tag for contextMenu.js, so it's not actually loading on jsfiddle.
[09:30:16] <erebel55> ahh, I wasn't sure how that actually worked on jsfiddle when using jQuery
[09:30:59] <bdc> I'm not sure either, but you can verify by using the console and check $.fn.contextMenu  (it is undefined)
[09:31:45] <erebel55> ahh ok thank you
[09:32:37] <adept-phil> erebel55: You're always best to add it as a resource in jsfiddle on the left hand side menu :D
[09:32:42] <bdc> so that doesn't solve your problem :) but at least we know the stuff jsfiddle isn't working
[09:32:55] <adept-phil> Things like JS files & CSS you can add and forget about adding the <script> tags :D
[09:32:59] <erebel55> bdc: right, good to know the correct way of doing things tho
[09:33:09] <erebel55> adept-phil: thank you :)
[09:33:24] <adept-phil> erebel55 & bdc, you guys need ahand?
[09:33:26] <adept-phil> a hand?
[09:34:01] <erebel55> yeah, would be much appreciated :)
[09:34:16] <adept-phil> what's up?
[09:34:30] <adept-phil> is this still the context menu / svg thingy?
[09:34:44] <erebel55> yes, trying to get the context menu to show up when right click on svg
[09:34:51] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/9/
[09:34:54] <erebel55> is what I have right now
[09:35:15] <erebel55> its showing up at the bottom of the page all the time for some reason, and is just the list..not a context menu
[09:36:08] <adept-phil> erebel, where are the css and js files located?
[09:36:08] <bdc> I think it's still not loading contextMenu, try using the resources thing on the left that adept-phil recommended.
[09:36:27] <erebel55> ok, i'll try that
[09:36:38] <erebel55> adept-phil: i'm just using the .js and .css provided by jquery
[09:36:46] <adept-phil> erebel55: jsfiddle will be looking for local versions of jquery.contextMenu.js and jquery.contextMenu.css. They fail in my NET panel in FireBu
[09:37:33] <adept-phil> have you got hosted versions for the purpose of this test?
[09:37:44] <erebel55> ahh no I don't
[09:37:58] <adept-phil> okies :D
[09:39:06] <adept-phil> 1st thing to do then is to get a version of each hosted so we can include them in the jsfiddle resources. Simply upload them or find a cdn version somewhere :) Are they your own files or are they pre-written libraries?
[09:39:25] <erebel55> they are pre-written, i found some links
[09:39:26] <adept-phil> And you can you this site too... http://www.cdnjs.com
[09:39:53] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/10/
[09:39:58] <erebel55> thanks for the linky
[09:39:58] <adept-phil> the link I have just sent is a kinda open source CDN for JS libraries. If you upload them to there you should be able to use them in jsfiddle
[09:40:15] <adept-phil> np's :D
[09:40:46] <systemclient> I'd like to do something either when some animation finishes or an ajax request succeeds. How can I only have the later function actually call the callback?
[09:40:46] <adept-phil> great! That's loaded perfectly now fella!
[09:41:01] <erebel55> :) now the list doesn't show up at the bottom all the time at least
[09:41:14] <bdc> erebel55 you should probably always have your console open
[09:41:19] <bdc> Element ID: ' + $(e1).attr('id') = '\n\n' +
[09:41:25] <bdc> oops
[09:41:31] <bdc> 'X: ' + pos.docX + ' Y: ' + pos.docY: ' (relative to document)'
[09:41:42] <smango> What's the difference between say find("> li") and find("li")? (it's hard to Google '>')
[09:41:44] <bdc> You have a trailing : after docY
[09:42:02] <erebel55> bdc: thanks, I will use my console for now on :) sorry i'm very new to web dev
[09:43:34] <bdc> The dev tools in chrome or firebug are awesome.  Use them :)  It will let you find silly mistakes like that instantly, instead of banging your head on the keyboard trying to figure out why things are failing.
[09:44:02] <adept-phil> erebel55: Here's a very handy link for you then :D
[09:44:04] <adept-phil> www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/javascript-debugging-beginners
[09:44:07] <erebel55> yeah, wow this is nice, i'm naturally a application programmer. this gives me more of a "compiler" approach i'm used to
[09:44:10] <erebel55> thanks adept-phil
[09:44:19] * adept-phil +1's bdc's comment
[09:44:53] <donal> hi all
[09:44:55] <adept-phil> erebel55: well that tutorial teaches you how to set breakpoints etc. Very handy for checking var / object values during runtime
[09:45:02] <adept-phil> hi donal
[09:45:09] <erebel55> wow yeah thanks a ton
[09:45:51] <donal> I have elements like this on the page <a href="#" onclick="$(someSelectorHere.show();)">Add</a><div class="addPerformerForm" style="display: none"></div>
[09:46:19] <donal> when I click on the <a> I want the <div> that is a sibling of it to be shown
[09:46:46] <systemclient> bdc: +1 on dev-tools!
[09:46:50] <donal> but not all divs with the 'addPerformerClass', only that which is a sibling of the <a>
[09:46:53] <erebel55> wooot http://jsfiddle.net/LZrML/14/   got it working :D thanks for all the tips and help guys
[09:48:26] <adept-phil> glad you got it sorted erebel55. It's a good channel here so come back :D
[09:48:40] <adept-phil> you tend to learn as well ;)
[09:48:55] <erebel55> yeah, I will def stick around
[09:49:04] <bdc> erebel55 *cheers*
[09:49:38] <adept-phil> donal You want to use something like <a href="#" onclick="$(this).children('div').show();)">
[09:49:58] <adept-phil> sorry, sibling, not children
[09:50:02] <donal> adept-phil, I'm trying to make a jsfiddle to demo the problem, back in a sec.....
[09:53:24] <adept-phil> donal: http://jsfiddle.net/philwilliams81/FqD94/
[09:53:49] <donal> here's my effort http://jsfiddle.net/79wHy/1/
[09:54:50] <donal> <adept-phil> your example doesn't seem to work, when I click on Add I see nothing
[09:55:21] <adept-phil> I posted the old link by mistake...
[09:55:27] <adept-phil> donal: http://jsfiddle.net/philwilliams81/FqD94/1/ :D
[09:55:32] <bdc> donal in your <a> tag "this" is the <a> tag. It has no children.
[09:56:20] <donal> thanks bdc and adept-phil, I have seen the error of my ways
[09:56:32] <adept-phil> donal on the example I have showed I have taken the onlcick out of the <a> and placed it within the JS itself
[09:56:35] <bdc> oh right, phil said children, but he meant to say siblings.
[09:56:56] <adept-phil> I corrected myself bdc ;) keep up fella :D
[09:57:02] <donal> ha
[09:57:14] * adept-phil slides a double espresso to bdc
[09:57:57] <bdc> I saw you corrected it, but it was still children in the fiddle :)
[10:07:20] <Layke> Is jQuery AMD loadable?
[10:08:05] <adept-phil> don't quite get you Layke? Could you explain more?
[10:08:42] <Layke> I'm trying to lload jQuery throguh asyncronous loading. (AMD). But I noticed that on CDN, jQuery isn't written in a AMD friendly format.
[10:09:08] <c00kiemon5ter> hi all
[10:09:35] <adept-phil> what reason do you need to load it asyncronously? I've never needed to and I'm curious :D
[10:09:42] <adept-phil> hi c00kiemon5ter
[10:10:15] <c00kiemon5ter> I'm using lavalamp for a menu, but I can see that lavalamp uses li.current . I use github-pages to host a site, and when I click a link on the menu, the whole pages reload and the menu-item loses the .current class.
[10:10:35] <c00kiemon5ter> can I go around this ?
[10:10:38] <diegoviola> how can i find coordinates of a png image?
[10:10:39] <diegoviola> please
[10:11:01] <adept-phil> diegoviola look at .offset() and .position()
[10:11:28] <c00kiemon5ter> I thought may I can use url/foo.html#foo and have each menu-item have an id, and thus do some jquery and add the class .current to the menu-item with that id
[10:11:31] <adept-phil> c00kiemon5ter do you have an exmaple?
[10:11:33] <diegoviola> adept-phil: ty
[10:11:44] <adept-phil> diegoviola: yw
[10:11:57] <c00kiemon5ter> do you want to see the site I build ? :P
[10:12:02] <Layke> adept-phil, jQuery is just an after thought. I'm actually running Dojo, which I load entirely Async. BEcause I build all of my files into a single minified.js (it's like 300kb~ for the entire application), I have all of my modules in there. And a few other jQuery plugins. Being able to get jQuery AMD'loadable would just simplify things
[10:12:27] <adept-phil> Layke: gethca. Have you looked at requireJS?
[10:12:46] <Layke> Yeah, that's what I'm using, (at least a fork of it iirc)
[10:12:49] <adept-phil> c00kiemon5ter: I don't mind! It's just useful to see the problem to be able to offer solutions :D
[10:13:09] <c00kiemon5ter> adept-phil: http://c00kiemon5ter.github.com/tsoukalas/
[10:13:11] <adept-phil> Layke: ok. I'll look into it for you :D
[10:13:33] <Layke> It's just when I'm doing something like define( ["jquery"], function( jquery) {} ), because jquery isn't declared properly.. my definitions don't work.
[10:13:47] <adept-phil> Layke: The reason I ask is that I think requireJS loads jquery asynchronously, so it may be helpful to see how they do it :)
[10:13:55] <c00kiemon5ter> adept-phil: the top menu, with the little car, click Î•Ï€Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½Î¯Î± and see it stays there, until the page reloads
[10:14:19] <adept-phil> c00kiemon5ter: I'm using MiRC for my chat client :)
[10:15:05] <adept-phil> Layke: ingore that, requireJS loads jQuery using <script>
[10:15:47] <adept-phil> Layke: ingore that, I have no idea how requireJS actually loads jquery lol
[10:16:20] <adept-phil> Layke: just looked at it myself and if I'm honest I've never used it and don't really know how it works
[10:17:14] <Layke> It's a  jquery problem on my side. I either 1) Need to stop using CDN and modify jquery. 2) Find a Google CDN version that is AMD'ified. 3) Just load jquery beforee </body> and live with it
[10:18:48] <bdc> c00kiemon5ter I click on Î•Ï€Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½Î¯Î± and the car zooms back to the left (unless I hover my mouse over Î•Ï€Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½Î¯Î±). What is the intended behavior?
[10:19:11] <c00kiemon5ter> bdc: no, it is supposed to stay on Î•Ï€Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½Î¯Î±
[10:19:35] <c00kiemon5ter> bdc: it seems it loses the menu-items lose the .current class
[10:19:42] <c00kiemon5ter> that lavalamp uses internally
[10:20:03] <adept-phil> Layke: Will this help?
[10:20:06] <adept-phil> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2287-Using-jQuery-As-A-Named-Module-In-RequireJS.htm
[10:20:08] <c00kiemon5ter> and I think that's because the whole page reloads
[10:20:15] <c00kiemon5ter> github pages is just static html pages
[10:21:58] <Layke> Yeah but that's not the behaviour I'm getting.
[10:22:33] <Layke> $.fn hasn't been initialized for me, by the time that the callback has fired.
[10:22:36] <Layke> Not sure why.
[10:23:08] <adept-phil> Layke: I'm no help I'm affraid, it's a little beyond my knowledge :)
[10:23:29] <Layke> Yeah don't worry. :) I'm just looking for perfection. I know how to hack my way around the issue
[10:23:38] <adept-phil> $.fn being what?
[10:24:59] <Layke> Where I plan on populating the jQuery custom plugin I need.
[10:25:21] <Layke> I actually use Dojo. I just want to also use some jquery plugin as well.
[10:25:32] <adept-phil> ah ok
[10:25:53] <adept-phil> how do you like DoJoDojo? I've never looked at it to be honest. How does it fair?
[10:27:01] <bdc> c00kiemon5ter I cannot debug minified code. Can you make a version with human readable code?
[10:27:03] <diegoviola> i wonder if i can display things like popups based on image coordinates, e.g. when i position the mouse pointer on top of certain image, without using things like <map>, is such thing possible?
[10:27:47] <smango> Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can use jquery to set the source of an image based on the anchor in a url?
[10:28:06] <adept-phil> diegoviola: You can assign an event to an element and on mouse-move check the current co-ords defined in say an array and then act on what conidtion is returned
[10:28:07] <Layke> It's different to jQuery. Dojo also has a much steeper learning curve to do things correctly. but it has stuff that I couldn't do without. You generally know which you want to use for a project too.
[10:28:25] <aqeel> hi room
[10:28:28] <adept-phil> smangon: use .attr('src')
[10:28:46] <aqeel> how to implement a wrap.....can i use short hand?
[10:29:02] <aqeel> wrap("<div>")
[10:29:05] <adept-phil> smango: Sorry, I misread your problem
[10:29:08] <diegoviola> adept-phil: cool, thanks
[10:29:17] <c00kiemon5ter> bdc: sure, http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/23/lavalamp-for-jquery-lovers/ this the plugin's homepage, here's the download link: http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/lavalamp/js/jquery.lavalamp.js
[10:29:20] <aqeel> and it wraps the div within the speciified container
[10:30:32] <bdc> jQuery is a library that makes life much more pleasant, Dojo is a framework for building OO apps in javascript.  They aren't really comparable.
[10:30:46] <adept-phil> smango: Do you want to get the image's src or extract an image path from the page url?
[10:31:34] <adept-phil> bdc: getcha. I'm a PHP dev and I'll be looking into a few JS MVC frameworks soon. I'll give that a go ;)
[10:32:57] <adept-phil> aqeel: not sure if there's an easy way, but you could grab the element you wish to wrap, replace it in the DOM with the element you want to wrap around it, and then place the wrapped element back into the DOM within the 'wrap' element
[10:33:31] <niclick> hi!
[10:33:50] <adept-phil> aqeel: hang on, just discovered jqueries .wrap(). Just looking at it now :)
[10:33:52] <adept-phil> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[10:34:09] <adept-phil> aqeel: Bingo , that's your answer, http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[10:34:44] <adept-phil> aqeel: $(selector).wrap(content);
[10:35:17] <dns-away> how i can check object if empty
[10:35:56] <adept-phil> dns-away, I think typeof will help, not too sure, or object.length?
[10:36:37] <aqeel> thanks
[10:36:41] <adept-phil> diegoviola: This might help http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/imagemapster-interactive-image-maps-with-jquery/
[10:36:52] <dns-away> Jquery say: No. That would work on arrays, but objects don't have a length property (by default).
[10:37:46] <adept-phil> dns-away, well you learn something new every day. Are you checking the object has been created or that it's empty?
[10:38:14] <diegoviola> adept-phil: thanks a bunch
[10:39:26] <adept-phil> dns-away?
[10:39:31] <dns-away> moment
[10:41:56] <adept-phil> dns-away: No worries. I typically check: if( typeof myObject !='undefined' ) { /* do this */ }
[10:42:11] <adept-phil> dns-away: but that only checks it's creation
[10:42:44] <adept-phil> dns-away: I then use method functions for anything else
[10:42:51] <dns-away> ok, thanks will try
[10:43:15] <adept-phil> sorry class functions
[10:43:46] <smango> adept-phil: taking a step back, what I'm trying to do as a simple learning project is create a simple image gallery script, where I have a list of image thumbnails and then clicking one sets the div next to them to contain the larger version of that image, if that makes sense
[10:44:42] <adept-phil> smango: Sure. How are you generating your gallery? PHP?
[10:45:33] <smango> yeah
[10:46:32] <c00kiemon5ter> bdc: any idea what could be going wrong ?
[10:46:45] <adept-phil> smango: great, well your app needs to do one thing really. Change an image based on the thumbnail clicked, which means that you're going to need to get the correct filename of the image you want to show
[10:47:03] <adept-phil> smango: How are you diferentiating your thumbs / images? By filename or folder location?
[10:47:47] <adept-phil> eg: folder/image-01_full.jpg / folder/image-01_thumb.jpg  ... or
[10:48:15] <adept-phil> folder/full/image-01.jpg / folder/thumbs/image-01.jpg
[10:49:30] <adept-phil> smango?
[10:51:44] <dns-away> adept-phil, can you check here - http://jsfiddle.net/5LEFG/
[10:52:32] <adept-phil> dns-away: Sure 1 sec
[10:53:04] <adept-phil> ok, what's wrong?
[10:54:30] <smango> adept-phil: sorry. I'm differentiating them by folder currently (like images/a.jpg vs thumbs/a.jpg) but i can easily change that if it makes the jquery implementation easier
[10:55:14] <adept-phil> dns-away: I think what you're expecting is an alert once people enter a mistake and then correct it. It will never happen as the object is creted on the first iteration. You might want to create the object on the first error
[10:55:19] <dns-away> adept-phil, no have alert('ok'), if username exist
[10:55:37] <adept-phil> smango not at all, 2 secs fella and I'll explain everything
[10:56:22] <adept-phil> dns-away, because you create the error object at the start of your function and never populate it (if the form submission is valid). Later on you check the object exists, which it will always do since you create it at the start
[10:56:52] <adept-phil> dns-away: You may just want to use an array in this instance?
[10:57:15] <adept-phil> then you can use length as well as typeof to get 2x results for empty / created
[10:57:42] <dns-away> can you suggest me how i can create array ?
[10:57:44] <adept-phil> objects aren't usefull for simply holding textual data. If you have functions for setting / getting info then sure, objects are the way
[10:58:05] <dns-away> ok
[10:58:34] <dns-away> How i can create array with $('#custom').val() 's
[10:59:35] <imanc> I need to set up a a tool tip to a live event,e .g.  $('.top').tooltip();   but there's no specific action associated with it.  Do I just leave the event field blank with .live()?
[10:59:39] <dns-away> Array[1] ='..'
[10:59:42] <dns-away> Array[2] ='..'
[10:59:57] <dns-away> correctly ?
[11:01:22] <aqeel> $("p").wrap("<div class=\"fixie\"><div>");
[11:01:32] <aqeel> this not wrappng every p element?
[11:02:27] <imanc> aqeel: try using $.each, e.g $("p").each( function() {  $(this).wrap() });
[11:02:44] <aqeel> ok
[11:06:28] <adept-phil> dns-away: try this http://jsfiddle.net/5LEFG/1/
[11:06:54] <mrbrdo> I'm retrieving some data from the server with $.post, and my callback function *usually* gets a string in the data arg (html in the string), but in some cases I get a Document object (or thats how console.log shows it in Chrome), this is messing things up for me. Any idea what the deal is here?
[11:07:15] <adept-phil> smango: Right, well there are a few ways you can do this. You can bind an event to each thumbnail and then grab the thumbnaiols src and modify that using a string replacement and then with the new src assign that to full sized image's src attr, or you can ouput the images filename as a data-attr in your php, pull this when the thumb is clicked and then use JS to append the correct filepath and
[11:07:15] <adept-phil> again change the full sized images src attr...  Does this make sense?
[11:07:22] <mrbrdo> i.e. in chrome i see Document, which I can expand and then I see the html code
[11:07:51] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: are you expecting html content or JSON back from the back-end?
[11:08:29] <mrbrdo> adept-phil html
[11:08:54] <adept-phil> and you're getting a document object returned?
[11:09:06] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: I think I'm missing something here lol
[11:09:08] <mrbrdo> adept-phil although i have to be honest that my server only sets content-type http header to "; charset=utf-8"
[11:09:20] <mrbrdo> adept-phil the server just returns raw html
[11:09:33] <mrbrdo> adept-phil however in my callback in $.post i get this object for some reason
[11:09:41] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: in that case I'm not fully understanding your problem?
[11:10:07] <mrbrdo> adept-phil the responses from the server are basically the same, just return different html
[11:10:15] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: have you got example code to put in a jsfiddle?
[11:10:18] <smango> adept-phil: yeah, let me experiment and see if I can work out how to do that (still new to jquery/js)
[11:10:19] <mrbrdo> adept-phil in one case the html is accessibe as a string to me from the data param of my callback
[11:10:34] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: yeah I'm struggling figuring out where you get an object returned from?
[11:10:36] <mrbrdo> adept-phil not really its part of a bigger project :S i was just hoping for some pointers
[11:11:02] <mrbrdo> adept-phil: $.post(url, params, function(data <--- here
[11:11:05] <adept-phil> smango: Goto jsfiddle.net. It's great for playing about. If you need a hnad give me a shout :)
[11:11:32] <adept-phil> ahhh getcha.
[11:11:51] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: So what exaclty is the problem you've got?
[11:11:51] <niclick> how I can add a class
[11:12:01] <adept-phil> .addClass() perhaps?
[11:12:24] <niclick> oh really nice y start learning jQuery :9
[11:12:33] <smango> adept-phil: will do, thanks :)
[11:12:42] <mrbrdo> adept-phil the problem is that when i get this Document object, i can't insert that into DOM, because i get a DOM error 3
[11:13:04] <mrbrdo> adept-phil: which seems to mean that im giving it invalid data which i understand since it should be a string, not a Document object
[11:13:26] <mrbrdo> however the Document object seems to contain the html string
[11:13:35] <adept-phil> smango: basically its a little playground for messing about with HTML, JS and CSS. You can create a basic set up in there and then share it to others who can help you with issues. Definitely worth learning :)
[11:13:46] <JoeyCadle> Anyone come into a problem where on mobile-safari (iphone/ipad) a simple show/hide of a hidden element will cause the font contained to become larger?
[11:13:56] <mrbrdo> smplstk: actually, i think the document object contains parsed html (dom objects) while in the first case i just have a shtml string
[11:13:59] <adept-phil> have you got exaple's mrbrdo?
[11:13:59] <mrbrdo> html string*
[11:14:36] <mrbrdo> i can only give you both of the htmls returned by the server (one gets parsed as string and one as Document object)
[11:14:39] <mrbrdo> would that suffice?
[11:14:58] <mrbrdo> you can do a $.get on a static file with that html inside to test
[11:15:40] <adept-phil> not really, the problem won't be the response from the server however it will be how the response is handled. I 'think' that your repsonse using $.post() is always an object wrapping the html response
[11:16:12] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: just reading the doc now. I've never used $.post()
[11:16:30] <dns-away> adept-phil thank you!
[11:16:51] <mrbrdo> adept-phil i don't think so. in the first case its just a string of html data
[11:16:53] <hattorihanzo> hey, is there a irc room for jqTouch?
[11:17:09] <mrbrdo> adept-phil this is the data http://pastie.org/3616361 the http headers are the same in both cases
[11:17:13] <hattorihanzo> or anyone here have decent exp. with jqtouch?
[11:17:27] <adept-phil> dns-away no worries. It's not ideal however it should get you started
[11:17:47] <adept-phil> hattorihanzo: not me sorry
[11:18:25] <imanc> hattorihanzo: there's #jquerymobile, I haven't looked for a jqtouch chan
[11:18:36] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: are they supposed to be identical (including content?)
[11:18:42] <dwarder> why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/9yhrP/
[11:18:48] <mrbrdo> adept-phil what do you mean?
[11:18:54] <hattorihanzo> yea, i've built stuff with jqmobile, but like the performance in jqTouch better
[11:18:59] <mrbrdo> adept-phil it is correct that the content is different, of course
[11:20:04] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: response 1 seems to be a list of 10 items with a pagination div at the end and the other seems to be a single item listing. I'd compare the same output from the same back-end service to eliminate other possible reasons :D
[11:20:28] <mrbrdo> adept-phil what are you talking about?
[11:20:36] <mrbrdo> adept-phil what does it matter what the actual data is?
[11:20:40] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: let me explain
[11:20:54] <mrbrdo> adept-phil in both cases its html and in one case jquery gives me a string and in the other case it gives me a Document object
[11:21:02] <dns-away> adept-phil, one more please
[11:21:12] <dns-away> how will work here with multiple check's
[11:21:13] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/95TwH/
[11:21:14] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: Are them responses experienced on the same browser?
[11:21:30] <dwarder> i guess 'doesn't work' isn't a good question
[11:21:35] <mrbrdo> adept-phil yes
[11:21:41] <mrbrdo> adept-phil same server same browser
[11:21:51] <dwarder> why radio button value in't filled into my debug div http://jsfiddle.net/9yhrP/
[11:21:54] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: right, from two seperate responses from 2x seperate back-end functions?
[11:22:13] <mrbrdo> adept-phil its the same function just returning different data based on query params
[11:22:35] <adept-phil> right, the ajax mathod to get that data, is that the same method in each case?
[11:22:38] <mrbrdo> adept-phil and response 1 always gets parsed as string and response 2 ALWAYS gets parsed as Document object
[11:22:49] <mrbrdo> yes it's the same exact line in code
[11:23:04] <adept-phil> right, now I fully understand.
[11:23:14] <dwarder> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/9yhrP/
[11:23:16] <adept-phil> Can you do a pastie / jsfiddle for that calling function ?
[11:23:28] <dwarder> there are 3 lines of code
[11:23:53] <mrbrdo> adept-phil http://pastie.org/3616413
[11:23:55] <adept-phil> dns-away: I've helped you get where you are fella, you can work it out with a little thinking. Have a stab at it and give me a shout when I'm finished with mrbrdo and I'll give you a hand
[11:24:05] <mrbrdo> adept-phil its from a rails project but thats just to get the url
[11:24:56] <dns-away> thank you
[11:24:58] <dns-away> :)
[11:25:48] <mrbrdo> adept-phil: okay i guess for some reason jquery interprets one as html and the other one as XML
[11:26:01] <mrbrdo> adept-phil i've added the dataType parameter as html and it works fine now
[11:26:17] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: I don't know if this will make a difference, but you're not telling jquery what your expecting the response to actually be so it may be assigning the reponse as an obj or a string by itself
[11:26:18] <adept-phil> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:26:47] <mrbrdo> yeah, it's the dataType param
[11:27:03] <mrbrdo> i think it may work properly also if i set the HTTP headers more properly (content-type)
[11:27:04] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: I personally use $.ajax({dataType: json}) or $.ajax({dataType: html}) to specifically define what I Expect my response to be
[11:27:06] <mrbrdo> but anyway, works now
[11:27:21] <mrbrdo> dont u need to quote 'json' and 'html'
[11:27:23] <adept-phil> was my suggestion helpful?
[11:27:33] <mrbrdo> yep thanks
[11:28:07] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: yeah of course you do, sorry I was typing quickly :D
[11:28:11] <imanc> is livequery still maintained?
[11:28:21] <adept-phil> mrbrdo: Glad I helped :D
[11:28:34] <adept-phil> dns-away: Show me what you have so far fella
[11:28:51] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/95TwH/ :/
[11:29:03] <dns-away> two checking no work
[11:30:18] <adept-phil> dns, ok well you can do a few things. Firstly put all your form elements within a form so you can target that specific form and it's form elements as well. Give me a shout when you've done that
[11:32:10] <dwarder> can anyone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/9yhrP/ please
[11:32:22] <adept-phil> dwarder: looking now. Whats up?
[11:33:08] <dwarder> adept-phil: well, debug isn't filled with the checked radio button value
[11:33:18] <dwarder> upon click
[11:34:55] <dwarder> adept-phil: do you, by any chance, know what could cause the problem
[11:35:32] <foo> I'm trying to simulate a scratcher (eg. like a lotto ticket you scratch). I'd like to have it so this image is #f00, but when you click on it, it reveals the image: http://jsfiddle.net/Jwymw/ - any tips on how to do this?
[11:37:08] <raj> BinaryKitten, still around?
[11:37:31] <dwarder> adept-phil: maybe a small hint that could allude me what is wrong with it
[11:37:47] <dns-away> adept-phil this is one. only password and username http://jsfiddle.net/95TwH/
[11:39:17] <adept-phil> dwarder: to start you're missing ); at the end ;)
[11:39:31] <adept-phil> dns-away: two secs ;)
[11:39:46] <dns-away> :)
[11:40:11] <adept-phil> dwarder: also remove the @ in your input selector ;)
[11:40:19] <adept-phil> dwarder: then it works

[11:40:43] <adept-phil> dwarder: nps
[11:41:15] <adept-phil> dns-away: looking now
[11:41:24] <dns-away> ahm
[11:41:48] <adept-phil> dns-away: you got the most recent jsfiddle?
[11:43:06] <dns-away> sorry, no understand your question
[11:43:16] <dispyfree113> Hi
[11:43:25] <dns-away> here http://jsfiddle.net/5LEFG/1/ and new is here http://jsfiddle.net/95TwH/
[11:43:27] <dns-away> :]
[11:43:30] <dns-away> if talk for it
[11:43:34] <dns-away> hello
[11:43:42] <adept-phil> thanks :)
[11:44:05] <adept-phil> dns-away: the latest doesn't have the <form>?.. have you clicked 'update'?
[11:44:14] <dispyfree113> I'm using jQuery's drag & drop facility. what can be the hassle if I drop one div above another but no drop actually happens? Must every div to be dropped into be bigger than the divs to be droped into it ?
[11:44:50] <adept-phil> dispyfree113: check the tolerance option on droppable :)
[11:44:54] <dispyfree113> Ive checked it: the droppable-behavior is applied to the div to be dropped into
[11:44:59] <dns-away> Yes, adept-phil please put text only in first input box and check username2 no work
[11:45:00] <dispyfree113> ah, one moment
[11:45:02] <adept-phil> change it to pointer and you should be ok
[11:45:41] <adept-phil> dns-away: You misunderstand... Wrap the <input> fields inside a <form> and then get back to me
[11:46:16] <dns-away> ok
[11:46:52] <adept-phil> dispyfree113: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#options
[11:47:44] <adept-phil> dispyfree113: tolerance has a few options. Pointer means that as long as the mouse pointer is over the droppable element when dropped then it will fire. By default the centers of both elements need to be identical to fire
[11:48:09] <adept-phil> dispyfree113: it had me stuck for ages a few weeks back
[11:48:14] <erebel55> hm i have an svg that contains a rect and an image. I want it to open the context menu when right click on any part of the svg (meaning rect or image). but for some reason it doesn't load up when right click on image right now. http://jsfiddle.net/p3vq5/8/
[11:48:30] <dispyfree113> ah. saved my day @adept-phil ;) thank you verym uch :)
[11:48:37] <dns-away> adept-phil i no need <form> in my site
[11:48:41] <dns-away> its is only ajax input :-)
[11:49:07] <adept-phil> dns-away, I will explain, just stick it in a form for now please :)
[11:49:23] <dns-away> thanks
[11:49:24] <dns-away> okay
[11:49:25] <dns-away> :]
[11:49:31] <adept-phil> eg <form id="login-form>
[11:49:55] <adept-phil> then we can use $('#login-form').submit(); and handle our validation and submission in there ;)
[11:50:17] <adept-phil> dispyfree113: No problems fella!
[11:50:31] <dns-away> here is up-date :-)

[11:58:09] <erebel55> anyone have any ideas?
[12:12:04] <adept-phil> hi erebel55, whats up?
[12:12:44] <erebel55> hey i just realized i was stupid and didn't add for a check with myIMage
[12:12:53] <erebel55> i mean i didn't give the image an id
[12:15:18] <adept-phil> whats the problem? or have you sorted it?
[12:16:03] <erebel55> I think i'm sorting it out. I'll ask in a min if i can't
[12:16:06] <erebel55> :)
[12:17:53] <ragnok> hello, i'm learning jquery and webkit dev tools to debug jquery code. How can i see the code of something written with jquery? if i right click, and inspect element, and then click on the scripts tab, i have the jquery minified lib, not the custom code....
[12:18:42] <css> wut
[12:19:26] <erebel55> figured it out :D thanks tho adept-phil
[12:19:37] <ragnok> i cannot find the jquery code of a certain thing moving on screen
[12:19:44] <css> You're looking to trace the original jQuery code from the div it controls? o_O
[12:19:56] <ragnok> css, yes, preciselly
[12:20:40] <ragnok> is that impossible?
[12:20:41] <css> That's not really how it works
[12:20:45] <ragnok> ahhh
[12:20:53] <css> It's not like CSS
[12:20:57] <ragnok> tell me how it works then, i'm eager to now
[12:21:06] <ragnok> know*
[12:21:31] <coj> you can switch the source js file being inspected in Firebug
[12:21:55] <ragnok> yes, i know i can switch, but there's so many, and i never know the correct one
[12:22:39] <coj> not sure then, there may be a way of setting a breakpoint on an element?
[12:22:48] <coj> perhaps with a special extension
[12:24:06] <ragnok> example, if i go to this site http://xpdo.org/, in the very very top, there's a hidden menu ( id="acessibility" ), something is going on there, but i can't find the code
[12:24:41] <systemfault> Chome has a "Break on subtree modification" that can help
[12:25:43] <ragnok> systemfault, that it would be awesome, cauze i'm using chrome
[12:26:01] <systemfault> ragnok: Just right-click on the relevant node
[12:26:18] <ragnok> yes
[12:26:27] <ragnok> on id="acessibility"
[12:27:00] <ragnok> i can actually freeze the state of id="acessibility" with chrome
[12:27:25] <ragnok> like the same way you do with safari
[12:28:50] <coj>  <systemfault> Chome has a "Break on subtree modification" that can help <-- anything like that for firefox?
[12:29:46] <systemfault> I don't know :/
[12:30:02] <ragnok> systemfault, could you please provide a link how to  "Break on subtree modification" in details, cauze i don't really get it :(
[12:30:24] <hattorihanzo> anyone know where jqTouch ppl hang out?
[12:32:12] <ragnok> coj, could you explain me what is "Break on subtree modification"  ?
[12:32:37] <ragnok> ps, i know vanilla js well
[12:32:58] <ragnok> i mean, i just finished codecademy, if that helps
[12:33:50] <systemfault> There's no JS on that page except google analytics..
[12:34:34] <ragnok> whatever, so i took a bad example
[12:35:29] <systemfault> You just right click on the node... select the option.. and now, if you do anything that will trigger a change in the dom subtree, it will break
[12:35:39] <systemfault> So you will know what lines are executed.
[12:35:42] <ragnok> look, i'm versatile with css, and what i do is, every site i go, open the dev tools and inspect, so i learn more, that's what i want to do with the js, that's all
[12:35:56] <css> just look at the js file
[12:35:59] <coj> so you'll be positioned at the line which caused the break, right?
[12:36:31] <raj> I'm trying to abstract the changestateEvent function so I can reuse it, but this seems to break my tree http://paste.ofcode.org/33UEjhkY8nbPxATcLVnSABN
[12:36:38] <coj> css is easy to inspect with dev tools/firebug...js isn't so easy
[12:36:50] <ragnok> systemfault, what do you mean by node?
[12:36:51] <coj> especially if it's obfuscated/minified
[12:37:00] <raj> this happens even if I don't pass `treeclass`
[12:37:11] <coj> node is an element in the DOM
[12:37:31] <systemfault> Like coj said :)
[12:37:41] <ragnok> ahh, ok, a node, a div, and h1 or..an article maybe
[12:37:43] <raj> I'm trying to abstract the changestateEvent function so I can reuse it, but this seems to break my tree http://paste.ofcode.org/5YMwDth8L9sHq8NWr7XSA4
[12:37:46] <raj> (updated)
[12:38:05] <ragnok> article=html5
[12:39:40] <systemfault> ragnok: The browser reads your page.. parse its HTML and creates a "DOM tree"(A datastructure) which is the browser's internal representation of your "html"... any tag, text, comment are DOM nodes within that tree
[12:42:56] <ragnok> systemfault, ok, i got that. it's the unit of something in the DOM tree. when you say:" You just right click on the node... select the option.. " wich option are you refering to?
[12:43:38] <ragnok> got it :
[12:43:40] <ragnok> :D
[12:43:47] <ragnok> break on subtree
[12:43:51] <systemfault> :D
[12:44:13] <ragnok> wicked
[12:44:28] <ragnok> now i can check the js from everywhere i go
[12:45:10] <ragnok> systemfault++
[12:45:15] <ragnok> karma for ya
[12:45:24] <systemfault> :)
[12:50:21] <toocwa> hello :) sorry i got disconnected, my question is above. should be quite a simple one i think!
[12:51:49] <systemfault> If you want your question answered: 1) Ask it 2) Kill your ISP for disconnecting you all the time.

[12:52:13] <donal> hi all
[12:52:22] <donal> I have a set of radio buttons like this:
[12:52:35] <donal> <input id="priority" type="radio" value="HEADLINE" name="priority"/>
[12:52:48] <donal> <input id="priority" type="radio" value="MIDLINE" name="priority">
[12:53:00] <donal> how can I get the value of the selected radio group?
[12:54:21] <donal> sorry, I meant the selected radio *button* ?
[12:56:24] <systemfault> donal: You could try something like $('#my-form input[type="' + radioButtonGroupName + '"]:checked')
[12:56:32] <systemfault> err
[12:56:40] <systemfault> donal: You could try something like $('#my-form input[name="' + radioButtonGroupName + '"]:checked')
[12:56:43] <systemfault> Sorry.
[12:57:58] <donal> do I need to put .val() at the end of that?
[12:58:11] <systemfault> If you want its value, yes
[12:58:17] <donal> i do, thanks a lot
[13:04:22] <valenn> need some help with an error I'm receiving using jsonp
[13:05:14] <valenn> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':' when fetching json data from the server
[13:05:27] <valenn> the json is valid check via jslint
[13:05:39] <systemfault> Then your jq call must be wrong.
[13:06:00] <valenn> wrong in what way?
[13:06:03] <systemfault> And if the json is valid in jslint, there's a problem
[13:06:19] <systemfault> JSONP doesn't return JSON... but javascript
[13:06:45] <toocwa> not sure why freenode keeps kicking me off but the answer to my question was to use $.live(), so found it now, thanks
[13:06:47] <valenn> so how do I get around the cross domain issue
[13:06:54] <systemfault> toocwa: :)
[13:07:07] <systemfault> valenn: JSONP is a way
[13:07:38] <valenn> yeah but when using jsonp I get SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'
[13:08:08] <systemfault> valenn: But the API you call must also support JSONP
[13:08:43] <valenn> That makes sense so the server that I'm hitting does not support jsonp
[13:08:50] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/005eaaf8f3bdd5efcb88  I keep getting "SyntaxError: Unexpected token <" and after googling awhile I'm assuming its an inproper format of my data, but i'm not sure how to fix == any ideas?
[13:09:31] <valenn> can you review my code to make sure that its correct -> https://gist.github.com/2064864
[13:09:32] <systemfault> valenn: Then you might be forced to write a proxy on your server unless the "distant" API support CORS
[13:10:04] <Woet> there is no < in your paste, so the error is not about that piece of code.

[13:10:44] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: but I assume "#{url_for(:controller => opts[:klass].pluralize, :action => :rebuild)}" is PHP code or using another server side language converted?
[13:10:47] <GoGoGarrett> They're talking about whitespace
[13:10:55] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, it's rails
[13:11:12] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: so give us the paste of the actual code rather than server side code

[13:13:39] <atrus6> Is there any way to append to the second to last, instead of just the end of the element?
[13:13:43] <foo> mikkelb: I highly doubt it.
[13:14:04] <mikkelb> damn
[13:14:36] <GoGoGarrett> any idea Woet?
[13:14:46] <adept-phil> mikaelb: good effort :D
[13:15:24] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: still no < in the code besides html/cdata tags

[13:15:42] <mikkelb> adept-phil: well they'd have to pm me for details
[13:15:46] <GoGoGarrett> I'm telling you I don't think it's an actual ">" character
[13:15:48] <mikkelb> but the business plan is solid as hell
[13:15:50] <mikkelb> and
[13:15:51] <GoGoGarrett> stackover flow talks about whitespace instead of tabs
[13:15:56] <GoGoGarrett> on multipule accounts
[13:16:02] <mikkelb> so is the niche
[13:16:19] <GoGoGarrett> I'm just not sure of how to do sanaizatoin on ajax data stuff

[13:16:46] <ragnok>  sanaizatoin lol
[13:17:06] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: What sanitization rules are you looking to apply?

[13:19:04] <Hopsy> ijkl
[13:19:27] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: for a start you have mootools as the JS lib on jsfiddle...
[13:19:33] <Hopsy> GoGoGarrett: what is that!
[13:19:36] <GoGoGarrett> update it now
[13:19:40] <Hopsy> its not working
[13:19:50] <GoGoGarrett> I know.
[13:19:55] <Hopsy> dont paste that anymore then

[13:20:09] <bot-t> GoGoGarrett, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:20:14] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: sorry, 1 min
[13:20:56] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: there is no syntax error on your jsfiddle
[13:21:00] <GoGoGarrett> I know
[13:21:06] <GoGoGarrett> that's why i'm not sure why it's not saving correctly
[13:21:21] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: it is saving correctly, but you are not pasting the code that causes the error.
[13:21:36] * adept-phil +1's Woet's comment
[13:21:45] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: if javascript says unexpected token <, there is a < somewhere it doesn't belong.
[13:21:54] <GoGoGarrett> It's only in chrome
[13:22:09] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: there is no point in pasting random stackoverflow links that clearly state "unexpected token (blank)" or ILLEGAL
[13:22:16] <GoGoGarrett> ff and other browsers just says syntax error, as stated on multipule stackover fow questions
[13:22:22] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett Why do you have the CDATA stuff in your JS?
[13:22:31] <adept-phil> ...hint hint
[13:23:07] <Hopsy> GoGoGarrett: I think your cdata causes all the problem
[13:23:16] <Hopsy> hint hint superhint
[13:24:19] <Woet> works fine for me with his cdata, there is no point in using it but it doesn't cause the issue
[13:24:22] <Woet> at least not on his pastes
[13:24:49] <nickcooley> only reason for him to have CDATA is if he's using xhtml, which we can't tell because we don't see his entire html file
[13:25:19] <Woet> i think we should approach this issue by pasting more unrelated stackoverflow links
[13:25:40] <GoGoGarrett> I'm using haml, but that is irrelevant  because it spits out html.
[13:25:47] <GoGoGarrett> It is related.
[13:25:53] <nickcooley> @GoGoGarrett - with what doctype?
[13:25:58] <GoGoGarrett> htlm5
[13:26:09] <GoGoGarrett> <!DOCTYPE html>
[13:26:14] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett / Woet: was exactly is the problem?
[13:26:16] <nickcooley> yeah, +1 Woet and +1 adept-phil - KILL that CDATA
[13:26:36] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: please highlight me once you've been able to reproduce the issue on jsfiddle
[13:26:39] <GoGoGarrett> The tags are generated dynamically, but that isn't what is causing the problems.
[13:26:54] <Woet> GoGoGarrett: not going to put so much effort into getting you to give useful info
[13:27:04] * Woet goes back to pikmin
[13:28:09] <adept-phil> I see two at least in his JSFiddle.. MooTools is the selected JS lib, and there are no resources defined for .nestedSortable() or .sortable()
[13:29:29] <adept-phil> So god knows what the intended result is or how the results he is getting differ from his expectations. GoGoGarrett: Can you choose the correct JS lib's you are using and add the resources for the external classes so we can help you?
[13:30:39] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/LUyeT/5/
[13:30:50] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/LUyeT/6/ <- sorry
[13:31:29] * Woet starts CPR on his browser
[13:31:30] <GoGoGarrett> drag to the left of the title's
[13:31:46] <erebel55> does anyone know of any examples for handling svg zooming, does jquery have any functions for this? (I aplogize if this is a stupid question)
[13:31:51] <GoGoGarrett> Not sure how to fix the ajax request though
[13:32:05] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: from the begginign.... What are you trying to achieve and how are the results you're getting different?
[13:32:23] <GoGoGarrett> I'm sorting the list of items, and saving the reordered list in the database.
[13:32:34] <GoGoGarrett> It's working for another section of the site, but for some reason this isn't, and I'm unsure why.
[13:33:25] <smares> anyone good with same origin policy? :)
[13:34:21] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: on that last post you have script in the HTML overwritting the stuff in the JS panel. Get rid of what you dont want and repost
[13:34:28] <smares> when doing an ajax call to another domain, is the request "blocked" by the browser or does it simply not parse the response?
[13:34:31] <adept-phil> smares: never heard of it :(
[13:35:01] <smares> and if latter, does it not parse the response body only or headers too?
[13:35:04] <Woet> smares: it is blocked.
[13:35:20] <smares> so the server doesn't even get a request
[13:35:25] <nickcooley> @smares -- are you looking to pass JSON data, because you could try JSONP
[13:35:33] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/LUyeT/7/
[13:35:56] <smares> I am not passing anything. I have to call an URL that doesn't reply any body, but simply does a Set-Cookie
[13:36:21] <Woet> smares: do not use ajax but use something that does allow remote content, such as <img src="" or <script src=""
[13:36:21] <smares> all params are expected as GET params by the server
[13:36:45] <smares> right, that would be my fallback in case ajax doesn't work
[13:36:52] <Woet> smares: time to activate the fallback :)
[13:37:03] <Woet> smares: and return the right mime type so the browser believes it really is an image or js
[13:37:15] <Woet> smares: mime type/content type
[13:37:38] <nickcooley> here's some references based on what Woet's talking about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[13:37:53] <adept-phil> Woet: Is that XXS in effect?
[13:38:13] <adept-phil> nickcooley: Cheers! Wil read that. I was wondering why and thought it may be kinda xss
[13:38:18] <Woet> adept-phil: XSS? no
[13:38:40] <adept-phil> so why would he not be able to make an ajax call x-domain?
[13:40:01] <Woet> adept-phil: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[13:40:25] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: So what are you trying to achieve and what's not working as expected?
[13:40:51] <GoGoGarrett> again, when reordering it should store the new order in the database
[13:40:58] <GoGoGarrett> which is what that action it does it's posting to
[13:41:13] <GoGoGarrett> but the error is "SyntaxError: Unexpected token <"  so i'm assuming the json isnt properly formated
[13:41:37] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: how are you re-ordering?
[13:41:49] <adept-phil> I can't see any method to re-order in your examples
[13:41:52] <erebel55> are jquery svg's well supported?
[13:41:55] <GoGoGarrett> with rails controller code, but that isn't relevant to the javascript
[13:42:25] <GoGoGarrett> it's not even submitting the data.
[13:42:32] <nickcooley> @GoGoGarrett -- there are 4 missing js files in your jsfiddle -- are any of them related to the interactivity for sorting or reordering?
[13:42:42] <adept-phil> Woet: So that policy is always in place? I have never needed to make any calls external from port 80 on the current domain and if I have I've always used a call to the backend and achieved it using curl
[13:43:14] <GoGoGarrett> nope, only thing that has to do with sorting is NestedSortable (which is the resouce) and the jquery UI sortable
[13:43:17] <adept-phil> nickcooley: I did ask GoGoGarrett to sort his resources out earlier
[13:43:59] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: how do I sort a column?
[13:44:12] <GoGoGarrett> to the left of the greybox's title
[13:44:19] <GoGoGarrett> there is normaly an image handle, but you can drag and drop just holding taht area
[13:44:29] <GoGoGarrett> [here] Dapibus Elit
[13:45:38] <adept-phil> GoGoGarrett: Ah ok... You might have wanted to say that :D
[13:46:10] <adept-phil> jsfiddle is being slow... 2 secs
[13:46:23] <adept-phil> what language is dapibus elit?
[13:47:26] <foo> http://pastebin.com/Xr734UBy - anyone see anything wrong with that last line? I was hoping context.setScale(280,320); would solve my problem, thanks
[13:47:28] <GoGoGarrett> That isn't what is causing the errors :P it's just Ipsum text.
[13:48:05] <adept-phil> No I was just wondering if that translated to "sort by" or something that may have given me a clue :D
[13:50:23] <Gonad> ok my head is about to explode
[13:50:52] <Gonad> this works: $(this).css({"backgroundPosition":"0 -30px"}).addClass("return");
[13:50:52] <Gonad> but this doesn't: $(this).animate({"backgroundPosition":"(0 -30px)"}).addClass("return");
[13:50:58] <Gonad> what am I doing wrong?
[13:51:03] <Gonad> im trying to animate the background position changing
[13:51:58] <frewsxcv> i'm using a third party API that doesn't support JSONP, and so i'm using a cross domain proxy. the api outputs xml. is it more effecient to convert to json on the server side or just have jquery absorb the xml?
[13:52:54] <gloomer> i would guess having jquery absorb the xml
[13:57:06] <foo> I am using this to draw an image: context.drawImage('image/img.png', 0, 0, 560, 640); - if I want to resize this image (so I create image at 560/640 and then shrink it), how can I do that? Can't seem to figure this out
[13:59:09] <gloomer> can you post an example
[13:59:18] <foo> gloomer: who's that for?
[13:59:59] <gloomer> for you
[14:00:10] <gloomer> post an example of what your trying to do
[14:03:06] <lastManStanding> Was looking at css rule animation as opposed to using inline styles, does anyone have any performance stats on this approach vs inline style animation?
[14:04:20] <ngharo> css transforms will probably always be faster
[14:04:25] <adept-phil> lastManStanding: Not too sure I know what you mean? Can you explain?
[14:04:35] <lastManStanding> sure.
[14:04:54] <lastManStanding> I have an example, i'll did it out
[14:05:08] <adept-phil> ngharo: CSS3 transitions would of course. However as the questions within a jqeury channel I don't think CSS3 is the chosen method
[14:05:32] <adept-phil> ngharo: or the required animation isn't supported within css3 yet?
[14:06:29] <ngharo> i'm aware
[14:07:51] <lastManStanding> I'm using css3 where supported, i need a consistant fall back and like jquery animate, but modifys inline styles
[14:08:16] <Gonad> doh realized i was missing a plugin
[14:08:30] <adept-phil> lastManStanding: I'm curious, do you believe inline styles vs style sheets would affect animate() performance?
[14:08:48] <adept-phil> lastManStanding: Is that your question?

[14:21:32] <lastManStanding> $('img',"#scope").each(function(){ //do something with each image })
[14:22:41] <ngharo> tiger1000: you've forgot to close out the first fadeIn
[14:22:52] <tiger1000> where ngharo?
[14:23:09] <ngharo> click TidyUp on jsfiddle
[14:23:13] <tiger1000> lastmanstanding can u ellaborate
[14:23:32] <tiger1000> still doesn't run
[14:24:11] <tiger1000> now it does
[14:24:49] <Woet> tiger1000: you replaced scope and put code in the {, right?
[14:25:18] <tiger1000> ngharo how could I loop this ?

[14:33:47] <Woet> ngharo / tiger1000: missed it, sorry
[14:34:20] <tiger1000> thanks both of you....didn't think about enclosing it in a var
[14:34:28] <tiger1000> and using call back that way
[14:36:10] <dgs> have an odd issue with jquery (which I'm very new to, so it may not be that oddâ€¦). I'm trying to grab the contentWindow on an iframe. This works fine using vanilla javascript (getElementById), but when I use the jquery selector it returns undefined. (See https://gist.github.com/05790dcbbbb7f6992d78 )
[14:36:47] <dgs> not a huge issue as I can just use getElementById, but curious as why it wouldn't work with the jquery selector....
[14:40:36] <tiger1000> can u call a variable from inside a variable?
[14:40:57] <gloomer> example needed
[14:41:09] <gloomer> but sure
[14:42:53] <tiger1000> gloomer http://jsfiddle.net/Cuzvf/8/
[14:43:55] <tiger1000> the code works fine until I enclose it in a var http://jsfiddle.net/Cuzvf/4/
[14:44:14] <ngharo> tiger1000: http://jsfiddle.net/Cuzvf/10/
[14:44:52] <gloomer> nice ngharo
[14:45:48] <gloomer> you can't assign doa with a definition that conatins doa
[14:46:20] <tiger1000> can you point me to documentation for cycle
[14:46:52] <tiger1000> the last line is selecting all div elements inside container starting with the "first" correct?
[14:47:17] <tiger1000> and then implmeneted the code enclosed in the cycle function
[14:47:52] <ngharo> it selects just the first child div of container
[14:48:49] <tiger1000> just? but it scrolles through? so doesn't that mean it "starts" with the first child div?
[14:49:09] <tiger1000> (not being sarcastic, just seeking clarification)
[14:49:46] <ngharo> it starts with whatever you pass to cycle, in this case the first child div
[14:50:23] <ngharo> you'll see it look for which to animate next by calling next() on $this (which is '#container > div:first' the first run)
[14:51:04] <ngharo> if $this.next() is empty (we hit the last div, #c) then grab the first sibling (div #a)
[14:51:17] * gloomer learns something new
[14:52:03] <tiger1000> what does th e? mean ngharo?
[14:52:16] <ngharo> eh?
[14:52:36] <tiger1000> the ? between ($this.next().length !== 0) ? $this.next()
[14:53:00] <ngharo> ?g unary operator @ tiger1000
[14:53:01] <bot-t> tiger1000, Unary operation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation
[14:53:17] <pajo> i have a scoping problem, why doesnt each form's function get it's own data (it's always the last's data) line 55-70 -> http://pastebin.com/0k8WgGGd
[14:53:45] <ngharo> err
[14:53:47] <tiger1000> thanks
[14:54:10] <tiger1000> was their an alternative to console.log for displaying $this?
[14:54:52] <ngharo> tiger1000: sorry thats a ternary condition... not unary

[14:55:35] <tiger1000> thanks
[14:55:58] <ngharo> tiger1000: why would you want to alternate to console.log?
[14:56:10] <ngharo> tiger1000: are you familiar with console.log?  if not i recommend you open your console ;)
[14:56:31] <tiger1000> my familiarity with console.log is with straight javascript
[14:56:40] <tiger1000> the scope extends only as far as the codeacademy.com course
[14:57:08] <tiger1000> I was just inquiring about alternatives in an effort to increase my understanding of jquery and javascript
[14:57:34] <ngharo> ahh, nah that's pretty much the best way to look at data inline
[14:57:34] <tiger1000> I'm very green at this point
[14:57:39] <tiger1000> I appreciate everyoens help and patience
[14:58:40] <pajo> http://pastebin.com/ucsBipWC <- what do i need to do with the scope so each keypress(function()) will alert me it's own content and not the last one i init?
[14:58:51] <ngharo> i wasnt sure what $this.next() would return when it hit #c, but with the console.log there I could see it was empty (aka .length eq 0) when it happened
[15:01:29] <tiger1000> how do I open my console?
[15:01:44] <ngharo> what browser?
[15:01:49] <tiger1000> chrome
[15:02:01] <ngharo> ctrl+shift+I
[15:02:18] <ngharo> or gear menu > developer tools
[15:02:59] <tiger1000> coooooool
[15:04:46] <tiger1000> so without console.log I won't see anything in the console
[15:05:04] <yamahaaaout> hey, do you think its feasible to on load to find strings with http://, and append <a href=" ... to make them a link?
[15:05:09] <ngharo> tiger1000: you'll see errors if you have any
[15:05:24] <adept-phil> tiger1000: this will help :D
[15:05:25] <adept-phil> www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/javascript-debugging-beginners
[15:05:44] <ngharo> tiger1000: you wouldve seen your syntax error thrown if you had you console open on your first fiddle
[15:06:19] <adept-phil> f12 is the key to press to open your developer tools btw
[15:06:39] <adept-phil> in chrome that is. And when you have Firebug installed on FF
[15:07:21] <tiger1000> or right click inspect element
[15:07:23] <yamahaaaout> i need to grab everything after http:// , but before the next space , and convert that to the a href="value
[15:08:07] <tiger1000> @ngharo any advice on how I can accelarate my jquery education
[15:08:08] <tiger1000> ?
[15:10:56] <adept-phil> yamahaaaout: you can either explode the string based on '/' to an array and refference each element or use reg exp's to extract what you need
[15:11:19] <yamahaaaout> why would I need to explode anything?
[15:11:21] <tiger1000> how likely is it, a website visitor will have javascript disabled?
[15:11:24] <yamahaaaout> each character in array?
[15:11:52] <ngharo> tiger1000: read lots of code
[15:12:10] <ngharo> ?ftj @ tiger1000
[15:12:11] <bot-t> tiger1000, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:12:18] <tiger1000> and disect it line b line?
[15:12:57] <erebel55> does jquery have anything for zooming svg?
[15:13:23] <adept-phil> yamahaaaout: sorry, explode() is for php. split() is what you may need. It splits a string into an array based on a seperator
[15:13:47] <adept-phil> yamahaaaout: or use a plugin like this
[15:13:48] <adept-phil> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/parsing-urls-with-the-dom/
[15:14:38] <adept-phil> that last example uses a combination of reg exp's and split() and str replacements to achieve a usefull amount of results
[15:14:50] <yamahaaaout> thanks for that plugin
[15:15:12] <adept-phil> erebel55: Can't you do that programaticaaly? If you want to zoom x2 increase each co-ordinate of the svg x2
[15:15:42] <adept-phil> erebel55: or something similar
[15:27:13] <miket3> using jseditable  does anyone know how to pass the original value....   I want to trap for an error and replace the edit area with the original value.
[15:27:57] <miket3> i meant jeditable
[15:28:03] <erebel55> adept-phil: yeah i guess i could do that. i just didn't know if there was a more best practice way of doing it
[15:28:06] <donal> hi all
[15:28:16] <donal> I have 3 radio buttons and by default the first one is checked
[15:28:43] <donal> <input id="priority" type="radio" value="LOWLINE" checked="checked" name="priority">
[15:28:52] <donal> <input id="priority" type="radio" value="MIDLINE" name="priority">
[15:29:06] <donal> <input id="priority" type="radio" value="HEADLINE" name="priority">
[15:29:15] <donal> so the initial markup looks like the above
[15:29:25] <donal> but the user can change which button is selected
[15:29:47] <donal> but when I run the code $('input:radio[name=priority]:checked').val();
[15:30:20] <donal> it always returns the button that is initially selected, i.e. the button with checked='checked' in the markup
[15:30:23] <donal> rather than the one that is currently selected
[15:30:39] <donal> how can I get the value of the button that is currently selected instead?
[15:31:02] <ngharo> IDs must be unique
[15:31:06] <ngharo> i'd fix that then try again
[15:31:16] <donal> thanks, I'll try that
[15:39:40] <dispyfree113> Hi
[15:40:05] <dispyfree113> I want to show the images only if they have already loaded. My current approach: http://pastebin.com/ve3ynHNW Does that seem correct? I don't get any errors but it doesn't work either :)
[15:54:55] <kenthree> can a jquery plugin be an object? i'm having a bit of trouble
[15:55:17] <erebel55> does jquery support canvas elements?
[15:55:28] <erebel55> i'm trying to do a work around with canvas so that zooming is easier
[16:07:15] <erebel55> hm i guess it doesn't support canvas
[16:09:33] <Es0teric> when i hover over an element that contains multiple classes on the same page, how do i stop all of them from triggering at the same time once a hover occurs?
[16:17:19] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: they can't trigger at the same time, they have to be sequential
[16:18:44] <Es0teric> johnkpaul they all trigger at the same time when i hover
[16:21:56] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: so what is the reprocussion of that, are there animations happenning, seemingly at the same time?
[16:26:08] <Es0teric> johnkpaul yeah
[16:26:17] <MarkoHeijnen> Hey guys, anone knows a good example for editing an h2 element by clicking on it? So it change to an input
[16:26:26] <Es0teric> johnkpaul i want the animations to trigger one at a time
[16:33:53] <raj> is using $(this) faster internally than using $('.myclass') repeatedly?
[16:34:53] <tw2113> raj i would assume so, or assign your selector to a variable and use the variable repeatedly
[16:35:30] <raj> k, so that's faster, i just wanted to make sure
[16:35:32] <raj> thanks
[16:35:39] <tw2113> i can't confirm, just assume
[16:35:50] <raj> oh, wait, why would assigning a variable be faster?
[16:36:15] <tw2113> well, it could just reference the selector in memory instead of traversing the dom on every iteration
[16:36:37] <Es0teric> raj, i am not using the same selector constantlyâ€¦ the same selector appears in the page multiple times
[16:36:59] <Es0teric> so it is in face $('#mydiv').hover(); triggers all divs with the id div
[16:37:00] <tw2113> Es0teric i think he was asking for his own stuff, not yours
[16:37:06] <Es0teric> oh
[16:37:09] <Es0teric> nvm
[16:37:10] <Es0teric> >.>
[16:37:11] <raj> :)
[16:40:10] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: you might want to look into jquery's .stop()
[16:40:18] <johnkpaul> ?stop @Es0teric
[16:40:19] <bot-t> Es0teric, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[16:42:46] <Phiphel> Can I make an object contain a span and a text node as siblings - so I can append() and I'll get <element><span>text1</span>text2</element>, I'm trying to save a span tag, so to speak.
[16:44:14] <johnkpaul> Phiphel: you can using document.createTextNode
[16:44:43] <Phiphel> Is there an jquery version of that? Like $("<span>")?
[16:44:55] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know
[16:47:21] <Phiphel> Just gonna use two spans then, no biggie. :)
[16:48:29] <johnkpaul> Phiphel: this might be of intertst
[16:48:29] <johnkpaul> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/proposal-text-for-document-createtextnode-text
[16:49:53] <johnkpaul> Phiphel: append does it
[16:49:53] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/AMxTE/
[16:54:06] <cbobo> n #linux
[16:58:43] <Es0teric> johnkpaul wait.. stop() with what?
[16:59:10] <johnkpaul> so in your hover handlers, stop() the animations before you start them
[16:59:57] <johnkpaul> there could be many different causes for your issues, but ideally the elements that are being hovered on, wouldn't be contained in other elements that also have hover handlers
[17:00:12] <johnkpaul> if you .stop() them before you start a new one, it will be more fluid
[17:13:12] <erebel55> does anyone know how to get the viewBox of an svg?
[17:13:13] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/p3vq5/20/

[17:44:54] <Es0teric> yo johnkpaul
[17:44:57] <Es0teric> are you there
[17:47:40] <johnkpaul> yeah
[17:47:48] <johnkpaul> have to head out in a few minutes though
[17:47:54] <johnkpaul> have a question?
[17:49:15] <Es0teric> johnkpaul yeah, what did you mean by do a stop() animation on the div?
[17:49:20] <Es0teric> *stop on the animation

[17:50:27] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/FxL6F/ for an example
[17:51:02] <Es0teric> johnkpaul i don't understand thatâ€¦
[17:51:12] <Es0teric> you only have one div.. you don't have 7 divs with the same class or id
[17:51:12] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: can you show us your code
[17:51:25] <johnkpaul> you have multiple divs with the same id?
[17:51:44] <tw2113> i hope they don't share the same ID
[17:51:57] <Es0teric> tw2113 i am talking about classes
[17:51:59] <Es0teric> but said ID
[17:52:03] <css> y u do that
[17:52:05] <css> y u no say class
[17:52:08] <tw2113> and i was commenting on that last part
[17:52:13] <tw2113> ;)
[17:52:41] <Es0teric> johnkpaul -> http://notey.it/n/NTE

[17:54:16] <johnkpaul> Es0teric: I gues I should have asked for a live example
[17:54:32] <johnkpaul> so you have multiple assignment_types
[17:54:45] <johnkpaul> and each of them are fadeToggling every single edit_evt_container?
[17:56:51] <Es0teric> johnkpaul correct
[17:57:04] <johnkpaul> so what would you like to happen?
[17:57:12] <johnkpaul> if you hover over assignment type, and then another assignment type
[17:57:22] <johnkpaul> you want edit_evt to first fade open
[17:57:27] <johnkpaul> and then immediately fade close?
[17:57:48] <Es0teric> johnkpaul right now all of them toggle when i hover over one
[17:57:56] <Es0teric> i want to toggle one by one
[17:58:01] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[17:58:04] <johnkpaul> but that's what your code is syaing
[17:58:13] <Es0teric> so then how do i tell it to toggle one by one?
[17:58:18] <Es0teric> do a .each() on .assignment_type?
[17:58:33] <johnkpaul> I am confused, how are assignement_type and edit_evt_container related
[17:58:45] <johnkpaul> line 2 of your code, says "fadeToggle every single edit_evt_container" on the page
[17:58:47] <Es0teric> johnkpaul assignment_type is the parent
[17:58:51] <johnkpaul> ah
[17:58:54] <johnkpaul> then you want
[17:59:06] <johnkpaul> $(this).find(".edit_evt_container").fadetoggle
[18:06:38] <Es0teric> awesome, johnkpaul
[18:06:39] <Es0teric> thanks man
[18:06:51] <johnkpaul> no problem
[18:06:56] <johnkpaul> have fun
[18:07:21] <johnkpaul> ?find @Es0teric for more information
[18:07:23] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "find @Es0teric for more information" in jQuery Docs.
[18:07:32] <johnkpaul> haha
[18:07:37] <johnkpaul> ?find
[18:07:38] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[18:07:49] <Es0teric> johnkpaul so when i want to trigger an element one by one
[18:07:54] <Es0teric> then i just do .find()?
[18:08:07] <johnkpaul> I dont' really know what you mean by one by one
[18:08:23] <johnkpaul> "this" inside of an event handler is bound to the dom element that you've attached the event handler to
[18:08:30] <johnkpaul> the _particular_ dom element
[18:08:36] <tw2113> Es0teric needs to figure out how to animate just the dom element he's hovered on
[18:08:47] <johnkpaul> I think he's achieved that, no Es0teric?
[18:08:51] <tw2113> that happens to have a shared class
[18:11:44] <Es0teric> yeah, johnkpaul
[18:50:59] <mod_> Because of the way my webapp generates some image markup, I have to rewrite the markup using javascript. I take the <img> take out of the markup it comes in, massage it a bit, and then append() it to another div container.  When I try to get the width of the images as written into the DOM in the new container, the width is always 0
[18:51:38] <mod_> Is there somethign I need to do to the rewritten div's to get them to render?
[18:51:44] <mod_> have the correct width?
[18:58:38] <kenthree> :checked is not selecting checked radios and I can't reproduce it in a clean environment
[18:58:45] <kenthree> any suggestions on how to debug this?

[19:37:46] <oojacoboo> hey guys, how would I go about using $.each with this json_encoded set?  http://pastebin.com/tss0Ryer
[19:38:28] <oojacoboo> I guess what's stumping me up is the 0, 1, 2â€¦ keys which is the primary object, no?
[19:59:15] <oojacoboo> stop drinking green beer and help me with my question :)
[20:03:46] <dwarder_> is that ok that i'll add an artificial param to my tag and then use it to fetch this data i.e. <a myparam="something" id="t1"> and then in script $(
[20:04:07] <oojacoboo> ?data
[20:04:08] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[20:05:27] <dwarder_> is that ok that i'll add an artificial param to my tag and then use it to fetch this data i.e. <a myparam="something" id="t1"> and then in script $('#t1').val , well i don't know
[20:05:40] <dwarder_> how to fetch it
[20:05:42] <dwarder_> ?
[20:05:53] <oojacoboo> dwarder_: read that link
[20:06:03] <oojacoboo> ?data @ dwarder_
[20:06:04] <bot-t> dwarder_, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[20:07:15] <dwarder_> ok, thanks
[20:07:58] <premapix> Hi JQs -- Just wondering if anyone has some tips for adding variables to a callback (other than the variables normally passed by the callback)
[20:09:04] <oojacoboo> premapix: you could pass an array in the return
[20:09:22] <oojacoboo> just depends on what you're trying to do really
[20:11:01] <premapix> HI oojacaboo -- I'm looking up a gmap geocode and would ideally likely pass some variables on the way out to collect on the way back
[20:11:23] <premapix> oojacoboo - sory
[20:12:24] <oojacoboo> premapix: not really sure I follow the situation
[20:12:28] <oojacoboo> do you have a testcase, or some code?
[20:12:49] <premapix> Yes shall I pastebin it?
[20:12:53] <oojacoboo> sure
[20:13:00] <premapix> Cool thanks for your help
[20:16:37] <premapix> oojacob0oo: Here is pastebin http://pastebin.com/mhpTkMgc
[20:17:20] <oojacoboo> premapix: so what's the situation?
[20:17:37] <johnkpaul-afk> premapix: are you doing something like $().each(geoCode)?
[20:18:15] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: he probably will be
[20:18:20] <oojacoboo> but that wasn't his question
[20:18:22] <premapix> Yes
[20:19:15] <premapix> Inside the each I'm retrieving data from the page
[20:19:32] <johnkpaul> so if you want to pass more variables, you can change it to $().each(function(){geoCode(this,extravariable1,eextravariable2)})
[20:20:58] <premapix> thinks .....
[20:23:40] <premapix> OK thanks -- think I've got it -- somehow had the idea that if I did that then the vars wouldn't be available when the callback fires
[20:23:52] <premapix> Thanks very much both -- appreciated
[20:40:00] <rburton-> Is there a way to unit test an ajax query without hitting the server?
[20:40:46] <oojacoboo> rburton-: without hitting the server?
[20:40:56] <rburton-> yes without doing an actual ajax request
[20:40:57] <oojacoboo> you mean without using your webserver?
[20:41:09] <rburton-> could I have it hit a local file on disk
[20:41:18] <oojacoboo> how are you going to process the backend code?
[20:41:23] <rburton-> it's ruby
[20:41:35] <rburton-> I want to simulate the request and the payload coming back
[20:41:41] <oojacoboo> so setup ruby to not use your webserver then
[20:42:03] <rburton-> I really wanted to avoid all that overhead
[20:42:15] <oojacoboo> how else are you going to do it?
[20:42:29] <rburton-> wanted to see if there were options
[20:42:48] <oojacoboo> well logic says the backend code has to be processed
[20:42:56] <oojacoboo> so, it's either through the webserver or not
[20:43:01] <oojacoboo> eitherway, ruby has to run it
[20:43:05] <rburton-> In java I would just have a impl of the interface and have it spit results I expected
[20:43:17] <oojacoboo> well, java compiles
[20:43:40] <oojacoboo> I don't know a ton about ruby, but it doesn't compile, right?
[20:43:50] <oojacoboo> it's a script lang, correct?
[20:43:55] <rburton-> There's no way to intercept the request and say "don't hit the server here's a object to use for the response"
[20:44:15] <rburton-> k I'll figure something out
[20:44:16] <oojacoboo> what do you mean, don't hit the server?
[20:44:30] <oojacoboo> if you call the url, your webserver is the first thing that listens
[20:44:34] <ngharo> just run the callback with your expected results
[20:45:00] <oojacoboo> rbrooks: why not setup a secondary webserver?
[20:45:07] <oojacoboo> are you worried about statistics?
[20:45:34] <rburton-> na just want it to be self contanted
[20:45:49] <oojacoboo> well, another webserver could do that
[20:46:02] <oojacoboo> I'm not sure what you mean by contained though, that's kind of vague
[20:46:17] <rburton-> contained meaning not depending on an external system?
[20:46:25] <rburton-> K I think I got my answer thanks
[20:46:26] <oojacoboo> ah
[20:46:57] <rburton-> working on a JavaScript library for EasyShout.com so others can interface with the system without having to write much code.
[20:47:11] <rburton-> Releasing a client that uses PhoneGap
[20:47:44] <oojacoboo> cool
[20:55:01] <raj> what is data.context?
[21:30:51] <premapix> Hi All! Could someone help with this ... I'm trying to construct this array using JS objects -- Is this an array of JSON objects and do I have to do anything special to convert a JSON object to a JS object ?
[21:30:52] <premapix> http://pastebin.com/3TuG72r1
[21:31:18] <premapix> JSON array that I have to recreate above
[21:37:01] <ngharo> myMarkers.markers[0].latitude
[21:38:04] <premapix> ngharo. OK get it thanks very much
[21:38:07] <tw2113> mmm json
[21:42:00] <raj> i'm trying to figure out the meaning of data.context
[21:42:05] <raj> can someone enlighten me please?
[21:42:16] <ngharo> raj: that means nothing
[21:42:22] <ngharo> in what context
[21:42:32] <raj> context: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1]
[21:42:44] <raj> when I console.log(data)
[21:42:55] <raj> context is the first thing under Object
[21:43:12] <raj> it has a length of 1
[21:43:19] <raj> 0: HTMLDivElement
[21:43:33] <tw2113> sounds like it may hold a div
[21:44:18] <raj> clasName: "progress_context"
[21:44:19] <ngharo> raj: are you talking about $('selector', context)
[21:44:46] <raj> no
[21:44:51] <raj> it's for jquery file-upload
[21:45:07] <raj> the add: callback
[21:46:05] <ngharo> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ this?
[21:46:21] <raj> yes sir
[21:49:38] <raj> ngharo, any idea?
[21:50:45] <ngharo> not familiar with the plugin
[21:51:33] <raj> ngharo, isn't that something that should be documented?
[21:51:38] <raj> cuz I don't see it anywhere
[21:52:28] <ngharo> oh i see, data must be a jquery object
[21:53:08] <raj> yeah
[21:53:48] <tw2113> documentation isn't required for anything, but always a great idea
[21:55:15] <ngharo> raj: read jquery source if you're really concerned what that value is
[21:55:37] <raj> so all jquery objects have a context property?
[21:55:56] <ngharo> yes
[21:56:09] <raj> what info is contained within that property?
[21:56:22] <tw2113> i wonder if that's a jquery thing or a js thing
[21:57:12] <ngharo> raj: usually it'll be second parameter -> $('foo', context)
[21:57:37] <raj> what's that mean?
[21:57:49] <ngharo> foo inside context
[21:58:02] <raj> i still don't know what you mean
[21:58:38] <tw2113> http://www.xwt.org/javadoc/org/xwt/js/JS.Context.html ?
[21:59:50] <raj> tw2113, not really sure what that means either
[22:00:03] <raj> encapsulates the state of a js "thread" ?
[22:00:26] <tw2113> that's why you google around to see if you can learn
[22:00:33] <raj> yeah
[22:01:07] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5304039/in-javascripts-underscore-js-library-what-does-context-mean-and-how-do-i-use
[22:01:18] <tw2113> says it's for underscores.js, but i imagine it's info for most things
[22:08:30] <raj> tw2113, so it's useless unless i'm using "this" ?
[22:09:46] <tw2113> dunno
[22:09:52] <tw2113> i'm not too familiar with it myself, but i googled
[22:10:02] <raj> yeah, my google results suck
[22:10:06] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/context/
[22:10:15] <raj> not explained here either
[22:14:24] <Qalqi> come on people , u must growup and start using serverside js too
[22:14:32] <Qalqi> have a look at node.js
[22:17:25] <raj> that's random
[23:17:36] <jehoshua02> I have a table row with several input fields in it. What event is fired when all focus leaves the row?
[23:21:25] <jehoshua02> I'm sorry, did anybody see my question?
[23:24:09] <jehoshua02> I want to program to the event where all focus leaves the row. I was thinking focusout, but the problem is that it fires even when focus moves within the row.
[23:26:00] <someprimetime> how can i add a div and then position it at the same time?
[23:26:38] <someprimetime> var $div = $('<span class="foobar"></span'); $div.css('top', '20'); or whatever
[23:32:59] <scr3am1> someprimetime: yeah simply chain it...
[23:33:34] <tw2113> var $div = $('<span class="foobar"></span').css('top', '20');
[23:33:47] <tw2113> maybe
[23:33:56] <tw2113> $('<span class="foobar"></span').css('top', '20'); ?
[23:34:48] <scr3am1> sure
