[00:09:12] <sili> Hi. For a given element, say a <td> in a <tr>, is there a way to know that it's the Nth child of the <tr>?
[00:09:34] <sili> basically I have an event in a cell and I need to know the column number
[00:10:56] <sili> knowing the row number would be handy, too
[00:16:16] <sili> Ah. .index() is what I want. Thanks anyway
[00:16:38] <anli_> I have serious problems popping up a datepicker in a dialog
[00:16:47] <anli_> Maybe I should create a minimal example from it
[00:17:24] <coldhead> bot-t: tell SIDU you can roll your own custom smaller jQuery UI at the jquery UI download page
[00:17:25] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[00:17:37] <coldhead> thanks bot0t
[00:17:47] <coldhead> thanks bot-t  even
[00:18:09] <coldhead> bot-t: tell bot-t1 thanks
[00:18:10] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[00:18:59] <Trisox> hey coldhead
[00:19:06] <Trisox> ?botsnack
[00:19:07] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[00:22:52] <coldhead> bot-t: thanks
[00:22:52] * bot-t sighs
[00:23:02] <coldhead> hi Trisox
[00:23:08] <Trisox> yo
[00:23:10] <coldhead> please kill me?
[00:29:48] <anli_> When I clone a form containing datepickers and put the clone in a dialog, should the datepickers still work?
[00:29:56] <anli_> (i.e. popup a datepicker when I click on them)
[00:30:57] <Trisox> no!
[00:31:25] <anli_> hm, with clone(true, true), I had still working datepickers
[00:31:28] <anli_> Thats nice
[00:31:34] <anli_> although I hate flag arguments

[01:15:39] <ottorinde> can anyone recommend a good debugging tool for jquery? I'm used to visual studio. I'm using firebug, but I don't think it's very efficient when it comes to reading what the contents of my variables are. You have to click your way through the DOM tree right, or am I using it wrong?
[01:17:03] <aavikkojootti> firebug also supports breakspoints
[01:17:15] <aavikkojootti> and variable watch
[01:17:26] <aavikkojootti> you should try the script tab
[01:17:40] <ottorinde> ah
[01:18:11] <ottorinde> yes, I see now that there are some additional options
[01:18:14] <ottorinde> thanks
[01:18:19] <aaronmcadam> ottorinde: read this site fixingthesejquery.com
[01:18:54] <aaronmcadam> ottorinde: there's a lot more to firebug than clicking thru the dom
[01:18:55] <ottorinde> thank you!
[01:19:17] <aaronmcadam> but it does take some time to realise all its features so don't blame yourself hehe
[01:19:23] <ottorinde> :)
[01:19:35] <aaronmcadam> i was the same as you for a while :)
[01:19:56] <aaronmcadam> take 10 mins and read thru that site I told u bout, lots of tips and stuff
[01:20:06] <ottorinde> I will, thanks for the input
[01:20:11] <aaronmcadam> no probs!
[01:22:38] <Naktibalda> Hi. I have a site with ui.checkBox widget, how to mark it as checked programatically?
[01:23:47] <aaronmcadam> attr( 'checked', true) Naktibalda
[01:24:18] <aaronmcadam> though you might need to use jq ui's api
[01:24:35] <aaronmcadam> dunno, that's how you'd do it with a simple checkbox
[01:25:58] <Naktibalda> yep, doesn't work with jq ui
[01:27:00] <aaronmcadam> read the docs then
[01:28:42] <Naktibalda> it's a missing part in docs :)
[01:28:52] <Naktibalda> nobody needs it probably
[01:29:07] <aaronmcadam> can't be right
[01:29:34] <aaronmcadam> you sure you don't need to call a refresh method on it to update it's ui state too
[01:44:03] <jac0bz1> hi!
[01:45:08] <jac0bz1> I have a plugin that creates a "lightbox" with an iframe.. is there a way to close this lightbox from the iframe? When using ajax, i just use $.fn.dialog.close();  (this is a public method)
[01:45:32] <jac0bz1> I've tried parent.$.fn.dialog.close();
[01:50:26] <aaronmcadam> $.fn won't work don't think
[01:50:40] <aaronmcadam> $.fn means $( selector/element )
[01:51:34] <aaronmcadam> how would it know which dialog instance you're referring to without a selector?
[01:52:40] <jac0bz1> its a global method.. besides, i only run one dialog at the time
[02:00:00] <_bart> Hi
[02:00:12] <knubbze-> hi _bart
[02:00:31] <_bart> How do I figure out what kind of html tag $(this) is? (for example a <p> or a <img>)
[02:02:08] <_bart> Ah found it, .get(0).tagName.
[02:02:21] <_bart> Still I find the [0] or .get(0) a bit odd.
[02:02:53] <aaronmcadam> [0] unwraps the object
[02:03:02] <aaronmcadam> so you can get DOM props from it _bart
[02:10:22] <theTree> hi guys, I have a quick question if someone could take a look? http://pastie.org/2426890
[02:10:30] <noaXess> hey all
[02:10:46] <noaXess> is there any other way to refresh the content of a dialog instead of close and reopen the dialog?
[02:15:51] <aaronmcadam> noaXess: you can manipulate the content like any other div
[02:15:54] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue?
[02:16:45] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: aha.. ok.. so with .html...
[02:18:10] <James-_> hello http://pastie.org/2426911
[02:18:21] <James-_> i don t undestand why id never change
[02:18:33] <_bart> how do I force myself out of a each loop?
[02:18:38] <_bart> using simply break;?
[02:18:47] <formers> break;
[02:18:48] <bot-t> (15 hours 30 mins ago) <sadmicrowave> tell formers I made the drag/scroll functionality into a plugin and made some changes so it would work with Y axis scrolling also: http://pastebin.com/NNvhyVbC
[02:19:49] <aaronmcadam> noaXess: yeah basically
[02:20:04] <boxbeatsy> hi, i've setup a jQuery.ajax call that posts to a webpage, and executes some js upon success.  however, when using chrome (ff works), the success function is never called.  (eg code block: https://gist.github.com/72a42d517204b1b4681d)  does anyone know what my problem might be?
[02:20:27] <boxbeatsy> as long as the response is 200, shouldnt it execute the success function?
[02:20:33] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: so.. the .dialog command just generate the dialog around the specified div container, right?
[02:20:48] <aaronmcadam> aye
[02:21:48] <Spadeski> yo
[02:21:51] <kingofkolt> Hi all. Is there a jQuery event for reacting to when an element has been added to the DOM? Almost like a .load(), but for regular elements like DIV's.
[02:22:24] <James-_> hello http://pastie.org/2426911 why my #dm_comment_form_comment_id    never change and keep the same value
[02:22:36] <_bart> formers: and if I want to do that in an if block? I get unlabeled break must be inside loop or switch
[02:24:11] <kingofkolt> James-_: I don't see the #dm_commentâ€¦ element anywhere on the page...?
[02:24:25] <formers> _bart: not following you, you want to exit an if statement ?  why would you premeturly exit an if statement ?
[02:24:56] <_bart> formers: that's not what I want to do, I want to exit the parent .each the if statement is in.
[02:26:00] <formers> so something like for(i=0; i<10; i++){if(i=2){break;}}  ?
[02:26:15] <James-_> kingofkolt    http://pastie.org/2426936   here ;)
[02:26:34] <[E]sc> not sure if this is the right channel, but i have a script that uses onlick=load("..."), which loads a submit form to upload photos. i have set the submit button to be disabled until the user chooses a file, however, when the page loads and i try to submit the photo, the submit button is still disabled, is there something i'm doing wrong with the script? i'm not experienced at all with this jquery...
[02:27:22] <formers> _bart: $(".allDiv").each(function(){ if(something=something){ return false}});
[02:27:26] <jimXL> How are you enabling it?
[02:27:52] <_bart> formers: thanks!
[02:28:20] <formers> i meant something == something :p
[02:28:22] <formers> np
[02:28:49] <_bart> formers: another question, I have a set of html tags with a class named "batch". Now how do I put all that html (so not just all the contents of .batch) in one variable?
[02:29:29] <_bart> So something like var container; should contain <div class="batch">blah</div><img class="batch" src="something.png" /><p class="batch">Okay</p>
[02:29:30] <zhrance> hello there, does someone know a jQuery code/plugin to show Google Analytics Stats on your page?
[02:30:38] <formers> _bart: var myVar = ""; $(".batch").each(function(){myVar += $(this).contents();});
[02:31:29] <_bart> formers: then myVar would only contain the contents of for example <p class="batch">Blah</p>
[02:31:47] <_bart> myVar would then be Blah but I want it to be <p class="batch">Blah</p>.
[02:32:46] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ _bart
[02:32:55] <aaronmcadam> goddamn you bot-t
[02:33:04] <formers> what's p?
[02:33:14] <formers> _bart : http://api.jquery.com/html/
[02:33:25] <aaronmcadam> it's not here :(
[02:33:29] <aaronmcadam> where's temp dammit haha
[02:34:26] <_bart> formers: eh.. $(".batch").html(); would give me "Blah" also..
[02:34:44] <aaronmcadam> .filter('img')?
[02:35:12] <formers> this is crap way but: var html = $('<div>').append($('.batch').clone()).remove().html();
[02:36:05] <aaronmcadam> or could use nth selectors
[02:36:11] <_bart> formers: Heh, I see, it would work, isn't there a better way?
[02:36:15] <aaronmcadam> to splice off the first .batch
[02:36:22] <aaronmcadam> or*
[02:36:36] <Merbster> if I call .next() on an input of type text, will it give me the next HTML (any element) or will it give me the next element of the same type as the object where I called .next (in this case input of type text).
[02:36:49] <aaronmcadam> pass it in Merbster
[02:36:53] <aaronmcadam> next('input')
[02:37:05] <aaronmcadam> otherwise yes, you'll get the very next element
[02:37:13] <_bart> I'll test it with batch = $('<div>').append($('.batch').clone()).remove().html();.
[02:37:39] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I tried with .next("input") but it just gives me the object that I called it on (with id ins_161) so in essence .next("input") returns itself.
[02:37:54] <_bart> no way, someone called himself 'test'.
[02:37:55] <formers> _bart: none that I can think  of :/
[02:38:13] <_bart> formers: well thanks anyway :)
[02:38:20] <formers> np
[02:38:43] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, the textboxes I am trying to reference are wrapped in a table structure and some divs. (I don't have power over the html as it is genereted by a CMS).
[02:38:58] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, would this interfere with how .next works?
[02:39:14] <aaronmcadam> yea
[02:39:23] <aaronmcadam> well
[02:39:28] <aaronmcadam> it depends on how ur dom is set
[02:39:36] <aaronmcadam> next works on siblings
[02:39:39] <burzum> can i submit a post via jquery somehow even when i dont have a form?
[02:39:59] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, yes. well if they ahve to be in the same TR element they certainly ain't siblings.
[02:40:00] <aaronmcadam> you you might need to say .next('tr').find('input') if u follow Merbster
[02:40:13] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I think I do. I will try this.
[02:40:22] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, thank you for your time
[02:40:26] <aaronmcadam> no worries!
[02:40:35] <aaronmcadam> you also might need to go back up a level
[02:40:50] <aaronmcadam> ie. .closest('tr').next().find('input')
[02:41:00] <aaronmcadam> if the inputs are all wrapped in trs you see?
[02:41:05] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, If I paste in the HTML structure on pastebin(or the likes) will you take a glance?
[02:41:11] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle
[02:41:15] <aaronmcadam> but please don't post loads
[02:41:23] <aaronmcadam> 2 or 3 rows of the table will suffice
[02:41:45] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I will just take the table structure where it is contained. I will not paste in 200 lines of code generated HTML :P don't worry
[02:41:52] <aaronmcadam> lol
[02:41:58] <aaronmcadam> cool dude, you'd be surpirsed
[02:42:02] <aaronmcadam> surprised*
[02:42:16] <aaronmcadam> had lots of people in here pasting their whole apps nearly lol
[02:42:41] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I am not surprised ;)
[02:45:25] <truecolors> Is it possible to execute an event that's either clicked, or focused instead of doing.. $("form input[type=text]").click(function() { ... }); $("form input[type=text]").focus(function() { ... });
[02:47:15] <truecolors> so something like.. $("form input[type=text]").click OR focus(function() {
[02:47:16] <truecolors> uhm
[02:48:56] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, http://jsfiddle.net/3BgZP/ <-
[02:49:24] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, wait. let me include the JS code I am trying to get working too.
[02:49:29] <murrrley> Hmm, any idea why $.get('etaphp.php', function(data){ $('#etusivu').html(data)
[02:50:19] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, http://jsfiddle.net/3BgZP/1/ <- there
[02:51:13] <murrrley> Argh. Autosend at paste... Anyway! Any idea why that works in local environment, but not when I transfer it over to an external host, it wont?
[02:55:13] <aaronmcadam> make sure the php file is in the same path
[02:55:18] <aaronmcadam> else put a url to it
[02:56:15] <Ankabout> hi, I'm trying to make a layout where elements are floating around a fixed element
[02:56:17] <Ankabout> http://www.webdevout.net/test?0i&raw
[02:56:33] <Ankabout> basically I want the green block to be fixed, and the blue blocks should wrap around it
[02:56:53] <Ankabout> I realise that you can't wrap around fixed elements, but I was hoping a jquery hack could find a creative way around that?
[02:57:42] <ThiefMaster|work> i'm looking for a good example where you'd need different code for different browsers if you didn't use e.g. jquery. any suggestions? something very simple would be perfect.
[02:59:02] <murrrley> aaronmcadam: the path should be correct. They're both in the same folder. Won't work with full url either
[02:59:39] <Merbster> murrrley, if you are developing on windows and uploading to a linux OS, your character casing on filenames DOES matter.
[02:59:42] <Spadeski> the opacity and filter objects are used in two diff browsers in css use them in jquery
[03:01:04] <murrrley> Merbster: Yup. But the name is 100% lowercase in both filename & code :/
[03:01:30] <Merbster> murrrley, It was the only suggestion I had. Sorry :-/
[03:02:11] <Ankabout> is what I want even possible?
[03:02:26] <murrrley> Merbster: Nps, Thanks for taking interest anyway :)
[03:06:25] <Brend> Hi! So I have a bunch of code that does $thing.attr("somens:someattr"). I'm totally certain that it used to work in some version (7?) of IE, but now IE8 is complaining about it. Is this, like, a thing?
[03:08:24] <aaronmcadam> murrrley: an absolute url to ur script won't work?
[03:09:31] <Spadeski> sounds like the file is not permitted or is banned file type which would be wierd for js
[03:12:23] <formers> Brend: You're probably going to want to use .prop() instead of attr() if you are using greater v1.6. But regardless, I haven't seent that you are able to use attr like that before... could be wrong
[03:13:22] <murrrley> aaronmcadam: yeah, absolute path didn't work. But it's good now. It was actually a stupid logic mistake in the syntax leading to the get-method. After looking it through, I've got no idea why it worked in local environment either :D
[03:14:10] <daveyjoe> I'm checking a radio button using jQuery, how do I also fire the onChange event that's associated with the radio button?
[03:15:31] <Brend> formers, usually it won't work as a selector (without a small hack to jQuery's regex for them), but works fine for .attr()
[03:15:50] <gataraid> I'm having a jquery problem I can't get this onclick to set the session variable.
[03:16:53] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/sZkfVFJa
[03:17:00] <gataraid> Someone mind helping me please
[03:17:19] <gataraid> I'm looking at the var_dump of $_SESSION and it doesn't do anything
[03:18:37] <James-_> http://pastie.org/2426911 why my #dm_comment_form_comment_id    never change and keep the same value
[03:18:47] <James-_> http://pastie.org/2426936  view here ;)
[03:19:41] <gataraid> James-_, I just see a form... ntohing more
[03:20:57] <uchuff> gataraid: in the js you have city-selection then in the php you have city
[03:21:08] <uchuff> presumably they should both be the same, one or the other
[03:21:45] <uchuff> there may be other problems with that code, i always have to look at the docs for things like .ajax
[03:21:53] <uchuff> er or .post even
[03:22:09] <gataraid> Still doesn't set the session value :(
[03:22:41] <uchuff> where does it get as far as? i.e. do a console.log(src) before you post
[03:22:54] <uchuff> and do an echo or something in the php before you try setting the session var
[03:23:03] <uchuff> how far does the value get, where's it getting lost
[03:23:16] <gataraid> session var is nul
[03:23:19] <gataraid> null
[03:23:23] <uchuff> right, so work back
[03:23:25] <uchuff> or work up to that
[03:23:31] <uchuff> what is console.log(src)
[03:23:36] <uchuff> put that on line 6
[03:23:44] <uchuff> check your javascript console
[03:23:46] <gataraid> inside <script>?
[03:23:52] <uchuff> yes
[03:23:57] <uchuff> line 6 on your code
[03:24:03] <uchuff> console.log(src);
[03:24:11] <uchuff> see what you can see in the js console
[03:24:49] <gataraid> in the browser?
[03:24:56] <gataraid> I dn't have a JS console, I'm using an IDE
[03:25:00] <gataraid> can I see it in it?
[03:25:54] <formers> gataraid: http://getfirebug.com/
[03:27:45] <uchuff> gataraid: which browser are you using?
[03:27:52] <uchuff> they all have javascript consoles these days
[03:28:00] <uchuff> or are you not using a proper browser?
[03:28:03] <uchuff> you could do
[03:28:05] <uchuff> alert(src);
[03:28:06] <uchuff> instead
[03:28:11] <uchuff> but that's ugly!
[03:29:04] <gataraid> I'm installing firebug now sir, sorry
[03:29:07] <gataraid> I'm using FF
[03:29:47] <uchuff> you don't need firebug to debug javascript but it's a good idea to have it installed, it's console is a lot better than the default one

[03:30:38] <uchuff> ya
[03:30:59] <uchuff> $(".city-select").onclick(function()
[03:31:03] <uchuff> is that in a document ready?
[03:31:20] <uchuff> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[03:31:21] <uchuff>   // Code using $ as usual goes here.
[03:31:21] <uchuff> });
[03:31:25] <gataraid> I removed .onclick and replaced it with .click
[03:31:38] <gataraid> :|
[03:31:46] <uchuff> can you post the full source for the page with the javascript on? can be from a View > Source in the browser
[03:33:11] <gataraid> yes

[03:35:00] <uchuff> console.log(src
[03:35:06] <uchuff> console.log(src);
[03:35:11] <uchuff> needs the semi colon
[03:35:24] <uchuff> should be immediately after
[03:35:25] <uchuff>  var src = $(this).attr("value");
[03:35:52] <gataraid> src is not defined
[03:35:52] <gataraid> [Break On This Error] console.log(src);
[03:35:54] <gataraid> oh
[03:36:30] <gataraid> I see nothing in the console now
[03:37:21] <gataraid> ah
[03:37:23] <gataraid> says file not found
[03:38:38] <uchuff> no point pasting server side code
[03:38:43] <uchuff> just view source in the browser
[03:41:19] <uchuff> you are selecting .city-select however that class doesn't appear to be set on the select box
[03:41:21] <uchuff> <select class="city-select">
[03:41:31] <uchuff> http://jsbin.com/irugov/7/edit
[03:41:34] <uchuff> click "Render"
[03:41:42] <uchuff> watch console
[03:42:27] <uchuff> also rather than .click() you would probably want to use .change()
[03:42:39] <uchuff> as some people might interact with your select using their keyboard rather than their mouse
[03:43:07] <uchuff> http://jsbin.com/irugov/8/edit#preview
[03:43:09] <uchuff> like that
[03:43:41] <uchuff> oh and don't leave the console.logs in there for live as IE will throw errors (unless you add a wrapper that fixes that)
[03:46:51] <uchuff> gataraid: I'm not helping via PM, talk in the main channel if you want
[03:47:07] <uchuff> look at the latest example, try it out, look at the console
[03:47:12] <uchuff> the JavaScript side of things is working
[03:47:20] <uchuff> so you can use that as a reference
[03:47:36] <uchuff> click "Code" and you can look at the code I have put in
[03:47:57] <uchuff> essentially just setting the class on the select, changing to .change() and adding some console.logs
[03:50:33] <uchuff> any queries do ask
[03:50:57] <uchuff> you should also be able to look and see the data getting posted (or not) to your server side code in Firebug
[03:51:06] <uchuff> i think in the network or ajax tabs or something
[03:51:22] <uchuff> not got firebug running at the moment, i use safari
[03:59:14] <Cracker2> i get error in ie 6/7. SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'jQuery16206557129014951646': object is null or undefined  jquery-1.6.2.js, line 1455 character 3
[03:59:44] <uchuff> where do you get this Cracker2 ?
[04:00:14] <Cracker2> running my homepage with ie6/7, other browsers are ok
[04:03:35] <Cracker2> error because of this line
[04:03:36] <Cracker2> $('#toggleTriggers_id_'+triggerIDnumber).html(openedState[triggerIDnumber]+'<div class="clear"></div>');
[04:05:09] <Aamir> Cracker2:  so either triggerIDnumber is not a number/string or there is something wrong with openedState[triggerIDnumber].  .log both values before this line just to make sure
[04:05:45] <aaronmcadam> ?eval isNaN( NaN )
[04:07:00] <Cracker2> LOG: triggerIDnumber is 3;  LOG: openedState(triggerIDnumber) is  <DIV class=.........
[04:07:34] <Cracker2> it's set. it works fine except ie6/7 :/
[04:07:48] <Cracker2> hmm wait
[04:08:12] <Aamir> Cracker2:  check for extra ',' in your code (ie6 don't like it) :P
[04:08:25] <Cracker2> LOG: openedState(triggerIDnumber) is  <DIV class="blahblahblah" ... jQuery16206758403184302246="21">Hide </A></DIV>  SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'jQuery16206758403184302246': object is null or undefined
[04:09:09] <Aamir> Cracker2:  so fix this error and make sure you get proper html here :)
[04:10:34] <Cracker2> where the hell did this come from
[04:10:39] <Cracker2> IE6/7: <A class=show-hide-arrow-up href="javascript: void(0)" jQuery16206180077744852266="21">Hide </A>

[04:11:11] <Aamir> no idea mate :)
[04:12:22] <coldhead> gross, void
[04:13:00] <Cracker2> it sure is! :D

[04:35:59] <vviljanen> manhunter: why not select the tr?
[04:36:44] <manhunter> it has not effect
[04:36:45] <manhunter> $("tr").hover(function(){
[04:37:49] <manhunter> vviljanen: can it be a reason of css overriding ?
[04:38:22] <vviljanen> are your td's position absolute or somethin? resulting that tr's size is zero
[04:39:13] <manhunter> it has not effect , $("tr").hover(function(){
[04:39:14] <manhunter> $(this).toggleClass('classTableRow');
[04:39:40] <manhunter> i need to select all tds from a row
[04:43:36] <Woet> what is a proper way to check whether an object exists in javascript?
[04:43:48] <Woet> i do 'if(typeof gapi !== undefined){', but that doesn't work apparently
[04:44:51] <Woet> but console.log(typeof gapi) returns undefined
[04:45:12] <groenroos_> How can I set a width that is 100% - 20px?
[04:45:23] <ablomen> Woet, typeof returns a string
[04:45:24] <Woet> ah, fixed, undefined is a string
[04:45:25] <manhunter> what's the proper way to select whole row with jquery ?
[04:45:28] <Woet> :)
[04:45:30] * Woet hugs abo
[04:45:32] <Woet> oops
[04:45:34] * Woet hugs ablomen
[04:46:09] <ablomen> thanks i needed that
[04:46:17] <Woet> i knew it
[04:47:05] <jinxdone2> manhunter: just select $('tr td') to get all the td's
[04:47:20] <jinxdone2> or $('tr').find('td');
[04:47:41] <jinxdone2> or whatever suits your use case best.. the traversing functions may be useful.. like .closest() or .children()
[04:51:36] <manhunter> 	$("tr td").hover(function(){
[04:51:36] <manhunter> 		$(this).toggleClass('classTableRow');
[04:51:36] <manhunter> 	})
[04:51:39] <manhunter> that doesn't work
[04:52:47] <vviljanen> I would guess there is something else wrong. it should work with tr also.
[04:53:04] <vviljanen> have you checked with firebug if the class gets toggled?
[04:54:46] <treeTable> Expected declaration but found '*'. Skipped to next declaration.
[04:54:49] <uchuff> are you trying to toggle the class on the cell (td) or the row (tr) manhunter ?
[04:54:55] <treeTable> how can i correct this error?
[04:56:44] <uchuff> treeTable: someone else here might be able to answer you based on that, I however would need to see a link to your page or a post of your code to somewhere like jsbin.com
[05:00:14] <eirikb> Hello. I use jQuery.map and return {name: $(this).attr('name'), value: $(this).val()}  but when I try to run JSON.stringify on the result I get the error circular_structure, how can that be when all objects only contain properties with strings?

[05:01:30] <maZtah> hi guys, i have an element with display: none; on it. i want to copy this element within another div, and show() it, how to do this?
[05:01:43] <eirikb> Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8rszB/
[05:02:36] <uchuff> treeTable: so you are validating your CSS or something?
[05:02:47] <uchuff> or are you having a JQuery problem?
[05:03:25] <treeTable> jquery... i am not able to get a tree working i think its a css problem
[05:03:55] <treeTable> i am trying to get the jquery treeTable
[05:05:38] <eirikb> The thing is that I want to post JSON, and then I use $.ajax and set content-type to application/json. But I also need to stringify (using json2.js or native if exists)
[05:06:42] <eirikb> It seems I can use each instead, and define a varuable over. But map should also work right?
[05:10:41] <formers> can anyone recommend a quality ui library ? (other than JqueryUI and Jquery Tools)
[05:12:03] <NoNoNo> formers: maybe jQuery Mobile?

[05:12:50] <dr0id> Mootools
[05:13:10] <formers> will it work with jquery core ?

[05:32:56] <dabear> Paveloosha: $("".....").find("div.child").get()
[05:34:29] <Paveloosha> <dabear>, thanks, let me try..
[05:34:49] <dabear> Paveloosha: seriously, what did you do to investigate this your self..?
[05:35:05] <dabear> this is so basic
[05:35:10] <dabear> ?docs
[05:35:13] <bot-t> dabear, Main Page - There are a number of alternative resources for browsing the API. http://docs.jquery.com/
[05:35:23] <dabear> ?api
[05:35:24] <bot-t> jQuery API Browser - http://api.jquery.com/ or jQAPI - http://jqapi.com/
[05:35:35] <dabear> those tell you everything you need
[05:36:36] <Paveloosha> <dabear>, it returning "object HTMLDivElement"
[05:36:46] <dabear> Paveloosha: that is correct
[05:36:51] <dabear> it was what you were asking for
[05:37:13] <dabear> or you need to specify more accurately what you want
[05:37:26] <dabear> and please try your self
[05:37:26] <Paveloosha> but i need to store whole HTML actually..
[05:37:40] <dabear> Paveloosha: api.jquery.com
[05:37:46] <dabear> Paveloosha: see ?html
[05:37:46] <bot-t> Paveloosha, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:38:11] <kurisu> asked elsewhere and apparently I will need js/jquery: how do I have a select element dropdown with initial text that is NOT an option itself... any ideas?
[05:38:36] <dabear> kurisu: ?demo
[05:38:41] <dabear> kurisu: see ?demo
[05:38:41] <bot-t> kurisu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:40:04] <Paveloosha> <dabear>,<bot-t>, I know how to get HTML from a element , please see my code "....imgSource[n] = $(this).html();" .. problem is I need it with parent structure.
[05:40:40] <dabear> Paveloosha: google for jquery outerhtml
[05:40:53] <sadmicrowave> morning
[05:43:14] <kurisu> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/QGfyE/1/
[05:43:33] <Paveloosha> <dabear>, I dont think it is complecated to much that I need to use a plugin.. okay let me think about the logic.. Thanks a lot guys..
[05:43:49] <kurisu> dabear: I basically want the 'Filter By Member' option to be initial text and not an option itself
[05:44:07] <dabear> Paveloosha: .clone().wrap("<div/>").parent().html()
[05:44:11] <jeffsmykil> How do I save the contents of an XML file to a variable?
[05:44:19] <jeffsmykil> I just get back XML()
[05:45:28] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, maybe server-side would be better?
[05:45:55] <Paveloosha> <dabear>, Thanks that is what I was trying to know.. Thanks again
[05:46:05] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: I think I got it
[05:46:11] <jeffsmykil> i just have to figure out how to traverse it now
[05:46:16] <jeffsmykil> when it is saved as a variable
[05:48:11] <dabear> kurisu: dont think that is possible
[05:48:35] <dabear> you can fake it by removing the first option after it is clicked the first time
[05:48:42] <dabear> or something like that
[05:48:47] <dabear> or create your own input
[05:49:01] <kurisu> oh right
[05:49:19] <kurisu> is it possible to hide options?
[05:49:29] <kurisu> temporarily hide*
[05:49:59] <dabear> kurisu: see ?find
[05:50:00] <bot-t> kurisu, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:50:06] <dabear> and see ?detach
[05:50:06] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[05:50:22] <kurisu> thanks
[05:50:42] <sadmicrowave> kurisu, http://jsfiddle.net/QGfyE/2/
[05:51:42] <sadmicrowave> did I misunderstand?
[05:51:50] <dabear> you did
[05:52:02] <dabear> he wanted the input to have a value of foo
[05:52:25] <dabear> while there should not be an option "foo"
[05:53:09] <kurisu> yes, but that gives me a starting point
[05:53:12] <kurisu> thasnk
[05:53:16] <sadmicrowave> he wants floating text inside the select box?
[05:54:00] <sadmicrowave> *non-selectable text inside a selectbox
[05:54:41] <kurisu> no I just want to have the selectbox with initial text 'Filter By Member' that is not an option itself... to act like a label
[05:55:04] <kurisu> without having to have a seperate label
[05:55:18] <sadmicrowave> I guess I still don't understand what 'initial text' means
[05:55:56] <kurisu> the trext that is displayed in the selectbox... before the options are displayed
[05:56:29] <sadmicrowave> so change my last line to: $('select').prepend( opt );$('select').prepend( opt );
[05:56:33] <sadmicrowave> oops
[05:56:34] <sadmicrowave> just once
[05:56:35] <sadmicrowave> $('select').prepend( opt );

[06:00:20] <sadmicrowave> ppj
[06:00:21] <sadmicrowave> ooh*
[06:01:15] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: I cant use find on a variable?
[06:01:49] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, depends if the variable is a string or is structured
[06:01:52] <kurisu> yeah thats what I'm trying to do
[06:01:56] <Ankabout> Can I use jQuery to achieve this effect: http://tinypic.com/r/331263l/7   ?
[06:02:02] <dabear> kurisu: not possible
[06:02:05] <dabear> deal with it :)
[06:02:29] <sadmicrowave> kurisu, this is the best thing I can think of http://jsfiddle.net/QGfyE/7/
[06:02:42] <Ankabout> basically, the blue box is a div element containing the orange and the green divs
[06:02:43] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: how can I tell?
[06:02:49] <ralphholzmann> shichuan: /6
[06:02:53] <ralphholzmann> whooops
[06:02:55] <sadmicrowave> console.log( variable )
[06:03:00] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil,
[06:03:10] <Ankabout> but only what's in the red box should be visible. on clicking, it should slide up to an anchor point, so the next orange block is visible
[06:03:31] <jeffsmykil> it tells me it isn't a function sadmicrowave
[06:03:44] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, in what? jsfiddle?
[06:04:05] <jeffsmykil> yeah cant jsfidldle this :/
[06:04:05] <kurisu> sadmicrowave: that'll do for now... thanks
[06:04:19] <sadmicrowave> kurisu, sorry for the confusion
[06:05:35] <kurisu> no worries... got there in the end, very helpful, thanks
[06:05:50] <jeffsmykil> sadMicrowave when I mouse over the variable in FireBug it says "Document"
[06:06:38] <Pymous> Hello !
[06:06:47] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, whats the  method you are using to assign it to a variable?
[06:06:58] <Pymous> I'm trying to find a way to find the INDEX of a certain LI inside a UL
[06:07:00] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/36/
[06:07:12] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, how to determine that there is a reminder or not?
[06:07:17] <Pymous> I can find the .push, but not the index, it's always 0 :(
[06:07:19] <sadmicrowave> Pymous, .index()
[06:07:26] <Pymous> Yep, but with what selector ?
[06:07:55] <sadmicrowave> Pymous, $('li.push').index()
[06:08:06] <jeffsmykil> I just saved it as global variable sadmicrowave
[06:08:26] <jeffsmykil> int he success function
[06:08:27] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, saved what?
[06:08:59] <jeffsmykil> i just stored the xml document in a global variable in the success function of the ajax call
[06:09:18] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, so then it is most likely just a string
[06:10:10] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: how do i store it as somethingh i can use find with?
[06:10:51] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, I don't know anything about XML unfortunately but with an html content string I would do: var myVar = $( string ); which will convert the regular string to a structured element
[06:10:54] <jmar777> jeffsmykil: is your code posted somewhere? should be something like ... success: function(data) { $(data).find(...); } ...
[06:11:17] <Pymous> sadmicrowave > Here is my full ul (like in my website), and it's not working as intended :(
[06:11:18] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/37/
[06:11:46] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[06:11:54] <jmar777> Pymous: what's wrong with that?
[06:11:55] <mattyh88> hey, i have this line of code: http://pastebin.com/Ypp6zexB, it's telling me the ( isn't closed, it's expecting a ) symbol
[06:12:01] <sadmicrowave> Pymous, whats not working? it alerts( 2 ) for me...which is the index of the element you are searching for
[06:12:04] <mattyh88> but for me everything's closed?
[06:12:12] <kborchers> Pymous: that worked correctly for me. the index is 0 based so 2 is the correct index
[06:12:47] <Pymous> It's not giving me 2 Oo
[06:12:52] <kborchers> what browser?
[06:12:56] <Pymous> Oh wait
[06:13:00] <Pymous> wrong fiddle
[06:13:04] <Pymous> \o/
[06:13:24] <Pymous> kborchers > Here is the good one, sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/38/
[06:13:57] <jmar777> Pymous: you can't put the li's inside the a's
[06:13:59] <sadmicrowave> Pymous, because .push doesn't exist
[06:14:14] <sadmicrowave> oh wait sorry
[06:14:17] <kborchers> Pymous: you should not wrap your li's in a's
[06:14:27] <sadmicrowave> yea, you need to put your a's inside li's
[06:14:41] <kborchers> index is working properly there since the li has no siblings because it is in an a element
[06:15:29] <jmar777> Pymous: if you REALLY want to keep your markup like that (but seriously, don't :p), you could do your script like this: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/41/
[06:15:46] <Pymous> I will change so
[06:15:48] <Pymous> Thanks you :)
[06:15:54] <sadmicrowave> Pymous, this is the correct way:
[06:16:00] <sadmicrowave> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/42/
[06:16:43] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, sorry I couldn't be more help, I've never had a need to do anything with XML...
[06:16:57] <oly_> hi, can anyone tell me if there is a way to detect if an element has a bound event ?
[06:17:05] <jeffsmykil> no worries
[06:17:38] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: can you repost your original issue, i missed it. there is almost always a better solution than storing something in a global
[06:17:42] <jmar777> oly_: i think you can do something like $('.foo').data('events')
[06:18:21] <jeffsmykil> kborchers I need to store this XML file as a global variable so i can access it throughout my call instead of making ajax calls over and over again for data that isnt changing
[06:19:21] <jmar777> oly_: http://jsfiddle.net/em6Ve/
[06:19:25] <oly_> jmar777, cheers i will try that out
[06:19:38] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: but when I do that I try and use foo.find("blach") I get foo.find is not a function
[06:19:51] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: hmmm, i guess without seeing your code it would be hard to suggest something better. what are you doing with this xml that can't all be handled in the success callback of the ajax call?
[06:20:23] <jeffsmykil> kborchers i use the ml in a lot of diferent functions
[06:20:44] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: if you have to store it as a string and then try to find stuff in it later see ?parseXML
[06:20:45] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, jQuery.parseXML() - Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[06:21:01] <jeffsmykil> ty
[06:21:13] <kborchers> you could just do that when you get it and store it as an object rather than a string
[06:21:31] <JAAulde> g'morning jQuerians
[06:22:45] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: uncaught exception: Invalid XML: [object XMLDocument]
[06:22:58] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: then your XML is not well formed
[06:23:01] <ottorinde> good afternoon for me :)
[06:23:13] * jeffsmykil goes to validate
[06:23:42] <JAAulde> ottorinde: http://www.total-knowledge.com/~ilya/mips/ugt.html
[06:23:48] <mattyh88> if i use the append function but this holds alot of HTML so it splits up in more than 1 line in the HTML source code, does the append function expects the closing ) to be on the same line as the ( symbol?
[06:24:59] <ottorinde> jaaulde: hehe, nice :)
[06:25:07] <JAAulde> :)
[06:25:08] <jeffsmykil> kborchers it validates but with a doctype warning
[06:25:14] <frrril> hey guys, does anyone have any experience with sfwobject by any chance? I'm having an odd problem where I'm passing flash vars but in some browsers the strings get outputted one character a line, in other browsers it comes out just fine
[06:25:16] <jmar777> mattyh88: no, splitting lines should be fine, as long as it's still valid JS syntax
[06:25:34] <mattyh88> jmar777: i think it is: http://pastebin.com/Ypp6zexB
[06:25:43] <oquidave> hello guys...i want to toggle two functions on click.
[06:25:57] <oquidave> i have tried somthg like....$(j_div).toggle(plus(j_div_plus, j_div_minus), minus(j_div_plus, j_div_minus));
[06:26:16] <frrril> why don't you just make the toggle trigger a function that triggers all the functions you want?
[06:27:10] <jmar777> mattyh88: it depends on what your templating engine is emitting. if there are new lines inside of the generated string literal, then yes, that won't work
[06:27:31] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: hmm, not sure. does your string have the <?xml.... ? You might try removing that so that you only have matching open/close tags ... just a guess though
[06:27:34] <oquidave> frrril, yeah but each click should trigger a diff fn each time
[06:27:53] <mattyh88> jmar777: what could be another approach to do this? :)
[06:28:08] <mattyh88> jmar777: loading this whole partial into that div
[06:28:29] <mattyh88> cuz the partial is pretty big
[06:28:31] <jmar777> write a php function that will encode the partial as a javascript string
[06:28:45] <frrril> oquidave based on ehwat?
[06:29:17] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: the reason i say try that is because the example in the docs shows an rss string without the <?xml declaration
[06:29:51] <mattyh88> jmar777: have you got an example of that please?
[06:29:58] <mattyh88> is it like json_encode but then javascript_encode?
[06:30:18] <jeffsmykil> yeah kborchers I saw that
[06:30:19] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[06:30:25] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: in your ajax call, are you specifying dataType: "xml" ? That would probably get rid of all of these issues
[06:30:35] <kborchers> then it would return an actual xml doc
[06:30:45] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[06:31:10] <oquidave> frrril, i have a dropdown that expands and collapses on each click....when collapsing, the button shld be a plus(function 1) and when expanding button is a minus(function 2)
[06:31:17] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: yeah, meaning that is what you are doing?
[06:31:25] <jeffsmykil> yes sir
[06:31:32] <jeffsmykil> oh fuck this is only available in 1.5
[06:31:36] <jeffsmykil> that means upgrade
[06:31:46] <kborchers> yep
[06:32:07] <jeffsmykil> yeah bt im using 1.5.1
[06:32:15] <James-_> http://jsfiddle.net/7wNyJ/2/   why when i click on repondre : always same value
[06:32:30] <kborchers> hmm
[06:33:50] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: what does your success callback look like? something like success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {.... ? And then the data should be a valid XML doc
[06:34:23] <jeffsmykil> k borchers
[06:34:24] <jeffsmykil> success: function (xml) {
[06:34:24] <jeffsmykil> 			        var cachedXML = jQuery.parseXML(xml);
[06:34:24] <jeffsmykil> 			        getWidth();
[06:34:24] <jeffsmykil> 			    },
[06:34:39] <jeffsmykil> sorry about that folks
[06:34:52] <erichynds> if dataType is set to xml, it already comes back as an xml doc
[06:35:06] <James-_> http://jsfiddle.net/7wNyJ/2/   why when i click on repondre : always same value ?
[06:35:19] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: yeah but i need to store it as a global variable
[06:35:41] <erichynds> you don't need to re-parse it with $.parseXML
[06:36:07] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: apology accepted ;) have you tried just storing XML and then doing a find on it? if you console.log(xml) does it look like a string or an object?
[06:36:42] <jeffsmykil> string
[06:36:55] <MrNibbles> hmm, anyone know if theres a good alternative to charles for re-directing external web resources to local?
[06:37:03] <MrNibbles> i'm fed up of its high CPU usage
[06:37:10] <MrNibbles> a nine little command line tool would be excellent
[06:39:10] <frrril> equidave use .addClass and .removeClass functions to change the picture on the dropdown, you only need one on change function that checks the toggle state of the dropdown before executing the appropriate code
[06:39:21] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: I fet tgus
[06:39:22] <jeffsmykil> cachedXML.find is not a function
[06:39:23] <erichynds> MrNibbles: use your hosts file
[06:39:42] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: try $(cachedXML).find()
[06:39:43] <MrNibbles> erichynds: i don't think i can do that for single files though can i?
[06:40:00] <erichynds> ah, negative
[06:40:01] <MrNibbles> i can re-direct a domain, but not a particular file
[06:40:09] <ablomen> MrNibbles, in firefox you also have foxyproxy, that should be able to do it
[06:40:10] <jeffsmykil> why its not a jquery object is it?
[06:40:22] <MrNibbles> ablomen: ah, ill give that a go
[06:40:23] <James-_> kborchers ?
[06:40:27] <MrNibbles> ablomen: similar for chrome?
[06:40:27] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: $.parseXML returns an XML document, which is not a jquery object
[06:40:42] <jeffsmykil> huh
[06:40:49] <erichynds> you can do $($.parseXML())
[06:40:49] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: that seems to have done it
[06:40:53] <jeffsmykil> I think
[06:40:59] <ablomen> MrNibbles, maybe, google will know i guess
[06:41:14] <James-_> http://jsfiddle.net/7wNyJ/2/ ?
[06:41:35] <James-_> oups http://jsfiddle.net/7wNyJ/4/
[06:42:55] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: the errors are gone, just seems like it isnt traversing the xml properly now
[06:43:01] <erichynds> o rly
[06:43:23] <jeffsmykil> let me try a known good find statement
[06:43:30] <kborchers> James-_: id's must be unique. what you are doing will never work.
[06:43:53] <James-_> hum ?
[06:44:01] <James-_> how can i do that ?
[06:45:37] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: I was missing a space
[06:45:42] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: pretty typical lol
[06:45:53] <jeffsmykil> thnak you erichynds, kborchers, and sadmicrowave for your help
[06:46:16] <James-_> kborchers i don t understand, for have different value how can i do that so ?
[06:46:25] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: yeah, sorry i missed the conversion to jq object. good catch erichynds
[06:47:23] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: any help is apprceciated as long as it is well meaning
[06:47:30] <kborchers> :)
[06:48:32] <jeffsmykil> no one likes this xml crap, its hard ;)
[06:49:17] <James-_> kborchers so lol ?
[06:51:25] <kborchers> James-_: i made some changes to your html (changed some id's to classes, renamed a class, removed a bunch of those divs to simplify) and then modified the js to illustrate what to do. that should get you on the right track i hope. http://jsfiddle.net/7wNyJ/5/
[06:55:51] <James-_> ok, i look that , thank you
[06:57:40] <necrodearia> Without using any effects, jquery 1.4.2 and 1.6.2 (from google) show "jQuery.effects is undefined"
[06:57:58] <necrodearia> e.g. <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[06:58:42] <Brodingo> necrodearia demo? code?
[06:58:47] <jomofcw> necrodearia those script doesn't "call" anything
[06:58:50] <jeffsmykil> man notepad++ syntax highlighting for javascript is terrible
[06:58:52] <jomofcw> It is just declaration
[06:59:06] <huma> how do i check request data with jquery's autocomplete widget?
[07:01:54] <James-_> ok it s good kborchers thanks a lot :)
[07:01:54] <kborchers> np
[07:04:36] <necrodearia> jomofcw, I figured out the issue.

[07:08:58] <ajpiano> no that's how data's work in javascript
[07:09:06] <ajpiano> ...
[07:09:37] <Brodingo> the hell
[07:10:07] <oquidave> hello...doesn't $(this).toggle(fn1(), fn2()); toggle between two functions each time of clicking?
[07:10:31] <ajpiano> oquidave: no,  $(this).toggle(fn1, fn2) does
[07:10:44] <ajpiano> don't execute the functions instead of passing them by reference :)
[07:12:38] <oquidave> ajpiano, then how do i pass arguments to fn1 or fn2 ?
[07:13:53] <ajpiano> oquidave: you could either do .toggle( function() { fn1("a", "b")}, , function() { fn2("c", "d");  })
[07:14:03] <Sengoku> hey
[07:14:05] <ajpiano> or you could use currying to bake the arguments into the function
[07:14:08] <Sengoku> http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/ext-4.0.0/examples/writer/writer.html
[07:14:15] <Sengoku> Anyone know of a plugin similar to the above
[07:14:34] <oquidave> ajpiano, okay thanks let me try that
[07:14:50] <Sengoku> MIT/Apache licensed though
[07:16:16] <randomn1c> Hi guys.
[07:16:39] <randomn1c> $("#element").css('left'); will return me the position with a 'px' value like "200px", is there a way of getting it as an integer?
[07:16:46] <randomn1c> Other than just throwing it through parseInt / parseFloat?
[07:17:00] <StPiere> i have multiple elements with somd id's and want to append some text to each of them
[07:17:16] <marcocarag> random1c try offset()
[07:17:32] <StPiere> $('#id1', '#id2').each(function() { $(this).appen("somethind"})
[07:17:40] <erichynds> ?eval parseInt( "200px", 10 ); @ randomn1c
[07:17:41] <bot-t> randomn1c: 200
[07:17:44] <StPiere> but this doesnt seem to work
[07:18:14] <kborchers> ?position @ randomn1c
[07:18:24] <bot-t> randomn1c, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[07:18:35] <StPiere> anyone?
[07:19:50] <kborchers> StPiere: i think what you want is $('#id1, #id2').each(function() { $(this).appen("somethind"})
[07:20:04] <randomn1c> Hmm
[07:20:49] <StPiere> kborchers, yes that's what i also wrote
[07:21:12] <kborchers> StPiere: no, notice the difference in the quotes in the selector
[07:21:17] <StPiere> kborchers, i see now
[07:21:19] <StPiere> thank you
[07:21:23] <kborchers> np
[07:21:51] <ajpiano> also you don't need .each there
[07:21:58] <ajpiano> $("#foo, #bar").append("wassup baz");
[07:21:58] * kborchers cries for bot-t
[07:24:06] <marcocarag> yo ajpiano
[07:24:12] <ajpiano> sup marcocarag
[07:25:11] <randomn1c> Thanks for the help guys. My problem was elsewhere :)
[07:27:31] <randomn1c> Guys when using the data method (http://api.jquery.com/data/) does jQuery store that data in memory or does it have to look through the DOM tree on retrieval? i.e.: is it fast?
[07:27:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's fast
[07:27:59] <Aristata1> So append sticks an element in last inside a container right?
[07:28:02] <aaronmcadam> it stores it on a data property
[07:28:16] <Aristata1> How can I insert an element on the same level directly before an element?
[07:28:31] <aaronmcadam> ?before @ Aristata1
[07:28:50] <aaronmcadam> .before Aristata1
[07:28:58] <kborchers> Aristata1: http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[07:29:09] <aaronmcadam> so annoyin when bot-t is away
[07:29:21] <aaronmcadam> does temp01 run it off his machine?
[07:29:22] <kborchers> yep
[07:29:35] <tbranyen> who?
[07:29:38] <aaronmcadam> we should get it on a server
[07:29:58] <aaronmcadam> I want to run it myself for my company's channel too
[07:31:29] <ajpiano> unfortunately it's been several months since temp01 has spoken in irc channel so... glwtd :/
[07:31:36] <aaronmcadam> aw :(
[07:31:49] <aaronmcadam> is the bot-t server available anywhere ajpiano ?
[07:31:53] <ajpiano> nope
[07:31:57] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[07:32:25] <jeffsmykil> can you not use nth-child in a find?
[07:32:36] <aaronmcadam> filter?
[07:32:36] <jeffsmykil> areasOnFloor.push($(cachedXML).find("facility areas room:nth-child('" + i + "') type").text());
[07:33:11] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[07:33:19] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone recognise what e-commerce platform this is ? http://www.appleyardpress.com/
[07:33:25] <aaronmcadam> but i love bot-t I want to adopt him :(
[07:33:51] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, are facility, areas, room, type classes? or id's? or etc.?
[07:34:09] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: nodes
[07:34:17] <sadmicrowave> oh yea xml I forgot
[07:34:45] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: you must stay up to date with everything im doing at all TIMES!
[07:34:55] <sadmicrowave> yes master
[07:35:46] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:35:52] <aaronmcadam> get a room lads :D
[07:36:04] <aaronmcadam> #welovejeff
[07:36:17] * sadmicrowave joined #welovejeff
[07:36:26] <jeffsmykil> anyways it does not like nth-child
[07:36:30] <oquidave> ajpiano, i have tried doing what you adviced but am still not getting desired results...kindly look at my code here, thanks...http://pastebin.com/n8ZfDsbr
[07:36:36] <sadmicrowave> wtf its just a bunch of naked pictures in here!!
[07:37:18] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, I'm not sure hot it would handle nodes but I think nth-child() works with .find() normally....: /
[07:37:30] <ajpiano> um
[07:37:43] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: did u try filter?
[07:37:46] <oquidave> ajpiano, am working on a collapsable div that shows and hides stuff, each time displaying the plus and minus sign
[07:37:50] <jeffsmykil> no
[07:37:52] <ajpiano> oquidave: not sure why this wouldnt' work, but i have a general sense from this code that you could just like, quickly toggle a class instead of having these crazy classes
[07:37:57] <ajpiano> i mean these crazy functions
[07:38:02] <ajpiano> that do all this unnecessary traversal
[07:38:05] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: I am looping though
[07:38:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:39:15] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano knows, hes just playing hard to get
[07:39:24] <ajpiano>  i don't  "know"
[07:39:27] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:39:29] <ajpiano> my suggestion is what it always is
[07:39:32] <ajpiano> DEBUG
[07:39:32] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, are the nodes listed in your .find() child nodes? or sibling nodes?
[07:39:42] <jeffsmykil> child
[07:39:43] <oquidave> ajpiano, okay thanks
[07:39:53] <ajpiano> first see if you can get the first elements
[07:39:54] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I just like to see you write it
[07:39:57] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: have you heard of this site? fixingthesejquery.com :p
[07:40:09] <ajpiano> or get the collection of nodes, without filtering by nth-child
[07:40:18] <ajpiano> see if that collection is not empty
[07:40:18] <ajpiano> etc.
[07:40:48] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, does this work? : $("facility areas room:nth-child('" + i + "')", cachedXML).find("type").text()
[07:40:48] <jeffsmykil> its not empty it just doesnt like the nth-child apparently
[07:40:49] <aaronmcadam> do you have no control over the xml?
[07:41:05] <jeffsmykil> comma?
[07:41:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah, context
[07:41:29] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: changing it to use sel, context isn't gonna like, have any material effect on the selector
[07:41:54] <jeffsmykil> its giving a syntax error now
[07:42:01] <jeffsmykil> so i must be doing something right
[07:42:06] <jeffsmykil> thats how it works right?
[07:42:09] <sadmicrowave> didn't think so, unless .find() didn't like the nth-child() function...in which case putting it in sel context would help
[07:42:15] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, ^
[07:42:38] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: $("foo", context) is just converted to $(context).find("foo")
[07:42:48] <aaronmcadam> woop
[07:42:57] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, I didn't it was converted
[07:43:01] <sadmicrowave> cool, then nvm
[07:43:16] <jeffsmykil> oh found the problem
[07:43:24] <sadmicrowave> oh DO tell!
[07:43:31] <jeffsmykil> it was dumb
[07:43:39] <jeffsmykil> i forgot to delete  a line of code
[07:43:42] <TrueColors> http://178.78.82.127/projects/clients/Jeanette_Clement/FireWalkTake2/register.php submit the form, it does absolutely nothing (it's ajax powered), it's suppose to show an alert of 'data' which is in the $.post success section.
[07:43:44] <TrueColors> but it's not doing it
[07:43:49] <TrueColors> it's annoying me
[07:44:15] <aaronmcadam> sadmicrowave: give this a quick look, covers some of stuff about what jq actually does http://www.slideshare.net/AddyOsmani/jquery-performance-tips-and-tricks-2011
[07:44:40] <intellilogic> http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/C3yG8/16/  How come I am not getting all the information from my hidden fields?
[07:45:22] <jeffsmykil> i dont think you can get value on hidden fields
[07:45:27] <jeffsmykil> I dont think it works that way
[07:45:35] <ajpiano> huh
[07:45:46] <jeffsmykil> but ajpiano will tell you the right answer soon
[07:46:06] <aaronmcadam> um
[07:46:12] <aaronmcadam> that makes no sense lol
[07:46:31] <aaronmcadam> intellilogic: are you using form.serialize()?
[07:46:40] <ajpiano> intellilogic: you might want to look into using .serialize()
[07:46:44] <TrueColors> http://178.78.82.127/projects/clients/Jeanette_Clement/FireWalkTake2/register.php - why won't this form do anything when I submit?
[07:47:07] <ajpiano> intellilogic: the actual problem is that your hidden inputs don't have name properties
[07:47:20] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: the amount of times I've seen people manually building params
[07:47:43] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: yainorite, it makes you want to slit your throat and then use the blood as a marinade for poultry or steak
[07:47:46] <aaronmcadam> ah simples then
[07:47:51] <_bart> If I do $(this).html($(this).html().substring(0, charselect)+"</p><p>"+$(this).html().substring(charselect)); and tell you that $(this) is a <p>  will only the "first half" get a class if I do $(this).addClass("batch") after that code?
[07:47:55] <aaronmcadam> lol maybe not that extreme :D
[07:48:14] <aaronmcadam> maybe slice a unicorn or something
[07:48:27] <aaronmcadam> but leave that wonderful fro alone lol
[07:48:51] <ajpiano> TrueColors: it's breaking because you say the type is json and you aren't serving json back
[07:49:02] <ajpiano> success callback doesn't fire if you request json and you don't give back valid json
[07:49:12] <TrueColors> oh
[07:49:18] <ajpiano> TrueColors: if you were debugging your xhrs you'd see that in fact, it's making TWO ajax requests
[07:49:21] <ajpiano> on every submit :/
[07:49:28] <TrueColors> yeah I noticed that too
[07:49:30] <TrueColors> I have no idea why though
[07:49:36] <ajpiano> um
[07:49:44] <ajpiano> cause you said "when you click the submit button, force the form to submit"
[07:49:55] <TrueColors> well it's a button
[07:49:57] <TrueColors> <button>
[07:50:02] <ajpiano> sooo
[07:50:06] <ajpiano> use button type="submit"
[07:50:07] <ajpiano> instead
[07:50:35] <TrueColors> i need the js to actually submit the form because those with it disabled, it'll just... not work
[07:50:39] <_bart> if $(this) is a <p> and I do $(this).html($(this).html()+"</p><p>something</p>"); what would $(this).html contain after that? :)
[07:50:42] <SnackWhack> can someone show me how I could make a form submit button blink different colors when some other action occurs, like clicking on a link. The event doesn't matter, I'm just not sure how to make the button blink
[07:50:49] <ajpiano> TrueColors:you don't need js to make a submit button submit a form
[07:51:05] <TrueColors> it's not a submit button.
[07:51:07] <TrueColors> it's just a button
[07:51:10] <ajpiano> TrueColors: also you always want to put a type attr on your buttons
[07:51:24] <ajpiano> otherwise it defaults to submit in IE and then you get things that you don't want submitting forms submitting forms, etc
[07:51:46] <ajpiano> so either button type="button" or type="submit"
[07:51:50] <noaXess> $(".selector").dialog("isOpen") only work if the dialog is open.. right?
[07:52:07] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, slide 14, does that work with $.attr() also?
[07:52:08] <aaronmcadam> that looks a bit awful lol
[07:52:10] <TrueColors> that might be why.
[07:52:11] <noaXess> if no dialog is created and a run abiove.. i get the whole element definition
[07:52:13] <TrueColors> i need <button type="button">
[07:53:18] <aaronmcadam> watchoo talkin bout sadmicrowave, does what work
[07:53:25] <aaronmcadam> can't find what ur lookin at brooo
[07:53:34] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, sorry, the link you shared with me
[07:53:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah i kno
[07:53:42] <aaronmcadam> but can't find the slide
[07:54:02] <aaronmcadam> attaching data?
[07:54:05] <sadmicrowave> yea
[07:54:05] <_bart> why is everybody ignoring my question?
[07:54:14] <aaronmcadam> that code looks rough
[07:54:22] <aaronmcadam> that's why heh
[07:54:26] <intellilogic> ajpiano: Oh shit, thanks, that's what happens when I copy past right quick, heh.
[07:54:27] <ajpiano> _bart:  you don't have to do that to do that
[07:54:39] <sadmicrowave> I'm just wondering if $.attr('#item', key, value) is faster then $('#item').attr(key, value);
[07:54:45] <_bart> ajpiano: that isn't really an answer?
[07:54:51] <ajpiano> _bart: you can do $(this).html( function(html) { return html + "new string";    });
[07:54:52] <aaronmcadam> oh
[07:54:54] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, ^ *faster than
[07:55:11] <aaronmcadam> sadmicrowave: i think, the $.methods are usually faster than $.fn.methods
[07:55:15] <aaronmcadam> in general
[07:55:23] <aaronmcadam> might be differences, could be wrong
[07:55:26] <sadmicrowave> iiinnnntterrrestttinnnnggggg
[07:55:30] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: the first one is invalid syntax
[07:55:35] <SnackWhack> Here's is the basic code. I just need the submit button to blink a different color a few times when the link is clicked: http://jsfiddle.net/LuPb3/
[07:55:39] <_bart> ajpiano: but still, the real code is: $(this).html($(this).html().substring(0, charselect)+"</p><p>"+$(this).html().substring(charselect)); and after that: $(this).addClass("batch");
[07:55:41] <ajpiano> the first arg $.data sig is DOM element, not selector
[07:55:48] <_bart> ajpiano: will only the first <p> get the class or both or what happens?
[07:55:57] <aaronmcadam> I think he meant to put it as an obj literal
[07:56:03] <ajpiano> _bart:  same technique applies, you can use the function setter to get the current html and modify it in some way
[07:56:22] <aaronmcadam> he's talking about $.attr tho, what's the story there?
[07:56:24] <ajpiano> _bart: only the original element ('this') will get the class
[07:56:34] <_bart> ajpiano: thanks, that's the answer
[07:56:36] <ajpiano> you may have changed the content but you didn't change the physical selection itself
[07:58:24] <jeffsmykil> Im really confused why eq isnt working on these nodes
[07:59:27] <austinbv> anyone know a better way to do this so I don't need to use sync https://gist.github.com/1170807
[07:59:38] <aaronmcadam> ajax code?
[08:00:39] <ajpiano> austinbv: you can leverage the fact that ajax is observable and returns a promise
[08:00:53] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: areasOnFloor.push($(cachedXML).find("facility areas room type ").text());  works
[08:00:57] <jeffsmykil> but areasOnFloor.push($(cachedXML).find("facility areas room:eq('" +i+"') type ").text()); does not
[08:01:24] <ajpiano> function get_total( trend, duration) { return $.ajax();    }   $.when( get_total( "foo", 5 ) ) .then(function() { });
[08:01:24] * jeffsmykil has an idea
[08:01:24] <austinbv> ajpiano: what do you mean
[08:02:17] <NickASloan> if I set a submit handler, the button I click to submit the form should be included when I call .serialize(), right?
[08:02:43] <aaronmcadam> a you're the deferred master ajpiano  :)
[08:03:16] <austinbv> use something like when?
[08:03:18] <ajpiano> not really
[08:03:25] <ajpiano> austinbv: not something "like" when
[08:03:34] <austinbv> use when :)
[08:04:38] <danzik17> ajpiano: Doesn't ajax already return a promise?  Why add 'when' to that since it's already a promise object?
[08:04:49] <ajpiano> danzik17: more explcit for example purposes
[08:04:54] <ajpiano> danzik17 is correct though
[08:04:56] <danzik17> ajpiano: Ahh ok
[08:05:04] <ajpiano> you could just do get_total( args, argzzz).then(fn);
[08:10:13] <austinbv> ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/1170807 still returns all 0
[08:10:23] <austinbv> I would asume I am using when then wrong
[08:10:32] <SnackWhack> Still can't get it... tried several things: http://jsfiddle.net/LuPb3/19/ How can I make the submit button blink?
[08:10:33] <ajpiano> uhm... yeah
[08:10:33] <ajpiano> you are
[08:10:48] <ajpiano> austinbv: you don't get to get the value of something async as a return value from the function that triggers it
[08:11:02] <ajpiano> you have to ackowledge the async nature of the program
[08:11:33] <ajpiano> so like, you'd call get_total() from your code and  use .then() to bind a callback for when it returns
[08:11:42] <ajpiano> without having to apply the callback *at* the time you make the call
[08:12:40] <austinbv> so the call back cannot be abstracted the same way the call can?
[08:12:55] <ajpiano> it can, you could pass the functoin in as an arg
[08:13:09] <ajpiano> but you don't need to because you can just late-bind it in the abstraction
[08:14:12] <austinbv> ok
[08:15:12] <_bart> if $(this) is a <p>something</p> how do I add an element after that </p>?
[08:15:26] <ajpiano> .after()
[08:15:30] <_bart> Because .append would add it inside the $(this) at the end, but I
[08:15:31] <_bart> ah
[08:15:31] <austinbv> _bart: .after
[08:15:32] <_bart> okay
[08:16:02] <austinbv> so ajpiano what do you want the get_total() to return then?
[08:16:08] <ajpiano> you return $.ajax();
[08:16:21] <austinbv> ok
[08:16:34] <_bart> http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Search?ns0=1&search=after&go= :s
[08:16:41] <austinbv> then handle all responses in the then
[08:17:02] <ajpiano> ostensibly
[08:17:16] <ajpiano> _bart: http://api.jquery.com/after
[08:17:38] <_bart> ajpiano: yeah, why doesn't the search work?
[08:17:46] <austinbv> that means you cannot loop through calls like I do
[08:18:10] <ajpiano> you're searching the wrong site
[08:18:18] <ajpiano> docs.jquery is kinda old and busted and going away, use api.jquery
[08:20:29] <vviljanen> I'm planning to write my Master's thesis on subject related to jQuery. Does someone have any good refrence books or articles to recommend?
[08:21:35] <gf3> vviljanen: really?
[08:21:37] <SnackWhack> surely can't be this difficult to blink a submit button... ugg
[08:21:44] <gf3> SnackWhack: don't
[08:21:46] <vviljanen> most of the books just tell how to use jQuery methods and stuff, but I would like to have something different.. More scientific.
[08:21:47] <gf3> SRSLY
[08:21:56] <vviljanen>  why not :)
[08:22:07] <gf3> vviljanen: because there's not that much to it
[08:22:13] <ajpiano> vviljanen: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-talk-at-northeastern/
[08:22:24] <vviljanen> gf3: sure there is
[08:22:50] <erichynds> jquery is a revolution system
[08:22:51] <gf3> vviljanen: ORLY?
[08:22:54] <vviljanen> ajpiano: thanks, i'll take a look
[08:22:58] <ajpiano> i don't know if there's enough to write a master's thesis on
[08:22:59] <SnackWhack> gf3: I know it's ugly, but I still want to do it :)
[08:23:11] <jbrokc> how would i add an event listener for when a dom element changes the value of it's "display" style? $("#foo").live("css.display", "none", function() { â€¦ } ) or something similar.. ?
[08:23:12] <gf3> SnackWhack: don't make me ban your site from the internet
[08:23:23] <vviljanen> well ofcourse it won't be only about jQuery, but somehow related to it
[08:23:31] <SnackWhack> gf3: You would need some serious skeeelz and a botnet
[08:23:50] <gf3> SnackWhack: or a master key
[08:23:54] <SnackWhack> gf3: besides, it's on an intranet, and it will blink because my users are morons
[08:24:12] <gf3> SnackWhack: I promise you there is a better way
[08:24:28] <austinbv> so then ajpiano building the defered request becomes the issue, how do you request a dynamic number of urls and defer waiting for all to complete
[08:25:03] <ajpiano> austinbv: you can do $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).then(function( data1, data2, data3) {})
[08:25:29] <gf3> vviljanen: I don't know, man. An entire thesis on cross-browser DOM abstraction sounds very dry, also there really isn't much to write about.
[08:25:37] <SnackWhack> gf3: so, when a user attempts to navigate away from a page, I want to pop up an alert and say "Are you sure you want to navigate away form this page without submitting the form?" and then blink the submit button if they choose to cancel navigation
[08:25:43] <gf3> Unless you talk about the history of front-end development, vviljanen.
[08:25:47] <SnackWhack> gf3: so what would you recommend?
[08:25:48] <austinbv> but for a dynamic number of ajax requests building the arguments without eval seems... impossible
[08:25:55] <Geneller> hi there, i got a problem, i've a string with the generic html for some fields, i need to change the attribute name dynamicly, i got that, i show these fields in a thickbox and  when i send the fields to a parent form i clone current html to some hidden div inside of the parent form and write a TR with a few of these values in a table as a preview of the details, everything works just fine...
[08:25:57] <Geneller> ...as i need it, now my boss is asking me to click this TR and show again the entered data and make it editable, but when i show de cloned div it appears EMPTY!!! it does not keep visible any of the entered values, when i submit the form with the hidden div i got all the entered data, please any clue
[08:26:03] <ajpiano> austinbv: $.when.apply(null, arrayOfDeferreds).then(fn);
[08:26:52] <gf3> SnackWhack: well I think just the popup is sufficient in that case
[08:26:52] <gf3> SnackWhack: an even better solution is to auto-save the form data, or persist it through requests
[08:27:23] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I need to extend jquery with a simple plugin... I'm creating a method foo() and I'll pass foo a class.. for example $('.myClass').foo(); myClass is applied to an h1, why in the plugin with this[0] I get all h1 instead of only 'myClass' objects?
[08:27:37] <SnackWhack> gf3: This is built on an older technology using canned PL/SQL packages. Modifying baseline code and tables is a BAD idea due to upgrades. So propoagtion isn't going to happen
[08:27:46] <Geneller> anyone ?
[08:27:56] <SnackWhack> gf3: And auto save isn't always good. Sometimes they shouldn't save the data
[08:28:02] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: you can persist that type of shit in localstorage or a cookie
[08:28:08] <gf3> â†‘
[08:28:09] <austinbv> never would have thought of apply thats clever thank ajpiano
[08:28:37] <vviljanen> gf3: I haven't decided my subject yet, just trying to find something interesting to write and research
[08:28:48] <gf3> vviljanen: well good luck
[08:28:58] <SnackWhack> ok, well, I have a solution for now. I'll do the popup. I'll look into persisting the data using cookies. bbiab
[08:29:06] <vviljanen> of course the subject can't be just "jQuery"
[08:29:37] <gf3> SnackWhack: localstorage!
[08:29:43] <Geneller> hello ?
[08:30:11] <gf3> Geneller: TL;DR
[08:30:47] <vviljanen> a friend of mine is going to write about client side software testing, there is forexample jquery related subject.
[08:31:07] <SnackWhack> gf3: That still uses cookies. And that scares me a bit because there are several computers in computer labs that will be using these. Which means cookie data with sensitive data in them could be stored, and used inappropriately
[08:31:11] <vviljanen> I was planning something similat, but haven't found out yet what would it be.
[08:31:24] <gf3> SnackWhack: bro
[08:31:44] <gf3> SnackWhack: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage
[08:32:12] <gf3> SnackWhack: you have your choice of k/v stores and databases
[08:32:17] <gf3> you can go all out
[08:32:43] <SnackWhack> gf3: hmmmm, I'll definitely read up on that! I'm not familiar with it. Off to research!
[08:32:51] <gf3> SnackWhack: http://html5demos.com/storage
[08:33:24] <SnackWhack> thanks gf3 and ajpiano
[08:33:27] <SnackWhack> bbiab
[08:33:33] <gf3> GLHF
[08:36:44] <austinbv> ajpiano: and in the then function again creating a dynamic number of the arguements
[08:39:37] <Geneller> gf3: basicly, clone a form and its data, hide it and when i click some tag show it again with the enterded data
[08:40:21] <gf3> Geneller: cool, j/w why do you need to clone it?
[08:40:35] <austinbv> I am really not understanding the concept of defereing the request
[08:40:35] <versatiletech> anyone use jasmine?
[08:41:24] <Geneller> gf3: because its a dynamic form
[08:41:31] <ajpiano> austinbv this might help http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/
[08:41:47] <Geneller> gf3: i need to add some details to the main form
[08:41:59] <austinbv> thanks ajpiano
[08:43:00] <Geneller> gf3: but after some event, show again the form with the entered data, my problem: when i show again the form i doesn't have the data
[08:43:58] <jbrokc> how do i add a listentener on an element for when a class changes?
[08:44:03] <jbrokc> or gets added, whatever
[08:45:14] <gf3> Geneller: you'll need to use something like this: http://www.keyframesandcode.com/resources/javascript/jQuery/demos/populate-demo.html
[08:45:31] <gf3> Geneller: serialize your form data, clone your form, repopulate
[08:48:20] <Geneller> i'll try it, tks
[08:49:36] <ale>  Does anyone know any alternative for eval() for math expressions?
[08:51:20] <versatiletech> ale: what type of math are you trying to do?
[08:51:41] <ale> Same as eval
[08:51:53] <ale> Or pretty similar
[08:52:07] <austinbv> eval isn't math
[08:52:48] <ale> but you can evaluate math functions
[08:52:59] <versatiletech> ale: yeah eval in javascript means translate this string into javascript code and run it
[08:53:01] <austinbv> you can also just run math
[08:53:10] <ale> I want something like this http://silentmatt.com/javascript-expression-evaluator/
[08:53:55] <pootpoot> would you eval a script string sent by php?
[08:55:26] <ale> No, just direct jquery
[08:57:13] <jkneb> hello has anybody ever experienced wrong values returned by .width() on a LIQUID div
[08:58:21] <Brak> cacts sucks cox
[08:58:34] <cacts> Brak, that is not very nice
[08:58:58] <Brak> cacts told me he would rather use YUI, burn him
[09:00:09] <ajpiano> you're the one who showed up in a channel and started insulting someone who wasn't even talking so uh
[09:00:13] <ajpiano> if anyone is gonna get burned....
[09:00:25] <Brak> you wanna take this outside
[09:01:13] <ajpiano> well... i can take .... you... outside...
[09:01:24] <Brak> ive killed for less.
[09:01:52] * ajpiano notifies authorities
[09:02:12] <Brak> :(
[09:02:36] <neybar> can I create elements and subelements in one line?  ex: $('<form><input></form>') I'm not getting any errors, but when I try to submit that element nothing happens.
[09:02:42] <_bart> Someone knows a better way to do this stuff: http://jsfiddle.net/ULSK9/2/ ?
[09:03:01] <_bart> I'm trying to split a <p> tags in 2 <p>'s to get the first one at a specific height (for example 70)
[09:03:08] <pootpoot> neybar: you need to append it
[09:04:10] <pootpoot> $('#content').append('<form><stuff></form>')
[09:04:20] <pootpoot> or prepend, or change the html
[09:09:16] <tktiddle> For some reason jquery is only defined as jQuery and not $ , how do i add jQuery to $ ?
[09:09:55] <pootpoot> jQuery(document).ready( function($) { });
[09:10:50] <Cork[home]> tktiddle: if you don't have $ its either cause .noConflict() has been run
[09:11:05] <Cork[home]> tktiddle: your your trying to run it in the browser console
[09:11:15] <Cork[home]> and some of them define $ them self
[09:11:26] * geekbuntu GAH! i just opened firefox and a webpage with cats in lingerie was there.... 
[09:11:38] <pootpoot> link
[09:11:43] * geekbuntu *loses self respect*
[09:11:55] <tktiddle> yeah im in browser console, but also i think the problem is there for the page itself
[09:12:05] <Cork[home]> ?g nyan cat
[09:12:25] <Cork[home]> bah the bot is gone...
[09:12:27] <pootpoot> tktiddle: if you add function($) like i did above, $ will be defined for things in that function
[09:12:45] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: na, thats over complicating it
[09:12:57] <Cork[home]> tktiddle: just to $=jQuery;
[09:13:30] <Cork[home]> to==do
[09:13:31] <tktiddle> Cork[home]: worth a try, perhaps it really is that simple
[09:13:37] <cacts> page Brak get back to work
[09:13:38] <Cork[home]> it is
[09:14:07] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: was it http://nyan.cat ? XD
[09:14:17] <cacts> http://slowbro.org
[09:14:19] * Cork[home] hates that site
[09:20:20] <jbrokc> does the jquery .change() event fire when an attribute of the dom element it's attached to changes? that is style, class, anything
[09:20:48] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: no its the native onchange event
[09:20:57] <Cork[home]> it triggers from form elements
[09:21:05] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: okay. do you know of any way to do the latter with jquery?
[09:21:25] <jbrokc> i can't find an event for chrome / webkit that fires when a dom attr is modified (taht is, support for DOMAttrModified equivalent)
[09:21:33] <tktiddle> So my problem is this: noconfilict() has been called on jquery and then I'm trying to load $.ui.datepicker , which tries to extend $.ui .   I tried just adding $ = jquery at the top of the datepicker script but it didnt help
[09:22:40] <Cork[home]> tktiddle: the native ui widgets should be wrapped in a jquery safe scope
[09:22:51] <Cork[home]> those shouldn't have that problem
[09:23:29] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: thats the problem, the only way js can emulate events is with timers, and monitoring
[09:23:40] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: and as there is no dom event...
[09:25:19] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: setIntervar(function() { if($('select').attr('value') !== $('select').data('value')) { $('select').data('value', $('select').attr('value')); <do your stuff> } }, 1000);
[09:25:28] <Cork[home]> not exactly the prittiest code... :s
[09:25:36] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: right now i'm trying to understand the http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4562354/javascript-detect-if-event-lister-is-supported method
[09:25:56] <jbrokc> (but for jQuery, it uses addEventListener and attachEvent [ which would both translate to bind] )
[09:26:54] <DimmuR> I have downloaded latest jquery + latest jquery-ui (i checked all checkboxes) and i try to run jquery.tooltip but i get message "this._bind is not a function" any ideas how it can be solved?
[09:27:23] <ajpiano> DimmuR: tooltip isn't in jquery  ui 1.8.x
[09:27:34] <ajpiano> it's in 1.9 preview stuff which isn't released yet
[09:27:54] <DimmuR> is 1.9 stable enough to use it?
[09:28:21] <ajpiano> it's pretty stable but there's no "stable release"
[09:28:23] <ajpiano> so YMMV
[09:28:48] <DimmuR> thanks ajpiano
[09:32:04] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: i would prob detect it with document.createEvent instead
[09:32:19] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: could you code up a simple gist of what that might look like please?
[09:32:27] <Cork[home]> sure one min
[09:32:34] <ajpiano> jbrokc: in general, doing feature testing for event support with a library abstraction is not what one would call "advisable"
[09:32:48] <jbrokc> ajpiano: what would be a better alternative?
[09:32:58] <ajpiano> using native methods like cork suggested
[09:32:59] <jbrokc> to just use it as plain javascript?
[09:41:37] <lacrymology> is there a .slideOpen that works like .slideToggle, but only if it's "closed"?
[09:41:50] <tmayr> slideDown?
[09:44:33] <ggarri> hello people
[09:45:16] <ggarri> how Could I move a element just 10px left from the current position  ?
[09:46:45] <JesperA> + 10
[09:46:55] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: bah, it failed quite badly :s
[09:47:59] <ggarri> but
[09:48:11] <ggarri> If I want to change using jquery
[09:48:15] <ggarri> ?
[09:48:49] <ggarri> because I tried elem.css({'left':'+=10px'}) but it doesn't work
[09:49:27] <thepacmanfan> what does .clone().html() do?
[09:49:42] <thepacmanfan> how is that any different from .clone()?
[09:50:41] <kinesis> how do i overwrite the content of a div to "0 records found." if document.myForm.userEntry.value == '' ?
[09:50:42] <lacrymology> ggarri: that's not correct css
[09:50:54] <lacrymology> oh
[09:50:56] <lacrymology> nevermind me
[09:51:16] <lacrymology> ggarri: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510055/how-can-i-use-jquery-to-move-a-div-across-the-screen
[09:51:38] <ggarri> ok
[09:51:39] <ggarri> thxs
[09:51:47] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: it returns the text..
[09:52:00] <thepacmanfan> the text of what?
[09:52:07] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: the html string inside your element's copy
[09:52:31] <kinesis> $("#results").html("0 records.found");
[09:52:33] <kinesis> is that it?
[09:52:35] <thepacmanfan> doesn't just .clone() do that by default?
[09:52:59] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: I-m just guessing, but I'd say clone() creates a new element copied from the original one
[09:53:09] <thepacmanfan> ohh, ok.
[09:53:26] <thepacmanfan> and it returns null if it thinks there is nothing in my element?
[09:53:37] <thepacmanfan> (in the case of .clone().html())
[09:54:21] <lacrymology> hm.. if your element is <tag></tag> it returns the empty string, not null
[09:55:53] <thepacmanfan> .clone is returning [object Object]
[09:56:10] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: what are you .clone-ing?
[09:56:43] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: x.clone() should return the same as x (or rather, a copy of the original)
[09:57:54] <kinesis> can anyone tell me how to do this "/* will this work */" properly ?  --> http://pastebin.com/QBZrWjaX
[09:58:02] <thepacmanfan> Query('#print-container').clone().html()
[09:58:10] <thepacmanfan> err, missed the leading j
[09:58:46] <thepacmanfan> lacrymology, i am cloning the content of a Shadowbox modal box, to a print friendly page
[09:59:20] <thepacmanfan> i am using the code here: http://shadowbox-js.com/forum.html#nabble-td4783762
[09:59:44] <thepacmanfan> they used it for a single image... i am modifying it so it works with HTML also.
[09:59:48] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: and does jQuery("#print-container") return something nice? like [<div> stuff]?
[09:59:55] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: oh wait
[09:59:59] <lacrymology> you're doing what?
[10:00:01] <lacrymology> printing on the console?
[10:00:12] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: object Object is ok
[10:00:18] <thepacmanfan> demo the code here: http://www.amylinart.com/Kinetics/Kinetics_port.htm
[10:00:28] <thepacmanfan> click one of the items, then click the print button
[10:00:47] <thepacmanfan> the little print icon at the bottom of the shadowbox
[10:01:07] <thepacmanfan> it clones the image to a printable page, then opens the print dialog
[10:01:38] <lacrymology> kinesis: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[10:01:51] <thepacmanfan> this is a solution to the problem of content in the modal window not printing
[10:02:11] <thepacmanfan> hmm
[10:02:33] <kinesis> i dont get it what is that, lacry
[10:02:33] <thepacmanfan> so i'm selecting the element wrong?
[10:03:03] <thepacmanfan> oh, not meant for me.
[10:03:32] <kinesis> if the value of textbox named "textBox1", "textBox2", or "textBox3" == '' i want to change the div called 'records' to display "0 records found."
[10:03:35] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: no, you're selecting it right.. object Object is what jQuery objects look like when you try to print them
[10:03:52] <thepacmanfan> oh, ok
[10:04:07] <thepacmanfan> so why the heck is it null when i do .clone().html()?
[10:04:29] <lacrymology> kinesis: so if the attribute "name" equals value "textBox1", you want to etcetera
[10:04:39] <lacrymology> thepacmanfan: have you tried your code in the js console?
[10:04:45] <thepacmanfan> the content of #print-container is a bunch of HTML text and elements
[10:04:52] <kinesis> no
[10:04:57] <kinesis> if the field textBox1 is empty basically
[10:05:02] <kinesis> i want div 'records' to display 0 records found
[10:05:12] <lacrymology> kinesis: let me write this
[10:05:26] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: why are you cloning first? just getting the html would suffice
[10:05:26] <kinesis> otherwise it still says 600 records found when the user presses backspace 3 times
[10:05:39] <kinesis> if the field is blank it should say 0 records
[10:05:50] <kinesis> its an onkeyup live records search
[10:06:11] <kinesis> $('div.demo-container')
[10:06:12] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, isn't that how it gets the html? heh, i'm a jquery newbie :)
[10:06:12] <kinesis>   .html('<p>All new content. <em>You bet!</em></p>');
[10:06:27] <thepacmanfan> i've worked with it some, just haven't done anything like this before
[10:06:37] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: just $("element").html() gets the html, no need to copy it first
[10:06:44] <thepacmanfan> oh, ok
[10:06:58] <lacrymology> kinesis: if( $('[name="textBox1"]').val() == '') $("#results").html('') or the like?
[10:07:24] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: i'm looking at your page source but can't seem to find your print function, where is that included?
[10:07:33] <kinesis> yeah but more like $("#records").html('0 records found.')
[10:07:46] <kinesis> but the value of name= can be dynamic
[10:07:54] <kinesis> $('[name=[name]
[10:07:54] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, sorry that is not my page. i am using their code though
[10:08:14] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, line 25 of print-sb.js:  theWork.print();
[10:08:15] <lacrymology> kinesis: then $('[name="'+variable+'"]')
[10:08:20] <kinesis> if ($('[name="[name]"').val()
[10:08:20] <kinesis> ok
[10:08:24] <kinesis> nice
[10:08:38] <lacrymology> kinesis: take a look at the manpage I sent you to
[10:08:42] <kinesis> ok
[10:08:45] <kinesis> i bookmrked it
[10:08:47] <lacrymology> there's includes
[10:08:52] <lacrymology> begins-withs
[10:08:58] <lacrymology> not-includes
[10:08:59] <thepacmanfan> by print, i meant opening the dialog to print the page in meatspace
[10:09:13] <thepacmanfan> not print onscreen :)
[10:09:44] <kinesis> if ($('[name="'+name+'"]').val() == '') $("#records").html('0 records found.')
[10:09:56] <lacrymology> how can I capture the ENTER key on a form text input so it does something else instead of submitting the form?
[10:10:35] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, jQuery('#print-container').html() is null too
[10:11:40] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: maybe i'm blind but i see no reference to print-sb.js on that page
[10:12:11] <enjoycrf> can i resize textarea
[10:12:20] <enjoycrf> like $().resizable
[10:12:23] <enjoycrf> like dragable
[10:12:49] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, ugh, my mistake.  here: http://amylinart.com/js/doit.js
[10:12:55] <thepacmanfan> function mySbOpen
[10:13:03] <fris> with bind keydown or keypress can you have it for words like "w o r d"
[10:13:04] <kborchers> just found that ... looking
[10:13:10] <thepacmanfan> i will pastebin it if you want
[10:13:42] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/mWhRKYWx
[10:13:43] <thepacmanfan> the line with <div>http://www.amylinart.com/</div> in it is where i am workin
[10:13:45] <thepacmanfan> +g
[10:13:56] <Sean-Der> For some reason my </select> is being appended before my looped out numbers
[10:14:06] <Sean-Der> Is there some way I could delay the process?
[10:15:01] <thepacmanfan> again, this is not my site, i'm just using their code... that's why i'm referencing #print-container, instead of #sb-container like they used
[10:15:19] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: well, obviously what they have done works so without seeing your code in action and not working, i can't really diagnose the issue :(
[10:15:49] <thepacmanfan> alright. it's on our dev site now, but i can move these changes to our live site. will you be here in about 30 minutes?
[10:16:13] <kborchers> i have a meeting in about 15 minutes then i should be back about 45 min from now
[10:16:30] <thepacmanfan> alright. i will move it to our live site after lunch and let you know. thanks for looking at this :)
[10:16:36] <kborchers> np
[10:16:46] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/2yYu5gUE
[10:16:55] <Sean-Der> Here is my actual HTML so show my problem too
[10:18:12] <Xeon06_> I think I found a bug in jQuery. Does anyone have time to look it over with me?
[10:18:20] <Sean-Der> Tried a delay .800 still no dice
[10:18:47] <ajpiano> Xeon06_: what is it, got a jsfiddle?
[10:18:53] <ajpiano> did you search the bug tracker?
[10:18:54] <ajpiano> etc.
[10:19:04] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Will check then come back
[10:19:18] <ajpiano> can you give me a couple word description of it, i might know off hand
[10:20:35] <fris> with keypress, can you use it for words like "n o w" so it triggers when the word is complete?
[10:22:07] <thinkt4nk> fris > you can check the $(e.target).val() to see if the word is complete
[10:22:52] <thinkt4nk> I would recommend using keyup() instead though
[10:22:57] <fris> ahh ok so nothing i can set like i would ctrl+h etc
[10:24:09] <thinkt4nk> ??
[10:24:16] <Sean-Der> Well setTimeOut and Delay don't help either
[10:24:25] <Sean-Der> I am out of ideas anyone else?
[10:24:33] <ajpiano> dude
[10:24:40] <ajpiano> Sean-Der: appending doesn't work like this dawg
[10:24:47] <ajpiano> javascript works in terms of Elements not Strings
[10:24:54] <ajpiano> you can't append an opening tag, then a bunch of tags inside, and then a closing tag
[10:25:03] <ajpiano> build the entire string of the select with the options up and then append the whole thing in one go
[10:25:04] <ajpiano> aight?
[10:25:06] <ajpiano> cool
[10:25:08] <ajpiano> i'm going back to work.
[10:25:19] <fris> thinkt4nk like $(document).bind('keypress', 'shift+u', function(e) {
[10:26:06] <fris> even though i have it set as shift+u , u just works
[10:26:12] <ajpiano> Sean-Der http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[10:26:23] <thinkt4nk> oh, well shift+u _is_ a keypress, not a series
[10:31:01] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: http://alexturpin.net/jquery.html
[10:32:21] <ajpiano> Xeon06_: http://www.eatliver.com/img/2011/7636.jpg
[10:32:23] <ajpiano> whoops
[10:32:26] <ajpiano> thanks clipboard
[10:32:31] <ajpiano> Xeon06_: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5997
[10:32:37] <ajpiano> feel free to laugh at that chart though if you want
[10:32:56] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: At first I thought that was gonna be some jerk "people who care" chart haha
[10:33:01] <ajpiano> haha
[10:33:11] <ajpiano> no that was a "i didn't press cmd-c hard enough" chart :D
[10:33:40] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Thanks for linking me to that. I'll comment there and follow it
[10:33:53] <ajpiano> it's pretty much closed... there's a bunch of dupes ... thanks for not adding to the pile
[10:34:50] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Thanks to you.
[10:34:55] <ajpiano> :)
[10:35:27] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Meaning it should be fixed in the next release or?
[10:35:39] <ajpiano> meaning it's closed patchwelcome and we don't have a workaround
[10:35:48] <ajpiano> and you can't use live change on file inputs on ie :/
[10:37:09] <Xeon06_> Well I just commented a fix
[10:37:17] <Xeon06_> Maybe someone'll see it and patch it
[10:37:19] <jimi_hendrix> i have a jquery UI question: is there a way to set the length of a slider? I want my slider to be the height of my canvs (600 px)
[10:37:59] <ajpiano> Xeon06_:  unfortunately that fix is not appropriate for jQuery core
[10:38:30] <ajpiano> but it's good that you linked it in case people need an app-specific workaround
[10:39:04] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Ahh ok.
[10:39:43] <enjoycrf> any1 kno how to wordwrap text
[10:40:29] <enjoycrf> so it comes form the textarea looking like it does in the textarea
[10:40:52] <enjoycrf> because its either a div or the textarea that will wrap the text for u
[10:41:28] <enjoycrf> but if you do $(textarea).val()
[10:41:39] <enjoycrf> its not wrapped
[10:42:12] <enjoycrf> so i have to do textwrap(text.val())
[10:42:20] <detain> what is the difference between flot and flotr ?
[10:42:21] <enjoycrf> again
[10:43:26] <enjoycrf> dam i always have quastion no1 can answer
[10:51:31] <Know1edge> Anyone remember the jquery plugin that when you hover a link or button, the entire screen will go grey (similar to lightbox effect) and it will leave the area you hovered ungreyed (or another area if you choose) to draw emphasis to the area
[10:52:21] <Know1edge> can see what i mean on "get started"  on here http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercise/0
[10:52:28] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: i have no idea how to emulate the behaviour of DOMAttrModified in Chrome/Safari when it would trigger reliably in Firefox/Others :(
[10:52:28] <Know1edge> when you click
[10:54:19] <jaequery> hula
[11:03:25] <shoelessone> hi all
[11:08:21] <ciss> hi, is there a way to get the whole collection inside an .each() callback?
[11:08:43] <svnlto> ciss: index and el is available to you
[11:08:43] <pangel> What is the best way to capture the value of an input field after a keydown? I am always off by one (ie. field is "a", then I press "v", $(this).val() is now "a", then I press "b", $(this).val() is now "av")
[11:09:44] <ciss> svnlto: i know. but this also refers to the current element, so i was hoping there might be another context/object i could access
[11:09:59] <tra> pangel: keyup might do the trick
[11:10:37] <svnlto> ciss: create an empty var before you loop and fill that up as you loop over
[11:10:45] <svnlto> ciss: if that makes sense
[11:12:17] <svnlto> ciss: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/qwfka0xngm45odj9s1ufgq
[11:13:14] <ggarri> sorry
[11:13:36] <ggarri> what mouse event simulate dragged mouse ?
[11:14:10] <ciss> svnlto: it doesn't in my case. i've bound a load handler to a couple of images before reloading them. after all images have been loaded i call a callback. it's easy to do: "var count = $('img', context).length;" - i was just curious if there might be "hidden feature" i'm not aware of
[11:14:39] <svnlto> uhum.
[11:14:40] <shoelessone> quick question: I have something like <li class="current"><input type="radio" name="one" /><input type="radio" name="one" /></li>
[11:14:55] <shoelessone> oops, and each of those input boxes haev different values
[11:15:05] <enjoycrf> is there a way to wrap the text like the textarea wraps it
[11:15:11] <shoelessone> so, value="1" and value="2", respectively
[11:15:41] <shoelessone> now, if I check one of those checkboxes, and do alert($("input:checked")); I get the value of the checked box
[11:15:44] <shoelessone> check radio button rather
[11:16:01] <shoelessone> however, if I do alert($(".current input:checked")); I get undefined
[11:16:39] <shoelessone> even though the checked/selected input box is a child of the <li class="current"> element
[11:16:57] <zoned> try .current input[name=one].is(':checked')
[11:17:00] <zoned> shoelessone^
[11:17:21] <kitikonti> is there a way to read a object wrapped in an html comment like <!-- <a href="test">test</a> -->
[11:17:31] <zoned> wait, are you trying to get the value of the checked one, or get a true/false as to whether it's checked?
[11:17:41] <shoelessone> thanks much! but the thing is, I don't want to specify a name, because there are a few <li> and I only want to get the value of the current set of radio boxes
[11:17:44] <shoelessone> if that makes sense
[11:17:56] <shoelessone> i want the value of the selected radio box
[11:18:12] <shoelessone> so, $("input:checked").val() gives the correct value
[11:18:17] <shoelessone> the desired effect
[11:18:20] <enjoycrf> u guyz gona help me or nawat
[11:18:47] <shoelessone> sorry, enjoycrf I don't totally get it, text wrapping is more of a CSS/style thing, or am I confused?
[11:19:15] <zoned> shoelessone, you know the "name" attribute is used for the GROUP of radio buttons, right? maybe i'm confused as to what you're trying to do. but it looks like you want to get the value of the checked radio from the group name "one" ?
[11:19:19] <shoelessone> but, I want to limit the scope of the selection to the <input type="radio"> inside of the current (class="current") li item
[11:19:28] <enjoycrf> hahaha exactly
[11:19:35] <enjoycrf> its kind of a leet quastion
[11:20:27] <shoelessone> http://justpaste.it/gka
[11:20:34] <shoelessone> that's an example of the markup zoned
[11:20:34] <zoned> enjoycrf, when you say it comes 'wrapped' what do you mean? with line breaks?
[11:20:51] <enjoycrf> ok the textaread wraps text
[11:20:58] <enjoycrf> divs wrap text and so on
[11:21:00] <enjoycrf> right
[11:21:02] <shoelessone> right
[11:21:21] <enjoycrf> when collect the text via .val or .html
[11:21:27] <zoned> enjoycrf, right, but that's done via styling/browser. javascript has no idea where the text got wrapped.
[11:21:28] <zoned> afaik
[11:21:30] <enjoycrf> it comes unwrapped
[11:21:40] <shoelessone> ok
[11:21:42] <enjoycrf> so  u have to wrap it w a function
[11:21:43] <Michael> Are there any performance gains in using my own register/dispatches over an internal array of objects over $.bind('event') and $.trigger('event') ?
[11:22:07] <enjoycrf> that function is wordwrap
[11:22:15] <zoned> enjoycrf, sure. may i ask what the point of this is? why don't you count the characters and write a function to wrap it yourself? what's your ultimate goal
[11:22:16] <shoelessone> you don't wrap anything with a function, you wrap it by applying some styling to it
[11:22:21] <enjoycrf> and usually takes the number of chars to start wrapping at
[11:23:16] <enjoycrf> is there a way to get the text as it is wrapped in the textarea
[11:23:21] <enjoycrf> or the div
[11:23:33] <zoned> shoelessone, so why can't you do $(.current input[name=occasion].is(':checked')).val() ... for occasion, food, and wine. then you'll get the 3 values
[11:24:52] <zoned> enjoycrf, the wrap depends on: styling, width of the text area, font size, which font it is, how the browser wants to do it.... how exactly do you expect jquery to figure that out?
[11:25:12] <enjoycrf> i know
[11:25:14] <zoned> guarantee you it wraps differently in different browsers and on different machines with different resolutions and dpi settings
[11:25:24] <zoned> so again i'll ask, why do you want to do this?
[11:25:41] <enjoycrf> tiny mce doesnt come wraped either right
[11:25:51] <enjoycrf> when u resize the textarea
[11:26:11] <zoned> you're avoidiing my question
[11:26:25] <enjoycrf> i need to wrap the text inside a box
[11:26:30] <enjoycrf> thats resizable
[11:26:44] <enjoycrf> its for a vector image
[11:26:45] <zoned> put the text in the box. give the box a width via css.
[11:26:55] <enjoycrf> so its not css
[11:27:13] <natrixnatrix89> hello. I'm looking for a function that would be the opposite of :nth selector..
[11:27:13] <natrixnatrix89> I mean if I have an element. and I want to get which rank in a list does it have.. can anyone help?
[11:27:15] <zoned> are you putting text in a div?
[11:27:27] <enjoycrf> no
[11:27:29] <shoelessone> natrixnatrix89: how about "siblins()"
[11:27:34] <shoelessone> "siblings()"
[11:27:36] <enjoycrf> the text gets passed to an image makes
[11:27:38] <enjoycrf> r
[11:28:06] <shoelessone> php or some backend "image maker", like glib?
[11:28:10] <shoelessone> or gdlib ?
[11:28:11] <b1lly> lets say I set var1 = "3"; like a string... how would i do math with it? var1 + var2 ?
[11:28:11] <natrixnatrix89> siblings? how does it help me to get the rank of the current element?
[11:28:16] <enjoycrf> cairo
[11:28:22] <shoelessone> if you can imagine, what will happen is these various li will fade in/out as you proceed through this questionare. I COULD just get all three values by specifically setting the name=occasion, name=wine, etc, however I shouldn't have to... I will be applying the "current" class to the current set of questions (so again the li that contains the "current" class)
[11:28:34] <natrixnatrix89> shoelassone? how will siblings help in this case?
[11:28:39] <shoelessone> oh, sorry, I thougt you wanted the oppositve of a specific nth element
[11:29:56] <shoelessone> so natrixnatrix89, is .index() what you're looking for?
[11:29:56] <zoned> shoelessone, $(.current input:checked') doesn't work?
[11:30:20] <zoned> b1lly, try Number(var1)
[11:30:22] <natrixnatrix89> exactly!
[11:30:23] <shoelessone> zoned: nope :(
[11:30:23] <natrixnatrix89> thanks!
[11:30:29] <shoelessone> np, natrixnatrix89
[11:30:53] <shoelessone> console.log($(".current input:checked").val());
[11:30:58] <grey> Anyone know the best way to put a "fake tab" in a jquery-ui tab interface?
[11:31:09] <zoned> b1lly, sorry, i meant if (isNaN(var1)) var1 + whatever
[11:31:32] <shoelessone> https://gist.github.com/dd9e4de928196a969604
[11:31:36] <ajpiano> b1lly: javascript will cast strings to numbers when it can, otherwise you can use parseInt, parseFloat, new Number(str), or simply put a + in front of it to try to cast it
[11:31:39] <zoned> isNaN(var1) will tell you if it is not a number. so if (!isNaN(var1)) means it is a number
[11:31:43] <zoned> b1lly
[11:32:03] <enjoycrf> sholes ur problem sounds easy
[11:32:18] <shoelessone> it does
[11:32:21] <zoned> shoelessone, that select should work. i just checked some code i had that was similar to yours, and that's exactly how i do it.
[11:32:22] <grey> I need to have a tab that's actually a button and to intercept clicks on it, if I style the button as with other actual tabs, jquery tabs intercept the clicks, if I don't I can't for the life of me get it to look right
[11:32:26] <shoelessone> it seems like something super simple isn't working
[11:32:31] <Z3R0> Anyone recommend any good (custom form loader with overlay)? I've looked into contact-pop but there's not much doc on it at all
[11:32:41] <zoned> are you sure the .current class is already applied when you're attempting to make the selection
[11:32:47] <enjoycrf> try .ready
[11:32:58] <shoelessone> grey: i would imagine jquery-ui has some sort of callback functionality though, for their tabs?
[11:33:08] <enjoycrf> u sure its picking up ur html?
[11:33:20] <ggarri> what mouse event simulate dragged mouse ?
[11:33:21] <zoned> shoelessone, console.log($('.current input:checked').length);
[11:33:33] <shoelessone> yep, 0
[11:33:34] <zoned> shoelessone, console.log($('.current input').length);
[11:33:34] <shoelessone> nothing
[11:33:48] <enjoycrf> dood
[11:33:59] <enjoycrf> $(document).html
[11:34:00] <zoned> ok, well if there are no inputs in current...
[11:34:09] <zoned> then obviously there's not a checked one
[11:34:24] <shoelessone> https://gist.github.com/348e90821e1080bcceb4
[11:34:26] <zoned> console.log($('.current').html());
[11:34:30] <shoelessone> that's ALL of my JS
[11:34:50] <enjoycrf> put ur js at the bottom
[11:34:53] <shoelessone> i've tried all of those things1 .current returns the correct html (all of the <input> radio buttons)
[11:35:11] <shoelessone> i can put it at the bottom, but it isn't running until the DOM is ready so I can't imagine this would be the issue
[11:35:16] <shoelessone> I'm sure it's something really small/simple
[11:35:17] <zoned> shoelessone, make a jsfiddle
[11:35:24] <shoelessone> jsfiddle?
[11:35:30] <shoelessone> oh
[11:35:32] <shoelessone> ok
[11:35:32] <zoned> ?jsfillde @shoelessone
[11:35:34] <zoned> oh
[11:35:40] <zoned> i forget
[11:35:47] <ajpiano> i'm making one
[11:35:47] <ajpiano> btw
[11:35:51] <zoned> i'm dislexic
[11:35:56] <zoned> dyslexic? lol.
[11:36:07] <enjoycrf> install firebug
[11:36:25] <Z3R0> anyone?
[11:36:38] <enjoycrf> anyways i made a hack
[11:36:49] <zoned> z3r0, custom form loader?
[11:36:52] <enjoycrf> that will get the box width
[11:37:02] <enjoycrf> then divide that by font size
[11:37:11] <zoned> enjoycrf, unless the font is monospaced...
[11:37:14] <zoned> not gonna work
[11:37:16] <enjoycrf> and that gives u the wrap
[11:37:29] <enjoycrf> its close and it works
[11:37:40] <b1lly> if i do var1 = "1"; var2= "2" and then do var1 + var2               ; it returns 12
[11:37:48] <b1lly> how do i make it recognize them as variables and not strings
[11:37:49] <enjoycrf> and im saving 2 vars now text and wrap
[11:37:49] <zoned> var1 = 1;
[11:37:56] <b1lly> what if its already a string
[11:38:02] <Z3R0> something that will let me load my own form.php or other_form.php
[11:38:04] <zoned> b1lly, var1 = 1;
[11:38:05] <enjoycrf> so it keeps the original when u widen the box
[11:38:06] <Z3R0> but overlays easily
[11:38:06] <zoned> not "1"
[11:38:15] <b1lly> zoned: i know, what if it's already seen as a string
[11:38:18] <b1lly> how to convert it
[11:38:33] <enjoycrf> anyways think about by issue ill go work on styling
[11:38:49] <zoned> b1lly, parseInt(var1)
[11:39:40] <zoned> but i would first do if (!isNaN(var1)) var1 = parseInt(var1);
[11:39:58] <zoned> err, without the !
[11:40:05] <chaoflow> I'm having issues with chrome and mouseup. It starts dragging, stops dragging and enters a mode that looks like "drag n drop of the whole page eg to the desktop", the mouseup event then does not reach the document
[11:40:15] <Z3R0> basically I like the style of say 'blockUI' but with a custom form that I can process from
[11:40:33] <zoned> chaoflow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6978739/why-jquery-mouseup-event-is-not-working-in-google-chrome
[11:40:57] <shoelessone> very frustering, no problems in jsfiddle
[11:41:05] <Z3R0> hmmm... wonder if I can just use blockUI lol
[11:41:09] <ajpiano> shoelessone: http://jsfiddle.net/PS4m3/
[11:41:11] <shoelessone> i mean, i've written enough jquery i know this SHOULD work
[11:41:28] <b1lly> zoned:  parseInt works, however, if the number is 522.15 ... it returns 522
[11:41:34] <ajpiano> ah ok :)
[11:41:35] <zoned> b1lly, parseFloat
[11:41:40] <chaoflow> zoned: thx!
[11:42:57] <zoned> shoelessone, if it works in jsfiddle, then it's gotta be something else in your document. just start ripping stuff out until it fixes itself?
[11:43:46] <b1lly> zoned: what if i wanted to int to only go 2 decimal places over?
[11:44:30] <ggarri> hi
[11:44:46] <ggarri> how can I remove a event from a element ?
[11:44:50] <zoned> b1lly, then you need a function after the parseFloat to round it or do whatever you want
[11:45:04] <zoned> there should be plenty of documentation online or jquery libraries to help you do whatever you want to do
[11:45:10] <ggarri> I mean, I want to delete a event previous declared
[11:45:52] <ravenzz> unbind?
[11:46:08] <chaoflow> zoned: its not in combination with scroll - the problem only occurs if text in chrome is marked - probably I need a way to suppress selection of text in that case
[11:46:44] <zoned> chaoflow: that's an odd and very specific issue.. never heard of it before :/ back to google!
[11:47:35] <test_blue> hi
[11:47:50] <test_blue> has anyone ever worked with the jquery ui plugin "selectmenu"?
[11:48:04] <test_blue> for the life of me I can't figure out how to get it to "return false;"
[11:48:06] <aro> is there a library available to auto create forms based on the users country? ie: selecting USA gives a list of states etc
[11:48:32] <zoned> aro, i assume you searched google before asking here?
[11:48:55] <aro> yes
[11:49:07] <aro> i dont know if i need a webservice or something
[11:49:15] <StPiere> i have div's with in the form <div id="div1>value1</div><div id="div2">value2</div>..etc. and want to make form with input fields filled with value1, value2, ..etc. whats the best way??
[11:50:13] <zoned> aro, you've got to find a database or a list somewhere of all the countries/states. whether you make this yourself or find it online
[11:50:21] <aro> ok
[11:50:40] <test_blue> aro: try this, http://www.script-tutorials.com/creating-ajaxy-chained-selects-with-jquery/
[11:50:47] <zoned> aro, then you need to decide if you're going to incorporate this hard coded into the javascript, or use ajax/php ?
[11:51:12] <keystr0k> How can I make the last part of this dynamic/variable-driven?   swfobject.getObjectById("swfobject-1").playDropdown();
[11:51:20] <keystr0k> where playDropdown() is the value of a variable.
[11:51:21] <keystr0k> ?
[11:51:31] <keystr0k> (not jquery-specific, sorry)
[11:51:33] <test_blue> lookup window[]
[11:51:43] <Z3R0> ah perfect ok, blockUI can do exactly what I want lol
[11:51:49] <test_blue> it allows you to create variable variables
[11:51:52] <keystr0k> test_blue:  thanks, will that work in this case/ I am seeing some docs about thatâ€¦ thanks!
[11:52:02] <Z3R0> anyone know if there's an easy way in BlockUI to call a form without it first being loaded into a div (and then hidden)
[11:52:31] <test_blue> keystr0k: not sure, it's written on my whiteboard but i haven't used it...
[11:52:32] <zoned> can someone give me a selector that will select all id's that BEGIN WITH a certain string?
[11:52:54] <test_blue> zoned: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:53:00] <keystr0k> test_blue: heheâ€¦ I guess the problem is that playDropdown() is a function that belongs to the swfobject. I'll look into it :D thanks
[11:53:27] <zoned> test_blue, haha i had no idea you could do ^= .. thanks
[11:54:40] <bakers> Help me wrap my mind around converting a function to non-asynchronous? I have a mock up http://jsfiddle.net/kMNjd/
[11:58:38] <aro> ill probably use ajax/php so we dont have excessive page sizes
[11:59:53] <ajpiano> bakers http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/cps/
[12:01:18] <Z3R0> Anyone know if there's anything like blockUI that can load a form into the overlay via a dynamic name (without having to preload the form and hide it) ?
[12:01:46] <zoned> i have 10 divs, #menu0, #menu1, ... #menu9. when i click, for example, #menu6, i would like to call the function jumpTo(6).... i tried coding this through a loop (for i < 10) $('#menu' + i).click(function(e) {jump(i);}); but it doesn't work. can anyone give me a better way to accomplish this?
[12:03:00] <ajpiano> zoned: you should give them all a class, bind one click handler
[12:03:08] <ajpiano> and parse the number out of hte id string
[12:03:13] <cups> hey guys, I have a weird problem with an image swap effect, I'm fading in and out between two swapping images every ten seconds..   if I switch to another site tab on the browser, wait a while, and then switch back to the tab with my site, the animation happens over and over again very quickly.  It seems to make up for the time that it wasn't displaying on screen, and then goes back to the normal ten second intervals... anyone deal with s
[12:03:15] <Z3R0> <div class=".menu" data-id='#'>Menu</div> $('.menu').click(function() { jumpTo($(this).data('id')); } ???
[12:03:32] <ajpiano> Z3R0: class="menu"
[12:03:39] <ajpiano> but yes, that is a muuch better solution
[12:03:40] <Z3R0> ah mt sorry
[12:03:48] <Z3R0> I just learned that yesterday and LOVE IT
[12:03:53] <ajpiano> YAY
[12:03:58] <ajpiano> that's what i'm talking about
[12:04:03] <ajpiano> learning things and applying them
[12:04:05] <ajpiano> WOOO
[12:04:08] <Z3R0> Now to My Problem: Anyone know if there's anything like blockUI that can load a form into the overlay via a dynamic name (without having to preload the form and hide it) ?
[12:04:16] <ajpiano> uh
[12:04:27] <cups> is there maybe a way to call the stop function when I switch browser tabs?
[12:04:30] <ajpiano> there are probably modal dialogs that use ajax
[12:04:38] <ajpiano> and automatigically load something in
[12:04:47] <ajpiano> but i don't really think that's good
[12:05:06] <Z3R0> it's for a custom lan site only for my company not out in production
[12:05:38] <amh345> afternoon all.  i found a glitch in my app im wondering if anyone can help with.  when a user comes to by page via a referrer i track that referrer in the db.   however when the user enters the form and errors out i lose the referrer in the url.  is there any way to take that referrer back on?
[12:05:49] <ajpiano> Z3R0: that isn't really a relevant detail to tis conversation
[12:06:07] <Z3R0> why would you not do that?
[12:06:31] <ajpiano> Z3R0: because showing a modal dialog is an atomic task, as is loading html
[12:06:41] <Z3R0> atomic ?
[12:06:43] <ajpiano> you shouldn't really munge them all together in one interface
[12:06:48] <ajpiano> it's a single, distinct job
[12:07:13] <ajpiano> you should just be able to load the markup for the form and pass that directly to blockui
[12:07:19] <ajpiano> without inserting it and then having to hide it
[12:07:32] <zoned> ajpiano: that's a good idea. do you know why my solution doesn't work?
[12:07:33] <Z3R0> well that's the thing that's what I am trying to find
[12:07:44] <zoned> just out of curiousity
[12:07:47] <ajpiano> zoned: yes, it doesn't work because of how iterator variables persist in javascript
[12:07:58] <ajpiano> let me get you the link, no botty :(
[12:08:06] <Z3R0> blockUi requires you have the div already created and hide it... (and then call message = $(#myDiv) )
[12:08:34] <Z3R0> which I don't want to do
[12:08:50] <Z3R0> I'd rather simply add my url to my form and let it parse
[12:09:17] <ajpiano> Z3R0 $.blockUI( {message: $( myHTMLString) }); should work just fine
[12:09:19] <cups> Hey guys, can anyone help, I'm fading in and out between two swapping images every ten seconds..   if I switch to another site tab on the browser, wait a while, and then switch back to the tab with my site, the animation happens over and over again rapidly.  It seems to make up for the time that it wasn't displaying on screen, and then goes back to the normal ten second intervals... anyone have nay idwas?
[12:09:29] <Z3R0> o.o it should ?
[12:09:34] <Z3R0> brb testing
[12:09:39] <KyouJin-SaMa> http://pastebin.com/JHtkviGi
[12:09:39] <cups> *any ideas
[12:09:58] <ajpiano> zoned: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically
[12:10:10] <KyouJin-SaMa> I'm very much a noob, trying to use some json i'm returning locally
[12:10:28] <KyouJin-SaMa> been having a hard time really..
[12:10:30] <ajpiano> cups, it's a known bug
[12:10:53] <ajpiano> cups: http://jqbug.com/9381
[12:10:56] <KyouJin-SaMa> can anyone tell me what is it i'm doing wrong? i can't get te value to sho up unfortunatly
[12:11:09] <ajpiano> it's marked fixed but that's for the next version of jquery that's bout to be released
[12:11:48] <Z3R0> ajpiano, I'm confused how is $('html_code') going to load a custom form ?
[12:12:02] <test_blue> has anyone ever used the jquery ui selectmenu plugin?
[12:12:02] <ajpiano> Z3R0: jquery consturcts dom structure on the fly from an html string
[12:12:02] <Z3R0> wouldn't that require it to be preloaded already and hidden (not viewed)
[12:12:21] <cups> aj, cool thanks.
[12:12:21] <ajpiano> an element you construct dynamically in that fashion will be identical to first loading the form, sticking it in the dom, and then selecting that element
[12:12:23] <Z3R0> ah....
[12:12:37] <svnlto> ajpiano: im trying to get a hold of something like http://dojofoundation.org/images/dojoMobileRoadmap.png for jquery. i know there used to be a spreadsheet showing a roadmap or something.
[12:12:43] <Z3R0> so actually parse my form into  the message directly
[12:12:55] <Z3R0> there's no way of calling it form a url though and loading the info ?
[12:13:05] <bstakes> KyouJin - $.(#results).text(json.integer); you don't need the .
[12:13:17] <ajpiano> svnlto: um, there's the thing on trac but it's a little hit and miss
[12:13:21] <ajpiano> and it definitely ain't as fancy as that
[12:13:50] <KyouJin-SaMa> bstakes, so just $.(#results).text(integer); ?
[12:14:30] <bstakes> $('#results').text(json.integer);
[12:15:12] <svnlto> ajpiano: hmk
[12:15:18] <Z3R0> ajpiano,hoping for something similar to message = $.load('my_form.php'); // although I know that won't work
[12:16:04] <Z3R0> because I'm using a class based link that ties to several different pages and just simply varies on the form loading based on where you're at in the site
[12:16:07] <ajpiano> Z3R0: why are you hoping for that API
[12:16:23] <ajpiano> Z3R0: you could write a simple wrapper for your own app
[12:16:31] <ajpiano> that loads the url dynamically and passes it to block ui
[12:16:42] <ajpiano> or loads a preexisting div
[12:16:53] <Z3R0> hmmmm....
[12:17:05] <ajpiano> i think that's a much less painful solution than replacing your modal impl
[12:17:07] <Z3R0> ok I think I got an idea now thanks
[12:17:11] <ajpiano> sweet
[12:18:31] <djQuery> ?ftjq@geekbuntu

[12:20:54] <Z3R0> nvm I think I have an even better idea now
[12:21:47] <infinite-scale> I'm trying to make a post request from a form with one upload field and 3 other json encoded data. is that possible to send via jquery?
[12:22:11] <topriddy> hello
[12:22:16] <Z3R0> HA perfect!
[12:22:26] <enjoycrf> lol?
[12:22:29] <topriddy> please how do i change the value of an html input tag with an id foo
[12:22:42] <ajpiano> $("#foo").val("bar")
[12:22:43] <jmar777> topriddy: $('#foo').val('new value')
[12:22:47] <Z3R0> $('#foo).val("stuff");
[12:22:50] <ajpiano> that's your one freebie, you have to go read the docs
[12:22:51] <topriddy> secondly how do i call a form with id bar and make it submit?
[12:22:52] <Z3R0> missed a '
[12:23:00] <zoned> when should you decide to use delegate vs bind vs live vs just (for example) .click() ?
[12:23:08] <enjoycrf> i missed a LOL
[12:23:12] <topriddy> it doesent seem to work for me
[12:23:18] <zoned> how*
[12:23:24] <jmar777> delegate > live, always
[12:23:29] <jmar777> #me is biased
[12:23:42] * jmar777 made a typo
[12:24:09] <zoned> okay, and when would you use delegate vs just simply $('#div).click() ?
[12:24:10] <sadmicrowave> guys, I need help centering an image inside a container with overflow:auto after enlarging the image width and height. http://jsfiddle.net/RCw4T/1/
[12:24:11] <topriddy> single of double quotes?
[12:24:17] <jmar777> zoned: ok really. live and delegate are useful when there's a lot of dom manip going on, such as adding new elements that you want to bind events to
[12:24:29] <infinite-scale> anyone familiar with file upload?
[12:24:43] <infinite-scale> I would need to submit some other variables is that possible?
[12:25:16] <jmar777> zoned: they keep you from having to keep track of newly added dom nodes and attaching their event handlers.  if you know that you won't be adding new instances of the elements you want event handlers for, then .bind works fine
[12:25:17] <infinite-scale> so making a post request with file upload and json sending or something like that.
[12:25:49] <zoned> jmar777, .click works then too..... if you use delegate for some stuff, and end up adding a lot of OTHER stuff to the dom, does that addition of the other stuff slow down because it has to determine if it should be delegated an event?
[12:26:24] <zoned> basically, i can create the stuff, bind a .click after creating it, or i can just set up a delegate in the very beginning. which is better?
[12:26:27] <topriddy> jmar777: thanks. but lastly how do i get a form with id bar and then call submit?
[12:26:43] <topriddy> between i do this from within a facebox, maybe that is the problem ??
[12:26:46] <zoned> there is a lot of dom manip in this page
[12:27:14] <danzik17> zoned: I'd lean towards a delegate then.  It really simplifies later manipulation then if you don't need to worry about event binding
[12:27:58] <topriddy> how would i get a form and then submit its value?
[12:28:03] <zoned> danzik17, i actually wrote this page before i knew delegate existed. so now i'm trying to determine if it would be worth it to go back and use delegate instead of binding event handlers on the fly as i create stuff. i'm mostly concerned with performance.
[12:28:33] <jmar777> topriddy: $('#bar').submit()
[12:29:09] <sadmicrowave> any takers? the underlying idea is that when the user centers a section of the image inside the container and clicks zoom, the image enlarges but still remains centered on that section
[12:29:29] <danzik17> zoned: In theory, delegate could be worth it then depending on how many DOM elements are being manip (how many events are being bound, unbound, etc..).  That said, there's also slight overhead since bubbling needs to occur before the event is handled.
[12:29:50] <sadmicrowave> that way you can continue zooming on a section without having to hunt for the section after every click
[12:29:54] <danzik17> zoned: I find the huge benefit just to be simplifying my codebase, not necessarily performance related.
[12:30:14] <zoned> danzik17: that's the answer i was looking for, thanks.
[12:30:28] <dlam> hmm i have a snippet like this:  <a href="javascript:MyStuff.foo(this)">click me</a>       ...is there a way to get the <a> anchor that was clicked in function foo() without passing 'this'  ?
[12:31:21] <jmar777> dlam: ewww... why not $('a').click(function() { /* `this` is the anchor */ });
[12:32:16] <dlam> ohh yeah that would do it -_-
[12:32:40] <WarDekar> so i just started using jEditable, and i have a table with 2 columns, the right column is editable... when I make a change to the text and click out of it, it then shifts the text of the entire row down for some reason and i'm not really sure why
[12:33:41] <topriddy> does calling stuff from a facebox stop things from working? :(
[12:33:48] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, still around?
[12:33:56] <kborchers> yep
[12:39:20] <thefalling> lets say i have 2 functions that handle a single hover event, how would i make it so one gets executed before the other one?
[12:40:44] <thefalling> One of the functions is in a jquery plugin i have, and i dont want to edit that code
[12:44:19] <thepacmanfan> sorry for the PM, i just prefer that not EVERYONE gawk at dev work on a live site ;)
[12:44:25] <Sengoku> http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/ext-4.0.0/examples/writer/writer.html
[12:44:30] <Sengoku> Anyone know of a plugin similar to the above
[12:44:34] <Sengoku> MIT/Apache licensed though
[12:44:35] <Brodingo> i be gawkin
[12:44:48] <thepacmanfan> the big red "Our United States Distributors" button is what triggers shadowbox
[12:45:20] <thepacmanfan> in this case you're looking for print-sb.js
[12:45:46] <thepacmanfan> and you can see the problem when you click the little printer icon
[12:46:33] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: looking
[12:46:41] <thepacmanfan> thanks again :)
[12:48:52] <pozzo> Hi
[12:49:56] <pozzo> Does anybody use the flot graphic library with jquery ?
[12:51:08] <sadmicrowave> still need help centering an image in an overflow:auto container: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7196333/jquery-center-image-after-zooming-in-overflowauto-container
[12:54:41] <thefalling> lets say i have 2 functions that handle a single hover event, how would i make it so one gets executed before the other one?
[12:54:45] <thefalling> One of the functions is in a jquery plugin i have, and i dont want to edit that code
[12:55:08] <zoned> i need to write a function that will parse out the numbers from a string.. the number(s) i want are always going to be the last characters in the string. so sometimes it might be str1ng30 (i want 30), sometimes it may be string3 (i want 3)..
[12:55:43] <erichynds> thefalling: bind it before the plugin does
[12:56:18] <thefalling> ok ill try that
[12:56:38] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: why are you using an iframe for that content?
[13:00:54] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: ?
[13:02:04] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, sorry bout that, i'm here again
[13:02:06] <zoned> can someone tell me what's wrong with this line? it keeps saying unexpected ';'
[13:02:06] <zoned> (!isNaN(id.charAt(i))) ? num += id.charAt(i)+'' : break;
[13:02:47] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: did you see my question? why you using an iframe for that printable content?
[13:02:57] <thepacmanfan> i'm looking to see where it is...
[13:04:31] <danzik17> zoned: break is a reserved word I believe?
[13:04:39] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, not any reason in particular. is that breaking jquery's ability to "get" the html?
[13:04:41] <zoned> danzik17, it is in a loop
[13:04:46] <zoned> i want to break
[13:05:22] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: yes, your selector won't look in the contents of that iframe. just change it to a div with overflow: auto if you want it to scroll and i think that will solve it
[13:06:22] <danzik17> zoned: I'd use an if/else for that tbh, ternary for choosing an action is just weird at least to me
[13:06:40] <cob> hi, is it possible to do an alpha transformation on a block element to cover part of an animation? I'd like to animate a div make it seem its coming out of an invisible envelope.
[13:07:13] <zoned> danzik17: i've replaced it with that already, but still trying to figure out why there's anything wrong with that ? lol
[13:07:54] <thepacmanfan> kborchers, are you familiar with Shadowbox?
[13:08:01] <guy> how to detect if DIV elements content has changed? I've tried .change() though it wasn't triggered.
[13:08:17] <kborchers> not really, but that shouldn't matter. why?
[13:08:41] <MoTiOnXml> yeye
[13:09:35] <cob> I think I'll probably have to chop up the images and play with z-index.
[13:09:53] <thepacmanfan> just curious about how it handles iframes. i wasn't using one intentionally.
[13:09:53] <thefalling> erichynds: I tried binding the first function which does a load, but it still doesnt wait till after the load to call the function inside my query plugin
[13:09:58] <thepacmanfan> i'm digging into it now...
[13:10:08] <ljones> Is anyone here familiar with iscroll?
[13:10:39] <fris> should the bind keypress function work on a mobile device?
[13:11:08] <thefalling> or wait is .bind("mouseover", function()... the same as using .hover(function()...?
[13:11:48] <thefalling> im technically binding the one i want first, but it just doesnt wait untill the .load function finishes
[13:14:14] <danzik17> zoned: I'm not sure using break in ternary works - simple test case http://jsfiddle.net/8BCKU/
[13:14:37] <Sengoku> --------------------------------------
[13:14:39] <Astus> How can I change the background color of an SVG object with jQuery?
[13:19:59] <bakers> ajpiano: I'm not sure how that links relates to making something non-async...
[13:20:20] <ajpiano> wait.... you want to make it SYNCHRONOUS?
[13:20:22] <bakers> ajpiano: He does settimeout with his c() but that function isn't defined anywhere.
[13:20:48] <bakers> ajpiano: No the opposite. I have a function that does some stuff that is async, but I want it to wait till it's done before returning
[13:21:02] <bakers> ajpiano: I came up with this mockup (revised) http://jsfiddle.net/kMNjd/2/
[13:21:29] <bakers> that method totally works, BUT that while loop maxes the CPU
[13:21:35] <ajpiano> that's not how javascript works
[13:21:44] <ajpiano> that's why i sent you an aritcle on continuation passing
[13:22:35] <ajpiano> you can't make a function "wait"
[13:22:41] <bakers> ajpiano: In that example is c() the continuation?
[13:22:50] <ajpiano> i spose
[13:23:06] <tbranyen> function wait() { for(var i = 0; i< 1000000; i++) { } return "lol why did i do this?"; }
[13:23:29] <ajpiano> bakers: this is the article i wanted to send you actually http://nathansjslessons.appspot.com/lesson?id=1090
[13:23:51] <bakers> ajpiano: Let me check it out
[13:24:32] <gxgx> Hi everyone! I was hoping someone would be able to help me with something I belive is very basic: I just dont know what to put on line 72 and 73 to make "weekday sorting" possible. Here is the code: http://piratepad.net/4zagYxH7HW --- here is the site: http://proxytic.info/DataTable/
[13:24:49] <ajpiano> gxgx:  hey :)
[13:24:56] <gxgx> weekdays sorting is a plugin for jQuery datatables --> http://www.datatables.net/plug-ins/sorting
[13:25:01] <gxgx> hey ajpiano :D
[13:25:01] <ajpiano> btw i didn't get to mention before... i don't have any experience with datatables :/
[13:25:26] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:25:29] <gxgx> np :)
[13:26:37] <sphinxxx> how can i convert a string like "10px" to just number 10
[13:26:49] <kborchers> parseInt @ sphinxxx
[13:27:20] <sadmicrowave> ?eval parseInt("10px");
[13:27:28] <sadmicrowave> oops
[13:27:55] <sadmicrowave> .seen bot-t
[13:27:56] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 6 hours, 7 minutes and 14 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[13:28:00] <sadmicrowave> :(
[13:28:41] <discountrobot> hey guys, is there anyway i can see the submit datastring?
[13:29:33] <discountrobot> of a POST form
[13:33:50] <bakers> ajpiano: I get the idea of continuations, I just don't understand how passing a continuation can similuate make my function act like wait()
[13:33:55] <danheberden> discountrobot you can see the request headers and response in firebug or chrome dev tools
[13:35:19] <StPiere> how can i add two subforms to the group and then surroung it by an div tag , like $this->addDisplayGroup(array($subform1, $subform2), 'group-name', array('decorators' => array('FormElements', array('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'div')))))
[13:36:07] <chippy> http://rawksteady.com/wip/ http://rawksteady.com/wip/css/styles0001.css - I'm trying to remove the webbbrowser scrolling to each element when I klick something in the list
[13:36:10] <chippy> any hints/tips?
[13:37:47] <ajpiano> bakers: it can't
[13:37:48] <ajpiano> because
[13:37:51] <ajpiano> you aren't supposed to do that
[13:38:01] <ajpiano> you don't "make a function wait to return until an asynchronous function has completed"
[13:38:06] <ajpiano> because it can't be done
[13:38:32] <_|Nix|_> Hi! I have canvas = $("<canvas width='288' height='256'>Colour picker canvas</canvas>"); ... Now, how would I go about calling getContext() so I can actually draw something?
[13:38:43] <_numbers> anyone know of a minimalist alternative to jsmvc? perhaps backbone.js? i'm turned off by how much junk is in there i don't need but clients have to download.
[13:39:02] <_|Nix|_> I've tried things like canvas.element().getContext(), but no joy ...
[13:40:22] <Ricoshady> inside a click function $('#id').click(function() { });  when I console.log(this) it looks like a special format, basically a real HTML element, how do I create something similar?
[13:40:31] <Ricoshady> $('#id') returns a real object
[13:40:42] <bakers> ajpiano: So logically it looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/kMNjd/4/ ... Basic callback function stuff? What should that cb() look like to make my each loop work?
[13:41:00] <Ricoshady> i need what ever that this variable is formattet as... so $(myvariable) would work the same as $(this)
[13:41:02] <bakers> Ricoshady: $("#id") returns a jquery object
[13:41:02] <danheberden> _|Nix|_ use .get() to get the element you want
[13:41:14] <Ricoshady> yea, I know it does bakers
[13:41:14] <danheberden> _|Nix|_ like canvas.get(0)
[13:41:27] <johnwarren> What's the simplest library to make JQuery play an mp3 or ogg sound file? Not with a Flash GUI player, but just to make a sound heard?
[13:41:29] <Ricoshady> this isn't a jquery object, what is it?
[13:41:39] <Ricoshady> I need so create something like the this variable
[13:41:45] <bakers> Ricoshady: it's a dom element
[13:41:55] <ajpiano> launch_async gives you a method to actually pass a callback that it will execute when complete, bakers  ?
[13:41:56] <bakers> Ricoshady: this = dom element, $(this) makes it a jquery object
[13:41:56] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: I get undefined ... weird ... how can that be? I just defined it ...
[13:42:17] <bakers> ajpiano: Yes it will
[13:42:24] <ajpiano> right ok
[13:43:06] <danheberden> _|Nix|_ what is undefined?
[13:43:20] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: canvas.get(0) returns undefined.
[13:43:35] <ajpiano> bakers: i'm not really sure what you're asking
[13:43:36] <danheberden> what does canvas return?
[13:43:41] <danheberden> _|Nix|_ ^
[13:43:43] <ajpiano> the callback would have the logic that you want done when it's done
[13:43:52] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: Object [ object ] or something like that.
[13:44:05] <ajpiano> bakers: and you can use Function.prototype.call/apply or jQuery.proxy to manipulate the scope of the function when it is eventually fired
[13:44:09] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: [ object Object ]
[13:44:17] <danheberden> _|Nix|_ console.log gives you [ object Object ] ?
[13:44:23] <danheberden> cuz i'm sure you're not using alert
[13:44:25] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: For canvas, yes.
[13:44:26] <danheberden> no one would use alert
[13:44:55] <danheberden> how 'bout you make a demo on jsfiddle.net, _|Nix|_
[13:45:16] <ravenzz> what about canavas[0].getContext(); ?
[13:45:31] <ravenzz> canvas
[13:45:37] <bakers> ajpiano: I want to .each() across elements and call an async job on each of the, but I want to work in FIFO manner, not synchronously
[13:45:49] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: Ummm ... not sure I can *scratch head* ... this is for work, and, well ...
[13:45:52] <bakers> i.e. do the first one, wait till it's done, do the second
[13:45:57] <ajpiano> ahhh
[13:46:04] <ajpiano> i see what you're saying
[13:46:27] <ajpiano> bakers: paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[13:46:43] <ajpiano> you start the first one only, and make it's callback be firing the next one, and so on and so forth :)
[13:46:49] <Rinthe> how do i add a loading icon for a lightbox type of image viewer
[13:53:12] <chippy> anyone got a theory on what i should do with my previously mentioned problem?
[13:54:04] <dcarper> jqtouch vs jqmobile? thoughts?
[13:54:20] <enjoycrf> dont u guys think odd sized fonts look better
[14:02:49] <Dave-Stein> hey i just upgraded from jquery 1.4 to 1.6.2 along with upgrading ui from 1.8.2 to 1.8.14 on one of my sites. was there anytime where triggering 'disable' on a UI widget would automatically called .disable() from widget.js?
[14:03:36] <Dave-Stein> im looking im widget.js from older versions and dont' see it automatically calling anywhere but my plugin that extends widget is broken, and the only thing it does is trigger
[14:03:45] <Dave-Stein> and this.widgetBaseClass+'disabled' never gets added
[14:05:07] <jimi_hendrix> i have a jquery UI question: is there a way to set the length of a slider? I want my slider to be the height of my canvas (600 px)? (i asked this a bit earlier, but I didn't get an answer). i apologize if this is the wrong channel for jquery ui
[14:05:37] <Dave-Stein> i think you can do that with CSS alone
[14:07:58] <foo> anyone know of a way to do mimic scratch and win? eg. scratch an image with a mouse by clicking down, slowly remove image?
[14:08:42] <Dave-Stein> overlay a grid with a background color and set it to background transparent as user is mouseover and mouse is down
[14:09:34] <foo> Dave-Stein: thanks! I'm looking for a tutorial or something, but will attempt to run with that if needed. appreciate it :)
[14:10:26] <thefalling> Im trying to get a tooltip to show a box of data everytime the user hovers over a specific column, and when the hover occurs, a jquery .load should take place, and then the easytooltip should fire its hover function. But its not working right, it seems like its pulling the previous shipInfoDiv, like its showing the div before it finishes the load. Code is here: http://pastebin.com/unnCNSwq
[14:10:50] <Dave-Stein> well you can do $('#foo td').live( 'mouseover', function( e ) { if ( mousedown ) // defined elsewhere { $(this).css( 'background', 'transparent' ) }  } );
[14:10:54] <Dave-Stein> not too much need for a tutorial :)
[14:11:01] <jimi_hendrix> Dave-Stein, do i just alter the size of the div i am using with css?
[14:11:18] <Dave-Stein> yeah as far as i know my sliders always went 100% of size of div automatically
[14:11:24] <Dave-Stein> im fairly certain but not 100%
[14:11:45] <kborchers> jimi_hendrix: are you using a vertical slider?
[14:11:52] <jimi_hendrix> kborchers, i am
[14:12:15] <kborchers> then yes, set the div height to 600px in the css and that should do it
[14:12:32] <kborchers> the div being your slider div
[14:12:35] <jimi_hendrix> right ok
[14:12:46] <Dave-Stein> and if you're worried about dynamic height for when user changes viewpower just bind to windiow resize with a throttler
[14:13:33] <jimi_hendrix> it works perfectly, thanks guys
[14:14:06] <Dave-Stein> jimi do you have any idea about this?
[14:14:07] <Dave-Stein> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/did-ui-widget-ever-automatically-called-disable-enable
[14:15:01] <Dave-Stein> er sorry
[14:15:07] <Dave-Stein> i meant to ask kborchers ;)
[14:15:09] <jimi_hendrix> xD
[14:15:19] <ajpiano> Dave-Stein: there's a fork of selectmenu that works on the widget factory in 1.8
[14:15:28] <jimi_hendrix> this is my first time using jquery UI so i wont beof any help Dave-Stein
[14:15:31] <thepacmanfan> kborchers: changing from an iframe to a div did nothing... it still reads "null" :(
[14:15:39] <Dave-Stein> thanks aj
[14:16:16] <ajpiano> Dave-Stein https://github.com/tauren/jquery-ui/blob/selectmenu/ui/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js
[14:16:23] <ajpiano> i think that should work
[14:16:30] <Dave-Stein> sweet thanks!
[14:16:46] <foo> Dave-Stein: awesome, will play with that :) thanks a ton!
[14:17:28] <kborchers> thepacmanfan: hmmm, not sure then. have to finish some work before the end of the day too so can't really dig back in. sorry
[14:17:38] <thepacmanfan> alrighty. thanks for your time :)
[14:19:01] <Dave-Stein> hey pac what was your question that he suggested an iframe?
[14:19:21] <thepacmanfan> he suggested that my iframe may be causing the problem ;)
[14:19:35] <Dave-Stein> i dont know what your problem is
[14:19:43] <Dave-Stein> what is it? maybe i can help while im here
[14:19:47] <thepacmanfan> i am trying to get content in Shadowbox to print.
[14:19:58] <Dave-Stein> oh i dunno what shadowbox is sorry
[14:20:00] <thepacmanfan> i am using this code here: http://shadowbox-js.com/forum.html#nabble-td4783762
[14:20:13] <thepacmanfan> a demo of it is here: http://www.amylinart.com/Kinetics/Kinetics_port.htm
[14:20:25] <thepacmanfan> click any one of the images there, and it brings it up in a modal box.
[14:20:45] <thepacmanfan> well, the contents don't print when you use the browser's print dialog.
[14:20:54] <thepacmanfan> so i'm trying to work around that.
[14:21:02] <thepacmanfan> that's what that code does, basically
[14:21:07] <thepacmanfan> but it's not working for me.
[14:21:52] <thepacmanfan> my particular problem is that $("#myelement").html() or ("#myelement").clone().html() returns "null"
[14:22:01] <Dave-Stein> i clicked the print icon and it took me to a new tab and asked to print
[14:22:12] <thepacmanfan> yup
[14:22:35] <thepacmanfan> which is how it should work
[14:22:46] <thepacmanfan> http://engraveacrete.com/distributors
[14:23:14] <thepacmanfan> now this is where my problem is. click the button for the US distributors, and try and print that, and it returns null
[14:23:39] <Dave-Stein> ah
[14:24:31] <Dave-Stein> and you took away the iframe or am i missing that?
[14:24:44] <bakers> ajpiano: Reading that page you sent I get it now. One last question
[14:24:59] <bakers> ajpiano: How does JS evaluate this jq=jq.slice(1)).length
[14:25:08] <thepacmanfan> yes, i took away the iframe
[14:25:09] <bakers> does jq = jq.slice(1)
[14:25:22] <bakers> or jq = jq.slice(1).length
[14:25:38] <bakers> one is an jquery element, the other is an integer
[14:25:43] <bakers> I'm assuming it's the former?
[14:25:47] <thepacmanfan> my example was using an iframe, where the demo with the images wasn't in an iframe.
[14:26:01] <thepacmanfan> we thought that may have been causing my problem, but it appears not.
[14:26:03] <ajpiano> yeah i think it does the whole assignment and then evaluates if it's lenght is truth, iirc
[14:26:23] <bakers> ajpiano: That's an interesting order of operations then...
[14:27:13] <bakers> ajpiano: OH! There is a ( ) I didn't see... now it makes more sense it's (jq=jq.slice(1))
[14:27:21] <bakers> and THEN .length on that whole thing
[14:27:22] <bakers> creative
[14:27:49] <ajpiano> yeah it's a nice terse little trick :D
[14:28:13] <ajpiano> considerably nicer than pegging the CPU
[14:28:14] <ajpiano> :p
[14:28:28] <ravenzz> thepacmanfan can you create a print stylesheet and hide everything except #sb-body-inner ?
[14:28:33] <Dave-Stein> so pac your problem is with this line then huh html = html + "<body><div>http://www.amylinart.com/</div><div id='myprint'>"+$('#sb-container').clone().html()+"</div></body></html>";
[14:28:56] <Dave-Stein> that kinda logic is what you copied and is giving nul;?
[14:29:07] <bakers> ajpiano: Agreed!
[14:29:19] <bakers> ajpiano: Thanks for your help, my brain is slightly less melted now
[14:29:28] <thepacmanfan> Dave-Stein, correct.
[14:29:34] <ajpiano> :)
[14:29:43] <thepacmanfan> i changed the referenced id, but otherwise left it identical
[14:29:49] <ajpiano> and i think you have a better idea of how to deal with async stuff in general
[14:29:57] <thepacmanfan> i tried changing .clone().html()   to just .html()
[14:30:04] <Dave-Stein> are you sure that line is running after the test div is displayed on page?
[14:30:16] <Bower^> I'm pulling in objects from a web API like the following: Object { #text="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/54233597.png", size="extralarge"} silly question but how do I access #text and why does it have the # infront of it? Obviously I access size with Object.size but not sure about the syntax for text
[14:30:16] <thepacmanfan> ravenzz, uhh, perhaps... not sure how that would work
[14:30:19] <Dave-Stein> cause if #blah is on page and you clone it to something it shuold def show there
[14:30:48] <ajpiano> Bower^: try object["#text"]
[14:31:16] <Bower^> cheers ajpiano
[14:31:36] <pcapriotti> can someone help me figure out why this testcase fails intermittently? http://jsfiddle.net/b9JEV/3/
[14:31:53] <thepacmanfan> Dave-Stein, i think so. when i just do .clone() it returns [object Object], which the other guy said was normal
[14:31:54] <ravenzz> thepacmanfan basically the current html is inside that div
[14:32:08] <thepacmanfan> it only returns null when i try and clone the html
[14:32:44] <Dave-Stein> where are you console logging that its giving you object Object? IE?
[14:32:58] <Dave-Stein> well if you clone and get object it SHOULD be the clone of the DIV and then HTML would work on it just fine
[14:33:13] <thepacmanfan> Dave-Stein, nah, it shows up on the page it creates when i hit the print icon
[14:33:27] <thepacmanfan> i can change it real quick
[14:34:02] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano - just checked out the forked plugin and it still doesn't add that class i need
[14:34:13] <ajpiano> :/
[14:34:38] <thepacmanfan> alright, if you do a ctrl+F5 reload of the page you should see the [object Object] when you hit the print icon
[14:34:56] <thepacmanfan> after opening the US distributors of course
[14:35:17] <thepacmanfan> and that's with just .clone()
[14:35:44] <sphinxxx> whats a good plugin for formatting html code in a text area?
[14:35:49] <sphinxxx> with colors etc.
[14:35:50] <Dave-Stein> yeah youre printing that onto the page
[14:35:52] <sphinxxx> and indents
[14:35:53] <Dave-Stein> after your code to put i on page
[14:35:55] <Dave-Stein> console.log it
[14:36:04] <DimmuR> I'm trying to run jquery.tabs from jQuery-ui 1.9 and i still get error messages that i can't find solution for - http://paste.ofcode.org/7b5vteyWtrfkkfwMqgKqrv any ideas?
[14:36:17] <thepacmanfan> guess i don't know how to do that... i have firebug
[14:37:28] <Dave-Stein> var x = $('#el');
[14:37:32] <Dave-Stein> console.log( x );
[14:38:13] <ravenzz> thepacmanfan it works here http://jsfiddle.net/6fRvK/
[14:39:33] <thepacmanfan> humm
[14:39:54] <thepacmanfan> Dave-Stein, and how do i view that then? where does the console log go?
[14:40:08] <Dave-Stein> to the console in firebug :)
[14:40:18] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano - i am an idiot
[14:40:39] <Dave-Stein> i forgot that somewhere else in my codebase someone bound to enable and disable of selects
[14:40:40] <Dave-Stein> *sigh*
[14:44:10] <thepacmanfan> Dave-Stein, it added something to the console...
[14:44:13] <thepacmanfan> [ ]
[14:44:29] <thepacmanfan> jquery "1.4.4"
[14:44:32] <thepacmanfan> length 0
[14:44:40] <thepacmanfan> selector "#print-container"
[14:44:55] <thepacmanfan> so it has the selector right, it just thinks it has no child elements or content?
[14:45:32] <Dave-Stein> in my firebug it console logged an empty array within the main window where i cliked print
[14:45:38] <Dave-Stein> i looked at the selctor since its really a jquery object
[14:45:40] <Dave-Stein> looked for $("#print-container")
[14:45:41] <Dave-Stein> that doesnt exist
[14:47:05] <thepacmanfan> hey! my selector was wrong!
[14:47:30] <thepacmanfan> oh, i know why...
[14:47:45] <thepacmanfan> that selector is no longer there because i'm using inline content.
[14:47:50] <thepacmanfan> ok, it's partly working
[14:48:11] <thepacmanfan> i've got to head home now. one problem solved, but i think i will still have issues when i go back to an iframe
[14:48:23] <thepacmanfan> thanks :)
[14:48:53] <Dave-Stein> yeah you cant use jquery ...
[14:48:55] <Dave-Stein> oh hes gone
[14:48:55] <Dave-Stein> haha
[14:49:12] <Dave-Stein> $('select').live('disable enable', function(e) {
[14:49:16] <Dave-Stein> why would that only fire on enable???
[14:49:48] <Rinthe> how do i add a loading icon for a lightbox type of image viewer

[14:54:25] <Aquaguy> Hello
[14:54:52] <Dave-Stein> hi
[14:55:42] <Aquaguy> I'm trying to get the outerHeight of an element, it has two floating childs, two divs. Instead of outputting the real height it's outputting the addicting of its children's height
[14:56:02] <Aquaguy> any way to get the real height?
[14:56:25] <Dave-Stein> if the children are expanding the parent, then you are getting the real height
[14:56:33] <Aquaguy> they are not
[14:56:43] <Dave-Stein> hmm makea fiddle? that doesnt sound right
[14:56:50] <Dave-Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:56:51] <Aquaguy> both are 200px side by side.
[14:57:20] <thefalling> Im trying to get a tooltip to show a box of data everytime the user hovers over a specific column, and when the hover occurs, a jquery .load should take place, and then the easytooltip should fire its hover function. But its not working right, it seems like its pulling the previous shipInfoDiv, like its showing the div before it finishes the load. Code is here: http://pastebin.com/unnCNSwq
[15:00:07] <thefalling> does the .load function block?
[15:00:29] <Dave-Stein> doesnt .load just bind to load of an element and a div is already loaded?
[15:00:58] <Dave-Stein> or am i mis-remembering?
[15:01:17] <thefalling> not sure
[15:01:53] <Dave-Stein> oh oh i was thinking of wrong thing
[15:02:16] <Dave-Stein> oh that makes sense now
[15:02:20] <Dave-Stein> its nonblocking ajax call
[15:02:27] <Dave-Stein> so if request 2 finishes before request 1, which is entirely possible
[15:02:29] <Dave-Stein> it will show in wrong order
[15:02:40] <bakers> if [1,2] is a two element array, what's (1,2)
[15:02:44] <bakers> it evals two 2?
[15:02:44] <thefalling> damn lol how do i make it block?
[15:03:01] <bakers> var foo = (1,2); # evals to 2
[15:03:03] <Dave-Stein> theres an option somewhere for that
[15:04:03] <Dave-Stein> i never use syntax like that bakers so over my head
[15:04:24] <Dave-Stein> $('select').live('disable', function() {
[15:04:24] <Dave-Stein> console.log('oh hai');
[15:04:24] <Dave-Stein> });
[15:04:24] <Dave-Stein> $('select').trigger('disable'); why would it ony console log there and not again later?
[15:04:58] <Dave-Stein> im guessing something is stopping propagation and i dont know where in this code ughh
[15:05:25] <gnarf> ?mdc comma operator @bakers
[15:05:30] <bot-t> bakers, Comma Operator - MDN Docs - The comma operator evaluates both of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the second operand. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/Comma_Operator

[15:11:11] <Rinthe> how do i add a loading icon for a lightbox type of image viewer
[15:14:31] <discountrobot> one way is to fake a centered div
[15:14:38] <discountrobot> with a gif inside it
[15:15:09] <_numbers> whats the best js system for developing seperate files and then combining them for production?
[15:20:11] <Dave-Stein> does anyone know what version of jquery/ui that if a select is disabled and i trigger, it won't fire?
[15:24:23] <EyePulp> so I've got a <span class='foo bar'></span> that I'm trying to select with $('.bar') under IE8 - it's getting a length of 0 for that selector.  dumb mistake or IE?
[15:30:50] <qbit_> haio - anyone ever run into an issue with $( '#someid' ) not selecting said element .. but document.getElementById( 'someid' ) works?
[15:31:18] <qbit_> also selecting it by it's class name works ( $( '.itsclass' )
[15:32:16] <thefalling> how do i make the .load sync instead of async? do i have to just use the .ajax method? or can i do it through the .load?
[15:34:03] <kurtis> Hey guys. I have a page that is half-hidden based upon what data-set the user is looking at. Everything works great except now I'm implementing a periodical .load() for the content to refresh it every so often. The content is 99% the same but for some reason, my $('.retail-values').hide(); won't work after the first .load call
[15:34:52] <kurtis> I had a similar issue with a click event, and had to use the .live function to solve that problem ? but I'm not sure what to do with this problem
[15:37:05] <Dave-Stein> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:37:08] <Dave-Stein> load doesnt look to take options
[15:37:10] <Dave-Stein> soprobably $.ajax
[15:37:22] <Dave-Stein> can anyone tell if this is a bug or a feature?
[15:37:26] <Dave-Stein> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/bug-or-a-feature-disabled-input-preventing-trigger
[15:44:31] <_bogus_> can anybody tell me why can't i get json object from Facebook's Graph API ? A simple $.getJSON("http://graph.facebook.com/userid") is giving me error on firebug: XMLHttpRequest cannot load ... Origin "http://localhost:3000" is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin . (this happens with any "origin" using console on a site with jquery)
[15:47:40] <_numbers> ya its XSS/CSRF security feature of all browsers
[15:48:03] <_numbers> cant do cross-domain HTTPS or POST
[15:48:13] <_numbers> i thought GET worked though but maybe not
[15:48:25] <_numbers> might also have to do with port
[15:48:28] <_numbers> usually solved by proxying
[15:48:38] <_numbers> or JSONP
[15:48:53] <gataraid> I'm trying to set a session variable with a click of a dropdown, can someone possible guide me in the right direction possibly in accomplishing this?
[15:49:01] <gataraid> I almost got it last night but I fell asleep
[15:49:02] <gataraid> :s
[15:49:19] <_numbers> thats a very broad statement
[15:49:23] <_numbers> try breaking it up
[15:50:18] <gataraid> I had a class set for the dropdown menu, when that class was clicked and it got the value and I was trying to set the session variable with the value of the option in the dropdown clicked
[15:51:36] <gataraid> I was trying to use $.post
[15:51:38] <_numbers> session?
[15:51:47] <_numbers> php?
[15:51:49] <gataraid> Session variables as in PHP
[15:51:49] <gataraid> yes
[15:51:51] <gataraid> yes sir
[15:52:01] <_numbers> might want to ask that part in #Php
[15:52:08] <gataraid> well this is a jquery issue
[15:52:09] <gataraid> not PHP
[15:52:10] <enjoycrf> no ask here
[15:52:25] <_numbers>  $.post('url', { yourvar: yourval }); ?
[15:52:26] <gataraid> This is a JQUERY issue, not PHP
[15:52:59] <enjoycrf> wat u trying to do?
[15:53:03] <gataraid> Hold on, I'll paste in pastebin what I had last night again.  Someone was helping me but I fell asleep.

[15:58:43] <kurtis> any suggestions on skipping jquery's breakpoints when using firebug?
[16:03:47] <zykes-> how does one use redis for example with jquery?
[16:04:25] <kurtis> This is driving me crazy -- Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari will all properly .hide elements after I .load them. However, firefox will hide it for a brief second, and then redisplay it again
[16:09:52] <Rinthe> i thought there was a function in jquery .onload() ?
[16:10:31] <kurtis> Rinthe: umm, there's a .ready
[16:10:38] <Rinthe> oh nm
[16:10:40] <Rinthe> its .load()
[16:10:40] <Rinthe> ;p
[16:10:46] <kurtis> oh haha no problem
[16:16:00] <shoelessone> ping
[16:17:49] <kurtis> pong

[17:19:42] <wathek> how can I do to access the first elements of this json code using js http://pastebin.com/3AxRhZAD ?
[17:22:12] <misterm> wathek: once it's parsed you'll have an array and you just access the first element
[17:22:30] <wathek> misterm, let's say that data contains that information
[17:22:38] <misterm> wathek: I'd note though that passing an unwrapped array like this from the backend can cause security vulnerabilities
[17:22:53] <wathek> one moment I think I got some error in my ajax code
[17:22:57] <wathek> I'm not getting json code
[17:23:40] <wathek> misterm, yep I forget the dataType
[17:23:40] <wathek> ;)
[17:23:44] <wathek> thank you misterm

[18:03:21] <Eviltwin> Hey, guys, jQuery question
[18:03:31] <Eviltwin> I'm trying to make a dynamic HTML structure
[18:03:45] <coldhead> cool
[18:03:46] <Eviltwin> And I'm a fan of the low-variable syntaxes
[18:03:47] <coldhead> like a video
[18:04:18] <Eviltwin> Inside a call to .append
[18:04:27] <Eviltwin> I'd like to feed it the result of a $.map
[18:04:42] <Eviltwin> That takes a structure and returns jQuery objects
[18:04:50] <Eviltwin> Text Notation -> HTML
[18:05:00] <Eviltwin> That call to map will produce an array of jQuery objects
[18:05:06] <Eviltwin> Which is really a 2D array
[18:05:13] <Eviltwin> And .append will only take a 1D array at best
[18:05:44] <Eviltwin> Any ideas?
[18:06:15] <Eviltwin> Can I take an array of jQuery objects and make them into one?
[18:07:16] <coldhead> Eviltwin: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[18:07:26] <Kamakazi> thebignoise: Thanks, looks like what I need
[18:07:58] <Eviltwin> Does that merge n arrays together?
[18:08:11] <coldhead> it does
[18:08:25] <Eviltwin> And array of arrays?
[18:09:49] <coldhead> i have never tried that
[18:10:07] <coldhead> but it seems a reasonable line to start experimenting down
[18:10:22] <dilvie> using jQuery 1.6, I have a situation where .offset is returning the position of an element relative to the screen, while firefox returns the position of the element relative to the document -- so when you scroll, chrome's offset value changes, but firefox remains constant.
[18:10:39] <dilvie> I actually prefer the position relative to the screen -- is there a consistent way to get that?
[18:10:40] <Eviltwin> $.merge.apply(null,[$("<span>"),$("<span>")]) works but its ugly
[18:10:47] <jdevel> I'm relatively new to jquery but not javascript.  I'm working on creating a quick plugin and was wondering what the best way to get to access the element(s)?  When I use this, it's referring to the jQuery object.  I can access the element by using the zero index such as this[0] and I get my element.  Is this the best way to access it?
[18:11:04] <Eviltwin> And actually merge will only take the two args
[18:11:06] <dilvie> jdevel: yes
[18:11:13] <jdevel> thank you
[18:11:55] <dilvie> jdevel: note that will only give you the first element, though.. obviously you get an array of elements when you have a jquery object.
[18:11:57] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects are pseudo arrays at heart
[18:12:07] <jdevel> of course
[18:12:08] <Eviltwin> You can loop over them like an array
[18:12:11] <jdevel> based on selector
[18:12:37] <dilvie> so... element offset relative to the screen - cross browser. Anybody?
[18:12:40] <jdevel> still playing around with it, but so far I'm impressed with jQuery
[18:13:12] <Eviltwin> Makes a lot of very verbose DOM things a lot less verbose
[18:13:20] <coldhead> dilvie: ask the user to get out a tape measure? :P
[18:13:39] <Eviltwin> Also with chaining and a lot of functions that can accept any number of arguments, it makes it really easy to make really unreadable code :P
[18:14:12] <coldhead> that's true in any language
[18:14:16] <coldhead> but ya, esp. with callbacks
[18:14:19] <coldhead> callback spagetthi
[18:14:27] <Eviltwin> Chained callbacks
[18:14:29] <jdevel> dilvie: i've actually written a script for that
[18:14:38] <Eviltwin> AJAX -> Result -> AJAX -> Result -> ...
[18:15:10] <coldhead> yo dawg i heard you like callbacks
[18:15:15] <Eviltwin> dilvie: Probably have to do a subtraction against scrollTop or something
[18:15:17] <dilvie> coldhead: that is a brilliant solution! Why didn't I think of that?
[18:15:24] <dilvie> coldhead: hollaback!
[18:15:53] <jdevel> travers the DOM to get the elements position on the document, and grab available screen dimensions
[18:16:04] <dilvie> eviltwin: ah, but subtract what? .offset() is giving me the position relative to the viewport in webkit!
[18:16:14] <wathek> I got a problem I'm trying to call a function that's outside the $(document).ready() function and get the returned value but it seems that it calls it with no problem but I always get undefined for the returned value
[18:16:17] <dilvie> which is great... I mean, that's what I really wanted.
[18:16:27] <Eviltwin> .offset() is supposed to be relative to the document
[18:16:30] <dilvie> but firefox gives me the position relative to the document.
[18:16:38] <Eviltwin> wathek: What function
[18:16:39] <dilvie> Eviltwin: yeah. funny, eh?
[18:16:49] <wathek> Eviltwin, a function that I've written
[18:16:53] <Eviltwin> dilvie: Can you make a jsfiddle?
[18:16:59] <wathek> Eviltwin, sure
[18:17:19] <dilvie> maybe..
[18:17:24] <Spadeski> Whats jsfiddle ?

[18:22:55] <gataraid> eviltwin I'm not sure if its not getting the proper element attr or what
[18:22:59] <gataraid> to set the $POST value
[18:23:29] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Are you using the Safari/Chrome debug tools or Firebug?
[18:23:35] <gataraid> firebug
[18:23:52] <Eviltwin> That should show you network activity
[18:23:57] <Eviltwin> And allow you to set a breakpoint in your code
[18:24:00] <gataraid> Spadeski well that session value is set according to an account, I need the session to be set by a click or a dropdown
[18:24:03] <Eviltwin> At which point you can access variables in that scope
[18:24:08] <gataraid> and then it to load a module though
[18:24:13] <gataraid> similar to what you're doing, yes
[18:24:19] <gataraid> it's not really a module
[18:24:23] <gataraid> it's an image div
[18:24:57] <Spadeski> yea
[18:25:01] <Spadeski> waitup pm me
[18:25:05] <Spadeski> for codeski
[18:27:38] <wathek> Eviltwin, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/zudYc/
[18:28:11] <Eviltwin> You're lucky I was working with this API just yesterday
[18:29:18] <Eviltwin> wathek: The problem is geocoder.geocode is asynchronous
[18:29:38] <Eviltwin> wathek: Have you used callback functions before?
[18:32:17] <wathek> Eviltwin, nope
[18:33:11] <Eviltwin> Okay, let me do some fiddling for you
[18:33:12] <wathek> Eviltwin, how can I use callback functions with that ?
[18:33:20] <wathek> Eviltwin, ok thank you so much
[18:37:24] <EMKO> anyidea how i can update a ifram from a windw.open popup? im trying to get the iframe to load a different page based on what happens in the popup window
[18:38:11] <Eviltwin> wathek: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[18:38:25] <wathek> let me take a look at it
[18:38:41] <Eviltwin> It won't show anything but it you can read the code
[18:39:19] <wathek> yes
[18:44:48] <infinite-scale> is it possible to upload a file and submit data via jquery.post?
[18:45:38] <wathek> yeah it works Eviltwin
[18:45:41] <wathek> thank you so much
[18:46:17] <Eviltwin> No problem
[18:47:50] <infinite-scale> I can't find any resources regarding my problem. Do i miss something?
[18:48:24] <jdevel> I'm working on a jquery plugin, i'm using an object for default settings and extending them by passing in an object literal.  The question is what is the best way to pass a DOM element in as a value?  ie. $('#myDiv').myPlugin({abutton:$('#aButton')[0]});  Or is there a better practice for this?
[18:49:11] <Eviltwin> Can you work with a jQuery object?
[18:49:38] <jdevel> Eviltwin: Me?
[18:50:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:50:35] <jdevel> my understanding is that $('#aButton')[0] will return the DOM element with the ID aButton.
[18:51:15] <cgsawtell> Heya is it possible to use http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ to toggle a paragraph inside a div with the id? like: ('#foo').p.toggleClass(className, addOrRemove);
[18:51:47] <Eviltwin> jdevel: It will but why are you making your plugin require a DOM element rather than the jQuery object?
[18:51:59] <jdevel> it doesn't require it
[18:52:16] <jdevel> the idea is to allow someone to pass a div or whatever in as a button to include as a control
[18:52:37] <jdevel> rather than including a bloated css file with the plugin
[18:52:40] <Eviltwin> cgsawtell: $('#foo p').toggleClass(className, addOrRemove)
[18:52:56] <cgsawtell> Eviltwin:  awesome thanks!
[18:53:17] <Eviltwin> jdevel: I recommend allowing them to pass in a jQuery object
[18:53:28] <Eviltwin> The easiest way to allow this is to wrap the input with $()
[18:53:43] <Eviltwin> $(jQuery Object) -> jQuery Object, $(DOM Element) -> jQuery Object
[18:54:14] <jdevel> would that have more overhead than just the DOM element?
[18:54:33] <Eviltwin> You're dealing with JavaScript, it's basically the overhead langauge
[18:54:35] <Eviltwin> language*
[18:55:34] <jdevel> how would I add it as a jquery object without using a selector if I'm accessing it via ID?
[18:55:49] <jdevel> and not using document.getEleme..
[18:56:40] <Eviltwin> It's a lot nicer to type $('#myDiv').myPlugin({abutton:$('#aButton')}); instead of $('#myDiv').myPlugin({abutton:$('#aButton')[0]});
[18:57:10] <jdevel> ohhhh
[18:57:12] <jdevel> I see
[18:57:21] <jdevel> since it's only returning one object..
[18:57:29] <Eviltwin> Now let's say you want to accept both syntaxes
[18:57:30] <jdevel> no need to ref by index
[18:57:42] <Eviltwin> In your code you can do $(parameters.abutton)
[18:58:03] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/gL1gb9cr I get the proper alert, but the session isn't being set by the post
[18:58:04] <Eviltwin> And regardless of whether it was a DOM Element, jQuery Object, or even the HTML string, it'll come in as a jQuery object
[18:58:26] <jdevel> parameters is a reserved object?
[18:58:45] <Eviltwin> parameters being the thing that came into your function
[18:58:48] <Eviltwin> I don't know what you called it
[18:58:59] <Eviltwin> If you're using UI Widget, I think it's this.options
[18:59:00] <slaeke> hey all, I'm having a problem with preventdefault not working
[18:59:21] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Are you sure it's not PHP?
[18:59:23] <slaeke> http://www.sushifaq.com/dev/sushi-health/calories-in-sushi/ is the page, the script is called "tables.js
[18:59:38] <jdevel> hmm
[18:59:51] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Also look at .val()
[18:59:53] <Eviltwin> ? .val
[18:59:53] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[19:00:15] * infinite-scale is getting frustrated :(
[19:00:19] <Eviltwin> slaeke: What are you preventing?
[19:00:31] <gataraid> Eviltwin, I'm pretty sure
[19:00:33] <Eviltwin> infinite-scale: No
[19:00:42] <slaeke> just a click
[19:00:44] <slaeke> on a link
[19:00:44] <Eviltwin> infinite-scale: And we have no obligation to help you
[19:00:52] <slaeke> but its not happening
[19:00:55] <Eviltwin> Which linK?
[19:01:14] <gataraid> var value = $(this).val(); ?
[19:01:15] <slaeke> all the dark tabs in the .calories div
[19:01:21] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Yeah
[19:01:41] <slaeke> basically, there's 5 tables, i'm positioning all but the current one off the page with a class
[19:01:45] <infinite-scale> Eviltwin not frustrated because of not getting help immediately or at all, getting frustrated, because I didn't get it working yet :D
[19:01:46] <slaeke> called .off_left
[19:02:15] <gataraid> Eviltwin gets the message still but doesn't set the value for the session
[19:02:17] <jdevel> I'm sure what you just told me will click soon, I literally started to teach myself jquery only hours ago.  I've been writing javascript since the 90's and just never bothered.. now I'm kicking myself.. I wrote my own js animation library a while ago and had been using that for projects.. however I can't keep up with the jquery community.. so i figured it was time to start to be a contributer.  It's a damn slick library.
[19:02:21] <slaeke> the click function adds a class that positions all the tables off the left side of the page, then is supposed to remove that class for the right table...
[19:02:25] <gataraid> because var_dump() still says NULL
[19:02:52] <courpse> gataraid, You need echo inside your <?php ?> path.
[19:03:42] <courpse> gataraid, <?php bloginfo('template_url');?> does nothing, unless bloginfo echos inside the function.
[19:03:51] <gataraid> it does echo
[19:03:53] <Eviltwin> slaeke: It's because it's not geting to the preventDefault statement
[19:03:55] <gataraid> and it does output the right path
[19:03:59] <EMKO> on my page i click login and this opens a iframe using colorbox and in the iframe i click a button this loads a window.open popup how can i change the url of the iframe from my popup window?
[19:03:59] <courpse> aight, /me continues to lurk.
[19:04:00] <Eviltwin> Because :nth-child(id) is not valid syntax
[19:04:14] <Eviltwin> You need to put in an integer instead of an id
[19:04:19] <Eviltwin> Instead of the string id
[19:04:26] <slaeke> i thought about that. how do I incorporate a variable into that though?
[19:04:33] <slaeke> I prefer to have that be a variable
[19:04:42] <Eviltwin> You know how to concatenate JavaScript strings?
[19:04:49] <slaeke> i tried that
[19:04:54] <slaeke> it didnt work either
[19:04:58] <slaeke> lemme try it one more time
[19:04:58] <gataraid> I FIGURED IT OUT HAHAHA
[19:05:00] <Eviltwin> var id=12; alert("nth-child("+id+")")
[19:05:11] <slaeke> ahhh i was using "."
[19:05:14] <infinite-scale> damn there has to be a solution...
[19:05:17] <slaeke> guess thats PHP concat not js
[19:05:17] <slaeke> haha
[19:05:21] <Eviltwin> Nope
[19:05:25] <slaeke> whoops
[19:05:26] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is like Java
[19:05:29] <slaeke> one sec, lemme try again
[19:05:42] <jdevel> EMKO, you will have to use the calling window to get back to the document to access the iframe i believe
[19:06:30] <slaeke> ok, so the prevent default is working now
[19:06:37] <slaeke> but the tables arent all showing right
[19:06:38] <jdevel> sorry it's window.opener
[19:07:04] <jdevel> traverse back that way I believe
[19:07:32] <danieliser> is it more efficient to load all results of a table into json and filter/paginate from that o to make ajax calls to update/filter/paginate?
[19:08:09] <jdevel> your talking about a database table?
[19:08:19] <danieliser> yes.. client table..
[19:08:44] <jdevel> it's more efficient to filter at the query to the database.
[19:09:34] <jdevel> always faster to process less data
[19:10:42] <danieliser> ok.. thats what i thought but ive seen other methods.. wanted to be sure i do it right in my app from the get go.
[19:11:24] <infinite-scale> sorry for posting again: any ideas on how to upload a file and additionally submit some textinputs to the server?
[19:11:56] <jdevel> yes, minimizing your data at the database is always going to be faster.. that is another reason triggers and stored procedures are nice.. the database caches them and runs the queries much faster than using php or another serverside language to so all the processing
[19:12:56] <jdevel> you need to use multipart/form-data in for form
[19:13:24] <slaeke> @Eviltwin: got it working, thanks!
[19:13:31] <infinite-scale> jdevel, yeah did that, sending the text input seems fine, but how to transfer the file?
[19:13:56] <jdevel> enctype="multipart/form-data"
[19:14:13] <jdevel> what server side language?
[19:14:48] <infinite-scale> python
[19:14:56] <coldhead> python.com python?
[19:15:10] <infinite-scale> python.org python :D
[19:15:21] <dv310p3r>  Anyone with experience using JavascriptMVC?
[19:15:29] <jdevel> well, are you getting the file size from the request variables?
[19:16:04] <jdevel> once uploaded it will be in a temp directory.. after that you must move the file to the directory you want it to live.
[19:17:12] <jdevel> at least this is the php behavior
[19:17:14] <abjorn> geez coldhead, get it right
[19:17:30] <infinite-scale> jdevel, I think the problem i have is a bit earlier.
[19:17:54] <infinite-scale> but I'll try to work it out
[19:19:57] <jdevel> have you been able to test if it's been submitted?
[19:20:12] <jdevel> are you selecting the file from a control?
[19:20:12] <abjorn> http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Plain-Old-Regexs.aspx
[19:21:24] <infinite-scale> I try to select it from the hdd of my user, using the type=file from html forms
[19:21:37] <infinite-scale> and then tried to upload it to the server.
[19:21:42] <jdevel> infinate-scale: this is a routine I did using php.. maybe looking will help here's a chunk http://pastebin.com/G5dR3t6C
[19:21:51] <infinite-scale> thanks
[19:22:18] <jdevel> you might also have permission issues..
[19:22:20] <jdevel> check that too
[19:23:14] <infinite-scale> but that is just uploading the file. could it be that submitting a file and additional text data to the server is just not working great?
[19:23:35] <jdevel> what web server are you running?
[19:23:50] <infinite-scale> right now just the development python server
[19:24:31] <jdevel> don't the files run on a web server of some sort like apache2 or something with python modules
[19:25:33] <jdevel> any server side programming I've done had a web server that processing the scripts and splits out the html to the client
[19:26:15] <jdevel> you running this on a linux machine?
[19:26:40] <Phrogz_> jdevel: Like Ruby, I suspect Python has standalone web servers available that serve content themselves.
[19:27:02] <jdevel> for development i guess
[19:27:03] <jdevel> yea
[19:27:03] <Phrogz_> It's not the most performant setup in the world, but super convenient for getting up and running and testing, without reverse-proxy configuration.
[19:27:21] <jdevel> i've never really ran into and of those issues
[19:27:32] <jdevel> setup some virtual machines
[19:27:41] <jdevel> and just run a production level web server
[19:28:14] <jdevel> apache2 has been pretty solid for me
[19:29:11] <jdevel> then all you need to do is setup virtual domains and no reverse-proxy is needed, unless your trying to redirect traffic to another box using port 80 as well.
[19:31:56] <jdevel> anyhow, thank you all for any help you have provided.   I will be back a little later to do my part.. for now back to coding.
[19:32:01] <infinite-scale> jdevel, yeah just a build in development server for extra debugging
[19:32:11] <infinite-scale> thanks for your help jdevel
[19:32:17] <jdevel> I didn't help too much
[19:32:32] <jdevel> I would check out permissions
[19:32:43] <jdevel> as well as some config settings on files size limits etc.
[19:33:09] <jdevel> best of luck on that thought
[19:33:23] <boshhead> I'm confused about: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#Ajax_mode -- it says "obviously this degrades gracefully" -- but obviously it doesn't, because the href= needs to be different depending on whether a user has javascript or not. If they have javascript, it should load only the content within the tab. But if they don't have javascript, it needs to load something that has _everything_, including the container.
[19:33:25] <cgsawtell> $('#nestscontainer').hasClass('nestselected').toggleClass('nestfilter'); anyone have any idea why this isn't toggling the class?
[19:33:35] <jdevel> though*  I wish I could help more, I just don't use Python much.
[19:33:41] <cgsawtell> I'm pretty sure I'm doing something completely retarded
[19:34:08] <jdevel> is nestscontainer right?
[19:34:15] <jdevel> all the others are just nest
[19:34:21] <cgsawtell> should be
[19:34:54] <cgsawtell> is that looking in that container or am I doing it completely wrong?
[19:35:19] <cgsawtell> oh is that looking for items with that id?
[19:35:25] <jdevel> well is the hasClass fails it will still link the chain so you could call toggleClass on nothing in theory
[19:36:09] <jdevel> I'm still learning though.. I don't think you should listen to me on this one.
[19:36:15] <cgsawtell> what I'm trying to do is look in a div for a p with that class and toggle it for another
[19:36:34] <jdevel> you should be able to do that with a selector
[19:37:19] <Z3R0_> ('#div').find('p').find('.class').action ? // ?
[19:37:19] <jdevel> something like $('#elemID p:class="theclass"')
[19:37:27] <Z3R0_> oh that makes more sense
[19:37:37] <imsky> that'll be slow
[19:37:46] <jdevel> mine?
[19:37:50] <imsky> yeah, likely
[19:38:02] <imsky> it's beautiful, but likely slow :)
[19:38:02] <jdevel> seems it would be faster than using multi finds
[19:38:08] <coldhead> meh just get a faster gombuter
[19:38:12] <Z3R0_> ya I think he meant mine
[19:38:18] <imsky> no, jdevel's
[19:38:20] <Z3R0_> o.o
[19:38:31] <jdevel> looks like a valid css3 selector
[19:38:38] <cgsawtell> how slow is slow?
[19:38:53] <imsky> http://jsperf.com can answer that
[19:38:56] <jdevel> also depends on how many elements fit that description
[19:39:11] <cgsawtell> like 0.3 second instead of 0.2 secs of 3 second instead of 0.1sec?
[19:39:14] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[19:39:14] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[19:39:26] <imsky> here come the bromides
[19:39:35] <jdevel> I'm interested to see the results
[19:39:39] <imsky> consider the slowest piece of crap on planet earth: ie6
[19:39:41] <jdevel> test it
[19:39:46] <imsky> and then consider another slow piece of crap: mobile webkit
[19:39:56] <imsky> that's what you're optimizing for
[19:40:11] <cgsawtell> I'll try jdevels first 'cause no offence Z3R0  but it's more elegant
[19:40:12] <imsky> if you'd really like me to test it, i'll need the html, if it exists
[19:40:15] <imsky> i just came in
[19:40:30] <abjorn> imskay
[19:40:32] <abjorn> pimpskay
[19:40:34] <imsky> hay baby
[19:40:39] <abjorn> sup bromosexual
[19:40:41] <imsky> lolol
[19:40:49] <imsky> watching paul boag talking about design
[19:40:54] <imsky> and...designing
[19:41:01] <abjorn> sounds super fascinating
[19:41:08] <imsky> that's why i'm not going into detail
[19:41:13] <imsky> the fascinatingness of it is off the charts
[19:41:30] <imsky> i'm getting pretty good at figuring out what speakers are a waste of time though
[19:41:58] <imsky> i think in one thumbnail i saw the speaker wearing a pirate hat
[19:42:06] <coldhead> i'd be a time waster
[19:42:06] <imsky> that's just telegraphing "skip me"
[19:42:09] <coldhead> no question
[19:42:17] <cgsawtell> jdevel:  that completely broke it..
[19:42:27] <Z3R0_> none taken lol
[19:42:32] <imsky> haw haw
[19:42:41] <cgsawtell> $('#nestscontainer p:class="nestselected"').toggleClass('nestfilter'); like that right?
[19:42:42] <imsky> abjorn: what's going on in breezy texas?
[19:43:09] <abjorn> heat

[19:43:59] <abjorn> lol
[19:44:09] <abjorn> austin is like hipster central so naturally lotta web devs here ;)
[19:44:12] <imsky> yeah
[19:44:20] <imsky> people in indiana go to austin to find themselves
[19:44:26] <abjorn> roflmao
[19:44:30] <Z3R0_> then they realize it was a mistake and run back
[19:44:40] <imsky> lol
[19:44:42] <abjorn> and us native austinites say "good fucking riddance"
[19:45:03] <imsky> ahh texas
[19:45:09] <Z3R0_> no offense to those Lousiannians or w/e, but damn when they all flocked here, our electricity crashed -_-
[19:45:16] <abjorn> lol
[19:45:16] <Z3R0_> I'm tired of people commuting to austin
[19:45:28] <abjorn> i dont care i just want this heat to go away
[19:45:31] <imsky> didn't realize it was a problem
[19:45:34] <Z3R0_> probably why it's 100+ here (all body heat)
[19:45:38] <imsky> isn't D/FW becoming another hot spot
[19:45:38] <abjorn> and i want it to rain so my house doesnt burn to the ground
[19:45:46] <abjorn> not for hipsters
[19:45:46] <imsky> got some rain last night, abjorn
[19:45:49] <abjorn> d/fw sucks
[19:45:51] <imsky> thunderstorms ALL WEEK UP IN HEA
[19:45:54] <cgsawtell> Z3R0: your's didn't work ether
[19:46:03] <imsky> cgsawtell: let me do it, what's the problem?
[19:46:04] <abjorn> d/fw and houston are shit
[19:46:05] <Z3R0_> I didn't think mine would, it was merely a logical guess on my end lol
[19:46:14] <abjorn> Austin is like the only good place in Texas
[19:46:30] <imsky> lol
[19:46:36] <Z3R0_> well ya, everywhere is either a blink of an eye, or you're stuck in traffic for 5 hrs
[19:46:37] <imsky> the portland of texas
[19:46:51] <abjorn> yeah basically, imsky
[19:47:00] <imsky> oh yeah bro
[19:47:03] <imsky> i posted on that twitter
[19:47:06] <imsky> batman.js is out
[19:47:07] <Z3R0_> They don't call us the live music capital of the world for nothing ^_^
[19:47:13] <abjorn> oh fuck buddy
[19:47:15] <imsky> i figure you're a js hipster, you should be interested
[19:47:39] <abjorn> lol
[19:47:45] <abjorn> i will
[19:47:47] <imsky> native coffeescript FOR everything
[19:47:48] <abjorn> probably never ever use it
[19:47:49] <coldhead> chicago is the true live music capital
[19:47:50] <abjorn> oh
[19:47:52] <imsky> combine that shit with twitter's bootstrap
[19:47:53] <abjorn> then i definitely wont
[19:47:56] <coldhead> i will fight anyone who disputes that
[19:47:56] <imsky> which just came out too
[19:47:59] <coldhead> in the street
[19:48:02] <abjorn> coldhead
[19:48:05] <abjorn> I will punch you in your jaw
[19:48:06] <abjorn> just sayin
[19:48:12] <imsky> what
[19:48:16] <coldhead> i will cram a chess piece in your eye
[19:48:22] <abjorn> I will stick my di-nevermind
[19:48:25] <coldhead> i've done it before
[19:48:30] <Eviltwin> Anyoen have any ideas for this: http://jsfiddle.net/JVpGU/
[19:48:33] <neteffect> hi
[19:48:34] <Eviltwin> Anyone*
[19:48:46] <abjorn> imsky: coffeescript is neat and all i just dont want to use it
[19:48:47] <neteffect> i want to refresh a page every 30 seconds
[19:48:52] <imsky> abjorn: they let you use native js
[19:48:59] <imsky> it's just the Ruby(tm) way
[19:49:08] <abjorn> i bet it sucks without coffeescript tho ;(
[19:49:15] <imsky> yeah i don't really want to risk it
[19:49:20] <imsky> i think it speaks to the dichotomy of developers
[19:49:27] <imsky> mac = ruby, coffeescript; pc = php, js
[19:49:44] <abjorn> really, cause I'm pc = js, js
[19:49:48] <imsky> yeah
[19:49:50] <Eviltwin> I'm a Mac person and I do PHP and JS
[19:49:51] <imsky> that's like...linux
[19:49:58] <abjorn> I *do* use Linux a lot...
[19:50:00] <Eviltwin> But I've always associated myself with UNIX/Linux
[19:50:04] <imsky> lol
[19:50:08] <imsky> i'm a win/lin guy
[19:50:10] <abjorn> same
[19:50:18] <abjorn> I'm far from an Apple fan :p
[19:50:23] <imsky> oh yeah poor steve
[19:50:23] <abjorn> you might call me...a hater
[19:50:32] <abjorn> steve can go fuck himself, just sayin
[19:50:44] <imsky> harsh words for an old bro
[19:51:04] <abjorn> well he's kind of a dick
[19:51:07] <imsky> anyway, rubyists are kinda interested in setting up their own ghettos
[19:51:11] <abjorn> rofl
[19:51:12] <imsky> textmate/ror/coffeescript/sass
[19:51:18] <imsky> or /less
[19:51:27] <abjorn> I stopped using sass btw
[19:51:29] <abjorn> got tired of it
[19:51:34] <imsky> who the hell wouldn't
[19:51:43] <coldhead> harsh
[19:51:54] <abjorn> I wanted to try less but then I was like
[19:52:07] <abjorn> "fuck it, it's not THAT much more work to use native css"
[19:52:09] <imsky> nobody outside of weirdos use that
[19:52:16] <imsky> except for twitter
[19:52:23] <abjorn> well they *are* kind of weirdos
[19:52:24] <imsky> but really
[19:52:26] <imsky> yeah
[19:52:42] <imsky> http://twitter.com/jobs
[19:52:43] <socialhapy> â˜… jobs has protected tweets
[19:52:46] <imsky> i saw this a while ago
[19:52:53] <imsky> and it made me _not_ want to work at twitter
[19:53:17] <abjorn> LOL just looking at the group photo
[19:53:17] <abjorn> im like
[19:53:19] <abjorn> "nah"
[19:53:21] <cgsawtell> imsky: ok I'm modifying a plugin called  jQuery Content Panel Switcher to highlight what option you've selected. to do this I have two css classes once that has a different colour to the unselected one. I've gotten it to swap to the selected class, but I want to swap the old selected item to the unselected class before I change the class to selected class because atm it just keeps them both selected. http://pastebin.com/e0anUree < code
[19:53:22] <imsky> yeah play the video
[19:53:29] <abjorn> im afraid imsky
[19:53:36] <imsky> DO IT FOR TEXAS
[19:53:38] <imsky> you loves it
[19:53:52] <abjorn> how can one company have so much hipster
[19:54:59] <imsky> at about 1:10
[19:55:03] <imsky> a room full of macbooks
[19:55:06] <abjorn> that too
[19:55:14] <imsky> they're probably company issued, but man
[19:55:18] <abjorn> man, batman.js just looks like so much more than I'll ever need
[19:55:24] <abjorn> just like every other framework...
[19:55:26] <imsky> haha do you not use any framework?
[19:55:33] <abjorn> yeah
[19:55:35] <abjorn> like i try but
[19:55:49] <abjorn> it just never sticks
[19:55:55] <imsky> i'll have to for my next big project
[19:56:06] <imsky> i'm at the point where doing it the simple way is a big pain in the ass
[19:56:16] <neilk_> I have a set of items I want to optionally filter
[19:56:19] <abjorn> I always just go back to the module model. var App = { init : function () { /* stuff */ };
[19:56:28] <imsky> cgsawtell: sorry, i'll get right to reading that
[19:56:28] <neilk_> is there a jquery selector expression that always returns the same thing?
[19:56:46] <Z3R0_> what?
[19:56:49] <neilk_> e.g.  $('h1').find( /* ??? */ ) always returns the same h1.
[19:56:50] <imsky> abjorn: you use any design patterns besides module?
[19:56:59] <cgsawtell> imsky: sweet  thanks for your help:)
[19:57:12] <imsky> cgsawtell: is this live anywhere?
[19:57:15] <neilk_> I'm asking if there's a way to have an "identity" selector
[19:57:20] <imsky> neilk_: wat
[19:57:28] <abjorn> Yeah, imsky, just writing one function that does all my javascripts :D
[19:57:35] <abjorn> jk thats just for small websites
[19:57:36] <Z3R0_> what are you trying to do exactly ?
[19:57:38] <imsky> your code must be the playground bully
[19:57:50] <abjorn> In like a real JS app I'd never do that of course
[19:57:57] <imsky> word up
[19:58:00] <neilk_> imsky, Z3R0_ -- I would like to have a function like this
[19:58:14] <neilk_> function getAllTheListItemsOptionallyFilteredBySomething( selector ) {
[19:58:16] <imsky> abjorn: i forget if i've asked you this, how much php have you coded?
[19:58:20] <abjorn> idk ive played around with MVC in client side, with backbone.js, but it just doesn't feel right for me, for the client side anyways
[19:58:25] <cgsawtell> imsky: no
[19:58:30] <neilk_> $container.find( 'li' ).filter( selector );
[19:58:31] <neilk_> }
[19:58:34] <neilk_> but!
[19:58:34] <abjorn> a decent amount, never any big finished site or anything, but I somewhat know my way around it
[19:58:39] <cgsawtell> I can put it on dropbox if you want
[19:58:40] <imsky> cgsawtell: hmm ok, give me some more time
[19:58:53] <imsky> abjorn: damn, i'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to transition from php to js
[19:58:59] <imsky> but i probably should wait a couple of years
[19:59:00] <abjorn> like for the server end?
[19:59:02] <neilk_> imsky: so what is the selector I can use to mean "never mind, just give me all the li's"
[19:59:03] <imsky> yeah
[19:59:10] <imsky> neilk_: $("li")
[19:59:18] <neilk_> *thunk*
[19:59:23] <abjorn> Well, I thoroughly enjoy it. I mean, I work a lot faster in JS just because it's my favorite (and my best) language
[19:59:24] <neilk_> That's already in the code.
[19:59:33] <imsky> neilk_: so what's your problem soldier
[19:59:33] <neilk_> never mind, I found it, it's "*"
[19:59:41] <imsky> lol good luck with that bro
[19:59:45] <imsky> now you're pulling in HEAD
[19:59:52] <imsky> abjorn: how many other languages do you know
[20:00:02] <neilk_> imsky:    the question is   $('li').filter( something )
[20:00:03] <abjorn> Of course the problem is the only real framework for node (express) doesn't do nearly as much as other frameworks like django or ror
[20:00:16] <imsky> neilk_: i'm not really paying attention, just go along with it
[20:00:16] <neilk_> imsky: the question is, what is the something if I just want ALL the list items after all.
[20:00:31] <abjorn> imsky: C, C++, C#, Python, Lua, PHP, and some of various other languages (Scheme, Ruby, etc)
[20:00:47] <imsky> abjorn: how many of those would you do a complex app in?
[20:01:02] <imsky> cgsawtell: which lines am i looking at?
[20:01:15] <Z3R0_> wouldn't * give you all as well ?
[20:01:20] <abjorn> Depends on what kind of app we're talking about. If we're tlaking a web app then, Python and JS would be my only choices. I could in PHP but I'd rather not
[20:01:36] <imsky> abjorn: cool. you ever use....vala?
[20:01:48] <abjorn> never heard of it
[20:01:51] <imsky> look it up
[20:01:58] <imsky> c# that compiles to native c with gobj
[20:01:59] <cgsawtell> imsky: 13,14. 14 works $('#nestscontainer').find('p').find('.nestselected').toggleClass('nestfilter');
[20:01:59] <cgsawtell> 			$('p',this).toggleClass('nestselected');
[20:02:06] <imsky> er c#-like
[20:02:18] <imsky> cgsawtell: gotcha
[20:02:43] <imsky> abjorn: at one point it looked like vaporware, but now it looks like the BEST option for native apps on linux
[20:02:57] <imsky> and windows of coarse
[20:03:45] <cgsawtell> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453825/magpie-posthandin/help.html
[20:03:47] <abjorn> neato
[20:03:50] <imsky> cgsawtell: ok can you lay out which classes respond to which state and what you want to happen in what order?
[20:03:59] <abjorn> although there's always mono for C# on linux
[20:04:05] <imsky> abjorn: yeah but that's mono
[20:04:10] <imsky> this is gobj/gtk
[20:04:12] <abjorn> lol
[20:04:15] <imsky> faaast
[20:04:20] <cgsawtell> imsky: that is the page in question
[20:04:24] <imsky> it's basically new C
[20:04:28] <imsky> or..a workable D
[20:04:35] <imsky> cgsawtell: thanks bro, let me take a look
[20:04:36] <abjorn> mono is pretty fast too, actually, it's gotten really nice lately.
[20:04:41] <abjorn> but yeah compiling to C would be even better
[20:04:42] <abjorn> that sound sneat
[20:04:46] <imsky> yeah i know, but .NET is another thing
[20:04:50] <imsky> oh and for you python fans
[20:04:56] <imsky> there's a dialect, geanie
[20:04:59] <imsky> resembles boo
[20:05:18] <cgsawtell> I want all .nestselected classes to be changed to nestfilter before the selected one gets changed from nestfilter to nestselected
[20:05:27] <imsky> gotcha
[20:05:38] <imsky> give me about 2-3 mins
[20:05:41] <cgsawtell> kk
[20:06:01] <abjorn> look at you, imsky, solving the worlds problems
[20:06:08] <imsky> i'm burnt out from work
[20:06:12] <imsky> want to help the COMMUNITY
[20:06:29] <imsky> i've been running around earlier trying to ship a laptop battery overseas
[20:06:36] <imsky> nobody wants to let me do it
[20:06:52] <imsky> it's been a weird day
[20:07:06] <cgsawtell> imsky: what do you do for a living?
[20:07:13] <jdevel> imsky, did you ever run those tests?
[20:07:13] <imsky> i don't ship damn batteries
[20:07:27] <imsky> cgsawtell: freelance web designer and jquery dev
[20:07:36] <abjorn> idk i like to help people here but its like thats all I do at work so lol
[20:07:39] <imsky> jdevel: i'm actually helping the guy write a selector that works
[20:07:45] <jdevel> lol
[20:07:58] <imsky> you can run the tests same as me, bro
[20:08:01] <abjorn> whatchya need jdevel
[20:08:05] <abjorn> imskys all busy n shit
[20:08:12] <imsky> seriously i'm mother teresa up in hea
[20:08:12] <jdevel> I suppose the one I pseudo'd wasn't working
[20:08:24] <abjorn> psuedo'd
[20:08:25] <abjorn> that should be
[20:08:26] <abjorn> a thing
[20:08:31] <imsky> cgsawtell: is there only one .nestselected?
[20:08:56] <cgsawtell> ideally
[20:09:05] <imsky> so there's a possibility of >1?
[20:09:09] <imsky> this is math, bro
[20:09:11] <imsky> not philosophy
[20:09:11] <jdevel> I just thought that it was always faster/better to use a selector in jquery father than multi finds..
[20:09:29] <cgsawtell> not if the first part of the code works ;)
[20:09:32] <imsky> jdevel: you'd be wrong. i think ajpiano or coldhead and i found this out
[20:09:42] <imsky> cgsawtell: ok so just one
[20:09:46] <abjorn> Fun fact, jdevel, $("#parent").find("#child") is faster than $("#parent #child")
[20:09:51] <imsky> yes
[20:09:58] <jdevel> interesting
[20:10:02] <abjorn> quite a bit so actually
[20:10:11] <jdevel> I guess because of the bloat in the selector code?
[20:10:14] <imsky> if i rc, 69% or so speedup
[20:10:18] <cgsawtell> imsky: yep
[20:10:23] <abjorn> yeah there's like a shit ton of tests on jsperf comparing different selection methods in jquery n such
[20:10:32] <Z3R0_> wow so basically I was kinda right, but didn't know i was right?
[20:10:37] <abjorn> lol
[20:10:40] <imsky> you're thinking like a PC
[20:10:42] <imsky> not like a mac
[20:10:46] <imsky> who's scared of multiple .finds
[20:10:56] <jdevel> i don't care about multi finds.
[20:10:56] <imsky> though i shouldn't talk shit, since jeresig is all on that macbook train
[20:10:57] <abjorn> aint nuttin wrong with a .find
[20:11:04] <abjorn> lol
[20:11:05] <jdevel> just less keystroke my way
[20:11:15] <Z3R0_> very true
[20:11:20] <cgsawtell> I've got a macbook <.<
[20:11:24] <Z3R0_> ctrl+c / ctrl+v ^_^ ftw?
[20:11:25] <abjorn> of course he is, you and me are like two of the 5 non-mac using web developers, imsky
[20:11:27] <abjorn> REPRESEEENT
[20:11:33] <imsky> REPRAZENT
[20:11:35] <imsky> WIGGLA NATION
[20:11:40] * abjorn wigglaz
[20:11:45] <Z3R0_> I'm not using mac lol
[20:11:45] * imsky wigglorse
[20:12:15] <abjorn> welcome to the club, Z3R0_
[20:12:21] <abjorn> it's the best club of all
[20:12:21] <Z3R0_> woot
[20:12:27] <Z3R0_> all six of us... lol
[20:12:33] <abjorn> it's the club that saves themselves about $1000
[20:12:38] <jdevel> I like this chat, pick up a lot about jquery fast.
[20:12:38] <Z3R0_> ya think ?
[20:12:41] <jdevel> like a crash course
[20:12:54] <Z3R0_> yes jdevel, most definitely, although I swear I've talked to you somewhere's before
[20:13:01] <jdevel> yea, probably
[20:13:09] <Z3R0_> probably here
[20:13:12] <jdevel> I code in a lot of languages and platforms
[20:13:22] <jdevel> no, first time here
[20:13:24] <Z3R0_> or maybe it was in uh one of the framework rooms
[20:13:35] <abjorn> ##javascript
[20:13:38] <abjorn> jaboscript
[20:13:45] <abjorn>  /join ##jaboscript
[20:13:51] <jdevel> certainly have been in javascript
[20:14:18] <jdevel> can C, C#, AirCrack, lots of security stuff for iptables etc.
[20:14:28] <imsky> :odd doesn't work, omg
[20:14:44] <imsky> how dare you jquery you piece of crap
[20:14:58] <abjorn> I should make something like coffeescript, imsky, called jaboscript. Except it's not any different from JavaScript. Just the name.
[20:15:08] <abjorn> in fact, i just did
[20:15:09] <abjorn> done.
[20:15:10] <imsky> just rename narcissus
[20:15:13] <imsky> to jaboscript
[20:15:19] <abjorn> yes
[20:15:27] <abjorn> brb making wikipedia entry
[20:15:34] <imsky> you're the man now dog
[20:15:58] <jdevel> waiting for some tea from my wife.. she asked if I wanted some and vanished now
[20:16:06] <abjorn> I don't even know how to make a wikipedia page
[20:16:14] <Z3R0_> lol
[20:17:02] <jdevel> I wrote this credit application then damn thing is 2000 lines of code
[20:18:12] <Eviltwin> Anyone have any thoughts on: http://jsfiddle.net/JVpGU/
[20:18:31] <abjorn> fuck why is it so complicated to make a wikipedia article
[20:18:51] <imsky> lol
[20:18:52] <Myra> I'm the sassmaster.
[20:19:03] <imsky> cgsawtell: i'm getting a little lost in all you're trying to do
[20:19:03] <jdevel> $("<br>")  <-- does this create this element?
[20:19:08] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:19:08] <imsky> only in your mind
[20:19:15] <jdevel> your also not xhtml compliant there
[20:19:15] <abjorn> "create" yes
[20:19:18] <abjorn> "insert in the dom" no
[20:19:26] <cgsawtell> imsky:  did you look at the page?
[20:19:29] <Eviltwin> Hence the reason it's inside .append
[20:19:37] <imsky> cgsawtell: did you? shit looks disastrous lol
[20:19:41] <abjorn> course, eviltwin
[20:20:11] <cgsawtell> â€¦ thanks man I worked hard on that
[20:20:31] <abjorn> wow eviltwin that is like
[20:20:31] <imsky> lol look at it
[20:20:32] <imsky> it's all
[20:20:35] <imsky> cascading
[20:20:35] <abjorn> thats like a lot of appending
[20:20:53] <Eviltwin> abjorn: It's creating an entire form
[20:20:57] <abjorn> maybe you should just use like micro-templates or something
[20:21:01] <imsky> doT
[20:21:07] <cgsawtell> imsky: I'm a student bro you don't have to be a dick about it
[20:21:17] <imsky> hey relax broseph
[20:21:33] <Eviltwin> abjorn: It's really an illustration of a problem I'm having
[20:21:41] <cgsawtell> ok
[20:21:49] <cgsawtell> what's wrong with it?
[20:21:52] <Eviltwin> My situation's actually less involved but I want people to be forced to think about it the way I want them to
[20:21:58] <abjorn> If it is, Eviltwin, then micro-templates would really be your best friend there
[20:22:12] <cgsawtell> I might as well learn
[20:22:19] <jdevel> so in jquery $('<opening element>'); creates that element. so if I did var mydiv = $('<div>'); will be a div element?
[20:22:23] <Eviltwin> abjorn: How do you mean?
[20:22:34] <Eviltwin> abjorn: I need to add hooks on particular elements
[20:22:46] <Eviltwin> This structure gives me the opportunity to interact with each element as it's created
[20:22:55] <Z3R0_> what is $.map() ?
[20:22:57] <abjorn> If part of your problem involves so much HTML generation and appending, then I'd personally use micro-templates just so I don't get lost in it all
[20:23:02] <fris> will bind keypress work for mobile phones?
[20:23:03] <Eviltwin> ? jQuery.map
[20:23:03] <bot-t> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or array-like object to another array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[20:23:12] <Eviltwin> abjorn: Example?
[20:23:12] <Z3R0_> hmmm intersting
[20:23:29] <abjorn> ?tmpl
[20:23:30] <bot-t> abjorn, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[20:23:43] <imsky> cgsawtell: $('p',this).toggleClass('nestselected'); are you toggling all P's and what is "this?"
[20:24:14] <Eviltwin> abjorn: But what about getting handles to all of those for adding handles
[20:24:38] <Eviltwin> Also, multiple layers of dynamics inside each other
[20:24:39] <abjorn> You'd do that the same way you would attach events to an existing element
[20:25:12] <cgsawtell> is the a tag that encapsulates the p tag
[20:25:28] <imsky> wait there's an A tag encapsulating a P tag?
[20:25:28] <abjorn> var elem = $("#template").tmpl(data);
[20:25:28] <abjorn> elem.find(".something").click(function (event) { /* do stuff */ });
[20:25:42] <imsky> abjorn: jquery templates are dogshit slow
[20:25:48] <imsky> doT pl0x
[20:25:53] <abjorn> I'm just using tmpl as an example
[20:26:04] <cgsawtell> imsky: yes that is what the plugin that I'm using uses
[20:26:19] <fabiobik> hello
[20:26:21] <imsky> cgsawtell: that plugin writer doesn't understand standards, apparently
[20:26:29] <cgsawtell> clearly
[20:26:41] <cgsawtell> btw what is wrong with cascading?
[20:26:41] <fabiobik> how to refresh entire page without reload ?
[20:26:53] <imsky> cgsawtell: you mean what's wrong with this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453825/magpie-posthandin/help.html
[20:26:59] <imsky> is this the way you MEANT it to look?
[20:27:04] <abjorn> why would you need to, fabiobik
[20:27:08] <abjorn> i mean
[20:27:13] <abjorn> you could use ajax
[20:27:14] <imsky> he's asking about ajax
[20:27:19] <imsky> legit mates
[20:27:21] <abjorn> but to refresh a WHOLE page with ajax
[20:27:31] <imsky> why you'd have to be
[20:27:33] <abjorn> probs be kinda overkill
[20:27:34] <imsky> a fiendishly evil dick
[20:27:37] <fabiobik> abjorn  let me show you
[20:27:47] <cgsawtell> lol fuck that's not what it's meant to look like
[20:27:54] <imsky> "don't be a dick"
[20:28:00] <imsky> :(
[20:28:05] <fabiobik> abjorn http://programais.com/labs/php/galo/game.php?new=17a16e5213da197accadfafdd6da4a6a
[20:28:20] <cgsawtell> I think I'm missing a style sheet
[20:28:28] <courpse> Just as a learning thing, would this work? $.get('http://example.com', function(data) { body.html(data) });
[20:28:29] <cgsawtell> imsky: I take that back
[20:28:32] <fabiobik> abjorn click on table
[20:28:53] <abjorn> doesn't do anything
[20:29:05] <fabiobik> abjorn thats it
[20:29:17] <fabiobik> im reloading the table with load()
[20:29:19] <imsky> cgsawtell: also i can't find the pastebinned js on that page
[20:29:44] <fabiobik> abjorn im reloading the table with load()
[20:29:55] <cgsawtell> it's not on the page it's in a separate script
[20:29:57] <abjorn> word up
[20:30:11] <abjorn> yeah i mean you can use ajax for that
[20:31:08] <tktiddle> anyone seen any UI libraries for doing touch screen stuff?
[20:31:19] <imsky> abjorn: holy crap did you know that apple's new ceo is gay?
[20:31:25] <imsky> what is it with these guys
[20:31:31] <imsky> first peter thiel and now tim cook
[20:31:46] <Eviltwin> courpse: The problem is that even if you replace the HTML, there can still be things in JavaScript scope from before
[20:32:24] <courpse> Ahhh right.
[20:32:29] <abjorn> lol imsky
[20:32:56] <imsky> ye ye
[20:33:01] <imsky> just rifling through my rss
[20:33:16] <imsky> abjorn: http://padolsey.net/p/Sonic/repo/demo/demo.html
[20:33:35] <cgsawtell> imsky: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453825/Site2/pages/help.html this look a bit better?
[20:33:42] <imsky> ok i think we can safely say the internet's going to get much more sweet-looking in the next few years
[20:33:56] <imsky> cgsawtell: yeah that looks like it works
[20:34:22] <cgsawtell> imsky: sorry for the attitude I thought you were ripping on my design
[20:34:33] <imsky> typical designer
[20:34:40] <imsky> taking everything personally :P
[20:35:33] <cgsawtell> heh I'll have to work on that, and check my shit before linking :)
[20:35:42] <imsky> cgsawtell: that is so much better as a visual aid, holy cra
[20:35:43] <imsky> p
[20:36:03] <imsky> i understand the problem so clearly like a thousand diamonds
[20:36:07] <abjorn> another social networking site cgsawtell?
[20:36:17] <cgsawtell> abjorn: uni assignment
[20:36:22] <abjorn> ahh
[20:36:22] <imsky> abjorn: did you see those damn preloaders?
[20:36:28] <abjorn> yea, badass
[20:36:30] <imsky> holy crap!
[20:36:36] <imsky> thank god all that shit is coming back
[20:36:43] <imsky> when i left flash 4 years ago i was like "fuck"
[20:36:48] <imsky> but now it's like aaayyyyyy
[20:37:28] <cgsawtell> now we get to make pretty loading pages again ^.^
[20:37:32] <imsky> yesss
[20:37:43] <imsky> the tyranny of adobe is ova
[20:38:03] <abjorn> well actually...
[20:38:08] <imsky> shaddup
[20:38:10] <abjorn> adobe *is* working on that one tool
[20:38:13] <imsky> edge sux
[20:38:15] <abjorn> that is like flash for html5
[20:38:20] <imsky> no wai bro
[20:38:34] <abjorn> idk i think its too early to tell
[20:38:40] <imsky> it's not too early to tell
[20:38:41] <imsky> $600
[20:38:41] <abjorn> cause its clearly nowhere near workable
[20:38:43] <cgsawtell> why did they go for the after effects interface to clone that's what I want to know
[20:38:44] <abjorn> oh
[20:38:44] <abjorn> true
[20:38:46] <imsky> there, i just told you
[20:38:46] <abjorn> yeah fuck that
[20:38:56] <imsky> cgsawtell: because adobe is not macromedia
[20:38:59] <imsky> macromedia = innovative
[20:39:01] <abjorn> ill just wait for the gimp equivalent of it
[20:39:02] <imsky> adobe = 20 years on 1 product
[20:39:16] <cgsawtell> haha true
[20:39:22] <imsky> they killed freehand, too
[20:39:29] <imsky> illustrator is just retarded by comparison
[20:39:38] <cgsawtell> but I liked what adobe was doing with flash's ui
[20:39:42] <imsky> no way bro
[20:39:53] <imsky> all that gray nonsense
[20:39:59] <cgsawtell> I learnt on illustrator so I'm used to it
[20:40:00] <abjorn> i like how in your mockup, cgsawtell, Mary-Louise Parker and Neil Patrick Harris are under Chat
[20:40:24] <imsky> cgsawtell: http://www.pxleyes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/flash5.png
[20:40:29] <imsky> this is the canonical UI
[20:40:36] <cgsawtell> abjorn: thanks I just nabbed random names from imdb ;)
[20:41:08] <abjorn> i'd wiggle mary-louise parker
[20:41:13] <imsky> wiggla hard

[20:42:58] <imsky> cgsawtell: i'm not gonna get into oldtimer wars, but i started with flash 2, when it was released
[20:43:13] <imsky> MY LIFE FOR MACROMEDIA
[20:43:15] <abjorn> not anything good, but i was devving none the less

[20:45:42] <imsky> sir pl0x i need it in 5 mins
[20:45:49] <abjorn> we actually use pidgin at work internally, for messaging around the company
[20:45:52] <abjorn> XMPP
[20:45:55] <imsky> sweet
[20:45:55] <imsky> me 2
[20:45:57] <imsky> add me bro
[20:46:06] <imsky> i'm imsky@hostgator.com
[20:46:10] <abjorn> the actual support chat is proprietary tho obv
[20:46:13] <abjorn> lol rite
[20:46:40] <abjorn> i really should try and fix our chat systems IE9 bug
[20:46:44] <abjorn> since our dumbass developers cant
[20:46:45] <abjorn> apparently
[20:47:06] <abjorn> our chat system has a nasty little  bug on the client end in IE9 where messages are repeated like 204398234 times
[20:47:20] <imsky> cgsawtell: wait if i understand correctly
[20:47:35] <imsky> wait wat
[20:47:38] <imsky> why are you even using nestfilter
[20:47:52] <cgsawtell> I'm not sure...
[20:47:54] <imsky> oh right shit, the dumbass plugin author
[20:48:05] <imsky> he's basically making you do extra work you could do in css natively
[20:48:25] <cgsawtell> probably newbie going overboard on css but I think at one stage it was a bigger for than the body copy..
[20:48:38] <imsky> here's a zen secret for css
[20:48:46] <imsky> the more you can do with fewer lines
[20:48:51] <imsky> the more of a badass you are
[20:48:55] <abjorn> https://chat.hostgator.com/js/in_chat.js man do our developers not know how to fucking comment code
[20:49:09] <imsky> you shouldn't go near my code
[20:49:10] <cgsawtell> haha alright thanks :)
[20:49:22] <imsky> current project is about 20kloc of js, abjorn
[20:49:23] <cgsawtell> it got a little crazy as the site developed
[20:49:35] <imsky> when i read it i'm like "who wrote this wat"
[20:49:41] <cgsawtell> so many rules and so little time
[20:49:48] <imsky> cgsawtell: yeah
[20:50:36] <cgsawtell> also I didn't know how to do #bla p {} untill halfway though
[20:50:47] <abjorn> o.O huh. looking at this code for our chat system...they send the *entire* chat in every ajax response to update
[20:51:03] <imsky> cgsawtell: would you be a real bro and zip up the site so i can test the code on my end?
[20:51:10] <imsky> abjorn: almost as efficient as XMPP
[20:51:14] <imsky> lolol presence data for lyf
[20:51:45] <cgsawtell> sure man,
[20:52:07] <abjorn> @imsky: Of course, that begs the question: "So then why is it repeating lines *only* in IE9?"
[20:52:08] <imsky> is this for a web design course
[20:52:21] <abjorn> also mfw they use new Array();
[20:52:21] <imsky> abjorn: microsoft is for the win
[20:52:24] <imsky> lolol
[20:52:32] <imsky> are your programmers
[20:52:35] <imsky> of a certain ethnicity
[20:52:38] <cgsawtell> btw is dropbox fucked on lion for anyone else?
[20:52:40] <imsky> that's always 5 years behind the times
[20:52:40] <abjorn> they're perl programmers >.>
[20:52:48] <imsky> lol :(
[20:53:01] <imsky> cgsawtell: macs always work bro lolol
[20:53:02] <abjorn> I'm like 99% sure no one at this company knows how to code JavaScript well.
[20:53:17] <imsky> harshe words
[20:53:28] <cgsawtell> imsky: 98% of the time they work ;)
[20:53:34] <imsky> lol
[20:53:40] <imsky> how do you like mission control
[20:53:43] <cgsawtell> mine decided to drop it's colour profile during handins :'(
[20:53:57] <abjorn> mfw they don't filter their for in loops
[20:53:59] <cgsawtell> meh, it's ok
[20:54:05] <imsky> hmm
[20:54:14] <abjorn> I mean, this JavaScript isn't TERRIBLE but come on
[20:54:25] <imsky> i like this if (++receive_num % 5 == 0 || typing)
[20:54:30] <imsky> WAT
[20:54:30] <abjorn> rofl
[20:54:35] <abjorn> wwhere is that
[20:54:35] <abjorn> what
[20:54:36] <imsky> and no curly brace, note
[20:54:36] <abjorn> lmfao
[20:54:45] <abjorn> yeah these guys don't like curly braces
[20:54:45] <imsky> crockford would shit all over this
[20:54:46] <abjorn> apparently
[20:54:49] <abjorn> he really would
[20:54:52] <abjorn> i ran it in jslint in fact
[20:54:53] <abjorn> and lol'd
[20:54:58] <imsky> lolol
[20:55:15] <abjorn> it's hard to debug this shit without like
[20:55:17] <abjorn> a debug setup
[20:55:18] <abjorn> to test
[20:55:26] <deqer> how do i properly chain my code so i can execute cm_validate_form() after the previous function?  http://jsfiddle.net/EKpzE/
[20:55:46] <deqer> because the form is being pulled through ajax.  but i removed all that for this test-case.
[20:55:51] <cgsawtell> imsky: it's uploading now
[20:55:58] <imsky> abjorn: components[j] = components[j].replace(/\[%pipe%]/g, "|");
[20:55:59] <imsky> wat
[20:56:07] <cgsawtell> at a snails paceâ€¦.
[20:56:09] <abjorn> god i just
[20:56:13] <abjorn> I don't fucking know
[20:56:15] <cgsawtell> 2kb wtf
[20:56:25] <imsky> why do they send [%pipe%] over the net?
[20:56:32] <abjorn> because they're retarded?
[20:56:36] <imsky> why do they send 8x the bytes necessary
[20:56:47] <deqer> anyone?
[20:56:55] <abjorn> read: because they're retarded
[20:57:01] <imsky> abjorn: $('#rate_exit').click(function() {$(window).unload();});
[20:57:08] <imsky> window...un...load?
[20:57:11] <abjorn> un...unload
[20:57:11] <abjorn> what
[20:57:11] <imsky> is this in a popup?
[20:57:16] <abjorn> oh
[20:57:17] <abjorn> yeah
[20:57:25] <imsky> :(
[20:57:40] <abjorn> clicking the chat link on hostgator.com brings up a small window
[20:57:43] <abjorn> well, smallish
[20:57:43] <imsky> cgsawtell: you can use http://minus.com
[20:57:52] <imsky> it's super fast
[20:58:00] <deqer> this is a support channel, right?
[20:58:04] <imsky> it might be
[20:58:11] <cgsawtell> oh sweet
[20:58:12] <imsky> abjorn: if (mids[i] == 9999999999)
[20:58:26] <cgsawtell> it's done now but that's for the site
[20:58:41] <abjorn> something like that, deqer
[20:58:59] <cgsawtell> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453825/Site2.zip
[20:58:59] <deqer> well, wtf you birds chirping about.  cant you take a look at my paste?
[20:59:02] <imsky> so i was pretty cool with 9999999998 items in mids
[20:59:07] <imsky> but i needed one more
[20:59:13] <imsky> you know
[20:59:13] <abjorn> then it broke
[20:59:26] <abjorn> these names are stupid, idk wtf mids is supposed to be
[20:59:32] <imsky> mid-grade weed
[20:59:37] <ngharo> deqer: is $.colorbox async?
[20:59:44] <abjorn> ugh why are they using setInterval
[20:59:50] <imsky> because they can
[20:59:51] <abjorn> no.
[20:59:52] <abjorn> fucking.
[20:59:53] <abjorn> wonder.
[20:59:57] <abjorn> I bet you
[20:59:59] <abjorn> that's what's doing it
[21:00:05] <imsky> ?
[21:00:10] <imsky> oh, extra looping?
[21:00:13] <imsky> on the timer
[21:00:13] <abjorn> yep
[21:00:14] <deqer> ngharo, yes, it's run within success: function(){} of $.ajax post
[21:00:21] <imsky> lol
[21:00:27] <abjorn> it asks for an update before it's done processing
[21:00:31] <abjorn> because setInterval
[21:00:37] <sgrover> Easy question (I hope).  I need to setup my JS environment (script tags and such) via JS.  Is the $.getScript() the best way to do this?
[21:00:46] <imsky> cgsawtell: how do i get to help.html
[21:00:54] <imsky> never mind
[21:00:57] <imsky> lol
[21:01:02] <cgsawtell> site/pages/help.html
[21:01:25] <ngharo> deqer: ok im looking at the docs.  Call your init function in colorbox onComplete callback
[21:01:48] <deqer> oh
[21:01:57] <abjorn> $10 says I fix our IE9 bug which has been a major problem, and I don't get any recognition for it
[21:02:04] <abjorn> or that dev promotion I've been looking for
[21:02:27] <sgrover> abjorn: just be very vocal about completing the fix.... :)
[21:02:32] <deqer> you're right ngharo.  im sorry.  i have http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/ right infront of me and i actually remember reading onComplete.  not sure why i didn't think of trying that.
[21:02:43] <imsky> abjorn: i'll give you $0.10
[21:02:47] <imsky> odds are 1 to 100
[21:02:49] <abjorn> lol
[21:03:03] <imsky> actually
[21:03:06] <imsky> you should fix the bug
[21:03:11] <deqer> ngharo, thx.  appreciate it.
[21:03:11] <imsky> and then add another interval
[21:03:15] <ngharo> deqer: np
[21:03:16] <imsky> that inserts a message from the "customer"
[21:03:22] <imsky> that says "you know corey? he fixed your shit"
[21:03:28] <imsky> "you dumbass"
[21:03:32] <imsky> "you're about to get fired"
[21:03:39] <cgsawtell> I like that idea
[21:03:48] <abjorn> shitty part is, they asked for any javascript gurus if they could help
[21:03:50] <abjorn> so i was
[21:03:51] <abjorn> "yeah sure"
[21:04:03] <imsky> in that case, just insert zalgo at random
[21:04:03] <abjorn> QA lead who asked tells me to go talk to the dev working on it
[21:04:07] <abjorn> he treats me like i dont know shit
[21:04:11] <abjorn> high and mighty perl programmer
[21:04:16] <imsky> lol because you're on the low end of 2*
[21:04:29] <ngharo> sounds like a shit job
[21:04:31] <imsky> he's likely 4*
[21:04:56] <abjorn> I know so many chat techs here that are ridiculously knowledgeable and skilled
[21:05:00] <abjorn> more so than a lot of our devs
[21:05:32] <abjorn> I mean, it's really not a shit job, ngharo
[21:05:42] <abjorn> I actually am pretty glad for this job, it's a good job
[21:05:47] <imsky> cgsawtell: so wait, should the current .nestselected have .nestfilter added to it once it's deselected?
[21:05:58] <cgsawtell> yep
[21:06:01] <imsky> ok one sec
[21:07:03] <imsky> this is easily fixed with html BUT WHATEVER
[21:07:19] <abjorn> lol the first thing I asked the dev, imsky, was if there was any dev code i could look at. And he was like "It's JavaScript. It's public."
[21:07:26] <abjorn> Forgive me for thinking they'd actually fucking minify their code
[21:07:34] <imsky> cgsawtell: got it all in one line
[21:07:37] <imsky> cgsawtell: $(this).parents("#nestscontainer").find(".nestselected").addClass("nestfilter").removeClass("nestselected").end().end().find("p").addClass("nestselected");
[21:07:55] <ngharo> sgrover: getScript kinda sucks if you need to debug in the browser.  I'd just append <script> tags to head
[21:08:02] <imsky> cgsawtell: http://pastie.org/2431629
[21:08:09] <cgsawtell> imsky: nice thanks man :D
[21:08:14] <imsky> abjorn: lol so no build process?
[21:08:26] <abjorn> nope
[21:08:29] <sgrover> ngharo: thanks.  I'll have to poll though to determine when it is loaded right?
[21:08:30] <imsky> JOY
[21:08:33] <abjorn> and after that he assumed i must not know anything about javascript
[21:08:38] <abjorn> so i was like
[21:08:39] <cgsawtell> jquery is cool but it's not really like any other programming I've done before
[21:08:43] <abjorn> "well fuck this, i dont care if it doesnt work"
[21:08:44] <imsky> i think these bros think programming == perl
[21:08:56] <imsky> cgsawtell: javascript pros would say the same thing
[21:08:57] <abjorn> perl looks like minified, obfuscated code to me
[21:09:00] <ngharo> sgrover: you should be able to catch the load event
[21:09:39] <sgrover> abjorn: it's called tunnel vision.  Every dev thinks their language is the "best"...  But it might only be best cuz it's what they know and happens to work for their particular case.
[21:09:46] <sgrover> ngharo: thanks again.
[21:09:49] <abjorn> yeah basically
[21:10:20] <imsky> i like how with .end() you can essentially write one line of jquery
[21:10:22] <imsky> forever
[21:10:32] <abjorn> rofl
[21:10:45] <abjorn> sup snover
[21:10:55] <cgsawtell> imsky: thanks for that bro :)
[21:11:00] <imsky> np man
[21:11:29] <cgsawtell> sorry for linking you the wrong page at first I can see why you where thinking wtf
[21:12:48] <imsky> it's all good
[21:12:54] <imsky> abjorn: do you use s3 at all?
[21:13:04] <abjorn> nope
[21:13:19] <imsky> all right
[21:13:26] <imsky> message received brojeph
[21:13:35] <abjorn> never really done anythign that called for it
[21:13:36] <abjorn> looks neato tho
[21:13:46] <imsky> yeah they now have s3 static file...hosting
[21:13:47] <imsky> server
[21:13:49] <imsky> ...thing
[21:13:58] <imsky> the new hip thing is to use jekyll and just do that
[21:15:02] <imsky> http://openfoo.org/blog/jekyll-s3.html
[21:15:04] <abjorn> holy crap, this code really is doing a whole hell of lot inside a 1 second setInterval lol
[21:15:10] <imsky> lololol
[21:15:11] <abjorn> it's a wonder this bug doesn't happen elsewhere
[21:16:31] * tash knightrider
[21:16:34] <tash> hmm
[21:16:35] <abjorn> that is actually kinda weird that it only happens in IE9
[21:16:46] <abjorn> I guess IE9 is especially slow with something in that function
[21:16:59] <imsky> we don't...use setinterval anymore
[21:17:01] <imsky> it's dead to us
[21:17:10] <abjorn> well duh
[21:17:55] <ngharo> you do all the time in jquery :)
[21:18:01] <imsky> hmm
[21:18:07] <imsky> only for .ready amirite
[21:18:15] <ngharo> animations
[21:18:21] <imsky> oh yeah
[21:18:24] <imsky> didn't think of that
[21:18:26] <abjorn> yeah that
[21:18:35] <abjorn> I mean, setInterval has it'
[21:18:37] <abjorn> s uses
[21:18:45] <abjorn> It's just in the everyday case it shouldn't be used is all
[21:18:52] <abjorn> read: almost all cases
[21:19:04] <imsky> except by trained professionals
[21:19:15] <abjorn> that's what they said about eval
[21:19:24] <imsky> hey did you notice
[21:19:31] <imsky> how crockford's JSON.js is mysteriously gone
[21:19:37] <imsky> what's up with that
[21:19:42] <abjorn> whatchya mean
[21:19:59] <imsky> i guess it's on github
[21:20:02] <imsky> but you can't find it on the site
[21:20:03] <abjorn> oh, yeah
[21:20:08] <abjorn> he changed where it is
[21:20:14] <imsky> never told nobody!
[21:20:16] <abjorn> the link on the home page goes to his github now
[21:20:20] <abjorn> how would he?
[21:20:26] <tash> so, i'm not really a js guy (or jQ), but I'm learning. Looking at this, http://pastie.org/2431657 , you can see that I return false on a few things ... But, if I fix a username in my form so that it isn't taken, my form won't submit.  Is it b/c I'm returning false and it doesn't reset or something? Sorry, confused.
[21:20:31] <imsky> the current json.js just says, alert("Error")
[21:20:36] <abjorn> lol yeah
[21:20:37] <imsky> i kid you not, let me see if i can find it
[21:20:40] <abjorn> i know
[21:20:40] <abjorn> i saw
[21:20:44] <imsky> http://www.json.org/json2.js
[21:20:45] <imsky> wtf
[21:20:49] <imsky> thanks crockford
[21:20:54] <abjorn> yeeepp
[21:20:59] <imsky> he even put in a REDIRECT
[21:21:04] <imsky> from JSON.js to the alert
[21:21:13] <abjorn> really? lol
[21:21:14] <imsky> but not to motherfucking github
[21:21:30] <imsky> wat a troll
[21:22:06] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.ideone.com/
[21:22:26] <imsky> hnggg, amirite
[21:22:55] <abjorn> god how many of those are people gonna make
[21:23:05] <abjorn> there was already codepad ages ago
[21:23:07] <imsky> this one does freaking fortran
[21:23:10] <imsky> yeah but codepad is one thing
[21:23:14] <abjorn> no its not
[21:23:23] <imsky> does it do...F#?
[21:23:26] <abjorn> i mean it doesnt do fortran
[21:23:27] <abjorn> but i mean
[21:23:31] <abjorn> who wants to use fortran
[21:23:38] <abjorn> im just saying
[21:23:39] <imsky> bro, benchmarks
[21:23:46] <abjorn> why not help codepad make it support more languages
[21:23:47] <imsky> and there's freaking SQL
[21:23:48] <abjorn> instead of
[21:23:53] <abjorn> making a new one
[21:23:56] <ngharo> tash: can you show us a "working" demo?
[21:24:13] <cylence> Is it possible to access a cookie for, say, store.domain.com from www.domain.com?
[21:24:15] <cylence> using the jquery.cookies.js lib
[21:24:19] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.ideone.com/recent
[21:24:27] <imsky> lol at the compilation/runtime errors
[21:24:34] <Corey> imsky: I fix everyone's shit. :-)
[21:24:40] <abjorn> woah
[21:24:40] <imsky> woa
[21:24:40] <abjorn> WOAH
[21:24:43] <abjorn> don't steal my name
[21:24:45] <imsky> woa
[21:24:49] <imsky> who the hell is Corey
[21:24:54] <abjorn> I'm Corey!
[21:24:57] <imsky> no
[21:24:58] <abjorn> But
[21:24:58] <imsky> who's this guy
[21:24:59] <abjorn> so is he!
[21:25:02] <imsky> i don't see nick changes
[21:25:09] <Corey> imsky: The funny part is that I'm on the infra team. :-)
[21:25:16] <Corey> (For jQuery)
[21:25:19] <imsky> oh
[21:25:22] <Corey> And I haven't changed my nick in ages.
[21:25:22] <imsky> wait wat
[21:25:27] <rer> cylence: that depends on the domain of the cookie
[21:25:28] <imsky> why are you piping up
[21:25:31] <imsky> all of a sudden
[21:25:37] <cylence> rer: the cookie is set to store.domain.com
[21:25:38] <Corey> imsky: You hilighted me.
[21:25:41] <Corey> 21:03:22 #jquery: < imsky> that says "you know corey? he fixed your shit"
[21:25:44] <imsky> oh
[21:25:46] <Corey> I generally do.
[21:25:48] <Corey> :-)
[21:25:52] <imsky> oh yeah bro congrats
[21:25:59] <imsky> abjorn: lol
[21:26:01] <Corey> *fistbump*
[21:26:05] <cylence> rer: is there no way to access it from the root domain or other subdomains?
[21:26:05] <rer> cylence:  Then I don't think so.
[21:26:11] <cylence> oh noes :/
[21:26:12] * imsky bumps Corey
[21:26:18] <abjorn> god im getting confused
[21:26:20] <tash> ngharo: right now it's not public, sorry
[21:26:21] <imsky> lol
[21:26:23] <imsky> just let it flow
[21:26:26] * Corey goes back to lurking
[21:26:26] <tash> would have to do some firewall crap
[21:26:29] <cylence> rer: thanks for the help
[21:26:39] <imsky> abjorn: welcome to C, fucker:  long long int a,k,t,i;
[21:26:46] <imsky> LONG LONG INT
[21:26:52] <rer> cylence: if the cooke domain was .domain.com I think you could access it.
[21:26:54] <imsky> http://www.ideone.com/EHpsd,YkVTj
[21:27:04] <abjorn> long long int wtf lol
[21:27:07] <imsky> lolol
[21:27:10] <ngharo> tash: when is the feedback written to the page?  Typically you'd display feedback inside your submit handler...
[21:27:11] <imsky> i love c
[21:27:25] <abjorn> I see no point in using long
[21:27:28] <abjorn> let alone
[21:27:29] <abjorn> ...
[21:27:31] <abjorn> long long int
[21:27:31] <imsky> better than FLOAT
[21:27:35] <imsky> rororlr
[21:27:45] <ngharo> tash: i'm guessing you're not clearing the feedback upon legit username or whatever and the condition never returns true
[21:27:50] <imsky> abjorn: for(i=0;i<n;i++)
[21:27:50] <imsky> for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
[21:27:52] <tash> ngharo: the feedback is written on keyup() ... so as soon as someone types a username (or phone) that isn't unique, I write it to the page
[21:27:59] <abjorn> if you're worried about how many fuckin bytes your variable uses, use the explicit byte types
[21:28:00] <imsky> abjorn: do you see the problem
[21:28:01] <tash> it is clearing actually, using fade
[21:28:11] <abjorn> rofl imsky
[21:28:13] <tash> fadeOut I mean
[21:28:13] <imsky> and yet the code is a smashing success
[21:28:18] <imsky> http://www.ideone.com/B7Exn,bPHmI
[21:28:25] <tash> hmmm
[21:28:26] <ngharo> tash: fade doesnt actually clear the value.  it simples sets display: none
[21:28:27] <tash> I might be wrong
[21:28:29] <abjorn> smashing
[21:28:42] <imsky> wow i'm gonna be on this thing for a while
[21:28:45] <abjorn> rofl
[21:28:47] <abjorn> this has to be like
[21:28:48] <imsky> codepad just doesn't have that kitchen sink feel to it
[21:28:50] <abjorn> troll code
[21:28:53] <imsky> lolol
[21:29:00] <abjorn> there was perl code posted as c++ code
[21:29:04] <imsky> C code: printf("ï¼‘ï½žï¼“ã§å¥½ããªæ•°å­—ã‚’å…¥åŠ›ã—ã¦ãã ã•ã„\n");
[21:29:09] <imsky> what is this, ZALGO?
[21:29:15] <imsky> c doesn't do unicode, jeff
[21:29:16] <abjorn> lol utf-8 in c, you wish
[21:29:22] <imsky> asian jeff
[21:29:27] <abjorn> jeffu
[21:29:36] <imsky> oh hey cgsawtell
[21:29:42] <cgsawtell> yo
[21:29:46] <imsky> did you hear that through LDAP, you can log into Lion with any password?
[21:29:49] <imsky> i can hax ur box
[21:29:53] <imsky> if you give me your ip
[21:29:54] <imsky> and username
[21:29:55] <tash> ngharo: oh, not sure how to clear the val
[21:30:03] <cgsawtell> oh seriously?
[21:30:07] <imsky> yeah for sho
[21:30:13] <ngharo> tash: in the fadeOut callback do $(this).val('')
[21:30:17] <cgsawtell> is that fixed?
[21:30:21] <tash> oh, well that makes sense
[21:30:23] <tash> trying
[21:30:24] <imsky> check for updates, bro
[21:30:44] <imsky> abjorn: troll code is so philosophical
[21:30:49] <cgsawtell> there was an update released today, might install it tonight
[21:30:50] <imsky> it's like you're trolling mathematics itself
[21:30:50] <abjorn> also: lol OSX Security
[21:30:55] <abjorn> i.e. "What Security?"
[21:30:57] <cgsawtell> actually will install it tonight
[21:30:58] <imsky> lol
[21:31:01] <imsky> FREEBSD IS SECURE
[21:31:09] <abjorn> troll physics
[21:31:20] <imsky> abjorn: long long int a[1000000]={0};
[21:31:28] <imsky> all right then
[21:31:30] <abjorn> xD
[21:31:44] <cgsawtell> abjorn: did you get that bug fixed?
[21:31:48] <imsky> abjorn: this is F#, let myseq = seq{ yield [1..10] |> Seq.filter (fun x -> x%2 =0)}
[21:31:54] <imsky> pretty...great code
[21:31:57] <imsky> just to look at
[21:32:17] <abjorn> yeah no idea what thats doing
[21:32:22] <imsky> abjorn: long long int arr[1000010]={0};
[21:32:25] <imsky> i got a patch to that
[21:32:29] <imsky> long long int arrnet[1000010]={0};
[21:32:30] <abjorn> xD
[21:32:32] <tash> sighs, maybe that's not my problem, damn form isn't submitting even when I expect it to :P
[21:32:32] <imsky> ^
[21:32:33] <tash> it was earlier
[21:32:37] <tash> i'm calling it a night
[21:32:43] <imsky> long long intarrnet, gently down the streem
[21:32:53] <imsky> merrily merrily merrily merrily
[21:32:56] <imsky> lyf is but a dreem

[21:33:46] <imsky> full of the lies
[21:33:50] <abjorn> I suffer through the agony of non-existence
[21:34:21] <imsky> abjorn: hey JS fanboy: int *myarray = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
[21:34:33] <imsky> yeah that's what i did to your mother last night
[21:34:39] <imsky> manually allocated some memory
[21:34:50] <abjorn> that doesn't even work
[21:34:54] <abjorn> as innuendo
[21:35:02] <imsky> oh i thought you meant the code doesn't
[21:35:08] <imsky> because i think it does
[21:35:10] <abjorn> and jesus, if you're gonna be with my mom, at least use the new operator
[21:35:13] <imsky> lol

[21:38:09] <imsky> http://www.ideone.com/2Y1ns
[21:38:10] <abjorn> lets find out
[21:38:11] <abjorn> together
[21:38:16] <imsky> 215 MB of RAM holy crap
[21:38:19] <imsky> rhino you scary
[21:38:45] <abjorn> lol
[21:38:50] <imsky> oh shit let me pull out the big guns
[21:38:50] <abjorn> I doubt node is any better tho
[21:39:02] <imsky> :(){ :|:& };:
[21:39:02] <abjorn> in terms of ram
[21:39:04] <imsky> ^ c fork bomb
[21:39:08] <abjorn> lol
[21:39:55] <imsky> damn hold on
[21:39:57] <ngharo> looks like bash
[21:40:04] <imsky> not a c fork bomb
[21:40:05] <imsky> yeah bash
[21:40:21] <imsky> http://www.ideone.com/YRNPg
[21:40:26] <imsky> results are...uneventful
[21:40:33] <abjorn> lol
[21:40:51] <imsky> what i really wanna see
[21:40:54] <imsky> are anonymous shells
[21:41:41] <imsky> throw a vim/emacs/nano in there
[21:41:48] <ngharo> i think there are some... or were at least
[21:41:49] <imsky> and now everyone can write code and upload it from any browser
[21:42:41] <ngharo> they lock ya down there.  prolly can only spawn a few procs at a time
[21:42:52] <imsky> good old jail
[21:42:56] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/#what_looks
[21:43:09] <ngharo> altough you'll always find a misconfigured host/lazy admin
[21:43:21] <imsky> that's why joyent/rackspace should do it
[21:44:26] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.ideone.com/R5Qgs
[21:44:33] <imsky> php errored out only at 13MB
[21:44:37] <imsky> rhino is a heavy bastard
[21:45:21] <abjorn> lol imsky
[21:45:33] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.ideone.com/5hvlN
[21:45:37] <imsky> C is even more lean
[21:45:42] <imsky> though not surprising, since php is c
[21:46:18] <imsky> holy crap it's almost 1
[21:47:17] <co_dh> greeting, what is this select do in jQuery :  $("<select class=\"value\"></select>")
[21:47:28] <imsky> it does nothing, lebovski
[21:48:41] <co_dh> imsky: are you answering my question?
[21:48:46] <imsky> yes
[21:49:18] <co_dh> well, it did return something.
[21:49:45] <abjorn> rhino is c
[21:49:46] <abjorn> at least
[21:49:49] <abjorn> spidermonkey is written in c
[21:49:51] <abjorn> :)
[21:49:54] <abjorn> ...or is it c++?
[21:49:56] <abjorn> i think it's c
[21:49:57] <imsky> C
[21:50:00] <imsky> tracemonkey is c++
[21:50:03] <abjorn> yeah
[21:50:10] <ngharo> co_dh: indeed.  it returns the select wrapped in a jquery object
[21:50:16] <co_dh> it return an array , whose [0] is an HTMLSelectElement  ( from Chrome's debugger)
[21:50:52] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjh-nFCfp2s&feature=player_detailpage#t=76s
[21:51:03] <co_dh> ngharo: is it create a new one? or select an existing one?
[21:51:11] <ngharo> co_dh: new
[21:51:32] <co_dh> weird, where can I find some document about this?
[21:51:43] <ngharo> $("<select class=\"value\"></select>").appendTo('body'); would work for instance
[21:53:19] <co_dh> I got the document jQuery( html, [ownerDocument] )
[21:53:45] <co_dh> it's anti intuition, a selector should not create new object !
[21:53:54] <co_dh> anyway , thanks!
[21:54:52] <ngharo> huh
[21:55:01] <ngharo> <select .... /> is not a selector
[21:55:33] <Phrogz> ngharo: The magic of the $() function has many mysteries
[21:55:50] <ngharo> it makes sense to me
[21:56:36] <co_dh> well, I think the $ as a selector, but it turns out not, it's a Do It All function, called jQuery()
[21:57:01] <co_dh> at least, the document called it selector !
[21:57:20] <ngharo> the document states it can take html or a selector
[21:57:40] <ngharo> think of when passing a selector a helper function is called to fetch said selector's html and fills it in
[21:57:58] <ngharo> thats not really how it works but thinking of it that way kinda makes sense
[21:58:02] <imsky> you can't..select <div>
[21:58:09] <imsky> it doesn't exist in DOM
[21:58:12] <Phrogz> ...not really, but if it helps you, go for it.
[22:26:52] <cam_> hellooo
[22:27:45] <cam_> i have a question
[22:35:49] <bitwise_> hi- wondering if people use the history.js library (not jquery.history.js) and what their thoughts are
[22:36:23] <cam_> Hello friends
[22:36:29] <cam_> i have a question
[22:37:21] <cam_> http://jsfiddle.net/ezY36/
[22:37:34] <cam_> next() is giving me some problems
[22:38:05] <cam_> when i put a <br> after the link the next doesn't work
[22:39:09] <cam_> http://jsfiddle.net/ezY36/
[22:39:53] <cam_> when i put a <br> after the link, the next() doesn't work
[22:42:33] <cam_> http://jsfiddle.net/ezY36/
[22:42:48] <cam_> when i put a <br> after the link the next() doesn't work
[22:45:33] <cam_> somebody here?
[22:47:19] <cam_> ??
[22:48:30] <coldhead> ?nextuntil @ cam_
[22:48:31] <bot-t> cam_, .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[22:48:38] <coldhead> next gets the very next element
[22:48:42] <coldhead> which is br in your case
[22:48:43] <misterm> cam_: next gets the next element
[22:48:50] <coldhead> thanks misterm
[22:48:54] <coldhead> you got it from here :)
[22:49:19] <misterm> cam_: the selector option for next() only checks the next element, not finds the next element that matches it
[22:49:30] <cam_> ok, but i used with a selector
[22:49:38] <cam_> okay
[22:49:44] <cam_> now i understand
[22:50:31] <heshanh> hey guys is there way to finda specific tag in all the parent tags but stop after finding the first one? stop or even do an action on only the first tag
[22:51:19] <ryanseddon> closest?
[22:51:20] <misterm> coldhead: you're a gentleman and a scholar
[22:51:45] <heshanh> yep
[22:53:20] <heshanh> oh! closest, thats an actualy method i did not know that
[22:53:24] <heshanh> thank u heaps :)
[22:54:20] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[23:06:05] <ettinger> howdy
[23:06:20] <ettinger> How do I load a function onDomReady?
[23:13:45] <_|Nix|_> danheberden: I get undefined ... weird ... how can that be? I just defined it ...
[23:13:50] <_|Nix|_> Oops ... sorry ...
[23:19:10] <cam_> thi sis not working :(
[23:24:59] <cam_> I have a basic question
[23:28:21] <chrisboom> Hey guys. Any reason that all 3 links are making the div toggle - http://svnet.org/contact2
[23:30:53] <rajeshp> I'm looking for an expandable tree where every entry has a select box
[23:32:50] <cam_> chrisboom> What is the problem?
[23:33:17] <chrisboom> no worries, i was using a class for my selector. Changed it to an id instead and it worked
[23:33:38] <chrisboom> Why would that be? Has it always got to be a #?
[23:33:48] <chrisboom> I'll change it back and show you what was wrong
[23:34:01] <misterm> chrisboom: why would what be?
[23:34:34] <misterm> chrisboom: you use whatever you're trying to select for...if you need to get by ID you use the ID, if you need to get by class you use the class, etc
[23:35:13] <chrisboom> Ok, so I changed it back http://svnet.org/contact2
[23:35:28] <chrisboom> Clicking on any of the three links, or the visible div itself toggles the div
[23:35:44] <chrisboom> why, when I am selecting on the jQuery(".post").click(function () {
[23:35:52] <chrisboom> And there's only one .post item
[23:36:06] <misterm> chrisboom: which links and which div?
[23:36:21] <chrisboom> I would like to... x 3
[23:36:26] <misterm> chrisboom: and what is toggleing about the div?
[23:36:26] <chrisboom> clicking makes a div appear
[23:36:41] <chrisboom> it should just be I would like to receive a Profile Form by post. toggles it
[23:36:46] <chrisboom> thats the one with .post
[23:36:51] <chrisboom> as the class
[23:36:57] <chrisboom> but currently all three toggle it
[23:36:59] <misterm> nothing seems to happen when I click the link
[23:37:11] <chrisboom> refresh page? i just changed it
[23:37:40] <misterm> ah, ok I see it now
[23:38:09] <misterm> chrisboom: where is your code for that
[23:38:25] <chrisboom> bottom of the page
[23:38:26] <chrisboom> script
[23:38:31] <chrisboom> What I don't get is why that is happening, but if I change it to a # it works fine
[23:39:33] <misterm> chrisboom: well issue aside, if you're trying to pick one element in particular you probably want to use the id anyway
[23:39:53] <misterm> chrisboom: what happens if you log $(".post")?
[23:40:07] <chrisboom> sorry don't know what that means
[23:40:48] <misterm> chrisboom: console.log()
[23:42:09] <misterm> chrisboom: have you noticed that it's not just clicking the links that toggles it
[23:42:29] <misterm> chrisboom: what web browser are you using?
[23:43:15] <misterm> chrisboom: learn to use console.log() with whatever browser you use, google should help you with that
[23:43:35] <misterm> chrisboom: and then what you would do is to console.log( jQuery(".post") ) inside your click listener
[23:43:57] <misterm> chrisboom: and what you'll see in the console is that the jQuery object contains *2* elements
[23:44:21] <misterm> chrisboom: it contains all the elements on the page that have the class "post" because that's what you're selecting
[23:44:36] <misterm> chrisboom: one of them is the link, and the other is a DIV which holds all the links as well as that text
[23:45:04] <misterm> chrisboom: and both get a click listener attached which causes the form to toggle, you'll see that if you click anywhere in the div the form will toggle
[23:46:56] <chrisboom> but why does it toggle when clicking the links that dont have the class post
[23:47:03] <chrisboom> the div doesn't have the class post
[23:47:17] <chrisboom> it has the id postdiv
[23:48:55] <misterm> chrisboom: it has the class post, and the id "post-426"
[23:49:08] <misterm> chrisboom: if you log the object like I suggested you'll see
[23:49:43] <misterm> chrisboom: it's not toggling when you click those links, it's toggling when you click on any element inside the div that has the class "post"
[23:50:36] <misterm> those links are inside a div that has the class "post" and since you attach a listener to any element that has the class post they fire that listener, really clicking anywhere inside the div will fire it though
[23:51:17] <misterm> chrisboom: try clicking the paragraph above the links, that should fire it too
[23:51:23] <chrisboom> AHA
[23:51:41] <chrisboom> just realised that there's another div called class on the page i didn't know about!
[23:51:46] <chrisboom> now I understand
[23:51:48] <chrisboom> thanks!
[23:52:24] <misterm> chrisboom: np, do yourself a favor and learn how to use console.log() and the developer tools/firebug...it will make stuff like this much easier
[23:52:45] <chrisboom> i use the console in developer tools
[23:53:17] <chrisboom> I just couldn't see how it thought it was in div post - forgot wordpress automatically generates a div called post lol
[23:53:29] <chrisboom> Thanks for the help
[23:54:34] <misterm> np
[23:56:35] <paul_irish> sup
[23:57:25] <misterm> hallo
