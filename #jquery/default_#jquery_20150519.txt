[00:00:25] <acidjazz> pauled: there is a chrome plugin that shuts off some tabs after so many are open
[00:00:58] <acidjazz> pauled: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en
[00:01:16] <acidjazz> thatll suspend tabs after so many tabs
[00:01:23] <acidjazz> and help cpu
[00:01:30] <pauled> thanks :)
[00:02:10] <Nasp> pauled:  Try and close them as you go
[00:02:24] <pauled> nice extension acidjazz
[00:02:26] <Nasp> I have a had habit of opening a lot of tabs as well
[00:02:36] <Nasp> But i try to close them as i go
[00:02:40] <Mr_Moon> I'm terrible at that. Have four windows with 20 tabs each. Glad to know I'm not the only one ;)
[00:02:44] <Nasp> And those i "think" i might need later i bookmark
[00:03:00] <Nasp> The only reason why i keep tabs open is because i think i need them
[00:03:08] <Nasp> I have a collegue at work who has 200 tabs
[00:03:55] <pauled> I have 6 GB of ram chrome take all the ram when I surf with more than 20 tabs
[00:04:12] <Cork> O_o
[00:04:22] <Cork> jikes
[00:04:29] <Uhkis> yeah, firefox for the win!
[00:04:44] <Cork> and ppl complain when firefox consumes 3g for 1000 tabs...
[00:05:21] <pauled> http://th07.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/166/8/b/tab_by_kris_wilson-d53jolq.png
[00:09:29] <Uhkis> is there a way to show how many tabs are open in ff?
[00:09:45] <Cork> ya
[00:09:47] <Cork> one min
[00:11:41] <pauled> this site make chrome crash when I click on a picture on the right side: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/176836722838163128/
[00:16:51] <Cork> damn i've lost the snippet...
[00:18:47] <Uhkis> so apparently i opened 71 tabs, firefox ate 100MB of ram for those
[00:22:10] <Cork> ah found it
[00:22:29] <Cork> Uhkis: shift+f4
[00:22:35] <Cork> paste var tabs = [], windows = Services.wm.getEnumerator('navigator:browser'); while(windows.hasMoreElements()) { tabs.push(windows.getNext().gBrowser.mTabs.length); } tabs
[00:22:44] <Cork> and hit display
[00:22:53] <Cork> (don't forget to change environment to browser)
[00:35:31] <pauled> how a site like this one can hide the scrollbar https://www.pinterest.com/source/explosm.net/
[00:36:46] <pauled> overflow: hidden?
[00:37:05] <Cork> it doesn't hide any scrollbars for me; but ya that would be the way
[00:38:25] <pauled> because you logged in?
[00:39:04] <pauled> yeah there are class body.noScroll
[00:41:31] <toomus> Hi. Is it possible to turn off input field hints with jQuery??
[00:41:46] <Cork> hints?
[00:41:59] <Cork> are you talking about placeholders?
[00:43:11] <toomus> I don't know is it good name. But I mean situation, when you once fill field, and when you try to fill it again, then appear hint with your previous content.
[00:43:34] <Cork> ah, no that is autocomplete
[00:43:42] <Cork> ?mdn autocomplete
[00:43:43] <b-ot> Cork: Autocomplete - Mozilla | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Code_snippets/Autocomplete
[00:43:51] <Cork> uh... no
[00:43:56] <Cork> ?mdn form autocomplete
[00:43:57] <b-ot> Cork: How to Turn Off Form Autocompletion - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion
[00:44:39] <Cork> toomus: so just set that attribute on the input field to disable it
[00:44:50] <toomus> OK, docs shows how to turn on autocomplete. But how to turn off?
[00:44:51] <Cork> jquery isn't needed
[00:45:18] <Cork> uh...
[00:45:28] <Cork> read it again
[00:46:59] <toomus> browser.formfill.enable ??
[00:47:05] <Cork> no
[00:47:15] <Cork> ... man i gave you what you should use
[00:47:23] <Cork> just look for the info about it on that page
[00:47:34] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#How_to_Turn_Off_the_Autocompletion_Feature
[00:47:42] <xec> lol
[00:48:04] <toomus> LoL, sorry
[00:48:23] <Cork> here is another reference for the same info https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-autocomplete
[01:33:53] <toocwa> ive got a sortable which ive also made draggable into another droppable. it works fine except that the element that is dropped in has all the extra inline CSS that sortable adds e.g. "width: 1313px; right: auto; height: 44px; bottom: auto; opacity: 0.5; z-index: 1000;"
[01:33:58] <toocwa> this is the JS any ideas?: http://pastebin.com/H6jipNHW
[01:34:11] <toocwa> i just want to drop in the original element without all that
[01:37:27] <Mr_Moon> On drop .removeAttr('style') ? Bit hacky... But...
[01:37:54] <toocwa> Yeah is a bit but I guess that would do, I'll try it :P
[01:38:45] <arc_> i used exactly that method on my last project
[01:38:54] <arc_> don't see why it's hacky :p
[01:39:03] <Mr_Moon> Heh guess so
[01:39:05] <toocwa> I thought I was missing something it seemed dumb it would drop it in that state
[01:39:06] <arc_> what's hacky is putting anything into the style attribute in the first place
[01:39:17] <toocwa> well sortable does that not me
[01:39:21] <arc_> ya i know
[01:39:29] <toocwa> oh i see ur saying its bad lol
[01:39:34] <Mr_Moon> Yeah agree arc_
[01:39:36] <arc_> well there's no choice but
[01:39:40] <arc_> there should be a choice :|
[01:39:59] <Cork> arc_: there is a choice
[01:40:02] <toocwa> just figuring out where to do remove style now :P
[01:40:20] <arc_> how can javascript modify the css of objects without the style attribute?
[01:40:28] <Cork> the better option is to move as much of you're styling into css
[01:40:36] <Cork> arc_: by using class
[01:40:40] <Cork> *a class
[01:40:48] <toocwa> youd end up with a crazy amount of classes that arent used 99% of the time though
[01:40:49] <Cork> css should be kept in the stylesheet
[01:40:55] <Cork> no
[01:41:03] <Cork> not if you do it right
[01:41:36] <arc_> idk how all that works. it seems like animation plugins usually set the position and opacity of stuff in the style attribute, so i figured there was no choice
[01:41:55] <arc_> idk why they would do that if you can just do it in the stylesheet
[01:41:57] <Cork> js animation has to set it in the style
[01:42:01] <Cork> there isn't an option there
[01:42:07] <Cork> but you can use css animations instead
[01:42:39] <toocwa> do i do removeAttr() somewhere in drop: function (event, ui) {} ?
[01:43:03] <suexec> I'm having some trouble with jstree. Is this JSON OK: {"id":"\/home\/MyUser\/log\/Test","parent":"\/home\/MyUser\/log\/","text":"Test"} (My concern are the slashes in id's etc, even though they are escaped).
[01:43:32] <Cork> toocwa: you do css({ property1_you_want_to_reset: "", property2: "", property3:"" })
[01:43:44] <Cork> don't just blindly blow away the style attribute
[01:45:07] <toocwa> ok thanks just trying to work out how to even apply that to the dropped element
[01:45:28] <toocwa> ui.draggable.css() doesnt seem to do it unless i clone it first then i end up with 2
[01:52:01] <toocwa> oh it is working, but its adding opacity and z-index back after its dropped
[01:52:11] <toocwa> :/
[01:54:56] <toocwa> it works if i use setTimeout to delay it.. lol
[01:55:04] <toocwa> thats a bit nasty though isnt it
[01:58:16] <KamalKaur> Greetings!
[01:58:58] <KamalKaur> I had been working to edit a text from a division by making it an editable by creating an input field on the fly
[01:59:44] <KamalKaur> But the events on field created on the fly are not being recognized by Jquery
[01:59:52] <KamalKaur> Here is my code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11221806/
[02:00:22] <KamalKaur> What can be done to make it recognize? What wrong I have done?
[02:02:15] <Cork> KamalKaur: you're statically binding to the element that exists at the time line 16 runs
[02:02:26] <Cork> KamalKaur: delegate the event to a static parent instead
[02:02:49] <Cork> ?api delegate @ KamalKaur
[02:02:49] <b-ot> KamalKaur: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:02:49] <KamalKaur> Cork: Can I have an example please?
[02:03:07] <Cork> read that page
[02:08:10] <toocwa> woah
[02:08:35] <toocwa> so if i switch from "on" to "delegate", when elements are dynamically added later it will work on them
[02:09:10] <Cork> toocwa: no
[02:09:20] <toocwa> oh k never mind got excited :P
[02:09:24] <Cork> on can do it too, but it requires a different selector and a different target
[02:09:37] <Cork> so read the description on that page
[02:10:21] <toocwa> oh i see i'll just keep using on then
[02:10:42] <toocwa> i guess i can just have it check clicks on body or something for that
[02:11:24] <toocwa> just thought that might be bad so i started having it run the $("").on(); in a function every time an element is added that needs it (probably bad too)
[02:11:51] <Cork> toocwa: ...
[02:12:00] <Cork> did you even bother reading about what delegate is?
[02:12:15] <toocwa> no it says it was superseded by the on() method
[02:12:17] <Cork> your comment suggest you didn't
[02:12:19] <toocwa> so why would i need it
[02:12:29] <Cork> you need to read about delegation
[02:12:36] <Cork> cause you need to use delegation
[02:12:45] <Cork> and that page is the best place to read about it
[02:12:50] <Cork> as .on is a combination function
[02:13:10] <toocwa> ok
[02:13:30] <decx> this page is better to get a grasp on it http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[02:14:39] <toocwa> thanks both of you. the 2nd one makes sense and is actually waht i meant i could delegate an event to body
[02:15:02] <toocwa> i was actually doing this already but i think the thing i was delegating it to was also being dynamically added so i was doing it wrong
[02:15:26] <toocwa> it worked up until i started dynamically adding that
[02:15:52] <toocwa> eventually you just need to do it when a massive container is clicked e.g. body to capture everything :|
[02:17:37] <toocwa> or in that example <div #container> - body may be a little extreme
[02:25:39] <KamalKaur> Cork: I have gone through that page.  Used .delegate but still missing something
[02:26:09] <Cork> KamalKaur: the point of the page is to get to know how you call to make a delegated event handler
[02:26:18] <Cork> it also tells you how you do delegate with .on
[02:26:52] <Cork> linking to that page isn't cause you should use .delegate (you can if you like, but there isn't a must)
[02:27:25] <KamalKaur> Okay
[03:03:25] <balls-> how should I write a selector so that it selects all elements with .class except those that also have .otherclass?
[03:07:12] <Cork> balls-: $('.firstclass:not(.otherclass)')
[03:07:22] <balls-> thanks
[03:14:28] <balls-> and how would i find out if parent of $(this) has a .class?
[03:15:23] <Cork> .parent('.class').length > 0
[03:21:47] <balls-> cool thanks
[03:24:59] <arc_> btw at favicon size, the jquery logomark really reminds me of at&t
[03:34:08] <checkit> Any bootgrid users in here?
[03:34:14] <checkit> Quick question on prepping a table.
[04:04:51] <checkit> Anythoughts on why I can't dynamically call bootgrid on this table object? http://jsfiddle.net/qbqedLa2/5/
[04:08:20] <Cork> checkit: works fine as far as i can see
[04:08:31] <Cork> only problem is with the "hello" part
[04:08:37] <checkit> Cork right right
[04:09:00] <Cork> checkit: though that said, you should look at a template engine
[04:09:03] <checkit> This is much trimmed down version of what I'm actually working with. Same issue though. Empty cells.
[04:09:07] <Cork> that much html in js is horrible
[04:09:20] <checkit> In the actual script is dynamically generated.
[04:09:47] <checkit> otherwise I agree with you.
[04:09:48] <Cork> well the trimmed down version works
[04:09:53] <Cork> so... look elsewhere
[04:10:20] <checkit> The trimmed down version is showing the same issue. missing cell data...
[04:10:22] <Cork> checkit: the hole point of a template is that you can dynamically generate parts with it
[04:10:38] <Cork> checkit: the data is right there as far as i can see
[04:11:11] <checkit> Cork: Fair enought, but I'm inheriting this with only an hour or two left before it needs to be in production.
[04:11:26] <checkit> The problem is the data not appearing in the table.
[04:11:44] <Cork> well the data in your example do show up
[04:11:45] <Cork> so...
[04:11:48] <checkit> The paging is all correct in the "larger" version, the columns are all there, but all the cells are empty. Or NAN in nymber fields.
[04:12:07] <checkit> I'm just showing NaN in the cell...
[04:12:20] <Cork> ya cause you put hello in a numeric field...
[04:12:35] <Cork> js> print(+"hello")
[04:12:45] <b-ot> Cork: NaN
[04:13:33] <checkit> Shit.. I'd left that in from a previous test.
[04:14:30] <drag0nius> how do i prepare form POST data before submitting in jquery?
[04:14:30] <Uhkis> js> print(+''); print(+''); print(+''); print('aa THUNDER');
[04:14:34] <b-ot> Uhkis: 0 0 0 aa THUNDER
[04:14:43] <Uhkis> what
[04:14:52] <drag0nius> i've to insert inputs into form or what?
[04:14:57] <Uhkis> js> print(+'a'); print(+'a'); print(+'a'); print('aa THUNDER');
[04:15:01] <b-ot> Uhkis: NaN NaN NaN aa THUNDER
[04:15:12] <Uhkis> stupid '' = 0 ruined my joke!
[04:19:31] <arc_> you're missing two na's :p
[04:19:56] <Uhkis> arc_: yeah, i got tired of typing that print(+'') :D
[04:30:18] <Cork> drag0nius: you mean a straight http post
[04:30:20] <Cork> or ajax post?
[04:38:37] <drag0nius> straight http post
[04:39:06] <drag0nius> how do i take 'disabled' off button?
[04:44:00] <Cork> drag0nius: if you want a straight post you have to add elements to the form
[04:44:12] <Cork> drag0nius: about the disabled, just toggle the property
[04:44:20] <Cork> $('button').prop('disabled', false)
[05:01:14] <balls-> is it possible to animate points of a polyline with jquery?
[05:03:11] <balls-> i want points="0,15 293.640625,15 303.640625,5 313.640625,15 1220,15" to turn into points="0,15 new-10,15 new,5 new+10,15 1220,15"
[05:21:15] <aj1114> I have a jquery menu. there is a li that checks for hover and when hovered it displays the inner ul it works fine on desktop (and on emulated chrome mobile devices) but it doesn't trigger the handlerOut on iPad any reasons? is there a woa
[05:21:26] <aj1114> is there a workaround or am I doing something wrong?
[05:23:19] <lite_> I have a container with a specific set of dimensions(lets say 800x600). I wish to fill this container with items and I have the following styling options to use on my items: .large, .medium. and .small using as many .large elements as possible and with as little unused space as possible. There must be a helper library out there to solve a problem like this ?
[05:25:03] <decx> balls-: that doesn't require jquery in any form you just end up moving points[i].x around anyway
[05:26:32] <decx> balls-: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/sag94add/
[05:27:06] <balls-> oh didnÂ´t know the approach was so simple :)
[05:27:10] <balls-> thanks mate
[05:27:42] <decx> yeah the points attribute is formed nicely into an "array" of coordinates
[05:29:37] <kokut> so, i added a big wrapper to my website and for some reason when i wrap it/uwrap it the layout gets all messed up, is there something i can do?
[07:46:52] <cjohnson> fix your CSS to be agnostic of the wrapper
[07:46:57] <cjohnson> kokut: ^
[07:52:49] <kokut> cjohnson: i fixed it with background position
[07:58:27] <cjohnson> cool glad you fixed your CSS :)
[08:00:22] <kokut> cjohnson: ty :)
[08:08:24] <step1ste_> javascript related question: how do i select *.filetype?
[08:08:36] <cjohnson> step1ste_: what do you mean
[08:08:55] <Zeranoe> Is it possible to only set a default date for datepicker if the value="" for the select class is empty? If the value="" is set I do not want datepicker entering a default. Right now I have it inserting a default date with #( ".datepicker" ).datepicker().datepicker("setDate", new Date());
[08:09:26] <step1ste_> i want to read all *.filetype files
[08:09:35] <cjohnson> step1ste_: node.js?
[08:09:39] <step1ste_> yup
[08:09:52] <cjohnson> recursively? or just in one directory
[08:10:25] <step1ste_> recursively
[08:10:48] <cjohnson> https://www.npmjs.com/package/recursive-readdir
[08:11:51] <cjohnson> and then inside the callback, check the filename using a regex .match
[08:12:04] <Rashu> Odd question: how can I get rid of a fixed position and a top pixel amount whilst simultaneously scrolling the users window without it being jerky? I currently can do it on my site but theres a split second where you notice its not smooth
[08:12:07] <cjohnson> .match(/\.jpg$/i) will return true if it's .jpg for instance
[08:12:12] <cjohnson> false for any other file type
[08:12:29] <cjohnson> Zeranoe: why not just set the value="" in order to default to a date?
[08:12:35] <step1ste_> like that? var csproj = fs.readFileSync(recursive('*.js')).toString();
[08:12:40] <Rashu> I know it can be smooth because Facebook does a similar effect that I'm going for and theirs doesnt jerk
[08:13:02] <cjohnson> step1ste_: er, no. look at the example on the page I gave
[08:13:15] <cjohnson> and read what I just wrote to you
[08:13:20] <cjohnson> really this belongs in #node.js though
[08:13:48] <cjohnson> Rashu: link?
[08:14:47] <Rashu> cjohnson: develop.mamiller93.com/projects/milvil you have to have your browser's height almost "mobile" size and scroll down a little bit. Then click the request red button. then click out
[08:14:58] <Rashu> I know it's a little bit convoluted :/ sorry
[08:15:38] <cjohnson> I don't see a fixed element? and I don't see any sluggish performance
[08:16:57] <Rashu> cjohnson when you click the request button, the background becomes fixed where you scroll. This makes it better so that when you scroll the overlay, the background doesnt move too. My issue is when the overlay disappears, the background is simultaneously getting rid of the css and moving to where it used to be
[08:17:08] <Rashu> that latter part I find is a little jerky
[08:17:30] <syflipper> o/
[08:20:27] <cjohnson> hrm, works fine here Rashu
[08:20:37] <Rashu> cjohnson weird. what browser?
[08:20:40] <cjohnson> chrome os x
[08:20:44] <Rashu> hm
[08:21:32] <Rashu> cjohnson, youre right! chrome os x works just as I want it to!
[08:21:51] <Rashu> cjohnson, could you try Safari for me? That's what I usually use for testing and that's where I find it jerky
[08:23:06] <syflipper> guys, has any of you seen a snippet lately to swipe html select options?
[08:23:12] <cjohnson> hrm, yeah, it jumps a little bit
[08:23:28] <Rashu> phew, I thought I was going crazy
[08:23:29] <cjohnson> I'm not sure why tho honestly
[08:23:34] <Rashu> yeah. I dont know how to fix that
[08:23:36] <Rashu> darn
[08:23:36] <Rashu> haha
[08:23:44] <Rashu> I appreciate you looking into it though :) thanks
[08:26:10] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning #jquery
[08:27:07] <mooncup> I can't work out if you're doing a newreader or american dad
[08:27:11] <mooncup> but either way good morning
[08:27:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.  neither, but good one :)
[08:27:36] <arc_> Rashu <div id="modalContainer" style="top: -161px;">
[08:27:43] <arc_> this is being set when you open the modal
[08:27:51] <arc_> if i change this to 0px, it doesn't change the layout at all
[08:28:01] <arc_> and when it closes, it works fine
[08:28:04] <Rashu> oh at the end?
[08:28:14] <Rashu> I add it in the beginning so that it looks like the background doesnt move
[08:28:37] <Rashu> I'll try it out, arc_! Thanks
[08:28:51] <arc_> i didn't make any suggestion, i was just trying to figure out what you were doing :p
[08:29:46] <Rashu> ah well I add the offset of the users browser as the top and I add the class "clip" to body so that the background becomes position fixed
[08:30:01] <Rashu> that combination makes it look like the background is still scrolled to that position, if that makes any sense
[08:30:06] <arc_> why is the modal appearing at the top of the page
[08:30:13] <arc_> it should appear where the user is scrolled to
[08:30:29] <arc_> you shouldn't have to do this positioning hack to get the background not to scroll
[08:30:30] <Rashu> errr wat
[08:31:04] <Rashu> oh oh I see what you're asking. Yeah I had that originally except when you scroll, it automatically scrolls the background too
[08:31:09] <Rashu> and I didn't like that effect
[08:31:26] <Rashu> I wanted the background to be stationary, like a real overlay in life
[08:31:40] <arc_> scroll while the modal is open?
[08:31:57] <Rashu> yes
[08:32:11] <arc_> i can't even do that
[08:32:18] <Rashu> correct, because its position fixed right now
[08:32:21] <arc_> heh ok
[08:32:24] <Rashu> that's my "hack" now
[08:32:59] <Rashu> I took a look at how Facebook does it too and they use some combination of position fixed, top, and some other stuff that I can't really follow to get it all nice nice
[08:33:09] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[08:33:20] <arc_> well, can't you use scrollto and disable scrolling while the modal is open
[08:33:51] <Rashu> arc_ that's why I get rid of the position fixed before I use scrollTo :)
[08:34:23] <Rashu> robertmaxrees, develop.mamiller93.com/projects/milvil if you make your browser height to a "mobile size", scroll down a little bit, click the red request button and then click out of it, it should be a little jerky in Safari
[08:34:32] <Rashu> cjohnson noticed it works lovely in chrome os x
[08:34:39] <Rashu> which I also dont really understand :/ but yeah
[08:34:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:34:50] <robertmaxrees> what does browser height have to do with anything?
[08:35:00] <arc_> well it's the mobile layout
[08:35:02] <Rashu> I'm just trying to simultaneously remove a fixed positioning and top
[08:35:07] <robertmaxrees> youmean width?
[08:35:11] <Rashu> robertmaxrees no, height
[08:35:26] <arc_> so it happens at any width?
[08:35:57] <robertmaxrees> the animation is slightly janky on open in chrome for me.
[08:35:59] <Rashu> it doesnt have to scroll on a desktop. If you take a look, the overlay is not that long! Scrolling only happens on a mobile-ish height
[08:36:06] <Rashu> on open?! ._.
[08:36:15] <robertmaxrees> very slightest jank going on.
[08:36:42] <arc_> it works fine for me in chrome windows, at 2560x800
[08:36:56] <Rashu> hmmm
[08:36:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm in chrome wiondows as well.  really subtle jerkiness.
[08:37:00] <arc_> ah ok actually it does mess up if i have to scroll down first
[08:37:12] <Rashu> robertmaxrees yeah, that jank! it stank!
[08:37:26] <arc_> the div moves back up before it fades out
[08:37:29] <Rashu> right
[08:37:45] <Rashu> its just a mishmosh of effects that dont go smoothly :(
[08:37:51] <Rashu> and I'm not sure how to fix it all
[08:38:47] <arc_> also the whole site moves over because the scrollbar is enabled when the modal pops up
[08:38:51] <robertmaxrees> you want to use position: fixed; on modal-contentWrap
[08:39:33] <robertmaxrees> then set margin-left to 177px
[08:39:42] <Rashu> margin-left?
[08:39:46] <robertmaxrees> err, -177 px
[08:39:56] <MarkProffitt> Hello jewetnit
[08:40:27] <robertmaxrees> Rashu just trust me.  change position: relaive; to position: fixed; and add margin-left: -177px;
[08:40:30] <Rashu> arc_ eh, that's okay I think. I dont know what it looks like... but I wouldnt know how to combat that
[08:40:34] <Rashu> okay
[08:40:48] <arc_> well, the div doesn't move up before fading out now, but it disappears instantly instead of fading out
[08:40:49] <Rashu> robertmaxrees should this be dynamic or just add it in the css stylesheet
[08:40:58] <robertmaxrees> add it to the css.
[08:42:01] <arc_> weird. the fade out animation is clipped by the window size
[08:42:02] <tocka> hi guys, just wanted to ask, does anyone know any demos that lets say animate iphone receiving a text or something like that?
[08:42:12] <arc_> the part of the div that is not inside the window is invisible during the fade out
[08:42:40] <Rashu> robertmaxrees, that makes it so you can't scroll anymore when the modal pops up - I'll push it to my server. one moment
[08:42:55] <arc_> i thought that's what you wanted
[08:42:56] <robertmaxrees> Rashu that's a pretty common thing to do - prevent scroll.
[08:43:10] <Rashu> arc_, I want to prevent scrolling on the background! not the modal!
[08:43:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you end up confusing users.  they lose context.
[08:43:21] <Rashu> take a look, robertmaxrees
[08:43:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you did this all wrong duder.
[08:43:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:44:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah, first off your overlay is all wrong.
[08:44:43] <MarkProffitt> jewetnit  I'm trying to convert an empty UL to a different class with different event handle when the last LI is dragged out. I have   $(ev.target).sortable("destroy");   code in "update" event of the UL. The LI is disappearing before it is attached to the new location.  Is there a different event this code should be in?
[08:45:02] <robertmaxrees> Rashu did you hand-roll this modal?
[08:45:08] <Rashu> no
[08:45:21] <Rashu> I only edited it so that the background wouldnt scroll
[08:45:35] <robertmaxrees> edited, or applied overrides?
[08:45:59] <Rashu> edited. I didnt change anything to the code, only added the extra css
[08:46:03] <Rashu> one moment
[08:46:07] <robertmaxrees> if you edited, back up your changes and revert everything.  preventing scroll is a pretty simple thing.
[08:46:29] <Rashu> okay, one sec!
[08:46:56] <arc_> yeah i would have thought that would just be an option in how you invoke the plugin
[08:47:17] <robertmaxrees> it should be a default, but i'm guessing they have some css that's conflicting with that.
[08:47:55] <robertmaxrees> also: what devices should this work on?
[08:48:11] <tocka> does anyone know of other animations like stripe uses here? (when you press show me) https://stripe.com/checkout
[08:48:28] <Rashu> robertmaxrees, ideally all. Shouldnt discriminate. I didn't see an option
[08:49:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  so if you want to prevent the window from scrolling, all you should do is set overflow: hidden; on body.
[08:49:59] <robertmaxrees> the modal itself should be display: block; with position: fixed;
[08:50:22] <arc_> tocka this is similar http://www.themepunch.com/portfolio/slider-revolution-jquery-plugin/
[08:50:37] <tocka> arc_ thanks!
[08:50:38] <tocka> :)
[08:50:58] <robertmaxrees> the overfay should be set to overflow: scroll; - that should get you mostly there unless you have conflicting styles.
[08:51:15] <tocka> arc_ i just basically need more case studies where those kind of presentation animations are being used.. to show to my manager ;|
[08:51:19] <tocka> coding is not the issue now :D
[08:51:21] <robertmaxrees> *overlay
[08:51:29] <arc_> oic
[08:51:42] <Rashu> robertmaxrees working on it!
[08:52:06] <Rashu> robertmaxrees just finally reverted the original code
[08:57:39] <Rashu> robertmaxrees the modal container or the modal itself should be fixed?
[08:58:10] <robertmaxrees> technically, both
[08:58:17] <robertmaxrees> butr the container should already have that.
[08:58:23] <robertmaxrees> if not, this is a weird lib.
[09:02:12] <Rashu> robertmaxrees, refresh :/ I think I'm doing something wrong
[09:02:21] <robertmaxrees> i closed the window.
[09:02:22] <robertmaxrees> link?
[09:02:36] <Rashu> develop.mamiller93.com/projects/milvil  redmenace
[09:02:37] <Rashu> err
[09:02:39] <Rashu> robertmaxrees
[09:03:21] <robertmaxrees> woah.  this lib is batty.
[09:03:26] <Rashu> lol
[09:03:43] <robertmaxrees> seriously wtf.
[09:04:18] <Rashu> did i add one too many fixed's?
[09:04:24] <arc_> how hard can it be to position a div in the center of the browser window -_-
[09:04:32] <Rashu> pretty damn hard :P
[09:04:34] <robertmaxrees> arc_ it's not.  something is seriously broken here.
[09:04:38] <arc_> i know
[09:04:46] <arc_> also the X button doesn't work now
[09:05:13] <Rashu> arc_ yeah, that was a bug in the code that I fixed myself. I'll fix it later
[09:05:36] <robertmaxrees> ....
[09:05:36] <robertmaxrees> uh
[09:06:14] <robertmaxrees> you're aware <div id="modalContainer"> wraps the entire page, right?
[09:06:21] <Rashu> arc_ howd you even get to the X?
[09:06:32] <robertmaxrees> doesn't seem to make a difference, weird.
[09:06:51] <arc_> it scrolls me to the top when i click the red button
[09:07:01] <Rashu> robertmaxrees, yes because the modal is outside of that
[09:07:15] <robertmaxrees> ah that's your overlay hack?
[09:07:22] <Rashu> arc_... my modal shows up at the top left and I cant even click it
[09:07:36] <robertmaxrees> Rashu they're messing with it in their dev tools.
[09:07:39] <Rashu> robertmaxrees hmmm I dont believe so. thats a good question though :/
[09:07:47] <arc_> that was without me doing anything
[09:08:03] <arc_> i may have been on an old version of the page though
[09:08:07] <jewetnit> MarkProffitt: hey I was away
[09:08:09] <arc_> now it doesn't display at all
[09:08:16] <jewetnit> do you have a fiddle, or is it fixed already?
[09:09:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah Rashu this lib is funky.  it should be using fixed positioning to take care of some of the jank.
[09:09:52] <robertmaxrees> but its not.
[09:09:54] <arc_> so ... could you just use a different plugin if there is a better one someone could suggest
[09:10:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd go back to what you had to use something different.
[09:10:13] <MarkProffitt> How do find the UL element a sortable LI is being moved to from an event in the UL the LI is being moved out of?
[09:10:35] <Rashu> as in, put back all of my edits and figure something else out? perhaps I could add the overflow hidden on what I had?
[09:10:49] <robertmaxrees> Rashu that's not going to fix your issue.s
[09:10:57] <MarkProffitt> event.target.____   ui.____   ????
[09:11:14] <Rashu> robertmaxrees not doubting you, just trying to learn: why wont it fix my issues?
[09:11:16] <robertmaxrees> you have 2 problems: 1 - poor performance.  2 - funky css.
[09:11:21] <Rashu> ah
[09:11:38] <Rashu> robertmaxrees do you have a better library that you love?
[09:11:46] <robertmaxrees> jqmodal is a decent one.
[09:12:28] <robertmaxrees> some people really like fancybox.  other folks really like the one with bootstrap, but that only makes sense if you're already using bootstrap.
[09:13:00] <Rashu> hmm the reason I liked my lib was because of the background fade
[09:13:14] <robertmaxrees> most people won't notice those things.
[09:13:31] <robertmaxrees> if you really want it, it's easy to add using transitions.
[09:15:42] <arc_> it's not only what you notice that's important about ux ;)
[09:15:56] <Rashu> robertmaxrees I'm also look at jqmodal and seeing if the browser height is small enough to cover the modal, if it will scroll
[09:16:41] <robertmaxrees> arc_ i work for a pretty large ecommerce company - i'm pretty well aware of UX ;)
[09:17:04] <robertmaxrees> Rashu you might have to bake that in yourself.  should be pretty trivial.
[09:17:18] <Rashu> thats why I was editing my modal library ._.
[09:17:23] <Rashu> and I apparently did it wrong
[09:17:24] <Rashu> lol
[09:17:53] <robertmaxrees> set the modal's max-height to 100% and overflow-y: scroll;  there are some other ways to handle this.
[09:18:11] <robertmaxrees> i will again point out that modals on mobile devices are generally avoided because they're hard for users to work with.
[09:18:47] <Rashu> robertmaxrees surprisingly the modal I had was pretty easy :)
[09:19:04] <robertmaxrees> Rashu then go back to what you had and hit up #css.
[09:32:18] <Rashu> hey robertmaxrees, do you think you could refresh the page one last time and see if you still see the issue?
[09:33:35] <robertmaxrees> double scrollbars on desktop.
[09:33:44] <robertmaxrees> mobile still seems jittery
[09:39:33] <KnightsOfNi>  if you have a container with a variable width filled with divs floated to the right, is it possible to select only the divs that touch the right side of the container?
[09:39:52] <Rashu> robertmaxrees what os / browser?
[09:40:00] <robertmaxrees> Rashu windows, chrome.
[09:40:17] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfNi ish.
[09:40:30] <KnightsOfNi> ish?
[09:40:34] <robertmaxrees> http://www.heydonworks.com/article/tetris-the-power-of-css
[09:40:58] <robertmaxrees> this tells you how to select things like that.
[09:41:22] <robertmaxrees> that assumes you have some kind of consistent grid
[09:41:48] <KnightsOfNi> yeah but that is for nth child, this container I have can contain any number of columns
[09:42:01] <robertmaxrees> then no.  hence the ish :)
[09:42:28] <KnightsOfNi> really?
[09:42:36] <robertmaxrees> you could filter to get those elements.
[09:42:45] <robertmaxrees> but it'd require some interesting math and comparisons.
[09:44:24] <KnightsOfNi> I guess I could take the width of the container and then calculate the amount of columns
[09:44:54] <robertmaxrees> that's one way - why are you looking to select those particular elements in the first place though?
[09:46:01] <KnightsOfNi> well I have a jscrollpane with a horizontal scroller, and the number of items in that pane is variable. Each item has a right-padding, except the last one in each column should have no padding
[09:46:40] <KnightsOfNi> to keep spaces between the boxes, the right-most box should touch the edge of the container without margin on the right
[09:46:56] <KnightsOfNi> Or am I taking a wrong approach here? :)
[09:47:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[09:47:24] <robertmaxrees> and/or ask in #css
[09:49:01] <KnightsOfNi> perhaps I could give the container a right margin of -3px to compensate?
[09:49:13] <KnightsOfNi> padding -3px
[09:53:42] <robertmaxrees> you could try things like that, sure.
[09:58:13] <robertmaxrees> helluva morning so far.
[09:58:37] <effy> hey
[09:59:28] <robertmaxrees> 'ello!
[10:00:28] <effy> what are your opinions  on jQuery shims like zepto? Does it make sense to not use jQuery because of the file size.
[10:00:35] <robertmaxrees> "jquery shims"?
[10:01:03] <effy> as in the exact same api
[10:01:16] <robertmaxrees> zepto doesn't support all of the same browsers jquery does.
[10:02:03] <robertmaxrees> if filesize is that important to you, make sure all the images on your site are properly compressed - you'll save plenty of pageweight that way.
[10:03:18] <robertmaxrees> also, zepto doesn't have the exact same API, nor does it claim to :)
[10:03:37] <arc_> if more than one site pulls jquery from the same url, does it pull from the cache or download multiple copies
[10:03:50] <robertmaxrees> the cached one.
[10:04:02] <arc_> so it probably doesn't matter at all in a lot of cases
[10:04:05] <arc_> jquery is ubiquitous
[10:04:11] <robertmaxrees> arc_ errr.
[10:04:25] <robertmaxrees> except that different sites use different versions from different cdns.
[10:04:38] <arc_> well yes of course, but there will be overlap
[10:04:45] <robertmaxrees> not as much as you'd thing :)
[10:04:47] <robertmaxrees> *thinl
[10:04:52] <arc_> perhaps not
[10:04:57] <robertmaxrees> **think - and dns overhead can be an issue too.
[10:05:12] <effy> what can jquery do zepto can't?
[10:05:34] <robertmaxrees> support IE9 and below.
[10:05:45] <arthurvr> effy: I guess if you run the jquery unit tests on zepto youâ€™ll quickly know :)
[10:05:57] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[10:06:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a good way to do that.
[10:06:45] <effy> ok thank you. I'll stay using jQuery as you guys seem negative.
[10:06:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:06:51] <slinky_> which javascript function that displays elements after going down the site of the bar?
[10:06:59] <robertmaxrees> negative?
[10:07:16] <effy> you guys don't like zepto from what I can tell?
[10:07:30] <robertmaxrees> effy well, this IS the official jquery support channel :)
[10:07:49] <robertmaxrees> we're going to be naturally biased, but the zepto project isn't a fulyl jquery replacement.
[10:08:47] <robertmaxrees> slinky_ your question doesnt' really make much sense.  could you clarify?
[10:44:36] <flashpoint9> I am getting an error from this code http://dpaste.com/0YZAYG1 seems like I have done this plenty of times before
[10:46:03] <tasaif> flashpoint9: you're defining the function wrong
[10:46:42] <tasaif> either function slideArrow(){
[10:46:43] <tasaif> or
[10:46:49] <tasaif> var slideArrow = function() {
[10:48:15] <flashpoint9> tasaif: yep fixed, thanks :)
[10:48:18] <decx> bit detailed too don't you think
[10:48:26] <decx> having to go into js everytime you want a new slide
[11:09:49] <flashpoint9> getting some strange functionality http://dpaste.com/0ND2WVG. The console.log fires when when I change the url parameter hash but the removeClass doesnt work unless i refresh the page
[11:13:10] <Cork> flashpoint9: make a jsfiddle
[11:13:17] <flashpoint9> Cork: ok
[11:14:21] <Kavukamari> can i reference json data by its properties, like myAjaxVar.datalist[3].property1, when it's gotten by ajax? or do I need to parsejson before I can do that
[11:14:57] <tasaif> I think that depends on what kind of type you put on your ajax call if I'm not mistaken
[11:15:12] <Kavukamari> what about if I use $.getJSON()
[11:15:14] <tasaif> dataType: 'json' or something like that
[11:15:24] <Cork> Kavukamari: to clear something up a bit {} <-- object, [] <-- array, "{}" or "[]" <-- json
[11:15:40] <Cork> Kavukamari: if you give the response the correct content-type from the server
[11:15:51] <Cork> you shouldn't have json in the response variable
[11:16:14] <Cork> cause jquery will already have parsed the json into native data types
[11:16:27] <tasaif> based on the documentation, getJSON does do that
[11:16:38] <Kavukamari> yeah that's what i mean, if it receives properly formatted json (which it should) it autoparses it?
[11:16:57] <Cork> Kavukamari: so for example, if you use php and in php call header("Content-Type: application/json") before you render the response
[11:17:00] <Cork> it will just work
[11:17:16] <Cork> Kavukamari: the format doesn't matter
[11:17:27] <Cork> Kavukamari: what matters is that the server doesn't lie about what it sends
[11:17:32] <Kavukamari> ajax stuff is totally new to me so it's a bit confusing
[11:17:42] <Cork> if the server sends json but says it is "text/html"
[11:17:49] <Cork> jquery won't magically understand it is json
[11:18:25] <Cork> Kavukamari: this isn't specific to ajax
[11:18:25] <Kavukamari> it should be sending it with the json header i think
[11:18:31] <Cork> Kavukamari: it is just how http works
[11:18:43] <Cork> Kavukamari: check the network tab for the response
[11:19:01] <Cork> if you send the correct header, then yes it will be parsed by default
[11:19:38] <Kavukamari> but assuming all that is correct, I should be able to just reference the data sensibly like parent.childlist[num].property ?
[11:20:11] <Cork> yes
[11:20:26] <Cork> (but don't assume)
[11:20:53] <Cork> this is easy to verify so just verify it instead
[11:20:59] <flashpoint9> Cork: made the jsfiddle but the code i made is dependent on window.location.hash
[11:21:24] <Kavukamari> im pretty sure i just have to tell the server I want json in the request and it will give json
[11:21:33] <Kavukamari> cause thats what the documentation seemsto imply
[11:21:49] <Cork> Kavukamari: make a request to the server, get the response
[11:22:00] <Cork> and then check the browser developer > network info for the request
[11:22:13] <Cork> then you KNOW if the server is responding correctly
[11:22:40] <Cork> if you start debugging based on the assumption that "the server is doing it correctly"
[11:22:51] <Cork> you can burn hours for something that might be easily fixed
[11:23:49] <tasaif> (you need to burn hours so that you learn your lesson)
[11:24:14] <tasaif> it becomes visceral instead of good practice
[11:28:06] <Kartagis> Cork: remember my POST issue from the other day?
[11:30:49] <flashpoint9> Cork: I figured it out, the selector i was using to show the item wasnt as specific as the hide, thus always taking presedence over showing the item
[11:32:20] <Cork> ah
[11:32:34] <Cork> flashpoint9: classic, setting a class on an element with styled ids? :D
[11:32:51] <Cork> Kartagis: not without hints
[11:33:19] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yp9euk4z/3/
[11:34:01] <Kartagis> Cork: this wasn't working because the site is behind CAS
[11:34:21] <Kartagis> Central Authentication Service
[11:34:39] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/yp9euk4z/5/
[11:35:22] <Cork> Kartagis: so you need to perform basic auth or what?
[11:35:52] <Kartagis> Cork: idk how that works
[11:36:41] <cjohnson> Given var node = $('ul#foo'); how can I find ul#foo > li without re-using the selector?
[11:37:07] <cjohnson> $(node).find('> li') doesn't work
[11:37:26] <Cork> node.find('> li') or the code you gave should work
[11:37:31] <cjohnson> hrm.
[11:37:35] <Cork> cjohnson: btw don't put element names infront of ids
[11:37:38] <jewetnit> cjohnson: did you try $('>li', node)
[11:37:52] <Cork> jewetnit: that is just a shorthand for .find
[11:37:54] <cjohnson> should be same as node.find
[11:37:57] <cjohnson> maybe I'm being dumb
[11:38:04] <Cork> it literally runs .find internally

[11:53:53] <jQUESTIONS> Ok cool, so I'm doing a basic if statement with a few 'or's in the condition. How do I select the or that makes the statement true?
[11:54:33] <Cork> ?code @ jQUESTIONS
[11:54:39] <Cork> hmm
[11:54:41] <Cork> ?paste

[11:54:48] <Cork> * ^
[11:55:56] <jQUESTIONS> http://jsfiddle.net/d6catu8w/
[11:57:11] <Cork> jQUESTIONS: you would have to add some more context
[11:57:18] <Cork> cause it isn't clear what you're trying to do
[11:57:36] <Cork> the hasClass calls in the if case looks over complicated though
[11:57:51] <Cork> but not enough context to tell for sure
[11:59:49] <jQUESTIONS> yeah, i'm basically just trying to make the blocks rotate by switching positions with each other.
[11:59:54] <jQUESTIONS> I have the positions set absolutely with the class
[12:00:35] <Cork> so you want to know what element has the upperLeft and set upperRight to the next one or what?
[12:01:06] <jQUESTIONS> yeah basically
[12:01:15] <jQUESTIONS> if it has upperLeft, set it to upperRight
[12:01:40] <Cork> all of them?
[12:02:03] <jQUESTIONS> yeah there are four of them
[12:02:34] <Cork> then just do $('.upperLeft').removeClass('upperLeft').addClass('upperRight')
[12:02:37] <Cork> no need for the if case
[12:04:19] <jQUESTIONS> But will that be able to be called multiple times?
[12:04:27] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:05:12] <Cork> jQUESTIONS: sure, it will only work on the element as long as something adds back the class though
[12:05:24] <Cork> as it removes the class it uses as a selector
[12:05:49] <jQUESTIONS> Ok awesome!
[12:05:50] <jQUESTIONS> thanks much!
[12:14:37] <cubud> Hi all. I really like the way this data editor pops up UI's and posts rest to the server but it has a load of server side stuff too. Does anyone know anything similar that is client-side only? https://editor.datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> cubud you cna use datatables completely client-side.
[12:16:07] <cubud> robertmaxrees: I'm suspicious there might be something that is more commonly used (i.e. jQuery is popular for javascript......X is popular for popup editors/rest in jQuery)
[12:16:18] <robertmaxrees> popup editors?  like modals?
[12:16:29] <robertmaxrees> not sure which part you're specifically looking for.
[12:16:50] <notchris> How do I wrap an item by 3 divs
[12:16:52] <notchris> In example
[12:17:50] <notchris> $(â€˜pâ€™).wrap(â€˜<div><div id=â€œxâ€></div></div></div>â€™);
[12:18:02] <notchris> Can I specify what part to wrap in
[12:18:10] <notchris> Or should I just append the closed div inside afterwarsa
[12:18:13] <notchris> afterwards
[12:18:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html, but read this - http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> it directly addresses that question :)
[12:21:37] <cubud> I suppose I just need the popup. Ajax is a pretty standard part of jQuery
[12:21:55] <robertmaxrees> that's driven by bootstrap.  otherwise, grab a modaling library.
[12:22:02] <robertmaxrees> and then build out the form in that, cubud
[12:22:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm not aware of any "form modaling" library out there.  doesn't mean something doesn't exist, but I doubt anyuthing worthwhile would.
[12:23:07] <cubud> I suppose I am looking for something that doesn't require me to have the source grid refresh the edited row etc - seems like a lot of repetition when I have lots of places in a site that do the same thing
[12:23:24] <robertmaxrees> then write helpfer functions that do that.
[12:23:59] <cubud> Beyond my current skill level in jQuery :)
[12:24:08] <cubud> Oh well :)
[12:24:11] <robertmaxrees> *javascript, and good :)  great time to learn :D
[12:24:24] <robertmaxrees> there aren't plugins for every little action fwiw.
[12:25:22] <decx> i believe there are
[12:25:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:25:37] <decx> there is?!
[12:25:39] <cubud> You mean there isn't a plugin to make an egg on a spring bounce off a shelf and do a somersault into a box? :)
[12:26:27] <decx> yeah i saw that on hn the other day
[12:26:59] <cubud> What is hn?
[12:27:03] <robertmaxrees> hackernews
[12:27:12] <decx> http://news.ycombinator.com

[12:37:14] <Cork> ya
[12:40:06] <ExtraSteve> Is there a good way of modifying query string hash parameters with jquery?
[12:40:18] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[12:40:21] <robertmaxrees> need to use raw javascript.
[12:41:15] <ExtraSteve> So a user clicks a button then the url changes to mypage.html#stuff without reloading mypage.html
[12:41:24] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[12:41:31] <ExtraSteve> WEll, I suppose that's not really js :p
[12:41:40] <ExtraSteve> That's just a button with a link
[12:41:41] <robertmaxrees> err.  it IS JS.
[12:41:46] <robertmaxrees> or that yeah.
[12:42:02] <robertmaxrees> window.location.hash is your other option.
[12:42:22] <ExtraSteve> Ah, and I can just dump all my junk in there, eh?
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> a string, yeah...
[12:42:36] <ExtraSteve> Sweet
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> how much "stuff" do you have?
[12:42:53] <ExtraSteve> Just a few short parameters - a date and two times
[12:43:00] <robertmaxrees> then yeah you're good.
[12:43:02] <ExtraSteve> And I don't want a page reload
[12:43:19] <robertmaxrees> you can edit the URL without page reloads depending onbrowser support.
[12:43:26] <ExtraSteve> But I want linkable URLs, ya know?
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:43:38] <robertmaxrees> hashes have some tradeoffs.
[12:43:53] <ExtraSteve> I know they'll mess with my anchors, should i have any
[12:44:03] <robertmaxrees> and that data isn't sent to the server.
[12:44:14] <ExtraSteve> Right - needs to be read by my js
[12:44:19] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[12:44:22] <ExtraSteve> And then I'll ajax it to the server
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> if you want it - this is a good choice for browers that support it so you don't have to boostratp things client-side.
[12:45:23] <ExtraSteve> *click*
[12:46:36] <ExtraSteve> Thanks robertmaxrees :)
[12:46:39] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[12:47:18] <MikeD_> is it better to do $('.parent .child .grandchild').somesuch();   or $('.parent').find('.child').find('.grandchild').somesuch(); ?
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[12:49:38] <MikeD_> thanks, that's what I assumed - but i didn't know if the first way might be getting the advantage of built-in feature
[12:49:48] <MikeD_> built-in (to the browser)
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> honestly, the difference is going to be minimal overall.
[12:50:24] <Cork> as long as you're dom isn't huge
[12:50:34] <robertmaxrees> aye, and not super complex.
[12:50:35] <Cork> then even the small things matter
[12:50:50] <robertmaxrees> but don't prematurely optimize.
[12:51:02] <Cork> true
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> go for readability first.
[12:51:11] <Cork> optimize for readability first
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> haha exactly.
[12:51:21] <Cork> speed when it gives problem
[12:51:38] <MikeD_> all that said, which code would you rather inherit?
[12:51:45] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[12:52:03] <Cork> MikeD_: not .find().find() at least
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> honestly, I'd rather get $container.find('.maybeaparent .theelement');
[12:52:22] <robertmaxrees> at most.
[12:52:29] <Cork> ya
[12:52:32] <Cork> same here
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> your markup should be descriptive enough of your page that you don't have chained find calls.
[12:52:45] <Cork> ($ in the variable name is optional)
[13:06:11] <forQuery> assuming we only have one item on the page...
[13:06:28] <forQuery> is it better to use .on("click", function(){} )  or .click(function(){   })
[13:07:08] <forQuery> also, if you have multiple elements on the page, is it better to use .on() and deletegate to the closest parent?  or to the document body?
[13:07:44] <MikeD_> i always use .on() for consistency sake
[13:07:58] <MikeD_> and i prefer delegation to the parent
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> forQuery .click() calls .on('click')
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> and i prefer to delegate to the closest common parent.
[13:16:58] <MarkProffitt> What is the correct property ???   if($(this) === $("#"+ui.sender.attr("id")).nextElementSibling)
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> if you have jquery, use it.
[13:20:17] <MarkProffitt> I need to test if the nextElementSibling is the same as the one having an element dropped from a sort.  I've tried every combination of event, target, ui and all I get is error.  What is the correct property to use?
[13:20:28] <rn10950> Is there a way to disable onClick for a child element of a parent that has it?
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> nextElementSibling is raw DOM, not jquery.  that's why you're getting that error.
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> try .next()
[13:25:27] <robertmaxrees> and you don't want === in this case.
[13:25:36] <robertmaxrees> object equality doesn't work the way you think it does.
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> try if ($(this).is(ui.sender)) {};
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> or something like that.
[13:38:47] <RedRat_> hi guys, is possible to "instance" jquery into variable and not on default $?
[13:39:00] <MarkProffitt> Is it possible to get this without all these levels of . . . .    		if(this.id === $("#"+ui.sender.attr("id")).next().attr("id")) {
[13:39:10] <Cork> ?api noConflict @ RedRat_
[13:39:10] <b-ot> RedRat_: No matches.
[13:39:14] <Cork> ...
[13:39:17] <Cork> ?api noConflict
[13:39:17] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> MarkProffitt i just showed you what you need.
[13:39:25] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[13:39:26] <MarkProffitt> It didn't work
[13:39:27] <tx> Hey guys, I have a bunch of divs that are "screens (UI storyboards)". I want to fade between them but their positioning is relative.
[13:39:31] <robertmaxrees> markoa you cannot use === in this case.
[13:39:34] <tx> I've been working on all of them under this fact.
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> err, MarkProffitt
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> === is not what you want.
[13:39:44] <tx> Is there a way I can fade between them without stuff moving everywhere?
[13:39:49] <RedRat_> Cork, but noconflict needs to have on jquery on $, isn't it?
[13:40:01] <robertmaxrees> at least not in the way you need it.  can you make a fiddle showing what you're doing?
[13:40:21] <Cork> RedRat_: the point of noConflict is that jquery restores $ to what it was before jquery was loaded
[13:40:50] <Cork> RedRat_: then you can either grab the return value from it or jQuery directly
[13:41:38] <tx> Anyone? I can't just change each "screen" div to absolute as the content within those divs sorta depends on it.
[13:41:48] <RedRat_> Cork, thanks
[13:42:08] <tx> If I transition between my "screen" divs using fades whilst they are set to relative, I get issues when both are on the screen (because of positioning) during the fade.
[13:42:17] <Cork> tx: you have to make the position absolute
[13:42:28] <Mr_Moon> Tx: really a CSS q rather than jquery
[13:42:32] <Cork> tx: cause as the element show/hide the position will change if you have them relative
[13:42:46] <tx> Can I wrap them somehow?
[13:43:03] <Mr_Moon> Yeah what cork said. For that they kinda have to be absolute.
[13:43:04] <Cork> just have a parent with position: relative
[13:43:12] <Cork> and the absolute position is relative to that
[13:44:49] <Mr_Moon> Why is the positioning of the internal elements a problem?
[13:45:19] <tx> It's very statically defined.
[13:45:37] <tx> er, rather
[13:45:42] <tx> there are many relative divs inside each of them
[13:46:10] <acidjazz> ill relative your div
[13:46:18] <tx> ( Í¡Âº ÍœÊ– Í¡Âº)
[13:46:39] <Mr_Moon> Lol
[13:47:11] <tx> So because of this, if I made each parent absolute
[13:47:20] <tx> everything would collapse and form a black hole.
[13:47:52] <Cork> tx: ok, what do you mean by fade between?
[13:47:54] <Mr_Moon> Worst case... Could you put a relatively positioned wrapper inside the frames that is 100% height/width? Then all elements become relative to the absolute "slides" right?
[13:48:07] <Cork> if they aren't ontop of each other how do you expect to fade between them?
[13:48:24] <tx> Cork:  as one is being faded out, another is being faded in
[13:48:31] <Cork> ah
[13:48:36] <tx> so there is an intermediary time when both are on the screen
[13:48:38] <Cork> now that is a totally different matter
[13:48:52] <Cork> your fading with fadeIn/fadeToggle or the like?
[13:48:57] <tx> yep
[13:49:15] <Cork> use animate({ opacity: 1 or 0 }, time) instead
[13:49:35] <tx> ooh, that's a clever idea.
[13:50:01] <tx> Cork:  If I had a number of these div's (think of them like storyboard screens)
[13:50:18] <tx> what would performance be like with setting opacity on all of the screens that aren't currently being di splayed
[13:50:54] <Cork> tx: i would recommend looking into css3 transition if performance matters to you
[13:51:03] <Cork> and not using js for animations
[13:51:13] <tx> they are also interactive, so I would assume setting their opacity to 0 would still mean that it's still there, just not seen :)
[13:51:27] <Cork> ya
[13:51:38] <tx> ah, dayum.
[13:51:40] <Cork> you could set visibility: hidden
[13:52:00] <tx> after opacity fading?
[13:52:01] <tx> that could work.
[13:52:05] <Cork> yes
[13:52:30] <Cork> (this is how you would do it if you used css3 transition instead)
[13:52:47] <tx> what if I wrapped the children of my "screen" divs with another div that was relative, and then set the screen divs to absolute.
[13:52:53] <tx> Ah, ok.
[13:53:12] <Cork> tx: absolute isn't really needed
[13:53:20] <Cork> i thought you made something other then what you are
[13:53:24] <tx> Oh.
[13:53:45] <tx> Well, they are relative, and because they don't overlap you get bits and pieces on top of each other during transitioning.
[13:53:52] <Cork> tx: what you need is to prevent the element from collapsing
[13:53:53] <tx> Once fading is complete all is well though. :)
[13:54:01] <Cork> meaning you can't use display: none or visibility: collapse
[13:54:14] <Cork> as long as you don't do that you don't need absolute
[13:54:44] <tx> I suppose opacity and then switching without an animation / effect?
[13:55:01] <Cork> tx: animate opacity
[13:55:11] <tx> yeah
[13:55:13] <Cork> when the animation has gone to 0 set visibility: hidden
[13:55:25] <Cork> and before animation to 1 set visibility: visible
[13:55:48] <gelinas2_> cork: won't that still cause problems with their interactivity on the divs?
[13:56:05] <Cork> gelinas2_: not with visibility: hidden
[13:56:19] <Cork> that explicitly tell the browser "this doesn't exist"
[13:57:04] <gelinas2_> hmmm...that wasn't my understanding of visibility
[13:57:10] <aftab> Hello, I am trying to record a video using jquery mobile with the audio clip playing on the device instead of recording voice from the microphone, please let me know how to do that?
[13:57:20] <gelinas2_> I was under the impression that it just causes dead space on the screen
[13:57:37] <gelinas2_> and display: none acts as "this doesn't exist"
[13:58:16] <tx> I'll have a go guys. Cheers Cork / Mr_Moon / gelinas2_.
[13:58:37] <Cork> gelinas2_: display: none; is "ignore this dom tree"
[13:58:48] <Cork> it isn't doesn't exist (in a rendering sense)
[13:59:18] <gelinas2_> well right, but neither is visibility - at least not in my experience
[13:59:22] <Cork> gelinas2_: what i'm trying to say is visibility: hidden; takes space, but doesn't exist
[13:59:34] <Cork> while display: none; isn't even part of the rendering loop
[14:00:10] <Mr_Moon> np
[14:00:20] <Cork> the browser actually drops everything below an element with display: none
[14:00:21] <Mr_Moon> hoping I didn't cause more hassles than help!
[14:00:35] <Cork> it doesn't even process the children
[14:01:49] <Mr_Moon> really? coz I was under the impression the browser would still load / cache images / media below display: none; ?
[14:02:02] <tx> Mr_Moon:  Even if you didn't directly help, I appreciate the discussion. :)
[14:02:04] <Mr_Moon> I mean
[14:02:14] <Mr_Moon> ... I get that it doesn't render... but it's still "there" right?
[14:02:26] <gelinas2_> Mr_Moon: I'm with you on this
[14:02:38] <Cork> Mr_Moon: images are fetches as soon as the element is created
[14:02:47] <Cork> it doesn't depend on if the element is rendered or not
[14:03:07] <Cork> meaning the image element doesn't even have to be added to the document
[14:03:52] <Cork> $('<img>', { src: "url" }); that is literally enough to cache the image
[14:03:59] <Cork> nothing more is needed
[14:04:08] <Mr_Moon> yeah completely separate discussion... sorry! my bad!
[14:04:57] <Cork> Mr_Moon: site note though the image isn't uncompressed and rendered by that though :)
[14:05:19] <Cork> and yes display: none suppresses that part
[14:06:05] <Cork> heh and when we're on the subject
[14:06:17] <Cork> there IS the pointer-event: none; :)

[14:07:26] <aftab> Hello, I am trying to record a video using jquery mobile with the audio clip playing on the device instead of recording voice from the microphone, please let me know how to do that?
[14:07:44] <NoiseEee> make an app
[14:07:46] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[14:07:59] <R-Ratones> Can anyone help ?  this works on IE, why does chrome and firefox change the CDATA tags ?http://jsfiddle.net/b5zxdhml/
[14:08:08] <aftab> NoiseEee: that is what i am trying to do :)
[14:08:19] <NoiseEee> aftab: a native app.
[14:09:32] <Cork> R-Ratones: what part is changing?
[14:09:52] <aftab> NoiseEee: Yes it will be a native app, I can record the video from the device but it takes my voice for recording with the video, What I am trying to do is to record it with the audio clip playing on the device.
[14:10:29] <NoiseEee> aftab: i don't think you have that much control over the hardware if you're trying to make an app via JS/jquery etc.
[14:11:21] <Cork> R-Ratones: if you mean the element names, well you're creating a bunch of invalid tags in html
[14:11:29] <Cork> so you get html error correction on those
[14:11:39] <Cork> but i don't see any change on the CDATA sections
[14:12:12] <R-Ratones> Cork are you on linux/firefox linux/chrome ?
[14:12:22] <Cork> ya
[14:13:50] <R-Ratones> Cork and you do not see the    changes from <a_node><![CDATA[SOME TEXT]]></a_node>   to   <a_node><!--[CDATA[SOME TEXT]]--></a_node> on the alert?
[14:14:19] <Cork> R-Ratones: ya, and that is how html do comments

[14:21:39] <aftab> NoiseEee: sorry i got disconnected, I must have missed your reply.
[14:21:41] <aftab> NoiseEee: Yes it will be a native app, I can record the video from the device but it takes my voice for recording with the video, What I am trying to do is to record it with the audio clip playing on the device.
[14:22:51] <NoiseEee> aftab: i don't think you have that much control over the hardware if you're trying to make an app via JS/jquery etc.
[14:24:38] <aftab> NoiseEee: Ok, so the best idea is to record the video with the audio and edit it on the server right? I thought it can be done directly from the app but now I will have to upload the recorded video to the server and extract audio from it and merge it with another audio clip.
[14:24:45] <aftab> Thank you for the answer :)
[14:27:47] <rn10950> Is there a way to disable onClick for a child element of a parent that has it?
[14:29:46] <jphase> rn10950: look up .stopPropagation()
[14:30:22] <Cork> its better to have the parent check where the event come from
[14:30:37] <Cork> stopPropagation is something you should avoid as much as possible
[14:30:46] <Cork> (read never use)
[14:33:00] <rn10950> how do I have the parent check where the event came from?
[14:34:02] <Cork> rn10950: $(event.target).closest('selector matching the element you want to avoid')
[14:34:07] <Cork> opps
[14:34:14] <Cork> rn10950: $(event.target).closest('selector matching the element you want to avoid').length > 0
[14:39:37] <rn10950> Cork: I have no idea what you mean, but here's a jsfiddle to try to demonstrate what I mean to see if we're on the same page (read comment in js section) https://jsfiddle.net/1t7tqewy/
[14:41:13] <Cork> rn10950: https://jsfiddle.net/1t7tqewy/1/
[14:42:35] <rn10950> thank you, I thought by event.target I actually had to do something like $(click."#parent")
[14:43:00] <rn10950> or $(click."#child1")
[14:43:18] <Cork> that doesn't even parse
[14:43:28] <Cork> you can't write variable.""
[14:43:31] <rn10950> i know that's why I was skeptical
[14:43:35] <Cork> :)
[14:44:22] <Cork> to explain why you should avoide stopPropagation
[14:44:40] <Cork> stopPropagation/stopImideatePropagation/return false
[14:45:03] <Cork> all makes a statement that you have a _VERY_ hard time actually guaranteeing
[14:45:28] <Cork> "no one will ever want to have this even beside me for the rest of eternity"
[14:45:36] <Cork> even==event
[14:46:03] <Cork> and that means that when a new feature gets added to the page 2 years down the line
[14:46:21] <Cork> it has a risk of getting buggy cause your script kills an event that it sometimes need
[14:46:48] <Cork> so, the better solution is to specifically handle the case in the event handler that want to exclude something
[14:47:01] <Cork> cause that becomes local to that handler, and easy to debug
[14:47:14] <Cork> and doesn't make any assumptions at all
[14:51:57] <SuperTyp> I want to send data to a php script (login), where I throw exceptions, I want to handle these exceptions with jquery for displaying it in a nice way. How can I handle these exceptions?
[14:52:09] <rn10950> Cork: that makes a lot of sense as I am working on a CSS/JS/HTML (HTML5) rich webapp that is being changed every day
[14:52:17] <garethdaine> Does detach() not work on nested elements?
[14:53:06] <SuperTyp> and: I use .done() to handle the data after the ajax, shell I use .fail(), .success() instead?
[14:53:09] <R-Ratones> i think this fixes my xml issue http://jsfiddle.net/b5zxdhmL/1/
[15:11:41] <garethdaine> Any idea why wrapAll is duplicating the first element wrapped?
[15:12:47] <garethdaine> Using this http://kopy.io/wELa7
[15:47:08] <acidjazz> wrapJimmy
[15:48:10] <forQuery> does anyone have an idea how i could rewrite https://jsfiddle.net/bz443pra/ so it did not use inline event handlers?
[15:48:30] <forQuery> with inline it works great.... when i try to use event delegation it will select all on click, instead of selecting one on click
[15:48:53] <forQuery> it has somethign to do with the php loop but, i could not find soltuion to use a .on() event instead of onclick=""
[16:09:49] <billybob00> how can I find an child element by matching its ID?
[16:10:16] <forQuery> what do you mean?
[16:10:18] <Cork> billybob00: $('#the-id') ?
[16:10:19] <billybob00> e.g. something along the lines of --   $(".suite-meta-data")[0].children("#suite-uuid")
[16:10:39] <Cork> billybob00: ids are always unique so just use it straight of
[16:10:58] <forQuery> $('#id').find('.child');
[16:11:01] <billybob00> well i'm selecting its parent for a reason
[16:11:18] <Cork> billybob00: do you have more then one element with the same id?=
[16:11:32] <forQuery> i dont understand what you're asking for, myself...
[16:11:38] <billybob00> well, I'm selecting all elements with a given class
[16:11:51] <billybob00> $(".suite-meta-data")
[16:12:01] <Cork> billybob00: $('[id="the-id"]').length gives you what?
[16:12:09] <forQuery> yes that is slow... first select the parent id then use .find()
[16:12:19] <Cork> billybob00: nothing can't ever be more specific then an id
[16:12:22] <Cork> so no need for the class
[16:12:26] <Cork> uh...
[16:12:30] <Cork> *nothing can ever*
[16:12:51] <forQuery> but, id's do not have to be unique...
[16:12:59] <Cork> they do
[16:13:31] <Cork> you have an error in your document if you ever have more then one element with the same id
[16:13:40] <forQuery> or else, how can you use <label for="id"> <input id="id"> when you have this in a template that is added many times
[16:13:43] <Cork> that is why it is called id
[16:13:51] <robertmaxrees> forQuery you can't.
[16:13:54] <Cork> forQuery: you can't
[16:14:02] <forQuery> but what if you do and works fine?
[16:14:10] <robertmaxrees> it's invalid.
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> it technically DOESN'T "work fine"
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> things break.
[16:14:17] <Cork> forQuery: then it works cause you aren't using hte id
[16:14:21] <forQuery> invalid yes... but it doesnt give errors
[16:14:29] <forQuery> sure, i use the id.  just not as a direct selector
[16:14:35] <Cork> forQuery: no error as in a console log error sure
[16:14:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't reliably use the ID.
[16:14:47] <Cork> but the browser ignores the later id declarations
[16:14:51] <robertmaxrees> but your code is not valid.  period.  now the browser is trying to guess what you mean.
[16:15:02] <forQuery> yes, you have to select parent.find('#id')
[16:15:04] <Cork> only the first occurance of an id exists
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[16:15:11] <Cork> the later is ignored by the browser
[16:15:25] <Cork> forQuery: but that is a workaround for a broken page
[16:15:41] <Cork> forQuery: if you plan to use the same identifyer multiple times in a page use a class
[16:15:46] <forQuery> cant use a class
[16:15:53] <forQuery> becuase you cant use <label for="class"> wont work
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[16:15:59] <robertmaxrees> names.
[16:16:08] <robertmaxrees> or wrap the label around the input.
[16:16:19] <forQuery> yes
[16:16:58] <Cork> forQuery: label for can only work for one element
[16:17:13] <Cork> so having multiple elements with the same id still doesn't make any sense
[16:17:38] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[16:17:49] <Cork> and ya, you need an id for for=""
[16:17:59] <Cork> it doesn't work with the name attribute
[16:18:22] <Cork> but <label for="a">label</label><input id="a"><input id="a">
[16:18:29] <Cork> only works for the first input field anyway
[16:18:38] <robertmaxrees> or just wrap the label around the input
[16:18:59] <forQuery> no it works for all the correct inputs but, im going to wrap per robertmaxress and use a c lass
[16:19:03] <Cork> that doesn't work if you want to have the label affected by the state of the input though
[16:19:26] <robertmaxrees> Cork you sure?
[16:19:30] <Cork> yes
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> weird
[16:19:50] <robertmaxrees> i so rarely use that sort of stuff - i just count on being able to click the label.
[16:19:58] <Cork> try to style this label: <label><input type="checkbox"> check</label>
[16:20:06] <Cork> based on if the input is :checked
[16:20:14] <forQuery> i have a page right now with 10 templates on it, all which have the same id for their input fields, and the for works fine and the id works fine...  but, wrapping the label should work instead.
[16:20:21] <Cork> hint: not possible
[16:20:34] <deltacentauri> i'm having trouble with grids in jquery mobile, i get some strange artifacts in the markup, a heap of
[16:20:34] <deltacentauri> Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ get inserted, even when i copy the markup directly from the documentation.
[16:20:35] <deltacentauri> http://ibin.co/22JYyZnXmWUR shows error.  can anybody shed some light on this for me?
[16:20:47] <Cork> while this is easy: <input id="a" type="checkbox"> <label for="a">check</label>
[16:43:58] <Cork> lnr: fix your freaking connection...
[16:48:47] <acidjazz> i made a thingy http://codepen.io/acidjazz/pen/VLjJye?editors=110
[17:16:35] <mod55> Hi I have a problem with jquery resizable, I don't know if it's a bug or not, this is the link to my question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30332817/jquery-ui-resizable-cant-expand-elements-to-the-left-or-the-top
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> mod55 the margin.
[17:18:41] <mod55> robertmaxrees what do you mean by the margin
[17:18:52] <robertmaxrees> the margin of the h1
[17:19:15] <robertmaxrees> basically, your margins are bumping agianst each other.
[17:19:25] <robertmaxrees> remove the containment option and you'll see what i mean.
[17:20:15] <acidjazz> sounds like a fat joke robertmaxrees
[17:20:22] <robertmaxrees> heh.,...
[17:20:33] <acidjazz> did you see my spionner
[17:20:35] <acidjazz> spinner
[17:20:39] <acidjazz> duplciated android material
[17:21:05] <robertmaxrees> looked funky in ff.
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> chrome looks good though.
[17:21:32] <mod55> robertmaxrees it's not a problem of margin, even if I set margin to 0px it won't expand to the left or top, you can try it and see
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> mod55 right, because it's contained by yout limit.
[17:22:04] <robertmaxrees> *your
[17:23:07] <mod55> robertmaxrees my limit is the yellow div not the orange, but why it's blocked inside the orange ? the resize to the right and bottom works fine !
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> right, your margins and paddings are your issue.
[17:25:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s0yo16ek/7/ with a modified version of their example.
[17:26:36] <mod55> robertmaxrees if margins and padding are the issue why it works when I resize to the right !
[17:27:25] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't.
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> looks like it might not be calculating things correctly, because it can only go so far.
[17:29:20] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/dpp0DX1.png
[17:29:22] <mod55> robertmaxrees if I don't set containment it works fine, but I need to set a limit within the yellow area
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> mod55 dunno what to tell you.
[17:31:14] <mod55> robertmaxrees oh yeah I didn't noticed that it breaks for the right side !! is that a bug or what ?
[17:31:25] <robertmaxrees> might be?
[17:31:33] <robertmaxrees> that seems like an old version of jqui.
[17:32:34] <mod55> v1.11.4
[17:32:47] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle has an old version at least.  feel free to submit a bug report.
[17:34:06] <mod55> I already tried it in my local computer, it has the same issue :(
[17:34:38] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[17:34:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:34:48] <billybob00> once I find my element using ".find()", how do I tend modify its HTML content?
[17:35:00] <billybob00> tend = "then"
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> .html()
[17:35:19] <robertmaxrees> .find('.something').html('<span>butts</span>')
[17:35:33] <billybob00> TypeError: undefined is not a function
[17:35:36] <mod55> robertmaxrees thank you for your help :)
[17:35:57] <robertmaxrees> billybob00 make a fiddle then.
[17:36:03] <billybob00> oh my bad
[17:36:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:36:19] <billybob00> i was accessing it using the direct index
[17:36:24] <robertmaxrees> oh..
[17:36:25] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[17:38:53] <mod55> robertmaxrees for my local experiment it doesn't break the right limit
[17:39:07] <robertmaxrees> mod55 well then there you go.
[17:39:55] <mod55> robertmaxrees but the initial issue still there lol
[17:40:08] <robertmaxrees> mod55 i'm not going to repeat myself.
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're hitting the constraints of the container and the element.
[17:40:30] <robertmaxrees> they are, in fact, contacting each other.
[20:02:35] <ISmithers> When specifying rules for the jquery validate function is there a functional difference between "key" and "key[]" other than being different strings?

[21:39:18] <dbriggs> Anyone help me with selector question?
[21:39:55] <Uhkis> dbriggs: no, unless you actually ask
[21:40:24] <dbriggs> Fair enough
[21:40:55] <dbriggs> OK, hold on, thought I had thw source ready.
[21:42:48] <dbriggs> OK, I have an input box. I am trying to get it by it's name. but not working .

[21:45:50] <dbriggs> And $('input#user_name') returns an empty array.
[21:48:17] <bigmac> im looking for some help with a small image gallery
[21:48:25] <bigmac> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/count.html
[21:48:29] <bigmac> i found this example
[21:48:44] <bigmac> a image fades to the next, with caption
[21:48:50] <Uhkis> dbriggs: $('input[name="user_name"]')
[21:49:30] <bigmac> <img src="images/beach4.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="this tittle"/>
[21:49:51] <bigmac> im not sure how to display the title under each image
[21:49:51] <dbriggs> Tried that, but with the quotes reversed. Hold on, I will try it your way.
[21:50:29] <dbriggs> @Uhkis: You are a genious, in addition to your snarky repartuae. Thank you, sir.
[22:23:21] <Mr_Moon> bigmac: you can't just use the title of the image... you'll need a separate element with the content of the image in it.
[22:24:09] <Mr_Moon> out of the box, jquery cycle just creates slides of images... but there's docs to make it use whatever child element you want.
[22:24:53] <Mr_Moon> also... you should be using http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/ - it's newer and waaaay less javascript intensive. you can use most of it's features just by writing the correct markup.
[22:25:04] <Mr_Moon> i.e. YOU don't have to write as much js
[22:26:32] <Mr_Moon> also: I've not used this - I recommended it to a mate who uses it on his production site and totally loves it.  http://photoswipe.com/
[22:27:05] <pauled> Hi, can you tell me what mean line 29 in http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/5c95jzpa/
[22:27:26] <pauled>  /black/i.test(main_player_table.attr("class"))
[22:28:42] <pauled>  /black/i it's a regexp?
[22:30:04] <Uhkis> pauled: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[22:30:29] <pauled> thanks
[22:31:42] <pauled> tried to search .test() but unfortunately no result https://duckduckgo.com/?q=js+jquery+javascript+%22.test%28%29%22
[22:33:47] <pauled> why it use regex here and not just a if $(".black")
[22:34:09] <Uhkis> ask the author
[22:35:12] <bigmac> Mr_Moon: can you provide a example? alt='sometext'
[22:38:58] <Mr_Moon> Bigmac - am on mobile so not really. Have used jquery cycle many times tho. Follow the docs. It's simple as.
[22:41:46] <pauled> wow Mr_Moon very nice site gallery
[22:41:57] <pauled> photoswipe
[22:44:11] <Mr_Moon> Sweet huh?
[22:44:42] <Mr_Moon> http://shnappy.com uses it

[23:39:30] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/jemadu/16/ line 65 I just need someone to tell me please if the syntax of the ternary operator there is OK
[23:40:37] <Uhkis> line 65 is empty
[23:43:16] <dimi1947> dont you see this there.... hiddenDays:clos=(typeof clos!=='undefined')?clos:[]
[23:43:33] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/jemadu/16/
[23:46:53] <Cork> dimi1947: i would avoid it if nothing else
[23:47:10] <dimi1947> why do you say that?
[23:47:19] <Cork> also where is clos comming from?
[23:47:53] <Cork> (man i hate jsbin...)
[23:48:30] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/jemadu/17/ line 10...clos is a global variable and I am trying to "catch" the case where it is undefined
[23:49:04] <dimi1947> sorry for that....I had set up the code there more than 2 months a go
[23:49:06] <Cork> then 1. i would recommend using window.clos
[23:49:10] <Cork> to make it more readable
[23:49:14] <ISmithers> Can anyone tell me if this is incorrect somewhere: http://pastie.org/10198007 It isn't firing, but looking at the documentation it looks right to me. So I need another set of eyes.
[23:49:41] <Cork> dimi1947: and then you could just do hiddenDays: window.clos || [],
[23:49:57] <Cork> that would make it a lot more readable
[23:49:59] <Uhkis> ?mdn window.clos
[23:50:14] <Uhkis> oh bot is totally dead
[23:51:19] <Cork> i had to re read that line 3-4 times before i was sure what i meant to do
[23:51:28] <Cork> and that is a bad sign for a solution
[23:54:10] <dimi1947> ok.....thanks...I will try and tell you.
[23:55:11] <ISmithers> Can anyone who is familiar with jquery validation see a mistake in my code http://pastie.org/10198007 ?
