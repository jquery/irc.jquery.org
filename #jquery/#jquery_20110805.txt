[00:00:18] <krystophv> bricker: if the logic on line 13 is true, then keypress will return false which, as far as I can tell, will prevent the default action of the event
[00:02:23] <bricker> krystophv:
[00:02:29] <bricker> hey, that worked
[00:02:39] <bricker> so now I have two follow up questions:
[00:02:47] <bricker> actually just one
[00:03:25] <bricker> I changed that line to ($…).removeClass('disabled').addClass('disabled');
[00:03:35] <bricker> is that the best way to do that?
[00:04:04] <bricker> seems bad to remove a class and then add back the same class
[00:04:16] <bricker> immediately after
[00:04:39] <bricker> thanks for the response, by the way
[00:06:01] <krystophv> no problem. I'm trying to figure out what you're trying to prevent with  the 'disabled'. it seems like the whole of like 13 would be unnecessary.
[00:06:18] <krystophv> *line 13
[00:10:19] <taky_> hey friends
[00:10:35] <taky_> i was wondering if there is a way to detect if top is about to change and change it to another location if so
[00:10:47] <taky_> for instance i have a form submitting inside an iframe on a third party domain that submits into _top
[00:11:01] <taky_> i need the js on the parent page which i control to see its trying to be redirected and instead goto say, google.com
[00:11:15] <taky_> it seems like the only functions js responds to under that situation is alert and confirm calls
[00:11:34] <Innocentus> well, you a server sided approach could be the solution
[00:11:47] <taky_> is it a security measure that i'm messing with inside of javascript itself that won't allow that to happen or is it that i'm just not using some native function i should know about
[00:11:48] <Innocentus> Script A is sending the form data and is polling Script B which waits for it for processing
[00:12:08] <Innocentus> taky_: so both scripts are on two different domains / servers, right?
[00:12:35] <taky_> correct, the inline frame is on another domain that i don't have control over, its posting data to it's own domain into _top
[00:12:38] <taky_> i have control of _top
[00:12:41] <taky_> obviously
[00:12:54] <Innocentus> taky_: here we go: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175006/javascript-permission-denied-how-to-allow-cross-domain-scripting-between-trusted
[00:13:04] <Innocentus> scroll a little bit down and you will see the answer
[00:13:07] <taky_> one sec and ill check it
[00:13:38] <Innocentus> taky_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175006/javascript-permission-denied-how-to-allow-cross-domain-scripting-between-trusted
[00:13:40] <taky_> solution in document.domain?
[00:13:51] <taky_> i don't control the other domain though, so i can't add that property to their page
[00:13:57] <Innocentus> aha
[00:14:21] <taky_> i am usually a javascript ninja here i was thinking maybe to do something with the inline frame
[00:14:33] <taky_> like set a property on the iframe itself to say if it changes redirect the parent
[00:14:38] <taky_> hehe
[00:14:39] <Innocentus> taky_: and this one?: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/
[00:14:42] <Innocentus> taky_: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/
[00:14:53] <Innocentus> taky_: alternatively you could POST the stuff by the javascript itself
[00:15:07] <taky_> hehe innocent, let me pm you
[00:15:10] <Innocentus> taky_: or you put a serversided layer before the user and the external form
[00:15:10] <taky_> sort of some sensitive information
[00:15:12] <Innocentus> ok
[00:32:39] <gar_onn> is there a was to let jQuery set data to an element via .data('lol','lol') as data-lol and not as -data-lol ?
[00:40:16] <Erthe> Good morning.
[00:40:47] <Erthe> Does anyone know of a plugin that will format integers in a form field like 1,000,000?
[00:41:07] <Erthe> (As the user types that is.)
[00:41:44] <coldhead> try googling for jquery watermark plugin
[00:41:51] <coldhead> i've seen a few that do that
[00:42:01] <coldhead> sup watermark
[00:42:38] <beasty> sup coldhead
[00:42:42] <zn> $('#id_name.class_name').fadeIn(); why doesn't work?
[00:42:56] <Phil-Work> Erthe, php.js has a function to do it
[00:42:57] <Phil-Work> http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format:481
[00:43:14] <Phil-Work> it'd be fairly easy to do a .keypress event to format as the user types
[00:48:35] <RubyTN> I have the following code:  http://jsfiddle.net/7NRTc/2/, I just need to toggle the css on a div whe an input is checked.  What I have works when the entire div is clicked on, but I just need it to highlight when the checkbox is checked
[00:48:39] <RubyTN> any ideas?
[00:49:42] <rethus> i use the form-wizard-plugin. Each time i click "nest", the url is createt with parameter step= (1,2,3 and so on).
[00:49:55] <rethus> is there a way to ad one own parameter like submit=1
[00:49:56] <rethus> ?
[00:50:58] <nail_> RubyTN: select on '.files :checkbox' instead of '.files' then (and adapt the callback accordingly, like $(this).parent())
[00:51:41] <nail_> err, rather remove .children :)
[00:52:37] <coldhead> abortion?
[00:52:49] <beasty> haha
[00:52:57] <beasty> maybe a idea for a new function
[00:53:08] <beasty> .abortion() removes all the children
[00:53:09] <beasty> :p
[00:53:12] <beasty> brb
[00:53:50] <coldhead> did you see http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/funny-jquery-plugin-family-dom-tree
[00:53:59] <coldhead> might be a good extra for there
[00:54:01] <coldhead> also genocide
[00:55:39] <RubyTN> nail_:  the '.files :checkbox' works, but I no longer can get the toggling of the css to work, and ideas?  here is the updated fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/7NRTc/3/
[00:55:54] <coldhead> hey barratt
[00:56:00] <coldhead> BarryCarlyon* even
[00:56:16] <mvta> morning mates
[00:56:22] <sasori> help: what's wrong with my jquery? why am i getting the value 1, even if i ticked the the 0 value ? http://pastebin.com/yL0WUiFe :(
[00:57:02] <juha___> in jquery 1.4.2, was there issues with live function on older ie versions?
[00:57:32] <juha___> it seems that $("form").live("submit") does not work on older ie with that version, but $("form").submit() works.. weird
[01:00:39] <RubyTN> coldhead:  can you tell me why my toggleclass isn't working in conjunction with my $(".files :checkbox").click(function(){  : http://jsfiddle.net/7NRTc/3/
[01:06:41] <Derppy> Is it possible to measure the actual width of longest text line in p-element? Got a client with very strict design. I have to have images on both sides of p-element and the distance between the rightmost character and the image needs to be exact.
[01:07:32] <coldhead> juha___: i've never trusted live submit
[01:09:25] <bricker> I don't understand the different between keydown and keyup… it seems that repeating characters would be the only thing, however I get some weird behavior with keydown that doesn't exist with keyup (for example, I need to type two characters for the keydown method to be picked up in an input… works as expected with keyup)
[01:11:40] <juha___> coldhead: it seems that my trust for it is also gone
[01:12:00] <g0rd0n> i need an animated toilet to use for ajax loading stuff... anyone has any good ones?
[01:12:46] <juha___> :D
[01:12:57] <juha___> g0rd0n: let me call 1998 and ask if they have any
[01:13:22] <g0rd0n> the website logo contains a toilet :P
[01:14:54] <coldhead> RubyTN: http://jsfiddle.net/7NRTc/6/
[01:14:56] <coldhead> works for me
[01:16:01] <nielsnick> hey all. can someone tell me what is wrong with this line? I try to get the 'href' part of an link with id page15
[01:16:07] <nielsnick> var test = $(#page15).attr("href");
[01:16:24] <RubyTN> coldhead:  tnx
[01:17:52] <coldhead> nielsnick: you need to put quotes around '#page15'
[01:18:55] <jedrek> how would I go about accessing a div via a variable name? let's say I have an a div named 'c10', if i have a variable set to 10, can i access it by $("#c" + id)?
[01:19:54] <nielsnick> coldhead: thanks!
[01:20:12] <jedrek> i mean, other than that not working
[01:20:29] <sshaginyan> Is there a way I can get the user to specifically choose from the autocomplete options? I don't want the user input to be some random information
[01:20:50] <sshaginyan> http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/ Type a number in city or zip
[01:21:17] <jedrek> oh wait
[01:21:18] <jedrek> i'm dumb
[01:22:25] <sshaginyan> For example if I type "Nor" a list pops up below and I HAVE to choose an option and just can't leave the input box
[01:23:46] <Erthe> Does anyone know how to ensure that autoNumeric doesn't automatically add precision in input fields?
[01:26:58] <kasi> Hi, does anyone know a good plugin for image resizing on the client side? I want to have a popup where the user can resize his profile picture in, like on many social network sites etc…
[01:27:32] <rahmen> Hi! I have a a table of statistics. Can I, without server side code, get jquery to prompt an excel download? I've googled it and it looks bad, but I just want to make sure. Thanks!
[01:28:36] <Erthe> rahmen: You will need server side code.
[01:29:15] <Erthe> Either you send the header for excel and output an HTML table, or you have the server generate a file in docx format.
[01:29:58] <rahmen> Erthe: Ok, thanks! :)
[01:34:18] <philosophically> IE is the only browser not working with my jquery ajax load function.. trying to get around it using $.get but it doesnt seem to be working, can anyone take a looksy?
[01:35:01] <philosophically> getting null when using get for some reason..
[01:42:09] <philosophically> how do i load a $.get request for a specific #id on the page? i was using .load("http://blahblah.com/blah #idblah", function(blah blah blah... that was working fine, but the get just loads the html for the entire page
[01:53:42] <sshaginyan> Is there a mismatch event trigger in autocomplete?
[01:54:00] <sshaginyan> sorry mustMatch
[01:58:32] <philosophically> IE is the only browser not working with my jquery ajax load function.. trying to get around it using $.get but it doesnt seem to be working, can anyone take a looksy? mykazoo.tv - drag the slider to the new category
[01:59:52] <cypha> i'm trying to figure out what i did wrong here: http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[02:00:17] <cypha> i want forgot password to give me a modal window
[02:02:57] <nielsnick> hey all. is it possible to make php read a specific div and get the content as variable?
[02:04:08] <Hemebond> Can someone please tell me how to create an element, and then change an attribute using the returned pointer?
[02:05:37] <cherish> can someone tell me how to add a URL around an image src?
[02:05:54] <Hemebond> cherish: What do you mean?
[02:05:55] <quicksilver> Hemebond: $('<div/>').attr('id','blah');
[02:06:14] <quicksilver> cherish: $('img').wrap('<a href="blah"/>')
[02:06:20] <Hemebond> quicksilver: Hi, I need to change the attr using the pointer, e.g., this.playpause
[02:06:42] <cherish> I think its something to do we wrap.. but I have an image tag and I need to on hover add the URL..
[02:06:48] <cherish> thanks Quicksilver
[02:06:48] <quicksilver> Hemebond: what pointer?
[02:07:20] <Hemebond> Sorry, the Javascript variable that stores the jQuery object returned by e.g., your code above.
[02:07:48] <Hemebond> jQuery("<div/>") returns a jQuery object.
[02:07:59] <quicksilver> blah = $('<div\>'); blah.attr('id','barbar');
[02:08:14] <quicksilver> not \;)
[02:08:20] <quicksilver> that is, use / not \
[02:08:50] <Hemebond> Yeah, I'm trying that but it doesn't change.
[02:09:04] <cherish> <quicksilver> $('<img>').wrap('<a href=" "/>') is this right if I want to surround the image src with a href?
[02:09:52] <Hemebond> ah
[02:09:53] <Hemebond> Wait.
[02:10:14] <Hemebond> It looks like there might be a problem with my switch statement. Even though it runs fine.
[02:10:36] <cherish> <quicksilver> I am trying to initalise a plugin on hover which uses anchors and so I need the image src to be surrounded by the anchor.
[02:12:29] <Hemebond> Gah! I haven't used Javascript in so long. Thanks quicksilver, it was my switch statement that was faulty. My code was already changing the image correctly.
[02:12:44] <cherish> <quicksilver> I need it to add a class and then add the URL around the src..
[02:13:26] <cherish> <quicksilver> so on hover , add class and then add url.. , I think..
[02:13:46] <cherish> <quicksilver> would you be able to have a quick look and see what I am trying to achieve?
[02:14:28] <cherish> <quicksilver>: if I give you the URLs for my site and the plugin?
[02:15:11] <nielsnick> why do I get error for this?
[02:15:12] <nielsnick> <?php     $url1= ?> <script type = "text/javascript">     document.getElementById("urlpage15");		 </script> <?php     ; ?>
[02:15:31] <nielsnick> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ';'
[02:16:58] <Hemebond> nielsnick: Looks like a PHP error.
[02:17:07] <Hemebond> nielsnick: From your PHP code, I mean.
[02:17:39] <thyphus> nielsnick: i dont think that you load js like this in a php var
[02:17:53] <nielsnick> hmm..
[02:18:00] <thyphus> nielsnick: try to load a php file with the output
[02:18:09] <nielsnick> All I want is to read a div's content and put it in a var
[02:18:29] <thyphus> nielsnick: sth like .load("foobar.php?foo=" + document.getElementById("urlpage15"))
[02:18:54] <Hemebond> nielsnick: Into a PHP variable?
[02:19:03] <nielsnick> Hemebond: yep :)
[02:19:09] <Hemebond> nielsnick: You can't do it like that.
[02:19:14] <nielsnick> ahw :(
[02:19:26] <thyphus> Hemebond: like i said ;)
[02:20:32] <zay2> Hello. Im trying to find if element is already in dom. meaning that element is created or loaded from dom before check and i want to make sure in if, if its in dom or not. I found this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2218296/jquery-check-if-jquery-object-contains-exact-dom-element - but all these examples return false even if element is in dom. Basically $('body').find(el) does not equal to el when el already is jquery object
[02:20:49] <nielsnick> thyphus: I don't understand your example
[02:20:52] <nielsnick> .load?
[02:21:01] <nielsnick> I don't need to load external file
[02:21:06] <nielsnick> just from the html content a specific div :)
[02:21:14] <nielsnick> and put the div content inside var
[02:21:25] <Erthe> Client side scripting is not server side scripting.
[02:21:30] <Hemebond> nielsnick: He's talking about sending a GET or POST request to your server and using PHP to grab the value.
[02:21:33] <Erthe> You'd have to use ajax
[02:21:52] <Hemebond> zay2: Has your document finished loading before you try to get the element?
[02:22:04] <zay2> @hemebond yes
[02:22:16] <Hemebond> Got a link to a live page?
[02:22:24] <nielsnick> Hemebond: hm
[02:22:27] <zay2> @hemebond no
[02:22:45] <nielsnick> Hemebond: how about php getelementbyid?
[02:23:01] <zay2> whats that page to create live js examples and test cases?
[02:23:05] <Hemebond> nielsnick: No. PHP and Javascript can not interact directly.
[02:23:23] <nielsnick> Hemebond: then what is this about? http://www.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.getelementbyid.php
[02:23:35] <Hemebond> nielsnick: You need to make a request to your server and capture it with a PHP script. Like you would when submitting a form to PHP.
[02:23:45] <thyphus> nielsnick: this is DOM
[02:24:13] <nielsnick> Hemebond: thyphus: Alright. So something with GET and POST
[02:24:18] <Hemebond> nielsnick: You could load your HTML page into a PHP DOM object and then do that, yes.
[02:24:22] <nielsnick> just to get the content of a div? :(
[02:24:47] <Hemebond> nielsnick: It's not the same as fetching a DOM element that the client is seeing in their web browser.
[02:25:11] <thyphus> nielsnick: read sth about server- and clientside
[02:25:17] <wangdoo> I get this o/p    ,6.How to remove that comma
[02:25:34] <Hemebond> zay2: You could convert your DOMs to strings and compare them.
[02:25:47] <Hemebond> zay2: I'm assuming they will be identical.
[02:25:56] <peol> zay2: If you got the DOMElement, DOMElement.parentNode will be null if it's not inserted
[02:25:59] <zay2> @hemebond yeah i could do that. That was one option i was thinking about
[02:26:26] <wangdoo> Hemebond: I get this o/p    ,6.How to remove that comma
[02:27:03] <Hemebond> wangdoo: You get what?
[02:27:32] <Hemebond> nielsnick: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[02:28:07] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  how to remove that comma which is before 6
[02:28:33] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Is that a string or something? "o/p  ,6" ?
[02:28:34] <thyphus> Hemebond: i think thats the wrong way. he wants to load the div in a php var
[02:28:43] <thyphus> Hemebond: not some php in a js var
[02:29:10] <wangdoo> Hemebond: it is not a string ,i get x_6 as o/o,i splitted it and got o/p as ,6
[02:29:17] <Erthe> thyphus: It's still on either side of the request/response cycle.
[02:29:23] <Hemebond> thyphus: Using your example, he could do a GET request, capture it all in PHP, then ignore the returned value .
[02:29:24] <Erthe> thyphus: He needs to use AJAX
[02:29:41] <thyphus> Hemebond, Erthe: yes, sorry. you're right
[02:29:44] <Hemebond> thyphus: Depending on what he's actually doing, a POST request might be more appropriate.
[02:30:10] <zay2> @hemebond, @peol what i mean is : http://jsfiddle.net/PfuwN/ you can see that the element does not equal to itself if its found like that and it does not have parentNode... even though its in dom
[02:30:36] <wangdoo> Hemebond: got it??
[02:30:47] <Erthe> nielsnick: You can read the contents of the div with $('#divID').html() and then POST that value to the server with XHR
[02:31:05] <nielsnick> Hemebond: thanks for your help :) perhaps it clear things up if I tell why I need this
[02:31:10] <nielsnick> I got this php function
[02:31:11] <nielsnick> $link1 = "http://www.google.com/maps/place?source=uds&q=taxi&cid=12207139896564030224"; $html = file_get_html($link1);
[02:31:25] <nielsnick> now I need to make $link1 no longer hardcoded
[02:31:31] <nielsnick> but dependent on a jquery variable
[02:31:40] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I do not understand your question at all.
[02:31:42] <nielsnick> do i really need post/get for that?
[02:31:44] <peol> zay2: you need to differentiate between jQuery-wrapped DOMElements and plain DOMElements, $('li.error') will return a jQuery-wrapped object (to expose the API's), you can't use native properties on that, try $('li.error')[0] to get the real reference
[02:31:49] <Erthe> nielsnick: Yes, you do.
[02:31:58] <nielsnick> :-(
[02:32:00] <huglester> guys, how do I make this variable global, so I can access it from another function? $('a.fancy_notice').live('click', function() { var makeitglobal = $(this).attr('parent'); });
[02:32:06] <Erthe> nielsnick: JavaScript (and jQuery) executes in the browser.
[02:32:11] <Erthe> nielsnick: PHP executes on the server.
[02:32:20] <Erthe> nielsnick: To make them talk together you need to use AJAX
[02:32:52] <nielsnick> Erthe: alright, I guess I have to do that then
[02:32:53] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  eg: x_6 is a o/p.I used jquery split  like this variable.split("x_"),this gives o/p as ,6.I want to remove this 6
[02:32:55] <Hemebond> huglester: Declare it as a global variable (outside of all scopes) and then remove the "var" from that function.
[02:32:57] <peol> huglester: window.makeitglobal = <something>;
[02:33:02] <peol> huglester: not recommended though
[02:33:05] <nielsnick> Erthe: should I make a seperate .php file?
[02:33:07] <Hemebond> wangdoo: What is an o/p?
[02:33:20] <zay2> hmm yeah console.log(parent.find(el)[0] === el[0]); returns true indeed
[02:33:35] <wangdoo> Hema output should be only 6,it should remove x_
[02:33:49] <huglester> Hemebond: WORKS! Thank you :)
[02:33:58] <Hemebond> wangdoo: o/p means output?
[02:34:00] <Erthe> nielsnick: First, describe a bit more what you're trying to do.  You're trying to pass a google maps URL to a function that will read the HTML result from google maps?
[02:34:11] <huglester> peol: thanks for idea :), Hemebond's solution worked:))
[02:34:25] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  yes
[02:34:41] <nielsnick> Erthe: Yes that is right. The google maps URL should be variable, and I got it in a jQuery variable at the moment. Now I only need to convert this jQuery var to a PHP var
[02:34:46] <peol> huglester: yeah, you *should* declare it outside the scope, but 'true' global is the global namespace (window)
[02:34:52] <peol> just technicalities i guess
[02:35:19] <wangdoo> Hemebond: Did you under stand my problem?
[02:35:22] <Erthe> nielsnick: OK, then you'll have to do an AJAX request.
[02:35:39] <huglester> peol: understood.thanks for clarification:)
[02:35:55] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Not really. You have a string "x_6" and you want to remove the "6"?
[02:36:07] <nielsnick> Erthe: Alright. Should I start with an extra php file?
[02:36:15] <Erthe> I would, yes.
[02:36:19] <Erthe> Look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:36:19] <wangdoo> Hemebond: i want to remove x and underscore
[02:36:46] <Erthe> Essentially you want to POST the URL the user inputs to that script and return HTML.
[02:36:51] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Will the output always be that? Will it always be a certain format?
[02:37:37] <nielsnick> Erthe: $.ajax({    type: "POST",    url: "testajax.php",    data: "urlpage15",    success: function(msg){      alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );    }  });
[02:37:45] <nielsnick> now what do I put in the testajax.php?
[02:38:15] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  ouput will be x underscore and any number
[02:38:26] <_ramo> hi
[02:38:27] <Hemebond> wangdoo: And you want the number? Okay, just a sec.
[02:38:49] <wangdoo> Hemebond: yes.
[02:38:52] <Erthe> It should be: data: "urlpage15=http://www.someurl.com/"
[02:39:07] <Erthe> I think the data property will take JSON too, maybe someone can confirm?
[02:39:09] <nielsnick> Erthe: but the urlpage15 is a variable
[02:39:09] <_ramo> are there any suggestions for building modal dialogs with jquery? I would like to have a modal login dialog
[02:39:19] <nielsnick> that already contains an url
[02:39:24] <Erthe> nielsnick: Yes, but you're going to have to specify the key/value
[02:39:48] <nielsnick> Erthe: how do I get this key/value out of the variable then? :s
[02:39:57] <Erthe> data: "urlpage15":$('#myURLInput').val();
[02:40:23] <Erthe> Well, once you're passing it correctly with the data property, you'll just use $_POST['urlpage15']
[02:40:56] <peol> _ramo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[02:41:09] <peol> _ramo: click on "Create user" and you'll get the idea
[02:41:15] <Erthe> nielsnick: Is someone inputting this into a form?
[02:41:26] <nielsnick> Erthe: nope it;s not a form
[02:41:32] <_ramo> peol: yeah, thank you!
[02:41:44] <_ramo> peol: can i extend this dialog how i want?
[02:41:52] <nielsnick> inside the php tag, I just add 'echo $_POST['urlpage15']?
[02:41:52] <Erthe> nielsnick: Where does the URL come from?
[02:42:15] <nielsnick> Erthe: I get it dynamicly from Google Maps
[02:42:17] <Hemebond> wangdoo: var t = "x_6"; t.match(/\d+/g);
[02:42:20] <_ramo> very cool, thank you!
[02:42:28] <peol> _ramo: extend it how? it's in jquery ui so you can define the theme etc. in its css
[02:42:33] <nielsnick> Erthe: like this: 	document.getElementById('urlpage15').innerHTML = urlpage15;
[02:42:48] <nielsnick> Erthe: this I mean: 	var urlpage15 = $("#page15").attr("href");
[02:43:23] <Erthe> I think I'd have to know more about what you're doing.
[02:45:32] <_ramo> peol: i meant the functionality... but i'll look at the code...
[02:46:04] <peol> _ramo: yeah, it's pretty extendable, look at the source code on github
[02:46:14] <_ramo> is there any possibiliy, to create a slider effect with pictures with jquery? i mean have next and previous arrows and slide horizontally through this picutres
[02:47:18] <peol> _ramo: there's literally thousands of those plugins, just google jquery slider plugin
[02:47:20] <peol> _ramo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js
[02:47:43] <peol> _ramo: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/ is a pretty decent one, for example
[02:50:10] <_ramo1> peol: may i mean more horizontal scrolling... it's hard for me to find the right names for this functionalities...
[02:50:22] <boyka> hi there guys
[02:50:25] <_ramo1> but yeah, i've try to search more....
[02:50:26] <boyka> just to report you
[02:50:35] <boyka> that when you do something like this:
[02:50:48] <peol> _ramo1: http://cl.ly/1E3C251L0P0R1U0h0p1y
[02:50:56] <boyka> $( $ ); or $( $( $ ) ); - will do harm to your browser
[02:51:05] <boyka> will start a recursion and block everything
[02:51:33] <bastl> hi im trying to load content with javascript/jquery on condition: while $(document).height() <= $(window).height(). If this is true i insert content in my page but the loop goes infinite because both heights stay at the initial values. how can i make jquery reload the dom?
[02:52:13] <peol> boyka: If you think you found a bug, please report it to bugs.jquery.com
[02:52:28] <boyka> thank you dog
[02:52:38] <boyka> @peol, are you in the development team of jquery?
[02:52:42] <boyka> just for the record
[02:52:42] <boyka> :)
[02:52:43] <_ramo1> peol: yeah! but i guess it would be cooler to have the previous or next pictures in an more opaque view on the right or left position of the central image..
[02:53:08] <_ramo1> as opaque previous, or something like that...
[02:53:14] <peol> _ramo1: ah, it's definitely doable, but you might need to roll your own
[02:53:19] <peol> boyka: nope
[02:53:59] <_ramo1> peol: okay, cool, thank you for the help mate!
[02:54:01] <peol> boyka: there are only a few committers, but the community is the dev team, really
[02:57:26] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  how to use if loop in this case    $("").live('click',function()
[02:57:56] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Within the function(){}
[02:58:25] <wangdoo> Hemebond: if loop for both selector + function
[02:58:35] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Wait... where are you wanting to put... oh.
[02:58:54] <wangdoo> Hemebond: can i use like this    if( $("").live('click',function())
[03:00:27] <Hemebond> wangdoo: That doesn't seem correct...
[03:00:41] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Tell me what it is you are trying to do.
[03:00:46] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  then how to use in that case?
[03:01:37] <wangdoo> Hemebond: I have some results,results are in row and column,in one particular column,i allow user to add tags
[03:02:19] <Hemebond> wangdoo: An HTML table?
[03:02:36] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  yes
[03:03:31] <Hemebond> wangdoo: So you have cells within that table that you want to attach an onClick event listener?
[03:03:32] <wangdoo> Hemebond: same like this plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/tags
[03:03:58] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  yes but i want tr id and td id
[03:04:54] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Well, the event you capture contains a reference to the table cell that triggered the event.
[03:05:17] <Hemebond> wangdoo: You just need to go up the DOM tree to get the TR and its ID.
[03:05:23] <boyka> nice nice
[03:05:28] <boyka> I like jquery
[03:05:35] <boyka> more than javascript itself :P
[03:05:45] <Hemebond> wangdoo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Event
[03:05:59] <wangdoo> Hemebond: there are some x columns,if user click on second column,he can add tag
[03:06:23] <wangdoo> Hemebond: IF SECOND COLUMN + CLICK EVENT DO SOME THING
[03:06:38] <wangdoo> Hemebond HOW TO DO THIS
[03:07:02] <Hemebond> wangdoo: These cells should have a class or something that indicates they can be edited. Then you use that class as the selector to attach the event listener.
[03:07:37] <wangdoo> Hemebond: have all those things but how to put if loop,tell me
[03:08:00] <Hemebond> wangdoo: The same class? Put the same class on each of the cells.
[03:08:32] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Then do $(".myclass").live('click', function(){/*my code here*/});
[03:09:12] <bricker> is the effects library built-in with jquery, or a separate thing I need to install? I'm trying to get the highlight effect to work
[03:10:17] <fbdevuser> I have screenshot file data url. ho can i post it as a file to server ?
[03:10:22] <peol> bricker: the highlight effect is built-in in jquery-ui afaik
[03:11:31] <bricker> I have jquery.js, jquery-min.js, and jquery_ujs.js…. should the highlight effect work?
[03:12:25] <wangdoo> Hemebond: for above case how to use if condition
[03:12:55] <peol> fbdevuser: you should just be able to POST it to your php page or whatever, and save it there
[03:12:58] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Why do you need an IF condition? The $(".myclass") will attach to any element with the class "myclass".
[03:13:35] <peol> fbdevuser: most important part is to POST it as content-type application/upload
[03:14:06] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  i m compring tr id and td id
[03:14:22] <fbdevuser> peol, hoc can i specify this content type ?
[03:14:26] <peol> fbdevuser: and then decode it server-side with base64, see here http://www.permadi.com/blog/2010/10/html5-saving-canvas-image-data-using-php-and-ajax/#viewSource
[03:14:27] <wangdoo> Hemebond: pls,tell how to use if condition in that case or i can not use it
[03:14:57] <Hemebond> wangdoo: The table cells don't have a class that identifies them as editable?
[03:15:03] <fbdevuser> when i pass my file as parameter i receive it in $_POST, but i need to receive it in $_FILES
[03:15:12] <peol> fbdevuser: $.ajax({ contentType: 'application/upload', ….. })
[03:15:26] <logik-bomb> Hi all. I'm looking for a highly customizable carousel/scroll plugin/lib for jQuery. Any sugestions? I'm currently using serialScroll. Thank you
[03:15:32] <wangdoo> Hemebond: I use a plug in for that but you are not giving solu for my problem
[03:16:05] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I don't understand what your problem is.
[03:16:35] <fbdevuser> peol thanks a lot for link
[03:16:47] <Hemebond> wangdoo: You say you have cells you want them to click on. These cells must be identifiable. The easiest way to identify them would be to add a class to them.
[03:17:11] <Hemebond> wangdoo: If they have a class, attaching the event listener is easy.
[03:19:14] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  The problem is,if i use that,id is hardcoded,if i click one row,all rows are getting editable
[03:19:26] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Class is not ID.
[03:19:40] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Any number of elements can have the same class.
[03:20:13] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  I'm using id.If i click on one row,that should be editable,not all rows.id is hardcoded
[03:20:31] <seutje> funky, adding a tabindex of 0 to child elements of a contenteditable causes focusin to fire twice
[03:21:00] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Is your code live somewhere I can see?
[03:21:14] <philosophically> ie8 is not working well with my .load()... can anyone please take a  look at mykazoo.tv drag the left side scroller to "new" ... please and thank you :)
[03:23:08] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  nope
[03:23:37] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  my question to you is why if condition can n't be used in that case?
[03:24:19] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Well I'm afraid I still don't understand what it is you are trying to do. I can't explain how to use an IF statement if I don't know what it is you are trying to achieve.
[03:25:09] <Hemebond> wangdoo: If you want to, you could post some code at http://jsfiddle.net
[03:26:52] <pif> hi, I have this function wich works fine on 1.5.1 but not always on 1.6.2 (line 61 and after fails to execute), any idea?  http://pastie.org/2324554
[03:26:56] <Hemebond> Can jQuery do synchronous fetches?
[03:27:16] <pif> the data is loaded on the page but still invisible
[03:27:51] <Hemebond> nvm, found it.
[03:31:20] <wangdoo> Hemebond What did you find?
[03:31:45] <Hemebond> wangdoo: The answer to my question about synchronous ajax requests.
[03:32:31] <wangdoo> Hemebond: okay,thanks for helping me with that trim comma solution
[03:32:50] <quicksilver> synchronous ajax.
[03:32:52] <quicksilver> sjax.
[03:33:36] <philosophically> ie8 is not working well with my .load()... getting 'null' is null or not an object error... all othe rbrowsers work fine... can anyone please take a  look at mykazoo.tv drag the left side scroller to "new" ... please and thank you :)
[03:33:43] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/HjHht/ <- chrome be acting funky!
[03:34:31] <seutje> seems to fire focusin before and after firing focus on the child element
[03:34:34] <pif> why would this not return?  $content.html(data);
[03:34:43] <pif> it's what's happening here
[03:35:56] <wangdoo> Hemebond: chk this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/8/ and can we make that one into this  http://projects.alicialiu.net/jquery-tagify-demo/
[03:37:01] <astropirate> I was actuall excieted to hear about kendoui until i found out it wasn't open source and would probably cost $$ in a few weeks :( :(
[03:38:15] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Are you using tagify?
[03:39:26] <nicolaes> any1 arount?
[03:39:35] <nicolaes> *around
[03:41:22] <nicolaes> anyone knows the best practice for managing variable groups of inputs?
[03:41:53] <Hemebond> nicolaes: What do you mean?
[03:42:21] <nicolaes> I have a Client form and I want to add more Assets in a single page
[03:43:13] <nicolaes> Hemebond: I'm new in jQ. I tried jQueryUI tabs, but it doesn't help too much...
[03:43:18] <Hemebond> nicolaes: Make a function to add them. You'll probably need something to track what you've added. Depends.
[03:44:37] <nicolaes> Hemebond: I was thinking about a select that adds/removes divs and changes their ID. how does that sound?
[03:45:00] <nicolaes> Hemebond: like when you click an option, the div is switched
[03:45:14] <Hemebond> nicolaes: Umm. Refactor your forms. Show/hide fieldsets or forms.
[03:45:59] <Hemebond> nicolaes: I don't know if jQuery provides anything to make that kind of thing painless; I'm new to it too.
[03:46:49] <nicolaes> Hemebond: It's painful no matter what I think.. but still, I don't want to die
[03:48:10] <nicolaes> Hemebond: show/hide - I think I have to use clone() in order to duplicate the inputs
[03:49:02] <wangdoo> Hemebond: yep
[03:50:00] <Hemebond> wangdoo: And you can not just put the textarea element into the cells and tagify them?
[03:51:19] <philosophically> ie8 is not working well with my .load()... getting 'null' is null or not an object error... all othe rbrowsers work fine... can anyone please take a  look at mykazoo.tv drag the left side scroller to "new"
[03:51:29] <wangdoo> Hemebond: how do i modify it?
[03:51:45] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Your HTML?
[03:51:58] <wangdoo> Hemebond: you saw a jsfiddle link,can we do it like tagify for that jsfiddle link
[03:52:15] <wangdoo> Hemebond: see my prev jsfiddle link
[03:52:30] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I'm on there now, testing and changing.
[03:53:46] <wangdoo> Hemebond: okay
[03:54:08] <wangdoo> Hemebond: same kind of css and delete functio
[03:55:40] <Hemebond> wangdoo: You want one tag per cell?
[03:55:55] <wangdoo> Hemebond: it can be n tags too
[03:58:25] <zay2> Can anyone explain me why el.html('testing').delay(2500).fadeOut(500); fades out element after 2500 ms but el.html('testing').delay(2500).fadeOut(500).remove(). does not - it removes it instantly? And how can i create delayed element removal?
[03:58:51] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I can't get tagify to work in that thing so I'm currently setting it up locally.
[03:59:31] <wangdoo> Hemebond: okay.
[03:59:42] <wangdoo> Hemebond: I mentioned tagify as an example
[03:59:54] <Hemebond> wangdoo:  An example?
[03:59:56] <wangdoo> Hemebond: not to use tagify itself
[04:00:03] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I asked if you were using it. You said yes.
[04:00:13] <wangdoo> Hemebond: you wanted to know what i want so,i gave that as example
[04:00:26] <Hemebond> wangdoo: If tagify is what you want, why not use tagify?
[04:00:26] <wangdoo> Hemebond: ofcourse yes that too
[04:00:42] <wangdoo> Hemebond: okay,we can use
[04:01:47] <zay2> Nm i found answer online :p
[04:01:57] <wangdoo> Hemebond:  how to modify it
[04:02:26] <philosophically> ie8 is not working well with my .load()... getting 'null' is null or not an object error... all othe rbrowsers work fine... can anyone please take a  look at mykazoo.tv drag the left side scroller to "new"
[04:03:11] <wangdoo> Hemebond: you there?
[04:03:18] <Hemebond> wangdoo: yip
[04:03:31] <wangdoo> Hemebond: how to do it?
[04:03:44] <Hemebond> wangdoo: How to set it up?
[04:03:53] <Hemebond> wangdoo: I'm doing it now. Seems pretty east.
[04:03:55] <Hemebond> *easy
[04:03:59] <wangdoo> Hemebond: ya,how to?
[04:04:12] <wangdoo> Hemebond: in my case,that is table
[04:05:40] <wangdoo> Hemebond: I'm waiting for your solution
[04:05:48] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Sure thing.
[04:07:59] <Hemebond> wangdoo: See the jsfiddle page.
[04:08:16] <wangdoo> Hemebond: link??
[04:08:26] <Hemebond> http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/27/
[04:09:14] <wangdoo> Hemebond: It is not working!
[04:09:28] <Hemebond> wangdoo: No, it won't in there.
[04:09:47] <wangdoo> Hemebond: then,should i do it from local
[04:10:08] <Hemebond> wangdoo: Yip. You'll need to download the tagify files and update the URLs in the HTML.
[04:10:11] <dabear> hi
[04:10:45] <dabear> how can I track down the slowest parts of my jquery code? e.g. so I can find out what should be optimized
[04:13:45] <Hemebond> dabear: jQuery.makeFaster(/* all code here */);
[04:14:27] <Hemebond> dabear: On a serious note, you might be able to use a Javascript profiler on your code.
[04:17:05] <wangdoo> Hemebond: What have you changed
[04:17:42] <Hemebond> wangdoo: What do you mean? I didn't really have to do anything. I just put the textarea into a cell and tagified it.
[04:18:01] <grid_> heya
[04:33:20] <brettgolding> Can someone take a look at my post over on the wordpress forum and see if you can help with the jQuery: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-wordpress-jparallax-incompatible-with-wordpress?replies=3
[04:34:08] <nielsnick> hey all, how comes '	var urlpage15 = $("#page15").attr("href"); ' returns [object HTMLDivElement] instead of an url?
[04:34:49] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Why are the URLs different on the script elements?
[04:35:15] <gp5st1> sorry if this isn't the place: $.tmpl how do i have a field that isn't escaped. so the field has html and that html isn't encoded to show up as &gt; for instance
[04:35:34] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Does wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); add the jQuery js file for you?
[04:36:32] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Is the page live somewhere?
[04:37:01] <gp5st1> {{html ? gonna check that
[04:37:25] <brettgolding> yes Hemebond
[04:37:34] <brettgolding> I have tried just calling in the jQuery with google as well
[04:37:38] <brettgolding> but still the same result
[04:37:43] <gp5st1> i don't think that's for the same template extetion i'm using.
[04:38:13] <nielsnick> Hemebond: how comes '	var urlpage15 = $("#page15").attr("href"); ' returns [object HTMLDivElement] instead of an url?
[04:39:42] <Hemebond> nielsnick: Not sure. I just tested and it worked fine for me.
[04:40:04] <Hemebond> nielsnick: You do know you can only have a href attribute on an A element, right?
[04:40:15] <nielsnick> yes :) i know that B)
[04:40:48] <Hemebond> nielsnick: And you have that ID (page15) on only one element?
[04:41:38] <RipX> hey, I just implemented this http://benalman.com/code/projects/php-simple-proxy/examples/simple/ on my server, I'm using it to query the Skype status system yet it seems to take a set time to refresh the status when I refresh. I think its some caching issue. Sorry to come in with questions, but is anyone able to give me any advice on how to turn off this system etc?
[04:42:26] <brettgolding> Any ideas? Hemebond?
[04:42:31] <nielsnick> Hemebond: yep
[04:42:40] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Is your page live somewhere? The broken page?
[04:42:53] <Hemebond> nielsnick: Are you sure? Can I see your code?
[04:43:00] <brettgolding> no its not im in the middle of the build on my local server
[04:43:14] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Are you able to paste the resulting HTML?
[04:43:27] <brettgolding> the source code
[04:43:28] <brettgolding> ?
[04:43:52] <hooloovoo> Bring us cooode!
[04:43:58] <logik-bomb> :D
[04:44:04] <Triluch> moar codez.
[04:44:09] <Hemebond> brettgolding: The HTML code. What your PHP code produces.
[04:44:12] <hooloovoo> Two of every code so we can have a sustainable society.
[04:44:19] <brettgolding> Here you go: http://pastebin.com/b56x7ny6
[04:45:56] <hooloovoo> brettgolding: Also what was your problem. I wasn't here when you asked =P
[04:46:07] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Any errors in your console?
[04:46:22] <brettgolding> Here you go hooloovoo: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-wordpress-jparallax-incompatible-with-wordpress?replies=3
[04:46:32] <philosophically> ie8 is not working well with my .load()... getting 'null' is null or not an object error... all othe rbrowsers work fine... can anyone please take a  look at mykazoo.tv drag the left side scroller to "new"
[04:46:45] <RipX> anyone?
[04:46:56] <brettgolding> I don't know how to check the console for errors Homebond
[04:47:25] <brettgolding> Apparently this is a common problem I have seen a post on the issue on the jQuery forum, and one on facebook however the soulution someone outlined on the post didn't help.
[04:47:46] <peol> RipX: i never used it and i think ben_alman is sleeping/heading for work atm
[04:49:18] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Using Firefox?
[04:49:24] <brettgolding> yes
[04:49:26] <RipX> Ahh...ok peol.. I've been struggling to make sence of it, I can't believe that there would be caching as default with it. I guess i'd expect it to be used alot for polled data fetching, As I am trying to achieve.
[04:49:28] <brettgolding> tested in safari as well
[04:49:51] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Firefox > Web Developer > Web Console
[04:50:13] <peol> RipX: Sure it's not jQuery caching it? try adding `cache: false` in your ajax options
[04:50:25] <AdTaylor> Does jQuery have a method to to bind change events (add, remove or change) to regular objects?
[04:50:31] <brettgolding> [12:50:26.633] The Web Console logging API (console.log, console.info, console.warn, console.error) has been disabled by a script on this page.
[04:50:47] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Refresh?
[04:51:49] <Hemebond> brettgolding: $j("#parallax").jparallax is not a function
[04:52:25] <RipX> ok cool... trying
[04:52:35] <brettgolding> I didn't write this script I just copied it from several tutorials
[04:52:36] <peol> AdTaylor: No, but there's ?see jquery data link
[04:52:41] <brettgolding> all used the same script to call it
[04:52:58] <brettgolding> and it works fine on my standard stripped down HTML version just not on my wordpress site
[04:53:54] <cerzi|work> hi all, how expensive is it to do lots of xhrs? i have a design problem and one solution would be to perform ~30 xhrs every time someone loads a certain page (basically querying server for 30 different elements one after the next). is that a bad idea?
[04:54:41] <brettgolding> Hemebond: [12:54:21.157] Error in parsing value for 'margin-top'.  Declaration dropped. @ http://localhost/mysite/
[04:54:52] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Try commenting out the l10n.js and comment-reply.js scripts in your Wordpress template.
[04:54:58] <peol> cerzi|work: yes, with every http request there's a bunch of overhead (http protocol + cookies etc.), and there's often a huge delay in xhr's when using mobile devices
[04:55:08] <Hemebond> brettgolding: That's just CSS. No problem there.
[04:55:16] <cerzi|work> peol: thanks, had a feeling that was the case
[04:55:43] <peol> cerzi|work: any way you could perhaps do these calls on the server side and just combine them into one?
[04:56:12] <cerzi|work> so instead i'll send everything in one xhr. it just seems kind of awkward, ive got the server telling the page how to load initially, and then need to query the server via xhr to update values based on what is in the db... think im making it more awkward than it needs t be
[04:56:25] <brettgolding> Hemebond: Removed comment-reply script still nothing...
[04:56:29] <gp5st1> so ${body} puts the escaped brs, but {{html body}} doesn't do anything (well, places nothing on the screen)
[04:56:42] <peol> cerzi|work: try dividing them into initial call + data transfer call
[04:57:08] <cerzi|work> im new to jquery so will have to look into that
[04:57:20] <cerzi|work> divide hem into 2 seperate calls after page load you mean?
[04:57:25] <cerzi|work> *them
[04:57:59] <peol> cerzi|work: yeah, so you get the init xhr stuff fast, and after that you load the data
[04:58:00] <cerzi|work> ideally id like to render the info from the db as the page loads in the first place, but because im using jinja2 it doesnt seem to be very easy to do
[04:58:05] <RipX> You know... it could well be jQuery that's caching it, I never knew a cache option existed. Does this just go in the anonymous function as a parameter such as: <script type="text/javascript"> 	$(document).ready(function(){ 		$.ajax( { 			cache: false,.....
[04:58:23] <cerzi|work> peol: i get you, sounds like a good idea. thanks
[04:58:24] <peol> RipX: yep
[04:58:48] <cherish> could someone tell me how to change img src into a different name?
[04:58:55] <RipX> hmmm... well, it's not that then
[04:58:58] <cherish> is it attr?
[05:02:23] <Hemebond> brettgolding: Still testing.
[05:02:31] <cherish> could someone help me with getting a zoom plugin working?
[05:02:58] <brettgolding> Thanks Hemebond
[05:03:12] <cherish> I am trying to jsfiddle it but but not sure what I need to change.
[05:04:30] <Hemebond> brettgolding: I might have found one issue. When I access that js via URL (http://webdev.stephband.info/js/jquery.jparallax.js) it doesn't even get downloaded. But if I download it it works fine.
[05:05:01] <brettgolding> I have downloaded the file and rehosted it on my own platform already cause I thought the same thing
[05:05:07] <brettgolding> here is my hosted version
[05:05:18] <brettgolding> http://www.brettgolding.com/js/jquery.jparallax.js
[05:07:08] <rvsjoen_> i've got a weird issue with the slider in jqueryui, when I move the slider back and forth its height changes dynamically and sometimes it just disappears, I was unable to reproduce this in jsfiddle, it is the yellow range slider at http://www.1800dealership.com/ and when you move the handlers back and forth you can observe the height of the .ui-slider-range div to change constantly
[05:07:28] <Hemebond> brettgolding: What is the script suppose to do with those images?
[05:09:55] <brettgolding> http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax_demos.html
[05:09:57] <dr0id> coldhead: ping!
[05:10:01] <brettgolding> Here is a working example
[05:18:49] <luaa> i am looking for a website of sean
[05:19:05] <luaa> it was a website with the context w3schools sucks
[05:19:10] <rvsjoen_> this actually happens after loading the exact same scripts as jsfiddle
[05:19:13] <Hemebond> brettgolding: I got it working.
[05:19:25] <RipX> Yeh... you're right, jQuery does seem to be caching this. I have 2 implementations running, one through jQuery and another directly from a webpage. The webpage version is updating correctly with a small delay from when I change my Skype status, yet the jQuery version takes ages.
[05:19:25] <rvsjoen_> the second I drag the first knob on the slider, a wrapping div is added to the DOM
[05:19:41] <luaa> I believe paul irish helped too
[05:19:51] <Hemebond> brettgolding: The plugin requires jQuery 1.2.6. You're importing 1.6.2. I didn't think it would matter because you said it worked for you, but I had to use 1.2.6 to get it working .
[05:19:53] <RipX> I've used the cache: false proprty, but it doesn't seem to ba making any difference
[05:20:33] <brettgolding> interesting... do you know if google hosts that version?
[05:21:31] <Hemebond> brettgolding: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js
[05:21:38] <Hemebond> http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[05:21:43] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, the way we use "parseInt(string)" is there any way to get carecter only?
[05:22:51] <brettgolding> and its working!!
[05:22:59] <brettgolding> a week i have tried to sort this
[05:23:03] <brettgolding> thanks Hemebond
[05:23:21] <smftre> how do I set the startup position of a JqueryUI Dialog??
[05:23:22] <Hemebond> brettgolding: You're welcome. How did it work on your simplified version?
[05:23:32] <brettgolding> no idea
[05:23:43] <brettgolding> i was using the most up to date jQuery...??
[05:24:57] <Hemebond> Very strange.
[05:25:17] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: You want all the letters from a string?
[05:25:20] <brettgolding> indeed
[05:25:24] <smftre> anybody?
[05:25:25] <Paveloosha> yes
[05:25:52] <Paveloosha> is there a way?
[05:26:16] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: regex
[05:26:34] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Regex is probably the easiest.
[05:27:43] <Paveloosha> Thanks <Hemebond>, I am testing..
[05:27:45] <RipX> Now I remember why I hate js
[05:27:46] <peol> Paveloosha: just a-z?
[05:28:08] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Look into String.replace()
[05:28:29] <Hemebond> peol: Yes.
[05:28:42] <peol> ?eval "this is a string with numbers, #34029, there's also words.".replace(/\s*\d+\s*/g, '')
[05:28:43] <bot-t> peol: "this is a string with numbers, #, there's also words."
[05:28:51] <peol> for everything except numbers
[05:28:59] <Paveloosha> <peol>, yes, but after your question I am thinking about special carecters too :)
[05:29:15] <TheDemz> --------
[05:29:15] <TheDemz> Question:
[05:29:15] <TheDemz> I got a button. That when initialized got a function. Then i want to override it with a new function.
[05:29:15] <TheDemz> When i type this:
[05:29:15] <TheDemz> $("#dialog_print-button").click(function () {
[05:29:16] <TheDemz>    alert("new function that wants to overide old one")
[05:29:16] <TheDemz> });
[05:29:17] <TheDemz> ..it just append the new function.
[05:29:17] <TheDemz> ---------
[05:29:26] <peol> TheDemz: Come on
[05:29:36] <Paveloosha> Hemebond, okay.
[05:29:37] <TheDemz> sorry
[05:30:14] <TheDemz> whats your standar way to ask long and complicated questions ?
[05:30:37] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: s.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '')
[05:30:59] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: That will remove any non-letter.
[05:31:01] <peol> TheDemz: I can see that question in one line with a link to jsfiddle.net (please see topics when you enter a help channel)
[05:31:12] <TheDemz> ok
[05:31:27] <Paveloosha> hmm, Hemebond, what about spaces?
[05:31:29] <TheDemz> ah
[05:31:48] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Anything you want to keep goes inside the []
[05:32:11] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Sorry, inside the [^      ]
[05:32:22] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Need that ^
[05:32:25] <peol> TheDemz: Try $("#dialog_print-button").unbind('click').click(….)
[05:32:40] <TheDemz> ok thx
[05:32:57] <keyle> Hi guys
[05:33:01] <Paveloosha> okay, if you have some time please explain it if you dont mind:)
[05:33:24] <keyle> I was wondering if one of you could test this for me on IE? https://github.com/keyle/knot.js/
[05:33:38] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: That regex (/[^a-zA-Z]/g) basically goes through each character in the string s.
[05:34:07] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: If the character is NOT inside the [^ ], it gets replaced with nothing (deleted effectively).
[05:34:38] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Also, this is a Javascript question, not jQuery.
[05:35:03] <Paveloosha> my question is "a-zA-Z" how it is checking "a" to "z", I mean how this understand the binoding between a-z?
[05:35:22] <peol> ?wiki regular expressions
[05:35:24] <bot-t> peol, Regular expression - In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as regex or regexp, provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression
[05:35:26] <soee> hi, im using slideUp when one of 6 elements is clicked and callback function for slideUp where slideDown is triggered, the problem is when i click  2 or more elements with onclick there is a problem with animation - one starts before second is finished, how can i fix this?
[05:35:28] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: a-z is a range. It will match any lowercase letter.
[05:35:28] <peol> Paveloosha: ^
[05:35:52] <Paveloosha> Thank you peol..
[05:35:53] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/redev2.shtml
[05:36:30] <yanger> is it possible to control one parent from another parent? i'm appending text to a parent in a iframe to the main parent...
[05:36:43] <Paveloosha> Thanks for jthe link Hemebond .
[05:37:08] <Paveloosha> Thank you Peol.. I going to drive into this.
[05:37:21] <Paveloosha> *I am
[05:37:45] <yanger> i'm starting to think no. hmm
[05:37:46] <peol> soee: Try using the :animated pseudo selector and check if the element is currently being animated, and cancel if so
[05:37:55] <peol> ? :animated @ soee
[05:37:56] <bot-t> soee, :animated: Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[05:38:14] <logik-bomb> whats the objective behind this? foobar = window.foobar || {};
[05:38:27] <logik-bomb> window.foobar
[05:38:28] <logik-bomb> thanks
[05:38:47] <rvsjoen_> ok so the problem seems to be related to mootools even though jQuery is running in noConflict mode, jQuery fires an event 'slide' and this even is in turn handled by mootools, which messes up my DOM
[05:39:16] <peol> logik-bomb: not a jQuery question, but it checks if window.foobar exist (and uses that), if not, it uses an empty object instead {}. it's often used to avoid undefined/null values in variables
[05:40:41] <Paveloosha> Hemebond, I understood about checking letters if that is inside the string but only one confusion that why it is not checking only for 'a', 'z' and 'A', 'Z'?
[05:40:45] <logik-bomb> peol: thanks.
[05:41:07] <Paveloosha> as I am providing [^a-zA-Z]
[05:41:15] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Because I told it to use a range. The - makes it check everything in between.
[05:41:26] <rvsjoen_> ok, so is there any way I can tell jquery to not trigger slide events on a certain element ?
[05:41:56] <keyle> nobody on IE? :/
[05:42:02] <Hemebond> keyle: Hahaha.
[05:42:39] <keyle> I just need someone with IE to test a plugin...
[05:42:57] <keyle> Sadly, I don't have parallels since... 2008
[05:44:14] <rvsjoen_> say what... jQuery.noConflict() does not affect the jqueryui librari ?
[05:44:56] <seutje> ugh, no easy way to decode html entities, is there?
[05:45:40] <p_masho> how do I get around the cross domain.. I've got a flightgear simulator which I patched to return json. I want to access this from a web page..http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1290533
[05:47:01] <seutje> this kosher? $.decodeEntity = function(str) { return $('<div>', {html: str}).text(); }
[05:47:41] <peol> seutje: yeah, it probably has some performance hits though
[05:47:48] <peol> seutje: why not -ot?
[05:51:30] <seutje> peol: better? window.decodeEntity = window.decodeEntity || function(str) { var frag = document.createElement('div'); frag.innerHTML = str; return frag.innerText; }
[05:51:40] <seutje> fuck this feels dumb
[05:52:02] <rvsjoen_> I tried the following combinations of jquery/jqueryui,   1.3.2/1.8.14, 1.4.2/1.8.14, 1.4.2/1.8.15, 1.6.2/1.8.14, 1.6.2/1.8.15 and jQuery.noConflict() has no effect on jQueryUI library even if jQuery is loaded first, so am I missing something here ?
[05:53:17] <_zoggy_> you dont access json across domains
[05:53:26] <_zoggy_> jsonp can though
[05:53:28] <erichynds> rvsjoen_: ui uses "jQuery", not $
[05:54:57] <rvsjoen_> not in my stack trace
[05:54:59] <rvsjoen_> http://imagebin.org/166519
[05:55:14] <rvsjoen_> all the calls in the jqueryui library are prefixed with $, not jQuery
[05:56:22] <dabear> rvsjoen_: they still can reference jQuery
[05:56:51] <peol> seutje: Yeah, or just have a genuine encode/decode function somewhere, but that looks better than the jquery approach imo
[05:56:52] <dabear> if I do function foo($){  $.widget = ....} and then do foo(jQuery)
[05:57:00] <rvsjoen_> yeah, but i'll conflict with other libraries, like mootools, no ?
[05:57:31] <dabear> rvsjoen_: NO
[05:58:03] <dabear> re-read my last sentence above yours
[05:58:29] <seutje> peol: this isn't a genuine function? o.O
[05:58:51] <p_masho> _zoggy_: thats what I'm trying to do.. but jsonp example not work//
[05:58:53] <rvsjoen_> what i'm trying to avoid is in the full stack trace ( I should have screenied the whole thing before ) http://imagebin.org/166520
[05:59:03] <peol> seutje: I meant converting them "manually" instead of using DOM elements :)
[05:59:05] <rvsjoen_> dabear: ok
[05:59:26] <seutje> peol: oh, like build a list of entities and their decoded representations?
[05:59:51] <Tmist> hey guys is it possible to fire an event when clicking a button inside an iframe which has content from an external source?
[05:59:54] <peol> seutje: i think that they map to some kind of unicode, so you could use \entitystuff
[06:00:04] <seutje> wouldn't that cause overhead when I'm only converting 1 entity once?
[06:00:04] <peol> seutje: iunno :p
[06:00:09] <seutje> peol: what about &gt; ?
[06:00:11] <seutje> and the likes
[06:00:18] <peol> ah, truth
[06:00:38] <seutje> peol: found this http://www.strictly-software.com/scripts/downloads/encoder.js and almost threw up
[06:01:29] <peol> seutje: yeah, your approach would probably be the best :)
[06:01:46] <seutje> also, this will make sure that if a browser doesn't recognize the non-numerical entity, it will give a numeric one when using encode
[06:01:59] <seutje> but not for decode :(
[06:02:06] <peol> webs are hard :(
[06:02:11] <seutje> INORITE?
[06:02:22] <seutje> wish I had my towel to comfort me
[06:03:39] <peol> aaaw ♥
[06:05:24] <sasori> <3
[06:05:33] <sasori> lol peol how'd you did that heart emoji ? :))
[06:05:55] <peol> sasori: just copy/paste a unicode character
[06:06:03] <sasori> aww, ok
[06:06:07] <sasori> ♥
[06:06:09] <peol> or have the text replacement stuff activated on mac
[06:06:11] <sasori> kews :))
[06:06:17] <sasori> kewl*
[06:07:16] <jeffsmykil> Do .change and .live not play well together?
[06:07:30] <seutje> sasori: windows has an easy to remember shortcut for it: alt+3
[06:07:31] <solocio> hey. i'm storing a class selector in a variable. then i load new elements with this class with ajax. but my selector variable can't find this new elements.
[06:07:45] <seutje> jeffsmykil: I don't understand the question
[06:07:51] <sasori> seutje: deamn awesome :))
[06:08:14] <jeffsmykil> do they work together as one might expect?
[06:08:26] <seutje> are vague questions worthless?
[06:08:42] <jeffsmykil> not when i get the answer im looking for
[06:08:46] <jeffsmykil> which i did
[06:08:50] <jeffsmykil> so mission accomplished
[06:08:58] <erichynds> wat
[06:09:02] <seutje> I'm not even gonna try to understand
[06:09:44] <Industria> H
[06:09:45] <Industria> Ji
[06:09:49] <Industria> Hi * (sorry)
[06:10:19] <Industria> There is a way to know if the cursor is moving ?
[06:10:20] <Tmist> Anyone know the anwser to my question? (is it possible to fire an event when clicking a button inside an iframe which has content from an external source?)
[06:10:30] <Industria> I want to determin if the mouse is moving or not
[06:10:38] <qwerty57> i've got a div with two anchors in it. what would be the best way to place those 2 anchors in separate variables?
[06:10:41] <peol> ?mousemove @ Industria
[06:10:41] <bot-t> Industria, .mousemove(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mousemove" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[06:11:28] <Industria> peol: I've already read it
[06:11:36] <peol> qwerty57: var anchors = $('div a'); use anchors[0], anchors[1] or simply assign those to their own variables
[06:11:40] <Industria> peol: It's ok to get the current position of my cursor
[06:12:01] <Industria> peol: I need to compare the last position with the actual position ?
[06:12:01] <qwerty57> ok great thanks!
[06:13:22] <peol> Industria: mousemove event fires VERY often, the last position will probably be a pixel or two in difference, if you really need to, just store the event data outside of that event handler and compare it inside of it
[06:14:36] <jeffsmykil> for a drop dowm menu to get the attribute of one of the options do I have to use this: selected or something?
[06:15:23] <peol> jeffsmykil: you mean the value from a <select>, or just some random <option> inside it?
[06:15:24] <qwerty57> peol it returns only the link anchor directs to. i'd like to have full tag starting with <a ...> and ending with </a>
[06:15:38] <jeffsmykil> random option inside of it that has been selected peol
[06:15:57] <jeffsmykil> i suppose i could use val
[06:16:38] <solocio> hey. i'm storing a class selector in a variable. then i load new elements with this class with ajax. but my selector variable can't find this new elements.
[06:16:41] <peol> qwerty57: you get a DOM reference, if you want the text, try anchors[0].outerHTML
[06:16:47] <jeffsmykil> yeah peol nevermind used val worked fine
[06:16:50] <jeffsmykil> thanks anyways
[06:16:59] <peol> jeffsmykil: np
[06:17:20] <qwerty57> greeeeeat! cheers
[06:18:42] <hooloovoo> Industria: That will work in Chrome but not in FF.
[06:19:03] <hooloovoo> Cause FF reads the mouse position so darn fast.
[06:19:52] <Industria> hooloovoo: So, there isn't a real solution ?
[06:19:53] <peol> solocio: Please post some code to jsfiddle.net, it sounds to me that you're trying to find them before they're added
[06:20:02] <hooloovoo> Industria: Sure there is.
[06:20:24] <hooloovoo> Industria: Store the last two mouse positions in a array. If the last position is the same as the new one check the one before that.
[06:20:39] <hooloovoo> It should give approximately the same mouse position offset cross browser.
[06:21:13] <solocio> @peol: no. but manually refreshing the variable after calling ajax functions did it.
[06:21:14] <AayPizzle> Morning guys, quick question, is there any robust, cross-browser way to copy text to clipboard using javascript/jquery that doesn't use Flash?
[06:21:51] <peol> solocio: Hehe, yeah, of course. jQuery queries the DOM when you do $('selector'), it's not live-updated...
[06:21:51] <RipX> I've managed to figure out the issue... when I run it locally the caching happens, but when I upload it to my remote server, the caching doesn't happen. Any ideas if this would always happen or if there is a setting in apache/php that would prevent this???
[06:22:01] <courpse> $('.'+modulename+'header').css('borderBottomLeftRadius') = '10px';
[06:22:05] <skroot> In IE8, why do I get an error message for $ being undefined?
[06:22:14] <courpse> Why does this say invalid left hand side assignment?
[06:22:33] <peol> courpse: you're using it wrong
[06:22:36] <AayPizzle> courpse: you need to give 10px as a second parameter of the css function
[06:22:40] <courpse> Obviously, lol.
[06:22:42] <peol> courpse: .css('borderBottomLeftRadius', '10px')
[06:22:44] <courpse> oh, my bad,.
[06:22:45] <courpse> Ta.
[06:23:02] <AayPizzle> I don't want to spam, but did anyone see my question? :D
[06:23:10] <peol> RipX: No idea, try #apache or #php
[06:23:17] <skroot> rah
[06:23:18] <skroot> so anywya
[06:23:23] <skroot> in iE8 i get $ is null or undefined
[06:23:31] <waerloga> AayPizzle: looks like the answer is not really...seems most of the suggestions I've found say use flash
[06:23:32] <skroot> in this:
[06:23:33] <skroot> 		$("#mainphoto").html("<img src='_images/gallery/photo_"+x+".png'>");
[06:23:42] <peol> skroot: Sounds like you're not loading jQuery correctly
[06:23:44] <skroot> but only in IE8
[06:23:50] <AayPizzle> waerloga: :-( all right thanks :D
[06:23:54] <skroot> it works fine in every other browser, peol
[06:24:01] <peol> skroot: They might have cached jQuery
[06:24:09] <skroot> who?
[06:24:18] <skroot> im testing it on my own machine in all different browsers
[06:24:28] <peol> skroot: The other browsers. How do you include your scripts?
[06:24:36] <skroot> <script src="http://cdn.webdrafter.com/jquery/jquery-1.6.2.min.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
[06:24:51] <peol> remove tye type-attribute
[06:24:54] <peol> the*
[06:25:02] <peol> skroot: or at least use text/javascript
[06:25:03] <skroot> that breaks it in IE8?
[06:25:06] <skroot> hrmmm
[06:25:07] <skroot> you know whaty
[06:25:08] <mephux> skroot: also thats vulnerable to xss - depending of the source of that variable. just a friendly reminder
[06:25:19] <skroot> mephux, the variable is in the same page
[06:25:28] <skroot> all it does is load a different image into a DIV
[06:25:33] <skroot> thats litteraly the only line of code in the function
[06:25:34] <skroot> but anyway
[06:25:44] <skroot> peol, i remember this once before but i thought i had to use application/javascript to fix it
[06:25:59] <mephux> skroot: where is x coming from..
[06:26:03] <pif> how can I test that the element I clicked is an instance of a <select> ?
[06:26:20] <peol> skroot: you can safely omit the type-attribute on <script>, all browsers default to text/javascript
[06:26:32] <mephux> skroot: try $("#mainphoto").html("<img src='_images/gallery/photo_"+x+".png' />");
[06:26:34] <skroot> mephux, it comes from the click event
[06:27:41] <skroot> peol, when i remove the thype attribute, it now says Object doesn't support this property or method
[06:27:46] <skroot> refering to the $ still, though
[06:28:01] <skroot> nevermind
[06:28:03] <skroot> i take that back
[06:28:10] <skroot> i forgot to remove the noconflict call from debugging
[06:28:35] <skroot> that seems to have fixed it. whew. thank you so much mephux and peol
[06:28:42] <peol> np
[06:28:52] <mephux> skroot: np
[06:36:43] <cherish> hi all .. just wondering if someone could look at a jsfiddle and advise on where i should insert some code to get a zoomer working.. the plugin needs anchor so I may need to add another var in but not sure where to append it either that or I need to wrap url around a img src.
[06:36:53] <cherish> my fiddle is at http://jsfiddle.net/cTn3f/2/

[06:40:41] <ropure> peol: oh, nice, this is working great!
[06:40:43] <ropure> thanks
[06:40:49] <peol> np :)
[06:41:09] <RipX> Although unlikely, I still can't rule out the issue being with jQuery until I can find out if it is infact a server problem since it might be a result of running jQuery locally!
[06:42:27] <seutje> holy ass, execCommand is a pain in the butt
[06:43:54] <ropure> peol: I was trying it : http://pastie.org/2325229 ; but mouseleave isn't good. Is there a mouseSleeping :p ?
[06:44:19] <oly> hi, can any one tell me if there is a jquery equivalent to toQueryParams which is from prototype library
[06:45:24] <peol> ropure: look at paul_irish's code at github. store the timeout timer id and clear it on mousemove.
[06:45:40] <ropure> peol: Ok
[06:45:45] <erichynds> oly: serialize() ?
[06:45:48] <ropure> peol: I go to read his code
[06:46:00] <dlmalloc> hi, I am using a jQuery UI accordian and I would like to open a specific element from my js code (not with #stuff on the URL). How can I do this?
[06:47:16] <oly> erichynds, i think serialize is the wrong way around as in i have a string which i want to turn into an object in essence
[06:47:24] <erichynds> ah
[06:47:26] <erichynds> jquery can't do that

[06:48:18] <oly> okay, thought that may be the case but thought i would check with some more knowledgeable people
[06:48:28] <oly> well think more get params in the url
[06:48:59] <erichynds> ok
[06:49:01] <erichynds> then yes
[06:49:07] <erichynds> ben alman has a plugin for that
[06:49:16] <erichynds> check out that link from bot-t

[06:51:49] <cherish> hi all .. just wondering if someone could look at a jsfiddle and advise on where i should insert some code to get a zoomer working.. the plugin needs anchor so I may need to add another var in but not sure where to append it either that or I need to wrap url around a img src.
[06:51:57] <ropure> peol: What is the interest of using a timer ?
[06:52:16] <cherish> my fiddle is at http://jsfiddle.net/cTn3f/2/
[06:53:19] <peol> ropure: you delay hiding the element that way, otherwise, you'll get a blinking element because users normally don't use their mouse in one big sweep
[06:58:42] <AdAlpha> hi guys, anyone had an idea about how to implement datas into a div which shows user detail, from a user list ?
[06:59:08] <Paveloosha> <Hemebond>, thanks, will it work if I use 0-9?
[06:59:14] <peol> AdAlpha: You mean attach data to a DOM element?
[06:59:18] <peol> Paveloosha: yes
[06:59:27] <Hemebond> Paveloosha: Yes. That will keep digits too.
[06:59:27] <Paveloosha> okay..
[06:59:39] <peol> Paveloosha: I think you'd like ^\w perhaps
[06:59:48] <Paveloosha> Thank you guys .. Now it is clear to me :)
[06:59:55] <peol> \w matches common letters and -_ etc.
[07:00:23] <AdAlpha> peol yes, if that suit best
[07:00:56] <AdAlpha> I can get each profile on separate page w/ href=/profil.php?user_name= etc ...
[07:01:14] <AdAlpha> but I'm stuck with getting it into the same page as the user list
[07:01:22] <cherish> can anyone give me 5 mins to help with a Jsfiddle which I am trying to figure out.  ?
[07:01:26] <peol> AdAlpha: You can leverage the new data-foo attribute in HTML5 (it's backwards compatible) and use $('#div').data('foo')
[07:02:02] <AdAlpha> @peol thks, will take a look at it
[07:02:19] <cherish> I have an example of what to do and also what I have I need to add it to. just need to know how to put it together.
[07:02:35] <Hemebond> AdAlpha: Are you talking about data attributes or just putting some text into a DIV?
[07:02:42] <AdAlpha> (btw that the site I'm talking about  http://the-chatbook.com/ )
[07:03:00] <AdAlpha> attributes, from different user
[07:03:02] <seutje> cherish: this zooming works for me
[07:03:11] <peol> AdAlpha: That way, you can also add JSON to your div's, like so: <div data-user='{"real_name": "Some Guy" }'>peol</div> and you'll get a object to work with when getting it with .data('user')
[07:03:56] <cherish> <seutje> hi yes the zooming does work .. as I have put an example in there.. but I need to add it to the image wrapper below it.. thats where I am struggling..
[07:04:20] <AdAlpha> hum.. okay
[07:04:41] <AdAlpha> will dive in that
[07:04:49] <cherish> <seutje> it uses anchors and so I need to either add an anchor to the src or find another way of adding it to the var images section..
[07:05:12] <keyword> hi guys question can I get the title of the external site with jquery?
[07:05:35] <peol> keyword: Not unless you're using some kind of web service
[07:05:57] <cherish> <seutje> the zoom works by using a href , I just need to know how to put that into the var section where its pulling my image data from  possibly
[07:06:47] <keyword> peol:  so I have to use another language like php for this?
[07:07:12] <cherish> <seutje> do you think its possible?
[07:07:14] <peol> keyword: Yes, or use YQL
[07:07:39] <keyword> peol:  how can I do it with yql ?
[07:08:13] <peol> ?g YQL jquery plugin @keyword
[07:08:14] <bot-t> keyword, jQuery YQL | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-yql
[07:08:28] <cherish> <seutje> you click the thumbs to change the image in the image wrapper so I need to zoom what is in the image wrapper at the time.
[07:09:27] <Jon47> keyword, you just want the contents of the html <title>
[07:09:44] <Jon47> $('title').html()
[07:09:47] <seutje> cherish: no clue what u mean tbh
[07:09:48] <keyword> Jon47:  yeap I kust want this
[07:09:56] <seutje> don't even see any anchors
[07:10:07] <Jon47> or $('title').text()
[07:10:09] <keyword> Jon47:  but how can get the site?
[07:10:16] <Jon47> the URL?
[07:10:37] <Jon47> what aer you asking
[07:11:00] <peol> Jon47: He's trying to get the title on a cross-domain website, nothing to do with DOM
[07:11:15] <peol> Or rather, nothing he can query for
[07:11:23] <peol> in the DOM of the current webpage
[07:11:33] <Jon47> oh yes I see
[07:11:43] <cherish> <seutje> : The bit running the working zoom is at the start of the body.
[07:12:03] <peol> keyword: Check out this guy's YQL, that's probably on of the more lightweight and better ones: https://github.com/jamespadolsey/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/cross-domain-ajax/jquery.xdomainajax.js
[07:12:19] <Jon47> just a crazy thought, you can use a jsonp header request to to a cross-domain URL and parse the response
[07:12:34] <cherish> <seutje> : the href and the images are in there which are under class zoom-cloud
[07:12:40] <Jon47> but if you're trying to something like that with jquery, you might want to investigate server side alternatives
[07:15:08] <AdAlpha> peol, is there anyway to get that user detail in the div by a simple $('#result').load('ajax/test.html'); ? or I'm just dreamin
[07:15:47] <peol> AdAlpha: If it's just some markup generated on the server-side, sure
[07:16:20] <freizeitradar> Does $("#el").trigger() only trigger within its child elements?
[07:16:40] <AdAlpha> the markup is generated once you click on user's name, is that still work ?
[07:18:42] <peol> AdAlpha: so you're making an xhr to the server and it generates the markup, if so, just do $('#el').html(responseData) in the success callbcak
[07:18:45] <peol> callback*
[07:19:16] <peol> freizeitradar: It should bubble like any other (normal) event, more or less
[07:19:38] <AdAlpha> ok, thk peol
[07:19:49] <xxghostxx> Hello, I'm having a problem with JQuery populating a drop box.  I have the code in the following pastebin link in the <head> of my site.  There is a state dropbox with states in it that when clicked should populate the city dropdown.  Now, the console_log(data) actually shows the <option value="blah">blah</select> etc.  However, the dropdown for #cities never gets populated...yet if I do inspect element in firebug i can see that all the cities are the
[07:19:56] <xxghostxx> http://pastebin.com/MkcseCPR
[07:21:21] <peol> xxghostxx: is <select> a normal <select>, or du you use some kind of third-party "drop down" plugin?
[07:21:42] <freizeitradar> peol: So, $("body").trigger("explode"); triggers "explode" on every single child and childchild element of <body>?
[07:21:43] <xxghostxx> it is <select id="cities> </select>
[07:22:26] <peol> freizeitradar: no, it bubbles from the element up to the root node (document), it doesn't go down from the root node to all childs
[07:23:26] <peol> xxghostxx: it almost sounds like the html that is returned is malformed, never heard a problem with using .html on a <select>
[07:23:53] <freizeitradar> peol: I see. But how could I achieve that?
[07:24:13] <xxghostxx> well the page it calls loops through each of the cities in the database and runs echo "<option value=\"$city\">$city</option>;
[07:24:37] <cherish> can anyone give me 5 mins to help with a Jsfiddle which I am trying to figure out.  ?
[07:25:03] <peol> freizeitradar: not sure what the best approach would be tbh, i would probably use some kind of pubsub for this
[07:25:07] <peol> instead of custom events
[07:25:35] <cherish> my fiddle is at http://jsfiddle.net/cTn3f/3/
[07:27:19] <xxghostxx> peol: any ideas on what I could try to rememdy?
[07:27:24] <cherish> I would be very grateful if someone could take a little look for me.
[07:27:40] <freizeitradar> peol: I see. Thank you.
[07:28:11] <AdAlpha> @cherish what you're trying to accomplish that don't work ?
[07:29:32] <xxghostxx> peol: it would also be good to note that i have $('#cities').css('border', 'red'); and it does not even put a red border around the dropdown
[07:30:11] <peol> xxghostxx: try logging $('#cities'), you sure it's there?
[07:30:39] <xxghostxx> like console.log($('#cities')); ?
[07:31:20] <xxghostxx> peol: console log findes it.  it returns [ select#cities ]
[07:32:15] <peol> xxghostxx: try running the generated html in w3 validator and see if it chokes on some attribute somewhere
[07:32:21] <cherish> <AdAlpha> I am trying to add a zoomer which I know works to my var images..  but I need it to work with the filestrings I have put in  I just need to know the best way to get it to work..  I have commented out the working one at the top of the body so that you can see how it works.. but I need it going into the images that I have in var images.
[07:34:21] <cherish> <AdAlpha> the script I am using uses an image wrapper and I need to be able to point the zoom at whichever image is in the image wrapper at the time.
[07:35:04] <cherish> <AdAlpha>so really I need to add something in along with the src, srcBig, LongDescription, Title, etc
[07:35:30] <Birliban> Hi, is there a way to 'query' a json object? i want to give e.g. an id and now want the field from the json where the id matches?
[07:35:34] <xxghostxx> peol: that got it :) my php code was dropping an end tag
[07:36:16] <cherish> <AdAlpha>something like wrap the image src with the href and point the href at a larger image for zoom
[07:36:46] <xxghostxx> @peol:  thank you for your help!  I really appreciate it!
[07:37:04] <AdAlpha> I'll take a look at it cherish (I bet you've already check out existing scripts)
[07:37:20] <peol> xxghostxx: np's
[07:38:25] <cherish> <AdAlpha> yes.. and thank you.. I think all thats needed is already in the fiddle its just wrapping the stuff correctly..  if you want to know the script src.. its http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm
[07:39:28] <cherish> <AdAlpha> Thank you very much for responding though..  I have been trying to fix this for ages and just need someones assistance as am not experienced enough with jquery yet..
[07:39:42] <AdAlpha> you just distracted me with that links and the girl :D
[07:39:48] <cherish> <AdAlpha> haha
[07:40:34] <cherish> <AdAlpha> yes shes pretty beautiful....
[07:41:01] <jeffsmykil> is the js date object a reference type or a value type?
[07:45:02] <AdTaylor> hey, could anyone recommend a good way of watching a collection (not elements) and binding a change event to it? Is there a way to get there using jQuery?
[07:45:44] <jeffsmykil> AdTaylor: are you trying to manipulate the non-elements after they are brought into the dom?
[07:47:19] <zi> I set $('input').change(function () { console.log(this.val());, but nothing gets logged, ever. What the hell? (I do have inputs that I change)
[07:47:52] <jeffsmykil> you need this
[07:47:58] <jeffsmykil> ($(this.val()
[07:48:05] <jeffsmykil> this isnt a native object or whatever
[07:48:08] <jeffsmykil> zi
[07:48:19] <zi> That doesn't matter. It still doesn't fire. Not even an error.
[07:48:22] <AdTaylor> No, much more simplistic — I have a collection of objects (holding data) and I was hoping that if they got modified it could fire an event. Basically, I'm wanting to emulate backbone behavious in a jquery plugin (I'm guessing this is a bad idea but wanted to have a look anyway)
[07:48:54] <jeffsmykil> what are the collections held in and how are they edidted AdTaylor
[07:48:55] <AdTaylor> wow, sorry about typos — clear too wired to type!
[07:49:01] * zi makes a test case.
[07:49:09] <jeffsmykil> zi did you try not using this?
[07:49:12] <peol> zi: inputs doesn't fire 'change' until you blur/leave it, also, if you're pulling in the HTML from ajax, you need to use .delegate/.live, bound events with .<event> or .bind doesn't live-update
[07:49:15] <jeffsmykil> and using the objects ID?
[07:49:18] <pif> how do I find out how many elements does a <select> list have?
[07:49:20] <zi> Oh, nvm. I'm a retard.
[07:49:32] <jeffsmykil> select.length should work
[07:49:37] <pif> ok!
[07:49:40] <zi> Forgot to add document ready. hadn't developed anything in a while
[07:50:09] <AdTaylor> for example, if the options of a plugin were modified (though potentially a bad use case)
[07:50:14] <pif> jeffsmykil: and when using a jquery selector?
[07:50:28] <jeffsmykil> so like $(this).length pif
[07:50:30] <jeffsmykil> should do it for you
[07:51:11] <jeffsmykil> var selectLength = $("#MY SELECTOBJECT").length;
[07:52:31] <jeffsmykil> AdTaylor im not sure i get what you are asking
[07:54:31] <phentges> Morning!
[07:55:16] <qwerty57> i'm not that good with javascript. what's with multi level arrays?
[07:55:18] <AdTaylor> jeffsmykil : In backbone (thus I guess Underscore), if I have an collection [ coll = { data : {bar : 'foo'}, moredata : { foo : 'bar'} } ] and I want to bind it to an event to it I would call this.coll.bind('change', this.fuction, this); or something
[07:55:26] <qwerty57> closedState[triggerID][i] = divs[i].outerHTML;
[07:55:38] <qwerty57> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '0' of undefined
[07:55:40] <qwerty57> why?
[07:56:11] <jeffsmykil> AdTaylor: you are going to have to ask someone much smarter than I, I don't know any of this backbone stuff
[07:56:13] <jeffsmykil> sorry
[07:56:26] <thinkt4nk> it's not an object
[07:56:27] <phentges> I'm working with a jQuery UI droppable. My drop option calls a function that gets the ui object. How can I tell if that object is the original draggable or the helper?
[07:56:29] <thinkt4nk> it's undefined
[07:56:56] <jeffsmykil> phentges im pretty sure thats in the documentation
[07:57:06] <jeffsmykil> been a while since i played with drag drop though
[07:57:14] <jeffsmykil> they are both defined somehow
[07:57:14] <phentges> jeffsmykil Didn't see it in the docs. :(
[07:57:17] <jeffsmykil> i just cand remember how
[07:57:28] <AdTaylor> jeffsmykil: thanks for looking anyway, really appreciate it!
[07:57:56] <jeffsmykil> AdTaylor: siorry i wasnt more help
[07:58:10] <jeffsmykil> or any for that matter :-p
[07:58:14] <greenmanspirit> I am trying to do a AJAX post for a form and they page is redirecting, the code is here http://pastebin.com/wcN2ieCB, I never get to alert("foo5"); after I hit the ok for alert("foo4") the browser opens actions/termupd2, I get no error output with firebug since the redirect happens and clears the console, any ideas?
[07:58:16] <phentges> Hmm. And now I look and see ui.draggable and ui.helper are properties.
[07:58:32] <jeffsmykil> phentges: you good now?
[07:58:34] <phentges> That may get me in the right direction.
[07:58:48] <jeffsmykil> phentges: i remembered it was somewhere
[07:58:54] <phentges> I'll shout back if I hit another block. Thanks.

[08:26:50] <sphinxxx> lol
[08:27:18] <keyword> how can I truncate a string with jquery?
[08:28:07] <RTPMatt> instanceoftom: this will be the thing that was clicked
[08:29:06] <instanceoftom> RTPMatt: thanks, i just tried $(this) and it worked perfectly
[08:29:23] <RTPMatt> yeah, that is it
[08:30:51] <xp_prg> if I want to add alert('I added something to to an existing function'); $(function)() { alert('I was already defined, please add something else to this function'); }
[08:31:47] <dlmalloc> Why does the selector 'h3#test' not work for <h3 id="test">? :(
[08:32:08] <sphinxxx> why not just select by id directly?
[08:32:16] <dlmalloc> sphinxxx: slow.
[08:32:26] <dlmalloc> I'd prefer to have the tag infront.
[08:32:55] <sphinxxx> no its actually slower to do it like that
[08:33:00] <RTPMatt>  dlmalloc: adding a tag to a direct ID selection is slower than not adding it
[08:33:05] <dlmalloc> Really?! ;o
[08:33:13] <dlmalloc> I was under the impression it was the other way around.
[08:33:20] <sphinxxx> when there is just id, it goes directly to the javascript getelementbyid
[08:33:24] <dlmalloc> Well that certianly makes things easier. :)
[08:34:22] <dlmalloc> Cheers.
[08:34:38] <xp_prg> so nobody knows the answer to my question?
[08:34:38] <jjb123> Hey, does anyone have any idea how I would count the number of <tr>'s in a table that aren't hidden (i.e. "display: none;")?
[08:35:17] <nail_> jjb123: there's the :visible selector
[08:35:39] <Tobsn> xp_prg, that really doesnt count as question
[08:35:49] <nail_> (or :hidden)
[08:35:51] <xp_prg> why?
[08:35:59] <jjb123> nail_: Ah, cool thanks
[08:36:05] <Tobsn> try again ;)
[08:38:25] <snollux> OK I'm having some _WEIRD_ trouble with jquery and wordpress.. basically the $post['post_content'] is THERE and works fine in PHP (I can echo it, etc no problem) and so is $post['post_title']. The weird part is this: $post['post_title'] works fine when I use it in Jquery, but $post['post_content'] is treated like null. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/tnYuU9V2
[08:40:49] <adbe> snollux: maybe it's got quote marks in it?
[08:41:37] <gurumelo> print_r($post);
[08:42:03] <keyword> how can I truncate a string witj jquery
[08:42:53] <TheIronSky> trunc8
[08:43:01] <jeffsmykil> slice?
[08:43:02] <nail_> .substring (that's native js, not jquery)
[08:44:14] <jeffsmykil> fuck i forgot about substring and have been using slice for this entire project
[08:44:22] <jeffsmykil> and saving the new string as a variable
[08:44:25] * jeffsmykil face palm
[08:46:12] <snollux> adbe: addslashes(strip_tags ($pc))  still doesn't work for me
[08:46:34] <adbe> what is the output?
[08:46:49] <snollux> none whatsoever
[08:46:54] <snollux> like there's an errror
[08:47:24] <adbe> in the source
[08:48:40] <snollux> adbe: you want me to give $post['post_content'] as given by PHP ?
[08:49:05] <adbe> no, the html source of the page
[08:49:13] <adbe> what exactly is showing up in the script
[08:49:23] <adbe> right click->view source etc
[08:50:16] <droptimize> Hello All :)
[08:50:18] <nail_> also, maybe take a look at what you actually submit...
[08:50:34] <nail_> (on the client side)
[08:54:29] <greenmanspirit> I am trying to do a AJAX post for a form and they page is redirecting, the code is here http://pastebin.com/wcN2ieCB, I never get to alert("foo5"); after I hit the ok for alert("foo4") the browser opens actions/termupd2, I get no error output with firebug since the redirect happens and clears the console, any ideas?
[08:55:28] <freizeitradar> How can I trigger an event and make all child elements listen to it?
[08:56:09] <skroot> Is it better to rely on the code.jquery.com CDN or put the libraries on my own CDN?
[08:56:50] <droptimize> freizetradar... .children() http://api.jquery.com/children/
[08:57:29] <droptimize> if it's 1 line, can we code in here?
[08:57:47] <RTPMatt> skroot: there is not single answer for that question.
[08:58:09] <droptimize> $("#myDiv").children(".listeners").click(function(){});
[08:58:37] <skroot> RTPMatt, true
[08:58:48] <skroot> just didnt know if there was an obvious negative to using their cdn
[09:00:17] <freizeitradar> droptimize: The thing is, I don't know any selector of my children. What I'm looking for is something like: $("body").trigger("admin"); and every single element binded to "admin" is gonna execute its callback.
[09:00:23] <RTPMatt> It could cause problems if it is unreachable, you could get around that with a script loader
[09:04:35] <jberglund> I've made a floating menu script, it work's and all that, but how do I get it to only start following when reaching a certain point?
[09:05:52] <Tixz> Hi, anybody know why Form.Validator.Inline stops validation after the first fail is encountered?
[09:06:11] <Tixz> Sorry wrong channel
[09:06:15] <Xeon06_> Is there an equivalent to prototype's Function.bind in jQuery?
[09:12:46] <pootpoot> if i were to do a .detach().appendTo() function on an IFRAME
[09:12:51] <phlp> Xeon06_: dont know what prototype does different but there is a native Function.bind https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[09:12:55] <pootpoot> will that cause the iframe to reload?
[09:13:01] <pootpoot> in every browser?
[09:14:00] <Xeon06_> phlp: That's pretty much it, except the native one isn't implemented in all browsers. But there's a solution for that on the MDC page you linked. Thanks
[09:14:39] <Danny_Joris> seen malsup?
[09:14:42] <phlp> Xeon06_: there is also $.proxy
[09:14:49] <Lampoon> malsup was last seen in #jquery-dev 12 weeks 2 days ago saying 'Big thumbs up to the attr/prop change description on the blog.  Well done.'.
[09:15:10] <Danny_Joris> aww.
[09:15:41] <Danny_Joris> I have this issue with jquery cycle: https://github.com/malsup/cycle/issues/53
[09:15:45] <Xeon06_> phlp: Ahh, that's what I was looking for. Thanks!
[09:15:52] <Danny_Joris> it's a detail, but it's bugging me...
[09:15:52] <phlp> :)
[09:15:58] <gleitz> Anyone familiar with multiple select menus in jQuery Mobile?
[09:16:18] <gleitz> They seem to be super buggy when I update them via Javascript
[09:41:17] <stianhj> I have a collection of elements from a selector.. is there a jquery method to check if a certain element is a part of that collection?
[09:43:39] <SamuelDivFinder> Hey all. I'm trying to find out if jquery has the ability to find things by comparison. Specifically, I've got over 200 div layers with unknown top and left css settings. I need to filter out ones that are outside of a specific range so the script I am working on is not extremely slow.
[09:47:05] <Brodingo> ?index @ stianhj
[09:47:06] <bot-t> stianhj, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[09:47:23] <stianhj> Brodingo: thanks
[09:49:03] <Phrogz> ?filter @ SamuelDivFinder
[09:49:04] <bot-t> SamuelDivFinder, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[09:50:22] <SamuelDivFinder> Phrogz, thanks!
[09:52:51] <instanceoftom> how do i get the css classes of something i have selected via $("#foo")?
[09:53:48] <macdada> hi, do you know why would function show(), hide(), fadeIn() work and only fadeOut() wouldn't?
[09:56:42] <Phrogz> instanceoftom: You could $('#foo')[0].className.split(' ');
[10:05:33] <versatiletech> instanceoftom: or $('#foo').attr('class')
[10:10:28] <ravenzz> i am performing a ajaxRequest to automatically fill some input fields, so when the request is executed i disable those inputs and i would place a loading icon. But happen that the disabled gray background disappear
[10:10:31] <ravenzz> is that a bug?
[10:13:18] <versatiletech> ravenzz: huh?

[10:16:27] <sadmicrowave> oh
[10:16:31] <ravenzz> i wouldn't spread the live website, because i am still in dev
[10:17:23] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, so whats the problem with the disable property?
[10:17:51] <ravenzz> even though the input is disabled, when i set the bg image it become white
[10:18:02] <sadmicrowave> for email?
[10:18:07] <ravenzz> yes
[10:18:18] <sadmicrowave> but the text is grey
[10:18:35] <sadmicrowave> thats how textbox input fields are supposed to look when they are disabled
[10:18:38] <ravenzz> ... i am talking about the bg
[10:18:53] <ravenzz> yep, light gray background
[10:19:06] <ravenzz> is even better than white
[10:19:11] <sadmicrowave> no, I mean, white background and grey text...thats the only way I've ever seen it
[10:19:18] <ravenzz> wtf
[10:19:19] <cheeby> hi.  playing with the jquery datepicker.  is it possible to get datetime with hours and minutes?
[10:19:43] <ravenzz> every disabled input i ever seen, is gray
[10:20:15] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, buttons, checkboxes, and radios are gray but not textboxes
[10:20:25] <ravenzz> i'll show you
[10:20:31] <ccmonster> cheeby,  http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate
[10:20:31] <sadmicrowave> at least to my knowledge, I've never seen it
[10:20:44] <ccmonster> you can pass one of those formats into the datepicker when you initialize
[10:21:01] <cheeby> ccmonster: cool.  thanks.
[10:21:10] <phlp> for me ff and ie have white backgrounds, chrome has gray
[10:21:31] <ravenzz> sadmicrowave ok try again, now i don't set any background
[10:21:47] <ravenzz> ok its possible
[10:21:53] <ravenzz> phlp ^
[10:22:19] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, yea I see that now in jsfiddle also, sorry for my initial comments
[10:23:11] <ravenzz> ok i will fix it in a dirty way, i will set the color too
[10:24:01] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, try $('#user_mail').attr('disabled','disabled');
[10:24:33] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/8efJJ/
[10:25:30] <ravenzz> sadmicrowave the "bug" is when i set a bg-image http://jsfiddle.net/8efJJ/1/
[10:26:21] <ravenzz> anyway, fixed by setting the bgcolor
[10:26:29] <sadmicrowave> oh ok
[10:26:37] <sadmicrowave> sorry for the confusion
[10:27:46] <ravenzz> np, my english sucks so maybe i didn't give you a good explaination
[10:27:59] <aaronmcadam> anyone going to full frontal?
[10:28:09] <sadmicrowave> nudity?
[10:28:36] <aaronmcadam> hah
[10:28:42] <sadmicrowave> no
[10:28:42] <aaronmcadam> http://2011.full-frontal.org/
[10:28:51] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/kZJmjKw8  -- is this valid/going to work?
[10:28:52] <aaronmcadam> js conf in UK
[10:29:02] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, not me
[10:29:24] <sadmicrowave> swiggy, can you tell us if you are getting an error?
[10:29:29] <aaronmcadam> hey adam, read your debug site earlier, really good resource for people on here
[10:29:59] <aaronmcadam> aww man
[10:31:47] <swiggy> i havent tried it sadmicrowave
[10:31:52] <swiggy> im just wondering if it works
[10:32:19] <swiggy> if the <Select> is visible and the value is null/empty (ie <option value="">-- select a publication --</option> is selected)
[10:32:36] <ccmonster> has anyone used ben almans bbq?
[10:33:11] <sadmicrowave> swiggy, oh wait, I don't think you can chain on .is() since it returns a true or false
[10:33:20] <sadmicrowave> look: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/qVBg9/
[10:34:16] <sadmicrowave> swiggy, an alternative way would be: $('input:visible').val();
[10:34:31] <sadmicrowave> or in your case if( $('input:visible').val() == '' )
[10:34:43] <swiggy> so -- $('select[id^="pub_related"]:visible').val()
[10:35:15] <sadmicrowave> yes, or if( $('input').val() == '' && $('input').is(':visible') )
[10:36:45] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster, check out jqueryfordesigners, there's a good vid tut on there about it
[10:37:00] <ccmonster> nice. Have you used it?
[10:37:08] <aaronmcadam> looks like ben's stepped away
[10:37:11] <aaronmcadam> his name's grey
[10:37:14] <aaronmcadam> I used it ages ago
[10:37:28] <aaronmcadam> can't really remember the specifics of it I'm afraid
[10:37:31] <aaronmcadam> it's not too bad I think
[10:40:18] <ccmonster> I wonder if it's the preferred back button plugin to use. or maybe there is a better alternative now.
[10:40:33] <aaronmcadam> well
[10:40:38] <aaronmcadam> for hashChange stuff
[10:40:41] <aaronmcadam> i think it still is
[10:40:48] <ccmonster> i know html5 has history api
[10:41:03] <krz> is there anything wrong with this: $('.mark_it_up textarea').keyup().trigger();
[10:41:04] <aaronmcadam> well yeah but you can't really depend on that stuff yet
[10:41:12] <aaronmcadam> I take it you need cross browser support
[10:41:19] <aaronmcadam> yea krz
[10:41:22] <ccmonster> Um, firefox or chrome basically.
[10:41:23] <aaronmcadam> you wanna trigger the keyup
[10:41:31] <aaronmcadam> trigger('keyup')
[10:41:38] <krz> ahh yes
[10:41:39] <krz> thanks
[10:41:48] <ccmonster> or use the debounce stuff from benalman :)
[10:42:09] <aaronmcadam> yes!
[10:42:16] <aaronmcadam> debounce is awesome
[10:42:23] <aaronmcadam> never had to use it really
[10:42:27] <aaronmcadam> but it's so well done
[10:42:28] <ajpiano> ccmonster bbq is good for hash history but it doesn't support pushstate
[10:42:39] <ajpiano> you can take a look at History.js if you want something that supports the html5 stuff
[10:42:45] <ajpiano> ?g balupton history js
[10:42:46] <bot-t> ajpiano, Intelligent State Handling - GitHub - https://github.com/balupton/History.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling
[10:42:48] <aaronmcadam> ah that's the one
[10:43:30] <ShawnRisk> I have a jquery script that I want to run only on a page with a certain URL - Does anyone know if/how this can be done. Thanks!
[10:44:23] <ccmonster> basically, im passed a ?cat=CategoryName parameter, and depending on that cat, i ajax load a certain page. if the user (via a ui-menu) selects a different category, I want to change the url (the cat=NewCatName) and then load the new respective via ajax. I need back support. So I'm not sure what the best route is
[10:44:33] <aaronmcadam> can't you include it on the given webpage shawn
[10:44:45] <ccmonster> what aaronmcadam said.
[10:45:10] <aaronmcadam> you could hack something but it's not a great way to do things
[10:46:13] <ccmonster> you talking to me aaronmcadam ?
[10:46:44] <aaronmcadam> no, shawn dude
[10:46:57] <ccmonster> Ok. Any ideas on my situation I stated above?
[10:47:10] <ShawnRisk> aaronmcadam: explain again?
[10:47:16] <aaronmcadam> um
[10:47:25] <aaronmcadam> include the script on the actual page?
[10:47:26] <Brodingo> ?bbq
[10:47:27] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[10:47:38] <aaronmcadam> yea ccmonster
[10:47:41] <ccmonster> in the page that you want the script to run on , include the script in the header of the page.
[10:47:46] <aaronmcadam> did you watch remy sharp's video on it
[10:47:51] <ccmonster> I am watching it.
[10:47:54] <aaronmcadam> cool man
[10:48:05] <ccmonster> But that is using hash. Mine is via a parameter.
[10:48:12] <ccmonster> not a hash param
[10:48:13] <Brodingo> you can get the window.location.path if you want
[10:48:16] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[10:48:18] <ShawnRisk> aaronmcadam: nope
[10:48:27] <aaronmcadam> well yeah that's the whole point
[10:48:33] <aaronmcadam> you need to put /#/?
[10:48:44] <aaronmcadam> look at jquery mobile's docs
[10:48:49] <aaronmcadam> and click around and watch the url
[10:49:08] <aaronmcadam> it hangs on the hash
[10:49:10] <ShawnRisk> moblie?
[10:49:19] <ShawnRisk> I am not talking about that at all
[10:49:27] <aaronmcadam> wha? not talking to you shawn
[10:49:59] <aaronmcadam> why can't you include the script on the actual page then Shawn
[10:50:21] <ShawnRisk> I am using a CMS that is why :P
[10:50:25] <aaronmcadam> you should try to do as much as you can /without/ js
[10:50:27] <ccmonster> so you are saying I should start my url (after domain of course) with a /#/?cat=CatName
[10:50:27] <ccmonster> ?
[10:50:35] <aaronmcadam> something like that yes
[10:50:45] <ccmonster> That is VERY strange.
[10:50:46] <phlp> ShawnRisk: http://yepnopejs.com
[10:50:49] <ccmonster> Is that a standard?
[10:50:51] <aaronmcadam> it's how it works dude
[10:50:55] <aaronmcadam> it needs a hash
[10:51:04] <aaronmcadam> hence the event hashChange
[10:51:14] <aaronmcadam> that ben implemented himself as a custom event
[10:51:24] <aaronmcadam> for browsers that don't have it
[10:51:28] <ccmonster> Hmm, I didn't see that piece
[10:51:30] <ShawnRisk> I don't get it
[10:51:40] <Brodingo> if(window.location.pathname == "/whatever") ShawnRisk {//some coads}
[10:51:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[10:51:56] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: let me try
[10:51:58] <aaronmcadam> I was trying to steer him away from that but alrighty
[10:52:18] <Brodingo> shrugs
[10:52:23] <aaronmcadam> yep heh :)
[10:52:39] <aaronmcadam> yepnope's cool
[10:52:50] <Brodingo> if($('#idOnlyOnThisPage').length){}
[10:52:55] <aaronmcadam> couldn't get a viable solution working with jqm tho
[10:53:05] <aaronmcadam> that's probably best Brodingo yea
[10:53:15] <aaronmcadam> for an id or class on the body
[10:53:26] <Brodingo> what CMS ShawnRisk
[10:54:14] <aaronmcadam> CMSs shouldnt restrict you in that way
[10:54:25] <ccmonster> would you suggest I just take the ?cat=CatName and then just it the #CatName
[10:54:27] <ccmonster> at the end
[10:54:27] <ShawnRisk> Drupal
[10:54:31] <aaronmcadam> should be using an include in the head to set which scripts are loaded
[10:55:14] <aaronmcadam> hmm depends on how you wanna feed in the hash to your ajax
[10:55:34] <aaronmcadam> you could just do data : { cat : window.location.hash }
[10:55:53] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/p8Und/1/  -- halp :P
[10:56:13] <Brodingo> ShawnRisk is this just a node page? panel? view?
[10:56:15] <ccmonster> use data? how backwards compatible is that?
[10:56:17] <aaronmcadam> ShawnRisk: aren't you using some sort of script loading mechanism?
[10:56:46] <aaronmcadam> not necessarily lab/require/yepnope, some php include?
[10:57:16] <aaronmcadam> are you loading the every script on every page?
[10:57:46] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: this is an exposed filter page display view
[10:58:05] <surfdue> anyone use jqplot in here?
[10:58:14] <surfdue> it is rendering improperly in safari and IE8
[10:58:51] <Brodingo> maybe you could edit the view template to add_js to the page
[10:59:22] <Brodingo> do you used drupal.behaviors or doc.ready
[11:00:07] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/p8Und/1/  -- how do i associate $(this) within an IF statement of a parent selector?
[11:00:22] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: not in this code
[11:00:40] <ShawnRisk> the two urls are: students/Awards/search and students/Awards/search?field_bursary_inter_student_value=Yes
[11:00:57] <swiggy> $('#parentselector').bind('submit',function() {      if ( $('#selector').is(':visible') ){ //make a $(this) work with $('#selector') } });
[11:02:29] <macdada> (up!) do you know why would function show(), hide(), fadeIn() work and only fadeOut() wouldn't?
[11:02:42] <ccmonster> dont do $(this) anyway. make a seperate reference
[11:02:46] <phlp> swiggy: var s = $('#selector'); if(s.is(':visible')) { /* USE s HERE */    }
[11:02:50] <ccmonster> $this = $(this)
[11:03:24] <surfdue> no one uses jqplo ?
[11:03:31] <swiggy> phlp, can you look @ my jsfiddle
[11:03:42] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: other ideas?
[11:03:48] <swiggy> i am using $('select[id^="whatever_"]')
[11:04:04] <swiggy> so my 'selector' has multiple choices
[11:04:15] <swiggy> and i want $(this) to relate to the one that matches my if
[11:04:22] <ccmonster> do a ternary operater as well. var s = $('#selecter'); var parent = (s.is(':visible')) ? this is my paret : that is my parent;
[11:04:47] <phlp> swiggy: first off your .val is only checking the first element from the selection
[11:04:49] <instanceoftom> i have a click event for when the user clicks on the body element, and when  the user clicks on a list item, how do i prevent the body click event from firing when i  click on the li?
[11:05:04] <instanceoftom> inspect the event that is passed?
[11:05:14] <Brodingo> ShawnRisk seems like the easiest way would be checking window.location.path and/or window.location.query
[11:05:36] <phlp> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/p8Und/2
[11:06:11] <swiggy> ah ty
[11:06:37] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: okay and what would this line be?
[11:08:14] <yeshwanthvenkate> Hey guys I am not able to pass the value to a global variable could any one help
[11:08:17] <aaronmcadam> indexOf

[11:08:34] <yeshwanthvenkate> my code is here
[11:08:35] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn indexOf @ ShawnRisk
[11:08:36] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, jQuery.inArray() - Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[11:08:41] <aaronmcadam> fuck's sake lol

[11:08:44] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Mozilla Developer Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/
[11:08:48] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc indexOf

[11:08:56] <Brodingo> well
[11:08:59] <aaronmcadam> so you say
[11:09:06] <aaronmcadam> if indexOf !== -1
[11:09:12] <aaronmcadam> that's how you know it's present
[11:09:29] <aaronmcadam> or why don't you add a class to the body element that's unique to that page
[11:10:03] <aaronmcadam> or is the cms getting in your way
[11:10:50] <Brodingo> if ((window.location.pathname === "tudents/Awards/search") && window.location.search === "" || window.location.search === "?field_bursary_inter_student_value=Yes")
[11:11:26] <aaronmcadam> yucky
[11:11:31] <phlp> && house_of_cards == true
[11:12:07] <aaronmcadam> && inception == ( true && !!true  || ( false && !!1 ) )
[11:12:25] <Brodingo> well
[11:12:43] <aaronmcadam> I'm not having a go at you Brodingo
[11:12:55] <aaronmcadam> just there's gotta be a better way than that
[11:13:17] <aaronmcadam> I try to stay away from brittle code like that
[11:13:22] <Brodingo> probably doable in the template layer but it might be ugly too
[11:13:32] <Brodingo> shrugs
[11:13:35] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:13:42] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having trouble with the ajax approach to the pagination plugin
[11:13:50] <phlp> Brodingo: does this help? http://drupal.org/node/304178
[11:13:57] <aaronmcadam> he should be using a php template or something to call his script tags
[11:14:04] <aaronmcadam> I used to when using EE
[11:14:10] <aaronmcadam> was really handy
[11:14:15] <Brodingo> im aware
[11:14:45] <aaronmcadam> people shouldn't let a CMS rule them anyway
[11:14:54] <aaronmcadam> or is drupal that bad hehe
[11:15:42] <ShawnRisk> I tried this: if ((window.location.pathname === "tudents/Awards/search") && window.location.search === "") and that still shows this open on the first students/Awards/search
[11:15:52] <Brodingo> theres drupal_add_js() method
[11:16:09] <phlp> the whitehouse uses drupal and only corporations own them.. so i guess drupal doesnt
[11:16:17] <Brodingo> like here theres testing the arguments http://drupal.org/node/304178#comment-996439
[11:16:20] <ShawnRisk> o
[11:16:28] <Brodingo> im sure it could be adapted to also look at the query
[11:17:35] <ShawnRisk> well the problem is that students/Awards/search is there all the time
[11:18:28] <Brodingo> right so you have to make sure the query is either exactly what you want or not there at all
[11:18:54] <aaronmcadam> why can't you add something unique and test that?
[11:19:01] <aaronmcadam> was that answered yet Brodingo
[11:19:58] <Brodingo> certainly doable in certain circumstances, but im worried about relying on a specific query sting for that too
[11:20:41] <ShawnRisk> how do I do that?  Confusing this seems
[11:21:14] <phlp> i think i sent my suggestion to Brodingo thinking you had ShawkRisk's problem
[11:26:25] <ShawnRisk> oh
[11:26:46] <pwf> has anyone had problems with whitespace appearing around a div while animating?
[11:27:13] <pwf> i have a div at the top of my screen that i want to drop down, but while it's animating it's not flush with the top of the screen
[11:27:21] <pwf> only after the animation is done will it line up
[11:27:27] <ShawnRisk> Brodingo: any last thoughts before I have to leave?
[11:27:27] <aaronmcadam> you've got ghosts in your divs again :(
[11:27:39] <pwf> i had an exorcist here last week ):
[11:27:44] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[11:27:47] <Brodingo> give 110%, max the envelope, etc
[11:28:08] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ pwf
[11:28:08] <bot-t> pwf, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:28:16] <ShawnRisk> what?
[11:28:46] <pwf> eh i'd rather not paste the whole thing, it's a new site and rather involved
[11:28:50] <pwf> let me see if i can reproduce it
[11:28:53] <pwf> with less code
[11:28:55] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[11:29:03] <aaronmcadam> never paste your whole app
[11:29:15] <aaronmcadam> less code the better
[11:29:31] <ShawnRisk> thanks for your help
[11:29:42] <aaronmcadam> one side effect is you may find the problem yourself whilst trying to reproduce
[11:31:14] <ShawnRisk> I have to go
[11:31:19] <ShawnRisk> thanks for the help again
[11:32:28] <_saw> Hi
[11:32:57] <droptimize> Hello
[11:33:34] <_saw> How do I build selector if I want to search for elements by name and value ? If I want to search only by name I use: $("input:checkbox[name=filter_category]")
[11:36:03] <phlp> [value="foo"] ?
[11:38:10] <pwf> my issue isn't being reproduced in my reproduction T_T
[11:38:10] <keyword> guys I have a question how can I get the url from a text?
[11:38:15] <pwf> i have learned nothing though
[11:39:06] <surfdue> keyword, look up the replace js function it uses regex
[11:39:48] <pwf> ah ha, found it
[11:40:12] <pwf> there's an element above it that has margin-top causing it to push down the sliding div
[11:40:21] <pwf> but why does it only happen when animating?
[11:40:23] <keyword> yeap I'm looking at, but for example I have the text "this is a nice page www.example.com see you" I want to get www.example.com
[11:42:11] <pwf> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/h6UjU/2/
[11:42:18] <pwf> click 'header crap' to show it
[11:42:26] <pwf> 'sitenav crap' to hide it
[11:42:51] <pwf> notice how the top jumps when it's done animating
[11:43:13] <pwf> if i remove margin-top from .currentUser then it goes away
[11:43:29] <pwf> but then my currentUser is ugly...
[11:44:53] <blindMoe> pwf: looks the same to me when margin-top is removed as far as appearance.. but the jump stops
[11:45:00] <blindMoe> also what about just switching it to padding
[11:45:10] <pwf> tried that, same thing happens
[11:45:15] <blindMoe> yeah
[11:45:22] <pwf> i'm going to add a height to currentUser, maybe that will stop it
[11:45:54] <pwf> yep that did it
[11:46:00] <pwf> thanks for the awesome jsfiddle link
[11:46:15] <phlp> pwf: you could also add overflow:hidden to #siteNavigation
[11:46:41] <pwf> eh... slightly less elegant. the user div should have it's height properly set anyways so it's an ok solution
[11:47:11] <phlp> actually setting the height to a pixel value is less elegant
[11:47:20] <pwf> true...
[11:47:42] <pwf> are there better ways to get that text vertically aligned without giving it a pixel margin value?
[11:47:48] <pwf> i think that would be best
[11:48:26] <Brodingo> line height?
[11:49:06] <pwf> possibly...
[11:49:19] <pwf> i need it to emulate what's going on with the left side's sitenav table
[11:49:26] <pwf> i guess i could just put it in that table somehow
[11:49:39] <f00bar80> i was using a form with post action="{$smarty.server.PHP_SELF}?a=add&pid={$pid}" and i was refering to this for example as mydomain.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&pid=27   after i've upgraded the script got jquery post as follow  >> jQuery.post("cart.php", 'ajax=1&a=add&pid={/literal}{$pid}{literal}&'+jQuery("#domainfrm").serialize(), , don't know how to refer to the page now .. any comment?
[11:51:15] <ryanneufeld> is there a service that I can use to format my code to meet the jquery standard?
[11:53:09] <keyword> how can I get url from text block "this is a nice page http://www.example.com/ see you" I want to get http://www.example.com/
[11:54:28] <bfred> is there a way to clone an input element without its new value?
[11:54:31] <phlp> keyword: http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls
[11:58:10] <keyword> phlp:  mmm this doesnt works
[11:58:49] <phlp> lies
[11:59:13] <keyword> I;m seeing in rubular.com
[11:59:59] <greenmanspirit> what is the string format for data sent with $.get, it just says string or map but doesnt explain what the string needs to be formated as
[12:00:27] <versatiletech> bfred: ?
[12:00:35] <ajpiano> greenmanspirit, a query string
[12:00:41] <ajpiano> foo=bar&baz=bat

[12:02:56] <Ar-ras> hi
[12:02:57] <savid> Does anyone know how to get the index of the selected tab in JqueryUI Tabs?
[12:03:06] <bfred> gnarf: is there a proper to get its initial state rather than .clone().val($(elem).attr('value'))?
[12:03:28] <JJMalina> something with a photo gallery, slider thing built in
[12:03:29] <Ar-ras> is it possible to add a function to a jquery object on the fly, so that have something like each(), but faster?
[12:03:59] <gnarf> bfred: store the initial state well before you clone is the other option, but the way you mentioned is prolly the way i'd solve it
[12:04:52] <supsup> savid: var selected = $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected');
[12:04:57] <Ar-ras> is it possible to add a function to a jquery object on the fly, so that have something like each(), but faster?
[12:05:07] <ajpiano> Ar-ras hu?
[12:05:15] <supsup> where tabs is the tab jquery object
[12:05:23] <ajpiano> you can add new functions to jQuery.fn and they will be aviallble on all jQuery objects
[12:05:35] <ajpiano> and theoretically yes you could add a function to an arbitrary jquery object but that doesn't seem portable
[12:05:43] <ajpiano> also..... each is pretty much fast enough for most things
[12:06:04] <supsup> savid you should check out the api @ http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...retrieve_the_index_of_the_currently_selected_tab
[12:06:07] <Ar-ras> ajpiano like this, but bypassing the function declartation
[12:06:12] <ajpiano> Ar-ras, also http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#each2
[12:06:27] <ajpiano> so you want to add a function to something without a function declaration
[12:06:31] <Ar-ras> yes
[12:06:33] <phlp> ?js "asdf http://www.example.com/ another example another.com and ftp.three.net".match(/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,4}\b(\/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)?/gi) @ keyword
[12:06:34] <bot-t> keyword: ["http://www.example.com/", "another.com", "ftp.three.net"]
[12:06:48] <ajpiano> Ar-ras: doesn't that sound like, impossible
[12:07:03] <Ar-ras> lol
[12:07:04] <Ar-ras> ok
[12:07:45] <keyword> phlp:  let me see
[12:07:57] <Ar-ras> because i want to boost the performance and one each seems to be the bottleneck
[12:08:16] <ajpiano> Ar-ras: you should refactor the contents of the function, not the loop construct itself
[12:08:42] <madprops> im trying to make the image close when i click on it, why would this not work? image = $('<img id="lbImage" />').click(close).appendTo(center)
[12:08:50] <ajpiano> .each is used inside of almost every jquery method, if you are experiencing a bottleneck in one loop, the logic you are doing is likely the problem, not the loop itself
[12:09:27] <datlap> i dont know why this wont highlight the selected tab. $('a[href="#recipient_manage"]').click(function() {document.location='/recipient_manage/';});
[12:09:28] <datlap> $(this).addClass("active");
[12:09:28] <datlap> });
[12:09:32] <datlap> any idea?
[12:10:07] <supsup> maprops: make jsfiddle, not sure what your tyring to do with that close function or what your appending it to exactly.
[12:10:42] <ajpiano> datlap, uh, cause you're navigation to another page?
[12:10:48] <ajpiano> navigating*
[12:11:58] <supsup> datlap u could add param to your location and then based on that set highlighting on next page
[12:12:09] <supsup> tho seems kinda ghetto
[12:12:31] <datlap> supsup:what is less ghetto?
[12:12:38] <supsup> Tupac
[12:12:48] <supsup> Biggy is mo
[12:13:05] <supsup> i don't know i'd prob have my backend dealing with the full navigation
[12:13:08] <supsup> personally
[12:13:22] <supsup> using some kind of metadata hiachery to file system structure
[12:13:47] <madprops> do images need to become links in order to be clickable?
[12:13:58] <supsup> no.
[12:14:40] <bfred> gnarf: nope, it's not getting its actual attribute but the property, even if jQuery is v1.6.1
[12:14:52] <bfred> same goes with .prop()
[12:15:09] <datlap> ajpiano: i just need to highlight a selected tab. but nothing is working
[12:15:38] <supsup> datlap when u go to a new page javascript frm the previous page does not follow you around unless you store it somehow
[12:15:45] <supsup> using params, or database etc
[12:16:15] <ajpiano> you can't do something on the page you're going to from the page you're leaving
[12:16:18] <gnarf> bfred: drop to the DOM: ele.getAttribute('value') ?
[12:16:21] <bateman> does jQuery have the inverse of $.parseJSON ?
[12:16:25] <ajpiano> bateman: no
[12:16:31] <ajpiano> bateman: see ?stringify
[12:16:32] <bot-t> bateman, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[12:16:41] <bateman> FML
[12:16:45] <bateman> what's with that?
[12:16:50] <datlap> ajpiano:what is the common way to do this then?
[12:17:03] <bateman> yeah, but i thought window.JSON wasn't cross browser
[12:17:31] <ajpiano> bateman: you polyfill it with JSON2
[12:17:32] <ajpiano> ?json2
[12:17:32] <bot-t> Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)
[12:17:46] <bfred> gnarf: that did it… now what's up with jQuery 1.6.1? didn't they change the behavior?
[12:18:10] <ajpiano> datlap, you have to assign the highlighted class when the tabs are loaded as the page is loaded
[12:18:12] <bateman> ok, thanks
[12:18:15] <supsup> document.location='/recipient_manage/?myhighlight=' + $(this),attr("href").;   <-- then on next page have some code looking at param and highlighting those hrefs matchs, or u could use hash instead
[12:18:22] <ajpiano> not assign it when the tab is cliked and then you force to the next page
[12:19:16] <supsup> prob id would be better to use tho
[12:19:25] <supsup> since only 1 id should exist on a page
[12:19:36] <datlap> supsup: seems like a lot of work just to highlight a tab
[12:19:38] <supsup> tho i've seen it plenty of times where people have decided that is not true
[12:19:42] <supsup> do work son
[12:20:00] <supsup> its like 1 line of code i don't really think thats a lot of work well dang i must work REALLY hard !!!
[12:20:06] <ajpiano> datlap: so does driving in a car compared to teleportation
[12:20:07] <supsup> i guess u were complimenting me thanks!
[12:20:12] <ajpiano> the difference is that one is possible and one is not
[12:20:25] <michaeldeol> @datlap are you trying to highlight a tab on the same page? Or are you trying to visit another page with a selected tab highlighted?
[12:20:39] <datlap> anoother page
[12:20:45] <supsup> he wants to highlight the page he is on.  prob could just do it based on current url also
[12:20:48] <keyword> phlp:  this works nice thans a lot
[12:21:18] <dcarper> any rails people in here? having a problem w/ jquery.form and the auth_token
[12:21:37] <phlp> keyword: np :)
[12:21:43] <datlap> all 3 pages have the same tabs. the contents are different
[12:21:55] <michaeldeol> @datlap you will want an event listener then on that page that is looking for a param in the url
[12:22:36] <supsup> datlap just make generic rule that looks at current url instead and then compares it to all the links inside your nav container fi they match add class selected
[12:22:46] <supsup> thats even easier prob better solution than passing around params
[12:23:18] <f00bar80> ppl any comment ?
[12:25:31] <datlap> supsup: i assumed this kind of things is built in jquery. since it seems like such a common problem that people have
[12:25:55] <ajpiano> datlap: impossible solutions to common problems are not "built into jquery"
[12:26:04] <supsup> the tools to do it are built in.
[12:26:10] <ajpiano> ^^
[12:26:48] <supsup> ajpiano can we put in feature request for jquery to be able to store commands after page redirect so we can chain future events on a pge we know nothing about??
[12:26:59] <supsup> i hear your in good with them jquery guys
[12:27:06] <ryanneufeld> is there a service that I can use to format my code to meet the jquery style guide?
[12:27:20] <ajpiano> yeah we can roll it into $.unicorn, right kborchers[A]
[12:27:21] <ajpiano> :p
[12:27:27] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: i don't know of one
[12:27:29] <kborchers[A]> heh
[12:27:34] <bfred> lol
[12:27:40] <ajpiano> i think most people use the "Get Yelled At By rwaldron" generator
[12:27:51] <ryanneufeld> haha
[12:27:53] <supsup> ooo nice AFK
[12:28:02] <ryanneufeld> yell at him to make one then :p
[12:28:28] <supsup> ajpiano prob with database storage assuming it's the same domain u prob could do something like that tho right/? (however bad of an idea it is)
[12:28:34] <kborchers> i'm still working on $.unicorn but it's coming along. running into a problem with with the horseshoesAndShamrocks() method though
[12:28:43] <ajpiano> if you stored it in localstorage or whatever yeah, you could do it
[12:29:14] <ajpiano> but the idea tht somehow jquery could generically handle it down to the actual link highlighting is obviously untenable
[12:30:09] <bfred> my $.unicorn is better
[12:30:21] <bfred> it shits rainbows
[12:30:27] <bfred> kinda like the nyan cat
[12:31:00] <freeed> ajpiano, hey does the rfp section on bocoup work for you guys? I like the idea.. like you're driving the rfp process.
[12:31:52] <ajpiano> you'd have to ask ppl who are a little bit more involved in handling the proposals
[12:31:58] <ajpiano> i just work on the projects :p
[12:32:27] <phlp> those are some large budgets
[12:33:05] <freeed> oh ok.. cool :) same here :) when we get rfps the clients act like total snobs, like we should be grovelling.. that rfp page you guys have flips that dynamic, super cool :D
[12:33:15] <datlap> supsup: i m pretty new w/ jquery but i didnt need to pass any params for the selected tab to be highlighted here. http://jsfiddle.net/xR2jt/

[12:36:02] <aaronmcadam> the way it should be
[12:36:19] <aaronmcadam> i think if you're up front about yours/their expectations from the start
[12:37:13] <freeed> yea.. but most of the places that send out rfps send them to like 20 firms and expect they all spend days putting together free proposals.. total bs
[12:37:15] <ajpiano> some ppl are up front about their expectations from the start, and then it is clear from the start that they are living in an alternate universe
[12:37:47] <aaronmcadam> ahaha :D

[12:38:50] <aaronmcadam> are you able to make it across the pond for full frontal adam?

[12:40:20] <ajpiano> ah don't believe i am :)
[12:40:25] <ajpiano> got a conf and a wedding the next weekend
[12:40:41] <aaronmcadam> aw alright :)
[12:40:49] <aichman2> hey guys can anyone help me out with setTimeout()
[12:40:51] <aaronmcadam> hopefully some jq team members will be there
[12:41:08] <aichman2> i'm trying to have a tooltip show after user hovers mouse over a link for 2 seconds
[12:41:35] <aichman2> brownie points will be awarded
[12:42:00] <ajpiano> ?fix hover @ aichman2
[12:42:00] <bot-t> aichman2, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[12:42:07] <gnarf> bfred: they did change the behavior, the problem is they pussied out and added a bunch of back compat shims to attr
[12:42:17] <gnarf> :)
[12:43:05] <bfred> oh, so it's as if nothing ever changed?
[12:43:09] <bfred> :(
[12:43:48] <ajpiano> aichman2: for reference though... var t = false;  $("#foo").mouseenter(function() {  t = setTimeout(function() { $("#tooltip").show();  }, 2000);   }).mouseleave(function() {  t && clearTimeout(t);   });
[12:44:24] <gnarf> you could prolly delete $.attrHooks.value and then it would work with .attr('value')

[12:45:00] <f00bar80> i was using a form with post action="{$smarty.server.PHP_SELF}?a=add&pid={$pid}" and i was refering to this for example as mydomain.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&pid=27   after i've upgraded the script got jquery post as follow  >> jQuery.post("cart.php", 'ajax=1&a=add&pid={/literal}{$pid}{literal}&'+jQuery("#domainfrm").serialize(), , don't know how to refer to the page now .. any comment?

[12:51:47] <pootpoot> how do i get the position of a div element so that i can absolutely position something on top of it?
[12:51:52] <jeffsmykil> i was hoping it was a robot that wrote my code for me, thanks for getting my hopes up nascro
[12:52:18] <nascro> @jeffsmykil it's quite the opposite, actually.
[12:52:24] <bateman> anyone know how i could select the text in a DOM element, without selecting the text in child elements? EG: just the contents of a li item, and not the span inside it
[12:52:37] <ajpiano> pootpoot: $(elem).offset()

[12:54:45] <jeffsmykil> freeed: setPagesDate($(this));
[12:55:03] <ajpiano> bateman: you would have to do $(elem).contents().filter(function() {  return this.nodeType === 3 }).text()

[12:56:58] <bot-t> ajpiano, Stored "beggin".
[12:57:00] <jeffsmykil> are you isnpired by cold hard counterfeit cash?
[12:57:08] <kborchers> nice
[12:58:01] <jeffsmykil> bah missing ) after formal parameters
[12:58:12] <Engin> "div>input" I'm triggering in div.click() I'm triggering input.click(). apparently input.click() also triggers its parent (div)'s click, so I'm exceeding call stack limit. stopPropagation avoids this but... input does not seem to be clicked.
[12:58:16] <nascro> @ajpiano remind me the link you sent yesterday (You bitch!)
[12:58:36] <ajpiano> hehe
[12:59:00] <Engin> hmm there's delagate... maybe it is desgiend for this
[12:59:12] <ajpiano> bot-t: ydms is http://forum.jquery.com/topic/you-destroyed-my-site
[12:59:13] <bot-t> ajpiano, Stored "ydms".
[12:59:47] <Engin> basically, I want to delagate clicks on a div to its child input.
[12:59:55] <nascro> @ajpiano  do you remember the link?
[13:00:02] <f00bar80> ajpiano, accessing the page i mean
[13:00:02] <ajpiano> nascro: it's right there ^^
[13:00:27] <nascro> I... um... totally knew that
[13:00:40] <ajpiano> Engin: event delegation involves reacting to events that have bubbled, not reacting to events that have bubbled and then firing them again on the elements that originally got the event
[13:01:03] <Engin> ajpiano: so, any neat solution ?
[13:01:10] <Engin> i can prevent with hacks but...
[13:01:11] <necromancer> can you find the height/width of the document on all browsers (IE 7+ specifically) using jQuery?
[13:01:12] <bateman> Engin: just call .click() on the item
[13:01:27] <ajpiano> Engin: don't bother binding a click handler to the input itself at all
[13:01:29] <jeffsmykil> necromancer: yes
[13:01:35] <ajpiano> just capture things with delegation on the parent and check the event.target
[13:02:07] <Engin> bateman: it triggers parent's .click() again... so it turns into a infinite loop
[13:02:22] <Engin> hmm
[13:02:59] <bateman> Engin: stop the bubbling from the child.
[13:03:00] <jeffsmykil> so dont put it in the parent put it over the parent?
[13:03:21] <Engin> bateman: that's what I did, but its functionailty is not tirggered (file dialog)
[13:03:48] <bateman> that's cause you return false
[13:03:48] <bateman> t
[13:03:55] <bateman> that stops the default action
[13:03:57] <bateman> use .bind("submit", function(event) {
[13:03:58] <bateman>   event.stopPropagation();
[13:03:58] <bateman> });
[13:04:49] <Engin> "div>input" input.click(funciton(e){e.stopPro..}); div.click(function(){input.click();}
[13:05:18] <Brodingo> feed me a stray cat
[13:05:28] <bateman> why are you binding to the parent anyway?
[13:05:38] <bateman> it's kinda convoluted
[13:05:41] <Engin> because that's how I want the interface to work.
[13:06:06] <Engin> actually, I can make the button big with that bg... so it would look same
[13:06:12] <Engin> but that is not very clean either.
[13:08:48] <Engin> hmm it onyl fails in chrome
[13:08:55] <Engin> ie and ff works as expected
[13:09:34] <Engin> hmmm
[13:11:01] <Engin> maybe chrome is doing this as a security precaution
[13:11:12] <dharaJShah> hi, I have a question about ajax post
[13:11:28] <dharaJShah> I'm using a submit button to post alli inputs to a url
[13:11:41] <dharaJShah> I want the response to post to the target id
[13:11:51] <dharaJShah> i'm not using forms
[13:11:55] <dharaJShah> is there someway i can do this?
[13:12:38] <dharaJShah> any ideas anyone?
[13:13:04] <Engin> aha ok
[13:13:14] <dharaJShah> seems like the post is not remembering the target i'm giving.
[13:13:14] <Engin> if input.style.display = none, then it won't work in chrome :)
[13:13:33] <hellyeah> hey
[13:13:45] <hellyeah> http://dpaste.com/587457/ what is wrong i nn that code
[13:13:56] <nascro> Anyone familiar with the JavaScript Tools TextMate Bundle?
[13:14:07] <nascro> https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle
[13:15:20] <kborchers> hellyeah: if i were to answer your question as vaguely as you asked it, i would say ... there is an error somewhere.
[13:15:47] <hellyeah> .F
[13:15:57] <nascro> @hellyeah that's the Nivo Slider plugin... did you make a change?
[13:16:07] <hellyeah> no
[13:16:43] <nascro> @hellyeah if it's the raw plugin then nothing is wrong with it.
[13:17:12] <nascro> @hellyeah but I can tell you changed it
[13:18:00] <hellyeah> what change
[13:18:07] <hellyeah> ?
[13:18:24] <nascro> @hellyeah you're asking what change you made to your own source?
[13:18:53] <hellyeah> i didnt change anything
[13:18:56] <hellyeah> in js file
[13:23:39] <f00bar80> my hosting provider said that mod_security blocked my ip cause i have cross-site-scripting in jquery.cookie.js , any comment ?
[13:27:34] <akavlie> I'm working on this app that's up to now been all server-side templating. I'm working on a new page with lots of JS manipulation, including adding new elements in a list without page refresh. Is there a good way to do this with the server-side template, or is it best to move templating to the front end?
[13:27:59] <ajpiano> tbranyen: ^^
[13:28:20] <kborchers> f00bar80: a little googling suggests that for what ever reason (maybe some pattern matching) causes that issue. Try changing the file name to jquery_cookie.js
[13:28:35] <tbranyen> ha
[13:28:40] <tbranyen> akavlie: i've been working on that
[13:28:42] <tbranyen> with backbone
[13:28:48] <tbranyen> its not ready yet
[13:29:35] <akavlie> tbranyen: hmm, what sort of solution do you have in mind?
[13:29:53] <tbranyen> akavlie: i use backbone in node and share the models, collections, views, routing, etc.
[13:29:58] <tbranyen> with pushState
[13:29:58] <multipass> hi, is there a way to get a link to auto trigger when page loads? its a facebook connect link that i want to auto trigger without the user clicking on it.. im trying .trigger('click'); with no luck
[13:30:21] <jsick3> does anyone happen to be familiar with the facebox plugin? i'm trying to have it disappear after a certain amount of time but can't seem to figure out what to do. i'm currently trying something like this: "jQuery.facebox('Text in the facebox popup').delay(300).trigger('close.facebox');"
[13:30:40] <akavlie> tbranyen: Ah, well this is a Java app with JSP templates, so that's not feasible here.
[13:30:48] <tbranyen> ah
[13:30:49] <necromancer> jsick3: yeah you just need to run $.facebox.close();
[13:30:51] <tbranyen> good luck heh
[13:30:54] <akavlie> hehe
[13:30:54] <necromancer> that's how you close it
[13:31:37] <necromancer> jsick3: i'd just do $.facebox('Text in the facebox popup'); setTimeout(function() { $.facebox.close() }, 300);
[13:31:39] <akavlie> tbranyen: in other areas we have the server pushing back the chunk of html in the AJAX response, but I want to move away from that approach, and I only know the front-end on this project.
[13:31:51] <necromancer> jsick3: although that '300' is 300 ms, which is really not a lot of time to read anything :)
[13:32:01] <jsick3> necromancer: yeah i am just trying to make it work first
[13:32:07] <jsick3> necromancer: ill try out what you just said
[13:32:07] <necromancer> oh ok
[13:32:18] <necromancer> i wasn't sure if .delay() and setTimeout used the same time measurement
[13:32:20] <akavlie> tbranyen: I've done cloning and modifying values for other operations, but that will get tedious for larger chunks of html.
[13:32:25] <jsick3> necromancer: yeah i think they do
[13:32:30] <necromancer> setTimeout's a pure JS function and extremely useful
[13:32:53] <tbranyen> akavlie: http://loft.bocoup.com/tim-branyen-jquery-templates/
[13:32:58] <tbranyen> i kind of discuss sharing templates in that talk
[13:33:07] <kborchers> multipass: you can't trigger the default functionality of a link, just its click handler. does that link actually leave your site or just fire some JS. you could just fire the JS yourself rather than trigger the click
[13:33:23] <ajpiano> akavlie: you could use an approach of using an ajax requests to load in templates
[13:33:41] <ajpiano> and then serve your initial templates all grouped together and init at load time
[13:33:58] <ajpiano> and then in your app you request json instead of html...
[13:34:16] <jsick3> necromancer: that works :D
[13:34:24] <akavlie> ajpiano: using AJAX to load in chunks of html rendered server side?
[13:34:28] <jsick3> necromancer: thanks a ot
[13:34:29] <jsick3> lot*
[13:34:32] <necromancer> no problem jsick3
[13:35:06] <ajpiano> akavlie: well, that's what you're doing now
[13:35:17] <ajpiano> right?
[13:35:28] <akavlie> right, so I guess I misunderstood your suggestion.
[13:36:15] <Jameslee> hi everyone
[13:36:25] <Jameslee> i'm having a strange issue....
[13:36:35] <Jameslee> i'm using, $.getJSON('/api/Admin/method/todaysSubmissionCount/json', function(res){
[13:36:37] <Jameslee> to get a response
[13:36:44] <Jameslee> when I console.log the res
[13:36:55] <Jameslee> i get back an object with a count property
[13:36:58] <akavlie> ajpiano: by "using ajax requests to load in templates" what do you mean?
[13:37:05] <Jameslee> by when i access the count property, the value is undefined
[13:37:14] <Jameslee> in the console.log, it shows the right value
[13:37:30] <akavlie> getting json data via ajax and rendering the template in JS?
[13:37:47] <Jameslee> output from console.log( res );
[13:37:48] <Jameslee> [
[13:37:48] <Jameslee> Object
[13:37:48] <Jameslee> SUBMISSION_COUNT: "60"
[13:37:48] <Jameslee> __proto__: Object
[13:37:48] <Jameslee> ]
[13:38:09] <Jameslee> how ever, console.log( res.SUBMISSION_COUNT ) will return undefined
[13:38:14] <Jameslee> any idea why?
[13:38:17] <ajpiano> akavlie: basically, at the top of your app, you would do $.get("aPageThatReturnsYourTemplates", function(templates) { compileTemplates(templates);    initTheRestOfTheApp();  });
[13:38:44] <ajpiano> and assuming (and it's a big assumption) that you have a client side templating engine that will work well with the templates you already have.... then you'd be golden
[13:39:10] <savid> Is there a quick way in javascript to get encoded url parameters from a dict?
[13:39:41] <Jameslee> anybody have any tips on debuggin this?
[13:39:54] <freeed> JamesLee, what about console.log(res['SUBMISSION_COUNT']) ?
[13:39:55] <ajpiano> savid: jQuery.param(obj);
[13:40:08] <Jameslee> get an error
[13:40:22] <freeed> JamesLee.. and the error is?
[13:40:45] <hizenberg> can someone take a look at my code, im trying to do a toggle with width and for some reason its not working
[13:40:47] <hizenberg> http://jsfiddle.net/W42E5/
[13:40:55] <Jameslee> freed: Uncaught ReferenceError: SUBMISSION_COUNT is not define
[13:41:38] <freeed> JamesLee, mm.. dunno then :)
[13:41:41] <Jameslee> lol
[13:41:42] <Jameslee> yea
[13:41:45] <Jameslee> i'm not understanding this
[13:42:02] <freeed> well if it helps.. it's doing exactly what you're telling it to :)
[13:42:10] <akavlie> ajpiano: Server side is JSP. So I was thinking of doing the templates in Mustache.
[13:42:15] <ajpiano> Jameslee: i think you have an object inside of an array
[13:42:22] <ajpiano> res[0].SUBMISSION_COUNT
[13:42:32] <akavlie> ajpiano: In which case, I'll probably just put the template right in the JS as a string at this stage.
[13:42:41] <phlp> hizenberg: should be $('.see-comments')
[13:42:48] <ajpiano> akavlie: fwiw, i'd recommend handlebars over mustache
[13:42:55] <ajpiano> similar syntax but way more expressive and less... brutal
[13:43:05] <Jameslee> ooooooooooooooo
[13:43:06] <Jameslee> you are right
[13:43:08] <Jameslee> thanks so much
[13:43:14] <Jameslee> hate myself.
[13:43:18] <ajpiano> akavlie: and IMHO it's really nice to be able to write the templates inside of a .html file instead of js
[13:43:26] <ajpiano> but yeah, not doing that does save you the request
[13:43:30] <akavlie> ajpiano: oh yeah? Can you give an example of what makes it better?
[13:44:06] <hizenberg> phlp: i tried that before and it didnt help
[13:44:16] <hizenberg> i updated the code so you can see it http://jsfiddle.net/W42E5/1/
[13:44:21] <akavlie> ajpiano: I may move to that approach if need be, but for now I'm going to start with a single iterable box that won't be so large in itself. Not moving the entire template over.
[13:44:24] <ajpiano> akavlie: helpers, partials, custom blocks.... you can actually iterate and object and get the key name instead of converted objects to arrays of objects with name, value keys :/
[13:44:46] <ajpiano> mustache, IIRC, forces you to do the latter :/
[13:44:56] <phlp> hizenberg: http://jsfiddle.net/W42E5/2
[13:46:03] <hizenberg> what was changed if you dont mind me asking
[13:46:06] <hizenberg> i dont see it
[13:46:28] <phlp> you dont need <script> in the javascript box
[13:46:54] <hizenberg> im using it on a php file instead of a js file
[13:47:13] <phlp> im only talking about jsfiddle.net
[13:47:47] <akavlie> ajpiano: hmm, actually I kinda like the approach of putting it in <script> tags within the JSP, then I can keep it within the template rather than a JS string.
[13:48:00] <akavlie> ajpiano: I imagine it will throw off my syntax highlighting though
[13:48:07] <hizenberg> ok
[13:48:16] <hizenberg> this is the site im using it on http://50.23.131.222/~urban/urbantest/
[13:48:54] <ajpiano> akavlie: yeah, cause it tries to highlight whatevers inside the <script> as script
[13:48:56] <hizenberg> even with it being .see-comments it still doesnt work
[13:49:35] <akavlie> ajpiano: but at least it will keep template stuff all in one place.
[13:49:49] <ajpiano> akavlie: also once you start keeping the templates separate, you can theoretically keep them in separate files and then load them in concatted, so it really opens a lot in terms of keeping things organised
[13:49:50] <ajpiano> heh
[13:50:00] <ajpiano> if that's your goal then yes :)
[13:50:16] <krazyj> HEY everyone... i'm trying to use Jail to lazy load some images (https://github.com/sebarmeli/JAIL/blob/master/jail.js) and, when i try to .append an HTML string with my images to my website when document ready, Jail doesn't find these images. i have a feeling it's something with jquery DOM addition and detection of those elements... any ideas?
[13:50:17] <crankharder> is there some rule against slideing a table?
[13:50:40] <crankharder> ...cause instead of a slide effect I get insta-hide/show
[13:52:10] <akavlie> ajpiano, tbranyen: thanks for all your help.
[13:52:13] <akavlie> gotta go
[13:52:14] <phlp> hizenberg: at the top of the page you have ('iframe') and it should be $('iframe')
[13:52:21] <ajpiano> later
[13:53:18] <krazyj> when doing a .append... how can i get jQuery to include added elements in the 'this' special variable?
[13:54:01] <ajpiano> huh
[13:54:06] <hizenberg> thanks but do you see my toggle code by the videos?
[13:54:14] <ajpiano> this isn't a "special variable" :p
[13:54:16] <phlp> hizenberg: also even though you put a script tag by each '.see-comments' they are all selecting every instance of '.see-comments'
[13:54:38] <krazyj> so, after the document is ready, i'm adding a string of HTML with .append to a div
[13:54:52] <krazyj> then, in a separate script, im trying to get a list of images (what i'm adding in the string) using the 'this' keyword
[13:54:57] <hizenberg> so you think because they have the same instance is the problem?
[13:54:58] <krazyj> however, it's not getting the images
[13:55:25] <ajpiano> is that code happening *after* the html has been appended?
[13:55:43] <krazyj> i believe so
[13:55:44] <draginx> http://pastie.org/private/mi1rd3zqklq6vjyk85axw I have data that looks like: Object: 1: "1", 2: "1" how can I pass that into the ajax call?
[13:55:44] <phlp> hizenberg: you need to setup the toggle event once (selecting all see-comments) then find what you want to animate relative to whichever instance was clicked
[13:55:56] <krazyj> ajpiano: any quick ways to force that?
[13:56:18] <krazyj> ajpiano: actually, i executed the function AFTER the $.get which gets the string so, yes
[13:56:32] <krazyj> ($.get gets/appends the string in the callback)
[13:56:40] <ajpiano> draginx jQuery.param( object )
[13:56:47] <ajpiano> um
[13:56:57] <ajpiano> "after" ie, you do it in the callback
[13:57:05] <gf3> ?eval $.param
[13:57:06] <bot-t> gf3: <function (a, traditional) {var s = [];if (traditional === undefined) {traditional = jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional;}if (jQuery.isArray(a) || a.jquer...
[13:57:07] <ajpiano> or do you not know about ajax and how it is asynchronous etc etc
[13:57:09] <gf3> oh shi-
[13:57:30] <gf3> ?eval $.param({ your: "dick", my: "mouth" })
[13:57:30] <bot-t> gf3: "your=dick&my=mouth"
[13:57:32] <phlp> hizenberg: for example instead of video-inside5 give them all the class video-inside then in the see-comments toggle event do $(this).closest('.video-inside') to get the one that contains what was clicked
[13:57:39] <ajpiano> gf3 did i just break the ipad of your mind
[13:58:06] <gf3> ajpiano: you literally smashed it, and as it turns out, my case was not strong enough
[13:58:19] <ajpiano> revenge is sweet.
[13:58:29] <draginx> ajpiano: thats it! thank you sir
[13:58:36] <gf3> ajpiano: I'm not through with you…
[13:58:43] * ajpiano will never sleep again
[14:01:00] <davebs> hey, if i've got an onchange event inline and i want to assign that same event to another object, can i just do something like $('new_obj').attr('click',$('old_obj').attr('onchange')) ?
[14:01:12] <warz> hi all. im catching keyup events, but wanting to bail out if the key is in a certain set of keys. for some reason, the code is continuing to execute beyond my return false line. anyone know how to properly exit out of this code statement early? here's the code: http://dpaste.com/587494/
[14:01:20] <soulcutter> I'm looking at the docs on toggle() ( http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ ) and I'm experiencing an issue... $('#foo').toggle('fast', 'fold') gives me an error, while $('#foo').toggle('fold', 'fast') does not.
[14:01:29] <warz> im trying to simply return false, but that doesn't seem to be stopping it.
[14:01:34] <draginx> davebs: i dont see why not give it a go? :)
[14:01:34] <soulcutter> The docs indicate that the duration is the first argument, though - is this a documentation error?
[14:01:53] <warz> line 3, btw.
[14:01:55] <draginx> soulcutter: "fast" might be a jquery keyword?
[14:02:01] <soulcutter> or have the order of the args changed in different versions?
[14:02:06] <draginx> although i dont think theres a toggle slow lol
[14:02:14] <soulcutter> you can toggle slow
[14:02:20] <draginx> ah ok well then thats ur problem
[14:02:23] <soulcutter> duration can be 'fast', 'slow', or a number of millis
[14:02:23] <davebs> draginx, thanks, guess i'll find out :)
[14:02:27] <draginx> slow/fast ar eduration keywords :)
[14:02:38] <draginx> so rename ur class to something else (or do fold,fast
[14:02:39] <soulcutter> draginx: I don't think you're understanding the issue
[14:02:39] <philosophically> $.load is not working for me in IE8, not loading anything and bringing error: 'null' is null or not an object.. i tried adding a random number to the url to prevent caching, tried using the following meta tags: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />
[14:02:39] <philosophically>   <meta http-equiv="Cache-control" content="no-cache"> ... the code that i am loading doesn't seem to have any problems and i just don't know what to do...
[14:03:12] <soulcutter> draginx: my issue is that the docs say duration is the first argument. My experimentation shows that it only works as the second argument
[14:03:13] <hizenberg> phlp: each comment has its own instance now but still it doesnt animate, do you have one more suggestion i can do?
[14:03:24] <soulcutter> (if an easing method is used)
[14:03:50] <draginx> soulcutter: i believe if ur using duration as first argument the second argument is a function?
[14:04:13] <soulcutter> draginx: I actually tried it using the three-arg version also
[14:04:18] <soulcutter> with an empty function
[14:04:29] <soulcutter> draginx: it DOES work with 2 args, neither of them functions
[14:04:35] <soulcutter> the docs just seem... wrong
[14:04:37] <draginx> thats weird =/
[14:05:21] <soulcutter> yeah, I agree
[14:07:26] <phlp> hizenberg: it's hard to say what the problem is. you are loading multiple versions of jquery and prototype and some other stuff. jquery doesnt even seem to be defined on the page. you need to clean it up
[14:08:41] <hizenberg> jquery does work on there
[14:08:56] <hizenberg> click select artist and you see that it does width on that
[14:09:09] <hizenberg> but however for some reason its not working on the comments area
[14:10:03] <phlp> that is using prototype
[14:10:35] <hizenberg> let me disable it and see]
[14:10:47] <hizenberg> maybe they are conflicting
[14:11:18] <hizenberg> yeah that seems to be the problem
[14:12:48] <hizenberg> is there a way to make them not conflict with each other?
[14:13:27] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict
[14:14:03] <hizenberg> i forget, do i add this to the file or to my script?
[14:14:09] <hizenberg> the jquery file i mean
[14:14:40] <phlp> the jquery that is added by wordpress has it at the end of the file. but you have included jquery twice
[14:15:03] <soulcutter> side-note: open is an event type that browsers recognize, even though it's not in the list of standard event types in the jquery bind docs
[14:15:11] <soulcutter> good to know!
[14:15:45] <hizenberg> the jquery in wordpress doesnt seem to work with my script
[14:16:08] <phlp> which script?
[14:16:39] <hizenberg> the comments one
[14:17:04] <hizenberg> you can see now i took jquery out and tried with the wordpress one
[14:17:13] <phlp> that's because when you use noConflict you have to use jQuery instead of $
[14:17:15] <hizenberg> and now nothing using jquery functions
[14:18:17] <hizenberg> cant i use something like jquery.noconflict = $ and add it to my script?
[14:19:15] <phlp> what you need to do is just pick jquery or prototype and stick to that. if you are keeping prototype around for that sidebar it's not worth it
[14:19:29] <orplac> quick question: say you have a stack of divs that have the same class, if i were to use the .append and .prepend functions to add 1 div above or after the top/bottom one, will the functions do it?
[14:20:03] <orplac> from what i have read, it seems they either select an element to duplicate, or add to all elements that have that class/id
[14:20:11] <orplac> correct me if i wrong :D
[14:20:15] <phlp> hizenberg: plus the page is incredibly slow i thought my browser crashed the first time i loaded it. you need to trim some fat
[14:20:55] <peol> orplac: If you use .append('<div>markup here</div>') it'll add to all, otherwise it'll add to the first one, a DOM element can only be at one place :p
[14:21:20] <peol> or wait, don't quote me on that one
[14:21:24] <hizenberg> lol yeah i told them that adding all those videos on there at once like that would do that
[14:21:57] <hizenberg> well im gonna take the hard way on this one and just use no conflict
[14:22:24] <peol> orplac: yeah, if you .append markup, it'll add to all elements in your collection
[14:22:31] <phlp> that's the easy way. the hard way would be rewriting the small piece of code that uses prototype so you can get rid of it
[14:23:02] <orplac> hmm, well i only want it to append or prepend to the top or bottom of the stack
[14:23:05] <orplac> not the ones in the middle
[14:23:09] <hizenberg> lol i dont have that much experince with jquery to do that
[14:23:16] <orplac> kinda like facebook notifcation style
[14:24:45] <hizenberg> and thank you phlp, i really appreciate it
[14:25:02] <phlp> yep ;)
[14:25:19] <warz> why does "1 in [1,2,3]" evaluate to true, but "16 in [16,17,18]" evaluate to false?
[14:25:34] <ccmonster> hola.
[14:25:57] <ccmonster> i cant find the ben almans bbq example that uses the /#/ custom event
[14:26:05] <orplac> peol: no worries my man, i have discovered a design workaround :D 'ppreciate it tho!
[14:26:06] <ccmonster> anyone got any direction there..?
[14:26:08] <gnarf> warz: because you're looking at properties, not values
[14:26:25] <gnarf> ?js "omg" in { omg: true }
[14:26:26] <bot-t> gnarf: true
[14:26:30] <gnarf> ?js "omg" in { notomg: true }
[14:26:31] <bot-t> gnarf: false
[14:26:38] <warz> ah.
[14:26:41] <gnarf> if you want to look at values
[14:26:45] <gnarf> see ?jQuery.inArray
[14:26:45] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[14:27:04] <hizenberg> ohh one more question
[14:27:34] <hizenberg> do you know how i can make my page stop jumping to the top when i click on my sidebar or comments?
[14:28:41] <phlp> hizenberg: that's caused by the href="#" you can use e.preventDefault() http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault
[14:28:54] <SEJeff> How do you do a logical OR with a css selector?
[14:29:01] <hizenberg> ok thanks
[14:29:07] <ajpiano> SEJeff: $("foo,bar");
[14:29:09] <SEJeff> Can you do: $("#some_id").find("input|select")
[14:29:12] <SEJeff> ajpiano, thanks
[14:31:42] <ProLoser|Work> why is it if i inspect the dom after removing an attribute i still see the attribute?
[14:31:47] <ProLoser|Work> i thought i would visibly see it dissappear?
[14:33:08] <ProLoser|Work> removeAttr() doesn't appear to be working with 'data-include'
[14:33:13] <ccmonster> hey ajpiano , do you know ben alman's bbq well?
[14:33:28] <ajpiano> i've never like built an app with it, personally
[14:33:32] <ccmonster> I am looking to implement it, and I'm probably going to have to convert some things.
[14:33:34] <ajpiano> i know it's pretty f'ing solid
[14:33:41] <ccmonster> Yea, that's what I hear.
[14:33:49] <dabear> SO IS YOUR MOM, ajpiano
[14:34:02] <dabear> f'ing and solid that is
[14:34:07] <ccmonster> basically, im passed a ?cat=CategoryName parameter, and depending on that cat, i ajax load a certain page. if the user (via a ui-menu) selects a different category, I want to change the url (the cat=NewCatName) and then load the new respective via ajax. I need back support. So I'm not sure what the best route is
[14:34:11] <ccmonster> errr...
[14:34:13] <ccmonster> lol
[14:34:35] <ProLoser|Work> would caching a query like $this = $(this) mean that removeAttr() won't be reflected into the dom?
[14:34:40] <ccmonster> i want to implement the bbq haschange/history within that scenario
[14:34:58] <ccmonster> $this=$(this) is awesome :)
[14:35:03] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work, removeAttr really just leaves the html with an empty attribute, that's just how it is
[14:35:06] <dabear> ccmonster: then you wouldn't use ?cat, but #cat=
[14:35:07] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:35:11] <dabear> or something like that
[14:35:27] <ccmonster> dabear, yea, but I have other parameters as well
[14:35:32] <dabear> ignore silly bot :p
[14:35:38] <ajpiano> ccmonster: i imagine you'd be able to get clever with the querysting parsing
[14:35:44] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: no way to delete the attribute? i am selecting dom using $([data-include]) but i want to be able to execute the code multiple times without re-running it on code that already got processed
[14:35:44] <Itrace> I'm using setInterval to run a function that animates some divs, like a slider on the homepage of a website. When I switch to a different tab in my browser then go back to the main tab the set interval function fires a bunch of times. How can I stop this?
[14:35:47] <ProLoser|Work> any suggestions?
[14:35:57] <ccmonster> and would using bbq mean that links to anchors on a page cause bbq to handle those as well
[14:36:12] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work, use .data() to mark the data you've already processed
[14:36:17] <ajpiano> and filter it out by that
[14:36:27] <ProLoser|Work> how would i select my dataset then?
[14:36:38] <phlp> $('[data-include!=""]')
[14:36:46] <ProLoser|Work> thanks
[14:36:53] <ajpiano> or .filter()
[14:36:55] <ProLoser|Work> but wouldn't that also give me ones that don't have data-include?
[14:37:00] <ajpiano> god forbid you can't use a selector for everything!!!!!!!
[14:37:07] <ccmonster> ha
[14:37:39] <ccmonster> someone mentioned earlier that I could use some custom thing that is in bbq regarding /#/ or something, but I cant find it
[14:37:59] <dabear> ccmonster: I guess you could use location.href.replace
[14:38:04] <phlp> i think they were talking about jquery mobile
[14:38:09] <orplac> what should the format of the return be (not the return data) when passing a ajax request thorugh it? it seems like it doesnt want to give me any data back....
[14:38:18] <ccmonster> ah phlp you might be right.
[14:38:19] <orplac> fyi, im simply returning a string
[14:38:24] <ajpiano> $("[data-include]").each(function() { var t  = $(this); if (!t.data("instance") {  t.data("instance", new Instance(this));   }   });
[14:38:38] <orplac> and using html for the dataType
[14:38:45] <ProLoser|Work> instance?
[14:38:53] <ccmonster> not sure what the jquery mobile was brought up for then.
[14:38:58] <ProLoser|Work>  /s/instance/include/ ?
[14:39:18] <ajpiano> no i'm assuming you are doing some simple object instantiation, you could be doing any sort of processing
[14:39:30] <ajpiano> the bottom line is "store a flag in data, check for it, otherwise, do the processing"
[14:39:40] <philosophically> can anyone help? .load not working in ie8 mykazoo.tv drag the red scroller on the left hand side down to "new" category, not loading content, works fine in every other browser
[14:40:10] <ajpiano> philosophically: usually when load doesn't work in IE but works in every other browser it means your HTML is malformed, please check for that
[14:40:20] <hooloovoo> Yo! Anyone know if .fadeIn() is a blockign function?
[14:40:25] <hooloovoo> Cause it sure seems like it...
[14:40:47] <ajpiano> it certainly isn't
[14:40:53] <philosophically> ajpiano: what could be wrong with the html? i check it on firefox and it doesnt seem bad...
[14:41:06] <ajpiano> philosophically: anything
[14:41:14] <philosophically> ajpiano: lol
[14:41:16] <ajpiano> "doesn't seem bad" is about as convincing as the dog ate my homework
[14:41:19] <ajpiano> :p
[14:41:19] <ProLoser|Work> GAH
[14:41:22] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting such a headache
[14:41:39] <ProLoser|Work> http://pastebin.com/KnDnRFdy
[14:41:44] <ajpiano> ccmonster: have you like, looked at the documentation at all??
[14:42:02] <ProLoser|Work> removeData() isn't working, removeAttr() isn't working. and the attr() is alerting only the LAST attribute of the dataset
[14:42:02] <ajpiano> it's clear there's a bunch of methods for parsing the querystring as well
[14:42:05] <ProLoser|Work> WHY?
[14:42:24] <ajpiano> lol glboal $this
[14:42:31] <ProLoser|Work> ...
[14:42:36] <ProLoser|Work> so var $this =
[14:43:08] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work, don't mishmash everything you hear together
[14:43:22] <ProLoser|Work> so what should i do?
[14:43:28] <ajpiano> you don't need to like, take his thing, then do my filter technique using his selector and then start removing data and attributes all over the place
[14:43:39] <ajpiano> gimme a sec i will write it up
[14:43:40] <brianpWins> is there a method to find out how many functions have been binded to a particular object?
[14:44:01] <phlp> philosophically: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fmykazoo.tv%2Fnew-releases&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[14:44:19] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: i woulda used his selector, but i'm afraid [data-include!=""] would give me elements without the data-include attr altogether
[14:44:26] <sravan> Hi guys
[14:44:37] <ajpiano> yeah but you just need to get to the actual solution, not just try everythign all at once :)

[14:49:04] <h0st1le> maybe im missing something really easy here but if i do something like this:
[14:49:08] <h0st1le> $('#form').submit(function(data) { });
[14:49:25] <h0st1le> it occurs before the actual submission, how can i actually get the response object?
[14:50:20] <peol> h0st1le: yeah, that's an event, which means you can cancel the submit
[14:50:32] <peol> h0st1le: if you want the response data, you need to do an ajax request

[15:02:33] <bot-t> ajpiano, Bocoup - http://bocoup.com/
[15:02:34] <Engin> what is the guaranteed way of getting an images size ? .load does not always work
[15:02:56] <ProLoser|Work> what's the biggest... company you did a project for?
[15:04:18] <ajpiano> i mostly work on startuppy ideas since i've been here, we've done work with like newsweek and google and such
[15:05:04] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work besides i save most of these pastes so i can use em examples later

[15:07:22] <phlp> haha i like the BAD EXAMPLES
[15:07:54] <ajpiano> there's only that one, it's so.... good

[15:07:57] <Itrace> How do you stop a setInterval function from running when your in a different tab in your browser? Or is there a jQuery equivalent to setInterval that I could use?

[15:10:18] <droptimize> nivo was a bit of a CF... difficult to drop into an existing project
[15:16:58] <sravan> How to make my javascript code work in ajax loaded content?
[15:17:39] <droptimize> sravan, you can't send <script> blocks via ajax.
[15:17:46] <SEJeff> sravan, Is that javascript code wrapped in $(document).ready or something like that?
[15:18:19] <sravan> SEJeff: I can have wrapped in $(document).ready
[15:18:28] <sravan> or I can have it outside as well
[15:18:35] <Engin> I'm inserting a iframe with a unique name, .submit() my form targetteed at it. works on chrome and ff and not on IE. any ideas ?
[15:18:47] <droptimize> sravan, does your ajax content contain a "<script>"  block/code?
[15:18:47] <Engin> the form is not submitted on IE
[15:18:48] <SEJeff> sravan, If it isn't executing and it *is* in document.ready, take it out for the ajax
[15:19:10] <SEJeff> I've got a few templates that have the document.ready wrapped inside of {% if request.is_ajax %} in some django apps of mine
[15:19:35] <gnarf> SEJeff: that shouldn't matter
[15:19:40] <SEJeff> sravan, Because a page loaded via ajax is by definition going to be loaded after $(document).ready fires
[15:19:42] <gnarf> if the doc is already ready, it immediately firest
[15:19:44] <SEJeff> gnarf, It does in safari
[15:19:50] <SEJeff> gnarf, doesn't always
[15:19:56] <gnarf> SEJeff: then thats a jQuery bug
[15:20:06] <gnarf> SEJeff: and you should document it and file a ticket
[15:20:10] <SEJeff> gnarf, I was using jquery-ui tabs to pull in a page
[15:20:35] <SEJeff> content on that page wouldn't fire if it was wrapped in $(document).ready in 1 of the 4 browsers I was testing in and I'm 90% certain it was safari
[15:20:38] <gnarf> if the document has been ready - $( fn ) should call fn immediately
[15:21:13] <sravan> I have two tabs - first tab is loaded when page is loaded and when I click on 2nd tab simiar html (to 1st tab) is loaded via ajax but jquery plugin and other stuff related JS isnt working
[15:21:31] <droptimize> i notice a lot n00bs try and put <script> do_foo(); </script> wont work over ajax
[15:21:46] <gnarf> droptimize: yes it will if you append the html correctly
[15:21:55] <necromancer> droptimize: it does work sometimes :)
[15:21:58] <gnarf> droptimize: if you append the html directly to the DOM -- it works
[15:22:03] <necromancer> but it's not to be trusted and it's generally bad practice
[15:22:04] <droptimize> ah, fancy
[15:22:18] <necromancer> if you're doing an ajax call, what's stopping you from just putting that JS in the callback?
[15:22:24] <droptimize> so simply attaching it to a div wont work?
[15:22:59] <gnarf> droptimize: $( html ).appendTo( div ) and $( div ).append( html ) both will execute scripts
[15:23:02] <sravan> necromancer: is it for me?
[15:23:20] <gnarf> the difference is $( html ) isn't inside the DOM, so if you are searching for elements that are in that html, it wont find them
[15:23:55] <gnarf> where if you do div.append( html ) and div is in the dom, the scripts will prolly work right
[15:24:21] <gnarf> but yeah, that whole conversation is tangental to the issue which is passing <script> tags in the html isn't the best practice
[15:24:51] <gnarf> you should instead make a function that is called when you load the content, and put the script needed in there
[15:25:15] <gnarf> ?newContent
[15:25:16] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[15:25:22] <gnarf> thats my generic use solution
[15:26:05] <znow> hey, im using jquery lightBox on a rails project. the images doesnt seem to load in the lightbox window, the loader gif is just continuing.. I got a class on the link of the image
[15:26:33] <necromancer> sravan: nah it wasn't intended for you. but are you doing inline <script> tags in those ajax-called HTML files?
[15:26:51] <Engin> I can't programatically submit a form if it is targetted at an iframe in IE
[15:26:53] <Engin> any ideas ?
[15:27:37] <sravan> I have tabs setup with which loads ajax content based on href
[15:27:52] <necromancer> right, but do you have <script> tags in that ajax content?
[15:28:17] <Engin> necromancer: me ? yes I have script
[15:28:34] <necromancer> nah sravan
[15:28:41] <sravan> Now I removed all javascript and trying to bind those new elements that got added to the new tab
[15:28:53] <necromancer> try this
[15:28:57] <necromancer> sravan: https://gist.github.com/1003630
[15:29:01] <necromancer> just saw that newContent
[15:29:05] <uptownben> Hey al
[15:29:07] <necromancer> give that a shot, might be what you want
[15:29:08] <uptownben> all
[15:29:22] <gnarf> if you are just binding events
[15:29:28] <gnarf> and don't need anything other than the event handle
[15:29:38] <gnarf> see ?.live
[15:29:38] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:29:42] <sravan> http://jsfiddle.net/7m2Kz/ something like this makes sense?
[15:29:43] <gnarf> or see ?.delegate
[15:29:44] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:30:24] <brianpWins> how do i tell an event not to bubble of the dom tree?
[15:30:39] <gnarf> brianpWins: use event.stopPropagation
[15:30:47] <brianpWins> gnarf: thank you!
[15:30:51] <gnarf> ?event.stopPropagation
[15:30:52] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[15:31:32] <uptownben> I need to assign multiple functions to an event (element.change()), I thought that with Jquery 1.5.x I could just do elementname.change(newfunction()), multiple times with different functions and they would all execute on the change event, is this not the case?
[15:33:21] <akavlie> ajpiano: Yo, you're the one I was discussing templating with right? Got another question.
[15:33:59] <ajpiano> yessir
[15:34:21] <brianpWins> gnarf: in the case of an input field if i stop propagation in a keyup on a textfield the characters never get typed. I just don't want it to proagate to the .change call on the form itself
[15:34:50] <akavlie> ajpiano: Let's say the whole template is in Handlebars, with a for loop of comment divs. So I render that initially, but then when a user makes a comment, I want to add another one to the page. How would I do that?
[15:35:06] <akavlie> ajpiano: I can't just use the whole template again, I want the specific chunk that pertains to a single comment.
[15:36:11] <ajpiano> you'd need to have that as a distinct template, i believe, at least on the client side
[15:36:41] <ajpiano> what you'd want to do in handlebars was have a partial for the actual content
[15:36:51] <ajpiano> which you can use as the template for new items
[15:37:06] <ajpiano> and then a template that calls that in a for loop, for when you're initially doing it
[15:37:17] <ajpiano> http://thinkvitamin.com/code/handlebars-js-part-2-partials-and-helpers/
[15:37:22] <akavlie> ajpiano: OK, I don't see mention of partials.
[15:37:51] <ajpiano> yeah it's a little underdcocumented, i just know it's there cause i found that article and kinda abstractly had heard it was there
[15:38:16] <gnarf> brianpWins: if you're just trying to stop the change event, i think its possible to set the .val(function(_,val) { return val }) and that stops the change event, but i'm not 100% sure
[15:39:05] <gnarf> change events dont fire when you use js to set the value, so if you set the value to the same thing it is going to be before the change event, it does that
[15:39:07] <gnarf> but anyway
[15:39:21] <gnarf> if you want to stop bubbling on "change" stop the bubble in the change event, not the keypress
[15:39:27] <akavlie> ajpiano: Ah, I see. Looks like mustache is the same.
[15:39:38] <ajpiano> ah
[15:40:03] <uptownben> so can I assign multiple functions to an event?
[15:40:19] <ajpiano> yup
[15:43:48] <uptownben> How can I assign multiple functions to an event in JQuery 1.5?
[15:44:15] <gnarf> .click( fn1 ).click( fn2 )
[15:44:16] <ajpiano> call bind more than once
[15:46:16] <uptownben> can I do .change(makeFunction()); where makeFunction() returns a new function based on some non-related parameters? and do that in a loop?
[15:47:29] <brianpWins> im not totally sure I follow. my form has a .change method. an input inside the form has a keyup method. the key up method triggers the .change method on the form. as I need it everytime a new character is entered. but when you leave the input box it triggers the forms .change again. which is annoying. I'd like the keyup to call trigger on the form but no longer trigger the form on change... if that makes sense
[15:48:10] <ajpiano> uptownben: yep
[15:48:36] <gnarf> brianpWins: form.find("input").change( function(e) { e.stopPropagation() });
[15:48:55] <gnarf> uptownben: so long as you are returning a function, it works... if you want to do it in a loop see ?each
[15:48:56] <bot-t> uptownben, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:49:29] <gnarf> .each( function() { $( this ).change( makeFunction( this ) ); }); for instance, although that just seems "silly" :)
[15:50:28] <ajpiano>  .each( function() { $( this ).change( $.proxy( makeFunction( this ) ), this).bind(this); });
[15:50:32] <ajpiano> BIND THE HELL OUT OF THIS
[15:51:10] <intellilogic> Reference:  <tr id='row_1'><td><input title='Delete' /></td><td><input size='20' name='db_value' type='text' value='1' /></td>...  $('#row_1 db_value').val()  returning undefined, what to do?
[15:51:52] <ajpiano> intellilogic $("#row1 input[name='db_value']").val()
[15:52:32] <intellilogic> Thank you ajpiano
[15:53:03] <ajpiano> welcome
[15:53:11] <intellilogic> What if I wanted to put a JS variable in there?
[15:53:35] <intellilogic> "#row"+Row_Num+" input...   that would work?
[15:54:22] <ajpiano> yup
[15:56:10] <intellilogic> ajpiano:  Awesome, thanks so much!
[15:58:49] <uptownben> So I tried adding a new function to the .change event of a <select> element, and I keep getting an " Uncaught TypeError: Object function(){console.log('func1');},function(){console.log('func2');} has no method 'each'   "
[15:59:00] <uptownben> when the event fires

[16:42:22] <SEJeff> You're flooding
[16:42:34] <SEJeff> very very bad irc etiquette
[16:42:35] <Vivid_> sorry jeff? i'm a newb, can you spell it out?
[16:42:42] <Vivid_> sorry
[16:42:49] <SEJeff> Vivid_, Put stuff like that in jsbin
[16:42:52] <gnarf> ?p
[16:42:53] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:42:54] <SEJeff> with a working example, don't paste it to irc
[16:42:55] <Vivid_> ahh ok
[16:43:07] <SEJeff> xoxo @gnarf
[16:45:01] <Vivid_> this code isn't working, any ideas? http://fixee.org/paste/ebksxl1/
[16:45:45] <Vivid_> it works if I take out the second (click) function
[16:46:16] <kvnn> Is there a way to make .delegate act like .live in regards to elements not yet in DOM?
[16:53:58] <wite> Vivid_: you're missing a } at the end of the two functions inside .ready()
[16:55:02] <wite> Vivid_: you're also missing the anonymous call that you're supposed to use in .ready
[16:57:18] <wite> Vivid_: also, you can't do two callbacks in .click() as far as I know.
[16:58:29] <Vivid_> wite: thanks
[16:58:58] <Vivid_> not sure about the anon call, can you explain?
[16:59:20] <wite> using function(){  … } without giving it a name is called an anonymous function
[16:59:51] <wite> Vivid_: just a sec, let me give you an example
[17:00:43] <z1000> when using .load with ajax... is there a way to make it always show the loader graphic for at least 3 seconds?
[17:03:33] <wite> Vivid_: http://dpaste.com/587614/ this is how that snippet would work. I dont' know if that really achieves all of the functionality you're going for, but that's how you'd correct that as far as syntax goes.
[17:04:31] <wite> Vivid_: you pass everything to $(document).ready() as a callback, which you generally define as an anonymous function, as i did in my paste.
[17:05:16] <ivan2> hi, it may look stupid but how can I detect the change of an input when that input is not focussed? (change() doesn't trigger in that situation)
[17:05:25] <Vivid_> the alert is firing now, thnk you, still have problems but i see what you did :o)
[17:05:53] <ivan2> I have to click that input and unfocus manually
[17:08:23] <tenable01> question about plugin OO patterns
[17:09:29] <tenable01> is it good to create an object in your $.fn function that caches all the dom elements and then return that obj so that it's available in your private functions (functions not inside the $.fn function)?
[17:09:48] <ivan2> doesn't work with keyup() either...
[17:11:47] <tenable01> is there a better way to do this? https://gist.github.com/1128813
[17:12:34] <tenable01> is that a good pattern?
[17:12:43] <seancurtis> ivan2: if the input isn't focused what is changing the contents?
[17:12:52] <ivan2> a slider
[17:13:38] <wite> ivan2: could you do it on the change event for the slider?
[17:13:42] <seancurtis> well after whatever script you have is modifying the contents of the input also get it to trigger a change (or other custom) event
[17:15:18] <ivan2> seancurtis, , wite : it uses a big javascript library, and is written in a  way that doesn't look like C at all
[17:15:40] <seancurtis> ivan2: what do you mean a slider
[17:15:59] <seancurtis> sliding images around or a little slider like a volume slider?
[17:16:17] <seancurtis> you'll need to trigger an event somehow
[17:16:29] <ivan2> the slider output it value in an input, the I want to get that value for display other data relevant to the input value
[17:16:35] <ivan2> volume
[17:16:54] <seancurtis> have you seen the html5 input type
[17:17:01] <seancurtis> what browsers are you supporting for it?
[17:17:06] <ivan2> I don't use a html5 doctype
[17:17:16] <seancurtis> which browsers?
[17:17:52] <ivan2> well, I have to look in that library I guess, even if it looks like sanskrit XD
[17:18:13] <seancurtis> just search for ".value" or .val() if it uses jquery
[17:18:29] <ivan2> seancurtis, type=range doesn't triger if I do't change the doctype so I guess other html5 features will not work
[17:18:51] <Engin> balls of the inventor of jquery needs to be kissed.
[17:19:01] <ivan2> or maybe with a setimeout check
[17:19:12] <seancurtis> ivan2 you could certainly poll
[17:19:32] <seancurtis> setInterval would work - but quite heavy - depends what you're doing I guess
[17:20:10] <ivan2> It is just an informative place, not very important, would do fine
[17:21:10] <ivan2> but yeah the inventor of javascript should maybe make those changes trigger on changes for real XD
[17:21:17] <Abbas-> guys, ye like my new avatar? http://i.imgur.com/69Jsn.jpg
[17:25:16] <ivan2> sweet, works
[17:25:47] <ClashCityKing> Starting a project; thinking of using jQuery to create a "m." version. But the project is HTML + CSS with a little AJAX to adjust some elements. I'm not sure I even need jQuery for that.
[17:28:38] <magcius> ClashCityKing, and?
[17:28:59] <magcius> If you don't think you need jQuery, don't use jQuery. Use the right tool for the job.
[17:31:49] <wookiehangover> when choose tools, I normally always go for the hammer that I've duct-taped a handgun to
[17:32:06] <wookiehangover> fixes just about everything
[17:34:25] <pilgrim> Is there a shortcut to get length of text() of .prevAll()/
[17:34:26] <pilgrim> ?
[17:34:32] <pilgrim> Does that even make sense?
[17:34:47] <kvnn> Is there a way to make .delegate act like .live in regards to elements not yet in DOM?
[17:35:02] <wookiehangover> kvnn: yes
[17:35:05] <wookiehangover> just use it normally
[17:35:37] <wookiehangover> "Description: Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements."
[17:35:48] <kvnn> wookiehangover : that does not happen for me
[17:35:56] <kvnn> the documentation made me ask the question
[17:36:04] <wookiehangover> are you sure you have a good selector
[17:36:16] <wookiehangover> that's literally the description of delegate
[17:36:24] <wookiehangover> its impossible for it to NOT work that way
[17:36:34] <wookiehangover> because it relies on bubbling
[17:36:49] <lostandconfused> I don't know what I'm missing here, but can anyone potentially take a peak at how I could extract just the map portion of a page like this? http://eaglecrestredmondoregon.idxco.com/idx/10243/mapSearch.php
[17:36:54] <lostandconfused> I'd be eternally grateful
[17:37:02] <lostandconfused> I feel like I'm missing something with a script or something
[17:37:23] <kvnn> wookiehangover : I think I understand whats going on. If I do $('.view-business-filtering').delegate, it won't work for a future .view-business-filtering element
[17:37:28] <wookiehangover> ?g google maps api @ lostandconfused
[17:37:29] <bot-t> lostandconfused, Google Maps API Family - Google Code - http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html
[17:37:31] <kvnn> I misunderstood "now or in the future"
[17:37:48] <wookiehangover> kvnn: delegate specifies that you apply it to a parent elem
[17:38:08] <lostandconfused> @wookiehangover I know how to register an api, I'm just curious as to how I could take that map and place it on a website -- IDX populates the map for me continually
[17:38:15] <wookiehangover> use live() if that's the syntax you want to use
[17:38:27] <lostandconfused> Perhaps it isn't possible
[17:38:40] <wookiehangover> well.... its possible if you use the api

[17:39:15] <wookiehangover> pilgrim: there's nothing shorter than $(blah).prevAll().text().length

[17:42:28] <ClashCityKing> magicus: I'm concerned about cross-browser compatibility and don't want to sniff the platform and display or code up that many sites
[17:42:39] <magcius> ClashCityKing, don't do that.
[17:43:07] <ClashCityKing> magcius: right. i know that much. and i can see jquery mobile does some of that for you
[17:43:08] <magcius> ClashCityKing, assuming you make a compliant site and you're not shipping on anything insane, you shouldn't need to sniff.
[17:43:16] <magcius> sure
[17:43:30] <wookiehangover> ClashCityKing: use jquery, if you're concerned about size, serve it from the google cdn with a fallback, like html5 boilerplate recommends
[17:43:45] <wookiehangover> that way you can benefit from potential caching
[17:43:55] <wookiehangover> never, ever browser sniff

[17:44:05] <bot-t> wookiehangover, Modernizr - http://modernizr.com/
[17:44:25] <ClashCityKing> does jQuery help with cross-browser compatibility for simple AJAX and HTML layout?
[17:44:53] <wookiehangover> x-browser ajax, yes
[17:45:00] <wookiehangover> html layout, no
[17:45:08] <wookiehangover> unless you use jquery mobile
[17:45:15] <wookiehangover> then, yes
[17:45:36] <ClashCityKing> sorry, i am using jquery mobile but i don't want to let it re-style things because they come out far too large for this specific site
[17:46:16] <wookiehangover> you can specify that it not style certain elements
[17:46:33] <ClashCityKing> and if you do does jqm still help with consistent layout cross platform?
[17:46:34] <wookiehangover> but in that case, its not of *too* much value, IMO
[17:46:42] <wookiehangover> yes
[17:47:23] <ClashCityKing> hmmm...cross browser support is a necessity so that might be enough value to justify it
[17:47:39] <ClashCityKing> wookiehangover: would that be your take?
[17:58:01] <bfred> how do I avoid animation pileup while using slideDown/Up? .stop().slideUp() will mess up the object's detected height
[17:58:37] <gnarf> bfred: there has been some work for 1.7 to help handle that
[17:58:40] <gnarf> but currently
[17:58:57] <gnarf> .stop( true, true ).slideToggle() is prolly the "best" you'll get
[17:59:27] <wookiehangover> or adding .not(':animated')
[18:00:41] <iateadonut> jquery uses id's and not name's to find elements, right?
[18:01:10] <wookiehangover> iateadonut: untrue
[18:01:20] <gnarf> iateadonut: it uses css selectors to find elements
[18:01:27] <gnarf> if you #whatever then its looking for an id
[18:01:34] <gnarf> if you [name='whatever'] then it looks for names
[18:01:39] <pavan_> can anyone help me with some css in IE?
[18:01:57] <pavan_> Also asking this in css, but I am always more succesful here :)
[18:02:16] <bfred> gnarf: nice solutions, probably wookiehangover's is best in my situation… you know… people double click links sometimes
[18:02:28] <iateadonut> gnarf, thanks.
[18:02:47] <wookiehangover> bfred: that's my favorite method for preventing "jerk-ass" clicking
[18:02:58] <bfred> there's no way to join .not(elem).not(':animated'), right?
[18:03:22] <wookiehangover> that should work
[18:03:33] <bfred> ;)
[18:03:37] <wookiehangover> not just removes anything it matches from the selector
[18:04:31] <bfred> I was hoping .not(elem,':animated') would work
[18:04:40] <bfred> not a big deal
[18:05:04] <wookiehangover> not also comes in psuedo-selector flavor
[18:05:11] <wookiehangover> ':not(whatever)'
[18:05:28] <wookiehangover> not sure if that helps tho
[18:17:20] <madprops> how can I make slimbox close when I click the image? http://dpaste.com/587660/  i've tried adding .click(close) and directly adding onClick="close()"  but it won't work :/
[18:21:23] <iateadonut> does it use much extra processing power to say $('#sendEmailButton').disabled=false; rather than just doing document.getElementById('sendEmailButton').disabled=false; ?
[18:22:05] <Light-> doubt it, since its an id selector jQuery would use document.getElementByID anyway
[18:22:26] <iateadonut> right, but it has to go through the code, or would it be cached already or what?
[18:22:59] <iateadonut> \me realizes that i should really peruse the jQuery code before asking such questions
[18:23:12] * iateadonut realizes that i should really peruse the jQuery code before asking such questions
[18:23:23] <Light-> I dont think jQuery caches selectors anymore, and im pretty sure your computer is fast enough that you wont notice the difference
[18:23:51] <Light-> you could try writing a benchmark?
[18:37:38] <ch3mical> Would someone please tell me why I can only send AJAX requests if I manually specify the URL as a string, and not a variable(string)?
[18:37:56] <snover> what the fuck is “variable(string)”?
[18:38:03] <dualcore> in what channel could i ask about a site to use for searching for files on megaupload? such as icefilms.info (which is down)
[18:38:05] <madprops> can I make an onclick use a the function of a specific js file?
[18:38:17] <ch3mical> snover: a variable that is a string, not an object/array/etc?
[18:38:20] <snover> dualcore: not any channel on freenode. take it elsewhere.
[18:38:21] <ch3mical> o_O
[18:38:42] <dualcore> okay sorry
[18:38:57] <snover> ch3mical: probably because the variable is wrong.
[18:39:21] <ch3mical> The variable is identical to the string, I got the string from the variable

[19:36:06] <Danny_Joris> Hi all
[19:36:28] <Danny_Joris> this works for me, but I don't really know what i%4 does: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6599247/eq-to-select-every-4th-class/6599865#6599865
[19:36:38] <Danny_Joris> that's probably basic JS
[19:36:51] <Danny_Joris> I know in the end it selects every 4th element
[19:37:06] <Danny_Joris> but is i%4 a mathematical operation?
[19:38:22] <kborchers> Danny_Joris: It's the modulus. It divides I by 4 then takes the remainder.
[19:39:01] <Danny_Joris> but isn't 4 devided by 4, 1 ?
[19:39:28] <kborchers> Yes with a remainder of 0
[19:39:38] <Danny_Joris> kborchers: ah !

[20:15:17] <Danny_Joris> wherever I have 0.25, or 0.50 , I want to have an integer that is 0 - without everything after the decimal.. http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/J9skd/41/
[20:15:24] <Danny_Joris> I want to create groups of 4...
[20:16:11] <Danny_Joris> I want to round it down. Is this possible with JS?
[20:19:21] <Light-> Danny_Joris, parseInt(0.25) and parseInt(0.50) returns 0 for me
[20:20:26] <snover> If only there was some sort of mathematical library that comes included with JavaScript to provide access to common mathematical functions like floor and round and ceil, but I guess not
[20:21:05] <Danny_Joris> Light-: yes, it looks like that works. thanks. Feels a bit like cheating though :)
[20:21:35] <Light-> Sometimes you have to cheat a little to get the job done :)
[20:22:58] <Light-> danieliser, I dont think so, it makes the initial page load smaller if you include them in your returned ajax instead of in one large javascript file
[20:23:12] <snover> Light-: um. no?
[20:23:38] <snover> I cannot believe you just suggested using parseInt with a straight face
[20:23:46] <snover> to round down
[20:23:51] <Danny_Joris> :)
[20:23:54] <Danny_Joris> suggestions?
[20:23:56] <Light-> is there a problem with it?
[20:24:03] <danieliser> Light: thanks.. thats what i figured..
[20:24:21] <danieliser> isnt there a flat() or something that converts integer to whole number?
[20:24:29] <snover> ?lmgtfy javascript round down @ Danny_Joris
[20:24:29] <bot-t> Danny_Joris, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+round+down
[20:24:31] <Light-> he wanted a way to truncate a decimal to its nearest hole number, by rounding down. parseInt does exactly that
[20:24:41] <Light-> whole*
[20:24:57] <danieliser> not neccesarily.. 1.9 rouns to 11 not 10
[20:25:08] <danieliser> 10.9 rather
[20:25:26] <Light-> >>> parseInt(10.9)
[20:25:27] <Light-> 10
[20:25:31] <Light-> it does?
[20:25:40] <danieliser> not sure.. can test though
[20:25:53] <Light-> I just did, thats output from firebug
[20:25:59] <Danny_Joris> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_parseint

[20:26:45] <Danny_Joris> I'm getting bigtime schooled here :)
[20:26:50] <bfred> I've been using .delay(1).queue(fn) to execute fn after the current function (for various and convenient reasons) and was wondering if there was a better (or quicker way) to do it. I was investigating postMessage as a faster alternative, but it's not chain able as .delay(1) http://dbaron.org/log/20100309-faster-timeouts
[20:27:08] <danieliser> always rounds down
[20:27:26] <Light-> sure does
[20:28:30] <danieliser> Math.round(parseFloat(this.value))
[20:28:34] <snover> It does not round. It converts the number to a string and then parses numbers from the string until it encounters a non-digit. Again, if only there were SOME MATH FUNCTION that did this and was built into JavaScript!
[20:28:42] <snover> oh for fuck’s sake.
[20:29:01] <danieliser> sorry.. not exactly sure what your end goal is
[20:29:48] <danieliser> lol.. nvm i get it.. sorry snover
[20:29:54] <Light-> snover, it achieves the desired result, so who cares?
[20:30:34] <snover> Light-: anyone that cares about performance, or maintainability
[20:30:54] <snover> you can use a hammer to put a screw in the wall
[20:30:57] <snover> does not make it the right tool for the job
[20:31:33] <snover> and if you were a carpenter and you tried to do that in my house I would fire you
[20:31:35] <snover> for incompetence
[20:32:08] <danieliser> actually they make these new nail screws.. hammer it in.. screw it out
[20:32:20] <danieliser> and i am a contractor

[20:35:43] <jaypitidi> Can I select multiple elements and ID's like this $('#mydiv img, #mydiv2 img).fadeOut()?
[20:35:59] <danieliser> yes
[20:36:19] <jaypitidi> thanks, figured it would be quicker to ask than to make changes and upload to my server
[20:54:59] <Danny_Joris> snover: looks like math.floor could do the trick?
[20:55:29] <bfred> how to un-.wrap()?
[20:56:20] <Danny_Joris> snover: also the slowest? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2526682/why-is-javascripts-math-floor-the-slowest-way-to-calculate-floor-in-javascript
[20:59:11] <Danny_Joris> gotta catch some sleep...
[20:59:13] <Danny_Joris> cheers
[20:59:19] <Danny_Joris> thanks for all the advice !
[21:04:24] <bfred> a better way to do $elem.width($elem.width()) ? (to fix its width)
[21:06:08] <bung> interesting, .addClass(false) will not add 'class="false"' however .attr('id',false) adds 'id="false"'
[21:06:13] <bung> anyone know why they might have done that?
[21:12:47] <bung> anyone have any insight on why jquery adds the id attribute in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/gvYXX/
[21:12:59] <bung> in my case would be nice if it didn't, but im guessing theres a reason
[21:14:21] <jaypitidi> I have an array with images. I'm using the Math() method to randomize it. It is used in an ajax script but the images only randomize on a page refresh, they do not randomize for each ajax call. How can I get it to be random for each ajax call?
[21:14:30] <jaypitidi> The images are different color preloaders btw
[21:14:33] <bung> i guess friday night isnt the best time around here :)
[21:15:05] <jaypitidi> the nerds are trying to act like they have something better to do
[21:15:13] <jaypitidi> they really dont
[21:16:18] <bung> hmm guess my problem has been resolved in svn http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/118
[21:17:14] <austen> bung: not sure why you're setting .attr("id",false);
[21:17:31] <jaypitidi> i was going to say the same
[21:17:56] <austen> .attr() gets or sets an attribute, so you're setting an ID to false. removeAttr("id") is what you want.
[21:18:07] <bung> i dont want to have to run a check on a var to see if its false before adding an attribute
[21:18:55] <bung> itd be nice if it just figured it out on its own
[21:18:59] <austen> Okay, however having an id=false is valid, which is what you're doing with your code.
[21:19:38] <bung> id="false" means i could do like $('#false').   ... the thing is I don't want an ID set if the ID var is false
[21:19:41] <bung> know what i mean?
[21:20:09] <bung> if(someIDAttrVar) $(something).attr('id',someIDAttrVar);
[21:20:13] <bung> dont want the if()
[21:21:04] <austen> So if var ID == false, you don't want <li> to have an ID attribute.
[21:21:14] <bung> precisly
[21:21:21] <bung> precisely?
[21:21:34] <bung> yes
[21:22:15] <coldhead> i think jQuery is behaving correctly therer
[21:22:22] <coldhead> attr gets or sets an attr
[21:22:47] <coldhead> and there shouldn't be a magic value which means "hey i know this looks like you're setting but i actually want the attr removed altogehter"
[21:22:52] <coldhead> that's not clean
[21:23:02] <austen> $('.someclass').attr("id");
[21:23:08] <austen> returns 'undefined'
[21:23:19] <coldhead> jaypitidi: you're very rude
[21:23:21] <bung> im not trying to remove an attr
[21:23:26] <bung> i'd use removeAttr for that
[21:23:44] <coldhead> jaypitidi: you probably want to call yur randomizer after each ajax call, in the success handler
[21:23:53] <austen> if .someclass doesn't have an id attribute. So test for that if you want to make sure it doesn't exist.
[21:23:57] <bung> austen, that would return something if .something had an id
[21:24:23] <bung> im not trying to test if the element has an existing id
[21:24:48] <bung> :)
[21:24:55] <bung> its all good, im gonna try the SVN and see if it works for me
[21:25:26] <austen> Ok, you're really confusing me. :) Instead of using .attr() use .removeAttr("id")
[21:25:44] <austen> That will ensure that $(elem) does not have an id attribute.
[21:26:17] <austen> The latter will work even if $(elem) doesn't have an id attribute already.
[21:26:20] <coldhead> he wants .attr('anything', false) to do nothing because false is false
[21:26:33] <bung> right :)
[21:26:48] <coldhead> i hope jquery never works like that
[21:26:55] <bung> im fairly certain it already does
[21:27:02] <bung> like i said, .addClass(false) does nothing
[21:27:10] <bung> which makes plenty of sense to me
[21:27:11] <coldhead> MAYBE .attr('anything', undefined) could leave the attr undefined
[21:27:15] <coldhead> but false is a thing
[21:27:32] <coldhead> false is not a class
[21:27:33] <bung> but unrelated to html ?
[21:28:01] <jaypitidi> coldhead: like this? $mainContent.load(newHash + " #guts", function() { function() {colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)]};?
[21:28:22] <coldhead> that looks okay to me, jaypitidi
[21:28:32] <jaypitidi> ok because that doesn't work lol
[21:28:52] <austen> I'm pretty sure .attr(false) doesn't do anything either...
[21:29:07] <coldhead> austen: but.attr('athing', false)...
[21:29:27] <austen> Ok, it produces a syntax error...
[21:29:55] <austen> Yeah, adds anything=false into the element.
[21:30:16] <bung> coldhead, i think ill just go with undefined for now since that works
[21:30:25] <bung> appreciated :)
[21:31:24] <austen> Ok.. :) I'm completely missing the big picture here. :)
[21:32:13] <bung> no worries bud, have a good night
[21:32:41] <coldhead> bung, austen: http://jsfiddle.net/Vyekb/
[21:33:05] <coldhead> null and undefined are indistinguishable from an attr that doesn't exist
[21:34:27] <bung> remind me again, if you call object.property that's not defined, you get undefined/null or false
[21:34:48] <austen> I guess I just fail to understand why you'd want to produce this behavior. If you don't want a statement to do anything isn't it simply better programming practice to not execute any statement at all?
[21:35:03] <coldhead> ?eval window.thingnotdefined
[21:35:03] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[21:35:11] <bung> cool
[21:35:48] <austen> I suppose there are circumstances for everything...
[21:36:01] <bung> austen, just goes back to seeing if its possible to remove the if() statement of this line: if(someIDAttrVar) $(something).attr('id',someIDAttrVar);
[21:36:44] <bung> and it is if im using undefined/null instead of false
[21:37:01] <bung> :)
[21:37:02] <Engin> anyway to scroll the whole page to a certain element much like foo.html#bar but without polluting the address bar at all ?
[21:37:15] <Engin> I mean, it is doable with scroll but, any off the head quick tip

[21:38:12] <austen> bung: ok. )
[21:38:43] <bung> if you don't need a plugin ... ;)
[21:39:06] <Engin> let me see, I'drather use a snippet instead of full blown plugin
[21:39:07] <austen> Although I think the if statement makes it clearer what your code is doing.
[21:40:06] <coldhead> i agree, austen
[21:40:19] <coldhead> without the if() you have to know how attr works in special cases
[21:40:24] <rhino_> I'm trying to use jquery/agax .get to create a live search to update the results on my page.  I am able to pass the search terms/letters to the proper action in  the controller, however, It will not run the new query or update the page.  Here is my code:  https://gist.github.com/1129017  Any help would be greatly appreciated
[21:40:24] <coldhead> to be able to understand the code
[21:41:37] <eago> hi, I', starting with juqery and I have a first question: I tried using th name of a function as callback function and it didn't seem to work. do I always have t use annonymous functions for events?
[21:42:32] <bung> when i look at .attr(attr,value), if value is undefined i expect nothing to happen
[21:42:43] <bung> i dont think its a special case, i think its basic
[21:42:52] <bung> maybe its just me
[21:43:16] <coldhead> and if value is false?
[21:43:19] <coldhead> or null?
[21:43:22] <coldhead> or {} ?
[21:43:29] <coldhead> or [null] ?
[21:43:37] <bung> so if() returns false in all those cases?
[21:44:33] <coldhead> i donno!
[21:44:58] <bung> ?eval if({})
[21:44:59] <bot-t> bung: SyntaxError: syntax error
[21:45:08] <bung> hehe
[21:45:11] <bung> not quite
[21:45:22] <bung> ok lemme jsfiddle it and see
[21:48:42] <bung> guess not, http://jsfiddle.net/9vr4e/
[21:48:59] <bung> do you honestly run checks for all those things everytime?
[21:49:05] <bung> create a function for it?
[22:00:10] <coldhead> bung: i might create a test case or i might read the source, or i usually just assume jQuery does what i want
[22:00:20] <coldhead> but falsy values are tricky in javascript
[22:00:29] <coldhead> so it's worth experimenting
[22:12:51] <bung> coldhear, i hear that
[22:12:57] <bung> heh, coldhead even
[22:19:44] <coldhead> wha? http://www.itproportal.com/2011/08/04/five-things-know-about-html5/
[22:37:41] <snover> ?eval undefined > -1
[22:37:42] <bot-t> snover: false
[22:38:52] <ckb> Say I have 2 delegations on a single element (one for generic, and one for specific purposes), do both these delegations trigger? and if so, is there a way to prevent the generic delegation from triggering?
[22:39:19] <bung> whats up with that article coldhead ?
[22:39:45] <ckb> might I add, specifity on the generic element would not even be as broad as the specificity of the specific element
[22:40:59] <ckb> uhhh, I meant the complete opposite of what I just said.
[22:44:36] <da-beginner> hi all.. need some pointers on third party softwares that does image uploading and editing for publishing websites such as personalised business cards and posters
[22:46:06] <jaypitidi> how come whenever I try to use the easing property for jquery it never works?
[22:48:45] <ckb> have you tried $.animate({}, { duration: 100, easing: 'swing' });?
[22:50:21] <jaypitidi> no
[22:53:50] <da-beginner> i'm looking for a third party app for business card editor or sort.. any pointers?
[22:55:14] <bricker> What do you guys recommend for making sure a form is not submitted twice? I can hit the "Enter" key quickly twice in a row and it submits the form twice.
[22:55:45] <wite> bricker: on submit, disable the submit button
[22:56:19] <bricker> wite: but the form is being submitted by pressing the enter key
[22:56:48] <bricker> The form will still submit with the "enter" key if the submit button is disabled, right? in most browsers, anyways
[22:56:52] <wkmanire> Howdy folks!
[22:56:55] <wkmanire> been a while.
[22:57:00] <wite> bricker:
[22:57:01] <wite> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[22:57:19] <ckb> bricker: var submitted = false; $(formelem).submit(function() { if (submitted) return false; submitted = true; ... }
[22:57:22] <da-beginner> bricker: then disable the enter key
[22:58:30] <ckb> I really need to figure out a way to undelegate this click even, I don't want two XHR executing
[23:00:18] <wkmanire> ckb: Is $.undelegate not working for you?
[23:00:52] <coldhead> hi wkmanire
[23:01:01] <wkmanire> coldhead: Hey coldhead. How ya been?
[23:01:29] <coldhead> cool to mild, wkmanire. how's yourself?
[23:01:35] <wkmanire> I'm alive.
[23:01:54] <wkmanire> Finished up my divorce, changed my work schedule 3 times and helped my son survive a few more months of being a toddler.
[23:02:21] <ckb> wkmanire: Here's the thing..
[23:02:43] <ckb> wkmanire: $("body").delegate("a", 'click', foo);
[23:03:07] <wkmanire> thing noted.
[23:03:09] <ckb> $("body").undelegate('a.class', 'click');
[23:03:11] <ckb> ?
[23:03:19] <ckb> Or another alternative..
[23:03:30] <wkmanire> You want to undelegate using a more specific selector.
[23:03:31] <wkmanire> I see.
[23:03:58] <wkmanire> I'm not sure if the selector is stored like that. I wonder if it is just a map internally.
[23:04:03] <jaypitidi> ckb, i'm using a scrollTo animation plugin and I've called the function $scrollTo(blahblahblah).animate({}, { duration: 100, easing: 'swing' }); and that still doesn't work
[23:04:41] <wkmanire> You know something like {"a": doThis} such that "a.class" wouldn't match a key in the set.
[23:04:42] <ckb> jaypitidi: you obviously have to specify properties to animate :)
[23:05:10] <ckb> ya, wkmanire that's why I can't do it :)
[23:05:14] <wkmanire> ckb: I'm just pondering out loud.
[23:05:15] <wkmanire> he he
[23:05:17] <jaypitidi> in the first braces....
[23:05:18] <jaypitidi> silly me
[23:05:54] <wkmanire> ckb: Have you considered using :not and just using two delegates?
[23:06:04] <ckb> Ideally, what I wanted to do, was be able to specify elements to replace in the current DOM from XHR requests..
[23:06:36] <ckb> so a more specific selector, obiously would be replacing fewer elements, less work on the browser.
[23:07:25] <ckb> where the generic delegation would default to replacing practically the entire dom (or maybe just the items I'd replace anyways)
[23:08:10] <ckb> Eventually, down the line, I'll be able to just respond with smaller groups of DOM elements, and make my HTTP responses tiny :)
[23:08:28] <rhino_> what is a good load time for a ror site?
[23:09:25] <ckb> blah!
[23:10:27] <wkmanire> ckb: Can you be more specific about what you're building?
[23:10:45] <ckb> no sir :(
[23:10:54] <wkmanire> Setting up a delegate on a selector like "a" to do anything sound inefficient.
[23:10:58] <dexter_e> Anyone know if icanHazJs is compatible with jQuery 1.6.1
[23:10:58] <dexter_e> ?
[23:11:04] <wkmanire> sounds*
[23:12:33] <ckb> wkmanire: a single HTTP text/html response from my server is 17KB. a single application/json response (same page, content, etc) is bout 7.1KB (returned will just <div id="x"></div>) instead of in-depth headers, etc
[23:13:04] <wkmanire> You must be working on a very high volume site for 10 kb to matter.
[23:13:21] <bricker> ckb: it seems that if I disable the inputs right after the form is submitted, they don't get sent in the request, as if they were blank
[23:13:36] <snover> and/or need to learn to use mod_deflate
[23:13:36] <ckb> bricker: why would you disable the inputs?
[23:14:10] <ckb> snover: development, right now.
[23:14:25] <bricker> ckb: because I don't want the enter key to submit the form twice, so if they can't type in "enter" then that won't happen
[23:14:56] <wkmanire> bricker: I think someone already pasted a snippet that would prevent that for you right?
[23:15:08] <ckb> the enter key AND clicking the submit button both trigger the 'submit' event on the form.
[23:15:14] <da-beginner> any pointer on online business card editor? where can i find those?
[23:15:22] <wkmanire> bricker: Remember where they brought a flag into the function that handles the submit via its closure which is set the first time the form submits through that function?
[23:15:34] <ckb> so thus.. .submit(function() { return false; }); would prevent it from submitting again
[23:16:39] <ckb> snover: no input? just sarcasm on efficiency outside of compression?
[23:18:17] <coldhead> snovesy is beyond reproach, ckb
[23:18:17] <wkmanire> ckb: I'm trying to figure out what you're getting at. You are binding the click event for anchors that retrieves the page content via an XHR request and then replaces the DOM in the current page?
[23:18:35] <ckb> yeah, practically.
[23:18:38] <wkmanire> ckb: Is this so you can achieve some navigation transitions?
[23:18:56] <ckb> maybe, yes. but right now just replacement :)
[23:19:03] <ckb> and ajaxy loading
[23:19:49] <wkmanire> I'm trying to remember which talk it was, but I saw a technique like this being applied at the jQuery conference a few months ago.
[23:20:17] <wkmanire> Not that where I heard it matters that much, just that I think this technique has been explored by some other folks.
[23:20:35] <wkmanire> You might be able to find some good code/ideas that way.
[23:20:41] <wkmanire> I think it was for jQuery mobile.
[23:20:51] <ckb> more than likely, yes
[23:21:12] <ckb> mobile carrier moan about their bandwidth
[23:21:23] <wkmanire> Bah, its their own fault.
[23:21:50] <ckb> but hey, save money where you can right? :)
[23:21:53] <wkmanire> Don't sell the 350 engine when their is a gas shortage.
[23:21:57] <wkmanire> there*
[23:22:33] <dexter_e> ICanHazJS anyone ?
[23:22:54] <dexter_e> I wonder if there is a compat issue with jQuery 1.6.1
[23:23:06] <ckb> have you googled it?
[23:23:15] <ckb> or have you asked the authors?
[23:26:28] <coldhead> got a link, dexter_e ?
[23:26:45] <bricker> ckb: http://pastie.org/2328842 same results. This is an ajax request, if that changes anything
[23:26:50] <coldhead> it's more likely someone can say "ooh i bet it's X" if they see it, even if they don't know the lib
[23:27:31] <bricker> ckb: there are several forms on one page, each wrapped in a div with class ".new_song_form"
[23:27:57] <wkmanire> bricker: return false may not stop the form submitting but event.preventDefault() should.
[23:28:23] <ckb> #1
[23:28:32] <ckb> take out the var in the callback
[23:28:41] <wkmanire> oh yeah
[23:28:41] <wkmanire> that too
[23:28:42] <wkmanire> he he he
[23:28:53] <ckb> ugh
[23:29:06] <bricker> is "var" only for defining new variables?
[23:29:06] <wkmanire> My brain didn't want to see that var in there.
[23:29:59] <ckb> yes, bricker
[23:30:21] <coldhead> declaring
[23:30:34] <ckb> bricker, you should read about "variable and function scoping", before continuing developing. You'll find it helps a LOT.
[23:30:44] * wkmanire snortled.
[23:31:47] <austen> bricker: technically var is only for declaring global variables. regardless of the scope you declare them in.
[23:32:15] <bricker> I will do that, thank you
[23:32:17] <austen> And for making Internet Explorer do very basic things in already-global space.
[23:32:21] <bricker> http://pastie.org/2328842 producing same results
[23:32:49] <ckb> you left out return false; this time.
[23:32:59] <ckb> both for safe measure
[23:33:35] <ckb> are you adding this into $(doument).ready(function() { });?
[23:34:06] <bricker> ckb: I see, I thought I was replacing that with preventDefault
[23:34:09] <bricker> ckb: yes
[23:34:19] <bricker> adding return false under preventDefault seems to have worked
[23:34:27] <bricker> I wonder why that is
[23:34:32] <ckb> IE sucks
[23:34:34] <ckb> :)
[23:34:56] <bricker> ckb: I am aware, why would that affect me, though?
[23:35:31] * ckb shrugs.
[23:35:40] <bricker> thanks for the help!
[23:36:37] <wkmanire> Situations like this remind me of what papa Crockford said. “Javascript is the only language people use without first learning the language.”
[23:36:41] <wkmanire> The thing is, I think he's wrong.
[23:36:59] <coldhead> ?eval function foo() { var bricker = 'global scope, rly?'; }; bricker
[23:36:59] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: bricker is not defined
[23:37:11] <coldhead> ?eval function foo() { var bricker = 'global scope, rly?'; }; foo(); bricker
[23:37:11] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: bricker is not defined
[23:37:16] <wkmanire> I think people were jacking around with LISP to try to configure emacs a long time before they were c programming their way through javascript.
[23:37:17] <coldhead> >: \
[23:37:27] <bricker> wkmanire: I disagree… I wrote an entire CMS in Rails before I learned it
[23:37:41] <coldhead> Crockford is batshit crazy
[23:37:52] <coldhead> also remember when he used to be a massive fatty? lol
[23:37:52] <wkmanire> ha ha ha ha
[23:38:21] <wkmanire> bricker: Can I see it? :D
[23:38:28] <bricker> thebirn.com
[23:38:38] <bricker> well, there's an entire backend that you can't see
[23:38:53] <bricker> for dj's and management
[23:39:26] <wkmanire> Well the front end looks pretty cool.
[23:39:37] <ckb> coldhead: you have any idea how to achieve what I need to?
[23:39:43] <bricker> thank you :)
[23:41:05] <wkmanire> bricker: Just out of curiosity, why did you stick the date in the menu bar?
[23:41:13] <bricker> wkmanire: the problem is that, because I didn't know rails when I wrote this app, it is very poorly written and unstable. So I am currently re-writing it now that I am more familiar with the language.
[23:41:51] <bricker> wkmanire: *shrug*
[23:41:54] <bricker> :)
[23:42:11] <bricker> seemed like a logical thing to do
[23:42:13] <wkmanire> bricker: Yeah, when you have write under pressure like that its tough. Best thing you can do is take 3 days and read a book and then find some open source project that has a good reputation and read through it.
[23:42:18] <ckb> gee, sounds familiar...
[23:42:41] <bricker> wkmanire: I agree
[23:42:57] <wkmanire> You'll end up with a lot better code and probably finish sooner too.
[23:43:18] <wkmanire> Instead of alternating between 10 lines of code and google searches.
[23:43:19] <wkmanire> he he he
[23:43:20] <coldhead> i don't know delegate sorry ckb
[23:43:27] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:43:35] <wkmanire> coldhead: How many first days have you had now?
[23:43:35] <ckb> oh hell
[23:43:45] <ckb> wait a second..
[23:43:50] <coldhead> just the one, wkmanire
[23:43:54] <coldhead> one long day
[23:43:56] <wkmanire> ah, sure.
[23:43:57] <bricker> wkmanire: luckily I am not relying very heavily on jquery for the re-write… just a few small things here and there
[23:44:05] <ckb> coldhead: are you pulling a sweater over my head?
[23:45:02] <coldhead> not that i know of!
[23:45:18] <coldhead> that would be very rude of me
[23:45:41] <coldhead> i am wearing a sweater and listening to jazz arrangements of bartok and playing with jruby
[23:45:50] <ckb> blah
[23:45:57] <ckb> this is bugging me
[23:46:00] <wkmanire> bricker: Any time I use the word "re-write" my boss has a full body twitch. I tend to use the words "refactor" and "reorganize" these days.
[23:46:43] <ckb> wkmanire: my old boss deleted a database of mine, so I have to rewrite my entire project into drupal.
[23:46:59] <ckb> It was from scratch, but now it's ontop of drupal
[23:47:00] <bricker> wkmanire: those words were definitely thrown around as well
[23:47:04] <ckb> and a lot more efficient, I'd say
[23:47:14] <bricker> but there is no question about it, I am re-writing the whole damn thing
[23:47:20] <bricker> line by line
[23:47:27] <wkmanire> ckb: What all have you tried?
[23:47:51] <ckb> I've come down to 2 solutions
[23:47:59] <ckb> delegating a.ajax
[23:48:27] <ckb> for generic purposes. and a.spec-class for specific :\
[23:48:41] <wkmanire> Thats more or less what I was thinking.
[23:49:06] <ckb> but it's going to be a pain going through and changing all the anchor tags
[23:49:25] <ckb> and then, I would atleast have normal anchor clicks to rely on, if JS goes bad
[23:50:55] <wkmanire> ckb: Just out of curiosity, are you using backbone for this?
[23:51:07] <ckb> nope
[23:51:13] <wkmanire> It does some pretty cool stuff with the hash tag event in its controllers.
[23:51:35] <bricker> wkmanire: so event.preventDefault did what I wanted it to do, but it also applied it to all the other forms on the page, which makes sense. Where in the code would I stick a $(this) to only apply it only to the form that was submitted?
[23:52:26] <ckb> ohhhh
[23:52:44] <wkmanire> bricker: I don't understand.
[23:52:44] <ckb> you have to reset it back to false
[23:53:13] <ckb> yeah wait a second..
[23:53:16] <wkmanire> How is the form submitting and that variable staying true?
[23:53:23] <wkmanire> The page reloads and the state will reset.
[23:53:24] <ckb> ajax
[23:54:19] <wkmanire> Does the submit event fire for XHR with POST?
[23:54:48] <ckb> $.post() just opens a HTTP POST request
[23:54:52] <ckb> XHR..
[23:55:24] <bricker> wkmanire: The page is not being reloaded, this is using ajax
[23:55:29] <rhino_> what is the best way to setfocus to an input onload?
[23:55:55] <ckb> $(document).ready(function() { $(inputeleme).focus(); });
[23:57:06] <ohaibbq> $(function() { $(inputeleme).focus(); });
[23:57:08] <ohaibbq> code golf
[23:57:38] <rhino_> ckb:  how can I have it setfocus, but not highlight the text that aleady exists in the input?
[23:57:51] <wkmanire> Doesn't the submit event only fire when the client has been made to submit the form via button click or a key event? I'm looking at his pastebin and I don't see any XHR requests.
[23:58:01] <bricker> wkmanire: There are several forms on the page, and I'd like the preventDefault for the 'submit' event to only apply to the form that was submitted, but currently it is applying it to all the forms on the page, which is expected (because they are all ('.new_song_form form') ) . The ID of the form is dynamically created so there's really no way for me to use that
[23:58:10] <wkmanire> bah, that is redundant. XmlHttpRequest Requests.
[23:58:39] <wkmanire> bricker: Can you paste the ID?
[23:59:18] <ckb> bricker: you have to set submitted back to false.
[23:59:26] <ckb> come on now
[23:59:56] <ckb> or do this..
