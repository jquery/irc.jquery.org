[00:05:23] <Cork> g33kyboi: you using an older version of jquery that had a bug where $() couldn't parse html with space/tabs at the beginning of the stream
[00:07:17] <g33kyboi> getting a newer version of jquery will do, right?
[00:07:31] <Cork> i think so ya
[00:08:02] <Cork> g33kyboi: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13223
[00:08:08] <Cork> fixed from 1.10+
[00:20:33] <g33kyboi> Cork: corrected that. thanks
[00:34:13] <mazzachre> Can <select multiple> not be cloned with values?
[00:41:26] <Cork> mazzachre: it can
[00:42:33] <mazzachre> Cork: I am trying currently, and I don't get the selected items cloned...
[00:43:05] <Cork> mazzachre: ah, ya, i don't think the state will be kept
[00:43:18] <Cork> haven't tested that though
[00:43:42] <mazzachre> Cork: It won't... I have just tested it...
[01:04:24] <fn> http://pastie.org/private/h41exgl8bqsxiq72wtkkbw <<< could anyone finde some mistakes/issues at my script?
[01:06:38] <Cork> fn: should there be?
[01:07:02] <seutje> I like the localized variable names and the hosing of the global scope
[01:07:21] <seutje> like i is just like... out there
[01:07:27] <fn> Cork: i hope no - but i'm not sure about it, because the google pushes are ... mh... "crazy" :S
[01:08:49] <seutje> bodyScrollPos, viewW, unterkante and i seem to leak
[01:09:14] <fn> seutje: what's wrong? :O
[01:09:35] <Cork> undefined variables
[01:09:58] <fn> but that shouldn't be a problem, or is it one?
[01:10:01] <seutje> they are available everywhere on the page and are bound to cause problems somewhere else
[01:10:07] <Cork> fn: it is
[01:10:29] <Cork> fn: if nothing else it slows down the script
[01:10:45] <seutje> they have to be kept in memory even when they aren't needed anymore
[01:10:47] <Cork> fn: and if some other function fiddles with them you script might blow up
[01:10:52] <seutje> damnit cork, always a couple chars faster
[01:11:00] <fn> he, okey.
[01:11:07] <seutje> "i" is especially dangerous to leak
[01:11:11] <Cork> seutje: nope, didn't say the same as you did
[01:11:20] <fn> the "bugfix" will be to add "var varname;"
[01:11:33] <seutje> and perhaps an IIFE/closure
[01:11:37] <fn> "i" is only to count inside the while
[01:11:45] <fn> okey, but it will work
[01:11:56] <fn> may i post the hole problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18587064/push-element-pos-with-javascript-to-google-analytics
[01:12:00] <seutje> right now it's just floating out there and remain at its highest value
[01:12:20] <fn> seutje: so it should be by definition of co-workers...
[01:12:22] <Cork> fn: you are using a timer so you are escaping it by the skin of your teeth; but NEVER use alert in a scroll or resize event
[01:12:53] <seutje> console.log & friends for all your debugging needs
[01:12:58] <Cork> ya
[01:13:03] <fn> Cork: yeah ):
[01:13:04] <Cork> and no risk of locking the browser
[01:13:26] <Cork> focus is another scary event to use alert in
[01:13:53] <seutje> alert is just scary
[01:13:58] * Cork nods
[01:13:59] <seutje> the name itself
[01:14:05] <Cork> :D
[01:14:14] <seutje> window.alert('ACHTUNG!')
[01:14:19] <Cork> alert is fine as long as it is used for what it was intended for
[01:14:28] <Cork> witch doesn't include debugging :)
[01:14:34] <seutje> good luck convincing a client it isn't ugly as butt
[01:14:48] <seutje> that analogy sucked
[01:14:52] <seutje> I apologise
[01:15:18] <Cork> seutje: firefox has made there alert content html, i SO wish they actually let the site style it :)
[01:15:32] <Cork> that would have been neet
[01:15:59] <fn> Cork: change the alert to console.log
[01:16:08] <fn> not much time that i used that :D
[01:16:33] <seutje> I've hijacked it with a custom modal window, but it feels kinda wrong
[01:16:45] <Cork> seutje: ya, same here
[01:16:54] <Cork> (done it i mean)
[01:17:16] <seutje> you have no morals!
[01:17:39] <Cork> i don't see the problem with replacing it
[01:17:52] <Cork> it is a nice way forcing other to not use it :)
[01:18:24] <fn> is there an equivalent function to phps in_array() ?
[01:18:32] <Cork> $.inArray()
[01:18:52] <seutje> iono, I feel like alert has its own place to scare users
[01:19:10] <fn> thanks Cork
[01:19:22] <seutje> but yeah if some 3rd party script is calling it, I'm blowing it out of the water
[01:19:58] <Cork> seutje: though it has one feature that only it and confirm has
[01:20:08] <seutje> locking everything?
[01:20:10] <Cork> the possitility to frees the js stack
[01:20:26] <Cork> and wait for the browser to do something before js starts up again
[01:20:38] <seutje> yeah, but in an evented system, the need for that is rather limited imo
[01:21:03] <Cork> seutje: well i would have been interesting if js has a doEvent() call
[01:21:17] <Cork> that would have simplified code a lot
[01:21:19] <seutje> to fake native events?
[01:21:47] <Cork> while(;;) { elm.style.top += 10; doEvent(); }
[01:21:55] <fn> Cork: would like to disable the function when "7" is in the array, but... i'm retarded -.-
[01:21:55] <Cork> animatied!
[01:21:57] <Cork> :)
[01:22:05] <fn> if($.inArray('7',pushedSlides)==-1) { DOIT; }
[01:22:22] <Cork> fn: invert the arguments
[01:22:44] <fn> +1?
[01:22:47] <Cork> hmm wait no
[01:22:59] <Cork> fn: that should work
[01:23:05] <Cork> as long as the value in the array in a string
[01:23:24] <seutje> Cork: oh, u mean like "stop JS and do ur thing for a second"?
[01:23:41] <Cork> seutje: let the browser spin the event queue
[01:23:50] <Cork> and no not for a second
[01:24:00] <seutje> no not literally
[01:24:02] <Cork> for one spin, not a defined time
[01:24:06] <seutje> yeah
[01:24:27] <Cork> though that would risk dead locking the browser so they don't have that
[01:24:45] <seutje> isn't that sorta what requestAnimationFrame does, but without the callback mess?
[01:24:50] <Cork> but you can always dream :)
[01:24:58] <Cork> seutje: no
[01:25:02] <seutje> not when ur dead though
[01:25:10] <Cork> seutje: requestAnimationFrame is still callback based
[01:25:19] <seutje> yeah, that's what I meant
[01:25:20] <Cork> just like setTimeout
[01:25:26] <Cork> so it doens'
[01:25:37] <seutje> doEvent would remove the need for it
[01:25:37] <Cork> *'t allow you to do nifty things
[01:25:44] <McWeber_> hello
[01:26:05] <seutje> more like a "run the queue and come back *HERE*"
[01:26:09] <Cork> seutje: in extension it would allow returning values from an ajax call
[01:26:19] <McWeber_> could anyone reccommend me any good book/tutorial on php-ajax-jquery-json, pls?
[01:26:35] <Cork> McWeber_: not sure why you would need one
[01:26:41] <seutje> I need to read more books
[01:26:54] <Cork> McWeber_: it is only about 4 steps
[01:26:56] <McWeber_> I'm developing mobile apps with phonegap and I need to send/receive data from the server
[01:27:22] <Cork> McWeber_: set the correct mimecode in php, and do encode_json
[01:27:29] <Cork> McWeber_: return it and your done
[01:27:37] <Cork> return == echo
[01:27:50] <McWeber_> echo json_encode('data');
[01:27:55] <McWeber_> isn´t it?
[01:28:00] <Cork> opps yes
[01:28:06] <Cork> reverted the name :x
[01:28:13] <Cork> don't use php that much anymore
[01:28:23] <McWeber_> why?
[01:28:37] <Cork> i use go and ruby for my server needs
[01:28:58] <McWeber_> I was thinking of using rails....
[01:29:13] <Cork> McWeber_: just a warning rails is resource heavy
[01:29:13] <null__> use scala
[01:29:17] <McWeber_> but I have absolutely no idea/experience in server programming
[01:29:38] <McWeber_> and i thought that php was the best choice
[01:29:52] <null__> it's the easiest choice
[01:30:02] <Cork> McWeber_: if you run on web site hosting; yes without a question
[01:30:40] <Cork> if you run on your own server/vps then no there are lots of better options
[01:30:59] <McWeber_> my 1st idea was to use djando-python.... but it was a bit hard for a complete noob....
[01:32:19] <McWeber_> obviously at first I'll use a website hosting (although I won't have a web page, only server backend for mobile apps)
[01:32:29] <McWeber_> but then... we'll se
[01:54:42] <xqo> in my webshop, when you add something to cart, a little window shows up with your cart-contents, that is displayed on the right. I want to make the window show up center-screen, then slide over to its real position on the right.
[01:54:49] <xqo> is that a job for css or jquery animation?
[01:55:09] <Cork> xqo: either
[01:55:25] <Cork> xqo: though if you don't see it as essential i would go with css
[01:55:47] <Cork> transform+transition would make that fairly simple
[01:59:00] <xqo> Cork okej
[02:01:01] <xqo> Cork can I move it somewhere without making it position:fixed, and trying to estimate its location? I really want it inside a div, and just have some margins,
[02:01:13] <xqo> but the only way ive been able to work out the animation is this http://hastebin.com/reyuxofaxi.sm
[02:01:41] <xqo> #webshop_navigation_portlet is the base div. the first time it is loaded, it has the .webshop_animated_navigation_portlet class, which animates it
[02:02:07] <Cork> xqo: have a look at css3 transform
[02:02:32] <Cork> xqo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[02:03:08] <xec> what part needs transform?
[02:03:34] <Cork> he wants to have the cart animate from center to the place it should have
[02:04:37] <xec> the code he pasted seems to work fine? http://jsfiddle.net/xh5xB/
[02:04:51] <airdem> hi. how do i press a key via jquery?
[02:05:00] <airdem> like "arrow down"
[02:05:18] <xqo> xec but it doesnt position correctly
[02:05:32] <xqo> i want it to just have the position of #webshop_navigation_portlet,
[02:05:52] <xqo> but i cant do it right, so i have to make it position:fixed, and try to guess the locatiopn with top: and left:
[02:06:11] <xqo> like i want the end of animation to be the location of #webshop_navigation_portlet
[02:06:45] <xec> xqo: i'm not sure what that means in this case, as it's full width? http://jsfiddle.net/xh5xB/1/
[02:07:16] <xqo> well its full width of a sidebar really,
[02:07:26] <xqo> so its not really that wide, just as wide as the sidebar container
[02:08:48] <xqo> can i whisper you? ill show you the page if u want
[02:09:02] <xec> sure
[02:20:35] <biscuit> greetings. I'm noting an interesting behavior with this site I'm working on (*at least on chrome) and according to the inspetor built into chrome, the html tag stops before the end of the page (eg, theres a persistant bit of blank following the end of the page). As the content of the page changes size, the amount of blank after the html tag will be the same size as the largest amount of content in that session
[02:20:57] <biscuit> err
[02:21:12] <Cork> xqo: is this somewhat what your looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/xh5xB/4/
[02:21:41] <sharpy35> hey guys, i am having a question. I know that with the HTML 5 File Api i can check out the file name and file size before i am uploading them to my server. but i need to display the fileSize and fileName also in IE7-IE9 which doesnt support the html5 File API. Does anybody can support me with ideas or any workaround for this major problem?
[02:21:42] <Cork> opps forgot the prefixes
[02:22:17] <Cork> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/xh5xB/5/
[02:24:38] <sharpy35> the thing is, that i do not want to use Flash to do the upload or a java applet
[02:25:02] <sharpy35> ive been searching for some ajax solutions
[02:25:07] <xqo> Cork maybe, thanks ill try it out
[02:25:42] <Cork> sharpy35: you would have to depend on the file api, and older browsers doens't have that
[02:25:57] <Cork> sharpy35: but if that is ok, then sure you can do it with ajax
[02:26:33] <sharpy35> cork: how is it possible with ajax? thats the thing, its not ok that its not shown in ie7-9 :) i need to support them :)
[02:27:49] <sharpy35> i ve been think some solution like: having a form which allows multiple file input and then with the input files element change event i want to do an ajax request to figure out fileName and fileSize
[02:28:09] <Cork> sharpy35: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications
[02:28:36] <Cork> sharpy35: ajax doesn't support it directly, you need to convert the file input field to the raw file data
[02:28:55] <sharpy35> Cork: the link you posted uses the HTML 5 File Api
[02:29:24] <sharpy35> which i am only using for modern browsers but i also want to implement a fallback
[02:29:27] <Cork> sharpy35: eh, it uses the file api like i said (html5 isn't needed there)
[02:29:35] <Cork> sharpy35: i said that already
[02:29:52] <sharpy35> read the first sentence on the page
[02:29:52] <Cork> sharpy35: if it isn't in a modern browser ajax is out of the picture
[02:30:01] <sharpy35> cork: Using the File API, which was added to the DOM in HTML5
[02:30:35] <Cork> ugg so the marketing term is making it's way in there too...
[02:30:35] <sharpy35> cork: though it determines the File Api is an HTML 5 Feature
[02:30:43] <Cork> sharpy35: no it's not
[02:31:01] <Cork> sharpy35: the point is html5 is not something that means anything
[02:31:22] <Cork> it is just marketing and includes more or less everything you can do on the web defined in the last ~5 years
[02:31:35] <Cork> html+css+js+hw acceleration+ what ever
[02:31:46] <Cork> so it doesn't mean anything
[02:31:53] <sharpy35> ah ok, but the thing is that this api doesnt work for ie7 - 0
[02:31:55] <sharpy35> -9
[02:31:59] <Cork> yes
[02:32:10] <Cork> if you need older browser your only option is plugins
[02:32:11] <sharpy35> it only works in Browsers implementing the FileReader Objekt
[02:32:20] <Cork> flash, java or iframe + standard forms
[02:32:40] <Cork> jqupload is one option for that
[02:32:40] <sharpy35> flash & java are out of the range
[02:32:51] <sharpy35> how about iframe transport?
[02:32:53] <biscuit> I'm noting an interesting behavior with this site I'm working on (*at least on chrome) and according to the inspetor built into chrome,      alexwhitman
[02:32:56] <biscuit>           the html tag stops before the end of the page (eg, theres a persistant bit of blank following the end of the page). As the content of the page changes size, the amount   altf2o
[02:33:02] <biscuit> dangit
[02:33:19] <Cork> sharpy35: it is hacky as hell, but yes you can do file uploads thorough iframes
[02:34:01] <sharpy35> because the thing is
[02:34:13] <sharpy35> i first need to display filename and size before upload in every browser
[02:34:16] <montyjanderson> hello
[02:34:35] <sharpy35> and then print a realtime upload progress for the whole amount of files in every browser
[02:34:40] <Cork> sharpy35: show file size before upload excludes iframe
[02:34:53] <sharpy35> ok ?
[02:34:53] <Cork> sharpy35: so that means you only have plugin as an option left
[02:34:54] <sharpy35> why so?
[02:35:06] <Cork> cause you can't access the file client side without the filereader
[02:35:15] <montyjanderson> could anyone here answer a question about normalizer for me?
[02:35:29] <sharpy35> ok that makes sense
[02:35:35] <Cork> montyjanderson: not unless you ask the question
[02:35:37] <sharpy35> but i guess there was a way with ActiveXObject
[02:35:46] <montyjanderson> should it be minified?
[02:35:53] <biscuit> On this site I'm working on and according to the inspetor built into chrome, the html tag stops before the end of the page (eg, theres a persistant bit of blank following the end of the page). As the content of the page changes size, the amount of blank after the html tag will be the same size as the largest amount of content in that session. Does anyone have any idea as to why this is happening? I'm resizing my main div container with jquery, is there anything e
[02:36:09] <Cork> montyjanderson: that depends on if you want to
[02:36:27] <montyjanderson> is there no official recommendation?
[02:36:29] <Cork> montyjanderson: minify is just to try to compless the files, and it is up to you if you want to do it
[02:36:36] <sharpy35> montyjanderson: minifing the js means nothingless to minify the size of the http request to make it faster
[02:36:37] <Cork> montyjanderson: uh...
[02:36:52] <montyjanderson> I know what minifying is.
[02:36:58] <montyjanderson> *minifing
[02:37:06] <Cork> montyjanderson: why would there be a recommendation?!?
[02:37:19] <Cork> if you want your scripts minified, do it, else don't
[02:37:22] <montyjanderson> because jquery is supplied with a minified version.
[02:37:38] <Cork> so you look for a minified release?
[02:37:44] <Cork> that isn't recommendation :)
[02:37:50] <montyjanderson> :)
[02:37:56] <montyjanderson> http://montyanderson.co.uk
[02:38:24] <sharpy35> Cork: i guess i will do it that way: First support browsers who support browser with FileReaders access, and if it not i am implementing a fallback to ActiveXObject, if that one isnt enabled i am just showing the fileName
[02:38:36] <sharpy35> or what i can else do i guess is
[02:39:12] <sharpy35> when i am uploading the file with Ajax i can send an asynchronous response to the client which includes the filesize and the fileName right?
[02:39:35] <Cork> sharpy35: like i said you can't use ajax unless you have filereader
[02:40:01] <Cork> and what you can send back depends on the server
[02:40:04] <biscuit> montyjanderson: depending on the size of your normalizer script, minify-ing your script may produce marginal improvements in loading over a non-minified version. It literally is up to you
[02:40:15] <p3lim> Trying to read a js file from js, and chrome is trolling me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/6ya7c/
[02:40:28] <montyjanderson> chrome is trolling you
[02:40:37] <p3lim> I load a test.js file from my desktop, the console prints "C:\fakepath\test.js"
[02:40:41] <Cork> montyjanderson: just so you know, most of the time just zlib:ing the file is often better then minifying it
[02:40:43] <p3lim> Which renders it unusable
[02:41:05] <montyjanderson> I haven't heard of zlib:ing.
[02:41:20] <p3lim> I've tried several different ways of reading the file, without success
[02:41:32] <biscuit> p3lim: its a windows specific security issue
[02:41:34] <sharpy35> Cork: so there is no way of getting the fileSize printed out in ie7 - 9
[02:42:01] <montyjanderson> thanks
[02:42:06] <Cork> sharpy35: no
[02:42:15] <biscuit> p3lim: http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/aspnet-ajax/upload/ie8-upload-control-shows-quot-c-fakepath-quot.aspx
[02:42:32] <p3lim> Got any suggestions on how I could read the contents of a javascript file using javascript?
[02:42:40] <p3lim> Specifically, this will be used in a chrome extension
[02:43:02] <sharpy35> Cork: you are wrong: there is one!
[02:43:13] <Cork> p3lim: is it a js file or a js resource?
[02:43:20] <Cork> sharpy35: ok?
[02:43:21] <p3lim> difference?
[02:43:34] <sharpy35> Cork: i already found that a few seconds ago :) http://forums.asp.net/t/1730310.aspx/1?Find+the+uploaded+file+size+using+java+script+ it is possible with the help of the ActiveXObject but that needs to be enabled
[02:43:49] <Cork> p3lim: a file is something you access like ex for upload, a resource is something you load into the page like an image, css or a javascript
[02:43:52] <sharpy35> otherwise it isnt because you dont have access to the filesystem as you've said
[02:44:13] <Cork> sharpy35: ok, i never care about actuiveXObject, as it is a security nightmare
[02:44:22] <sharpy35> why it is?
[02:44:24] <Cork> so i never did any digging into what it can do
[02:44:38] <Cork> sharpy35: cause it exposes loads of things to the web that shoulnd't be there
[02:44:51] <Cork> sharpy35: it is the major source of security problems in ie
[02:44:59] <p3lim> Cork: File, it won't be accessible or listed in the resources list in the extension, which makes it unreadable within the extension
[02:45:01] <Cork> (so i always disable it in browser i use)
[02:45:04] <p3lim> It's basically a upload
[02:45:21] <Cork> p3lim: then FileReader should be able to help you
[02:45:32] <sharpy35> Cork: ah ok , so i should just ignore that one
[02:45:34] <p3lim> I only need to get the plain text contents out from it
[02:45:48] <p3lim> Already tried filereader, no dice
[02:45:49] <Cork> sharpy35: well you should expect to handle it not working
[02:45:51] <sharpy35> Cork: because i dont want to have an insecure application
[02:46:03] <Cork> sharpy35: but you are free to use it, the security problem isn't for your site, but for the user
[02:46:33] <Cork> sharpy35: what i mean is it has been used to exploit the user though security hols
[02:46:40] <sharpy35> Cork: yeah but i dont want the user who are using it to have a security lack
[02:46:47] <Cork> sharpy35: like running files locally, installations and what not
[02:46:59] <Cork> sharpy35: you can't control that, it is in there settings
[02:47:15] <sharpy35> ok, that sucks, i am stepping away from that solution
[02:47:18] <Cork> and if you don't plan to exploit them, you arn't making there rist higher :)
[02:47:26] <sharpy35> i am not ;)
[02:47:27] <montyjanderson> hello
[02:47:43] <Cork> there security risk is from ms implementing activexobject
[02:47:59] <sharpy35> therefore i am searching for a save solution which works in all browsers
[02:48:08] <Cork> there isn't one
[02:48:32] <Cork> file access in sites has for a long time been really clonky
[02:48:57] <Cork> i made a csv importer in js a few years back
[02:49:02] <sharpy35> ok, so there is no solution of displaying the filesize before in every browser but i am glad i found a solution to display a realtime upload progress for every browser :)
[02:49:15] <Cork> and i had to pipe the csv file over the server to the page so js could access it...
[02:49:17] <Cork> madness...
[02:49:28] <sharpy35> this was just one requirement
[02:49:32] <sharpy35> from me
[02:50:02] <sharpy35> but if its not solvable that i am going to stick with my solution
[02:50:04] <Cork> sharpy35: well you can use activexobject, just make sure to error check each step
[02:50:11] <Cork> so that you catch if the user has disabled it
[02:50:20] <sharpy35> no that would be an overkill
[02:50:28] <sharpy35> and it is not worth it
[02:50:35] <Cork> ya, i agree
[02:50:48] <Cork> i normally just point at modern browser for those features
[02:50:55] <Cork> (and use flash for a fallback)
[02:51:08] <Cork> 99% of all users has it installed anyway
[02:51:29] <sharpy35> i want to but at the project i am working on i got some constraints
[02:51:38] <sharpy35> which wont allow me to use flash
[02:51:45] <Cork> interesting
[02:51:59] <sharpy35> so it sucks
[02:52:00] <sharpy35> xD
[02:52:11] <Cork> well no, but it sounds kinda silly to not allow it for fallbacks
[02:52:24] <Cork> as long as it isn't used unless the clean way isn't possible
[02:52:24] <sharpy35> if i could choose the constraints by myself i wouldnt implement something for older browsers
[02:52:46] <Cork> well a fallback isn't hard
[02:53:10] <sharpy35> i know, but its easier if you just watchout for the modern features
[02:53:20] <sharpy35> which are atm HTML 5 File Api and so on
[02:53:23] <membo> hi! I've got a problem with escaped unicode characters i get in a json response http://pastebin.com/T9VBTt93
[02:54:57] <sharpy35> you know if its possible with ASP.NEt to access the fileSize?
[02:55:09] <sharpy35> or the fileSystem
[02:55:35] <sharpy35> or is it just a browser thing independent from the language
[02:58:07] <seutje> membo: looks like it's mangled before being stored in the DB
[02:59:03] <seutje> membo: heart symbol for me is "\u2764" and definitely won't be more than 2 unicode chars
[03:01:36] <membo> seutje: thanks! that's odd, not how do i get just 1 instead of 3
[03:03:22] <g33kyboi> I just ajaxed a displaytag table links in my portlet app but when i click on the links on the table i discovered that they have been ajaxed with wrong urls... pls how do i get jquery to know the right url?
[03:04:23] <membo> i was looking for \u00e2\u009d\u00a4 and that's what I found: http://pastebin.com/nSSBqEtA, so I have to use a different method to parse the text before submitting it to the db or i have to find a way of converting the 3-part string to just 1
[03:05:01] <g33kyboi> http://pastebin.com/77rJiWAk
[03:12:04] <zhulikas> le question
[03:12:09] <zhulikas> using jquery validator
[03:12:19] <zhulikas> 			rules: {
[03:12:19] <zhulikas> 				login: {
[03:12:19] <zhulikas> 					remote: "/users/usernameExists/" + $("#login").val()
[03:12:19] <zhulikas> 				}
[03:12:19] <zhulikas> 			}
[03:12:23] <zhulikas> how can I force on such url?
[03:12:31] <zhulikas> this is what I get instead:
[03:12:34] <zhulikas> https://localhost:9443/users/usernameExists/?login=asds
[03:15:50] <seutje> zhulikas: at the time ur constructing the url, the value is empty?
[03:15:59] <no_gravity> Hello everybody! I have 2 strings like "10:22" and "11:50" that represent times. Whats an elegant way to calculate the difference in minutes?
[03:16:02] <zhulikas> actually, yes
[03:16:10] <zhulikas> I just tried adding + "/" in the end
[03:16:17] <zhulikas> so I get users/usernameExists//?login=asds
[03:16:30] <seutje> so the ?login shit is added automagically
[03:16:39] <zhulikas> yeah
[03:16:39] <seutje> the stuff ur adding just ends up being an empty string
[03:16:42] <zhulikas> and field value is empty
[03:16:57] <zhulikas> ahhh
[03:17:25] <Dirkos> I used this boilerplate to create a new plugin: https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate
[03:17:31] <zhulikas> wrapping it in a function helps
[03:17:33] <Dirkos> But how can i talk to the plugin after loading it?
[03:17:37] <zhulikas> but ?login=asda is still added in the end
[03:18:49] <zhulikas> yay, got it working :)
[03:27:20] <sharpy35> Cork: with modern browsers i am using FileReader and XHR 2 and with older browser that doesnt support that features i am using i frame transport and session upload progress php directive and ajax ;)  i've found a good tutorial that exactly how to do that one
[03:27:21] <sharpy35> http://www.sitepoint.com/tracking-upload-progress-with-php-and-javascript/
[03:27:50] <airdem> <option>label</option> is there a selector to select the option containing "label" ?
[03:28:04] <sharpy35> though i am using modern techniques in modern browsers and alternative ways for older once
[03:28:22] <Cork> airdem: filter(function() { return this.innerHTML == 'label'; })
[03:28:45] <Cork> airdem: as in find('option').filter(function() { return this.innerHTML == 'label'; })
[03:28:55] <airdem> $('option').filter(function() { return this.innerHTML == 'label'; }) right?
[03:29:00] <Cork> yes
[03:29:03] <airdem> thanks
[03:44:43] <airdem> anybody used http://code.google.com/p/ufd/ before?
[03:50:33] <Cork> airdem: also why are you loading json through iframe?
[03:50:48] <Cork> just use xmlhttprequest
[03:50:58] <airdem> not me
[03:51:27] <Cork> opps wrong channel :x
[03:51:42] <Cork> (and consequently wrong nick >_<)
[03:53:46] <Dirkos> How can i get the instance of the plugin after loading it? http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[03:58:59] <airdem> to get the class i do this.class?
[04:00:19] <Dirkos> airdem: http://bit.ly/18nUTfc
[04:01:05] <airdem> Dirkos, thanks but im looking for smth to use with this and not $(this)
[04:01:13] <airdem> dont know where to look
[04:01:23] <Dirkos> just with plain javascript?
[04:01:38] <rynkan> Has anyone experienced that getImageData gives the wrong colors from a image drawn in a canvas?
[04:01:41] <Dirkos> why are u asking in jquery channel then? :) but ok
[04:01:58] <Dirkos> airdem: this.className;
[04:02:03] <Dirkos> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_classname.asp
[04:02:06] <airdem> thank you
[04:02:20] <rynkan> #112233 returns back as #122936
[04:06:54] <Dirkos> someone experience with http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ ?
[04:07:02] <Dirkos> how can i get the plugin back after its loaded?
[04:07:21] <airdem> rynkan, you want to draw stuff on a canvas?
[04:07:47] <airdem> rynkan, take a look at kineticjs, works pretty good for me
[04:12:02] <g33kyboi> pls i need help: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier//  http://pastebin.com/s3NhJxDx
[04:12:46] <Cork> g33kyboi: what line?
[04:12:52] <grafi> all of them
[04:12:59] <Cork> no
[04:13:04] <Cork> ah lol
[04:14:22] <seutje> what the poop is this?
[04:14:41] <g33kyboi> It throws when i try to click on any of the ajaxed links
[04:14:57] <Cork> g33kyboi: what line is the error from?
[04:15:08] <Cork> the parser should tell
[04:15:29] <Cork> (also for future references please use a rendered page instead of server script
[04:15:30] <Cork> )
[04:15:39] <seutje> I don't even see a click handler of any kind o.O
[04:16:15] <seutje> oh, you replace the href
[04:16:18] <seutje> -_-
[04:16:20] <g33kyboi> yes
[04:16:33] <g33kyboi> i cant tell what line it throws..
[04:16:47] <Cork> g33kyboi: then at least give os a rendered page
[04:16:54] <Cork> *us
[04:17:03] <seutje> forreal
[04:17:15] <seutje> I can't parse <%@
[04:17:46] <Cork> well i can guess at them, but it gets a bot to many variables to find what might introduce the error
[04:18:05] <seutje> prolly line 70, as that's the only place I can find //
[04:18:24] <seutje> oh no wait, 96 as well
[04:18:32] <seutje> don't see why it would bork on that though
[04:19:36] <Cork> i suspect the server parser does something
[04:19:41] <g33kyboi> am developing on a local liferay server...don't know how u can see the render page
[04:19:41] <Cork> but who knows
[04:19:50] <seutje> yeah, that's a good possibility as well
[04:20:01] <seutje> g33kyboi: open it in ur browser and save as
[04:20:04] <Cork> g33kyboi: wget twards the server, or save source in the browser
[04:20:05] <Dirkos> Cork: you know how i can access a plugin which i registered as with a boilerplate?
[04:20:15] <Dirkos> https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/jquery.boilerplate.js
[04:20:48] <Cork> Dirkos:  $().<plugin name>
[04:21:15] <Dirkos> yeah but after i "installed"  it?
[04:21:48] <Cork> what?
[04:22:02] <Dirkos> well i do like: $('#obj').plugin();
[04:22:04] <Cork> you load the library and then access it through $().<function name>
[04:22:20] <Dirkos> but how can i access the plugina fterwards? Like calling a manual function on the plugin
[04:22:34] <Cork> Dirkos: through that call
[04:23:11] <Dirkos> Cork: so i should do a $('object').plugin().stop(); for example?
[04:24:28] <Dirkos> cuz when doing this its not responding on that function
[04:24:44] <Cork> uh
[04:24:49] <Cork> reading through it again...
[04:25:03] <Cork> i don't actually see a direct export of the member functions
[04:25:36] <Cork> only way i see is $().data('plugin_<plugin name>').functions()
[04:25:56] <Dirkos> isnt there a better way? or a diff boilerplate that can do it or something?
[04:27:40] <Cork> Dirkos: there are a huge list of bp's out there
[04:27:59] <Cork> Dirkos: but shouldn't be too hard to modify this one to support it too
[04:28:52] <Dirkos> hmm ok thnx :)
[04:30:13] <g33kyboi> http://pastebin.com/ZfQNC0t1
[04:31:12] <g33kyboi> the source code view looks horrible, tried formatting but didnt get any better
[04:32:05] <Cork> Dirkos: http://jsfiddle.net/hENf4/
[04:32:32] <doug65536> g33kyboi: um, what is that?
[04:32:49] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[04:32:50] <Cork> g33kyboi: looks like the server removes line breaks for you
[04:33:07] <Cork> g33kyboi: causeing // to break things horribly
[04:33:10] <doug65536> or on you
[04:34:07] <g33kyboi> Cork: you suggest, i remove the '//'???
[04:34:18] <Cork> g33kyboi: yes or replace them with /* */
[04:34:44] <doug65536> g33kyboi: jsfiddle cleaned it up a bit http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ZRg4B/
[04:34:51] <Mateo_> I have a map with markers. In these markers theres a link. When I clic on that link, I'd like to open a popup image. How could I do that using query mobile please ? I don't know where to start in fact
[04:37:33] <doug65536> does anyone know how to make a jUnit test case that *expects* a server error (like 500)
[04:37:58] <doug65536> (ajax)
[04:43:29] <g33kyboi> Cork: removed it but  got the same error
[04:48:53] <t4nk536> Hello
[04:49:03] <t4nk536> anyone can help me with a problem please
[04:49:12] <t4nk536> a problem with autocomplete :s
[04:49:59] <t4nk536> :S .-.
[04:53:58] <seutje> Cork: so we were both right, it was the "//", but it was causing problems due to server processing?
[04:54:10] <seutje> ?hi5
[04:54:11] <b-ot> seutje: ⋰⁵⋱
[04:54:20] <Cork> lol
[04:54:37] <Cork> seutje: i never said it wasn't // :)
[04:54:46] <Cork> but i was quite sure the server had something to do with it
[04:54:54] <seutje> I didn't mean to imply you did
[04:55:08] <seutje> I just said u were right, take it, damnit!
[04:55:12] <Cork> seutje: though the error still stays with the change
[04:55:18] <seutje> oh
[04:55:28] <seutje> can we continue to blame the server?
[04:55:29] <seutje> :P
[04:55:47] <Cork> seutje: the resulting page is such a mess who knows
[04:56:19] <Cork> g33kyboi: simplest solution is prob remove everything add it back a few lines at a time untills the error comes back
[04:56:28] <doug65536> I hope he's gzipping that output - it's incredibly repetitious
[04:56:33] <Cork> old ie debugging ftw
[04:58:09] <Cork> doug65536: well java web servers should just be destroyed if you ask me
[04:58:44] <Cork> i've had to fight with those pages a few time, and i have never seen a server mess up the protocol and rendering so bad as jsp can do
[04:59:02] <Cork> (not to mention they are often memory hungry and slow)
[04:59:47] <gvo> cork and time consuming to program
[05:00:03] <slax0r> Cork, it's Java...Java = We'll take that memory and waste a crapload of cpu cycles for basically doing nothing more special than other available stuff
[05:00:24] <Cork> slax0r: well not fully true
[05:00:40] <Cork> slax0r: though for servers yes, most of the time
[05:00:42] <seutje> slax0r: and good look keeping ur versions in check!
[05:00:56] <Cork> look? or luck? :D
[05:00:58] <doug65536> java itself isn't slow, but it is *very* easy to write really slow code that does an enormous amount of work
[05:01:04] <seutje> both :P
[05:01:21] <seutje> write once, run everywh... nope
[05:01:26] <Cork> doug65536: well some of there api is really really slow too
[05:01:31] <gvo> Our company decided to go java/j3ee from perl.  I demonstrated that hello world using java/j2ee took about 30 minutes and somewhere near 15 files.  Whereas Perl took <1 minute and 1 file.
[05:01:48] <Cork> O_o
[05:01:50] <Cork> uh
[05:01:52] <seutje> WAT?
[05:02:02] <Cork> 15 files to say hello world?!?
[05:02:12] <gvo> We had this strange framework we had to use.
[05:02:19] <Cork> with what 3d graphics?
[05:02:25] <doug65536> lol
[05:02:29] <gvo> Nope, just text.
[05:02:49] <slax0r> I'm sure you had the framework to do something more special than just plain hello world
[05:02:49] <Cork> then blame the framework not java
[05:02:55] <gvo> Of course
[05:03:01] <slax0r> so apply the "same framework" that will do that stuff over perl
[05:03:11] <slax0r> and write hello world then
[05:03:31] <gvo> I'm not even sure it would work with perl.
[05:03:40] <slax0r> I'm so lazy today :/
[05:03:43] <doug65536> I had a coworker with a funny comic on the wall that compared languages... C was really simple and straightforward, C++ was more complicated with templates, and the Java picture was this huge mess of patterns and interfaces and adapters and visitors and stuff.  I wish I could find that online
[05:03:59] <gvo> I like it!
[05:04:18] <Dirkos> is there a way to cancel all "fadeIn" etc on an object?
[05:04:26] <doug65536> Dirkos: .stop
[05:04:32] <slax0r> doug65536, it's not the pic you're searching, but: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnqAXuLZlaE
[05:05:06] <fella5s> You are not going to build a skycraper with hammer, but you don't need crane to build a hut. Just choose rigth tool for a rigth job and thats it.
[05:06:30] <slax0r> yeah, because programming languages and dev tools are just like hammers and cranes
[05:09:20] <gvo> slax0r: Great video, thanks for sharing.
[05:09:56] <gvo> Is .not something or just a spoof?
[05:10:57] <Cork> .not?
[05:11:29] <doug65536> Cork: it's in the video that slax0r posted
[05:11:34] <xec> .not() is the opposite of .filter() iirc
[05:11:35] <doug65536> I think it's a joke
[05:12:22] <Cork> hmm must not have gotten there yet then...
[05:12:43] <g33kyboi> Cork: this is really annoying. It's still not working. I ran same code 4hours back and it went through smoothly without errors. I wanted to take the javascript out into a separate js file and then the code these errors cropped in.
[05:13:26] <Cork> g33kyboi: try reduce where it comes from
[05:13:35] <g33kyboi> I've tried reveerting to the previous version that worked but i now get same error
[05:13:57] <g33kyboi> try reduce? how?
[05:14:26] <Cork> g33kyboi: like i said, remove lines, until it starts working again
[05:14:37] <Cork> and then slowly backtrack to fine where it comes from
[05:26:47] <doug65536> http://wtfcontent.com/img/130192542618.jpg
[05:46:13] <g33kyboi> Cork: still not working
[05:46:37] <Cork> g33kyboi: even if you remove all the code you get the same error?
[05:47:10] <g33kyboi> no errors if all code removed
[05:47:29] <g33kyboi> only that i dont get the table links ajax enabled
[05:47:32] <Cork> then start adding them in again and fine where it starts
[05:50:25] <g33kyboi> but the js functions work together and i can't determine functionality of any part without interacting with another
[05:52:49] <fl0w> if I have an input element with id="auth[id]" name="auth[id]", how do I select that specific input using jquery? $('#auth[id]') doesnt seem to work for me?
[05:53:15] <Cork> #auth\\[id\\]
[05:53:31] <Cork> though i would suggest not using [] and . in id's
[05:54:24] <fl0w> Cork: Really? Even for input id's?
[05:54:34] <Cork> for id's; period
[05:54:59] <Cork> fl0w: just from the simple reason it makes it hard to handle them
[05:55:22] <Cork> fl0w: ex convert auth[id] to auth_id
[05:55:30] <Cork> or auth-id
[06:02:58] <jsmonkey> Hi, if I have a reference to a element like var divs = $('div'); and I also want to select all elements with class .monkey as well how can I make use of the variable divs and the css class?
[06:03:14] <sammich> divs.find()
[06:03:22] <jsmonkey> nah
[06:03:27] <jsmonkey> find will search for children
[06:03:30] <jsmonkey> of divs right?
[06:03:38] <sammich> divs.filter()
[06:03:44] <usc9111> Hey guys, is there any way to store an alert in a cookie so that it will only be displayed once on a site?
[06:03:59] <jsmonkey> sammich: nah, that will remove
[06:04:02] <jsmonkey> I want to add :)
[06:04:06] <sammich> divs.add
[06:04:24] <jsmonkey> oh there is add :)
[06:04:28] <sammich> usc9111: check the cookie, then show the alert
[06:04:30] <jsmonkey> how stupid of me now to see that
[06:04:46] <sammich> don't worry, I only learned about it not long ago
[06:04:53] <jsmonkey> worked!
[06:05:02] <sammich> I haven't actually used it in practice though
[06:05:02] <jsmonkey> thanks for the refresher!
[06:05:11] <jsmonkey> it worked fine :)
[06:05:26] <sammich> no worries
[06:06:30] <niels_> Hello - i've got a bootstrap modal with a hidden div, a paragraph and a form field.. when I click save the hidden div can become visible with some text in it. This pushes the paragraph and form field down a bit. But for some reason it doesn't render properly, so a bunch of the form field isn't displaying properly  graphically.. Once I mouse over it/click it or wait a while it'll automatically update after a while though.... This onl
[06:06:47] <niels_> r for keycode 13/enter on the save.. if I click the save button it does work ok
[06:07:01] <niels_> Does anyone know what might be the cause?
[06:22:01] <boytoy> Hi. At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/33/edit (using jQuery Embedly), how do I use Embedly's Services API to only embed videos from YouTube and Vimeo, and not random media from random URLs? http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/service
[06:22:08] <fl0w> Cork: Thanks for your input, I did what you told me to!
[06:28:05] <sammich> suppose I need to position something before it's displayed. Would I just set visibility to hidden, opacity to 0, display to block, then animate opacity?
[06:28:23] <sammich> never mind that visibility
[06:28:30] <Cork> yes
[06:28:45] <sammich> cool beans
[06:28:46] <Cork> visibility is needed if you want to prevent mouse interactions
[06:29:00] <Cork> but if you are going to animate it straight away, no point
[06:29:18] <sammich> gonna animate it right away, but might do it to prevent some edge case weirdness
[06:30:31] <sammich> can I just set visibility:hidden, opacity:0, display:block, then .show(time)?
[06:30:40] <sammich> instead of animating opacity
[06:30:41] <Cork> no
[06:30:49] <sammich> yeah, as I thought
[06:30:50] <dfsd> how does this get loaded when this is placed in my html? <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
[06:31:03] <sammich> the browser loads that up for you
[06:31:11] <Cork> sammich: also you should prob hide it in js instead of in the css file
[06:31:23] <Cork> sammich: so that the content can be read even with js off
[06:31:28] <sammich> Cork: yeah it's gonna be set inline
[06:31:54] <sammich> cheers, Cork
[06:32:27] <Cork> dfsd: 1. the html parser finds it, 2. it gets the browser to request the resource, 3. the loaded resource is handed over to the javascript interpreter
[06:33:12] <redondo> if I select an element (i.e.: $('#some_id') ) that really does not exists, should I get 'undefined' or certain kind Object that does nothing?
[06:33:33] <NoiseEee> redondo: you'll get a jquery object with no length
[06:33:38] <Cork> redondo: you should get a jquery object with zero elements
[06:33:55] <Cork> well it will have a length just zero :)
[06:34:18] <Cork> no length would be length == undefined
[06:34:18] <redondo> NoiseEee, Cork, thank you guys.
[06:34:23] <redondo> ok
[06:34:51] <Cork> redondo: the reason for that is so you don't have to if() case ever thing you do with jquery
[06:35:09] <Cork> redondo: makes the code handling much simpler
[06:36:33] <redondo> Cork, not sure if I get that, but I'll keep on moving. In this particular case, I would prefer to do if(selection) {...}, but let see
[06:37:20] <Cork> redondo: what i meant is ex $('selector').each(function() { $(this).process(); });
[06:38:10] <Cork> if jquery didn't do that you would have to write it as var t =  $('selector'); if(typeof(t) == 'undefined) { t.each(function() { $(this).process(); }) }
[06:38:10] <redondo> Cork, sorry, what does mean 'ex'?
[06:38:25] <Cork> redondo: example
[06:38:29] <redondo> ok
[06:38:54] <Cork> and that would have to go for each chain jquery let you do
[06:39:05] <Cork> so it would become almost pointless to chain functions to it
[06:39:52] <redondo> Cork, ok... It is the javascript way, right... I'll keep thinking on this. I like it.
[06:40:10] <Cork> redondo: no it's the jquery way
[06:40:21] <Cork> javascript is closer to the other solution normally
[06:42:47] <redondo> Cork, I meant: that of chaining functions as if they were object's attributes, is not that caracteristic of javascript?
[06:43:16] <redondo> Cork, not sure what I'm saying!
[06:43:17] <Cork> redondo: not really
[06:43:23] <redondo> ok
[06:43:40] <Cork> redondo: yes you have a global scope and through it you can reach the global functions
[06:43:47] <Cork> and functions can be assigned to objects
[06:44:04] <Cork> but can't say it's explicitly how you usually use js
[06:44:18] <Cork> it's up to the developer most of the time
[06:44:34] <redondo> Cork, ok.
[06:44:38] <redondo> Cork, but It is where js goes beyond, right?
[06:44:51] <Cork> beyond what?
[06:44:56] <redondo> from java, for example.
[06:45:11] <Cork> ya
[06:45:19] <redondo> ya?
[06:45:24] <Cork> some languages has the same structure
[06:45:34] <Cork> but java is closer to c/c++ here
[06:45:48] <Cork> though you could compare it to member functions on a class
[06:45:56] <Cork> though it isn't exactly the same
[06:46:49] <redondo> Cork, in c/c++ you can pass functions as arguments, right, is not that the same discussion=
[06:46:50] <redondo> ?
[06:47:16] <jsmonkey> if I have 3 elements that I want to add a hover to. using .add it set's hover with an enter and leave callback for each element. I would like them to group, is that possible?
[06:47:22] <Cork> uh, no you can't pass function as arguments in c/c++
[06:47:49] <redondo> Cork, are you sure?
[06:48:12] <Cork> redondo: unless the've added something to c++ in the later standards yes
[06:48:29] <redondo> Cork, ok.
[06:48:57] <Cork> jsmonkey: wrap them with a parent and bind mouseenter/mouseleave on it instead
[06:49:30] <jsmonkey> Cork: I got an absolute div that is not children etc
[06:49:34] <jsmonkey> making a menu
[06:49:42] <jsmonkey> therefor I used the .add function.
[06:49:50] <sammich> you can pass blocks into Objective-C though ;)
[06:49:53] <Cork> jsmonkey: the add function won't really help you
[06:50:10] <jsmonkey> Cork: ok :(
[06:50:13] <Cork> jsmonkey: events is per element, not per selector
[06:50:18] <jsmonkey> I see
[06:50:26] <jsmonkey> then I have to rethink my solution
[06:50:58] <jsmonkey> or add an delay on "leave"
[07:01:25] <huglester> Guys I often do: me.parent().parent().... is there a way to tell ie: me.parent('form')? so it goes for example 5 lvls up?
[07:01:47] <huglester> parents('div') work, but it somehow then takes ll divs up
[07:02:10] <Cork> no
[07:02:16] <Cork> closest()
[07:02:25] <Cork> parents will give you all matching parents
[07:02:33] <Cork> and that is rarely what you want
[07:03:01] <sammich> before I found out about closest(), I was using parents('selector:first')
[07:04:41] <doug65536> huglester: me.parent().eq(5) ?
[07:04:44] <doug65536> oops
[07:04:47] <doug65536> huglester: me.parents().eq(5) ?
[07:04:59] <doug65536> 4 actually
[07:05:15] <Cork> doug65536: he wants to match based on the parent selector
[07:05:18] <Cork> not the eq
[07:05:38] <doug65536> Cork: ok, I thought he wanted purely 5 levels up
[07:05:56] <Cork> doug65536: through matching 'form'
[07:06:27] <sammich> what's faster, eq(n) or :nth-child(n)
[07:06:40] <Cork> nth-child if the browser supports it
[07:06:54] <Cork> though they arn't the same thing
[07:07:10] <huglester> well.. I often want for example: to get the parent form object
[07:07:12] <Cork> eq gives you the n'th match, nth-child matches on children to it's parent
[07:07:30] <Cork> huglester: ya, .closest('form
[07:07:31] <patrick__> I'm looking for a way to hide an element on page load but jQuery().ready is not fired soon enough. I need it to be fired as soon as the element exist in the DOM so it isn't rendered at all
[07:07:32] <huglester> because sometimes forms have <fieldset> <section> etc... and you actually don't know how many lvl are there
[07:07:33] <doug65536> huglester: yes, .closest
[07:07:41] <Cork> huglester: * ya, .closest('form') is most likely what you want then
[07:07:45] <huglester> thanks Cork, doug65536
[07:07:48] <huglester> will try now :)
[07:08:29] <sammich> yeah, oops
[07:09:14] <huglester> Cork, doug65536: thanks a lot. works. the code looks way clearer now :)
[07:09:29] <tiky> i have array_a = ['a','b','c'], of variable length, and need to use its items to reference descending keys in an object: obj['a']['b']['c]
[07:09:33] <tiky> how would somebody do that?
[07:09:41] <doug65536> huglester: closest is awesome
[07:10:26] <sammich> how about $(:eq(n)) vs .eq(n)
[07:10:28] <doug65536> tiky: the brackets are redundant. obj.a.b.c works
[07:10:33] <g33kyboi> can some help me with a link to a tutorial on how to handle ajax fallback if error occured (like javascript not being enabled)
[07:10:44] <tiky> i know, but how do i get from the array to the reference?
[07:10:51] <doug65536> tiky: wait what?
[07:11:09] <doug65536> tiky: ah I see...
[07:11:36] <doug65536> tiky: obj[array_a[0]][array_a[1]][array_a[2]]   <-- like that?
[07:11:41] <sammich> tiky, you can use a 'stack', I'll have to demonstrate though
[07:11:45] <tiky> yes, but again, it's of variable depth
[07:12:20] <solancer> hey guys I'm trying out angularjs and I get this error about Request header field X-Requested-With is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
[07:12:36] <solancer> here's the code http://pastebin.com/a6yK14Mn
[07:12:38] <sammich> var stack = obj; path.map(function(v) { stack = stack[v]; });
[07:12:42] <solancer> http://i.imgur.com/thClGJv.png
[07:12:45] <sammich> tiky: I thik that works
[07:12:58] <tiky> trying to parse
[07:12:59] <doug65536> tiky: var o = obj; $.each(array_a, function() { o = o[this]; })
[07:13:49] <sammich> I prefer to use map for arrays and $.each for objects
[07:13:49] <tiky> solancer: the problem isn't in that code
[07:14:15] <doug65536> sammich: map is not for that
[07:14:25] <tiky> sammich: but i need to update the object being traversed
[07:14:26] <solancer> tiky, is it the cross domain resource thingy?
[07:14:33] <tiky> solancer: i believe so yes
[07:14:48] <tiky> IIRC your problem is solved with JSONP, if at all
[07:15:11] <doug65536> sammich: map is like perl map, take one array, pass each thing through a function, return another array of the results
[07:15:15] <solancer> tiky, jsonp I've saw that in the docs
[07:15:24] <solancer> tiky, *seen
[07:15:55] <sammich> doug65536: yeah, I know, I use it as an iterator
[07:16:14] <jsmonkey> doing $('.someClass').not('ul') won't remove the ul from .someClass even tho the ul is a child of .someClass
[07:16:17] <doug65536> sammich: you don't gain anything by using map instead of each, except more overhead
[07:16:17] <jsmonkey> any ideas?
[07:16:50] <sammich> hmm, I gotsa run this through jsperf
[07:17:01] <tiky> jsmonkey: what are you trying to do?
[07:17:44] <tiky> sammich:  i think lib "js-traverse" might solve the problem
[07:18:00] <jsmonkey> when i do $('.someClass') I get 3 divs selected
[07:18:04] <jsmonkey> I want only two of them
[07:18:05] <tiky> ugh but the support is horrible
[07:18:19] <jsmonkey> so trying $('.someClass').not('.classC') sort of
[07:18:38] <sammich> tiky: so the code doug or I doesn't work for you?
[07:18:41] <jsmonkey> but it returns .someClass with the three divs, classA, classB and classC even tho I use .not('.classC')
[07:18:47] <rogeruiz> jsmonkey: use the :not pseudo selector
[07:18:48] <tiky> well it has to update the object in place
[07:18:50] <tiky> not duplicate it
[07:19:05] <doug65536> tiky: there's no duplication. they're references
[07:19:11] <jsmonkey> rogeruiz: true true.. did not think of that but why will not .not work tho?
[07:19:16] <rogeruiz> $('.someClass:not(".classC")')
[07:19:21] <rogeruiz> hmm not sure
[07:19:24] <doug65536> tiky: you think o = obj[this] copies it?
[07:19:33] <tiky> does it not
[07:19:36] <tiky> O_O
[07:19:38] <doug65536> tiky: no
[07:19:51] <tiky> the more u know
[07:20:21] <doug65536> tiky: if the last thing is a number or a boolean or null, it copies that to o - but it's tiny
[07:20:36] <tiky> it's guaranteed to be an object
[07:20:53] <doug65536> tiky: then you're essentially doing a pointer copy at each assignment
[07:20:57] <tiky> so it will never copy it?  only update the reference?  so updating o will change the original object
[07:21:04] <tiky> that's strange, i didn't know it worked that way
[07:21:05] <doug65536> tiky: yes
[07:21:33] <doug65536> tiky: objects are always by reference. if you want to copy it you have to go out of your way to copy it
[07:21:46] <doug65536> tiky: like $.extend
[07:21:56] <tiky> that's handy
[07:22:11] <doug65536> tiky: very handy
[07:22:16] * tiky goes back to massaging his bizarre code 
[07:22:30] <sammich> doug65536: http://jsperf.com/mapvsdollareach ;)
[07:23:23] <sammich> every object is pass by reference
[07:23:29] <sammich> non-objects aren't
[07:23:38] <doug65536> sammich: a.map?
[07:23:48] <sammich> see the setup
[07:24:22] <doug65536> sammich: um, I was talking about $.map. see http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Array.prototype.map
[07:24:34] <doug65536> sammich: a.map is not crossbrowser
[07:25:21] <doug65536> sammich: not that I really care about IE8 though :)
[07:25:39] <sammich> well, I add in that to the prototype if it doesn't exist
[07:25:59] <doug65536> sammich: cool story bro
[07:26:03] <tiky> man this is some beautiful code
[07:26:22] <jedimind> where
[07:26:23] <tiky> i implemented a graph database on top of mongodb and im using javascript to construct a tree from it
[07:26:28] <tiky> lol
[07:27:06] <jsmonkey> rogeruiz: that is not valid syntax
[07:27:10] <sammich> that word looks positively strange to read without the correct caps on the letters
[07:28:08] <doug65536> sammich: this can't be right http://jsperf.com/mapvsdollareach/2
[07:28:56] <rogeruiz> jsmonkey:
[07:29:01] <rogeruiz> just tested it out, it works for me
[07:29:04] <doug65536> sammich: any idea why $.each sucks so bad?
[07:29:08] <rogeruiz> what version of jquery are you using?
[07:29:22] <doug65536> sammich: maybe isOwnProperty is awful and map skips it?
[07:29:22] <sammich> doug65536: you'll have to look up the code
[07:29:31] <sammich> doug65536: just about to suggest
[07:29:34] <sammich> that
[07:29:39] <tiky> im using underscore _.each anyway
[07:29:42] <rogeruiz> jsmonkey: check your double and single quotes
[07:29:43] <jsmonkey> rogeruiz: problem is it removes classC but not the children of classC..
[07:29:55] <rogeruiz> the children share classes?
[07:30:08] <rogeruiz> can you jsfiddle it
[07:30:13] <doug65536> sammich: or your a.map will not work right if someone added stuff to something in the prototype chain
[07:30:22] <jsmonkey> rogeruiz: no they are children of an element with that class
[07:30:42] <sammich> doug65536: a is an array, operating on the array elements
[07:30:48] <sammich> not the properties
[07:31:06] <doug65536> sammich: an idiot could add something to Array.prototype right?
[07:31:45] <sammich> i understand but I don't see how my iterating over an array has anything to do with array prototypes
[07:31:53] <sammich> unless they overwrite Array.map
[07:32:19] <sammich> the prototype thing only rears it's ugly head if you don't use hasOwnProperty()
[07:32:31] <sammich> and even then when you're using a for in loop
[07:32:37] <sammich> only when*
[07:32:59] <doug65536> sammich: yes, .map already skips it, just checked
[07:33:19] <sammich> that's because it's not going over object keys, just the array elements
[07:34:09] <doug65536> still, I'd take IE8 compat over a few microseconds - but for something critical, good to know
[07:34:17] <boytoy> Trying to do some text truncation at http://jsbin.com/okahum/73/edit -- but how do I check if a <p> is too short so I can add some text to it? (i.e. "Hi, read more" should become "Hi, ... read more")
[07:34:35] <sammich> but like I said, I just add the .map prototype if it doesn't exist
[07:34:48] <sammich> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[07:34:53] <boytoy> My current if($('p', this).first().length >= 50) is not working very well.
[07:35:00] <doug65536> sammich: hard to believe that you do that tbh
[07:35:44] <sammich> I'm in a mixed state of using jQuery and not using jQ
[07:36:04] <tw2113> no one's forcing you ;)
[07:36:27] <jsmonkey> sammich: what is jQ, jquerylite?
[07:36:53] <sammich> jQlazy
[07:37:02] <tw2113> i think jQuery light is called js
[07:37:20] <sammich> jQuery lite is probably just sizzle
[07:37:22] <solancer> can anyone suggest a way to access json response from a remote server into my angular.js app
[07:37:38] <sammich> jQuery(:not(sizzle))
[07:37:44] <snover> someone might, if you asked in a channel about angular
[07:37:48] <snover> and not a channel about jquery
[07:38:44] <jsmonkey_> sammich: nah, jquerylite is used by angular. I think they did it as well
[07:39:26] <jsmonkey_> sizzle is just the css selector
[07:39:58] <jsmonkey_> https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/jqLite.js
[07:40:04] <sammich> I know of sizzle, not jQlite
[07:42:52] <sammich> doug65536: back to what I was gonna say, yeah I totally get what you're saying. I'm trying out different stuff and I've in my head that less jQuery (where it's nice and clean) is faster
[07:43:30] <sammich> now I can see I've been betrayed. $.map is faster than .map
[07:44:08] <doug65536> sammich: lol, I know. that's why I said "this can't be right" :)
[07:45:20] <doug65536> sammich: there's nothing wrong with jquery performance. if you try to roll your own cross-browser code you'll likely end up with the same perf, or more bugs because of less handling of quirks
[07:46:08] <boytoy> Is there a neater way to do this? if($('p', this).first().length >= 50) { $('p', this).first().append(' ... <a href="#" class="read_more">read more</a>'); } else { $('p', this).first().append(' <a href="#" class="read_more">read more</a>'); }
[07:46:15] <sammich> for the most common actions, yeah
[07:46:39] <sammich> for high performance loops I might roll into vanillaJS
[07:47:05] <doug65536> boytoy: yes, don't repeat the selector lookup
[07:47:34] <doug65536> boytoy: what is .length checking?
[07:47:58] <boytoy> doug65536: like this? if($('p', this).first().length >= 50) { $(this).append(' ... <a href="#" class="read_more">read more</a>'); } else { $(this).append(' <a href="#" class="read_more">read more</a>'); }
[07:48:44] <doug65536> boytoy: no, more like var p = $('p', this); if (p.first().length >= 50) { p.append ...
[07:48:48] <sammich> var $el = $(this), $pees = $('p', this);
[07:49:02] <boytoy> doug65536: it's suppose to check if the <p> is too short for jQuery.smarttruncation to add a "..." to it -- http://jsbin.com/okahum/73/edit
[07:49:21] <boytoy> oh i see, nice
[07:49:24] <BlakeH> guys, i am calling Click(); on a checkbox that has an onclick event that calls a javascript function. Unfortunately .click(); does not trigger the event. I also tried using .trigger('click') and that also doesn't click the check box and trigger the clicked event :|
[07:49:26] <BlakeH> any suggestions?
[07:49:34] <sammich> boytoy: you might need to extract the string first with .text()
[07:50:05] <BlakeH> So basically i can check the checkbox but i cant trigger the onclick event.
[07:50:39] <doug65536> boytoy: .length on a jquery selector will give you the number of elements it matched
[07:51:09] <sammich> does .click() trigger element.onchange?
[07:51:22] <sammich> I'm thinking not
[07:51:47] <BlakeH> not sure
[07:51:48] <doug65536> sammich: when does click change anything?
[07:51:58] <sammich> sorry, onclick
[07:52:08] <doug65536> sammich: you mean trigger the change of something that is focused and you click a button?
[07:52:21] <sammich> I was wondering if he'sbetter off using onchange/change() instead of 'click'
[07:53:05] <boytoy> sammich: how do i do that?
[07:53:11] <sammich> what I mean, does jquery "event" trigger the vanillaJS on+"event" handlers?
[07:53:16] <boytoy> doug65536: i see
[07:53:37] <sammich>  if (p.first().text().length >= 50) {
[07:53:59] <BlakeH> I have to call Click(); twice to get it to trigger the onclicked event
[07:54:08] <BlakeH> and on the second time it unchecks the box lol.
[07:54:18] <sammich> how are you setting the handler for click?
[07:54:28] <sammich> click(function() {})?
[07:54:48] <BlakeH> Inline
[07:54:48] <sammich> in other words, are you using jQuery to bind an event to the checkbox?
[07:54:49] <BlakeH> @Html.CheckBoxFor(m => m.ContactList[i].ProviderContactCommunicationPreference.WantsCareRequest, new { onclick = "displayAdditionalField(this);" })
[07:55:11] <BlakeH> so not using jquery to bind to it.
[07:55:35] <boytoy> awesome !!
[07:55:39] <doug65536> boytoy: here are my suggested changes http://jsbin.com/okiRaHU/1/edit
[07:55:40] <Trisox> question how would i convert this to jquery ?
[07:55:40] <boytoy> i think i did it: http://jsbin.com/okahum/73/edit
[07:55:40] <Trisox> $('.rootMenu').each(function(index, el){ this.addEventToBinding($(el)); }.bind(this));
[07:56:17] <boytoy> doug65536: i believe i beat you to it =)
[07:56:31] <Trisox> any takers :D
[07:56:54] <boytoy> doug65536: cool i see you changed some other stuff too
[07:56:58] <boytoy> doug65536: thanks a lot man
[07:57:55] <BlakeH> Weird
[07:57:57] <BlakeH> [0].click();
[07:58:04] <BlakeH> appears to check the box and call the event
[07:58:09] <sammich> $(this).find(selector) or $(selector, this)?
[07:58:44] <doug65536> BlakeH: [0] unwraps the jquery wrapper and gives you the raw DOM element, and .click() calls the native browser click
[07:59:10] <doug65536> BlakeH: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.click
[07:59:13] <BlakeH> huh, well i guess jquery was getting in the way a bit?
[07:59:20] <BlakeH> Thanks for the info.
[07:59:33] <sammich> but http://jsfiddle.net/V6wdD/
[07:59:36] <doug65536> BlakeH: no, jquery will always work. not sure about [0].click()
[08:00:12] <Trisox> how to do this in jquery ? $('.rootMenu').each(function(index, el){ this.addEventToBinding($(el)); }.bind(this));	
[08:00:19] <BlakeH> sammich: i know, it normally works but i guess using mvc3 html helpers causes some sort of issue?
[08:00:26] <BlakeH> maybe its the object binding
[08:00:51] <sammich> hard to say unless you've got some code to look at
[08:01:19] <BlakeH> yea, i cant fiddle mvc3 helpers unfortunately.
[08:01:30] <boytoy> i am so happy
[08:01:32] <doug65536> Trisox: what is addEventToBinding?
[08:01:47] <boytoy> you guys are the best
[08:01:52] <clarkk> could someone help me to understand some of this code, under Object Literal, please?  http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/concepts/
[08:02:01] <sammich> Trisox: $('.rootMenu').bind('events list', handler)?
[08:02:13] <BlakeH> http://jsfiddle.net/V6wdD/1/
[08:02:19] <BlakeH> I guess thats what the html renders as.
[08:02:21] <Trisox> addEventToBinding =          addEventToBinding : function( li ) { }
[08:02:22] <Trisox> a function
[08:02:50] <BlakeH> Still works there if you add the #
[08:02:59] <BlakeH> so not sure why in the app it doesn't.
[08:03:01] <doug65536> clarkk: js lets you just conjure up an object like var person = { name: "doug", id=1234, notes="x" }
[08:03:08] <doug65536> oops
[08:03:16] <doug65536> var person = { name: "doug", id:1234, notes:"x" }
[08:03:26] <doug65536> that is called a "literal"
[08:03:30] <sammich> BlakeH: doesn't seem to work on load, eh
[08:03:37] <clarkk> I don't understand why the elements are created and stored in  $i.data( "container", $c ); and then the element can be shown directly from data
[08:03:39] <BlakeH> Yea i forgot the #
[08:03:42] <tiky> can $.each not access variables in global scope?
[08:03:43] <doug65536> clarkk: a string literal is "Hello"
[08:03:49] <tiky> having weird results
[08:04:01] <clarkk> doug65536: sorry, I do understand object literals, it's just some of the code in that code example
[08:04:15] <clarkk> doug65536: see the createContainer function
[08:05:03] <clarkk> doug65536: the div is created and stored in the container key of data, and then later on shown with myFeature.$currentItem.data( "container" ).show();
[08:05:04] <sammich> BlakeH: right, my bad. So that seems to work alright?
[08:05:25] <clarkk> doug65536: how can this work?
[08:05:56] <tiky> oh crikey, it's just trying to iterate through each character in the string O_O
[08:06:01] <doug65536> clarkk: that code is a mess...
[08:06:12] <doug65536> clarkk: it assigns $currentItem in showItem()
[08:06:23] <doug65536> clarkk: it's a terrible code example
[08:06:33] <clarkk> doug65536: hehe
[08:07:16] <clarkk> doug65536: ok, if we put the quality aside, and assuming it works as described, what is the author using data() for?
[08:07:20] <sammich> what, you can use dot-notation in var declarations?
[08:07:38] <doug65536> clarkk: to store information on DOM elements
[08:07:51] <sammich> .data() stores data next to the DOM, but in jQuery's storage
[08:07:51] <clarkk> doug65536: it seems to be storing the actual elements
[08:08:10] <sammich> that's $().data()
[08:08:23] <clarkk> sammich: I know that bit ;)
[08:08:35] <doug65536> clarkk: what part don't you understand?
[08:08:41] <clarkk> sammich: it's not what it does that I don't understand - it's the way it is being used here
[08:08:53] <doug65536> clarkk: you know what $(..selector...).data(...) does right?
[08:09:08] <clarkk> yes
[08:09:21] <sammich> I think he's going 'WHYYYY?!'
[08:09:25] <clarkk> how can you show() and hide() directly from .data()?
[08:09:39] <doug65536> clarkk: it is chaining
[08:09:48] <sammich> yeah, that
[08:10:14] <doug65536> clarkk: myFeature.$currentItem.data( "container" ).load( url, callback )    means     myFeature.$currentItem.data( "container" );     myFeature.$currentItem.load(...
[08:10:28] <doug65536> oh wait,
[08:10:35] <doug65536> I see that is 1 parameter data
[08:10:43] <doug65536> ok so it stores elements in data, so what?
[08:10:57] <clarkk> then it shows them
[08:10:59] <sammich> it's getting the jquery element back from .dat() then calling methods on it
[08:11:31] <doug65536> clarkk: .data doesn't have to store text. jquery selectors and arbitrary objects can be stored there too
[08:12:10] <sammich> it's a handy feature
[08:12:31] <clarkk> doug65536: why hasn't he just appendTo the dom and then shown/hidden it? I don't understand the purpose in this case
[08:12:46] <doug65536> clarkk: as I said, awful code example
[08:12:48] <sammich> must like normal JS and element.whateverattributeyouwant = {'blah':'I like peonies'};
[08:13:03] <sammich> much like*
[08:14:21] <doug65536> clarkk: that is an awful, convoluted, terrible piece of code to show on a "code organization" page. more like "code disorganization"
[08:14:45] <clarkk> so with myFeature.$currentItem.data( "container" ).show(); - is it actually appended to a visible element in the dom?  If not, it seems like it is being shown out of thin air
[08:14:46] <sammich> I think the idea is to demonstrate the structure, not the content
[08:15:15] <doug65536> clarkk: you need to decipher the mess that sets $currentItem first, to understand that far
[08:15:33] <sammich> clarkk: jquery elements are references to actual elements. so storing it means you can refer to it again
[08:15:39] <sammich> without looking it up
[08:15:53] <mike_af> Quick question: I'm running several $.ajax() calls in a for loop, and want to execute one callback when they are done. I've looked into $.when(), but it looks like that requires the $.ajax() calls be passed directly. What would be the best approach here?
[08:15:54] <sammich> so you can just hit up the element to run methods on it
[08:16:41] <mike_af> I'm leaning towards writing a new function that accepts the args used in the for loop and returns an $.ajax() obj, and then passing all of those to the $.when() call
[08:16:50] <mike_af> is that the most efficient way?
[08:16:58] <doug65536> mike_af: make an array of return values from the ajax calls and then use that array for when
[08:17:26] <sammich> what I was gonna suggest
[08:17:28] <mike_af> doug65536: so you're saying to keep the for loop with each $.ajax() call and let the calls execute?
[08:17:46] <mike_af> and then run the $.when()?
[08:18:05] <doug65536> mike_af: sure. var calls = [];  for (...) { calls.push($.ajax ...); } $.when(calls, ...
[08:18:12] <sammich> inside the .done() you check if the return values are all 'finished', then run your method
[08:18:46] <mike_af> ah ok, thanks!
[08:20:11] <clarkk> ok doug65536 - ok, what is being assigned to $c - is it the <li> containing the new div.container, or is it just the new div.container?  var $c = myFeature.config.$container.clone().appendTo( $i );
[08:20:54] <clarkk> presumably the former
[08:21:35] <doug65536> clarkk: $container is like a "template", it clones it and appends it to $i, which is whatever was passed as this in the $items.each
[08:21:59] <clarkk> ok, so it is the <li>?
[08:22:05] <doug65536> clarkk: so yes, it clones that div and puts one as a child of each li
[08:22:43] <clarkk> doug65536: then as sammich was saying, it's stored in data so that jquery does not have to search the dom again?
[08:22:46] <doug65536> clarkk: it puts a "<div class='container'></div>"  in each <li> under #myFeature
[08:23:44] <doug65536> clarkk: yes, it caches the div it appended as an element because it has no reliable way to lookup that object
[08:24:08] <clarkk> doug65536: ah that's true
[08:26:52] <doug65536> clarkk: I definitely don't like line 28 - it's dumb. the "item" id has to be the element id?
[08:26:55] <doug65536> clarkk: lame
[08:27:42] <doug65536> clarkk: I would have liked to see .data("itemid")
[08:28:04] <clarkk> yeah, I suppose as long as it's unique it will work tho doug65536
[08:28:59] <doug65536> clarkk: .css("background-color") would probably "work" too
[08:29:02] <clarkk> doug65536: I'm wondering if setting a common $currentItem could potentially cause a race condition in an edge case situation
[08:29:14] <clarkk> heh
[08:29:17] <mls_> hi all
[08:29:43] <doug65536> clarkk: how is a race condition even possible? nothing is async, and js is single threaded
[08:30:00] <clarkk> ok
[08:30:15] <clarkk> it just seems really wrong to use a common $currentItem
[08:30:20] <clarkk> I am not sure why
[08:30:47] <doug65536> clarkk: if it set that then returned then later expected it to be correct, that would be a problem
[08:31:11] <clarkk> horrible method naming too - using showContent to show the div, and hideContent to hide the siblings
[08:31:41] <doug65536> clarkk: yes
[08:31:47] <mls_> question : using liferay (a portal), we want to add some google analytics to our pages. Liferay allows us to add the GA id to the pages we want, doing a document.write("<script[...]ga.js"/>. Then, in my pages, I call the GA api in my jquery document ready code. Fact is it behaves like script isn't loaded at the time I call it. Any idea ?
[08:32:04] <doug65536> clarkk: it's more of a "look what I can do" showoff example than a nice clean example to learn from
[08:32:05] <clarkk> doug65536: thank you very much for working this through. I do understand it now
[08:32:31] <doug65536> clarkk: np
[08:33:04] <tiky> o = $scope.tree;  z = ["a","b","c"];  $.each(z, function(){ o = o[this] });  o['property'] = whatever <---- i expect this to modify $scope.tree, but it doesn't
[08:33:08] <tiky> how in god's name do i do this
[08:33:09] <clarkk> doug65536: definitely. Although...when writing docs, it can be really difficult to think up a concise example that looks like something that someone would write in the real world
[08:33:31] <doug65536> clarkk: yes, writing documents is rough
[08:33:32] <duch_kazatel> mls_ "it behaves like script isn't loaded at the time I call it." <- clarify?
[08:33:42] <clarkk> doug65536: doc writing seems easy - but it's actually quite a nightmare ;)
[08:33:48] <clarkk> hehe exactly
[08:33:52] <tiky> specifically i expect it to modify $scope.tree.a.b.c = whatever
[08:34:07] <doug65536> tiky: it definitely will
[08:34:21] <tiky> it isn't, i'm looking at the console log
[08:34:23] <doug65536> tiky: I'll prove it in a fiddle
[08:34:37] <tiky> $scope.tree remains as { }
[08:35:47] <mls_> duch_kazatel: well GA code is not called because if it was, I would see it on GA console. If I launch chrome javascript console and call the code, I see it on GA console
[08:36:05] <doug65536> tiky: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/
[08:36:39] <Trisox> men
[08:36:42] <doug65536> tiky: it starts as nothing? well why didn't you say so?
[08:37:36] <duch_kazatel> mls_ looking at the liferay wiki, you only need to give that system the id and it does the rest for you.
[08:39:10] <doug65536> tiky: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/2/
[08:39:15] <bartek> Has anyone seen this kind of behaviour? It's odd, I'm using this technique: $(selector, htmlBlob), in order to find just the selector inside a blob of HTML, but within my app, I get " Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <....the dump of the html text", htmlBlob is a typeof string, so I have no clue what I am doing wrong. Same code in jsbin (http://jsbin.com/IbeBeLi/1/) works fine.
[08:39:19] <mls_> duch_kazatel: well.. it isn't. But fact is liferay is using a minifier for javascript. So when my code is : var _gaq = _gaq || []; (GA object), the code I see in chrome js console is var a= a ||[]; I don't know if JS can do the link between a and _gaq
[08:40:29] <mls_> as _gaq must be defined in the ga.js imported script from GA, and there is no link to "var a"...
[08:40:42] <duch_kazatel> mls_ without seeing this setup, it's hard to know what could be wrong, but the GA js doesn't care about that "link"
[08:40:42] <tiky> i believe you, i think its a prob with underscore's each scope
[08:40:54] <doug65536> tiky: I solved it for you
[08:40:54] <duch_kazatel> could you send me a jsfiddle of what you're seeing?
[08:41:14] <doug65536> tiky: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/2/   <--- can create new objects
[08:41:19] <mls_> duch_kazatel: doing that
[08:42:29] <duch_kazatel> mls_ you're JUST entering the ID and nothing else in that system, right?
[08:43:01] <mls_> duch_kazatel: yes
[08:43:23] <mls_> duch_kazatel: and i see that the script is loaded by liferay
[08:43:51] <duch_kazatel> mls_ then what was that bit about adding it to the doc ready?  you shouldn't need to do that.
[08:47:45] <adffaasdf> echo CHtml::radioButtonList('base_select','base_select',array('loan'=>$model->total,'balance'=>$model->balance,), array( 'separator' => "  " , 'id'=>'base_select' , 'onchange' => 'change(this.value);') ) ;
[08:47:57] <adffaasdf> why this return empty
[08:48:38] <mls_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/HuBr3/
[08:49:12] <adffaasdf> mls
[08:49:27] <doug65536> tiky: cleaned it up http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/7/
[08:49:33] <tiky> doug65536: the problem is actually that i have to update the subject of the pointer, o, with ANOTHER object
[08:49:38] <tiky> i think that's what's breaking it
[08:49:52] <doug65536> tiky: that will work too
[08:49:54] <mls_> duch_kazatel: fact is liferay doesn't allow us to track portlet content, as inside a portlet we can have many pages, which rely on the same url. And liferay will check for url changes by example.
[08:50:15] <adffaasdf> why
[08:50:16] <tiky> well not the same way, no
[08:50:24] <tiky> because if i just write o=z, it'll just change the pointer of o to z!
[08:50:50] <doug65536> tiky: well, I'll try to help if you can describe what you want to do
[08:50:56] <montyjanderson> hello
[08:51:04] <doug65536> tiky: no XY problems please. tell me what you really want to do, big picture
[08:51:24] <adffaasdf> can anyone help
[08:52:10] <tiky> doug65536: your code, except it has to make a['property'] a clone of another object
[08:52:19] <tiky> i mean o['property']
[08:53:04] <duch_kazatel> mls_ not sure what that has to do with anything.  your code looks wrong to me - if this is autogenerated by your setup, you need to patch it or contact the company that maintains it because it looks wrong to me.
[08:53:21] <doug65536> tiky: ok, to clone you do .property = $.extend(true, {}, ...object to clone...)
[08:53:34] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, how do I get the date from the cell? See: http://jsfiddle.net/5DJT6/
[08:53:38] <Gmac_> i have a anchor with an image inside. I'm trying to grab the src of the image and make it the anchors href
[08:53:53] <Gmac_>    $('.fancybox a').attr('href', $(this).find('img').attr('src'));
[08:54:04] <Gmac_> works only for the first anchor
[08:54:19] <Gmac_> after that it sets all the other anchors in fancy box to the first anchors image
[08:54:51] <doug65536> Gmac_: that 'this' isn't doing what it looks like you think it does
[08:54:59] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[08:55:07] <Gmac_> isn't this the anchor
[08:55:09] <Gmac_> current anchor
[08:55:48] <Gmac_> so… how do i tell it like each(0
[08:55:49] <Gmac_> ?
[08:55:52] <doug65536> Gmac_:  $('.fancybox a').each(function() { var elem = $(this); elem.attr('href', elem.find('img').attr('src')); });
[08:55:55] <tiky> that doesn't change it in place doug65536
[08:56:07] <tiky> however setting the object keys one by one (they're known at the leaf nodes) DOES work
[08:56:07] <doug65536> tiky: do you know what a clone is?
[08:56:13] <tiky> a clone in mem?
[08:56:20] <Gmac_> thanks ill try it
[08:56:26] <doug65536> tiky: doesn't change what in place?
[08:56:45] <tiky> doesn't change o['property'] in place...or in my case, just o
[08:57:09] <doug65536> tiky: did you even look at the fiddle I wrote for you?
[08:57:11] <tiky> o must become a clone of z, which is a leaf node containing a couple known properties
[08:57:23] <tiky> yeah i did, that's what i'm referring to
[08:57:28] <adffaasdf> anyone here using yii
[08:57:46] <tiky> o['property'] = (anything but an obj) works
[08:57:49] <doug65536> tiky: ok, go look at the console output and click thru its properties and tell me it isn't changing it in place
[08:58:07] <tiky> ...where do you think i got that idea from?
[08:58:30] <doug65536> tiky: stop telling me Y when you are trying to solve X. what are you doing?
[08:58:47] <tiky> .... how to explain
[08:59:01] <Gmac_> it worked cool
[08:59:22] <tiky> i have a flat list of nodes, each is an object containing meta info (including id) and an array of ancestry ids
[08:59:31] <tiky> the point is to construct a tree from that flat list
[08:59:35] <Gmac_> i have a unrelated quesiotn. has anyone ever used fancy box? how can make the anchor open an image that is on another rpage on my website ?
[08:59:35] <adffaasdf> why the hell i'm keep getting empty value ? NAN
[08:59:45] <Gmac_> is there a way to target an id on another page or somethin?
[09:00:02] <Gmac_> i only know how to use oimages on this page or a file
[09:00:03] <adffaasdf> do you guys understand this code ?
[09:00:09] <tiky> specifically, making each object a member of array property "children" of its ancestor node
[09:00:12] <adffaasdf> echo CHtml::radioButtonList('base_select','base_select',array('loan'=>$model->total,'balance'=>$model->balance,), array( 'separator' => "  " , 'id'=>'base_select' , 'onchange' => 'change(this.value);') ) ;
[09:00:17] <doug65536> tiky: ok so you want it in reverse. you have the child and you want to make parents
[09:00:35] <tiky> no, i just put it into english like that
[09:00:42] <tiky> it starts with the root nodes
[09:01:00] <tiky> here is the code....
[09:01:05] <doug65536> tiky: then what I gave you will do it. did you see this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/7/
[09:01:46] <tiky> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6425851
[09:03:47] <mike_af> If i have multiple $.ajax() calls in a $.when(), is there an equivalent of $.ajax.always()? I don't care if some of the ajax calls fail, but I want to see them all in the results. From looking at the docs, it looks like it's deferred.then(doneCallbacks, failCallbacks), but no always
[09:04:00] <doug65536> tiky: line 13 is where it goes wrong...
[09:04:14] <tiky> yeah that's the prob ;)
[09:04:16] <doug65536> tiky: o.something would work
[09:04:34] <tiky> well unless i withhold the last element of the array, i can't do that
[09:04:50] <tiky> pop and withhold
[09:05:10] <doug65536> tiky: what you want doesn't make any sense
[09:05:26] <doug65536> tiky: a.b.d.e.WHAT
[09:05:29] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, how do I get the date from the cell? See: http://jsfiddle.net/5DJT6/
[09:05:33] <tiky> maybe not without the insane context
[09:05:45] <doug65536> tiky: think about it
[09:05:54] <tiky> ?
[09:06:25] <doug65536> tiky: you want to store directly to the last thing in the path???
[09:06:57] <tiky> yes, i'm constructing a tree, the last thing in O at any point has to be a leaf node
[09:07:47] <doug65536> ok, I'll hack my fiddle to give you that
[09:09:13] <tiky> the current code (if you uncomment the manual o.whatever definitions, and comment out the $.extend stuff) actually just replaces $scope.tree every time
[09:09:27] <tiky> every time it runs through the outer $.each
[09:11:57] <doug65536> tiky: this must be what you want http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/10/
[09:12:46] <tiky> looks like it, let me try
[09:13:56] <jop008> how to set a style to an element?
[09:14:05] <jop008> .style ?
[09:14:06] <duch_kazatel> .css()
[09:14:10] <grafi> .css
[09:14:12] <b-ot> grafi: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[09:14:17] <grafi> wat
[09:14:29] <duch_kazatel> lmao i love that gif.
[09:14:32] <grafi> lol
[09:14:40] <grafi> b-ot loves it too
[09:15:10] <tiky> doug65536: but i can't update "t" itself?
[09:16:14] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, how do I get the date from the cell? See: http://jsfiddle.net/5DJT6/
[09:17:20] <doug65536> tiky: t.node is the node above the leaf. t,node[t.name] is the leaf
[09:17:43] <tiky> oh ic
[09:19:04] <doug65536> tiky: so in the first test, $scope.tree.b.c.d exists, but not d yet. then it assigns c.d = 10
[09:19:28] <doug65536> oops,
[09:19:35] <doug65536> in the first test, $scope.tree.b.c exists, but not d yet. then it assigns c.d = 10
[09:21:58] <doug65536> tiky: this cleans it up http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QngKS/11/

[09:27:32] <defaultro> hey guys, when is it ideal to use PUT rather than POST?
[09:30:16] <tiky> almost got it doug65536
[09:32:46] <tiky> ah :D:D:D got it

[09:38:10] <jop008> Hi doug how to set a class to a tr  node?
[09:39:54] <tw2113> $('tr').addClass('foo');
[09:40:54] <doug65536> jop008: hi
[09:43:27] <jop008> Simple as you know it :-)
[09:54:14] <jop008> I changed the row to .option {
[09:54:15] <jop008> color:yellow;
[09:54:16] <jop008> }
[09:54:27] <jop008> but no yellow on my tr node
[09:54:42] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[09:54:48] <jop008> so the styyle is called option
[09:54:53] <doug65536> jop008: you did .addClass('option') ?
[09:54:57] <jop008> tr class = option
[09:55:04] <jop008> addclass I did
[09:55:23] <doug65536> color is the text color
[09:55:29] <doug65536> not background
[09:57:03] <jop008> addclass immeadetley effective?
[09:57:09] <doug65536> yes
[09:57:20] <jop008> color is text color indeed
[09:57:43] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/MZMAs/
[09:58:49] <doug65536> jop008: $('tr') will change every row on the page. what are you actually doing though?
[09:58:58] <jop008> Maybe I know what is going on I add a class but not removing the persent class
[09:59:14] <jop008> so I have a class text is blue and another text is yellow
[09:59:21] <jop008> what would be the color?
[09:59:37] <doug65536> jop008: hard to say. probably the last class but I'm not sure
[09:59:39] <jop008> So how to treat this?
[09:59:46] <doug65536> .removeClass
[09:59:49] <doug65536> or
[10:00:01] <jop008> but it is in a onchange routine
[10:00:05] <doug65536> you can just force the color using .css({'color': 'red'})
[10:00:11] <doug65536> or yellow or whatever
[10:00:14] <jop008> so I must know what the class was
[10:00:26] <jop008> but I can find out that
[10:01:14] <doug65536> you can do .removeClass('red blue yellow').addClass(...whatever...)
[10:01:43] <doug65536> jop008: ^
[10:02:22] <wrp6> I have a collection c_1 (an Object object) that maps labels to arrays of arrays. I'm calling $.extend(true, c_1, c_2) to recursively merge c_2 into c_1, but c_2 is overwriting the arrays in c_1. Anything simple I'm missing here?
[10:03:12] <doug65536> wrp6: anything in c_2 will overwrite c_1
[10:03:21] <doug65536> wrp6: arrays aren't merged
[10:03:40] <wrp6> Is there a reason for that?
[10:03:59] <wrp6> I appreciate your diagnosis though, I missed that it only mentioned recursive merging for objects
[10:04:01] <doug65536> wrp6: because it would be expensive, and $.extend wasn't intended for that
[10:04:33] <wrp6> Should I write my own?
[10:05:06] <doug65536> wrp6: yes, you can use indexOf to see if the target contains each source value, and push it in if indexOf returns < 0
[10:05:42] <wrp6> Ah
[10:05:45] <doug65536> wrp6: I made a fiddle for someone a while ago
[10:06:11] <wrp6> It's fine I'll figure it out, thanks
[10:12:55] <BillCriswell> wrp6: Do you have some code to look at? What you're doing seems right.
[10:15:56] <doug65536> BillCriswell: if a property of c_2 has the same name as a property in c_1, c_2's propery overwrites c_1's, even if they are arrays - there is no array merge
[10:19:23] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I somehow missed the array part of it?
[10:20:15] <doug65536> BillCriswell: " ... but c_2 is overwriting the arrays in c_1 ..."
[10:20:30] <BillCriswell> doug65536: $.extend( true, { foo: [1,2,3] }, { foo: [4] }) I did that for fun, didn't come back with what I expected. returns { foo: [4,2,3] }
[10:21:31] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I've missed much more obvious things.
[10:21:56] <doug65536> BillCriswell: yeah, me too. sometimes I answer a question they didn't even ask :D
[10:22:31] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Same.
[10:22:58] <doug65536> yesterday, someone asked, " /\.(gz)$/  does that match things that end with gz"    lol, then I said gz is a compressed file format, like zip
[10:23:42] <BillCriswell> Mmmmm, needless regular expressions.
[10:25:33] <jop008> I remove the right class but still no update
[10:25:43] <jop008> try to make a fiddle of it
[10:25:55] <doug65536> jop008: is it jquery mobile?
[10:26:06] <jop008> as always
[10:26:36] <doug65536> jop008: hmm, nevermind. I tried jqm in jsfiddle and it didn't make any difference. sure, make a fiddle if possible
[10:41:40] <Trudko> Guys anybody using tablesorted with editable widget?(http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-editable.html) I am trying to edit date field and I would apprieciate date picker there

[10:51:12] <gvo> Since it looks like the jquery templates plugin is dead what is anyone using for a simple template engine that works well with jquery?
[10:51:20] <jop008> it doens't remove the class
[10:55:56] <Trudko> Hmm other question anybody using jquery tablesorter editable? I want to find out which cell got updated -_-
[10:56:13] <Trudko> there is updateComplete event but which pass you event objecty but event.target is whole table not just cell
[10:57:26] <doug65536> jop008: see PM or http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/142/
[10:57:51] <doug65536> jop008: use # to select by id
[10:58:54] <doug65536> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/143/
[10:59:42] <doug65536> jop008: if you use <button>Text</button> then the text goes in the element, if you use <input value="Text"> then the text goes in value attribute
[11:00:02] <doug65536> jop008: type="button" I mean
[11:03:16] <boytoy> found out how to limit jquery embedly embeds to youtube and vimeo only for those who are interested: http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/38/edit (may contain some nudity)
[11:04:01] <jop008> I added http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/144/ addclass to it but it not updated
[11:04:48] <NoiseEee> jop008: compare your line to the one above it.
[11:05:08] <NoiseEee> jop008: half the shit you write is copy-pasted, without thinking.  youve been in here for weeks without learning.  anyone who helps you deserves medals.
[11:05:28] <jop008> Thx
[11:05:40] <NoiseEee> you have no idea what the basics are.  and 144 revisions to do what you'er trying to do is...
[11:05:59] <NoiseEee> anyways, sorry to insult, more of a warning to others about help vampires who can't be bothered to learn shit.
[11:27:12] <d0den> I have a set of user variables stored in localstorage. The variables control volume levels of audio streams. I'd like for the user to be able to share the custom audio levels they create via a unique URL, i.e. encode the variables in a URL and then pull them out again when the URL is loaded. Is there an easy way to do this with jQuery or JS?
[11:28:00] <snover> yes.
[11:50:03] <Ziber> Can I enact jquery events, particularly .blur(), on an element that I .load()?
[11:50:40] <redondo> can I bind a input text box to the 'load' event: $('#id_text_input').load(handler) ?
[11:50:54] <redondo> I'm trying but does not work.
[11:51:01] <NoiseEee> redondo: an input element has no 'load' event.
[11:51:05] <redondo> oh
[11:51:05] <NoiseEee> Ziber: sure?
[11:51:57] <redondo> How do I know what elements have what events?
[11:52:01] <Ziber> NoiseEee: I'm working in a bit of a convoluted setup, but it's not working. And by "not working", I mean it doesn't think the element that I .load() exists.
[11:52:38] <NoiseEee> Ziber: maybe it doesn't when you're asking to blur() it, but why blur() it at all, since it generally wouldn't be focused?
[11:52:50] <NoiseEee> redondo: <img>, <script> and the document.
[11:53:01] <Ziber> it's a blurred event. I'm not bluring from it, I want to do an action when it is blurred.
[11:53:29] <redondo> NoiseEee, thank. That is for input elements, how do I know in general?
[11:54:17] <NoiseEee> Ziber: $(someParentThatExistsWhenPageLoaded).on('blur','.classOfElementLoaded',function(){});
[11:54:37] <dievs> Anyone can suggest a very good Image Upload + Crop + Rotate plugin?
[11:54:40] <NoiseEee> redondo: only <img>, <script> and the main document have 'load' events,
[11:55:29] <redondo> NoiseEee, ok, I got it. But how do I know what elements have what events, in general, not just input ones?
[11:56:12] <NoiseEee> redondo: give http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_events.html a read
[11:56:31] <redondo> NoiseeEee, great, thanks.
[11:57:51] <Ziber> NoiseEee: Oooh, that's a good idea.
[11:59:53] <Ziber> I'm getting really pissed off by Chrome's Inspect.
[12:00:17] <Ziber> NoiseEee: $("#answer").on("blur", "li input", function() { }); right?
[12:00:35] <NoiseEee> sure, try it and see?
[12:00:50] <Ziber> Well, it failed and I'm having trouble figuring out why.
[12:01:11] <NoiseEee> well that code specifically does nothing, right?
[12:02:30] <Ziber> NoiseEee: There's a large function in there, just wasn't gonna paste it here.
[12:02:49] <NoiseEee> Ziber: well, debug? is the event firing? the selectors correct?  jsfiddle, as always :)
[12:03:02] <Ziber> Yeah, let me mock this up in jsfiddle.
[12:08:06] <Ziber> Hm. On second though, it's really hard to do that. I'm pretty sure it's not firing.
[12:08:27] <grafi> well thats easy anough to check
[12:08:46] <NoiseEee> is #answer in the document when you assign it? any console errros, Ziber
[12:09:05] <Ziber> #answer is in the document from the beginning, yes.
[12:09:44] <Ziber> And I keep checking in Chrome's Inspect, which freezes when it dies.
[12:10:31] <Ziber> It just points to line 3 of jquery-stable.js, which doesn't help much.
[12:11:00] <Ziber> I through an alert() into the event - it's not firing.
[12:12:29] <grafi> you can exclude jquery and the like from the debug tools in chrome afaik
[12:12:39] <grafi> so it will point to your actual code
[12:12:58] <Ziber> How would I do that?
[12:13:06] <grafi> im looking for it
[12:13:15] <grafi> i saw paul irish talk about it somewhere
[12:13:24] <Ziber> oh, hm, because that'd be really useful.
[12:13:30] <grafi> yeah
[12:13:54] <grafi> if onlyi could find where I saw him say it xD
[12:13:59] <jjmalina> does $.ajax CORS work in IE w/ XDomainRequest or is that something I should handle on my own?
[12:15:54] <Ziber> grafi: yeah... :(
[12:19:13] <shoky> jjmalina: in IE8 and IE9 CORS is only supported w/ XDR. from IE10 cross-domain xhr is fine
[12:19:32] <shoky> jjmalina: for XDR support you need an extra script to add the xdr transport
[12:19:54] <Whirl3d> Hey guys, what is the alternate animate syntax? I remember $(elem).animate({prop:val},dur,ease,func) but there's another way like $(elem).animate({prop:val},{duration:dur, ease:ease, func:ffunction})    Can't seem to get it right
[12:19:59] <jjmalina> shoky, right is there a standard way of doing so w/ jQuery for IE8 & (?
[12:20:06] <Whirl3d> hey shoky! How goes it?
[12:20:07] <shoky> jjmalina:  include this  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[12:20:26] <shoky> hey Whirl3d, it.. goes :P sup
[12:20:30] <jjmalina> shoky: thanks!
[12:20:49] <grafi> Ziber http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHPV8EBlz-A&t=21m55s found it, its only a devtools experiment so far
[12:20:50] * Ziber yawns
[12:20:50] <Whirl3d> same ole same ole, struggling through WordPress...bah.
[12:20:57] <shoky> eek
[12:21:05] <Ziber> hm.
[12:21:27] * grafi laughs at Whirl3d s misery
[12:21:38] <imsohi> hi hi
[12:21:40] <grafi> im mean :(
[12:21:48] <Whirl3d> lol, trust me I understand.
[12:22:15] <Ziber> devtools?
[12:22:19] <shoky> Whirl3d: you wrote the .animate correctly.. except some of the option names
[12:22:28] <Whirl3d> no compassion for the self-inflicted
[12:22:51] <shoky> `api animate
[12:22:52] <b-ot> shoky: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:24:04] <Whirl3d> I was having the hardest time getting the api.jquery.com site to load earlier.
[12:24:08] <Whirl3d> thanks shoky.
[12:24:20] <shoky> most welcome
[12:24:55] <Ziber> hrm.
[12:25:33] <Whirl3d> Oh yeah! THey added deferred methods to animate...
[12:25:55] <redondo> how can I wait for an input element to be loaded?
[12:26:30] <Whirl3d> redondo, you mean for someone to enter input into an input element?
[12:26:52] <Whirl3d> or the elment to appear in the dom
[12:26:53] <redondo> no, for the element to be loaded within the document
[12:26:56] <redondo> yes
[12:27:19] <Whirl3d> I think you would have to wait for the document to be loaded, then search for the element
[12:27:26] <Whirl3d> but maybe there's another way?
[12:27:26] <redondo> ok
[12:27:45] <Jemt> Hi. I need to load multiple versions of jQuery UI. That's easily achieved. But what about CSS? Different versions define the same CSS classes.
[12:27:59] <BillCriswell> Jemt: Eak.
[12:28:10] <Whirl3d> Why load different versions?
[12:28:25] <Jemt> Legacy support and proper support :)
[12:28:46] <Jemt> Some existing code uses older versions of UI - we don't want to be stuck with that
[12:28:57] <Whirl3d> you can't unload the old version and load the new version without it breaking?
[12:29:16] <Jemt> Very unlikely
[12:29:27] <Jemt> This is code we don't want to mess with. It's production code
[12:29:58] <Jemt> I figured there would be some way to achieve this since jQuery allows for multiple versions to co exist
[12:30:19] <BillCriswell> In that case, why do you need the new version?
[12:31:06] <Jemt> To make sure new code is kept up to date. Most likely new features will replace the old once, which is another reason for keeping it running on the old version.
[12:32:35] <Whirl3d> Currently, jquery animate uses string shortcuts like  "show", "hide", "toggle" to take the place of values in the function call..How can I define my own string shortcuts?
[12:32:39] <Jemt> I was hoping the CSS file would all define a version number in their selectors (e.g. ".1103 ul li { .. }")
[12:32:57] <eternyti> exit
[12:33:11] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: var kindOfQuick = 700; ? =)
[12:33:41] <NoiseEee> Jemt: no, and the request seems a bit off. there's no need to move to 'new code' if you're not using new features and it works perfectly fine on the 'old code'
[12:33:48] <NoiseEee> Jemt: save the new jqueryUI for a new page/script/etc
[12:35:02] <Whirl3d> BillCriswell, d'oh!  I don't know why I thought it was doing some sort of magic calculation in the background to come up with a number...that was obvious...thanks..
[12:35:02] <Jemt> 10.000 lines of old code which will live for 2-5 years. And we want to invest more into jQuery UI so obviously we want to make sure all the new features are based on recent versions of UI. How does that not make sense? It makes just as good sense as being able to run multiple versions of jQuery
[12:35:42] <Ziber> How can I bind to the enter key being pressed?
[12:36:16] <NoiseEee> Jemt: " It makes just as good sense as being able to run multiple versions of jQuery"  which is totally senseless and ill-advised
[12:37:47] <Whirl3d> ew the animate queue demonstation on api.jquery.com/animate isn't working...
[12:38:19] <Jemt> NoiseEee: This system allows for plugins. Some people have written their plugins for e.g. jQuery 1.7 while others for 1.10. Why should we force them to rewrite something that works perfectly ?
[12:38:43] <Jemt> We don't want to be stuck with jQuery 1.7
[12:38:48] <Jemt> Or some other old version
[12:39:18] <NoiseEee> Jemt: yeah uh. well no, you can't differentiate between 'old' and 'new' UI css
[12:39:34] <NoiseEee> Jemt: though of course you could rename the file
[12:39:53] <Jemt> Class names would still be identical, causing styles to be overridden
[12:40:55] <Jemt> Perhaps if the most recent stylesheet was backward compatible - then I could just load the most recent. But that's probably not the case.
[12:41:06] <NoiseEee> Jemt: look... loading multiple versions of the same library is a terrible idea, i'm sorry you can't see that, but good luck.
[12:41:20] <NoiseEee> its quite simply 'doing it wrong'
[12:42:12] <Jemt> NoiseEee: I think I've given quite good reasons. noConflict() was introduced for a reason
[12:42:35] <NoiseEee> Jemt: mostly to deal with *other* libraries.
[12:42:43] <Jemt> Yes, correct
[12:43:46] <Jemt> Also, CMS systems should actually implement it this way (supporting multiple versions). That would prevent jQuery features from breaking over and over again, when new versions of the CMS or jQuery is released
[12:44:14] <Ziber> I've figured out how to bind to the enter key but it appears that $(".class").bind('keyup', function); doesn't give me the actual element in which this occured.
[12:44:18] <Ziber> Is that true?
[12:44:31] <Jemt> Being able to target a specific version makes great sense in a plugin environment
[12:46:22] <Ziber> Can I provide parameters for a function that I'm attaching to a .blur() event?
[12:47:43] <NoiseEee> $(".class").bind('keyup', function(e) { var whatWasClicked = e.eventTarget;})
[12:48:25] <Jemt> Ziber: Not sure how it works. But when you pass a closure it "copies" the context in which it runs. So parameters defined in the same namespace will be available to your closure
[12:48:43] <Jemt> Example using native JS: http://jsfiddle.net/KkKP4/
[12:48:54] <Jemt> Notice how "x" is available from your anonymous function
[12:49:13] <Jemt> Ah, wait. Poor example
[12:50:09] <redondo> How do I know that certain element is already loaded (or not)? How can I wait until then? I'm trying $(document).ready(...), but then the wanted element is not yet in the dom. And $(document).load(...) is never triggered.
[12:50:12] <Jemt> http://jsfiddle.net/KkKP4/1/
[12:50:30] <Jemt> redondo: What element?
[12:50:42] <redondo> A text input one
[12:51:01] <redondo> within a div, etc...
[12:51:14] <Jemt> How do you know that your load handler is not fired?
[12:51:25] <Jemt> Remove all the code within and add:  alert(123);
[12:51:29] <Jemt> Does the alert show now?
[12:52:08] <redondo> I'm doing that but instead of alert i'm using console.log("ALERT")... is that ok?
[12:52:46] <Jemt> Sure, if you have your console running
[12:53:06] <Jemt> Does "ALERT" show up in the console?
[12:53:18] <NoiseEee> <input>s dont have load events, as mentioned
[12:53:34] <NoiseEee> redondo: is this thing being loaded at any ol' time?  you have no clue at all?  what is loading it?
[12:53:44] <Jemt> He's not using load on an input field
[12:53:58] <redondo> NoiseEee, now I'm doing over $(document)
[12:54:11] <Jemt> Show us the code - it's easier
[12:54:19] <redondo> Jemt, no, ALERT is never show
[12:54:23] <Jemt> Show us the code - it's easier
[12:54:25] <redondo> I'll try..
[12:54:44] <Jemt> Perhaps use jsfiddle.net to re-produce the problem
[13:05:24] <redondo> Jemt, this is: http://pastebin.com/i6KRNsUF
[13:06:10] <redondo> Jemt, I know, it is ugly.
[13:06:36] <NoiseEee> redondo: your document.ready call is within in another function!
[13:07:13] <redondo> NoiseEee, so?
[13:07:34] <NoiseEee> so, that can't be registered until you call the function
[13:07:40] <NoiseEee> at which point, the document has long since loaded
[13:08:16] <redondo> I'm calling it in line 87, no?
[13:08:29] <NoiseEee> redondo: great, the document has loaded there.  it doesn't load again.
[13:08:43] <redondo> ok
[13:09:03] <NoiseEee> sounds like you should either move what you want called into the existing document.ready function, or use callbacks,.
[13:11:06] <dabar> Does anyone know for a fact that http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ , in the context of an ajax call, is only executed when it completes successfully?
[13:11:24] <dabar> Thus making it exactly equivalent to the 'success' callback?
[13:11:28] <redondo> NoiseEee, sorry, not sure If I get it.
[13:11:32] <Ziber> I have a function called calc_size(input). $("li input").blur(function() { calc_size(this.value); }); only works most of the time... sometimes I get 'undefined'.
[13:11:36] <Ziber> Why would that be?
[13:12:00] <shoky> dabar: yes
[13:12:18] <BillCriswell> Ziber: Impossible to know without being able to see calc_size()
[13:12:32] <BillCriswell> I'm assuming it's being fed a value it shouldn't be.
[13:13:12] <NoiseEee> redondo: the document only loads once. you've specified a function to be called when that happens.  any further additions to your 'document load/ready' call simply won't be run because the document has already loaded.
[13:13:38] <dabar> shoky: thank you
[13:13:41] <Ziber> BillCriswell: http://caton.liber.in/~ziber/calc_size.txt
[13:14:17] <redondo> NoiseEee, greate. How could I know when $('id_text') (coming from the url at line 88) is loaded?
[13:15:09] <BillCriswell> Ziber: I'm guessing it's just hidden the return in the if( input == "" )
[13:15:36] <BillCriswell> just hitting the retrun*
[13:15:42] <BillCriswell> I mess up so many words.
[13:15:44] <shoky> Ziber: bad usage of "this"
[13:15:56] <redondo> NoiseEee, when I call it at at_close function, it is loaded (at 49).
[13:16:04] <shoky> and declare your local variables with "var"
[13:16:50] <NoiseEee> redondo: sorry i can't really follow the script.  look into callbacks.
[13:16:57] <Ziber> shoky: Yeah, I've fixed the "this" problem.
[13:17:13] <redondo> NoiseEee, ok, thanks.
[13:38:40] <Ricaz> Is there a way to animate (ease) content that is moving because something on the page was hidden?
[13:39:23] <Ricaz> Like, I have a box and a button, but the box disappears so the button is moved upwards. So instead of just 'teleporting' it, I want it to slide up.
[13:39:24] <hlve> if you clone, and appendto an item, can you target said cloned item after?
[13:40:07] <hlve> i can't seem to fire off a click function to a cloned element,
[13:42:55] <hlve> harro?
[13:44:09] <Whirl3d> hive, can you make a fiddle to show how you are doing it currently?
[13:45:29] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, you can animation the opacity property to 0 (which will leave the blank space for  the element. Then animate it's height to 0 to make thing slide up
[13:45:52] <Whirl3d> once done, set display:none so it doesn't render
[13:46:21] <Ricaz> Whirl3d, that's a good idea, thanks :)
[13:46:35] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/gLxmF/2/ -- clicking the button opens a new list of available list options. clicking on said list options, clones, and appends said list item to the original list.
[13:46:38] <hlve> as you can see
[13:46:53] <hlve> only the non cloned items on the original list maintain the click function
[13:47:02] <Whirl3d> hive, looking now.
[13:47:43] <Whirl3d> What you need to do at first glance, is to handle the click event on the parent element of the appended item
[13:47:57] <Whirl3d> I'll update the fiddle to show you
[13:48:02] <hlve> thanks
[13:54:32] <Ziber> I have a portion of my document dynamically loaded. I want to make a permanent link that will automatically load a different piece. How can I do that?
[13:56:11] <Ziber> I guess my question more comes down to a .htaccess question...
[13:57:24] <hlve> htaccess question for sure.
[13:57:40] <hlve> Whirl3d, any luck?
[13:57:47] <Whirl3d> hive: http://jsfiddle.net/gLxmF/5/
[13:57:54] <hlve> thanks homie.
[13:58:10] <hlve> woah
[13:58:13] <hlve> what happened here.
[13:58:13] <Ziber> hlve: Did I explain it well enough, at least?
[13:58:13] <hlve> lol
[13:58:19] <Whirl3d> there were a couple of considerations that I had to guess for you. For example, you can't append a <ul> to a <ul>
[13:58:43] <Whirl3d> so I added an extra li to your <ul> and THEN append the new <ul>
[13:58:43] <hlve> you can append an li to a ul though
[13:58:46] <Whirl3d> stuff like that
[13:59:20] <Whirl3d> right, but you were referring to the <ul> in your append,...if you want to append the li's inside you can do that without adding an li
[14:00:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/gLxmF/5/
[14:01:44] <hlve> but the functionality is all off on that.
[14:02:22] <hlve> and I don't understand what you mean by handling the click event on the parent element
[14:02:35] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/gLxmF/6/
[14:03:11] <NoiseEee> hlve: your code says 'hey, do this with all the .list li's currently in the document'
[14:03:20] <Whirl3d> In this one, I placed the "click event handler" on the wrapper element for your list. It allows you to click anything in that list (appended at any time or not) and it will react
[14:03:36] <hlve> Ahh
[14:03:52] <hlve> Let me try this out on my prototype
[14:03:53] <hlve> sec
[14:03:54] <hlve> thanks again btw
[14:04:22] <Whirl3d> So if you click it twice, it will add another set of the same options.. but clicking it follows the same rules
[14:05:55] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[14:06:04] <Whirl3d> I added a context to the click handler. When you use .on("click", function(e) )    that handles the click event on the parent item and all child items.
[14:06:46] <Whirl3d> but adding a context allows you to avoid performing the click action on the parent or any non-matching items....like this: .on("click", "li", function (e) {})
[14:06:55] <Bloomberg> how cn I set that later of a specific object makes something?
[14:06:57] <Bloomberg> can
[14:06:58] <Bloomberg> +
[14:07:14] <Whirl3d> adding the "li" to the on-handler selects only the "li" child elements to listen for click events
[14:07:28] <Bloomberg> For example, I have list with 20 elements, I need that later of the 5° element is another color
[14:07:45] <Whirl3d> the first way I did it, click just off an li made the entire list turn green (cause the list wrapper was clicked)
[14:09:17] <hazardous> hi
[14:09:28] <hazardous> i'm using $.each($.getJSON()), is it possible to make it blocking?
[14:09:38] <hazardous> i need to fire MAXIMAL one ajax request per second, one by one, in order
[14:10:41] <Whirl3d> async:false option on ajax, I guess?
[14:11:21] <NoiseEee> no
[14:11:24] <NoiseEee> terrible idea
[14:11:28] <Whirl3d> or setup an ajax queue object and used the callbacks to call the next one
[14:11:33] <NoiseEee> so is $.each($.getJSON())
[14:11:38] <Spami> Hello
[14:11:40] <Whirl3d> agreed
[14:11:52] <Spami> Is there a way to change the src of an image without using document ?
[14:12:11] <Whirl3d> $("img").attr("src",newsrc);
[14:12:31] <Whirl3d> or more properly $("img").prop("src",newsrc) maybe
[14:12:51] <redondo> NoiseeEee, sorry, one question: this is what you suggest me to look: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[14:12:59] <Spami> ah
[14:13:09] <Spami> thanks Whirl3d
[14:13:49] <Whirl3d> np
[14:14:30] <NoiseEee> redondo: more about the concept.  when X finishes, do Y.
[14:15:15] <redondo> NoiseEee, is 'when' a keyword?
[14:17:31] <hazardous> Whirl3d: any idea on how to implement the queue thing?
[14:17:36] <hazardous> i've never really dealt with that (or used jquery much before)
[14:18:08] <Fenikkusu> Is there any preferred/reason/whatever to using $.fn.construct = function() { ... methods.myMethod.apply(this, argumenets) ...}; and $.fn.construct = function() {...$(this).data('myObject', new $.myObject) ...}
[14:18:29] <Fenikkusu> I've seen both and not sure which is preferred/better, etc
[14:18:53] <Fenikkusu> new $.myObject(this) **
[14:28:14] <sayd> anyone using jquery-validation know how to make a remote: rule run only if field is required?
[14:31:16] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/obAYEQU/1/
[14:31:31] <Bloomberg> How can I set all the element in red later of 3 element
[14:34:57] <Whirl3d> I thought that the blur event target attribute was the new focused element...what is the new focused element in a blur event?
[14:35:06] <grafi> Bloomberg http://jsbin.com/obAYEQU/2/
[14:36:21] <sayd> Whirl3d: I think the event will be complete by the time the new element has focus
[14:36:45] <sayd> so you'd have to handle your logic in the focus event of the element you're targeting

[14:38:27] <biscuit> hey guys, I'm trying to understand whats going on with my website. there seems to be a bunch of space at the bottom that I'm trying to get rid of
[14:38:52] <biscuit> and resizing my main div doesn't seem to be helping
[14:39:12] <grafi> break out your inspector and inspect oô
[14:40:00] <Whirl3d> how weird that the jquery event relatedTarget property doesn't contain the new focused element..
[14:40:38] <sayd> anyone using jquery-validation have an idea about https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/882

[14:41:33] <Ziber> I have ResourceFallback in my .htaccess now, pointing at my main HTML doc with JS handling the URIs. If it's a URI that isn't / but isn't handled by anything else, I want the user to be forwarded to foobar.com/. I tried window.location.href = "foobar.com/", but this gets caught in an endless loop. Any thoughts?
[14:43:06] <biscuit> grafi: I can't seem to see whats up. inspector says the body and html elements are blocked as they're supposed to be, it just doesn't add up to me
[14:43:22] <grafi> have a link?
[14:44:25] <biscuit> take a gander http://ircur.com/#/home
[14:48:55] <javalover> how do you stop page from jumping after appending html?
[14:49:12] <javalover> like say i scroll to bottom of page, and then i load more of page
[14:49:22] <javalover> sometimes it jumps, how to stop this?
[14:49:50] <Bloomberg> grafi: still are you there?
[14:50:27] <Bloomberg> http://i.imgur.com/2XEr8ys.png
[14:50:27] <biscuit> I think I broke him with my question
[14:50:31] <Bloomberg> This is my problem
[14:50:38] <Bloomberg> I'm working with fullcalendar plugin
[14:50:57] <Bloomberg> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[14:50:58] <Bloomberg> this
[14:51:03] <grafi> biscuit I think I know whats wrong :P
[14:51:39] <Bloomberg> I need only in each one day box show me max 4 task
[14:51:53] <biscuit> hehe, well I've been stumped for some time on it
[14:52:28] <grafi> biscuit did you know that visibility hidden causes an element to be transparent
[14:52:42] <grafi> but the element still takes up space in to flow of the page?
[14:52:57] <biscuit> oh, no kidding?
[14:52:58] <grafi> well apparently you didnt know that :P
[14:53:03] <grafi> thats the problem
[14:53:11] <Bloomberg> what can I do for to fix that?
[14:53:12] <biscuit> ahhhh that makes sense
[14:53:41] <grafi> all your hidden content, is bigger than the content displayed once you set that to e.g. display: none the space on the bottom will disappear
[14:54:13] <Bloomberg> The yellow boxes is ok
[14:54:16] <Bloomberg> are ok*
[14:54:19] <grafi> Bloomberg, oh that again
[14:54:33] <biscuit> alrighty, I'll give it a shot grafi, thanks mate
[14:54:39] <grafi> yw
[14:54:43] <Bloomberg> Is that I have been tested many times but I don't get it
[14:55:17] <grafi> do the orange boxes all belong to the same day?
[14:55:17] <grafi> oô
[14:56:52] <platzhirsch> I have a series of <td> elements with values inside, I would like to wrap these values with an anchor-tag, what would be the best approach? I can only think of something like $(selector).html( $("<a>",  { href: ... }).append($(selector).html()) )
[14:57:43] <Bloomberg> yes
[14:58:09] <Bloomberg> grafi: I need if there are more than 4 orange boxes the rest doesn't beign shown
[14:58:14] <grafi> but what about the "hide everything after 3" css ?
[14:58:19] <grafi> didnt work?
[14:59:31] <grafi> platzhirsch look at .wrap() ?
[14:59:55] <platzhirsch> grafi: perfect, thanks for pointing out!
[15:00:04] <grafi> no problemo
[15:19:01] <javalover> lol ok now I think I really solved it
[15:19:21] <javalover> my loading flag was in the wrong place, so it was saying "i loaded" from the loaded html, not from the end of the function that appends the html
[15:19:22] <javalover> gg
[15:21:05] <javalover> nope still doing it
[15:21:07] <javalover> super annoying!!
[15:35:32] <Whirl3d> javalover, where you at? got a fiddle setup?
[15:35:47] <Whirl3d> or better yet, a jsbin?
[15:38:53] <javalover> Whirl thank god
[15:39:04] <javalover> it's very simple code, all it does is this
[15:39:10] <javalover> i scroll to bottom, it grabs new html & appends
[15:39:23] <javalover> now as the feed gets to be huge, it starts to jump
[15:39:45] <javalover> i have no idea what is causing the jump, asthe first like 20 loads it's fine...
[15:40:01] <javalover> i've gone over the function everything is isolated & yet still jumping idk
[15:40:56] <Whirl3d> perhaps you need to set the height of the scrolable container to some outrageous height before appending elements
[15:41:04] <javalover> perhaps
[15:41:20] <Whirl3d> then, there won't be any jump when you append content because the container already is bigger than the content
[15:42:19] <Whirl3d> it likely starts to jump once your new content is bigger than the original scrolling container...suddenly, the proportional track button has to adjust it's position and size...causing the jump
[15:44:57] <Whirl3d> Perhaps a better way to handle it is to not use the default scrolling methods (except for fallback) and instead hae a scrolldown button that animates the position of the "scrollable" element...then you  don't have to worry about the resize issues.
[15:50:10] <Ericx2x> how difficult is it to mouse over text and show an image?
[15:50:42] <Whirl3d> if you are blind, impossible
[15:50:56] <grafi> didnt see that comming
[15:50:58] <grafi> ...
[15:51:00] <grafi> hahah
[15:51:00] <grafi> xD
[15:51:19] <Whirl3d> I say that because there is a lot of extra considerations to answer your question. Can you give more details?
[15:51:28] <Whirl3d> ;)
[15:51:43] <grafi> well the answer is probably not difficult at all
[15:51:47] <Whirl3d> didn't "see" that coming...gone one. 8)
[15:51:49] <grafi> 80:20 rule and so on
[15:53:47] <Whirl3d> I am trying to figure out a more elegant way to set up a comparison library where I have a series of functions that returns 1 of 3 possible values when applied to element. I am making a jsbin example to illustrate. .brb

[16:02:42] <javalover> kk lemme know
[16:11:25] <javalover> SHOKY!!!
[16:15:54] <javalover> upon further inspection, it JUMPS first then it appends
[16:16:34] <YammYcoding> hi. I put a $.post( "index.php", { hashtag: query[1] } ); inside document ready, but after the var hashtag doesn't exist. Any idea? I'm trying to pass the hash as a post var for php see
[16:16:55] <javalover> yes
[16:17:12] <javalover> are you calling $_POST['hashtag'] ?
[16:17:17] <hlve> shoky is a javascript wizard
[16:17:24] <javalover> he's my hero haha
[16:17:25] <YammYcoding> how i do this from js ?
[16:17:37] <YammYcoding> i want to alert it
[16:17:39] <javalover> no that's on the php end
[16:17:47] <YammYcoding> js can't see a post var?
[16:17:52] <javalover> nope
[16:17:54] <javalover> it's sending it
[16:18:00] <javalover> it's like this in the end
[16:18:17] <javalover> mywebsite.com/?hashtag=query[1]
[16:18:32] <javalover> it's just nicer & not viewable in browser by user
[16:18:34] <YammYcoding> $tag = $_POST['hashtag']; var_dump($tag);  this prints null
[16:18:44] <javalover> hmmmm
[16:18:50] <javalover> and that's on your index.php?
[16:18:58] <javalover> try something simple just to make sure
[16:19:04] <javalover> try hashtag:"hello world"
[16:19:07] <YammYcoding> query[1] is another var with a value inside (striped the # from name)
[16:19:18] <javalover> i know just try something simple
[16:19:24] <javalover> just to make sure it's not you & it's the variable
[16:19:44] <javalover> in general when bug fixing I like to use their own examples just to make sure
[16:19:51] <javalover> they're always right and i'm always wrong lol
[16:20:30] <YammYcoding> $.post( "index.php", { hashtag: 'helo' } );  php prints null :(
[16:20:47] <javalover> bingo
[16:20:56] <javalover> so now what I would do is go here
[16:21:23] <javalover> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:21:29] <javalover> run there exact example
[16:21:35] <YammYcoding> bingo?
[16:21:37] <javalover> and see if you can get there output which is layed out for you
[16:21:43] <javalover> it's you, it's not the code
[16:21:50] <javalover> you're doing something wrong, use there example to see how it's done
[16:22:33] <javalover> here try this
[16:22:34] <javalover> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" })
[16:22:34] <javalover> .done(function(data) {
[16:22:34] <javalover> alert("Data Loaded: " + data);
[16:22:34] <javalover> });
[16:22:38] <javalover> ARGHHHH
[16:23:01] <javalover> ahem try this:    $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" }) done(function(data) { alert("Data Loaded: " + data); });
[16:23:18] <Whirl3d> Ouch...hanging up my cap
[16:23:32] <javalover> it's on there underneath the examples you should see it
[16:24:18] <YammYcoding> oh it errors: .done not know method ><
[16:24:27] <javalover> ummm
[16:24:43] <YammYcoding> ah jq was 1.3 passing to 1.5 let's see
[16:25:12] <javalover> yeah jquery.noconflict
[16:25:20] <javalover> that's a huge one to look for
[16:25:45] <javalover> Whirl wish I could help :-)
[16:26:22] <YammYcoding> oh the test one prints lots of things Oo
[16:26:28] <YammYcoding> mine, nothing
[16:27:40] <YammYcoding> but i tried print the var name in php, and null too
[16:28:05] <YammYcoding> i'm calling it on page load. can i even use the $.post for that?
[16:28:18] <javalover> if you can get the test to work
[16:28:20] <YammYcoding> there is no form like\ or anything
[16:28:23] <javalover> that will show you what is wrong with yours
[16:28:25] <javalover> that's the whole point
[16:28:35] <YammYcoding> but the test var didn't print in php either
[16:28:38] <YammYcoding> both are null
[16:28:51] <javalover> pastebin me?
[16:28:58] <YammYcoding> this $.post goes from behind?
[16:29:08] <YammYcoding> or does it repost the page?
[16:29:16] <javalover> it's an ajax call
[16:29:17] <javalover> simplified
[16:29:26] <javalover> it pasts to a new page
[16:29:35] <javalover> wait are you checking php on your same page?!?!
[16:29:36] <YammYcoding> but it does the request without interfering with the current url?
[16:29:42] <javalover> exactly
[16:29:48] <YammYcoding> yes same page
[16:29:51] <YammYcoding> like index.php
[16:29:51] <javalover> ugh
[16:29:55] <javalover> okay
[16:30:00] <javalover> i know why it's not working
[16:30:03] <YammYcoding> why?
[16:30:06] <javalover> first, create a new page
[16:30:11] <javalover> title it properly & save it
[16:30:20] <javalover> and upload that to your server & try with the new page
[16:30:31] <YammYcoding> but what goes in the new page file?
[16:30:32] <javalover> of course you won't be able to see the var
[16:30:40] <javalover> okay i'll just explain it's fine
[16:30:53] <javalover> php runs on your server, it then sends everything back to you for jquery
[16:31:14] <javalover> so Server -> PHP   then returns to client the info & Client-> Jquery/html etc.
[16:31:30] <javalover> when you call $.post()  you're sending that post to the server
[16:31:43] <javalover> it runs it on server, but it doesn't refresh your current page, it runs it as a post
[16:31:43] <YammYcoding> right
[16:31:46] <javalover> you will never see the post
[16:31:59] <javalover> you can do a mysql insert & that might work
[16:32:08] <javalover> but i recommend still using 2 sepereate documents for .post
[16:32:09] <YammYcoding> ah it's like i'm sending a form with fields, so the php can see the vars?
[16:32:16] <javalover> yeah on the server
[16:32:19] <javalover> but you as the client won't see it
[16:32:23] <YammYcoding> so i'm kind of tricking the php?
[16:32:26] <petey> Hi everyone, if you had 3 different layers (background, div sliding element, top transparent circle) I'd like for the div to slide *out* of the transparent circle to the left, can anyone point me in the right direction?
[16:32:30] <javalover> no you're tricking yourself
[16:32:40] <YammYcoding> can it be an empty php file then?
[16:32:43] <javalover> you're saying this with .post
[16:32:46] <javalover> "HEY SERVER, DO THIS"
[16:32:50] <javalover> and then you're going "why can't I see that?"
[16:33:23] <javalover> if I were you, i'd make a php file that echos the variable
[16:33:31] <javalover> then I would check the data returned from .post
[16:33:33] <javalover> so this one...
[16:33:48] <javalover> $.post("test.php", { "func": "getNameAndTime" },
[16:33:48] <javalover> function(data){
[16:33:48] <javalover> console.log(data.name); // John
[16:33:48] <javalover> console.log(data.time); // 2pm
[16:33:49] <javalover> }, "json");
[16:33:50] <YammYcoding> but the variable is the #hash name
[16:33:56] <javalover> but i wouldn't do a function
[16:34:01] <javalover> i would just alert(data)
[16:34:01] <YammYcoding> that i'm passing from index.php#hash to php
[16:34:10] <javalover> if you alert(data) on a .post, it will show everything echo'd
[16:34:31] <javalover> so for php i'd do <?php  echo $_POST['func']; ?>
[16:34:36] <javalover> and i would save that as test.php
[16:35:44] <javalover> then just change your jquery to be $.post("test.php", { func : "hello world" },function(data){ alert(data);});
[16:35:58] <YammYcoding> aah that's why the alert(data) printed all index content
[16:36:04] <javalover> yeah
[16:36:08] <javalover> it prints everything on the page
[16:36:16] <javalover> because that's what gets returned
[16:36:28] <javalover> but in general it seems like something you're gonna send to server & have php handle
[16:36:35] <javalover> and all client will ever want to know is if it was a success
[16:36:39] <javalover> in which case, you can use the following
[16:36:59] <YammYcoding> hmm i just made it, put a print $_POST['name'] in a ajaxpost.php and it printed 'John'
[16:37:14] <YammYcoding> but how my index.php will see this var then?
[16:37:28] <javalover> var jqxhr = $.post("example.php", function() {
[16:37:28] <javalover> alert("success");
[16:37:28] <javalover> })
[16:37:28] <javalover> .done(function() { alert("second success"); })
[16:37:28] <javalover> .fail(function() { alert("error"); })
[16:37:28] <javalover> .always(function() { alert("finished"); });
[16:37:29] <javalover> // perform other work here ...
[16:37:29] <javalover> // Set another completion function for the request above
[16:37:30] <javalover> jqxhr.always(function(){ alert("second finished"); });
[16:37:45] <javalover> it won't
[16:37:50] <javalover> you're doing things wroong
[16:38:01] <javalover> once it's gone from server to client
[16:38:05] <javalover> you no longer have access to php
[16:38:14] <javalover> now you can reload things
[16:38:26] <YammYcoding> it's that the php can't see the index.php#foo  hashtag part, i'm trying with js
[16:38:28] <javalover> like in my code I use .get  & then I change my existing jquery with the php returned
[16:39:01] <javalover> you have to just understand, Server->PHP  Client->jquery,html etc.
[16:39:13] <javalover> you can call php & ask for a response, and use that response to change things
[16:39:26] <javalover> but your call should be to something small
[16:39:36] <javalover> and specific
[16:40:02] <YammYcoding> wait. like. I was trying to send the #hash name to php, this is the page name, so it might change along the menus.
[16:40:25] <javalover> i'm not sure what it is you're trying to accomplish
[16:40:31] <javalover> but to alter an existing page i'd just use jquery
[16:40:35] <tw2113> confuse you javalover
[16:40:37] <YammYcoding> can be #home #me #contact.  i need that name to tell php to change content.
[16:40:40] <tw2113> i thinky YammYcoding may be succeeding
[16:40:42] <javalover> no i'm just trying to help
[16:41:00] <javalover> okay so then
[16:41:12] <javalover> lets start there
[16:41:15] <javalover> how does that change content?
[16:41:20] <javalover> say i do this yoursite.com#home
[16:41:23] <javalover> what happens in php?
[16:41:24] <YammYcoding> calm down. breath.
[16:41:33] <YammYcoding> you're getting me nervours
[16:41:38] <javalover> lol
[16:41:47] <YammYcoding> 1 2 3 breaaathh innn
[16:42:07] <YammYcoding> my site is index.php#home  , index.php#anypage.
[16:42:16] <YammYcoding> i need to see this hash name to tell php what to display.
[16:42:23] <YammYcoding> this sayd, i put this value in js variable.
[16:42:37] <javalover> so you have a loader issue
[16:42:39] <YammYcoding> then i'm trying to pass it to php down there in index.php
[16:42:48] <javalover> you could try this
[16:42:52] <javalover> it's a bit risky but
[16:43:03] <javalover> try .load() on the page itself
[16:43:17] <javalover> this will essentially reset your entire page & display the new one
[16:43:26] <javalover> so all variables you have on your existing page will be lost but it would work
[16:43:42] <javalover> of course idk why you're doing this...when you could just link yourself to a new page use ahref
[16:43:45] <YammYcoding> no like.
[16:43:57] <javalover> well if you're doing it to your existing page but want to keep your variables
[16:44:02] <javalover> i would create a div that holds your page
[16:44:06] <javalover> and do .load on the div
[16:44:17] <YammYcoding> if is #home , in index.php will be include(home.php)
[16:44:24] <YammYcoding> if is contact, include(contact.php)
[16:44:26] <YammYcoding> get it?
[16:44:34] <javalover> yeah that would work with .load
[16:44:48] <javalover> but i think your order of things is off
[16:45:13] <javalover> if you think more in line with "these php variables are going to be gone and i'll be left with jquery" you'll see a better layout
[16:45:28] <javalover> for my page, i use a div that I load all content into
[16:45:49] <javalover> so if I want fresh new php page, I call mydiv.load("events.php");
[16:46:19] <javalover> and it just resets the div to display properly,  I can also use .get combined with .append, if i just want to add to the existing page
[16:47:00] <javalover> when you call alert(data) and see the php page, that's essentially grabbing your premade html, and you can go append(data)  to add it to an existing object
[16:47:15] <YammYcoding> hmm even if we do this .load, i still need to know at what #hash the url is, in order to know what to open
[16:47:27] <javalover> well yeah but that's the same way
[16:47:37] <javalover> it's just, instead of you asking to reload your existing page
[16:47:52] <javalover> you're telling it , load the new content here using my existing hash variable
[16:47:59] <YammYcoding> oh crap the light is gone
[16:48:20] <YammYcoding> at that hour and alone home it awfull :/
[16:48:35] <javalover> am I being trolled?
[16:48:43] <YammYcoding> no, my light power is gone
[16:48:51] <javalover> sucks
[16:48:54] <YammYcoding> very
[16:49:07] <YammYcoding> i have several windows opened, this sux
[16:49:16] <javalover> on a laptop?
[16:49:21] <YammYcoding> desktop
[16:49:24] <javalover> how!?
[16:49:27] <javalover> no power and it works!?
[16:49:29] <YammYcoding> the nobreak won't handle too much
[16:49:43] <YammYcoding> nobreak here
[16:50:04] <YammYcoding> the light vanishes every week in here. it's awfull
[16:50:12] <javalover> where do you live!?
[16:50:48] <YammYcoding> on the top of a damm high mountain on a crappy neighbourhood
[16:51:14] <javalover> well that sucks
[16:51:15] <YammYcoding> here is so high that to go down on foot i take 20 minutes
[16:51:49] <javalover> anyways i'd fix your structural design
[16:52:05] <javalover> if you want to keep data & also load, you need a place to load to
[16:52:06] <YammYcoding> crap 9pm the light guys won't show up i'm screwed. without light until tomorrow
[16:52:30] <YammYcoding> well now i can't see the other monitor where all the thing was
[16:52:38] <YammYcoding> can i call you when the light gets back?
[16:52:43] <javalover> wtf
[16:53:00] <javalover> feel free to join jquery anytime
[16:53:15] <YammYcoding> thank you javalover i'll think more about the .load meanwhile
[16:53:32] <javalover> just remember, SERVER-PHP, CLIENT->JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY
[16:54:05] <YammYcoding> okey. i will shut the computter off, the nobreak is yelling
[17:12:07] * KaitoKid is away: I'm busy
[17:21:51] <javalover> okay I found out what causes my code to break
[17:22:19] <javalover> it's if I try to append immediately after i appended,   something to do with the element it thinks is last child element
[17:22:52] <javalover> so it causes it to snap back to where that child element was as it thinks that's where I appended, so now all i need is a wait function that makes sure everything is appended first!!
[17:23:14] <javalover> the bug was caused by me endless scrolling as fast as possible :-)
[17:41:31] <petey> can anyone tell me why jquery is being mean to me? http://jsbin.com/IlIRife/1/edit
[17:41:50] <petey> i would like something to pop up from behind #hamburger_menu but instead, #jason is what slides in and out
[17:43:38] <snover> twss
[17:43:48] <petey> How does it choose to randomly select that object?
[17:43:57] <snover> cc danheberden
[17:49:16] <mg983> Can someone help me out, I am trying to have multiple jCarousel Lite instances on a single page … the way I created it it looks like the buttons control both carousels, I want them to only control their respective carousels… http://jsfiddle.net/R2ESU/  Thanks
[17:54:09] <mdev> so I have a jquery post something to my php, the function it calls takes awhile, so I tried to echo before calling the function, hoping that'd make the jquery happy so it can display the text
[17:54:16] <mdev> but it blocks until the function call is done....
[17:54:21] <mdev> anyway to get around that?
[17:57:27] <petey> hey mdev
[17:57:35] <petey> maybe i would try not using $(this)
[17:57:57] <petey> previous/next doesnt work either lol
[17:58:41] <aquaone> i haven't used jCarouselLite but i know jCarousel doesn't have this, hmm
[17:58:49] <petey> i think what the .find is doing
[17:58:53] <petey> is searching the whole document
[17:58:58] <petey> can you set a container to look for
[17:59:00] <petey> in this case c-1
[18:03:18] <aquaone> even if you define independent selectors, separate invocations, same control affects all. you may need to switch to a different carousel.
[18:10:09] <mdev> anyway to pass
[18:10:18] <mdev> 1 second
[18:11:36] <mdev> http://pastebin.com/pf85hiPE
[18:11:52] <mdev> how can I pass the info,info2,info3 params to my callback
[18:11:57] <mdev> after the post returns?
[18:16:59] <fl0w> I'm trying to create a FormData XHR2 POST send, and while initialising the object, like so: var fd = new FormData($('#id_of_file_input')[0]) - I'm not getting the file. Do I have the selector wrong? Because it doesn't return an object (when I console.log it), it shows me the text-representation of the field?
[18:31:28] <YammYcoding> i'm baaack
[18:31:41] <YammYcoding> javalover o/
[18:51:50] <mehwork> how do you append something to the <head> if, and only if, it doesn't already exist but it doesn't have an ID or class beause it's a script tag?
[18:52:23] <danheberden> script tags can have ids
[18:52:46] <danheberden> you can also see if any other script tags with the same src attr exist
[18:55:33] <tw2113> ltns danheberden
[18:56:12] <mehwork> hmm
[19:03:11] <mehwork> danheberden: i'm having an issue where a getScript is getting some script but it evals it instead of adding it to the dom and it's google analytics code so google is saying my ga code isn't installed
[19:03:22] <mehwork> but stackoverflow said that it should work
[19:05:16] <YammYcoding> javalover there?
[19:06:04] <YammYcoding> so. using hastag to identify current page is wrong way of using it?
[19:08:20] <YammYcoding> i'm thinking of it, and i guess i will drop this idea and change all back to get vars in url :/
[19:09:07] <YammYcoding> any opinion about it?
[19:09:08] <doug65536> YammYcoding: hash tag usually identifies a place in the page
[19:09:29] <doug65536> YammYcoding: but it should work the way you are doing it. what isn't working
[19:10:05] <YammYcoding> i thought that using like index.php#home  was prettier, but well, i can't have php to see it :/
[19:10:59] <doug65536> index.php/home?
[19:11:02] <YammYcoding> i wanted to get the #foo , in order to tell php which page it will include.
[19:11:07] <YammYcoding> no #home
[19:11:26] <YammYcoding> like if ( #home ) include ( 'home.php' );
[19:11:37] <doug65536> yes but server won't see that as you say. but server can see index.php/home
[19:11:38] <YammYcoding> if ( #mail ) include ('contact.php' ). etc
[19:12:16] <YammYcoding> the content must be included inside index.php, so i can't point to /foo
[19:12:44] <doug65536> YammYcoding: I'm pretty sure you can do that
[19:12:45] <YammYcoding> i could get the ajax thing to pass this value to another php
[19:13:31] <YammYcoding> i $.post the #foo name ( 'foo' ) into a ajaxpost.php that will print it back as $_POST['foo'];
[19:13:37] <YammYcoding> now how i tell php to read it?
[19:14:35] <doug65536> YammYcoding: trust me, /stuff can be after your php file
[19:14:50] <doug65536> YammYcoding: did you even try it?
[19:15:15] <YammYcoding> if i say it's index.php/foo it won't find this folder
[19:15:59] <doug65536> YammYcoding: you're wrong
[19:16:12] <YammYcoding> i don't get it. how so?
[19:16:18] <doug65536> YammYcoding: it will find the file and stop looking
[19:16:45] <doug65536> try it
[19:16:57] <YammYcoding> and it will open the file alone, outside the index.php.
[19:17:16] <YammYcoding> imagine a header and a menu, and to the right, the content that is the only changing thing.
[19:17:20] <doug65536> YammYcoding: go in your browser and put /itcantwork after your /index.php. see what happens
[19:17:24] <YammYcoding> i change this content only
[19:18:31] <YammYcoding> hm id did read the index.php with no css, no images
[19:23:00] <mehwork> inside of a jquery callback when you do things like "success: foo()" is it possible to add more than one function/expression like "success: if (bla) { foo(); bar(); }" ?
[19:23:14] <mehwork> the semicolon ususally breaks things for me
[19:23:21] <doug65536> mehwork: success: foo() doesn't make sense
[19:23:33] <mehwork> i guess i could make another function and put it all in tehre and just call that one function
[19:23:39] <doug65536> mehwork: success: foo would make sense
[19:23:53] <mehwork> sorry that was just psuedo code
[19:24:14] <mehwork> though i don't see why that makes more sense if you can do things like: success: foo(result)
[19:24:35] <doug65536> mehwork: what?
[19:24:47] <doug65536> mehwork: foo() CALLS foo and assigns its return value to success
[19:25:30] <doug65536> mehwork: and no, you can't do things like foo(result)
[19:25:34] <mehwork> hmm
[19:26:21] <doug65536> success: function(data,status,xhr) { ... }
[19:26:58] <mehwork> ah right, agains p-code.  i've been doing stuff like: success: $('foo'.append(result)
[19:27:15] <mehwork> minus the typos
[19:27:27] <mehwork> thanks
[19:27:34] <doug65536> mehwork: what?
[19:27:59] <doug65536> mehwork: you may have been doing that but it crashes. where does "result" come from?
[19:28:33] <doug65536> mehwork: meaning, a result variable won't materialize because some code is after "success:"
[19:28:39] <mehwork> e.g. $.getScript(path, function(result) { success: $('foo').append(result) }
[19:28:55] <doug65536> yes, an anonymous function like that would work
[19:29:49] <doug65536> mehwork: but if you didn't want to inline it like that, passing just the name of the function there (without parentheses) would work too
[19:30:10] <mehwork> so going back to my original question, to have more statements in the success call, do i wrap in like: $.getScript(path, function(result) { success: function(result) { if ($('whatever')) { $('foo').append(result); anotherFunction(); }
[19:30:37] <doug65536> mehwork: if you want success: you have to use $.ajax
[19:30:59] <doug65536> mehwork: $.getScript is just a wrapper that calls $.ajax for you
[19:31:06] <mehwork> getScript has a success: according to the docs
[19:31:15] <mehwork> oh wait
[19:31:21] <mehwork> $.get i mean
[19:31:36] <doug65536> no, it doesn't
[19:31:38] <mehwork> which i can use instead
[19:31:51] <mehwork> it's working for me though weird
[19:31:55] <doug65536> "success" is a function
[19:32:02] <doug65536> look closer at the docs
[19:32:14] <doug65536> under the blue heading where it tells you the parameter types
[19:33:14] <doug65536> then look at $.ajax, under settings. it is an object. which has a success property
[19:34:22] <mehwork> i wonder why it does something though
[19:35:14] <doug65536> js> (function() { success: function() {} })
[19:35:22] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[19:35:32] <doug65536> it crashes
[19:36:16] <mehwork> i see, so i should just take out the success and use the entire body as a callback
[19:36:17] <doug65536> because the success: line is nonsense in js
[19:36:35] <doug65536> yes that is already the success callback
[19:36:40] <mehwork> thanks
[19:37:17] <doug65536> $.getScript(path, function(result) { if ($('whatever')) { $('foo').append(result); anotherFunction(); } });    <-- this must be what you meant
[19:37:26] <mehwork> yeah
[19:37:32] <mehwork> exactly, i totally confused myself
[19:38:43] <doug65536> mehwork: things in jquery become less confusing when you learn which functions are really just wrappers that call something else that actually does the work
[19:39:39] <doug65536> mehwork: in this case, $.getScript is just a 'helper' that calls $.ajax for you, taking your parameters and building an 'options' object for you then calling $.ajax
[19:43:00] <mehwork> i see
[19:43:50] <mehwork> any idea why console.log($('script').attr('src')) is only printing the first result and not all of the scripts?
[19:45:26] <YammYcoding> guys this works?    $.post( "ajaxpost.php?hashtag=" + query[1], {} );
[19:45:40] <YammYcoding> i put a line to create a session variable in there, but nada :/
[19:47:38] <_rgn> mehwork: because well .attr('src') obviously doesn't perform itself on all of them
[19:47:45] <_rgn> only the first
[19:48:34] <mehwork> _rgn how can i make it do it on all
[19:49:32] <_rgn> you'd have to do $('script').map(function() { return this.src })
[19:52:06] <doug65536> YammYcoding: you are looking in $_GET['hashtag'] right?
[19:53:25] <YammYcoding> yes. running this alone, i print the get var and it works. but the session in php get not created :/ I guess i'm overcomplicating it. I guess i'd have to accept this is impossible and use the normal get vars like everyone else :/
[19:54:30] <doug65536> YammYcoding: ?hashtag=  is a "normal get var like everyone else"
[19:54:32] <tw2113> could be possible that everyone else does it that way because it actually works
[19:54:49] <javalover> ^^
[19:54:55] <YammYcoding> yaa but i was trying to do #hashtag :(
[19:55:03] <YammYcoding> seems that js don't talk to php :p
[19:55:14] <YammYcoding> in anypossible way :p
[19:55:28] <javalover> I have a simple question if anyone wants to answer it
[19:55:45] <tw2113> it does
[19:55:48] <javalover> how can I check to see that my .append() has fully loaded
[19:55:54] <tw2113> you just don't know how to decifer between
[19:56:06] <YammYcoding> you're mocking me isn't it :)
[19:56:21] <tw2113> if you want to define me that way, go for it
[19:56:22] <YammYcoding> i'm trying for hours several ways, js is tough hehe
[19:56:42] <tw2113> yes, sometimes coding isn't a walk in the park
[19:57:15] <doug65536> YammYcoding: you could set a cookie, that would be sent
[19:57:50] <YammYcoding> a cookie was the first attempt. but whenever i cliked any other link in menu, the page wouldn't reload and the cookie would not change
[19:57:53] <doug65536> YammYcoding: if you are trying to avoid "crap" at the end of the url
[19:58:14] <YammYcoding> i was trying to let it smaller with #foo
[19:58:24] <YammYcoding> instead of ?var=foo
[20:00:04] <tw2113> i'd probably end up plucking off the text after the #, shove it in an array that i send as json to the server, then decode and grab from there
[20:00:22] <tw2113> no guarantee that idea is most efficient, but i think it'd work
[20:00:53] <javalover> doug: SOMETIMES!?!?
[20:01:17] <YammYcoding> hmm json.. maybe, but it would end up hitting the page not reloading anymore wall
[20:01:32] <tw2113> would it?
[20:01:51] <YammYcoding> it happens with the jquery load, it'd happen with json the same
[20:01:56] <YammYcoding> click another link and nothing changes
[20:03:05] <javalover> ugh can anyone help me for once?
[20:03:18] <YammYcoding> with what javalover?
[20:03:29] <javalover> how do you know if .append is fully loaded?
[20:04:05] <Ziber> So, my JS dies somewhere, but devtools in Chrome just points to JQuery. How can I find where my issue is?
[20:04:07] <YammYcoding> there might have a success in it?
[20:05:08] <YammYcoding> Ziber i would try putting some breakpoints like a B-tree
[20:05:34] <Ziber> B-tree...?
[20:05:37] <YammYcoding> you'd supposed to find the thing in few steps
[20:05:54] <YammYcoding> that search concept for database
[20:06:29] <YammYcoding> divide in half test each side, divide the suspect side in half test each side.
[20:06:37] <YammYcoding> might find it in 5 steps :)
[20:07:09] <Ziber> Yes, but how should I cut it? Just throwing return statements in?
[20:07:26] <YammYcoding> you can add breakpoints within browser
[20:07:34] <Ziber> I've yet to figure out how to do that.
[20:07:35] <doug65536> Ziber: look at call stack
[20:07:37] <YammYcoding> at first line then half.
[20:07:47] <Ziber> Especially since the page freezes and stuff...
[20:07:59] <YammYcoding> if passes the half, put into half of second half. test.
[20:08:17] <doug65536> javalover: "append" is finished when it returns. what do you mean "fully loaded". you mean elements that it appended are loaded?
[20:08:28] <YammYcoding> i guess he's appending hell lot of things
[20:08:34] <YammYcoding> and need to know when it ends
[20:08:47] <Ziber> YammYcoding: I understand binary searching. I'm just not sure what to do since devtools freezes...
[20:09:10] <doug65536> Ziber: it freezes because chrome is buggy and has memory corruption bugs...
[20:09:11] <YammYcoding> try firefox/chrome
[20:09:17] <doug65536> Ziber: close the tab and start over
[20:09:27] <YammYcoding> i like firefox more for debuging
[20:09:48] <javalover> i found a plugin
[20:09:51] <doug65536> Ziber: also, chrome is way too dumb to handle infinite loops
[20:09:52] <javalover> you kids are lazy
[20:10:11] <tw2113> not often i see people bashing chrome in here
[20:10:37] <doug65536> tw2113: it's not bashing when it is the truth
[20:10:56] <doug65536> tw2113: everything has bugs
[20:11:04] * tw2113 prefers Firefox anyway
[20:12:55] <doug65536> YammYcoding: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/BnsV9/
[20:13:26] <doug65536> YammYcoding: to see that it doesn't affect address bar http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/BnsV9/show/
[20:13:56] <doug65536> YammYcoding: in my example, php would check $_COOKIE['page']
[20:14:26] <YammYcoding> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[20:14:38] <doug65536> YammYcoding: yes that's jsfiddle being cute
[20:14:41] <doug65536> YammYcoding: try http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/BnsV9/show/
[20:19:16] <ezrios> YammYcoding: I think that is binary search, not a B-tree.
[20:19:16] <YammYcoding> href = . ?
[20:19:28] <doug65536> YammYcoding: means load this page again
[20:19:38] <YammYcoding> ah i remember there was a tree in the name :)
[20:19:46] <ezrios> maybe binary search tree
[20:20:01] <YammYcoding> b don't stand for binary?
[20:20:16] <ezrios> well B-trees and BSTs are different
[20:20:23] <ezrios> I think the former is more general
[20:20:24] <doug65536> b-tree means a tree with multiple keys in each node
[20:21:06] <doug65536> b+ tree means a b-tree but there are links to walk the nodes in order
[20:21:19] <YammYcoding> hmm ya i might be confusing them, i saw that 11 years ago :)
[20:22:13] <doug65536> I mean, to walk the leaves in order
[20:22:35] <YammYcoding> what i remember was for searching fast in few steps.
[20:23:24] <doug65536> b-tree is a locality optimization, primarily meant to reduce seeks when reading from disk.
[20:24:01] <doug65536> you definitely wouldn't want to see/read 10 times when walking a tree with 1024 nodes
[20:24:06] <doug65536> seek/read*
[20:24:09] <YammYcoding> does it applies to database searches as well? I saw that in database classes
[20:24:28] <doug65536> YammYcoding: yes, it is commonly used as database index algorithm
[20:24:58] <YammYcoding> =^^=
[20:26:23] <YammYcoding> well nice code on the fiddle, i never saw regex in js like this =) regex is everywhere hehe
[20:28:09] <doug65536> YammYcoding: normally people would call a function to read a cookie but I just parsed the cookie right there. ; and = will not occur in a valid cookie value, and \b will match nothingness if page= is at the beginning, else whitespace, so it should work correctly
[20:29:18] <YammYcoding> hmm fiddles can be saved?
[20:29:26] <doug65536> yes, of course
[20:29:35] <petey> Does anyone please have a second to help me? This is driving me nuts
[20:29:38] <tapmodo> fiddles can only be played, on the roof
[20:29:40] <doug65536> YammYcoding:  each save saves a new revision, it won't overwrite
[20:29:53] <petey> External links and scrolling with some bootstrap
[20:30:09] <petey> The last two external links arent opening at all, nothing happens
[20:30:11] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/4EvmY/
[20:30:22] <wad> Hi folks. I'm working on a project to teach myself javascript and jquery. Say the dom has a div it, with the id "mydiv". I want to add a <p>text</p> inside the div. How do I do this? $("mydiv").append("<p>text</p>") will put it after the div, right? Not in it?
[20:31:02] <ezrios> petey: "Bookings" and "Reserve"?
[20:31:02] <doug65536> wad: no. append appends child
[20:31:03] <YammYcoding> lol fiddle can't send password reminder :'/
[20:31:07] <petey> Yes ezrios
[20:31:21] <wad> doug65536, ah, thanks!
[20:31:29] <petey> wad I think there's a .children command
[20:31:31] <doug65536> wad: also, $("mydiv") isn't valid. there is no <mydiv> html tag
[20:31:44] <doug65536> wad: you need $('#mydiv') if mydiv is the id
[20:31:48] <ezrios> petey: they are working fine in firefox 17
[20:31:52] <wad> Oh, $("#mydiv") is what I meant. :)
[20:31:57] * wad <------------------------- learning
[20:31:58] <petey> Hm. ALright ezrios, thanks
[20:32:08] <petey> There must be something I'm screwing up somewhere in the real code then, lol
[20:32:12] <ezrios> "Bookings" opens a separate tab though
[20:32:31] <petey> Yeah I have it opening up a _blank
[20:32:59] <doug65536> wad: if you want a safer way to append text that won't be vulnerable to XSS attacks, do $('#mydiv').append($('<p>').text("text"));
[20:33:00] <ezrios> also works on chromium 27
[20:33:23] <wad> doug65536, yeah, that's a good idea. I thought about that.
[20:34:22] <wad> Hmm... basically, any text that the user enters into my application needs to be checked for injection of tags, huh.
[20:34:26] <doug65536> wad: yes, the word "text" is safe but if a variable is there or something user supplied then use .text on a p document fragment
[20:34:38] <doug65536> wad: don't ever check, just escape things properly
[20:34:59] <doug65536> wad: if you "check" I guarantee they will malform it sufficiently to get by your check
[20:34:59] <wad> I've got a dialog where the user can enter a name. Should I run that text through a scrubber of some sort?
[20:35:12] <wad> doug65536, http://zerbat.com <--- my project
[20:36:08] <tapmodo> it's quite non-css'y
[20:36:20] <tapmodo> oh..
[20:36:25] <tapmodo> it loaded... :)
[20:37:14] <wad> Yeah, loads kinda slow. I've got an idea how to fix that. :)
[20:37:42] <doug65536> yeah i got long delay on the css too
[20:38:12] <wad> It's because it has to preload a couple of rather large images.
[20:38:38] <wad> I'm eventually going to make an adjustment so that it will load those in the background.
[20:38:41] <doug65536> wad: you could defer those loads until document ready. set the src there
[20:39:06] <petey> looks like a cool idea wad
[20:39:16] <tapmodo> dudez... you're providing the perfect segue for what i want to talk about! haha
[20:40:12] <wad> Large chunks of the programming are now done, but there is very little actual content yet. What has been done are a bunch of subsystems, to handle things like skill level increases, finding treasure, handing time, traveling, managing inventory, etc.
[20:40:30] <wad> I'm still working on a few more systems, trying to figure out this jquery stuff.
[20:40:33] <doug65536> wad: I like it
[20:40:38] <tapmodo> so you're like... trying to really learn about the web development
[20:40:46] <wad> Once I get a bunch of that stuff done, then I can easily drop in a bunch of cool content.
[20:41:09] <wad> And the game will become playable. Right now it's not much fun, all you can do is wander around and find food.
[20:41:22] <wad> tapmodo, yep.
[20:41:39] <wad> I've been doing Java back-end for a decade or so. Time to learn some front end. :)
[20:42:35] <doug65536> wad: I'm starving. any tips on how to hunt?
[20:42:42] <wad> Seek food. :)
[20:42:52] <wad> You'll find something eventually, or it will tell you to look elsewhere.
[20:43:03] <wad> Every terrain type yields different types of food.
[20:43:55] <wad> I'm currently working on what happens when you arrive at a location (such as your wrecked ship).
[20:43:59] <tapmodo> i can see that you have put some effort into it, but my friend recently showed me this thing called "fivesecondtest"... i'm failing on that one right now
[20:44:16] <doug65536> wad: noticed a few small bugs. if you seek food when you are tired, you can't because you need to sleep. if you then sleep, it seeks food by itself
[20:44:17] <tapmodo> and/or i'm not sure i have the right expectations/understanding...
[20:44:19] <wad> what does fivesecondtest mean?
[20:44:31] <wad> doug65536, I'll try it, thanks!
[20:44:49] <tapmodo> just like, i have a goal in mind... show me the interface for five seconds... can i find the goal correctly
[20:45:01] <wad> Notice if you try to walk into the ocean, it will instead follow the contour of the land. Clever bit of coding, that was....
[20:45:17] <tapmodo> that's not to discount the kind of learning value of an ambitious project
[20:45:22] <wad> tapmodo, ah, okay! What was the goal you had in mind?
[20:45:44] <tapmodo> i loaded the page, and i don't know what to do
[20:45:53] <tapmodo> i did "start a new game"
[20:45:55] <tapmodo> and i see a map
[20:46:00] * wad nods
[20:46:39] <wad> Clicking on the big map doesn't do anything. Hmm. I should fix that.
[20:46:50] <wad> Clicking on the big map should cause movement.
[20:46:58] * wad adds it to the list of things to do
[20:47:04] <tapmodo> ....right... eventually i even tried cursor keys, etc
[20:47:37] <wad> Did you try clicking on the small square map?
[20:47:51] <tapmodo> the red square?
[20:48:00] <wad> In the upper-right.
[20:48:05] <wad> Is it not loaded?
[20:48:13] <wad> It's a zoom-in of the main map.
[20:48:23] <wad> Might need to refresh the page.
[20:48:43] <wad> To trigger a load.
[20:48:55] <wad> Oh, this thing is horribly slow in Firefox, but plenty fast in Chrome.
[20:49:03] <tapmodo> hrm
[20:49:06] <tapmodo> i'm using chroe
[20:49:31] <tapmodo> i was just mentioning that i don't know if it's a case of it not working correctly for me, or it not making sense to me
[20:49:59] <wad> Tapmodo, do you see a little square map right above the "set travel speed" button?
[20:50:36] <wad> The red square corresponds to the size of the map you see in the upper-right corner map.
[20:50:37] <tapmodo> hahaha ... you know what's funny... my window was too narrow
[20:50:46] <wad> Oh my!
[20:52:08] <tapmodo> so that's kind of my fault
[20:52:33] <tapmodo> i don't think your goal was to create the ultimate "responsive" interface
[20:53:09] <wad> My goals: learn javasript, make a fun game. In that order.
[20:53:23] <tapmodo> however, definitely an ambitious "teach yourself javascript" project
[20:53:34] * wad is a born programmer
[20:53:44] <tapmodo> yes... you java programmer you
[20:54:01] <tapmodo> so i can relate... and like i said, a good segue
[20:54:04] <wad> Actually, this is the prequel to the website I want to make.
[20:54:22] <tapmodo> about five years ago i bit off a pretty ambitious jQuery plugin
[20:54:23] <wad> I'm planning on building a basic interpreter in Javascript, for teaching kids to program in a fun way.
[20:54:31] <tapmodo> that has actually been quite popular...
[20:54:52] <tapmodo> you may have heard of or used "Jcrop"... included in wordpress, etc
[20:55:08] <wad> I wrote the BASIC interpreter in Java, and it runs in an applet. But the applet idea sucks. http://funwithbasic.com
[20:55:22] * wad looks up jcrop
[20:55:33] <tapmodo> anyway... recently i completely rewrote it... from the ground up...
[20:55:42] <tapmodo> and now i'm happy to say the code kicks ass
[20:55:46] <tapmodo> in my opinion
[20:55:48] <wad> Sweet!
[20:55:51] <wad> Nice tool.
[20:55:54] <tapmodo> i would like you all to scrutinize it
[20:56:16] <tapmodo> new work at: http://beta.jcrop.org/demos/basic.html
[20:56:31] <tapmodo> you can check out the demos
[20:56:37] <tapmodo> and look at the Jcrop.js code
[20:56:43] <tapmodo> the rest of the site is in progress
[20:57:30] <tapmodo> now it's based completely on javascript prototypical objects... and mostly feature compatible with the old version
[20:57:39] <wad> tapmodo, what was the deal with the google blacklist last year?
[20:58:30] <tapmodo> who knows... something happened. luckily i was able to find some google employee who was able to right it for me. but it was kind of chilling.
[20:58:51] <wad> That's freaky. A friend of mine works at google now. So maybe I have an in. :)
[20:59:19] <wad> Ok, I've seriously got to get some code written tonight. :)
[21:00:18] <wad> That's the biggest problem with getting help on IRC on freenode.... get caught up in awesome geeky conversations with fellow coder.
[21:00:23] <tapmodo> (Y)
[21:06:41] <doug65536> tapmodo: looks nice. any unit tests?
[21:07:06] <tapmodo> i'm not that smart
[21:07:08] <tapmodo> :)
[21:07:28] <doug65536> tapmodo: check out qunit. it's very small and easy to use
[21:08:01] <tapmodo> right. i get the value of doing such a thing, i'm just not sure i see "how"
[21:08:19] <doug65536> tapmodo: I'm always amazed by how many tests fail with code that I *think* works
[21:08:51] <tapmodo> yes. well, now that it's more of a true API it might be more feasible
[21:09:07] <tapmodo> i don't see how it could be totally tested though.
[21:09:18] <tapmodo> robot hand moving virtual mouse? haha
[21:09:59] <doug65536> tapmodo: it can't be totally tested. just test expectations, like, after I do X, then Y should return Z
[21:10:18] <tapmodo> yeah... i'm interested in it if it can be done
[21:10:55] <tapmodo> currently the unit tests are "me"
[21:10:55] <doug65536> tapmodo: it's comforting to run tests after you change something and see that they all pass.
[21:11:01] <tapmodo> and i think it's doing pretty good
[21:11:08] <doug65536> tapmodo: yeah, that's called "monkey testing"
[21:11:20] <tapmodo> but i get that part of the idea of unit tests is that something in the future doesn't break something
[21:12:02] <tapmodo> the world tells me i'm a monkey... so it makes sense
[21:12:44] <tapmodo> anyway... unit tests are good... but i consider that pedantry
[21:12:47] <tapmodo> :)
[21:12:59] <doug65536> tapmodo: even if you can't truly test that it did what it was supposed to, it will catch crashes that you introduce
[21:13:25] <doug65536> tapmodo: and give you a nice harness that does one thing when debugging
[21:13:38] <tapmodo> nothing wrong with pedantry per se... but time is money, etc
[21:14:10] <tapmodo> for sure tons of time has gone into figuring out the "infrastructure", documentation, and such
[21:14:15] <doug65536> tapmodo: tests save time and embarrassment. having a solid plugin that won't crash on you is money
[21:14:23] <tapmodo> unit tests are like that... valuable... i just don't have, as you say, a framework
[21:14:34] <doug65536> qunit
[21:14:40] <tapmodo> so i'll look into that
[21:14:48] <doug65536> at least look at qunit docs. it is VERY simple and easy to get started
[21:15:01] <tapmodo> some people have said grunt, etc... and i'm looking into that and yeah, that was my reaction.. "grunt"...
[21:15:48] <doug65536> tapmodo: trust me, once you start writing and using unit tests, you will be convinced that they find lots of bugs and are worthwhile. I've never written a bunch of tests that all passed. they always find bugs
[21:15:56] <tapmodo> maybe i have ADHD, i don't know
[21:15:57] <tapmodo> :)
[21:16:34] <tapmodo> yeah, i definitely get what you're saying
[21:17:22] <tapmodo> i'm not a classically trained CS guy or anything, but i am into the concepts.... the problem is, i'm also resistant to change and spending time delving into documentation, even stuff that would help me
[21:18:22] <tapmodo> i'll check out qunit if you think it will be of benefit
[21:18:40] <wad> tapmodo: tests are *important*.
[21:19:11] <wad> About 3/4 of my time spent coding is with the tests.
[21:19:43] <wad> I haven't done much testing on zerbat, just because it's a learning exercise. I did write my own little unit testing framework for it, though. :)
[21:19:52] <tapmodo> indeed
[21:20:03] <wad> I called it SLUTF.
[21:20:11] <wad> Simple Little Unit Test Framework.
[21:20:35] <wad> But if you turn on the javascript console, and refresh the page, you'll see all my unit tests run.
[21:21:25] <wad> Unit testing in Javascript seems extra important, because it doesn't compile! You either catch the bugs in tests, or at runtime. Ouch!
[21:22:47] <snover> if you are going to do unit testing, use intern
[21:23:06] <wad> what's intern?
[21:23:22] <wad> Is it a unit test library?

[21:24:15] <wad> ah
[21:24:53] <wad> What is BDD?
[21:25:41] <wad> Wow, intern looks great!
[21:26:42] <tapmodo> when i first sent out Jcrop to the jquery mailing list, in 2008... i was harrangued by some folks for not using jquery-ui for dragging...which i still don't think could work...
[21:26:51] <tapmodo>  then i sent it out to this channel again at some point a few years ago, and people bugged about the tabs and spacing of the source code... so i consider this an improvement...
[21:27:15] <tapmodo> i will check out these unit test libraries... because i agree it would be good to have... in a perfect world
[21:31:11] <javalover> so wierd
[21:31:21] <javalover> i removed the z:index & now it's really hard to cause the bug
[22:59:49] <ryzzan> here's the question:
[23:00:50] <ryzzan> i have this form... and i have this another form coming from an external file using ajax to get it opened in a div where the first form is...
[23:01:20] <ryzzan> and there is this <script> in the first form code... and i want this script to be used in the form coming from the external file
[23:01:23] <ryzzan> is it possible?
[23:01:45] <Cork> ryzzan: depends on how you have written the code
[23:02:15] <Cork> ryzzan: if you've added event listeners with delegated structure, then sure; else, most likely not
[23:02:58] <ryzzan> would u take a look in an example i did?
[23:03:13] <Cork> don't ask to ask
[23:03:32] <ryzzan> asking u to take a look
[23:03:40] <ryzzan> just trying to be polite... lol...
[23:03:41] <ryzzan> http://moderatoro.com/testing/n-moderatoro/estudo/ajax/
[23:04:27] <Cork> ryzzan: polite in an irc support channel just forces ppl to drop what they're doing to ask for more information
[23:05:21] <ryzzan> sry for trying to be polite then... :)
[23:05:22] <Cork> ryzzan: if you mean the validation resource, then no, as it is written it won't work on new form elements
[23:06:17] <Cork> ryzzan: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[23:06:23] <ryzzan> ty
[23:13:23] <doug65536> seriously? chrome just shows blank page if request returns 401 unauthorized?
[23:14:41] <Cork> doug65536: you mean they don't render the content?
[23:14:54] <doug65536> so does firefox
[23:15:06] <Cork> doug65536: no they render the content
[23:15:17] <doug65536> yes, if I look at network thing in debugger, I see 401 unauthorized, but no indication of problem to normal user
[23:15:28] <Cork> if you don't send any content, then sure you get a white page
[23:15:40] <doug65536> for a 4xx http status?
[23:15:47] <Cork> yes
[23:16:16] <Cork> the only status that doesn't need content is 3xx series
[23:16:37] <Cork> though 404 is often hidden by the browser
[23:16:51] <Cork> but it should still have content
[23:17:05] <doug65536> browser practically ignores the http status then
[23:17:29] <wookiehangover> server's gotta send content
[23:17:30] <Cork> doug65536: well http status is for programs to know what happens
[23:17:32] <doug65536> except maybe 304 and a couple of others
[23:17:34] <Cork> content is for user
[23:18:22] <Cork> doug65536: so yes if you only care about web spiders and similar you don't need to offer content for 4xx and 5xx statuses
[23:18:36] <dblosevn> Hey :-)
[23:18:37] <Cork> but as soon as there is a human navigating the site you should
[23:18:42] <wookiehangover> or if you're handling the request with ajax
[23:18:53] <Cork> true
[23:19:12] <doug65536> I tried putting an ajax request in the address bar to see what happens... it is supposed to return 401 unauthorized because they haven't authenticated, but was surprised to get quiet white page
[23:19:13] <Cork> though then it's arguably not the user navigating :)
[23:19:34] <dblosevn> Anybody know what the best way to attach all events from one element to another and then destroy the previous element?
[23:19:37] <Cork> doug65536: cause your server isn't configured correctly then
[23:19:57] <Cork> dblosevn: basically that's not possible
[23:20:21] <doug65536> Cork: so I should send json even when failing with 401 then? would that make sense? can $.ajax see the response if 401?
[23:20:23] <dblosevn> im trying to get a plugin to have the behavior that I want without modifying it
[23:20:44] <Cork> dblosevn: in a hacky way you can do $._data(element, 'events'), loop over the events and create them on the second element
[23:20:53] <Cork> dblosevn: though that will only work for jquery attached events
[23:21:21] <dblosevn> ya and its not a jquery plugin :-( I cant find a plugin that been made already for jquery
[23:21:43] <Cork> doug65536: well json isn't meant for user, so your server should detect that it isn't requesting json and send html
[23:21:50] <doug65536> Cork: would I do xhr.done(... in error: function?
[23:22:01] <Cork> doug65536: .fail()
[23:22:08] <Cork> or error:
[23:22:13] <dblosevn> I guess the better question would be if you know of a good jquery ios uipickerview plugin lol
[23:23:09] <doug65536> Cork: yes, question is: I don't seem to see a data parameter in error handler - if I did send data with 401, how would I retrieve it in ajax error: function(xhr,status,thrown) { ...
[23:23:21] <Cork> doug65536: there isn't one
[23:23:44] <Cork> doug65536: xhr.responseXML
[23:23:53] <dblosevn> the only one I have found thats even close is http://cubiq.org/spinning-wheel-on-webkit-for-iphone-ipod-touch but I would prefer a jquery implementation, if worse comes to worse I guess I can port this over to jquery but I really dont want to have to spend much time on it
[23:23:57] <doug65536> Cork: ok, thanks
[23:24:17] <Cork> doug65536: though don't miss understand you SHOULD send http status
[23:24:24] <Cork> doug65536: and ajax should depend on that value
[23:24:38] <Cork> doug65536: but the server should have user readable data too
[23:25:35] <doug65536> Cork: ah ok, so it would be acceptable to send content along with a 401 unauthorized, and trust that only a human would see the output and $.ajax wouldn't really care if it were json?
[23:25:42] <dblosevn> Ya I usually look for accept headers or the x-requested-with header or both to determine json or html
[23:25:45] <doug65536> weren't json
[23:25:55] <Cork> dblosevn: i don't write os or browser specific ui's as i see that as greatly flawed to begin with
[23:25:58] <Funhouse> Hi everyone, does anyone know if there is a plugin that will tell specifically that a user has switch tabs?
[23:27:02] <Cork> Funhouse: no a plugin no
[23:27:09] <doug65536> Cork: in the case of a semi-malicious user putting an ajax request url in the address bar. maybe a blank page would be more deterring than a nice error message
[23:27:19] <Cork> Funhouse: though you could try listning for the blur event on the window object
[23:27:34] <Cork> Funhouse: but normally you should not care
[23:28:29] <Cork> doug65536: well i don't see a point in "nice" but something like <h1>401 Unauthorized</h1> should be the least one could send
[23:28:53] <doug65536> Cork: ok, will do that. thanks
[23:31:32] <Funhouse> Cork: Thank you.  yeah but blue basically is for anything, even when I click outside of window like bookmarks bar or something.
[23:31:36] <Funhouse> blur*
[23:32:09] <Cork> Funhouse: yes, and that is the closest you can get, without extending the feature set in the browser
[23:32:41] <Funhouse> Yeah that sucks. But I guess you don't want animations running in the background using CPU.
[23:33:00] <Cork> Funhouse: use css3 animation or requestAnimationFrame
[23:33:15] <Cork> those stop when the page is not visible
[23:33:28] <Funhouse> Cork: I do. The problem is, when using animations with setTimeout, they are freeze when clicking on another tab.
[23:33:35] <Funhouse> all*
[23:33:45] <Funhouse> Then run again when clicking back.
[23:34:22] <Cork> Funhouse: so use requestAnimationFrame
[23:34:38] <Cork> setTimeout doesn't care about visibility
[23:35:03] <Cork> (well it does as they change the min delay cap on visibility change)
[23:48:21] <doug65536> it boggles my mind that in all these years, assigning crap to document.cookie is still how you set cookies, instead of a proper API call
[23:49:06] <Cork> doug65536: it is cause of legacy
[23:49:20] <Cork> doug65536: if you go back to around where it was added
[23:49:34] <Cork> the browser just offered a fairly short string for cookie management
[23:50:01] <Cork> so document.cookie was exactly was the browser managed
[23:52:24] <doug65536> Cork: yeah, I understand, but the standards body should have added an api call and deprecated assignment to document.cookie after several years. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of implementations of document.cookie parsers have been written
[23:52:42] <Cork> doug65536: you mean like document.write?
[23:52:52] <Cork> the web more or less can't depricate anything :/
[23:56:33] <doug65536> it also blows my mind that jquery doesn't have any native cookie handling and it still requires a plugin. does that mean that jquery never adopts plugins, ever?
[23:57:08] <Cork> doug65536: cause most sites don't have to fiddle with the cookies
[23:58:17] <Cork> and especially as jquery is for dom manipulation and not everything else
