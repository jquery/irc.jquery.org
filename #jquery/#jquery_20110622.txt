[00:00:35] <coldhead> Z3R0: this is your project now
[00:00:40] <coldhead> LEND A HAND
[00:02:03] <kawohi808> damn this isn't working
[00:04:01] <coldhead> i don;t understand
[00:04:13] <coldhead> the thing about "this shows the content of..." works for me
[00:04:23] <coldhead> and both the Buy Now buttons open in a fancybox
[00:04:27] <coldhead> so....
[00:04:31] <kawohi808> ok
[00:04:33] <kawohi808> go to
[00:04:50] <Z3R0> link again ?
[00:04:51] <kawohi808>  here /form1.html and here form2.html
[00:05:09] <coldhead> Z3R0: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html
[00:05:22] <kawohi808> 2 different forms, trying to be loaded with ajax. only one form appears
[00:06:09] <Z3R0> they have the same id
[00:06:19] <kawohi808> oh and excuse what the page is about, im not selling it, lol its some other guy.
[00:06:21] <Z3R0> how are you referencing them separately ?
[00:06:27] <kawohi808> No idea how to.
[00:06:38] <Z3R0> give them unique id's
[00:06:44] <coldhead> the nth-child thing won't work
[00:06:57] <kawohi808> it has to be like this to work  <a id="inline" class="button" href="#data"> Buy Now </a>
[00:07:17] <Z3R0> one sec, loading your stuff into fiddle
[00:07:25] <kawohi808> and loads in:  <div style="display:none"><div id="data"
[00:07:27] <kawohi808> Ok
[00:07:27] <Z3R0> oh wait, can't... stupid things
[00:07:40] <Z3R0> I never had to do that...
[00:07:42] <coldhead> COME OVER HERE AND KISS ME KISS ME KISS ME
[00:08:32] <coldhead> kawohi808: i would expct you need <div id="data-one" and <div id="data-two"
[00:08:40] <Z3R0> $('#but200').click(function() { $('#data').show(function() { $('#data').load('form1.html)}; )};
[00:08:43] <coldhead> and then href="data-one" and href="data-two"
[00:08:56] <coldhead> but Z3R0's way is better
[00:09:04] <Z3R0> show the div, and then swap the content
[00:09:10] <Z3R0> callback's are your friend
[00:09:32] <Z3R0> let me see if I can get a working example without the fancybox part
[00:09:49] <kawohi808> thats not in the docs :/ http://fancybox.net/howto data-1 method
[00:10:15] <Z3R0> it's not a fancy box
[00:10:17] <Z3R0> it's jquery
[00:10:26] <Z3R0> fancybox is just the container
[00:10:57] <Z3R0> it's the same thing, it's just your waiting for one thing to happen before doing something else
[00:10:57] <kawohi808>  fancybox is the pop up :|
[00:11:07] <Z3R0> you can't manipulate the #data if it doesn't exist
[00:11:15] <Z3R0> so you must show the #data div...
[00:11:20] <Z3R0> then modify the #data div
[00:11:31] <Z3R0> but you must use a callback function in order to know when the previous part finished
[00:13:02] <kawohi808> ok i think that might work, ill try that now
[00:13:19] <Z3R0> I'm loading in fancybox atm in case it doesn't, I'll get it to work lol
[00:21:41] <kawohi808> now its loading #1 and not #1
[00:21:45] <kawohi808> #2
[00:21:49] <kawohi808> and NOT #1
[00:24:47] <coldhead> case CLOSED
[00:25:47] <gf3> "I see"
[00:25:51] <gf3> no, I do not
[00:26:04] <kawohi808> nvm, :/
[00:27:24] <kawohi808> wait i think i got it
[00:30:05] <kawohi808> YES i got it.... thank god. thank you Z3R0, your method worked
[00:30:14] <Z3R0> really ?
[00:30:19] <kawohi808> this project is finally done... time to clean it up and send it away
[00:30:28] <kawohi808> yup thank you
[00:30:30] <Z3R0> I can't even manage to get the stupid box to pop up
[00:30:38] <kawohi808> ill reupload
[00:30:58] <kawohi808> had to class="button button-1"
[00:31:06] <kawohi808> class="button button-2"
[00:31:19] <kawohi808> then use your method for each one
[00:31:21] <kawohi808> .click()
[00:31:22] <coldhead> lol
[00:31:23] <Z3R0> can you re-paste the code so I can fux with it some more ?
[00:31:23] <Z3R0> I don't know what i am missing
[00:31:29] <kawohi808> ok
[00:31:31] <kawohi808> lol
[00:31:37] <Z3R0> I can look at it nvm
[00:31:38] <Z3R0> I'll refresh
[00:31:41] <coldhead> the project is obviously cursed, and you've absorbed the curse for him, Z3R0
[00:31:44] <coldhead> thx
[00:32:36] <kawohi808> i don't think its cursed.. i mean the code looks clean, doesn't it? I'm just not that to good at jquery yet!
[00:32:50] <Z3R0> wait you sure it works?
[00:32:50] <Z3R0> because i still get the same forms
[00:33:12] <kawohi808> hold on
[00:33:17] <Z3R0> neither am I, I am kinda shocked it actually worked
[00:34:01] <Z3R0> z3yo and Z3R0 lolz
[00:34:13] <Z3R0> error 404 lolz
[00:34:16] <coldhead> projects can be cursed quite apart from the code
[00:34:41] <Z3R0> I still don't see why that has to be 2 forms...
[00:34:50] <Z3R0> you could get the same result using a single form and modifying the selected element
[00:35:02] <Z3R0> then when they want to change the form... they only have to fux with one
[00:35:23] <kawohi808> noe i know it worked. changed the form2 title
[00:35:25] <kawohi808> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html#public
[00:35:53] <Z3R0> damn chrome dev tools constantly freezing
[00:36:36] <kawohi808> i can't use dat... it sucks.. i use firebug
[00:36:42] <kawohi808> way better
[00:36:44] <kawohi808> imo.
[00:36:53] <Hierofant> Firebug is indeed way awesome.
[00:37:04] <Z3R0> firefox has too many memory leaks...
[00:37:31] <Hierofant> NOT ENOUGH YOU MEAN
[00:37:54] <kawohi808> firefox 4 is ok.. well i only use it for firebug anyways... chrome as a browser is way better
[00:38:04] <Puck`> +1 on that
[00:38:43] <kawohi808> and this firefox 5 thing is dumb... i just upgraded and all i got was my plugins isn't compitable... tho they still worked
[00:39:55] <Z3R0> see kaw rather than use form1 and form2 ... use form and where you load the #data add the line $('#order').val('0'); // and $('#order').val('1'); // respectively naming your <select> id='#order'
[00:40:16] <Z3R0> and then you can tell the people you are doing this for, that it is better for them, because when they want to update it, they only need to update it in one place
[00:40:31] <Z3R0> rather than duplicating compied data
[00:40:44] <kawohi808> nah, this was only a $100 project. imma leave it alone. idc for it.
[00:40:53] <kawohi808> It's done.
[00:40:56] <Z3R0> but it could be $110 for fun
[00:41:00] <Z3R0> hahahahaa
[00:41:09] <Z3R0> so wait...
[00:41:17] <Z3R0> we fixed your problem so YOU could make $100 ?
[00:41:27] <Z3R0> yep, i quit... going to bed now...
[00:41:31] <kawohi808> lol
[00:41:35] <kawohi808> thank you
[00:41:37] <Z3R0> almost 3am lolz
[00:41:41] <Z3R0> gotta be up in 4 hrs

[01:30:22] <techunter> hi, i need help with jquery and ajax
[01:30:41] <techunter> regarding multisession servlet ajax get
[01:35:29] <seutje> bot-t: tell matjas poing!
[01:35:30] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[01:36:31] <gnarf> wow, techhunter didn't even stay long enough to ask his question
[01:37:03] <BlackAnt> He came from a fast world.
[01:37:14] <jrockjiggz> is there a way todo .live('keydown' ?
[01:37:38] <Patatouf> hi, i am trying to refresh datas i want to use in an autocomplete with that script http://pastie.org/2105343, but it doesnt work. Any idea ?
[01:37:51] <BlackAnt> jrockjiggz use .live('change', function)
[01:38:19] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: live should work with keydown
[01:38:21] <jrockjiggz> BlackAnt: change e.keyCode ?
[01:39:08] <BlackAnt> jrockjiggz live keydown will also work
[01:39:43] <gnarf> Patatouf: .autocomplete("option", "source", data) ?
[01:39:49] <jrockjiggz> hmm .die('keydown').live('keydown'.. will not work. but .keydown() will...
[01:39:57] <Patatouf> gnard
[01:39:58] <Patatouf> 
[01:41:09] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/znnEX/
[01:41:41] <Patatouf> gnarf, oh i try (note that i am using the plugin, not the ui)
[01:42:01] <gnarf> Patatouf: you mean you aren't using ui.autocomplete?
[01:42:09] <gnarf> if so, then i have no idea
[01:42:17] <Patatouf> gnarf, yes, but it may be about the same
[01:42:19] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: why are you doing the die?
[01:42:51] <Patatouf> gnarf, I hope u got in 2 sec what I was looking for all day long yesterday
[01:43:01] <Patatouf> :)
[01:43:27] <jrockjiggz> keydown isn't being detected at all http://jsfiddle.net/znnEX/1/
[01:43:28] <gnarf> Patatouf: i would suggest using ui.autocomplete
[01:44:14] <gnarf> $(document).live makes NO sese
[01:44:19] <gnarf> bind
[01:44:29] <coldhead> sense*
[01:44:32] <Patatouf> gnarf, I tried to but I found easier way to change the css, to do a "one click dropdown autocomplete" and to change the "match" options using the plugin... :(
[01:44:58] <jrockjiggz> oh? how do i detect a keypress inside the browser?
[01:46:11] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: $(document).bind("keydown") should work fine
[01:46:19] <gnarf> just .live() doesn't make sense on $(document)
[01:46:44] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: problem i have is script is loading with ajax, i want to unbind before i bind
[01:46:48] <jrockjiggz> i guess i could just unbind
[01:47:14] <gnarf> or don't load your script multiple times
[01:48:49] <gnarf> sounds like bad app design to be passing JS code events to bind...
[01:49:48] <BlackAnt> :)
[01:55:35] <daniel3> So if I wanted to have a page load content only when the button is clicked, and store that page in a seperate file, $(object).load('/url/path/page.php')' would be sufficient under a click function, right?
[02:01:10] <BlackAnt> I just love this jQuery.
[02:01:15] <keybo> how do i add events to a change in a radio group?
[02:01:48] <BlackAnt> keybo see: ?change
[02:02:25] <BlackAnt> $("select").live('change',function() {
[02:02:44] <BlackAnt> keybo http://jsfiddle.net/U9wpV/12/
[02:03:31] <keybo> thanks blackant
[02:10:45] <adv_> how am i supposed to link jquery in the head tag?
[02:11:17] <Bittarman> with a script tag
[02:11:51] <adv_> Bittarman, example?
[02:13:01] <Bittarman> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+script+tag
[02:20:09] <MatthiasVance> I'm wondering, how do I set the contents of an iframe in opera etc? (since there is no <html></html> and no <body> by default)
[02:28:42] <PrinceES> I am looking for jquery slider same as you can see on it .. http://www.mcfc.co.uk/

[02:32:48] <nauthiz> hi all. Is there a way to build a dialog that remains visible for 10 secs and then disappears automatically?
[02:33:45] <hokapoka> nauthiz: use setTimeout
[02:34:14] <nauthiz> and wrap the whole dialog-function within the timeout?
[02:34:21] <nauthiz> or just the open-call?
[02:34:57] <hokapoka> pass it a function like : var handle = setTimeout(function(){ $("myDialog").hide();  }, 10000);
[02:35:08] <Juo> if i am trying to search the alt tags of images within a div with the class jquery_image what is wrong with the following code (".jquery_image img").attr("alt") ?
[02:35:34] <hokapoka> Juo: that's returning the alt's value
[02:35:37] <hokapoka> you need:
[02:35:49] <hokapoka> $(".foo img[alt]")
[02:35:52] <Juo> im doing ($this).text() == so do want the value
[02:36:07] <Juo> http://jsfiddle.net/UM7ZN/
[02:36:16] <hokapoka> That'll return all of the images that have alt tags, then you can use .each() to extract the differnet values
[02:36:25] <hrwath> $(this)
[02:36:29] <hrwath> not ($this)
[02:37:05] <hrwath> $(".jquery_image img")
[02:37:15] <hrwath> $() is a function
[02:37:53] <hokapoka> Any suggestion about the best way to return the label of the optgroup that contains the selected valu of a select?
[02:39:00] <hokapoka> var sel = $("select");  sel.find("option[value=\"" + sel.val() + "\"]").parent() is working but I'm not really happy with it.
[02:40:05] <hokapoka> I've tried to use the :parent selector within the .find like this : sel.find("option[value=\"" + sel.val() + "\"]:parent") but it just returns the selected option.
[02:40:31] <nauthiz> hm, is the label the parent of the option?
[02:40:44] <nauthiz> do you label the select or every single option?
[02:40:48] <hokapoka> the label of the optgroup
[02:40:59] <nail_> hokapoka: $('option:selected').parent('optgroup').attr('label')
[02:41:21] <hokapoka> <select> <optgroup lable="bar"><option value="foo"></option></optgroup></select>
[02:41:43] <hokapoka> nail_: sweet, that's more like what I was after.
[02:42:34] <nauthiz> again learned smth new, never used optgroups before oO
[02:43:31] <hokapoka> Is there a selector to return the element that has a child of a given selector?
[02:44:33] <nail_> :has()
[02:45:13] <hokapoka> so I could have : $("optgroup { option:selected }") where the { and } denote that the optgroup should be returned if they have a child that's option:selected
[02:45:18] <hokapoka> aha
[02:45:38] <hokapoka> $("optgroup:has(option:selected)")
[02:46:21] <hokapoka> sweet that works.
[02:46:25] <hokapoka> nail, many thanks
[02:49:29] <LilaQ> Could anyone help me real quick?
[02:49:40] <Guest82322> hi
[02:50:32] <LilaQ> I have a div I want to slide down and hide, and on top of that div, I have another div which shall slide down too, but NOT hide. The second div is supposed to be the toggler for the first div. Any ideas how to solve this?
[02:50:43] <nVee> how do I pass variables into a custom function? (e.g. $(".class").click(function("SHOULD I PASS THEM IN HERE?") {});  ?
[02:51:50] <BlackAnt> .hoverIntent
[02:51:52] <BlackAnt> 				(
[02:51:53] <BlackAnt> 				 	{
[02:51:55] <BlackAnt> 						sensitivity: 100,
[02:51:57] <BlackAnt> 						interval: 550,
[02:51:59] <BlackAnt> 						out: mouseOff,
[02:52:02] <BlackAnt> 						over: mouseOn,

[02:52:26] <zxm_> I am inheriting ui.slider. The problem is that my widget doesnt trigger ui.slider events (slidechange, slide etc). Why is it so?
[02:52:28] <CKIDOW> pasty?
[02:52:34] <BlackAnt> mouseOff and mouseOn are custome functions
[02:52:37] <SugaSlide> ?paste
[02:52:37] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[02:52:48] <CKIDOW> voilá
[02:53:20] <zxm_> I'm doing this way $.widget( "ui.slider2", $.ui.slider, {..});
[02:54:18] <BlackAnt> so write one this way function mouseOff() { $(".someId") .css({visibility: "hidden"});
[02:54:47] <BlackAnt> @ nVee
[02:55:02] <Adman65> given a ul, and a li in it, how I can I find the "next" li ?
[02:55:46] <Juo> is it possible do this? $(".div_class[img|=" + $(this).text()).show(); based off http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[02:58:08] <nVee> wait, BlackAnt, all I want to find out is how can I pass variables which is assigned into a function?
[02:58:18] <nVee> so that I can use them in the function?
[02:58:56] <aaronmcadam> what function?
[02:58:58] <BlackAnt> nVee pass them inside the custom function. You can use the live jquery
[02:59:37] <BlackAnt> function mouseOff() { var $stuff = $('id', this).val(); );
[02:59:47] <LilaQ> is there any way I can slide a div, and it won't hide or reset it's position on the end of the effect?
[02:59:51] <BlackAnt> mouseOff( { call it here})
[03:00:10] <BlackAnt> from mouseOff() { var $stuff = $('id', this).val(); ); I think
[03:01:17] <LilaQ> BlackAnt - any idea?

[03:25:31] <johanhar> text() is the right one, I figure
[03:25:35] <keybo> how can i check a radio input with jquery within a click event?
[03:26:24] <johanhar> no.. :(

[03:26:54] <keybo> s'ok gotit
[03:26:58] <keybo> oh, thanks anyway :P
[03:27:15] <johanhar> <option>Something</option> - how can I get "Something" ? .text() and .html() didnt work
[03:27:41] <xec> johanhar: they should both work .. IF its a jquery object..?
[03:27:45] <ablomen> johanhar, $("theSelectBox").val()
[03:27:52] <xec> oh
[03:27:53] <xec> :D
[03:30:12] <johanhar> xec: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'text' of object #<HTMLOptionElement> is not a function - I think it is a jquery object
[03:30:26] <johanhar> ablomen: that is something that could work yea :) I will try that
[03:31:08] <xec> johanhar: http://jsfiddle.net/cC8R7/
[03:31:28] <johanhar> But xec, what I do is that I call .each() on $("#select_id option) and inside the each-function do a this.text()
[03:31:50] <xec> do $(this).text()
[03:32:29] <johanhar> AH! Ofc, thanks :)
[03:32:34] <xec> :)

[04:06:29] <rohit00082002> hello
[04:07:18] <rohit00082002> I am using slickgrid and if I include jquery.validate.min.js then in slickgrid header filter is not working
[04:07:56] <rohit00082002> what should I do ?
[04:12:14] <aaronmcadam> Aamir, I meant anyone using it
[04:12:44] <shamess> I need to pass a second argument (a date to check each of the elements against) to the .filter(function(index){}) method... Can I do that?
[04:12:49] <aaronmcadam> rohit00082002, what happens if u include validate before slickgrid
[04:13:09] <shamess> Oh, nevermind. I was being dumb.
[04:13:26] <rohit00082002> same result.. I tried it including everywhere
[04:13:36] <aaronmcadam> firebug error?
[04:14:10] <nVee> Hey guys. When I pass a variable into a custom function and alert the variable name in the function, it says it is an object, yet the passed in value was only a string variable. How can I get access to just the string?
[04:14:13] <rohit00082002> it doesn't give error... but filter in header doesn't work
[04:14:38] <aaronmcadam> don't use alert nVee
[04:14:48] <rohit00082002> even I tried changing name of function as filter2 yet doesn't work
[04:14:57] <nVee> even if I put in in an html it still says object Object
[04:15:00] <aaronmcadam> use firebug or chrome/safari dev tools console
[04:15:12] <aaronmcadam> and use console.log( string )
[04:15:54] <aaronmcadam> could try wrapping it in a closure if it's not already rohit00082002
[04:16:27] <Aamir> ?p @nVee
[04:16:27] <bot-t> nVee, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[04:16:59] <rohit00082002> wrapping in a closure means ?
[04:17:17] <Aamir> rohit00082002:  (function(){})
[04:17:40] <aaronmcadam> make sure the code is wrapped in a self executing function
[04:17:56] <aaronmcadam> as Aamir says, you could do (function(){})();
[04:18:11] <rohit00082002> ok let me try it.
[04:18:19] <aaronmcadam> (function($){})(jQuery);
[04:18:35] <aaronmcadam> it means the code will run only within it's own scp[e
[04:18:37] <aaronmcadam> scope*
[04:19:01] <rohit00082002> okay
[04:19:30] <aaronmcadam> so if you initialised your slickgrid in one
[04:19:36] <aaronmcadam> and then include validate and did that
[04:19:42] <aaronmcadam> hacky but might work
[04:20:03] <nVee> http://jsfiddle.net/Q4XW6/1/
[04:20:03] <rohit00082002> oh okay

[04:20:28] <nVee> :P
[04:20:29] <aaronmcadam> i told you
[04:20:32] <aaronmcadam> use firebug
[04:20:57] <aaronmcadam> it's a string object of course
[04:21:16] <aaronmcadam> js creates an obj from your string literal
[04:21:27] <nVee> i see
[04:21:27] <aaronmcadam> that's why it says object
[04:21:28] <Aamir> nVee: the first argument is event
[04:21:40] <aaronmcadam> heh yeah
[04:21:48] <aaronmcadam> u don't need to pass in the variable nVee
[04:21:57] <nVee> will it just be available?
[04:22:02] <aaronmcadam> course
[04:22:06] <aaronmcadam> you defined it above

[05:03:02] <seutje> nauthiz: .ui-dialog-titlebar-close { position: absolute; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0); }
[05:04:08] <Tobsn> is anyone using jquery bbq? i just started using it or i try to and its not working at all
[05:05:47] <nauthiz> seutje: how do i use the rects with the .css()-function?
[05:06:23] <nauthiz> just .css("clip","rect(0, 0, 0, 0)"); ?
[05:06:44] <seutje> if u insist on having a fuzzy line between behaviors and styles whilst killing a bit of performance in the process
[05:06:44] <neology> hi.. the problem is when I append or remove any object from the paginated set using jquery, I have to refresh the pagination links as well.. is there a better solution?
[05:06:59] <seutje> also, I doubt jQuery catches the IE shit with rect()
[05:08:06] <neology> when I append a new object (comment), the last comment again appears on the next page) and when I remove a comment, the first comment on the next page doesnt show up when I hit next page..
[05:08:07] <nauthiz> erm, btw, $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").hide(); is doing what I want it to ^^
[05:08:55] <nauthiz> but thx, you pointed me to the right direction ;)
[05:10:13] <seutje> nauthiz: again, it works, if u insist of having inline styles and killing off a tiny bit of your performance
[05:17:14] <nauthiz> i see your point, but I don't want every dialog to lose it's close-button, but this specific one
[05:17:34] <nauthiz> thats why i can't define this as global style
[05:34:17] <nauthiz> question: i fire an ajax which returns the strings "true" or "false" on return, is there a way to use these strings as bool-values in my callback-function?
[05:34:48] <nauthiz> so that returnData = false instead of returnData = "false"
[05:40:05] <GreyTrilby> Hi Guys
[05:40:19] <GreyTrilby> Strange jquery/php issue here, hoping you can help
[05:40:31] <GreyTrilby> 3 tabs, all have similar functionality
[05:42:01] <GreyTrilby> Tab 1 shows a list of items (e.g. mystuff.php) . On clicking an item it does an ajax call to itself, listing details of that item, that item then has an edit option
[05:42:26] <GreyTrilby> Click edit, make a change, click save - all is well with the world. There is also now the optino to 'return to list'.
[05:42:49] <GreyTrilby> You can, however, at this point, jump to tab 2, which has the same functionality, but for another type of item
[05:43:25] <GreyTrilby> The problem is that if I repeat that process in tab 2, when I click save, it returns to a default setting which I don't quite understand, and doesn't do the save
[05:43:38] <GreyTrilby> if on tab 1, however, I return to the list, tab 2 works fine
[05:44:17] <GreyTrilby> any thoughts please chaps & chappesses?

[06:08:23] <GreyTrilby> which property?

[06:10:27] <mikau> Hi folks! I've run into a strange problem using jQuery UI button-elements. It works really well in general, but at one place on my site it starts acting up. I've collected a pair of checkboxes in a table, separated into two td-elements. The buttons in the first td gets two <span class="ui-button-text"> inside the label (nested, not one after the other), and the ones in the next td has three levels of them. Is this a known bug?
[06:10:27] <mikau>  What can I do to solve it?
[06:13:02] <has1> GreyTrilby: http://jsfiddle.net/cHYWA/
[06:14:41] <GreyTrilby> has1 - sorry, I'm being dumb here - need to see code for ngg.js
[06:15:15] <arpegius> so i've got jquery templating in a django template: {{ html Message }}  … since its the same syntax, django's trying to parse it. can i 'escape' those braces somehow?
[06:16:48] <GreyTrilby> @arpegius - I guess you've tried using a backslash, or putting them in quotes?
[06:16:54] <has1> GreyTrilby but ngg is short for the nextgen plugin i think
[06:17:01] <has1> has nothing to do with the slider
[06:17:17] <GreyTrilby> that's where firebug says there's an error...
[06:17:37] <GreyTrilby> try disabling the nextgen plugin, see if the slider works then
[06:17:49] <has1> ok
[06:19:30] <has1> damn it works now
[06:20:28] <has1> Greytrilby ngg.js: http://jsfiddle.net/T5nhu/
[06:20:28] <GreyTrilby> you might have to contact original developer I'm afraid, or see if there's any documentation on it
[06:20:35] <termleech> is there a jquery mobile irc channel or do you ask the questions in here?
[06:20:55] <termleech> wait nevermind
[06:20:59] <termleech> i should read the motd
[06:23:22] <GreyTrilby> @has1 - I think the problem IS in that file then, but I'm afraid I'm not the right person to look at it - best contact developer - sorry I can't be momre help!
[06:23:26] <GreyTrilby> \quit
[06:24:45] <has1> Ok thank you :)
[06:25:33] <has1> how do you see that theres a problem with ngg.js causing the next button not to work? so i can describe the problem to the nextgen developer

[06:48:13] <Bartzy|work> I need to do if (var1==false) ?
[06:48:29] <Bartzy|work> sorry, var1='string' , then I do if (!var1).
[06:48:40] <Bartzy|work> And that evaluates , enters the 'if'. Why ?
[06:48:53] <erichynds> wat
[06:49:05] <BlackAnt> ?
[06:49:36] <BlackAnt> '=', '==', & '===' aint the same thing
[06:49:37] <erichynds> "" will eval to false, "anything else" evals to true
[06:50:47] <BlackAnt> erichynds you wana check if its a string. then return true?
[06:50:58] <erichynds> i don't want to do anything
[06:51:05] <erichynds> Bartzy|work does though
[06:51:21] <cbobo> Are there any issues/functions were jQuery does not work  in ie?
[06:51:33] <cbobo> or is it cross browser solid
[06:51:36] <Bartzy|work> erichynds: That's not what I see for some reason. I'll pastebin.
[06:52:06] <erichynds> cbobo: unless you stumbled upon a bug or are using jQuery incorrectly, it'll work in IE just fine
[06:52:46] <cbobo> Okay thanks, I was not sure if I had to read a list of problems that will happen in ie and then avoid them
[06:53:24] <BlackAnt> using jQuery correcly sometimes makes i.e lazy dude
[06:53:49] <cbobo> Are there any good articals about this?
[06:54:02] <cbobo> and common issues I should learn to avoid
[06:54:23] <erichynds> that's the point of jQuery - to deliver a cross-browser compatible solution
[06:54:33] <cbobo> okay great =]
[06:54:54] <cbobo> ya jQuery works in ipad,iphone,andriod,ie,ff,chrome
[06:54:57] <cbobo> is what I have been testing on
[06:55:13] <AdvoWork> i know i can do: $('#new_sort_header').remove();  but what if ive got x amount of rows that are like my_row_1, my_row_2..  can i remove all rows that all like or contain "my_row" ?
[06:55:53] <cbobo> AdvoWork: you can do that with an .each as u loop though the array
[06:56:43] <erichynds> AdvoWork: write a selector that matches those elements, then call .remove() on it
[06:56:50] <Bartzy|work> erichynds: I found out what's the issue. I get var1 from a function that does an ajax call. in the success callback, it returns the array (I did async: false), but I think the 'return' in success doesn't return the function, but only the 'success' function callback. How can I return from within 'success: function(data) {}' the value of the parent function ?
[06:57:08] <erichynds> right, you can't do that
[06:57:18] <erichynds> first, set async back to true
[06:57:30] <erichynds> second, do anything that depends on the ajax response inside the success handler
[06:57:41] <erichynds> ?async
[06:57:41] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[06:58:59] <AdvoWork> erichynds, like $("tr:contains('new_sort_row_')").remove();?
[06:59:31] <erichynds> console.log that and see what elements it matches, if any
[06:59:35] <nail_> heh, "your entire web site to lock up"
[06:59:39] <erichynds> dunno if that'll work. may need to be td instead of tr
[07:01:17] <Taftse|Work> ?async
[07:01:17] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up.

[07:01:26] <Taftse|Work> async
[07:01:42] <Taftse|Work> bot-t,
[07:02:26] <z3yo> I've data in database, I want to get datas with ajax and display that in <ul> list, What can I use ?
[07:02:35] <z3yo> $.ajax with post ?
[07:02:41] <z3yo> Or JSon is better ???
[07:02:52] <Raverix> ...
[07:02:58] <Aamir> ?get@z3yo
[07:02:59] <bot-t> z3yo, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:03:03] <Aamir> opps
[07:03:15] <Aamir> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[07:03:37] <xec> z3yo: youre missing a step i think? you cant query a database directly with javascript
[07:04:01] <z3yo> xec right
[07:04:13] <Bartzy|work> How can I set a default value for a function argument ?
[07:05:07] <erichynds> Bartzy|work: unless the argument is a boolean, foo = foo || "default";
[07:05:10] <z3yo> Aamir, My problem is more with data display
[07:05:18] <Bartzy|work> erichynds: And if it's a boolean ?
[07:05:39] <erichynds> foo === undefined ? true : foo
[07:05:44] <erichynds> true being the default
[07:05:52] <xec> z3yo:  the usual approach is to have a server side script do the query and return the results to you (formatted in xml, html or json)
[07:06:20] <xec> z3yo: so, you could use $.ajax and post and get json
[07:06:47] <z3yo> Html or Json ? What's better ?
[07:07:44] <z3yo> I want display my datas with <ul> list
[07:07:45] <PERECil_> z3yo: mustard or ketchup?
[07:07:48] <xec> personal preference really, json can be easier to work with if you're doing something with the data on client side - if you just wanna dump it out on the page, html would be easier
[07:07:59] <z3yo> Lol PERECil_
[07:08:03] <Aamir> z3yo: try json :)
[07:08:31] <PERECil_> z3yo: it all depends. I usse JSON when needing to export it as an API for third parties, elsewhere I use html
[07:08:45] <PERECil_> it's less work for the client to render the html server side
[07:08:54] <z3yo> Hmm ok I think I'm gonna use html
[07:10:06] <Anitox> hallo!
[07:11:12] <lathan> ?hi @ Anitox
[07:11:12] <bot-t> Hey Anitox
[07:11:40] <Anitox> I'm having an issue with .getJSON() not calling the return function once the request is completed.  I have .ajaxError() set to show something in the console when there is an error, and it happens with the .getJSON() call.  However, when I look at the JSON data in the console, it appears correct.
[07:11:46] <Anitox> Anyone know what it might be doing?
[07:12:08] <Anitox> Or perhaps there are some common things that could cause it to fail?
[07:13:19] <Aamir> Anitox:  make sure the response is json. e.g if you are using php than you should json_encode()
[07:13:29] <erichynds> run the response through jsonlint.com
[07:14:25] <Patatouf> i am sorry to this question here, but is there someone using doctrine ?
[07:20:39] <Anitox> Awesome. Thanks for the help guys. I found the error.
[07:21:11] <ericincoldohio> does val() get the text displayed on a button?
[07:21:29] <Aamir> Patatouf:  ask on #php
[07:22:08] <Patatouf> Aamir, ok :)
[07:22:24] <systemfault> Haha
[07:22:28] <Taftse|Work> ?
[07:22:33] <systemfault> Even on #PHP, frameworks are offtopic.
[07:22:46] <Taftse|Work> ok
[07:22:54] <systemfault> There's a symfony channel I think, that might be helpful :/
[07:23:03] <cybertronxy> thats if you can enter the channel
[07:23:04] <cybertronxy> lol
[07:23:10] <systemfault> Perhaps even a doctrine channel, haven't tried
[07:23:29] <Taftse|Work> well or try a really great framework and channel #codeigniter :P
[07:23:54] <mbrevda> why does $('.alt_table > tbody:last').find('tr:last') return the last tr at document ready and not the actual latest (i.e. if a row has been added since)
[07:24:01] <BlackAnt> hmm
[07:24:27] <systemfault> mbrevda: Because... it's like that :/
[07:24:47] <BlackAnt> s
[07:24:49] <mbrevda> systemfault: meaning? is there a bug? Am I using the wrong selector?
[07:25:01] <systemfault> mbrevda: It's normal.
[07:25:14] <systemfault> mbrevda: You must "reselect"
[07:25:25] <mbrevda> how?
[07:25:38] <systemfault> mbrevda: By doing the same thing :/
[07:25:43] <mbrevda> (im doing this in a function - should it be run every time the function is run?)
[07:26:09] <systemfault> mbrevda: If the node can be different, sure.
[07:26:18] <systemfault> (As it seems to be)
[07:27:13] <mbrevda> erm - you lost me somewhere between "thats the way it works" and "just do the same thing again"
[07:27:17] <systemfault> mbrevda: What $('.alt_table > tbody:last').find('tr:last') does is returning references to nodes.
[07:27:43] <mbrevda> ok, now if I run that in a function, shouldt it return fresh data (i.e. the CURRENT last tr) every time?
[07:27:53] <systemfault> Yes
[07:28:03] <mbrevda> and yet it isnt!
[07:28:19] <systemfault> well, write a small test so we can actually see the problem :(
[07:28:22] <mbrevda> if I add a row, it still points to what WAS last, not was is currently last
[07:28:27] <mbrevda> ok
[07:33:11] <nail_> maybe you are not inserting your rows inside the tbody?
[07:34:40] <Greed> Does anyone see why this wouldn't change the content of #messages?
[07:34:42] <Greed> http://pastie.org/2106551
[07:34:58] <Greed> The json request succeeds, but it returns nothing.
[07:36:00] <z3yo> Is there a "big" difference between get and post using ajax ?
[07:37:25] <Greed> Not really, z3yo
[07:37:32] <Greed> Just a difference in the maximum data you can send
[07:37:36] <lathan> z3yo, yes, in GET the data is sent on the url query string, and has a limit of 1024 or 2048 characters. POST data is sent in the main body and has no limit
[07:38:32] <ericincoldohio> I have a question with the next() functino...I have a link wrapped in a div tag...I want to find the next button, but its in another div after the current div is closed..it doesn't look like it's finding it
[07:39:25] <lathan> z3yo, POST was designed for submitting data back to the server, GET was designed for getting data from the server
[07:39:26] <lathan> z3yo, besides that data limitation it doesn't matter, do what makes sense to you
[07:39:39] <ericincoldohio> do I need to do something like $(this).parent.next('yada');
[07:40:09] <lathan> ?next
[07:40:09] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[07:40:55] <ericincoldohio> sibling = in the same div wrapper?

[07:43:37] <lathan> erichynds, hey
[07:43:39] <ericincoldohio> i wouldn't accept it either...at least not immediately
[07:43:45] <lathan> now what are you going to do about it? :)

[07:44:06] <lathan> free stuff ^
[07:44:20] <ericincoldohio> cop out
[07:44:20] <mbrevda> systemfault: seems I was adding td's not a proper tr. Shouldnt this return the entire tr?! $('#ivr_entries > tbody:last').find('tr:last').html()
[07:44:41] * lathan nods
[07:44:57] <lathan> mbrevda, .html() is innerHTML
[07:44:58] <systemfault> mbrevda: It returns html. :/
[07:45:09] <mbrevda> ah, live and learn!
[07:45:16] <mbrevda> is there anything for outer html?
[07:45:21] <lathan> only in ie
[07:45:28] <lathan> just don't go there

[07:49:39] <SkiOne> Hi, I have a div with a class and I want to get the id of an element that is clicked that is inside the div
[07:50:08] <lessless> hi! is it possible to bypass a chrome script caching or every time i change js file i must cleare cache for changes to take place ?
[07:50:22] <lathan> ericincoldohio, $('a:contains(m here)').parent().nextSibling()
[07:51:01] <lathan> ?delegate @ SkiOne
[07:51:01] <bot-t> SkiOne, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:51:17] <lathan> $('div.class').delegate('a','click',function(){....}) @ SkiOne
[07:51:36] <lathan> lessless, try ctrl-shift-r (sry....)
[07:52:43] <SkiOne> what I have is this $('.last').livequery('click',function(e) {}, the div surrounds a select but the id of the select will not be known. I need to get the id of the select so I can check if the vaule changes. Will delegate help with this?
[07:53:46] <lathan> sry SkiOne i haven't worked with livequery
[07:54:43] <SkiOne> its the same as if it were a regular click it just allows it to act on elements that have been dynamically added to the page
[07:55:04] <SkiOne> ancestor allows me to get the parent id, can I get the next nearest child?
[07:55:44] <erichynds> ditch livequery and use delegate
[07:55:54] <aaronmcadam> +1
[07:55:58] <SkiOne> yeah thats a big deal
[07:56:01] <erichynds> then do $(this).find('select').attr('id')
[07:56:03] <SkiOne> tons of lines of code
[07:56:05] <erichynds> no
[07:56:08] <erichynds> it's 1 line
[07:56:16] <SkiOne> yeah in tons of files
[07:56:20] <erichynds> or use live() instead of livequery()
[07:56:21] <aaronmcadam> it's much easier to use once u understand it
[07:56:25] <SkiOne> my software is alsmot 1 million lines of code
[07:56:34] <systemfault> OMG!
[07:56:34] <aaronmcadam> hah
[07:56:38] <erichynds> lolol
[07:56:43] <systemfault> Is that over 9000?
[07:56:50] <aaronmcadam> on one of the projects I'm on there's 1700 lines in the source :S
[07:57:16] <Ramosa> I have a DOM array of li elements, where I want to get a jQuery of the SPAN's of each li. $(el[0].span) and $(el[1].span) I can get.. but how do I put them into ONE jQuery object? $(el.find('span')) no can do, help!
[07:57:41] <ajpiano> Ramosa $(arrayofelems).find("span")
[07:57:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:57:56] <Ramosa> that returns undefined, and it drives me crazy
[07:58:12] <aaronmcadam> hey ajpiano, every day I check for new yayQueries :( hehe
[07:58:40] <Ramosa> actually it returns [ ]
[07:59:09] <aaronmcadam> ?jsfiddle @ Ramosa
[07:59:09] <bot-t> Ramosa, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[07:59:12] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam, ambitious :)
[07:59:21] <aaronmcadam> hehe :D u guys must be too busy!
[07:59:22] <Ramosa> $('li span') works fine.. but I only want the li span's that are children of a specific li
[07:59:49] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, is there a jq mobile doc repo?
[08:00:00] <Ramosa> aaronmcadam, i just explained my problem here :(
[08:00:15] <ajpiano> not sure, i do believe they are working on jquerymobile-docs - ask in #jquerymobile-dev
[08:00:24] <aaronmcadam> i mean if you whack together an example of what u want we can show you
[08:00:33] <ajpiano> Ramosa, your explanation lacks sufficient detail - a live demo is much more likely to get you to the answer
[08:00:52] <Ramosa> but my code is very fragmented, I cant just isolate this piece :(
[08:00:58] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way in iframe to choose the location of the website inside the iframe?
[08:01:04] <BlackAnt> js mobile hmm
[08:01:07] <Tomashe> lets say i want to go 200px from the top
[08:01:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah but if you make up an example of what you want, Ramosa, it's easier
[08:01:32] <BlackAnt> scrollTo
[08:01:34] <timemachine3030> Ramosa, we need more context about your lists and spans to find a suitable selector to capture just want you want.
[08:01:56] <Tomashe> and without jqueyr?
[08:02:07] <BlackAnt> see ?scrollTo @ Tomashe
[08:02:08] <bot-t> BlackAnt, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[08:02:23] <Ramosa> but isn't it strange that I can get what I need using $(el[0].span) and $(el[1].span) but $(el).find('span') returns [ ] ?
[08:02:26] <aaronmcadam> Tomashe, WITHOUT jQuery??? are you crazy?! :p
[08:02:37] <systemfault> Tomashe: Unless the iframe is on the same domain, you have no control.
[08:02:51] <systemfault> (The website in the iframe)
[08:02:58] <aaronmcadam> hang on Ramosa
[08:03:05] <aaronmcadam> is the span inside the el?
[08:03:15] <Ramosa> according to firebug yes
[08:03:32] <Ramosa> el is a li
[08:03:34] <Tomashe> i c
[08:03:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:03:36] <timemachine3030> el[0].span is an el with a class of "span"
[08:03:41] <Tomashe> ok so scroll to is the solution
[08:03:42] <Tomashe> ty
[08:03:52] <aaronmcadam> no, span would be a property of the el
[08:03:58] <aaronmcadam> it's unwrapped with the sub
[08:04:02] <Tomashe> how do i do scrollto to an iframe with scrolling="no"
[08:04:15] <Ramosa> aaronmcadam, span is right below the object in firebug, has a plus sign next to it
[08:04:17] <innociv> Is therea plugin out there that "highlights" an element by fading everything behind it, sort of turning the element into a modal?
[08:04:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:04:59] <Ramosa> how do I get a jquery object with them all then? el.childList selects the li objects for me fine.. I also tried .each solutions
[08:05:03] <Ramosa> but I need a single jQuery object
[08:05:15] <timemachine3030> opps.. I missed the lack of quotes.
[08:05:18] <aaronmcadam> k one sec
[08:05:58] <Ramosa> i spent days on this, I ask as last resort :-p
[08:06:13] <zamba> in firefox, how can i simulate clicking a set of buttons on a web page?
[08:06:25] <zamba> to launch a bunch of javascript actions
[08:06:31] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/Pqg8x/
[08:06:34] <aaronmcadam> Ramosa
[08:06:58] <aaronmcadam> zamba
[08:07:14] <zamba> aaronmcadam: huh?
[08:07:47] <aaronmcadam> try using iMacros for front end testing
[08:07:49] <aaronmcadam> or selenium
[08:08:02] <erichynds> Ramosa: works for me.. http://jsfiddle.net/4y3Rq/
[08:08:15] <zamba> http://nrk.no/hurtigruten/ <- this is the web page.. there's a chat box there.. the chat log has been collapsed, so i want to expand every entry.. every click on an expand button will yield an ajax request which will populate the box further
[08:08:23] <Ramosa> aaron, yes but here you start off with a jQuery object.. I have the li as a DOM object to start with.. besides I can't get jsfiddle working with firebug
[08:08:43] <danheberden> and Ramosa - if you have a 'span' element, it won't have .span as a property
[08:08:48] <aaronmcadam> why do u have it as a dom obj?
[08:08:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah u can
[08:09:10] <danheberden> Ramosa you didn't look at erichynds's example very carefully, did you
[08:09:23] <Ramosa> because it's given by an event.. I use dynatree jQuery plugin.. and when I lazy expand (ajax) a node, I get the expanded node as parameter
[08:09:31] <Ramosa> then I want to access the span's of all the newly added li's
[08:09:52] <aaronmcadam> and what's the wrapped set giving you
[08:10:03] <aaronmcadam> if u log it out?
[08:10:51] <Ramosa> [DynaTreeNode1..., DynaTreeNode2]
[08:10:51] <antihero> anyone know what they're doing with CKEditor? I know it's a long shot in here but there support is non-existent
[08:11:03] <Ramosa> each has a span
[08:11:08] <Tomashe> how do i scroll inside the iframe $('.IFRAME').scrollTo(1000);
[08:11:10] <Tomashe> this is not working
[08:11:17] <Ramosa> and I get my result with $(el[0].span)
[08:11:26] <Ramosa> but $(el).find('span') returns [ ]
[08:11:37] <erichynds> a dynatreenode is not a DOM node
[08:11:44] <aaronmcadam> bingo
[08:11:56] <Ramosa> its jquery?
[08:12:06] <aaronmcadam> if it has it's own properties
[08:12:28] <Ramosa> it has plenty of properties
[08:12:33] <erichynds> no, it's some object created specifically by that plugin
[08:12:39] <Ramosa> ahh, yes!
[08:12:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:12:55] <Ramosa> well it is a jQuery plugin
[08:13:08] <aaronmcadam> does it not provide callbacks or something
[08:13:11] <Tomashe> anyone mind helkp me ?
[08:13:15] <Ramosa> so how do I fetch a set of these spans then?
[08:13:24] <d3str0y> I wrote some AJAX/JQuery to dynamically load content and preserve back/forwards functionality and bookmarking. I'm having a problem though because my hrefs are href="?page=example" and if you go to the url http://www.example.com/example/ it is not redirecting the directory to /index.php
[08:13:36] <d3str0y> in order for my ajax to work correctly I need to have the /index.php as part of the url
[08:13:52] <d3str0y> mostly you read about people wanting to use htaccess to remove the /index.php but in my case I need to add it
[08:13:54] <erichynds> Ramosa: you'll either need to .map over it and return them yourself, or see if that plugin has an API that'll return them from the object
[08:14:32] <aaronmcadam> yep it's bound to have some callbacks surely
[08:14:41] <d3str0y> so if the website goes to http://www.example.com/example/ and you click a link it will load http://www.example.com/example/?page=example and it will never load correctly
[08:14:53] <systemfault> Ramosa: What do you want to do?
[08:15:14] <Ramosa> www.wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html
[08:15:15] <aaronmcadam> d3str0y, looks like you need it to go to "/page?..."
[08:15:23] <Ramosa> systemfault, again? :-p
[08:15:28] <systemfault> Hmm :/
[08:15:30] <aaronmcadam> make sure you're not just going to "page?..." because that will be relative
[08:15:35] <systemfault> I'll scroll up :P
[08:15:45] <d3str0y> aaronmcadam it it adds a # to the url for the ajax
[08:15:52] <aaronmcadam> which is what looks like is happening
[08:16:07] <d3str0y> so its actually http://www.example.com/example/index.php#?page=example
[08:16:12] <d3str0y> that would load the content correctly
[08:16:13] <BlackAnt> I wish I can connect to two servers from my client
[08:16:18] <aaronmcadam> right
[08:16:23] <BlackAnt> or more than two
[08:16:36] <d3str0y> I just need to figure out how to make http://ww.example.com/example/ redirect to example/index.php
[08:16:39] <BlackAnt> I know. I mean from a single client
[08:16:46] <BlackAnt> :p
[08:16:55] <aaronmcadam> htaccess?
[08:17:12] <BlackAnt> htacess url rewrite
[08:17:14] <Ramosa> systemfault, basically im using wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/sample-contextmenu.html
[08:17:17] <aaronmcadam> BlackAnt, you tried something like YQL?
[08:17:30] <BlackAnt> No bro, have'nt yet.
[08:17:35] <aaronmcadam> it's piss simple really
[08:17:38] <Tomashe> guys how do i scrollTo inside an iframe
[08:17:49] <aaronmcadam> need a link to a tut?
[08:17:54] <BlackAnt> see scrollTo
[08:17:56] <Ramosa> systemfault, the api has no event to notify of newly added lazy read nodes.. so I have to loop through all nodes each time I expand one.. I want a unique context menu for inner nodes
[08:18:32] <Null_> d3str0y: whats your javascript for handling the #'s look like?
[08:18:44] <ch3mical> Can anyone tell me why jqm 1.0b1 looks super tiny on iPhone/Android?
[08:18:52] <Ramosa> systemfault, bindContextMenu gets the node from node.appendAjax... success: function(node)
[08:19:03] <Ramosa> which is the node you just expanded
[08:19:11] <d3str0y> complicated, its jquery and ajax
[08:19:22] <d3str0y> my default a directory is supposed to redirect to /index.html or /index.php
[08:19:31] <d3str0y> but I think I have some other htaccess that is in conflict
[08:19:34] <aaronmcadam> BlackAnt, I'm not sure what u actually want to do, but have a look at this: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-cross-domain-ajax-request-with-yql-and-jquery/
[08:19:43] <Greed> http://pastie.org/2106551
[08:19:49] <Greed> Why is this not changed #messages?
[08:19:53] <d3str0y> without the index.php its not going to load the content correctly
[08:19:55] <Greed> *changing
[08:20:04] <BlackAnt> aaronmcadam Im not trying to do someting inside jQuery.
[08:20:19] <aaronmcadam> do you mean on your server?
[08:20:21] <BlackAnt> aaronmcadam Just want to connect to multiple servers from an mirc client
[08:20:23] <d3str0y> and im sure there is a way that with htaccess you could also do clean urls/pretty urls or whatever but I dont know how to write htaccess at all
[08:20:25] <Tomashe> aaronmcadam: what do you think?
[08:20:25] <aaronmcadam> ah
[08:20:29] <BlackAnt> my server. nah
[08:20:30] <aaronmcadam> what language are u using BlackAnt
[08:20:31] <Null_> heh, I'm actually asking as I can't get my own # solution going atm :)
[08:20:40] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[08:20:43] <BlackAnt> It suppose to be simple commands
[08:20:47] <BlackAnt> but its not valid
[08:20:52] <Ramosa> also .. $('span.dynatree-node') selects all span's that are children of node li's .. but once I have a specific li node object, I can't extract the span's below it's li's
[08:21:02] <Ramosa> oh.. i give up
[08:21:05] <Null_> works great on original link items, but not on links within the content loaded via ajax
[08:21:06] <aaronmcadam> I'm using XChat BlackAnt looks like you can
[08:21:18] <aaronmcadam> sorry Tomashe what's up?
[08:21:19] <BlackAnt> when Im on BT I will..
[08:21:39] <BlackAnt> aaronmcadam I use Xchat when Im on linux, but right now in windows.. :)
[08:21:45] <aaronmcadam> ahh right dude
[08:21:50] <Ramosa> can't have a conversation in a 908 user channel :-p
[08:21:53] <aaronmcadam> I use chatzilla on windows
[08:21:56] <BlackAnt> that should work.
[08:22:06] <BlackAnt> Im on noname script
[08:22:44] <aaronmcadam> Tomashe, what was it?
[08:22:52] <has1>  /j #webdesign
[08:22:55] <has1> oops
[08:23:06] <BlackAnt> uahaha
[08:23:14] <aaronmcadam> hah bloody designers :P
[08:23:55] <BlaDe^> can I do liek $('.class is:(visible)').each(....) ?
[08:24:05] <aaronmcadam> no reason why not
[08:24:13] <BlaDe^> is that the correct selector?
[08:24:15] <erichynds> .class:visible
[08:24:24] <Anitox> $('.class:visible').each()
[08:24:30] <BlaDe^> thanks
[08:25:26] <d3str0y> oh Null_ just read what you typed your working with ajax too?
[08:26:05] <z3yo> Is there not a problem : $(this).parent().chidren("#name").val(); ??
[08:26:35] <aaronmcadam> z3yo, doesn't really make sense
[08:26:51] <aaronmcadam> you'd want to do an each on that and inside the function call $(this).val()
[08:27:07] <z3yo> Omg
[08:27:11] <BlackAnt> $(this).parent().parent().animate makes sense
[08:27:26] <aaronmcadam> think about it, it's a set/array you're returning there
[08:27:51] <z3yo> missing sleep
[08:27:51] <BlackAnt> while write bunch of shits when u call just var $ss = $('#name').val() ??
[08:28:00] <z3yo> x)
[08:28:16] <aaronmcadam> haha
[08:28:29] <aaronmcadam> he must want a dynamic list
[08:28:39] <BlackAnt> perhaps
[08:28:47] <BlackAnt> jQuery = write less do more
[08:28:51] <aaronmcadam> otherwise his tiredness has fooked him
[08:29:31] <aaronmcadam> and i'd say you want $(this).closest('#name') there z3yo
[08:29:47] <BlackAnt> or he can use .find
[08:29:50] <d3str0y> where can I go to ask questions about .HTACCESS?
[08:29:55] <z3yo> aaronmcadam, I 've 3 element <input>
[08:29:57] <Null_> having problems where I load content via ajax with .load() from my main menu, but when I want to click a link within that ajax-loaded content, its not being loaded via ajax.  http://jsfiddle.net/n8Eg3/
[08:30:00] <BlackAnt> ##PHP
[08:30:01] <BlackAnt> invite only
[08:30:04] <z3yo> My event is on the third
[08:30:12] <BlackAnt> or just ask
[08:30:18] <kborchers> z3yo: wouldn't it be a little more efficient to do $(this).siblings("#name") rather than $(this).parent().children("#name")?
[08:30:36] <z3yo> siblings oO never seen
[08:30:48] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[08:31:50] <Greed> Why doesn't this work?
[08:31:51] <Greed> http://jsfiddle.net/hgmuq/
[08:32:07] <z3yo> I learn every day
[08:32:13] <BlackAnt> everyone
[08:33:03] <kborchers> Greed: you don't have the jQuery library included in that fiddle
[08:33:07] <Tomashe> anyone got exeriance with scrollto
[08:33:20] <Greed> Whoops.
[08:33:24] <Greed> Thanks, kborchers
[08:33:56] <z3yo> siblings don't work
[08:34:30] <ericbarnes> I am trying to use delegate with a custom function. But only to basically rebind instead of a click event. Any idea why this isn't correct? - http://pastebin.com/Q3T13a1d
[08:34:31] <erichynds> Greed: also, messages remains hidden the whole time
[08:34:32] <z3yo> Oh no, it's mme
[08:34:36] <z3yo> That's works
[08:35:46] <z3yo> Thx kborchers ;) siblings works
[08:35:53] <kborchers> no prob
[08:35:59] <z3yo> ;)
[08:37:33] <VictorCL2> how can I optimize this = $tableScope.find("tr").eq(i).children().eq(a);   .. I need to get whats inside a specific td
[08:44:20] <BlackAnt> VictorCL2 in between? <td>this_text_is_what_i_wana_get</td>?
[08:44:47] <Urbenkeach> Hi guys, quick question. I have two jQuery objects, and need to perform the same actions to both objects. Anyway to select both objects, without duplicated the code?
[08:45:11] <lathan> VictorCL2, $tableScope.find('tr:eq(' + i + ')' > :eq(' + a + ')');
[08:45:13] <VictorCL2> yes
[08:45:24] <ajpiano> Urbenkeach: firstobj.add(secondobj).doSomething();
[08:45:26] <BlackAnt> A longer approach
[08:45:28] <BlackAnt> http://jsfiddle.net/553ma/3/
[08:45:30] <lathan> VictorCL2, is there some content your looking for?
[08:45:31] <BlackAnt> might be useful
[08:45:37] <BlackAnt> @ VictorCL2
[08:45:41] <lathan> hey ajpiano
[08:45:57] <VictorCL2> yes inside the <td> I need to check if there is a div call div with class event
[08:45:59] <VictorCL2> div.event
[08:46:20] <BlackAnt> check the link I posted
[08:46:28] <ajpiano> heya lathan
[08:46:51] <egrouse> im having some issues getting a page with .get(), the console keeps reporting 404 yet i can see the page in my browser
[08:46:53] <lathan> ajpiano, it seems that I get lost for a month or two, then come back :P
[08:46:58] <egrouse> if i try to visit the url myself
[08:47:00] <ajpiano> heh
[08:47:03] <Urbenkeach> excellent, than you ajpiano :)
[08:47:13] <egrouse> is there a different between how jquery/js sees a site to how a normal user would see it
[08:47:20] <egrouse> i cant understand why one can access it and not hte other
[08:47:21] <lathan> egrouse, the user agent....
[08:47:30] <lathan> egrouse, is it cross domain?
[08:47:37] <egrouse> no, local
[08:47:42] <egrouse> well, same domain
[08:47:46] <lathan> subdomain?
[08:47:54] <egrouse> both on the same one
[08:47:59] <lathan> www.google.com can't ajax to 'api.google.com'
[08:48:13] <egrouse> aye im aware of the protection stuff
[08:48:36] <BlackAnt> is it really true that search engines does'nt see ajax contents?
[08:48:50] <egrouse> yes
[08:48:58] <egrouse> search engines dont run javascript
[08:50:41] <keybo> how do i select all the selects on a page?
[08:50:46] <chovy> egrouse: yes they do.
[08:51:28] <BlackAnt> chovy: How do google analytics work? why the ga.js?
[08:51:43] <innociv> To send data to google...........
[08:51:51] <innociv> It's not magic
[08:51:53] <BlackAnt> is that data readable?
[08:52:05] <innociv> That's what it's for
[08:52:06] <BlackAnt> by robots?
[08:52:19] <innociv> no robots don't read the ga.js
[08:52:20] <innociv> ....
[08:52:29] <BlackAnt> how is it sent?
[08:52:32] <systemfault> ga.js if for users :/
[08:52:34] <BlackAnt> how is the data sent?
[08:52:37] <systemfault> *is for
[08:52:39] <Bittarman> BlackAnt, with magic
[08:52:52] <BlackAnt> interesting
[08:53:01] <systemfault> BlackAnt: Magic.. literally.. open the file. It tries a lot a ways to circumvent the SOP.
[08:53:12] <chovy> google spiders can read js.
[08:53:22] <egrouse> they can read it
[08:53:24] <egrouse> do they execute it
[08:53:33] <chovy> of course.
[08:53:44] <keybo> how do i select all the selects on a page?
[08:53:44] <chovy> they've been able to interpret js for like 10 years now.
[08:53:49] <BlackAnt> systemfault will look into it
[08:54:00] <egrouse> so why did they release docs on how to make your ajax pages searchable by google
[08:54:08] <BlackAnt> lol
[08:54:10] <egrouse> including a dodgy hack where they replace #! with a string
[08:54:12] <egrouse> seems pointless
[08:54:18] <egrouse> if they can execute it themselves
[08:54:18] <Bittarman> google won't index anything that you load with js onto your page unless theres a non-script method to get it.
[08:54:28] <Bittarman> they don't execute it themselves
[08:54:30] <BlackAnt> I think they read it
[08:54:34] <chovy> Bittarman: that's not true.
[08:54:37] <silo> I have a submit button that I am triggering an event.preventDefault(); on - it prevents the submit in chrome, but in IE/FF it doesn't. No JS errors in the debug window - Anyone have any idea why this might happen?
[08:54:38] <BlackAnt> though docs said they dont
[08:54:42] <Bittarman> you have to provide the alternate content just like you would not non-script people
[08:54:42] <jeffsmykil> What does this mean?  context.sourceCache is undefined
[08:55:09] <keybo> are you using submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault() });?
[08:55:15] <chovy> silo: how are you triggering it.
[08:56:10] <Bittarman> chovy, wtf? they require you to use links in the hashbang/shebang format for a reason!
[08:56:26] <BlackAnt> systemfault by SOP what do you mean? SOAP? it cant be
[08:56:30] <Bittarman> that way, google will turn them into query string params instead, and send that up to your server,
[08:56:38] <Bittarman> so you provide the alternate content.
[08:56:39] <silo> chovy: $("#submit").click(function(){
[08:57:04] <chovy> $("form").submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[08:57:13] <silo> thanks :)
[08:57:19] <Bittarman> its the same principal as turning all your links to schebangs post-load for non-script users
[08:57:54] <chovy> what's the url for that document Google released?
[08:57:58] <egrouse> i thought that was the case Bittarman
[08:58:18] <Mrfloyd> i m using  $.mobile.changePage to reload a page
[08:58:27] <Bittarman> chovy, just google "google  ajax crawling" @ chovy
[08:58:30] <BlackAnt> they are many gogole docs
[08:58:36] <Mrfloyd> using reload page true
[08:58:37] <BlackAnt> google.
[08:58:43] <Mrfloyd> talking to me
[08:58:44] <Mrfloyd> ?
[08:58:53] <BlackAnt> Nope
[08:58:55] <Mrfloyd> ok
[08:59:02] <BlackAnt> I will call ur nick If I am
[08:59:08] <Mrfloyd> ok
[08:59:19] <Mrfloyd> how do u call someone's nick
[08:59:21] <Bittarman> the alternative to the schebands is exactly the same as what you have to do for no-script browsers, you just make the content gracefully degrade, or upgrade the content for JS viewers
[08:59:23] <Mrfloyd> i am new on mirc
[08:59:30] <Bittarman> upgrading for js viewers is really the better option too.
[08:59:32] <BlackAnt> Eat some candies first
[09:00:29] <Mrfloyd> i m using  $.mobile.changePage to reload a page content, inside this page i am using tmpl() plugin
[09:00:43] <Mrfloyd> the first time i call this page it works
[09:00:47] <Mrfloyd> fine
[09:00:54] <Mrfloyd> the second time it doesnt show anything
[09:01:12] <Mrfloyd> the page reload with no rendered html empty
[09:01:46] <kborchers> Mrfloyd: you might want to try your question on #jquerymobile too
[09:02:16] <Mrfloyd> great
[09:02:19] <dotwired> hi. question to mouseup() event: http://api.jquery.com/mouseup/
[09:02:31] <BlackAnt> w8
[09:02:37] <VictorCL2> this = thisTd.find("div.event");   ... is slowind down IE8 a lot
[09:02:40] <VictorCL2> how can I optimize that?
[09:02:53] <dotwired> if i go to the demo and click the sentence it works great
[09:03:16] <dotwired> but what if i click the sentence, move the mouse away while holding the mouse down and then release?
[09:03:23] <dotwired> then mouseup doesn't work
[09:03:33] <dotwired> is there any event which considers this case?
[09:03:58] <miketaylr> mousedown?
[09:04:00] <BlackAnt> Mrfloyd what happens?
[09:04:15] <Mrfloyd> i asked on jq mobile
[09:04:23] <Mrfloyd> channel but it seems no one is there
[09:04:36] <Mrfloyd> i think it is a bug in the template
[09:04:42] <BlackAnt> Nah
[09:04:43] <BlackAnt> $.mobile.changePage( "../alerts/confirm.html", {transition: "pop", reverse: false, changeHash: false
[09:04:43] <BlackAnt> });
[09:05:08] <Mrfloyd> what is this code for
[09:05:09] <Mrfloyd> ?
[09:05:20] <Mrfloyd> $.mobile.changePage  is working fine
[09:05:27] <Mrfloyd> let me explain what i am doing
[09:05:33] <Mrfloyd> i am new on jq and jqm
[09:05:34] <BlackAnt> changeHash: false
[09:05:45] <Mrfloyd> using it false
[09:05:47] <Mrfloyd> already
[09:05:50] <BlackAnt> Reverse: true
[09:05:57] <Mrfloyd>     $.mobile.changePage( page+".html", {
[09:05:57] <Mrfloyd>     	transition: "slide",
[09:05:57] <Mrfloyd>     	reverse: false,
[09:05:59] <Mrfloyd>     	changeHash: false,
[09:06:01] <Mrfloyd>     	reloadPage: true
[09:06:03] <Mrfloyd>     });
[09:06:04] <Mrfloyd> mm
[09:06:33] <Mrfloyd> i am setting a global variable
[09:06:36] <Mrfloyd> the recaling the page
[09:06:43] <Mrfloyd> and inside the page i am using a tmpl
[09:06:55] <Mrfloyd> so i expect difffernt results
[09:06:57] <BlackAnt> since its not going to track ur history
[09:06:57] <dotwired> nobody wants to help me? =(
[09:07:08] <Mrfloyd> same issue
[09:07:16] <miketaylr> dotwired: mousedown?
[09:07:22] <dotwired> no, mouseup
[09:07:31] <Mrfloyd> the data shows for a while then disapears
[09:07:37] <dotwired> if i just click it's fine, but if i drag the mouse from the element away
[09:07:47] <dotwired> and then release mouseup doesn't fire
[09:07:53] <miketaylr> of course
[09:08:13] <gmepas> jquery ui dialog if height > than viewport, the dialog is positioned at the bottom of the viewpor
[09:08:26] <BlackAnt> Mrfloyd look into http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/methods.html
[09:08:33] <kborchers> dotwired: if you mouseup after you leave the element, why would you expect mouseup to fire? you are not doing a mouseup on the element but somewhere else
[09:08:33] <Mrfloyd> i know this
[09:08:42] <Mrfloyd> i read this url many times
[09:08:48] <Mrfloyd> am i missing something
[09:08:49] <Mrfloyd> ?
[09:09:07] <Mrfloyd> jqmData(), jqmRemoveData(), and jqmHasData() (method)
[09:09:07] <Mrfloyd>     When
[09:09:10] <Mrfloyd> these maybe ?
[09:09:31] <dotwired> yeah, but i still focused on the element (focusout is no solution)
[09:10:03] <dotwired> just try to slide the slider here: http://demo.dotwired.de/bvf1/portfolio
[09:10:12] <systemfault> BlackAnt: Same Origin Policy
[09:10:20] <dotwired> and once release the mouse when youre exactly on the slider toggle
[09:10:32] <dotwired> and once when you're outside of the slider toggle
[09:10:45] <BlackAnt> systemfault in?
[09:10:48] <dotwired> i just inserted a lol alert if mouseup fires.
[09:10:49] <Bittarman> dotwired, your not still focused on the element
[09:10:51] <gmepas>  -> does anyone know if this is a bug: dialog height larger than viewport, the dialog is positioned to the bottom of viewport ---
[09:11:08] <miketaylr> i don't get it, the slider seems to work either way
[09:11:21] <miketaylr> oh, "lol"
[09:11:22] <dotwired> Bittarman: how do you mean :O
[09:12:07] <Bittarman> dotwired, mouseup doesn't consider where the mouse went down, it doesn't consider if the mouse is moving, it only considers if the mouse button was lifted, while the mouse cursor was over that element.
[09:12:48] <kborchers> Bittarman +1 I was just typing similar response
[09:12:48] <Bittarman> and its pretty normal behaviour, most people would expect that if they click down on something, and move away, then no action would be taken when they lift
[09:12:53] <lith> Hey guys, I have just moved to beta of jquery mobile and now no links work. In the success of a loadPage ajax it is appending the new page to the pageContainer, the .appendTo( settings.pageContainer ); is throwing an exception with the message: setting a property that has only a getter
[09:13:36] <kborchers> Bittarman exactly, it's like if you click on a link and then decide not to go there, if you drag off and release, browser doesn't follow link
[09:13:58] <dotwired> yeah, but I would like to follow in this case^^
[09:14:00] <Bittarman> so, if you changed that behaviour, it would be a broken 'user experience'
[09:14:10] <Bittarman> dotwired, err... unlucky :)
[09:14:37] <dotwired> I mean, I want to flip the toggle height back to normal after it has been used
[09:14:40] <Bittarman> you'd have to listen for the mousedown, set a flag, monitor for it leaving the box (mouseout), and listen for the up
[09:14:59] <dotwired> but at the moment this does only work if the user releases the mouse exactly over the element
[09:15:18] <Bittarman> thats what your users would expect to happen too
[09:15:33] <Bustin> Sorry if this is the wrong place, I have a jquery image slider and the accordion on my website. When loading any page or pressing f5 to refresh, it seems the slider images and the accordion are loading slowly and causing a quick flash of all the images in the slider and the accordion initially loading fully expanded for a quick second. Is there anything I can do to fix this? here is my site, thank you http://bit.ly/etn6YT
[09:16:24] <TheIronSky> that's an issue with your images, I believe
[09:16:28] <TheIronSky> not so much your jquery
[09:16:36] <TheIronSky> try adjusting your compression
[09:16:52] <TheIronSky> and saving your images as those fancy PNGs
[09:17:00] <TheIronSky> let me get the specifics for yo
[09:17:02] <TheIronSky> *you
[09:17:25] <Bustin> TheIronSky: even if the images are removed, the right hand navigation loads fully expanded for a quick second - which leads me to think it's something with the jquery
[09:17:33] <Bustin> or, how it's included
[09:18:04] <TheIronSky> Have you tried interlacing your images?
[09:18:17] <dancannon> Hi, Could somebody have a quick look at my code and help me figure out how to make it more efficient? https://gist.github.com/1040456
[09:18:20] <TheIronSky> they load much nicer
[09:18:28] <Bustin> No, I can give that a try
[09:18:52] <keybo> how do i get the value of the checked radio in a named group

[09:19:13] <TheIronSky> Bustin: Also, I don't seem to be seeing the issue when I use my computer, however, it is relatively high-end
[09:19:17] <VictorCL2> some help /  I have this <td><div class="event"></div></td>  .. and I need to get the .html() of this div.event   .. find("div.event") ... seems to be reeallly slow on IE8
[09:19:22] <Mrfloyd> this is the page that i am showing it using changePage
[09:19:30] <Bustin> TheIronSky: press f5, or refresh
[09:19:34] <TheIronSky> Bustin: it could be your server
[09:19:35] <Bustin> and I'm on a high-end PC as well
[09:19:44] <TheIronSky> or your internet connection
[09:19:52] <Mrfloyd> the first time the template shows the second time only the text shows
[09:20:29] <Bustin> No, I'm on a 100MB / s connection, on a high-end PC and the hosting is fine. It's been tested on different connections / PC's
[09:21:04] <kborchers> keybo $("input[name='radioName']:checked")
[09:21:49] <kborchers> keybo sorry $("input[name='radioName']:checked").val()
[09:22:34] <keybo> kborchers: thanks :D
[09:23:20] <TheIronSky> Bustin: I'm going to go ahead and say that interlacing your PNGs will fix it.
[09:24:18] <Bustin> TheIronSky: negative. They're PNG and Interlaced now, still not resolved.
[09:24:22] <TheIronSky> Bustin: I've used that specific plugin before and I've never experienced this issue
[09:24:51] <Bustin> TheIronSky: google easy slider 1.5 preload - other users have had the same issue
[09:24:54] <TheIronSky> what browser are you using?
[09:25:08] <Bustin> FF
[09:25:36] <Bustin> it's happening in IE too.
[09:25:42] <Bustin> browser-wide tbh.
[09:25:49] <TheIronSky> Don't know what to say - I've checked your code and I'm not seeing the problem
[09:26:27] <TheIronSky> checking your CSS right now
[09:27:44] <TheIronSky> Consider changing #slider to a class, and then re-formatting
[09:28:20] <TheIronSky> Also, give div#rotator a specific height
[09:28:30] <TheIronSky> to eliminate the loading bit
[09:28:51] <TheIronSky> that should do the job
[09:29:12] <delinquentme> s.split(",").each(function(index){})  got this  .. where s is a string .. with letters and commas .. id LIKE to run a each function on the values of this string
[09:29:12] <devinrolsen> so, I'm trying to save the current window.location out to a db via ajax, however when I try to put window.location into a variable that gets sent, the page always refreshes..
[09:29:16] <delinquentme> whats wrong here
[09:29:36] <devinrolsen> any way to put window.location into a variable I can use in my ajax data?
[09:30:31] <delinquentme> oh im getting a TypeError s.split(",").each is not a function
[09:31:27] <systemfault> delinquentme: What does .split returns? (An Array) Does Array has .each? (No)
[09:31:38] <bobbobbins> if i have a 1 dimensional json object, how would i access the first piece of data?
[09:31:42] <kborchers> devinrolsen hmmm, have you tried window.location.href?
[09:31:45] <systemfault> You might want $.each
[09:31:49] <delinquentme> OHhhh
[09:31:51] <systemfault> delinquentme: ^^
[09:32:01] <BlackAnt> i need more stuffs about yql :p
[09:32:06] <BlackAnt> *on
[09:32:32] <devinrolsen> kbrochers, I have not, would window.location.href contain both url and hash?
[09:32:39] <devinrolsen> cause that is what I'm after.
[09:32:59] <Bustin> TheIronSky: fixed, was #slider set a hieight and overflow to hidden.
[09:33:01] <Bustin> thank you
[09:33:10] <TheIronSky> no problem
[09:33:38] <devinrolsen> ahh, its does contain both, thanks kbrochers, going to give it a try now.
[09:33:43] <TheIronSky> I had a feeling it wasn't a jQuery problem
[09:33:46] <Bustin> Now if we refresh, the accordion seems to still load after the site loads, which causes a second of showing the accordion expanded, are you seeing this too?
[09:34:23] <ColKurtz> Bustin
[09:34:29] <ColKurtz> can i see
[09:34:30] <kborchers> np, if it doesn't contain, i think you can also use window.location.hash to get the hash too
[09:34:59] <Bustin> ColKurtz: http://bit.ly/etn6YT
[09:35:28] <ColKurtz> i see it
[09:35:41] <ColKurtz> you can set your CSS styles to hide it, instead of using JS to hide it
[09:35:42] <TheIronSky> No, it seems to be loading right for me
[09:35:46] <ColKurtz> and then inside a <noscript>
[09:35:57] <ColKurtz> place a <style> tag with the appropriate styles to display it, for those without JS
[09:36:10] <ColKurtz> if you feel like taking all that extra effort
[09:36:26] <TheIronSky> ColKurtz: you must've missed the conversation we just had
[09:36:39] <ColKurtz> o lol
[09:36:51] <ColKurtz> ya i just got here
[09:36:52] <Bustin> TheIronSky: this is a different issue
[09:36:58] <Bustin> it's regarding the accordion
[09:37:02] <Bustin> on the right
[09:37:38] <delinquentme> "\n" is a line return in text of JS right?
[09:38:01] <ColKurtz> i believe so
[09:38:49] <ColKurtz> yep
[09:39:15] <Bustin> TheIronSky: if you refresh the site / page, you get the accordion not loaded for a split second - so you can see all the accordion items (keep your eye on the right navigation).
[09:39:25] <Bustin> ColKurtz: you can confirm you're seeing that as well?
[09:39:25] <delinquentme> danka!
[09:39:31] <ColKurtz> yes
[09:39:41] <TheIronSky> Bustin: why is that an issue?
[09:40:58] <dotwired> qoute: *you'd have to listen for the mousedown, set a flag, monitor for it leaving the box (mouseout), and listen for the up* concerning the mouseup story
[09:41:17] <dotwired> right, I already was doing this, but it fails on "listen for the up"
[09:41:36] <dotwired> as i simply don't know how to listen to it then, if mouseup wont do it
[09:41:51] <initzero> Does anyone have an opinion on having server-side code (PHP for example) dynamically create JavaScript as output?
[09:41:59] <shichuan> http://twitter.com/#!/SubtleGradient/status/83574323889184769
[09:42:19] <systemfault> initzero: I think it's bad in pretty much every case.
[09:42:44] <Bustin> TheIronSky: well, if you were developing a website which sold products, would you want visitors seeing that? It's not a major issue, but having the site load fluently without having the accordion show fully expanded for a quick second then automatically collapse is something i'd want to have fixed
[09:42:46] <ColKurtz> i've done it sometimes initzero...on a very limited basis
[09:42:48] <Bustin> just me though
[09:43:07] <ColKurtz> but i've only ever heard people say that is terrible practice
[09:43:08] <ColKurtz> lol
[09:43:29] <initzero> It never makes me feel happy, but I don't know how to argue against it
[09:43:48] <ColKurtz> because it gets kinda sloppy
[09:44:09] <ColKurtz> can the bot in here specifically search stackoverflow?
[09:44:23] <ColKurtz> or just jquery docs
[09:44:40] <initzero> I guess the usual workaround is dumping to a hidden "something" or using an AJAX reqeust
[09:44:46] <systemfault> For me, it's simply... HTML = document, CSS = styling, JS = behaviors. PHP produces the HTML, don't mix it with JS.
[09:45:01] <systemfault> It's as bad as mixing HTML + JS
[09:45:19] <Snerf> Anyone notice in Jquery-UI 1.8.13, using a draggable object, and helper:clone , $(ui.helper).attr('id') is undefined, even if it is set ? It works fine in 1.8.11
[09:45:22] <TheIronSky> Bustin: I honestly don't think that people interested in purchasing from an online store are really going to notice that and say "wow, what a terrible website" - most people just think of it as a part of loading
[09:45:41] <TheIronSky> Snerf: I did not notice that
[09:45:42] <systemfault> Ah.. the shitty PHP programmer mindset.
[09:46:08] <systemfault> "As long as it works, right?"
[09:46:14] <initzero> :-)
[09:46:21] <Bustin> TheIronSky: still, it adds to the users experience I would say. If it can be fixed, why not fix it? It's something that seems to be annoying me lol.
[09:46:37] <Bustin> I would just like the site to load fluently, not have the accordion do that
[09:46:43] <TheIronSky> Well, then go for it.
[09:46:44] <Snerf> TheIronSky, well, using 1.8.13 it does not work, it works fine with 1.8.11 (with jquery 1.6.1)
[09:46:59] <Bustin> I'm asking for assistance, because I have no clue why it's even doing that.
[09:47:07] <egrouse> jquery is reporting that something got through a request is a 404, even though it does actually return the data
[09:47:15] <egrouse> is there anyway to make it not think its not there
[09:47:16] <TheIronSky> Bustin: probably another CSS issue
[09:47:19] <ColKurtz> Bustin
[09:47:21] <ColKurtz> I told you how to
[09:47:27] <ColKurtz> with just CSS
[09:49:13] <egrouse> yes i can... sorted my issue
[09:49:18] <egrouse> ta for trying to help earlier
[09:49:43] <geekbuntu> rohit00082002, is this site up somewhere? url? codepaste?
[09:51:13] <Bartzy|work> Hi
[09:51:22] <Bartzy|work> Anyone knows of a complete cross-platform copy-to-clipboard solution ?
[09:51:38] <miketaylr> flash
[09:57:55] <Bustin> ColKurtz: so use CSS to hide the accordion items? or the accordion in entirety, im a bit confused from your explenation, sorry
[09:58:03] <smcguinness> Does anyone have any experience or examples for handling form submission on jQuery mobile (other than the docs)
[09:59:10] <ColKurtz> #accordion div { display:none; }
[09:59:26] <ColKurtz> (which is what the accordion javascript changes it to)
[10:00:16] <ColKurtz> and then, in the head, insert a <noscript><style type="text/css"> #accordion div { display:block; } </style></noscript>
[10:00:36] <ColKurtz> unfortunately the <link> element doesn't seem to work inside of <noscript>
[10:00:41] <Bustin> ah yes, for peolple with js disabled
[10:00:46] <Bustin> works, cool
[10:00:48] <Bustin> ty
[10:00:50] <ColKurtz> it'd be pretty cool to have a nojs.css file
[10:05:48] <hastalavistababy> Hey, I have a problem with the jquery ui slider, basically when setting animation: true , the ui-slider-range and ui-slider-handle elements seem to be positioned in px instead of % (the value seems to be correct but the unit is wrong, the jquery demo uses % and it works just fine)
[10:06:05] <hastalavistababy> here is the demo of the problem: http://projekty.imagomedia.pl/beyond/
[10:06:15] <hastalavistababy> any ideas (please :) )

[10:08:57] <swiggy> or would the one for the specific ID overwrite/
[10:09:07] <nym> Jayflux: this is #jquery, isn't it?
[10:09:57] <kawohi808> how can i check if file has been loaded (using .load() and if not try and reload it?
[10:10:06] <crankharder> anyone familiar with the UI1.9 "menu" widget?  I'm wondering if that is meant to be a right-click menu -- can't really make that out from the existing docs
[10:10:15] <lith> Jayflux: heh jquery uses git i thought
[10:11:05] <hastalavistababy> anyone have any idea about mu ui slider problem see @up
[10:11:37] <hastalavistababy> I debugged the whole thing and haven't got the slightest idea where the problem is

[10:16:25] <jessicaf> how to auto load the pape1 and page2 without having to press the get button? http://pastebin.com/zJ6GCrhD in this
[10:16:50] <lathan> nym, yes, this is #jQuery
[10:17:17] <lathan> hastalavistababy, I see it using the percents...
[10:17:19] <lathan> (on chrome)
[10:18:04] <lathan> hastalavistababy, it also works on firefox
[10:18:12] <hastalavistababy> lathan - first horizontal slider from the left
[10:18:15] <lathan> I see left: 20%
[10:18:23] <lathan> hastalavistababy, the 1.Server?
[10:18:27] <hastalavistababy> yep
[10:18:27] <Snerf> jessicaf, <body onload="get();">
[10:18:37] <lathan> hastalavistababy, left: 42.5531914893617%;
[10:18:46] <lathan> that ain't pixels.....
[10:18:50] <lathan> what browser are you using?
[10:19:02] <hastalavistababy> lathan: after clicking or dragging?
[10:19:18] <lathan> oh
[10:19:20] <lathan> dragging
[10:19:24] <lathan> you didn't mention that
[10:19:48] <hastalavistababy> yeah sorry, forgot - the animation doesn't apply to dragging so I didn't mention it
[10:19:57] <hastalavistababy> but I mean clicking on the first horizontal
[10:21:06] <jessicaf> snerf do i have to change the jquery script too?
[10:21:36] <jessicaf> simply changing the body tag to that doesnt work at all for me
[10:21:53] <Snerf> jessicaf, does running get() not work?
[10:22:10] <jessicaf> no it doesnt
[10:22:33] <jessicaf> but yea if i press the button then it does
[10:22:37] <fabiomcosta> http://mac.github.com/
[10:22:58] <hastalavistababy> lathan: jquery ui 1.6 gives the correct animation but without the range highlight obviously
[10:23:32] <lathan> hastalavistababy, can you put this on jsfiddle? so I can "fiddle", see ?demo
[10:23:32] <bot-t> hastalavistababy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:24:20] <hastalavistababy> lathan - I'll try, the problem is that when I tried to strip it down to very basic stuff it worked fine, but I'll try
[10:24:35] <Snerf> jessicaf, I see, it is because you are sending a POST
[10:25:04] <lathan> hastalavistababy, is it someething to do with the $('#RoundSliderIndicator').Draggable ?
[10:25:13] <lathan> hastalavistababy, that's the only place in your code where you have pixels
[10:25:13] <jessicaf> do i change post to get?
[10:25:41] <lathan> hastalavistababy, you strip it down until it works, then add it back in until it breaks. and find out what breaks it
[10:25:42] <ngharo> Hi, can someone help me find the best way to sort an array of objects -- see: http://jsfiddle.net/hBsx8/
[10:25:45] <bobbobbins> how can i convert a json object to a string?
[10:25:51] <lathan> ?mdc json
[10:25:57] <lathan> ?jsonPARSE @ bobbobbins
[10:26:05] <lathan> oh bot-t......
[10:26:18] <Bwen> I use the function "empty()" on a div which gets added other divs dynamicly. I try to monitor the how much gets entered to empty it after a certain theshold. but the $().length does not seem to be affected by empty() ... ny ideas?
[10:26:30] <bobbobbins> i think its parseJSON
[10:26:44] * lathan nods @ bobbobbins
[10:26:57] <lathan> $.parseJSON("json-string");
[10:27:04] <bobbobbins> but that converts a string to json, i need the other way around
[10:27:16] <hastalavistababy> lathan: no, it doesn't :( RoundSliderIndicator is the round one :(
[10:27:26] <lathan> you want to turn an object into the string?
[10:28:18] <bobbobbins> yeah
[10:29:04] <lathan> bobbobbins, is this for an ajax request?
[10:29:16] <bobbobbins> lathan...yeah, kinda
[10:29:20] <hastalavistababy> lathan: exact same code works on jsfiddle
[10:29:29] <hastalavistababy> maybe some additional js
[10:29:35] <bobbobbins> but not really
[10:29:39] <lathan> bobbobbins, if you put an object into the data field, jQuery will serialize it for you
[10:29:41] <BlackAnt> Something made me feel alive
[10:30:18] <bobbobbins> yeah, but i  already pulled the data out and converted it  to json in my one function...but then somewhere else i need to take that data and print it out as a string
[10:30:31] <lathan> bobbobbins, try $.param(obj)
[10:30:33] <hastalavistababy> lathan: got it!
[10:30:45] <hastalavistababy> lathan: interface elements (http://interface.eyecon.ro) breaks it
[10:31:00] <hastalavistababy> maybe I'll be able to use some new jquery features without it :D
[10:31:38] <lathan> congrats @ hastalavistababy
[10:31:41] <lathan> ?param
[10:31:57] <lathan> who is able to see why bot-t isn't working?
[10:32:00] <bobbobbins> lathan: hmm, that kind of works, but now there are lots of 2%5B%5D type characters in it
[10:32:20] <lathan> bobbobbins, because its encoded for query string..... :(
[10:32:29] <kborchers> lathan not sure why but bot-t left
[10:32:31] <bobbobbins> oh, i see
[10:32:34] <bobbobbins> hmm

[10:36:10] <mythmon> hello again. I am trying to use jquery ui's .switchClass function, with a delay so it animates. I am switching from a class that includes display:none to one that includes display: block. The transition from block -> none is an animation, but the transision from none -> block is just a 0ms switch. Is it possible to get this to be smoother?

[10:46:42] <JethroLarson> I'm writing a fn jquery plugin that has an animation in it. I was thinking about using $.Deferred to make the callback chainable, but I want the return to still be the jQuery collection. Is there a way to do both?
[10:47:27] <nerdshark|work> can someone tell me what the "this" object is, in the context of a mouse event callback?
[10:47:43] <nerdshark|work> is it the mouse object, or is it the element specified by the selector?
[10:47:59] <JethroLarson> @nerdshark in event handlers,
[10:48:12] <JethroLarson> this referrs to the element that it's bound to
[10:48:27] <nerdshark|work> hm
[10:48:43] <BlackAnt> Read throught the funny timeline,
[10:49:02] <e1f> does jquery have an "or" regexp i want to match "#a" or "#b"
[10:49:18] <BlackAnt> bot-t is a bot. Also a human controllable nick
[10:49:25] <ngharo> how to sort an array of objects? anyone? -- see: http://jsfiddle.net/hBsx8/2/
[10:49:27] <BlackAnt> since he has emotions
[10:50:00] <JethroLarson> @blackAnt I don't think so
[10:50:16] <JethroLarson> er that was @e1f
[10:50:20] <rgr> Im looking into using jquery to replace my rather amateurish javascript hacking. Once Q : does it have anythign build in that collects all values in elements named with a  regexp match in order to facilitate creation of, for example, a json record to send back to the server? What keywords or features should I be googling up?
[10:51:04] <e1f> so i guess i should subclass them or something and then match the subclass
[10:51:11] <BlackAnt> @ JethroLarson I make bots. No doubt.
[10:51:35] <lathan> e1f, the comma
[10:51:46] <ajpiano> ngharo var foo = [{val: 34}, {val: 2}, {val: 1}, {val: 100}].sort(function(a,b) { return a.val > b.val  }); ?
[10:52:05] <lathan> e1f, $('#a, #b') will select a #a and a #b
[10:52:07] <JethroLarson> @lathan the comma would be more of an &&
[10:52:21] <lathan> JethroLarson, true, but if used in an .is statement....
[10:52:41] <lathan> e1f, $selection.is('#a, #b')
[10:52:51] <ngharo> ajpiano: you're awesome.  thanks
[10:52:56] <lathan> ^he is
[10:53:01] <e1f> oooh nice. thanks
[10:53:10] <iman_vt> @ngharo https://gist.github.com/352028
[10:53:15] <e1f> let me try taht
[10:53:27] <JethroLarson> if it's ids you can you var el = document.getElementById('a') || document.getElementById('b');
[10:53:28] <JethroLarson> Though I'm not sure that's what you want
[10:53:28] <lathan> e1f, but do be mindful of JethroLarson's warning, if you use it in a selector, it will select both (if they exist)
[10:53:40] <iman_vt> @ngharo would that work for you?
[10:53:41] <lathan> JethroLarson, Blasphemy!!!!!
[10:53:43] <lathan> lol
[10:53:55] <BlackAnt> lol
[10:54:00] <ngharo> iman_vt: dunno, ajpiano's solution works great
[10:54:08] <JethroLarson> oh sorry, var $el = $(document.getElementById('a') || document.getElementById('b'));
[10:55:04] <e1f> oh no, i only want the one that was clicked to be selected
[10:55:10] <JethroLarson> So, anyone have experience with $.Deferred, or do I have to go to StackOverflow?
[10:55:11] * lathan *shudders* @ JethroLarson
[10:55:18] <lathan> ?deferred @ lathan
[10:55:19] <bot-t> lathan, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:55:29] <e1f> well, let me try it and see
[10:56:14] <Jaxidian> Hey all, I've not been following the drama with the jquery 1.5 bugs. Have they been fixed yet? And if so, what was the first solid version that was fixed?
[10:56:43] <ajpiano> Jaxidian: you mean... jquery 1.6 ?
[10:56:46] <ajpiano> JethroLarson: what was your question
[10:56:51] <lathan> Jaxidian, I haven't followed either, but the channel says 1.6.1
[10:57:00] <ajpiano> Jaxidian .. 1.6.1 has been pretty stable ... there's 1.6.2rc1 out right now
[10:57:06] <JethroLarson> @ajpiano I'm writing a fn jquery plugin that has an animation in it. I was thinking about using $.Deferred to make the callback chainable, but I want the return to still be the jQuery collection. Is there a way to do both?
[10:57:09] <ajpiano> with some small fixes
[10:57:11] <Jaxidian> ajpiano: See? Not been following it - getting my version #s screwed up about what broke. ;-)
[10:57:23] <ajpiano> JethroLarson, on jquery 1.6 i think you can get at the promise if you call animate
[10:57:30] <lathan> ?animate
[10:57:30] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:57:35] <ajpiano> you'll be able to call .promise() after having called animate and get it athat was
[10:57:37] <ajpiano> way*
[10:57:59] <lathan> ?promise @ Jaxidian
[10:58:00] <bot-t> Jaxidian, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[10:58:00] <JethroLarson> @ajpiano does the promise include the jQuery collection?
[10:58:35] <ajpiano> no i think it just ... is the promise, i'm not sure
[10:58:39] <ajpiano> you should ask gnarf when he's around
[10:58:42] <ajpiano> or danheberden
[10:58:47] <Jaxidian> ajpiano / lathan: So v1.6 caused the problems and 1.6.1 fixed the problems then, right?
[10:58:56] <ajpiano> Jaxidian: depends what problems you're talking about
[10:59:11] <lathan> the answer for everything not black and white: "it depends"
[10:59:16] <JethroLarson> Oh, looking at the docs, it looks like it has the jQuery object also. I'll try and see
[10:59:17] <ajpiano> 1.5 was ajax fixes that were in turned fixed for 1.5.2, 1.6 was attr/prop fixes that landed in 1.6
[10:59:19] <ajpiano> 1.6.1
[10:59:19] <e1f> it is with some embarrassment that i admit that i only discovered jquery last month (welcome to 2007)
[10:59:28] <lathan> JethroLarson, it looks like deferred just extends itself to the previous object
[10:59:28] <Jaxidian> ajpiano: I thought there were bugs with either ajax and/or validations
[10:59:41] <lathan> e1f, it is okay, you have much to learn padawan
[10:59:44] <ajpiano> there was one very distinct bug with the jquery validate plugin and ajax
[10:59:47] <ajpiano> it is long since resolved
[11:00:10] <Jaxidian> It's those validation/ajax bugs that I'm referring to.
[11:00:18] <Jaxidian> (err, that bug, I guess)
[11:00:26] <ajpiano> well, they're fixed :)
[11:00:38] <Jaxidian> as of 1.6.1?
[11:00:41] <lathan> bot-t: is everybody happy now
[11:00:41] <Jaxidian> (but not before)
[11:00:41] <bot-t> lathan, As I see it, yes.
[11:01:02] <ajpiano> Jaxidian, it was a bug in the validation plugin, not jquery
[11:01:35] <Jaxidian> AHhhhh, okay. Thanks for that clarification. Let me retry google now with better searches. :)
[11:01:44] <Jaxidian> Thanks for the help!
[11:02:10] <e1f> so let's say my $("#a,#b").click is called, can i retrieve the name of the actual div that was clicked?
[11:02:20] <ajpiano> Jaxidian: see docs#8064
[11:02:21] <bot-t> Jaxidian, [#8064] including jquery.validate 1.7 switches ajax call to jsonp (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/8064
[11:02:43] <Jaxidian> ajpiano: Thanks
[11:02:54] <fragileninja> e1f: use $(this)
[11:03:53] <e1f> fragileninja: perfect! it works!
[11:04:21] <lathan> e1f, yah, the context variable this is populated with the native element object, not a jquery collection of the element
[11:05:42] <initzero> Do you guys think it's necessary (or good idea) to do var $this = $(this) if needing to referrence multiple times?
[11:08:03] <KWhat_Work> anyone know of a lite weight ui collapsible tree?
[11:08:57] <lathan> initzero, it is useful if your context might change. I often do: var self = $(this);
[11:09:15] <lathan> initzero, unless you are looping more than 100s of times you won't notice the performance hit.
[11:09:20] <lathan> probably a good practice though....

[11:10:25] <z3yo> Is there a JQuery function to check that a string contains another string ?
[11:10:26] <e1f> does the genius who invented jquery hang out here?
[11:10:55] <z3yo> Or to check an object have the class "blabla" .... ?

[11:11:05] <lathan> z3yo, its in native javascript
[11:11:08] <lathan> oops, not that

[11:11:38] <mattalexx> I have a form on a hotel site that, on submit, is doing the following: use Ajax to post to a server script that parses the variables and returns a complicated URL that represents a page on a thridparty reservation service. Then set window.location.href to take the user there. But now my client wants the page to open in a new tab. Can I do that using jQuery?
[11:11:42] <lathan> ?mdc string.indexof @ z3yo
[11:11:42] <bot-t> z3yo, indexOf - MDC Docs - Returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex , returns -1 if the value is not found. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf
[11:11:54] <z3yo> Contains I think that's it
[11:12:09] <e1f> if i want to know if the background color of the div is a certain color, can i not say: if($(this).css("background") == "#3daf26"){
[11:12:13] <lathan> mattalexx, you can force it to open in a new window, but not a tab
[11:12:18] <lathan> mattalexx, see ?mdc window.open
[11:12:24] <bot-t> mattalexx, window.open - MDC Docs - Creates a new secondary browser window and loads the referenced resource. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.open
[11:12:41] <mattalexx> lathan, Yes, I saw that. Why no new tab? I mean what is really the difference?
[11:12:42] <z3yo> No
[11:13:06] <BlackAnt> interesting question e1f
[11:13:08] <lathan> mattalexx, the tab / new window behavior isn't made available to javascript. it is a user preference
[11:13:11] <z3yo> How to check if an object have a class (and it might have several classes) ?
[11:13:21] <lathan> ?hasClass @ z3yo
[11:13:22] <bot-t> z3yo, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[11:13:44] <z3yo> lathan, ok I gonna test it
[11:13:46] <lathan> z3yo, or .is('.class1.class2.class3, .other1.otherr2')
[11:13:52] <fragileninja> e1f: try checking background-color instead maybe, though im not totally sure
[11:14:11] <lathan> z3yo, you may need to make a custom filter
[11:14:33] <lathan> z3yo, .filter(function(){ return $(this).css('background-color') == "#3daf26"; })
[11:14:38] <mattalexx> hm, or I could not use Ajax and just use target="_blank" on the form.
[11:14:55] <lathan> mattalexx, yes, but that still can't force a new tab vs a new window
[11:15:07] <lathan> form target is better, less popup blockers
[11:15:52] <lathan> you know ajpiano, you are slacking off.... I'm not having to race to answer the questions first... :P
[11:16:07] <ajpiano> in fact, i am the opposite of slacking off ;)
[11:16:35] <BlackAnt> e1f matches two css
[11:16:53] <lathan> ajpiano, oh, I see where we stand...... working?
[11:17:11] <ajpiano> yep
[11:17:26] <e1f> BlackAnt: hmmm?
[11:17:35] <e1f> let me write a small test proggy
[11:17:37] <z3yo> back
[11:18:00] <BlackAnt> specify a variable to have the color value., then compare it
[11:18:07] <danheberden> JethroLarson did you get an answer to your question?
[11:18:17] <danheberden> (saw a highlight)
[11:20:08] <SkiOne> hi, how do I get the id of the first elemeent underneath a div (a form element)?
[11:20:33] <lathan> SkiOne, .children(':first')
[11:20:44] <SkiOne> thx
[11:20:53] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pMZge/show/ <--- can't get .dblclick to trigger for the container .... anyone might know why?
[11:20:55] <SkiOne> someone gave me a selector tutorial I need to go thru it
[11:21:08] <z3yo> I have a class="test1 test2"  and a condition if(  test1 ... is contained in obj.attr(class)  ... how to make it ? :s
[11:21:35] <mekwall> z3yo: .hasClass or .is
[11:21:49] <z3yo> hmmm
[11:22:11] <mekwall> z3yo: ex if ($(elm).hasClass("test1")) { ... }
[11:22:25] <mekwall> or if ($(elm).is('.test1')) { ... }
[11:22:34] <mekwall> but the first one is faster
[11:22:43] <delinquentme> sooo i've got this .. $('[id~=value]')   . what do i do if i want the "value" here to be interpolated ?
[11:23:24] <mekwall> delinquentme: wow... not possible with normal selectors
[11:23:48] <mekwall> delinquentme: starts with, contains, ends with ... only possibilities
[11:24:18] <z3yo> hasClass is not a function ... wtf ?
[11:24:24] <delinquentme> so if i need to select an item whos ID contains the .. value.. or "value"
[11:24:27] <delinquentme> how would i do that :D
[11:24:31] <SkiOne> $(this).children(':first').attr('id'); is return undefined
[11:24:47] <z3yo> gosh
[11:24:57] <mekwall> delinquentme: you just did?
[11:24:59] <JethroLarson> @ajpiano Yeah, you can do something like this
[11:24:59] <JethroLarson> http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/u4SZH/ and dfd.promise(this) will extend the collection with the promise so you can chain normally as well as have promise methods
[11:25:01] <lathan> delinquentme, do you mean if value is a variable?
[11:25:11] <lathan> delinquentme, $('[id~=' + value + ']');
[11:25:14] <mekwall> delinquentme: $('[id~="'+value+'"]')
[11:25:14] <delinquentme> mekwall, lathan correct

[11:28:35] <bot-t> delinquentme, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:28:40] <mekwall> line 6
[11:28:46] <lathan> lol, hide, not change color :P
[11:29:06] <mekwall> lathan: no need for live demo(litions)
[11:29:15] <delinquentme> lol
[11:29:38] <mekwall> his failure is obvious
[11:30:04] <e1f> ok, i wrote a little test proggy http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/jq/plumb/test.html clicking on the blue div is supposed to change it to black
[11:30:09] <ampzamp> mozilla just saw a popcorn.js demo. I'm trying to have video/audio playing WHILE some text is available. wondering if anyone has something obvious that I can handle.
[11:30:12] <mekwall> and no, I'm not his father. but it would've been kinda cool... from a sith point of view
[11:30:17] <e1f> the background-color is being stored in a var (which works)
[11:30:23] <e1f> but the compare is failing
[11:30:24] <ampzamp> urrently using jplayer. love to have text showing while video os playing.
[11:30:31] <delinquentme> silly .. needed ;
[11:31:49] <fragileninja> e1f: jquery is returning the actual rgb string: rgb(255, 17, 17), so change your if statements to check for that rather than the color keyword
[11:32:21] <e1f> oh!
[11:32:42] <e1f> i should have realized that. d'oh
[11:32:58] <e1f> i need some tea
[11:33:51] <lathan> mekwall, well, I posted that demo request before i read your point
[11:33:53] <fragileninja> e1f: haha, it's all good
[11:34:26] <SkiOne> I need to check if a value is equal to a valid us phone # or a valid email address is there an easy way to do this inside an if statement in jquery?
[11:34:30] <lathan> e1f, check for both, not all browsers do that
[11:34:37] <mekwall> lathan: you're new in the game eh? :p
[11:34:44] <mekwall> jumping to conclusions is a bad idea
[11:34:54] <mekwall> anyhow. I need  help as well... http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pMZge/90/ <--- as seen in console log, container is returning the correct element... but .dbclick doesn't work :(
[11:35:03] <lathan> mekwall, no, I'm not new, about 4 years working with jQuery
[11:35:17] <lathan> mekwall, Its better to err on the side of caution
[11:35:31] <lathan> and easier...than to check all browsers to see if they encode the rgb string
[11:36:35] <mekwall> lathan: research > cautiousness :)
[11:37:02] <lathan> that's a philisophical debate just in that one line
[11:37:27] <delinquentme> so you're telling me that $('[id~="'+value+'"]').hide(); shoudl work
[11:37:28] <spiff_no> hi! I did see a nice menu-thingie, I think it was done in jquery, but Im not sure..   on the top of the page there was 200px header, and then a menu bar.. when the page was scrolled down, the menu bar stayed ontop of the screen, I guess it was made a float at a certain point..
[11:37:37] <spiff_no> anyone knows the effect Im after?
[11:37:38] <mekwall> lathan: indeed it is, but no development come from being cautious
[11:37:49] <mekwall> development comes from research :P
[11:37:56] <delinquentme> mekwall, agree dev comes from missile launchers
[11:38:03] <lathan> lol
[11:38:24] <mekwall> missile launchers definately doesn't come from caution :D
[11:40:17] <mekwall> missile launchers killed the discussion
[11:40:22] <mekwall> that's a fact
[11:41:29] * lathan nods
[11:41:58] <phlp> delinquentme: $('[id*="'+value+'"]').hide();
[11:42:00] <SkiOne> I can use regex to solve me issues

[11:42:11] <bot-t> SkiOne, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[11:42:54] <SkiOne> yes that is what I just said
[11:43:00] <SkiOne> expcet I said it like a pirate
[11:43:43] <e1f> lathan: if it works in ie, i'm happy.
[11:44:04] <e1f> pandering to the lowest common denominator
[11:44:06] <lathan> e1f, just about....
[11:44:18] <lathan> webkit: safari and chrome sometimes throw you for a loop
[11:44:47] <lathan> mekwall, "container" isn't attached to the DOM except in the 4th run, and that gives a "container is not defined", http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/pMZge/91/
[11:45:22] <lathan> mekwall, I added a container.parents() to your console log statement
[11:46:23] <mekwall> lathan: I'm not getting an error?
[11:46:53] <lathan> it only gives the error when you doubleclick on the inline code version
[11:47:53] <lathan> in function selectCode, container isn't defined"elm = elm || container[0];"
[11:47:55] <mekwall> lathan: well that's weird
[11:48:01] <lathan> idk...
[11:48:03] <mekwall> ah yeah
[11:48:05] <mekwall> that I know about
[11:48:07] <lathan> I found the bug, you figure it out now
[11:48:19] <lathan> :) I'm working on a job
[11:48:23] <mekwall> lathan: hehe I'll try
[11:49:38] <Hamms> hey all, if I have something bound to an element's click event, is there  a way to make links within that element work normally?
[11:50:35] <ryanneufeld> yes, there is a way
[11:51:00] <Hamms> hooray
[11:51:11] <sean`> hey lathan
[11:51:18] <lathan> hey sean` !
[11:51:20] <sean`> sup homez?
[11:51:31] <lathan> busy busy, summer, busy, ... wait?
[11:52:09] <lathan> Hamms, if($(event.target).is(this)) return true;
[11:52:11] <ColKurtz> $('#element *').not('a').click( function(){ } );
[11:52:16] <ColKurtz> but that feels dirty
[11:52:21] <lathan> ColKurtz, yah, it is
[11:52:23] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:52:25] <lathan> and it doesn't use delegation
[11:52:30] <ColKurtz> lathan is much better
[11:52:31] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:52:39] <Hamms> ooh, awesome
[11:52:41] <Hamms> thank you!
[11:52:43] <lathan> $('#element').click(function(event){......
[11:52:55] <lathan> ?np @ Hamms
[11:52:56] <bot-t> Hamms, No Problem
[11:53:08] <lathan> don't worry, it takes 4 years to be able to come up with that solution in 4 seconds
[11:53:39] <ColKurtz> if $(event.target).is(this)) return true;
[11:53:45] <ColKurtz> the this doesn't refer to the click event?
[11:55:07] <skylamer`> necromancer :D)
[11:55:12] <djquery>  lathan: did you mean a working solution?
[11:55:47] <lathan> djquery, no, concept
[11:55:52] <SimpleAnecdote> Awkward articulation of problem: I am trying to access an inner JSON object using one of the attribute's names as a variable. i.e. j.msg.muhaha.vcColumnType (j = JSON | msg = first item | muhaha = variable containing the proper name of the second item | vcColumnType = third item)
[11:55:57] <lathan> ColKurtz, this refers to the element selected
[11:56:01] <lathan> in the original search
[11:56:04] <lathan> $('#element')
[11:56:13] <ColKurtz> oh
[11:56:22] <ColKurtz> and event refers to the click event then
[11:56:25] * lathan nods
[11:56:35] <ColKurtz> i think i already knew that
[11:56:41] <ColKurtz> #noobinItUp
[11:56:43] <ejo> I was going to have part of my site use a static HTML file for header and borders, then AJAX in the center contents.  So that many "pages" would have a single common header and sidebar(s), with only the center changing instead of full page reloads.  But how do we deal with google indexing in that scenario?
[11:56:44] <lathan> event.target is the element that actually had the event (with event propogation
[11:56:51] <lathan> ColKurtz.noobLevel--;
[11:56:54] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:57:02] <lathan> ejo, you don't
[11:57:13] <lathan> unless you have a serverside code that checks the useragent....(not nice)
[11:57:13] <ejo> lathan: so that's a technique to avoid in domains where indexing is important?
[11:57:20] <ejo> yeah
[11:57:34] <lathan> ejo, ah, you could use frames...*shudder*
[11:57:39] <ejo> ewww
[11:57:40] <lathan> *shudder*
[11:57:46] <lathan> *shudder**shudder*
[11:57:54] <ColKurtz> THOU SHALT NOT SPEAK HIS NAME
[11:57:57] <lathan> ah, a serverside scripting language is a better solution
[11:58:05] <lathan> iframe?
[11:58:07] <lathan> lol
[11:58:24] * ejo cowers
[11:58:30] <lathan> in a corner, plz
[11:58:30] * ColKurtz hides under his desk
[11:58:40] <mekwall> lathan: ah, found the issue... highlight.js replaces the existing element
[11:58:40] <lathan> stick wax in your ears!
[11:58:44] <SimpleAnecdote> ejo: You could set an .htaccess and jQuery to change the items via ajax. Then just submit a sitemap via webmaster tools for assurances ;P
[11:58:46] <lathan> mekwall, ah
[11:58:55] <mekwall> lathan: so I have to reselect it :/
[11:59:01] <lathan> oh well
[11:59:11] <SimpleAnecdote> ejo: or more simply - use php if you have it enabled and just use require or include
[11:59:14] <lathan> ejo, could you ajax in the header and footer?
[11:59:23] <ejo> lathan: I'm all set up for serverside scripting... python-based back end and templating engine.
[11:59:24] <ColKurtz> ejo, you could have it degrade gracefully.
[11:59:25] * SimpleAnecdote doesn't know if it's legal to recommend php in jquery channel
[11:59:27] <lenswipe> DarkHouse, hey
[11:59:36] * ejo is allergic to php, sorry
[11:59:44] <DarkHouse> hey lenswipe
[11:59:46] <kelthar> ejo: so should everyone be
[11:59:49] <SimpleAnecdote> fair enough
[12:00:01] * lathan shares that reaction
[12:00:10] * lathan *cheer*
[12:00:39] <ejo> So it's easy for me to generate all my pages from inheritable templates.  It's not the desire to compose my pages out of modular reusable elements that had me wanting to AJAX in the center content area.  It was just bandwidth efficiency.
[12:00:44] <ejo> Maybe I just won't worry about that.
[12:00:58] <ejo> the thing's going to be fast enough regardless.
[12:01:17] <mekwall> lathan: nvm... its my own code destroying it :D
[12:01:31] <lathan> mekwall, lol
[12:01:39] * ejo crawls back under his silicon wafer and thanks everyone
[12:01:45] <lathan> ?np @ ejo
[12:01:45] <bot-t> ejo, No Problem
[12:01:54] <SimpleAnecdote> anybody can help with my problem? (I am trying to access an inner JSON object using one of the attribute's names as a variable. i.e. j.msg.muhaha.vcColumnType (j = JSON | msg = first item | muhaha = variable containing the proper name of the second item | vcColumnType = third item))

[12:04:28] <mekwall> now its firing
[12:04:34] <mekwall> but... not working as I want it to ;)
[12:05:19] <lathan> SimpleAnecdote, I don't think $(j).children(':first').children(':first') will work, but try it :P
[12:05:39] <lathan> sorry mekwall I really can't spend more time on this, I need to be working
[12:06:00] <mekwall> lathan: np m8 ;
[12:06:04] <mekwall> good luck
[12:06:11] <SimpleAnecdote> lathan: I will actually need that variable to change. So accessing it by position is no good for me. Or maybe I didn't understand your solution.
[12:06:34] <SimpleAnecdote> is there no syntax delimiter to insert a variable rather than a property name in the middle there? (new to JS and jQuery)
[12:06:46] <phlp> SimpleAnecdote: j.msg[muhaha].vcColumnType
[12:06:51] <lathan> SimpleAnecdote, native js: ^^
[12:07:04] <lathan> or even j[msg][muhaha]['vcColumnType']
[12:07:57] <SimpleAnecdote> phlp, lathan: that did not work for me. It still says it cannot find 'vcColumnType' as it belongs to an undefined property
[12:08:16] <SimpleAnecdote> and I know for sure the rest is good because I tested it with the static name
[12:08:47] <lathan> SimpleAnecdote, check typeof(j.msg[muhaha]). make sure that is an object

[12:16:44] <sdferfx> Can I use changed() to tell if a child element has changed? I have a whole tr that contains several inputs. If any of them change, I want to know. Can I put a changed() on the tr and have the inputs below inherit it? That would make this easier. :)
[12:18:11] <jessicaf> can i output the result of a php script inside a div tag of another html page?
[12:18:23] <lathan> hlveheart, I do know that $.browser is deprecated, and they want you to use $.support for features
[12:18:32] <lathan> ?changed
[12:18:32] <bot-t> lathan, .change() - Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[12:18:40] <lathan> sdferfx, what is this changed?
[12:19:19] <sdferfx> I meant, .change(). :) Sorry.
[12:19:26] <xec> jessicaf, is the html page hosted on the same server as the php script?
[12:19:38] <sdferfx> I see I can bind it on a whole class, but that appears to be the closest I'll get
[12:19:38] <jessicaf> yes
[12:19:55] <lathan> sdferfx, change events propogate
[12:20:14] <lathan> $('#table').change(function(e){ var element = $(e.target); });
[12:20:30] <skamikaze> sdferfx: read the manual - your question is answered there ;)
[12:20:31] <jessicaf> but without refreshing the html page entirely
[12:20:41] <skamikaze> sdferfx: use a class selector and you are fine
[12:20:43] <xec> jessicaf, then you can probably just do an $.ajax() request to the php script and dump the results in whatever you select.. yes
[12:20:49] <lathan> ?jQuery.get @ jessicaf
[12:20:49] <bot-t> jessicaf, jQuery.get(url, [data], [callback], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:21:37] <jessicaf> okay if i run my php script and get out text "Result" how would it show directly in the html page ?
[12:21:58] <jessicaf> lathan that would work if i am running the html page and adding a jquery in there
[12:22:02] <lathan> ?jQuery.load @ jessicaf
[12:22:03] <bot-t> jessicaf, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:22:23] <lathan> jessicaf, you must do an ajax request to that php script that returns the "Result"
[12:23:00] <lathan> and have that load that result into the div
[12:23:25] <jessicaf> its entirely a php code
[12:23:42] <jessicaf> starts with <php? and ends with ?> with no html in it
[12:23:58] <xec> jessicaf, that shouldnt matter really
[12:24:55] <jessicaf> so when i run this php script it echos 'success' or 'failure' either of the two words
[12:25:00] <jyrialeksi> Hi guys. Is there some very simple image scroller like this on my page? www.av-taitto.net/livonia The problem with that one is that it breaks sometimes and shows only the first top 20px from image.
[12:25:08] <xec> jessicaf, it looks like the load method  lathan gave you should suffice - read up on the link he gave you
[12:25:12] <jessicaf> which i want it to show in another html page section
[12:25:26] <jessicaf> okay
[12:28:24] <jessicaf> how do i add the ajax code in php code and what would the code look like
[12:28:59] <xec> jessicaf,you don't - you include jquery in the html file where  you want the end result
[12:29:00] <progrock> anyone using jquery BBQ?
[12:29:32] <albacker> can i do $(this+' ul') ?
[12:29:40] <albacker> to select the ul inside this ?
[12:29:45] <danheberden> albacker nope
[12:29:47] <progrock> I'm getting a race conditiona after calling pushState... which seems really weird.. seeing how JS is single threaded, jsut seems weird
[12:29:48] <Tidwell> albacker: nope do $(this).children('ul')
[12:29:53] <jessicaf> but how would that show the result in the html page
[12:29:54] <danheberden> but you can do $( this ).find( 'ul ' ) or ^^^
[12:30:03] <albacker> Tidwell, danheberden thanks
[12:30:04] <jessicaf> cos i wont be running the html page url
[12:30:10] <jessicaf> i would be running the php code instead
[12:31:02] <spiff_no> hi guys!  this guy has a really cool menu  http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/mastering-css-getting-started-guest-post/    when you scroll past it, it starts to float and sticks on the top.. I guess its done with jquery, anybody here knows how, or a have some pointers on how to recreate this effect?
[12:31:22] <xec> jessicaf, what? you said you had a html page that you wanted to load something into. is it safe to assume you're visiting said html page?
[12:31:24] <Engin> no escape methods for escaping ' or " in a text before I prepare a html for it ?
[12:31:44] <jessicaf> i am not going to visit that page
[12:32:11] <jessicaf> i am going to run my php code and the result of the code should be displayed in the html
[12:32:36] <jessicaf> i can run the html adding a jquery to it and show the results of the php code .. thats no big deal ..
[12:32:55] <jessicaf> but thats not what i intend to do
[12:34:10] <albacker> Tidwell_,
[12:34:11] <albacker> 	    $(this).children('ul').each(function() {$(this).show()}); is this correct?

[12:34:37] <bot-t> jessicaf, Excuse me, I didn't quite get what you just said. Perhaps I missed some background information. Could you explain that further
[12:34:39] <Engin> lathan, that encodes quotes, not escapes them
[12:34:39] <Tidwell> albacker: if you're wanting to show every ul inside of the calling this, then yes
[12:34:39] <jessicaf_> sorry i got disconnected ..
[12:34:48] <albacker> ok thanks.
[12:34:50] <jessicaf_> what lathan?
[12:34:52] <jessicaf_> huh to what?
[12:35:06] <kborchers> albacker you could just do $(this).children('ul').show();
[12:35:11] <lathan> jessicaf, "thats not what I intend to do", more background plz, what do you want to do
[12:35:22] <albacker> kborchers, does that do it for the first one only or for all of them?
[12:35:26] <kborchers> all

[12:35:38] <jessicaf_> okay i want to run the php code and the result of the code should be displayed in the html page without refreshing the page
[12:35:55] <blindMoe> jessicaf: right now it is just showing the actual code?
[12:36:11] <jessicaf_> and i DO NOT want to the run the html page and display the result of the php code in the html page
[12:36:39] <rise_> What could be the reason for getting this error: myBoxes[i] is undefined ? before that I have var myBoxes = new Array();
[12:36:59] <blindMoe> rise_: the index 'i' doesn't exist
[12:37:05] <blindMoe> jessicaf: what result are you getting?
[12:37:32] <jessicaf_> i am echoing a form
[12:37:38] <lathan> jessicaf_, you want the page to run the php program and show the result (without reloading)?
[12:37:39] <rise_> blindMoe: what do you mean?
[12:37:45] <rise_> Oh, i get it
[12:37:47] <hlveheart> Hi. ;)

[12:38:02] <lathan> ?hi @ hlveheart
[12:38:02] <bot-t> hlveheart, :)
[12:38:09] <Engin> this should be a common problem why not there is a solution in JQ ?
[12:38:24] <rise_> but even thoug I had var myBoxes = new Array(); before?
[12:38:30] <jessicaf_> page to run the php program and show the result in a different html page
[12:39:04] <blindMoe> jessicaf_: [12:37:09] <blindMoe> jessicaf: what result are you getting?
[12:39:11] <jessicaf_> i plan to run 2 or more different php programs and show the result in one diferent html page
[12:39:32] <jessicaf_> plain text
[12:40:12] <blindMoe> is the php in a .php file and enclosed in <?php and ?>   ?
[12:40:29] <rise_> I'm following an example like this http://jsfiddle.net/LVuwT/
[12:40:30] <jessicaf_> yes
[12:40:53] <blindMoe> jessicaf_: if you visit the php directly does it work?
[12:41:01] <blindMoe> directly = type the address in your browser
[12:41:11] <jessicaf_> yes it does
[12:41:30] <BlackAnt> hmm
[12:41:32] <rosco_y> does anyone have any good tutorial links for jsTree?
[12:42:05] <blindMoe> rise_: do you have elements on your page with the class='page_item'  ?
[12:42:19] <rise_> yeah
[12:42:31] <rise_> I get the error, just after doing mouse over the first item
[12:42:48] <rise_> The first rollover is the only one that works
[12:43:56] <blindMoe> rise_: do you have as many class="destacado" elements as you do class="page_item" elements?
[12:44:14] <BlackAnt> rosco_y @ google.com/search?q=jsTree > tutorial
[12:44:14] <BlackAnt> lol
[12:44:41] <rosco_y> BlackAnt: Thank you :)
[12:44:53] <rise_> blindMoe: maybe that could be the problem
[12:45:05] <rise_> maybe my selector is to weak
[12:45:11] <blindMoe> rise_: http://jsfiddle.net/LVuwT/1/
[12:45:23] <blindMoe> the way your code is setup.. you need to have the same amount of each element
[12:45:59] <rise_> I see
[12:46:02] <blindMoe> rise_: better example: http://jsfiddle.net/4mv8L/
[12:46:08] <rise_> ill check it right away
[12:46:37] <rise_> nice, it works perfect
[12:46:43] <rise_> must be the n of elements being targeted

[12:52:13] <lathan> rise_, $('ul').find(':first-child')

[12:52:47] <BlackAnt> li:first-child

[12:53:15] <rise_> yeah!
[12:53:25] <rise_> that's what I really meant

[12:55:27] <Whirl3d> Is this opacity thing  a jquery bug or just Firefox being ridiculous?
[12:55:35] <Guest34457> Hey is there a way (through selectors) to give and index of a child from the end?
[12:56:11] <xec> Whirl3d, what version of firefox? i think you might need -moz-opacity
[12:56:13] <e1f> gaaah! ie returns an rgb string without spaces after the commas while ff has spaces
[12:56:18] <Whirl3d> 4 or 5
[12:56:28] <albacker> how do i select every <li> that doesn't have the class 'selected' ?
[12:56:33] <BlackAnt> I prefer to use the rgba(111,111,111,0.7) opacity way than just using background: #222; opacity: 0.7
[12:56:42] <Whirl3d> -mos-opacity breaks it completely. Won't even load part of the page
[12:56:51] <Whirl3d> *-moz-opacity
[12:56:52] <Guest34457> maybe something like $("#table tr:eq(-1)")
[12:57:00] <Guest34457> but that doesnt work
[12:57:10] <xec> Whirl3d, ff4 should support opacity, maybe a typo nearby?
[12:57:16] <lathan> ?g moz-opacity
[12:57:17] <bot-t> lathan, opacity - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS:opacity
[12:57:32] <Whirl3d> No, it's just when animating opacity in jquery that I have the problem.
[12:57:56] <erichynds> albacker: $('li:not(.selected)')
[12:57:57] <kborchers> albacker: $("li").not(".selected")
[12:57:59] <xec> oh
[12:58:04] <lathan> Whirl3d, mozila says use opacity instead
[12:58:11] <albacker> thanks guys
[12:58:16] <lathan> ?np @ albacker
[12:58:16] <bot-t> albacker, No Problem
[12:58:28] <BlackAnt> using opacity inside a parent div, it's children becomes blur. I don't know if its just me
[12:58:51] <BlackAnt> but with rgba(), gets to my thirst
[12:58:52] <xec> BlackAnt, that is correct behaviour
[12:59:10] <xec> yes, rgba saves the day :)
[12:59:28] <Whirl3d> but jQuery should handle that, right?
[12:59:44] <BlackAnt> rgba doesnt work on < msie8
[13:00:03] <BlackAnt> not sure if including i.e.js fixed it
[13:00:13] <BlackAnt> not sure if including ie8.js fixed it
[13:00:14] <rise_> How could I create a false mouseover event on each of the items so that there's a auto cycle effect?
[13:00:25] <rise_> *an

[13:01:18] <slartsa> hmm, apparently updating from 1.3.* to 1.6.* breaks alot of things
[13:01:46] <tarkus> Hey guys!
[13:01:52] <Whirl3d> rise_, $(".mouseitem").trigger("mouseover"); ?
[13:01:58] <xec> Whirl3d, can you make a quick jsfiddle with your animation?
[13:02:10] * tarkus is looking for advise how to improve code quality here: http://pastebin.com/tmZiMhCp
[13:02:53] <Whirl3d> Here's the url, it's still rough, but it shows the problem. I'll see if I can isolate it better in a fiddle, though: http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/index.html
[13:03:01] <Whirl3d> btw, thanks for your help.
[13:03:29] <rise_> Whirl3d: sorry, what I meant was that instead of going over the elements with mouseover, they cycled automatically. I was talking about a code I posted a little while ago
[13:03:38] <Aple> Is it possible to traverse from .mylink to the next <tr> tag in this table? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417116/
[13:04:04] <Aple> Like if I wanted to change that <tr> tag to display:block; ?
[13:04:08] <rise_> Whirl3d: I've just understood what you meant
[13:04:09] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle only does jquery 1.6 where there's a documented bug with opacity.
[13:04:50] <xec> Whirl3d, maybe include resource manually works? havent tried tho
[13:05:16] <Whirl3d> xec, huh? What do you mean include resource manually?
[13:05:33] <xec> in jsfiddle you can include external resources
[13:05:33] <Whirl3d> oh, on jsfiddle. DUH, sorry
[13:05:40] <xec> :D
[13:06:12] <xec> i just get a black page on that url btw, maybe just me?
[13:07:03] <xec> probably just me, now i got a connection reset error - my net's been acting up lately =(
[13:07:10] <Aple> Nevermind guys, got it
[13:07:17] <Aple> closest('tr').next('tr')
[13:07:49] <kborchers> Aple: you can just do .next() don't need the tr selector there
[13:07:59] <kborchers> closest('tr').next()
[13:08:10] <rise_> So first I should set up a timer or something like that, so that each x seconds $j('ul#main-menu > li.page_item').trigger("mouseover"); happens on each element?
[13:08:38] <Whirl3d> just figured it out most likely. If you animate opacity to 0 using "easeOutBack", you end up with a negative number for a small part of the animation. Negative opacity triggers the error
[13:08:55] <xec> Aple, you might want display: table-row; rather than block btw
[13:09:13] <xec> Whirl3d, aha, that makes sense
[13:09:35] <Whirl3d> so, now I either have to setup a second animation for opacity or figure out how to make a custom queued animation...blech
[13:09:43] <rosco_y> Thanks for the great resources lathan, I really appreciate it!
[13:10:02] <lathan> ?np @ rosco_y
[13:10:03] <bot-t> rosco_y, No Problem
[13:10:39] <lathan> xec, Aple careful about compatability for display: table-row
[13:10:48] <lathan> ?g browser compliance display table-row
[13:10:48] <bot-t> lathan, CSS2 - The display declaration - http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html
[13:10:57] <rise_> Will something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/VUm3H/
[13:11:57] <lathan> http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/display
[13:12:00] <xec> lathan, maybe .show() will sort it out?
[13:12:21] <Aple> How can I toggle css?
[13:12:25] <lathan> xec, when you do .hide() it stores in data what the previous value was, show looks for that
[13:12:27] <lathan> ?toggle css
[13:12:28] <bot-t> lathan, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[13:12:30] <lathan> no
[13:12:48] <lathan> Aple, it depends on what style
[13:12:49] <xec> lathan, what if it starts out as display: none;
[13:12:51] <lathan> you can toggle classes....
[13:13:09] <lathan> xec, then it should go to the correct "showing" display
[13:13:11] <lathan> usually block
[13:13:23] <lathan> but it might check compatability of others. *might*
[13:14:02] <Aple> lathan: Bottom border
[13:14:17] <lathan> ?
[13:14:20] <Aple> lathan: Like I have a bottom border. When someone clicks it, it disappears. When they click the same link, I want it to re-appear
[13:14:58] <xec> Aple, if its defined in a css class you can .toggleClass()
[13:15:06] <Aple> xec: Nice!
[13:15:07] <Aple> :)
[13:15:29] <lathan> ?toggle border
[13:15:30] <bot-t> lathan, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:16:12] <lathan> Aple, yah, as xec said....toggleclass is much easier than tracking the toggling yourself
[13:17:31] <rise_> I've managed to trigger them all at once with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/VUm3H/1/ What should i do in order to trigger one after the other and then loop?
[13:19:10] <Aple> xec: I don't suppose I can target a bunch of children with toggleClass right?
[13:19:30] <xec> Aple, you can target anything you can select, i think
[13:19:41] <Aple> xec: Like ('.statement_even_top').toggleClass('.statement_even_top td') ?
[13:21:12] <kborchers> Aple: switch those selectors
[13:21:30] <kborchers> $('.statement_even_top td').toggleClass('.statement_even_top');
[13:21:42] <xec> no more like $('.statement_even_top td').toggleClass('statement_even_top')
[13:21:43] <Aple> Right, but I don't have a class for all those td
[13:21:52] <albacker> can someone tell me why it's not working as it should when clicking following followers : http://eni.pr-ing.com/kot3.html ?
[13:21:57] <Aple> I suppose I have to define a class on them first
[13:21:59] <Aple> I see now.
[13:22:00] <Aple> Thanks guys
[13:22:03] <xec> well
[13:22:13] <xec> just define an id or class on the common parent
[13:22:20] <xec> like, the table
[13:22:45] <xec> then do $('#myTable td').toggleClass( ..etc )
[13:23:32] <xec> that is, if you want to toggle the class on all the td's at the same time
[13:25:20] <rise_> Here's the complete fiddle sorry about the broken ones http://jsfiddle.net/4mv8L/3/
[13:27:44] <Aple> xec: Huh... is there any way of making it remove the class first?
[13:27:46] <bobbobbins> hey, i need to build something(a plugin  i guess) in jquery that scoops up other methods users have written that are stored in separate files and adds them so they can be referenced via that plugin...anyone know how to do that?
[13:28:13] <Aple> xec: I already have the class assigned, when they click the item, it assigns the class again.
[13:28:26] <xec> the same exact class? no typos?
[13:28:31] <bobbobbins> i guess maybe the separate files just extend the plugin...does anyone know of a good doc that can explain how to do that?
[13:29:51] <albacker> can someone help me?
[13:29:52] <Whirl3d> FF5 is wack. I just made a fiddle in FF5 and it kept telling me I had an error on a line that didn't exist. So I opened the fiddle in Chrome, and there were several errors that didn't show up in FF and the error FF indicated wasnt listed.
[13:30:42] <systemfault> Then use chrome?
[13:30:50] <systemfault> Their dev tools are better anyway.
[13:31:31] <Whirl3d> systemfault, thanks. I should've thought of that.
[13:31:43] <Whirl3d> <-smacks head
[13:31:56] <Whirl3d> Seriously, though. Does anyone know what this means:  The body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype.
[13:32:21] <systemfault> Whirl3d: To use for/in in combination with hasOwnProperty
[13:33:07] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/c6CzZ/10/
[13:33:36] <systemfault> Whirl3d: for/in is not for arrays.
[13:33:48] <systemfault> Whirl3d: It's to iterate on object properties.
[13:34:22] <lathan> bobbobbins, you are moving in the direction of the utilities that is used to compile jQuery source all into one file
[13:34:29] <systemfault> Whirl3d: For an array, use either a normal "for", .forEach (newer browser only) or $.each
[13:34:53] <lathan> systemfault, Whirl3d oh please don't say to use "for" in the jQuery channel.....
[13:35:06] <bobbobbins> lathan: does that mean its difficult?
[13:35:07] <systemfault> lathan: Sorry?
[13:35:26] <lathan> systemfault, just .each is meant to make the for looping easier....not a big thing
[13:35:34] <systemfault> lathan: Ah ok :)
[13:35:45] <lathan> bobbobbins, no, that's just all I remember, I don't know what its called
[13:35:52] <Whirl3d> Except that .each works on a jquery collection, not a simple array, right?
[13:36:06] <lathan> hey ajpiano is there a name of a  utility that jquery dev team uses to compile the jquery source files into one?
[13:36:16] <lathan> ajpiano, bobbobbins wants to know
[13:36:25] <systemfault> Whirl3d: $.each(array, function(index, elem) { dosomething(); }); IIRC
[13:36:38] <lathan> did you just say i recant? @ systemfault
[13:36:48] <lathan> or function(i,e)
[13:36:56] <lathan> smaller variables in simple loops are nicer
[13:37:00] <lathan> *nice
[13:37:11] <systemfault> lathan: :( You're being difficult :'(
[13:37:19] <ajpiano> lathan, bobbobbins .... make? nodejs? uglify?
[13:37:28] <lathan> systemfault, lol, sorry
[13:37:32] <lathan> I'm nitpicking
[13:37:33] <lathan> ?nitpicking
[13:37:37] <bot-t> lathan, Friday, 2011-05-27 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquerymobile-dev_20110527.log.html
[13:38:03] <erichynds> the build scripts are available on github
[13:38:10] <systemfault> lathan: :)
[13:38:12] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: im just trying to a plugin whos methods are in separate js files
[13:38:29] <ajpiano> that's an entirely different thing
[13:38:39] <bobbobbins> kinda figured it was
[13:38:43] <Whirl3d> I'm going back to bed. Today is just not a good day for me to write code. Everything is fighting me. systemfault, thanks for your help. gnite all
[13:39:08] <systemfault> Whirl3d: See you :)
[13:39:10] <bobbobbins> basically several developers will be writing widgets, and we want to keep them all in separate places, but accessable by one plugin
[13:40:07] <ajpiano> bobbobbins, you'd have to design a mechanism by which other things can register extensions or something like that
[13:40:32] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: hmm...that sounds tricky...im not much of a mechanism designer...
[13:40:57] <ajpiano> are you a programmer
[13:40:58] <ajpiano> :/
[13:41:24] <bobbobbins> haha, yeah, but not much of a jquery one
[13:41:36] <nbari> hi alll a .post is returing data serialized like row1=test&row2=bbb how can i access to the vars for later handle ?
[13:41:37] <systemfault> Modeling is the fun part of programming :P
[13:41:37] <bobbobbins> im a php developer thrust into a project over my head!
[13:42:36] <bobbobbins> im sure i'll figure it out, but they want it by friday
[13:43:01] <knapper_tech> is there an event for whenever a drop-down menu item is selected?
[13:44:53] <bobbobbins> knapper_tech: wouldn't that be tied to an anchor or something?
[13:45:00] <albacker> after clicking ass soon as i add the selected class to $(this) the click for $('.selected') is launched. even though i've clicked only once. it's like click on unselected item, select it, *click on selected item*. what can cause this?
[13:45:25] <knapper_tech> I guess I can register each option with a click function?
[13:45:46] <knapper_tech> instead of getting a select event, get the events for the options
[13:46:02] <systemfault> knapper_tech: Perhaps the change event.
[13:46:06] <kborchers> knapper_tech: but that doesn't cover keyboard interaction
[13:46:12] <knapper_tech> :-(
[13:46:37] <kborchers> change event will fire on every change with a keyboard. that's a tough one
[13:47:13] <nbari> is there something like unserlilize so i get later user the vars thatare serialized ?
[13:48:21] <systemfault> nbari: I don't think there is but a few "split" could do it
[13:48:23] <nbari> better say is tehre a parse_str ?
[13:48:51] <nbari> the returned data i get is like var=XXXX&var2=YYYY
[13:49:22] <systemfault> 1) split on & 2) for every splited tokens, split again on =
[13:49:34] <nbari> ok
[13:49:36] <systemfault> Should be a 3-4 lines max.
[13:50:13] <systemfault> nbari: When possible, if you have control over what the server sends you... send json instead
[13:50:14] <defendguin> i've got a very curious thing going on.  i have a datepicker and for whatever reason having the date picker causes a colored div rectangle at the bottom of my page.  when i click on the date picker the div disappears and doesn't reappear unless the page is refreshed.  it's like the datpicker method creates this div but forgets to set it's display to none
[13:50:24] <nbari> ok
[13:50:41] <defendguin> maybe it's getting over ruled by something
[13:50:48] <shiftins> anyone know a good way to put focus back on the window after giving flash focus?
[13:52:38] <TehCodr> Where's the best place to learn about making dropdown menus?
[13:53:18] <innociv> ... moxiecodes site is down.  Great.
[13:53:25] <TehCodr> ty
[13:53:30] <innociv> you can do dropdowns with just css.  That's a good place to start.

[13:55:55] <bot-t> jacof, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:56:21] <jacof> Hmmm can't do PHP in jsfiddle :(
[13:56:28] <bobbobbins> knapper_tech: i had a workaround for this once...give me a minute to check
[13:56:39] <jacof> It's a php that generates a gallery, and needs jquery for preloading the images.
[13:56:59] <smik>  I'm struck with CORS Ajax. I have a host on my server,  foo.com/dav/test.json which is a webdav. I have Basic authorization on it. This http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417125/ is my .htaccess file for foo.com/dav/ . I'm using following (with firebug) to access a resource http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417126/ . This works if I am on foo.com(Dump of interaction: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417127/). But doesn't work(returns Authorization
[13:56:59] <smik>  required) if I call that from some other website (Dump of interaction:http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417128/).

[14:04:36] <Necroiest> when i send this request"http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/mentions.json" what will json return and how can i access the mentions
[14:04:45] <jacof> i don't know how to use jsfiddle for this but you can see the whole tihng there.
[14:04:47] <defendguin> kborchers: so many different css files it is hard to get the fiddle just right
[14:04:48] <thatryan> DJTrey1: I am trying to get the date items were posted
[14:04:51] <thatryan> from a json return
[14:05:50] <thatryan> DJTrey1: here is s snippet of what is returned, http://pastie.textmate.org/2108191
[14:06:25] <DJTrey1> thatryan: you using new Date()
[14:06:26] <DJTrey1> ?
[14:06:29] <kborchers> defendguin: the fiddle doesn't need to be an exact replica of your page, just a simplified example that shows the issue. if you aren't able to simplify and show the problem, it probably isn't a problem with datepicker. ;)
[14:06:46] <thatryan> DJTrey1: yes, date: new Date(item.date),
[14:06:50] <defendguin> http://jsfiddle.net/6tYww/
[14:07:10] <Necroiest> can anyone help me with twitter api ?
[14:07:18] <DJTrey1> thatryan: couldn't you do item.getDate(); then?
[14:07:28] <defendguin> kborchers: yeah i know
[14:08:01] <thatryan> I am pushing it into an object at same time..   http://pastie.textmate.org/2108202
[14:08:11] <jacof> go tit.
[14:09:14] <kborchers> defendguin: u need to get that fiddle working before i can help with the issue you described
[14:10:39] <lathan> jacof, idk, but its somthing about this line: jQuery.preloadImages
[14:10:55] <lathan> if I comment that line out, the program doesn't stop running
[14:11:15] <jacof> lathan:  yea, i think i found it. it's the jQuery(this).appendTo('#image_loader_'+(index+1)+' a.load_blog_img'');
[14:11:22] <lathan> okay
[14:11:29] <jacof> where a.load_blog_img doesn't exist
[14:11:38] <jacof> and should be replaced with a.load_portfolio_img
[14:11:43] <jacof> i think*
[14:12:44] <jacof> lathan: is there a more convenient way
[14:12:44] <dragonshed|work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3642035/jquerys-append-not-working-with-svg-element
[14:12:50] <dragonshed|work> "Noooooo!"
[14:13:05] <jacof> where i should state that it loads whether on a.load_blog_img or if a_portfolio_img exists, do that to
[14:14:18] <lathan> jacof, idk, and its getting to be the end of the day for me, I think I've done all the javascript thinking for the day.....
[14:14:35] <jacof> k thnx
[14:14:39] <MatthiasVance> Is there a way in jquery to get to the right HTMLDocument (window.document) of an iframe?
[14:14:48] <defendguin> kborchers: seems like ui-helper-clearfix  is adding the display: block; css property
[14:17:16] <defendguin> or maybe not
[14:17:31] <vasocreta> having a serious issue with jquery loading time. My jquery plugins are attempting to execute before the library is loaded, so I get the $ is undefined in firebug. Any thoughts? Jquery is loaded in the head and the other scripts are loaded before the </body>
[14:19:00] <kborchers> vasocreta: can you provide a link?
[14:19:45] <vasocreta> kborchers: I wish I could. It is a site still in dev. Just didn't know if this was some basic problem.
[14:20:04] <JordiGH> How do I say this "this class or that other class; either one inside that other one"?
[14:20:17] <JordiGH> like "A in C or B in C".
[14:20:21] <JordiGH> In a selector.
[14:20:25] <kborchers> hard to tell without seeing it. are the errors happening in the plugins or in the page where you use the plugins?
[14:20:53] <Vaerros> JordiGH: .c .a, .c .b ?
[14:21:04] <JordiGH> Vaerros: Just like that? Thanks.
[14:22:15] <JordiGH> Oh, how do you add a class to an element? Not overwrite whatever class is already there, just give it another class.
[14:22:19] <vasocreta> kborchers: in the page using the plugins. Example: there is a slideshow using cycle. The slideshow displays in its list format (one image on top of the other) because the plugin tries to execute before the library is loaded (according to the "net" feature in firebug).
[14:22:31] <Vaerros> JordiGH: class='class1 class2'
[14:22:41] <JordiGH> I mean, an element I got from $()
[14:22:41] <Vaerros> note that IE6 has issues with multiple class selector
[14:22:45] <vasocreta> kborchers: if I hit refresh, it works because now the library is cached.
[14:22:53] <JordiGH> IE6 can suck it.
[14:23:00] <vasocreta> Jordi: agreed
[14:23:05] <Vaerros> JordiGH: jquery?
[14:23:13] <JordiGH> Yes, jquery.
[14:23:15] <Vaerros> oh
[14:23:24] <Vaerros> LOL I thought I was in #css
[14:23:26] <JordiGH> lol
[14:23:30] <Vaerros> $('.foo1').addClass('foo2')
[14:23:41] <JordiGH> Thanks.
[14:23:45] <Vaerros> yarizard
[14:23:48] <MatthiasVance> Is there a way in jquery to get window.document? :) I'm basically looking for the document of an iframe.
[14:24:43] <kborchers> vasocreta: have you tried wrapping your call to cycle in $(function() {...
[14:25:16] <vasocreta> kbrochers: it is.
[14:25:27] <vasocreta> Opera handles it just fine.
[14:25:54] <vasocreta> FF3.6+ on windows and Chrome get it right maybe 2 out of 5 times.
[14:26:37] <lathan> MatthiasVance, is the iframe named?
[14:26:59] <lathan> if so, then frames[$('iframe').attr('name')].document
[14:27:08] <kborchers> that is very strange indeed. unfortunately without seeing i don't know how much more help i can be. you may want to try creating a fiddle or page that is public that demonstrates this issue and someone may be able to help. i have to leave in a few minutes
[14:27:41] <vasocreta> kbrochers: thanks. I will see what I can do. You are right though, I need an example
[14:27:56] <MatthiasVance> lathan: That's not using jquery (besides the name part), and are you sure that works cross-browser?
[14:28:26] <MatthiasVance> I normally have to use: frame.contentDocument || frame.contentWindow.document
[14:28:37] <lathan> ?iframe document
[14:28:38] <bot-t> lathan, .contents() - Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:28:52] <lathan> MatthiasVance, I don't know about getting the document, but...
[14:29:00] <lathan> $('iframe').contents('#id') will work
[14:29:25] <MatthiasVance> You are misunderstanding. contents() does -not- return the document, it returns the contents of that document
[14:29:31] <jessicaf_> hi can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong in this code http://pastebin.com/uRDjGU1X
[14:29:40] <lathan> MatthiasVance, no, I understand, I said it wouldn't get the document
[14:29:44] <MatthiasVance> So, I think the best way to do this is still manually.
[14:30:11] <jessicaf_> it submits both the forms when i press submit querry
[14:30:39] <lathan> quite possibly @ MatthiasVance
[14:31:02] <JordiGH> So...
[14:31:12] <MatthiasVance> Thanks for thinking along, good night!
[14:31:43] <JordiGH> var f = function(){alert(this.id);} foo.find(".lol").each(f);
[14:31:46] <JordiGH> Will this work?
[14:32:05] <JordiGH> Or will "this" not be bound to the right thing?
[14:32:13] <progrock> this wont eb right
[14:32:16] <progrock> i dont think
[14:32:31] <snover> JordiGH: it will work fine
[14:32:43] <JordiGH> foo.find(".lol").each(function(){alert(this.id);});
[14:32:44] <JordiGH> But that does?
[14:32:49] <snover> either one will work fine.
[14:32:53] <JordiGH> k
[14:33:11] <snover> ?alert @ JordiGH
[14:33:12] <bot-t> JordiGH, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[14:33:12] <progrock> oh.. I thought $.each  gave the argumetns index, elem
[14:33:43] <progrock> thoguth it woud be f = function(index, elem) { alert(elem.id); };
[14:34:05] <systemfault> Why?, he can use this
[14:35:02] <JordiGH> I'm gonna have to tias, won't I?
[14:35:07] <systemfault> Sure.
[14:35:16] <systemfault> With jsfiddle, it takes a minute
[14:35:21] <systemfault> But it will work just fine.
[14:36:05] <jessicaf_> can someone please tell me how to validate one form at a time http://pastebin.com/uRDjGU1X
[14:37:14] <systemfault> jessicaf_: Use jsfiddle.net, we're lazy.
[14:37:20] <systemfault> Help us to help you.
[14:37:50] <jessicaf_> systemfault come on
[14:38:09] <rise_> why should this code $j('ul#main-menu > li.page_item a').attr('href','#'); be also replacing the href of all the nested ul li a if im just specifying it to the first level only?
[14:38:56] <rise_> my ul li ul li a href is also being replaced :/
[14:39:10] <systemfault> rise_: That's exactly what that selector says.
[14:39:38] <JordiGH> How do you find arguments to a function given in a callback?
[14:39:39] <systemfault> perhaps you want $j('ul#main-menu > li.page_item > a')
[14:39:44] <rise_> :o
[14:39:45] <JordiGH> bind, not find
[14:40:26] <rise_> systemfault: yeah, that did it :)
[14:40:28] <rise_> thanks
[14:40:39] <systemfault> rise_: You're welcome.
[14:41:15] <jessicaf_> jhttp://jsfiddle.net/VWYME/ there
[14:41:20] <jessicaf_> now can you help?

[14:44:14] <chrislabeard> Hi, guys I'm trying to a wheel and whenever the user rolls over one side of the wheel it will make a link fade in. But i'm not sure how to trigger that area of the circle when its hovered over any ideas?
[14:45:19] <chrislabeard> oh i guess i could just animate the opacity
[14:45:20] <chrislabeard> lol
[14:49:19] <SEJeff> How can I make $(element).append(somehtml) not escape urls in somehtml
[14:52:50] <d4rklit3> what is the syntax to add css to an element e.g.   var likeBar = $("<div/>", {'class' : 'statbar'}, 'css' : { 'attr' : 'value'} );
[14:52:52] <d4rklit3> is that correcT?
[14:53:04] <Patatouf> hi everyone ! I would like to know what are the function used in the google calendar to create an event with the mouse in the week view ?
[14:53:17] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, $(element).addClass("statbar")
[14:53:18] <d4rklit3> thats not it
[14:53:33] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, and $(element).css("attr", "value")
[14:53:34] <SEJeff> yes it is
[14:53:38] <d4rklit3> hmm
[14:53:42] <spiff_no> $("div").removeClass("stickyBuy").addClass("fixedBuy");   this one affects every div in the html doc.. how can I target just a specific div? like <div id="someDiv">
[14:53:51] <d4rklit3> thats how im making the element tho
[14:53:54] <d4rklit3> but thats fine
[14:53:58] <d4rklit3> i'll just use .css()
[14:54:00] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, Paste code
[14:54:04] <d4rklit3> don't worry about it
[14:54:20] <d4rklit3> i thought there was some shorthand
[14:54:28] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, shorthand for what?
[14:54:32] <SEJeff> adding a bunch?
[14:54:35] <d4rklit3> yeah
[14:54:40] <d4rklit3> var likeBar = $("<div/>", {'class' : 'statbar'});
[14:54:45] <d4rklit3> i make that then i can just add to that
[14:54:55] <d4rklit3> var likeBar = $("<div/>", {'class' : 'statbar'}).css() right?;
[14:55:03] <SEJeff> spiff_no, Look up the docs on selectors. Ids can be selected like this: $("#someDiv")
[14:55:18] <el_braydo> hi
[14:55:23] <spiff_no> thanks, SEJeff :)
[14:55:24] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, Wait are you wanting to select divs with class statbar?
[14:55:29] <d4rklit3> n
[14:55:30] <d4rklit3> o
[14:55:31] <SEJeff> or add a class Statbar?
[14:55:31] <el_braydo> hopefully someone can help me
[14:55:45] <d4rklit3> i want to make divs w/ class statbar to have varying color and widths
[14:55:53] <Patatouf> hi everyone ! I would like to know what are the function used in the google calendar to create an event with the mouse in the week view ? any idea ?
[14:56:19] <Zenethian> Hello.  I'm having an issue where a .slideDown() call inside of a click event isn't animating properly.  This is in jQuery 1.4.3.  If I call it manually in the firebug console, it animates just fine.  But when being called from the click event (of an anchor, if that matters) it just jerks in as if just being called with .show().  Anyone have any ideas?
[14:56:34] <ColKurtz> Patatouf I wonder if jQuery FullCalendar would be of use to you?
[14:56:36] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, $(element).addClass("hi").addClass("mom")...
[14:56:55] <d4rklit3> i want to define the class inline w/ js
[14:57:08] <el_braydo> is it possible to select all divs with a wildcard
[14:57:42] <ColKurtz> um
[14:57:44] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, I still fail to see why this is so hard. It is jquery, not rocket surgery var foo = "bar"; $(element).addClass(foo);
[14:57:45] <ColKurtz> $('div')
[14:57:53] <d4rklit3> SEJeff its not hard
[14:57:53] <d4rklit3> :)
[14:57:55] <d4rklit3> like i said
[14:57:58] <el_braydo> eg: I have X number of divs with ids like "message-ids-1", "message-ids-2", "message-ids-3", etc
[14:57:58] <d4rklit3> don't worry about it
[14:58:06] <SEJeff> have fun with that :)
[14:58:10] <Patatouf> ColKurtz I have seen it but it does too many things and I would like to better control the look and feel. In fact The only thing I dont find is how to create an event using my mouse ? is it the .selectable function or another one ?
[14:58:24] <David_Bradbury> Are there any plugins for starting, pausing, and resuming animations? (or can jQuery do it natively?)
[14:58:37] <ColKurtz> patatouf it's pretty damn good. you can style it any way you want with CSS
[15:00:25] <ColKurtz> el_braydo, it would be a PITA with your IDs set up like that
[15:00:39] <ColKurtz> you should just give those <div>s a class name
[15:01:03] <ColKurtz> <div id="msg-01" class="msg"></div>
[15:01:18] <el_braydo> ah ok I got ya
[15:01:27] <el_braydo> KISS
[15:01:41] <el_braydo> I've been staring at this too long I forget to keep it simple
[15:05:52] <SEJeff> d4rklit3, http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ I didn't know addClass accepts multiple classes space separated until just now
[15:11:48] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: got any experience working with iframes?
[15:12:08] <gnarf> you mean those things we should avoid using at all costs? :)
[15:12:28] <MoTiOnXml> not really
[15:12:29] <gnarf> very little, and they are all horror stories
[15:12:32] <MoTiOnXml> did i say that? :)
[15:13:23] <MoTiOnXml> i'm writing a overlay that embeds an iframe and i'd like to do the classic esc-key => close
[15:13:54] <MoTiOnXml> however, with IE i can actually attach an event to the document of the created iframe but in chrome it fails
[15:14:19] <MoTiOnXml> and i was hoping i don't have to run a piece of script in side the contents of the iframe
[15:14:30] <gnarf> danheberden: yer @ is showing ;)
[15:14:32] <MoTiOnXml> sort of instrumenting it from the outside, now that i own the iframe and the document inside of it
[15:15:09] <David_Bradbury> How would I animate an element from 0 to it's full height? (not to 100% of the parent element)?
[15:15:10] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: you can write a function on the inside that is called from the outside
[15:15:10] <danheberden> gnarf thnx, forgot to kill it
[15:15:16] <David_Bradbury> its*
[15:15:33] <gnarf> David_Bradbury: .slideDown() ?
[15:15:46] <David_Bradbury> gnarf: I'm doing a custom animation
[15:15:47] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: yea, listening for esc on the inside then notify outside?
[15:15:53] <gnarf> height: "show"
[15:16:06] <David_Bradbury> Cool, I'll try that :)
[15:16:54] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: if that's what you mean (above), then i was hoping to instrument it from the outside without having to run a specielt piece of code on the inside
[15:17:30] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: sorry, iframes are evil
[15:17:34] <gnarf> not my fault
[15:17:41] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: not blaming you - yet :)
[15:18:03] <MoTiOnXml> i guess one could open the iframe for writing then embed the code
[15:23:40] <mainVoid> when a variable is declared in $(document).ready(function(){ var foo = 'bar ' }) how do you access it out of that scope?
[15:26:01] <gnarf> mainVoid: you don't
[15:26:07] <gnarf> mainVoid: thats the whole point
[15:26:07] <walkingeyerobot> mainVoid: so you can't do that. that's what a closure is. if you want access to it, try something like window.yourNamespace.foo = 'bar ';. then you'll be able to access it.
[15:26:39] <mainVoid> exacccttttly
[15:29:06] <versatiletech> any image gallery plugins you would recommend that can tie up any existing design and just only handle the events and transitions instead of auto-generating its own HTML/CSS?
[15:33:21] <kawohi808> when i'm using ajax .load(), should I put the CSS reference in the file im using ajax on or the file that the file is being loaded to?
[15:34:16] <innociv> How would I remove the period and everything after it on a string?  ie "topics.php"->"topics"
[15:36:57] <initzero> innociv, "topics.php".split(".")[0]
[15:37:28] <innociv> Haha.  I was thinking a replace, but that's cleaver.
[15:37:32] <innociv> clever* ;x
[15:46:13] <Kaseano> is it possible to overlap two animations
[15:46:34] <Kaseano> like an opacity with a 400 dur, and a transformation with 1000
[15:46:57] <Kaseano> they seem to queue after eachother

[15:47:52] <ColKurtz> dutch oven?
[15:48:28] <mekwall> ColKurtz: nope, swedish oven!
[15:50:12] <MoTiOnXml> where on the element does jQuery store data()?
[15:50:29] <MoTiOnXml> is there a local container or is it in a global map?
[15:50:32] <snover> MoTiOnXml: why are you asking?
[15:51:06] <cuqaa> hello. why is that not working?
[15:51:07] <cuqaa> $.getJSON("http://www.bitcoins.lc/stats.json", function(json) { $('#difficulty').html(json.difficulty); });
[15:51:38] <MoTiOnXml> snover: because of a collission between mootools and jquery widgets - possibly
[15:52:03] <snover> MoTiOnXml: what version of jquery are you using?
[15:52:24] <MoTiOnXml> snover: 1.6.1
[15:52:34] <snover> MoTiOnXml: there’s no way that there would be any collision.
[15:53:50] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: it stores it on a private variable inside the jQuery closure using a unique identifier stored on an attrib
[15:54:07] <gnarf> just look at the source

[16:08:31] <aroman> what might prevent jQuery from selecting something?
[16:09:01] <bbrandon> very few things
[16:09:04] <muley> not using document.ready, invalid dom (i.e. duplicate ids), not including jquery...
[16:09:11] <muley> error console say anything?
[16:09:17] <jedimind> magical elves
[16:09:31] <muley> xD
[16:10:02] <Hellayou> Hi
[16:10:42] <aroman> console says nothing

[16:15:11] <abjorn> whoop whoop going to a NodeJS meetup in austin in a little bit :>
[16:15:36] <coldhead> hey have fun with that, abjorn
[16:15:45] <coldhead> are any of the local luminaries attending?
[16:15:50] <coldhead> apart from yourself, obv.
[16:16:03] <abjorn> I'm a luminarie?
[16:16:18] <abjorn> http://www.meetup.com/noders/events/17102719 well idk
[16:16:20] <abjorn> I recognize some names
[16:16:59] <abjorn> vaguely
[16:17:56] <coldhead> fuck yeah nodejs <3
[16:17:59] <abjorn> I don't think anyone in here, though
[16:18:05] <abjorn> yeah buddy
[16:18:28] <Hierofant> hi.  coldhead why do you love nodejs?
[16:18:38] <coldhead> SlexAxton, pifantastic and garran are in austin
[16:18:43] <coldhead> i think
[16:18:48] <abjorn> I should make an All Boy Hack Night just to spite the All Girl Hack Night
[16:18:50] <abjorn> Yeah, I know
[16:18:52] <coldhead> Hierofant: it's okay
[16:18:57] <abjorn> none of them are going tho :<
[16:19:04] <coldhead> jerks
[16:19:15] <abjorn> I think garran was listed as going for awhile but changed her rsvp
[16:19:46] <coldhead> well be sure to bad mouth them in their absence
[16:19:56] <abjorn> lol why would I do such a thing?!
[16:20:04] <abjorn> Me? Bad mouthing? Nonsense
[16:21:17] <coldhead> just say you heard they were at a klan rally
[16:22:13] <abjorn> roflmao
[16:22:21] <supsup> why is pop so slow? http://jsperf.com/pop-vs-for-length  is this bad test i made?
[16:22:26] <abjorn> "I think they were gonna come but I hear they had some klan business to attend to."
[16:22:55] <supsup> err
[16:22:59] <supsup> why is while so slow rather
[16:23:10] <supsup> lol wrong name too ~
[16:24:04] <abjorn> supsup: That test wouldn't work right, since the for loop will stop about halfway each time, leaving half the array unpopped
[16:24:18] <supsup> it works i tested both in jsfiddle
[16:24:31] <abjorn> Oh, it'll *run*
[16:24:37] <abjorn> The results will be misleading, however
[16:24:38] <supsup> it pops each element?
[16:24:48] <abjorn> The for loop won't pop each element
[16:24:49] <supsup> i did console.log to verify ... guess some other issue
[16:24:53] <abjorn> Oh wait
[16:24:55] <abjorn> oh no you're right
[16:24:58] <abjorn> lol I'm stupid
[16:25:01] <abjorn> LONG DAY AT WORK MY BAD
[16:25:11] <abjorn> since you saved the length in a var before hand
[16:25:13] * blindMoe pats abjorn on the head and hands them a beer
[16:25:18] <supsup> word
[16:25:29] <supsup> i live in austin too i should go to that node meeting now and make fun of u
[16:25:31] <abjorn> blindMoe: Thank you kind sir
[16:25:37] <abjorn> lol noooo!
[16:25:45] <blindMoe> haha
[16:25:46] <abjorn> geez now I can't go, to save face
[16:25:58] <blindMoe> I think you _have_ to go in order to save face
[16:25:58] <supsup> jk.  i would not even make it there now if i left -- i'm still @work
[16:26:02] <abjorn> rofl
[16:26:12] <blindMoe> always better to have people make fun of you to your face than behind your back ;)
[16:26:14] <abjorn> which reminds me, I should get going lol
[16:26:20] <supsup> i was messing around with some arrays and was wondering if that while idea was cool or not
[16:26:33] <supsup> it appears to not be cool
[16:27:12] <abjorn> lol
[16:30:12] <abjorn> man, this is probably going to be
[16:30:14] <abjorn> really awkward for me
[16:30:19] <abjorn> I'm not the most sociable person
[16:30:24] <abjorn> but, nodejs, so it's worth it!
[16:30:40] <supsup> i've been messing with nodejs maybe i'll go to next one
[16:32:53] <ColKurtz> it's okay abjorn
[16:33:07] <ColKurtz> i'm sure it will be full of other neckbeards
[16:33:20] <coldhead> no geeks are really social
[16:33:48] <abjorn> lol
[16:33:48] <coldhead> or else they'd be out having rewarding social interaction and not obsessing over their gombuters
[16:33:54] <abjorn> I am not a neckbeard >=o
[16:33:57] <abjorn> just a geek
[16:33:59] <coldhead> but just have a few drinks
[16:34:01] <hobs> yep coldhead is right
[16:34:07] <hobs> twice now
[16:34:09] <abjorn> anyways, im off, later
[16:34:18] <abjorn> Well
[16:34:22] <abjorn> I *would* have a few drinks
[16:34:31] <abjorn> but I'm a tiny bit underage so I don't know how much they'll like that.
[16:34:43] <abjorn> anyways, bai
[16:34:51] <hobs> pregame
[16:36:12] <khmer> in FF < 4, how can i trigger a hidden <input type="file" /> to pop its dialog?
[16:36:39] <innociv> You can't
[16:41:06] <gnarf> you can place it above another element with opacity 0 though
[16:44:52] <irich> hola
[16:45:43] <irich> looking for something that will load the entire site and show an image or something while it loads; analogous to what you'd see @ http://www.generalassemb.ly/
[16:45:44] <irich> \
[16:47:26] <ColKurtz> that's not very user-friendly irich
[16:47:34] <irich> haha
[16:47:36] <irich> what you mean?
[16:47:42] <ColKurtz> users would rather start interacting with an incompletely downloaded website
[16:47:51] <ColKurtz> than sit waiting for a spinning bar to finish
[16:47:53] <irich> i smells that
[16:47:57] <irich> but in some projects
[16:48:05] <irich> you need 100 control
[16:48:05] <irich> no?
[16:48:31] <ColKurtz> no matter what kind of website
[16:48:41] <ColKurtz> as a user, if it is not user friendly, then it is off putting
[16:48:43] <ColKurtz> and that damages the brand
[16:49:02] <irich> totally agreement!
[16:49:22] <ColKurtz> most people who reach your website want to quickly contact you or ascertain wtf your website/company/etc. is about
[16:49:34] <ColKurtz> they don't care about some presentation
[16:49:42] <ColKurtz> for instance I closed general assembly before it finished loading
[16:49:44] <ColKurtz> it was taking FOREVER
[16:50:08] <irich> true
[16:50:11] <irich> you should let it load
[16:50:13] <irich> pretty rad place
[16:50:15] <irich> lol
[16:50:19] <irich> but again
[16:50:21] <irich> preaching to choir brotha
[16:50:25] <kawohi808> when i'm using ajax .load(), should I put the CSS reference in the file im using ajax on or the file that the file is being loaded to?
[16:50:36] <irich>  in total agreement with that philosophy
[16:50:43] <irich> and ive said that to my client
[16:50:45] <irich> but hey
[16:51:14] <ColKurtz> and there's no reason GA should have a loading bar....
[16:51:21] <irich> hahah
[16:51:30] <ColKurtz> that website is pretty average and lightweight
[16:51:33] <irich> write them a really thorough email!
[16:51:34] <ColKurtz> or should be
[16:53:15] <ColKurtz> kawohi808, the parent document that is calling ajax.load()
[16:53:38] <ColKurtz> what are you loading?
[16:53:41] <ColKurtz> what kind of data?
[16:54:15] <irich> lol are any of the job postings working for you guys on the hp?
[16:54:27] <kawohi808> just a form inside of an html file.
[16:54:36] <kawohi808> is what im loading.
[16:54:56] <kawohi808> I'm using fancybox and its just NOT working right for me.
[16:55:13] <ColKurtz> try colorbox
[16:55:28] <irich> kawohi808: what's not working
[16:55:30] <ColKurtz> that's my favorite b/c i think it has the most options/extensive api
[16:55:42] <ColKurtz> then again i haven't compared lightbox scripts in a long time
[16:55:58] <kawohi808> Well, i'll upload it live in dropbox... 1sec.
[16:57:59] <kawohi808> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html
[16:58:15] <innociv> How do I extend a function rather than replacing it?
[16:58:39] <kawohi808> When you click buy now, fancybox opens up with a form thats coming from form1.html or form.html
[16:58:56] <kawohi808> but at the first click, it doesn't load.
[16:59:06] <innociv> Like I have namespace.myFunction = function(){ //do stuff }  and I want to add more to that function in another file.  How would I do that?
[16:59:15] <kawohi808> Fancybox does, but not the form
[17:01:19] <thatryan> if I have a object with a date value formatted like 2011-05-07 02:41:43, how can I convert it to format like Sun Jun 19 2011 12:36:45
[17:05:41] <kawohi808> can anybody help? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html
[17:06:46] <thatryan> kawohi808: is there a question there?
[17:08:41] <bbrandon> kawohi808: that website is beautiful
[17:08:44] <kawohi808> No, its my problem. fancybox isn't loading the forms right
[17:08:53] <kawohi808> thank you
[17:09:13] <kawohi808> when you click buy now for the first time, the forms just stop working
[17:10:57] <sk8ball> I'm using asp.net... but I am wanting to create a usercontrol that dynamically loads a set of "list titles" from a table in a sql server database, then dynamically loads the list items associated with each list title.  I then want the user to be able to drag and drop list items between each list.  I then want to be able to persist the list item's new list title to the database... (don't care
[17:10:57] <sk8ball> so much about its position in the list).  Now I am able to achieve the drag and drop functionality via jquery's sortable but I can't seem to figure out how to best persist the list items new list title association to the database
[17:11:00] <sk8ball> ideas?
[17:17:19] <kawohi808> #dead
[17:18:00] <niftylettuce> hey fellas!
[17:18:25] <niftylettuce> quick question, if I have an object with indexes 0-10, and I want to return only indexes of 0-4, how might I accomplish that?
[17:19:10] <coldhead> .filter(':lt(5)')
[17:19:13] <niftylettuce> loop through object i <= 4, take each i and append to new obj, then overwrite the old?
[17:19:15] <coldhead> ?lt @ niftylettuce
[17:19:16] <bot-t> niftylettuce, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[17:19:37] <niftylettuce> coldhead: \o
[17:20:00] <coldhead> o/
[17:24:53] <ColKurtz> nifty lettuce, slice dat shit
[17:25:10] <ColKurtz> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[17:25:41] <ColKurtz> another tool for your box
[17:28:57] <Pio> im playing with the template plugin, and im trying to make one template wrap another.. but i cant get the data from the rendered template to pass-through to the wrapping template.. anyone have experience with this?
[17:30:43] <niftylettuce> coldhead: newPalettes: templatePalettes.filter(':lt('+reqColorCount+')') (error: "is not a function")
[17:30:47] <jedimind> wrapping templates within templates causes the space time continuum to collapse on itself
[17:31:03] <niftylettuce> ColKurtz: slice da shit?
[17:31:33] <innociv> I namespace.myFunction = function(){ //do stuff }  and I want to add more to that function in another file.  How would I do that?  I want to extend the function...
[17:31:33] <ColKurtz> slice allows you to specifically choose a range of elements
[17:31:36] <ColKurtz> like 4-8
[17:31:40] <ColKurtz> or 0-4
[17:31:44] <niftylettuce> ooOo I could do 0,4
[17:31:52] <niftylettuce> ColKurtz: <3
[17:32:16] <niftylettuce> coldhead: \o
[17:32:24] <niftylettuce> ColKurtz: \o **
[17:32:36] <ColKurtz> niftylettuce, o/
[17:40:27] <zakdrizzt> is there a more specific channel for JQuery UI stuff?
[17:42:45] <coldhead> niftylettuce: o\
[17:43:45] <innociv> Or let me better say what I want to do..  In one file I have "myFunction = function() { //do something }  $(..).click( myFunction() )" and in another file(loaded after) I want to add to what myFunction does...
[17:43:56] <innociv> So when that click calls myFunction it does more "stuff".
[17:45:57] <niftylettuce> ColKurtz: how do you slice an array?
[17:46:05] <coldhead> ?mdc slice
[17:46:05] <bot-t> coldhead, slice - MDC Docs - Returns a one-level deep copy of a portion of an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[17:46:48] <niftylettuce> coldhead: i got it
[17:46:52] <niftylettuce> ColKurtz: I got it
[17:46:53] <ColKurtz> that's normal js
[17:47:01] <niftylettuce> yeah I wasn't using array[0].slice
[17:47:04] <niftylettuce> I was using array.slice
[17:47:06] <niftylettuce> what a n000000b!
[17:47:14] <niftylettuce> ><
[17:47:23] <niftylettuce> been JS'ing for 10 hrs now
[17:47:41] <coldhead> it's my first day using JS too

[17:50:00] <coldhead> what is with the punctuation in that factoid?
[18:02:57] <abjorn> oh crap, coldhead is op
[18:05:58] <cornfeed> is there an easy way to check if the begining of a string is a certain character?
[18:06:13] <cornfeed> rather the end of the string
[18:06:27] <abjorn> yourstring.slice(0, 1) === yourcharacter
[18:06:33] <abjorn> or substr
[18:06:38] <abjorn> either one, same thing
[18:06:46] <cornfeed> is there a regex one?
[18:06:51] <cornfeed> :D
[18:06:58] <abjorn> you can match regexes...
[18:07:08] <cornfeed> slice, that is what i was thinking of
[18:07:28] <abjorn> You wouldn't need something like slice if you're just going to check regex
[18:07:30] <cornfeed> regex you say?
[18:07:43] <cornfeed> (slice in reference to last char)
[18:08:56] <cornfeed> is there a built in regex or a plugin, when i googled i only found references to plugins...
[18:09:16] <coldhead> ?eval "lol aids".match(/^lo/)

[18:13:13] <smik> Any idea why my CORS GET request with Authorization (or PUT requests)
[18:13:14] <smik>        are getting converted to OPTION requests while using $.ajax?

[18:14:42] <coldhead> good job, thx babe
[18:15:21] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/7/ okay this SORT OF works.
[18:15:27] <innociv> But I can't do ns.myFunction2 = ns.myFunction.extend(function () {
[18:15:36] <coldhead> ?sop @ smik
[18:15:36] <bot-t> smik, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[18:15:41] <coldhead> it's not that?
[18:15:51] <smik> no
[18:16:00] <smik> I'm doing CORS
[18:16:21] <smik> I've set the headers in the .htaccess
[18:16:46] <coldhead> i don't know if jQuery allows that
[18:16:51] <coldhead> gnarf?
[18:17:10] <smik> It does allow simple GET
[18:19:06] <smik> My POSTS requests are also getting converted into OPTION
[18:19:35] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/9/ I don't really get why this doesn't work.
[18:20:17] <innociv> LOL oops
[18:20:21] <innociv> It works exactly right
[18:20:21] <innociv> Wow
[18:22:01] <coldhead> smik: this looks relevant http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1099787/jquery-ajax-post-sending-options-as-request-method-in-firefox
[18:22:16] <coldhead> i don't know enough to know if it's useful soz
[18:23:19] <smik> Hmm, relevant but not the problem sover
[18:23:26] <smik> solver* shit what is wrong with me
[18:24:45] <jferg> anyone know why a checkbox might work fine in IE and FF but not even be selectable in Chrome?  Not seeing any errors in consle
[18:24:49] <al3xnull> Does anyone know why this is not following through with the Ajax? It's simply following the form action instead. https://gist.github.com/1041698
[18:25:11] <jferg> http://www.inkfile.me/quickcorps2/form-order-now/
[18:26:43] <al3xnull> If I get my ajax to work, it submits no values to the backend.
[18:33:08] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/11/  So.. I got my function extend working, which is awesome.  But I have a particament..  I have functions bound inside dynamic objects.  How would I actually change all that board.open function, for example for all current instances AND future instances of it?..
[18:35:34] <salazr> smik coldhead  had to work around a very similar issue with a web app running inside Facebook.. ended up just doing jsonp all over the place, much easier in the end
[18:36:20] <smik> salazr: The point is that it works in some other application. I'll probably ask that person how he made CORS work
[18:36:32] <salazr> right.. yea
[18:37:37] <schnoomac> I am currently using .draggable() on an element. Is their a way to make all its siblings not draggable? I have buttons with bindings on the div i made draggable and now the buttons are draggable which i don't want.
[18:37:46] <smik> I think I found it
[18:37:51] <smik> Yes I did
[18:38:10] <smik> Fuck
[18:38:11] <smik> I did
[18:38:13] <smik> I did
[18:38:14] <smik> :)
[18:38:26] <supsup> anyone can help me learn how to arrayize a array of objects based on keys? I gave it a pretty good attempt here but need help http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/4/
[18:38:29] <smik> I'm sorry, it's just that it has been 8 hours debugging it
[18:38:44] <supsup> there is expected return value at very end
[18:40:38] <smik> Lesson learned: When you do Basic Authentication on some resource that has to be accessed by CORS, you have to remove the Authentication for OPTIONS and HEAD by using LimitExcept
[18:42:07] <coldhead> good work, smik
[18:42:17] <coldhead> my take home message is "never do any authenticated ajax stuff"
[18:42:20] <coldhead> "ever"
[18:45:06] <coldhead> schnoomac: i don't think making an element draggable should make it's siblings draggable. can you paste your code?
[18:45:11] <coldhead> ?p @ schnoomac
[18:45:11] <bot-t> schnoomac, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[18:45:53] <schnoomac> Don't worry it does work. I just found out that you can use { cancel: 'a, textarea' } as an option to make those elements not draggable :)
[18:46:03] <coldhead> good job
[18:46:06] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/11/  I got my function extend working, which is awesome.  But I have a predicament: I have functions bound inside dynamic objects.  How would I actually change all that board.open function, for example for all current instances AND future instances of it?
[18:48:30] <coldhead> supsup: can you update your jsfiddle to show the transformation you want in the innermost loop? i can't quite see what you're after
[18:48:34] <coldhead> or why you want that
[18:53:27] <gnarf> coldhead: allows what?
[18:53:40] <coldhead> i don't even know, man
[18:53:46] <coldhead> what is CORS?
[18:54:04] <coldhead> something about GETs being converted to OPTIONs across domains
[18:54:08] <coldhead> it made me feel very tired
[18:58:13] <smik> HI gnarf
[18:58:20] <smik> It was my question
[18:58:38] <gnarf> oh
[18:58:43] <gnarf> i don't know anything bout it
[18:58:59] <smik> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6446592/not-able-to-access-authorization-required-resource-with-jquerys-ajax
[19:04:57] <supsup> i think i figured out my problem i posted earlier about how to arrayize individual keys from an array of objects... just listing here in case anyone was interested....main issue is i have to create global variables ;0( http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/6/
[19:06:02] <coldhead> i was interested, thx supsup
[19:06:47] <supsup> coldhead: i doubt its the best solution....there is prob some very simple way to do this
[19:08:56] <resting> i need to pass an a link element to this function:
[19:08:58] <resting> function load_course_details(nid, element) {
[19:09:18] <resting> then i used $(element).addClass('active_course'); in the function...but its not working
[19:09:30] <resting> any idea whats wrong?
[19:09:43] <Crum> hi
[19:09:48] <Crum> does anyone here use textwrangler?
[19:10:30] <Crum> is there a way to get the inertial scrolling smooth in textwrangler? It's very rigid because it scrolls discretely, one line at a time.
[19:11:41] <coldhead> supsup: if you're sticking around i'll see if i can find a cleaner way to do it?
[19:12:28] <supsup> sure.
[19:12:45] <supsup> main problem is have to dynamically create vars
[19:12:53] <supsup> to push to the return array
[19:13:00] <supsup> or so i think
[19:13:26] <supsup> only way to do that without adding to global scope is to use eval
[19:13:55] <supsup> unless there is a way to just not create temp vars and add it on the fly to the sub-index of the return value
[19:15:03] <supsup> current way tho can clobber global scope hah .  perhaps someone will do:  arrayize(array_of_objs, ["a","$"]);
[19:15:46] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/12/  I've figured out how to extend a basic function, but how can I ended that board.open() function?  the board namespace is really making it forum.rows[args.id].open().   I need a simple way to extend it. :/
[19:17:58] <Greed> This may or may not be of any use, innociv, but you can obtain the same effect with one line of code.
[19:18:01] <Greed> .clone()
[19:18:11] <innociv> Ehhh?
[19:18:15] <innociv> clone clones elements..
[19:18:21] <Null_> anyone here use or recommend ajaxy?
[19:19:13] <innociv> Clone has absolutely nothing to do with what I'm saying, I don't think
[19:21:38] <resting> how do i pass the clicked link element to a javascript function?
[19:22:47] <innociv> function( this ); ?..
[19:24:15] <resting> its passing the window object instead
[19:24:24] <innociv> ?
[19:24:58] <innociv> myFunction = function( element ) { console.log(element); }   $('a').click(function(){ myFunction(this); }
[19:25:49] <resting> i have myFunction = function( element ) { console.log(element); }
[19:25:55] <coldhead> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/8/ ?
[19:26:48] <resting> but i'm calling the function with <a href="function(this);"> instead
[19:26:55] <supsup> looking
[19:26:56] <innociv> ..... well don't do that?
[19:27:11] <resting> use this? $('a').click(function(){ myFunction(this); }
[19:27:13] <supsup> yah..nice
[19:27:50] <coldhead> what do you need this for anyway, supsup?
[19:28:13] <supsup> stupid JSON object i can't fix
[19:28:28] <supsup> because they won't let me fix their backend code
[19:28:51] <coldhead> supsup: maybe relevant: http://jsonselect.org/
[19:28:52] <innociv> Haha
[19:29:31] <iszak> coldhead, it's an abomination!3
[19:30:20] <iszak> pretty cool stuff
[19:30:36] <supsup> hurm there is i think one problem with your code and mine we assume there will always be the same amound of items in each object
[19:30:52] <coldhead> do we?
[19:31:49] <supsup> nm my works
[19:31:53] <supsup> urs does not! ;-0
[19:31:57] <supsup> but i'm sure u can fix it
[19:32:02] <supsup> here i will show u ane xample
[19:32:12] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/10/
[19:32:30] <supsup> vs http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/11/
[19:33:11] <supsup> u assume there will always be the same amount of properties -- but maybe that is what makes yours dynamic.
[19:33:25] <patbam> $('a#someid').trigger('click')  should go to a#someid's href, yes?
[19:33:31] <coldhead> mine just pushes undefined if an object is missing a key
[19:33:38] <joasssko> hi!
[19:33:39] <supsup> ahh yah.
[19:33:54] <joasssko> does anyone speak spanish?
[19:34:22] <coldhead> susp
[19:34:31] <coldhead> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/JJVFx/12/ ?
[19:34:34] <coldhead> is that fixed?
[19:35:05] <supsup> ya
[19:35:15] <supsup> nice... man wonder why i can't think of solution like that
[19:35:30] <supsup> fail i guess ;0(
[19:35:51] <coldhead> i wouldn't have come up with that without yours as a prototype
[19:36:04] <coldhead> everything usually takes two attemps
[19:36:07] <coldhead> t
[19:36:08] <supsup> i'll run them through perf now and see which one is faster.
[19:36:17] <supsup> tho prob need a bigger object
[19:36:19] <abjorn> well
[19:36:22] <abjorn> that meetup was fun
[19:36:23] <supsup> for valid test...or bigger array of objects
[19:36:24] <abjorn> ya shoulda gone supsup
[19:36:29] <coldhead> back already abjorn !
[19:36:31] <supsup> i/m still at work dude.
[19:36:33] <abjorn> well, idk about fun, but it was good!
[19:36:38] <abjorn> wow wtf supsup lol
[19:36:41] <abjorn> what hours do you work?
[19:36:41] <supsup> lols
[19:36:51] <supsup> of late foreverz
[19:37:01] <abjorn> graveyard shift or what? lol
[19:37:10] <supsup> tho granted what i'm doing now has very little to do with work -- i could of did a ez hack solution
[19:37:15] <supsup> i just choose to learn more
[19:37:20] <joasssko> how can i remove an attribute to a <li> that has children without removing the attribute of this childrens?
[19:37:21] <abjorn> word, always a good thing
[19:37:23] <coldhead> were you at least as socially awkward as everyone else there, abjorn ?
[19:37:28] <abjorn> less so actually
[19:37:38] <coldhead> HA!
[19:37:48] <coldhead> IN YOUR FACE AWKWARD NERDS
[19:37:54] <abjorn> It wasn't too bad. If you get me in the right crowd with people who have the same interests as me, I can be sociable.
[19:38:07] <coldhead> no doubt
[19:38:13] <supsup> i'll prob try to go next time.
[19:38:13] <abjorn> You just have to give me half an hour to warm up lol
[19:38:22] <coldhead> and booze?
[19:38:39] <abjorn> I ended up talking to a few guys about game programming and js, specially game programming and node, obviously.
[19:38:42] <abjorn> Nah, there was no booze.
[19:39:08] <joasssko> how can i remove an attribute to a <li> that has children without removing the attribute of this childrens? can anybody help me please?
[19:39:08] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/12/  I've figured out how to extend a basic function, but how can I ended that board.open() function?  the board namespace is really making it forum.rows[args.id].open().   I need a simple way to extend it. :/
[19:39:38] <innociv> I don't get your question.  If you just remove a li's attribute it should noly remove that li's attribute
[19:39:42] <innociv> assuming you select the right li
[19:40:05] <abjorn> coldhead: The first talk was from a guy who works at Nodejitsu, which was neat :O
[19:40:19] <coldhead> oh cool
[19:40:23] <abjorn> Guy is clearly very experienced with Node
[19:40:40] <abjorn> Most of the people there had little to no experience with it
[19:40:46] <abjorn> I had more than most, which is sad lol
[19:40:57] <joasssko> im using Wordpress to and i need to expand and colapse some menues
[19:41:09] <supsup> i've set it up and played around with it, tried to get it to run on my website but failed ;/
[19:41:14] <abjorn> word, joasssko
[19:41:42] <abjorn> supsup: As in get it to run on your shared hosting? rofl
[19:41:46] <supsup> it seems to be a lot easier to get to work locally than on a live server
[19:41:47] <abjorn> that'll neeevver work
[19:41:59] <supsup> why not
[19:42:08] <abjorn> Shared hosting generally does not give you enough access
[19:42:12] <supsup> i have a vm i should be able to !
[19:42:13] <coldhead> its pretty new
[19:42:17] <abjorn> They usually lock you into jailshell
[19:42:18] <supsup> root bro root
[19:42:20] <innociv> joasssko, still unclear
[19:42:30] <abjorn> Oh, so not a shared hosting, a VPS?
[19:42:38] <supsup> i'll get it to work ....one of these days!
[19:42:39] <abjorn> Weird, I have it working on my VPS no problemo
[19:42:59] <coldhead> don't you work for a hosting company?
[19:43:00] <innociv> You talking about node.js?
[19:43:05] <supsup> been messing around with groovy too much but i want to know more node also
[19:43:07] <kborchers> joasssko so u have nested lists and only want to change attr of say top level li?
[19:43:07] <abjorn> Yeah, so? :p
[19:43:15] <abjorn> Yeah, innociv
[19:43:18] <innociv> Ah
[19:43:23] <abjorn> I just got back from a NodeJS Meetup
[19:43:24] <innociv> I use ajax push engine, which is rather similar.
[19:43:39] <innociv> serverside js with cometd and all
[19:44:04] <coldhead> i feel bad for groovy, it's obsolete
[19:44:08] <kborchers> ?demo @ joasssko
[19:44:09] <bot-t> joasssko, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:44:20] <joasssko> www.kingfisheradvisory.com/wp on the sidebar at "Services"
[19:44:42] <joasssko> i need to expand and collapse this submenu
[19:44:44] <abjorn> There was a guy from Nodejitsu who did a presentation on Node's strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. Then there was a guy who works at the company this took place at (GameSalad) who did a presentation on Socket.io and NowJS
[19:44:56] <supsup> cold lol it saying urs is 80 percent faster
[19:45:06] <joasssko> but on removing the attr href on the li parent
[19:45:14] <joasssko> it's remove on the childs too
[19:45:40] <innociv> Is it on the web, abjorn?
[19:45:54] <innociv> I'd be using node.js if I wasn't already using ape.
[19:47:03] <kborchers> joasssko how r u currently selecting the li? just $('li') ?
[19:47:04] <supsup> http://jsperf.com/cold-vs-supsup   will have to review this more tommorow to find out which call is so slow.  would be cool if jsperf told u time in each function but i guess that would artificaully slow down the test?
[19:47:49] <joasssko> nope, im selecting the class of that li
[19:49:08] <abjorn> innociv: It's going to be at some point
[19:49:21] <supsup> why is groovy obsolete?
[19:49:22] <innociv> I'd like to watch it
[19:49:33] <abjorn> innociv: Although the second talk was mostly just code and examples rather than slides so it wouldn't be very useful.
[19:49:43] <coldhead> because there are other scriptish languages for the JVM which will be more popular
[19:49:54] <coldhead> jRuby, jython, scala, clojure
[19:50:04] <supsup> grails is built on top of groovy
[19:50:07] <supsup> it's pretty cool
[19:50:11] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/12/  I've figured out how to extend a basic function, but how can I ended that board.open() function?  the board namespace is really making it forum.rows[args.id].open().   I need a simple way to add more to the functio
[19:50:12] <coldhead> yeah i know
[19:50:15] <innociv> n
[19:50:16] <coldhead> that's why it's a shame
[19:50:31] <resting> innociv: it works !! thanks!!
[19:50:42] <innociv> Welcome
[19:50:47] <coldhead> resting: now you help innociv with her problem :)
[19:50:51] <innociv> LOL
[19:51:27] <abjorn> It's a trade!
[19:51:49] <innociv> I wish one of you would help
[19:51:49] <resting> coldhead: lol....i doubt i could...wasn't paying attention in this chat previously either
[19:51:52] <innociv> It's a tough question..
[19:51:53] <kborchers> joasssko can u show me your code that removes that attr?
[19:52:12] <supsup> cold i'll check out that Json library u were talking about earlier tommorow
[19:52:17] <abjorn> I'll take a looksee innociv
[19:52:25] <abjorn> But I'm pretty tired so no guarantees lol
[19:52:28] <coldhead> too tough for me innociv, sorry
[19:53:13] <resting> extending a function...can't help either...
[19:53:20] <abjorn> I don't think I really understand your question, innociv
[19:53:25] <innociv> I'm tired to.  This is keeping me awake
[19:53:33] <innociv> abjorn, well see how I'm extending myFunction?
[19:53:35] <abjorn> mhm
[19:53:39] <innociv> Now I need to extend board.open()
[19:53:44] <supsup> i'm about to roll out and get some food !
[19:53:48] <innociv> but board is forum.rows[args.id]
[19:54:10] <joasssko> kborchers jQuery(document).ready(function(){    $('.page-item-12 a').removeAttr("href")  });   $('.page-item-12').click(function() {   $('.children').slideDown('slow', function() {  }); });
[19:54:12] <innociv> it's a function within an object created dynamically
[19:54:44] <innociv> I don't see how to extend board.open()
[19:54:48] <supsup> ooo man cold u should see how fast these graphs draw now ;-0.
[19:55:35] <abjorn> innociv: I don't see why your Function.prototype.extend wouldn't work
[19:56:14] <kborchers> joasssko try $('.page-item-12 a:first').removeAttr("href");
[19:56:25] <innociv> abjorn well I'd have to do forum.rows[args.id].open() = forum.rows[args.id].open().extend(function(){ ... });
[19:56:32] <innociv>  I need to extend every board.open()
[19:56:38] <innociv> that's already made, and future ones
[19:57:22] <innociv> extending past ones would be doable with $.each( forum.rows ... )  but that doesn't help for future ones.
[19:57:57] <abjorn> I guess you'll need to make board a proper JavaScript object then, where the base object has a prototype.open, then extend that prototype.open
[19:58:06] <abjorn> a proper templated javascript object that is
[19:58:21] <abjorn> new Board() or so
[19:59:06] <innociv> I'm not sure how.  But, I would think that the best thing to do would be to have board.open() = { function... something to hook on }.  Ugh. I have no idea.
[19:59:10] <innociv> This is a bit beyond me.
[19:59:19] <supsup> take it ez all
[20:00:11] <abjorn> Well, you can create something like function Board(args...) { somecodehere }
[20:00:11] <abjorn> Then Board.prototype.open = function () { youropencodehere);
[20:00:11] <abjorn> Then Board.prototype.open = Board.prototype.extend(function () { blablabla });
[20:00:17] <supsup> i forgot on IRC people tend to not like that kind of type.  take it easy!  some guy was trolling me yesterday for that.
[20:00:30] <abjorn> haha
[20:00:53] <abjorn> innociv: Then when you add to the forum boards just add it as a new Board();
[20:01:20] <abjorn> here, hold on, I'll edit your jsfiddle
[20:01:32] <innociv> Somewhat following until the last line
[20:02:38] <innociv> I'm currently creating one of those options with forum.addRow(topic,'topic'); clearly enough.  Instead I'd do something like forum.rows[args.id] = new Board(topic, 'topic'); ?
[20:02:54] <abjorn> innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/Xnxhe/13/
[20:02:55] <abjorn> Do you see what I mean?
[20:03:19] <innociv> Will the this actually work in scope then?
[20:03:30] <abjorn> Yeah, it should just fine
[20:03:43] <innociv> Okay.  A lot of code to change.  I'll check it tomorrow.
[20:04:02] <innociv> If that works it's great.
[20:04:07] <abjorn> Although, personally, I don't see why you would want to extend a function like that.
[20:04:16] <innociv> Super secret!
[20:04:18] <abjorn> lol
[20:04:29] <innociv> I'll show you when i'm done.  It's pretty awesome.
[20:05:03] <joasssko> kborchers it works when i try on jsfiddle but on my site doesnt
[20:05:24] <kborchers> hmm
[20:05:29] <abjorn> I mean, if you're going to have some sort of object hierarchy where you have an inheriting object that overrides a method but still needs to call the parent method, you might as well use some kind of OOP Class system like jresig's simple inheritance thing
[20:06:05] <innociv> Well, it's mainly because I want it to be easy for people to add to functions for plugins.  Another thing is to have a back layer and top layer of code.
[20:06:31] <abjorn> innociv: Then using a Class-like inheritance system like what I mentioned would actually work better.
[20:06:34] <innociv> The problem with inhertitance is it's a child.  I'm actually changing the parent.
[20:06:41] <kborchers> try $('.page-item-12').children('a').removeAttr("href");
[20:07:11] <innociv> $('page-item-12 >a').removeAttr('href'); is the same
[20:07:17] <innociv> > a*
[20:07:19] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:3: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
[20:07:26] <abjorn> I'm assuming you're working on some sort of forums system, innociv?
[20:08:49] <kborchers> true innociv, joasssko you can do either way. innociv's is cleaner
[20:08:58] <joasssko> kborchers it's work
[20:09:08] <kborchers> cool
[20:09:11] <abjorn> Although kborchers is faster
[20:09:18] <joasssko> thnkz bro!
[20:09:47] <abjorn> I wouldn't think giving plugins the ability to make changes to a parent class like that would be very wise, innociv :o That would mean a plugin could negatively affect functionality elsewhere
[20:10:24] <joasssko> i was trying with .parent() and that didnt work
[20:10:38] <joasssko> i tried ewith :parent
[20:10:54] <joasssko> or using the children
[20:11:08] <joasssko> but this worked perfect
[20:11:12] <joasssko> thnkz again
[20:11:16] <joasssko> bye!
[20:18:30] <abjorn> innociv: But I guess that's just me :P Of course I also wouldn't do it because I wouldn't want to figure out that particular architecture issue haha
[20:19:20] <abjorn> I tend to think if an issue is difficult enough that it really needs to prove it's worth before I should bother to take the time figuring it out.
[20:26:53] <Whirl3d> Good Evening all. Quick question about .animate...how do I animate the opacity of an object using one type of easing and the position of the same object using another type of easing at the same time.
[20:27:53] <zivester> animate them successively with the same duration?
[20:28:06] <lathan> Whirl3d, I haven't used animate that much. if you chain them together do they queue one after the other?

[20:31:00] <milardovich> Hello guys
[20:31:28] <kborchers> ?hi @ milardovich
[20:31:29] <bot-t> Hey milardovich
[20:32:32] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/qjywn101 <-- I have this form, and I would like to make a simple script with Jquery, that when the users click in one of the fields it cleans its value. Any suggestions?
[20:33:02] <lathan> milardovich, define "clean"
[20:33:08] <lathan> what do you want it to do
[20:33:12] <lathan> remove html entities
[20:33:18] <lathan> reset the field
[20:33:19] <lathan> .....
[20:33:36] <milardovich> yes, sorry, I mean reset the field, turn the value on empty
[20:33:44] <abjorn> http://goo.gl/JHBfr ...my mind literally cannot comprehend this.
[20:34:01] <lathan> milardovich, use jsfiddle, its better for testing: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/j7fxg/
[20:34:10] <milardovich> aha
[20:34:28] <lathan> milardovich, you want the click event handler and the val function
[20:34:32] <lathan> ?click@ milardovich

[20:35:29] <kborchers> lathan stop confusing poor bot-t ;)
[20:35:38] <lathan> lol
[20:35:52] <lathan> I was trying to get the full signature definition of .val(newValue)
[20:35:55] <milardovich> xD
[20:36:02] <lathan> bot-t: is it okay that I use you alot?
[20:36:21] <milardovich> I think I got it
[20:36:23] <milardovich> wait
[20:36:25] <bot-t> lathan, Cannot predict now.
[20:36:44] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/8mjTMs5n <-- it works, but only for inputs
[20:36:59] <milardovich> can I make something to add also textareas without writing all that again?
[20:37:15] <lathan> milardovich, $('.form-request').find('input, textarea, select')
[20:37:29] <milardovich> let's see
[20:37:32] <lathan> ^^ also select menus.....
[20:37:46] <lathan> milardovich, use jsfiddle, so much nicer for testing javscript
[20:37:50] <lathan> *javascript
[20:38:12] <milardovich> ok

[20:42:31] <Assimilater> hey all, i was skimming across some work in stack overflow that i'd like to duplicate, but it was written for 1.4 and i'm using 1.6 and there appear to be some problems
[20:42:34] <Assimilater> here's the stack overflow
[20:42:35] <Assimilater> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2208480/jquery-date-picker-to-show-month-year-only/3577645#3577645
[20:42:54] <Assimilater> here's how it works with 1.4 http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/wThbN/
[20:43:07] <Assimilater> and in the next fiddle, as soon as i make it will show that the year dropbox does not appear in 1.6
[20:46:19] <tbranyen> fawk
[20:47:16] <abjorn> I know, right?
[20:47:34] <ElGoorf> im looking for how to submit an imaginary form with post, but not like ajax, im after a complete page redirect
[20:47:36] <ElGoorf> how is this done?
[20:47:51] <tbranyen> ElGoorf: make a real form
[20:47:52] <tbranyen> and submit it
[20:48:13] <abjorn> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/AudioQuest+-+Chocolate+65.6'+HDMI+Cable+-+Platinum+White/9892794.p?id=1218202121644&skuId=9892794&st=hdmi&cp=1&lp=3 lol what okay now this is just beyond ridiculous
[20:48:19] <tbranyen> $("<form action='/some-page'>").appendTo("body").submit() ?
[20:48:30] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/wThbN/2/
[20:48:32] <Assimilater> there we go
[20:48:38] <Assimilater> sorry that took a while longer than i expected
[20:49:02] <Assimilater> as you can see the year combobox appears as the control is being closed, instead of when it is being opened
[20:49:52] <ElGoorf> tbranyen, is that for real? i was expectign something like the post() function
[20:50:06] <ElGoorf> ie enter a destination and the data
[20:51:49] <tbranyen> ElGoorf: you can change it to post if you want
[20:51:51] <lathan> tbranyen, do you even need to append it to the body?
[20:52:01] <lathan> ElGoorf, if you do a $.post, then its a background 'AJAX' call
[20:52:18] <ElGoorf> i know this
[20:52:24] <tbranyen> lathan: guess not
[20:52:31] <ElGoorf> what im askign for is if theres a similar funcion that doesnt us ajax, but instead just takes you to the page
[20:52:39] <ElGoorf> ugh, excuse my typing
[20:52:39] <ElGoorf> >.<
[20:52:54] <lathan> ElGoorf, the fake form and triggering the submit is the best option
[20:52:59] <lathan> ?ditto @ tbranyen
[20:53:03] <Assimilater> window.location.href?
[20:53:10] <lathan> Assimilater, that only does a get request
[20:53:14] <ElGoorf> ok, ty
[20:53:23] <Assimilater> i heard takes you to the link
[20:53:26] <Assimilater> to me that sounds like a redirect
[20:53:40] <ElGoorf> assimilater, but with the post data?
[20:53:45] <Assimilater> ah
[20:55:18] <coreyo> when I do a $.ajax() or $.getJSON() call, I noticed that the data is released from memory once the callback function is finished.  Is there a way for me to retrieve my data then allow it to persist via a local variable after the call?
[20:56:18] <tbranyen> var data; $.getJSON("url", function(obj) { data = obj; fun(); }); function fun() { console.log(data); }
[20:56:21] <tbranyen> coreyo: ^^
[20:56:36] <SirFunk> how do i stop an ajaxError from bubbling up the dom?
[20:57:25] <lathan> coreyo, inside thte function, set an outside variable...
[20:57:25] <lathan> var perm; $.post(....function(data){ perm = data; })
[20:57:40] <Assimilater> same as tbranyen said
[20:57:46] <lathan> SirFunk, can you put an error function with a event.stopPropagation() ?
[20:57:48] <Assimilater> anyone get to look at my "month picker"
[20:57:57] <coreyo> lathan, that doesn't work, the variable becomes null as soon as the callback function ends.  I've tried it several different ways.
[20:58:08] <tbranyen> coreyo: because you're trying to do it synchronously
[20:58:20] <SirFunk> lathan: i'm trying to catch it in $.ajax's error property... which doesn't pass the event to the function?
[20:58:21] <tbranyen> you cannot just continue execution after a getJSON call has been made
[20:58:38] <tbranyen> coreyo: you must continue all execution from inside that callback
[20:58:46] <tbranyen> or call out to another functin from that callback
[20:58:48] <lathan> SirFunk, try return false in the error function
[20:58:50] <tbranyen> but it must come from that
[20:59:01] <coreyo> tbranyen, that's exactly what I was trying to avoid
[20:59:10] <tbranyen> coreyo: then you picked the wrong language/technology
[20:59:12] <tbranyen> :-/
[20:59:18] <tbranyen> because thats how async coding works
[20:59:27] <SirFunk> lathan: still bubbling
[20:59:51] <tbranyen> SirFunk: even with an explicit stopPropagation?
[20:59:54] <tbranyen> that seems unlikely
[21:00:12] <SirFunk> i have event.stopPropagation(); return false;
[21:00:14] <SirFunk> still doing it
[21:00:27] <tbranyen> SirFunk: and you are defining event?
[21:00:32] <coreyo> tbranyen, basically, I'm creating a type of data table class.    I want to be able to make a request then store/cache the data in the object.  Is there a simple way to clone the data in another object?
[21:00:33] <tbranyen> in the callback arguments
[21:00:46] <SirFunk> tbranyen: no, the callback doesn't get an event option
[21:01:01] <lathan> coreyo, this works: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Akbja/
[21:01:04] <tbranyen> SirFunk: so where is the event variable coming from?
[21:01:11] <SirFunk> tbranyen: no clue
[21:01:26] <SirFunk> according to jquery $.ajax error gets: error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[21:01:32] <SirFunk> none of those are events
[21:01:40] <lathan> correct
[21:01:59] <lathan> is this because you are binding to the global ajaxError event?
[21:02:01] <tbranyen> SirFunk: wrong
[21:02:06] <tbranyen> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[21:02:07] <lathan> SirFunk,              ^^^^
[21:02:12] <lathan> (my previous)
[21:02:24] <lathan> tbranyen, no, that's the global ajaxerror
[21:02:30] <tbranyen> lathan: opposed to what?
[21:02:31] <lathan> tbranyen, he's trying to stop it in the local error function
[21:02:43] <tbranyen> those are callbacks? they don't bubble??
[21:02:57] <SirFunk> lathan: yes i am.. i want to catch any random errors globally .. but some ajax functions i want speciffic error responses and when there's a specific response i don't want the global to fire too
[21:03:01] <lathan> tbranyen, he wants to stop the global ajaxerror event from happening
[21:03:09] <tbranyen> then bind to and cancel it...
[21:03:12] <tbranyen> why is this complicated?
[21:03:15] <lathan> SirFunk, you could try doing .one('ajaxError',function(){ return false; });
[21:03:21] <lathan> SirFunk, its a hack, but it might work
[21:03:24] <lathan> ?tias @ SirFunk
[21:03:49] <SirFunk> hmm
[21:03:54] <tbranyen> bot-t is dead
[21:03:56] <tbranyen> long live bot-t
[21:03:57] <lathan> again?
[21:04:16] <tbranyen> yeah i'm thinking might be time for a new bot :-/
[21:04:25] <lathan> or at least a new installation
[21:04:57] <SirFunk> tbranyen: how do you bind to it?
[21:06:28] <lathan> SirFunk, $().one('ajaxError',function(){ return false; })
[21:06:45] <lathan> SirFunk, do that right inside your ajax error function, and it *should* just cancel your one error handler
[21:07:02] <coreyo> lathan, check private dialogue
[21:07:28] <lathan> no pms plz
[21:07:34] <lathan> I'm about to get off anyway
[21:08:14] <SirFunk> lathan: that works.. seems kinda hackish.. but it works
[21:08:51] <lathan> SirFunk, be careful, I'm not sure if multiple errors in the same way will break it
[21:09:09] <lathan> SirFunk, try binding it normally, but putting a check for that url or something in the ajax request
[21:09:42] <abjorn> well, bed time for me
[21:09:45] <abjorn> night ya'll
[21:10:05] <lathan> ditto
[21:10:12] <lathan> bye folks
[21:11:51] <Assimilater> can anyone help me figure out why this code written for 1.4: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2208480/jquery-date-picker-to-show-month-year-only/3577645#3577645 doesn't work for this application in 1.6? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/wThbN/2/
[21:12:08] <Assimilater> the year combobox doesn't appear as an option when the control initially loads
[21:13:54] <astropirate> #jquerymobile is dead so pardon me as i ask my question here: how can i reload/refresh a page in jquerymobile? in specific i want it to change the theme
[21:16:23] <tbranyen> astropirate: if you just want to refresh, use location.reload()
[21:17:00] <astropirate> tbranyen, sorry i meant re-render
[21:17:06] <astropirate> but i think i figured it out! thanks
[21:17:31] <Assimilater> tbranyen: can you help me with this ui issue?
[21:23:56] <letterpress> with jquery 1.6.x i have some animations that get out of sync if i leave the browser window open for a while (like more than 10 minutes). in previous versions these worked fine. anyone know any info on this issue?
[21:44:10] <Cluber1> .
[21:52:57] <quuxman> For some reason a $.post() call is showing up as an 'OPTIONS' request in Firebug. What's up?
[21:53:40] <quuxman> I am making the request to another domain. Do I have to populate a <form> tag in an <iframe> instead?
[21:54:33] <Cork> quuxman: you can't comunicate cross domain in an iframe eather
[21:54:43] <Cork> only way is if the server support jsonp
[21:55:32] <Cork> (and your data will be sent as get variables)
[21:56:01] <quuxman> you can totally submit a form to another domain
[21:56:10] <Cork> quuxman: btw no, sorry an ifram should work, as you create the form your self
[21:56:34] <quuxman> I already do that in other places. I could even use JavaScript to construct the iframe and the form, but what a pain
[21:56:34] <Cork> quuxman: ya, its if you load the from from another domain that its blocked
[21:57:20] <Cork> quuxman: but ajax can't do cross domain calls at all
[21:57:46] <Cork> quuxman: so iframe or <script src=""></script> tags is all that can be used
[21:58:00] <Cork> (that last is jsonp)
[21:58:56] <quuxman> I have to include POST data for this case
[21:59:10] <quuxman> so jsonp is out
[21:59:31] <Cork> ya, the only option is iframe from your domain
[22:03:02] <quuxman> fuckit I'll just do a regular form and a redirect
[22:05:57] <ryanseddon> you can do cross domain ajax calls just not in all browsers
[22:06:36] <ryanseddon> it's even built into jQuery to handle CORS ajax
[22:07:23] <Cork> ryanseddon: all modern browsers block cross domain ajax
[22:07:40] <ryanseddon> Which ones?
[22:07:57] <Cork> chrome/chromium, firefox, opera at least
[22:08:04] <ryanseddon> AS long as the header is set to accept cross domaon calls all modern browsers do it
[22:08:20] <Cork> ya, but that doesn't work in slitly older browsers
[22:08:32] <Cork> so its a way to do it in the future, but unreliable for now
[22:09:29] <Buffon> hi, What's the best book to learn JQuery?

[22:36:34] <khurram> hi every one
[22:37:04] <khurram> i am new to wordpress and i have lots of confusions and question please can some one guide in proper direction for the tasks below
[22:37:32] <coldhead> this is #jQuery, not #wordpress
[22:37:46] <khurram> ah sorry
[22:37:52] <khurram> hey coldhead i miss you maan
[22:38:00] <coldhead> you too babe
[22:38:07] <coldhead> but right now i am having a nose bleed
[22:41:13] <khurram> coldhead: check this site http://khurram.yaqeenitrades.com  i have problem with very large json
[22:42:17] <khurram> coldhead: the json does show the id and the content in the firebug but upon clicking it says id not defined ?
[22:42:37] <khurram> coldhead: check the testing all tag
[22:43:35] <coldhead> i'm checking
[22:44:24] <premapix> Can anyone educate the ignorant -- this is a snip of gallery code but doesn't look like normal JQuery
[22:44:24] <premapix>  var thisCurrentSlide="";
[22:44:24] <premapix> ;(function($) {
[22:44:24] <premapix> 	// Globally keep track of all images by their unique hash.  Each item is an image data object.
[22:44:24] <premapix> 	var allImages = {};
[22:44:24] <premapix> 	var imageCounter = 0;
[22:44:25] <premapix> 	// Galleriffic static class
[22:44:25] <premapix> 	$.galleriffic = {
[22:44:36] <coldhead> ?p @ premapix
[22:45:28] <khurram> premapix: use pastebin or jsfiddle
[22:45:35] <premapix> OK will do sorry
[22:45:40] <coldhead> what are you doing on this page, khurram!
[22:45:42] <coldhead> it's crazy!
[22:46:25] <khurram> just thought of keeping a library of use full things so before i had it in ajax calls and it was taking just a bit of time then i thought it is of my personal use only so why not just have all the db
[22:46:36] <khurram> inside the page and use javascript to display the content upon clicking ids
[22:47:27] <khurram> can u suggest any approach to make it better and robust ?
[22:47:52] <coldhead> well when i clicked Testing All i didn't see any error message
[22:48:20] <khurram> you will see the error message when you lick on the left hand menu items
[22:48:28] <khurram> lick = click sorry
[22:48:39] <coldhead> and when i viewed the source of the page and saw &quot;tag_name&quot;:&quot;testing all
[22:48:47] <coldhead> i got terrified
[22:49:08] <khurram> i am doing htmlspecialchars ( json_encode( my_blog_data ) ) ;
[22:49:14] <coldhead> why!
[22:49:20] <khurram> that is what is causing so many quotes
[22:49:20] <coldhead> i am too stupid for this i think
[22:49:31] <khurram> i agree :)
[22:50:25] <khurram> so the problem is with the quot right ?
[22:51:34] <premapix> Just trying this again -- can anyone help enlighten me on how generally this works -- doesn't look like standard jQuery
[22:51:34] <premapix> http://jsfiddle.net/premapix/y33Zb/
[22:52:09] <premapix> Don't need to know exactly how it works but why is it written like this
[22:54:01] <Cluber> How would I handle multiple buttons with different functionality, on the same page. For example I have 4 buttons all called 'Send data A', B, C and D all providing different functionality but they have the same class, <div class="ShowGallery"><button>View Gallery</button></div> I have more than 4 different galleries containing different images, how would I handle this? as each button needs a different .click() event
[22:54:30] <coldhead> khurram: i am pretty sure this is not a good way to do whatever you're doing
[22:54:45] <coldhead> there are too many places the problems could arise
[22:55:01] <khurram> i c
[22:55:07] <khurram> i know what do u suggest ?
[22:55:25] <khurram> ajax ?
[22:55:28] <coldhead> i can't even understand what you're trying to do
[22:55:37] <coldhead> maybe something with ajax() and tmpl()
[22:55:49] <khurram> ajax is slow for big posts ?
[22:55:56] <coldhead> ?tmpl
[22:56:05] <coldhead> bah bot-t
[22:56:35] <coldhead> khurram: if you use a template engine in javascript you can reduce the amount of data you need to transfer
[22:56:49] <coldhead> what you have here seems to add a lot more data
[22:57:09] <khurram> on jquery web site they say the templates are not finalized version
[22:57:11] <khurram> they are in beta
[22:57:13] <khurram> tmpl makes web site content show fast?
[22:57:28] <coldhead> no it can make the content render more slowly
[22:57:36] <coldhead> because it has to process the tmpl
[22:57:46] <coldhead> but it reduces the amount of data you need to transfer
[22:57:54] <coldhead> which is usually the slowest part
[22:57:59] <coldhead> so it should be faster over all
[22:58:06] <khurram> i am using gz_handler of php
[22:58:37] <khurram> hmmm ok i will change it anyway how did you like the idea i am keeping the libaray?
[22:58:49] <Cluber> what is the definition of an 'active' button. Why does it stay active after i have released the mouse button and move away from the button?
[23:03:36] <premapix> Hi coldhead --- really appreciate your comments ....
[23:03:42] <premapix> Just a couple of Qs
[23:04:10] <premapix> You say  "closure" is this a name space?
[23:04:23] <coldhead> yes, something like that
[23:04:40] <coldhead> ask google about javascript closures for the long answer
[23:04:47] <premapix> OK so can I reach variables outside the closure
[23:04:48] <coldhead> but that's what it's used for here
[23:04:55] <premapix> Yes will do thanks
[23:05:05] <coldhead> yes, you just can't reach into the closure from outside
[23:05:47] <coldhead> Cluber: can you show us your code?
[23:05:58] <premapix> Excellent that frees up a few braincells.  One moreQ  if I need to can I access the closure at all from outside ?
[23:06:47] <coldhead> not directly, premapix
[23:06:53] <coldhead> let me do you a quick demo
[23:07:01] <premapix> Yes please
[23:07:03] <mekwall> premapix: a closure has its own scope, so it is "closed over" its variables more or less
[23:07:37] <premapix> OK
[23:07:59] <mekwall> var foo = { foo: function(){ this.bar = "baz"; } };
[23:08:29] <premapix> Ouch.  But thanks very much -- getting it
[23:08:29] <mekwall> if you do foo.foo(); it creates foo.bar with a value of baz
[23:08:33] <mekwall> foo.bar will be inside the closure
[23:08:55] <Funhouse> Hey guys is there a quick way to format a number with commas?
[23:09:04] <Cluber> coldhead: doing example to show you now
[23:09:46] <premapix> OK getting there thanks mekwall
[23:10:12] <Cluber> coldhead:http://91.121.100.59/test.html
[23:10:23] <Cluber> do you see what i mean, when its click it stays 'active'
[23:10:24] <mekwall> premapix: another common way to create closures is to put it inside an immediatly invoked function like this: (function(foo, bar){ ... })(foo, bar);
[23:10:36] <Cluber> *clicked
[23:10:43] <coldhead> premapix: http://jsfiddle.net/sz4YC/
[23:11:09] <premapix> Mekwall: OK yes definitely starting to get it
[23:11:27] <premapix> coldhead: Taking a look -- thanks very much
[23:11:29] <mekwall> premapix: seen in most jquery plugins... (function($, undefined){ ... })(jQuery);
[23:11:55] <mekwall> premapix: since undefined can be redefined, setting it like that we make sure that undefined inside the closure is really undefined :)
[23:12:25] <mekwall> premapix: also, passing in jQuery and the aliasing it with $ makes it compatible with other libraries that have taken over it
[23:12:33] <mekwall> and the = and then*
[23:12:47] <premapix> I see -- the point is robustness in a complex environment -- like that
[23:13:32] <mekwall> whever you kill the closure, all of its vars and methods and object are killed with it
[23:13:53] <premapix> OK -- another plus
[23:13:59] <mekwall> it gives you a very fined grained control and a good tool to prevent memory leaks
[23:14:08] <mekwall> fine-d
[23:14:19] <mekwall> need my coffee, typing like coldhead :D
[23:14:50] <premapix> This is helping so much thanks both of you
[23:15:13] <premapix> coldhead -- that code is very helpful
[23:15:29] <coldhead> Cluber: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/417281/
[23:15:35] <coldhead> hey fuck you mekwall :)
[23:15:48] <mekwall> i love you too!
[23:16:41] <Cluber> coldhead: Thanks I will have a look
[23:16:42] <coldhead> premapix: you're welcome
[23:16:46] <mekwall> premapix: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[23:16:50] <mekwall> seems down for now
[23:16:55] <mekwall> but you should check it out once its up
[23:17:00] <Cluber> appreciate the example
[23:17:05] <premapix> OK have it bookmarked
[23:17:13] <premapix> coolest
[23:17:57] <mekwall> premapix: ben_alman has many good articles on his blog, so be sure to look around :)
[23:18:15] <coldhead> ben almond is a dream boat
[23:18:43] <premapix> Yes will do that got some gallery plugins to graunch so going to need this!
[23:21:11] <khurram> can i make a small utility in the admin panel of the wordpress to merge the few images ?
[23:22:05] <Cluber> coldhead: http://91.121.100.59/test.html - Am I doing something wrong?
[23:22:16] <astropirate> How can i find a namespaced XML element?   this works with firefox, but does not with chrome (12)   $(foo).find('[nodeName=\'z:row\']')
[23:36:25] <mekwall> astropirate: got a test case?
[23:37:06] <astropirate> mekwall, i figured out that isn't the issue, its an issue with the ajax call
[23:37:25] <mekwall> ok :)
[23:42:08] <coldhead> Cluber: you still struggling?
[23:42:13] <coldhead> i just had to deal with a tradesperson
[23:43:05] <Cluber> coldhead: yeah, take a look at my link
[23:43:17] <Cluber> http://91.121.100.59/test.html - when it is clicked it stays 'active'
[23:43:36] <Cluber> is this normal behaviour?
[23:44:02] <coldhead> it stays active until you close the alert()
[23:44:10] <Cluber> not for me...
[23:44:14] <coldhead> that's because alert() is a bitch
[23:44:26] <Cluber> ah right, i was only using thta to test it lol
[23:44:31] <coldhead> if you remove the alert it should only be "active" while you hover
[23:44:32] <Cluber> so it's alert that is causing that
[23:44:36] <coldhead> yes
[23:44:39] <coldhead> ?alert
[23:44:39] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[23:44:55] <coldhead> alert is too bossy
[23:45:44] <Cluber> hmm
[23:45:49] <Cluber> i removed the alert, still the same..
[23:46:26] <coldhead> lemme see that
[23:46:32] <Cluber> refresh the page
[23:47:40] <coldhead> no for me in chrome, when i hover, it is red, stripey red, while i click it is solid red and when i hover off it reverts to black
[23:48:01] <Cluber> hmm
[23:48:06] <Cluber> im using firefox 5.0
[23:48:14] <coldhead> i'll try my firefox
[23:48:32] <Cluber> yeah chrome works for me
[23:49:03] <coldhead> given that firefox 5 is about 10 minutes old, i suspect it is a bug in the browser
[23:49:16] <Cluber> what version of FF do you have?
[23:49:23] <coldhead> no, i see your weird behaviour in fx 3
[23:49:29] <coldhead> so ignore that
[23:49:31] <Cluber> hm
[23:49:55] <Cluber> could it be to do with the version of JQ i am using
[23:50:08] <Cluber> i noticed that when i downloaded my custom these, it uses an older version
[23:50:09] <coldhead> ah yes
[23:50:24] <coldhead> UI is pretty tightly coupled to particular jQ versions
[23:50:26] <Cluber> *theme
[23:50:30] <coldhead> check the UI site
[23:50:57] <Cluber> so its not just a case of going in and updating the jquery version for my theme
[23:51:11] <coldhead> no that could work
[23:51:18] <Cluber> ok, i will have a go
[23:51:23] <coldhead> you just want to use the right jQ version for your UI version
[23:53:23] <Cluber> coldhead: hmm
[23:53:58] <Cluber> coldhead: I used the themeroller and downloaded the theme
[23:54:10] <Cluber> it already came with a jQ in the /js folder
[23:54:25] <Cluber> so i was pointing to that
[23:54:29] <coldhead> that should be the best matching version
[23:54:31] <coldhead> oh
[23:54:36] <coldhead> that's the one that wasn't working?
[23:54:39] <Cluber> yes...
[23:54:41] <coldhead> DAMN YOU JQUERY UI!!
[23:55:24] <Cluber> i noticed it isn't the latest version 1.6.1 so i thought that was why it wasn't working
[23:55:57] <coldhead> i'm just checking the UI site's demo of button
[23:56:42] <Cluber> suffers same problem for me...
[23:56:59] <coldhead> the good news is it's not your fault
[23:57:01] <coldhead> ...
[23:57:10] <Cluber> the bad news is i found a bug
[23:57:15] <coldhead> yes it's broken for me too
[23:57:18] <coldhead> what a pain!
[23:57:29] <Cluber> how has this not been noticed before?
[23:57:36] <coldhead> it may well have been
[23:57:43] <coldhead> you have to check the bug tracker
[23:58:37] <Cluber> Results (1 - 100 of 777)
[23:58:39] <Cluber> i see
[23:59:11] <Cluber> thanks for help anyway
[23:59:13] <coldhead> Cluber: the quick fix is to add this to your click(): $(this).removeClass('ui-state-focus')
[23:59:58] <Cluber> coldhead: ah thanks, that worked!
