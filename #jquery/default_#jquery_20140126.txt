[03:47:53] <abailarri> Hello. 'm trying to implement a google map api script in one web, but It not works. Anyone can help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/vzM9f/4/
[04:07:01] <mi6x3m> hello, how do I get a combobox in jquery ui?
[04:07:09] <mi6x3m> I have been googling to no avail
[04:12:55] <Whirl3d> abailarri, working on it....
[04:17:04] <Whirl3d> Think it's a scope issue. You define geocoder in initialize. But then you try to call it in codeAddress...it's not defined yet in code address. Either define codeAddress in initialize or geocoder outside of both.
[04:17:56] <abailarri> Whirl3d, see the example https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple?hl=es
[04:18:04] <abailarri> is identical to my code
[04:19:37] <Whirl3d> well, if you ask me, it's poorly written.
[04:20:09] <Whirl3d> but I don't know much, really. You'd think it would have comments if it's a helpfile.
[04:22:26] <abailarri> Whirl3d, what?
[04:25:19] <lolo> Hi, Is there any way to use data() in a HTML select field ?
[04:26:12] <hmtabc> hello there! i've included jquery ui library in my code but NOT WORKING ! Checked with $().autocomplete, and found that it is not available, is this correct way to check a function? What is the way ahead?
[04:26:38] <hmtabc> i checked with if($().qutocomplete) alert(".....");
[04:29:13] <Carty> how do I get images to enlarge on over?  like this http://www.rapid-rail.com/go/rapidrail/home/adverts.xhtml
[04:43:32] <abailarri> Anyone can help me please? I'm trying to print a google map but It not works. http://jsfiddle.net/Zk4ZY/3/
[04:51:31] <OnkelTem> Hi all. Does jQuery support using namespaced attributes? I want to get rid of huge amount of HTML validation errors - unexisting attributes
[05:07:49] <Whirl3d> abailarri, try this:   http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gqyLi
[05:11:05] <Whirl3d> OnkelTem, like <a data-something='something'>?   yes. It automagically populates the $('a') objects data object so it can be accessed using the $.data() method in jquery.
[05:11:54] <daslicht> how do i submit data using $.ajax which looks like this : form[producer]:13
[05:11:57] <daslicht> i tried something like this :  var data = $.param([{"producer": "0"}]);
[05:12:00] <daslicht> but its not working
[05:15:04] <Whirl3d> daslicht, set a jsfiddle or codepen with your code
[05:15:24] <daslicht> ok
[05:18:08] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/wSPGR/
[05:18:12] <daslicht> wont do much tho
[05:18:20] <daslicht> its a simple ajax call
[05:18:41] <daslicht> but i need that data structure: form[producer]
[05:18:58] <daslicht> i dont know how to set it up
[05:19:12] <daslicht> its an array called form which has an idex of producer
[05:20:04] <Whirl3d> so url is okay, huh?
[05:20:43] <Whirl3d> an object looks like {attrbute:value}   so a producer object would be {producer:0}
[05:21:07] <Whirl3d> an array of producer objects would be [{producer:1}. {producer:2}]
[05:21:44] <daslicht> i know but how to submit it as form[producer]
[05:21:53] <daslicht> i dont get it how to send it via ajax
[05:23:15] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/wSPGR/
[05:23:18] <Whirl3d> ? .serializeArray
[05:23:43] <daslicht> one moment let me craete some better details
[05:25:03] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[05:25:49] <daslicht> that womnt work on object arrays
[05:26:59] <Whirl3d> $([{producer:1},{producer:2}]).serializeArray(); doesn't work?
[05:27:22] <daslicht> let me try
[05:28:35] <daslicht> $([{producer:1},{producer:2}]).serializeArray();
[05:28:42] <daslicht> returnsan blank array
[05:28:47] <daslicht> returns []
[05:30:11] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/wSPGR/
[05:30:12] <daslicht> see :)
[05:32:05] <krambiorix> hi, when i use my autocomplete, it shows all items... But on my window i see a vertical scroll bar.... What can be the issue?
[05:40:19] <Whirl3d> daslicht, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ejEZS/
[05:44:46] <Whirl3d> krambiorix, most likely a css error. Something where you don't have your autocomplete list holder formatted correctly? Not sure, but if you setup a fiddle we could look at it.
[05:45:18] <daslicht> ok sending to the sertber is not the issue, I am able to send something like this to teh server :
[05:45:18] <daslicht> [{"producer":"0"}]
[05:45:28] <daslicht> but that array needs to have an name :)
[05:46:06] <krambiorix> Whirl3d, okay thanks i'll look into that
[05:46:22] <Whirl3d> [{form:{producer:1}}]
[05:46:24] <Whirl3d> ?
[05:47:56] <daslicht> that wont do the trick
[05:48:10] <daslicht> since on teh server i need that outer array have a name
[05:48:34] <daslicht> the form looks like this:
[05:48:34] <daslicht>  <select id="form_producer" name="form[producer]"
[05:49:04] <daslicht> i try to just change the form element name to a simple name not an array
[05:49:16] <daslicht> that might be easier for this task
[05:49:26] <daslicht> that you very much !
[05:50:33] <Whirl3d> name="form[producer]" in html is like form.producer in js  I believe, lemme check.
[05:51:07] <xtinaus> hi
[05:51:12] <xtinaus> is tan here?
[05:51:39] <xtinaus> anyone here know about jquery?
[05:52:05] <daslicht> Whirl3d: Thanks , i try
[05:52:33] <Whirl3d> naw. 800 people in this channel all waiting for someone, anyone to know something about jquery...
[05:52:38] <Whirl3d> ?.ask
[05:52:40] <xtinaus> lol
[05:52:54] <xtinaus> well i am trying to figure out a place to start
[05:53:25] <xtinaus> it seems people are just using the jquery set and pulling from it certain things.  not actually writing their own code.
[05:53:35] <Whirl3d> If I could make bot-t come back to life, he has some great resources. BUt I think it goes like this: learn javascript first. Then jquery
[05:53:35] <xtinaus> like the version number is what I see
[05:54:01] <xtinaus> i am doing that now with code academy
[05:54:13] <Whirl3d> jquery is a framework that uses javascript to access and manipulate dom elements
[05:54:14] <xtinaus> but my questions are conteptual one regarding using jquery
[05:55:11] <sacho> so ask your questions
[05:56:22] <Whirl3d> It's like a compendium of super-optimized javascript codes designed to standardize scripting between browsers. Jquery 1.x uses the same scripts on every browser...figuring out the raw js for the browser the client is using.
[05:57:19] <Whirl3d> and sacho is a genius, so ask while you have sacho's ear!
[05:57:22] <xtinaus> i know what jqeury is
[05:57:43] <xtinaus> what I am trying to grasp is going about using it...
[05:58:18] <xtinaus> I notice that my cms uses a version of jquery like 1.10+ and that is a googleapi remote copy
[05:58:55] <xtinaus> what I am asking is that the component that was written didn't write that remote copy of jquery but they are using code inside of it...
[05:59:01] <xtinaus> am I thinking of that correctly?
[06:00:29] <Whirl3d> you understand that you load jquery in a <script> tag and then it's commands become available to your components, right? So if a specific component wants to be able to use jquery, it will include it if needed.
[06:00:43] <xtinaus> now do you install the jquery and then use that per your own tweeks?
[06:01:15] <sacho> is javascript your first programming language?
[06:01:22] <xtinaus> html css
[06:01:34] <xtinaus> which is not a programming language
[06:01:35] <xtinaus> lol
[06:06:24] <sacho> well, it's hard to explain the concept of libraries like jquery without some programming language experience
[06:10:00] <sacho> But the basic idea is, you might often need to do certain things repeatedly, which are cumbersome to write out by just using the bare features of the language itself(think of having to write a table in html with 100 rows and columns). So you write functions or modules or whatnot that have that functionality, and would be easier and faster to write down(e.g. imagine if in your editor you have a macro to create a large table).
[06:11:23] <sacho> So a library would be a collection of such functionality - they usually have a certain theme, e.g. dealing with selecting elements, and so on. JQuery is just a large collection of such functionality - since it contains many "themes" and concepts, and it includes most of the things you might need to write a web site, people call it a "framework"
[06:11:27] <Whirl3d> Its like baking: you have a mixer, a pan, some measuring cups, some ingredients and you use them to bake a cake. Jquery would be like your collection of baking tools (mixer, pan, etc.) and the ingredients and the final cake would be your html. You use jquery tools to manipulate html like you use baking tools to combine ingredients.
[06:12:37] <sacho> Specifically, jquery handles DOM navigation and manipulation, animation, event handling, ajax, deferreds/promises and some other misc stuff
[06:13:06] <sacho> and by handles I mean "offers functionality related to", apparently
[06:18:53] <xtinaus> a few interviews I have been on said flat out... why learn javascript when it is all there for you
[06:19:00] <xtinaus> just jquery is fine
[06:19:35] <xtinaus> Also, is it wrong to go and use other sites jquery sets by getting them from the dev tools of the browser?
[06:20:07] <sacho> well, obviously, because it's not "all there for you" :)
[06:20:27] <sacho> otherwise people wouldn't have written thousands of other libraries
[06:20:37] <sacho> jquery sets?
[06:21:22] <xtinaus> so through replicating examples of site I like on the web
[06:21:50] <xtinaus> I just see what their html css framework is and data points... grab the js file they are attached with and then everything works the same
[06:22:25] <Lope> $.get(url,function(data,status) {console.log(data + ' ' + status);}); I'm not getting any status when the GET fails. any ideas?
[06:22:58] <sacho> which version?
[06:23:57] <sacho> .get only handles successes
[06:24:36] <xtinaus> is that wrong to do?
[06:24:45] <sacho> you could do $.get(url).done().fail()
[06:24:59] <xtinaus> like this is one from code academy and their mega menu is inside of it... https://en.kastatic.org/genfiles/javascript/en/shared-package-614b526f3b725990b244381dfeb20631.js
[06:25:15] <sacho> xtinaus, copying other people's code? Depends on whether they've explicitly given permission or not
[06:25:28] <Lope> okay I'll use the $.ajax method thanks guys
[06:25:54] <xtinaus> well the code says this /*! jQuery v1.10.2 | (c) 2005, 2013 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[06:26:14] <xtinaus> seems ok to me
[06:26:31] <sacho> okay but why are you copying jquery?
[06:26:36] <sacho> you can just download it from the site
[06:26:49] <xtinaus> ahhhahhh so now that's my question
[06:27:31] <xtinaus> it seems as if there are parameters that are changed inside of that code
[06:27:53] <sacho> most peopld don't modify the code of the library itself
[06:30:20] <xtinaus> sorry whoops
[06:30:21] <xtinaus> https://en.kastatic.org/genfiles/javascript/en/shared-package-614b526f3b725990b244381dfeb20631.js
[06:30:26] <xtinaus> that is the file
[06:30:49] <xtinaus> how did they come up with that file
[06:32:26] <christophe_v_e> Hey, I'm looking for a way to achieve the "image look at cursor"-thing these guys are doing: http://www.basecom.de/unternehmen/team.html - but just for 1 person
[06:35:12] <xtianus> sorry I closed the browser... what did you say
[06:35:23] <xtianus> about the khan academy code
[07:01:31] <Jonta> xtinaus: They didn't
[08:01:44] <Carty> how can I have a navigation where if I click one of the links, it opens a list (using .show) some sub links, and then closes them when you click again
[08:34:36] <Carty> this chat...
[08:37:28] <grafi> this chat...
[08:37:44] <decx> you just want to toggle a class on click? why not just toggle class on click? :>

[08:55:38] <axscode> hi guys im trying to understand this in section add subscriber -> http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/subscribers/  what should be the final request url i dont understand the json request body part. can someone give links or help me please thank you very much
[08:56:05] <Woet> axscode: how is this related to jquery?
[08:56:27] <axscode> im trying to use jquery ajax sorry
[08:56:50] <axscode> woet which channel should i go?
[08:57:10] <Woet> axscode: you can't use that API with jquery or javascript..
[08:57:17] <Woet> it's a backend query
[08:57:29] <Woet> it's an API meant to be integrated in the backend *
[08:58:02] <axscode> ok i got it, but howd you explain "json request body"
[08:58:18] <Woet> you submit an API request, they respond in JSON or XML
[08:58:19] <axscode> url?body={json}
[08:58:39] <Woet> do a POST request with JSON as the body
[08:58:42] <Woet> again, from the backend, not AJAX.
[08:59:05] <axscode> yes ok from backend, as body meaning uri parameter ?body=
[09:42:42] <msafi> What does expando mean? Is it a computer science term or what does jQuery need this expando property for exactly?
[10:11:58] <grafi> where does that come from?
[10:17:30] <msafi> who? expando? From the name, I'd guess he's latino :P
[10:28:45] <shoky> msafi: usually in JS expando is used to refer to properties that are added to DOM element objects
[10:29:15] <shoky> but in general i think it refers to just "expanding" objects by adding properties to them
[10:30:35] <msafi> shoky: aha, I think your first definition applies to what I'm looking at. But I'm noticing that expando is just one property with a unique value that's used to create unique cache slots for things?
[10:30:57] <shoky> in jquery, yeah
[10:31:09] <shoky> well, in other libs too ;p
[10:31:44] <msafi> it has a very interesting name
[10:31:57] <msafi> I think they could've given it a more descriptive name in jQuery
[10:35:23] <shoky> it's the conventional name for it, so they use it
[10:35:52] <shoky> and it's sort of descriptive ;p
[10:35:53] <msafi> shoky: you said expando are custom properties on DOM elements. That's not how it's being used in jQuery
[10:36:11] <shoky> well, on DOM elements or other native objects
[10:36:44] <msafi> shoky: in jQuery expando is just a string…
[10:37:13] <shoky> yes, property names are strings
[10:38:32] <shoky> jQuery.expando is the property name that they're adding to elements
[10:40:09] <shoky> they might also be using it for another thing or two, given that it's a random key they can use
[10:46:01] <vladikoff> msafi, it's a badly documented "dynamic programming term", it's not exclusive in jQuery
[10:46:22] <vladikoff> to*
[10:56:34] <paulvd> any idea why the hover text is flickering here http://centroraccontami.org/#
[10:59:19] <MrSavage> are you able to use jquery for scripts such as on http://userscripts.org ??
[10:59:24] <MrSavage> I'm new to jquery
[11:00:51] <paulvd> MrSavage: what do you mean
[11:01:05] <paulvd> jquery is used for specific things, its not a site builder
[11:01:49] <MrSavage> i mean that on http://userscripts.org , it uses javascript for certain clientside scripts that you want to have. And I'm wondering if you can integrate jquery into it?
[11:02:15] <MrSavage> what do you requre to have in order to use jquery?
[11:02:56] <grafi> MrSavage you can use it, if its on the site you run the script on
[11:03:08] <grafi> if not you could include jquery source in the userscript
[11:03:16] <grafi> or have the userscript add jquery to the page
[11:03:19] <MrSavage> http://usersciprts.org runs in an addon on firefox, it runs javascript
[11:03:22] <grafi> it has been done
[11:03:30] <meowsus> I'm trying to carbon date this website I'm working on. Can someone tell me whenabouts jQuery v.1.4 came out?

[11:14:27] <grafi> :)
[11:14:32] <grafi> thats alright
[11:14:50] <wa5ted> grafi: wait a sec, what the fuck
[11:15:03] <grafi> dont tell me you broke it already
[11:15:05] <wa5ted> the buttons on the index page are fucked up
[11:15:15] <wa5ted> http://rohan.bhangui.com/frontend/
[11:15:29] <wa5ted> see the error and info buttons?
[11:15:56] <grafi> not the same size?
[11:15:59] <wa5ted> ya
[11:16:05] <wa5ted> mind doing a quick fix
[11:16:10] <wa5ted> im working on a design right now for a client
[11:16:24] <grafi> i will investigate
[11:16:25] <grafi> :)
[11:16:32] <wa5ted> lol
[11:16:43] <wa5ted> grafi: it probably isnt anything major
[11:16:48] <grafi> ah i think I know whats up
[11:16:49] <grafi> ^^
[11:17:00] <wa5ted> Velveeta: what up
[11:17:10] <wa5ted> how are the kid(s)?
[11:17:22] <Velveeta> nada, working on some fiddles for a presentation i have this week
[11:17:27] <wa5ted> nice nice
[11:18:07] <thepro4ever> i have a csv file that has 4 columns and 8 rows of data separated by new lines, i'm not sure how to format my data into json so I can request it with an ajax call
[11:18:27] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: that's not really a jquery question...
[11:19:02] <thepro4ever> i guess i need general web dev help
[11:19:14] <wa5ted> thepro4ever: wel if your csv is static then you can just use a converter online that will format the data into a JSON object
[11:19:18] <Velveeta> that's gonna be a question that's better suited to some back end channel
[11:19:41] <wa5ted> Velveeta: well, it is an ajax call
[11:19:54] <wa5ted> and so its kinda relevent
[11:20:08] <Velveeta> not really
[11:20:33] <Velveeta> the ajax portion of that question isn't the question.. that's like going into a #computer channel and saying "well, i'm doing it on a computer, so it's relevant"
[11:20:48] <wa5ted> grafi: oh btw i change a git file so that the master automatically syncs with the gh-pages branch when a change is committed to the master
[11:20:59] <wa5ted> Velveeta: true say
[11:21:27] <thepro4ever> ok so i made an attempt at an ajax call without using json formatted data, i had my servlet send over comma separated values and i tried separating each line with a ':', the ajax call for some reason seemed to be dropping the ':' character like it never got it
[11:22:02] <thepro4ever> but if i invoke the servlet directly i can see the colon is being sent
[11:22:16] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: can you make a working demo of it?
[11:29:28] <grafi> wa5ted how what gh-pages ?
[11:29:29] <grafi> xD
[11:30:04] <wa5ted> grafi: basically when i commit to master it will also commit to gh-pages automatically
[11:30:19] <grafi> and how did you do that
[11:35:49] <ShawnRisk> I want the logo on this page: http://www.wadevs.com/Music to shrink from 750px to 304px and move from where it is big to 100px above the next section all done with animation as you scroll down.  Code: http://pastebin.com/ESAvT1cV  Any ideas on how?
[11:35:51] <wa5ted> grafi: read this http://brettterpstra.com/2012/09/26/github-tip-easily-sync-your-master-to-github-pages/
[11:36:19] <grafi> sweet
[11:36:43] <wa5ted> ShawnRisk: you should be doing $(document).on("scroll",......
[11:36:50] <grafi> hm i fixed the problem but its not showing up in the gh-pages ._. trolls
[11:38:01] <ShawnRisk> wa5ted: okay
[11:38:18] <wa5ted> that is nto the solutin to your problem though
[11:38:46] <wa5ted> ShawnRisk: you mind if you fiddle your full problem
[11:40:33] <ShawnRisk> wa5ted: go for it
[11:40:57] <wa5ted> i mean you fiddle it
[11:40:59] <wa5ted> the full issue
[11:44:04] <ShawnRisk> wa5ted: go for it
[12:00:59] <ShawnRisk> wa5ted: still around?
[12:01:40] <ShawnRisk> wa5ted: you can see the problem ont he site I provided
[12:12:17] <ShawnRisk> I am not getting anywhere with my problem with the logo
[12:15:18] <morfin> i hope jQuery removes all data when i remove element
[12:15:50] <morfin> i mean internals
[12:25:17] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[12:25:17] <BillCriswell> .
[12:40:32] <kaaaz> Hi, anyone who has experience with the mouse wheel plugin by Brandon Aaron?
[12:41:15] <grafi> Ugh to you too BillCriswellllll
[12:41:16] <grafi> :>
[12:41:21] <BillCriswell> YEahhhhh
[12:46:16] <kaaaz> Hi, anyone who has experience with the mouse wheel plugin by Brandon Aaron?
[12:47:20] <christophe_v_e> Hey guys, I'm trying to combine http://vaneerdt.be/rotating-heads/ with http://vaneerdt.be/hovering-heads/ but it's not really working out great http://vaneerdt.be/combo-heads/
[13:18:59] <dshap> hey all - I'm calling a function defined in an iFrame's contentWindow from within a form on('submit') handler, and then returning false. problem is it seems that the return false is NOT preventing the form submission. if i remove that function call to the iFrame function then the form is properly prevented from being submitted. any ideas?
[13:22:32] <shoky> dshap: call .preventDefault() on the event argument in the submit handler. maybe the call to the iframe function is causing an error. console saying anything? paste your code somewhere
[13:24:20] <dshap> shoky: isn't "return false" supposed to handle preventDefault in jQuery?
[13:24:38] <shoky> dshap: not if there was an error before reaching that line
[13:24:43] <dshap> ah
[13:24:49] <shoky> and calling preventDefault() is better
[13:24:53] <shoky> return false does other things too
[13:24:59] <dshap> I'm checking to see if there's an error
[13:25:11] <dshap> could be that i was missing it because my console gets cleared upon navigation
[13:34:29] <dshap> shoky: that was it! thanks a lot for the tip, my bad
[14:04:22] <walidvb> hey guys, i got a problem with some jquery on iphone, that i can't debug
[14:06:04] <walidvb> i get an error saying 'undefined' is not a function
[14:06:44] <Velveeta> oh that's easy, just do this: function undefined () {}… fixed!
[14:06:49] <Velveeta> j/k
[14:07:23] <Velveeta> have you grabbed the ios emulator to be able to debug in an ios environment?
[14:10:23] <walidvb> Velveeta: no, i'm using safari to do that.
[14:10:42] <walidvb> i tried running the inststruction directly in the console
[14:11:41] <walidvb> i have jQuery
[14:11:54] <walidvb> i can run ie jQuery(window)
[14:12:16] <walidvb> it does find my slidejs fct
[14:12:27] <walidvb> but it won't run it
[14:13:20] <walidvb> it's very weird.
[14:13:42] <walidvb> site is http://next.lezoo.ch/visu/installations/not-2
[14:14:14] <walidvb> Velveeta: any clue?
[14:14:26] <walidvb> the rest of my code is running just fine
[14:29:56] <Velveeta> sorry, i was away from the keyboard for a little bit… can you reproduce the issue in safari? or is it iphone-specific?
[14:31:56] <Velveeta> well, on that page, in chrome, i'm seeing errors coming out of some angular code.. cannot read property length of undefined
[14:32:26] <walidvb> Velveeta: it's iphone related
[14:32:57] <Velveeta> so you can't reproduce it in your safari then?
[14:33:51] <walidvb> Velveeta: nope
[14:34:19] <Velveeta> then you're gonna need to download the ios emulator and hook your safari process up to debug the emulator
[14:34:47] <walidvb> Velveeta: i can run the developer console from safari with the iphone plugged, too
[14:34:55] <Hilton> I have this: var items = $('.delayremove').delay(1000).fadeOut(2000, function() { items.remove(); }); I want to change this to add 500ms to the delay for each item. I think I can do that with .each(), but I'm not sure how to write the fadeout callback function in that situation.
[14:35:14] <Velveeta> i'm also seeing an error in your code about slidejs being undefined
[14:35:39] <thepro4ever> heres a really stupid question, when viewing the source of a web page is there a way I can view the resultant html code that was generated by jquery?? for instance I have some javascript code which will manipulate the dom and add rows to an html table, i want to see the resulting generated html of the page, is that possible?
[14:35:42] <Velveeta> and when i set a breakpoint on line 70 of your custom.js, i don't see it slidejs in the $.fn namespace
[14:36:19] <walidvb> hm fair emough
[14:36:23] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: viewing a web page's source will only ever show you exactly what was pushed from the server, never anything else.. you have to view it with a dom inspector to get the live, current state of the dom, which will include anything jquery has generated
[14:36:45] <thepro4ever> Velveeta: what dom inspector do you use?
[14:36:55] <walidvb> however, the script is loaded before custom.js is run
[14:37:25] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: whichever one comes in the browser i'm testing in… everything from IE8+, FF, Chrome, Safari, all have their own built in dom inspectors
[14:38:22] <Velveeta> walidvb: in which file?
[14:38:25] <walidvb> Velveeta: what's weird, is that i sometimes get the same error at line 5
[14:38:37] <walidvb> jquery.slidejs.min.js
[14:39:06] <walidvb> Velveeta: and i'm not too familiar with iphone specific bugs :(
[14:39:07] <Velveeta> walidvb: but what path is that in? i don't want to wade through all the folders of assets behind this page :D
[14:39:23] <walidvb> Velveeta: for example, i now have TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('.no-touch .dropdown-toggle').dropdownHover()')
[14:39:31] <walidvb> Velveeta: of course, sorry.
[14:39:48] <walidvb> it's in sites/all/themes/lezoo/libs
[14:39:52] <Velveeta> that sounds like dropdownHover isn't defined in the $.fn namespace at that point either then, sounds like you may have some race conditions going on
[14:39:57] <Velveeta> ok, let me take a look
[14:40:05] <walidvb> i'll look up race condition :)
[14:40:42] <walidvb> ok
[14:40:46] <Velveeta> it means you have files being loaded asynchronously, with dependencies on other files being loaded asynchronously, and your code is executing out of order
[14:40:57] <Velveeta> so it's trying to access library extensions before they've been fully loaded
[14:41:23] <walidvb> yep
[14:41:44] <Velveeta> where are you calling for those plugins to be loaded?
[14:42:03] <walidvb> Velveeta: simply by including them
[14:42:13] <Velveeta> in script tags or what?
[14:42:14] <walidvb> custom.s is the last file included
[14:42:49] <walidvb> Velveeta: es
[14:42:50] <walidvb> yes
[14:43:35] <Velveeta> well crap, that negates the race condition idea, script tags will block the browser from continuing on until it's finished loading and executing that asset
[14:43:47] <walidvb> Velveeta: that's what i thozt
[14:43:52] <walidvb> thought*
[14:45:56] <Velveeta> oh wait, here's one problem
[14:46:01] <Velveeta> line 70's problem anyway
[14:46:21] <Velveeta> you're calling .slidejs(), but it should be .slidesjs(), you're missing an 's'
[14:46:45] <walidvb> ...oh my...
[14:47:29] <walidvb> hm i have the error with dropdownHover, let me check the name of the fct ;D
[14:47:37] <Velveeta> and at the time that whole block of code (all of custom.js) is executed, dropdownHover exists also, so i'd just make sure you didn't typo that one too :D
[14:47:41] <Velveeta> exactly ;)
[14:48:33] <Velveeta> .dropdownHover() looks correct to me though
[14:49:22] <Velveeta> hilton: i didn't miss you, re-reading your question now
[14:49:32] <walidvb> and it went thrgough that line earlier, too
[14:49:34] <Velveeta> oh wait, he's already gone, nevermine
[14:49:37] <Velveeta> nevermind*
[14:53:02] <wa5ted> grafi: you still around
[14:53:07] <wa5ted> one last thing
[14:53:26] <Velveeta> he told me that if you came looking for him, to tell you to save it.. for oprah...
[14:53:40] <Velveeta> and to put my hand up in your face like in a talk-to-the-hand gesture
[14:54:12] <netaction> Hi! I need a custom event that is independent of the DOM elements. Tried $.on() and $.trigger("EVENT"); But this does not work. What is the element the trigger should be bound to?
[14:55:18] <Velveeta> netaction: you need a custom event to trigger *not* on a dom element?
[14:55:36] <Velveeta> you can bind it to the document if you want
[14:55:53] <Velveeta> $(document).on('customeventname', function () {});
[14:56:17] <netaction> Velveeta: I need a class that reacts on events and triggers methods on other parts of the programme. I thought the triggers could be the best method to make the class independent of the rest.
[14:56:54] <Velveeta> when you say class in this context, i'm gonna assume you mean a javascript function as opposed to a css class, right?
[14:57:21] <netaction> When it has new data it should say: "Hey, I have new data!" Then the other classes can decide if they want to use it or not.
[14:57:43] <netaction> I mean pure JavaScript
[14:58:06] <Velveeta> jquery doesn't provide a generic pubsub model for event dispatching outside of the dom, which is what you're describing… you would have to bind a listener to *some* dom node to be able to use jquery's event system… i would suggest the document node itself
[14:58:46] <Velveeta> otherwise, you'll have to roll your own observer/mediator setup for event handling on non-dom objects
[14:59:25] <netaction> Thanks. Is there a better way with simple usage of objects?
[15:00:12] <netaction> myObject -> send("blah"); instead of $(document).trigger("send","blah");
[15:01:26] <Velveeta> not anything that jquery provides, but you could probably find something you could drop in as a 3rd party module to provide that sort of thing, just search for something like: javascript pub sub plugin, or: javascript observer plugin
[15:02:45] <Velveeta> actually, this looks kind of promising: https://gist.github.com/cowboy/661855
[15:03:17] <netaction> Idea: function registerHandler(eventName,handlerFunction) { handlers.push(handlerFunction); }
[15:03:36] <netaction> And then: myObject.registerHandler("EVENT",myFunction);
[15:04:03] <netaction> And when the event occurs the class calls all functions found in handlers[].
[15:04:05] <Velveeta> check the link i just posted.. it creates 3 new functions for $.subscribe, $.unsubscribe, and $.publish
[15:04:47] <netaction> Velveeta: Yeah thanks. This is the way I know from node.js.
[15:05:21] <Velveeta> oh well if you're already using node, you could always just take a node module for something like EventEmitter, and wrap it in browserify and load it in the browser
[15:05:50] <netaction> No this is broser side. I just compared to node.
[15:06:09] <Velveeta> right, but browserify allows you to take commonjs modules and wrap them for use in a browser context
[15:06:35] <netaction> Yeah this is gonna to become too big for a nice reusable class.
[15:07:44] <netaction> I event try to become jQuery independent.
[15:08:35] <Velveeta> if you want jquery independence, then you're gonna have to roll your own solution or else find a ready to go module that provides event bussing for generic js objects, like node's EventEmitter
[15:08:59] <walidvb>  i'm still having trouble  with my dropdownHover fct
[15:09:24] <walidvb> which is weird, considering it should never be called, as there is no .no-touch .dropdown on my iphone DOM
[15:12:35] <Velveeta> walidvb: it doesn't matter if there are no nodes like that on iphone, it'll still try calling that function because you're calling it explicitly, even if it's being called on an empty collection
[15:12:52] <Velveeta> are you conditionally loading dropdownHover? so that it doesn't load at all on an iphone?
[15:13:04] <walidvb> Velveeta: no, but the plugin itself might
[15:13:37] <walidvb> it seems it does
[15:13:39] <Velveeta> on line 12, you're calling it explicitly: $('.no-touch .dropdown-toggle').dropdownHover(); … there's nothing conditional about that
[15:14:00] <walidvb> Velveeta: the dropdownHover() fct might be declared conditionally
[15:14:01] <Velveeta> so you want to wrap that in a conditional check of some kind, like: if ($.fn.dropdownHover)
[15:14:10] <walidvb> thankx
[15:14:20] <walidvb> i didn't know the best syntax for that in jquery
[15:14:28] <Velveeta> or you can polyfill that function where it's missing
[15:14:36] <Velveeta> at the top of your custom.js, do something like this:
[15:14:53] <Velveeta> if (!$.fn.dropdownHover) { $.fn.dropdownHover = $.noop; }
[15:14:59] <walidvb> Velveeta: yes!
[15:15:06] <Velveeta> that just declares an empty function in its place if it doesn't exist
[15:15:09] <walidvb> thank you!
[15:15:17] <Velveeta> and then you don't have to worry about checking for it everywhere you try to use it
[15:15:22] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[15:15:24] <walidvb> i'll read about polyfill and noop
[15:15:37] <walidvb> thanks a lot, i can now go to bed :)
[15:15:38] <Velveeta> $.noop is literally just this: $.noop = function () {};
[15:15:42] <walidvb> oh
[15:15:44] <walidvb> ok
[15:15:45] <Velveeta> it's just an empty function, noop = no operation
[15:16:01] <walidvb> right
[15:16:05] <Velveeta> polyfill just means to supply missing functionality where you find it missing
[15:16:23] <Velveeta> so if there isn't a dropdownHover function declared, you declare one yourself, as an empty function
[15:16:33] <Velveeta> that way you can call it reliably without it being undefined, and it just won't do anything
[15:17:00] <walidvb> Velveeta: great
[15:17:19] <walidvb> wake up dummer than when you go to sleep, right? ;)
[15:18:02] <Velveeta> heheheh
[15:23:35] <afroradiohead> i've been trying to learn angularjs guys, and its just not doing it for me
[15:23:42] <afroradiohead> its much harder than jquery
[15:23:58] <afroradiohead> anyone else run into that same problem?
[15:24:18] <Velveeta> we have two product teams where i work that are running on angular.. i've picked up some of the terminology just from discussions, but haven't made an honest attempt at an angular app myself yet
[15:24:50] <afroradiohead> yeah? does it look useful from what you saw?
[15:25:33] <Velveeta> it definitely has its uses, and it relies heavily on dependency injection, which is great.. the thing i don't like about it though, is that it's sort of an all or nothing thing
[15:26:13] <afroradiohead> yeah i think I know what you mean
[15:26:20] <Velveeta> angular expects to be the only thing mucking with the dom so it can keep track of changes, so if you want to use say, a jquery ui widget in the page also, you have to create an angular directive wrapper for it, so that angular can rerun its digest cycle after jquery ui has made dom alterations
[15:26:50] <afroradiohead> there we go, that's what I was wondering
[15:26:55] <afroradiohead> that sounds way too complicated
[15:27:28] <Velveeta> i currently have a side project going on for a generic event bus for people that want to use mixed environments and have components communicate back and forth between them
[15:27:37] <Velveeta> because like, jquery's event system is different than angular's
[15:27:53] <Velveeta> so if you want components that can respond to each others changes, you need a translation layer, which is one thing i'm working on
[15:28:04] <afroradiohead> interesting
[15:28:49] <afroradiohead> welp, i'm sticking with jquery. It gets the job done anyway
[15:29:28] <afroradiohead> thought it would've been worth learning angular since it was meant for "web apps" but jquery has creating your own widgets, and that's all i need
[15:30:48] <Velveeta> well angular has creating your own widgets also
[15:31:11] <afroradiohead> i barely could figure out how to do that
[15:31:18] <Velveeta> and while angular was designed *for* creating larger scale web apps, that's not to say that other frameworks can't fill that need also
[15:31:27] <afroradiohead> true
[15:31:51] <Velveeta> i'm a big fan of backbone for web apps, it helps w/ the code organization around jquery, so you don't wind up with a big pile of spaghetti
[15:32:05] <Velveeta> and it helps to isolate functionality for SRP
[15:32:07] <afroradiohead> yeah i'm intersted in doing that
[15:32:37] <afroradiohead> I have a site that has one main interface, and you can drag and drop modules to the screen
[15:32:46] <afroradiohead> backbone will help me achieve that?
[15:32:49] <afroradiohead> easier?
[15:34:06] <Velveeta> well, backbone is just a means to an end, the same as angular or knockout or any other framework, that end being code organization
[15:34:52] <Velveeta> i think backbone is probably a little easier to learn than angular, but that's just a gut feeling, as i haven't actually put forth the effort to learn angular yet
[15:35:06] <Velveeta> and backbone has an extension framework itself, called marionette, that you may want to look into also
[15:35:23] <Velveeta> it handles a lot of cleanup and autoinstantiation for you
[15:35:36] <afroradiohead> cool, will do
[15:35:55] <afroradiohead> as long as I can modularize my web application, then that's cool
[15:36:26] <afroradiohead> at the moment I'm doing it by making jquery widgets, but im curious to see if there's something else that can make my job easier
[15:38:28] <afroradiohead> ahh forget it, my brain is about to explode
[15:38:34] <afroradiohead> i'll just stick with what I know
[15:38:43] <afroradiohead> thanks for the help Velveeta
[15:39:02] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[15:42:48] <netaction> Velveeta: I think I found the right way to go for my events problem. Simply register callback methods for the global events. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14358613/how-to-add-multiple-callbacks-to-a-javascript-method
[15:45:01] <Hilton> How can I assign an event to a <select>'s FIRST click (i.e. the one that opens it), not the one that selects an item?
[15:45:20] <Hilton> Probably have to use a click event and restrict it, but I have no idea what to test.
[15:45:28] <Velveeta> hilton: you can try using 'click'… or 'focus'
[15:45:37] <Velveeta> but focus will also catch if somebody tabs onto it
[15:45:53] <Velveeta> netaction: so it looks like you're going the route of rolling your own then?
[15:46:02] <Hilton> Click works but it also runs again when the user selects an item (and the event runs an ajax request which empties the box and reloads it, so that's not much good!)
[15:47:11] <thepro4ever> how do I tell jquery to perform an action on page load?
[15:48:19] <vladikoff> thepro4ever, http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[15:48:24] <netaction> Velveeta: What do you mean?
[15:48:43] <netaction> Velveeta: Yes, it is self made, but very simple.
[15:49:18] <Hilton> Velveeta: Okay, focus works better BUT .. when the new <option>s are added, they do not show up in the drop down list.
[15:51:56] <Velveeta> hilton: are the options loaded at the time of focus?
[15:52:56] <walidvb> Velveeta: thanks again, i'm really off now
[15:52:59] <walidvb> g'night all!
[15:53:20] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[15:54:14] <coldhead> bye forever walidvb
[15:54:53] <Hilton> Velveeta: the options are being loaded in the focus (or click or whatever) event.
[15:55:44] <Hilton> It works fine if you TAB in and click or press down, as the options load before the drop-down opens, but if you CLICK the drop-down opens first and does not update.
[15:55:45] <Velveeta> well you'll never have those options available at the time that select opens then, whether you did it on focus or on click, because that ajax request isn't instantaneous
[15:56:18] <Velveeta> is there a reason you have to wait until it's focused on to be able to load those options?
[15:56:32] <Hilton> Actually, hmm. Firefox updates it's dropdown.
[15:56:34] <Hilton> Chrome does not.
[15:57:24] <Hilton> and Internet Explorer won't let the drop down open.
[15:57:46] <Hilton> This method is definitely not working.
[15:58:41] <Hilton> Velveeta: I have two inputs; one text box (with Typeahead) to select a category, and the select which loads persons in that category.
[15:59:01] <Hilton> Using a change event on the former didn't seem to work.
[15:59:01] <Velveeta> well why not have it load the select options when a category is selected?
[16:00:21] <Hilton> Using a change event on the former didn't seem to work.
[16:00:30] <Velveeta> can you make a demo out of it on jsfiddle or something?
[16:00:35] <Hilton> I'll try again, maybe I made a mistake.
[16:05:51] <Hilton> Okay, that worked. Mostly. I can work with it. Now the problem is something entirely non-jQuery related... (Chrome's dropdown list won't highlight the last option - you can select it, but it doesn't hover)
[16:08:59] <Velveeta> that's weird
[16:54:05] <shoky> it's a chrome bug ^
[16:55:25] <nick1> hi, I'm new to jquery and I'm trying to toggle the CSS of a div using $('#contact_course_table_shell').css("visibility", "visible");
[16:55:25] <nick1> That's not working properly -- does anyone have any tips?
[16:56:03] <shoky> .show()
[16:56:32] <shoky> or make a jsfiddle/demo
[16:57:43] <decx> that should work, your error is somewhere else
[16:57:54] <nick1> shoky that still returns [] but does nothing - it's live on http://coursepickle.com/order if you don't mind taking a quick look
[16:59:01] <shoky> nick1 that element is not in the DOM
[16:59:11] <shoky> it's just part of some html template
[17:01:20] <nick1> hmm, sorry for my inexperience here. I thought DOM included the HTML?
[17:01:25] <shoky> no
[17:01:58] <nick1> Ahh, okay. So more specifically, how would I toggle that div to be visible?
[17:02:11] <shoky> it needs to be in the DOM first before you can do anything with it
[17:02:45] <shoky> e.g. that template needs to be compiled and made into DOM elements and inserted into the browser's live DOM
[17:03:33] <shoky> looking at the code.. it's part of a backbone view called ContactView
[17:04:44] <nick1> okay i'm going to take a closer look at this whole "DOM" thing and be back
[17:04:47] <nick1> thanks so much for the info
[17:04:56] <Velveeta> nick1: here's a quick and dirty explanation
[17:05:02] <nick1> ok
[17:05:07] <Velveeta> the DOM is comprised of all of the html that's currently rendered by the browser
[17:05:19] <shoky> nick1 you might also want to learn backbone because your website is using it :P
[17:05:31] <Velveeta> if you have a template that's meant to be compiled and injected by something like handlebars or underscore templates, that's not a part of the dom until it's been injected
[17:06:07] <nick1> that's a good point shoky haha
[17:07:15] <nick1> Hmm, it might be more relevant to point out I'm trying to mimic the method on line 248 here: view-source:http://coursepickle.com/static/js/index.js
[17:08:55] <Velveeta> well, that still won't change the fact that the element you're trying to toggle visibility on doesn't exist in the dom yet ;)
[17:10:01] <nick1> How is it toggled in that method, but I can't mimic the same call in the console? Something in the JS creates it in the DOM?
[17:10:21] <Velveeta> right
[17:10:25] <Velveeta> line 400
[17:10:50] <Velveeta> you get some json related to a previous order, and on successful retrieval of that json, you declare a new ContactView()
[17:11:17] <Velveeta> that view handles the compilation of the contact_template handlebars template, and injects it into the dom
[17:13:41] <nick1> hmmmmm
[17:15:26] <shoky> nick1:  that element appears only after you have a receipt code and put it into the "Modify Order" tab
[17:15:29] <shoky> and click Find
[17:15:46] <shoky> only then that template is compiled and injected into the DOM
[17:16:22] <[m]adman> how bad of an idea is it to use jquery to build a layout through css classes?
[17:17:17] <shoky> pretty bad, probably
[17:17:34] <nick1> err okay, perhaps I should start over.
[17:18:51] <nick1> via http://coursepickle.com/ (search for 10489) I want to add a button that (on click) would jump to the /order page and add that "class" to the (currently hidden) table
[17:20:57] <nick1> So I know for the first part to add the class I would do
[17:21:25] <nick1> createOrderView.courseTableView.add({"crn":"10489","clss":"APSC-3134","time":"T R"})
[17:21:36] <nick1> but I can't figure out how to show the table
[17:21:46] <nick1> Is there something else I need to add, or can I use an existing method?
[17:25:51] <shoky> nick1: createOrderView.toggleCourseTableVisibility(true)
[17:27:15] <nick1> wow... Okay hadn't noticed it was nested. thanks so much shoky
[17:28:00] <shoky> btw it would've worked before if you put the right ID for this table
[17:28:18] <shoky> e.g. $('#course_table_shell').css('visibility', 'visible')
[17:33:02] <nick1> Right. Thanks again for the help with this
[17:39:29] <scarlet_razor> hi....
[17:39:47] <nick1> hi
[17:40:00] <scarlet_razor> im doing ajax return, the problem is in the firebug the return is normal, but it not showing in the browser
[17:40:09] <scarlet_razor> here my script http://pastebin.com/zSf88qKh
[17:40:37] <scarlet_razor> the return html is would show after im doing another post ?
[17:40:49] <scarlet_razor> why this could possibly happen... ?
[17:40:59] <scarlet_razor> thanks for any advice bro :)
[17:50:25] <koldirg> Hey folks, does anyone know if it's possible to capture events on a mouse's 4th/5th button (forward/back)?
[17:55:37] <tandroid> Sure, just create a variable outside of the event and increment it each time
[17:58:36] <koldirg> what would intitiate that increment? The issue I'm currently having is detecting the press of the mouse's 4th/5th button at all
[17:58:51] <coldhead> koldirg: http://geekswithblogs.net/lszk/archive/2011/05/26/jquery-determining-which-mouse-button-was-pressed.aspx
[17:59:29] <BillCriswell> I wonder how fun that gets with left handed people and all that shit.
[17:59:31] <coldhead> i would be surprised if that had wide cross browser support for those fruity extra buttons
[18:00:00] <koldirg> Thanks coldhead, I had found that code - I guess 4/5 mouse buttons come under unsupported
[18:00:18] <coldhead> they MIGHT get assigned the numbers 4 and 5?
[18:00:29] <coldhead> but it may be that the OS traps those buttons and the browser never sees them
[18:00:30] <BillCriswell> koldirg: Yeah, try logginc event.which
[18:00:30] <koldirg> I did try that, wasn't the case
[18:01:39] <koldirg> I also suspect it may be the OS and not the browser that handles those
[18:01:47] <koldirg> it's not a big deal, just wondering if it was possible
[18:03:12] <thepro4ever> what is CDATA used for, some times I see it in script tags and sometimes i don't
[18:05:03] <coldhead> thepro4ever: it's a vestige of XHTML
[18:05:24] <coldhead> you don't need it anymore if you're using a modern doctype
[18:10:49] <snover> coldhead: how’s the weather
[18:11:08] <coldhead> gorgeous and sunny
[18:11:13] <coldhead> i hate it
[18:11:15] <coldhead> how is yours?
[18:11:19] <coldhead> 12 foot of snow?
[18:11:36] <snover> the high tomorrow is -24
[18:12:07] <coldhead> ooh you should have a picnic in a park
[18:12:19] <snover> the wind chill will be -36
[18:12:53] <coldhead> how do people live like that
[18:12:55] <BillCriswell> snover: Damn.
[18:13:27] <snover> you just don’t pee when you are outside
[18:13:31] <snover> or go outside
[18:13:49] <snover> or look out the window
[18:14:05] <coldhead> but i do all those things!
[18:14:07] <coldhead> every day!
[18:14:08] <snover> it’s kind of like if there was a zombie apocalypse
[18:14:15] <snover> so i consider it training for that
[18:14:23] <coldhead> you must have watched every episode of Girls a bunch of times now
[18:15:50] <snover> i don’t even know what that is
[18:16:06] <coldhead> oh uh me either >_>
[18:16:38] <snover> all i know is that it is problematic when the temperature map runs out of temperatures
[18:17:11] <coldhead> i think that's called Absolute Kelvin
[18:17:13] <coldhead> or something
[18:17:19] <coldhead> we did that but the other way
[18:17:29] <snover> yeah, so i heard
[18:17:34] <coldhead> they had to add a new pink for when the sun melts the skin right off your face
[18:17:35] <snover> if you are in hell, this must be heaven
[18:17:47] <coldhead> so don't use pink to mean absolute kelvin too
[18:17:52] <coldhead> that would be gomfusing
[18:33:33] <BillCriswell> Are the grammy's a comedy special?
[18:34:05] <Yahkob> BillCriswell:  haha
[18:36:00] <BillCriswell> I wonder if there will ever be like a programming grammys.
[18:36:12] <nick1> crunchies
[18:36:15] <nick1> or whatever that's called
[18:36:37] <coldhead> the guest list for paul irish's wedding will be something like that
[18:36:45] <coldhead> i'm calling that "the paulies"
[18:36:58] <BillCriswell> nick1: Never heard of that haha.
[18:37:24] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Haha nice.
[18:37:26] <nick1> BillCriswell http://techcrunch.com/events/7th-annual-crunchies-awards/event-home/
[18:38:51] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[18:41:35] <thepro4ever> I coded my server to send data like so to the browsers , <tr><th>dude</th></tr><tr><td>hey</td></tr> , without any table tags around the elements, i then use a dom inspector to view the page and I don't see the elements only the data, why is that?
[18:43:16] <BillCriswell> thepro4ever: Not sure I'm following right. Are you seeing it basically like plain text?
[18:43:39] <thepro4ever> pretty much
[18:43:50] <BillCriswell> thepro4ever: How are you appending the data?
[18:44:02] <thepro4ever> does the browser ignore the inner tags if its not wrapped in table tags?
[18:44:23] <thepro4ever> I'm not appending in this case, just sending it straight to the browser, i invoke the servlet directly
[18:45:22] <BillCriswell> I thought the browser would try to fix it by wrapping it up with table tags but I guess not. Does it work when you add the table tag?
[18:46:32] <thepro4ever> for instance i created a test.html page directly on my desktop instead of invoking the servlet, i open the page in firefox
[18:46:52] <thepro4ever> i use the dom inspector and it looks like all those inner tags get ignored if its not wrapped in table tags
[18:46:56] <thepro4ever> i thought it was interesting
[18:48:32] <BillCriswell> thepro4ever: Are you looking at the raw request?
[19:00:36] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: you have to tell the browser where to append it.. you can't just send it from the server to the client and expect the client to know what to do with it..
[19:00:48] <Es0teric> has anyone here used fancybox2?
[19:01:14] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I have.
[19:01:35] <Es0teric> BillCriswell, how is it supposed to work? is the anchor supposed to have the ID to trigger the fancybox?
[19:01:56] <Es0teric> also what about the img to thumbnail the image?
[19:02:42] <BillCriswell> What are you tryign to do with it
[19:03:02] <Es0teric> BillCriswell i am trying to trigger the fancybox on the image i click
[19:03:04] <Es0teric> very simple
[19:03:20] <thepro4ever> i need something that i can throw my whole webpage into and it will debug my javascript, i think i have a couple errors in it
[19:03:36] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So you have like <a href="large.jpg"><img src="medium.jpg"></a> ?
[19:04:24] <Es0teric> yes.. or <a id="proj_1" href="medium.jpg"><img src="medium.jpg"></a>
[19:04:26] <Es0teric> BillCriswell
[19:05:20] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: You could just do $('.someParentClassName a').fancybox();
[19:07:58] <dumb_dumb> any one could help me, i want to create page using tabs
[19:08:25] <dumb_dumb> since each tabs contain a lot of data I want to use twitter bootstrap tab
[19:08:43] <Es0teric> BillCriswell but the anchor would be the parent
[19:09:13] <dumb_dumb> my problem is when i click tha pagination link on the 2 tabs it`s redirect to the link
[19:09:24] <BillCriswell> It would be the parent of the image tag.
[19:09:51] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#instructions the instructions here are really clear.
[19:09:51] <Es0teric> so then $('#proj_1 a').fancybox() would work right BillCriswell ?
[19:10:05] <dumb_dumb> all i need is just stay on the same page
[19:10:14] <coldhead> dumb_dumb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7862233/twitter-bootstrap-tabs-go-to-specific-tab-on-page-reload
[19:10:19] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: No.
[19:10:20] <coldhead> you could probably just use that code
[19:10:41] <BillCriswell> Just #proj_1 would work, but there's no <a> child of #proj_1, since it's an <a>.
[19:17:49] <Richard82> hi
[19:17:58] <coldhead> hey Rich
[19:18:21] <Richard82> a locally tested script works perfectly.  /  When adding exactly the same stuff to a running joomla website,  it does not work any more
[19:18:38] <Richard82> reason:  joomla loaded other jquery sources,  and not the version I used locally
[19:18:51] <Richard82> anyhow,  the script consists of a few lines
[19:19:12] <Richard82> mouseenter / mouseleave  / fadeIn  / fadeOut
[19:19:14] <Richard82> nothing more
[19:19:20] <Richard82> who could help me?
[19:20:35] <coldhead> i don't see how those methods would differ between jquery versions
[19:20:45] <Richard82> I also don't see
[19:20:47] <Richard82> that's why I am here
[19:20:56] <coldhead> it may be that your $ var is being replaced by another library like mootools
[19:20:57] <Richard82> I do not consider myself as beeing very good in jquery
[19:21:10] <Richard82> there is no mootools around afaik
[19:21:22] <Richard82> coldhead, could I show you the file and the website?
[19:21:27] <coldhead> the simplest fix might be to use one of these strategies to get a private version of jQ just where you need it http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[19:21:29] <Richard82> or wouldn't you have the time?
[19:21:43] <coldhead> you can show me Richard82
[19:21:47] <coldhead> i can help until i get bored
[19:21:52] <Richard82> coldhead, sounds good, but not when using joomla / yootheme / widgetkit
[19:21:58] <Richard82> so much 3rd party stuff...
[19:22:11] <Richard82> coldhead, am I please allowed to send the URL in a private message?
[19:22:16] <coldhead> sure
[19:22:22] <Velveeta> or try wrapping your code in an IIFE and pass jQuery into it manually and receive it as $
[19:22:23] <Richard82> thank you very, very much
[19:22:31] <Velveeta> to make sure you have a localized, defined variable scope for the jQuery $
[19:22:40] <Velveeta> and make sure it's not being overridden by something else
[19:23:26] <Richard82> Velveeta, well,  as I said,  a ton of 3rd party modules are beeing loaded by joomla
[19:23:37] <Richard82> Velveeta, it's a bad idea to mess around too much with that
[19:23:46] <Velveeta> right, but that shouldn't matter if you're just wrapping your own code in a closure
[19:23:47] <Richard82> coldhead, you got the URL?
[19:23:55] <Velveeta> that wouldn't have any effect on any other code modules
[19:23:59] <coldhead> yes Richard82
[19:24:12] <coldhead> it looks like your $ isn't defined
[19:24:16] <Richard82> Velveeta, I will read more about it
[19:24:22] <coldhead> so you can replace all your references to $ with jQuery
[19:24:25] <coldhead> and it should work
[19:24:27] <Richard82> coldhead, may I please send you the working html file?
[19:24:32] <coldhead> or you can take Velveeta's suggestion
[19:24:38] <coldhead> there's no need for that Richard82
[19:24:42] <Richard82> ok
[19:24:48] <coldhead> i can rewrite for you with a pastebin
[19:24:49] <Richard82> do you even know what I want to achieve?
[19:24:55] <Richard82> I will pastebin it
[19:25:16] <coldhead> i understand that you want jquery to work
[19:25:18] <coldhead> and it isn't
[19:25:22] <coldhead> so i think we're on the same page
[19:26:25] <Richard82> coldhead, you got a pastebin URL
[19:26:49] <coldhead> i sure do, little buddy, i sure do
[19:26:55] <Richard82> :(
[19:26:58] <Richard82> I bother you, right?
[19:27:02] <Velveeta> just put this as the very first line of your own code: (function ($) { and this as the very last line: }(jQuery));
[19:27:07] <Velveeta> and see if that helps correct the issue
[19:27:27] <coldhead> Richard82: the code i sent you does what Velveeta is suggesting
[19:27:36] <coldhead> just change line 62 of the code you sent me
[19:27:50] <coldhead> as annotated in my comments :D
[19:28:19] <Richard82> coldhead, thank you very much for the correction,  I will test that in a moment
[19:28:23] <Richard82> I still try to understand it
[19:28:29] <Richard82> Velveeta's idea is different, right?
[19:28:37] <coldhead> only slightly different
[19:28:42] <coldhead> he is doing a general purpose solution
[19:28:47] <coldhead> i am using the "official" jquery way
[19:29:13] <Richard82> 1 moment pls
[19:29:15] <Richard82> I change that
[19:29:23] <coldhead> the idea is to take the good value of jQuery in the variable called `jQuery` and make it available to your code in a variable called `$`
[19:30:07] <Richard82> still not working
[19:30:16] <Richard82> I will try Velveeta way now
[19:30:18] <Velveeta> which, if anything else has overwritten the value of $ with its own value, won't cascade down into your code block, because you're creating a local variable instance named $ with the value of jQuery, which will take precedence there
[19:30:32] <Richard82> Velveeta, can I also send the 2 links to you?
[19:30:48] <Velveeta> sure
[19:30:54] <Richard82> thank you very much
[19:31:28] <coldhead> Richard82: the version i give you works
[19:31:32] <coldhead> you just have a syntax error
[19:31:43] <Richard82> where?
[19:31:44] <thepro4ever> any idea why my ajax call is not firing automatically when I hit my page?? http://pastebin.com/haCC2fyW
[19:31:48] <Richard82> why does it locally work then?
[19:31:50] <coldhead> line 118
[19:32:01] <coldhead> joomla is cursed would be the main problem :(
[19:32:22] <coldhead> Richard82: actually line 106
[19:32:23] <Richard82> });
[19:32:24] <Richard82> ?
[19:32:25] <coldhead> you have an extra {
[19:32:34] <Richard82> erm...
[19:32:35] <Richard82> oops
[19:32:36] <coldhead> you just need one after function ($) {
[19:32:41] <Richard82> sorry stupid me
[19:33:19] <Richard82> Yeeeeah :)))
[19:33:20] <Richard82> yeaaaah
[19:33:24] <Richard82> love you guys!!!
[19:33:32] <thepro4ever> coldhead, you talking to me?
[19:33:34] <coldhead> all credit to Velveeta
[19:33:34] <Richard82> thank you very much,  coldhead and Velveeta !
[19:33:46] <Velveeta> oh good, it's working now? :)
[19:33:49] <coldhead> thepro4ever: not that i can recall
[19:33:54] <Richard82> coldhead _and_ Velveeta,  thank you very, very much!
[19:34:00] <thepro4ever> haha i checked my code for a bracket
[19:34:05] <Velveeta> richard82: some advice for the future, do your dev work in a copy of your live site ;)
[19:34:14] <Richard82> true that :)
[19:34:16] <Velveeta> then you don't have to figure out why things aren't working in different environments
[19:34:17] <thepro4ever> any idea why my ajax call is not firing automatically when I hit my page?? http://pastebin.com/haCC2fyW
[19:34:41] <Richard82> would it be very unpolite if I would leave now?
[19:34:47] <Velveeta> nope
[19:35:03] <Richard82> are you guys on odesk or so?
[19:35:20] <Velveeta> nope
[19:35:35] <Velveeta> thepro4ever: my guess would be that something is throwing an error somewhere and stopping your document.ready code from firing
[19:35:36] <zen33> i have had issues with conflicts with mootools using the $
[19:35:47] <Richard82> ok, so thank you very much again
[19:35:48] <Richard82> bye bye :)
[19:35:51] <Richard82> and have a nice day!
[19:37:31] <thepro4ever> this is nuts
[19:37:48] <thepro4ever> in a firefox debugger under the network tab i don't see the ajax call being made
[19:38:37] <Velveeta> do you see any errors being thrown in your js console?
[19:38:56] <Velveeta> zen33: so have i
[19:39:03] <Velveeta> that library needs to run away and die
[19:39:07] <Velveeta> die in a fire, i say!
[19:41:20] <thepro4ever> Velveeta, nope i don't see an error
[19:42:04] <thepro4ever> i see two requests, one for index.html and the other for the jquery library
[19:52:44] <thepro4ever> is it possible i won't see it under the network tab because that call is doing a post?
[19:53:00] <Velveeta> i would think you should still see it there
[19:53:18] <Velveeta> try dropping a console.log statement into the first line of your document.ready function to make sure it's being called
[19:58:10] <thepro4ever> yes document ready is being entered
[19:58:14] <thepro4ever> thats pretty cool
[19:58:53] <Velveeta> how about dropping a console.log on the last line also to make sure it's getting that far
[19:59:31] <Velveeta> also, are you sure $('#sTicketTable') actually exists in the document at that point? it's not something created later on by jquery is it?
[19:59:49] <Velveeta> because if so, that would be why, because you'd be firing .load() on an empty collection, and it wouldn't do anything
[19:59:54] <thepro4ever> no you can see it down there in the body
[20:00:01] <thepro4ever> that id actually exists
[20:01:12] <Velveeta> i see 2 of them actually
[20:01:13] <thepro4ever> the console.log shows that it reaches the end of the script tag
[20:01:25] <thepro4ever> i removed one of them already
[20:01:26] <Velveeta> you do know that id attributes are supposed to be unique in the document ,right?
[20:01:29] <Velveeta> ok gotcha
[20:01:37] <thepro4ever> i removed the div
[20:01:54] <Velveeta> also, what is that 'tableType' attribute that you're passing along?
[20:02:23] <thepro4ever> just a string i with a value of the type of table to return
[20:04:04] <Velveeta> so it's supposed to be passed as tableType=sData in the url?
[20:04:49] <thepro4ever> yeah, right now the server is hardcoded to ignore it so it doesn't matter, i removed that parameter just now and is till don't see the ajax request being made
[20:05:13] <thepro4ever> i should at least see it in the network tab of the firebug console
[20:05:18] <Velveeta> ok, well when you put it back, you're doing it in the wrong way also, try restructuring that .load() call to look like this instead:
[20:05:50] <Velveeta> .load('/GetExpiryTable', { tableType: 'sData' })
[20:06:14] <Velveeta> load expects the first parameter to be a string, identifying the url to call back to, you're passing an object instead, so that's probably what's going on
[20:07:23] <thepro4ever> i'll try it
[20:11:02] <thepro4ever> hmm still no luck
[20:11:11] <Velveeta> can you post an updated pastebin?
[20:13:41] <thepro4ever> http://pastebin.com/pUQgjiL4
[20:20:19] <thepro4ever> I just had a thought that maybe the load function only works if I have a file in the same directory as the index.html, i am intending for this to be a true ajax request to the server grabbing the resource by invoking the servlet /GetExpiryTable
[20:20:55] <thepro4ever> alot of the examples out there with the load() function seem to only show it calling for a file on the filesystem
[20:39:22] <thepro4ever> fudge
[20:40:43] <Velveeta> they'll call any correct url path, if your servlet is publicly accessible at that url, then load will work fine with it
[20:40:57] <Velveeta> but you're still not passing your parameters to load properly
[20:41:08] <Velveeta> `api jquery.load @ thepro4ever
[20:41:08] <b-ot> thepro4ever: No matches.
[20:41:11] <Velveeta> damnit
[20:41:16] <Velveeta> `api load @ thepro4ever
[20:41:16] <b-ot> thepro4ever: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:41:26] <Velveeta> the first parameter should be a string, not an object
[20:41:45] <Velveeta> you're passing 1 parameter, an object, that has a url property of the url, and a 2nd object (invalidly nested, btw) of your parameters to the endpoint
[20:41:53] <Velveeta> you need to pass it exactly like i stated up above
[20:42:15] <Velveeta> .load('/GetExpiryTable', { tableType: 'sData' })
[20:43:16] <thepro4ever> i changed it already
[20:43:43] <thepro4ever> oh wait
[20:43:52] <thepro4ever> you have less brackets
[20:43:54] <thepro4ever> omg
[20:44:05] <Velveeta> the first parameter is a *string*
[20:47:34] <thepro4ever> here is my call $('#sTicketTable').load('/GetExpiryTable',{tableType: 'sdata'});
[20:47:39] <coldhead> fewer*
[20:47:55] <thepro4ever> still not working though
[20:48:23] <Velveeta> ok, that looks more correct
[20:48:57] <Velveeta> can you post an updated pastebin?
[20:49:34] <thepro4ever> my latest wall of shame, http://pastebin.com/cK5pBfH6
[20:49:41] <Velveeta> heheheh
[20:50:13] <Velveeta> yep, that looks correct, nothing in your network tab?
[20:50:48] <thepro4ever> there is only a request for index.html and the jquery library in the network tab
[20:50:58] <thepro4ever> and no logs on my server that its been hit
[20:52:33] <thepro4ever> is there something on the web i can point it at and get rid of the parameters?
[20:56:47] <Velveeta> well, you'd have to point it to another url on your own domain to keep from triggering XSS protections in the browser, unless you specified a jsonp dataType option
[21:03:10] <thepro4ever> this doesn't even show me the alert box, $( "#sTicketTable" ).load("/GetExpiryTable", function() {alert( "Load was performed" ); });
[21:04:52] <Velveeta> what happens if you go to that url yourself in the browser?
[21:05:14] <thinkxl> trying to use /href="https?://(www)?\.facebook\.com.+"\s/g and returns Unexpected '\', any help?
[21:06:27] <thepro4ever> going to this url prints the raw data to the web page, http://localhost:8080/TicketDashBoard/GetExpiryTable
[21:06:47] <Velveeta> thinkxl: where are you trying to use that?
[21:07:03] <thinkxl> new RegExp({{that}});
[21:07:22] <thinkxl> longString.match(regexp);
[21:07:38] <Velveeta> oh, you have to escape your slashes then
[21:07:57] <thinkxl> "/\." ?
[21:07:57] <Velveeta> you're using them as delimiters on your regex, so the slashes that are part of the http:// need to be escaped so it doesn't think that's the end of the regex
[21:08:01] <Velveeta> \/
[21:08:05] <Velveeta> http:\/\/
[21:08:22] <thinkxl> ooh, got it
[21:09:01] <thinkxl> simple stupid thing, thanks for the help
[21:09:48] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[21:21:19] <thepro4ever> omg not event this works and its not even an ajax request, http://pastebin.com/isZDXkC5
[21:22:10] <thepro4ever> but document ready does get called
[21:26:58] <shoky> thepro4ever: it's $(document).ready
[21:27:13] <shoky> check your browser's console
[21:28:04] <thepro4ever> i'm so stupid, fix one mistake then make another in the process
[21:28:15] <thepro4ever> thx
[21:30:22] <thepro4ever> now that the load method is corrected and the document.ready screw up is fixed i can see the ajax request being made in the console
[21:31:35] <thepro4ever> and presto i have my table data
[21:31:45] <shoky> aye, stuff tends to work when you fix it ;p
[21:32:34] <thepro4ever> i feel look a wood pecker instead of a lumber jack
[21:32:42] <thepro4ever> s/look/like
[21:33:10] <shoky> many advantages to being a woodpecker, i'm sure
[21:33:46] <shoky> but anyway now that you know to look in the console ALL THE TIME, you're a junior lumberjack
[21:33:57] <shoky> you can wear women's clothing if you so desire
[22:48:28] <Hilton> $.ajax() - how do you correctly catch a 403 or other error? I have 'error': function(jqxhr, status, error) { alert(status); alert(error); } and never get an alert when a 403 is clearly returned.
[22:58:29] <Tomashe> Hey guys , in jquerymobile. there is a way to open a popup that contain the native keyboard ... like a popup to write a msg
[23:07:25] <shoky> Hilton: that should work
[23:07:50] <Hilton> And yet, it doesn't. I've got it stuck right betwen my success and complete functions.
[23:08:04] <shoky> works for me
[23:08:12] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/4euAM/
[23:09:17] <Hilton> .fail ?
[23:09:33] <shoky> same as error
[23:09:43] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/4euAM/1/
[23:13:18] <Hilton> Hmm
[23:13:28] <Hilton> See, I injected that straight in, and also added a statusCode function
[23:13:32] <Hilton> specific for 403
[23:13:36] <Hilton> and I still get nothing
[23:13:48] <Hilton> Firebug clearly shows the ajax GET request returning 403 Forbidden
[23:14:05] <Hilton> with a response of "Login Required", exactly what the server sends
[23:14:09] <Uhkis> Hilton: http://jsfiddle.net/4euAM/3/ ?
[23:16:44] <Hilton> This is probably a mess that will get me yelled at, but here is the code in use: http://jsfiddle.net/ZGPE4/1/
[23:17:40] <Hilton> Did I put something in the wrong place?
[23:18:53] <Cork> Hilton: have you checked the browser console so the request actually happens?
[23:19:08] <Hilton> Yes, Firebug shows the request going out and 403 Forbidden Login Required coming back.
[23:19:11] <Hilton> So does Chrome.
[23:19:30] <Cork> same domain?
[23:19:34] <Hilton> But I get no alert, no modal box, no nothing.
[23:19:35] <Hilton> Yes.
[23:19:39] <Hilton> Same PC. :P
[23:19:55] <Cork> no i meant is the request going to the same domain the page is loaded from?
[23:20:05] <Hilton> Yes.
[23:20:15] <Cork> hmm
[23:20:32] <Cork> and no errors in the console?
[23:20:41] <Hilton> Console shows the 403 error. That's it.
[23:20:59] <Cork> hmm
[23:21:37] <Cork> from the description i would have guessed at the browser blocking you...
[23:21:38] <Cork> but...
[23:22:06] <Cork> can't see anything obviously wrong there no
[23:22:09] <Hilton> in Chrome (where I can copy it), I get:
[23:22:12] <Hilton> Request URL:http://10.10.10.10/kcs/works/strataajax/update?contractor-86-contractor_job_type=Electrician&contractor-86-contractor_id=&contractor-86-notes=&contractor-86-contract_expires=&_=1390807303070
[23:22:14] <Hilton> Request Method:GET
[23:22:15] <Hilton> Status Code:403 Forbidden
[23:23:01] <Hilton> with a response content of 'Login Required' which is what the server is set up to send back if the user isn't logged in.
[23:25:24] <Hilton> OR maybe I'm a victim of caching. I just made further changes (console.log jqxhr and status in the complete function) and reloaded again (and I always hit ctrl+f5 btw)...this time it worked.
[23:25:29] <Hilton> ARGH
[23:25:36] <Cork> wait
[23:25:52] <Cork> is "Status Code:403 Forbidden" from the error function?
[23:26:02] <Hilton> No.
[23:26:25] <Cork> hmm only suggestion i can give is to reduce the code to a bare minimum
[23:26:36] <Cork> and see if you get the basic error function to fire
[23:26:40] <Cork> then go from there
[23:26:51] <Hilton> It's okay, it's fixed.
[23:27:05] <Hilton> It was a caching problem despite using ctrl+f5 / shift+reload
[23:27:20] <Cork> ctrl+f5 only reloads the main html page
[23:27:27] <Cork> not the linked resources
[23:39:07] <Hilton> Well, sorry for wasting all you guys' time.
[23:39:18] <Hilton> I can't believe I made that mistake.
[23:39:54] <Hilton> Now if I can just figure out how to prevent a Bootstrap2 Typeahead input from firing two change events when the user clicks on an item in the dropdown list, I'll be stylin'.
[23:45:35] <Hilton> I don't suppose anyone here has an idea, eh? ##twitter-bootstrap is always 100% dead at this time. My problem is that if the user selects an item with the mouse, two change events are fired (one with the partially typed text, one with the selected item). Selection by keyboard (up/down+enter) does not suffer this problem. Nor, obviously, do custom inputs (no typeahead match).
