[00:00:01] <Xotix> If i bind some logic to an event, is it possible to pause it? or do i have to unbind and rebind it?
[00:01:11] <coldhead> soee: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[00:01:35] <coldhead> Xotix: you can't really pause it, per se
[00:01:53] <coldhead> you can add some code to your handler that returns early if some condition is met
[00:02:03] <coldhead> otherwise off() and on() again
[00:02:10] <coldhead> or possibly detach()
[00:02:42] <coldhead> snimavat: this isn't the best time for help with UI, if you can hang on until north america is awake again those guys can sort you out
[00:02:47] <Xotix> coldhead i'm just going to create a func which i will unbind and bind to the event. but thanks
[00:04:11] <snimavat> coldhead - yeah when US guyz are working, there would be quite more answers coming up, but I know other folks can help as well
[00:10:46] <rgr> Can someone recommend somewhere that hosts commonly used jquery extensions in the same way google does for jquery and jquery-ui in order to avoid local duplication?
[00:11:12] <coldhead> rgr: http://www.cdnjs.com/
[00:11:29] <rgr> oh super, thanks.
[00:17:03] <Xotix> can i recall an anonymouse function within itself?
[00:17:41] <Whirl3d> how would that look?
[00:18:41] <Xotix> Like an recursive function. http://pastebin.com/ExKdqvCU this :P
[00:19:07] <Whirl3d> isn't that a named function?
[00:19:16] <Whirl3d> namely, it's name is foo
[00:19:46] <Xotix> Whirl3d:  yes, but how do i do this with an anonymouse function?
[00:19:58] <Whirl3d> that's the point that I am trying to make
[00:20:48] <Xotix> so i can't?
[00:20:53] <Whirl3d> it doesn't make any sense to me.. I'm not saying for sure that it doesn't exist...because if it does, someone here will know, but without a name for the function, there's no way that I know of to reference it.
[00:21:39] <Whirl3d> function () {do something() ....this.call())    I just can't imagine how that would work.
[00:21:51] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments/callee
[00:22:22] <Xotix> Whirl3d: yeah of course it doesn't make much sense since it's called anonymouse but you never know. :)
[00:22:25] <Whirl3d> told ya so. I knew someone here would know
[00:22:31] <Whirl3d> You know now
[00:22:34] <Whirl3d> lol
[00:22:47] <Xotix> thanks
[00:22:48] <Whirl3d> I would have never thought of that coldhead, thanks for the link
[00:22:56] <coldhead> its a gross way to do it
[00:23:13] <coldhead> JS should provide `self` so you can just go self()
[00:23:17] <coldhead> but noo
[00:23:18] <xec_> it won't work in strict mode either
[00:23:28] <xec_> iirc
[00:23:38] <Xotix> i'll go with named function then.
[00:23:46] <coldhead> sensible
[00:24:43] <xec_> http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
[00:24:55] <xec_> search for the bit about arguments and caller
[00:28:40] <coldhead> strict mode is for bdsm enthusiasts
[00:31:19] <xec_> i think they actually state that fact in the specs
[00:38:47] <rgr> I'm probably being really blind or dim or a combo of the two, but while I see jquery in the google libraries for live linking, I cant quite figure out a link to the CSS (specifically Le Frog). Can someone put me on the right track please.
[00:39:19] <xec_> the jquery css?
[00:39:29] <xec_> you mean ui?
[00:40:07] <Flo0815> hey guys, short question: what's the best way to animate 2 or more elements simultaneously? setTimeout?
[00:41:14] <rgr> jquery-ui yes. sorry
[00:41:31] <xec_> rgr: maybe try https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery.ui.all.css
[00:44:30] <rgr> thats it. thanks.
[00:45:20] <Whirl3d> Here's a weird one if anyone has extra time on their hands...not a priority. I wondered if there was a better way to parse the input parameters of a tweening prototype I want to build with jQuery. Right now, it seems so builky. I would love some input if anyone would care to check it out:   http://jsfiddle.net/Bw72N/
[00:46:33] <Whirl3d> It's not the entire plugin, just the description and the first parameter parser.
[00:47:08] <rgr> I cant for the life of me manage to google a list of themes built in. I keep getting taken back to the themeroller.
[00:47:36] <Whirl3d> cant you just look in the gallery of theme roller?
[00:48:13] <rgr> yes... doh.
[00:48:34] <Whirl3d> Flo0815, can you be more specific? Are the elements the same class? doing the same animation?
[00:48:48] <rgr> oh maybe not. http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/Themeroller#The_Theme_Gallery:_Pre-Rolled_Themes
[00:49:24] <rgr> ok, yes I can. Sorry. Dense this morning.
[01:04:47] <djcoin> Hi all! I was wondering, how can I make a GET request with some data in the body of the request (as a typical post request would do) ?
[01:06:08] <Whirl3d> ?.get @djcoin
[01:06:33] <Whirl3d> drats!   http://api.jquery.com/get
[01:06:57] <djcoin> Whirl3d: the data paramter in get generate GET parameter in the url
[01:07:11] <djcoin> I don't want to have it in the url but in the request payload
[01:07:21] <djcoin> as a POST request with data would do
[01:07:41] <Whirl3d> ?.ajax @djcoin?
[01:07:58] <djcoin> Well maybe indeed, but Im trying to figure out how do to this
[01:08:05] <martisj> I am trying to add a new "comment" (html node) after the "Show all 15 comments" node in this jsfiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/Qgnxj/), but it doesn't show up correctly
[01:08:44] <Whirl3d> djcoin, I'm not that familiar with POST or GET or AJAX or I'd offer more help.
[01:08:51] <Xotix> go here http://tinyw.in/BLrgÂ and click show at newsletter 546. Now, at the left, there is some blue handler. if you hover over it, it slides out, if you go out ot if with you cursor, if goes back. Works quite okay. But if you hover enter it and leave it a lot of times very fast, it does liek a queue and slides in and out a few times. I've tried to unbind on of the 2 events if one of the 2 events trigger and rebind it on complete of animate(), but this worked ve
[01:09:35] <Whirl3d> use stop(true, false) before animate
[01:09:48] <djcoin> Whirl3d: thanks for your help however :)
[01:11:08] <martisj> how do i add a sibling to an element?
[01:11:51] <Whirl3d> martsj, you append to it's parent()
[01:12:24] <Cork> ?.before @ martisj
[01:12:26] <Whirl3d> martisj, what are you trying to do again?
[01:12:29] <Cork> ?.after @ martisj
[01:12:36] <Xotix> Whirl3d: Hmm, can't see how this should solve it. I just don't want to have that queue of animation. While animate() of mouseenter is going on,  the animate of mouseleave shouldn't be triggerable
[01:12:43] <Cork> bit-t~~
[01:13:31] <martisj> Whirl3d: add an element after the first element of an element, much like revealing comments on facebook.
[01:13:55] <Whirl3d> Xotix, you can either use .stop(true, false) to stop the queue and optionally clear it (first param) and go to the end of the animation optionally (second param) or you could include queue:false in your animation to begin with
[01:14:09] <Cork> martisj: http://api.jquery.com/after/
[01:14:17] <Cork> or http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[01:15:39] <martisj> Cork: thanks, i just found that function actually :) but when i try console.logging my jquery selector i get an empty array :(
[01:15:50] <martisj> $('#CommentPosted'+getpID+' show_more').after($(response).fadeIn('slow'));
[01:16:34] <Cork> martisj: you can't set fade before you've appended it to the dom
[01:17:17] <martisj> Cork: i see, but this still returns an empty array : console.log($('#CommentPosted'+getpID+' show_more'));
[01:17:23] <Whirl3d> Xotix, if you decide to use the queue:false parameter in your original animation call, you have to use the alternate syntax:  $("elem").animate({props:object}, {duration:sometime, ease:optionalease, queue:false, complete:callback});
[01:17:58] <Cork> martisj: you really have an element with the name show_more?
[01:18:09] <Cork> or is that a class?
[01:18:15] <martisj> Cork:  ALOOOOOOOOOOOOOL :)
[01:18:16] <martisj> thanks
[01:18:55] <martisj> what a noob mistake
[01:19:46] <martisj> Sick, that looks awesome :)
[01:19:51] <martisj> thanks Cork
[01:20:00] <Cork> np :)
[01:20:56] <martisj> the fadeIn works still though...
[01:21:01] <martisj> Cork: should it not ?
[01:21:48] <Cork> martisj: some calculations should risk getting the wrong dimentions when its calculated beofre its added to the dom
[01:22:00] <Cork> but that might be fixed in later jquery versions
[01:22:07] <martisj> aha, how would you do it?
[01:22:10] <Cork> haven't tested that since 1.3
[01:22:41] <Cork> var elm = $(data).hide(); $('selector').after(elm); elm.fadeIn('slow');
[01:23:18] <Cork> its how i've been using it for a long time, but it might have been fixed since
[01:23:57] <Whirl3d> when clearTimeout , timesout, you don't need to clear it do you?
[01:24:12] <Xotix> Whirl3d I've passed the duration like {duration : 500} but this doesn't work. I can't even see why this should work. I'm having 2 event's where i have 2 animations. If the event's get triggered the animate() will be queued, ut hving somthing like queue: would need some global var for all animations. sounds strange. I don't even see why animate() queues at all.
[01:24:19] <Cork> Whirl3d: you mean empty the variable?
[01:24:48] <rgr> is there a commonly used/neat way to load js libraries from online resources such as google if online, but locally if offline?
[01:25:00] <martisj> Cork: thanks, but it doesn't seem to mucking up over here so i'll leave it :)
[01:25:20] <Cork> martisj: ya, do so, you know what to look out for though
[01:25:39] <Whirl3d> like in setInterval, if you don't clear interval, it causes all kinds of mess. Or at least that's what I always thought.
[01:25:45] <onats> hi guys, say i have 3 input type texts, i want to get all their values and convert them into an array/ json. is this possible?
[01:26:03] <Cork> Whirl3d: ah, ya setTimeout only triggers once
[01:26:14] <Cork> so no need to clear it if its triggered
[01:26:14] <martisj> Cork: thanks again :D
[01:26:23] <Cork> martisj: np
[01:26:53] <Whirl3d> Xotix, there is the fx queue which handles animations. If you don't like to use it, add queue:false to your animation calls
[01:27:40] <Xotix> Whirl3d:  i did http://pastebin.com/qquikvTm
[01:28:49] <Whirl3d> Xotix, is that how I said to do animation? NO. YOu have to group {duration:num, queue:false} together.
[01:28:57] <Whirl3d> not the properties and queue
[01:30:35] <Whirl3d> and you know of course that all of that could be handled by CSS using hardware acceleration, no javascript and the :hover pseudoselector...right?
[01:31:49] <Xotix> Whirl3d: why should i use css?
[01:32:57] <martisj> Xotix: because some people don't have javascript enabled and it's hardware accelerated :)
[01:33:01] <Xotix> And no i don't or didn't know that i can make such an animation with css2.
[01:33:06] <martisj> Last part i didn't know, thanks Whirl3d
[01:33:27] <Cork> you can't do animations with css2
[01:33:31] <Cork> only css3
[01:34:23] <djcoin> Up ! How can I make a GET request with some data in the body of the request (as a typical post request would do) and NOT in the url ?
[01:34:34] <Xotix> I don't care if they have it enabled. We are not in the 90s. It's an must have if you use this site anyway and the internet today. and using css3 looks ike it's quite error prone, isn't it? But thanks for the hint.
[01:34:43] <Cork> djcoin: thats a post
[01:34:45] <Cork> not a get
[01:34:52] <djcoin> Cork: no
[01:34:56] <Cork> yes
[01:34:56] <djcoin> Thanks for your help
[01:37:49] <Whirl3d> I have been using transitions.js to automatically convert my animation to css3 whenever possible. It's great--no configuration--it just happens.
[01:39:32] <Xotix> Whirl3d: and it works within ie8,9, chrome, ff, opera, safari?
[01:40:40] <Whirl3d> where it can work, it works. Otherwise it sticks with jquery.
[01:42:01] <Whirl3d> So ff, chrome, safari, ios, android, and I think opera all support the majority of the transitions library. IE--is sketchy at best. I don't even have to think about it, the plugin patches the jquery effects to work with whatever browser you are using if it's possible.
[01:43:06] <Zhy> concerning animation: how would one make a simple "pulsing" button animation? e.g. on hover the opacity changes continually between 1 and 0.25
[01:45:10] <Xotix> jquery effect does have some crossbrowser problems? Or how did  you mean patch? If everything works with jquery anyway i don't see why i should add some more js to just have some css generation.
[01:45:44] <quicksilver> Xotix: CSS3 animations are faster/smoother on certain browsers and platforms.
[01:47:42] <Whirl3d> and if you don't want to use it, don't
[01:48:25] <Whirl3d> Zhy, if you are using CSS3, lookup CSS3 transitions--hover  pulse and you will get a really easy way to do it.
[01:52:12] <Zhy> thanks Whirl3d :) I'm currently trying to do it with animations, chained two animations so one calls the other on complete but I don't get the animation to stop... tried stop() on mouseleave on the animated element but that didn'T do
[01:53:24] <Xotix> Whirl3d I'll take a look at it, thanks . But first get that animation working which doesn't. $(this).animate({left: '0px'}, {duration:500, queue:false}); this should be correct, isn't it?
[01:54:17] <rgr> recommended date AND time picker? the jquery date picker one seems, somewhat limitedly, to only offer date and not time.
[01:56:14] <Whirl3d> Zhy, I would check to see if the element is hovered before starting each new animation.
[01:56:48] <Whirl3d> if ($(elem).is(":hover")  ) {doPulse();}
[01:57:58] <Zhy> Whirl3d, will do, thank you :) I'm also having a look at the CSS3 animations, gotta see what works best for me then
[01:59:10] <morteza_ipo> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[01:59:21] <Whirl3d> function doPulse() {if ($(elem).css("opacity")<1 && $(elem).is(":hover")) {elem.animate({oapcity:.35},300,doPulse);} else { if ($elem.is(":hover")) {elem.animate({opacity:1},300, doPulse});} }
[02:00:00] <morteza_ipo> Whirl3d: what is this?
[02:00:02] <Whirl3d> Actually, I am sure there's a better way...that's just the first thing that came to mind
[02:02:29] <Zhy> Well it works, that's all I wanted for the time being :) thanks again
[02:08:57] <Xotix> Whirld3d queue: false isn't exactly what i need. It does cancel a running animation if i trigger a different animation on the same element. Can i check if there is an animation running on the element?
[02:10:29] <xec_> ?animated
[02:10:30] <bot-t> :animated: Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[02:10:32] <Whirl3d> Zhy, here's a quick plugin for ya: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/frT9b/10/
[02:11:13] <Xotix> xec thanks. Maybe it would be faster/better if i just set some variable myself?
[02:12:10] <xec_> i usually avoid doing more work than i have to ;)
[02:13:02] <Whirl3d> Xotix, come on. If you are rapidly changing from mouseenter to mouseleave and you animate an element on both, your animations will queue. You don't even need to check if they are :animated. THEY ARE.
[02:13:07] <xec_> i doubt checking .is(":animated") is a noticeable performance hit
[02:14:15] <xec_> Xotix: but i don't know what you're trying to do, and Whirl3d seems to have a handle on it, so listen to him ;)
[02:14:17] <Whirl3d> Why are you opposed to using .stop() like everyone else on the planet does?
[02:15:34] <Whirl3d> He is animating an element on mouseenter and mouseleave and doesn't see why it's queuing up ....it's animation 101. Where you find out about the fx queue and you apply stop(true, false). before your animation.
[02:17:22] <Zhy> Thanks a lot for the plugin, Whirl3d, is  there an easy way to add that on mouseleave the animation has to return to the original? in this case an opacity of 1 ? Dunno what would be the condition if there's any to pass to the pulse function
[02:18:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/frT9b/14/
[02:18:23] <Whirl3d> just noticed that. LOL
[02:18:45] <Whirl3d> Still need to add stop to it. one minute
[02:19:09] <Xotix> Whirl3d did you take a look at the demo i provided at the beginning? Then you probably would know better what my problem is. They are not always animating. I can't use stop because i don't want to stop an animation. I want to finish a triggered animation and have no queue. Very simple.
[02:19:50] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/frT9b/15/
[02:20:46] <Whirl3d> But Xotix, I can't help you any more. This is a common problem with animation and the solution is simple. You refuse to use the simple solution, so frustrate yourself to death for all I care. I'm sick of arguing with you to help you with it.
[02:21:36] <Zhy> Thank you, Whirl3d, much appreciated! :)
[02:21:50] <Whirl3d> and you are talking about 1/5 of a second of animation. Nobody is gonna know if you stop it
[02:23:05] <Whirl3d> and stop has two parameters. One that eliminates the queue (which you want) and one that puts the element in it's dest. state (which you may/may not want. if ($(elem).is(:animated") {$(elem).stop(true, false).fadeOut(400);}) works perfectly
[02:24:22] <Xotix> Whirl3d:  of course i tried everything you said. fadeOut is something different.
[02:25:01] <Whirl3d> The only problem with this solution is that given a constant duration of say .5 seconds, if you are 90% of the way through the mouseout animation and you need to stop and start the mousein animation...doing it enough times like that will make it take .5 seconds to go from whatever your current opacity is to your destination (even if it's only a tiny increment);
[02:25:30] <Whirl3d> and this works with any properties
[02:25:39] <Whirl3d> *any scalar properties...
[02:26:00] <Whirl3d> I was using fadein because I didn't want to type all the shit in again
[02:30:36] <Xotix> Whirl3d I'm moving around an element, changing it's position. Not doing some blinking stuff. I've tried of course everything you said but it didn't work. Maybe because i did it wrong, maybe because it wasn't the right solution. Anyway, thanks a lot.
[02:32:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ed2GS/3/
[02:34:11] <Whirl3d> and if you are moving an element around with mouseenter and mouseleave bound to it, you are more than likely going to be triggering mouseleave when it moves out from under your pointer.
[02:34:55] <Whirl3d> Notice you can run over it 10000 times and it doesn't queue up. It's because I used stop() to clear the queue
[02:36:36] <Whirl3d> and by using stop with the second parameter false, your element stops in the middle (wherever it was when you triggered whichever event) and animates from there. If you had used true in the second parameter, it would have jumped to the end of the animation and looked jerky
[02:38:13] <martisj> bye bye jquery, thanks ;0
[02:43:40] <Zhy> Can I use a callback function on mousemove? I want a div to have lower opacity while the mouse is moving, which is working, but I'm a bit lost about how to recognize  that the mouse has stopped moving
[02:44:54] <NodeX> mouseleave ?
[02:46:36] <Xotix> Whirld3d, thanks a lot. I see my problem now. And i never wanted to make you angry, sry. Anyway, i'll take a look at the library you mentoined and ready about queueing of animations.
[02:46:39] <Whirl3d> Xotix! Just to prove a point. I did your Moving aorund animation 3 ddifferent ways..s
[02:46:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ed2GS/11/
[02:47:00] <Whirl3d> so you can see that queue:false works as well as stop
[02:47:12] <Zhy> NodeX: I'm using the mousemove on document, mouseleave wouldn't work in that case... independent from where the mouse is positioned, the opacity of one certain div is supposed to be e.g. 0.5 and on the end of the movement it's supposed to return to 1.0
[02:47:23] <Whirl3d> the onlyl one that doesn't work the way you want is the one that doesnt stop the queuing.
[02:48:34] <Xotix> Whirl3d I actually had the same thing once with queue false but this didn't work anymore, something is wrong in my code. wit h stop i got it. At the beginning i wanted to never cancel any animation but actually it makes more sense to cancel it like you did. Thanks! I need to read about it.
[02:50:08] <Whirl3d> Zhy, you have to setInterval and check for mouse position
[02:50:14] <Whirl3d> if it's changed, the mouse is moving.
[02:50:33] <Whirl3d> if it hasn't changed, the mouse has stoppped, so clear interval and you are good to go.
[02:52:24] <Zhy> Ahh okay :) thanks, gonna do that
[02:54:28] <javalover> i'm running this command $("#mycurrenttweetfeed").load("thetweets.php#afeed");  but I don't want it to load <div id = "afeed"> into the mycurrenttweetfeed
[02:54:49] <javalover> what I want it to do is replace everything inside #mycurrenttweetfeed with everything inside #afeed
[02:55:46] <javalover> so right now it's like <div id = "mycurrenttweetfeed"></div>  and then i run the command and it goes <div id = "mycurrenttweetfeed"><div id = "afeed"></div></div>
[02:56:11] <javalover> how woudl I make it so it just replaces what's inside mycurrenttweetfeed with what's inside afeed?
[02:57:10] <Whirl3d> Zhy, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GvuaA/2/
[02:57:20] <Cork> javalover: $.get('thetweets.php', function(data) { $('mtycurrenttweetfeed').html($(data).find('#afeed').children()); });
[02:58:04] <Cork> javalover: that only works if you have everything in #afreed is elements and no textnodes
[02:58:12] <javalover> cork: cool i'm trying that
[02:58:15] <Cork> if you have text nodes, you need to serialize the dom to html again
[02:58:22] <javalover> cork: i noticed you had a typo :-)
[02:58:38] <Cork> i'm sure theres plenty :)
[02:59:08] <javalover> idk why but I did try this method earlier
[02:59:12] <javalover> and it didn't work that time either
[02:59:42] <javalover> it definately gets it
[02:59:48] <Zhy> thanks again Whirl3d :) I owe you one, or rather 2 now ;D
[02:59:48] <javalover> i see in console it retrieves the div
[02:59:48] <Whirl3d> So, Zhy, I did it differntly than I said originally. I set a timeout of 1 second. If the document doesn't get a mousemove event before the timer times out, the mouse hasn't moved. By chaning the timeout interval, you can make it more/;ess sensitive
[02:59:57] <javalover> it's just not replacing the content...
[03:00:17] <javalover> hold up
[03:00:21] <Cork> javalover: ah, you notised i missed the # in the selector there right?
[03:00:22] <javalover> i noticed a missing # lets try again
[03:00:25] <javalover> hahahaha yes just now
[03:00:29] <Cork> :)
[03:01:12] <azk> hmm
[03:01:22] <azk> my site seems to not work in safari
[03:01:44] <sn0lan> azk: whats wrong with it?
[03:01:46] <Cork> yup, your site is baned by apple
[03:01:49] <Cork> ;P
[03:02:35] <azk> lol
[03:02:52] <azk> sn0lan: well it just throws an error reserved for when the db call fails
[03:02:59] <azk> really weird
[03:03:55] <javalover> idk why it's just not working
[03:04:34] <Cork> javalover: you have a live link?
[03:04:42] <javalover> nah it definately retreives the file
[03:04:44] <javalover> which is wierd
[03:04:51] <javalover> so it loads everything just not replacing it properly
[03:04:58] <Cork> the retrival is prob not the problem
[03:06:24] <Zhy> Just to not let it go unnoticed - understood, Whirl3d :) works great for what I had in mind, thanks
[03:06:37] <javalover> maybe theres a better way
[03:06:48] <Whirl3d> np
[03:06:49] <javalover> how could I just remove the extra div?
[03:07:08] <javalover> so instead of it going <div id = "afeed"> //my stuff here </div>
[03:07:26] <javalover> can't I just unwrap() all the stuff inside that div?
[03:07:27] <Cork> javalover: you can't you need to select the content of it
[03:08:29] <javalover> is there a way I could select that content
[03:08:37] <javalover> i tried document.getElementById('afeed').innerHTML
[03:08:42] <javalover> but that just made it the same...
[03:09:07] <azk> hmm
[03:09:16] <azk> seems that moving the js from the html has done the trick
[03:09:48] <Cork> javalover: the problem is its not part of the dom yet
[03:10:09] <Cork> javalover: the code i gave you before should solve it, if it doesn't replace children() with .html()
[03:10:43] <javalover> i know but like
[03:10:48] <javalover> the .load works fine just one tiny problem
[03:10:52] <javalover> it creates that extra div
[03:10:58] <Cork> no it doesn't create
[03:11:05] <Cork> it loads the selected div
[03:11:13] <javalover> oh ok can I use .load to just load the content of the div?
[03:11:17] <javalover> or are we back to square one lol
[03:11:29] <Cork> if you have an id inside #afeed you can
[03:11:41] <javalover> actually i do have an id
[03:11:46] <javalover> ohhh i get it
[03:15:31] <javalover> wowwww
[03:15:38] <javalover> idk how but it still did this
[03:15:50] <javalover> and loaded the afeed div tag still
[03:16:14] <Cork> you changed the #id in the load url?
[03:17:08] <javalover> yeah
[03:17:14] <javalover> and it still loaded the #afeed
[03:17:30] <javalover> $("#mycurrenttweetfeed").load("thetweets.php#eventinfo");
[03:18:37] <Cork> btw i think you need to have a space between php and #
[03:19:04] <javalover> if I do the space nothing happens
[03:19:49] <Cork> wonder if it can find the id
[03:21:59] <javalover> there might be another way to do this
[03:22:08] <javalover> i'm having a thought one sec
[03:22:22] <Cork> you could just send the part you want from the server
[03:22:30] <Cork> and save the bandwidth and everything :)
[03:22:40] <Cork> the id selector is just a dury hack anyway
[03:24:26] <javalover> i was right
[03:24:44] <javalover> it's loading the javascript
[03:24:50] <javalover> or php if you will
[03:25:00] <javalover> and just executing what's happening
[03:25:11] <javalover> and loading whatever is inside the php into the div regaurdless
[03:25:31] <javalover> so I just changed how the javascript works & bam
[03:25:41] <javalover> now it's as if I have a seperate javascript function
[03:25:42] <javalover> awesome
[03:26:07] <javalover> tworking now but it is kinda slow...course i have alerts on it
[03:26:11] <javalover> lets remove the alerts & try
[03:28:06] <javalover> it's fast!!!
[03:28:19] <javalover> i'm curious though cork what were you saying? how could I make it faster?
[03:28:34] <Cork> javalover: do the filter server side
[03:28:44] <Cork> you save js work, you save php work, and you save bandwidth
[03:28:53] <javalover> i don't understand though
[03:28:59] <javalover> the reason i'm doing this is to refresh the php variables
[03:29:10] <javalover> so after I post my comment, it refreshes the feed
[03:29:23] <javalover> this is the only way I found how to do this aside from the ajax call which I found to be obnoxious
[03:29:29] <Cork> javalover: instead of sending the entire page back, only send whats inside #afeed
[03:29:37] <sean`> window.location = window.location + '';
[03:29:41] <Cork> javalover: you doing ajax
[03:29:45] <sean`> I use that in all my applications
[03:29:50] <javalover> but that's what I did
[03:29:52] <javalover> i created a new page
[03:29:53] <sean`> It's a lot better than AJAX
[03:29:57] <Cork> sean`: or just window.location.reload() :)
[03:29:57] <javalover> that only has the div info for #afeed
[03:30:11] <javalover> and then I just call that page so thetweets.php
[03:30:14] <sean`> Cork, it loses it's purrpose if I do it correctly
[03:30:20] <Cork> javalover: uh.. why do you have the extra div at all?
[03:30:25] <sean`> my ajax works like this
[03:30:27] <javalover> cuz I thought I needed it
[03:30:28] <Cork> sean`: lol
[03:30:32] <javalover> i didn't realize that javascript can interact
[03:30:35] <Cork> javalover: nope
[03:30:38] <javalover> and I just removed it
[03:30:42] <javalover> and now it's working
[03:30:54] <javalover> i thought the javascript was only working for stuff on that php page
[03:31:00] <javalover> i didn't know the scope stretched everywhere
[03:31:14] <Cork> javalover: javascript knows nothing about the existance of php
[03:31:16] <javalover> so I thought I had to load into a div & then load the contents of that div over
[03:31:22] <Cork> all it sees is the html php generates
[03:31:28] <javalover> i know I just saw them as being seperate
[03:31:34] <Cork> they are
[03:31:35] <javalover> i didn't understand it's my first time
[03:31:47] <javalover> but that doens't make sense cuz what I did was this
[03:32:04] <javalover> i removed it & said "document.getElementById('mycurrenttweetfeed') or whatever I named it
[03:32:08] <javalover> and it's working like this...
[03:32:26] <Cork> so your appending everything to your dom
[03:32:32] <javalover> i guess...
[03:32:36] <Cork> grabbin parts of it and moves it to where you want it
[03:32:38] <javalover> is thi bad?
[03:32:42] <Cork> thats a wais of reasurses
[03:32:44] <Cork> yes
[03:32:49] <javalover> then what should I do instead?
[03:33:11] <Cork> javalover: have the php output the html you want
[03:33:19] <Cork> just the html you want and nothing else
[03:33:27] <javalover> but the page is already established
[03:33:36] <javalover> and i'm refreshing a certain section of the div
[03:33:37] <Cork> then do $("#mycurrenttweetfeed").load("thetweets.php')
[03:33:40] <Cork> * then do $("#mycurrenttweetfeed").load("thetweets.php")
[03:33:55] <javalover> oh i see what ur saying
[03:33:57] <javalover> but I have one problem with that
[03:34:06] <javalover> when this feed is created, it has to know the size of the text
[03:34:21] <javalover> and I use javascript to determine this
[03:34:29] <Cork> ok?
[03:34:33] <Cork> so use the callback to .load
[03:34:50] <javalover> load first & then reformat?
[03:34:59] <Cork> .load('url', function() { calculate new size });
[03:35:11] <javalover> hmmmmm
[03:35:14] <javalover> i do like that idea
[03:35:19] <Cork> javalover: no it will happen before its rendred
[03:35:20] <javalover> i'm just a bit confused
[03:35:50] <javalover> ok so lemme just type this out
[03:35:59] <javalover> I have a feed it's created via a loop
[03:36:13] <javalover> the loop goes through my sql data & creates this standard feed
[03:36:27] <javalover> at the top of the loop I calculate the size of the text which is then formatted
[03:36:50] <javalover> and ur saying do what exactly?
[03:36:55] <javalover> how do I improve on this?
[03:37:01] <Cork> top of loop?
[03:37:12] <Cork> your calculating it in php or js?
[03:37:19] <javalover> combination of both but probably just js
[03:37:25] <javalover> what I did was I combined the 2 together
[03:37:39] <javalover> so php echos back the variables from sql
[03:37:42] <Cork> if your calculating it in php, just set it in the html
[03:37:46] <javalover> and then javascript calculates the size
[03:38:03] <Cork> so your echo the dimentions from php to js and js sets it on the dom?
[03:38:17] <javalover> yes but not dimensions only the data
[03:38:25] <Cork> why?
[03:38:27] <javalover> the dimenisons are found via javascript checking the size
[03:38:31] <Cork> ah
[03:38:34] <javalover> cuz php doesn't know css
[03:38:39] <javalover> or not to my knowledge nayway
[03:38:48] <Cork> so set the data you want from php in data- attributes
[03:38:58] <Cork> grab it in your js and do the rest
[03:39:16] <Cork> and, if you want this kind of code you shouldn't use .load
[03:39:55] <javalover> ic
[03:40:01] <javalover> well for now imma go with this shitty mehtod
[03:40:06] <javalover> and then imma change it when i'm done
[03:40:17] <javalover> i always do this i prototype first then convert over
[03:40:27] <javalover> but I hear what ur saying
[03:40:30] <javalover> and how it's a resource hog
[03:40:41] <Cork> not really a resource hog
[03:40:44] <javalover> heres the good news, THIS IS WORKING!
[03:40:47] <Cork> but its a waist of resources
[03:40:51] <javalover> haha yeah
[03:40:57] <javalover> but ty so much Cork you helped me
[03:41:02] <javalover> and now it's working!!
[03:41:03] <Cork> np
[03:41:07] <javalover> Cork++
[03:41:12] <javalover> oh is that not on here?
[03:41:15] <javalover> damn
[03:41:23] <javalover> works in #javascript
[03:41:24] <Cork> the bot is dead
[03:41:28] <javalover> oh...
[03:41:30] <javalover> sigh
[03:41:39] <Cork> rip bot-t
[03:41:39] <javalover> well then old fashioned way
[03:41:59] * javalover Gives Cork $10 duke dollars to be spent in the kindness store formally known as sun.com
[03:42:48] <javalover> they have all kinds of great things & i'll never forget the greatest words ever, "it's all free" OH MAN!
[03:42:52] <javalover> what a lovely statement
[03:43:21] <javalover> ty so much COrk means a lot to me
[03:43:26] <javalover> I hope good things come your way
[03:44:31] <javalover> and now imma finally watch greys anatomy, it's only 3:43 a.m. lol

[05:40:53] <vl1234> hi hi
[05:40:56] <vl1234> gud eve
[05:41:03] <vl1234> i need ur help
[05:41:31] <dns-away> yes ?
[05:41:37] <vl1234> am create dynamic html page in that i want to invoke datepicker concept
[05:42:19] <dns-away> You should ready the datepicker docs http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[05:42:37] <dns-away> You can download ui and demos.
[05:42:54] <vl1234> its a static html boss
[05:43:13] <vl1234> am create the fields by using jquery
[05:44:06] <Whirl3d> I need some help with writing a plugin that uses a shared library between invocations. Is that possible using closures or only with global variables
[05:44:26] <vl1234> now am tryin whenevre the mouseenter the fields that time ill check that field id s ' id=date'
[05:44:51] <vl1234> then i want to call spt function to display datepicker
[05:46:45] <pachet> Whirl3d: possible using closures
[05:48:03] <pachet> (function($){var my_data = {/* your shared data is stored here*/}; $.fn.foobar = function(){ $(this).data('foobar', my_data.foobar); return this; } }(jQuery)
[05:49:03] <pachet> oops..missing a ) .... *---this; } })(jQuery)
[05:49:06] <Whirl3d> so the variables defined outside the main function are shared between items? Or only between items created when the shared items existed? In other words, if I add a definiition to a library object after some other objects (closures) were instantiated, will they still be able to address them?
[05:49:45] <Whirl3d> (function($) {var libarary={}; $.animateState=function (cm, opts) {
[05:50:00] <Xotix> if i set header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"); a cross domain post ajax request should work, right?
[05:50:18] <Whirl3d> let me make a fiddle. Sorry,. I thought it would be easier to ask. lol pachet, thanks for your help
[05:52:06] <pachet> Whirl3d: no sweat
[05:52:46] <pachet> Whirl3d: short answer is yes, those changes will be demonstrated in any context that accesses the shared variable's value
[06:02:52] <Trudko> guys i am appending option to select and I need to append it to first position how to?  I saw people doing  ("#select option").eq(2).after(...
[06:03:57] <monk12> hello all, just curious is it alright to put an id on a <link> element?
[06:04:18] <monk12> i want to switch styles via something like: $("head link#jquery_ui_theme").attr("href", "path/to/new/style.css");
[06:04:34] <termite_> Trudko, try prepend
[06:04:45] <spoonybard> can firebug stop my browser from redirecting me to another page because of a POST?
[06:04:51] <monk12> saw an example of that on stackoverlow, wasn't sure if it was completely fine in all browsers.
[06:08:24] <monk12> spoonybard. maybe if you left a breakpoint in javascript that has an onsubmit event. dunno why it would stop a straight up request.
[06:20:27] <vl1234> hi
[06:20:37] <vl1234> small clarification
[06:21:16] <vl1234> i have <input type="text" id="datepicker" > like that four fields
[06:22:53] <vl1234> here am facing problem s whenevr chick the textfield that time am getting the calander but the value is store into the first field only
[06:23:00] <vl1234> not for current field
[06:23:31] <pachet> can you post the callback function that you have bound to click?
[06:23:37] <pachet> *paste
[06:23:41] <thiessenp> Can anyone point me to a great PDF or offline reference that is not as dense as the ECMAScript document ion? I often use the MDC JS reference but it would be nice to have an offline ref as well.
[06:24:54] <vl1234> @pachet am not get
[06:25:21] <vpv4oo> silly question: why does certain script content work when i include the script in the <head>, but not when included within the ajax-loaded file?
[06:25:23] <D4> How can I find out if I'm hovering a ul > li which is the first li in the ul and do something specific if that's what I'm hovering, else don't ?
[06:26:03] <D4> .is('li:first') ?
[06:27:24] <vpv4oo> D4: you could probably always give the first li and id... but i asume thats not what youre looking for
[06:27:54] <D4> vpv4oo » No not really.. I need to change an image of the actual <ul> if I'm hovering the first <li>
[06:28:20] <D4> if I'm at any other item OR if the li has class details, don't change the image..
[06:31:02] <Flo0815> hey, i have a div filled with text. i need to set the div's height to 0px, then after a time i want to resize the div's height to it's original height. how can i get this original height?
[06:32:20] <termite> Flo0815: height= auto perhaps
[06:32:25] <vpv4oo> D4: cant you <li id="first"> and js $(document).ready(function(){  $('#first').bind({ mouseover: function() change_bg_src(); etc ?
[06:33:03] <Gozzy> Flo0815 you could save the height to the data attr of the div
[06:33:04] <termite> Flo0815: unless you have a set height
[06:33:04] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: just because a div is 0px height, doens't necessarily mean that you can no longer see what is inside of it
[06:33:31] <Gozzy> > before you set it to 0
[06:33:33] <pachet> $('ul li:first').on('mouseover.mynamespace', function(){if ( $(this).attr('class') == '' ) return; /*do stuff here*/});
[06:33:37] <pachet> D4^
[06:33:37] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: with a overflow= hidden ?
[06:33:47] <pachet> er, i misread you
[06:33:54] <pachet> attr('class') != ''
[06:33:55] <Flo0815> Gozzy: that would be my guess too, i just thought that there's is a better way
[06:34:06] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: no, with overflow hidden and it won't display anything
[06:34:18] <codecowboy> I'm getting SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.  jquery-1.7.1.min.js, line 3 character 31871 in IE8 with this code - https://gist.github.com/2509227
[06:34:34] <codecowboy> It seems to be append that is causing it. jquery v is 1.7.1
[06:35:27] <D4> Not really, no. How do I check if the current selector DOESN'T have a certain class? e.g. !$(this).hasClass('myClass') ...?
[06:37:05] <Gozzy> Flo0815 if the reason your setting the height to 0 is hiding it you can just do .display = 'none' | .display = 'block'; and you do not need to touch the height..
[06:38:17] <termite> codecowboy:$(searchBox).append(inputField);
[06:38:39] <Gozzy> erm .show() and .hide() in jquery
[06:41:01] <pachet> D4: that's right
[06:47:13] <codecowboy> thanks - I also forgot to add a shim for lt IE9 and was adding to the <header> area. d'oh
[06:47:26] <codecowboy> termite:  ^^
[06:48:41] <termite> codecowboy: happens to the best of us
[07:05:34] <sviatovigt> hi
[07:05:54] <sviatovigt> I found a preloader on the internet but I don't realy know how to use id
[07:06:03] <Teduardo> I'm using this to control the display of a div http://jsfiddle.net/RpNZz/, when ptype changes, for like a split second there is a transition of the DIV changing that makes it look like the DIV is moving outside of the body, then it goes back to normal. it appears this only happens in firefox does anyone know how to fix this?
[07:06:15] <sviatovigt> more precicesly, I don't know how to stop it
[07:06:20] <codecowboy> termite, now getting SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'offsetTop': object is null or undefined  all.js, line 35 character 3785 - from facebook js sdk. Any ideas?\
[07:06:23] <sviatovigt> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[07:09:15] <termite> codecowboy: That error means that selector returned null or you passed it an invalid element
[07:10:42] <pjammer> woah, here is where the party's at.
[07:10:46] <pjammer> pop pop.
[07:11:46] <pjammer> there are 8 people in jqueryui, and i have a question about json spelunking in jquery ui autocomplete.
[07:12:14] <pjammer> in jquery, shouldn't ul.item[0] find the first item?
[07:12:22] <pjammer> or ul.item.first
[07:12:29] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[07:12:45] <aaronmcadam> $( 'ul' ).find( 'li' ).first()
[07:13:27] <pjammer> I've got a json string and all the examples i see, are standard in the sense that you can use ul.item.somenamehere but what if you don't know somenamehere
[07:13:45] <aaronmcadam> you use []
[07:13:53] <pjammer> starting at 0 right?
[07:13:55] <aaronmcadam> ul.item[somename]
[07:14:04] <phobia> Hi :) I notice that calling a method on an object that does not exists, does not create an error, e.g. $('.does-not-exist').width(); so, does that mean that it's safe to just skip checks like this for some situations if(someElement.length) {}  ?
[07:14:06] <pjammer> i don't know somename.
[07:14:10] <sviatovigt> what does this line do: $.fn.spin = function(opts, color) ?
[07:14:11] <pjammer> that's my issue
[07:14:15] <aaronmcadam> somename would be a variable there
[07:14:34] <aaronmcadam> phobia: selectors fail silently yeah
[07:15:21] <aaronmcadam> sometimes you do need to check whether a set exists, but it won't throw an exception if the element doesn't exist
[07:15:35] <pachet> methods arent obligated to
[07:15:47] <pachet> jquery methods do, but with plugins there's no guarantee
[07:16:23] <polygon-pusher> I have a animation that fires with onready but it lags a little bit, http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/ any ideas how I could make the animation run smoother?
[07:16:54] <codecowboy> termite thanks. its coming from  the facebook js sdk so not sure what to do about it
[07:16:57] <phobia> ok :) so I can save a few bytes there then? as long as its not plugins, and not chained
[07:17:19] <aaronmcadam> I wouldn't generalise like that
[07:18:25] <Jon47> i think any file size gain is really negligible
[07:18:53] <Jon47> you should probably just do what reads the best to you
[07:18:55] <aaronmcadam> uglify will optimise it anyway
[07:19:21] <sviatovigt> can someone please take a look on this and give me an ideea of how could I start it and stop it using jquery: http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/ ?
[07:19:40] <termite> codecowboy, my best guess is that the sdk expects an element on the page that doesn't exist.  Make sure you are following the Facebook instructions and all the elements it needs are on the page
[07:19:48] <Jon47> in my mind most jquery methods implicitly do a an iteration for every element in the set, so if there are zero elements, it will do zero functions
[07:20:07] <aaronmcadam> Jon47: that's right
[07:22:55] <phobia> I see. thanks for the info! And good points on readability and minifying, Jon47  :)
[07:28:22] <Whirl3d> can you reference the arguments object sequentially? like the second argument referenced by arguments[1], for example?
[07:30:00] <pentarex> hey guys I am making ajax request and safari returns me status code -1001 ??? can anyone give me advice
[07:33:24] <pachet> Whirl3d: yes
[07:33:39] <Whirl3d> thank you.
[07:38:56] <Xotix> i have a var containing some html and i want to change the src paths. How do i do that? Atm i got http://pastebin.com/dVz4dkPv but this just returns me the img's but i need the whole html.
[07:40:20] <chilversc_> Xotix: why not split the assignment and the modification on to separate lines?
[07:40:48] <chilversc_> Xotix: eg, var html = $(importData.html); $("img", html).each(function() ...
[07:40:50] <polygon-pusher> Need a little help with a bind("mouseenter" that wont fire
[07:41:05] <polygon-pusher> http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/ look in scripts.js on line 70
[07:41:32] <Xotix> chilversc: can't see how this should solve my problem. then i just have twice the same each
[07:42:06] <Xotix> what's $("img", html)?
[07:42:06] <polygon-pusher> I know the selector works because I use it the live about to animate that same ID
[07:42:21] <polygon-pusher> line*
[07:42:41] <sublimenal> is this the correct way to use the localization when developing a plugin? echo '<p style="color:green">'._e("Updated Settings!","sp-cdm").'</p>';
[07:44:22] <xec_> sublimenal: looks like a php question
[07:44:32] <Jon47> for wordpress even
[07:44:50] <Whirl3d> It's so strange in here. I have been in here nearly every day for months and it seems like questions come in waves based on topic. Like yesterday, there were a ton of ajax quesitons, but this morning there have been a ton of mouseenter/mouseleave questions (which we haven't had a flood of in a while it seems). Or am I just trippin?
[07:44:58] <sublimenal> its a wordpress questions using the WP localization
[07:45:54] <xec_> sublimenal: so, youre in the wrong channel, then
[07:46:05] <sublimenal> lol doh
[07:46:12] <sublimenal> thought i joined #wordpress
[07:46:15] <sublimenal> lmao sorry
[07:46:17] <xec_> :)
[07:47:25] <xec_> Xotix: it's a selector looking for images within the html var (whatever that is?)
[07:47:58] <xec_> Xotix: the second argument is "context"
[07:48:40] <Xotix> xec_ var html = html data.  I need to change all src paths within that html and get the whole html. But i just get the img, which is quite logically since it just selects them. So how can i change the img's src and return the whole html?
[07:48:50] <Xotix> sec_ thanks
[07:49:00] <Xotix> *xec_
[07:50:10] <polygon-pusher> how would I call a function when a #'s display is set to hidden or visible?  So basically some kind of event watcher that monitors the display value.
[07:52:05] <Poetro> polygon-pusher: how do they get hidden / visible?
[07:52:34] <polygon-pusher> @media
[07:52:55] <polygon-pusher> media query
[07:54:04] <polygon-pusher> basically I want a animation only to happen for desktops but hide on mobile.  Also I want to re start  when the width gos over 960
[07:55:24] <polygon-pusher> so I have a @media that sets that animation div to display none on mobile but when the width is big enough I reshow it via display block. I have logic right now that prevents the animation but I need to check as see when that value gets updated to restart the animation
[07:56:53] <polygon-pusher> you can see what I mean here http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/
[07:57:46] <Xotix> Isn't there a function which does this? I'm not abel to change the images' src without loosing the other html.
[07:58:02] <Poetro> polygon-pusher: : maybe add an event handler to the window's resize
[07:58:11] <Poetro> polygon-pusher: then u can check
[07:58:22] <polygon-pusher> thanks
[07:58:48] <polygon-pusher> but wont that cause it to fire all the time when the browser gets resized vs only once if that value changes on that ID?
[07:59:12] <Poetro> polygon-pusher: maybe add a timeout to only check after like 100ms after the resize
[07:59:30] <polygon-pusher> so is there no even listener for css value?
[07:59:39] <Poetro> i dont think so
[07:59:55] <polygon-pusher> bummer
[08:00:05] <polygon-pusher> maybe 1.8 :)
[08:00:08] <Poetro> polygon-pusher: as there isnt even one for JavaScript value changes
[08:00:30] <Poetro> so why would u expect it for a totally out of JS thing
[08:00:50] <polygon-pusher> I thought maybe the dom fired one
[08:00:59] <polygon-pusher> was just a quesss
[08:01:27] <xec_> Xotix: you could use a temporary dom container
[08:02:31] <xec_> Xotix: something like $('<div>').html(html).find('img').attr('src', 'whatever').end().html()  :D
[08:03:24] <xec_> unicorns will dance and treasures will rain from the skies
[08:03:45] <Xotix> xec_ thanks!

[08:09:35] <Kaseano> hi, I was wondering, is it better to attach events to $elements before or after they're attached/rendered on the dom?
[08:09:52] <Kaseano> well to clarify, is there a performance boost if I attach the event before I render it?
[08:12:08] <Poetro> Kaseano: not really
[08:12:25] <Poetro> Kaseano: chose whichever makes more sense to you
[08:13:35] <Kaseano> oh ok thanks Poetro
[08:16:55] <monk12> hmmm, does 'propertychange' event work when added via jquery 'on' method?, i have a regular $('#blah').bind('input propertychange',...) which works, but $('#page_wrapper').bind('input propertychange','#blah',..). (using input for regular browser, propertychange for IE/7)
[08:17:24] <davidcoallier> Hey all, anyone knows a good graph library (not charts) for building directed graphs where I could potentially click on the vertices (A link) and maybe even some tooltip to appear on top of the vertices? The edges have to be directed.
[08:17:31] <monk12> ^whoops last thing should be $('#page_wrapper').on...
[08:17:49] <Xotix> davidcoallier: rapael
[08:17:51] <davidcoallier> Just trying to find out whether or not someone knows a library that uses jquery or something similar
[08:18:19] <Xotix> davidcoallier: at least, it's worth taking a look at it, don't know if it fits
[08:18:21] <davidcoallier> Xotix, let me check there was something strange with raphatel
[08:18:23] <monk12> David maybe look at the demos on http://thejit.org/ they have some cool graphs. Raphael, is that just svg, is the charting plugin out for that.
[08:18:32] <davidcoallier> Yeah I played with it and springy as well as protovis
[08:18:43] <davidcoallier> ok thanks Xotix and monk12
[08:19:20] <EdwardIII> hey heroes, i'm being daft here. for some reason action is only happening on the 3rd element in the each: https://gist.github.com/2510093
[08:19:25] <EdwardIII> #picker-3
[08:20:16] <vpv4oo> im trying to integrate an OVI map. it works when i include the api in the <head>, but when i $.getScript("api...", function() { var map = new ovi.mapsapi... } it will execute this code, but can not find the map functions from the api
[08:20:33] <vpv4oo> http://api.maps.ovi.com/devguide/getting_started.html
[08:21:00] <vpv4oo> the success part of getScript is executed, tested via console.log. but its acting as if the script wasnt there
[08:22:14] <sekretskwerl> what is a reasoning of getting <element> has no method 'apply'
[08:22:36] <sekretskwerl> example: Uncaught TypeError: Object form#search select has no method 'apply'
[08:22:37] <Xotix> is there a function to replace the content of an array like with string.replace? any index which may contain the searched string.
[08:23:00] <vpv4oo> the $.getScript happens bound to a click: function, befoer the getScript im .load('map.php') into my content <div>
[08:23:17] <sekretskwerl> Xotix: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5915789/replace-item-in-array-with-jquery
[08:23:24] <EdwardIII> hrm weird, i make a simplified example and don't have the same problem: http://jsfiddle.net/v2T9Z/
[08:23:24] <sekretskwerl> Xotix: use indexOf according to your situation
[08:24:22] <EdwardIII> ArrrrRRRgggh i thought getting a colour picker to work would be the most simple thing possible heh
[08:24:30] <EdwardIII> ok, not the most simple, but a pretty common task
[08:24:46] <Xotix> sekretskwerl: indexOf works with arrays?
[08:25:30] <sekretskwerl> Xotix: arrays have indexes
[08:25:35] <pilchy> hi all you clever people
[08:25:53] <Xotix> sekretskwerl:  of course but google said it's a string method anyway thanks i'll try that
[08:26:03] <pilchy> im struggling with a very basic task which is and if and else statement on an ecommerce product page
[08:26:17] <sekretskwerl> Xotix: if you look through the replies on the link I sent you, it should be clear.
[08:26:28] <pilchy> im trying to implement HotUKDeals script.
[08:27:02] <Xotix> sekretskwerl:  i'll thanks you!
[08:27:07] <pilchy> http://jsfiddle.net/L35pA/1/ could someone look at that
[08:27:37] <sekretskwerl> someone -- what reasons are there for getting <element> has no method 'apply' when trying methods to an element via 'live'
[08:28:47] <EdwardIII> pilchy: looks like nothing ever gets inserted into the DOM?
[08:29:39] <EdwardIII> pilchy: looks like it's also trying to find an object with the class NowPrice too
[08:29:55] <sandbags> if i have a on( 'click', ... ) handler attached a <div> and another to a span within the div and I don't want the div handler to be invoked when clicking on the span (which it seems to be) what's the answer? It doesn't seem to be event.preventDefault(); which was my first thought
[08:30:38] <vpv4oo> is there an equivalent to <script src="foo.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"> with $.getScript that lets me set the charset to utf-8 ?
[08:30:49] <sekretskwerl> sandbags: stopPropagation, perhaps
[08:31:08] <sandbags> sekretskwerl: thank you, that seems like a good lead
[08:32:08] <sandbags> sekretskwerl: bingo, thank you so much ... i'm an occasional javascript/jquery programmer (as I'm sure I don't need to tell you :))
[08:32:33] <sekretskwerl> sandbags: me too. no worries. i'm just better at some things than others. right now i'm working on something and getting an error and not finding any help in here :P
[08:32:43] <sekretskwerl> i could always ask another dev here in my workplace, so i believe i will.
[08:33:05] <sandbags> often having to explain the problem is a good first step in solving it :)
[08:33:11] <pilchy> Hi EdwardIII sorry was afk
[08:33:27] <Whirl3d> I have a series of <img> elements inside of anchor elements that flow in-line with text. I want to position the images directly above the <a> elements. What magic combination of BS CSS do I need to make that happen so I can animate them in on mouseenter
[08:33:29] <pilchy> bear with me
[08:35:03] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: that's a #css question
[08:36:13] <Carlitta87> im trying to append a line of code thru jquery to an input field but it doesnt seem to be working... ive broken it down in jsfiddle n tested it, it worked but my version doesnt work. can u see if im doing sumn wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/4n8cg/
[08:36:32] <james13433> After 2 days of struggling, ditched prototype and here we go query from scratch :)
[08:36:40] <pilchy> EdwardIII - http://jsfiddle.net/L35pA/2/
[08:37:28] <EdwardIII> pilchy: looks like you're missing some html
[08:37:55] <pilchy> see pm :)
[08:39:35] <Whirl3d> Yeah. jonkpaul, ever asked a qustion in #css. LOL I was hoping to sneak one in since I figured someone would know in order to use .animate on the element.
[08:40:29] <pilchy> EdwardIII - any luck?
[08:42:15] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: animate allows you to animate many different properties
[08:42:27] <johnkpaul> it depends on what you mean by "animate them in"
[08:44:02] <pedro370> hello all. I need to make a request to a php script, sending along some data(4 or 5 strings). The script will then generate a json string and deliver it to the page. What would be the best way for doing this?
[08:46:32] <johnkpaul> pedro370: jquery's ajax function
[08:46:34] <johnkpaul> ?ajax @pedro370
[08:46:35] <bot-t> pedro370, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:46:38] <pedro370> im using $.get to obtain the response, since i've read that $.getJson has some security issues
[08:47:05] <johnkpaul> so pedro370, what is the problem that you're having?
[08:47:07] <johnkpaul> ?demo @pedro370
[08:47:07] <bsqtmp> p> hello! I have in my javascript this row ... and sometimes if in the database are charakters like + or : script goes broken ... any idea how to escape the string?
[08:47:07] <bot-t> pedro370, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:47:07] <bsqtmp>  <bsqtmp> document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = "<?php $cont = Message::model()->findByPk(21); echo $cont->content;?>";
[08:47:40] <johnkpaul> bsqtmp: php has a xmlencode function I believe
[08:48:39] <johnkpaul> also, when you crosspost from ##javascript, be a little smarter about your copying and pasting
[08:49:56] <int_64> Hi...I am using the wrap() function and it seems to exectue any javascript withing the DIV selected twice
[08:50:03] <int_64> is there a way to avoid that without moving the code?
[08:52:14] <pedro370> Well there's no problem, i'm only looking for what would be the best approach. what do you recommend?
[08:52:29] <johnkpaul> you said you were already using $.get, no?
[08:52:33] <johnkpaul> that's a fine approach
[08:52:41] <pedro370> yes
[08:53:13] <johnkpaul> int_64: remove the script element first
[08:53:13] <pedro370> between this and $.ajax no relevant issues?
[08:53:34] <johnkpaul> pedro370: $.get is a wrapper around $.ajax, if you don't need more functionality, there's no reason to change anything
[08:55:27] <pedro370> ok, thanks for the help john. really apreciate it
[08:55:50] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:00:56] <Carlitta87> sry, i just had it in the wrong area :)
[09:05:25] <vpv4oo> why is this not working :( http://jsfiddle.net/HJ6gc/1/
[09:06:04] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I apologize if I didn't make myself clearer. I was tryig not to get wrapped up in the implementation of my "animating in' and animating out sequences. To answer your question, i have some .png images that are photos of birds and things from Kenya. When the user touches a link, the bird appears to lift up off the page (anchored by it's bottom edge) just above the link. I've got the
[09:06:04] <Whirl3d> animation handled, now for the correct positioning.
[09:06:33] <NoiseEee> positioning = css
[09:07:05] <Whirl3d> animation=css too NoiseEee, lol.
[09:07:36] <Whirl3d> But I will figure it out. I just thought someone might have a quick answer. Didn't mean to waste anyone's time with a CSS question. LOL
[09:08:54] <nvalmo> Im getting "not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin" in some $.ajax GETs from my clients API. If I get them to add a "'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'" header, will it defo fix it? Just wanted to make sure before I ask them to do it!
[09:09:31] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: it's hard to have a quick answer without really understanding the kind of animation you want to do, "lift up off the page" is still difficult to picture
[09:09:40] <johnkpaul> nvalmo: are you trying to make a cross origin request?
[09:09:41] <blindMoe> are swing and bounce easing option built into jQuery?
[09:10:15] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: Yup. They dont have a JSON response, just XML so cant use JSONP.
[09:10:17] <johnkpaul> ?animate @ blindMoe
[09:10:17] <bot-t> blindMoe, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:10:42] <johnkpaul> nvalmo: CORS will work, but not on all browsers, so it depends on what you need to support
[09:10:59] <blindMoe> aww swing a linear
[09:11:06] <blindMoe> johnkpaul: thanks
[09:11:09] <johnkpaul> np
[09:11:15] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul. I'll show you when I get it finished. Should be soon. That's kind of why I left it so obtuse, it's complicated and can be a separate issue from just getting the images in the right place for the first time. I am almost there and I'll post a link back. I'ts pretty cool really.
[09:11:30] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: CORS? You mean that header I mentioned above? This is just for development. Production will be hosted on their servers I presume.
[09:11:44] <johnkpaul> ?g cross origin resource sharing @ nvalmo
[09:11:45] <bot-t> nvalmo, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[09:11:51] <johnkpaul> sorry, I shouldn't have used the jargon, yes, it is the headers
[09:12:26] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: It is good that I learn
[09:12:53] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: I assume by "not all browsers" you mean it wont for on IE < 9?
[09:13:42] <johnkpaul> I don't actually remember exactly nvalmo, I think that it might be IE8+
[09:14:18] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: Yeah, so wiki seems to say
[09:14:22] <kon__> when using jsonp to check if a username exists via the twitter api they send a 404 if the user doesn't exists but still send along the acutal json with the error message. but the done or always handlers never get called then. is there a simple workaround for that?
[09:14:30] <nvalmo> johnkpaul: Right, thanks for the help dood.
[09:14:37] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[09:15:21] <johnkpaul> kon__: that's a common problem, I'm pretty sure there are many SO questions about it, usually it's fixed by implementing a timer that checks
[09:15:49] <kon__> didn't find any particularily useful that's why i came here :D
[09:15:50] <johnkpaul> kon__: http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/3442/jsonabort.patch
[09:15:53] <chilversc_> not sure about the promise api, I normally handle that in the error event
[09:16:49] <kon__> awesome thanks for the patch!
[09:17:07] <johnkpaul> kon__: that patch doesn't give what you're looking for OOTB, but it will give you the ideas
[09:17:13] <qom2> http://jsfiddle.net/sGbe7/ â€“ if you click about a submenu appears, I need some clues how to make it disappear when you stop hovering/click in about again, thanks!
[09:17:14] <johnkpaul> read through it and see wht it's doing
[09:17:16] <kon__> yes, excellent!
[09:19:53] <shoky> qom2: first of all, don't bind the click event inside another event handler
[09:22:19] <shoky> qom2: so this is a cleaner starting point: http://jsfiddle.net/sGbe7/1/
[09:23:28] <qom2> thanks shoky! I've been looking on mouseover/mouseout, but don't understand how to apply it..
[09:24:14] <james13433> What should I use to replace all the html inside <div id="drop down">old content</div> ?
[09:24:18] <smykes> ajpiano: I just found out I have been making Resig cry himself to sleep...
[09:25:50] <nFFF> james13433 $('#dropdown').html(newHtml);
[09:26:03] <james13433> Thanks nFF, simple as that?
[09:26:14] <nFFF> ?html(string)

[09:27:26] <smykes> i should have used mustache on this project, and Im only now realizing it
[09:28:30] <qom2> shoky: I bow to you, amazing, thanks so much!
[09:28:41] <shoky> np
[09:29:20] <shoky> just make sure you understand the use of .hover with 2 callbacks. and the use of .toggle()
[09:29:30] <smykes> i have so much code that looks like this
[09:29:30] <smykes> http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide32
[09:30:16] * shoky weeps
[09:32:32] <smykes> in my defense i didnt know any better at thats how it was done i just continued it thinking it was the way to do it
[09:32:39] <smykes> then i listened to some yayquery
[09:34:55] <delinquentme> ok so I know about .bind and the like ...  but i have a div with a class that I modified after loading the page ...  by removing a "min_item" and adding a "min_item_active" class ... later on I test all items which have the "min_item" class  and the initial modified class doesn't  trigger the action
[09:35:43] <Tasser> is there a function that does css match below the current element?
[09:36:05] <smykes> tasser find
[09:36:07] <NoiseEee> Tasser: find(selector)
[09:36:08] <smykes> find)_
[09:37:06] <Tasser> thanks
[09:38:01] <delinquentme> are there known issues in 1.7.2 with post-page-render modifications to classes being wonky
[09:43:52] <BrotherRodriguez> is there a jQuery method similar to .html() that returns the HTML code for the element and its contents? .html() just returns contents.
[09:54:16] <MrPunkin> Can anyone offer any advice on debugging a crash that happens with device rotation in iOS?
[09:54:38] <smykes> is there a way use yes/nope to load json.js and excanvas?
[09:59:34] <Jon47> BrotherRodriguez: the DOM property would be outerHTML, assuming your collection only has one element you can do this: $collecton[0].outerHTML
[10:00:07] <Jon47> it wouldn't really work as a jquery method because the collection can contain multiple elements, so how do you return a string element reprsenting the outerHTML of multiple nodes..
[10:01:17] <BrotherRodriguez> Jon47 thanks, that works great.
[10:01:19] <smykes> SlexAxton: you rule
[10:01:33] <shoky> .html() only returns the innerHTML of the first in the collection
[10:03:19] <BrotherRodriguez> This works well. I need to create an element and then get the HTML. I had been creating a throw-away <div> container and then getting the .html() of it. This didn't satisfy me.
[10:03:47] <shoky> now you are saturated with satisfaction
[10:03:52] <BrotherRodriguez> with this x = $('<span>foo</span>'); x[0].outerHTML returns "<span>foo</span>" which is what I want
[10:03:55] <shoky> it suits you
[10:04:01] <BrotherRodriguez> it does indeed
[10:04:12] <mdhopkins> JQM question: i have ajaxEnabled: false set and it works mostly, but when I hit the back button to return to the site it calls the ajax and i get an extra appearance of the page. anyone know how to disable that?
[10:07:03] <chopkorn> i'm struggling with a success: that won't trigger, i get "syntaxerror: unexpected token U" from error's ErrorThrown
[10:08:11] <chopkorn> what gets returned from the php script is {"ok":"All is well"}
[10:08:25] <chopkorn> with Content-type: application/json
[10:10:13] <LakWork> is it possible using $.post to pass multiple parameters for a single name?
[10:10:35] <LakWork> do i need to use the string notation for the data vars?
[10:10:39] <delinquentme> http://jsfiddle.net/ZsaGq/  << i have a script that runs when a class  .min_item is clicked ... however that script it running when I click on a class of .min_item_active
[10:10:44] <delinquentme> thoughts?
[10:11:42] <smykes> too much code lol
[10:11:45] <smykes> can you simplifiy it
[10:12:42] <smykes> i have no idea where either of these classes arew without digging into your html
[10:13:05] <chopkorn> ok, if i remove datatype: json everything went well..
[10:13:10] <chopkorn> why >_<
[10:13:30] <smykes> was it json data?
[10:13:34] <chopkorn> i return it like this, so it should be json: echo json_encode (array ('ok'=>'OK'));
[10:13:58] <smykes> chopkorn:  http://jsonlint.com/
[10:14:37] <chopkorn> Valid JSO
[10:14:38] <chopkorn> N
[10:14:38] <Trisox> delinquentme: you could improve by caching the selectors
[10:14:54] <chopkorn> what the fuck..
[10:15:05] <chopkorn> now it works even if i have datatype json >_>
[10:15:32] <chopkorn> oh well, a full hour well spent. i don't even know how i fixed it..
[10:16:23] <smykes> gnomes
[10:16:25] <smykes> i blame gnomes
[10:16:29] <smykes> the scourge of the garden
[10:17:05] <SlexAxton> smyke: yepnope({ test: window.JSON, nope: 'json2.js', complete: function(){ init(); } });
[10:17:09] <chopkorn> too much peak oil on my brain tbh.
[10:17:11] <chopkorn> that's it.
[10:17:17] <Trisox> :D
[10:17:34] <chopkorn> got like 10% focus :P
[10:17:39] <smykes> SlexAxton: you are a gentleman and a scholar despite being a ginger
[10:18:33] <chopkorn> being ginger's bad now? :<
[10:18:41] <chopkorn> i thought it was the jews we were hating on..
[10:18:43] <Trisox> what does that has to do with anything
[10:18:51] <smykes> it was a joke
[10:19:06] <Trisox> oh next time tell us to laugh ;)
[10:19:07] <smykes> i always tell my ginger gf she is evil because of the hair
[10:19:11] <Trisox> hihi
[10:19:29] <chopkorn> black is considered a more evil color than red tbh.
[10:19:36] <chopkorn> so.. all asians are evil.
[10:19:49] <Trisox> they do look sinister..
[10:19:52] <shoky> derp
[10:19:52] <smykes> wtf
[10:20:13] <Trisox> any one here worked with knockoutjs?
[10:20:19] <shoky> Trisox: yes
[10:20:33] <Trisox> oh :-) nice did you like it?
[10:20:40] <Trisox> i'm playing around with it now
[10:20:46] <shoky> yep its great
[10:21:01] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/y9J75/12/ care to take a peek?
[10:21:05] <shoky> sure
[10:21:09] <delinquentme> Trisox, caching the selectors?
[10:21:35] <Trisox> yes delinquentme you use $('#something') over and over
[10:21:45] <Trisox> make variable inthe function cash it
[10:21:48] <smykes> SlexAxton: I meant no offense by that sorry if you were offended
[10:21:51] <Trisox> way faster
[10:22:05] <Trisox> shoky: its the ajax part that doesnt work proper
[10:22:36] <delinquentme> Trisox, you're saying DRY the code ... that doesnt fix the issues that im after but thanks for the advice
[10:22:43] <shoky> Trisox: why async: false
[10:22:57] <shoky> ?async
[10:22:58] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[10:22:59] <Trisox> just tying out stuff
[10:23:04] <shoky> k
[10:23:09] <SlexAxton> smykes: banned.
[10:23:15] <smykes> :D
[10:23:32] <Trisox> hey Slexy
[10:23:38] <smykes> ajpiano: took my ginger talk better SlexAxton ;)
[10:23:59] <Trisox> ajpiano: AKA the funk
[10:24:45] <SlexAxton> sup
[10:25:34] <Trisox> not much looking at knockout js
[10:26:12] <smykes> i am going to attempt to use the awesomly name yepnope
[10:26:13] <Trisox> i like the inline binding :D
[10:27:24] <smykes> SlexAxton: are conditional statements for style sheets faster than yepnope?
[10:27:27] <Trisox> i tried it once with modernizr
[10:27:37] <SlexAxton> for ie only
[10:27:43] <SlexAxton> yes, but they block
[10:27:50] <SlexAxton> usually you want that with styles though
[10:28:18] <Trisox> where you wanna use it for? smykes
[10:28:25] <smykes> the only two files i need to yepnope are excanvas and json2 worth it?
[10:29:02] <shoky> Trisox: i haven't used the mapping plugin too much
[10:29:06] <Trisox> mmm styles are faster
[10:29:15] <Trisox> how would you do it smykes
[10:29:16] <shoky> Trisox: but.. why are you passing an array to ko.mapping.fromJS
[10:30:16] <Trisox> well thats the part i try to figure out :D
[10:30:28] <shoky> just pass those 2 parameters as is, don't wrap them in an array
[10:30:54] <Trisox> i try to receive the json and update the table with observable's
[10:31:12] <shoky> but the original VM is not built with ko.mapping?
[10:31:47] <shoky> just an observableArray with non-observable objects inside?
[10:32:19] <SlexAxton> smykes: do it both way
[10:32:21] <SlexAxton> s
[10:32:26] <SlexAxton> and measure which one is faster
[10:32:33] <SlexAxton> then write a blog post about it
[10:32:49] <blindMoe> assuming that the plugin.settings.* variables are set correctly.. is there anything wrong with doing this?:  $(this).stop().animate({plugin.settings.direction : plugin.settings.distance}, plugin.settings.speed);
[10:33:12] <Trisox> no mapping is plugin
[10:33:30] <blindMoe> ?
[10:33:32] <shoky> what?
[10:33:55] <Trisox> ko.mapping = a plugin
[10:33:57] <shoky> blindMoe: seems fine
[10:34:00] <shoky> Trisox: yes
[10:34:10] <Trisox> http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/plugins-mapping.html
[10:34:12] <blindMoe> that is what I thought.. but aptana is throwing errors
[10:34:22] <shoky> Trisox: exactly. you're not following that
[10:34:52] <Trisox> mmm
[10:35:04] <smykes> SlexAxton: if you do a yayquery in the next week I will!
[10:35:13] <shoky> Trisox: To create a view model via the mapping plugin, replace the creation of viewModel in the code above with the ko.mapping.fromJS function:
[10:35:23] <shoky> var viewModel = ko.mapping.fromJS(data);
[10:35:33] <shoky> you didn't do that anywhere
[10:36:42] <blindMoe> shoky: that line throws an 'Unexpected token :' error ? not sure if I can use an object as the param name like that
[10:38:02] <shoky> blindMoe: actually yeah i guess you can't
[10:38:10] <blindMoe> shoky: interesting though.. I can do 'direction = plugin.settings.direction' and then use just 'direction' and it doesn't throw an error
[10:38:22] <jes> Object[object Object] has not method 'validate' how come?
[10:38:34] <shoky> blindMoe but it won't use that direction var
[10:38:44] <shoky> it'll just create a property 'direction'
[10:38:48] <shoky> i believe
[10:38:53] <blindMoe> hrmm
[10:38:56] <blindMoe> good point
[10:39:04] <blindMoe> might have to use a switch() I guess
[10:39:26] <blindMoe> how would someone use a dynamic variable in animate then>
[10:39:36] <shoky> or you could create the options object before the actuall animate call
[10:39:56] <shoky> var options = {};  options[ plugin.settings.direction ] = plugin.settings.distance;
[10:39:58] <shoky> etc
[10:40:07] <shoky> .animate(options, plugin.settings.speed)
[10:40:26] <blindMoe> ahh
[10:40:28] <shoky> properties, not options.
[10:40:34] <blindMoe> yeah
[10:40:36] <blindMoe> nice thanks
[10:40:45] <shoky> no_probby
[10:43:34] <Trisox> shoky: i think i dont need the mapping plugin
[10:44:53] <Whirl3d> so I am using .on({mouseenter: showMenu, mouseleave:hidemenu}) on a parent element of the menu, but it keeps closing even through I haven't moused out . Is it because the mouseleave event is bubbling up from its children? Do I need to restrict the mouseleave events to just the parent element?
[10:47:46] <Trisox> #menu > . parent > .children
[10:47:50] <Trisox> #menu > .parent > .children
[10:48:32] <Trisox> Whirl3d: using the > in a selector might help
[10:50:50] <shoky> Trisox: yea it's just a utility
[10:51:03] <Trisox> :)
[10:51:54] <batterhead> Does anyone know if .append() messes in any way with event handlers?
[10:52:14] <shoky> like in what way
[10:53:32] <paul_irish> like in the worst way.
[10:53:49] <batterhead> well i wrote a handler for right mouse click that does a few things and should be suppressing the default menu, but it has an append in it and that seems to break it
[10:53:52] <paul_irish> like pours syrup onto their eyebrows while they're sleeping
[10:54:06] <paul_irish> append() is such a jerk to the poor cute handlers
[10:54:10] <shoky> that's one half of yayquery right here next to me
[10:54:16] <shoky> i am going to faint and stuff
[10:54:33] <Trisox> shoky: keep it chill :D
[10:54:48] <paul_irish> stay cool stay cool
[10:54:51] <batterhead> wow big guns in here today ;)
[10:55:12] <Trisox> DONT SHOUT KEEEP IT COOL!!!
[10:55:13] <shoky> k. am calm
[10:55:18] <Trisox> i say E
[10:55:22] <Trisox> RELAX ;)
[10:55:34] <paul_irish> batterhead: so you have an contextmenu handler .. but it append()s ?
[10:55:46] <paul_irish> are you returning false at the end to kill the context menu? or..
[10:55:49] <Trisox> paul_irish: what about the hotpink wy take it out :(
[10:56:21] <batterhead> yes. appends both a screen (to capture the left click and hide my menu) and the div for the menu itself
[10:56:36] <paul_irish> Trisox: sorry :(

[10:57:23] <paul_irish> batterhead: don't know! but if you created a reduction for jsfiddle.. i bet 1) we'd be able to spot it and 2) you'd find the problem while reducing
[10:57:35] <Trisox> its a shame paul_irish :D
[10:57:42] <batterhead> k. i'm on it
[10:57:57] <smykes> BOO to abscense of hot pink
[10:58:06] <Trisox> hehe
[10:58:08] <smykes> someone fork it and add the pink back
[10:58:27] <Trisox> :-D
[10:58:55] <Trisox> thats lame i mean i get wy but still its funny to see no one changes it
[10:59:37] <Trisox>  neutral selection background color: Orange?
[10:59:40] <Trisox> ^^
[11:00:25] <batterhead> i like the hot pink
[11:00:35] <warrenparsons> Hot pinkâ€¦ must be discussing HTML5 Boilerplate.
[11:02:04] <Trisox> yup yup
[11:02:06] <smykes> its a lovely shade of pink
[11:02:07] <I3ooI3oo> Who uses OSX as a template...
[11:02:17] <Trisox> i use osx...
[11:02:48] <warrenparsons> At least one of our sites still has the hot pink default. Can't remember which off the top of my head.
[11:04:06] <supsup> well dropbox supports them, so I just moved all my files to google drive, them symbolic'd em over to dropbox bam problem solved.
[11:04:18] <supsup> opps wrong window sorry
[11:04:23] <smykes> lol
[11:04:27] <Trisox> :D
[11:04:30] <smykes> i heard google drive was SLOOOW
[11:04:31] <I3ooI3oo> I was wondering
[11:04:37] <warrenparsons> At least it wasn't pornographic. (This time)
[11:04:38] <Trisox> supsup #html5
[11:04:47] <Trisox> haha warrenparsons
[11:04:57] <delinquentme> there isnt anything to get all elements including the calling one ... something like a siblings()
[11:05:07] <ajpiano> ?andSelf @ delinquentme
[11:05:08] <bot-t> delinquentme, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[11:05:18] <smykes> i have told a coworker via text message that i wanted to do unsavory things to him... oops
[11:05:59] <warrenparsons> My best one was ripping somebody to shreds in IM, and realizing after I'd hit enter that I had typed it into the window I had open with him, instead of my other friend.
[11:06:29] <smykes> I jsut had a 5 minute conversation with a coworker, thinking it was another coworker on IM
[11:10:44] <truk77> Hmm, this might be sort of a vague question, but, if I'm writing jquery functions that get passed the elements they affect, is it better to have the functions take a jquery object, or a selector?
[11:10:54] <paul_irish> smykes: did it involve syrup and eyebrows?
[11:11:04] <paul_irish> that's unsavory. rather sweet.
[11:11:23] <paul_irish> truk77: probably best to write them as jquery plugins
[11:11:30] <paul_irish> even tho they are your own jquery plugins.
[11:12:09] <warrenparsons> Deciding when something should be a plugin is something I still struggle with.
[11:12:23] <truk77> paul_irish: I'm mostly a jquery n00b, so I ask honestly..is that gonna be the best time/value tradeoff?
[11:12:29] <paul_irish> $.fn.trukify = function(){  this.each( .....  );  return this; });
[11:12:32] <paul_irish> yes definitely
[11:12:49] <paul_irish> the question you just asked is like.. the best question to lead you to writing it as a plugin
[11:12:50] <Whirl3d> so, the shortcut $(elem).mouseleave(function () { is really just $(elem).bind("mouseleave", function () .....but different from $(elem).on("mouseleave", function () ,,, in so much as .on handles bubbling, of child elements, but the other don't. Is that right?
[11:13:12] <dougb> i'm trying to load data based on a links anchor, ie. '#hello-world', but it reloads the page whenever i click it...i thought that it wasn't supposed to reload the page?
[11:13:33] <truk77> Okay paul_irish, I will check out some plugin-writing docs.
[11:13:36] <Whirl3d> dougb, are you returning false in your click handler?
[11:13:49] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: I'm pretty sure .bind() and .on() are functionally identical in that case.
[11:15:00] <dougb> Whirl3d: i just tried that, the only issue is it doesn't send the anchor to the URl at the top which is what I'm looking for
[11:15:05] <Whirl3d> so, then can you specify the element your are binding .on to as the context for it's own mouseenter evern
[11:15:11] <dougb> *URL in the address bar
[11:15:37] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:15:44] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question re: plugin development
[11:15:46] <Whirl3d> dougb, check out bbq or hashchange.
[11:15:49] <brianloveswords> warrenparsons: Whirl3d: bind and on are functionally equivalent in that case, see: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L974
[11:16:00] <Whirl3d> ?.bbq @ dougb
[11:16:01] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".bbq" in jQuery Docs.
[11:16:07] <Whirl3d> drats.
[11:16:18] <ProLoser|Work> I pass a configuration object to my plugin, and inside the plugin i proceed to build on top of the configuration object for use internally.
[11:16:21] <dougb> Whirl3d: i've heard of bbq, i'll look into it
[11:16:22] <dougb> thanks!
[11:16:38] <ProLoser|Work> However, if I pass the same object to another instance of the plugin, all the modifications from the first use have passed through to the original object due to reference
[11:16:57] <ProLoser|Work> is it common practice to clone the passed configuration object inside of plugins before you start working with it? or is that overkill?
[11:16:58] <Whirl3d> dougb, I found bbq was a little overkill for my tastes. I used the hashchange plugin for the same effect (same author, same website)
[11:17:22] <ProLoser|Work> it's only an issue if i want to re-use the configuration options multiple times
[11:17:57] <dougb> Whirl3d: this one, correct? http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/hashchange/
[11:18:06] <Whirl3d> ProLoser|Work, I think it's common practice to extend the parameter with the plugin's defaults
[11:18:26] <Whirl3d> err. the other way around. Either way, it's essentially cloning...I believe
[11:18:47] <Whirl3d> dougb, that's the one. it's super easy to use and works great.
[11:19:01] <dougb> perfect, thank you!
[11:20:32] <Whirl3d> ProLoser|Work, I see a lot of plugins do var options=$.extend({},defaults, optsparam);
[11:22:17] <delinquentme> $('.min_item')
[11:22:40] <delinquentme> will only match .min_item classes items right?
[11:22:47] <delinquentme> NOT .min_item_active
[11:23:21] <gehsekky> depends
[11:23:34] <gehsekky> on if the .min_item_active item also has .min_item
[11:24:00] <Whirl3d> delinquentme, if you mean literally .min_item_active, it won't match. But if you mean .min_item.active (where active is added to min_item's class, then it will match.
[11:24:22] <Whirl3d> srry, I just saw you replied gehsekky
[11:26:48] <delinquentme> ok because I have .min_item_active ... which is running a script initalized on $('min_item') classed items =/
[11:28:41] <delinquentme> like the page loads and ob1.active     ... jquery interactions remove the .active  from obj1   ... however it still responds to actions *ONLY* specified on objects with the .active class
[11:28:44] <delinquentme> wth
[11:32:31] <xec> delinquentme: is this "action" an event of sorts? if so, how did you bind?
[11:33:17] <delinquentme> xec, $('.active').click( function(){ // do stuff })
[11:33:54] <delinquentme> so the page loads obj1.active ... i run another action and remove the .active ... and a second to put it back on
[11:34:01] <delinquentme> after its added back on
[11:34:21] <delinquentme> it doesnt react
[11:34:56] <delinquentme> wait ! not ignore that
[11:35:00] <delinquentme> no* ignore that
[11:35:08] <xec> delinquentme: well, the binding is run only once, meaning whatever had the "active" class when you ran that code you pasted is going to have the click handler attached no matter if it loses the class name later on
[11:36:06] <osmosis> when I view source on a page, all I see is a div with "loading.." in it, but when I view the elements in the javascript console, there is much more data. How do I figure out where this data is being populated from?
[11:36:12] <BillCriswell> I have a list of links on the left side of an image and then multiple points on an image to the right that can also be clicked to go to the same thing. Should I be using javascript to create the HTML for the "points" or should I just output that HTML normally?
[11:36:14] <xec> delinquentme: if this is the issue, have a look at delegates, ?see on
[11:36:27] <xec> ?on @ delinquentme
[11:36:27] <bot-t> delinquentme, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:36:44] <BillCriswell> Either way would work... but I'm not sure which would be best.
[11:37:25] <gho5t> unless you're using a template or a widget, i generally say to keep the html separate if possible
[11:37:34] <osmosis> maybe related to   type=â€‹"text/â€‹x-jquery-tmpl"
[11:37:54] <BillCriswell> gho5t: Think I should do $('.item').each() then create the points in there/
[11:38:07] <delinquentme> yeahh i think thats what I want
[11:38:33] <gho5t> BillCriswell: unless there's a reason why it'd be better to do it in js, I usually keep the html separate e.g. by putting the html on the page itself
[11:39:10] <BillCriswell> gho5t: Got it. My only concern in that is SEO related cause it'll be linking to the same thing as the list of links it corresponds with.
[11:39:23] <BillCriswell> So it'll be like a list of two of the same links...
[11:39:28] <gho5t> gotcha
[11:39:30] <BillCriswell> Kind of hate thinking in terms of SEO.
[11:39:39] <gho5t> if that's a real concern then it sounds like js might be better
[11:41:35] <osmosis> what does  type=â€‹"text/â€‹x-jquery-tmpl"   mean?
[11:41:47] <osmosis> what is a jquery template?
[11:41:59] <BillCriswell> osmosis: Google it. =)
[11:42:10] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[11:43:09] <supsup> its no longer maintained or developed.  they working on jqueryui version
[11:43:45] <BillCriswell> gho5t: Think I should worry about making sure the markup for the js generated content is semantic? Like the points I was going to make into a <ul> with <li> for each.. Think it'd be ok to just use a div with <a>s set to display block?
[11:44:19] <BillCriswell> I think I worry too much about the wrong shit.
[11:44:25] <gho5t> no you're right
[11:44:28] <gho5t> a list is better
[11:44:38] <gho5t> always use lists when something is...a list
[11:44:50] <gho5t> i do the same thing to be honest
[11:44:58] <gho5t> more time spent picking out classnames than coding
[11:44:58] <BillCriswell> It's annoying as shit haah.
[11:46:04] <BillCriswell> It drives me crazy but I can't help it.
[11:54:07] <devnill> is there anything like $.change() that will bind to future elements in a manner similiar to $.on()?
[11:55:18] <NoiseEee> devnill:  .on('change')
[11:55:39] <BillCriswell> devnill: You can do like... $.on('change', '.foo', function(e) { console.log("Hiyooooo"); });
[11:56:21] <BillCriswell> $el.on( ... )
[11:57:01] <BillCriswell> $el could be like... body or something?
[11:57:51] <devnill> that wont work NoiseEee
[11:57:54] <devnill> i tried that
[11:58:15] <devnill> http://massiveboom.com/test.html#
[11:59:01] <supsup> why not just use .on with 'change'?
[11:59:03] <devnill> http://massiveboom.com/scripts/test.js is the script
[11:59:09] <supsup> o
[11:59:12] <supsup> someone already said that
[11:59:17] <devnill> i tried on('change') and nothing happened
[11:59:19] <BillCriswell> devnill: Try $('body').on('click', 'a', function(e){ console.log("Woo!"); });
[11:59:40] <NoiseEee> $('#test').on('change','.classYouCareAbout',function(ev) { alert('oy!'); });
[12:00:51] <devnill> thats whatthats what I did. It didn't work. onclick works but change does nothing
[12:00:53] <pace_t_zulu|win> hey guys ... i'm working with jquery-ui dialogs .. i have links in the dialog ... when i make the dialog modal - the links don't work ... anyone have any idea how to fix that?
[12:01:17] <supsup> NoiseEee why you use ev? 200 percent more descriptive? (random)
[12:01:32] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[12:01:50] <supsup> pace :  make js example, do the links have hrefs?
[12:04:26] <NoiseEee> devnill: http://jsfiddle.net/GjLGu/
[12:04:28] <NoiseEee> supsup: habit
[12:04:32] <supsup> do they have events attached to them preventing them from workign etc...impossibel to tell without a example
[12:05:00] <supsup> cool.
[12:05:38] <supsup> an example bah.
[12:07:21] <devnill> that only alerts when i click a button
[12:08:09] <NoiseEee> devnill: nope. it alerts when you focus off an input element.
[12:08:15] <NoiseEee> ie: change fires
[12:08:25] <devnill> not in my browser?
[12:08:25] <pace_t_zulu|win> sup sup ... links do have hrefs
[12:08:31] <devnill> im using chromium
[12:08:45] <devnill> it alerts i when i change focus and hit add me
[12:08:46] <BillCriswell> devnill: Are you getting any errors?
[12:09:01] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup ... links do have hrefs ... links work when the dialog is *not* modal
[12:09:04] <NoiseEee> devnill: press tab to go to anther input
[12:09:05] <devnill> nope
[12:09:12] <devnill> nothing
[12:09:26] <devnill> it only is triggering if i click an input and then add text then hit 'add me'
[12:09:27] <supsup> z-index issue maybe u have some weird css on anchor tags
[12:09:32] <NoiseEee> devnill: oh well.  http://jsfiddle.net/GjLGu/ clearly works.
[12:09:34] <supsup> make the ones in your console have higher z-index
[12:09:35] <devnill> is this not what should be happening?
[12:09:49] <devnill> well I guess its a browser issue with chromium
[12:09:52] <NoiseEee> devnill: ya know, if the value changes and all
[12:09:55] <NoiseEee> devnill: works fine in my chrome.
[12:09:58] <supsup> technically the popup of the dialog should be higher than the modal.
[12:10:04] <devnill> are there any other methods
[12:10:09] <supsup> but maybe you have other css rules winning out
[12:10:19] <devnill> I don't want something that won't work in all modern browsers
[12:10:43] <devnill> the version of chromium is a couple of months old so it *should* work
[12:11:00] <NoiseEee> devnill: if http://jsfiddle.net/GjLGu/2/ isn't working for you, i don't know what to say
[12:11:09] <BillCriswell> Restart your browser.
[12:11:22] <supsup> as from documentation: Modal dialogs create an overlay below the dialog but above other page elements.
[12:11:22] <BillCriswell> Also your computer. Weird shit happens.
[12:11:34] <NoiseEee> devnill: you ARE changing the value of the new <input> elements right?
[12:11:34] <supsup> your calling the dialog after the page is loaded right not like halfway
[12:11:51] <supsup> modal needs to draw above the whole body not just part of it
[12:12:27] <devnill> ok, browser restarted still delaying until i hit add me.
[12:12:28] <devnill> weird
[12:12:41] <supsup> so without example: A) you have some very specific z-index set for all anchor tags thats making the modal lose the z-index war, or perhaps your calling the dialog before the document is ready
[12:12:47] <devnill> so are there any methods beyond on()?
[12:14:12] <supsup> when i click add me it adds a input in chrome
[12:14:20] <supsup> but on hover over it should or something?
[12:14:20] <devnill> that happens
[12:14:34] <devnill> i want to trigger the function whenever the input changes
[12:14:44] <devnill> and all future elements as well
[12:14:45] <supsup> what input when u type something in the first input box?
[12:15:11] <supsup> yah typing in the box triggers the event after i change out
[12:15:16] <supsup> so nm i misunderstood appears to work
[12:15:21] <devnill> when i try .change or on('change') it only binds to current elements, not ones added later
[12:15:32] <NoiseEee> devnill: ...
[12:15:35] <NoiseEee> best of luck
[12:15:51] <gho5t> and now we part ways
[12:15:57] <NoiseEee> devnill: do you understand that the 'change' event fires only after an input loses focus?
[12:16:08] <supsup> devnill:  are u saying A) you put your cursor in the input.  B) you type.  C) you press teh tab button and it does not do an alert?
[12:16:20] <devnill> i don't want it on an input, that was an example
[12:16:24] <xec> devnill: it looks like it's working to me. you need to both change and lose focus for change to occu
[12:16:25] <NoiseEee> devnill: ohhh i see
[12:16:27] <xec> occur
[12:16:37] <NoiseEee> you're asking about something and providing a completely different example devnill
[12:16:38] <devnill> let me start over. I'm going to be using .draggable
[12:16:45] <NoiseEee> see ya!
[12:16:48] <devnill> Sorry if i was unclear
[12:18:10] <supsup> yah still don't get what he was trying to do hah, maybe next time break it out into steps like i did and at what point is not doing what you expect.
[12:18:31] <devnill> I just tried it on my other laptop
[12:18:38] <devnill> definately this version of chromium
[12:18:41] <devnill> chrome works fine
[12:18:55] <devnill> the debian repo is extremely out of date
[12:19:12] <devnill> its on version 6 of chromium
[12:20:30] <gho5t> $("#foo").append($item); <== if $item is a jquery object, is $item.html() being called implicitly?
[12:20:37] <nkdev> I just want to declare to this chatroom how much I love jquery!
[12:20:39] <gho5t> it seems to work fine
[12:20:49] <gho5t> but in other instances this technique isn't working
[12:21:02] <gho5t> such as $("#matters div:first ul").append("<div>" + $html + "</div>");
[12:21:06] <gho5t> it renders [Object]
[12:25:07] <xec> gho5t: .html is not run on that first snippet of yours, what you do is move the DOM element(s)
[12:25:23] <xec> gho5t: i am assuming that's what's contained in $item
[12:25:43] <gho5t> sorrrry
[12:25:48] <gho5t> I mean $html for both
[12:25:54] <gho5t> both jq objects
[12:26:09] <gho5t> dammit
[12:26:25] <xec> gho5t: in your second snippet you're concatenating it with a string
[12:26:35] <gho5t> right
[12:26:49] <xec> any object concatenated to a string is going to become "[object Object]"
[12:26:58] <gho5t> so if it's not concatenated it will "move the dom elements" ?
[12:27:34] <xec> yes
[12:27:44] <xec> basically
[12:28:20] <gho5t> ok. not exactly sure the process but sounds like the same result as implicitly calling .html()
[12:29:13] <xec> no, calling html will get the elements as as html string and then append, effectively copying it
[12:33:56] <imsky> oh don piano
[12:34:32] <Carlitta87> can u call a function in document.ready?
[12:35:32] <xec> Carlitta87: of course, what makes you think otherwise?
[12:35:49] <Carlitta87> xec, i did it before n it broke my accordion
[12:36:30] <xec> if you pastebin your code, we could take a look at where you may have gone wrong
[12:36:40] <antihero> Is there a way to manually trigger document.load?
[12:36:59] <warrenparsons> antihero: For what purpose?
[12:37:16] <antihero> warrenparsons: I'm using pjax, and that means some scripts don't trigger as the page doesn't reload
[12:37:37] <antihero> warrenparsons: so I need to trigger them
[12:37:58] <warrenparsons> antihero: Do you mean that some of your event handlers aren't working because you're calling in elements via AJAX?
[12:38:03] <antihero> alternatively I could have them all run from a callback but thisway seemed cleaner as it would more accurately simulate a page loading
[12:38:10] <antihero> warrenparsons: Effectively yeah
[12:38:26] <antihero> warrenparsons: because they are all bound in the $(function(){})
[12:38:32] <warrenparsons> antihero: Then you should be using event delegation. jQuery's .on() method includes that functionality.
[12:38:44] <warrenparsons> ?on @ antihero
[12:38:45] <bot-t> antihero, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:38:58] <antihero> warrenparsons: Aye, but isn't that slower? If I know when I need to re-bind them surely that would be more efficient?
[12:39:20] <lotus> hey, I need a good jquery dropdown menu without any style
[12:39:31] <lotus> it has to support nested lists
[12:39:50] <lotus> I can't find a simple one that just shows/hides ul's when you mouse over the parent LI
[12:39:55] <warrenparsons> antihero: Not necessarily. If you're delegating everything to the document or body, then you can cause performance issues in some cases. Most of the time, you would delegate to the nearest ancestor element that is in the page at load time.
[12:40:29] <warrenparsons> antihero: So if you're loading AJAX content into div#myAjaxWrapper, you'd delegate to that.
[12:40:39] <antihero> warrenparsons: ah, I see. Neat!
[12:41:10] <warrenparsons> antihero: You'd typically only delegate to body or document when your affected elements could appear anywhere in the document. Somewhat rare.
[12:41:11] <antihero> I'll have a play with that.
[12:41:18] <antihero> warrenparsons: Aye, gotcha.
[12:41:38] <warrenparsons> antihero: Yep. And .on() makes it a lot easier than prior to 1.7.
[12:41:53] <warrenparsons> antihero: Well, consistent in its approach and thus easier to grasp.
[12:42:59] <antihero> warrenparsons: Thing is its not just for events
[12:43:08] <antihero> there's code to build some dom
[12:43:25] <warrenparsons> antihero: Ahh.
[12:43:51] <warrenparsons> antihero: You could *try* $(document).trigger('load'), but I'm not sure if that works.
[12:44:06] <warrenparsons> antihero: Typically you're better off re-calling your functions in the AJAX callback.
[12:44:14] <antihero> warrenparsons: Word

[12:49:41] <PilotBob> anyone know anything about the jQueryUI position? I am trying to get collision to work, but it doesn't seem to be firing?
[12:50:00] <imsky> collision
[12:50:02] <imsky> ?
[12:50:04] <PilotBob>  // Collision detection for Menu Items     $("ul.ModuleMenu ul").position({         collision: function () { alert("collision"); return "flip" }     });
[12:51:13] <imsky> hoho wtf is this
[12:51:44] <vpv4oo> why isnt this maps integration working? without binding it to "click:" on a static page it works perfectly... http://jsfiddle.net/HJ6gc/1/

[12:52:33] <vpv4oo> integrating the ovi maps api in the <head> no problem, with $getScript it tells me that it doesnt know the map functions from the api
[12:52:43] <imsky> PilotBob, sorry man i don't know what it does or what you're trying to do
[12:52:54] <PilotBob> imsky: I'm wondering if because the UI items are display: none when I call position on them it isn't attaching for some reason.
[12:52:58] <georgestephanis> okay, wtf was that
[12:53:12] <imsky> ZALGO HE COMETH OH GOD XMLLLL
[12:53:35] <imsky> PilotBob, no clue mate. jquery ui is deeply broken
[12:53:40] <imsky> except for .draggable
[12:53:46] <imsky> which seems to be bulletproof
[12:54:16] <PilotBob> imsky: from what I read, if an element is positioned off the screen... but maybe it only fires when I use position to set the position.. I'm not sure. Docs are very week.
[12:54:53] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: got it working with the following line:
[12:55:01] <pace_t_zulu|win> $('a', theDialog).each( function() { $(this).click( function(e) { window.location.href = $(this).attr('href'); }); });
[12:55:19] <supsup> word
[12:55:41] <imsky> PilotBob, yes they are. use something else
[12:56:11] <imsky> pace_t_zulu|win, why the each?
[12:56:25] <PilotBob> imsky: any suggestions? Need a menu that does edge detection to ensure menu dropdown/flyout is visible.
[12:56:26] <pace_t_zulu|win> imsky: multiple links
[12:56:42] <imsky> pace_t_zulu|win, yeah i got that. $() returns an array
[12:57:05] <imsky> PilotBob, what should happen if menu is offscreen?
[12:57:05] <pace_t_zulu|win> imsky: what's your point
[12:57:17] <imsky> pace_t_zulu|win, enjoy your inefficient code brother 4/20 puff puff pass
[12:57:28] <NoiseEee> pace_t_zulu|win: his point is:  $('a',theDialog).on('click',function(e) { } );
[12:57:37] <PilotBob> imsky: it should just adjust its position so the whole element ul) is visible.
[12:57:56] <imsky> PilotBob, on which event? click of the menu opener element?
[12:58:01] <pace_t_zulu|win> NoiseEee: does that implicity apply the click to each element in the array?
[12:58:24] <PilotBob> imsky: yes, although my menu is pure CSS at this point... no JS is being used yet.
[12:58:28] <NoiseEee> pace_t_zulu|win: tias
[12:58:45] <imsky> PilotBob, it wouldn't be hard to roll your own. i'd steer clear of jquery ui unless it's specifically what you need
[12:59:28] <pace_t_zulu|win> NoiseEee: "tias" ?
[12:59:40] <imsky> ?tias
[12:59:41] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:59:59] <pace_t_zulu|win> friendly bunch this is
[13:00:14] <imsky> lol you should try #web or #css
[13:00:39] <imsky> #web got taken over by sweaty ass bros and #css is full of offshore labor trying to vertically center things
[13:00:51] <someprimetime_> sweaty ass bros?
[13:00:57] * imsky says no more
[13:01:08] <pace_t_zulu|win> so what's the point of .each() ?
[13:01:19] <RichieEvans> anyone have any ideas why my jQuery slider is making my scrolling laggy and jerky?
[13:01:20] <ow1n> Is there a good way to handle an empty response with jqueryUI autocomplete?
[13:01:30] <imsky> OH GOOD MORE JQUERY UI PROBLEMS
[13:01:45] <ajpiano> imsky: can you tone it down a bit
[13:01:46] <supsup> vpv4oo pretty sure it does not work due to cross domain issue
[13:01:54] <ow1n> Sorry imsky is that off-topic, or do you just not like jqueryUI?
[13:01:54] <ajpiano> help or don't help, commentary doesn't really do much good
[13:01:57] <imsky> ajpiano, if only the library "just worked"
[13:02:08] <imsky> ow1n, both. jquery ui is the first and last solution to every ui problem ever
[13:02:10] <RichieEvans> you know theres a javascript irc if your so pro :)
[13:02:22] <someprimetime_> pace_t_zulu|win: it's a for each loop that iterates through objects in the dom
[13:02:25] <imsky> RichieEvans, i'm a gold star js developer.mcse csee and bcse
[13:02:35] <imsky> cisco certified and i got an ajax coupon
[13:02:39] <someprimetime_> the point of it is to loop through things
[13:02:41] <someprimetime_> read the docs
[13:02:44] <ajpiano> pace_t_zulu|win: sometimes you need to iterate over the collection of elements for some arbitrary reason besides applying a jQuery function to each one
[13:02:46] <vpv4oo> supsup: so if i would put the script on the same server as the js it might work you say?
[13:02:49] <someprimetime_> ? .each @ pace_t_zulu|win
[13:02:49] <bot-t> pace_t_zulu|win, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:03:14] <supsup> if its the same domain as the .js file
[13:03:42] <supsup> u can test success tho anyway see if u get that far
[13:03:44] <supsup> using console.log
[13:04:06] <supsup> why not just include the script directly?  getScript is just a shortcut for $.ajax
[13:04:14] <vpv4oo> it gets into the part in the success-part of $.getScript, the coleole.log comment in there will be in the console
[13:04:30] <pace_t_zulu|win> so basically for .each() is needed when you need to apply non-jquery code to an array of elements matched to a selector?
[13:04:30] <someprimetime_> getScript is NOT a shortcut for .ajax() lol
[13:04:44] <someprimetime_> wait
[13:04:45] <supsup> no?
[13:04:46] <imsky> yes it is
[13:04:46] <someprimetime_> i'm thinking of something else
[13:04:49] <someprimetime_> my fault
[13:05:03] <supsup> i got lol'd ;/
[13:05:08] <someprimetime_> sorry
[13:05:11] * someprimetime_ hugs you
[13:05:12] <supsup> heh jk np
[13:05:17] <RichieEvans> http://jsfiddle.net/tvkAP/ I'm thinking the writing to console on each animation might be causing the scrolling lagâ€¦ what do you think?
[13:05:34] <pace_t_zulu|win> so ... with regards to a click event ... what's the best way to bind the event ... .click() or .on('click') or .bind('click')
[13:05:42] <pace_t_zulu|win> and is there any difference really?
[13:05:45] <someprimetime_> pace_t_zulu|win: on()
[13:05:50] <imsky> yeah huge difference brah
[13:05:59] <imsky> just eh read that there api and er stuff
[13:05:59] <ow1n> Hm, so: UI autocomplete, empty response, no takers?
[13:06:00] <pace_t_zulu|win> someprimetime_: why is that
[13:06:12] <someprimetime_> because it preserves your event handlers if you end up adding elements to dom inside of it
[13:06:13] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: .click() uses .on() internally. It's just a convenience method.
[13:06:37] <antihero> warrenparsons: When doing delegation with on, how do I get the $(element) that was clicked on (or whatever) ?
[13:06:38] <someprimetime_> or doing some sort of dom manip within it
[13:06:38] <ajpiano> ow1n: the typical thing is for ntohing to be shown and the box to close
[13:06:44] <ajpiano> and then the person just types into the input normally
[13:06:48] <someprimetime_> antihero: $(this)?
[13:06:59] <warrenparsons> antihero: What someprimetime_ said
[13:07:06] <antihero> someprimetime_: That returns the div with pjax, I think?
[13:07:13] <imsky> loooool
[13:07:17] <ajpiano> antihero: event.target also works
[13:07:23] <imsky> ^
[13:07:28] <antihero> ajpiano: Cheers. How do I make that into a jQuery object?
[13:07:32] <imsky> don't ruin a good lol session with reasonable advice >:|
[13:07:35] <ajpiano> $(event.target)
[13:07:35] <pace_t_zulu|win> is it necessary to .unbind() before applying .on('click' ?
[13:07:37] <ow1n> ajpiano: I'm not sure what you mean by the box closing. Why would it be open if there were no results?
[13:07:46] <ajpiano> ow1n: exactly
[13:08:08] <ajpiano> maybe you had some results and then you filtered further and then there were none
[13:08:15] <ajpiano> either way, once you get to no results, there's no box
[13:08:16] <ajpiano> what's to handle?
[13:08:21] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: Usually not. And .off() is the current recommended way to unbind event handlers.
[13:08:43] <ow1n> So: Assume no results because nothing happened? The trouble is I'd like to have a "working" animation showing up in the field to show that an autocomplete query is running
[13:08:51] <ow1n> I just don't know how to turn it off for no results
[13:09:06] <pace_t_zulu|win> warrenparsons: so is there upside to doing .off('click').on('click', function(e) { ... } ) ?
[13:09:13] <ajpiano> ow1n: are you doing a remote request in the autocomplete
[13:09:19] <ow1n> yes
[13:09:20] <vpv4oo> supsup: now i see that it makes a GET for that jsl.js when its on the same server, returning 200 OK. funny thing is, that it does not get into the succeeded part of $.getScript anymore where i have console.log("ovi script loaded");
[13:09:24] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: Only if you had a need to unbind a previously set click event handler.
[13:10:12] <ajpiano> ow1n: with source: "foo.php" or with source: function() { }
[13:11:16] <supsup> vpv4oo :  does that .js script also do ajax stuff?
[13:11:34] <ow1n> ajpiano: source: "foo.php"
[13:11:42] <pace_t_zulu|win> warrenparsons: so using .on('click') will attach an additional function assuming a function is already attached?
[13:11:45] <vpv4oo> supsup: good question, its from http://api.maps.ovi.com/devguide/getting_started.html
[13:11:50] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: That's right.
[13:12:04] <ajpiano> ow1n: if you use the source: function( request, response) { } syntax, you will be able to have a callback to your ajax call
[13:12:14] <pace_t_zulu|win> warrenparsons: thanks for your patience with my basic questions :)
[13:12:14] <ajpiano> so you can show/hide the loading indicator just during the search and after it's complete
[13:12:28] <vpv4oo> supsup: i dont really know what it does, its minified and unreadable
[13:12:33] <ow1n> Thanks ajpiano, I'll look into it
[13:12:42] <ow1n> I appreciate the help ajpiano
[13:12:42] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: No problem. I wish .on/.off had been thought of ages ago. Makes the whole thing much easier to understand.
[13:12:50] <ajpiano> ow1n: cool. yeah you just end up handling $.ajax yourself
[13:12:59] <pace_t_zulu|win> so supsup ... the better way to rebind hrefs to links in a modal dialog is the following line of code ...
[13:13:01] <pace_t_zulu|win> $('a', thisPopupMenu).on('click', function(e) { window.location.href = $(this).attr('href'); });
[13:13:09] <ajpiano> ow1n: take a look at the remote with caching example... and then remove the cache part from the code :)
[13:14:15] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: That should work as expected. For more fun, thisPopupMenu.find('a').onâ€¦ is marginally faster.
[13:14:50] <vpv4oo> supsup: if it would also ajax elements in its loading process, would that be the reason for the rest of my js not to finish?
[13:15:33] <supsup> i'd start making simple examples like on that google api page
[13:16:00] <pace_t_zulu|win> warrenparsons: why is that?
[13:16:06] <pace_t_zulu|win> actually ... nevermind
[13:16:13] <pace_t_zulu|win> i'm sure i'm about to be told to read the api
[13:16:24] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: .find() is slightly faster than providing context in a jQuery selector.
[13:16:46] <vpv4oo> integrating google maps api with jquery will probably not be a problem, since there are simple plugins for jquery handling that... i would just prefer to have that ovi embedded :/ but if i cant make it working, oh well... ill take google maps
[13:17:04] <supsup> thats not google maps
[13:17:08] <supsup> it's using navteq maps
[13:17:10] <supsup> fromw aht i understand
[13:17:13] <warrenparsons> pace_t_zulu|win: I'm not sure if that's clearly outlined in the API docs. It's a rather tiny difference.
[13:17:17] <supsup> maybe i'm wrong did not read it all
[13:17:29] <supsup> Nokia provides several services with the Maps API offering.
[13:17:37] <supsup> nokia = navteq
[13:18:42] <vpv4oo> supsup: yeah, that thing i have atm is nokia/ovi/navteq something, i just answered to your suggestion to use the google maps api examples
[13:20:25] <vpv4oo> the simple examples on the dev intro page work flawlessly, the code i have in the fiddle is the most simple ones of their dynamic map examples copied into a click: function of jquery.. i asumed it would get more simple than that if i wanted to .load() a page containing an ovi maps div
[13:20:27] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: i've recently discovered that google maps geocoding api doesn't use a database that is as up-to-date as http://maps.google.com ... really annoying
[13:20:36] <pace_t_zulu|win> google maps = teleatlas
[13:20:56] <vpv4oo> *would=wouldnt
[13:21:22] <xxiao> where can I find plugin for the new jquery release these days?
[13:21:42] <xxiao> github still is not complete for that, if anything
[13:21:43] <supsup> you sure that it does not require api key?
[13:22:14] <xxiao> should i grab the modules from archive? is it sync-ed up with new jquery releases?
[13:23:07] <supsup> is this what your trying to do?  (without click ) http://jsfiddle.net/mxMNm/3/
[13:24:48] <supsup> here is with click event http://jsfiddle.net/mxMNm/4/
[13:24:55] <supsup> notice 2/3/4 are progressive
[13:24:59] <supsup> starting at basic example
[13:25:01] <supsup> and moving up
[13:25:02] <vpv4oo> exactly. this on a page, say foobar.php. that foobar.php loaded into <div id="content"> on click: of a menu item. the library is only needed on foobar.php, therefore trying to get jquery to load it on click: also
[13:25:07] <supsup> to add compex
[13:26:16] <andrew9184> if im returning a text/plain into a data from a get request, how do i parse it to see if it contains a string
[13:26:26] <supsup> moved click up : http://jsfiddle.net/mxMNm/5/
[13:26:40] <andrew9184> i tried function(data) { if (data == 'hello') {alert('hi'); }
[13:26:42] <andrew9184> but no luck there
[13:26:53] <aaa> xxxx
[13:27:08] <vpv4oo> supsup: where are you loading the actual api .js?
[13:27:15] <supsup> on left side
[13:27:19] <supsup> Manage Resources
[13:27:24] <supsup> u load it as a <script>
[13:27:31] <supsup> it says this at start of api docs
[13:28:21] <vpv4oo> supsup: if i load the jsl.js in my <head> like a normal js, it works for me as well. trying to get it to load with getScript(), because its only needed on one subpart of the site
[13:28:32] <supsup> thats cross domain
[13:28:34] <supsup> dont' work
[13:28:51] <supsup> as far as i understand anyway
[13:28:58] <supsup> i could be wrong on that
[13:29:09] <supsup> might work if you put it on same domain
[13:29:24] <supsup> the js on your server. but then i think that calls more js
[13:29:24] <vpv4oo> cross domain as in, its loading the jsl.js from the nokia server?
[13:29:38] <Vordreller> Question: I'm trying to load an RSS feed using Ajax. however, i'm getting an HTTP 302 response(resource has been moved).
[13:29:40] <supsup> but that should not matter maybe. since thats js doing it thats loaded.
[13:29:50] <Vordreller> Firebug shows that the new address is included in the Response Header
[13:29:57] <vpv4oo> yeah if i put the jsl.js on my server it works a bit better, but still doesnt seem to fully load
[13:30:00] <supsup> so u tried this jsfiddle example?
[13:30:05] <Vordreller> So my question is: how do I get that info with jquery?
[13:30:07] <supsup> i did on your server
[13:30:46] <vpv4oo> your last fiddle works, for sure
[13:31:01] <supsup> so then u can just copy that pattern no?
[13:31:05] <supsup> guess i'm missing something
[13:31:32] <supsup> you would of course need to flush out the map div everytime someone clicks as well.
[13:31:50] <vpv4oo> since you use the "manage resources" on the left to import the jsl.js, i could totally use that if i would put the jsl.js import in my <head>, but this is exactly what im trying to avoid
[13:32:14] <supsup> so as i asked earlier, is the .js file on your server?
[13:32:16] <BillCriswell> Dammit. IE is screwing with me.
[13:32:28] <supsup> just use google api pattern for adding the scr
[13:32:32] <supsup> before this
[13:32:37] <supsup> google analytic
[13:32:43] <vpv4oo> supsup: yes its on the server
[13:34:35] <vpv4oo> supsup: thanks for the help so far, reading through google analytics api for data export at the moment. i dont really know how it works
[13:34:45] <supsup> naw
[13:34:50] <studio> hi, i wanted to ask if there was any jquery'ish reason why this code wouldn't pop up the colorbox when the link is clicked the second time: http://pastebin.com/cMjTVL9Z
[13:34:53] <supsup> u know how google adds it's analtics to pages?
[13:35:00] <vpv4oo> supsup: no
[13:35:02] <supsup> it adds the script right by creating a script element etc
[13:35:59] <supsup> here i'll show u in jsfiddle.
[13:36:29] <supsup> just copy that idea http://jsfiddle.net/uX2Gq/
[13:38:24] <vpv4oo> thats kind of loading a script as if it was in <head> from the beginning afterwards?
[13:39:01] <BillCriswell> I wrote up this script. It seems to work well but in IE7 and IE8 it seems as though you can't mouse over the element unless you're on the border.
[13:39:06] <BillCriswell> http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/inspect/
[13:39:56] <BillCriswell> If I make the background color white it allows me to hover the whole area for whatever reason :-/
[13:41:53] <Dustyred> http://imgur.com/0lxiZ
[13:42:04] <studio> should i be returning false for this?
[13:42:28] <BillCriswell> It amazes me what people will spend time doing haha.
[13:43:28] <BillCriswell> studio: It should work just fine. Are you removing the link and recreating it by any chance?
[13:47:12] <supsup> vpv4oo not sure why it's not working on jsfiddle will take a look at it locally but yah about to have to roll out
[13:47:20] <studio> BillCriswell: no, not doing anything funky like that. just simply what you see
[13:49:24] <ZeuZ> each day that passes I find myself understanding just a bit of the titanic effort put onto jQuery...
[13:50:08] <imsky> ^^^
[13:50:11] <vpv4oo> supsup: did you mean like http://jsfiddle.net/HZfT6/ ?
[13:54:04] <supsup> like this (prob similar) http://jsfiddle.net/B9JKx/1/  -- i think it has to do with the script has callbacks inside of it
[13:54:11] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: i have an update on links inside a modal dialog ... if you bind something different to the links you get the behaviour one would want when clicking the link (if one wants the link to behave normally) ... the new improve line of code is this ...
[13:54:12] <pace_t_zulu|win> $('a', thisPopupMenu).on('click', function(e) { thisPopupMenu.dialog('close'); });
[13:54:14] <supsup> if you try to add it after it loads
[13:54:31] <pace_t_zulu|win> ... and that resolves the 'link in a modal dialog issue'
[13:54:41] <supsup> i don't think it's an issue out of the box
[13:54:45] <supsup> you did something to make it an issue
[13:54:50] <supsup> some other code or css
[13:54:58] <supsup> and now your just fixing that issue with more code
[13:55:02] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: its an issue if you use a modal dialog
[13:55:15] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: not when the dialog is not modal
[13:55:20] <supsup> maybe, i'll try...suprised i've never seen it.
[13:55:33] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: let me know if you see something different
[13:56:03] <pace_t_zulu|win> i prefer the following line because i want to eradicate the dialog from the DOM (its a complex page i'm working w)
[13:56:04] <pace_t_zulu|win> $('a', thisPopupMenu).on('click', function(e) { thisPopupMenu.dialog('close').dialog('destroy').remove(); });
[13:56:56] <ZeuZ> http://codepad.org/xqmkRln4 --> Issue is, when the enter key is pressed it finds the object (tried to alert it, and object Object was thrown out) but classes don't get swapped back.
[13:58:33] <yellowfish> is jquery feasible for live updates on a webapp?
[13:59:28] <ZeuZ> yellowfish, if you link against the latest in the site, I beleave it's feasible
[13:59:34] <studio> can anyone recommend a decent lightbox plugin please. colorbox seems to be giving bizarre issues
[14:00:07] <supsup> pace_t:http://jsfiddle.net/cKEVA/1/  -- can click it, just jsfiddle messes with link.
[14:00:12] <yellowfish> ZeuZ, so I'm trying to build this thing... were a bunch of people can upvote and downvote different questions in real time
[14:00:18] <yellowfish> would that be feasible in jquery?
[14:00:29] <BillCriswell> yellowfish: A very small part of it, yes.
[14:00:50] <yellowfish> BillCriswell, what do you mean? Will the jQuery be able to update content to every user?
[14:01:18] <ZeuZ> yellowfish, eh, yeah, like a refresh after certain time
[14:01:41] <ZeuZ> yellowfish, though most sites that do real-time use things like long polling and bayeux (facebook like chat)
[14:02:05] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: the dialog (and its contents) are being built dynamically when an icon is clicked on the page in my case
[14:02:39] <supsup> should not matter.
[14:02:40] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup:  what's the point of the         $( "#dialog:ui-dialog" ).dialog( "destroy" );            line?
[14:03:03] <supsup> i just copied this from jquerui example.  flush i assume
[14:03:09] <supsup> in case u run it more than once
[14:03:33] <pace_t_zulu|win> supsup: the dialog is also being inserted at the bottom of the <body> when its generated
[14:03:46] <supsup> should not matter
[14:03:50] <supsup> where you insert it
[14:04:01] <supsup> well as long as in body.
[14:09:09] <supsup> pace: http://jsfiddle.net/cKEVA/2/
[14:09:11] <supsup> still works
[14:09:23] <supsup> click 'my Icon'
[14:09:47] <supsup> anyway tho i gotta rollz
[14:11:03] <ZeuZ> shoky, ping
[14:37:28] <Carlitta87> is it possible that as soon as i finish typing a set of characters in a textbox, i can get the value ....but only after i stopped typing in it?
[14:38:18] <yellowfish> are there any simple code examples out there that show Server and Jquery communication?
[14:40:25] <t1m_> hey guys, i am looking for an event like change(), but it should be triggered when the user actually write the text while change is invoked when an element is loosing focus
[14:40:39] <t1m_> is there anything like that?
[14:41:30] <LessSeen> ? .ajax @ yellowfish

[15:01:29] <antnash_> Hey guys. I've got a table with some data in it, and a checkbox as the first column. Then I have a submit button, which when clicked I want to check that all selected rows have the same value for a certain column. Currently I have no idea how I would go about this, any hints?
[15:01:55] <someprimetime_> antnash_: look into looking $.each
[15:01:59] <someprimetime_> ? $.each ? antnash_
[15:02:00] <bot-t> someprimetime_, Couldn't find "$.each ? antnash_" in jQuery Docs.
[15:02:06] <someprimetime_> ? $.each @ antnash_
[15:02:07] <bot-t> antnash_, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:02:19] <someprimetime_> you'd look through each checkbox
[15:02:30] <someprimetime_> within your function you'd compare the value of $(this) which is the current checkbox
[15:02:48] <someprimetime_> to see if the val('checked', true)
[15:02:58] <antnash_> yeah, then do... $(this).closest('tr').children('td')[1] ?
[15:03:39] <antnash_> with a .val on the end, obviously?
[15:17:03] <antnash_> someprimetime_ can I use onsubmit='return confirm()' on a submit button rather than on the form itself?
[15:24:56] <LessSeen> antnash_: its just from the hip but i think if you want to add it to a button it would have to be like onclick="return confirm('really?') ? this.form.submit() : false"
[15:25:01] <PhonicUK> is there any way I can intercept changes to the DOM to prevent them from being made?
[15:25:40] <LessSeen> or something like that anyway..
[15:30:25] <shoky> ZeuZ, pong
[15:33:43] <raj> I have a form that I've selected and run .fileupload() on it (a method for a plugin). However, I've added an additional element within the form, and I need the .fileupload() method to recognize that. How might I do this?
[15:43:40] <antnash_> LessSeen: Got it working, ta
[15:44:28] <antnash_> Is this correct...  $.each($(":checkbox:checked"), function() { /*stuff*/ });
[15:45:12] <lenswipe> hey guys
[15:45:19] <lenswipe> anyone know why $(this).css('background-color', $(this).find('option:selected').css('background-color')); might not work in firefox?
[15:48:47] <xec> antnash_: i guess, but easier to just do $("selector").each(func..)
[15:49:00] <antnash_> cool. cheers xec
[15:49:32] <gasull> Hi.  How can I modify http://jsfiddle.net/pXx7q/ so it lets me type in the input text (doesn't work in FF)?
[15:50:17] <someprimetime_> antnash_: http://jsfiddle.net/gwjZa/
[15:50:41] <xec> gasull: move the input out of the radiobutton label
[15:51:17] <lenswipe> anyone?
[15:51:27] <lenswipe> $(this).css('background-color', $(this).find('option:selected').css('background-color')); doesnt work in firefox
[15:55:07] <gasull> xec: but then when I select the text input field, the radio button isn't checked
[15:56:05] <n00by> i have ul li and each li has 'li-index' element with a number. I'd like to sort <li>s according to the li-index attribute value
[15:56:21] <n00by> *element = atribute =)
[15:56:32] <gasull> xec: check the updated code in the link
[15:56:53] <shoky> lenswipe: fiddle
[15:57:02] <lenswipe> shoky, okay
[15:58:44] <xec> gasull: you will need to save and paste the new url
[15:58:52] <xec> gasull: but i made you this http://jsfiddle.net/pXx7q/7/
[16:00:23] <gasull> xec: thanks a lot
[16:00:32] <gasull> xec: that works
[16:00:52] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/erBBT/
[16:02:26] <antnash_> Right, well this isn't working at all in fiddle but it works on my set up. But you should get the idea of what I'm trying to do. http://jsfiddle.net/ayWke/
[16:02:41] <antnash_> What I actually get in the alert is a load of 'undefined'
[16:04:14] <lenswipe> shoky,
[16:04:18] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/erBBT/
[16:06:59] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/erBBT/2/
[16:09:28] <xec> lenswipe: that's quite interesting - at a glance it looks like firefox's user-agent "selected" background color overrides
[16:09:42] <foo> I have two sites, exact same code, but jquery works on one and not the other. Can anyone explain what would cause this? I'm going crazy.
[16:09:50] <antnash_> someprimetime_: http://jsfiddle.net/ayWke/ This is essetially what I'm trying to do. also, xec, any idea?
[16:10:17] <lenswipe> xec, hmm - it seems that the colour first set on the <select> overrides what im trying to do with jquery
[16:10:18] <lenswipe> jquery*
[16:10:21] <lenswipe> O_O
[16:10:43] <lenswipe> on second thoughts, it is the user agent one
[16:10:54] <xec> lenswipe: not quite, originally its white
[16:11:02] <lenswipe> yeah i know i just figured that :P
[16:11:06] <xec> :D
[16:11:33] <xec> antnash_: what am i looking at? what is the expected result?
[16:12:10] <antnash_> xec, the expected result is an alert box with 'II - II - II - ' if all checkboxes are selected
[16:12:22] <someprimetime_> damn looks like paul irish is gonna be @ google i/o instead of jquery con
[16:12:23] <someprimetime_> :\
[16:12:38] <someprimetime_> ajpiano: you going to be there?
[16:12:43] <antnash_> But what I actually get (on my system) is 'undefined - undefined - undefined - '
[16:12:50] <someprimetime_> my boss wants to know who's speaking first before he pays for my ticket i think
[16:12:56] <shoky> lenswipe: indeed that's odd. but it shouldn't really bother you much: http://jsfiddle.net/erBBT/3/
[16:13:03] <someprimetime_> since that determines if he wants to go as well
[16:13:41] <italianninja> hi wheres the best place to look for freelance work?
[16:15:10] <xec> italianninja: #css-lance is for most web stuff i believe
[16:15:30] <xec> antnash_: http://jsfiddle.net/ayWke/1/
[16:16:00] <mbhnyc> Hey all - quick question, working with a Rails app + devise + jQuery Mobile, and when I do a Facebook auth the only way I can get the button link to work is using rel: external.  Which is fine â€” but then when the return gets rendered, the Mobile Loading animation never clearsâ€¦I can see the form that should be rendered in the source, so it's come across, but jQM seems to be waiting for something that never occurs..
[16:16:03] <xec> hehe, it's still quite wrong
[16:16:14] <xec> but it won't show because thei're all "II"
[16:16:18] <xec> they're
[16:17:03] <mbhnyc> ..tried running hidePageLoadingMsg on the rendered page, but it has no effect.  Thanks in advance for any ideas. ;)
[16:17:18] <xec> antnash_: slightly better: http://jsfiddle.net/ayWke/2/
[16:19:08] <savid> When I set an event listener, eg,  $('a.something').on('click', function(){...}),   shouldn't that bind to that selector for elements added to the dom in the future?
[16:19:21] <shoky> savid: no
[16:19:44] <antnash_> xec: that's perfect, ta!
[16:20:20] <savid> shoky, hmm.  I knew how to do it with the old-style event functions, but not with the new-style.  Any idea how to make that work?
[16:20:47] <shoky> savid: you need to delegate the event handling to some container element that is already in the dom and stays in the dom
[16:20:59] <shoky> see ?on  about event delegation
[16:21:00] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:21:36] <savid> shoky, oh, I see.  I must have forgotten that.  Thanks.
[16:21:36] <shoky> savid: something like:  $( '#containerElement' ).on('click', 'a.something', function() {...} );
[16:22:28] <foo> I have the exact same code on on two sites, and I'm having a problem with Flash/jQuery - both client-side languages. I'm stumped. Anyone know any "gotchas" to why this might happen?
[16:22:41] <xec> antnash_: i'm having fun improving it! :) http://jsfiddle.net/ayWke/3/
[16:23:42] <antnash_> xec: haha! Well what I'm actually doing is adding each to an array and checking that every value is the same
[16:24:22] <xec> that sounds boring! i like the alert() much better
[16:25:59] <antnash_> hehe. Well I've gotta check that each selected row is of the same type before a form is submitted, and if it's not then the submission is cancelled
[16:28:33] <foo> anyone used shadowbox? haven't some very strange problems.
[16:28:43] <xec> ?anyone
[16:28:43] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[16:29:49] <foo> xec: I have two pages with the exact same code: on one of them, shadowbox works, on the other, it does not. I'm absolutely stumped.
[16:30:01] <xec> are they both live?
[16:30:04] <foo> xec: yes
[16:30:15] <xec> urls please! :D
[16:30:38] <foo> xec: http://www.childrensmuseums.org/index.php/strategic-framework.html and http://x03.ath.cx/moire/flash.html
[16:30:57] <foo> xec: click : Click here to view our Flash video. - on x03 page, it works, on childrensmuseums, it does not
[16:31:30] <xec> click where?
[16:31:36] <foo> xec: the text "Click here to view our Flash video."
[16:31:40] <foo> xec: (right hand side)
[16:31:44] <xec> ah right
[16:32:16] <xec> both seem to work fine here (ff), what browser are you on?
[16:32:31] <foo> xec: interesting. chrome
[16:32:36] <foo> now I'm curious. *opens firefox
[16:32:40] <blindMoe> in chrome it only works on the x03 page
[16:32:48] <foo> blindMoe: ok, something really weird is going on
[16:32:49] <blindMoe> doesn't open in a lightbox on the childrensmuseums page
[16:32:55] <foo> xec: I didn't even think about opening in another browser!
[16:33:21] <blindMoe> hrmm that time it worked in chrome on child rems museums as well!
[16:33:28] <blindMoe> lot of 404's for the lightbox elements though
[16:33:31] <xec> i don't see a difference in chrome either
[16:33:45] <foo> thanks guys, really appreciate the help. I've been banging my head against the wall on this one
[16:33:56] <foo> blindMoe: where do you see that? I didn't see anything in chrome error console
[16:34:02] <blindMoe> click the link
[16:35:05] <foo> blindMo / xec - I think part of the problem is shadowbox is taking a while to load, and I think by the time I click on the URL, shadowbox hasn't loaded yet sometimes (is that possible? )
[16:36:58] <xec> i think you're on to something. if i refresh and click the link immediately i get the flash in fullscreen
[16:37:03] <foo> yes, same here xec
[16:37:08] <foo> is that normal with jquery?
[16:37:11] <foo> or is this host just really slow?
[16:38:00] <xec> where is the code that enables the shadowboxing
[16:38:02] <lenswipe> thanks shoky btw
[16:38:18] <foo> xec: let me pastebin
[16:38:26] <foo> xec: it's at the end of </head> actually
[16:38:32] <foo> xec: I wonder if that should be put at the top of <head>
[16:38:43] <foo> xec: well, I mean, it's the last thing before closing </head>
[16:39:01] <xec> whoa it's made by michael jackson
[16:39:06] <foo> haha
[16:39:10] <piklu> paul irish has changed his nick or he is no longer here these days?
[16:39:15] <foo> xec: actually, I think that's what it is. it has to be that
[16:39:16] <antnash_> xec: Cheers dude, got it working exactly as  wanted.
[16:39:30] <xec> piklu: i saw him earlier
[16:39:46] <piklu> he used to be hero. he he
[16:40:06] <xec> no hero no more? :(
[16:40:25] <piklu> xec: is he?
[16:41:05] <foo> xec: can you confirm that that might be the only fix at the moment?
[16:41:08] <xec> what? you just said he used to be "hero"
[16:41:13] <foo> xec: and then I can put the ball back in the devs court :)
[16:42:01] <piklu> xec? ya i did
[16:42:16] <antnash_> xec: Can you see any improvement to this: http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/
[16:42:18] <piklu> foo:bar
[16:42:24] <piklu> bar:foo
[16:42:32] <xec> piklu: i assumed you meant "here" and made a silly joke :P
[16:42:57] <piklu> xec: actually i respect him a lot :)
[16:43:49] <xec> foo: there's too much page to just pinpoint exactly what's going on, but the "doesnt work immediately" thing should be a good hint to whoever made it
[16:44:09] <xec> pinpoint easily*
[16:44:25] <xec> i.e. i'm not gonna spend much time debugging it ;)
[16:44:27] <foo> xec: I'm trying to get it to work. Is it possible that the server is so slow that the jquery stuff should be at the top of <head> instead of at the end?
[16:44:41] <foo> xec: that's cool :) I think you saying it worked in firefox was a big help
[16:45:36] <xec> foo: i get the same error in firefox if i refresh and click quickly ;)
[16:45:54] <xec> foo: but it's not gonna make a difference *where in head* the script is
[16:46:15] <xec> as long as dependencies are loaded first, which they obviously are
[16:46:24] <xec> something else is causing the delay
[16:47:12] <antnash_> xec: What I actually meant was this http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/1/
[16:48:05] <foo> xec: aha! interesting, ok
[16:48:17] <foo> xec: well, that's great to know that it doesn't matter where it is in <head>
[16:48:19] <xec> antnash_: you're looping the same data twice, essentially
[16:48:38] <antnash_> You're right
[16:48:41] <antnash_> hold on
[16:48:41] <foo> xec: I'll use chrome network debugging to see what's taking the most time to load
[16:48:42] <xec> so i'm sure it can be improved
[16:48:45] <antnash_> I can fix that
[16:49:07] <xec> but you're unlikely to ever notice a difference in performance from this
[16:49:26] <xec> so if it does what you want, i'd say leave it
[16:50:09] <foo> xec: the problem is if someone clicks the link quickly
[16:50:39] <antnash_> xec: there http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/2/
[16:51:47] <foo> xec: do you have any tips for debugging this further? or would the network tool in chrome web inspector be it?
[16:52:16] <xec> foo: that's a good start at least, also look at the 404's perhaps
[16:52:28] <foo> xec: oh, where are those 404s?
[16:52:37] <xec> antnash_: yeah that looks quite elegant
[16:52:46] <antnash_> xec: Cheers bud :)
[16:53:33] <xec> foo: i see them in console when i click the link, like blindMoe pointed out
[16:54:05] <foo> xec: AHH! I missed what he said. Ok, awesome, thanks. I can fix that
[16:55:07] <xec> i doubt they are what's causing it, but doesn't hurt fixing anyway ;)
[16:59:11] <foo> xec: yeah, fixed that, same problem exists. I'm not sure what else to do
[16:59:11] <foo> hm
[17:00:37] <xec> almost falling asleep here (2am), gonna head to bed
[17:00:54] <xec> happy debugging and good luck, you're gonna need it xD
[17:01:26] <foo> xec: thanks :)
[17:01:31] <foo> blindMoe: Still around?
[17:07:41] <foo> I have these two pages: http://www.childrensmuseums.org/index.php/strategic-framework.html  and http://x03.ath.cx/moire/flash.html
[17:08:22] <foo> On x03, click on "Click here to view our Flash video" - you'll notice it loads quickly. On the other page, click that right away, and you'll see it opens the SWF in a new window and not shadowbox. Both pages have the exact same code. Any thoughts on this?
[17:21:37] <antnash_> xec: Right, I'm trying to expand on what I've done. The expansion works, but I've broken the original check. http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/3/
[17:26:25] <shoky> antnash_ you know that with that .each()  on the td's you're also getting the checkbox cell
[17:26:37] <otherj> does anyone know bootstrap/typeahead to help me with that? it uses jquery, and i'm hoping to modify the results it drops down to make them links to the results
[17:26:51] <antnash_> shoky: Yeah, I've accounted for that
[17:27:21] <antnash_> shoky: For some reason it works if I only select 2 boxes, but fails if any more.
[17:28:38] <shoky> antnash_ you only put 2 sub-arrays in rows
[17:28:58] <shoky> instead of 4 (at least)
[17:29:32] <shoky> so when more than 2 are checked, you're getting an error trying to access rows[2][0]
[17:29:36] <shoky> when rows[2] is undefined
[17:29:42] <antnash_> Surely I only need 2. The first dimension is the row, the second dimension is the cell text
[17:29:51] <shoky> only 2 dimensions, yes
[17:29:59] <shoky> but you have 4 rows
[17:30:04] <shoky> (4 checkboxes..)
[17:30:16] <shoky> what i mean is:
[17:30:19] <antnash_> But I'll have an undetermined number of checkboxes in my actual app
[17:30:19] <shoky> var rows = [[],[],[],[]];
[17:30:27] <shoky> then you should build your array dynamically
[17:30:32] <shoky> and not initialize it like that
[17:30:44] <shoky> rows.push( newrow )
[17:30:57] <shoky> sec
[17:31:52] <shoky> this is better: http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/4/
[17:32:16] <shoky> but you should think if you really want to fiddle with all those x,y indexes
[17:32:55] <shoky> oops
[17:33:14] <shoky> i meant this: v
[17:33:16] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/5/
[17:34:45] <antnash_> I've got why it's failing now. Just had to write it out. Dude, that's perfect. Ta
[17:35:09] <antnash_> I'm gonna think it over more tomorrow when I haven't had almost half a bottle of vodka
[17:36:19] <shoky> sec
[17:36:25] <antnash_> He says, pouring himself another
[17:37:57] <shoky> check it: http://jsfiddle.net/vwm86/6/
[17:38:02] <shoky> no need for sloppy indexes
[17:39:11] <shoky> well then i'll smoke my spliff
[17:39:44] <antnash_> lol. Gave that up years ago. Sent me a bit mental after I smoked too much
[17:40:10] <antnash_> Question. what's the firstCompany = firstCompany || row[1]; doing?
[17:40:36] <shoky> if firstCompany is already defined, then it doesn't do anything (sets firstCOmpany to itself)
[17:40:43] <shoky> if its undefined, it sets it to row[1]
[17:40:49] <antnash_> Ah! excellent!
[17:40:55] <shoky> ;p
[17:41:09] <antnash_> This is some good learnin'
[17:41:30] <shoky> if the company can have a value such as 0 then you might need to change that line a bit
[17:41:41] <shoky> cause 0 evaluates to false
[17:41:46] <antnash_> The company will always have a value
[17:41:53] <shoky> 0 is a value ;p
[17:42:12] <antnash_> didn't read the 0 -> false bit
[17:42:25] <antnash_> But no, company will never be 0
[17:42:33] <shoky> if (0) { this wont run }
[17:42:55] <chilversc_> yeah, never like weak typing, that just annoys me having to worry about "0" == 0 == false type things
[17:43:50] <caoque> I have an input with the name="abc[0].def[0]" but when I try to use a selector ":input[name='abc[0].def[0]']" I find no objects. Why?
[17:44:01] <chilversc_> which gets even wierder when "0" == false but if("0") counts as true :s
[17:44:59] <antnash_> I take your point, chilversc_, but it can make other situations slightly easier
[17:45:10] <caoque> can someone help me please?
[17:45:26] <chilversc_> antnash_: such as? and are those situations really worth the extra problems it causes?
[17:45:29] <antnash_> Please don't ask me to name one. I'm x vodkas down
[17:46:00] <antnash_> And I've gotta wake up in 5 hours to go to work
[17:46:00] <chilversc_> caoque: no idea, jsfiddle?
[17:46:19] <antnash_> But it'd be rude not to finish the bottle when I'm so close
[17:47:07] <caoque> no
[17:47:16] <shoky> caoque: this works $(':input').filter('[name="abc[0].def[0]"]')
[17:47:37] <caoque> I'll try
[17:47:42] <shoky> the other way around is probably better
[17:48:06] <shoky> also just "input[name='abc[0].def[0]']"   works
[17:48:35] <caoque> yeah ... filter works
[17:48:59] <chilversc> I was pondering something like $(":input", document.getElementByName("abc[0].def[0]"))
[17:49:05] <shoky> o_O
[17:49:23] <caoque> but why the selector :input[name="abc[0].def[0]"] not work?
[17:50:00] <caoque> Why do I need to use "filter"?
[17:50:27] <shoky> why not "input[name='abc[0].def[0]']" ?
[17:51:36] <caoque> Yeah... the selector ":input[name='abc[0].def[0]']" returns nothing
[17:51:50] <shoky> yeah, remove the colon :
[17:53:04] <caoque> yeah... without the colon the selector works
[17:53:10] <shoky> the problem is the dot .
[17:53:19] <shoky> if you didnt have a dot there it seems to work fine either way
[17:53:42] <caoque> Is it a bug?
[17:53:47] <shoky> no idea
[17:54:01] <chilversc> caoque: seems to be a problem with the :input pseudo selector, or maybe just pseudo selectors in general
[17:54:22] <caoque> Yeah... I see...
[17:54:36] <caoque> Thank you everybody...
[17:54:54] <shoky> np good luck with your weirdly named inputs
[17:55:06] <caoque> uheuheuhe
[17:56:14] <chilversc> shoky: not that weirdly named, I've seen it as a common naming pattern for php and asp.net
[17:56:35] <chilversc> the alternative being abc.0.def.0
[17:56:50] <shoky> then php and asp.net have weird names for their inputs
[17:57:01] <shoky> i didnt say its uncommon ;P
[17:59:50] <systemfault> Why the hell would you select by name?
[18:00:17] <systemfault> Don't rely on the "name" attributeâ€¦ you're using that as a "link" to the backend.
[18:00:29] <systemfault> It might change in the future..
[18:00:45] <systemfault> Just add a class or an id.
[18:01:48] <chilversc> systemfault: depends what your after, eg finding a selected item in a list of checkboxes, name might make sense
[18:03:51] <chilversc> also, name doesn't have to be unique, which can also be nice when looking for a specific element within a container
[18:04:09] <systemfault> classes are not unique either.
[18:04:10] <chilversc> just a shame only inputs support name, end up needing to do something like data-name attributes
[18:04:37] <chilversc> yeah, or just abuse the class attribute for something it wasn't ment to be used for
[18:04:55] <systemfault> Classes should be used to enhance the HTML semantic.
[18:05:11] <systemfault> That's exactly the idea with inputs.
[18:05:27] <systemfault> <input type="text" class="first-name" name="firstName">
[18:08:20] <mbhnyc> Hey all, thought I'd post this jQMobile q again â€” on an OAuth form, connect to facebook button works great using rel: external, but then when the return gets rendered the Loading animation never clears, even though I can see the form elements for the next step in the source, so it's there.. I think it has something to do with how rails is rendering the callbacks, but no idea how to address
[18:08:31] <mbhnyc> done lots of fiddling with no affect :)
[18:31:21] <Dr-Bombay> "Programming HTML5 Applications" from O'Reilly: a bad book
[18:31:43] <systemfault> All books from oreilly are bad books..
[18:31:57] <systemfault> Addison-Wesley forever.
[18:32:29] <systemfault> (There's a few small edition company that I do like though...)
[18:33:00] <gkShift> Since we are on the subject of books to learn, recomment a JQuery book for me? Beginners?
[18:33:19] <gkShift> I've been using internet tutorials pulled from here and there, nothing cohesive.
[18:33:22] <shoky> o'reilly books on perl are the best
[18:33:27] <shoky> ask RandalSchwartz
[18:33:34] <systemfault> gkShift: Unfortunately, there's no good book on jQuery.
[18:33:39] <otherj> why learn from a jqury book? just learn javascript
[18:33:42] <otherj> then jquery is no problem
[18:33:52] <otherj> javascript: the good parts
[18:33:52] <systemfault> gkShift: The main reason being that jQuery evolves too quickly..
[18:34:03] <gkShift> Know basics in Javascript. I suppose that will suffice me?
[18:35:26] <systemfault> gkShift: Wellâ€¦ depends on what "basics" means :(
[18:37:16] <Dr-Bombay> "basics" can be anything
[18:38:07] <Dr-Bombay> I would consider closures to be basic for js, even though they're not in a lot of other languages (because they don't exist or aren't used effectively)
[18:38:17] <shoky> gkShift i'll quote gnarf:
[18:38:19] <shoky> ?101
[18:38:20] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[18:38:21] <shoky> ?learn
[18:38:21] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[18:38:30] <systemfault> closure is definitely part of the basics.
[18:39:26] <gnarf> eloquent is AMAZING
[18:39:28] <gnarf> <3
[18:43:14] <shoky> i didn't like it much myself
[18:50:15] <BG> does jQuery.animate() use CSS3 transitions if the browser supports them, or should I use an external plugin, such as jquery.transit?
[18:52:13] <shoky> it doesn't use them afaik
[18:52:52] <BG> thanks shoky
[18:56:59] <antnash_> shoky: What js study materials would you recommend for learning on the go?
[18:57:22] <antnash_> ie, videos/ebooks I can stick on my tablet
[18:58:27] <shoky> those 3 links have lots of content
[18:58:57] <N3WB13> Hi is anyone here familiar with PayPal IPN?
[18:59:05] <antnash_> Anything for a tablet without 3g?
[18:59:19] <shoky> you can download them
[18:59:40] <antnash_> Aha!
[18:59:42] <antnash_> Wonderful!
[18:59:58] <shoky> http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent%20JavaScript.zip
[19:00:45] <shoky> well donno about MDN
[19:01:07] <antnash_> Wow. that mozilla link has a LOT of material
[19:03:08] <shoky> this is a good read for understanding js events: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[19:03:46] <antnash_> shoky: A good programme for when you're stoned, QI
[19:04:18] <shoky> i've seen it before
[19:04:24] <shoky> barely remember anything ;P
[19:04:55] <shoky> thanx
[19:04:56] <antnash_> lol. Almost all of my random knowledge comes from there
[19:05:01] <antnash_> Where you from?
[19:05:10] <shoky> israel
[19:05:15] <shoky> you?
[19:05:18] <antnash_> London
[19:05:23] <shoky> sweet
[19:05:42] <antnash_> It is. London rocks
[19:05:57] <antnash_> Never been to Israel. Would love to
[19:06:03] <shoky> been there as a kid. didn't like it much then ;P
[19:06:27] <antnash_> It's awesome if you're 18 to 30
[19:06:38] <antnash_> probably older too, but I'm yet to find that out
[19:06:39] <shoky> ya i was maybe 14
[19:07:03] <antnash_> Yeah, not particularly interested in the culture stuff, and too young to go out on the town
[19:07:04] <antnash_> No good
[19:07:12] <shoky> aye
[19:07:37] <antnash_> But when you are old enough to hit the town, just too good
[19:08:16] <antnash_> Huge Jewish community too (making an assumption)
[19:08:47] <shoky> i'm jewish.. or smth
[19:08:52] <antnash_> lol
[19:09:02] <shoky> i couldn't care less about jewish communities though ;P
[19:09:06] <antnash_> Not frum then
[19:09:16] <shoky> far from it
[19:09:34] <antnash_> Never had 'the calling'?
[19:09:59] <shoky> they called me in the street and i ignored them, sure ;P
[19:10:28] <antnash_> My ex's brother was massively far from frum and then all of a sudden he got hooked
[19:10:30] <shoky> but yes. i'm quite secular
[19:10:44] <shoky> yeah they do that
[19:11:04] <antnash_> I've never really had any form of religion in my life at all
[19:11:10] <ZeuZ> shoky, followed your advice, it's currently working
[19:11:20] <shoky> ZeuZ i just ponged you
[19:11:25] <shoky> how is that advice !
[19:11:42] <antnash_> Only been to church for weddings, funerals and school carol services
[19:11:42] <ZeuZ> shoky, oh, sorry :P I just happen to pop the client and saw you
[19:11:51] <ZeuZ> shoky, having one div visible, the other not.
[19:11:54] <shoky> ah
[19:11:59] <shoky> good ;P
[19:12:16] <antnash_> Don't really see the point in religion
[19:12:21] <shoky> antnash_ i simply cant remember the last time i was in a synagogue
[19:12:33] <ZeuZ> shoky, now the thing is, I attached a keypress event so that "enter" will make the things swap back
[19:12:48] <antnash_> It just sorta seems another excuse for war to me.
[19:12:51] <ZeuZ> but.. even if I do find the item, it doesn't switch it back :P
[19:12:57] <ZeuZ> Working proof:
[19:13:08] <antnash_> war and exclusion.
[19:13:19] <shoky> mankind will always find excuses for war
[19:13:32] <ZeuZ> shoky, 190.16.86.49 test:test click "Inventario", then click any td
[19:13:34] <antnash_> As southpark has told us
[19:13:43] <shoky> has it
[19:14:57] <antnash_> There was an episode which was based in the future where atheism was the only religion, and various groups had different names for their groups. Still war.
[19:14:59] <shoky> ZeuZ yea enter isn't doing anything
[19:15:27] <antnash_> Love south park. It's grown up with its viewers. Used to be just toilet humour, and now it's all satire.
[19:15:35] <ZeuZ> shoky, check the source on /script.js
[19:15:42] <shoky> i got tired of southpark long ago
[19:15:52] <ZeuZ> shoky, I don't really understand WHY it isn't working
[19:16:00] <ZeuZ> as when I check with find, it is finding some object
[19:16:15] <shoky> ZeuZ ok, if you promise to fiddle it next time
[19:16:58] <ZeuZ> shoky, you got it :P
[19:17:06] <shoky> ZeuZ: 'this' is the input element
[19:17:20] <shoky> that had the enter pressed in it
[19:17:31] <shoky> and you are looking for child elements of that input
[19:17:32] <shoky> ?
[19:17:40] <ZeuZ> actually, parent
[19:17:46] <shoky> $(this).find(".activo,.inactivo")
[19:17:47] <ZeuZ> but find doesn't transverse it?
[19:17:51] <shoky> ?find
[19:17:52] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:18:28] <ZeuZ> oh wait got it
[19:18:37] <ZeuZ> first I've gotta move to parent and then find it
[19:18:51] <shoky> gogogo
[19:21:57] <ZeuZ> shoky, hmm'k (South-park style yeah) done with that hehe
[19:22:21] <shoky> drugz r bad mk
[19:22:25] <antnash_> gotta love the sp
[19:22:53] <antnash_> Also, Californication and Breaking Bad
[19:33:25] <ZeuZ> shoky, oh, found out something disturbing about how I'm managing this..
[19:33:56] <ZeuZ> upon enter, it'll swap classes back, but.. I can never click that td again for it to show the td with the <input> since it's getting overwritten
[19:34:40] <ZeuZ> shoky, ideas?
[19:52:16] <shoky> the td is getting overwritten?
[19:53:26] <shoky> ZeuZ its because of: if ($(this).data('clicked')) return;
[19:53:29] <shoky> i think
[19:53:35] <shoky> what're you trying to do with that...
[19:55:23] <shoky> btw: $('[id="menu"]')   -->  $('#menu')
[19:55:54] <ZeuZ> the td is getting overwritten though
[19:56:04] <ZeuZ> just checked it with firebug
[19:56:18] <shoky> why would the td get overwritten
[19:56:44] <shoky> you're just switching classes of the divs inside
[19:56:44] <ZeuZ> dunno, but uppon switching the class from activo to inactivo the <input> inside the item is erased
[19:57:00] <shoky> oh
[19:57:02] <ZeuZ> yeah but the items holded in those divs dissapear
[19:57:09] <shoky> that's because of this:  $(this).parent().parent().find(".activo,.inactivo").text($(this).val());
[19:57:21] <shoky> you're setting BOTH divs there
[19:57:42] <ZeuZ> I should .find() it first?
[19:57:58] <shoky> you shouldn't include both classes in the selector
[19:58:37] <shoky> just the inactivo i think
[19:59:18] <ZeuZ> nope
[19:59:27] <ZeuZ> tried changing both, I mean, one, or the other
[19:59:31] <ZeuZ> but still has the same
[19:59:49] <shoky> no now its fine
[19:59:53] <shoky> leave it with inactivo
[20:00:08] <shoky> now you just need to take care of: if ($(this).data('clicked')) return;
[20:01:04] <ZeuZ> but firebug shows as after the enter, the div inactivo is input-less
[20:01:35] <shoky> im using chrome
[20:01:37] <ZeuZ> I think the problem comes from before, $(this).find(".activo,.inactivo").toggleClass("activo inactivo");
[20:01:39] <shoky> and the input is still there
[20:01:51] <shoky> no that's fine
[20:02:12] <ZeuZ> shouldn't I tag just .activo and toggleClass('inactivo')?
[20:02:37] <shoky> and in firebug its fine too man
[20:02:52] <shoky> why?'
[20:02:52] <ZeuZ> then my browser is playing tricks with my mind ?
[20:02:55] <shoky> yes
[20:03:01] <shoky> or you didnt reload ;0
[20:03:02] <shoky> ;)
[20:03:03] <ZeuZ> yes to what question?
[20:03:07] <shoky> playing tricks
[20:03:54] <Guest87197> hey all, sorry if i'mm slow on the chat protocol, new to IRC.  any one have any wisdom on single quotes and ajax POST calls ?  the single quotes are killing me
[20:04:05] <ZeuZ> shoky, CTRL+F5
[20:04:12] <ZeuZ> shoky, just worked it out though  :P
[20:04:24] <ZeuZ> .parent().parent().data('clicked',false);
[20:04:34] <shoky> yes ^
[20:06:59] <Guest87197> any ajax heads?
[20:08:13] <Guest87197> maybe tomorrow
[20:31:31] <abjorn> I need a drinking buddy, WHO'S UP FOR IT?
[20:32:18] <djMax> I have a clear button (div) on a text input. When I click the x the text box loses focus. Any way to stop this?
[20:34:49] <xiam> abjorn: go on
[20:35:11] <abjorn> I have most of a bottle of rum and all my friends are dumb
[20:36:12] <xiam> abjorn: drink 'till you can't write correctly anymore!
[20:36:27] <abjorn> it's bound to happen
[20:37:48] <xiam> abjorn: open a text editor, drink and search for Ballmer's peak.
[20:37:54] <shoky> djMax: what
[20:38:02] <abjorn> I've tried that
[20:38:05] <abjorn> I was unsuccessful
[20:38:14] <abjorn> Also I'm drinking shitty cheap rum so I don't think it's going to happen
[20:38:27] <xiam> try again, you may be able to fix the jquery plugin site!
[20:38:42] <abjorn> can't make it any worse, right?
[20:39:56] <xiam> abjorn: well, you know your head will hurt tomorrow, but it's still sane, isn't it?
[20:40:44] <xiam> use your head while is fine, cheap rum won't do any good for you!
[20:41:11] <abjorn> any rum never does any good
[20:41:42] <abjorn> god that tastes awful
[20:44:29] <wodemaye__> If anyone sees Whirl3d around tonight, can they please check if he's gotten my PMs?  I don't know why he wouldn't, he just might not notice them if he's afk at the exact time that they're sent depending on how his client is configured.  Anyone who plans to stay on for a significant chunk of the night, would you mind just giving me a nod of some sort so I know someone's seen this at least before i go to bed? thanks.
[20:49:00] <shoky> K
[20:49:36] <wodemaye__> shoky, that at me?
[20:49:44] <shoky> yes
[20:49:58] <wodemaye__> shoky, awesome, u da man. :)  cya later.
[20:50:04] <shoky> by
[20:50:06] <djMax> So the issue may be just a mobile one, but I lose focus on a text field when I click the div I put next to it to clear it.
[20:50:17] <djMax> I suppose it makes perfect sense, just not sure how to get around it
[20:52:57] <djMax> does val() return the element(s) that were set, such that I can call focus() on it?
[20:54:30] <shoky> uhm
[20:54:40] <shoky> so give it back the focus..
[20:54:57] <shoky> val() returns the value of what it was called on
[20:55:25] <djMax> so $("#foo").val(x).focus() makes sense
[20:55:45] <shoky> yes
[20:56:08] <shoky> most of those jquery methods such as val  can be chained
[20:57:08] <shoky> there's val() which returns the value, and there's val( valueToSet ) which sets the value and returns the jq obj so you can chain
[20:57:12] <oojacoboo> is there a way to find out what request a form is making over an ajax call through an inspector?
[20:57:36] <oojacoboo> I find myself constantly referencing my js files, searching for ID's etc
[20:57:36] <shoky> chrome shows me all the requests
[20:57:40] <oojacoboo> it's a real PITA
[20:58:15] <oojacoboo> shoky: where?
[20:58:38] <shoky> in the console you can right click and check 'log xhr'
[20:58:50] <shoky> and the network tab shows all requests
[20:58:52] <shoky> in detail
[20:59:53] <coldhead> plus you can filter by xhr or css or what have you
[21:00:11] <oojacoboo> yea, I see that, it doesn't appear to be updating
[21:00:27] <oojacoboo> oh wait, it does, bottom down
[21:00:44] <oojacoboo> nice, thanks guys
[21:01:24] <oojacoboo> yea, that'll be a huge time saver, was getting sick of looking it up in the js
[21:02:01] <shoky> ;-------->
[21:02:34] <oojacoboo> pinochio?
[21:02:47] <shoky> u wish
[21:03:40] <oojacoboo> I do?
[21:03:49] <shoky> ye, think bout it ... .
[21:04:09] <oojacoboo> I did, and it didn't make much sense
[21:04:22] <shoky> ok you must be sober then
[21:04:29] <oojacoboo> correct
[21:04:35] <shoky> yeap!
[21:04:59] <oojacoboo> and you must be batting for the wrong team :P
[21:05:21] <shoky> i beg your pardon
[21:05:49] <oojacoboo> since you beggedâ€¦ pardon me
[21:06:12] <coldhead> look, it's all going to be okay
[21:06:12] <shoky> cheers
[21:07:14] <abjorn> coldhead: I'm going to find ballmer's peak tonight.
[21:07:25] <abjorn> That's assuming this rum hasn't already put me past it
[21:08:13] <coldhead> its a knife edge
[21:08:16] <coldhead> good luck abjorn
[21:08:19] <coldhead> small sips

[21:12:14] <someprimetime> K
[21:12:15] <abjorn> I am not too drunk to help
[21:12:17] <lenswipe> i have a form containing a tree of divs
[21:12:28] <lenswipe> .children() returns the immediate children of the form
[21:12:41] <lenswipe> however my form elements are in containing divs
[21:12:50] <lenswipe> i want to check the whole DOM tree inside the form for the class required
[21:12:50] <abjorn> ?find @ lenswipe
[21:12:51] <bot-t> lenswipe, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[21:12:57] <abjorn> bam
[21:12:57] <lenswipe> ok ty
[21:12:59] <abjorn> np
[21:13:00] <someprimetime> $('form').find('whatever');
[21:13:05] <abjorn> BACK TO THE DRINKING
[21:13:08] <mbhnyc> haha
[21:13:08] <someprimetime> find is the same as children and all those other aliases
[21:13:12] <mbhnyc> mmm bourbon..
[21:13:13] <someprimetime> (pretty much)
[21:13:21] <abjorn> im having a rum and coke
[21:13:24] <abjorn> after a few shots of rum
[21:13:26] <someprimetime> i'm drinking a great white
[21:13:27] <abjorn> this rum is shiiiiiit
[21:13:34] <someprimetime> what are you 17 years old
[21:13:43] <someprimetime> you going to make a vodka spritzer next?
[21:13:50] <abjorn> yes
[21:13:52] <abjorn> except no
[21:13:53] <mbhnyc> rum makes me feel like i'm on the beach
[21:13:56] <abjorn> lol
[21:14:00] <mbhnyc> which is pretty much the only place i drink it
[21:14:01] <abjorn> this rum doesn't, because it's awful
[21:14:26] <abjorn> My sister bought some shitty $8 bottle of rum for jello shots and left about half of it. I am tasked with finishing it off.
[21:14:36] <abjorn> And by tasked I mean I said "I'll finish that off" and she didn't care
[21:14:41] <mbhnyc> rum = i don't care if you get me sick 'cause i have sunstroke and don't care
[21:14:54] <abjorn> lol
[21:15:09] <mbhnyc> can i just ship you all of the rum i don't drink?  simpler
[21:15:47] <mbhnyc> while i'm at it - @abjorn any experience with jQuery Mobile?  i'm stuck on something..
[21:16:00] <abjorn> someprimetime: to be fair, this rum and coke is after 4 or 5 shots of rum. And some of this fine johnnie walker black label
[21:16:02] <abjorn> nope
[21:16:30] <mbhnyc> blast.
[21:16:33] <mbhnyc> thanks anyway
[21:16:42] <mbhnyc> back to your regularly scheduled bourbon
[21:16:43] <someprimetime> i'm not a scotch man
[21:16:52] <abjorn> I am on occasion
[21:16:58] <abjorn> Which is why this black label has lasted...quite awhile
[21:18:31] <coldhead> i've taken to cognac
[21:18:37] <coldhead> it doesn't judge me
[21:18:38] <abjorn> never had that
[21:18:39] <abjorn> lol
[21:18:44] <abjorn> its okay
[21:18:47] <abjorn> i judge you in its place
[21:18:56] <coldhead> yes, it gets out of your way
[21:18:59] <coldhead> to let you do that
[21:19:17] <abjorn> ive never had brandy in general
[21:19:40] <abjorn> not a fan of wine
[21:19:58] <abjorn> or anything thats like it
[21:20:35] <abjorn> SO WHO ELSE NEEDS JQUERY HELP
[21:21:40] <coldhead> cognac is different to brandy
[21:21:44] <coldhead> its not too sweet
[21:21:54] <abjorn> werd
[21:22:13] <coldhead> its more like a scotch that doesn't leave you like a kitten crushed under a train
[21:22:24] <coldhead> and for this reason i nominate it Breakfast Of Champions
[21:22:30] <abjorn> rofl
[21:22:35] <abjorn> scotch does tend to do that
[21:22:43] <coldhead> scotch is not a breakfast drink
[21:22:48] <coldhead> it destroys afternoons that way
[21:23:22] <abjorn> it destroys a lot more than afternoons
[21:23:31] <abjorn> for instance: marriages
[21:23:39] <coldhead> lololol

[23:39:20] <zzzrod> night all, is there any incompatibility with outerHeight() in webkit? It always returns a different value from other browsers
[23:41:02] <coldhead> zzzrod: perhaps webkit is using a different box-sizing to the other browsers?
[23:51:12] <Steve___> gfhfg
[23:52:09] <Steve___> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[23:52:40] <systemfault> Oh really?
[23:54:06] <LukeNukem> document.getElementById('my_form').target = 'my_iframe';
[23:54:10] <LukeNukem> whats the alternative to that in jquery?
[23:55:30] <gnarf> $("#my_form").prop( "target", "my_iframe" )
[23:57:58] <LukeNukem> ok
