[00:14:41] <sigurding> guys I have a weird behavior in IE9. I created a context menu, which does not seem to work, but when I open the Developer tools, it starts working
[00:15:15] <Cork> check if you're using console.* in you're code
[00:15:33] <sigurding> Cork: yep I do
[00:15:36] <Cork> i think ie9 defines that only if the debug console is open
[00:15:43] <Cork> else its undefined
[00:16:05] <Cork> rather ie8 and 9 does
[00:16:12] <Cork> ie7< doesn't ever define it
[00:16:15] <sigurding> you are right
[00:16:20] <sigurding> thanks guys
[00:18:01] <benjick> So I'm looking at http://personbilar.volkswagen.se/sv/models/eos/highlights.html - the white blobs that you can mouseover, i want to replicate these. Would it be possible with slideup?
[00:18:44] <Cork> no you would prob have to use animate
[00:18:54] <Cork> as it has to change its top/left position too
[00:19:05] <Cork> ?.animate
[00:19:06] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:21:36] <benjick> Cork: thank you
[00:24:25] <hassan> jquery tablesorter header clicks don't work in chrome. when debugging, 4 errors are shown which are all related to WebsiteLogonOTP.js...  can't make any sense of them
[00:24:50] <phonebook_> screenshot?
[00:25:48] <hassan> sure, sec please.
[00:28:35] <devOlsen> Got sick of not being able to have both custom marker images as well as custom text (like a markers count) using google maps and or google charts. So I made this php gd file to accepts remote png images, custom text, font types, size position and color to render true custom markers. http://tinyurl.com/aclrkn2 bookmark if you find useful.
[00:30:33] <phonebook_> screenshot?

[00:40:37] <rootcoma> I am trying to do a head request to make sure images are the correct content-type, and size.. I am having problems with cross-domain requests.. anyone have any advice?
[00:41:12] <rootcoma> remote images, like photobucket, or imgur
[01:07:48] <thaz> hi
[01:08:46] <thaz> is there a proper jquery solution (or UI component) to improve the Select markup and the cut of the options on IE ?
[01:08:58] <marcules> Morgen
[01:12:13] <holmes> is there a way to solve this?
[01:12:15] <holmes> http://jsfiddle.net/yu2B9/
[01:12:32] <holmes> resizable thinks the canvas box is top left
[01:12:50] <holmes> and the x y is absolute position rather than relative
[01:13:07] <holmes> and my widht height doesnt work :(
[01:19:02] <marcules> that's odd holmes
[01:19:20] <holmes> is it
[01:20:00] <marcules> holmes, but for the relativity-problem
[01:20:03] <marcules> just use .position()
[01:22:58] <holmes> you mean like
[01:22:59] <holmes> var position = $(this).position();
[01:23:07] <holmes> and change the other offset to position instead?
[01:23:11] <marcules> holmes, and don't forget to give your container a position - e.g. position:relative
[01:23:25] <thaz> is there a proper jquery solution (or UI component) to improve the Select markup and the cut of the options on IE ?
[01:23:59] <holmes> aah that worked marcules
[01:24:06] <holmes> thanks
[01:24:13] <marcules> holmes, that's the same as with CSS/IE-debugging :D
[01:24:27] <marcules> If you have something absolute, it only becomes relative, if the containment has a position
[01:24:42] <marcules> Or else it defaults to the document body
[01:25:04] <marcules> http://jsfiddle.net/yu2B9/5/
[01:26:14] <marcules> thaz, no idea, sorry :/
[01:28:50] <holmes> slight problem marcules
[01:29:03] <holmes> you can move the logo 12px to the right
[01:29:05] <holmes> outside the ox
[01:29:06] <holmes> box
[01:29:12] <holmes> 15 at some places
[01:29:33] <holmes> oh depends on where im holding it, if i hold the image in the left corner
[01:29:37] <holmes> it goes out further on the right
[01:30:07] <holmes> hmm not only that it increases every time i try
[01:30:35] <marcules> :d
[01:30:46] <holmes> just moved it outside the box D:
[01:31:00] <marcules> I see
[01:31:27] <EweR> Good morning!
[01:31:32] <marcules> where do you calculate the borders?
[01:32:01] <holmes> ah
[01:32:06] <holmes> is that what causes it?
[01:32:15] <marcules> hmm not sure
[01:32:15] <holmes> nope
[01:32:21] <holmes> tried removing borders
[01:32:25] <marcules> no
[01:32:30] <marcules> You can still move it out :/
[01:32:59] <holmes> it only does it right and down
[01:33:08] <holmes> oh nvm
[01:33:10] <holmes> i found the problem
[01:33:15] <holmes> wait no
[01:35:27] <marcules> Even with the default drag function it is movable outside of the parent
[01:36:10] <holmes> ah
[01:36:46] <holmes> marcules it doesnt move out if you remove resizable
[01:40:52] <marcules> holmes, it does, but slower
[01:41:08] <marcules> holmes, and only if you move it straight to the right
[01:44:41] <Whiskey> Is there anyway to emulate "display:table/display: table-cell/display: table-row" whit jQuery for IE6/7?
[01:44:50] <marcules> holmes, I think I know where the problem is
[01:45:05] <holmes> is it my code?
[01:45:06] <holmes> hehe
[01:46:05] <marcules> I have to verify ^^
[01:46:16] <marcules> eah
[01:46:17] <marcules> yeah
[01:46:48] <marcules> wait no, there are multiple problems
[01:47:33] <marcules> first of all, the underlaying problem was, that your image was not display:block -> http://jsfiddle.net/yu2B9/6/
[01:47:47] <marcules> But there is still a problem with the resize-thingy
[01:51:23] <holmes> actually both
[01:51:28] <holmes> if i remove resizable i can still drag it down
[01:51:30] <holmes> below the limit
[01:53:59] <alexandernst_> I have a resizable div ( $(mydiv).resizable... ) and I'm handling the resize callback. Inside that callback function I'm doing some stuff that may take some time to finish (0.2-0.3s maybe). Could another resize event generate a call to my callback handler before the first one is finished?
[01:54:49] <alexandernst_> I'm sorry if I didn't exaplin myself well enough. I can redo the question if it's not understandable
[01:55:11] <marcules> holmes, can you drag this out? http://jsfiddle.net/yu2B9/7/
[01:55:25] <holmes> nope
[01:55:32] <holmes> was parent the only thing you did?
[01:55:43] <holmes> ooh
[01:55:45] <holmes> no <img
[01:56:10] <holmes> thanks
[01:56:23] <holmes> very fiddly
[01:57:28] <marcules> holmes, the problem is - the prol
[01:57:33] <marcules> the problem is still there
[01:57:35] <marcules> If you add resize
[01:57:58] <holmes> ah
[01:57:58] <holmes> yeah
[01:58:02] <holmes> but it works when its just draggable
[01:58:28] <marcules> holmes, thats just... odd...
[01:58:40] <marcules> did you consider filing a bug - or asking in the ui-channel?
[01:59:27] <holmes> yeah i could do that¨
[01:59:34] <holmes> might be a issue with ui since it adds some stuff to it
[02:00:03] <Aqeel> hi all
[02:00:11] <Aqeel> loving 1.9.0 so cool
[02:00:22] <Aqeel> but i got one question
[02:02:01] <motaka2> hello when I use tinymce , jquery blur event doesnt work for the text area , what should I do ?
[02:02:16] <Aqeel> is if ($("#a, #b").hasClass('c')){... same as if ($("#a").hasClass('c') && $("#b").hasClass('c')){...
[02:02:38] <hero> I am making a $.post call on change event for my form. It is causing the form elements to become sluggish as they're waiting for the event to complete. How do I ensure the value selection remains smooth even though the ajax call is going on?
[02:09:30] <Aqeel> please any one please explain
[02:09:34] <Aqeel> 	is if ($("#a, #b").hasClass('c')){... same as if ($("#a").hasClass('c') && $("#b").hasClass('c')){...
[02:11:05] <NodeX> no, you'll need to do eash
[02:11:08] <NodeX> each*
[02:11:27] <NodeX> as it will being a collection of nodes not a singular for comparison
[02:11:35] <fubhy> hey there.. I am stuck with jQuery 1.4 due to Drupal and for some reason I am experiencing massive memory leaks when using repeated .clone() and .remove() on the previously cloned element. Normally, I'd expect this to purge the previously cloned tree entirely and leave me with 0 memory overhead but in realitity the .remove() itself seems to cause a dramatic memory leak... Any ideas?
[02:12:18] <fubhy> For some reason, until it reaches the .remove() everything is fine but .remove() seams to double the memory usage (so it's not even the .clone() which causes this apparently)
[02:13:02] <mooru> jcanvas vs canvas query, which is the best to use?
[02:14:14] <Aqeel> thanks

[02:45:47] <KebabBob> Has anyone got experience with this? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin I'm trying to access the json response from within the "done" function. I assumed it was the files object, but it isn't..

[02:56:58] <acxty> Hi guys, Is it possible to have tooltip() without any effect?
[03:01:04] <MalMen> how can i prevent a form of submitting ?
[03:01:48] <Chepra_> return false; in the eventhandler
[03:04:29] <mindis|wurk> or use preventDefault()
[03:09:49] <holmes> marcules found a workaround after much googling
[03:10:01] <holmes> snap: "#outer", snapMode: "inner" , snapTolerance: 3
[03:10:04] <holmes> on the draggable
[03:10:18] <holmes> since it only moves max 3 pixels outside of the box it just snaps back in when you try to
[03:13:26] <norbi> hi guys
[03:13:47] <Guest81361> i have a small issue that i havent met until now
[03:14:46] <Guest81361> i do an ajax request to an url specified like this: url: "http://www.myurl.com/script.php" i get back a 200 ok status code but ajax throws an error
[03:15:19] <Guest81361> if i specify the url like this url: "script.php" then status code is still 200 ok but without error and the proper response
[03:16:24] <Guest81361> the problem is that i have to specify the domain in the url because abosulte path wont work because mod_rewrite is used and .htacces, so the url's arent valid paths...
[03:17:57] <Guest81361> why does it drop an error when domain is specified, and the domain is the same from the script comes, i know that there is a cross site scripting policy that doesnt allow to post scripts to external urls but still the script is from that domain and i send the request back to that domain
[03:18:46] <Guest81361> anyone any idea?
[03:23:04] <AdamPDotty> urls are not supposed to be paths; mod_rewrite does not only apply to absolute urls
[03:23:56] <AdamPDotty> maybe you use an alias domain?
[03:24:24] <Guest81361> AdamPDotty: you are right, but problem is still the same, i cant give as parameter a relative path for the url
[03:24:33] <Guest81361> i use www.
[03:25:32] <AdamPDotty> for AJAX a subdomain (like www) is different from the top domain
[03:25:54] <Guest81361> maybe that www. is causing it but i would not think off, because the source script is from www.mysite.com/some/html then the url: www.mysite.com/libcont/script.php
[03:27:00] <Guest81361> AdamPDotty: so maybe thats it, but since i use in addres www too and in the ajax www too it should work properly, i will try to remove www from constants...
[03:28:32] <Guest81361> AdamPDotty: you were right, i had no www in the request constant and in the site url constant it was with www....
[03:28:40] <Guest81361> AdamPDotty: thank you!
[03:28:44] <AdamPDotty> fine
[03:31:11] <hero_> I am making a $.post call on change event for my form. It is causing the form elements to become sluggish as they're waiting for the event to complete. How do I ensure the value selection remains smooth even though the ajax call is going on?
[03:38:30] <ponkumaran> what is jquery??
[03:41:14] <anew> wut
[03:41:18] <marcules> holmes, it is really weird - I guess the 3px come from the drag-thingy on the bottom right
[03:43:10] <agnitio> I'd like to slide the ottom panel *over* the main container but am stuck as to how to do that...  http://jsfiddle.net/Cdvbw/3/
[03:52:57] <Cork> ugg...
[03:53:25] <Cork> $.event.trigger doens't triggers as it did before :s
[03:53:40] <Cork> i have a feeling 1.9 is going to be a fun version...
[03:58:23] <Cork> so... global events has been removed completely in jquery 1.9??
[03:59:33] <the_kick> ive been reading about the new on() and off().
[03:59:33] <the_kick> why not use on() for every event now?
[03:59:44] <the_kick> instead of click(), etc
[03:59:47] <Cork> the_kick: you can
[04:00:02] <the_kick> Cork: does Can == Should though?
[04:00:09] <Cork> on is a combination of bind and delegate
[04:00:16] <czytacz> hi, I have made this simple script using "each": http://jsfiddle.net/TyYhm/ - is there a way to make a fuction work for each "img" element but in random order?
[04:00:22] <Cork> click has always been a convenience function
[04:00:58] <Cork> the_kick: but if you by on mean its delegation features, then ya if you want it on multiple elements you should most always user delegate
[04:01:06] <geiregjo> Hey, I've been working on a browser application and I'm running into some unexplainable issues in IOS browsers. I think it is related to the window.open() method. Is there a big difference between the IOS browsers and the desktop browsers?
[04:01:46] <marcules> czytacz, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-a-javascript-array
[04:02:49] <the_kick> Cork: ok thanks, plus i also notice different techniques. One is using the document as the element and using a selector argument , and another is actually specifying the exact element and not using a selector. I'm slightly unsure why there are 2 ways and which is preferred.
[04:03:21] <Cork> the_kick: looks like its better to take the long explanation
[04:03:46] <Cork> $(elm).click === $(elm).bind('click') === $(elm).on('click')
[04:04:35] <Cork> $('selector').live('click') === $(document).delegate('selector', 'click') === $(document).on('click', 'selector')
[04:04:47] <the_kick> Cork: got you
[04:04:50] <Cork> live has been depricated
[04:04:57] <the_kick> so it really doesnt matter then
[04:04:59] <Cork> and it used a broken way to target elements
[04:05:10] <Cork> the_kick: what it does matters a lot
[04:05:21] <the_kick> no i mean looking at your examples
[04:05:24] <Cork> $(document). will bind the listener on document, and filter on the selector
[04:05:26] <Cork> ah
[04:05:27] <Cork> ya
[04:05:27] <the_kick> i could use either or
[04:05:30] <the_kick> cool
[04:05:34] <Cork> except for .live the reset doesn't matter
[04:05:40] <Cork> live is just plain evil
[04:05:45] <Cork> and should never have been in there
[04:05:48] <the_kick> thanks very much!
[04:08:11] <the_kick> Cork: im pasting this into a document b4 i forget :P
[04:13:59] <Cork> shouldn't this work in 1.9? http://jsfiddle.net/6qhGz/
[04:19:17] <czytacz> marcules: so I should count them first?
[04:20:03] <xec> Cork: where did you get "$.event.trigger" from? is it documented somewhere?
[04:20:16] <Cork> xec: sure
[04:21:06] <czytacz> marcules: i mean, i need to somehow assign index numbers or sth to each element, right?
[04:22:09] <Cork> xec: can't find any thats from jquery though
[04:22:54] <Cork> but i honnestly can't find why it doesn't work
[04:25:50] <lombrozo> Can anyone tell me why this *SIMPLE* jquery code isn't working in IE9? http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/180113_024501.xml
[04:25:58] <lombrozo> works in FireFox
[04:26:15] <Cork> uh... thats xml...
[04:27:07] <geiregjo> :D
[04:27:21] <lombrozo> Cork - yes, it's translated using an XSL style-sheet in to HTML...
[04:27:40] <Cork> lombrozo: i meant i can't see a single line of jquery in that page
[04:27:46] <Cork> just xml
[04:27:51] <marcules> czytacz, you've got an array if you use $('img') or something
[04:28:13] <lombrozo> Cork - it's translated using an XSL style-sheet in to HTML... I don't think you'll see the jquery source if you 'View as source'
[04:28:27] <czytacz> marcules: oh, didnt know that :) thanks
[04:28:28] <Cork> then how are we suppose to help you?
[04:28:31] <lombrozo> Cork - the HTML that will be generated is here: http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/EventLog.xsl
[04:29:12] <lombrozo> Cork - (ignore the functions at the top)
[04:29:13] <Cork> lombrozo: produce a pure html + js file and try again
[04:29:25] <sm_> i needed to log in jquery forum , am i right?
[04:29:26] <lombrozo> Cork - will try that...
[04:29:37] <Cork> reduce the error factor if you don't know what happens
[04:30:04] <sm_> how to distinguish click and dbclick event handler in  jquery
[04:31:08] <marcules> czytacz, you may need to use .get() though, sometimes you won't get an array but an object back
[04:31:12] <sm_> i use both event handler in my code but it seems two click are not considered as a dblclick they are considered as 2 click method instead , what can i do for that?
[04:31:27] <Cork> sm_: click is triggered when its clicked, dbclick when you click it twice in a row
[04:31:48] <Cork> sm_: so click; click & dbclick
[04:32:13] <Cork> sm_: only way to "not trigger" click is to wait and see if the dbclick comes and then not do what you intended if you get it
[04:32:14] <sm_> Cork you're right
[04:32:36] <xec> Cork: the reason i asked about the docs have samples like $("#foo").trigger("click"), and in that demo doing $("div").trigger("super") works. or if you do $(document).on("super", ...) the $.event.trigger() works
[04:32:41] <Cork> and there's really no way to know if a dbclick will come
[04:32:48] <xec> don't ask me why, haven't looked at the implementation
[04:33:15] <sm_> <Cork>you're right but i click the link twice without any interuption but the result is what i said
[04:33:16] <Cork> xec: ya $.event.trigger is global
[04:33:31] <Cork> xec: it triggers ALL listeners, nomatter what element its bound to
[04:33:40] <Cork> xec: and that's what i need
[04:34:01] <sm_> <Cork>as You were saying how i can wait and check if the click is dbclick or not?
[04:34:33] <sm_> <Cork>can i say more detail about my problem?
[04:35:05] <xec> Cork: $("*").trigger('super'); trololol
[04:36:20] <xec> (yeah i know, it was a joke)
[04:36:44] <Cork> sm_: http://jsfiddle.net/rVxnM/
[04:36:52] <Cork> xec: lovely...
[04:37:06] <xec> don't do that at home, kids
[04:37:14] <Cork> xec: what annoys me is that ajaxComplete/ajaxStart... works and it uses the same command -_-'
[04:37:23] <xec> that's strange
[04:37:53] <Cork> yes it is
[04:39:02] <sm_> <Cork>ok ,i follow your link ,you are right but i need to enable a link only respond to one click but not once because after that it can be clicked again
[04:39:19] <Cork> xec: view-source:http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.js :7831
[04:39:55] <sm_> i use dblclick method and set that to an empty function and then an action i want to do in a click handler but the result is frustrating
[04:39:56] <Cork> sm_: do you mean you want to add a listener that only let you click the target once?
[04:40:47] <Cork> cause if you do, theres a simpler way to do that
[04:41:01] <sm_> once at every instant
[04:41:09] <Cork> ?.one @ sm_
[04:41:10] <bot-t> sm_, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[04:41:21] <sm_> <Cork>once at every instant but not for all the time
[04:41:54] <Cork> i don't see what dblclick is meant to fix here
[04:42:02] <Cork> it has little to do with the click event
[04:42:15] <Cork> except they both trigger from the same user action sometimes
[04:43:17] <sm_> <+bot-t>thank you but  i need to respond to the click event of the link later not only for the first time
[04:43:45] <lombrozo> Can anyone tell me why the jquery code isn't working here please: http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/EventLog.html
[04:44:05] <Cork> sm_: ok, you need to explain what you need to be done
[04:44:13] <Cork> sm_: and bot-t is just that a bot
[04:45:25] <Cork> ?.ready @ lombrozo
[04:45:26] <bot-t> lombrozo, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[04:45:53] <Cork> lombrozo: you're running your selectors before the html is parsed so the dom is empty
[04:46:28] <lombrozo> Cork: Ok, I kinda understand
[04:46:36] <lombrozo> Cork: I need to use .ready then?
[04:47:10] <sm_> <Cork> i have a form that is opend for the user when user click a link but i need to open that only once for every time -but users can click this several times every time and in return this form open several times
[04:47:16] <Cork> yes wrap it in $(function() { /* your code */ }); or $(document).ready(function() { /* your code */ });
[04:47:24] <sm_> and this is not what i need .
[04:47:43] <sm_> <Cork> i use
[04:47:51] <Cork> sm_: that was for lombrozo
[04:48:09] <sm_> <Cork>what do you mean?
[04:48:11] <nj|vpn> hello, how do i add an <a> element to a dynamically created element?  Here is an example of how i thought it should be but isn't: http://pastebin.com/Q8n0MjV1
[04:48:15] <Cork> sm_: so you need to prevent the from from getting opened more then once at a time?
[04:48:30] <Cork> sm_: like "if its open, don't open another one"?
[04:48:47] <sm_> yeah sth like this?
[04:49:06] <sm_> but my form is opened with an ajax request
[04:49:10] <Cork> sm_: then in your click event check if a form is opened
[04:49:16] <Cork> and if it is; don't do anything
[04:49:40] <Cork> or add a data('opened', true); and check if its true
[04:49:48] <Cork> sm_: dblclick can't help you at all
[04:50:00] <sm_> <Cork>thanks a lot i can check it now but my another question is
[04:50:23] <sm_> <Cork> when user click this like twice simultaneouly i mean twice in a row
[04:50:41] <Cork> nj|vpn: $('body').append('<div><a href="url">info</a></div>')
[04:50:58] <sm_> form is not loaded yet so how can i check if there is another one and prevent loading another one?
[04:52:02] <nj|vpn> Cork: ok thank you, is no reasonable way with document.createElement?
[04:52:02] <Cork> sm_: if(!$(this).hadClass('clicked')){ /* you're code */ }
[04:52:06] <Cork> nj|vpn: $('<div>') === document.createElement('div')
[04:52:59] <nj|vpn> Cork: alright, thank you.
[04:53:35] <Cork> nj|vpn: and if you do myDiv = $('<div/>'); myDiv.append('<a>'); $('body').append(myDiv)
[04:53:38] <Cork> you get the flow :)
[04:53:47] <seutje> Cork: wouldn't that be $('<div>')[0] ?
[04:53:58] <seutje> :P
[04:54:00] <Cork> seutje: don't be so picky ;P
[04:54:15] <seutje> sry, I'll go be a dick in our company channel instead ;)
[04:54:26] <nj|vpn> yeah, i just didn't think of using $('<div>') so thank you
[04:54:35] <Cork> nj|vpn: that said though; be aware that createElement + append is quite slow compared to building html strings and parsing
[04:55:42] <nj|vpn> i'm not sure the correct term for what i'm doing, but i'm lazy loading with a buffer so i havent noticed any speed differences
[04:56:26] <Cork> nj|vpn: just do a benchmark test where you create a table with 10000 cells through append
[04:56:38] <Cork> and compare that to building an html string and then appending that text string

[04:56:49] <bot-t> Cork, jsPerf: JavaScript performance playground - http://jsperf.com/
[04:57:10] <xec> hehe google is clever <3
[04:57:34] <lombrozo> Cork - thanks, that worked, though for my transformed XML it doesn't http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/180113_024501.xml
[04:57:59] <lombrozo> Cork - I wonder if it's something to do with my IE preferences as for the EventLog.html it prompted to load an ActiveX...
[04:58:11] <lombrozo> Cork - but for the XML it doesn't prompt...
[04:58:29] <sm_> <Cork> i try  your first suggestion but it has the problem i said
[04:58:57] <sm_> <Cork>thanks alot
[04:59:00] <Cork> lombrozo: you haven't added the ready wrapper
[04:59:17] <lombrozo> Cork - Sorry, hadn't uploaded, it should be there now
[05:00:14] <Cork> lombrozo: load http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/EventLog.xsl hit ctrl+f5
[05:00:16] <Cork> works for me
[05:00:28] <Cork> (if you go back to the old page that is :) )
[05:01:17] <lombrozo> Cork - In IE9?
[05:03:11] <Cork> ah right
[05:05:13] <Cork> lombrozo: side note you should be sure to add a doctype to your page
[05:05:34] <Cork> lombrozo: <!doctype html> is enough (before <html>)
[05:05:50] <Cork> lombrozo: not sure why is fails on the xsl file
[05:05:55] <Trisox> sup cork
[05:06:15] <Cork> Trisox: banging my head at jquery 1.9
[05:06:21] <Trisox> oeee
[05:06:31] <Trisox> wy?
[05:06:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6qhGz/
[05:06:52] <caddoo> If a third party script causes a form to submit
[05:06:52] <Cork> i can't find any notes that that should stop working in 1.9; but it does
[05:06:59] <caddoo> is there a way to catch this and do something else instead
[05:07:21] <Cork> caddoo: not really
[05:07:36] <Trisox> hmm
[05:07:41] <Cork> you could inject a submit event listener, but you might miss it
[05:07:50] <caddoo> right
[05:08:17] <caddoo> ok ill have to find a workaround
[05:08:55] <Cork> caddoo: btw is the other script submitting a form or what is it submitting?
[05:08:56] <Cork> ajax?
[05:09:15] <caddoo> no it assigns a hidden field
[05:09:21] <caddoo> then must perform .submit() or something
[05:10:13] <Cork> if it's not "or something"
[05:10:24] <Cork> you can just bind a on('submit') on the form
[05:10:26] <jlebrech> in jquery ui is it possible to change showchoices to add a data attribute?
[05:10:36] <Trisox> cork its weird indeed
[05:10:40] <caddoo> ok thanks Cork
[05:10:46] <Cork> caddoo: but if it uses ajax, your out of luck
[05:10:53] <caddoo> It doesn't
[05:11:13] <Cork> Trisox: even funnier if you check the source ajax do jQuery.event.trigger('ajaxStart') ...
[05:12:00] <Cork> and now i'm off
[05:13:28] <Trisox> cork
[05:14:38] <Trisox> nm
[05:20:47] <dashavoo> does anyone use jqueryui with zurb foundation and have any idea how I can get inline datepickers to play along with the grid system?
[05:23:40] <caddoo> would $('form').submit(function(){ return false } stop all forms from submitting
[05:23:51] <caddoo> if they are submitted with .submit()
[05:31:14] <AdamPDotty> I would guess yes, but preferred methode would be e.preventDefault()
[05:41:30] <aaairc> i'm dynamically adding images to my page, and i only want to show the image after it has loaded... can anyone recommended a way of doing this? .load doesn't seem to work for moe
[05:41:33] <aaairc> for me
[05:43:51] <thirdender> is there a version of hoverIntent that works with delegated event handlers?
[05:45:24] <xec> aaairc: you want to show images only after they are loaded? isn't this the default? surely you can't see an image that isn't loaded? what am i missing
[05:46:30] <aaairc> if the image has a border, you can see that border immediately when the image is appended to the page
[05:46:48] <aaairc> even though the image hasn't loaded yet and thus all you see is a border with no image inside it
[05:46:54] <aaairc> which makes for an ugly load experience
[05:46:58] <xec> right, i see
[05:47:19] <aaairc> additionally, i don't know the size of the image ahead of time... so the border starts out the wrong size and then expands to encompass the image
[05:47:19] <xec> aaairc: well, .load() would be my suggestion - what happens? event never fires?
[05:47:43] <aaairc> .load() doesn't seem to work in chrome and i read online that there is some issue with .load and webkit
[05:47:55] <aaairc> maybe i just tried implementing it wrong or something though
[05:48:12] <xec> iirc it won't fire if the image is cached
[05:49:09] <aaairc> xec: oh that could be it... how can i get around that then?
[05:50:17] <shoky> seems fine to me http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FVuAh/
[05:50:24] <xec> you can check for something like "completed" for those cases
[05:53:44] <aaairc> shoky: does the image have to be appended to the body first before .load is called?
[05:53:55] <shoky> nope
[05:54:08] <shoky> (but it has to be appended to body before the load callback is called, of course)
[05:54:17] <shoky> mm at least i think so
[05:55:48] <xec> seems to work for cached images too
[05:57:12] <jeffsmykil> dumb question, can you use a comma in an id?
[05:57:48] <xec> yes but it's not a good idea, and you can't select it with $("#my,stupid,id")
[05:58:19] <jeffsmykil> weird I'm having all sorts of issues with var id = #my,id
[05:58:20] <seutje> same for dots, semicolons, ...
[05:58:23] <jeffsmykil> and then getting data with it
[05:59:00] <xec> i hope that is pseudocode
[05:59:04] <seutje> you have to escape them for getElementById and qsa will just throw an error afaik
[05:59:12] <jeffsmykil> sec yeah it is
[05:59:14] <seutje> (so will sizzle)
[05:59:45] <jeffsmykil> changing it to a dash worked
[05:59:50] <jeffsmykil> lesson learned
[05:59:52] <jeffsmykil> hour wasted
[05:59:52] <xec> i don't think it will throw an error, i think it would just try to select id="my" and <stupid> and <id>
[06:00:22] <jeffsmykil> yeah i think it tried to do both
[06:00:27] <jeffsmykil> and it was finding undefined
[06:00:38] <xec> both what?
[06:01:09] <jeffsmykil> so it was thinking it was $("#test", "something")
[06:01:10] <jeffsmykil> perhaps
[06:01:40] <xec> not quite, but i see what you mean
[06:02:30] <xec> second parameter to $() is context
[06:03:38] <xec> a (single) comma in a (single) selector string means you have two selectors, basically
[06:04:00] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats what i figured was king on
[06:05:47] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you around?
[06:10:46] <satyamash> Hi
[06:11:06] <satyamash> The following fiddle seems to work on Firefox, but not on Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/2ABAh/21/
[06:11:22] <satyamash> I have Firefox 18.0.1 and Chromium 24
[06:11:34] <jeffsmykil> why are you using data-my-id?
[06:11:40] <jeffsmykil> instead of like value
[06:12:33] <satyamash> jeffsmykil: I am storing it using HTML5 custom data attributes..
[06:13:25] <jeffsmykil> i understand
[06:13:27] <jeffsmykil> but why?
[06:13:33] <jeffsmykil> for the sake of using them'.?
[06:13:58] <satyamash> no, the text between the <option></option> is not what I want. I need the ID to query back to the server
[06:14:15] <jeffsmykil> right
[06:14:32] <satyamash> jeffsmykil: Something like this-> http://jsfiddle.net/2ABAh/23/
[06:14:33] <shoky> satyamash: either http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2ABAh/22/  or  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2ABAh/26/
[06:14:59] <jeffsmykil> i think the value one makes more sense imo
[06:15:02] <jeffsmykil> but its your code
[06:16:15] <satyamash> shoky: I think http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2ABAh/26/ would not apply to http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2ABAh/23/
[06:16:36] <satyamash> shoky: I guess using option:selected is a possible solution
[06:16:54] <jeffsmykil> the values are coincidental
[06:16:59] <jeffsmykil> the option 1 value could be foo
[06:17:03] <jeffsmykil> and it would still return 1
[06:17:24] <satyamash> But I guess this is a bug ?
[06:17:26] <shoky> satyamash:  anyway just know that click events on <option>s don't work good cross-browser
[06:18:02] <satyamash> option:selected it is then I guess..
[06:18:07] <satyamash> Maybe I should file a bug
[06:18:08] <shoky> or change to value..
[06:18:10] <shoky> you shouldn't
[06:18:22] <shoky> it's known to most everyone already
[06:18:26] <shoky> it's ooooooooooold.
[06:19:26] <satyamash> hmm ok. How would I use value? I mean to get the ID ?
[06:19:39] <shoky> my example shows it..
[06:19:46] <satyamash> shoky: right fiddle 26
[06:20:13] <satyamash> shoky: .val() directly binds to the 'value' attribute?
[06:20:23] <shoky> value property, yes
[06:20:44] <shoky> but
[06:20:58] <shoky> the value property of <select>s are automatically changed to the value property of the selected <option>
[06:21:00] <shoky> by the browser
[06:21:06] <shoky> hence using values makes more sense
[06:21:35] <satyamash> hmm okay, I guess it is a more browser independent approac
[06:22:03] <shoky> tho there's nothing wrong with option:selected either if you wanna use .data() for this
[06:22:12] <jeffsmykil> accept
[06:22:17] <jeffsmykil> if the option values update
[06:22:31] <jeffsmykil> then data() won't work and you will have to use attr() to get the new values
[06:22:37] <shoky> what?
[06:22:46] <shoky> what do you mean, the values update
[06:22:54] <jeffsmykil> data caches the value the first time you access it
[06:23:01] <shoky> it caches the attribute
[06:23:10] <shoky> at runtime you shouldnt care about the attribute anymore
[06:23:13] <pielgrzym_black> I have such construct inside click event callback:                                         var input = $('<input type="text" value="'+val+'">').appendTo($(this)).find('input');
[06:23:15] <shoky> you can still change the data
[06:23:44] <jeffsmykil> but you can't access the new data with data can you?
[06:23:48] <jeffsmykil> you have to use attr
[06:23:50] <shoky> sure you can..
[06:23:59] <jeffsmykil> let me find the thing i ready this am
[06:24:01] <shoky> you set and get with .data
[06:24:01] <pielgrzym_black> why doesn't input.bind('blur.somename', somefunct) work in this case? and why does it work with $(this).find('input').bind... ?
[06:24:18] <satyamash> shoky: So this fails only for <option>? will it work for <li></li>
[06:24:42] <shoky> satyamash: yea its only about click events on <option>
[06:24:49] <shoky> prolly other events too
[06:27:42] <shoky> pielgrzym:  var input = $('<input type="text" value="'+val+'">').appendTo($(this));
[06:27:48] <jeffsmykil> shaky I'm reading about data now, maybe i misunderstood what i read this morning
[06:28:04] <shoky> pielgrzym_black: drop the .find('input')
[06:28:37] <DarkKnightCZ> hi, how to check if page is truly loaded in IE? $(document),ready() is working correctly in every browser, but in IE its fired prematurely
[06:28:46] <jeffsmykil> shoky i think i was referring to this answerr
[06:28:54] <jeffsmykil> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261619/jquery-data-vs-attr
[06:29:58] <pielgrzym_black> shoky: yup, I have to run separate find, since this one referred to the input element itself.
[06:31:00] <cdwSymfony> greetings
[06:31:21] <pielgrzym_black> one more odd thing: after creating this input I hook a keydown callback to the input. from inside the callback I refere to $(this).parent('span').next() and always get empty object (there are at least 80 other spans like this). any idea why?
[06:32:18] <shoky> pielgrzym:  the direct parent isn't a span or doesn't have a next sibling
[06:32:36] <shoky> pielgrzym_black: you probably want closest('span') instead of parent('span')
[06:34:23] <pielgrzym_black> shoky: the input has one parent (span.editable) and in firebug I can see that referring to $(this).parent('span') points to right element, but it has no .next(). But! I think that this is because there is only one parent span, so next() is actualy trying to find next parent span not next span.editable, right?
[06:35:14] <shoky> pielgrzym_black:  next() tries to find the next sibling element, whatever it is. it only filters if you pass in a selector like for .parent('span')
[06:35:34] <pielgrzym_black> shoky: ah
[06:37:15] <pielgrzym_black> I have a table - in each td there is a span.editable. on click contents of this span are replaced by the input (whoose value is previous span content). Now on hitting 'tab' (e.keyCode 9) inside the input I want to trigger click of the next span.editable. the $(this).parent('span').next() is a wrong path? Could someone point me to a good direction? ;)
[06:37:33] <shoky> ?demo
[06:37:34] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:37:58] <pielgrzym_black> shoky: yeah, this might take some time :(
[06:42:07] <holmes> oh u
[06:42:56] <hugo_moss> is there a jquery method replace for javascript .bind?
[06:43:02] <hugo_moss> replacement
[06:43:15] <holmes> why is images sliding called a slider
[06:43:15] <holmes> googling slider helps very little since 80% of the results are sliding images
[06:43:15] <holmes> trying to bind a resizable div with a slider
[06:43:34] <milligan> I have an image that's located in a <td inside a <tr>. The <tr> has several <td>s, where most of the tds contain elements that are disabled. How can I loop through all elements of the containing tr and change disabled to enabled?
[06:43:38] <pielgrzym_black> ok, this points to right element now: $(this).parents('td').next().find('span.editable'). If I trigger a click on this element this doesn't automatically make any focused input blur. I guess I need to trigger blur of currently focused element myself, right?
[06:43:44] <milligan> (I want that to happen when the image is clicked)
[06:46:11] <ravenzz> does the jquery ui plugins accept a callback ? something like onInitialized
[06:46:26] <holmes> depends on which one i think
[06:46:31] <holmes> some have "start" and "stop"
[06:46:39] <ravenzz> datepicker?
[06:47:11] <holmes> try using start
[06:48:11] <ravenzz> as an option?
[06:48:46] <holmes> yeah
[06:48:57] <holmes> start: function(){}
[06:49:04] <holmes> i just started with javascript a few days ago
[06:49:06] <holmes> so im not 100%
[06:49:27] <ravenzz> nada
[06:49:28] <ravenzz> :p
[06:49:32] <holmes> jsfiddle it
[06:49:41] <ravenzz> ..
[06:51:17] <ravenzz> really?
[06:51:18] <Chris_CC_> hey guys, got a problem .. not sure if it's 100% jquery but, it's related so anyhelp would be great!   www.driveaddiction.com  clicking hte first box in the LATEST section will make a popup .. however i want to be able to click the name "- Chris CC" and for it to goto the profile page instead of the popup .. any ideas how to fix this?
[06:51:21] <ravenzz> holmes there you go http://jsfiddle.net/B7rNN/
[06:52:16] <milligan> nvm my question. I fixed it.
[06:53:01] <holmes> lemme check
[06:54:34] <nickSwe> OK I am STUCK! I am adding a value to a input textfield from an iframe using top.$('#foobar').val('added text'); ... but HOW can I have a listener that will do something when this text is added? I've tried $('#foobar').change(), I've tried all other sorts of focus, onkeypress, onkeyup, onkeydown... But NOTHING seems to fire when the text is set using the val() function.  Can anyone please give
[06:54:34] <nickSwe> me some hints on what to do here?
[06:54:59] <holmes> ravenzz oh theres no events
[06:55:01] <holmes> for datepicker
[06:56:14] <ravenzz> yeh
[06:57:56] <holmes> ravenzz make it do something when you click it?
[06:58:05] <holmes> since you trigger something for it anyways
[06:58:23] <aaairc> if i'm calling .addClass('someclass') potentially 100 times in a row... is it better to just call it repeatedly... because it only adds the class once... or should i do a check for .hasClass('someclass') and only add it if that returns false?
[06:58:27] <aaairc> or it just doesn't matter either way?
[06:58:30] <ravenzz> no I need to do something when it is binded
[06:58:39] <holmes> ah okey
[06:58:42] <ravenzz> i will extend datepicker or something
[06:59:58] <ravenzz> actually $.datepicker has an initialized property
[07:06:22] <idletask> Question: when you include your js using scripts at the _bottom_ of the page and not at the top, should the document.ready() also be at the bottom?
[07:06:44] <Cork> no
[07:06:57] <Cork> that will even break ie
[07:07:54] <idletask> Oh
[07:08:08] <idletask> Well well well
[07:08:23] <idletask> Thanks for the information...
[07:09:12] <idletask> Cork: do you mean only the document.ready() or all <script> tags as well?
[07:09:39] <Cork> no $(document).ready and $(function() {})
[07:10:12] <Cork> those should never be put into body, cause in some cases ie will trigger the event before those scripts are parsed
[07:10:30] <idletask> "in some cases", as in "not always"? Yay
[07:10:31] <Cork> i learned this my self not too long ago :)
[07:10:41] <Cork> yup
[07:10:53] <Cork> i used to always use $(function() {})
[07:10:54] <idletask> What do you mean by $(function() {})? Please remind that I'm a JS rookie
[07:11:13] <Cork> $(function() {}) is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {})
[07:11:19] <Cork> it does the exact same thing
[07:11:27] <idletask> Ah
[07:11:41] <idletask> OK, but that function can be defined in a file included later on?
[07:11:56] <idletask> Well, at least it works for me on FF and Chrome
[07:12:09] <Cork> if the file is included in head, ya
[07:12:16] <Cork> else, no don't
[07:12:25] <idletask> Argh
[07:12:45] <idletask> I've been running Linux for more than 15 years so it's hard to account for IE
[07:13:04] <Cork> :)
[07:13:24] <idletask> OK, I'll change that then
[07:13:31] <Cork> ya, i've need running only linux for a few years my self; was dual booting for a long time though
[07:14:25] <Cork> idletask: if you plan on making webpages you most likely need a windows vm though
[07:14:50] <Cork> idletask: as windows font rendering is different from all the other oses
[07:19:49] <idletask> I don't have a Windows license to start with
[07:20:09] <idletask> That's a toy site anyway -- well, useful if you use JSON Schema
[07:20:48] <jeffsmykil> they make vms for designers of old versions of windows you can convert and run in a vm
[07:21:12] <jeffsmykil> http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11575
[07:23:38] <idletask> Ouch, 2.5 GB of rar achives for a simple Win7 VM running IE8?
[07:23:54] <idletask> jeffsmykil: link bookmarked
[07:24:10] <jeffsmykil> those run under Virtual PC
[07:24:13] <jeffsmykil> butttt
[07:24:28] <jeffsmykil> I think paul_irish or someone has a git repository for making them compatible with virtual box
[07:27:07] <idletask> Eh, I use KVM
[07:27:33] <Trisox> there is indeed a git repro
[07:27:49] <jeffsmykil> Trisox: is it paul_irish?
[07:27:52] <motaka2> in this code http://pastebin.com/D0fGMPSX on line 21 i get undefined as the result , why is that ? and what should I do ?
[07:27:53] <jeffsmykil> i can't remember
[07:28:30] <Trisox> http://xdissent.github.com/ievms/
[07:28:35] <Trisox> this one right
[07:29:01] <Trisox> its called ievms for sure
[07:29:13] <Trisox> jeffsmykil
[07:29:37] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats the one
[07:30:07] <Trisox> who!! and the crowd goes wild!
[07:30:19] <Trisox> ^^
[07:31:48] <jeffsmykil> I guess it wasn't paul, I have a default tendency to credit him when i can't think of who did it
[07:44:11] <hugo_moss> is there a jquery method replacement for javascript .bind?
[07:47:00] <thirdender> hugo_moss: you mean https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind ?
[07:47:40] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You mean like... .on()?
[07:54:08] <Nebros> is there one with german language and know how with django? (i know its not a jquery question)... ^^
[07:57:33] <marcules> How would I prevent an onClick-Event?
[07:57:59] <NodeX> bind a handler to it and preventDefault()
[07:58:00] <jeffsmykil> prevent default
[07:58:02] <marcules> Do I have to use jQuery._data( element, ...?
[07:58:11] <marcules> No, the binding is not on click but on onclick
[07:58:21] <marcules> preventDefault does not fire
[07:58:38] <marcules> Or at least it fires too late
[07:58:41] <NodeX> why dont you just remove the prop
[07:58:57] <marcules> It's generated - I have no influence on this
[07:59:04] <NodeX> onlick="..." is registered in the DOM
[07:59:31] <NodeX> you will have to grab the DOM methods list and delete it from there without causing a circular memory reference
[07:59:56] <marcules> mh
[08:03:06] <codecowboy> hi. anyone know why my slider control is squashed? I'm trying to move the elements of the slider control around and keep everything inline in a container div. http://jsfiddle.net/codecowboy/Bq2dn/
[08:06:46] <marcules> Well THIS is odd :D -- removeAttr('onclick') worked
[08:06:48] <marcules> lol
[08:08:19] <nullslash> Hi, I have a simple switch statement that gets executed 6 times every time I click on a button. Here is my snippet http://www.jspaste.com/?id=549, could anyone provide some hints?
[08:10:49] <nullslash> ping?
[08:11:18] <nullslash> timeout
[08:16:12] <Doobee> Hi. How come this class toggling doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/4Njqd/
[08:19:13] <shoky> Doobee: use jquery 1.9.0 or change the first one from onLoad to no wrap (head)
[08:20:44] <shoky> also.. never seen font-style: bolder
[08:21:30] <Cork> shoky: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/font-weight
[08:22:09] <shoky> weight it is
[08:22:36] <Cork> and its valid for font-style too
[08:23:28] <shoky> it is?
[08:23:36] <Cork> ya
[08:23:45] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/font-style
[08:23:52] <nullslash> 504 Gateway Time-out
[08:23:57] <Cork> ah no sorry
[08:24:00] <Cork> not font-style
[08:24:03] <Cork> but font:
[08:24:11] <shoky> ah
[08:24:37] <Cork> font: [[ font-style || font-variant || font-weight ]? font-size [ / line-height ]? font-family ] | caption | icon | menu | message-box | small-caption | status-bar
[08:28:29] <idletask> Is there somewhere a qtip1 to qtip2 migration guide?
[08:29:36] <Gho5t> when iterating using each, $('[data-category-name]').each(function(index, el) {... what is the rule for when you should use $(el) vs $(this)? for example, I need to get at the data-name attribute and using $(el).data('name') and $(this).data('name') both work
[08:37:58] <shoky> Gho5t: they'll always be equal i think..
[08:38:27] <Gho5t> yeah that's what I was thinking
[08:38:31] <Gho5t> kind of redundant
[08:39:05] <shoky> with the argument, you dont have to cache 'this'
[08:39:12] <shoky> for nested callbacks and shit
[08:39:45] <Gho5t> el isn't a jquery object
[08:39:51] <Gho5t> HtmlElement
[08:39:54] <shoky> so?
[08:39:57] <shoky> var self = this;
[08:40:00] <shoky> is what i'm talking about
[08:40:10] <Gho5t> gotcha
[08:41:05] <shoky> anyway there's nothing wrong with a bit of redundancy in APIs, as long as it doesn't put any redundancy in the user's code
[08:41:31] <shoky> i.e. you can do  .each(function() { $(this).whatever() })
[08:42:02] <zulu-gula2> I have a span with time in format <span>09:59</span> - how to make countdown on this element?
[08:42:25] <idletask> OK, qtip2 is a nightmare
[08:51:55] <mads-> zulu-gula2, make a count-down function and set the output to be there in between your spans
[08:53:34] <anonymus_> hello.
[08:54:11] <anonymus_> i have html file which contains div tag
[08:54:48] <anonymus_> i wrote jquery code for that.but dunno whr to place this jquery snippet.any help?
[08:57:32] <anonymus_> can i place the following jquery code  in html ?if so where?
[08:57:36] <anonymus_> $(document).ready(function() {     $('#photos').cycle({       fx: 'fade',  speedIn: 2500,    speedOut: 500,    timeout: 0,    next: '#photos'        }); });
[08:58:12] <jason_day> @anonymus_ before closing body tag
[08:58:20] <schuranator> Is there a good method to check if a string is all the same characters? I'm making a game and save the class to a string and just wanted to see if there is a better way to check if "aaaa" instead of looping through each character.
[08:58:35] <Gho5t> preferably in a script block
[08:58:45] <jason_day> agreed @Gho5t
[08:58:50] <svcghost> hey guys. So I know if($('[id^=quantity][value=0]').length)  would return true if there is any input with ID quantity and value 0, but how would I check to see if any input exists with ID quantity and a value that is not a number?
[08:58:55] <anonymus_> @jason: do i need to include tht within script tag?or directly?
[08:59:10] <jason_day> within script tag
[08:59:48] <BillCriswell> svcghost: You can use .filter().
[08:59:54] <velcrobots> need some help with this fiddle.  when clicking on a menu under a section, i want to close and "deselect" any OTHER sections: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/B6d35/
[08:59:59] <anonymus_> @jason: ok.letme  test nd let yu know.
[09:00:31] <thanpolas> Does this statement create one or multiple listeners? -->  $(document).on("click","a", listenerFunc);
[09:00:41] <jrajav> schuranator: /[^a]/.exec(string)
[09:00:43] <velcrobots> is there a "not" in JQ?  like a "not closest" leave open, close the rest?
[09:01:02] <jrajav> schuranator: Returns null if the string is empty or consists of all 'a' characters.
[09:01:07] <jason_day> @schuranator - regex: /^(.)\1+$/.test(pw) // true when "aaaa", false when "aaab".
[09:01:16] <NoiseEee> velcrobots: if only there was some sort of documentation for jquery somewhere!!!
[09:01:18] <BillCriswell> velcrobots: You could do closest('foo').siblings().hide();
[09:01:59] <jrajav> schuranator: Note that the regex will loop through all the characters anyway, if performance is your aim rather than ease/clarity. There's no way to do this WITHOUT looping through them somehow.
[09:02:11] <schuranator> ok
[09:02:34] <jason_day> Captures the first character using regex, then backreferences it (\1) checking if it's been repeated.
[09:02:53] <velcrobots> noiseeee: bite me. how do you think i figured all this out to begin with.  IRC has always been an easy way to get those last few kinks out, and people here are often very helpful in explaining.  then of course, there's you.
[09:02:58] <svcghost> BillCriswell: I'm having trouble with this :-\ would it be smarter to use isNumeric?
[09:03:31] <BillCriswell> svcghost: Are you just looking to see if there's any quantity fields that aren't a valid number?
[09:03:40] <svcghost> I want to check whether or not all inputs with ID quantityX have ONLY numbers
[09:03:50] <svcghost> quantity0, quantity1, etc.
[09:04:10] <fabioportieri> hi guys
[09:04:11] <svcghost> have only numbers as their values*
[09:04:22] <fabioportieri> anyone has played with xupload?
[09:04:44] <jason_day> you can force numeric: this.value = this.value.replace(/\D/g, '');
[09:05:16] <anonymus_> @jason: no. i dint get the result
[09:05:59] <anonymus_> actually am tryng to put slideshow effect on images wich  i inlcuded in div tag
[09:06:00] <jason_day> make sure jquery and the other script are loaded prior to the function being called
[09:06:26] <svcghost> jason_day: BillCriswell I think I may just use HTML5 to check
[09:06:34] <jason_day> i'm not sure how that plugin operates, but you'll need to follow the html setup for the plugin exactly, otherwise won't work
[09:06:34] <svcghost> I mean I will use the input type="number"
[09:06:59] <jason_day> HTML5 is always better
[09:07:08] <BillCriswell> That can work depending on the support of the browser. Just make sure you get some kind of shim to fall back on.
[09:07:22] <BillCriswell> or polyfill, whatever it's called.
[09:07:28] <anonymus_> actually i saved tht file .php extension as am testing in localhost
[09:07:28] <svcghost> Thanks!
[09:07:52] <BillCriswell> svcghost: You can use .filter() for what you're trying to so as well.
[09:08:48] <anonymus_> and i included these 2 plugins in head section
[09:08:50] <anonymus_> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.cycle.all.min.js"></script>
[09:09:04] <BillCriswell> $('input').filter(function(){ return !isNaN($(this).val()) });
[09:10:56] <velcrobots> billcriswell: can you take a look?  trying the closest-siblings thing here, missing something: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/B6d35/1/
[09:11:16] <fabioportieri> after a file upload i got SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character but i can't see the error aniwhere else, even if inspect xhr request with firebug
[09:11:20] <jason_day> anonymus: what's your html look like (snippet)
[09:12:00] <BillCriswell> velcrobots: Too much code for me to sift through here right now. Isolate the problem a bit more and it could help you out so much with figuring it out.
[09:12:07] <fabioportieri> as response i get the whole page
[09:13:51] <anonymus_> @jason: am pasting my simple code  in pastebin
[09:14:05] <anonymus_> i iwll give yu the link  in  2 mins
[09:16:09] <Kalculus> So I do   $someXML.find("row").each(function () {   ...      $(this).attr("something")      <--  the attr() call worked here in jQuery 1.8 in IE8 and IE9.  It also works in jQuery 1.9 in IE9, but it doesn't work in jQuery 1.9 in IE8 anymore.  It gives me "SCRIPT450: Wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignment".  Any idea?
[09:16:19] <jrockjiggz> velcrobots: like this? $(this).closest.. http://jsfiddle.net/B6d35/3/
[09:17:23] <anonymus_> @jason_day: please check my file here:  http://pastebin.com/jcHtxV3k
[09:17:45] <velcrobots> jrockjiggz: that's actually exactly what I just got to myself - but does this sort of thing not work in jsfiddle?
[09:17:51] <hugo_moss> when was @font-face support added in internet explorer? what version?
[09:18:40] <anonymus_> @jason_day:  r u there?
[09:18:53] <systemfault> hugo_moss: 4 IIRC
[09:19:11] <hugo_moss> yea thats what i dont understand
[09:19:16] <hugo_moss> im getting conflicting reports
[09:19:21] <systemfault> hugo_moss: Not sure what you don't understand...
[09:19:24] <anonymus_> my images are getting displayed one after the other instead of in slideshow form
[09:19:53] <hugo_moss> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp
[09:20:03] <hugo_moss> it says ie8 and before dont have @font-face
[09:20:08] <hugo_moss> but
[09:20:12] <jason_day> see what happens when you try just: $('#photos').cycle();
[09:20:17] <systemfault> hugo_moss: Stop using shitty websites.
[09:20:20] <idletask> What is the link in jQuery documentation to the different possible values for the first argument of .on()?
[09:20:25] <hugo_moss> on the html5please.com website it says you dont need a polyfill and should just use a fallback
[09:20:40] <velcrobots> jrockjiggz: maybe because the "menu-head" doesn't actually have the siblings.  the parent div does
[09:20:42] <velcrobots> lemme try something
[09:20:48] <anonymus_> @ok.letme check
[09:20:55] <hugo_moss> because im guessing ie8 and before supported @font-face but with only eot fonts
[09:20:57] <systemfault> hugo_moss: You need a weird syntax because ie doesn't support some of font-face's syntax
[09:21:06] <systemfault> hugo_moss: Yes, only with oe
[09:21:08] <systemfault> eot
[09:21:11] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[09:21:15] <hugo_moss> it has a different syntax?
[09:21:23] <idletask> hugo_moss: http://w3fools.com
[09:21:53] <pink_> hi jq
[09:21:57] <systemfault> hugo_moss: Some newer parameters aren't IIRC... just use the fontsquirrel generator and the generated CSS file..
[09:22:11] <systemfault> You don't want to remember the hacks to make it work on ie
[09:22:22] <pink_> so if i do $(el).find('...') any way to tell how many nodes deep the results are?
[09:22:44] <anonymus_> @jason_day : same result.no slideshow
[09:23:00] <hugo_moss> im trying to make it work for ie7
[09:23:00] <pink_> i guess i could do a loop of $(e).parent().parent().parent() until $(e).parent() == el
[09:23:11] <pink_> unless there is a helper func i dont know about
[09:23:13] <shoky> pink_ you can check .parents()
[09:23:20] <shoky> and parentsUntil
[09:23:20] <hugo_moss> might need to use zoom: 1
[09:23:22] <pink_> will that give the number?
[09:23:30] <shoky> no, you can then use index
[09:23:31] <systemfault> hugo_moss: Works fine... use the fontsquirrel syntax
[09:23:35] <pink_> index?
[09:23:49] <pink_> oh
[09:23:51] <Cardon> can someone help me out with a strange jQ-ui bug?  i've got a draggable element with it's parent as the containment, but it'll only allow me to drag the draggable element a short distance (~20px) before it stops.  however, if I click to drag, drag my mouse (while still holding) outside the parent element, and continue dragging, the draggable element works as intended
[09:23:54] <pink_> i  sorta see what you mean
[09:24:26] <hugo_moss> ok
[09:24:28] <hugo_moss> thank you
[09:24:29] <pink_> i could ... do something like $(e).parentsUntil($(el).parent()).length
[09:24:37] <pink_> that's funky lol but it might work
[09:25:00] <shoky> yeah thats sorta what i meant
[09:25:16] <anonymus_> @jason: whats wrong in my code?
[09:25:20] <pink_> word
[09:26:53] <thanpolas> Does anyone knows if the following statement creates one or multiple listeners on DOM? -->  $(document).on("click","a", listenerFunc);
[09:27:01] <shoky> thanpolas: one
[09:28:04] <thanpolas> shoky i've been using this tool: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2 to see what is going on, and i get a different count when having $(document).on("click","a", listenerFunc); vs $(document).on("click", listenerFunc);
[09:28:12] <thanpolas> can you confirm or explain what's going on?
[09:28:33] <lombrozo> Simple XML to HTML (via XSL) displays "Hello world" alert in FireFox but not in IE: http://www.lombrozo.co.uk/test/Simple.xml
[09:29:06] <anonymus_> @jason : there?
[09:30:30] <thanpolas> shoky it really looks like there's not one listener in the DOM
[09:30:47] <shoky> thanpolas: what element are you looking at
[09:30:48] <thanpolas> both from the tool i told you and the contents of the event object
[09:31:01] <thanpolas> all anchor elements of the page
[09:31:56] <shoky> thanpolas: both of those  only set a listener on the document element. maybe the tools are showing you delegated event handlers
[09:31:58] <shoky> on the <a>
[09:32:02] <idletask> OK, I'm desperate -- is there a link to a simple qtip2 example that actually works, or even better, a jsfiddle?
[09:32:57] <anonymus_> can anyone help me out?!
[09:33:48] <Cardon> anonymous, do you have a jsfiddle or something?
[09:33:52] <anonymus_> please check my file here:  http://pastebin.com/jcHtxV3k
[09:34:24] <anonymus_> i pasted my code in pastebin
[09:34:31] <thanpolas> shoky i think there is no way to "see" a delegated event
[09:34:36] <anonymus_> @cardon:please check my file here:  http://pastebin.com/jcHtxV3k
[09:35:30] <shoky> thanpolas:  the <a> is inside the document element. the document element has a click listener. since the <a> is in the document, it also has a listener, by proxy
[09:35:50] <shoky> maybe delegated was the wrong word
[09:36:03] <thanpolas> shoky then $(document).on('click') would result in every element having a listener by proxy
[09:36:05] <Cardon> what's it saying anon?
[09:36:15] <shoky> thanpolas: it does
[09:36:28] <thanpolas> shoky that does not happen (meaning the events are not acounted)
[09:36:45] <anonymus_> @those images are getting displayed one after the other in my webpage instead of lisdeshow effect on them
[09:36:50] <anonymus_> @cardon
[09:36:58] <shoky> thanpolas:  i dont know about that visual event tool.. i'm looking at chrome's inspector (shows event listeners)
[09:37:07] <Cardon> what slideshow effect are you looking for?
[09:37:14] <jason_day> anon - you'll also need css
[09:37:15] <Cardon> and what do you mean by "getting displayed"
[09:37:19] <anonymus_> fade
[09:37:26] <jason_day> #photos img {display: none;}
[09:37:42] <jason_day> and the cycle plugin will then show the images as it needs
[09:37:51] <thanpolas> shoky chrome's inspector shows the events in either case. The difference you can see out of the box is eventObject.currentTarget
[09:38:12] <anonymus_> @jason: ok .let me try nd say you.plz hold on.
[09:38:12] <b-ot> anonymus_, I am not in you.plz.
[09:38:13] <shoky> thanpolas:  chrome's inspector shows  a "node" field
[09:38:23] <shoky> thanpolas: which is where the event listener is actually set, i tjhink
[09:39:01] <shoky> well actually it shows the actual element name right at front
[09:39:16] <jrockjiggz> thanpolas: you can set up a script to count the listeners aswell
[09:39:58] <jason_day> @anon - you could also try creating a simple jsfiddle (jsfiddle.net)
[09:40:55] <anonymus_> @ jason_day and cardon: i will paste in jsfiddle nd give you the link.plz check them  out!
[09:40:58] <shoky> thanpolas: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/67u5A/1/
[09:43:33] <thanpolas> shoky i see

[09:44:21] <jrist> @jason will you please hold my hand
[09:46:30] <Proviss> I have a question:
[09:46:38] <thanpolas> shoky what's the definition of $._data() ?
[09:47:01] <shoky> thanpolas: it's an internal undocumented function, to access jquery's internal DOM data
[09:47:13] <shoky> .data() uses it
[09:47:29] <shoky> and other stuff
[09:49:55] <anonymus_> @jason: r u therE?
[09:50:03] <jason_day> @anon - you need css rules for the images
[09:50:12] <jason_day> #photos img {display: none;}
[09:50:53] <jason_day> but without a jsfiddle, it's a little hard to debug the user error
[09:50:55] <Gho5t> how do you hook into a radio button's disabled property changing?

[10:01:44] <Gho5t> BillCriswell: I need to do something anytime the "disabled" property is altered on a radio button
[10:01:45] <tlkr> your*
[10:01:46] <Gho5t> is what I mean
[10:02:10] <jason_day> see the fiddle I posted
[10:02:31] <anonymus_> whr sud  i     $('#photos').cycle(); ?
[10:03:13] <jason_day> you can still use a doc.ready - but you're either missing jquery or the cycle plugin
[10:04:05] <anonymus_> in my code,  i hv included na
[10:04:19] <anonymus_> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script
[10:04:33] <anonymus_> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.cycle.all.min.js"></script>
[10:04:40] <scriptraptor> Hi guys, can someone take a look if I am using prependTo correctly on Line:14 -- it doesn't seem to be working http://jsfiddle.net/6YUfP/
[10:04:41] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: You would need to use the change event and check to see if it's disabled.
[10:05:07] <Gho5t> BillCriswell: does changing the "disabled" property programmatically fire the change event?
[10:05:26] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: No. You would need to do .trigger('change') after.
[10:05:33] <Gho5t> crap
[10:05:38] <Gho5t> ok that's what I thought
[10:05:47] <anonymus_> @jason: can you plz edit my code nd get the output
[10:05:59] <MagmaRules> Hi there, i have a plugin that gets loaded in the end of my page and have the code jQuery(document).ready(function(J){ pluginFunct() }); and I'm getting an error that the function is not defined. This only happens in ie. How can i be sure that the function has been interpreted before i call it ?
[10:08:41] <anonymus_> @jason:  there?
[10:08:45] <Gho5t> if(window.pluginFunct) ?
[10:08:59] <jason_day> @anon - your fiddle was not setup correctly, so I couldn't use it as is
[10:09:09] <jason_day> you didn't include jquery, cycle, or full image paths
[10:09:12] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: $.fn.plugin might be better.
[10:09:15] <jason_day> i can only help so much
[10:09:24] <jason_day> you have to help yourself as well
[10:10:02] <scriptraptor> Can someone take a look if I am using prependTo correctly on Line:14 -- it doesn't seem to be working http://jsfiddle.net/6YUfP/
[10:10:07] <scriptraptor> when i prepend to body it works fine
[10:10:09] <anonymus_> hmm ok .
[10:10:13] <anonymus_> let me try again
[10:10:16] <anonymus_> nd tell u
[10:12:03] <idletask> OK, does someone have a working, bare-bones example of qtip2? I have been googling and trying for hours on end without any tangible result
[10:12:08] <Gho5t> BillCriswell: sorry my jquery is a little rusty...Is this the right way to create a "disable" function I can call on my custom radio buttons? $('.custom-input-radio input').bind('disable', function(){ ... });
[10:13:26] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: That's the right way. Something else must be weird with your code. Quick example: http://jsfiddle.net/SeKtt/
[10:15:08] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Yeah, then .trigger('disable')
[10:17:42] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: So I use a standard selector in prependTo, so #modal should be fine?
[10:17:58] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: Yeah, doc says it could be a selector.
[10:18:17] <scriptraptor> is there a better method than prependTo I could try?
[10:19:07] <BillCriswell> $body.prepend($foo) or $foo.prependTo($body)
[10:19:15] <BillCriswell> I think you're looking at the wrong problem though
[10:19:53] <scriptraptor> can I use prependTo with a jq obj?
[10:20:01] <anonymus_> @jason: thnq for helping
[10:20:03] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:20:24] <anonymus_> istill dint get the output.will try .thnq again.
[10:20:30] <anonymus_> @jason
[10:21:18] <BillCriswell> anonymus_: You should try typing jason then a tab. It'll complete the nick and he'll be notified properly.
[10:22:10] <jrist> haha thank you BillCriswell
[10:23:08] <jrockjiggz> every time i try to type jason my fingers type json
[10:23:23] <tintin> Anybody ?
[10:24:01] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: I have lots of weird quirks like that. Can't type "temple" without typing "template" first.
[10:24:11] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72104/
[10:24:27] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72104/ , is there any wrong with this code, it's not adding class for anchor
[10:24:30] <tintin> why?
[10:24:38] <BillCriswell> I also can't type "clone" properly the first time. I always type "clonde".
[10:25:39] <BillCriswell> tintin: It's not adding anything till it's clicked.
[10:25:44] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72105/ ,anything wrong with this code, it's not adding class
[10:25:54] <tintin> I have clicked that anchor
[10:26:10] <jason_day> I was using qtip2 on a project, and it was still unusable for a production environment - memory leaks, etc.
[10:26:25] <BillCriswell> tintin: $('a[href=' + window.location.pathname + ']').addClass('selected')
[10:26:38] <BillCriswell> Oh, I see.
[10:27:50] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: i _ALWAYS_ forget ; its very annoying
[10:27:56] <jason_day> it's even better that my last name is day - json_data
[10:28:23] <BillCriswell> I pronounce data as "day-ta" haha.
[10:28:45] <jason_day> that should really be my moniker for irc, and on the net in general
[10:28:45] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: I do on line liners as well.
[10:30:57] <BillCriswell> I do on one liners as well*
[10:34:54] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: whats worse, i use F12 to switch files, right beside that key is the 'airplane mode' hotkey.. kills all internet.. damn you samsung...
[10:35:10] <tintin> BillCriswell: Then do i have to run this for loop? $('ul#id_ul_nav li a').each(function() {
[10:35:52] <BillCriswell> My power button is right above my delete key, luckily I have to hold it for like a half second to work... Can you put some kind of delay on the airplane mode button?
[10:36:09] <BillCriswell> tintin: Nope.
[10:36:23] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72108/ , is that correct? still not working
[10:37:00] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/8KllCjKpjJog7PjdprcW/
[10:37:03] <tintin> BillCriswell: ^
[10:37:30] <tintin> http://bpaste.net/show/72111/
[10:37:32] <tintin> BillCriswell: ^
[10:38:39] <BillCriswell> tintin: Just saying "not working" doesn't help. You don't need to run the loop or put it in a click event.
[10:40:10] <tintin> BillCriswell: still not, http://bpaste.net/show/72112/
[10:41:08] <BillCriswell> tintin: http://jsbin.com/utajut/1/edit
[10:41:24] <BillCriswell> tintin: Clicking an a is going to follow the link.
[10:41:27] <oliwe> crap
[10:41:29] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: prependTo seems to be affected by $modal.load(link);
[10:41:37] <oliwe> draggable and resizable combined is bugged in chrome
[10:42:15] <oliwe> i use chrome at work but ff at home
[10:42:24] <oliwe> so i came home and was like "oh shit it solved itself this is awesome"
[10:43:00] <BillCriswell> "Best Viewed in FF"
[10:43:15] <oliwe> haha
[10:43:24] <oliwe> i wont go that low
[10:43:26] <jrockjiggz> oliwe: happened to me the other day.. i agree..
[10:43:44] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: why is it if I swap .load to $modal.get(link, function() { $modal.prepend(/*stuff*/); } )} it works?
[10:44:07] <scriptraptor> does .load overwrite once the DOM is loaded or something?
[10:44:08] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: async.
[10:44:10] <tintin> BillCriswell: Why didn't you add this line? $('a').click(function(){
[10:44:18] <oliwe> now im trying to figure out a bunch of math problems
[10:44:18] <tintin> BillCriswell: What's wrong adding this line? $('a').click(function(){
[10:44:35] <oliwe> im making my draggable resizable object have a slider, except the slider doesnt understand containment
[10:44:38] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: I don't understand why that would cause this difference though D:
[10:44:48] <oliwe> so it will resize stuff even if you are on the edge of the containment
[10:44:53] <oliwe> me so sad
[10:45:14] <BillCriswell> tintin: If you're clicking a link you're going to go to that link.
[10:45:43] <BillCriswell> If you do $('a').click(function(){ // This will work, but won't effect the page that's loaded... });
[10:46:39] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: When you do $('.foo').load(link); the rest of the code runs regardless of if link is finished loading.
[10:46:54] <Mrgoose> Hello, I have a question regarding jquery and jquery mobile.  I have a jquery script that I use along with jquery mobile.  The problem is that on the initial page load the jquery item doesn't seem to work, however when i refresh the page it does work
[10:46:57] <scriptraptor> right, so it's overwriting what i'm doing?
[10:47:09] <BillCriswell> You would want to do $('.foo').load(link, function(){ // All Done, now I can fuck around with the HTML that was loaded });
[10:47:10] <tintin> BillCriswell: But anything wrong adding this line? $('a').click(function(){
[10:47:17] <BillCriswell> tintin: No.
[10:47:19] <json_data> mtgs and such - tell anon I left :D
[10:47:35] <BillCriswell> Haha, will do json_data.
[10:47:40] <scriptraptor> are there any big differences with .get and .load?
[10:47:57] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: Almost the same thing.
[10:48:11] <json_data> no difference, just wrappers for the ajax method
[10:48:16] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: *almost*?
[10:48:33] <BillCriswell> $.get(link, function(result){ $foo.html(result); }); is just about $foo.load(link);
[10:48:57] <BillCriswell> There may be little details involved I'm not sure on, but essentially.
[10:49:05] <tintin> BillCriswell: But this doesn't work: http://bpaste.net/show/72116/
[10:49:07] <tintin> why?
[10:49:43] <BillCriswell> tintin: When you click the link you go to a new page. The script that ran on that click would effect the new page.
[10:49:46] <jrockjiggz> $.load is the same concept as $.get(), but allows you to load the content into a selected element easily.
[10:49:56] <json_data> @tintin, you may want to use .delegate or .on instead
[10:50:34] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: so get is if you want the contents, load is to get and output contents?
[10:50:48] <tintin> BillCriswell: But i don't see that effect in new page
[10:51:01] <tintin> BillCriswell: How can i get the effect to the new page
[10:51:02] <tintin> ?
[10:52:10] <BillCriswell> tintin: http://jsbin.com/utajut/1/edit the first thing I posted to you. If you only want to put a "selected" class on the active page do this.
[10:52:54] <tintin> BillCriswell: Yes, that works, but my question is how can i do the same thing with $('a').click ?
[10:53:43] <tintin> BillCriswell: That adds the class, but the CSS rule is cross-lined in firebug or it has no effect, why?
[10:54:11] <tintin> .selected { color: blue;
[10:54:12] <tintin> }
[10:54:34] <tintin> but this rule is cancelled/nullified
[10:55:02] <BillCriswell> tintin: There's a more specific selector declaring that property.
[10:55:19] <xec_> tintin: some other css rule is overruling the color property, perhaps?
[10:56:38] <tintin> BillCriswell: Ah, yes, that works now
[10:56:45] <tintin> some other rule was overriding it
[10:58:38] <Mrgoose> Any clue why this only loads on a refresh ?  http://mobile.vi-dev.net/thermostat  when you first go there the jquery script doesn't seem to fire
[11:01:05] <json_data> @goose - initially, the page hadn't finished loading
[11:01:19] <json_data> however, opening a new tab and retrying it, seemed to work fine
[11:02:16] <Mrgoose> correct, any ideas on how to fix that?
[11:03:09] <tintin> BillCriswell: But if i add this event check : $('a').click(function() {
[11:03:17] <json_data> worked correctly in FF
[11:03:33] <json_data> on first load/try
[11:03:36] <tintin> BillCriswell: Then it add this class and i can see the effect for very little time, but the next page has no effect of this
[11:03:42] <tintin> BillCriswell: Why? what to do?
[11:03:57] <json_data> tintin - are you trying to get one page's event to pass to another page?
[11:03:58] <tintin> BillCriswell: If i want to do the same with checking click event, how can i do it?
[11:04:04] <tintin> json_data: Yes
[11:04:10] <terrance> Hi, i'm using a jquery ui datepicker inside a jquery ui dialog... When I click the date field, the datepicker shows, but when then pressing cancel while the datepicker is still open, next time the dialog opens, the datepicker still shows open by default... It needs to always be hidden and only open when clicked in the date textbox... any way to do this?
[11:04:20] <json_data> javascript doesn't maintain frmo page to page
[11:04:29] <json_data> it doesn't naturally pass data
[11:04:32] <json_data> a new page is a new page
[11:04:40] <Mrgoose> json_data, tried in FF, and safari
[11:04:52] <tintin> json_data: BillCriswell CAn't javascript pass the event from one to the next page?
[11:05:14] <json_data> there are various things you can do, however you can't expect a new page to remember what you clicked on the last page without coding for it
[11:05:35] <json_data> you can set a cookie, use html5 storage, etc.
[11:05:38] <terrance> Why does nobody ever reply in here?
[11:05:42] <BillCriswell> tintin: Are you just trying to highlight the active page?
[11:05:48] <terrance> is my question that difficult?
[11:05:49] <tintin> BillCriswell: Yes
[11:05:52] <matthewgonzalez> terrance: you could add an "on click" event to the dialog "close" button that hides the datepicker
[11:06:14] <terrance> ok
[11:06:17] <BillCriswell> tintin: Just put $('a[href="' + window.location.pathname + '"]').addClass('selected'); at the top of it. Simple as that.
[11:06:27] <BillCriswell> No reason for a click.
[11:06:38] <tintin> BillCriswell: Your example works nice, but i was trying/testing with $('a').click()
[11:06:49] <json_data> why do you need the click, tintin?
[11:06:54] <tintin> BillCriswell: But if i test with click, how to do it?
[11:06:56] <json_data> if you put Bill's code on each page it will work
[11:07:05] <dankest> How can I append html to a page without the JS getting stripped out?
[11:07:10] <json_data> however, you can't pass the click to the next page without coding for it
[11:07:15] <dankest> I'm using .html(), but it kills my JS
[11:07:26] <terrance> Thx Matthew
[11:07:40] <json_data> @dankest - .append
[11:07:53] <matthewgonzalez> do you need me to do a simple fiddle or do you think you have it, terrance?
[11:07:59] <BillCriswell> tintin: So you want to add the class "selected" to the CURRENT page when any link on the page is clicked?
[11:08:25] <oliwe> wat r u guys doin
[11:08:32] <oliwe> putting javascript in page with javascript
[11:08:43] <oliwe> stahp
[11:08:55] <tintin> BillCriswell: What you did with your example is correct. $('a[href="' + window.location.pathname + '"]').addClass('selected');
[11:09:07] <json_data> @oliwe - agreed, but sometimes someone needs to
[11:09:10] <terrance> Matthew: this doesn't do the trick: $( "#datepicker-edit" ).datepicker("hide"); :(
[11:09:12] <tintin> BillCriswell: Is that possible to do the same after clicking that link
[11:09:28] <matthewgonzalez> let me make a little jsfiddle for you terrance
[11:09:29] <BillCriswell> tintin: It is essentially doing that.
[11:09:29] <oliwe> are you guys all frontend developers? cause i find myself do frontend stuff with backend coding even if it would be better to use frontend stuff like js
[11:09:29] <json_data> @terrance, did you put that in the dialog close event?
[11:09:31] <matthewgonzalez> give me a sec
[11:09:34] <tintin> Is there any option with datepicker to add/pick hour,minute,second too?
[11:09:41] <terrance> yes, in the close event and in the cancel event
[11:09:43] <tintin> BillCriswell: I know that is doing that.
[11:10:11] <BillCriswell> The click is completely useless in your case.
[11:10:55] <json_data> @Bill, I don't think he knows how to explain what he's looking for
[11:11:21] <terrance> If I destroy the datepicker, it's gone, but then it's gone too when the dialog is opened next time
[11:11:26] <tintin> json_data: BillCriswell Yes, that is something like passing click event of anchor to the next page
[11:12:01] <json_data> @matthew, can we see your full close event
[11:12:17] <json_data> sorry - terrance
[11:12:25] <terrance> ok
[11:12:43] <json_data> @tintin, you can't pass the click event to the next page
[11:12:51] <terrance> Here's the whole dialog function: http://pastebin.com/FS6gwG3f
[11:12:51] <json_data> without setting a cookie, storage, etc.
[11:14:11] <tintin> json_data: Ok, i understand what you are saying, thank you
[11:15:49] <json_data> terrance, just for good measure - is your datepicker selector correct?
[11:16:05] <idletask> OK, 2 hours more of research and I cannot get a simple qtip2 tooltip to work :( how can this --> https://raw.github.com/fge/json-schema-validator-demo/master/src/main/webapp/site.js <-- be converted to qTip2?
[11:16:58] <idletask> (other link: https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator-demo/blob/master/src/main/webapp/site.js#L143 and see the main() function also, which is called on document.ready()
[11:17:31] <json_data> terrance - possible solutions
[11:17:32] <json_data> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/932420/jquery-ui-datepicker-opens-automatically-within-dialog
[11:17:41] <json_data> @idle - qtip2 is still beta
[11:17:44] <json_data> and buggy
[11:17:46] <terrance> thx!
[11:18:06] <NoiseEee> idletask: that being said, there's no doubt thousands of tooltip jquery libs
[11:18:59] <idletask> Yes, I have been guided to two of them on this very channel, one of them was qtip and the other was tiptip
[11:19:12] <BillCriswell> I like qtiptip
[11:19:16] <json_data> i use tipsy, myself
[11:19:23] <BillCriswell> qtiptip2
[11:19:38] <BillCriswell> 2.alpha
[11:19:40] <Mrgoose> json_data, if i remove the jquery mobile js it works fine, however with the jquery mobile script i have to load the page then refresh for it to work
[11:19:44] <BillCriswell> I should just go home right now.
[11:21:07] <idletask> OK, OK, wait -- I am just looking for a plugin which is able to display, on mouseover, a simple text content, and "forget" it (ie, hide and/or destroy) on mouseleave, or whatever the canonical events are called
[11:21:28] <idletask> Bear in mind, I am an HTML/CSS/JS newbie
[11:21:37] <json_data> tipsy
[11:21:42] <idletask> With all these factors taken into account, what do you think is best?
[11:21:42] <BillCriswell> idletask: title="A small, yellow tooltip"
[11:21:57] <json_data> +1 for Bill
[11:22:14] <idletask> BillCriswell: builtin browser popups are poor
[11:22:30] <json_data> not really, they are the most "accessible"
[11:22:45] <json_data> and smallest, best performing
[11:22:52] <json_data> and don't fail
[11:22:53] <json_data> ever
[11:22:55] <idletask> Yes, but they will be displayed like the browser wants it, not like I want
[11:23:09] <idletask> I have a (CSS) style on the site
[11:23:12] <BillCriswell> How dare the OS have any say over a UI element.
[11:23:22] <json_data> what style are you going for?
[11:23:24] <idletask> OK, I'll have a look at tipsy
[11:23:28] <json_data> speech bubble like?
[11:23:31] <NoiseEee> "funky but elegant"
[11:23:45] <BillCriswell> All joking aside, tipsy looks nice.
[11:23:46] <idletask> json_data: no, plain, readable text
[11:24:01] <json_data> plain = browser default
[11:24:19] <idletask> By plain I mean the content will only be text
[11:27:07] <json_data> i understand, as someone that does this sort of thing full time, default to the browser when you can
[11:27:11] <json_data> simple is better
[11:27:18] <json_data> however, if you must - tipsy
[11:28:45] <idletask> OK, have a look here: http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com -- in the schema array, type {}, and in the data area, copy paste that: https://gist.github.com/raw/4597552/aed0d27f896d8fd1da5be021106543905699c0ae/samples.json
[11:29:03] <idletask> When you click validate, the data in the second link contains an error
[11:29:49] <idletask> The link will do two things: 1. on a mouseover, display a tooltip describing the error, 2. on click, take you to the actual place where the parser failed
[11:30:00] <idletask> Right now, the tooltip is handled using qtip1
[11:30:24] <idletask> If tipsy is easier to use, I'll go for it any day
[11:30:29] <json_data> much easier
[11:31:22] <idletask> OK, I'll google about it then
[11:31:49] <idletask> Thanks for the tip... err, name
[11:33:58] <terrance> is the "close" event in a dialog fired on all occassions when the dialog disappears?
[11:34:26] <json_data> @terrance, as long as you are actually closing it and not using css to hide it
[11:35:19] <terrance> The solution on that site destroys the datepicker
[11:35:30] <terrance> it doesn't appear anymore next time I open the dialog :(
[11:36:16] <json_data> right, you would re-initialize it each time
[11:36:21] <json_data> also you could try beforeClose
[11:37:10] <json_data> and/or change the function to close: function( event, ui ) {}
[11:37:24] <terrance> oh right, forgot that
[11:41:30] <terrance> btw, why does he use the find(ui) thing? Can't he just use the selector directly like $("mydatepicker").
[11:43:21] <json_data> he's initiating the datepicker from within the open function and adding a click event, not sure he needs the find
[11:43:50] <json_data> would only make sense if it was a class, but not an id
[11:45:41] <mongag> http://jsfiddle.net/JjMs4/ what to do so when I click on checkbox to add css style for the current table row ?
[11:46:22] <mongag> here - http://jsfiddle.net/JjMs4/3/
[11:54:23] <json_data> @mongag - http://jsfiddle.net/jasonday/JjMs4/4/
[11:56:52] <mongag> thanks
[11:58:07] <Forbidd3n> anyone know of an example that used the accordion and after form submit response from server switches to next step?
[11:58:46] <json_data> @forb - we had to write on of those and it got really complicated
[11:58:54] <json_data> needed a whole controller object, etc.
[11:59:17] <json_data> you could do it with the ajax call
[11:59:31] <json_data> so submit form with ajax, on success go to next step
[11:59:47] <Forbidd3n> json_data: that is what I am trying to do
[12:00:00] <Forbidd3n> I guess I can select accoridion slide after validation
[12:00:03] <Forbidd3n> and respinse
[12:00:07] <Forbidd3n> response
[12:00:46] <json_data> that would be the easiest
[12:01:22] <scriptraptor> it is better to do: $('<div id="bar"></div>').prependTo('#foo'); $my_new_jq = $('#bar'); --- than --- $my_new_jq = $('<div id="bar"></div>').prependTo('#foo'); ? because each time I use $my_new_jq it would be running .prependTo()  also, right?
[12:02:40] <json_data> right
[12:02:53] <json_data> but do you need to reuse #bar?
[12:05:53] <tfitts> just out of curiousity, what terrible thing would have happened if you had run it both ways and seen what it did?
[12:06:50] <json_data> well anytime you reused the var $my_new_jq, it would append another id of #bar, so you woul dhave multiple elements with the same id
[12:07:58] <tfitts> no, I know what it would have actually done to his program.  I just mean why ask what would happen instead of actually trying for yourself.  It probably took as long to write out the question as it would have to try it both ways.
[12:08:23] <scriptraptor> json_data: yeah i'm possibly manipulating with .load, or .width etc
[12:09:06] <scriptraptor> tfitts: an event handler didn't work, that's when i realised what i did
[12:09:35] <eni> after doing something like $(object).css({'color':red});
[12:09:42] <tfitts> oic
[12:09:46] <eni> how can i undo it? (ie set color to default)
[12:10:44] <dogmatic69> Hi all, I just tried out 1.9 and seems $('.class_name') does not work the same as before?
[12:11:01] <tfitts> dogmatic69: it's something else.
[12:11:12] <dogmatic69> it returns [selector: ".buy-now", context: document, jquery: "1.9.0", constructor: function, init: function]
[12:11:32] <dogmatic69> tfitts: is there some guide as to the changes?
[12:11:38] <scriptraptor> eni: that's a logic question isn't it? pass in the default as a variable or use the css inherit value
[12:11:56] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ dogmatic69
[12:12:21] <eni> scriptraptor: i dont know the default the moment, i was thinking something as "remove color:red}
[12:13:42] <dogmatic69> tfitts: I mentions about html, not seeing anything about class selectors.
[12:13:48] <BillCriswell> This is the slowest day I've ever lived through.
[12:13:49] <Randomage> Allright. I tried not asking people for help, but I can't do it apparently. How the heck can I animate background position?
[12:13:58] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: :(
[12:14:00] <nocturne7> is anyone familiar with highcharts here ?
[12:14:13] <tfitts> nocturne7: I use them.
[12:14:36] <nocturne7> tfitts, I am trying to remove the connecting lines here http://jsfiddle.net/gFcXH/7/
[12:14:38] <tfitts> eni: you don't need ot know the default, you update with inherit
[12:14:39] <hugo_moss> cant get font-face to work in ie7, i have the bulletproof font method, but it wont load, and firebug lite 1.3 wont load either,
[12:14:43] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: maybe you are time travelling slower than everyone else, you should call stephen hawking (this should pass the time, ironically)
[12:14:49] <hugo_moss> wtf
[12:14:53] <nocturne7> I am having difficulty finding the option to remove the lines,  I just want dots to appear
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> I'm still blown away by his little computer.
[12:15:14] <BillCriswell> I should read up about that.
[12:15:19] <scriptraptor> there's a TED talk he did
[12:15:20] <scriptraptor> it's good
[12:15:31] <scriptraptor> not too long, about 10 min
[12:15:40] <eni> tfitts: how?
[12:15:56] <scriptraptor> color:red ---> color:inherit;
[12:16:55] <tfitts> nocturne7: it sounds like you want a scatter plot instead of a line chart
[12:17:54] <dizzyone> hello, I extended the array.prototype with these 2 functions: http://jsbin.com/ibowap/1/edit - I was wondering if this is useful, smart and if so, how I should name them better
[12:17:58] <dizzyone> not sure if reposting is frowned upon, but just looking for some feedback, ##javascript no one responded
[12:18:28] <scriptraptor> you'll get a better answer in js and short answer is prototyping the DOM is bad
[12:18:59] <nocturne7> tfitts, I am actually trying to get it to look similiar to this this http://awesomescreenshot.com/016u3nr2a
[12:19:20] <dizzyone> scriptraptor, do you know a resource that explains it? I tried subclassing but it didn't seem to work at all
[12:19:41] <scriptraptor> why not just wrap your toolbox?
[12:20:16] <scriptraptor> instead of array.method you then use toolbox.array.method
[12:20:21] <scriptraptor> and avoid prototype
[12:20:22] <dizzyone> not sure if you're replying to me, I don't quite understand what you mean :S
[12:20:27] <tfitts> nocturne7: that looks like a scatter plot with an average line
[12:20:34] <dizzyone> hmmm
[12:20:43] <nocturne7> tfitts, that's correct
[12:21:05] <dizzyone> I'll try that, thanks :)
[12:21:17] <scriptraptor> dizzyone: i'd still wait for an answer in javascript
[12:21:37] <dizzyone> alright, just trying to improve :)
[12:22:28] <dizzyone> I think I read somewhere it's bad to prototype the base objects, but I really can't get subclassing to work >_<
[12:23:02] <nocturne7> tfitts, do you know if this is possible with highcarts?
[12:23:58] <tfitts> http://www.highcharts.com/demo/combo-regression
[12:25:14] <nocturne7> tfitts, thanks, that's exactly what I am looking for
[12:27:20] <Mrgoose> I have a plugin that's built for jquery but i want to implement in jquery mobile site.  do i need to modify the plugin to auto init on pagecreate or something? because currently the plugin only loads after i do a refresh on the page
[12:27:39] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:34:35] <velcrobots> trying to use closest() and siblings() so when clicking a section in this menu, the other previously expanded section collapses and becomes inactive - http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/B6d35/
[12:34:40] <tfitts> nocturne7: no problem.
[12:35:38] <ravenzz> velcrobots somethink like an accordion?
[12:36:00] <velcrobots> ravenzz sort of.
[12:36:14] <velcrobots> can't get the other section to collapse
[12:41:49] <ravenzz> velcrobots more or less http://jsfiddle.net/B6d35/7/
[12:45:36] <velcrobots> ravenzz wow, sweet.  now how do I implement this?  in other words, what part of my docready stuff do I get rid of?  i just need this accordion thing to also add/remove the "mk-selected" class
[12:46:10] <ravenzz> wait here is a little improvement http://jsfiddle.net/B6d35/9/
[12:48:34] <ravenzz> jsfiddle is so damn slow -.-
[12:48:41] <oliwe> yeah i noticed
[12:49:01] <scriptraptor> TIL that doing something by accident like <form /></form> confuses jquery
[12:49:05] <oliwe> im trying to calculate something i cant calculate
[12:49:08] <oliwe> feels bad
[12:49:14] <oliwe> shouldve gone to math more
[12:50:52] <ravenzz> velcrobots http://jsbin.com/unenoj/1/edit
[12:52:36] <velcrobots> ravenzz: awesome, thanks.  seems to work fine.  so this is a separate function?  not part of my docready stuff?
[12:53:16] <ravenzz> $(function () {}) is a shortcut for $(document).ready()
[12:53:37] <velcrobots> oh ok
[12:53:40] <ravenzz> the outer one is good for you. basically it wraps your code
[12:54:01] <ravenzz> and it is executed immediately
[12:54:15] <ravenzz> ?scope @ velcrobots
[12:54:31] <ravenzz> uhm don't we have a bot anymore?
[12:55:05] <ravenzz> velcrobots join #javascript and hit `scope and `iife
[12:55:12] <velcrobots> ok
[12:55:25] <danheberden> or google "benalman iife"
[12:55:39] <ravenzz> I read bananaman lool
[12:55:59] <velcrobots> think i am screwing this up though when trying to put in with rest of js code: http://pastebin.com/qw7Hb1JD
[12:56:22] <danheberden> though b-ot should be in here
[12:56:29] <danheberden> b-ot are you here?
[12:56:29] <b-ot> danheberden, it is certain.
[12:56:33] <velcrobots> oh crap wait
[12:56:35] <danheberden> hey buddy
[12:56:37] <velcrobots> duh i left the rest in
[12:56:38] <danheberden> `iife
[12:56:57] <danheberden> b-ot: i thought you had these factoids
[12:57:15] <ravenzz> the old trigger was ?
[12:57:26] <danheberden> yeah, but bot-t is pretty unreliable
[12:57:40] <ravenzz> ehhe
[12:57:54] <danheberden> `iife
[12:57:54] <b-ot> danheberden, http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

[13:00:13] <ravenzz> actually ` is the #css trigger, on #javascript is ! iirc
[13:00:32] <ravenzz> <o>
[13:00:32] <velcrobots> ravenzz i'm lost here.  how do i add this function you wrote to the rest if my code?

[13:02:19] <Eviltwin> </o>
[13:02:55] <oliwe> haha i just solved something that i was suppose to do all week at work
[13:03:33] <jklaus> nice oliwe
[13:06:14] <oliwe> jklaus its very nice considering ive done javascript for about 3 days
[13:06:31] <jklaus> lol

[13:06:37] <oliwe> this is where im at right now
[13:07:05] <oliwe> when you move it you can see the horizontal limit on the slider: thingy
[13:07:09] <oliwe> how many % left there are
[13:07:24] <oliwe> that its able to increase
[13:07:41] <oliwe> just need to do it on vertical and use math.low
[13:07:42] <oliwe> voila
[13:07:48] <oliwe> something else
[13:10:17] <velcrobots> ravenzz just a little more help?!?!
[13:12:38] <MrPunkin> Okay guys… the site I'm working on has an event listener bound to window resize from Prototype. Is there a way I can trigger this from a jQuery plugin? Trying jQuery(window).trigger('resize') doesn't seem to work.
[13:13:20] <noregret> oliwe: you're aware that nobody can see the link you posted as it is your localhost.. right ?
[13:13:57] <oliwe> oh
[13:13:58] <oliwe> lol
[13:14:00] <oliwe> sorry
[13:14:14] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org:81/craft2/
[13:15:50] <dogmatic69> I cant get a simple selector to work. jQuery is returning something strange.. http://bin.cakephp.org/view/435157440
[13:15:55] <dogmatic69> anyone know what is going on?
[13:16:01] <oliwe> on that note i just realized my calculation is wrong because i need to use the current percentage aswell but after some tweaking it'll work
[13:16:52] <ravenzz> velcrobots sorry I have to go
[13:17:07] <velcrobots> doh.  cheers, thx for the help!
[13:17:33] <ravenzz> you're welcome.. see you
[13:17:45] <shoky> dogmatic69:  we need to see the html too
[13:18:08] <shoky> dogmatic69: that selector should find <a class="buy-now">
[13:18:33] <dogmatic69> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/480904137
[13:18:40] <dogmatic69> shoky: and it is
[13:18:42] <shoky> dogmatic69: but there's nothing strange there, it just didnt find any matching element
[13:18:57] <dogmatic69> shoky: normally it would be []
[13:19:13] <dogmatic69> I have not see this output and been using jquery for a few years :/
[13:19:36] <shoky> dogmatic69: the console can show you extra stuff
[13:19:59] <shoky> and it changes all the time.. so it doesnt matter how long youve been doin anything
[13:20:52] <MrPunkin> Can anyone help me with my jQuery / Prototype event observing issue?
[13:20:57] <shoky> dogmatic69: anyway that's how a jquery object "really" looks like
[13:23:27] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: two libraries, you say
[13:23:37] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: just ask
[13:23:53] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: I did
[13:24:05] <NoiseEee> ask your question, don't ask if anyone can help.
[13:24:10] <MrPunkin> I did
[13:24:14] <dogmatic69> shoky: ah, so chrome has changed then..
[13:24:18] <NoiseEee> ahh didnt see it MrPunkin
[13:24:20] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: I have a handler bound to window resize in Prototype and am hoping to find a way to trigger it from a jQuery script.
[13:24:49] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: Without having to re-initialize the prototype 'class' that handles the function.
[13:25:17] <dogmatic69> $('a.add-to-cart') is correct for <a href="#" class="add-to-cart btn btn-info">Add to basket</a>
[13:25:18] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: that might be unpossible, trigger() will only go through jquery added events
[13:25:21] <NoiseEee> afaik
[13:25:55] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: can you not fire it from prototype?
[13:26:02] <shoky> dogmatic69:  is your code in a $(document).ready handler, are you sure those elements are in the DOM when you're calling $(..) ?
[13:26:14] <dogmatic69> shoky: its in a .js file
[13:26:23] <dogmatic69> still required?
[13:26:35] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: This is a jQuery script I'm working on as the site will eventually move to jQuery… and prototype offers no way to fire native events.
[13:26:37] <shoky> yes, if it's in the <head>
[13:26:45] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: it can
[13:26:59] <dogmatic69> shoky: ah...
[13:27:07] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: how? http://prototypejs.org/doc/latest/dom/Element/fire/
[13:27:14] <dogmatic69> I am building some ebay stuff so its not in the head...
[13:27:17] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: only custom events, not native ones like 'resize'
[13:27:24] <dogmatic69> first time loading jquery in the body :D
[13:27:28] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: http://benjchristensen.com/2010/08/28/trigger-native-javascript-events-with-prototype-js/
[13:27:44] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: also i've used something called 'event-simulate.js' plugged in / added to prototype.js, just can't seem to find source online
[13:27:55] <shoky> dogmatic69:  then it should be at the end of body
[13:28:36] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: Ah. I might as well simply assign a custom event though here and trigger it via prototype if I'm already going through the work of finding how to trigger 'resize'.
[13:28:38] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: http://code.google.com/p/protolicious/source/browse/trunk/src/event.simulate.js?r=30 i think
[13:28:44] <dogmatic69> shoky: ye, just moved the .js includes to the bottom and wrapped the code in document ready stuff.
[13:28:48] <dogmatic69> Seems to work now.
[13:28:52] <dogmatic69> thanks shoky
[13:29:05] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: yeah either way you just won't be able to fire a prototype observer via jQuery afaik
[13:29:07] <shoky> dogmatic69:  i think if its in <body> at the end then its better not to have document.ready
[13:29:33] <shoky> dogmatic69: ie might barf at it, or so  i hear
[13:29:59] <shoky> or, trigger the dom.ready event before the listener was registered
[13:30:08] <MrPunkin> NoiseEee: this could all be solved if there was a way to bind my prototype class ( a sticky footer ) to run every time the DOM content changes, but my understanding is there are no DOM change events that will be sticking around.
[13:33:55] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: haven't used it myself, but afaik this is a nice hack for listening to DOM content changes: http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion
[13:34:32] <NoiseEee> MrPunkin: i guess thats specifically for DOM node insertions though.  peek at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/School_tutorial/Appendix_F:_Monitoring_DOM_changes as well
[13:35:31] <shoky> if you control the prototype code.. a custom event really seems like the way to go, at least until you finish the move
[13:35:38] <mononofu> so I have a weird problem with $.get('myurl')
[13:35:43] <mononofu> if served from my desktop it works
[13:35:58] <mononofu> if served from my raspberry pi and called from chrome's dev console it works
[13:36:11] <jrockjiggz> mononofu: http://enable-cors.org/
[13:36:16] <mononofu> but if served from my raspberry pi and called by $(document).ready() it doesn't
[13:36:31] <mononofu> no, it's calling the same server
[13:36:35] <jrockjiggz> ok
[13:36:40] <mononofu> as in '/async/status'
[13:37:06] <mononofu> but it reports a 404
[13:37:18] <mononofu> 'GET http://wien.furidamu.org/async/nas 404 (Not Found) '
[13:37:23] <jrockjiggz> 404 means you have received a response
[13:37:58] <mononofu> but if I visit this manually I get 200, and I can see the request handled by my webserver (and it's not a 404)
[13:38:59] <jrockjiggz> mononofu: maybe this can help http://jsfiddle.net/reigel/RafuW/
[13:39:26] <mononofu> jrockjiggz: thanks, I'll try it
[13:41:08] <vinmassaro> I'm trying to apply a ligature script to all headings, but when I have an image or an anchor inside a heading, the script applies to those elements as well, messing up their output. How can I apply it to all headings but not their child elements?
[13:43:26] <jrockjiggz> vinmassaro: i find excluding quotes helps.. example data-title=hello
[13:43:43] <jrockjiggz> hmm
[13:44:08] <jrockjiggz> vinmassaro: sorry, maybe i misunderstood
[13:44:30] <vinmassaro> jrockjiggz: hmm, not sure what you mean. My selector right now looks something like $(':header') to get all headers, but it's applying the script to images and links INSIDE headers
[13:51:38] <mononofu> jrockjiggz: well, I don't know why jquery doesn't work, but if I do a manual XMLHttpRequest it works fine.
[13:58:30] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Just be more specific with your selectors.
[14:00:20] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: something like $(':header:not(:has(a,img))') unfortunately sort of works but excludes those headers containing an image…I still want to select those, I just don't want my script applied to those images or link elements.
[14:04:13] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Can you put a span around the text and just apply it to that?
[14:13:56] <oliwe> anyone else feel like they get high while coding and something works
[14:14:19] <oliwe> i cant continue working cause im too happy
[14:14:21] <wolfgang42> oliwe: Definitely :)
[14:14:38] <wolfgang42> Especially when it's a bug I've been trying to track down for days
[14:14:43] <BillCriswell> I get suspicious if it works well the first time.
[14:14:46] <oliwe> oh
[14:14:50] <oliwe> this is a bug i tracked down in
[14:14:55] <oliwe> 20 mins maybe
[14:14:56] <oliwe> :D
[14:15:01] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org:81/craft2/
[14:15:20] <oliwe> code is rape cause ive only coded javascript for a few days
[14:15:23] <oliwe> but it works
[14:15:27] <oliwe> "somehow"
[14:15:47] <oliwe> it'll prolly break once i start making the images dynamic
[14:16:01] <oliwe> but its been coded with that in mind so it might not be that much of a trouble
[14:16:04] * wolfgang42 grins
[14:16:42] <oliwe> breaks on the button thingies
[14:16:47] <oliwe> but i know that
[14:19:20] <TelFiRE> I have solved this problem so many times and every time it's a different thing. My slide toggle is currently jerking about because of margin on the paragraph tags inside it. This is absurd! :(
[14:19:50] <schuranator> is there a css3 fix for jquery's animate? I seen a plugin called transition but it doesn't work for what I'm trying to do. What I'm looking for is if CSS3 is supported it does the same thing as animate and if not it doest he jquery version
[14:19:57] <Forbidd3n> how would I set multiple options with jquery accoridion
[14:19:58] <schuranator> Just to fix my sluggish mobile experience.
[14:20:25] <Forbidd3n> .accordion("option", "icon and event", ...);

[14:21:08] <Forbidd3n> troy; $(document.body).on('event','class or id', function(){...});
[14:21:40] <troy_mccormick> Forbidd3n: Can I have (document.body).on('change', '#id input'.... ?
[14:22:00] <troy_mccormick> $(document.body).on("change", "#cashout input[type=text]", function() {   // isn't working :(
[14:22:02] <TelFiRE> schuranator: have you seen this http://addyosmani.com/blog/css3transitions-jquery/
[14:22:10] <Forbidd3n> troy_mccormick: yeah
[14:22:20] <troy_mccormick> Forbidd3n: ^^
[14:22:23] <Forbidd3n> what errors are you getting?
[14:22:33] <Forbidd3n> create a jsfiddle example
[14:22:44] <troy_mccormick> No errors, just isn't being triggered (I have a console.log($this);)
[14:22:48] <troy_mccormick> jsfiddle forthcoming...
[14:22:52] <TelFiRE> I don't think you really need a plugin for that, just need to put the animation rules on the css and have modernizr running and throw the javascript inside an if($('body').hasClass('css3-transitions') (or whatever the class is called don't know off top of head)
[14:24:28] <troy_mccormick> Forbidd3n: Not sure how to do a jsfiddle with ajax loaded content. It works when I just have input[type=text] after 'change'
[14:25:12] <Forbidd3n> have it do an ajax call to your page
[14:25:16] <idletask> https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator-demo/blob/master/src/main/webapp/site.js#L143 and https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator-demo/blob/master/src/main/webapp/site.js#L166 <-- how do I convert that to use qTip 2.0.1?
[14:25:17] <Forbidd3n> http://www...
[14:25:44] <schuranator> TelFiRe: I looked into this but i'm using an animate function to simulate a slot machine look so I'm not sure how i would do that without using animate.
[14:25:46] <troy_mccormick> The page isn't publically viewable :(
[14:25:47] <popof_> what is the code for setting the selected of a <select id="s1">
[14:26:04] <popof_> using .attr is proper?
[14:26:08] <zim> Hi all. How emulate a click event?
[14:26:27] <TelFiRE> schuranator: well there's nothing that will 'translate' JS to CSS3 if that's what you're saying
[14:26:34] <TelFiRE> you'd have to be able to make the animation in native css3
[14:26:34] <Forbidd3n> popof_: trigger('click')
[14:27:16] <popof_> zim: $.(thing).click(function() { // do stuff });
[14:27:23] <popof_> Forbidd3n: what?
[14:27:24] <popof_> zim: where thing is a selector
[14:27:29] <TelFiRE> with a slot machine I would imagine there's many ways to do it, off the top of my head the first I can think of is to have all the items on one very tall image and just scroll it down really fast, and when it gets to the bottom reset it to the top
[14:27:43] <TelFiRE> but it really depends on the other aspects of your project
[14:28:51] <barryhjames> Having trouble with an ajax contact form. http://jsfiddle.net/Ne37u/ It seems to just erase the form fields, but it doesn't return the success or fail message.
[14:30:16] <Forbidd3n> popof_: sorry wrong person
[14:30:47] <zim> popof_: I would like to triger an events as I had clicked .force_click with a mouse. I am developing a script and it it driving me nuts f5 click action to test.
[14:30:53] <Forbidd3n> zim:  $('.link').trigger('click')
[14:31:05] <popof_> zim: oh yeah go with Forbidd3n s
[14:31:06] <popof_> my b
[14:31:07] <zim> Forbidd3n: TY
[14:31:08] <popof_> misunderstood
[14:31:18] <zim> NP many Thanks
[14:34:06] <jdguzman> Hi all! I have a question and I'm sure I'm just doing something silly.  I'm trying to get the val of a select drop down on change and it just isn't working.
[14:34:19] <paul_irish> TelFiRE: if (Modernizr.csstransitions)
[14:34:34] <paul_irish> the global object exists for these boolean checks. no need to go back to the DOM
[14:34:35] <paul_irish> :)
[14:34:51] <TelFiRE> good to know! I haven't used it much
[14:35:12] <jdguzman> I do $('select').change (function () { alert($('select option:selected').text()); } )
[14:35:15] <Forbidd3n> jdguzman: $('select').change(function(){ alert( $(this).val() ); });
[14:35:21] <jdguzman> and all I get back is the first option
[14:36:15] <jdguzman> Forbidd3n $(this).val() in your example always returns the val of the first option regardless of what I select
[14:36:39] <jdguzman> could it be an issue with the version of jquery we are using?
[14:36:54] <Forbidd3n> jdguzman: can you show me an example?
[14:37:08] <Forbidd3n> what vs of jq are you using?
[14:37:37] <jdguzman> 1.6.4
[14:37:42] <jdguzman> not my choice :(
[14:39:29] <Forbidd3n> jdguzman: works fine with 1.6.4
[14:39:30] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/7rdru/
[14:39:48] <jdguzman> Forbidd3n I don't have a public facing example I can show you at the moment let me see if I can get something up
[14:40:08] <Forbidd3n> jdguzman: I just gave you a working example
[14:41:05] <jdguzman> interesting … I'll have to continue digging
[14:41:18] <MrPunkin> What is the proper way in a jQuery plugin to store that it is currently doing something? Say I want to know if a batch of code is running so I set a variable to test against to prevent triggering an AJAX call multiple times… should that be stored in object data or in a global variable (to the plugin, not true global)
[14:45:30] <gates> I have an array inside of an array, [ {"id":"123", "name":"specialword"}, {"id":"456", "name":"word1"}, {"id":"789", "name":"word2"} ]
[14:45:58] <gates> how do i check if a string is inside name? I assume you would use $.inArray
[14:46:08] <gates> How does $.inArray work with subset arrays
[14:49:45] <jdguzman> Forbidd3n well it was something silly … seems that there was an id collision and that is why it wasn't working.  Thanks for your help … it reassured me that I wasn't going insane
[14:51:12] <Forbidd3n> jdguzman: np
[14:54:11] <gates> How do you search an array in an array for a value?
[14:59:05] <crivera> is it possible to remove a select box when clicked?
[14:59:16] <crivera> $("select").click(... doesn't work
[15:21:10] <mads-> What does $("div", ".foo") do and where can I read about? I can't seem to find the pattern on jQuerys website
[15:21:49] <crivera> mads-: searches for "divs" in ".foo" scope
[15:22:20] <crivera> mads-: http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext
[15:23:26] <mads-> crivera, thank you!
[15:24:17] <coldhead> crivera++
[15:36:28] <gabrieluk> so  $("div", ".foo") would be represented in the css file as:          .foo div {}; ?
[15:37:21] <gabrieluk> crivera
[15:40:26] <crivera> ehh, it's more like, "There's these '.foo' elements in the dom, give me all 'div's in them"
[15:40:32] <crivera> you're just limiting the search
[15:40:38] <crivera> or telling jquery exactly where to look
[15:41:18] <gabrieluk> no, i mean, isn't search for all .foo classess inside all div elements?
[15:41:31] <thujone> .foo div {} is not a terrible way to look at it
[15:42:50] <gabrieluk> k, so jquery swaps the order of .
[15:42:50] <gabrieluk> CSS Specificity?
[15:43:39] <gabrieluk> i mean  $("div", ".foo") and not  $(".foo", "div")
[15:43:55] <MrPunkin> is there an easy selector or filter to check if an object is in the current viewport (visible based on scroll position)?
[15:44:13] <thujone> the 2nd argument is context
[15:44:19] <thujone> you should probably read about it some
[15:44:44] <thujone> it's not changing how css selectors work
[15:44:45] <gabrieluk> ahh, ok, i was trying to read, but that api docs is confusing for me
[15:44:52] <gabrieluk> yup, i got it
[15:45:16] <thujone> a context could be different doms
[15:45:21] <thujone> or it could just be a section of a dom
[15:45:31] <thujone> or it could be a list of nodes, like your example above
[15:47:01] <sunbeam> is .bind deprecated?
[15:47:11] <thujone> no
[15:48:01] <thujone> MrPunkin: there is a :visible filter, but not sure if that's what you want
[15:50:11] <thujone> i don't know of an easy way to know if it's literally visible on screen
[15:51:04] <thujone> you could calculate the viewport size and scrollTop and get the element's x and y position
[15:51:20] <thujone> it'd be a lot of debugging tho
[15:51:27] <gabrieluk> i understand the context now $("input:radio", document.forms[0]); the context argument is more granular than css selectors
[15:52:20] <thirdender> Does anyone know if this should work? http://stackoverflow.com/a/9027537/379160
[15:52:40] <oliwe> general javascript question here
[15:52:41] <oliwe> http://jsfiddle.net/uxdzR/2/
[15:52:50] <oliwe> can i do something like this easy?
[15:53:10] <oliwe> the loadScript does a ton of stuff and has a bunch of variables i want to use for that button
[15:53:51] <gabrieluk> this is jquery         $('#text').text(lolK); -_-
[15:54:06] <oliwe> yeah but
[15:54:09] <oliwe> im in jquery
[15:54:29] <oliwe> it was just an example
[15:54:46] <thujone> thirdender: if what should work? there's a lot of code on the page
[15:55:19] <thirdender> thujone: the link should go to the one answer to the question... it's supposedly a way to stop .load("url")
[15:55:50] <thujone> .unbind() will unbind all events
[15:56:02] <thujone> .unbind('load') should unbind any load events on that element
[15:56:43] <thujone> it won't stop or cancel an existing attempt to load
[15:57:05] <thirdender> thujone: it does seem to work though... I'm not entirely sure why and that's what made me curious...
[15:58:59] <thujone> i guess you can cancel the callback
[15:59:37] <thujone> so you just want to stop trying to load after a certain period of time
[16:01:37] <thujone> you're basically redefining jquery load()
[16:02:07] <thujone> you might run into trouble if you use load() anywhere else in your app
[16:04:06] <thujone> thirdender: i wouldn't recommend doing it that way. the top answer seems more reasonable to me
[16:06:35] <thujone> oliwe: that looks ok, but just make sure you wrap the whole js file in $(document).ready()
[16:07:26] <oliwe> thujone but it doesnt work?
[16:08:31] <thujone> you have to include the jquery library and wrap the js in $(document).ready(function() {})
[16:09:13] <oliwe> do you mean i should stop using loadScript and use document ready instead?
[16:09:38] <oliwe> cause my loadScript is used 3 more times
[16:09:56] <oliwe> ill just make some ugly code
[16:09:58] <thujone> ok, 1 problem is see... "yep" is undefined
[16:11:00] <oliwe> isnt yep what it puts into "tonsOfStuffHere"
[16:11:16] <oliwe> guess i need to do ""
[16:11:54] <thujone> also, you're missing the ending curly brace
[16:12:23] <oliwe> are we looking at the same code?
[16:13:43] <thujone> nm
[16:15:53] <thujone> so you want 'lolk' to get a value from loadScript()
[16:16:17] <oliwe> no i want the onclick button to use a function thats within a function
[16:16:39] <thujone> yeah, but when you call doStuff from the button, you're not actually passing anything
[16:16:48] <oliwe> yeah i know
[16:16:52] <thujone> i don't see how you can do it that way
[16:17:07] <oliwe> i was wondering if there was a way to do it
[16:17:19] <oliwe> but i'll just do another function since its not that much stuff that needs to be copied
[16:17:23] <thujone> when are you calling loadScript()
[16:17:39] <oliwe> as soon as the page loads
[16:17:51] <thujone> but you said it happens at different times
[16:18:08] <oliwe> no i said i use it 3 times
[16:18:11] <oliwe> after eachother
[16:18:30] <thujone> for three different buttons?
[16:18:37] <oliwe> yeah
[16:18:45] <thujone> ok
[16:18:55] <oliwe> actually when im talking it out im realizing how stupid it would be to call a function within a function
[16:19:00] <oliwe> it's much better to put it outside
[16:19:27] <thujone> so you should probably use $('button').each()
[16:20:19] <oliwe> and then call the id from within that?
[16:20:38] <oliwe> id of the button
[16:21:36] <thujone> for each button, you can set the id to the lolk value
[16:22:05] <thujone> and when you click a button, you can grab the ID before you call the function and pass the ID as the argument
[16:33:32] <jrockjiggz> how does jquery pass its context into its callback?
[16:34:02] <jrockjiggz> customFunction( 'command', function(){ $(this) //is null; });
[16:38:25] <zim> Hi all. Firebug question. Is there a way I can step through all the javascript on a page line by line?
[16:38:58] <tw2113> zim, check the script tab
[16:39:15] <tw2113> upper right corner with the arrows
[16:39:24] <tw2113> set your breakpoint then start clicking
[16:39:41] <zim> tw2113: on it how do I drive it.
[16:40:17] <tw2113> chances are you'll use "step into" a lot
[16:41:21] <zim> thats fine I need to find what is making any btn in a bootstrap modal kick me back to the index page
[16:41:39] <thujone> jrockjiggz: inside the 'function()'
[16:41:41] <tw2113> http://www.snook.ca/archives/screencast/firebug-breakpoints
[16:41:54] <zim> tw2113: tw

[16:42:12] <zim> tw2113: TY rather
[16:42:26] <tw2113> ;)
[16:43:23] <theBrettman> is this the right channel for jquery mobile or do they have another channel because I try to click on stuff in a listview and it's impossible to click on a phone!
[16:43:33] <theBrettman> *touch not click
[16:44:43] <theBrettman> it's only on a certain page apparently and only the first one in the list. I think I know why...
[16:45:22] <theBrettman> no way to see on a phone though but I think another element has overflowed over it so that I'm click that element instead of the list item
[16:49:38] <aboudreault> hey, when I do a $.get, why data in my callback a a XMLDocument object? (I load a csv file)
[16:53:47] <zim> Forbidd3n: you in?
[16:54:15] <aaas> i have several divs with data- attributes  values (10.5, 20, 12.4, etc.)  is there a way I can get an array of all these values?
[16:55:42] <zim> aaas: I think you need to use split
[16:56:32] <tds5016> hi. Is it possible to block the .effect() call so that the script waits for it to finish before continuing witht he block of code?
[16:56:45] <tds5016> basically I want to run one effect, then another.
[16:57:05] <aaas> zim sorry im not sure i explained that right...actually these values are spread across multiple divs... 10.5 for one... 11.2 for another, etc
[16:57:16] <zim> tds5016: I think effect has a callback
[16:57:55] <tds5016> gotchya.
[16:59:45] <zim> Is there a #bootstrap for twitter bootstrap?
[17:00:31] <popof_> zim: did ya check?
[17:00:40] <popof_> zim: ##bootstrap
[17:00:44] <coldhead> ##twitter-bootstrap
[17:00:47] <coldhead> thanks, google
[17:00:48] <popof_> oopsies
[17:00:49] <popof_> yeah
[17:01:02] <coldhead> i'm surprised more people don't know about this amazing search engine resource
[17:01:11] <zim> ty should have googled :-)
[17:01:17] <popof_> the fuck is the internet
[17:01:35] <coldhead> please report to central processing
[17:03:09] <someprimetime> bootstrap has it's own room? lol
[17:06:57] <zim> coldhead: could you have a look at this and tell me what is kicking me back to the index page? http://office.tane.co.uk/bridlit2013/index.php?page=festival&year=2012 click the button "this should do nothing"
[17:07:55] <aaas> ok i have an object of 5 divs... http://i.imgur.com/3InoczG.png  ... and I'd like to access 'xposition' of each of these  http://i.imgur.com/3csLizz.png  ... and form an array of them... how would I go about doing this?
[17:08:38] <zim> aaas: not sure how but why there may be a better way
[17:08:59] <aaas> zim a better way?
[17:09:22] <zim> to do what you want to do with the array
[17:09:28] <coldhead> ah zim
[17:09:39] <coldhead> it's a secret of html
[17:09:51] <coldhead> a button in a form without a submit automatically behaves like a submit
[17:09:54] <zim> coldhead: All ears
[17:10:47] <aaas> zim well i dont really need an array, but i need access to each of those to find the smallest and largest values
[17:11:53] <zim> can you give them all the same class loop through them?
[17:12:06] <aaas> zim they all have the same class 'data-point'
[17:12:56] <zim> I think* there is a way to loop through a selector hold on will google it
[17:13:07] <aaas> zim thanks
[17:13:27] <aaas> zim .each()?
[17:13:42] <zim> thats the one
[17:14:16] <aaas> zim ill look into it thanks
[17:15:21] <BillCriswell> aaas: var coords = $('.data-point').map(function(){ return $(this).position().top; });
[17:15:45] <BillCriswell> That'll give you all the top offsets.
[17:16:01] <zim> would guess at $('.'data-point', function(){$(this).data('data-name*')});    *without the data-
[17:16:26] <aaas> BillCriswell zim ill play around with those thanks
[17:16:29] <zim> would guess at $('.data-point', function(){$(this).data('data-name*')});    *without the data-
[17:17:34] <zim> aaas: play with BillCriswell first look more promising :-)
[17:18:04] <zim> just read that back wrong in so many ways :-)
[17:18:20] <aaas> zim well i don't need to find the offsets, I need to take values I already know and make those the values for position
[17:18:42] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: I sent this earlier but wasn't sure if you responded about making my selectors more specific. Had to run.
[17:18:53] <coldhead> hahahah
[17:18:55] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: I ran as well, just got back around.
[17:19:02] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: ah, ok
[17:20:08] <zim> coldhead: back to my Q. How do I stop the button do I add something like type="?"
[17:21:49] <BillCriswell> aaas: You should be able to do like $('div').each(function(idx,el){ $(el).css({left: coords[idx][0], top: coords[idx][1] });
[17:21:57] <coldhead> oh this comet was the only man i loved
[17:22:35] <aaas> BillCriswell thanks ill play with that
[17:23:55] <zim> coldhead: cracked it type="button"
[17:24:35] <coldhead> oh sorry, yes, should have said
[17:24:44] <coldhead> annoying huh
[17:25:20] <zim> coldhead: yes I have been scratching my head+other_parts all night
[17:25:24] <BillCriswell> aaas: http://jsbin.com/ehomof/1/edit should assist a bit!
[17:26:16] <zim> coldhead: Many thanks. Thats one more beer I owe #jquery
[17:27:06] <aaas> BillCriswell thanks!  im not sure if you saw my setup...i think I explained it poorly.  I do need to set positions, but what I need to do is get the positions from the data attribute of a certain class (5 divs)  here is my object array: http://i.imgur.com/3InoczG.png      ....  http://i.imgur.com/3csLizz.png
[17:27:46] <aaas> BillCriswell I want to get xposition from each object and put it in an array (because I need to get the biggest and largest element and do other manipulations)
[17:28:21] <b-lew> is there an easy way to make a plus and minus button in this function? http://pastie.org/5827874
[17:29:44] <BillCriswell> The first thing I posted should work, just use $(this).attr('xposition')
[17:29:59] <BillCriswell> Might be safer to do parseInt($(this).attr('xposition'), 10);
[17:30:11] <BillCriswell> parseFloat() *
[17:30:27] <aaas> BillCriswell ok...ill work on it..i've bothered you enough..thank you very very much
[17:32:40] <BillCriswell> aaas: http://jsbin.com/ehomof/1/edit if I wanted to collect that.
[17:33:20] <aaas> BillCriswell wow thank you so much
[17:33:21] <zim> b-lew: what are you trying to do? and play here http://jsfiddle.net/L7ymr/ I have edited the .click to .on for starters
[17:35:05] <zim> b-lew: sorry and did it wrong :-) update http://jsfiddle.net/L7ymr/1/
[17:35:05] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: I've got a heading that wraps an image. When I use $(':header') as a selector, it adds the ligature to both the heading text as well as the image path inside the heading.
[17:35:48] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Ah, I remember this.. The only way around it I could think of it putting the actual text of the header in a span.
[17:37:20] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: yea, i can't really change the markup easily since it's generated by a CMS. I hoped it'd be easier to just effect the header and not the child elements
[17:37:57] <b-lew> zim: huh, I'll try that and go from there. I'm not the best with this stuff but giving it a shot
[17:38:32] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Hmmm... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5291703/jquery-select-and-wrap-textnode might help a lot
[17:39:21] <oliwe> what is this magic
[17:39:22] <zim> b-lew: I have not change any functionality just used .on rather than .click
[17:39:38] <zim> b-lew: what do you want to do?
[17:39:45] <oliwe> sometimes out of what i beleive is random hatred from windows my text starts writing over itself
[17:39:50] <oliwe> my friend told me to click "insert"
[17:39:57] <oliwe> wat
[17:40:14] <oliwe> sitting at a computer for 20+ years
[17:40:15] <oliwe> never knew
[17:40:50] <zim> oliwe: LMFAO

[17:41:21] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: http://jsbin.com/uqonod/1/edit mwhahahahahaah
[17:41:46] <BryanRuiz> lol
[17:43:04] <b-lew> I see, I'd like to add a + and - to the toggle.
[17:43:10] <b-lew> is that possible, zin?
[17:48:11] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: i just tried to add .contents() thinking it just acts on the text, correct?
[17:48:48] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Nope. You would do this http://jsbin.com/uqonod/1/edit then run the plugin like $(':header span').pluginTime()
[17:51:22] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Just updated it, notice how the <span> isn't in the HTML, it's added via JS then targeted withJS later. http://jsbin.com/uqonod/1/edit
[17:51:45] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: thanks, but doesn't seem to be working with the script I'm using
[17:51:45] <BillCriswell> That first line wraps all plain text nodes in a <span>.
[17:52:50] <BillCriswell> vinmassaro: Does the plugin only work on block level elements or something?
[17:56:38] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: not sure. I'm trying a different script this time
[17:56:46] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell: have to run. Thanks for your help!
[17:56:50] <tds5016> hi all. I just wanted to ask this before trying to write it from scratch, because I dislike recreating the wheel.... Is there a nice/easy way to make an image bigger then smaller?
[17:56:50] <vinmassaro> BillCriswell++
[17:57:00] <tds5016> like a "popping" effect, if that make sense?
[17:57:01] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[17:57:18] <tds5016> for some reason sizing it bigger/smaller makes the image resize from the left.
[17:57:25] <tds5016> is there a way to make it resize from the center?
[17:57:29] <BillCriswell> I read "pooping" effect. Almost bed time.
[17:57:48] <tds5016> haha BillCriswell I support that.
[17:58:33] <tds5016> does the question/animation I'm looking for make sense?
[18:00:15] <tds5016> like I want a "shaking zoom"
[18:00:34] <BillCriswell> tds5016: You using jQuery UI? If so this appears to be what you want... http://jsfiddle.net/wNXLY/
[18:01:15] <tds5016> BillCriswell: except I want it to go smaller, then bigger.
[18:01:48] <tds5016> for some reason, it seems that the image is also "growing" from the left.
[18:01:50] <tds5016> not from the middle
[18:02:26] <tds5016> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/kJYJD/
[18:02:29] <tds5016> that's what happens.
[18:03:30] <tds5016> is there a better way to center the div?
[18:03:54] <BillCriswell> tds5016: Ehh.. I'd have to spend more time messing with this than I have right now.
[18:07:04] <zim> night night all
[18:14:00] <barryhjames> The following code is not adding the class to the text area. $('form textarea').addClass('error').val(data.message.err);
[18:14:07] <barryhjames> Am I missing something here?
[18:14:35] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: That should work.
[18:15:55] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Probably something silly. Any errors?
[18:16:27] <barryhjames> Ah, looks like it is something in my PHP Ajax call. Strange. Thanks!
[18:16:40] <BillCriswell> welcome.
[18:16:43] <BillCriswell> Night all!
[18:16:55] <coldhead> goodnight bill frisell
[18:17:06] <coldhead> i will never forget the time we spent together at the village vanguard
[18:18:00] <popof_> dont
[18:18:04] <popof_> cheat on me bro
[18:21:17] <trewd`> how can I append a child element to this span: $('#filesUploaded').append($('<span>').attr({ id: $newName.replace('.', '') })
[18:26:40] <thujone> $('<span></span>').appendTo('#filesUploaded').attr({ id: $newName.replace('.', '') }).append()
[18:27:02] <thujone> trewd`
[18:28:47] <coldhead> trewd`: http://jsfiddle.net/ea3DM/
[18:29:25] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/DLFJCAwQ else part does not work
[18:29:26] <StephenS> why>
[18:30:01] <tds5016> that's where the problem is... apparently when you use scale... it converts your divs that have a % width to pixels.
[18:30:12] <StephenS> ?
[18:31:36] <StephenS> tds5016, what?
[18:31:49] <thujone> StephenS: you're missing an argument in the .attr()
[18:32:12] <thujone> .attr('src', '...')
[18:32:57] <tds5016> what is happening is that jquery is setting the width to pixels when you use animate or effect()
[18:33:05] <tds5016> instead of keeping them as % values.
[18:33:08] <StephenS> sigh
[18:33:32] <StephenS> .attr('src','images/thumbnail/unknown.png')
[18:33:36] <StephenS> still no luck :(
[18:33:38] <StephenS> thujone, ?
[18:34:31] <trewd`> coldhead: here's where it gets tricky, how do I append an img and a <a> element to the span
[18:34:45] <tds5016> any idea how to get height in animate to be relative to width?
[18:35:03] <tds5016> slideImage.animate({                                                                                   height: "auto",                                                                                    width: "100%"                                                                                  });
[18:35:08] <tds5016> that appears not to work./
[18:35:15] <tds5016> sorry for the spam. I thoguht that was one line :-X
[18:35:24] <StephenS> thujone, I dont get it :(
[18:35:27] <StephenS> .attr('src','images/thumbnail/unknown.png')
[18:35:29] <coldhead> trewd`: http://jsfiddle.net/ea3DM/1/ ?
[18:35:30] <StephenS> and still no work
[18:36:27] <StephenS> what am I missing here http://pastebin.com/ZexnvbWE
[18:36:30] <StephenS> please any help
[18:36:34] <thujone> look at what the error says
[18:36:41] <thujone> what is the javascript error?
[18:37:19] <StephenS> console says no error
[18:37:50] <bambanx> guys how i can connect this example with yahoo api for get the time from diferents places ? http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/css3-digital-clock-with-jquery/
[18:38:18] <StephenS> thujone, console says no error
[18:38:43] <thujone> can you post the html
[18:38:54] <StephenS> sure
[18:39:04] <thujone> is there a request being made for the graphic?
[18:39:06] <StephenS> <img id="blah" src="#" alt="your image" />
[18:39:13] <StephenS> no
[18:39:13] <thujone> or is it just skipping the entire else section?
[18:39:17] <StephenS> just html request for src
[18:39:28] <StephenS> but src should have graphic element
[18:39:34] <StephenS> included if input.files is empty
[18:39:39] <StephenS> thats why I added else condition
[18:41:05] <thujone> oh, well your if test is probably wrong then
[18:41:44] <StephenS> well I do if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
[18:41:45] <thujone> if the if-block is always running, then you don't have a good test
[18:41:59] <StephenS> so if there is input.files and data is in array
[18:42:02] <StephenS> what is wrong with that
[18:42:03] <StephenS> gmm
[18:42:05] <StephenS> hmm
[18:42:20] <thujone> i would try a console.log(input.files, input.files[0])
[18:42:40] <Hilton> I've got an internal web app for our company which I am able to restrict to a single browser. I've restricted it to Firefox so I can make use of the jsPrintSetup plugin, giving me better control of printing for things like invoices etc where I don't want browser headers. The problem is this only seems to work if they use the provided print button; if they press Ctrl-P or File > Print, all my...
[18:42:41] <thujone> maybe you're getting empty strings for those conditions
[18:42:41] <Hilton> ...settings are lost. I understand Firefox 19 will finally respect @page css, so maybe things will be better then, but for now - is there any way to prevent the user from printing manually? I promise to use this information only for good.
[18:44:05] <StephenS> hmm something is really wrong
[18:44:43] <StephenS> I just tried http://pastebin.com/PxZ5ivMV thujone and still no img preview
[18:44:45] <StephenS> how that come?
[18:44:51] <StephenS> There is no condition at all
[18:44:59] <StephenS> and html sis still <img id="blah" src="#" alt="your image" />
[18:45:05] <coldhead> how that come indeed
[18:45:17] <StephenS> ?
[18:46:09] <thujone> how are you calling that function
[18:46:38] <StephenS> readURL
[18:46:44] <StephenS> but that eradUrl is called only
[18:46:56] <StephenS> <input type="file" onchange="readURL(this);"/>
[18:47:18] <StephenS> so if it was never called it wont display
[18:47:26] <StephenS> but I was wondering how can I make it always to call
[18:47:44] <StephenS> if I change file edit name I get attr but on default it wont work
[18:48:37] <thujone> if you can get it all into a working jsfiddle, i can help
[18:49:18] <thujone> not working, but just get the html and js on there
[18:49:24] <thujone> and i can help figure it out
[18:49:35] <tds5016> anyone use touchpunch?
[18:49:53] <tds5016> I need help figuring out how I'd stop the helper from showing up in the top right hand corner of the div it gets appended to.
[18:54:28] <StephenS> thujone, http://jsfiddle.net/rQrke/
[18:54:44] <thujone> ok
[19:01:44] <thujone> i don't have much experience with FileReader, but the 'input' value that's being passed in is just an element
[19:04:03] <thujone> i think you want to access the File at event.target.files[0]
[19:05:47] <StephenS> hmm
[19:11:32] <thujone> StephenS, sorry, i was wrong about that, but it's actually running ok in the fiddle now. i copied the js into the html pane
[19:11:39] <thujone> http://jsfiddle.net/rQrke/
[19:11:45] <munichlinux> is there anyway we can say function declaration or function expressions one better over the other?
[19:11:53] <thujone> i'm not sure what's not working about this now
[19:12:46] <StephenS> hmm I got another problem with modals
[19:12:56] <StephenS> why does my modals show on even if they are not even loaded?
[19:19:08] <StephenS> ah nvm works now
[19:19:39] <thujone> that's good
[19:20:32] <thujone> you can put <div style="display: none"> on the modal div if you want to make sure it doesn't get shown while the page is loading
[19:22:30] <StephenS> I fixed it somehow
[19:22:40] <StephenS> I always hate that part when I fix it and I have no idea how I made it :(
[19:23:56] <thujone> yeah that sucks
[19:40:58] <tds5016> is there a way to send a click event to a sepcific location?
[19:41:07] <Hilton> jQueryUI Tooltip() doesn't appear on disabled buttons. Is there a way to fix this?
[19:41:10] <tds5016> to "force a click to coords 0, 0"
[19:41:12] <ryanneufeld> tds5016: in what way?
[19:41:13] <tds5016> or something like that?
[19:43:04] <tds5016> I have a hunch why touch punch is screwing up how it is.
[19:54:02] <Kent373> hi there i would like some small code
[19:54:23] <Kent373> anybody willing to gimme 5 minutes

[19:56:20] <StephenS> I mean it works but on default its still picture with no src location..
[19:56:33] <thisboy> Anybody else find jsFiddle's auto-indenting slightly annoying? Do you have to spend a lot of time undoing indents that jsFiddle assumes you need?
[19:56:47] <thujone> you mean on page load?
[19:56:49] <dismist> they are teaching u proper coding structure
[19:56:54] <thujone> what do you mean by "default"?
[19:56:55] <Kent373> i am using seperate code for each input to update a relative SPAN with the title attribute same to the ID attribute of the INPUT
[19:57:02] <StephenS> thujone, yes
[19:57:07] <StephenS> since there is nothing in src
[19:57:10] <StephenS> how to fix that
[19:57:26] <StephenS> I want to not show pic at all
[19:57:30] <thujone> you can add a src to the img tag
[19:57:32] <thujone> oh
[19:57:42] <StephenS> or thats evenbeyyer
[19:57:48] <tds5016> hi. can someone tell me how I'd remove a hoverclass?
[19:57:48] <StephenS> better, I can pull up from db pic
[19:57:49] <thujone> set "display: none" on the img
[19:57:55] <thisboy> dismist: Was that meant for me?
[19:58:04] <thujone> at the end of your code block, $('<img>').show()
[19:58:15] <StephenS> thujone, I did add src to the img tag
[19:58:17] <thujone> or whatever the ID is
[19:58:44] <thujone> <img src="..." style="display: none" />
[19:58:57] <thujone> at the end of your js, do
[19:59:06] <StephenS> wait so to add $('<img>').show() ?
[19:59:07] <thisboy> Anybody else find jsFiddle's auto-indenting slightly annoying? Do you have to spend a lot of time undoing indents that jsFiddle assumes you need?
[19:59:07] <thujone> $('#image-id').show()
[19:59:10] <thisboy> If so - would you mind contacting the author asking him to speed up the "optional indenting" feature so I'm not the only one asking him?
[19:59:16] <thisboy> Many thanks!
[19:59:32] <tds5016> looks like hoverclass is apparently causing issues :-/. I have no idea how to remove it.
[20:00:55] <StephenS> uhm thujone if I add style="display: none" to the pic, when I select a pic I never get preview..
[20:01:54] <StephenS> thujone, what to do?
[20:02:35] <thujone> after you set the img src attribute, you use .show() to show the image
[20:02:50] <thujone> <img id="my-image" src="..." />
[20:02:58] <thujone> $('#my-image').show()
[20:03:40] <thujone> show() removes the "display: none" styling
[20:03:42] <thujone> that's what it does
[20:04:50] <StephenS> to put that on end of my function?
[20:05:09] <thujone> yes
[20:05:38] <thujone> do you understand?
[20:05:47] <StephenS> works :))
[20:05:53] <thujone> phew
[20:29:50] <chovy> nothing happens when i publish my jquery plugin
[20:30:08] <chovy> and click 'test' for the web hook doesn't seem to do anything either.
[20:36:25] <coldhead> hej b1lly
[20:36:38] <coldhead> chovy: you mean for plugins.jquery.com?
[20:36:39] <b1lly> hola coldhead
[20:36:41] <b1lly> whats up
[20:37:32] <coldhead> i am about to break a coworkers arms for using @ instead of &#64; in a template, and breaking all our JS
[20:38:11] <b1lly> your templates get included with js?
[20:38:21] <coldhead> they are clientside templates
[20:38:31] <b1lly> what framework are you working with
[20:38:31] <coldhead> jquery's now deprecated tmpl()
[20:38:35] <coldhead> i don't want to talk about it
[20:38:40] <b1lly> I never used the jquery templates
[20:38:48] <coldhead> there are some good ones
[20:38:52] <coldhead> jquery tmpl is not a good one
[20:38:57] <coldhead> BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
[20:39:19] <b1lly> ha
[20:39:24] <b1lly> do you know a good window manager for ubuntu
[20:39:51] <coldhead> that really is the great question isn't it
[20:40:01] <coldhead> i am still testing unity
[20:40:03] <coldhead> and i hate it
[20:40:14] <b1lly> unity is the gui?
[20:40:21] <coldhead> if you have a better alternative i am all ears
[20:40:29] <coldhead> unity is the one they ship with, i think
[20:40:38] <b1lly> yeah, that's the gui
[20:40:47] <coldhead> but not the wm?
[20:40:49] <b1lly> I guess the term windows manager is to broad
[20:41:00] <coldhead> i mostly just use emacs so it's not a big deal
[20:41:04] <b1lly> I want something to help control my windows/apps
[20:41:07] <coldhead> but this unity thing is pretty annoying
[20:41:09] <b1lly> like being able to snap things
[20:41:15] <coldhead> xmonad?
[20:41:31] <b1lly> yeah exactly liike that
[20:41:37] <b1lly> one of my buddies at work told me about this
[20:41:39] <b1lly> and i forgot about it
[20:41:48] <b1lly> is that not a "window mnager" ?
[20:42:11] <coldhead> yes it is
[20:42:29] <coldhead> i am not interested enough in GUIs vs WMs to properly understand the distinction
[20:42:42] <coldhead> i just want it to work and leave me alone
[20:42:50] <coldhead> people sure like xmonad
[20:43:15] <b1lly> yeah I get confused too
[20:46:16] <b1lly> coldhead: are you a front-end dev?
[20:48:32] <aaas> Im adding myValue + 0.1 and I get 0.20.1 instead of the expected 0.3.. myValue comes from $(this).attr('data-...')   how do I add these two?
[20:48:57] <aaas> that is the 0.2 was grabbed from the data attribute
[20:50:03] <aaas> found parseFloat but it gives me 0.30000000004
[20:51:10] <coldhead> mostly front-end, yes b1lly
[20:52:29] <b1lly> aaas: it looks like your concatenating, not adding?
[20:53:02] <systemfault> aaas: parseFloat is the way to go.
[20:53:03] <aaas> b1lly yes, so I run parseFloat on the string so i can add...not sure if thats the right way...not sure if you can cast as a float or something
[20:53:20] <b1lly> yeah, as systemfault sai
[20:53:21] <systemfault> aaas: As for result…. welcome to the wonderful world of floats.
[20:53:33] <aaas> systemfault thanks... i found toFixed() to take care of the precision... i know i hate it ;)
[20:53:44] <systemfault> aaas: Wonderful :)
[21:30:41] <__machine> i have an event to open external links... $(window).on('click', 'a.popup, a[href^=http]', handler); ... what can i put in handler() or part of the on() selector to NOT execute if the event target has a .no-popup class? if ($(event.target).is(':not(.no-popup)')) { ... } ... is there a better way?
[21:31:31] <Cork> if($(this).hasClass('no-popup')) {}
[21:31:48] <Cork> you don't need to use event.target this will be the same element
[21:32:48] <__machine> so just check if the target has a class or not inside my handler is the best way?
[21:32:49] <awc737> hey all, I have company busting my balls about my code, because I didn't use JavascriptMVC, and telling my boss they won't accept my code
[21:32:58] <awc737> would you look at this and tell me if it's unbearable?
[21:33:06] <awc737> http://pastie.org/5828425
[21:33:19] <Cork> __machine: that was ment to go inside the handler...
[21:33:47] <Cork> if you mean put it in the selector string; sure thats possible
[21:33:56] <awc737> it is a bit long, I could refactor a bit and reorder the functions to look better, but this is essentially it: http://paste.laravel.com/fzI
[21:34:04] <Cork> __machine: 'a.popup, a[href^=http]:not(.no-popup)'
[21:34:12] <Cork> __machine: its not better though
[21:35:02] <__machine> Cork: is inside the handler more efficient? the docs say .not() is usually better than :not(), but i dont think i could use .not() with a selector passed to on()
[21:35:18] <awc737> any opinions on this code? http://pastie.org/5828425
[21:35:36] <Cork> __machine: well you will get more code, but normally ya, it is
[21:35:48] <Cork> __machine: and no the selector can only be a string, not a function call
[21:36:12] <Cork> (as its meant to be called in future, and not just on elements that are there right now
[21:36:14] <Cork> )
[21:37:24] <__machine> thanks
[21:38:01] <Cork> awc737: some groups want to do strict mvc, thats just how it is
[21:38:11] <Cork> awc737: though that said; you REALLY need to remove live
[21:38:28] <Cork> jquery 1.9 doesn't support .live anymore and its been depricated for 4 versions
[21:38:37] <awc737> Cork, I thought live was required for dynamic elements
[21:38:39] <awc737> hmm
[21:38:45] <Cork> no you use delegate or on
[21:38:49] <awc737> oh
[21:38:54] <Cork> (on with delegate syntax)
[21:39:09] <Cork> its explained on the live page
[21:39:13] <Cork> ?.live
[21:39:25] <Cork> aaand the bot is dead again...
[21:39:35] <Cork> awc737: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[21:39:44] <awc737> thanks Cork
[21:39:51] <b1lly> awc737: live is the old delegate and on, I believe
[21:40:06] <awc737> Cork, I don't want you to sift through it, but is there anything off the top of your head, or that caught your eye, that could be breaking IE?
[21:40:19] <Cork> b1lly: no live is a predecessor to delegate, with a broken model
[21:40:54] <b1lly> awc737: what's the error your getting
[21:41:00] <Cork> awc737: well mvc is strict about separating data and code
[21:41:08] <awc737> I don't even have IE :-/ I can't get it working in Wine
[21:41:13] <Cork> so ex. live 438 - 445 is nogo
[21:41:26] <Cork> 414 is another one
[21:41:37] <awc737> so I don't know the error yet, but the Google map just doesn't load, click events don't happen
[21:41:43] <Cork> that should be part of the html not the js
[21:42:03] <awc737> something in the JS is breaking
[21:42:03] <b1lly> awc737: i'd just set breakpoints in the code
[21:42:06] <awc737> k
[21:42:10] <Cork> awc737: you can't use ie in wine, it won't be a valid test bed
[21:42:12] <b1lly> and start trying to narrow it down
[21:42:13] <awc737> I just need to get fricken IE installed somehow
[21:42:15] <awc737> oh...
[21:42:17] <Cork> you need to use a different computer or a vm
[21:42:30] <awc737> yeah I'm working on downloading Microsoft's VM
[21:44:13] <awc737> lol Cork 438-445 is a nono... that's not related to live is it?
[21:44:24] <awc737> but also, whats the proper way of achieving things like that
[21:44:41] <Cork> <awc737> hey all, I have company busting my balls about my code, because I didn't use JavascriptMVC, and telling my boss they won't accept my code <--
[21:45:07] <awc737> oh
[21:45:26] <awc737> Cork, I guess you don't like 366 - 485
[21:46:02] <Cork> awc737: i would prefer to have that in its correct place, but "don't like" is too harsh
[21:46:17] <awc737> Cork, I'm really unfamiliar how to achieve something like that though, otherwise
[21:46:27] <Cork> but honnestly html should be kept in the html file not the js file
[21:46:59] <awc737> hmm, I'm not sure where to start though? create one of those elements empty, and clone it?
[21:47:17] <Cork> well you could use a template plugin for example
[21:47:33] <Cork> and for some of them you could just have the html in the page with display: none
[21:47:38] <Cork> and show it when its needed
[21:47:56] <awc737> what about when I'm retrieving a number of results and looping each one to display it
[21:48:02] <awc737> clone the block of HTML?
[21:48:20] <Cork> template
[21:48:22] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/aefxx/jQote2
[21:48:31] <awc737> I would still need to inject each value (store.name, store.type), into the appropriate element, and it would get about just as large
[21:48:54] <Cork> this explains it more http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[21:49:06] <Cork> yes, and no
[21:49:18] <Cork> it would be separated into chunks where you expect them
[21:49:19] <awc737> ok thanks Cork , but is there any solution which is just HTML? No plugins or template engine
[21:49:24] <Cork> and that makes it easier to follow
[21:49:27] <awc737> yeah
[21:49:31] <Cork> and makes it more modular
[21:49:53] <Cork> well you could add a template with display:none
[21:50:14] <Cork> and have an element for each place you want to insert values
[21:50:27] <awc737> a blank one, then clone it, then do for instance $('element .h5').append(store.name)
[21:50:33] <Cork> then just clone the container; do a search in the clone and set the .html() on the element
[21:50:39] <awc737> ok, good call
[21:50:45] <awc737> if I'm not going to template
[21:50:48] <awc737> I'll do that
[21:51:10] <Cork> var clone = $('#template').clone(); clone.find('.value1').html(value)
[21:51:21] <Cork> target.append(clone)
[21:52:21] <awc737> k, thanks Cork
[21:59:11] <__machine> in $.fn.somePlugin = function() {} ... if i execute $(window).somePlugin() ... would `this` be window or $(window) ?
[22:41:23] <BryanRuiz> how do i detect the #yakkay-covers in the url http://local.adelineadeline.com/accessories/helmets.html#yakkay-covers
[22:42:37] <coldhead> if ( window.location.hash.match(/#yakkay-covers/) )

[22:55:45] * coldhead kicks b-ot 
[22:56:05] <Cork> no love huh?
[22:56:46] <coldhead> worst bot ever
[22:56:54] <coldhead> node.js clearly isn't ready for IRC enterprise
[22:57:12] <Cork> well bot-t isn't much better >_>
[22:58:58] <coldhead> bot-t is like r2-d2, unreliable but immortal
[22:59:01] <coldhead> always in our hearts
[22:59:05] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:59:10] <Cork> heh

[23:26:13] <Qbix1> hi
[23:26:15] <Qbix1> want to see something cool
[23:26:17] <Cork> so parseFloat(input1.val() + parseFloat(input2.val()
[23:26:27] <Cork> * parseFloat(input1.val()) + parseFloat(input2.val()
[23:26:27] <Qbix1> https://gist.github.com/4602842
[23:26:33] <Qbix1> thoughts?
[23:41:56] <kuter> how can i put result like <span id="sum" /> into textbox ?

[23:43:30] <kuter> Cork: thanks for quick answer i'll check this
[23:43:45] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I'm experiencing something weird... I have an ajax call, and yesterday it worked perfectly. And today, when the the file is requested, it just writes 'cancelled' in the network monitor...? And the files hasn't changed (have looked at the last change date/time of the files). Any ideas on what can cause this?
[23:44:02] <jaffipaffi> Using this code: http://pastebin.com/WtUTStqW
[23:44:06] <Qbix1> don't you thin it's kewl
[23:44:08] <Qbix1> eh?
[23:44:34] <anonymus> @jason_day :  r u here?
[23:44:41] <Cork> jaffipaffi: have you checked so the page isn't reloading?
[23:44:53] <Qbix1> a jason a day keeps the crockford away. lol
[23:45:39] <jaffipaffi> Cork: Yup - page isn't reloading
[23:46:33] <jaffipaffi> Cork: Just looks like this in the network monitor: http://i.imgur.com/M8ilBTl.png
[23:46:44] <anonymus> @cork: can you have a look at this page and tell me wts wrong in my code? http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/9dQqU/
[23:47:06] <Cork> jaffipaffi: and if you copy the ajax call into its own html file that does nothing except that call though $.ajax; does it work?
[23:48:05] <kuter> i have something like this       $('.sumka').val($("#sum").html(sum.toFixed(2)));
[23:48:28] <kuter>                   '<td><input class="sumka" /></td></tr>';
[23:48:51] <kuter> and i've got [objectObject]
[23:49:26] <jaffipaffi> Cork: Hmm, yeah it does.....
[23:49:38] <jaffipaffi> But it worked yesterday, and code didn't change???
[23:50:09] <jaffipaffi> What can it be?
[23:51:46] <jaffipaffi> It's like all ajax calls on that page doesn't work
[23:51:47] <Cork> anonymus: http://jsfiddle.net/9dQqU/4/
[23:51:49] <jaffipaffi> But they worked yesterday
[23:51:53] <jaffipaffi> And I haven't changed a thing :S
[23:51:59] <Cork> anonymus: when you create a fiddle please make sure it has all the resources
[23:53:21] <Cork> jaffipaffi: something is canceling the call
[23:53:32] <Cork> == client side
[23:54:00] <Cork> anonymus: and if you want animations you need the esing library http://jsfiddle.net/9dQqU/5/
[23:54:04] <Cork> *easing
[23:54:05] <anonymus> @cork: ohk. am new to jsfiddle. and  i dint get the actual result.I mean images  dont hv slideshow effect.
[23:54:24] <Cork> you need additional libraries for that
[23:54:29] <Cork> like the doc says
[23:54:36] <Cork> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[23:55:11] <anonymus> once check this http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/9dQqU/
[23:55:21] <anonymus> oh
[23:55:26] <Cork> still broken
[23:55:49] <Qbix1> is it true that in JS I can use a function with new and without new?
[23:55:58] <Cork> yes
[23:55:59] <Qbix1> So, I can have different semantics for a = new Foo() and a = Foo() ?
[23:56:10] <Qbix1> are there any tricks or standard conventions for this?
[23:56:11] <Cork> if you use new you use it as a constructor
[23:56:16] <Cork> without it its just a function call
[23:56:23] <jaffipaffi> Cork: Hmmm... What can cancel it?
[23:56:27] <Qbix1> right, so I can overload it with other meanings?
[23:56:29] <jeremy-> I'm relatively new to jquery and javascript in general. I've started with the basics and I'm finding jquery really nice to use and intuitive. I have a problem that my javascript files are looking like a huge mess with like 50 click handlers, almost seeming like I'm repeating code. Has anybody got any good references on trying to be a bit smarter with combining click handlers into better functions,
[23:56:29] <jeremy-> (that reuse code), etc.
[23:56:36] <Cork> jaffipaffi: can't say without debugging the page
[23:56:46] <Cork> Qbix1: not really
[23:57:03] <jaffipaffi> It doesn't work in either Chrome or Firefox
[23:57:07] <Cork> Qbix1: many librarys use a wrapper so you don't need to use new
[23:57:11] <Cork> it calls new internally
[23:57:18] <Cork> $() is an example of that
[23:57:28] <Qbix1> why would I use new ?
[23:57:35] <Qbix1> I think people forget to use new way too often
[23:57:37] <Cork> uh... to create an object
[23:57:43] <Qbix1> maybe better to avoid it, and just have wrapper Foo()
[23:57:49] <Cork> Qbix1: you can't "forget"
[23:58:08] <Cork> if you call a constructor without new you're just calling a function
[23:58:14] <Cork> and what it returns is what you will get
[23:58:50] <Cork> but if you call it with new you get an object that is initialized in the function
[23:58:56] <Cork> (it doesn't have to return it)
[23:59:00] <anonymus> @coek: do i need to download easing plugin ?
[23:59:15] <anonymus> *@cork
[23:59:28] <Cork> anonymus: most likely, but can't really tell as you've only given broken fiddles
