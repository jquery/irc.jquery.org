[00:01:10] <Lann> *happy new contract dance*
[00:01:23] <Lann> getting freelance contracts is a pain
[00:04:06] <grafi> o√¥
[00:10:56] <Lann> cork: i am saddened by how correct you were
[00:11:19] <Cork> Lann: well i've banged my head on mobiles my self so...
[00:11:31] <Lann> i'm pretty irritated by it
[00:11:37] <Lann> time to play some bf3
[00:11:39] <Cork> espacially iphone and the built in browser in android
[00:12:08] <Lann> at least it's not drupal so far of all things i've ever done drupal has irritated me the most
[00:12:22] <Lann> i'm not even saying it sucks. it just is a pain to learn the quirks
[00:12:43] <Cork> well it does sucks
[00:12:53] <Lann> heh, i dunno
[00:12:58] <Lann> i find myself reccomending it
[00:13:02] <Cork> for quite a while supporting the web standard has not been a priority on mobile
[00:13:26] <Cork> they have been more interested in supporting flashy things like animate, transitions, tansitions3d and so on
[00:13:28] <Lann> but i think CMS vs scratch is a lesser of two evils decision anyways
[00:13:55] <Lann> oh, hmm
[00:14:01] <Cork> luckely firefox and chrome does a good job on mobile though
[00:14:09] <Cork> sadly they can't get onto ios...
[00:14:21] <Lann> yeah and the client is asking for ios specifically
[00:14:27] <Lann> and maybe android if it's not a pain heh
[00:14:49] <Lann> this next site i just got the contract for has no mobile requirements at all, yay
[00:14:49] <Cork> Lann: unless you demand them to install chrome or firefox on the phone
[00:14:50] <Cork> it is
[00:14:54] <Cork> the stock browser sucks
[00:15:17] <Lann> oh, i've played with it. it had quirks
[00:15:36] <Lann> i have a very gray hat shopping cart aggregation library writtten in jquery
[00:15:44] <Lann> i had to get it to work on android, was a pain
[00:15:48] <Cork> it has more or less all the bugs iphone does
[00:15:54] <Cork> not all of them though
[00:16:08] <Lann> basically it can add products to your cart on sites like bestbuy/etc who actively attempt to prevent it
[00:16:12] <Lann> is that illegal, i dont know
[00:16:33] <Lann> is circumventing csrf illegal?
[00:16:46] <Cork> depends on the country
[00:16:50] <Lann> i mean, i'm not doing anything BAD
[00:16:51] <Cork> it isn't here
[00:16:56] <Cork> but i bet it is in the us
[00:17:01] <Lann> the client WANTS to do this, its just that bestbuy is using things like csrf to prevent it
[00:17:05] <Lann> but they dont properly hash their tokens
[00:17:10] <Lann> so i can acquire tokens for later use
[00:17:16] <Lann> dumbasses
[00:17:20] <grafi> yay security
[00:17:40] <Lann> heh other sites are worse
[00:17:46] <Lann> some have csrf tokens and never even check them
[00:17:52] <Lann> i can just omit it
[00:17:58] <Lann> i'm like...how
[00:18:05] <grafi> ^^
[00:18:06] <Cork> they most likely use a framework that creates it by default
[00:18:09] <Lann> then i realize from looking at their code it was very obviously cheaply outsourced developers
[00:18:09] <Cork> and just doesn't check them
[00:18:31] <Lann> i'm not so sure that csrf libraries all hash against something unique about you
[00:18:34] <grafi> thats still bad though, dont you think?
[00:18:37] <Lann> therefore if you just HAVE TOKENS that's fine
[00:18:48] <Lann> i can scrape 10k tokens from your site at once in that case
[00:19:33] <Lann> but i doubt anyone cares
[00:19:41] <Lann> the site i was building effectively just brings them customers
[00:19:51] <Lann> so i think it's gray rather than black hat
[00:19:59] <Cork> Lann: the csrf is to protect the site and the customer
[00:20:33] <Cork> and if nothing else you're most likely break the user agreement with the site if you circumvent it
[00:20:39] <Lann> well i'll say "add this item id to my cart" using more or less csrf, if they request at token i just scrape one in a background thread
[00:21:11] <Cork> Lann: yes, it's add to the cart from there site
[00:21:17] <Cork> not from a third party site :)
[00:21:26] <Cork> that is the point of csrf
[00:21:36] <Lann> some sites think they can stop you by preventing all remote requests using ‚Ä¶waht's that setting that prevents iframes
[00:21:51] <Lann> there's a bug in JS that circumvents it though, open in all browsers including mobile
[00:22:18] <Cork> Lann: i'm not sure why you think exploiting sites is a good thing...
[00:22:23] <opc0de> Hi, I want to create in javascript, an integrated window to my web page, where the user can enter commands similar to those of a terminal. The window must be resized by user. Anyone knows a javascript lib that could help me to create this?
[00:22:32] <ph88> o/ Cork
[00:22:45] <Cork> Lann: and if you find a bug in the browsers report it so it can be fixed
[00:22:45] <Lann> it's not a good thing but a particular client wanted it as a temporary measure while they were still a garage startup
[00:22:59] <Lann> i think it's reported but i dont want to call more attention to it at the moment heh
[00:23:08] <Lann> i've had chats about it and people said it was reported
[00:23:49] <Lann> but more or less it involves settimeout and forwarding the browser while the security checks are checking your domain before the forwarding takes place and the forwarding then executes after the timeout
[00:23:55] <Cork> opc0de: the dialog could be jquery ui dialog
[00:24:20] <Lann> it's quite a scary bug imo
[00:24:21] <Cork> opc0de: for the actuall command interpreter, you might have to dig a bit
[00:24:46] <Cork> well not really
[00:24:50] <Lann> and interestingly it works in EVERY BROWSER
[00:25:09] <Cork> Lann: as long as the site wrapping it can't access the content in the iframe it is a minor bug
[00:25:18] <Lann> it cant i dont think
[00:25:20] <opc0de> ok, thanks
[00:25:22] <Lann> it just circumvents iframe restrictions
[00:25:26] <Lann> so it's minor
[00:25:45] <Lann> but i can forward you to an ebay link that adds an item to your cart then forward you back to my site
[00:25:47] <Cork> it is kinda interesting that they don't set it each time they make a connection though
[00:26:25] <Lann> or i can forward you to 5 ebay links consecutively that way
[00:26:31] <Lann> so it possibly could be used for evil
[00:27:47] * Lann thinks of ways to use such a tactic as a botnet
[00:28:24] <Lann> i wonder if anybody does things like intentionally reposts viral videos to get traffic to a site and then uses javascript to make a botnet out of htem discreetly
[00:28:29] <Taggnostr> how can I select all elements followed by a specific element?
[00:28:41] <Taggnostr> e.g. all <p> followed by an <ul>
[00:29:18] <Lann> if they are then it's working on me
[00:29:45] <Taggnostr> maybe $('p+ul').prev()?
[00:30:10] <Cork> Taggnostr: you can't search for elements followed by something
[00:30:32] <Cork> you have to select the element and then look back at the other element
[00:30:46] <Cork> ex. $('ul').prev('p')
[00:31:15] <xec_> Taggnostr: i like your version, doesn't it work?
[00:31:18] <Lann> omg i think i just thought up a botnet that isnt even illegal lol
[00:31:20] <Taggnostr> I'm trying
[00:32:29] <Cork> Taggnostr: but both of those will have the same problem, there my not be anything between cause then it doesn't work
[00:33:04] <xec_> Lann: why would it not be illegal
[00:33:28] <Lann> because it depends on what you use it for but you arent committing any crime to execute javascript on a visitor of your sites browser
[00:33:45] <Lann> i mean it's not inherently illegal
[00:33:54] <Lann> not like a typical one that requires an installation
[00:34:02] <Lann> you'd just be floating it on viral traffic
[00:34:06] <Cork> Lann: well no, but if you cause the client to do something to a third party service it is illegal
[00:34:09] <xec_> if you're exploiting a bug to make someone's computer do something they did not intend, how is that not illegal
[00:34:19] <Lann> even if it's seti?
[00:34:38] <Cork> Lann: yes, even if its set timeout
[00:34:42] <Lann> doing something it did not intend cannot be defined and therefore is not related to a law
[00:34:57] <Taggnostr> xec_, Cork, it doesn't seem to work
[00:35:07] <Lann> you click a cat picture, it uses js to contribute to say SETI
[00:35:08] <xec_> ?demo @ Taggnostr
[00:35:09] <bot-t> Taggnostr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:35:14] <Lann> i dont see how that breaks any law
[00:35:24] <Cork> Lann: if you cause a user to do something not intended (by the user) to a third party; you are doing something illegal
[00:35:37] <Lann> i think that just isnt true honestly
[00:35:50] <Lann> because if you take your typical page
[00:35:53] <xec_> Lann: neither of us are lawyers, but it makes sense
[00:35:55] <Cork> Lann: just to make an example
[00:35:57] <Lann> it's doing thousands of things, the user never asked to do
[00:36:07] <Lann> if they did, they'd be the programmer
[00:36:14] <Cork> a developer found a way to make <form> tags connect and spam irc servers in firefox
[00:36:21] <Lann> for example, they asked to see a cat picture, not the ads
[00:36:22] <Cork> just by having the user visit a site
[00:36:27] <Lann> by your logic the ads are illegal
[00:36:30] <Lann> since they contact a third party service
[00:36:30] <Taggnostr> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/K69WA/
[00:36:35] <Cork> that WAS illegal and the site got shut down
[00:36:46] <Lann> and the user does not want them
[00:36:58] <Cork> Lann: no, cause it shows content from a third party that INTEND to show it to the user
[00:37:02] <Lann> therefore google adsense is illegal
[00:37:17] <xec_> Taggnostr: you need jquery to run jquery code :p http://jsfiddle.net/K69WA/1/
[00:37:22] <Taggnostr> xec_, forgot to load jquery, it seems to work now
[00:37:26] <xec_> :D
[00:37:27] <Cork> Lann: no, cause the third party's connection is used to what it was intended for
[00:37:34] <Cork> there's a huge difference there
[00:37:36] <Lann> that's what i said
[00:37:43] <Lann> SETI could fit into that logic
[00:37:50] <Lann> probably so could bitcoin mining
[00:37:57] <Lann> not that it'd be effective
[00:38:13] <Cork> that doesn't sounds like it is what the user intended with the link no
[00:38:23] <Lann> neither are advertisements :-p
[00:38:35] <xec_> intent really has everything to do with it. advertisements does not compare
[00:38:39] <Lann> that's my point, user's intent cannot be defined
[00:38:44] <Cork> well the user agrees to seeing the advertisings
[00:38:50] <Lann> no they dont
[00:38:57] <Lann> they click a link
[00:39:01] <Cork> yes, cause they can opt out if they want
[00:39:19] <xec_> anyway, this is way off topic
[00:39:24] <Cork> though yes, it isn't really exposed how you do it
[00:39:24] <Lann> hahaha that implies that google creates the laaw
[00:39:29] <Cork> and yes offtopic
[00:39:34] <Cork> O_o
[00:39:48] <Cork> Lann: read up on what the law is before saying that...
[00:39:51] <Lann> so if i make a bruteforce script that you can opt out of on my site, by that logic it's ok
[00:39:54] * Cork dropps the subject
[00:40:08] <Lann> which it obviously isnt
[00:40:09] <Lann> but ok
[00:40:30] <Taggnostr> now it works, thanks
[00:44:51] <melek> hello, i would like to use datatables to read odata from my sap service, but i needt to provide user and password, how to achieve that?
[00:50:50] <TonnyNerd> There is an easy way to convert a string to title case?
[00:51:13] <TonnyNerd> for example, 'tonny nerd' -> 'Tonny Nerd'?
[00:51:25] <Cork> not really
[00:51:29] <Cork> you would have to use regex
[00:51:32] <Lann> tonnynerd: css can
[00:53:04] <TonnyNerd> Lann, how?
[00:53:15] <Lann> ah, i misread that. you can only capitalize the first letter that way
[00:53:17] <Lann> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5577364/make-the-first-character-uppercase-in-css
[00:53:24] <Lann> there is no way for title case
[00:53:50] <_Jens> text-transform:capitalize; should do that Lann TonnyNerd or am I mistaken?
[00:53:57] <Lann> however writing if from scratch is trivial
[00:54:17] <Lann> split by space and capitalize each first letter then re-combine to string
[00:54:20] <j_wright> http://phpjs.org/functions/ucwords/ perhaps
[00:54:26] <seutje> yeah, capitalize does every first letter
[00:54:39] <Lann> well php has one yes
[00:54:43] <Lann> oh phpjs, neat
[00:54:51] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/wYMsY/
[00:54:51] <soee> is it possible to use: $(selector).serializeArray() on form fields to get array os selected fields only ?>
[00:55:06] <_Jens> text-transform: capitalize is what ucwords does...
[00:55:54] <Cork> ?eval 'tonny nerd'.replace(/(^[a-z]| [a-z])/g, function(str) { return str.toLocaleUpperCase(); })
[00:55:57] <bot-t> Cork: "Tonny Nerd"
[00:57:20] <rex> I have one form with i want to send ajax request using jquery so that i used "$('#btn').click(function() {     		$('#submit_add').ajaxForm(function() {                  alert("Thank you for your comment!");              });      	});" But getting error uncaught typeerror object object object has no method 'ajaxform'
[00:57:51] <Cork> rex: you can't loaded the ajaxForm plugin
[00:58:01] <Cork> also bind submit on the form, not click on the button
[00:58:44] <rex> @Cork but how ?
[00:58:52] <Cork> how what?
[00:59:14] <Cork> ajaxForm isn't a native function to jquery
[00:59:24] <Cork> so you need to load the plugin for it to work
[00:59:30] <rex> Ohh like that
[00:59:47] <rex> Okay so can you gIve me place from where i can get that plugins ?
[00:59:52] <Cork> no
[01:00:03] <Cork> never used it so not sure what ajaxForm is
[01:00:10] <Cork> ?g jquery.ajaxForm
[01:00:12] <rex> Ok
[01:00:12] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery Form Plugin - http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[01:00:26] <Cork> might be what you're looking for; no grantees
[01:01:11] <rex> I used that one
[01:01:58] <rex> Okay thank cork
[01:08:05] <amh345> what am i doing incorrect here?  I'm trying to populate the div above the link i click http://jsfiddle.net/GcdvN/1/
[01:08:38] <Lann> you know it's beer time when a typo costs you an hour
[01:14:48] <xhoy> i have a app with tabs, jquery tabs, for some reason thease tabs are ajaxed
[01:14:54] <xhoy> iand i cant find *WHERE* i define that...
[01:15:35] <xhoy> ow fack, when there is an URL in there it goes automagicaly :)
[01:15:53] <xhoy> oke, how do i prefent it from loading again when it has already loaded is content(cache)
[01:16:00] <xhoy> or how can i trow away the cahe?
[01:16:31] <xhoy> cache
[01:17:06] <xhoy> throw away :)
[01:32:06] <Nubcake> Hi guys, is anybody there to help?
[01:32:13] <Cork> ?ask
[01:32:14] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:34:33] <Nubcake> alright , i'm having an issue , pretty much the code is based on this http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/3/ so i just edited it there to show what's the exact problem.
[01:34:33] <Nubcake> now on hovering the arrow covers the link and it becomes unclickable , specially in the real code since every li has it's own image as bg , how do i fix that?
[01:35:23] <j3lte> z-index
[01:36:23] <Nubcake> thanks , j3lte , i'll try now
[01:37:21] <j3lte> that's my guess. Let's see...
[01:37:28] <Nubcake> j3lte , okay that a problem , now the arrow goes behind the main bg xD
[01:39:45] <noregret> I have several forms that i'm serializing in order to post, how can I edit some the data in the form before serializing and sending them?
[01:39:51] <Nubcake> mm , i guess z-index not gonna help since the navigation is based on png images , ant the arrow that moves is an image also , partly transparent one
[01:40:23] <Cork> ?.serializeArray @ noregret
[01:40:24] <bot-t> noregret, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[01:40:50] <henn1nk> Hello. I am building a simple lightbox in jQuery. But how can i stop loading the url in the link after clicking it?
[01:41:13] <Cork> henn1nk: event.preventDefault()
[01:41:16] <noregret> Cork: can I serialize() the serializeArray() ?
[01:41:22] <Cork> noregret: no need
[01:41:36] <Cork> just give the array to ajax and it will happily use it
[01:41:48] <henn1nk> thanks
[01:44:16] <noregret> Cork: ah cool, thanks
[01:52:30] <Nubcake> j3lte http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/8/ see what's the prob now?
[01:58:26] <reloadz> hi! I use detech to repisition my divs and .eq() to position where i want them, but after I use detach i run .index() and it retunr one position less then I have actualy... how can I re-read the now position with out refreshing page.....?
[01:59:30] <henn1nk> I have one problem now.. via css i set height 100% and position absolute for my lightbox div.. but the height is only my window height. any idea how to fix this?
[01:59:43] <reloadz> plz... alsk question if u are not quite sure what is the prblem...... I need this to be done my today and no onw can help me :(
[02:00:02] <reloadz> by*
[02:00:42] <Cork> relix: i don't think you can use index() while the elements is detached
[02:00:46] <Cork> *reloadz:
[02:00:57] <relix> you summoned me?
[02:01:00] <relix> ;)
[02:01:11] <malli> I am trying to change opacity of a nearby div when a div is hovered, this is how far I've come so far. http://jsfiddle.net/fKxnE/ What is the next step? I tried closest with no luck.
[02:01:13] <Cork> henn1nk: ya? 100% is of the parent
[02:01:18] <Cork> relix: sorry
[02:01:48] <Cork> malli: you want prev()
[02:02:40] <henn1nk> Cork: hm
[02:02:59] <reloadz> Cork: any suggestions? or u need more explenation for the problem?
[02:03:01] <Cork> henn1nk: if you want the div to take 100% of the content leave the height: as auto;
[02:03:06] <relix> Cork np
[02:03:19] <henn1nk> Cork: i would like to overlay the whole page
[02:03:34] <Cork> reloadz: why do you even need to detach the element before attaching it where you want it?
[02:03:59] <Cork> henn1nk: try position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
[02:04:50] <delboy1978uk1> morning chaps
[02:04:50] <Cork> henn1nk: alternatively you can have a look at position: fixed;
[02:04:54] <reloadz> I have products that have psotitions... so I write new position and it detaches from current one and places it in the correct place...
[02:04:59] <Cork> though then it will be fixed to the viewport
[02:05:18] <Cork> reloadz: just find where you want it and attach it
[02:05:21] <Cork> no need for detach
[02:06:18] <henn1nk> Cork: fixed doesnt work :(
[02:07:23] <Cork> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/JFLNA/
[02:08:50] <reloadz> ok! i have 30 products... product 10 I need as 21... var ss = $(product).detech(); $(divs....).eq(19).after(ss);
[02:09:00] <reloadz> Cork: ^
[02:09:25] <Cork> $(divs).eq(19).after(product)
[02:09:52] <reloadz> ?
[02:10:15] <Cork> or if you meant product is a number
[02:10:34] <Cork> var divs = $(''); divs.eq(19).after(divs.eq(product))
[02:11:07] <Cork> reloadz: an element can only exist in one place in the dom
[02:11:08] <Nubcake> Please someone help me, the original navigation is based on this code http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/8/
[02:11:08] <Nubcake> now as you can see z-index does not help it makes the "moving arrow" disappear behind the main menu background,
[02:11:08] <Nubcake> what i want is to keep links above the arrow that moves on hovering
[02:11:08] <Nubcake> right now the arrow covers the links and they just become unclickable when the arrow is already on the spot... so the arrow must be somewhere betweet the background to the links , the question is , how?? ;(
[02:11:19] <Cork> reloadz: so you don't need the entire detatch part
[02:11:34] <Cork> *detach
[02:12:54] <xec_> Nubcake: you can't do that ;)
[02:13:19] <Nubcake> xec_: so what should i do ? :s
[02:13:53] <xec_> Nubcake: if you want a background on *some of the links* and still have the highlight below and visible, the background needs to be behind that again (on a separate element)
[02:14:30] <Cork> well you could use multible backgrounds
[02:14:52] <xec_> Cork: but the highlighter will be behind
[02:14:57] <reloadz> Cork: sry! I failed with selector.... so that is the reason i got wrong data back :)
[02:15:35] <Cork> reloadz: cause when you detach the element is removed from the page
[02:15:44] <Cork> so all other elements will jump up one step
[02:15:55] <Cork> reloadz: if you just take the list and move the element
[02:16:03] <Cork> the index won't change before the move has happened
[02:16:57] <Nubcake> woah , im so confused , no idea what to do , well i have an idea of making another <ul> above all that , just invisible clickable boxes , but that would be kinda stupid code :S
[02:18:02] <Cork> reloadz: what i mean is i don't give you a solution for how you did it, i gave you a simplified solution where the problem doens't exist
[02:23:37] <ak5> hey guys, I want to find all the elements that have a certain (computed) value for the css property "color:"
[02:24:10] <ak5> even if they are different (rgb, name, html code, etc)
[02:24:14] <ak5> can this be done?
[02:25:01] <xec_> Nubcake: well, transparent background is an option http://jsfiddle.net/sjWa7/9/
[02:25:19] <xec_> not great, but..
[02:25:23] <soee> hi, if ia have to date fields with values that match pttern: yyyy-mm-dd how can i compare 2 dates if one is bigger or smaller ?
[02:29:27] <xec_> soee: i'd just remove the dashes and do a straight compare, should work i think
[02:30:56] <xec_> ?eval "2013-12-29".replace(/-/g,"")
[02:30:58] <bot-t> xec_: "20131229"
[02:31:16] <xec_> ?eval "20131229" > "20131129"

[02:31:25] <xec_> ?eval "20131229" > "20141129"

[02:31:49] <bot-t> Cork: false
[02:31:51] <xec_> hehe right
[02:31:59] <Cork> opps
[02:32:04] <xec_> dont need to strip the dashes
[02:32:05] <Cork> ?eval "2013-11-29" > "2013-10-29"
[02:32:06] <bot-t> Cork: true
[02:32:26] <xec_> just compare them
[02:32:27] <xec_> :P
[02:32:32] <Cork> the magic of js

[02:45:38] <gavrochel> Hello. I have a <div> inside another <div>. How can I apply animate() only to the parent <div> ?

The slider at the bottom of the page is simply not working, and I can't figure it out (http://www.nobleluxe.com/author/redacao/).

[02:50:25] <gavrochel> yes henn1nk but it is now eorking
[02:50:44] <henn1nk> gavrochel: yeah, because i corrected it? :P
[02:52:04] <gavrochel> henn1nk no. I want only the parent <div> to be transparent
[02:52:18] <gavrochel> not the child <div>
[02:52:21] <henn1nk> gavrochel: parent or child?
[02:52:27] <gavrochel> only the parent

[02:54:55] <henn1nk> why is the div lightbox not inserted befor my link
[02:54:56] <henn1nk> ?
[02:58:00] <henn1nk> sorry this: http://jsfiddle.net/aNzns/1/
[02:59:11] <gavrochel> henn1nk I sure hope you're not asking me :-))
[02:59:28] <henn1nk> i am asking everyone here :)
[03:04:27] <Cork> henn1nk: you don't have any #lightbox element in the page
[03:04:45] <henn1nk> Cork: don"t i insert it with before?
[03:05:07] <Cork> henn1nk: there at least isn't any code to do that in the jsfiddle
[03:05:32] <henn1nk> Cork: can't i insert a div element with jquery?
[03:05:39] <Cork> sure
[03:05:44] <Cork> but then you need to create the element
[03:05:46] <Cork> and you arn't
[03:05:48] <henn1nk> Cork: but how?\
[03:06:07] <Cork> $('<div/>', { id: 'lightbox' }) for example
[03:06:28] <Cork> or how i prefer to write it $('<div/>').attr('id', 'lightbox')
[03:07:09] <henn1nk> hm don't work :p
[03:07:32] <Cork> did you insert the element in the page?
[03:08:02] <henn1nk> Cork: you mean in html?
[03:08:15] <Cork> that is one option, but no
[03:08:27] <henn1nk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/aNzns/2/
[03:08:32] <Cork> $('<div/>').attr('id', 'lightbox') creates the element, but it isn't attached in the dom yet
[03:09:03] <Cork> henn1nk: line 20 creates an element of type div with an id lightbox
[03:09:15] <Cork> and then it gets queued for gc
[03:09:19] <Cork> as you don't do anything with it
[03:09:36] <henn1nk> doesn't understand this :/
[03:09:54] <Cork> henn1nk: sounds like you need to read up on dom and how dom elements work
[03:10:43] <Cork> $('<div/>', { id: 'lightbox' }) is basically the same as var elm = document.createElement('div'); elm.id = 'lightbox';
[03:10:52] <Cork> but that just creates an element
[03:11:06] <Cork> that element needs to be attached to the document for it to be visible
[03:11:40] <Cork> henn1nk: and var container = $(options.container); becomes a bit weird if you plan to create the element in js
[03:11:53] <henn1nk> hmm
[03:12:07] <Cork> if you want to create the element if the selector fails; you should do something like
[03:12:28] <Cork> if(container.length < 1) { container = $('<div/>', { id: 'lightbox' }); }
[03:12:46] <Cork> but then you need to deside where you append the element to the current page
[03:13:34] <Cork> henn1nk: ex. http://jsfiddle.net/aNzns/3/
[03:13:36] <henn1nk> Cork: i thought before obj
[03:13:59] <Cork> henn1nk: elements isn't created automgically
[03:14:05] <Cork> you need to create them; or they need to exist
[03:14:29] <gavrochel> Cork when you have the time please look at this http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/qxaYF/3/
[03:15:15] <Cork> gavrochel: you can't make just a parent transparent
[03:15:25] <henn1nk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/aNzns/4/
[03:15:34] <Cork> gavrochel: if you change the opacity of an element, all child elements gets it too
[03:15:54] <Cork> gavrochel: there is two options, change the background and color, of the parent
[03:16:13] <Cork> gavrochel: or make the parent an underlay instead of a parent
[03:16:45] <Cork> henn1nk: that will be invalid
[03:17:10] <henn1nk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/aNzns/5/ jshint says it is ok
[03:17:12] <Cork> cause you will create one element for each link in the page, they would all have the same id (and id's need to be uniq)
[03:17:27] <Cork> the js is, but the generated html isn't
[03:17:36] <Cork> or rather the generated dom isn't
[03:18:51] <henn1nk> Cork: but there is no way to click the link several times
[03:19:12] <Cork> henn1nk: this.each will loop each element matched by .lightbox
[03:19:24] <Cork> and you will create one container for each one of them
[03:19:58] <Cork> ah, sorry missed that you ran .lightbox in the click handler
[03:20:08] <henn1nk> :)
[03:20:14] <henn1nk> Cork: thanks so much.
[03:20:16] <Cork> well the comment is still correct
[03:20:37] <Cork> as the this.each will break the validity of the dom unless you never use it?
[03:22:30] <henn1nk> no idea
[03:24:19] <noregret> how can I remove an item from a serializeArray() with a certain name/value ?
[03:25:27] <Cork> noregret: delete arr[i]
[03:27:52] <noregret> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/gwHNt2bPb3zJBrZ6bdBH/ i'm getting an error when doing that
[03:30:43] <soee> if element has assigned datepicker() can i get access to this datepicker instance when doing some changes in different element ?
[03:36:39] <Cork> noregret: ah, ya, you can't do delete in a $.each loop
[03:38:28] <noregret> Cork: should I do a for loop ?
[03:38:40] <Cork> $.grep(forms, function(elm) { return field.name.search('IPTag') == -1 || (field.value !== '' || field.value != 0); })
[03:38:53] <Cork> opps
[03:38:56] <Cork> $.grep(forms, function(field) { return field.name.search('IPTag') == -1 || (field.value !== '' || field.value != 0); })
[03:39:07] <Cork> bah
[03:39:12] <Cork> $.grep(forms, function(field) { return field.name.search('IPTag') == -1 || (field.value !== '' && field.value != 0); })
[03:39:50] <noregret> i thnk it's first && then ||
[03:40:05] <Cork> noregret: if you check again, i reverted the entire statement
[03:40:46] <noregret> I meant $.grep(forms, function(field) { return field.name.search('IPTag') == -1 && (field.value !== '' || field.value != 0); })
[03:41:04] <noregret> ahh yes yea sorry
[03:41:05] <Cork> that would only keep the empty elements
[03:41:14] <noregret> i didn't notice ==-1
[03:41:36] <noregret> nice thanks, never used grep before here
[03:41:48] <Cork> test if first :)
[03:42:05] <Cork> i just typed that from memory so it might be wrong
[03:45:29] <noregret> yeah sure
[03:52:45] <anton164> Hi guys, I have an on('change.wizard'), when something happens specific happens, I want to unbind the event. $(this).off(); within the callback would normally suffice, however I don't want to unbind all of the events
[03:53:06] <anton164> I've tried $(this).off('.wizard'); but that doesn't seem to cut it
[03:53:26] <Cork> anton164: is the event listener delegated?
[03:53:40] <anton164> delegated?
[03:53:46] <Cork> $().on('change.wizard', '<selector>')
[03:54:03] <ph88> $('#div1').find('> *');   <-- does this select every child in div1 ?
[03:54:14] <anton164> Cork, yes it is
[03:54:15] <Cork> ?.children @ ph88
[03:54:16] <bot-t> ph88, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[03:54:28] <Cork> anton164: then you can't unbind it like that
[03:54:32] <ph88> hhmm ye that's definatelly more conveniant ^^
[03:54:49] <Cork> anton164: cause there isn't a specific listener for each element
[03:55:06] <Cork> anton164: an alternative is to add a class to the element, and then remove/add it to filter the event
[03:55:28] <anton164> Hmm yeah, I see what you're getting at
[03:56:32] <anton164> What about undelegate? Could that work? I'm just reading up on delegated events now as you mentioned it
[03:56:59] <Cork> it would kill the event listener for all elements
[03:57:08] <Cork> (remember there is only one)
[03:57:46] <anton164> But I do want to kill change.wizard for all elements in this special occurence
[03:57:55] <Cork> anton164: also you would have to bind the event listener again to enable it again
[03:58:17] <anton164> Yes, but that actually works for me then, that is what I'm doing
[03:58:30] <Cork> anton164: well ya you can do it like that
[03:58:41] <Cork> anton164: though i would prob recommend to have a check instead
[03:58:47] <Cork> but it is up to you
[03:58:54] <Cork> (both work)
[03:59:19] <anton164> Yeah, but I bind it every time, and I think undelegate is what I'm looking for, thanks for the help :)

[04:13:44] <RCCCC> hi
[04:13:59] <RRC> Trading for a living
[04:20:32] <otiuk> i have jquery append a li to a sortable ul and the appended content are text fields.. and it shows up in firefox but i can't seem to click on them and type anything.. any idea why that would happen with a sortable ul
[04:22:38] <moijk> sounds like you got some debugging to do.
[04:24:41] <otiuk> moijk: yes i know this
[04:24:57] <counterj> Hi ..
[04:25:10] <otiuk> the thing is it works perfect in every other browser but firefox .. i'm thinking it has something to do with the sortable ul
[04:25:22] <otiuk> even though it has a handler
[04:25:34] <counterj> I am having issues updating text dynamically after retrieving a value from DB
[04:26:44] <counterj> $("#price").load("getter.php?choice=" + escape($("#sides").val()) + "&fetch=price");
[04:27:01] <counterj> #price is a div with <h2>text</h2> in it
[04:27:40] <counterj> when executed it just removes text and doesn't replaces it with the value from DB
[04:28:52] <moijk> otiuk: feel free to hit me with a demo of your problem. firefox is my browser of choice and i do sortables from time to time and it have never been a problem. right now i'm doing one with inputs.
[04:29:32] <otiuk> ok i'll make it up in jsfiddle quick
[04:30:19] <otiuk> wanted to see if it could be something else anyway.. lemme set it up quick
[04:31:56] <optraz> how to access json with space?

[04:35:38] <counterj> ??
[04:35:59] <amaroks> optraz: np
[04:36:11] <counterj> how can i load a value from database and replace a text with it
[04:36:26] <counterj> $("#price").text(function() {load("getter.php?choice=" + escape($("#sides").val()) + "&fetch=price"); });
[04:36:29] <counterj> doesn't seems to work as well
[04:36:55] <otiuk> moijk:  had disableSelection on and once i removed that all is well... hah glad it was that simple
[04:37:23] <counterj> its an urgent task and i am stuck :(
[04:37:50] <moijk> otiuk: lol, now that was an obvious flaw
[04:38:05] <otiuk> haha ya
[04:46:07] <benjaminbenben> counterj you want to do the request first, then update the price when it comes back - $.get("getter.php?choice=" + escape($("#sides").val()) + "&fetch=price").then(function(response){ $("#price").text(response); })
[04:47:52] <benjaminbenben> you might also want to use $.get params rather than building up the url the way you are - $.get("getter.php", {choice:$("#sides").val(), fetch:"price"})
[04:48:57] <Krambiorix> hi , i use hotkeys plugin to add some shortcut functionalities. Everything works but when i eg. push Ctrl+b , my bookmark panel opens and after that the function is executed. I tried to put preventDefault before my code, but still the bookmarks panel opens... What am i doing wrong?
[04:49:56] <counterj> benjaminbenben: it just keeps throwing me zero
[04:50:12] <counterj> if ($fetch == "price") $query = "SELECT TOP 1 price FROM a5letterhead WHERE sides='$choice'";
[04:50:24] <counterj> if ($fetch == "price") echo $row{'price'};
[04:50:40] <counterj> the later one under a while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { loop
[04:51:57] <counterj> benjaminbenben: do you want me to share the complete codes?
[04:52:04] <benjaminbenben> $row{'price'}; ==> $row['price']; (square brackets)?
[04:53:03] <counterj> benjaminbenben: <br /> <b>Warning</b>: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in <b>C:\xampp\htdocs\test\getter.php</b> on line <b>18</b><br />
[04:54:09] <counterj> i don't think there is a difference between the two brackets?
[04:54:53] <sammich> what two brackets?
[04:54:53] <benjaminbenben> counterj - might be a failing query http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973202/mysql-fetch-array-expects-parameter-1-to-be-resource-boolean-given-in-select
[04:55:10] <counterj> i was reading the same page actually
[04:55:22] <sammich> okay, not js ;)
[04:56:37] <counterj> okay just for the sake of testing, i'll get rid of the query
[04:58:48] <benjaminbenben> counterj - good plan / good luck. Also check out .load, you could have - $("#price").load("getter.php", {choice:$("#sides").val(), fetch:"price"})

[05:06:21] <Cork> Krambiorix: sounds like you have some css matching it that shouldn't
[05:06:42] <Cork> Krambiorix: or actually might be the other way around :)
[05:12:31] <lenswipee> Cork: I want to use jQuery to automatically accept a self signed certification on my front page login.
[05:12:45] <Cork> O_o
[05:12:55] <Cork> lenswipee: js has nothing to do with security
[05:13:03] <Cork> your looking in the wrong place
[05:13:32] <Cork> lenswipee: btw why don't you just get a signed certificate?
[05:13:41] <lenswipee> Cork: You know a self signed cert gives a warning, and so user has no manually accept the cert or not
[05:13:45] <Cork> (they are free after all)
[05:13:59] <Cork> lenswipee: yes, and content (the page) can't interact with it
[05:14:01] <lenswipee> Cork: I was told there are no free cert
[05:14:05] <Cork> there is
[05:14:24] <Cork> ?g starcom free cert
[05:14:25] <bot-t> Cork, StartCom Free SSL Certification Authority - http://cert.startcom.org/
[05:14:59] <lenswipee> Cork: Is a that totally free and not dodgy?
[05:15:06] <Cork> yes
[05:15:35] <Cork> you can't get wildcard or code signing certs though
[05:15:41] <lenswipee> Cork: People in ##PHP argued "Why would anyone pay for a cert when there are free ones"
[05:15:42] <Cork> only one domain ssl cert
[05:16:05] <Cork> lenswipee: cause it is only the simplest form of cert you can get
[05:16:21] <Cork> and you can't get for longer then 12 months
[05:16:27] <lenswipee> Cork: I understand wildcard, but not code signing cert? what you mean by that?
[05:16:33] <Cork> (after 12 months it expires and you need to get a new one)
[05:16:54] <Cork> lenswipee: you know like how the installation exe file is signed my microsoft for example
[05:17:01] <Cork> in other words not web related
[05:17:19] <Cork> and you can't get eva cert from starcom free either
[05:18:18] <Cork> lenswipee: basically if your ok with the cert needing to be replaced every 12 months; only the simplest form of check (no green bar), and only for one site
[05:18:23] <Cork> starcom free works just fine
[05:18:58] <lenswipee> Cork: what you mean by simplest form of check?
[05:19:09] <Croves> Hey guys! I'm having some troubles with my code. I have a AJAX call that returns me all the new interactions from my webchat system. I need to get this response and add a nem <li> with the info of this interaction. I don't know why, but my code just does not work as expected.
[05:19:12] <Croves> Here it is: http://pastebin.com/CGnbd0VJ
[05:19:46] <Croves> My responde is something like this: {"salas":[{"id":"29","nome":"Gabriel Ramos","email":"gabriel@ramos.com.br","regiao":"Matriz Nacional","assunto":"D\u00favidas #1"}],"mensagens":[]}
[05:19:46] <Cork> lenswipee: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ vs https://www.paypal.com/
[05:20:36] <lenswipee> Cork: is it always geotrsut global?
[05:20:36] <Cork> Cronoh: what mimetype is the server setting (content-type)
[05:20:50] <Cork> lenswipee: no, its from starcom; obvious
[05:20:58] <Cork> +ly
[05:21:17] <lenswipee> Cork: the mozilla one says geotrust global
[05:21:26] <Cork> lenswipee: but check the look in the urlbar and you see the difference between simple and extended checks
[05:21:55] <lenswipee> Cork: okay
[05:23:03] <lenswipee> Cork: basicallly it will be for one domain and used for ssl for front page login. so this free one from startcom fits the bill?
[05:23:17] <Cork> lenswipee: yes
[05:23:39] <Cork> lenswipee: basically every situations where a self signed cert is enough, a starcom free cert will work
[05:24:16] <lenswipee> Cork: Sounds pretty good. except for the 12 months renewal
[05:24:37] <lenswipee> Cork: but the renewal maybe for security reasons i suppose
[05:25:00] <Cork> 12months is quite common for all end user certs
[05:25:38] <lenswipee> Cork: oh really? i didn't know that. then its totally cool
[05:25:58] <Cork> lenswipee: if you buy a normal cert it is 12 months
[05:26:01] <lenswipee> Cork: i'm glad we had this chat. i hope it's easy to setup
[05:26:12] <Cork> some can issue longer certs but those cost more
[05:27:22] <Cork> lenswipee: heres a comparison list http://www.startssl.com/?app=39
[05:29:01] <lenswipee> Cork: what's the association between startssl TM and startcom?
[05:30:30] <Cork> lenswipee: starcom is the ones running starssl, not sure what tm is though
[05:30:58] <Cork> ah
[05:31:06] <Cork> lenswipee: that form of tm :)
[05:31:24] <Cork> lenswipee: startssl is a product branch in starcom
[05:31:27] <Cork> bah...
[05:31:36] <Cork> starssl is a product branch in starcom
[05:32:08] <Cork> uh, no the first was right; funny i've always read it as starcom :D
[05:34:59] <lenswipee> lol, o_O
[05:35:23] <lenswipee> so startssl is a product branch of startcom?
[05:35:28] <Cork> yes
[05:36:00] <lenswipee> Cork: brilliant
[05:36:01] <Cork> did you even check the link i gave you? :D
[05:36:28] <lenswipee> Cork: hence why i asked the association
[05:39:17] <lenswipee> Cork: anyway, thank you.
[05:40:46] <dwarder> i have something like this $('#outer_div').on('click','#inner_div',function YADA YADA);   how do i programmaticaly trigger this click?
[05:41:03] <Cork> ?.click
[05:41:03] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[05:41:10] <Cork> bah
[05:41:25] <Cork> dwarder: $('#inner_div').click()
[05:41:51] <dwarder> Cork: i can disregard delegate in this case, right?
[05:41:58] <shoky> don't bah when you got it right, sir
[05:42:04] <shoky> save the bahs
[05:42:09] <Cork> :D
[05:42:25] <Cork> shoky: i got the binder not the trigger
[05:42:30] <shoky> check again!
[05:42:39] <Cork> :x
[05:42:47] <Cork> you're right
[05:43:20] <shoky> *unbah*
[05:43:25] <Cork> lol
[05:44:16] <dwarder> what is bah?
[05:44:18] <shoky> dwarder: yeah you can disregard it. (it'll still be delegated tho)
[05:44:27] <dwarder> shoky: thanks
[05:44:37] <lenswipee> Cork: why not $('#inner_div').trigger('click');
[05:44:46] <Cork> lenswipee: it's the same thing
[05:44:58] <dwarder> just what to understand you humor too :)
[05:45:02] <dwarder> your*
[05:45:08] <Cork> .click is a shorthand function for both .on('click', function() {}) and .trigger('click')
[05:45:19] <shoky> bah is a .. cry of frustration?
[05:45:25] <shoky> a mild one
[05:45:25] <Cork> ya
[05:46:09] <dwarder> bah i din't know it :)
[05:46:21] <shoky> ;p
[05:46:25] <Cork> ?g dictionary bah
[05:46:27] <bot-t> Cork, bah - definition of bah by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and ... - http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bah

[05:48:22] <sammich> totally worked
[05:49:38] <shoky> ?backpat
[05:49:38] <bot-t> I think you are a terrible person for trying to sarcastically congratulate someone. You should be ashamed.
[05:50:01] <Cork> heh
[05:51:44] <xec_> lol
[05:56:00] <xec_> for a channel filled with almost 900 geeks, i find it surprisingly pleasant
[05:56:33] <xec_> and informative. i had no idea "bah" was an actual word
[05:56:35] <anton164> I have a function, .load() which contains many functions, I know if I write .load, it simply 'echoes' the functions, would it be possible to count the number of functions within .load somehow?
[05:57:34] <xec_> .load() a.k.a. the jquery method?
[05:57:38] <brettster> anyone in here from the dc area?
[05:57:45] <xec_> or do you have a custom load() function
[05:58:49] <anton164> custom load function
[05:59:06] <anton164> I'm guessing it's more of a javascript question, when you said it like that
[05:59:23] <xec_> load.toString().match(/function/g).length-1
[05:59:26] <xec_> hehe
[05:59:36] <anton164> thanks :)
[05:59:43] <xec_> that won't really work
[06:00:00] <anton164> Yeah, I just figured
[06:00:06] <anton164> because all of the functions within functions are also counted
[06:00:06] <xec_> it just turns the entire function into a string, looks for the word "function" ;)
[06:00:31] <anton164> but I know what word to look for in order to count them
[06:00:41] <anton164> So you pointed me in the right direction anyway, cheers
[06:00:43] <xec_> i dont't think there's a function-count... why do you want that, by the way?`
[06:01:50] <anton164> Basically my load function contains tons of steps in a web wizard, currently, the whole wizard doesn't have any indexing system or count of how many wizard steps there are
[06:02:06] <anton164> Each step starts with createGuider, so by looking for that I can count them
[06:02:33] <xec_> sounds like a mess ;)
[06:03:12] <anton164> Yeah, it kind of is
[06:03:48] <anton164> Thanks, anyway, I learnt something, I'll be thinking of another way to approach it though
[06:07:54] <VipConsult> $(".play").click(function() { $(this).load($(this).attr("id"));});  when the element is clicked it loads the content , but scrolls page up
[06:08:38] <VipConsult> <a class="play" href="javascript:void(0);" id="/player/index/file" >Play</a>
[06:08:55] <VipConsult> I have about 50 of these element on the same page
[06:09:10] <VipConsult> I wonder why it scrolls up when I click play.
[06:14:21] <xec_> VipConsult: <a href="#test"> links to the element on the page with ID "test" and will scroll there.
[06:14:41] <xec_> VipConsult: <a href="#"> links to, well, nothing and will scroll to top of document
[06:15:10] <xec_> VipConsult: you can prevent the default behaviour by calling .preventDefault() on the event object
[06:15:27] <VipConsult> but the href on my link is javascript:void
[06:16:13] <xec_> lol i missed that part
[06:16:18] <VipConsult> the id is different on all play links
[06:16:39] <VipConsult> and the id includes the content to be loaded
[06:16:58] <xec_> and tries to insert it into the <a> ??
[06:17:03] <VipConsult> yes
[06:17:11] <xec_> is that intended?
[06:17:11] <VipConsult> it does work , but scrolld the page up a bit
[06:17:31] <VipConsult> yes click play -> load flash player
[06:17:39] <xec_> inside the link.
[06:17:41] <xec_> really?
[06:17:53] <VipConsult> these are call logs and if I load the player at page load it loads about 100 players and it loads slow
[06:18:12] <VipConsult> so the player loads only when you click play
[06:18:32] <xec_> but why are you inserting it inside of the link you click, seems very strange
[06:19:17] <VipConsult> wy not ? it rmeoves the work Play and insert the actual player instead
[06:19:30] <VipConsult> <VipConsult> wy not ? it removes the workdPlay and insert the actual player instead
[06:19:36] <VipConsult> <VipConsult> wy not ? it removes the word Play and insert the actual player instead
[06:19:59] <xec_> you can usually press arrow up in IRC clients to get your last message
[06:20:29] <VipConsult> yeah , I keep forgetting.
[06:20:33] <xec_> anyway, there are buttons etc inside the player right? that you want to click? and each click is going to trigger the click handler again?
[06:21:06] <VipConsult> hm , good point
[06:21:11] <VipConsult> actually it works fine
[06:21:21] <VipConsult> the payer is flash based
[06:21:36] <VipConsult> I can contorl it fine and it doesn't reload the content
[06:21:53] <xec_> i guess the plugin captures the click
[06:21:59] <VipConsult> yes
[06:22:05] <VipConsult> the main problem is the initial load
[06:22:12] <xec_> well, in any case you can try the preventDefault and see if it helps
[06:22:20] <xec_> i don't see any reason why it should scroll tbh
[06:22:50] <VipConsult> I even tried using a <span element instead of <a
[06:22:52] <VipConsult> same thing
[06:23:14] <VipConsult> let me try loading the content outside the calling element
[06:24:26] <xec_> also, it would be useful to see the issue first hand
[06:24:35] <xec_> if you got a live url?
[06:34:54] <darkfrog> can you reliably set arbitrary HTML attributes and then read them back via attr() in all browsers?  I was thinking that some browsers filter that information out?
[06:36:00] <Cork> darkfrog: yes, as long as you use the dedicated namespace data-
[06:36:17] <Cork> if you don't your bound for problems down the road
[06:36:26] <darkfrog> Cork: so all attribute names need to be prefixed with "data-"?
[06:36:27] <xec_> you're
[06:36:38] <Cork> data-custom-attribute="" yes
[06:36:56] <darkfrog> that's less elegant, but acceptable. :)
[06:37:22] <Cork> darkfrog: a plus side is that you can read it with .data('custom-attribute') :)
[06:37:30] <darkfrog> ah
[06:37:41] <Cork> set is another matter though
[06:38:05] <darkfrog> I can't just set it back with data?
[06:38:19] <Cork> darkfrog: .data uses a cache
[06:38:31] <Cork> so when you have read the html content once it won't touch it again
[06:38:38] <darkfrog> so the attribute is just a convenience method for getting it into the cache
[06:38:41] <VipConsult> xec_, http://portal.vip-consult.co.uk/
[06:38:44] <Cork> and if you set it through .data it will store it internally not in the attribute
[06:39:15] <darkfrog> if I set it via e.attr("data-custom-attribute", "new value") it will though, right?
[06:39:18] <Cork> darkfrog: well .data works like that; the data- namespace is specified in the html spec, and doesn't really have anything to do with .data
[06:39:27] <Cork> darkfrog: yes
[06:39:43] <darkfrog> will setting it with attr update .data as well?
[06:39:47] <Cork> no
[06:39:55] <Cork> not unless you haven't read it with .data before
[06:40:02] <darkfrog> so to read it I can use data, but to write it reliably I need to set data and attr?
[06:40:27] <Cork> darkfrog: if you need it to actually be in the dom element you need to use attr
[06:40:43] <Cork> darkfrog: .data will reliably read and set it, just not in the dom element
[06:40:47] <darkfrog> so perhaps I shouldn't use .data at all?
[06:40:54] <darkfrog> I need it in the dom
[06:40:59] <Cork> then you need .attr
[06:41:25] <Cork> most of the time you only need the attr to deliver the initial data when the page loads
[06:42:14] <Cork> .data supports json parsing and a few other nifty things, so it offers you more then what .attr can give
[06:42:51] <Cork> heh a good way to annoy your users... http://jsfiddle.net/Ahmcz/6/
[06:43:15] <darkfrog> hehe
[06:43:47] <darkfrog> well, this is a web site builder, so I actually care about the data in the dom
[06:44:46] <cyrano> hi guy.. how to make single-page applications by using jquery?
[06:47:01] <Cork> cyrano: that question is VERY generic
[06:47:49] <Cork> cyrano: to make some form of summary: 1. load the first page, then through $().load or $.ajax replace parts of the page as the user navigates around
[06:48:07] <cyrano> Cork: ok... i'm looking for a "pure" jquery framework that implements a MVC pattern because i want an easy way to deal with routing, templates, and so on...
[06:48:07] <Cork> *, 2. then through
[06:48:34] <Cork> you don't normally deal with routing in js
[06:48:59] <cyrano> Cork: oh yes, you can... take a look at angularjs, emberjs, backbonejs, and so on
[06:49:01] <Cork> all you need to make ajax based page updates work is like 5 lines of jquery and server code
[06:49:16] <Cork> cyrano: can != normally do
[06:49:42] <Cork> there is no reason to move the logic out from the low cost end (server) to the client
[06:49:50] <Cork> (browser)
[06:50:22] <Cork> all the server have to do is detect when it's an ajax request and send only the part of the page needed
[06:50:26] <cyrano> Cork: did you know angularjs ?
[06:50:41] <Cork> cyrano: i know of it, but no i'm no expert in it
[06:50:57] <Cork> i find libs that move server code out into js to be; less then what i desire
[06:51:02] <cyrano> Cork: ok, i'm looking for an alternative to angularjs
[06:51:41] <Cork> well i don't know of any such lib that is built around jquery specifically no
[06:52:59] <cyrano> Cork: never mind man thank you
[06:57:01] <hkraal> I've 3 input fields, the "name" field will fill up a select list "address" which fills up fine but I've a 3rd select list which doesn't act on the .change() function. I expect this is a common problem but I'm not sure how to google for this, anyone familiar with this behaviour?
[06:57:43] <hkraal> *which doesn't act on the .change() function of address when I select an entry
[06:59:29] <_rgn> "select jquery change event"
[07:16:27] <Brutick> Hello everyone, I'm currently experiencing an issue with jQuery on IE9. I'll do my best to explain the problem in simple terms. I currently have a jQuery/jQuery UI modal dialog which is created on click of a link (jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ANNdt/ ). Assume that this link appears on all pages in the sub-navigation. It appears that when a user uses my navigation bar to switch to a different page, i.e. switching from Page 1 to Pag
[07:16:35] <Brutick> the dialog will no longer create after the page has loaded, but interestingly, if you refresh the page, then tada! the code works again. I suspect this is due to the $(document).ready() not executing or being called at the right time. Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Where the code just does not execute after page load, but does on page refresh?
[07:18:18] <j3lte> why use $.one('click" ?
[07:18:25] <basss> hello, is there any scrollers in jquery ? i want to create a section in my page that is scrollable (and compatible with mobiles)
[07:18:28] <j3lte> instead of .on("click
[07:18:37] <Cork> j3lte: if you only want the event listener to trigger once and then unbind
[07:18:53] <Brutick> Exactly, Cork.
[07:18:55] <j3lte> yeah I was refering to Brutick jsfiddle
[07:19:47] <Cork> but ya, it seams kinda weird if the links stop working if you click them
[07:19:47] <Brutick> j3lte: I don't want the data on the form to stick around on postbacks, nor to I want it to stick around after a user closes the dialog. it's just me being nit picky.
[07:20:21] <Cork> Brutick: .one has nothing to do with the dialog sticking around
[07:20:51] <Brutick> Cork: what would you recommend I do? Use .on() instead?
[07:21:11] <Cork> Brutick: if you want the event handler that shows the dialog to keep working; ya
[07:21:56] <Brutick> Cork: Ah, okay. Let me give it a try, sorry... I'm kind of a jQuery noob, leveraging examples and such.
[07:22:59] <j3lte> Brutick, that was my point. I mean, use .on(). You might have to clear the form on .dialog.close if you want to make sure no data is on the form anymore
[07:24:32] <Brutick> j3lte, Cork: Ah okay, I see. And now it appears to be working. Now that I think of it, the .on() makes sense as opposed to .one(). Very strange though, this issue was only limited to IE 9, it actually worked fine in compatibility mode and on chrome. Thanks for the help! :)
[07:24:51] <Croves> Can I do this? $('a[href="#' + tab_id + '"]').addClass('nova-msg');
[07:24:53] <Croves> I need
[07:25:09] <Croves> I need to get the link with href="#tab29" and add a class to it.
[07:25:12] <Cork> href$=
[07:25:27] <j3lte> Brutick: LOL I always hate debugging jQuery on IE. Strange 'problems' that do not arise in things like Chrome
[07:25:33] <Cork> an if its just the #tab29 in there it would work with plain href=
[07:26:01] <Cork> j3lte: ya, ie's debug tools is more behind then the rest of the browser
[07:26:13] <Croves> Cork tab29 was a example‚Ä¶ I have a AJAX call that return me an integer, and this integer is the numeric ID of this tab, you know what I mean?
[07:26:25] <Cork> Cronoh: yes
[07:26:43] <Cork> Cronoh: but i meant in contrast to <a href="something#tab29">
[07:27:11] <Cork> but from what you typed it sounds like you want $('a[href="#tab' + tab_id + '"]').addClass('nova-msg');
[07:27:21] <Cork> but yes, the basic idea will work
[07:27:33] <Croves> Like, I have #tab29, #tab32, #tab130. I need to get the response from AJAX (it will be or 32, or 29 or 130), concat it and add a class to thisl ink
[07:27:49] <j3lte> Cork: do you think they will ever keep up? When I started as a front-end dev I used Firebug as my main debugger, later on... Chrome... but IE never gave me a decent debugger. Which sucks if you have clients that insist on getting a website working in IE8/IE9
[07:28:04] <Cork> j3lte: no i don't
[07:28:36] <Cork> j3lte: i hope they will get to a point where they won't block the adaptation of new features to the web for too long
[07:28:40] <Cork> but... will see
[07:28:43] <Croves> Cork I add the dollar sign to it, and it doesn work =(
[07:29:01] <Cork> Cronoh: the dollar sign isn't needed if its just that content
[07:29:05] <Croves> Oh, sorry
[07:29:11] <Cork> Cronoh: try $('a[href="#tab' + tab_id + '"]').addClass('nova-msg');
[07:29:13] <Croves> My bad, I forgot something
[07:29:21] <Croves> Now it's working :P
[07:31:19] <j3lte> Cork: I had a complete front-end that was based on Zurb Foundation 3, which had IE8 support. But debugging some strange errors in IE8 (don't get me started) was a two-week hair-pulling crash course in the Developer tools of IE. Never... again :p
[07:32:06] <Cork> j3lte: well have you ever had to provide support for ie 5.5 or ie6?
[07:32:27] <Cork> that... makes you feel like your time is really well spent...
[07:33:06] <Cork> for ie5.5 you couldn't even hack around the problems with just css
[07:33:13] <j3lte> Cork: Hell no! :p I had some websites that HAD to support IE7. We never supported IE6... due to the fact that it is... well... IE6. :p
[07:33:21] <Cork> (as hover and focus didn't work on none <a> tags...)
[07:33:29] <_rgn> if i ever had to do stuff for ie6 i'd look for a new job
[07:33:40] <j3lte> _rgn +1 :p
[07:33:40] <Cork> j3lte: you've not been around for very long then :)
[07:34:09] <Cork> i remember when ie4 was seen as the new fronter :)
[07:34:25] <Cork> and when ie5 came wow it made some nice strides >_>
[07:34:35] <j3lte> Cork that's true. I have been a developer for like 3 years as a fulltime job. Before that I used to build small websites, but I started learning JS/jQuery only four years ago
[07:34:41] <Cork> and then it won over netscape and the entire web development died
[07:35:00] <vPoint> $.get("getter.php?choice=" + escape($("#sides").val()) + "&fetch=price").then(function(response){ $("#price").text(response); }) << this gets executed on a change event, now after the event is executed value for a couple of dropdown menus are changed but this is returning me their "current" status and now the updated one .. what do i do so that it takes the latest values?
[07:36:02] <vPoint> http://pastebin.com/z1WhYaZU
[07:36:07] <Cork> vPoint:  $.get('getter.php', { choice: $("#sides").val(), fetch:'price' })
[07:36:11] <vPoint> this is the complete code
[07:36:19] <Cork> makes it easier and less escape junky
[07:36:26] <Cork> *easier to read
[07:37:26] <vPoint> yes, i tried this syntax .. makes it easier but does't resolves the issue :(
[07:37:29] <Cork> vPoint: where are you checking the this value?
[07:37:30] <j3lte> the amount of escapes in that code... wow :p
[07:37:55] <Cork> vPoint: i suspect you miss that ajax is async
[07:38:28] <Cork> wow...
[07:38:31] <Cork> wait a min
[07:38:40] <Cork> you have a ready wrapper in your change event...
[07:38:51] <Cork> that... doens't make sense at all
[07:39:27] <vPoint> test.html: http://pastebin.com/Ggk142gU and getter.php: http://pastebin.com/0GDU2pB2 << these are the complete two files i am working with
[07:39:49] <vPoint> Cork: part of my experimentation to try and resolve this issue
[07:40:05] <vPoint> Cork: but as you suspect, didnt resolve :)
[07:40:18] <Cork> escape($("#sides")) won't work
[07:40:25] <Croves> How do I select a div that have a # in your ID? Like, in my example, #tab29?
[07:40:32] <Croves> I have <div id="#tab29">
[07:40:41] <Croves> $('##tab29') ?
[07:40:51] <Krambiorix> can bind a click event on an element that doesn't exist yet?
[07:40:52] <ravenzz> that's not a valid id
[07:40:59] <Cork> $('#\#tab29') i suspect
[07:41:05] <Cork> but ya it's invalid
[07:41:24] <Cork> Krambiorix: yes, use delegate
[07:41:25] <shoky> \\
[07:41:34] <Cork> shoky: ah, true
[07:41:47] <Krambiorix> Cork, thanks
[07:41:57] <Krambiorix> Cork, when opening a dialog, i see the dialog first at the bottom of the window and after a small second on top of my window... How can i make it to be instantly at the top?
[07:42:12] <Croves> It is invalid? Twitter bootstrap use this mark in tabs
[07:42:35] <ravenzz> where? show me it
[07:42:58] <ravenzz> bootstrap doesn't implies best practices though
[07:42:59] <Cork> Croves: your code won't work at all
[07:43:07] <Cork> Croves: it's racy
[07:43:41] <Cork> Croves: you trigger an update or sevelar values through load() and then you try to use what it looks like there values in the .get call
[07:43:44] <Croves> Cork What you mean by 'racy'?
[07:43:54] <j3lte> Croves: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id <-- starting an ID with '#' is invalid
[07:43:55] <Cork> but without checking if the load calls has completed
[07:43:55] <vPoint> Cork: yes, i was getting just the first word .. i could play around with it but the main issue is the out-dated value, what do you suggest?
[07:44:18] <Cork> Croves: opps sorry wrong nick
[07:44:24] <Cork> >_<

[07:44:48] <Cork> oh man when did i mix up those nicks...
[07:44:51] * Cork scrolls back
[07:45:17] <Croves> j3lte Yeah you're right
[07:45:18] <Cork> Croves: ook, ignore what i sait to you after the #\# line...
[07:45:22] <Croves> I did it wrong here
[07:45:28] <Cork> it was all to the wrong nick
[07:45:31] <Croves> Cork It's ok man‚Ä¶ I apreciate your help
[07:45:40] <Cork> vPoint: ok, lets start this over
[07:45:50] <Croves> I said that I have a div with id="#tab21"
[07:45:54] <Croves> I was wrong :P
[07:45:59] <Croves> I add the # as a mistake :P
[07:46:00] <Cork> :)
[07:46:12] <vPoint> Cork: i've read everything you said to Croves and yes :) .. this is whats happening
[07:46:14] <Cork> vPoint: i suspect your loading new values in elements from the .load calls, and then your calling .get
[07:46:26] <vPoint> Cork: suspect? .. you have the codes :)
[07:46:41] <Cork> vPoint: ya, i don't have the html so i have to guess
[07:46:56] <vPoint> Cork: you don't?
[07:47:01] <vPoint> test.html: http://pastebin.com/Ggk142gU and getter.php: http://pastebin.com/0GDU2pB2 << these are the complete two files i am working with
[07:47:20] <Cork> vPoint: anyway, you need to use deferred or callback, and then wait for all the load calls to finish before you make tyhe $.get call
[07:47:34] <Cork> tyhe==the
[07:48:20] <vPoint> Cork: am i not waiting for the calls to finish ?
[07:48:44] <j3lte> AJAX = aSync
[07:49:09] <Krambiorix> <hen opening a dialog, i see the dialog first at the bottom of the window and after a small second on top of my window... How can i make it to be instantly at the top?
[07:49:23] <Cork> vPoint: no your firing of 4 loads and one get call
[07:49:32] <Cork> and then they complete when they complete
[07:49:37] <Siecje> how can I save a draggable jqueryui order? http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[07:50:12] <Cork> vPoint: one thing you know for sure; and that is that neater of the load calls will have finished before your get call starts
[07:50:33] <Cork> vPoint: as the callbacks that does the update for .load can't fire before your code has ended
[07:50:42] <j3lte> Krambiorix you have an example? I have worked with those dialogs. Usually this is more of a CSS thing (transition times)
[07:50:56] <vPoint> Cork: hmm okay .. can you suggest changes to the code?
[07:52:35] <Cork> vPoint: i would prob replace the .load calls with .get('url', data, function(data) { $('target').html(data); })
[07:53:17] <Cork> vPoint: then collect the value the $.get calls return and use [list of get deferred values].then(function() { $.get() });
[07:53:27] <Cork> that should make your code work
[07:53:45] <j3lte> Siecje: yes you can. http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-change
[07:54:58] <Siecje> j3lte: how do I get the order though? When I view the page source the items are in the same spot
[07:55:43] <Eviltwin> Cork: Don't forget to $.when them together
[07:55:52] <Cork> opps correct
[07:55:56] <Cork> vPoint: ≈
[07:55:58] <Cork> *^
[07:56:01] <j3lte> Siecje: Do you have an example?
[07:56:14] <Eviltwin> $.when.apply($, [ list of deferreds ]).then(...)
[07:56:17] <Siecje> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/ I just have the example
[07:56:18] <j3lte> And how do you view the page source?
[07:56:29] <Siecje> ctrl+u in chrome
[07:57:05] <Siecje> I guess I need to have a number input and then update that on drag and drop?
[07:57:05] <Cork> or $.when($.get(),\n $.get(),\n...).then()
[07:57:06] <reloadz> hi again my internet friends! ^^
[07:57:34] <vPoint> hmm ...
[07:58:01] <reloadz> I got stupid problam! n = 5; p = 1; var f = n + p; f returns 51
[07:58:05] <j3lte> Siecje: try to inspect the element, you will see the order change in the inspector on draging the elements
[07:58:24] <Eviltwin> reloadz: No, 5 + 1 returns 6
[07:58:25] <Krambiorix> j3lte, yeah i see that the style of the ui-dialog has a position:absolute . So i think the style load is taking a second
[07:58:36] <reloadz> not to me :D
[07:58:41] <Eviltwin> "5" + 1, 5 + "1", or "5" + "1" return "51"
[07:58:45] <Eviltwin> So be specific
[07:59:05] <Eviltwin> There's a difference between 1 and "1"
[07:59:05] <reloadz> whate...
[07:59:25] <j3lte> Eviltwin not in my books ;)
[07:59:38] <j3lte> lol just kiddin
[07:59:46] <Siecje> j3lte: yes I see them moving now, but how do I save the order?
[08:00:48] <vPoint> i am quiet a begineer at jQuery .. $.get("getter.php?choice=" + escape($("#sides").val()) + "&fetch=quantity").then(function(response){ $("#quantity").????(response); })
[08:01:47] <vPoint> Cork: first i need to replace the LOADS with the GET  ... LOADS are dropdown menus, how i'll populate them?
[08:02:26] <j3lte> Siecje, saving the order to, say a database? All the items should have an ID, so you could serialize() it. I suggest you have a look at this old tutorial http://www.xmech.net/programming/jquery-ui-sortable-tutorial/
[08:04:04] <Brutick> Would anyone be willing to explain what seialize()-ing does? I keep seeing the term, but I'm not sure what its purpose is.

[08:26:57] <gordian> PM me if you're freelancing and up for a bug fixing gig on iPhone/iOS
[08:39:49] <DannyZB> how , in jquery , do I use variables passed into ajax in the success:function () call?
[08:40:23] <DannyZB> ie , I have a loop that retrieves a list of URL's , and I need each mapped to the index in an array equivalent to the loop index
[08:40:48] <DannyZB> the values inside the ajax callback are obviously in a different order , as the variable changes before I get the result ><
[08:41:15] <Brutick> Can you not use the responsetext from the ajax request to your benefit?
[08:41:36] <gordian> I'm developing a site modeled after http://alwayscreative.net and running into one issue on iPhone. If you go to that site on an iPhone and click any of the PORTFOLIO items you can see that a FlexSlider slides in. Then click either of the arrows at the top to go to the next/previous portfolio item. The smooth scrolling is done via iScroll (http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and when the next or previous item is taller or shorter th
[08:41:37] <DannyZB> not really
[08:41:38] <gordian> the height of the iScroll element changes accordingly. My dev site is at http://goo.gl/UCtv0 and if you visit it on iPhone and click the OUR WORK section you will see similar functionality. However, when navigating within the FlexSlider using the previous/next nav, the iScroll object maintains its height even though it refreshes. There are no console errors at all and everything work flawlessly on desktop browsers. If anyone
[08:41:38] <gordian> help then please let me know. If I can answer questions or if this is unclear then let me know. Thanks!
[08:41:59] <DannyZB> brutick I thought of that , but it's extremely inelegant with my CDN
[08:42:07] <DannyZB> Is there a cleaner way ?
[08:42:36] <Brutick> DannyZB: Ah alright, I'm no expert on Ajax, so I'm not sure what else you could try. I'm sure someone else can help.
[08:42:54] <DannyZB> yea this problem is baffling to me .. no clue what to do
[08:45:03] <j3lte> DannyZB, can you give an example? I'd like to see it, I might be able to help
[08:45:22] <DannyZB> it's kind of fragmented right now
[08:45:27] <DannyZB> one sec I'll write a simple example
[08:45:30] <j3lte> Ok
[08:45:42] <j3lte> JSFiddle / JSbin
[08:46:03] <DannyZB> nope .. can't give you an interactive example .. can't really write my server URL
[08:46:17] <DannyZB> but no worries it's not complicated
[08:47:18] <theForce> hi
[08:49:12] <DannyZB> j3lte: http://pastebin.ca/2414855
[08:49:28] <DannyZB> notice how I'm using "i" in the success callback
[08:49:37] <DannyZB> but it may already be different by the time the server responds
[08:49:44] <DannyZB> how do I pass it in there properly ?
[08:49:58] <toddWork__> i want to get an element with an attribute of attr('id') which is equal to 6.
[08:50:35] <toddWork__> do i need to loop all of the similar members of a class or can i pick it out by its id attritbute?
[08:50:39] <theForce> i overwrite bootstrap's collapse method. i need to determine whether it was called via mouse click or not (e.g. called via js). is that possible? my code looks like this http://jsfiddle.net/6yB93/
[08:50:51] <Brutick> toddWork__: $('input[id=6]')
[08:51:48] <Brutick> toddWork__: the annoying part is that you must target the type of tag...
[08:53:35] <toddWork__> Brutick: i think i need something like $('attr[foo=6]'); sorry, using the id was probably confusing.
[08:53:58] <toddWork__> i'm trying to cherry pick <div foo="6"></div>       <-----
[08:54:20] <Brutick> toddWork__: Then yes that's exactly how you do it. You usually target the attribute using the square brackets, like you would in CSS.
[08:54:30] <toddWork__> thanks Brutick
[08:54:34] <j3lte> DannyZB: that's a hard question for me... hmmm. Is the array a fixed length?
[08:54:43] <DannyZB> no
[08:55:03] <DannyZB> haha I've been doing js for years .. this is hands down the first time I had absolutely no clue what I'm doing
[08:55:29] <DannyZB> I think I may be forced to bounce the parameters off the server
[08:56:01] <shoky> DannyZB: you need a local function scope in your loop
[08:56:15] <j3lte> I think you might be right
[08:56:39] <DannyZB> shoky how does that preserve the values over loop iterations ?
[08:57:01] <shoky> DannyZB: easiest way is to use $.each   e.g. $.each(new Array(50), function(i) {  $.ajax(...)  })
[08:57:22] <shoky> DannyZB: because each iteration would get its own local scope and the i would be retained for that scope
[08:57:33] <DannyZB> wow thats brilliant haha
[08:57:34] <DannyZB> may just work
[08:57:50] <shoky> DannyZB:  another way:  for(var i=0; i<50; i++){ (function(i) {  $.ajax(...)  })(i) }
[08:58:08] <DannyZB> yea thats kind of ugly
[08:58:11] <DannyZB> the each way is better
[08:58:19] <shoky> yerp
[08:58:27] <DannyZB> you've done this before
[08:58:28] <DannyZB> ?
[08:58:37] <DannyZB> I'll try now but not so sure it'd work haha
[08:58:41] <j3lte> I keep on learning more and more, every day I'm here :p. Love shoky's proposal
[08:58:56] <shoky> DannyZB: yeah, this is a common issue in JS
[08:59:04] <shoky> with async callbacks
[08:59:16] <DannyZB> yea you have no idea how many times I beat my head against the wall over this one
[09:00:04] <slide> I need to create a div overlay ontop of an iframe (to stop all input to it) however I'm using CSS transitions to change its size. Is there any event that I can bind to when the position/size of the iframe changes?
[09:10:56] <abstrusenick> when doing single page app, does template engine matter so much?
[09:12:04] <BillCriswell> abstrusenick: A "page" is a weird way to guage the weight of a web app.
[09:14:11] <BillCriswell> abstrusenick: However, the template engine you use probably won't make a huge difference.
[09:14:45] <abstrusenick> i did a profiling with chrome dev tool
[09:14:59] <abstrusenick> and my render function takes like > 2000ms
[09:17:48] <BillCriswell> abstrusenick: Is there anything being done in render besides compiling the templates? What if you do like: console.time('render'); whatever.template(tpl, {}); console.timeEnd('render')

[09:33:52] <shoky> hey amh345.  hint: 1st line
[09:34:23] <shoky> oh that's not all though
[09:34:47] <shoky> .closest only goes to parents/ancestors, not to siblings.
[09:35:23] <shoky> you'd want .prev() or .prevAll('.test').first()
[09:36:32] <amh345> hey shoky.
[09:38:03] <alexr2> It looks like jQuery isn't setting its default contentType with an ajax request (at least not according to the headers).  Anyone have any insight on this?
[09:38:28] <shoky> alexr2: what do you mean?
[09:38:55] <shoky> and, show your ajax code
[09:39:12] <alexr2> shoky: according to the docs, it should be sending contentType¬†(default:¬†'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8') by default.  If I look at the headers being sent with the ajax request, it's not sending a contentType at all
[09:39:20] <amh345> i just noticed $(this). that was in there from last night when i was trying to get something else functioning. heh.   i will check your suggestion
[09:41:16] <shoky> alexr2: are you sending data?
[09:41:30] <alexr2> No
[09:41:41] <alexr2> Data is required for that to be sent?
[09:41:52] <shoky> alexr2: yes.. POST data
[09:42:00] <shoky> otherwise what would you need that header for
[09:42:41] <alexr2> To make sure the user is logged in when doing ajax requests, I send the response from the server based on what kind of request is being made
[09:43:17] <alexr2> Hmm, wonder if expressjs has something to check for xhr request rather than checking for json type
[09:43:36] <alexr2> ahh it does, that makes things easier, thanks shoky

[09:49:54] <ak5> does jquery have something like a dynamic iframe helper?
[09:50:07] <ak5> How would one implement something like this?
[09:50:17] <Intensity> eww
[09:50:19] <Intensity> iframe
[09:50:45] <Brutick> CrysAk: Does this help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042312/jquery-find-file-extension-from-string
[09:50:50] <ak5> Intensity: well, I want to render other webpages in mine via ajax, they keep their scripts/stylesheets - don't know how to name that
[09:52:53] <alexr2> 1 more quick question, is there any way to set the statusText that you get on an unknown error code?  For example, a 500 error code would throw an error "Internal Server Error" automatically.  I'm sending a 441 error code response with something like "Limit reached" as the message.  Any way for that to be the error that's thrown by jQuery?
[09:53:46] <CrysAk> Brutick that's what i;m trying at the moment but wanted to make sure it;s safe to use and can;t be abused
[09:54:01] <ak5> alexr2: you can parse the error yourself and toss the original
[09:54:31] <ak5> alexr2: throw error and handle it youyrself, get your server to send the right headers, done
[09:54:54] <ak5> two options ^_^
[09:54:59] <alexr2> Well the server sends 441 without an issue.  But the statusText I get is "unknown"
[09:55:01] <Brutick> CrysAk: I figure the only way to be super safe is to have a complex RegEx evaluating whether or not the extension is valid
[09:55:15] <ak5> alexr2: get it from the header directly
[09:55:58] <CrysAk> Brutick, ok thanks for the input :) i'm using the var ext = file.split('.').pop(); option, are there any major flaws in this (not too great qwith jquery...)
[09:56:13] <alexr2> ak5, I can get the message from the data that's sent back, that's not the problem.  I'm talking about the console.log error that's thrown... ie: POST http://localhost:8000/abc 441 (unknown)
[09:56:51] <ak5> alexr2: I don't know what that (unknown) is
[09:57:01] <ak5> what are you console logging?
[09:57:22] <alexr2> ak5, it's the error thrown by jquery when you get a non 200 response for an ajax request
[09:57:38] <Brutick> CrysAk: The first thing I'd notice is that how do you handle extraneous periods in the file name? For example, could one still upload a file named test.txt.pdf?
[09:57:44] <alexr2> if the server responded with a 500, it would be POST http://localhost:8000/abc 500 (Internal Server Error)
[09:57:52] <Brutick> CrysAk: What about text..pdf?
[09:58:26] <Brutick> CrysAk: I can't weigh in on any other major flaws, but it completely depends on how you handle the string splitting to test the extension.
[09:59:12] <ak5> alexr2: errorThrown <- are you using this?
[09:59:14] <Intensity> jus use a regex
[09:59:57] <Intensity> \.[\w]{3,4}$
[09:59:59] <alexr2> ak5, no
[10:00:04] <ak5> alexr2: check it out
[10:00:11] <ak5> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:02:15] <alexr2> ak5, are you talking about the third argument for the error function?
[10:02:36] <ak5> yeah
[10:02:46] <alexr2> That's already set to "unknown"
[10:02:48] <ak5> if you want to know about the error, handle the error
[10:03:17] <alexr2> I am handling the error, but jQuery (I believe, it might just be the browser) logs out an error on its own because the response wasn't a 200
[10:04:03] <alexr2> like if i just do a random ajax request to a url that doesn't exist, I'll get an error back that's a 404, and it'll be logged to the console as 404 (Not Found)
[10:04:07] <ak5> alexr2: why are you not using error then?
[10:04:35] <alexr2> I am using error, I don't think I conveyed my request across correctly
[10:04:50] <alexr2> rather my question
[10:05:31] <ak5> alexr2: whats your backend? Is the response formed properly?
[10:05:41] <CrysAk> Brutick thanks, it has better checks server side via php, this one is jsut used to fend off idiots uploading silly files :)
[10:06:18] <kamo> Does anyone know if the IE bug of elem.setAttribute is fixed?
[10:06:41] <alexr2> nodejs, yes, response headers are sending my error code correctly.  I'm not sure if I can even set a statusText, I haven't looked into it yet.
[10:08:22] <lhunath> is there an easy way to find an element's position in document coordinates?
[10:08:30] <Brutick> CrysAk: The other thing I can think of is if you could possibly check the MIME type of the file? That way people can't upload *.pdf that aren't acutally *.pdf (i.e. *.zip renamed to *.pdf)
[10:08:45] <lhunath> or window
[10:09:13] <alexr2> I'll take a look into it ak5, thanks for the help
[10:09:19] <CrysAk> Brutick ahh thanks, yea i;m doing that via php in the next page, people that do that don;t deserve a nice jquery msg :P
[10:09:51] <Brutick> CrysAk: Haha, agreed. They sure don't!

[10:33:16] <Krambiorix> hi, when having this: http://jsfiddle.net/EtNxW/2/  -> when i click action 2 i want it to disappear from the list. When after that i click action 1 , i want action 2 to be in the dropdown again ...
[10:35:21] <nousit> hello!
[10:37:35] <alexr2> ak5, yes that's what I'm using.  Same issue as the response to the first answer.  It sets the body of the response, but the statusText remains unchanged
[10:37:54] <ak5> alexr2: yeah thought so, jquery is solid for this
[10:38:10] <blib> is there a JQuery shortcut to make a function call become async?
[10:38:48] <alexr2> okay, it was just a convenience type of thing, not actually necessary
[10:38:50] <alexr2> thanks for the help
[10:39:59] <ak5> np
[10:44:49] <nousit> hey I'm pretty new to jquery and js in particular.  I wrote some code but its not working, can some one help me out?
[10:45:35] <regedit> nousit: proceed to ask your question, not asking to ask. use jsfiddle.net to demonstrate your case
[10:58:48] <blib> does anyone have any pointers to a good menu in CSS/jquery that is good for mobile devices?
[11:12:25] <spacebarbarian> what is up with chrome never clearing cache on control+f5
[11:12:31] <spacebarbarian> so annoying
[11:12:59] <blindMoe> ctrl+shift+R
[11:13:19] <vinky> -^
[11:13:39] <jedimind> PORN MODE
[11:13:54] <blindMoe> ctrl+shift+N  ;)
[11:13:55] <spacebarbarian> oo i didnt think of that ^
[11:14:22] <spacebarbarian> ctrl shift r doesnt help, still loading from cache with that
[11:14:35] <blindMoe> really?  Works for me every time
[11:14:40] <vinky> how do you know?
[11:14:43] <spacebarbarian> blib, try https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/ if you want a fancy one
[11:14:56] <spacebarbarian> vinky, network tab in debugger showing (from cache)
[11:15:11] <vinky> hm, always worked for me
[11:16:55] <plambwk>  hi guys, can someone tell me why the 'active' classes are not dissappearing on mouseover?
[11:17:00] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/HvT3U/1/
[11:18:02] <plambwk> wait
[11:18:11] <plambwk> is it because im not including the latest jquery
[11:18:56] <spacebarbarian> i guess i must use porn mode for developer mode now that seems to work lol
[11:19:43] <BillCriswell> plambwk: .one has been around for a while.
[11:21:15] <plambwk> including 1.10.1 seemed to work in fiddle
[11:21:26] <BillCriswell> plambwk: The HTML here is also looks a little.. errory
[11:21:36] <plambwk> yeah, im am amatuer
[11:22:43] <plambwk> an*
[11:23:17] <plambwk> including 1.10.1 worked in fiddle, but doesnt in my main files :(
[11:23:39] <BillCriswell> plambwk: I can't even see the .active elements in console.
[11:23:52] <BillCriswell> $('.active') returns null
[11:24:34] <BillCriswell> plambwk: Think you just need to clean up the HTML.
[11:29:03] <plambwk> hmm
[11:29:04] <plambwk> okay
[11:30:31] <vinky> BillCriswell, I suspect thats do to jsfiddle using an iframe
[11:30:38] <vinky> s/do/due/
[11:30:39] <BillCriswell> plambwk: http://jsbin.com/ifovod/1/edit here's a dumb simple example, you're taking the right approach.
[11:31:01] <BillCriswell> vinky: .... dammit.
[11:31:13] <Intensity> lol\
[11:31:28] <vinky> yeah...
[11:31:37] <Intensity> kan sum1 splain to me?
[11:32:58] <plambwk> hmm BillCriswell im having trouble seeing how this is different from my code
[11:33:33] <plambwk> well
[11:33:44] <zizzl> Hey guys i have a ("#inputid").mask("(999) 999-9999"); which typically works but on this current project it does produce the (___) ____ - ____ like it should but I can type over it, it just types next to it or inbetween characters
[11:33:45] <plambwk> accept that you dont have '.active' in the line of jquery
[11:33:46] <zizzl> getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined "  on jquery.maskedinput.js
[11:33:50] <plambwk> except*
[11:34:08] <vinky> plambwk, on your site, run the selector in the console to see if you get what you want
[11:35:07] <BillCriswell> I think there's something screwy with the HTML still haha.
[11:35:27] <BillCriswell> I could be wrong, probably.
[11:35:55] <plambwk> i could probably make my test case a lot simpler
[11:35:56] <plambwk> hang on
[11:36:06] <BillCriswell> plambwk: That's what I did haha
[11:36:33] <boytoy> Is there a better way to do this Packery "click-to-see-photos-only" thing - http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NEK4n/ - than to surgically alter the HTML every time you turn it on and off?
[11:38:23] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/HvT3U/4/
[11:38:25] <plambwk> there
[11:38:28] <plambwk> removed a ton of CSS
[11:38:57] <plambwk> all the .active stuff is at the bottom
[11:39:04] <plambwk> granted, this fiddle is working the way i want it too...
[11:39:10] <plambwk> so that doesn't really expose the issue
[11:39:13] <BillCriswell> plambwk: This works.
[11:39:24] <plambwk> yeah, lol
[11:39:37] <plambwk> yet magically doesn't in my main files
[11:39:42] <plambwk> guess ill keep tinkering
[11:39:47] <BillCriswell> Do you get an error?
[11:40:32] <plambwk> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[11:40:33] <plambwk> yup
[11:40:56] <rns> anyone know why this isn't rendering my chart? http://jsfiddle.net/6vNkW/
[11:41:43] <vinky> plambwk, where do you get it?
[11:41:59] <plambwk> oh wow, its in some random other JS file
[11:42:07] <plambwk> jquery.superfish.js:73
[11:42:12] <plambwk> jquery**
[11:42:27] <plambwk> this is why redesigning a site within an old site template sucks.
[11:42:44] <zizzl> Anyone???
[11:42:54] <Coin-coin> Hi
[11:43:28] <Brutick> zizzl, can you reproduce it on jsfiddle?
[11:43:30] <vinky> rns you got a syntax error in there, line 5
[11:44:05] <vinky> plambwk, yeah, it probably doesnt work with newer jquery
[11:44:45] <plambwk> but still i feel like that shouldnt impact what im trying to do
[11:45:05] <rns> vinky, ah, that appears to be right....but any idea why it doesn't work here?  It shows an uncaught exception on line 121?  http://www.propertymetrics.com/test-highcharts/
[11:45:32] <vinky> rns, I get a 403
[11:46:16] <Brutick> plambwk, are you using IE for testing?
[11:47:01] <rns> vinky, you can't access that url?
[11:47:10] <vinky> correct
[11:47:31] <Brutick> rns, I can... thru my work firewall...
[11:47:57] <rns> Brutick, any idea what's causing the uncaught exception error on line 121?
[11:48:10] <plambwk> Brutick: nope, chrome
[11:48:32] <Brutick> plambwk: Try this anyways. Change .one() to .on()
[11:48:58] <Brutick> rns: I'm not seeing any errors on my screen, but I can dig into the source
[11:49:24] <rns> Brutick, there should be a second chart on that page....chrome dev tools console shows error on line 121
[11:49:50] <Brutick> rns, Ah okay, sorry I didnt read the background of the problem, just sort of chimed in.
[11:50:29] <plambwk> Brutick or vinky: mind if I pm ?
[11:50:53] <Brutick> plambwk: I don't mind, but I'm pretty nooby when it comes to this.
[11:59:06] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a better jquery/javascript debugger than firebug? It doesn't ever really tell you whats wrong
[11:59:11] <rns> Brutick, any ideas?
[11:59:28] <Brutick> rns: Sorry, no clue... it looks correct to me :(
[11:59:28] <Intensity> coz
[11:59:43] <blindMoe> zizzl: I use chrome developer tools... not sure what you mean by "whats wrong" though since most debuggers are going to show you the same info
[11:59:55] <Intensity> thats one wack high chart
[12:00:00] <Intensity> use D3
[12:00:19] <Intensity> zizzl: no thats a problem w javascript
[12:00:23] <Intensity> no firebug
[12:00:32] <vinky> zizzl, I have come to the conclusion that chrome devtools are far better than firebug
[12:00:42] <vinky> IMHO
[12:00:56] <moijk> you have to pry firebug out of my cold dead hands.
[12:01:05] <blindMoe> you can keep it
[12:01:06] <Intensity> being humble is geeeeeey
[12:01:07] <blindMoe> ;)
[12:01:57] <Intensity> o.o
[12:01:58] <vinky> firebug froze my browser yesterday :-(
[12:02:03] <Intensity> lies
[12:02:08] <Intensity> stop lying :O
[12:02:13] <Intensity> lier
[12:02:23] <vinky> okay, it made it unusable
[12:02:33] <Intensity> no u jus kudnt use it
[12:03:11] <blib> spacebarbarian: thanks
[12:03:26] <blib> spacebarbarian: have you used it yet?
[12:04:35] <demifuror> hi guys. does anyone know of a way i can implement find next/replace current/replace all functionality with jquery on a textarea
[12:05:30] <spacebarbarian> blib, yeah i did a basic site navigation menu with it
[12:06:57] <rns> anyone know what's causing this uncaught exception on line 121?  http://www.propertymetrics.com/test-highcharts/
[12:09:18] <vinky> rns, whats the exception and whats on line 121
[12:10:18] <catcher> I'm using getJSON to retrieve ajax data from a controller of my own.  The results seem to be cached no matter what I do - clearing cache, destroying cookies, renaming the URL I'm requesting, etc.
[12:10:31] <Intensity> vinky: dont help him w comercial software lol
[12:10:39] <Intensity> fah
[12:11:19] <Intensity> catcher: append a t=timestamp
[12:11:25] <Intensity> or t=rand()
[12:11:34] <Intensity> to the data url
[12:11:48] <m4rx> I'm having trouble with ajax navigation on jquery mobile
[12:11:57] <catcher> Intensity, I'm currently requesting a ?var=Math.random()
[12:14:10] <catcher> IE and Safari seem to get it right, but chrome & FF are hanging on for dear life
[12:15:12] <Intensity> Even if I'm not typing.  I'm here. Reading. Judging.
[12:15:13] <Intensity> lol
[12:15:16] <Intensity> can i say loser
[12:16:18] <jgornick> Hey guy, is there a tolerance method exposed in jQueryUI that allows me to determine when an element is "intersecting" ?
[12:16:19] <rns> vinky, it says it's an uncaught typeerror: undefined is not a function ...
[12:17:12] <Intensity> rns: good
[12:17:17] <Intensity> now pay us
[12:17:23] <Intensity> lool
[12:17:23] <shoky> jgornick: yes, for droppable and sortable
[12:17:34] <jgornick> shoky: Where do I access the method?
[12:17:49] <rns> Intensity, you have my gratitude
[12:17:58] <shoky> jgornick: as per the API docs
[12:18:16] <shoky> it's an "option" not a method
[12:18:49] <jgornick> shoky, just to sure, i'm not looking for the tolerance "option", but a method that I can use to determine the tolerance of two entities.
[12:18:50] <shoky> jgornick: and if you meant to ask if it lets you have full control over it, then nope
[12:19:10] <shoky> oh
[12:19:20] <shoky> there might be
[12:20:12] <jgornick> shoky: Looking like: $.ui.intersect
[12:20:40] <shoky> yeah just found that too
[12:20:59] <rmurphey> you may also find position useful
[12:21:07] <rmurphey> http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[12:21:18] <rmurphey> depending on what you're doing
[12:22:11] <jgornick> rmurphey: Trying to use draggable/droppable to build a nested sortable control.
[12:22:23] <jgornick> Also, I know there's a lot out there, but they don't do what I need, of course.
[12:23:09] <catcher> Ah, interesting issue. My json_encoded array was indexed by object IDs.  Looks like IE/Safari get the data in sequential order, but Chrome/FF get the data in numeric key order.
[12:23:18] <ali_> Hi all, can anyone help me create a deferred object? I'm trying to go through an array of $.getJSON calls "my server's name" and display that list of server names.
[12:23:43] <jgornick> rmurphey and shoky, thanks for the help.
[12:23:55] <shoky> ali_: what's the issue?
[12:23:58] <ali_> I have been reading the documentation for .while and cannot figure out how to create a deferred object out of this
[12:24:11] <shoky> .while?
[12:24:44] <ali_> sorry, I mean .when
[12:24:59] <shoky> $.when  returns a new promise for you
[12:25:04] <ali_> So I have an array of getJSON calls
[12:25:18] <ali_> and I want to wait until they all make their call before I return an array of names from the JSON calls
[12:25:30] <ali_> does that make sense?
[12:25:31] <shoky> $.when.apply($, arrayOfDeferreds).then( ... )
[12:25:38] <Sirisian|Work> So I have a div with a set of divs inside and if you click on one it should return the height of all the divs added up except the bottom one and the one the person clicked on. $("#columns").parent().children().not(this).not(#bottom).height() do I have to do .each and sum the heights or is there a quick aggregate method?
[12:25:56] <shoky> ali_: it makes sense except for the "return" part
[12:26:22] <ali_> I'm returning the array to my ember.js app where it'll show a list, that part isn't really important
[12:26:51] <Goopyo> shoky: does this not update the dom? $('.search-active').removeClass('search-active');
[12:26:53] <ali_> shoky_: if you don't mind, could you provide me an example of how to create a deferred object out of a JSON call? I've been trying to find material online and am not successful
[12:27:04] <Goopyo> it works fine in my debugger but the dom isn't updating
[12:28:07] <yedi> does anyone know of any js library / widgets for displaying facets in a sidebar?
[12:28:26] <shoky> ali_:  var requests = [$.getJSON(...),  $.getJSON(...)];  var allRequestsPromise = $.when.apply($, requests);  allRequestsPromise.then(function(data1, data2) { ... })
[12:28:50] <Goopyo> yedi: what do you mean like scrollspy?
[12:29:06] <Goopyo> http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#scrollspy
[12:29:09] <shoky> Goopyo: it does
[12:29:27] <Goopyo> shoky: hmm might be my css then.
[12:30:19] <yedi> Goopyo: nah -- you know how webstores have a sidebar with a bunch of categories and you can select certain categories to narrow your search results / product listings
[12:30:27] <yedi> i'm looking for a wideget that handles that UI
[12:30:50] <ali_> shoky: thanks, I'm going to go try this. Thanks for your help
[12:34:42] <ali_> shoky: In your example, (on the third line, where it says data1, data2)..... I don't have a fixed number of arguments, it could change based on my array of getJSON requests(it pulls from an external API, depends on how many servers are offline). What do you recommend I use?
[12:35:23] <shoky> ?g mdn arguments @ ali_
[12:35:25] <b-ot> ali_: Argument, Why Men Don't Wear Hijab? - Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan ... ‚Üí http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfLM44RKS4E

[12:35:36] <shoky> the latter :P
[12:36:20] <Intensity> dafuq
[12:36:30] <Intensity> hijab
[12:36:34] <shoky> at least i think that's the best way to deal with it, maybe there's some nicer way
[12:38:01] <blib> is there a widget that allows me to rank a bunch of elements?
[12:40:35] <BillCriswell> blib: data-rank="0" and you can increment that number based on criteria.
[12:41:03] <Croves> I created a form using jquery and .append(), but when I try to submit this form, the AJAX that I have in my code does not work with this form
[12:41:04] <Croves> Why?
[12:42:38] <BillCriswell> Croves: Apply the event listener after the form is created.
[12:42:42] <Intensity> $(form).serialize();
[12:42:49] <Intensity> data =
[12:43:04] <Intensity> .ajax(data, func...
[12:44:00] <Croves> BillCriswell I did it
[12:44:04] <blib> BillCriswell: I need something which the user can interact with? Drag a name down the rank. Pull one to top , etc
[12:44:23] <BillCriswell> blib: jquery ui sortables sounds like a good tool for the job
[12:46:30] <blib> BillCriswell: Thanks. How do I read the output order selected by the user?
[12:47:03] <BillCriswell> blib: You have the read the manual.
[12:47:23] <Intensity> gah
[12:47:51] <Intensity> blib: dis ur first rodeo?
[12:48:07] <Intensity> jeesh
[12:49:30] <yellowfish> is there a way to add a mouse event to multiple jquery selectors?
[12:49:44] <defaultro> use class I think
[12:50:05] <Intensity> $('.lol, .wtf').click()
[12:51:32] <yellowfish> how do i access individual properties then?
[12:52:02] <yellowfish> say like $('.lol, .wtf').click(function(             ))
[12:52:15] <yellowfish> how do I access each element in the function?
[12:52:33] <Intensity> see if event is aray?
[12:52:52] <Intensity> wait
[12:52:57] <Intensity> u cant click both at once lol
[12:53:10] <Intensity> so itl be one event
[12:53:18] <Intensity> $(this)
[12:53:42] <Intensity> but usually i do function(e) { $(e)
[12:58:13] <Intensity> its important to realize that no matter how fast somehting happens that it still hapens one by one and in order
[12:59:11] <yellowfish> do i always have to place listeners
[12:59:15] <yellowfish> inside document.ready?
[13:00:39] <Intensity> i do unless its using another framework
[13:00:53] <Intensity> but i think there is also .delegate or .live
[13:04:59] <BillCriswell> StackOverflow is such a rat race.
[13:05:19] <Intensity> yellowfish: http://encosia.com/dont-let-jquerys-document-ready-slow-you-down/
[13:05:45] <Intensity> i have yet to need .live() so i looked it up
[13:05:55] <Intensity> fuk it
[13:05:59] <Intensity> i use backbone
[13:06:09] <Intensity> and its friken KILLER!!!!!!!!!
[13:06:51] <Intensity> backbone relies jquery and underscore too so u cant go wrong lol
[13:07:11] <Intensity> oh and require.js doesnt hurt either
[13:07:19] * jedimind hugs Intensity 
[13:07:30] <Intensity> poerv
[13:07:53] <Krambiorix> hi, i use ajax to retrieve some data, the data is very long, can jquery cache some data?
[13:08:35] <lmnao24> http://pastie.org/8104498 <-- How come "data_loop" is undefined? how do i pass it from the top to the fadeOut function
[13:09:13] <lmnao24> http://pastie.org/8104502 (comments)
[13:09:46] <BillCriswell> lmnao24: You don't need to put it in the callback for fadeOut.
[13:09:52] <BillCriswell> fadeToggle*
[13:10:00] <BillCriswell> data_loop will be available.
[13:10:12] <lmnao24> I tried.. undefined for some reason
[13:10:16] <lmnao24> that's why i placed it there
[13:10:22] <Intensity> that is weird
[13:10:25] <lmnao24> can i pm you the working url?
[13:10:38] <BillCriswell> lmnao24: can't right now, but $('#team-overlay').fadeToggle('fast', function(data_loop) should probably be $('#team-overlay').fadeToggle('fast', function()
[13:11:13] <Intensity> oh
[13:11:14] <Intensity> hahaha
[13:11:15] <Intensity> yeah
[13:11:16] <Intensity> lol
[13:11:45] <lmnao24> you're right.. works thanks!
[13:11:48] <BillCriswell> Welcome!

[13:12:13] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[13:12:51] <arschmitz> ignore me all my scroll was not working and that was a response to something wuite old
[13:13:02] <Intensity> .on() replaces .live()
[13:13:32] <Intensity> .on() looks so gey to me

[13:13:40] <Xal_> Has anyone ever had a conflict with jquery and the ScriptManager from ASP.NET?
[13:13:52] <Intensity> okay fuk .net

[13:15:04] <BillCriswell> Intensity: Are you ok?
[13:15:06] <Krambiorix> i want to use the data() function to cache some data... How can i control that when the data on the server changes, the data in cache will be changed too?
[13:15:24] <Sirisian|Work> Including jquery mobile with jquery ui for swipe events won't break anything right?
[13:15:28] <Xal_> Bill, I'm not sure, but I think he has a problem with .NET
[13:15:58] <Rizwan> Can anyone help me?
[13:16:17] <Intensity> i have yet to see .net devs make a cool app
[13:16:28] <Intensity> it all stinks too much of windows
[13:16:32] <BillCriswell> Rizwan: Just ask.
[13:16:41] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, any idea?
[13:16:42] <BillCriswell> If someone can help they more than likely will.
[13:16:43] <Intensity> all other devs in year 2013
[13:16:52] <dogarrhea> Intensity: blame java

[13:17:13] <Intensity> lol
[13:17:45] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I can only imagine refreshing the data periodically using a timeout with ajax.
[13:18:04] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, now that's not a silly idea :D
[13:18:14] <Intensity> yep
[13:18:40] <Intensity> prety much how u do it
[13:19:03] <BillCriswell> Rizwan: You just want something to stick on the screen? You might be able to get away with just .stick-element { position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; }
[13:19:09] <Krambiorix> Intensity, are you talking about .NET or about data cache?
[13:19:16] <Intensity> .net
[13:19:20] <Krambiorix> ow
[13:19:56] <Rizwan> BillCriswell < Thanks, let me try this
[13:20:24] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, i think it would be a better idea to cache the ajax response
[13:20:34] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, like in cache: true,
[13:21:01] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: If you're goal is to keep the data up to data though I'm not sure caching is the best bet? I might be misunderstanding something.
[13:21:50] <gordian> I'm developing a site modeled after http://alwayscreative.net and running into one issue on iPhone. If you go to that site on an iPhone and click any of the PORTFOLIO items you can see that a FlexSlider slides in. Then click either of the arrows at the top to go to the next/previous portfolio item. The smooth scrolling is done via iScroll (http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and when the next or previous item is taller or shorter th
[13:21:50] <gordian> the height of the iScroll element changes accordingly. My dev site is at http://goo.gl/UCtv0 and if you visit it on iPhone and click the OUR WORK section you will see similar functionality. However, when navigating within the FlexSlider using the previous/next nav, the iScroll object maintains its height even though it refreshes. There are no console errors at all and everything work flawlessly on desktop browsers. If anyone
[13:21:51] <gordian> help then please let me know. If I can answer questions or if this is unclear then let me know. Thanks!
[13:21:55] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, it can have a delay... I mean , it may take 5 mins to get the updated data
[13:23:29] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Ooo...
[13:25:15] <j3lte> gordian: this question you already asked this afternoon, like 6 hours ago. Still nothing?
[13:25:35] <gordian> j3lte: unfortunately still nothing
[13:25:35] <amph1bius> gordian: i don't think anyone wants to go and open that site on an iphone
[13:25:39] <amph1bius> it's just too much hassle
[13:25:52] <gordian> i've even asked on the freelance chan
[13:26:04] <gordian> amph1bius: i know, opening one website can be soooo tedious
[13:26:14] <amph1bius> on an iphone yes
[13:26:16] <j3lte> lol
[13:26:18] <amph1bius> because i have an android
[13:26:23] <j3lte> me too
[13:26:36] <gordian> the biggest problem is that i don't know where the problem is
[13:26:41] <gordian> it could be jQuery
[13:26:42] <gordian> or JS
[13:26:49] <gordian> or a stupid markup issue
[13:26:57] <gordian> but i have no console errors to go on
[13:27:03] <amph1bius> use jsconsole.com
[13:27:04] <gordian> and everything works perfectly on desktop browsers
[13:27:22] <j3lte> is it even possible to check such things on an iphone?
[13:27:30] <amph1bius> jsconsole rocks my socks
[13:27:42] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, what has OpenOffice to do with this?
[13:27:47] * j3lte has a solid hatred against Apple, so he no uses iphones
[13:27:51] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, no, what do you mean?
[13:28:00] <gordian> j3lte: mobile safari has an inspector
[13:28:03] <j3lte> but thats a different topic of conversation
[13:28:05] <j3lte> hmmm
[13:28:14] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Say what?
[13:28:15] <Krambiorix> j3lte, but i'm with ya on this
[13:28:33] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, nevermind.. .But what do you mean with Ooo ?
[13:29:10] <gordian> if opening a simple website is too much for you then i invite you to ignore my question
[13:29:15] <gordian> ‚Ä¶ or my nick
[13:29:49] <amph1bius> i'm not being an ass, i'm just trying to help you ask your question better.
[13:30:06] <jgornick> Hey guys, is it fair to say that when using the sortable in jQuery UI, draggable and droppable options resolve properly?
[13:30:08] <gordian> i'm not trying to either
[13:30:27] <gordian> i described the issue the best way i can
[13:30:30] <amph1bius> you should try making a one off example on jsfiddle demonstrating the problem
[13:30:34] <gordian> if you think it needs improving then i'm all ears
[13:30:35] <NoiseEee> gordian: offhand, the big 'iphone' / 'jquery' issue that i know of is that events don't bubble up to document.
[13:30:38] <amph1bius> so people can click and play around with it
[13:30:43] <NoiseEee> gordian: if you've got listeners there, change them to body.
[13:31:16] <amph1bius> jgornick: what do you mean resolve properly ?
[13:31:38] <gordian> amph1bius: you're asking me to re-create something that's already ready to be compared to a working version
[13:31:48] <jgornick> amph1bius: if i specificy the refreshPositions option in a sortable, it seems to behave like the droppable refreshPositions.
[13:31:55] <gordian> i understand jsfiddle provides more flexibility to mess around
[13:32:35] <gordian> unfortunately the issue relies on lots of scripts and css that jsfiddle may not be a suitable option
[13:33:10] <amph1bius> you would have better luck in getting people to help you if you did it that way
[13:34:17] <NoiseEee> gordian: so, do you have event listeners on 'document' ?
[13:35:11] <Leo> hi huys
[13:35:12] <gordian> NoiseEee: no, using $(window).load
[13:35:13] <Leo> how can i check if a string contains a numeric value (form validation)?
[13:35:30] <gordian> Leo: parseInt()
[13:36:54] <Leo> how would i use this heres my code http://pastie.org/8104585
[13:37:38] <Leo> i would like to see if fname contains number values if so do something if not do something else
[13:38:27] <gordian> Leo: parseInt()
[13:39:03] <Leo> yes but were sorry?
[13:40:25] <gordian> in your code
[13:41:11] <Leo> i no that, can you shoe me example in pastie?
[13:41:13] <Leo> sorry for hassle
[13:45:48] <Leo> ok then how would i write a condition for this
[13:51:21] <plambwk> Brutick/vinky/BillCriswell
[13:51:23] <plambwk> i figured it out
[13:51:27] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[13:51:32] <plambwk> the problem was having my javascript in the <head>
[13:51:38] <plambwk> so it was loading before the rest of the HTML
[13:51:53] <plambwk> $(document).ready(function () { $('.news .newswell').on('mouseover', function () { $('.newswell_large').removeClass('selected'); }); });
[13:51:59] <plambwk> added that little document.ready
[13:52:07] <BillCriswell> plambwk: Ahh.
[13:52:40] <plambwk> thank you tho
[13:53:35] <Intensity> sup gaize
[13:53:48] <Intensity> u gaize doin dat jquery
[13:54:12] <Sirisian|Work> I have a div and when I call $("foo").css("top", 0); it doesn't set it. It's still "auto" when I output it. Is that normal? I have a hidden div so I'm animating the scrolling up down by changing the top property. Can't see to edit it.
[13:54:36] <Intensity> document.ready is not little
[13:54:54] <Intensity> in fact it is the biggest
[13:54:56] <plambwk> lol
[13:55:24] <j3lte> funny thing... I didn't know you could mimic iPhone in Chrome Dev Tools... changing User-Agent
[13:55:37] <j3lte> gordian, I watched your main.js
[13:55:44] <boytoy> hehe yeah its sweet isnt it :-)
[13:56:10] <boytoy> the mimic thing
[13:56:12] <gordian> j3lte: cool, did you spot anything?
[13:56:24] <gordian> i'm trying to get this running in a jsfiddle but it's not happening
[13:56:42] <j3lte> there are no errors spotted
[13:56:54] <j3lte> myScroll == iScroller, right?
[13:57:10] <gordian> correct
[13:58:08] <gordian> ok, for those who want a jsfiddle...
[13:58:10] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/E45Gt/2/embedded/result/
[13:58:26] <gordian> now we'll see who's all talk ;-)
[13:58:41] <Leo> gordian: if parseInt for number values then whats the alphabetic characters
[14:00:07] <plambwk> where is the overrides menu in chrome dev tools
[14:01:07] <j3lte> gordian: you use on r207 (main.js) --> if (myScroll) { myScroll.refresh(); }. i think that one never fires. My guess
[14:01:29] <gordian> j3lte: it does fire
[14:01:34] <j3lte> plambwk: right bottom corner --> settings -> Overrides
[14:01:44] <gordian> you can add a console.log or alert to check
[14:01:50] <gordian> now that it's in jsfiddle
[14:01:53] <plambwk> oh, i found it
[14:01:55] <plambwk> thanks
[14:02:10] <j3lte> ok give me a sec, let's figure this out
[14:02:11] <gordian> Leo: sorry no idea
[14:02:59] <Leo> no problem
[14:03:51] <gordian> i even tried adding a timeout to the refresh method
[14:03:54] <gordian> no dice
[14:04:12] <gordian> but you can see that my structure and script mimics http://alwayscreative.net
[14:04:16] <gordian> and theirs works perfectly
[14:04:29] <gordian> so it must be some silly minute difference
[14:04:39] <gordian> possibly markup or css
[14:04:42] <gordian> but i really have no clue
[14:09:09] <Leo> im trying to scan my string, to see whether it contains numbers that parseInt works but now if alphabetic letters are in the string?
[14:13:33] <Intensity> stay strong Leo
[14:15:49] <Leo> haha
[14:18:33] <Leo> can someone please look at this code and explain to me where the test() comes from
[14:18:35] <Leo> http://pastie.org/8104695
[14:18:59] <j3lte> gordian... what if you place if (myScroll) {
[14:19:00] <j3lte>         myScroll.refresh();
[14:19:00] <j3lte>       }
[14:19:02] <BillCriswell> Leo: It's a method for regular expressions.
[14:19:21] <j3lte> after: $('#project-showcase').flexslider('next'); and $('#project-showcase').flexslider('prev');
[14:19:29] <monkeyz> Hi, I'm searching for some time now for a jquery script that replicates the windows "paint" app, I found some very nice tools but seemed too complex I only need lines,circles and squers does anyone know about such script?can you link me to something like that?
[14:19:30] <gordian> Leo: you can compare the length of your original string and the length of the parseInt result
[14:19:34] <BillCriswell> Leo: If it's not a letter or a number this thing says "no dice".
[14:19:40] <j3lte> so in the .project-next.click and .project-prev.click
[14:20:08] <j3lte> that's the only thing that would make it work in my Chrome devtools mimicking iPhone
[14:20:21] <j3lte> otherwise... I have not a single clue
[14:21:54] <Intensity> jquery is not paint lol
[14:22:00] <Leo> when i have mixed numbers a letters it doesnt work
[14:22:09] <Intensity> u need html5 canvas
[14:22:31] <Intensity> Leo: so combine the regex
[14:22:46] <Leo> how
[14:22:49] <Intensity> |
[14:22:50] <gordian> j3lte: doesn't work for me
[14:22:54] <Intensity> this|that
[14:23:10] <BillCriswell> Leo: You probably want /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test('string')
[14:23:11] <Intensity> or jus use \w+
[14:23:19] <j3lte> gordian than I'm at a loss, sorry buddy
[14:23:38] <Intensity> /[\w]+/ is wat he wants
[14:23:51] <gordian> this is exactly why i didnt want to post a jsfiddle
[14:24:07] <gordian> because you've probably not even looked at the site i'm mimicking
[14:24:12] <Leo> which one do i need lol
[14:24:16] <gordian> there's a perfect example of the implementation
[14:24:17] <Intensity> /[\w]+/ is wat he wants
[14:24:25] <gordian> and i'm mimicking that example
[14:24:27] <Leo> what does it do?
[14:24:34] <Intensity> checks for alfanumnerics
[14:24:35] <j3lte> gordian... I HAVE looked at the site. wtf
[14:24:50] <gordian> j3lte: which site?
[14:24:51] <j3lte> I'm trying to figure that out... don't be an ass
[14:25:01] <j3lte> alwayscreative
[14:25:07] <gordian> ok
[14:25:09] <j3lte> nvm, I'm done
[14:25:34] <gordian> i knew you couldn't solve it
[14:25:41] <gordian> thanks for trying and quitting though
[14:26:05] <j3lte> yeah sure. No wonder you haven't figured it out in 6 hours asking for help
[14:26:14] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[14:26:30] <BillCriswell> Fetting feisty in here.
[14:26:33] <BillCriswell> Getting*
[14:26:54] <gordian> sure, blame it on me
[14:27:02] <j3lte> Nahh I'm done. Gonna help other people.
[14:27:10] <j3lte> you're the one asking for help gordian
[14:27:16] <gordian> but if you knew how to solve it you wouldn't be acting like a prissy little girl
[14:27:28] <gordian> yeah i'm asking for help
[14:27:37] <gordian> i've even said i'd PAY for help
[14:27:57] <j3lte> maybe mail the website, ask if you could copy their complete codebase ;-)
[14:27:58] <gordian> but if nobody can solve it then you're right‚Äìit must be my attitude
[14:28:24] <gordian> console.log(attitude)
[14:28:38] <Intensity> :O
[14:29:57] <Intensity> Leo: http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html
[14:30:00] <BillCriswell> Think a beer might be in my near future.
[14:30:17] <Intensity> tequila is in mine
[14:30:20] <Intensity> and lime

[14:33:41] <Krambiorix> can someone take a look at this? http://pastebin.com/w4dHr7Gh
[14:34:55] <PhaseCode|Work> Hey Guys! Line 45 http://jsfiddle.net/bvyde/2/ I'm trying to change the dropdown value can someone help me with this?
[14:35:18] <Intensity> PhaseCode|Work: this too nub for me
[14:35:23] <Intensity> sory
[14:35:47] <BillCriswell> dropdown.val('somevalue') would do the trick.
[14:35:58] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, any idea?
[14:36:35] <BillCriswell> Not sure on the issue.
[14:37:11] <j3lte> Krambiorix, what's the problem?
[14:37:24] <Krambiorix> j3lte, line 25
[14:38:35] <Intensity> http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/assets/images/regex_people/stephen_kleene.jpg
[14:38:40] <Intensity> this gimp
[14:38:45] <Intensity> ^^
[14:38:52] <Intensity> invented regex
[14:39:37] <Intensity> In the 1950s, distinguished American mathematician Stephen Kleene invented regular expressions
[14:39:45] <Intensity> nineteen fifteeees
[14:39:49] <BillCriswell> Bet that looks good on a resume.
[14:39:49] <Intensity> loool
[14:40:38] <j3lte> Krambiorix, are you sure Firebug is not messing with your cache control? Or for that matter, Firefox?
[14:41:03] <j3lte> Use a Ctrl + F5 and see if it still happens?
[14:43:21] <Krambiorix> j3lte, i did ctrl + F5 but still...
[14:43:54] <j3lte> Might be a problem with your Apache server? Have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13707586/why-caching-ajax-request-is-not-working
[14:44:19] <Krambiorix> j3lte, ok thanks, i'll do that
[14:46:17] <Krambiorix> j3lte, probably the cookies
[14:53:48] <YammYcoding> var $foo = $('.foo');
[14:53:55] <YammYcoding> how i check if foo exists ?
[14:54:09] <YammYcoding> .foo
[14:54:46] <dismist> .length
[14:55:04] <YammYcoding> if( $('.foo').length > 0 )  ?
[14:55:22] <j3lte> correct
[14:55:28] <YammYcoding> ah right. thanks hehe
[14:56:59] <YammYcoding> hmm i put an alert after the if, and nothing hapens
[14:57:07] <YammYcoding> and there is a ul.foo in page
[14:57:13] <YammYcoding> any idea?
[14:57:23] <j3lte> have a jsfiddle example?
[14:57:36] <YammYcoding> i can show the page
[14:57:44] <j3lte> sure
[14:57:58] <gandul> how can i optimize this jquery ? http://jsfiddle.net/ksVuM/
[14:58:03] <YammYcoding> thanks =D
[14:58:25] <Leo> hi can someone explain why this doesnt work
[14:58:27] <Leo> http://pastie.org/8104820
[14:59:01] <Krambiorix> j3lte, the browser caches the ajax response and in between i can refresh the page, no?
[14:59:13] <Intensity> lol
[14:59:16] <Intensity> dafuq
[14:59:36] <Intensity> omfg
[14:59:46] <Intensity> dafuq to every1 who just posted
[14:59:50] <Intensity> w in 1 min

[15:00:03] <Intensity> D A F U Q
[15:00:08] <Intensity> \o/
[15:00:31] <rmurphey> Leo: can you make a jsfiddle or jsbin that shows what's not working about it?
[15:00:51] <rmurphey> although it may be thatyou are testing the same condition twice
[15:01:03] <rmurphey> regexNum.test(fname) && (regexNum.test(fname)
[15:01:10] <Intensity> lol
[15:01:16] <rmurphey> or that your parens are screwed up :)
[15:01:18] <Intensity> that wont error
[15:01:19] <fonko> guys, is there any way to know height of an image that hasn't ever been loaded yet? i mean, i have the src of the image... and i need to know its  height and width!
[15:01:19] <rmurphey> did you check your console?
[15:01:33] <Leo> not sure
[15:01:41] <Intensity> or that u have too many parens
[15:01:43] <Intensity> lol
[15:01:55] <dismist> php has a getimagesize() function
[15:02:02] <Intensity> srs
[15:02:09] <Intensity> (((lol)?
[15:02:38] <dismist> cant u preload it hidden, make it a box element then check height with javascript, unhide and apply?
[15:02:49] <fonko> mmm interesting
[15:02:53] <fonko> dismist, tell me more!
[15:02:54] <fonko> haha
[15:03:10] <fonko> what do you mean by make it a box element
[15:03:20] <Intensity> crap
[15:03:27] <dismist> or float it
[15:03:41] <Intensity> ok ebry1 stop coding
[15:03:47] <Intensity> before u do any more damage
[15:04:00] <Intensity> thats it ive had it

[15:12:10] <Intensity> ok i no maek fun
[15:14:35] <chompison> i'm having a problem with a jquery ui dialog box on a long page in which, upon dragging or resizing the dialog, it jumps down the page equal to the current scrollTop value
[15:16:23] <freebir> you guys, after I open my fade out window, the size of the page get too big, and won't go back, http://www.lifediagnosticos.com.br/preventser/
[15:18:35] <Leo> hay guys i would like this condition to work only when both conditions are true now one, http://pastie.org/8104880
[15:19:17] <Leo> not*
[15:20:56] <chompison> ...both of your conditions are the same thing
[15:21:06] <chompison> regexNum.test(fname)
[15:21:27] <chompison> theyre always going to be true/true or false/false
[15:21:34] <Intensity> so
[15:22:29] <Leo> huh
[15:22:45] <Intensity> lool
[15:22:54] <Intensity> ( o.o)_,,|
[15:22:59] <chompison> your condition is regexNum.test(fname) && regexNum.test(fname)
[15:23:02] <Intensity> ( o.o)_,,|,
[15:23:12] <chompison> you might as well be saying if (1==1 && 1==1)
[15:23:12] <Leo> i must be tired guys lol
[15:26:09] <rmurphey> Leo: in the example you pasted initially, you also had mismatched parens
[15:26:23] <Intensity> i told him
[15:26:27] <Intensity> he wudnt lisen to me
[15:26:45] <Leo> what do you mean mismatched parents
[15:27:30] <rmurphey> Leo: your if statement did not have the same number of opening parens vs closing parens
[15:27:31] <Intensity> lol
[15:27:38] <rmurphey> Intensity: please be nice
[15:27:45] <Intensity> huh
[15:28:17] <Leo> yes guys i have what i want but its a mess, im sure theres a way to narrow it down
[15:30:33] <rmurphey> Leo: in that small code sample there are some things you can improve but not a ton
[15:30:39] <rmurphey> for one, no need to return false from the if statement
[15:31:01] <YammYcoding> j3lte thankyousomuch! =D
[15:31:19] <j3lte> YammYcoding no problem
[15:31:28] <Leo> il show u the whole code in pastie one sec
[15:31:58] <Leo> http://pastie.org/8104911
[15:33:28] <rmurphey> Leo: so for one, you can make your $('.tick-cross') selection one time and store it in a variable
[15:33:35] <rmurphey> for two, you can pass multiple settings to .css() as an object
[15:34:03] <rmurphey> for three, you can be a lot more strategic about those if blocks and returning early if they evaluate to true
[15:34:15] <rmurphey> that is, if the first if is true, you're done
[15:35:26] <aghouseh> rmurphey in da house
[15:39:13] <Leo> ok
[15:39:58] <j3lte> Leo, like this: http://pastie.org/8104934
[15:41:06] <Leo> that great thanks i need to read it to see what you have done
[15:43:18] <j3lte> Forget that one.. made an error... http://pastie.org/8104940
[15:47:44] <Leo> how often do you guys spend in here
[15:47:48] <Leo> :P
[15:47:58] <Intensity> many
[15:48:08] <j3lte> Not as often as I like
[15:48:16] <j3lte> maybe three times a week or so
[15:51:16] <Leo> kool
[15:51:26] <Leo> are you a frontend developer
[15:51:35] <j3lte> Leo here's a variation to the code :p http://pastie.org/8104955
[15:51:39] <Leo> u from UK
[15:51:40] <j3lte> Yes I am
[15:51:46] <j3lte> NL
[15:52:08] <Leo> ok
[15:52:17] <Leo> what the hecks this lol
[15:52:43] <rmurphey> Leo: that is a bit more clever than i would choose
[15:52:51] <j3lte> true
[15:52:54] <Leo> ok
[15:53:01] <j3lte> I think I need some sleep lol :p
[15:53:13] <Leo> i want to validate an email address now
[15:53:19] <Leo> :P
[15:54:08] <j3lte> Google it!
[15:55:15] <Intensity> jesus
[15:57:03] <Intensity> \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b
[15:57:05] <Intensity> Leo:
[15:57:23] <Leo> lol
[15:57:29] <Leo> whats that do?
[15:57:38] <Leo> whats does is except?
[15:57:49] <Leo> how do you read that?
[15:58:29] <Intensity> email
[15:58:35] <Intensity> ok so \b
[15:58:42] <Intensity> is word boundry
[15:58:46] <Intensity> u can ignore that
[15:58:55] <Leo> ok
[15:59:03] <Intensity> then [.............]
[15:59:10] <Intensity> is a char match
[15:59:13] <j3lte> LOL.... rmurphey would this work as well? :p http://pastie.org/8104977
[15:59:23] <Intensity> \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b
[16:00:12] <Intensity> so A to Z then 0 to 9 dots underscore + -
[16:00:27] <Intensity> then u close the ] char mach
[16:00:32] <Intensity> and put +
[16:00:34] <rmurphey> j3lte: as long as it had comments :) i might also create the background-position setting as a separate var for clarity
[16:00:44] <Intensity> [...]+ means 1 or more of those chars
[16:00:55] <Intensity> then that @ syumbol
[16:00:58] <Intensity> asdf@asdf
[16:01:09] <Intensity> then prety much the same chars 1 or more
[16:01:11] <Intensity> for domain
[16:01:16] <j3lte> rmurphey makes sense ofcourse... was trying to see if I could optimise the code even further :p
[16:01:17] <Intensity>  then the tld
[16:01:18] <Leo> ye create one with the email thingy too :D
[16:01:41] <Intensity> so since tld starts w dor
[16:01:44] <Intensity> t
[16:01:51] <Intensity> u put \.
[16:02:00] <Intensity> which escapes the dot
[16:02:07] <Intensity> since its not in [.......]
[16:02:16] <Leo> im lost now
[16:02:20] <Intensity> \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b
[16:02:26] <Intensity> then
[16:02:42] <Leo> whats ths +/.
[16:02:43] <Intensity> u look for chars a to z
[16:02:54] <Intensity> no plus is for []+
[16:03:01] <Leo> whats the slash for?
[16:03:08] <Intensity> \. is .
[16:03:22] <Leo> ok ok
[16:03:26] <Intensity> so the last part is a to z
[16:03:35] <Leo> ok
[16:03:37] <Intensity> but only mach 2 or 4 of those
[16:03:47] <Intensity> i mean between 2 and 4
[16:03:53] <Leo> com, co, uk, and so on
[16:03:56] <Intensity> ya
[16:04:00] <Intensity> and thats it
[16:04:07] <Leo> whats about .co.uk
[16:04:13] <Leo> thats more like 5
[16:04:14] <shoky> uh oh
[16:04:19] <Leo> co.uk
[16:04:22] <j3lte> lol i was thinking the same
[16:04:27] <Intensity> dat one is ??????
[16:04:32] <Intensity> not gona work
[16:04:35] <shoky> screw those
[16:04:46] <Leo> lol im from the uk
[16:05:01] <Intensity> yu kno
[16:05:01] <shoky> meep
[16:05:16] <Intensity> i think dat .co will match by the prior
[16:05:24] <Intensity> :D
[16:05:32] <Intensity> its not part of tld
[16:05:41] <Intensity> its part of domain
[16:05:47] <Leo> ok so including 2-5 will use .co.uk
[16:05:55] <Leo> whats tld
[16:06:02] <Intensity> like lol@(england.co).uk
[16:06:03] <Intensity> see
[16:06:16] <Leo> huh
[16:06:16] <Intensity> .uk is ur tld
[16:06:24] <Intensity> tld is top level domain
[16:06:32] <shoky> nice to see ...@... is a valid email nowadays
[16:06:34] <Intensity> ie: subdomain.domain.tld
[16:06:37] <Intensity> see
[16:06:41] <rmurphey> Leo: food for thought: http://davidcel.is/blog/2012/09/06/stop-validating-email-addresses-with-regex/
[16:06:45] <shoky> sorry ...@...abc

[16:12:14] <Severity> lol
[16:12:17] <Severity> iz ok
[16:12:21] <Severity> i jus did
[16:12:29] <ajpiano> Severity: please find something better to do with your time
[16:13:18] <Leo> is that how i write this var email = \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b;
[16:13:21] <ajpiano> if you want to be helpful, you're welcome to, but so far you've been attidunal and then outright abusive, and now you're evading a ban
[16:13:52] <Severity> i am helpful
[16:13:56] <Severity> ask any1
[16:14:15] <Leo> ok then .....
[16:14:16] <Leo> var email = \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b;   ?
[16:14:22] <Leo> correct
[16:14:31] <shoky> no
[16:14:37] <ajpiano> i've read the logs since you've shown up
[16:14:52] <Leo> how u write it then wts missin
[16:15:03] <Severity> var email = /[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}/;
[16:15:28] <Severity> id try that since iono wat js regex does w b
[16:15:30] <Leo> thnks
[16:15:40] <ner0x> https://gist.github.com/5914071   If I use this function, hit cancel, and then use it again and hit accept it processes both functionRefs. The canceled one and the confirmed one. Anyone know why this is? I think it's a JS thing I'm unaware of.
[16:17:32] <Severity> ajpiano: i jus wana help wat can i do?
[16:18:11] <Leo> is this right
[16:18:12] <Leo> $('.fname','.appemail').blur(function(){
[16:18:26] <Leo> added another selector to the blur
[16:18:52] <ajpiano> Severity: don't mock people and complain about spaghetti code, don't use abusive language, recognize that you are assisting another live human being at the other end and treat them with respect
[16:19:23] <Severity> i was jus joking bout spageti code lol
[16:19:58] <Severity> my c++ is half spageti
[16:20:05] <ajpiano> Severity: have you ever been in an IRC channel where there are genuinely helpful people
[16:20:32] <ajpiano> if so... model yourself on those people
[16:21:01] <Leo> ive tried to add an email selector and its broken the whole thing
[16:21:03] <Leo> http://pastie.org/8105022
[16:21:44] <j3lte> $('.fname,.applemail')
[16:21:54] <ajpiano> Leo: you should probably just be using input type="email", it's 2013 and it will work in most modern browsers
[16:22:02] <ajpiano> and you probably shouldn't be writing your own e-mail regex from scratch
[16:22:10] <tw2113> email inputs fallback to text
[16:22:23] <Severity> Leo: y do u keep doing regexNum.test
[16:22:25] <Severity> lol
[16:22:29] <ajpiano> tw2113: right, but he won't get the validation in that case
[16:22:49] <ajpiano> anyhow, i'm out the door
[16:22:57] <tw2113> true
[16:22:59] <rmurphey> Leo: note that you're only including capital letters in your email regex
[16:23:02] <ajpiano> shoky: plz keep an eye on our new friend here
[16:23:16] <ajpiano> rmurphey: you too
[16:23:41] <Leo> och ive screwed it
[16:23:43] <Severity> Leo: its if (appemail.test(email)){
[16:23:45] <Severity> lol
[16:24:01] <Severity> ya ur super screwy
[16:24:24] <Severity> its CONTENT.test(regex);
[16:24:44] <Leo> http://pastie.org/8105029
[16:24:55] <Leo> can someone fix this and send it me back
[16:25:02] <Severity> nononononooooooooooooo
[16:25:03] <Severity> lol
[16:25:12] <Leo> ive got it to theres its screwed pleassseeeeee
[16:25:16] <Severity> VALUE.test(EXPRESSION)
[16:25:30] <Severity> ^
[16:25:45] <j3lte> I still don't get it why you want to regex-test the mail...
[16:25:51] <j3lte> I'm outta here
[16:26:07] <Severity> coz hakers
[16:26:18] <tw2113> gah, i wish i could get the jQuery blog's rss feed to actually work
[16:26:33] <shoky> uhm. it's regex.test(string)
[16:26:55] <Severity> oh
[16:27:04] <Severity> thats now how .search() works
[16:27:16] <ajpiano> Severity: answering questions is a great time for you to check something you think you know before telling someone else
[16:27:27] <j3lte> tw2113 what's wrong with it?
[16:27:37] <tw2113> doesn't validate
[16:28:00] <tw2113> http://blog.jquery.com/feed redirects to http://feeds.feedburner.com/jquery/
[16:28:08] <Leo> anyway all thats me done for tonight will see you guys in the morning :P
[16:28:27] <j3lte> Looking forward to it Leo ;)
[16:28:30] <ajpiano> tw2113: yeah you're right...it's this long lingering problem :/
[16:28:31] <Severity> lol
[16:28:38] <ajpiano> we really must fix it one of these days :///
[16:28:59] <tw2113> i'll be content for now as long as it's known
[16:29:07] <ajpiano> oh it is certailny known
[16:29:58] <tw2113> i'll go the oldschool route. bookmark it and check it every few days :D
[16:30:28] <ajpiano> tw2113: we tweet like every time we blog
[16:30:58] <tw2113> special tweetdeck column it is! so it doesn't get lost in "webdev"
[16:31:41] <j3lte> If you hook that up to IFTTT you can even do more funny things with it tw2113
[16:32:03] <j3lte> Like... getting an email notification every time they tweet
[16:33:35] <grafi> hooray for me
[16:33:37] <grafi> o√¥
[16:33:37] <tw2113> didn't ifttt have some issues with twitter?
[16:33:55] <j3lte> not that I know of
[16:34:22] <j3lte> atleast mine is working (nickname same as twitter handle)
[16:35:16] <Pavlov> is there a faster way to write: http://pastebin.com/iLyNA4RQ
[16:35:28] <Pavlov> it shows up in all my profiles -- trying to use it to do lazy loading of images
[16:39:44] <j3lte> Pavlov this might come in hand: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport used a part of the source for several of my projects. Don't know if it is faster though...
[16:41:47] <Pavlov> it looks like it would be about the same
[16:43:19] <Pavlov> it basically does the same thing i do, but also checks width
[16:43:35] <Pavlov> so i guess could be slower, but my guess is that whatever is slow about the first is cached for the second
[16:44:10] <j3lte> well from my perspective: using $w = $(window) in this function, and using that function on every element, is not a good thing performace-wise... but I'm no expert
[16:44:11] <grafi> how many images do you have that you need to optimize o√¥
[16:44:24] <Pavlov> too many :)
[16:44:33] <grafi> thats not a number ^^
[16:44:42] <Pavlov> dunno, say 100
[16:44:48] <j3lte> well you could use that source and remove the width part...
[16:44:59] <Pavlov> j3lte: yeah, but then it does the same thing mine does ;)
[16:45:17] <grafi> you should probably at least not create the $w every time you call the function
[16:45:37] <j3lte> exactly my thoughts
[16:45:48] <Pavlov> you think /that/ is the problem?
[16:46:05] <j3lte> it's a memory hog imho
[16:46:16] <grafi> hm
[16:46:28] <Pavlov> j3lte: yours does it *a lot* more
[16:46:30] <Pavlov> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport/jquery.viewport.js
[16:46:47] <grafi> so is your version slow with 100 images?
[16:47:01] <Pavlov> grafi: it is noticible
[16:47:09] <Pavlov> noticeable too
[16:47:13] <grafi> :P
[16:47:25] <j3lte> when do you call the function Pavlov?
[16:47:26] <grafi> how do you call it?
[16:47:29] <grafi> haha
[16:47:30] <j3lte> onScroll?
[16:47:50] <grafi> whenever the mouse moves :P
[16:47:55] <j3lte> LOL
[16:48:06] <Pavlov> its called debounce'd on scroll
[16:48:12] <Pavlov> but thats not as slow
[16:48:17] <grafi> while(true) { elementIsVisible ALL THE IMAGES}
[16:48:21] <Pavlov> well, its the same, but not the one driving me crazy
[16:48:34] <Pavlov> it is also called whenever some elements are inserted in to the document (the images)
[16:48:49] <Pavlov> and since almost all of these images are inserted in to the document later (after load), switching between things is slow
[16:49:00] <grafi> hm
[16:49:11] <grafi> nice little grave you dug yourself :P
[16:49:20] <Pavlov> but the time taken is about 40% that function
[16:49:28] <Pavlov> soo, not lazy loading is faster... o.O
[16:49:50] <grafi> hm
[16:50:49] <j3lte> var th = 0
[16:51:00] <j3lte> where is th used?
[16:51:11] <j3lte> or am I misreading?
[16:51:44] <j3lte> return eb >= wbt - 0 && et <= wb + 0
[16:52:26] <grafi> leftivers from unveil ^^
[16:52:41] <grafi> *leftovers
[16:52:44] <Pavlov> you can set that higher if you want more stuff visible
[16:52:49] <Pavlov> i've got it set to 3000 or so now
[16:53:53] <Pavlov> but you're talking tiny js microoptimizations which any jit these days should take care of
[16:53:57] <Pavlov> those aren't the issue
[16:54:05] <Pavlov> its the scrolltop/element width/height/etc
[16:58:09] <AlexLibman> I'm new to jQuery, and I've searched Google to the bone trying to get the sample on http://v2.tentcitynj.org/Protests working...
[16:59:53] <j3lte> I don't know Pavlov... let's try not to declare vars :p, what about: function elementIsVisible(e,th) { return e.offset().top + e.height() >= $(window).scrollTop() - th && e.offset().top <= $(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() + th; }
[16:59:54] <AlexLibman> First, that plus/minus icon after "Gallery of 18 images".  It worked before I converted to jQuery.  See http://v2.tentcitynj.org/ui/tc.js GallerySizeToggle - I don't think jQuery is setting .css ('white-space', 'wrap')
[17:10:05] <j3lte> AlexLibman I guess you're right... what you could do is switchClass
[17:10:40] <AlexLibman> I tried addClass/removeClass, but not switchClass...
[17:10:52] <j3lte> i'm sorry
[17:10:55] <j3lte> I mean toggleClass
[17:11:06] <AlexLibman> Tried that too.  Didn't work...
[17:11:37] <j3lte> Gallery.toggleClass('wrap') didn't work?
[17:13:06] <AlexLibman> And the second thing, while you're looking on that page, is more complicated.  I wanna have icons on top of a clickable thumbnail image, that appear only when the mouse is over that thumbnail, and clicking those icons would do something different than clicking the rest of the thumbnail.
[17:13:42] <AlexLibman> j3lte: will try toggleClass again...
[17:13:45] <j3lte> wait...
[17:13:55] <j3lte> white-space:wrap isn't even valid
[17:13:59] <j3lte> lol
[17:14:15] <j3lte> Have a look at: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.asp
[17:14:33] <j3lte> should be white-space:normal I guess? ;-)
[17:21:28] <AlexLibman> D'oh!  Thanks j3lte.
[17:22:26] <j3lte> At some moments I have a little trouble with css... this one... I should have spotted it right away :p
[18:19:25] <shoky> Codaraxis: your first example has the blur and validateInput on the inputs, not on the form (like your other examples)
[18:20:57] <shoky> guess you want smth like  $("#formId input").each( validateInput )
[18:22:53] <shoky> well, unless you make validateInput nicer, guess you can do with  $("#formId input").each(function() { validateInput( $(this) ) })
[18:24:24] <Codaraxis> shoky, my apologies. I meant inputId, not formId. Each Id that I'm using is attached to an input element.
[18:25:05] <shoky> is the code in a DOM ready handler?
[18:25:45] <Codaraxis> I don't know what that means, unfortunately.
[18:26:05] <shoky> $(document).ready(function() { ... })   or  $(function() { ... })
[18:26:14] <Codaraxis> The first one.
[18:26:32] <shoky> ?demo
[18:26:32] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:28:22] <shoky> minimal demo please. not more than 1 input and one validation needed really
[18:29:51] <Codaraxis> shoky, will do.
[18:44:30] <Codaraxis> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/G3aeV/3/   Everything except validateInputs() functions. Uncertain as to how to replicate the problem with jsFiddle as I wrote the function primarily so that it would check the inputs after a page refresh.
[18:45:05] <prbc> 3~/exit
[18:46:12] <shoky> Codaraxis: $("#title") is for id="title"
[18:46:52] <shoky> give your inputs ids if you're gonna select them individually (which there's no reason to do probably)
[18:46:54] <Codaraxis> shoky, I ... will go hang my head in shame now. Thanks.
[18:47:00] <shoky> heh
[18:47:21] <HaDAk> why does jquery not wait for an event to finish before firing the next? if i do object.fadeOut(1000).remove(), it removes the object immediately instead of fading out then removing
[18:47:55] <shoky> HaDAk: use fadeOut's "complete" callback argument
[18:48:09] <shoky> (or option)
[18:48:13] <HaDAk> ok, i'll figure out what that is. thanks shoky
[18:48:59] <shoky> HaDAk: np. only animations are queued by default, and .remove() isn't one
[18:49:37] <Codaraxis> shoky, what would a better approach than using Ids be?  $("input[name=blah]").trigger("blur");  still doesn't have the desired effect.
[18:51:45] <HaDAk> shoky: i got it working. thanks for the advice :)
[18:54:38] <shoky> Codaraxis: i'd prefer it more like this for starters..  http://jsfiddle.net/G3aeV/4
[18:55:34] <shoky> hate the idea of triggering an event just to get its side-effect
[18:57:46] <shoky> and use addClass/removeClass instead of all that css in your js
[18:57:52] <Codaraxis> shoky, agreed and much appreciated. I'm going to have to take a closer look at what you did, since it was exactly what I was trying to do, had been failing at, and had given up on. Much, much appreciated.
[18:58:05] <shoky> np
[18:58:18] <Codaraxis> Yeah, I'm planning on adding that next. I'd laso like to break the validation into its own type-specific function.
[19:20:01] <AlexLibman> css3 zoom sounds great, anyone using it to auto-zoom fixed-width sites to full window?
[19:24:44] <jasieverquery> any reason why this is causing a syntax error? http://pastie.org/8105380
[19:26:03] <shoky> jasieverquery: which error? what's $data, what's $filterType  etc
[19:26:45] <shoky> quotes around the $filterType might help
[19:28:52] <jasieverquery> shoky: sorry here is the whole thing. http://pastie.org/8105389
[19:29:44] <shoky> doesn't answer any of my questions
[19:30:52] <jasieverquery> shoky: line 4 doesn't? its a variable.
[19:31:04] <shoky> containing what..
[19:31:39] <shoky> obviously it's a variable
[19:32:30] <jasieverquery> shoky: a class. it adds the class active
[19:32:53] <jasieverquery> I'm using quicksand the jquery plugin.
[19:32:55] <shoky> $filterType is "active" ?
[19:33:19] <shoky> i'm trying to see what's causing the error.. help me out man
[19:33:30] <shoky> what's the error, anyway?
[19:33:51] <jasieverquery> sorry I'm trying to debug as well. I'll get it and paste it
[19:34:14] <jasieverquery> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-type=Category One]
[19:34:24] <shoky> <shoky> quotes around the $filterType might help
[19:34:26] <jasieverquery> category one is a class that is getting used as data-type to filter
[19:34:37] <shoky> you can't have spaces there in an unquoted attribute
[19:35:05] <jasieverquery> i did that but it doesn't print the class it just prints "$filterType"
[19:35:14] <shoky> ugh
[19:35:22] <shoky> $filteredData = $data.find('li[data-type="' + $filterType + '"]');
[19:35:55] <shoky> it's not a good idea to match based on the class attribute, anyways
[19:36:18] <jasieverquery> thanks shoky  that worked like a charm!
[19:36:19] <shoky> the order of the classes isn't deterministic iirc
[19:36:24] <jasieverquery> oh? I can change it
[19:36:38] <shoky> yes, whatever that is should be a data-* attribute too probably
[19:36:55] <shoky> data-filter-type="Category One"
[19:37:08] <shoky> var filterType = $(this).data('filter-type');
[19:37:28] <jasieverquery> ahh okay. yea I can make those changes. Thanks so much for the leads!
[19:37:42] <shoky> no probbies
[19:45:15] <initself> right now, i'm executing my function inside the {} of my selector like this:
[19:45:27] <initself> $(".add_list_attempt_button").click(function () { the meat of my program } );
[19:45:49] <initself> but what if i want to use { the meat of my program } with other selectors?
[19:45:59] <initself> (this is a basic javascript question, i know)
[19:47:01] <shoky> function meat() { ... }   $(a).click(meat);   $(b).smth(meat);
[19:47:24] <initself> you make it look so easy
[19:47:26] * initself tries.
[19:47:37] <shoky> you can also combine selectors like  $(".class1, .class2").click(...)
[19:48:12] <initself> shoky: does it matter if my function is inside $(document).ready(function() { }); ?
[19:48:36] <shoky> nope, as long as you're not referencing it from outside
[19:49:24] <resting> how do i query for an element that statisfies 2 attribute conditions? something like $("[type*='checkbox'], [id*='channel']")
[19:49:47] <shoky> resting: that should work
[19:50:02] <shoky> (but it'd be very inefficient)
[19:51:57] <resting> shoky: that returns input type hidden as well..i think thats an OR..but i need and AND‚Ä¶hm‚Ä¶what would you recommend?
[19:52:11] <initself> shoky++
[19:52:44] <shoky> resting: for an AND you'd combine them like $("[..][..]")
[19:52:59] <initself> to run one after the next: $(".add_list_attempt_button").click(func1; func2;);
[19:53:01] <initself> like that?
[19:53:14] <resting> shoky: ah‚Ä¶i see‚Ä¶that works!
[19:53:35] <initself> resting: what the hell are you using for an ellipsis?!
[19:53:36] <initself> ...
[19:53:40] <shoky> resting: i'd recommend first limiting the check to some scope in the DOM e.g.  $('#container').find("input[..][..]")
[19:54:47] <shoky> resting: and not using *=  definitely not for checkbox,  and instead of [id*='channel'] you should use a class e.g.  <input type="checkbox" class="channel" data-extra="something">
[19:55:10] <shoky> resting and then $('#container').find('.channel')  maybe
[19:55:17] <funhouse> Hey there, trying to google a function for turning 1000000 into '1M'
[19:55:21] <funhouse> what would i search for, i tried 'shorten number javascript' and 'number to text shorten javascript'
[19:56:05] <shoky> initself:  .click(func1).click(func2)  would work i suppose
[19:56:25] <resting> shoky: i see‚Ä¶good idea‚Ä¶i could give it some class and simplify the selection..
[19:56:39] <resting> initself: something like $("[type*='checkbox'] [id*='channel']") ‚Ä¶but anyway‚Ä¶gonna change it..
[19:57:16] <shoky> heh it's prolly just his irc client using a unicode elipsis  or whatever that is
[20:00:13] <funhouse> anyone know how to get an animation loop to run in background when tab is not active?
[20:02:02] <initself> shoky: am i barking up the wrong tree here? http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/
[20:02:13] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/1/
[20:02:36] <shoky> initself: you didn't put a function in click(..
[20:02:36] <ionico> hi, can you help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/PQFCg/   i want to use that function that works for any id,  something like $("#this").click(function() insted $("#IDname").click(function()		
[20:03:07] <initself> shoky: earlier you said - $(a).click(meat);
[20:03:17] <shoky> initself:  i also said  function meat() { .. }
[20:03:19] <initself> i thought meat() was my function.
[20:03:34] <shoky> only if you define it..
[20:03:39] <initself> i see, ya, i left that out
[20:04:40] <initself> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/2/
[20:04:56] <shoky> initself: you're still not passing a function to .click(...)
[20:05:11] <initself> i'm trying to do that here: http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/2/
[20:05:12] <initself> sorry
[20:05:17] <initself> var json_data = add_list_attempt();
[20:05:39] <shoky> you need to learn some javascript..
[20:05:41] <shoky> ?learn
[20:05:41] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:05:54] <initself> there ain't no doubt about that
[20:06:33] <ionico> what can i do so row2 works like row2 whitout changing the id name each time? http://jsfiddle.net/PQFCg/1/
[20:06:37] <shoky> also you can't just return stuff from an ajax call
[20:07:42] <initself> shoky: my alternative idea was to copy all the same code for a different selector and process the second function inside the ajax success function.
[20:07:51] <shoky> initself: this is a bit better.. http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/3/
[20:09:40] <initself> shoky: return $.ajax({}) is there if you need it, but ignored if you don't, right?
[20:10:24] <initself> pretty sure the answer is yes and it was a dumb question
[20:12:19] <shoky> initself: if you ignore the return value, it's ignored ;P
[20:12:48] <shoky> ionico: http://jsfiddle.net/PQFCg/3/
[20:13:37] <ionico> thanks a lot!!
[20:19:29] <initself> shoky: hey man, writing it this way now, does it redefine what $(this) is?
[20:19:50] <initself> because add_list_attempt doesn't have any of my data in it anymore
[20:27:05] <initself> i got it to work, but it feels wrong
[20:27:46] <shoky> initself: right. you can do this  http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/4/
[20:27:50] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/h2WSy/5/
[20:27:52] <initself> that's what i did
[20:28:07] <initself> so you did the same thing more elegantly
[20:28:12] <initself> so, it's ok to use this like that, eh?
[20:28:29] <shoky> it's alright
[20:28:36] <initself> in your fiddle, you just go
[20:28:41] <initself> var request = add_list_attempt(this);
[20:28:52] <initself> you don't have to do anything fancy to get 'this'?
[20:29:00] <initself> like: $(this)
[20:29:09] <shoky> and then i do $this = $(elem)  inside the function
[20:29:15] <initself> the bareword this will have ....
[20:29:23] <initself> ya, i saw that part
[20:29:25] <shoky> no, you always have 'this' in an event handler
[20:29:31] <initself> ah!
[20:29:34] <shoky> if you didn't have 'this', you couldn't do $(this)
[20:29:47] <initself> ah
[20:29:53] <shoky> $(this) just wraps 'this' in a jquery object
[20:30:03] <initself> isn't
[20:30:08] <initself> isn't 'this' already an object?
[20:30:14] <shoky> not a jquery one
[20:30:15] <initself> just not a jQuery object?
[20:30:27] <initself> i dont know enough JS to know if that matters
[20:30:39] <shoky> it matters, if you want to call jquery methods on it
[20:30:47] <shoky> which you can only do on jquery objects
[20:30:52] <initself> maybe i do!
[20:30:58] <shoky> like .data(..)
[20:31:01] <initself> $      list_id: $this.data('list_id'),
[20:31:05] <initself> ya
[20:31:09] <initself> that's why I do that, ok!
[20:31:18] <initself> but i am not doing that at the start of click()
[20:31:37] <shoky> doing what
[20:32:22] <initself> there's no need to put this in a jQuery context there
[20:32:29] <initself> shoky++
[20:33:01] <initself> ok, sweet, my code is basically working again
[20:35:21] <initself> shoky: $.ajax is returning a request
[20:35:32] * initself looks at the docs docs $.ajax first.
[20:35:41] <initself> ?ajax
[20:35:42] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:36:45] <initself> The jQuery XMLHttpRequest (jqXHR) object returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 is a superset of the browser's native XMLHttpRequest object.
[20:37:35] <initself> it's pretty intimidating to try and go from that to get the json returned by the call.
[20:38:56] <shoky> even when i showed you how?
[20:39:08] <initself> you did?
[20:39:10] * initself checks.
[20:39:18] <shoky> json_data should be the json
[20:39:25] <shoky> just like in the "success" callback
[20:39:28] <initself> request.done(func2);
[20:39:38] <initself> hrm
[20:40:11] <shoky> .done is pretty much the same as the success callback, just a nicer interface. and it allows you to add more "success" handlers
[20:40:24] <shoky> so that sets func2 as a success handler
[20:41:31] <shoky> i'm off~  good luck
[20:43:53] <initself> booya!
[20:43:56] <initself> shoky++
[20:44:01] <initself> hells ya!
[20:44:05] <initself> thanks so much

[20:49:10] <kid_icarus> where can I find the parent() method in code?
[20:49:33] <kid_icarus> I'd like to see how to algorithmically traverse up a tree and would like to see how jquery does it
[20:53:28] <dcherman> kid_icarus: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L147-L156
[20:54:54] <kid_icarus> wow.
[20:54:58] <kid_icarus> taking the red pill
[20:55:21] <kid_icarus> going to try to find browser source code to see implementations of parentNode in JavaScript
[20:56:07] <dcherman> kid_icarus: that's not all of it, you need to follow the rest of the function at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L184-L210 - that's only a partial definition for the parent* methods.
[20:56:24] <kid_icarus> dcherman: oh ok
[20:57:48] <systemfault> Just learn pure DOM...
[20:58:28] <systemfault> kid_icarus: If you really want to know how it works: http://domenlightenment.com

[21:11:03] <Palani> Hi guys
[21:11:30] <Palani> I have a json file from there i wann a wtrite to excel sheet....
[21:11:42] <Palani> Is there any possible in jquery
[21:12:54] <initself> How can I get 'this' into my function? http://jsfiddle.net/8jJTt/
[21:13:49] <initself> Palani: of course it is possible
[21:14:09] <initself> this might get you going - http://www.kunalbabre.com/projects/table2CSV.php
[21:14:52] <Palani> @initself...Any example or how to achieve
[21:15:16] <glencheney> initself: Use call? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[21:15:22] <initself> i mean, that's a pretty big question to ask that begs a lot of questions
[21:16:55] <initself> Palani: on click, retreive your JSON, gather it together and pass that via table2CSV to some external routine (Perl/PHP)
[21:17:30] <initself> Palani: http://jsfiddle.net/2gzVP/
[21:17:33] <initself> that's what I'm doing
[21:17:46] <initself> my example is gathering data from an html table
[21:17:57] <initself> you could easily make your data source JSON rather than the html table
[21:18:07] <jaydev> Hi... I have a question ... please refer this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RaznZ/
[21:18:47] <jaydev> I am trying to get div that have similar top
[21:18:48] <initself> Palani: I generate the CSV in a Perl script
[21:19:32] <Palani> @initself... Can you share ...
[21:19:34] <Palani> ?
[21:19:41] <initself> glencheney: so far that's way over my head
[21:20:10] <initself> Palani: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/259584

[21:21:19] <initself> and stream the data into a file that can be downloaded

[21:23:00] <glencheney> initself: Try jQuery's proxy? http://jsfiddle.net/Vestride/8jJTt/1/
[21:23:01] <jaydev> can anyone help me regarding this?
[21:24:22] <Palani> @initself... Sounds are good...But Not Pure Jquery right... Need to use some other scripting like php, Perl
[21:24:37] <initself> glencheney: is this retarded? request.done(attempt_premium, this);
[21:24:51] <initself> glencheney: is this retarded? request.done(attempt_premium(this));
[21:24:55] <initself> or something?
[21:25:03] * initself flails.
[21:25:14] <initself> Palani: it's true!
[21:25:23] <glencheney> adding another parameter just adds another callback to .done()
[21:25:38] <Palani> @initself... Cool...I'll try and get back to you....
[21:25:43] <initself> glencheney: right, thanks man
[21:25:59] <initself> still, your solution seems really complicated, and make me feel like I'm doing something stupid.
[21:26:08] <initself> maybe .proxy isn't complicated at all!
[21:26:10] * initself reads more.
[21:26:35] <initself> oh ya, that looks awesome
[21:26:41] * initself tries.
[21:27:07] <glencheney> You could also wrap it in an anonymous function and use call http://jsfiddle.net/Vestride/8jJTt/2/
[21:27:19] <jaydev> can anyone help me?
[21:27:32] <initself> jaydev: you need to be more precise with your questoin
[21:27:42] <initself> glencheney: which one do you prefer?
[21:27:48] <initself> .proxy seems neat to me
[21:28:26] <jaydev> Hi... I have a question ... please refer this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RaznZ/   ...I am trying to get div that have similar top , means filter div by similar top position
[21:28:27] <glencheney> They both really do the same thing. I usually use proxy unless it's a one line function.
[21:28:41] <initself> then i will too
[21:29:11] <initself> glencheney++
[21:29:13] <initself> perfecto
[21:29:18] <glencheney> initself: :)
[21:29:29] * initself vows someday to learn ECMAScript!
[21:29:37] <glencheney> jaydev: you want to get all divs which have the same top as the one you clicked?
[21:29:59] <jaydev> when I click on "open" I need to find the dive those are in same row
[21:30:19] <jaydev> so that , they have same top position
[21:30:47] <jaydev> I dont want to change HTML layout
[21:31:08] <jaydev> because that I am using in responsive layout
[21:32:37] <jaydev> so in as per current layout, when I click on "open" it should filter two parent div elements from same row
[21:33:03] <glencheney> you need to return true or false to .filter() in order for it to filter.
[21:34:31] <jaydev> how?
[21:34:46] <jaydev> I can not set the condition
[21:36:50] <glencheney> jaydev: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Vestride/RaznZ/1/
[21:37:17] <glencheney> compare the position of each .apptop with the one you clicked on. If it's the same, return true. If it's different, return false.
[21:39:24] <jaydev> glencheney: yes, this is what I was looking for... thank you .

[22:00:40] <funhouse> does anyone have experience with the jquery-ui spinner widget?
[22:00:51] <Woet> Spork2013: how is that related to jQuery again?
[22:00:59] <Woet> and is the MySQL injection intentional?
[22:01:39] <Spork2013> Woet: I'm very new... I'm using JQuery to create a slide-on mailing list.
[22:01:51] <funhouse> Spork2013: ##php

[23:17:28] <srikat> Cork: Can you point me to an example where I can get the code from?
[23:17:42] <Cork> srikat: as the "rows" is decided through overflow, you have to grab the exact position of each element
[23:17:59] <Cork> and from that detect what elements are on the same top coordinates
[23:18:23] <Cork> and then take the height of those elements and set them to the highest value of the collection
[23:18:57] <Cork> you get the top of the elements with position()
[23:23:05] <srikat> Cork: Thank you..Being a non-coder I am looking for ready-to-implement solution. I am going to try http://css-tricks.com/equal-height-blocks-in-rows/
[23:23:53] <Cork> srikat: ya, that does what i explained :)
[23:36:26] <srikat> I have http://pastebin.com/WefRsbwE appearing above page's </body> tag. Blocks are not getting equal heights though..
[23:36:56] <xboi209> how do i stop an input submit button from communicating with its parent form?
[23:37:04] <Cork> srikat: put a breakpoint in the loop and step through it
[23:37:26] <Cork> xboi209: make it not be a type submit
[23:37:44] <Cork> xboi209: either use type="reset" pr <button type="button></button>
[23:37:50] <Cork> pr==or
[23:37:58] <xboi209> i mean like, i want to pause its action when the user clicks it and then resume it
[23:38:07] <Cork> you can't
[23:38:12] <xboi209> D:
[23:38:23] <Cork> xboi209: use event.preventDefault() in the submit event
[23:38:31] <xboi209> i did ._.
[23:38:37] <Cork> and if you know you want to do the submit event do elm.submit();
[23:38:50] <Cork> (elm should NOT be a jquery object)
