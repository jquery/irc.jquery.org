[00:00:11] <Lucaszz> kevireilly: Thank you, and I must ask do you have any suggestions about my code and/or working with oop js and jquery ?
[00:03:58] <dokma> can anyone tell me why does this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wLAax/ toggles the checkbox everywhere on the label except on the checkmark itself??
[00:04:09] <kevireilly> Lucaszz: cork hooked it up, but you would probably enjoy prototype (and .bind(this))
[00:04:20] <dokma> in my mind the label should cover the checkmark...
[00:04:33] <Cork> kevireilly: bind doesn't work cross browser
[00:04:39] <Cork> yet
[00:05:22] <kevireilly> Cork: ah, honestly i just learned about it and only within node.js where that doesn't exist, thank jeebus
[00:05:42] <kevireilly> "that" as in cross browser, sorry
[00:06:20] <Cork> kevireilly: jquery provides proxy for similar effect, but it adds a performance cost that i find WAY to hight for what it does
[00:06:30] <Cork> `api jQuery.proxy
[00:06:31] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.proxy(): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[00:06:37] <dokma> the z-index seems to have no effect
[00:06:48] <dokma> is it jquery related or css?
[00:06:51] <Cork> dokma: do you have position relative or absoute set?
[00:07:04] <dokma> Cork, everything is as in the fiddle
[00:07:09] <Cork> link
[00:07:15] <dokma> it's not online
[00:07:20] <Cork> ...
[00:07:33] <Cork> then what does it matter if you have a fiddle if it's not online?
[00:07:48] <dokma> well the behavior is exactly the same
[00:07:56] <Cork> same as what?
[00:08:02] <dokma> there is no change in the checkbox state on a click
[00:08:16] <dokma> same as what I'm developing right now
[00:08:25] <Cork> sigh, good for you
[00:08:34] <kevireilly> Cork: ah, gotcha
[00:08:35] <dokma> well what is the problem?
[00:08:35] <Lucaszz> kevireilly: Is my example workin cross browsers?
[00:08:44] <Lucaszz> im asking about oop
[00:08:54] <dokma> I've provided the fiddle to give a short and concise example of my problem
[00:08:58] <dokma> and that bothers you?
[00:09:01] <Cork> dokma: donno, as you don't give any onformation
[00:09:23] <Cork> uh, you said you have it in a private fiddle
[00:09:24] <dokma> Cork, this is not enough info? http://jsfiddle.net/wLAax/
[00:09:29] <kevireilly> Lucaszz: honestly not sure, but prototype in general will. If you're interested in OOP, prototye is generally what you're looking for in javascript
[00:09:39] <dokma> Cork, I pasted the fiddle
[00:09:48] <dokma> in the first message
[00:09:54] <Cork> dokma: add position: relateive; to label
[00:10:07] <kevireilly> Lucaszz: rather, it is the closest thing :)
[00:10:37] <dokma> Cork, yes, now it works, but I don't get why
[00:10:45] <dokma> Cork, could you elaborate a bit on that?
[00:10:53] <Cork> dokma: you can't have z-index on an element that isn't positioned
[00:11:22] <Cork> same for left, right, top bottom
[00:13:04] <dokma> Cork, I see, now I understand it properly!
[00:13:06] <dokma> thank you
[00:13:58] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:17:24] <Lucaszz> What is advantages of using prototype in oop js?
[00:17:49] <Cork> Lucaszz: what are do you mean by "oop js"?
[00:18:12] <Cork> everything in js is an object, so you can't NOT have it object oriented
[00:18:47] <Cork> Lucaszz: prototype is how js define inheritance
[00:18:55] <Lucaszz> hmmm
[00:19:08] <Lucaszz> ok ok I have to lern a lot :)
[00:31:43] <redner> ok back
[00:32:02] <redner> when pulling code to reload for ajax - what exactly am i lookinf for ? i need to reload a title and a sidebar menu
[00:32:44] <Cork> redner: $.ajax, $.getScript, $.post, $.load
[00:32:49] <Cork> or what do you mean?
[00:33:11] <redner> hmmm- what code am i putting in there to reload these items?
[00:33:13] <redner> CSS?
[00:33:32] <Cork> $('selector').html(new_content);
[00:33:48] <redner> ah i kind of get it
[00:33:51] <Cork> sounds like you should read a get started tutorial for jquery
[00:33:53] <redner> but thats cause im n00b status
[00:33:57] <redner> lol
[00:34:06] <redner> i like how you called me out before i stated it myself
[00:34:06] <Cork> ?g jquery get started
[00:34:07] <b-ot> Cork: Getting Started | jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/getting-started/
[00:34:07] <redner> lol
[00:34:35] <redner> thanks man - yeah its for my own site - im just bootstrapping so just hustlin as i go
[00:34:43] <redner> i really just need to figure out the markup
[00:34:53] <redner> this is a good read though
[00:34:56] <Cork> markup?
[00:35:00] <Cork> for the html?
[00:35:06] <Cork> or do you mean syntax?
[00:35:20] <redner> syntax
[00:35:28] <redner> no i mean i need to literally figure out how to pop this in
[00:35:32] <redner> i think i need to go to his forum
[00:35:53] <redner> so yeah i read this - i get all that
[00:35:58] <redner> thats about all i get lol
[00:38:28] <redner> hey cork thanks for taking the time - gonna head out
[00:42:57] <hXm> good morning, i have a editable div and when i click on it a wyiwyg editor appears, but what is the event for detect when the edit is done, or the user leaves the div
[00:44:03] <uwjesq> What is a wyiwyg editor?
[00:44:31] <fabioportieri> wysiwyg
[00:44:32] <hXm> what you see is what you get
[00:44:41] <fabioportieri> hXm: depends on the editor
[00:44:44] <kevireilly> hXm: prolly .blur();
[00:44:56] <hXm> blur, i go read its doc, thanks
[00:46:03] <kevireilly> hXm: important to note that blur will probably only trigger if they click out of a textarea or textfield.. otherwise the best way to detect a done is with a submit styled button
[00:46:34] <hXm> yes, but the user can leave the div without saving its content and i just want to show/hide the editor toolbar
[00:46:46] <hXm> so blur will probably what i am looking for
[00:47:14] <okdamn> hey why these divs won't stay inline? :v http://jsfiddle.net/f7VdQ/8/
[00:48:19] <hXm> works, thanks again!
[00:49:01] <hXm> http://jsfiddle.net/f7VdQ/10/
[00:49:18] <hXm> it works for me okdamn
[00:49:25] <kevireilly> hXm: i actually completed missed the "editable div" part somehow, but im glad that worked haha
[00:49:52] <kevireilly> *completely
[00:49:56] <hXm> haha ok :)
[00:51:40] <okdamn> @hXm yeah it works but divs are not inline … :(
[00:52:02] <hXm> i changed relative for absolute and i see them at same line
[00:52:40] <hXm> i updated it
[00:52:52] <okdamn> @hXm i can't use absolute :(
[01:02:44] <PAGO> hello i am searching for someone who is expierenced with objects reacts on mouse, i can talk privaely about my idea. and how i can make it possible. :)
[01:04:23] <uwjesq> PAGO: Learn english and explain or hire somebody.
[01:04:27] <kevireilly> PAGO: window.onmousemove = function(e) { console.log(e); };
[01:06:13] <PAGO> sorry not everyone has english as his first language
[01:06:37] <xec_> PAGO: have you done any research on your own? what have you tried so far?
[01:16:11] <seutje> I don't like to talk privaely
[01:16:32] <fabioportieri> unless boobs are involved
[01:16:51] <lenswipee> did someone say boobs? :P
[01:17:04] <fabioportieri> uh? who
[01:17:12] <lenswipee> me want me want
[01:17:18] <lenswipee> are they big ones? :P
[01:17:38] <fabioportieri> they are huge: (    .    )(     .    )
[01:18:25] * Cork just felt how the iq level of the discussion dropped by 40 points
[01:18:32] <lenswipee> oooooooo Yeah baby :D
[01:18:33] <PAGO> I were just looking up some examples which uses effects, I can use. i dont want  solution i just want somebody who is more expierenced than me and I can talk about my idea and if they are realistic and so on.
[01:18:47] <PAGO> *a
[01:19:03] <lenswipee> Cork: you take the right, and i'll take the left.
[01:19:09] <Cork> PAGO: there is channels for hired help
[01:19:22] <Cork> here it is ask in the channel and wait and see if someone answeres
[01:19:59] <seutje> wow, look away for 2 seconds and things went to shit
[01:20:07] <Cork> ya...
[01:20:56] <okdamn> how can i add a wrapper div inside body tags dinamycally?
[01:20:57] <PAGO> I dont want to hire someone. well the good bye. Ive got is no specific problem.. so I see you wont care. then good be and have a nice day
[01:21:04] <duderion> hi guys, could anyone tell me, how to disable the bounce effect when using scrollTop on the iphone ?
[01:21:15] <seutje> $('body').children().wrapAll('<div>') ?
[01:21:40] <duderion> by the way, i'm using jquery mobile to trigger a scroll to the next article on swipe down/up
[01:21:53] <Cork> okdamn: $('body').append($('<div>').append($('body').children())
[01:22:15] <Cork> seutje: will wrapAll wrapp it in one element?
[01:22:27] <seutje> yeah, opposed to wrap which will wrap each result in it
[01:22:31] <seutje> `jqapi wrapall
[01:22:32] <Cork> ah
[01:22:37] <seutje> `api wrapall
[01:22:37] <b-ot> seutje: .wrapAll(): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[01:23:14] <seutje> I almost never use it though, as it looks kinda awkward
[01:23:14] <Cork> i think you will get problems with text nodes though
[01:23:26] <seutje> yeah, definitely, they're not considered .children()
[01:23:46] <okdamn> b-ot:  niceee feature thanks
[01:23:56] <Cork> <body><p></p><br>info<p></p></body>
[01:24:21] <Cork> will be <body><div><p></p><br><p></p></div>info</body> afterwards
[01:24:27] <Cork> okdamn: ^
[01:24:27] <seutje> yeah, but I don't think many ppl have text nodes as direct children of their body
[01:24:44] <Cork> heh you don't huh? :)
[01:24:53] <okdamn> yeah
[01:24:56] <seutje> in that case, ur solution would still work
[01:25:04] <Cork> i've seen it
[01:25:12] <seutje> psh, I don't even load a body element
[01:25:20] <seutje> it's implied anyway :P
[01:25:26] <seutje> I'm jk, I do :(
[01:25:55] <lenswipee> is it me or jsfiddle really slow right now?
[01:26:11] <Cork> seutje: like the 2012 google io, where they teached that html should be written with what's inside the body
[01:26:21] <Cork> the rest isn't needed...
[01:26:21] <lenswipee> what time is it over there in the US? people just waking up?
[01:26:23] <daanavitch> lenswipee: yep it's really slow
[01:26:27] <Cork> they got a LOT of flame for that :)
[01:26:49] <Cork> lenswipee: depends on what zone you think about
[01:26:55] <lenswipee> daanavitch: Right, probably under load now that US is awake.
[01:27:20] <lenswipee> Anyway, heres my problem. It may or may not load <-- http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/
[01:27:37] <Cork> they are between 03:27 and 06:27 if i remember correctly
[01:27:47] <lenswipee> Cork: Lets go with the middle of US :-)
[01:27:48] <seutje> Cork: Mathias Bynens did some crazy shit in that department
[01:27:55] <seutje> http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/minimal-html
[01:28:03] <seutje> http://css-tricks.com/using-css-without-html/
[01:28:11] <Cork> len so... 05:27?
[01:28:13] <Gazpacho> cork: as far as the standard goes, it isn't needed
[01:28:30] <Cork> Gazpacho: in html pre 2 ya
[01:28:47] <Cork> but no not if you want to be compliant with anything newer then 1994
[01:28:58] <Gazpacho> html5 allows it
[01:29:03] <Cork> no
[01:29:14] <Gazpacho> oh let's bet
[01:29:29] <daanavitch> funny how mathias bynens always explores the weirdest quirks
[01:29:45] <Cork> 1. html5 is a buzz word, and the html standard demands that you have the <!doctype html><html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html> structure
[01:30:08] <roy_raider> hi guys
[01:30:12] <roy_raider> juste pour confirmer
[01:30:15] <Cork> without <!doctype html> you have quirks mode and that means it isn't modern html
[01:30:33] <Gazpacho> cork, the html5 draft (which is a document you can refer to, not a buzzword) says the <html> and <body> start tags may be omitted
[01:31:02] <Gazpacho> (under specified circumstances)
[01:31:42] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/ <-- anyone spare 5 secs?
[01:31:47] <lenswipee> :-)
[01:31:54] <seutje> reason u need the doctype isn't cause the spec says so
[01:31:59] <seutje> it's cause IE is stupid
[01:32:05] <seutje> was*
[01:32:15] <Cork> Gazpacho: the standard is "html" html5 is a marketing ploy that was nicked and it means, ajax, html, css javascript, canvas, svg, spedy, animation, hardware acceleration, webgl...
[01:32:38] <Gazpacho> cork: so you're saying you won't check the document
[01:32:42] <Cork> so in other words html5 means nothing or everything you can every use in relation to the net
[01:32:54] <seutje> nevermind, spec actually says it's required, ma bad
[01:33:22] <daanavitch> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/2/
[01:34:14] <Cork> an html document without a title tag isn't valid, and that means you have to have head, body and html to make it valid
[01:34:24] <lenswipee> daanavitch: why didn't my code work?
[01:35:10] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: closest look the ancestors
[01:35:12] <daanavitch> lenswipee: I have no idea tbh, I never used closest() before
[01:35:21] <seutje> Gazpacho: what document? the ginormous spec?
[01:35:36] <lenswipee> ? closest
[01:35:36] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:35:54] <lenswipee> by that definition it should have worked
[01:36:14] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/
[01:36:28] <Gazpacho> cork: you've confused the omission of tags with the omission of elements
[01:36:31] <seutje> lenswipee: closest goes up the tree
[01:36:34] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: ancestor of table is body
[01:36:43] <seutje> table isn't a child of the h3
[01:36:53] <Cork> uh, elements doesn't exists in html
[01:36:55] <Cork> thats dom
[01:37:13] <Gazpacho> ok, that establishes that you're clueless
[01:37:20] <Cork> O_o
[01:37:56] <lenswipee> seutje: so i should be using siblings?
[01:37:59] <lenswipee> ? sibling
[01:38:01] <bot-t> lenswipee, .siblings() | jQuery API Documentation - Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[01:39:07] <seutje> lenswipee: or prev()
[01:39:14] <Gazpacho> cork: suggestion, stop relying on w3schools
[01:39:16] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/3/
[01:39:35] <Cork> Gazpacho: stop spurting nonsense
[01:39:47] <drager> I'm trying to make a theme selector with js and css; http://jsfiddle.net/qtAv5/ now I want to save that state with jquery cookie, ideas?
[01:39:50] <seutje> we don't take shit from cold tomato-soup! :P
[01:40:42] <Gazpacho> cork: go read an html standard document. any one of them really, since you've never read one.
[01:40:44] <fabioportieri> my liver hurts
[01:40:59] <lenswipee> seutje: How would you do it with siblings?
[01:41:00] <Cork> sigh a troll... nice...
[01:41:03] <fabioportieri> Gazpacho: u mad bro?
[01:41:41] * Cork puts Gazpacho in the nice ignore list
[01:42:09] <seutje> lenswipee: well, it's kind of annoying with sibling, as it just grabs all siblings in their original order
[01:42:20] <seutje> so you'd have to remove the 2nd of the siblings you got back from it
[01:42:21] <seutje> like http://jsfiddle.net/e4vT9/4/
[01:42:37] <seutje> rather tightly coupled and error-prone imo
[01:42:46] <lenswipee> Lets take a look.
[01:43:20] <paulvd> how can i shrink this image as it moves up and expand as it moves down ? http://jsfiddle.net/u39pK/1/
[01:43:58] <Cork> paulvd: that's like the third time you ask it, and like i've answered the other 3 times change the width and height of the img tag
[01:44:08] <lenswipee> ? eq
[01:44:08] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[01:44:12] <paulvd> Cork: that's coz you didnt understand my question?
[01:44:24] <lenswipee> eq is short for what guys?
[01:44:28] <seutje> equals
[01:44:30] <paulvd> i know changing width and height will do but i want to change it in proportionnnnnnnnn
[01:44:31] <lenswipee> equation?
[01:44:33] <seutje> gt -> greater than
[01:44:34] <Cork> more like you don't understand the answer
[01:44:35] <lenswipee> ah ok
[01:44:36] <seutje> lt -> less than
[01:44:41] <paulvd> here is the full question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16687245/jquery-shrink-image-as-it-moves-up
[01:44:46] <paulvd> i understand the answer duh
[01:44:49] <seutje> ooh, SO, my favorite
[01:45:07] <Cork> paulvd: in the animate call set the width/height you want to change it to
[01:45:10] <paulvd> i want it to shrink according to its position
[01:45:15] <paulvd> omg
[01:45:20] <Cork> if you change the dimentions the image will scale
[01:45:23] <paulvd> but then it will remain thattt
[01:45:29] <lenswipee> ? parents
[01:45:30] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[01:45:31] <Cork> of course
[01:45:34] <paulvd> i want it to shrink small as it goes upppp
[01:45:37] <seutje> paulvd: use transform scale?
[01:45:40] <paulvd> not stay in one fixed dimension
[01:45:52] <seutje> basically, window height / 2 = 100%
[01:45:59] <seutje> that's the center, right?
[01:46:05] <Cork> paulvd: you will have to calculate what dimention it should have for each time you call animate yes
[01:46:16] <seutje> so window height = 200%, and 0 = 50%, or something, right?
[01:46:23] <paulvd> so i can shrink it percentage wise? oh come on
[01:46:32] <paulvd> like at 200px its 40% of width
[01:46:36] <paulvd> at 100px its 20%
[01:46:40] <seutje> "percentage wise" is just a calculation
[01:46:42] <paulvd> top position 200px and 100px
[01:46:56] <paulvd> ok consider a balloon
[01:47:06] <paulvd> if it comes closer it is big
[01:47:12] <paulvd> if it goes furthur
[01:47:14] <paulvd> it becomes small
[01:47:16] <paulvd> same theory here
[01:47:33] <seutje> yeah, I get that
[01:47:39] <Cork> ... an html page is 2d, if you want it to look like it comes closer you have to make it bigger
[01:47:48] <seutje> I just don't get the problem
[01:47:54] <Cork> and that you do for the firth time by changing width and height
[01:47:58] <seutje> u already have an animation doing the movement
[01:48:02] * Cork won't answer that another time...
[01:48:04] <paulvd> yeah
[01:48:12] <paulvd> but i want it to shrink as it goes up
[01:48:17] <paulvd> and expand as it moves down
[01:48:18] <seutje> just add a width in there and set height to auto
[01:48:18] <Cork> >_<
[01:48:19] <paulvd> :)
[01:48:38] <paulvd> add width where
[01:48:42] <paulvd> in the image?
[01:48:45] <paulvd> then it wont shrink
[01:48:47] <paulvd> ?
[01:48:48] <seutje> $('.image').animate
[01:48:49] <paulvd> :S
[01:48:56] <seutje> what?
[01:49:11] <seutje> erm
[01:49:14] <seutje> sup with that CSS?
[01:49:15] <fabioportieri> boobs?
[01:49:23] <seutje> u set it to 100% and then set the max to 100px?
[01:49:37] <lemonsparrow> hi right now I am implementing jquery autocomplete in a very normal way.. what happens in this case is that the user, after selecting a value can edit the value in the textfield further... this is making me add one more validation to compare the textfield value with the other values in the array for autocomplete using a submit event handler to check if the user edited the value in the textfield after chosing it from autocomplete
[01:49:42] <lemonsparrow> make the users select value from autocomplete without being able to make him edit it ?
[01:49:54] <paulvd> yes so whats wrong with that ? i dont want to have a fixed height
[01:50:01] <motaka2> How can I change this to to the event of form submit  $("#content-in").on("click", 'a', function(e) {
[01:50:04] <motaka2> ?
[01:50:08] <seutje> well, u'll also have to fuck with the max dimensions then
[01:50:21] <paulvd> the dimensions are not an issue with me
[01:50:35] <Cork> motaka2:  $("#content-in").on("submit", 'form', function(e) {
[01:50:49] <lemonsparrow> how to implement jQuery autocomplete without being able to make user edit it after selecting value ?
[01:50:49] <motaka2> Cork: As I guessed thank you
[01:50:54] <paulvd> how would i detect the image is moving up
[01:50:55] <seutje> paulvd: k then, guess there's no problem then
[01:51:03] <seutje> paulvd: u are the one moving the image
[01:51:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't they have to be able to edit to make the search
[01:51:14] <paulvd> lol
[01:51:21] <paulvd> you all still dont get the question
[01:51:25] <Cork> >_<
[01:51:30] <seutje> u wanna use a separate event handler to do the resizing?
[01:52:03] <Cork> or do you want to implement a 3d rendering of html so it does it by setting z-index or something ???
[01:52:13] <paulvd> ok so i will add height and width to animate?
[01:52:22] <paulvd> but then ti will be one fixed height and width huh
[01:52:25] <seutje> or scale, whichever rocks ur boat
[01:52:38] <Cork> no, it can start with the height/width of the original image
[01:52:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes but something like.. a select list or something.. on focus on text field and then once the value is chosen from the the select list.. it should be placed on the non editable text field... something of that sought.. ????
[01:52:42] <seutje> it's continuously animation...
[01:52:48] <seutje> animating*
[01:52:55] <paulvd> yes
[01:52:58] <seutje> hardly "one fixed value"
[01:53:20] <Cork> lemonsparrow: just create a hidden field, and use it for submission, and leave the autocomplete input as a none submitting field
[01:53:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: aah... no hidden fields I want... no straightforward mechanism ?
[01:53:50] <seutje> I still don't understand the problem... save the original size and manipulate it based off that and the window height divided by the image's top height
[01:54:08] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that is the straightforward mechanism
[01:54:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what you want can't be done
[01:54:44] <Cork> sure you could set the field to readonly in the select event
[01:54:52] <Cork> but then the user can't change there mind
[01:55:18] <paulvd> yes seutje something like that....
[01:55:37] <drager> I'm trying to make a theme selector with js and css; http://jsfiddle.net/qtAv5/ now I want to save that state with jquery cookie, ideas?
[01:59:15] <Cork> drager: document.cookie = 'theme=' + value; ?
[01:59:33] <Cork> not sure what the question is really
[01:59:40] <drager> Cork: Yeah alright.
[02:01:19] <seutje> doesn't that asplode any current cookies?
[02:01:38] <Cork> yes
[02:01:45] <seutje> such a shitty api
[02:01:49] <Cork> well any none http only cookies
[02:01:54] <seutje> yeah ofc
[02:01:57] <FloLeBlanc> hi all
[02:02:11] <seutje> wonder if we'll ever get something on cookie like classlist
[02:02:14] <Cork> and yes the cookie api in dom sucks
[02:02:29] <seutje> so u can at least have like getter/setter methods
[02:02:39] <FloLeBlanc> I'm rather new to jquery mobile - If I want a responsive design page do I have to do the switch myself or is there an included way in jquery mobile?
[02:02:41] <Cork> seutje: as browser fight hard to restrict cookies even harder, i doubt it
[02:02:57] <seutje> yeah... rightfully so
[02:03:10] <drager> Cork: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/qtAv5/1/
[02:03:19] <Cork> i would say third party cookies will go away in a few years
[02:03:44] <Cork> drager: ya, that should be correct if i remember correctly
[02:03:54] <Cork> was a while since i used $.cookie
[02:04:08] <drager> Alright
[02:04:18] <drager> but how should I then do the check?
[02:04:22] <drager> So that theme is that
[02:04:26] <drager> if you know waht i Mean
[02:04:29] <Cork> check the cookie store in the browser
[02:04:51] <Cork> it should contain the theme entry after you click the link
[02:05:01] <drager> It does
[02:05:04] <Cork> btw you prob want to set an expiration date for the cookie
[02:05:09] <Cork> else it becomes a session cookie
[02:05:25] <tutu_> hello
[02:05:51] <tutu_> I have a problem to use parseHTML() with IE8
[02:06:03] <drager> Cork: Well, it should live forever I believe
[02:06:03] <tutu_> It doesn't operate with IE8
[02:06:13] <Cork> drager: there is no "for ever"
[02:06:24] <tutu_> someone can help me please ?
[02:06:29] <Cork> you can set up to a few years in the future if i think
[02:06:45] <fabioportieri> tutu_: paste your stuff
[02:06:46] <Cork> ?p @ tutu_
[02:06:46] <bot-t> tutu_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:06:54] <drager> Cork: This works, http://jsfiddle.net/qtAv5/2/ :)
[02:07:06] <tutu_> $.ajax({ 	url: "toto.html", 	type: "GET",  	dataType: "html", 	cache: false,  	//timeout: myOptions.timeout, 	error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){ 		alert("error"); 	},  	success: function(data){ 		var $div = $("<div>").append($.parseHTML(data)); 		alert($div.html()); 		 		$("#myDiv1").html($div.find("#myDiv2").html()); 	} });
[02:07:11] <Cork> drager: try restarting your browser
[02:07:16] <Cork> tutu_: no in the channel
[02:07:40] <drager> Cork: Still works
[02:08:03] <Cork> drager: do you restore the tabs on restart?
[02:08:04] <tutu_> how can i do ?
[02:08:06] <Cork> ?p
[02:08:07] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:08:19] <drager> Cork: Yeah
[02:08:27] <Cork> drager: ok, so you continue the old session
[02:08:40] <drager> Will try another browser where I dont
[02:08:50] <Cork> when/if you don't the cookie will be removed
[02:09:09] <drager> Well, it didnt even work out in IE
[02:09:10] <Cork> thats why you need to set a expiration date
[02:09:13] <drager> when I changed page
[02:09:19] <seutje> isn't there like a trick when u set cookie expiration before unix epoch it effectively becomes "for ever"?
[02:09:35] <seutje> prolly only in old IEs though
[02:09:49] <Cork> seutje: i think you set minutes from now
[02:10:01] <Cork> and the max value is like a few years
[02:10:14] <seutje> oh, must be confusing it with something else
[02:10:50] <tutu_> my code : http://jsfiddle.net/6JNpG/
[02:11:04] <tutu_> do you see the problem ?
[02:11:05] <Cork> an no it's max-age i think of
[02:11:34] <Cork> seutje: if you set expires to past time it will be a session cookie
[02:11:42] <drager> Cork: So what value should I set it to?
[02:12:00] <seutje> Cork: oh, I see
[02:12:25] <lenswipee> Cork: Whats the diff between cookie and session cookie?
[02:12:44] <seutje> the "session" part :D
[02:12:58] <Cork> drager: set it like 2 years in the future
[02:13:01] <seutje> session cookies persist till the tab is closed
[02:13:07] <Cork> drager: and then you can update it when the page loads
[02:13:11] <Cork> seutje: no
[02:13:19] <Cork> it persists until the browser is closed
[02:13:35] <lenswipee> Cork: tab or browser sorry?
[02:13:37] <seutje> right, which is like never for some ppl
[02:13:40] <Cork> or now days until the session is closed, and that is until you don't restore the tabs after a restart
[02:13:44] <drager> So 730 days then
[02:13:48] <Cork> so it can be months to years
[02:14:09] <drager> Okey, thanks
[02:14:10] <Cork> lenswipee: session cookie is a prehistoric beast
[02:14:16] <seutje> except if it's on a window, chances it will be formatted within the year are high
[02:14:22] <Cork> it was created before tabs, or session restore
[02:14:33] <seutje> man, can't even type properly toiday
[02:14:46] <Cork> and the standard says "removed when the browser is restarted"
[02:14:59] <Cork> the problem is modern browsers doesn't close the session on restart
[02:15:06] <lenswipee> Cork: what's it current replacement?
[02:15:13] <Cork> so a session cookie doesn't have a fixed expiration time anymore
[02:15:18] <Cork> lenswipee: there isn't any
[02:15:46] <lenswipee> Cork: then it's not so prehistoric
[02:16:07] <lenswipee> Cork: tell me about this session restore business.
[02:16:11] <Cork> lenswipee: it is cause the spec doesn't work at all with modern browsers
[02:16:32] <Cork> lenswipee: if you close the browser, (shotdown the computer)
[02:16:34] <lenswipee> Cork: huh? session cookie does not work on modern browsers?
[02:16:39] <Cork> the browser stors what tabs you have open
[02:16:43] <Cork> no
[02:17:00] <Cork> and when the browser starts again, it loads the old tabs; and for that to work
[02:17:06] <Cork> it keeps the session cookie active
[02:17:35] <Cork> so until you don't restore the tabs on starting the browser again, the session cookie is "in session"
[02:18:01] <Cork> and for me i think i'm closing in on 3 years session now :/
[02:18:16] <Cork> though i kill session/normal cookies daily
[02:18:34] <Cork> except for the ones i want to keep around
[02:18:56] <lenswipee> Cork: But you can specify the expiration of a session cookie, so even if browser reloads tab, it won't work.
[02:19:09] <Cork> then it's not a session cookie
[02:19:15] <Cork> then its a normal cookie
[02:19:27] <Cork> session cookie is specified by not having an expiration time
[02:19:40] <Cork> the moment it gets one its a normal cookie
[02:20:53] <lenswipee> Cork: For example, a user logs on to a site, you create a session cookie that expires when user logs out. Just saw your last comment, so you're saying that is just a normal cookie? that can't be right if its used by session
[02:21:22] <Cork> ah, ya
[02:21:27] <Cork> but that is server side
[02:21:43] <Cork> and then when the user comes with the old cookie the server says "heres a new session cookie"
[02:22:11] <Cork> i'm talking strictly client side here
[02:22:38] <lenswipee> Cork: right, well i never heard of client-side session cookie.
[02:22:46] <jay_> how to pass multiple variable here....
[02:22:47] <jay_> $(document).ready(function() { $.noConflict(); $('#destination').change(function(){									    var dataString = 'destination='+ $(this).val(); $.ajax ({ type: "POST", url: "select_package.php", data: dataString, cache: false, success: function(html) { $("#package").html(html); }  });  }); });
[02:22:54] <lenswipee> When i think $_SESSION i think server-side
[02:23:09] <Cork> yes it is
[02:23:29] <Cork> it checks the created header for the cookie
[02:23:31] <jay_> how to pass another variable from combobox here >>>$(document).ready(function() { $.noConflict(); $('#destination').change(function(){									    var dataString = 'destination='+ $(this).val(); $.ajax ({ type: "POST", url: "select_package.php", data: dataString, cache: false, success: function(html) { $("#package").html(html); }  });  }); });
[02:24:34] <lenswipee> Cork: Wait, are you saying there is client-side session cookie?
[02:24:45] <Cork> heh sure
[02:24:55] <jay_> how to pass multiple variable through ajax??? http://tinker.io/50685 Here it sends only one variable. I want another variable from combobox selected.
[02:25:00] <Cork> how else would the server know the session is still open? :D
[02:25:05] <imdea> Hi one question: I have application that comes with prototype library by default and I want to extend some functionality but adding jQuery code on it. I've already done my code in jquery and it works, it's basically to do some stuff when a select component is changed, but below my select component there is a button that is associated with a prototype ajax call, and once this button is pressed and done its stuff it seems like I lose the event handler coded in m
[02:25:05] <imdea> y jquery script... is there any way to fix it?
[02:25:12] <lenswipee> Cork: Here you are referring to a cookie that has no expiration date, and has nothing to do with $_SESSION.
[02:25:32] <Cork> lenswipee: it has to do with $_SESSION
[02:25:45] <Cork> lenswipee: $_SESSION wouldn't work without one
[02:25:54] <mobile8> hi, anyone in here using MediaElement.js?
[02:26:02] <lenswipee> Cork: Then is server-side not client-side.
[02:26:23] <Cork> lenswipee: $_SESSION stores the data locally, and creates a uniq id to the client
[02:26:32] <fabioportieri> imdea: you could replace the prototype ajax call with a jquery one?
[02:26:32] <Cork> lenswipee: the client gets this id as a _session cookie_
[02:26:46] <Cork> lenswipee: each time the client sends a request to the server it send this cookie back
[02:26:46] <seutje> jay_: serialize() the form
[02:27:02] <imdea> fabioportieri, not an option here... is there any other way?
[02:27:02] <Cork> lenswipee: and php uses it to find the current session for $_SESSION
[02:27:51] <lenswipee> Cork: How does the server-side session cookie come to play?
[02:28:01] <Cork> lenswipee: its where the data is stored
[02:28:11] <fabioportieri> imdea: paste stuff, it's hard to tell without code
[02:28:24] <Cork> lenswipee: think of it as a database where the client gets the id of the row
[02:28:33] <seutje> jay_: there's no html in the example you posted, I have no way of knowing what values you're trying to add
[02:29:03] <Cork> lenswipee: $_SESSION stores the data either in files or in an sql database
[02:29:08] <seutje> jay_: this would be my best guess: http://tinker.io/50685/1
[02:29:44] <lenswipee> Cork: and you calling that session data the server-side session cookie o_O
[02:30:03] <imdea> fabioportieri, http://jsfiddle.net/YzVgT/
[02:30:07] <Cork> lenswipee: you have a session, but not a cookie server side
[02:30:31] <Cork> but it doesn't work without a client side session cookie
[02:30:40] <Cork> cause then the server can't find the data belonging to the user
[02:31:08] <Cork> sure you can have a client side normal cookie for the session store too
[02:31:27] <Cork> but then it doesn't expire until the user logout explicitly
[02:32:36] <lenswipee> Cork: did you answer the question on what is the server-side session cookie? i may have missed it.
[02:32:56] <Cork> yes the last 5 lines i posted
[02:33:47] <fabioportieri> imdea: what's the issue again?
[02:33:48] <lenswipee> Cork: last 5 lines explain how sessionw  works
[02:34:00] <Cork> yes
[02:34:12] <Cork> cookies if client side, you don't have them server side
[02:34:16] <Cork> like i said in the first line
[02:34:45] <fabioportieri> after the first ajax call the change event isn't triggered anymore?
[02:35:07] <imdea> that's my jquery code. The problem that I'm having is  I have application that comes with prototype library by default and I want to extend some functionality but adding jQuery code on it. I've already done my code in jquery and it works, it's basically to do some stuff when a select component is changed, but below my select component there is a button that is associated with a prototype ajax call, and once this button is pressed and done its stuff it seems li
[02:35:07] <imdea> ke I lose the event handler coded in my jquery script
[02:35:24] <imdea> fabioportieri, when the page loads it works just fine
[02:35:45] <imdea> fabioportieri, but after i click on that button associated with an ajax call (prototype) it seems that I lose my event hanlder
[02:35:47] <imdea> handler
[02:36:17] <fabioportieri> can i see the code for the prototype ajax call too?
[02:36:49] <lenswipee> Cork: I think i'll quit learning from you :-) You knowlegeable but not a great teacher.
[02:37:02] <Cork> lol
[02:37:15] <Cork> lenswipee: what part doesn't you follow?
[02:37:38] <lenswipee> Cork: The imaginary server-side cookie
[02:38:11] <Cork> where did you ever get the idea the server had a cookie?
[02:39:00] <Cork> server has a session store, client has a cookie store server and client sends the cookie back and forth
[02:39:20] <Cork> and the sending of cookies is what keeps a session open
[02:40:17] <imdea> fabioportieri, it's very complex to find it actually..
[02:40:54] <fabioportieri> imdea any errors in console?
[02:41:08] <imdea> fabioportieri, not at all.
[02:41:42] <lenswipee> Cork: Right, you cleared that up and dumbing it down. Now i don't even remember what we complaining about.
[02:42:12] <Cork> lol
[02:42:36] <Cork> lenswipee: about session cookies not really being what they where meant to be anymore
[02:42:54] <Cork> "a cookie that should stick around for a short time"
[02:43:38] <lenswipee> Cork: the cookie created for when a user logs on is what type of cookie?
[02:43:47] <Cork> it might be
[02:43:59] <lenswipee> Cork: and expires when user logs off.
[02:44:01] <Cork> it might also be a normal cookie with an expiration time
[02:44:17] <Cork> the logs off is server side and has nothing to do with the cookie
[02:44:34] <Cork> the server just removes the data so the cookie session id doens't match anything
[02:45:02] <Cork> so when the client comes back with the old id the server creates a new one and sends that out
[02:45:18] <lenswipee> Cork: it either clears the cookie or the serside cookie store. dont know which
[02:45:34] <Cork> server side session store, not cookie :)
[02:46:04] <Cork> when the cookie does it is when you log into a page, and restarts the browser and opens the same url and you're not longer logged in
[02:46:08] <lenswipee> Cork: That's my cue to leave. Please we must continue again another time.
[02:47:02] <lenswipee> Cork: because the cookie is cleared or the session store data is removed? pick one
[02:47:07] <Cork> uh.. *not logged in anymore
[02:47:29] <Cork> lenswipee: for the browser restarted the session data isn't removed no
[02:47:34] <Cork> as the server isn't notified
[02:48:47] <lenswipee> when an expiration is set is the session store data deleted or both that and cookie?
[02:49:00] <Cork> no just the data
[02:49:11] <lenswipee> Cork: Bye bYe
[02:52:34] <imdea> fabioportieri, so there is no way of fixing it=
[02:52:35] <imdea> ?
[02:53:01] <fabioportieri> imdea: hard to tell, i should see the code that breaks your function
[02:53:30] <imdea> fabioportieri, it doesn't matter, it's an ajax call whatever it is
[02:54:14] <titas9x> https://gist.github.com/titas9x/5626481
[02:54:23] <fabioportieri> imdea: i would try to isolate the problem by making a simpler event handler and see if it breaks that too
[02:54:43] <fabioportieri> jay no pm, ask in channel
[02:56:28] <titas9x> Not working content fetching through ajax request  https://gist.github.com/titas9x/5626481
[02:58:19] <fabioportieri> i can't see nor jquery code or ajax request there
[02:59:20] <MickRip> it's coffeescript
[03:00:26] <titas9x> fabioportieri: there is no ajax request. actually ajax request through script
[03:01:04] <fabioportieri> titas9x: so what?
[03:01:17] <fabioportieri> i mean what's the issue there
[03:02:04] <MickRip> is coffeescript really worth learning btw? (serious question)
[03:03:05] <Cork> MickRip: depends how much the javascript syntax bothers you
[03:03:19] <Cork> for me, i learned it but i seen no point in it
[03:04:04] <Cork> (meaning i spent aprox a days with it and haven't used it much since)

[03:23:14] <Cork> INSANE_CRIP: i meant the script isn't in the html so where is it running?
[03:23:24] <xhoy> .find('div[class="even"], div[class="uneven"]')
[03:23:29] <Cork> no
[03:23:29] <INSANE_CRIP> oh right, it's in another file
[03:23:30] <John__> Cork : why you Cork you can't reproduce ?
[03:23:41] <John__> Cork : why you can't reproduce ?
[03:23:43] <INSANE_CRIP> <script src="/home/isaac/projects/autocomplete-js/autocomplete.js"></script>
[03:23:43] <Cork> xhoy: don't use attribute selectors for classes
[03:23:55] <xhoy> eeuh the classes live in multiple places...
[03:23:59] <Cork> `api ready @ INSANE_CRIP
[03:23:59] <b-ot> INSANE_CRIP: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[03:24:05] <INSANE_CRIP> ahhh
[03:24:06] <Cork> xhoy: so?
[03:24:09] <INSANE_CRIP> thanks Crok
[03:24:14] <INSANE_CRIP> i mean Cork
[03:25:03] <INSANE_CRIP> So that's like the "main" function for jquery
[03:25:23] <Cork> xhoy: you should never EVER use [class=""] to select a class use the dot notation
[03:25:31] <Cork> INSANE_CRIP: not really
[03:25:32] <xhoy> https://gist.github.com/sijn/5626621
[03:25:52] <xhoy> i know the searchattribute, but i dont know the random stuff in between
[03:25:59] <Cork> it is an even function that handles a compatibility for when the dom has been loaded (is ready for manipulation)
[03:26:30] <Cork> ok, so from the .random you want to select what?
[03:26:31] <INSANE_CRIP> So would I put my event handlers inside that function
[03:26:59] <Cork> INSANE_CRIP: the handlers doens't have to be, but the binding of the event listeners should be
[03:27:05] <xhoy> the col's that are even /uneven
[03:27:20] <xhoy> so all 'col elements' that do not have the header group
[03:27:23] <Cork> $('.random').find('.odd, .even')
[03:27:23] <xhoy> eeuh class
[03:27:36] <INSANE_CRIP> Thanks bro
[03:27:45] <xhoy> Cork: i dont know random :)
[03:28:19] <xhoy> Cork: https://gist.github.com/sijn/5626621
[03:28:43] <Cork> sigh what do you know then?
[03:28:50] <Cork> searchAttribute?
[03:28:59] <xhoy> i know .SearchAttribute i dont know .random (that could be ten differente things)
[03:29:02] <xhoy> yes
[03:29:12] <Cork> and you want to grab what?
[03:29:17] <xhoy> refresh, and even/uneven are used in multiple things
[03:29:17] <Cork> the col's ?
[03:29:46] <xhoy> i whant to grap all'col' elements, and change the 'width' attribute, ecept the 'col.col-answers' attribute
[03:29:51] <xhoy> except
[03:30:25] <Cork> $('.searchAttribute').find('col.odd, col.even')
[03:30:35] <xhoy> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[03:30:39] <xhoy> didn't know i could do that!
[03:31:07] <Cork> it's normal css selector syntax
[03:31:40] <xhoy> never tought about that :S
[03:31:44] <xhoy> stupid!
[03:31:47] <xhoy> but thanks for the help
[03:33:36] <xhoy> and can i stak them? can i do $('table tr td.even')?
[03:33:37] <lemonsparrow> Hi i have this jQuery implementation where when I select a text... I am appending a value inside a span... http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/uRtBC/ now how can I clear the appended value when the user edits the textfield value or presses back space or something ?
[03:33:57] <Cork> xhoy: yes
[03:34:31] <xhoy> does that need to be 100% accurate? or can it be $("searchAttribute colgroup col.even")?
[03:34:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: keydown ?
[03:34:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/uRtBC/2/ latest version
[03:35:04] <Cork> xhoy: except for the missing dot it would work yes
[03:35:16] <Cork> $(".searchAttribute colgroup .even")
[03:35:18] <xhoy> oke
[03:35:20] <xhoy> nice
[03:35:22] <xhoy> love jquery :)
[03:35:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: keydown looks good.. let me try thanks :)
[03:36:27] <xhoy> lemonsparrow: you can attache multiple events with .on
[03:37:08] <xhoy> lemonsparrow: sometimes you need multiple triggers (like select, change, keyup, keydown etc)
[03:38:27] <lemonsparrow> xhoy: Cork this looks ok to me http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/uRtBC/3/ can I improve this further... the #url value also gets cleared when I add random characters to selected value from autocomplete
[03:39:19] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you could try the input event
[03:39:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/uRtBC/4/
[03:40:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: nice.. thanks... so which one is better? input event or keydown ?
[03:41:03] <xhoy> Cork: last question, since were on it :), can i stack multilple things, $('colgroup.col-responses').parent().find('table').do something, and then $('colgroup.col-responses').remove()?
[03:41:06] <Cork> keydown will trigger on tab enter and things like that
[03:41:09] <xhoy> lemonsparrow: input, you can stack them
[03:41:26] <Cork> xhoy: stacking has nothing to do with this
[03:41:29] <lemonsparrow> xhoy: with multiple events right
[03:41:40] <xhoy> Cork: he coul trigger an event, on select for example
[03:41:43] <Cork> there isn't a shorthand for input that is why i used on
[03:41:47] <xhoy> Cork: and the enter key is true as well
[03:42:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that's right too but Cork he has a point there/... probably xhoy was just giving the additional benefits of input over keydown
[03:42:07] <Cork> xhoy: that is just adding more work for the browser for little gain
[03:42:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the keydown triggers before the input is updated, and input triggers after
[03:42:52] <xhoy> ah
[03:43:10] <Cork> and none of the none visible keys trigger it
[03:43:18] <xhoy> and yes, i was talking about the additional benefits :)
[03:43:40] <Cork> benefits of on() right?
[03:44:01] <lemonsparrow> xhoy: Cork http://jsfiddle.net/uRtBC/4/ in this example, is there anyway I can make the textfield non editable after selecting the value using autocomplete.. I mean.. a select list or something within the text field.. ?? since now I am having to add an additional event handler b4 submit to check if the selected value is present in the array or not..
[03:44:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/uRtBC/5/
[03:44:46] <Cork> but that means the user can't make another search
[03:45:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: i can still edit it :)
[03:45:53] <Cork> oh, wrong element...
[03:46:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/uRtBC/6/
[03:50:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok but this is not what I want.. in short the user should not be able to edit any value before he submits.. he can chose and then rechose.. but no editing allowed...  any solution for this ? xhoy
[03:50:26] <Cork> no
[03:50:39] <Cork> as if you can't edit the field you can't search
[03:51:18] <verysoftoiletppr> does any one know what's the shortcut to access the currently selected element in chrome console? $ something?
[03:52:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that's why I meant something like a selectlist within a textfield to chose from within the actual textfield.. or something like token input ?
[03:53:10] <Cork> autocomplete doens't work like that
[03:54:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmmmm
[03:55:37] <fabioportieri> uhm i have a general question, i may be off topic but..
[03:55:40] <fabioportieri> i often display an error message whenever a validation fails, but when it happens all the elements following the error message are shifted below to make space for the message, what's the best practice to avoid that?
[03:56:43] <Cork> only possible solution i've seen is to add the error message as a tooltip
[03:57:54] <fabioportieri> a dirty solution i thought is to put the message container in place, with a fixed height, even in the case there is no error.. but..
[03:58:03] <fabioportieri> tooltip uh
[03:58:40] <Dreamer3> why would query data() randomly not work?
[03:58:45] <Dreamer3> the data attribute is right there
[03:58:48] <Dreamer3> but it's coming back undefined
[04:02:04] <fabioportieri> data() doesn't fetch the html data attribute
[04:02:49] <Cork> it does
[04:02:54] <Cork> the first time it's ran
[04:03:15] <Cork> every call after that refers to an internal cache
[04:04:19] <fabioportieri> ah, right srry
[04:13:55] <mobile8> Does anyone in here know a good HTML5 player for (shoutcast) streams?
[04:14:07] <mobile8> or JS, or at least anything that also works on iPad
[04:14:34] <Cork> the video tag strandard doens't support streams yet
[04:14:44] <mobile8> audio tag you mean?
[04:14:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can I use token input instead of autocomplete ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/uRtBC/9/
[04:14:59] <mobile8> Cork: so I need a .mp3 file?
[04:15:12] <Cork> mobile8: static file yes
[04:15:48] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not with autocomplete no
[04:16:04] <Cork> well you could possibly use it in the backend, but there is no support in the lib for it
[04:16:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no not with autocomplete... I meant replace autocomplete with token inpit..
[04:16:33] <Cork> lemonsparrow: possibly, not sure
[04:16:36] <Kasimir> mobile: try jPlayer
[04:16:41] <Kasimir> mobile8 *
[04:17:03] <mobile8> Cork: but on some streams that work I see .mp3 as extension while it is a stream
[04:17:05] <Kasimir> mobile8: http://www.jplayer.org/latest/demo-08/
[04:17:07] <mobile8> Cork: how come that does work
[04:17:08] <mobile8> Kasimir: thanks
[04:18:06] <Cork> mobile8: it would have to be chunked and handled in javascript as far as i know
[04:18:15] <Cork> the standard doesn't support it
[04:19:22] <Cork> mobile8: btw, and by stream i mean that the length isn't known
[04:19:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have the array anyway sent to the front end and have it in a js string array.. all probably i need to do here is to use token input instead of autocomplete
[04:19:53] <lemonsparrow> xhoy: any suggestions mate?
[04:22:29] <mobile8> Kasimir: jPlayer also doesn't play shoutcast streams
[04:23:06] <Kasimir> mobile8: Doesnt shoutcast support .mp3?
[04:23:22] <mobile8> Kasimir: how can i find this?
[04:23:27] <mobile8> this .mp3 file in a shoutcast link
[04:23:34] <jay_> can some help me here >>> http://ipwebsoft.com/tpa/create_quotation.php
[04:23:38] <Cork> Kasimir: shoutcast is an m3u file
[04:24:46] <mobile8> its a link like stream.something.eu:8850
[04:25:48] <Cork> and as far as i know nether the <audio> or the <video> tag supports streaming
[04:26:49] <mobile8> neither does any JS plugin
[04:26:50] <mobile8> I could find
[04:27:15] <mobile8> not MediaElement.js, jPlayer, soundManager2
[04:27:16] <Cork> javascript can't implement support for a protocol the browser doesn't support
[04:27:33] <Cork> browser plugins and to some degree extensions can
[04:28:52] <Kasimir> Cork: m3u file is just a list of mp3 files aint it?
[04:29:05] <Cork> it still isn't supported by the browser
[04:29:20] <Cork> and yes it is, but the stream protocol isn't just a list
[04:29:41] <Cork> my point is that the problem is on multiple levels
[04:29:42] <mobile8> i have here
[04:29:44] <mobile8> a mp3 file
[04:29:46] <mobile8> that is a stream
[04:29:47] <mobile8> and it works
[04:29:51] <mobile8> in the browser
[04:29:53] <mobile8> without flash
[04:30:12] <Cork> mobile8: by stream you mean it is sent from a streaming server?
[04:30:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to replace autocomplete with token input here http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/uRtBC/9/ ?
[04:30:21] <Cork> or the browser accesses the file as a stream?
[04:30:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to find a plugin for generating a token input
[04:30:55] <jay_> can someone help me in onchange selectbox ajax search php? >> http://ipwebsoft.com/tpa/create_quotation.php
[04:31:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: doesnt jquery have it already ? like autocomplete ?
[04:31:38] <Cork> no
[04:31:52] <mobile8> Cork: yes
[04:31:57] <mobile8> Cork: its a radio channel
[04:32:13] <mobile8> Cork: the browser just plays the file
[04:32:18] <mobile8> a radio broadcast
[04:33:30] <Cork> mobile8: the only way i know of to do that natively in a browser is through the webrtc
[04:33:38] <Kasimir> mobile8: some browsers have native support for .mp3 files, it doesnt require any scripting
[04:33:42] <Cork> so donno how it's done
[04:34:07] <mobile8> Yes, but i need some cross browser solution
[04:34:13] <mobile8> either with JS activating flash
[04:34:14] <Cork> i know some sites send file chunks
[04:34:19] <Cork> but thats not streaming
[04:37:45] <mobile8> hmm
[04:38:44] <mobile8> Cork: can I msg u link?
[04:40:27] <Cork> mobile8: for what?
[04:40:59] <lemonsparrow> how to remove border of a textfield ?
[04:41:17] <Cork> border: none; ?
[04:41:21] <lemonsparrow> $('#id').removeClass('bordered'); doesn't seem to work
[04:41:34] <Cork> that would remove a specific class
[04:42:00] <mobile8> Cork: where streaming works cross browser
[04:42:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: <input id="id" disabled="disabled">
[04:42:12] <seutje> mobile8: in utopia
[04:42:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to remove border in the above input ?
[04:42:33] <Cork> lemonsparrow: style="border: none;"
[04:42:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[04:43:09] <Cork> mobile8: i don't have time to dissect a page right now
[04:43:56] <seutje> border: 0; is shorter :P
[04:43:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to add it here in js ?   $('<input>').attr({'id':'id_name', 'disabled': true}));
[04:43:58] <Xtrivity> Hello guys, I have a json object with a category array that is inside the content object. I am trying to figure out the best way to select the initial objects that for example have the category: logos. here is the .json http://jsfiddle.net/jJ6Nu/ . I would be greatly appreciative for someone to point me in the right direction.
[04:44:11] <mobile8> Cork: ok
[04:44:32] <Xtrivity> To elaborate, I'm trying to sort by category using that json object.
[04:44:32] <lemonsparrow> seutje: ^^
[04:48:03] <seutje> Xtrivity: http://jsfiddle.net/jJ6Nu/1/
[04:52:27] <Xtrivity> seutje: I will test around with that, Thank you.
[04:55:33] <jonathanochs> any c# devs around?
[04:58:39] <Sh4d0> hey everyone!
[04:58:54] <fabioportieri> jonathanochs: /join #c#
[04:59:39] <jonathanochs> :) alright
[04:59:58] <Sh4d0> i have a strange problem... - selecting a different option from a select element works in code (chrome webdev tools) - but is not outputtet on screen - did anyone have this behavior before?
[05:02:21] <Xtrivity> seutje: okay, I have done this: http://jsfiddle.net/jJ6Nu/2/ but I can't seem to grab the specific arrays of those only with the specific category im after
[05:02:24] <Xtrivity> what am i doing wrong
[05:02:36] <seutje> oh, that's what ur going for
[05:03:53] <Xtrivity> seutje: yes, sorry if I was unclear.
[05:04:10] <Sh4d0> no ideas? ^^
[05:05:06] <boytoy_> Trying to launch jQuery Mobile's panel on hover like the new Google+: http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/11/
[05:05:10] <boytoy_> But is there a way to move the scroll bar from the window to the panel? Otherwise the panel will collapse when the user hovers off it to scroll. I tried overflow: scroll; but that didn't work.
[05:05:43] <boytoy_> Or is this more of a CSS issue?
[05:07:06] <seutje> Xtrivity: http://jsfiddle.net/jJ6Nu/3/
[05:07:21] <seutje> wait lol, u can get rid of that sort
[05:07:56] <seutje> Xtrivity: http://jsfiddle.net/jJ6Nu/4/
[05:09:00] <Xtrivity> seutje: what does ES stand for, and how in the world is someone supposed to figure that out on their own?
[05:09:11] <seutje> ECMAScript
[05:09:13] <Xtrivity> I'm super appreciative, Just have no idea how I would have put that together.
[05:09:15] <Sh4d0> solved -> prop('selected',true) works, attr('selected',true) or attr('selected','selected') does not o.O...
[05:09:19] <seutje> `mda array.prototype.filter
[05:09:28] <seutje> `mdn array.prototype.filter
[05:09:29] <b-ot> seutje: Array filter method - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[05:09:54] <seutje> Xtrivity: basically, it's implemented in most browsers, but just in case it isn't we're defining it as per the spec
[05:10:27] <seutje> (like IE8)
[05:11:57] <Xtrivity> seutje: so you didn't know that by heart, you simply know that because it's on the net?
[05:12:18] <seutje> Xtrivity: I copied the definition from MDN page
[05:12:44] <seutje> I just know that filter is rather new
[05:13:25] <Xtrivity> seutje: is there an easier to understand method
[05:14:12] <seutje> Xtrivity: what do u mean? method for what?
[05:14:24] <freannrak> I'm dynamically creating new rows and have a link with an on.click listener attached to it. Problem is that the event listener doesn't work on the second line. I can't use clone(true) because it will break jquery.dj.selectable plugin. Any ideas?
[05:14:55] <Xtrivity> seutje: an easier to understand method to sort. I find that quite confusing.
[05:14:57] <seutje> freannrak: delegate the clicks to the wrapper?
[05:15:14] <seutje> Xtrivity: we don't need to sort if u just want to filter
[05:15:55] <shoky> boytoy_: did you mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WCP4F/13/
[05:16:02] <freannrak> seutje: could you please direct me some good documentation or/and code examples how to do it? I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[05:16:47] <seutje> freannrak: instead of $('table a.foo').bind('click', function(){...}), use $('table').on('click', 'a.foo', function() {...})
[05:16:57] <Xtrivity> seutje: i'm referring to the EM stuff.
[05:17:42] <seutje> freannrak: this is the theory behind it: http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[05:17:49] <freannrak> seutje: excellent idea. Thanks a lot :=).
[05:17:55] <seutje> freannrak: but I suggest running through the .on() api page for jquery
[05:18:02] <seutje> `api on
[05:18:02] <b-ot> seutje: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:18:32] <seutje> Xtrivity: u mean how to know what versions it's available in?
[05:18:33] <boytoy_> shoky: ha! i most certainly do!
[05:18:55] <Xtrivity> seutje: yes.
[05:19:00] <boytoy_> nicely done good sir =)
[05:19:43] <seutje> Xtrivity: basically, I just go "I wanna sort an array... is there an array.sort method? google google... yes there is! when was it introduced? after IE8 was released! so if I wanna support IE8... I better check if it's available and create my own if it isn't... let's grab this definition..."
[05:20:44] <seutje> replace all instances of "sort" with "filter" in that lil story :P
[05:20:51] <Xtrivity> haha alright.
[05:20:53] <Xtrivity> Thanks.
[05:21:15] <seutje> array.sort has been around since the beginning, pretty much
[05:21:35] <seutje> hope that helped
[05:25:53] <mobile8> Does anyone know a good jQuery shoutcast player?
[05:26:09] <boytoy_> shoky: surprised this isnt in jquery mobile's css
[05:26:20] <boytoy_> shoky: u wanna do the pull request or should i?
[05:30:08] <anli_> Can I have .animate pay attention to the css style animation-duration?

[05:41:25] <shoky> boytoy_: i don't know that that should be the default css
[05:42:05] <Musk> anyone know's a good doc on how to set class attributes via accessing jqmData(role='footer') or header
[05:43:20] <boytoy_> hmmm yeah i dunno either ill ask them though
[05:43:25] <boytoy_> tell them my pal shoky came up with it
[05:44:21] <Guest99268> Hi everyone! I have a question on ajax/promise interface :)
[05:44:27] <shoky> Musk: what do you mean?
[05:44:46] <Musk> its just i can't force the ui-btn-active unto my links
[05:44:56] <Musk> :/
[05:45:02] <shoky> what does it have to do with jqmData?
[05:45:07] <Guest99268> I would like to re-send an ajax request, but my callback are in the promise jqxhr object and not in the options
[05:45:15] <Musk> access the footer that contains the links
[05:45:43] <Musk> i was told the most perfomant way to access it is using jqmData
[05:46:03] <Guest99268> how i do to resend an ajax request with an existing options and jqxhr objects?
[05:46:51] <shoky> Musk: sure.. but that has nothing to do with setting classes on elements
[05:47:28] <Musk> $(":jqmData(role='footer') a") <-  understand ?
[05:47:45] <shoky> yes. it happens to be in the footer
[05:47:59] <caddoo> If I have $('<div/>') how do I return that as HTML
[05:48:27] <Musk> shoky i try to assign events, and its not firing those events
[05:49:13] <shoky> Musk: you keep talking about a different things. these have nothing to do with each other:  accessing the footer,  setting classes,  assigning event handlers
[05:49:31] <shoky> Musk: make a minimal jsfiddle showing your problem
[05:50:00] <mobile8> Does anyone know a good jQuery shoutcast player?
[05:50:09] <Musk> shoky they are not different things, its one thing.. all i want is my events to fire on element using jqmData its not complicated to understand.
[05:50:27] <shoky> `demo @ Musk
[05:50:28] <b-ot> Musk: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:51:24] <shoky> caddoo: .prop('outerHTML')
[06:04:01] <Error404NotFound> I have an object collection as a result of query. How would i call click() on all of them without using for loop with objects.size(). It should probably work with each(), i might be missing something.
[06:04:51] <Error404NotFound> figured it out
[06:04:54] <shoky> .click() ?
[06:12:41] <xec_> objects.size() ??
[06:15:43] <shoky> supermodels ???
[06:17:18] <seutje> Error404NotFound: don't use .size(), it's silly, use .length instead
[06:18:10] <Error404NotFound> i ended up doing something like $('qualifiers).each(function() { $(this).click(); });
[06:18:22] <xec_> you don't need the each afaik
[06:18:46] <shoky> yerp
[06:18:49] <xec_> just myCollection.click()
[06:19:14] <xec_> triggers click on all elements in the collection
[06:20:34] <dwarder> in php i did redirect(myurl) on myurl there are ajax queries upon $(document).ready(function()  they got executed, but not when i redirect to my url
[06:21:05] <dwarder> so, when i just enter myurl in my browser Ajax goes all good
[06:21:29] <dwarder> what is in redirect that prevents Ajax from running?
[06:22:29] <xec_> dwarder: a redirect wouldn't interfere with the script on the page, something else is likely the issue
[06:24:02] <Error404NotFound> awesome.
[06:24:08] <Error404NotFound> xec_: shoky thanks
[06:27:13] <Guest99268> Plz someone can explain to me how i can resend an ajax request from the ajaxError handler with the new deferred/promise interface?
[06:28:02] <shoky> Guest99268: how about the same way that you sent the original request?
[06:29:39] <Guest99268> yes but the new call to $.ajax with my existing settings doesn't execute my callbacks
[06:29:42] <shoky> oh, you mean the global ajaxError ?
[06:30:06] <Guest99268> cause my callbacks are not in the settings but in the jqxhr / promise given in the ajaxError handler
[06:30:16] <Guest99268> shoky, yes
[06:30:28] <shoky> when you sent the original request, you added callbacks
[06:30:35] <shoky> do that again?
[06:31:11] <Guest99268> shoky: my callbacks are set in my app, and i don't want to dupplicate them
[06:31:40] <shoky> functions are good for reusability and non-duplication
[06:32:02] <Guest99268> but my callbacks are anonymous functions
[06:32:13] <Guest99268> they are uniqs
[06:32:39] <shoky> that's besides the point, but since you mentioned it, nobody said they have to be anonymous
[06:32:46] <shoky> don't know what a uniq is
[06:33:48] <Guest99268> unique
[06:33:58] <Guest99268> different
[06:34:33] <Guest99268> and in your way how i know what callback to add to my new jqxhr ?
[06:35:30] <shoky> i don't know of anything to help you do it automatically
[06:35:42] <xec_> function doajax () { $.ajax().fail(doajax) } ?
[06:37:04] <shoky> yeah but:  function doajax() { return $.ajax()... }     doajax().done(fn1).fail(fn2);     doajax().done(fn3).fail(fn4);      wut.
[06:37:38] <shoky> i guess he's talking about something more like that.. donno really
[06:38:16] <Guest99268> that is ugly, do you know how i can retrieve the callback stack from a deferred object?
[06:38:38] <xec_> yeah, i'm confused too, but if i had to take a wild guess, maybe he wants to create an automatic retry on ajax fail globally
[06:38:39] <sacho> why would you need to do that?
[06:38:49] <shoky> and retrieving the callback stack ISN'T ugly?
[06:38:50] <xec_> not sure if/how you can do that
[06:39:03] <sacho> oh, I see.
[06:39:22] <sacho> Guest99268, this is simply solved by adding an additional deferred.
[06:39:29] <Guest99268> i want resend my ajax request on error to change an api key and retry for example
[06:39:52] <Guest99268> sacho: can you explain me how ?
[06:42:14] <Guest99268> sacho, can you develop your idea please?
[06:43:28] <c4ptnh00k> morning guys
[06:43:29] <jedimind> yeah, sacho, can you just do it for him ?
[06:43:44] <pachet> jedimind you do it for sacho, then he'll do it for Guest99268
[06:43:47] <pachet> and i'll get a coffee
[06:43:49] <pachet> meet back in 10?
[06:43:51] <jedimind> deal
[06:44:00] <jedimind> i dont know what we're doing but ima do it anyway
[06:44:04] <shoky> who will get ME a coffee
[06:44:11] * xec_ sits on shoky
[06:44:20] <shoky> good enough
[06:44:20] <sacho> Guest99268, one way to do it globally would be this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11793430/retry-a-jquery-ajax-request-which-has-callbacks-attached-to-its-deferred
[06:45:57] <Guest99268> sacho, thx
[06:46:12] <sacho> the prefilter part is mostly irrelevant to your question
[06:46:37] <lemonsparrow> how to access www.naveen.net using js ? http://pastebin.com/vRMNc9KV
[06:47:07] <c4ptnh00k> Im looking for a way to validate elements on my form without doing a submit. I have the jquery validation plugin. any ideas?
[06:47:14] <jedimind> yes
[06:47:18] <jedimind> apply said validation plugin
[06:47:23] <jedimind> and then, you're done
[06:47:35] <jedimind> maybe adjust a setting or two?
[06:47:35] <xec_> lemonsparrow: window.location = "http://www.naveen.net"
[06:47:39] <xec_> trololol
[06:47:55] <c4ptnh00k> I thought that event was only handeled on .submit()
[06:48:07] <pachet> xec_: \o
[06:48:21] <xec_> o/ pachet
[06:49:30] <sacho> Guest99268, the gist of the idea is to attach your .done() and .fail() callbacks to a deferred you've created. That deferred is what actually does the ajax call, and optionally retries it.
[06:49:34] <xec_> c4ptnh00k: is this what you're talking about? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#options
[06:49:47] <sacho> Guest99268, that way, your deferred can fail at a point that you've decided.
[06:50:22] <redshark50> Good afternoon
[06:50:31] <sacho> Guest99268, on that thread, dherman's post demonstrates the concept most clearly.
[06:51:15] <c4ptnh00k> xec_ yup and I just read that wrong the first time. I see that I can use the onclick event now. Thanks.
[06:52:07] <redshark50> I have two divs with the same class name that appear one after each other within a container div. I'd like to remove them both but at the moment I'm using $('.Container .sectiondata:first').remove();
[06:52:21] <jedimind> so dont use :first ?
[06:52:27] <jedimind> ...
[06:52:45] <redshark50> which removes the first, I presume there is a better way of simply using the same $('.Container .sectiondata:first').remove(); again to remove the second
[06:53:00] <redshark50> @jedimind, how do I tell it to select the two?
[06:53:06] <redshark50> is my question
[06:53:10] <jedimind> just two ? not all of them ?
[06:53:24] <jedimind> are there more of the same element in the container, and you just want to remove two ?
[06:53:25] <redshark50> yes, the first two
[06:53:31] <redshark50> that's correct
[06:54:22] <shoky> $('.Container .sectiondata').slice(0, 2).remove()
[06:55:14] <shoky> or maybe :lt(2)  would do the job
[06:55:27] <redshark50> shoky: the first did the trick
[06:55:33] <redshark50> thank you.
[06:56:22] <xec_> shoky: according to the :lt() docs, slice is preferred anyway
[06:56:54] <shoky> ah
[07:02:09] <xinming> When I do post params with jquery
[07:02:35] <xinming> When I do post params with jquery for an array, It'll automatically append the [] to the query string. Is it possible to disable this behavior?
[07:06:17] <PugSQL> Anyone had any experience with Jquery UI Maps?
[07:12:20] <v0lksman> is there a better way to do this:  $('.delete_action[rel=action_item_2]').parent().parent().parent().parent()
[07:12:46] <sacho> v0lksman, you could use .closest() and a selector
[07:13:38] <v0lksman> sacho: does that always go up...closest implies it may find things after if they are closer than the ones before.
[07:13:41] <v0lksman> if that makes any sense
[07:14:10] <jedimind> $('.selector').parents('#parent').eq(0);
[07:14:12] <jedimind> v0lksman
[07:14:24] <jedimind> use a selector for the parent with parents
[07:14:37] <jedimind> and eq(0) will return just the first one it finds so it doesnt continue traversing upwards
[07:14:40] <sacho> v0lksman, are you using the dictionary definition of closest or the documentation?
[07:15:00] <sacho> by the time you call .eq(0), it would have already selected all parents and filtered them
[07:15:17] <v0lksman> sacho: dictionary...
[07:15:21] <jedimind> i realized that as i hit enter
[07:15:30] <sacho> v0lksman, that's silly. Use the documentation.
[07:15:33] <v0lksman> hahaha
[07:15:34] <v0lksman> ok
[07:15:58] <v0lksman> up
[07:16:02] <v0lksman> beauty
[07:16:06] <v0lksman> thanks sacho
[07:18:14] <c4ptnh00k> in this example is fruit a name or an ID? $("#myform").validate({rules:fruit:"required"}
[07:18:14] <c4ptnh00k> });
[07:19:23] <sacho> Doesn't the jquery validation plugin have documentation? I'll guess it's a name.
[07:19:35] <slide> Does anyone know how I can remove an element being dragged from its current place in the dom and keep it dragging? I've tried to .remove() it and add it to a div at the end of the page, but it wont keep dragging that way
[07:19:37] <c4ptnh00k> i got this example from the documentation
[07:20:06] <c4ptnh00k> the element has a name and an id of fruit and does not say which one its selecting
[07:20:20] <sacho> slide, how are you dragging the element?
[07:20:41] <slide> using .draggable()
[07:20:44] <sacho> slide, an easier solution would be to have the dragging executed on your new element altogether.
[07:20:45] <Wolf_22> I have a header that I've set to animate when a circle on the right-side of this is clicked on. The problem I'm having is that the opacity inside the animation functionality seems to get "stuck" and not work correctly if the circle is clicked on before the animation is done being processed. Why is this? http://jsfiddle.net/nyaH5/
[07:20:47] <slide> in jquery ui
[07:21:08] <Aamir> slide: like http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[07:21:10] <Aamir> opps
[07:21:11] <slide> sacho, hrm 'new' element?
[07:21:18] <Aamir> http://pmp.aamirafridi.com/_rpg/
[07:21:52] <slide> I essentially want to get rid of the original placeholder
[07:21:57] <slide> once you start dragging
[07:22:04] <slide> so the html shows how it would look without it
[07:22:24] <slide> s/html/page/
[07:23:06] <sacho> doesn't draggable have an option not to have a placeholder?
[07:23:29] <slide> hrm
[07:24:31] <slide> not that I ses =\
[07:25:38] <Woet> is it possible for the jQuery UI slider to have different increments between steps without specifying all the options manually?
[07:25:50] <Woet> e.g, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200
[07:27:59] <slide> ok i can set the helper property to 'clone' which lets me drag the item still after removing it from the dom so I think this should work
[07:31:11] <shoky> slide: if you want the dragged item to be appended somewhere else you can use the 'appendTo' option
[07:31:50] <Xal_> Has anyone heard of a problem where wrapInner causes the javascript process to crash?
[07:35:58] <PhanLord> jquery-mobile question, how can i make my fullscreen headers to ignore click and not disapear or show
[07:46:53] <Woet> http://jsfiddle.net/xmE6R/ - why doesn't this code change the values of the slider?
[07:47:33] <sportman> any of you guys using bxslider?
[07:47:48] <Woet> sorry, this: http://jsfiddle.net/xmE6R/1/
[07:48:03] <Woet> it sets the maximum but the minimum is overridden by the choice it seems
[07:48:32] <shoky> Woet: take another look at http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values
[07:48:40] <Woet> shoky: look at the second link
[07:48:48] <Woet> hm, wait a minute
[07:49:16] <shoky> oh didnt see theres another link
[07:49:39] <shoky> Woet: seems like the expected effect to me
[07:49:46] <Woet> yes, return false fixes it
[07:49:51] <Woet> weird - let me double check
[07:50:00] <Saaether> ya working fine here
[07:50:27] <shoky> by expected effect i meant that the handle you're currently dragging remains currently dragged
[07:52:26] <Woet> ok, nvm, my other code was messing up. thanks :)
[07:53:36] <PhanLord> jquery-ui drag n drop interface, is it possible to get source object ? and is it possible to return it back to its place ? (i just want to get some info from it and not the move whole thing)
[07:53:56] <shoky> yes
[07:53:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What would be the fastest way to get the first UL element inside a LI element?
[07:56:34] <shoky> .find('ul').eq(0) ?
[07:56:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Would that be faster than $(this).children('ul') ?
[07:57:10] <mvta> good evening mates (or morning)
[07:57:24] <EwokFartPorn> Morning.
[07:57:25] <shoky> .children('ul')  will only look for direct children. all you said was "inside"
[07:57:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right
[07:58:11] <shoky> but yes, generally .children('ul') is faster than .find('ul')
[07:58:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it has this structure: <li><a></a><div></div><ul>...</ul></li>
[07:58:42] <shoky> that's a direct child
[07:59:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok then best to use children?
[07:59:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> eh, that sounded wrong
[07:59:37] <shoky> heh
[07:59:44] <shoky> that's what i said, yeah
[08:00:39] <jedimind> they have laws against that, you know
[08:00:50] <mvta> does anybody know why $('input:checked').length returns 0 for me in IE8 ? the content was loaded by ajax and the checkbox are checked by default in the html. I'm working with 1.9.1 and migration 1.1.1
[08:05:49] <raddevon> Could anyone help me out with my script? I had it working with async off, but I want to refactor it to work with async. Hitting a few snags.
[08:08:04] <shoky> mvta: make a demo of the problem on jsbin.com
[08:08:14] <mvta> you need IE8
[08:08:18] <shoky> and?
[08:08:19] <mvta> do you have it?
[08:08:21] <mvta> oki
[08:08:25] <mvta> on second
[08:08:28] <mvta> one*
[08:10:45] <shoky> mvta: btw, it works fine in other browsers?
[08:12:04] <mvta> yeah
[08:12:11] <mvta> also works in jsbin
[08:12:25] <mvta> I think that the problem could be related with ajax
[08:13:33] <m_gol> mvta: you can append /show/light to jsfiddles
[08:13:44] <m_gol> and you'll get a pure site without all jsFiddle UI
[08:13:48] <m_gol> and without iframes
[08:14:09] <m_gol> I don't know about jsBin, I use jsFiddle
[08:14:18] <mvta> oki, one sec
[08:14:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have an element that toggles between "visibility:hidden" and "visibility:visible" - Is it possible to do a fade effect on the visibility property?
[08:14:56] <m_gol> mvta: examples: http://jsfiddle.net/m_gol/3hwjC/17 & http://jsfiddle.net/m_gol/3hwjC/17/show/light
[08:15:15] <m_gol> ecky-ptang-zoob: you have to animate opacity, you can't animate visibility
[08:15:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is that a good way to do it?
[08:15:32] <mvta> prefect, one sec
[08:16:46] <banttu> I have a <p class=someclass> that has a set of radio buttons and a select element. I need to clone them on clicking a provided link and append a counter on their name attributes.
[08:16:48] <brian___1> hi, if I target a select element, how do I append data after it? after() never targets anything but the select itself no matter how many times I chain it
[08:17:11] <jedimind> you cant target :before/:after pseudo elements
[08:17:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I guess better to use display?
[08:17:18] <shoky> brian___1: $('select').after('<div>')
[08:17:24] <brian___1> ahh nice
[08:17:35] <jedimind> i misunderstimated the question
[08:18:21] <shoky> nice word
[08:18:34] <shoky> bush style
[08:20:48] <mvta> m_gol IXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://jsfiddle.net/MqJvr/show/light/. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[08:23:06] <shoky> mvta: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Em2D4/   http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Em2D4/show/light/
[08:24:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why does this $(this).children("div.subnav").delay(1000).show(); not delay anything? It shows instantly
[08:24:53] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  .delay() only delays stuff that are queued like animations  .show() isn't queued
[08:25:12] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  .show(0)  is, on the other hand. afaik
[08:25:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you're right :)
[08:25:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> works
[08:26:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but the problem now is that if it's delayed and you hover really fast over the menu items, the submenus don't disappear if you move directly to another top level menu element
[08:28:42] <mvta> shoky, I saw
[08:28:44] <brian___1> shoky: so your trick worked but in the console if I do this: $('#id_of_select').after('<span class="x"></span>') it only targets the select
[08:28:50] <mvta> and it works for me
[08:28:54] <mvta> in Ie
[08:28:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> need some way to instantly delete all other subnavs before delaying and showing the current subnav
[08:28:58] <brian___1> so I can append data just fine but can't do anything to remove it
[08:29:11] <shoky> brian___1:  .after() is not supposed to select/target anything new. it just inserts stuff after , and returns the original
[08:29:33] <brian___1> so what is the best way to target an element that lives immediately after a select?
[08:29:41] <shoky> brian___1:  var span = $('<span class="x"></span>');  span.insertAfter('#whatever');   span.remove()
[08:29:54] <brian___1> hmm
[08:30:08] <is_null> hi all, what's the plugin to do this: http://demo.zeotheory.com/ztudio/portfolio ?
[08:30:39] <shoky> mvta: i know, it works for me too
[08:30:44] <momomomomo> brian___1: http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[08:30:51] <bytephilia> Had anybody successfully made infinitescroll plugin load sooner than default
[08:30:52] <bytephilia> ?
[08:30:54] <momomomomo> shoky: maybe point people to the docs, so that they can understand why things don't work
[08:30:57] <momomomomo> :)
[08:31:12] <brian___1> im on that page
[08:31:18] <brian___1> and went to it before coming here
[08:31:30] <rgb_> hi all
[08:31:32] <shoky> momomomomo: thanks for the advice
[08:31:35] <momomomomo> brian___1: Sure, but did you thoroughly read it?
[08:32:12] <rgb_> how could i get (the position of) the last element inside the body tag?
[08:33:12] <momomomomo> rgb_: see the link http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[08:34:14] <brian___1> pasting the same doc link to everyone with a question is not a good use of anyone's time, especially yours
[08:34:26] <momomomomo> They're both very basic questions on tree traversal brian___1
[08:34:35] <brian___1> to you
[08:34:47] <brian___1> to ppl coming here for help, the docs can be confusing, which is why they come here
[08:34:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shoky: mind looking at my code?
[08:35:12] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: post a fiddle here and everyone can look
[08:35:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[08:36:26] <momomomomo> brian___1: I'm a big fan of the 'teach a person to fish' concept. I could have pasted something like "$('body').children().last()" but that doesn't help him/her, does it?
[08:36:40] <raddevon> For some reason, it seems my fillHeadline function is not running after the AJAX call although I have it behind a promise object's success callback. Anyone know why? https://github.com/raddevon/onion-or-not/blob/true-ajax/js/js.js#L98

[08:38:06] <zeeflo> what can I do?
[08:39:04] <zeeflo> is it a jquery issue or is it a css thing?
[08:39:35] <raddevon> zeeflo: Are you talking about the green arrow button?
[08:39:43] <zeeflo> yes raddevon
[08:39:52] <zeeflo> ive spent hours trying to move into the nav bar
[08:40:08] <zeeflo> no matter what I try, the slide follows the button..
[08:40:18] <mvta> shoky I'm freaking out...
[08:41:51] <raddevon> zeeflo: It looks like more of a problem with the structure of your HTML. The element itself needs to be inside your <nav> element and inside the <div class="wrap"> inside of that.
[08:42:24] <zeeflo> raddevon: I tried that as well.. If I put the elements inside my <nav> the js doesnt load
[08:42:48] <zeeflo> i dont know if its because it gets outside the head
[08:42:52] <zeeflo> im kinda lost
[08:43:49] <raddevon> zeeflo: The script and the element shouldn't have to be in the same place. You should be able to place the two independently. Is the element being injected into the DOM by the script?
[08:43:53] <shoky> raddevon: your refreshContent method is kinda off..  why aren't the 'complete' and 'error'  triggers wrapped in a function? you're calling them right away
[08:44:12] <shoky> raddevon: also it seems you're using 'this' rather frivolously
[08:44:21] <raddevon> shoky: Probably just because I don't know what I'm doing. ;-)
[08:44:36] <shoky> ;p
[08:44:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> here is my fiddle: hover really fast over the menu items and it becomes a mess
[08:44:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/3/
[08:45:09] <zeeflo> raddevon: I tried taking the flip class and put it in my nav bar after the search tool.. If I move my #flip out the head, the #topbar doesnt get loaded
[08:45:14] <raddevon> shoky: So, wrap those callbacks with function() {} to cause them to delay until the actual callback occurs?
[08:45:20] <zeeflo> im baffled
[08:45:47] <shoky> raddevon: yeah, you're already doing it for 'beforeSend'... but i don't think that'll be enough
[08:45:51] <zeeflo> so for some reason, i cant move them independently
[08:46:14] <raddevon> zeeflo: The topbar doesn't exist in the document at all if you move flip?
[08:46:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when you hover slow, no problem...
[08:46:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> on fast hovering, problems
[08:46:43] <zeeflo> raddevon: no
[08:46:57] <zeeflo> I can show you?
[08:47:00] <raddevon> shoky: Thanks for the help. I will get to refactoring!
[08:47:06] <raddevon> zeeflo: Sure
[08:47:12] <shoky> raddevon: also on the bottom.. it seems you're doing $(headlines).on(...   before headlines is even defined
[08:47:35] <raddevon> shoky: Ah. Nice catch there as well.
[08:47:50] <zeeflo> raddevon: http://ml.devgru.dk/
[08:48:02] <raddevon> shoky: I'm really out of my element when it comes to async programming. Haven't yet been able to wrap my head around it, but I'm learning.
[08:48:46] <lumax-web> Hi guys, can somebody point me in the right direction? - I write a CakePHP based mysql importer and want match array/ JSON object keys to the sql table keys the app have
[08:49:42] <lumax-web> its a csv/ txt importer and works fine, but the dynamic matching magic is now on the list
[08:49:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I think you need to go to #mysql for that
[08:50:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> or ##php
[08:50:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shoky: had a chance to take a look at the fiddle?
[08:50:56] <lumax-web> öhm... I dont think so because I have a JSON object already with the data, and now I want to match the fields with jquery but dont want to reinvent the wheel, wehn there is a code maby on github
[08:51:58] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: sorry didnt notice it. i'll take a look after i eat smth
[08:52:00] <NoiseEee> lumax-web: break it down. what exactly are you stuck on?
[08:52:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[08:52:27] <raddevon> zeeflo: Where is the script that runs this sliding animation?
[08:52:42] <raddevon> zeeflo: Is it in a separate file, or is it inline in the HTML?
[08:52:52] <zeeflo> the js?
[08:52:55] <zeeflo> its in a file
[08:53:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Actually when I do hide(0) it goes much smoother... isn't hide instantly anyway?
[08:53:08] <zeeflo> its in /js/animation.js
[08:53:11] <lumax-web> I look after a tutorial or maby code which let match a Json object with a standard one and then send the new object via AJAX to a controller
[08:53:13] <raddevon> zeeflo: Thanks.
[08:53:23] <zeeflo> more specifically
[08:53:38] <NoiseEee> lumax-web: define "match a Json object with a standard one and then send the new object via AJAX to a controller"
[08:53:42] <zeeflo> its in /wp-content/themes/videoplus/js/animation.js
[08:55:05] <raddevon> zeeflo: I'm going to play with it for a second and see what I can find out.
[08:55:13] <lumax-web> assign JSON object Keys with drag and drop or something like jquery UI
[08:55:38] <NoiseEee> lumax-web: can't really help you until you stop speaking in generic vague terms
[08:56:08] <lumax-web> sorry, thats my technical english I am not a native speaker
[08:57:09] <lumax-web> I look after a AJAX importer UI like podio.com do it
[08:58:13] <flexd> So uh, I am using jquery-datatables, and I am trying to use fnReloadAjax()
[08:58:16] <fr4zzle> hi
[08:58:26] <flexd> but somehow that does not exist? I'm using the latest nightly
[08:58:36] <fr4zzle> has anyone here used the youtube api?
[08:58:47] <fr4zzle> im trying to figure out how to play/pause a video through js
[08:59:00] <zeeflo> raddevon: of course
[08:59:11] <lumax-web> flexd that sounds good
[08:59:55] <flexd> lumax-web: hm?
[09:00:19] <lumax-web> datatables looks good
[09:00:30] <flexd> I just started using it
[09:00:31] <lumax-web> exactly what I was looking for
[09:00:38] <flexd> and it has a million oddly named options
[09:00:55] <lumax-web> drag & drop data feeds based on JSON objects
[09:01:55] <aphpperson> I have been building a slider that scrolls my images left to right in li's.  After a li is shown / scrolls off it is added to the beginning / end of the list depending on which direction it went out.  But now I have tons more items.  I want to display an assortment of items across multiple rows.. but I only want each item to be displayed once at a time.  Any ideas on how I could achieve this?
[09:02:33] <aphpperson> so like if item 7 is being shown in row #1 it can't be shown in any of the other rows
[09:08:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a symbol opposite to ^ ? just pointing down but also on top
[09:11:51] <Dewin[work]>  v  ?
[09:12:09] <Dewin[work]> or I can learn to read.
[09:12:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah but he is too big and doesn't float in air
[09:12:46] <Dewin[work]> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/338667/is-there-an-upside-down-caret-character
[09:12:48] <Dewin[work]> Enjoy :)
[09:13:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :o
[09:13:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> kewl
[09:13:03] <jshultz> does anyone know why, using jquerytools on mobile, when i scroll it will pass 2 items, then 1, then 2 items.
[09:13:29] <Dewin[work]> I suspect you're even doing the same thing as the OP
[09:13:37] <Dewin[work]> either that or showing folded/unfolded states
[09:13:55] <whitenoise> if there is a jquery plugin generating JS fileswhat is the best way to figure out what code is generating those files?
[09:15:08] * sportman waves
[09:20:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does $(".nav ul > li") effect all <li> elements in <ul> ?
[09:24:02] <TheCowboy> ecky--ptang-zoob, maybe not, only direct children
[09:24:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> all direct children?
[09:24:46] <TheCowboy> you might have a nested ul list in an li with the sublist items being ignored
[09:24:52] <TheCowboy> what are you trying to do?
[09:25:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/3/
[09:25:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $(".nav ul li.hover") that i want to change to $(".nav ul > li").
[09:28:15] <TheCowboy> ecky--ptang-zoob, i mean in english what do you want to do
[09:28:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> have more efficient jquery selectors
[09:30:00] <TheCowboy> ecky--ptang-zoob, but you want the behavior to remain the same?
[09:30:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> indeed
[09:30:21] <Xeon06> Does anyone know why sortable's connectWith won't work unless both lists have the same width? Is that a feature? http://jsfiddle.net/Pv497/
[09:33:02] <TheCowboy> ecky--ptang-zoob, one improvement can be using .nav li.hover
[09:33:16] <TheCowboy> but you might be able to use pure css for what you're trying to accomplish as well
[09:34:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> urd
[09:34:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[09:36:06] <msafi> I have <div id="foo"><img src="1.jpg" /></div>. The image inside gets replaced with Ajax and $.html(). But how can I fade the new image into the old one?
[09:37:00] <msafi> I have an ajax call firing every 10 seconds to replace the image.
[09:37:20] <msafi> But since the old image gets removed, I'm not sure how to fade one into the other.
[09:37:35] <msafi> The problem is, I can only have one image at a time inside <div id="foo">
[09:51:36] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: still need me to look at that fiddle?
[09:52:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if you have a sec
[09:52:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/3/
[09:53:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hover really fast over the menu items
[09:57:31] <shoky> k
[09:57:37] <shoky> Xeon06: you need tolerance: 'pointer'
[09:58:34] <Xeon06> shoky: Amazing! Thank you!
[10:00:01] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: a quick fix is using .stop(true) to stop and clear the queue  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vcft6/7/
[10:00:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ahh
[10:00:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> also best fix?
[10:01:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> a different problem: http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/10/
[10:01:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the main menu items should turn yellow on hover
[10:01:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but the submenu items should stay #000 when hovered
[10:01:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but they also turn yellow!
[10:02:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and i did ul > li
[10:04:08] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  you have invalid css.. forgot a closing }  for .subnav
[10:04:57] <lx4r> Hello everyone
[10:05:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh yes, thx
[10:05:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but not fixing the problem
[10:05:35] <shoky> oh you mean the link in #1?
[10:06:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/11/ this one
[10:06:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hover over the item in the first submenu, it turns yellow, but it shouldn't
[10:06:51] <shoky> it still matches the selector:  .nav ul > li a:hover
[10:07:07] <shoky> it's an <a>  that's a descendant of  .nav ul > li
[10:07:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[10:07:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so .nav > ul li a:hover then?
[10:07:48] <shoky> uhm
[10:08:14] <lx4r> I want to build a jQuery Mobile app which shows an RSS feed. The first thing I found on the net for this task was jFeed. Is this the best solution (problem: The jQuery version jFeed needs does not ork with jQuery Mobile)?
[10:08:25] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  .nav ul > li > a:hover  i guess
[10:09:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then nothing changes color anymore - http://jsfiddle.net/vcft6/13/
[10:10:06] <c4ptnh00k> Can someone let me know why this is not displaying the validation error? http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/gqr4b/
[10:10:30] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: you didn't put what i said
[10:10:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It sounds correct though, direct children li elements from ul and then the direct a elements from the li
[10:11:20] <Saaether> c4ptnh00k : Cannot call method 'showErrors' of undefined

[10:12:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you're smart :)
[10:12:03] <c4ptnh00k> so why is it undefined
[10:12:51] <rgb_> momomomomo: well i better should have written what i already tried. basically i was close to it. the missing part was children(), as an alternative children(':last-child') works, too
[10:12:59] <rgb_> thanks so far
[10:14:15] <Saaether> c4ptnh00k your callintg $("#btn1").validate but there is no such element #btn1 on your page
[10:14:36] <Saaether> c4ptnh00k http://jsfiddle.net/gqr4b/1/ updated
[10:14:51] <rgb_> is there a benfit of using $('body').children(':last-child'); vs $('body').children().last();?
[10:15:14] <c4ptnh00k> Saaether: ugh you were right ty just rushing i guess
[10:16:06] <shoky> rgb_: no, afaik
[10:16:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> of course IE7 breaks my menu
[10:17:02] <rgb_> shoky, ok fine then :)
[10:17:30] <Trudko> Hi guys is there jquery UI compatible with  1.4.4 version?
[10:17:45] <Trudko> 1.9.2 is labeled as legacy
[10:20:00] <shoky> Trudko: it's labeled as legacy but it's still too new for jquery 1.4.4   i guess you want jquery-ui 1.8.x
[10:20:54] <Trudko> shoky: last I can find is 1.9 http://jqueryui.com/download/all/
[10:21:06] <Trudko> nevermind
[10:21:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shoky, do you bother to add fixed for IE 6 and 7 ?
[10:21:25] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: fixed?
[10:21:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> fixes*
[10:22:10] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: depends if the client needs to support them
[10:22:42] <c4ptnh00k>  this will only display the validation message after typing into first tb then hitting backspace. It should happen when clicking save. can anyone tell me why? http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/gqr4b/2/
[10:22:48] <shoky> my preference is not to ;]
[10:23:22] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: if i were making something of my own, i definitely wouldn't bother
[10:28:22] <c4ptnh00k> Any Ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/gqr4b/2/
[10:30:44] <nsanden> what could cause all my twitter bootstrap icons to turn into glyph [] looking characters?
[10:35:02] <pachet> that's the curse of the glyph
[10:36:00] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gqr4b/3/
[10:38:10] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: Thank You. So I must define the validation rules then the valid() checks to see if it matches a rule?
[10:38:38] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: usually it'd be done like this.. with a submit button  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gqr4b/4/
[10:39:10] <c4ptnh00k> IM trying to actually validate without submitting

[10:40:26] <dabar> I've got an onload function, and inside it I do jQuery( document )…. several times. Is it a significant optimization to var $doc = jQuery( document ); then use $doc wherever I use jQuery( document ) now?
[10:40:34] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: Awesome! you da man
[10:47:01] <DeltaHeavy> Is having one line functions in your JS like this considered bad practice? return $.extend(true, {}, obj);
[10:47:47] <NetersLandreau> hi folks. i'm populating some values from google geocoder but i think i'm checking the values too quickly, if i put a break in my script after populating and manually check, i get the expected results, but if i don't use a break, console.log() shows the value to still be empty.. how can i force my script to slow down a bit before checking the value?
[10:47:49] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: nope
[10:47:55] <DeltaHeavy> Awesome
[10:48:33] <raddevon> shoky: I did those refactors on my code, but I'm still out of sync somewhere. Would you care to check it out again? https://github.com/raddevon/onion-or-not/blob/true-ajax/js/js.js
[10:49:22] <fr4zzle> when using slide() is it possible to set a target height?
[10:49:40] <raddevon> shoky: It's still trying to run fillHeadline before the headlines object properties are populated.
[10:50:11] <fr4zzle> if i set height in css, the slide doesnt work, and with no height, the slide just slides the element to the size of the content its holding
[10:50:35] <fr4zzle> id like it to slide to a specific height
[10:50:50] <raddevon> fr4zzle: Maybe instead of slide you could use animate and animate the height property to the height you want.
[10:51:06] <fr4zzle> ah ok thanks
[10:51:32] <raddevon> fr4zzle: No problem
[10:51:51] <raddevon> fr4zzle: Here's the documentation if that helps: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:51:56] <shoky> raddevon:  listObject.fillFromJSON.bind(listObject);    doesn't do anything, just returns a function
[10:52:19] <fr4zzle> yeah im already looking at it:)
[10:52:19] <raddevon> shoky: Oh, right. Forgot to take that out when I refactored.
[10:52:23] <shoky> raddevon: i think you meant:  success: listObject.fillFromJSON.bind(listObject);
[10:52:27] <fr4zzle> hmm, it keeps elements hidden
[10:52:32] <shoky> er without the ;
[10:53:08] <shoky> raddevon:  well or just  function() { listObject.fillFromJSON(); }
[10:53:22] <raddevon> shoky: Right. I'll change it over to that.
[10:53:59] <shoky> raddevon: uhmm actually you probably want  function(data) { listObject.fillFromJSON(data); }     or just the .bind  with no function(){}
[10:54:34] <raddevon> shoky: Looking at it now...
[10:56:08] <raddevon> shoky: That will pass through the data resulting from the successful AJAX call, right? I want to be sure I understand.
[10:56:25] <shoky> raddevon: yeah

[11:00:04] <shoky> raddevon: donno if you want those $(headlines).on() calls inside the fillHeadline function, if you're gonna be calling that more than once
[11:00:30] <raddevon> shoky: Good thinking. I don't. Let me think about a better location for them.
[11:00:48] <raddevon> shoky: That got my loading spinner working (Hurray!), but I'm still somehow putting the cart before the horse when I'm trying to add the headline to the page. That is happening before the headline object is instantiated. It's throwing a TypeError on line 120 as a result.
[11:01:20] <raddevon> Oh, actually, I had moved those out but forgot to push. I now have the bindings just after headlines is defined.
[11:01:39] <Drumer306> so I'm loading the content of a page via ajax, which contains a jquery.flexslider slide show,  is it possible to keep the jquery code on that content which will load after the ajax call automatically ?  Or do i need to put that in my callback function ?
[11:01:47] <shoky> raddevon: for more help you should post a demo/live link.. it's not fun to look at the code and guess what it's doing for you
[11:02:08] <raddevon> OK. Sorry about that. Let me pull something together.

[11:11:29] <aznman> ??
[11:12:02] <skypce> engaged: you can  use first-child or nth for specific li with :hover
[11:12:55] <skypce> engaged http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/

[11:47:44] <j_wolf> quick question about .val() and autocomplete...I have a script that, on blur, catches the value of the email input, and send it to another function to test if it's a valid email. Problem is...when you use the autocomplete feature (or autofill) it only captures what is typed...not the full input
[11:48:18] <NoiseEee> don't capture the input value, capture the matching/chosen item.
[11:48:45] <j_wolf> NoiseEee: how is that accomplished?
[11:49:00] <NoiseEee> j_wolf: well there's an event when they choose something from the autocomplete, right?  do it there.
[11:49:44] <shoky> aznman: seems fine here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cxLNm/   are you sure your fragment wasn't already appended somewhere?
[11:50:05] <j_wolf> NoiseEee: hmm...s'alight. thanks. I'll look into it
[11:50:28] <Siecje> How can I check all the check boxes in a div?
[11:51:12] <shoky> Siecje: $('div').find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true)
[11:52:02] <Siecje> shoky: can I put that inside a javascript function?
[11:52:29] <oleyb> Siecje: yes, thats where it belongs
[11:52:30] <shoky> Siecje: wha? yes..
[11:53:13] <oleyb> make sure you are selecting the correct div as well
[11:53:32] <oleyb> if the id of your div was "checkbox-container"
[11:53:49] <oleyb> then you'd do something like: $('#checkbox-container').find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true)
[11:54:09] <oleyb> "#" is used to select based on IDs
[11:54:18] <oleyb> a period is used to select by class name
[11:55:06] <Siecje> http://dpaste.org/0q7my/
[11:55:52] <Siecje> so I have a checkbox with an id "i1" and I want it to click all the checkboxes in the div "1"
[11:56:33] <oleyb> ids should be descriptive of the element
[11:56:49] <oleyb> numbers arent particularly well suited to that
[11:56:55] <Siecje> so in the line before the onClickHandler I put $('#1').find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true)
[11:56:57] <oleyb> but thats another issue
[11:57:09] <Siecje> oleyb: true but they are the ids of node in the tree
[11:57:29] <Siecje> so div 1 contains all children of id=1
[11:57:46] <raddevon> shoky: OK. Had to wrestle with some git branches before I could get a live copy up. Sorry about that. http://raddevon.github.io/onion-or-not/
[11:57:57] <Siecje> but how do I get the id of the checkbox and remove the i
[11:58:02] <oleyb> $('#1').find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true) should be the content of the onlickhandler method
[11:59:48] <Siecje> also will it expand the divs when I call that jquery  code
[11:59:59] <raddevon> shoky: Just ignore the problems with the background images not loading.
[12:00:14] <raddevon> shoky: Also, thank you very much for your help.
[12:00:47] <oleyb> what do you mean by expand?
[12:00:54] <aznman> @shoky... i'll check. it's not supposed to be. Thanks for the demo.
[12:01:02] <shoky> raddevon: well, headline is not defined yet by the time you trigger that ajaxSuccess event
[12:01:03] <benoitlemyre> First day
[12:01:34] <shoky> raddevon: actually
[12:01:37] <Siecje> http://dpaste.org/wd0Uy/ so the divs stopped expanding so I can't tell if it is working
[12:01:49] <shoky> raddevon: you're never defining headline at all
[12:02:01] <shoky> raddevon: getRandom doesn't return anything
[12:03:00] <oleyb> Siecje, the jquery method requires a string
[12:03:05] <raddevon> shoky: I see. My return is actually returning from the done callback function. How can I return that value from the getRandom function after the AJAX call?
[12:03:17] <oleyb> $('#' + id).find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true);
[12:03:21] <shoky> raddevon: you can't
[12:03:27] <oleyb> that probably isnt the best way but it should work
[12:03:36] <raddevon> shoky: Yikes. What are my options?
[12:04:06] <oleyb> depends on what the id param in the method is
[12:04:27] <Siecje> oleyb: I just used div since I already have  div = document.getElementById(id);
[12:05:06] <oleyb> right but the jquery line in the code you posted has a syntax error
[12:05:18] <Siecje> well there is a problem now to expand a node I have to deselect it and then select it again hmm I don't know what I want now
[12:05:25] <oleyb> #id isn't a valid parameter, it needs to be a string
[12:05:33] <Siecje> $(div).find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true);
[12:05:41] <Siecje> oh ok
[12:05:42] <Siecje> ty
[12:05:43] <raddevon> shoky: I feel like I must be thinking about this the wrong way on a very fundamental level, but I'm not sure how to correct.
[12:05:53] <oleyb> ok I think that should work
[12:05:56] <shoky> raddevon: you can return the promise itself and call .done() on the returned value, for example.  i don't really know what you wanna do yet generally in this page
[12:05:58] <oleyb> is it checking the checkboxes?
[12:06:06] <Siecje> yeah but not expanding the divs
[12:06:32] <Siecje> I just want a hierartical checkbox form lol
[12:06:37] <Siecje> why is this so difficult
[12:07:02] <Siecje> it expands one level but not more which is probably fine
[12:07:09] <Siecje> just need to figure out how to make it intuitive
[12:07:09] <oleyb> it's only difficult because you haven't learned the tools to do it fully yet :P
[12:07:28] <Siecje> oleyb: I would there would be a ready made solution
[12:07:51] <oleyb> the web is a blank canvas
[12:07:59] <oleyb> I'm sure there is some widget somewhere out there that does it
[12:08:13] <raddevon> shoky: Does that allow me to get to a value returned inside the promise object?
[12:08:32] <Siecje> oleyb: http://dpaste.org/oaWh6/ just so you can laugh at how I am creating the html of the form
[12:09:08] <raddevon> shoky: All I need this method to do is to return a headline object, but I have to make sure the AJAX call is complete before I have one to return. I'm probably explaining to you exactly what you already know. :-)
[12:09:09] <shoky> raddevon: with async stuff you need to forget about returning things. you do stuff in the callbacks
[12:09:19] <oleyb> Siecje: oh, that explains some of your approach then haha
[12:09:19] <DeltaHeavy> Siecje: mk_indent makes me want to hurt you @_@
[12:09:42] <hXm> i have this http://pastebin.com/0gXCi2QK and the result is "undefined" but the real response is {result:400}
[12:09:42] <shoky> raddevon: you make sure the ajax call is complete by calling .done() on it and putting your code in the callback
[12:10:33] <Siecje> DeltaHeavy: suggestion?
[12:10:39] <DeltaHeavy> Siecje: CSS
[12:10:44] <DeltaHeavy> margin-left
[12:10:50] <jedimind> or text-indent
[12:10:52] <DeltaHeavy> <blockquote> if appropriate.
[12:11:03] <raddevon> shoky: OK. Let me mull that over for a bit. I may be back to ask more questions if you don't mind. You've been a huge help!
[12:11:26] <Siecje> would inline CSS be better/
[12:11:31] <Siecje> the problem is it is dynamic
[12:11:55] <Siecje> and I don't know how to store the level to pass it to my template
[12:11:57] <DeltaHeavy> Siecje: No, use an external stylesheet.
[12:12:19] <Siecje> how do I show all divs that are inside a div
[12:12:19] <Siecje>   p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }  $(div).find(':div').prop('display', "block");
[12:12:22] <shoky> raddevon: you did that fillFromJSON which fills your 'list' field
[12:12:36] <raddevon> shoky: Yes
[12:12:37] <Siecje> $(div).find(':div').prop('display', "block");
[12:12:46] <shoky> raddevon: so, in fillHeadline, you need to access that list. not 'headline' which is undefined
[12:13:52] <shoky> raddevon: i guess that's confusing, nevermind,
[12:13:56] <raddevon> shoky: OK. It's going to take me a minute to get there, but I'm thinking on it.
[12:15:32] <Saaether> Siecje :div is not a valid pseudo selector
[12:15:41] <Saaether> .find('div')
[12:16:00] <Saaether> and if you just want to make them visible you can use .show()
[12:16:18] <Siecje> Saaether: that is only expanding one div for somereason
[12:16:35] <Siecje> or is it because the other div is inside another div
[12:17:02] <Saaether> did you already post sample code? i just started paying attention heh
[12:17:42] <benoitlemyre> did somebody know the difference between livequery() and on()
[12:18:57] <Saaether> they killed off livequery in 1.4
[12:20:29] <raddevon> shoky: So, pulling the return for getRandom out of the promise done callback and putting it below that won't do anything for me, right?
[12:20:54] <shoky> raddevon: maybe you could use something like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/g8R5a/
[12:21:22] <shoky> raddevon: notice those are 3 seperate parts, i just put em together
[12:21:40] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around per chance?
[12:22:28] <Siecje> Saaether: http://dpaste.org/BdftO/
[12:22:36] <shoky> raddevon:  this part: headlines.getRandom(true).done(fillHeadline);    should go in function newHeadline() {..
[12:23:00] <shoky> raddevon: and notice the headline argument i added to fillHeadline
[12:24:01] <shoky> raddevon: and yeah, pulling the return out definitely won't help ;P
[12:24:02] <raddevon> shoky: Rather than creating an object, you're just passing in the result of getRandom to fillHeadline.
[12:24:45] <Saaether> Siecje http://jsfiddle.net/d5Guc/ is this what you want it to do?
[12:24:50] <rgb_> is there a shorter way of expressing the following? $body.children().not("script").last().position().top;
[12:25:06] <shoky> raddevon:  getRandom returns a piped promise, i pipe it so that i can set the "resolved" value, i.e. the argument that will be sent to .done() calls on that piped promise
[12:25:20] <jeffsmykil> Anyone have any qUnit experience?
[12:25:41] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Ask away
[12:25:53] <Siecje> Saaether: mostly, I am trying to get it to expand more than one level so Product->Linux should expand furthur to be Product -> Linux -> Common etc
[12:25:59] <Saaether> ya sorry forgot to save
[12:25:59] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/d5Guc/1/
[12:26:28] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: I have this one test that fails and it shows exected, but it doesn't show actual or the difference and I was wondering if you ran into anything similar
[12:26:32] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: QUnit has experience with me, so I should know.
[12:26:37] <raddevon> shoky: pipe allows you to get the value the function returns?
[12:26:58] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Can you reproduce the issue on jsfiddle.net?
[12:27:34] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/Rhzak/
[12:27:43] <Siecje> yes Saaether thank you
[12:27:44] <shoky> raddevon: yes, if i get you right. it takes whatever you returned from the .pipe() and creates a new deferred on the fly that's resolved with what you returned
[12:28:13] <Siecje> Saaether: did you just change it to .show() I had that and it wasn't working
[12:28:21] <Saaether> yup, thats all i did
[12:28:27] <hXm> what is the correct way to parse json data?
[12:28:30] <shoky> raddevon: at least in this usage of .pipe  (which btw is deprecated and renamed to .then in current versions. but .pipe is so much more descriptive a name that i keep to it for now)
[12:28:38] <hXm> and what is the correct way to use ajax, .done or success?
[12:29:45] <shoky> hXm: they're both correct. and.. $.parseJSON works for json
[12:29:58] <hXm> but one of them is not going to be deprecated?
[12:30:03] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: I can try.  You have experience with this?
[12:30:20] <jeffsmykil> with qUnit, or am I going to put it in a fiddle and then you will have no clue
[12:30:49] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I am a contributor to the QUnit project, if you show me the problem I'll have a clue. maybe a solution too
[12:31:00] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: hot thank you
[12:31:05] <raddevon> shoky: Sorry. I'm having trouble with the way this flows. Is it that pipe, once resolved, passes the return onto the next method in the chain? So, in this case, it passes the return onto the done callback.
[12:31:16] <shoky> hXm: the only thing that's deprecated is calling .success(...)   but using the 'success' option of .ajax isn't deprecated
[12:31:18] <sanguisdex> so I am on my 3rd page google search results and no close to finding what I think is a simple solution. how do I trigger a pdf download when some one hits submit. or start the download on the thank you page
[12:31:32] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle I can also PM you the actual code
[12:31:40] <hXm> ah, ah
[12:31:55] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I prefer in public. Just paste it on the http://jsfiddle.net/Rhzak/ and make sure the problem is visible, save it and post the link
[12:32:05] <shoky> raddevon:  i think you got it right
[12:32:07] <jeffsmykil> yeah ill make a fiddle
[12:32:17] <jeffsmykil> i cant put everything in it for nda issues
[12:33:04] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I assume we're solving a technical problem, so abstract it to a bare minimum.
[12:33:10] <raddevon> shoky: Cool. I'm thinking of a slight modification of this. What if I were to write an anonymouse function into the done callback. How would I pass that same value that was returned from the pipe?
[12:33:12] <jeffsmykil> yeah im going to
[12:33:17] <Krinkle> great :)
[12:33:41] <raddevon> shoky: How would I access that value in the anon function rather
[12:34:19] <Schonert> Working on a project, where they are seeking a scroll effect simular to the https://www.spotify.com/dk/ background images. Any suggestions on libraries ? appreciated
[12:34:21] <shoky> raddevon: not sure what you mean
[12:34:53] <jedimind> Schonert that's a 404 ?
[12:35:02] <jedimind> but assuming you're talking about parallax background effects?
[12:35:29] <shoky> raddevon:  oh umm. i gues you mean:  .done(function(headline) { ... })    ?
[12:35:50] <Schonert> jedimind wired, are they blocking people out, if they are from the wrong location? Correct assumed
[12:36:04] <raddevon> shoky: Yeah, I think that's what I need.
[12:36:16] <raddevon> shoky: I'm going to fork this and get your take on it.
[12:36:17] <jedimind> Schonert http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[12:36:26] <jedimind> http://www.impressivewebs.com/parallax-scrolling-scripts-plugins/
[12:36:33] <Schonert> jedimind just you putting a name, helped c!:-) Thanks
[12:36:33] <jedimind> parallax library is what you're looking for
[12:36:37] <shoky> raddevon: a'ight
[12:36:39] <jedimind> :)
[12:37:05] <Krinkle> !fiddle-qunit
[12:37:05] <b-ot> Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/Rhzak/
[12:37:55] <jedimind> oh fancy, didnt know jsfiddle had qunit built in
[12:38:01] <jedimind> that's the bomb-deezy
[12:38:32] <Schonert> jedimind theres a ton of them.. any one you've got experience with, and would recommend?
[12:38:50] <jedimind> ive used scrollorama personally a few times
[12:39:00] <jedimind> but you should do some research yourself depending on what you need exactly
[12:39:11] <jedimind> they're all more or less the same thing, some offer more and some offer less options
[12:39:19] <jedimind> if you just need something basic, get a barebones one
[12:40:09] <Schonert> razorfish's parallax seems like a fit.. I'll look around. thanks for the push
[12:40:53] <Krinkle> jedimind: It doesn't have qunit built in (not that I know of anyway)
[12:41:08] <Krinkle> I created a fiddle with code.jquery.com qunit.js,css in external resources
[12:41:51] <jedimind> yeah i realized that after i said it
[12:41:58] <jedimind> im mildly retarded, dont make fun
[12:43:16] <shoky> you made up for it with "bomb-deezy"
[12:43:39] <raddevon> shoky: I need to compare some of the headline object's other properties later after the user has given their response. So, I need access to the current headline after it has been filled on the page. How about this method for doing that? Check out starting at line 19: http://jsfiddle.net/raddevon/7XBbe/1/
[12:44:36] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: you still here or did the net split take you out
[12:44:42] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Still here
[12:44:45] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/Rhzak/2/
[12:45:01] <shoky> raddevon: not nice, that'll take you back to try doing stuff not-in-callbacks
[12:46:23] <shoky> raddevon: but i dont really know the best advice to give you, cause i donno what the full page is supposed to be showing and how the user interacts with it
[12:46:43] <hXm> i have this: http://pastebin.com/rCCz3LPv and the alert is 'undefined',but the response is {"result":"400"}
[12:46:45] <hXm> what do i wrong?
[12:47:56] <raddevon> shoky: It's fairly simple. It will show a headline. The user will guess whether the headline is an Onion headline or a real headline. That's when I'm comparing their answer against the data in the headline object. Then, it's going to show them a link to the source and they can load the next headline onto the page.
[12:48:19] <raddevon> shoky: The source link is also going to come from the object.
[12:49:17] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: The diff has no good way to display it but the problem is in the fact that the inheritance does not match
[12:49:34] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: you're comparing an instance of a private constructor to a plain object
[12:49:51] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: this one passes: http://jsfiddle.net/32Jvy/
[12:50:31] <jeffsmykil> my actual code uses a private constructor hrm
[12:50:55] <jeffsmykil> can I change the expect to make it match/
[12:51:20] <shoky> raddevon:  well.. as long as you call it 'currentHeadline' so it'll be clear, and you check if its defined before accessing it.. you should be ok i suppose
[12:51:20] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Though I realise this is only a small snippet, I find the use of a constructor for a simple object like that a bit odd, especially considering the constructor function is uncomparable
[12:51:43] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I mean, an instanceof check will always return false because the constructor function is re-created for each invocation of createTag
[12:51:58] <raddevon> shoky: Using the method in that fork I sent you?
[12:52:10] <Krinkle> so createTag('foo').value.constuctor !== createTag('bar').value.constuctor
[12:52:28] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: You can use propEqual if you don't want it to compare the inheritance
[12:52:34] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: instead of deepEqual
[12:52:47] <raddevon> shoky: Just had a panic when I re-read your reply. How do I need to check it it's defined, and what do I do if it isn't?
[12:52:50] <jeffsmykil> oh that would work
[12:52:58] <jeffsmykil> i dont care about the inheritence i dont think
[12:53:03] <raddevon> shoky: So sorry for my ignorance.
[12:53:12] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/vemeg/
[12:53:49] <jeffsmykil> krinkle that still tests the values in the object right?
[12:54:09] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: May I point out that a constructor with that many arguments seems like a bad idea in general. if its not too late, I'd recommend (unrelated to the tests) to reconsider that and perhaps have it take an object as single parameter
[12:54:26] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Yes it will still be recursive, it just won't compare inherited properties
[12:54:28] <shoky> raddevon: heh i said that thing about checking for defined because the original problem was that you were getting an error because it was undefined ;p  if (currentHeadline) { .. }  is fine for checking
[12:55:25] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle you mean pass createTag an object?
[12:55:50] <shoky> raddevon: and.. if it's all written properly, it'll be defined when it needs to be so you dont really need the check.. so maybe you can disregard that ;p
[12:56:01] <raddevon> shoky: Alright. I think I've got it. Thank you so much for your help.
[12:56:09] <c4ptnh00k> Array(16).join('wat' - 1) + ' Batman'
[12:58:00] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/vemeg/1/
[12:58:12] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: That shows how propEqual/deepEqual differ
[12:58:55] <jeffsmykil> thank you
[12:59:18] <jeffsmykil> Were you suggesting I pass the constructor an object?
[12:59:40] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: yes
[12:59:52] <jeffsmykil> can I ask an ignmorant question then?
[13:00:17] <jeffsmykil> if the constructor is creating an object, whats the point of passing it an object, you have already created the object
[13:00:18] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Or perhaps, if you're only storing key/value pairs in createTag and no functions methods, avoid the createFunction alltogether
[13:00:26] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: My point exactly
[13:01:03] <jeffsmykil> so you are saying just get rid of the constructor and make an object the 'normal' way
[13:01:20] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: javascript has object literals, they're a powerful tool. From other languages you might feel the need for a constructor but sometimes it simply isn't needed in this language
[13:02:47] <Krinkle> Unless you need things like var foo = createTag( ... ); foo.someMethod( bar ); (e.g. more than just data, also interactive methods), then a plain object is likely going to do great for you
[13:03:32] <jeffsmykil> im still learning the object oriented stuff i might be overdoing it the way you do sometimes when you first learn something
[13:04:54] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: You've come to the right place :)
[13:05:10] <jeffsmykil> LOL Ive been here a long time :/
[13:05:33] <jedimind> and you still havent learned oo ?
[13:05:45] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I usually only idle in this channel, so I wouldn't know who is where how long
[13:05:53] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: btw, shameless plug for a list I maintain: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Learning_JavaScript
[13:06:02] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[13:06:12] <Krinkle> don't be fooled by the "Learning" part, most of it is for advanced developers who know the basics already
[13:06:24] <jeffsmykil> jedimind: with object constructors and stuff yup thanks for making me feel stupid !
[13:06:38] <jedimind> oh can i shamelessly plug things too?

[13:09:14] <jeffsmykil> jedimind: your domain name has an interesting double entendre
[13:09:29] <jedimind> pud ?
[13:09:38] <jedimind> or style dui
[13:09:42] <jedimind> styled ui
[13:09:45] <jeffsmykil> yes style dui
[13:11:49] <jeffsmykil> thank you for your help jedimind
[13:12:52] <jeffsmykil> I mean Krinkle thank you for your help Krinkle
[13:12:59] <jeffsmykil> thank you for your confidence crushing jedimind
[13:13:12] <Krinkle> hehe, you're welcome :)
[13:17:53] <jedimind> jeffsmykil thats why im here :)
[13:18:51] <myosotis> I have 2 separate functions that get called on a dom event. They get called in the wrong order. can I explicitly control the order, or do I need to do something other than rely on execution order?
[13:19:39] <eddiemonge> myosotis: why not call one from the other?
[13:19:42] <myosotis> they are being set by 2 seperate calls like this: jQuery(element).on('click', function() {});
[13:20:13] <myosotis> one is generic, and included as part of the library, the second is added by another js file that should occur after the first one
[13:25:01] <sunya7a> Good day guys...I'm using the JQuery UI .tabs method and have it set up as in the example with content via Ajax. My question is .. can I attach a before load call to this? I would like to run some js that may warn me if I have unsaved data on my tab for example
[13:27:18] <eddiemonge> sunya7a: beforeActivate
[13:31:31] <sunya7a> eddiemonge: thank you
[13:34:21] <Siecje> http://jsfiddle.net/fZ22m/3/ how do you pass values to styling
[13:34:52] <eddiemonge> Siecje: do what now?
[13:38:39] <banttu> I am trying to clone the last div but I instead end up cloning all elements with the div's class name => http://jsfiddle.net/mHXjQ/
[13:41:18] <jedimind> banttu http://jsfiddle.net/mHXjQ/1/
[13:43:31] <Siecje> eddiemonge: how do I use those numbers when styling
[13:44:14] <clov3r> Siecje: div:enabled.1, div:enabled.2 ?
[13:44:42] <clov3r> not really jquery
[13:45:39] <eddiemonge> Siecje: http://jsfiddle.net/fZ22m/6/
[13:46:25] <banttu> jedimind: Thanks man
[13:47:08] <jedimind> banttu just fyi -1 is just "last one"
[13:47:17] <jedimind> so you dont have to do length -1
[13:48:58] <banttu> Got it.
[13:52:10] <Siecje> clov3r: eddiemonge but then I need to have every single number in there and the number is dynamic
[13:52:25] <eddiemonge> Siecje: what are you trying to do?
[13:52:50] <Siecje> I am trying to tab out words based on their depth in a tree
[13:53:11] <Siecje> a node can be any number of levels deep
[13:54:08] <eddiemonge> tab out words?
[13:54:17] <clov3r> $('.c1').css({"property":"value"}) ?
[13:55:18] <Siecje> add spaces based on a number
[13:55:57] <Siecje> clov3r: ok and how does the css accept the value?
[13:56:09] <jedimind> holy hell dud
[13:56:09] <jedimind> e
[13:56:15] <jedimind> you cannot pass values into css properties
[13:56:20] <jedimind> css has no variables
[13:56:28] <jedimind> you can render inline css or adjust css properties inline using javascript
[13:56:47] <jedimind> and if you dont understand those basic principles, then perhaps you need to invest some time to understand how this works
[13:56:51] <jedimind> before asking random questions
[13:57:07] <jedimind> you're asking the equivalent of "how do i get my car to make the toast darker?"
[13:57:14] <eddiemonge> Siecje: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/xkT9S/
[13:58:03] <Siecje> eddiemonge: yea but I just have a list of nodes and their depth
[13:58:08] <Siecje> not their parents
[13:58:28] <eddiemonge> are there a finite number of depths?
[13:58:37] <Siecje> nope
[13:58:54] <eddiemonge> so in essence you could have a depth of 1 million?
[13:59:16] <Siecje> not realistically
[13:59:37] <jonkri> how can i make hover in and out events be triggered on divs "below" the current element that are not parents to the current element (due to use of position)?
[13:59:57] <Siecje> jonkri: by below do you mean inside the div?
[14:01:12] <eddiemonge> Siecje: http://jsfiddle.net/fZ22m/7/
[14:02:13] <jonkri> Siecje: yes, inside, thanks
[14:05:13] <Siecje> eddiemonge: so that caps at overflow? is that why you were asking when does it stop working?
[14:06:21] <eddiemonge> Siecje: huh? no. i dont know.
[14:07:42] <clov3r> jonkri: $('.higher').on("mouseover", function() { $('.lower').trigger("mouseover"); }); ?
[14:13:34] <PugSQL> I have a getJSON request in a twitter bootstrap nav-pane, and I want it to run whenever the pane is viewed... as it is now it only runs the first time you click on the pane.. could anyone give me a hint?
[14:14:18] <jonkri> clov3r: thanks, i thought about that. it will work on .higher because it completely covers the .lower, but onmouseout wont work since .lower is bigger than .higher (and .higher is on the edge of .lower) :S
[14:14:40] <jkl555> guys, what framework would you recommend a javascript beginner to dive into (code wise) to learn patterns and best practices?
[14:14:50] <jkl555> currently i'm digging into the twitter's bootstrap js plugins
[14:14:59] <andreww> jkl555: jquery is a popular one.
[14:15:08] <jkl555> is it a good start for beginner?
[14:15:22] <jkl555> not as a jQuery user
[14:15:29] <NoiseEee> http://eloquentjavascript.net/ @ jkl555
[14:15:41] <jkl555> as a javascript programmer.. that is.. seeing the code and learning how the guys solved common problems
[14:16:00] <jkl555> NoiseEee i bought that book
[14:16:04] <jkl555> didn't get to it yet
[14:16:13] <NoiseEee> well you *do* have to read things to learn, unfortunately
[14:16:37] <jkl555> i read
[14:16:55] <jkl555> i like professional javascript for web developers
[14:17:02] <jkl555> its indepth
[14:17:09] <jkl555> but just started it
[14:18:08] <jedimind> they have books to teach you things now ?
[14:18:09] <jedimind> holy shit
[14:18:40] <PugSQL> Why can I only run this function once? http://dpaste.com/1195670/
[14:20:52] <myosotis> perhaps there is some sort of check on the gmap() call or the bind call that notices that it has already been done
[14:21:33] <myosotis> maybe you're just rebinding the init event onto the already existing gmap object, that's already been initialized
[14:21:51] <PugSQL> myosotis, thanks.. guess I have to check the jquery ui maps-docs.
[14:22:21] <jkl555> :D
[14:22:39] <jkl555> jedimind, we're gonna be best friends
[14:22:57] <jedimind> on that note
[14:44:36] <jonkri> so this is my problem: <http://jsfiddle.net/PYzc6/>. i want hover events on the black div ('another-inner') to trigger on the blue div ('one-inner'; which is also "below" the blue div). any ideas?
[14:45:56] <guideX> for the last few days, I had a conflict between fancybox and jquery ui selectmenu where on subsequent loads, the select menu would be all screwed up... it turned out to be I was loading jquery ui js file in the popup over and over ago. Deleteing it entirely from the popup code fixed the problem
[14:48:55] <guideX> thanks anyways to those who checked it out :)
[14:53:10] <eddiemonge> hey, thats my name

[15:01:06] <rgb_> is there a recommended way in order to call a plugin without having to specify an element? at the same time i want to be able to specify options for the plugin, e.g. $.theplugin({"debug" : true});
[15:03:35] <rgb_> i read about $.extend but i'm not quite sure how i would use it with both the plugin code and the options. right now i use it for the plugin code
[15:11:00] <rgb_> would it work like this? http://www.0bin.net/paste/b30fc9d22aaaf2cb26e4eac5abbd26a955b2176e#wEi/517FiHaOF8WwqIERdgfzyPhhrC560FMxmQfHGnE=
[15:22:52] <RohanBhangui> have an issue: so when i press a link it sends some data to my database and the data base returns some data which is appended to a div.....now i need that div to be clickable (which i used a link) but when i press the link it doesn't execute the click event that I have attached to it (the click event just console.log("hello); for now)
[15:23:22] <RohanBhangui> correction: the thing i append needs to be clickable
[15:23:44] <RohanBhangui> basically my server generated content is not executing the click event i attached to it
[15:26:35] <RohanBhangui> any ideas guys?
[15:27:27] <systemfault> RohanBhangui: Normally, unless you use event delegation, the content must exist at the moment where you attach the event
[15:27:42] <RohanBhangui> how do i do event delegation
[15:28:08] <RohanBhangui> i get that the jquery script only gets executed at the beginning of the page load
[15:28:41] <systemfault> $(document).on("click", "select your link here", function(event){});
[15:29:26] <RohanBhangui> "select your link here" is the name of the id right?
[15:29:30] <RohanBhangui> of the link
[15:29:37] <systemfault> Yeah
[15:29:58] <systemfault> $(document).on("click", "#my-link", function(event){});
[15:30:56] <RohanBhangui> kk thx man
[15:31:45] <joobie> hey guys.. can someone help with this example to make the images switch with an animate / blend effect? trying to get it so that image1 is shown, then image2 blends into it and then takes over image1 entirely. Then so on with image3 doing the same with image2? http://jsfiddle.net/tLRKR/
[15:31:46] <RohanBhangui> again you need event delegation because the js script only laods at beginning of page load
[15:32:46] <RohanBhangui> joobie: is it automatically?
[15:33:03] <joobie> RohanBhangui, ya ideally it should with just that delay
[15:33:11] <RohanBhangui> kk
[15:33:11] <joobie> i put it in a setInterval timer
[15:33:25] <joobie> but i can't figure out a smart way to do that logic to cycle the images
[15:33:46] <andreww> theres a better way to do this
[15:33:55] <RohanBhangui> joobie: im tinker hold
[15:34:00] <andreww> http://davidwalsh.name/street-fighter
[15:34:02] <andreww> look at this
[15:35:11] <systemfault> andreww: That's fun :)
[15:39:20] <RohanBhangui> joobie: do you need li structure?
[15:39:27] <RohanBhangui> sry table structure
[15:48:35] <RohanBhangui> joobie: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/HnqHu/1/ <-------try that
[15:48:40] <systemfault> joobie needs absolute positioning
[15:55:49] <joobie> sorry I had a phone call
[15:55:55] <joobie> back, checking out example
[15:57:53] <joobie> RohanBhangui, that is perfect :) Thank you.. How does this work though? what does index * 250 do?
[15:59:10] <joobie> RohanBhangui, i ask because the blend is not ideal in that the first image is still visible whilst the 3rd image is there
[15:59:24] <joobie> it should sorta be image1 -> image2 .. then image2 -> image3
[16:02:19] <joobie> ahhh is ee
[16:02:24] <joobie> you playing with CSS index
[16:02:26] <joobie> very smart :P
[16:03:27] <joobie> RohanBhangui, how to make it so that image1 -> image2 completes, then do image2 -> image3 ?

[16:19:28] <banttu> trying to rename my cloned elements can't seem to get it right. => http://jsfiddle.net/M4mh5/ am I missing something?
[16:23:49] <shoky> banttu: $('.list:first-child')  selects the .list element
[16:24:02] <shoky> banttu: also, none of your elements have a 'name' attribute
[16:26:18] <shoky> banttu: also... <font> is long deprecated. use css for styling
[16:28:07] <banttu> shoky: I'd left out some radio buttons, those are the ones with the name attr. . .lemmi add them back
[16:28:46] <shoky> banttu: there's still the first issue, and, you need to select the element with the name attribute if you wanna change it
[16:30:28] <banttu> shoky: Oh right, the first-child selector. Let me see how that works out.
[16:37:26] <banttu> shoky: updated it => http://jsfiddle.net/M4mh5/2/ I'm almost sure I'm selecting the right children.
[16:38:51] <shoky> banttu: $('.mkebe:first-child')  selects the _first_ .mkebe element
[16:39:12] <shoky> banttu: and it's working, check the name of the radios in the first .mkebe

[16:45:05] <banttu> shoky: thanks man. That's a start, I'll tinker with it some more since I need more clones.
[16:45:29] <shoky> banttu: the last one will work for any number of clones
[16:46:09] <shoky> (but it assumes the original one has a number)
[16:46:25] <banttu> shoky: I feel like I owe you. Shit. Thanks!
[16:46:37] <shoky> np
[16:48:22] <banttu> shoky: That replace stuff is neat!
[16:48:38] <guideX> i'm thinking of a jquery plugin... It takes multiple images, and sorts them in their parent container so they're taking equal spacing, and resizes them to maintain a certain scale, anyone know of one?
[16:48:56] <guideX> was hopeing to call it like this $("#mydiv").organizeImages(); (or something)
[16:51:56] <guideX> maybe jquery image montage will do it

[17:17:01] <eydaimon> I've got an event handler to trigger like so ...   $('.btn.cart').on "click", (e) ->. How can I reference this handler and bind it to a new object I've created which matches the criteria?
[17:17:52] <eydaimon> $('.btn.cart').on("click", function(e) {});  incase the coffee script is upsetting anyone ...
[17:18:58] <eydaimon> maybe I better give the function a name so I can reference it instead
[17:29:53] <lukasstr> good evening ;), i think this isn't really interesting for most of you - but here is my fist cakephp plugin: https://github.com/sakulstra/cakephp-timedmessages . feel free to try it! it's more or less a simple plugin which displays all Session->flash() messages for a configurable time (sry for my english)
[17:31:10] <eydaimon> $('body').on "click", ".btn.cart", (e) -> worked.
[17:34:30] <engaged> I'm doing: $(".link").click().delay(2200,function() { window.location = 'google.com'; });    is there a reason this doesn't work on the click?
[17:35:20] <redner> hey guys - I need some help with an AJAX loacer
[17:35:21] <redner> loader
[17:40:25] <engaged> I'm doing: $(".link").click().delay(2200,function() { window.location = 'google.com'; });    is there a reason this doesn't work on the click?
[17:43:18] <didiergm> engaged look at the delay syntax - your usage is wrong
[17:43:27] <engaged> whats wrong?
[17:44:30] <didiergm> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[17:44:49] <didiergm> can't call function like that
[17:45:30] <didiergm> redner ?
[17:46:55] <engaged> what do i do then
[17:46:57] <engaged> that url doesn't help
[17:47:01] <engaged> can you just do it?
[17:48:20] <engaged> didiergm: ?
[17:49:51] <engaged> fucking christ i can't get it, can you just tell me what to do didiergm
[17:51:35] <thujone> you shouldn't be using delay() at all
[17:51:50] <engaged> what should i be using
[17:51:52] <aghouseh> anyone know if its possible to fully emulate the confirm() method with a jquery ui dialog? talking about full "blocking" i guess.. so you can do an if(customDialog()) { blah; } and it will wait for the response.
[17:51:58] <thujone> setTimeout()
[17:52:08] <thujone> delay() is for waiting between two animations
[17:52:34] <didiergm> engaged - sorry it's 2.50 am, not in the mood to be weared at
[17:52:42] <didiergm> s/weared/sweared/

[18:04:27] <LordThumper> Image is not loading in the jsfiddle, however if you open the image in tab manually, the jsfiddle works by loading the image from cache
[18:04:34] <LordThumper> What could the problem be?
[18:04:49] <thujone> yeah, engaged put it in jsfiddle
[18:04:53] <thujone> much easier that way
[18:05:37] <engaged> <a href="www.yahoo.com" class="link" target="_blank">
[18:06:34] <didiergm> engaged so what happens when you click ?
[18:06:44] <engaged> new link opens in new tab, nothing in current window
[18:06:59] <shoky> $(document).ready(..) ?
[18:07:55] <didiergm> _blank opens in new window or tab, tried _self instead ?
[18:08:03] <didiergm> êngaged
[18:08:06] <engaged> oh god damn mother fucker
[18:08:09] <didiergm> ^engaged
[18:08:11] <engaged> spelled the class wrong
[18:08:43] <thujone> also, "motherfucker" is one word
[18:08:57] <didiergm> thujone :)
[18:09:03] <MickRip> perhaps the 2-word version is correct as well :P
[18:09:20] <thujone> maybe...
[18:09:28] <MickRip> but the truncation is cooler
[18:09:40] <engaged> actually still not working
[18:09:41] <engaged> crap
[18:09:50] <thujone> lordthumper: the graphic is being sent incorrectly from the server
[18:09:53] <thujone> might be that
[18:10:09] <didiergm> engaged - again tried target _self ?
[18:10:11] <MickRip> engaged: http://www.yahoo?
[18:10:26] <MickRip> rather than http://yourself.com/www.yahoo.com
[18:10:40] <thujone> wrong headers or something
[18:10:52] <shoky> didiergm: .click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... })
[18:11:00] <shoky> sorry, meant that for engaged
[18:11:10] <didiergm> shoky np
[18:12:14] <engaged> there we fucking go
[18:12:16] <engaged> got it
[18:12:21] <engaged> i misspelled it again a second time
[18:12:22] <engaged> thx guys
[18:12:28] <MickRip> the preventDault would have fixed it :P

[19:19:16] <lenswipee> beakman: $('input.last').remove().append(.....your new input...);

[19:28:46] <bot-t> To disable an input: $('input[name=poo]').attr('disabled','disabled'); To enable it: .removeAttr('disabled');
[19:30:57] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/6/ <-- if your bored
[19:31:10] <coldhead> you're*
[19:32:03] <lenswipee> coldhead: Hi buddy, care to take a look at my amateur code?
[19:32:43] <tw2113> seems to be working for me
[19:32:53] <coldhead> i'm only doing grammar at this point, sorry
[19:33:23] <tw2113> g'day mate
[19:33:24] <lenswipee> tw2113: i actually don't want it disabled :-)
[19:33:41] <tw2113> so give more than 1 option
[19:34:17] <lenswipee> tw2113: when there is only one option then i don't want it to behave to a select
[19:34:25] <tw2113> it doesn't seem to be
[19:34:27] <lenswipee> tw2113: so make it not clickable
[19:34:29] <tw2113> i can't click anything with it
[19:35:02] <tw2113> it's just there
[19:35:09] <tw2113> all disabled n shit
[19:35:46] <tw2113> i'm tempted to call a nursing home for it, it's so comatose
[19:36:22] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/7/
[19:36:25] <lenswipee> tw2113
[19:36:45] <tw2113> now it's not disabled
[19:36:48] <tw2113> it's alive!
[19:36:59] <lenswipee> its clickable and drops down with the option
[19:37:05] <tw2113> version 6 didn't
[19:37:08] <lenswipee> read the comments bro
[19:37:10] <tw2113> i am
[19:37:20] <tw2113> version 6 was doing what the comments requested
[19:37:24] <lenswipee> yeh, i realised disable is not the way
[19:37:30] <tw2113> why not?
[19:37:39] <tw2113> clicking on it at that state does zero things
[19:37:48] <tw2113> not even show a dropdown
[19:37:59] <lenswipee> because it looks "greyed" out which i don't want
[19:38:13] <tw2113> is grayed out
[19:38:15] <tw2113> what's wrong with that?
[19:38:28] <lenswipee> i just want a select menu with one option to not be clickable
[19:38:33] <tw2113> and it's not
[19:38:41] <lenswipee> if there is more then clickable is fine
[19:38:43] <tw2113> i click, it just sits there
[19:38:50] <tw2113> does absolutely nothing
[19:39:05] <lenswipee> well on IE9, when i click it drops down with the same option
[19:39:15] <tw2113> well that's because IE9 is doodoo
[19:39:31] <tw2113> firefox is doing what you want
[19:39:44] <lenswipee> right
[19:40:06] <lenswipee> lets do an IE9 fix
[19:40:08] <lenswipee> :-)
[19:40:29] <tw2113> bug fix their handling of single option dropdowns
[19:40:34] <tw2113> i'm sure they'll accept it right away
[19:40:52] <lenswipee> or not
[19:41:03] <lenswipee> time to move on i think
[19:41:08] <lenswipee> thanks tw2113
[19:42:47] <tw2113> *burp*
[19:43:00] <relipse> how do i add 2 arrays together
[19:43:32] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584370/how-to-merge-two-arrays-in-javascript
[19:43:59] <lenswipee> from memory i think you do.
[19:44:20] <lenswipee> $arr_merge = $arr1 + $arr2;
[19:44:32] <lenswipee> but i could be wrong.
[19:47:44] <tw2113> the one in the link i pasted retains it as an array
[19:47:55] <tw2113> lenswipee's method turned it to string from the looks of it
[19:49:29] <lenswipee> oh, then the next line would be: $arr_merge.toArray();
[19:49:49] <lenswipee> I think the link is better than mine
[20:09:46] <joobie> guys, how to reference the <a>'s within this structure with jquery ?<div id="moo"><ul><li><a></a></li><li><a></a></li><li><a></a></li></ul></div>
[20:11:47] <tw2113> $('#moo a')
[20:12:26] <joobie> thanks tw2113
[20:16:29] <joobie> tw2113, http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/18/ .. how can i make it so that it alert's the nth <a> clicked?
[20:16:41] <joobie> so for example, if the 2nd dot is clicked, it says "2"
[20:16:43] <joobie> in the alert
[20:17:09] <joobie> .. can it be defined by the nth element, rather than me setting a id or value to the <a> ?
[20:17:44] <tw2113> i'd have to tinker
[20:45:20] <joobie> tw2113, FYI ('#clickedItems a').index($(this)) did the trick
[20:45:30] <tw2113> cool
[21:09:51] <joobie> guys, if i have <img class="moo" /><img class="moo" /><img class="moo" /> .. how can i reference the 2nd img class of moo?
[21:12:45] <screamingbanshee> $("img.moo")[1]
[21:23:27] <joobie> screamingbanshee, is there a way to select all other elements of that class excluding [1] ?
[21:23:42] <joobie> .. without looping through all of them with a for loop
[21:23:47] <joobie> like can selector do it?
[21:24:50] <screamingbanshee> probably the easiest way to do it with a selector would be, to add another class to [1]
[21:25:10] <screamingbanshee> <img class="not moo">
[21:26:45] <mike_f> Anyone know offhand what the right callback is for when someone types into a text input?
[21:27:06] <MickRip> mike_f: I use keyUp
[21:27:59] <screamingbanshee> $('img.moo').not($(".not"))
[21:28:21] <mike_f> I was trying change, but it didn't appear to work. I see on stackoverflow that it works when you lose focus.
[21:28:39] <screamingbanshee> or something similar should work, joobie
[21:30:41] <MickRip> mike_f: what's why I bind the event to something to do with the keys. Actually, not 100% sure how it works with mobile devices - best to test that one :P
[21:31:32] <redner> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6835e469dc68aebac63f can someone help me out with this
[21:31:34] <mike_f> I'm just trying to enable/disable a button based on if the user has entered a value in 2 textboxes and added something to a list. :)
[21:31:43] <redner> I am trying to figure out the correct reload code for AJAX
[21:32:35] <mike_f> I have this interesting JS app I'm writing to create a bunch of geospatial objects.
[21:32:43] <joobie> screamingbanshee, can it be fixed up in here - http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/21/ .. line 5?
[21:33:09] <Cork> redner: you would have to check what ajax-page-loader.js does
[21:34:39] <screamingbanshee> joobie - sorta. which one did you want to avoid?
[21:34:46] <redner> hmm i think i need to pay someone for this lol
[21:34:47] <screamingbanshee> the 2nd image?
[21:35:14] <Cork> redner: or contact the group that has written the library you're using
[21:35:30] <redner> yeah i sent out some emails
[21:35:33] <redner> its a decent plugin
[21:35:34] <Cork> redner: sure jquery is used at the end of it, but you are depending on other librarys
[21:35:39] <redner> right
[21:35:54] <redner> its just a matter of calling the right things and using the right sytax
[21:36:17] <Cork> well you could always start by reading the library or look for it's documentation
[21:36:19] <redner> I'm whatever comes before a noob so it is better i engage someone that knows what the heck they are doing
[21:37:08] <joobie> screamingbanshee, check out http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/22/ ..
[21:37:20] <screamingbanshee> ok
[21:37:22] <joobie> screamingbanshee, it's basically meant to avoid fadeOut of the image that is not selected
[21:37:39] <joobie> screamingbanshee, but for some reason, it alerts "w00t" 3 times there, rather than 2 so the not logic must be wrong
[21:37:44] <screamingbanshee> ok, so fadeOut the selected image, right?
[21:38:04] <joobie> nono
[21:38:09] <joobie> fadeOut the unselected images
[21:38:19] <joobie> fadeIn the selected image.. fadeIn works OK, just want to fadeOut all the othres
[21:38:36] <redner> Is there a typical reason as to why clicking on a link wont load and throws that cannot call error index0f undefined?
[21:38:51] <Cork> no
[21:38:57] <redner> gtocha
[21:39:03] <Cork> normally cause it isn't the object it expects
[21:39:28] <screamingbanshee> ok
[21:39:33] <redner> the plugin does have an area for "click code" which is what i think the problem is
[21:39:33] <screamingbanshee> gimme a sec
[21:43:56] <joobie> thanks screamingbanshee
[21:45:47] <joobie> screamingbanshee, it actually works
[21:45:53] <joobie> it fades out the other images
[21:45:56] <screamingbanshee> yeah
[21:45:58] <joobie> .. but for some reason, it loops 3 times
[21:46:39] <screamingbanshee> add a class in your on click - like, "active" and use that to tell it to skip
[21:46:44] <screamingbanshee> which is what I'm doing
[21:46:53] <joobie> ahh.. but can't i use use not?
[21:47:56] <joobie> i dont think that :not is correct
[21:50:18] <joobie> screamingbanshee, got it - http://jsfiddle.net/HnqHu/23/
[21:55:07] <screamingbanshee> lol there you go
[22:42:05] <goddard> can I get an image url from an input field and upload the image with ajax without submitting the form?
[22:43:43] <Cork> goddard: in modern browser yes
[22:43:54] <Cork> cross browsers... kinda but not natively

[22:44:25] <aneki> what would cause serialize to not serialize a form?
[22:44:48] <Cork> aneki: the question is too generic
[22:45:07] <Cork> only real answer i can give to that question is "lots of things"
[22:46:08] <redner> cork are you the only one in here?
[22:46:11] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net/ujhD8/
[22:46:21] <aneki> it just returns null/undefined
[22:46:22] <redner> never mind
[22:47:17] <Cork> aneki: you don't have any active form fields in the form
[22:47:21] <aneki> i have *no* idea why
[22:47:22] <aneki> what?
[22:47:25] <aneki> what do you mean
[22:47:29] <Cork> an active form field need to have a name
[22:47:43] <Cork> and none of your <input> or <select> elements have a name attribute
[22:47:49] <aneki> its assigned with jquery
[22:48:14] <Cork> none of your <input> or <select> elements have a name attribute; thats why serialize doesn't find anything
[22:49:32] <oojacoboo> how can I get the contents of a textarea with the line breaks÷
[22:49:43] <oojacoboo> s/÷/?
[22:50:00] <Cork> .val()
[22:50:00] <b-ot> Cork: for form fields
[22:50:06] <oojacoboo> Cork: nope, try again
[22:50:13] <Cork> yes
[22:50:18] <oojacoboo> no
[22:50:22] <Cork> it won't include live wraps though
[22:50:30] <Cork> but it includes linebreaks
[22:50:55] <oojacoboo> Cork: how can I see them included?
[22:51:06] <oojacoboo> do I have to serialize it to post it?
[22:51:15] <Cork> you would have to calculate the text width of the area and insert linebreaks
[22:51:16] <oojacoboo> to POST the value
[22:51:29] <oojacoboo> Cork: huh?
[22:51:31] <aneki> OH HAPPY DAYS
[22:51:36] <aneki> it werx
[22:51:42] <Cork> there is no way to get get the textarea to hardcode line wraps
[22:51:44] <aneki> back to symfony magic
[22:51:59] <oojacoboo> aneki: you trolling me?
[22:52:02] <aneki> huh?
[22:52:06] <aneki> wtf
[22:52:13] * aneki chokes oojacoboo
[22:52:18] <oojacoboo> I was complaining about sf magic earlier
[22:52:26] <aneki> pure coincidence
[22:52:34] <oojacoboo> Cork: so there is no way to get the line breaks then, that's what you're saying
[22:52:46] <Cork> line breaks is included by default
[22:52:50] <Cork> theres a difference
[22:53:17] <Cork> line wraps is where the text is wrapped cause it would overflow horizontally
[22:53:18] <oojacoboo> Cork: okay, let's start over here then… I need to POST the contents of a textarea and I need the line breaks encoded and included with the POST
[22:53:28] <Cork> line breaks is entered by the enter key
[22:53:32] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:53:34] <oojacoboo> I know
[22:53:36] <oojacoboo> that's what I'm talking about
[22:53:56] <Cork> then .val() or serialzie() will include them by default
[22:54:06] <aneki> oojacoboo what are you trying to do
[22:54:11] <oojacoboo> aneki: just explain it
[22:54:15] <oojacoboo> explained*
[22:54:15] * tw2113 runs by and hugs Cork for no explainable reason
[22:54:44] <aneki> you want line breaks encoded and included with post from a textarea? they already are
[22:55:00] <oojacoboo> aneki: they ain't workin
[22:55:02] <aneki> unless you are stripping them out prior to post with javascript, they are there
[22:55:09] <Cork> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/fHEur/
[22:55:09] <oojacoboo> aneki: I'm not
[22:55:14] <aneki> then they are there ;)
[22:55:30] <aneki> got a link?
[22:55:39] <oojacoboo> Cork: yes, I see that, BUT, when you POST that, it's not going to add the \n
[22:55:47] <aneki> of course it does
[22:56:03] <oojacoboo> well, it's not doing it for me
[22:56:14] <aneki> got any code?
[22:56:22] <oojacoboo> backend stuff, sorry
[22:56:27] <aneki> well that complicates things
[22:56:33] <oojacoboo> yep
[22:56:37] <aneki> its your front end thats stripping it, not the back end
[22:56:44] <aneki> how are you posting it?
[22:56:49] <oojacoboo> $.post()
[22:57:05] <aneki> can you create a fiddle with your jquery code
[22:57:48] <oojacoboo> aneki: I think I have an idea, one sec
[22:58:22] <aneki> ok
[22:59:55] <aneki> phpstorm will be the death of me
[23:00:04] <oojacoboo> love phpstorm
[23:00:12] <aneki> its for suckers
[23:00:16] <oojacoboo> pssh
[23:00:19] <aneki> it keeps mucking with my indenting
[23:00:25] <oojacoboo> aneki: you can set that
[23:00:30] <aneki> and the DBGp is all jacked
[23:00:31] <oojacoboo> your indentation prefs
[23:00:38] <oojacoboo> it's very customizable
[23:00:59] <oojacoboo> and I fixed this issue, thanks Cork
[23:01:00] <Cork> can't get the ajax example code on jsfiddle to work
[23:01:05] <Cork> but ya it works
[23:01:08] <oojacoboo> it does...
[23:01:14] <aneki> what was the issue?
[23:01:15] <oojacoboo> I was including the var in the request url
[23:01:22] <oojacoboo> instead of POSTing the data
[23:01:28] <Cork> heh
[23:01:31] <oojacoboo> yea :/
[23:01:35] <aneki> /faceboot
[23:01:42] <Cork> well as long as it was url encoded it should still have worked :)
[23:01:52] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea… but that would have required I did that
[23:01:55] <oojacoboo> which I did not
[23:01:59] <Cork> :)
[23:02:37] <oojacoboo> I just need to get in a better habit of not using the request url and using "data"
[23:03:41] <faraway> i have a question regarding iframe and .data() and event handlers. is my assumption right, that it is a bad idea to set data or attach events a node of another document then the one jquery was loaded with, because this internal data then lives in the wrong window and i could get leaks if load another page in the iframe or reload its content?
[23:04:17] <oojacoboo> iframes are typically a bad idea in general
[23:04:25] <oojacoboo> but yes, overall it's going to be a bad idea
[23:04:25] <aneki> if used incorrectly
[23:04:30] <oojacoboo> I'm unsure about the leaks though
[23:04:34] <oojacoboo> aneki: in general
[23:04:47] <oojacoboo> there are cases where they're appropriate
[23:04:55] <aneki> yeah
[23:05:15] <aneki> why is this page returning a 201 on curl? http://offbeatr.com/
[23:05:17] <oojacoboo> use pjax bro, not iframes
[23:05:19] <aneki> oops
[23:05:23] <faraway> oojacoboo: that iframes are a bad idea in general is true .. but it is for displaying data in the page that should not be effected by other stylsheets
[23:05:38] <oojacoboo> faraway: lurn2css
[23:06:22] <oojacoboo> faraway: prefix your css with a specific parent DOM element
[23:06:53] <tw2113> the only time i find iframes worth their weight in salt is when housing a youtube video
[23:07:58] <oojacoboo> tw2113: sharing widgets with clients to put on their site
[23:08:07] <oojacoboo> so you can host the code, also nice
[23:08:53] <oojacoboo> tw2113: I also found another cool use was to inject a lot of view into the DOM that you want to be able to have it's own printing without the rest of the DOM
[23:09:31] <tw2113> i think that's why they invented print stylesheets and @media rules
[23:09:36] <aneki> we use iframes for embedding project widgets
[23:09:43] <oojacoboo> tw2113: yes, but that doesn't remove everything else
[23:09:50] <tw2113> display:none
[23:09:57] <oojacoboo> lol… WAY TOO much work
[23:10:10] <oojacoboo> you'd have to add 100 display: none rules
[23:10:11] <tw2113> and worth the work to not rely on iframe bs
[23:10:31] <oojacoboo> tw2113: I wish I could agree
[23:10:31] <tw2113> or just add display:none to the highest parent you need to get the job done
[23:10:39] <tw2113> children go with it
[23:10:41] <aneki> ok oojacoboo: is this an acceptable use of an iframe? http://jsfiddle.net/aXvuR/
[23:10:42] <oojacoboo> tw2113: the highest parent would hide the content
[23:10:46] <oojacoboo> you'd have to work your way around it
[23:10:55] <tw2113> header { display: none; }
[23:11:03] <tw2113> sidebar { display: none; }
[23:11:04] <oojacoboo> tw2113: complex UI
[23:11:04] <tw2113> etc
[23:11:10] <oojacoboo> yes, work your way around it...
[23:11:18] <tw2113> leave the content area alone, 100% width, 16px+ font size
[23:11:28] <tw2113> 3-4 display none blocks
[23:11:29] <oojacoboo> tw2113: I know how to do it ;)
[23:11:43] <tw2113> yet you grossly overcompensate the work
[23:11:49] <oojacoboo> tw2113: I was also able to use the same view file for it's own independent page
[23:11:51] <oojacoboo> and more
[23:12:00] <faraway> oojacoboo: anyway the question is more because i want to know if i understood the internals correctly (i still would like to know it even if i would not go with the iframe approach  )
[23:12:16] <oojacoboo> faraway: your case absolutely doesnt' need an iframe
[23:12:28] <oojacoboo> if you don't want other css applying, then prefix the css
[23:13:12] <Cork> oojacoboo: depends if you want sandboxing iframes is the way to go
[23:13:44] <Cork> that is actually the only situation i can find a defense for iframes
[23:13:49] <oojacoboo> faraway: is this something you'll share with clients?
[23:13:57] <oojacoboo> as a "widget" ?
[23:14:08] <oojacoboo> where you don't have control over their css?
[23:14:18] <oojacoboo> b/c yes, that's a very valid use case for an iframe
[23:17:46] <tw2113> at least until the css provided stops matching the current site design and stands out badly :P
[23:18:22] <Cork> or unless the widget is built to be integrated into the page
[23:19:04] <tw2113> provide a method to pass in an object of color key/value pairs
[23:19:08] <oojacoboo> having control over the code from your end is also a massive plus that an iframe can offer
[23:19:21] <faraway> oojacoboo: to explain it a little bit more (and again it does not really matter, because the question was about it i understand the internals correctly) it is for displaying messages in a internal system from various sources (e.g. emails, that could have html content, or from other sources) prefixing there will not always work, and yes i know that i even should load it with another subdomain so that a script that was not striped out of that
[23:19:21] <faraway> messages could have access to the displaying system (and yes then i would not be able to access the iframes content because or cross domain policy).
[23:19:52] <Cork> oojacoboo: you can still have control over the code without resorting to iframes
[23:20:00] <oojacoboo> Cork: you can, yes
[23:20:10] <Cork> from the users point of view there is another matter though
[23:20:10] <oojacoboo> cross-domain sucks though
[23:20:12] <tw2113> doesn't google do that a lot?
[23:20:26] <Cork> wanting to isolate the content from a third party
[23:20:33] <Cork> iframes? no
[23:20:46] <Cork> they usually build classes to protect the inner parts of the code
[23:20:48] <tw2113> no, the controlling code without iframes part you said
[23:20:55] <Cork> the widgets you can fiddle with how much you like
[23:20:55] <oojacoboo> all those like buttons and crap… all iframes
[23:21:07] <oojacoboo> and for good reason
[23:21:08] <tw2113> and i hate facebook for the shit they pull
[23:21:17] <oojacoboo> tw2113: they all do that
[23:21:18] <Cork> ya, cause they want it to be easy to inject it into a page
[23:21:24] <tw2113> so i hate them all
[23:21:25] <Cork> without having to think about the js
[23:21:26] <tw2113> i can deal
[23:21:26] <oojacoboo> twitter, facebook, google +, etc
[23:21:31] <oojacoboo> ha
[23:21:40] <oojacoboo> Cork: exactly
[23:21:55] <oojacoboo> which is why it's a good idea, but a lot of reasons which far outweigh the negatives
[23:21:56] <Cork> theres also the problem of wanting to prevent the logged in user data to leak to the page
[23:22:07] <Cork> and that is the biggest reason for them to use iframes
[23:22:20] <oojacoboo> and js conflicts
[23:22:27] <Cork> when i talked about googles things before i meant more like google maps
[23:22:38] <Cork> js conflicts isn't normally a problem
[23:22:49] <Cork> its not hard to isolate the js so it can't conflict
[23:23:24] <oojacoboo> Cork: still a consideration
[23:23:29] <Cork> not really
[23:24:15] <oojacoboo> anyway, I'm the only one in the office again at 2am, so I'm going home
[23:24:30] <Cork> third party cookies (for the likes and the like) and information about the user is the two most important reasons
[23:25:03] <Cork> most of the others can be handled in other none iframe related ways
[23:26:06] <aneki> what office are you at
[23:26:12] <aneki> its 2:30
[23:26:24] <Cork> office?
[23:26:26] <Cork> ah
[23:27:22] <Cork> gmt-4 not sure where that is
[23:27:31] <tw2113> eastern standard time
[23:27:52] <tw2113> indiana to the atlantic, more or less
[23:27:56] <oojacoboo> aneki: my office
[23:28:28] <aneki> is it in your basement
[23:28:30] <aneki> mine is
[23:28:34] <oojacoboo> lol, no, it's downtown
[23:29:23] <aneki> downtown atlanta
[23:29:35] <oojacoboo> close, Athens
[23:29:39] <aneki> doh
[23:29:49] <aneki> i used to work in alpharetta
[23:29:59] <oojacoboo> ah, nice
[23:30:34] <dokma> I've been developing and running jquery just fine using the $ notation
[23:30:36] <oojacoboo> fo real do, outski, peaceski weeski
[23:31:08] <dokma> now I've installed a plugin that uses jQuery( notation and I get 'jQuery not defined'
[23:31:27] <dokma> what is the way to have both $ and jQuery working simultaneously?
[23:31:33] <aneki> noConflict
[23:31:47] <dokma> aneki, that does not remove $ notation?
[23:31:51] <aneki> jQuery.noConflict()
[23:31:57] <Cork> dokma: jQuery should always be around as long as jquery is loaded
[23:32:07] <Cork> $ is just a shorthand variable for jQuery
[23:32:14] <aneki> jQuery.ajax()
[23:32:16] <dokma> ahhh... I see
[23:32:18] <aneki> jQuery.each()
[23:32:21] * aneki slaps dokma
[23:32:25] <dokma> let me see the order of inclusions
[23:33:26] <Cork> // Expose jQuery to the global object
[23:33:26] <Cork> window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;
[23:33:37] <Cork> taken from the jquery source
