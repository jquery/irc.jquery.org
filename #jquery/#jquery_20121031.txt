[00:00:03] <raj> haha
[00:00:06] <abjorn> idk, I'm only going to support people not using JS for like
[00:00:09] <abjorn> another year, maybe
[00:00:20] <abjorn> at that point I'll just be like "ok fuck you noscript users"
[00:00:31] <raj> they're blind
[00:00:37] <abletony84> coldhead: come again?
[00:00:39] <abjorn> "you know what you've done, you can handle the consequences"
[00:00:39] <raj> so they're still gonna exist in a year
[00:00:47] <nights> phiz: hm, so i can use that for all click actions and it will guarantee that even those elements that come in async gets bound?
[00:01:03] <raj> and it's illegal in places like UK
[00:01:18] <raj> ...not to support them
[00:01:37] <abjorn> Well, think about it, by that point the only people viewing websites without JavaScript will be NoScript users and Richard Stallman, both of which will expects some sites to not work without it.
[00:01:50] <nights> phiz: whats up with tbody and tr in the dexample there?
[00:02:05] <abjorn> I say "by then" but it's more than likely the case now.
[00:02:14] <nights> $("#dataTable tbody tr").on  ..
[00:02:21] <nights> why does tbody and tr need to be there?
[00:02:22] <phiz> nights: it's a selector
[00:02:29] <nights> can i just have the id?
[00:02:35] <phiz> sure
[00:02:37] <nights> (the new element's id)
[00:02:45] <phiz> no
[00:02:50] <nights> ok so i need like body?
[00:02:57] <phiz> i think you are missing the point?
[00:03:01] <nights> hm
[00:03:18] <nights> so
[00:03:27] <nights> as primary selector i use body
[00:03:37] <nights> and then in the "on" i put the new element's id?
[00:03:55] <nights> so the body element will delegate down to the new element?
[00:04:00] <nights> is that correct?
[00:05:43] <phiz> it is more like $(parent).on("click", function(e) { var targ = $(e.target); if( targ.is($("#id").first())) { ... }); });
[00:05:58] <raj> ok thanks for the talk abjorn, I'll be getting on top of this rewriting tomorrow
[00:05:59] <raj> fml
[00:06:01] <raj> goodnight
[00:06:26] <nights> hmm ah
[00:06:31] <nights> well thats what i mean'
[00:06:35] <nights> you start with the parent
[00:06:41] <phiz> but there is more than one way to skin a cat
[00:06:46] <nights> and then narrow down until you find the new element
[00:06:50] <phiz> that is just how I happen to implement it
[00:06:59] <nights> and then bind the event to that element?
[00:07:06] <abjorn> night yo
[00:07:09] <abjorn> im going to bed too
[00:07:12] <abjorn> SO TIRED
[00:07:13] <nights> i think it makes sense
[00:07:17] <nights> otsukare
[00:07:19] <abjorn> BYE BYE COLDHEAD
[00:07:28] <phiz> at the time you are using the .on() method the id doesn't exist yet correct
[00:07:36] <nights> yes
[00:07:37] <nights> it doesnt
[00:07:40] <nights> it comes in later
[00:07:47] <coldhead> bye forever, abjorn
[00:07:50] <abjorn> lol
[00:08:23] <phiz> otsukare
[00:08:42] <nights> :)
[00:08:59] <nights> phiz: so for performance the parent should be as close to the new element as possible?
[00:09:18] <nights> so its unwise but theoretically correct to always use tbody
[00:10:26] <abletony84> At this calculate-and-set-column-width script at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/yCEJs/2/ - purely cosmetic but, is there any way to do without "var widest_odd" and "var widest_even"?
[00:10:30] <phiz> nights: probably
[00:10:48] <nights> ok works now
[00:10:51] <nights> thanks very mucgh'
[00:10:57] <nights> obrigade
[00:10:58] <nights> arigato
[00:11:06] <nights> thank you
[00:11:10] <nights> mucho gracias
[00:11:14] <nights> tack sa mycket
[00:11:23] <nights> xie xie
[00:11:29] <phiz> nights: you can remove the on event w/ .off() btw
[00:11:32] <nights> danke schon
[00:11:46] <phiz> or use .one() for a one time event (runs once then removes itself)
[00:11:59] <nights> ok eccellente!
[00:12:56] <phiz> Bitteschon
[00:13:16] <phiz> zzz
[00:13:47] <nights> jeongmal gomawo
[00:13:51] <nights> thanks phiz
[00:13:55] <nights> this was great
[00:14:07] <nights> ive been confused by all bind, delegate etc before
[00:14:35] <phiz> nights: on is a replacement for those
[00:14:45] <phiz> they shouldn't be used anymore, they are deprecated
[00:15:17] <phiz> you are using on for what you used to use delegate for.
[00:20:34] <nights> phiz: yes i read that. its good, i dont want to touch them again
[00:24:39] <amitksaha> Hi all, is it possible to get the matching 'id' of a div for this snippet: https://gist.github.com/3985598
[00:25:07] <amitksaha> as you can see, i am using a 'startswith' selector
[00:25:56] <amitksaha> the matching 'id' is what I want to find
[00:27:44] <amitksaha> got it :)
[00:27:55] <amitksaha> $(this).attr('id')
[00:54:31] <Myx0x3> gosh, what is the name of the website where you can create test pictures? in what size you want.. like img.png?w=1337&h=1337
[01:15:18] <Qdest> So I've set up a couple of options for a plugin, now I'm wanting to do stuff based on what options are set. Should I go with the if () else if() else() or a switch() wit cases?
[01:15:24] <Qdest> with*
[01:19:23] <klawd> Qdest: depends
[01:20:02] <Qdest> klawd: Well, e.g. for options.slide I've got 3 possibilities. False (do this), fade (use .fadeIn/.fadeOut), easing (using jQ UI easings.
[01:20:26] <tintin> Anybody there, i have a question, can i ask?
[01:20:28] <Qdest> false is remove/addClass
[01:21:16] <klawd> tintin: dont ask to ask just ask
[01:21:18] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3985820 , after clicking the button, nothing happens, why?
[01:21:34] <Lebowski> can someone give me some tips to get menu items to close when i click them? http://jsfiddle.net/DAmYG/1/
[01:21:59] <klawd> Qdest: tintin you come from mootools?
[01:22:08] <klawd> err, tintin
[01:22:17] <klawd> Qdest: use if
[01:22:30] <tintin> klawd: What?
[01:22:42] <klawd> tintin: you need to select like with css
[01:22:46] <klawd> you foroget the hash
[01:22:53] <klawd> #id_input_button
[01:22:58] <Qdest> klawd: if (!options.slide) is the same as if (options.slide === false) ?
[01:23:11] <klawd> Qdest: no.
[01:23:22] <Qdest> What should I use to check if it's false?
[01:23:25] <klawd> if you pass 0 as options.slide it will trigger as well
[01:23:29] <klawd> === false
[01:23:35] <Qdest> thank you
[01:23:47] <klawd> that way you check if it really is a false
[01:23:50] <klawd> not a false value
[01:23:53] <klawd> like 0 or ''
[01:24:07] <tintin> klawd: Still doesn't work
[01:24:08] <klawd> it would work but it's not explicit
[01:24:30] <klawd> tintin: at the point you do it, the element does not exist yet
[01:24:38] <klawd> put the .click stuff into the .ready function
[01:24:55] <klawd> btw, $(document).ready() is the same as $(function() {})
[01:25:43] <tintin> klawd: still not working https://gist.github.com/3985848
[01:25:44] <klawd> tintin: https://gist.github.com/3985847#comments
[01:26:46] <klawd> tintin: check the latest comment
[01:29:05] <tintin> klawd: Why do i have to put that .click event inside $(documen).ready(function() { .. } ); ?
[01:29:35] <klawd> tintin: because at the point that script is run, the element you want to access does not exist
[01:29:41] <klawd> so you need to wait for the document to be ready
[01:30:13] <klawd> id_input_button is below your script tag
[01:31:11] <tintin> klawd: But that .click event was before </script> tag
[01:31:45] <BinaryKitten> but the element it was accessing wasn't
[01:32:02] <klawd> tintin: look at where your script tag is, now look where your input button is
[01:32:05] <klawd> is the button below?
[01:32:05] <BinaryKitten> it's like trying to drive your car with the keys before you've bought the car
[01:33:19] <tintin> klawd: What's wrong with this? https://gist.github.com/3985867
[01:35:13] <klawd> tintin: looks ok. does it still not give you an alert?
[01:35:26] <tintin> No, it does not give alert .
[01:35:47] <klawd> tintin: do you get an exception or something in the console?
[01:37:15] <mazzachre> Hmmm... $(':input').not(':disabled') returns hidden fields that are not disabled, $(':input').filter(':enalbed') does not return hidden fields that are not disabled, neither do $(':input:enabled')
[01:38:03] <mazzachre> $(':enabled') returns hidden fields that are not disabled... This is not really consistent...
[01:38:31] <mazzachre> $(':input') returns hidden fields
[01:40:42] <jrockjiggz> $('input:visible').not(':disabled');
[01:40:57] <tintin> klawd: It's working now, may be there was some problem with caching
[01:41:57] <klawd> tintinye
[01:42:18] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: It is no problem getting the visible input fields... it is a problem getting the hidden ones... I am just wondering why I need to do $(':input').not(':disabled') in order to get the ones that are enabled, instead of $(':input:enabled')
[01:42:56] <mazzachre> In my eyes those 2 calls should be equal
[01:44:22] <jrockjiggz> mazzachre: so you want all input, except for disabled ones?
[01:45:06] <jrockjiggz> mazzachre: maybe i'm not clear http://jsfiddle.net/VJm4m/1/
[01:46:18] <jrockjiggz> input:enabled works aswell http://jsfiddle.net/VJm4m/2/
[01:48:05] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/Bv3xx/ This is what I am talking about... Why does this only alert test4 and not 1 and 3?
[01:48:55] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: While this do http://jsfiddle.net/Bv3xx/1/
[01:49:23] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/Bv3xx/2/ and this does not again
[01:49:55] <mazzachre> And since I can get it working, it is more a curiousity thing
[01:52:15] <jrockjiggz> mazzachre: most likely a bug, as 1.8.2 works as expected, where 1.7.2 does not
[01:52:36] <jrockjiggz> input:enabled will work though
[01:52:46] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: Ah ok.. but we have not upgraded yet...
[01:52:56] <jrockjiggz> just take off the : at the beginning
[01:52:59] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: But input:enabled does not give me select etc.
[01:53:08] <tintin> How can i skip sending data manually in this json format in .ajax function?
[01:53:16] <jrockjiggz> input:enabled, select:enabled
[01:53:23] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3985941
[01:53:23] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: I currently just do the .not(':disabled')
[01:53:34] <tintin> data: { name: "John", location: "Boston" }
[01:53:43] <jrockjiggz> or: $(':input').filter(':enabled');
[01:53:52] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: That last one does not work
[01:54:04] <tintin> The form can be a big form , then collecting data for each input type and making data: would be tedious
[01:54:11] <tintin> Can anyone answer my questions?
[01:54:19] <jrockjiggz> mazzachre: yea i guess not
[01:54:24] <klawd> tintin: you searching for .serialize?
[01:54:25] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: That is the funny thing... .not(':disabled') returns different result than .filter(':enabled') :)
[01:54:49] <jrockjiggz> at least they fixed it :)
[01:54:54] <mazzachre> yes
[01:55:28] <mazzachre> So eventually, when I can convince the customer to upgrade jQuery I can clean up the code... :p
[01:55:45] <jrockjiggz> its' pretty insignificant
[01:55:49] <tintin> klawd: data: $('#id_form').serialize() , is it?
[01:55:56] <klawd> tintin: yes
[01:56:15] <xec_> tintin: if you're just sending a form post via ajax, you can have a look at http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[01:57:52] <tintin> klawd: No
[01:58:08] <tintin> klawd: form.serialize() returns value in this format, single=Single&multiple=Multiple&multiple=Multiple3&check=check2&radio=radio1
[01:58:35] <tintin> klawd: but in .ajax() , the data: is in {a:1,b:2} in this json format
[01:58:45] <xec_> tintin: the data: option does the same
[01:59:11] <xec_> tintin: it also takes a string in the format that .serialize() provides
[01:59:23] <jrockjiggz> serializeArray() will return an object which you can encode into json
[01:59:48] <jrockjiggz> data: $(this).serializeArray()
[01:59:50] <tintin> xec_: How are you sure?
[02:00:11] <xec_> tintin: you can try it and see, or read the docs. see ?ajax
[02:00:12] <bot-t> tintin, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:00:15] <tintin> jrockjiggz: [..] and json = {.. } are not same format
[02:01:45] <xec_> tintin: copypaste from the part about the data option: "[data] is converted to a query string, if not already a string"
[02:05:35] <tintin> When using success: function(data) { in .ajax() function, then what is the expected format of this data that server sends?
[02:06:49] <xec_> tintin: it's a js object. the structure depends on what the server sends you
[02:07:13] <tintin> What is the expected format from server?
[02:07:52] <xec_> tintin: what server :P
[02:08:10] <xec_> tintin: just console.dir(data) and see for yourself ;)
[02:08:52] <tintin> xec_: apache server, php server sided language
[02:08:56] <devswap> can anyone confirm that $('.icon1').animate({opacity: 1}, 1, 'linear'); is valid please
[02:09:33] <tintin> Is there any expected format of that data in success: function(data){ .. that jquery expects from server sided language?
[02:10:02] <tintin> Or can php send any format of data in success: function(dat) { .. ?
[02:10:26] <xec_> tintin: you *can* basically send whatever you want, i believe, but json is popular
[02:10:43] <tintin> ok
[02:10:56] <xec_> tintin: if you set the proper headers jquery will convert it to a js object
[02:11:39] <seutje> Tim-_-: The data returned from the server, formatted according to the dataType parameter
[02:12:01] <seutje> oh he left, sry, Tim-_-
[02:12:20] <anli> I need to check if an element is visible in a tab that is currently not the selected one (jquery ui tabs), .is(':visible') seems to give me false
[02:12:41] <amirite> are there any decent frameworks for managing js complexity as app scales
[02:12:46] <amirite> i tried angular and it's a piece of shit
[02:13:31] <anli> Trying element.css('display') != 'none' instead
[02:13:56] <Trisox> :-)
[02:18:52] <jrockjiggz> anli: you can also consider.. (':hidden').length == 0
[02:25:07] <yannickoo> Hey guys, can anybody tell me how I can tab them correctly? http://jsfiddle.net/zfxUD/
[02:25:27] <Palanivel> Gud afternoon......i wanna small clarification.. simple thing........i created 5 page forms at first time with the help of jquery, when ever am clicking(firing  the event to saving data) continue button with help of jquery am showing next page without saving ajax response . and then if clicking suddenly next page continue button it's not firing the event to saving the data...waiting for...
[02:25:29] <Palanivel> ...response....
[02:25:29] <zirak> A, jquery lore question if I may: Why is jQuery.fn named thusly?
[02:26:03] <seutje> it's short, to the point
[02:26:04] <zirak> fn isn't a great name for a prototype alias. Why was it chosen?
[02:26:08] <devswap> I have created this jsfiddle which works fine http://jsfiddle.net/devswap/684G5/ but when on my site it doesnt work - can anyone think of a reason why this could be?
[02:26:11] <seutje> fkin jQuery!
[02:26:28] <zirak> But why fn and not, say, pt? fn brings connotations of functions.
[02:26:48] <seutje> that's essentially what you put on there
[02:26:52] <Palanivel> if any one known.Please help me
[02:29:06] <bigkevmcd> zirak: am sure if it was pt and not fn, someone with a nick like kariz would pop in here and ask "Why is jQuery.pt named thusly?"
[02:29:27] <zirak> bigkevmcd: And then you could have said, "it's short for prototype"
[02:29:46] <zirak> Not "because you put functions there". Which isn't all of it
[02:30:10] <bigkevmcd> zirak: it's kinda like asking "Why is the Earth called the Earth?", it's not gonna change any time soon
[02:30:44] <zirak> bigkevmcd: But "earth" is a historical name. jQuery.fn was a name chosen specifically. Yeah, it won't change, but was it just randomly chosen, or was there logic behind it?
[02:31:00] <zirak> And earth is pretty much made of earth.
[02:31:06] <bigkevmcd> zirak: that's hardly true
[02:31:13] <bigkevmcd> zirak: and demonstrably so
[02:31:56] <zirak> bigkevmcd: Dude, this isn't a question of semantics or naming in human history. It's just whether or not there's a specific reason behind calling it jQuery.fn
[02:32:05] <bigkevmcd> history
[02:32:21] <zirak> So, it was first called jQuery.fn because of historical reasons?
[02:32:26] <zirak> Which didn't exist then?
[02:34:10] <gf3> Likely because $.fn containsâ€¦ functions
[02:34:20] <Cork> zirak: .fn is a name standards that most frameworks use
[02:34:30] <Cork> so jquery just followed suite
[02:34:44] <Cork> or at least used
[02:34:47] <zirak> gf3: It also contains variables.
[02:34:51] <Cork> not sure if thats true anymore
[02:34:53] <zirak> Cork: Which frameworks use that?
[02:35:12] <gf3> zirak: Variables can contain functions
[02:35:20] <Cork> zirak: prototype and yahoos framework used to use it at least
[02:35:29] <gf3> Cork: That's not true
[02:35:43] <zirak> gf3: Yes, obviously...but you know what I mean, and I know what I mean, so I thought I could skip that
[02:35:48] <Trisox> http://blog.mostlystatic.com/2012/06/how-does-fn-work-in-javascript.html
[02:35:58] <zirak> Cork: Really? Neat, I'll check that out
[02:36:03] <dannNiel> Hi. I have this little script. http://pastebin.com/JNuzsVrX - My problem: If i click on the link it says: ReferencError: getImgUrl is not defined. How can i solve this problem?
[02:36:08] <gf3> zirak: Well it's en easy enough connection
[02:36:12] <gf3> fn â†’ functions
[02:36:34] <swe_ET> fn = prototyps is what i have learned
[02:36:39] <Trisox> dannNiel: wy onclick?
[02:36:53] <Trisox> ?on
[02:36:53] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:37:02] <Cork> swe_ET: ya, but thats not the question here
[02:37:09] <zirak> gf3: Yes, I know and thought of that. But that seems lame and possibly not the whole story, so I thought I might ask it here
[02:37:13] <dannNiel> I tried it with on('click' but after this nothing happens
[02:37:19] <Cork> swe_ET: its why its named the name it has
[02:37:43] <rosieres> Just a hint: Codeweavers gives CrossOver licenses ( a WINE fork ) for free away -only today. . . With this IÂ´m able to run Office 2010 ( and a lot of other windows software ) in my linux or mac without digging around in long term configuration scenarios - http://flock.codeweavers.com/
[02:37:54] <dannNiel> Trisox: where does i have to set the .on(), before or after the photoswipe call?
[02:38:11] <Trisox> outside of the functions
[02:38:23] <Trisox> for example before function getImgUrl()
[02:39:06] <gf3> `api on
[02:39:07] <b-ot> gf3, .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:39:26] <zirak> Cork: I can't seem to find fn used to denote anything other than functions in YUI or Prototype
[02:39:30] <amirite> jsfiddle
[02:39:33] <dannNiel> Trisox: tried it before the getImgUrl function, nothing happens
[02:39:37] <amirite> jsfiddle is ghey
[02:39:40] <gf3> zirak: It isn't
[02:39:52] <gf3> zirak: At least Prototype never used it
[02:40:05] <zirak> gf3: So it's really just "because it has functions"?
[02:40:12] <Trisox> what version of jquery dannNiel
[02:40:16] <zirak> That's a bit...anticlimatic
[02:40:55] <gf3> It's terse and descriptive
[02:41:11] <dannNiel> Trisox: 1.8.* - What should i do within the on() if it works? window.location.href = .. to point the user to the url?
[02:41:58] <dannNiel> within on() it says: ReferenceError: getElementsByClassName is not defined
[02:42:26] <dannNiel> http://pastebin.com/5dVbSQEh
[02:43:08] <gf3> dannNiel: getElementsByClassName is a method of Element or document
[02:43:16] <Cork> zirak: seem to have mixed it up, i know i've seein it usedin another framework

[02:43:29] <Cork> zirak: but might have been they've taken after jquery
[02:43:32] <gf3> Cork: Perhaps zepto
[02:44:15] <Cork> no, i don't think so
[02:44:42] <zirak> Cork: IIRC Ender does that
[02:45:46] <Cork> hmm ya that might have been it
[02:46:04] <Trisox> dannNiel: try something like http://pastebin.com/index/5dVbSQEh
[02:46:18] <Trisox> sorry
[02:46:31] <gf3> Cork: I meant perhaps you were thinking of Zepto
[02:46:32] <Trisox> http://pastebin.com/Z4PZVTaP
[02:46:36] <gf3> Because it definitely does
[02:46:51] <Cork> fya i know, but no zepto wasn't the framework i though of
[02:46:57] <Cork> *ya,
[02:47:04] <Trisox> you can also remove the getimgul function if you wanned
[02:47:11] <Trisox> and put it in the onclick
[02:47:19] <zirak> Well, thanks for the chat. Now another small mystery is solved.
[02:47:45] <swe_ET> ?position
[02:47:45] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[02:48:10] <dannNiel> Trisox: whats new on your snippet?
[02:48:31] <Trisox> well use of jquery not
[02:48:37] <Trisox> get element etc
[02:48:43] <Trisox> makes it more readable and shorter
[02:48:56] <Trisox> and removed the onclick to the on() click
[02:49:15] <Trisox> id you want you can shorten it a lot
[02:49:43] <Trisox> what your doing with imgUrl?
[02:50:00] <Trisox> in this snipit not much..
[02:50:49] <dannNiel> i think you have give me the wrong pastebin url
[02:51:06] <Trisox> http://pastebin.com/Z4PZVTaP ?
[02:51:33] <dannNiel> now i got it and give it a try, 1sec
[02:51:37] <Trisox> like i said you can shorten it
[02:52:23] <Trisox> but i dont know your other code so no idea what the getimgurl function does
[02:52:38] <anli> Is there a complete event in the dataTable plugin?
[02:52:38] <olliejudge> can anyone see anything glaringly broken with this snippet, it doesn't seem to be working for me: https://gist.github.com/7f46d953eba5184204e1
[02:53:36] <Trisox> 	jQuery('#deliveryOptions').css('top', jQuery(this).closest('.package').position().top    );
[02:55:15] <hooloovoo> git -h
[02:55:17] <hooloovoo> wops
[02:55:55] <dannNiel> Trisox: the on() doesn't work, i always get redirected to #
[02:56:06] <Trisox> ah lol 1 sec
[02:56:32] <Trisox>     $(".ps-photo-download").on("click", function(e){ e.preventDefault();         getImgUrl();     });
[02:56:48] <Trisox> you have to prevent the default action of the link
[02:57:17] <Trisox> ? preventDefault
[02:57:17] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:57:38] <Trisox> witch is going to url ( the # )  in this case
[02:58:51] <Trisox> dannNiel: then it should work
[02:59:46] <dannNiel> Trisox: i have already added, now it works. thanks for your help
[03:00:05] <Trisox> no problem have fun dev'ing
[03:03:11] <anli> I have used $('form').submit(function () {});, if I return false, the form is not posted (as expected), but the handler will not execute if I try to post the form again, any ideas?
[03:08:07] <dannNiel> Trisox: what is the best solution to open the img link in a new window?
[03:09:09] <dannNiel> within the on()
[03:14:22] <Trisox> target"_blank" on a link?
[03:14:26] <Trisox> :p
[03:14:27] <Trisox> dunno
[03:15:13] <Trisox> anli: read up on return false ;)
[03:15:46] <anli> I already know about it
[03:16:01] <anli> I think you were the one advising me
[03:16:21] <Trisox> no i didnt
[03:16:36] <anli> Can I use return false on a <input type="submit"? seems like the form onsubmit handler is something I cant use, will collide with something on this particular webpage
[03:16:37] <anli> Ah, ok
[03:16:39] <anli> Sorry then
[03:16:49] <anli> Well, I know why to not use it, but I also know why to use it
[03:17:16] <Trisox> wy not prevent the default action ?
[03:17:21] <Darkstar1> I have an image button on a page. I am completely new to query and javascript but I'm being told it's the only way to achieve this: I want to be able to scroll a div downward when I click or mouseover the button
[03:17:40] <Trisox> ?scrollTo
[03:17:41] <bot-t> Trisox, ScrollTo - jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[03:17:43] <anli> Because return false is shorter to type/read
[03:18:04] <Trisox> return false is not the same as preventDefault();
[03:18:04] <gf3> Also scrollTop
[03:18:09] <anli> I know
[03:18:11] <Trisox> indeed
[03:18:15] <Trisox> gf3:
[03:18:18] <Darkstar1> Ok thanks
[03:18:46] <Trisox> Darkstar1: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[03:19:24] <Trisox> anli: wy you want to return false?
[03:19:37] <Trisox> i mean there must be a logic behind it an idea
[03:19:42] <anli> Its shorter to read/type
[03:20:01] <Trisox> no wy not submit the form?
[03:20:11] <anli> Some requirements are not met
[03:20:21] <Trisox> like validation?\
[03:20:29] <anli> yes
[03:20:49] <Trisox> if your using jquery validate you dont need return false
[03:20:57] <anli> But I do not use jquery validate
[03:20:57] <Trisox> and it might be better to disable the button
[03:20:57] <amirite> whats a good js framework like angular but not so obtuse and retarded
[03:21:09] <anli> If the user finds a disabled button he/she will not know why
[03:21:18] <Trisox> styling..
[03:21:22] <anli> I am not in for advise
[03:21:31] <Trisox> oke then good luck ;)
[03:22:18] <Trisox> i think you approach is wrong when it comes to validation or your not telling everything
[03:22:35] <Trisox> best practice is the way to go on validation for sure
[03:23:29] <anli> I am already using a validation framework, without actually wanting to
[03:23:38] <softmanpetro> hi all !
[03:23:57] <softmanpetro> I click on a Jquery tab and I would like to get the li class for that tab
[03:24:15] <anli> right click and inspect
[03:24:19] <softmanpetro> inside $(  "#prodtabs" ).bind( "tabsselect", function(event, ui) {
[03:24:36] <softmanpetro> alert($(ui).hasClass("apply")) did not helped
[03:24:50] <anli> Dont call an id something that implies that there are many of something
[03:24:54] <anli> heh
[03:24:56] <softmanpetro> also $(this) seems to be all the tabs
[03:26:27] <Trisox> $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active" );
[03:26:36] <Trisox> that gets you the active tab
[03:26:44] <Trisox> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-active
[03:27:47] <anli> In which order are form.submit handlers run?
[03:28:04] <anli> Maybe I should just put mine first if not already done
[03:30:03] <softmanpetro> Trisox alert($( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active" ).find('li').hasClass('apply')); I get false whne click on each tav
[03:30:06] <softmanpetro> tab*
[03:30:24] <softmanpetro> but one of the tabs has li with class apply and a inside li also has class apply
[03:34:16] <Trisox> inside will not be selected
[03:35:33] <softmanpetro> so I have the tabs and want to check when click on a tab if it has "apply" class on it
[03:35:44] <Trisox> ah oke
[03:35:58] <softmanpetro> I did maybe I need tabclick instead of tabselect ?
[03:36:01] <Trisox> alert($( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active" ).hasClass('apply'));
[03:36:18] <sh0ne> can I write selector like this " $('h4.fltr g2').find('span') "    if   " <h4 class="fltr g2"><span></span></h4> " ?
[03:36:42] <Trisox> $('h4.fltr.g2').find('span')
[03:36:49] <Trisox> like css
[03:37:07] <sh0ne> Trisox: thank you very much for help
[03:37:10] <Trisox> np
[03:37:15] <softmanpetro> there is a tabclick event instead of tabselect because I want to pre-check that Trisox
[03:38:08] <Trisox> $( ".selector" ).tabs({ event: "click" }).hasClass('apply');
[03:38:13] <Trisox> try that softmanpetro
[03:38:18] <Trisox> never tried it
[03:39:08] <Trisox> time for a smoke brb
[03:39:13] <softmanpetro> with $(  "#prodtabs li a" ).bind( "click",  works Trisox ;)
[03:39:16] <softmanpetro> thx
[03:48:42] <Trisox> softmanpetro: ah oke that would work too indeed
[03:52:23] <devswap> if jquery animation is set to occur on an element, is there a way to stop any other element affecting the state of that element so it has sole access?
[03:52:51] <devswap> basically preventing another function from altering the state of the object
[03:52:57] <Cork> devswap: no
[03:53:07] <Cork> you would have to implement that you're self
[03:53:12] <amirite> why are you the gay
[03:53:23] <devswap> cork: by removing a class by instance
[03:53:37] <Cork> devswap: depends how they find it
[03:53:48] <Cork> if they use a cache variable the class won't matter
[03:54:06] <Cork> basically the functions that modify it needs to check if something is working with it
[03:55:13] <amirite> why is this channel so boring
[03:55:31] <Cork> amirite: cause its a developer channel
[03:55:44] <Cork> it's basically for questions and answers
[03:59:18] <ZCJ> Hi Guys, a quick question. I am new to Jquery and playing around the UI part. When I create a new Accordion or tab menu, I get to have big size fonts and big background area for tab menus. Where does Jquery get the initial(default) values for these properties as I am unable to get it from the ui-all.css file. or should I have my own default .css file?
[04:02:04] <Darkstar1> Don't get how to scroll down :/
[04:04:50] <Trisox> Darkstar1:     $('body').animate({         scrollTop: $('#myid, .orclass')     }, 100); ?
[04:05:09] <tipdbmp> After a page loads and it's content is modified by javascript/jQuery and I try to print it what will get printed?
[04:05:38] <devswap> cork: would you mind having a look at my link and telling me if there is anything you can suggest. http://epm.ozones.co.uk/ - the icons at the top animate in sequence but I also have jquery doing a hover sequence and if you happen to hover over an icon that is being animated and move out then the animation will occur after the sequence has past and I want to remove this
[04:05:40] <tipdbmp> Only the static content or the dynamic / the page that's currently rendered?
[04:05:42] <Trisox> if its in print preview ;)
[04:06:57] <softmanpetro> I have a modal which contains 2 href's with yes and no but when I click in the modal on the no button the link is not followed
[04:08:01] <tipdbmp> tnx Trisox =)
[04:08:02] <devswap> cork: the only thing I can think is if I add a class before and remove it after the animation takes place and to check for that on hover?
[04:08:49] <Trisox> tipdbmp: you can also print a page haha :)
[04:09:03] <tipdbmp> I don't have a printer.
[04:09:09] <Trisox> print a pdf !
[04:09:19] <Trisox> ;)
[04:09:47] <tipdbmp> File/Print Preview is good enough =)
[04:10:08] <Cork> devswap: replace $(".hovericon").hover(function() {}, function() {}) with $('#content').on('mouseenter', '.hovericon', function() {}).on('mouseleave', '.hovericon', function() {})
[04:10:40] <Cork> devswap: and remove that class when the animation happens
[04:11:14] <Trisox> Cork: dont you need to deque the animation /  stop it?
[04:11:19] <Trisox> ?deque
[04:11:22] <bot-t> Trisox, #4423 (Scope of Animation Queue) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4423
[04:11:25] <Darkstar1> Trisox: That animated the window to scroll to the top :?
[04:11:38] <Cork> Trisox: don't think so, cause he wants it to not get triggered, not stop it
[04:11:48] <Trisox> well ah k
[04:12:01] <Mohsen_Hassani> I have some categorized news, I'd like to display the categories using some nice jquery widgets; is there any jquery you introduce me?
[04:12:32] <Trisox> Darkstar1
[04:12:33] <Trisox> $('#clickerelementorwhatever').click(function(){ $(this).animate({         scrollTop: $('body)     }, 100); });
[04:12:49] <devswap> cork: thanks - was just trying something as I didnt think you were still here - was getting the animating function to add a class on starting to animate and removing a class on finishing and then the hover function checks for that class - is that an option?
[04:13:21] <Cork> Trisox: i'm quite sure that scrollTop doesn't take a jquery object
[04:13:51] <Cork> Trisox: unless its just been added
[04:14:03] <Trisox> oh sorry right
[04:14:07] <Trisox> you need postion to it
[04:14:22] <Cork> devswap: yes, but delegated event listeners is better
[04:14:27] <Darkstar1> Trisox: thankx
[04:14:42] <Cork> devswap: its better even if you didn't want to disable it
[04:14:53] <Trisox> $('#clickerelementorwhatever').click(function(){ $(this).animate({         scrollTop: 0     }, 100); }); is to top
[04:18:07] <wiseguysonly> what is the best way to set a variable on the success of $.get that would be available to later function calls
[04:18:37] <Cork> wiseguysonly: if the different $.get can share a scope, that would be the best place
[04:18:42] <Cork> else the global scope
[04:19:15] <Cork> wiseguysonly: though remember that later functions has to be in another execution stack, or they will run before the variable is set
[04:19:33] <Cork> (and it might still be racy(
[04:19:35] <Cork> *)
[04:20:00] <wiseguysonly> Cork: the variable is set on page load, and only changes if a user interacts with an element which triggers $.get
[04:20:33] <wiseguysonly> however that interaction calls setInterval which initiates a periodic function
[04:20:55] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have this problem http://pastebin.com/DZgT8v8b   help?
[04:21:14] <Cork> wiseguysonly: is the setInterval called from the $.get callback?
[04:21:25] <Cork> wiseguysonly: else it will be racy
[04:21:38] <wiseguysonly> unfortunately no. I think I need to figure out a way to do that
[04:21:49] <Cork> Krambiorix: never EVER send strings to setTimeout or setInterval
[04:22:02] <wiseguysonly> I can't afford a race condition and you are correct it will more than likely occur if there is any lag
[04:22:15] <Cork> Krambiorix: use setTimeout(function() { loadTestAndSubmit() }, 2000)
[04:23:33] <Cork> Krambiorix: might be good to say why too
[04:23:54] <Cork> Krambiorix: strings always execute in the global scope, so you lose all inherited or local variables
[04:33:04] <devswap> cork: isnt .on a recent thing - drupal is using 1.5.2
[04:33:25] <Cork> devswap: yes
[04:33:32] <Cork> but you can use .delegate in older versions
[04:33:36] <Cork> ?.delegate
[04:33:37] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:34:06] <Cork> just change place of the selector and event type and you should be good to go
[04:39:04] <d4ndy> hello
[04:40:13] <d4ndy> I want to disable the enter key from submitting the form. Is there something wrong with this code? It doesn't work to stop the submission: $('#cartForm').keyup(function(e) {if (e.which == 13) {return false;}});
[04:44:07] <devswap> cork: am I correct in thinking if I do the addClass at the end of an animate chain it will run it at the start and not at the end of the animate sequence? ie $('.icon2').delay(2200).animate({opacity: 1}, 2000, 'linear').animate({opacity: 0.5}, 2000, 'linear').addClass("hovericon");
[04:45:12] <devswap> ie I was thinking that $('.icon2').removeClass("hovericon").delay(2200).animate({opacity: 1}, 2000, 'linear').animate({opacity: 0.5}, 2000, 'linear').addClass("hovericon"); would work
[04:46:15] <Cork> devswap: no it will run synchronously with your selector
[04:46:28] <Cork> devswap: animate is async and runs timer based
[04:48:44] <devswap> cork: how can I force the animate to remove the class on starting and then add it again on completion - is that possible?
[04:49:20] <Cork> devswap: start would have to be synchronously, but that shouldn't be a problem
[04:49:33] <Cork> end should happen in the animate callback
[04:49:38] <Cork> ?.animate
[04:49:38] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[04:49:53] <Cork> [complete] <--
[04:51:13] <chachan> hi guys, how could I create an object using a syntaxis like: {$('input[placeholder="min"]').eq(0).attr('name').split('min')[1]: 0}
[04:51:27] <Cork> devswap: so var icon = $('.icon2'); setTimeout(function() { icon.removeClass("hovericon").animate({opacity: 1}, 2000, 'linear').animate({opacity: 0.5}, 2000, 'linear', function() { icon.addClass("hovericon"); }); }, 2200)
[04:52:02] <Cork> chachan: var obj = {}; obj[$('input[placeholder="min"]').eq(0).attr('name').split('min')[1]] = 0;
[04:56:25] <devswap> cork: that seems to be working - thanks alot. I was expecting firebug to show that the class had been removed and then see it reappear but it seems to be there constantly, however the code is working and doing as expected - is that normal?
[04:57:16] <Cork> devswap: check so firebug is configured to show live updates
[04:58:38] <Cork> devswap: cause it should be visible there
[05:03:42] <Desproges> Hi, I made an ajax request  $("form").submit(); which reload the form, including a part of <script type="javascript"> code, and I get the following error : $ is not defined . Do you have an idea ?
[05:04:10] <ravenzz> what the error says
[05:04:14] <ravenzz> :)
[05:04:15] <hooloovoo> Desproges: are you including jquery?
[05:04:21] <Knuxgen> hooloovoo: my idea, too
[05:04:27] <Desproges> it's already included in the first page
[05:04:31] <hooloovoo> Desproges: and what other frameworks are you including?
[05:04:37] <Desproges> should I add a script src="" inside the div ?
[05:04:40] <Knuxgen> what does it mean on "the first page"
[05:04:44] <Desproges> only jquery
[05:04:55] <Desproges> I mean, I m on a page with a form
[05:05:03] <hooloovoo> Knuxgen: type jQuery in the console and see what you get
[05:05:06] <hooloovoo> no wait
[05:05:07] <Desproges> (with 3 form in fact, in each subtab)
[05:05:09] <hooloovoo> Desproges* =P
[05:06:07] <anew> <%=  %> what are these tags in js... some sort of template, but i forgot.... anyone know ?
[05:06:30] <Desproges> I have something like this : https://gist.github.com/3986699
[05:07:05] <hooloovoo> Desproges: i still don't see you including jquery there =/
[05:10:25] <Knuxgen> Desproges: paste the whole code
[05:12:33] <Desproges> see https://gist.github.com/3986699 : the 1st page is like that, and the "data" returned is the result.php
[05:13:47] <devswap> cork: sorry to be a pain but I have that working but the animate in seems to ignore the time - ie it changes state instantly to illuminate but then does fade properly back to its normal state - can you think why this would be?
[05:14:28] <Desproges> and that's really weird, because The first time I load that container, the code is executed correctly.
[05:16:12] <Cork> devswap: what causes the color change?
[05:16:59] <devswap> its the animate opacity which should be over 2000 but seems more like 1
[05:17:02] <Cork> devswap: if its from the removal of the class, that's the cause
[05:18:16] <Cork> anyway gtg
[05:18:50] <devswap> cork: could be - thanks alot for your help this morning
[05:25:21] <Darkstar1> Trisox: Thanks for your help again

[05:30:01] <chachan> Cork, it worked, thanks!
[05:30:05] <devswap> is there a function I can call to load another function ie settimeout().loadfunction("x");
[05:35:23] <seutje> ?xy @ devswap
[05:35:23] <bot-t> devswap, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[05:35:35] <Qdest> How can I use a function outside the scope it's defined in?
[05:36:17] <Qdest> function myFunc(args) {} ... ).mouseleave({ myFunc(myArgs) <-- doesn't work as it doesn't recognize myFunc
[05:37:03] <seutje> Qdest: leak it out of the scope or pass a reference around
[05:37:13] <Qdest> How could I do that?
[05:38:09] <devswap> seutje: I have a function called animateicons which has a number of things running within it and at the end I wish to call animateicons so that it creates an infinate loop. The last command is settimeout and I am unsure how to call animateicons following it running (hoping that made sense)
[05:38:29] <seutje> Qdest: stick it on an object in a common scope
[05:38:57] <Qdest> seutje: The function itself uses vars that's subject to the scope it's within
[05:39:55] <kelye> hello, can someone please help me with a hint ? ... I have an event that triggers 2 ajax loads ... how can I make sure the result handler of the second request is executed only after the first finished ?

[07:34:41] <m1435> hi guys
[07:35:05] <m1435> i need a jquery ui 1.8.24 build using ui-smoothness?
[07:35:11] <m1435> anybody can help?
[07:35:24] <Saaether> go to the jqueryui website and download it?
[07:35:52] <m1435> the builder only works for version 1.9.1
[07:36:21] <m1435> but i need 1.8.24
[07:37:53] <m1435> no idea?

[07:39:57] <m1435> thank u
[07:45:17] <Heather_> can I apply custom plugins on elements using on() e.g $(document).on('selector', function(){ $(this).customPlugin(); });
[07:46:38] <Josh> Harry Potter !
[07:46:54] <grafi> on selector?
[07:48:12] <Heather_> long shot got this custom plugin i want to "assign" to dynamically added content without having to create additional script
[07:49:39] <faraway> Heather_: there is no "dom change" event that is supported cross browser right now, so you need to write a helper function that will apply plugins to the dynamically added content.
[07:50:12] <Heather_> okay ty
[07:50:31] <grafi> probably easy anyways, just $('selectors').customPlugin(); whenever you have finished loading, no?
[07:51:19] <kelye> how can I specify a method of an object as handler for .on() ?
[07:51:36] <faraway> Heather_: but you could create a helper obejct that stores your "selectors to plugin intializers" and then everytime you add content call myHelperObject.intializePlugins() or something like that, then you have it centralized. or do it with a custom event
[07:51:47] <kelye> like $('.class').on('click', object.method) ?
[07:52:26] <faraway> Heather_: like .on("initplugins", ..... ) and when you add content call elementWhereContentWasAdded.trigger("initiplugins")
[07:52:46] <Heather_> hmm okay
[07:54:26] <omolio> Hi. How can I get the width of an element ignoring it's children dimensions. Means the I want to calculate the width like there were no children.
[07:54:39] <faraway> Heather_: there are/were plugins that mimic the dom change event by modifying jquery ... but with a really bad performance
[07:54:54] <seutje> omolio: hide the children, grab the width, show the children?
[07:55:27] <seutje> $el.children().hide(); width = $el.width(); $el.children().css('display', '');?
[07:55:41] <omolio> seutje: unfortunately that doesn't work. It calculates the width including the children.
[07:55:53] <wunderCatze> omolio: take the CSS atribute?, but not the compute one?
[07:55:53] <seutje> oh rly?
[07:56:40] <omolio> seutje: one moment, I give it one more try with children() instead of picking the children one by one
[07:58:49] <seutje> omolio: http://jsfiddle.net/XGgDL/
[08:00:33] <omolio> seutje: thanks children() was the fix!
[08:08:05] <AL13N_work> i want to execute a code when a new certain new DOM element appears... with the .on({},'selector'), i tried 'ready' event, but that didn't work

[08:12:28] <scar> whats a good way to deal with sliders (such a nivo) for non-js folks? it stacks all the images. im not trying to get a slider w/o javascript.
[08:13:27] <seutje> scar: scrolling div?
[08:14:18] <scar> seutje: hm. that would work for a static-sized slider, which would be most of my uses. any thoughts for a dynamic-sized slider, with images of different sizes?
[08:15:25] <scar> seutje: my height would only change, not width of the slides.
[08:15:47] <seutje> scar: why wouldn't that work?
[08:15:58] <seutje> is it a requirement that the largest image fits in the container?
[08:16:14] <seutje> or can it require scrolling to view it in its entirety?
[08:16:29] <scar> seutje: no, but i would have to set the height and width with CSS wouldnt i, in order to have scrolling?
[08:17:01] <seutje> scar: well, u'd only have to set minimum dimensions
[08:17:43] <seutje> scar: it's either that or max dimensions on the slides, right?
[08:18:01] <scar> seutje: well, if i set min dimensions on the height, then it wont scroll
[08:18:30] <seutje> good point
[08:29:55] <olliejudge> Apart from the API, what is a good quick read for a primer on jQuery, I stopped keeping tabs on it a couple years back and need to get back into it any advice?

[09:09:24] <softmanpetro> there ia any " tab ready " to wait for a tab to be able to manipulate it ?
[09:10:05] <softmanpetro> in document ready $('#prodtabs').tabs('select', $('#prodtabs a[href="#tabs-'+defaulttab+'"]').parent().index()); is not selecting what I expect
[09:10:13] <softmanpetro> but in chrome console it works perfect
[09:10:23] <softmanpetro> any ideea please ?

[09:11:16] <softmanpetro> console simple select 2nd tab
[09:11:23] <NoiseEee> softmanpetro: the first thing I wonder is what is / where is 'defaulttab' getting set?
[09:11:31] <motaka2> pifantastic: No
[09:12:38] <softmanpetro> is in a <script section in my php and if I alert it I see is 1 or 2 depends on the logic in the php

[09:17:52] <ciack404> is it possible to embed with iframe a youtube video to a jquery mobile project wrapped with phonegap build? (I'm testing on android)
[09:19:15] <motaka2> This code doesnt work for me in IE7/8. Does any one has any idea? http://pastebin.com/hqCQv4fh
[09:20:50] <NoiseEee> motaka2: what happens? whats the error?
[09:23:34] <softmanpetro> NoiseEee... starting to create the fiddle I noticed I initiate the tabs outside the document ready :( :)
[09:23:39] <softmanpetro> solved the issue
[09:23:42] <softmanpetro> thx
[09:23:52] <NoiseEee> sweet. np
[09:25:14] <motaka2> NoiseEee: I dont know how to check for the error , I had a debugger for IE, I forgot the name , but it doesnt popup on this page , means that it doesnt find any error
[09:27:09] <Saaether> motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/QMfyR/1/ how about something like this?
[09:28:18] <_sab0t> is the usage of dumbFormState not just $('#form').dumbFormState()
[09:28:26] <motaka2> Well different parts of the code live on differnt places it is difficult to gather them all in one place - while the addresse should be fixed too
[09:28:56] <NoiseEee> motaka2: what Saaether is proposing is monitoring your <select> for change event, not monitoring <options> to see if they've been clicked
[09:29:03] <NoiseEee> and whatever you typed above doesn't really mean anything
[09:29:55] <motaka2> NoiseEee: Ah thanks for change it works , but it works just one time thats why I changed it to click
[09:30:20] <Saaether> ? it doesnt only work 1 time
[09:30:22] <bot-t> Saaether, .one() - Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[09:30:40] <Saaether> whoops
[09:31:00] <motaka2> yes, if you try to reselect for example google.com it wont open once again
[09:31:06] <Saaether> sure it does
[09:31:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can anyone solve this little problem? http://pastebin.com/aW0PuCzA - The capital letters represent what's missing...
[09:31:18] <Saaether> if its not working for you its most likely IE blocking repeated popups
[09:34:14] <motaka2> Saaether: The same in FF with your code, I mean what I need is not change I need click , I know it works with change
[09:34:52] <_sab0t> ecky--ptang-zoob: I kind of suck at jq but http://pastebin.com/mYJGN2rd
[09:36:47] <Saaether> my code does what you're looking for... tested in IE, chrome and firefox... dont see what the problem is
[09:37:20] <motaka2> Saaether: I really need it to work with click event not change event
[09:37:47] <motaka2> Saaether: check this version http://jsfiddle.net/QMfyR/1/
[09:38:18] <_sab0t> dumbFormState re-populates my form's state properly unless a PHP controller routes back to the page...does anyone have any idea why it'd be selectively working like this?
[09:38:28] <Saaether> you just linked me my own code?
[09:38:37] <_sab0t> so if I navigate to the page via anchor or something, it works fine
[09:39:03] <Saaether> if you really want click then change it to click http://jsfiddle.net/QMfyR/2/
[09:39:44] <Saaether> but that doesnt work in all browsers
[09:40:48] <Saaether> whereas on change works perfectly
[09:43:03] <motaka2> Saaether: I need your second code to work in IE, change is not useful to me , Is there a soloution to make on.click work in IE7/8 ? Thats What I am looking for
[09:47:44] <motaka2> NoiseEee: Don't you know any solution ?

[10:21:38] <keirlav87> is there a recommended or best practice way of retrieving session info from the server, such as if it's non-sensitive info should you place it as the value of a hidden input on the page so you can check it from the dom, or should you make a request to the server and store the values you need in a variable?
[10:22:32] <kickandr_> keirlav87: I've had good luck with global objects attached to the window element

[10:28:14] <Aicasn> is there a way to tell the validation plugin not to require the protocol ("http://") in a url?  web browsers will assume http:// so i would like the validator to do the same
[10:28:18] <kvevert> tipbdmp: var opt = $("<option>").val("some value") to create such an option, then maybe opt.appendTo(), or $("select").append(opt)
[10:28:21] <Saaether> always use on() when dealing with dynamically added triggers
[10:28:35] <Aicasn> enough of our customers will wonder why "www.theirwebsite.com" is not a "valid url"
[10:29:35] <faraway> ilriso: jquery selector only reflect the state at the time you do the query if you do $(".some-class").click(...) the handler only applyed to the elements that have this class right at the moment you do this call
[10:30:34] <ilriso> cool
[10:30:42] <ilriso> thanks for the help :)
[10:30:42] <faraway> ilriso: the $(element).on("click",".some-class", ....) listens to all click events on the given element, and if the ".some-class" selector is matching the event handler is called
[10:31:19] <ilriso> it's "broader"
[10:31:25] <faraway> ilriso: if you write$(document).on("click", ".some-class", ..) you are save because the document does not change

[10:40:53] <motaka2> Saaether: Why do u insist on something which does not work for me
[10:40:55] <motaka2> ?
[10:40:59] <kickandr_> you could, I've done as much.  I've also piped JSON directly into the view (easy because my current app is in node).  Jade example, but when the view loads I could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/MwQLW/1/
[10:41:00] <Saaether> why? you proposed an issue, the code i wrote does exactly what you asked for
[10:41:11] <kickandr_> keirlav87: ^
[10:41:13] <Saaether> why does it NEED to be click?
[10:41:17] <Darkstar1> pls I'm desperate?
[10:41:26] <hlve> Darkstar1, relax
[10:41:32] <hlve> I'm working on it, one sec.
[10:42:29] <motaka2> Saaether: cause it the use may close the opened window and then return back to theparent page and he reCLICKS on letes say edit option and thinks he can just edit once
[10:43:02] <motaka2> Saaether: for months it was CHANGE, now I have to move to CLICK
[10:43:38] <NoiseEee> https://www.google.ca/search?q=ie+option+onclick+is+not+working&aq=1&oq=ie+option+onclick&sugexp=chrome,mod=0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 @ motaka
[10:43:42] <NoiseEee> google for solutions.
[10:44:01] <Darkstar1> hive. Thanks.. I have my boss essentially screaming that it's broken :/ and he wants it fixed in the next 10 mins
[10:44:09] <motaka2> NoiseEee: it more than two ours I am googling
[10:44:18] <keirlav87> if i had doc ready events that relied on data fetched from the server, what would be my best option just an ajax call with async set to false?
[10:44:23] <NoiseEee> motaka2: so you know its a problem.  search for workarounds.
[10:44:57] <NoiseEee> motaka2: https://www.google.ca/search?q=ie+option+onclick+workaround
[10:45:00] <awc737> can I pass $this as an argument into this funciton
[10:45:00] <motaka2> NoiseEee: I don't know what to say
[10:45:03] <awc737> jQuery('.form-validate').ready(function() {
[10:45:06] <hlve> Darkstar1: $('.text_area').animate({ scrollTop: "300px" });
[10:45:07] <hlve> o_O?
[10:45:14] <hlve> Er. one sec.
[10:45:16] <awc737> so I can refer to the form it finds as this
[10:45:36] <hlve> Darkstar1: $('.text_area').animate({ scrollTop: "300px" }, "slow");
[10:45:37] <hlve> ^^
[10:45:39] <Darkstar1> hlve: I need it to scroll down by a certain amount each time until it gets to the end
[10:46:00] <Saaether> motaka2 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3341740/click-event-for-option-doesnt-work-in-ie has a proposed solution you can try to adapt for your code
[10:46:07] <hlve> you need to show me what you're trying to do
[10:46:10] <hlve> words mean nothing
[10:46:11] <hlve> lol
[10:46:47] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: so you want to scroll down by an additional 300px each time?
[10:47:18] <Darkstar1> hlve: too late to knock up a JSfiddle but here's the function: http://fpaste.org/jJXc/
[10:47:23] <raj> I need a talk with someone experienced!
[10:47:45] <hlve> raj, ask your question.
[10:47:49] <hlve> Darkstar1, one sec.
[10:47:51] <motaka2> Saaether: Thank you, I have already tested the solutions in that page I arrived to no results
[10:47:52] <raj> shoky, around?
[10:47:54] <NoiseEee> raj: wear a condom, always
[10:48:02] <raj> NoiseEee, that's terrible advice
[10:48:04] <hlve> raj: 7 inches, wide.
[10:48:21] <hlve> Darkstar1: wrap your 300px in quotations
[10:48:22] <hlve> plz
[10:48:28] <Darkstar1> ok
[10:49:16] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: you need a reference to the current scroll position, scrolltop 300px is always going to move the scroll bar to 300px from the top of the window
[10:49:35] <keirlav87> i'll make you a fiddle
[10:50:04] <hlve> Dawh
[10:50:07] <hlve> I was working on it :s
[10:50:17] <hlve> go ahead. we'll both see how we did this :p
[10:51:26] <Darkstar1> nah didn't work
[10:51:38] <Darkstar1> If you have team viewer I can give you access to the code
[10:53:22] <Darkstar1> hlve: thx very much. I appreciate this. I was supposed to have gone home 3 hours ago but I can't leave until this scroll image button is done :/
[10:59:21] <batmanbond3dd> Can someone explain why this doesn't work in IE7
[10:59:22] <batmanbond3dd> http://jsfiddle.net/LvmjP/
[11:00:15] <hlve> Darkstar1, just be another minute or two
[11:00:24] <batmanbond3dd> never mind, needed a zoom
[11:01:23] <raj> So if I have a singlepage website, am I supposed to write all the html to be added (for example when a link is clicked) within the js file?
[11:02:12] <NoiseEee> raj: or coming via XHR / backend
[11:02:42] <raj> NoiseEee, but I need the js to manipulate the DOM anyway
[11:03:05] <raj> for example, if I'm using jqui widgets
[11:03:23] <NoiseEee> yes, you need JS to manipulate the DOM.  the html can come from wherever
[11:04:14] <raj> but my conversation with abjorn yesterday seemed to insinuate that it would be sloppy to do it via xhr retrieving the html
[11:04:36] <FrozenFire> Is there a simple way to get list of attributes on an element that follow a particular wildcard format?
[11:04:47] <FrozenFire> I need attributes of the format data-foo-*
[11:04:57] <FrozenFire> I need to know what * is, and what the value of that attribute is
[11:05:20] <NoiseEee> raj: but often the HTML needed can't be set until certain actions/settings are done
[11:05:20] <keirlav87> lol mines not working with scrolltop - but if you already have something working with scroll top you should see what im doing - rather than just setting scrolltop to a flat 300 px each time, store a reference to the current scrolltop value, then add 300 to it on each click and use that for your animation - here's an example using height instead of scrolltop - http://jsfiddle.net/8Hhaf/22/
[11:05:47] <Darkstar1> hlve: nvm now. No need to rush. I'm already in for a talking tomorrow morning. Still can't leave until it's done though now :/
[11:06:17] <batmanbond3dd> I am trying to scale a parent div with plenty of child.  The bounders of the parent div seem to scale but the child divs don't scale.
[11:06:20] <raj> FrozenFire, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4187032/get-list-of-data-attributes-using-javascript-jquery
[11:06:37] <batmanbond3dd> Works in IE7, IE9, Chrome but won't work in IE8
[11:06:37] <raj> NoiseEee, agreed
[11:07:02] <batmanbond3dd> any ideas why IE8 doesn't work but all other browsers do
[11:07:04] <raj> that's why I was wondering if I should just be creating the dom elements via js instead of loading the html
[11:08:11] <NoiseEee> raj: whatever is more maintainable.
[11:08:19] <NoiseEee> raj: you might also want to look into templating
[11:08:25] <raj> html is definitely more maintainable
[11:08:38] <raj> NoiseEee, I wish wish wish I did templating at this point (angular or backbone)
[11:08:43] <FrozenFire> raj, That has limited browser support, I believe. (the data attribute thing)
[11:08:43] <raj> but I'm too far in I think
[11:09:26] <raj> FrozenFire, you can test http://jsfiddle.net/yijiang/WVfSg/
[11:09:31] <raj> in whatever browsers
[11:09:54] <raj> I'm not sure on browser limitations offhand though, sorry
[11:10:53] <hlve> Darkstar1, I'll msg you as soon as this is done. getting sidetracked
[11:10:53] <hlve> lol
[11:10:54] <hlve> sorry
[11:11:12] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: here's a revision of your paste - let me know if it works http://fpaste.org/pepm/
[11:11:29] <raj> NoiseEee, would it be any more difficult to make my regular, multi-page, link-click-page-refreshing site into a site that creates its dom via js, than to modify my site into one that uses angularjs?
[11:11:31] <Darkstar1> keirlav87: Cheers I'll try
[11:12:13] <NoiseEee> raj: beats me.  you'd have a whole learning curve of angularjs etc though
[11:12:15] <keirlav87> i think i might have an extra }); in there though so be careful lol
[11:12:44] <TelFiRE> Why use $(window).resize(function() { instead of just window.onresize ?
[11:12:59] <keirlav87> raj: are you thinking about turning a site into a single page site?
[11:13:01] <TelFiRE> does the jquery version have some browser compatibility that the js one doesn't, or somethin?
[11:13:15] <raj> yes
[11:14:26] <keirlav87> me too, what framework / library are you leaning towards at the minute? I keep getting lost in the comparisons of them
[11:15:19] <raj> what're the choices?
[11:15:34] <raj> I've only read up on backbone.js
[11:15:59] <garciawebdev> keirlav87, I started trying Craft.js, though not used it on production yet
[11:16:11] <garciawebdev> seems a good deal
[11:16:20] <raj> I believe angular.js is similar to backbone though
[11:17:23] <keirlav87> there's a swathe of them, the impression i have at the minute is that they range from backbone which is very light and a sort of take or leave it approach with the expentancy that you will resolve anything that is not covered by the library by yourself, to the very strict such as ember.js which demands you follow their approach right down to your file naming conventions
[11:17:41] <keirlav87> i've not read anything on craft yet though - i'll give that a look thanks
[11:18:03] <raj> keirlav87, do you have a completed website?
[11:18:38] <Darkstar1> keirlav87: Sort of works. When you reach the end and go back up scrollposs is not reset
[11:19:23] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: you need to set another event that will reset scrollpos - at what point would you like this to happen?
[11:19:40] <keirlav87> raj: I have a complete app - havn't even begun to turn it into a spa yet though
[11:19:42] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/rrMvs/
[11:19:43] <hlve> baaaaaaaam
[11:19:57] <raj> keirlav87, why at the end did you decide this?
[11:20:49] <TelFiRE> I just put the jQuery hashchange plugin on my site and I've verified that it is being loaded, yet jQuery(window).hashchange(function(){ throws an unexpected identifier syntax error
[11:21:18] <keirlav87> raj: honestly, just to learn the intricacies of developing in this way - being a sheep and following the trend, but i think it diversifies my skillset somewhat
[11:21:40] <Darkstar1> keirlav87: at the bottom of the page. you'll have to excuse me I just got an intro to Javascipt today :/
[11:22:24] <keirlav87> you need a conditional in your click event then - something like
[11:23:50] <keirlav87> if( scrollpos >= $(window).height() ) {  $('.scroll_arrow_top').animate({scrollTop: 0 }); };
[11:23:58] <zfly9> Hey guys I have three images that I want to show at random (but only one) when the page loads, any plugins that do this? http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-shuffle-plugin/ this works but it shows all items
[11:24:22] <elrafael> evening everybody
[11:24:53] <bawigga> I want to run a method as soon as a global variable is set, is that something I can accomplish with deferred objects or promises?
[11:25:15] <elrafael> i have a question, about my plugin. I'm developing a new Jquery plugin. so far, so good. this plugin will write some HTML content
[11:25:53] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: did that conditional make sense to you?
[11:25:53] <elrafael> and I wish to use twitter bootstrap library, specially the modal section, just to show a message to the user
[11:26:10] <keirlav87> Darkstar1: probably won't work straight off the bat like that but that's the gist
[11:26:14] <elrafael> how can I insert the js and css from twitter bootstrap in my plugin?
[11:26:45] <Darkstar1> keirlav87: yeah..
[11:27:24] <elrafael> http://d.pr/n/ZmtM this is my plugin (source code)
[11:27:25] <hlve> keirlav87: wouldn't this work just fine? http://jsfiddle.net/rrMvs/
[11:27:57] <keirlav87> h1ve: yeah just working in the logic to go back to the top if we're at the bottom of the document
[11:28:05] <hlve> ah
[11:28:23] <nfreader> I'm trying to feed the current page URL into a google translate link and then window.location to that page. Not sure what I'm doing wrong though: https://gist.github.com/b6c74775e6ac5151a765
[11:29:01] <keirlav87> h1ve: using your example, i think this will work - http://jsfiddle.net/rrMvs/2/
[11:31:47] <hlve> keirlav87: so close.
[11:32:00] <hlve> if you click it 2 times without scrolling, it just scrolls back up
[11:32:01] <hlve> lol
[11:33:44] <raj> keirlav87, I lost internet again, sorry
[11:33:55] <raj> I saw you say: 14:21 < keirlav87> raj: honestly, just to learn the intricacies  of developing in this way - being a sheep and  following the trend, but i think it  diversifies my skillset somewhat
[11:34:02] <raj> then i asked 14:22 < raj> keirlav87, so you just have a toy app you're playing  with?
[11:34:05] <raj> 14:22 < raj> or an actual project?
[11:35:42] <keirlav87> raj: no the app is production, i work as an inhouse developer, but clientside mvc something that i've only recently stumbled on and i find it interesting
[11:37:06] <raj> keirlav87, so interesting that you'll convert your existing app into spa?
[11:37:12] <raj> I'm nervous about this undertaking
[11:37:19] <raj> I'm not sure how practical it is, tbh
[11:37:20] <Darkstar1> hlve: keirlav87 Thanks for your help
[11:37:26] <keirlav87> yw
[11:40:18] <keirlav87> the structure of my app wasn't a million miles away from the design of an spa anyway, I have a REST-ish api built on Slim at the back which serves json to ajax requests made by jquery at the front - my html / js is already completely seperated from any server side logic
[11:41:14] <keirlav87> i'd say its more service orientated architecture than MVC but i like the seperation i get from it
[11:42:28] <keirlav87> backbone is a good to play with because its more a library than a framework, you can drop it in and use whatever you like, whereas a more strict framework would demand a full rewrite most likely
[11:43:10] <raj> interesting
[11:43:39] <zfly9> anyone available to help? my question is above
[11:44:01] <raj> keirlav87, I feel I fall into that category as well though
[11:44:14] <raj> lots through ajax/json
[11:44:36] <raj> but obviously the html pages are still served through the backend framework as well though
[11:46:28] <CWSpear> zfly9, just have them all on the page but hidden, and give them a common class, then just use: $('.common-class').eq(parseInt(Math.random() * 3)).show();
[11:46:54] <fission6> whats your go to module pattern?
[11:46:55] <bot-t> (12 hours 2 mins ago) <gnarf> tell fission6 sorry I missed you the other day - if there's something in particular you want my advice on feel free to type it all out and ping me, I'll read it :)
[11:47:06] <CWSpear> parseInt(Math.random() * 3) returns a random number, either 0, 1 or 2
[11:47:07] <fasfakir> hi
[11:47:15] <CWSpear> and you're just showing the one with that index
[11:48:34] <fasfakir> hi, i seeking help for .load() function usage.
[11:49:15] <fission6> fasfakir: whats your question
[11:49:21] <fasfakir> charset
[11:49:23] <CWSpear> fasfakir: http://api.jquery.com/load/ usage is on jQuery.com
[11:49:32] <keirlav87> i actually made my documents as plain html, not rendering templates
[11:49:56] <fasfakir> my script is going windows-1254 and jquery load giving same errors
[11:50:03] <fasfakir> broken characters, any.
[11:50:10] <jacobroufa_> hey room
[11:50:37] <fasfakir> sorry.
[11:51:41] <jacobroufa_> so ive got a tablesorter inside of a ui tab that wont load... ive got debug set on my tablesorter but its not even being called, from what i can tell... http://e-rockford.com/reportcard/
[11:52:10] <CWSpear> fasfakir, you might have to set the headers (via your server's response) to match what's on the page.
[11:52:28] <fasfakir> thanks CWSpear
[11:52:50] <jacobroufa_> are tabs known for breaking other things being run on their content?
[11:53:17] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: not really - is the content there when the page starts up?
[11:53:22] <raj> keirlav87, have you found any good article comparing angular and backbone?
[11:53:39] <nobitanobi_> I have an input which has an ID and is inside a DIV. How can I hide that div? (access the parent of that input)?
[11:53:55] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: where is the init for tablesorter?
[11:53:57] <gnarf> file/line?
[11:54:05] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: the tabs are loaded via ajax
[11:54:24] <jacobroufa_> ./scripts/reportcard.js:53
[11:54:35] <gnarf> hrm
[11:54:40] <gnarf> i don't show that file in chrome
[11:55:10] <jacobroufa_> lol look closer
[11:55:21] <jacobroufa_> or else the other jquery ui stuff wouldnt be there
[11:55:35] <jacobroufa_> its all in the same file
[11:55:53] <gnarf> like - i hit CMD+O to goto file in the debugger, and there isn't a reportcard.js
[11:55:58] <keirlav87> i'd recommend this as some good reading initially - http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/
[11:56:13] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: $('#thing').closest('div');
[11:56:23] <jacobroufa_> hrm.
[11:56:42] <fission6> gnarf: hey there got your auto reply
[11:56:43] <jacobroufa_> its showing up fine for me... the file that is.
[11:56:45] <gnarf> found it in scripts
[11:56:46] <gnarf> crazy
[11:56:49] <gnarf> chrome bug?
[11:56:53] <jacobroufa_> possibly
[11:57:00] <nobitanobi_> NoiseEee: would that be better than .parent('div');
[11:57:03] <nobitanobi_> ?
[11:57:08] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: i found it with ctrl+o and in resources
[11:57:21] <gnarf> so
[11:57:28] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: yes
[11:57:41] <nobitanobi_> NoiseEee: why?
[11:57:51] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: found it after a reload
[11:58:24] <jacobroufa_> ah. i apologize in advance for all the other shit on that page... requirements of loading in wrapper elements from parent website. :/
[11:58:30] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: parent() only goes up
[11:58:37] <gnarf> so jacobroufa_ - when you run jl('#mainElem, #mainHigh, #district-table') in that document ready
[11:58:41] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: ... one level
[11:58:41] <gnarf> those elements don't exist
[11:58:46] <gnarf> thats why it isn't loading :)
[11:58:47] <nobitanobi_> I know it's up, is the parent
[11:59:08] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load
[11:59:20] <gnarf> you could defer your tablesorter initialization to the load event on tabs
[12:00:00] <nobitanobi_> If the input is inside a div, the parent is going to be the div
[12:01:13] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: i tried to attach a load function to the .tabs() call, but that didnt seem to work either
[12:01:52] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: where is the tabs init?
[12:02:14] <gnarf> line 60?
[12:02:44] <jacobroufa_> yeah
[12:02:59] <nobitanobi_> Is it necessary to check if an element exists before trying to access its value?
[12:04:03] <danheberden> nobitanobi_: depends on what you're doing. If you did var elem = document.getElementById('#nothere'); elem.whatever; you'd get an error trying to access whatever of undefined
[12:04:22] <danheberden> but if you're just doing, like $('#whatever').val(); or something
[12:04:23] <danheberden> you're cool
[12:04:36] <nobitanobi_> I am trying to see if an input is checked or not, but sometimes that input won't be there
[12:05:06] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: jquery will let you be sloppy and just let you inquire about the .prop() regardless
[12:05:20] <nobitanobi_> NoiseEee:
[12:05:21] <nobitanobi_> ok
[12:05:22] <nobitanobi_> thanks
[12:05:47] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: https://gist.github.com/557a00c66b44bc25d9f1 (excuse bad tabs)
[12:06:09] <gnarf> fission6: yeah, i saw a bunch of your messages late night but you were already gone :)
[12:06:30] <fission6> oh word no worries
[12:06:39] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: hrm. i had already tried building a function like that in my tabs call
[12:06:45] <jacobroufa_> ill test it out again but last time it didnt work
[12:06:56] <fission6> i posted some code i was curious to have you look at, now i've seem to have lost the fiddle
[12:07:00] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: i just put that code in at runtime with a breakpoint and the debugger and it seemed to work
[12:08:04] <gnarf> fission6: no prob, remake it? :)
[12:08:11] <fission6> gnarf: essentially i was tryin got come up with some code to take lets say 10 ajax requests, and execute in groups of 2, when the two are done do the next two, until the queue of ten is done
[12:08:15] <gnarf> fission6: or search for youself on irc.jquery.com in the logs
[12:08:21] <fission6> ok ill search logs
[12:08:31] <fission6> caus ei had decent example code that worked but wanted  areview
[12:10:22] <fission6> gnarf: got it http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/1/ <- i am breaking up requests in groups of two, my solution involved a "Recursvie" type callback of sorts
[12:10:27] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: also, what version are you in?
[12:10:30] <fission6> curious if this is legit or could be simplfieid
[12:10:32] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: UI wise
[12:10:42] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: interesting. works now.
[12:10:51] <jacobroufa_> OHH ya know what i didnt do?
[12:11:03] <jacobroufa_> i didnt call jl(ui.panel).find()
[12:11:12] <jacobroufa_> i just called the selector.tablesorter
[12:11:27] <jacobroufa_> inside of that load function
[12:11:41] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: latest
[12:11:41] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: well that probably would have worked, but could of ended up double initalizing
[12:11:57] <gnarf> fission6: i think you need a .length on your array check
[12:12:08] <gnarf> ?js if ([]) console.log ("empty array is still truthy");
[12:12:09] <fission6> gnarf: yep
[12:12:13] <bot-t> gnarf: "empty array is still truthy"
[12:12:16] <fission6> i've since added that
[12:12:28] <gnarf> fission6: also - i'd make "start" return der.promise()
[12:13:00] <gnarf> and perhaps resolve it with something useful
[12:13:17] <fission6> ah this is i think more of the final code http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/6/
[12:13:37] <fission6> is th econcept of the recursive callback to breakUp ok
[12:13:40] <gnarf> fission6: so, what are you doing with the data?
[12:13:54] <gnarf> fission6: makes sense, and is quite elegant imo
[12:14:12] <gnarf> actually
[12:14:13] <fission6> ok nice
[12:14:16] <gnarf> after you moved to /6/
[12:14:19] <gnarf> you lost something here
[12:14:27] <gnarf> that outer closure was useful
[12:14:39] <fission6> yes you are right
[12:14:45] <fission6> crap i dont hink i have the working final one
[12:14:48] <fission6> let me review
[12:15:15] <fission6> yea i never fiddled the final working one
[12:15:18] <gnarf> like - how are you getting the data out of these?
[12:15:30] <fission6> let me post the actual code now that you see what i am doing
[12:15:36] <fission6> on a smaller level
[12:17:56] <fission6> gnarf: here is some final code i have which seems to work well - i do have more code clean up to do, and to do some refactoring on the progress bar / notificatoin logic https://gist.github.com/3989208
[12:18:36] <fission6> i also think i have some pipe()s where they could just be dones()
[12:20:40] <gnarf> fission6: so the work is being done in process, no need to actually return the results at the end?
[12:21:26] <fission6> gnarf: well i am cheaply just modified a global var vs returning
[12:21:33] <fission6> that too could likely be looked at
[12:21:45] <gnarf> make it a local var, then resolve with it
[12:21:48] <gnarf> after you're done
[12:21:54] <fission6> combine the results
[12:22:09] <fission6> from the two jobs in the bottom when?
[12:23:03] <fission6> gnarf: updated https://gist.github.com/3989208
[12:23:07] <fission6> with processSite
[12:24:27] <gnarf> fission6: one sec, playing with an idea here
[12:25:08] <fission6> please do, conceptually it all works, i want to refine the code a bit if the pattern in general makes sense
[12:25:38] <awc737> how can I assign a variable to the element which is being appended after?
[12:25:39] <awc737> jQuery(elements[i]).after('<p class="form-error" style="width: ' + jQuery(elements[i]).width() + 'px";>This field is required</p>');
[12:26:01] <awc737> when I do var something = all that, something is = to the elements[i] , not the <p> after it
[12:26:10] <gnarf> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/10/
[12:26:35] <gnarf> awc737: correct
[12:26:40] <gnarf> awc737: if you want the p
[12:27:00] <gnarf> you should $('<p>...</p>').insertAfter( elements[i] )
[12:27:15] <gnarf> both after and insertAfter return the left side
[12:27:59] <awc737> hmm
[12:28:06] <fission6> gnarf: will review
[12:28:09] <awc737> the only difference between after and insertAfter is they switch the left side?
[12:28:13] <fission6> it looks like overall the approach is decent though?
[12:28:43] <awc737> what about jQuery(something).next('.form-error').width('900')
[12:28:45] <gnarf> fission6: yeah, it makes sense
[12:28:49] <awc737> or .next(p)
[12:28:51] <fission6> whats this doing setTimeout(complete, 0);
[12:28:59] <gnarf> awc737: .next() is a traverser
[12:29:05] <gnarf> so it changes to the next element
[12:29:52] <awc737> right, the next(p) would be the element i'm after
[12:29:55] <awc737> would that take longer?
[12:29:58] <gnarf> awc737: after/insertAfter are the same operation, a.after(b) === a and b.insertAfter(a) === b - both do the same thing tho
[12:30:16] <gnarf> awc737: just use insertAfter, better than using the extra traversing step
[12:30:24] <awc737> k good point, thanks'
[12:30:38] <fission6> gnarf: $.when.apply(null, chunkedRequests).done(setTimeout(breakUp,2)); <- would put two second delays before each request right? i need this for api throttling
[12:30:47] <gnarf> fission6: not really
[12:31:09] <gnarf> fission6: if you put the setTimeout part INSIDE a function, yes :)
[12:31:29] <gnarf> also, 2000 not 2
[12:31:30] <raj> keirlav87, this is great!
[12:31:32] <raj> i wish it was longer
[12:33:24] <gnarf> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/11/
[12:37:11] <fission6> gnarf: sexy thanks
[12:37:57] <gnarf> fission6: trying to think about how I'd approach it
[12:38:02] <gnarf> without having seen this
[12:38:24] <gnarf> but it probably ends up very similar to this
[12:38:42] <fission6> yea
[12:38:48] <fission6> i mean as long as its reasonable
[12:39:00] <fission6> its just for an internal tool to aggreate a bunch of api calls
[12:39:10] <fission6> ideally id do most of it all on the server side on python
[12:39:25] <gnarf> why 2 at a time?
[12:39:31] <fission6> but its for a client and not worrying about dpeloying something server side is a ncie way to offer the solution
[12:39:48] <fission6> gnarf: i need to make potentially a 100 or so calls
[12:39:53] <fission6> API has 100 calls a min
[12:40:11] <fission6> so i want to do them in bursts of 20 and pause for 3 seconds in between
[12:40:15] <fission6> or somethign to that affect
[12:40:19] <fission6> need to work this out
[12:40:19] <gnarf> so this is more about rate limiting?
[12:40:22] <fission6> oh yea
[12:40:38] <gnarf> i have a thought then
[12:40:51] <gnarf> are there other api calls you want to have higher priority?
[12:40:57] <gnarf> or things like that?
[12:41:00] <fission6> nope
[12:41:03] <gnarf> or is this the only work you need to be concerned about
[12:41:04] <gnarf> cool
[12:41:21] <fission6> just need to do a bunch of calls paginatinate and aggregate some findinds
[12:41:24] <fission6> present to user
[12:41:34] <fission6> and let them select a few things and update with some form info
[12:41:52] <fission6> its turning out ot be a nice solution
[12:42:09] <fission6> wish i could get rid of the chrome extension its all wraped in but need to do cross domain requests
[12:45:43] <gnarf> fission6: yeah, i mean, if this works, it works :)
[12:46:01] <gnarf> fission6: i'm not really sure how i'd approach it not having seen this approach
[12:46:01] <fission6> true
[12:46:29] <fission6> don't think to hard cause i want to just continue with my solution as being appropriate
[12:46:30] <ravenz> actually I would call complete() when I got no data back
[12:46:57] <fission6> ravenz: yea good safty check
[12:47:46] <fission6> gnarf: ravenz what module pattern would you use for something like this https://gist.github.com/3989208
[12:47:53] <ravenz> and maybe you could move the done() inside the getPagination() function
[12:48:02] <fission6> was going to wrap it up as described here http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript
[12:49:08] <ravenz> breakUp could be an IIFE
[12:49:31] <fission6> iife?
[12:49:48] <gnarf> ravenz: its a net loss of one byte after minification to use named funcitons
[12:49:59] <gnarf> function a(){}a();
[12:50:00] <gnarf> vs
[12:50:08] <fission6> gnarf: is this ok pattern for module http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript
[12:50:10] <gnarf> (function(){})();
[12:50:29] <fission6> can you fork https://gist.github.com/3989208 and show me how you'd expose it
[12:50:48] <gnarf> fission6: addy knows what he's talking about :)
[12:51:24] <gnarf> fission6: jQuery approaches it by dropping everything inside a giant closure, and then modifying window.jQuery = {}
[12:51:35] <gnarf> well actually, window.jQuery = function()
[12:51:36] <gnarf> but yeah
[12:52:11] <gnarf> fission6: tbh - I would just abstract it into something like var myAPI.get_____().done()
[12:52:22] <gnarf> but
[12:52:54] <ravenz> I like the Crockford's power constructor pattern
[12:54:01] <fission6> gnarf: can you show me by wrapping the code here https://gist.github.com/3989208
[12:54:03] <fission6> for an example
[12:54:31] <VooDooNOFX_> How can I target an input which has the new html5 "required" attribute?
[12:55:09] <fission6> VooDooNOFX_: attr()
[12:55:40] <fission6> i mean attribute selector
[12:56:13] <ravenz> ?selectors @ VooDooNOFX_
[12:56:14] <bot-t> VooDooNOFX_, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[12:56:21] <fission6> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[12:56:37] <gnarf> fission6: https://gist.github.com/3989405
[12:57:11] <fission6> gnarf: this is great ive learned much from you the last few days
[12:57:14] <fission6> thanks
[12:57:27] <fission6> what does IIFE  mean
[12:57:45] <gnarf> ?iife
[12:57:45] <bot-t> Immediately Invoked Function Expression: http://bit.ly/js-iife
[12:57:49] <fission6> ok
[12:58:12] <gnarf> some would try to call it a self-executing anonymous, but as ben points out in that article
[12:58:14] <gnarf> its an IIFE
[12:58:21] <gnarf> also, "iffy" is just fun to say
[12:58:24] <fission6> finally js is starting to make sense
[12:58:31] <fission6> thanks gnarf and company
[12:58:52] <gnarf> fission6: the factoid name sounds lame, but see ?101
[12:58:52] <bot-t> fission6, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[12:58:57] <gnarf> eloquent is a great book
[12:59:28] <gnarf> feels more like 101-299 :)
[12:59:37] <fission6> i shall reciew
[13:00:05] <fission6> i have one book on js i bought to try and help me learn, it made a few things clear but was hard to get into from end to end
[13:01:26] <gnarf> eloquent is dense, but good
[13:01:37] <gnarf> i read it 4 or 5 times before I really picked everything out of it
[13:02:02] <fission6> gnarf: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
[13:02:04] <fission6> got that
[13:02:54] <gnarf> I would also suggest resig's bookhttp://jspro.org/
[13:02:58] <gnarf> http://jspro.org/
[13:03:20] <ravenz> it looks biiig
[13:03:21] <ravenz> :d
[13:03:38] <gnarf> 350 pages
[13:03:51] <fission6> interesting
[13:03:56] <gnarf> secrets of the ninja might be out some year soon too
[13:04:11] <gnarf> http://www.manning.com/resig/
[13:04:15] <fission6> i finally feel i have a good grip on python so i guess getting a strong grip on js would be good
[13:04:23] <gnarf> http://jsninja.com/
[13:04:41] <fission6> its just hard staying uo to date with everything on more than 1 technology
[13:04:45] <fission6> like bleeding edge up to date
[13:04:54] <ravenz> I am not good enough to read ninja level things
[13:04:55] <DeathByDoubleDip> heh, just got back from the library just now; went to pickup Crockford's "javascript: the good parts"
[13:04:58] <ravenz> yet
[13:05:08] <gnarf> fission6: the nice thing about javascript is that we are working on 10 year old browsers still
[13:05:11] <gnarf> fission6: :)
[13:05:28] <fission6> true
[13:05:29] <gnarf> i'm not a fan of good parts
[13:05:32] <gnarf> i've read it a few times
[13:05:34] <gnarf> but not a fan
[13:05:40] <fission6> so you like the bad partys?
[13:05:47] <fission6> parts
[13:06:10] <gnarf> i think its just the writing style, and some of the good parts aren't really that good
[13:06:11] <gnarf> :)
[13:06:15] <fission6> ha
[13:06:31] <ravenzz> sometimes are just obvious
[13:06:41] <gnarf> honestly, I think that functional programming aspects of JS are really where you should research
[13:06:46] <DeathByDoubleDip> should be quick to blitz through then
[13:06:48] <gnarf> libs like underscore provide so much utility
[13:07:07] <gnarf> lets you write really tiny reusable stuff
[13:07:12] <gnarf> composable even
[13:07:19] <fission6> underscore is why i got more into js
[13:07:26] <fission6> because its what sucked me into python
[13:07:28] <gnarf> fission6: lo-dash ? :)
[13:07:53] <fission6> having strong internal objects that are easy to work with
[13:08:05] <fission6> standard objects, etc.
[13:08:48] <acidjazz> i have a trigger and a setInterval calling a function, how can i detect inside the function which triggered it?
[13:08:59] <fission6> this?
[13:09:40] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: lodash ftw!
[13:09:45] <fission6> gnarf: do you think underscore would ever be merged into js core?
[13:09:59] <NoiseEee> acidjazz: put the word "debugger;"
[13:10:12] <NoiseEee> acidjazz: when your debugger opens and the script is paused, investimigate
[13:10:40] <acidjazz> yea i know how to do that NoiseEee
[13:10:55] <acidjazz> and i figured a couple diff ways this could work.. im more asking for what would be proper
[13:11:30] <gnarf> fission6: like, you mean part of the ECMA standard?
[13:11:32] <gnarf> probably not
[13:11:36] <gnarf> it works well as a library
[13:11:48] <gnarf> fission6: https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash
[13:11:55] <gnarf> fission6: i don't actually use underscore
[13:11:59] <gnarf> I use lo-dash
[13:12:01] <fission6> why
[13:12:05] <fission6> lo-dash
[13:12:11] <fission6> just cause its 'faster'
[13:12:42] <gnarf> because its maintained by jdalton - and jdalton writes good stuff, see http://jsperf.com/
[13:12:52] <gnarf> also
[13:12:59] <gnarf> I can understand his test suite
[13:13:04] <gnarf> :)
[13:13:39] <fission6> nice
[13:13:58] <gnarf> its 100% underscore compatible
[13:14:04] <gnarf> and adds some things of its own
[13:14:11] <acidjazz> i have a trigger and a setInterval calling a function, whats the proper way to detect which called it?
[13:14:20] <gnarf> http://lodash.com/docs
[13:14:38] <fission6> gnarf: why wont they ever merge this into the ECMA standard so js supports this out of the box
[13:14:40] <gnarf> acidjazz: first of all, setInterval is a bad-practice :)
[13:14:42] <gnarf> ?setInterval
[13:14:43] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[13:15:11] <acidjazz> and second of all?
[13:15:26] <gnarf> acidjazz: secondly, an event bound by jQuery will always be called with its first argument instanceof jQuery.Event
[13:16:45] <fission6> is there a proposal anywhere to do this?
[13:17:03] <gnarf> fission6: do what?
[13:17:04] <acidjazz> so how would i check that inside my function.. this instanceof jQuery.Event?
[13:17:21] <gnarf> fission6: there really isn't a need for the JS interpreter to know about a lib like lo-dash/underscore
[13:17:31] <gnarf> fission6: because it can be added pretty trivially
[13:17:39] <fission6> i don tknow, would be nice to see more sophistated standard object types
[13:17:57] <gnarf> fission6: things that go into the language are like, syntax and Date objects
[13:18:01] <acidjazz> gnarf: console.log(this instanceof jQuery.Event) is false for .click trigger as well as being called by itself or by setInterval
[13:18:14] <gnarf> acidjazz: "this" is not the first argument dude
[13:18:32] <acidjazz> oh u want e
[13:18:33] <fission6> gnarf: i guess but given how useful the library is you'd think there would be a strong argument to have it formally backed in to js objects
[13:18:35] <acidjazz> kk
[13:18:35] <acidjazz> tnx
[13:18:56] <gnarf> fission6: eh - lots of the array comprehension stuff is in ES5 already
[13:19:15] <fission6> ok
[13:19:27] <fission6> anywho gonna do some more dev work, catch y'all later
[13:19:29] <gnarf> all the funcitonal/composable stuff is amazingly fast in modern interpreters anyway.
[13:20:39] <jacobroufa_> fission6: gnarf: http://perfectionkills.com/category/es5/
[13:22:10] <fission6> jacobroufa_: interesting, will review
[13:22:35] <jacobroufa_> fission6: not really *exactly* what you were asking, but pertinent to the discussion i thought.
[13:22:39] <gnarf> one other random tip fission6 - at some point I started to see the scope itself as an object in JS - it helped a lot
[13:23:04] <fission6> i think i know what you mean by that, will keep it in mind
[13:23:05] <jacobroufa_> and yeah, certainly interesting. i like that some of the utility of libs like underscore has been added in es5
[13:23:35] <jacobroufa_> gnarf: you mean this?
[13:23:53] <gnarf> jacobroufa_: i mean the whole scope, like the closure itself is an object
[13:23:57] <gnarf> not literally
[13:24:03] <gnarf> but like thats how memory management works
[13:24:15] <jacobroufa_> hrm
[13:24:24] <gnarf> you "hold things" in "scopes"
[13:24:38] <jacobroufa_> well isnt that programming in a nutshell?
[13:24:44] <jacobroufa_> too meta for me
[13:24:44] <jacobroufa_> lol
[13:24:49] <gnarf> it is pretty meta
[13:24:56] <context> haha
[13:24:58] <gnarf> but its helps organize things
[13:25:07] <gnarf> stuff like "module pattern"
[13:25:19] <gnarf> are second nature
[13:25:40] <gnarf> prototype is also kinda hard to understand, but it rocks
[13:25:47] <jacobroufa_> i think i get what youre saying, to a degree. not nearly the js ninja you are though haha
[13:26:10] <context> yo dawg. heard you like meta. so we put your meta in some meta so your meta can meta its meta while you meta
[13:26:47] <tw2113> what's your context for this context ?
[13:27:02] <Vendethiel> hello - any tips on how I can download all the themes for jQ UI 1.9.1 at once ?
[13:27:05] <jacobroufa_> LOL context. must be a bot with a name like that making such whack comments
[13:27:24] <context> tw2113: the context is too meta for you
[13:27:25] <context> :p
[13:27:43] * jacobroufa_ facepalms
[13:27:44] <context> jacobroufa_: ouch :(
[13:28:35] <jacobroufa_> context: aw dont be like that. i was just looking for context and kidding while i kid with context. :p
[13:28:47] <context> hahaha
[13:30:04] <jacobroufa_> damn nick length limits
[13:30:48] <gnarf> Vendethiel: um... - hack a little jquery together on the download page to change the select and click the button for each theme?
[13:31:34] <Vendethiel> eh.
[13:32:16] <gnarf> Vendethiel: I mean, you could just look at https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/ and see if you can figure out how to make it build the themes for you too
[13:32:42] <gnarf> Vendethiel: like if you clone that project and write your own node.js frontend, you could prolly call builder for each theme
[13:32:47] <gnarf> and just write the output somewhere
[13:32:59] <Vendethiel> that's far too complicated.
[13:33:19] <gnarf> Vendethiel: also, you could post an issue on the download.jqueryui.com and ask if someone would create a way to download all the themes
[13:33:38] <Danwe_WMDE> how can it be that $.when( allJobs ).state() returns 'resolved' but allJobs[0].state() returns 'pending' ?? allJobs is an array of $.Deferred, none of them is resolved.
[13:33:39] <Vendethiel> I'll probably do that, but in the meantime
[13:33:51] <gnarf> it seems like a valid option if you wanted to offer theme selection to your end user
[13:34:09] <gnarf> i wonder if its on our cdn
[13:34:11] <gnarf> lemme check
[13:34:11] <danheberden> Danwe_WMDE: an array of deferreds is just an array
[13:34:20] <danheberden> which will resolve immediately
[13:34:28] <Danwe_WMDE> danheberden: thanks
[13:34:30] <danheberden> $.when.apply( $, allJobs )
[13:34:35] <danheberden> if you want to do it that way
[13:34:49] <c0pp3rnick> how can I replace .live() with .on()
[13:35:14] <c0pp3rnick> I lost my initial functionality as methods aren't fired up after the change O_o

[13:35:33] <gnarf> Vendethiel: you could just scrape it off the CDN
[13:35:53] <gnarf> Vendethiel: this tells me that our release process already does this
[13:35:59] <gnarf> Vendethiel: also
[13:36:06] <gnarf> Vendethiel: I could just build a tar gzip for you
[13:36:08] <gnarf> if you'd like
[13:36:14] <Vendethiel> I'd like that much, yeah
[13:37:29] <gnarf> Vendethiel: just waiting for dropbox to upload it
[13:37:34] <Vendethiel> thanks :)
[13:37:35] <gnarf> while i do that
[13:37:40] <gnarf> would you post the issue please?
[13:37:46] <Vendethiel> I am

[13:47:20] <NoiseEee> dblosevn: no
[13:47:23] <motaka2> dblosevn: Is it working in your browser?
[13:47:24] <NoiseEee> delegate is deprecated
[13:47:33] <NoiseEee> motaka2: seriously, why are you still here asking this.
[13:47:48] <NoiseEee> motaka2: you are dealing with A BUG IN IE
[13:47:54] <dblosevn> thought i just read not to use live use on then on referred me to delagate
[13:48:33] <motaka2> NoiseEee: Beacause I am a funny guy and I want make others laugh. Why do u really think I am asking ? my problem is not solved and I wait for new people to help me
[13:49:23] <NoiseEee> motaka2: there was a Stack Overflow suggesting how to solve it.  Understand that if your solution requires listening to a click event on an <option>, it will fail.  There is *no way around that*
[13:49:31] <NoiseEee> motaka2: use the change event.  done.

[13:49:42] <m41is> hi, can anyone help me? i want that the box grow bigger but the position absolute from the middle of the box? http://jsfiddle.net/xepyE/2/
[13:49:53] <dblosevn> oh i didnt read far enough down
[13:49:55] <TelFiRE> I don't suppose there's a sendEverythingBackWhereItWasWhenThePageLoaded() function eh
[13:49:59] <dblosevn> :-(
[13:50:19] <TelFiRE> just have to set vars and animate it back by hand?
[13:50:20] <motaka2> NoiseEee: change is not what I want and I have already explained why. please sont interfere in other people answers
[13:51:35] <motaka2> dblosevn: deligate also doesnt work in IE
[13:51:37] <NoiseEee> motaka2: if you want it to work in IE, you simply cannot use "click" on an option.  You're driving into a brick wall repeatedly and asking why.  good luck.
[13:52:02] <NoiseEee> motaka2: *nothing* will work if you're askign about the click event on an <option> in IE.  NOTHING.
[13:52:04] <NoiseEee> good luck
[13:52:17] <dblosevn> if option doesnt support the click event in ie then it doesnt support the click event
[13:52:38] <dblosevn> the way you bind simply doesnt matter
[13:53:20] <motaka2> NoiseEee: I will use change or any other event if it first open the menu and wait for another click for the next option. your problem is you dont understand the difference between click and cchange, at least make yourself a test case nad then judge
[13:54:13] <NoiseEee> motaka2: damn you nailed my problem
[13:54:47] <motaka2> NoiseEee: What do you mean ?
[13:55:54] <motaka2> NoiseEee: I dont want the name "click" I want a behaviour like click
[13:56:15] <m41is> hi, pls help me. i want to grow the box bigger but the element should hold the position on the middle. http://jsfiddle.net/xepyE/2/
[13:56:16] <dblosevn> I think i have ran into this in the past
[13:56:29] <dblosevn> pretty sure i bound a click event to the select instead of the option
[13:57:44] <dblosevn> because change inst fired until blur
[13:57:57] <dblosevn> *isnt
[13:59:49] <motaka2> dblosevn: thats a good choice - but my remote users should learn that they press the left mous button then drag to the option and then release it - I dont know how to solve this - here is a code that some one said it solved it's problem - http://pastebin.com/r91Qtw47  but I dont know how to apply it  to my case
[14:03:37] <motaka2> NoiseEee: do u know what that code is suggesting me?
[14:09:09] <gnarf> dblosevn: motaka2: I'm pretty sure change event fires on change for a select, not blur
[14:09:16] <gnarf> but it might not for keyboard nav
[14:09:53] <gnarf> change event is the solution - either way
[14:09:59] <gnarf> click on option doesn't work
[14:11:47] <cordoval> when on doing some js with overlays and displaying say a form who has a hight of 700 when submitting i get the new overlay loaded up off the visible current side I am in at the bottom of the page
[14:12:01] <cordoval> is there a jquery thing to scroll up automatically?
[14:13:17] <Aug|FU_thatsWHY> would i be able to make the popup a div in with blockui?

[14:16:00] <goddard> is there any way to speed up the ajax loading time?
[14:17:47] <systemfault> Buy better servers.... optimize your code on the server..
[14:18:09] <TelFiRE> I have something set up that when you hover over it, it calls a function that checks if it has the class "active". When you click it, it gives it the class active and does some animation. I'm having a problem though, when you hover over it, click it, then move quickly down to the now-active one. It still thinks you never "un-hovered" so it doesn't do the new (and different) rollover animation that is only for the active one. Does this make sense and does an
[14:18:10] <TelFiRE> have a solution?
[14:18:16] <motaka2> My problem is not yet solved
[14:21:22] <gnarf> motaka2: use the change event - and / or - see ?demo
[14:21:23] <bot-t> motaka2, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:22:54] <motaka2> gnarf: I cant use change event, I know change is working but wheb the use clicks an option for reselcting it he has to chenge the option and then go back to the previou option thats why I need some like the behave of click in ff for select option
[14:23:44] <gnarf> motaka2: that doesn't make sense to me - see ?demo
[14:23:44] <bot-t> motaka2, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:24:07] <gnarf> I need to see what you're doing, and why change wouldn't work - you can't bind to click on options reliably, nor should you try
[14:30:19] <KWhat_Work> Should it be possible to call a widget on a collection of elements?
[14:32:56] <Hapzz> $("/html/body/div[5]/div/table[3]/tbody/tr/td[5]").hide();
[14:32:59] <Hapzz> why wouldn't that work
[14:33:09] <Hapzz> according to the docs, jquery supports xpath
[14:33:29] <Hapzz> "One of the selector languages that jQuery supports, as a part of its expression language is XPath."
[14:35:58] <Kiai> Does jquery have a function similar to php explode?
[14:36:23] <KWhat_Work> Kiai: .split
[14:36:41] <grafi> not jquery though ^^
[14:36:42] <KWhat_Work> i believe it is standard javascript
[14:36:52] <Kiai> KWhat_Work: I tried this in query and it seems to be standard js
[14:36:55] <Hapzz> anyone?
[14:37:36] <Kiai> yes, thank you very much!
[14:37:52] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: I dont think anyone knows. Heck i didnt even know it supported xpath
[14:38:07] <grafi> are you sure that is still valid in the current version of jquery Hapzz?
[14:38:41] <Auger> i'm a newbie can someone help me understand something
[14:39:06] <grafi> that depends entirely on you doesnt it? :P
[14:39:09] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: "XPath selectors are available as a plugin."
[14:40:22] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: no longer supported as part of jquery starting with 1.3
[14:40:31] <KWhat_Work> s/1.3/1.2
[14:40:35] <Hapzz> where do i get that plugin
[14:41:17] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: i hate to respond with let me google that for you but there are several available
[14:41:46] <Auger> i for the life of me can not implement this http://dreamerslab.com/demos/jquery-blockui-alternative-with-jquery-msg-plugin
[14:41:53] <Auger> anyone able to do that easily and explain?
[14:42:13] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: https://github.com/jfirebaugh/jquery-xpath  comes up as #1 ;)
[14:43:20] <Hapzz> is there a way for me to select some element with css, by something like "3rd <tr>"?
[14:43:39] <KWhat_Work> Hapzz: yes
[14:43:59] <Hapzz> how?
[14:44:27] <KWhat_Work> at least i thought there was an :N selector or something like that
[14:45:30] <Hapzz> :nth-child(even)
[14:45:31] <Hapzz> thanks
[14:46:09] <KWhat_Work> ah just found it
[14:46:44] <JavaLover> does anyone get like...
[14:46:51] <JavaLover> regex expressions?
[14:47:24] <grafi> the simple ones ^^
[14:47:55] <JavaLover> '/http:\/\/([a-z0-9_\.\-\+\&\!\#\~\/\,]+)/i'
[14:48:09] <JavaLover> does that make any sense to you grafi?
[14:48:15] <KWhat_Work> yah
[14:48:30] <JavaLover> can you like break it down to me real quick? i'm just confused
[14:48:46] <grafi> looks like an url matcher doesnt it?
[14:48:57] <JavaLover> it is but I don't get the http:\/
[14:49:00] <JavaLover> why the \/?
[14:49:09] <JavaLover> do you have to escape slashes?
[14:49:16] <KWhat_Work> JavaLover: yes
[14:49:28] <KWhat_Work> JavaLover: it matches http:// followed by  one ore more of the char between the []
[14:49:35] <KWhat_Work> and its case insenstive
[14:50:00] <JavaLover> oh so why the ()
[14:50:04] <JavaLover> paranthiticals on it why?
[14:50:09] <KWhat_Work> thats a subset
[14:50:27] <JavaLover> ok and the + after it?
[14:50:29] <JavaLover> is that necessary?
[14:50:39] <KWhat_Work> the + after the ] is needed
[14:50:41] <JavaLover> towards the end...
[14:50:45] <MagmaRules> hi there, anyone knows if there is a way to connect two tab groups in jquery?
[14:50:46] <JavaLover> what's htat do?
[14:50:53] <KWhat_Work> it means that the expression needs to match at least one of the chars between the []
[14:50:54] <JavaLover> i have a chart but i think i get it...that's my last question
[14:51:02] <JavaLover> ohhhhhhhh
[14:51:21] <Auger> gatdamn
[14:51:43] <grafi> Auger where did you get the source? oÃ´
[14:51:55] <grafi> or do you want to implement something like this yourself? :o
[14:52:01] <Auger> i want to implement something like this myself
[14:52:09] <Auger> but i look at the source code
[14:52:21] <Auger> and i don't know where they tie in the scripts and how they call the functions and what not
[14:52:24] <gnarf> anyone else who was interested in motaka2's issue - basically, he had a select he was using to open a window, but if someone closed the window then selected the same option again - no change event.   Solution was to just empty out the select after opening the window so it always fires the change.
[14:54:11] <motaka2> gnarf: Thanks for fallowing my case - It is really nice of you
[14:54:28] <steveoh> how do you find out what datatype a .ajax request used?
[14:54:49] <gnarf> steveoh: the options property of the jqXHR should have it
[14:54:54] <gnarf> "this.options"
[14:55:09] <steveoh> if i console.dir($.ajax(args))
[14:55:14] <steveoh> i don't see a dataType
[14:55:16] <steveoh> property
[14:55:30] <steveoh> i don't set it in the args object gnarf
[14:55:45] <Auger> do i call a function in the onClick  ?
[14:56:25] <steveoh> i only ask since if my url has callback=something the success funciton is not getting invoked
[14:56:30] <gnarf> steveoh: the callback should have "this" as jqXHR
[14:56:44] <gnarf> its in the options
[14:57:09] <steveoh> i don't follow gnarf
[14:57:22] <steveoh> what are ya saying?
[14:58:48] <gnarf> steveoh: when you attach a callback to it via done / fail
[14:59:01] <gnarf> the "this" of the callback should be the ajax settings used
[14:59:07] <steveoh> i'm using success and complete
[14:59:17] <steveoh> and the success is never being invoked
[14:59:35] <steveoh> when i make a jsonp request
[14:59:51] <steveoh> guess i'll make a done callback
[15:00:23] <gnarf> sounds like the jsonp request is not a jsonp response - did you look at it in the network panel?
[15:01:48] <steveoh> gnarf: done never gets called either on jsonp request
[15:02:05] <gnarf> steveoh: yup, its probably erroring
[15:02:18] <steveoh> comes back test({"status":200,"message":null,"responseTime":0})
[15:02:24] <steveoh> its valid
[15:02:25] <gnarf> test ?
[15:02:30] <steveoh> thats my callback name
[15:02:42] <gnarf> jQuery assigns a random callback name
[15:02:43] <steveoh> people choose their callback function name
[15:02:49] <gnarf> for each request
[15:02:52] <steveoh> well not everyone is down witht hat
[15:03:07] <steveoh> not everyone is goign to use this api with jquery
[15:03:24] <steveoh> just wondering why jquery can't handle a custom callback param
[15:03:41] <gnarf> steveoh: because it does &callback=jQuery_1231251236012341236
[15:03:52] <gnarf> and then proxies the response using success/done
[15:04:00] <steveoh> sure, but can't it see that a callback was supplied and proxy to it
[15:04:10] <gnarf> steveoh: think about that for a minute
[15:04:19] <steveoh> yeah
[15:04:23] <gnarf> steveoh: you want jQuery to override the callback name you provided
[15:04:29] <gnarf> what happens if you do two requests in serial
[15:04:37] <steveoh> so i need to instead say callback={} or something in the url
[15:04:37] <gnarf> er parallel
[15:04:49] <steveoh> whats the convention?
[15:04:56] <gnarf> steveoh: callback=? --- or leave it off and ajax adds it automatically
[15:05:08] <steveoh> well its not a cross domain request
[15:05:16] <steveoh> and i don't want to add the force flag
[15:05:41] <gnarf> then make your JSON API only wrap the "P" part when callback is present
[15:05:54] <gnarf> so you can use local ajax sans JSONP and just get a pure JSON response
[15:06:47] <steveoh> jsonp is a way to override the callback function name
[15:06:54] <steveoh> a property on ajax
[15:07:12] <ziz_> Hey guys I have this code http://pastebin.com/DhwvJXcx and it works but it makes each span rotate, and I only want the child span to rotate, is this possible without writing a separate function for each?
[15:07:22] <steveoh> jsonpCallback i mean
[15:07:26] <m41is> hi, how is it possible to customize the scrollbar in fancybox? is there any good tutorial outside?
[15:08:43] <gnarf> steveoh: cool
[15:08:55] <gnarf> steveoh: why not use pure JSON when it's not XDR tho?
[15:09:05] <steveoh> its an api exploring page
[15:09:18] <steveoh> where you can pop all the params in and make a request to the web api
[15:09:18] <darrennnn> if anyone is familiar with jquery and jsfiddle, do you mind checking this? i am trying to teach myself to send an receive data using ajax but i have no idea why i am getting nothing back in the data variable. http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/BSSb6/12/
[15:09:22] <steveoh> and it shows you the response
[15:09:26] <steveoh> interactively
[15:09:31] <steveoh> and callback is one of the settings
[15:09:54] <gnarf> okay
[15:10:11] <steveoh> so if someone wants to see what will return from a jsonp request i want to show the text
[15:11:19] <steveoh> would setting the dataType to html try not to eval the jsonp response text?
[15:11:46] <gnarf> use the jsonpCallback option then
[15:11:56] <gnarf> steveoh: text ?
[15:12:04] <steveoh> the response string
[15:12:07] <steveoh> the jsonp
[15:12:11] <gnarf> steveoh: just do the dataType: "text"
[15:12:22] <gnarf> then you get the response as text every time
[15:12:33] <steveoh> ahh, i read the docs wrong
[15:12:44] <steveoh> i saw default as xml json script or html
[15:12:49] <steveoh> when there are more underneath
[15:12:50] <ziz_> anyone?
[15:25:21] <KWhat_Work> ziz_: im not sure i follow one sec
[15:25:33] <ziz_> KWhat_Work I figured it out
[15:26:10] <KWhat_Work> brb got to go pee on something
[15:27:27] <TelFiRE> pee on bill gates
[15:30:28] <mastermaw> hello all
[15:31:19] <mastermaw> i'm new to jquery, i'm trying to use a variable in a list of options
[15:31:52] <mastermaw> not sure that makes sense, not quite sure of terminology - look at http://pastebin.com/reSdxBzF
[15:32:13] <mastermaw> the images variable is printed as "images" and not the variable contents
[15:32:51] <KWhat_Work> mastermaw: looks fine, although IDK what supersized is
[15:33:10] <mastermaw> it's a jquery image gallery
[15:33:11] <KWhat_Work> convert your tabs to 4 spaces ;)
[15:33:48] <mastermaw> i know, visually not good
[15:34:04] <mastermaw> but as mentioned, the images variable is printed as "images"
[15:34:21] <mastermaw> and not the actual variable contents
[15:34:31] <mastermaw> line 41
[15:35:20] <wunderCatze> hello guys, I am using kinetic.js and I am tring to put an image as background of a rectangle. I tried var bar = new Image();	bar.src = 'bar.png'; but it doesnt work. How to?
[15:36:06] <KWhat_Work> mastermaw: you know about variable scope?
[15:36:29] <KWhat_Work> mastermaw: see line 6
[15:36:35] <KWhat_Work> apply scope
[15:36:47] <danheberden> wunderCatze: does kinetic support that?
[15:36:55] <danheberden> pretty sure you have to make a Kinetic.Image()
[15:37:06] * KWhat_Work assumes that data is actually correct.
[15:38:33] <wunderCatze> well, ofcourse it supports it
[15:38:43] <wunderCatze> it's right here: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-set-fill-with-kineticjs/
[15:39:02] <wunderCatze> it doesnt says anything about kinetic.image though
[15:39:14] <wunderCatze> images are load... javascriptically
[15:39:35] <wunderCatze> but... something is not working in my code
[15:40:41] <wunderCatze> not sure if appending the image to the document or not...
[15:41:51] <wunderCatze> wth? My code is working now, but I dont know why :D
[15:42:02] <danheberden> wunderCatze: probably because it's cached now
[15:42:04] <wunderCatze> I swear I didnt do anything
[15:42:07] <danheberden> you probably aren't waiting for the images to load
[15:42:10] <danheberden> before you are trying to use them
[15:42:13] <wunderCatze> hmm
[15:42:29] <danheberden> hence the load event
[15:42:34] <danheberden> hence the `loadImages` function in that example
[15:42:41] <danheberden> that THEN calls draw()
[15:43:06] <wunderCatze> I didnt used load events
[15:43:17] <wunderCatze> just simple image vars
[15:43:25] <wunderCatze> the image has 300 bytes
[15:43:30] <danheberden> load events are how you do it javascriptically
[15:44:10] <wunderCatze> var bar = new Image();
[15:44:10] <wunderCatze> 	bar.src = 'bar.png';
[15:44:18] <wunderCatze> that's it what I used
[15:44:28] <danheberden> ok
[15:44:31] <danheberden> so you set src
[15:44:31] <wunderCatze> and it's working now but I do not know why
[15:44:37] <wunderCatze> yes.
[15:44:41] <danheberden> but how do you know when it actually downloaded?
[15:44:44] <danheberden> and, like, made the image?
[15:44:56] <wunderCatze> I dont have to know when it's downloaded
[15:45:04] <wunderCatze> the image has near 300 bytes size
[15:45:05] <danheberden> obviously
[15:45:08] <danheberden> that's why you aren't having any problems
[15:45:10] <darrennnn> if anyone is familiar with jquery and jsfiddle, do you mind checking this? i am trying to teach myself to send an receive data using ajax but i have no idea why i am getting nothing back in the data variable. http://jsfiddle.net/drrncn/BSSb6/12/
[15:45:16] <wunderCatze> it's kinda... weird to dont download
[15:45:16] <danheberden> and are here in #jquery
[15:45:26] <danheberden> wunderCatze: it doesn't matter if it's 1byte
[15:45:35] <danheberden> it's an asynchronous operation
[15:45:44] <danheberden> you can't rely on that image data for a canvas element
[15:46:01] <danheberden> when the javascript parser will already be drawing canvas elements before your 300byte image is even loaded
[15:46:02] <wunderCatze> so you are saying that I must include an onload function?
[15:46:03] <danheberden> let alone downloaded
[15:46:10] <danheberden> wunderCatze: you need to respond to the load of the images
[15:46:31] <gnarf> ?imagesloaded
[15:46:32] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[15:46:56] <danheberden> $('<img src="whatever.jpg">').on( 'load', function(){ /* ALL DONE */ });
[15:47:18] <danheberden> or `var img = new Image(); img.src = "Wat.jpg"; img.onload = function() { /* all done */ };
[15:47:21] <danheberden> whatever
[15:47:37] <wunderCatze> so the .onload thing is kinda a must?
[15:49:22] <danheberden> yuppers
[15:49:37] <danheberden> whenever you're doing stuff that relies on the image data being there
[15:49:46] <danheberden> you gotta wait til, you know, the image data is there
[15:50:05] <danheberden> it's an asynchronous world out there
[15:51:01] <wunderCatze> is this good: http://pastebin.com/bZA49BBD
[15:51:15] <wunderCatze> can I now be sure that my image will load ?
[15:52:18] <danheberden> wunderCatze: sure, but, like, you ARE using jQuery
[15:52:26] <danheberden> so you can make that a little cleaner/simpler if you wanna
[15:52:39] <danheberden> so once it's loaded, then do your kinetic stuff
[15:52:43] <danheberden> in that function
[15:52:45] <wunderCatze> I am not using a <img> tag
[15:53:00] <wunderCatze> the image is dynamicaly loaded
[15:53:09] <danheberden> wunderCatze: var img = $('<img src="bar.png">') is the same thing
[15:53:10] <danheberden> but whatever
[15:53:11] <wunderCatze> i cant imagine how to make this code cleaner
[15:53:13] <danheberden> YOUR code
[15:53:21] <danheberden> i wouldn't listen to me either
[15:53:31] <wunderCatze> ok, tell me how you will do it
[15:53:36] <danheberden> i just did ;)
[15:53:54] <danheberden> though, actually, i would use deferreds if you had multiple images
[15:53:55] <gnarf> wunderCatze: new Image() actually creates a new <img> element if you take a look at the console.log() of it
[15:54:48] <wunderCatze> ok. and why my code isnt cleaner than img = $('<img src="bar.png">') ?
[15:54:51] <gnarf> wunderCatze: http://cl.ly/image/2e1g330R2X2Y
[15:55:13] <danheberden> wunderCatze: maybe just work on it working first
[15:55:19] <danheberden> you know what you need to do
[15:55:24] <danheberden> it doesn't matter how you do it
[15:55:36] <danheberden> it's just, you know, you're in #jquery support
[15:55:45] <danheberden> asking about kinetic.js, so figured i'd recommend 'the jquery way'
[15:56:10] <wunderCatze> well, I was just trying not to append the image to the document
[15:56:24] <wunderCatze> I just wanted to put an image as background of a rect
[15:56:26] <gnarf> wunderCatze: $( html ) doesn't append anything to the document
[15:56:31] <danheberden> wunderCatze: then don't append it
[15:56:36] <wunderCatze> that's why I used new Image();
[15:56:50] <danheberden> if you create shit, it doesn't just magically appear in the dom :p
[15:56:58] <wunderCatze> I tought that  $('<img src="bar.png">') will append the image to the document
[15:57:17] <danheberden> nope - $('<img src="bar.png">').appendTo( document ); will though
[15:57:19] <danheberden> well
[15:57:21] <danheberden> document.body
[15:57:36] <danheberden> or $('body').append( $('<img>') ); blah blah blah
[15:58:56] <wunderCatze> I swear that I am more confused now than before entering mIRC :)) haha
[15:58:58] <wunderCatze> ty
[15:59:11] <wunderCatze> now I'll get to work :D
[15:59:20] <danheberden> wunderCatze: i think because you're trying to fit what we're saying into your understanding
[15:59:30] <danheberden> instead of trying to see it differently
[15:59:32] <danheberden> it'll sink in
[15:59:36] <danheberden> one of these times at leats :)

[16:03:17] <danheberden> i was just trying to think up something witty about isPlainObject and weed
[16:03:57] <gnarf> danheberden: check this out
[16:04:02] <gnarf> i wrote a haiku about that comment
[16:04:44] <danheberden> Â¿donde?
[16:04:52] <awc737> hello, this function is returning false no matter what
[16:04:53] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9ah
[16:04:59] <gnarf> danheberden: https://gist.github.com/bb4d8fbf36b0d493c698
[16:05:04] <awc737> how do I tell it to wait until the ajax is done before returning?
[16:05:05] <danheberden> awc737: that reminds me of a slide
[16:05:12] <danheberden> from a slide deck i once wrote
[16:05:23] <danheberden> ?deferreds @ awc737
[16:05:23] <bot-t> awc737, Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[16:05:24] <gnarf> danheberden: the comment from that empty for ... in just was confusing to me
[16:05:37] <danheberden> hmm, wasn't there a factoid for the talk?
[16:06:00] <danheberden> awc737: but yeah, your function will return that undefined value WAY before your ajax call even thinks about starting
[16:06:01] <awc737> hmm
[16:06:03] <danheberden> let alone when it's done
[16:06:13] <gnarf> ?g dan heberden deferred video
[16:06:14] <danheberden> so return jQuery.ajax()
[16:06:15] <bot-t> gnarf, Deferreds - putting laziness to work - danheberden - http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/
[16:06:16] <awc737> theres a lot of stuff in this link :)
[16:06:19] <gnarf> that one dan?
[16:06:21] <danheberden> awc737: ^^
[16:06:21] <awc737> oh
[16:06:24] <awc737> i like that
[16:06:26] <danheberden> listen to me tell you about how this works
[16:06:29] <danheberden> haha
[16:06:43] <awc737> i like this slide
[16:07:04] <awc737> opening slide is the best!
[16:07:13] <danheberden> moar slides: http://danheberden.com/presentations/jqsummit-deferreds-in-jquery/
[16:07:29] <danheberden> (chrome only)
[16:08:31] <danheberden> this http://paste.laravel.com/ site seems simple and nice
[16:08:33] <danheberden> i like it
[16:09:13] <awc737> for my case, should I  bother with deferred
[16:09:19] <awc737> or just stick return in front of jQuery.ajax
[16:11:02] <coldhead> deferred will make you look like a cool guy
[16:11:09] <awc737> thats all i want
[16:11:35] <danheberden> awc737: returning jQuery.ajax IS returning a promise of the deferred $.ajax creates
[16:12:26] <awc737> but in my case, how would I make it return valid
[16:12:26] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9an
[16:14:14] <scar> what does the source for .ajax() look like?
[16:14:36] <grafi> ...
[16:16:24] <awc737> i'm confused implementing my ajax function to a defferred one
[16:21:08] <goddard> is there any way to speed up the ajax loading time?
[16:21:22] <goddard> i am doing an ajax call and it takes like 3 seconds
[16:26:38] <awc737> danheberden, I think I'm close to being cool: http://paste.laravel.com/9ao
[16:26:51] <awc737> so the ordering and waiting is correct
[16:27:05] <awc737> except I need the jQuery.ajax to return true or false
[16:27:20] <awc737> because I need the bardledoo().done( stuff to = true or false
[16:27:28] <awc737> so I can do valid = bardledoo().done
[16:28:38] <danheberden> you mean false if the ajax fails?
[16:28:44] <danheberden> or false if "data" is something weird
[16:28:57] <dblosevn> hey is there seriously no built in context menu for jqueryui?
[16:28:59] <wunderCatze> does anyone knows if kinetic.js cope with custom fonts like font-face? I am tring but no succeding
[16:29:29] <awc737> danheberden, i'd like to set true or false depending on the data
[16:29:35] <awc737> so if data is something wierd more like
[16:29:36] <danheberden> dblosevn: well, there's a menu widget
[16:29:51] <danheberden> i don't see why you couldn't use then when someone clicks their 2nd mouse button
[16:30:16] <danheberden> awc737: that function in done
[16:30:21] <danheberden> it gets the results of your ajax shit
[16:30:39] <danheberden> so, like, bardledoo().done( function( data ) {...
[16:30:43] <awc737> what results? data?
[16:30:56] <danheberden> yeah, it's in the docs yo
[16:31:01] <danheberden> ?jQuery.ajax
[16:31:02] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:31:16] <danheberden> ?g jquery deferred object
[16:31:18] <bot-t> danheberden, Deferred Object – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[16:31:23] <dblosevn> danheberden: thanks I think I can make that work
[16:31:38] <awc737> danheberden, i don't see how to return a true or false value though
[16:31:54] <awc737> I don't get what return jQuery.ajax is actually returning
[16:32:03] <danheberden> awc737: you should watch that presentation!
[16:32:05] <danheberden> it's returning a promise
[16:32:21] <danheberden> basically, an object that promises to either get resolved (.done()) or rejected (.fail())
[16:32:36] <danheberden> so you're basically returning a contract that something will happen
[16:32:43] <danheberden> and that function you pass into done?
[16:32:48] <danheberden> that .done( function(data){...}
[16:32:52] <awc737> yeah
[16:32:57] <danheberden> that gets executed when the ajax call succeeds
[16:33:09] <danheberden> or .fail( function(data){...} ) gets called when it fails
[16:33:14] <danheberden> and you got data, right there
[16:33:19] <danheberden> so you can check it and do stuff
[16:33:50] <awc737> so then danheberden , why doesn't this alert "something"
[16:33:51] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9aq
[16:33:59] <awc737> I set data = 'something'
[16:34:30] <danheberden> yeah, in your success callback
[16:34:34] <danheberden> what is that url returning?
[16:34:40] <danheberden> index.php?option=... blah blah blah
[16:34:48] <awc737> uhh, actually nothing it was a test
[16:34:51] <awc737> i can make it return true or false
[16:35:08] <awc737> can I delete the success: callback, since bardledoo().done is already waiting?
[16:35:47] <danheberden> awc737: http://paste.laravel.com/9ar
[16:35:51] <danheberden> aye
[16:36:02] <danheberden> in that case you could just do $.ajax( ur );
[16:36:04] <danheberden> *url
[16:36:26] <awc737> thank you danheberden
[16:38:44] <Auger> recommend any libraries for growing divs?

[16:55:26] <praxx> okay, anybody could help me with .prop() and IE?
[17:01:55] <wunderCatze> is there a kinetic.js channel or something where you can get instant help?
[17:02:44] <scar> wunderCatze: INSTANT, FREE help? where is that?
[17:03:03] <grafi> ^^
[17:03:35] <awc737> danheberden, I am so close.... http://paste.laravel.com/9aC
[17:03:48] <awc737> but I need something to be true or false lol
[17:06:16] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9aD
[17:06:31] <danheberden> what's with this returning true/false
[17:06:32] <danheberden> like, why
[17:06:33] <danheberden> where
[17:06:42] <danheberden> wherever it is that you need true or false
[17:06:47] <danheberden> is where .done(function(){ goes
[17:06:49] <danheberden> ya dig?
[17:07:09] <danheberden> the alert has to be INSIDE of the .done(function()...
[17:07:19] <wunderCatze> @scar: like here, lol?
[17:07:40] <danheberden> or var myDoneFunction = function(data){ alert(data); }; bardledoo().done( myDoneFunction );
[17:07:42] <danheberden> whatever
[17:07:45] <awc737> danheberden, but the valid variable is outside the .done function
[17:07:55] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9aE
[17:08:05] <awc737> see where alert(something) is, thats where I need valid = true or false
[17:08:19] <awc737> well actually above that, where you see // valid = bardledoo()
[17:08:42] <batmanbond3d> I am build a recorder for an esigning ceremony
[17:08:54] <danheberden> awc737: i'm not familiar with "JFormValidator"
[17:09:08] <awc737> well that bit is irrelevant
[17:09:15] <danheberden> it very much isn't
[17:09:17] <awc737> just that I need valid = true/false; where valid=bardledoo
[17:09:22] <batmanbond3d> I need to resize the window with a CSS scale transform to that in which the size the window was originally viewed when the document is being signed
[17:09:25] <danheberden> you're asking for impossible
[17:09:26] <batmanbond3d> http://66.131.121.129:8282/index.html#Replayer/gqMNFa0qvhiPoyofJZKc44pI5p0=/userAgent
[17:09:36] <danheberden> you need a different way to invalidate that form element
[17:09:39] <danheberden> or form
[17:09:53] <batmanbond3d> it works in IE7, IE9, Chrome, Sarari and Firefox but won't work in IE8
[17:10:00] <danheberden> like the form needs to be paused/disabled/whatever while you wait for the ajax request
[17:10:07] <batmanbond3d> it seems IE8 is just ignoring the css transform
[17:10:30] <batmanbond3d> can someone let me know what I am doing wrong?
[17:10:35] <danheberden> awc737: the problem is isValid() is going to run and finish WAY before your ajax operation
[17:11:13] <danheberden> awc737: is there a way you can manually invalidate with this plugin?
[17:11:15] <awc737> i don't know danheberden , the order seemed correct when I was just alerting stuff all over the place
[17:11:32] <awc737> i need to take a few steps back
[17:11:34] <danheberden> like, in your .done() function, you still have access to 'form'
[17:11:37] <danheberden> awc737: aye
[17:11:48] <danheberden> so from there, you can invalidate the form manually
[17:12:05] <awc737> well I invalidate the form manually by simple setting valid = false;
[17:12:08] <awc737> like you can see on line 12
[17:12:17] <awc737> so If I can do that again in line 21 I will be golden
[17:12:20] <danheberden> awc737: aye, but you want to use ajax to do stuff
[17:12:25] <danheberden> so that function it going to complete
[17:12:27] <danheberden> with or without you
[17:12:32] <danheberden> so you need a way to hook back in
[17:12:37] <danheberden> and say "uh oh"
[17:12:43] <danheberden> like - what if your ajax call took 5 seconds
[17:12:46] <danheberden> it probably doesn't
[17:12:49] <danheberden> but think of it in that way
[17:12:52] <danheberden> what does it look like?
[17:13:10] <danheberden> does the whole app just hang and crash the browser? does the form disable and say "working..." or something?
[17:13:15] <danheberden> and what happens when that's done?
[17:13:16] <awc737> well if it takes 5 seconds, and valid is = to the function, it seemed to be fine, and alert() before the page refreshed
[17:13:24] <danheberden> how do your succcess say "ok, form, you're good"
[17:13:28] <danheberden> or "back the fuck up, form"
[17:13:32] <awc737> lol
[17:13:39] <danheberden> awc737: you get the part of where valid is done, right?
[17:13:44] <danheberden> that function executes
[17:13:44] <danheberden> finishes
[17:13:46] <danheberden> done
[17:13:47] <danheberden> all done
[17:13:59] <danheberden> that plugin doens't care about that variable
[17:14:02] <danheberden> after that
[17:14:14] <danheberden> it runs, it sees valid, and then valid is swept away in the ether of the browser
[17:14:18] <danheberden> then your ajax call finishes
[17:14:27] <danheberden> and it sets valid
[17:14:28] <awc737> ok I see
[17:14:31] <danheberden> but, like, your form thingy
[17:14:33] <danheberden> it already used valid
[17:14:36] <danheberden> it already acted
[17:14:49] <danheberden> and there's no, like, "oh, valid changed" feature :p
[17:14:50] <awc737> where?
[17:15:04] <danheberden> your form validator, upon submit (i assume) calls that isValid metho
[17:15:06] <danheberden> *method
[17:15:10] <danheberden> or on change, either way
[17:15:16] <danheberden> so it sets valid to true
[17:15:19] <danheberden> runs an ajax request
[17:15:22] <danheberden> then returns valid
[17:15:23] <danheberden> which is true
[17:15:36] <danheberden> then, X milliseconds later, your ajax stuff finishes up
[17:15:46] <danheberden> but, like, you already returned valid=true
[17:15:53] <batmanbond3d> Can anyone help?
[17:15:56] <awc737> yeah I see
[17:16:01] <batmanbond3d> http://66.131.121.129:8282/index.html#Replayer/gqMNFa0qvhiPoyofJZKc44pI5p0=/userAgent
[17:16:05] <danheberden> so you need a way to control that yourself
[17:16:09] <danheberden> and say "form, you're valid"
[17:16:12] <danheberden> or "form, you aren't valid"
[17:16:18] <danheberden> in that .done() handler
[17:16:26] <awc737> but on line 19, if that statement is true, it's going to wait until my ajax function finishes right?
[17:16:41] <danheberden> js don't wait for no one
[17:16:44] <danheberden> it's all about callbacks
[17:16:47] <awc737> if a variable is set to a function .done promise or whatever, it's going to get that variable right
[17:16:50] <danheberden> hence it being 'asyncronous'
[17:17:06] <danheberden> nah, it's just getting an object that holds functions to execute
[17:17:12] <awc737> damn
[17:17:14] <danheberden> ?jqf @ awc737

[17:18:55] <awc737> thanks danheberden i need to look at it a bit more
[17:19:21] <grafi> what the frack ...
[17:22:47] <batmanbond3d> danheberden: ya, the code isn't minified
[17:23:12] <danheberden> ITS SO BIG! (twss)
[17:23:18] <batmanbond3d> danheberden: but I think it is just a CSS issue
[17:23:40] <batmanbond3d> and I can't isolate the problem
[18:09:43] <reubenh> Hi. Just want to check something here before submitting a possible bug to the tracker. This link [http://jsfiddle.net/reubenhelms/ZtZu8/] shows usage of a buttonset, though also includes a hidden field with the same name that is used to show the server that no items were selected
[18:10:10] <reubenh> When selecting a button, the buttonset breaks, becase of the hidden field with the same name
[18:11:36] <reubenh> Should the mechanic be restricted to <inputs> of the same type (i.e. all radio items, rather than including hidden items as well)?
[18:46:16] <raj> by the power vested in me, I request sshoookkkkyyy (shoky)
[18:46:48] <Eviltwin> For some reason I don't think he highlights on sshoookkkkyyy
[18:47:30] <raj> `(shoky)` either?
[18:48:30] <raj> Eviltwin, can I PM you for some non-jquery advice?
[18:48:48] <raj> ...my rash resolved...but... ;)
[18:49:15] <ngharo> 0_o
[18:50:41] <grafi> interesting raj
[18:50:42] <grafi> :P
[19:09:01] <fission6> damn js can do list comprehensions in firefox
[19:09:33] <grafi> what are list comprehensions :o
[19:09:47] <fission6> i = [1,2,3,4]
[19:10:46] <fission6> new_i = [i * 2 for each (i in numbers)]
[19:10:54] <grafi> i see
[19:11:33] <grafi> not that i see how that could be useful to me ^^
[19:11:55] <fission6> its handy here and there
[19:12:04] <fission6> and apparently there are iterators and generators
[19:12:40] <adlwalrus> can anyone offer advice as to why my tooltip isn't working? http://jsbin.com/ucodir/1/quiet
[19:12:52] <adlwalrus> hover on the  blue... its throwing exceptions left and right.
[19:13:17] <grafi> its throws tooltips left and right adlwalrus ^^
[19:13:41] <adlwalrus> grafi: ??
[19:14:00] <grafi> "This shd display in a tooltip."
[19:14:25] <adlwalrus> grafi: what are you sayinhg? it should, but it doesn't.
[19:14:52] <adlwalrus> I just get the native browser's "foo baz qux"
[19:15:07] <grafi> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/43313739/tiptool.JPG
[19:35:31] <acidjazz> i got kind of a generic ?.. so i just wrote an entire login/registration form front and back.. ive noticed my browsers arent asking to save the data.. is there any spec on how browsers determine and store this?
[19:42:37] <adlwalrus> grafi: that's so weird! what browser were you using?
[19:42:48] <adlwalrus> I didn't get a single one. only a bunch of exceptions.
[19:42:53] <grafi> firefox
[19:43:04] <grafi> aurora to be precise
[19:43:43] <grafi> when I open up firebug I see some errors too, but that doesnt stop it from working
[19:44:26] <adlwalrus> grafi: ah, ok.
[19:44:37] <adlwalrus> in chrome it doesn't work.
[19:46:19] <acidjazz> so basically where can i find a spec on what browsers look for to initiate remember-me
[19:47:07] <grafi> have fun on your quest acidjazz
[19:49:30] <adlwalrus> grafi: any ideas on getting it fixed
[19:49:32] <adlwalrus> ?
[19:49:41] <adlwalrus> acidjazz: a few different factors...
[19:49:51] <adlwalrus> by far #1 is cookies.
[19:50:01] <grafi> not really sure what bonzo is ^^
[19:50:03] <adlwalrus> acidjazz: ip address might be second.
[19:50:06] <adlwalrus> ua string
[19:50:10] <adlwalrus> grafi: it's a dom utility
[19:50:19] <adlwalrus> like part of jquery but way lighterweight.
[19:50:22] <grafi> thats what google says :p
[19:50:38] <adlwalrus> acidjazz: try checking out browserspy.dk
[19:50:47] <adlwalrus> acidjazz: and panopticlick.eff.org
[19:50:59] <grafi> ReferenceError: $felineTip is not defined
[19:50:59] <grafi> $felineTip.fade('out', function(){
[19:51:54] <grafi> look like whatever felineTip is is not there ... so maybe put it in a cage and throw the key away
[19:52:16] <grafi> dont lose the cage though :P
[19:53:38] <Alpha64> hello i have one accordion working but this one is not, any ideas ? http://pastebin.com/BeZasnen the loaded php is this> http://pastebin.com/9enfqm5m
[19:53:56] <fission6> is there  away to load the html from another side into the dom without gettin same policy issues, or to make an iframe and interact with it
[19:54:18] <grafi> still on that problem fission6?
[19:56:25] <fission6> nope
[19:56:39] <fission6> i want to make a knockoff of lmgtfy for a forum i am on
[19:56:56] <fission6> and i dont want to have to copy and serve an imitation of their search pag
[19:56:58] <fission6> page
[19:58:29] <thinkdevcode> couldnt you theoretically do a $.get on the site u want?
[19:59:04] <fission6> cross domain
[19:59:09] <fission6> same origin
[19:59:12] <fission6> etc
[19:59:14] <grafi> evil evil ^^
[19:59:19] <thinkdevcode> $.get's work cross domain?
[19:59:28] <adlwalrus> grafi: oh, that could be the bug!
[19:59:37] <thinkdevcode> the other http verbs dont
[19:59:46] <adlwalrus> grafi: actually, wait. what?
[19:59:47] <fission6> maybe for jsonp
[19:59:59] <adlwalrus> what were you suggesting?
[20:00:07] <grafi> xD
[20:00:09] <thinkdevcode> whats your backend?
[20:00:21] <fission6> are you asking me
[20:00:28] <thinkdevcode> yes
[20:00:32] <fission6> ideally nothing
[20:00:40] <fission6> otherwise this wouldn't be an issue
[20:06:08] <thinkdevcode> cant think of anything then, if its just clientside
[20:08:29] <fission6> yea oh well
[20:36:39] <Alpha64> i've got a small problem with jquery-ui , it's not making an accordion, any ideas? http://pastebin.com/BeZasnen the loaded php is this> http://pastebin.com/9enfqm5m
[20:37:35] <Cork> Alpha64: $(document).ready(cargarTareas()); is not what you want
[20:37:47] <Cork> taht won't wait for ready
[20:37:51] <Cork> *that
[20:38:41] <Alpha64> and when is it firing?
[20:38:42] <Cork> Alpha64: additionally, you're not waiting for the load calls to fetch the content
[20:38:51] <Cork> Alpha64: when the browser parses that line
[20:39:00] <Cork> $(document).ready(cargarTareas()) is the same as
[20:39:01] <Alpha64> oh man i feel so dumb, yeah forgot to callback
[20:39:20] <Cork> var r = cargarTareas(); $(document).ready(r)
[20:39:43] <Cork> Alpha64: all the code there is racy
[20:40:33] <Cork> cargarTareas doesn't wait for read; accordeon doesn't wait for cararTareas, and what ever uses cararPartes doesn't wait for it
[20:42:12] <Cork> Alpha64: btw ready is pointless if you put your code in body
[20:42:33] <Cork> Alpha64: it only has a meaning if you have your code in head
[20:44:59] <Alpha64> http://pastebin.com/8U58JCms is this better?
[20:45:17] <Cork> yes
[20:45:26] <Cork> oh, wait no
[20:45:31] <Cork> you don't need line 6
[20:45:56] <Cork> load will still add the response to the dom
[20:46:01] <Cork> you just have to wait for it
[20:46:33] <Cork> ?jquery.load
[20:46:36] <bot-t> Cork, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:47:07] <Alpha64> http://i.imgur.com/X2wx7.png now it's making this weird thing
[20:47:24] <Cork> ?p @ Alpha64
[20:47:25] <bot-t> Alpha64, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:47:30] <Cork> or a live link
[20:47:58] <Cork> (simplest is to emulate the ajax call if your doing it on jsfiddle)
[21:01:25] <Alpha64> i solved it, i had to use another selector, thanks
[21:02:10] <Alpha64> how would you go about storing a number inside  a header, to use it as a parameter when the tab header is clicked?
[21:02:28] <Cork> inside a header?
[21:02:34] <CWSpear> table header?
[21:02:34] <Cork> you mean a <h1> tag?
[21:02:39] <Alpha64> yeah
[21:03:02] <Cork> which one?
[21:04:01] <Alpha64> each accordion element is composed of <hn> ads </hn><div> something</div> , and when the user clicks the header to open the tab
[21:04:15] <Alpha64> i want to know a certain number associated with it
[21:04:30] <Cork> data-number="<num>"
[21:04:46] <Cork> (number can be what ever you want)
[21:05:41] <Alpha64> so then i $("#selector").data(number)? or something like that?
[21:05:57] <Cork> $("#selector").data('number') yes
[21:06:17] <Alpha64> oh great
[21:14:48] <Alpha64> $("#tasks #orders > h3").click(function(e){alert("Datos:>" + $(e).data("ot"))}); this is alerting undefined, but probably i'm wrong with the $(3) thing
[21:15:00] <Alpha64> $(e)
[21:15:43] <Cork> uh e?
[21:15:45] <Cork> e is event
[21:15:50] <Cork> you want $(this)
[21:16:11] <abjorn> psh

[21:17:37] <abjorn> im drunk and playing pokemon

[21:37:00] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_with_fraudulent_diplomas why is this a thing
[21:37:41] <Cork> animals with diplomas.. heh
[22:03:01] <Whirl3d> agunia, is it textarea.val() or textarea.text() that you are looking for?
[22:04:18] <Whirl3d> oh and perhaps you need to specify which textarea
[22:05:46] <Whirl3d> sorry, I avoid using the $naming convention for just that reason---i misread. $textarea for $('textarea')
[22:12:16] <Alpha64> say i want the div #something from $(this) , how is that?
[22:12:36] <RigidWig> Hello all. Is there some way, through JQuery, to switch the source URL of an embedded (.wmv) <object> (with a null source) and have it load the new video sourrce?
[22:12:47] <Cork> Alpha64: you're missing some context there
[22:13:15] <Cork> Alpha64: $(this) only have a meaning in .each or event handlers
[22:13:22] <Alpha64> a $("something").click( function (){ $(this) etc
[22:13:42] <Cork> $(this) will be the div
[22:13:48] <Cork> or do you mean the raw dom element?
[22:14:09] <Alpha64> i want to address something inside the this element
[22:14:21] <Cork> $(this).find('selector')
[22:14:34] <dblosevn> what he said
[22:14:37] <Alpha64> oh cool thanks
[22:14:40] <Cork> Alpha64: though that's useless if your using id's
[22:14:51] <Cork> Alpha64: id's have to be uniq in the entire page
[22:14:53] <Alpha64> and how would ago with an id?
[22:15:00] <Cork> $('#the-id')
[22:15:26] <Cork> your page is invalid if you have multiple elements with the same id
[22:15:56] <Alpha64> i guess so :(
[22:15:58] <Cork> RigidWig: sure just change the src attribute
[22:16:18] <RigidWig> the problem is that the src attribute is this random parameter
[22:16:30] <RigidWig> and when I change it, nothing happens... I get no new video loaded up
[22:16:32] <Cork> Alpha64: you would have to use $(this).find('div[id="local-id"]')
[22:16:49] <RigidWig> I tried it through Jquery Media plugin where changing the href would acheive the same thing, but still nothing...
[22:16:50] <dblosevn> youd use find for somethin like $(this).find('li a').attr('href') you wouldnt want to find an id within $(this) as it should be unique unless $(this) is an iframe
[22:16:58] <Cork> Alpha64: though know, that that's not an id, just an attribute on a dom element
[22:17:25] <Cork> dblosevn: and if $(this) was an iframe you wouldn't find anything :)
[22:17:34] <Cork> you need .contents() for those
[22:17:37] <dblosevn> well an iframes document
[22:18:20] <dblosevn> which could have an id that also is in the parents dom lol
[22:18:24] <Cork> RigidWig: ya, replaced elements doesn't always listen for dom changes
[22:18:35] <Cork> RigidWig: you might actually have to replace the entire element
[22:18:57] <dblosevn> ya i have never got delgation to work for me i just unbind all and rebind
[22:19:03] <Cork> dblosevn: it's two completely separate documents, so not sure how that matters
[22:19:50] <dblosevn> when i dont have a reference to the objects i am adding to the dom anyways
[22:20:02] <rhino__> what is the jquery equivalent to document.myform.diagnosis ??
[22:20:41] <dblosevn> rhino__: is diagnosis a custom method?
[22:20:51] <Cork> rhino__: $('form[name="myform"] *[name="diagnosis"]')
[22:21:13] <RigidWig> Cork: I actually tried that, as in: onComplete: $('div#whatever').html('<object thing="whatever" another="whatever"> param param blah blah etc etc'); but when I did that, I found that the CSS didn't come up right so I am assuming something bad happenned....
[22:21:17] <dblosevn> oh field name lol
[22:21:18] <Cork> rhino__: you're better of using id for the form
[22:21:39] <Cork> rhino__: the form element's is fine though
[22:22:20] <Cork> RigidWig: onComplete: $... or onComplete: function() { $... ?
[22:22:47] <Cork> RigidWig: check if the object element has any style tags
[22:22:51] <RigidWig> Cork: onComplete is a callback from php for uploadify...
[22:23:00] <dblosevn> Cork: thats neat i use something like 					$('#add-edit-type').find('input[name="type_id"]').val(ret.type.type_id);
[22:23:02] <RigidWig> might it have been the interchangability of the " and ' ? is there a cleaner way to do something like this cause the way I do it seems messy
[22:23:25] <dblosevn> is your selector faster?
[22:23:26] <Cork> RigidWig: ' and " is fine
[22:23:55] <Cork> dblosevn: no, but his example doens't have an id for the form
[22:24:26] <Cork> document.myform is <form name="myform">
[22:24:47] <Cork> and its old ie compatibility code :/
[22:24:54] <dblosevn> so $('#add-edit-form *input[name="type_id"]') wouldnt work?
[22:25:09] <Cork> no but $('#add-edit-form input[name="type_id"]') would
[22:25:25] <Cork> and yes that would be slightly faster
[22:25:28] <dblosevn> duh no clue why i did find
[22:26:28] <dblosevn> ive had issues in the past with parent [space] child before if child wasnt a direcrect decendant of parent is probally why
[22:26:38] <dblosevn> *direct
[22:26:57] <Cork> dblosevn: $('#add-edit-form input[name="type_id"]') will do document.querySelectorAll('#add-edit-form input[name="type_id"]')
[22:27:30] <Cork> dblosevn: while $('#add-edit-form').find('input[name="type_id"]') will do document.getElementById('#add-edit-form').querySelectorAll('input[name="type_id"]')
[22:27:45] <Cork> there is a difference, but its small
[22:28:46] <Cork> dblosevn: not sure what you mean there
[22:29:13] <Cork> bah, i meant document.getElementById('add-edit-form').querySelectorAll('input[name="type_id"]')
[22:30:10] <dblosevn> eg... form#myform input[name='myfield'] doesnt always select if myfield was actually form table tbody tr ul li label input[name='myfield']
[22:30:29] <dblosevn> thats a silly example but what im talking about
[22:30:45] <Cork> form#myform is pointless
[22:30:54] <Cork> form there only makes the selector slower
[22:30:58] <dblosevn> ya i know, just for illusration
[22:31:19] <Cork> never ever had that problem my self
[22:31:26] <dblosevn> i wouldnt do that was just identifiying that #myform was a form
[22:31:53] <Cork> though i quite rarely use id's
[22:32:18] <dblosevn> i usually use ids as wrappers and then i find what im looking for from there
[22:32:39] <Cork> i try to always write my code so its controlled by the html
[22:32:48] <Cork> that way you don't have to rewrite it all the time
[22:33:18] <dblosevn> eg form with an id then find my fields from there
[22:33:29] <dblosevn> im too lazy to give everything ids
[22:33:44] <Cork> and most of the time it just makes the code harder to maintain
[22:33:48] <dblosevn> but i have a lot of instances where there is more then one form on the page with fields with the same names
[22:34:05] <Cork> faster to develop, but needs more manual fixes over its life time
[22:34:48] <Cork> dblosevn: what i meant is i ex. write a validator that handles submissions on all form tags, through the submit tag
[22:34:57] <dblosevn> timers ticking down think i start on that catepillar android app next week
[22:35:02] <Cork> dblosevn: and if the form should be ajax, i set a "ajaxform" class on it
[22:35:04] <Cork> and so on
[22:35:12] <dblosevn> oh i never eg all my fields i use form.serialize
[22:35:14] <Cork> so classes set what the js does
[22:35:18] <dblosevn> *get
[22:35:36] <dblosevn> only when i need to set them do i find them
[22:36:30] <dblosevn> oh i finally got that drag drop thing to work, i couldnt add a button to the sortable rows
[22:36:42] <dblosevn> it made the damn droppable fire
[22:36:57] <dblosevn> ended up adding a context menu to delete
[22:38:50] <dblosevn> is there anyway to fix the sortable though so you can actually drag an item to the top of the list?
[22:39:00] <dblosevn> seems buggy at best
[22:39:21] <dblosevn> sometimes it works others it just snaps the item back where it was in the list
[22:39:24] <Cork> dblosevn: yes, but it depends on the css used quite a bit
[22:39:37] <Cork> dblosevn: margins and so forth matters a lot
[22:40:03] <dblosevn> started happening when i added constraint: parent
[22:41:32] <dblosevn> 11px top bottom margin, 0 left and right no padding no border
[22:44:47] <rhino__> Cork:  I'm trying to create an array of all inputs ids in a form
[22:45:40] <Cork> rhino__: $.map($('form input'), function(elm) { return elm.id; })
[22:46:14] <dblosevn> rhino: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[22:46:25] <rhino__> Cork, tnx
[22:46:27] <Cork> that won't give you the id's though
[22:46:30] <Cork> dblosevn: ^
[22:46:41] <Cork> rhino__: np
[22:46:46] <dblosevn> oh back to giving every element an id
[22:46:51] <dblosevn> lol
[22:47:11] <Cork> rhino__: that said, ya; why do you need to have an array of the input elements id's ?
[22:47:39] <rhino__> Cork:  that's basically the same as   document.myform.diagnosis where diagnosis is the name of all of the inputs
[22:48:09] <rhino__> Cork:  jacked up code someone else wrote that I'm having to patch quickly
[22:48:33] <Cork> ah
[22:48:43] <Cork> legacy code is always fun to get
[22:49:07] <Cork> i tend to always fix legacy pages instead of just hacking it
[22:49:12] <Cork> its a win in the long run
[22:51:16] <dblosevn> ^usually faster then trying to figure out how to hack it together
[22:51:47] <rhino__> Cork:  will $.map('form .diagnosis') give me the same array but using the class instead?
[22:52:44] <Cork> rhino__: the selector will, but not the way you're using it
[22:53:18] <Cork> $.map only takes an array
[22:53:19] <Whirl3d> when you have a variable that might contain a string (representing the ID of an object) or a reference to a html element or a jquery object, what is the best way to ensure that you have a jquery object containing an html Element in the end...and by best, I mean is there a way to avoid ducktyping the variable?
[22:53:30] <Cork> it doens't support selectors
[22:53:44] <Cork> thats why you need to do $.map($('form .diagnosis'))
[22:54:19] <rhino__> well, how do I need to do it?  here is a pastie of my code  http://pastie.org/5159726
[22:54:29] <rhino__> Cork: ^^
[22:55:12] <Cork> rhino__: i gave you the code before
[22:55:21] <Cork> you only need to replace the selector string
[22:56:37] <rhino__> cork:  ah, so replace 'form' in your code w/ my form name?
[22:56:54] <Cork> no form names has to be located as an attribute
[22:57:04] <Cork> form[name="form-name"]
[22:57:40] <rhino__> so if my form is called myform, what would my map statement look like?
[22:57:47] <rhino__> Cork:  ^^
[22:59:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: typeof(arg) === 'string' || arg.jquery !== undefined
[22:59:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: you might want to check typepf(arg) === 'object' too
[22:59:44] <Whirl3d> lol. much easier than: holder=holder && holder.length && holder.jquery?holder:holder && $(holder).length?$(holder):holder && $("#"+holder).length?$("#"+holder):config.holder;
[23:00:24] <Whirl3d> thanks Cork. Always a pleasure.
[23:00:42] <Cork> yw :)
[23:02:24] * coldhead np: sonic youth - bull in the heather
[23:02:29] <rhino__> Cork:  following your example, I came up w/ this, but I know it's not right, where am I going wrong?  $.map('form[name="myform"] input')
[23:02:48] <Cork> ?jquery.map @ rhino__
[23:02:50] <bot-t> rhino__, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[23:03:01] <Cork> rhino__: map tags an array not a selector string
[23:03:20] <Cork> rhino__: the code i gave you was => $.map($('form input'), function(elm) { return elm.id; })
[23:03:54] <Cork> you're constantly removing the jquery query call
[23:04:28] <Cork> *map takes
[23:10:57] <pradip110033> hi
[23:12:08] <coldhead> hi pradipsy
[23:13:01] <pradip110033> how to hide and show on radio button selection
[23:13:50] <Cork> hide the selection?
[23:14:05] <Cork> you mean make none of the buttons marked?
[23:14:37] <pradip110033> i have two radio button 'Yes' and 'No', when user selects yes one div should get display and on 'no' radio button selection same div shld get hide
[23:15:05] <Cork> pradip110033: bind a click event on the elements
[23:16:58] <pradip110033> i hv another query, i need to make all characters entered in text box by user to upper case, and post the details to controller in upper case only
[23:18:20] <Cork> pradip110033: http://jsfiddle.net/3wyNb/
[23:18:24] <dblosevn> rhino__: thats how i would write it http://jsfiddle.net/p4U2M/
[23:18:52] <pradip110033> @cork: thanks
[23:18:52] <b-ot> pradip110033, I'm a bot you know...
[23:19:00] <Cork> O_o
[23:19:09] * Cork hits b-t
[23:19:59] <Cork> dblosevn: that list should really be using radio buttons instead...
[23:20:12] <rhino__> Cork, dblosevn:  tnx guys, I finally figured it out
[23:20:12] <dblosevn> ya i didnt change his html
[23:20:23] <Cork> did he post it here?
[23:20:30] <Cork> totally missed it if he did
[23:20:31] <dblosevn> only changed the legacy js out with jquery
[23:20:33] <dblosevn> ya
[23:20:55] <dblosevn> he pasted this http://pastie.org/5159726
[23:21:00] <dblosevn> I made the fiddle
[23:21:06] <dblosevn> 3 lines lol
[23:21:08] <Cork> ah
[23:21:13] <dblosevn> replced like 500 chars of js
[23:21:30] <Cork> rhino__: you're simplest solution would be to juse change the type checkbox to type radio
[23:21:44] <Willman> b-ot
[23:21:49] <Cork> rhino__: no use recrating radio buttons in js when it works by default
[23:21:55] <Cork> *recreating
[23:22:15] <dblosevn> ive had clients that insited on checkboxes in the past when radios were more for the job
[23:22:18] <rhino__> Cork, I completely agree, but the bossman wants checkboxes, lol
[23:22:26] <dblosevn> especially in the medical field
[23:22:31] <Cork> oh, for *** sake...
[23:22:46] <dblosevn> thats what i say
[23:22:46] <Cork> why do ppl love breaking web standards?
[23:22:52] <dblosevn> recreating the wheel
[23:22:58] <rhino__> idiots
[23:23:04] <Cork> that solution will break every client that doens't have js
[23:23:09] <dblosevn> because they dont know them and expect us to bend them to there desires
[23:23:14] <Cork> and it will break aria support :/
[23:23:26] <Cork> (for ppl that can't see)
[23:23:50] <Cork> i would never accept to do it
[23:24:20] <Cork> i would fight it will all i had to get them to understand the consequence of doing it that way
[23:25:13] <dblosevn> most of my clients listen to me but i got a couple that are dead set in there ways the psd is god
[23:25:34] <Cork> dblosevn: so use radio elements, and images!
[23:25:41] <dblosevn> lol
[23:25:44] <Cork> css to the rescue!
[23:25:48] <dblosevn> even more work
[23:25:51] <Cork> no its not
[23:26:01] <Cork> its just 3 lines of css :)
[23:26:15] <dblosevn> most of the stuff i do for thoughs guys is extjs anyways so it wont work at all without js
[23:26:28] <Cork> as it is that sites broken and unusable for ppl that's blind

[23:56:45] <RWOverdijk> How do I trigger an event (custom event) and set the "this" context to a DOMElement for the listeners?
[23:57:55] <RWOverdijk> I know I can just use .trigger(), but I'm not triggering on an element. So I want to be able to set the context
