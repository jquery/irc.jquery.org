[00:00:00] <jtm> Anyway, sorry it took a while to reply, I had to filter all the data down.
[00:00:08] <jtm> It still works perfectly with jsfiddler
[00:00:16] <shoky> and the html?
[00:00:18] <jtm> I'm going to comment out some of the code...
[00:01:12] <jtm> Maybe it's simply too much data?
[00:01:32] <shoky> does it work with less?
[00:01:37] <jtm> It works perfectly when I get rid of .hide() and just pass in data to the append
[00:01:41] <shoky> ah
[00:02:22] <jtm> http://pastebin.com/zndi1UHj
[00:03:43] <shoky> the html is just a bunch of <tr>'s one after another?
[00:03:55] <Abhijit> hi guys this is my jquery code http://paste.ubuntu.com/1420526/ and this is as.php http://paste.ubuntu.com/1420528/ and thsi is jsob.php http://paste.ubuntu.com/1420527/ it shows red ink for both php file in firebug
[00:03:55] <jtm> Well <tr> and <td>
[00:03:57] <Abhijit> it do not work
[00:03:58] <Abhijit> help please
[00:04:02] <Abhijit> shoky, ^
[00:04:03] <shoky> <td>'s are children of the <tr>
[00:04:11] <shoky> i'm asking about the top-level elements in your html
[00:04:25] <jtm> http://jsfiddle.net/p5DSb/12/
[00:04:33] <jtm> You can see some sample of the data
[00:05:01] <jtm> I made it highly convoluted on purpose :)
[00:05:31] <jtm> It's ~10 times more data than this.
[00:05:39] <jtm> Same thing though, repeated.
[00:06:28] <ravenzz> jtm you could try to append and fadeIn within the hide() callback
[00:06:31] <shoky> well, get it to error in the fiddle :P
[00:06:45] <jtm> I can't lol
[00:06:52] <tw2113> shoky, ever seen the movie Piranha?
[00:07:04] <ravenzz> like $foo.hide(function () { $(this).appendTo($bar).fadeIn(); })
[00:07:07] <shoky> tw2113: part of it, many many years ago :p
[00:07:10] <jtm> ravenzz I'll check
[00:07:19] <jtm> ok lets see
[00:07:24] <shoky> tw2113: or are you talking about something new
[00:07:31] <tw2113> 2010 movie of the same name
[00:07:36] <shoky> ah, nope
[00:07:44] <Abhijit> how can i make everything stop until ajax php call has finisehd processing and returns result?
[00:07:58] <ravenzz> Abhijit define everything.
[00:08:34] <Abhijit> ravenzz, it seems that when i call php using ajax it has only falf finished when the page reloads and just discards everything that ajax call started.
[00:08:43] <Abhijit> so i want it to finish ajax call and do the proccessing first
[00:08:57] <shoky> jtm: have the <tr>s be hidden in the first place with css
[00:09:18] <ravenzz> Abhijit do you have a form? or what
[00:09:58] <jtm> ravenzz I used your code, didn't solve it. Still the issue occurs with document type IE9
[00:10:13] <jtm> shoky then do an .after() with :last ?
[00:10:14] <Abhijit> ravenzz, yes a form
[00:10:23] <shoky> jtm: what?
[00:10:24] <ravenzz> ?preventdefault @ Abhijit
[00:10:24] <bot-t> Abhijit, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:10:28] <jtm> Since I'll have a class associated with the rows
[00:10:32] <shoky> jtm: then do the same thing you're doing, except the .hide() call
[00:10:44] <jtm> I could do .after on the :last, instead of appending
[00:10:59] <shoky> why?
[00:11:16] <jtm> It was another solution to append.
[00:11:22] <shoky> appending is fine
[00:11:43] <jtm> I think IE has issues with appending <tr>, or at least it seems this way.
[00:11:57] <jtm> I'll do 1 call at a time
[00:11:58] <jtm> :)
[00:11:58] <shoky> you said that if you just leave the .append, it works
[00:12:01] <shoky> so..
[00:12:15] <jtm> by the way this works perfect in all other browsers
[00:12:28] <shoky> anyway also calling .fadeIn  on many rows is yucky
[00:12:28] <tw2113> IE has so many issues
[00:12:52] <shoky> it fades in each one seperately
[00:13:21] <jtm> shoky The only issue with using CSS for hiding is that it would make the code a bit more complex
[00:13:26] <jtm> Due to the fact I already have rows
[00:13:33] <jtm> and they would be hidden by default
[00:13:43] <jtm> since they simply just include the template for the ajax call
[00:13:45] <Abhijit> ravenzz, no that will prevent the default form submit action. i wnat both action
[00:14:04] <shoky> jtm: is adding a new <tbody> each time no good?
[00:14:11] <shoky> .posts instead of #posts
[00:14:27] <jtm> Well I wouldn't really want that
[00:14:28] <ravenzz> Abhijit you should prevent it, and than redirect within the ajax success callback
[00:14:35] <shoky> tho actually no idea how .hide/.fadeIn works on <tbody> so nvm
[00:14:49] <Abhijit> ok
[00:15:01] <jtm> So so far I got it down even more simplified and still erroring
[00:15:04] <jtm> I'll work on it a bit more :)
[00:16:22] <jtm> I think doing: var $rows = $(data); then passing $rows into append is breaking it.
[00:17:06] <jtm> Actually no...
[00:18:23] <ak5> hi guys, how do I disable all events associated with my object
[00:18:32] <ak5> there is a function, I forgot the name
[00:18:37] <ak5> method
[00:18:44] <shoky> ?off
[00:18:45] <bot-t> shoky, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[00:19:33] <ak5> no I have to remove all of them, not specific ones
[00:19:47] <ak5> also, built in ones on input fields for example
[00:20:04] <jtm> ok so doing fadeIn on the $(data) is breaking it.
[00:20:10] <jtm> If I do .show() it works fine.
[00:21:06] <jtm> http://pastebin.com/vLiuJxNw
[00:21:35] <jtm> So it has to do with .fadeIn
[00:21:49] <Abhijit> ravenzz, i changed it to on succes http://paste.ubuntu.com/1420542/ but it still not work
[00:21:55] <jtm> maybe fadein? :)
[00:22:18] <jtm> nope
[00:22:30] <ak5> I have a textarea field, and all I want users to do is add linebreaks and remove them - how do I do this?
[00:23:58] <jtm> So the problem is, IE is having a difficult time fading in this data.
[00:27:53] <shoky> ak5:  $(...).off()  removes all jquery event handlers
[00:28:56] <shoky> jtm: is this really tabular data, btw?
[00:29:00] <jtm> shoky Maybe someone can't fadeIn <tr><td></td></tr> data?
[00:29:01] <jtm> Yes
[00:29:13] <shoky> jtm:  obviously you can because the fiddle works.
[00:29:30] <shoky> jtm: if your html is only 10x bigger than what you posted.. just post the whole thing
[00:29:38] <shoky> so we can run the same code..
[00:29:41] <jtm> I made one bigger in jsfiddler
[00:29:43] <shoky> o
[00:29:51] <jtm> Still worked fine
[00:29:58] <jtm> So I'm just baffled at this point
[00:30:07] <shoky> try using the IE9 debugger :\
[00:30:10] <jtm> All the tags are closed
[00:30:41] <jtm> Each row is wrapped with an appropriate <tr></tr>
[00:30:48] <jtm> each column with an appropriate <td></td>
[00:30:55] <shoky> can you paste the whole ajax success callback..
[00:31:04] <shoky> and the ajax request too actually
[00:31:20] <Abhijit> how can i get data of one ajax call and pass it to another ajax call?
[00:32:10] <shoky> Abhijit: in the callback of the first one, make the second one
[00:34:55] <jtm> shoky http://pastebin.com/hcDKjZE1
[00:36:39] <shoky> jtm: heh i meant the code
[00:36:57] <jtm> oh lol
[00:37:39] <Abhijit> shoky, ok
[00:37:58] <jtm> shoky http://pastebin.com/xAnk6P4E
[00:38:31] <jtm> If you change $rows.show() to $rows.fadeIn('slow')
[00:38:35] <jtm> it breaks
[00:38:46] <jtm> Even $rows.fadeOut('slow') breaks it.
[00:44:27] <shoky> jtm heh
[00:44:28] <jtm> shoky To make it more strange, it does actually append 1 row.
[00:44:33] <shoky> managed to reproduce it in a fiddle
[00:44:37] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/p5DSb/17/
[00:44:38] <jtm> Really?
[00:44:58] <shoky> took your html with all the newlines from the ajax request
[00:45:07] <shoky> and put it in some hidden element
[00:45:19] <shoky> then i took that element's html() as the html to append/fadein
[00:45:59] <jtm> So is this a bug? :)
[00:47:05] <jtm> Looks like it breaks on initial Click me, but not after. For me, I get 1 row appended, then it breaks, and then it never attempts to do anything new.
[00:47:15] <jtm> On my site
[00:47:47] <jtm> Actually it does only append 1
[00:47:49] <jtm> in your case.
[00:48:15] <shoky> if you remove the whitespace between the first </tr> and the second <tr>
[00:48:21] <shoky> then you'll se it append 2 ;P
[00:48:29] <shoky> IE is not liking all that whitespace
[00:48:36] <shoky> and doing .fadeIn on it
[00:48:37] <shoky> probably :P
[00:48:43] <shoky> or some other lame IE crap
[00:48:47] <jtm> lol
[00:49:03] <shoky> (whitespace is text which is considered a text node)
[00:49:14] <jtm> I do have it indented an extra 2 spaces per line
[00:49:15] <shoky> i think.
[00:49:23] <jtm> you mean the \r\n?
[00:49:29] <jtm> or "spaces"
[00:50:17] <jtm> Isn't it weird though that IE7 standards work?
[00:50:19] <jtm> For Document Mode
[00:50:21] <shoky> whitespace means  spaces and newlines and tabs
[00:50:49] <shoky> i rather not speculate as to whats weird or not in IE-land ;]
[00:51:06] <shoky> it's pointless :P
[00:51:31] <jtm> Blah, I swear I made the code neat...
[00:51:48] <shoky> the code is fine
[00:51:56] <shoky> IE is lame
[00:51:58] <jtm> Don't tell me I need to remove all the "spaces"
[00:52:05] <jtm> out of this template
[00:52:10] <jtm> It's going to look horrible
[00:52:14] <shoky> well, just between </tr> and <tr>  :\
[00:52:20] <jtm> I did
[00:52:24] <jtm> Let me clear history
[00:52:26] <jtm> err cache
[00:52:40] <jtm> I mean server cache that is
[00:52:57] <jtm> Naa, it's getting these new lines somewhere
[00:53:11] <shoky> shrugs
[00:53:11] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[00:53:22] <jtm> It's the shitty template system causing those spaces
[00:53:51] <shoky> hmpf
[00:54:58] <jtm> Still can't fix it on my end, but I guess I'll figure it out eventually
[00:55:30] <jtm> shoky You think it's possible because this html was done under Apple?
[00:55:38] <jtm> So all the new line spaces are a different character
[01:00:55] <shoky> jtm: no
[01:01:17] <shoky> here's a reduced testcase: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/p5DSb/20/
[01:04:24] <jtm> shoky What is the solution though?
[01:04:45] <jtm> I removed everything even everything between <tr> and </tr> where it was just <tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr>
[01:04:45] <shoky> even more reduced: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/p5DSb/22/
[01:06:14] <shoky> doesnt matter even if its a table
[01:06:41] <jtm> ok fixed it
[01:06:42] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/p5DSb/23/
[01:07:18] <jtm> Here's the solution: http://pastebin.com/4LjyNsj6
[01:07:27] <jtm> Now the code looks bad
[01:08:19] <jtm> I hate IE
[01:08:20] <jtm> :)
[01:08:30] <jtm> Thank you shoky!
[01:09:52] <shoky> ;]
[01:18:30] <Olive6767> Hi there :)
[01:20:02] <Olive6767> Quick question: is $('input[type=text]').attr('value')='foo' the same as $('input[type=text]').val('foo') ?
[01:20:21] <abjorn> you can't do .attr("value") = "foo";
[01:20:25] <abjorn> need to do either
[01:20:34] <abjorn> .attr("value", "foo"); or .val("foo");
[01:21:02] <Olive6767> abkorn: ok thx :)
[01:21:09] <Olive6767> abjorn
[01:21:19] <abjorn> np
[01:24:18] <ak5> $(document).on('keypress', function (e) {console.log(e + ' ' + e.which);}); this seems to work fine for me but it is not reporting the arrow keys?
[01:25:11] <shoky> ak5: use keydown or keyup
[01:26:01] <ak5> shoky: thanks
[01:29:59] <csm>  
[01:32:57] <Abhijit> i have two js.jq code in two diff files. how can i make them read same array and push to same array
[01:37:45] <csm> are you running them in the same document context?
[01:39:12] <csm> ie., on the same webpage?
[01:44:11] <Abhijit> how can i make <div> persist all the text added to it?
[01:44:33] <abjorn> append to it rather than replacing it's contents
[01:44:38] <Abhijit> i am appending
[01:44:44] <Abhijit> but on page refresh it lost its content
[01:45:05] <abjorn> oh, then you need to store it somewhere and load it back up on page load
[01:45:16] <Abhijit> abjorn, i am doing this jQuery("#output").prepend(
[01:46:57] <Abhijit> abjorn, i am doing push to add it to grlobal array but that do not reflect into div
[01:47:30] <Whirl3d> good morning #jquery
[01:47:46] <abjorn> abhijit, that's not going to persist it
[01:48:05] <abjorn> you need to store it in local storage or on the server or something
[01:48:13] <Abhijit> i see
[01:52:36] <shoky> morning Whirl3d

[02:16:54] <beachandbytes> how can i get this to work with multiple items
[02:18:49] <beachandbytes> i ended up just building the query string with strings
[02:18:51] <beachandbytes> but thats so hacky
[02:18:57] <anew> anyone using require and/or backbone ?
[02:22:13] <ejo> backbone here, haven't gotten into require yet
[02:26:50] <shoky> ircnode0: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DWLpV/1/
[02:27:03] <shoky> put callback=?
[02:27:13] <shoky> and dont use data.length  because data is an object, not an array
[02:30:37] <anew> ejo for backbone know any good tuts ?
[02:31:17] <shoky> ircnode0: er sorry didnt notice ravenzz's fiddle
[02:31:37] <shoky> nevermind me.
[02:33:37] <ejo> anew: also channel #documentcloud for backbone and related stuff
[02:33:53] <ejo> anew: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-1/  all parts of this were good, it's incremental and well done
[02:37:38] <ejo> also worth a peek at http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/

[02:42:17] <ircnode0> teacher note: For example, request to http://www.cs.hut.fi/u/vkaravir/countrydata/data/eu.json?callback=foo would result in file content like: foo({"va": "Vatican City", "ch": "Switzerland"});
[02:42:33] <shoky> yes, that's how JSONP works
[02:42:46] <anew> sorry was in bathroom... cool thanks ejo will check all that out
[02:50:10] <ak5> Hi I want to add a span to each element in my #orig: $('#orig').text().split(' ').each(function(){ $this.replace(/(.*)/, '<span>$1</span>');
[02:50:15] <ak5> });
[02:52:06] <ak5> a nvm got it

[02:56:05] <ircnode0> shoky: I mean why put callback=? instead of callback=foo?. Both works
[02:56:12] <ircnode0> ?
[02:56:41] <shoky> ircnode0:  putting callback=foo  didn't seem to make jquery treat it as a JSONP request
[02:57:02] <shoky> jquery makes its own callback
[02:57:12] <shoky> and injects the name into the ?
[02:59:07] <ircnode0> shoky: thanks, understood.
[03:03:23] <sheilablackrose> <beachandbytes>  thank you!
[03:21:50] <stardog818> Is there any kind of an event listener that will detect if a checbox changes to checked/unchecked by not being clicked on
[03:22:15] <stardog818> For example, I have a set of checkboxes, and then one "master" box that will check/uncheck all of them if you click on it
[03:22:46] <stardog818> Is there an event listener I can attach to the individual checkboxes that will fire off when they change as a result of being checked/unchecked by the master checkbox?
[03:23:05] <stardog818> I've tried $('.className').checked(function...)
[03:23:10] <stardog818> but it doesn't seem to be working
[03:23:19] <stardog818> I mean .change(function)
[04:04:27] <Abhijit> hi. i am calling jquery(button).click event. how can i trigger this event when user clicks on a specific button only and not on all buttons?
[04:07:13] <Cronoh> you should apply a class or id on the button and use it in your jquery selector
[04:07:40] <Abhijit> ok
[04:07:51] <Abhijit> Cronoh, but what is the syntax?
[04:08:39] <Cronoh> $(document).on('click', 'a#my_link_id', function(event) { // do stuff });
[04:09:06] <Cronoh> <a id="my_link_id">click me!</a>
[04:09:39] <Abhijit> ok
[04:16:06] <amon293> hi
[04:17:49] <amon293>  i want to redirect PT browsers to the PT page and other languages to EN page
[04:17:54] <amon293> at this point, i have this: if( (langPage={pt:"index-pt"}[ (navigator.language||navigator.userLanguage).substring(0,2) ]) )  location.replace(langPage+".html");
[05:09:18] <crab> if i have a string of arbitrary HTML (script tags, style tags, some divs), what's the best way to append everything in it to the DOM?
[05:10:19] <crab> oh, .append can take a string. well, then.
[05:14:44] <davetarmac> hi guys
[05:18:29] <davetarmac> Is there a nice way to slideToggle a group of divs in a certain way depending on the link clicked on?
[05:19:49] <davetarmac> for instance, when the page is loaded, all the content is hidden on this one page site, bat the home page content. When About is clicked, the home page slides up and the about slides down
[05:20:21] <davetarmac> if another page is clicked, then the active ones slide up, and the nominated page content slides down
[05:20:28] <davetarmac> I hope that makes sense :)
[05:21:21] <ak5> how do I get the full (inner and outer) html of each object in my jquery object into an array?
[05:22:27] <ak5> I have $('#myId').children.each(function(){myArray.push(this)});
[05:23:50] <davetarmac> I'm trying to find an example of what I'm trying to achieve, but all I can find is eased scrolling down a page
[05:24:39] <shoky> ak5:  myJqueryObj.map(function(i, elem){ return $('<div>').append( $(elem).clone() ).html() }).get()
[05:25:04] <shoky> myJqueryObj can be $('#myId').children()
[05:25:16] <davetarmac> I think this is the nearest I can find: http://www.appeartome.com
[05:25:34] <davetarmac> but the jQuery on there seems a bit long-winded
[05:25:38] <davetarmac> is that the only way?
[05:28:07] <ak5> shoky: thanks again
[05:28:49] <ak5> shoky: why $('<div>').append
[05:29:03] <shoky> ak5:  because .html() gets the inner html
[05:29:12] <shoky> ak5: so i get the inner html of a containing <div>
[05:29:29] <shoky> ak5: its a known trick, used inside jquery itself also
[05:29:44] <ak5> I see
[05:29:53] <ak5> and <div> goes UP a step in the DOM?
[05:30:04] <shoky> <div> is just an element
[05:30:17] <shoky> if i append to the <div> , then whatever i append is inside the <div>
[05:30:25] <shoky> so the <div> will be one step up from what i append.. sure
[05:30:40] <ak5> I see, but I never throw that div into the dom
[05:30:46] <shoky> nope, no need to
[05:31:21] <ak5> ok thanks
[05:31:23] <ak5> no I get it
[05:31:30] <ak5> now*
[05:31:48] <shoky> goody
[05:32:05] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Good morning Shoky! Has anybody had any experience with a QR reader app that has a jquery interface?
[05:36:59] <davetarmac> Is there a way to find a div with a class, then change that class?
[05:37:34] <davetarmac> for instance, I want to find divs with class 'shown' and change them to 'hidden'
[05:38:18] <davetarmac> hmm - might have found it
[05:40:38] <ak5> shoky: there has got to be a good way to do something like this. I have html in an array, then I want to to something like myarray[n] = $(myarray[n]).addClass('foo')
[05:41:23] <davetarmac> OK, didn't work :(
[05:41:44] <shoky> ak5: dont understand what you want
[05:42:54] <ak5> shoky: I have an array like so: ['<span>foo<span>', '<span>bar<span>']. Now I want to add class='hide' to myArray[0]
[05:43:24] <ak5> I could do it with regex and such, but I feel there should be a jQuery way to do this
[05:45:08] <shoky> ak5: var newarray = $.map(array, function(el){ return $('<div>').append( $(el).addClass('hide') ).html() })
[05:45:52] <shoky> or just array = $.map(array, ...
[05:45:56] <shoky> to replace array ;p
[05:46:39] <shoky> keep in mind.. jquery is mainly for DOM manipulation.. not HTML parsing/manipulation
[05:50:43] <ak5> shoky: I see, this adds my class to all elements, not a specific one, though
[05:50:57] <ak5> I need to do if, else?
[05:51:04] <shoky> ok thought thats what you wanted
[05:51:37] <shoky> array[0] = $('<div>').append( $(array[0]).addClass('hide') ).html()
[05:51:37] <shoky> :\
[05:51:53] <Sgeo|web> At even the mere mention of jQuery ##javascript tells me to go here, even though I think my problem is a Javascript syntax issue
[05:51:54] <Sgeo|web> https://gist.github.com/61504cf2611b56fc9711
[05:52:03] <Sgeo|web> (realtime, fixed, and spectator are functions)
[05:52:11] <Sgeo|web> I'm getting unexpected token ,
[05:52:40] <shoky> Sgeo|web: that's an odd way of choosing which fuinction to call ;]
[05:52:55] <shoky> at least, odd for javascript
[05:53:01] <Sgeo|web> More elegant than a bunch of if statements, not as clinically insane as eval
[05:53:16] <shoky> yes, i didn't say it's bad
[05:53:26] <shoky> just.. don't see much of that in js ;]
[05:53:30] <Sgeo|web> What is bad is all the globals I'm using everywhere :(
[05:53:38] <shoky> ;[
[05:53:47] <Sgeo|web> I'm not much of a JS programmer. I'm quite comfortable with Haskell, current preferred language is Clojure
[05:54:23] <shoky> yep seen you wishing clojure was more like haskell on #clojure  :P
[05:54:40] <shoky> if i'm not mistaken
[05:54:54] <Sgeo|web> lol
[05:55:02] <Sgeo|web> That would probably be me, yes
[05:55:31] <Sgeo|web> Anyway, why am I getting a syntax error
[05:57:59] <shoky> put parentheses around the object literal
[05:58:07] <shoky> ({ ... })
[05:58:18] <Ancien> hi
[05:58:23] <Ancien> i have a problem
[05:59:15] <shoky> Sgeo|web: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/HewyM/
[05:59:23] <Ancien> i have to use data like : [["Jean","Taraud"]]
[05:59:31] <Ancien> and i don't know how can id
[05:59:34] <Ancien> *i
[06:00:13] <Sgeo|web> shoky: thank yoiu
[06:00:15] <Sgeo|web> *you
[06:00:42] <Ancien> can someone help me ?
[06:02:14] <ak5> shoky: thanks a lot
[06:02:51] <davetarmac> I know this can be made more efficient, I just don't know how to do it :( http://pastebin.com/97GJ4Xd2
[06:03:26] <davetarmac> Also the fact that some of it doesn't work, doesn't help :s
[06:03:34] <davetarmac> but it's a work in progress
[06:04:04] * davetarmac wonders if anyone looking at that jsut died a little inside
[06:04:40] <shoky> davetarmac: more than a little ;]
[06:05:09] <davetarmac> thought as much ;)
[06:05:38] <shoky> at least it's.. tidy :P
[06:05:47] <davetarmac> well that's something I guess
[06:06:49] <davetarmac> the big 2 problems I'm having is the bit that removed the 'active' class and I would like to use callbacks so that it closes any open divs before opening the new one
[06:09:28] <jquery> $('#div').click(function(){ addnewclass }  I want to restore previous class on click somewhere where is not #div, Maybe I need function $(target).onOutClick...
[06:11:24] <ak5> can I do notHasClass?
[06:12:02] <shoky> ?not
[06:12:02] <b-ot> shoky, not the opposite of .is()
[06:12:37] <shoky> ak5: there's .not()  there's :not(..) selector.  there's !bla.hasClass(...)
[06:12:41] <shoky> there's .is()
[06:12:50] <shoky> have your pick
[06:13:00] <davetarmac> ffs - what timing to have the connection drop!!!
[06:14:05] <davetarmac> is there a log for this channel so I can see what you actually said shoky?
[06:14:35] <shoky> davetarmac: i was talking to ak5 :P  but yes tehre's  http://irc.jquery.com
[06:14:48] <davetarmac> ah right that's OK then
[06:15:03] <davetarmac> I was just aware that I asked for assistance on these matters, then my connection dropped
[06:15:05] <Ancien> can someone help me ?
[06:15:26] <davetarmac> I get back on and you're talking away, wasn't sure if it was to me or not you see
[06:16:10] <shoky> davetarmac: its ok. anyway, be more specific and choose one problem at a time to focus on, and you'll prbably get more attention ;p
[06:16:30] <shoky> davetarmac: and a jsfiddle always helps
[06:17:17] <davetarmac> shoky: problem with the fiddle is that this is based on Drupal, so that might not be the easiest thing :(
[06:17:52] <shoky> try to reduce the fiddle to just the actual problem.. whatever's around it is irrelevant
[06:18:01] <davetarmac> ok
[06:22:24] <jquery> ?unclick
[06:22:26] <bot-t> jquery, .click() - Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:24:14] <davetarmac> shoky: here is the fiddle :) http://jsfiddle.net/MTkcn/1/
[06:32:03] <jquery> little help
[06:32:04] <jquery> http://jsfiddle.net/ZJUWm/
[06:36:54] <davetarmac> going to have to go now - the wife and kid are back. no more dev for me today!
[06:37:28] <shoky> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MTkcn/2/
[06:37:47] <shoky> i think that should do pretty much the same  ;p
[06:37:58] <shoky> except i fixed a bug or two in the process
[06:38:06] <davetarmac>  oh nice one, cheers
[06:38:13] <davetarmac> what did you fix?
[06:38:43] <davetarmac> all of it I see ;)
[06:38:45] <shoky> mm  you had some  if ( $('blabla').find('.active') ) { ... }
[06:38:50] <shoky> which doesn't make sense
[06:38:59] <shoky> (cause find will always return a truthy value)
[06:39:09] <davetarmac> ah right
[06:39:23] <shoky> and yeah, pretty much all of it :P
[06:39:46] <shoky> and if you can touch the html, it can be made even more succinct than i did
[06:39:54] <davetarmac> shoky: that if was basically if the clicked menu was already active then do nothing
[06:40:03] <shoky> ah
[06:40:21] <davetarmac> just so it didnt close then reopen
[06:40:59] <davetarmac> is there a find type thing that returns a true/false?
[06:41:06] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MTkcn/3/
[06:41:12] <shoky> there's  .is  and .hasClass
[06:41:24] <shoky> but you need to check $(this)
[06:41:31] <shoky> not whatever you had before
[06:41:40] <shoky> if (jQuery('#main-menu li a').find('.active'))
[06:41:48] <shoky> that checks all the <a>'s
[06:41:52] <davetarmac> ah right - i see what you did there
[06:42:37] <davetarmac> i'll have a proper look in a bit when i'm not balencing the laptop on one hand and fending a child off on the other
[06:42:53] <davetarmac> oh my kingdom for a house with an office!
[06:43:02] <shoky> heh
[06:43:30] <davetarmac> thanks for the massive assist shoky
[06:43:46] <shoky> np
[06:43:51] <davetarmac> I'll take a stab at sorting the active menu bit out either tonight or tomorrow
[07:18:02] <nerdsex> Guys, I've been struggling since last night. =(
[07:18:19] <nerdsex> How do i add a string i get via $.get to the current jquery set of elements
[07:18:25] <nerdsex> it's not .add()
[07:23:43] <ak5> how can I add my array.join(' ') to <input value="old_value1 olde_value2 myArray[0] myArray[n]"> ?
[07:27:51] <nook> hi, i have a little problem. I build a Div-Container with the attributs .draggable and .resizable. If the user opens the Webseit my PHP Code generat a DIV includes DIVS for each Element that shoud be displayd in the main div (that that is resizable).
[07:27:51] <nook> But the PHP Code dont know the height of the div. So JavaScript calculates the hight of the main div, and displays the number of div Elements form the hidden div "array" but if i use .append() the elements from the hidden div "array" get lost and are in the main div knwo
[07:28:16] <nook> but i want to append my main div with a coppy of the div element form the "array" and to delete or remove the element from that list
[07:31:18] <nook> does anyone understand my problem? ^ ^
[08:42:07] <CashewGuy> If I want to take the contents of two jquery variables, and merge them ( as in, $r = ro and $o = ot, and $r.add($o) = root), can I do that with .add?
[09:16:01] <ak5> shoky: btw, the \n char breaks your code from earlier: $($('#id').html().split(' ')).each(function(){array.push(this)});

[10:20:47] <aqeel> rabbi1:  remove() and then append()
[10:21:22] <aqeel> ! remove()
[10:21:30] <aqeel> ?remove()
[10:21:32] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/

[10:22:39] <aqeel> see your logic and apply accordingly
[10:22:51] <aqeel> what is it that you are doing
[10:22:58] <rabbi1> aqeel: its remove from <ul class='one'> and append to <ul class="two"> ...
[10:23:16] <awc7373> can jQuery listen to other functions?
[10:23:48] <aqeel> remove("classname"), append("classname") shouls do it
[10:23:48] <rabbi1> so $(.one li).remove(x); $(.two li).append(x);
[10:23:56] <aqeel> yes
[10:24:48] <aqeel> becareful of your punctuations..
[10:25:29] <aqeel>  $(".one li").remove(x); $(".two li").append(x);...x being element in ""
[10:27:02] <aqeel> remove will toatally remove and not make it unavailable...
[10:27:26] <rabbi1> yes, x is a element of li i.e, li,html
[10:27:32] <rabbi1> yes, x is a element of li i.e, li.html
[10:29:35] <rabbi1> aqeel: remove before append doesn't work and remove after append is only appending but not removing ....

[12:00:53] <imsky> not enjoying this gray ass weather
[12:00:59] <abjorn> i herd dat
[12:01:13] <abjorn> I just got done with LANFest. Was fun.
[12:01:21] <imsky> what did you play
[12:01:21] <abjorn> Unfortunately I didn't win any swag in the raffle :(
[12:01:44] <abjorn> TF2, LoL, Warsow
[12:01:54] <abjorn> saints row
[12:01:59] <imsky> oh fo sho, didnt know anybody played warsow
[12:02:06] <abjorn> yeah it's real popular at lanfest
[12:02:26] <imsky> i've set up couchdb for the first time this week
[12:02:36] <imsky> seems like a legit thing
[12:02:42] <abjorn> werddd
[12:02:50] <imsky> not really a fan of the map reduce
[12:03:04] <abjorn> me either
[12:03:20] <imsky> what's up at the gator
[12:03:22] <abjorn> I prefer querying a bit more like mongo or something
[12:03:25] <abjorn> not a lot
[12:03:37] <imsky> you going to hang on to the job a lil while longer?
[12:04:06] <abjorn> yeah it's going fine lately so it's whatever
[12:04:10] <abjorn> after all that crap blew over
[12:04:39] <imsky> sounds good brah
[12:05:51] <wathek> is there a way to intercept the resize event when it's fired on body tag or on the div ?
[12:06:06] <imsky> ooh
[12:06:09] <imsky> interceptor.js
[12:06:15] <imsky> quick abjorn
[12:06:19] <imsky> to the github new repo screen!
[12:06:52] <abjorn> you could
[12:06:53] <abjorn> oh
[12:06:54] <abjorn> I don't know
[12:06:58] <abjorn> attach an event handler?
[12:07:19] <imsky> seems weak bro
[12:07:22] <abjorn> that came out more sarcastic than I intended
[12:07:23] <wathek> abjorn, I'd like to resize one div when the body tag or div#main has been resized
[12:07:29] <imsky> on a related note lol at javascript frameworks
[12:07:46] <imsky> it's either WIDGET LIBRARY WITH ITS OWN QUERY ENGINE or BACKBONE.JS WITH UUIDs
[12:08:01] <abjorn> so then $("body,div#main").resize(function (e) { /* resize some div */ });
[12:08:36] <imsky> yeah that's..not going to work
[12:08:55] <abjorn> i dont fuck with resize event but Y NAWT
[12:08:59] <imsky> lol at u
[12:09:14] <wathek> imsky, yes it won't work
[12:09:14] <ajpiano> because there isn't a native resize event on things that aren't the window
[12:09:17] <ajpiano> however there is a plugin
[12:09:22] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman jquery resize plugin
[12:09:23] <bot-t> ajpiano, Ben Alman » jQuery resize event - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[12:09:32] <abjorn> fair nuff
[12:09:57] <imsky> but does cowboy debounce his constant polling
[12:10:02] <imsky> and there's a sentence you'll never see again
[12:10:24] <ajpiano> yea it's like, if you are the one putting the content into the div that causes it to resize elsewhere in your app
[12:10:35] <ajpiano> polling for resize events isn't exactly the "right place" to hook into that happening
[12:11:29] <imsky> lol NB: "While this plugin works in jQuery 1.3.2, if an elementâ€™s event callbacks are manually triggered via .trigger( 'resize' ) or .resize() those callbacks may double-fire, due to limitations in the jQuery 1.3.2 special events system."

[12:13:22] <imsky> i havent found penny arcade or vidya humor funny ever
[12:13:31] <abjorn> you are dead inside
[12:13:36] <imsky> :(
[12:13:39] <imsky> but i feel so
[12:13:40] <imsky> alive
[12:13:46] <abjorn> but on the inside
[12:13:48] <abjorn> your heart

[12:14:45] <imsky> this thing? http://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/i-wpxcK7J/0/L/i-wpxcK7J-X3.jpg
[12:15:19] <abjorn> yeah sometimes they do series strips that aren't necessarily intended to be funny
[12:15:28] <abjorn> I guess they get bored
[12:15:31] <imsky> seems like im missing the INSIDE JOKE THAT MAKES THIS HILARIOUS
[12:15:39] <abjorn> It's not supposed to be
[12:16:08] <imsky> yeaaa
[12:16:17] <imsky> when you get a lil older lil abjorn
[12:16:25] <imsky> you'll see these comics as pretty low effort
[12:16:35] <abjorn> not really ._.
[12:16:36] <wathek> ajpiano, I'm having problem with the jquery-resize-plug I'm getting this Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'w' of undefined
[12:16:46] <imsky> abjorn: lol you say that now
[12:16:46] <wathek> on the line 198 of that lib
[12:17:29] <ajpiano> perhaps it doesn't work with more recent versions of jquery
[12:19:49] <rindolf> OK, I think I'll post my question on stackoverflow.com - will give a link here.
[12:19:51] <wathek> ajpiano, yay it works ! I found a fix here https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-resize/issues/1
[12:19:52] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1 on jquery-resize (fluxsaas; 1y, 10m ago): Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'w' of undefined
[12:22:35] <NielsNL> please help me to get this issue working with the jquery-ui tabs: http://jsfiddle.net/WTkfy/
[12:23:47] <NielsNL> I need to have an event fired when people switch tabs but it does not work.
[12:25:57] <ravenzz> NielsNL you should read the documentation :)
[12:26:15] <NielsNL> i did but somehow i'm missing something
[12:32:40] <ravenzz> NielsNL http://jsfiddle.net/UWU55/
[12:33:44] <NielsNL> thanks, somehow there it works fine.
[12:34:09] <NielsNL> But not one my site: http://demo.fusionticket.org/index.php?event_id=3&action=buy

[12:42:09] <JBlitzen> Thanks, heh
[12:43:04] <TKoL> i have a problem that you guys would probably think is quite simple, but for me it's a bit over my head:
[12:43:25] <TKoL> i don't know any javascript/jquery, and my client has asked me to make a javascript carousel
[12:43:49] <TKoL> like this one: http://wiki.hashweb.org/view/Jquerycarousel
[12:43:59] <nickmessing> Hello, I have a question
[12:44:07] <TKoL> but i can't get it to work
[12:44:24] <TKoL> idk what's going wrong
[12:45:24] <nickmessing> i have something like: for(i=0;i<a.length;i++) $.ajax({...., error:function(){alert(i)}}); is there any way to make "i" work there?
[12:45:37] <JBlitzen> Have you tried reducing your code to the simplest port of that example code, TKoL, and then adding your other code back in slowly until it breaks?
[12:45:51] <TKoL> @Jblitzen no i haven't
[12:45:54] <TKoL> that's a good idea
[12:46:04] <JBlitzen> nod, just a thought from a programmer who doesn't do much in jquery
[12:46:59] <rindolf> rabbi1: still there?
[12:48:27] <JBlitzen> Sorry, nickmessing, I dunno
[12:48:41] <JBlitzen> And I didn't see your question but I probably don't know about it either, rindolf
[12:49:17] <rindolf> JBlitzen: OK.
[12:50:37] <TKoL> jblitzen i tried that and it actually broke in it's simplest form
[12:50:45] <TKoL> which is strange because it's working fine in the example
[12:52:22] <nickmessing> TKoL, can you paste your code to jsfiddle and send it to me?
[12:52:25] <JBlitzen> TKoL, that seems, BS
[12:52:35] <TKoL> jblitzen i agree
[12:52:37] <TKoL> seems bs
[12:52:40] <JBlitzen> Like your simplest form is still using other js includes on your side or something
[12:52:48] <JBlitzen> Your simplest form should BE the example
[12:52:52] <TKoL> yes
[12:52:54] <TKoL> that's what i mean
[12:54:01] <JBlitzen> Post it
[12:54:03] <TKoL> nickmessing http://94.23.61.75/whmcs/templates/test/test.html
[12:54:03] <anew> shit what was the backbone channel again i forgot to save it
[12:54:24] <TKoL> not jsfiddle, hopefully this is better
[12:57:55] <TKoL> i am trying to keep it to it's bare bones here jblitzen, as you can see, but for some reason it's not working for me
[12:58:04] <TKoL> i used the exact same css, javascript and html as the source
[12:58:32] <TKoL> i thought anyway...
[12:58:36] <TKoL> what am i getting wrong here?
[12:58:55] <rabbi1> rindolf: i have found an alternate solution, but just trying to get it 100%
[12:58:57] <JBlitzen> Yeah, scoping
[12:59:40] <nickmessing> TKoL, parentWidth is null, why?
[12:59:50] <TKoL> what do you mean?
[12:59:52] <TKoL> is that in the css?
[13:00:56] <nickmessing> no
[13:01:12] <TKoL> sry i don't understand what you mean
[13:01:17] <nickmessing> TKoL, I know what's the problem :D
[13:01:26] <TKoL> :D
[13:01:39] <TKoL> what is it nickmessing ?
[13:01:49] <nickmessing> wait, i will send jsfiddle link
[13:01:55] <TKoL> ok
[13:02:19] <Logikos> this question is not specific to just jquery but odds are its something simple and most in here could explain it..
[13:02:19] <Logikos> I tryed to minimize alot of code to show a simple reproduction of an unexpected behaviour i am experienceing in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/93hdT/  ... if you look at the console you will notice that in cbfunction if i set or change this.curIndex it changes the value of test.curIndex ... and i dont understand why?
[13:05:03] <rindolf> rabbi1: OK, so do you still need help?
[13:05:40] <nickmessing> TKoL, http://jsfiddle.net/gXj3L/
[13:06:05] <nickmessing> just added $(document).ready(function(){}); and defined all global variables before it :D
[13:07:21] <JBlitzen> Yeah, was trying the same thing but only now do I realize it was failing because I'd left the ".js" out of the jquery include
[13:07:24] <JBlitzen> lol
[13:09:12] <JBlitzen> Logikos, that only has the javascript code, not the HTML
[13:09:15] <TKoL> oh thank you nickmessing
[13:09:37] <nickmessing> TKoL, that works for you?
[13:09:41] <JBlitzen> Or whatever you would use to test it
[13:09:49] <Logikos> JBlitzen: its only a javascript question
[13:10:09] <JBlitzen> Be nice to be able to test it
[13:10:15] <TKoL> is that something that has to be added at the beginning of any javascript?
[13:10:20] <TKoL> nickmessing, yes
[13:10:54] <rabbi1> rindolf: nope, that's alright. :)
[13:10:58] <JBlitzen> Though I guess I have no idea what's going on and can't help, Logikos, since I don't know what main is in that context
[13:11:10] <nickmessing> TKoL, $(document).ready(function(){ ...your jQuery code ... });
[13:11:13] <rindolf> rabbi1: OK. :-)
[13:11:26] <nickmessing> this means that your code will be executed after HTML loads
[13:11:29] <rindolf> rabbi1: Happy Hanukkah, BTW. (Don't know if you're Jewish).
[13:12:03] <Logikos> JBlitzen: its ok, the folks in #javascript have now responded, but just so you know, the output is in console .. there was no need for html for this problem
[13:12:06] <Logikos> brb
[13:12:58] <JBlitzen> I'm sure you're right, I'm just curious what main is in that context
[13:13:09] <JBlitzen> Or how you can run that code and have it do anything
[13:13:58] <rabbi1> rindolf: i am not
[13:14:10] <rabbi1> thanks and wish you the same.
[13:14:41] <rindolf> rabbi1: thanks.
[13:14:54] <Logikos> supose within the test function i applied click events to some element, within the function to define the events the 'this' keyword will refer to that element i'm applying the event to, but supose from within that function i need to reference a property from the main object ... so i set main = this so i can refer to the main object as main rather than 'this'
[13:15:04] <TKoL> i'm always sorta floored by hte helpfulness of people on IRC, thank you nickmessing
[13:15:41] <Logikos> the example i put in jsfiddle is cut up and has tones of junk striped out of it just so the problem can be clearly show without a bunch of other code that does not partain to my question ... the code left in there is not ment to be useful on its own
[13:16:55] <JBlitzen> k, thought I was missing some fundamental keywords
[13:17:01] <JBlitzen> Did #javascript answer your question
[13:17:28] <Logikos> they tried, now they are argueign with eachother over details, and i'm reading up on stuff
[13:17:38] <Logikos> i'm still somewhat confused but getting better
[13:17:51] <Logikos> we'll see how well i can understand this link i'm reading lol
[13:17:54] <JBlitzen> It would help to have a test example
[13:18:05] <Logikos> that is what the jsfiddle was
[13:18:18] <JBlitzen> No, that's just an example, I would have to add shit to it to test it
[13:18:36] <Logikos> my question is why the 'this' keyword in the cbfunction seems to refer back to the test object
[13:19:07] <JBlitzen> I saw your question
[13:19:10] <Logikos> it runs, and outputs in console ... perhaps i'm not explaining myself well enough
[13:19:21] <Logikos> either way, i'll re-add if i dont get it after reading this document
[13:19:24] <Logikos> thanks
[13:19:26] <JBlitzen> k
[13:19:37] <Logikos> re-add was suposed to be re-ask
[13:20:31] <JBlitzen> (I don't think the jsfiddle example runs, as there's nothing to actually trigger the test function)
[13:21:13] <Logikos> the very first line instatiates test
[13:21:23] <Logikos> did you open console to see the output?
[13:22:48] <JBlitzen> No, I read it as setting ss_ctrl to point to the function, which I now assume was totally wrong, heh
[13:24:34] <JBlitzen> Ah, gotcha now
[13:29:06] <Logikos> maybe i'm doing it all wrong, i just started fooling with javascript last year and the only OOP experience i have is in php ... although i'm not a total novis anymore, there is ALOT of javascript i have yet to grasp lol
[13:30:01] <JBlitzen> Are you using the bind keyword anywhere, Logikos?
[13:30:07] <Logikos> i get and love json arrays .. or objects, whatever  .. but still get confused how classes work in javascript ... and how you can just append function names to junk .. like blah.somefunction()
[13:30:14] <Logikos> JBlitzen: no
[13:30:30] <JBlitzen> A quick perusal of bing shows some stackoverflow posts suggesting the use of the bind function to unfuck "this" keyword confusion with callback functions
[13:30:45] <JBlitzen> I searched "javascript callback 'this keyword'"
[13:31:16] <Logikos> beyond simply fixing my little problem, i want to truly understand what is going on
[13:31:33] <Logikos> if the 'this' keyword within cbfunction still references the original object
[13:31:44] <Logikos> then i dont need to pass a reference to the original object when i call the function
[13:31:58] <JBlitzen> No wait, that's ECMAScript?
[13:32:06] <JBlitzen> nod
[13:32:15] <JBlitzen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701987/javascript-function-binding-this-keyword-is-lost-after-assignment
[13:32:17] <JBlitzen> You see that one?
[13:32:23] <Logikos> isnt javascript just another way of saying ECMAscript
[13:32:24] <Logikos> ?
[13:32:29] <Logikos> i thought they were the same thing
[13:34:03] <JBlitzen> I dunno offhand
[13:34:12] <JBlitzen> I didn't peruse the link I saw that in very closely
[13:35:07] <JBlitzen> Ctrl-f in this page for ".bind": http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
[13:35:12] <JBlitzen> Note the period before bind
[13:36:24] <JBlitzen> http://www.robertsosinski.com/2009/04/28/binding-scope-in-javascript/
[13:36:25] <JBlitzen> One more
[13:36:41] <JBlitzen> That might be the best link for you I think, Logikos
[13:38:12] <wathek> can help me please I'm having a problem when changing the height of one element http://www-test.lacriee.com/nos-restaurants-la-criee when the window is resized the left bar is being resized too but when you click for example on Ile de France it doesn't resize the left bar however when I use console.log it shows the new height
[13:38:17] <wathek> any idea ?
[13:42:20] <TomWij> Interpunction helps us help you.
[13:56:33] <CFNinja> Is it possible to move or duplicate the button functions of .dialog() in the title bar? I know the X is there for closing the window. I'd like the ability to have the buttons at the bottom or images at the top with the same functionality.
[14:01:59] <CFNinja> ah. I bet putting a span with the appropriate UI icon  like <span class=\"ui-icon ui-icon-trash\" style=\"float:right;\"></span> well.. an anchor and linking it to the same function that the button fires will work.
[14:06:33] <Blubsi> Hi

[15:56:26] <coldhead> i don't have any questions lasha, i was just looking at the many questions above that got no response
[15:56:39] <lasha> ohhh, i see.
[15:56:43] <lasha> dang. lol
[15:57:44] <Blubsi> yep unanswered question level is over 9000
[15:58:07] <lasha> we shouldn't be wokring weekends, then, i guess. lol
[16:00:17] <lasha> so, what's everyone working on today?
[16:00:24] <Blubsi> http://jsfiddle.net/SESLH/1/
[16:00:26] <Blubsi> on this atm
[16:00:30] <Blubsi> want to help me?:D
[16:03:18] <lasha> damn! what is supposed to do? lol
[16:03:34] <Blubsi> it should be a timeline
[16:03:36] <Blubsi> like this one:
[16:03:36] <Blubsi> http://brand.joop.com/#/brand/
[16:03:43] <Blubsi> I'm not sure if you can see what I mean
[16:03:56] <Blubsi> it should be under "geschichte"/history
[16:04:58] <tiggorz> hi
[16:05:06] <lasha> ohhh, fancy!
[16:05:19] <Blubsi> well fancy and looked so simple
[16:05:28] <tiggorz> how can I set a timeout for the builtin tooltip of jquery UI. It just never disappears
[16:05:29] <tiggorz> ?
[16:05:38] <Blubsi> so I(as a total jquery noob) thought it would be easy
[16:05:42] <Blubsi> it wasn't/isnt
[16:06:13] <lasha> well, technically, it's not TOO hard to achieve something like that.
[16:06:24] <lasha> you just need proper counters and calculations
[16:06:33] <lasha> and i suck at math, soooo.
[16:07:30] <lasha> so you have a finite number of pictures
[16:07:39] <lasha> and a finite number of clickable dates
[16:07:46] <lasha> that match.
[16:07:52] <Guest17480> Hi all, would any one be able to help me on how I properly add a fadeTo to this: contentToShow.show(); ?
[16:08:17] <lasha> just do contentToShow.fadeTo(xxxx)
[16:08:24] <lasha> and should automatically take care of the display settings
[16:08:43] <lasha> so Blubsi, you take the total width of the gallery
[16:08:45] <lasha> with ALL the items in it
[16:08:55] <tiggorz> anyone? No tooltip-gods around?
[16:09:34] <Blubsi> yeah
[16:09:47] <lasha> and then for example if the width is 2000px
[16:09:48] <Blubsi> but my first problem is,if you see it,that the links are all on the right border
[16:09:54] <lasha> the math would go like....
[16:10:17] <Blubsi>         $('.marker').last().css('padding-left',$(this).attr('data-date')+'px');
[16:10:24] <lasha> (2000 / Number of Links) * (width of one gallery item)
[16:10:24] <Blubsi> I'm trying to replace the data-date
[16:10:29] <coldhead> not much gods of any kind at this hour
[16:10:41] <coldhead> no gods no masters, it's like the title of an anarchist anthology
[16:10:43] <Blubsi> with data-test
[16:10:57] <Blubsi> so that all links would be inside the orange bar
[16:11:04] <Blubsi> with a 50px padding
[16:11:31] <lasha> so do you want the scrolling effects and stuff?
[16:11:34] <lasha> or just content replacement?
[16:12:25] <Blubsi> yes
[16:12:30] <Blubsi> I also want the scrolling and stuff
[16:12:36] <Blubsi> but I think thats the second thing :D
[16:12:50] <Blubsi> or less important thing :D
[16:13:01] <lasha> in my opinion, you probably shouldn't be doing content replacement based on data-xxx values
[16:13:15] <lasha> just populate all of your divs/html whatever
[16:13:19] <lasha> and hide/show them accordingly
[16:13:24] <lasha> to save you logic.
[16:13:35] <Blubsi> could you show an exmaple of that?
[16:14:42] <lasha> ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
[16:14:49] <lasha> i think there's a tutorial or two somehwere
[16:14:50] <lasha> hang on
[16:15:23] <Blubsi> ok :)
[16:16:07] <lasha> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-create-a-slick-tabbed-content-area/
[16:16:19] <lasha> This shows you the normal javascript way, and then a jQuery solution.
[16:16:25] <lasha> It's a lot to read, but covers good concepts.
[16:16:39] <lasha> The article is also like 4 years old, but should apply to current version of jQuery.
[16:17:02] <Blubsi> Ok
[16:17:04] <Blubsi> thanks :)
[16:17:26] <lasha> Oh, this one looks A LOT simpler: http://www.entheosweb.com/tutorials/css/tabs.asp
[16:18:08] <Blubsi> and what would I have todo if I wanted to change the animation effect?
[16:18:16] <Blubsi> cuz I want to achieve the same one as joop has
[16:18:55] <lasha> did you try looking at their source code?
[16:19:10] <Blubsi> I'm looking at the second one atm
[16:19:52] <lasha> hmmm, maybe i should create a tutorial/plugin for that timeline stuff
[16:19:55] <lasha> would be REALLY cool.
[16:20:08] <lasha> but that wouldn't be anytime soon :-/
[16:20:10] <agsel> morning. I have a table which I want to be sortable. this part works fine $('table#blah tbody').sortable();
[16:20:10] <agsel> now, when I do some other stuff, I update my table via ajax. the whole table will be recreated (I will just replace html). I will still have table#blah. Now I want it to be again sortable, but it doesn't work. The element doesn't have sortable() method anymore. I suppose jqueryui thinks it's already sortable, but it's not. any suggestions?
[16:21:02] <lasha> agsel: you might want to retrigger the .sortable() function
[16:21:03] <_Blubsi> oh great internet
[16:21:20] <agsel> lasha: can you point me to retrigger stuff?
[16:21:47] <lasha> agsel: after you do the table modification, just do $('table#blah tbody').sortable(); again
[16:22:24] <agsel> lasha: it says "sortable is not a function" or something like that
[16:22:56] <agsel> If I tried $('#blah').sortable(); and $('#blah').sortable(); I guess I would get the same error
[16:23:12] <agsel> if something is already sortable, I cannot retrigger sortable
[16:23:32] <lasha> lemme check the UI docs
[16:24:34] <agsel> how can I use jqueryui in jsfiddle?
[16:24:38] <agsel> haven't tried that before
[16:25:34] <lasha> in the resources tab on the left
[16:25:39] <lasha> you can load in jqueryui JS file
[16:26:36] <agsel> URL?
[16:26:55] <agsel> or can I just use something like "juqyerui"?
[16:27:01] <agsel> jqueryui
[16:28:05] <coldhead> if you choose jQuery 1.6.2 on the menu at the left
[16:28:16] <coldhead> you get checkboxes to include jQuery UI
[16:28:28] <coldhead> not sure why you don't get them for later jQuery
[16:28:28] <lasha> WOOP!
[16:28:45] <w00tner> does anyone know how can i define a new canvas ??
[16:28:47] <coldhead> 1.7.2*
[16:28:48] <w00tner> var image = new fabric.Image.fromURL(uploadFile, function(image) {
[16:28:54] <w00tner> Uncaught ReferenceError: canvas is not defined
[16:29:07] <w00tner> im using fabric.js
[16:29:18] <tw2113> create a jsfiddle at least
[16:29:41] <tw2113> even if it isn't technically a jquery issue
[16:30:58] <w00tner> http://jsfiddle.net/JWkFs/1/
[16:31:23] <w00tner> im uploading an i storage the path in uploadFile variable. it works fine
[16:31:58] <lasha> w00tner: the fabric library has to be added to the "add resources" panel on the left
[16:32:07] <w00tner> but i want to drop that image into the canvas using fabric.js  using that code in the fiddie but im getting Uncaught ReferenceError: canvas is not defined
[16:32:17] <lasha> and then when you call your agregaImg function, it suould be able to create
[16:32:19] <hateIE> can (document).ready exist twice?
[16:32:20] <lasha> the object
[16:32:35] <w00tner> hateUI
[16:32:38] <tw2113> yes hateIE
[16:33:09] <coldhead> hateINTOLERANCE
[16:33:22] <w00tner> hateIE: i rather use  $(document).on("ready", function1());     $(document).on("ready", function2());
[16:33:35] <w00tner> and then create function function () {}   i think is better practice
[16:33:44] <w00tner> and you are not creating anonymous functions
[16:33:53] <w00tner> that rapes ur server in the ass with a drill
[16:34:09] <hateIE> lol
[16:34:25] <hateIE> ok thnx
[16:34:29] <w00tner> and it looks nicer
[16:35:10] <coldhead> surely $(document).on("ready", function1);
[16:35:15] <coldhead> without the ()
[16:35:25] <w00tner> oh yeah
[16:35:37] <w00tner> $(document).on("ready", initFunction);
[16:35:40] <w00tner> sorry :)
[16:36:06] <coldhead> carry on
[16:36:33] <w00tner> so who is going to help me
[16:37:01] <tw2113> get fabric.js loaded
[16:37:10] <w00tner> its loaded
[16:37:16] <w00tner> i just paste the part of the script
[16:37:35] <tw2113> in the jsfiddle
[16:37:37] <tw2113> get it loaded
[16:37:41] <tw2113> so the fiddle knows of the library
[16:40:12] <hugo_moss> hello, i have a function called initcallback(), i'm using jcarousel. the function returns from two cases, if the state is in reset mode, then return, otherwise register an on handler, reset the carousel, and then return false.  the problem is i want to turn the on handler off and allow the handler to do stuff, and then once completed turn it back on again.  the problem is, when i turn .on back
[16:40:12] <hugo_moss> on again, and then return false afterwards, the return false doesn't execute after .on is called immediately, instead it attaches the handler, and once the handler is executed again, then it returns from the previous false, and i have this kind of recursion thing going on, and i cant make sense of it
[16:41:25] <hugo_moss> can anyone help
[16:46:00] <coldhead> not from the description, no
[16:46:16] <coldhead> ?p @ hugo_moss
[16:46:17] <bot-t> hugo_moss, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:47:55] <agsel> I wanted to create my problem in jsfiddle, bu cannot reproduce it. I have a lot of code, which can create problems. so, does anyone know, why my "sortable()" function gets removed from the object?
[16:48:06] <agsel> $(object) doesn't have sortable()
[16:48:19] <agsel> what can cause that?
[16:48:23] <coldhead> are you loading jQuery twice?
[16:48:39] <coldhead> a 2nd load will wipe out all the plugins previously attached to the earlier jQuery
[16:48:40] <agsel> can this be a problem? I guess not
[16:48:57] <agsel> sortable() works for the first time
[16:49:13] <coldhead> there are only two ways i know of where sortable would be removed
[16:49:16] <agsel> technically sortable(); then some code; sortable() <- doesn't work any more
[16:49:23] <coldhead> delete $.fn.sortable; and loading jQuery twice
[16:50:03] <coldhead> at the point where sortable works, try saving a copy of jQuery
[16:50:08] <coldhead> var myQuery = jQuery;
[16:50:12] <coldhead> then use myQuery later
[16:50:16] <coldhead> and see if sortable works there
[16:50:17] <lasha> maybe the jquery object .sortable() is attached to was .remove()'d
[16:50:24] <coldhead> myQuery(foo).sortable();
[16:50:24] <lasha> or somehow unbinded
[16:51:45] <agsel> draggable and other ui stuff gets removed
[16:51:51] <agsel> I will try saving jquery
[16:53:07] <agsel> can this be a problem, that I will run my x.sortable() with eval()?
[16:53:21] <agsel> the second time
[16:53:45] <coldhead> yes
[16:54:19] <coldhead> why in gods name are you doing that
[16:54:26] <NLG> Yo, any1 have a tip?  how can I make resizable trigger droppable elements? I tried triggering some events but no luck and google has solutions for different problems :)
[16:55:35] <agsel> coldhead: long story. and I cannot completely avoid eval
[16:55:57] <agsel> ajax gives me html modifications. along with html modifications, I need to do some js stuff
[16:56:20] <agsel> so, ajax gives my html modifications and js modifications as string
[16:57:36] <agsel> I guess if I add a function into my original html, which does x.sortable() and just call out my function with eval, it should work
[16:57:37] <coldhead> maybe this might help http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[16:57:58] <coldhead> i'm not really au fait with working around eval(), i just avoid it entirelyt
[16:58:46] <wathek> can help me please I'm having a problem when changing the height of one element http://www-test.lacriee.com/nos-restaurants-la-criee when the window is resized the left bar is being resized too but when you click for example on Ile de France it doesn't resize the left bar however when I use console.log it shows the new height
[16:58:47] <wathek> any idea ?
[17:00:55] <coldhead> can you not use that new fangled "responsive" css and not have to bother with fiddling in JS?
[17:01:31] <wathek> coldhead, nope I'm rewriting the whole code because of that
[17:03:34] <coldhead> quick fixes, eh
[17:04:00] <coldhead> wathek: i'm not sure DOM elements have a resize event
[17:04:09] <coldhead> i thought you had to bind to $(window).resize()
[17:04:58] <wathek> coldhead, I'm using jquery.ba-resize.js to have the resize event on DOM elements
[17:05:08] <coldhead> oh neat, i love that thing
[17:05:14] <wathek> coldhead, and as you can see in the console the new height is returned
[17:05:45] <wathek> coldhead, but I don't understand why when I use the height function to set the new height for my left bar it doesn't work
[17:06:26] <coldhead> wathek: http://www-test.lacriee.com/sites/all/themes/zen/js/adjustcolumnheight.js?mes5fv
[17:06:27] <cantonic> hey guys. can anyone help me with this? https://gist.github.com/4247799 the problem is, that the datetimepicker does not show up. i have wrapped some lines in functions in order to call the same lines multiple times, but i seem to have done a mistake when declaring the function or when calling it.
[17:06:34] <coldhead> i am seeing TWO functions to resize those elements
[17:06:41] <cantonic> the gist contains the file in js format and in coffeescript format
[17:06:44] <coldhead> one bound to #main and one bound to window
[17:06:49] <coldhead> so they are probably both running
[17:06:59] <coldhead> i'm nt sure which order that will happen in
[17:07:03] <coldhead> but maybe they're conflicting
[17:07:15] <wathek> coldhead, the second function is called when the window is resized
[17:07:23] <coldhead> yes i understand
[17:07:28] <wathek> so in this case it shouldn't be called
[17:07:32] <wathek> should it ?
[17:07:40] <coldhead> i would add a console.log to each of them to see which is being called when
[17:07:42] <coldhead> just to be sure
[17:07:50] <wathek> ok let me try
[17:08:38] <wathek> coldhead, added that let's check
[17:08:58] <coldhead> they both always run
[17:09:07] <coldhead> :\
[17:10:22] <wathek> coldhead, huh !
[17:13:01] <cantonic> i figured out my problem. was a typo :( thanks anyways
[17:13:15] <coldhead> great job cantonic, why don't you take a break
[17:13:38] <cantonic> coldhead: looks like i need to
[17:13:48] <coldhead> if anyone wants to repeat their tedious hitherto unanswered questions in the desperate hope of some kind of assistance please feel free
[17:14:19] <cantonic> coldhead: what do you mean by that?
[17:14:37] <coldhead> there were a lot of people asking questions who didn't get answers
[17:14:45] <coldhead> i'm trying to give them hope
[17:14:47] <coldhead> poor buggers
[17:15:31] <cantonic> oh ok. well i don't repost questions, but i let everybody know that my problem is solved so nobody wastes time trying to help me on a solved issue
[17:16:17] <coldhead> yes it's much appreciated cantonic!
[17:16:27] <cantonic> :)
[17:16:41] <coldhead> i just feel bad for the people who didn't get their answers
[17:16:47] <coldhead> but not bad enough to scroll back up
[17:16:51] <coldhead> so i'm inviting reposts
[17:20:31] <cantonic> coldhead: well, most of them resolve their issue by googling but then don't care about telling it to the chan
[17:23:03] <coldhead> i know
[17:23:19] <coldhead> the worst thing is when you fix someone's code and JUST as you go to paste the link the disconnect
[17:23:20] <DJTrey> what should this code be doing? $("table:first > td").remove();
[17:23:33] <coldhead> it should do nothing, DJTrey
[17:23:49] <coldhead> it selects and removes TDs which are the immediate children of the first table
[17:23:57] <DJTrey> ok well i guess it's doing as intended.
[17:23:59] <coldhead> but there should be a <tr> between the table and the <td>
[17:24:05] <DJTrey> I'm trying to remove the first <td> in every table
[17:24:08] <coldhead> so there will be no immediate td children
[17:24:43] <coldhead> $('table tr:nth-child(0) td:nth-child(0)').remove()
[17:24:58] <coldhead> that's the first td of the first tr of every table
[17:25:13] <coldhead> (i hope)
[17:25:24] <DJTrey> let me try
[17:25:53] <ninsei> Is anyone here familier with TestSwarm?
[17:26:56] <DJTrey> my html goes like <table><tbody><tr><td>delete this node</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
[17:27:17] <ninsei> specificly TestSwarm running on Jenkins?
[17:27:26] <DJTrey> coldhead: that didn't workâ€¦.assuming because the tbody you didn't know about
[17:28:10] <coldhead> tbody won't matter
[17:28:14] <coldhead> because i'm not using >
[17:28:20] <agsel> coldhead: I did have a problem with loading jquery twice :) didn't notice that bootstrap loads it also. so, thanks for the pointer!
[17:28:30] <coldhead> good work agsel !
[17:29:25] <agsel> now, a bit different question. I have a table, where I have enabled sortable. can I somehow say that if I move 1st row, 2-5 rows would move along with the first one?
[17:29:39] <coldhead> DJTrey: http://jsfiddle.net/YfBpx/
[17:29:52] <coldhead> sorry, i forgot nth-child counts from 1, not 0
[17:31:33] <DJTrey> ok, yeah it works in jsfiddle
[17:31:37] <DJTrey> www.bgtweets.com
[17:31:44] <DJTrey> but it doesn't work on the live site
[17:32:43] <DJTrey> the news section at the bottom is where I'm trying to remove the first <td>
[17:34:17] <DJTrey> coldhead: got it
[17:34:28] <DJTrey> my }  and ) were flipped
[17:34:34] <DJTrey> thanks for the help though
[17:41:04] <coldhead> great work everyone! let's all take a five minute break
[17:44:03] <MeMReS> DJTrey: still here?
[17:44:12] <DJTrey> yes
[17:44:15] <NLG> coldhead: once your five is up, do you have an idea how I can make resizable trigger my droppable elements? I have a div thats filled with droppable divs, and on top of that, i have a list that has sortable and resizable, and I want the resizable trigger droppable on touch like sortable does on drag.
[17:44:20] <MeMReS> you from Bowling Green/
[17:44:25] <DJTrey> yup
[17:44:25] <DJTrey> why
[17:44:29] <MeMReS> im from Hopkinsville
[17:44:45] <coldhead> i don't even understand the question, NLG. jQuery UI is not my forte
[17:44:52] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using jQuery
[17:45:39] <NLG> Dang. I bet it has something to do with drag event, but i cant figure out how to go about fixing it  :X
[17:45:43] <coldhead> ooh you folks are kentuckians? best music in the world comes out of louisville
[17:45:55] <DJTrey> louisville?
[17:46:02] <DJTrey> what music you like from lville?
[17:46:11] <NLG> Oh well. Now my calendar type thing has a feature that makes you confirm your resize by dragging it a bit :D
[17:46:12] <coldhead> slint, shipping news, rachels
[17:46:17] <coldhead> rodan
[17:46:22] <DJTrey> never heard of 'emâ€¦.
[17:46:26] <coldhead> !!!
[17:46:49] <DJTrey> i go to nashville for my music
[17:46:51] <coldhead> i thought louisville music was an instutution beloved to all kentuckians
[17:46:57] <coldhead> that's how it seems from here anyway
[17:47:17] <DJTrey> no, louisville is known for horses and bourbon
[17:47:20] <DJTrey> not really music
[17:48:04] <coldhead> da,m, you're missing out son
[17:48:09] * DJTrey is listening to I Still Like Bologna by Alan Jackson from Good Time
[17:48:15] <DJTrey> you're missin out
[17:48:33] <coldhead> let's take this outside
[17:48:47] <coldhead> this looks interesting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly%E2%80%93Hopkinsville_encounter
[17:48:54] <coldhead> i <3 kentucky
[17:49:26] <DJTrey> ha
[17:50:43] <MeMReS> coldhead: that happend to my friend's great grandparents
[17:50:56] <coldhead> no way!
[17:51:04] <coldhead> i have to read up on this
[17:51:09] <coldhead> I TOLD YOU KENTUCKY WAS AWESOME
[17:51:42] <DJTrey> john carpenter is from bowling green and there are references in his Halloween movies
[17:51:50] <DJTrey> kentucky is awesome
[17:55:40] <DJTrey> bot-t: how many days til Christmas?
[17:55:41] <bot-t> DJTrey, Ask again later.
[17:55:46] <DJTrey> :(
[17:56:00] <hugo_moss> coldhead: ive tried to narrow it down, but you can't tell with this testcase
[17:56:05] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/vgf77/21/
[17:56:12] <hugo_moss> i have the site live
[17:56:17] <hugo_moss> if i can show you that as well
[17:58:38] <coldhead> hugo_moss: http://jsfiddle.net/vgf77/22/
[17:58:49] <coldhead> i think you need .off('some event here')
[17:58:52] <coldhead> rather than just off()
[17:58:57] <coldhead> you need to tell it which events
[17:59:37] <hugo_moss> i think i remember, that it detaches all handlers associated with that class
[17:59:45] <hugo_moss> if i remember right
[18:00:08] <hugo_moss> the problem is, when i insert off() at the beginning of topHandler
[18:00:15] <hugo_moss> and on before the return false
[18:00:33] <coldhead> "All events of all types in a specific namespace can be removed from an element by providing just a namespace, such as ".myPlugin". At minimum, either a namespace or event name must be provided."
[18:00:39] <hugo_moss> when i click on a brand, each click adds something, and gets slower
[18:00:47] <hugo_moss> and slower until it freezes
[18:01:01] <coldhead> because you aren't removing handlers
[18:01:02] <hugo_moss> oh sorry
[18:01:04] <hugo_moss> thanks
[18:01:13] <hugo_moss> i think i did that just on jsfiddle though
[18:01:16] <hugo_moss> one sec
[18:04:00] <hugo_moss> damn you're right
[18:04:03] <hugo_moss> its working now
[18:04:07] <hugo_moss> haha, thanks
[18:04:14] <tw2113> take 5 coldhead
[18:04:21] <tw2113> you helped your first person
[18:04:34] <coldhead> I FEEL SO ALIVE
[18:04:47] <coldhead> i'd like to thank god and quincy jones and all the little people who made this possible
[18:05:03] <Henry_> Hello all, I'm trying to create a fly-in menu- for some reason it is not working; nothing is happening. It is at 4h9j.localtunnel.com .. any ideas on what is causing it to malfunction?
[18:05:08] <MeMReS> lmao
[18:07:05] <Henry_> Any recommendations?
[18:07:26] <MeMReS> SCRIPT5009: 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹' is undefined
[18:07:26] <MeMReS> 4h9j.localtunnel.com, line 89 character 3
[18:08:49] <Henry_> MeMReS: What?
[18:09:13] <MeMReS> you got some wierd characters at the end of your your script
[18:09:18] <hugo_moss> coldhead, the second problem i have is a memory leak. every time i click brands, it basically does an ajax call, retrieves 3 pictures at a time, and on every click about 50-100 kilobytes of memory is leaked
[18:09:55] <coldhead> that's hard to debug, hugo_moss
[18:10:00] <hugo_moss> oop
[18:10:01] <hugo_moss> i was wrong
[18:10:04] <hugo_moss> the gc ran
[18:10:08] <hugo_moss> it recovered the memory
[18:10:17] <hugo_moss> went from 37 to 22
[18:10:19] <hugo_moss> mb
[18:10:25] <hugo_moss> thank you, kind sir
[18:10:34] <coldhead> phew, didn't want to have to debug that anyway
[18:10:46] <coldhead> i must remember to tell people "just wait for the GC" when they talk about memory leaks
[18:10:54] <coldhead> it's a good exit strategy
[18:11:23] <Henry_> MeMReS: please see source code.. there is no weird character...
[18:12:56] <MeMReS> its there, line 93 );Ã¢â‚¬â€¹
[18:14:54] <Henry_> MeMReS: Oh wow that didnt appear in sublime. But' its still not working.
[18:16:49] <MeMReS> your positioning for CSS should be absolute
[18:19:40] <hugo_moss> hmm no, memory leak is still there sadly
[18:19:43] <Henry_> MeMReS: Which id?
[18:20:11] <hugo_moss> coldhead: the ajax call is just a couple of lines of code, for some reason that might be causing the problem
[18:20:22] <aqeel> hi room
[18:20:40] <hugo_moss> i read that ajax calls leak in jquery like a fountain, at least thats what a website said
[18:20:55] <aqeel> x: (document.all ? (!de.scrollLeft ? b.scrollLeft : de.scrollLeft) : (window.pageXOffset ? window.pageXOffset : window.scrollX))
[18:21:01] <aqeel> how to make use of ||
[18:21:14] <aqeel> do i need to if else it..??
[18:21:52] <Henry_> anybody willing to take a look at http://4h9j.localtunnel.com/ ? It's made to be a page with a fly-in menu... its not working... any help would be very much appreciated.
[18:24:30] <Henry_> Any recommendations?
[18:25:36] <Henry_> yes - no - maybe so?
[18:25:49] <NLG> What ruins resizables ability to figure out the elements size and position? when I try to resize the dimentions go all haywire
[18:26:28] <NLG> Good lord this seems to be a buggy thing, or then I just dont know how to use it poperly :D
[18:26:37] <MeMReS> Henry_ get my PM?
[18:27:15] <aqeel> x= (document.all = (!de.scrollLeft = b.scrollLeft || de.scrollLeft) || (window.pageXOffset = window.pageXOffset || window.scrollX))
[18:27:27] <aqeel> is this correct?
[18:27:39] <juboba> hey, I'm trying to make an ajax request setting timeout to 50000 miliseconds
[18:27:51] <juboba> but the ajax request gets made inmediately
[18:29:25] <juboba> i.e. function something(){ $.ajax({... complete: something, timeout: 50000});
[18:29:27] <NLG> juboba: isnt timeout usually just a ..timeout when the call will be terminated if it doesnt respond in that time and not a timer?
[18:29:52] <NLG> and not a timer
[18:30:47] <juboba> I was reading this:
[18:30:49] <juboba> Timeout: Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request. The timeout period starts at the point the $.ajax call is made. Here, we set the timeout to 30 seconds. This means our poll function won't get called again until both the ajax call is complete and (at-least) thirty (30) seconds have passed.
[18:32:49] <tw2113> hey coldhead wanna look crazy with me?
[18:32:59] <NLG> The poll function is propably the callback function
[18:33:07] <juboba> NLG http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[18:35:00] <juboba> NLG any ideas?
[18:35:03] <NLG> Using the Closure technique, poll becomes a self executing JavaScript function that runs the first time automatically.
[18:35:23] <Whirl3d> Good evening #jquery.
[18:35:29] <NLG> So the first time is as fast as it can be, and the next one will be after 30s
[18:36:31] <Henry_> MeMReS: Yes, thank you.
[18:36:39] <NLG> But i'm not too good tbh juboba, im kinda in the middle of my own little panic and trying to fix this up before i have to present it in a few hours :DD
[18:37:59] <NLG> But im sure you'll figure it out!
[18:38:05] <NLG> :P
[18:39:26] <juboba> thanks NLG
[18:39:29] <juboba> ;)
[18:42:19] <hateIE> whats a google color picker that will return rgba() ?
[18:42:26] <hateIE> wth
[18:43:05] <hateIE> a good.. ^
[18:43:14] <treeprogram> hi, I'm trying to create an 'expander' effect like seen in Chrome settings (click 'Settings', at the bottom you'll see a '+ Show advanced settings' link that expands to show the settings), but I'm a jQuery beginner, so don't know where to start looking. Any pointers?
[18:45:13] <juboba> NLG, why is the function `poll` in parentheses? (function(){})(); ?
[18:48:48] <NLG> Ah, he quit
[18:50:28] <coldhead> hate when that happens
[18:51:17] <david`> don't you NLG, everything is going to be fine!
[18:52:04] <NLG> :D
[18:52:55] <david`> *don't you worry
[18:53:04] <NLG> Seriously though, this jquery ui does some black voodoo behind the scenes and fails at it. Some really weird things is going on
[18:53:05] <david`> I'm fucked up -_-
[18:53:27] <NLG> If i start my resize, my element's sizes change and its not consistent
[18:53:39] <NLG> What's your deal then?
[18:53:45] <sealeaf1> Hi, I'm using jquery.attr('visibility', 'visible') to show something when a button is clicked
[18:53:53] <sealeaf1> But it's not working for some reason
[18:54:06] <sealeaf1> (Sorry, I meant jquery.prop) - not working either
[18:54:49] <NLG> sealeaf1: just try jquery.show().
[18:55:03] <NLG> and remember, jquery part hast to be an element
[18:56:09] <sealeaf1> NLG: Not working. When you say that it has to be an element, is $('.user_new') wrong? .user_new is a div
[18:57:22] <aqeel> x: (document.all ? (!de.scrollLeft ? b.scrollLeft : de.scrollLeft) : (window.pageXOffset ? window.pageXOffset : window.scrollX))
[18:57:32] <aqeel> how to make use of || and not break the code
[18:58:34] <coldhead> that code should be taken outside and shot, aqeel
[18:58:39] <coldhead> rewrite it to make it readable
[18:58:48] <coldhead> i vomit in my mouth when i try to read that
[18:59:02] <coldhead> nested ternary operators are the very devil
[18:59:02] <aqeel> haha
[18:59:09] <aqeel> it is in plugin....lol
[18:59:19] <coldhead> which plugin?!
[18:59:21] <aqeel> that is why i am here
[18:59:24] <coldhead> i will email them to complain
[18:59:51] <aqeel>  http://jdsharp.us/code/AutoScroll/
[18:59:57] <aqeel> see the js file
[19:00:50] <coldhead> it's slightly less hideous when it's formatted like that
[19:00:55] <coldhead> but seriously blergh
[19:01:15] <coldhead> why do you need to use || ?
[19:01:22] <aqeel> jslint
[19:01:40] <coldhead> fuuuck
[19:02:03] <aqeel> yeah....
[19:02:57] <NLG> sealeaf1: yea, if you have a div that has class user_new, then $('.user_new').show() should do just fine
[19:03:07] <coldhead> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/ezQGw/
[19:03:15] <coldhead> i think that's the same but i am vomiting too much to check
[19:03:15] <NLG> OKAY WHY
[19:03:23] <sealeaf1> NLG: Hmm, changed it to .css('visibility', 'visible') and it works now.
[19:03:26] <NLG> Why are some of my divs different sizes? O_o
[19:06:29] <aqeel> well seems a bit wrong
[19:06:55] <aqeel> it is !de.scrollLeft ? b.scrollLeft : de.scrollLeft
[19:07:06] <aqeel> see !de.scrollLeft
[19:09:08] <coldhead> if (de.ScrollLeft == null) return b.scrollLeft else return de.scrollLeft
[19:09:25] <coldhead> return de.scrollLeft || b.scrollLeft
[19:09:29] <coldhead> looks the same to me
[19:09:43] <coldhead> one important difference is that you care, aqeel
[19:09:51] <coldhead> whereas i simply wish that i were dead
[19:10:06] <NLG> Ooo, like minded people, we should meet!
[19:10:18] <NLG> Maybe a date on a cemetery or something?
[19:10:37] <coldhead> you have way too much lust for life for me, NLG
[19:10:46] <axscode> alert($("#quotes-pane [name$=panes[quotes][uid]]").value());  <-- hi guys, im wondering do i have to escape this \[ \]
[19:10:48] <coldhead> i only like people who can't stand to be around me
[19:11:11] <NLG> Someone calls that ambition
[19:16:16] <axscode> <input type="hidden" name="panes[quotes][uid]" value="1">  <--- what should be the selector for this asside from input type=hidden ?
[19:16:53] <aqeel> ok tha is done...last error in jslint...The body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype.

[19:17:37] <coldhead> it's very tedious
[19:17:48] <coldhead> why are you using jslint instead of jshint anyway?

[19:56:56] <w00tner> can anyone give help me please
[19:57:16] <w00tner> worst sentence ever.. can anyone help me please*
[19:58:20] <systemfault> w00tner: You're trying to call jQuery functions on a DOM node.
[19:58:31] <systemfault> Make it a jQuery object before.
[20:00:53] <w00tner> how
[20:01:51] <tw2113> w00tner, i don't think this is even a jquery question, it's straight js
[20:03:59] <w00tner> so how can i approach this i have no clue
[20:05:30] <tw2113> keep trying, trial and error, read docs
[20:05:37] <tw2113> google errors
[20:06:17] <tw2113> check the examples that fabric.js offers to see what's working there
[20:06:21] <coldhead> try { ur_code_here() } catch (err) {};
[20:09:35] <w00tner> thanks
[20:10:01] <w00tner> at least i almost done i hope not get stuck in this last issue
[20:15:45] <L1> Anyone familiar with Select2? I am calling it on a input[text] with "data: someArrayOfData". I would like to call it with multiple arrays of data, and have them split into groups, as is shown on their demo page with <optgroup>s
[20:16:44] <w00tner> how can i define the canvas to work with ?    <canvas id="c" width="221px" height="370px" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></canvas>
[20:17:05] <yarco> $('a[href^= (http|https)://]') doesn't work, any idea to select <a> with href begin with http or https
[20:17:19] <w00tner> when it starts it creates a new fabric var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('c');     but if i use it while trying to add another object it clears the canvas....so how can i just define in which canvas i will work with
[20:17:38] <snover> yarco: at what point did you get the impression that css supports regular expressions
[20:18:10] <yarco> snover: but jQuery support  $('a[href=^http://]')
[20:18:26] <yarco> href=^ => href^=
[20:18:50] <snover> and how is that a regular expression?
[20:25:31] <yarco> snover: strange, even $('a[href^=http://%5D') can not work...but it is written in <jQuery in Action>
[20:25:46] <yarco> => http://]
[20:27:34] <yarco> sorry, it should be href^="http://" ...
[21:01:41] <R00tk3y> Anyone here use WOWZA?
[21:02:41] <coldhead> "Streaming Media Magazine's #1 choice for a media server."
[21:02:49] <coldhead> TIL there is a Streaming Media Magazine
[21:03:57] <R00tk3y> Lol wut cold
[21:04:14] <shoky> wut wut
[21:04:24] <coldhead> i have never used it nor heard of it until this moment sorry
[21:04:44] <coldhead> i hear it has A 99% OVERALL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RATING.
[21:05:09] <shoky> wowza
[21:05:14] <coldhead> quite
[21:05:33] <R00tk3y> Yeah it looks amazing
[21:05:35] <R00tk3y> And its hella cheap
[21:05:52] <R00tk3y> Not no 4,000 dollar empire that its ran by stupid adobe flash
[21:06:41] <R00tk3y> Its time google comes in and just destroys Adobes flashconomy
[21:07:41] <R00tk3y> Shoky u know about wowza
[21:08:47] <coldhead> i think shoky reads Streaming Media Magazine
[21:09:07] <R00tk3y> thats great
[21:09:39] <R00tk3y> I could probably crack WowZa with good old OllyDbg and idapro
[21:09:50] <R00tk3y> And get it for free
[21:10:00] <coldhead> but you wouldn't do that because it would be immoral and illegal
[21:10:02] <R00tk3y> But, since they saved me so much money from buying a flash server
[21:10:03] <coldhead> so we're all good
[21:10:10] <R00tk3y> Exactly
[21:10:18] <R00tk3y> Its not immoral to crack something
[21:10:42] <R00tk3y> Its hella good
[21:10:44] <R00tk3y> So im not going to
[21:10:50] <R00tk3y> And cheap as fuck
[21:12:11] <shoky> R00tk3y no i just learned about it now as well
[21:12:24] <coldhead> did you read about it in Streaming Media Magazine, shoky?
[21:12:46] <R00tk3y> I was gonna use viddler
[21:12:48] <shoky> yes, after buying all copies
[21:13:09] <R00tk3y> But then I wanted to host my own content, so then I look at FMS, too expensive, 2 hours later, found this
[21:13:40] <shoky> what's da content
[21:13:46] <R00tk3y> pr0n
[21:13:52] <shoky> KewL
[21:14:10] <shoky> homemade?
[21:14:11] <coldhead> ah whence the morality vacuum
[21:14:19] <R00tk3y> No

[21:14:23] <R00tk3y> hosted in asia
[21:14:26] <R00tk3y> China*
[21:14:36] <shoky> mm chinese porn
[21:14:43] <coldhead> the most moral kind of porn there is
[21:14:46] <R00tk3y> Small titty high pitch asians
[21:14:47] <shoky> l0l
[21:15:07] <R00tk3y> Sounds like ur killing a rabbit

[21:21:14] <Coreidan> woot, sure!
[21:26:34] <mdedetrich> what does it mean if a context is undefined when doing a selection
[21:26:43] <R00tk3y> idk bro
[21:26:46] <R00tk3y> why dont u show some code
[21:27:32] <mdedetrich> I really wouldn't be able to show why its hapenning since the code is hundreds of lines long
[21:27:59] <mdedetrich> Im just asking, if you do a standard DOM selector using $ and console.log the output, its saying that the context is undefiend
[21:28:03] <R00tk3y> Excellent
[21:28:06] <mdedetrich> im wondering what that means
[21:28:30] <mdedetrich> R00tk3y: [<div>, prevObject: p.fn.p.init[1], context: undefined, selector: ".facebookPost"]
[21:28:34] <mdedetrich> thats what I mean
[21:28:42] <R00tk3y> no clue
[21:28:52] <shoky> mdedetrich:
[21:29:02] <mdedetrich> shoky?
[21:29:04] <shoky> $('.facebookPost', someContext)
[21:29:07] <shoky> that would make a context
[21:29:15] <mdedetrich> what is context?
[21:29:26] <mdedetrich> (or is context meant to be this?)
[21:29:37] <Cork> $('.facebookPost', someContext) === $(someContext).find('.facebookPost')
[21:29:44] <coldhead> ?w context
[21:29:45] <bot-t> coldhead, ConTeXt - ConTeXt is a general-purpose document processor. It is especially suited for structured documents, automated document production, very fine typography, and multi-lingual typesetting. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt
[21:29:48] <shoky> it's internal to jquery anyway..
[21:30:00] <shoky> there doesnt need to be a context
[21:30:23] <mdedetrich> well its causing find to fail
[21:30:39] <shoky> fail?
[21:31:01] <shoky> probably the first selector didnt find anything..
[21:31:04] <mdedetrich> would context being undefined have to do with the jquery HTML not being inserted into the document yet (but still being defined)
[21:31:29] <shoky> how is find failing?
[21:31:33] <mdedetrich> well the thing is, its still finding something (length of selection is one), its just that jquery is unable to do anything with that selection
[21:31:44] <shoky> unable to do anything?
[21:31:49] <shoky> stop speaking in codewords
[21:32:01] <mdedetrich> ok, ill try explain this better
[21:32:03] <Cork> mdedetrich: are you doing something like $('', '') ?
[21:32:07] <mdedetrich> no
[21:32:14] <mdedetrich> what I am doing, is creating some dynamic HTML
[21:32:25] <mdedetrich> that HTML is then put into dom with $(html)
[21:32:38] <Cork> that doesn't put it into the dom
[21:32:42] <Cork> that just parses it
[21:32:45] <mdedetrich> at THIS point it is not inserted into the document at all
[21:32:47] <Cork> into a fragment
[21:33:41] <Cork> mdedetrich: make sure that the strings are correctly escaped and that the html is valid
[21:33:45] <mdedetrich> im just trying to think of a way to explain this, changing the order of the code makes my code work perfectly
[21:33:51] <mdedetrich> its nothing to do with the actual HTML
[21:34:19] <Cork> mdedetrich: without seeing the code/html you will have to dig on you're own
[21:34:36] <mdedetrich> I know what the issue is myself, I am just trying to solve it
[21:34:40] <Cork> explaining won't do anyone here any wiser into why you get the problem
[21:35:07] <Cork> mdedetrich: the context problem is most likely a symptom of something else
[21:35:09] <mdedetrich> essentially context is undefined because the html isn't into DOM with backbones el
[21:35:16] <mdedetrich> gets instantiated
[21:35:53] <mdedetrich> *essentially context is undefined because the html isn't into DOM when backbones el gets instantiated with that DOM
[21:36:10] <Cork> so you have a race condition?
[21:36:14] <mdedetrich> Cork: this would solve my issue, how do you set context to be the root condition
[21:36:18] <mdedetrich> *root document
[21:36:21] <mdedetrich> Cork: essentially yes
[21:36:23] <Cork> you don't
[21:36:33] <Cork> you never have to
[21:36:44] <mdedetrich> so why is there code that lets you set context?
[21:37:21] <Cork> if you want so specify another limiting element then the root
[21:37:39] <Cork> context is just a shorthand
[21:37:39] <mdedetrich> are you saying that context should never be set using $('.facebookPost', someContext)?
[21:37:48] <Cork> $() <-- context .find(selector)
[21:38:07] <Cork> no i'm saying that if you want the root, you don't have to
[21:38:20] <Cork> cause it's always the root unless you specify otherwise
[21:38:23] <mdedetrich> Cork: the way I want to solve my race condition, is to specify on instantation, the context will be root (although in reality it isn't at that time)
[21:38:54] <mdedetrich> currently on instantiation, context is null, so how do I set it to the proper value (which I KNOW will exist in the future)
[21:38:55] <Cork> mdedetrich: what you prob want is to parse the html earlier
[21:39:04] <Cork> store the parsed html and search in that fragment
[21:39:19] <mdedetrich> Cork: that breaks a lot of stuff in rendering
[21:39:25] <Cork> no
[21:39:39] <Cork> parsing and storing in a variable before you add it
[21:39:46] <mdedetrich> its what I meant when I said [16:33:45] <mdedetrich>	 im just trying to think of a way to explain this, changing the order of the code makes my code work perfectly
[21:39:50] <Cork> changes absolutely nothing in rendering
[21:39:50] <mdedetrich> no it really does
[21:40:03] <Cork> then you're doing something else
[21:40:22] <mdedetrich> im just trying to say this code is not trivial....
[21:40:27] <Cork> mdedetrich: and is why i said the code is an absolute must, cause you're currently missing the problem
[21:40:59] <mdedetrich> Cork: if I change it to what you are saying, it breaks part of the site
[21:41:06] <mdedetrich> Cork: can you just tell me how to set context?
[21:41:12] <Cork> you can't
[21:41:22] <Cork> if the element isn't in the dom, its not in the dom
[21:41:31] <Cork> you can't find something thats not there
[21:41:31] <mdedetrich> so what is $('.facebookPost', someContext) then?
[21:41:48] <Cork> is a short hand for $(someContext).find('facebookPost')
[21:42:04] <Cork> ?.find
[21:42:05] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[21:43:48] <Cork> * $(someContext).find('.facebookPost')
[21:45:16] <tw2113> shorthand is awesome once you learn about it, a bitch if you're just learning and don't know what's going on
[21:45:34] <coldhead> training to be a secretary tw2113?
[21:46:20] <Cork> i think that specifical shorthand is really problematic
[21:46:35] <Cork> cause it doesn't make any sense from just looking at it
[21:46:47] <tw2113> yours, actually
[21:47:07] <Cork> the attributes is in the wrong order and everything
[21:47:25] <coldhead> i welcome this development, tw2113. please collect my dry cleaning
[21:47:45] <tw2113> got it, give dry cleaning to sumatran rat monkeys
[21:48:23] <Cork> uh... secretaries normally don't do laundry...
[21:48:28] <coldhead> i don't want to know the details
[21:48:32] <coldhead> just get it done toots
[21:48:39] <mdedetrich> Cork: I have solved the issue, although it is somewhat of a hack, and didn't really solve my ultimate problem
[21:48:44] <Cork> at least not as the job description
[21:49:03] <mdedetrich> Cork: going to have to redesign part of my code
[21:49:10] <coldhead> my job description didn't say nothing about 90% of the things i do
[21:49:15] * coldhead shudders
[21:49:56] <mdedetrich> sigh, the issues in making your code too generic
[21:50:15] <Cork> generic has nothing to do with it
[21:51:05] <mdedetrich> Cork: it does in my case
[21:51:24] <mdedetrich> but im not going to bother try explaining, I just have to delegate events in a different way
[21:56:12] <mdedetrich> Cork: I have to make a factory to manage all my instances of a backbone 'class', and have that factory delegate events to specific instances of the class, instead of having the class instance delegate events itself
[22:02:06] <raj> mr. shoky, you around?
[22:05:55] <shoky> sup raj
[22:07:14] <raj> hey lover, pm
[22:08:42] <coldhead> o_O
[22:09:00] <shoky> ^^
[22:09:27] <shoky> i have never met this man.
[22:11:17] <tw2113> in an alley maybe
[22:12:09] <tw2113> hey coldhead, i have your new jam http://heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa.com/
[22:13:15] <coldhead> hey thanks
[22:13:25] <coldhead> this brings back a lot of great memories
[22:21:33] <ghs> Can someone me help ? The code: http://pastebin.com/TTqx2QYZ send data for my servlet, however, always appears the message of error. Why ?
[22:22:18] <Cork> ghs: what is the error?
[22:22:25] <tw2113> because your url is a string and not a valid url
[22:22:36] <tw2113> is my first guess
[22:22:45] <Cork> it might actually be
[22:23:06] <Cork> if its a relative url that is
[22:23:21] <tw2113> got me there
[22:23:33] <Cork> not saying you're wrong though ;)
[22:23:45] <tw2113> i assume i'm wrong till someone tells me i'm right
[22:23:49] <tw2113> then i get better elation
[22:23:50] <Cork> ya
[22:24:10] <tw2113> or assuming i'm right until i'm told i'm wrong and feel down on myself
[22:24:15] <tw2113> causing me to drink the rest of the night away
[22:24:25] <tw2113> no one needs to be coldhead's ex
[22:34:12] <coldhead> :(
[22:57:43] <thestereobus> hey hey.  I'm just starting to get into deferreds - awesome.  But $.when seems inconsistent between singular and multiple deferreds passed in.  Singular seems to pass the response obj to done that you'd expect in a success callback whereas the multiple deferred case passes the xhr objects.  I get why this isâ€¦ but is there a good way to make it consistent between the two cases?  Right now I'm doing $.when(some_query, {}) to make it always act like
[22:57:43] <thestereobus> the multiple case (for better code re-use WRT the callback).
[22:58:13] <thestereobus> $.when(some_query) vs. $.when(some_query, another_query)
[23:00:18] <thestereobus> I wish it would always just hand the .done callback the same xhr object
[23:00:53] <Cork> thestereobus: it comes from the fact that when does nothing if it's given one deferred
[23:00:58] <Cork> it just passes it along
[23:01:13] <thestereobus> I see
[23:01:42] <Cork> while if its more then one it creates a wrapper deferred around them
[23:03:30] <thestereobus> basically I have a common function that gets called in singular and multiple cases but I don't want to have special logic to sort out whether it's an xhr or not.  so in the singular I'm doing $.when(query, {}) - do you think that will be detrimental in any way, besides the second parameter being superfluous?
[23:04:07] <thestereobus> per the docs if when gets a non-deferred object it just considers it resolved
[23:04:18] <Cork> thestereobus: though what is the difference you're seeing?
[23:04:40] <Cork> cause looking at the code it carefully lifts both the arguments and context over
[23:04:49] <Cork> so, not sure what would differ
[23:05:23] <thestereobus> let's say I'm getting back json {foo: bar} from the backend.  in the singular case I'm seeing function(rsp){ console.log (rsp) } emitting {foo: bar}
[23:05:44] <thestereobus> in the multiple case I'm seeing something like [rsp, "success", xhr_stuff]
[23:05:56] <Cork> ah
[23:05:59] <thestereobus> erâ€¦ [{foo: bar}, "success", xhr_stuff]
[23:06:16] <Cork> ya, thats the context and value arrays
[23:06:31] <Cork> contexts[ i ] = this;
[23:06:32] <Cork> values[ i ] = arguments.length > 1 ? core_slice.call( arguments ) : value;
[23:06:40] * Cork nods
[23:06:44] <thestereobus> yeah, I'm cool with that.  I just don't wanna do arg[0] in some cases and arg in others with the same method, you know?
[23:06:56] <Cork> ya
[23:06:58] <Cork> hmm
[23:07:12] <thestereobus> so $.when(query, {}) forces the wrapping with no delay penalty
[23:07:22] <thestereobus> just to get it to treat it in that manner
[23:07:26] <Cork> ya, you do get some memory overhead though
[23:07:34] <thestereobus> sure
[23:08:24] <Cork> and no, the optimization they do, gives that effect
[23:09:29] <thestereobus> or I could wrap done and make my own function to always pass arg[0] to normalize it to the singular style
[23:09:35] <grass7boy> hello
[23:09:38] <grass7boy> is there any way
[23:09:58] <grass7boy> to change document.readyState to inactive when the readyState is loading ??
[23:10:01] <Cork> thestereobus: or make you're own copy of when, that's consistent
[23:10:42] <Cork> thestereobus: its only 41 lines of code, and that's including comments
[23:10:46] <thestereobus> $.whenIWasAKid
[23:10:50] <thestereobus> lol
[23:11:04] <thestereobus> cool.  thanks for the help
[23:11:54] <thestereobus> or $.whenIWasYourAge
[23:13:02] <Cork> grass7boy: that pref is only for initial load
[23:14:01] <Cork> grass7boy: and no it only gives the states it gives, there's no options for it
[23:14:48] <grass7boy> well okok...
[23:15:27] <grass7boy> i just found that when i load another javascript from 3rd party
[23:15:48] <grass7boy> the document.readyState will be change to inactive
[23:16:40] <Cork> grass7boy: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#current-document-readiness
[23:16:48] <grass7boy> then if i call $.ajax(async:false, success: function(){document.write("...")})
[23:16:48] <Cork> scroll up to the green box just above
[23:16:57] <grass7boy> the page will be erased
[23:17:00] <Cork> ouch
[23:17:04] <Cork> don't use document.write!
[23:17:55] <grass7boy> is there some reference to explain why don't we use  document.write
[23:18:11] <Cork> document.write was implemented in pre dom1
[23:18:34] <Cork> its terribly old and has loads of oddities
[23:18:37] <grass7boy> i know it doesn't work in ajax environment
[23:18:49] <Cork> you should never EVER use it
[23:19:11] <Cork> if you have to get similar effects use a dom element and innerHTML = "...";
[23:19:13] <grass7boy> will... i'll talk to my team member again
[23:19:23] <systemfault> Or fire him...
[23:21:11] <Cork> grass7boy: and ya, the erased behavior of document.write is one of its oddities
[23:22:32] <Cork> basically document.write only works if the script you run in has a page position reference
[23:23:01] <Cork> and if it doens't it replace the entire page == document.body.innerHTML = 'text';
[23:23:18] <grass7boy> and the page position can not be access through another native javascript?
[23:23:53] <Cork> doucment.write is pre the concept of dom
[23:24:11] <Cork> so you put a script tag at a position and document.write "replaced" it
[23:24:22] <Cork> modern solutions use dom references instead
[23:24:29] <grass7boy> hmm...
[23:24:32] <grass7boy> okok...
[23:24:47] <Cork> like <div id="replaced context"></div><script></script>
[23:24:51] <systemfault> document.write can only be called safely when the page is first being parsed...
[23:24:53] <Cork> opps
[23:24:55] <Cork> like <div id="replaced-context"></div><script></script>
[23:25:03] <Cork> ya
[23:25:07] <systemfault> If you call it when the DOM is ready.. it will kill the whole page.
[23:25:10] <Cork> and not always then
[23:25:47] <grass7boy> yeah... in our page ... we call it when the page is loading....
[23:26:10] <Cork> didn't you say you called it in an ajax response?
[23:26:21] <grass7boy> yeah
[23:26:33] <grass7boy> but is through $.ajax(async:false )
[23:26:34] <Cork> then the async nature of it will call if after its ready
[23:26:37] <Cork> ah
[23:26:45] <Cork> thats another big problem you should never to
[23:26:54] <grass7boy> !!!
[23:27:04] <Cork> ajax should never be made synchronous
[23:27:16] <thestereobus> unless you're doing something like unloading the page
[23:27:18] <Cork> it will freeze the page and in some cases the entire browser
[23:27:18] <thestereobus> but yeah
[23:27:52] <Cork> and synchronous, ajax calls is legacy, and only maintained
[23:27:59] <Cork> it gets no new features, or updates
[23:28:06] <Cork> only async get them
[23:28:36] <Cork> never to == never do
[23:29:09] <grass7boy> okok...
[23:29:17] <Cork> synchronous ajax calls will kill some dom events
[23:29:27] <grass7boy> i think there are many modification in my project
[23:29:33] <Cork> and give inconstancies if focus events and other mad things
[23:29:41] <grass7boy> thanks you alot
[23:43:13] <Cork> grass7boy: just a side note https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558972
[23:43:14] <Cork> :)
[23:43:23] <Cork> just to show how much so it is
[23:54:22] <anli__> I cant set the value of a jquery ui slider to what I want, it becomes max instead
[23:54:31] <anli__> But if I pick another value, its ok
[23:54:36] <anli__> It seems to be driven by magic
[23:55:20] <Cork> anli__: you're settig it to something heigher then max or what?
[23:56:29] <anli__> No, I use div.slider({min:0, max: 200, value: 30}); then it goes to 200
[23:56:34] <anli__> But if I pick 20 instead, its ok
[23:57:02] <anli__> With goes to 200, I mean that the value becomes 200
[23:57:07] <Cork> you think you could generate a fiddle with the effect?
[23:57:08] <anli__> Its a min range slider
[23:57:30] <anli__> I updated jquery and jquery ui because I read there were some bug fixes, but that did not fix my problem
