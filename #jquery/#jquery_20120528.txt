[01:08:00] <wodemaye__> can the headers setting of an ajax request be used to spoof the http referrer?
[01:24:11] <g0ng> I need a help on jquery mobile. I am developing an android app with phonegap, jquery & jquery mobile. I am trying to make an ajax call to an internal server. From android emulator to access i.e. 192.168.0.2 do I need to use jsonp? or simple json?
[01:30:13] <SirCmpwn> I wish to make one text box have the same text as the other
[01:30:31] <SirCmpwn> $("#tb1").val($("#tb2").val()); did not work
[01:31:08] <SirCmpwn> oh, whoops, it worked fine
[01:31:10] <SirCmpwn> move along
[01:34:34] <g0ng> anybody for ajax calls from android applications?
[02:13:10] <wodemaye__> hi... how can i set a custom referer header on an ajax request?
[02:14:22] <B_Lizzard> Hi, I'm having an issue on one of my websites where the .fadeIn/.fadeOut animation will stay stuck on a certain value
[02:14:34] <B_Lizzard> I cannot figure this thing out
[02:14:43] <tga> is there a good way of reinitializing a page?
[02:14:43] <B_Lizzard> http://spartanagroland.gr/203/recipes
[02:14:53] <tga> document.ready() doesn't seem to like being triggered manually
[02:15:11] <B_Lizzard> Clicking on the recipes a few times will make it stick
[02:15:42] <B_Lizzard> log outputs right before the .fadeIn call
[02:15:53] <B_Lizzard> But not inside the callback
[02:24:11] <B_Lizzard> tga window.location?
[02:24:51] <B_Lizzard> Though I guess that's reloading, not reinitializing.
[02:25:59] <joelbirch> tga you could put everything that goes in .ready into a function that you can give to .ready() and also call separately
[02:26:25] <tga> I want to load random content into a page that's already created
[02:26:54] <tga> if the content has ready() calls will they still execute?
[02:28:21] * tga is trying to set up client-side page templating
[02:29:31] <joelbirch> I doubt it
[02:29:50] <joelbirch> actually, maybe
[02:30:40] <joelbirch> if you enter this into a console:
[02:30:41] <joelbirch> jQuery(function(){alert('fired instantly');});
[02:30:47] <joelbirch> it does fire straight away
[02:46:08] <xiaoneng101> \quit
[02:48:22] <Kingsy> what is the best way to toggle a classname? say class="someclass open"   and on a click event you wanted to toggle open with close and close with open ?
[02:48:46] <Kingsy> I guess I could use addClass and removeClass but that would involve quite a few lines
[02:48:56] <joelbirch> .toggleClass('open')
[02:49:40] <Kingsy> oh, I guess the usage of "close" is redundent anyway.. if the css is setup right
[02:49:40] <Kingsy> lol
[02:49:48] <joelbirch> yep
[02:50:31] <Kingsy> sorry about that thgen :P
[03:03:44] <Eshu> Hi
[03:03:47] <Eshu> Guy's
[03:04:17] <Eshu> I want to show edit and delete button on mouse hover over div
[03:04:20] <Eshu> ?
[03:06:02] <hooloovoo> Eshu: you'd prolly be better off doing that in css.
[03:06:28] <Eshu> hooloovoo: any example/
[03:06:40] <pedro370> greetings
[03:06:47] <hooloovoo> #div:hover .editandledetebox { display: block; }
[03:07:13] <Eshu> hooloovoo: thnx.
[03:33:51] <Kingsy> guys, if I have a web application that already drops two cookies, and I am creating a js menu that needs to have its current state remembered across page loads, is it possible to insert the information into an already active cookie? or do I have to create a new one? I don't really know much about cookies :)
[03:34:11] <Kingsy> I don't even know if cookies are editable for security.. not sure
[03:34:47] <woozly> hi guys
[03:35:12] <woozly> does jQuery have something like 'live()' for variables? on changing of variable
[03:35:23] <woozly> for example on array, which pushed or appended
[03:41:41] <B_Lizzard> woozly, you could set up a custom event
[03:42:00] <B_Lizzard> And just call that whenever you need it.
[03:42:11] <woozly> B_Lizzard: how? can you give me a link?
[03:43:53] <B_Lizzard> Set it up with '$(document).on('custom-event', function(event) { alert("Custom event!") })'
[03:44:20] <B_Lizzard> And trigger it with '$(document).trigger('custom-event')'
[03:44:58] <B_Lizzard> Not exactly what you needed, but I'm guessing it's OK
[03:47:48] <andr0id1> hi guysss :D http://pastebin.com/dDWNSfFY i know i cant do what is in this pastebin, but what other way is there to achieve what i want to do?
[03:47:52] <chee> 
[03:47:56] <chee> oops
[03:49:02] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with that?
[03:49:09] <B_Lizzard> andr0id1, you can, actually
[03:49:25] <andr0id1> well, i get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[03:49:39] <B_Lizzard> Quite obviously, since it's PHP code
[03:49:57] <andr0id1> ok, so how can i resolve it?
[03:51:55] <B_Lizzard> But if you rename the file to script.php, and have the preprocessor do the job before the browser handles it as a javascript file
[03:52:00] <B_Lizzard> It will work
[03:52:04] <B_Lizzard> Hackish, for sure
[03:52:40] <andr0id1> so the file that contains this should have ext .php?
[03:53:27] <B_Lizzard> Yes
[03:53:40] <B_Lizzard> If you have PHP set up, it should work
[03:53:54] <B_Lizzard> Just like any other file
[03:53:56] <Onkeltem> I want to react when Ctrl + Shift keys are down, but in  .keydown  handler I get only current key code. How to know if both Ctrl and Shift are down?
[03:54:00] <joelbirch> or make the php into it's own php file and make it send json. Then .getJSON()
[03:54:10] <andr0id1> hahahahahha :D B_Lizzard : it works like that :D
[03:55:48] <B_Lizzard> Onkeltem, use https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys
[03:55:59] <B_Lizzard> andr0id1, yeah :D
[03:56:42] <Onkeltem> B_Lizzard: nice! htanks
[03:58:12] <B_Lizzard> ;)
[04:10:53] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/mukf4wUY this doesnt work if i dont put " before and " after the php block
[04:13:51] <Cork> andr0id1: i would recomend to use json_encode and just store your value in an array and then echo that
[04:13:55] <xiaoneng101> account add jabber daniel.fulton@chat.facebook.com MnBj59cX
[04:14:54] <mindis|wurk> anyone know why textareas scrollheight isn't updated to match changes in font size?
[04:16:43] <andr0id1> i just get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < , even though the script has php extension
[04:16:58] <B_Lizzard> Check the resulting code, could be a typo
[04:17:10] <Cork> andr0id1: do you have a link?
[04:17:27] <Cork> andr0id1: check the generated html and it should be farly obvius what fails
[04:17:32] <Cork> *fairly
[04:20:40] <andr0id1> it was a typo :D
[04:33:35] <woozly> guys, how to make <a> color fade in fade out?
[04:33:39] <woozly> on mouse hover
[04:40:08] <innociv> Okay. I have something making no sense at all.  console.log(account,  account.settings, account.settings.expand ); returns "Object { settings={...}, users=[0], ignores=[0], more...} Object {} undefined" in firebug.  Why does it show settings in account, but it comes up empty with account.settings.
[04:43:30] <fredl> hi folks.
[04:44:00] <juha_> innociv: how about account.settings.settings?
[04:44:24] <innociv> undefined
[04:44:26] <fredl> I'm working on http://politicap.eu/tasks/
[04:44:59] <juha_> innociv: oh wait, i did not notice the first account there, nevermind
[04:45:07] <fredl> So I have these buttons that have id="button-<number>"
[04:45:51] <innociv> attr('id').split('-')[1] I'm guessing is what you want.
[04:45:56] <Cork> inimino: what deos Object.keys(account) show?
[04:46:01] <Cork> *does
[04:46:07] <Cork> *innociv:
[04:46:17] <fredl> is there a way such that I can make something like $('#button-<number>').dialog() that gets the <number> into the javascript?
[04:46:22] <innociv> Cork, settings is in there
[04:46:33] <andy638> anyone therE?
[04:46:41] <Cork> fredl: $('#button-' + num)
[04:46:42] <juha_> fredl: $("#button-" + number).dialog()
[04:46:47] <innociv> account.settings in console is showing what I expect.
[04:46:57] <fredl> oh cool, thanks guys
[04:46:58] <Cork> innociv: my point is, it might be a space in it or something
[04:47:14] <andy638> what is a JSONP wrapper?
[04:47:26] <Cork> andy638: json sent as javascript
[04:47:49] <andy638> iam looking at this page http://www.virtualzone.de/2012-04-07/cross-domain-ajax-requests-embedding-content-from-another-domain-via-javascript-jquery-and-jsonp/
[04:48:07] <andy638> at the end says you need a JSONP wrapper for delivering the content that is to be embedded
[04:48:09] <andy638> what the heck
[04:48:17] <Cork> a function
[04:48:29] <andy638> so what do i put in there
[04:48:35] <andy638> how many lines
[04:48:39] <Cork> the function declares the json as return from a function
[04:49:29] <juha_> andy638: here's an example http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jsonp-safe/
[04:49:36] <fredl> hmm Cork, Juha_ that doesn't seem to work.
[04:49:56] <Cork> ?doen't owrk
[04:49:58] <Cork> ?doen't work
[04:50:16] <Cork> fredl: you need to provide more info
[04:50:23] <Cork> doesn't work is pointless
[04:50:27] <edusys> I have strA = "aabb"; and strB = "aabb - some text"; is there a way to compare strA and strB and get true ?
[04:50:35] <Lucky--> does jquery have a built in loading spinner?
[04:50:41] <juha_> fredl: put something up on jsfiddle
[04:50:45] <Doxin> edusys: compare subsets?
[04:50:50] <Lucky--> or the twitter bootstrap
[04:50:55] <fredl> what is jsfiddle?
[04:51:05] <innociv> Looks like it might just be an issue with async stuff
[04:51:06] <innociv> Ugh
[04:51:23] <juha_> fredl: http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:51:24] <andy638> on which domain does the php sit on the source or destination
[04:51:48] <Cork> andr0id1: the php is the side that provides the jsonp
[04:52:02] <Cork> the side that consumes is pure javascript
[04:52:03] <edusys> Doxin: thank you, I´ll try that :)
[04:53:46] <andy638> what do you mean provides?
[04:54:06] <fredl> Cork: I have $('#button-' + number).dialog(); two buttons with ID's button-1 and button-2, when I load the page I expect a dialog to popup, it does not do that.
[04:54:23] <Cork> andy638: the server that has the data
[04:54:47] <fredl> Cork: see http://politicap.eu/tasks/
[04:54:49] <Cork> fredl: you mean a button for each one?
[04:54:51] <andy638> both have servers
[04:54:53] <Cork> *dialog
[04:54:54] <andy638> and data
[04:54:58] <fredl> Cork - yes.
[04:55:12] <Cork> fredl: then you would have to run the command for each id
[04:55:14] <Cork> or use a class
[04:55:35] <Cork> (i recommend the class)
[04:55:56] <fredl> Well I would like to somehow pass the number to the dialog when clicked on.
[04:56:03] <Cork> ....
[04:56:14] <Cork> fredl: you have div's in your head >_>
[04:56:19] <andy638> does it go on the source or distination
[04:56:22] <andy638> the php file
[04:56:22] <Cork> with the same id too >_<
[04:56:43] <Cork> andy638: destination?? what are you talking about?
[04:57:07] <andy638> where do i put the php file
[04:57:09] <fredl> hmm
[04:57:27] <andy638> the page that is the source and is being embedded or the page i will look at
[04:57:33] <Cork> andy638: on the server that provides the data
[04:57:36] <fredl> I'm afraid I dont understand what you're saying Cork.
[04:57:54] <Cork> fredl: <div id="fb-root"></div> <-- these are in your head
[04:57:56] <Cork> twice
[04:57:57] <andy638> so the source?
[04:58:07] <andy638> the source is sending data
[04:58:17] <Cork> a server is always the source if that what you mean
[04:58:28] <malvin> i have problem with this
[04:58:29] <malvin> http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/17/
[04:58:36] <andy638> no
[04:58:39] <andy638> both are servers
[04:58:44] <Cork> uh...
[04:58:54] <Cork> ok, if your pulling json server side, you don't need jsonp
[04:59:05] <Cork> just fetch the json
[04:59:13] <andy638> iam trying to embefdd a html into another page using jsnop
[04:59:17] <Cork> its only if you want to access it from client side you need to bother with jsonp
[04:59:28] <fredl> I removed those Cork, tnx.
[04:59:29] <Doxin> could someone explain to me what jsonp is?
[04:59:31] <malvin> my insertafter() to move sku to product its move to every product instead on 1 of product
[04:59:47] <malvin> i hope someone can help me
[05:00:04] <fredl> Cork, that has nothing to do with the buttons though, right?
[05:00:10] <malvin> so sku only move on 1 product , not on 2 product
[05:00:12] <Cork> nothing
[05:00:19] <Cork> fredl: just html errors
[05:00:32] <fredl> well site is under development :)
[05:00:50] <Cork> fredl: you could fix class="formbutton" type="submit" class="formbutton" when your at it ;)
[05:00:51] <fredl> quite new to this facebook stuff.
[05:01:42] <Cork> fredl: but wheres your javascript?
[05:01:43] <Cork> can't find it
[05:02:44] <andy638> hey Cork anychance you can give me the code to complete that example
[05:02:46] <andy638> i first sent
[05:02:54] <andy638> i will be forever gratefull
[05:03:12] <fredl> uhm, ^f for dialog ?
[05:03:57] <Cork> andy638: the consept is simple, the page calls the server and the server responds with jsonp
[05:04:16] <fredl> ohwait...
[05:04:16] <Cork> the jsonp is the function name jquery requests returned as a text/javascript type
[05:04:30] <andy638> concept is simple but you need to be a programmer
[05:04:32] <andy638> :)
[05:04:56] <Cork> to create programs you need to be a programmer yes
[05:05:04] <fredl> Cork, sorry had to be logged in for that page and forgot I was logged in :P
[05:05:12] <fredl> Cork, should be able to reload
[05:06:01] <malvin> reposting http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/17/
[05:06:01] <Cork> fredl: 1. add a class to the two buttons, ex class="claim"
[05:06:11] <Cork> fredl: then do $('.claim').dialog()
[05:06:27] <andy638> so is that a no for completing the example
[05:06:32] <bobbytek2> Can I tell jquery to $.serializeArray on disabled elements?
[05:06:37] <Cork> fredl: though that will convert the buttons to dialogs, are you sure thats what you want?
[05:07:19] <Lucky--> very very cool: http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#page
[05:07:38] <fredl> nope that's not what I want :) Every task has a unique ID, it is now in the ID#. When somebody click on the button I want a dialog to open which knows the ID#
[05:08:37] <fredl> so the dialog should be autoOpen: false, that much I know, but it should open on a click on the button
[05:08:40] <Cork> fredl: but the id your using is a <button> element
[05:09:05] <Cork> and it runs on dom ready, not on click
[05:10:34] <malvin> reposting http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/17/
[05:11:32] <andy638> god i have no idea how to do this
[05:11:39] <andy638> i thought using an iframe alternative would be easy
[05:11:51] <andy638> jsnop is insanely hard
[05:11:54] <fredl> Cork, ah... really really rusty here.
[05:12:34] <Cork> fredl: can you point me to what group of elements should make up the dialog content?
[05:14:23] <fredl> Cork, that's not yet in the code. In fact I'm thinking I might make the button click an Ajax script instead after I just turned it into an onclick
[05:15:02] <fredl> dunno what I was thinking to make it a dialog.
[05:15:03] <Cork> fredl: your better of to not use inline event handlers
[05:16:34] <malvin> reposting http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/17/
[05:16:41] <Cork> fredl: you could do something like $('#content').on('click', '.claim', function(event) { $('#popup').load('url', function() { $('#popup').dialog(); } });
[05:16:50] <Cork> fredl: in your ready event listner
[05:17:04] <Cork> fredl: and on dialog close clean up the #popup element
[05:17:29] <andy638> i was looking at the wrong example
[05:17:43] <andy638> whats the easiest way to use a jsnop interaction instead of an ifram
[05:17:46] <andy638> to embed a page
[05:20:23] <fredl> hmm
[05:20:41] <fredl> I'm going to have to rethink this a little first, thanks Cork
[05:20:50] <Cork> np
[05:21:28] <fredl> a simple ajax call onclick that sets the status to 'In Progress' seems the simplest solution
[05:22:26] <Cork> inline events is often nice when you first implement it "quick fix", but it has a tendency to bite you later
[05:29:20] <malvin> reposting http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/17/
[05:29:43] <malvin> can someone help me please ? just new on jquery
[05:30:22] <Cork> malvin: whats the problem?
[05:32:13] <malvin> my sku is moved on 2 places, instead on 1 product
[05:32:23] <malvin> sku for product 1 its move to product 2 too
[05:33:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/18/ ?
[05:34:01] <malvin> no
[05:34:06] <malvin> sku: ALPURPLE is for color purple
[05:34:20] <malvin> right now is appears on color blue too
[05:34:46] <Cork> you never do any destiction between the to
[05:35:03] <malvin> mean ?
[05:35:19] <Cork> that i'm not sure what your trying to do
[05:35:27] <malvin> let me explain
[05:35:33] <malvin> 1. i have 2 product
[05:35:51] <malvin> 2. there have product option, every product option have sku
[05:36:29] <malvin> 3. right now i want sku move after product option name
[05:36:49] <malvin> 4. i already can do it, but the issue is, its do twice
[05:36:52] <malvin> so for example
[05:37:13] <malvin> color : blue have sku : alblue , color purple have sku : alpurple
[05:38:17] <Cork> malvin: and what should be used to position the sku elements?
[05:38:27] <Cork> ah, wait i think i see what it is
[05:38:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/20/
[05:38:53] <Cork> i catched one, but not both :)
[05:39:39] <malvin> so here is what i want of result
[05:39:40] <malvin> http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/22/
[05:39:53] <andy638> u still there cork?
[05:39:57] <Cork> Malediction: check the link
[05:40:08] <Cork> andy638: yes
[05:40:12] <Cork> as you see
[05:40:35] <andy638> do you know anypage that gives you step by step alternative for iframe
[05:41:19] <Cork> andy638: if you want to fully render a page from another domain, theres only two options, iframe or proxying through your own server
[05:41:37] <andy638> yeah so is there any step by step webpage showing me how to do that
[05:41:42] <Cork> andy638: the site you want data from would need to implement it for any other solution
[05:41:48] <Cork> donno
[05:41:51] <Cork> never looked for it
[05:42:00] <andy638> ive been looking for 2 days
[05:42:49] <malvin> thanks Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/20/ ithink this correct. let me try on my page

[06:08:06] <Chris_CC> Hi guys .. brand new to jquery and have a quick question, I have 2 drop down menus within a form, and i want the 2nd drop down content to change based on what is selected in the 1st drop down menu, anyone know a tutorial on this (info is in mysql tables)
[06:20:48] <christo_m> Hello, i have multiple Day views of different Fullcalendars on a page, and i have next and prev buttons that fire off to fetch the next or prev day respectively for each fullcalendar, however this proves to lag just a bit and id like to put an ajax loading icon
[06:21:23] <christo_m> im actually calling $('mycal').fullCalendar('next'); for example, and i have no way of dictating when thats complete do i? unless i look at the code
[06:22:38] <schoppenhauer> hello. when using $.getJSON(...), the data-part is encoded strangely (I thought it was encoded as json). Is there a default way to get back the structure sent as data, via PHP? The best would be to actually send it as json so I could use json_decode, but as this is not done by default, is there another default way?
[06:23:56] <schoppenhauer> I currently use a jQuery-plugin for encoding the data part into a json-string, but this is not the default way, obviously.
[06:32:37] <edusys> Hello, I have $(document).ready(function () { setInterval(function () { $("#gridServices").find("a.t-icon.t-refresh").trigger('click'); }, 30000); });
[06:32:55] <edusys> How can I disable that and then enable again?
[06:33:16] <mystiiq> how can I disable multiple keystrokes while key is pressed down?
[06:33:51] <edusys> because when I enter in a popup window, the popup is closed when the click is triggered, I want to disable when I load the popup and enable when I close it

[06:48:05] <incognit0> Can someone explain to me the need that caused jQueryUI DatePicker to give IDs to my inputs such as:   dp1338212631717 ?
[06:48:20] <incognit0> I find this profoundly annoying...
[06:54:48] <joelbirch> incognit0 why is it annoying?
[06:55:03] <joelbirch> it is - I just want to know where the pain points are
[06:55:44] <incognit0> joelbirch: Because it's entirely useless and not needed. Why are we manipulating an input's ID?
[06:56:08] <joelbirch> they probably use it to position the picker
[06:56:48] <incognit0> joelbirch: That sounds somewhat reasonable...
[06:56:57] <joelbirch> although, I don't understand why they would need it, either
[06:56:58] <incognit0> I still have some dobuts here.
[06:57:01] <joelbirch> me too
[06:57:19] <incognit0> Has this always been around in UI?
[06:57:30] <joelbirch> not sure
[06:57:36] <joelbirch> wouldn't be surprised
[06:57:45] <incognit0> le sigh...
[06:58:37] <incognit0> Okay, thanks joelbirch. At least I know I'm not the only one who thinks this is absurd.
[06:58:55] <sekyms> 427
[06:59:21] <sekyms> times i have tried to connect with no success
[06:59:21] <sekyms> hrm
[06:59:25] <joelbirch> date pickers are so configurable that maybe it is better to store each one's settings in an object and use the ID as a reference back to those settings
[07:02:06] <mystiiq> how can I get "4" out of <div id="four">4</div> - $("#four").?
[07:02:50] <schoppenhauer> *push* when using $.getJSON(...), the data-part is encoded strangely (I thought it was encoded as json). Is there a default way to get back the structure sent as data, via PHP? The best would be to actually send it as json so I could use json_decode, but as this is not done by default, is there another default way?
[07:03:12] <sekyms> $("#four").html("");
[07:03:12] <mystiiq> $("#four").text() works
[07:17:01] <Vainoharhainen> What is the correctly way to build up an table in jquery and give best performance. In vanilla i use createElement but im not sure whats the correct way to go with jQuery. two examples here http://pastebin.com/9F82ReqU
[07:18:11] <sekyms> Vainoharhainen: I do it with a variable
[07:18:17] <sekyms> then append the variable a the end
[07:18:20] <sekyms> might be faster
[07:18:28] <joelbirch> Vainoharhainen looks like a job for a templating plugin
[07:18:49] <sekyms> yeah i was going to say that next
[07:18:51] <sekyms> buuuuut
[07:18:57] <sekyms> you should probably use templates
[07:19:25] <sekyms> Vainoharhainen: http://mustache.github.com/
[07:20:07] <Vainoharhainen> Okey, any example of a template plugin? But to specify my question litle more. Whats the correct way in jQuery to create a html elements?
[07:22:01] <sekyms> Table are trickier than use elements
[07:22:10] <sekyms> because you are probably looping to create them
[07:22:19] <sekyms> for normal html append or html work fine
[07:22:31] <Vainoharhainen> loops are no problem ?
[07:22:45] <Vainoharhainen> working fine with vanilla js so why should it not work with jq :P
[07:22:59] <sekyms> loops aren't a problem
[07:23:03] <wodemay> if i have an <img> in my dom, what formats can i obtain the data of the image itself in?  is there any possible way to get a base64 representation of it?
[07:23:17] <sekyms> i told you how i do it
[07:24:12] <joelbirch> wodemay I think canvas can do that
[07:25:18] <wodemay> joelbirch, any idea how?
[07:26:34] <sekyms> wodemay: this may help: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/advanced/html5-canvas-get-image-data-tutorial/
[07:28:27] <wodemay> sekyms, thank you much, sir.
[07:41:29] <Azra-el> hey guys ... any suggestions on how to achieve something like this https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14321413/screenshot/20120528143942689.png ??
[07:44:15] <joelbirch> set the height to 0, then, on tab click, .slideDown() the menu
[07:45:56] <Azra-el> right... on click i kinda thought u would do that.. but any way to actually have to drag it down? (touch enabled devices only) with 1 to 1 movement ... something like user grabs it .. startsdragging it down.. and if when release its more then half the size of the menu just animate it out
[07:47:18] <joelbirch> sounds cool
[07:47:19] <schoppenhauer> *push* when using $.getJSON(...), the data-part is encoded strangely (I thought it was encoded as json). Is there a default way to get back the structure sent as data, via PHP? The best would be to actually send it as json so I could use json_decode, but as this is not done by default, is there another default way?
[07:47:43] <joelbirch> not sure how though. Look at a touch events library/plugin for jQuery
[07:48:38] <joelbirch> schoppenhauer what do you mean "encoded strangely"?
[07:49:30] <Kaseano> this article just blew my mind.  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12231/Memory-Leakage-in-Internet-Explorer-revisited basically if I don't order my event and appends correctly, the page will permanently leak memory until the browser window is closed?
[07:50:16] <Azra-el> joelbirch any recomandation of such a plugin by any chance? or a menu done like this maybe?
[07:50:43] <joelbirch> not off the top of my head
[07:51:14] <Azra-el> i am having a tough time figuring out what to google :) dont know how to name the effect lol
[07:51:50] <joelbirch> I just started with: jquery touch events
[07:52:19] <joelbirch> add "drag" to that
[07:52:51] <joelbirch> jquery touch events draggable menu
[07:53:10] <joelbirch> http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/touchslider/
[07:54:55] <joelbirch> this looks good if you are using jquery UI: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[07:55:15] <Azra-el> using zepto but it should be the same
[07:59:07] <joelbirch> http://labs.kojo.com.au/flickable-zepto-plugin/
[07:59:20] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: {c: ["a", "b"]} becomes something like c[0]=a&c[1]=b
[07:59:47] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: of course, I can access this via $_GET or $_POST, but this is not very convenient.
[08:00:57] <joelbirch> schoppenhauer: so it sends back a string?
[08:01:12] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: what do you mean by "it"?
[08:01:26] <joelbirch> php
[08:01:30] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: I currently set the "data"-part to $.toJSON(...)
[08:01:40] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: yes, a string.
[08:01:56] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: but as I may want to pass small lists, that is ... not very good.
[08:02:12] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: the main problem I have with $.toJSON is, that this needs a plugin
[08:02:26] <joelbirch> right, that's why I can't find it in the docs
[08:02:51] <joelbirch> surely you can get PHP to send it back as something better than a string
[08:03:14] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: well, I can access it via $_GET["c[1]"] (probably).
[08:03:23] <schoppenhauer> and $_GET["c[0]"]
[08:04:06] <joelbirch> I'm confused. Which way are you sending this data?
[08:04:42] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: $.getJSON, or $.ajax, $.getJSON is just shorthand for some special $.ajax call sais the documentation
[08:04:53] <joelbirch> yep
[08:05:09] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[08:05:10] <joelbirch> which way are you sending the data? To the server or to the browser?
[08:05:23] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: i send the data to the server
[08:05:30] <joelbirch> ah
[08:05:32] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: so my script can handle it
[08:05:36] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: and answer by json
[08:05:46] <joelbirch> so getJSON is for receiving data, I though
[08:05:51] <joelbirch> thought
[08:06:10] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: yes, but of course, sending data is always necessary.
[08:06:27] <joelbirch> of course, but you won't use getJSON for that part
[08:06:37] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: what then?
[08:06:49] <joelbirch> I see what you mean now
[08:07:17] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: what I am doing now is, that I use $.toJSON on what I would normally pass to the data-argument of $.ajax
[08:07:20] <joelbirch> so, yeah, $.ajax of some type, and send the data in a way that is good for PHP
[08:08:07] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: yes, I use $.ajax, with json-datatype. but it still encodes its "data"-field in the way I mentioned.
[08:08:18] <joelbirch> something here help? http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=serialize
[08:09:18] <joelbirch> sounds like what you don't want is a serialised representation of the data, right?
[08:09:20] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: no, this is exactly what I do _not_ want
[08:09:25] <joelbirch> right
[08:09:27] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: yes, right, I do not want it
[08:09:39] <joelbirch> I'm not sure there IS another option
[08:09:51] <joelbirch> or these serialize functions wouldn't exist
[08:10:08] <joelbirch> the query string is how POST works
[08:10:39] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: ok. well, I currently use https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/ but i would like to use no plugin.
[08:11:25] <joelbirch> sounds like you should be thinking of using PHP to turn the serialised data back into a PHP array
[08:12:08] <joelbirch> so, do it server side and don't use any jQuery plugins
[08:13:59] <shoky> the dataType setting is for what the server sends back, not what is sent to the server
[08:15:32] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch, shoky: I do not care about the actual format that is sent to the server, I just want some php function to parse it in such a way that I get a similar structure as I sent
[08:16:54] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch, shoky: so I would be fully satisfied with the current format, if I could use it in a way like I can use json.
[08:17:58] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch, shoky: can I somehow tell $.ajax to encode the data sent to the server via, say, XML, instead of url parameters?
[08:19:52] <joelbirch> sounds like you want to send a string that looks like json, which I doubt you can without a plugin. Still think there should be a way of letting it be sent in the normal way and converting it to the structure you want via PHP
[08:19:53] <Azra-el> btw... how can i debug touchstart and other touch events on my machine?
[08:21:04] <joelbirch> Azra-el good question. I had some success with Adobe Shadow. Can get a Webkit Inspector to pop up on your desktop computer that is hooked up to your iPad/Pod/etc
[08:21:43] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: any idea for search terms?
[08:21:51] <Azra-el> such a pita...
[08:22:00] <schoppenhauer> i love pita.
[08:22:10] <Azra-el> this aint the good kind of pita
[08:22:11] <joelbirch> I started with: php JSON_decode
[08:22:27] <joelbirch> that's not what you want, but those results suggest better terms
[08:22:40] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: json_decode works with json only.
[08:23:09] <joelbirch> yup
[08:26:04] <Gorkyman> hey guys... are there any special functions for window pushstate?
[08:26:10] <schoppenhauer> joelbirch: maybe I should stay with jquery-json ...
[08:26:27] <joelbirch> yeah maybe
[08:27:08] <brian_petersen> I have a webpage with a bunch of li's across the screen and I was wondering if it is possible to get the li's to move across the screen to there position when the div container around them gets to small. right now they just jump there but I want an animation;.
[08:29:00] <Krinke-away> PHP has json_encode as well (for the response)
[08:29:15] <Krinke-away> but yeah, to send data as json you need JSON.stringify
[08:29:27] <Krinke-away> but that's not in all browsers yet
[08:29:34] <Krinke-away> jquery-json plugin fixes that
[08:29:42] <Krinke-away> (and it uses JSON.stringify if available)
[08:30:12] <Krinke-away> https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[08:30:24] <schoppenhauer> https://www.zulius.com/how-to/send-multidimensional-arrays-php-with-jquery-ajax/ sais that php does it automatically.
[08:30:48] <Krinke-away> If you use an object in ajax{ data:, then jquery will url encode it with $.param
[08:31:03] <Krinke-away> which php will decode naturally into $_POST or $_GET
[08:31:13] <Krinke-away> And yes it supports multi-dimensional as well
[08:31:24] <schoppenhauer> ok, I did not know that.
[08:32:07] <Krinke-away> schoppenhauer: Be sure to verify how it behaves with numbers though, if relevant
[08:32:11] <sviatovigt> I have a var that contains a cloned element
[08:32:18] <Krinke-away> foo=2 might become a string "2" because in the url there is no diference
[08:32:28] <sviatovigt> var content = $("#listing-companies tr:last-child").clone();
[08:32:30] <Krinke-away> Test it and try it :)
[08:32:39] <sviatovigt> and a loop that iterates 15 times
[08:32:56] <sviatovigt> in that loop I want to print the variable content 15 time
[08:33:11] <sviatovigt> but it will only be printed on the page 1 time
[08:33:30] <sviatovigt> does anyone knows what I should check?
[08:33:41] <shoky> well you only cloned it once..
[08:33:47] <joelbirch> sviatovigt: clone the variable in the loop
[08:34:29] <sviatovigt> thank you
[08:34:59] <sviatovigt> what I don't understand is what really happens
[08:35:39] <schoppenhauer> Krinke-away, joelbirch: thank you!
[08:35:51] <sviatovigt> because the cloned elements are stored in the var content
[08:37:07] <bartmax> how is the best way to get an element in jsplain object which met certain condition like : jsObject.find( id == 32)
[08:37:21] <Gorkyman> is there anything new for hashchange than http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/?
[08:38:27] <shoky> sviatovigt: putting an element in the DOM doesn't automatically clone it
[08:39:20] <shoky> if it was already in the DOM then it will be removed from its first location unless you cloned it
[08:40:27] <shoky> sviatovigt: see http://jsfiddle.net/hLgqA/  for example
[08:41:22] <shoky> bartmax: what?
[08:41:34] <bartmax> nm :D i think i should use grep with first at the end
[08:41:45] <shoky> ya grep
[08:42:02] <shoky> not an element, then ;p
[08:42:25] <bartmax> shoky: nope, not dom
[08:42:34] <shoky> u lied ;(
[08:42:55] <bartmax> did i ?
[08:43:28] <shoky> ye
[08:43:34] <shoky> but nvm foo
[08:44:11] <rahmen> Hi! I'm trying to create a plugin that changes the background image of an element. So all I do is $(this).css({background: 'url(/gfx/bg.png)'}); But I want the root folder to be where my js-file is. Otherwise it might won't find the image. How do I achieve this?
[08:44:59] <shoky> the path will be relative to your document, i believe
[08:45:01] <christo_m> Hello, im trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox , but because the code to do it is being loaded via ajax, i suspect the same "input" object is instantiated as per the _create constructor, yeliding js errors like input.data("autocomplete") is undefined
[08:47:10] <rahmen> shoky: the path is relative to the html file - not the js file. I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4848518/change-background-image-url But I also want to be able to change src paths on img elements - which gives me the same problem.
[08:48:17] <rahmen> shoky: oh, maybe I don't need that. I was thinking gifs don't work as background but they do :)
[08:48:39] <shoky> huh ;P
[08:48:41] <johnline> <li><a href="#video">Walkthrough</a></li>   is there a way i can target this line for a click event?     ..  $('li a#video').click()
[08:48:41] <rahmen> so a css should be good enough to make my file-paths relative
[08:49:32] <shoky> johnline: $('li a[href="#video"]')
[08:49:41] <_ramok> hi
[08:49:57] <johnline> thanks v much shoky
[08:49:59] <_ramok> is there a simple solution for detecting the autoheight for an iframe, when i want to display an html email in an iframe?
[08:50:20] <shoky> o_O
[08:50:48] <_ramok> shoky: did i explained it wrong?
[08:51:14] <shoky> not sure. i just didnt understand what the html email has to do with the issue ;P
[08:51:39] <shoky> donno what an autoheight is
[08:52:20] <_ramok> shoky: by default, and iframe needs an height, right?
[08:52:31] <shoky> i suppose
[08:52:35] <_ramok> and i don't know the height of the content that should be displayed in the iframe
[08:52:40] <shoky> im no iframe pro ;p
[08:52:48] <_ramok> now i need to get the height of the content and add this to the iframe
[08:53:32] <shoky> add?
[08:54:40] <_ramok> yes, tell the iframe that it should get the height of the content
[08:54:41] <joelbirch> _ramok there is no simple way of doing that, I believe
[08:54:47] <ngharo> $(iframe.document).height()
[08:55:00] <joelbirch> or I could be instantly proven wrong
[08:56:09] <christo_m> Hello, im trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox , but because the code to do it is being loaded via ajax, i suspect the same "input" object is instantiated as per the _create constructor, yeliding js errors like input.data("autocomplete") is undefined
[08:56:17] <christo_m> any fix ?
[08:57:20] <Kingsy> anyone know why some jquery calls like catching events etc are dead after ajax requests?
[09:00:19] <Kingsy> it seems almost random, some html elements have trigger events other don't
[09:00:31] <_ramok> joelbirch: how is gmail doing it?
[09:00:42] <_ramok> they are not using iframes for displaying mails
[09:00:47] <Kingsy> whatever I will just do it 2morrow
[09:04:20] <shoky> christo_m: whatcha mean?
[09:04:41] <christo_m> im just scrapping it
[09:04:43] <christo_m> because the codes shit
[09:04:51] <christo_m> i know what happens, i have dialogs that are ajax loaded
[09:04:55] <christo_m> and its reloading that script they have
[09:04:59] <christo_m> that makes the combobox.
[09:05:26] <shoky> ;S
[09:06:19] <christo_m> shoky: wat
[09:06:24] <christo_m> did you look at the link
[09:06:27] <christo_m> they worte some shit there
[09:06:35] <christo_m> if i ajax load the page that has that script
[09:06:41] <rahmen> I'm writing a jquery plugin and I want to add pretty much html code into the target. It is for initialization purpose. How do I do this in a nice way? I could do it in a 1-liner: $(this).html('<div class="foo"></div><div class="bar"></div>'); but is difficult to read and edit. Any ideas?
[09:06:42] <christo_m> it works on firs ttry, if i load something else then go back to it, its broken
[09:09:38] <shoky> christo_m: not sure what you mean by: the same "input" object is instantiated
[09:11:13] <Noeble> question: how can I catch the #<something> in the url field with jquery?
[09:11:33] <christo_m> well shoky , if you look at the code
[09:11:36] <christo_m> theres something called input
[09:11:38] <christo_m> i showed the error
[09:11:42] <christo_m> Hello, im trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox , but because the code to do it is being loaded via ajax, i suspect the same "input" object is instantiated as per the _create constructor, yeliding js errors like input.data("autocomplete") is undefined
[09:12:12] <shoky> why would it be undefined if its the same input object
[09:13:55] <incognit0> Has jQueryUI slider always been glitchy when providing a step?
[09:13:56] <shoky> anyway if you post a jsfiddle that'd get you some help
[09:14:14] <shoky> incognit0: glitchy?
[09:14:33] <incognit0> shoky: I move it below 30, it becomes 30, I move it back to 30, it becomes 0.
[09:14:52] <incognit0> shoky: I can never get back to the min value, I can never get to the max value.
[09:17:12] <shoky> donno what you mean
[09:23:05] <incognit0> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/BDG/2mxuJ/
[09:23:08] <incognit0> Make it goto 0.
[09:24:12] <shoky> ok: http://jsfiddle.net/2mxuJ/3/
[09:24:40] <shoky> or you can use the 'change' event instead
[09:25:19] <incognit0> shoky: So you're saying ui.value and the options value are never the same?
[09:25:30] <shoky> depends when you're checking the options value
[09:25:41] <incognit0> Why does this even exist as a getter? :(
[09:25:55] <shoky> because you're not always in the context of an event
[09:25:58] <shoky> on the slider
[09:26:18] <incognit0> When would it be useful to get by options?
[09:26:40] <shoky> if you just wanna get the slider value.. lets say when i click some other button..
[09:28:27] <shoky> incognit0: look here : http://jsfiddle.net/2mxuJ/4/
[09:28:45] <shoky> your original one, just changed 'slide' to 'change' event
[09:29:05] <shoky> here ui.value and the options would be the same
[09:31:47] <incognit0> Right, but if I'm sliding I always have to pass a value somehow rather than call it... I don't understand why that value ends up being two different things.
[09:50:46] <shoky> the docs state very simply:
[09:50:46] <shoky> This event is triggered on every mouse move during slide. Use ui.value (single-handled sliders) to obtain the value of the current handle, $(..).slider('value', index) to get another handles' value.
[09:50:52] <shoky> (on the 'slide' event)
[09:52:19] <johnline> i need to trigger an event when something becomes visible in tabs
[09:52:47] <johnline> i tried .click() but it must be laggy, only triggers on the 2nd click of it
[09:53:22] <shoky> you can use the 'select' event
[09:53:37] <shoky> or the 'show' event
[09:53:56] <shoky> (ui-tabs events)
[09:54:31] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/include/video-test.php heres my poopie
[10:20:42] <DeltaHeavy> I have a situation that's just like this: http://jsfiddle.net/TVA3E/ except I can't get the value, however I can output $('#'+n).attr('id'), alright. Anybody know what might be causing this?
[10:21:44] <incognit0> Can someone suggest a way I can listen for changes made to an element, excluding calls made from a few functions that are intended to change it?
[10:21:50] <DeltaHeavy> $(this).val() works though...$('#'+n) should do the same though.
[10:22:46] <Acrack1> hello, i have a double "backdrop in" in twitter bootstrap when i trigger a modal
[10:23:00] <Acrack1> anyone had the same problem ? or know from where it come from
[10:23:01] <Acrack1> ?
[10:24:34] <DeltaHeavy> Why would $(this).val() work but 'var n = $(this).attr('id');$('#'+n).val()' not?
[10:25:52] <Rovanion> Do you have any favourite way of horizontally scrolling the content of a div with overflow: hidden?
[10:27:31] <DeltaHeavy> I'm beginning to think this is actually a bug with jQuery. Anybody else seen this kind of stuff?
[10:28:17] <_cS_LP2> rovan.. go look at the code of some carosels that have that functionality
[10:30:44] <thomedy> i have an off topic question with an on topic point so please bare with me
[10:30:49] <thomedy> first off is anyone here
[10:31:23] <DeltaHeavy> I am lol
[10:31:43] <thomedy> have you ever seen home movies the cartoon
[10:32:31] <DeltaHeavy> Nope
[10:33:23] <thomedy> nm i am looking for a way to do a revolving animation of 3 hand sketches i have to make
[10:33:26] <tw2113> this room is nothing but bots
[10:33:32] <thomedy> is there a way to do that with js
[10:33:37] <bradbrad> Guys Im lost! Been trying to do this http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/2010/05/how-to-ajaxify-wordpress-theme.html but only get as far as this http://vertexcentral.com/christelle2 what could i be doing wrong???
[10:34:14] <tw2113> for anyone who's going to argue that bradbrad's question is a WP issue, he's already been sent to more ajax/js focused rooms FROM #wordpress
[10:34:21] <tw2113> so sending him back would be fruitless for him
[10:34:34] <DeltaHeavy> thomedy: Not sure what you mean by revolving animation
[10:34:49] <bradbrad> tw2113 thanks! haha
[10:35:26] <tw2113> granted i trust people in here comprehend the difference in problems better than #css
[10:36:13] <bradbrad> had to try everywhere! haha
[10:36:30] <tw2113> don't forget your code pastebin
[10:37:07] <thomedy> i got an answer somewhere else but i really appreciate it
[10:37:49] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why I'm getting a value with $(this).val() but not 'var n = $(this).attr('id');$('#'+n).val();'?
[10:38:46] <bradbrad> heres the pastebin http://pastebin.com/RGdFj98v

[11:53:28] <Lucky--> I need a fresh pair of eyes. Can someone help me spot the css that is making my validation errors invisible? I just spent an hour trying to debug to realize it was working, just not visible.

[11:54:21] <wodemaye__> What all can there be in terms of external page supporting resources barring flash/silverlight/things-that-run-priveleged-code-natively/etc?  Am I missing anything that could possible trigger an extra HTTP verb beyond the original root document request? | Images, Javascripts, JSON/XML data files that might be fetched by javascripts, Iframes, Stylesheets, (now i suppose audios and videos...)  Am I missing anything else?

[11:59:52] <yedimind> im at that caliber, but no way would i move to indiana :)
[12:00:03] <bdiu> Bloomington, Indiana is like Austin Texas
[12:00:06] <bdiu> great great great place
[12:00:20] <yedimind> as a canadian, id be hard pressed to live ANYWHERE in the states
[12:00:21] <bdiu> (better than austin imho)
[12:00:22] <bdiu> ahh
[12:00:25] <bdiu> i get that
[12:00:25] <bdiu> hehe
[12:00:34] <yedimind> :)
[12:00:36] <yedimind> nothing personal
[12:00:37] <bdiu> silly canook
[12:00:43] <bdiu> ;-)
[12:00:45] <yedimind> i just like my free healthcare and social services
[12:00:55] <yedimind> and being able to smoke a joint without 3 consecutive life sentences
[12:01:23] <bdiu> but where is the fun in smoking a J without the risk... heh

[12:01:52] * bdiu wishes US politicians would stop being so conservative and start working towards a better society
[12:02:01] <bdiu> just my 2cents
[12:03:22] <yedimind> anyway, im good enough that you guys should just uproot and move your office to toronto
[12:03:23] <yedimind> :)
[12:03:56] <yedimind> not that i need a new job
[12:04:22] <bdiu> We might be moving our dev operations to Santa Monica, CA
[12:04:25] <bdiu> but...
[12:04:29] <bdiu> can't say we'll change countries
[12:04:31] <bdiu> :-)
[12:04:40] <bdiu> I'm not 100% sold on relocating myself
[12:05:48] <shoky> so. how hard is it to find a job in the US or in canada, with say 70-80% of time. (i.e. not full time)?
[12:06:07] <shoky> with 10+ years of exp in front-end & back-end
[12:06:22] <bdiu> just depends on the type of work you ant to do and the pay you'd expect
[12:06:22] <bdiu> heh
[12:06:37] <bdiu> tons of jobs out there doing wordpress sites
[12:06:45] <shoky> i guess my question is. is it much harder finding a non-full-time job
[12:06:47] <yedimind> shoky, depends on how good you are
[12:06:54] <yedimind> i have ~15 years of experience and am super senior
[12:07:00] <yedimind> so i have job offers all the time, like on a weekly basis
[12:07:08] <yedimind> and have never had to look for a job in my life
[12:07:14] <shoky> i'm pretty good i think, at dev. not at being a manager or leading a team
[12:07:40] <yedimind> oh but you wouldnt do full time ?
[12:07:42] <phidev> yedimind but my dad is stronger than your dad.
[12:07:51] <shoky> i'd rather not, that's the issue yes
[12:07:52] <yedimind> phidev, my two moms will kick your dad's ass
[12:08:23] * phidev .oO
[12:08:38] <yedimind> im just kidding
[12:09:23] <phidev> Too late. I'm already imagining some parent orgy going on there. :(
[12:09:33] <shoky> eek
[12:10:00] <phidev> :}
[12:10:44] <bdiu> lol
[12:11:31] <bdiu> New deal... if anyone refers me a person that I hire, I'll buy them an iPad as a finders fee (or other crap android tablet if they insist)
[12:11:33] <bdiu> :-)
[12:12:17] <yedimind> most of the guys i know wouldnt bother looking for new placement if it was less than $150k/year
[12:13:19] <eip56> Lol bdiu what are you hiring for
[12:13:27] <bdiu> http://rideamigoscorp.com/content/jobs
[12:13:52] <bdiu> yedimind: I doubt I'll pay that much, but if the person is worth it, it's not 100% out of the question
[12:14:18] <bdiu> but for that amount, I'd probably expect John Resig to be applying
[12:14:52] <yedimind> heh, guys like that make 200-250k +
[12:15:10] <yedimind> i make ~120-150 right now, and you've never heard of me
[12:16:18] <innociv> You make that much coding javascript?  Who for?
[12:16:33] <bdiu> yedimind: yeah, that's true
[12:16:44] <shoky> i'd prolly settle for much less :\ though i'm probably not familiar enough with US/canadian cost of living vs. here
[12:17:18] <eip56> live comfortably need around 100k
[12:17:32] <eip56> gives you a family and a few kids with out having to struggle
[12:17:46] <shoky> i dont need a family and a few kids right now ;)
[12:18:00] <eip56> ok you only need 50k then
[12:18:02] <eip56> ;-p
[12:18:05] <shoky> awesome ;p
[12:18:23] <shoky> i suppose i make the equivalent of around 60-70k right now
[12:18:57] <shoky> and im in a small company thats known to be cheap
[12:19:08] <shoky> but i stay coz i can work as much as i want
[12:19:09] <NoiseEee> i get paid in comic books and pot brownies
[12:19:17] <bdiu> NoiseEee: sign me up!
[12:19:50] <Mac_Weber> how to get the index of a table's cell?  tdObject.cellIndex only gives its index referent to the roll, not to the entire table
[12:22:32] <risky> how do you have a fixed nav using a css framework ?
[12:22:46] <eip56> Mac_Weber are you talking about its indexed value in reference to the whole table ie: 0-9 the row is 3 -index
[12:23:02] <eip56> risky whats wrong with the nav
[12:23:03] <risky> i seems my div wont float next to my nav if have position:fixed
[12:23:19] <eip56> Link?
[12:23:26] <risky> its not live yet
[12:23:38] <Mac_Weber> eip56: yes
[12:23:38] <antnash> Hey guys. I'm trying to highlight and unhighlight a <select> when it's focussed, and I'm blurring it on change. How do I blur it if the option isn't changed?
[12:25:01] <motka> how to create a jquery plugin?
[12:25:11] <eip56> lol so many questions today
[12:25:12] <motka> need tips and guidelines
[12:25:17] <yedimind> innociv, i do more than just coding, im a technical experience director - im in charge of the front end team
[12:25:21] <dabear> ?lmgtfy
[12:25:21] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[12:25:39] <eip56> Ok risky problem with your box model. Does the item need to be fixed?
[12:25:43] <dabear> ?lmgtfy how to create jquery plugin @ motka
[12:25:44] <bot-t> motka, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+create+jquery+plugin
[12:25:45] <motka> google it for me, dabear
[12:25:55] <motka> if I had found some quite good solutions
[12:25:59] <motka> I would be asking advices here
[12:26:05] <motka> but thank you anyways
[12:26:14] <dabear> is there anything specifically you wanna know then?
[12:26:32] <motka> what is the best pattern
[12:26:38] <motka> I've seen lastnight on #javascript
[12:26:38] <dabear> because google is full of great solution telling you how to create a plugin
[12:26:43] <motka> someguy sad that i'ts possible to
[12:26:51] <motka> $.myplugin = function() {}
[12:26:52] <motka> true/false?
[12:27:04] <risky> my webpage is a single page with jquery scrolling, now my nav needs to be fixed so when a user clicks a page he doesnt have to scroll to the top to scroll to another page, I am using the 960 framework and have just now tried the 1140 framework however it seems to have the same effect
[12:27:05] <dabear> you can do that
[12:27:23] <shoky> motka: (function($) { $.fn.myPlugin = function() { ... } } )(jQuery)    is the common pattern
[12:27:53] <shoky> though it depends how you want to use your plugin
[12:27:53] <risky> the main div wont float next to the nav if i have position:fixed on my nac
[12:27:54] <eip56> motka go with shoky's setup its the most common
[12:27:56] <risky> nav*
[12:28:00] <eip56> he beat me in typign it
[12:28:08] <eip56> typing*
[12:28:50] <eip56> post code risky. Its hard to say. Maybe a float problem and/or put live so we can see
[12:29:08] <innociv> Ah
[12:29:10] <eip56> did you float: left;?
[12:29:44] <eip56> Mac_Weber does the row have a css class or id or would it be defined by data
[12:29:44] <risky> i am using a css framework, shall I just post the code for the html?
[12:30:07] <innociv> Because position fixed and absolute remove it from the pages flow
[12:30:12] <innociv> the float is probably putting it underneath
[12:30:25] <Mac_Weber> eip56: there is a div in that row with an unique class
[12:30:26] <eip56> Risky the HTML wont help us its a css issue.
[12:30:41] <Mac_Weber> in that cell*, I mean
[12:31:00] <eip56> are you trying to get at that div or are you trying to style the row
[12:34:01] <risky> heres the code - http://jsfiddle.net/kAGtA/
[12:36:25] <dapingwing> hey, how do i make sure a IRC connection stays even when clicking a link ? so that on the next page the irc is there again and still conencted !
[12:38:27] <yedimind> dapingwing, use a real irc client, not a webbased one?
[12:39:59] <dapingwing> i know , but i want it for my users ...
[12:40:14] <risky> any help on this problemo ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/kAGtA/
[12:41:00] <antnash> Hey. How do I get the <select> to blur even if the option isn't changed? -> http://jsfiddle.net/nashant/GKA47/1/
[12:50:05] <eip56> Ok risk Im looking at the code
[12:50:13] <eip56> you want the divs to float left right
[12:56:08] <Mac_Weber> if I have a 3x3 table, with a div with id=find-me in the 5th cell, how to get the index 5?
[13:00:10] <eip56> Mac_Weber What are you trying to accomplish with that index? what will you do with it?
[13:00:17] <shoky> rowIndex*3 + cellIndex ?
[13:01:15] <shoky> +-
[13:02:00] <dabear> antnash: don't think there is an event for that
[13:04:10] <wodemaye__> can i have single quoted values in my $.ajax(..) options?  eg, type: 'GET' as opposed to "GET"?
[13:04:52] <NoiseEee> sure
[13:05:38] <dabear> wodemaye__: sure, why not
[13:06:24] <wodemaye__> because they're json literals, aren't they? the json.org spec is specific in that strings need to be enclosed by double. quotes.
[13:06:26] <aFeijo> hey guys, how can I get the index of a given <tr> ? if I find an ID among my table, I need to figure out in which index (eq) it is
[13:06:27] <dabear> you can't however, have single quotes in a json string. but that isn't a problem here, as you're just calling a function to retrieve something
[13:06:47] <spanglesontoast> anyone able to figure out what i'm doing wrong :S http://jsfiddle.net/9Hgsg/5/
[13:06:51] <wodemaye__> dabear, does that make sense?
[13:07:00] <Dr-Bombay> antnash: you will have to also handle clicks on the select element and pray that different browsers do not send the events in a different order
[13:07:23] <shoky> spanglesontoast: lots of things
[13:07:27] <dabear> wodemaye__: no it does not. you are calling a function. the returned value from the server must be properly formed
[13:07:48] <dabear> how you call it, is unrelated to the json spec
[13:08:07] <wodemaye__> but the json i pass into the function for options doesn't need to be well formed?  and it won't break between browsers?
[13:08:10] <spanglesontoast> shoky: care to share ?
[13:08:25] <shoky> spanglesontoast: first of all, i dont even know what your issue is..
[13:08:37] <shoky> spanglesontoast: 2nd of all you have PHP in your HTML
[13:08:43] <antnash> Dr-Bombay: Yeah, it's not looking particularly hopeful.
[13:08:50] <dapingwing> hey, how do i make sure a IRC connection stays even when clicking a link ? so that on the next page the irc is there again and still conencted !
[13:09:05] <shoky> spanglesontoast: 3rd $(#theLink.id)  is incorrect. maybe you meant $('#' + theLink.id)
[13:09:27] <dabear> wodemaye__: if you are using the data property, it is converted to correct format for you
[13:09:33] <dabear> see ?ajax
[13:09:40] <dabear> Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs
[13:10:30] <shoky> dapingwing: middle-click the link? or right-click->open in new tab?
[13:10:42] <shoky> dapingwing: or use a non browser-based client
[13:10:54] <shoky> or a better browser, etc
[13:11:24] <shoky> or maybe you;'re asking about an IRC connection in your app??
[13:11:52] <yedimind> didnt i already answer that
[13:11:52] <dapingwing> in my app
[13:11:59] <dapingwing> i need another solution
[13:12:00] <shoky> ah
[13:12:04] <yedimind> target=_blank ?
[13:12:06] <yedimind> on the anchors
[13:12:12] <dapingwing> cant i pass it ?
[13:12:36] <yedimind> every message thats going in/out im sure you can parse and add that to any anchor
[13:12:40] <yedimind> to make sure it opens up in a new tab/window
[13:13:07] <dapingwing> yeah but i mean cant i like pass the irc connection on
[13:13:14] <shoky> ;S
[13:13:14] <wodemaye__> dabear, i'm not talking about the data property... I'm talking about others. like type.
[13:13:15] <dapingwing> or any alternatives to irc?
[13:13:28] <wodemaye__> is type: 'GET' just as valid as type: "GET"?
[13:13:40] <dabear> wodemaye__: YES, THAT IS NOT JSON
[13:13:48] <shoky> ;D
[13:14:14] <dabear> it is a property of an object passed to a javascript function
[13:14:16] <wodemaye__> dabear, OKAY, SORRY! ;)
[13:14:57] <wodemaye__> for HTML5, do I need <![CDATA... for my <script> tags?
[13:15:18] <shoky> O_O
[13:15:25] <dabear> wodemaye__: would you think that this is valid? var bar = {"type": 'MY MOM'} ?
[13:15:37] <yedimind> you havent needed <![CDATA for at least 5 years now
[13:15:47] <dabear> then also foo( {"type": 'MY MOM'}) is valid
[13:16:02] <Dr-Bombay> antnash: http://jsfiddle.net/GKA47/8/  (you will also have to check for the enter key but this is the concept)
[13:16:16] <dabear> or $.ajax(url, {"type": 'GET'}))
[13:16:33] <wodemaye__> yedimind, ...on any browser?
[13:17:05] <wodemaye__> dabear, yeah, that makes sense.  thanks buddy. :)
[13:17:16] <yedimind> you only ever needed cdata if you were trying to parse an xhtml document as xml
[13:17:32] <yedimind> which IE never supported, people just started using it because they saw someone else do it
[13:18:10] <shoky> Dr-Bombay: toggling the highlight on click doesn't work too great either :\
[13:19:20] <wodemaye__> oh i see, dabear... json is only for object transmission/interchange, but the $.ajax function takes an object literal.
[13:19:42] <dabear> correct
[13:19:51] <yedimind> wodemaye__, furthermore, you only needed to escape < and & in XML-served xhtml, which is what cdata was used for (to escape those)
[13:19:55] <yedimind> but yeah
[13:20:35] <antnash> Dr-Bombay: I think I'll just forget it. I was looking at adding a click event handler only when the focus event fires, and then removing it once it was blurred, but not looking great
[13:20:58] <shoky> Dr-Bombay: nvm what i said
[13:21:34] <wodemaye__> yedimind, thanks. :)
[13:21:42] <yedimind> <3
[13:23:54] <Dr-Bombay> antnash: I think you can make it work
[13:24:07] <Dr-Bombay> based on what I gave you
[13:24:14] <NoiseEee> antnash: whats the point of blurring it / why?
[13:25:14] <Dr-Bombay> antnash: I also considered temporarily registering a click handler, but realized that I really just needed two variables to track the state
[13:25:33] <Kingsy> anyone know of a slider that supports dynamic resizing of the images? basically, I want a slider that will go full screen, so you give it an image larger than the screen size.. and you can simply set a height and with on the img tag and it just slides that rather than the full size images
[13:25:38] <Kingsy> nivo slider doesnt do it
[13:26:04] <antnash> NoiseEee: You can see it in action if you go to qi.anthonynash.com
[13:26:36] <NoiseEee> antnash: what about it?
[13:28:43] <antnash> NoiseEee: The point of blurring it is to remove the highlighting, so that if it's clicked again it can be rehighlighted.
[13:29:21] <Dr-Bombay> oh shit it got desynchronized
[13:29:28] <Dr-Bombay> oh well it worked for a few seconds :-P
[13:29:33] <antnash> Dr-Bombay: That would also require accounting for every method of changing the option
[13:29:43] <antnash> Yeah, I managed to desync it
[13:30:11] <Dr-Bombay> oh that's right it was desynchronized because I tested the enter key
[13:30:17] <Dr-Bombay> so add a handler for the enter key, no big deal
[13:30:23] <antnash> if you use alt down/up, too
[13:32:11] <Dr-Bombay> well, the open state of the control and the focus state are different. You can't really change that part
[13:32:42] <antnash> Yeah. Which is why I think I'll just sack it off.
[13:32:50] <antnash> It's fine how it is really
[13:38:52] <GabrielR> hur, .click(function(){})     isn't working on IE 7 and 8 but works is all other browser including ie9.  I have it on a DIV tag so I suspect IE doesn't support click events on div int he older version?   Any idea what's going on?
[13:39:22] <GabrielR> Google search returns a lot of random speculation for answers, but no solid reason or list of items click() will work on
[13:45:36] <mllie> hello
[13:47:03] <Husel> Hello! Anyone know any jquery tutorials regarding posting to a database?
[13:47:52] <Dr-Bombay> what database
[13:48:06] <mllie> is it possible to animate an element from one container to another?
[13:48:12] <nFFF> Husel, thats not how it works :>
[13:48:26] <nFFF> You post to a script server side, that will insert the data into a db
[13:48:38] <Husel> Can't I specify a php script which returns html for the page?
[13:49:03] <Dr-Bombay> that doesn't answer my question. what kind of database do you want to post to.
[13:49:11] <NoiseEee> Husel: $.ajax({url:'location.php',type:'post',data:{key:val}});  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:49:33] <GabrielR> damn, it looks like ie9 running in ie8 or ie7 compatibility mode doesn't throw js console errors.  RAG
[13:49:36] <GabrielR> RAGGEEE
[13:49:46] <Husel> Dr-Bombay, I'm not sure what you mean by what kind?
[13:50:06] <NoiseEee> Dr-Bombay: ?
[13:50:14] <_BigWings_> can someone tell me why the first query returns a div, while the second returns nothing?
[13:50:23] <_BigWings_> http://www.pasteall.org/32365
[13:50:27] <Dr-Bombay> husel: if you don't know what kind of database you have to post to, then that's something you need to figure out
[13:50:53] <Husel> Just a normal database on my server. :s
[13:51:03] <NoiseEee> _BigWings_: $([id^="remark"]) iirc;
[13:51:04] <Dr-Bombay> husel: ok, on the server, that's a start
[13:51:09] <yedimind> Husel, mysql?
[13:51:15] <Husel> yedimind: yeah
[13:51:23] <yedimind> that's the answer he was looking for
[13:51:25] <Dr-Bombay> husel: allowing a web page to post data directly into a server database is a wrong thing
[13:51:43] <NoiseEee> i think he's really asking how to post a form with XHR/ajax.
[13:51:47] <NoiseEee> the DB talk is irrelevant
[13:51:51] <yedimind> Husel, the general idea is that you would have PHP that does that for you, but then you can use XHR/Ajax requests to hit up those php scripts
[13:51:56] <yedimind> without the page refreshing
[13:52:09] <Husel> I have the php scripts :)
[13:52:23] <NoiseEee> Husel: $.ajax({url:'location.php',type:'post',data:{key:val}});  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:52:42] <dapingwing> how to put al children of a element in a new div ?
[13:52:49] <_BigWings_> NoiseEee: thanks!
[13:53:11] <Husel> NoiseEee: Do I need to use javascript to extract the form information to put into there?
[13:53:22] <Husel> It would be nice to be able to connect it up to a form or something
[13:53:38] <nFFF> ?appendTo @ dapingwing

[13:54:45] <Lucky--> how much of a performance boost would u guys say minifying all the css/js u have gives you?
[13:55:18] <nFFF> Lucky--, depends how many lines of code
[13:55:37] <nFFF> youll probably see more performance boosts combining all files
[13:55:43] <nFFF> css sprites, js , css etc
[13:55:54] <nFFF> the fewer requests to the server the beter
[13:58:38] <Lucky--> nFFF: good to know, thx! I had my files seperated into like 6-7 simply due to readability and coding best practices.
[14:00:23] <nFFF> Yea you should combine them for sure
[14:00:42] <mllie> is it possible to animate an element from one container to another?
[14:02:13] <Lucky--> nFFF: that and combining them and minning em will make it a biatch to steal my code
[14:02:50] <nFFF> Do you think anyone would actually steal your code? :D
[14:03:07] <Lucky--> lol possibly, im in the marketing/lead gen world.
[14:03:27] <Lucky--> and i'm the "techy" that everyone always copies because they cant do it themselves

[14:31:41] <btiernay__> anyone using ajax chosen and having race condition issues?
[14:32:16] <NoiseEee> when i hear "ajax" and "race condition", it suggests someone not understanding how to use callbacks / async programming
[14:32:19] <NoiseEee> and on that note, goodnight
[14:35:33] <ryanaz> anyone here good with jqueryuI ?
[14:35:49] <dub54> hi, I've got 5 questions with say 3 answers for each question, so 3 x <input type="radio" name="question-1" />, 3 x <input- type="radio" name="question-2" /> etc.. what's the easiest way to check that each unique input name has been checked?
[14:35:56] <dub54> so essentially a question can't not have an answer
[14:36:10] <dub54> do I have to just write a few loops, or is there a better way?
[14:41:04] <nFFF> $('input').not(':checked')
[14:43:40] <b_52globe> hi guys plz i got the following json object and i want to remove all the element execept the element that got <entity_id>16  and 17 plz how achieve that ?
[14:44:14] <wodemaye__> syntactically, what's wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/nameofjsfact/ZBKv8/2/ ?
[14:45:33] <nFFF> ?set
[14:45:44] <nFFF> what is $.set() ?
[14:46:25] <nFFF> surely youll have to escape some of that string
[14:48:06] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!! :-))))
[14:50:28] <Gorkyman> anyone using History.js ?
[14:51:19] <nFFF> Gorkyman, not personally
[14:51:24] <nFFF> Ive seen bbq suggested more
[14:51:26] <nFFF> ?bbq
[14:51:27] <Lurzino> having an <input type="select" ... /> is there a way to filter options list while typing some letters?...
[14:52:03] <nFFF> Gorkyman http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[14:52:19] <Gorkyman> nFFF: more? why?
[14:52:48] <nFFF> Perhaps becuase benalman is part of the jQuery team so his plugin gets preference
[14:53:07] <nFFF> history.js is probably just as good
[14:54:19] <wodemaye__> what's history.js?
[14:54:47] <Gorkyman> nFFF: bbq is quite old...
[14:55:02] <nFFF> just a plugin for pushstate + ajax + hashtags iirc
[14:57:46] <nFFF> Gorkyman, Im not sure that means anything, as it does what its suppose to
[14:57:57] <nFFF> I dont think youll particularly have any issues, with either plugin
[14:58:07] <nFFF> Ive seen them both mentioned in here multiple times
[14:59:23] <wodemaye__> nFFF, oh right, i have to use .attr('attrname', 'attrval');, right?
[14:59:52] <nFFF> wodemaye__, I have no idea what your trying to do
[15:00:02] <nFFF> but $.set() isn't a native jquery method
[15:00:30] <nFFF> and your massive long string of javascript will need properly escaping
[15:01:52] <Gorkyman> Tom,
[15:02:03] <TomWij> Yes?
[15:03:31] <wodemaye__> are you sure, nFFF? wouldn't it be interpreted as a string literal since it's enclosed ini  "s?
[15:06:42] <wodemaye__> trying to create an iframe with the hidden attribute, then set its srcdoc attribute to that long multiline string, then append it to the document body
[15:06:58] <fredl> :q
[15:07:04] <fredl> oops
[15:07:36] <wodemaye__> nFFF, what else is wrong if i correct set() to attr()?
[15:10:26] <FrEaKmAn_>  hi all.. i just need some help.. im using this script http://pastie.org/3985200.. how could i change line 98 so that I also pass parameter element?
[15:10:31] <FrEaKmAn_> so that i would have someFunction(xhr, status, error, element)?
[15:13:11] <nFFF> wodemaye__, theres something wrong with that string literal
[15:13:23] <innociv> Do windows have some sort of unique identifier that I can tell them apart by?
[15:13:29] <nFFF> I think it needs breaking up to have on multi lines
[15:13:48] <nFFF> like: var x = "line1"+
[15:13:50] <innociv> Or should I just set new Date().getTime()?
[15:13:52] <nFFF> "line2"
[15:13:55] <nFFF> etc
[15:14:17] <nFFF> or you need to escape your new lines properly

[15:37:47] <gaius65> Hey guys!
[15:37:59] <gaius65> I have a very strange behavior, is that purposefully?
[15:38:14] <shoky> yes
[15:38:56] <gaius65> shoky: sry, accidentally already posted, here's the question
[15:38:58] <Lurzino> having an <input type="select" ... /> is there a way to filter options list while typing some letters?...
[15:39:11] <gaius65> $('#lala').slideUp(500, callback); triggers the callback once, but $('#lala').add('('#lala').slideUp(500, callback); triggers the callback twice
[15:39:34] <gaius65> … $('#lala').add('('#lala2').slideUp(500, callback);
[15:39:47] <shoky> Lurzino: what's an <input type="select"> ?
[15:40:05] <shoky> Lurzino: you probably mean an autocomplete widget..
[15:40:36] <shoky> gaius65: the code you just pasted seems broken...
[15:40:45] <shoky> extra quote
[15:41:18] <shoky> gaius65: and you still haven't asked your question
[15:41:58] <gaius65> shoky: Why is $('#lala').add('#lala2').slideUp(500, callback); triggering the callback twice? How can I change it to only once?
[15:42:20] <shoky> umm because you're animating two elements?
[15:43:05] <Lurzino> shoky, type=select it's an input which will be shown as a dropdown combo
[15:44:01] <shoky> gaius65: you can do:  $('#lala').add('#lala2').slideUp(500).promise().done(callback)  i think
[15:44:07] <gaius65> shoky: yes… is there  different query method which would combine the two selectors?
[15:44:38] <shoky> gaius65:  $('#lala,#lala2') ?
[15:44:39] <gaius65> (When I do $('#lala,#lala2').slideUp(500,callback) I also only get one callback triggering
[15:44:55] <shoky> really?
[15:46:20] <gaius65> shoky: I just said what you said (you just where a bit faster)… so yes, really!
[15:46:44] <shoky> huh no you didnt
[15:46:48] <shoky> you said you only get one callback
[15:46:49] <gaius65> shoky: Is there a way I can combine two jQuery selections to get a similar result as $('#lala,#lala"')
[15:46:49] <shoky> trigger
[15:46:54] <shoky> but you get two with #lala,#lala2 as well
[15:47:13] <shoky> what you said about: (When I do $('#lala,#lala2').slideUp(500,callback) I also only get one callback triggering
[15:47:15] <shoky> is wrong..
[15:47:23] <shoky> it's the same behaviour as with .add()
[15:47:24] <rhino_> how can I add an onclick event to an iframe that looks like this:  <iframe id = "iframe_id" src="..\painscalecard\index.php" width="792" height="612" frameborder="1" scrolling="auto" /></iframe>
[15:47:27] <rhino_> ?
[15:48:13] <rhino_> I tried this:  $('#dvprs_front').bind('click', function(event) {
[15:48:13] <rhino_>  alert('it works');
[15:48:13] <rhino_>  }); but it does nothing
[15:49:29] <rhino_> shoky:  any ideas?
[15:50:08] <shoky> rhino_: i donno much bout iframes.. but i think the iframe has its own document
[15:50:29] <shoky> so you'd need access to jquery in there, donno
[15:50:36] <eip56> rhino i blieve .bind is depreciated
[15:50:39] <eip56> .on
[15:50:43] <eip56> would be the correct format
[15:50:49] <eip56> or .delegate
[15:50:58] <shoky> .delegate is also deprecated
[15:51:11] <shoky> ah its not sory
[15:51:15] <gaius65> shoky: oh sry, your right (I had a bad selector :-/)
[15:51:18] <rhino_> eip56:  so, how would I check the onclick event of an iframe then?
[15:51:19] <eip56> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:51:20] <shoky> but.. "superseded"
[15:51:35] <shoky> gaius65: so i told you the solution
[15:52:35] <gaius65> shoky: yes, thx!
[15:52:39] <gaius65> :)
[15:55:45] <innociv> Okay.  I have an issue.  I need to figure out if a window is focused or not.  I see there is $(window).focus() but that only triggers when it has been blurred and then is focused.  I can't simply add .load() to that, because someone could have ctrl+click to open a tab in a new window without focusing it.
[15:56:09] <innociv> I'm at a loss for the best way to handle this.
[16:02:09] <shoky> i doubt you'll find anything better than these solutions:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1060008/is-there-a-way-to-detect-if-a-browser-window-is-not-currently-active
[16:02:11] <innociv> I guess I need to listen on mousemove and stuff too..
[16:02:19] <innociv> I saw that.
[16:02:31] <innociv> like i said, focus doesn't trigger on the first focus.
[16:02:44] <innociv> Someone has to change windows then view the window again. :|
[16:02:57] <shoky> then use more than one of the methods..
[16:03:02] <antnash> Anyone know if it's possible to give one of the jquery ui dialog div buttons an id?
[16:03:04] <shoky> like one of the guys says there
[16:04:45] <innociv> I hate to trigger something on mousemove because that event is fired A LOT.
[16:04:47] <innociv> But I guess I must
[16:07:08] <innociv> Which won't work on smart phones/tablets.
[16:20:59] <eip56> rhino did you get it?
[16:21:44] <eip56> you could do and this is simple but $('iframe').on('click' function() {})
[16:25:43] <ryanaz> I'm using a dialog button for a login window, how do I submit an ajax/json request to the webserver and get a response back?
[16:25:49] <ryanaz> and validate whether or not it worked
[16:27:02] <ryanaz> thoughts?
[16:29:41] <eip56> what languages are your using html css jquery andd... php and your server side?
[16:30:04] <ryanaz> i'm doing perl on the server side.
[16:30:15] <ryanaz> css, jquery and perl..
[16:30:36] <ryanaz> I just found this page http://www.alessioatzeni.com/blog/login-box-modal-dialog-window-with-css-and-jquery/
[16:30:39] <eip56> ewwww
[16:30:49] <eip56> i have used perl in a long time but heres the gist of it
[16:31:08] <eip56> use jquery to give the use some nice info like this field should be this long
[16:31:14] <spanglesontoast> shoky: are you still alive :S ?
[16:31:32] <eip56> then use your perl side scripting to validate such as matching information for credentials
[16:31:54] <eip56> so the process would be user enters info corrects if not valide according to js
[16:32:13] <eip56> jquery then sends a ajax request to the perl script containing server side validation
[16:32:41] <eip56> then the script returns to the login via ajax saying yes your submission was a success or no you fail epically
[16:32:59] <ryanaz> eip56:  I am doing the vallidation in the button logic ...
[16:33:24] <ryanaz> eip56: so I basically just need to send the info so that when completed it goes to a different url once logged in
[16:34:27] <eip56> ok example being you need to save their name and password for the new redirected page? sorry a bit confused on what your trying to accomplishj
[16:35:40] <ryanaz> eip56:  I would imagine I would need to do a call when they push the "login" button to do an ajax query or something to the webserver... send it some info, and then it gets a response back to write, writes the cookie to the host, and then redirects to the main pge.
[16:35:51] <ryanaz> i would imagine someone has done this before?
[16:36:28] <ryanaz> it should respond back "successful... logging in" or "error, invalid username or password"
[16:37:18] <spanglesontoast> http://jsfiddle.net/9Hgsg/22/ anyone know what I'm doing wrong :S ?
[16:40:30] <dAnjou> hey folks, i want to include some color pickers into my site so that my good old parents can pick colors they like for all the elements. are there some plugins already?
[16:41:25] <eip56> ryanz that would come from your perl script
[16:41:33] <eip56> what ever script validates the user info
[16:41:35] <dAnjou> it shouldn't be heavy, there are only half a dozen elements max.
[16:41:38] <eip56> returns the message
[16:42:10] <ryanaz> eip56: right but I'm new to javascript ... what function do I call from the button to do the ajax call..
[16:42:12] <ryanaz> load () ?
[16:42:28] <shoky> spanglesontoast: yep
[16:42:58] <ryanaz> eip56: if you look at the page right now (i just updated it) .. it's doing $( this ).dialog( "close" );
[16:43:30] <ryanaz> eip56: I would imagine I need to call something and make a fucnction that sends the info, waits for the response, and then does something with the response
[16:44:06] <spanglesontoast> shoky: sorry earlier had connection problems i lost what you had said
[16:44:48] <eip56> well yea you would need to return false
[16:44:53] <eip56> so the buttons dont do anything
[16:45:09] <ryanaz> eip56: do you see what i have right now?
[16:45:19] <eip56> then depending on the button use the ..load or the more verbose .ajax to call the authenticating script
[16:45:48] <ryanaz> see were it does a   $( this ).dialog( "close" );
[16:45:52] <shoky> spanglesontoast: well you fixed what i told you to
[16:46:17] <ryanaz> instead I imagine I would call a function that handles the ajax piece and sends info, and gets the response back
[16:46:24] <ryanaz> would that be an .ajax call ?
[16:46:26] <eip56> YEa I see that
[16:46:28] <shoky> spanglesontoast:  id's cant begin with a digit.  id's need to be unique
[16:46:43] <ryanaz> like I said.. new here... i'm a perl guy, learning javascript .. first time.. (sorry)
[16:46:44] <eip56> you need to e.preventDefault on that button
[16:47:02] <ryanaz> eip56:  nah, I can remove thtat part and it won't close.
[16:47:06] <shoky> spanglesontoast: don't bind event handlers in your html (with onclick="javascript:..." ) but with jquery on DOM ready
[16:47:21] <ryanaz> eip56:  i think I just need to make a function to do the ajax piece..
[16:47:25] <ryanaz> instad of the close
[16:48:08] <eip56> welll you have to tell jquery to do something with that button when licked
[16:48:12] <eip56> clicked*
[16:48:41] <shoky> spanglesontoast: also you have a <div> inside a <tr>  wtf
[16:49:08] <shoky> spanglesontoast: you've made like.. every possible error :P
[16:50:13] <eip56> yea clean the code  bit
[16:50:15] <ryanaz> ok, so what would that "something" be ?
[16:50:31] <ryanaz> what function should I be looking at?
[16:51:36] <eip56> soooo you would need to do something along the lines of this
[16:52:17] <eip56> $('the button').on('click',function(e) {
[16:52:24] <eip56> e.preventDefault;
[16:52:46] <eip56>   // code to process user input
[16:53:16] <eip56> so basically your saying when this button is clicked preventDefault ie: dont close or go anywhere and process
[16:53:28] <ryanaz> eip56: ok, but where does the ajax query come in?
[16:53:55] <ryanaz> eip56:  it's gotta send something to the server, to get a response to write the cookie and an xml response or something to parse
[16:55:40] <ryanaz> eip56:  I think I just found the answer ... $.post
[16:55:52] <spanglesontoast> shoky: i've just tried every possible way i could think of getting it to work to be honest :S
[16:56:12] <eip56> well you could use $.post $.get .load() .ajax
[16:56:28] <eip56> is the form post or get
[16:56:40] <eip56> .load would be the easiest
[16:56:53] <eip56> .ajax would give you the most processing power
[16:57:18] <eip56> personally i stay away from .post .get i just use ajax and define the method of data transfer
[16:57:32] <ryanaz> gotcha...
[16:57:44] <ryanaz> .load replaces the results with html doesn't it?
[16:57:49] <ryanaz> so that one seems messy
[16:58:42] <eip56> .load you can replace with anything
[16:58:58] <eip56> its just a helper function all 3 of those go back to .axaj
[16:59:02] <eip56> .ajax
[17:01:22] <devOlsen> is there a way to pull up the index of gathered elements from a query in relation to the search, not the elements dom index?... with out looping over them with an each?
[17:04:22] <gnat_x> i'm working on something and having trouble getting it working. i've got a bunch of rows, which (briefly) have div#eventID div.options ( div.button, div.button). when the buttons are clicked i update something in a sqlite table, and then want to swap out those options for a different set.
[17:04:27] <devOlsen> for instance $('a').filter('.default').. I would like to know the index of .default in relation to the $('a') search, not it's dom index() and possibly do so with out needing to $.each($('a'),function(i){...}) loop the search results.
[17:04:58] <gnat_x> i've tried empty(), and detach(), neither of them seem to quite to what i want.
[17:05:41] <gnat_x> the issue is that the buttons lose their click function when replaced.
[17:07:07] <Arimil> Can someone tell me why console.log($("img#small").width());  is outputting 798 when I set the value to 800?
[17:07:11] <devOlsen> try .live('click',function(){...}) vs .click(function(){...}); gnat_x, the element will retain it's events you setup after dom changes such as ajax requests replacing the button element with a new button elements.
[17:08:02] <devOlsen> Arimil because you have padding or margins that make up the rest of the 800.
[17:08:02] <gnat_x> devOlsen: hrm. interesting, let me try.
[17:08:24] <devOlsen> try http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/ outerWidth Arimil
[17:08:36] <Arimil> devOlsen: I have margin: 0px; padding: 0px; in the css for the element
[17:09:04] <devOlsen> do you have a border on it?
[17:09:07] <devOlsen> that is 1px wide?
[17:09:19] <devOlsen> thus removing two pixels off the left and right?
[17:09:27] <Arimil> nope also put border: 0px solid;
[17:09:34] <Arimil> still outputting 798
[17:09:41] <devOlsen> no clue then.
[17:09:51] <devOlsen> in the inspector, see computed styles.
[17:09:58] <devOlsen> see if that is 798 or 800
[17:10:31] <devOlsen> no outline either?
[17:10:41] <gnat_x> i'm assuming the image itself is actually 800? (the obligitory is it plugged in question)
[17:11:51] <devOlsen> maybe it is set with a 100% width while it's parent container is 798px wide? heh
[17:12:03] <devOlsen> just throwing things out at this point.
[17:14:13] <gnat_x> devOlsen: that worked. thanks!
[17:14:20] <devOlsen> np
[17:15:33] <Arimil> devOlsen: 798
[17:15:54] <Arimil> http://pastebin.com/vbVzk4md
[17:16:03] <Arimil> it still says there's a border it looks like :\
[17:16:07] <Arimil> even though I removed it
[17:16:48] <devOlsen> do you have a link?
[17:16:58] <devOlsen> or a jsfiddle.net you could show us.
[17:17:32] <Arimil> Uh sure sec
[17:19:33] <shoky> devOlsen: you can do  $('a').index( $('a.default') )
[17:20:31] <devOlsen> thanks shoky!
[17:20:52] <shoky> ;>
[17:22:02] <devOlsen> man I knew there had to be a way to get the index of the search and not the dom elm.. stupid me for not seeing right in the api you could pass a selector to reflect the index on it's self!
[17:22:04] <devOlsen> how cool.
[17:22:21] <devOlsen> hehe was even going down into the data of the selected array.. that is a creepy place down there.
[17:22:39] <shoky> ;p
[17:23:19] <rhino_> does anyone know how to determine if an iframe has been clicked on?
[17:23:30] <rhino_> I have tried this:  $(document).ready( function() {	
[17:23:30] <rhino_> $(window.frames['#iframe_id']).click(function(event){
[17:23:30] <rhino_> alert('hello');
[17:23:30] <rhino_> });
[17:23:30] <rhino_> });
[17:23:37] <rhino_> but it does nothing
[17:24:32] <Arimil> devOlsen: http://208.111.201.145/html
[17:25:00] <devOlsen> try $(window.frames[id="iframe_id"]) rhino
[17:25:42] <devOlsen> sorry Arimil, is that a localhosted ip?
[17:25:45] <devOlsen> not able to resolve it.
[17:25:58] <Arimil> hm k
[17:26:07] <Arimil> sec
[17:27:25] <devOlsen> actully rhino_ have you just tried to query the iframes id alone? $('#iframe_id').click(function(){...});
[17:28:52] <shoky> rhino_: http://jsfiddle.net/9Hgsg/23/
[17:29:00] <rhino_> devOlsen:  just tried this:   $('#iframe_id').click(function(){alert('hello')}); in chrome, and it didn't work
[17:30:32] <rhino_> shoky:  how do I check the log?
[17:30:49] <shoky> rhino_: ctrl-shift-j / f12
[17:31:01] <shoky> or just change it to an alert :\
[17:31:07] <shoky> works with .contentDocument also
[17:33:28] <devOlsen> hmm you can't really capture the click of the iframe its self, but you can (if same domain policy compliant) can setup a click event listener on the document of the loaded iframe. http://jsfiddle.net/kfVNX/4/, I can't attach a click event to the document in this iframe because it is of a different domain etc etc.
[17:36:44] <Arimil> devOlsen: http://208.111.201.145/html
[17:36:46] <Arimil> should work now
[17:37:34] <devOlsen> Holy penguin batman, these take forever to load.
[17:37:38] <devOlsen> heh, but yes working now.
[17:38:16] <Arimil> clicking the button should put the images width in the log
[17:39:13] <rhino_> shoky:  chrome give me an uncaught Typeerror:  Cannot read property 'ContentWindow' of undefined when I put it in my code
[17:39:22] <rhino_> what would cause that?
[17:39:51] <devOlsen> Arimil.. it logs 100 and then 800 consistantly for me..
[17:39:56] <devOlsen> unable to reproduce the issue.
[17:40:06] <Arimil> devOlsen: hm, what browser?
[17:40:10] <devOlsen> chrome
[17:40:50] <Arimil> hm thanks
[17:42:48] <rhino_> devOlsen:  anyideas??^
[17:44:02] <johnkpaul> rhino_: http://jsfiddle.net/9Hgsg/24/
[17:45:28] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  it still give me the same error
[17:45:30] <shoky> rhino_:  undefined.ContentWindow could cause that..
[17:45:45] <shoky> the fiddle gives you an error?
[17:46:01] <johnkpaul> in chrome 19 osx, I am seeing no error rhino_
[17:46:29] <rhino_> shoky:  no, I copied your code and put it in mine, to basically test it out, and it gives me that error
[17:46:41] <shoky> ok so obviously you copy pasted wrong
[17:46:56] <shoky> my code didn't say ContentWindow
[17:47:03] <shoky> so. you are weird ;P
[17:47:15] <tw2113> no you
[17:47:24] <shoky> i m
[17:47:36] <rhino_> shoky, yours said 'contentWindow'
[17:47:40] <shoky> indeed
[17:48:57] <rhino_> shoky:  here is my exact code:  http://pastie.org/3985820
[17:49:16] <rhino_> I know the js call is correct
[17:49:18] <shoky> what about DOM ready handler?
[17:49:29] <shoky> oh its there sry
[17:49:37] <shoky> er no its not
[17:49:58] <johnkpaul> :)
[17:50:07] <johnkpaul> ?document.ready @ rhino_
[17:50:10] * shoky squishes jkp
[17:50:24] <johnkpaul> man, I go on a long three day weekend vacation and the bot is still gone?
[17:50:30] <shoky> on & off
[17:50:33] <shoky> mostly off
[17:50:40] <johnkpaul> :(
[17:50:43] <shoky> ;[
[17:50:59] <johnkpaul> rhino_: you need to run your code after the dom has loaded
[17:51:59] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  tnx so much
[17:52:19] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  what does the [0] do?
[17:52:21] <johnkpaul> no problem, thank shoky too
[17:52:35] <rhino_> shoky:  tnx a bnch as well
[17:52:46] <johnkpaul> rhino_: it returns the DOM element, not the jquery wrappe dobject

[18:00:02] <johnkpaul> tw2113: no bot
[18:00:08] <tw2113> booo
[18:00:10] <johnkpaul> I can pretend though
[18:00:13] <johnkpaul> tw2113: try it and see
[18:00:58] <tw2113> i just HAD to delete my xchat logs too
[18:01:43] <wodemaye__> anyone in here right now?
[18:02:31] <tw2113> just us bots
[18:03:38] <wodemaye__> sorry tw2113 my xchat was frozen for a little bit.
[18:04:55] <tw2113> happens
[18:05:44] <wodemaye__> http://jsfiddle.net/nameofjsfact/hu255/3/ <-- what's wrong with that?  it should spit up a popup telling you what country you're in...
[18:06:55] <shoky> you know that the .hide() and .attr() are in the context of $('body')  yes?
[18:07:11] <shoky> the .append() doesn't change the context
[18:07:15] <tw2113> wodemaye__ TypeError: $("body") is null
[18:07:29] <tw2113> i changed alert to console.log
[18:07:34] <wodemaye__> how the hell can $("body") be null?
[18:08:21] <shoky> oops nvm what i said.
[18:08:42] <shoky> why not put spaces in your code :\
[18:09:34] <shoky> anyway i donno what you're doing there. http://jsfiddle.net/hu255/4/
[18:10:42] <wodemaye__> ok, so geoplugin.net has a geoip API.  it uses your IP address that you request the js from as the ip to return info on...
[18:10:51] <wodemaye__> but i want to hide my referrer.
[18:11:08] <wodemaye__> my site will know the client's country, but geoplugin won't know my site.
[18:11:17] <wodemaye__> so i call it from within an iframe which obviates the referrer.
[18:12:50] <shoky> it looks like all you're doing is spitting some encoded nonsense into your iframe
[18:13:15] <wodemaye__> well paste that encoded nonsense into your address bar shoky
[18:13:41] <shoky> why?
[18:14:32] <tw2113> so i can get your credit card
[18:14:37] <wodemaye__> its not nonsense.
[18:14:42] <wodemaye__> tw2113, haha
[18:14:45] <shoky> who cares if i called it nonsense
[18:14:47] <shoky> jeez
[18:14:58] <shoky> its nonsense when it's encoded.
[18:15:14] <shoky> and this encoded nonsense is sitting in your iframe, encoded.
[18:15:21] <shoky> so, success.
[18:16:47] <wodemaye__> haha shoky http://fiddle.jshell.net/ZBKv8/show/light/ <-- try that.
[18:17:06] <wodemaye__> i just want to convert that to html5 dom syntax, and pure jquery with no hard-coded html.
[18:17:16] <shoky> what's 'light' ?
[18:17:40] <johnkpaul> shoky: jsfiddle skin
[18:17:52] <wodemaye__> whatever its the same thing just less bloated.. here: http://jsfiddle.net/ZBKv8/
[18:17:53] <shoky> wodemaye__: why 'srcdoc' and not 'src' ?
[18:18:17] <shoky> wodemaye__: http://jsfiddle.net/hu255/5/
[18:19:02] <shoky> hmm what's different about 'light'  ;S
[18:19:48] <wodemaye__> shoky, less bloated.  my computer sucks.
[18:20:06] <shoky> kz..
[18:20:08] <johnkpaul> shoky: I actually dont' know what the other options are, I just know that the default one is light
[18:20:08] <johnkpaul> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/embedding.html
[18:20:37] <shoky> oh it's the default

[18:28:25] <johnkpaul> no problem
[18:28:54] <rhino_> shoky, johnkpaul:  when I try to use the code you gave me in an include file for another page, it does nothing: http://pastie.org/3985968  btw, jquery is included in the parent page.
[18:30:18] <rhino_> does it have something w/ the vars that I am setting?
[18:30:47] <johnkpaul> rhino_: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[18:31:04] <johnkpaul> you need to add that click handler after the iframe page has been loaded
[18:31:15] <johnkpaul> in your jsfiddle example, there was no src IIRC, so it worked immediately
[18:31:58] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  so, do I just need to place the js code after the iframe?
[18:32:39] <johnkpaul> rhino_: no, did you read that link that I sent you
[18:33:32] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  ah, so I just need to add a .load before $( $('iframe')[0].contentWindow ).click(function() {   ??
[18:33:39] <javalover> hey guys so i'm converting from javascript over to jquery, hence my javascript was document.getElementById('#id');  and now my code is $("#myobj");
[18:34:07] <javalover> anyways, in my code I have this while(t.parentNode){ }   where t =  document.getElementById('mything');
[18:34:11] <johnkpaul> rhino_: did you try it?
[18:34:23] <wodemaye__> shoky, why can't i do this...? http://jsfiddle.net/hu255/7/
[18:34:34] <javalover> i'm just curious what will happen when I change that using jquery...is there a different way of writing t.parentNode?
[18:34:42] <johnkpaul> javalover: what do you mean converting from javascript to jquery? jquery _is_ javascript
[18:34:52] <shoky> wodemaye__: you just did ..?
[18:34:56] <johnkpaul> javalover: that's like saying that you're converting from apache comments to java
[18:35:09] <johnkpaul> commons*
[18:35:10] <javalover> johnkpaul   not exactly, as i originally had   var myobj = document.getElementById('#mything');
[18:35:10] <wodemaye__> shoky, why can't i successfully do it?
[18:35:18] <wodemaye__> why won't it work ..?
[18:35:22] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  I did this:  $(document).ready(function() {
[18:35:22] <rhino_> $(window).load(function () {
[18:35:22] <rhino_> $( $('iframe')[0].contentWindow ).click(function() {
[18:35:22] <rhino_>     alert('click');
[18:35:22] <rhino_> });	
[18:35:23] <rhino_> });
[18:35:25] <rhino_> });	
[18:35:26] <javalover> but now i have var myobj = $("#mything");
[18:35:28] <johnkpaul> javalover: that should not work, getElementById takes a string of id
[18:35:31] <johnkpaul> not #id
[18:35:33] <rhino_> but its still not doing anything
[18:35:38] <johnkpaul> rhino_: don't paste code into this channel
[18:35:43] <javalover> well yeah i was just trying tos how an example
[18:35:44] <rhino_> sry
[18:35:50] <johnkpaul> rhino_: why do you care when the window loads?
[18:35:55] <javalover> so it would be 'mything'
[18:36:04] <javalover> anyways point being....i then say myobj.parentNode
[18:36:09] <javalover> but will this work in a jquery obj?
[18:36:13] <shoky> no
[18:36:15] <johnkpaul> no, .parent()
[18:36:24] <rhino_> johnkpaul:  well, what should be in the load if not the page?
[18:36:25] <javalover> ok so that's proper then using .parent()?
[18:36:40] <javalover> so like while(myobj.parent()){}
[18:36:41] <johnkpaul> eh, not exactly, javalover, I dont' know what you're trying to do
[18:36:52] <javalover> i'm changing how i'm retrieving my object
[18:36:56] <wodemaye__> shoky, any idea?
[18:37:02] <johnkpaul> I'm still confused though, why are you doing this rewrite "in jquery" javalover?
[18:37:04] <javalover> from grabbing with document.getElement   to $("#myobj");
[18:37:07] <shoky> wodemaye__: i have no idea what srcdoc is
[18:37:12] <javalover> it has to do with how i'm passing variables
[18:37:24] <javalover> i have another function that i'm using jquery on & i'm passing it to an original javascript function
[18:37:36] <javalover> it's just easier to keep track of the object in jquery
[18:38:07] <johnkpaul> so if you want to get all of the ancestors of a dom element, there is $().parents()
[18:38:23] <johnkpaul> I've never seen the idiom while($el.parent()){} used, javalover
[18:38:30] <javalover> is that the equivallent to... while(t.parentNode){
[18:38:32] <wodemaye__> oh hahahah. that's what i get for reading unimplemented specs i guess. :(
[18:38:39] <javalover> so then what would one do instead?
[18:39:04] <johnkpaul> javalover: that depends on what you're trying to do, for what purpose are you iterating through parent nodes?
[18:39:17] <javalover> i'm actually going over that right now in my head as we speak about it
[18:39:23] <wodemaye__> i'm such an idiot.  it's an html attr for iframe els.
[18:39:26] <javalover> this function is just so that if you don't click on the object it hides it
[18:39:52] <rodd> What's a good way / pattern when you have to instantiate and re-instantiate a couple plugins at different moments in your app? I'm trying to keep my code clean and not throw the same piece of code all over the place. Any ideas?
[18:39:57] <javalover> perhaps their is a way of checking on not mouseclick?
[18:40:19] <rhino__> johnkpaul:  here is what I have now:  http://pastie.org/3986011  what am I still doing wrong??
[18:40:25] <javalover> I know i could just grab the mouse coordinates & then check if it's inside the object.
[18:40:36] <johnkpaul> javalover: ah, so you're checking if a click is on a particular object or any of it's ancestors?
[18:40:52] <javalover> yeah...I had grabbed this code from someone else & this is just how they did it
[18:41:20] <javalover> oh ic he does checkParent(target)
[18:41:48] <javalover> and then onmousedown = check(e) or whatever...so it passes the target to the function
[18:42:10] <javalover> then he iterates through & somehow checks to see if the target is the same...I guess then in javascript a target is the object the mouse clicks on
[18:42:22] <shoky> rhino_: why did you comment the DOM ready handler :\
[18:42:56] <johnkpaul> javalover: yes, the target property of the event object is the dom element that the event handler was attached to
[18:43:20] <johnkpaul> so you want to check if that element or any of it's ancestors are in some array of elements?
[18:43:41] <javalover> right cuz say I attach it to a div I wanna know if it's inside the div or outside it
[18:44:00] <javalover> if it's inside it I want it to return true & outside return false
[18:44:57] <rhino__> johnkpaul:  when you get a chance, can you please tell me what I'm doing wrong?  http://pastie.org/3986011
[18:45:08] <shoky> rhino_: why did you comment the DOM ready handler :\
[18:45:42] <rhino__> shoky:  just saw your comment:  I didn't know if I still needed it?
[18:45:47] <shoky> yeah.
[18:45:49] <johnkpaul> javalover: something like $(event.target).parents().andSelf() would give you an array of the element and all of it's parents
[18:46:09] <johnkpaul> then you'd need to check if anything is in the intersection
[18:46:37] <johnkpaul> rhino__: you still need it
[18:46:53] <johnkpaul> rhino__: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[18:46:59] <rhino__> shoky:  it still won't alert when clicked on though, I'm baffled, and no errors
[18:47:49] <shoky> why are you setting up click handlers for your iframe anyway :\
[18:47:55] <shoky> do it inside the iframe
[18:48:16] <johnkpaul> shoky: you don't like rube goldberg, do you
[18:48:17] <rhino__> shoky:  how do you mean?
[18:48:48] <rhino__> shoky:  I basically just need to know when the iframe is clicked on
[18:49:09] <shoky> jkp i donno, he's that dude that complex machines are named after no?
[18:49:44] <javalover> i'm trying that now johnkpaul
[18:49:44] <johnkpaul> shoky: yeah, makes it as complicated as possible to butter some toast
[18:50:07] <shoky> rhino__: i mean, set up click handling in the other page, the one that's in the iframe. NOT in the one that contains the iframe
[18:50:24] <shoky> heh
[18:50:45] <johnkpaul> javalover: ok great
[18:50:49] <shoky> did you ask that cause of what i asked rhino? :p
[18:50:59] <johnkpaul> yes, that is exactly why
[18:51:11] <johnkpaul> you just want things to be sooo easy. Just add the handlers _in_ the iframe you say
[18:51:16] <shoky> i will squish you to squishness
[18:51:17] <johnkpaul> where's your sense of adventure shoky? ;)
[18:51:23] <shoky> ;)
[18:51:46] <rhino__> johnkpaul, shoky:  I would, but the page the iframe is loading is a flash page.  It sets some js vars whenever certain items are clicked, I just need to know when the iframe is clicked so that I can run some functions on the vars that are set
[18:52:04] <shoky> it looks like a php page
[18:52:10] <shoky> what's a flash page :S:S:S
[18:52:47] <shoky> is that some HTML5 crap?!?!
[18:53:04] <shoky> (jk..)
[18:53:23] <rhino__> shoky:  Not something I coded, I'm just trying to make it work, LOL
[18:53:39] <shoky> and you only rememebered now that it has flash.
[18:53:54] <rhino__> Is what I'm trying to do even possible?
[18:54:30] <rhino__> shoky:  No, I new it had flash, but I just need to know when the iframe is clicked
[18:54:59] <shoky> you can't change the iframe's page itself?
[18:55:28] <shoky> if you knew all this time why did you hide the fact :\
[18:56:45] <rhino__> shoky:  I can edit it, but it only has html and js in it, calling a flash file
[18:57:03] <shoky> html and js is great, for like.. binding to click events and stuff
[18:57:12] <rhino__> shoky: wasn't trying to hide it
[18:57:13] <shoky> flash, i donno ;)
[18:57:17] <shoky> i know you weren't
[18:58:32] <rhino__> shoky:  here is the page the iframe is loading:  http://pastie.org/3986080
[18:58:35] <shoky> anyway just bind the click event of that whole document or window (in the html & js & flash page)
[18:58:44] <shoky> and if that doesn't work, i believe you're screwed
[19:00:23] <rhino__> shoky:  you mean use a .bind instead of a .load?
[19:05:59] <ryanaz> newbie here ... if this is my xml:  <xml><status>success</status></xml>   what does my success ajax function look like to set a variable to "success"?    ie:    .success(function(xml)) {  var status = ?????; }
[19:06:41] <species> you want to parse the XML and pick the <status> node out, right?
[19:06:45] <ryanaz> ya
[19:07:40] <wodemay> shoky, why is it outputing these weird symbols? http://jsfiddle.net/BP77W/
[19:08:43] <ryanaz> species:  I'm guessing something with:  $(xml).find...  something
[19:08:59] <wodemay> anyone know why this is getting output on that fiddle? `; }*/ });//]]>
[19:09:09] <species> yeah, im guessing its $(xml).find("status").text
[19:09:51] <species> although I would use JSON for this whole thing instead
[19:12:22] <shoky> rhino__: no i mean editing the iframe's page itself (the last one you linked to) and adding the click handler in there
[19:12:48] <ryanaz> species:  how does that work?   Right now I have it sending the request like this:             $.ajax({ url: "/api/auth.cgi", cache: false, dataType: "xml", type: "POST", data: { email: email.val(), password: password.val() }, context: document.body }).success(function(xml) { var status; }).done(function() { $(this).addClass("done");
[19:12:49] <ryanaz>  
[19:13:50] <shoky> wodemay: it works  http://jsfiddle.net/BP77W/4/
[19:14:17] <shoky> wodemay: you keep having some weird character that is screwing things up. this time it was in the commented text at the end (which i deleted)
[19:14:42] <wodemay> oh thats weird.
[19:16:30] <rhino__> shoky:  I can do this http://pastie.org/3986125  and it will alert, but the click event won't work, any ideas?
[19:18:00] <shoky> ryanaz: $(xml).find('status').text()  should work fine
[19:18:24] <ryanaz> shoky:  Thanks, i'm trying to test it...  doing an alert(status); is being weird
[19:18:35] <shoky> alert(status) ?
[19:18:52] <ryanaz> var status = $(xml).find("status").text;  alert(status);
[19:18:58] <shoky> o
[19:18:59] <ryanaz> would'nt that show an alert box with the output ?
[19:19:05] <shoky> .text() as i said
[19:20:32] <ryanaz> that's working awesome
[19:20:40] <wodemay> this is so weird!
[19:20:52] <ryanaz> so is this a normal ajax usecase?   or am I missing something here?  seems straight forward
[19:21:12] <ryanaz> working good...
[19:22:12] <ryanaz> shoky ?
[19:22:16] <shoky> if it works good, what would you be missing?
[19:22:41] <ryanaz> well, i'm going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff based on my knowledge of how this works.. i don't want to go too far down this road if it's backwards..
[19:22:57] <shoky> ryanaz: btw .success and .done are the same. .success will be removed maybe sometime tho
[19:23:07] <shoky> nah you're doing fine
[19:24:47] <wodemay> shoky, why 12 but not 13? Yes http://jsfiddle.net/BP77W/12/ No http://jsfiddle.net/BP77W/13/
[19:25:48] <shoky> wodemay:  that weird invisible character again. causing:  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[19:26:17] <wodemay> I'll bet it has to do with firefox's clipboard handling.
[19:26:27] <tga> hello
[19:36:06] <shoky> hy
[19:36:10] <xinming> In jquery, How do we get the previous event handler bound to the element please?
[19:36:33] <thinkt4nk> check .data('events')
[19:36:33] <xinming> I mean, someone have ever done something like $('a').bind('click', function (e) { ... } );
[19:36:41] <xinming> hmm, Ok, I'll try
[19:36:45] <thinkt4nk> event handlers can be inspected there
[19:43:32] <ryanaz> doesn't jquery have a sexier alert() function ?
[19:43:41] <ryanaz> is it $(alert()) ; ?
[19:43:59] <Lucky--> whats a good amazon s3 upload client that supports cloudfront?
[19:58:50] <shoky> ryanaz: jquery doesn't have alert..
[19:59:00] <ryanaz> oh ok, maybe it was just dialog
[19:59:28] <ryanaz> shoky: thanks again for your help earlier
[19:59:29] <ryanaz> it's working
[19:59:32] <ryanaz> lol
[19:59:37] <shoky> np
[20:00:19] <rosieres> with which function can I stop sliceing at a certain sign ? In this case im checking for a location hash and sometimes I add a parameter starting with a "?" how can I stop the slicing there ? http://jsfiddle.net/ZtDFm/
[20:02:29] <shoky> rosieres: you can use .indexOf to get the index of a character in your string
[20:02:57] <rosieres> shoky: k ill try .. thanks
[20:07:10] <tocka> hey guys, just wanted to ask, if an image isnt loaded (shows not default not loaded image icon) is it possible to add a another image?
[20:07:27] <tocka> i mean like in explorer, when the image is not found there is a red X
[20:10:02] <carpii> try $('img').error(function() { …
[20:10:37] <tocka> thanks:)
[20:10:48] <tocka> I was wondering maybe it could be done in css :o
[20:11:26] <carpii> hop, since the css class of an image is the same even before the image has loaded
[20:11:30] <carpii> hop = nop
[20:11:42] <carpii> you could use query to assign a new css class to broken images tho
[20:12:17] <carpii> but typically Id say you'd want to remove the image node from the dom, and then insert a div or something
[20:24:04] <imsky> herp
[20:26:07] <devOlsen> Nice! made a lightweight tab plugin http://jsfiddle.net/cn8LK/1/, can set the default opened tab based on window hash, inline class or index number when calling the plugin (priority respected in that order).
[20:31:37] <rhino__> do onclicks always execute before $().clicks ??
[20:33:43] <imsky> no nevar
[20:40:09] <rosieres> shoky: I dont get it together with the indexOf() . . . could you help me out . . .   I wrote some stuff in the fiddle to understand it better . . .  http://jsfiddle.net/ZtDFm/4/
[20:46:32] <ilriso> How can I increment a variable each time I hover an element?
[20:50:17] <tga> ilriso: you bind a handler to the hover event and do whatever you want in it
[20:50:49] <tga> ilriso: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[20:50:58] <ilriso> tga: Ok, sounds good to me, ill give it a try right now, thanks!
[20:51:06] <tga> good luck
[20:53:46] <ryanaz> in javascript how do you compare two strings ( ie.  perl would be   if ($string1 ne $string2) { ... }
[20:54:12] <Cork> ryanaz: if(string1 === string2) {}
[20:54:21] <ryanaz> Cork:  What about !=== ?
[20:54:36] <ryanaz> if !(string1 === string2) { }
[20:54:37] <ryanaz> ?
[20:54:46] <Cork> === just means that it doesn't try to convert the data type
[20:54:50] <Cork> !== does the same
[20:54:54] <Cork> its not specific to strings
[20:55:06] <Cork> == and != will work too
[20:55:12] <ryanaz> != doesn't seem to be working
[20:55:27] <Cork> ?eval "me" != "he"
[20:55:27] <caniuse> Cork: true
[20:55:32] <Cork> ?eval "me" != "me"
[20:55:32] <caniuse> Cork: false
[20:55:47] <Cork> ?eval "me1" != "me"
[20:55:47] <caniuse> Cork: true
[20:55:54] <Cork> ?eval "1" != 1
[20:55:54] <caniuse> Cork: false
[20:55:57] <Cork> ?eval "1" !== 1
[20:55:57] <caniuse> Cork: true
[20:56:22] <ryanaz> ?eval "me" != "you"
[20:56:22] <caniuse> ryanaz: true
[20:56:33] <ryanaz> ?eval "me" != "me"
[20:56:33] <caniuse> ryanaz: false
[20:56:35] <ryanaz> huh
[20:57:21] <ryanaz> What am I doing wrong?  I can't seem to get the eval for email & emailverify to match  https://beta.stratfuel.com/main.cgi?page=register_front
[20:59:03] <Cork> your comparing dom elememts
[20:59:16] <Cork> or even worse jquery selected dom elements
[20:59:23] <ryanaz> and?
[20:59:32] <Cork> email.val() !== emailverify.val()
[20:59:51] <ryanaz> oh oh oh
[20:59:53] <ryanaz> right.......
[21:00:05] <ryanaz> i've got 2 days of javascript/ajax/jquery so far...
[21:00:28] <ryanaz> i'm a perl hacker taking this on... i'm really really loving jquery/javascript so far.
[21:00:39] <ryanaz> seems to make sense the further and further I get with it
[21:00:42] <Cork> ya, its nice
[21:01:24] <ryanaz> i'm slowly converting my entire site over from the mentality of form/submits cgi/parsing / spitting out the results over to javascript/ajax/jquery ... wow.. pretty cool stuff
[21:02:08] <Cork> don't forget that you should still have validation on the server side
[21:02:36] <ryanaz> right.... cause people could see the code and try to inject stuff through the json stuff...
[21:02:53] <Cork> or they could not use js
[21:03:05] <Cork> or use another tool like curl or something
[21:03:14] <ryanaz> right.. just attack the cgi
[21:04:21] <ryanaz> cork: that seems to be the most complicated part is verifying that the data the user is submitting or asking for is really what they should be submitting or asking for..
[21:04:37] <Cork> yup
[21:04:59] <ryanaz> cork: I would imagine a lot of people who spent a lot of time in the front end gui end up making assumptions that the data coming in is solid..
[21:05:06] <dannielly> hello. i'm using the widget factory to build a plugin. where's the proper place to put static methods?
[21:05:26] <Cork> dannielly: static?
[21:05:50] <Cork> javascript doesn't really have static methods
[21:05:58] <Cork> its either internal or public
[21:11:32] <dannielly> cork: more like global methods... that operate on the plugin as a whole, not each instance
[21:12:19] <Cork> dannielly: you don't have that in the factory
[21:12:45] <dannielly> where can i attach my own then?
[21:12:46] <Cork> dannielly: all function are added to the prototype, but... just don't refer to "this" and it should work fine
[21:13:45] <dannielly> ideally it would be called like "$.pluginName.method()"
[21:13:59] <dannielly> or "$.namespace.pluginName.method()"
[21:14:17] <Cork> jquery widgetfactory doesn't work like that
[21:14:31] <Cork> your functions ends up in pluginName('method')
[21:15:18] <dannielly> but if i wanted to do it myself, is $.myPlugin.method() or $.namespace.myPlugin.method() the place to put it?
[21:15:45] <dannielly> method being a function that operates on all instances of the plugin on the page
[21:15:45] <nathanw478> hello
[21:16:36] <Cork> dannielly: you could modify $.fn.pluginName.prototype
[21:16:49] <Cork> but be carefull when you fiddle there, or you might break widgetfactory
[21:16:54] <diverdude> If i have a jquery-node stored in variable A, and another in B, is there some way i can do something like B.append('<li><span>some text</span>'+A+'</li'); ? I mean, append A inside B at specific point.
[21:17:02] <dannielly> yeah that's what i was worried about
[21:17:30] <Cork> dannielly: opps sorry thats the wrong place
[21:17:45] <Cork> dannielly: its $.pluginName
[21:17:58] <Cork> and it should not exist
[21:18:01] <Cork> so no risk
[21:18:18] <nathanw478> what's the most effecient / easy way to target an input by name. on a page containing multiple copies of that input name, i need to target only one, relative to where on the page the button is clicked.
[21:18:55] <Cork> nathanw478: how is the button located relative to the inputs?
[21:18:56] <dannielly> Cork: awesome
[21:19:07] <diverdude> anyone?
[21:19:26] <Cork> dannielly: the problem will be to get access to the private data for your plugin
[21:20:01] <nathanw478> cork: one sec i'll create a js fiddle
[21:20:35] <Cork> diverdude: you want to append A at a specific existing point, or just wrap it before you append it?
[21:20:37] <_helpPlz_> hey
[21:21:06] <dannielly> Cork: i think i've got all that taken care of, i've got everything wrapped in a closure and i can just access varThatIsGlobalToAllInstances from anywhere
[21:21:20] <diverdude> Cork: basically wrap at that point where i wrote A inside the append
[21:21:47] <nathanw478> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/J4HjR/
[21:21:57] <Cork> diverdude: B.append($('<li><span>some text</span></li>').append(A));
[21:22:01] <nathanw478> cork: notice the checkbox called 'as above' on the second one
[21:22:13] <diverdude> Cork: where will it then inserst A?
[21:22:17] <diverdude> *insert
[21:22:26] <Cork> diverdude: after the span
[21:22:28] <dannielly> cork: also, $.namespace.pluginname isn't more "official?"
[21:22:28] <nathanw478> cork: i simply want to be able to click that and have it copy the values from the top one to the bottom one
[21:22:43] <_helpPlz_> that.parent().children(".valueStarGroup") ... is this slower than direct $(".valueStarGroup") ?
[21:22:46] <nathanw478> cork: but since there's heaps of them it will need to be 'the one above' .parent maybe
[21:22:47] <Cork> dannielly: not really
[21:23:30] <diverdude> Cork: what if i then want to do B.append('<li><span>some text</span>'+INSERT A HERE+'<span></span></li');
[21:23:31] <Cork> nathanw478: one sec
[21:23:59] <Cork> diverdude: it looks like what makes you confused is that you think your working with html
[21:24:01] <Cork> its not
[21:24:06] <Cork> your working with dom elements
[21:24:17] <nathanw478> cork: thanks, i've updated it with my current js http://jsfiddle.net/J4HjR/1/
[21:24:28] <Cork> so as long as you find the relative parent and sibling, just append/insert what you want
[21:25:11] <diverdude> Cork: yeah...true...but still i might want to insert my dom element at a specific point
[21:26:30] <Cork> diverdude: so find the relative dom element
[21:26:42] <Cork> you can't add it as string
[21:26:50] <Cork> as what you have is dom
[21:27:15] <Cork> nathanw478: just to be sure, you want to copy the previus form group right?
[21:27:39] <nathanw478> just the val()
[21:27:52] <Cork> the values?
[21:27:55] <nathanw478> so if the user fills out the form and wants to order the same thing on a different date
[21:27:56] <nathanw478> yes
[21:27:58] <Cork> or just quantity?
[21:28:09] <nathanw478> any of the text fields and i can replicate
[21:28:37] <nathanw478> cork: make sense?
[21:31:41] <Cork> nathanw478: http://jsfiddle.net/J4HjR/2/
[21:32:16] <Cork> that won't handle the checkboxes though
[21:32:51] <nathanw478> Cork: THANKS
[21:32:56] <Cork> np
[21:33:01] <nathanw478> Cork: can you explain a little?
[21:33:11] <nathanw478> Cork: need to be able to to do this stuff myself
[21:33:26] <Cork> first, live is depricated, so use delegate instead
[21:33:54] <Cork> $(document).on('click', "input[name^=ff_nm_asabove]") <-- this is what your live command did (plus an extra dom search)
[21:34:02] <Cork> so just converted it
[21:34:15] <nathanw478> .prevAll i haven't heard off before
[21:34:31] <Cork> in the checked section it finds the closest parent with the class btFieldset-wrapper
[21:34:47] <Cork> then it finds the closest sibling thats before it that has the same class
[21:35:13] <nathanw478> exactly what i was trying to do
[21:35:13] <Cork> the reason it doesn't use prev() is cause it only checks the prev direct sibling
[21:35:29] <Cork> thats why i do prevAll().last()
[21:35:52] <Cork> then it loops over all input elements in that group, and find the element with the same name in the current group
[21:36:12] <Cork> and finnaly sets the value on the corresponding element
[21:36:52] <Cork> though like i said, you need to fix its handling of checkboxes, its not handled
[21:37:06] <Cork> or rather its broken :)
[21:37:23] <tw2113> cork are you persecuting people?
[21:37:33] <Cork> O_o
[21:37:40] <Cork> tw2113: what do you mean?
[21:37:40] <tw2113> keeping you in line
[21:37:43] <tw2113> i dunno
[21:37:48] <Cork> heh
[21:37:50] <tw2113> the word was on my brain for a moment
[21:38:07] <nathanw478> okay, can you explain what's wrong with the checkbox method?
[21:38:22] <tw2113> too much bacon
[21:38:26] <Cork> nathanw478: checkboxes doesn't change the value, so val can't handle it
[21:38:40] <Cork> nathanw478: it needs to use prop('checked')
[21:38:58] <Cork> .prop('checked', $(this).prop('checked'))
[21:42:04] <nathanw478> hmm script isn't working on the main page for some reason
[21:43:49] <gf3> DID U TRY JQUERY>>>???
[21:44:12] <Cork> uh...?
[21:44:17] <nathanw478> lol
[21:46:14] <Eshu> HI Guy's
[21:46:35] <Eshu> Can anybody tell what is node.js?
[21:47:15] <Cork> Eshu: its a javascript engin you run on the server as a web service
[21:47:41] <Cork> but unless you have low performance demands its a really bad idea
[21:48:02] <nathanw478> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/J4HjR/3/
[21:48:11] <Eshu> Cork: any Example?
[21:48:27] <Cork> ?g nodejs
[21:48:29] <bot-t> Cork, node.js - http://nodejs.org/
[21:49:31] <Cork> Eshu: node.js will never handle more then one request at a time, and never more then one core
[21:54:09] <nathanw478> cork: any ideas?
[21:54:31] <Cork> nathanw478: ideas about what?
[21:55:05] <nathanw478> http://jsfiddle.net/J4HjR/3/
[21:55:12] <nathanw478> script is breaking when put in with the rest of the page
[21:55:19] <Cork> ah
[21:56:13] <nathanw478> cork: possibly because the div wrapper is used elsewhere, perhaps search for the text 'order details' instead?
[21:58:36] <Cork> nathanw478: replace last() with first()
[21:58:51] <Cork> (forgot that stupidity of preAll)
[22:00:07] <nathanw478> cork: thanks so much again
[22:00:12] <Cork> np
[22:00:25] <nathanw478> cork: can you explain why the script was broken and that fixed it?
[22:00:55] <Cork> prevAll() returns an array sorted in reverse to the dom order
[22:01:16] <Cork> so the last is index 0 and the first is index arr.length -1
[22:01:40] <Cork> so last() always found the first wrapper not the closest
[22:02:21] <nathanw478> i see. so it would have been finding the contact details instead of the order details
[22:02:30] <Cork> yes
[22:03:45] <nathanw478> i don't need to define all the variables do i
[22:03:59] <nathanw478> because your code you've written, .each
[22:04:09] <Cork> not the ones in the top no
[22:04:21] <Cork> you need $wrapper and $prev
[22:04:36] <Cork> and $prev isn't needed, strictly
[22:05:06] <nathanw478> yeah that's what I thought
[22:05:07] <nathanw478> :)
[22:05:26] <nathanw478> is there any resources you can recommend to get a  better understanding?
[22:05:40] <Cork> understanding of what?
[22:06:54] <nathanw478> jquery
[22:07:08] <asher^> anyone know how i can get the index of a jquery ui tab from its id?
[22:07:18] <nathanw478> cork: okay that's working on my main page but when you goto the third order field it stops working
[22:08:34] <nathanw478> cork: maybe needs .each onclick? so it fires for every asabove input?
[22:08:53] <Cork> nathanw478: nope
[22:09:07] <jherrisuan> when developing a plugin, is it okay to define it inside of $( document ).ready(function(){...})?
[22:09:12] <nathanw478> cork: what to do then?
[22:09:27] <nathanw478> http://jsfiddle.net/97ZdS/1/
[22:10:16] <gf3> jherrisuan: I'd say no
[22:10:40] <nathanw478> cork: only works for the first one, not each one
[22:10:43] <gf3> jherrisuan: If your plugin absolutely requires that, then it's likely you are doing something wrong
[22:11:59] <jherrisuan> gf3: basically for each element my plugin is instantiated on i want to add it to a div for custom positioning
[22:12:05] <nathanw478> cork?
[22:12:21] <jherrisuan> and i need to add that div before my plugin is instantiated on any elements
[22:13:00] <Cork> nathanw478: cause you need to have the same name on the fields
[22:13:05] <gf3> jherrisuan: You can define your plugin before ready, and have it run it's code after ready
[22:13:15] <Cork> ff_nm_variety[] != ff_nm_bfQuickMode95715[]
[22:13:26] <gf3> jherrisuan: That way people can use it instantaneously and it will have the same effect
[22:13:38] <nathanw478> OH
[22:13:40] <nathanw478> DOH
[22:13:48] <nathanw478> my bad, i haven't set all those up yet :p
[22:16:35] <jherrisuan> gf3: but where do i add the div to the dom?
[22:16:46] <gf3> jherrisuan: You want
[22:16:48] <gf3> er
[22:16:49] <gf3> wait
[22:17:06] <gf3> jherrisuan: You can call .ready() whenever you like
[22:17:16] <gf3> jherrisuan: So why not call it internally?
[22:18:53] <jherrisuan> .ready?
[22:19:23] <tw2113> is the bot back?

[22:59:46] <Eshu> Cork: are you around?
[23:00:22] <Eshu> what is the difference b/w jquery-1.6.4.min.js and jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.min.js
[23:00:45] <Eshu> one contain custom
[23:00:47] <asi> Hi. I'm developing a rundown menu which only shows 5 items initially and a "more videos" link. when the clicks the link it'll expand and show another 3 videos and change the text to "less videos". I also wanted to expand the list when a user clicks the one of 5 initial shown video thumbnails. I use 'toggle' method for "more video" link and use 'click' function for video thumbnail. Now, when user clicks the initially shown thumbnail I want to switch the "more vide
[23:00:48] <asi> link to it's second toggle state. How can I do it?
[23:00:52] <Cork> uh one is jquery the other is jquery-ui
[23:02:13] <Eshu> Cork: the code looks same then wht is basic difference? i download both from jqueryui.com
[23:04:15] <Eshu> ??
[23:05:12] <Cork> Eshu: it should be jquery ui and jquery
[23:05:22] <Cork> can't say anything more from just the file name
[23:06:25] <Eshu> Cork: thnx for the help. :)
[23:13:10] <rabbi1> I am using jquery tab (UI), i am also using onclick javascript event for some validations, doing so, i will have to remove the a href from the tab div. Is there a way i don remove this href and also the onclick functions as it is ?
[23:20:16] <prefixed> could someone explain what is wrong with my logic herein? http://pastebin.com/R2gjRYyL
[23:21:12] <Cork> ?demo @ prefixed
[23:21:12] <bot-t> prefixed, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:21:28] <Cork> prefixed: provide both code AND html when you want help with structure
[23:23:04] <prefixed> Cork SITE: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ and the code that I just provided SHOULD be setting the "currentPlayer" element to the next element when the element in question does not contain a media player.
[23:24:46] <prefixed> however, the code causes an endless loop when it gets to an item without any media player
[23:27:32] <Cork> prefixed: why not just do $(currentPlayer).closest('.views-row').nextAll('.views-row').find('.jplayer').first() ?
[23:28:10] <prefixed> sec, I need to look up nextall and first
[23:28:31] <ryanaz> I'm trying to verify the XML data I'm getting back from an ajax post, what's the easiest way to have it printed out so i can see what it is?
[23:29:42] <tw2113> console.log() ?
[23:30:06] <asher^> hi guys, i have a button on a page that seems to check/uncheck a checkbox on the same page for no apparent reason. any ideas why this could be?
[23:30:24] <Cork> asher^: not without seeing it
[23:30:39] <ryanaz> is that built into safari?
[23:30:46] <prefixed> Cork can you explain what was wrong with my logic though?
[23:31:06] <tw2113> no but i am rather certain it'll work in safari ryanaz
[23:31:13] <tw2113> crack open the inspect tool
[23:31:22] <ryanaz> can you see the data in inspect?
[23:31:31] <tw2113> if you console.log it
[23:31:34] <tw2113> click the console tab
[23:32:13] <tw2113> console.log('myvar')
[23:32:33] <Cork> prefixed: 1. its over complicated, 2. it ends up in an infinite loop if the element doesn't exist
[23:32:54] <prefixed> Cork why does it end up in an infintie loop?
[23:33:10] <Cork> cause it expects to find the element and loop until it finds it
[23:33:19] <Cork> it never checks if there is none
[23:33:49] <prefixed> Cork so hypothetically, how would I use next() to find the next element?
[23:34:09] <Cork> prefixed: skipp the loop skipp the if and just use the line i gave you
[23:34:18] <Cork> it should do the same as all those lines
[23:34:29] <Cork> it will give you the next jplayer in the page
[23:34:35] <ryanaz> Here's my xml I'm getting back from the host:   <data status="success" />   Why can't this find "status"  ?  var status = $(xml).find("status").text();
[23:34:41] <prefixed> Cork I am. I just wnat to understand why I couldn't make it work.
[23:34:42] <Cork> or and empty jquery object if there is none
[23:36:11] <ryanaz> Cork:  any thoughts as to why that xml thing isn't working?
[23:36:31] <ryanaz> it works fine if the xml is :  <data><status>success</status></data>
[23:36:38] <rabbi1> I am using jquery tab (UI), i am also using onclick javascript event for some validations, doing so, i will have to remove the a href from the tab div. Is there a way i don remove this href and also the onclick functions as it is ? http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/QBBXW/1/
[23:36:45] <Cork> ryanaz: status is an attribute, not an element
[23:36:56] <ryanaz> sure, but find can't find the attribute vs element?
[23:37:03] <Cork> ryanaz: you would have to do $(xml).find('[status]')
[23:37:12] <ryanaz> oh jezz.. picky picky
[23:37:18] <Cork> not picky
[23:37:29] <tw2113> attributes !=== elements
[23:37:39] <Cork> it would be frustrating i you went looking for an element and got a random attribute instead
[23:39:08] <tw2113> this isn't the element you're looking for *hand wave*
[23:39:34] <greggies> yeah sure it isn't

[23:51:23] <ryanaz> cork:                var status = $(xml).find('[status]');   // this isn't working
[23:51:46] <ryanaz> <opt>​<data status=​"success">​</data>​</opt>​
[23:52:04] <tw2113> i wonder if .attr() would work
[23:52:32] <ryanaz> attr .. nope
[23:52:40] <Cork>  var status = $(xml).find('[status]').attr('status'); should
[23:53:08] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/YAWUJ/1/ <-- how do i check which ancestor clicked img is under.
[23:53:32] <ryanaz> Cork:  Yup, that worked... why do I have to tell it status twice?
[23:53:43] <Cork> larsemil: $(this).closest('imageslider')
[23:53:47] <Cork> opps sorry
[23:53:50] <Cork> larsemil: $(this).closest('.imageslider')
[23:54:08] <Cork> ryanaz: the first one finds the data element, the second picks out the attribute
[23:54:39] <ryanaz> ... right instead of just saying text() ..
[23:54:42] <larsemil> Cork: <3
[23:54:56] <ryanaz> for something like that, would you use something else?  or is this the right approach?
[23:56:53] <larsemil> Cork: does it work down the hierarchy as well? like doing $('#imageslider_1').closest('.imagepicker') allthough its three steps DOWN the hierarchy=
[23:57:03] <Cork> no
[23:57:09] <Cork> it looks in the parent chain
[23:58:01] <larsemil> cool. thanks
