[00:03:01] <sacho_> how do you know it's not working
[00:03:17] <wer0ckz> there's no pop-up
[00:03:51] <wer0ckz> i tested it using xampp in my machine, it works. but with out xampp, it's not working. is it the flash needs to have  webserver?
[00:06:09] <sacho_> so use the developer tools to figure out what's stopping the pop-up to appear
[00:06:23] <sacho_> perhaps the request is being rejected
[00:18:08] <Determinist> is there any way for me to know when the browser's done processing the layout of a piece of HTML i've just appended into the DOM?
[00:19:55] <Determinist> e.g.: $('.someDiv').append('â€¦big chunk of htmlâ€¦'); window.getComputedStyle($('.someDiv .something')[0]).fontSize <--- fontSize will report the wrong size, because the browser's not yet done processing the cascade and layout from the different css rules that would apply to the content i've just appended into .someDiv
[00:20:58] <Determinist> now, I could use a setTimeout() and give the browser some time to do its thing, but this seems clunky to me, given that on slower devices (either mobile or desktop), this might not be enough time
[00:21:21] <codedreamer> wrap whatever you want to run after inside a function on the arguments
[00:22:01] <testazerrty> Determinist can't you use .delay(n ms)
[00:22:12] <codedreamer> use a callback
[00:22:18] <codedreamer> no delays
[00:22:22] <Determinist> a callback of what?
[00:22:46] <Determinist> this isn't an AJAX request loading that content, it's just a <script type="text/template"> â€¦</script> tag that i'm pulling the content out of
[00:23:08] <Determinist> does append have a callback? :)
[00:23:14] <testazerrty> Tha(s why I suggest the ugly delay(). It is there for a reason
[00:23:28] <codedreamer> im finding link
[00:23:30] <codedreamer> hold on
[00:23:34] <Determinist> k
[00:23:47] <codedreamer> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/wait-till-function-complete-execution
[00:24:01] <sinnick> #DragonJAR.org
[00:24:18] <codedreamer> callback will execute after everythign is finished
[00:24:31] <codedreamer> then just supply an inline function
[00:25:18] <testazerrty> codedreamer . not trying to be funny but in the OP example where would he write his callback ?
[00:25:31] <Determinist> codedreamer: are you sure this will indeed wait for the browser to do it's thing? because i'm not sure
[00:26:08] <codedreamer> yes it will. i use it in my jquery i write daily
[00:26:22] <Determinist> codedreamer: could you provide an example?
[00:27:01] <Determinist> i could append stuff into the div that has display none and then use "show" with a callback, but i'm not sure how exactly that'll work
[00:27:09] <codedreamer> are you using document ready?
[00:27:26] <codedreamer> for you jquery?
[00:30:27] <Determinist> codedreamer: of course, but this isn't happening on document load
[00:32:12] <codedreamer> $('.someDiv').append('…big chunk of html…',function() {runafter();});
[00:33:00] <sahbeewah> what the heck is that?
[00:33:35] <sahbeewah> Determinist, successive lines run in order, and anything appended to the dom will immediately have any style rules applicable to the elements
[00:34:38] <testazerrty> codedreamer. I have never seen that syntax of .append. and I just checked the docs online. the only function I could find is supposed to return the Html to be appended.
[00:35:05] <Determinist> codedreamer: same here, i've never seen append used like that
[00:35:17] <testazerrty> from the doc if that works, it does not seem 'official' or I misunderstand the doc and what you say
[00:35:20] <Determinist> sahbeewah: well, not according to what i'm seeing.
[00:35:29] <codedreamer> its not a function parameter its a framewrok option
[00:35:39] <Determinist> codedreamer: what framework? :)
[00:35:43] <codedreamer> jquery
[00:35:52] <codedreamer> its how you execute callbacks
[00:35:53] * Determinist blinks
[00:36:05] <Determinist> codedreamer: have you ever tried this?
[00:36:29] <codedreamer> lol yes i write jquery for a living in silicon valley
[00:36:48] <sahbeewah> Determinist, i'm proposing that what you think is the problem isn't the problem, try look elsewhere
[00:37:20] <testazerrty> Could you point us to where in the docs it says it should work for append().
[00:38:10] <testazerrty> sahbeewah I had the same issue last week on mobile Chrome. Append returning just before the dom was fully updated
[00:38:38] <Determinist> sahbeewah: what i'm seeing is fairly consistent. if I delay the getComputedStyle by 1000ms, it will report the correct result, if not, it will not
[00:38:53] <Determinist> sahbeewah: trying a hack right now with visibility hidden, show and a callback
[00:39:58] <defaultro> hey guys, what's the best way to parse an application/atom+xml file?
[00:40:24] <Determinist> the show/hide method works
[00:40:46] <Determinist> defaultro: detailsâ€¦ where from? size? same/cross domain request?
[00:40:58] <defaultro> local file
[00:41:09] <defaultro> i downloaded it
[00:41:41] <defaultro> wanted to try how to use it and build a jquery mobile app
[00:42:05] <defaultro> it's my first time seeing this kind of xml
[00:42:41] <Determinist> defaultro: jquery can process xml just fine, look for some online example of how to use it with xml, shouldn't be hard to find.
[00:42:49] <defaultro> k
[00:43:28] <Determinist> apparently this issue wasn't really resolved, btw. the only reason it appeared to be was because show(function()â€¦) has soem default setting for its animation, but that looks weird.
[00:45:24] <testazerrty> Determinist I did a quick fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/dQ3LX/ to codedreamer's specs and can't get it to work
[00:46:38] <Determinist> testazerrty: append can take multiple args, but all of them are elements/text to be appended, his syntax shouldn't work and if it does, that's probably a side-effect
[00:46:50] <codedreamer> lol
[00:46:52] <Determinist> read: possibly a bug
[00:47:16] <Determinist> gotta go gents, parenthood > coding
[00:47:17] <codedreamer> http://www.impressivewebs.com/callback-functions-javascript/
[00:47:32] <testazerrty> agreed 100% -  codedreamer care to look at the fiddle ?
[00:47:37] <Determinist> be back in a bit. thanks for your help, live long and prosper.
[00:48:57] <Determinist> codedreamer: you seem to be having some sort of confusion about certain things in jquery/javascript. this isn't meant as an insult, but simply constructive criticism. dig deeper.
[00:49:11] <Determinist> i'm out.
[00:50:10] <codedreamer> my 6 figure salary at a multimillion dollar company would disagree
[00:50:35] <codedreamer> i dont have time for you newbs
[00:50:40] <codedreamer> need everything spponfeed
[00:51:12] <testazerrty> would you have time to correct my fiddel ? http://jsfiddle.net/dQ3LX/ I am always happy to learn from a Master
[00:51:35] <testazerrty> or are U too busy counting your $ ?
[00:51:47] <sahbeewah> he left already
[00:51:51] <sahbeewah> what a douche
[00:52:12] <sahbeewah> also, that is such a retarded misinformed article
[00:52:42] <testazerrty> Yeah, shame . lol too right about the article. I guess I won't learn something today :)

[01:10:15] <defaultro> hey guys, how do we export an existing code that was written in jsfiddle?
[01:10:16] <Lucky--> anyone seen Memento? trying to pick something to watch and go to bed to?
[01:11:03] <irnux> I want to apply a code only to <ul>s whose ids have the from "myid-[0-9]+". How can I do that?
[01:11:14] <irnux> I don't want other <ul>s affected.
[01:11:53] <irnux> I'm not sure if slice() works
[01:13:12] <hallas> $('ul[myid-*]') ?
[01:13:41] <hallas> id="â€¦" even
[01:15:00] <irnux> could you please be clearer?
[01:15:45] <hallas> [0-9]+ just means any whole number
[01:15:59] <hallas> so use a selector an to find all ul with an id that match that pattern
[01:16:22] <hallas> one such selector would be $('ul[id="myid-*"]').each(fn);
[01:16:47] <irnux> ok, thanks
[01:16:49] <hallas> let fn be a function that apply your code to every u that match the pattern one by one
[01:16:50] <irnux> I'll try
[02:28:36] <NoOova> Hello all! I checks checkbox with .attr('checked', 'checked')
[02:28:45] <NoOova> but it works only in first time
[02:28:47] <NoOova> why?
[02:29:29] <NoOova> if i remove check from checkbox and run code again, checkbox will has attribute checked="ckecked" but does not has check
[02:30:19] <Gazpacho> noova: use true and false for that
[02:30:29] <NoOova> it does not work too
[02:30:56] <Gazpacho> using 'checked' is not the solution
[02:31:04] <NoOova> http://jsfiddle.net/HccLu/
[02:31:12] <NoOova> please, see
[02:31:19] <Gazpacho> no, i'm drunk
[02:31:39] <NoOova> click button, than remove check from checkbox, and click again
[02:31:55] <NoOova> there is 2 lines of code
[02:32:34] <Gazpacho> well, what do you expect? You always set the checkbox to true.
[02:32:46] <Gazpacho> always the same value
[02:32:59] <NoOova> click with mouse to checkbox
[02:33:06] <NoOova> and remove check from it
[02:33:22] <NoOova> and click button to add checked status again
[02:34:02] <Gazpacho> then I guess you want this  http://jsfiddle.net/HccLu/2/
[02:34:37] <NoOova> yes, but it works only two times
[02:35:12] <NoOova> first click - checks, second - unchecks, more clicks - nothing happens
[02:39:18] <NoOova> hm.. it works with jquery 1.6.4 but not works witn 1.9.1
[02:41:14] <Gazpacho> nooova read this http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[02:41:21] <Gazpacho> that's all
[02:41:48] <Gazpacho> better to trust the jquery docs than a drunk guy who doesn't know what he's saying
[02:43:07] <NoOova> thanx...

[03:16:10] <zza7> Hi. I make a GET request. In the success function I'd like to parse the returned data, but I don't know how...
[03:16:58] <zza7> I made several attempts in vain : http://jsfiddle.net/nwRwt/
[03:31:31] <sahbeewah> zza7, you can't do cross-origin get on html without access to the server
[03:42:48] <zza7> sahbeewah :  from a chrome extension it possible, isn't it ?
[03:46:35] <sahbeewah> haven't written a chrome extension
[03:46:43] <sahbeewah> but this is probably what you're looking for: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declare_permissions.html
[03:47:36] <sahbeewah> you can bypass the same origin policy by specifying the necessary permissions in the plugin
[03:48:39] <zza7> Oh no that's not what I meant. My get request is OK. I receive the answer I'm expecting. But I'd like to parse this answer with jquery, and it does not work.
[03:51:34] <zza7> More details : http://jsfiddle.net/nwRwt/4/
[03:53:02] <zza7> But I think there is a beginning of answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050333/jquery-ajax-parse-response-text
[03:54:18] <zza7> With jquery I can't parse an HTML string that contains elements that are invalid within a div, such as html, head, body, or title elements
[03:56:30] <sahbeewah> that's true, but that's not why it's breaking
[03:56:58] <sahbeewah> parseHTML doesn't return what you think it returns... you can't simply wrap the value it returns inside $() and expect it to work
[03:58:25] <zza7> Too bad :( How should I do then ?
[04:00:11] <sahbeewah> well if you're serious about doing it properly/efficiently, you should console.log the response of parseHTML and process the array it returns accordingly
[04:00:21] <sahbeewah> here's a quick-fix hack though: http://jsfiddle.net/nwRwt/5/
[04:04:22] <zza7> I like your hack, it works very well :p
[04:04:34] <zza7> Thanks a lot :)
[04:05:02] <zza7> I'm trying the parseHTML solution, just to see :)
[07:06:11] <utterglee> hello there folks
[07:06:28] <zth> does it matter if i put the <script src="pathtojquery.js"> in the head, or is it ok to just put it where i'll have the script? i'll only be having one jquery script on the site
[07:07:03] <utterglee> may I ask for some wisdom on choosing a validation plugin: I am using twitter bootstrap, and I'd love to have minimal friction integrating a form validation plugin that supports showing of custom messages
[07:10:59] <even_> utterglee:  http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[07:11:26] <even_> zth:  is always better to have the js and the html separated
[07:11:35] <utterglee> thank you even_
[07:11:59] <utterglee> that turned up in my search but now it has a human endorsement for bootstrap =)
[07:21:38] <juboba> how can I add a button to a dialog already opened?
[07:23:06] <zth> even_, so i should put my scripts in head i guess?
[07:24:45] <even_> zth:  nop.. in a js file and then add the reference in your <head></head>
[07:25:31] <even_> juboba: buttons: {         "New button": function() {}
[07:59:24] <juboba> even_, but if the dialog is already open?
[08:00:59] <shoky> juboba: .dialog('option', 'buttons', { ... buttons ... })
[08:15:25] <Miral> test
[08:17:37] <even_> shoky:  do you have any idea how to fix this http://jsfiddle.net/QLMQH/102/.. the map is being displayed correctly only the first time the tab is clicked
[08:36:51] <even_> =/
[08:47:38] <shoky> even_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QLMQH/106/
[08:48:47] <shoky> even_: actually not sure you even need that "else" part to trigger a resize
[08:49:32] <shoky> even_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QLMQH/107/  seems fine too
[08:49:40] <even_> shoky:  i was wondering which is the problem with tabs
[08:50:20] <shoky> even_: the problem is that the map's tab is hidden before you activate that tab
[08:50:36] <even_> oh
[08:52:23] <shoky> (and using onclick doesnt help because the click is triggered before the tab is actually shown)
[08:52:40] <shoky> exactly what the tab events are for
[08:53:07] <even_> shoky: i see.. thanks buddy
[09:02:49] <even_> shoky:  just to clarify why did u defined map and marker outside?
[09:12:50] <shoky> even_: the map i defined outside because i also use it in the tabs show function.  the marker doesnt matter in that example
[09:13:18] <even_> thanks

[11:37:34] <V8Energy> $("#new_transaction").clone() clones a form tag and its content and i am able to return it. but when I surround it with div tag such as this: "<div>" + $("#new_transaction").clone() "</div>", for some reason it no longer returns the form tag and its content, instead i get: [object Object]. how do i fix it?
[11:47:07] <cincyguy5646> v8Energy. try  this $div = $("<div />") $div.html( $(#new_transaction).clone() );
[11:48:18] <V8Energy> what's the difference between $div and var div?
[11:48:33] <cincyguy5646> it tells the dom it's a jquery object
[11:49:45] <V8Energy> roger. thanks
[11:52:20] <V8Energy> cincyguy5646: actually i am trying to stick it inside <tr> <td> </td> </tr>.. $("<tr > <td></td> </tr>").html($("#new_transaction").clone()) doesn't do the trick
[11:53:39] <Tyraziel> Hi All!  â€” trying to figure out why my ajax call using jquery 1.7.2 even though I specify post for a REST call, it seems to not want to put the data in the POST data segment ($_POST in php).  I wonder if it's the content type i'm sending it (application/json).  PUT works as expected.
[11:53:44] <cincyguy5646> let
[11:54:22] <cincyguy5646> v8Energy what object's html are you referring to in this $("<tr > <td></td> </tr>") ?
[11:54:33] <Tyraziel> consequently POST places the data in the same spot as PUT where in PHP you have to do the following to get the data â€” parse_str(file_get_contents('php://input'), $put_vars);
[11:54:53] <V8Energy> cincyguy5646:  i am trying to stick the cloned object inside the td tags and append it to the form. appending isn't an issue though.
[11:55:35] <V8Energy> when I do: $("<tr > <td></td> </tr>").html($("#new_transaction").clone()) I get: <tr> <form....>form content</form> </tr>
[11:55:47] <V8Energy> so for some reason it overwrites the <td>
[11:56:06] <Rahly> Tyraziel: perhaps the content type is wrong?  PHP will only parse params if the content type is correct
[11:56:25] <cincyguy5646_> let me fiddle it one minute
[11:57:39] <Tyraziel> @Rahly â€” that's what I was thinkingâ€¦ content type of a post is suppose to be - application/x-www-form-urlencoded, even though I'm sending JSON?
[11:58:24] <Rahly> well if you are actually POST json, then $_POST/$_GET/$_REQUEST will be empty
[11:58:38] <Rahly> for example contentType: "application/json"
[11:59:02] <Tyraziel> rightâ€¦ that's what I found outâ€¦ it was sent as the body, which php had to get with what i pasted above â€” the php://input part
[11:59:16] <Tyraziel> so that works fine for PUT
[11:59:17] <Rahly> then you have to   $json_post = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true);
[11:59:44] <Tyraziel> rightâ€¦ that's what i did as a temporary fixâ€¦ but from the REST perspective that's not "ideal"
[12:00:02] <Tyraziel> basically â€” if $_POST doesn't have data get it from php://input
[12:01:03] <Rahly> according the the php rfc it will only process variables if its content type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data
[12:01:39] <Tyraziel> so i made the change and bingo it worked!  Thank Rahly!  What should the mime type be for $_GET, or is that also in the php rfc?
[12:01:48] <Rahly> php doesn't know how to handle a json/xml post
[12:01:56] <Tyraziel> i see
[12:02:30] <Rahly> $_GETs don't need a mime type, BUT, it will send as a string.... so
[12:02:50] <Rahly> script.php?json={"json":true},  it will be a string
[12:03:04] <Rahly> $json_data = json_decode($_GET['json'], true);
[12:03:19] <Tyraziel> so as long as i put in the ajax call as GET it will put what I pass in as data as the query string in the URL?
[12:03:48] <Rahly> yes, but be careful, a lot of servers have a limitation on a query line
[12:04:11] <Rahly> posting is usually the safest way
[12:04:15] <Tyraziel> ok great!  yeah the GET wasn't going to pass a ton of data to the REST service
[12:04:45] <Tyraziel> trueâ€¦ but in "REST" GET is how you're suppose to get data from the serverâ€¦ like www.example.com/employee?id=5
[12:04:53] <Tyraziel> will get the data from the employee who's ID is 5
[12:04:57] <Rahly> for example, apache has a request line limie of 8190 bytes
[12:05:06] <Tyraziel> so the data passed in is very light
[12:05:08] <Rahly> but can be changed with server configuration
[12:05:18] <Tyraziel> apache.conf i assume
[12:05:36] <Rahly> correct, but at that point, the GET isn't json anymore
[12:05:54] <Rahly> yeah, LimitRequestLine is the directive to configure
[12:06:08] <pachet> V8Energy: $('<tr><td></td></tr>').children().append($whatever.clone())
[12:06:16] <pachet> but that's really clunky ;[
[12:06:22] <Tyraziel> ok cool.  Thank again Rahly!  Your help is greatly appreciated!
[12:06:29] <V8Energy> as long as it works. u'r the best. thank you!
[12:07:18] <Rahly> pachet: why doesn't $('<td />').append($whatever.clone()); work?
[12:07:38] <V8Energy> pachet: it doesn't return the tr though
[12:08:11] <V8Energy> it returns the cloned object inside the tr
[12:08:15] <V8Energy> i mean td
[12:08:35] <Rahly> V8Energy: try adding a .end() at the end
[12:08:58] <V8Energy> Rahly: wow... nice. I wonder how that works
[12:09:20] <Rahly> because the first jquery creates the tr/td
[12:09:29] <Rahly> then the children() rescope it to just the td
[12:09:39] <Rahly> and then end() reverts it back to the first jquery
[12:10:55] <Rahly> i usually do something like this  $('<tr /'.append( <nl> $('<td />').append( ) <nl> );
[12:18:22] <Rahly> i'm curious if anyone knows why $('<div />', {class:'here', id:newid}); works but  $('<div class="here" />', { id: newid }); fails
[12:19:27] <eddiemonge> because <div class="here" /> isnt a valid creator?
[12:20:10] <Rahly> well  $('<div class="here" />')  works
[12:20:15] <gnarf> ragas: i would suggest not using that form of creating elements
[12:20:16] <gnarf> but
[12:20:21] <gnarf> to answer your question
[12:20:51] <gnarf> the $("<tag>", attrs) method only really works for 'simple' tags ( that don't define any attributes )
[12:21:28] <Rahly> if it was added in 1.8, why would you suggest not using it?
[12:21:47] <Rahly> will it be removed?
[12:22:14] <gnarf> it wasn't added in 1.8
[12:22:31] <gnarf> was like 1.6 i think?
[12:23:08] <gnarf> its just one of those shortcuts that has always left a sour taste in my mouth
[12:23:24] <systemfault> Another thing is that some implementations might now like the "class" keyword you used.
[12:23:27] <gnarf> mainly because the way it actually works is a little strange
[12:23:33] <systemfault> s/now/not
[12:23:44] <Rahly> oh sorry, confused, just scanned the doc and above the example, it said "As of jQuery 1.8"
[12:23:48] <gnarf> like, if there is a jQuery.fn.id = ....;
[12:24:02] <gnarf> it calls that instead of setting the id attr
[12:24:11] <Rahly> ahhh gotcha
[12:24:25] <Rahly> it seemed highly convenient
[12:24:36] <gnarf> so it can be a useful shortcut, sure... but the ambiguity of its design is a tad unreliable IMO
[12:25:05] <Rahly> yeah, i'll have to stop using it, if it could create undefined results like that
[12:27:39] <V8Energy> I have an on click event which works, but once a new element is added that should match the click event, it doesn't work. is there anyway to update the on click event?
[12:28:15] <gnarf> Rahly: i think like 80% of the team hates that signature too ;)
[12:29:18] <Rahly> gnarf: the only reason I liked it, is because normally you have to call 3 different functions, thats all.
[12:29:27] <Rahly> .css() .attr() .on
[12:29:31] <gnarf> V8Energy: you have to attach an event after you create the element --- or --- use event delegation --- bind the event to a higher element in the DOM (like document) and provide a selector:   $(document).on("click", ".selector", handler);
[12:29:50] <gnarf> Rahly: if you have to call .css() when generating an element, you're doing it wrong
[12:29:58] <gnarf> use a class ;)
[12:30:24] <V8Energy> gnarf: interesting. I will try binding it to a higher eleemnt
[12:30:29] <gnarf> honestly, it's possible to do a LOT without ever using .css() in jQuery, just rely on addClass/removeClass
[12:30:52] <gnarf> V8Energy: you can read more about it here:
[12:30:54] <Rahly> normally do, but I sometimes I don't see a point when one thing is slightly different than the rest
[12:30:54] <gnarf> `api on
[12:30:54] <b-ot> gnarf: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:31:16] <gnarf> Rahly: .class.slightlyDifferent
[12:31:24] <gnarf> :)
[12:31:47] <Rahly> i already have over 2,000 classes, i hate making more
[12:33:50] <eddiemonge> Rahly: 2000?
[12:34:07] <Rahly> over
[12:34:17] <eddiemonge> is it a large site? i normally dont even have 2000 lines of css
[12:34:25] <Rahly> very large
[12:35:39] <Rahly> js download is dynamic, and minified, anywhere between 100k (jQuery,jQuery-ui) to 40megs depending on options set up
[12:40:17] <eddiemonge> 40mb? are you serious?
[12:42:03] <Rahly> yes
[12:42:22] <avinashrbhat> dude, 40 megs? Are you drunk? that is impossible.... 0_o
[12:42:29] <zophy> i ate a 40 mb hot dog one time, boy were my arms tired after that
[12:43:13] <sonotos> Rahly: is this a browsergame or some kind of a strange RIA?
[12:43:13] <Rahly> just doing a   wc -l `find . -iname "*.js"`  gives me   3458154 total
[12:43:24] <Rahly> neither
[12:45:16] <sonotos> well we have 2.5 megs code in a RIA minified + gzip compressed to 250kb and we have everything included i can imagine from d3js, jquery ui. several plugins, tiny mce etc. what are you doing if y may ask?
[12:45:51] <Rahly> yeah, one of our devs just added tiny mce with about a billion hacks
[12:46:22] <Rahly> looks nice, but very ugly with jquery-ui theming
[12:46:53] <sonotos> 40mb tiny mce?
[12:46:58] <Rahly> no
[12:47:15] <Rahly> that was just added to the repo last version iteration
[12:47:29] <sonotos> ah kk, but what kind of appication is that?
[12:47:58] <Rahly> Medical billing/collections/scheduling/ehr
[12:48:20] <sonotos> Rahly: like http://s-db.de/files/upload/prev_screens/
[12:49:06] <Changa> Hello -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?p=home&l=EN -> on this page if you click on the mennu items all my submenu's are shown. If you click something else, it works fine. The first click is showing more than need, can you spot what's causing this?
[12:50:23] <eddiemonge> Changa: your css should go before your js
[12:50:39] <Changa> this will fix it?
[12:50:44] <Rahly> sonotos: what do you mean?
[12:51:03] <eddiemonge> Changa: your custom js should also go after the other plugins
[12:51:36] <sonotos> Rahly: like the same type of masks / technical functinonality / page elements
[12:52:05] <Rahly> some parts, sonotos, but others, no, looks more like a project planner
[12:52:15] <sonotos> it is
[12:52:27] <Changa> eddiemonge : fixed these.
[12:52:48] <sonotos> well at least it's juts a demo projekt for a code generator and the demo is a project planner app
[12:52:48] <Changa> its still messing up with the first click on the navigation
[12:54:34] <Rahly> sonotos: thats kewl, i've starting working on a ticketing system integrated, we've tried several which don't work out, right now we are using intervalsonline.com.  Unfortunately, its hard to get these systems to match our workflow.
[12:56:26] <sonotos> Rahly: :-) that's exactly my business model, where are building that kind of tools exactly by the customer requirements and integrate them into their existing infrastructure
[12:58:21] <Changa> eddiemonge: any ideas?
[12:58:38] <YammYcoding> when i hover a button here, the bg animates, can anyone tell me what is causing this?
[12:58:40] <Rahly> thats kewl, code or service based?
[13:00:03] <sonotos> Rahly: let's put that in a query, don't want to spam the jquery channel
[13:01:55] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: huh?
[13:02:24] <YammYcoding> can you see the site? i can't find out what is animating the button on hover
[13:04:15] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: its a simple hover animation
[13:04:50] <eddiemonge> Changa: you got a lot of code but most of it is duplicated and could be simplified by combining but your question, no idea since i dont even see the event handlers
[13:05:08] <Rahly> simple transform rotation
[13:05:51] <Changa> eddiemonge : event handler is $(window).hashchange( function(){ doHashChange(); } and its the function
[13:05:52] <newcandy> Hello guys. Am I allowed to ask a half-technical question about a 3rd party jquery app here? I'm totally blank, and cant figure out why it's not working. It's about JSON formatting
[13:09:21] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ newcandy
[13:09:21] <b-ot> newcandy: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:09:21] <bot-t> newcandy, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:10:28] <newcandy> The silent consent, allright. I'm using a rich text editor called Redactor (made by Imperavi). It has an image upload function where I use php to upload images to the server. I return a json string back to the page which magically pops the image into my textarea (dont know how). Redactor also has a file browser which is triggered by a variable in my html , where I give a link to a .json file
[13:10:28] <newcandy> which consists of all the json strings my uploader has given back to the page. For some reason the image browser doesnt show me the images, actually shows nothing.
[13:10:48] <YammYcoding> eddiemonge i expected a hover to change image, not animate the changing.
[13:10:59] <YammYcoding> eddiemonge i have no idea why it's anymating
[13:11:53] <alainus> for a div with data-ribbon="somevalue" I want to do: $('[data-ribbon]').prepend("<div class=\"ribbon-wrapper\"><div class=\"ribbon\">"+$(this).attr("data-ribbon")+"</div></div>");. But the $(this).attr("data-ribbon") is coming out as "undefined". What am I doing wrong? thans
[13:11:53] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: it could be js animation or css animation. its not hard to do
[13:12:01] <newcandy> Actually.. I think my json formatting is the problem here. Let me try that first, sorry
[13:12:03] <YammYcoding> could i figure it out whre the animation is coming from?
[13:12:40] <YammYcoding> but i can't figure it out what is causing the animation there
[13:14:34] <newcandy> It was bad json formatting. realized it as I wrote the question :)
[13:15:43] <alainus> Shouldn't $(this) be working fine in that example ?
[13:17:08] <eddiemonge> alainus: no because this there is window
[13:17:34] <eddiemonge> alainus: you want a .each with that code inside
[13:19:07] <alainus> eddiemonge, worked, thanks
[13:19:37] <Changa> eddiemonge: any ideas on my case?
[13:21:10] <eddiemonge> Changa: like i said, try simplyfing and im sure the answer will present itself
[13:21:52] <Changa> I just did one simplifying
[13:21:59] <Changa> and it didn't solve the issue
[13:22:11] <Changa> I know I need to stop hardcoding everything like this
[13:22:36] <Changa> if you can show me the way
[13:22:41] <Changa> coz I'm stuck.
[13:23:30] <tripflex> is there any easy way to use both " and ' in jquery
[13:23:39] <tripflex> as in this.append(mydata)
[13:23:42] <tripflex> but mydata
[13:23:46] <tripflex> is actually a php include
[13:23:54] <tripflex> that has some javascript in it and html
[13:23:57] <YammYcoding> eddiemonge i just found it! there was an easing css animation here
[13:24:00] <tripflex> so it uses both ' and "
[13:24:01] <YammYcoding> thanks! :)
[13:27:10] <Changa> Hello -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?p=home&l=EN -> on this page if you click on the mennu items all my submenu's are shown. If you click something else, it works fine. The first click is showing more than need, can you spot what's causing this?
[13:32:35] <eddiemonge> tripflex: huh?
[13:33:51] <rebel_yell> How do you save javascript requests in an array?
[13:34:46] <rebel_yell> like when a response comes back 200 ok
[13:34:51] <rebel_yell> how do i store the link?
[13:35:29] <tripflex> eddiemonge, so like if i wanted to do this
[13:35:48] <tripflex> this.append('myshit is 'the best' and "you know" it is');
[13:35:51] <tripflex> obviously that wont work
[13:35:57] <tripflex> but it has both ' and " inside
[13:37:32] <rebel_yell> eddiemonge: hey bro remember you were telling me a code last time
[13:37:42] <Gazpacho> rebel: how do you save anything in an array?
[13:38:57] <rebel_yell> i know how to save things to an array
[13:40:09] <Gazpacho> you mean you want to save the link that you successfully requested?
[13:41:10] <rebel_yell> Gazpacho: when ajax call is made i want to save the 200 ok
[13:41:30] <Gazpacho> pass a callback function to the request that does that
[13:43:13] <rebel_yell>         $(document).ajaxStart(function(){
[13:43:21] <rebel_yell> so function(callback)
[13:46:09] <Gazpacho> no, ajaxStart has nothing to do with it
[13:46:37] <Gazpacho> save the request result inside a callback passed to .ajax or .get
[13:48:36] <zophy>  www.jqueeryery.com
[13:49:07] <Gazpacho> zophy: sounds kinda gay
[13:51:00] <cincyguy5646> ?
[13:51:50] <Gazpacho> ?
[13:51:58] <chigambamukoko_> greetings
[13:53:35] <chigambamukoko_> Gazpacho: how are you my friend?
[14:08:38] <cincyguy5646> help
[14:08:43] <cincyguy5646> ?
[14:17:33] <didiergm> cincyguy5646 ask your question
[14:19:23] <cincyguy5646> sorry did i was trying to figure out how to use the bot-t
[14:20:06] <didiergm> kk @cincyguy5646
[14:25:03] <meeper_> hey, has anyone notice any problems with responseXML on ajaxSuccess going from 1.8.2 to 1.9.1?
[14:26:47] <meeper_> for whatever reason, my responseXML is now only showing up under responseText under ajaxSuccess(function(){})
[14:28:25] <eTiger13> ?
[14:28:53] <Rahly> no, are you sure content type is correct on the result?
[14:31:00] <Gazpacho> yes meeper, they have  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13388
[14:32:40] <meeper_> yes the content type is the same, that bug looks like it too
[14:36:07] <cincyguy5646> anyone know where i can find an example of a jquery ajax call to the google contacts API v3 library?
[14:38:27] <meeper_> thanks for pointing out that bug Gazpacho, at least I know I'm not going crazy.  Since that ticket is 6 weeks old, does anyone have any idea when 1.9.2 will be released?
[14:39:36] <cincyguy5646> found it, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13942978/google-contacts-api-cant-call-max-results-with-jquery-ajax , just in case anyone else wanted to know..
[14:47:17] * alaing looking forward to meeting ajpiano next Friday
[14:47:46] <alaing> ajpiano: are you in the UK now?
[14:48:36] <GOMADWarrior> If reality is a simulation, are we players or NPCs
[15:18:54] <portishead> welcome to jquery, it's a new world, it's a new dawn, it's a new day.
[15:22:14] <meeper_> how and to who do I report an error in the jquery mobile documentation?
[15:22:54] <meeper_> don't really want to create an account on the multitude of places that bugs get filed on
[15:24:40] <meeper_> anyway, the jquery mobile example for the column toggle reflow table refresh method has an error
[15:25:15] <meeper_> it says to use $( ".selector" ).table-columntoggle( "refresh" ); to refresh the table which is incorrect and produces a reference error for columntoggle
[15:25:49] <meeper_> the proper code (just tested as working with dynamically added content is $( ".selector" ).table( "refresh" );
[15:26:58] <meeper_> the minus sign confuses the browser into thinking that table and columntoggle are two different things.. after much googling about things that have happened over the last few days, a simple table refresh added in 1.3.1 does the trick, the docs just need to be updated
[15:28:18] <meeper_> the reflow table widget docs have the right example, the column-toggle widget does not
[15:30:32] <eTiger13> meeper_: submit a pull request to fix it
[15:31:24] <meeper_> don't even know how eTiger13
[15:31:37] <meeper_> I don't use github
[15:31:40] <JoseffB> hey got a question
[15:31:54] <meeper_> should probably learn one of these days
[15:32:08] <JoseffB> trying to duplicate a data row and change the forms array name to increase by one digit
[15:32:36] <JoseffB> fieldname[0][value] to fieldname[1][value]
[15:33:41] <wilornel> JoseffB: fieldname[1] = fieldname[0]; ?
[15:33:45] <meeper_> JoseffB: are you trying to copy DOM elements or just data?
[15:34:06] <JoseffB> entire dom  then modify the copy with the updated data id
[15:34:21] <JoseffB> I can update the dom easy but hte ids stay the same
[15:34:23] <meeper_> take a look at .clone()
[15:34:32] <JoseffB>     var q = $(divToDuplicate).clone();
[15:34:32] <JoseffB>     //var v = q.replaceAll('[0]', '['+i+']');
[15:34:32] <JoseffB>     var z = q.appendTo(destinationWrapper);
[15:34:48] <JoseffB> this works except cant replace and even then I dont know the next number
[15:35:27] <meeper_> hmmm...
[15:35:44] <JoseffB> wierd replaceall gives a error
[15:36:13] <meeper_> well are they all heading to the same destinationWrapper? cause you could try doing a .length to get the count and then add 1
[15:36:20] <wilornel> JoseffB : You should try to iterate through each elemnt in q and do .val(fieldname[1][value]);
[15:37:13] <JoseffB> actually I can add a data element into the div and the function for the number
[15:37:19] <JoseffB> the replaceALL isnt working though
[15:37:26] <portishead> guys, I am trying to POST with ajax but I fail miserably, can anyone take a look? http://pastebin.com/34UBn2Cw
[15:38:17] <wilornel> how exactly do you "fail"?
[15:38:24] <wilornel> what's the eror?
[15:38:26] <meeper_> JoseffB: I'll have to admit I've never tried duplicating a set of dom elements that way, I've done what wilornel suggested and walked through each element
[15:38:50] <JoseffB> wilornel how do you msg?
[15:38:56] <wilornel> right click my name
[15:38:58] <wilornel> query
[15:39:02] <portishead> wilornel: it just doesn't post it properly because the php returns parameters are missing
[15:39:14] <wilornel> ok so you get a response?
[15:39:30] <portishead> wilornel: http://pastebin.com/zh1VLRfQ that's the php
[15:39:47] <eTiger13> portishead: do the ajax request in the form submit, not on button press
[15:39:53] <wilornel> I'd like to know what's happenning in the console.log(data); part
[15:40:13] <eTiger13> portishead: otherwise you form is still going to submit
[15:41:05] <portishead> wilornel: it's undefined
[15:41:16] <wilornel> portishead: What browser are you using?
[15:41:28] <portishead> eTiger13: but making it a submit refreshes the page and I don't want it
[15:41:32] <portishead> wilornel: chrome
[15:41:33] <wilornel> Open up the network tab in the dev tools on chrome, get to the same TAB on firebug for firefox
[15:42:01] <eTiger13> portishead: thats what im saying. do the ajax request in the form submit and preventDefault so the form doesnt submit
[15:42:31] <wilornel> eTigers: His button does not submit the form
[15:42:42] <wilornel> His button is just a useless one
[15:42:47] <wilornel> which trigegrs a javascript event
[15:44:08] <eTiger13> portishead:  http://jsfiddle.net/xTUuj/
[15:44:20] <eTiger13> wilornel: it does "submit" the form
[15:45:31] <portishead> it's now working eTiger13
[15:46:02] <portishead> can I set the php charset ?
[15:51:20] <JoseffB> how do I count all the instance of a class in a div?
[15:52:19] <talkr> JoseffB: $('div').find('.classname').length
[15:52:27] <JoseffB> ok thanks
[15:52:29] <JoseffB> ill try that
[15:55:51] <portishead> eTiger13: it doesn't work when I am using the e.preventDefault();
[15:56:17] <portishead> wilornel: I guess you were right, should I go to the XHR on the network tab?
[15:56:18] <JoseffB> hey whats wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/9FA9xQsp
[15:57:04] <shoky> JoseffB: that's not how you use .replaceAll
[15:57:11] <JoseffB> portishead: did you change the submit button from type button to submit?
[15:57:20] <JoseffB> I ran into this yesterday and it was that
[15:57:31] <portishead> yaeh
[15:57:44] <JoseffB> ah, shoky how do you replace it in my instance then?
[15:58:09] <shoky> JoseffB: i'm not sure what you want to replace. q is a jquery object wrapping a div, it seems. it's not a string
[15:58:37] <shoky> replace/replaceAll is for replacing elements with other elements
[15:58:39] <JoseffB> i tried q.html.replaceall and errored out
[15:58:46] <portishead> JoseffB: it doesn't work
[15:59:02] <shoky> JoseffB: strings don't have a replaceAll method..
[15:59:17] <eTiger13> JoseffB: $('destinationWrapper'). probably shouldnt have quotes
[15:59:34] <shoky> that too
[15:59:37] <JoseffB> it doesnt in  the code
[15:59:50] <shoky> or it should be $('.destinationWrapper') or something
[15:59:53] <shoky> if it's a class
[16:00:31] <shoky> oh oops
[16:00:37] <JoseffB> its destinationWrapper
[16:00:40] <JoseffB> its a variable
[16:00:43] <shoky> yeah it's the argument, sorry
[16:00:47] <shoky> no quotes, then
[16:00:54] <arkeid> got an issue
[16:01:05] <JoseffB> i remove the replace all and its ok but then blah
[16:01:06] <JoseffB> l;ol
[16:04:12] <portishead> nobody understands ?
[16:05:16] <arkeid> you guys have any idea how can i avoid creating the same dialog everytime i click the link.. http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/14/
[16:07:31] <eTiger13> arkeid: create it before and then change the content and then open it
[16:08:42] <arkeid> eTiger13:  before?
[16:08:53] <shoky> arkeid:  your 'if' doesn't make sense. you just created the div, it won't possibly have that class or be visible
[16:09:29] <arkeid> shoky:  i mean that.. everytime i click search i create another instance of the same dialog
[16:09:43] <arkeid> shoky:  instead of going to the same one
[16:10:41] <shoky> regardless of what you mean, that if is wrong
[16:11:01] <arkeid> shoky:  oh yeah sorry.. forget about that if.. i was trying something
[16:11:19] <arkeid> shoky:  forgot to take it out in the fiddle
[16:11:38] <shoky> oki, just wanted to point it out
[16:13:57] <brrc> Hello everyone, my question is the following, is there any plugin to sort items order, for example have 10 ascendent numbered items, and simply by drag and drop change their position.
[16:14:06] <arkeid> i'll appreciate any suggestion
[16:15:37] <arkeid> brrc:  you mean like the jquerygrid plugin?
[16:15:59] <brrc> humm let me check it on google, and I'll get back to you in a sec.
[16:16:15] <shoky> brrc: jquery-ui sortable
[16:16:46] <brrc> hello shoky, you helped me a few months back :P
[16:18:48] <brrc> arkeid nop not that, jquery-ui sortable is exactly what I want :d
[16:18:50] <brrc> hehehe
[16:19:43] <arkeid> well it also has the sortable option i guess
[16:20:39] <shoky> hi brrc
[16:21:37] <shoky> arkeid: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6qgTr/15/
[16:21:53] <shoky> arkeid: but of course, it won't work with google.com , you can't .load() that into a div
[16:22:30] <arkeid> shoky:  sure.. something is wrong when i close it.. is it possible?
[16:22:50] <brrc> can I change the the <li>'s ID upon change?
[16:23:33] <shoky> arkeid: ah cause i did $('a') and the close button is also an <a>
[16:23:58] <arkeid> ohh all right
[16:24:37] <shoky> arkeid: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6qgTr/17/
[16:25:00] <arkeid> shoky:  is it possible to implement that code in a function and fire it in the onclick event like i had before?
[16:25:15] <shoky> arkeid: it's possible.. it's not recommended
[16:25:25] <arkeid> shoky:  why?
[16:25:36] <arkeid> to keep html and js separated?
[16:26:21] <shoky> arkeid: yep thats the main reason
[16:26:44] <arkeid> okk.. thanks shoky
[16:30:05] <shoky> brrc why would you want to change its ID?
[16:30:30] <shoky> you can, if you want to, sure..
[16:31:19] <brrc> shoky to save it as a form then, but found something here with serialize
[16:31:34] <shoky> form's dont use the id attribute
[16:31:51] <shoky> forms >;|
[16:32:55] <brrc> id, name, placeholder whatever :D hehehe
[16:33:35] <brrc> i know, through a form should use the value attr
[16:34:09] <wilornel> brrc
[16:34:13] <wilornel> you're trying to change an id?
[16:35:09] <portishead> is there a way to re-evaluate all of the javascript on the document?
[16:35:39] <wilornel> portishead: rerun it?
[16:35:53] <shoky> but then, you'd have to rerun the rerun
[16:35:58] <shoky> fun ensues
[16:37:23] <brrc> wilornel, yes.
[16:37:31] <wilornel> brrc: got it working?
[16:37:33] <portishead> wilornel: how?
[16:38:02] <wilornel> portishead: Could you please elaborate what you want to achieve
[16:38:22] <brrc> wilornel, no why? got any help?
[16:38:52] <wilornel> got any code? From which element do you want to change the id?
[16:39:58] <portishead> wilornel: I got my ajax post request to work with the help of joseffb, it outputs(using the echo function, php) javascript but it renders it as text on the document
[16:40:00] <brrc> the id of and <li> for example
[16:51:49] <wilornel> brrc: $('li').attr('id', 'newId'); there...
[16:53:07] <wilornel> portishead: an echo in a php which responds to an ajax call is not supposed to output on the document. The echo's content should only appear in the data variable of the ajax's callback
[16:58:12] <brrc> wilornel: thank you very much :)
[16:59:16] <arkeid> shoky:  one question.. if i have multiple search links.. everytime i open a different dialog will make the last one dissapear?
[17:37:46] <klnlnll> I have a quick question, does anyone know why this doesnt work? http://jsfiddle.net/6Fjm6/2/
[17:38:09] <klnlnll> I mean the adjusting the position of the dialog after it is created
[17:38:53] <Whirl3d_> shoky are you around?
[17:47:59] <menikmati> how do you get the checked property of a checkbox like true or false? i did console.log($('#checkbox')); and it says checked: false and when i do .attr("checked") and console it out it says undefined
[18:06:50] <klnlnll> http://jsfiddle.net/6Fjm6/3/ can anyone tell me why the div doesn't center after it loads?
[18:06:55] <klnlnll> pleaseeee =)
[18:21:02] <tripflex> klnlnll, it does center?
[18:21:14] <tripflex> you're talking about the modal popup right
[18:34:47] <Gazpacho> klnlnll if you want the dialog centered in the browser window, you can pass a more detailed description of the position than just "center". See the documentation for "position"
[18:36:57] <Gazpacho> i guess it doesn't help there though, because the page runs in an iframe
[18:41:48] <Gazpacho> bah
[19:07:27] <JustSighDudes> Is getElementById javascript or jquery?
[19:12:36] <Gazpacho> it is DOM
[19:13:18] <Rahly> Sounds like a bad Godfather remake
[19:36:47] <sprezzatura> i am showing a confirm dialog box in my page when the user presses a button. even if the user presses 'cancel' the form is getting submitted. There are no errors in the page(as seen from firebug)How do i debug this.
[19:40:39] <otters> is there an ondragover callback I can hook into for droppable? I need to do more than just add a class
[19:40:40] <bot-t> (45 hours 30 mins ago) <coldhead> tell otters if i will never forget you
[19:40:48] <Gazpacho> make a jsfiddle to show what you're doing
[19:43:03] <otters> okay well I guess this is a proof of concept, http://jsfiddle.net/tY7P4/
[19:43:15] <otters> but I don't know if the callback exists but I can't do what I want to do which is change the width of the div to follow the user's cursor
[19:43:27] <Tyraziel> so say I have a table that's 100x100 and I have a JSON object that brings me back data that contains X and Y coordinates in itâ€¦ how can i dynamically get jquery to get me the td I'm looking to update?
[19:43:37] <sprezzatura> ok. i was not returning false. sigh!
[19:43:45] <Tyraziel> i'm trying this right now â€” $("table > tbody > tr:nth-child("+x+") > td:nth-child("+y+")") and that's not working
[19:44:11] <Tyraziel> i probably have x / y flipped but that's ok for now
[19:46:08] <Tyraziel> nvm
[19:46:11] <Tyraziel> i had my selector wrong
[19:46:40] <Tyraziel> it originally had "#tableID > table" which clearly wouldn't have workedâ€¦
[19:46:55] <Tyraziel> so what I pasted above actually works incase anyone needs something similar
[19:49:45] <doubleemms> Is there anyone here who might be able to help me understand a problem with jQuery UI?  I keep ending up with negative position values on my draggable/resizable widgets.
[19:51:49] <snover> stop dragging so far
[19:52:05] <doubleemms> :|
[19:55:54] <doubleemms> Resizing or moving items will sometimes cause them to jump offscreen.  Inspecting the DOM shows that they are there in the tree, but have crazy position values.
[20:14:38] <Gazpacho> wish this channel would kick idlers
[20:15:22] <tw2113> why
[20:15:35] <Mage> that's like, what 90% of irc is
[20:18:18] <Rahly> i think 90% of my logs would disagree
[20:18:30] <Rahly> mostly quit and join message :-D
[20:19:04] <tw2113> disable them from showing
[20:36:30] <gnarf> yeah, i turn off join/part
[20:36:48] <gnarf> but idling is useful, gives you something to read ;)
[20:37:19] <gnarf> and considering 10 or so of those "idlers" are actually the chanops, prolly another 10 team members, etc
[20:37:29] <gnarf> the other 400 of em can sit here too
[20:37:30] <gnarf> :)
[20:39:16] <gnarf> shoky: hey, it was you i was tweeting at today yeah?
[20:39:42] <gnarf> austinite?
[20:39:46] <gnarf> no txjs
[20:43:57] <otters> so there's no event that's fired whenever a draggable is moved when it's over a droppable?
[20:44:09] <otters> I see over and activate, but nothing that looks like onDrag
[20:54:42] <utterglee> hello there folks
[20:55:07] <utterglee> I'm looking for a name for my problem: a set of 'switchlike' checkboxes
[20:55:50] <gnarf> radio? utterglee
[20:56:08] <utterglee> hmm, something like that gnarf
[20:56:16] <utterglee> sorry I was still typing out the details
[20:58:00] <gnarf> otters: dropover dropout?
[20:58:18] <tw2113> sup gnarfy
[20:58:26] <gnarf> utterglee: http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-over
[20:58:34] <gnarf> er otters^^^^
[20:59:21] <otters> that just fires once
[20:59:33] <gnarf> oh
[20:59:42] <gnarf> sorry mised that word
[20:59:50] <utterglee> basically, I'm trying to use mapster: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/examples/usa.html
[21:00:11] <gnarf> you need to bind to the draggables drag event on over, and unbind on out maybe?
[21:00:24] <gnarf> otters: ?
[21:00:37] <gnarf> tw2113: not much, in austin - kickin back
[21:00:37] <otters> oh, yeah, that's probably what I need to do
[21:00:39] <utterglee> shucks I'm also in another convo... will be back
[21:00:46] <gnarf> `w Austin TX
[21:00:46] <b-ot> gnarf: â˜ Mostly Cloudy 67.4Â°F/19.7Â°C. Austin, TX
[21:00:49] <otters> except that this is all bound up with angularjs
[21:01:23] <gnarf> otters: the dragable is part of the ui object passed as arg 2 to the event i think
[21:01:56] <gnarf> so you can .on("drag") it
[21:08:01] <otters> gnarf: thank you
[21:08:39] <gnarf> otters: no prob
[21:21:54] <Third3ye> How do you append a container over something?
[21:28:29] <gnarf> Third3ye: css positioning?
[21:44:51] <PenguinMan98> Hey everybody
[21:45:34] <PenguinMan98> I'm trying to solve an issue where I've got a function declared in the global scope that I would like to invoke from an ajax .done() handler but it gives me a ReferenceError
[21:46:05] <PenguinMan98> What's the best way to get to that function to invoke it from within the handler?
[21:51:10] <Andrew_R> PenguinMan98: it should be just available if it
[21:51:14] <Andrew_R> it's global
[21:51:59] <PenguinMan98> Well, I found this question on Stack Overflow that matches my situation. It was never answered
[21:52:09] <PenguinMan98> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13447336/referenceerror-when-calling-a-regular-javascript-function-as-a-callback-from-jqu
[21:52:49] <PenguinMan98> I tried what they recommended and made sure my functions had ; on the end and moved it above the definition of the handler
[21:54:15] <PenguinMan98> buuut, it didn't work
[21:54:28] <gnarf> PenguinMan98: paste? fiddle?
[21:54:44] <Andrew_R> link?
[21:56:17] <Andrew_R> PenguinMan98: also, make sure you don't have any syntax errors in your global function
[21:57:14] <PenguinMan98> http://pastie.org/7494531
[21:58:20] <PenguinMan98> Here is the full global function: function confirmPostRand( rand ){   var temp_temp_msgs = new Array(); // temporary array.   var confirmed = false; // stores if I found the rand in the list of pending posts   for(var i = 0; i< chat_temp_msgs.length; i++){ // go through the pending posts 	  if(chat_temp_msgs[i].rand != line.chat_rand){ // if it's not the one I'm looking for 		  temp_temp_msgs.push(chat_temp_msgs[i]); // move it
[21:58:27] <PenguinMan98> drat
[21:58:32] <PenguinMan98> http://pastie.org/7494534
[21:59:12] <gnarf> PenguinMan98: is it in scope of another function? can you just paste the whole js file?
[22:00:17] <PenguinMan98> No.  Here are the full two functions as they appear in my .js file
[22:00:19] <PenguinMan98> http://pastie.org/7494541
[22:01:08] <Andrew_R> I don't think passing in "rand" and then using "chat_temp_msgs[i].rand" is going to do what you think it does
[22:01:25] <PenguinMan98> I've been re-writing this chat program for my personal use so there are some lingering remnants of the pre-jquery ajax
[22:01:59] <PenguinMan98> The chat_temp_msgs[i] is an object with an element named 'rand'
[22:02:18] <Andrew_R> ok, I noticed that "rand" wasn't being used anywhere, so I thought maybe you were trying to use the value of the parameter to get some object
[22:02:31] * PenguinMan98 nods
[22:03:21] <PenguinMan98> I'm trying to add some stability to the program by storing each post I send to the server in an array called chat_temp_msgs and then popping them out as they come back from the server.
[22:04:09] <PenguinMan98> Then I should be able to check quite easily to see if a post failed to send and ensure I don't get duplicate responses.
[22:06:23] <Andrew_R> what is the full error?
[22:07:00] <PenguinMan98> ReferenceError: confirm_post_rand is not defined http://localhost/mlpnwrpdev/public/chat/ajax-chat/js/ajax-chat.js Line 375
[22:07:24] <PenguinMan98> oh shit, I spotted the spelling goof
[22:08:12] <PenguinMan98> Invoke the function as confirm_post_rand instead of confirmPostRand
[22:08:20] <Andrew_R> haha - I don't see confirm_post_rand in your paste at all
[22:08:25] <PenguinMan98> but elsewhere in the file, not in the paste
[22:08:36] <PenguinMan98> in the OTHER ajax call
[22:08:36] <Andrew_R> :)
[22:11:06] <PenguinMan98> sorry to bother you all with my idiocy ^^
[22:11:52] <Andrew_R> haha no problem
[22:12:59] <gnarf> PenguinMan98: you shouldn't need to encodeURIComponent those values
[22:13:14] <gnarf> jquery's ajax does that to the data object
[22:13:37] <PenguinMan98> Yeah.  That's what I meant about lingering leftovers from the original non-jquery ajax
[22:14:36] <PenguinMan98> thanks for pointing it out though
[22:14:47] <PenguinMan98> *deletes
[22:29:03] <HAPPYFUNBALL> is there a way to use fadeout / fadein to change the order of the z-index stack rather than changing an element's display parameter?
[22:36:01] <Andrew_R> HAPPYFUNBALL: is this sort of what you are looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/X6LkA/
[22:40:51] <HAPPYFUNBALL> Andrew_R yes
[22:40:53] <HAPPYFUNBALL> thanks
[23:54:03] <aneki> anyone know why my tabs arent hiding/showing in latest jquery ui?
