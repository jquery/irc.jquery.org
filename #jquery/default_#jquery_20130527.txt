[00:02:37] <unnu> can i add a form to the FormData object when i construct it?
[00:03:13] <unnu> like var myform = FormData($("#formid"));
[00:03:42] <Cork> man...
[00:03:50] <Cork> unnu: are you even reading the responses?
[00:04:23] <unnu> Serializearray
[00:04:24] <unnu> yeah
[00:04:27] <unnu> i remeber
[00:04:43] <Cork> then why do you keep asking the same broken question over and over again?
[00:07:24] <unnu> BECAUSE SERIALIZEARRY DOESN'T SEND SHIT
[00:07:25] <unnu> sorry
[00:07:28] <unnu> caps
[00:07:39] <unnu> but yeah, im not getting any data
[00:13:43] <Pal> Hi.....i have lot of label tags in html page in that i wanna trigger the next label when the previous label is clicked
[00:14:03] <Pal> $('.class').find('label')
[00:14:12] <Pal> i tried but not working
[00:14:24] <Pal> Any other way
[00:19:53] <Cork> $('label').index($(this).index() + 1).click()
[00:20:23] <unnu> Cork, i have no clue what i am doing wrong . . .
[00:22:13] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/9uHqw/
[00:27:01] <unnu> its empty
[00:27:04] <unnu> every time
[00:27:06] <unnu> its empty
[00:27:16] <unnu> ive been working on this for 7 straight hours
[00:27:21] <unnu> why the hell is it empty?
[00:27:25] <unnu> there is fucking data there
[00:30:17] <moijk_> lol
[00:30:31] <moijk_> now unnu, what have you been working on?
[00:30:51] <moijk_> joined too late to get the full extent of your problem
[00:31:13] <unnu> i just wanna pass a form into a ajax call
[00:31:15] <unnu> thats it
[00:31:21] <unnu> the form gets loaded via ajax
[00:33:11] <unnu> when i click an anchor an ajax call is made to a page with 'action' set to addpost. a body div loads with some html that makes up a form. i want to take the data in the form and upload it . . . . .  im not getting anything. i can append the variable and read from it just fine, i just can't figure out how to put the form information into the variabl
[00:33:12] <unnu> e
[00:33:41] <unnu> if you can help, awsome, but im not gunna respond for 5, nic break
[00:39:24] <unnu> back
[00:39:38] <unnu> so moijk_ any ideas why its empty?
[00:40:43] <moijk_> you got any code in a pastebin?
[00:41:29] <moijk_> it is hard to guess just by symptoms
[00:42:04] <unnu> give me a min to let the extra suff out
[00:42:55] <GoSox> So I have an image with an image map. I'm using mouseenter() on the 'area's of the image map, and that works fine. I'm trying to use mouseleave() on the image itself to clean up, but it doesn't seem to trigger. Are events not getting to the image because the image map is stopping it? or is something else going on?
[00:44:43] <Cork> GoSox: image map is a quite old feature, it might be it doesn't work with mouseenter
[00:44:57] <Cork> GoSox: but do you have a fiddle with the code?
[00:45:00] <GoSox> the enter is what works though
[00:45:04] <GoSox> working on a fiddle now
[00:45:08] <GoSox> that sounds so gay
[00:45:15] <Cork> :)
[00:46:28] <GoSox> ok here we go. mouse of the stars. they change color. When you leave, it should revert back to all green stars
[00:46:44] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/3YT6D/3/
[00:46:50] <GoSox> "should" meaning, "i want it to"
[00:48:30] <GoSox> same thing, with an unused line of code removed http://jsfiddle.net/3YT6D/4/
[00:49:28] <GoSox> even if the image map is on top of the image, don't events propagate down? isn't that why i have to stopPropagation when i'm using clicking off of an item to dismiss that item
[00:50:01] <Cork> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/3YT6D/5/
[00:50:18] <moijk_> GoSox: if you put the mouseleave to the form id (not the img) it works
[00:50:23] <Cork> you never hover the image
[00:50:30] <Cork> so you can't get a mouseleave
[00:50:43] <GoSox> ok but theres a lot more in the form than just this one thing
[00:50:54] <GoSox> do i just wrap the image in a span?
[00:50:57] <moijk_> then make a container for the img then
[00:51:01] <Cork> GoSox: put it on the map
[00:51:11] <Cork> no need for a container
[00:51:15] <GoSox> oh i seeeeee
[00:51:21] <GoSox> got it
[00:51:23] <Cork> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/3YT6D/5/ <--
[00:52:29] <GoSox> Cork: so why wasn't i hovering the image? i don't get why it didn't work
[00:52:32] <GoSox> (but it is working now)
[00:52:47] <Cork> cause the map is taking the interaction not the image
[00:52:57] <GoSox> so it doesn't pass it on
[00:52:59] <Cork> you hover areas in the map, not the img for example
[00:53:07] <Cork> its not a child or a parent
[00:53:15] <Cork> so it doen't bubble
[00:53:57] <GoSox> oh i see
[00:53:59] <GoSox> weird
[00:54:13] <Cork> like i said, it's an old element
[00:54:20] <Cork> it predates javascript
[00:54:30] <GoSox> its a good fit for this though
[00:54:33] <Cork> today it would prob never have been implemented
[00:55:52] <seutje> oh man, I hate image maps
[00:55:54] <GoSox> Cork: so theres another part of this that is working the way i want, but i don't know why
[00:56:47] <GoSox> when i click and drag on this particular image, it doesn't try to pull it off the screen like other images. This is good because you want you to be able to drag across it to set the value. But I don't get what is actually stopping the 'wrong' kind of dragging from happening
[00:56:56] <Cork> GoSox: personally i would prob have made the same thing based on a div with a tags
[00:57:14] <Cork> (the a tags so there was a none js fallback link solution)
[00:57:24] <GoSox> Cork: i already have sets of images made up where each set of 5, so it was easier doing it this way
[00:57:43] <Cork> GoSox: so?
[00:57:51] <GoSox> so what?
[00:57:52] <Cork> the links doesn't have to hold the images
[00:57:59] <Cork> :)
[00:58:09] <Cork> anyway do it as you like
[00:58:14] <GoSox> ok well, divs, areas, ultimate its all the same
[00:58:20] <Cork> the draging of images can be disabled btw
[00:58:42] <GoSox> Cork: yeah thats the thing, apparently i did it, and i wanted it to be done, but i don't see what in that fiddle i sent you was responsible for it
[00:58:58] <Cork> its cause you interact with a map, not an image
[00:59:09] <GoSox> oh is that it
[00:59:14] <GoSox> same reason as the other thing
[00:59:23] <seutje> it lays on top, and eats everything
[00:59:29] <GoSox> ok good
[00:59:32] <GoSox> thats just what i wanted
[00:59:39] <seutje> sorta like plugins tend to do
[01:00:38] <seutje> like when u wanna close the tab and flash is all like "nope, my keypress!"
[01:00:44] <Cork> :)
[01:00:55] <Cork> ya, those really old elements tend to be horrible
[01:01:15] <Cork> btw i REALLY wish mozilla got there wish about plugins
[01:01:22] <Cork> it would have been really sweet
[01:01:24] <seutje> ?
[01:01:41] <Cork> it's in the w3c mailing list about pepper
[01:01:57] <Cork> mozilla wanted to instead of inventing pepper use canvas and webaudio
[01:02:11] <Cork> and just hand that to the plug and say "here do you stuff"
[01:02:33] <Cork> in other words plugins would basically work like web content
[01:03:09] <Cork> it would allow multi threading without problems an all kind of other nice stuff
[01:03:41] <Cork> (browser drawing not beeing dependent on the plugin being done)
[01:05:48] <seutje> oh
[01:06:48] <GoSox> Cork: so with my image and image map, i'm trying to change the cursor to a pointer. But it's not working on the image, or the map, or the areas. is it not possible in this configuration, because you can't style a map, and the map blocks the image?
[01:07:21] <Cork> not 100% sure. but ya, that sounds likely
[01:07:47] <Cork> seutje: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-April/000088.html
[01:07:53] <Cork> wrong mailing list sorry
[01:07:57] <Cork> :x
[01:08:40] <seutje> s'ok :P
[01:09:33] <Cork> google went "we don't care in the long run, we just want to make it suck a little less"
[01:09:38] <Cork> *sigh*
[01:10:16] <seutje> ppl who use biblical quotes as e-mail signature scare me though :x
[01:10:52] <Cork> seutje: heh, be prepared to be scared, it quite common in different web standard mailing list :x
[01:10:55] <seutje> xcept priests, they don't need an e-mail signature to scare me
[01:11:04] <Cork> lol
[01:11:14] <seutje> Cork: I know, scares the bejeebus out of be
[01:11:16] <GoSox> email sigs should be two lines at most, and you shouldn't use them at all if you're going to be an active part of a mailing list. It reminds me of car forums, where people like to reply with one or two line responses to threads, yet they have giant 100px tall signatures. the threads become more signature than content
[01:11:48] <seutje> as long as they don't contain 20MB GIF movies
[01:12:09] <GoSox> hah i had a customer recently that was having email problems. "I only tried to send something very small from my phone"
[01:12:10] <Cork> GoSox: as long as the mail client puts at the absolute end of the mail body i couldn't care less
[01:12:15] <GoSox> it was a 170 MB 'short' video :D
[01:12:33] <Cork> but some of them put it before the message they respond to, and that is annoying
[01:12:53] <Cork> especially those that have 10+ lines of signature >_<
[01:13:34] <GoSox> i have another client that insists on putting a logo and links to all of their sites, blogs, facebooks in their email sig. so every email comes across as having an attachment, and half of them get caught up in spam filters with all the links.
[01:13:57] <Cork> lovely
[01:15:07] <seutje> that reminds me, I gotta update my signature
[01:15:14] <seutje> or rather, I was asked a month or 2 ago
[01:18:10] <GoSox> is the text in a <textarea> still accessed with .val() ?
[01:18:17] <GoSox> (even though there is no value attribute)
[01:18:29] <Cork> yes
[01:29:18] <unnu> okay
[01:29:25] <unnu> imma stab this screen
[01:29:53] <GoSox> if you tend to attack your monitors, i suggest you go retro and get some CRTs
[01:29:58] <GoSox> they can take a shocking amount o fabuse
[01:32:26] <GoSox> unintentional pun
[01:32:54] <Cork> GoSox: don't forget to use tippex for correcting type errors :)
[01:33:09] <GoSox> meh
[01:33:32] <GoSox> off topic but since it's dead, anyone know how i can insert a line break into the placeholder text of a textarea tag?
[01:33:42] <GoSox> i tried \n and \r but no luck
[01:33:48] <Cork> don't think you can
[01:33:53] <GoSox> really?
[01:33:56] <GoSox> you must!
[01:34:00] <Cork> just like you can't add line breaks in title attributes
[01:34:40] <Cork> attributes has no way to express line break so...
[01:35:00] <GoSox> but a textarea can accept line breaks
[01:35:36] <Cork> yes
[01:35:40] <unnu> \n\r
[01:35:47] <Cork> and that is why it doens't take it as value=""
[01:35:47] <unnu> also
[01:36:00] <GoSox> unnu: nope
[01:36:03] <unnu> \../,
[01:36:10] <unnu> because rock
[01:36:54] <GoSox> oh wow
[01:36:58] <GoSox> there is a way to do it
[01:37:08] <GoSox> an actual return in the string itself, in your source
[01:37:15] <unnu> nl2br
[01:37:19] <GoSox> so the value of the attribute takes up multiple lines
[01:37:22] <GoSox> craziness
[01:37:52] <unnu> nl2br()
[01:37:57] <unnu> php ftw
[01:38:02] <Cork> GoSox: "User agents should present this hint to the user, after having stripped line breaks from it"
[01:38:07] <GoSox> unnu: has nothing to do with what i'm trying to do
[01:38:18] <Cork> so by definition they are obligated to remove any form of linebreak
[01:38:18] <unnu> why not?
[01:38:27] <unnu> im sure you could code it in somewhere
[01:38:42] <unnu> they arn't funny, but i still make them
[01:39:06] <Cork> GoSox: http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute
[01:39:55] <GoSox> webkit preserves the linebreaks and presents them quite well
[01:40:04] <xec_> Cork: looks like title attributes allow it though
[01:40:07] <Cork> GoSox: then file a bug for webkit
[01:40:18] <GoSox> firefox preserves them too, but also adds all teh white space from text indentation in the source code
[01:40:48] <Cork> xec_: not cross browser though
[01:41:08] <Cork> or at least it didn't use to be cross browser (they might have moved that to be consistent now days)
[01:41:28] <xec_> Cork: according to the spec, i mean
[01:41:43] <xec_> Cork: although, it seems fine in ie10, and latest chrome and ff
[01:42:01] <Cork> xec_: ya, i remember a bug about it from a few years back
[01:42:18] <Cork> not sure if it was before, under or after the new html work
[01:43:54] <Cork> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/xpEQp/ becomes 123456789 in both chrome and firefox for me
[01:45:03] <GoSox> Cork: same here. and yet, with my code in there: http://jsfiddle.net/xpEQp/1/
[01:45:29] <Cork> GoSox: extend the size of the textarea
[01:45:32] <GoSox> i did
[01:45:34] <Cork> it wraps
[01:45:40] <Cork> it doesn't keep the linebreaks
[01:45:44] <ragsagar> I am using jquery file upload, to upload to multiple files. When i am uploading file which is more that 1mb or something, it tries to upload, after few seconds the uploading restarts, after few attempts like this it returns error unable to upload
[01:45:44] <GoSox> it does in safari
[01:46:16] <GoSox> it does in firefox too, but it also preserves the tabs which make it look terrible
[01:46:19] <Cork> no
[01:46:29] <Cork> it keeps the normal characters
[01:46:34] <GoSox> huh?
[01:46:35] <Cork> that is not the same as linebreaks
[01:46:45] <Cork> space and tab; yes
[01:46:51] <Cork> but the line breaks is removed
[01:47:38] <GoSox> oh wow, that's a very strange coincidence, that it happened to line up in teh fiddle and on my site
[01:48:55] <Cork> so i can verify that your fiddle is broken in firefox, chrome and opera
[01:49:08] <Cork> safari is in another office space so i would have to go there to test it >_>
[01:49:14] <Cork> (mac)'
[01:49:15] <GoSox> yeah i've given up
[01:49:40] <GoSox> ill just put the placeholder text in a div that hides the textarea, and swaps them on clicking an 'ok' button
[01:50:17] <moijk_> what is broken in everything?
[01:50:18] <thujone> ragsagar, maybe your service provider has a limit?
[01:50:40] <Cork> moijk_: not really broken, it's according to spec
[01:50:53] <Cork> line breaks is removed from placeholder attributes
[01:51:06] <moijk_> i see, so the poster wanted line breaks
[01:51:24] <Cork> yes
[01:51:30] <unnu> alright cork, ive done tons of research for hours
[01:51:32] <unnu> and im lost
[01:51:45] <Cork> moijk_: and mistook wraps for line breaks
[01:51:45] <GoSox> yeah i wanted line breaks in my placeholder, so I could list some guidelines in a way that users… may actually have bothered to read before writing a review.
[01:51:48] <unnu> the form SHOULD be in the variable
[01:51:57] <unnu> but its empty
[01:52:17] <unnu> is it  because the form isn't on the page when the page first loads?
[01:53:04] <moijk_> looks the same in safari as in the others by the way
[01:53:40] <moijk_> unnu: have you yet posted any pastebin/jsfiddle/whatever?
[01:53:50] <unnu> jsfiddle
[01:53:57] <unnu> lemme find it again
[01:56:13] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/9uHqw/2/
[01:57:42] <unnu> ive tried formData() ive tried serializeArray()
[01:57:57] <unnu> idk
[01:57:58] <GoSox> mmm cereal
[01:58:22] <unnu> GoSox, i will stab you in teh feet
[01:58:28] <unnu> so your white sox will be red
[01:58:37] <GoSox> my sox are already red
[01:58:42] <unnu> fine
[01:58:51] <GoSox> smarten up!
[01:58:52] <GoSox> B
[01:58:55] <unnu> ill drown you in bleach
[01:59:02] <unnu> ??
[01:59:18] <unnu> j/ks btw
[01:59:22] <GoSox> before you do that, is click() the best event to use for clicking a button, or is there another event for button clicks
[01:59:44] <unnu> submit?
[01:59:49] <unnu> wait, my code or yours?
[01:59:52] <GoSox> mine :)
[01:59:56] <unnu> ahhh
[02:00:00] <unnu> submit?
[02:00:00] <unnu> lol
[02:00:05] <unnu> j/k j/k
[02:00:07] <ryorky1> any idea why I'm getting an Uncaught Syntax: Unexpected token ILLEGAL error?  here is a quick pastie:  http://pastie.org/7967350
[02:00:08] <GoSox> i was going to help you but then you suggested i was a white sox fan and i lost interest
[02:00:09] <unnu> didn't even look at it
[02:00:51] <Cork> ryorky1: check for unprintable characters
[02:01:10] <Cork> you prob have an invalid space at the beginning or end of a line
[02:01:17] <xec_> ryorky1: you can't have multiline strings in js
[02:01:45] <Cork> oh
[02:01:50] <Cork> missed that part
[02:01:53] <xec_> ryorky1: (or rather, you can, but not like that, and i suggest you avoid it) ;)
[02:02:12] <ryorky1> xec_: does js have a delimiter that allows you to break a long line of code into multiple lines?
[02:02:46] <xec_> ryorky1: yes, you can escape the newline with a backslash, but i suggest you don't do that (very hard to debug later)
[02:02:48] <Cork> ryorky1: http://jsfiddle.net/twTp7/
[02:02:55] <Cork> true
[02:03:17] <Cork> i like using arrays for things like that
[02:03:22] <Cork> normally makes it nice to read
[02:03:25] <xec_> ryorky1: either remove the line breaks in the string, or concatenate strings
[02:03:31] <xec_> arrays are nice too
[02:03:33] <Cork> ['', '', '', '', ''].join()
[02:03:36] <Cork> ['', '', '', '', ''].join('')
[02:03:36] <ryorky1> xec_:  tnx
[02:04:17] <unnu> Cork, im sorry if i offended you earlier, i was frustrated and venting
[02:04:27] <ryorky1> xec_ wouldn't creating an array create unnecessary overhead
[02:04:28] <ryorky1> ?
[02:04:59] <xec_> ryorky1: as would concatenation, but it's negligible
[02:05:16] <xec_> sp?
[02:05:37] <xec_> i got it right!? /flex
[02:06:01] <ryorky1> xec_, Cork: tnx guys
[02:07:17] <Cork> browsers often optimize common code flows too
[02:07:29] <Cork> so what the js engine actually does doens't have to be a real array
[02:08:26] <Cork> but ya, if you do it A LOT in a tight loop, that results in the browsers gc getting hard to keep up you don't want to use an array
[02:08:35] <Cork> cause then you end up with a memory baloon
[02:09:35] <Cork> (on the other hand, if you're at that point, there is commonly other parts that is even bigger causes to gc)
[02:10:04] <xec_> more likely, in ryorky1's case, it's a one-time operation
[02:10:12] <Cork> ya
[02:11:09] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/UGUQp/
[02:12:04] <xec_> unnu: did you have a question (that i missed)?
[02:12:16] <unnu> about 5
[02:12:22] <unnu> but nahh its okay
[02:12:28] <unnu> ive pissed cork off already
[02:12:34] <unnu> best not make anyone else mad
[02:12:43] <unnu> ive only been working on this for 8 hours now
[02:13:10] <screamingbanshee> how did you piss off Cork? that
[02:13:13] <screamingbanshee> 's hard to do
[02:13:16] <xec_> well, it is quite unlikely that anyone is going to answer a question unless a question is asked
[02:13:50] <xec_> (at least that's what konfucious with a K would say)
[02:13:52] <unnu> im trying to send a form's information to a php $_POST variable using jquery's ajax method,
[02:14:50] <xec_> unnu: there is no $.ajax() call in the code you posted...?
[02:15:09] <unnu> yeah, i stripped it out so i could explain
[02:15:39] <xec_> ?submit @ unnu
[02:15:41] <bot-t> unnu, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[02:15:47] <xec_> ?serialize @ unnu
[02:15:47] <bot-t> unnu, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:16:04] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/UGUQp/1/
[02:16:28] <unnu> the html is what is sent back after the bottom ajax call
[02:16:50] <unnu> for some reason when i call the form, it is empty in the dom
[02:17:01] <unnu> so when i serialize() its empty
[02:17:16] <xec_> unnu: read those two pages (thoroughly) and try again, then get back to us if you can't get it working
[02:17:22] <unnu> is it beacuse the form isn't on the page when it loads?
[02:17:34] <xec_> (you are using neither methods in that snippet)
[02:18:10] <unnu> im using .on because .submit wouldnt load because the content wasn't on teh page yet so it didn't get put in the dom
[02:18:36] <xec_> unnu: .on("submit" ...
[02:19:29] <xec_> but the information on the .submit() page is still useful
[02:20:10] <unnu> yeah, im sure
[02:20:11] <unnu> :P
[02:21:51] <unnu> alright, changed to "submit" and puttng serialize back in
[02:23:10] <unnu> button doesn't work when it is submit
[02:23:27] <xec_> did you read the docs
[02:24:42] <unnu> yup
[02:24:52] <xec_> what did you bind the submit to
[02:25:44] <unnu> $.(#addform')
[02:25:51] <unnu> $.('#addform') *
[02:27:14] <xec_> unnu: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/UGUQp/2/
[02:28:14] <xec_> i took the liberty of fixing the html too, <form> is not a valid child of <table>
[02:28:30] <unnu> i forgot a damn semicolon
[02:28:45] <xec_> 10 bucks says it's not the semicolon's fault
[02:28:48] <unnu> ive been up for about 30 hours
[02:28:58] <GoSox> wait, where are the NTFL police?
[02:29:12] <unnu> i just started learning javascript, let alone jquery
[02:29:21] <xec_> unnu: the code i just posted would do the exact same thing without a single semicolon
[02:29:37] <xec_> unnu: demo http://jsfiddle.net/UGUQp/3/
[02:29:57] <unnu> i have medical problems, so coding is all i got to do for the next few months
[02:30:00] <unnu> if im lucky
[02:30:05] <unnu> so thanks
[02:31:45] <xec_> i'm off to lunch, gl unnu
[02:31:50] <unnu> k
[02:35:53] <unnu> shit
[02:35:57] <unnu> code still doesn't work
[02:36:08] <unnu> im almost positive its because of the way im loading the form on the page
[02:36:32] <unnu> and i can't post ajax anywhere without showing you guys the actual site, which id rather not do
[02:48:03] <ryorky1> how can I retrieve the style of a span impeded inside the first td of a tr?  here is my pastie:  http://pastie.org/7967537
[02:48:24] <FrameFever> has anybody experience with preloaded images?
[02:48:35] <FrameFever> or better load images on demand
[02:48:57] <ryorky1> xec_:  any ideas?
[02:49:17] <Cork> ryorky1: $('tr td span.indeter').css('padding-left')
[02:49:32] <Cork> or if you want the undecoded string $('tr td span.indeter').attr('style')
[02:50:16] <ryorky1> Cork, it's dynamic and there are multiple trs on the page
[02:50:25] <ryorky1> will that make a difference?
[02:51:05] <Cork> ryorky1: you want it in relation to what?
[02:51:14] <Cork> FrameFever: preload and on demand is almost exactly the opposite of each other
[02:51:23] <Cork> FrameFever: so, what is it you want to do
[02:51:27] <ryorky1> Cork:  I figured I needed to use $(this)  something
[02:51:52] <Cork> ryorky1: you want to loop the tr's and do something based on it or what?
[02:51:59] <Cork> or is it a click event or...?
[02:52:08] <ryorky1> Cork:  in relation to the .newfolder button that is clicked
[02:52:19] <ryorky1> Cork:  click
[02:52:45] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').find('.indenter')
[02:53:52] <ryorky1> that's why I was using parent and then trying to move down the DOM
[02:54:07] <ryorky1> Cork:  ahhh, you are a lifesaver, tnx so much
[02:54:32] <ryorky1> I'm trying to learn, but it just takes a while, LOL
[02:54:34] <FrameFever> Cork: load on demand
[02:54:49] <Cork> FrameFever: that is what the browser does by default
[02:54:57] <FrameFever> When the user clicks a button the image should be loaded
[02:55:08] <unnu> Cork, im super sorry if i made you mad.
[02:55:11] <FrameFever> and I want to get informed when it is loaded
[02:55:16] <FrameFever> even when it is cached
[03:08:23] <unnu> after i serialize a form, how would i append data to it?
[03:09:46] <unnu> var form_Data = $(this).serialize(); $("form_Data").append("anotherfeild", "anothervalue");
[03:09:51] <unnu> ^^^ like that?
[03:41:36] <xec_> unnu: nope. serialize generates a string. maybe what you want is a hidden input?
[03:41:50] <unnu> sure
[03:41:58] <unnu> can i send a file with that?
[03:42:07] <unnu> or serializearray ?
[03:42:12] <xec_> what?
[03:42:17] <xec_> what are you really trying to do
[03:42:27] <unnu> i want to upload a file and some text feilds
[03:43:06] <xec_> <input type="file"> ?
[03:43:18] <Cork> ?g mdn filereader
[03:43:23] <b-ot> Cork: FileReader - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[03:43:31] <xec_> probably not going to work with serialize..
[03:43:35] <RefactorNinja> I'm writing a re-usable web widget that you include with just a script tag and one or more divs where it should be inserted, so I'm being very careful about not polluting the global name-space and using $.noConflict to restore the previous global $ variable. However, I'd also like to load a jquery extension, but there is now no global jquery object for the extension to extend. Help!
[03:44:13] <unnu> okay
[03:44:25] <unnu> so if serialize wont work
[03:44:43] <unnu> cork, was that link for me?
[03:48:16] <xec_> unnu: i don't have any experience with file uploads via ajax myself, but this looks relevant http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5513485/form-serialize-workaround-for-file-fields
[03:49:00] <screamingbanshee> somebody's trying to do file uploads? sorry wasn't paying attn
[03:49:26] <unnu> yeah
[03:49:27] <screamingbanshee> serialize won't work, no. the file needs to use FileData
[03:49:40] <unnu> okay
[03:50:06] <screamingbanshee> er, FormData rather
[03:50:37] <screamingbanshee> (this is very much so a pain, I'll warn you now)
[03:50:38] <unnu> i figured
[03:50:50] <screamingbanshee> but it can be done - ajax file upload, amirite?
[03:51:18] <unnu> i asked earlier and Cork said serialize was the way to go, i didn't realize the file input tag would make a difference
[03:51:54] <screamingbanshee> yes, it changes everything. I've never seen Cork be wrong about anything.
[03:52:24] <screamingbanshee> for one thing, you will need to retrieve the file on the backend with $_FILES if you're using php, for example.
[03:52:38] <unnu> i know that
[03:52:47] <unnu> ive uploaded files in php before
[03:52:54] <unnu> im quite alright when it comes to php
[03:52:58] <motaka2> unnu: Can you see my PMS?
[03:53:05] <unnu> nope
[03:53:11] <motaka2> Does anyone sees my messages?
[03:53:17] <motaka2> unnu: Ok
[03:53:59] <screamingbanshee> motaka2 - I see them here in the channel, yeah
[03:54:05] <unnu> anyway
[03:54:09] <unnu> var form_Data = new FormData($(this)[0]);   ?
[03:54:15] <motaka2> screamingbanshee: Thx
[03:54:17] <screamingbanshee> @unnu - the setup for ajax file upload is extremely specific
[03:55:02] <unnu> im assuming asyc:false, contentType: false and process data:false
[03:55:26] <xec_> ?async
[03:55:27] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[03:55:30] <screamingbanshee> you don't need the async:false
[03:56:52] <unnu> oh
[03:56:53] <unnu> okay
[03:56:57] <unnu> LOL
[03:57:41] <screamingbanshee> you will want to create a FormData object and append the FileList object's first index to it
[03:59:33] <unnu> can i not pass it directly into the FormData function?
[04:00:06] <screamingbanshee> I don't remember perfectly, I want to say yes
[04:01:27] <screamingbanshee> but if not, method is .append(FileList obj[0])
[04:02:06] <unnu> gotcha
[04:02:17] <unnu> tested it out
[04:02:36] <unnu> i can pass it directly in with $(this)[0]
[04:03:02] <screamingbanshee> Look through the form object for the FileList object, and you'll find an array of objects, there'll only be 1 but it will have 5 properties
[04:03:06] <screamingbanshee> yeah
[04:03:06] <unnu> and then i just have to .append("extratitle", "extra values"); right?
[04:03:40] <unnu> and it has props of name, size, templocation, and other stuffs
[04:03:47] <unnu> i saw
[04:03:48] <screamingbanshee> yep those 5
[04:03:56] <unnu> yeah
[04:04:02] <unnu> i think i got it working
[04:04:09] <screamingbanshee> cool
[04:04:26] <unnu> lemme just print_r($_FILES); real quick
[04:04:32] <motaka2> using this code: http://pastebin.com/C9xJW0DQ I try to get input values of a form with a given action but it doesnt work , can you tell me what th eproblem is?
[04:05:06] <screamingbanshee> it should be in $_FILES['extratitle'] I believe
[04:05:33] <screamingbanshee> (according to your example above)
[04:06:55] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/gQKuA/
[04:07:22] <screamingbanshee> you would put in like, .append(file.name, file);
[04:08:08] <screamingbanshee> or whatever you want it to show up in the $_FILES array as. it should contain a multidimensional array of the file object
[04:08:17] <unnu> oh, it does
[04:08:20] <screamingbanshee> cool
[04:08:23] <screamingbanshee> you're golden
[04:08:34] <screamingbanshee> :D
[04:08:41] <motaka2> no one cares for me?
[04:09:11] <unnu> thanks screaming banshee, motaka2 wants to do something simillar i think
[04:09:49] <screamingbanshee> sorry motaka2 I'm not as cool as Cork ;) I can only help 1 at a time ;) what did you need to do?
[04:10:20] <motaka2> screamingbanshee: You are great. Here is my question :  	using this code: http://pastebin.com/C9xJW0DQ I try to get input values of a form with a given action but it doesnt work , can you tell me what th eproblem is?
[04:11:40] <screamingbanshee> yeah, overkill :) were you the one with the DOM propogation issue?
[04:12:49] <motaka2> screamingbanshee: maybe, I dont remember , but the form is injected in content-in via ajax
[04:12:59] <screamingbanshee> motaka2, are you trying to do ajax file upload, or just regular ajax form submit?
[04:13:17] <screamingbanshee> ok, so yes that was you
[04:13:23] <motaka2> no, I just try to see form values in my javascript files
[04:14:09] <screamingbanshee> ok. In order to bind any kind of listener to injected elements, those elements must exist in the DOM at the time you try to bind
[04:14:24] <motaka2> the code shows that when a form is submited, i want to gather it's input names-values , but It seems fieldNamesValues are empty
[04:14:30] <screamingbanshee> (this is very important)
[04:14:43] <screamingbanshee> ok.
[04:14:55] <motaka2> screamingbanshee: They exist
[04:15:30] <screamingbanshee> motaka2, I will msg you
[04:15:32] <motaka2> because first I get the whole form, then I click on submit button
[04:15:44] <motaka2> thank you
[04:15:54] <BulleTTime> hey guys, anyone knows why jquery returns 0 with .height on a div that actualy has a height of more than 0???
[04:16:08] <BulleTTime> i fill this div with stuff inside php
[04:16:29] <miCSu> are the contents already loaded?
[04:16:39] <BulleTTime> it always returns 0, inside chrome and ie10
[04:17:00] <miCSu> is it inside $(document).ready or such?
[04:17:18] <BulleTTime> ive read that it should be inside $(window).load(function () {
[04:17:34] <BulleTTime> but also in $(document).ready it returns 0
[04:17:35] <miCSu> well, something like that
[04:17:44] <BulleTTime> or &(function)
[04:17:49] <BulleTTime> no one works
[04:18:04] <BulleTTime> $(function) {
[04:18:17] <miCSu> probably some css sets of the div
[04:18:40] <BulleTTime> hhm no when i wrap a extra div, without any css it also returns 0
[04:18:47] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I just changed my code from directly accessing data-attributes to using data(). However, I realised that it does not directly access the attributes. Now I'm a bit in trouble since I use selectors like [data-blah-id] a lot... Are there any other data-based selectors? Thanks in advance for any pointers :-)
[04:19:41] <BulleTTime> i have had this issue before miCSu, it seems to be a browser bug?
[04:19:48] <BulleTTime> or jquery?\
[04:20:20] <miCSu> have you got it working in some browser
[04:20:21] <miCSu> ?
[04:20:55] <BulleTTime> nope it aint work in chrome and also not inside ie 10, i quess all other modern browsers do the same
[04:20:57] <miCSu> I'd probably use browser inspectors to check out if there's any difference in the computed styles of the element
[04:21:08] <BulleTTime> i use that
[04:21:19] <miCSu> what about compatibility mode in ie
[04:21:35] <BulleTTime> the inspector in chrome always shows the correct height and width!
[04:21:52] <BulleTTime> ill check compatibility mode now
[04:22:40] <BulleTTime> no miCSu not any mode returns correct height value
[04:22:49] <BulleTTime> its always 0
[04:23:40] <Cork> BulleTTime: is the element an inline element?
[04:24:14] <BulleTTime> well, i have wrapped a div around the content, without any css applied, so its not inline\
[04:24:31] <Cork> 2. have you added it to the document yet?, 3. is it's parents visible (not display:none)
[04:25:11] <BulleTTime> Cork , its just data created with php echo's
[04:25:26] <Cork> and no css anywhere?
[04:25:32] <BulleTTime> well yes
[04:25:36] <unnu> [07:25:08.154] TypeError: $(...).files is undefined
[04:25:47] <BulleTTime> but not ON the wrapper div
[04:25:55] <Cork> and not on a parent?
[04:26:06] <BulleTTime> yes much of parents
[04:26:20] <Cork> then make sure none of the parents has display: none;
[04:26:29] <Cork> as in the parent chain
[04:26:29] <BulleTTime> hhm
[04:26:31] <unnu> dangit, my test page works, but not my actual one
[04:26:55] <BulleTTime> well Cork i actualy need the height to fix my custom scrollbar
[04:27:14] <BulleTTime> so i have a jquery code that does things with div
[04:27:45] <BulleTTime> can i show the code?
[04:27:54] <Cork> sure
[04:27:55] <Cork> ?p
[04:27:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:28:04] <Cork> BulleTTime: the reason i ask all those questions, is cause each of them is falls into reflow optimizations the browsers does
[04:28:15] <BulleTTime> aha
[04:28:28] <Cork> and those things cause the element to not be part of the reflow, and cause of that; it doesn't get any calculated width or height
[04:29:03] <Cork> *each of them falls into
[04:30:41] <BulleTTime> ok i used jsbin
[04:30:43] <BulleTTime> http://jsbin.com/ovuwen/1/edit
[04:31:11] <BulleTTime> on the bottom i have the alert that shows the height of the div
[04:36:48] <paulens12> hello
[04:36:48] <Cork> BulleTTime: ui-accordion-accordion-panel-1 has display:none;padding:0;border:0
[04:37:04] <Cork> BulleTTime: so ya, a parent excludes the element from reflow
[04:37:06] <paulens12> http://pastebin.com/5pRCmM75 when i move my mouse out of #login, it doesn't close. what's wrong with my code?
[04:37:42] <Cork> ?p @ paulens12
[04:37:42] <bot-t> paulens12, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:37:46] <Cork> and include your html too
[04:38:05] <Cork> (and make sure the parts runs)
[04:38:23] <paulens12> eh...
[04:38:45] <Cork> basically make a demo of the problem
[04:39:15] <paulens12> yeah, well, i just have two divs one on another
[04:39:16] <paulens12> umm
[04:39:24] <paulens12> take a look: 78.56.132.80/web
[04:39:38] <paulens12> http://78.56.132.80/web
[04:40:16] <paulens12> here's html: http://pastebin.com/1k8dd7m8
[04:41:08] <Cork> your login is outside the prelogin
[04:41:23] <paulens12> yeah
[04:41:24] <paulens12> so?
[04:41:33] <seutje> paulens12: ur jquery dependent script is trying to run before jquery does
[04:41:45] <paulens12> ummm
[04:41:49] <paulens12> what does that mean? xD
[04:41:55] <paulens12> it's the only script in my page
[04:42:00] <paulens12> there are no other scripts there
[04:42:23] <BulleTTime> hhm but that style display:none is set by the accordion code from jquery Cork
[04:42:29] <Cork> paulens12:  the script headers is in the wrong order
[04:42:29] <seutje> lies
[04:42:36] <Cork> move jquery to the top script line
[04:42:38] <seutje> 	<script src="scr/index.js"></script>		<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[04:42:54] <BulleTTime> because when i remove it from the index.php it still got applied
[04:42:54] <Cork> BulleTTime: yes
[04:43:09] <paulens12> ohhh!!!
[04:43:11] <paulens12> thanks! :D
[04:43:23] <Cork> BulleTTime: i only said that is the cause
[04:43:32] <BulleTTime> aaaah
[04:43:36] <Cork> BulleTTime: what you most likely need to do
[04:43:42] <BulleTTime> count?
[04:43:55] <Cork> is move the code that updates the scrollbar, to when the accordian shows the element
[04:43:59] <Cork> *element
[04:44:02] <seutje> paulens12: as a side note: probably should use a text input for passwords, consider using a password input ;)
[04:44:09] <seutje> shouldn't
[04:44:26] <Cork> heh you made be flinch there :)
[04:44:42] <Cork> "why should you use a text field for password" :P
[04:47:23] <paulens12> seutje: it's just a test page ;D there's no php yet... but thanks for noticing :D
[04:47:42] <seutje> Cork: shaddap :P
[04:47:53] <seutje> it's monday, sue me!
[04:47:56] <paulens12> lol
[04:48:05] <Cork> :)
[04:58:38] <BulleTTime> thanks Cork, that did the trick!
[05:03:58] <lejocelyn> Hi, I don't understand why my $.ajax  script don't evaluate empty json object as a success.
[05:04:41] <lejocelyn> (in my script, I have then : success: function(answer){if(answer){return true;}else{return false;}}
[05:04:46] <lejocelyn> )
[05:04:57] <lejocelyn> but it's not being executed
[05:07:35] <Lucaszz> hi
[05:07:56] <Lucaszz> How is the best practice to use inputs, forms with dialog boxes
[05:07:57] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:09:54] <Cork> Lucaszz: not sure i understand the question; but yes you should always have a form around inputs
[05:10:22] <Cork> lejocelyn: return in the success callback makes no sense
[05:10:39] <Lucaszz> now when im putting inputs into dialog box
[05:11:04] <Cork> now when?
[05:11:06] <Lucaszz> I have to appendTo dialog box inside form after open
[05:11:44] <lejocelyn> Cork: really ? what's wrong with it ?
[05:11:48] <Lucaszz> (jquery ui-dialog delegates div with dialog at the end of html)
[05:12:06] <Cork> lejocelyn: what is the return meant to do?
[05:12:23] <Cork> lejocelyn: your just returning true or false to $.ajax, and it doesn't care
[05:13:43] <paulens12> damn... i know i'm very annoying, but i have one more little problem xD
[05:13:45] <lejocelyn> Cork: here's the whole function : http://pastebin.fr/27537
[05:14:15] <Cork> lejocelyn: wait, you want to control a submit event or something like that?
[05:14:21] <lejocelyn> yes
[05:14:34] <Cork> ok, then you can't do it like you are
[05:14:40] <lejocelyn> arg
[05:14:41] <Cork> first skip using return
[05:14:46] <paulens12> ah... nevermind xD
[05:14:49] <Cork> use event.preventDefault()
[05:14:57] <lejocelyn> I already do that
[05:15:10] <Cork> and in the callback from the scrubber event form.submit()
[05:15:20] <lejocelyn> it's not really a submit button, just a button
[05:15:21] <seutje> what's the point of returning a value from a ajax success handler?
[05:15:21] <Cork> where form is the dom element NOT the jquery wrapped element
[05:15:35] <Cork> seutje: none
[05:15:59] <seutje> lejocelyn: ^
[05:16:20] <Cork> lejocelyn: remember that ajax is async, so you can't return anything from those
[05:16:34] <dumbdell> hey Cork
[05:16:36] <lejocelyn> true
[05:16:36] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/136/
[05:16:40] <lejocelyn> I understand
[05:18:03] <Cork> dumbdell: ah, it's taking shape
[05:18:30] <Cork> (except it's still webkit sentric...)
[05:19:12] <ravenzz> is it possible to fire more than one event with trigger() ? like $foo.trigger("foo bar")
[05:19:13] <ravenzz> ?
[05:19:13] <dumbdell> yeah i got compatibilty for webkit/moz/opera but IE10 didnt install on my machine when it updated to sp1 for some reason
[05:19:56] <Cork> dumbdell: moz is dead in the water here
[05:19:57] <dumbdell> Cork i was going to ask you help with the $.extend prefix code
[05:20:01] <Qdest> So using .on('change'…) on an input doesn't really work that well. One has to remove focus from the input for the change to fire. However, using keyup instead won't fire if someone selects a value from the list presented by the browser/OS..
[05:20:15] <Cork> dumbdell: ok, what about it?
[05:20:24] <Qdest> So what do I use to detect /changes/ to an input ?
[05:20:28] <dumbdell> really hm strange seems to working for me on 12.x
[05:20:33] <seutje> ravenzz: docs suggest it doesn't
[05:20:46] <dumbdell> ah and there is another issue where some times the clock wont start that seems to effect all browsers
[05:20:47] <seutje> Qdest: change
[05:21:11] <seutje> Qdest:  $('form').on('change', 'input', function() { ... });
[05:21:13] <Cork> dumbdell: ff12 has been eol for ages
[05:21:43] <Cork> dumbdell: active firefox versions is ff17 and ff21 (soon ff22)
[05:21:48] <dumbdell> yeah hah lol thats what happens when you down grade your sata hdd to hdd from about 1 year+ ago
[05:21:54] <ravenzz> seutje yeah I was afraid of that
[05:22:24] <lolmaus> .css('left') returns px values though percentages are used. How do i retrieve percentage values?
[05:22:39] <Cork> dumbdell: anyway what was the question about the prefixes?
[05:22:53] <Qdest> seutje » that doesn't seem to fire unless I switch focus from the input. So basically while typing in the input, nothin gets fired. But if I "click" outside the input or tab, the change event fires and things hapopen.
[05:22:57] <Qdest> happen*
[05:23:19] <seutje> Qdest: depends on the browser, some need some keyUp massage
[05:23:27] <dumbdell> Cork I triend to expand the original $.extend prefixs code to have more then one css property, but I just ran into syntax errors when i tried to add the new code block
[05:23:34] <seutje> for a regular text input, it always works afaik
[05:23:57] <Qdest> It does not work unless I switch focus for me, latest Chrome
[05:24:05] <Cork> dumbdell: http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/137/
[05:24:12] <seutje> Qdest: bind to change and keyup and throttle
[05:24:30] <Qdest> How can I bind multiple events?
[05:24:36] <seutje> wait, lemme rephrase: bind to change/keyup, and then throttle
[05:24:51] <seutje> Qdest: docs say u can use space separated list of event types
[05:24:57] <Qdest> .on('change keyup' ?
[05:25:01] <Qdest> oh, right thanks.
[05:27:27] <newtothis> guys, am i doing something fundamentally wrong? i'm try to catch the onClick event for the first thing up the dom, for which i have a handler ready ( http://jsfiddle.net/Vjwqz/ )
[05:28:22] <ravenzz> seutje how bad is this in your opinion http://jsfiddle.net/qacvJ/ ?
[05:28:31] <ravenzz> or good :p
[05:30:00] <dumbdell> tnx Cork
[05:30:26] <newtothis> if i specify that i want to catch for mrow then it works, but i want to be able to respond for anything that has an id :/
[05:30:56] <dumbdell> i never thought to try comma seperate them dohh!
[05:30:56] <seutje> ravenzz: events[evt] isn't always gonna be what u think it will be
[05:31:12] <seutje> ravenzz: if u had more than just click in there, it would always be the last
[05:31:37] <ravenzz> seutje should I wrap it in an iife?
[05:31:40] <seutje> event gets bound, loop continues, variable in scope changes
[05:32:09] <seutje> ravenzz: replacing evt with e.type should work
[05:32:21] <seutje> as then it depends on the event being fired, not the last being bound
[05:32:59] <dumbdell> Cork there is still some screwy going on when the clocks animation is initialisation like i say and also there is some reeally screwy going on with the unit of time that .css() updates the DOM with
[05:33:07] <ravenzz> seutje wait evt is a property of events
[05:33:22] <ravenzz> ah right
[05:33:29] <ravenzz> let me try that
[05:33:36] <seutje> ravenzz: yeah, but ur looping over it, bounding event and then using the same variable in the handler, by which time the loop has continued
[05:33:59] <seutje> also, array.forEach isn't supported in some older browsers, so u should prolly check/polyfill for it
[05:34:03] <dumbdell> somthing^
[05:34:25] <ravenzz> seutje I know
[05:34:31] <ravenzz> I already do that
[05:34:44] <seutje> yeah, figured as much
[05:37:59] <newtothis> oh my problems was that the listener was only being set on the moo div... can i use $('#moo').on('click', ???, function (e) {...}); to listent to all the content of #moo?
[05:37:59] <ravenzz> seutje oh and probably I should check if e.type is in events[e.type]
[05:38:26] <ravenzz> and remove it
[05:38:39] <seutje> ravenzz: well, that should always be the case, since that's the object used to bind the handler
[05:38:42] <ravenzz> or namespace it
[05:48:40] <newtothis> also, is the following a correct way to get a "gensym" (not world-unique, just sequential),   this.gensym = (function () {var gs = 0; return function () { return 'g' + gs++; }; }());  ? (just making sure i understand scoping here)
[05:53:57] <seutje> newtothis: afaict, yeah
[05:54:34] <seutje> the idea being that every time u call gensym() u get the next increment of the same number
[05:55:02] <lemonsparrow> is there a way I can write the same in jQuery ? var [a, b, c] = "27-05-2013".split('-');
[05:55:40] <seutje> that's a bit of a silly question
[05:55:55] <seutje> jQuery is not a language
[05:56:10] <AAlien> i have question about jquery.panzoom plugin (https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom), is this the place to ask?
[05:56:12] <seutje> it does not provide anything that isn't already natively up to par
[05:57:18] <newtothis> seutje, yes that's what i wanted it to do, i just got a little confused about scope of vars in js, thanks!
[05:57:21] <seutje> AAlien: sure, but no guarantee anyone will be able to help
[05:57:30] <lemonsparrow> seutje: is there a jquery API ?
[05:57:36] <seutje> `jqapi
[05:57:55] <AAlien> the default while zooming seems to be to zoom towards to image center, but i'd like to zoom towards the current location of the cursor
[05:57:57] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com
[05:58:34] <AAlien> the plugin does have a "middle" option that (reading from source) takes pageX and pageY, but i can't seem to get it working
[05:58:39] <AAlien> broken example: http://jsfiddle.net/m7rEx/
[05:59:03] <seutje> AAlien: that would either require some logic to adjust the position whilst zooming, or you'd have to translate the origin and apply the reverse to the position right before zooming
[05:59:25] <newtothis> sorry to repeat the question from before, but can i do $('.moo').on('click', ??? , ...) to capture all click events on everything within class moo, somehow?
[05:59:45] <newtothis> (without setting up separate listeners for everything)
[06:00:04] <seutje> AAlien: use rawgithub.com instead of raw.github.com when using github as a CDN, that way the mime type will match
[06:00:38] <AAlien> right
[06:01:03] <AAlien> http://jsfiddle.net/m7rEx/1/
[06:07:06] <AAlien> blah, time to go home ->
[06:07:18] <enerel> what is the easy and recent form validation methods? i have not been around last 2 years
[06:17:56] <vst332> hm now thats a interesting thing moz.. has define KEYFRAMES_RULE and MOZ_KEYFRAMES_RULE in the CSSRule object
[06:18:56] <vst332> in the older version they never did that
[06:19:30] <vst332> so i think that tells me modern moz does not need to be prefixed at all
[06:19:59] <vst332> thus making W3C compatible
[06:21:44] <vst332> god this vendor prefixing really turned out to be a shitty stew :)
[06:22:03] <Iszak> vst332 agreed, atleast it's improvingi.
[06:25:43] <vst332> thankfully $.prefixs can deal with the case
[06:26:29] <krad> how to get all click events on a matching item
[06:26:33] <motaka2> Cork: Are you there?
[06:28:44] <Lucaszz> has every one heard about "ajaxSubmit" method
[06:28:45] <Lucaszz> ?
[06:29:33] <tra> i guess not all of us have
[06:30:04] <j3lte> no not really, why you ask?
[06:36:54] <Lucaszz> j3lte: For example. I have the form. I want to send it. without reload. I prevented submit action. So now I should send the post data via ajax. I dont want to geting every field from my form and then build an Post array. Maybe is any automatically way to get all values from form ?
[06:37:23] <j3lte> serializeForm()
[06:37:25] <j3lte> ?
[06:37:47] <j3lte> atleast, that is what I would use in this case.
[06:40:19] <Lucaszz> j3lte:  Thank you

[06:45:43] <alexidoia> Hello, I am using .ajax() to retrieve some html and to assign it to a div, thing is, how do I wait for the html to arrive before assigning it to the div ?
[06:48:21] <obert> hello, is there a plugin or similar to get a thing like facebook tagging system?
[06:49:02] <alexidoia> I don't understand how to wait for the result of an ajax before using the result
[06:49:06] <alexidoia> anyone ?
[06:49:58] <newtothis> alexidoia, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5354641/how-can-i-get-make-javascript-code-execution-to-wait-until-an-ajax-request-with
[06:52:09] <Aqwis4> hey, JS noob here
[06:52:17] <Aqwis4> why doesn't this work? http://pastebin.ca/2383172 alert just says "undefined"
[06:52:36] <Aqwis4> if I put alert into the inner function I get object.Object
[06:53:41] <newtothis> alexidoia, actually jquery seems to have $.when that'd be great for it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6250022/waiting-for-jquery-ajax-responses ^_^*
[06:53:44] <Iszak> newtothis that's for ExtJS.
[06:54:00] <Iszak> alexidoia you'd bind your callback to the success callback, by then the HTML will be received.
[06:54:32] <alexidoia> newtothis: ok thanks to all of you
[06:55:13] <Iszak> Aqwis4 it's because the AJAX call is asynchronous, so you don't have access to settings at that point, you'll have access to it in the callback.
[06:55:53] <obert> i mean the tagging system over a photo
[06:56:00] <Aqwis4> hmm
[06:56:14] <Aqwis4> so how can I properly load a json file containing settings so that the rest of the javascript that's executed has access to the settings?
[06:56:24] <Iszak> obert almost certainly.
[06:56:38] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[06:57:16] <Iszak> Aqwis4  well the rest of your application can be wrapped in a function which can be called after the AJAX request.
[06:57:58] <Aqwis4> is that even possible to do when it's spread over several files?
[06:58:03] <jonathancutrell> I know this isn't the place to solicit for jobs - is there a place that is "officially" supported by the jQuery team?
[06:58:48] <Iszak> Aqwis4 so if you're loading multiple JSON files, then you'd want to use promises like newtothis demonstrated in their most recently posted link.
[06:59:05] <jedimind> jonathanochs, i dont think there's a jquery specific and sanctioned channel for that
[06:59:18] <Aqwis4> I'm just loading one json
[06:59:25] <jedimind> jonathanochs, there is #css-lance which is a place to find freelancers that focus primarily on front end development including some strong jquery people
[06:59:30] <Aqwis4> but the settings contained in that json are used by various js files
[06:59:30] <jedimind> but that's about it afaik
[06:59:31] <obert> Iszak: do you get some links to give me, please?
[07:00:24] <Iszak> obert I cannot refer one I've used specifically, no. But something like "jquery photo tagging" will render some results, unless I don't understand your request.
[07:00:31] <jonathancutrell> jedimind: I'm assuming you were talking to me? :)
[07:00:38] <Iszak> jedimind good to see you're still active.
[07:01:00] <jonathancutrell> jedimind: And, thank you for the info.
[07:01:07] <Iszak> Aqwis4 if you're only loading one, then just have a callback function which runs the rest of your application.
[07:01:11] <obert> Iszak: http://jquerybyexample.blogspot.com/2012/12/top-jquery-photo-image-tagging-plugins.html first result
[07:01:21] <Iszak> Yeah, I saw that as well.
[07:01:27] <jedimind> jonathancutrell no problem :) and yeah apparently i cant nick complete first thing on monday morning
[07:01:28] <obert> why didnt i think about photo tagging keyword
[07:01:41] <jonathancutrell> jedimind: Heh. I know the feeling.
[07:02:17] <obert> Iszak: thanks
[07:03:58] <Aqwis4> Iszak: but I don't see how I could do that in a reasonable way
[07:04:06] <Aqwis4> without having to put everything inside a function which is called
[07:04:36] <Iszak> Aqwis4 this is async for you.
[07:04:53] <Aqwis4> sigh
[07:05:04] <Aqwis4> is there a way to parse a JSON file non-asynchronous?
[07:05:14] <Iszak> its' not so much the parsing, but the fetching.
[07:05:20] <Iszak> and yes there is, but I dont' recommend it.
[07:05:25] <newtothis> Aqwis4, maybe you could have a bunch of .init() or .setup() for the different parts and only a simple function calling them all - they don't actually have to be within the same function or anything
[07:05:58] <Iszak> Aqwis4 http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ see option "async" if you must, but remember, the UI is likely to become locked by doing so.
[07:06:32] <newtothis> Iszak, locked, waiting for io with web latency? :D sounds great :)
[07:06:45] <Iszak> it's horrible.
[07:06:49] <Aqwis4> the UI is useless without the settings file, this is an audio player which needs javascript to function
[07:07:16] <Iszak> Aqwis4 still don't recommend it, what if you want it to be doing 2 things at once? and there's only one javascript thread that's being blocked by this.
[07:07:34] <Iszak> or if you want to load multiple JSON files, it can't do them at the same time, it'll be one after the other, which is much slower.
[07:09:28] <vst332> lol Cork .. I am going to have to some how prefix even the units of time by the looks of it.. firefox only understands seconds and webkit only understands millisecs
[07:10:17] <vst332> some one needs a kick in the head at moz/google for that
[07:10:49] <vst332> i solid beat down with the abacus
[07:13:27] <Iszak> vst332 moz/google? what about apple? microsoft?
[07:13:28] <Iszak> opera?
[07:13:45] <Iszak> In fact, if anything Mozilla and Google should be praised for their initiative to resolve this cluster fuck.
[07:34:42] <dumbdell> Rikes
[07:35:06] <dumbdell> hm firefox is corrupting my function argument!
[07:35:48] <dumbdell> firefox wouldnt have a internal variable called sdeg or anything would it?
[07:36:46] <dumbdell> hrm no .. sdeg not defined!"£$!" wtf
[07:43:38] <jonkri> how can i assign some kind of arbitrary state to a jquery element? i'm writing a simple plugin applicable to block elements, and i want to save the plugin settings
[07:44:09] <seutje> jonkri: .data
[07:47:05] <jonkri> seutje: thanks :)
[07:50:59] <alexidoia> I have some code to be executed when the page is ready
[07:51:20] <alexidoia> I used the ready function that is simple
[07:51:28] <newtothis> but $('#moo') !== $('#moo'), right? so that if you add .data to a jquery object, don't expect it to prevail between different lookups
[07:51:56] <alexidoia> but then I need at some point to update the html and I'd like to launched again the code that was executed within the ready function
[07:52:01] <alexidoia> how can I do that ?
[07:52:24] <newtothis> alexidoia, store that code in another functions and jsut call ir onReady and there
[07:52:51] <alexidoia> newtothis: yes the thing is that I am not responsible for the ready function, so I can't touch it
[07:53:20] <alexidoia> I'd like to give the trigger the ready events like if the browser did it
[07:53:34] <newtothis> alexidoia, i'm preety sure you can somehow launch the document.event somehow, i'll look up the syntax
[07:54:03] <alexidoia> that would help me a lot
[07:54:09] <alexidoia> thanks a bunch if you find that
[07:55:22] <ne0h> is it possible to do a ajax post request without compression?
[07:56:00] <ne0h> i read a lot of posts and i'm not sure what to belief
[07:56:34] <newtothis> alexidoia, it seems to me that you can't trigger the ready event because its handler is cleared ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562229/how-to-trigger-ready-in-jquery maybe checkout http://api.jquery.com/ready/ )
[07:56:50] <shoky> newtothis: what you said about .data isn't true. you should definitely expect it to prevail between different lookups, otherwise it'd be useless
[07:56:54] <alexidoia> damn it
[07:57:28] <newtothis> shoky, i just tried $('#moo') !== $('#moo) and it's true
[07:57:31] <shoky> newtothis: in case you were thinking of actually setting a .data field on the jquery object, that wasn't the suggestion
[07:57:36] <shoky> ?data
[07:57:37] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:57:42] <shoky> newtothis: ^ that was the suggestion
[07:57:53] <newtothis> shoky, oh i see! :)
[07:57:55] <shoky> ;]
[08:08:03] <ne0h> is it possible to do a ajax post request without compression?
[08:10:12] <chilversc> ne0h: that's down to the browser and the server, why?
[08:10:40] <ne0h> i have to write a server for a cloudsystem
[08:11:09] <ne0h> with the native clients it works. but jquery does not understand the result
[08:11:51] <chilversc> ne0h: huh?
[08:13:59] <ne0h> i have no idea why ff and chromium do not understand the result
[08:14:24] <ne0h> http://pastebin.com/yKkiANdr
[08:14:29] <ne0h> this is my request
[08:17:58] <Frank____> first come here, try write some words
[08:29:51] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/184/ <-- nearly there .. I discovered something new now as well.. that you have tell the animation to rotate some stupid amount of degrees to keep the animation going .. i thought originaly i could tell the animation to start at what ever degrees then finish at what ever the ending degrees were minus the_amount_offset  being (360deg - start_degree) but like that
[08:29:52] <dumbdell> animations jumps back to the start degrees after 1 revolution  so i duno
[08:33:45] <dumbdell> ^^ and then the problem grows more complex again.. its fine you can tell it stupid amounts of degrees... seeing as no one is going to sit in a webpage stareing at a css3 clock all day any way and the onfocus code will reset the clock again periodically.. it can go for 12 hours on the ridcoulous ending degrees any way .. but the more degrees it has the more you have to increase the amount of
[08:33:45] <dumbdell> time the animation needs
[08:38:09] <dumbdell> Hah i just thought of a sweeet solution
[08:38:14] <dumbdell> rotate the whole clock face

[09:04:13] <aMoniker> jQuery._data(jQuery('a#myelement')[0], "events" ); shows only ONE bound click handler
[09:04:21] <aMoniker> yet the href is still followed

[09:19:34] <shoky> aMoniker:  /*   */   prevents code from running  ;]
[09:19:46] <aMoniker> shoky: Not from within the other click handler it doesn't.
[09:19:58] <abjorn> adding a nice little "fuck you" to the comment would also be appropriate
[09:20:24] <shoky> oh, other = the original?
[09:20:29] <shoky> i mean, not that script
[09:21:24] <aMoniker> shoky: I mean, the jQuery click handler... trying to come up with a hacky emergency fix for the time being
[09:21:28] <newtothis> aMoniker, do you mean in another element? you can catch it there and prevent propogation
[09:21:33] <aMoniker> shoky: Though I'm seeing if I can disable KISS metrics altogether
[09:21:48] <aMoniker> newtothis: it doesn't look like a jquery event handler, unless I'm mistaken
[09:22:18] <newtothis> aMoniker, i'm not sure i understand what you mean either way
[09:23:01] <aMoniker> newtothis: ah right... event functions would work in both cases
[09:23:13] <aMoniker> newtothis: the kiss handler must fire first, set the timeout, then the jquery handler fires
[09:23:21] <aMoniker> so the timeout is still set...
[09:24:26] <newtothis> aMoniker, sorry only programing related thing kiss makes me think of, is keeping it simple... no idea what you're talking about ^^*
[09:24:37] <aMoniker> newtothis: read up :)
[09:24:49] <aMoniker> heh, I need a clearAllTimeouts() to call in the jquery handler
[09:24:53] <aMoniker> this is a clever solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860188/is-there-a-way-to-clear-all-time-outs
[09:24:59] <aMoniker> probably not reliable though
[09:26:42] <shoky> aMoniker:  a workaround is to put target="bla"  on your <a>'s
[09:27:10] <aMoniker> shoky: oh, does the kiss code ignore that, I didn't see that bit
[09:28:06] <shoky> ya.. f && (!f.target && !a.shiftKey && !a.altKey && !a.ctrlKey && !a.metaKey)
[09:28:31] <dumbdell> Cork .. why do i get unexpected identifier from: $.prefixes.animation ?
[09:31:19] <aMoniker> shoky: ah, nice
[09:32:06] <newtothis> how do you guys unpack the js to make it readable? @_@
[09:32:39] <shoky> chrome devtools has a "pretty print" button  { }
[09:32:54] <newtothis> oh @_@
[09:33:04] <aMoniker> hmm, disabling the kiss plugin didn't have an effect..
[09:33:17] <aMoniker> However there are 50 other plugins..
[09:33:49] <shoky> aMoniker: it's not disabled
[09:34:34] <aMoniker> shoky: the KISS metrics plugin is disabled
[09:34:41] <aMoniker> shoky: so some other plugin or hook is adding it
[09:35:29] <shoky> aMoniker: your html has a <script> that's loading it.. _kms('//doug1izaerwt3.cloudfront.net/6a9f8cc5ec32564a8804d15f6f626b662dc617d1.1.js');
[09:35:36] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/192/ <-- works now .. just not with the $.prefixes for some reason ;( .. but it is kind of unescesary any way only webkit is actuallly lagging behind the standards with theier use of "insertRule" instead of "appendRule" and they have not addopted vendorless prefixes
[09:36:46] <aMoniker> shoky: I know, but it's WP so finding what actually adds that is tricky
[09:37:00] <aMoniker> shoky: pulling the theme down so I can grep
[09:38:16] <dumbdell> 1 last side note: additionally webkit thinks they support milliseconds for their animations but really its microseconds .. i guess thats just over sight/typeo in their docs or just a raw dealo bug .. who knows
[09:39:40] <shoky> dumbdell: uhmm microseconds are 1/1000th of a millisecond
[09:40:08] <shoky> i.e. smaller
[09:40:16] <shoky> if you support microseconds.. you support milliseconds
[09:41:54] <dumbdell> heh yea true but they assume you can do 1ms and it will be 1000microsec 1ms = 1microsec not a millisec
[09:42:21] <aMoniker> shoky: Super Cache had cached the kiss plugin
[09:42:29] <aMoniker> shoky: Thanks again for pointing that out - got a donate link?
[09:43:00] <shoky> aMoniker: wordpress always sounds fun. nope no link.. you're welcome ;]
[09:43:33] <aMoniker> shoky: It's only fun when a good developer has built with it... which is rarely.
[09:43:35] <motaka2> does anyone knows why inputs in this code is empty?   http://pastebin.com/7FVg2qAv
[09:44:33] <aMoniker> motaka2: 'form[action="'+action+'"]:input' not 'form[action="'+action+'"] :input'
[09:45:36] <shoky> aMoniker: that doesn't sound right
[09:45:40] <shoky> a form which is an input?
[09:45:54] <motaka2> aMoniker: Whats the difrence?
[09:46:18] <aMoniker> shoky: heh, good point... I'm reading too close
[09:46:35] <Saaether> motaka2 does action have a value?
[09:46:37] <aMoniker> motaka2: the space before :input - but shoky has better advice
[09:46:53] <motaka2> Saaether: Yes it does
[09:47:19] <shoky> motaka2: why not  var inputs = $(this).find(':input')
[09:47:57] <motaka2> aMoniker: in another code it works with that space but doesnt work in this code so I think the space plays no role. I I deleted that extara space and sstill it is empty
[09:48:18] <shoky> motaka2: the space plays a huge role, but in your case it is needed
[09:48:30] <aMoniker> motaka2: fair enough
[09:48:34] <shoky> motaka2: but its not needed if you just use $(this).find
[09:50:07] <motaka2> shoky: It works absolutely fine, thank what was wrong with the previous ?
[09:50:34] <shoky> motaka2: probably the action has some characters that need escaping when you put it in a selector, or something like that
[09:51:23] <motaka2> shoky: ok your solution is the best it was two days I was working on this. Do you have any seggestion for a good jquery or javascript book ?
[09:51:44] <shoky> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[09:51:52] <shoky> ?learn
[09:51:53] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:53:58] <motaka2> shoky: thanks , what about Node.js m do u have a suggestion ?
[09:56:22] <shoky> motaka2: nopes sry
[09:57:37] <motaka2> thanks anyway

[10:02:22] <darkfrog> is there a more efficient way to modify the offset of an absolute positioned element than: $(...).offset({left: '200px'}); ?  It seems to work rather sluggishly.
[10:02:55] <ss23> darkfrog: .css?
[10:03:08] <darkfrog> whereas $(...).width(200) is very fast
[10:04:13] <aMoniker> darkfrog: like ss23 said - $(...).css('left', '200px');
[10:05:33] <darkfrog> ah, yes, that is MUCH faster
[10:05:39] <stephen_camilo> Hi
[10:05:42] <dumbdell> darkfrog use transistions
[10:05:42] <darkfrog> surprising that it makes such a difference
[10:05:57] <darkfrog> dumbdell: how so?
[10:06:17] <stephen_camilo> How do I reload the page as I resize the window?
[10:06:28] <dumbdell> is it for the purposes of creating movement darkfrog ?
[10:06:37] <aMoniker> darkfrog: It is surprising... I didn't even know you could set with offset(), I only ever used it for getting
[10:06:40] <aMoniker> darkfrog: submit a bug report :)
[10:06:40] <dumbdell> or do you just want to change rawly
[10:07:15] <stephen_camilo> How do I reload a page as I resize the window?
[10:07:49] <darkfrog> dumbdell: no, it's for a resizing widget
[10:08:47] <dumbdell> ok dont worry.. if it was going to be moving then you would use a transition the browser will run better and it will look smoother
[10:09:03] <RefactorNinja> stephen_camilo: there is a $(window).resize(function(){ /* do things */ }); but I'm skeptical that you really want to re-load the page each time the user changes the window size.
[10:11:00] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: are you asking about responsive design?
[10:14:05] <stephen_camilo> RefactorNinja: yes, that's what I want to do
[10:14:57] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: yes, but I need to be precise with my div em img sizes
[10:16:02] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: I'd have to see an example, but it sounds like something you'd likely want to accomplish with media queries
[10:16:10] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: or using css calc() as well
[10:17:00] <dumbdell> yeah you dont want or need that
[10:17:12] <dumbdell> just good css and markup == page that resizes all by it self
[10:17:44] <dumbdell> ^ stephen_camilo
[10:18:37] <dumbdell> to get a good idea of what your trying to achieve check out twitters bootstrap and Zurbs foundation
[10:19:30] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: I'm using $(window).resize(function () {...});
[10:19:52] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: best of luck to you
[10:21:20] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker:Am I using the wrong function?
[10:21:47] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: No, that's the function to use if you want to make javascript changes in response to the browser being resized.
[10:22:08] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: but the point above was that JS should be a last resort for that - CSS handles it much more cleanly
[10:24:27] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: In part yes
[10:26:17] <stephen_camilo> with CSS it's used browser width ranges in order to tell the browser which rule to use
[10:26:40] <aMoniker> right
[10:27:00] <aMoniker> what's the specific problem you're solving?
[10:27:58] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: however it gives me size gaps
[10:29:02] <stephen_camilo> I need div to get the exacly size of the window
[10:29:16] <stephen_camilo> and stick to it when resized
[10:30:25] <aMoniker> have a link?
[10:30:58] <stephen_camilo> not yet
[10:31:38] <stephen_camilo> I am using galleria in order to make a slideshow
[10:31:43] <aMoniker> can it be reduced to a jsfiddle?
[10:32:19] <stephen_camilo> I'll try to do so
[10:34:04] <darkfrog> hey guys, trying to write a resizer script (yes, I know jQuery UI has one) but when I resize my image it often creates a selection area: http://jsfiddle.net/BkXMu/
[10:35:10] <darkfrog> in the example just click on the puppies and then use the resize blocks and you should be able to see it (testing on Chrome)
[10:35:39] <darkfrog> I've tried firing stopImmediatePropagation() but that doesn't seem to help
[10:36:00] <aMoniker> darkfrog: you can set $('body').on('select', function() { return false; }); iirc
[10:36:11] <aMoniker> not sure if that's the exact code.. let me look it up
[10:36:44] <darkfrog> aMoniker: and then fire that during resize?
[10:37:45] <aMoniker> darkfrog: ah, I misremembered: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2700000/how-to-disable-text-selection-using-jquery
[10:38:09] <aMoniker> darkfrog: so you'd set that for the whole body (or area or whatever) on mousedown
[10:38:13] <aMoniker> darkfrog: then undo it on mouseup
[10:38:33] <aMoniker> darkfrog: keep in mind that mouseup may happen anywhere in the document, and not just the selection area you're bindign
[10:41:23] <darkfrog> aMoniker: how do I "undo it" though?
[10:43:02] <aMoniker> In that example... removeAttr('unselectable').css('user-select', '').off('selectstart');
[10:43:33] <aMoniker> I'd suggest binding/unbinding body so nothing on the page can be selected while dragging
[10:44:38] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: http://jsfiddle.net/stvcomp/5xYYR/
[10:45:37] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: ok, what's the objective?
[10:47:16] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: as you can see in my code I repeat the same thing I did in the window load inside the resize function
[10:48:45] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: I guess I should make a resizeImg function and call it on window resize
[10:48:49] <stephen_camilo> isnt it?
[10:49:29] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: yeah, that wouldn't be a bad idea
[10:49:56] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: though I'm not sure what's supposed to be happening... on resize it just stretches the image along either dimension
[10:50:14] <aMoniker> the aspect ratio isn't preserved, if that's the objective
[10:50:29] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker: yes
[10:51:14] <stephen_camilo> I tryed to preserve the Aspect Ratio, but no success
[10:52:55] <nsanden> hi guys, on this page http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ what do you call the 2 variations of using this method? looking for the technical term
[10:54:33] <dopie> http://jsbin.com/oremuh/2/edit
[10:54:43] <dopie> why isnt the toggle command working?
[10:56:12] <aMoniker> nsanden: the second method encapsulates the url param in the settings object...
[10:56:46] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: I think you transposed x and y when setting newx and newy.. trying to rerun this jsfiddle but my connection is slow
[10:56:51] <t_kjaergaard> dopie: It does work?
[10:57:15] <nsanden> aMoniker: yes i know how they work, i just cant think of the term for having 2 different ways to use a method
[10:57:37] <t_kjaergaard> dopie: http://jsbin.com/oremuh/4/
[10:57:59] <aMoniker> nsanden: function overloading?
[10:59:03] <stephen_camilo> aMoniker:  think JFiddle is out
[10:59:09] <aMoniker> stephen_camilo: boo :(
[10:59:30] <aMoniker> nsanden: though, I guess that isn't technically what JS is doing, since it's one function handling various combinations of arguments...
[10:59:35] <aMoniker> but it's the same concept
[11:00:33] <nsanden> right i understand
[11:00:40] <aMoniker> nsanden: well, that's what Resig calls it: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-method-overloading/
[11:00:48] <aMoniker> so I'd go with that :)
[11:01:00] <mink> Hi. Anyone know why with no ajax loaded content   $(".likeable-content .like-action").on("click"); work, but   $(".likeable-content").on("click", ".like-action");  not?
[11:03:50] <stephen_camilo> mink: it depends on the DOM structure you made
[11:04:22] <mink> stephen_camilo, .like-action is children of likeable-content
[11:11:21] <aMoniker> mink: in that case, it could be that .like-action isn't present in the DOM yet when the first selector has fired
[11:12:13] <stephen_camilo> mink: seems that when there are only two parameters, the first one is the selector and the second one a function
[11:12:17] <aMoniker> mink: In the second case, you're *delegating* to any present or future children of .likeable-content called .like-action
[11:13:16] <user_corrupt> I am able to style fancybox iframe links with the following block of code: http://pastebin.com/seS0tmXD applied to a fancybox iframe link such as: <a id="fancy" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="includes/schedule.php">link</a>... The problem that I am having is that the same is not working for a fancybox iframe link that I am opening programatically, within the following script: http://pastebin.com/YX1Kijfg
[11:13:18] <user_corrupt> The iframe is being opened with fancybox, but styling is just not being applied in this case.  Thanks in advance for any help.
[11:13:50] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: can you set up a live example?
[11:14:53] <slide> I'm applying an outline to a selected element on my page, however using a single color doesn't work for all elements. If my the outline color is white, things on white backgrounds won't show up very well. Does anyone know of any process of figuring out the best color to use? I imagine it should be the opposite color on the spectrum, but figuring out what the actual background color to negate could be diffi
[11:14:53] <slide> cult
[11:15:11] <slide> as, say the link could be padded and have a white background but be on a dark blue nav area
[11:15:18] <slide> so what color would work there then? =\
[11:15:27] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: sure, if you go to this page, wait a coupl secs for odometer to hit 5000, select "yes", select one of the buttons, then the "thank you" window that pops up is the iframe that I'm trying to style: http://www.petarivcec.com/gm/oilchange/rebuilt/
[11:15:38] <aMoniker> slide: you could combine an outline with a box shadow - white on black
[11:15:52] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: oh, this is exciting
[11:16:09] <slide> hrm possibly
[11:16:24] <user_corrupt> heh, a treasure hunt
[11:17:02] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: ok, so what are the styles you're trying to use?
[11:17:38] <mink> stephen_camilo, aMoniker, thanks for help (:
[11:17:45] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: the block of code here: http://pastebin.com/seS0tmXD
[11:19:39] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: oh, that I'm not sure... you'd have to dig into how fancybox handles those options
[11:19:46] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: sorry, thought it was a css issue
[11:22:41] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: it's all good, maybe I shall post on fancybox mailing list or something
[11:23:47] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: could give it a try, or read the source
[11:24:23] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: being a javacript/jquery noob its very much over my head
[11:25:39] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: fair enough, and there's always time constraints
[11:25:43] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: but there's no better way to learn
[11:26:30] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: here is fancybox if you feel like you could possibly handle it: http://pastebin.com/yynuLpYC
[11:27:03] <aMoniker> user_corrupt: sorry... I can't spend time digging through myself right now
[11:27:19] <user_corrupt> aMoniker: fair enough, it's a huge pile of code
[11:46:08] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I have animate() on $('html, body') - any way to prevent the double complete function?
[11:47:52] <MarcGuay> I just put a var in and checked it before doing running the function, looks alright.
[11:48:19] <lamaster> MarcGuay: Why do you run animation on both of them?
[11:48:31] <MarcGuay> lamaster: Cross browser compat?
[11:48:58] <MarcGuay> Full page animation.  Seems like body works for Chrome and html for Firefox.
[11:57:14] <MarcGuay> $(window).scroll() gets fired after a scrollTop animation is completed if there is still some space to be scrolled.  Any idea why this is or what can be done to stop it?   if the page is animated/scrolled to a position in the middle of the page
[11:57:31] <MarcGuay> Ignore the second part, meant to paste this: http://jsfiddle.net/375kC/
[11:57:47] <MarcGuay> If you change the height of #bottom to 2000px you'll see what I mean in the console.
[12:00:24] <dopie> when i use the toggle command it for some reason jumps at the end
[12:00:27] <dopie> or in the beginning
[12:00:36] <dopie> is there a way for this to be fixed?
[12:01:19] <MarcGuay> dopie: It's not clear what you're asking.  Some demo code might help?
[12:01:26] <dopie> ahh ok
[12:02:08] <squeakytoy> anyone know of a requirejs-ish framwork that only loads JS files and adds it to the document? (without the whole define()-thingy)?

[12:09:30] <Memolition> dopie:  it works fine for me adding jQuery Library
[12:12:15] <dopie> how do i add the lib?
[12:12:17] <dopie> on jsbin?
[12:12:32] <MarcGuay> top left "add library"
[12:13:04] <Ortund> can anyone help me with my "scroll to top" button? http://jsfiddle.net/uyBVG/
[12:14:25] <dopie> ok here is my other question
[12:14:33] <dopie> hmmm
[12:14:39] <Ortund> it's not scrolling, but no errors either
[12:14:50] <MarcGuay> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/uyBVG/2/
[12:15:13] <MarcGuay> What did you expect it to scroll to/from?
[12:15:56] <dopie> ahhh ok now i got it
[12:15:59] <dopie> this is the error
[12:16:00] <dopie> http://jsbin.com/oremuh/1/edit
[12:16:03] <dopie> see
[12:16:05] <dopie> it jumps
[12:16:07] <dopie> when i click on it
[12:17:18] <MarcGuay> dopie: Margin/padding http://jsbin.com/oremuh/9/edit
[12:17:55] <suuuuuper> I'm using a script to vertically center an image inside a div, where I know the div height but not the image height. The problem is the height from the first image is divided and applied to every image instead of using the specific images height and dividing by 2. Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/7X6jn/1/
[12:18:52] <Ortund> MarcGuay it's just supposed to take you back to the top of the page... but animated, so you can see it scrolling
[12:19:31] <MarcGuay> Ortund: But all you had on the page was the arrow so there was nowhere for it to go (and I believe the pixel (0) is required as well)
[12:20:05] <Ortund> MarcGuay looking for this? http://loganyoung.za.net/articles/forms-authentication-in-asp-net/
[12:20:06] <dopie> SWEET!!!!

[12:20:13] <Trisox> hello all quick question what im i doing wrong here ?   '<span ng-class="{\'checked\': value, \'unchecked\': !value}"> {{title}} </span>' +
[12:20:15] <Ortund> my page where the scroll will live
[12:20:26] <Trisox> its about the {{title}} between teh spans
[12:20:57] <MarcGuay> Ortund: Just saying that the jsfiddle you shared wouldn't have worked even if it worked.
[12:21:59] <Ortund> lol yup, I was too lazy to put in the extra height stuff...
[12:22:18] <Ortund> if you refresh the link I pasted, you'll see what I wanted to do exactly
[12:22:55] <Trisox> any one ?
[12:24:01] <MarcGuay> Trisox: That's not enough information to help you.
[12:26:24] <Trisox> oke ill make a fiddle
[12:26:33] <suuuuuper> Anyone have any idea? Problem commented in HTML section: http://jsfiddle.net/7X6jn/2/
[12:28:07] <MarcGuay> suuuuuper: I think you want a $(this) inside the each loop.
[12:30:04] <Trisox> MarcGuay: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/D4F8w/2/
[12:30:38] <suuuuuper> MarcGuay, worked like a charm, thank you!
[12:30:54] <MarcGuay> suuuuuper: That's the beauty of .each
[12:30:56] <Trisox> its the span part .. i want to use {{title}} in a js template
[12:32:00] <MarcGuay> Trisox: I've never used Angular but maybe "title" is a reserved word.  Try another token like "derp"
[12:32:14] <Trisox> oh lol
[12:32:15] <Trisox> k
[12:34:17] <MarcGuay> Doesn't seem to help, not sure what your problem is.
[12:36:11] <Trisox> np
[12:43:17] <BLeg> anyone know if there's a way to tell in jQuery when a page is being printed (i.e the @media print {} style is being used)
[12:45:37] <MarcGuay> BLeg: Does javascript run when you print?
[12:45:58] <BLeg> MarcGuay: No idea.
[12:46:35] <BLeg> MarcGuay: I assumed so, but I've been trying to figure this out for a long time so I don't know what I know anymore lol
[12:47:11] <MarcGuay> BLeg: I would use CSS or look at some of the suggestions here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7726252/can-you-have-call-javascript-only-when-print-is-called
[12:48:16] <BLeg> MarcGuay: Yeah I'm not sure CSS is the solution here... I need to take an array of strings and format one div (a pamphlet essentially) for all of them, but only show a preview when the actual page is viewed... I'll check the S.O solution
[13:26:55] <Pavlov> anyone using iscroll 5 with jquery mobile?
[13:32:10] <dapingwing> hi guys
[13:40:58] <flying_rhino> hello guys
[13:41:40] <jedimind> OH HAI
[13:42:50] <flying_rhino> I have a dumb question about jQuery UI (I have a good amount of javascript knowledge, some jQuery knowledge and a very basic css knowledge. I am much better server-side)
[13:44:59] <sonotos> flying_rhino: and the question is?
[13:45:59] <flying_rhino> I am a bit concerned about how comperhensive the UI really is and how flexible. For starters, can autocomplete be fed from server, via some AJAX scheme?
[13:46:33] <troydm> should jQuery($('myid')).click(function) work in jQuery 1.8 ?
[13:46:43] <troydm> because apparently mine doesn't works
[13:47:36] <flying_rhino> well can it?
[13:48:26] <troydm> flying_rhino: well it worked just fine in 1.7
[13:49:22] <troydm> no wait
[13:49:28] <troydm> is it a part of jQuery UI?
[13:49:42] <flying_rhino> troydm: I am asking separate question regarding jquery UI
[13:49:51] <flying_rhino> troydm: I am something of a noob too :(
[13:51:55] <flying_rhino> I would like to see more examples of jquery UI in action
[13:53:31] <bambanx> hi
[13:54:38] <MarcGuay> flying_rhino: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[13:54:47] <MarcGuay> "When a string is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data."
[13:55:05] <flying_rhino> thank you
[13:55:39] <MarcGuay> troydm: Put up some example code, what you put there is a very bad example.
[13:55:55] <flying_rhino> which WYSIWYG editor is the best with jquery UI. Is tinymice okay?
[13:56:04] <MarcGuay> $('#myid').click(function(){}); makes sense.
[13:56:11] <jedimind> tinymce is not tiny at all any more
[13:56:29] <flying_rhino> what do you recommend to use?
[13:59:13] <jedimind> flying_rhino http://imperavi.com/redactor/
[13:59:58] <flying_rhino> thank you. jedimind. Is it free for commercial use? What are limits.
[14:00:05] <jedimind> read the site :)
[14:02:15] <MarcGuay> slick
[14:02:17] <flying_rhino> jedimind: it is pretty far from opensource
[14:02:34] <flying_rhino> tinymice is free if you don't modify anything
[14:02:43] <flying_rhino> If I am not mistaken
[14:03:06] <jedimind> you didnt specify free / open source :)
[14:03:15] <jedimind> its a lot better than tinymce, but you pay for the premium
[14:03:21] <jedimind> there are also some other lightweight alternatives as well http://xing.github.io/wysihtml5/
[14:03:25] <jedimind> like that for example
[14:03:27] <jedimind> and tons of others
[14:03:59] <jedimind> http://jhollingworth.github.io/bootstrap-wysihtml5/ another one
[14:05:04] <jedimind> oh lets not forget markitup
[14:05:12] <jedimind> http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/
[14:06:39] <platzhirsch> What if my .fail() methods returns just "error" as textStatus and error itself and jqhxr just nothing, empty string somewhat
[14:06:44] <platzhirsch> what am I supposed to make out of this?
[14:09:25] <flying_rhino> jedimind: Thanks. Another reason I am uneasy with jquery UI is that it doesn't seem to cover all of form elements. One thing I would love is file upload that doesn't look like default crap. Also does menu have scroll bar so I can use it like select? Multiple selection would be nice too.
[14:09:43] <flying_rhino> If you could clear some of my confusion I would most appreciate it.
[14:13:11] <fonko> hey guys im trying to iterate this json http://pastebin.com/Nd8h4vCb
[14:13:50] <fonko> but when i write console.log(msg['artist']); it says Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'artist' of undefined
[14:13:56] <fonko> does that make any sense???
[14:15:10] <NoiseEee> fonko: what is "msg"?
[14:15:32] <fonko> its the json i pasted there
[14:15:35] <fonko> sorry
[14:15:38] <fonko> from ajax call
[14:15:40] <flying_rhino> jedimind: what I would love to see is jquery example that simulates ALL the basic html form elements.
[14:15:41] <fonko> i get that in msg
[14:16:11] <jedimind> flying_rhino the thing is, you should really be using the form elements as is
[14:16:14] <jedimind> for a variety of reasons
[14:16:18] <jedimind> rather than trying to manipulate them overly so
[14:17:33] <andrew9184> anyone have a good parallax library to recommend ?
[14:17:44] <flying_rhino> jedimind: okay. But can file upload be reskinned? (I used to be an expert in this sort of stuff but I have been out of the game for years)
[14:17:52] <jedimind> no it cannot
[14:18:02] <jedimind> there's a reason for that though, its a security concern
[14:18:16] <jedimind> you can replace it with something else like a flash assisted input
[14:18:34] <jedimind> but if you were given the opportunity to style it and manipulate it however you want, you could potentially trick people into uploading files
[14:18:46] <jedimind> which is why its notoriously impossible to manipulate and why it shouldnt
[14:19:26] <flying_rhino> jedimind: I see. Well making it in flash is not a problem in principle.
[14:19:54] <flying_rhino> except that the general consensus is that flash is obsolete :(
[14:20:07] <jedimind> it is
[14:20:21] <jedimind> there are some ways to circumvent it like
[14:20:21] <jedimind> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[14:24:54] <flying_rhino> jedimind: my general goal it to have wysiwyg editor with file upload (especially image upload). Server side, it is easy for me, there should be a database table of documents and a table of files associated with those documents, folder to store those documents and a php script to glue it all together. Client side it is a horrorshow.
[14:25:20] <flying_rhino> since you should be able to upload images and immediately incorporate them in your document.
[14:25:32] <jedimind> most of those editors i pointed out to you have image upload built in
[14:25:39] <jedimind> anyway i have to jet, i'll be back later
[14:25:47] <flying_rhino> jedimind: thank you
[14:26:46] <flying_rhino> see ya
[14:30:09] <funhouse> Hi there, just wondering if anyone has ever run into the issue of having an animation stop when switching tabs, when using setTimeout() ?
[14:31:35] <quietschie> hi, can someone help me think of a solution? I had a already working solution but now the html has changed. Most of my jQuery calls would work, if i wouldn't use them on the whole HTML but only on a part. Is there a way to do this globally and not changing every single statement?
[14:32:04] <squeakytoy> if i load a script with $ajax and dataType: "script", and the javascript has an error - the error doesn't get written to the console -.-
[14:38:43] <funhouse> You would think with 800+ users in here there would be more activity
[14:39:05] <funhouse> Must be lots of rich devs in here, spending all their money on coke and whores
[14:40:14] <quietschie> :)
[14:40:50] <quietschie> funhouse: can you suggest a solution for me?
[14:56:12] <Pavlov> anyone know where in jquery mobile it does the 1 pixel scroll to hide the nav stuff on ios?
[14:56:24] <Pavlov> so i can remove it from my site?

[15:37:29] <deyterk> I got it.
[15:38:20] <deyterk> or not.
[15:44:25] <kenyabob> I am trying to write a plugin that will handle multiple sliders on my site. The trouble is, inside a plugin, I want to keep track of some widths, item counts, and selectors unique to each and every slider. I am using this plugin scaffolding https://gist.github.com/5659428
[15:44:50] <kenyabob> Im just no sure the best way to ensure that these plugin properties are unique to each instance and easily saved and accessed
[15:50:38] <shoky> ?data @ kenyabob
[15:50:38] <bot-t> kenyabob, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:52:13] <kenyabob> say I wanted to keep track of which slide number each slider was on, the best way is to use data and read and write from it each time>
[15:52:53] <shoky> probably
[15:53:11] <shoky> see the 'Data' part here  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:54:17] <BlueShark> Hi, I'm trying to detect if a file exists or not using jQuery and I'm using this code to do that, http://jsfiddle.net/spG5G/ . I'm using a php proxy since I can't check remote URLs because of SOP.
[15:54:40] <BlueShark> But, when I click on the button, nothing happens. (the php page: http://pastie.org/7971222)
[15:54:44] <BlueShark> How can I fix this?
[15:56:56] <shoky> BlueShark: check your console for errors, and your devtools network tab to see the actual response from the php
[15:58:28] <shoky> and console.log(msg) in the callback, and also add an error callback
[16:07:32] <arthurstomp> hey folks. Any suggestion to how prevent users from flooding my app with post requests?
[16:08:52] <BlueShark> shoky: Nothing is getting printed in the console. Should I wrap it with document ready like in http://jsfiddle.net/spG5G/1/ ?
[16:35:14] <shoky> BlueShark: probably. what about the other things i said
[16:35:45] <BlueShark> shoky: Tried that but didn't get any errors :/
[16:36:02] <shoky> BlueShark: and your devtools network tab?
[16:36:24] <shoky> what's the status of the request? what's the response?
[16:37:01] <BlueShark> shoky: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by DevTools network tab?
[16:37:35] <shoky> BlueShark: press F12 to get to your browser's devtools, and look for the network tab which shows the http requests
[16:55:11] <not_mike> how do I get this the gray bar to slide up on hover instead of on click? http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/2/
[17:04:53] <Roundaround> not_mike: if you're still here, try looking at .hover()
[17:04:56] <Roundaround> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[17:06:06] <tw2113> i wonder why .on('hover') isn't working for me
[17:07:25] <Roundaround> tw2113: same thing, try .hover() instead
[17:08:33] <tw2113> isn't hover an alias to on though
[17:08:40] <tw2113> i'm taking the shortcut route
[17:10:42] <Roundaround> tw2113: hover was the original.  on was implemented later, methinks
[17:11:00] <Roundaround> not sure what they actually do in the background, but hover works for me :P
[17:11:13] <not_mike> thankyou roundaround
[17:11:17] <not_mike> i hate js so much...
[17:11:20] <Roundaround> np
[17:11:21] <Roundaround> haha
[17:11:22] <tw2113> doesn't mean hover wasn't aliased to on after the fact
[17:11:41] <not_mike> how did you all learn to enjoy js?
[17:11:58] <tw2113> i think that comes as you better understand it
[17:12:34] <Roundaround> ^
[17:12:40] <not_mike> but I dont want to
[17:12:49] <not_mike> the syntax is just so...primitive
[17:13:03] <rmurphey> compared to what?
[17:13:15] <tw2113> good day mr. rmurphey
[17:13:29] <Roundaround> last year I spent 2 months rewriting an entire project management web app suite to be cross-browser compatible
[17:13:39] <Roundaround> so I got to learn it very well
[17:13:49] <Roundaround> also, in what way is the syntax primitive?
[17:13:57] <rmurphey> hello tw2113
[17:14:09] <Roundaround> is less verbose that some strongly types languages, like java and c#, but that's a good thing
[17:14:44] <tw2113> i still need to finish secrets of the javascript ninja
[17:14:52] <Roundaround> tw2113: lol I have that book too
[17:14:55] <Roundaround> been reading it
[17:15:00] <Roundaround> really good read
[17:17:42] <not_mike> rmurphy: compared to python
[17:17:47] <not_mike> or even php
[17:18:01] <coldhead> what the hell is going on in here anyway
[17:18:01] <not_mike> random {( () }; everywhere
[17:18:06] <coldhead> WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
[17:18:07] <not_mike> so confusing
[17:18:35] <not_mike> (@roundaround too)
[17:19:15] <tw2113> we're on drugs, coldhead
[17:20:06] <Inazad> Hi there, why my fancybox is getting under my website ?  http://lemuseedeslilas.com/lilas-photos.php
[17:21:00] <Roundaround> not_mike: comparing languages to python is like comparing a car to a motorcycle.  provides the same purpose, but uses less and it a little more dangerous
[17:21:02] <shoky> tw2113: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#hover-pseudo-event
[17:21:28] <Roundaround> ah, good find shoky
[17:21:28] <ss23> Inazad: Because y ou gave #wrap_centre a z-index of mega high
[17:21:37] <ss23> Inazad: Just remove that zindex (or make it lower than your fancybox stuff
[17:21:38] <ss23> )
[17:21:44] <not_mike> python? more dangerous? all of my wort
[17:21:49] <ss23> Inazad: It's a CSS issue though, not jQuery, btw
[17:22:32] <Inazad> ss23, I've tried 1 and itsnt working
[17:22:42] <ss23> Inazad: Remove the z-index completely.
[17:24:48] <Inazad> ss23, doesn't work
[17:25:09] <not_mike> where would i add the hover function?
[17:25:15] <not_mike> http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/2/
[17:25:31] <not_mike> would I have to make a completely different script altogether?
[17:25:41] <ss23> Inazad: I just tested, it does. But like I said, it's CSS. Ask #css (and being able to show an example would be helpful too, the current site still has a z-index)
[17:25:43] <not_mike> i have no idea what I'm doing
[17:26:41] <Inazad> its worked
[17:26:47] <Inazad> I changed the z-index to 15000
[17:26:50] <Inazad> thanks you
[17:27:08] <tw2113> line 1 not_mike
[17:27:13] <tw2113> instead of toggle
[17:27:28] <not_mike> thank you kind sir
[17:27:37] <not_mike> may allah bless you with millions of virigns
[17:28:00] <not_mike> holy shit it works
[17:28:05] <not_mike> thanks again bud!
[17:28:26] <not_mike> I want to learn jquery but its such a headache to even start
[17:28:27] <tw2113> Roundaround gets the credit
[17:28:34] <not_mike> both of you do
[17:29:01] <not_mike> A simple fool knows that you all a broken rocket needs is a new screw
[17:29:09] <not_mike> an rocket engineer knows where to put it
[17:29:11] <not_mike> a*
[17:29:22] <vladikoff> wat
[17:29:31] <not_mike> that was a terrible analogy
[17:29:37] <Roundaround> lol
[17:29:51] <not_mike> some old asian man told me an analogy like that but I can't exactly remember
[17:29:56] <not_mike> it blew my mind
[17:32:59] <dumbdell> o i thought he was going to goto fiery hell for being a infidel
[18:04:49] <nutron> I'm using a switch statement based on the text in a button drawn by jquery ui.  The button shows "Companies" and the switch tests the text.  But when I console.log the variable, there's a suffix space and newline therefore it doesn't match.  How can I search for this as a substring?  Or is there something I can do to match the contents exactly?
[18:05:32] <rmurphey> nutron: you could try $.trim
[18:05:35] <rmurphey> ?trim
[18:05:35] <bot-t> jQuery.trim(str): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[18:07:02] <nutron> wow jquery has everything huh?
[18:07:07] <nutron> Thanks I'll try that.
[18:08:18] <rmurphey> nutron: modern browsers have String.trim
[18:08:33] <rmurphey> but jquery gives it to you in browsers that don't have it
[18:09:49] <nutron> Hmm, am I using it wrong here?  var txt = $(e.target).text(); $.trim(txt); console.log(txt);
[18:10:02] <nutron> Still shows spaces and newlines on the console.
[18:12:47] <nutron> Oh... hmm I declare the button with a label.  That should still match with .text() right?
[18:13:04] <nutron> Maybe I'm seeing two outputs...  hmm
[18:19:11] <shoky> nutron: $.trim doesn't touch the string, it just returns a new trimmed string.. var trimmed = $.trim(txt);
[18:19:30] <nutron> heh just found that out =)
[18:22:37] <nutron> meh I'm obviously not understanding something here....
[18:28:10] <nutron> http://jsfiddle.net/Kan8b/ first time using jsfiddle, don't understand why the ui elements aren't showing?
[18:29:40] <shoky> nutron: it's because jsfiddle doesnt include jqui css for old versions. http://jsfiddle.net/Kan8b/1/
[18:30:05] <shoky> (or you can add the css as external resource in your fiddle)
[18:30:10] <nutron> ahh I see.
[18:30:58] <nutron> Ok using the chrome inspector on that... I still see spaces and a newline... normal?
[18:31:12] <nutron> Or am I missing something gigantic here?
[18:32:53] <shoky> nutron: you're not seeing the spaces and newline, it's just that you put the click handler on the <span> so it's getting fired twice because of some event bubbling or someshit
[18:33:26] <nutron> oh crap, i did too...
[18:34:45] <shoky> nutron: http://jsfiddle.net/Kan8b/2/
[18:35:28] <shoky> or http://jsfiddle.net/Kan8b/3/
[18:36:01] <nutron> ahh cool :radio, was just reading that =)
[18:36:18] <nutron> Sorry for being a noob, and thanks for the help, appreciate it!
[18:59:39] <rosieres> Hi can somebody tellme why my mousedown is called twice ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/UfS9C/
[19:01:56] <not_mike> in jsfiddle,
[19:02:11] <not_mike> to transfer code from jsfiddle to my website in some file,
[19:02:24] <not_mike> do I have to wrap the js code in a document ready function?
[19:02:40] <Artificial> With jQuery mobile, I'm experiencing some odd behaviour with the menu. http://alexb.dev.bezz.com.au/interface/ - if you click an article, and then the latest menu item at the top, the menu gets displayed twice. Doesn't anyone know what functionality is causing this? It's obviously by design and should have a simple fix.
[19:02:42] <not_mike> ex. http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/2/
[19:04:43] <rosieres> Artificial: Didn´t dig into the code, but the Menu isnt shown twice here
[19:09:05] <Artificial> rosieres, it's inconsistent. Sometimes it does, other times it doesnt. Multiple people have confirmed.
[19:09:22] <rosieres> Sometime is not good :-)
[19:09:36] <not_mike> to transfer code from jsfiddle to my website in some file,
[19:09:39] <not_mike> do I have to wrap the js code in a document ready function?
[19:09:44] <not_mike> ex. http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/2/
[19:10:16] <rosieres> Artificial: Do you have any idea why my mousedown is run twice ? http://jsfiddle.net/UfS9C/
[19:10:50] <rosieres> not_mike: why don´t you just do it ?
[19:11:29] <not_mike> because both are not working
[19:11:41] <not_mike> I want to know which is right so I can get onto the next problem
[19:11:49] <not_mike> Do you know the answer?
[19:11:58] <rosieres> what both ?
[19:12:17] <not_mike> Both not wrapping in document ready and wrapping in document ready
[19:12:35] <not_mike> Do you know which is the right thing to do?
[19:16:38] <rosieres> I put my stuff into a function without wrapping anything
[19:22:42] <not_mike> does your function get stds
[19:22:50] <unnotused> hey guys

[19:33:22] <albert> Hello. Is anyone available for a question?
[19:37:48] <not_mike> sure
[19:38:12] <not_mike> I do not know any js or jquery, though. However if it is a general programming question, I will be happy to attempt to help
[19:49:16] <lenswipee> hi, where can i get images to easily use in a jsfiddle?
[19:58:18] <not_mike> imgur?
[19:58:31] <not_mike> uplad to there, then just use the link of the image
[19:58:44] <not_mike> upload*, lenswipee
[19:59:21] <lenswipee> not_mike: i don't have images/photos to upload. Just want to use whatever is on the internet
[19:59:34] <tw2113> so do that
[19:59:41] <tw2113> get the proper url to the image
[19:59:43] <tw2113> use it
[20:00:05] <not_mike> or if the link is too long, upload it to imgur and use that link
[20:00:54] <rosieres> lenswipee: <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/121/300" /> just alter the both values in the end
[20:01:18] <lenswipee> rosieres: thanks
[20:01:38] <lenswipee> rosieres: what do the values represent?
[20:01:46] <rosieres> guess
[20:01:52] <lenswipee> dimensions?
[20:01:59] <rosieres> with height ??
[20:02:02] * tw2113 gives lenswipee a cookie
[20:02:08] <lenswipee> :D
[20:02:11] <rosieres> width and height :-)
[20:02:45] <tw2113> what does the third part represent though lenswipee :D
[20:03:03] <lenswipee> what third part?
[20:03:12] <tw2113> the 3rd part *points*
[20:03:15] * not_mike is confused
[20:03:20] <tw2113> look at the url
[20:03:21] <not_mike> oh i see it
[20:03:34] <lenswipee> the "g"
[20:03:36] <lenswipee> ?
[20:03:36] <not_mike> yea rosieres what about the 3rd part
[20:03:37] <not_mike> no
[20:03:41] <not_mike> the 3rd part...
[20:03:53] <tw2113> actually the G was what i was thinking
[20:04:03] <not_mike> nope
[20:04:12] <lenswipee> it says "g" not "G"
[20:04:14] <not_mike> think again
[20:04:30] <lenswipee> and i have no idea :-(
[20:04:35] <lenswipee> g is for goat?
[20:04:59] <tw2113> nah, not goat
[20:05:14] <lenswipee> didn't think so.
[20:05:16] <tw2113> it represents..........a letter
[20:05:27] <lenswipee> g is a letter
[20:05:35] <lenswipee> _is_
[20:05:47] <tw2113> and it can't represent itself?
[20:06:21] <lenswipee> i don't know.
[20:06:25] <tw2113> what up, g?
[20:06:33] <tw2113> yo homie g
[20:06:37] <lenswipee> g is for google?
[20:06:45] <tw2113> i dunno
[20:06:53] <tw2113> my serious answer was "a letter"
[20:07:05] <lenswipee> ok
[20:07:09] <rosieres> grey ?????????????
[20:07:16] <lenswipee> thank you tw2113
[20:07:27] <rosieres> leave it and the pictures are coloured
[20:07:31] <tw2113> i have no authority to say what it ACTUALLY represents for placekitten
[20:07:34] <tw2113> but it sounded good
[20:08:49] <bambanx> anyone know a slider for a lot of images like 300 or more ? thanks
[20:09:19] <rosieres> bambanx write your own :-)
[20:09:29] <bambanx> oh i wish
[20:09:36] <bambanx> but i dont know how
[20:09:47] <bambanx> i am trying to hire a guy on odesk for do this job
[20:09:53] <bambanx> with support video and autoplay
[20:10:06] <rosieres> can somebody assist me in arrays and module for going next and prev ?
[20:10:30] <rosieres> modulo not module :-)
[20:11:11] <tw2113> i think you had it right the first time
[20:11:53] <tw2113> meaning i see no typo
[20:12:26] <rosieres> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
[20:13:04] <tw2113> ah
[20:13:09] <tw2113> i got myself mixed up
[20:13:16] <tw2113> you meant to say modulo
[20:13:23] <tw2113> *goes to his corner to play with his g*
[20:13:36] <rosieres> google ?
[20:13:39] <rosieres> haha
[20:13:46] <rosieres> g*
[20:26:23] <madprops> what's wrong with this? http://scrot.it/343
[20:26:52] <madprops> it appears to enter a loop when I add it
[20:28:21] <madprops> ugh looking at it I guess it's obvious a loop will form since it's calling itself
[20:28:29] <madprops> I just grabbed that example from another site
[20:30:04] <madprops> this is not working neither http://scrot.it/344
[20:42:39] <madprops> ah nvm it was a typo
[20:53:48] <mogaj> Hi i am getting this error while using jquery,json and ajax http://pastebin.com/VxjX2HXL ... can some one tell what am i doing wrong
[20:55:48] <dualcore> how do you get the value of a selected item from an option list?
[20:56:52] <lerous> to dualcore use obj.find("option:selected")
[21:15:17] <mogaj> Complete data which is render in the error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined' http://pastebin.com/NqWfGtDP what am i doing wrong?
[21:50:09] <Cork> mogaj: looks like you're expecting to get an array, but you get an object
[22:16:28] <sinusss> hi. I have got a question about KnockoutJS. How do I make this work? http://pastie.org/7972326 I want to bind Meta.0.meta_default_value to a textbox
[22:17:16] <Cork> you can't use numbers with dot notation
[22:17:35] <Cork> Meta[0].meta_default_value
[22:18:32] <sinusss> Cork let me try that
[22:19:01] <Cork> can't help you much about knockout though
[22:19:13] <sinusss> Cork, I get Error: Unable to parse bindings. Message: TypeError: Meta[0] is undefined; :(
[22:19:41] <sinusss> hmmm thanks anyways, too bad nobody talks in #knockoutjs
[22:19:42] <Cork> where do you get the object from?
[22:20:33] <Cork> it looks like it should be <unknown varialbe>.formItems[0].Meta[0].meta_default_value
[22:21:33] <sinusss> anything inside formItems[0] I can just access it right away. eg: formItems[0].label, I can access it with just "label"
[22:24:47] <sinusss> i have temporarily solved this by treating by looping
[22:25:04] <sinusss> for now I will assume that every Meta is more than 1 item
[23:17:10] <xertion> hi guys, I'm creating an element with createElement('div'); and then I want to add a .click() even on that, so if someone click on that div a function get called.
[23:17:26] <xertion> the click event works fine if I include the div in the HTML, but when it's created with createElement() the .click event does not fire.
[23:17:29] <xertion> Anyone know why?
[23:21:44] <Cork> xertion: how are you binding the click event to the new element?
[23:24:33] <xertion> Cork: The element is created when "handleDrop()" is called (It's drag-drop application). Outside that function, I then have a $('.classofnewelement').click( myclickfunction );
[23:25:53] <Cork> xertion: ok, $('selector') searches through the page and .click then binds a click handler on that list of element
[23:26:07] <Cork> so if the element doesn't exist when the $('selector') runs it won'
[23:26:15] <Cork> *'t get a event listener
[23:26:22] <Cork> *an
[23:26:43] <xertion> So since it's a dynamically created element that can be created after page load, how do I make sure it listen for the click event?
[23:26:55] <Cork> you have two options, 1. bind the event handler explicitly on the new element before you add it
[23:27:01] <Cork> or 2. use delegated event handlers
[23:36:00] <xertion> Cork: Thanks a lot, delegate() works great.
[23:42:29] <houser> How can i get mouse coordinates in a canvas relative to upper left corner of the canvas?
[23:43:29] <Cork> houser: the mousemove event
[23:44:31] <houser> Cork, ok, even though the element is absolutely positioned it should work?
[23:44:44] <Cork> as long as nothing covers it
[23:52:38] <spronk> can anyone help me with a scope question? http://pastebin.com/fqQGQWXg - changeId isn't available for the .live() bound closure... why? and how do i fix it?
[23:54:39] <Cork> spronk: it should be
[23:54:53] <Cork> spronk: side note; live is deprecated, and removed in later versions of jquery
[23:55:02] <spronk> bleh D:
[23:55:12] <Cork> ?.delegate
[23:55:13] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[23:55:22] <Cork> use that instead ^
[23:56:12] <spronk> ahh
[23:56:13] <spronk> cool
[23:58:08] <spronk> wait.. according to that delegate in 1.7 has been superceded by .on
[23:58:16] <spronk> is .on() fully "live" if you will?
[23:58:27] <Cork> no
[23:58:39] <unnu> alright, stupidest question ever, how do i make a function with jquery? it seems like i need to do something with $.fn.something idk?
[23:58:43] <Cork> lives syntax has been removed; cause it has a syntax problem
[23:59:04] <Cork> spronk: .on has a syntax that looks like delegate though
[23:59:14] <Cork> (notice the selector argument)
