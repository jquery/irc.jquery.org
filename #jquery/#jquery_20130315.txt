[02:04:39] <Olive6767> Hi ALl :-)
[02:21:33] <Olive6767> I have controls in a div that i would like to fadeout when the user mouse is not moving except if the user mouse is over any of these controls. TO do so I have coded the following: http://jsfiddle.net/GKFDk/1/
[02:22:15] <Olive6767> the mousemove timeout works perfectly, however the mouseover event dones't do what I'm expecting. ANy idea?
[02:23:40] <Olive6767> sorry: update code: http://jsfiddle.net/GKFDk/2/
[02:27:12] <Olive6767> nobody?
[02:29:44] <Cork> Olive6767: you would have to bind a mouseenter on the controls, set a variable when it triggers
[02:29:56] <Cork> clear it when leave triggers triggers
[02:30:40] <Olive6767> hummm...
[02:31:09] <Olive6767> trying it...
[02:31:45] <Cork> Olive6767: http://jsfiddle.net/GKFDk/3/
[02:32:46] <Olive6767> Faster then me ;-) Thx Cork ! :)
[02:33:31] <Nebros> hi all, i have there a little problem with ajax in django. i have a link like this:  http://blabla/ch   i need now this link in my views in the part of the ajax loaded parts.  end = request.path  will not work, cause the loadet data are not on this mainpage. how i have to load this link?
[02:35:01] <Cork> Nebros: do you mean to know from what url ajax content was loaded from?
[02:37:34] <Nebros> i need the last 2  "ch" from the link. but when i try this by the parts loadet from ajax, are the last 2 not "ch"
[02:38:43] <Nebros> end = request.path   link = end[-2:]   like this i have the last two. but in the ajax parts is this not the correct link
[02:39:00] <Nebros> have i to give the variable with ajax?
[02:39:04] <Cork> Nebros: that syntax isn't javascript
[02:39:21] <Nebros> no, that was a little part from django
[02:39:37] <Cork> so, what does the question have to do with jquery?
[02:39:50] <Nebros> its a question about ajax
[02:40:24] <Cork> uh, if you make a request url in javascript, you would have to use regex to grab the end of the url
[02:40:25] <Nebros> can i give a variable with ajax to the next page?
[02:40:46] <Cork> it depends on your backend
[02:42:35] <Nebros> i did something like this    <div id="test" data-variable="{{ formvar }}"></div>    many time ago and i dont know how this works
[02:42:57] <Nebros> in ajax was this         var variable = $('#test').data('variable');
[02:43:04] <Cork> no not in ajax
[02:43:06] <Cork> it jquery
[02:43:14] <Cork> ajax is a term for sending data
[02:43:19] <Cork> that is javascript
[02:43:48] <Nebros> is ajax not a part of javascript?
[02:44:03] <Cork> eh...
[02:44:05] <Cork> no not really
[02:44:09] <Trisox> cork
[02:44:11] <Cork> ajax is a term for updating a page
[02:44:14] <Trisox> dude
[02:44:15] <Trisox> sup
[02:44:32] <Cork> Trisox: nothing much
[02:44:52] <Trisox> ;) cool
[02:44:56] <Trisox> me either
[02:45:16] <Trisox> doing some bit of changes  on a site nothing to get it warm from..
[02:52:30] <ladislaw> anyone have a url to format and clean a script?
[02:53:15] <Cork> .g butify script
[02:53:16] <b-ot> Cork: Online JavaScript beautifier → http://jsbeautifier.org/
[02:57:09] <DarsVaeda> how do I get "$('fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a').live('click')" to ".on('click', '',...)"?
[02:57:11] <seutje> butt-ify it!
[02:57:39] <Cork> $(document).live('click', 'fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a')
[02:57:55] <seutje> s/live/on
[02:57:56] <Cork> opps
[02:58:00] <Cork> ya
[02:58:12] <seutje> I thought u can't really bind to document?
[02:58:23] <Cork> sure you can
[02:59:01] <seutje> yeah, I must be tripping, can't find the reference anymore anyway
[02:59:05] <DarsVaeda> isn't this bad? because then it will always be there?
[02:59:17] <Cork> DarkAceZ: same is true for live
[02:59:44] <Cork> DarkAceZ: live binds on document too, it just waists some work and then does it in the background
[03:00:01] <DarsVaeda> no I mean instead of something like "$('fieldset').on('click', 'legend > a'...
[03:00:11] <seutje> and does awkward things to determine a selector to go with the context
[03:00:14] <Cork> $('fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a').live('click') is the same as doing $('fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a'); $(document).on('click', 'fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a')
[03:00:33] <seutje> that wouldn't be exactly the same as your live implementation though
[03:00:33] <DarsVaeda> stop :D I can't even use live anymore ^^
[03:00:42] <Cork> seutje: it is
[03:00:51] <Cork> well ok fine
[03:01:16] <Cork> var target = $('fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a'); $(document).on('click', $(document).live('click', 'fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a').selector)
[03:01:21] <Cork> bah
[03:01:31] <seutje> nah, $('fieldset').on('click', '.legend > a, legend > a') would fail if ur adding fieldsets dynamically
[03:01:35] <Cork> var target = $('fieldset legend > a, .fieldset .legend > a'); $(document).on('click', target.selector)
[03:01:36] <DarsVaeda> or can I do $('fieldset, .fieldset).on('click', 'legend >a, .legend >a'...?
[03:01:46] <seutje> doing it on document (like live does) still allows u to do that
[03:02:06] <Cork> DarkAceZ: you can, as long as the fieldset exists when you run your selector
[03:02:36] <DarsVaeda> yes it does :)
[03:02:43] <seutje> so yeah, it depends, are u adding fieldsets dynamically, or just links (or legends)
[03:02:45] <seutje> ?
[03:02:57] <Cork> DarkAceZ: then yes it would work
[03:03:20] <DarsVaeda> legends
[03:03:45] <seutje> if ur only adding links dynamically, might aswell use $('legend fieldset, .legend .fieldset').on('click', '> a', fn)
[03:04:03] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks :)
[03:04:41] <Cork> DarkAceZ: you want to bind the listener to as few parents as possible
[03:04:53] <Cork> so actually, its better to bind on ex. the form
[03:16:14] <seutje> Cork: I thought it was closest static parent, so it doesn't fire *all* the time
[03:16:32] <Cork> seutje: nope live has ALWAYS been on document
[03:16:38] <seutje> yeah I know
[03:16:47] <Cork> ah you meant that
[03:16:51] <seutje> but I thought that was part of the reason the changed it, so u could pick a closer parent
[03:16:58] <Cork> well you want as few event handlers as possible
[03:17:23] <Cork> so it you can pick one grouping parent that is a parent to all the elements, its even better
[03:17:48] <seutje> so then u do end up with everything on document
[03:17:48] <Cork> cause then you don't slow down the dom with more event listeners then needed
[03:18:06] <Cork> seutje: not necessarily
[03:18:29] <seutje> yeah, but I mean, if u need 17 handlers, is it best to put them all on the same top-level parent instead of using a closer one for each handler?
[03:18:39] <Cork> ex. if you have a div, and in that several tabels, and in a link in the td of each table you want to listen for an event
[03:18:58] <Cork> the best place to connect the listener is the wrapping div, cause then you only need one listener
[03:19:22] <Cork> seutje: well tecknically ya
[03:19:28] <seutje> yeah, I get that, but then why not put everything on the document?
[03:19:33] <Cork> but delegate normally can't help you there
[03:19:41] <Cork> cause it binds one listener for each time you call it
[03:19:49] <seutje> uhu
[03:19:56] <Cork> you would have to build the entire logic for handle listeners your self
[03:20:10] <seutje> so which is it? better to put all on document or to put them on closest static parent?
[03:20:17] <Cork> so if you bind 17 delegated event listeners on document
[03:20:23] <Cork> you get 17 event listeners on document
[03:20:32] <seutje> yeah, ofc
[03:20:34] <Cork> seutje: that doesn't really matter
[03:20:44] <Cork> what matters is to try to not have hundreds of event listeners
[03:20:51] <seutje> lol obviously
[03:20:53] <Cork> cause that slows down the dom
[03:21:10] <Cork> so you want to not have a list of elements and bind event listeners on them
[03:21:11] <seutje> I'm just wondering about the impact of the lil check it does to see if target matches the selector
[03:21:20] <Cork> you want ONE parent of all those elements and bind it there
[03:21:43] <Cork> doens't really make much difference
[03:21:55] <Cork> well it depends on the speed of the selector your using, sure
[03:22:08] <seutje> it always boils down to that
[03:22:12] <Cork> but it affects the speed less then having a lot of event listeners
[03:22:22] <Cork> of course
[03:23:02] <seutje> I usually tend to try find the closest static parent, otherwise I do indeed feel tempted to route it through my own single document event handler
[03:23:04] <seutje> :P
[03:23:16] <seutje> and I rly don't wanna head down that path
[03:23:54] <Cork> closest static parent that makes sense to bind on is normally the correct one
[03:23:56] <Cork> but not always
[03:25:20] <seutje> I also have a tendency to put a specific class on elements I bind events to
[03:25:31] <seutje> mainly to help coworkers out when debugging
[03:25:42] <Cork> seutje: ex. $('table td.dynamic').on('click', 'span.remove', function() {}); $('table td.dynamic').each(function() { $(this).append('<span class="remove">&nbsp</span> });
[03:25:57] <Cork> just binding on table is a much better option
[03:26:44] <seutje> yeah, cause ur looking for a single parent
[03:27:01] <Cork> cause it makes little sense binding on the td
[03:27:11] <Cork> as the table is a safe single parent to bind on
[03:27:24] <seutje> and it's more binding that do exactly the same
[03:27:30] <seutje> bindings*
[03:27:31] <Cork> (and the example was meant as the tr and td was static, and the links was added)
[03:27:38] <Cork> exactly
[03:27:47] <Cork> that was the hole point of the argument :)
[03:27:49] <seutje> only makes sense to make a separate handler if it actually does a separate thing
[03:27:59] <Cork> that was the hole point of the argument :) <--
[03:28:33] <seutje> yeah, sorry if it seemed like I disagree
[03:35:15] <deepy> Since .live doesn't support blur, how would I continue?
[03:35:29] <Cork> deepy: live isn't supported at all
[03:35:40] <air_> :)
[03:35:44] <deepy> Does it work with on?
[03:35:52] <Cork> .focusout
[03:36:01] <deepy> oh
[03:36:05] <Cork> hmm wonder how you write this with the new bot...
[03:36:08] <Cork> ..focusout
[03:36:13] <Cork> '.focusout
[03:36:15] <Cork> bah
[03:36:38] <Cork> deepy: make sure you test it in all browsers though, i'
[03:36:49] <Cork> *i'm not sure it actually works cross browsers
[03:37:02] <deepy> I tried .on("focusout" but it doesn't work with my dynamically added input box
[03:37:15] <deepy> it works with the one I added normally though
[03:37:22] <Cork> .on('focusout', 'selector' )
[03:37:23] <Cork> ?
[03:37:58] <deepy> $(".inputfield").on("focusout", function () { window.alert("Foo!"); });
[03:38:06] <deepy> ooh
[03:38:07] <Cork> thats not a delegeted listener

[03:50:48] <reliability> hi
[03:50:52] <Cork> Trisox: it started as a nick from a character in a swedish song
[03:50:55] <xec> hello reliability!!
[03:51:25] <reliability> jQuery().ajax() always ends in fail(), even though the requests url works and the get-request is sent (checked with livehttpheaders)...
[03:51:49] <sacho> and what do you receive?
[03:52:14] <reliability> well, the script returns a json-object.
[03:52:22] <reliability> however, ajax always calls the fail()-callback.
[03:52:50] <Trisox> ah :)
[03:52:51] <sacho> and what are you receiving in that fail callback?
[03:52:54] <Trisox> mine is worse i think
[03:52:59] <reliability> http://pastebin.com/1QVPi8p2
[03:53:10] <Cork> Trisox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3xHMunMNHQ
[03:53:16] <reliability> The textStatus is just "error".
[03:53:27] <Trisox> 3socks...
[03:53:48] <Cork> reliability: is the call cross domain?
[03:53:56] <reliability> yep
[03:54:01] <Cork> theres your problem
[03:54:14] <Cork> you normally can't do cross domain ajax calls
[03:54:37] <reliability> ok
[03:55:54] <reliability> thanks
[03:56:00] <Trisox> This video contains content from UMG. It is not available in your country.
[03:56:00] <Trisox> :D
[03:56:09] <reliability> but can I turn it on, somehow?
[03:56:16] <Cork> reliability: not really
[03:56:26] <Cork> you can do cors in some browsers
[03:56:39] <Cork> but its controlled by the sending server (not the requesting page)
[03:56:41] <reliability> this is prevented by the browser?
[03:56:43] <Cork> .mdn cors
[03:56:43] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[03:56:47] <Cork> reliability: yes
[03:57:14] <reliability> but why is the request even sent?
[03:57:23] <Cork> cause the browser blocks it
[03:57:38] <reliability> but i can see a corresponding response in livehttpdheaders...
[03:57:57] <Cork> ya, cause its priviliged code == no cors restriction
[03:58:00] <sacho> because the server you are querying might allow the particular cross-doimain request
[03:58:12] <sacho> domain, even.
[03:58:17] <Cork> no if they did he would se it in the page
[03:58:27] <sacho> he's asking why a request is made at all
[03:58:40] <Cork> cause how else would the browser see the cors header?
[03:58:42] <joelataylor> why does $(element).closest('td').addClass('focus'); - find the element, but not add the class?
[03:58:49] <sacho> that's what I said..
[03:59:01] <Cork> allow the particular cross-doimain request <-- no
[03:59:21] <Cork> even if the server don't have the cors header, the browser still have to ask it to get the headers
[03:59:32] <Cork> and that is the get request
[03:59:45] <Cork> an exception is for post where the browser does an options request first
[03:59:48] <sacho> why are you misquoting me?
[04:00:07] <reliability> hmm... i have control over the header on my server... so i could fix that
[04:00:11] <Cork> ah, no i'm not i'm miss reading what you typed
[04:00:11] <sacho> but whatever, this is a pointless discussion
[04:00:32] <Cork> reliability: ya, but then comes the second problem, it doesn't work in ie
[04:00:45] <reliability> ie... doesn't matter for now. ;)
[04:00:52] <anew> hey guys anyone using require.js in here
[04:00:54] <anew> https://github.com/jrburke/require-jquery/blob/master/jquery-require-sample/webapp/scripts/main.js
[04:00:54] <reliability> this is for testing purpose only
[04:00:57] <anew> pleaase look here
[04:01:07] <anew> if i had say 15 plugins (exageration) do they all go in this main.js file ?
[04:02:57] <sacho> sure, if you need to use all of them whenever you use main.js.
[04:03:29] <anew> sacho one other question, why is there $(function(){ on line 3 there
[04:03:36] <anew> why not just go straight to $('body')...
[04:04:26] <sacho> do you know what thta does?
[04:04:28] <sacho> that*
[04:05:29] <anew> well i know what $('body') does... but that's my question i dont know what $(function() line 3 is doing
[04:05:55] <xec> anew: it's a shorthand for $(document).ready(function(){ ... })
[04:06:12] <anew> xec weird because require doesnt need document ready ( i thought )
[04:06:21] <sacho> exactly.
[04:06:30] <sacho> so your js modules could have loaded before your document has loaded.
[04:07:18] <reliability> thx a lot!
[04:07:18] <anew> yes but there is a require option to allow you to load when dom loads
[04:07:23] <anew> so this is unecessary this line isnt it
[04:08:28] <xec> anew: http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#pageload
[04:09:00] <sacho> does it?
[04:09:12] <Rembane> Good morning, I want to find all the event listeners on an element and then copy them to another element. How do I do that?
[04:09:30] <anew> xec i guess it's just safter to put $(function) in there to be sure
[04:09:31] <anew> ok
[04:09:33] <anew> is that correct
[04:09:47] <xec> basically, from what i can see
[04:09:47] <Cork> Rembane: that is tricky, and not really supported
[04:10:42] <Cork> Rembane: the best way to handle that is normally to delegate the event listener
[04:11:06] <anew> xec one other question lol... to prevent this main.js file from being 2000 lines long ...
[04:11:19] <Rembane> Cork: Okay. Nifty solution though. I'll look into it. Thanks.
[04:11:23] <anew> i make other function callsl within it to other pages that have 'define'
[04:11:29] <anew> instead of require
[04:11:31] <anew> dependencies

[04:11:48] <Rembane> Nifty indeed.
[04:11:50] <Cork> also the on command have a delegate syntax too see ?.on

[04:12:39] <Cork> o/
[04:13:47] <xec> anew: i'm really not the person to answer you, but i thought the whole point of modular design was that you would never need one large file
[04:14:23] <anew> yeah that is the point, i guess my question is now  how do i split everything up
[04:24:17] <Lann> Heyas
[04:24:28] <Olive6767> does .stop() has effect on .fadeOut()?
[04:24:30] <Lann> How can I refer to the href of the current link within it's click handler?
[04:24:37] <Cork> Olive6767: yes
[04:24:54] <Cork> Lann: this.href
[04:24:59] <Lann> it's blank
[04:25:16] <Lann> but the href isnt blank
[04:25:18] <Cork> then you don't have a href on the tag
[04:25:37] <Cork> what type of element is it?
[04:25:39] <iCommando> mozilla firefox addons channgel?
[04:25:41] <iCommando> channel*
[04:25:43] <Lann> an a tag
[04:25:56] <Cork> ?p @ Lann
[04:25:57] <bot-t> Lann, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:26:09] <Cork> see if you can reproduce it there
[04:26:30] <teitoklein01_> is it possible to put a "waiting" overlay during button submit? I just managed to produce it during non-refreshing ajax $.post
[04:27:02] <Cork> teitoklein01_: sure, just show it before you do the call, and the hide it when the success is called
[04:27:15] <Cork> (success, done, always, or complete)
[04:27:31] <teitoklein01_> is it do-able using $(selector).submit()?
[04:27:43] <iCommando> ???
[04:27:53] <Cork> teitoklein01_: submit has nothing to do with it
[04:28:26] <Cork> iCommando: was that a question?
[04:28:40] <Cork> or just a typo?
[04:28:54] <teitoklein01_> i think my question is pretty vague. what i mean is a waiting overlay during the page load.
[04:29:15] <Lann> cork: https://gist.github.com/minusreality/5169232
[04:29:15] <Cork> during page load or during $.post?
[04:29:33] <Cork> Lann: please use one of the pages indicated
[04:29:41] <Lann> anyone else?
[04:29:42] <Cork> a dead dump normally doens't help
[04:30:03] <Lann> it's a simple question so i was hoping to not set up a full jsfiddle
[04:30:18] <teitoklein01_> during page load . for example you type facebook.com and then the page is loading . so during the loading process the waiting overlay will appear and when the page finished loading the overlay will disappear
[04:30:26] <Cork> Lann: a full jquery? the link in the html section and reproducing the click problem in the js section?
[04:30:35] <Cork> thats hardly a too much to ask
[04:31:06] <Lann> anyone mind taking a look at my gist?
[04:31:41] <Cork> teitoklein01_: thats normally done by haveing the overlay show when the page starts, and then removinging it on ex. load
[04:31:52] <Cork> teitoklein01_: or from a $.post response or what ever you eneed
[04:31:56] <Cork> *need
[04:32:08] <teitoklein01_> how would I detect if the page finished loading?
[04:32:47] <teitoklein01_> can it be detected by just putting the hide script in the bottom of the body?
[04:33:08] <Cork> ?.load @ teitoklein01_
[04:33:09] <bot-t> teitoklein01_, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[04:33:20] <Cork> the dom will tell you
[04:33:44] <teitoklein01_> Okay thanks bot-t Cork
[04:33:46] <Cork> teitoklein01_: or like i said, if you need ajax, do it in the ajax callback
[04:33:48] <teitoklein01_> i will take a look at that
[04:35:20] <Lann> cork: the answer was to use jquery's this and attr
[04:39:32] <jessica_> need help on this line of code
[04:39:33] <jessica_> <div class="editable" id="img2"><img class="sm" src="images/work/ad-council_h2.jpg" alt="Interior Page"></div>
[04:39:39] <jessica_> can any1 guide me please
[04:39:51] <Cork> jessica_: not before you ask the question
[04:40:12] <jessica_> i want class="sm" to be outside the img tag
[04:40:21] <jessica_> but want it to still effect my image
[04:40:36] <jessica_> problem is in my cms when the user changes the images, the tag is removed
[04:40:47] <jessica_> so image placement does not work
[04:40:56] <Cork> uh so .sm img {} ?
[04:41:13] <Cork> or possibly .sm > img {}
[04:41:20] <jessica_> can u rewrite my line , i am not so friendly with coding at the moment
[04:41:24] <jessica_> i'll copy n test it
[04:41:38] <Cork> it kinda depends on what you need
[04:41:52] <jessica_> i told u
[04:41:59] <Olive6767> Cork: related to my question with stop() => http://jsfiddle.net/jaZep/4/  => press spacebar, then wait half a second and repress sapcebar => the fadeout keepgoing on instead of resseting for another 1sec delay then fadeout
[04:42:10] <Cork> not really, just moving the class in the html won't fix your page
[04:42:33] <jessica_> then ?
[04:42:36] <jessica_> whats the sol. for me ?
[04:44:05] <jmaister> Learn to code?
[04:44:39] <jessica_> oh come on please, i am here to resolve a small issue m facing
[04:44:56] <Cork> Olive6767: http://jsfiddle.net/jaZep/6/
[04:45:07] <Cork> Olive6767: it stops the fade just fine, just not the delay
[04:47:04] <Cork> Olive6767: http://jsfiddle.net/jaZep/7/
[04:47:20] <jessica__> <div class="editable" id="img2"><img class="sm" src="images/work/ad-council_h2.jpg" alt="Interior Page"></div>
[04:47:45] <jessica__> please take the class="sm" tag out of img but it still should effect it
[04:47:50] <jessica__> any help
[04:47:56] <Cork> jessica_: 1. i can move the attribute for you, but that won't fix the css, 2. your question has nothing to do with jquery
[04:48:23] <jessica__> Cork, give it to me, it may do my work
[04:48:37] <Cork> fine
[04:48:42] <Cork> <div class="editable" id="img2" class="sm"><img src="images/work/ad-council_h2.jpg" alt="Interior Page"></div>
[04:48:51] <Cork> won't solve anything for you though
[04:49:14] <deepy> And then, lo and behold, the class is gone!
[04:50:02] <anew> hey sorry back... so anyone new in the chatroom using require.js :D
[04:50:38] <jessica__> http://i.imgur.com/FnaL7WA.jpg
[04:50:52] <jessica__> Cork, see the right side image
[04:51:00] <jessica__> this is what i dont want :(\
[04:51:52] <Cork> jessica__: no i don't, and if you don't know enough to move some html tags around you shouldn't have the job to start with
[04:52:29] <jessica__> y i am here
[04:52:39] <jessica__> just for help so that i can learn this
[04:52:47] <jessica__> is it too a big thing ??
[04:53:31] <Cork> jessica__: ah, if your here to learn start at http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[04:53:49] <Cork> learn how html sticks together, then css and then you can start looking at jquery
[04:53:59] <jessica__> thanks  but i am a unity3d coder
[04:54:05] <jessica__> helping my client on request
[04:54:16] <WHTM> Hi, I have this xml file http://pastebin.com/Ud29jZWx and I'm using $(xml).find(.. to grab things from it. What would I put to specify I only want the <title> objects from <action> ?? thanks
[04:54:16] <Cork> then your kinda over your head...
[04:54:33] <jessica__> so if possible help me :)
[04:54:52] <Cork> WHTM: .find('action title')
[04:55:10] <Cork> jessica__: your way to much over your head
[04:55:14] <WHTM> Oh, thats simple
[04:55:17] <WHTM> Thanks Cork
[04:55:18] <Cork> i would basically have to do all the job for you
[04:55:19] <jessica__> ?
[04:55:23] <Cork> WHTM: np
[04:55:31] <jessica__> is it ?
[04:56:27] <Cork> well modifying a page when you don't even know how the basics works won't ever end well
[04:56:47] <jessica__> i know
[04:57:05] <jessica__> what can i say, client rquest sayin, ITS JUUUUUUUUUST AN IMAGEEEE
[04:57:24] <Cork> so really, find someone that knows html+css+js and pay them to help you with it
[04:57:35] <jessica__> but this is not gonna be that big
[04:57:38] <jessica__> i am sure
[04:57:40] <jessica__> isnt it ?
[04:57:54] <Cork> it really depends on what the css looks like
[04:58:09] <jessica__> hmm
[04:58:13] <WHTM> It could be complicated it could be simple, and it would take some time and effort to find out
[04:58:14] <jessica__> lemme open it
[04:58:19] <Cork> and either way your off topic for this channel
[04:58:24] <WHTM> That too
[04:58:38] <Cork> jessica__: try #html of #css
[04:58:48] <Cork> though they will most likely give you the same answer
[04:58:59] <deepy> There's #csslance no?
[04:59:07] <Cork> true
[04:59:19] <Cork> but then it will cost :)
[04:59:32] <jessica__> kk thnanks
[04:59:45] <jessica__> #html of #css , this is a complete name ?
[04:59:53] <Cork> uh...
[04:59:58] <WHTM> try the channel #html
[04:59:58] <Cork> its two separate channels
[04:59:59] <WHTM> or
[05:00:03] <WHTM> #css
[05:00:14] <jessica__> kk
[05:00:19] <jessica__> #html is not working
[05:00:27] <jessica__> thats y i came here for help
[05:00:36] <Cork> you need to register your nick
[05:00:41] <Cork> -NickServ- jessica__ is not registered.
[05:00:47] <jessica__> kk
[05:01:10] <Olive6767> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/jaZep/7/ indeed much better then my original code, though when you press spacebar right after the delay, the text changes then the fadeout occurs but without waiting the 1sec delay
[05:01:36] <Olive6767> at least on ff 19.0.2
[05:02:01] <topriddy> how to trigger a button click event on double click of an item in a select list?
[05:02:13] <Cork> Olive6767: http://jsfiddle.net/jaZep/8/
[05:02:25] <topriddy> i have two select list box, two buttons that does add and remove on click.
[05:02:44] <topriddy> developer who wrote it didnt add the dblclick items to it, now i want to add that
[05:03:06] <Cork> topriddy: if you can catch the dbclick just simulate the click on the buttom with trigger('click')
[05:04:19] <Cork> Olive6767: the first thing you want to do when you do the next action is to cancel the old one
[05:04:24] <Cork> else you have race risks
[05:06:03] <topriddy> Cork: please i do not understand how to fire/trigger the button click event, can you show an example please?
[05:06:21] <Cork> $('#button_id').trigger('click')
[05:06:32] <topriddy> Cork: thanks
[05:06:36] <Cork> np
[05:08:22] <Olive6767> Cork: ok, wouldn't have though to put the stop before the HTML update, thx again Cork :)
[05:08:40] <Cork> yw
[05:09:27] <topriddy> Cork: should i catch dblclick on select or on option?
[05:09:40] <topriddy> X_x
[05:09:51] <Cork> heh that is where i'm a bit unsure
[05:10:08] <Cork> i think some browsers (ie) doesn't let you bind events on option's
[05:10:25] <Cork> if that is true you will have to bind it on the select element
[05:10:30] <Anticom> howdy Cork :)
[05:10:32] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/kwxa3/
[05:10:35] <Anticom> no me gusta!
[05:10:38] <Anticom> why doesn't this work?
[05:10:39] <Cork> but as my memory is failing me i can't really tell
[05:11:03] <Cork> ?prop @ Anticom
[05:11:04] <bot-t> Anticom, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[05:11:11] <Anticom> ._.
[05:11:19] <Cork> prop('checked', true) prop('checked', false)
[05:11:22] <Cork> not attr
[05:11:34] <Anticom> so attr is obsolete?
[05:11:37] <Cork> no
[05:11:39] <Anticom> but it's still in the lib isn't it?
[05:11:40] <Cork> its for attributes
[05:11:44] <Cork> you want a property
[05:11:52] <Anticom> well, what's the difference?
[05:12:08] <Cork> attributes is what is the original data that was on the html
[05:12:14] <Anticom> properties are attributes where key=val
[05:12:17] <Anticom> aren't they?
[05:12:21] <Cork> property is live access to states in the browser
[05:12:36] <Cork> so ex. attr('checked') is what was set when the page loaded
[05:12:47] <Cork> prop('checked') is the current state
[05:12:57] <Anticom> but it i add an attribute <[...] checked="checked"/> to an input[type=radio] the browser shuold be able to detect that, shouldn't it?
[05:13:19] <Cork> only if the browser has monitors for attribute changes
[05:13:28] <Cork> and that they think it should override the users input
[05:13:33] <Cork> (and not all do)
[05:13:36] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/kwxa3/1/ still doesn't work tho ;)
[05:15:13] <Anticom> oops, had a typo, but still that wasn't the problem ( http://jsfiddle.net/kwxa3/2/ )
[05:16:18] <cusco> hi
[05:16:21] <Anticom> howdy
[05:16:38] <cusco> im using .accordion() on success: on a .ajax() call
[05:16:38] <Cork> Anticom: also give them a name
[05:16:59] <topriddy> Cork: please looking at this: $("input#btnAdd").trigger('click'); how does one choose what to use between double quotes and single quotes?
[05:16:59] <cusco> when I call ajax() second time, i'm using $(#accordion-id).empty()
[05:17:03] <Anticom> Cork in my original code they've got a name... just forgott that in the fiddle. but what should that change?
[05:17:04] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/kwxa3/3/
[05:17:19] <cusco> but then it doens't go into accordion anymore (because it was accordion'ed before?)
[05:17:19] <Cork> Anticom: if they do you don't need to touch the original
[05:17:25] <Anticom> grrrr i still can't ?p at someone :(
[05:17:31] <cusco> so... do I need to destroy the element and recreate it?
[05:17:36] <Cork> ?p @ Anticom
[05:17:37] <bot-t> Anticom, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:17:43] <Cork> you can't?
[05:17:51] <Anticom> i get: (13:17:12)- Calc:  = p @ cusco  --  (13:17:12)- Calc: Syntax Error
[05:18:03] <Cork> .p @ Anticom
[05:18:07] <Cork> ah
[05:18:16] <cusco> Anticom: so you wanted me to paste?
[05:18:16] <Anticom> no i'm typing "?p @ cusco"
[05:18:26] <cusco> ?p @ someone
[05:18:27] <bot-t> someone, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:18:28] <Cork> `? @ Anticom
[05:18:29] <cusco> works
[05:18:30] <Anticom> cusco yep, at jsfiddle
[05:18:35] <Cork> hmm
[05:18:38] <Cork> uggg
[05:18:40] <cusco> Anticom: ok hold..
[05:18:43] <Cork> `p @ Anticom
[05:18:44] <topriddy> how does one choose btw double and single quotes?
[05:18:50] <Cork> nope
[05:18:56] <Anticom> Cork in my browser (ff) your example still doesn't work
[05:19:01] <Cork> topriddy: its up to you
[05:19:22] <Cork> Anticom: strange it works in mine (chrome, firefox)
[05:19:22] <topriddy> they are one and same?
[05:19:23] <Braden`> Hello
[05:19:24] <Anticom> oh i see
[05:19:25] <Anticom> lol
[05:19:32] <topriddy> nothing like eval as in perl?
[05:19:37] <Anticom> it's my irc client trying to interpret ?p -.-
[05:19:40] <Cork> topriddy: nope
[05:19:44] <Braden`> Is there a way to create a loading screen that fits perfectly over top of an existing div?
[05:20:00] <Anticom> Cork running on WinXP 32 Bit - FF 19.0.2
[05:20:07] <Cork> Braden`: didn't i answer that a little while ago?
[05:20:15] <Braden`> http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#demos <-- That is sort of what I am trying to do, except I just want it to cover a single div
[05:20:23] <Cork> Anticom: is this about ?p or the fiddle?
[05:20:35] <Braden`> Cork:  I just joined.
[05:20:43] <Cork> scary...
[05:20:52] <Cork> i got the exact same question like 20 mins ago :D
[05:21:11] <Braden`> Oh really?  If you could, what was your reply?
[05:21:29] <cusco> Anticom: would be like this: http://jsfiddle.net/fPJyD/ but there s no reply from ajax obviously
[05:21:45] <Cork> Braden`: well i see that your trying to use a plugin for it
[05:21:54] <Anticom> Braden` http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/
[05:22:38] <cusco> but basically on the first ajax call, the $('#info') gets acordion'ed .. on the socond it doesn't
[05:22:39] <Cork> Braden`: i would prob go with just having an element in the page that i show
[05:22:49] <Anticom> hm
[05:23:07] <cusco> do I need to use .destroy() and recreate the element
[05:23:12] <cusco> before calling it again?
[05:23:18] <Anticom> doesn't make sense to me
[05:23:40] <cusco> Anticom: talking about my acordion issue?
[05:23:45] <cusco> what does not make sense?
[05:24:05] <Anticom> OH DANG Cork sorry it actually works in my browser aswell lol
[05:24:21] <Anticom> just assumed val=1 was the top one like it is in my actual code^^
[05:24:22] <Anticom> ty
[05:24:40] <Anticom> cusco yea, destroying the elem doesn't make sense to me
[05:25:05] <cusco> Anticom: but the element was already acordion'ed once so ...
[05:25:11] <cusco> how should I proceed?
[05:27:13] <sunbeam> hi, i've got some template, i would like to check if more sites use it.. I like to search by specific HTML that's been used.. Can I find this googling?
[05:27:15] <Braden`> Thanks
[05:27:21] <Braden`> I am reading the docs on it
[05:27:52] <Braden`> $(document).ready(function() {  <-- silly question, but how do I call that from a button?
[05:28:08] <Braden`> I don't get that it has a function name
[05:31:08] <sacho> name it
[05:31:41] <seutje> Braden`: var foo = function(){}; $(document).ready(foo); $('
[05:31:42] <Braden`> nm, I found it
[05:31:54] <Braden`> Thanks
[05:31:59] <seutje> Braden`: var foo = function(){}; $(document).ready(foo).on('click', 'button', foo);
[05:32:20] <seutje> note that the event parameter u get in the handler will be different for those 2 types of events
[05:33:28] <Dirkos> i have a block which i wanna move left, +=40 when the right key is pushed. But when i press and hold the key the slide seems way to fast
[05:33:30] <Dirkos> how do i solve this?
[05:34:19] <sacho> test case?
[05:34:28] <sacho> oh, I see what you mean
[05:34:42] <sacho> introduce a minimum interval between movements
[05:34:52] <sacho> you can save the time when you last moved, and check against it
[05:35:02] <sacho> holding down a key will produce a lot of keydowns
[05:35:20] <sacho> or rather keypresses(forgot the specifics)
[05:36:13] <Dirkos> hmm u have an example what u mean? The problem is here btw: http://svn.qreative-design.com/lolz/index2.php
[05:37:40] <HorizonXP> does anyone know why a $.post call with a success callback would not call the post function, but does call the success callback?
[05:37:47] <Braden`> Does anyone else get the error in firebug from jquery-1.9.1.js line 4242 ReferenceError: $ is not defined -- matches.call(div,"[s!='']:x");
[05:37:51] <HorizonXP> as in, I do not see the POST on my server
[05:38:11] <HorizonXP> but somehow, it's working, such that the callback is being fired
[05:40:08] <Braden`> nm.  I just changed the load order of the js files
[05:41:08] <sacho> HorizonXP, why don't you monitor it over your browser developer tools and see what is happening?
[05:50:03] <topriddy> thinking of possible ways to implement google suggest
[05:50:09] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/MNsLxR <-- TypeError: $(...).block is not a function
[05:50:36] <topriddy> I want the list of stuff in my <select> option list to be filtered based on what the users type
[05:55:34] <air_> topriddy: tested this one? http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[05:55:43] <sacho> Braden`, what plugin are you using for the block function?
[06:00:40] <topriddy> air_: awwwn. i'll look at that. i'm a fan of ivaynberg - the wicket guy!
[06:04:19] <Braden`> sacho:  http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/
[06:04:41] <Braden`> Oh duh
[06:04:45] <Braden`> I have to download the code
[06:04:53] <Braden`> Tonight is not my night...
[06:05:50] <Camusensei> hello guys :)
[06:06:47] <karthikselva> Hi guys I need help on jquerymobile with rails
[06:07:03] <Camusensei> I'm using jquery ui autocomplete, but $("#inputAutoComplete").select() doesn't work... has anyone an IDEA of where I should look for it to work?
[06:08:05] <karthikselva> I have a fixed toolbar at bottom of mobile which has a Play button. But on moving to different pages it creates different toolbars
[06:08:34] <karthikselva> So if I play a song on first page and the img.src is pause.png it does;t reflect on second page
[06:08:37] <karthikselva> please help
[06:13:43] <xec> ?demo @ Camusensei
[06:13:43] <b-ot> Camusensei: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:13:44] <bot-t> Camusensei, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:14:15] <xec> ?botsnack
[06:14:16] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[06:14:25] <xec> i thought maybe they were gonna fight for it
[06:15:56] <xec> karthikselva: if you want to preserve state between pages you can use something like localstorage or cookies
[06:16:14] <xec> mmmmmm cookies
[06:16:36] <Camusensei> xec: yes, I know I'm working on it :)
[06:17:51] <karthikselva> xec: yeah local storage would work but my problem it is able to preserve the state but once the new toolbar gets loaded the id still points to old toolbar changing that image
[06:18:06] <karthikselva> page1: has toolbar with #music_player
[06:18:24] <karthikselva> page2: also has toolbar with #music_player since it is a layout
[06:19:02] <karthikselva> now whenever I do $('#music)player').attr('src','pause.png') it sets on page 1 not on page 2
[06:19:14] <xec> karthikselva: define "page"?
[06:19:46] <xec> do you have a url to look at maybe?
[06:20:41] <karthikselva> https://github.com/karthikselva/music_cutter/blob/master/app/views/upload_song/_toolbar.mobile.erb#L56
[06:21:43] <karthikselva> i just did a ugly hot fix at end by executing script again
[06:21:58] <Camusensei> http://jsfiddle.net/XVTkE/ I'm using jquery ui autocomplete, but $("#autoComplete").select() doesn't work (in the select function of autocomplete)...
[06:24:18] <xec> Camusensei: what do you want do do?/what did you expect the .select() to do?
[06:25:03] <Camusensei> I expect the select() to select (highlight) the text after it has been selected in the drop-down list
[06:28:26] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/m4PPHE <-- When I click the register button, nothing happens.
[06:28:36] <Braden`> Firebug displays no errors
[06:29:12] <Lann> I need somebody to help unscrew me from some jank
[06:29:42] <Lann> I have an iframe submitting a form and i need a piece of jquery to not execute until form submission is complete. possible?
[06:30:03] <Braden`> Lann:  Use AJAX
[06:30:07] <Lann> i cant
[06:30:11] <Lann> it's a POST…hence the iframe hack
[06:30:19] <xec> Camusensei: looks like it's happening too early, as in the select() is fired before the text is inserted. with a small timeout it works http://jsfiddle.net/XVTkE/1/
[06:30:50] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/m4PPHE <-- When I click the register button, nothing happens.  Firebug displays no errors
[06:31:16] <Lann> i'd hate to just wait lol
[06:31:23] <Lann> i mean as in a timer
[06:31:45] <Lann> what executes within an iframe after it loads a document fully?
[06:31:56] <Camusensei> wow, you're right, thank you very much xec!
[06:33:00] <xec> Camusensei: mind you, thats a rather ugly workaround, maybe there's another event more suited
[06:33:51] <ravenzz> what about a custom event?
[06:33:51] <Camusensei> xec: and to find it I'll read the autocomplete code and see if I can find a hint. any idea on another less painful way of finding out?
[06:34:14] <ravenzz> setTimeout is not the best solution I think
[06:35:02] <xec> Camusensei: you could have a look at http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#events
[06:35:05] <Camusensei> hmmm, I'll try to put this in the close') function
[06:36:20] <Lann> ravenzz: for me?
[06:36:28] <ravenzz> for Camusensei
[06:36:45] <Lann> oh heh ok
[06:36:56] <Camusensei> ravenzz, xec: It works when I just put it in the close() function. Thank you very much for your help!!!
[06:37:20] <ravenzz> oh great
[06:39:13] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Lann
[06:39:13] <b-ot> Lann: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:39:14] <bot-t> Lann, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:39:27] <Lann> that is not possible in this case
[06:39:33] <Lann> well, not practical
[06:40:11] <Lann> because it's just a question. guess you didn't read it
[06:40:46] <jeffsmykil> can you get the itterator in .map?
[06:40:49] <jeffsmykil> is it available?
[06:43:16] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/m4PPHE <-- When I click the register button, nothing happens.  Firebug displays no errors
[06:43:26] <ravenzz> Lann do you mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzsF/
[06:44:02] <Lann> quite possibly. thanks
[06:44:28] <Lann> couldnt the iframe load before it binds in that casE?
[06:44:44] <Lann> not that it would in my case
[06:44:50] <Lann> i'm just saying theoretically
[06:45:30] <ravenzz> no, anyway notice that my script is running onLoad
[06:46:13] <Braden`> anyone?
[06:46:27] <Braden`> I am out of ideas on why this won't work
[06:46:44] <ravenzz> Lann this is the issue you might experience http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzsF/1/ here is the solution http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzsF/2/
[06:50:51] <Lann> ravenzz: this is sorta the wrong answer
[06:51:13] <Lann> because i'm not waiting for the frame src to load, i'm waiting for a form within the iframe to finish it's submission and therefore reload the contents of the iframe
[06:52:17] <zergion> Hi, I have an issue here. http://jsbin.com/eqepob/1 as I click on the p I want the <p> tag to change color. Then when I click it again it should go back to normal. Anyone can give me a finger in the right direction?
[06:52:50] <Camusensei> zergion: it works for me
[06:52:58] <zergion> Did you even read what I said?
[06:53:29] <zergion> Click me is a <p> tag I want to change colour on when click. It's like a css toggle
[06:53:39] <zergion> as long as the div is visible it should be colored
[06:53:44] <Camusensei> the "even" is rude, and yes I read. Afterwards however, I inspected the code and noticed it was not the <p> which changed color
[06:54:02] <Lann> its obvious that one should read stack before this channel
[06:54:14] <ravenzz> Lann oh ok so I misunderstood you, sorry my english is quite bad
[06:54:38] <Lann> ravenzz: no worries
[06:54:46] <ravenzz> Lann so are you actually making an ajax request within the iframe?
[06:54:53] <zergion> Camusensei: jsbin and jsfiddle makes me angry. They really suck :p
[06:54:57] <Lann> no, creating an iframe, creating a form, and then form.submit
[06:55:17] <pachet> Lann: you control the iframe?
[06:55:18] <Lann> in order to achieve a POST to an external site
[06:55:21] <ravenzz> is the form part of the parent document?
[06:55:43] <Lann> well after the submission the page is on a new domain
[06:55:56] <Lann> i was just wondering if there's any way to know when it completes
[06:56:14] <pachet> why not submit that POST with xhr
[06:56:14] <Lann> i'm tempted to just give a damn 5 second timer
[06:56:24] <pachet> then you can know for certain when it completes
[06:56:38] <Lann> xhr?
[06:56:45] <pachet> and do window.parent.postMessage() to notify the parent frame that the child's form post completed
[06:56:53] <pachet> Lann: $.ajax, in jquery-land
[06:57:25] <Lann> uh…ehr…i dunno i read somewhere that i cant do a cross domain post using that
[06:57:56] <ravenzz> pachet I believe he is doing something different... like this http://jsfiddle.net/6M3Nq/
[06:58:24] <Lann> like that except the form is inside of the iframe
[06:58:47] <ravenzz> what pachet said then
[06:58:53] <Lann> it's more or less a hack to achieve a cross domain post, if you really can post cross domain with $.ajax i'd rather use that
[06:59:02] <Camusensei> zergion: they also are an essential tool for sharing code ^^. So what you want to do is color (the background?) <p> when clicked on your jsbin?
[06:59:40] <Lann> well i suppose you could get on stack and answer questsions by asking them to jsfiddle it
[06:59:52] <Lann> that'd be fun
[07:00:17] <noregret> anybody uses bootpag plugin ?
[07:00:20] <zergion> The first time the <p> is clicked, the div fade in as intended. I also want the <p>Click me </p> to change color. When I click the <p>Click me</p> again, the div fades away, as intended and the color go back to normal.
[07:00:39] <zergion> and I dont like jsbin or jsfiddle because I cant copy or delete anything from it. I have to use the back -button on my keyboard.
[07:00:45] <pachet> Lann: and --- i joined late so im sorry if i'm rehashing --- you tried the obvious?
[07:00:58] <pachet> $('#myiframe').on('load.foo', fn)?
[07:01:16] <Lann> well, wont that execute on the initial iframe load too?
[07:01:21] <ravenzz> ..
[07:01:22] <ravenzz> no
[07:01:32] <ravenzz> I already showed you how to prevent it to happen
[07:01:50] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzsF/2/
[07:01:52] <Lann> i guess i can wait for load > 1
[07:01:52] <Lann> this is so hacky
[07:02:02] <ravenzz> ..
[07:02:02] <zergion> Camusensei it's a way to tell the user which div is currently visible by changing the appearance of <p>
[07:02:31] <Lann> yeah, you use default posting methods cross domain unless that domain has Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[07:02:35] <zergion> I tried using if statements but chrome returned rgb(...) and IE returned #color so it was just a mess
[07:02:43] <Lann> but you can make an iframe and submit the form…wtfh
[07:02:55] <Lann> what kind of half assed security is this
[07:03:17] <Lann> so instead of making it not work and be secure, i just have to do it in a hacky way
[07:04:03] <Lann> not that i'm doing something particularly white hat in the first place but it's not evil either
[07:04:14] <Lann> company wants to add items to a remote shopping cart in order to aggregate it
[07:04:30] <Lann> so i reverse engineered the remote cart and it works heh but i'm cleaning up some timing issues
[07:05:21] <LekeFly> i need to create a list of text that can scroll horizontal and with touch support, would i need to use something heavy like jquery or is it possible to have it with just javascript?
[07:05:27] <Lann> the lesson kiddies, tokenize your forms
[07:05:38] <Camusensei> zergion: you should not use if statements but rather tooglClass I'd say. Do you want me to do a fiddle?
[07:06:17] <Camusensei> (or a jsbin, it's the same I guess)
[07:07:19] <zergion> Sure, but can it be done without having to assign a class to p?
[07:07:48] <Lann> i think this is ultimately my issue. it's not possible to read the response from teh remote site's post call
[07:07:53] <Lann> and that's why it isnt supported normally
[07:09:44] <Camusensei> zergion: isn't this css class possible for you? .main-settings p.clicked{background-color: #444;}
[07:09:55] <Camusensei> zergion: (and please hl me when you answer)
[07:11:05] <Camusensei> zergion: by the way, the jsbin is this one: http://jsbin.com/eqepob/2
[07:14:43] <zergion> Camusensei works great, thank you
[07:14:58] <therealkoopa> Does anyone know of a plugin to find out if a bunch of divs are connected? I found http://brandonaaron.net/code/overlaps/demos, but I'm looking for something that would also return true for #four and #two in that example, since those divs are connected via #one
[07:16:32] <Camusensei> zergion: you're welcome :)
[07:19:39] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, somebody can give me a help with a thumbnails pagination I'm working on?? here's my example: http://hsinteractivo.com/visa/
[07:20:19] <mikehenriquez> left and right controllers works fine, thumbnails won't work as supposed and i don't know what more to do
[07:20:20] <mikehenriquez> :S
[07:23:40] <Wolf_22> I'm using EACH to iterate through each table TD I have in order to get to some links. The links are in a div that has a class of "foobar". So when I iterate through each TD, I then try to use children on $(this) to get .foobar. It's not working. Any ideas why?
[07:23:53] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: David Girrard ROFLSKATES
[07:24:02] <ajpiano> ouch
[07:24:06] <ajpiano> why you gotta play me like dat
[07:24:29] <jeffsmykil> I'm just jealous of your superior intellect so I make fun of the jets.  Im compensating
[07:24:31] <ajpiano> yup
[07:24:38] <ajpiano> oops wrong window on the yup
[07:24:41] <ajpiano> lolol
[07:24:45] <jeffsmykil> it applied ;)
[07:26:25] <jeffsmykil> the shone green error is over though ajpiano so I'm sure you are mourning
[07:26:35] <ajpiano> ha
[07:26:41] <ajpiano> i'm mostly bummed about leon washington -> patriots
[07:26:46] <jeffsmykil> "Jets determined to trade only good player"
[07:26:53] <jeffsmykil> yeah that I don't like at all
[07:27:03] <jeffsmykil> I hope welker catches 200 balls this year :-p
[07:27:31] <Rainb> why jQuery uses for(;;) instead of while() ?
[07:27:44] <BillCriswell> Wolf_22: I'm not sure I'm following. Are you trying to do $('table .foobar').each(function(){ doThingsTo($(this)); });
[07:28:14] <jeffsmykil> you can use while
[07:28:26] <BillCriswell> Rainb: Matter of taste.
[07:28:34] <Wolf_22> BillCriswill: I was basically trying to loop through each TD and then loop through each link inside the .foobar div that was inside each TD.
[07:29:06] <Wolf_22> BillCriswell: I managed to get it working using find().
[07:29:19] <jeffsmykil> some day I will meet you ajpiano and I will have a Mark Sanchez Starting Lineup figure for you
[07:29:46] <ajpiano> some day you are going to have a Mark Sanches Starting Lineup figure somewhere deep inside of your digestive system
[07:29:49] <ajpiano> :D
[07:30:03] <BillCriswell> Okie dokie.
[07:30:35] <jeffsmykil> I should go for the tri factor and try to find amare stoudemaire's and Carlos Beltran's
[07:30:54] <Rainb> is "for(;;)" faster than "while(1)"?
[07:31:05] <StephenS> no
[07:31:18] <QueueQueue> Wolf_22:  Like this?
[07:31:23] <QueueQueue> Wolf_22: http://jsfiddle.net/9pyHn/
[07:32:19] <Wolf_22> QueueQueue: Pretty much. Ha. Thanks!
[07:32:44] <QueueQueue> Wolf_22: No problem! :)
[07:35:16] <myosotis> how can I determine what type of dom element jQuery('.something'); is? assuming that only one element is selected.
[07:35:24] <myosotis> img, a, div, etc...
[07:35:32] <Gho5t> $('.foo').toggle(function(){ toggleItem(); }) === $('.foo').toggle(toggleItem) ?
[07:35:44] <amph1bius>   you can do it without jquery, use tagName
[07:35:54] <myosotis> thanks amph1bius
[07:35:55] <Lann> argh here's a fun one. I'm not so familiar with popup restrictions. I have a link that should pop up in a new window when clicked. But it needs to wait for other javascript events to fire first. This seems to trigger the popup blocker. What to do if my popup actually needs to fire on a different event than click?
[07:36:04] <amph1bius> or nodeName
[07:36:28] <Rainb> Why some people dont save jQuery arrays for later use?
[07:36:56] <sacho> they don't care about selection costs
[07:37:02] <Lann> user clicks "checkout" -> i do hackery to set up a remote cart in iframe -> javascript load event of iframe fires -> popup (blocked)
[07:37:09] <QueueQueue> @ Lann: Could you not have the on click call the methods that need to be done prior to the pop up launch and THEN call the pop up launch ?
[07:37:40] <Gho5t> azure is supposed to be language agnostic so I wouldn't feel to bad about not using it
[07:37:42] <Gho5t> $('.foo').toggle(function(){ toggleItem(); }) === $('.foo').toggle(toggleItem) ?
[07:37:50] <Gho5t> what do people always do the former?
[07:37:52] <QueueQueue> @ Lann : Don't attach the pop up launch as a separate event but an event at the end of the other sequence, if that makes sense
[07:38:05] <Lann> ...but
[07:38:11] <Lann> it needs to wait for said other event (load)
[07:38:26] <QueueQueue> is it an ajax call or something ?
[07:38:32] <Lann> yes and no
[07:38:41] <Lann> it's a post that's built within in iframe (remote post call hack)
[07:39:11] <Lann> but it still fires the iframe's load event
[07:39:17] <QueueQueue> so you want to wait until something happens within the iframe before its parent launches the pop up ?
[07:39:18] <Lann> i want the popup to occur after that load event
[07:39:24] <Lann> yeah
[07:39:47] <QueueQueue> is the iframe cross domain ?
[07:39:53] <Lann> "Checkout with remote site" (click) -> "setting up checkout…" -> load event fires -> popup
[07:39:54] <Lann> yes
[07:40:03] <QueueQueue> hmmm, makes things more ticky
[07:40:05] <QueueQueue> **tricky
[07:40:08] <Lann> yeah i know haha
[07:40:17] <Lann> i'd really like to use a popup
[07:40:39] <Lann> can i make the popup on click
[07:40:44] <Lann> go to a local loading page and then change its href?
[07:40:49] <QueueQueue> so just to clarify, you just want to wait until the iframe has finished loading. It doesn't do any JS events that you need to wait for ?
[07:41:00] <Lann> correct
[07:41:06] <Lann> i know i cant communicate with that iframe
[07:41:17] <spencerthayer> Morning y'all.
[07:41:34] <Lann> can i use the click event to make a temporary popup and change its href?
[07:41:38] <amaroks> spencerthayer: morning
[07:41:48] <Lann> err
[07:41:49] <amaroks> Lann: why not
[07:41:49] <Lann> url
[07:41:53] <Lann> that's what i'm thinking
[07:42:03] <Lann> now i know how those spam sites feel
[07:42:16] <QueueQueue> @Lann have you looked into the "onload" event? I haven't tested, but that may be the event you attach to the iframe that will call your pop up
[07:42:36] <Lann> anything other than click i'm pretty sure will be blocked
[07:42:52] <spencerthayer> I have a popup jQuery related problem myself. Small world. I'll shut up and listen, maybe mine'll get solved.
[07:42:58] <Lann> i mean, i dont know how that's working internally
[07:45:40] <Lann> well it seems my understanding is that you can popup within a click event handler and nowhere else
[07:45:45] <Lann> i dont know if that helps spencerthayer
[07:46:01] <Lann> only once and nowhere else in js
[07:46:08] <spencerthayer> You can use the jQuery popup plugin.
[07:46:24] <Lann> well if you're referring to like colorbox that's different
[07:46:28] <spencerthayer> No
[07:46:31] <spencerthayer> Let me be the link
[07:46:36] <oste> how can I select ALL form elements that have a name starting with 'my_form'?
[07:46:54] <Lann> but i'm pretty sure that browsers are enforcing it the way i've said
[07:47:41] <mg9831> This may be more of a javascript question, apologies if it is, but is there any way to get the absolute location of the javascript file from within the javascript file?
[07:47:50] <kristofers> Anyone have an idea how soundcloud's website works ?
[07:49:17] <QueueQueue> @Lann : this waits until after iframe load http://jsfiddle.net/P2prg/
[07:49:59] <Lann> …alert is not a popup
[07:50:27] <Lann> also i mean that's a totally different scenario
[07:50:36] <Lann> what's the obsession with incorrect jsfiddle answers here heh
[07:52:28] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, somebody can give me a help with a thumbnails pagination I'm working on?? here's my example: http://hsinteractivo.com/visa/
[07:52:29] <mikehenriquez>  left and right controllers works fine, thumbnails won't work as supposed and i don't know what more to do
[07:54:42] <spencerthayer> Sorry
[07:54:48] <spencerthayer> Had to talk to my boss.
[07:55:33] <spencerthayer> Here is my code which I am having a problem with. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15375980/advanced-jquery-popout-window and below in the second answer are links to Plugin 1: jQuery popupWindow Plugin 2: jQuery winPop.
[07:56:40] <oste> is this the proper way to remove an input value $('.input').val('');
[07:56:42] <spencerthayer> I am not certain those plugins could help you. I am not using them. Though I might try them out once I figure out my problems two through four.
[07:56:49] <QueueQueue> @Lann "obsession with incorrect answers?"... Not a very nice way to put things as you were the one that said you strictly wanted to launch a pop up with after an iframe load. Obviously my example uses an alert, but I am not doing the whole solution for you. You can still launch a pop up in place of where I put the alert.
[07:57:21] <Lann> no, you really cant
[07:57:28] * Lann plays a sad song on his jsfiddle
[07:59:11] <QueueQueue> @Lann Well, yes you can. But I don't feel inclined to assist you anymore based on your attitude.
[07:59:16] <Lann> there should be an irc stack exchange bridge
[07:59:28] <Lann> like @ask and @answer which gives reputation
[07:59:39] <spencerthayer> Yeah
[07:59:46] <Lann> that'd regulate on irc hard
[08:00:00] <spencerthayer> No it wouldn't.
[08:00:07] <spencerthayer> It would be useful.
[08:00:13] <Lann> it'd stop wrong answer
[08:00:32] <Lann> err well limit them
[08:00:43] <spencerthayer> People would still give you the wrong answer. It would just help you figure out which person to listen to .
[08:00:50] <Lann> well that's my point
[08:01:01] <Lann> also it'd give incentive to answer questions
[08:01:07] <spencerthayer> So I am using $('#video').detach(); when the user initiates a pop out. I do this because in Firefox $('#chat').fadeToggle(500); doesn't actually remove the embedded player and you get a crazy echo when the user pops the video out.
[08:01:25] <Lann> only there's  no inecentive to write the bot
[08:01:49] <spencerthayer> Any ideas how to bring the player back using jquery?
[08:02:13] <spencerthayer> Or rather. How do you restore and embedded player after .detach()?

[08:02:34] <therealkoopa> Does anyone know of a plugin to find out if a bunch of divs are connected? I found http://brandonaaron.net/code/overlaps/demos, but I'm looking for something that would also return true for #four and #two in that example, since those divs are connected via #one
[08:06:36] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:07:25] <QueueQueue> Hello!
[08:07:52] <jomofcw> What's the easiest way to do "blink" effect on an element (i.e. from opacity 100 to opacity 0 to opacity 100 to opacity 0 to opacity 100), please ?
[08:08:12] <jomofcw> *to do a "blink" a=effect
[08:09:31] <aMoniker> jomofcw: you can chain calls to $.animate() or use a CSS animation
[08:09:38] <QueueQueue> @jomofcw, you can use the fadein effect from jquery along with the fadeout. There is a complete attribute for each of those. Call the other one in the complete event
[08:10:30] <jomofcw> Ok thanks I'll try =)
[08:10:46] <jeffsmykil> jomofcw: i think there is a pulse
[08:11:10] <jeffsmykil> maybe I'm imagining that
[08:11:18] <jomofcw> The best solution using jQuery UI : http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Pulsate
[08:11:27] <jomofcw> jeffsmykil ^^
[08:12:05] <jeffsmykil> yeah thaw what i used
[08:12:36] <QueueQueue> Even better :)
[08:14:31] <DarkAceZ> <Cork> DarkAceZ: same is true for live
[08:14:32] <DarkAceZ> watttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
[08:14:59] <DarkAceZ> how can one mis-tab-complete so many times in a row and not seem to notice? :P
[08:17:06] <QueueQueue> @ DarkAceZ lack of coffee ?
[08:17:35] <DarkAceZ> lol
[08:21:04] <Maverick|MSG> was there a change today where http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css no longer is valid
[08:22:01] <Maverick|MSG> before you could use '1' as the version and you'd get the latest version
[08:24:01] <jomofcw> I cant to get all first UL in the DIV.myClass how can I do it ? $('div.myClass ul:first') just retun the first UL of the first DIV.myClass, not the other.
[08:25:10] <QueueQueue> @jomofcw something like   $('div.myClass ul:first').each(function(){ //DO WHATEVER });
[08:32:09] <seutje> jomofcw: $('div.myClass > ul:first-child')

[08:59:52] <superdo> hi, what plugin pattern do you recommend for a  mid-size plugin?
[09:01:20] <Lann> 2 metallic connectors in parralel with a circular gound connection beneath them
[09:02:15] <bergamot> I see what you did there, a shocking suggestion....

[09:04:35] <djj_> If i have a simple table like the following: http://i.imgur.com/306jUHW.png is it possible to highlight a number of cells?
[09:05:45] <bergamot> Dirkos, holding down one of the arrow keys seems to take him the distance, so I'm not sure it's on keyup...
[09:06:10] <bergamot> it might just be a delay in processing that makes it seem not instantenous, but then again I'm on some shitty work PC, so that might just be me.
[09:08:15] <djj_> Is it possible to drag and highlight a number of cells

[09:09:58] <martinrame> hi, i'm trying to replace xmlhttprequest v2 with jquery, but I found it doesn't support responsetype == arraybuffer, do you know a workaround?
[09:11:19] <chinoto> if I have "$(callback1);$(callback2);", will callback2 definitely fire after callback1?
[09:12:30] <defaultr0> morning folks, do you track your website like using google analytics or piwik, etc?
[09:12:32] <pachet> chinoto: yes
[09:13:26] <pachet> martinrame: this is an old link, but it highlights the basics:
[09:13:27] <pachet> http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/javascript/jquery-binary-ajax.html
[09:13:38] <pachet> i'd recommend just using a thin xhr wrapper though
[09:15:27] <martinrame> pachet: yes, I've found that link, but I'm using jquery 1.9.1, and I don't know if the patch can be applied...

[09:16:02] <martinrame> pachet: regarding the thin xhr wrapper, can you point me to something to start with?
[09:16:14] <alainus> any tips ?
[09:16:20] <stephan_> Is that a BUG or a Feature of jqm-1.3.0-Rc.1 ?? Watch the HTML of an input field with firebug; then double/triple klick in the input area,  --> JQM starts adding hidden inputs to the dom with the same name, type="hidden"  -> try here: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/forms/textinputs/
[09:16:55] <chinoto> pachet: good, because I have a function that is called from an iframe that I'm not sure will occur after ready(), so part of the function is wrapped in "$(function(){})"
[09:19:02] <kristofers> i have a table where at first there is one row, and then you can dynamically add more if needed
[09:19:09] <kristofers> how do i go about make the the field A and B = C
[09:19:14] <kristofers> right now the first row works
[09:19:27] <kristofers> but the second row is takign the total of A + B from the first ROW

[09:19:45] <stephan_> It does not happen jqm-1.2.0
[09:19:45] <stephan_> nor in 1.3.0
[09:21:24] <pachet> martinrame: https://github.com/p-m-p/xhr2-lib looks like it supports arraybuffer
[09:21:28] <pachet> havent used it though

[09:25:21] <norm> is there a Better Way to write $("container child.selector").size() > 0

[09:36:36] <chilversc_> stephan_: it appears to come from the function, maybeCreateHiddenInput
[09:38:40] <superdo> am I right with newest modernizr i dont need respond.js anymore? or it isnt built in
[09:39:48] <chilversc_> stephan_: it was a bug, but it's been fixed in the 1.3 release, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ae3484b
[09:40:01] <stephan_> chilversc_: Thank you!
[09:40:21] <stephan_> couldn't find any info on that one
[09:40:31] <stephan_> so i have to use 1.3.0 for release ;)
[09:40:44] <stephan_> thought the rc1 would be more "stable"
[09:40:49] <chilversc_> why?
[09:40:57] <chilversc_> rc1 == release candidate 1
[09:41:49] <stephan_> which one should I prefer  ? 1.3.0 or 1.3.0rc1 ?
[09:42:09] <chilversc_> stephan_: the actual release rather than the release candidate
[09:42:19] <stephan_> yep! thank you!
[09:42:30] <stephan_> was unclear to me ;)
[09:45:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> any DOS experts?
[09:46:32] <gordian> anyone know a good lazy image loading plugin that doesn't require markup changes?
[09:48:50] <anew> is anyone using require.js ?
[09:49:15] <alainus> I'm trying to achieve jQuery.Parallax responsiveness on http://ur1.ca/d2l4k, using the same configuration as in the demo http://stephband.info/jparallax/demos/target.html, but upon resizing the window, the absolute position of the parallax layers shift left unproportionally if there isn't a window reload. See (Full) http://i.imgur.com/is2CCfn.jpg (Resized) http://i.imgur.com/uDsDOub.png (Reloaded) http://i.imgur.com/bjqRggJ.jpg. Any tips?
[09:49:29] <anew> if you are using require.js and want page specific js, that's not possible correct
[09:50:27] <alainus> any?
[09:50:54] <alainus> your change is my code
[09:52:18] <chilversc_> anew: why not?
[09:53:00] <anew> dont know, i thought everything should be loaded via require.  chilversc_ if you want like page specific you have to write script tags in the html correct
[09:53:24] <kamo> anew: I have started using Modernzr to do mostly what RequireJs does
[09:53:50] <chilversc_> anew: you can do that, or you could have a page specific js file that only that page includes
[09:53:52] <kamo> Modernzr.load with Yep/Nope
[09:53:55] <chilversc_> anew: either work fine
[09:54:03] <anew> i mean i have one <script> file which loads require.js.  my question is should all my js be inside this require.js file
[09:54:32] <yousaf> I want a button, when a user clicks on the button I want to inject text in their clipboard. Can this be done?
[09:54:34] <anew> how do you page specific with require? not possible (if we are not using routers/backbone)
[09:54:38] <chilversc_> anew: no, that's the actual require.js library, your js should be in other files, with one main file to bootstrap it
[09:54:39] <yyyq> hi. is there a way to run javascript like this in jquery $("#id").show(0).delay(1000).javascriptfunction("test"); ?
[09:54:47] <anew> right i asked that question wrong
[09:54:59] <anew> chilversc_ i have my main.js file which loads my modules
[09:55:04] <anew> and from there i load my app.js or whatever
[09:55:04] <chilversc_> anew: as for page specific, that's just a case of having a page specific javascript file to bootstrap that page
[09:55:18] <anew> ok from these files, there is no way to do page specific without routers right
[09:55:37] <chilversc_> sure there is
[09:55:38] <anew> i.e every single page i'm loading if require.js is in the header is loading all my js files
[09:55:40] <anew> is that correct
[09:56:05] <chilversc_> no, require.js will only load the file you tell it to, if that file then tells it to load other files, that's it's decision
[09:56:22] <anew> ok that's the part i dont get
[09:56:30] <anew> how per page do i tell require.js to load what files i want
[09:57:03] <chilversc_> anew: many ways, have a per-page bootstrap file instead of main.js
[09:57:07] <nocturne7> when I make an ajax call, the browser's scroll gets pushed up, how can I prevent this ?
[09:57:16] <anew> but if my js is only loaded in the header this is not possible
[09:57:21] <anew> header is loaded every page
[09:57:30] <anew> ok so you are telling me somewhere in the body put a per page bootstrap
[09:57:32] <anew> is this correct
[09:57:53] <chilversc_> anew: no, you can still put it in the header
[09:57:58] <anew> wut
[09:58:02] <anew> how? php ?
[09:58:07] <anew> by reading url ?
[09:58:42] <chilversc_> anew: just put, <script data-main="scripts/page-foo.js" src="scripts/require.js"></script> instead of the standard main.js
[09:59:06] <anew> right right, but if that goes in the header this loads on every page the header is on
[09:59:24] <chilversc_> anew: so only include that particular line, in the header for the file that needs it
[09:59:35] <anew> right
[09:59:37] <anew> ok
[09:59:42] <anew> so this leads to my next question lol
[09:59:52] <anew> if i am including ALL my js files in one main.js
[09:59:55] <anew> that is slow isnt it ?
[09:59:58] <anew> or is that normal thing to do ?
[10:00:23] <chilversc_> depends really how large that file is, and how much of it is used
[10:00:48] <chilversc_> as doing loads of really small requests to fetch the scripts piecemeal is slow, so doing one single request to fetch everything can be faster
[10:00:56] <chilversc_> unless everything is really big
[10:04:59] <newtonianb> if I'm using jquery, what's the advantage of using a form container vs a plain div?
[10:05:14] <newtonianb> does it really matter besides the default submit button behavior on a form
[10:05:43] <skope> newtonianb: think of the users who do not use javascript
[10:06:09] <newtonianb> skope: is that a realistic scenario?
[10:06:33] <skope> newtonianb: might be
[10:06:36] <newtonianb> the majoority of site is in pure JS with ember so this site wouldn't be for them anyways :)
[10:07:03] <skope> there is always nice to have some fallback
[10:07:12] <newtonianb> right
[10:16:53] <jaagr> that swimming bird....
[10:17:11] <buscapepe> any suggestions for a jquery (mobile) plugin that scales pictures depending to screen-size and is capable to display these pictures full-screen (e.g. on tap)?
[10:23:09] <Shawn_> Hey.. anyone here used jquery.ajax with the Q promise library?
[10:26:20] <ZeroBeholder> so, I'm working with an older guy-- older than my dad, not quite as old as my grampa -- I'm in my 30's. Perspective, just for you.
[10:26:45] <jaagr> ?
[10:27:04] <ZeroBeholder> He has built a tool using php and has two layers of iframes for same origin content...
[10:27:04] <systemfault> ZeroBeholder: Congratulations
[10:27:24] <ZeroBeholder> Selectors are being... fun.
[10:27:33] <ZeroBeholder> Maybe there is a better way.
[10:28:22] <albemuth> how come there's no $(selector).isEmpty() that can be used instead of $(selector).length !==0
[10:28:42] <aMoniker> how would that be faster than length?
[10:29:41] <albemuth> just cleaner/more convenient
[10:29:50] <aMoniker> you don't have to check that length !== 0 anyway, you can just do if (!$(selector).length) {…}
[10:32:41] <Gho5t> I don't like that
[10:32:54] <Gho5t> doesn't make the intention clear
[10:33:07] <aMoniker> it's pretty clear
[10:33:11] <buscapepe> just write it yourself, its not that hard
[10:33:17] <Gho5t> it's not clear
[10:33:25] <Gho5t> .length === 0
[10:33:27] <Gho5t> which is falsey
[10:33:37] <Gho5t> so it converts to false
[10:33:45] <Gho5t> it's not a boolean by itself
[10:34:04] <aMoniker> if the length is zero, zero is false in js
[10:34:18] <Gho5t> I just explained why that is
[10:34:27] <aMoniker> it's like testing that a string isn't empty
[10:34:46] <Gho5t> you're missing my piont
[10:34:59] <ZeroBeholder> I thought I was on to something with: $('#fb-iframe-b22_01_a_howard_hanna').contents().find('#fb-iframe-b22_01_a_login_howardhanna').contents().find('#fb_fld-361192').html();
[10:34:59] <Gho5t> I'm not saying it doesn't work
[10:35:03] <Gho5t> I thought I made that pretty clear
[10:35:12] <aMoniker> You're saying it isn't clear. I disagree.
[10:35:35] <Guddu> Could someone explain to me what is meant by this statement? "As of jQuery 1.8, however, the .ajaxStop() method should only be attached to document."
[10:35:38] <Gho5t> you're not sure why
[10:35:48] <Gho5t> so you explain that "0 is false in js"
[10:35:53] <aMoniker> Gho5t: I have no idea how your mind operates that would make it unclear.
[10:35:55] <ZeroBeholder> But I am wrong. Using jQuerify firebug plugin, but says contents() is not a function.
[10:36:18] <dcherman> Guddu: it means don't do $( "#foo" ).ajaxStop()
[10:36:29] <Gho5t> aMoniker: nvm man you're not ready for academic discussion
[10:36:34] <Guddu> dcherman, So it will operate at global document level only
[10:36:39] <aMoniker> Gho5t: Go away.
[10:36:42] <dcherman> Guddu: correct
[10:36:46] <Gho5t> aMoniker: no
[10:37:09] <Guddu> dcherman, I am planning to use ajaxstart and ajaxstop for showing and hiding spipnneer gif indicating ajax requests is in process :)
[10:37:25] <albemuth> aMoniker > 2013, being angry on irc
[10:37:43] <aMoniker> > 2013?
[10:37:48] <Guddu> dcherman, If there are multiple users on the website then ajaxstart will look for pending requests only for individual browser sessions right?
[10:37:56] <aMoniker> I'm not angry.
[10:38:17] <ZeroBeholder> How would any of you tackle this unique working bad code situation where the information is two levels deep in an iframe?
[10:38:18] <anew> y u mad tho?
[10:38:19] <b-ot> anew: (屮'Д')屮
[10:38:23] <dcherman> Guddu: of course.  javascript only runs on one client at a time.  it will not detect requests made on someone elses machine.

[10:39:50] <jaagr> can't even see what that is supposed to be
[10:39:57] <dcherman> Gho5t: why do you feel that it's unclear?  any js dev above beginner should understand truthiness and falsiness
[10:40:04] * jaagr sure knows how to rhyme tho!
[10:40:37] <ZeroBeholder> For a half a second, I was confused. It is all clear now anew. And yes, it is pretty cool. http://memegenerator.net/Y-U-No

Could someone help me?
[10:50:06] <Beam> yo
[10:50:14] <Beam> any pointers where to get started with jquery.mobile?
[10:50:31] <otters> constrainInput on a jQuery UI datepicker with dateFormat set to "M d yy" is allowing any character
[10:50:37] <otters> why is this
[10:50:49] <dcherman> Gho5t: so it's a style preference then.  neither style is more/less correct, so long as you're consistent in your own codebase.
[10:50:49] <Beam> i'm having trouble with form submitting and how to reload the page with some links? or am i never supposed to do a full reload?
[10:51:26] <Gho5t> I wouldn't say "making intentions clear" is a style
[10:51:33] <Gho5t> a stylistic choice rather
[10:51:38] <Gho5t> more of a trait of a good programmer
[10:51:43] <Gho5t> but yeah, that is my opinion
[10:52:35] <Gho5t> I also can't stand this: $(function(){
[10:52:45] <Gho5t> when I first saw that I had to take a few mins to google it
[10:52:50] <Gho5t> and make sure the guy using it didn't goof
[10:52:54] <Gho5t> for what?
[10:53:05] <Gho5t> to save a few chars he needs to confuse everyone that hasn't seen that before
[10:53:53] <aMoniker> Gho5t: you must never use regexes
[10:54:04] <Gho5t> how is that a valid point
[10:54:13] <aMoniker> it's half a joke
[10:54:14] <systemfault> That's a really interesting discussion… not.
[10:54:28] <Gho5t> i don't get it
[10:54:32] <Gho5t> sorry
[10:54:37] <Gho5t> I use regexes plenty
[10:54:39] <aMoniker> well, regexes are usually complex, and don't convey intention well
[10:54:50] <aMoniker> you need specialized knowledge to read them
[10:54:53] <otters> Oh, you can't constrain input if the date format contains M
[10:54:55] <Gho5t> there isn't really a way around that
[10:55:00] <otters> apparently - and & are valid month name characters
[10:55:02] <otters> how odd
[10:55:26] <dcherman> Gho5t: understanding the language isn't a stylistic choice imo.  that said, i see your point, it's just a matter of opinion.
[10:57:32] <Gho5t> systemfault: what is your opinion
[10:58:51] <systemfault> Gho5t: I personally agree with you, code should be as explicit as possible but I respect people with a different opinion.
[10:59:51] <systemfault> Perhaps it's my background with statically-typed languages that makes me think this way.
[11:00:02] <Gho5t> maybe mine too
[11:00:14] <Gho5t> or maybe too many Crockford videos
[11:00:20] <systemfault> Haha :P
[11:00:23] <Gho5t> : )
[11:00:36] <systemfault> Crockford is a bit crazy
[11:00:49] <Gho5t> he is nazi-esque at times
[11:01:00] <systemfault> Nobody can deny he did a great difference in the revival of JS.
[11:01:01] <shoky> reading "if (bla.length)"  you just don't know right away if the intention was to check if the array is empty, or whether the .length property is defined&truthy.  being pro at JS will not help.
[11:01:05] <shoky> it's about being expressive
[11:01:28] <Gho5t> good example
[11:01:43] <aMoniker> shoky: those two things are the same
[11:01:58] <shoky> aMoniker: they are totally different
[11:02:00] <Gho5t> how
[11:02:06] <aMoniker> either empty/undefined, or defined/truthy
[11:02:08] <aMoniker> same test
[11:02:16] <shoky> different intention
[11:02:30] <aMoniker> and on a jQuery selector, in this case, you'd be checking if the array is empty
[11:02:34] <systemfault> shoky: Why I prefer being explicit…That specific case is not an issue for me as C.. C++.. and a bunch of other languages use 0 as falsy and any other number as truthy.
[11:02:35] <shoky> obviously the test is the same, or you wouldnt be having this discussion
[11:02:43] <systemfault> s/Why/While
[11:04:11] <shoky> yeah i'm sure it's not an issue for any of us, but "not being an issue for me" does not === nice code
[11:04:21] <aMoniker> define nice code
[11:05:00] <shoky> why?
[11:05:03] <shoky> i just said what it is not
[11:05:07] <shoky> that's all i wanted to say
[11:05:14] <systemfault> aMoniker: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ReadsLikeProse :P
[11:05:24] <scalex000> hello, I try to create tabs I follow the example, the only thing I add is a table
[11:05:27] <systemfault> I rock.
[11:05:30] <scalex000> its posible?
[11:05:48] <systemfault> Gho5t: See that link too :P
[11:05:56] <shoky> and fwiw i usually skip the "=== 0"
[11:05:57] <shoky> ;]
[11:06:04] <aMoniker> systemfault: I like that style, which is why I wouldn't use the === operator in that case
[11:06:19] <shoky> fully aware that the code is less expressive, and fully not giving a shit
[11:06:37] <aMoniker> "If no selector length" vs. "If selector length is not equal to zero"
[11:07:03] <aMoniker> or, equal to zero in this case
[11:07:18] <Gho5t> my issue is that I don't know if you screwed up by writing that
[11:07:27] <Gho5t> if(foo.someNumber)
[11:07:33] <Gho5t> how do I know what your intention was here
[11:07:47] <aMoniker> Gho5t: to be fair, you don't know if I screwed up by making the test specific either
[11:08:06] <Gho5t> but I know what your intention was : )
[11:08:11] <Gho5t> and with that
[11:08:15] <Gho5t> I will take my trophy and leave
[11:08:31] <aMoniker> If you can't read the intention from the shorter statement… read more javascript :)
[11:08:43] <Gho5t> hrm
[11:08:48] <Gho5t> there is no intention
[11:08:54] <Gho5t> that is my point
[11:09:03] <Gho5t> no intention to possibly derive from that little info
[11:09:06] <Gho5t> rather
[11:09:13] <aMoniker> except for "If no selector length"
[11:09:27] <Gho5t> my example was if(foo.someNumber)
[11:09:34] <aMoniker> ok
[11:09:51] <aMoniker> if someNumber exists and isn't falsy
[11:09:53] <aMoniker> or in this case, 0
[11:09:58] <aMoniker> since someNumber would ostensibly be a number
[11:10:05] <ZeroBeholder> What I don't understand is why I am getting SOP problems, all the iframes are served from the same domain.
[11:10:26] <Gho5t> you know what my point is
[11:10:30] <Gho5t> let's not keep doing this
[11:10:39] <BillCriswell> It sounds like I missed a silly argument. Damn.
[11:10:45] <aMoniker> It was a silly argument.
[11:10:48] <Gho5t> oh yes a doozy
[11:10:53] <dcherman> ZeroBeholder: do you control all the iframes?
[11:10:59] <ZeroBeholder> Yes.
[11:11:00] <dcherman> meaning the contents of them
[11:11:14] <dcherman> set the document.domain property
[11:11:19] <shoky> ZeroBeholder:  same origin? (same protocol/subdomain/etc) ?
[11:11:39] <ZeroBeholder> I tried that. Yes, all same subdomain. Wayne doesn't know DNS.
[11:11:47] <aMoniker> Gho5t: also you should really put a space after your if() - like if ()
[11:11:50] <aMoniker> otherwise, how do I know it's not a function?
[11:11:52] <aMoniker> ;)
[11:12:13] <ZeroBeholder> jQuerify could be part of the problem, the jQuery I am running comes from the firebug plugin...
[11:12:19] <Gho5t> because it has "if" before it
[11:12:24] <shoky> you can call a function with a space
[11:12:35] <ZeroBeholder> (Yeah, no jQuery in the source. It's been difficult.)
[11:12:37] <aMoniker> yes, is joke
[11:13:36] <ZeroBeholder> I do not have SFTP or CLI access. Wayne also doesn't know how to add users to his system.
[11:14:25] <Gho5t> you tell Wayne to figure it out
[11:14:30] <ZeroBeholder> It's been 3 months of little tasks here and there freelance. I'm still not sure what kind of *nix it is.
[11:17:04] <bergoglio_> is it fine to validate like this in my ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/k8ttp/
[11:17:47] <Gho5t> no
[11:18:05] <ZeroBeholder> console.log($('#fb-iframe-b22_01_a_howard_hanna').css("background-color","#555555")); works
[11:18:08] <StephenS> no
[11:18:17] <ZeroBeholder> console.log($('#fb-iframe-b22_01_a_howard_hanna').contents().find('#fb-iframe-b22_01_a_login_howardhanna').css("background-color","#555555")); does not
[11:18:24] <bergoglio_> damn
[11:18:36] <ZeroBeholder> Error: Permission denied to access property 'ownerDocument'
[11:18:59] <bergoglio_> any suggestions?
[11:19:44] <ZeroBeholder> bergoglio_: I'm new to validation myself, but google jquery validator. So far it's been good to me.
[11:20:20] <ZeroBeholder> bergoglio_: they have the 'required' flag which seems to be what you are testing for.
[11:20:20] <Gho5t> bergoglio_: it appears that you're validating if name is set after you send the ajax request
[11:20:38] <Gho5t> why not validate first and then conditionally make the request
[11:22:00] <ZeroBeholder> bergoglio_: it's raw with very little CSS, but it works https://d4.senditsocial.com/vendorregister/ .
[11:22:05] <bergoglio_> Gho5t:  otherwide it will refresh the page
[11:22:14] <Gho5t> return false
[11:24:29] <bergoglio_> ZeroBeholder:  will take a look
[11:26:50] <bergoglio_> Gho5t:  like this http://jsfiddle.net/k8ttp/1/ ?
[11:27:23] <scar> so i have a small boxed div with a div the same size on top of it, but moved to the left and top so only 25px x 25px shows. now when i do hover, i have it animate positons to be in full view. when it mouseouts, it moves it baack. problem is, is there a way to "disable" the "mouse over" while it's currently moused over?
[11:30:39] <BrandonE> http://slexy.org/view/s21GQBg4hA - this works for 4 out of 5 iframes on my PHP generated page...each time I generate it, it's the same slot that has a problem. This is an example of one that doesn't work: http://slexy.org/view/s2kZOnyfA1
[11:30:52] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/BfuS7/2/ - have a small accordion, trying to have a combo of accordion + open classes open the first panel of the accordion by default, but it's just not cooperating, and is also screwing up another class combo I have setup: toggle - can anyone see what's wrong?
[11:34:16] <ZeroBeholder> feyd: So, it looks like when I click on panel 2 or 3 in the first group, the first will open with it-- if the first isn't open already.
[11:34:45] <ZeroBeholder> feyd: is this the desired function? The second group functions differently.
[11:34:49] <feyd> ZeroBeholder: yea, only on one that has the 'toggle' class, it's just being goofy when 'open' is combined with 'toggle', I just dont see what's in my code that would cause that behavior
[11:35:05] <feyd> and open just doesn't work, and again, I'm not sure why it's not
[11:37:18] <ZeroBeholder> feyd: might it have something to do with using dl,dt,dd ?
[11:37:38] <feyd> dont see why
[11:38:00] <ZeroBeholder> I've seen them, but never used them. Have you tried this with just divs?
[11:38:15] <feyd> the elements dont matter at all
[11:38:18] <feyd> really
[11:38:18] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/5Fh9Q/
[11:38:29] <TrentonDAdams> Good day.  I'm attempting to do a json post request.  I submit parameters, and the result is json.  I've confirmed by capturing the http request with a live headers plugin, and posting it manually through telnet.  It does in fact respond with json.  So, I'm trying to figure out why jQuery would throw an error that simply says "error"
[11:38:30] <kristofers> in the top fields
[11:38:41] <kristofers> add a few row
[11:38:49] <kristofers> and put 100 in the first field, 120 in the second
[11:39:49] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: Is the service returning JSON on the same exact domain as the page doing the $.post?
[11:40:18] <feyd> ZeroBeholder: block level elements are block level elements, the only differences between using a div here and a dl/dt/dd here is that dl has specific children, like ul/ol and by default has a margin applied. None of those things would interfere with the behavior of jquery
[11:40:22] <TrentonDAdams> No, it's returning json on a domain that I'm making the request to.
[11:40:34] <TrentonDAdams> systemfault: ^^
[11:40:44] <TrentonDAdams> i.e. a different domain.
[11:41:05] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, wait, I get it, let me see.
[11:41:19] <kristofers> I guess i understand the problem but i'm lost on how i should write it so it doesn't put the same everywhere
[11:41:23] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: Unless you use CORS, you're limited to the same domain.
[11:41:50] <TrentonDAdams> systemfault: I'm not sure what you're asking exactly. I make an ajax request to validator.w3.org, and the response is json.
[11:42:29] <TrentonDAdams> So, are you saying that the page itself must be the same domain as the one I'm doing an ajax request to?
[11:42:32] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: The browser XMLHttpRequest object can only contact the same domain because of the "Same-Origin Policy"
[11:42:40] <TrentonDAdams> Oh.
[11:42:53] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: Yes, unless you implement CORS… which only works on more recent browsers.
[11:43:11] <TrentonDAdams> So, the script would have had to have been loaded from validator.w3.org in order to work?  Cause google analytics does this all the time.
[11:43:57] <TrentonDAdams> Hmm, it would be nice if the error message was a little clearer.  Like maybe mentioning the same origin policy.
[11:43:57] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: The validator can do whatever it wants from the server-side
[11:44:09] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: The server-side doesn't have any limitation.
[11:44:43] <TrentonDAdams> No, what I'm saying, is that the ajax query would work fine, IF the script running it was actually loaded from that domain.  Correct?  Cause, as I mentioned, google analytics sends data to it's domain all the time.
[11:45:35] <TrentonDAdams> Or, are you saying that other servers are not allowed to return "http" responses other than headers?
[11:46:20] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: open ga.js and read it… it's crazy the amount of hacks it does to get info.
[11:46:46] <kristofers> Can anyone point me in the right direction, http://jsfiddle.net/5Fh9Q/ add a few row, put 100 in the 1st field, 120 in the 2nd and watch what happens
[11:46:48] <systemfault> TrentonDAdams: It can use iframes.. script tags.. images… flash even..
[11:47:22] <TrentonDAdams> I'm sad. :D
[11:47:47] <TrentonDAdams> I wanted to make w3 validation on ajax snippets work.  I still can, but I'm forced to install the w3 validator on the very same host.
[11:48:39] <TrentonDAdams> Ahh, actually, I could just point apache proxy to a copy installed somewhere on our network.
[11:48:51] <TrentonDAdams> mod_proxy that is.
[11:57:11] <anew> so another question about require.js ... wouldnt you run into problems with div id's that have the same name ?
[11:57:20] <anew> so every single div on the entire site has to have a different name ?
[11:57:37] <BrandonE> http://slexy.org/view/s21GQBg4hA - this works for 4 out of 5 iframes on my PHP generated page...each time I generate it, it's the same slot that has a problem. This is an example of one that doesn't work: http://slexy.org/view/s2kZOnyfA1

[12:56:31] <eugenmayer> is there a way to json encode an object with jq? parseJSON is for decoding, is there any inverse of it?
[12:58:34] <scar> so i have a small boxed div with a div the same size on top of it, but moved to the left and top so only 25px x 25px shows. now when i do hover, i have it animate positons to be in full view. when it mouseouts, it moves it baack. problem is, is there a way to "disable" the "mouse over" while it's currently moused over?
[12:58:36] <eugenmayer> sorry, solved.
[12:59:03] <gordian> scar: post a fiddle
[13:00:14] <scar> gordian, ok but let me rephrase my question:
[13:00:26] <scar> gordian, if the user moves mouse in and out faster than the delay
[13:00:28] <gordian> how bout post a fiddle then rephrase
[13:00:31] <scar> ok
[13:00:32] <gordian> ;-)
[13:00:36] <eugenmayer> expecting you guys also write some/alot coffee script, i have a short syntax questions i often encountering writng jquery code with coffee : http://jsfiddle.net/eGeF2/ .. is there a way to just get rid of the paranethesis arround on? if i skip those, i get a nested on
[13:01:22] <scar> gordian, hard to do a jsfiddle bc lots of css is involved
[13:01:27] <scar> i can show u the JS?
[13:01:42] <gordian> anything you can show rather than explain is helpful
[13:01:55] <gordian> but you can put css in jsfiddle.net you know
[13:02:20] <scar> gordian, http://jsfiddle.net/WtYqV/1/
[13:02:27] <scar> gordian, yes but the CSS is specific amonst parent elements, etc
[13:02:49] <scar> gordian, basically if the user were to move mouse in and out faster than the 700ms, and then move away, the box sort of goes in and out in and out until it stops
[13:03:00] <scar> i want to bsically prevent these onmouse over and on mouse out actions from stacking
[13:03:22] <gordian> i think stop() might help you
[13:03:29] <gordian> let me take a look
[13:03:36] <scar> hm
[13:03:44] <scar> let me try $(this).stop() before animate
[13:04:13] <scar> gordian, you sir are a correct ;)
[13:04:35] <gordian> great
[13:05:33] <marrow> having a problem with a .attr firing properly   $('img#icon').attr('src', 'img/loader.gif');
[13:05:35] <marrow> works from the console
[13:05:41] <marrow> doesn't work as part of a function
[13:06:05] <marrow> $("#connect").click(function (evt) {
[13:06:05] <marrow>   evt.preventDefault();
[13:06:05] <marrow>   $('img#icon').attr('src', 'img/loader.gif');
[13:06:06] <marrow>   window.location.replace("/auth/xyz");
[13:06:08] <marrow> });
[13:06:15] <marrow> but the redirect occurs
[13:06:18] <marrow> so i know the function is being called
[13:06:19] <marrow> any thoughts?
[13:06:41] <gordian> marrow: jsfiddle.net
[13:06:47] <gordian> that's my one and only thought
[13:06:55] <eugenmayer> :) new to fiddle :)
[13:07:38] <pachet> marrow: console.log($('#icon').length) to make sure its there
[13:08:13] <pachet> (you dont need 'img' in that selector, btw -- the id by itself should work)
[13:08:28] <andrewSC> hi all
[13:08:43] <marrow> its in there
[13:08:46] <marrow> length returns 1
[13:08:56] <marrow> are there any issues because its a .gif
[13:10:16] <marrow> if I manually edit the link in the console it works
[13:10:19] <marrow> and if I call jquery it works
[13:10:36] <marrow> the only thing I could see is that for some reason img/loader.gif isn't loaded when the jquery funciton calls
[13:11:57] <pachet> marrow: well, sure
[13:12:06] <pachet> when you set the .src, the browser loads the image
[13:12:11] <pachet> it may not display immediately :[
[13:12:17] <marrow> i get a red x :p
[13:12:29] <pachet> doesnt sound healthy
[13:12:31] <marrow> but i know the resource is at that url
[13:13:11] <marrow> i even know that the javascript call works
[13:13:13] <marrow> from the console
[13:13:47] <andrewSC> is there a way to only trigger a mouseover event on the actual contents of the div not the div itself?
[13:14:09] <andrewSC> for example i have 'foo' in a div that's 25% the width of the page
[13:14:18] <marrow> hmm its the window.location.replace
[13:14:22] <marrow> when i comment that out the image loads
[13:14:27] <marrow> which makes no sense to me because its after the fact
[13:14:31] <marrow> should i add in a .delay() call
[13:14:33] <marrow> ?
[13:14:38] <andrewSC> 'foo' isn't 25% the width of the page, the container is but I only want to trigger the event on a mouseover of the text
[13:15:11] <pachet> marrow: try an absolute path to the img
[13:16:13] <marrow> nope
[13:16:14] <marrow> not that
[13:16:20] <marrow> it has something to do with the window.location firing
[13:16:28] <marrow> which for some reason doesnt give it enough time to load the new image
[13:16:42] <ravenzz> ---
[13:16:47] <ravenzz> dude
[13:17:06] <ravenzz> it the location will be replaced immediately
[13:17:36] <ravenzz> what is the deal with changing the img src?
[13:18:21] <marrow> because the call to the api i am reaching takes a second
[13:18:27] <marrow> and i need to replace the img with a spinner
[13:18:34] <marrow> tried window.location =
[13:18:37] <marrow> and window.location.replace
[13:18:39] <marrow> neither works
[13:18:46] <marrow> despite that it gets called beforehand
[13:19:40] <ravenzz> tell me more about this api call
[13:19:55] <ravenzz> (paste the code somewhere)
[13:20:00] <marrow> well its a /auth/xyz handled by my express backend
[13:20:02] <marrow> that part works fine
[13:20:09] <marrow> in fact im testing it with two different apis
[13:20:10] <marrow> and i have the same issues
[13:20:14] <marrow> with the img
[13:21:25] <ravenzz> I don't understand, are you making an ajax request?
[13:21:46] <ravenzz> and when everything is done you want to replace() ?
[13:22:04] <marrow> no im just calling a jquery function on a click event
[13:22:18] <marrow> and at the end of the function is a window.location = 'url'
[13:22:21] <marrow> which hits a relative url in my app
[13:22:25] <marrow> which is handled by the express backend
[13:22:53] <ravenzz> ok as I said that will be executed immediately
[13:23:15] <ravenzz> and it will load a new page
[13:23:40] <ravenzz> so changing the img src right before that doesn't make sense
[13:23:42] <ravenzz> I guess
[13:26:55] <gordian> is there a good script to help me go back in time and murder the person who started using 'foo' and 'bar' as example text?
[13:27:13] <andrewSC> any input to the mouseover question i raised earlier?
[13:28:25] <andrewSC> because i'm not using sass/less I can't really do math to get the width of the contents of the div then set left and right margin percentages
[13:29:09] <andrewSC> it'd be a simple math problem of getting the width of the text, then getting that width - 25% and dividing that by 2 to get the left and right
[13:29:19] <andrewSC> but alas...
[13:31:34] <grafi> start using sass then :p
[13:44:33] <inv3nt0r> I know this isn't a Wordpress problem but perhaps someone here knows about this issue with the Nivo slider ---> http://chatop.athiel.ca/home/  The slides squish vertically between frames for no reason... effect is set to fade when I call it using jQuery...
[13:49:40] <kristofers> How do i go about calculating the sum of multiple dynamic rows
[13:54:02] <alainus> $(document).ready AND $(window).bind('resizeEnd', function() {  //.. function here }); <- What would be the proper syntax ?
[13:58:55] <Beam> anyway know a good jquery.mobile tutorial? the docs on jquerymobile.com isn't helping me very much at all
[13:59:47] <Beam> specifically regarding how the ajax works, it's doing stuff automatically that i don't want
[14:13:41] <veQue> anyone write greasemonkey scripts?
[14:18:58] <Matt`> so, $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel'); does nothing
[14:19:52] <grafi> veQue who doesnt :P
[14:20:08] <veQue> k
[14:20:35] <velts_> if you are iterating over any array [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h] and checking indexes is there get [a,e] [b,f] [c,g] [d,h]
[14:20:59] <veQue> i've had some success with setting it up (jquery that is) but does'nt work on youtube
[14:21:07] <usaaabb> hi everyone
[14:22:04] <veQue> gonna try just pasting the enitre jq contents it the script
[14:22:30] <grafi> how did you do it before?
[14:24:19] <diverdude> in google spreadsheet, anybody in here knows how to make sort() return indexes instead of values?
[14:25:42] <veQue> grafi: http://joanpiedra.com/jquery/greasemonkey/ think i tried this method
[14:26:02] <veQue> but i just pasted, that works
[14:26:10] <grafi> and that didnt wo
[14:26:13] <grafi> rk
[14:27:07] <veQue> well go figure
[14:27:12] <veQue> it works now
[14:27:19] <veQue> =p
[14:27:22] <grafi> good job
[14:27:40] <veQue> i always fix problems after i stare at them for an hour
[14:27:51] <veQue> and then ask for help
[14:28:00] <grafi> try fixing them after staring at them 3minutes
[14:28:09] <veQue> k
[14:28:10] <grafi> practice can make perfect
[14:28:13] <veQue> will do
[14:28:41] <veQue> well it works, guess i'll take some good with the bad
[14:48:44] <lsterling> Hi. I need help unwrapping multiple elements. Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TVdjJ/1/  -- I'm trying to split a list and wrap every 3 li's with a <div><ul> and then remove/unwrap the original <div><ul>. I'm almost there (i think) but I can only seem to unwrap one element and not both. I appreciate any help.
[14:52:23] <lsterling> Is anyone available to help?
[14:54:17] <scalex000> hello, Im trying to do a post but I cant to put a variable with all parameters, its possible?
[14:55:40] <scalex000> forget it
[15:01:41] <lsterling> Hi. I need help unwrapping multiple elements. Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TVdjJ/1/  -- I'm trying to split a list and wrap every 3 li's with a <div><ul> and then remove/unwrap the original <div><ul>. I'm almost there (i think) but I can only seem to unwrap one element and not both. I appreciate any help.
[15:01:44] <shoky> lsterling: why not just unwrap the children of .old-ul twice ?
[15:02:07] <shoky> why are you unwrapping inside the loop?
[15:02:20] <lsterling> That's what I want to do, but I don't know how to unwrap both.
[15:02:56] <lsterling> It's a wordpress gallery using bootstrap. I need to add a css style to each row. so I need to separate the <li> into groups of 3.
[15:03:23] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TVdjJ/4/
[15:04:16] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/TVdjJ/3/ damn shoky was first :P
[15:04:37] <shoky> ;p
[15:05:47] <lsterling> Thank you so much. That worked. Actually, for some reason I needed to do grafi's solution to get it to work on the live site, even tho both worked in the fiddle.
[15:05:50] <grafi> when seeing .unwrap().unwrap() or .parent().parent() I always think it would be great if you could just say .unwrap(2) or .parent(2)
[15:06:18] <lsterling> I didn't realize you could just do write unwrap twice. Still learning!
[15:10:50] <alainus> How can I do the red box respond to the hover effect even if mouse is passing through the green box?  --> http://jsfiddle.net/GEBgr/
[15:11:39] <grafi> but the green inside the red?
[15:11:43] <grafi> *put
[15:12:14] <alainus> grafi, worked :D thnks
[15:12:32] <grafi> np
[15:22:24] <quazimodo> is there any easy way to refresh bindings on a page after stuff is dynamically added?
[15:26:11] <orentanay> quazimodo: use .on
[15:26:44] <orentanay> it watches for dynamic additions and binds to them.
[15:28:22] * quazimodo hugs erichynds 
[15:28:25] <quazimodo> what
[15:28:34] * quazimodo disengages and goes after orentanay 
[15:29:03] <orentanay> you asked about binding to dynamically created elements earlier
[15:32:37] <quazimodo> yep
[15:32:45] <quazimodo> and i hugged you for giving me the answer
[15:32:45] <quazimodo> :)
[16:15:45] <JFranks> Hmmm I want an anchor added to http://jqueryui.com/ so I can link to the bottom of the page where the current version is listed?
[16:17:16] <JFranks> Like: http://jqueryui.com/#currentcdn  ?
[16:18:39] <tw2113> memorize the urls?
[16:18:42] <tw2113> :P
[16:18:47] <tw2113> put them in a sublime snippet
[16:21:05] <JFranks> It's for dumb people who don't get "Bottom of the Page" when I send them the URL :)
[16:22:14] <tw2113> they can learn to scroll imho
[16:23:17] <tw2113> or you could use #legal
[16:23:27] <tw2113> which will look odd, but it'll take you to the right spot
[16:23:31] <JFranks> Oooh keen eyes sir!! :)
[16:23:54] <tw2113> if they go "why 'legal'" tell them "don't ask questions, just click"
[16:24:33] <JFranks> It's hidden in an anchor text.. If they are smart enough to see the URL then they shouldn't be dumb enough to wonder. ;)
[16:24:45] <JFranks> (You'
[16:24:50] <JFranks> d hope..)
[16:34:41] <KWhat_Work> Is a widgets data instance set automatically?  Why is it described as "ui-progressbar" when I keep gettting uiProgressbar
[16:41:00] <KWhat_Work> hm cause firefox is a piece of shit
[16:42:36] <xiphiasx_> hi
[16:42:41] <xiphiasx_> so
[16:42:46] <xiphiasx_> in a webpage I have
[16:42:57] <xiphiasx_> i'm using localStorage to set a variable
[16:43:28] <xiphiasx_> i have to load that HTML page directly for the value to be displayed, if it is loaded by a button, it will not display
[16:45:47] <danheberden> xiphiasx_: what does "loaded by a button" even mean
[16:46:29] <xiphiasx_> the button being an <a href>
[16:47:30] <xiphiasx_> on any 3 pages (p[1-3]), there is an <a> that is clickable to go to another HTML file
[16:47:55] <xiphiasx_> a value should be rendered in that particular HTML when coming from one of those 3 pages
[16:48:07] <xiphiasx_> but that doesn't happen; i *have* to load the file directly for the value to display
[16:52:59] <danheberden> xiphiasx_: what do you mean "load the file directly" - are you leaving out a part of an href triggering an xhr to get page content and updating the page manually?
[16:55:28] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: no, i actually have to open the HTML file manually in my brother
[16:55:32] <xiphiasx_> ... browser
[16:56:14] <danheberden> xiphiasx_: so you aren't ever loading in this content via ajax and expecting it's localStorage to work, correct?
[16:56:33] <danheberden> you only want localStorage to work when clicking on the link and the browser redirects to that page, however you're still having problems with that?
[16:56:43] <xiphiasx_> yep
[16:56:49] <xiphiasx_> i could be very much wrong
[16:57:29] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: i can zip it up for you if you want
[16:58:49] <danheberden> xiphiasx_: if only i had a dollar for everytime i've heard that
[16:59:11] <xiphiasx_> i'm not surprised
[16:59:29] <xiphiasx_> in fact I could upload it
[17:03:16] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: http://xiphffff.net/Ambrosia/, go through the process, add some things and go to payment, you will see that it doesn't show any value, but when you refresh the page it does
[17:04:16] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: strangely enough, when you go to "start new order" once you've "paid", the entire thing breaks down
[17:06:08] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: also, this is a phonegap app.
[17:06:42] <vladikoff> xiphiasx_, you need to fix up your jquery mobile flo
[17:06:46] <vladikoff> flow*
[17:07:15] <clu3> Hello all, what good jquery plugin boiler plates would you recommend?
[17:07:15] <xiphiasx_> if only i knew exactly what was wrong
[17:07:36] <xiphiasx_> there are things i can fix, but once it goes back to index.html from payment.html and the whole thing breaks for no apparant reason
[17:07:42] <xiphiasx_> i become at a loss
[17:15:01] <vladikoff> xiphiasx_, one quick debug thing, make 'orderer' global, then use the console to check what's inside of the object at each stage of the flow
[17:15:47] <xiphiasx_> mkay
[17:19:28] <Guddu> Within the $(document).ready(function(){ can i refer to document as "this"?
[17:20:30] <anew> http://api.jquery.com/ what are they using here to send the ajax requests, but change the uri structure?
[17:20:49] <anew> normally if you send ajax and only change a div you have to keep the same url or use the hastags
[17:20:56] <anew> but how are they changing uri's ?
[17:21:02] <danheberden> anew, see ?g pushstate
[17:21:03] <bot-t> anew, Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[17:21:15] <xiphiasx_> vladikoff: it wouldn't explain why the CSS completely shits out when transitioning pages
[17:21:39] <anew> danheberden yeah but with pushstate dont u have to change uri's
[17:21:43] <danheberden> xiphiasx_: "loading pages" in jquerymobile actually gets the content via ajax
[17:21:45] <anew> sorry i mean keep the same uri
[17:21:51] <danheberden> so your css isn't loaded properly, i'd imagine
[17:22:02] <danheberden> nor is your new page's localStorage object initialized
[17:22:11] <danheberden> since it's, well, the current object
[17:23:02] <anew> danheberden
[17:23:20] <danheberden> anew, i don't know what you mean - i mean, api.jquery.com just loads new pages
[17:23:23] <xiphiasx_> danheberden: it's just your typical <link>
[17:23:36] <anew> danheberden no but you see how the header and side bar are persistent
[17:23:42] <danheberden> but, you can get content via ajax and update the location bar if you want
[17:23:48] <anew> they are persistent but the uri is changing /this/that
[17:23:54] <anew> etc
[17:23:56] <danheberden> anew, the header and side bar are persistent because it's present on both pages
[17:24:13] <anew> mmmm so it's not a single page app like i'm thinking
[17:24:15] <anew> (gmail)
[17:24:23] <danheberden> anew, no, but if you *wanted* to do that
[17:24:28] <coldhead> oh yeah those single page apps are great
[17:24:29] <danheberden> you would get the content via ajax
[17:24:30] <danheberden> update the page
[17:24:32] <coldhead> people love those
[17:24:36] <danheberden> and then use pushstate to update the location bar
[17:24:38] <anew> yeah if i wanted to do it i could use backbone
[17:24:39] <anew> yeah
[17:24:42] <danheberden> like github does, anew
[17:24:43] <anew> coldhead are you being sarcastic
[17:24:48] <danheberden> go to github.com/jquery/jquery
[17:24:52] <coldhead> i don't think so
[17:24:55] <danheberden> that's what i'm talking about - when you browse files there
[17:25:13] <anew> hmmm but they are changing uri's also
[17:25:18] <anew> how are they changing uri's ?
[17:25:26] <danheberden> xiphiasx_ http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/links/
[17:25:51] <xiphiasx_> ah
[17:28:16] <anew> danheberden
[17:28:20] <anew> http://caniuse.com/#search=pushstate
[17:28:21] <anew> not worth it
[17:28:38] <danheberden> anew, huh?
[17:28:49] <anew> pushstate browser support
[17:28:58] <danheberden> yeah, i hate when all modern browsers support something too
[17:29:06] <danheberden> also, you can fallback to hashbang
[17:29:07] <anew> wut
[17:29:20] <anew> u mean when all browsers dont support something
[17:29:34] <anew> unless you live in an internet explorer free world, over half my users on my sites use shitty versions of ie
[17:29:38] <anew> so it's not really practical
[17:29:49] <vladikoff> anew, pushstate is so awesome
[17:29:57] <anew> yeah i love it
[17:30:15] <anew> i wish i could take it to dinner, buy it some wine and make sweet love to it all night
[17:30:56] <anew> y u no pushstate
[17:30:56] <b-ot> anew: (屮'Д')屮
[17:31:12] <coldhead> gross
[17:32:59] <tds5016> hi. I keep getting this error when I try to use jquery mobile....
[17:33:00] <tds5016> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined
[17:33:06] <tds5016> on "line 2"
[17:33:12] <tds5016> I'm using version 1.3.0
[17:33:50] <tds5016> on minified, it's line 2.
[17:35:38] <tds5016> anyone able to help me out with that?
[17:38:14] <coldhead> abjorn!!
[17:40:35] <Gazpacho> what is it on the unminified version, give us a fighting chance here
[17:42:14] <coldhead> are you including the files in the right order? jQ first, then mobile?
[17:46:37] <csst0111> If you check this http://dmoysiadis.gr/news/  the schema is h2 - div - div  and again and again the same. When I run it here http://jsfiddle.net/37dAE/ works like I want it. Hides the 2nd div after the h2 Tag clicked.
[17:47:10] <csst0111> But if I run it from firebug console nothing works and I get : "No elements were found with the selector: "undefined""
[17:48:10] <anew> do you guys prefer .click() for submitting forms or .submit() ?
[17:49:03] <danheberden> anew: submit
[17:49:21] <danheberden> if i have to click the button instead of just pressing enter, boo
[17:49:27] <anew> so i click the button like normal and the id of the form triggers submit() right
[17:49:27] <anew> ah
[17:49:28] <anew> yeah
[17:49:46] <danheberden> the id doesn't do anything - it's just a property
[17:49:54] <danheberden> the form element dispatches a "submit" event
[17:50:06] <danheberden> where, in that handler, you can poke and prod it as much as you want
[17:50:10] <anew> i mean $('#id').submit();
[17:50:13] <anew> you are usingcorrect
[17:50:24] <danheberden> anew: also, $('#id').on(;
[17:50:27] <danheberden> oops
[17:50:34] <danheberden> $('#id').on('submit', function()..
[17:50:48] <anew> but did i write correct also ?
[17:50:55] <danheberden> anew, just the old way
[17:51:01] <danheberden> .on('eventname' is the recommended way
[17:51:06] <anew> old = bad ?
[17:51:08] <anew> hmm really
[17:51:08] <danheberden> because it's the same syntax for delegation
[17:51:35] <anew> and .on() will take care of enter and click
[17:51:39] <danheberden> e.g., $('.someContainer').on('click', 'a', function(){ /* every click event inside of .someContainer that is an 'a' element */ });
[17:51:45] <danheberden> anew: no, .on will bind your event
[17:51:54] <danheberden> binding to the submit event, however, will capture the form submission
[17:52:16] <danheberden> the form submission will capture the submit via a submit button (or the only button if there's only one) or enter in a text input
[17:52:16] <anew> mmm
[17:52:21] <anew> .submit() sounds easier
[17:52:36] <danheberden> anew .submit(function(){ is the same as .on('submit', function()
[17:52:38] <danheberden> you're overthinking it
[17:52:52] <anew> what was that 'a' you had in there ?
[17:53:12] <danheberden> anew, i was sharing with you an example of how .on(), as a method, is more superior if you get in the habbit of using it
[17:53:14] <danheberden> for ALL your events
[17:53:18] <danheberden> ?on
[17:53:19] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:53:21] <danheberden> you can read more there
[17:53:33] <danheberden> just trying to keep you in the loop on the new cool shit anew :)
[17:53:35] <anew> ya i'm on here
[17:53:42] <anew> just dont get the second parameter yet
[17:53:52] <danheberden> anew, you'll want to read up on event delgation
[17:53:56] <danheberden> it's not related to your current problem
[17:54:03] <danheberden> but, like, lets say you had a ul with 100 li items in it
[17:54:09] <danheberden> instead of attaching an event to EACH li
[17:54:13] <danheberden> you could just attach the event to the ul
[17:54:22] <danheberden> and let jQuery figure out what happened
[17:54:31] <anew> hmmm
[17:54:31] <anew> ok
[17:54:40] <danheberden> anyway, http://jqfundamentals.com has some stuff on it
[17:54:47] <danheberden> worth reading up on when you get some spare time
[17:55:08] <danheberden> also http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:55:11] <anew> oh oh
[17:55:11] <anew> i see
[17:55:15] <anew> i didnt read ur full sentence before
[17:55:19] <anew> too late for me
[17:55:20] <anew> 2am
[17:55:22] <anew> ok i get it now
[17:55:22] <anew> thanks
[17:55:27] <danheberden> :)

[18:07:18] <tds5016> hey. I'm trying to use jquery mobile... it looks like when I $().append() the range slider, it looks as if it won't actually get the jquery stuffs appended to it.
[18:07:21] <tds5016> what am I doing wrong?
[18:10:39] <tds5016> nevermind, figured it out.
[18:10:40] <tds5016> haha.
[18:10:58] <tds5016> next question... is there a nice way to add a custom tooltip to a slider? or make a slider fire off a custom event?
[18:15:20] <drterminal> no one talks here?
[18:15:29] <tw2113> it's friday night

[18:24:06] <tds5016> $("#slider").slider('option',{min: 0, max: 500}); this appears to not update the slider :-(
[18:24:16] <tds5016> can someone tell me what would possibly be going on there, am I doing that right?
[18:24:27] <tds5016> it keeps the current min and max at 0 and 100, not 500.
[18:25:22] <drterminal> tds5016: it is friday night. and as i just learned. people went outside for social life
[18:25:26] <drterminal> none here dude ^^
[18:25:51] <tds5016> heh, good call.
[18:31:13] <anew> u guys prefer json or jsonp
[18:34:00] <drterminal> it is friday. none here
[18:34:47] <anew> social life! who has time for that
[18:35:17] <drterminal> apparently someone has.
[18:36:54] <nocturne7> at work there's some guy that's trying to change the architecture of a single-page app so that modules do not get re-executed when switching between jquery UI tabs. I find this approach ridiculous. modules I want should be executed whenever I open the tab.
[18:38:22] <anew> kill him
[18:38:35] <drterminal> btw anyone knows about query here. http://dpaste.org/s2gqd/ in this code , 'status' returns false all the time. even my view sends true.
[18:38:43] <ner0x> What's the proper way to have a button click/toggle the checked status of a checkbox?
[18:40:23] <nocturne7> I really hate this DataTables plugin
[18:40:40] <nocturne7> it's such a crappy plugin
[18:43:32] <tw2113> drterminal, no need to be bitter about this
[18:43:46] <tw2113> they're all in the same boat as you, doing some coding, needing some help
[18:44:23] <drterminal> i know. i did not mean anything. just wanna let them know here is empty now.
[18:44:48] <tw2113> could be worse, i see 4 of you talking
[18:46:56] <drterminal> oki doki. sorry if i disturbed anyone.
[18:47:26] <tw2113> nope
[18:47:39] <tw2113> i'm disturbed, but in a completely unrelated way :D
[18:48:35] <drterminal> lol could be worse :)
[18:49:05] <drterminal> i am a little bit angry. trying to fix same that code for hours

[20:31:49] <samholmes> I need to get the computed style on an element
[20:31:52] <samholmes> does jquery have this?
[20:32:11] <samholmes> I want to be able to get the font-size when no font-size has been defined in the user-land
[20:45:09] <vladikoff> samholmes, http://api.jquery.com/css/#css1
[21:00:04] <blackxored> hello guys
[21:00:24] <coldhead> and girls
[21:00:52] <blackxored> ok, and girls ;)
[21:01:01] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[21:01:02] <blackxored> question
[21:01:46] <blackxored> i have this ui plugin i'm building with requirejs (for modularity since it's a looonng one, if the choice was wrong start by telling me why), and then I load it to my project with a local version of jquery
[21:01:46] <silv3r_m00n> I am putting ajax loaded content inside a div, now I want the div to animate to increase its height upto whatever height is required by the inner content , how to do this ?
[21:02:56] <blackxored> the problem is, that with chrome 25 which is what I'm using sometimes the plugin loads sometimes it doesn't and I get an undefined method error from the client code that uses it, the plugin at build stage is requirejs-stripped and almond used instead, and as I said the jquery version is the one from the project, any clues on this flickering behavior?
[21:05:55] <blackxored> does somebody actually understand what I just asked, because a second read found it not quite clear ;)
[21:10:05] <blackxored> ok let me rephrase (and yeah i know it's SO-like), i have a jquery ui widget factory plugin coded with requirejs modules, optimized at build time where requirejs is replaced by almond and jquery is stripped from the build in favor of the version in the page that the plugin will be used in (separate project), on runtime there are times where the code that calls the plugin fails with undefined method on $.fn.<plugin_name>, and sometimes it doesn't
[21:15:52] <blackxored> anyone?
[21:27:31] <samholmes> Is there a way to get a ready event handler to fire after the dom is ready even when the event handler is binded after the dom ready?
[21:28:20] <samholmes> Like, if I bind a callback to domready event after the dom is already ready, then it wouldn't fire.
[21:28:54] <samholmes> cause it's already ready and no domready will fire.
[21:29:07] <samholmes> the callback wouldn't be triggered
[21:29:19] <samholmes> How do I do fix this?
[21:40:35] <abjorn> coldhead: !!
[21:40:41] <abjorn> yeah, I know, I'm several hours late
[22:01:10] <coldhead> abjorn: congratulations
[22:09:34] <abjorn> coldhead: danka
[22:10:47] <SockMonkey> Is there a better way to grab the third element on a page other than $('ul')[2] ? I can't seem to use that with something like .wrap
[22:17:38] <SockMonkey> And now I've just discovered :eq() which may help
[22:18:28] <wookiehangover> SockMonkey: yes, there's also .eq()
[22:18:42] <wookiehangover> but that's the way to get something by its index
[22:19:45] <SockMonkey> Unfortunatly the thing I want to affect has no id or class
[22:19:58] <SockMonkey> But that seems to have made it .wrap friendly
[22:20:27] <uhoh54> hey all.  looks like the themeroller for jqueryUI webpage is acting up.  currently--no matter which theme used or which browser used--the "Error" field (usually under the "Highlight" field) is missing.  also, the dropdown menu for Weight under Font Settings is blanked out.  Normally it let's you choose reuglar  and bold.
[22:21:55] * SockMonkey is a jquery newbie and pretty much the same for javascript, learning by coding
[22:22:04] <SockMonkey> I'll ahve to try out that try.jquery.com out too at some point
[22:22:18] <uhoh54> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller
[22:22:43] <SockMonkey> Ooo
[22:23:41] <SockMonkey> Thanks for the link
[22:24:32] <uhoh54> i think they broke some options on the themroller, though.  or...?
[22:25:12] <SockMonkey> Ah well I definitely wouldn't know
[22:28:13] <uhoh54> yeah, either there is something funky with my browser cache (which I can't clear ATM), or they broke parts of the themroller when they went from 1.10.1 to 1.10.2 recently.
[22:28:55] <shoky> uhoh54 the error field is there.. the font weight dropdown is broken tho yea
[22:29:46] <shoky> oh you mean in the menu under highlight, nevermind
[22:33:25] <uhoh54> glad it's not just me
[22:36:08] <uhoh54> although i'm still not seeing the Error field anywhere.  i even tried in IE, a browser i've never used themeroller with so it isn't a cache problem.
[22:36:55] <shoky> i'd thought you meant the example error alert on the right side
[22:36:57] <shoky> for some reason
[22:37:12] <shoky> i dont see any error field on the themeroller itself either
[22:37:28] <uhoh54> ah
[22:37:42] <uhoh54> should i report this?
[22:38:13] <shoky> shrugs
[22:38:13] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:38:55] * uhoh54 shrugs
[22:38:55] <b-ot> uhoh54: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:38:56] <SockMonkey> I see a Hey! and Alert: box on there
[22:39:05] <SockMonkey> nothing more under the Highlight / Error area
[22:39:47] <shoky> yea, he meant no error field on the left side themeroller component
[22:39:53] <SockMonkey> ah
[22:41:12] <SockMonkey> Huh yeah, Firebug isn't showing it's existence between Highlight and Overlay
[22:41:51] <SockMonkey> It doesn't exist anymore
[22:42:09] <SockMonkey> lol cept I wouldn't know that it even did exist. Odd anyways
[23:00:49] <aixenv> hi im trying to write a script/program to import csv data and then display it in a sortable table, ive written a script that's semi close, but im not able to figure out how to only display specific headers and not make it display all my headers, anyone able to assist?
[23:01:00] <aixenv> here's the script in question - http://pastebin.com/ACwTVdWk
[23:01:34] <aixenv> any help is appreciated
[23:01:38] <tref> I just got done reading this http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ from addy osmani
[23:01:56] <tref> what's the most popular design pattern these days? I'm seeing a lot about the revealing module pattern
[23:07:10] <Whirl3d> if given a list of elements in a variable, lst. Is it better to get the "active" class element within it by using lst.filter(".active"); or lst.find(".active"); ?
[23:09:28] <coldhead> find and filter do different things, babe
[23:10:15] <Whirl3d> drats. I vaguely understand the difference, but wouldn't each of those statements work to select an ".active" element with lst? Thanks for the reply.
[23:10:33] <Whirl3d> *within
[23:13:10] <coldhead> .find() would search the children of lst
[23:13:25] <coldhead> which might not necessarily be members of lst
[23:13:49] <coldhead> .filter just searches whatever is in lst already
[23:13:52] <coldhead> and not children
[23:13:59] <coldhead> thank you for your question
[23:17:26] <Whirl3d> Weird. So find doesn't work because I want to search the list of elements and lst has no children? only peers?
[23:17:57] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/cLx57/
[23:18:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/cLx57/1/
[23:18:55] <Whirl3d> Great to know. Thanks for the clarification.
[23:28:06] <Whirl3d> How do I get the index of an element within a jquery collection if the collection is a subset of a bigger list? In other words, if I have last 10 elements of a 100 element list selected. How do I determine what the index number (out of 10) a certain element is?
[23:31:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/cLx57/2/
[23:31:59] <Whirl3d> got it. I have never used lst.index(item) before. So simple.
[23:39:27] <Whirl3d> Why can't jsfiddle figure out when it has entered an endless loop and stop itself? Why aren't there built-in protections to ensure that you don't lock it up? It's so frustrating...
[23:50:43] <Gazpacho> whirl3d: because the halting problem is undecidable silly
[23:51:09] <systemfault> Of course!
[23:52:07] <erisco> it seems that if I write something like    $(something).replaceWith(ele); ele.height();   that ele.height() results in "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'height' of undefined " on line 7051 in  jquery v1.9.0
[23:53:51] <Gazpacho> what kind of thing is ele
[23:54:03] <Gazpacho> or what should it be
[23:56:22] <Gazpacho> are you possibly referring to a local variable in one place and then an attribute of the window object in the other?
[23:57:11] <erisco> I figured out what the issue seemed to be. ele was constructed as   $("<div/>").html(string).contents()  because 'string' contained multiple nodes (no root)
[23:57:20] <erisco> then calculating the height caused an error
[23:58:01] <erisco> probably still not good that it is an error as such
[23:58:56] <Whirl3d> Gazpacho, I would be willing to cope with the tiny delay in my jsfiddle if every second it interupted whatever loop was happening and checked to see if the "C" key was held down or something. If it was, cancel the loop and stop the program. Heck every 5 seconds even.
[23:59:12] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, btw.
[23:59:57] <Whirl3d> Chrome used to do it...it would say, "it appears that a script has become unresponsive...." but not any more-or at least not with jsfiddle.
