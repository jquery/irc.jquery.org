[00:37:19] <Justus> hi, I am trying to use the :contains() selector on iPhone OS 7.1, but it fails to select an element that I can see on the screen. I haven't been able to find any known bugs with iOs and until now I thought that the selectors were supposed to be completely above any compatibility issues, any ideas what might be behind this?

[02:08:00] <Plux> Hi everyone, I'm working on a web-application and I use jQuery UI with tabs and accordions and qTip2 (with tooltips).
[02:08:01] <Plux> I'm trying to create a "help" function that would toggle the display of all visible tooltips - and when the user change tab or accordion, then the tooltips should update based on which tooltips that should be visible.
[02:08:06] <Plux> I've created a simple js-fiddle example that illustrates the problem pretty well: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3My2/2/0

[03:43:15] <jacksmith> Can somebody tell me a faster alternative to dataTables since it take 30secs to load 343KB of JSON content which is too slow ??
[03:44:36] <Plux> datatables use 15 seconds to load 50mb here
[03:44:51] <Plux> you sure you are not doing anything wrong?
[03:45:12] <Plux> owh, I should mention, in i.e. it takes forever (are you using ie?)
[03:45:55] <ivh> I run an .ajax() request that gives be an XML document. How do I apply an xsl stylesheet to it before pushing it into the DOM?
[03:48:41] <jacksmith> This is my code if you could help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/5LFY7/
[03:48:52] <jacksmith> in tracing what could be making it slow
[03:51:20] <systemfault> What is datatables?
[03:51:50] <systemfault> (A jQuery plugin obviouslyâ€¦) But which one is it? Does documentation exists for it?
[03:56:31] <jacksmith> @Plux This is my code if you could help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/5LFY7/ it would be great.

[05:08:21] <Macaveli> Is it possible to timeout a ajax post?
[05:09:04] <systemfault> Look at the doc.
[05:19:01] <b4bass> Hi, Id like to prevent click events on a modal windows while wainting for an AJAX response. Ive created a stackoverflow topic but no one seems to be able to answer. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24427151/prevent-click-before-ajax-response thanks
[05:44:05] <Plux> Guys, I could use some help with how to hide tooltips when combining jQuery UI and qTip2: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3My2/6/
[05:51:04] <silverdust> is it ok to have a semi-colon at the of JS if-statements like if(){};  ?
[05:55:08] <Amnesia> question, how would I be able to post an iterable?
[06:01:14] <Macaveli> Please notice my comment in https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/b5effbc2122c7fe1cdc5 is it possible to do something like that?
[06:01:41] <Macaveli> ^ I want to add a timeout to the ajax post
[06:09:20] <shoky> Macaveli:  $.ajax has a timeout option
[06:09:41] <Macaveli> shoky, both codes should fire at the same time
[06:09:52] <Macaveli> I want a back up if something goes wrong with the ajax call
[06:10:15] <Macaveli> or I want to timeout ajax after 60 seconds for example
[06:10:15] <shoky> ok.. there's a timeout option
[06:10:22] <shoky> you can use it.
[06:10:49] <Macaveli>  timeout: 10000,
[06:10:52] <Macaveli> indeed thanks
[06:10:55] <shoky> if the timeout expires before the response arrives, it'll trigger the error handler
[06:11:00] <shoky> with a "timeout" error
[06:20:29] <quetzakubica> Guys I have this code for uploading files
[06:20:33] <quetzakubica> via ajax
[06:20:33] <quetzakubica> http://pastebin.com/rDPJUbws
[06:20:44] <quetzakubica> but in request there is no content of file

[06:37:13] <Ice_Strike> Is something wrong with this? $("#account[]:checked").val();
[06:37:21] <Ice_Strike> I have a list of checkboxes with array ID
[06:38:07] <Ice_Strike> eg: <input type="checkbox" id="account[]" value="gos"/>e
[06:39:37] <bradbrad> KevinM Sorry man didn't realize there was a reply! Tried it but no luck, still only works on the first filter, not when you filter by artist or anything else http://new.eclecticaartandantiques.co.za/
[06:44:35] <Frazzz> hi
[06:44:55] <Frazzz> does anyone here us jquery transit?
[06:51:19] <shoky> Ice_Strike: there's no such thing as an array ID. ID's must be unique.  also to select by ID that has special chars you need to escape them  $("#account\\[\\]:checked")
[06:55:19] <beasty> pondering if there is a way to get all event bindings on a element
[06:55:50] <MikeD_> does the "request" object passed to autocomplete's option.source function have a default toString() rendering that is the .term property value?
[07:00:24] <Frazzz> can anyone see whats going wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/2aSPn/
[07:00:56] <Frazzz> the object in the first log is fine, but after the transition is ran, duration and easing is gone and scale becomes an array like ["scale", 2, 2]
[07:03:27] <Daghdha> Hi, i am getting this in my debugger: Exception was thrown at line 1139, column 6 in http://localhost:57963/Scripts/jquery-2.0.3.js
[07:03:52] <MikeD_> i miss having line numbers in exceptions
[07:04:16] <Daghdha> It gets caught though, should i worry about it?
[07:04:25] <Daghdha> Or is it just something built into jquery that's ok
[07:04:42] <systemfault> jQuery itself doesnâ€™t throw for fun.
[07:04:52] <systemfault> Your code has issues that makes jquery throw.
[07:06:23] <Daghdha> jquery catches it, and returns an object though.
[07:09:16] <shoky> Daghdha: if jquery catches it then there's nothing to worry about
[07:16:34] <Daghdha> Well it's jquery code so i am not sure what i am doing wrong. The selector it uses there is .fi:eq(127)
[07:16:39] <silverdust> why do people write jQuery variables like $foo . What diff does it make from just foo ?
[07:16:57] <decx> it's just for convenience
[07:17:03] <BillCriswell> silverdust: I do it to keep in mind it's a jQuery object.
[07:17:07] <Daghdha> doesn't $ denote objects in js?
[07:17:19] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: No.
[07:18:06] <MikeD_> "I like money though"
[07:18:16] <antlong_> how do you pass the id of the element that you clicked, for use in jquery-contextmenu?
[07:18:39] <decx> this.id
[07:18:51] <silverdust> So you dont's use the $ when storing strings in variables ?
[07:19:20] <MikeD_> antlong_:  no offense, but that question suggests you may be missing some understanding of how those functions work
[07:19:33] <Daghdha> It bombs here but i am just using a selector, i am not sure what i am doing wrong. push.apply( results, newContext.querySelectorAll( newSelector ));  i tried adding Array.prototype but still same error.
[07:20:11] <antlong_> MikeD_ none taken
[07:20:57] <frank_o> Hello! Say I have a variable containing a class, how do I later append another class to it?
[07:21:00] <frank_o> Tried `var myClasses = $('.a'); myClasses += $('.b');` as well as `var myClasses = $('.a'); myClasses.add('.b');` but nothing.
[07:21:00] <silverdust> BillCriswell: ^
[07:21:43] <BillCriswell> silverdust: I do not.
[07:21:47] <decx> myClasses.add('.b') doesnt change myClasses, it generates a new object
[07:21:58] <silverdust> Thanks
[07:22:01] <frank_o> decx: Oh I see
[07:22:07] <decx> eg var all = a.add(b)
[07:22:37] <BillCriswell> "Junior Dev: thinks they know everything; Regular Dev: thinks they know nothing; Senior Dev: hates computers"
[07:22:41] <frank_o> Cool thanks!
[07:22:47] <BillCriswell> I almost peed myself reading that for some reason.
[07:22:54] <frank_o> I shoulda known smh
[07:23:04] <frank_o> BillCriswell: hahaha
[07:23:54] <Frazzz> any idea on my fiddle further up?
[07:23:55] <BillCriswell> Happy to find myself in the "Regular Dev" group.
[07:24:14] <decx> when do you stop hating computers and start hating people
[07:24:39] <BillCriswell> decx: I imagine that happens between regular and senior? I'm getting to be about there.
[07:25:07] <decx> did you print out your work excuse already?
[07:25:20] <BillCriswell> What's that?
[07:25:25] <decx> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BrAmejCCcAAXf4q.png
[07:26:28] <BillCriswell> I'm such a bad American. I had no idea.
[07:26:51] <decx> well now is the time to act as if you care
[07:27:11] <frank_o> decx: Sorry, bit confused, what method should I use then?
[07:27:13] <silverdust> I used .fadeOut() and .html() to switch pages. The problem is when one page is long and I've scrolled to about half my screen display area, navigating to the next page leaves the scroller at its position. Is there a way I can scroll to top after switching pages?
[07:27:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Will there be parades and drinking if we win? That's when I get involved.
[07:27:45] <Daghdha> Please see following jquery lib code, it's the Sizzle() method. It keeps throwing at line 93. Am i doing soemthing wrong or should i just ignore it?  http://pastebin.com/rZJHgdSa
[07:27:50] <BillCriswell> silverdust: Yes, just do $(window).scrollTop(0);
[07:27:51] <frank_o> Tried `var myClasses = $('.a'); myClasses.append('.b');` but I guess it don't work that way
[07:27:52] <decx> there's going to be a smug storm ravaging the countra
[07:27:54] <decx> y
[07:28:04] <silverdust> Thanks BillCriswell
[07:28:32] <decx> i just told you frank_o
[07:28:41] <decx> var c = a.add(b)
[07:28:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Ick.
[07:28:57] <BillCriswell> decx: Hopefully we're too busy video taping people being beat up in public and junkies on public transportation to notice.
[07:28:58] <frank_o> decx: I have no choice but to create a new variable?
[07:29:22] <decx> i guess you could do a = a.add(b)
[07:29:28] <motaka2> Xliff|NGNL:
[07:29:37] <BillCriswell> I think I'm finally kicking this cold's ass.
[07:30:17] <frank_o> ah yes ofcourse!
[07:30:26] <motaka2> hello what does this sentence means? specify requirement to conform to common usability standards, such as IBMâ€™s CUA standards Microsoftâ€™s GUI standards]
[07:30:29] <frank_o> Many Thanks and God Bless !!
[07:32:46] <decx> motaka2 they are asking you if there is a need to conform to something specific
[07:33:30] <motaka2> decx: It's a part of SRS doc my prof is asking me. But my native lang is not english so I dont understand it
[07:33:37] <decx> in natural language that would be: "hey guys, do we have to follow guidelines or can we just wing it"
[07:33:42] <decx> well then i dont get it
[07:33:44] <decx> :>
[07:34:15] <decx> i'm not a native speaker either, neither in english nor middlemanagement speak ^^
[07:34:20] <motaka2> decx: I got you
[07:34:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you hear someone bet money that that dude would bite someone and won like $74,000?
[07:34:41] <motaka2> decx: But seems you understand it better than me
[07:34:50] <motaka2> I hate requierment engineering
[07:35:01] <decx> BillCriswell suarez just got banned for 4 months for it as well
[07:35:09] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice.
[07:35:16] <Daghdha> more like 7000 kroner
[07:35:19] <decx> he bit 3 people in 3 years i dont get how the odds were so good

[07:35:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh, I knew nothing of his history haha.
[07:36:08] <decx> special needs football savant
[07:37:07] <Daghdha> Apparently it was entrapment, Chielini put pasta sauce on his shoulder,
[07:37:46] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: haha
[07:38:06] <decx> he agrees with BillCriswell crackers ARE delicious
[07:38:33] <frank_o> Anyone know why it's impossible to click the `Open panel` button in jQuery Mobile when my custom SVG touch indicator is enabled (using Chrome's mobile emulation)? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/M5q34/embedded/result/
[07:39:02] <Daghdha> I do wonder though, the damage you can do with a little bite likethat is minimal. It pales in comparioson to elbows and bone crunching stretched leg tackles.
[07:39:33] <decx> sure but then you ask yourself: who the hell bites people?
[07:39:45] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: He didn't Tyson him or anything.
[07:40:41] <MikeD_> I want FIFA to leave this to player justice, like hockey.  He'll stop biting when the opposing team administers legal beat-down for doing it.
[07:41:40] <BillCriswell> I'd love boxing if I didn't fear ending up border line retarded at the end of my career.
[07:41:47] <decx> now i'm hungry, i'm going to get some italian for dinner as well
[07:41:56] <frank_o> BillCriswell: yeah :)
[07:42:06] <lab_> hi everyone
[07:42:07] <BillCriswell> Sausage, onions and peppers sound really good right now.
[07:42:18] <MikeD_> "get some italian" ?  oh that's not a reference to cannabalism
[07:42:42] <lab_> first timer so please accept my apologies for misuses
[07:42:45] <BillCriswell> How do MMA fighters end up? Are they as bad as some boxers?
[07:42:59] <lab_> i would like some help..
[07:43:04] <BillCriswell> lab_: This is a no judgement zone.
[07:43:14] <BillCriswell> It's like the Planet Fitness of code... just with less purple.
[07:43:33] <beasty> how do i remove a custom event from a group of elements ?
[07:43:37] <lab_> I'm trying to extend a selectable but i doesn't work
[07:43:48] <BillCriswell> beasty: .off('click.foo')
[07:43:48] <beasty> i'm trying it like this
[07:43:50] <beasty> $('#formbody').off('fieldhook', 'input,select');
[07:44:01] <beasty> but it keeps attached to the element
[07:44:33] <BillCriswell> beasty: How are you putting the events on the element?
[07:44:55] <lab_>   $.widget("custom.listmultiple", $.ui.selectable, { selecting : function(e, ui){ 	console.log("selecting");   } });
[07:45:37] <beasty> BillCriswell: $('#' + block).on('fieldhook', '#' + field.name, function () {
[07:45:59] <lab_> any idea why extend this way doesn't works :
[07:46:00] <lab_>   $.widget("custom.listmultiple", $.ui.selectable, { selecting : function(e, ui){ 	console.log("selecting");   } });
[07:46:03] <Bakoo> hi guys. Is they a way to tell jQuery when I click on this word "Pop up contact form" STOP <div class"row"> from rendering
[07:46:05] <lab_> ?
[07:46:46] <lab_> the offical demo shows an example with superDialog
[07:47:02] <Bakoo> basically i have a about 20 forms which uses the class "rows"
[07:47:07] <lab_> exntending it and changing the method open works fine
[07:47:17] <Bakoo> but i am creating 3 new forms and i dont want it to use it.
[07:47:27] <lab_> but the same with a ui.selectable is not working
[07:47:43] <Bakoo> i have another jquery running which apply the row class to those 20 other forms
[07:47:51] <lab_> Is this a known issue ?
[07:48:44] <Bakoo> lab- are u talking to me?
[07:48:45] <uskerine> $('#fooTable tbody').on( 'focusout', 'input.discountText', function () {            alert(   XXXX      );      });
[07:48:57] <uskerine> what should I put instead of XXXX to get the inner text of that input?
[07:49:13] <lab_> well sort off...
[07:49:25] <lab_> I'm a noob there and I try to get attention
[07:49:43] <lab_> don't how how to ask for help here...;-)
[07:50:17] <BillCriswell> uskerine: this.value would give you it.
[07:50:26] <lab_> Bakou ?
[07:50:43] <BillCriswell> lab_: Not too familiar with extending that. You could probably get more help if you set up a little demo on jsfiddle or something.
[07:51:00] <uskerine> thanks
[07:52:15] <lab_> BillCriswell : I could. I refer to the following official doc http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/
[07:52:51] <lab_> BillCriswell :  I tried the example provided : $.widget( "custom.superDialog", $.ui.dialog, {     open: function() {         console.log( "open" );     } });   // Create a new <div>, and convert it into a superDialog. $( "<div>" ).superDialog();
[07:53:08] <lab_> It works well with a dialog, not with a selectable
[07:54:01] <uskerine> easiest way to force an input element to have either a number or a %?  (-100.23     +22   +23,43   -5% etc.)

[07:57:32] <sumperson> https://dpaste.de/sCip
[07:59:31] <MikeD_> you don't need error handling if you write perfect code  :p
[08:00:17] <hooloovoo> MikeD_: Someone else who's api you're using might have. :)
[08:00:26] <MikeD_> sorry, i missed that part about other's code... yeah, playing well with others is a pain.
[08:01:58] <sumperson> MikeD, im trying to create a code to be embedded on other sites
[08:02:39] <MikeD_> like a marketing partner analytics and spying tool?

[08:04:56] <iSDP> it's for a campsite reservation system...
[08:05:17] <iSDP> what's the easiest way to do this, i don't want to make a dirty old html image map..
[08:05:36] <thebope> iSDP, what do you mean highlight? Draw a box around?
[08:05:41] <thebope> Trace the image edges?
[08:05:55] <iSDP> http://www.barkhoorn.nl/xlntcms/user/plattegrond_de_barkhoorn_2014.jpg
[08:05:59] <iSDP> campsite spots
[08:06:58] <sumperson> use line ??
[08:07:12] <thebope> I'm not exactly sure, I know you can do some great things with HTML5 and CSS3 these days
[08:07:47] <basile_s> Hello All, I'm Basile Starynkevitch.
[08:08:02] <thebope> 'Ello Basil good chap
[08:08:04] <basile_s> Is it possible to append several HTML elements?
[08:08:16] <thebope> sure why not
[08:08:44] <iSDP> thebope, how about using two images, one to hilight the spot you've chosen with a drop down menu, another to show which places are taken already
[08:08:54] <basile_s> e.g. $('#someid').append("<span class='sp_cl'>foo</span><input id='newinp' type='text'/>") ?
[08:09:05] <thebope> basile_s, yea that should be okay
[08:09:10] <thebope> I've done similar before
[08:09:18] <basile_s> It seems that this does not work.
[08:09:38] <thebope> in what way?
[08:09:54] <thebope> iSDP, That could work, it might be tough
[08:10:03] <thebope> you might want to just be able to click the image to select a site
[08:10:18] <basile_s> Have to figure out. It looks like after that append $('#newinp') is still undefined.
[08:11:48] <Bakoo> what does $( "p" ).removeClass( "myClass yourClass" ) what does $("p") do? does it look for the the word P or the p paragraph html element?
[08:11:49] <thebope> can you put your code into a jsfiddle?
[08:12:00] <sumperson> that's for all paragraph tags
[08:12:05] <thebope> yea what sumperson said
[08:12:13] <Bakoo> sumperson thats
[08:12:17] <Bakoo> sumperson thanks
[08:14:25] <basile_s> With the firefox 30 debugger, how can I get the DOM element of some given id in the debugger?
[08:19:39] <Bakoo> sumperson what I am trying to do is on click function which makes jquery remove <div class="row">
[08:19:41] * beasty pokes Cork 
[08:19:50] <Bakoo> please can u help
[08:20:11] <beasty> $('.row).remove(); ?
[08:20:35] <decx> depends if you want to create a relation from the clicked element to an appropriate .row element
[08:20:48] <decx> or juts all of them (if so then what beasty wrote)
[08:21:15] <Bakoo> beasty Thanks :D God bless
[08:24:21] <Bakoo> beasty one more question. is they another way to say when i click on the close button which has a class called "close" put back <div class="row">
[08:32:43] <beasty> Bakoo: $('body').on('click', '.close-btn', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).prev('.row').remove(); });
[08:32:47] <beasty> or somthing like that :p
[08:34:45] <Bakoo> $( "#quickform" ).click(function() {          $( ".row" ).remove();             });   $('body').on('click', '.close', function(e) {        e.preventDefault(); $(this).prev('.row').remove();    });
[08:35:09] <Bakoo> beasty it doesn't replace .row back :(
[08:35:58] <NoiseEee> then perhaps you want to .hide() it instead of .remove() it Bakoo
[08:36:23] <Bakoo> NoiseEee good point
[08:36:31] <Bakoo> hide and uphide
[08:38:07] <Bakoo> that works now hide and show. Thanks NoiseEee for the idea and thanks beasty for bearing with me
[08:38:35] <checkit> Hey jQuery pros. I need some advise. My application allows visitors to record there voice as part of a song. Then they fill out a small form to submit. I'm having trouble combining the recorded song with the form data to post via AJAX. Can anyone peek at my JS and tell me how I should be doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/BTD67/
[08:39:40] <iSDP> hey peeps, i can't find anything about this, but i want to show which site has been chosen, and which sites are unavailable on a map... what's the best approach? http://www.barkhoorn.nl/xlntcms/user/plattegrond_de_barkhoorn_2014.jpg
[08:40:00] <Bakoo> last question guys
[08:41:20] <Bakoo> I have manage to hide and show it now. Now I have just one issue. They is one row class i need not to hide. I want to hide the <div class="row"> which is below the <button class="close">
[08:42:02] <Bakoo> is that possible?
[09:14:35] <antlong_> would calling addClass with the name of the corresponding css animation start the effect?
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> it can, yes.
[09:19:02] <duch_kazatel> iirc there's a quirk about browser rendering if you're doing it on pageload.
[09:20:21] <nicechap2no> I am using jquery file download plugin to download a file from server to the users machine
[09:20:22] <nicechap2no> http://johnculviner.com/jquery-file-download-plugin-for-ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads/
[09:20:37] <nicechap2no> does anyone know how to show the progress while the file is being downloaded ?
[09:21:18] <duch_kazatel> check this out - http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[09:25:06] <jorvis> Does anyone know of a control like a list that is paginated and lets users use their down arrow to scroll through them?
[09:28:53] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a select box?
[09:29:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Unat2/1/
[09:29:35] <duch_kazatel> these aren't paginated by default.
[09:29:45] <duch_kazatel> but you might be able to munge them.
[09:35:03] <duch_kazatel> I just want to point out that the comments on the mootools docs pages are driven by Disqus.  Which uses jQuery.
[09:35:12] <IceBerg1> http://pastebin.com/J3sJvpc7    the form action page just returns 'success!' but the content is not being written to the div. This is the copied example from:  http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ with only the form action changed. I'm new to JQuery so I don't understand why the content isn't getting written.
[09:35:37] <MikeD_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Unat2/2/
[09:35:44] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:36:38] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg1 and you're not getting an error?
[09:36:50] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ okay?
[09:37:55] <MikeD_> idk, just added the optgroup to the example for the "pagination" idea
[09:38:12] <MikeD_> i'm guessing that's not what was meant by "like a list"
[09:38:35] <duch_kazatel> i think the dude is looking for something a little more featureful maybe.
[09:38:56] <duch_kazatel> if you get into a case like that, you don't want a paginated list.  you want a search.
[09:39:18] <MikeD_> right
[09:40:34] <IceBerg1> duch_kazatel: no
[09:41:12] <MikeD_> IceBerg1: then maybe you should make a fiddle to better explain
[09:41:56] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg1 and if you put a console log in that .done() is works?
[09:41:57] <duch_kazatel> *it
[09:42:47] <IceBerg1> duch_kazatel: forgive my ignorance, but what is the format for that?
[09:42:59] <duch_kazatel> console.log('some text here');
[09:43:07] <duch_kazatel> then open up your javascript console.
[09:43:24] <duch_kazatel> see if you get the text you put in there after running your code.
[09:44:45] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with the js console?
[09:47:58] <IceBerg1> ok, yea I get the output in console just fine, no errors
[09:48:33] <IceBerg1> this is the EXACT output returned from the form action  <pre>success!</pre>
[09:49:52] <duch_kazatel> console.log(data) in your .done()
[09:49:54] <duch_kazatel> see what that is.
[09:51:44] <IceBerg1> ok, so that contains the results from the post, it looks fine.
[09:51:48] <duch_kazatel> if the return is literally just what you pasted here, then your var content = $( data ).find( "#content" ); doesn't make sense.
[09:52:56] <duch_kazatel> in fact, you could just do $( "#result" ).html(data); and forgo everything else.
[09:52:58] <IceBerg1> like I said I copied this example from the jquery docs.  Does it need to be a complete html page? I just tossed something togethet to output real quick
[09:53:06] <duch_kazatel> no, it does not.
[09:53:13] <IceBerg1> let me try that
[09:54:07] <duch_kazatel> because $( data ).find( "#content" ); is looking for something with the ID of content inside of the returned data.
[09:54:46] <IceBerg1> Bingo that worked.  The example I was using wasnt clear on what it was doing so I was just trying to replicate it.
[09:55:24] <duch_kazatel> the example assumed you understand basic traversal :)
[09:58:10] <IceBerg1> duch_kazatel: I need to actually learn JQ, but I needed something to grab the post dynamically so I was playing with the example.  Recommendations on a good book?  There seem to be too many to just pcik at random.
[10:00:07] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com
[10:00:45] <Forbidd3n> Is there a way to find a node with an attribute greater than a number?
[10:00:53] <IceBerg1> thanks, I appreciate your patience
[10:01:36] <duch_away> i'm off to a funeral.  i'll be back later.  enjoy folks.
[10:01:39] <Forbidd3n> for example if an attribute is menu-top="20", menu-top="30", menu-top="40" and I check it with 25 I want to return the element with menu-top="30"
[10:04:22] <sacho_> use a filter function
[10:04:23] <shoky> Forbidd3n: assuming they all have class "someclass":  $('.someclass').filter(function() { return parseInt($(this).attr('menu-top'), 10) > 25 })
[10:05:48] <antlong_> shit
[10:06:09] <shoky> is that so
[10:06:16] <antlong_> so, im adding a class based on the outcome of a random choice, it's correct to expect the animation to begin automatically, right?
[10:06:28] <antlong_> the class contains the animation, btw.
[10:07:14] <shoky> if you're talking about css transitions.. yes, generally
[10:07:30] <shoky> donno what the random choice has to do with anything
[10:08:06] <antlong_> the random choice has the class i am applying
[10:08:21] <shoky> irrelevant. you're adding a class.
[10:08:27] <shoky> (or you're not ;p )
[10:08:30] <antlong_> ... what
[10:09:04] <shoky> when you add a class, the css transition should show, yes, if you did it right.
[10:09:43] <antlong_> there's 2 objects, copy and class, because depending on what copy i return, i need to show a specific animation
[10:09:55] <antlong_> is that alright or did i implement something crazy
[10:10:02] <shoky> no idea what you're talking about
[10:10:46] <uskerine> if "this" is an input element named="foo" and contained into a datatables row <td>, how could I reference another input item named "superFoo" in the same row <td>?
[10:10:59] <antlong_> jeez...
[10:11:09] <uskerine> (so i can alter the second one when focusout the first)
[10:11:32] <antlong_> shoky https://dpaste.de/ZL8L
[10:13:08] <shoky> antlong_: doesn't look crazy to me
[10:13:12] <antlong_> ok cool
[10:13:15] <antlong_> this is all brand new to me
[10:13:33] <antlong_> is there a way to run the animation on demand?
[10:14:54] <shoky> again, if you're talking about css transition... it should be applied as soon as you add the class
[10:15:01] <shoky> assuming you did it right.
[10:15:23] <antlong_> it starts automatically when i run addClass("foo") in console, but not in the code.
[10:15:44] <shoky> then you probably have a bug
[10:28:00] <antlong_> would .animate work with a css class?
[10:28:41] <BillCriswell> antlong_: No. If you have jQuery UI there you can use .toggleClass() and it'll animate between the two, though.
[10:29:04] <antlong_> any difference between toggleClass and switchClass?
[10:30:11] <BillCriswell> Never heard of switchClass... it appears they do the same thing.
[10:30:21] <BillCriswell> I might have misinformed you about toggleClass(), let me check haha
[10:30:36] <antlong_> :) i just happened to have the switchclass docs page up when you mentioned it
[10:31:06] <BillCriswell> It appears they both do the same thing.
[10:31:49] <BillCriswell> Seems like toggleClass is a little more complex.
[10:31:55] <BillCriswell> Too lazy to follow the differences now haha.
[10:31:59] <antlong_> yeah, that's what i was thinking too
[10:32:24] <antlong_> i think switch automatically animates
[10:32:27] <antlong_> toggle does not
[10:39:41] <Forbidd3n> shoky: thanks for the help. I am trying to figure out a way to highlight the correct nav item when scrolling if they reach a specific point, then add class active to nav item
[10:40:45] <lebster> when i call $('nav')[0].remove(); i get the following error in IE -  Object doesn't support property or method 'remove'. what am i doing wrong?
[10:40:48] <Forbidd3n> what you gave me works, the issue is it selects all nav items higher than the scrollTop
[10:41:05] <Forbidd3n> so it works, just want the first item selected not all of them
[10:42:53] <lebster> sorry there was a typo, i am calling $('.nav')[0].remove();
[10:43:07] <eax> Hi there - jQuery UI - Sortable - Can I get the list I drop the item in somehow?
[10:45:22] <eax> Nevermind! The answer is "stop" :)
[10:53:33] <lebster> i did $('.nav:first').remove(); and that worked... i wonder why you cant do $('nav')[0].remove();
[10:56:59] <Forbidd3n> shoky: any way to use what you gave me an only apply it to the first element versus all of them?
[11:20:54] <NoiseEee> Forbidd3n: check out first()
[11:21:09] <Forbidd3n> NoiseEee: found it, thanks
[11:28:04] <sledgeDJ> hey guys 4.0. broke my spdif audio. anyone know about this?
[11:28:09] <sledgeDJ> 4.0.6
[11:28:14] <NoiseEee> what 4.0?
[11:28:48] <BillCriswell> jQuery 4.0.6 is like... 72831798379812 years old.
[11:29:05] <sledgeDJ> oops wrong channel
[11:29:11] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: i think you mean -72831798379812
[11:29:30] <BillCriswell> Exactly.
[11:29:47] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: :)
[11:32:53] <antlong_> i'm having a lot of problems with this animation stuff. essentially there's an image, that has 2 possible classes. the first class's animation should always be applied, then some code runs, and i need to stop the animation, apply the new class and ideally have the new animation begin.
[11:33:09] <baskwalla> Hello everyone
[11:35:57] <antlong_> $(this).addClass('abc',1000); can that 1000 be interrupted?
[11:36:32] <ChocoPants> sup peoplessss
[11:36:40] <BillCriswell> antlong_: Add one class, then when the animation is complete add the other class.
[11:37:07] <antlong_> BillCriswell the original animation runs 1s, it needs to be stopped so i can switch to the next animation
[11:37:29] <antlong_> so animation_1 is 1 second, code runs, and a couple of milliseconds later decides if we need a class change
[11:38:03] <BillCriswell> antlong_: Hard time following you.
[11:38:44] <BillCriswell> antlong_: Do you want to pause an animation half way, add another animation and have them both complete at the same time?
[11:39:37] <antlong_> BillCriswell while the main animation is running, i check the return of a function and then need to either let the animation continue until the second is up, or stop the animation and change to another
[11:40:15] <felixjet> if i use html5 required attribute like <input type="text" required />
[11:40:20] <felixjet> how i do select it with jquery?
[11:40:25] <felixjet> using the required attr as selector
[11:40:39] <NoiseEee> felixjet: $('input[required]')
[11:41:06] <NoiseEee> antlong_: pretttttty sure you don't get to do anything during actual animation.
[11:41:24] <felixjet> >.< thanks xD
[11:41:32] <antlong_> NoiseEee javascript is still running, afaics
[11:41:55] <NoiseEee> antlong_: sure it is, but JS is single threaded.
[11:42:22] <BillCriswell> antlong_: I think you'd need to use .animate() to accomplish that? There's a step() method for that.
[11:42:56] <NoiseEee> ahh that makes sense
[11:43:37] <antlong_> BillCriswell what i have right now, is two classes with the animations. the main class, and the secondary. if the condition is met, the secondary should interrupt the main animation and switch it.
[11:43:40] <BillCriswell> If you're using CSS animations I think you can just add the class whenever you want and it should play nice? I am not positive though.
[11:44:13] <antlong_> afaics that wouldn't work for me, because the initial animation is longer than it would take to change the animation
[11:44:40] <NoiseEee> antlong_: well to achieve that 'check something happening during the animation' i think what BillCriswell described is what you want. animate() with the step function
[11:44:58] <NoiseEee> antlong_:  otherwise you're basically a slave to http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/
[11:45:13] <BillCriswell> antlong_: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#step
[11:45:14] <antlong_> but does animate() accept a css class, or would i need to rewrite my css classes (which i don't think i can actually do)
[11:48:38] <decx> i thought you add classes?
[11:48:52] <decx> the animation of a new class already stops a running animation
[11:55:04] <BillCriswell> antlong_: http://jsbin.com/hofelowe/1/ something like this kind of?
[12:00:01] <staticshock> is there a concise way to generate a chunk of html like this: "<span>some-text</span> some-other-text"? both chunks of text are parameters, and i need to html escape both, and generate the resulting html chunk as text.
[12:01:15] <staticshock> $('<span/>').html(someText) gets me everything except the second literal, but html-encoding a literal via jquery seems like kind of a hassle
[12:03:07] <silverdust> I have been using $(document).on('event','.class'); to pick even elements that are not ready on page load. I'm using a plugin with a function like $('.class').pluginFunction() and it doesn't affect the contents that were included with javascript
[12:08:54] <staticshock> never mind, underscore might be a better fit for this
[12:09:13] <staticshock> with _.template('<%- ... %>', ...)
[12:23:45] <NoiseEee> silverdust: you'd have to instantiate the plugin each time.
[12:23:50] <|PiP|> if i make an ajax call to a server, and the server does a redirect, will the ajax call throw an exception?
[12:24:02] <hlvwrk> hey cuties
[12:24:12] <hlvwrk> how do you prevent typing greater than key in an input?
[12:24:17] <hlvwrk> o.o
[12:24:22] <hlvwrk> (so shift + .)
[12:24:38] <hlvwrk> but allow .
[12:24:40] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:25:10] <silverdust> NoiseEee: how's that?
[12:25:42] <silverdust> instatiate the plugin like drop a <script> tag in the template HTML
[12:25:54] <silverdust> to instantiate it at the point of load ?
[12:26:19] <NoiseEee> just call $('.someClass').pluginFunction() when the new elements appear
[12:26:29] <hlvwrk> hey yo, NoiseEee <3
[12:27:18] <antlong_> removeClass doesn't include callbacks?
[12:27:36] <silverdust> NoiseEee: inside the <script> I guess? I'm sorry I really don't grasp where to do that if not in the script
[12:27:51] <gnarf> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2014/06/jquery-ui-1-11-0/
[12:28:02] <gnarf> ^^^ 1.11.0 is out!
[12:28:11] <antlong_> awesome
[12:28:12] <hlvwrk> how exciting
[12:28:52] <NoiseEee> silverdust: somewhere in the script after the new elements appear
[12:29:25] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: you can look into http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/ or basically google "capture keyboard input javascript"
[12:29:44] <hlvwrk> so 190?
[12:29:59] <hlvwrk> shift + 190?
[12:30:33] <hlvwrk> ;/
[12:32:24] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: what are you asking me
[12:33:39] <Rob__> Hi people
[12:34:29] <Rob__> Im having some trouble with jquery ui sortable; I have set a handler for sortable elements, but now all child handlers with the same class act as a handler.. Could anyone tell me how i could disable that?
[12:35:10] <hlvwrk> NoiseEee:  idk
[12:45:50] <hlvwrk> how do you prevent typing greater than key in an input? (shift+.)
[12:45:55] <hlvwrk> halp?
[12:47:29] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220196/how-to-decode-character-pressed-from-jquerys-keydowns-event-handler @ hlvwrk
[12:51:55] <|PiP|> if my server does a redirect on an ajax request, IE11 uses the error callback. Is that normal behaviour?
[12:54:52] <hlvwrk> so why doesnt this work?
[12:54:52] <hlvwrk> if ((event.shiftKey) && (event.keyCode < 190)) { event.preventDefault(); };
[12:54:54] <hlvwrk> why
[12:54:55] <hlvwrk> :(
[12:56:51] <erming> hlvwrk what kind of event are you listening to?
[12:57:02] <hlvwrk> keydown
[12:57:05] <erming> some events does not emit e.keyCode
[12:57:13] <erming> hmm.. keydown should, though
[12:57:23] <hlvwrk> it seems to ignore
[12:57:50] <hlvwrk> i'm trying to prevent typing the '>' key, so allow period, but dissallow >
[12:57:53] <hlvwrk> so shift + .
[12:57:55] <hlvwrk> (190)
[12:58:07] <erming> if you split these if statements up into two parts
[12:58:30] <erming> if (event.shiftKey) { alert("SHIFT"); } and then if (event.keyCode < 190) { alert("KEY"); }
[12:58:43] <erming> well, you know, brute forcing the problem :>
[12:59:54] <hlvwrk> works
[13:00:03] <hlvwrk> but i need to detect shift + .
[13:13:34] <BillCriswell> Blag.
[13:16:16] <hlvwrk> sooooo
[13:16:17] <hlvwrk> if (e.shiftKey && key == 190) { event.preventDefault(); };
[13:16:21] <hlvwrk> why you no work
[13:17:02] <systemfault> hlvwrk: What even are you handling anyway?
[13:17:05] <systemfault> *event
[13:17:18] <hlvwrk> keydown
[13:17:27] <systemfault> Also, donâ€™t expect a lot of help here if you donâ€™t have a jsfiddle example.
[13:22:49] <NoiseEee> or use that library i linked to and be done with it
[13:25:33] <Amnesia> question, is it correct that it's impossible to set a cookie on localhost using firefox's web console?
[13:25:36] <Amnesia> (I'm not talking 'bout the developer toolbar)
[13:25:48] <Amnesia> I can confirm that that actually does support rw access to firefox's local cookies
[13:32:55] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: http://jsfiddle.net/zp9ZX/
[13:33:08] <Amnesia> ah fcup nvm, pebcak, sorry for the spam
[13:33:28] <hlvwrk> simple_combo!?
[13:34:08] <hlvwrk> o.O
[13:35:22] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: using the library i mentioned, its linked to.
[13:35:35] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/
[13:35:47] <hlvwrk> there isn't a non library method in doing this?
[13:35:58] <NoiseEee> sure there is
[13:37:54] <hlvwrk> >;
[14:14:47] <uskerine> Anybody who has used validate JQuery plugin ->  Is there anything wrong in this definition? http://pastebin.com/pm4TUDja
[14:34:21] <skinux> Will someone help me as to why this json request is failing? http://pastebin.com/jFcub9ip
[14:42:54] <uskerine> what would you use if you want to mask <input> so they accept currency amounts (something like 101.22€, 99000€, etc.)?
[14:59:11] <onethfour> i have an <a> inside a <td>, how do I clone the current <tr> and append it below
[15:01:20] <jphase> onethfour: is the event you're on referencing the anchor tag?
[15:03:21] <jphase> like are you on $('a.somelink').on('click', function() {  // for example? });
[15:15:54] <uskerine> I am trying to assign a validation to an <input> element, but the <input> is generated dynamically once page is loaded. How could I make this happen? $('#newInvoiceTable input.discountText').autoNumeric('init', { .....      (the input.discountText are generated later)
[15:16:35] <JesperA> look in the docs for .on
[15:18:32] <aleray> hi, how to prevent the click event to be propagated after I resize an jquery ui resizable element?
[15:20:18] <jphase> aleray: is e.stopPropagation(); not workin' after resize or something?
[15:23:28] <aleray> jphase, I tried to put it in the stop and resize cb but it doesn't work
[15:23:56] <Velveeta> aleray: if it's a click event that's propatating, you'd have to put it in the click handler, not stop or resize
[15:24:12] <jphase> damn you Velveeta, always faster with your data entry skills
[15:24:18] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[15:24:22] <aleray> Velveeta, just tried this too
[15:24:27] <jphase> like, right when I get to my punctuation hehe
[15:24:29] <Velveeta> i sit on the sidelines until somebody else has the answer, then i swoop in for the kill
[15:24:35] <jphase> lol
[15:24:42] <aleray> does not seem to work, but let me again
[15:24:50] <Velveeta> aleray: can you put together a jsfiddle demo or something that we can look into?
[15:24:53] <aleray> (just because it makes sense)
[15:28:28] <uskerine> JesperA, as ".autoNumeric('init'..." is being used, can .on work in this case? I only see standard JS events in the doc
[15:32:04] <Velveeta> i may have to repurpose some of autoNumeric's code for something i've wanted in my own widget library :)
[15:32:51] <aleray> Velveeta, hard to make a minimal exemple, it is a quite long backbone view... Shall I copy the main parts?
[15:32:58] <aleray> in a pastebin
[15:33:26] <Velveeta> aleray: if it's a resize issue in general, you should be able to make a simple example that demonstrates the issue, with any content container that's instantiated as a resizable widget
[15:33:44] <Velveeta> we don't need to see it in the context of your application necessarily, if it's something inherent in the widget behavior itself
[15:34:05] <Velveeta> if it's not something inherent in the widget behavior, then it has to be something in some of your own code that's causing it to happen
[15:34:40] <aleray> Velveeta, ok
[15:34:59] <Velveeta> in the meantime, i'm reading through the ui.resizable src
[15:38:52] <aleray> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/n9wwq/1/
[15:39:07] <aleray> it does not trigger th eclick event on body if you go slowly
[15:39:35] <Velveeta> so, if i drag anywhere, it doesn't trigger a click.. only if i do an in-place click
[15:39:37] <aleray> if you go fast and your mouse goes outsied the handle, it does trigger the click on body
[15:39:51] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:40:13] <Velveeta> i still can't produce that behavior... what browser are you seeing this in?
[15:40:36] <aleray> Velveeta, chromium 35
[15:40:53] <Velveeta> hmm, in chrome i'm not seeing that behavior
[15:41:30] <aleray> so if my pointer happens to be outside the drag handle on release I see "body clicked"
[15:42:05] <Velveeta> oh yeah, now i got it to happen
[15:42:23] <aleray> aha!
[15:42:37] <aleray> that subtle
[15:42:49] <aleray> *that is
[15:43:19] <Velveeta> so, i have it dumping the event info also, and the e.target property is showing body....
[15:43:31] <Velveeta> that being said, i don't know that you *can* disable the click event in this case...
[15:43:57] <Velveeta> wait a minute, let me try something else
[15:44:25] <aleray> thanks
[15:44:42] <Velveeta> yeah, if i switch your event binding to be a delegated event for #foo instead, i can't recreate that behavior
[15:44:57] <Velveeta> it seems to be detecting this click as an actual click on the body, so i don't know that there's anything you can do to squelch that
[15:58:53] <aleray> Velveeta, ok for some reason I have a tiny offset when I start resizing my eleement, which make my mouse cursor slightly offset and on the body. I will try to fix this first
[15:59:48] <jParkton> when I need to get the string inside the div how do I select it? var a = $('#myid').innerHTML;
[16:03:47] <uskerine> how can i refer an <input name="foo"> which is in the same <tr> element than the current 'this'?   <tr>  <td><input name="1"></td>   <td><input name="foo"></td>   </tr>
[16:05:14] <Velveeta> jparkton: if you just want the string, you can do either $('#myid').text() or $('#myid')[0].innerHTML
[16:05:34] <Velveeta> the text() function will strip all tags and give you just the textual content of the innerHTML, if there are nested child tags
[16:05:55] <Velveeta> uskerine: is 'this' the td, or the tr?
[16:06:02] <uskerine> this is the input
[16:06:21] <uskerine> so i am processing an event that affects to <input name="1"> and i  would like to update <input name="foo">
[16:06:25] <Velveeta> then you can just reference this
[16:06:26] <uskerine> of the same <tr>
[16:06:50] <uskerine> no, but I mean something different
[16:06:57] <uskerine> this refers to <input name="1">
[16:07:08] <Velveeta> then you can do $(this).closest('tr').find('input[name="foo"]')
[16:07:12] <uskerine> and I would like something that would refer <input name="foo">
[16:07:17] <uskerine> ok
[16:07:18] <uskerine> thanks!
[16:07:21] <uskerine> that's what I was looking for
[16:07:25] <Velveeta> no problemo
[16:07:35] <uskerine> hasta la vista baby
[16:11:49] <uskerine> $(this).closest('tr').find('input[name="discount"]').val(  parseFloat(discountTextValue).toFixed(2).toString()   );
[16:12:18] <uskerine> can JS and JQuery be mixed in this way? either parseFloat is not correctly used or it can't be used inside val()
[16:12:54] <tw2113> jquery is js
[16:12:56] <tw2113> so yes
[16:13:03] <Jattenalle> you dont need the toString, but yeah that should work just fine
[16:14:06] <uskerine> so despite netbeans says "the global variable  parseFloat is not defined", that's correct?
[16:14:41] <Jattenalle> uskerine, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[16:14:42] <Jattenalle> ya
[16:15:45] <uskerine> ok thanks
[16:18:11] <Velveeta> yeah, netbeans is just unaware that parseFloat is a library function apparently
[16:18:18] <Velveeta> it's just throwing up a preemptive warning
[16:18:44] <Jattenalle> and that's why you notepad++
[16:18:45] <Jattenalle> :3
[16:19:35] <uskerine> I like notepad++, but I also have server-side java stuff
[16:19:52] <uskerine> so netbeans makes that much easier
[16:30:06] <jParkton> Velveeta: thank you!
[17:01:52] <wa5ted> Velveeta: yo
[17:01:55] <wa5ted> grafi: yo
[17:02:00] <aleray> Velveeta, this is my bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8932
[17:02:04] <Velveeta> yo ho ho and a bottle of irish whiskey
[17:02:40] <jParkton> I just made this with Ember, I know its really nubly but im proud I made something? :) http://jparkton.github.io/
[17:02:52] <jParkton> also some jQuery so valid!
[17:02:56] <jParkton> lol
[17:03:08] <Velveeta> aleray: gotcha.. yeah, looks like a fix is still in the works
[17:04:48] <KevinM> bradbrad: sorry, ever solve your problem?
[17:05:18] <rina> jParkton: its a great site but it needs some css loving
[17:05:33] <rina> and some simplistic ui design :)
[17:05:49] <jParkton> fo sho
[17:06:04] <jParkton> like what would you suggest?
[17:06:19] <rina> you can find free to use psds for portfolio websites and use those :)
[17:06:21] <wa5ted> Velveeta: missed yo ass. been a long time
[17:06:25] <rina> let me see what I can find for you
[17:06:26] <wa5ted> since ive paid attention here

[17:06:55] <wa5ted> jParkton: go through portfolio templates on themeforest
[17:06:59] <wa5ted> and just browse them
[17:06:59] <rina> like the whole badges section is really off
[17:07:02] <wa5ted> and come up with something
[17:07:02] <jParkton> k
[17:07:10] <rina> its a tiny container compared to the rest of the site
[17:07:10] <wa5ted> this is what my site looks like

[17:08:09] <jParkton> maybe remove that whole coderbits widgit thingy?
[17:08:12] <wa5ted> the dudes at ##design a huge help, you want someone to critique design they are the best
[17:08:30] <rina> my portfolio site is killer
[17:08:31] <wa5ted> flame , visua, kiy and a few others are pros
[17:08:37] <rina> I had a designer friend design it for me

[17:11:10] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: they wont
[17:11:13] <wa5ted> just be private
[17:11:13] <jParkton> LOL
[17:11:18] <wa5ted> and discrete
[17:11:48] <wa5ted> jParkton: prep hard and make sure its perfect, they will tear it apart other wise. BTW i dont mind working with you one on one if you want
[17:11:59] <wa5ted> i like to see good design XD
[17:13:09] <jParkton> sure
[17:13:18] <jParkton> Im blind so design is tough for me lol
[17:13:29] <rina> this steak im eating
[17:13:38] <rina> is amazing
[17:13:43] <wa5ted> bro
[17:13:49] <duch_kazatel> i had a steak sando for lunch. so good.
[17:13:51] <wa5ted> try tomato, cheddar cheese and bacon panini
[17:13:54] <wa5ted> that is art
[17:14:02] <rina> broo
[17:14:06] <rina> I cooked this steak
[17:14:13] <rina> and im having a beer too
[17:14:50] <duch_kazatel> what's the beer?
[17:14:51] <wa5ted> yeah and i made the panini
[17:14:54] <wa5ted> yeah
[17:14:56] <wa5ted> that is more important
[17:16:32] <davidadams> what is jquery looking for in an OPTIONS request in order to send the "real" request?
[17:16:42] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:17:13] <systemfault> davidadams: To see if the transaction is possible.
[17:17:52] <davidadams> systemfault: but is it keying of a 2XX response code? specific headers? a combo?
[17:18:02] <davidadams> off a*
[17:18:24] <systemfault> davidadams: 200 + CORS headers
[17:18:36] <jParkton> $.get(url, callback)
[17:18:41] <systemfault> davidadams: Of course, that OPTIONS call is only done if CORS is needed
[17:18:53] <davidadams> systemfault: right. thanks
[17:23:36] <Velveeta> i smelled the word beer.. did somebody say beer?
[17:24:43] <duch_kazatel> beer
[17:24:44] <wa5ted> yes
[17:24:47] <wa5ted> beer
[17:24:52] <wa5ted> the bear drank the beer though
[17:24:56] <wa5ted> and this is what happened
[17:25:25] <wa5ted> http://youtu.be/O6Xo21L0ybE?t=3s
[17:25:26] <jParkton> mmm
[17:25:40] <rina> mill street organic
[17:25:41] <rina> :)
[17:25:46] <rina> beer
[17:26:37] <Velveeta> i have a hard enough time doing organic anything.. i certainly wouldn't trust any beer with an organic label...
[17:27:06] <duch_kazatel> sierra nevada's estate ales are organic.
[17:27:34] <Velveeta> i don't drink sierra nevada either
[17:27:36] <Velveeta> :D
[17:27:40] <duch_kazatel> what why
[17:27:43] <duch_kazatel> you go away forever.
[17:28:05] <Velveeta> i've only had a couple of their brews, and they were meh
[17:28:24] <Velveeta> their pale ale and their celebration ale
[17:28:28] <duch_kazatel> ah that's why.
[17:28:41] <duch_kazatel> i will agree that they were a little lackluster for a while because they were having such a hard time keeping up with demand.
[17:29:01] <Velveeta> careful, you're coming awfully close to a no true scotsman fallacy ;)
[17:29:08] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:29:20] <duch_kazatel> i live in the same town as SV, so i'm partial to the,m.
[17:29:36] <Velveeta> gotcha
[17:30:01] <Velveeta> i live right down the road (relatively) from shiner texas.. but their beer's still just ok for the most part
[17:30:16] <Velveeta> their black lager isn't too bad actually
[17:30:27] <duch_kazatel> we get shiner here.  it's decent stuff.
[17:30:43] <Velveeta> it's certainly not *bad*
[17:31:01] <Velveeta> it'll kick the crap out of bud/miller/coors* anyday
[17:31:17] <Velveeta> i try not to even let my eyes fall on one of those beers
[17:32:59] <Velveeta> my personal favorites are probably newcastle/stella artois/roscoe's hop house amber/breckenridge vanilla porter.... and just about any ocktoberfest i can get my hands on.. especially warsteriner.. fuckin scrumptious :)
[17:33:05] <Velveeta> warsteiner*
[17:38:35] <duch_kazatel> i've had warsteiner in berlin.
[17:39:12] <duch_kazatel> it was okay.  much preferred pilsener urquell in prague.
[18:25:42] <Velveeta> i still haven't tried pilsner urquell yet, but have come close to buying some on several occasions at the store..
[18:26:12] <Velveeta> and i've had regular warsteiner brews a couple of times in the past, and they were ok, but i love their ocktoberfest brew specifically :)
[18:37:25] <hugo_moss> how can i use an ajax request with jquery to create a jquery object as the response, and then use jquery to manipulate the jquery object with functions like .html()
[18:42:38] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: var $response = $(response);
[18:42:40] <hugo_moss> my question is how can i return the ajax response with the content as a jquery object
[18:42:49] <hugo_moss> thats it?
[18:42:54] <hugo_moss> thanks
[18:43:01] <BillCriswell> Should be... I think.
[18:43:08] <BillCriswell> Try it out and see.
[18:51:18] <hugo_moss> hmm it didnt work
[18:51:25] <hugo_moss> in the success callback
[18:51:36] <hugo_moss> success: function( response){
[18:51:55] <hugo_moss> var $response= $(response);
[18:52:17] <hugo_moss> says uncaught object
[18:53:38] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: Do you have a demo?
[18:53:48] <hugo_moss> oh probably because it has an html doctype
[18:53:52] <hugo_moss> and script tag
[18:53:53] <hugo_moss> and all that
[18:54:00] <hugo_moss> i think ive had this error before
[18:56:11] <hugo_moss> i didnt use the html type
[18:56:15] <hugo_moss> in the ajax request
[18:56:39] <hugo_moss> or it has to be json
[18:58:21] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: Doesn't sound right.
[18:58:32] <BillCriswell> Do you have a demo somewhere?
[18:59:15] <hugo_moss> $.parseHTML( response )
[18:59:17] <hugo_moss> works
[18:59:26] <hugo_moss> i had this error before
[18:59:33] <hugo_moss> always forget
[18:59:38] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[19:00:29] <hugo_moss> $( $.parseHTML( response ) );
[19:05:38] <hugo_moss> it worked sweet
[19:06:11] <hugo_moss> i had a magento html page that i was loading into a bootstrap modal dialog
[19:06:58] <hugo_moss> originally, i had changed the page to strip out its container, and when going to the page, it showed just the content of what i wanted in the modal dialog
[19:07:06] <hugo_moss> which worked fine for the bootstrap modal
[19:07:11] <hugo_moss> but if i went to the actual page
[19:07:16] <hugo_moss> the container was removed
[19:07:22] <hugo_moss> so it didnt look right
[19:07:55] <hugo_moss> so instead of loading the modal with the stripped container with .load, i just stripped out the container of an ajax request
[19:08:06] <hugo_moss> instead of stripping the container of the actual page
[19:08:38] <hugo_moss> now the modal and the page look exactly the same
[19:12:27] <hugo_moss> why i had done it that way in the first place i dunno
[19:56:01] <acidjazz> i want to asynchronousely load a json file .. and use its data.. but can i avoid AJAX?
[19:56:03] <acidjazz> like can i do something like <script type="text/javascript", src ="/cfg/config.json" />
[19:57:23] <acidjazz> hah.. itd have to assign the json to something
[19:57:25] <acidjazz> raw json isnt valid js
[19:58:25] <RaptorJesus> HOW
[19:58:29] <RaptorJesus> do I make a readable timestamp?
[19:58:32] <RaptorJesus> plz?
[19:58:55] <RaptorJesus> plzhalp
[20:02:22] <Velveeta> define "readable timestamp"
[20:02:32] <Velveeta> typically it's either readable, or a timestamp...
[20:03:22] <Velveeta> acidjazz: and the quick answer to your question is that no, you can't load raw json with a script tag, but if you have valid js that contains your json as a variable assignment, then sure, you could do that
[20:03:45] <Velveeta> although if you do it with an embedded script tag at the time the document is loading, that's not asynchronously loading it..
[20:06:32] <jphase> speaking of readable and timestamps, momentjs' new styles are lookin' purdy
[20:07:14] <Velveeta> styles?
[20:08:40] <jphase> they made their website look better
[20:08:54] <jphase> well.... used color and such
[20:08:55] <Velveeta> ahhhhh yes
[20:08:55] <chrisTech2> How do I select multiple elements but each or one of the selectors is using a jquery function? eg. $(this).siblings('.dial').toggle(function() {}); If I want to add another selection to toggle, I tried $(this).siblings('.dial').parent().next('.sometext').toggle(function() {}); Here I'm trying to add the next parent but doing this deselected class dial. What am I doing wrong?
[20:10:11] <Velveeta> christech2: each time you add a new dom-querying function to the change, you're changing the context of the current collection scope.. even when you add to a collection, you're causing a change of collection scope which you can back out of with the .end() function..
[20:10:24] <Velveeta> there's no easy-inline way to do what you're trying to do
[20:10:40] <Velveeta> you'd have to cache off one collection, and add to it with a separate query
[20:11:20] <Velveeta> if you wanted to do it all inline, it would be something messy like this: $(this).siblings('.dial').add($(this).parent().next('.sometext')).toggle(function() {})
[20:11:58] <chrisTech2> Cool, let me try that. Is this the right way to do it though?
[20:12:11] <Velveeta> well, it's *a* way to do it, but not one i would advocate
[20:12:36] <Velveeta> i'd take your function expression there, and break it out into a standalone function declaration, or a variable function expression, and pass it to 2 separate collections, like this:
[20:13:01] <chrisTech2> If this works, I'm going to have to run with this, time is against this project I'm working on. Thanks! testing now...
[20:13:10] <Velveeta> var foo = function() {}; $(this).siblings('.dial').toggle(foo); $(this).parent().next('.sometext').toggle(foo);
[20:14:19] <Velveeta> or var collection = $(this).siblings('.dial'); collection = collection.add($(this).parent().next('.sometext')); collection.toggle(function() {});
[20:17:01] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, awesome!
[20:19:29] <RaptorJesus> ok gaiz
[20:19:42] <RaptorJesus> var d = new Date();
[20:19:42] <RaptorJesus> 		var formattedTime = (d.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + d.getDate() + '/' + d.getFullYear() + ' ' + d.getHours() + ':' + d.getMinutes() + ':' + d.getSeconds();
[20:19:43] <RaptorJesus> that works
[20:19:46] <RaptorJesus> but is ugly
[20:19:57] <RaptorJesus> is there a jquery way
[20:20:59] <RaptorJesus> or better way in general
[20:28:22] <acidjazz> Velveeta: right i didnt mean the html literally.. the async party
[20:29:27] <Velveeta> raptorjesus: look at momentjs, it makes date-formatting a snap
[20:29:43] <Velveeta> acidjazz: gotcha.. is there a reason you don't want to or can't load that json via ajax?
[20:34:10] <acidjazz> why wont this work in any version of IE: JSON.parse({"test": "ing"});
[20:35:02] <acidjazz> Velveeta: because its a config file w/ scripts to load
[20:35:38] <RaptorJesus> srsly
[20:35:50] <RaptorJesus> i can't believe there's no easy way to format times in js
[20:35:59] <acidjazz> RaptorJesus: use moment
[20:36:03] <acidjazz> otherwise welcome to hell
[20:36:10] <Velveeta> right
[20:36:26] <Velveeta> acidjazz: JSON.parse is expecting a string to parse, you're trying to feed it an object literal
[20:36:33] <RaptorJesus> I don't want to include a whole other file just for one line
[20:36:35] <Velveeta> try this: JSON.parse('{"test": "ing"}');
[20:36:53] <Velveeta> raptorjesus: then you don't want a non-ugly way to do it
[20:37:09] <RaptorJesus> i already am including jquery
[20:37:17] <Velveeta> simplicity of interface requires complexity of code libraries
[20:37:22] <RaptorJesus> i demand easy time formatting in basic jquery
[20:37:28] <Velveeta> jquery isn't the be-all-end-all of javascript
[20:37:36] <RaptorJesus> i don't care
[20:37:42] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, I also want to add to toggle the next element after sometext but doesn't seem to work. What I did: $(this).siblings('.dial').add($(this).parent().next('.sometext, .somemoretext')).toggle(function() {});
[20:37:44] <RaptorJesus> js should have easy time formating
[20:37:54] <RaptorJesus> what human can read time in seconds?
[20:38:06] <Velveeta> js should also have thread pools, what's your point?
[20:38:23] <RaptorJesus> bitching makes shit happen sometimes my friend
[20:38:43] <Velveeta> christech2: are .sometext and .somemoretext siblings?
[20:39:37] <Velveeta> raptorjesus: btw, momentjs is 10k minified and gzipped, so it's minimal overhead
[20:40:01] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, yes
[20:40:05] <RaptorJesus> meh
[20:40:11] <RaptorJesus> that's besides the point
[20:40:18] <Velveeta> then what's the point?
[20:40:31] <RaptorJesus> i'm drunk and scripting
[20:40:34] <RaptorJesus> that's the point
[20:40:35] <Velveeta> christech2: you can use .nextAll() or .siblings() depending on whether the dom order is important or not
[20:40:47] <Velveeta> raptorjesus: well that's different, you should be on twitter then
[20:40:52] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, alright, trying that now
[20:41:05] <RaptorJesus> and I want to know who I can bitch to have javascript include an easy way to format time
[20:41:27] <acidjazz> Velveeta:for ie 10+ only in my code Im getting  "Invalid Character" for json = window.JSON.parse(result.response);
[20:41:31] <RaptorJesus> in the next version
[20:41:32] <Velveeta> christech2: if dom order is important, and you only want those nodes that come after the parent(), then use .nextAll(), if you just want all siblings of those classes, regardless of dom order, use .siblings()
[20:41:36] <acidjazz> Velveeta: where as its perfectly fine JSON in chrome/etc
[20:42:15] <Velveeta> acidjazz: i've run into that problem in the past, if it's what i'm thinking it is, and i'm not sure why it seems to happen sporadically, but see if this helps:
[20:42:36] <Velveeta> JSON.parse('[' + result.response + ']')[0];
[20:43:06] <acidjazz> Velveeta: well even if i console.log(result); i get SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support this property or method
[20:43:11] <Velveeta> sometimes, when trying to parse an object literal string, which is an actual object (e.g. {sdf: true}), it chokes the parser... but the parser doesn't have any problem parsing that as an array and taking the 0th index
[20:43:29] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what that console.log error is about
[20:43:32] <acidjazz> i see
[20:43:34] <Velveeta> i'd have to see that in action
[20:43:37] <acidjazz> ill jsut try your suggestion
[20:43:42] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, I can't use siblings() because there are other blocks of class somemoretext, I only want to select the next one. I believe nextAll() selects all of the same class name, too.
[20:44:07] <Velveeta> but sometimes, where a script chokes on this: '{"foo": true}' it won't choke on this: '[{"foo": true}]' and then reference [0]
[20:44:35] <Velveeta> christech2: so you only want the next('.sometext') and the .somemoretext that immediately follows .sometext?
[20:45:03] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, yes
[20:45:03] <acidjazz> Velveeta: still invalid character
[20:45:19] <Velveeta> acidjazz: can you create a jsfiddle out of what you're trying to parse so i can see it in action?
[20:45:42] <Velveeta> christech2: then you're gonna have to do another .add() with another long chain to add that into the current collection
[20:46:26] <Velveeta> or else do one of my other suggestions and create a function declaration or a variable function expression, and split those dom queries up into separate lines and pass your function to each chain
[20:46:52] <chrisTech2> I've tried this: $(this).siblings('.dial').add($(this).parent().next('.sometext')).add($(this).parent().next('.somemoretext')).toggle(function() {}); Didn't work, though.
[20:47:27] <RaptorJesus> yea that looks wrong
[20:47:31] <RaptorJesus> dunno why
[20:47:39] <acidjazz> Velveeta: well this is inside an xmlhtprequest... and the actual content is from a json file
[20:47:40] <Velveeta> christech2: $(this).parent().next('.somemoretext') will fail, because .sometext is the next sibling, not .somemoretext
[20:47:54] <acidjazz> Velveeta: any idae why i cant even console.log(result); ?
[20:48:14] <Velveeta> acidjazz: well if you can copy/paste that json content into a jsfiddle, the js parser will interpret it just the same as if it came from the xhr, and should choke on it the same
[20:48:39] <Velveeta> i'm not sure why you wouldn't be able to console.log it either, that's why i'd need to see an actual example..
[20:49:04] <Velveeta> what version of IE is that script438 being thrown in?
[20:49:33] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, Should I do 2 next()
[20:49:34] <chrisTech2> ?
[20:49:48] <Velveeta> yep
[20:50:10] <acidjazz> Velveeta: dont thinkt hisll help but http://jsfiddle.net/USuCX/
[20:50:22] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, thanks
[20:51:28] <Velveeta> acidjazz: i'd need to see the actual contents of config.json
[20:51:33] <acidjazz> ok
[20:51:52] <Velveeta> also, is there a reason you're using vanilla js for that xhr handling vs jquery's ajax methods?
[20:52:02] <Velveeta> i only ask since this is a jquery channel..
[20:52:15] <acidjazz> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/czZvFic6
[20:52:34] <acidjazz> Velveeta: because i need code to run thats IE8 compatible until i can redirect them
[20:52:46] <acidjazz> Velveeta: and that code wont run if jquery is loaded
[20:53:07] <Velveeta> i don't get it...... why doesn't that code run if jquery is loaded?
[20:53:17] <acidjazz> Velveeta: 1. raw vanilla JS does browser detection and redirects if its old, 2. load config file, 3. load scripts from config file
[20:54:27] <acidjazz> Velveeta: this is a bit much i know.. i might hard code the scripts and just async em instead..
[20:54:36] <acidjazz> Velveeta: but thisd be sweet if i could centralize this data
[20:55:02] <Velveeta> i'm still confused as to why whatever ie8-compatible vanilla js is there won't run if jquery is loaded
[20:55:22] <acidjazz> all this runs fine in ie8
[20:55:23] <dharmesh> whre
[20:55:26] <chrisTech2> Velveeta, since I've added a couple of things in my "this", how do I make it point to the first one?
[20:55:28] <acidjazz> my vanilla xmlhttp works great
[20:55:42] <Velveeta> except for the part where it doesn't work...
[20:55:58] <acidjazz> ever since i tried to load htis json file
[20:56:21] <acidjazz> maybe ill just hard code the script list.. and use jquery's $.getjson to load it eh
[20:57:07] <Velveeta> i'm still massaging this json file for a jsfiddle demo, to convert it into a string that i can try parsing
[20:57:26] <Velveeta> i have to escape 50-60 apostrophes, so it's taking a few minutes
[20:58:17] <acidjazz> Velveeta: fyi i am seeing ie10 do a network get on the file
[20:58:29] <acidjazz> Velveeta: oh just tell me ill regexp.. what od you want ' to be something else?
[20:58:41] <Velveeta> it just needs to be escaped to \'
[20:58:44] <acidjazz> Velveeta: actually how about this.. ill replace it w/ {"a simple": "one"}
[20:58:53] <acidjazz> 1sec
[20:58:56] <Velveeta> so that i can wrap the whole thing in a set of '' and treat it as a string, so JSON.parse can try to operate on it
[20:59:13] <Velveeta> yeah that'll work too, and we'll see if JSON.parse chokes on it
[20:59:56] <Velveeta> well, that works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/LQ2uU/
[21:00:15] <Velveeta> how about you regex escape all those apostrophes for me and i'll dump that into this fiddle and see if it chokes
[21:01:21] <acidjazz> oic
[21:01:36] <acidjazz> does htis work in IE10
[21:02:24] <acidjazz> yup it does
[21:02:30] <acidjazz> Velveeta: ok
[21:03:11] <acidjazz> Velveeta: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c1d40b1cfa079286d6ec
[21:04:00] <Velveeta> ok, that one threw an error
[21:04:14] <acidjazz> Velveeta: i just :%s/'/\\'/g
[21:04:23] <acidjazz> i thought ' inside " was valid for json though
[21:04:23] <Velveeta> yeah, that should be fine
[21:04:27] <acidjazz> my lint and parser say it is
[21:04:44] <Velveeta> it is valid for json, but if i turn it into a string for JSON.parse, i need those escaped
[21:05:13] <Velveeta> e.g. this: http://jsfiddle.net/NDa3k/1/
[21:05:36] <sacho_> what *are* you doing
[21:06:01] <acidjazz> oic
[21:06:22] <acidjazz> hmm
[21:06:40] <Velveeta> sacho_: trying to figure out why his json is choking the parser
[21:06:49] <sacho_> what json?
[21:07:13] <Velveeta> the big string of it at the jsfiddle link i posted?
[21:09:21] <sacho_> that's not a string
[21:09:29] <sacho_> you don't have any newline continuations
[21:09:48] <Velveeta> good call
[21:10:11] <sacho_> still doesn't explain what you're doing
[21:10:21] <acidjazz> newline continuations...
[21:10:27] <acidjazz> ok let me back up real quick and say again this is an IE only issue
[21:10:34] <acidjazz> every other browser calls this JSON
[21:10:57] <sacho_> "calls"?
[21:11:38] <Velveeta> he's making an xhr request to a json endpoint to retrieve this blob of json
[21:12:08] <Velveeta> and in his success callback, he's trying to run JSON.parse(result.responseText) and it's blowing up
[21:12:11] <acidjazz> ill just hard code the scripts i guess
[21:12:19] <acidjazz> result.response or result.responseText
[21:12:22] <acidjazz> cant even console.log(result);
[21:12:31] <acidjazz> i maybe should step back
[21:12:37] <acidjazz> load the scripts outside of the config
[21:12:46] <acidjazz> and not deal w/ xmlhttp/etc until i have jqueyr loaded
[21:12:59] <sacho_> so do you have an example
[21:13:22] <acidjazz> yeap that works
[21:13:25] <acidjazz> yea i have a jsfiddle
[21:14:45] <acidjazz> ohwell .. maybe when il have more time ill try and load that json via raw xmlhttp
[21:15:01] <sacho_> ..
[21:15:40] <acidjazz> so this version i run like this
[21:15:41] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/08b781fda8ddd5c3f5e6
[21:16:05] <acidjazz> it runs this
[21:16:06] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e866a61b6bd8070192b1
[21:16:36] <acidjazz> what this will do is either load hte scripts in that object of scripts asynchronousley and then callback when theyre loaded
[21:16:45] <acidjazz> or redirect them to /compat.html and return false
[21:17:03] <acidjazz> the reason is if I write JS that is not compatible w/ IE8.. that breaking will stop from any redirection needed
[21:17:21] <acidjazz> if you liek coffee https://gist.github.com/anonymous/514dfa4c30a21abf0693
[21:17:45] <sacho_> that's a lot of unrelated code
[21:17:55] <acidjazz> thats why i didn tpaste anything in the begining
[21:18:51] <sacho_> well, it's better if you paste related code
[21:19:02] <sacho_> for example, how you send a request, and then how you handle the response
[21:19:29] <acidjazz> sacho_: http://jsfiddle.net/USuCX/
[21:19:31] <acidjazz> that was the code
[21:19:33] <acidjazz> i ripped it out
[21:20:21] <acidjazz> i wonder if this is a bit more expensive.. async'ing all my js
[21:20:32] <sacho_> why are you..adding brackets around it?
[21:20:38] <acidjazz> that was a Velveeta suggestion
[21:20:51] <Velveeta> yup
[21:20:56] <acidjazz> [03:42] < Velveeta> acidjazz: i've run into that problem in the past, if it's what i'm thinking it is, and i'm not sure why it seems to happen sporadically, but see if this
[21:21:16] <sacho_> acidjazz, you're not passing your results to complete().
[21:21:19] <Velveeta> i've had json strings break the parser before, as an object literal, that parsed properly when wrapped in array brackets, at which point you can just take index 0 for your object
[21:21:56] <acidjazz> sacho_: in the xmlhttp function?
[21:22:30] <acidjazz> sacho_: pretty sure its not that.. thats basically xhconn pasted
[21:22:47] <acidjazz> http://xkr.us/code/javascript/XHConn/
[21:26:13] <acidjazz> all good i removed it so no reason to keep looking
[21:29:05] <sacho_> acidjazz, you are not passing any parameters at all to the complete() callback for your config function.
[21:29:59] <acidjazz> sacho_: no its just a callback to initiate success
[21:30:31] <acidjazz> sacho_: that way scripts that i load.. if i need to run stuff i cant run it until that callback fires
[21:31:58] <sacho_> so what version of IE does your problem appear on
[22:15:12] <jisan> need help
[22:15:38] <jisan> i want to add some values to a form when an user clicks on some buttons..
[22:15:49] <jisan> any jquery library for this?
[22:16:06] <jisan> i will need some features too...perhaps a library will have them
[22:19:41] <bradbrad> KevinM Nope, still stuck unforktunately!
[23:52:11] <trindaz> feature to make current document go fullscreen ("presentation mode"). Does jQuery do this?
