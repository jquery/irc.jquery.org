[00:30:45] <zkirill> Is it sane to call $( "#" + ui.helper[0].id ) inside a ui drag call back?
[00:32:46] <jrockjiggz> yes i do that sometimes
[00:33:14] <jrockjiggz> good question though. i don't know if its good or not

[00:35:54] <XMan2012> is it possible to validate my coupon code on the jquery validatation .....  well.. i did but i want to display all error inside the container div please look on here ... http://jsfiddle.net/QAHdL/2/
[00:36:40] <box> Can someone explain why this is blury? http://shares.ap.cdnx.co.uk/images/development/web/jquery/jquery-ui/troubleshooting/ss-dev-f46f-jquery-ui-date-picker-001.png I haven't changed anything and it's using theme ui-darkness.

[00:37:38] <XMan2012> it return this --- success: function(response){    if(response == 0){     $('#couponInvalid').show('border', '3px #C33 solid');   $('#tick').hide();    $('#cross').fadeIn();   }else{  $('#coupon').css('border', '3px #090 solid');  $('#cross').hide();   $('#tick').fadeIn();  }
[00:38:26] <XMan2012> instead of fadein and hide... may it possible to display it inside the container div with a new alert message
[01:07:38] <jammsen> hi guys
[01:07:49] <jammsen> is it possbile to watch on more events?
[01:08:17] <jammsen> instead of $('#friendsPopup .slider').mouseenter(function() { like $('#friendsPopup .slider, #friendsPopup .slider2').mouseenter(function() {
[01:10:00] <xec> jammsen: you can listen to both multiple events and events on multiple elements
[01:10:17] <jammsen> xec: is the syntax right?
[01:10:55] <xec> jammsen: depends on what you want to achieve, that will only listen to mouseenter, on elements matching either selector
[01:11:04] <xec> ?tias @ jammsen
[01:11:04] <bot-t> jammsen, Try It And See
[01:11:25] <jammsen> xec: open a slider, with friendlist
[01:14:11] <xec> jammsen: if you can't get it working, we could benefit from seeing the bigger picture, show us your code, see ?demo
[01:14:11] <bot-t> jammsen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:14:57] <FredyWork> hello, i have a (hopefully) quick question, i just discovered (yeah) deferreds and now i playing with it little and i am little bit confused about one thing...can talk with somebody about it ?
[01:15:19] <xec> ?ask @ FredyWork
[01:15:19] <bot-t> FredyWork, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:15:22] <VeXii> youre talking right now :)
[01:15:41] <FredyWork> :D
[01:16:03] <jammsen> xec: i try it myself first, i got the answer from you when i got a problem i will ask again, thanks
[01:16:17] <phat_code^> whats the best deep-linking plugin that will work with ajax dropdowns
[01:16:24] <xec> good luck mate :)
[01:16:38] <jammsen> ty
[01:17:05] <jammsen> xec: it runs perfectly, thanks a million =)
[01:17:07] <FredyWork> allright, what i want to do is ajax for a html template, when it's loaded, i want to compiled that template and resolve deferred, so handlers will recieve that template compiled in arguments
[01:17:33] <FredyWork> if i understand correctly, deferred is resolved when ajax is finished
[01:17:33] <phat_code^> anyone can help a n00b
[01:17:37] <phat_code^> ?
[01:18:17] <FredyWork> so how can i compile that template and resolve it with that ? do i need another deferred to wrap around it ?
[01:24:01] <FredyWork> is that question of mine so intimidating ? :)
[01:24:20] <FredyWork> everybody gone silent...
[01:24:43] <phat_code^> maybe they are sleeping
[01:33:15] <zealiod> Hey, Im doing this to get the screen size of an image… $(this).children("img").width() - but its returning the dimensions of the source image, not the CSS width - how can I get the css width of the image?
[01:37:28] <XMan2012> what is wrong on my query  ---- $query  = "UPDATE coupons SET coupon_current_status='invalid' WHERE coupon =".$_POST['coupon'];	$query .= "; INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('$firstname', '$lastname', '$email')";
[01:37:32] <XMan2012> please help me out
[01:37:58] <zealiod> XMan2012: Your in the wrong channel
[01:38:08] <zealiod> you need php or mysql
[01:38:28] <XMan2012> sorry
[01:38:44] <Alan> XMan2012: pretty much everything is wrong with that line of PHP
[01:38:46] <zealiod> XMan2012: however… check that you have quotes around your WHERE clause
[01:39:15] <zealiod> XMan2012: Yeah, also you need 3 values to go in 3 fields in your INSERT
[01:39:37] <Alan> nobody going to point out that he's assembling a query from user input?
[01:40:20] <zealiod> heh
[01:40:29] <xec> Alan: no, we are all going to use that database later on
[01:40:31] <Alan> especially useful since his database connector apparently supports multi-statement queries
[01:40:39] <zealiod> Alan: that's cool right - all my password forms are that way :/
[01:41:25] <Alan> also, i really don't get how somebody can be aware of the .= operator but not the . operator
[01:41:52] <xec> well, he does use it before the $_POST...
[01:42:03] <Alan> almost excusable that they're not aware of "{$foo['bar']}" for non-trivial variable substitiution
[01:42:09] <Alan> right
[01:42:37] <molavy> i want create div that grow automatically width by it contents, but after some growing it stop growing, max growing depend on screen size, but i want make it growing width even it text was about an book
[01:42:38] <Alan> which furthers my opinion that that person shouldn't be let anywhere near a PHP interpreter until he learns a bit more about PHP :P
[01:43:05] <Alan> this is why i hate PHP so much - you always have idiots who can't program PHP programming it anyway
[01:43:15] <Alan> most other languages punish you for not knowing what you're doing
[01:43:49] <Alan> your average PHP programmer: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmva2mQD3Q1qiyh9no1_500.jpg
[01:44:10] <Alan> </rant>
[01:44:23] <Alan> and now back to our feature presentation

[01:44:39] <xec> xD
[01:47:26] <mazzachre> A "wonderful" customer have complained that our webapp does not work in IE... By "does not work" I have gathered from debugging on another machines with IE installed that the javascript is not doing anything... It is really simple, a self restarting ajax request (simple update), I am guessing it might be IE not accepting application/json as datatype for the data?
[01:54:56] <clear-in> hi.. i have a <select name="plan.country[0].id" id="country_0"> and <select name="plan.city[0].id" id="city_0">. the "0" there is dynamic and thats the index. what is the best way to select those elements?
[01:55:08] <FredyWork> ok, nobody had anything on my question, so here is little example... http://jsfiddle.net/FredyC/3pynD/
[01:55:21] <FredyWork> what's wrong in there, why there is no resolve function ?
[02:04:16] <clear-in> hi.. i have a <select name="plan.country[0].id" id="country_0"> and <select name="plan.city[0].id" id="city_0">. the "0" there is dynamic and thats the index. what is the best way to select those elements?
[02:05:44] <josemota> hi everyone. In the autocomplete control, is it possible to change the value property to something else? Or does the server have to force it?
[02:15:43] <XMan2012> is it possible to validate my coupon code on the jquery validatation .....  well.. i did but i want to display all error inside the container div please look on here ... http://jsfiddle.net/QAHdL/2/
[02:15:53] <XMan2012> instead of fadein and hide... may it possible to display it inside the container div with a new alert message
[02:21:13] <mbrevda_> jQuery UI's menu() seems to prevent selecting a checkbox in a menu: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy67F/6/
[02:21:18] <mbrevda_> any ideas on how to work around?
[02:22:13] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[02:23:41] <Cork> mbrevda_: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy67F/7/
[02:25:35] <mbrevda_> Cork: thanks, that makes it seems so simple!
[02:26:11] <mbrevda_> what I don't get is that it would seem that menu itself is set to prevent this: event.preventDefault();
[02:26:26] <mbrevda_> is your code preventing the prevention?
[02:30:34] <Cork> mbrevda_: the click event escalates and the menu event does event.preventDefault
[02:31:14] <Cork> mbrevda_: the parctical click event on the checkbox happens after its propriated through the tree
[02:31:36] <mbrevda_> so it happened after the event.preventDefault?
[02:31:37] <Cork> so the event.preventDefault() in the parent element will stop it
[02:31:51] <mbrevda_> oh, it happens first
[02:32:02] <Cork> click on the checkbox happens, the click event happens on the checkbox
[02:32:08] <Cork> the click event happens on the menu object
[02:32:20] <Cork> the click event goes up the tree until the window object
[02:32:32] <Cork> then the native click action on the checkbox happen
[02:32:43] <mbrevda_> is that whats called bubbling?
[02:32:47] <Cork> is none of the earlies events did event.preventDefault()
[02:32:50] <Cork> yes
[02:33:03] <Cork> thats why stopPropagation() works
[02:33:18] <mbrevda_> and so here were preventing bubbling. Got it, cool, thanks!
[02:33:29] <Cork> np
[02:35:41] <clear-in> hi. $.post("continent_to_countries.jsp", destination_form.serialize() , function(response){...}) ., in destination_form.serialize() i want to add more data after that. how will i do it? i tried {destination_form.serialize(), my_var : "123" } it gives me error message.
[02:36:03] <mbrevda_> item1 + item2
[02:36:21] <Cork> or serializeArray
[02:36:25] <Cork> ?.serializeArray
[02:36:25] <aaronmcadam> no clear-in
[02:36:26] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:36:33] <aaronmcadam> you need to make a temp array and push em all on
[02:36:36] <Cork> then just join them
[02:36:42] <aaronmcadam> aye
[02:37:16] <aaronmcadam> [destination_form.serialize()].push({my_var : "123"}) maybe
[02:37:26] <Cork> nope
[02:37:32] <aaronmcadam> array
[02:37:37] <Cork> that will send the form as a param string in an array
[02:37:52] <Cork> serialize generates a string
[02:37:53] <aaronmcadam> with serializeArray
[02:37:56] <aaronmcadam> I meant
[02:38:09] <clear-in> ok tnx  guys im viewing now the sample in serializearray
[02:38:12] <aaronmcadam> that's what i did before
[02:38:31] <Cork> destination_form.serializeArray().join([['my_var', '123']]) should be farly close
[02:38:51] <aaronmcadam> why not push
[02:38:59] <Cork> heh true :)
[02:39:09] <Cork> destination_form.serializeArray().push(['my_var', '123'])
[02:39:12] <aaronmcadam> that join's a bit hacky
[02:39:18] <Cork> ya
[02:39:30] <aaronmcadam> would u not need to wrap it
[02:39:44] <Cork> why serializeArray returns an array
[02:39:51] <aaronmcadam> i thought it was name : x, val : x
[02:40:02] <Cork> thats an object
[02:40:05] <Cork> this is an array
[02:40:05] <aaronmcadam> yes i know
[02:40:49] * Cork still wonders why there isn't a serializeObject()
[02:41:00] <aaronmcadam> I just map it
[02:41:05] <aaronmcadam> to my own serialize func
[02:41:12] <Cork> map returns an array
[02:41:20] <aaronmcadam> not exclusively
[02:41:30] <aaronmcadam> I return an obj out of it
[02:41:43] <Cork> no you can return an object liky array
[02:41:47] <Cork> it always returns an array
[02:41:47] <aaronmcadam> and map works on objects too
[02:41:59] <Cork> ya, but it always returns an array
[02:42:08] <aaronmcadam> ur not following me
[02:42:11] <aaronmcadam> it's my own function
[02:42:18] <aaronmcadam> that's using map in it
[02:42:26] <aaronmcadam> but not returning map
[02:42:49] <aaronmcadam> https://gist.github.com/1173161
[02:42:49] <Cork> why don't you use each instead?
[02:42:51] <aaronmcadam> see
[02:43:10] <Cork> why use map???
[02:43:20] <Cork> that just returns uneeded arrays
[02:43:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah I was right
[02:43:28] <Cork> and cause the gc to work for no reason
[02:43:31] <aaronmcadam> it returns a list of objects
[02:43:42] <aaronmcadam> so you can't just push on [1,2]
[02:43:43] <Cork> of cource it does
[02:43:46] <Cork> as you don't use map
[02:43:49] <aaronmcadam> it must be { 1, 2 }
[02:43:54] <aaronmcadam> nevermind that
[02:44:00] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking bout the problem that guy had
[02:44:05] <clear-in>  hi.. i have a <select name="plan.country[0].id" id="country_0"> and <select name="plan.city[0].id" id="city_0">. the "0" there is dynamic and thats the index. what is the best way to select the elements?
[02:44:47] <aaronmcadam> {
[02:44:47] <aaronmcadam>     name: "a",
[02:44:47] <aaronmcadam>     value: "1"
[02:44:47] <aaronmcadam>   },
[02:45:23] <Cork> ah, its an array of objects
[02:45:30] <aaronmcadam> yes that's what i was saying
[02:45:39] <Cork> must have mixed it up with another lib then
[02:46:07] <Cork> destination_form.serializeArray().push({ name:'my_var', value:'123'}) then :)
[02:46:09] <aaronmcadam> which is why i wanted to map it to another
[02:46:21] <aaronmcadam> cuz i wanted { input_name : val }
[02:46:29] <aaronmcadam> instead of n: name, v : val
[02:46:31] <Cork> but you don't want map
[02:46:33] <Cork> you want each
[02:46:42] <Cork> each always returns a map, so its the wrong function
[02:46:47] <Cork> uh..
[02:46:55] <Cork> that became sooo wrong >_<
[02:47:08] <aaronmcadam> sure did
[02:47:12] <Cork> map always returns an array, so its the wrong function
[02:51:14] <Cork> aaronmcadam: the simplest way i can think of is $.serializeObject = function{ var values = {}; $.each(self.serializeArray(), function() { values[this.name] = this.value; }); return values; };
[02:52:01] <aaronmcadam> self? just use proxy
[02:52:15] <Cork> bah that cam out of habbit :)
[02:52:20] <Cork> s/self/this/
[02:52:20] <aaronmcadam> $.proxy( func..., this)
[02:52:58] <aaronmcadam> I'm moving away from that old pattern of grabbing this before each calls
[02:53:02] <Kentrel> Why did my jquery plugin script refuse to work until I put the code at the bottom of the page?
[02:53:03] <aaronmcadam> or any callbacks
[02:53:21] <aaronmcadam> Kentrel: u must not have been using doc ready
[02:53:27] <Cork> aaronmcadam: proxy does the exact same thing, just with more calls
[02:53:40] <Kentrel> oh you might be right
[02:54:02] <aaronmcadam> it's an analog to func.bind
[02:54:14] <aaronmcadam> well, I'm using _.bind but proxy is the same thing
[02:54:45] <Cork> my point was that your spending more time doing that then just simply saving the variable in the local scope
[02:55:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah but it's a better pattern in my opinion
[02:56:06] <amcsi_work> hello
[02:56:28] <amcsi_work> is the a method like find(), but that includes the previous matched elements for searching?
[02:56:40] <blackspotwiggins> ?andself @ amcsi_work
[02:56:40] <bot-t> amcsi_work, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[02:56:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah andSelf is handy
[02:57:00] <blackspotwiggins> thank you for taking the time to come to irc instead of reading the api docs
[02:57:09] <amcsi_work> that's not good, that always adds the previous set, even if it doesn't match with the find selector
[02:57:12] <blackspotwiggins> feel free to leave as soon as you get your answer
[02:57:41] <amcsi_work> see my problem?
[02:58:33] <aaronmcadam> that's weird
[02:58:50] <blackspotwiggins> that's exactly what you asked
[02:59:04] <blackspotwiggins> it is find and it includes the previous matched elements
[02:59:07] <aaronmcadam> what exactly do u want cuz andSelf works like $('div').find('p').andSelf() will return the div and p
[02:59:35] <aaronmcadam> if u want something else, use .end() and go back up if u want
[02:59:48] <amcsi_work> I'm doing find by class, and the previous matched elements may or may not have the class I'm searching for
[03:00:10] <blackspotwiggins> so use that class in find
[03:00:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah what's the problem?
[03:00:26] <aaronmcadam> we need a fiddle here i think
[03:00:32] <amcsi_work> yes, but that doesn'T search within the previous matched elements
[03:00:43] <amcsi_work> I want to search in the previous matched elements and the descendants
[03:00:47] <blackspotwiggins> ?filter @ amcsi_work
[03:00:48] <bot-t> amcsi_work, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[03:01:00] <blackspotwiggins> again, the documentation is for idiots and losers
[03:01:03] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:01:16] <amcsi_work> okay, but that will do some redundant filtering. Is that what you would do still?
[03:01:20] <aaronmcadam> let's just play guess the API
[03:02:08] <aaronmcadam> well a filter by definition will test the whole set
[03:02:37] <aaronmcadam> so your "redundancy" is moot there really i think
[03:02:45] <amcsi_work> yes, but find already does fuilteing of the descendants
[03:02:59] <blackspotwiggins> this is why we cant have nice things
[03:03:03] <aaronmcadam> hehehe
[03:03:11] * blackspotwiggins back to lurking
[03:03:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah but you'll still need to filter the set to check for parents if that's what ur looking for
[03:03:36] <aaronmcadam> this would be much easier if you made a jsfiddle
[03:03:45] <aaronmcadam> instead of trying to guess what you want
[03:05:58] <amcsi_work> thank you. no, I wasn't searching for parents, and also, I assume now that parent checking only looks up until the area I'm looking at, therefore parent checking in closest() would always fail.
[03:06:08] <amcsi_work> but thank you for your help
[03:06:42] <aaronmcadam> hmm ok
[03:32:38] <ciro_nunes> clear
[03:32:46] <clear-in> ?
[03:43:21] <larsemil> how do i delegate two different things, is that possible. like $('.class or #id').delegate()
[03:43:50] <aaronmcadam> larsemil: just comma separate
[03:44:12] <aaronmcadam> larsemil: and the first selector should be the context of where the elements are
[03:44:45] <larsemil> i want to delegate click on links in either of two classes
[03:44:49] <aaronmcadam> so $( '#container').delegate( '.class,#id', 'click', function(){...});
[03:44:58] <aaronmcadam> and use the new on api
[03:45:04] <aaronmcadam> so the above becomes
[03:45:11] <aaronmcadam> $( '#container').on( '.class,#id', 'click', function(){...});
[03:46:15] <larsemil> aaronmcadam: it worked as i wanted now
[03:46:46] <larsemil> $('.class1, .class2').delegate('a.nav', 'click', function()
[03:47:00] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[03:47:10] <aaronmcadam> u on 1.7?
[03:47:28] <larsemil> 1.6.4
[03:47:29] <aaronmcadam> you can swap the word delegate for "on" and it works the same way
[03:47:31] <aaronmcadam> oh kk
[03:47:46] <larsemil> .on == .delegate
[03:47:46] <aaronmcadam> $.fn.on unifies the event apis
[03:47:48] <aaronmcadam> no
[03:47:58] <aaronmcadam> depending on method signature
[03:48:08] <aaronmcadam> 1.7 will use on underneath anyway
[03:48:13] <larsemil> ah i see
[03:48:14] <aaronmcadam> but best to call it directly
[03:48:47] <aaronmcadam> so if u don't pass a context, it uses the live functionality, .i.e binding to the document without context
[03:49:08] <aaronmcadam> if u don't pass anything, it just binds a click with event propagation
[03:49:58] <aaronmcadam> larsemil: overview here: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[03:51:31] <Aamir> how die works? http://jsfiddle.net/Stcu9/ :/
[03:51:44] <aaronmcadam> die? just unbinds
[03:52:14] <Aamir> aaronmcadam: why it ends on infinite loop
[03:52:21] <aaronmcadam> huh
[03:52:47] <aaronmcadam> u need to prevent default before anything
[03:53:03] <Aamir> aaronmcadam: let me try
[03:53:24] <aaronmcadam> and don't use live
[03:53:28] <aaronmcadam> it's a dead api lol :D
[03:53:32] <aaronmcadam> deprecated
[03:53:48] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  i know but cannot upgrade jQuery lib for now :(
[03:53:58] <aaronmcadam> yuck
[03:54:00] <aaronmcadam> which version
[03:54:03] <Aamir> but anyway need to know why die is not working here :/
[03:54:07] <Aamir> 1.3
[03:54:42] <aaronmcadam> ok, but ur fiddle is set to 1.6.4 might help if ur actually testing against what ur using
[03:55:32] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  i know its hard to explain why i used newer version but ignore this version issue
[03:55:44] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  if u have better example of die
[03:56:00] <aaronmcadam> i think ur doing it wrong
[03:56:11] <Aamir> aaronmcadam: gr8. where? :P
[03:56:41] <Kentrel> Any of you know how to make jquery's datepicker include time as well. My input field goes directly to a mysql datetime. Since implementing the datepicker I had to make a seperate field for the time, and then combine the two in my model\controller
[03:56:56] <Aamir> aaronmcadam: i want to run the binder method only once using .live
[03:57:00] <aaronmcadam> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/Stcu9/1/
[03:58:40] <aaronmcadam> Aamir: is that what u want
[03:59:04] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  i know it worked with 1.3 :P
[03:59:17] <aaronmcadam> are u trying to upgrade?
[04:00:00] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  i have one app. upgrading bit by bit to newer version so to make sure old code do not break
[04:00:13] <Aamir> an upgrade is breaking this code
[04:00:14] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:00:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:00:50] <katnegermis> Is there any way to programmatically select the first item, in a jquery-ui autocomplete box? I want a hotkey to trigger this event.
[04:00:53] <aaronmcadam> it's the trigger Aamir
[04:00:59] <aaronmcadam> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/Stcu9/5/
[04:01:03] <Aamir> looks like a bug in 1.6 isn't it?
[04:01:18] <aaronmcadam> very unlikely not to be
[04:01:23] <aaronmcadam> what ur doing is a bit silly
[04:01:36] <aaronmcadam> why are u triggering the event?
[04:03:27] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  read http://jsfiddle.net/Stcu9/6/
[04:03:30] <Aamir> comments
[04:04:30] <Aamir> triggering an event will show the tooltip otherwise you will not see the tooltip on first hover which will just start the plugin but on next hover it will work
[04:07:11] <phat_code^> anyone know how to use the asual jquery address plugin?
[04:10:40] <katnegermis> Do you guys know if there is any way to programmatically select the first item, in a jquery-ui autocomplete box? I want a hotkey to trigger this event, but I got this part covered :)
[04:11:44] <phat_code^> http://belphegor.us can anyone tell me how to get http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/ to work with my site
[04:12:55] <Aamir> katnegermis:  trigger its select event http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select
[04:12:57] <Aamir> ?
[04:14:05] <katnegermis> Aamir, I tried that, but I can't find any documentation on how I'm supposed to do that.
[04:14:47] <katnegermis> Aamir, This is how I guessed it was supposed to be called, but I'm getting pretty sure that this is wrong :( $('#findProduct_' + id).autocomplete('option','select').call(selectObject);
[04:14:51] <katnegermis> whoops
[04:15:17] <Aamir> katnegermis:  autocompleteElement.autocomplete(…………).trigger('select', [  { /*  create UI object here. check docs  */ }  ])
[04:15:36] <katnegermis> Aamir, Thanks, I'll give it a shot!
[04:16:36] <Aamir> katnegermis:  autocompleteElement.autocomplete(…………);    onYourCustomEventOrHotKeyEtc,   autocompleteElement.trigger('select', [  { /*  create UI object here. check docs  */ }  ])
[04:17:47] <cubix> Aamir:
[04:17:59] <Aamir> cubix:
[04:18:02] <cubix> mistake, sry… my irc client is acting up
[04:18:13] <Aamir> ok :P
[04:22:56] <katnegermis_> Aamir, Could you point me to the place of the documentation? I'm pretty new to jQuery, and I can't seem to find any useful documentation :'(
[04:23:45] <Aamir> katnegermis_:  try to make a fiddle and than explain your exact problem in details to get help
[04:23:50] <Aamir> ?ask
[04:23:51] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:24:16] <Aamir> sorry not that one, this one ?demo
[04:24:26] <Aamir> damnit
[04:25:36] <katnegermis_> I want to programmatically select the first item from the dropdown menu of a jquery-ui autocomplete, when a hotkey is pressed. E.g. pressing TAB will select the first item on the list
[04:26:09] <Aamir> katnegermis_:  you need to type something to see the autocomplete list, don't you?
[04:27:08] <katnegermis_> Yeah. If I type 'Co', I would get a list of 'Coca cola', 'Coca cola light' etc. If I decide that the first one is the one I want, I just press TAB to choose it
[04:27:32] <Aamir> katnegermis_:  ok now thats a clear question :P wait
[04:30:56] <Benn>  katnegermis_: You need to have a event listener on key down for the input element that contains an if statement for the keycode of the button you wish to use, that then finds the first child of the list and passes it
[04:31:48] <Benn> Does that make sense to you?
[04:32:20] <Benn> Tab is keycode 9
[04:33:00] <katnegermis_> Benn yea, I already did that :) Now I just need a way to select the first item from the autocomplete-thingy
[04:33:24] <Benn> What do you mean by select
[04:34:36] <katnegermis_> The autocomplete-thingy makes a dropdown menu, where you can select one of the items that are suggested. I want a hotkey to always choose the first one
[04:35:08] <Benn> So it just fills an text input field?
[04:36:08] <katnegermis_> Benn, It should trigger the autocomplete.select event. I have a bit of stuff happening in that event :)
[04:36:58] <blackspotwiggins> katnegermis_, just use autoFocus option
[04:37:00] <Benn> how does it normally get triggered?
[04:37:18] <katnegermis_> Benn, by a mouse click by the user
[04:38:13] <katnegermis_> blackspotwiggins, Oh my, you are right. I even played around with that function earlier, but couldn't get it to work!
[04:38:34] <katnegermis_> blackspotwiggins, I must have done something wrong earlier, because it works perfectly now! :)
[04:38:47] <katnegermis_> blackspotwiggins, Thanks!
[04:38:50] <blackspotwiggins> np
[04:50:31] <hourd> why?
[04:50:38] <timing> BFG: dud fix your irc client
[04:56:41] <mazzachre> I think it is a troll
[04:56:47] <mazzachre> kick ban
[04:57:28] <mazzachre> At least it seems like a script gone horribly wrong
[04:57:52] <hourd> indeed
[04:57:59] <hourd> needs an op to kick
[05:00:41] <Cork> it might be caused by the netsplit a bit back
[05:01:24] <Cork> ah, no it was active before that
[05:01:40] <mikeFisher> so, if I wan to select all the able rows that have the foo or bar class ... is it $('tr .foo,.bar');
[05:02:01] <Cork> nope
[05:02:05] <mikeFisher> oh
[05:02:11] * mikeFisher looks sad
[05:02:15] <Cork> $('tr.foo, tr.bar')
[05:02:27] <mikeFisher> ah, thanks
[05:02:50] <Cork> comma starts a completly new selector
[05:06:57] <minver> How can I add an extra class to the Menu element in the autocomplete widget?
[05:08:33] <katnegermis_> Is it normal, that when a new (html) input is added to a page, the focus gets moved to that input?
[05:09:49] <VeXii> katnegermis_ dont think so
[05:13:29] <phrearch> hello
[05:17:20] <Cork> man this is annoying...
[05:18:00] <katnegermis> VeXii, You were right. Thanks :-)
[05:18:13] <phrearch> anyone knows how to use requirejs' require function with a random sized array of modules?

[05:26:34] <m1chael> sente: i am, server side
[05:27:04] <XMan2012> VeXii: if you may have a look on the code.... there is coupon validation field .... which is check through a function named coupon_check()
[05:27:26] <m1chael> i see some pretty girl in a field, a christmas tree, some plant life
[05:27:41] <XMan2012> i just want to display if the coupon is not valid then it shows on the div container
[05:27:52] <VeXii> did you read the plugin doc?
[05:27:52] <XMan2012> first it checks if the coupon is valid or not
[05:28:27] <m1chael> they aren't stored in the link that says "view uploaded files"
[05:28:52] <XMan2012> yes... i read but there is nothing that i can show up on the div container
[05:29:55] <VeXii> have a go at the author then i dont know the plugin

[05:32:30] <m1chael> oooh nice
[05:32:41] <sente> m1chael: that's with using http://github.com/valums/file-uploader .. more or less
[05:32:42] <sente> tweaked though
[05:33:08] <sente> there are issues though, with people uploading 500MB files and such
[05:33:29] <m1chael> understandable
[05:33:53] <sente> bullshit issues, despite tweaking machine to allow any size
[05:34:05] <m1chael> thanks for the info sente: i've got to bring the baby to daycare now.. i'll be back! =)
[05:34:34] <sente> this is what I get for sticking with PHP and not not remaking the server side

[05:44:19] <Gulli> im trying to do it so I can iterate through it like an array
[05:44:19] <minver> Cork: but if I want to, is there an easy way? I figured out that I can access the menu element using input.data("autocomplete").menu.element
[05:44:54] <noinfo_de> Does anyone Heer have experiene with jquery + SVG? (Unsinn jquery.svg or otherwise)?
[05:45:11] <VeXii> Gulli: you can whith "for (cat in animals) {}"
[05:45:25] <Cork> minver: you can do a $(parent).find('.ui-corner-all').removeClass('ui-corner-all'), but other then that, no
[05:47:18] <sente> Gulli: the structure of that .json string looks wrong
[05:48:07] <sente> oh, turns out i'm just blind, sorry
[05:49:02] <Gulli> hmm

[05:55:44] <jayflux> anyone great with jQuery ui tabs?
[06:01:39] <jayflux> do i need ui.core and ui.widget or is the custom.1.8.16 one enough to use the jQuery ui?

[06:06:48] <a-l-e> any idea?
[06:07:23] <a-l-e> ... free...
[06:09:33] <a-l-e> ... i mean, i want a gallery with a few dozens of pictures... and i don't want to load them all on page loading!
[06:10:00] <ravenzz> do you googled about that?
[06:10:05] <a-l-e> yep...
[06:10:34] <a-l-e> i'm browsing through dozens of galleries...
[06:11:16] <a-l-e> most of them work with "<div><img src="..."><img src="...">...</div>
[06:11:40] <a-l-e> one seems to do what i want but there is no documentation or examples on how to do it :-(
[06:12:52] <a-l-e> i want to fill a js list and get the gallery to browse through it...
[06:13:23] <a-l-e> and since there are already dozens of galleries for jquery, i don't think it's a good idea to create one new...
[06:19:27] <a-l-e> i'll write my own script then... probably faster than looking for one...
[06:20:08] <Benn> Probably

[07:09:05] <bot-t> Onyx47, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[07:09:37] <Aamir> is what u need i guess
[07:10:10] <jayflux> Aamir:  yes
[07:11:05] <Onyx47> Aamir, still won't help because I want the mouseleave event to be prevented in certain cases... though I just got another idea of how to handle this, I could try animating a background with jqueryui, gonna give that a go
[07:11:51] <Aamir> Onyx47:  but u cannot bind two methods to mouse leave like u can for hover
[07:12:24] <Onyx47> Aamir, I'm not binding two of them, from docs: .bind( eventType [, eventData], preventBubble )
[07:12:50] <Onyx47> where preventBubble is a function returning false if you want to prevent the event from bubbling
[07:13:30] <Onyx47> aaand as I wrote that I realized I read the prototype wrong :P

[07:19:12] <andrew9183> thanks guys.  i love reading well written code, then i read over my code and what a difference it is
[07:19:24] <mikeFisher> Ang3: paste your code in jsfiddle.net and send link to channel
[07:19:51] <kborchers> srji: i would disagree but you can use the download builder and only get the pieces needed for autocomplete

[07:21:57] <Pallet> I've got a simple Mouse function for a DIV, which works, but ideally I'd like the mouseout to fade back to the original colour, just to look cooler

[07:29:48] <daggerhart> Hi all, I'm working on an html form and I'm trying to use jQuery clone() to make a backup of the form before the user starts editing it.  I keep running into problems with the clone being changed.  Is there a better way to accomplish this ?
[07:32:54] <daggerhart> I need a way to backup a form before the user starts editing it, that way they can click a 'cancel' button, and the form is replaced with the backup.  I may be using clone wrong, just would like some insight if anyone has recommendations.
[07:36:42] <jscheel> daggerhart: serialize
[07:36:53] <jscheel> daggerhart: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:37:11] <daggerhart> jscheel:   thanks.    so something like   var backup = jQuery('target').serialize()  ?
[07:37:49] <jscheel> daggerhart: sorry, serializeArray()

[07:38:04] <guynamedkeith> the vote happens today
[07:38:14] <guynamedkeith> basically censorship of U. S. internet
[07:38:17] <jscheel> daggerhart: but yeah that'll do it.
[07:38:57] <daggerhart> jscheel:   cool, i'll look into that.  is it straight forward enough to place the values back in the form if the user clicks cancel ?   is there an unserialize equivalent ?
[07:39:40] <iamcurio> i am looking to apply some effects to divs on page load rather than on click.. can i be pointed in the correct direction?
[07:40:13] <guynamedkeith> just run the effects on dom ready..
[07:40:29] <Eviltwin> daggerhart: You know that a input with type="cancel" undoes any user changes to the form, right?
[07:40:36] <Eviltwin> When clicked
[07:40:52] <Haprog> iamcurio: in short: $(function () { /*code tu run when page has loaded*/ });
[07:41:04] <daggerhart> Eviltwin:  wow, no i did not.   that pretty cross browser ?
[07:41:06] <Haprog> *to
[07:41:08] <phlp> type="reset"
[07:41:15] <Eviltwin> Sorry, yeah, by mad
[07:41:16] <Eviltwin> bad*
[07:41:20] <Eviltwin> my bad*
[07:41:29] <Eviltwin> Let me see what I can find as a good reference
[07:42:01] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_reset.asp
[07:42:14] <daggerhart> will that reset the entire form?  I just need to reset a part of the form.   The form is very large, and I'm showing/hiding different elements.  It's only the visible form items I need to reset
[07:42:32] <Haprog> Eviltwin: I think that it resets to the state that is defined in html, but what if the content's are loaded after page load using AJAX for example?
[07:43:00] <Haprog> it wouldn't know what the "default" state should be to reset to
[07:44:16] <Haprog> daggerhart: yes, a basic reset button just resets the values of the entire form. if you need something else. you need to make the functionality yourself.
[07:44:26] <Eviltwin> Sounds like something that needs to be tried
[07:46:09] <daggerhart> I'm willing to make whatever I need.   I have the entire program running smoothly, except the cancel button.  previously I've tried var backup = jQUery(target).clone(),   as well as moving the html of the form into a backup div.   both have issues, but I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't understand clone() correctly
[07:47:23] <jzaksh> hi :) I'm getting a really strange error with jquery 1.4.2.min.js where on running success callback for $.get() or $.ajax() I see this error: http://ompldr.org/vYmIwcg (that includes a console.log('data'); console.log(data); inside my success callback)
[07:47:32] <jzaksh> anyone have any idea how i can debug this?
[07:47:49] <Eviltwin> jzaksh: Make a jsFiddle example of your problem
[07:47:55] <Eviltwin> So that we can actually see the code and play with it

[07:48:08] <jzaksh> Eviltwin: thanks, will do
[07:48:54] <mikeFisher> Ang3: your html has lumps of unclosed <script> tags lying around half way through it
[07:49:12] <mikeFisher> oh, hes gone
[07:49:16] <jscheel> daggerhart: here's a very, very simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/nYsDp/
[07:49:38] <burhan> on this page: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/ - which part is binding the function to the change event of the select drop box?
[07:50:00] <jscheel> daggerhart: obviously, you will want to actually look at the element type to see how to update
[07:50:21] <phlp> daggerhart: https://github.com/cthielen/unserialize-to-form
[07:50:33] <burhan> my logic is "if selected value is something", then toggle visiblity of div id #, I have the code for the check and the toggle, just don't know how to bind it to the event for the select.
[07:51:05] <daggerhart> jscheel:  that looks great!  Thank you, I'll attempt to implement this.   I haven't considered backing up the entire form, but that might just be the trick.
[07:51:07] <jscheel> daggerhart: yeah, what phlp said. Better to not re-invent the wheel
[07:51:38] <phlp> daggerhart: heres an apparently desuckified version by paul irish https://gist.github.com/854293
[07:52:28] <daggerhart> phlp:  Awesome.  gotta hate the sucktified stuff out there.    I'll give it a shot, greatly appreciated
[07:57:51] <burhan> can someone explain why there are two .change() in the example on this page? http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:58:42] <phlp> burhan: .change() with no params triggers the change event, same as .click()
[07:59:23] <burhan> phlp: do I need it twice if the code should fire when the user selects an option?
[08:00:11] <pachet> in the example, they're just firing it manually to illustrate the handler
[08:00:28] <burhan> okay
[08:00:38] <phlp> burhan: read the text above it "It then triggers the event for the initial text draw." it's not necessary but you wont see the text until a selection is actually made unless you trigger it with code the first time
[08:04:27] <burhan> or when someone selects something, right?
[08:05:47] <phlp> burhan: yes but there is a selection in the example by default before the user selects anything. you wont see the "Candy Caramel" under the box from that default selection unless you trigger the event
[08:06:44] <xckpd7> question: what is the difference between a plugin and a widget? I started converting a lot of my stuff into plugins and then some jQuery presentation slides said that sometimes what you're doing is a widget
[08:07:05] <Eviltwin> How are you doing your plugins?
[08:07:12] <Eviltwin> Are you using $.widget ?
[08:08:00] <xckpd7> Not yet... but I'm doing certain stuff on my site (I'm replacing a submit button with a prettier one) and I'm wondering if it makes more "semantic" sense to have it as either a plugin or a UI widget
[08:08:29] <burhan> I'm struggling with this :( http://dpaste.com/657518/ - it alerts the value 4 times?
[08:09:07] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: $.widget makes a lot of things a lot easier
[08:09:49] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: would you say it would make sense to read / follow this? https://github.com/rpflorence/talks/tree/master/2011-10-01-jqcon-boston
[08:11:04] <b0ot> I'm new to jquery and am trying to learn from example. Could someone explain to me what this line does:  $('<div>' + words[i-1] + '</div>').data( 'number', i ).appendTo( '#cardSlots' ).droppable( accept: '#cardPile div', hoverClass: 'hovered' , drop: handleCardDrop} );
[08:11:34] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I ended up browsing a bunch of the jQuery UI examples / built-ins and learned that way
[08:11:42] <phlp> burhan: i only see one alert http://jsfiddle.net/cQ9Vv
[08:11:44] <Eviltwin> Can't say it's the best way
[08:11:55] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: thanks I'll try it
[08:11:57] <Eviltwin> This doc seems reasonable
[08:12:18] <Eviltwin> b0ot: There's kind of a lot going on there
[08:12:24] <burhan> phlp: yes but when I run it, it actually pops the alert 4 times
[08:12:26] <pachet> b0ot: first you're creating a new jq object without adding it to the DOM (new div with innerHTML pulled from an array [words])
[08:12:27] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Why are you starting with such a complicated example
[08:13:03] <phlp> burhan: i know when i run it there is only one. did you try the one in the link i sent?
[08:13:05] <pachet> then you're assigning a value to 'number', an internal reference within the jq 'data' object for the div you just spawned
[08:13:31] <pachet> next you append that div to the DOM element with id 'cardSlots'
[08:13:32] <burhan> yeah - weird.
[08:13:50] <necromancer> b0ot
[08:13:53] <iamcurio> does anyone know how to change this code to make it work on load rather than click: http://dpaste.com/657522/
[08:13:55] <pachet> finally you invoke the jquery ui draggable plugin, with certain parameters
[08:14:07] <pachet> and now you fully understand jquery
[08:14:11] <b0ot> Eviltwin, I understand most of the other parts (it is a drag/drop tutorial) but this line was a little long
[08:14:13] <necromancer> ahaha\
[08:14:41] <Eviltwin> b0ot: So which part don't you understand?
[08:14:53] <mbrevda> (how) can I get the last time selected in a multi-select?
[08:15:13] <Eviltwin> mbrevda: What do you mean by that?
[08:15:29] <b0ot> Eviltwin, necromancer reading pachet's explanation
[08:15:31] <phlp> iamcurio: replace this with ".box" and remove lines 3 and 5
[08:15:39] <necromancer> b0ot: this is a better way of saying that https://gist.github.com/1370506
[08:15:45] <jzaksh> Eviltwin: hm. it could be I'm not reading the documentation properly, but.. maybe i'm not undersatnding $.ajax/$.get is the real problem.. this example doesn't even print data var http://jsfiddle.net/Yqfuh/
[08:15:49] <necromancer> also notice how droppable has an error in it, no opening brace
[08:15:53] <necromancer> i corrected that
[08:16:17] <mbrevda> Eviltwin:  <select multiple="multiple"… I want to limits the amount of items a user can select. Onchange I'm popping up an alert that they selected to many items. ut how can I uncheck the last one?
[08:16:50] <iamcurio> phlp: replace which? you don't say what to replace with?
[08:16:55] <jzaksh> whereas my real-life problem prints the data var returned from /echo/html/ but... there's a js error before it (which is like this:  http://ompldr.org/vYmIwcg )
[08:17:00] <kborchers> mbrevda: $("select option:selected").last().prop("selected", false); something like that
[08:17:32] <mbrevda> kborchers: thats assuming that the last item the user selected is the last item in the list
[08:17:35] <phlp> iamcurio: replace $(this) with $(".box") is what i meant. the "this" on line 4
[08:17:45] <mbrevda> that may have selected item 1 after all the others
[08:17:50] <jzaksh> so if anyone has any thoughts on the js error in my screenshot ^ would be awesome :)
[08:18:13] <burhan> phlp: this is strange - on firefox (and chrome) when I select something, I get 4 alert with the value, and then the select box changes; but my condition doesn't fire.
[08:18:28] <kborchers> mbrevda: right, sorry
[08:18:49] <mbrevda> I'm guessing that its somewhere in the event - I just don't know where
[08:20:26] <iamcurio> phlp: i have this now and still not working have i done it right? http://dpaste.com/657527/
[08:20:49] <b0ot> necromancer, pachet thanks... both explanations helped. necromancer I liked the way you formated it... I guess i need a better understanding of the jquery object. I'm trying to find a reference in the docs but Im not having much sucdess
[08:21:05] <daggerhart> phlp:  the unserializeForm plugin seems to be working great.  I appreciate it!
[08:21:07] <phlp> iamcurio: $(".box") with quotes
[08:21:08] <Eviltwin> iamcurio: You need to do $(".foo")
[08:21:13] <Eviltwin> Not $(.foo)
[08:21:31] <Eviltwin> People really need to learn JavaScript before jQuery...
[08:21:51] <mbrevda> whats javascript?
[08:21:59] <mbrevda> ;-)
[08:22:01] <iamcurio> simple mistake cool guys phlp: and Eviltwin:
[08:25:24] <YammYgirlcoding> morning all
[08:25:56] <necromancer> b0ot: that's how you formulate complicated jQuery plugins
[08:26:40] <b0ot> necromancer, do you have a reference where I could learn more about the jquery object? ie.. I get everything but what .data does but I can't figure out what to search for that would describe this
[08:27:37] <phlp> b0ot: http://api.jquery.com/data
[08:27:38] <bot-t> b0ot, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[08:28:36] <pachet> mbrevda: dunno if you're still working on this, but: http://jsfiddle.net/XP2aq/1/
[08:28:50] <necromancer> just easier to understand all your queries that way
[08:28:50] <necromancer> mbrevda: you know java? it's JUST like that
[08:28:50] <necromancer> except you know, a script
[08:29:14] <mbrevda> pachet: I think Ill stick with e.currentTarget.value :)
[08:29:35] <mbrevda> necromancer: oh - so if I know java I know jquery? Awesome!

[08:50:42] <aaronmcadam> likely mimetypes
[08:50:59] <k_89> aaronmcadam, its application/json
[08:51:01] <BauerUK_> regarding jquery's `data` method, supposed i want to print an array/object as the value of a data tag in the HTML, is that possible? or do i have to manually encode/decode it (using JSON)?
[08:51:29] <k_89> aaronmcadam, what do you use ??
[08:54:59] <thinkt4nk> BaurUK_ not sure what you mean by print an object as the value of a data tag, but you can assign objects with .data()
[08:55:46] <thinkt4nk> but if you're accessing the data object, and you use alert() or any other method that doesn't support an object, then yes, you'll have to serialize first
[08:57:13] <BauerUK_> thinkt4nk: i.e. <div data-foo=" ... ">
[08:57:50] <thinkt4nk> no html attribute is ever a javascript object
[08:58:04] <thinkt4nk> I'm not sure what you're trying to do
[08:58:11] <BauerUK_> ideally, you'd want to be able to print something like: <div data-foo="['bar','baz','quz']" /> and retrieve it using $("..").data("foo");
[08:58:47] <thinkt4nk> oic, so you're trying to serialize some data from the back-end
[08:59:36] <BauerUK_> well, that's trivial. i was hoping the .data method might be able to handle it?
[08:59:43] <phlp> BauerUK_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6071618
[08:59:47] <thinkt4nk> well you can do what you're doing, but instead of using data() to access the data, you would use .attr('data-foo') and deserialize it
[09:00:31] <thinkt4nk> holy crap, that post is almost EXACTLY his question, heh
[09:00:50] <_bogus_> hey there... do anyone knows a simple customizable carousel plugin that slides pictures horizontally (more than one pic in a 100% width container), with navigation ?
[09:02:13] <BauerUK_> ah, so it should work. seems my problem is with the printing then. gotta double escape those quotes! thanks phlp, thinkt4nk.

[09:14:08] <XMan2012> whenever i try to submit my form ... it shows me all input fields alert message
[09:14:26] <XMan2012> but ... whenever i insert just one input field value
[09:14:41] <XMan2012> and hit to the submit button without inserting another fields
[09:14:51] <XMan2012> it redirects to another page
[09:14:52] <fatguylaughing> Awesome don't see a doc page...
[09:15:07] <XMan2012> but it should not be redirect untill all fields are not validated
[09:15:21] <XMan2012> please help me you can see on here

[09:15:27] <jwm> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[09:15:58] <YoBaseIsMahFace> Eviltwin: Because having to see $(document).ready() in my code makes me want to wreak the office, smashing all the desks with people's faces, then jump out the window into an oncoming NYC taxi.
[09:16:13] <Eviltwin> Yup, troll
[09:16:41] <Jon47> YoBaselsMahFace … that's a pretty strong reaction...
[09:16:43] <YoBaseIsMahFace> Eviltwin: Unless you know of a way to avoid that .ready() thing?
[09:16:45] <Eviltwin> In my version, I made $(...) do the same thing as $(document).ready(...)
[09:17:12] <jwm> $(function() { }); = $(document).ready(function() { });
[09:17:28] <ajpiano> YoBaseIsMahFace: if you don't want to wait for document ready, just include your scripts at the very bottom of the body
[09:17:31] <ajpiano> problem solved
[09:17:43] <ajpiano> now you don't have to go and make your own js library
[09:17:45] <ajpiano> everybody wins
[09:18:03] <jwm> except the undertaker
[09:18:20] <Eviltwin> He also thinks .on and .off should be reversed
[09:18:23] <YoBaseIsMahFace> But I want to write my own js library anyway!!!
[09:18:29] <ajpiano> ?glwtd @ YoBaseIsMahFace
[09:18:29] <bot-t> YoBaseIsMahFace, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[09:18:57] <beefman> is there anything similar to .delay in jquery 1.3.2?
[09:19:14] <YoBaseIsMahFace> bot-t: Love the base64 image in the CSS
[09:19:16] <jwm> I've spent a few months coming up with some good names if you are writing your own js library, mootools, prototype, YUI, extjs
[09:19:19] <YoBaseIsMahFace> err, ajpiano
[09:19:20] <bot-t> YoBaseIsMahFace, 10 - Plugins - For each panel in the accordion, you will require both a panel (the content of our accordion pane) AND a handle (an item that is clicked to open a panel). These can be anything you want as you can ... http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?page=9&keywords=&type=All&sort_by=changed
[09:19:21] <jwm> you can use any of them if you wish
[09:19:33] <Eviltwin> beefman: You just need to catch the callback for the first one
[09:19:42] <Eviltwin> Then setTimeout to start the second
[09:19:50] <beefman> eviltwin: i don't get it.
[09:20:56] <fatguylaughing> jwm: If you have a minute? http://pastebin.com/HHzEBiyX
[09:21:00] <jwm> there is a .delay
[09:21:24] <hdon> hi all :) mobile question: why doesn't pageshow event fire the first time a page is shown?
[09:21:25] <Eviltwin> beefman: http://pastebin.com/8xAqjMGj
[09:21:27] <jedimind_> you're a .delay
[09:21:36] <hdon> is it possible i am not registering my event handler in time?
[09:21:53] <hdon> when will the first page be pageshow'n?
[09:21:56] <Eviltwin> jwm: He said he needs to work with 1.3.2
[09:22:02] <Eviltwin> jwm: .delay was introduced 1.4
[09:22:05] <jwm> ohh I missed that
[09:22:41] <mrryanjohnston> How can I detect how an element has been added to the page, such as a div?
[09:22:51] <Eviltwin> mrryanjohnston: There's nothing standard for it
[09:22:52] <mrryanjohnston> (if I don't have access to the code itself)
[09:22:54] <beefman> eviltwin: gotcha.  ty much
[09:23:14] <jwm> hdon: have you tried just using .load
[09:23:39] <hdon> hmm, that's a good idea
[09:23:53] <hdon> wait
[09:23:57] <hdon> that's not what i think it is
[09:24:04] <XMan2012> My page is redirecting to another page whenever i insert a field value and leave others empty, all of fields must be validated ... pplease let me  know what wrong with it....
[09:24:06] <XMan2012> http://samirayousefi.com/metodum/curso_crea_tu_marca_personal_groupalia
[09:24:29] <hdon> jwm: how do you recommend applying .load()?
[09:24:45] <hdon> oh yes it is
[09:24:49] <hdon> i was just viewing the wrong doc page
[09:25:15] <tomasm-> hdon, what is "pageshow"?
[09:25:21] <jwm> its suppose to be onpageshow
[09:25:26] <jwm> html5 event
[09:25:30] <jwm> IE doesn't support it
[09:25:31] <jwm> heh
[09:25:36] <hdon> tomasm-: a jquery mobilism
[09:25:50] <hdon> ?
[09:26:44] <jwm> I have had poor success with trying to bind to onload
[09:27:15] <jwm> I kind of just use my own routine that waits till document is ready and then sets a timeout waiting for all the images I use to load
[09:27:18] <hdon> jwm: this is the pageshow to which i refer: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[09:27:32] <therealfakemoot> Is there a way to determine the size of hte PAGE rather than the viewport?
[09:28:06] <jwm> nice I haven't played with jquery mobile
[09:28:22] <jwm> but I don't believe in separate libraries for this kind of thing
[09:28:44] <Eviltwin> therealfakemoot: Have you tried $("body").width() and $("body").height() ?
[09:28:47] <tomasm-> how might i handle parsing the query string for firing events? ie passing fadeIn=DOMID, etc....
[09:28:48] <therealfakemoot> hm
[09:29:03] <therealfakemoot> Eviltwin: that might work
[09:29:24] <andrew9183> does anyone know what the term is called when a section of a page loads while the rest of the page is already loaded ?
[09:29:37] <andrew9183> ie i want my site to load fast, and then have the sections which require loading show a loading icon
[09:29:42] <Eviltwin> therealfakemoot: http://api.jquery.com/ is giving me a $("body").height() of 20729
[09:29:47] <Eviltwin> therealfakemoot: Definitely not the window size
[09:30:02] <hdon> i realize i will probably be flooded with tons and tons of info, but can i get jquery to log EVERY event to the console?
[09:30:06] <jedimind_> you dont have a 20,000pixel tall monitor ?
[09:30:07] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Sounds like lazy loading
[09:30:10] <jedimind_> poor sap
[09:30:13] <Eviltwin> jedimind_: Not yet
[09:31:03] <tomasm-> can scrollTo() be chained like j('#div').hide().scrollTo().fadeIn(); ?
[09:31:21] <ajpiano> hdon: according to the docs, pageshow only fires after a page is transitioned to,
[09:31:26] <ajpiano> so it would make sense that it doesn't happen for the initial page
[09:31:29] <andrew9183> thanks ill take a look
[09:31:32] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure there is a .scrollTo()
[09:31:35] <Eviltwin> At least not natively
[09:32:06] <jwm> it is
[09:32:11] <ajpiano> jwm, when someone has a specific question about something in jquery mobile, "i don't believe in separate libraries for this sort of thing" is not an answer
[09:32:13] <Eviltwin> ?.scrollTo
[09:32:15] <bot-t> Eviltwin, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[09:32:16] <ajpiano> scrollTo is a plugin
[09:32:27] <ajpiano> it probably returns a jquery object...
[09:32:31] <ajpiano> if it doesn't, it should
[09:32:35] <hdon> ajpiano: i thought it was saying that at first, too, but it also says this about the argument to the pageshow event handlers: "A jQuery collection object that contains the page DOM element that we just transitioned away from. Note that this collection is empty when the first page is transitioned in during application startup."
[09:32:39] <Pallet> hi there, what's the console something function that outputs to Firebug ?
[09:32:52] <ajpiano> console.log("wat");
[09:32:57] <jwm> ajpiano: I didn't say that at first
[09:33:00] <jwm> ajpiano: I tried helping
[09:33:00] <ajpiano> hdon: which version of jqm are you using
[09:33:12] <Pallet> .log bugger, I was trying _log ;)
[09:33:23] <hdon> ajpiano: 1.02b
[09:33:32] <ajpiano> hdon: why not update to the latest RC ?
[09:33:35] <fatguylaughing> So I've got like 5 lines of code and can't get it to work. http://pastebin.com/HHzEBiyX Don't think I'm using the toggleClass() correctly even though it seems to be pretty simple.
[09:33:53] <hdon> ajpiano: perhaps i can make that case, unfortunately i am not the decider atm
[09:33:54] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I don't think ScrollTo uses the animation queue though
[09:34:16] <jwm> tomasm-: try do visibility: hidden instead of hide if you want to use scrollTo
[09:34:22] <ajpiano> hdon: i'm not sure why "the decider" would decide to stay on a beta when a final release candidate of the same exact platform is available
[09:34:22] <thinkt4nk> fatguylaughing > you don't have more than one element with that id, do you?
[09:34:32] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: Nope
[09:34:39] <hdon> ajpiano: tell me about it
[09:34:44] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:34:49] <ajpiano> i was about to say
[09:34:52] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: Starting to think I shouldn't be using .click?
[09:35:09] <hdon> thinkt4nk: sean?
[09:35:11] <ajpiano> one thing that i am not genuinely suprised by any more is "management staying sentimentally attached to arbitrary jquery releases"
[09:35:16] <thinkt4nk> are you making any ajax calls?
[09:35:24] <thinkt4nk> hdon: nerp
[09:35:33] <hdon> thinkt4nk: my mistake
[09:35:47] <thinkt4nk> hdon: you know someone else that uses this handle?
[09:36:13] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: ajax me?
[09:36:17] <thinkt4nk> yeah
[09:36:20] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: I'm not making any calls no
[09:36:31] <thinkt4nk> nothing wrong with .click()
[09:36:36] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: That is all the code I've got for that page.
[09:36:38] <thinkt4nk> is the handler firing?
[09:36:51] <Pallet> me again
[09:36:57] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: Not sure how to tell. New to JQuery
[09:36:57] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/BEhu4/
[09:37:00] <hdon> thinkt4nk: yup
[09:37:00] <mrryanjohnston_> Hm. Is there anyway to apply something like a .css() style if the div is only added later to the page?
[09:37:02] <Eviltwin> .toggleClass example
[09:37:10] <Eviltwin> For fatguylaughing
[09:37:22] <fatguylaughing> thinkt4nk: I know that the .click function with a removeClass worked.
[09:37:32] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: Thanks I'll take a look.
[09:37:35] <thinkt4nk> hdon: that sucks, I've used this handle since about '96, was published in 2600 with this handle
[09:37:40] <jwm> mrryanjohnston_: create a class and apply it
[09:38:12] <hdon> thinkt4nk: :D :D :D
[09:38:24] <Pallet> I'm doing jQuery("#step_two").load("/components/tmpl/step2_"+getSelectedValue("sample")+".php");  which is loading script into a DIV, however it's a wizard type page, and before I load it, how can I make sure #step_two is empty
[09:38:38] <hdon> thinkt4nk: i will present him this ultimatum: show me that you have been in 2600 or you must give up the handle
[09:39:15] <thinkt4nk> hdon: mmhmm
[09:39:31] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: By default I have the hide class already on the div.
[09:39:46] <Pallet> anyone ?
[09:39:49] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: http://jsfiddle.net/BEhu4/1/
[09:39:52] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: It needs to start out as hidden and then show when clicked and then hide again when clicked the second time.
[09:40:28] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: Ok well based off of what you put up there I don't see a difference in my code.
[09:40:30] <fatguylaughing> :(
[09:40:31] <Pallet> I need to do some sort of  jQuery("#step_two").empty
[09:41:52] <phlp> Pallet: did you even try or attempt to look it up? .empty() works
[09:42:03] <Symbi0nt> is there a channel for sproutcore?
[09:42:31] <Pallet> phlp yeh I did, but empty() isn't working, thats why I asked
[09:42:32] <Pallet> ;)
[09:42:35] <thinkt4nk> Symbi0nt #sproutcore?
[09:42:55] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: If you have Firebug or something, check that those selectors are actually selecting what you want them to
[09:43:04] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: They are...
[09:43:15] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: I looked at that first thing.
[09:43:32] <phlp> Pallet: jQuery("#step_two").empty().load("...")
[09:43:55] <jwm> fatguylaughing: your problem is that you have a separate hide class
[09:43:57] <Eviltwin> Also remember that $(".foo").click(...) will only bind to the elements that have the class "foo" when that code runs
[09:44:08] <jwm> so  you need to remove the hide class and add the show class and vice versa
[09:44:32] <Pallet> phlp, I owe you a beer, I didn't know you could stack functions like that
[09:44:33] <fatguylaughing> jwm: Don't see why. If I remove the class the it will default back to display: block;
[09:44:39] <Pallet> thanks dude
[09:44:53] <jwm> you an just use toggle for that though
[09:45:03] <jwm> .toggle()
[09:45:13] <Eviltwin> ?.toggle @ fatguylaughing
[09:45:14] <bot-t> fatguylaughing, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[09:46:28] <fatguylaughing> Thanks i'll give that a shot guys
[09:52:34] <black_warlock> guys help i need to change an attribute
[09:52:42] <black_warlock> with the location.href
[09:53:38] <black_warlock> exemple i have an input field with id="link" and name="the actual path" when the page open the attr must be changed
[09:54:02] <black_warlock> with the actual location.href
[09:59:17] <scar2> this website has a slider that does a "sleekslide" effect, as if its running away. How can this affect be replicated? Is it a "effect" ? http://www.kriesi.at/demos/?wptheme=SleekSlide
[10:01:06] <Pallet> next question, I've got the following code <span id="selectedcountry">UK</span> and I need to read the UK, ie the HTML am I on the right track   console.log(jQuery("#selectedcountry").val());
[10:01:15] <Pallet> I know that's not correct,
[10:01:55] <Pallet> I've tried .html too
[10:02:00] <phlp> scar2: did you look at the code? http://www.kriesi.at/demos/wp-content/themes/sleekslide/js/custom.js?ver=1.2.6
[10:02:02] <Pallet> but that's not working either
[10:02:16] <phlp> scar2: kriesi_sleekslide()
[10:02:32] <Pallet> Got it,
[10:02:33] <Pallet> thanks
[10:04:15] <fatguylaughing> jwm: You were right before that there was another class called hide. It was introduced by someone else's module that I have enabled.
[10:04:24] <scar2> phlp: so i can use that function as an effect to move things
[10:04:25] <scar2> ?
[10:04:29] <fatguylaughing> jwm: Doing the toggleClass works great.
[10:06:14] <phlp> scar2: well the code isn't very reusable but you can clearly see how it was done
[10:06:51] <mah> Hi. I need something like "ui-state-error" but more like a  "check" state with green check icon. How can i do it with jqueryui? Is it possible? Im using Redmond theme.
[10:11:47] <stevecrozz> if I dispatch an event I created with document.dispatchEvent()... and jQuery handles it with a $(document).bind(), the event object is totally different in the event handler, why?
[10:12:21] <stevecrozz> its missing properties that I set on the original event object (created with document.createEvent)
[10:13:00] <pts\3> $.ajax wont send post variables... it worked this morning, now this minimal test case wont even work. http://pastie.org/2873498
[10:13:04] <clir-in> hi! im using $.post() in my two <select>. i am having trouble with this scenario. i pick option 1 from <select 1> then supposed the options in <select 2> should change. but before it was change i change my mind then change to option 2. the problem is sometimes the options in <select 2> is from option 1 from <select 1>.. please help me.
[10:13:33] <pts\3> in check.php, i just have print_r($_POST); .. it shows an empty array. print_r($_POST['debug']) says invalid fofset
[10:15:04] <stevecrozz> ah ha!, i can call event.originalEvent in my handler to get the real event, and its properties are there for me to use
[10:15:55] <pts\3> why is jquery eating my data: values?
[10:16:38] <mah> Hi. I need something like "ui-state-error" but more like a  "check" state with green check icon. How can i do it with jqueryui? Is it possible? Im using Redmond theme
[10:21:44] <BarryCarlyon_> mah: use it as a base and just add additional rules thru CSS.
[10:22:53] <kanzie> how come if I push two objects into an array I still have length: 0 though I can see the properties in the inspector when Im debugging?
[10:23:54] <takahiro> how do i run a named function that is normally bound to an event against a specific element?
[10:23:55] <pts\3> why isnt ajax passing my variables? it returns success and stuff :(
[10:25:02] <BCarlyon> pts\3: you on about return from or sending to other script?
[10:25:22] <BCarlyon> Depeding on your call and what gets returned you may need to parse/process the response.
[10:25:57] <pts\3> it submits the form and all variables in the form, but ignores what i put in the data: parameter of my .ajax call
[10:26:20] <pts\3> it should send those to $_POST too right?
[10:26:51] <BCarlyon> Only if you tell it is a post request.
[10:26:55] <pts\3> i do
[10:27:06] <BCarlyon> Pastebin/jsfiddle your code
[10:27:18] <pts\3> i did above, lemme find link agai
[10:27:28] <clir-in> im sorry i dc..
[10:27:34] <pts\3> $.ajax wont send post variables... it worked this morning, now this minimal test case wont even work. http://pastie.org/2873498
[10:27:36] <clir-in> did anyone answer my q?
[10:27:44] <clir-in> hi! im using $.post() in my two <select>. i am having trouble with this scenario. i pick option 1 from <select 1> then supposed the options in <select 2> should change. but before it was change i change my mind then change to option 2. the problem is sometimes the options in <select 2> is from option 1 from <select 1>.. please help me.
[10:28:57] <stevecrozz> clir-in: you should post an example on jsfiddle, i have no idea what you're talking about
[10:30:08] <pts\3> i dont get how my code was working this morning and now magically it isnt
[10:30:23] <BCarlyon> pts\3: you should be getting post data yes. Is there any redirecting at all, I've had problems of late where a redirect from http to https is dropping my post data for example.
[10:30:27] <clir-in> ok. stevecrozz i will do a sample in jsfiddle
[10:30:30] <pts\3> no
[10:30:40] <pts\3> both are just http on my local machine
[10:31:06] <pts\3> check.php is just oneline  print_r($_POST);
[10:31:17] <BCarlyon> also debug='lalala' is a bit messy, it might be that. do a var_dump of $_REQUEST in your check.php script to see if its passing as GET instead. for some reason
[10:31:59] <BCarlyon> By messy I mean its got ' in
[10:32:03] <takahiro> can i run a function on an object? http://jsfiddle.net/rBxgq/
[10:32:22] <pts\3> i changed it to 4
[10:32:25] <BCarlyon> pts\3: print_r($_POST) will work fine, should result in a success but your do nothing with the returned data other than alert
[10:32:28] <pts\3> now  "debug=4",
[10:32:42] <pts\3> BCarlyon: it returns an empty array
[10:32:54] <supsup> sup
[10:32:57] <BCarlyon> pts\3: your code on success fires an alert and does nothing.
[10:33:37] <pts\3> i have return true so it follows the action and loads the page check.php
[10:33:55] <pts\3> and that page shows me an empty array of $_POST but actually
[10:34:02] <pts\3> that success thing doesnt fire
[10:34:40] <BCarlyon> Post full code form an all then.
[10:34:53] <xckpd7> how do people develop large jQuery applications? Let's say the site is 1,000 pages and you have 1 page with 1 widget: does the javascript for that widget apply to the whole site or just that one page?
[10:35:10] <xkogex> Go on www.otakustate.com Game, Anime and Manga News and Reviews!
[10:35:11] <BCarlyon> pts\3: you also need this to stop the form submitting and fire the js without going elsewhere: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:35:15] <xckpd7> really struggling with jQuery design right now...
[10:35:47] <pts\3> i want to follow for debugging purposes
[10:36:05] <BCarlyon> pts\3: if you let the form submit normally then the javascript doesn't fire.
[10:36:05] <pts\3> i will turn it off after i can see that it is sending the proper information
[10:36:10] <pts\3> oh
[10:36:13] <BCarlyon> Do this
[10:36:21] <BCarlyon> echo json_encode($_POST);
[10:36:23] <BCarlyon> in your check.php
[10:36:34] <BCarlyon> then alert on console.log the data in your success function
[10:36:54] <BCarlyon> But include the prevent default
[10:37:26] <BCarlyon> xckpd7: I think you approaching it from the wrong angle design wise.
[10:37:48] <BCarlyon> Might be easier xckpd7 to build it and make it work without jQuery and then build in the jQuery elements you need.
[10:38:21] <pts\3> wow
[10:38:30] <BCarlyon> hmm pts\3 ?
[10:38:56] <djQuery> Is there anyway to scale something to the size of the monitor in inches? I want to do a canvas draving that can be printed out and used as a template
[10:38:58] <pts\3> im too retarded. BCarlyon i didnt know return true prevented the javascript from firing. i thought it fired and followed to the action
[10:39:51] <BCarlyon> pts\3: return true means the form submits return false stops the form submitting. But since you are relying on a ajax call use prevent default. As the ajax call can be in progress and not finished.
[10:39:56] <BCarlyon> Becuase the form submits.
[10:40:05] <pts\3> i see
[10:40:09] <pts\3> i sure learned my lesson
[10:40:35] <BCarlyon> :-D
[10:41:21] <djQuery> $('form').submit(funciton(e){ e.preventDefault();   })
[10:41:42] <djQuery> ?preventdefault@pts\3
[10:41:42] <bot-t> pts\3, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:41:59] <andrew9183> hey guys, what does the && do ?, e.g. return(id&&settings[id])
[10:42:15] <Eviltwin> && means and
[10:42:33] <joshsmith> what's the best way for detecting keypress in an input?
[10:42:37] <djQuery> id has a value and settings[id] has a value
[10:42:40] <joshsmith> keyup, keydown, keypress?
[10:42:42] <andrew9183> hmm
[10:42:46] <BCarlyon> Looks like return true if id and settions[id] has a value else false
[10:42:51] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Probably keypress
[10:43:02] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: I think for things like repeated keys, keypress gets repeated
[10:43:14] <djQuery> ?g javascript comparision operators@ Andrew9183

[10:43:16] <BCarlyon> joshsmith: all three but make sure you only fire the detector on one.
[10:43:43] <BCarlyon> joshsmith: I usually use keyup tho.
[10:44:21] <djQuery> pts\3: also if you dont want to have to write the ajax submision part of the code your self see ?ajaxform

[10:44:57] <IQuitSmokingToda> Problem is, I'm not sure what event to use to know when the user clicks off my menu.
[10:45:05] <pts\3> thanks for the info
[10:45:35] <djQuery> IQuitSmokingToda: I can't code without a smoke. are you looking for blur
[10:45:35] * IQuitSmokingToda doesn't need to smoke when he has smoking hot Madonna pics to stare at.
[10:45:52] <BCarlyon> o.0
[10:45:54] <IQuitSmokingToda> djQuery: Blur doesn't seem to be working on my div :/
[10:46:12] <IQuitSmokingToda> djQuery: Unless blur is specific to jQuery?
[10:46:31] <djQuery> IQuitSmokingToda: no its not
[10:46:56] <djQuery> one of the regulars wrote something just for this that lets you know when something other that X was clicked on.
[10:48:41] <IQuitSmokingToda> dhruvasagar: Hmm
[10:49:22] <IQuitSmokingToda> djQuery: blur seems to work only after focus (which makes sense), but also only seems to work on textareas, no tdivs.

[10:50:53] <Chetic> anybody have tips on how to let one form be in the middle of another? no interaction, just <form><inputs><form></form><more inputs></form>
[10:51:21] <snover> it’s impossible.
[10:51:32] <Aamir> Chetic:  not valid
[10:51:47] <djQuery> $(document).on('click', '.modalshowing', function(){  if(!$(this).is('.activeElement')) $('.activeEleement').removeClass('activeElement'); $('body').removeClass('modalshowing;); })
[10:51:55] <djQuery> IQuitSmokingToda: ^^^^^^
[10:51:56] <snover> eventually html5 will, in theory, allow form elements to refer to alternate forms but it isn’t available everywhere
[10:52:44] <Chetic> so there's no hacky way to put one form within another?
[10:52:49] <IQuitSmokingToda> djQuery: Checking it out :p
[10:52:52] <Chetic> and still let it be valid html
[10:53:01] <Aamir> Chetic:  no
[10:53:05] <IQuitSmokingToda> Chetic: Why do you need to?
[10:53:14] <djQuery> IQuitSmokingToda: probably need to use hasClass instead of is
[10:53:16] <Aamir> Chetic:  or use iframe in a form :D kidding
[10:53:31] <Chetic> IQuitSmokingToda: <form><inputs><form></form><more inputs></form>
[10:53:42] <djQuery> dang its being laggy tocay
[10:53:43] <Chetic> no interactions between the forms, just one in the middle of anohter
[10:53:49] <IQuitSmokingToda> Is .on similar to .bind()?
[10:53:54] <blindMoe> IQuitSmokingToda: you just reminded me.. time for a smoke
[10:54:02] <Chetic> lol
[10:54:34] * IQuitSmokingToda gives blindMoe what's left of his Cools pack from this morning.
[10:55:06] <kategeek> Chetic: do they need to have different actions? Why do you want them nested?
[10:55:09] <IQuitSmokingToda> Chetic: Why do you need to? Just use a div inside the form to contain the other inputs.
[10:55:23] <djQuery> fieldset?
[10:56:38] <Chetic> IQuitSmokingToda: and treat that div as it's own form?
[10:57:18] <Chetic> kategeek: yeah different actions.. like I said <form><inputs><form></form><more inputs></form>
[10:57:44] <Chetic> <inputs> and <more inputs> belong to the top form

[10:58:30] <clir-in> please help
[10:58:41] <Chetic> IQuitSmokingToda: I want both forms to be full-fledged forms, but one in the middle of the other
[10:58:47] <b0ot> Could someone explain this to me: http://paste2.org/p/1780754 I don't get how you can call sayHello() by itself
[10:58:49] <Chetic> no interaction
[10:58:53] <djQuery> clir-in: looks fine to me
[10:59:43] <djQuery> Chetic: then use  negative positions in CSS make it appear that the form is in the middle of the other when its not actualy?
[11:00:25] <IQuitSmokingToda> djQuery: =<
[11:00:34] <kategeek> would having a submit button with a different value so your backend knows which "form" was submitted
[11:00:51] <clir-in> djquery: try to change the value of #test1 the the alert(1) didnt work
[11:01:05] <Chetic> ok should I just say fu to my boss, and that nested forms is a stupid idea?
[11:01:12] <Chetic> see I don't like it either
[11:01:16] <kategeek> Chetic: yes
[11:01:21] <Eviltwin> b0ot: What don't you understand?
[11:01:29] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do?
[11:02:09] <b0ot> Eviltwin, just learning trying to learn jquery from the http://jqfundamentals.com site
[11:02:19] <kategeek> Chetic: if it is just for looks then use css
[11:02:30] <b0ot> Eviltwin, I don't get how that var is being set.
[11:03:22] <judaz> hello, I need some help using 2 different versions of jquery at the same time with a tweek
[11:03:25] <Eviltwin> b0ot: You probably need to start by learning JavaScript: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:03:26] <b0ot> Eviltwin, sayHello() seems to be defined under myName... how can you access it directly outside the var definition?
[11:03:30] <Chetic> kategeek: thanks
[11:03:32] <judaz> I've read this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-remove-jquery-version-conflict
[11:03:36] <judaz> but..
[11:04:03] <rroelofs> bOot:  it is not.  the indentation lies
[11:04:23] <judaz> I'm developing a piece of code that is executed on someone else's site. That site has some stuff written on jquery, and even some extensions are working there
[11:04:34] <rroelofs> well, sort ove  it is there to indicate that the line continues from above
[11:05:22] <djQuery> so your trying to change wht ath post is going to then you need to use .ajax instead of .post.
[11:05:27] <judaz> i need to use a specific version of jquery, but it's executed AFTER the whole site (on demand). How can I avoid to redefine the jQuery variable for the original site?
[11:06:09] <djQuery> and jsfiddle is not going to be able to do a post to drop box is it?
[11:06:21] <Snerf> using .draggable/.droppable on a tablet does not work, is there somekind of a module I can use to implement this?
[11:06:21] <abstrakt> ok so I can validate a normal "form"
[11:06:23] <abstrakt> like this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/email
[11:06:27] <abstrakt> but how would I just validate a string?
[11:06:37] <abstrakt> say, some kind of arbitrary input that doesn't come from a form
[11:06:45] <abstrakt> say the string came from an Ajax response for example
[11:06:51] <abstrakt> or a datastore or something
[11:07:07] <abstrakt> or .innerHtml for example
[11:07:10] <Eviltwin> validate according to what requirements?
[11:07:11] <djQuery> create a regex that resprents the string and then do a comparision
[11:07:26] <djQuery> ?regex
[11:07:27] <bot-t> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I'll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.

[11:09:32] <b0ot> Eviltwin, what does it mean when you use a comma after a var
[11:09:54] <b0ot> ie var foo = 'Firefly', ...
[11:10:11] <Eviltwin> var a = "x", b = "y"; means the same thing as var a = "x"; var b = "y";
[11:10:29] <IQuitSmokingToda> How difficult would it be to modify jQuery to add a 'clickoff' event? So I can do $(mydiv).bind('clickoff', function() { });
[11:10:39] <xckpd7> can someone give an explanation as to the benefits of using jQuery Templates? I'm watching some screencasts but still don't get the huge benefit over just concatenating
[11:10:41] <Eviltwin> IQuitSmokingToda: What do you mean by click off?
[11:11:09] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I think it takes care of some escaping for you
[11:11:13] <Eviltwin> And also lets you do some loops
[11:11:22] <IQuitSmokingToda> Eviltwin: When the user clicks off a div
[11:11:24] <Eviltwin> Like repeating a block for each element in an object
[11:11:29] <Eviltwin> IQuitSmokingToda: Define what you mean by that
[11:11:30] <b0ot> Eviltwin, that makes sooooooooo much more sense
[11:11:31] <IQuitSmokingToda> Eviltwin: Kind of like 'blur'
[11:11:45] <IQuitSmokingToda> Eviltwin: But for divs (I can't get 'blur' working on divs)
[11:11:45] <Eviltwin> b0ot: First form is actually faster
[11:12:00] <Eviltwin> IQuitSmokingToda: divs don't have focus so I'm not sure how you intend to do this
[11:12:06] <ajpiano> IQuitSmokingToda: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[11:12:09] <Eviltwin> Do you mean they've clicked inside a div and now they've clicked outside the div?
[11:12:50] <fission6> what tag do you use for a place holder, like if you plan on populating content for like a persons name. <span id="persons_name"></span> or do you use a div or osmething else?
[11:13:09] <b0ot> so it's something like int x=2,y=3,z=4; just saving you from having to type var all the time
[11:13:38] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Except in JavaScript it actually takes less compilation time too
[11:13:54] <b0ot> btw the example from the book didn't work for me: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/#example-2.41 I get a console message saying sayHello.bind is not a function
[11:14:00] <Eviltwin> Just like in C, the comma can be used for other things too
[11:14:14] <Eviltwin> b0ot: To do .bind you need to use Opera or Firefox, I think
[11:14:15] <Eviltwin> Or maybe Chrome
[11:14:20] <Eviltwin> Safari won't work, IE won't work
[11:14:25] <IQuitSmokingToda> Eviltwin: I will fake it
[11:14:26] <Eviltwin> And older versions of any of those browsers won't work either
[11:14:34] <Eviltwin> I suggest not using it
[11:14:35] <IQuitSmokingToda> ajpiano: Ah, cool
[11:14:45] <b0ot> alright
[11:14:45] <b0ot> thanks
[11:15:00] <IQuitSmokingToda> Omg, 'clickoutside'!!!
[11:15:03] <Eviltwin> You could also use $.proxy to do the same thing with a slightly different syntax
[11:15:05] <IQuitSmokingToda> Thanks ajpiano :)
[11:15:17] <ajpiano> :D
[11:15:26] <ajpiano> thank ben_alman_
[11:15:28] <Eviltwin> b0ot: $.proxy(function,object) will yield effectively the same thing as function.bind(object)

[11:26:53] <Faerris> Any of you know how to add an H2 tag around the clickable link in a UI Tabs-based page?
[11:26:59] <joshsmith> I'm binding a submit and submitting something to an async JS API, and the submit happens too quickly for both calls to be made
[11:26:59] <beefman> sorry, nix the second question mark
[11:27:02] <Eviltwin> beefman: You need to have two images and fade the new one in
[11:27:04] <joshsmith> it will make one, but not the other
[11:27:22] <beefman> eviltwin: ty
[11:27:28] <joshsmith> does anyone have any suggestions on whether I should be setting a timeout and then submitting, or some other less hacky technique
[11:27:29] <Eviltwin> Faerris: Sounds like you may want to just style the links
[11:28:01] <djQuery> beefman: bind to the load event then hide it and change the source.  in the load event show it again?
[11:28:01] <stevecrozz> clir-in: your $.post request is not successful, so it doesn't call back to your success handler
[11:28:10] <Faerris> Eviltwin: This is what I need to do: http://pastie.org/2873841
[11:28:15] <stevecrozz> it would call back to your error handler if you had one
[11:28:20] <Faerris> Eviltwin: It's for SEO purposes

[11:31:10] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Can you see what's happening there?
[11:31:42] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: What do you mean by backwards compatibility?
[11:31:47] <xckpd7> as far as theming buttons but reserving images for IE
[11:31:52] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: ah, yeah. unfortunately this is not using jQuery's ajax()
[11:31:59] <joshsmith> let me show you what I mean

[11:34:23] <djQuery> GoSox: click on the jslint button in you fiddle

[11:35:27] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Is there a nice API spec somewhere for that?
[11:35:47] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Also kind of important that you include jQuery when you want to use jQuery in a jsFiddle :P

[11:39:43] <GoSox> Eviltwin
[11:39:46] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: This API doesn't seem very JavaScript friendly
[11:39:47] <labratt> GoSox what rate you trying to do alert the user when they are done typing
[11:39:57] <labratt> are
[11:40:07] <GoSox> what?
[11:40:37] <labratt> in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sDA8Z/
[11:40:44] <labratt> what are you trying to do
[11:41:01] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Not sure there's a solution for this, sorry
[11:41:01] <GoSox> get "anything" to happen, because nothing was working, which was due to a missing
[11:41:05] <GoSox> ");"
[11:41:48] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I think I might have found it
[11:42:03] <albertosh> is using live slower than bind?
[11:42:11] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: it's using _kmq.push(['trackSubmit', 'form-id', 'My Event'])
[11:42:14] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Depends
[11:42:20] <Eviltwin> albertosh: But generally not
[11:42:21] <joshsmith> albertosh: probably
[11:42:22] <albertosh> Eviltwin: in?
[11:42:40] <Eviltwin> Actually, .live is bad
[11:42:41] <Eviltwin> Don't use it
[11:42:45] <albertosh> ok
[11:42:49] <Eviltwin> Use .on or .delegate
[11:42:57] <Eviltwin> Those are fast
[11:43:02] <albertosh> ok!
[11:43:22] <albertosh> Eviltwin: and i can assign them even before the element exists?
[11:43:27] <Eviltwin> If the collection is dynamic or there are more than 3 elements you want to bind the same listener to, use .on or .delegate
[11:43:32] <albertosh> Eviltwin: like i do with live
[11:43:42] <Eviltwin> So .live is kind of silly
[11:44:07] <Eviltwin> Let's say you're doing $("a").live("click",function(){...})
[11:44:11] <albertosh> Eviltwin: how do i remove an .on delegate?
[11:44:32] <Eviltwin> First it builds a collection of all A tags currently in the page
[11:44:49] <albertosh> ok go on
[11:44:52] <Eviltwin> Then throws it out and does $(document).bind("click","a",function(){...})
[11:44:53] <djQuery> albertosh: off
[11:45:00] <djQuery> albertosh: see ?off
[11:45:03] <albertosh> ok
[11:45:04] <bot-t> albertosh, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[11:45:08] <albertosh> thanks! will try
[11:45:17] <Eviltwin> Sorry $(document).on("click","a",function(){...})
[11:45:21] <Eviltwin> Not .bind
[11:45:35] <Eviltwin> Anything you .on you can symmetrically .off
[11:46:01] <albertosh> Eviltwin: there is no on / off on jquery 1.6 though right?
[11:46:25] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Right, so use .delegate
[11:46:37] <Eviltwin> Which has .undelegate
[11:47:35] <djQuery> albertosh: byt the way just doit wityhout needing an off     $(document).on('click', 'a:not(.disabled)', function(){})
[11:48:10] <scar2> Are there any effects similar to this effect on sleekslide (www.boastingbiz.com/testing.html -- seen by clikcing view next project)?
[11:48:18] <scar2> or anyone recommend custom jquery slider effects?
[11:48:28] <Eviltwin> djQuery: I'm not sure albertosh's even trying to do anything with A tags
[11:48:31] <Eviltwin> I just picked at random
[11:48:43] <djQuery> Eviltwin: same here
[11:49:22] <Eviltwin> scar2: You definitely have access to the pieces to be able to build that
[11:49:27] <Eviltwin> scar2: But you're going to have to build it
[11:49:27] <djQuery> the point is add the .diabled class to an <a> and the click defined in the on will no longer apply to it
[11:51:32] <djQuery> scar2: werent you asking this earlier? just under a different name?
[11:52:21] <scar2> djQuery: same name
[11:52:33] <djQuery> $(
[11:54:38] <djQuery> $('slider').on('click', 'button.next', function(){   $(this).closest('slidepanel').toggle('slide').next().toggle('slide');  });
[11:54:52] <djQuery> scar2: ^^^
[11:56:03] <scar2> is that in conjunction with the code i had on the example or is this separate?
[11:56:15] <djQuery> scar2: simple enough?
[11:56:35] <scar2> im not just looking for a solution, im looking at how to figure out wtf. i know it cant be THAT hard to create divs that have triggers and easein/out with elasstic bouncing or somethingu know? heck i dunno. im a php guy
[11:56:53] <djQuery> scar2: no thats pretty complete as long as you finger out where I missed a .
[11:57:25] <albertosh> Eviltwin: thanks man, will try the .delegate
[11:58:21] <GoSox> if I wanted a function to run on load, and also every time someone enters data into a text area, is this the proper way to call that function?
[11:58:22] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/dVEyc/
[11:58:24] <scar2> djQuery: but does it have the same effect as www.boastingbiz.com/testing.html ?? (when u click view next project it does the effect)-- however, if i take that "slider" out of that design, there is no bug (the bug, on that url is that all the slides are visible and the horizontal scrollbar is showing to scroll to them)
[11:58:53] <Eviltwin> GoSox: You could also just do $("...").keyup(flip);
[11:59:00] <Eviltwin> If you don't care about the arguments
[11:59:10] <GoSox> well i was going to add more to that
[11:59:18] <GoSox> but right now, the keyup flip isn't being called at all
[11:59:27] <djQuery> scar2: not quite both of mine slide at the same time
[11:59:33] <dp> can anyone point me to a way, using JS/jQuery, to determine if a flash file used in an <object/> tag is actually displaying on the page?
[11:59:41] <b0ot> Eviltwin, what is the purpose of .data ?
[11:59:50] <Eviltwin> b0ot: In what context?
[11:59:52] <djQuery> instead of waiting for 1 to finish before starting the next
[12:00:03] <Eviltwin> Like $(...).data() ?
[12:00:13] <supsup> did the room bot become self-aware?
[12:00:23] <b0ot> $('#myDiv').data...
[12:00:25] <scar2> djQuery: what effect is the effect its using on the url i gave?
[12:00:25] <Eviltwin> supsup: You can pull its strings from outside
[12:00:30] <b0ot> yes
[12:00:43] <Eviltwin> b0ot: It allows to associate arbitrary data with the element
[12:00:58] <Eviltwin> That you can access at a later time
[12:00:58] <djQuery> for that to happen you would just need to put $('slider').on('click', 'button.next', function(){   var sliding = $(this).closest('slidepanel').toggle('slide', function(){ sliding.next().toggle('slide'); }) });
[12:01:16] <Eviltwin> It's also how widgets keep track of internal data
[12:01:17] <b0ot> Eviltwin, can that arb data be from elsewhere?
[12:01:25] <Eviltwin> What do you mean?
[12:01:34] <dp> nm, I found a workaround
[12:01:38] <joshsmith> how do I trigger a submit?
[12:01:40] <djQuery> scar2: dunno head over to jqueryui and look at the different easing to find one like thiers
[12:01:41] <b0ot> if I have a var x = 23;
[12:01:45] <joshsmith> $('#form').trigger('submit')?
[12:01:46] <Eviltwin> Hellojere: .submit() or .trigger("submit")
[12:02:12] <b0ot> $('#myDiv').data(x) or something
[12:02:20] <supsup> or u could do it ghetto fab way of doing a click on a input submit!
[12:02:27] <Eviltwin> You mean you want to store the value of x with that element?
[12:02:37] <scar2> djQuery: if i know which easing to use, how do i incorporate it? man i  thought i had this down but now i feel like i have no idea what im doing hahaa
[12:02:38] <b0ot> in the data element
[12:02:40] <djQuery> scar2: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/easing.html
[12:03:08] <Eviltwin> b0ot: $("#myDiv").data("x",23); $("#myDiv").data("x") === 23
[12:03:26] <djQuery> scar2: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/quick-tip-add-easing-to-your-animations
[12:03:54] <supsup> i hate animations
[12:04:17] <Ezek2k4> i have inputs that are created dynamically and i would like to add autocomplete to them what would be the best solution?
[12:04:18] <Ezek2k4> append?
[12:04:20] <GoSox> Eviltwin: my flip(); call prevents the .keyup(flip); from running. But if I comment out the flip(); call, the keyup one runs as expected
[12:04:22] <supsup> anti-animite?
[12:04:56] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Then your flip is probably causing an error
[12:05:27] <b0ot> is data just an array o arb info?
[12:05:30] <kategeek> GoSox: do you know how to view js errors?
[12:05:43] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Object (key-value pairs)
[12:05:55] <b0ot> well an array is an object
[12:06:01] <b0ot> in js right?
[12:06:16] <Eviltwin> Every array is an object. Not every object is an array
[12:06:23] <djQuery> Ezek2k4: $('form').on('focus', 'input.autoc', fucntion(){ $(this).removeClass('autoc').autocomplate(put options here); })
[12:06:31] <Eviltwin> So while it can be an array, it doesn't have to be
[12:06:38] <b0ot> hmm
[12:06:40] <b0ot> ok
[12:06:51] <scar2> djQuery: You know, at the url www.boastingbiz.com/testing.html -- do you see the horizontal scrollbar and how the other slides are visible by scrolling? how do i sstop that?
[12:07:34] <djQuery> scar2: using chrome dev I dont
[12:07:39] <djQuery> devb build htat is
[12:07:44] <jwmann> I'm really not sure if this is my jQuery coding or if it's drupal 7's specific jquery stuff. The function IS being called but the click isn't do shit. Anybody know why? http://d.pr/9Zy
[12:08:08] <scar2> djQuery: can you check another browser? i have checked ALL and i see the horizontal scrollbar for the entire page
[12:09:25] <djQuery> scar2: hmmmm when I use ie I get this Content on this website has been reported as unsafe
[12:09:34] <djQuery> lookaround.ns02.bizlookaround.ns02.biz
[12:09:56] <djQuery> so no I cant use a different browser
[12:10:26] <datlap> i have a boolean field available (yes,no) when i list it  i want to replace yes with an icon yes and no with an icon no. what is the best way to do this?
[12:10:46] <Eviltwin> datlap: ?
[12:10:53] <Eviltwin> Oh, who was in here about H2s for SEO?
[12:11:08] <scar2> really? hmm
[12:11:25] <riyonuk> I'm trying to grab an elements height + margin, and both height() and outerHeight are the same. :(
[12:11:26] <Eviltwin> Faerris?
[12:12:18] <kborchers> scar2: i also get that warning in IE9 and do not see other slides/horizontal scroll in Chrome stable nor FF8
[12:12:23] <kategeek> riyonuk: outerHeight(true) ?
[12:12:37] <riyonuk> hurr durr im retarded
[12:12:40] <riyonuk> thanks!
[12:12:40] <riyonuk> XD
[12:13:13] <Faerris> Hi Eviltwin
[12:13:23] <Eviltwin> Faerris: Search engines don't run JavaScript
[12:13:33] <djQuery> scar2: what browser are you using?
[12:13:45] <Eviltwin> Faerris: So those H2s won't be there when they index
[12:13:58] <Faerris> ah darn really?
[12:14:01] <Eviltwin> Yup
[12:14:17] <GoSox> whats the proper event to use to act when a checkbox's state is changed?
[12:14:23] <GoSox> either checked or unchecked
[12:15:08] <Eviltwin> GoSox: change
[12:15:20] <GoSox> easy enough
[12:15:41] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Do you ever try things on your own or just ask in here?
[12:16:44] <Faerris> Eviltwin: I almost got it working with the following: $("li a").wrap( "<h2>" ) but i need it to select a specific <li> class, and when I do $("li.ui-state-default a").wrap( "<h2>" ) it doesn't work
[12:18:15] <jwmann> I have an achor that has 2 classes 'foo' and 'foobar' and I'm trying to 'grab' foobar in order to use it with another element. How would I do that?
[12:18:20] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: $.Callbacks is definitely missing something helpful Backbone has
[12:18:49] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: I'm off to get coffee but we should talk about it when you drop by tomorrow :) maybe I'm missing something obvious
[12:19:01] <GoSox> Eviltwin: that's a funny question. see if you can glue all my questions together and make anything that functions. And if not, maybe, just maybe, i'm not informing you of everything i'm doing on my computer right now
[12:19:04] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: my thoughts exactly, im bout to dive into ACR :D
[12:19:22] <ajpiano> i'm not all that well versed in $.Callbacks, really
[12:19:41] <ajpiano> but yeah, let's discuss
[12:19:45] <Eviltwin> Faerris: http://jsfiddle.net/Cqx37/
[12:20:41] <jwmann> Sorry let me rephrase my question
[12:20:44] <jwmann> I have an anchor that has 2 classes: 'foo' and 'foo-1' and I'm trying to 'grab' 'foobar' in order to use it with another element. How would I do that? Also foo-1 could also be foo-2 and foo-3..
[12:20:49] <Faerris> thanks looking Eviltwin
[12:21:04] <Eviltwin> Seems to work fine there
[12:21:10] <jwmann> s/\'foobar\'/\'foo-1\'
[12:21:59] <kategeek> jwmann: grab? use with another element?
[12:22:06] <Faerris> Eviltwin: yeah it's odd
[12:22:12] <jutnux> So what do you al think about SOPA?
[12:22:29] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Can you make a pastebin with a few before/afters
[12:22:35] <jwmann> kategeek: Basically. I'd like to grab that specific class in order to stick it in a varible and select another element relative to that one
[12:22:39] <Faerris> Eviltwin: the second i strip out the .ui-state-default it works on the site
[12:22:55] <Eviltwin> Faerris: You sure it has that class when it's run?
[12:23:07] <Faerris> Eviltwin: yeah i'm looking at it live
[12:23:23] <Faerris> or do you mean it adds the class after the content loads?
[12:23:39] <kategeek> jwmann: var foobar = $('.foobar')
[12:23:56] <Eviltwin> Faerris: Try adding console.log($("li").map(function(){return this.className})) right before
[12:24:05] <jwmann> kategeek: I'll make a jsfiddle
[12:27:01] <Faerris> Eviltwin: got it to work :)
[12:27:25] <Faerris> $(document).ready(function () {  $('.ui-state-default a').wrap("<h2>");  });
[12:27:33] <Eviltwin> Yup
[12:27:37] <joshsmith> if I'm doing preventDefault() on a form submit, how can I then submit that form later in the script?
[12:27:57] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: I think I sent you an example of this
[12:28:19] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[12:28:55] <Eviltwin> When you do a bind, it gets passed the events
[12:29:01] <Eviltwin> But can also get passed extra data
[12:29:13] <Eviltwin> See how I do .trigger("submit",true)?
[12:29:36] <Eviltwin> That means true comes in as the second parameter to the submit handler
[12:29:57] <Eviltwin> And I have the handler return without doing anything if that's the case
[12:30:00] <jwmann> Eviltwin, kategeek: Here's my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/KYvAd/1/
[12:30:23] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I need something that will work after a timeout
[12:30:47] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Believe it or not, this is actaully after a timeout
[12:30:50] <Eviltwin> I'm faking the AJAX
[12:31:02] <Eviltwin> Scroll down in the JavaScript sction
[12:31:04] <Eviltwin> section*
[12:31:15] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: ah, I didn't see that part
[12:31:23] <Eviltwin> jwmann: What's the before and after?
[12:31:45] <jwmann> Eviltwin: I don't understand what you're asking for
[12:31:55] <Eviltwin> Actually the problem is I don't know what you're asking for :P
[12:32:00] <kategeek> jwmann: why not make foo-x the id
[12:32:08] <kategeek> or the href
[12:32:20] <jwmann> kategeek: I don't have control over that
[12:32:56] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Are you trying to get the classes? Change the classes? Remove the classes?
[12:33:31] <jwmann> Eviltwin: I'm trying to use the specific class in order to select another element
[12:35:38] <jwmann> kategeek: Actually, apparently I do have control over that. What would I perform this action if it were an ID instead?
[12:36:02] <kategeek> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/KYvAd/2/
[12:36:14] <albertosh> can i use .delegate without a selector ??
[12:36:16] <albertosh> like
[12:36:31] <albertosh> $("#mydiv").delegate("click",blah) ?
[12:36:36] <datlap> Eviltwin: i have a list item w/ yes/no value. i just want to  replace a yes value with a yes image and a no value with a no image and i m curious what is the best way to do this
[12:36:45] <kategeek> jwmann: then it would be $("div." + $(this).attr('id')).dostuff
[12:36:55] <Eviltwin> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/KYvAd/3/
[12:36:56] <jwmann> kategeek: Thank you :)
[12:37:10] <djQuery> albertosh: $(document).delegate('a', click(){})
[12:37:19] <Eviltwin> albertosh: What's your goal?
[12:37:33] <Eviltwin> What events are you trying to capture?
[12:37:52] <Eviltwin> datlap: So like <li>yes</li> and <li>no</li>?
[12:37:53] <phlp> kategeek, jwmann: "#" + $(this).attr('id')
[12:37:54] <Eviltwin> Or something like that?
[12:38:15] <kategeek> phlp, jwmann: yep
[12:38:16] <Eviltwin> phlp: That would be the element itself, no?
[12:38:18] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I'm trying this, and the submit is not triggering for me
[12:38:20] <albertosh> to bind a click into a div
[12:38:24] <albertosh> that has no children...
[12:38:26] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: jsFiddle example?
[12:38:27] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: under if(data.valid)
[12:39:16] <phlp> Eviltwin: you're right. i wasnt paying close enough attention, saw what looked like a class selector mixed with id attr
[12:39:21] <kategeek> phlp, jwmann: nope, that would me the original element
[12:39:39] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Try clicking "Foo 1" and "Foo 2": http://jsfiddle.net/KYvAd/3/
[12:40:11] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Even cooler: http://jsfiddle.net/KYvAd/4/
[12:40:17] <kategeek> jwmann: Eviltwin's solution works regardless of class order, so use that
[12:40:36] <albertosh> Eviltwin: yeah, with document works, but i dunno if it's better to bind it to the div
[12:40:42] <jwmann> That's pretty badass. Thanks :)
[12:40:59] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Specifically what events are you trying to catch and for what elements?
[12:41:03] <djQuery> phlp: how about $('#' this.id);
[12:41:11] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: not jsFiddle, but https://gist.github.com/1371080
[12:41:14] <albertosh> Eviltwin: like instead of $(document).delegate("#myDiv","click") to do $("#mydiv").delegate("click")
[12:41:46] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: line 23 there does log to the console, but the form is not actually submitting on line 24
[12:42:14] <phlp> djQuery: well i didnt know it at the time but the goal was to select a div with CLASS the same as the id of this
[12:42:25] <kborchers> ?bind @ albertosh
[12:42:26] <bot-t> albertosh, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[12:42:37] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: You sure?
[12:42:46] <Eviltwin> Add a console.log to the top of the handler
[12:42:47] <clir-in> hi. can you help me where to put the abort() in autocompleter
[12:42:49] <clir-in> http://jsfiddle.net/azorpax/wyHgL/
[12:42:51] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: oh, I am sure
[12:43:00] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: And one inside the if (!isEmail(email)) {
[12:43:04] <Chopps> hi guys, question, i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/ge9j3/ to show some content once the main page content is fully loaded, but its not working, it does hide the loading screen, but it doesnt show the content i want, anyone can tell me what im doing wrong? thanks
[12:43:08] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: to the top of what handler?
[12:43:12] <djQuery> phlp: but the get the id or value of somethign just use javascript instead of haveing to make another call to jquery  this.id == $(this).attr('id') but 100* faster
[12:43:18] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: After line 6
[12:43:19] <albertosh> Eviltwin: yeah i just didnt wanted to use bind
[12:43:27] <albertosh> but delegate...
[12:44:03] <phlp> djQuery: yes i know it was copy/paste i only changed it to # for id
[12:44:04] <Eviltwin> albertosh: If you're only acting on one element, use bind
[12:44:14] <djQuery> cool
[12:44:16] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: hmm the submit event was fired, but the form is not submitting
[12:44:19] <Ludo237> Hello :D
[12:44:33] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: I suspect the isEmail thing
[12:44:39] <Eviltwin> So add a line in there
[12:44:45] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I did. it never hits that
[12:44:47] <Eviltwin> A long line in that if statement
[12:45:09] <Eviltwin> Are there any other things binding to forms?
[12:45:16] <Eviltwin> That's my only other guess
[12:45:48] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: nope. this is a simple landing page. there shouldn't be anything else binding here
[12:46:40] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Add a console.log to the end of the submit handler
[12:46:58] <Eviltwin> Between line 30 and 31 in the gist
[12:47:08] <Eviltwin> So you know how far it gets
[12:47:17] <Chopps> omg what an idiot, i was missing # on my code
[12:47:27] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Heh, that happens
[12:47:48] <clir-in> eviltwin can you help me with autocompleter
[12:48:02] <Eviltwin> clir-in: Don't know anything about it, sorry
[12:48:14] <na3r> hi, i have an click event that has ajax requests. i want when ajax is starting. user couldent click on the link
[12:48:15] <clir-in> ok tnx
[12:48:21] <na3r> sorry for my english
[12:48:26] <na3r> and here is my code
[12:48:28] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: the first time it goes through the submit handler, it logs after the preventDefault(), but not the second time
[12:48:36] <na3r> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/508900/
[12:49:06] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Can you cram this into a jsFiddle so I can actually see it in action?
[12:49:11] <na3r> and ajaxstart function
[12:49:12] <na3r> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/508907/
[12:49:43] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I'll try to throw something together real fast (omitting the _kmq stuff)
[12:52:35] <GoSox> off topic question, what was the most popular version of windows before XP came out?
[12:53:46] <phlp> 2000?
[12:55:17] <Perel_> GoSox: Depends on what market. 2000 or 98SE for business and home respectively, XP was the first version to get both types of user on the same codebase
[12:55:31] <GoSox> i see
[12:55:40] <GoSox> ok thanks
[12:56:26] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: for whatever reason the regex isn't working in jsFiddle, though it works fine on my end
[12:56:45] <Eviltwin> Okay, well is this live in a page somwhere that I can see?
[12:57:03] <joshsmith> oh I know why
[12:57:15] <joshsmith> I had to escape an @ in the regex for ASP .NET
[12:57:51] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: jsfiddle.net/MdkWv/6
[12:58:01] <joshsmith> er, http://jsfiddle.net/MdkWv/6
[12:58:11] <joshsmith> that's working, though
[12:58:17] <joshsmith> whereas mine is most definitely not
[12:58:23] <joshsmith> let me publish and show you live
[12:58:50] <joshsmith> can I PM you, though? I can't share this publicly here
[12:58:56] <Eviltwin> Sure
[13:01:21] <magic_hat> hi all. i'm trying to write a function that monitors a series of text inputs for change, and then inserts their values lower down in the document. I'm getting TypeError "HTMLInputElement> has no method 'change'". here's the code: http://pastie.org/2874305. Help?
[13:02:03] <Eviltwin> magic_hat: $(this).change
[13:02:12] <Eviltwin> $(this).getAttribute
[13:02:20] <Eviltwin> $("#id").html($(this).val())
[13:02:40] <Eviltwin> Or $(".monitor").change(function(){...
[13:03:16] <magic_hat> Eviltwin: thanks, my first go-round w/ jquery.
[13:03:21] <magic_hat> obviously
[13:03:23] <phlp> probably also $("#" + id)
[13:03:37] <magic_hat> right, I was wondering how to handle that.
[13:04:09] <jwmann> I know slideUp() hides and element. Can I show it with the same animation?
[13:05:05] <Stereo> I want to fadeOut() an element, then remove it, then do other things that depend on the element not existing anymore, is there a way to make that happen?
[13:06:07] <kategeek> Stereo: the fadeOut callback
[13:07:04] <jwmann> Stereo: .fadeOut("slow", function() { //Do stuff });
[13:07:20] <Dave_Stein> is there any reason in 1.7 that jQuery.somevar wouldnt work as $.somevar if it did in 1.6?
[13:08:52] <Stereo> ah, great!
[13:09:00] <Stereo> thanks kategeek and jwmann
[13:09:20] <jwmann> np
[13:14:45] <Dave_Stein> i think there's a bug in <=IE8 in regards to noConflict
[13:14:46] <monk12> Anyone decent with YQL. I have a question about Yahoo's example tutorial if can private message me off the board since its not related to jquery
[13:15:56] <jwmann> I know slideUp() hides an element. Can I 'show' it with the same animation?
[13:17:11] <kategeek> jwmann: you want to have an element appear from the bottom? the opposite of slideDown the opposite otherwise
[13:17:27] <jwmann> kategeek: Yea
[13:17:38] <sente> speaking of IE, does anyone have IE<8 who would be willing to run a simple tset for mE?
[13:17:47] <sente> I just need to see if an uploader works
[13:18:07] <shodan45> is there a jquery way to get all css classes of an element? other than .attr('class')?
[13:18:33] <jwmann> shodan45: That's the way I know.
[13:18:37] <context> uh, is there a way to get 'the next element' from a current selector
[13:18:54] <jwmann> context: .next()
[13:19:18] <context> ahh thnx
[13:19:50] <jwmann> context: http://api.jquery.com/next-adjacent-Selector/
[13:19:51] <jwmann> np
[13:19:52] <shodan45> jwmann: hm, seems odd to have .addClass, .removeClass, .toggleClass, & hasClass.... but no .getClasses()
[13:20:28] <context> jwmann: tried that but didnt work, but my initial selector was wrong not next() ;)
[13:20:32] <jwmann> shodan45: $("Myelement").attr('class' = "sepcificclass")
[13:20:47] <jwmann> maybe?
[13:20:49] <context> no
[13:20:52] <kategeek> $("Myelement").attr('class', "sepcificclass")
[13:21:10] <jwmann> shodan45: what kategeek said
[13:21:22] <context> shodan45: .attr('class') to 'getClasses'
[13:21:49] <Eviltwin> It'd be nice to have $(...).classes() to get an array of the classes
[13:22:03] <Eviltwin> And $(...).classes(/^foo/) to get an array of all of the classes that match that regex
[13:22:12] <jwmann> context: I think maybe you'd want to do something like this $("foo").parent().next()
[13:22:22] <context> eviltwin: you can always do that....
[13:22:22] <Eviltwin> And $(...).classes(function(x){...}) to get an array of all of the classes that match that filter
[13:22:37] <Eviltwin> context: ?
[13:22:47] <Eviltwin> You mean I can define a function to do that?
[13:22:53] <Eviltwin> Or one already exists
[13:22:54] <context> you can add to the jQuery object, we call them plugins
[13:22:55] <jwmann> kategeek: Any luck on my animation thing?
[13:23:12] <Eviltwin> context: Right, but I'd like it to be part of the core :D
[13:23:55] <kategeek> jwmann: looking at this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js
[13:24:02] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: you can propose it for 1.8 :p
[13:24:12] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Donde?
[13:24:18] <ajpiano> but i donno, that's a little bit sugary and specific to be added to core imo
[13:24:33] <jwmann> kategeek: That looks confusing. xD
[13:24:35] <Eviltwin> I've run into it enough
[13:24:42] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: there'll be a blog post
[13:24:45] <Eviltwin> Where one or all of those would be helpful
[13:24:46] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: i've *never* run into that
[13:25:00] <ajpiano> .attr("class").split(" ") ?
[13:25:02] <phlp> isnt it just $(foo).attr('class').split(' ') ?
[13:25:06] <Eviltwin> The other two
[13:25:10] <phlp> heh
[13:25:27] <Eviltwin> Generally, the only time I run into is is when people are abusing classes as tags
[13:25:34] <Eviltwin> But I run into that a lot, unfortunately
[13:25:41] <ajpiano> is that even a thing?
[13:25:44] <Eviltwin> Earlier someone was trying to do that
[13:25:56] <kategeek> jwmann, agreed, not sure exactly what slideUp does tbh, is it just animating padding margin and height?
[13:26:05] <ajpiano> i think that accomodating those people is a bad idea, lol
[13:26:10] <Eviltwin> Heh
[13:27:39] <jwmann> kategeek: I really don't know; but it hides it as intended

[13:42:02] <billwalton> i need some help with the countdown timer plugin
[13:42:04] <kanzie> Im having a mysterious problem with an array in the module-pattern. It reads the initial value even though I add items to the array. http://jsfiddle.net/4Xa3j/
[13:42:23] <magic_hat> so my jquery function is doing nothing to the page. I've pared it down to a simple alert (http://pastie.org/2874305). Console shows no errors, alert isn't firing. Thoughts?
[13:42:41] <phlp> Eviltwin: actually maybe it doesnt, i clicked the button ;) but wouldnt it have to be name="submit" and $("form")[0].submit for that to happen?
[13:42:56] <billwalton> I've got a number of divs that have timers on them
[13:43:08] <billwalton> they're supposed to be independent
[13:43:40] <billwalton> each is inside a container and has a sibling with the time remaining in that div
[13:44:05] <billwalton> $('.time_remaining').countdown({until: $("#time_remaining_1").siblings(".zero_hour").text()
[13:44:24] <billwalton> #time_remaining_1 is one of the divs
[13:44:40] <billwalton> with class='time_remaining'
[13:44:44] <billwalton> that works
[13:44:53] <billwalton> but of course is not what i waht
[13:45:02] <billwalton> what i thought i could do is"
[13:45:16] <billwalton> $('.time_remaining').countdown({until: $(this).siblings(".zero_hour").text()
[13:45:35] <billwalton> there $(this) is the selected element
[13:45:41] <billwalton> no workie
[13:45:44] <billwalton> any help?
[13:46:41] <Guest63457> hi, can after I .load, can I call a click event on something in there
[13:46:52] <nimred> hello all. I have a set of checkboxes on every html pages of my website and i am looking for a way to make selected checkboxes to stay checked when next pqge will is loaded. Any idea ?
[13:47:06] <kborchers> billwalton: .siblings() will return multiple elements so you can't use .text() there
[13:50:40] <billwalton> kborchers: ok.  so that explains that
[13:51:13] <billwalton> kborchers: so how do i get at that element?
[13:52:00] <kborchers> you could do siblings().eq(0) if there is only one or if you know where in the dom that sibling is you can use .next() or .prev()

[14:08:57] <oojacoboo> my god
[14:09:05] <context> unitListPos is NOT a number if you are getting " **" thats that
[14:09:09] <context> console.log() is a good tool
[14:09:13] <ryanneufeld> your god won't help you
[14:09:14] <ryanneufeld> but we will

[14:09:24] <ryanneufeld> I've done this before

[14:09:41] <oojacoboo> I have about 200k lines of code
[14:09:50] <ryanneufeld> some guy was all like "OMFG YOU DON"T NEED TO SEE IT"
[14:09:52] <context> do you even know what your problem is ?
[14:09:53] <kborchers> billwalton: the issue is most likely that $(this) is not what you expect there. set a var to $(".time_remaining").next(".zero_hour").text() before you create your countdown then use that var
[14:09:54] <ryanneufeld> he had a ; when he wanted a ,

[14:10:21] <heruan> Anyone with IE8 who can confirm a bug on http://jsbin.com/usogez/2/ ?
[14:10:25] <ryanneufeld> no, you stated a limited scope one line
[14:10:27] <phlp> oojacoboo: when you say it is separating them how do you know? have you console.log it or alert?
[14:10:31] <context> "the quotes are the problems" isnt a problem
[14:10:35] <ryanneufeld> it could be 200 lines above your problem
[14:10:40] <oojacoboo> phlp: I can see it in the DOM...
[14:10:58] <phlp> see what? is it appending something? you are getting an attr you shouldnt see that
[14:11:01] <context> do you get an error? does it just not work?
[14:11:12] <oojacoboo> context: no error
[14:11:13] <context> why are pepople afraid to write MORE THAN ONE SENTENCE when asking for help ?
[14:11:20] <oojacoboo> just a 1 as an atttr outside the quotes
[14:11:27] <oojacoboo> or whatever number that's the var
[14:11:48] <context> so console.log the damn "#element-"+unitBlah , and make sure its really wtf you are looking for
[14:11:50] <phlp> sounds like your html is the problem if you are seeing that
[14:12:00] <context> check that your function is getting what you actually expect it to.
[14:12:21] <oojacoboo> it worked before upgrading jquery
[14:12:28] <oojacoboo> w/e, I'll dig
[14:12:42] <phlp> oojacoboo: have you tried "#unit-result-1" without the var?
[14:12:45] <context> oojacoboo: we cant help you with one line of code and .. "the quotes dont work"
[14:12:55] <context> and NOW you are saying you just upgraded jquery
[14:13:16] <phlp> context needs more context bro
[14:13:16] <oojacoboo> context: that's why I say it's a syntax issue, but if it's correct, then it's correct
[14:13:16] <ryanneufeld> context: just give up on his ass
[14:13:34] <context> so techinically its a problem you created. so check the damn jquery change log and update your code accordingly
[14:13:39] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: are you getting a syntax error?
[14:13:43] <context> or... revert jquery
[14:13:43] <oojacoboo> no
[14:13:52] <ryanneufeld> Then how is it suddenly a syntax error?
[14:14:20] <oojacoboo> it's not a 'syntax error' it's a syntax issue
[14:14:20] <ryanneufeld> can you paste at least the function containing this code?
[14:14:23] <context> oojacoboo: and how do you even know they line you are pastiing us is the line thats erroring
[14:14:31] <context> you never even described a problem to begin with
[14:14:33] <oojacoboo> thanks guys, I'll find it
[14:14:41] <oojacoboo> just wanted to know if that syntax was the issue
[14:14:57] <context> if the syntax is an issue the browser will tell you
[14:15:03] <context> in the form of an "ERROR MESSAGE"
[14:15:12] <oojacoboo> k
[14:18:50] <oojacoboo> I found the issue, it was syntax in another line
[14:18:55] <oojacoboo> thanks for the clarifications
[14:19:29] <phlp> can you paste that?
[14:19:40] <oojacoboo> searchResults += '<li name="search-result"><a href="#" id="unit-result-'+jsonResultsTotal+'" class="" name="unit-result-'+unit.id+'"><div class="title">'+address+'</div></a></li>';
[14:19:47] <oojacoboo> corrected syntax ^^
[14:20:09] <oojacoboo> I was looking at the wrong line… it was the one creating the html, not reading it :/
[14:20:52] <context> that is ugly as all hell
[14:21:13] <oojacoboo> context: good
[14:21:23] <context> so.. it was a syntax error
[14:21:33] <oojacoboo> issue*
[14:21:35] <oojacoboo> no error
[14:22:15] <sente> oojacoboo: just curious, if you type '...' is it automatically converted to … by your IRC client?
[14:22:39] <oojacoboo> likely not… '...'
[14:22:48] <kborchers> oojacoboo: that would be less likely to happen if you separate your html from your js ... just fyi
[14:23:09] <oojacoboo> kborchers: that sounds nice, but how would you do that in this case?
[14:23:19] <oojacoboo> where you need variables in your html that gets output to the DOM
[14:23:22] <kborchers> templating
[14:23:31] <oojacoboo> overhead in this case
[14:23:34] <oojacoboo> this is a one liner
[14:23:52] <sente> oojacoboo: so you take the time to manually type out … -- however it's done, I have no idea
[14:23:58] <kborchers> just a suggestion
[14:24:20] <oojacoboo> kborchers: we do that for larger html blocks
[14:24:32] <oojacoboo> for this is just a list item one liner for an autocomplete
[14:25:03] <nimred> hello all. I have a set of checkboxes on every html pages of my website and i am looking for a way to make selected checkboxes to stay checked when next pqge will is loaded. Any idea ?
[14:25:19] <sente> nimred: you could use cookies
[14:26:40] <nimred> sente: which way ?
[14:27:32] <context> you could update the page using ajax requests
[14:27:48] <sente> well the cookie would remember which ones are checked, and then check/uncheck them as appropriate once the page loads
[14:28:05] <context> or send ajax request when items are checked, then the server knows what to put as checked for next page
[14:28:06] <sente> a likeliy better way to do this be with server-side coding
[14:28:17] <context> sente: will not work on GET links
[14:28:29] <sente> context: hrm?
[14:28:35] <sente> what work for GET links?
[14:29:22] <sente> ah, i know what you meant
[14:29:24] <sente> well yeah
[14:29:43] <sente> ajax to the rescure
[14:29:46] <sente> *rescue
[14:30:01] <nimred> isn't it possible using jquery ?!
[14:30:56] <sente> nimred: if the page reloads then you lose all your state so you need to store this info in ether cookies or have the server remember for you
[14:31:25] <nimred> sente: ok so i choose cookies
[14:31:35] <sente> and then ask the server when the new page is loaded (and/or have the server just spew out the correct HTML for the checked/unchecked fields)
[14:31:37] <nimred> but still dop not know which way to do this
[14:31:48] <heruan> Last call for help: anyone with IE8 or a virtual machine is able to help me? I'm suffering of a closed bug, so I suspect it's my fault somewhere but the code is simple and the bug fires up :(
[14:32:00] <__n1v3K> this sh*t is scary
[14:32:02] <__n1v3K> http://americancensorship.org/
[14:32:48] <sente> heruan: I have IE6 and IE8,(or maybe it's 9) on other computerse
[14:32:53] <sente> nimred: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[14:34:11] <phlp> heruan: you can change the version in ie developer tools
[14:34:53] <heruan> sente: thank you! if you're able to check http://jsbin.com/usogez/2/ on IE8 and inspect the second "Hello World", check if you get <:section> instead of <section>.
[14:36:11] <heruan> phlp: I know, thank you. I'm just looking for someone who can confirm that a bug closed as fixed, it's not. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485
[14:37:19] <sente> heh i dont even know how to 'inspect' things on IE
[14:37:32] <kategeek> sente: f12
[14:37:51] <kategeek> it's no firebug though
[14:37:56] <sente> doesn't do  anything
[14:38:00] <sente> ah krikey
[14:38:01] <sente> this is IE7
[14:38:04] <sente> one sec
[14:38:22] <sente> I've grown to like Chrome's dev tools more than Firebug
[14:39:32] <kategeek> how do you get a multiline console input with chrome?
[14:40:25] <kategeek> shift+enter works but you loose cursor position
[14:40:51] <sente> more importantly, how do you get Firebug to ENTER shit you type without pressing the button with your mouse
[14:41:03] <sente> and then have it disappear from the input bufffer
[14:41:06] <sente> without manually deleting it
[14:41:13] <nimred> ok thanks sente :)
[14:41:20] <sente> at one point I surely used firebug better
[14:41:29] <kategeek> ctrl+enter to execute
[14:41:40] <sente> heruan: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nY5kD0xAEPE/TsQ72GN41kI/AAAAAAAAFGo/ZZGZWsc0VOE/s1067/1321483222522.png
[14:41:59] <sente> looks like <:section>
[14:42:08] <heruan> sente: I see, thank you!
[14:42:34] <sente> no problemo
[14:42:43] <heruan> So it seems #6485 isn't really fixed.

[14:47:34] <magnetik> hi
[14:47:47] <coldhead> hi magnetik
[14:47:51] <magnetik> $("input[id^='read_']").click(function() { < is there any way to get the complete id the function ?
[14:47:57] <heruan> Okay men, it seems the clone issue was reopened in a new bug #10667, fixed on 1.7.1!
[14:48:13] <bakers> magnetik: .attr('id') ???
[14:48:16] <heruan> How can I test the trunk jQuery version?
[14:48:40] <magnetik> bakers, on what element ? $this ?
[14:48:52] <bakers> magnetik: Yep
[14:50:20] <magnetik> Yeah ! Works great. And any hint on what function I could use to seperate 1 from the read_1 element ?
[14:50:23] <magnetik> thanks anyway
[14:50:39] <bakers> magnetik: Separate what?
[14:50:49] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you attending summit 2011?
[14:50:52] <magnetik> the id is reak_1, I would like to get the 1
[14:51:05] <coldhead> no, ryry, i'm banned from such things
[14:51:07] <bakers> magnetik: use a regexp
[14:51:13] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc .split() @ magnetik
[14:51:14] <bot-t> magnetik, split - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[14:51:25] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: banned? What did you do?
[14:52:48] <heruan> Tested with //code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js and I confirm it's fixed!
[14:52:59] <someprimetime> is there a way to target a submit button without an id? like say the only one within the form? something like $('form > input[submit]')?
[14:53:03] <heruan> Thank you guys.
[14:53:24] <shesek> someprimetime, input[type=submit]
[14:53:30] <someprimetime> thanks shesek
[14:53:33] <heruan> ryanneufeld: P.S. Loved your bot tricks ;)
[14:53:42] <magnetik> Thanks a lot :)
[14:53:46] <magnetik> Works great :)
[14:58:26] <monstaRtruck> look at this crazynes guys
[14:58:27] <monstaRtruck> <a class="soft_button_white event" bind="click" action="OrderModule.CancelOrder();"><span>Cancel</span></a>
[14:58:47] <monstaRtruck> now i can handle all my events at once
[14:58:52] <monstaRtruck> and program them w html
[14:59:13] <phlp> welcome to 1995
[15:01:19] <jedimind_> man
[15:01:22] <jedimind_> the other day i saw
[15:02:24] <monstaRtruck> no way
[15:02:28] <monstaRtruck> i jus invented that
[15:02:30] <monstaRtruck> rite now
[15:02:30] <jedimind_> <a href="" onmouseover="mouseoverFunction(anchorID)" onmouseout="mouseoutFunction(anchorID)" id="anchorID">...</a> function mouseOverFunction(anchor) { getElementById('anchor'); this.color="#f00" } ...
[15:02:32] <jedimind_> sorry i was typing it all
[15:02:49] <jedimind_> so he created 2 functions and passed the ID of the element you just clicked on just to change the colour on mousein/out
[15:02:55] <jedimind_> and this was coded in the last 2 months
[15:03:27] <jedimind_> err hovered, not clicked, you get th eidea
[15:03:53] <phlp> monstaRtruck: you re-invented onclick="OrderModule.CancelOrder();"
[15:05:12] <ryanneufeld> and on top of that, it's less clear
[15:08:02] <appl3s> can someone have a look at my short pastebin and help me figure out why i can't get the title from an <a> tag please? i'm trying to grab it using $(this).attr('title'); but it doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/jHKAC47D
[15:08:45] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: it's just a precaution
[15:08:52] <coldhead> my lawyers greenlighted it
[15:09:06] <ryanneufeld> I sense a but coming?
[15:09:43] <coldhead> no sir
[15:10:51] <phlp> appl3s: $(this) will work in your click callback but on line 14 you will have to select the 'a.btip'
[15:11:38] <appl3s> phlp: sorry, I don't quite understand what you mean :3
[15:11:47] <appl3s> I should replace this with 'a.btip'?
[15:12:26] <phlp> appl3s: yes 'this' on line 14 has nothing to do with your link you should use 'a.btip'
[15:12:41] <appl3s> I tried that btw, but it didn't change anything. In fact it kind of breaks the tooltip
[15:15:00] <Chomper> hello.  how do i add 50px height to an object that has css height: auto
[15:15:08] <appl3s> oh hmm... maybe you're right
[15:15:28] <phlp> appl3s: you have a type on line 16 an extra ) at the end of the line. )}); should be });
[15:15:34] <phlp> typo
[15:16:15] <appl3s> phlp: thank you so much! that fixed it
[15:17:03] <appl3s> although this brings me to my other problem. The reason I was using "this" is because I want to be able to have multiple instances of this. So this code will automatically go to the first instance of class="btip" rather than the one that's clicked on. How do I access the one that's clicked on?
[15:18:23] <phlp> appl3s: 'this' inside your click callback will be the one that was clicked on. if you want the first you can do 'a.btip:first'
[15:18:25] <appl3s> do I need to each() through all instances of b.tip?
[15:18:52] <appl3s> phlp: pardon me, but what is the click callback? I'm not familiar with that
[15:19:07] <monstaRtruck> how sick is this
[15:19:08] <monstaRtruck> $('.event').each(function(i) {
[15:19:08] <monstaRtruck> 	$(this).bind($(this).attr('bind'), function() {
[15:19:08] <monstaRtruck> 		eval($(this).attr('action'));
[15:19:08] <monstaRtruck> 	});
[15:19:08] <monstaRtruck> });
[15:19:18] <monstaRtruck> ^^
[15:19:23] <monstaRtruck> :O
[15:19:27] <phlp> appl3s: lines 18-20 are inside the callback.. inside the click event
[15:19:47] <phlp> appl3s: the function() { } is a callback
[15:21:11] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ monstaRtruck
[15:21:11] <bot-t> monstaRtruck, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:21:12] <appl3s> oh ok, thank you
[15:21:18] <monstaRtruck> ok
[15:21:50] <monstaRtruck> did u guys understand what my functin does
[15:21:52] <monstaRtruck> >>>???
[15:21:57] <Chomper> how do i make #test height 50px taller with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/fq4eZ/
[15:22:13] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: people here ignore pasted code.
[15:22:19] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ monstaRtruck
[15:22:19] <bot-t> monstaRtruck, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:22:48] <phlp> monstaRtruck: creates a crappy version of onclick that uses eval
[15:23:05] <Chomper> i need to get the height of #test and then change it to that height + 50
[15:23:26] <appl3s> hmm...
[15:23:32] <ryanneufeld> ?css() @ Chomper
[15:23:32] <bot-t> Chomper, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[15:24:38] <phlp> Chomper: $('#test').height($('#test').height() + 50);
[15:24:44] <Chomper> fine then i figured it out on my own http://jsfiddle.net/fq4eZ/1/
[15:24:55] <Chomper> oh whoops i mean thanks guys
[15:24:58] <phlp> ;)
[15:26:36] <Chomper> my actual problem is that the container isn't automatically the correct height for some reason
[15:26:36] <ryanneufeld> Chomper: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/fq4eZ/2/
[15:26:41] <Chomper> but this is a good work around
[15:27:14] <ryanneufeld> Chomper: sounds like you have a css problem
[15:27:16] <Chomper> nice ryanneufeld that is even better
[15:27:19] <eddiemonge> silly question, especially for me, but do i need jQueryUI to be able to use the widget factory?
[15:27:38] <phlp> Chomper: http://jsfiddle.net/fq4eZ/3
[15:27:46] <phlp> padding: 10px 10px 60px 10px;
[15:28:05] <appl3s> phew, finally sussed it. thank you so much phlp for your time and help :)
[15:28:08] <Chomper> phlp: that wont do it in this case
[15:28:23] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/fq4eZ/4/
[15:28:25] <Chomper> ryanneufeld: can i show you?
[15:28:45] <phlp> why wont that do it?
[15:28:59] <Chomper> well
[15:29:07] <Chomper> here
[15:29:09] <Chomper> http://newslife.co.cc/
[15:30:06] <appl3s> phlp: thank you so much for your help!
[15:30:13] <phlp> appl3s: you're welcome
[15:30:18] <Chomper> .rss-feed has height auto but there are vertical scroll bars?
[15:30:19] <Chomper> why?
[15:30:57] <phlp> Chomper: overflow:auto
[15:31:50] <Chomper> phlp: i removed that but it causes another problem
[15:31:51] <devc> Hey guys, items.eq(0) will get you to the 0 index of items, but what happens if I have items.click(function());, how do I find out which index has been clicked?
[15:31:53] <Chomper> its overflowing
[15:32:35] <devc> can I use .find to find a jQuery object, as in .find($(this));
[15:32:36] <devc> ?
[15:33:39] <phlp> Chomper: it's position:absolute on .lh
[15:34:29] <phlp> devc: why would you do that? you already have the jquery object
[15:35:17] <phlp> ? index @ devc
[15:35:18] <bot-t> devc, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[15:35:21] <devc> phlp: I have a javascript navigation, so I am wanting the navigation item to relate to a page item, but all pages are in one html
[15:35:26] <Chomper> phlp: awesome thank you. but that content is loaded from external rss feed.  how can i fix it?
[15:35:29] <dw> devc: $($(your obj), parent). .. but that's redundant
[15:35:47] <Chomper> can i override that css?
[15:36:34] <hackeron> Anyone? - why does this table not render correctly in IE9 until I click+drag one of the columns? < http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live
[15:36:46] <phlp> Chomper: it's in multiRSS.css so either change it there or somewhere after that
[15:36:52] <monstaRtruck> so everything i do is crapy
[15:36:54] <monstaRtruck> u suc
[15:37:47] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: ?
[15:38:01] <monstaRtruck> that func lets u design javascript code with html
[15:38:04] <monstaRtruck> dats why
[15:38:13] <phlp> monstaRtruck: no i was kidding, it's awesome that you made something. it's just not that practical
[15:38:30] <monstaRtruck> it handles every event
[15:38:35] <monstaRtruck> with html
[15:38:37] <Chomper> is is?
[15:38:39] <Chomper> hmm
[15:38:40] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: but it's completely redunant
[15:38:42] <monstaRtruck> how is that not practical
[15:38:44] <devc> phlp: Thanks. This is what I needed.
[15:38:50] <monstaRtruck> ok watever im leaving
[15:38:52] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: you now have TWO attributes
[15:38:55] <ryanneufeld> when none were needed
[15:39:10] <monstaRtruck> omg
[15:39:15] <monstaRtruck> u jus dun get it i think
[15:39:17] <Chomper> updating something i made a real long time ago, dont remember whats what.  thanks for the help phlp i got it now
[15:39:22] <ryanneufeld> http://cityofchapin.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_kyc36iigqt1qai0rbo1_500.jpg
[15:39:31] <phlp> Chomper: no problem
[15:39:54] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: where is that code paste we asked for?
[15:40:02] <monstaRtruck> y
[15:40:07] <monstaRtruck> u dun get it
[15:40:09] <ryanneufeld> are you just trolling, or do you actually want our input?
[15:40:10] <monstaRtruck> so it doesnt mater
[15:40:11] <Jon47> we all get it
[15:40:17] <monstaRtruck> no u dont
[15:40:26] <ryanneufeld> and your grammar is terrible
[15:40:28] <Jon47> i had to do something similar when I wrote templates for a CMS tool
[15:40:32] <ryanneufeld> FFS it's YOU
[15:40:36] <monstaRtruck> u create ur event and specify function to run w html
[15:40:40] <ryanneufeld> it's two fucking keystrokes, is it that hard?
[15:40:49] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: you can do that with onclick
[15:40:54] <monstaRtruck> omg
[15:40:59] <monstaRtruck> u dont get it get over it
[15:41:00] <monstaRtruck> jeeez
[15:41:03] <Jon47> i felt dirty doing it
[15:41:08] <ryanneufeld> monstaRtruck: you're an idiot
[15:41:21] <ryanneufeld> do a jsfiddle demoing your concept
[15:41:26] <ryanneufeld> and prove us wrong
[15:41:30] <monstaRtruck> ur an idiot
[15:41:41] <Jon47> i'm convinced this is a troll now
[15:41:47] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[15:41:54] <monstaRtruck> <input type="radio" name="shipping_method" class="event" bind="click" action="OrderModule.CalculateShipping($(this));
[15:41:56] <monstaRtruck> see
[15:42:18] <Jon47> we spent the last 10 years getting away from onclick attributes
[15:42:24] <Chomper> actually, phlp now my .rss-feed is too tall. why can't i figure this out? ugh
[15:42:34] <ryanneufeld> <input type="radio" name="shipping_method" onclick="OrderModule.CalculateShipping(this)
[15:42:37] <monstaRtruck> ok stfu i dun have time for nubs
[15:42:46] <ryanneufeld> go the fuck away then
[15:43:19] <phlp> Chomper: sorry cant help more time to go. good luck
[15:43:30] <Jon47> why is it bad?  because the code is not encapsulated, and the html page (the one resource that probably won't get cached in the browser) now contains all the code
[15:43:44] <monstaRtruck> <input type="text" name="items" class="event" bind="blur" action="OrderModule.ShowOrder(\'order\');" />
[15:43:54] <ryanneufeld> onblue
[15:43:56] <ryanneufeld> *onblur
[15:43:58] <ryanneufeld> same shit
[15:44:35] <monstaRtruck> not realy
[15:44:48] <Jon47> two "l"s in really

[15:45:11] <monstaRtruck> suk my butt
[15:46:08] <monstaRtruck> my function can be extended to handle many atribs
[15:46:17] <monstaRtruck> ur sux like crap
[15:46:29] <ryanneufeld> are you like 12?
[15:46:39] <nimred> sente: it looks like doing what i need without using cookies nor ajax : https://github.com/m3talsmith/jquery-value-checkbox
[15:46:41] <ryanneufeld> Thank you coldhead
[15:49:53] <zkirill> For some reason element being dragged gets shot into stratosphere (top: -3851px) when it's being dragged. Only occurs in FF, not Chrome
[15:51:49] <ryanneufeld> zkirill: are you using jqueryui?
[15:52:00] <zkirill> ryanneufeld: yes
[15:52:06] <ryanneufeld> that helps
[15:52:54] <ryanneufeld> are you using the containment param?
[15:53:02] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-containment
[15:53:35] <zkirill> ryanneufeld: no, I'll try that now, thank you very much
[15:55:40] <ryanneufeld> .seen monstaRtruck

[15:57:53] <jahrichie> hey all.  I have a image carousel on my homepage right now with a static height, I want each slide to have a dynamic height, and it to adjust like it does here http://hipinspire.com/work/nurall/#1 - any pointers on the best technique ?
[15:58:16] <ryanneufeld> zkirill: hmm, not sure man
[15:58:44] <zkirill> ryanneufeld: oh well thanks anyway :)
[15:59:12] <ryanneufeld> np
[15:59:33] <ryanneufeld> try with a clean version of FF? maybe an extension is messing w/ you?

[16:09:26] <sente> nimred: interesting... but the jquery-value-checkbox extension won't allow you to toggle the checkboxes and have the state retained between pageloads
[16:09:27] <hobs> I love the american government shooting its own tech industry in the face if it passes shit like this
[16:09:42] <hobs> did you hear the DOJ was going to release a statement saying violating a TOS is a criminal act
[16:09:46] <hobs> lulz tastic
[16:09:53] <ccmonster> hey guys, how do you do use jsonp data for the jquery ui auto complete?
[16:10:01] <ccmonster> The demo, doesn't really work for what I am trying to do
[16:10:12] <sente> ccmonster: the same you use jsonp anywhere else, just know ahead of time what function'll be called
[16:10:31] <ccmonster> hmm... is there a more elegant way than calling a seperate function?
[16:10:39] <ccmonster> like, within the autocomplete method/obj
[16:10:59] <sente> do you have an example of what you're trying to do?
[16:11:05] <ccmonster> sure one sec.
[16:16:02] <ccmonster> sente, http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JWLKQ/
[16:16:42] <ccmonster> ah , its not all set up
[16:18:25] <sente> yeah, I dunno what to do with it like that :p
[16:18:59] <ccmonster> haha, hold on

[16:19:07] <PcJamesy> hello
[16:19:11] <ccmonster> i didnt refactor it completely
[16:19:19] <ccmonster> sup PcJamesy , whats you need sir?
[16:19:46] <PcJamesy> just saying hi
[16:21:04] <ccmonster> i assume i'd use a $.when().done() statement inside the autocomplete source method, and just return the $.getJSON() from getDayLifeData(0
[16:23:34] <ccmonster> i saw somewhere there is a parse: method in the autocomplete, but i didnt see anything documented about it
[16:25:02] <ccmonster> any ideas sente
[16:27:04] <sssteven> hey all, I posted a question on the forums yesterday that hasn't gotten any responses forum.jquery.com/topic/deferred-callback-list-behavior-and-stoponfalse
[16:27:16] <zkirill> For some reason my element being dragged by jQuery UI shifts upwards away from the cursor by the amount of page height of the parent that's currently not visible (for example if it's in a div that is 1300px high and the screen is 900px then it the element would jump up 400px) Any ideas?
[16:27:23] <sssteven> wondering if I made it too wordy?
[16:27:50] <sssteven> first time poster, so I'd appreciate any input
[16:28:28] <ccmonster> sssteven, you talking about $.when()
[16:28:29] <ccmonster> and all that
[16:28:40] <sente> sorry I was afk, ccmonster
[16:28:44] <ccmonster> np
[16:28:55] <ccmonster> ?q $.when()
[16:28:56] <bot-t> ccmonster, Plugins/Autocomplete/autocomplete - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/autocomplete
[16:29:00] <zkirill> ryanneufeld: any thoughts? :(
[16:29:21] <sssteven> ccmonster: talking about the defferreds returned by $.ajax as of 1.6 (the XHR object)
[16:29:30] <ccmonster> is it 1.6?
[16:29:45] <sssteven> it might have been introduced in 1.5 acutally
[16:30:07] <sssteven> but no, what I'm talking about isn't in 1.6 or 1.7 master on github
[16:30:20] <sssteven> the 'stopOnFalse' flag is new as of 1.7

[16:31:03] <ccmonster> what is your issue. ask away
[16:31:21] <sente> hrm
[16:31:24] <sente> for one, https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--KLmHKHi_q8/TsRV0NzF8RI/AAAAAAAAFGw/JuYW3XN7JCs/s512/1321489867868.png
[16:32:03] <hackeron> Anyone? - why does this table not render correctly in IE9 until I click+drag one of the columns? < http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live
[16:32:07] <ccmonster> whats up sente?
[16:32:46] <jaidan> Hey all, I'm struggling with  the new .on() function.  I have a series of elements (added by ajax).  Clicking anywhere (except on one of the links) within the element triggers one behavior (changes the page), while clicking a link keeps you on the same page but ajax's in new search results
[16:32:51] <Newbi> hi all :))
[16:33:04] <jaidan> No matter what I do I can't seem to stop the page change
[16:33:42] <sssteven> ccmonster: my issue is that callbacks registered with deffereds using done() and fail() do not currently have a way of communicating (read: returning a value) that controls whether subsequent callbacks run
[16:34:49] <ccmonster> so a deferreds callback promise
[16:34:54] <sssteven> jaidan: do you have it working with .delegate()?
[16:34:54] <ccmonster> fixed that sente
[16:35:02] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JWLKQ/3/
[16:35:29] <jaidan> sssteven: no, we moving from a design that used .live and didn't have this requirement
[16:35:51] <ccmonster> i take delegate over live any day
[16:35:59] <zkirill> Okay, I think this is a bonafide jQuery UI bug, I'm going to submit at bugs.jqueryui.com
[16:36:02] <sssteven> 2nd that ^
[16:36:23] <jaidan> that's why we're moving to the 1.7's .on function =)
[16:36:24] <ccmonster> me love context :)
[16:36:26] <sente> ccmonster: your javascript had some parse errors
[16:36:31] <sente> those aside though, I'm not very sure
[16:36:31] <ccmonster> yea. i fixed them
[16:36:33] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JWLKQ/3/
[16:37:06] <sente> so this doesnt work at all for me
[16:37:08] <sente> or i'm confused
[16:37:45] <ccmonster> well, unfort theres no way to get that data because its jsonp
[16:37:52] <ccmonster> and they dont support it
[16:38:00] <ccmonster> so I have to use a proxy php script
[16:38:14] <sente> that's easy enough though
[16:38:29] <Newbi> hi all...just a simple question
[16:38:37] <ccmonster> not sure of the ajax setup that's all
[16:38:46] <sssteven> jaidan: perhaps you switched the two selectors?
[16:38:51] <Newbi> I'm trying to create a new function
[16:38:53] <Newbi> $.fn.test = function(param1,param1) {alert(param1+' '+param1);}
[16:38:53] <Newbi> $(this).test('one','two');
[16:38:56] <ccmonster> ah i see
[16:39:02] <Newbi> dosn't work..
[16:39:08] <Newbi> any help? :)
[16:39:12] <ccmonster> source:source.php. but how to handle data type
[16:39:32] <jaidan> sssteven: Actually just broke it in a new way =/  Now clicking the links has the desired behavior, but clicking anywhere else in the element doesn't do anything
[16:40:17] <sssteven> jaidan: that is .on()'s behavior, if I understand you correctly
[16:40:35] <ccmonster> everything seems hardcodes at 'term'
[16:41:27] <Newbi> $.fn.test = function(param1,param2) {alert(param1+' '+param2);}
[16:41:30] <Newbi> sorry
[16:41:30] <Newbi> :)
[16:43:01] <Newbi> ccmonster any advices for me? :)
[16:43:09] <jaidan> sssteven: Maybe a snippet will make this clearer as to what I'm trying to do and not sure how to do it with .on: http://pastebin.com/JbEx4QjL
[16:45:19] <sssteven> jaiden: event.stopPropagation will not prevent the default action
[16:45:36] <sssteven> you must either return false, or call event.preventDefault
[16:46:20] <sssteven> (I think what is happening is that the link is doing it's normal thing)
[16:46:22] <jaidan> sssteven: hmm preventing the default action doesn't seem to be an issue in this case as the default behavior of this link is fine
[16:46:44] <jaidan> sssteven: The issue now is that clicking anywhere but the link isn't doing anything
[16:47:11] <sssteven> jaidan: define 'doing anything', what should be happening?
[16:47:46] <supsup> trees attackin people prob.
[16:47:50] <jaidan> not doing anything = the second click handler in that snippet isn't getting called
[16:48:00] <ccmonster> sente, , http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JWLKQ/6/
[16:48:04] <jaidan> supposed to happen = call the handler and trigger a page change
[16:48:07] <ccmonster> there. i am using a jsonp data piece
[16:48:27] <sssteven> ahh, is the #plants element a parent of .plant_cont elements?
[16:48:50] <jaidan> yup
[16:49:02] <sssteven> if so, the first handler is preventing the click from bubbling up to the #plant element
[16:49:03] <jaidan> I can show you my dev site if that will give it some html context
[16:49:27] <sssteven> (when you call event.stopPropagation)
[16:49:46] <jaidan> hmm shouldn't that only get called when I click on one of the links?
[16:49:57] <jaidan> firebug doesn't seem like it's indicating that getting called
[16:50:30] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JWLKQ/8/
[16:50:33] <sssteven> it won't get called, since the click event never bubbles up to the #plant
[16:51:06] <zkirill> ryanneufeld: Figured it out, it was html { overflow-y: scroll }
[16:51:18] <ccmonster> bah. not jsonp source either. fuuuuuuuuuuck
[16:51:47] <sssteven> jaidan: why do you need to use .on() for the second bit (the anchor that does prep and redirects)
[16:52:24] <Newbi> http://pastebin.com/tQh4MWps
[16:52:44] <jaidan> sssteven: .plant_cont elements are all added by ajax, they change whenever a user makes various selections on the site
[16:52:53] <sssteven> ahh, right
[16:53:21] <jaidan> This would all be trivial if it wasn't for ajaxing in all the elements
[16:53:27] <gentoofan> I am redesigning a website for someone and I am using Chrome's element inspector to view details of the CSS in use because how the existing website uses CSS is a mess. It has auto-refresh implemented with jQuery, which is crashing Chrome's element inspector. Is there a workaround that I can use to disable that? It is a live site written with a ASP.NET backend the code is a huge mess and I mostly know LAMP, so I don't want to try replicating the w
[16:54:06] <jaidan> I basically have a series of boxes, whenever you click anywhere in the box it takes you to the detail page for that box.  However if you click some of the links present in the box it changes your search instead of taking you to the detail page
[16:54:08] <sssteven> indeed :)
[16:55:29] <sssteven> seems like you need to add a handler to those links specifically that stops propagation
[16:55:39] <sssteven> then add a handler for the entire container that does the redirect
[16:55:48] <Newbi> passing only one param to the function works...with two..no :(
[16:55:49] <jaidan> Isn't that what I have already?
[16:56:07] <Newbi> http://pastebin.com/tQh4MWps
[16:56:17] <jaidan> the first handler targets only the links and stops propagation.  the second targets the container
[16:56:51] <jaidan> well apparently it doesn't target the containers since it's not working, but it looks like it should to me
[16:57:04] <sssteven> ahh yes, ok just try using event.stopImmediatePropagation() then
[16:57:25] <sssteven> and bind them both to #plant
[16:57:51] <gentoofan> Nevemrind. I just figured out why it is refreshing like that. It has a ton of javascript, but it doesn't use any of it. It is doing a HTTP refresh. -_-
[16:57:58] <sssteven> at that point the order matters, and when the link one gets fired it will prevent the next one from firing
[16:59:37] <sssteven> something like this perhaps: http://pastebin.com/FwFHH3rE
[17:00:05] <sssteven> I'm not sure how .delegate() handles stopImmediatePropagation() though
[17:00:49] <sssteven> it should just stop all remaining 'click' handlers from running, but it might check that the selector is the same
[17:00:50] <jaidan> Yeah I'm trying that now, I'm not sure why but it's now not working for the links or the container.  Which if I can figure out why that is I might be able to solve the whole thing
[17:01:58] <jaidan> Just to make sure #plants is static, it's always there just it's content change.  That wouldn't be causing the issue would it?
[17:02:35] <sssteven> no, that's what you want
[17:03:16] <jaidan> ok well with both handlers bound to #plants, neither one gets called no matter where I click
[17:03:52] <jaidan> very weird
[17:04:16] <sssteven> that's... odd
[17:06:18] <matt_jq123> how do you call/make functions?
[17:06:26] <dkog> Hi - what's the latest with support for live() with 'change' event on SELECT elements in IE?

[17:41:22] <Axsuul> Anyone using jquery outside events plugin? I have form input fields inside a container, and I am binding clickoutside to that container. However, if I click on the input fields within the container, clickoutside seems to be triggered. Any suggestions?
[17:41:23] <Newbi> my issue is a newbe one :)
[17:41:42] <Newbi> but nobody helps me :)
[17:41:54] <matt_jq123> whats your issue?

[17:42:05] <Newbi> that one

[17:42:41] <Newbi> passing one param to the function work...with two no...

[17:43:28] <snover> I highly doubt that your minimal test case actually exposes whatever behaviour you feel is wrong newbi.
[17:43:43] <matt_jq123> and I don't connsider myself a newbi
[17:44:13] <matt_jq123> snover, do you know how to use the force?
[17:44:22] <Newbi> snover is simple the first sample work the secondo no...
[17:44:39] <Newbi> the first one pass a param to a function
[17:44:39] <snover> I think if you’re in Windows you just press Alt+F4 to use the force
[17:44:55] <Newbi> the second one pass two...
[17:45:06] <sente> speaking of uploads, can you test an upload for me?
[17:45:09] <sente> afterwards?
[17:45:20] <matt_jq123> not that force snover
[17:45:23] <Newbi> it's minimal but I don't know why...

[19:04:51] <ryanneufeld> it not being an input for starters
[19:05:24] <teasp00n> its a text input

[19:14:42] <fatguylaughing> Some able to help me http://jsfiddle.net/MzZkE/5/ ?
[19:15:21] <shesek> fatguylaughing, what's the problem?
[19:15:26] <scrandaddy> i'm developing a jquery widget and i've implemented static methods that don't operate on a dom element by adding a traditional plugin to $.myPluginName. is there any built in way to do this with the widget factory?
[19:15:36] <scrandaddy> or a better way to do it for that matter
[19:15:45] <fatguylaughing> shesek: Well I have two <a> tags and two <div> tags.
[19:15:56] <shesek> fatguylaughing, and you are aware that you can simply use .hide() and .show() instead of using classes, right?
[19:16:07] <fatguylaughing> shesek: no.
[19:16:14] <fatguylaughing> <--- noob on Jquery and JS
[19:16:16] <fatguylaughing> :(
[19:16:21] <shesek> well, than, you can
[19:16:31] <fatguylaughing> shesek: Ok, let me try that real quick :)
[19:16:31] <shesek> $(...).hide(), $(...).show()
[19:16:48] <shesek> fatguylaughing, what's the problem tho?
[19:17:20] <fatguylaughing> shesek: ok so if you click a <a> tag then it needs to show the proper div and hide the other one if it is visible.
[19:17:22] <shesek> fatguylaughing, also, instead of .hasClass('show') you can use .is(':visible') to determine if an element is visible or not
[19:17:25] <fatguylaughing> and vice versa
[19:17:44] <fatguylaughing> shesek: ok
[19:18:04] <shesek> and you can also use .toggle() to toggle the visibility of an element
[19:18:46] <shesek> and it seems like the removeClass('hide') should be in an `else`, shouldn't it?
[19:19:16] <shesek> I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do, but it seems like $('.font-click').click(function() {$('#scroll-types').toggle();}) should do the trick
[19:19:30] <shesek> oh, wait, no, ignore that
[19:19:39] <shesek> explain what you're trying to do first
[19:19:55] <fatguylaughing> I did above? Did I not explain well? I tend not to. :(
[19:20:28] <teasp00n> fyi: the id had a period in it that i needed to escape
[19:21:06] <fatguylaughing> shesek: So if you click the <a class="font-click"> I need to show the <div id="font-types"> and hide the <div id="scroll-types">
[19:21:53] <shesek> fatguylaughing, $('.font-click').click(function() { $('#font-types').show(); $('#scroll-types').hide(); }); ?
[19:22:12] * fatguylaughing faceplam
[19:22:15] <fatguylaughing> palm*
[19:22:41] <fatguylaughing> shesek: Was so stuck thinking that I had to have an if statement due to the way I was doing it.
[19:22:48] <crab> fatguylaughing: http://jsfiddle.net/MzZkE/7/
[19:24:14] <fatguylaughing> crab: I also need the same a tag to close the div it opened if click a second time.
[19:24:17] <shesek> yeah, that if confused me... that's why I didn't quite understand what you're trying to do
[19:24:59] <crab> fatguylaughing: so always hide() the other, and toggle() your own
[19:25:28] <fatguylaughing> shesek: Yeah sorry man I'm thinking in PHP at the moment.
[19:25:39] <fatguylaughing> crab: gotcha
[19:26:03] <crab> change the show()s to toggle()s, basically
[19:26:10] <fatguylaughing> crab: However, would i use toggle or toggleClass?
[19:26:20] <crab> toggle
[19:26:26] <fatguylaughing> crab: Does toggle just know to show it?
[19:27:15] <fatguylaughing> Well it works :D
[19:27:23] <crab> toggle == if (hidden) {show} else {hide}
[19:27:37] <fatguylaughing> crab: Yeah I'm going to go read the api for it.
[19:27:44] <fatguylaughing> crab shesek thank you both
[19:27:58] <shesek> you're welcome
[19:53:21] <Chomper> PENIS!!!
[20:18:41] <Ambience> I have a very basic question about animate()
[20:18:48] <Ambience> Can somebody give me a hand?
[20:19:14] <shesek> Ambience, just ask, don't ask if you can ask
[20:19:37] <Ambience> ^^;
[20:19:38] <Ambience> :|
[20:20:18] <Ambience> Okay.
[20:20:34] <Ambience> So I want a link to "blink" slowly.
[20:20:59] <Ambience> It works... however for some reason it doubles the milliseconds when repeating
[20:21:02] <Ambience> I'm not sure why
[20:21:36] <Ambience> link.mouseover(animateLink);
[20:21:44] <Ambience> function animateLink()
[20:21:46] <Ambience> {
[20:21:57] <Ambience> $(this).stop();
[20:22:05] <Ambience> $(this).animate({opacity:0.1},750,
[20:22:10] <Ambience> function()
[20:22:13] <Ambience> {
[20:22:22] <Ambience> $(this).animate({opacity:1},750,animateLink);
[20:22:23] <Ambience> }
[20:22:25] <Ambience> );
[20:22:34] <Ambience> }
[20:22:58] <coldhead> cool paste bro

[20:29:01] <b|indMoe> I am creating a way for users to set some form settings based on some pre-defined templates.  Does anyone know of a plugin or method of applying new values to multiple form elements quickly and easily?
[20:30:56] <Stereo> b|indMoe: yeah, I use jQuery :]
[20:31:56] <b|indMoe> hehe I was thinking more of a methodology.. like an array with key.value pairs that matched the element_name.new_value
[20:32:03] <a|i> is there an event that can be invoked when a page is loaded as a result of pressing the browser back/forward button?
[20:32:48] <oojacoboo> a|i: that sounds like a terrible idea
[20:33:11] <Ambience> Okay...
[20:33:32] <Ambience> http://jsfiddle.net/wT6R7/8/
[20:33:33] <Ambience> Can somebody help me with a basic animate() problem?  Thanks
[20:34:02] <Ambience> You'll have to stretch the result to the left a bit....
[20:34:37] <Ambience> Now... The problem is that when the animation repeats it delays twice as long as it should (750ms)
[20:34:47] <Ambience> Should be very simple I just cannot seem to find it
[20:34:50] <Ambience> :(
[20:35:42] <jwm> use mouseenter mouseleave
[20:35:44] <jwm> first of all
[20:35:59] <Ambience> Will do.. Thank
[20:36:00] <Ambience> you
[20:36:43] <jwm> you could also just use show/hide or toggle
[20:36:52] <Ambience> :X
[20:37:01] <jwm> along with hover
[20:37:08] <Ambience> I'm sure i reinvented a lot of built in jquery stuff
[20:37:12] <Ambience> I'm just learning T_T
[20:37:27] <Ambience> okay so I'll look at show/hide and hover
[20:37:31] <Ambience> in the docs
[20:37:31] <Ambience> thx
[20:37:40] <Ambience> but i think it's still an animate() issue
[20:37:41] <jwm> hehe
[20:37:47] <Ambience> and something with recursive / milliseconds
[20:38:20] <jwm> I didn't both reading your problem
[20:38:21] <jwm> heh
[20:38:40] <Axsuul> anyone using jquery outside events plugin?
[20:39:30] <jwm> the drop down menu is the problem?
[20:40:16] <Ambience> :P
[20:40:22] <Ambience> When u hover over the drop down links
[20:40:26] <Ambience> under resources / search
[20:40:33] <Ambience> they blink
[20:40:36] <Ambience> and the animation repeats infinitely till u mouse out
[20:41:06] <Ambience> but for some reason the milliseconds double when it repeats
[20:41:24] <Ambience> http://jsfiddle.net/wT6R7/8/
[20:42:58] <jwm> yeah
[20:43:05] <jwm> you are calling the animateLink function from itself
[20:43:34] <jwm> so that would cause the blinking
[20:43:38] <Ambience> Right
[20:43:41] <Ambience> I want it to blink
[20:43:42] <jwm> and then the event queue is building up
[20:43:50] <Ambience> Ooooooooooo
[20:43:53] <Ambience> so I  need to put another stop
[20:43:55] <Ambience> in
[20:44:06] <jwm> well
[20:44:43] <jwm> did you change it to mouseenter/mouseleave
[20:44:54] <jwm> mouseover/mouseout can fire weirdly
[20:44:56] <Ambience> yea
[20:44:57] <Ambience> I did
[20:44:59] <Ambience> Same result
[20:45:02] <Ambience> :[
[20:45:44] <jwm> you should add jumptoEnd just in case
[20:45:52] <Ambience> mmk
[20:46:39] <jwm> .stop true, true
[20:47:34] <Ambience> lol
[20:47:49] <Ambience> stop(true,true) broke it pretty bad
[20:47:50] <Ambience> I'ma have to experiment
[20:48:01] <Ambience> It also did not fix that recursive timing issue -___-
[20:48:32] <jwm> what version of jquery?
[20:49:18] <Ambience> 1.7
[20:50:08] <jwm> what browser
[20:50:13] <jwm> it seems to work for me
[20:51:32] <Ambience> Chrome
[20:51:34] <Ambience> It works
[20:51:43] <Ambience> As in it functions correctly
[20:51:47] <Ambience> EXCEPT
[20:52:01] <Ambience> If you change the milliseconds to, say, 1500 instead of 750
[20:52:13] <Ambience> you'll notice it doubles the time
[20:52:21] <Ambience> to repeat the animation
[20:52:31] <Ambience> its hard to notice at 750
[20:55:42] <jwm> ohh
[20:56:13] <Ambience> It's really hard to describe...
[20:56:19] <Ambience> Do you see it now ? :)
[20:58:04] <coldhead> can you fix it by making the time half as long?
[20:58:43] <Ambience> No, because then the animation looks wrong
[20:59:08] <Ambience> as in it's too fast
[20:59:15] <Ambience> and the delay is still doubled
[20:59:32] <Ambience> :'(
[20:59:41] <scrandaddy> i'm developing a jquery widget and i've implemented static methods that don't operate on a dom element by adding a traditional plugin to $.myPluginName. is there any built in way to do this with the widget factory?
[21:20:05] <tush> hi friends
[21:20:14] <tush> need some help
[21:20:27] <tush> I am not good at js
[21:20:47] <tush> I am trying to use 1 jquery plugin
[21:21:07] <tush> I am successful in implimenting it
[21:21:25] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:21:25] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[21:21:49] <tush> it is an image slider
[21:22:17] <tush> but it looks bad in browsers other than firefox
[21:22:47] <tush> http://abacaindia.com/wp
[21:23:11] <sonuloveu> good morning jquery
[21:25:03] <Cork> tush: looks like the code for scaling the images fails
[21:25:44] <tush> just take a look at it in firefox
[21:25:47] <tush> and chrome
[21:25:56] <tush> in firefox it looks good
[21:25:57] <Cork> ya, i have
[21:26:19] <Cork> wheres the code that sets the images heights?
[21:27:02] <tush> If you can lead me to the line where I shall make changes it will be gr8 help as I am bad at understanding js
[21:27:32] <tush> I'll try to find it
[21:27:33] <Cork> ah, no its not scaling
[21:27:36] <Cork> its croping
[21:28:41] <Cork> tush: try removin the br's
[21:28:46] <Cork> and correct the html errors
[21:29:01] <tush> ok
[21:29:17] <Cork> like this one <img id="5" src="http://abacaindia.com/wp/wp-content/frontpics/5.jpg" alt="ABACA" width="517" height="340" "/>
[21:29:53] <Cork> w3c validator is your friend ;)
[21:29:55] <Ezek2k4>  i have a row that has an input with an autocomplete (rows are created dynamically) i have another inputin the same row how i could put some info on that row? i mean is there a way toidentify it?
[21:30:14] <Ezek2k4> that input
[21:31:04] <crab> .next('input') or so? depends on how your inputs are laid out. but if you can predict its relationship to the first input, you can use some combination of next/parent/first/last/children/etc. to find it.
[21:31:23] <coldhead> lol laid
[21:31:51] <Cork> the simplest solution is prob nextAll('input[name="name_of_input"]')
[21:32:15] <Ezek2k4> yes actually its two inputs away from the autocomplete1
[21:32:28] <Ezek2k4> inside a tbl row
[21:32:56] <tush> cork: http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/v1-2.htm
[21:33:03] <tush> is what I am using
[21:33:22] <tush> there r many js files
[21:33:41] <tush> need help in finding out the problem
[21:33:47] <Cork> tush: i think your problem is from the html errors
[21:34:02] <Cork> and i gave you what i think is the problem
[21:34:11] <tush> well I am using wordpress
[21:36:22] <Ezek2k4> can i add a class to the field and look for the next input with that class?
[21:36:31] <Cork> yes
[21:36:33] <acidjazz> how do i specify an object key in js from a vriable
[21:36:35] <acidjazz> variable*
[21:36:52] <Cork> object[key] = value
[21:37:11] <acidjazz> what if im in {}
[21:37:15] <acidjazz> cork: 'testing'
[21:37:18] <acidjazz> but cork is a variable
[21:37:26] <Cork> object = {}; object[key] = value
[21:37:33] <Cork> acidjazz: no other way
[21:37:41] <acidjazz> so cant be done in {} eh
[21:37:42] <acidjazz> k
[21:38:16] <shesek> acidjazz, In Coco, you can do {(key): val}
[21:38:35] <shesek> which's translated into an (_ref={}, _ref[key]=val, _ref) expression
[21:40:18] <acidjazz> hmm     params['Urgent' + favors.filters.urgent ? ' *' : ''] = function() { favors.filters.urgent = !favors.filters.urgent; };
[21:40:23] <acidjazz> what is coco
[21:40:44] <Cork> acidjazz: its a javascript pre processor
[21:41:04] <Cork> you compile javascript from a simplified syntax before its sent to the browser
[21:41:51] <shesek> acidjazz, similar (and based on) CoffeeScript, if you know that
[21:42:45] <shesek> (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/, https://github.com/satyr/coco)
[21:43:13] <shesek> I seriously don't understand why would anyone still be writing JavaScript...
[21:43:20] <sonuloveu> how can I update the form fields after submitting the form
[21:43:23] <sonuloveu> using jquery
[21:43:36] <GoSox> does jQuery have a special event for clicking the submit button OR hitting return in a text field...
[21:43:43] <Cork> shesek: i would counter with i don't see why anyone would add server load by using a pre processor
[21:43:48] <Glumb> .submit() afaik
[21:43:59] <GoSox> actually, i don't think it matters since this technical isn't a form, it's just a few random form elements
[21:44:12] <Glumb> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[21:44:51] <shesek> sonuloveu, *after* submitting the form? unless you're submitting it using ajax, the page gets fully refreshed after submitting the form, it makes no sense to do anything to the page after submitting a form
[21:45:27] <shesek> Cork, that "load" is only when you're modifying your source files, which almost doesn't effect production
[21:45:37] <sonuloveu> shesek, I am doing it for magento checkout where its load steps via ajax
[21:45:46] <shesek> the real issue is debugging, but that's about to (hopefully) be fixed with the line map files
[21:45:47] <sonuloveu> and submitting the form without refresh
[21:46:27] <shesek> sonuloveu, well, than, you'd bind to the submit event as you would bind to any other event, and modify the fields like you would normally modify them
[21:46:38] <shesek> there's nothing special about "modifying fields after submitting a form"
[21:47:03] <sonuloveu> yeah, so I would need to do that on external js file or I can do that on html page itself?
[21:47:28] <sonuloveu> when it comes magento it becomes automatic special :D
[21:47:32] <shesek> sonuloveu, there's no difference between the two, but you shouldn't have your HTML markup and JavaScript code mixed up
[21:47:42] <sonuloveu> yeah
[21:48:22] <shesek> Cork, and coffeescript/coco is *much* more than "simplified syntax"
[21:49:28] <Cork> shesek: i know, thats not what i said
[21:51:36] <acidjazz> Cork / shesek whats we/ ppl and pre-processors
[21:51:45] <acidjazz> why write code that writes code that you ultimately have to debug
[21:52:06] <acidjazz> why not just write js and code to get things done not to hope someone sees you coding
[21:52:18] <coldhead> why pay fat men to walk on you in high heels?
[21:52:35] <coldhead> sometimes it just feels right
[21:52:45] <dkog> Can I call .animate() several times in a row to effect a repeated animation?  It seems to work, but I'm not sure if it's supported officially.
[21:52:53] <acidjazz> that makes no sense
[21:54:00] <Cork> dkog: .animate will queue the animations
[21:54:27] <dkog> Cork: But if I animate different properties, they all happen at once?
[21:54:57] <dkog> Or (2) if I animate different elements they all happen at once?
[21:55:22] <acidjazz> everything always happens at once in js unless specified otherwise
[21:55:32] <Cork> dkog: i don't think they would, but not sure
[21:55:58] <Cork> dkog: you can animate multible properties in the same .animate call though
[21:56:44] <acidjazz> i have a js object passing to ajax.php via a jquery $.get and all my true/false values are strings 'true' and 'false'
[21:56:46] <acidjazz> any solution?
[21:58:24] <GoSox> i just spent a lot of time trying to figure out why jQ wasn't working
[21:58:35] <GoSox> before i realized that it wasn't included in this doc :(
[21:59:04] <tush> lease help me solve this
[21:59:06] <acidjazz> so tehyre GEt parameters
[21:59:15] <GoSox> ah, it is included, it just got put in the wrong spot somehow
[21:59:16] <tush> http://abacaindia.com/wp
[22:00:04] <shesek> acidjazz, there's no way to pass booleans in as query string arguments, they must be converted to strings
[22:00:07] <Cork> tush: you still haven't removed the br's
[22:00:10] <shesek> s/in//
[22:00:18] <acidjazz> so shoudl i pass it as encoded json
[22:00:51] <tush> I am not using brs in that code
[22:01:03] <Cork> tush: you do
[22:01:05] <shesek> acidjazz, you can pass it as a JSON-encoded string if you prefer to, than when you'll decode it you'll get actual booleans
[22:01:19] <Cork> you have a <br /> after each img/a combination
[22:01:40] <shesek> but you can simply do that yourself in your PHP, i.e. instead of $bool = $_GET['bool'], do $bool = $_GET['bool'] === 'true'
[22:01:52] <Cork> tush: might be added by how you put your code in wordpress, but it still needs to go
[22:02:26] <tush> http://pastebin.com/HBk7M1d3
[22:02:34] <tush> here is what I have on wp
[22:02:44] <acidjazz> yea shesek but what if i have the rare case where i DO need that as a string
[22:02:59] <acidjazz> so i should conver it to json i guess
[22:03:07] <Cork> tush: what you put in wordpress doesn't really matter, what html it generates do
[22:03:23] <Cork> tush: and the generated html has br's in it
[22:03:25] <Ezek2k4> $('input.amcharge').next().val(datai[0].price); is this syntax correct?
[22:03:27] <shesek> if its meant to be a boolean, there's no reason to prefer having a 'true' string instead of an actual true booleab
[22:03:31] <shesek> s/b$/n
[22:03:32] <tush> but how to control that output
[22:03:41] <tush> cause it's a standard wp
[22:03:57] <tush> it shouldn't be giving br
[22:03:57] <acidjazz> so how do i conver an obj to json in js?
[22:03:59] <Cork> tush: should be an option to not filter the input
[22:04:12] <Cork> acidjazz: JSON.stringify
[22:04:20] <tush> k let me try that
[22:04:22] <acidjazz> JSOn.stringify(obj) ?
[22:04:32] <Cork> JSON, ya
[22:04:36] <shesek> acidjazz, some browsers supports JSON.stringify(object), for others you'll need the json2 library which adds a shim for that
[22:04:56] <shesek> !google json2.js
[22:05:00] <shesek> !g json2.js
[22:05:06] <acidjazz> i have to include more js
[22:05:07] <Cork> ?g json2
[22:05:07] <bot-t> Cork, JSON in JavaScript - http://www.json.org/js.html
[22:05:15] <shesek> yeah, that ^
[22:05:17] <acidjazz> how is this not supported by all browsers now??
[22:05:35] <shesek> acidjazz, I guess you haven't been doing web development for long, huh?
[22:05:36] <Cork> acidjazz: json2 was the library to add json parsing
[22:05:45] <acidjazz> 10+ years
[22:05:46] <Cork> then browsers reimplemented it nativly
[22:06:05] <Cork> old ie's and really old other browsers doesn't have it
[22:06:10] <acidjazz> i wonder if this is really the solution
[22:06:17] <Cork> but if you don't need old browser support you don't need the library
[22:06:19] <acidjazz> looks like crap as get params
[22:06:22] <shesek> acidjazz, than you should know that MANY people uses browsers (*cough* IE *cough*) that have been released over 10 years ago...
[22:06:39] <acidjazz> oh i thought u meant some browsers to date
[22:06:59] <shesek> no, Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Opera have been supporting that for quite long
[22:07:02] <shesek> and IE9+ IIRC
[22:07:12] <shesek> or was it 8? not sure
[22:07:26] <Cork> ie7 has it
[22:07:33] <Cork> ie6 doesn't
[22:07:35] <shesek> ?g quirksmore json.stringify

[22:09:06] <tush> http://abacaindia.com/wp/
[22:09:21] <tush> I used a plugin to use raw html
[22:09:30] <Cork> :)
[22:09:41] <tush> now there is only one issue left the white space on top
[22:10:10] <tush> I think I'll get over it by modifieng  css
[22:10:32] <tush> I spent 2 nights solving this
[22:10:35] <tush> thanks a ton
[22:10:58] <Cork> tush: prob the <p></p> at the top of the slider
[22:11:43] <Cork> yup
[22:11:53] <shesek> Cork, It was added on IE8, not 7, http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/09/10/native-json-in-ie8.aspx
[22:12:21] <Cork> shesek: ie7 works fine here without json2 though
[22:12:43] <shesek> weird... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc836459%28VS.85%29.aspx also says "Supported in the following document modes: Internet Explorer 8 standards, Internet Explorer 9 standards. See Version Information."
[22:15:59] <GoSox> is != how you do 'not equal to' in js?
[22:16:14] <Cork> != or !== ya
[22:16:18] <ChristianJ> !== is better
[22:16:25] <Cork> depending what you want to test
[22:16:28] <GoSox> ok i thought so but sometimes i get a little confused
[22:16:33] <shesek> GoSox, != is how you do 'buggy, weird, shouldn't be used not equal to' in js
[22:16:33] <GoSox> i'm testing a number
[22:16:57] <ChristianJ> != is type agnostic
[22:16:59] <Cork> shesek: its not bugy in any way
[22:17:07] <Cork> !== is just type checking
[22:17:12] <ChristianJ> !== must be not the same type
[22:17:13] <Cork> else it does the same as !=
[22:17:30] <ChristianJ> == and === are similar but opposite
[22:17:32] <GoSox> (string.length != 5)  // doesn't see how i could ever go wrong with != here
[22:17:34] <shesek> Cork, yeah, I know, its behavior is known and predictable - but still, it shouldn't be used
[22:17:54] <ChristianJ> !== is faster due to less boxing
[22:18:03] <GoSox> oh?
[22:18:06] <Cork> shesek: sometimes its exactly whats wanted
[22:18:09] <GoSox> well speed is tempting
[22:18:12] <Cork> yup
[22:18:37] <shesek> Cork, that's correct, but its really rare that you really want that
[22:18:39] <ChristianJ> since you know .length emits an int, then compare it directly to an int and use !==
[22:19:10] <ChristianJ> jslint will tell you to use !==
[22:19:31] <Cork> jslint isn't always right though
[22:19:42] <Cork> but in this case, its often a good idea
[22:19:46] <shesek> Cork, since working with coffeescript (which compiles [!=]= as [!=]==) I've had a really few cases where I needed the behavior of ==
[22:20:05] <GoSox> behavior wise, i see nothing wrong at all using != in the way i was using it
[22:20:20] <Cork> there isn't
[22:20:21] <GoSox> but if !== is faster, faster always wins :D
[22:20:34] <ChristianJ> you are right, there is nothing wrong with it
[22:20:38] <Cork> most of the time the speed difference has no meaning what so ever
[22:20:47] <ChristianJ> but there is something more right :)
[22:20:47] <GoSox> if a billion people load this page, i could save the world a pound of coal :P
[22:20:54] <Cork> not really
[22:21:10] <ragas> Can i directly set an arbitrary style attribute using a jQ identifier?  $('#foo').style='color:blue'; ??
[22:21:12] <shesek> Cork, speed difference means a lot when you're using javascript on server-side
[22:21:18] <ChristianJ> all hail PHP for the coal burners!
[22:21:21] <Cork> shesek: i said most of the time
[22:21:29] <GoSox> php <3
[22:21:32] <Cork> shesek: as in for where most ppl write js for
[22:22:10] <shesek> ragas, $(..)[0].style=..
[22:22:12] <ChristianJ> If for no other reason, use !== to shut jslint up.
[22:22:17] <crab> ragas: $(...)[0].style = ...
[22:22:29] <Cork> shesek: if your writing an emulator in js then YES ==  vs === matters a lot
[22:22:53] <crab> what on earth is [!=]==?
[22:22:53] <Cork> shesek: if your counting the number of characters in an input field to make sure its < 10 and > 8, then no it doesnät
[22:22:56] <Cork> *doens't
[22:23:12] <Cork> crab: miss formated regex :)
[22:23:20] <shesek> its not a matter of speed tho, its a matter of unexpected behavior
[22:23:49] <Cork> shesek: there isn't normally any unexpected behaviors
[22:24:06] <Cork> and === has unexpectensis just like == just in the other direction
[22:24:10] <GoSox> so i think the != / !== topic has been exhausted
[22:24:22] <GoSox> i'm fairly sorry i even asked at this point :P
[22:24:24] <ChristianJ> so am I :)
[22:24:27] <Cork> situations where it looks like the data is the same type, but isn't really
[22:24:32] <Ezek2k4> $("input.amcharge").next().val('test2'); why this doesnt works and this does.. $("input.amcharge").val('test');  but im trying to find the next val
[22:24:59] <Ezek2k4> next input with that class i mean
[22:25:00] <shesek> Ezek2k4, console.log($("input.amcharge").next()) will probably tell you what's wrong
[22:25:19] <shesek> that's not what next() does
[22:25:32] <shesek> if you want to second input with that class, use input.amcharge:eq(1) instead
[22:25:54] <shesek> Cork, "situations where it looks like the data is the same type, but isn't really"? example?
[22:26:10] <GoSox> string.length.asStr()
[22:26:27] <Cork> shesek: ugg i don't have it in my head or at hand
[22:26:43] <Cork> shesek: but it comes from the fact that js isn't a typed language
[22:26:57] <Cork> so some of the native functions returns different types
[22:28:28] <Ezek2k4> hmmm so i cant use next to find the next ex: input field? i mean i have dynamic created inputs and when i change 1 i need to find the one that has that class in the same row so basycally the next one?
[22:29:03] <Cork> Ezek2k4: .next() looks at the next sibling in the dom
[22:29:41] <Ezek2k4> then its supposed to do the job?
[22:29:49] <shesek> regardless of its classes, e.g. <a class="b"></a><div></div><a class="b"></a>, $('.b').next() // the <div> element
[22:29:55] <Cork> from what you said, yes it looks like it
[22:30:04] <shesek> * class
[22:30:29] <shesek> or more precisely, regardless of the original selector you used
[22:30:40] <Cork> Ezek2k4: but it only looks at the direct sibling, if you want to look at following, you want nextAll
[22:31:00] <Ezek2k4> ah ok
[22:31:10] <Ezek2k4> that was the problem :)
[22:31:14] <Ezek2k4> ill try it ty
[22:31:23] <Cork> like $('input:first').nextAll('input:first')
[22:31:45] <Cork> (that would be really bad code, but it works as an example ;P)
[22:32:04] <Ezek2k4> it gonna find a class?
[22:32:19] <Ezek2k4> like next input with class x
[22:32:22] <Cork> nextAll works like .find
[22:32:30] <Cork> its css selectors
[22:32:31] <Ezek2k4> ok
[22:32:54] <Cork> it doesn't look in children to siblings though
[22:34:20] <Ezek2k4> not working :( $("input.amcharge").nextAll().val('test2');
[22:34:42] <Cork> Ezek2k4: could you pb the generated html structure?
[22:35:00] <Ezek2k4> sure
[22:35:04] <Cork> its quite hard to say what you need without knowing what the structure is
[22:38:01] <ragas> thanks cork; didnt work, but i got around it.
[22:38:40] <Cork> ragas: that was crab
[22:38:50] <Cork> didn't even see your question
[22:39:29] <Cork> ragas: anyway the answer to your question is use .css
[22:39:52] <Cork> $(selector).css({ 'color': 'blue' })
[22:40:09] <box> I have "jQuery("form.registerinterest").submit(function(){" which submits a form via POST then updates a div with its status. This can take anything up to 5-10 seconds and it's causing my users to click it several times which conflicts with security measures on the site. How do I update a the div as soon as the buttons clicked?
[22:40:17] <ragas> ok, so my thankyou was correct ;)
[22:40:25] <Cork> lol
[22:41:20] <Cork> box: the submit event is called before the post happens
[22:41:38] <Cork> box: so if you modify the div the first thing you do, it should work just fine
[22:42:00] <box> Cork ahh ok thanks bro
[22:42:05] <Cork> np
[22:44:04] <shesek> box, $('form.foo').submit(function(){$(this).find('[type=submit]').attr('disabled',true);})
[22:44:37] <box> that will come in handy too, thanks
[22:50:56] <sasori> hi, is there anyone of you who has the same problem as mine, wherein, the jquery calendar keeps on popping on IE browser, even after user has already selected a date from the calendar ?
[22:51:03] <sasori> any solutions for that?
[22:54:11] <crab> don't use IE, and/or don't select dates ;-) (no, i haven't had that problem)
[22:54:42] <crab> i've had the opposite problem, where it didn't pop up at all, but i think that was not jquery-ui's fault, i think the .js file didn't get fully loaded when they hit esc or something like that.
[22:54:49] <Ezek2k4> http://jsfiddle.net/wMR8G/ heres the structure cork
[22:55:19] <Cork> ah
[22:55:52] <Ezek2k4> when i change something in mamose i want to change the value of the next amount_charge
[22:57:51] <Cork> Ezek2k4: you want $(this).parent().nextAll().find('input')
[22:58:09] <Cork> the inputs arn't siblings
[22:58:41] <Cork> btw a sidenote, [] isn't valid in id's
[22:58:52] <Ezek2k4> yes a mistake :)
[22:59:40] <Ezek2k4> so adding a class to that input is useless?
[22:59:44] <Eiler> when i click a button i want to put text in several html controls, now i do for example: function x{$.post('data.php', {name: names }, function(output){$('textarea').val(output).show();});}} and in the data.php i do echo "."; that prints it in the textarea, but how would i print text in several controls?
[23:00:54] <Cork> Ezek2k4: you could have a cache with the selected inputs
[23:01:02] <Cork> and work from that instead
[23:01:49] <Ezek2k4> hidden field?
[23:02:09] <Cork> var fields = $('input');
[23:02:31] <Ezek2k4> ah and it will works if i add rows dynamically?
[23:02:34] <Cork> fields.eq(<ex. row>).val()
[23:02:36] <Glumb> is there any difference using ' or "?
[23:02:55] <shesek> Glumb, other than not having to escape " inside of ' and vice-versa, no
[23:02:56] <Cork> Ezek2k4: no then you would have to either push them to the array
[23:03:10] <Cork> Ezek2k4: or select a new one when its updated
[23:03:10] <Glumb> oh..
[23:03:15] <Glumb> easier to do it with ' then
[23:03:20] <Ezek2k4> i c
[23:03:25] <Ezek2k4> ill try it ty
[23:03:57] <Glumb> er, nevermind what i said.
[23:04:28] <yamahaalex37>  are there any premade google map embed alternatives
[23:04:35] <yamahaalex37> i find the buttons getting in my way on a 180x180 embed
[23:04:59] <Cork> Ezek2k4: an examle of what i meant: $('input.amcharge').eq($(this).parent().index()+1)
[23:07:28] <Glumb> im trying to change the content of a div with $("div.floater").html(), it works, but if i do it for another div named content with $("div.content"), it doesn't: the structure is like <div class="floater"><div class="content"></div></div>, anyone knows what's wrong?
[23:14:20] <JoeCoolDesk> Hello friends.
[23:14:37] <JoeCoolDesk> If a post request hits a redirect, how do you actually redirect the browser?
[23:16:50] <box> Can someone help me with line 18? http://pastebin.com/Rr3hZ1x4 - this is the part that should re enable the submit button. I've tried the attributes disabled:disabled, disabled:false, enabled:true, enabled:enabled
[23:17:30] <JoeCoolDesk> I'm trying to implement openID snd such which requires redirection as part of the routine.
[23:18:23] <Cork> box: removeAttr('disabled')
[23:19:44] <box> Cork: thanks
[23:19:46] <box> seems to simple
[23:22:08] <randomnamn> I'm trying to implement a restart function, which is when you're clicking on a button a request will be sent to another .php file on the same domain, where it is validated, and then sent to the external server where I want the server to restart from a .bat file, for example. I've written some code, but it isn't working properly. Help would be appreciated!
[23:34:29] <Ezek2k4> is there a way to find this tr id?
[23:34:55] <anli_> Putting id on tr? Why
[23:35:48] <Ezek2k4> im a little confused i tried something and it didnt works well or i didnt understaind very well so im trying something else :)
[23:36:02] <Ezek2k4> i mean i have dynamic rows with inputs
[23:36:18] <anli_> Aha, and you want the closest tr then?
[23:36:26] <Ezek2k4> nope
[23:36:40] <Ezek2k4> im going to give tr's an id and then i can do like
[23:37:06] <Ezek2k4> 'idoftheinput'+thistrid
[23:37:10] <anli_> But to give a tr an id is not a description of a task
[23:37:19] <Ezek2k4> so it will be like name1, name2 , name3
[23:37:20] <anli_> what you want to accomplish
[23:37:20] <Ezek2k4> etc
[23:37:49] <Ezek2k4> i wanna be able to select dynamic inputs by their id
[23:38:29] <anli_> What about selecting them by their index?
[23:38:46] <Ezek2k4> what you mean?
[23:38:53] <anli_> The 3rd tr for instance
[23:40:33] <Ezek2k4> i have this input on each row ex :  inputName3,  when i change inputName3 it will change the value of inputLast3
[23:41:43] <Ezek2k4> so how u can do that
[23:42:13] <anli_> Aha
[23:42:21] <anli_> So there are two inputs on each tr?
[23:42:56] <Ezek2k4> well more than 2 but i only wanna make changes to these 2
[23:42:59] <randomnamn> I'm trying to do something with JQuery and AJAX, I'm on a php page which sends a request to another php page on the same domain, On the other domain I want a function to happen whenever it get's called upon, and I can't find any examples of that task. Help is appreciated.
[23:43:20] <randomnamn> And then it returns the output back to the first php page
[23:43:51] <anli_> Aha, then I would use input.closest('tr').find('input').val(input.val());
[23:44:32] <anli_> Assuming that all inputs in the tr should be given that value
[23:45:11] <anli_> And that the variable input is a jquery object refering to one input
[23:45:25] <Ezek2k4> nope only inputLast3 will change
[23:45:32] <Ezek2k4> when i change inputName3
[23:45:39] <anli_> Aha, then I would use input.closest('tr').find('input:last').val(input.val());
[23:46:02] <anli_> You never need to use ids for this
[23:46:34] <Ezek2k4>  $(this).input.closest('tr').find('input:last').val(input.val());?
[23:46:47] <GoSox> is there a syntax error here i'm not seeing? http://pastebin.com/5Yt6uWej
[23:46:54] <anli_> What is this?
[23:46:59] <GoSox> the first hide runs, and the html runs, but the show and play to not run
[23:47:06] <anli_> Ezek2k4: May be like you write
[23:47:18] <Ezek2k4> ok :) ill try it
[23:47:19] <anli_> oops
[23:47:21] <anli_> no wait
[23:47:23] <Ezek2k4> k
[23:47:39] <anli_> Which handler do you do this in?
[23:48:09] <ragas> Im messing around in the console, and Ive found this command: "delete node" can i do that programmatically?
[23:48:15] <Ezek2k4> actually its inside a autcomplete
[23:48:21] <anli_> aha, nice
[23:48:32] <anli_> var input = $(this); input.closest('tr').find('input:last').val(input.val());
[23:49:34] <Akshey> I want to have range slider widget which can allow any number of range sliders(may vary from 3-6). I am looking for something like this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/range.html but this one has only 2 range sliders.  Is there any plugin which allows more than 2-3 sliders? If not, how can I make one easily?
[23:49:46] <Eiler> i have <script type="text/javascript">function x{} function y{} </script> when i add function y like that the whole javascript stops working how come?
[23:50:04] <JoeCoolDesk> You know, I could just resubmit the form outside of the ajax context if the error code is like a 302.
[23:50:10] <JoeCoolDesk> How do I do that?
[23:51:12] <ChristianJ> Eiler: do you have some missing semicolons?
[23:52:08] <ragas> NM, duh
[23:54:46] <Eiler> do i need to separate the functions with semicolons?
[23:56:30] <Eiler> aha
[23:56:40] <Glumb> function x() {} function y() {}
[23:57:42] <coldhead> you can't have too many semicolons, really
