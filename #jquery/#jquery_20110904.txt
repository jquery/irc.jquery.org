[00:10:08] <SvcGhost> Hey guys, what's a good way to diagnose this issue? A little window on a page opens upon loading the page only through my proxy web server. It doesn't open when viewing the page on a normal browser though
[00:10:25] <SvcGhost> I know it's JavaScript or jQuery doing it because when I disable javascript, it doesn't pop up
[00:10:53] <SvcGhost> There is a lot of code to sort through so I can't look through it all. It'd be much faster if there was a tool I can use to figure out why it's popping up only when viewed through the proxy web server
[00:27:49] <IanWizard-XChat> Hey all :)
[00:28:56] <IanWizard-XChat> Is there a workaround for how jquery-ui modals, disable the scroll bars on chrome / safari / webkit?
[00:32:16] <coldhead> SvcGhost: maybe you can set a breakpoint in chrome?
[00:36:19] <SvcGhost> is that an extension coldhead
[00:37:29] <coldhead> no, chrome's debugger is pretty advanced
[00:37:58] <coldhead> i don't know for sure, i'm just suggesting that's a promising line of enquiry
[00:40:06] <coldhead> this looks like it might work, let me try for you SvcGhost
[00:42:56] <SvcGhost> my site is local tho
[00:42:59] <SvcGhost> can't give u link
[00:43:21] <coldhead> i am writing some code for you
[00:43:25] <coldhead> i give YOU link
[00:45:13] <jrockjiggz> i made a cool little experiment with animation for fun  http://www.dygmm.com/jerome/moshumi%20apu/index.html
[00:45:52] <coldhead> SvcGhost: http://jsfiddle.net/Mth4k/ try something like this in your code
[00:49:57] <SvcGhost> Thank u coldhead
[00:49:59] <SvcGhost> ur very nice
[01:08:19] <kmurph79> i'm doing a $("#thing").text()    multiple times, but it keeps returning the first cached value.  how would i enable it to fetch the value anew on each .text() call?
[01:10:47] <kmurph79> the #thing is a text area, whose value is constantly changing
[01:15:18] <kmurph79> nevermind, need to use val() on a textarea not text()
[02:04:10] <dotjs> Hi
[02:08:15] <Kichael> How would I use the .live to trigger a function call when a user select an option in a drop down?

[04:42:36] <larsemil> $('#slide').show("fast"); slides the content in from the right, how can i make it slide from the left instead?
[04:49:21] <Zer0Thunder> anyone for my question ?
[04:52:00] <Zer0Thunder> hello could somebody help me out here , I'm working a website which needs a Round Menu and submenus inside that around menu , kinda exact like google circle . well I googled about it . all I was able find this wounder circle animation
[04:52:04] <Zer0Thunder> does anybody have any idea how to do that ?
[04:55:09] <ravenzz> Zer0Thunder http://www.webgeekly.com/tutorials/how-to-create-the-google-circles-effect-with-css-jquery/
[04:55:09] <ravenzz> ?
[04:55:45] <ravenzz> anyway i think that google is doing that in css3
[04:55:50] <muzone> At my megamenu at http://jsfiddle.net/gRFmd/ - why when you go to the first Item and hover the links under "Some headline", and then move your mouse, say to the picture, why does the links disappear?
[04:58:25] <larsemil> $('#slide').show("fast"); slides the content in from the right, how can i make it slide from the left instead?
[05:01:06] <Zer0Thunder> ravenzz:  the problem is the little rounds inside the menu . thats what I want .
[05:01:13] <Zer0Thunder> yea I saw this btw :/
[05:02:13] <Zer0Thunder> inside the circle *
[05:03:13] <Zer0Thunder> ravenzz: anyidea how to do that ?
[05:03:24] <muzone> is hoverIntent still the way to go?
[05:05:38] <ravenzz> Zer0Thunder no, i should think about that
[05:05:44] <ravenzz> but i am busy right now
[05:18:18] <muzone> At my mega drop down menu at http://jsfiddle.net/vTZ3W/ - is there anything you'd do different? Got my inspiration from http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/mega-drop-downs-w-css-jquery/
[05:23:37] <Kaapa> muzone: i'd make the first level not move
[05:23:44] <Kaapa> muzone: but looking good
[05:24:29] <muzone> Kaapa: Thanks man
[05:24:40] <muzone> Yeah I'm trying to make the first level not move, not sure how to do it though
[05:25:04] <muzone> Also, is hoverIntent being applied the right way?
[05:30:09] <Zer0Thunder> I have done the cirecle the way here they have mentioned ,http://www.webgeekly.com/tutorials/how-to-create-the-google-circles-effect-with-css-jquery/  but can't seems to get the little around button inside the middle layor to work :(
[05:30:20] <Zer0Thunder> anyone have a idea ?
[05:33:55] <eml> Anyone know of a good jquery plugin for vertical scrollers?
[05:34:03] <muzone> Kaapa you there man?
[05:39:04] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/vTZ3W/2/ - why won't hoverIntent work?
[05:40:05] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[05:55:24] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/vTZ3W/8/ - why won't hoverIntent work?
[05:55:41] <jamov> muzone, try this url for your script: http://home.no/mritz/jquery_hoverintent_r6.min.js
[05:55:49] <jamov> the one you got -> 404
[05:56:21] <muzone> haaaaaaaaaa
[05:56:27] <muzone> thanks jamov :)
[05:57:00] <muzone> jamov: still though I dont see a delay in the dropdowns: http://jsfiddle.net/vTZ3W/9/
[06:02:20] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/vTZ3W/9/ - why won't hoverIntent work?
[06:03:30] <larsemil> so i use ajax to load a page, and that page loads a javascript that kind of ruins my script currently running on page. How do i get around that?
[06:11:43] <muzone> At my mega drop down menu at http://jsfiddle.net/GLDTJ/ - is there anything I can do to simplify / improve it?
[06:24:29] <larsemil> can i prevent js to load on pages loaded with ajax?
[06:33:50] <cole_gillespie> larsemil, sure if you want your page to fail
[06:36:07] <ryankask> hey all. I have an element that has "display: none" ... I want it to "slideDown" but with "display: block" instead of "display: inline", which is currently happening
[06:36:17] <ryankask> how do I do this?
[06:37:51] <Woet> ryankask: by using the correct html
[06:38:09] <Woet> ryankask: if you want it to be display: inline, use the element that is display: inline; by default
[06:38:13] <Woet> e.g. a span instead of a div
[06:39:17] <ryankask> okay yea i need it to be the other way around... so a div instead of a span
[06:39:17] <ryankask> thanks!
[06:39:25] <Woet> :)
[06:43:15] <fris> im using a keypress event sequence, how would i go about loading an image with al ightbox on this sequence. would load be the best way? or is a better option available
[06:53:09] <larsemil> cole_gillespie: how do i do that then? thing is i am jusing jquery as a control for a slideshow, and when i load a new page, it loads the order again and screws it up.
[07:03:04] <Sky[x]> i need jqury plugin for checkbox like here ? http://lipidity.com/fancy-form/#example
[07:03:28] <larsemil> Sky[x]: that can be done with css only
[07:03:52] <larsemil> atleast checkbox part
[07:03:57] <Sky[x]> tis example is made with mootols :)
[07:04:02] <larsemil> i can see that
[07:04:45] <larsemil> Sky[x]: what i mean is: theese squares are also checkboxes and they are only css styled. http://labs.daladevelop.se/dddrumr/
[07:07:43] <cole_gillespie> larsemil, i would have to see your code
[07:07:45] <Brammm> OH HAI THERE
[07:08:20] <Brammm> I'm using $(window).keydown to catch left/right arrow presses for a little image scroller
[07:08:32] <Brammm> works great, but now I'm also using fancybox, which also uses left and right key presses
[07:08:45] <Brammm> is there any way to stop my script from scrolling when fancybox is open?
[07:11:31] <alexi5> hello
[07:13:51] <KyouJin-SaMa> hello
[07:13:59] <larsemil> cole_gillespie: hang on

[07:14:31] <KyouJin-SaMa> is there a jquery plugin to that trick?
[07:14:36] <larsemil> cole_gillespie: https://github.com/larsemil/lepres/blob/master/controls.js
[07:22:58] <StPiere> im trying example from this page , http://danwebb.net/2008/2/3/how-to-use-low-pro-for-jquery but am getting error : cannot call method addClass of undefined .. any help ?
[07:23:21] <StPiere> this.element should be the dollar signed element
[07:25:40] <StPiere> anyone ??
[07:28:16] <StPiere> somehow this loses its reference outside initialize
[07:40:26] <Sprintfox> tfox
[08:40:33] <Putr> is there a "the preferred way" of validating forms with jquery? a plugin maby?
[08:41:46] <Woet> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[08:42:04] <Putr> thanks Woet
[08:42:06] <Woet> always validate server-side too, obviously.
[08:42:33] <Putr> Woet: that's already done, but the plugin i'm using (not the one you showed me) sux
[08:44:16] <MatBoy> is someone willing to check why this ugly script (at the moment) does not resize or opening the new window my messages ? (missing image there atm) http://www.macare.nl/ajtest/cm_home.php
[08:45:09] <Woet> ?demo @ MatBoy
[08:45:10] <bot-t> MatBoy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:45:28] <MatBoy> Woet: I have one in the link.... I can try to upload it there... is it needed ?
[08:45:43] <Woet> MatBoy: "with instructions on how to reproduce the issue."
[08:46:00] <Woet> "not resize or opening the new window my messages" - not making any sense to me
[08:46:12] <MatBoy> Woet: the issue is that the maximize does not work... and the "new message" neither...
[08:46:21] <MatBoy> it's a link in the demo
[08:46:41] <Woet> and have you looked at your javascript console?
[08:46:45] <Woet> the error is quite obvious
[08:46:51] <Woet> ?debug @ MatBoy
[08:46:51] <bot-t> MatBoy, Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[08:47:16] <StPiere> anyone familiar with jQuery low port pro ?
[08:47:37] <MatBoy> Woet: yes, using FB already... cannot find it exactly
[08:47:51] <Woet> MatBoy: you can't find the error or you can't find the cause of the error?
[08:49:36] <MatBoy> Woet:cannot find what causes it... I know this one should work normally
[08:50:05] <Woet> MatBoy: what is the error you are getting?
[08:50:09] <Woet> besides the flood of 404's
[08:51:13] <angvent> I am using a plugin that says it has some event hooks... how do I "hook" to the events?   http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[08:51:25] <Woet> angvent: .bind usuaully
[08:51:28] <Woet> usually *
[08:51:31] <MatBoy> Woet: yes the 404's are because I ripped it out of a larger version to strip it down...
[08:52:11] <StPiere> anyone has any idea why this doesnt work http://pastebin.com/53ZKPfAL ?
[08:52:19] <Woet> MatBoy: okay, so which JS error are you getting when clicking maximize?
[08:52:57] <MatBoy> Woet: for the new message, firebug tells me the page is loaded... but it does not show up as a jquery based div... now for the maximize... I have to copy it from FB... just a sec... I think it has something to do with each other where it uses the same function
[08:53:30] <MatBoy> Woet: Effect.Shrink(alt1, {direction: 'center'}); is not defined
[08:53:44] <Woet> MatBoy: so, what could be the cause of that?
[08:54:28] <Woet> MatBoy: besides the fact that you are in a jQuery channel while using prototype and scriptaculous :)
[08:56:18] <MatBoy> Woet: that os what I'm trying to find out :)
[08:56:30] <Woet> MatBoy: make a guess
[08:58:27] <cesconix> <ul> <li>foo</li> <li>bar</li> /ul> <--- problem: in my $('ul', this).delegate('li', 'click', function(){ // how can i get the 'li' number? });
[08:59:07] <TrueColors> Okay so I have an element which has some form fields in ... what's the simplest way to loop through each one?
[08:59:32] <MatBoy> Woet: it's a standard "thingy" so I thought that it doesn't depends on some var or whatever
[08:59:56] <TrueColors> I can do... $("form input, form select").each ...
[08:59:57] <TrueColors> uhm
[09:00:15] <Woet> MatBoy: why did you join #jquery with your problem?
[09:01:00] <MatBoy> Woet: because people here are wider in dev
[09:01:09] <TrueColors> wait...
[09:02:17] <Woet> MatBoy: you use prototype but ask jQuery for help?
[09:02:56] <MatBoy> Woet: I could use a forum.. hence is that the discussion ?
[09:03:07] <Woet> MatBoy: i have no idea what you're trying to say
[09:03:18] <Woet> but a) your problem is obvious b) you're in #jquery asking for help with prototype
[09:03:30] <Woet> try #javascript and/or #prototype
[09:03:33] <TrueColors> doesn't jquery have a prototype feature thing?
[09:03:44] <MatBoy> Woet: I can use prototype ? OK :)
[09:03:56] <MatBoy> Woet: or would you suggest to use another language ?
[09:04:06] <Woet> language? these are frameworks
[09:04:10] <wookiehangover> thats a framework, not a language
[09:04:36] <Woet> but you can use vbscript instead of javascript
[09:04:37] <Woet> if you insist
[09:04:42] <Woet> vbscript is fun!
[09:04:44] <MatBoy> Woet: yeah ok
[09:04:53] <MatBoy> nah... vbscript... since when >
[09:05:06] <MatBoy> 1995 ;)
[09:05:13] <Woet> it works! sometimes.
[09:06:29] <Woet> MatBoy: so, any idea what an error "<some function> is not defined" could indicate?
[09:08:15] <MatBoy> Woet: the function is not there
[09:08:19] <MatBoy> or not found
[09:08:28] <Woet> MatBoy: great! so what could cause that?
[09:09:17] <MatBoy> Woet: depends on... did I remove the file, did I remove the fuction, did I never add it ?
[09:09:43] <Woet> MatBoy: all 3 possible, all 3 the same solution
[09:09:45] <Woet> :)
[09:09:51] <kaolti> Hi Guys
[09:10:00] <MatBoy> Woet: that was not your question ;)
[09:10:21] <Woet> MatBoy: ?
[09:10:28] <MatBoy> Woet: but could it be that it's the same reason for the "new" popup ?
[09:10:40] <Woet> MatBoy: does it give the sam error?
[09:10:41] <Woet> same *
[09:10:43] <kaolti> I want to select the first and last child of EVERY ul in a container
[09:10:52] <kaolti> :last and :first doesn't work for me
[09:11:13] <MatBoy> Woet: true
[09:11:19] <Woet> ?demo @ kaolti
[09:11:19] <bot-t> kaolti, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:11:25] <Woet> MatBoy: then the same solution most likely applies
[09:11:35] <Woet> MatBoy: you named 3 possible causes, all with the same solution - so implement that solution
[09:13:10] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/GWAjD/1/ basically, all these fields are required. I want to loop through all the required fields by their class name, if the the value is empty, or an option is not selected etc... to display an alert.
[09:13:11] <cesconix> There is a method that returns the item number (<li>) in a list (<ul>)?
[09:13:13] <TrueColors> else go with the submit.
[09:13:18] <TrueColors> is there a way to do that? it doesn't seem to be working for me.
[09:13:45] <kaolti> http://jsfiddle.net/DApSq/ here is the working example
[09:14:28] <cesconix> is there a method that returns the item number (<li>) in a list (<ul>)?
[09:14:45] <kaolti> i tried with first() and last() as well
[09:14:48] <kaolti> doesn't work
[09:16:15] <MatBoy> Woet: yes but I have to find where it is... there is a working version that lacks in coding ! so I need to digg :)
[09:18:02] <danzik17> TrueColors: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/GWAjD/2/
[09:18:06] <Woet> kaolti: what are you trying to do?
[09:18:20] <Woet> kaolti: you need to use .each cause you have multiple classes and your css wont work
[09:18:43] <Woet> kaolti: and i guess you want to avoid double borders, so you have to remove border-top for :last and border-bottom for :first - not the other way
[09:19:25] <TrueColors> that looks good danzik17, what does e.stopPropagation(); do?
[09:19:29] <kaolti> yea the double border is no prob, will look up how each would work
[09:19:30] <kaolti> thanks
[09:20:00] <danzik17> TrueColors: Stops event bubbling.  You don't actually need it there and can remove it - was doing it a different way at first and forgot about it.
[09:20:18] <TrueColors> event bubbling? what do you mean?
[09:21:03] <wookiehangover> ?event bubbling
[09:21:03] <bot-t> How event bubbling works: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[09:21:11] <wookiehangover> BOOM
[09:25:14] <kaolti> Woet can you take a look please? http://jsfiddle.net/DApSq/1/
[09:25:29] <MatBoy> Woet: found it, thanks! I need to clean up this code from this guy... he is working with a download with src in it :S
[09:25:44] <Woet> MatBoy: yay!
[09:25:45] <kaolti> now the css should be applied to each first li, right?
[09:25:55] <Woet> kaolti: no, one moment
[09:26:17] <Woet> kaolti: http://jsfiddle.net/DApSq/3/
[09:26:50] <kaolti> Woet: yay, thanks :D
[09:28:28] <danzik17> kaolti: That can be simplified to http://jsfiddle.net/DApSq/4/
[09:28:43] <Woet> thanks danzik17 :)
[09:29:57] <kaolti> awesome
[09:34:42] <Tijn> Hi. I have a simple question; what is the prefered naming convention for options in jQuery plugins? like_this, likeThis, 'like-this' or LikeThis?
[09:47:44] <cole_gillespie> does anyone here use gedit?
[09:48:05] <TrueColors> Danzik17, for example if I had a drop down with two options... "Select One" and "Apple", Select One, would be classed as an empty field. How would you verify that?
[09:48:14] <TrueColors> It could have a value of -1 or 0... or whatever what people use but..
[09:48:55] <TrueColors> yeah, would it just be...  if ( $(this).val() === '' || $(this).val() === "-1" ) {
[09:48:56] <TrueColors> though..
[09:49:05] <TrueColors> someone could input -1 into a field (lets say it was a valid value for one of them)
[09:49:15] <TrueColors> it would still be classed as empty when I only want it to work like that for dropdowns..
[09:49:22] <TrueColors> if you get what I mean.
[09:50:26] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/GWAjD/5/ for instance like that drop down.
[09:52:17] <Putr> is there a "the preferred way" of adding date input fields to html5 date fields?
[10:22:32] <flayks> hey
[10:24:25] <flayks> in your opinion, how can i make a home made panorama of 65000px of width splitted in ~70 images ? like a timeline i think... but i don't know how to beginning the code
[10:31:37] <dabear> flayks: you can stack all images in succession, bind to the scroll event on a container div, and use the this.scrollWidth to find out if the div is scrolled to the far right
[10:32:05] <dabear> when that happens, you can take the first image of the container and append it to the end of the container etc
[10:32:56] <flayks> dabear: yep i thought about it but in my div, images are in float left
[10:33:47] <flayks> so, i have to set the total width of all images to the container div, you see?
[10:34:49] <dabear> flayks: if you don't know how to do this, try looking at other implementations
[10:34:52] <dabear> for example http://www.rockechris.com/jquery/jquery.panorer.js.html
[10:35:11] <dabear> or http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery.panorama/
[10:39:11] <flayks> dabear: yep i saw these links but in the idea, it's like a timeline (see http://jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/scrollable-timelines.html#2007-google-code-jam-latin-america) or this http://jqueryfordesigners.com/slider-gallery/
[10:39:57] <thrall> Hi. What is a good way to escape strings returned by for example an ajax query?
[10:40:39] <dabear> thrall: depends. usually you do ajax requests against sites you thrust, and then it shouldn't be any problem
[10:40:56] <dabear> however, you can use $("#foo").text(data)
[10:41:05] <dabear> and then it wouldn't do any harm to your page
[10:42:18] <thrall> dabear: Okay, thank you. That is helpful.
[10:57:02] <a|i> given a sorted set mapped to a list of DOMs, what's a good way of adding a new member to the DOM list by jquery? using append() or prepend() simply adds to the start or end of the list, how to add a new member to the right place inside the list by jquery?
[11:17:57] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/PQEq2/3/ - when you hover the first item - why won't the border stretch all the way down on the last column?
[11:18:01] <muzone> Do I need JS for this?
[11:24:00] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[11:25:58] <Duckpaste> The border doesnt stretch to the bottom, because the ul doesnt stretch to the bottom, play around with the height css a bit
[11:26:58] <muzone> Duckpaste: so it is possible?
[11:27:21] <Duckpaste> yea, just make some changes to the css
[11:27:42] <muzone> Duckpaste: can you help?
[11:31:26] <muzone> Duckpaste: you know what I gotta change?
[11:31:41] * muzone sneaks up to Duckpaste and puts the airhorn right next to his ear
[11:31:45] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[11:35:16] <Do``> i'm trying to detect if loading an iframe failed (internal server error or timeout), but the $.error function doesn't work on iframes
[11:35:20] <Do``> does anybody know a workaround?
[11:35:37] <muzone> Duckpaste: Duckpaste: Duckpaste:
[11:36:42] <Duckpaste> my css isnt great im afraid xD
[11:37:20] <muzone> ;-)
[11:37:24] <TrueColors> I have an element in a form, I have an onclick event with a field,and I want to grab it's parent form.
[11:37:31] <TrueColors> but.. .parent() won't work as it's in a divi nside a form
[11:39:28] <Duckpaste> TrueColors: will .closest('form') work?
[11:40:13] <TrueColors> .closest works with one of the parents, right?
[11:40:29] <TrueColors> with only the parents&*
[11:41:04] <Duckpaste> as in only direct parents? or as in not siblings?
[11:41:04] <a|i> does .eq(i) selector loop over doms to find the ith element, or is it of constant order?
[11:42:13] <TrueColors> as in not siblings.
[11:42:37] <Duckpaste> .closest gets ancestors rather than siblings yea
[11:42:45] <TrueColors> ah, okay.
[11:45:04] <TrueColors> yup that works.
[11:46:39] <Do``> a|i: it's dom order
[11:46:55] <a|i> Do``:  'dom order'?
[11:46:58] <Do``> yes
[11:47:04] <a|i> Do``: you mean of O(N)?
[11:47:26] <Do``> i dont know what O(N) is out side of algorithm theory
[11:48:17] <a|i> Do``: does .eq() speed depend on how many elements exist in the document, or is the speed a constant?
[11:48:40] <Do``> it's not constant
[11:48:51] <Do``> um actually, it is constant
[11:48:56] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/7v8xU/ - the comment basically explains my issue - what's the easiest solution, I don't think it's valid to do return false ( 2 );
[11:48:57] <TrueColors> or whatever.
[11:49:07] <a|i> Do``: what changed your mind?
[11:49:14] <Do``> i thought about the answer
[11:49:25] <Do``> $("dsfjsdfds") returns a standard javascript array
[11:49:35] <a|i> okay?
[11:49:43] <Do``> eq(n) does nothing but return you the nth element of the array
[11:50:02] <Do``> that is pretty much constant
[11:50:03] <imsky> what's up my knee grows :V
[11:50:07] <a|i> yep.
[11:50:08] <a|i> thanks.
[11:50:15] <Do``> $("dsfjsdfds") is not however.
[11:50:19] <a|i> I love constant timing.
[11:51:14] <a|i> Do``:  $("dsfjsdfds") is not constant, but I hope even ie is fast on that.
[11:51:21] <a|i> bloody IE>
[11:51:24] <Do``> no, it's not
[11:51:27] <TrueColors> *cough*
[11:51:29] <Do``> and it all depends on your query
[11:51:30] <a|i> it's not?
[11:51:33] <TrueColors> ie's useful with anything
[11:51:38] <TrueColors> never useful*
[11:51:45] <imsky> ie10 is pretty spiffy bro
[11:51:52] <a|i> ie is useful with having about 50% of the users.
[11:52:03] <TrueColors> well yeah, they have improved dramatically with IE9 and 10
[11:52:10] <TrueColors> still missing some css3 styling though
[11:52:23] <a|i> ie10 does not mean that ie7 and ie8 and ie9 do not exist.
[11:52:28] <jdevel> IE10 is out already?
[11:52:33] <imsky> no bro
[11:52:34] <TrueColors> no
[11:52:38] <imsky> got the platform preview though
[11:52:40] <TrueColors> ya
[11:52:42] <jdevel> oh
[11:52:47] <a|i> why IE such a pain in the ass? why the old versions do not die like firefox and chrome old versions die instantly?
[11:52:56] <TrueColors> apparently it's a strict browser
[11:52:58] <TrueColors> everything has to be correct.
[11:53:02] <TrueColors> whilst others provide "flexibility"
[11:53:03] <jdevel> I still have to support idiots with IE6
[11:53:04] <TrueColors> but... i won't know.
[11:53:15] <TrueColors> yeah, I decided to hell with IE 6 now.
[11:53:19] <imsky> ie10 loads as fast as chrome now
[11:53:26] <imsky> pretty ace
[11:53:41] <a|i> seriously, why is that the lastest version of chrome can be run on winxp, but ie9 cannot be installe don win xp? why?
[11:53:53] <imsky> because winxp is baby poop
[11:53:54] <jdevel> I use IE dev tools to test for IE7 and 8
[11:54:07] <jdevel> F12
[11:54:09] <a|i> imsky: but the latest chrome runs on that baby poop?
[11:54:14] <imsky> windows 8 is coming out like next year and you want to keep using something that came out 10 years ago?
[11:54:14] <a|i> maybe ie is the baby poop here.
[11:54:18] <imsky> no
[11:54:25] <imsky> microsoft is using it as a strategy to migrate people
[11:54:40] <jdevel> I've been off XP for a long time now
[11:54:44] <imsky> same
[11:54:45] <TrueColors> ya, they did the same with WLM. Eventually, they won't be able to use it without upgrading and they can't upgrade it without upgrading windows.
[11:54:51] <TrueColors> I prefer XP over Vista.
[11:54:54] <jdevel> everyone bashed vista, but I never had any issues
[11:55:01] <a|i> migrate = forcing people to pay for another version of the os they have already paid for?
[11:55:02] <imsky> it's just slow, that's all
[11:55:03] <jdevel> I've got win 7 also
[11:55:12] <imsky> a|i: yeah that's capitalism baby
[11:55:19] <imsky> you don't expect your car company to give you a new car every year?
[11:55:27] <TrueColors> I wish.
[11:55:27] <Duckpaste> TrueColors: http://jsfiddle.net/7v8xU/2/ is that what you want it to do?
[11:55:43] <a|i> what is wrong with those 50% of people using ie? it is not 1995, why don't they just install FF or chrome?
[11:55:48] <imsky> i think a|i will change his tune once he makes money from selling software
[11:55:51] <TrueColors> that would work Duckpaste.
[11:55:56] <imsky> for now it's just more m$ h8
[11:56:02] <jdevel> a lot of people don't know they exist
[11:56:08] <jdevel> they use what came with their OS
[11:56:13] <TrueColors> ^
[11:56:27] <TrueColors> I know someone who does know about firefox etc but sitll use IE
[11:56:35] <TrueColors> They have yet to give me a valid reason
[11:56:37] <imsky> makes sense
[11:56:39] <imsky> use what your users use
[11:56:45] <jdevel> since windows has such a huge market presence that is why IE is as popular as it is.
[11:57:01] <a|i> if 70% of developers ban their apps to run on ie, those users will understand there are other browsers around.
[11:57:15] <imsky> you'd ban ie users from your app?
[11:57:16] <imsky> lol
[11:57:18] <a|i> shit that means 50% user loss for your app.
[11:57:20] <jdevel> and when I hear people say, I don't test my stuff in IE, I think they are stupid..
[11:57:26] <imsky> 242 ms for ie10 on sunspider
[11:57:28] <imsky> jdevel: same
[11:58:04] <TrueColors> Most my stuff does look alright, in terms of html and css in IE 5, 7+ but the bits that look wrong, are not so simple to fix.
[11:58:14] <imsky> 315ms for chrome 15 on sunspider
[11:58:20] <imsky> oh shiiiiiit son :U
[11:58:28] <TrueColors> sunspider?
[11:58:39] <imsky> don't have time to run dromaeo
[11:58:46] <a|i> chrome on sunspider? chrome has its own js engine?
[11:58:50] <imsky> wat
[11:58:54] <TrueColors> I was more or less askin what is sunspider. :P
[11:58:56] <imsky> js benchmark
[11:59:08] <Ukto> hey guys, anyone had an issue putting a set of tabs inside of a tab? when I change main tabs, the default 'selected' tab is removed from any sub-tabs
[11:59:14] <imsky> yo dawg i herd
[11:59:19] <imsky> #jquery-ui is elsewhere
[11:59:25] <Ukto> ah, thanks
[12:00:02] <imsky> man ie10 might be the default platform for js stuff now
[12:00:05] <a|i> imsky: i dont care how fast ie10 is, its daddy and grandaddies will never die in the next 5 years.
[12:00:06] <imsky> shame they don't have webgl
[12:00:13] <imsky> a|i: yeah they will
[12:00:18] <imsky> ie6 is around 3% for north america
[12:00:25] <a|i> after 5 years?
[12:00:34] <imsky> after 5 years of what
[12:00:34] <jdevel> dromaeo, has meteors about to kill all those poor little dino's
[12:00:34] <a|i> you want me to support ie7 for the next 5 years.
[12:00:46] <imsky> i don't want you to do anything
[12:00:47] <a|i> it took ie over 5 years to die.
[12:00:47] <TrueColors> 5 years isn't that long, and IE's grown a lot.
[12:00:51] <imsky> yeah
[12:00:54] <a|i> ie6*
[12:00:58] <imsky> i mean ms really got serious only in the last 3 years
[12:01:06] <imsky> once they pick up steam, you'll forget about ie6
[12:01:06] <a|i> imsky: fuk ms.
[12:01:10] <imsky> no, don't fuck ms
[12:01:12] <imsky> that's retarded
[12:01:23] <imsky> logically retarded
[12:01:24] <jdevel> lol
[12:01:38] <a|i> i don't care, whatever a js app takes I have to multiply it by 1.5 to cover ie ass.
[12:01:47] <a|i> it works in _every_ browser but ie.
[12:01:48] <imsky> then you're a bad developer
[12:01:52] <imsky> js shouldn't break
[12:01:55] <imsky> css/html, yeah maybe
[12:01:58] <jdevel> agreed
[12:02:13] <jdevel> then you use CSS if statements to correct your display issues.
[12:02:22] <Mimoso98> Hi
[12:02:22] <a|i> imsky: I'm talking about performance, not breaking.
[12:02:26] <TrueColors> I've had a jquery issue, but that's only when I do things like... var foo = { "foo" : "bar", }
[12:02:28] <imsky> a|i: ok
[12:02:29] <TrueColors> the comma of death.
[12:02:34] <TrueColors> IE5 complains at that
[12:02:36] <imsky> well that's just common sense TrueColors
[12:02:37] <TrueColors> probably IE6
[12:02:41] <imsky> hi Mimoso98
[12:02:55] <a|i> TrueColors: I use closure-compiler, it gives me a warning about that comma.
[12:03:12] <Mimoso98> I have a text box where I want to allow just A-Z and 0-9 characters. Is there any simple way of doing this from jQuery when $('#myfield').change(..) takes place? thanks
[12:03:18] <TrueColors> It doesn't bother PHP, which is my main language - so I just carried it over and sometimes I still do it but I'm learning not to
[12:03:19] <imsky> ye ye
[12:03:25] <imsky> TrueColors: :(
[12:03:30] <imsky> write proper js lol
[12:03:35] <imsky> it's not hard
[12:03:37] <TrueColors> O wos
[12:03:39] <TrueColors> oops
[12:03:41] <TrueColors> I wish I could.
[12:03:45] <imsky> are you
[12:03:48] <imsky> forced to dangle commas
[12:03:53] <a|i> how do you people test ie on a mac?
[12:03:59] <imsky> VM or a service
[12:04:04] <a|i> that virtual ie thing is about 10GB.
[12:04:07] <imsky> i'm not on a mac, lol that shit is cancer
[12:04:18] <TrueColors> It's a nice language, but looking at the shiz google, facebook and other high javascript usage apps use - it's bogus to me.
[12:04:19] <imsky> but there are really easy ways
[12:04:26] <a|i> and you have to install 10GB virtual os for each ie version.
[12:04:27] <imsky> TrueColors: what?
[12:04:31] <imsky> a|i: lol wat
[12:04:40] <imsky> install that ubuntu in a vm, put ie in there
[12:04:45] <jdevel> a|i: no..
[12:04:50] <jdevel> in IE, hit F12
[12:04:52] <TrueColors> I only know simple bits... they do complex stuff.
[12:04:59] <jdevel> then change the display version
[12:05:02] <imsky> TrueColors: they do industry-grade stuff...
[12:05:10] <TrueColors> industry-grade ?
[12:05:13] <srj55> I'm looking for an iframe slider (left/right slide in/out).  Can't find one with google. anyone know if this exists?
[12:05:17] <a|i> imsky: ms gives this virtual ie testing envs, instead of having all ie version in one env, it gives one virtual image per ie version.
[12:05:17] <imsky> yeah like billions of requests stuff
[12:05:22] <TrueColors> ah yeah.
[12:05:30] <imsky> a|i: nobody cares, install IE in ubuntu and you're good
[12:05:38] <imsky> who would download 10GB just to test their site?
[12:05:44] <jdevel> lol
[12:05:45] <a|i> imsky: ubuntu? on wine?
[12:05:48] <imsky> yeah man
[12:05:49] <jdevel> I would!
[12:05:51] <imsky> this is a solved problem
[12:06:03] <a|i> wine doesn't support all ie versions.
[12:06:03] <Mimoso98> I can intercept .keydown and check e.charCode?but what happens if users are using a different keyboard (spanish, english, etc..) ? thanks
[12:06:08] <imsky> a|i: so use ietester
[12:06:16] <imsky> Mimoso98: absolutely mayynne
[12:06:17] <jdevel> a|i, did you read what I wrote?
[12:06:23] <TrueColors> ietester ... I'm not so keen on it really.
[12:06:24] <jdevel> test like that
[12:06:35] <TrueColors> I mean it actually identifies conditionals unlike platform preview.
[12:06:36] <imsky> TrueColors: it's not bug-free, but for layout it works
[12:06:48] <a|i> jdevel: sorry I missed it, which line?
[12:07:01] <jdevel> jdevel> in IE, hit F12
[12:07:03] <TrueColors> yeah, i've had many bugs with it.
[12:07:18] <jdevel> then change browser mode
[12:07:19] <imsky> a|i: http://static.howtoforge.com/images/ubuntu_ies4linux/3.png
[12:07:28] <imsky> ie6 on ubuntu, omg
[12:07:29] <jdevel> in IE9, you can go back to IE7
[12:07:30] <TrueColors> forbidden ?
[12:08:11] <a|i> imsky: ie4linux is based on wine, and wine doe snot support the latest version of ie. even if it support a version it's very broken.
[12:08:12] <jdevel> so you can test 3 versions of IE in IE9
[12:08:18] <jdevel> which covers a bit of the base
[12:08:26] <imsky> a|i: why do you need the latest ie if you're bitching about ie6/ie7?
[12:08:34] <imsky> it renders the same as firefox/chrome
[12:08:36] <imsky> so...who cares
[12:08:51] <a|i> imsky: you have to test the whole freaking ie family.
[12:08:58] <imsky> then get a PC
[12:09:07] <jdevel> in most recent versions of the 3 major browsers, I have seen more display differences in FF.
[12:09:43] <TrueColors> FF 5-6 weren';t much of a display change.
[12:09:48] <jdevel> however now chrome and firefox are updating weekly
[12:09:53] <imsky> ye ye
[12:09:59] <jdevel> I don't mean GUI
[12:10:06] <imsky> waiting for that azure
[12:10:07] <TrueColors> firefox doesn't update weekly?
[12:10:08] <jdevel> HTML rendering
[12:10:22] <a|i> get a pc and pay for the os just to test the most retarded piece of software of this, and the last, millennium.
[12:10:33] <jdevel> seems like it at least, just always updating those browsers
[12:10:47] <imsky> a|i: it's gotten better... if your job requires you to test for IE, then you need a dedicated machine
[12:11:01] <TrueColors> Firefox updates a full version every 6 weeks ... I think it's stupid how that works. But at about the 3 week point, they go up to .1
[12:11:03] <a|i> imsky: yes, unfortunately.
[12:11:09] <imsky> that's just how everything works
[12:11:15] <imsky> microsoft developers have many test machines they use
[12:11:18] <imsky> for their OWN code
[12:11:25] <imsky> so you're bitching about being a second-rate developer...
[12:11:30] <imsky> cut it out bro
[12:11:39] <a|i> I want to live to see the day ie is wiped out.
[12:11:43] <imsky> lol
[12:11:53] <jdevel> don't think so
[12:11:54] <imsky> didn't ars run a feature recently
[12:12:04] <imsky> fanboys perceive threats to their favorite brand as a threat to their self-image
[12:12:16] <imsky> so if i tell a|i that apple sucks and ms rules, he'll fly into a rage
[12:12:25] <TrueColors> I do that!
[12:12:25] <jdevel> yea watch it man
[12:12:36] <TrueColors> well, not as much as I use to.
[12:12:39] <TrueColors> I never accepted other peoples opinions.
[12:12:44] <imsky> lol grow up bros
[12:13:10] <a|i> imsky: forget about ms, just think of it as a piece of software which is bad for the user and bad for the developers. that's funny.
[12:13:10] <imsky> ie6 hate was over the moment microsoft put up a site telling people to stop using it
[12:13:20] <imsky> a|i: how's it bad?
[12:13:46] <a|i> imsky: how's ie bad for the users or for the developers? in either case, do I have to explain?
[12:14:05] <imsky> i guess if you think a program being used by millions is categorically bad, yeah
[12:14:26] <a|i> it's not being 'used' by people, it's being 'forced to use'.
[12:14:26] <jdevel> the only thing that rubs me the wrong way a little is when people say Mac's don't get viruses.. they just don't understand market presence.. it makes no sense to put time into malware, spyware, viruses, that take up about 15% of the market.. it just doesn't reach nearly as many people and businesses
[12:14:37] <imsky> a|i: nobody forces anyone to use it, except for corporate reasons
[12:14:47] <imsky> jdevel: yeah this month was horrible for osx lion security
[12:15:01] <imsky> maybe jobs quit cause he was like "fuck that, i'm not fixing those bugs"
[12:15:05] <a|i> imsky: are you in ms payroll or something?
[12:15:06] <jdevel> and that will become the trend as popularity grows
[12:15:17] <imsky> a|i: lol you're a paranoid fanboy, that's funny
[12:15:29] <jdevel> it isn't invulnerable.. just not a target so much
[12:15:47] <imsky> jdevel: wait until apple gets 25% of the consumer market
[12:15:47] * a|i goes back to work.
[12:16:01] <imsky> viruses everywhere!
[12:16:07] <jdevel> indeed
[12:16:09] <TrueColors> apples never getting my vote.
[12:16:12] <jdevel> remote exploits etc.
[12:16:41] <imsky> i think i should tell a|i that apple is using microsoft for iCloud
[12:16:48] <imsky> MAKE SURE YOU NEVER UPGRADE TO LION FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
[12:16:54] <jdevel> the swiss have almost 18% mac market
[12:17:09] <imsky> trendy bastards
[12:18:15] <TrueColors> swiss = swedish?
[12:18:21] <imsky> no
[12:18:37] <jdevel> which is the highest around.. so with that said. is it any wonder that IE has such a heavy footing
[12:18:48] <imsky> ie6 has like 32% in china
[12:18:58] <imsky> a macbook user's worst nightmare
[12:19:06] <jdevel> china also has linux as the default OS in machines from my understanding
[12:19:11] <imsky> lol
[12:19:15] <imsky> ie6 on linux
[12:19:18] <imsky> BY DEFAULT
[12:19:36] <Duckpaste> http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-CN-monthly-201008-201108
[12:20:01] <imsky> wooo
[12:20:12] <TrueColors> gotta give them respect though, atleast they use linux :P
[12:20:21] <imsky> lol wat
[12:20:25] <imsky> don't believe the propaganda
[12:20:30] <jdevel> I'm constantly telling clients etc. to update their browsers as it's a security risk to keep the old browsers installed.
[12:20:48] <imsky> ie6 is at 1.1% in USA
[12:20:50] <imsky> holy crap
[12:20:55] <jdevel> excellent
[12:20:56] <imsky> good job america
[12:21:03] <imsky> we kicked our past's ass
[12:21:07] <jdevel> that 1.1% is Texas
[12:21:08] <jdevel> lol
[12:21:11] <imsky> 0_o
[12:21:26] <imsky> ie9 is 11%
[12:21:28] <imsky> daaamn
[12:21:38] <jdevel> stuck on 7 and 8 huh
[12:21:48] <imsky> 8 more than 7, way more
[12:21:49] <imsky> that's good
[12:22:21] <jdevel> indeed
[12:22:24] <jdevel> that graph is a mess
[12:22:43] <imsky> ie7 had 53% in dec 2008
[12:23:02] <TrueColors> 2.45% in the uk.
[12:23:03] <imsky> that was just 3 years ago
[12:23:06] <TrueColors> for ie6.
[12:23:10] <imsky> sweet
[12:23:22] <imsky> canada is probably at 0
[12:24:06] <jdevel> IE does bother me in the fact that they don't want to listen to w3 standards.. and go their own route
[12:24:12] <TrueColors> 2.18% in canada lol
[12:24:41] <imsky> well i can tell you that i rarely get ie6 users anymore
[12:24:53] <imsky> so at least in the web industries, for our own purposes, ie6 is long dead
[12:24:55] <jdevel> some of their off path approaches to have nice additions, but are only good in their browsers
[12:25:08] <jdevel> yea, except in TX..
[12:25:11] <imsky> hey don't forget
[12:25:16] <imsky> everyone else takes after MS
[12:25:27] <imsky> xhr was some off-the-path crap for ie
[12:25:35] <jdevel> yep
[12:25:36] <imsky> boom, instant web revolution
[12:25:41] <jdevel> you got that right
[12:26:00] <jdevel> that is part of the beauty of forging your own path in some instances
[12:26:10] <imsky> it's pretty cool that win8 will have that active desktop by default
[12:26:17] <imsky> our skills will transfer instantly
[12:26:39] <jdevel> you mean web backgrounds?
[12:26:56] <imsky> not just that
[12:27:04] <jdevel> over the years I've fixed many computer viruses that hi-jacked active desktop
[12:27:17] <imsky> yeah but clearly ms is doing something different here
[12:27:31] <jdevel> i haven't read much about win8
[12:27:42] <imsky> it's better than win7, but mostly for us devs
[12:27:55] <imsky> "The other type of application, which has to be written in HTML5 and Javascript, looks more like a mobile application, filling the full screen. Internet Explorer 10, which is part of Windows 8, has already been configured to run in this mode, as have several widget-like apps for checking stock prices and weather."
[12:27:57] <TrueColors> active desktops were discontinued in vista?
[12:28:08] <imsky> not discontinued, put into sidebar, and then gadgets for win7
[12:28:12] <imsky> they keep modifying this feature
[12:28:16] <Duckpaste> isnt that just the same as the .hta's and win7 gadgets we already have though?
[12:28:20] <imsky> yep
[12:28:25] <imsky> except better, more secure, etc
[12:28:28] <TrueColors> oh right ya
[12:28:30] <TrueColors> I hate the sidebar
[12:28:30] <imsky> active desktop/gadgets never caught on
[12:28:33] <imsky> ^
[12:28:35] <imsky> exactly lol
[12:28:41] <imsky> it's pretty painful to develop for
[12:29:02] <imsky> you're going to see a big change with win8
[12:29:09] <imsky> apple this time will lag on the desktop
[12:30:23] <TrueColors> I want windows to be able to switch views, you know like Linux can. I found it very cool.
[12:30:31] <imsky> you mean switch desktops?
[12:30:36] <TrueColors> Not sure if it's osmething I'd use often, but I'd certainly give it a try.
[12:30:37] <TrueColors> Yeah.
[12:30:44] <imsky> that'd be interesting
[12:31:31] <TrueColors> My resolution is too small for the amount of windows I like to have open, so that feature would be nice.
[12:31:32] <imsky> that's one reason i like to stretch out my linux sessions ;) compiz expo baby
[12:32:56] <TrueColors> I have ubuntu on my desktop (faulty ram atm) I need to find a wireless dongle that linux supports.
[12:33:04] <TrueColors> Was unable to find any drivers for the one i currently have.
[12:33:23] <imsky> i never had problems with wireless on ubuntu
[12:33:29] <imsky> it's been pretty solid about that
[12:33:39] <imsky> can't you use ethernet?
[12:34:09] <TrueColors> Oh yeah, I thought about that - using ethernet and let linux find my drivers.
[12:34:15] <imsky> lol?
[12:34:19] <imsky> why aren't you doing that
[12:34:25] <TrueColors> I need to bring the desktop down.
[12:34:30] <TrueColors> I probably will when my new ram arrives.
[12:34:48] <TrueColors> It's in my room which is... the attic room.
[12:34:59] <TrueColors> I don't have a socket up there. ^.^
[12:35:24] <imsky> wat
[12:36:09] <TrueColors> I havent' got a cable long enough to travel up two flights of stairs... and when I get my new ram, I'll be bringing the desktop down and fitting it downstairs.
[12:36:30] <imsky> you fail at technology
[12:36:36] <imsky> bring your damn desktop downstairs
[12:37:06] <TrueColors> There isn't much room so that's why I only do it temporary
[12:37:24] <TrueColors> will be when we move house though... which may be some time -.-
[12:37:33] <imsky> lol guy with attic says there's not enough room
[12:37:38] <imsky> take a pic of your room
[12:37:42] <imsky> let's see how much room you have
[12:37:46] <TrueColors> my room is fine, but downstairs there isn't much room
[12:39:03] <TrueColors> http://vvcap.net/db/NfsszIF6O_yvXqL5IN1v.htp (image) the one with the white door. my little house.
[12:39:05] <TrueColors> it's rented -.-
[12:39:09] <TrueColors> so can't exactly do much with it
[12:39:24] <imsky> oh ok
[12:39:30] <imsky> yeah i can see how it might be a little constricting
[12:39:35] <imsky> what are you using now?
[12:39:48] <Woet> [21:29:08] <imsky> apple this time will lag on the desktop
[12:39:51] <Woet> dont think so
[12:40:01] <TrueColors> I use wireless, I don't use my desktop as ... well the connection with my dongle up there is rather weak but my laptop is fine.
[12:40:02] <imsky> apple hasn't really pursued web stack on desktop like MS has
[12:40:08] <imsky> they do other stuff
[12:40:09] <Woet> although vista -> win7 was a good improvement
[12:40:19] <imsky> woet, ms has had internet explorer inside the os since win 98
[12:40:27] <imsky> it's their long term strategy, always has been
[12:40:34] <Woet> hasn't always been :P
[12:40:36] <TrueColors> but the attic is a nice size, it's just the damn roof - it ... takes away space pretty much.
[12:40:38] <Woet> only because of netscape
[12:40:39] <imsky> yeah dude, always
[12:40:50] <imsky> 17 years is "always"
[12:41:07] <Woet> its a long time
[12:41:09] <Woet> but not always :)
[12:41:13] <imsky> 13, not 17
[12:41:18] <StPiere> anyone uses lowpro for jquery ?
[12:41:23] <imsky> what was their pre-98 strategy, woet?
[12:41:27] <imsky> office and windows, right?
[12:41:35] <imsky> office is tied to IE just as much as windows is
[12:41:45] <Woet> i have no idea, but they haven't _always_ been into the web
[12:41:45] <TrueColors> I've never had office installed :(
[12:41:47] <TrueColors> I've had a trial
[12:41:53] <Woet> only once netscape proved it was amazing
[12:41:55] <imsky> woet, that's because the web hasn't always been around
[12:41:58] <Woet> did they invest in the web
[12:42:09] <imsky> so your point of contention
[12:42:15] <imsky> is that they didn't consider the web in 1993
[12:42:19] <imsky> ok gotcha buddy, move along now
[12:42:36] <Woet> you said 'always has been', just pointing out that isn't the case :)
[12:42:46] <imsky> yeah technically precise and argumentative nerd, gotcha
[12:42:48] <Woet> they've always been behind on the facts
[12:42:53] <Woet> in regards to the web
[12:43:02] <imsky> they stopped dev after ie6 for various reasons
[12:43:07] <imsky> not really behind
[12:43:12] <imsky> browser wars was a big thing
[12:43:50] <imsky> i mean shit, did you really expect them to care after netscape folded?
[12:44:19] <Woet> they sure invested a lot in IE9 marketing to try and get back some market share in browsers
[12:44:26] <imsky> yeah duh
[12:44:29] <Woet> because ie6 - ie8 was horrible
[12:44:30] <imsky> for-profit corporation
[12:44:32] <Woet> hence, behind the facts
[12:44:43] <imsky> lol ok
[12:44:49] <imsky> in the case of win8
[12:44:50] <TrueColors> I personally don't think 7 and 8 were that bad.
[12:44:57] <imsky> everyone else will be behind the facts
[12:45:05] <imsky> unless apple drops "snow tiger" or whatever
[12:45:15] <imsky> with eerily similar iDesktop features
[12:45:16] <Woet> if windows 8 is just as big of an improvement as vista -> 7, i can imagine that
[12:45:33] <imsky> win7 is just vista sp1
[12:45:42] <imsky> with minor ux improvements
[12:45:56] <Woet> i'm not talking about the user interface
[12:46:04] <imsky> what are you talking about then
[12:46:20] <Woet> everything about the OS.
[12:46:44] <imsky> oh ok, so what hardware-level improvements did you like best about 7?
[12:47:29] <Woet> i said, 'everything about the OS'
[12:47:38] <imsky> so the os doesn't talk to hardware
[12:47:41] <imsky> that's not part of everything
[12:47:48] <Woet> are you reading what i'm saying or what?
[12:47:57] <Woet> how does 'everything about the OS' mean 'THE OS DOESNT TALK TO HARDWARE'
[12:48:12] <imsky> so do you not have any hardware-level improvements that you liked about 7?
[12:48:29] <Woet> i haven't used windows 7 as much, since I bought a macbook during vista times :)
[12:48:36] <imsky> oh ok
[12:48:37] <Woet> when apps were no longer supporting XP and vista was horrible
[12:48:50] <imsky> so you're unqualified to talk
[12:48:54] <imsky> gotcha
[12:49:09] <Woet> anyone in this channel is qualified to talk :)
[12:49:14] <imsky> not when it's out of their ass
[12:49:23] <Woet> maybe not qualified to copy your opinion
[12:49:23] <imsky> thanks for the argument bro, moving on now
[12:49:26] <Woet> but surely qualified to talk
[12:49:45] <TrueColors> technically this should only be about jquery, not ms, apple etc.
[12:49:55] <imsky> jquery is freenode personified
[12:49:58] <imsky> we are the real #freenode
[12:51:43] <randomor> hey,  why can't I join() that array in the function here: http://jsfiddle.net/mXzLN/
[12:51:49] <randomor> thanks for help!
[12:51:57] <imsky> hmm just thought about it, another benefit of win8, more touchscreens on laptops
[12:52:28] <TrueColors> I don't know what I think about touch screens yet.
[12:52:44] <TrueColors> I've used a smart phone but... it just didn't seem to be my thing.
[12:52:45] <shesek> When would val() return a number? (http://api.jquery.com/val/ - .val() Returns: String, Number, Array)
[12:53:29] <angvent> Hi .. can anyone tell me why this doesnt work?  http://pastebin.com/g5pEskFq   the bind doesnt seem to take effect..
[12:53:31] <imsky> randomor: that looks wrong, sorry buddy
[12:53:46] <TrueColors> a number would be a number, I don't think it's talking integers.
[12:53:52] <ajpiano> randomor, $(foo).map() returns a jQuery object... do .map(fn).get() and then you can call join on oit
[12:53:53] <ajpiano> on it
[12:54:16] <randomor> i see. thanks. i
[12:54:22] <imsky> he'll be back
[12:55:01] <Woet> have you ran windows 8 yet, imsky
[12:55:02] <Woet> ?
[12:55:05] <imsky> lol wat
[12:55:13] <imsky> do you know what windows 8 is?
[12:55:16] <Woet> sure
[12:55:18] <Woet> have you ran it yet? :)
[12:55:37] <TrueColors> It's apparently in public beta at the end of this "fall" ... not quite sure what a fall is in uk terms.
[12:55:41] <imsky> hm let's see how this conversation will go: "no i haven't" "then how are you qualified to talk about it?" " :U "
[12:55:58] <Woet> awesome!
[12:56:14] <imsky> what's awesome?
[12:56:24] <Woet> so i'm not qualified to talk about windows 7 cause i don't use it on a daily basis, but you are qualified to talk about windows 8 based upon a few youtube movies
[12:56:26] <Woet> 'gotcha' :)
[12:56:39] <imsky> lol wat
[12:56:44] <imsky> are you a designer by any chance
[12:56:55] <Woet> no, i'm not
[12:57:06] <imsky> oh ok, at least then you'd have a redeeming quality for your lack of logic
[12:57:08] <kinesis> can anyone shine a hint as to why this wont work in Firefox, but works in chrome? http://ocpro.com/uploader/
[12:57:25] <imsky> "a few youtube movies" jesus christ
[12:57:39] <angvent> Anyone? my problem is better than windows 8
[12:57:46] <TrueColors> what version of firefox?
[12:57:48] <imsky> no way bro
[12:57:53] <imsky> angvent: what's your problem
[12:57:58] <angvent> Hi .. can anyone tell me why this doesnt work?  http://pastebin.com/g5pEskFq   the bind doesnt seem to take effect..
[12:57:59] <kinesis> 6.01
[12:58:14] <imsky> angvent: take it up with the guy who wrote the plugin
[12:58:15] <kinesis> i think i ahve an idea what it is
[12:58:28] <angvent> regardless of the plugin.. why does the bind doesnt take effect  ?
[12:58:36] <imsky> my answer to that is :V
[12:59:00] <randomor> ajpiano: how do i use that .get() anyway? any pointers? sorry, noob here.
[12:59:03] <TrueColors> I receive this... kinesis: Error: A problem occurred during file upload!
[12:59:11] <imsky> lol woet, why did you follow the exact template of the conversation i laid out
[12:59:13] <ajpiano> randomor: $(".foo").map(fn).get().join("");
[12:59:15] <kinesis> TrueColors: does it appear in the iframe or does it redirect you?
[12:59:18] <imsky> i just realized that you did that
[12:59:33] <TrueColors> it opens a new tab with uploader.php in
[12:59:34] <kinesis> its not supposed to redirect, try it in chrome
[12:59:35] <kinesis> yeah
[12:59:38] <kinesis> its not supposed to do that
[12:59:40] <kinesis> in chrome it works right
[12:59:44] <Woet> angvent: what are you basing cbox_closed upon?
[12:59:51] <Woet> angvent: i don't see that event being fired in the colorbox source
[13:00:38] <MatBoy> Woet: man... script hangs on images that it could not find... updater scripts did not work because of that
[13:00:47] <imsky> bahaha
[13:01:03] <Woet> MatBoy: what?
[13:01:30] <MatBoy> Woet: the script I showed you... it wouldn' t close because it could not find the image of that close button
[13:01:44] <Woet> MatBoy: no, it wouldn't close because effects.js was a 404.
[13:02:05] <Woet> :)
[13:02:19] <StPiere> does anyone has any idea why this doesnt work:  http://pastebin.com/D5ve2hGj
[13:02:58] <ajpiano> angvent: from briefly looking at the docs it looks like you do binding for the colorbox like any other custom event in jquery.. $(document).bind("cbox_close") etc
[13:03:02] <ajpiano> not $.fn.colorbox.bind
[13:03:20] <angvent> hmhmh let me try
[13:03:34] <Woet> angvent: it's mentioned at http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/ at 'Extending'
[13:03:37] <MatBoy> Woet: but what do you prefer... not that we are in a jquery channel... prototype or jquery ? They are kinda the same but prototype uses a shorter syntax sometimes but can have issues with JS in callbacks
[13:03:57] <Woet> MatBoy: i'm in the jQuery channel, make a guess
[13:04:16] <MatBoy> Woet: yes I understand... but do you see an advantage somewhere ?
[13:04:33] <randomor> ajpiano: got it, thanks so much!
[13:05:28] <Woet> MatBoy: i've used mootools before, but it had various bugs that they weren't addressing and lacked popular plugins
[13:05:39] <TrueColors> Been ages since I used mootools
[13:05:47] <Woet> MatBoy: jquery didn't have those bugs and definitely doesn't lack any plugins
[13:05:50] <MatBoy> Woet: ok but prototype is not mootools ...
[13:05:51] <Woet> MatBoy: never used prototype.
[13:06:00] <MatBoy> yeah indeed
[13:06:07] <MatBoy> I see that also googleling
[13:06:17] <ajpiano> oh cool a jquery vs prototype discussion after a windows 7 vs windows 8 discussion
[13:06:20] <MatBoy> Woet: with jquery you only need one libary I think
[13:06:30] <Woet> MatBoy: it's a matter of personal like, usually
[13:06:35] <ajpiano> clearly it's another sunday funday in here
[13:06:36] <MatBoy> ajpiano: no just informative... I want to switch if better :)
[13:06:58] <MatBoy> Woet: okay! I don' t like bugs that I alreayd have seen now ;) FB is nice for that!
[13:07:08] <ajpiano> prototype's API is kinda morose, imo
[13:07:18] <imsky> ajpiano: i don't think there was a 7 vs 8 discussion
[13:07:23] <imsky> don't just skim the channel bro
[13:07:28] <MatBoy> Woet: it does not use W3C that much as far as I can see
[13:07:41] <MatBoy> ajpiano: morose ?

[13:09:34] <bot-t> imsky, Dragon Tank Truck | English Russia - http://englishrussia.com/2007/06/05/dragon-tank-truck/
[13:09:39] <imsky> everyone click
[13:09:47] <TrueColors> I love that truck
[13:09:57] <imsky> lol how can you not
[13:10:05] <imsky> it's batmobile's older dumber brother
[13:10:06] <angvent> that works.. i was binding  at the wrong time
[13:15:02] <MatBoy> will head home... see you guys in bed :P
[13:16:14] <infusi0n> hey guys
[13:17:23] <imsky> what's going on playa
[13:17:26] <infusi0n> I wrote the followong already on the dev chan but I'm now here on #jquery because for that kind of query you guys can perhabs help a bit more. I've just published v1.8 of my xcolor plugin ( http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-color-plugin-xcolor/ ) and v1.0 of my paging plugin ( http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised/ ). While I developed on these plugins I got the following 3 questions:
[13:18:15] <infusi0n> 1. What do you think about changing the animate() function to support arrays for the embedded values. For my xcolor lib, i made it possible to animate over a list of colors, implemented as CSV atm. Having this as array would open some more syntacticly gimmickry. However, arrays are used for specialEasing atm. Would such a change make sense or is a stable API important to you (BC)?
[13:18:50] <imsky> ok bro you are in the wrong channel
[13:19:01] <infusi0n> once again? ;D
[13:19:08] <imsky> yes
[13:19:25] <imsky> #jquery-dev
[13:19:28] <imsky> that's your ticket
[13:19:33] <infusi0n> #jquery-dev sent me to #jquery
[13:19:36] <infusi0n> hm
[13:19:42] <imsky> they were trolling you
[13:31:57] <MatBoy> he bed !
[13:31:58] <MatBoy> nice
[13:41:07] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/Xd2qN/1/ I have something like this, it's not working on there... chrome says "populate" is not defined, but it's a damn defined function. but anyway
[13:41:10] <TrueColors> is there a better way to write it?
[13:44:55] <Liveman> Hey guys I'm using a custom JSON function that uses serializeArray() and turns it into ajax, then I pass it through $.ajax to a GET function (data) .. on the php side I get [object Object] but I can't json_decode to get array again.. ideas?
[13:45:06] <TrueColors> turns it into ajax?
[13:45:27] <Liveman> bad choice of words, I then submit it through ajax
[13:45:37] <TrueColors> I used serializeArray before.
[13:45:39] <Liveman> I meant turns it into a JSON var
[13:45:43] <TrueColors> use it normally.
[13:45:46] <TrueColors> $_GET [ 'field' ]
[13:45:54] <TrueColors> print_r ( $_GET ); to see what's there
[13:46:30] <TrueColors> serializeArray pretty much does { "field" : "value", ... ... }
[13:49:58] <Liveman> swet ty trucolors got it to work
[13:52:36] <widoz> yeah i love jquery
[13:52:38] <widoz> XD
[13:53:19] <TrueColors> but anyway, is there a better way to write http://jsfiddle.net/Xd2qN/1/
[13:54:47] <tomastenerife352> hi im having a jquery problem, im trying to solve a newsroller conflict on my joomla web portal, it makes the mootools based top meny disappear in IE as well as a message at the bottom saying "1 item remaining" like forever
[13:55:46] <tomastenerife352> days of googling and research has shown that it most likely is IE not handling use of transparent png images in animations
[14:02:46] <tomasm-> whats the easiest way to post data to a page and parse the response as if it were assumed to be json?
[14:13:54] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/Xd2qN/3/ this is the working version
[14:14:02] <TrueColors> but all them selectors etc just look ugly
[14:20:04] <JesperA> TrueColors day doesnt work so good
[14:20:19] <TrueColors> what do you mean?
[14:20:46] <TrueColors> pick february and it cchanges to 28 or 29 depending on the year
[14:20:59] <JesperA> if i select day first, then select month, day will revert back to Day: again
[14:21:08] <TrueColors> yeah
[14:21:28] <TrueColors> I prevented that once, and also put Y, M, D
[14:21:38] <TrueColors> but I saw other sites not bother with it
[14:21:49] <JesperA> ok
[14:22:27] <TrueColors> I'd have it in, but i mainly took it out for that reason, as an attempt to make it... well better.
[14:22:32] <TrueColors> it can't be healthy with those selectors
[14:31:18] <TrueColors> http://vvcap.net/db/qjJn6PHMCfuR5dQb2iVS.htp I feel sorry for those peoples birthdays that are on the 31st october (image)
[14:33:53] <Divanti> Anyone tried using a MacBook Air (2011) as their main machine?
[14:34:17] <TrueColors> ew
[14:34:50] <TrueColors> can't beleive you had the cheek to mention an apple product ;)
[14:37:31] <ldexterldesign> sup guys, how might i go about checking whether an element is hovered over?
[14:37:34] <SinnerNyx> two questions: in JQ-UI what's the external folder for? Secondly is there some cross-browser method in JQuery that will allow me to warn the user before leaving a page? (An upload is in progress, if you leave the page now the upload will not finish. Are you sure you wish to leave now?)
[14:37:57] <ldexterldesign> is mouseover() the way to go?
[14:43:37] <Liveman> hey guys, I submited a form using serializeArray in ajax.. what command do I need to run on the PHP side to get it back to normal?
[14:43:42] <TrueColors> well that .each was replaced with $('select[name=regDay]').find('option[value!=""]').remove();
[14:44:31] <TrueColors> I thoguht we went through this liveman
[14:44:56] <Liveman> I ran that correctly and it passes it through correctly now but I cant get the arrya from the seralize
[14:45:02] <Liveman> that jquery made
[14:45:41] <TrueColors> like I said.. print_r ( $_GET );
[14:45:45] <TrueColors> to see what's in the $_GET
[14:46:06] <SinnerNyx> Is there some cross-browser method in JQuery that will allow me to warn the user before leaving a page? (An upload is in progress, if you leave the page now the upload will not finish. Are you sure you wish to leave now?)
[14:47:12] <Liveman> that brings up a string() then a bunch of [object Object], [object Object] etc
[14:47:27] <TrueColors> can you pastebin what outputs?
[14:53:40] <TrueColors> Hey ravenzz you might be able to help: http://jsfiddle.net/Xd2qN/4/ I think this is horrible - is there a better way of doing it?
[14:53:44] <TrueColors> it's just mostly all the selectors.
[14:53:47] <TrueColors> and things
[14:56:44] <ravenzz> TrueColors you can group the options within the optgroup html element
[14:56:59] <TrueColors> I don't understand>
[14:57:25] <TrueColors> oh I see
[14:57:31] <TrueColors> No I can't do that because it's for dobs
[14:58:21] <TrueColors> they have to be separate drop downs unless I have a billion options for each day of the month of the year for each dob..
[14:58:25] <TrueColors> unless I don't understand correctly
[14:58:39] <TrueColors> but i was more or less talking about the js
[14:59:12] <ravenzz> yep just to avoid this <option value="" selected disabled>Day:</option>
[14:59:49] <TrueColors> why would I want to avoid that?
[14:59:56] <TrueColors> using optgroup doesn't have a default value
[15:00:07] <TrueColors> like... that ... option there
[15:01:08] <TrueColors> but yeah the html is fine.it's just the js. let me go upstairs. brb.
[15:01:17] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/kC5tb/
[15:01:19] <TrueColors> wow, i was marked as away.
[15:01:20] <ravenzz> ok
[15:01:36] <ravenzz> let me see
[15:03:43] <ravenzz> doesn't it works?
[15:07:00] <TrueColors> ok im back
[15:09:00] <TrueColors> but yeah, that optgroup just isn't... what I like.because I'd rather have "Day:" as default, and whatever.
[15:10:01] <brian_petersen> how do i use an input field to automatically filter an ul of li to automatically? is this possible to jquery?
[15:10:51] <TrueColors> I don't understand what you mean brian?
[15:12:09] <brian_petersen> ok, so I have a lot of li, i want to be able to type into an input field and have jquery automatically filter through them and only show what the user has started to type into the input field.
[15:12:56] <brian_petersen> i just found what I needed, i've been searching for hours!!
[15:18:43] <ravenzz> TrueColors http://jsfiddle.net/kC5tb/1/
[15:19:44] <ravenzz> oh there is an useless row: var foo = new Date('2011', '2', 0).getDate();
[15:19:54] <TrueColors> yeah was about to question that
[15:20:40] <ravenzz> btw you should init that in the right way. becouse of january is selected by default
[15:21:21] <ravenzz> also, i am not sure, but i think that there is a better way to add a label to be shown by default
[15:21:29] <ravenzz> just ask on #html
[15:21:32] <ravenzz> or google for it
[15:22:55] <TrueColors> what do you mean by "init that in the right way" ?
[15:23:52] <ravenzz> actually january is selected by default. so on document ready you should execute the same stuffs we execute on change()
[15:25:01] <TrueColors> im confused why? also, why is there a :selected if you don't need to use it?
[15:25:38] <ravenzz> where the :selected is?
[15:26:06] <TrueColors> you don't have one, but what I mean is :selected can be used to get the selected option but why does that exist if you don'#t need to use it?
[15:27:33] <ravenzz> because when you select something you are setting its value to its own select
[15:27:42] <ravenzz> so $('select').val()
[15:27:53] <ravenzz> will return the last selected option
[15:28:51] <TrueColors> alright
[15:29:27] <TrueColors> ds = new Date($('#yob').val(), $('#mob').val(), 0).getDate(); -- how does this reeturn the amount of days
[15:29:28] <TrueColors> ?
[15:30:43] <ravenzz> let's say that you select february from this select: <select name="regMonth" id="mob">
[15:31:10] <ravenzz> so..the change event will be catched
[15:31:49] <ravenzz> because of the $('#mob, #yob').change(...)
[15:32:06] <TrueColors> well I was more or less on about the date function.
[15:32:36] <TrueColors> with it being a "Date" function, I would of expected it to return a date.
[15:32:36] <ravenzz> ok now you can retreive the value of that select with $('#mob').val()
[15:33:44] <ravenzz> sorry i suck in english...so it's hard to me to explain what's going on there :s
[15:33:57] <TrueColors> Ah, what's your first language
[15:33:58] <TrueColors> ?
[15:34:02] <ravenzz> anyway getDate() method returns the day of the month (from 1 to 31) for the specified date, according to local time.
[15:34:37] <ravenzz> Italian, and italians sucks in english you know :p
[15:35:21] <TrueColors> I can never get my head around other languages.
[15:35:32] <TrueColors> They don't work the same as English... and I think of English as being.. logical.
[15:35:37] <TrueColors> Though that's only because it's my language...
[15:35:56] <ravenzz> yes maybe. anyway you don't need to learn other languages :p
[15:36:14] <ravenzz> i mean, i don't care about french, spanish, german or whatever
[15:36:20] <ravenzz> english is good enough
[15:36:45] <TrueColors> Yeah, you've got to know a bit of English with it's huge... use in the world.
[15:39:26] <ravenzz> indeed i am looking for a job outside italy and in the meantime for good english courses
[15:39:56] <TrueColors> yeah, I quite like German, it's a shame I can speak it kind of, but not understand it.
[15:40:20] <TrueColors>  while (d <= ds) { d++; } < why did you choose this, instead of for ( d = 1; d <= ds; d++ ) { ... }
[15:40:45] <ravenzz> the same
[15:41:07] <ravenzz> i was a little bit nostalgic of while
[15:42:11] <TrueColors> I feel ashamed, I just had to google what Nostalgic meant.[
[15:42:55] <TrueColors> I quite like my fors, I don't generally use whiles like that in php... and most my habits in JavaScript came from php
[15:43:16] <SinnerNyx> Is there some cross-browser method in JQuery that will allow me to warn the user before leaving a page? (An upload is in progress, if you leave the page now the upload will not finish. Are you sure you wish to leave now?)
[15:43:43] <ajpiano> SinnerNyx: use the onbeforeunload event
[15:43:49] <ajpiano> ?g jquery onbeforeunload
[15:44:35] <SinnerNyx> ajpiano: k, thx I'll try that out
[15:44:49] <snover> ?g bot-t broken
[15:47:07] <TrueColors> bot-t was my best friend :( i don't want him to be broken. lol
[15:50:26] <SvcGhost> Hey guys, so this is wierd: I view a page using my regulr browser and page appears fine. When I view it with my proxy server the login div fades in upon page load. How can I debug this?
[15:51:14] <TrueColors> if there is no fade going on in the jquery, then it can't be that?
[15:51:14] <TrueColors> :P
[15:52:15] <SvcGhost> Any ideas yall
[15:52:29] <Viper007Bond> is there a way to watch for $('#foo').customMethod() being run and then my own function after it's completed? customMethod() is not mine.
[15:53:00] <Viper007Bond> *and then run
[15:53:03] <TrueColors> Viper...
[15:53:13] <TrueColors> var foo = $('#foo').customMethod();
[15:53:14] <TrueColors> uhm.
[15:53:18] <TrueColors> sec.
[15:53:47] <Viper007Bond> i'm not calling the method, some other js is. i just want to modify it's results each time it runs.
[15:53:48] <TrueColors> oh
[15:53:57] <danzik17> Viper007Bond: see ?deferred
[15:53:57] <bot-t> Viper007Bond, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[15:54:03] <TrueColors> I was gonna suggest ... foo.complete(function() { ... });
[15:54:16] <TrueColors> but... it appears that doesn't quite work with any method
[15:54:51] <Divanti> Sorry for off-top but have a question: Anyone tried using a MacBook Air (2011) as their main machine?
[15:55:30] <J2EE> good nigths ;(
[15:56:40] <nebbie> Divanti: why not?
[15:57:32] <Divanti> On the fence about buying the new 1.8 core i7 13 air
[15:58:15] <SvcGhost> Hey guys, so this is wierd: I view a page using my regulr browser and page appears fine. When I view it with my proxy server the login div fades in upon page load. How can I debug this?
[15:58:20] <Viper007Bond> danheberden: interesting, but since i'm not calling the code, i can't chain.  basically some other code does $('#foo').click(function(){ some ajax and then a dom modifiction });    i want to run my own code after that's done. does't seem like that's really possible without modifying the other file, so i'll just go for an alternate solution such as watching for dom modifications.
[15:58:49] <nebbie> air is powerful enough for web development.. best for portability obviously or else u should spend that money on a mbp
[16:05:04] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/Xd2qN/6/ this is my updated dob selector. it remembers the day now.

[16:36:07] <taktoa1> Hi
[16:36:20] <taktoa1> I'm working on a project with jquery and cakephp
[16:36:28] <taktoa1> and I've made a search form
[16:36:32] <coldhead> ?csb
[16:36:33] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[16:36:49] <taktoa1> the php side works, but I can't seem to get JQuery to do proper event handling
[16:37:19] <taktoa1> here's the site: http://opennotes1.dyndns.org:1234
[16:38:09] <iszak> coldhead, wonder how many times they had to do that for it to work.
[16:38:50] <taktoa1> the requisite javascript file is browse.js
[16:38:58] <taktoa1> does anyone know why it's not working?
[16:40:10] <ajpiano> taktoa1: it all has to be in the document ready block
[16:40:15] <taktoa1> ah, I see
[16:40:21] <taktoa1> thanks
[16:40:32] <ajpiano> the first thing is nested inside of TWO doc ready blocks
[16:40:38] <ajpiano> and the second one is in 0
[16:40:46] <ajpiano> you should have one block with both things in it :)
[16:40:58] <ajpiano> $(function() { } is the same as $(document).ready(function() { });
[16:41:08] <taktoa1> ok
[16:41:51] <taktoa1> thanks a bunch
[17:02:42] <angvent> if i have   someElement = $(".someElement")  how do I "get" one of its children?  such as.. someElement.(".otherSelectorWithin")  ??
[17:03:47] <angvent> nevermind
[17:04:52] <atrigent> can the append function take an array containing anything that append would accept by itself?
[17:05:13] <atrigent> for example, could I pass append an array containing a mix of dom elements and strings?
[17:11:08] <shesek> When would val() return a number? (http://api.jquery.com/val/ - .val() Returns: String, Number, Array)
[17:11:33] <iszak> shesek, never
[17:11:46] <shesek> So the documentation are wrong?
[17:12:02] <iszak> depends
[17:12:37] <iszak> I don't know if it'll never return a number, it may.
[17:12:43] <iszak> but it could be a string that has a number.
[17:12:55] <shesek> a string that has a number is still a string
[17:13:11] <shesek> they wouldn't write "Number" and mean that
[17:13:23] <iszak> I know.
[17:50:44] <coldhead> shesek: looking at the jQuery source, val() tests for typeof val === 'number' and converts it to a string
[17:50:50] <coldhead> so the docs must be wrong
[17:50:53] <coldhead> well spotted
[17:52:14] <shesek> The value originally comes from the browser's `value` attribute of input/option/button elements, won't that always be a string too? Some browsers returns a Number for numeric strings as the value?
[17:53:24] <coldhead> maybe some fruity html5 input?
[17:53:26] <coldhead> like a slider?
[17:55:24] <shesek> oh, yeah, that's possible
[17:55:55] <SvcGhost> Why do you suppose FireBug would lag really bad
[17:56:15] <shesek> Should I submit a bug to jQuery's Trac? How should errors on the documentation be reported?
[17:57:24] <shesek> Even tho, for a slider, it does make sense to return a number and not a string
[17:58:24] <coldhead> shesek: for doc bugs i like to tell hobs, danheberden or ajpiano
[17:58:35] <coldhead> or volunteer to fix it yourself
[17:58:40] <coldhead> i believe it's just a wiki
[17:59:00] <coldhead> i'm not allowed to update the site after the unpleasantness
[17:59:12] <shesek> unpleasantness?
[17:59:48] <coldhead> we must never speak of it
[18:00:02] <coldhead> let's just say not everyone shares my views on race
[18:00:04] <coldhead> and move on
[18:00:48] <shesek> hmm... okay -.-
[18:01:42] <shesek> there's a jquery-docs repository on github, but it seems like its still work in progress (almost none of the documentation is actually there)
[18:03:23] <coldhead> i wish hobs were here
[18:03:27] <coldhead> he fixes all that shit
[18:03:42] <coldhead> bot-t: tell hobs we miss you
[18:03:42] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[18:03:47] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[18:03:47] <bot-t> ;)
[18:10:28] <Liveman> Hey guys.. is it possible for me to do something like $(form).each() to run thorugh all the fields listed under the form, 1 by 1?

[18:24:18] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody
[18:24:26] <Germanaz0> someone knows how to handle timezones with javascript
[18:35:37] <sanduz2> I have a for loop, and within it I am using the jQuery.ajax function. The for loop runs through every loop before the ajax's success function gets run even once. Why is this?
[18:36:44] <coldhead> because the A in AJAX is for Asynchronous
[18:36:50] <coldhead> so it doesn't wait around
[18:37:47] <coldhead> it knows what it has to do when the AJAX request completes by using your success handler and it lets that shit get down to business while the rest of your javascript carries on with its life
[18:38:24] <sanduz2> i see, good explanation. thank you. what do you think a possible solution might be?
[18:38:55] <coldhead> you can disable the async
[18:38:57] <coldhead> but never ever do that
[18:39:08] <coldhead> it's better to rearrange your code so it doesn't depend on it
[18:39:16] <sanduz2> hmm
[18:39:29] <sanduz2> okay, that sounds reasonable. thank you so much :)
[18:39:48] <coldhead> if you want the calls to take place one after the other, make each success handler fire off the next request
[18:40:00] <coldhead> you might be able to find a beautifully elegant way to do that
[18:40:13] <sanduz2> ah, that does sound like an interesting use of recursion
[18:40:17] <sanduz2> ill consider that approach
[18:58:33] <josch0510> Does anybody know that jqueryUI themeroller still works on Firefox 6.0?
[18:59:09] <coldhead> it should!
[18:59:21] <coldhead> people will be very upset if it doesn't!
[19:00:57] <josch0510> but I cant use that on jqgrid demo site, it worked before = =a
[19:01:24] <josch0510> maybe I should try more
[19:53:33] <Nicolas_Leonida2> is there an equvanelt of appendTo for .after() ?
[20:07:35] * coldhead np: rumah sakit - scott & jeremiah
[20:10:47] <Nicolas_Leonida2> insertAfter was the answer :)
[20:11:03] <Nicolas_Leonida2>  $("#inputErrorMessageId").remove(); isn't this supposed to remove all elements of this id?
[20:13:13] <coldhead> Nicolas_Leonida2: IDs must be unique
[20:13:20] <coldhead> so it probably stops after it removes the first
[20:13:25] <coldhead> seeing as there should only be 1
[20:15:03] <Nicolas_Leonida2> yeah, I put div#input... and it worked
[20:15:05] <Nicolas_Leonida2> thanks
[20:15:36] <coldhead> you better make sure you don't have duplicate IDs
[20:15:42] <coldhead> or you're in big trouble, mister
[20:30:25] <cpgo> should a find('*').click(..) attach a click handler to every element?
[20:30:30] <cpgo> or how can I do that
[20:32:59] <Viper007Bond> this exists via third party: <a href="foo" class="clickme">click</a>  $('.clickme').click( alert('clicked'); return false; );   i'm trying to attach another func to that but the return false; is aborting my stuff.  $('.clickme').live('click', ... );  any way to work around w/o modifying third party?
[20:37:02] <Viper007Bond> going to of course yell at third party for using return false instead of preventDefault()
[20:37:03] <Eviltwin> Viper007Bond: $('.clickme').unbind('click')
[20:37:46] <Viper007Bond> Eviltwin: i want both funcs to fire. unbind, bind mind, bind theirs perhaps?
[20:38:01] <Eviltwin> Think that's your only option
[20:38:07] <Viper007Bond> alright. thanks.
[20:40:42] <cpgo> any way to add a click event to all ements?
[20:40:46] <cpgo> elements*
[20:41:40] <Viper007Bond> cpgo: wouldn't $('body').click( ... );  work?
[20:41:54] <Eviltwin> cpgo: It should
[20:43:46] <cpgo> ah yea
[20:43:59] <cpgo> I tried that but I was looking at currentTarget and it was always body, what I need is target
[20:44:00] <cpgo> thanks
[20:45:55] <cpgo> I'm making a (simple) live editor for a table, idk if I should have a click event on a sample table then open the editor or just have tag names and clicking that opens an editor. Its aimed more for non-technical people, what do you think
[20:48:27] <jrockjiggz> cpgo: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[20:50:01] <Mario_> Hello
[20:50:11] <cpgo> jrockjiggz, editing the look not content, live css editor (prolly some out there but its for a commerical site)
[20:50:34] <Mario_> Have you seen Luigi?
[20:52:11] <Mario_> We have to save the princess dSebastien
[21:33:26] <amoffat> hey, is there a nice syntax for applying a click handler to two sets of selector results?  ie  $("#header_links a").$("footer_links a").click(function(){ etc
[21:35:44] <tnorris> amoffat: $('#header_links a, #footer_links a')...
[21:36:07] <amoffat> tnorris, you rock, thanks :)
[21:36:10] <tnorris> np
[21:39:46] <cpgo> can you place an element on top of another one but still have :hover take affect of the element underneath? I just have a transparent div with 1px border overlay to show which element is selecting
[21:42:46] <tnorris> cpgo: you have to bind :hover to the first element, then detect whether it's hovering the needed element below.
[21:43:29] <cpgo> gah that's what I thought. k
[21:43:31] <cpgo> thanks
[21:47:04] <tnorris> cpgo: here's the solution I've used before: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4711023/how-to-make-this-javascript-much-faster/4711224#4711224
[21:49:35] <Spadeski> how do i make something slide down and left to open instead of down and right
[21:50:27] <cuqa> wat?
[21:50:55] <cpgo> tnorris, method 2?
[21:51:45] <tnorris> cpgo: either. depends on what you want to do. Check the links "Demo1" and "Demo2" which show what they do.
[21:52:48] <tnorris> Spadeski: I think you are talking about the default fadeOut() behavior, correct?
[21:53:12] <Spadeski> Not exactly just sliding though
[21:53:14] <Spadeski> slide in and out
[21:53:17] <Spadeski> notfade
[21:53:44] <cpgo> doesn't matter both do the job in terms of look, but method 2 would allow hover of the element below out of the box I'm assuming and I already have method 2 setup except its 1 div and not 4. I just need to get the hover of the element below working
[21:55:38] <tnorris> cpgo: yeah, that sounds right. let me know if you have any other questions.
[21:56:11] <cpgo> I just just go with method 2 and save me time .. but I wanna learn :P
[21:56:17] <cpgo> should just*
[21:56:36] <tnorris> Spadeski: so, start with width ~1px and grow height to full. Then grow width to full from right to left?
[21:57:23] <Spadeski> idk i dont even know jquery lol im just over here... like ya
[21:59:03] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:59:50] <astropirate> coldhead, what is this jquery you speak of?
[21:59:58] <Spadeski> dude
[22:00:05] <Spadeski> jquery is jquery
[22:00:14] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.101/WWRoot
[22:00:20] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.101/WWWRoot
[22:00:22] <Spadeski> Check that out
[22:05:00] <tnorris> Spadeski: loaded. what am I looking at?
[22:05:08] <Spadeski>  My website
[22:05:13] <Spadeski> just stuff i put together
[22:05:22] <Spadeski> need ideas....
[22:06:04] <tnorris> ah, ok. where did you want to use your dropdown?
[22:07:18] <wycks> how would one use an appendTo within a slideUp/slideDown without it repeating on each click, have a fiddle link if anyone is interested
[22:08:00] <wycks> http://jsfiddle.net/VAZCb/
[22:09:27] <tnorris> wycks: your order is just incorrect: http://jsfiddle.net/VAZCb/1/
[22:10:05] <wycks> ah thanks know it was something simple
[22:10:08] <wycks> knew*
[22:12:25] <tnorris> heh, yeah. we've all been there. simple things throw can throw off the best of us.
[22:18:42] <cpgo> tnorris, how exactly do I get the bottom element to hover, do I call hover() inside the hover event for the overlay or what
[22:19:24] <cpgo> lol give me a sec just noticed what I said is totally wrong
[22:21:56] <cpgo> yeah still dont get it
[22:23:52] <cpgo> tried trigger('mouseover'); for the current target, nothing
[22:31:07] <tnorris> cpgo: you bind hover on the overlay element.
[22:31:22] <tnorris> the key from the link I sent you is in "document.elementFromPoint"
[22:31:49] <cpgo> I did it in mouseover of the overlay, isn't that the same thing?
[22:32:46] <cpgo> do I need to add a css class to it or can I active the :hover in my css (doing it with .hover works)
[22:33:44] <tnorris> it depends on how your overlay exists. here's the page on mouseover: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover
[22:34:23] <tnorris> what I mean is, is your overlay larger than the element it's covering?
[22:34:35] <cpgo> tnorris, same size
[22:34:59] <tnorris> ok, then yeah. mouseover should work.
[22:35:42] <tnorris> and I would add a class to the child element. don't know a reliable way of triggering :hover on an element via javascript.
[22:35:53] <cpgo> ok
[22:36:04] <cpgo> its working with the class (cant get it to work w/o it)
[23:09:12] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[23:09:43] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Mod of the channel now?
[23:10:25] <astropirate> No, he is just a puppet for the powers that be
[23:10:32] <wkmanire> :D
[23:15:46] <wkmanire> astropirate: What is an astropirate?
[23:16:08] <astropirate> wkmanire, Astro Pirate  = Space Pirate
[23:16:13] <astropirate> arg!!!!
[23:17:05] <wkmanire> astropirate: Oh kind of like those weird bug guys I had to escape from when Ridley took over the space station?
[23:17:26] <astropirate> hmmm
[23:17:52] <astropirate> no its a guy with a wooden leg and a patch over one of his eyes and he is pirating the interstellar shipping lanes :S
[23:18:10] <wkmanire> But Han Solo didn't have a wooden leg or a missing eye.
[23:18:10] <wkmanire> :(
[23:18:33] <astropirate> wkmanire, he was a smugler not a pirate
[23:18:39] <wkmanire> What's the difference?
[23:18:58] <wkmanire> meh
[23:19:02] <astropirate> smuglers smugle things without the authorities knowing and pirates steal things
[23:19:18] <wkmanire> Well, that's true.
[23:19:20] <wkmanire> You're right.
[23:19:41] <wkmanire> But good smugglers don't drop their payload at the first sign of authority intervention.
[23:19:50] <wkmanire> Man, this channel is quiet tonight.
[23:20:12] <coldhead> no it isn't
[23:20:18] <wkmanire> Sup coldhead.
[23:20:24] <coldhead> hiii
[23:21:01] <wkmanire> I need to come here more often.
[23:21:12] <wkmanire> The#python guys keep beating me up.
[23:21:48] <astropirate> man, this Gnome3 setup of mine looks soooooo sexy
[23:21:56] <wkmanire> astropirate: Pic?
[23:22:07] <astropirate> pictures can't capture the awesomeness
[23:22:12] <astropirate> i'll have to make a video
[23:22:13] <wkmanire> coldhead: I checked out coffeescript finally. I think I'm officially a fan.
[23:22:21] <astropirate> NOOO
[23:22:28] <wkmanire> astropirate: Vid? just doesn't roll off the fingers right.
[23:22:28] <astropirate> coffee script is for the week minded!
[23:22:38] <astropirate> *weak
[23:22:40] <wkmanire> astropirate: It is not! It is for the lazy!
[23:22:46] <wkmanire> Not the weekly thinkers.
[23:22:48] <coldhead> typos are for the week minded
[23:22:52] <astropirate> :(
[23:23:23] <astropirate> coffeescript is a perverted attempt at making JavaScript be more like Ruby
[23:23:53] <wkmanire> astropirate: Have something against ruby?
[23:24:01] <wkmanire> astropirate: Actually coffeescript is more like Python.
[23:24:12] <wkmanire> astropirate: Except Python is more verbose.
[23:24:15] <astropirate> wkmanire,  no, just that JavaScript != Ruby
[23:24:25] <wkmanire> wkmanire: JavaScript !== Ruby?
[23:24:31] <wkmanire> I'm talking to myself now
[23:24:34] <coldhead> can't blame people for wanting JS to look like something that took more than a weekend to invent
[23:24:35] <wkmanire> Man this is some good Brandy.
[23:24:53] <astropirate> coldhead, sure i can blame them
[23:25:08] <astropirate> javascript is sexy
[23:25:09] <wkmanire> astropirate: It really was invented in a pretty short time period. Isn't that how the story goes?
[23:25:11] <wkmanire> 6 months or so?
[23:25:26] <astropirate> it has its flaws but it is over all pretty damn sexy
[23:25:32] <astropirate> specially on Node.js
[23:26:01] <wkmanire> astropirate: Javascript is probably my hands down favorite language. I like that coffee script lets me think in simpler terms, thats all.
[23:26:21] <astropirate> wkmanire, are you an apple fan?
[23:26:33] <wkmanire> astropirate: If you write enough javascript you end up writing a lot of Coffee Script in the end anyway.
[23:26:45] <wkmanire> astropirate: No, I work to hard to pay that much for Unix.
[23:26:49] <wkmanire> too*
[23:26:51] <astropirate> wkmanire, nahh I do write a lot of javascript :)
[23:28:05] <tnorris> wtf, on the coffescript homepage they aligned all the coffescript variables and objects, but not the js counterpart. what a blatant fuckary.
[23:28:55] <wkmanire> tnorris: Tchuck?
[23:29:01] <astropirate> tnorris, you mean line spaces?
[23:29:11] <tnorris> astropirate: yeah.
[23:29:23] <tnorris> wkmanire: that's my grandpa.
[23:29:33] <wkmanire> tnorris:  Their examples are designed to make CoffeeScript look good. It really is fun to work with if you do any functional work though.
[23:29:41] <astropirate> tnorris, true  but that isn'ta showing the js equivelent its showing the generated code
[23:30:31] <tnorris> ah, missed that "output on the right." bit at the top.
[23:31:09] <wkmanire> I heard that firefox was gonna support debugging of CoffeeScript pretty soon.
[23:31:25] <wkmanire> or is.
[23:31:29] <astropirate> yup so are a few others
[23:31:34] <astropirate> chrome most likely
[23:31:47] <wkmanire> Chrome will continue to do whatever is popular I think.
[23:31:48] <wkmanire> Which is good.
[23:31:58] <astropirate> coffeescript is popular?
[23:31:59] <astropirate> :S
[23:32:08] <wkmanire> Well it at least qualifies as a fad.
[23:32:14] <astropirate> heh
[23:32:15] <wkmanire> coldhead: What do you think? popular vs fad?
[23:32:41] <tnorris> I work with some java devs that think js is a fad.
[23:32:53] <astropirate> LOLOL
[23:33:02] <wkmanire> tnorris: Some people in #haskell call OOP a fad *shrugs*
[23:33:09] <astropirate> lol
[23:33:10] <coldhead> it's as much a fad as HAML and SASS
[23:33:11] <tnorris> lol, awesomeness.
[23:33:16] <coldhead> people are doing real work in it
[23:33:18] <coldhead> getting paid
[23:33:33] <coldhead> people will be happy to use it until something better comes along
[23:33:38] <coldhead> node.js is just a fad though
[23:33:45] <astropirate> how dare you sir
[23:34:18] <coldhead> node.js isn't enterprise
[23:34:20] * coldhead trolls
[23:34:21] <astropirate> Node.js didn't become a super hit ove right it has been building up for the past 30is years
[23:34:21] <tnorris> i would agree only if ruby, php, etc. got faster.
[23:34:25] <wkmanire> ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[23:34:31] <wkmanire> coldhead: Literally laughing out loud here.
[23:34:33] <astropirate> *3ish
[23:34:49] <coldhead> jruby is faster than node.js now
[23:35:32] <tnorris> (checking sources)
[23:35:53] <coldhead> {citation needed}
[23:35:58] <wkmanire> I don't think there is any doubt that memory managed dynamic languages are teh foooture.
[23:36:09] <wkmanire> But who knows how long that future will be.
[23:36:14] <coldhead> http://twitter.com/#!/headius/status/110391814569197568
[23:36:15] <socialhapy>  Tweet from headius: JRuby matches Node.js requests/second and Java doubles it in this simple experiment: http://t.co/F6xsaSE  http://bit.ly/q8uxf5
[23:36:17] <_serial_>  /join ##java,##php,#web
[23:36:18] <wkmanire> We'll probably be calling all of our best code "shit" in 5 years.
[23:36:29] <astropirate> coldhead, again, its going to be threaded. The whole point node.js is making is that it is event based and hence can handle more connections per system resources
[23:36:40] <astropirate> but i don't really care much abotu that
[23:36:47] <astropirate> i care that its JavaScript on the server
[23:36:51] <coldhead> yes astropirate but is it enterprise
[23:36:56] <coldhead> no, no it isn't
[23:37:03] <astropirate> coldhead, what makes it 'enterprise' is the libraries
[23:37:05] <astropirate> not the language itself
[23:37:08] <wkmanire> coldhead: Yahoo is probably the biggest player cited as using it right?
[23:37:20] <coldhead> what makes it enterprise is how nice the suits its developers wear are
[23:37:43] <tnorris> and for that reason I never want to learn java.
[23:37:50] <astropirate> coldhead, so if its not enterprise its a fad? o_O
[23:37:59] <wkmanire> tnorris: Not wanting to learn a language for a reason like that is invalid.
[23:38:06] <wkmanire> Lots of smarts go into any language's creation
[23:38:19] <coldhead> no no, i'm just trolling. node.js is an elegant solution to the problem of "not enough callbacks" on the server
[23:38:53] <tnorris> wkmanire: I say that tongue-in-cheek. there are so many other reasons I won't learn java.
[23:38:57] <coldhead> i still think the future of the server is on the JVM. jruby, clojure, javascript, perl6, whatever, but all on the jvm
[23:39:08] <astropirate> coldhead, callbacks are not a problem if you are doing it right. if you aren't doing it right then you will screw up no matter what  platform you are on
[23:39:21] <wkmanire> astropirate: LOL
[23:39:49] <wkmanire> When software development is as old as masonry we'll be able to say what is right and wrong.
[23:39:54] <wkmanire> We're all just newbs still.
[23:40:06] <astropirate> speak for yourself
[23:40:07] <astropirate> <_<
[23:40:08] <astropirate> jk
[23:40:30] <wkmanire> All we really know so far is what works for certain industries and what doesn't.
[23:40:32] <coldhead> i am happy that for people who love JS there is node.js on their servers, and for people who don't love JS there is coffeescript
[23:40:46] <wkmanire> coldhead: I'm kind of a swinger I guess then.
[23:40:52] <wkmanire> coldhead: I love 'em both.
[23:41:11] <coldhead> it's a golden age for you then
[23:41:11] <astropirate> :O is that possible?
[23:41:52] <wkmanire> astropirate: Go learn you a haskell. You'll change your tune.
[23:41:59] <wkmanire> astropirate: Or you'll hate haskell.
[23:42:03] <wkmanire> he he he he
[23:42:47] <coldhead> i wonder if anyone has ever hated haskell
[23:42:53] <wkmanire> Time to filter the brandy. back in a flash
[23:43:05] <coldhead> surely it gives you a kind of stockholm syndrome
[23:43:11] <coldhead> like a long terrible marriage
[23:43:11] <astropirate> haha
[23:43:18] <coldhead> "it was so hard, i must really love him"
[23:45:54] <Thomas`-> hi all. does anyone know how to dynamically load a css script and determine when it has finished parsing?
[23:47:51] <coldhead> i think it's quite hard to do across browsers, Thomas`-
[23:47:52] <coldhead> http://jaubourg.net/feature-testing-impossible-data-uri-and-defer
[23:48:03] <wkmanire> Is css a script or a data format?
[23:48:03] <coldhead> that has some relevant problems
[23:50:47] <wkmanire> Wow
[23:50:56] <wkmanire> It is amazing that English is not this guy's native language
[23:51:31] <coldhead> yeah he writes beautifully
[23:51:37] <coldhead> bastard
[23:53:48] <wkmanire> coldhead: I had the pleasure of watching a talk he did in person on the new ajax stuff. Thick accent, but he really does speak like he writes.
[23:54:03] <wkmanire> I'm pretty sure he didn't memorize it ahead of time.
[23:54:46] <coldhead> he has a beautiful accent
[23:54:53] <coldhead> he was on yayquery a few episodes back
[23:55:06] <wkmanire> I think I saw that episode.
[23:55:23] <wkmanire> Although I'm guessing he has been a guest more than once
[23:55:34] <wkmanire> Or at least will be more than once in the future.
[23:55:47] <coldhead> i think it's just been the one so far
[23:56:32] <wkmanire> Man, this bowl of beans sure is tasty.
