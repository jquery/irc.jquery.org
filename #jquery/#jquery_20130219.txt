[00:31:42] <mazzachre> Does the jQueryUI sortable work within sortables? Recursivly? As in I make a list of lists sortable and they each have items that are sortable?
[00:37:58] <ravenzz> so if I understood correctly blur, focus, load adn unload don't bubble up. Now in vanilla JS that's true, but in jQuery seems to be not... so $(document).on('blur', 'input', function () { }); works. Does jquery provides a workaround for that?
[00:40:22] <Cork> mazzachre: yes, it "works", my experience is that it is a big buggy though
[00:41:08] <Cork> ravenzz: workaround?
[00:41:15] <Cork> why do you need a workaround?
[00:41:25] <ravenzz> no I don't need it
[00:41:42] <Cork> the workaround is "don't use that if you don't want it"
[00:41:44] <ravenzz> I am wondering why blur bubbles up
[00:42:01] <Cork> or use event.target === this
[00:42:22] <ravenzz> why jQuery make possible to do event delegation with blur/focus and some others
[00:42:23] <Cork> but no, theres no way to disable it as far as i know
[00:42:35] <Cork> ravenzz: why not?
[00:42:47] <Cork> else you couldn't delegate it
[00:42:58] <ravenzz> you could using focusout/in ?
[00:43:00] <tw2113> clearly this just makes jQuery the asshole reletive
[00:43:03] <tw2113> relative*
[00:43:13] <mazzachre> Cork: How, buggy?
[00:43:16] <Cork> ravenzz: but then you would have to bind an event listener to every element that produce it
[00:43:31] <Cork> mazzachre: problem with dropping then at the start of a child list
[00:43:34] <Cork> and so on
[00:43:47] <ravenzz> I don't really know why JS has either the one that bubbles up (focusout) and the one that doesn't (blur) but still
[00:44:13] <ravenzz> Cork if I understood correctly with focusout you can do event delegation
[00:44:23] <ravenzz> since it is propagated to its parents
[00:44:26] <ravenzz> with blur you can't
[00:44:48] <ravenzz> but besides that they do the same thing
[00:44:52] <Cork> ravenzz: focusout isn't cross browser
[00:44:54] <ravenzz> don't they?
[00:44:55] <ravenzz> k
[00:44:58] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, I will make a fiddle and play with it, just to see...
[00:45:12] <Cork> ravenzz: or rather it works in ie and webkit
[00:45:31] <Cork> and that, nowdays means most browsers :/
[00:45:44] <Cork> (as presto is dead)
[00:46:00] <ravenzz> yeah, ie support is fine
[00:46:09] <ravenzz> ff > 7 too
[00:46:29] <Cork> uh... nope
[00:46:30] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=687787
[00:46:51] <Cork> not unless you use a lib that fakes it
[00:47:00] <ravenzz> I am not saying that it is a bad thing that jQuery adds it
[00:47:44] <ravenzz> just make sure that what I knew was right (the vanilla version)
[00:48:01] <Cork> ravenzz: ya, the vanilla version bubbles, but doesn't work in gecko
[00:48:10] <Cork> so its not cross browser
[00:48:46] <ravenzz> alright so how does jQuery emulates the bubbling? captureEvent?
[00:48:57] <Cork> not sure actually
[00:49:02] <Cork> would have to check
[00:49:09] <ravenzz> np I can do that myself
[00:49:12] <nocturne7> why would anyone do something like this $('#el').click(function(event){event.preventDefault();/* ... */})? why is the author trying to prevent the default click action ?
[00:49:23] <Cork> well i want to know too; haven't cared before
[00:50:27] <nocturne7> I got this from item 9 here http://goo.gl/pLtr
[00:50:42] <Cork> ravenzz: ok, so firstly it uses 'delegateType: "focusout"' for blur
[00:50:47] <mkoks> nocturne7 maybe he was just had strange ideas :D
[00:50:58] <Nemurenai> nocturne7, I'm guessing that they have some triggers on sub elements and don't want the click event to bubble up above the parent?
[00:51:00] <mkoks> *without was
[00:52:02] <nocturne7> Nemurenai: hmm, in that case they would probably prefer "preventPropogation()"
[00:52:17] <ravenzz> Cork yep I saw that, and then there should be some polyfill for the ones that don't support focusout right?
[00:52:28] <Cork> ravenzz: and it uses jquery.event.special to add event listeners directly to the target elements as they are added to the dom
[00:52:42] <Cork> ravenzz: ya, check for if ( !jQuery.support.focusinBubbles ) {
[00:52:49] <Nemurenai> nocturne7, yeah. Disregard what I said, I'm a noob..or something
[00:54:24] <ravenzz> Cork ok so if the browser doesn't support focusout, there won't be a real event delegation
[00:54:34] <Cork> ravenzz: they will
[00:54:39] <ravenzz> ah yes
[00:54:45] <Cork> but each element for the target that is added to the browser
[00:54:50] <Cork> an event listener will be added
[00:55:02] <Cork> that makes a simulated event bubbling
[00:55:11] <ravenzz> well I was meant to say something like that :p
[00:55:42] <ravenzz> so in terms of event handlers it would be the same as of attaching it directly to each element
[00:55:56] <ravenzz> event listeners*
[00:56:24] <Cork> ravenzz: and it have a very vage memory that they added focusout instead of just changing blur was cause old pages would break
[00:56:41] <Cork> ravenzz: well you would actually get one additional event listener
[00:56:58] <Cork> one for the delegation, and one for every element that it matches
[00:57:24] <ravenzz> oh of course
[00:58:04] <Cork> nocturne7: btw its stopPropagation not prevent
[01:09:57] <grange> hey. I am trying to remotely dial a phone number using jquery .ajax() method. The problem now is that the server prompts for user name and password, even if I pass the username and password parameters in the .ajax() call. Neither username nor password is sent when inspecting the url the request goes to.
[01:12:28] <grange> here is the function I am trying to get fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/Ej8Qu/
[01:12:29] <grange> thank you
[01:16:57] <dblosevn> hey, is there anyway i can find all broken images on a page and replace there src with another image?
[01:17:23] <computer2000> help! i am trying to modify a link with ampersands in it but when it gets rendered all ampersands are %26, is it an encoding problem?
[01:18:42] <dblosevn> your urlencoding your entire url
[01:19:45] <dblosevn> $(yourel).href(decodeURIComponent($(yourel).attr('href')))
[01:19:59] <dblosevn> see if that fixes it
[01:20:04] <dblosevn> @ computer2000
[01:21:06] <computer2000> dblosevn: theres no method href
[01:22:48] <dblosevn> oops
[01:23:15] <dblosevn> $(yourel).attr('href', (decodeURIComponent($(yourel).attr('href'))))
[01:25:29] <computer2000> dblosevn: still doesnt work, all i get is %26
[01:26:24] <dblosevn> your replacing `yourel` with an actual selector right?
[01:31:46] <djQuery> anyone see a better way of doing this. https://gist.github.com/djQuery/794aa80969e7d6ad2959
[01:32:12] <Cork> grange: i suspect they'r using basic auth on the server side
[01:33:48] <fat> I want to put this fiddle onto my website http://jsfiddle.net/frabiacca/7pM7h/5/ but if i put it, my floating bar doesn't work! http://uploadnow.org/image/344582-snapshot1.png
[01:33:48] <grange> yes thx, with encodeURI instead of passing username, password, everything works ;)
[01:34:12] <Cork> grange: uh, encode uri??
[01:34:22] <Cork> grange: sounds like your doing it wrong
[01:34:44] <Cork> if it works with encodeuri you most likely want to add it to the data: {} object
[01:34:51] <Cork> and it would just work
[01:35:38] <Cork> grange: but i would say a page that allows calling a number over http with no auth at all, scares me a bit
[01:37:55] <fat> help?
[01:39:42] <grange> Cork: no, passing it to the data-object does not work
[01:39:56] <grange> jquery API says that username/password as parameters is for bypassing htaccess auth
[01:40:25] <grange> what is wrong with encodeURI('http://username:password@....'); ?
[01:41:02] <Cork> eh...
[01:41:41] <Cork> grange: use beforeSend and xhr.setRequestHeader
[01:41:52] <grange> I tried that before, with no luck :/
[01:42:14] <grange> well, let's try again
[01:42:35] <Cork> are you btoa the tooken?

[01:54:01] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help with this? http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/cZgVK/1/
[01:54:11] <serdem> i'm trying to make multiple divs selectable and draggable. here what am working on http://jsfiddle.net/zZTfA/139/
[01:54:19] <serdem> help me too please :)
[01:55:14] <serdem> delboy1978uk, oh your problme is dragging too :)
[01:55:23] <serdem> problem* problme
[01:55:29] <grange> Cork: wasn't aware of this fact ;)
[01:55:55] <delboy1978uk> serdem try this: $(".item").draggable({filter:"div"});
[01:57:30] <serdem> delboy1978uk, in this case selecting works but dragging works for the first element
[01:57:54] <serdem> others not moving
[01:58:00] <delboy1978uk> they all moved for me!
[01:58:56] <grange> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/Ej8Qu/6/
[01:59:22] <grange> hope I did it right. Nothing happens except of "clicked" log... that's what happened before also :/
[02:00:04] <serdem> delboy1978uk, really?
[02:00:12] <serdem> would you pass me the link please?
[02:00:48] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/zZTfA/141/
[02:01:05] <delboy1978uk> how do i trigger a function when a div gets a certain class?
[02:02:26] <serdem> delboy1978uk, nah,dragging stil doesn't work. which browser are you using?
[02:02:37] <delboy1978uk> safari. u?
[02:02:59] <serdem> delboy1978uk, chrome
[02:03:10] <delboy1978uk> hmm strange chrome is usually good
[02:03:19] <delboy1978uk> thought you were gonna say firefox
[02:03:30] <delboy1978uk> i prayed u werent about to say ie
[02:03:33] <serdem> delboy1978uk, yeah. let me try it.
[02:04:36] <serdem> delboy1978uk, haha, firefox doesn't seem to work too
[02:07:09] <Two4> topic needs to change, jquery is at 1.9.1 now
[02:08:04] <Two4> anyway, I need to change assign a stylesheet to a new window I open via window.open(), would anyone have a suggestion how I could do this via jquery?
[02:10:16] <johanhar> isnt possible to make a jQuery element with a template of HTML and not just ONE tag?
[02:10:24] <Cork> grange: gah, sorry took me ages to realize your using jsonp
[02:10:30] <Cork> so ya you can't use the xhr object >_<'
[02:10:37] <Cork> as you'r not using it...
[02:10:43] <johanhar> like var $row = $("<tr><td>...</td> lots of html etc</tr>")
[02:10:44] <johanhar> ?
[02:11:21] <Two4> johanhar, you're describing something akin to an htmlString there
[02:11:21] <Cork> johanhar: yes
[02:11:30] <grange> Cork, do you have another way of doing it? I found this code fragment when searching for a way how to do a cross-domain request
[02:11:48] <Cork> grange: no for a script src url your only way is to encode it in the request url
[02:11:50] <johanhar> Two4: but it doesn't work..
[02:11:54] <mazzachre> Cork: Seems to work OK http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/4x8bU/
[02:12:16] <Two4> johanhar, yes, I think your syntax is off
[02:12:25] <Cork> mazzachre: thats not the solution i was talking of
[02:12:32] <Two4> I'm not one for that though, I'm a newb myself
[02:12:39] <Cork> mazzachre: think of a tree structure of ul>li>ul>li's
[02:12:45] <Cork> THAT is buggy
[02:12:56] <mazzachre> Cork: Ah... But I had headlines :)
[02:13:06] <Cork> ya, and that should work fine
[02:13:41] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, ya, I can imagine tree structures with sortable would be... uhm... confusing :) But I don't know how they would be to use? :)
[02:13:56] <Cork> grange: to explain what i mean; jsonp uses <script> tags to do the call, so you don't have a xhr object to set any headers on
[02:13:58] <johanhar> Two4: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/27e39233aad696a763ec
[02:14:36] <Cork> mazzachre: dropping an li at the beginning or an ul thats a child of an li is really hard to make work well
[02:14:51] <grange> ah ok didn't know but it definitively makes sense. But without jsonp, the request won't work right?
[02:14:54] <Cork> you get flickering where the li jumps before the parent li and into the ul and what not
[02:14:59] <grange> becuase of the same-origin-policy
[02:15:05] <Cork> grange: yes
[02:15:15] <Cork> jsonp is the reason that fails
[02:15:36] <johanhar> can someone please help?
[02:15:36] <johanhar> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/27e39233aad696a763ec
[02:15:49] <grange> and without jsonp, I get "permission denied" :)
[02:15:55] <grange> so encodeURI is the only way to go?!
[02:16:25] <Cork> grange: ya, you can set cors on the server, but that doens't work i ie
[02:16:31] <Cork> *work in ie
[02:17:28] <grange> ok as it is just a backend-thing for my colleagues, that wouldn't matter. but I think the encodeURI stuff is just fine because security does not matter here. thank you for your time & help!
[02:18:20] <marcoslhc> johanhar: you are using a htmlstring as a selector. its not how it works
[02:18:26] <Cork> grange: well it was me insisting on a solution that didn't work so... :)
[02:18:53] <Cork> marcoslhc: no thats htmlfragment parsing
[02:18:56] <johanhar> marcoslhc: how should I do it then?
[02:18:58] <Cork> and thats just fine
[02:19:41] <Cork> johanhar: in what code file do you get the exception?
[02:20:09] <Cork> is it inside jquery or in your file?
[02:20:42] <marcoslhc> Cork: ok, sorry.
[02:20:53] <johanhar> Cork: jquery
[02:22:23] <Cork> wow... my browser crashed...
[02:23:29] <Cork> johanhar: http://jsfiddle.net/tVKdf/
[02:23:31] <Cork> wfm
[02:24:41] <johanhar> Cork: the HTML comes from a string, not the document
[02:24:52] <Cork> johanhar: so does it here too
[02:24:59] <Cork> $('textarea').val() <-- a string of html
[02:25:16] <johanhar> so $($(htmlstring))?
[02:25:30] <Cork> no that would dubble wrapp it
[02:25:41] <Cork> my point is the html string isn't the problem
[02:25:44] <Cork> its something else
[02:25:57] <johanhar> hmm, ok
[02:25:58] <Cork> do you have a testcase that actually triggers it?
[02:26:18] <Cork> and preferable a live one :)
[02:26:57] <johanhar> sorry, no.
[02:27:04] <johanhar> I'll find a workaround
[02:33:14] <MalMen> with jquery how can i get hte value of a $_GET[""] ?
[02:33:34] <MalMen> for example http://foo.com/index.php?id=33
[02:33:42] <MalMen> on javascript var getid = 33
[02:34:43] <nathanbz> anyone know how to dynamically position a fancybox
[02:34:52] <nathanbz> $('.fancybox-wrap').css({ 'top': e.pageY, 'left': e.pageX});
[02:34:56] <nathanbz> isn't working :(
[02:36:29] <nathanbz> or recommend me somethinkg like fancybox and will popup a div at my current mouse position
[02:36:37] <fALSO> Hi there!
[02:36:39] <nathanbz> with modals and all that jazz
[02:37:05] <Cork> MalMen: window.location.query
[02:37:27] <delboy1978uk> nathanbz have u tried bootstrap?
[02:37:29] <Cork> MalMen: opps sorry its .search
[02:37:49] <grange> MalMen: here is some code if it helps: http://staticfloat.com/javascript/javascript-auf-get-parameter-in-der-url-zugreifen/
[02:38:12] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/cZgVK/1/ slidetoggle when dragging over something?
[02:38:55] <hughaj> I have  a weird thing going on, I have a generated list from an array of an object, some data stored in data attributes. I haven't used .data because it doesn't seem to be working in safari and ie8 which are requirements, however prop is working. But when accessing the LI through $(this) in a click event it doesn't read the same element as if I click it off the DOM viewer, it is missing the...
[02:38:56] <hughaj> ...data properties. Example of the code here (not functional) http://jsfiddle.net/Qe5Vx/
[02:39:01] <hughaj> any ideas?
[02:41:00] <Cork> hughaj: you most likely want to use attr for data- attributes
[02:41:07] <Cork> prop is for properties
[02:41:11] <MalMen> thnks :)
[02:41:16] <hughaj> attr isn't working in ie8
[02:41:20] <Cork> it is
[02:41:42] <Cork> else i have a patched ie cause my sites work well with it
[02:41:48] <hughaj> prop works in all other parts of the code attr didnt return in other locations where this works, prop was the only way I got it working in all browsers at present (using 1.9.0
[02:42:05] <Cork> hughaj: attr is for getting attributes on the dom element
[02:42:11] <hughaj> attr is returning undefined
[02:42:12] <Cork> and data- should be attributes
[02:42:16] <AdamPDotty> or setting
[02:42:20] <Cork> then your not using jquery
[02:42:52] <hughaj> and $(this) isn't showing the properties in the dom inspector, but if I select the element with firebug for example it does show in the dom inspector
[02:43:11] <hughaj> is it because $(this) is returning a jquery object and the jquery object doesn't see these as data attributes?
[02:43:23] <nathanbz> delboy1976uk  bootstrap as in twitters framework thing, isn't that abit over kill ?
[02:44:02] <kostodo> how would I inject onClick="return true" into an <a> ?
[02:44:44] <Cork> kostodo: you shouldn't
[02:44:55] <Cork> kostodo: event attributes is a plain to handle
[02:45:06] <Cork> as it gives all kind of weird behaviors
[02:45:11] <AdamPDotty> a.on('click', handler); handler returning true
[02:45:20] <Cork> you should REALLY be using event listeners instead ^
[02:45:25] <kostodo> Cork: I'm having trouble with a css hover menu on the iPad (the hover is breaking it)
[02:45:43] <Cork> kostodo: return true won't fix that
[02:45:49] <hughaj> Cork, do you have another idea on $(this) not matching the directly selected dom element? attr doesn't work either
[02:45:56] <kostodo> Cork: what will?
[02:45:56] <AdamPDotty> css is not even jquery
[02:46:16] <Cork> kostodo: set a class and in the css override the :hover
[02:46:37] <kostodo> override the hover with what??
[02:46:38] <Cork> :hover {} .clicked { /*default action */ }
[02:46:55] <Cork> well not action default style
[02:47:28] <Cork> hmm actially no you need :hover { /* hover style */ } .clicked:hover { /* default style */ }
[02:47:41] <kostodo> How come Chrome on Android handles it fine‚Ä¶ but iOS does not.
[02:48:00] <Cork> that return true makes it work?
[02:48:06] <Cork> sounds like some form of hack chrome uses
[02:48:18] <kostodo> Cork: why would .clicked:hover have any effect? it's still a :hover
[02:48:22] <Cork> just write your css correctly and it will just work
[02:49:05] <Cork> kostodo: ex => a, a.clicked:hover { background-color: blue; } a:hover { background-color: red; }
[02:49:41] <kostodo> But i'm telling you that the mobile safari is not registering the :hover state
[02:49:59] <kostodo> Because you can't hover in touch
[02:50:14] <Cork> ah, though you wanted the other direction
[02:50:25] <Cork> well then you will have to add the class on touchstart
[02:50:31] <Cork> and remove it on touchend
[02:50:46] <nathanbz> is there an event you can catch when a div gets made visable
[02:50:46] <Cork> and move the class to the same place as the :hover
[02:50:53] <Cork> nathanbz: no
[02:53:15] <nathanbz> is there an event when a click event is complete ?
[02:54:17] <Cork> nathanbz: the click event is when the click is complete
[02:54:22] <Cork> mousedown is when it starts
[02:54:45] <Cork> or rather mousedown > mouseup > click
[02:55:26] <nathanbz> no use :/
[02:55:39] <nathanbz> i don't know why but fancybox just doesn't let me dyanmically position it
[02:56:34] <Cork> nathanbz: prob cause it happens in click
[02:56:36] <nathanbz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3197877/how-to-position-fancybox-on-top
[02:56:38] <nathanbz> doesnt work :/
[02:57:03] <Cork> its onComplete doesn't work?
[02:57:11] <nathanbz> doesn't do anything for me
[02:57:22] <nathanbz> I put an alert in it
[02:57:26] <nathanbz> and nothing comes up
[02:57:44] <nathanbz> well the fancybox comes up but the alert doesn't show
[02:58:04] <Cork> well its in the api doc http://fancybox.net/api
[02:58:10] <Cork> so it should work
[02:59:11] <Cork> ah, are you using fancybox2?
[02:59:23] <nathanbz> no 1.3.4
[02:59:50] <Cork> then it should work
[03:00:01] <nathanbz> http://pastebin.com/nNQCPkPb
[03:00:08] <nathanbz> am i just doing something wrong ?
[03:08:43] <nathanbz> how do u get the current mouse position
[03:18:00] <kostodo> Cork: you still there?
[03:18:12] <kostodo> All the docs I read online say to include onClick=‚Äùreturn true‚Äù in the a
[03:18:19] <kostodo> How would I inject that with jQuery?
[03:26:36] <nathanbz> fancybox is taking years from my life
[03:27:46] <nathanbz> onComplete runs
[03:28:01] <nathanbz> centers the fancybox, moves it to my postion then re-centers it
[03:46:41] <alexut> i want to add to remove the class of an element when clicking outside of it: i tried this but it dosen't seem to work : http://jsfiddle.net/alexut/AJtpt/ if anyone can give me a hint or a solution i'd apreciate.
[04:16:31] <Cork> kostodo: am now
[04:16:47] <kostodo> Cork: been playing with touchstart
[04:16:52] <kostodo> but not really working out
[04:17:05] <Cork> kostodo: $().on('click', function() { return true; });
[04:17:10] <kostodo> I can see the drop down appear quickly and then disappear
[04:17:13] <Cork> but i don't see how that would change anything
[04:17:21] <kostodo> i tried the return true and it works
[04:17:36] <kostodo> with .attr('onClick', 'return true')
[04:17:45] <Cork> na, don't use inline event attribute
[04:17:56] <Cork> if you ever want to actually use the click event it would suck
[04:17:58] <kostodo> the problem with that is that its impossible to get rid of the drop down once it pops up
[04:18:12] <kostodo> you're stick in the drop down display
[04:18:48] <Cork> touchstart and then catching if you move onto child elements should fix it
[04:18:55] <Cork> but, haven't ever tried it
[04:23:03] <philhutchinson> alexut: http://jsfiddle.net/AJtpt/7/
[04:24:43] <philhutchinson> is that what you wanted alexut ?
[04:24:54] <alexut> yep :D
[04:25:02] <alexut> thanks!
[04:25:07] <philhutchinson> no problem
[04:39:04] <dblosevn> Hey, does jquery have a builtin method to test if 2 objects are equal?
[04:39:54] <dblosevn> Want to compare if my form data is dirty or not and i have 2 arrays one of the state at page load and the second as of now
[04:42:12] <mazzachre> dblosevn: it should be fairly easy to make a deep compare with $.each...
[04:42:36] <dblosevn> ya im getting lazy again, been at it too long
[04:43:12] <dblosevn> its just 2 one dimensional arrays lol
[04:43:32] <dblosevn> was hoping for var equals = $.equals(arr1, arr2); :-)
[04:43:49] <kostodo> Corkkkkkkkkkk!
[04:43:51] <kostodo> I'm stuck!
[04:43:53] <kostodo> ;)
[04:44:10] <dblosevn> kostodo: find some butter?
[04:44:29] <kostodo> iOS butter
[04:44:39] <kostodo> unfortunately theres only Android butter here
[04:48:35] <dblosevn> i was thinking its slippery so maybe if you rub it on yourself you could get unstuck lmao
[04:48:43] <seutje> dblosevn: if it's a form ur trying to compare, might be interesting to serialize and compare the serialized string, since u can sorta assume the order will be identical
[04:49:27] <seutje> but yeah, objects aren't equal unless they reference the same object
[04:49:40] <Nebros> how can i have changing colors in a loop? (white, grey, white...) http://jsfiddle.net/JBNRj/
[04:49:57] <seutje> ?eval  {} == {}
[04:50:31] <dblosevn> true, i went through all the trouble of making a function that turned the form into an object [{field: value}] but i guess i could just compare the string :-)
[04:51:01] <dblosevn> seutje: think you broke the bot :-)
[04:51:15] <serdem> hey gus, woudl you check this code please http://jsfiddle.net/tE4zy/1/ i can multi select and drag but cannot drop them :D
[04:51:20] <serdem> anybody have any idea?
[04:51:30] <seutje> js> print({} == {});
[04:51:32] <b-ot> seutje: false
[04:51:36] <dblosevn> I know but, java has an Object.equals :-)
[04:51:39] <seutje> was targetting the wrong bot
[04:51:53] <seutje> well, this ain't java
[04:52:31] <seutje> tbh, might be more interesting to keep a "changed" state and set it to true once something changed
[04:52:35] <dblosevn> I know, I was just tryin to wake back up :-) and seeing if maybe jquery had implemented this
[04:53:01] <dblosevn> I have a dirty state, but im unclear on the event firing order
[04:53:07] <alexises> hi$
[04:53:17] <seutje> why would it matter?
[04:53:45] <dblosevn> well, if i bind a change event to all my fields, and i click on a button is changefired before click?
[04:54:05] <dblosevn> assuming i changed a field, and clicked directly on the button
[04:54:05] <seutje> change doesn't fire when clicking a button
[04:54:16] <seutje> ofc the change would fire first
[04:54:36] <seutje> granted, on oldie the change wouldn't fire till blur fired on the changed element, but that would still fire before the submit of the form
[04:54:44] <dblosevn> being change doesnt fire until blur
[04:55:03] <seutje> also, please don't target click on the button, but submit on the form
[04:55:21] <seutje> clicking the button is only 1 of 17 million ways to submit a form :P
[04:55:25] <dblosevn> I usually do that, this is a special case
[04:55:48] <Cork> kostodo: sorry, can't really help you, as i haven't ever tried to solve the problem your struggling with
[04:55:50] <alexises> I'm a realy bad man in jquery
[04:55:51] <alexises> http://pastebin.com/M823kEQM
[04:56:04] <alexises> this pice of code don't work
[04:56:11] <seutje> gets a bit awkward when ur trying to determine which button was used to trigger the submit :P
[04:56:11] <Cork> kostodo: well at least not without labbing with your code (and i don't have the time for that when i'm at work :D )
[04:56:15] <alexises> i would like to confirm before submit a form :(
[04:56:17] <kostodo> Cork: I know I just felt like moaning!
[04:56:28] <kostodo> Cooooorrrrrrkkkkkk
[04:56:33] <alexises> i have a form with the good jsconfirm class
[04:56:42] <Cork> O_o'
[04:56:58] <alexises> and no error with firebug
[04:56:59] <Cork> then moan something else please...
[04:57:04] <dblosevn> im trying to maintain consistency accross multiple panels in a pure ajax controlpanel, and not all of the panels even have forms but a lot of them have save buttons
[04:57:45] <seutje> like multiple buttons in a single form?
[04:57:58] <dblosevn> no just one button ever
[04:58:04] <dblosevn> but some panels dont have forms
[04:58:30] <seutje> now I don't really get the problem
[04:59:04] <dblosevn> its not a problem, i just dont want to bind to submit on one panel and click on another
[04:59:21] <dblosevn> so i chose to always bind to click
[04:59:24] <Cork> dblosevn: why don't you just always have a form?
[04:59:26] <seutje> oh, those non-forms still have a button?
[04:59:30] <dblosevn> ya
[04:59:36] <seutje> here's to hoping nobody ever hits return
[04:59:43] <dblosevn> if theres no fields not much need for a form lol
[04:59:51] <dblosevn> theres never really anywhere they can
[05:00:05] <seutje> I always feel awkward about buttons that don't reside within a form
[05:00:06] <Cork> dblosevn: but its a simple way to make the code consistent
[05:00:35] <Cork> and not to forget it works without js
[05:00:36] <dblosevn> eg... my panels consisting only of an extgrid, there is technically no form fields
[05:00:39] <seutje> just <form><input type="submit" /></form> is fine
[05:00:51] <seutje> use that for comfirmation forms
[05:00:53] <dblosevn> and enter will simply confirm your entry
[05:01:19] <dblosevn> while save will actually save the data out
[05:02:38] <seutje> so just slap an attr on the form when an input changes and check it when the button gets clicked?
[05:03:05] <dblosevn> im thinking i like the idea of just comparing the serialized string
[05:03:07] <alexises> :'(
[05:03:19] <dblosevn> being they might have changed something and changed it back
[05:03:28] <seutje> true
[05:03:48] <seutje> order should remain so it should work fine for your use-case
[05:06:30] <dblosevn> isDirty: function () { return ($('#product-form').serialize() == this.originalData) ? true : false;	},
[05:06:39] <dblosevn> :-)
[05:11:06] <Cork> ah, your storing the params of it
[05:13:09] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/101
[05:14:51] <dblosevn> panelData is a global shared by multiple different modules in the cms
[05:15:40] <dblosevn> it can contain either a method to test if it isDirty or if the method doesnt exist it tests the dirty member
[05:17:19] <shamess> So I've got my serialized for data, but can I apply it back to the form?
[05:17:23] <shamess> *form
[05:19:26] <dblosevn> shamess: assuming you used serialzearray http://dblosevn.chosd.com/102
[05:19:47] <mazzachre> shamess: Change the serialized to an object, $.each through it and use $(':input[name:'+index+']').val(value);
[05:20:04] <shamess> ah, thanks guys.
[05:30:27] <Nebros> i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/qYprC/ what can i do now, if i will have changing collors between 2 colors? (white, grey, white...) all even grey, all odd white... ore something like that.
[05:44:54] <bau> hi all, I have this line of code:     menu2Val = $("option:selected", myEl).val() which (if I get it) returns the first word. how can I get the full word? (for example: "billy sam" and now just "billy")
[05:51:03] <shoky> bau: it gets the full value of the selected option
[05:52:23] <shoky> bau: if you want the text instead of the value, change .val() to .text()
[05:54:02] <bau> shoky, text seems to work, but then I have to make this control: if(menu2Val == 'something something') and it's not working with text, how can I do?
[05:54:30] <bau> get it, just use ""
[05:54:39] <alexises> i don't realy understend why this sheet of code don't work
[05:54:41] <alexises> http://pastebin.com/fE0jZ9Ku
[05:55:10] <bau> shoky, thanks again
[05:58:37] <shoky> alexises: because javascript inserts a semi-colon after the 'return'
[06:01:26] <alexises> shoky: you say that because I wrote my return expression on another line this santorome of javascript add a semi column when we never tell him to do ?
[06:02:12] <shoky> alexises: precisely
[06:03:01] <shoky> alexises: read about javascript's ASI (automatic semicolon insertion)
[06:09:30] <peterschmidler> I have two divs, one class="one" and one class="one two". How can I target only the one with class="one"?

[06:22:18] <andreime> hello! is there any change that in IE a $.post on line 1 is affected by a function on line two that deletes the cookies ?
[06:24:05] <jeffsmykil> $(selector)pluginName('destroy') won't invoke, the ini is working fine and i can call any method from within the plugin
[06:24:22] <jeffsmykil> $(selector).pluginName('destroy') rather
[06:27:19] <jacta> is it normal that jqueryMobile spawns popups from my page behind the header when browsing over phone, is that normal?
[06:28:24] <shoky> jeffsmykil got a fiddle?
[06:28:48] <jeffsmykil> i have a paste bin but id rather not share it with the entirety of the channel
[06:29:26] <jeffsmykil> I'm using this boilerplate shoky
[06:29:26] <jeffsmykil> http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[06:29:47] <jeffsmykil> its not letting ne call $('#elem').defaultPluginName('destroy')
[06:30:00] <jeffsmykil> maybe they are private and I'm not realizing it
[06:30:58] <shoky> uhmm and you have a destroy method?
[06:31:21] <shoky> er
[06:31:35] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[06:31:46] <jeffsmykil> making it this.destroy did not help
[06:32:14] <shoky> i dont think thats how you call methods with this boilerplate..
[06:33:23] <Iarfen> Hi
[06:33:29] <Iarfen> Which CDN should I use to load jQuery?
[06:33:39] <jeffsmykil> shaky like i said i can call them no problem from within the plugin
[06:33:49] <shoky> from within, sure..
[06:34:07] <shoky> jeffsmykil you can try..  var plugin = $('#elem').data('plugin_defaultPluginName');  plugin.destroy();
[06:34:46] <jeffsmykil> this seems like a bad boiler plate if i have to do that but ill try
[06:34:52] <hughaj> what are the benefits/downsides of attr vs prop vs data when using html5 data attributes, apart from prop being 5x faster
[06:36:44] <jeffsmykil> shoky plugn is undefined
[06:37:07] <shoky> jeffsmykil: this is pointless without a fiddle
[06:37:38] <jeffsmykil> agreed
[06:37:49] <jeffsmykil> shaky do you use a boilerplate or templatE?
[06:39:50] <shoky> mmm not really
[06:40:06] <Pallet> Hi all, I need to pass a form input value http://pastebin.com/jw8qW0eX but I'm not sure how, can someone help
[06:42:38] <shoky> jeffsmykil: take a look at  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[06:42:45] <jacta> is it normal that jqueryMobile spawns popups from my page behind the header when browsing over phone, is that normal? - on pc its correct, on pone is really sloooow(if even showup) and behind header :S
[06:42:48] <jeffsmykil> yeah I have
[06:45:42] <lyrae> how can i do something like $('#products-*').hide()
[06:46:59] <jrajav> lyrae: $('[id^=products-]').hide()
[06:47:06] <lyrae> doesnt work in ie7 though
[06:47:10] <jrajav> ^= means "this attribute starts with.."
[06:47:16] <jeffsmykil> well then give them a common class
[06:52:59] <hughaj> You could also use a custom pseudo selector to locate items by custom properties/complex properties
[07:00:07] <Pallet> anyone ?
[07:08:22] <hughaj> @Pallet pass Input c0ts1 you mean and to where? the link?
[07:08:29] <Pallet> yeh
[07:09:12] <Pallet> hughaj, <a href="http://www.domain.com/songbird/testfire.php?uid=<?php echo $currentuserid; ?>" data-lightbox="width:1000;height:600;">Send Test Tweet</a> is opening a lightbox
[07:09:53] <Pallet> but I also need to get the input value of the box that I'm editing
[07:11:03] <Pallet> hughaj, so I'm wondering about a javascript function, but I'm not sure how to fire the lightbox with that
[07:14:02] <daveace> how do i get the length of an array of objects (i just want the amount of objects)
[07:14:10] <daveace> myobj.length; seems to just die on me
[07:18:11] <hughaj> @pallet if it is on change on the input you could update the link there, or on click from the link pull it in from there, but I wouldn't actually use a link if it just a lightbox, saves messy event handling
[07:19:43] <hughaj> @daveace serialise your object and take a look at it, you might just be referencing the wrong part of the object
[07:20:30] <Pallet> how can I fire<a data-lightbox="width:1000;height:600;" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Lightbox</a> from a function ?
[07:22:01] <balr0g> please can somebody help to implement something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5013281/need-javascript-to-auto-scroll-to-the-target-html-element-after-page-loads but animated and smooth? and maybe some little delay...
[07:22:23] <hughaj> depends on the lightbox you are using, lightbox2 for example binds itself using rel

[07:33:36] <StephenS> how can I return false boolean?
[07:33:59] <delboy1978uk> return false; usually works for me...
[07:35:38] <delboy1978uk> in a .each() loop, we can refer to each thing as $(this) in the loop yes?
[07:35:46] <hughaj> @delboy yes, this is fine, but don't you want size() not count()
[07:36:14] <pachet> delboy1978uk: for your consideration:
[07:36:15] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/RXPrQ/
[07:37:18] <hughaj> @delboy1978uk count = $(this).children().size(); gives the same results as pachets fiddle
[07:38:35] <pachet> i prefer length
[07:38:41] <pachet> never really understood why .size was implemented
[07:38:51] <dcherman> hughaj: .size() is deprecated, use .length
[07:39:14] <hughaj> I missed that memo :P
[07:39:36] <delboy1978uk> size is deprecated? btw thanks pachet
[07:39:54] <hughaj> 1.8 onwards .length instead

[08:15:05] <black_warlock> hi
[08:15:17] <black_warlock> how to get the full querystring from url ?
[08:16:22] <Firebalrog> I am using jquery.validate plugin with a require email on a field but I also need to allow '@' for our employees to mark the customer as an opt-out of emails or no email address.
[08:16:27] <black_warlock> if i have pip.com/?dir=pipapipo&fisc=12  <<<< i would to pass the entire querystring to the code .... how to do it
[08:16:46] <Firebalrog> how can I add the '@' to be allowed on a 'require email' field
[08:17:57] <black_warlock> first of all you can set as type="email"
[08:18:20] <black_warlock> its new browser function that validate email
[08:18:43] <black_warlock> and on jq there are parameters like "required email"
[08:19:48] <black_warlock> Firebalrog set in the class="required email"
[08:21:43] <Firebalrog> yes I have required email and that works as expected. it only allows emails but I also need to allow '@' by itself. i.e.: || field='@'
[08:22:09] <NoiseEee> so you're looking for an email validator that doesnt validate email addresses is what you're saying
[08:22:11] <Firebalrog> I am considering forking jquery.validate.js
[08:22:22] <NoiseEee> just write a script to check for @ in the input then.
[08:22:28] <NoiseEee> JS email validation is balls anyways
[08:22:42] <Firebalrog> No I want it to validate email with a single exception of allowing an '@'
[08:23:23] <NoiseEee> imo "email validation" client side is waste of time
[08:23:24] <Firebalrog> field==valid email || field ==='@' is what I am trying to accomplish
[08:23:58] <Firebalrog> this is for an intranet site not for the web anyway.
[08:24:46] <Firebalrog> Our legacy code interprets '@' as an opt out or as the person doesn't have an email and doesn't want to be asked again.
[08:25:14] <Firebalrog> email==='' prompts employees to ask for email address
[08:25:56] <nFFF> NoiseEee, any idea how I would go about drawing a polygon shape around another shape on a transparent .png? I could draw to canvas and check for trasnparent pixels
[08:26:00] <black_warlock> javascript in general is freaking validation !
[08:26:02] <Firebalrog> health club with over 126000 workouts in a week means that our customers are in front of employees a lot.
[08:26:05] <jrajav> Firebalrog: That's.... odd....
[08:26:07] <nFFF> but actually decided on the poly-co-ords?
[08:26:11] <jrajav> Firebalrog: Why not just give them a nice button?
[08:26:20] <Firebalrog> I was leaning that way.
[08:26:20] <black_warlock> if ppl disallow js in the browser they can write anything
[08:26:40] <black_warlock> do it serverside !
[08:26:54] <Firebalrog> A button may be a good option.
[08:27:20] <Firebalrog> however the front desk staff get bonus money for collecting email addresses or @
[08:28:34] <Firebalrog> I think I will try a button in the same div. Cancel the validation event and then set the value and submit.
[08:31:32] <Nyalia> Is http://jsfiddle.net/ currently not really working?
[08:33:45] <delboy1978uk> no, i broke it
[08:39:02] <awc737> this isn't doing anything: $('#pagination li a').on('click', function(e){
[08:39:09] <awc737> although li a is a direct child
[08:39:19] <awc737> and '#pagination').on('click', etc works fine
[08:40:39] <awc737> the element is being created with jQuery append
[08:41:54] <jeffsmykil> shoky: I found a template I like better, ported my plugin, having a similar issue where $(element).plugin('destroy') is running init
[08:43:24] <shoky> jeffsmykil: you know by now that i cant help without fiddle/paste/whatever
[08:46:11] <GhaleonX> is this the correct channel for github help?
[08:46:35] <pachet> not unless it's related to github/jquery
[08:48:41] <awc737> is it safe to use $.self as a namespace?
[08:49:42] <EdwardIII> hrm is there an event on .dialog i can use to say "once the dialog box has finished loading, do this?"
[08:50:39] <jeffsmykil> EdwardIII: yes
[08:51:04] <EdwardIII> i can see there's an open event, but wasn't sure if that was the right thing?
[08:51:38] <jeffsmykil> are you looking for a callback?
[08:52:18] <EdwardIII> jeffsmykil: i am
[08:52:46] <jeffsmykil> If you don't mind me asking why do you need to wait for it to open? Its in the dom before its oppened
[08:54:56] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around?
[08:55:45] <dcherman> EdwardIII: see http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[08:57:21] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: how are you with plugins?
[08:57:53] <jeffsmykil> I have this basic structure: http://pastebin.com/Z7NfMsdB
[08:58:18] <jeffsmykil> when I call $("#element").myPlugin('destroy')  it goes to the init
[08:58:25] <EdwardIII> dcherman: ah good point, i just run .dialog({})... i should autohide, do what i want to the DOM, then .show() i guess
[09:00:09] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: well, in $.fn.myPlugin you're always creating a new "MyPlugin" and calling init, so yea
[09:03:39] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: well ill be
[09:07:57] <garciawebdev> is this line of code valid?? $(filter).data('object').actual_badge = $(filter).data('badge');
[09:08:47] <Firebalrog> seems to be
[09:09:18] <relipse> anyone with android? check out my brand new time tracking app -- https://cworklog.com/downloads/cworklog.latest.apk
[09:12:37] <garciawebdev> specially "...data('object').myproperty = myvalue"
[09:12:52] <garciawebdev> .data() is chainable in that way?
[09:12:53] <jacta> relipse, okay, ill look
[09:13:30] <relipse> jacta: cool thanks let me know what you think
[09:13:50] <jacta> almost down, testing on htc one x
[09:15:14] <dcherman> garciawebdev: if "object" is a pre-existing object, then sure.  otherwise, no.
[09:15:47] <garciawebdev> dcherman, thanks!
[09:16:09] <black_warlock> i have a link loading a page in particular div class, how can i let every link continues to open in that div ?
[09:16:44] <black_warlock> i have tried with $('.superlist a').click(function () {
[09:16:58] <jacta> relipse, cant stop the timer "stop" button dont work :p
[09:17:39] <black_warlock> but that function doesnt apply at new pages links
[09:17:50] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: upi jabe pme ,pre secpmd
[09:17:58] <jeffsmykil> you have one more second oops
[09:19:07] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: i'd just ask, i'm sure if i dont answer someone else here could
[09:19:21] <gotwig> dblosevn, jo
[09:19:29] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: I changed my init logic to that on the http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:19:35] <dblosevn> oj
[09:19:42] <jeffsmykil> page, but now it can't find any of the internal methods
[09:19:52] <relipse> jacta: you have to slide it over to the stop text
[09:19:57] <awc737> if I use 10 scripts, one different on each page, would you say its better to minify and load them all on each page? or load the different one on each page?
[09:20:01] <relipse> jacta: did you figure it out?
[09:20:17] <jacta> relipse, first when you said it, its not good that way :P
[09:20:36] <relipse> jacta: yeah i want to replace it with another one
[09:20:47] <jacta> atleast it seems to work :)
[09:20:52] <relipse> the idea is i dont want user to accidently stop time clock
[09:21:13] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: do you have an example gist or jsfiddle?
[09:21:34] <jomofcw> Can I use $radioElement.attr('checked',true); to check a radio input, please ?
[09:22:54] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: http://pastebin.com/yM0Tbcyn
[09:22:59] <jeffsmykil> it finds the init alright
[09:23:05] <jeffsmykil> but then it can't find any of the methods from init
[09:24:44] <jeffsmykil> like it no longer recognizes this
[09:25:08] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: "myPlugin" doesn't exist anywhere, you've never created it as far as i can see.
[09:25:45] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: i'd recommend you use JSHint/JSLint on your code, it would've caught that.
[09:25:52] <jeffsmykil> that should read MyPlugin
[09:27:32] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: it's still an error.  line 34 - "methods" is an object, not a function
[09:27:58] <dcherman> and your constructor is never invoked
[09:33:01] <jeffsmykil> isn't that what the $.fn.myPLugin does?
[09:33:53] <bodisjw> maybe this is a faq, but i'm having terrible (as in unusable) performance with jquery ui sortable.  i want to be able to drag and drop between different table cells
[09:34:03] <bodisjw> which i guess means O(n^2) on the connectWith
[09:34:16] <bodisjw> any advice? is this an anti-pattern?
[09:36:44] <jrajav> Is a blur event fired when a focused element is destroyed?
[09:36:59] <andrew9184> jrajav: no, shouldnt be, but how is it "destroyed"
[09:37:16] <jrajav> By setting the innerHTML of the containing element to ''
[09:37:24] <NoiseEee> jrajav: the element doesn't exist anymore so surely it cannot blur :)
[09:37:58] <jrajav> So I should call the same function when destroying it, too, then. Alright, thanks.
[09:38:08] <andrew9184> NoiseEee: sometimes that logic doesn't work with IE :)
[09:38:40] <Avinash> All: http://twitter.com/jquerybot (Hope someone will find it usefull) .. Thanks! :)
[09:39:12] <andrew9184> Avinash: do you own jquerybot?
[09:39:49] <jacta> how can I target an a with a specific href
[09:40:09] <jacta> like href is href="38" for this
[09:40:21] <jacta> tried: #navbar li a[href=38]
[09:41:41] <jeffsmykil> i think you can do attr("href"
[09:43:24] <jeffsmykil> or it may be prop
[09:43:27] <jacta> tried console.log( $(a[href="38"]) ); - no luck yet
[09:43:27] <jeffsmykil> one of the two should work
[09:45:22] <morfin> hello
[09:46:12] <morfin> i have one question: if i use $("#elem1,#elem2").plugin() will it create separate plugins or they'll have shared space?
[09:46:27] <morfin> i need to share data between separate elements
[09:49:23] <garciawebdev> morfin depends on plugin
[09:50:52] <gotwig> dblosevn, hey, whats the callback that I get, or how do I execute a javascript function after the thing is initialized? http://gridster.net/
[09:51:05] <gotwig> actually, when the grid is ready, the class name changes to "ready"
[09:51:24] <gotwig> but I think there is something like a callback option out there...
[09:53:02] <morfin> i want to call one event for multiple elements from event handler
[09:53:42] <morfin> so i want to have group of elements and as example if i trigger mouseover for one it triggers mouseover for every element
[09:55:12] <garciawebdev> morfin: if you're writing your own plugin, yes, you'll have those elements available and use them to fire a event
[09:56:35] <morfin> jquery will exclude duplicates as example if i do ("div","#mydiv") where #mydiv is div
[09:56:37] <morfin> ?
[09:56:54] <jeffsmykil> dcherman: i really don't understand I'm trying to do it the exact way the authoring page shows
[10:00:20] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: you've never used your constructor function, and the way you've implemented it, "this" in your init/destroy methods are going to be the "MyPlugin.methods" object, not an instance of your plugin
[10:00:32] <garciawebdev> morfin: yes
[10:01:14] <jeffsmykil> dcherman how can i fix this?
[10:03:08] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: i'm at work so i can't spend time re-writing it....i'd really suggest that you do some reading on javascript in general so that you understand what you're trying to do.  following guides if you're missing fundamentals doesn't always end well as you're finding out
[10:03:26] <jeffsmykil> fair enough
[10:03:33] <jeffsmykil> thank you for your help
[10:06:15] <dblosevn> gotwig: not seeing a callback right off the top of my head
[10:06:28] <gotwig> dblosevn, so there is nothing?
[10:06:43] <gotwig> dblosevn, I can do an event listener... when gridster is ready, it sets a class that is called so
[10:07:38] <dblosevn> no real way to watch for that though
[10:08:03] <gotwig> dblosevn, can I use onload?
[10:08:15] <dblosevn> and it looks like it adds the ready class before its ready
[10:09:48] <gotwig> dblosevn, my internet connection is too fast :(
[10:10:27] <gotwig> dblosevn, what ever, I can try with an event listener.. ?
[10:11:44] <gotwig> dblosevn, :>ﬂ
[10:11:47] <gotwig> oups..
[10:12:56] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/103
[10:13:06] <dblosevn> I added a config option ready
[10:13:10] <dblosevn> takes no args
[10:13:56] <dblosevn> .gridster({ready: function() { //dostuff}, moreoptions});
[10:15:04] <gotwig> dblosevn, lol
[10:15:34] <dblosevn> if the wheels broke fix it :-)
[10:15:54] <gotwig> dblosevn, right. if its ready, it is true?
[10:16:14] <dblosevn> ready is fired after the plugin is completly initialized
[10:16:26] <gotwig> dblosevn, does it even work ;D?
[10:16:32] <dblosevn> no clue
[10:16:34] <dblosevn> try it out
[10:16:35] <gotwig> ....
[10:16:40] <dblosevn> should work just fine
[10:16:40] <gotwig> thx
[10:17:12] <dblosevn> or not lol i dont care i didnt even have to do that :-P

[10:41:55] <gotwig> dblosevn, lol
[10:42:10] <dblosevn> because im not getting why its not working
[10:42:17] <jacta> :\
[10:42:18] <gotwig> dblosevn, when you go here
[10:42:22] <gotwig> http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[10:42:25] <gotwig> and you go into console
[10:42:35] <gotwig> tell me what you have to do, to stop that b¬πt¬¢ƒß...
[10:42:51] <dblosevn> close the browser?
[10:43:18] <gotwig> stop the thing
[10:43:21] <gotwig> ...
[10:43:30] <gotwig> ‚ô•
[10:44:11] <dblosevn> var spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(target); remove var
[10:44:34] <gotwig> opts is not defined...
[10:44:40] <gotwig> and well, I dont want to make a new thing
[10:44:47] <dblosevn> dude
[10:44:49] <gotwig> just grab the current running, then stop
[10:45:01] <dblosevn> just remove var from the beginning of that line please
[10:45:07] <dblosevn> spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(target);
[10:45:14] <gotwig> yeah
[10:45:24] <dblosevn> you didnt do it
[10:45:33] <gotwig> i didnt xD
[10:45:38] <gotwig> there is not such a line, lol
[10:45:40] <dblosevn> line 128
[10:46:08] <gotwig> where
[10:46:16] <dblosevn> view-source:http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[10:46:19] <dblosevn> 128
[10:47:11] <gotwig> ah...
[10:47:13] <gotwig> and why remove it?
[10:47:22] <dblosevn> so its not scoped to the ready
[10:47:53] <morfin> hmm
[10:48:22] <dblosevn> either do that or move your gridster config inside the ready
[10:48:26] <jita> 	 I have a page with a checkboxes, and for one checkbox is marked as checked. When I view the source code of the page, it says <checked='checked'> while if i use query selector $('#checked_checkbox').attr('checked') it says undefined. Its really weird as the styles are not getting applied.
[10:49:15] <dblosevn> its still there
[10:49:16] <gotwig> dblosevn, and now your old command?
[10:49:23] <gotwig> I added the code...
[10:49:30] <dblosevn> nothing to add
[10:49:39] <dblosevn> remove var from that line
[10:49:43] <dblosevn> leave the rest in tact
[10:50:00] <dblosevn> change var spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(target); to spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(target);
[10:50:10] <gotwig> what ever...
[10:50:15] <gotwig> I put it into the ready I guess
[10:50:19] <gotwig> eh not there..
[10:50:22] <gotwig> just inside the gridster thing
[10:50:59] <morfin> how can i execute code after binded event
[10:51:05] <gotwig> dblosevn, I made the change ...
[10:51:09] <morfin> i think i should bind own handler
[10:51:21] <morfin> after all another handlers
[10:51:33] <dblosevn> wow you have got to be retarded add var back
[10:51:42] <dblosevn> you removed it from the wrong line
[10:51:51] <gotwig> wtf.
[10:51:57] <gotwig> yeah
[10:52:10] <jacta> hrhr
[10:52:51] <gotwig> got it
[10:53:59] <dblosevn> just put the var back and do this ,ready: function() {spinner.stop();}}).data('gridster');
[10:55:06] <motaka2> hello I am using tinymce - I have save my content in ajax - but I can capture ctl+s when the focus is out of textarea , but when the focus in the textarea, nothing happes - what should I do?
[10:55:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/108
[10:57:45] <gotwig> dblosevn, nope...
[10:58:50] <dblosevn> well seeing as how you didnt do it id guess it wouldnt work
[10:59:11] <maxmoore14> can someone talk to me about page security for a minute?
[10:59:21] <maxmoore14> I am used to developing in .NET
[10:59:41] <maxmoore14> so I'm using forms auth and peristent session state on the server
[11:00:16] <maxmoore14> but I'm developing an app with jquery mobile and using .htm files instead of .aspx
[11:00:41] <gotwig> spinner is not defined, dude
[11:00:50] <gotwig> ready: function() {spinner.stop().data('gridster')},
[11:00:59] <dblosevn> your not doing what i told you to do
[11:01:03] <dblosevn> im done
[11:01:25] <dblosevn> i gave you the code block to paste
[11:01:35] <gotwig> that part does not work
[11:01:37] <maxmoore14> I was thinking I would use $(document).one('pagebeforecreate', function(event){}) and do a quick ajax request to check the login status
[11:01:42] <gotwig> because two }, one {
[11:01:48] <dblosevn> spinner is defined where i told you to paste it
[11:01:53] <maxmoore14> then redirect the user to the correct page
[11:02:07] <maxmoore14> home if logged in, login if not
[11:02:09] <dblosevn> [13:55] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/108
[11:02:25] <dblosevn> goes around line 142
[11:02:29] <maxmoore14> but I think I am creating a race condition cause it seems to work sometimes and not others
[11:02:47] <NoiseEee> so what if i craft a response to send to your success handler, which logs me in regardless
[11:02:52] <gotwig> dblosevn, I did it like that
[11:03:01] <dblosevn> wait no it doesnt
[11:03:10] <motaka2> hello I am using tinymce - I have save my content in ajax - but I can capture ctl+s when the focus is out of textarea , but when the focus in the textarea, nothing happes - what should I do?
[11:03:11] <dblosevn> you still need to global spinner
[11:03:24] <dblosevn> anyways :-)
[11:03:25] <maxmoore14> what generally happens is, if the user is not logged in and tries to visit home.htm, they get redirected to login.htm and then immediatlely back to home.htm
[11:03:27] <gotwig> ah, wrong position I guess
[11:03:53] <maxmoore14> so I think home.htm is finishing its load routine and taking view
[11:04:23] <maxmoore14> perhaps I could stop the page lifecycle?
[11:06:20] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: was that question for me?
[11:06:46] <jim_j> hi all
[11:06:47] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: it was, yes.  i was just saying you need server-side authentication
[11:07:17] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: yes, I agree. I am using server-side auth for every data request
[11:08:00] <maxmoore14> the application is protected, the only thing I am trying to deal with is loading the correct static content for the user
[11:08:25] <jim_j> I have a dilemma with jquery's validate library.  can someone tell me how to make sure the hidden field is validated?  here is my example:  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/6/
[11:08:32] <maxmoore14> in the end, I don't really care if someone has access to the html
[11:08:50] <maxmoore14> just want to load the correct page, then make secure calls to the data
[11:09:09] <jim_j> I'm setting a hidden field to 'required' when at least one checkbox isn't checked
[11:09:19] <jim_j> but validate is ignoring it
[11:09:34] <maxmoore14> but I'm struggling with loading the correct page if someone bookmarks a page but is not logged in
[11:11:43] <motaka2> can anyone answer this question ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14965490/disabling-tinymce-ctrls-shortcut-to-enable-this-shortcut-for-ajax-content-save
[11:12:07] <Pallet> can someone help me with my syntax please $('#test-tweet-info').fadeIn('fast').delay(800).$('#lightbox-overlay').click();
[11:12:49] <scriptraptor> Hey guys, I have a conceptual query - if I have a modal popup that is appending HTML to my file it doesn't exist on the initial document ready. so, what is the best way to manage new scripts to fire therein? is it best to append a <script> inside the modal popup?
[11:13:42] <scriptraptor> Pallet: how is $('#lightbox-overlay) a method of $('#test-tweet-info')? chaining causes the object to return itself so what you did made no sense
[11:20:09] <roger21> hello
[11:20:28] <jacta> is there a way to focus the input field with hiting the "Tilf√∏j" button - http://jsbin.com/alapa/55/edit
[11:20:40] <roger21> i would like to greasmonkey an element that has been given a click event handler with jquery 1.7
[11:20:57] <roger21> so i just want to disable that click event
[11:21:08] <roger21> er click handler
[11:21:09] <saedelaere> if I have something like this <fmt:formatNumber value='${totalValue}'/> how can I change value with jQuery?
[11:21:50] <saedelaere> i tried with .attr('value,' 'foo') but that is not working
[11:22:04] <roger21> how can i do that ? (i have the element, i tried ro reassigne the click attribute so far, unsuccesefully)
[11:22:08] <saedelaere> or I did not properly select the fmt
[11:22:09] <roger21> it's an li
[11:23:06] <NoiseEee> saedelaere: i'd say the first step would be confirming you have the element you want
[11:23:24] <NoiseEee> saedelaere: but <fmt:formatNumber> in html??
[11:24:03] <saedelaere> NoiseEee: it is in a <span></span>
[11:24:10] <roger21> the click thingy is assigned with a "click" function in the code
[11:24:14] <dblosevn> hmm, having a crazy problem, im not coming up with an immediate solution to
[11:24:31] <roger21> but i guess i can't use it through my greasemonkey script
[11:24:56] <roger21> unless i use the unsafewindow maybe
[11:25:29] <dblosevn> I'm building a pretty complex admin panel that is only one page with a ton of ajax to make it work, the logic is all working great and its super fast :-)
[11:25:40] <andrew9184> is it single page ?
[11:25:58] <dblosevn> @ me?
[11:27:45] <Pallet>             $('#test-tweet-info').fadeIn('fast');
[11:27:45] <Pallet>             $('#lightbox-overlay').click();
[11:27:54] <Pallet> oops, sorry wrong window
[11:27:58] <dblosevn> Well, the problem I am having is a race condition is being created if you click one link and then change your mind and click another before the page finishes loading. The event handlers that were attached to the previous view still fire long after the new view is rendered and it ends up binding events from the first view to the second
[11:28:36] <Teduardo> if you use the data attribute on the ajax call how does that get sent to the server.. $_GET?
[11:28:37] <Pallet> how do I do a $('#test-tweet-info').fadeIn('fast'); then wait for a while, then do $('#lightbox-overlay').click();
[11:28:41] <Pal-JQ> Hi Hi ...i know it's very simple thing but i am not able to solve this problem can any please help me......i have string "GMT+0530" to convert "GTM+05:30"
[11:28:51] <Woet> Teduardo: read the doc
[11:29:03] <Teduardo> that was super useful
[11:29:40] <dblosevn> Teduardo: its your responsibility to inject your data params into your ajax post
[11:29:43] <hXm> i have this var index = $( "#selectable li" ).index(this); for get the index of a selectable <ol>, but how to get the id of the <li> selected? i used this var index = $( "#selectable li" ).index(this).attr('id'); and wont work
[11:30:04] <_andre> hello
[11:30:31] <_andre> does jquery keeps any sort of pool of pre-open HTTP connections to be used in $.ajax() calls?
[11:30:49] <dblosevn> _andre: why on earth would it do that
[11:31:16] <_andre> dblosevn: performance?
[11:31:40] <dblosevn> think mobile, an open connection burns bandwidth and battery same with laptops
[11:31:41] <_andre> i'm seeing a lot of HTTP connections to my webserver which are opened and then closed with no data sent
[11:32:04] <_andre> i'm wondering if jquery ajax could be the case
[11:32:16] <_andre> i'm not proposing this as a feature :)
[11:32:42] <dblosevn> most likely some of your ajax calls only post and dont expect a response and your not sending one :-)
[11:33:01] <roger21> i have a element that has been given an event handler with the click function, how i disable this handler
[11:33:15] <_andre> dblosevn: interesting, hadn't thought of POST
[11:33:44] <dblosevn> can you see the headers of the request in the logs?
[11:33:56] <dblosevn> if so look for x-requested-with
[11:34:06] <_andre> i can try a capture
[11:34:13] <Pallet> $('#lightbox-overlay').delay(3200).click(); doesn't seem to delay, what am I doinmg wrong?
[11:34:49] <dblosevn> _andre: X-Requested-With:XMLHttpRequest will be in the logs if it was requested via ajax
[11:35:18] <_andre> dblosevn: thanks for the help, i'll look into it
[11:35:24] <dblosevn> np
[11:35:32] <_andre> dblosevn: i'm just a network admin, but this customer is causing some problems :p
[11:35:37] <dblosevn> now about my race condition lol
[11:36:05] <roger21> how can i disable an event handler given by the click fuunction ?
[11:36:13] <dblosevn> im a developer/sysadmin/net admin/telco guy/av guy/whatever else they decide i am for the day :-)
[11:36:33] <dblosevn> roger21: that makes no since click is a handler
[11:36:46] <roger21> +sense :p
[11:36:51] <dblosevn> w/e
[11:37:37] <roger21> dblosevn, i mean, i have an element, he has been given an handler, i want to disable the click event
[11:38:06] <roger21> what would be the jquery method to dio that?
[11:38:16] <dblosevn> $('elselector').off('click');
[11:38:31] <jacta> dblosevn, :p
[11:38:44] <dblosevn> I think thats jquery 1.9+
[11:38:56] <dblosevn> ?jquery.off
[11:38:57] <roger21> off  \o/ here we go, thanks
[11:39:10] <roger21> aww
[11:39:20] <roger21> no it's 1.7
[11:39:26] <dblosevn> ya 1.7
[11:39:32] <dblosevn> unbind before that
[11:40:10] <roger21> wut?
[11:40:18] <roger21> how?
[11:40:20] <roger21> why?
[11:40:29] <roger21> doesn' off do all the work?
[11:40:32] <dblosevn> before 1.7 $('elselector').unbind('click');
[11:40:39] <roger21> oh ok

[11:51:40] <jacta> is there a way to focus the input field with hiting the "Tilf√∏j" button - http://jsbin.com/alapa/55/edit
[11:54:12] <_andre> dblosevn: thinking more about it, i don't think POST is the issue, because then at least i'd have the HTTP headers
[11:54:33] <_andre> what i'm seeing is connections being closed without any sort of data being sent, not even headers
[11:54:50] <dblosevn> apache panicking?
[11:55:09] <dblosevn> or CORS requests?
[11:55:44] <dblosevn> CORS only makes a HEAD request and gets no data back only a header
[11:57:28] <dblosevn> I dont think headers are counted in the data payload
[11:58:46] <_andre> i'm not just looking at the data length, we have an apache module and a daemon which track this kind of connection info
[11:58:47] <vacho> after upgrading to latest jquery I am getting: TypeError: $(...).live is not a function
[11:59:23] <dblosevn> ok wtf
[11:59:36] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ vacho
[12:00:14] <dblosevn> if i do $('#ajax-content').html(ret.html).data('module', module); it sets the data for the element
[12:01:07] <dblosevn> but if I try to do a selector such as $('#ajax-content[data-module="apps|feat|3"]').length I get nohing back but the data is there on the element
[12:01:42] <dblosevn> however if i do $('#ajax-content').html(ret.html).attr('data-module', module); its both an attr and a member of data
[12:03:55] <dblosevn> I dont get it

[12:10:18] <Che-Anarc> Is there any way I can use "this" eg: this.content  to identify m object / element?
[12:11:33] <Che-Anarc> I am basically looking for the ID of the this element which invoked function

[12:14:19] <NoiseEee> Che-Anarc: well depends on your code.  something like  $('#container').on('click',function(e) { // e.target is what was clicked })
[12:16:34] <Che-Anarc> NoiseEee> What if I am not passing e to the funtion?  to be honest I am trying to adjust some1's widget code they have a general positioning function: this.content.css( {'top': ......   I would like to go know if i can use this to get the instance of this so that certian layers are not centred.

[12:38:22] <jim_j> hey all
[12:55:36] <jim_j> help on hidden field required validation anyone?  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/6/
[12:56:13] <jacobroufa> why cant i access my mapdata variable outside of my getJSON() call? http://pastebin.com/U5zeLEq9
[12:58:23] <Woet> http://jsfiddle.net/DQjcW/ - why does this alert even when you click 'cancel'?
[12:59:06] <Woet> hm, it should be != null
[12:59:14] <Woet> I swear I tried that before but it works now
[12:59:56] <dblosevn> jacobroufa: because your trying to use mapdata before the request completes
[13:01:08] <jacobroufa> dblosevn: what can i do then to have that call execute in the order its written? i need to act on the data im pulling from getJSON...
[13:01:20] <dblosevn> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/DQjcW/1/
[13:02:40] <dblosevn> jacobroufa: .getJSON is an asyncrnous call, you will have to do what needs to be done with mapdata within the callback.
[13:03:05] <jacobroufa> ahhhhhh
[13:03:06] <jacobroufa> duh
[13:03:17] <dblosevn> after the callback completes, you can use mapdata outside of the callback
[13:14:49] <jim_j> is this correct?  $("#commentForm").validate().settings.ignore = "";
[13:17:35] <mowol> my element has id="something:somethingelse", i cannot reach this element using jquery because of the :, do i need to do something special here?
[13:19:04] <thujone> why would you use a colon, that's illegal html
[13:19:29] <thujone> use a hyphen or underscore
[13:20:29] <thujone> i doubt there's any workaround for a colon
[13:26:04] <jim_j> I'm pretty close to getting the hidden field validator, have to use 'ignore: ""' I guess
[13:27:24] <robinson_k> hi
[13:28:49] <robinson_k> when i call .trigger('remove.myPluginNameSpace') in 1.8.2 the element is removed in Chrome 24.
[13:28:57] <mowol> i used the input[id$="somethingelse"] instead.. that will work
[13:29:37] <robinson_k> Chrome 24 has a native remove method on it's elements added. but why it is called when triggering the event?
[13:30:37] <braddunbar> Anyone know of a simple polyfill for `checkValidity` and friends?
[13:30:51] <robinson_k> a found it! https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.8-stable/src/event.js#L347
[13:31:05] <robinson_k> jquery calls it.
[13:34:54] <Iskaral> I'm having some trouble with something if anyone has a moment to help.
[13:34:56] <Iskaral> http://pastebin.com/fhdTkenm
[13:35:18] <Iskaral> #live_transaction_filter is a select box
[13:35:25] <Drager> Do you guys know a nice slide plugin?
[13:35:28] <Iskaral> #submit is the submit button
[13:35:32] <amph1bius> Drager: iscroll
[13:35:49] <amph1bius> Iskaral
[13:35:51] <amph1bius> what is the problem
[13:36:19] <Iskaral> I need it to submit the form. Whenever a new option is selected from the drop down
[13:36:23] <jrockjiggz> Iskaral: please do not use the enter key for punctuation
[13:36:31] <amph1bius> that's not a very descriptive example, please jsfiddle or jsbin a working example
[13:36:48] <amph1bius> or not working for that matter.
[13:37:07] <Drager> amph1bius: ?
[13:37:16] <amph1bius> iscroll is a nice slide plugin
[13:37:18] <robinson_k> sorry for the dumb question, but why is jquery calling the event?
[13:37:20] <Drager> amph1bius: I meant like a image slide
[13:37:57] <jrockjiggz> Iskaral: http://pastebin.com/WQSc5FrR
[13:43:11] <amph1bius> Iskaral: without the html, i can't give you any clues.  USE JSFIDDLE
[13:46:46] <mowol> is it possible to have a selector like name has to start with X and end with Y ?
[13:48:15] <Mage_Dude> mowol: Do you have a weird/random list of id's or something that match that pattern?
[13:48:34] <mowol> Mage i cant use : in selectors, so i have to use before:after
[13:48:59] <mowol> but input[id^="before"][id$="after"] should do it i think
[13:49:24] <mowol> works in fiddle atleast
[13:49:46] <Mage_Dude> Anyone use ColVis for DataTables?
[13:54:41] <guyz> could someone help me understand a bug on this example? http://jsfiddle.net/drpKm/  I have a blank document with that code, except on clicking it will "scroll up" elements which were previously hidden. (so clicking any panel, expands them all instantly, then rolls them up, leaving only the clicked one open)
[13:55:07] <dblosevn> anybody see anything wrong with this selector?
[13:55:09] <dblosevn> $('#ajax-content[data-module="apps|lit|3"] #product-feat')
[13:55:10] <raj> any way to make jsbin show line numbers
[13:55:11] <raj> ?
[13:55:41] <dblosevn> $('#ajax-content[data-module="apps|lit|3"]) returns a div, and $('#product-feat') returns a div
[13:56:01] <dblosevn> and $('#product-feat') is a child of $('#ajax-content[data-module="apps|lit|3"]')
[13:56:26] <mowol> dblosevn id's have to be unique, so just use #product-feat alone?
[13:57:06] <dblosevn> I know im trying to namespace #ajax-content with the data-module the id wont ever be on the page more then once
[13:58:09] <dblosevn> but im running into a race condtion, if you click one tree node, and dont wait for it to finish loading before clicking another the first nodes events will be bound on top of the second node you clicked's events
[13:58:13] <jrockjiggz> $('#ajax-content').filter( function(){ return $(this).data(module') == 'apps|lit|3'); }); //mayube
[13:59:16] <Iarfen> Hi
[13:59:20] <dblosevn> im hoping doing this will caouse the stale events to fail to find a target to bind to and go away :-)
[13:59:32] <Iarfen> this jquery cdn works on firefox but not on chrome? www.games4ever.org, help please!
[14:00:09] <jrockjiggz> Iarfen: not possible
[14:00:26] <Iarfen> jrockjiggz: see the website by yourself, this is what is happening
[14:00:36] <jrockjiggz> what is?
[14:01:18] <Drager> Do you guys know a nice slide plugin for whole divs that contain divs with image and text?
[14:01:47] <Iarfen> jrockjiggz: I'm trying to use google cdn, but it doesn't work good on chrome or IE
[14:02:33] <dblosevn> any other ideas on how i can handle this race condition
[14:03:35] <Iarfen> Drager: jFlow maybe?
[14:09:52] <Drager> Iarfen: hm
[14:10:12] <didiergm1> but I have difficulties evaluating if JQM can be a single solution between desktop & tablets. Opinions or pointer to blog entries welcomed
[14:10:15] <Iarfen> Drager: it works? (I solved my problem, chrome doesn't accept to load external scripts without https xD)
[14:10:52] <Iarfen> Drager: if this slider isn't good for you, I think the best to do is to program your own, it's not hard. Just a settimeout() or setinterval() function :D
[14:17:19] <Drager> Iarfen: Yeah I tried to build my own .http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/
[14:17:40] <Iarfen> Drager: what's the problem now?
[14:18:29] <Drager> Iarfen: Well, the first "slide" should be hidden when pressing "Next" and the other one should appear.
[14:18:32] <Iarfen> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/1/
[14:18:34] <Drager> Cannot get it to work out
[14:20:44] <Drager> Thing was that I first tried to make that (the jsfiddle link) but couldn't get it to work out so good as you can see, so after that I started to look after one online.
[14:21:19] <Iarfen> Drager: here http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/2/
[14:21:44] <Iarfen> it works for infinite divs ;)
[14:21:51] <Iarfen> Drager: you can use jFlow too
[14:24:00] <Drager> Iarfen: Doesn't work for me
[14:24:29] <Iarfen> Drager: damn, analyze the code and see what's wrong, maybe with the selection of divs
[14:24:40] <Iarfen> Drager: try a little, then you learn :D
[14:24:57] <overburn> hey guys, i have a small question
[14:25:02] <Drager> Iarfen: Yeah, checking right now :)
[14:25:09] <overburn> is there anyway to make the jquery ui autocomplete pop up instead of down?
[14:25:35] <Drager> Iarfen: Haha yeah, it was just a unclosed string.
[14:26:13] <zDog> anyone have a real world example of colorbox with ajax?
[14:26:13] <Iarfen> Drager: xD ok
[14:26:25] <Iarfen> Drager: ahora funciona? :D
[14:26:47] <zDog> I'm ajaxing 3 elements into colorbox and need it to update
[14:26:54] <hdon> hi all :) jquery-ui issue: i have dialog Foo whose .ui-dialog-content element has a vertical scrollbar. when i click any other dialog, dialog Foo scrolls to the top. can anyone tell me how to suppress this behavior?
[14:27:21] <Drager> Iarfen: haha, what now?
[14:28:02] <Iarfen> Drager: now we have to do that it works automatically
[14:28:19] <Iarfen> Drager: give me the latest version
[14:29:00] <Drager> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/3/
[14:30:46] <Iskaral> Anyone know of any good marquee plugins?
[14:31:32] <Iarfen> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/4/
[14:31:42] <Iarfen> Iskaral: what's marquee plugins?
[14:36:02] <Drager> Iarfen: Hm, yeah that only runs it auto once?
[14:36:18] <Iarfen> Drager: I think it don't runs here
[14:36:30] <Iarfen> Drager: you have to place it on a real website,
[14:36:54] <Drager> Iarfen: Yeah I did
[14:37:10] <Iarfen> Drager: it works? (I haven't tried it)
[14:37:51] <Drager> Iarfen: It changes to the second one then stops
[14:37:56] <Drager> I have three
[14:38:47] <Iarfen> Drager: it works right?
[14:39:29] <Rejected> I'm a newbie having trouble with basic jQuery, here's the code I'm using -> http://jsfiddle.net/fWzzx/7/ . Now, what I'd like it to do is replace the row cells with editboxes when 'Edit' is clicked, which it does for the first row but not for the second row.. thanks
[14:40:22] <Drager> Iarfen: As I said, it changes auto from the first to the second but not from the second to the third.
[14:40:25] <hdon> hmm, apparently jquery ui does not have this behavior on its own... some of my code must be doing it
[14:41:16] <Iarfen> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/5/ now?
[14:43:13] <Drager> Iarfen: Same thing
[14:45:00] <Iarfen> Drager: not sure what's the problem, sure it doesn't work? I see the code and it should be fine
[14:45:02] <genmud> hoping someone has ran into this pattern before, apologies in advance... I am not a web developer :)
[14:45:23] <genmud> I am looking to add a css attribute and then dynamically create a hyperlink off those attributes
[14:46:26] <Iarfen> genmud: simple, use addClass() and then $('.class_name') to create the hyperlink
[14:47:13] <Drager> hdon: http://jsfiddle.net/fWzzx/8/
[14:47:32] <Drager> hdon: You cannot have two of the same id at the same page. So use classes instead.
[14:47:45] <hdon> Drager, did you mean someone else?
[14:47:57] <Drager> Iarfen: Yeah I'm sure. Checked it a bunch of times
[14:48:00] <genmud> awesome, i think that should work :)
[14:48:04] <Drager> hdon: Oh sorry was meant for Rejected
[14:48:10] <hdon> np :)
[14:48:10] <Drager> Rejected:  http://jsfiddle.net/fWzzx/8/
[14:48:11] <oreth> what's the best way to do an "or" in a selector
[14:48:17] <Drager> Rejected: You cannot have two of the same id at the same page. So use classes instead.
[14:48:24] <oreth> like $("hr or a")
[14:48:36] <hdon> oreth, a comma will allow you to select multiple selectors
[14:48:42] <oreth> thank you
[14:48:46] <hdon> oreth, but it's not exclusive, it's inclusive
[14:49:05] <hdon> oreth, so if you do $('#a, #b') you will get both #a and #b if they both exist
[14:49:14] <oreth> yeah‚Ä¶ that's what I want :D
[14:50:00] <Rejected> Drager ok, tks
[14:50:07] <oreth> out of morbid academic curiosity: can you do a XOR with selectors?
[14:50:54] <Drager> Rejected: np
[14:53:57] <scriptraptor> i'm looking into event delegation but i can't really find a satisfying answer. i want to apply an event listener to dynamic content, so is there a way to listen for if a certain #id appears in the document?
[14:54:37] <scriptraptor> ideally i would rather $('.foo').click(function(){}); would work for the dynamic content

[14:55:01] <jim_j> I figured out how to use validator to require at least one checked checkbox
[14:55:32] <thang> sure scriptraptor, you could add an event listener for when the DOM changes and look for that #id so you can bind whatever you want to it.
[14:55:58] <thang> thats not optimal though, if a lot of content is added/removed from the page
[14:56:01] <scriptraptor> thang: would that be considered wasteful? i guess a 2 step function could work
[14:56:17] <scriptraptor> the other idea i was considering was just appending <script> in the dynamic
[14:57:49] <Drager> Iarfen: I jshinted the code
[14:58:03] <Iarfen> Drager: how I update?
[14:58:11] <scriptraptor> $('#foo').change(function() { if ($foo = $('.class')) { $foo.click(function(){ /* do something */}) });
[14:58:13] <thang> scriptraptor: when is the dynamic content loaded exactly?
[14:58:33] <Drager> Iarfen: What do you mean?
[14:58:34] <scriptraptor> when i click certain buttons a modal popup window is inserted
[14:58:44] <Iarfen> Drager: how I update the jshint to get your version
[14:59:44] <Drager> Iarfen: I'm sorry but I don't  get what you mean
[15:00:10] <scriptraptor> thang: i am aiming to get a click handler to work on the modal content
[15:00:32] <hdon> ahhhhh!
[15:00:45] <scriptraptor> it works if i add <script> within the modal, but i could do it cleaner i'm sure
[15:00:45] <hdon> jquery-ui 1.9.2 does NOT exhibit this annoying behavior, but 1.10.1 does!
[15:01:48] <thang> scriptraptor: yeah if you have control over when the content is added, you can add a callback to attach your handler as well.
[15:02:03] <scriptraptor> hm
[15:02:15] <Iarfen> Drager: on jsfiddle how I update? You make changes to the code how I see them without asking you the new url all the times?
[15:02:15] <thang> tinker around a bit
[15:02:49] <Drager> Iarfen: Ah okey. Just type a number and see if there's a new one I guess. Like /6
[15:03:07] <Iarfen> Drager: there's a button? I was searching it but don't see xD
[15:03:13] <Iarfen> Drager: jsfiddle needs a button for that xD!
[15:03:37] <zeroXten> hi. I'm trying to get "MarkItUp" working in a rails app. Getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method markItUp" - any hints? I'm guessing something hasn't loaded correctly, but I can see the markitup js in the sources.
[15:04:06] <Drager> Iarfen: Indeed it does. I'm gonna request a history function right now
[15:07:27] <Drager> and a future
[15:07:36] <Drager> Iarfen: Hm, so we're getting nowhere..
[15:08:10] <Iarfen> Drager: so what's the latest version? It doesn't work already?
[15:08:27] <scriptraptor> thang:  i'm gonna work on this idea
[15:08:36] <scriptraptor> time for me to go home now though, nn all
[15:08:55] <Drager> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/5/
[15:09:17] <Iarfen> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/6/
[15:09:20] <Iarfen> Drager: now?
[15:09:37] <__machine> can i execute some JS when a particular element is fully loaded / available? e.g. i have some content which has divs overlaid on each side with a gradient to fade the content away... but when the page loads, the fully content shows first then the fades appear and it looks weird... i want to make sure the fades are loaded before the content appears?
[15:12:15] <Drager> Iarfen: Nope
[15:14:18] <Drager> Iarfen: It has to be something with the max value
[15:14:35] <Iarfen> Drager: I know, but don't understand what
[15:15:34] <Iarfen> http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/7
[15:15:37] <Iarfen> Drager: now it works
[15:15:41] <Iarfen> Drager: at least for me
[15:18:06] <coldhead> great work everyone
[15:18:23] <kam187-rMBP> hey guys
[15:18:48] <kam187-rMBP> i have the standard big lag problem moving between pages on jq mobile
[15:19:00] <kam187-rMBP> so i've done all the usual, fast click, binded to the page events etc
[15:19:16] <kam187-rMBP> it's basically down to a slow device and too much complex data in my page
[15:19:18] <Drager> Iarfen: Not for me. o,0
[15:19:55] <kam187-rMBP> right now when i click from page A to B i notice a long delay, i assume jqm starts to load B, enhance it, and then kick off the transition to B
[15:20:19] <kam187-rMBP> (this is a milti page document)
[15:20:42] <kam187-rMBP> what i'd prefer to do is transition out A, load and enhance B, transition in B
[15:20:53] <kam187-rMBP> i don't mind the user starring at my page background in the mean time
[15:22:45] <Iarfen> Drager: when I click next it loads the three divs, I don't know what happens to you, I can't do anything
[15:23:00] <Drager> Iarfen: Yes, that works for me
[15:23:01] <Iarfen> Drager: do you see the 7 update?
[15:23:04] <Iarfen> Drager: ok good
[15:23:10] <Iarfen> Drager: so it's working :D
[15:23:22] <Drager> Iarfen: Yes of course. But not the auto thing
[15:23:34] <Drager> It goes from 1 to 2 but not from 2 to 3
[15:23:37] <Iarfen> Drager: the auto thing loads the same function, It has to work identical
[15:24:34] <Iarfen> Drager: put console.log($number) before and after the if clause on the auto function an analyze the values
[15:24:45] <Iarfen> Drager: I think there has to be the problem
[15:26:09] <Drager> Iarfen: Both says 1
[15:26:25] <Iarfen> Drager: but analyze it on each run
[15:26:33] <Iarfen> Drager: the function runs all times
[15:27:14] <Drager> Iarfen: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0
[15:27:33] <Iarfen> and what values it gives when clicking next?
[15:28:15] <Drager> Iarfen: Those values, because I just get 1, 1 on auto. It only runs once.
[15:28:55] <Iarfen> Drager: you only get 1,1 with the autoload?
[15:29:29] <Iarfen> Drager: it runs only once? then it's the autoload mechanism what's wrong
[15:29:56] <Drager> Iarfen: Yes
[15:30:11] <Iarfen> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/8/
[15:30:21] <Iarfen> Drager: now it has to work, it was a little error xD
[15:31:21] <Windows7_8> I want a way to slide content in JS within a container
[15:31:31] <Drager> Iarfen: Haha aw
[15:31:48] <Windows7_8> So... if I have a div, I want them to switch content one in a while, but with a nice slide transition.. any suggestions?
[15:31:54] <Drager> Iarfen: Now it displays the right content
[15:31:58] <Drager> number*
[15:33:45] <Drager> Iarfen: Thanks for the help!
[15:34:02] <Drager> Now I just need to find a way to slide it nicely
[15:34:13] <Windows7_8> :((
[15:34:20] <coldhead> Windows7_8: here are 80 plugins you might like to considerhttp://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/12/jquery-slider.html
[15:34:40] <coldhead> ya big baby
[15:35:36] <Iarfen> Drager: :D
[15:35:46] <Windows7_8> coldhead: A b aby :(
[15:37:59] <coldhead> a beautiful darling baby
[15:38:03] <Windows7_8> coldhead: kiss
[15:39:16] <Windows7_8> Is it acceptable to have divs in LI?
[15:40:16] <Drager> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/10/ :D
[15:42:29] <coldhead> Windows7_8: it sure is
[15:46:56] <glaksmono> anyone had seen a problem on IE9 when mouse hovering, the content rendering is changed on the page?
[15:47:29] <SDr> hi guys,
[15:48:23] <SDr> while trying to playback an mp4 file using flowplayer, I'm getting the error message "Undefined: Unsupported video"; flash is installed on IE (according to http://www.featureblend.com/javascript-flash-detection-library.html ), in what ways might we fix this?
[15:48:37] <coldhead> "we"?
[15:49:27] <SDr> coldhead, I'm taking suggestions on any way forward, because you guys are awesome in augmenting my cognition; hence I can't claim all the credit?
[15:49:34] <coldhead> SDr: can you get mp4 files to play in IE on the flowplayer demo site?
[15:49:45] <coldhead> hahahaha "augmenting my cognition" <3
[15:53:25] <SDr> huh, using IE10 to access http://flowplayer.org/standalone/skins/functional.html   yields "SCRIPT16385: Not implemented
[15:53:31] <SDr>  jquery.min.js, line 3 character 21035 "
[15:54:31] <coldhead> ew
[15:55:00] <coldhead> they upgraded to jquery 1.9.1 prematurely it seems
[15:55:33] <coldhead> the new jquery has broken a lot of the internet <3
[15:56:36] <hdon> hi all :) if i use something like $(document).on('click', 'selector'... how can i trigger the event?
[15:56:42] <SDr> okay, IE8 compatibility mode plays back the videos at my site
[15:56:52] <SDr> hdon, $("#selector").click() IIRC
[15:57:01] <hdon> SDr, that did not work :(
[15:57:06] <hdon> i will make a fiddle...
[15:59:23] <hdon> SDr, hmm, in jsfiddle it worked. i must have done something wrong.
[15:59:25] <hdon> thanks SDr
[16:00:17] <hdon> SDr, oh, it works in my application... maybe it's intermittent, or i have altered the code which suppressed my desired behavior. thanks again
[16:00:18] <SDr> hdon, if you are being payed for this: refactor into a function
[16:00:33] <sjk> Is it possible to use jquery to convert a select box to normal text once something's been selected?
[16:00:42] <hdon> SDr, lol, this is just a bullshit project
[16:01:04] <hdon> SDr, i'm working on some software transformation algorithms and decided javascript/chromium/jqui would give me an easy way to mock up the research workspace
[16:01:31] <SDr> sjk, !!!UNTESTED CODE AHEAD!!!! <select id="mylittleselect" onchange="test();">...</select> .. function test() { $("#mylittleselect").html( $("#mylittleselect").val() ); }
[16:02:10] <SDr> sjk, so: sure, just please make sure to also include a <a href="#" onclick="change_selection();">Change selection</a>    link after the text for the 20% misclicks.
[16:02:34] <sjk> Interesting! Thanks, SDr
[16:02:54] <coldhead> great work everyone
[16:09:34] <zoned> anyone have any clever ideas for populating a checkbox list from json?
[16:16:45] <hdon> SDr, ah, i found out how to reproduce my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/fHJqS/
[16:17:32] <hdon> SDr, it looks like the code path for triggering an event somehow bypasses the document's handler
[16:17:39] <hdon> i suppose i'll just wrap it in a function
[16:18:25] <coldhead> zoned: http://jquery-load-json.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/list.html maybe
[16:19:42] <beachandbytes> I'm experiencing slow hover effects on a medium/large size table using css selector
[16:19:50] <beachandbytes> was wondering if anyone had any performance tips
[16:19:53] <beachandbytes> for selectors like that
[16:20:59] <hdon> beachandbytes, i ran into that a long time ago. i don't know if this is the best solution but
[16:21:39] <hdon> beachandbytes, my solution was to write my own hover function which listened for the whole table, then did its own calculations based on the pre-decided dimensions of the columns/rows to figure out which cell was being hovered
[16:22:01] <hdon> beachandbytes, actually, thinking back... this was so long ago... i believe i was doing drag-and-drop, and trying to see which cell was being "dropped" into
[16:22:22] <hdon> beachandbytes, i'm surprised that it isn't fixed. can you create a jsfiddle demonstrating the performance issue? how big is your table?
[16:22:53] <hdon> beachandbytes, are you doing anything like changing the DOM and causing large redraws? i would think today that it should be fast :o
[16:26:25] <awc737> can anyone please recommend a slick address input plugin?
[16:26:58] <say2joe> what would the plugin do?
[16:27:14] <coldhead> it would let you enter an address in a slick fashion
[16:27:19] <coldhead> one presumes
[16:27:22] <awc737> just be super slick, overall
[16:27:31] <coldhead> general slickness
[16:27:36] <awc737> maybe some extra slick
[16:27:38] <coldhead> like an oilspill in a marine sanctuary
[16:27:48] <coldhead> or a woman's love
[16:27:57] <awc737> really though, I mean lookahead functionality
[16:28:03] <awc737> address confirmation
[16:28:04] <awc737> validation
[16:28:14] <awc737> typeahead*
[16:29:21] <zeroXten> rah! ffs.. whole different markdown editor... same error. something is really broken :(
[16:29:56] <awc737> any slick ideas?
[16:31:29] <xiphiasx_> hi
[16:31:48] <xiphiasx_> i have a table, and I need this table to be displayed on 3 pages
[16:32:18] <xiphiasx_> i.e. passing data between pages
[16:32:22] <xiphiasx_> i'm using jquery mobile by the way
[16:36:26] <raj> shoky, how is position different from index?
[16:36:43] <JFranks> I have this car that I want to download, and I'm using the latest build of jQuery..
[16:37:03] <JFranks> (I love how people ask questions in this channel)
[16:37:28] <xiphiasx_> i would expect them to
[16:39:57] <awc737> does anyone know a good autocomplete address script?
[16:40:10] <awc737> I want to split my address fields into multiple, line1/line2/city/etc
[16:40:23] <awc737> rather than doing something like this: https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete
[16:40:37] <JFranks> IMHO: The question you asked is more of a app framework debate than anything related to jQuery.. I'm guessing that if your table data changes in the database (??) or on any pages, you want to update all other pages to show the change?
[16:41:21] <awc737> JFranks: whos that to
[16:41:39] <JFranks> awc737: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[16:42:31] <awc737> JFranks: but where to get the data from
[16:42:45] <awc737> I'm expected to have a column of each city, each state, each zip, etc, in the world?
[16:42:51] <awc737> that seems harder than a typical one line address lookup field
[16:42:55] <JFranks> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp or http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[16:42:57] <awc737> which is fairly easy with Google Maps
[16:43:55] <awc737> This may be my best bet http://ubilabs.github.com/geocomplete/examples/form.html
[16:43:57] <JFranks> the 2nd to last link is doing cities
[16:45:08] <JFranks> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp is a bit slower than your example but that's probably just the data source. ;)
[16:46:37] <awc737> thanks JFranks . I may just let them input using my fields, then verify their address using that plugin I linked
[16:50:48] <shoky> raj: you mean in that jsbin?
[16:51:31] <shoky> raj: the position there was what jstree reported as position, and the index was what i logged , to see if its any different/more helpful
[16:51:43] <shoky> raj: but in all the logs i saw they were equal
[18:06:32] <StephenS> what can I use jquery instead of .change ? I need ajax to start checking on page load
[18:06:36] <StephenS> I tried .load but didnt work
[18:06:49] <StephenS> $("#username").load(function() {  and it was $("#username").change(function() {
[18:07:25] <StephenS> ah .show
[18:07:28] <StephenS> meh my bad nvm :D
[18:09:08] <StephenS> but I need on load show, but when user re-edit input field to do it change how to di it>?
[18:10:34] <Che-Anarc> in jQm - Is there anyway I can #link to a layer from a <a href='#link'> without having it change the page? I'am looking for a way of setting the body based on user click.
[18:20:12] <nathanbz> anyone know a good jquery libary that will do a div popup on click, a model, dynamically positionable
[18:24:30] <darthlukan> nathanbz: jquery ui has something for that
[18:24:52] <darthlukan> it's built-in, $().dialog()
[18:45:15] <Forbidd3n> How would I check if an element is required in the rules of validator in a custom addMethod?
[19:07:51] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know a stable workaround for IE placeholder and validator?
[19:19:57] <krz> should all functions in javascript return true?
[19:21:32] <pachet> is that a joke
[19:22:15] <coldhead> having all functions return true is probably best practice
[19:22:26] <krz> slightly OT, but coffeescript http://pastie.org/6233589 returns the last method
[19:22:27] <coldhead> it makes your programs more positive
[19:22:36] <coldhead> instead of just being all undefined or false all the time
[19:23:03] <pachet> hm
[19:23:06] <pachet> accentuate the positive
[19:23:22] <coldhead> js implicitly returns undefined unless you explicitly return something more useful
[19:23:49] <coldhead> coffeescript is trying to be lispier or perlier
[19:24:01] <coldhead> i respect that
[19:28:57] <grafi> lispier
[19:29:04] <grafi> is that a word?
[19:29:28] <coldhead> "more lisp-like" if you prefer
[19:29:34] <pachet> it's definitely lispier ;[
[19:29:43] <pachet> that whole fracas with implementing hyphens-in-identifiers
[19:33:37] <grafi> lisp
[19:33:40] <grafi> hm

[19:53:07] <tw2113> beginner's luck
[19:55:31] <coldhead> the kindness kind
[19:57:30] <pachet> coldhead: the first hit is always free
[19:58:02] <coldhead> often you can get 75% off the second hit, too
[20:01:34] <raj> shoky, clever and paranoid ;)
[20:02:31] <coldhead> a powerful combo
[20:02:37] <raj> indeed

[20:04:58] <coldhead> bot-t: hey
[20:14:24] <Che-Anarc> Is it likely that by default wysihtml5/ would clash with jQm? - I cant the two to play nicely
[20:16:31] <mfoxdogg|work> hey oneliner :)

[20:23:51] <oneliner> rigged arm :D
[20:24:30] <mfoxdogg|work> :)
[20:25:09] <coldhead> D:
[20:27:37] <tw2113> is coldhead treating everyone ok?
[20:28:07] <momomomomo> I think he helped me out the other day
[20:28:16] <tw2113> not possible
[20:28:18] <coldhead> i think that was some other guy
[20:28:19] <tw2113> this is his first day here
[20:28:35] <momomomomo> do you hang out in the rails channel coldhead ?
[20:28:51] <esas_> regarding ui tabs (with ajax), can you disable the loading of tabs of they're already loaded? right now they are reloaded every time i revisit a previosly loaded tab
[20:28:53] <coldhead> not anymore
[20:29:06] <momomomomo> hm, weird - maybe it wasn't you :o
[20:29:11] <coldhead> anyway thanks for your excessive concern tw2113
[20:29:22] <tw2113> just protecting everyone from you
[20:29:26] <coldhead> you're like the panicky mother who died giving birth to me
[20:29:34] <coldhead> risen from the grave
[20:29:36] <tw2113> i don't want you responsible for $ is not defined errors
[20:30:18] <esas_> {cache: false} only gives the appearance of not reloading the tab :\
[20:32:07] <oneliner> esas_, iirc i think you got it perfectly backwards? cache:true will prevent reloads?
[20:33:37] <b1lly> bahhhhhh
[20:34:27] <esas_> oneliner: oh, sorry.. yes, i meant cache:true :) if cache is false, the innerhtml of the tab is reset when you press the tab, then loaded with content when ajax completes
[20:34:51] <esas_> if cache is true, the only thing that differs is that the content isnt reset when you click the tab.. the ajax call still goes out, though
[20:35:20] <esas_> so it looks like everything is grand, but when i added a rand() from php into what is loaded, i noticed it reloads the content
[20:36:49] <esas_> soo i extended ui.tabs to override the load method (adds a class to each tab that is loaded, so it doesnt get loaded again), and added a noLoadIfLoaded option to ui.tabs
[20:37:30] <esas_> so now everything is fine, i just wanted to know if it was redundant to do? :)
[20:39:08] <esas_> also had to add a reload function, since load is usually how people reload a tab.. so it's a bit hacky (although nothing is modified in jquery.ui.js or .css)
[20:39:29] <oneliner> its a secret conspiracy with hosting providers to increase your transfer expenditure
[20:40:27] <esas_> haha, that's why i did it, too
[20:40:28] <coldhead> turns out you can just spend all day listening to bjork
[20:40:58] <oneliner> she talks that much huh?
[20:41:15] <coldhead> if you loop her, sure
[20:53:56] <naeluh> hi everyone!
[20:54:09] <b1lly> hi
[20:55:50] <coldhead> momomomomo: i will never forget you
[20:57:49] <raj> shoky, what if I want to create a node in an empty tree?
[20:58:58] <b1lly> raj: hmm?
[20:59:06] <raj> hi b1lly
[20:59:10] <b1lly> $(document).append ?
[20:59:32] <raj> I'm referring to our earlier conversation
[20:59:47] <b1lly> I see, can you elaborate?
[21:00:02] <raj> he wrote a little script, and I was asking about it
[21:00:10] <raj> had to do with a ul/li list
[21:00:18] <raj> and how to create the first li  in there
[21:00:28] <b1lly> is the ul empty?
[21:00:40] <b1lly> or does the ul have li elements already
[21:01:02] <raj> oh, nm, you just made me think
[21:01:04] <raj> thank you ;)
[21:01:06] <raj> the ul is empty
[21:01:09] <raj> so I can just add an li
[21:01:13] <b1lly> .prepend()
[21:01:16] <raj> thought there was no ul actually
[21:02:08] <b1lly> I see
[21:02:15] <b1lly> prepend adds to beginning of an element, append to the end
[21:03:14] <raj> gotcha
[21:03:25] <raj> it's an empty element, so either works
[21:03:52] <b1lly> great success
[21:03:57] <raj> :)
[21:16:33] <raj> I like separating my page rendering code from my eventhandling code
[21:16:48] <raj> so if I was to run a jq plugin on an element, it would be in the render code
[21:17:47] <raj> but if I wanted to say $('#same_element_plugin_was_initialized_upon').on('something', ...) I'd like to have that in `function eventHandler()`
[21:17:54] <raj> how can I do that?
[21:18:24] <raj> I have to be sure the plugin is finished initializing on the element before doing the eventhandler on it (since it's a plugin specific event)
[21:23:11] <b1lly> raj:  so put it in function eventHandler()
[21:23:31] <b1lly> but it wont be bound and start listning until you call the eventHandler() function
[22:21:53] <eckesicle> Hello. I'm getting the following error message in firebug: "Empty string passed to getelementbyid()" The jquery bugtracker refers to this chat channel
[22:23:41] <coldhead> are you passing some kind of empty string somewhere?
[22:23:57] <coldhead> can you link us to the bugtracker that brought you here eckesicle ?
[22:24:05] <coldhead> the specfic bug i mean
[22:24:32] <eckesicle> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12761
[22:25:01] <eckesicle> I added a click event with on
[22:25:03] <coldhead> danke
[22:25:34] <eckesicle> and then it started appearing. I tried commenting it out, but now it's still there.
[22:25:36] <eckesicle> It's weird.
[22:26:08] <coldhead> can you link to a demo or recreate it on jsfiddle?
[22:27:49] <krz> what method can i use to replace all chars _ with -
[22:27:51] <eckesicle> let me reconnect and bring my server online and i'll show you
[22:28:04] <krz> so foo_bar_foo will return foo-bar-foo
[22:28:42] <raj> b1lly, i call the eventHandler() function after renderPage(), but what if the plugin isn't finished rendering before eventHandler() is run?
[22:29:02] <krz> replace()
[22:30:08] <fat> IF i remove the virtual tabs from my website (http://www.lolplanet.net/without/) my panels work. However, if i leave the virtual tabs, my panels stop working. http://www.lolplanet.net/ how do i fix this?
[22:31:04] <coldhead> js> "foo_bar_foo".replace('_', '-');
[22:31:06] <b-ot> coldhead: No output.
[22:31:17] <coldhead> js> console.log("foo_bar_foo".replace('_', '-'));
[22:31:19] <b-ot> coldhead: No output.
[22:31:24] <coldhead> you're crummy, b-ot
[22:34:37] <eckesicle> coldhead: http://213.112.233.166/
[22:35:33] <eckesicle> click anywhere in the document
[22:35:37] <eckesicle> and you'll see the error
[22:36:49] <eckesicle> and if you look in the stack the error appears on line 2750 in jquery.js
[22:36:58] <eckesicle> jQuery.event.dispatch.apply
[22:38:29] <coldhead> i don't see that in my firebug
[22:38:35] <coldhead> but i guess i am in an old version
[22:39:16] <coldhead> eckesicle: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/5566
[22:39:16] <b-ot> coldhead: Issue #5566 by rossmeissl (4mon 3d ago): Clicking anywhere generates JS warnings in Firefox iff a dropdown menu is present
[22:39:21] <coldhead> that sounds like your exact issue
[22:39:26] <coldhead> and there it is related to bootstrap
[22:39:30] <coldhead> it is apparently fixed
[22:39:37] <coldhead> so check if you're using the latest version?
[22:39:52] <coldhead> fixed 2 months ago by @fat
[22:39:58] <eckesicle> hmm i am. Downloaded it yesterday
[22:40:06] <eckesicle> but perhaps it has not yet been pushed to stable
[22:40:14] <eckesicle> thanks for the help
[22:40:14] <coldhead> oh, reading further, not fixed
[22:40:19] <eckesicle> aaah
[22:40:41] <coldhead> this looks like it fixes it for you if you canbe bothered https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/5566#issuecomment-13566098
[22:40:42] <b-ot> coldhead: Issue #5566 by rossmeissl (4mon 3d ago): Clicking anywhere generates JS warnings in Firefox iff a dropdown menu is present
[22:41:03] <coldhead> interesting issue
[22:43:06] <coldhead> eckesicle: if you add a comment to that issue it will bring pressure to get it fixed AND you can get a notification if they ever actually properly fix it
[22:43:27] <eckesicle> hmm
[22:43:36] <eckesicle> okay i got it fixed now
[22:43:48] <eckesicle> i guess i'll comment for good measure :)
[22:44:26] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:44:44] <eckesicle> thanks
[22:45:36] <fat> helP?
[22:49:59] <coldhead> ah fat, you so crazy
[22:50:24] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: he so fat
[22:53:28] <raj> is it sloppy to get an element's html data attribute via .data()?
[22:55:00] <coldhead> no raj
[22:55:02] <coldhead> not at all
[22:55:26] <systemfault> No, it's not.. it's just that modifying data won't modify the attribute...
[22:55:32] <raj> k, thanks
[22:55:54] <raj> i just thought, I should separate the use of .data() to make sure it's jq's data
[22:56:15] <raj> and stick to some other method when I know it's html data attribute
[22:56:34] <systemfault> raj: You pretty much never need to modify attributes.
[22:56:49] <systemfault> Attributes are a way to get information from the HTML when it is parsed.
[22:57:11] <raj> yeah
[22:57:15] <raj> this is true
[22:58:15] <b1lly> is there a way to .trigger()
[22:58:19] <b1lly> on a .on()
[22:58:32] <systemfault> Yeah... .trigger :/
[22:58:36] <b1lly> no works
[22:58:54] <systemfault> It should.
[22:59:27] <b1lly> nope
[22:59:29] <systemfault> myElement.on('click', function() { alert("lol"); }); myElement.trigger('click');
[22:59:47] <systemfault> b1lly: Then write a testcode.
[22:59:52] <b1lly> $('body').on('click', 'sel', function() { // }
[22:59:52] <systemfault> Saying nope won't help.
[23:00:02] <b1lly> $('sel').trigger();
[23:00:08] <didiergm> hello to all - my first question here.
[23:00:53] <Nebros> Good morning everybody. i have here a js which filter me an option list. at first, i have the lines with diffrent colors, (grey, white, grey, white...) but when i use now this filter, the values in the option list are not colored anymore. how can i change this? i beleve it must be between lines105 - 164... http://jsfiddle.net/eqXbL/
[23:01:30] <didiergm> I am confused in JQM between .on, .live, .bind what is the recommended (future proof) way docs say on thing but examples do another.
[23:01:42] <Nebros> and didiergm, you dont need to say its your first question and you dont have to ask if you can ask one. just ask... =)
[23:01:48] <systemfault> b1lly http://jsfiddle.net/JbPV5/
[23:01:58] <didiergm> OK Nebros
[23:02:37] <systemfault> didiergm .on is the only good way to bind events now... you can forget about bind/delegate/live
[23:03:56] <systemfault> didiergm: just saw that you were talking about JQM... then I'm not sure.
[23:04:04] <didiergm> so .on works as .live ? ie new elements added dynamically will be automatically bound ?
[23:04:22] <systemfault> didiergm: Yeah.. .on has two syntax
[23:04:28] <b1lly> stupid meteor
[23:04:37] <b1lly> isn't rendering dom properly
[23:04:55] <didiergm> Not being sure I always .off then .on but seems like a waste of processing power
[23:04:57] <coldhead> good work everyone
[23:05:34] <systemfault> didiergm element.on(event, handler); is like bind.... parent.on(event, selector, handler); is like .live/.delegate
[23:06:18] <didiergm> kk this is where I got confused. Thanks
[23:06:19] <fat> How do I create a close button for this tabs. http://jsfiddle.net/frabiacca/7pM7h/5/
[23:09:44] <coldhead> fat: you can't usually close tabs
[23:09:49] <coldhead> i don't understand
[23:10:06] <fat> coldhead: thats why i want a close button so i can close the tabs
[23:11:26] <didiergm> jqm: if there a standard way to determine if element has already been rendered/enhanced ? like a jqm-data-enhanced=true for all widgets ?
[23:12:22] <didiergm> or is it specific per widget (sometimes check is container has this class or descendant is ...
[23:14:03] <jacta> mornings
[23:14:30] <coldhead> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/7pM7h/20/
[23:14:38] <coldhead> i have no idea what i'm doing
[23:15:46] <fat> coldhead: good enough, thx
[23:30:59] <Nebros> i have here a js which filter me an option list. at first, i have the lines with diffrent colors, (grey, white, grey, white...) but when i use now this filter, the values in the option list are not colored anymore. how can i fix this? i beleve it must be between lines105 - 164... http://jsfiddle.net/eqXbL/
[23:33:50] <didiergm>                                    nebros where are the colors 'stored in your list ? css/property .....
[23:35:57] <didiergm> Nebros from what I see you just copy text & options; no other info so how could you get colors ?
[23:37:02] <raj> how can I prevent clickoutside from triggering while i'm in the console?
[23:49:56] <Nebros> sry didiergm, i had a meeting. i have this line:   <option class="{% cycle 'eins' 'zwei' %}">{{ column|cut:"'"|cut:"("|cut:")" }}</option>   in my html (yes its a bit django) and the colors are given in the css...
