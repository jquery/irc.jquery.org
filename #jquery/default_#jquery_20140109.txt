[00:04:30] <fattest> im trying to add additional gallery elements for bootstrap image gallery, however the description label is not appearing! please help: my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/26 bootstrap image gallery documentation https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery/blob/master/README.md
[00:05:39] <Uhkis> fattest: i despise bootstrap, sorry
[00:07:11] <rec> hello, im trying to get the contents of a webpage form to get data to work with using jquery, what is the easiest way to do this?
[00:11:32] <jphase> rec: you'll have to be more specific, you want to get data from a form?
[00:15:20] <rec> jphase: there is a site that exists that gives a select block with information i need to gather before producing results, i need to get the data from the site before my javascript page renders
[00:16:26] <jphase> rec: is this site external? a URL that is from a different location than where your js is?
[00:17:44] <rec> jphase: im writing my app for local use only, basically need something similar to a tool like curl, just go grab the raw data to work with
[00:18:24] <Cork> rec: are you using chrome code or content (as in on a webpage) ?
[00:18:25] <jphase> rec: the site you want to scrape data from will have to allow CORS requests
[00:18:35] <rec> Cork: content
[00:18:45] <Cork> rec: then you are out of luck
[00:18:56] <Cork> unless you have control of the site you want to query
[00:18:57] <jphase> ah yeah, if you're not hosting on apache or something locally :\
[00:19:19] <Cork> jphase: that wouldn't help
[00:19:23] <rec> jphase: it does not seem to support cors
[00:19:30] <jphase> then no dice
[00:19:39] <Cork> also file:// can never do cors requests
[00:19:54] <jphase> right
[00:19:56] <rec> Cork: ah, well then
[00:20:01] <jphase> that's why I mentioned locally hosting through apache
[00:22:14] <rec> so, the only way to do something like this is to have a button on my app use curl or something similar to grab the html, then do something with the temp file?
[00:22:35] <Cork> rec: the best solution would be to have a webserver
[00:22:40] <Cork> and have it proxy the query
[00:22:55] <Cork> server code doesn't care about xss
[00:23:01] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:23:07] <Cork> (neither does chrome code)
[00:23:18] <Cork> chrome code btw means browser privileged code
[00:23:43] <Cork> so ya, that is another option
[00:23:53] <Cork> you could provide a way to do it from an extension to the browser
[00:24:12] <Cork> but be careful so you don't create a security problem for your self
[00:24:13] <rec> Cork: ive never looked at 'chrome code' -- so i could load an iframe and grab using chrome code?
[00:24:20] <Cork> no
[00:24:29] <Cork> chrome code is extension code for the browser
[00:24:45] <Cork> content can't ever use it directly
[00:24:53] <Cork> unless an extension exposes it to the content
[00:25:13] <Cork> and then it has to be careful not to cause a security hole
[00:25:32] <rec> Cork: alright, ill investigate it
[00:25:39] <rec> Cork: thank you for your help
[00:37:16] <christophler> hi
[00:37:36] <nicolas> hi there
[00:37:45] <fabioportieri> what do you think of angular?
[00:37:52] <christophler> Im loading a file from the server with ajax {dataType: "json"} The file is throwing a "expected } or identifier" error
[00:38:11] <christophler> the response in Firebug actually has a JSON object in it
[00:38:24] <christophler> for the life of me I dont understand what is wrong with the contents of the .json file
[00:38:34] <nicolas> got a question about validate plugin for jquery : I don't really get the way "groups" and "errorPlacement" are linked, and how to use "groups" in general. I'm reading the example at http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ but not helping
[00:38:46] <Cork> christophler: check so the content-type header is correct
[00:38:56] <Cork> dataType is only what js will request
[00:39:00] <Cork> not what the server sends back
[00:39:12] <christophler> http://pastebin.com/rMC76SH5
[00:39:17] <christophler> that is the whole contents of the file
[00:39:27] <Cork> christophler: check the headers
[00:39:59] <Cork> Content-Type	application/json; charset=utf-8 <--
[00:40:00] <rec> alright i have one more for you, i have a file that is located on my hard drive that i would to gain access to in jquery (so the local path is ./other_stuff.html)
[00:40:02] <christophler> ok, I think I got it
[00:40:04] <Cork> this is important
[00:41:00] <Cork> rec: $.get('other_stuff.html')
[00:42:01] <jost> christophler: I comments are not allowed in JSON files
[00:42:12] <christophler> content type header is application/json
[00:42:14] <rec> Cork: lovely, solved my dillemma by launching the index.html file using a script that curls the page to get data storing it in other_stuff.html, this will work for now and be able to be fixed later, thanks much for your help
[00:42:27] <christophler> http://pastebin.com/rMC76SH5
[00:42:32] <christophler> are there any comments in there?
[00:42:33] <christophler> oh
[00:42:35] <christophler> right
[00:42:38] <christophler> thanks!
[00:42:56] <Cork> christophler: for future reference

[01:02:51] <Inspiral> hey guys, I have a div that is loaded by some jquery (its a gallery plugin). I am trying to move the caption div outside of the actual gallery div (it is nested inside) I cannot seem to get the .detach().appendto working with the .on() function can you help out? I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/p4PQ5/1/
[01:04:10] <Cork> Inspiral: detatch isn't needed
[01:04:18] <Cork> just append it where you want it
[01:05:24] <Cork> Inspiral: is this what you're looking for http://jsfiddle.net/p4PQ5/2/ ?
[01:12:32] <Inspiral> Cork: no, the item is loaded after the document has loaded so it needs the .on() function...right?
[01:12:53] <Cork> no on won't help you
[01:13:05] <Cork> you will have to find a callback from what is loading it
[01:13:23] <Cork> on is for events
[01:13:33] <Inspiral> what about .delegate() ?
[01:13:33] <Cork> and events is almost exclusively for user interactions
[01:13:38] <Cork> same thing
[01:13:39] <Inspiral> oh i see
[01:13:49] <Cork> on is just bind + delegate
[01:14:05] <Inspiral> so if i used it with a .click() it would be ok, but as it doesn't have any interaction except the load it needs the callback from the loader?
[01:14:18] <Cork> yes
[01:14:29] <Cork> the load event is on page load, not additional content
[01:14:34] <Cork> same for ready
[01:14:41] <Inspiral> understood, thank you
[01:17:11] <enzo> hello
[01:17:34] <enzo> I'd like a basename() function, it exists in jquery?
[01:17:58] <Cork> for urls you mean?
[01:18:10] <enzo> for path like /foo/bar/myfile.html Cork
[01:18:17] <enzo> => myfile.html here to get
[01:18:31] <Cork> so urls; and no
[01:18:40] <Cork> you need a separate lib/plugin for that
[01:18:46] <enzo> ok
[01:20:20] <Cork> enzo: https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl might give you what you want
[01:20:29] <Cork> or you could just use regex
[01:20:57] <enzo> or file.split('/').reverse()[0] Cork
[01:21:17] <jphase> that's what I normally do :\
[01:21:18] <Cork> that won't handle params or hashes
[01:21:38] <enzo> it's a linux path I need to parse, not an url indeed
[01:52:13] <HelperW_> Hmmm
[01:52:14] <HelperW_> <input class="del-btn btn-danger" type="button" value="Remove">
[01:52:22] <HelperW_> Im tyring to change that value to some other word
[01:52:47] <HelperW_> What am I doing wrong? I tried:   $('#webform-component-werkspecifieke-informatie .btn-danger').attr('value','Verwijder');
[01:53:00] <HelperW_> And: $('#webform-component-werkspecifieke-informatie .btn-danger').val('Verwijder');
[01:53:04] <HelperW_> But that seems not to be working.
[01:57:03] <jkingaround> HelperW_: is the id on a seperate element? perhaps take a look at this stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1041344/jquery-multiple-class-selector
[01:57:32] <jkingaround> and it'll be .vali()
[01:57:35] <jkingaround> *val()
[01:57:41] <HelperW_> Thanks a lot Im going to check it out.
[02:00:55] <HelperW_> for some reason it's not yet working
[02:01:15] <HelperW_> This is the strucuture;  http://i.imgur.com/rbVrZc8.png
[02:01:16] <HelperW_>  
[02:01:27] <HelperW_> I would like to change the remove value.
[02:02:40] <HelperW_> change* it into an other name.
[02:02:44] <jkingaround> make a jsfiddle?
[02:03:07] <jkingaround> and i'll see what i can do:)
[02:06:51] <HelperW_> http://jsfiddle.net/cy7Kh/
[02:07:49] <ghostlines> ahoy, I want to pass a var to a jquery selector like so  $("img[src$='+val.image+']") .However this isn't working
[02:08:24] <ghostlines> if I type the full image path then it does work, how could I possible work around this?
[02:09:37] <nullfrog> Hey, just a quick question about performance. I've had the practice of defining elements at the start of the script like this: var $app = $(".app"); var $controls = $app.find(".controls") and so on, up to a couple of levels deep. I'm doing this so the selectors can easily be changed and the code looks cleaner when referencing the elements.
[02:09:50] <HelperW_> jkarsrud:  You have to select jquery lib I think.
[02:09:59] <nullfrog> I'm just wondering if there's any drawbacks to my approach
[02:11:54] <nullfrog> Like does the find() happen every time I reference the element, or is it only performed once when I define it?
[02:15:28] <jkingaround> HelperW_: i haved no idea thats wierd.. lol
[02:15:43] <HelperW_> Weird issue
[02:16:23] <Uhkis> ghostlines: i think you want: $("img[src$='"+val.image+"']")
[02:18:28] <ghostlines> Uhkis: dude! much respect thanks a lot!
[02:18:52] <HelperW_> Someone else an idea how I can update the value 'remove' to something else?
[02:18:53] <HelperW_> http://jsfiddle.net/cy7Kh/
[02:18:55] <HelperW_>  thanks!!!
[02:19:24] <Uhkis> ghostlines: np
[02:20:39] <jkingaround> HelperW_: figured it out. the fiddle didn't have jquery loaded. double check you're actually loading it :)
[02:21:04] <jkingaround> http://jsfiddle.net/cy7Kh/3/
[02:26:53] <HelperW_> Very weird in my online version it's not working
[02:27:21] <HelperW_> And jQuery is loaded :)
[02:27:37] <jkingaround> hmm quite odd. double check that space is in between there?
[02:27:39] <jkingaround> -shrug-
[02:27:48] <HelperW_> The space is there I copied your line
[02:28:39] <seutje> just blame drupal :P
[02:28:49] <HelperW_> hahah :P
[02:28:50] <HelperW_> I could
[02:29:17] <seutje> but isn't that label translatable?
[02:29:33] <HelperW_> Im checking that now :)
[02:29:42] <seutje> oh wait, webform... right
[02:29:48] <HelperW_> Indeed
[02:33:16] <Azrael_-> hi
[02:33:24] <Azrael_-> i've got a form with 2 fields i validate them with jquery-validation and remote-functions. if i don't enter any field and directly try to submit the form, then the first submit is used for validating the fields with ajax-requests. only the second submit works as desired. how can i change this behaviour?
[02:33:35] <HelperW_> How is this even possible: $('.btn-danger').val('Verwijder');
[02:33:38] <HelperW_> that is also not working.
[02:33:42] <seutje> https://drupal.org/project/webform_localization might be useful, otherwise, you could just hook hook_form_alter, where id is 'webform_client_form' and alter the label https://drupal.org/comment/227465#comment-227465
[02:36:39] <seutje> Azrael_-: did you specify debug: true by any chance?
[02:39:02] <HelperW_> I have that one enabled seutje but I can't find any access to that button
[02:39:07] <HelperW_> To change the text.
[02:39:57] <seutje> HelperW_: the localization module? not entirely sure it works as expected tbh
[02:40:14] <HelperW_> i used it sometimes but in this case it's not working.
[02:42:53] <seutje> HelperW_: thing is, if you change it in the frontend, Drupal might be all "Y U TAMPERING WITH MY FORMS?"
[02:43:02] <seutje> but not sure if that also applies to button values
[02:44:29] <nicolas> hi there, anyone know (with validation plugin) how to set a field to be valid when he and another field are not empty ?
[02:46:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to disable logging of chrome extensions in the developer tools?
[02:47:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it keeps logging all kinds of junk that's not relevant
[02:49:11] <seutje> nicolas: use the dependency expression or callback: http://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method/
[02:50:28] <Amnesia> question, I'm using the following line: $("#myTable first").clone().appendTo("#myTable");, but nothing happens when I trigger it
[02:50:37] <Amnesia> what exactly could be the problem here?
[02:51:09] <Amnesia> I gave the tbody the "myTable" id, but I also tried it using a table id element
[02:51:41] <fabioportieri> what's first??
[02:51:41] <seutje> Amnesia: <first> is not an element
[02:51:51] <seutje> did you mean #myTable:first ?
[02:51:51] <Amnesia> :first *
[02:51:55] <Amnesia> yeah
[02:52:13] <anli_> Where do I see the element layout in chrome?
[02:52:15] <Amnesia> eventually I need to clone a specific row, using var rowID= $(this).closest('tr').attr('id');
[02:52:29] <anli_> margin, border, padding visually represented
[02:52:32] <Amnesia> but first I'm trying to just clone the upper row to the bottom of the table
[02:52:33] <seutje> Amnesia: ur cloning the entire table and appending it to itself?
[02:53:04] <Amnesia> seutje: not that I know, but since I'm a complete rookie at javascript in general, I might be doing that yes..
[02:53:06] <anli_> Oh, its under "computed"
[02:53:27] <seutje> Amnesia: #myTable:first is essentially the same as #myTable, as ID selectors only return a single element
[02:53:37] <Amnesia> hm ok
[02:53:38] <seutje> I'm assuming this is the entire table
[02:54:28] <seutje> so you'll end up with <table id=myTable><tbody><tr>...</tr></tbody><table id=myTable><tbody><tr>...</tr></tbody></table></table>
[02:54:51] <Amnesia> seutje: currently I've got the following : https://privatepaste.com/b8fa7b01eb
[02:55:07] <Amnesia> ah, that's not desireable ^^
[02:55:20] <Amnesia> what should I do in order to just select one row?
[02:55:23] <Amnesia> tr that is
[02:55:32] <seutje> should probably be #myTable tr:first
[02:56:00] <Amnesia> $("#myTable tr:first").clone().appendTo("#myTable"); ?
[02:56:06] <seutje> unless ur already nesting tables
[02:56:12] <Amnesia> sweet, that works:D
[02:56:18] <seutje> actually no, even then it should work
[02:56:48] <Amnesia> sweet, now I'm going to try and clone a specific row
[02:56:52] <Amnesia> thx seutje!
[02:57:17] <Amnesia> is it possible to substitute :first for an int?
[02:57:31] <Amnesia> or should it be tr id.eq($int) ?
[02:57:32] <seutje> use :nth-child(n)
[02:57:37] <seutje> or eq, yeah
[02:57:46] <seutje> but eq is 0-indexed, nth-child is 1-indexed
[02:57:53] <seutje> and nth-child is in relation to the parent
[02:59:02] <seutje> like if you had multiple tables (nested or not), nth-child would give the nth of every table, whereas eq only trurns a single one
[03:02:04] <Amnesia> ty
[03:02:08] <Amnesia> let me give that a shot:)
[03:03:32] <Amnesia> and do double quotes imply interpolation is being applied?
[03:04:59] <nicolas> seutje > I don't think dependency expression would help me here, as they're used to send true or false depending on some fields. I don't want to put "require : true" depending on some fields, I want my field A to be valid only if field A is not empty AND field B is not empty
[03:05:20] <Amnesia> $("#myTable tr.attr('id').eq(rowID)").clone().appendTo("#myTable");
[03:05:59] <Cork> <_<'
[03:06:15] <Cork> you can't have commands in the selector
[03:06:55] <Amnesia> thought so:P
[03:06:59] <Amnesia> what'd be the correct syntax?
[03:07:06] <Cork> $("#myTable #" + rowID).clone() should work though
[03:07:10] <Amnesia> and is it actually possible to use variables in selectors?
[03:07:17] <Cork> or just $("#" + rowID).clone()
[03:07:26] <Amnesia> what does the second # stand for?
[03:07:30] <Amnesia> in your first example
[03:07:33] <Cork> attr('id') <--
[03:07:51] <Cork> but the #myTable isn't needed
[03:07:58] <Cork> you already have an unique id
[03:08:04] <Cork> so $("#" + rowID).clone()
[03:08:17] <Cork> though don't forget to change the id of the clone
[03:08:31] <Amnesia> hm
[03:08:37] <Amnesia> and the + does what?
[03:08:50] <Amnesia> guess it doesn't add^^
[03:08:50] <Cork> so $("#" + rowID).clone().each(function() { this.id += 'something new'; }).appendTo()
[03:08:54] <seutje> nicolas: so set field A to be required when field B is filled out
[03:08:55] <Asmoooh> the makes it #rowid
[03:08:56] <Asmoooh> basiclly
[03:09:05] <Cork> Asmoooh: no
[03:09:09] <Asmoooh> normally rowID should be the var?
[03:09:10] <seutje> nicolas: the page I linked to has as example of just that
[03:09:12] <Cork> rowID is outside the selector
[03:09:17] <Cork> yes
[03:09:18] <Asmoooh> hm
[03:09:52] <Cork> js> var rowID = 'ab100'; print("#" + rowID)
[03:09:56] <Asmoooh> yeah
[03:09:59] <b-ot> Cork: #ab100
[03:09:59] <Asmoooh> makes it #ab100
[03:10:00] <Asmoooh> ;)
[03:10:16] <Amnesia> just a sec
[03:10:21] <Amnesia> letting this sink in:P
[03:10:29] <Asmoooh> thats what i ment
[03:11:09] <nicolas> seutje >  what if field B is not filled ? require will be false and thus field A won't be required, or ?
[03:13:14] <Amnesia> Cork: so $("#" + rowID).clone() in pseudo code is "Select the row where id (#) equals $rowID" ?
[03:13:29] <Cork> kinda ya
[03:13:35] <Azrael_-> seutje: no
[03:13:36] <Cork> and make a clone of the dom element
[03:13:43] <Amnesia> eh yeah:P
[03:13:45] <nicolas> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[03:13:51] <nicolas> seutje > got it
[03:14:16] <Amnesia> Cork: doesn't clone() itself change the id?
[03:14:20] <Cork> no
[03:14:29] <Cork> that wouldn't be a clone
[03:14:36] <Amnesia> true that
[03:14:40] <seutje> that would be a clown!
[03:14:44] <Cork> :)
[03:14:51] <Amnesia> and then we're talking about the id of the table row right?
[03:14:51] <nicolas> don't get it finally..
[03:53:33] <nicolas> seutje > here is a jsfiddle with the code : http://jsfiddle.net/wQgeT/, but it doesn't work as espected
[03:58:04] <seutje> wait, so B is always required and A is only required if B is filled out, right?
[03:58:10] <seutje> ergo, both are always required?
[03:58:22] <seutje> nicolas: ^
[03:59:52] <nicolas> seutje : both are always required, but none should be ok if empty or if the other is empty
[04:00:11] <seutje> so just make em both required?
[04:00:45] <nicolas> seutje : no, because as I'm writing in the same span for the success, if second field is ok, then it will erase the error from 1st field
[04:00:47] <seutje> seems useless to flag a field as invalid when in fact, the other one is invalid
[04:01:33] <nicolas> seutje > well, it's flagging a couple of field more than a field in particular that I would like
[04:12:41] <Amnesia> question... $("#" + rowID).clone().appendTo("#myTable"); is returning "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #" while it has been working a few min ago
[04:12:57] <Amnesia> what could the the cause for this exception to be thrown..?
[04:13:28] <Cork> cgecj wat rowID  is
[04:13:31] <Cork> *check
[04:14:00] <Cork> the error is from sizzle trying to parse the value sent to jquery as a selector and failing cause it isn't one
[04:14:24] <boobsbr> howdy
[04:14:24] <Amnesia> ah ty
[04:14:31] <Amnesia> Cork: found it, muchas gracias
[04:15:06] <boobsbr> is there a way to list all changes from one jquery version to another? like a dynamic changelog?
[04:15:19] <Cork> boobsbr: github
[04:15:27] <boobsbr> Cork: oh
[04:15:34] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[04:15:41] <Inspiral> hey Cork I asked earlier about not being able to use on() with something that required a callback. I was wondering what the technical term for this problem was (if any)?
[04:15:46] <boobsbr> Cork: I was trying the blog and the API docs... =)
[04:16:24] <Cork> Inspiral: not sure there is a technical term for it
[04:16:38] <Cork> Inspiral: you where trying to work on an element before it existed
[04:16:50] <Cork> and what created the element didn't produce an event
[04:17:05] <Cork> though those normally accepts callbacks
[04:18:33] <Inspiral> cool, it was just so I could try and explain it in a clear way
[04:23:07] <boobsbr> Cork: Is there a changelog or release notes file?
[04:23:35] <Cork> boobsbr: no i meant you can set one branch and the start
[04:23:42] <Cork> and another release as the end
[04:23:57] <Cork> and github will show you all the commits in between
[04:24:24] <boobsbr> I did that, for 1.4.2 to master, and it's humongous
[04:24:39] <Cork> uh...
[04:24:41] <boobsbr> it was looking for a summary of changes
[04:24:48] <Cork> ya .1.4.2 is like several years old
[04:24:51] <boobsbr> yup
[04:25:06] <Cork> there isn't a summary of changes cross several releases
[04:25:17] <Cork> the blog will talk about the highlights for each release
[04:26:21] <boobsbr> I was tasked with looking for a newer version that doesn't remove any functions we use across a huge number of pages...
[04:26:26] <boobsbr> so basically I'm screwed
[04:26:42] <Cork> boobsbr: well check the api.jquery.com
[04:26:50] <Cork> it lists what version a function exists in
[04:27:17] <Cork> ex.
[04:27:19] <Cork> live: version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9
[04:27:30] <Cork> and version added: 1.3
[04:28:01] <boobsbr> yup, that's what I was looking for, but in a more programmatic way than browsing the blog entries
[04:28:03] <Cork> it also list where different parts of the function was added
[04:28:17] <Cork> boobsbr: the api is the best one you can get
[04:28:31] <Cork> and honestly it is quite good compared to what you usually find
[04:28:56] <boobsbr> yeah, it's quite good
[04:29:36] <boobsbr> since jqueryui has a changelog page, I thought jquery might have one too, but it doesn't
[04:30:27] <boobsbr> thanks for the help
[04:30:28] <Cork> boobsbr: well.. ya
[04:30:38] <Cork> if you prefer to scan several years of http://blog.jquery.com/category/jquery/
[04:30:52] <Cork> you're welcome to do that...
[04:31:18] <Cork> not sure how that is simpler then checking what version a specific function exists in
[04:31:34] <Cork> boobsbr: appart from that
[04:31:50] <boobsbr> no easy way out for me
[04:31:52] <Cork> boobsbr: i can say from experience that 1.5 and 1.7 is two biggies when upgrading jquery
[04:32:08] <Cork> 1.9 is just a few function removals
[04:32:15] <Cork> and is quite easy to handle
[04:32:40] <Cork> 1.5 was a monster and took ages to handle as it changed how events bubbles in jquery
[04:32:46] <boobsbr> I still have to read hundreds of pages and a bunch of libs and look for javascript code
[04:33:03] <boobsbr> cork: that's sounding scary
[04:34:01] <Cork> boobsbr: it was, it broke most of the page to unusable
[04:34:53] <boobsbr> gee
[04:35:14] <boobsbr> and guess what, we don't have automated interface tests...
[04:35:54] <boobsbr> so, now way to know what'll break if I update jquery
[04:36:15] <Cork> boobsbr: so just drop a newer version into a test server and test it
[04:36:22] <Cork> might be a good time to write tests too
[04:37:41] <boobsbr> it was a good time to write tests 4 years ago... but the devs back then didn't care, apparently
[04:38:23] <boobsbr> well, I must go face my work
[04:38:32] <boobsbr> thanks for the help
[04:38:50] <jost> I've got a jQuery mobile slider widget (http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/) on a page, and want to submit its value using AJAX every time something has changed. What event should I attach to? I've obviously tried the 'change' event, but that is fired way to often when the slider is moved. Focusout does not fire when only the slider is moved. Any other way?
[04:41:31] <jost> Problem is that I can't really use widget-specific events (then "slidestop" would work), since the same event has to be used for many other inputs and widgets.
[05:03:08] <tboerger> hi... maybe somebody can help me with triggering and catching custom events on 1.7?
[05:08:46] <dadonp> Hi guys. Im using ui-state-hover on a table row. However, the hover state changes to bold weight which changes the table width, quite annoying when youre trying to select a row. What is the workaround for this problem?
[05:10:33] <limpc> hi. how do i prevent an image from getting cloned and dragged around by default browser behavior, when implementing a drag routine?
[05:12:44] <ravenzz> so I have a ~100kb json file. Do you think that it could be too heavy to mobile devices when converted in js object?
[05:15:33] <caitp> hey, is it possible to copy the entire expandostore of one element into another one?
[05:18:38] <seutje> caitp: $.cache[el[$.expando]] iirc
[05:19:06] <caitp> mmm... is there by any chance a public API for it?
[05:19:18] <caitp> https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5099#issuecomment-31929676 trying to find a fix for this
[05:19:47] <seutje> hmm wait, it changed on recent versions, I think
[05:19:49] <caitp> I worry that using a non-public API would cause problems when it changes
[05:24:01] <limpc> anyone? how do i prevent default browser behavior when you mousedown on an image and start dragging it?
[05:25:18] <seutje> .on('startdrag', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); })
[05:25:22] <seutje> limpc: ^
[05:27:21] <seutje> caitp: can't find any reference to a robust solution that doesn't involve digging into the internal expando stuff
[05:27:51] <caitp> I think I have a solution
[05:28:10] <caitp> assuming $(element).data() should always return the entire data hash for the object
[05:28:20] <limpc> seutje: thanks
[05:28:51] <seutje> caitp: that's only the .data data and data- attributes data
[05:28:51] <Cork> caitp: not sure if that is what your looking for
[05:29:00] <seutje> it doens't include event handlers for instance
[05:29:09] <Cork> but if you clone an element you can have it copy the store
[05:29:20] <Cork> (for it and all it's children)
[05:29:20] <caitp> I don't think clone is totally an option
[05:29:27] <seutje> not sure if that's an option in this case
[05:29:59] <seutje> it's a replaceWith using a compiled template as the content replacing the element
[05:30:18] <caitp> https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c894470d4122913168dd75f829f1d19c4af696ed/src/ng/compile.js#L1854 this is the routine, and I don't think we can fit clone into that
[05:30:34] <caitp> we need to wrap another existing DOM node, and give it the data and event handlers of the first one
[05:30:59] <limpc> seutje: that doesnt work sorry
[05:31:10] <limpc> im not using draggable
[05:31:53] <seutje> limpc: lol my bad, it's dragstart, not startdrag
[05:31:58] <seutje> and it's native
[05:32:14] <caitp> i want to fix this, but I don't want to break it for people using older versions of jQuery ;_;
[05:32:16] <limpc> that worked :) thanks
[05:32:43] <seutje> caitp: yeah, trying to find a proper way of copying it over, regardless of version
[05:32:55] <caitp> it is much appreciated =)
[05:34:04] <limpc> seutje: hmm whats the dragstop/drop counterpart?
[05:34:19] <limpc> i tried dragend but it doesnt seem to fire
[05:34:22] <Cork> ?mdn dragend
[05:34:29] <b-ot> Cork: dragend - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/dragend
[05:34:30] <Cork> ?mdn dragover
[05:34:34] <b-ot> Cork: :-moz-drag-over - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:-moz-drag-over
[05:34:41] <Cork> ?mdn dragmove
[05:34:43] <b-ot> Cork: nsIDragService - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIDragService
[05:34:44] <limpc> yeah but my dragend doesnt seem to trigger
[05:34:45] <Cork> bah
[05:35:09] <limpc> does calling e.preventDefault() on dragstart prevent dragend from firing?
[05:35:09] <Cork> limpc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/dragend#Related_Events
[05:35:14] <frigginCarebear> limpc: of course
[05:35:44] <limpc> so i guess i need to trap mouseup instead of dragend
[05:37:55] <caitp> hmm you know
[05:38:00] <caitp> I probably don't need the events at all
[05:38:22] <caitp> since the only place they could be added is in the clone function, where they're unlikely to be added. maybe worrying about that can wait
[05:42:51] <seutje> caitp: well, if u only need the stuff added with $.fn.data, u can just use that to retrieve it
[05:43:34] <caitp> i'm going to see if `var data = $element.data(); <<DO REPLACE STUFF>> if ($element.data() !== data) { $element.data(data); }`
[05:43:40] <caitp> but I think that will probably break jqLite :(
[05:43:56] <Cork> that would copy all data over
[05:43:58] <Cork> but not events
[05:44:02] <clearcut> hello guys i need a menu that does things like this one: http://www.sooperthemes.com/sites/default/files/SooperFish/example.html#a - but all i need is a vertical list with menus popping by the side of the list element, i dont need a horizontal menu.
[05:44:05] <caitp> I don't think events should be an issue
[05:44:13] <Cork> caitp: oh, wait
[05:44:15] <Cork> $element.data() !== data won't work
[05:44:30] <caitp> I'm not doing a deep equals, that would be too hurtful
[05:44:34] <Cork> unless you just want to check if it is the exact same object
[05:44:43] <caitp> that is what I want to check :p
[05:44:48] <Cork> caitp: you prob don't need to do anything
[05:44:57] <Cork> cause if you assign the same ref again it would change nothing
[05:45:16] <seutje> clever girl...
[05:45:55] <limpc> hmm in a class method, i have this: GlobalScrollerDragTimer = setTimeout(function() { GlobalsgScrollerControlDragging = false; console.log("stop"); }, 2000);
[05:46:06] <limpc> GlobalScrollerDragTimer is a global var outside of the class
[05:46:07] <xec> is that a jurrasic park reference?
[05:46:13] <seutje> :P
[05:46:22] <limpc> but when i console.log(GlobalScrollerDragTimer), it's null
[05:48:22] <limpc> nm my own stupidity
[05:50:27] <MO_Handes> in lines 17-19 variables d,m,y are set, I want to watch them to know their format, I don't know jquery. how? http://paste.debian.net/75221/
[05:51:53] <Amnesia> question "$("#" + rowID).remove();" is that the correct way to remove a table row?
[05:52:39] <Amnesia> the reason I'm asking, is because, since I'm trying to remove a cloned row using js, the appearche changes
[05:53:03] <Amnesia> appereance *
[05:53:04] <koneko> Amnesia, if it's a cloned row there might be a problem with multiple rows having the same ID
[05:53:30] <Amnesia> koneko: well, I have changed the id of the cloned row using the following line of code: this.id = (rowID + "_clone");
[05:53:37] <koneko> in general, if you had a different ID per row, the code is valid
[05:54:39] <koneko> MO_Handes, do you only want to preview what's the value of these variables after line 19?
[05:55:02] <MO_Handes> koneko, yes
[05:55:07] <Amnesia> koneko: https://privatepaste.com/b38be11261
[05:56:02] <koneko> MO_Handes, console.log(d); after line 19, then (in Chrome) hit F12, go to Console and it will be printed when the code evaluates. You can also make a breakpoint with the JS debugging tools and check local variables when it pauses.
[05:56:03] <Amnesia> might be css related, since I do change the css class of the clone
[05:58:44] <koneko> Amnesia, use this.attr('id', rowID + '_copy'), but also consider the possibility of cloning the row twice, in which case you will end up with two rows with a value of, e.g. 'row2_copy'
[05:59:06] <Amnesia> crap, haven't thought of that
[05:59:10] <koneko> err, $(this).attr('id', rowID + '_copy');
[05:59:52] <koneko> Actually you don't need the each(), so you can just put it all together with attr('id, ...) and .appendTo
[06:00:04] <Amnesia> what exactly is the difference?
[06:01:10] <Amnesia> between attr() and this.id = rowID + '_clone'?
[06:02:33] <koneko> Not much in this case, should work well either way and $(this) might be slower by some mseconds, but if you're modifying the attribute of a DOM element and you're using jQuery anyway to retrieve it, for readability I would use .attr to write the attribute too.
[06:02:57] <koneko> At first I thought this.id could refer to some internal jQuery object ID, but it's a DOM element at that point
[06:03:42] <Amnesia> I see
[06:03:59] <Amnesia> and what about the appereance that's changing?
[06:04:17] <Amnesia> appeariance * -.-
[06:04:43] <koneko> appearance
[06:04:55] <koneko> Well, might be CSS-related - do you use IDs to style the rows?
[06:05:14] <koneko> Should be CSS-related anyway
[06:05:27] <koneko> And you add a form-updated class too, so maybe that's it
[06:05:59] <Amnesia> but that row eventually gets removed:p
[06:06:50] <Amnesia> the class of the original row should change afaik..
[06:07:27] <koneko> Create a jsfiddle, we'll check it out
[06:09:00] <Amnesia> let me google what jsfiddle exactly is:)
[06:10:40] <Amnesia> hm
[06:10:56] <Amnesia> don't think it's really practical to do so, the table's dynamically being created:)
[06:31:01] <limpc> how do i get the mouse's current x/y position on a dragstart event?
[06:31:23] <limpc> dragstart: function(e) { console.log(e.pageX); } is undefined
[06:32:25] <Cork> limpc: clientX/clientY
[06:32:37] <limpc> is that cross browser?
[06:33:35] <limpc> hmm still undefined
[06:33:56] <limpc> this is for the dragstart event not mousemove
[06:34:06] <Cork> not completely sure, but i think so
[06:34:10] <Cork> you would have to test
[06:34:28] <Cork> the drag event isn't a very old one
[06:34:38] <limpc> yea i tested it, it is undefined still
[06:34:39] <Cork> so the ones that support it should have support
[06:37:52] <limpc> figured it out.
[06:38:00] <limpc> its e.originalEvent.pageX
[06:38:34] <Cork> not sure if pageX is cross browser
[06:38:47] <Cork> i think clientX is in the spec
[06:39:14] <limpc> k will try that
[06:39:32] <limpc> works ty
[06:52:12] <emka> Could I simplify this? The each loop
[06:52:12] <emka> http://pastie.org/8617388#2-5
[06:52:29] <emka> can I pick up an array of the attibutes straight away?
[06:53:26] <emka> map
[06:56:36] <emka> hmm.. which one of these is the "best" approach you think? http://pastie.org/8617408
[07:20:10] <computer2000> can anyone help me with checking for imageload for dynamically loaded images? i am changing the src attribute and need to fire an event as soon as the img has loaded
[07:21:34] <xec> myImage.load(func) ?

[07:25:07] <joro> yea
[07:25:08] <xec> computer2000: is the image cached by any chance?
[07:25:19] <computer2000> xec: yes thats possible

[07:45:47] <ElysiumNet> is there any way to submit a form with javascript? I only seem to be getting abort errors in firefox when attempting to do so
[07:52:04] <ElysiumNet> $('form').submit() just will abort the request and reload the current page
[07:56:25] <triven> Hi all , I need help on following topic
[07:56:27] <triven> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/set-slider-value-row-wise
[07:57:31] <triven> Please dont mind its little urgent. I would be very thankful if someone help me quickly:)
[08:00:05] * ElysiumNet is starting to get really miffed at this submit issue
[08:00:14] <ElysiumNet> it's submitting to the same domain, there is no reason for firefox to abort it
[08:03:17] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: Have it up somewhere?
[08:03:50] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: I'm making an isolated version right now
[08:04:02] <BillCriswell> The forums are password protected? Stinks.
[08:04:09] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: Awesome.
[08:06:00] <zulcc> reading the forums is for logged in users only? how does that make any sense...
[08:07:07] <ElysiumNet> what the hell... on my other server it works
[08:10:02] <ElysiumNet> exact same code, exact same library version, and it goes all wonkers
[08:11:36] <hesco> I'm trying to write an event handler on this radio button set: <input name="add_to_list" type="radio" inside a <div class="add_to_list"; and this does not seem to be working for me:  $('div.list_options.input.add_to_list').toggle();  How do I address that radio button set in a selector, please?
[08:12:04] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: At least you narrowed down the issue!
[08:12:25] <hesco> sorry, make that <div class="list_options"
[08:12:30] <BillCriswell> hesco: Ah.
[08:12:45] <BillCriswell> hesco: $('.list_options .add_to_list').toggle() would be plenty.
[08:12:51] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: that doesn't help me as it's still failing on the server even when isolating it
[08:13:00] <BillCriswell> Unless you have elements of different types with the same class.
[08:13:13] <hesco> BillCriswell:  thanks, trying that.
[08:13:35] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: What does the network tab say when you submit it?
[08:13:47] <ElysiumNet> Abborted
[08:14:43] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: Hmmm
[08:15:04] <BillCriswell> Is the serer giving you the right content type?
[08:15:21] <ElysiumNet> it's not even trying to send anything
[08:15:38] <ElysiumNet> there are no requests in the serverlog
[08:17:34] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: You said it works on a different server, right?
[08:17:51] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: yes, the one I locally host, my development server
[08:17:58] <ElysiumNet> on the production server it won't even send the request
[08:18:00] <i-node> hello
[08:18:35] <ElysiumNet> also the production server is significantly slower, so I should be seeing it load at least for several seconds rather than immediately returning aborted
[08:21:33] <i-node> I'm sending a form data to a php file through jquery and ajax and want the return html to be placed in a div using .get() , but something is going wrong, because it reloads the entire page. here is the code http://pastebin.com/iKuZMiqf
[08:22:15] <ElysiumNet> ....
[08:22:20] * ElysiumNet punches the production server
[08:22:26] <ElysiumNet> AND firefox
[08:22:32] <ElysiumNet> it cached the internal server page
[08:24:00] <BillCriswell> i-node: You need to preventDefault.
[08:24:15] <i-node> BillCriswell: do you mean return false;?
[08:24:24] <BillCriswell> Replace $('#form1').submit( function() { with $('#form1').submit( function(e) { and on the next line do e.preventDefault();
[08:24:42] <BillCriswell> i-node: That would work, but differently.
[08:24:59] <i-node> BillCriswell: I tried return false but it still doesn't work. i'll try yours
[08:25:01] <i-node> thanks
[08:26:50] <i-node> BillCriswell: is that what you're saying? it reloads the page too http://pastebin.com/gcGB3Jna
[08:28:28] <i-node> BillCriswell: well, I forgot to delete the return false line, because now it's not needed, but there's something bad
[08:31:42] <WrinkledCheese> I'm having issues trying to insert an h2 element after an element with an ID.  IE $('#elementId').after($('h2').text('some text')); Should work, correct?
[08:31:42] <WrinkledCheese> Or $('h2').text('some text').insertAfter('#elementId'); or $('h2').text('some text').insertAfter($('#elementId'));
[08:33:11] <WrinkledCheese> Any ideas?
[08:33:19] <i-node> WrinkledCheese: try with nth-child
[08:33:21] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: this just keeps getting weirder
[08:33:31] <WrinkledCheese> nth-child?
[08:33:41] <ElysiumNet> in the firefox browser I receive a 500 internal server error, when doing the exact same request with cURL, it just works
[08:33:49] <WrinkledCheese> IE [0] after the closing parenthesis on the sector for #elementId
[08:33:51] <i-node> WrinkledCheese: http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[08:36:56] <WrinkledCheese> So you're saying replace selector '#elementId' with '#elementId:nth-selector(1)'

[08:37:14] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: what content-type header is usually sent when submitting a form?
[08:37:42] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: I am really not sure.
[08:38:01] <ElysiumNet> because curl fails when the content-type is text/plain; charset=utf-8
[08:38:09] <ElysiumNet> which is what the browser sends
[08:39:47] <ElysiumNet> yeah, it's supposed to send application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[08:39:49] <WrinkledCheese> :nth-child(1) makes no difference.
[08:43:45] <WrinkledCheese> My selector is working fine.  I can console.log($('#elementId')); and console.log($('h2').text('some text')); without any issues.
[08:45:48] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: I think I better stop chasing this rabbithole before I go insane
[08:46:07] <ElysiumNet> submitting the form in the same window = internal server error received by the browser. submitting the form and opening it in a new window, works as it should
[08:48:30] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: It is weird.
[08:48:45] <ElysiumNet> it makes no sense
[08:49:20] <ElysiumNet> it also sends the correct content-type header now, which it didn't before
[08:50:19] <WrinkledCheese> Have you checked the "internal server" error log?  IE Default error log for Apache on Linux is /var/log/httpd/error-log and on FreeBSD /var/log/httpd-error.log
[08:50:49] <WrinkledCheese> ElysiumNet: ^
[08:51:06] <ElysiumNet> WrinkledCheese: I'm currently waiting for the results of that
[08:51:16] <ElysiumNet> the sysadmin doesn't want me to tail it
[08:51:19] <WrinkledCheese> Have you tried ctrl+shift+r
[08:51:30] <ElysiumNet> so he's sending the whole 5GB file to my email account instead -_-
[08:51:44] <WrinkledCheese> He's handicapped?  that will never work
[08:52:03] <WrinkledCheese> 5GB files tend to not pass email file size limitations
[08:52:58] <WrinkledCheese> Your error is going to tell you what error the server encountered and should shed light on the issue you're having.
[08:54:34] <ElysiumNet> WrinkledCheese: I know
[08:55:18] <ElysiumNet> the guy has a couple of cisco and windows certificates, hence why he's in charge of operating the linux production server
[09:05:48] <BillCriswell> Man, something seems very wrong with the way IE11 is approaching touch events.
[09:08:34] <WrinkledCheese> BillCriswell: We currently don't support IE
[09:09:11] <WrinkledCheese> Because thy're going of in their own direction again.  Implementing things as they suggest them for the next generation specifications....
[09:09:27] <WrinkledCheese> They break backwards compatibility
[09:10:31] <BillCriswell> WrinkledCheese: It's crazy.
[09:14:59] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[09:16:25] <BillCriswell> -ms-scroll-snap-points-x blah
[09:17:34] <BillCriswell> Can't wait till touch stuff is a little easier to work with all throughout. I feel like everything currently is just a hack job.
[09:18:14] <NoiseEee> what a drag BillCriswell
[09:18:20] <NoiseEee> thought they were supposedly coming around
[09:19:29] <fabioportieri> why the fuck ie keep screwing standards?
[09:19:48] <fabioportieri> i don't get it
[09:20:32] <NoiseEee> same reason everyone screws standards, i mean, chrome/google do whatever fuck they want
[09:20:39] <NoiseEee> they want to move ahead with innovation
[09:21:06] <fabioportieri> chrome is becoming more and more buggy...
[09:21:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah, Chrome has been kind of a dick lately.
[09:22:03] <BillCriswell> A giant touch screen is so fun but I feel like nothing works as naturally as it should web wise.
[09:25:02] <BillCriswell> I always feel like Chrome goes through a rough patch then eventually smooths itself out.
[09:25:19] <BillCriswell> It's ability to smooth itself out with auto updates is what lets it get away with a lot more haha
[09:33:55] <interop_madness> i have problems with sporadically aborted $.ajax() requests (according to firebug). the problem persists across different browsers. a certain request would sometimes be aborted after about 10 ms. there is no direct call with XmlHttpRequest, as far as i can see.
[09:35:19] <interop_madness> the aborted request however happens roughly within the same timeframe as a request for a png file which is referenced by a css file
[09:35:37] <duch_kazatel> interop_madness could you share your code at all?
[09:36:13] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, it's next to impossible i'm afraid
[09:36:45] <interop_madness> it's a whole framework with hundreds of files and it wouldn't work without installing the server-side either
[09:37:05] <duch_kazatel> interop_madness is your question about $.ajax(), or is it about something else?
[09:37:22] <duch_kazatel> can you share just the jquery $.ajax() code at all?
[09:37:24] <interop_madness> but the request is pretty straightforward: $.ajax() with data, success-, error- and always-handler
[09:39:16] <duch_kazatel> so something is causing the request to abort - have you tried doing the request outside of the ajax call?
[09:39:28] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, the request is inside ajax-solr and is pretty straightforward: see http://pastie.org/8617955
[09:40:07] <duch_kazatel> have you tried copy/pasting the request URL into a separate browser window and making sure that still works?
[09:41:29] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, yes i have tried and it works
[09:42:12] <interop_madness> the fact that firebug shows the request as aborted and jqXhr.status === 0 (also statustext === "") indicates that the request never reaches the server
[09:42:47] <duch_kazatel> what about statusCode?
[09:42:52] <interop_madness> would it also be shown as aborted if some network device between my box and the server dropped the packet?
[09:43:38] <duch_kazatel> erm, if it works in a browser tab and breaks in your code...
[09:44:23] <duch_kazatel> something in your code is canceling the request.  that's why you're getting that.
[09:44:44] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, jqXHR.statusCode is a function. executing it in the debug watch somehow yields the jqXHR itself
[09:45:34] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, i thought as much. so i placed breakpoints on XmlHttpRequest.abort() inside jquery.js. it is never hit.
[09:45:54] <duch_kazatel> interop_madness you need to look through your own codebase.
[09:45:57] <coderhut> Hi, how can I show/hide a multiselect dropdown that I built using jquery plugin www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget ?
[09:46:15] <duch_kazatel> i very much doubt jquery is at fault.
[09:46:30] <interop_madness> duch_kazatel, there is no direct use of XmlHttpRequest and there is no abort call anywhere
[09:46:48] <duch_kazatel> then I dunno what to tell you.
[09:47:10] <interop_madness> and AFAIK $.ajax() accounts for "parallel" calls i.e. one doesn't cancel the other
[09:48:04] <interop_madness> is there a way to break when an XmlHttpRequest is aborted?
[09:49:25] <itsed_> $.html() seems to be changing the actual html of the element... is there a way to avoid that?
[09:49:46] <duch_kazatel> interop_madness sure - watch for the event.
[09:49:51] <duch_kazatel> should should work.
[09:50:01] <duch_kazatel> and itsed_ what do you expect it to do otherwise?
[09:50:43] <itsed_> duch_kazatel just realized that was vague - writting up a fiddle now
[09:51:57] <coderhut> Hi, how can I show/hide a multiselect dropdown that I built using jquery plugin www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget ?
[09:52:47] <duch_kazatel> coderhut your question doesn't really make sense.  you could do this: $('selectorHere').hide();
[09:53:17] <coderhut> well I tried using this but it really isn't working
[09:53:28] <fabioportieri> well paste your attempt
[09:54:11] <itsed_> http://jsfiddle.net/yHdez/ -- the html logged to the console is not the actual html of the node.  is there a way to get the actual html contained in the node?
[09:54:39] <duch_kazatel> isted_ you're getting the rendered markup
[09:54:58] <itsed_> is there a way to get the "unrendered" markup?
[09:55:53] <itsed_> what is being logged has the "invalid html" stripped and has a <tbody/> tag added...
[09:56:12] <coderhut> fabiopotieri and duch_kazatel : http://pastie.org/8617992 here is what i tried
[09:56:21] <duch_kazatel> itsed_ correct.  the browser is "fixing" your markup.  you're technically supposed to use a tbody tag inside your tabole.
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> *table
[09:56:31] <duch_kazatel> not sure how to get the "undrendered" markup actually.
[09:56:51] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I leave
[09:56:52] <shoky> $.ajax
[09:56:52] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[09:58:53] <coderhut> fabiopotieri: http://pastie.org/8617992 here is what i tried
[10:07:09] <fabioportieri> coderhut: that's not very helpful, try to put up a testcase in jsfiddle
[10:08:08] <fabioportieri> i assume #property_style_Income is the id of the container element for your multiselect?
[10:21:23] <fabioportieri> even today almost 11 hours.. groan
[10:38:58] <bberry> Hey guys, im using the jstree library.  I dont know how to use its api.  i am trying to use get_selected().  I have tried stuff like $.jstree.get_selected() and it doesnt work. Heres the api page. http://www.jstree.com/api#
[10:39:33] <bberry> i just simply dont know how to call the function :/
[10:52:22] <sunbeam> is it possible to have text gradients with CSS?
[11:27:08] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Canvas maybe
[11:29:48] <andrew_r> does anyone know of any bugs that might cause IE8 to not download the full content of an ajax request?
[11:38:25] <tokumei> fadeOut/fadeIn in 1.9.1 is only blinking for me on the latest Chromium for Linux and Google Chrome for Windows, it's working as intended in FF and IE.  I'm basically just using: $("#area").fadeOut, omitting the time argument with a completion function.  Any ideas what might be going on?
[11:42:46] <AlexR2> tokumei: can you show some of your code?
[11:44:17] <mentoc> while in a .each() loop, is it possibly to stop it from iterating?
[11:44:45] <mentoc> bah
[11:44:46] <mentoc> nevermind
[11:44:51] <mentoc> answer is : return false
[11:45:38] <AlexR2> glad we could help
[11:46:09] <tokumei> AlexR2:  Just the relevant bits here: http://ideone.com/c2uOFe, I can reproduce it with this. I'm just sending an ajax get request in the oncomplete function, and fading in the text after I get it
[11:46:22] <tokumei> But it blinks both times
[11:47:42] <AlexR2> I assume it's because you have something in your code afterwards that affects the styles on the div
[11:48:00] <AlexR2> http://jsfiddle.net/42DYh/ works properly
[11:49:22] <AlexR2> Without more I can't tell what it might be
[12:16:02] <quansai> hey, guys
[12:16:32] <AlexR2> hi
[12:22:53] <quansai> I'm using .get() to load a page. The page redirects me to another page, so 'response' the callback method for 'success:' contains html as text for the final destination reached by accessing the original 'url:'.  I need the url of the final location jquery ends up with after it's redirected.
[12:23:07] <quansai> Any ideas on how to get the url of the destination page?
[12:24:08] <quansai> I tried getting the headers using XMLHttp. I can only seem to get the header of the destination page of the original url.
[12:24:33] <quansai> So that header doesn't contain 'Location'.
[12:25:20] <AlexR2> quansai: show some code please
[12:25:24] <quansai> Sure.
[12:25:47] <bowenac> im trying to animate an append using this img.appendTo('#appended').show('slow'); but the animate has no effect its just instantly there any ideas?
[12:26:20] <NoiseEee> bowenac: make sure #appended is a hidden thing first
[12:26:28] <NoiseEee> or img
[12:26:56] <bowenac> that is the div the image is being appended to
[12:28:32] <AlexR2> bowenac: you may need to add it to the dom before calling append, i'm not sure
[12:28:40] <AlexR2> not chain them i mean
[12:29:20] <AlexR2> wow let me rewrite that, that was horrible  you may need to append it to the dom and call show after it's been appended without chaining it
[12:43:24] <quansai> XMLHttpRequest transparently follows a redirect. Is there any way I can get the location of the redirection before the actual redirect?
[12:45:58] <AlexR2> quansai: Try using a regular ajax request instead of a $.get
[12:47:03] <Xzeion> I want to get a small page up and running that auto refreshes the data it finds in an xml file.
[12:47:59] <Xzeion> i have the basic idea down but it does things i dont want it to and would like to make the simplest version of it as possible
[12:48:15] <bowenac> AlexR2 you still around?
[12:48:27] <sifu_> hmmm could anyone tell me what am i doing wrong here...in the fiddle the text does not appear but on the example it does...and i have simply copied the example to the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sifu/JHFFg/ -----> example used: http://www.armagost.com/zaccordion/another-advanced-example/
[12:48:52] <quansai> AlexR2: I'm using CrossRider.
[12:49:28] <AlexR2> bowenac: yes
[12:49:52] <bowenac> here is a fiddle where it kind of works but when you check another one it hides them both and then shows them both haha
[12:49:59] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/GL2UC/
[12:51:31] <AlexR2> bowenac: you need to preload the images
[12:52:11] <AlexR2> $('#selectedOptions img').hide(); will select all images
[12:52:23] <bowenac> how would I preload the images when the images are based on which checkbox is checked

[12:54:04] <LordThumper> Hi I am writing a plugin using $.plugin = function () { }
[12:54:18] <LordThumper> Is it possible to set $.plugin.property from inside the function ?
[12:54:28] <Xzeion> is anyone willing to tutor me in making a basic page that can auto refresh data from an xml file using ajax?
[12:54:32] <LordThumper> This is a generic javascript question
[12:55:02] <bowenac> ic thanks
[12:55:32] <AlexR2> LordThumper: have you tried just doing it?
[12:56:04] <LordThumper> window.a = (function () { window.a.aaa = 123; return function (a) { console.log(a); }; })()
[12:56:07] <LordThumper> That does not seem to work
[12:56:51] <Xzeion> I have 2 scrips here http://bpaste.net/show/srfzdRBij3VdE86hUJQ8/
[12:57:00] <Xzeion> they work on my laptop
[12:57:38] <Xzeion> or local server, what might prevent them from working on a second computers local page
[12:59:51] <AlexR2> LordThumper: technically yes, you can update the property from inside the function.  You do need to have it defined first though.
[13:00:10] <AlexR2> In your example you're updating window.a.aaa (updating "window.a") before it is set
[13:01:14] <Xzeion> am i being ignored because my questions are too general? or because nobody knows ? I am new to irc channels so i am trying to figure out irc manners still
[13:01:35] <LordThumper> AlexR2: Ok im kinda confused
[13:01:39] <AlexR2> `ajax @ Xzeion
[13:01:40] <LordThumper> Can a function have properties?
[13:01:49] <LordThumper> As in $.fn in a function
[13:01:55] <LordThumper> And $.fn.foo is a property
[13:02:07] <AlexR2> `api ajax @ Xzeion
[13:02:13] <AlexR2> blah bot! work!
[13:02:25] <AlexR2> LordThumper: yes it can
[13:02:34] <Xzeion> AlexR2: huh?
[13:02:36] <AlexR2> but you can't set $.fn.foo until you already have $.fn set to something
[13:02:46] <AlexR2> Xzeion: api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:02:53] <AlexR2> read over that
[13:02:57] <Xzeion> ok
[13:05:09] <AlexR2> jquery will wrap all the http request stuff in nice wrappers to make it easier to work with
[13:05:43] <LordThumper> AlexR2: This isnt working either
[13:05:43] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/cWdz2/
[13:14:51] <AlexR2> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/cWdz2/3/
[13:15:08] <AlexR2> "this" inside there refers to query, not $.a
[13:16:27] <cortexman> does jquery-ui rely on some images?

[13:24:17] <X5-> Okay guys, I'm using a jquery plugin on my website called 'owl carousel'. When I move the site to a live server for some reason it doesn't work with Firefox.
[13:24:23] <X5-> But it works fine with Google Chrome
[13:26:15] <X5-> Any ideas?
[13:34:54] <limpc> hey.  I built a 3 layer parallax carousel for a client.  all 3 rows contain useful data targeting end users. The client wants to be able to view data on any layer by having that block brought to the top of the pile on mouseover.  I'm using li elements as containers though, and cant for the life of me figure out how to do this
[13:35:39] <limpc> i cant change the z-index order of the entire ul element. they want just the one block coming to the front. any ideas how this can be done?
[13:44:29] <limpc> *crickets chirping*
[13:46:27] <duch_kazatel> welcome to #jquery
[13:47:55] <andrew_r> what happens when you try to change the z-index of the li?
[13:48:39] <andrew_r> your question might be better for #css
[13:48:48] <Cork> limpc: should work just find if you set position: relative; on the li
[13:49:01] <Cork> *fine
[13:51:43] <sifu_> In the fiddle the text does not appear but on the example it does...and i have simply copied the example to the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sifu/JHFFg/ -----> example used: http://www.armagost.com/zaccordion/another-advanced-example/ ... can't figure out why
[13:53:15] <quansai> Can I call post() inside of get() when get() is successful?
[13:53:50] <NoiseEee> quansai: you can make another xhr call, if thats what you're asking...
[13:53:52] <Cork> sifu_: change the height css for #slider2
[13:53:57] <duch_kazatel> quansai you can add a success callback.
[14:00:42] <sifu_> Cork sorry was away for a bit...will do thank you
[14:04:56] <sifu_> hmm changed the height still no tengo
[14:15:55] <zygfryd`> hi, I have problem, I've two window, parent and popup, on pop-up is link who change location of this pop-up. Can I bind on parent function who execute on pop-up change location ?
[14:19:18] <duch_kazatel> zygfryd` i'd start with something like this - http://anishantha87.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-run-function-of-parent-window.html
[14:31:16] <trisox> bazinga!!
[14:35:42] <icemancast> quick question i am doing a jsonp call and seems to work
[14:35:48] <icemancast> except server sends back json
[14:35:55] <icemancast> which results in an error
[14:36:04] <duch_kazatel> icemancast is the server setup for jsonp?
[14:36:28] <icemancast> after researching I know you can wrap ( {} ) in parenthesis
[14:36:32] <icemancast> not sure
[14:36:39] <icemancast> it returns data to me
[14:36:42] <icemancast> but in an error
[14:37:05] <duch_kazatel> icemancast the response should be wrapped in a callback.
[14:37:07] <duch_kazatel> that's the entire point.
[14:37:19] <zygfryd`> sorry, my computer hangup, who give me this link: http://anishantha87.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-run-function-of-parent-window.html
[14:37:28] <Cork> icemancast: jsonp is a hack
[14:37:32] <duch_kazatel> zygfryd` I did.
[14:37:38] <duch_kazatel> a Cork wat O.o
[14:37:51] <Cork> it sends the json in a script file just to work around the xss block
[14:37:59] <icemancast> i know there wasn't way around it cause of cross site
[14:38:02] <icemancast> i do
[14:38:15] <zygfryd`> duch_kazatel: your is ok, but I have to bind on parent side, not change child html
[14:38:18] <duch_kazatel> icemancast it's to get around of cross site issues.
[14:38:22] <icemancast> $.getJson('url&callback=?', function)
[14:38:37] <zygfryd`> duch_kazatel: s/your is ok/your code
[14:38:38] <Cork> will only work if the serer actually use the callback value
[14:38:42] <Cork> icemancast: 
[14:38:45] <Cork> *^
[14:38:50] <duch_kazatel> zygfryd` that's not my code.
[14:38:55] <duch_kazatel> zygfryd` i was pointing you in a direction.
[14:39:04] <icemancast> no well to tell that unless they have told me correct?
[14:39:09] <icemancast> or documented it
[14:39:30] <duch_kazatel> why not just use standard json instead?
[14:39:33] <Cork> icemancast: if the server sends you json back, it most likely doesn't support it
[14:39:55] <Cork> icemancast: but cors might fix it for none ie browsers
[14:39:57] <icemancast> i get unexpected token :
[14:40:02] <Cork> if the server is configured for that
[14:40:09] <Cork> icemancast: ya, cause you get json not js
[14:40:37] <zygfryd`> duch_kazatel: yes, I now this idea, but I must have lisner/bind on parent site
[14:40:48] <icemancast> gotcha
[14:40:50] <icemancast> thanks
[14:40:51] <Cork> jsonp is random_function_name({ json goes here })
[14:41:06] <trisox> hey cork
[14:41:13] <icemancast> yeah console shows me json
[14:41:16] <icemancast> but no callback
[14:41:20] <icemancast> so they prob don't
[14:41:30] <Cork> icemancast: check if you have a cors header in the response
[14:41:48] <Cork> trisox: o/
[14:41:54] <trisox> ]
[14:42:00] <trisox> hey o/
[14:42:03] <icemancast> no cors
[14:42:04] <duch_kazatel> zygfryd` http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17095607/call-javascript-of-parent-window-from-child-window
[14:42:06] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[14:42:06] <icemancast> just json data
[14:42:30] <trisox> been long time cork
[14:42:32] <Cork> icemancast: then the only option; if you can't modify the server config is to proxy it over your own server
[14:42:42] <Cork> trisox: ya
[14:43:18] <icemancast> gotcha
[14:43:19] <icemancast> thanks!
[14:43:20] <trisox> ah well think of coming around more often
[14:43:41] <trisox> now looking for good irc client for osx
[14:43:55] <icemancast> i use colloquy
[14:43:57] <Cork> trisox: hexchat
[14:43:59] <icemancast> like it
[14:44:04] <Cork> ?g hexchat
[14:44:08] <Cork> crossplatform
[14:44:16] <Cork> <_<
[14:44:20] <Cork> the bot is down?
[14:44:25] <trisox> k
[14:44:35] <Cork> http://hexchat.github.io/
[14:44:36] <duch_kazatel> `g hexchat
[14:44:43] <duch_kazatel> pfft.  lame.
[14:44:43] <Cork> anyway
[14:44:49] <Cork> it is a clone of xchat
[14:44:51] <trisox> no osx :(
[14:45:28] <Cork> hmm was osx in planing...
[14:45:34] <Cork> might have remembered wrone
[14:45:38] <Cork> *wrong
[14:46:11] <icemancast> trisox: i use http://colloquy.info/
[14:46:40] <Cork> hmm weird
[14:46:44] <Cork> they state mac support...
[14:47:31] <Cork> ah
[14:47:38] <Cork> no binaries
[14:47:46] <Cork> it is supported though https://github.com/HexChat/hexchat
[14:48:08] <trisox> colloquy  it is
[14:48:10] <Cork> trisox: check the app store (or what osx has), might be in there
[14:48:23] <trisox> all payed or sucky cork
[14:48:34] <Cork> i mean hexchat
[14:48:51] <Cork> but ya i know close to nothing about mac
[14:49:03] <trisox> hehe D
[14:49:40] <Cork> i run it for a few min a week on average (for safari and i* testing)
[14:49:54] <frem> limechat is decent on os x. textual (paid) is also good.
[14:51:16] <Trisox> well
[14:51:31] <Trisox> this works :)
[14:52:12] <Trisox> Cork: i only work on windows once a week or so
[14:52:52] <Cork> Trisox: i basically only game on windows
[14:53:04] <Cork> so < then osx
[14:53:50] <Trisox> me 2 :D
[14:53:55] <frem> ah, hexchat is on os x via homebrew.
[14:54:10] <Trisox> colloquy works fine
[14:54:35] <Trisox> i used http://conceited.net/products/linkinus once pretty nice
[14:54:50] <Trisox> only bit expensive for a irc client if you ask me
[14:55:23] <jphase> i use limechat for mac - it's free and simple and looks like sublime text :]
[14:55:43] <X5-> Why is load balancing important in web development?
[14:56:04] <jphase> to handle heavy traffic
[14:56:25] <Trisox> jphase: thats hard if you use sublime text as a editor you will be typing code in your irc client before you know it
[14:56:26] <Trisox> haha
[14:56:36] <jphase> hah, touché
[14:56:39] <Trisox> :D
[14:56:47] <jphase> I luckily run them on two different monitors
[14:57:20] <Trisox> jphase: indeed
[14:57:43] <X5-> Ooh.. But how though?
[14:58:08] <X5-> If your using something like godaddy to host your website, how would it be done?
[14:58:20] <jphase> well ... it wouldn't cause godaddy kinda blows
[14:58:21] <Trisox> don't think you can
[14:58:29] <Trisox> wy not go cloud ?
[14:58:39] <jphase> I use load balancers for client sites that use Rackspace for their host
[14:58:40] <Trisox> got balancer options in there
[14:58:45] <jphase> they offer scalable awesomeness with load balancing
[14:59:01] <Trisox> jphase: amazone and azure also
[14:59:06] <jphase> yesm, amazon is nice
[14:59:23] <Trisox> azure not bad either
[14:59:29] <X5-> Amazon web services?
[14:59:32] <jphase> haven't used before
[14:59:33] <jphase> yeah
[14:59:47] <jphase> amazon s3, ec2, all their lil' prefixes are good
[14:59:48] <Trisox> you can scale up when you need more processing power ect
[15:00:05] <Trisox> if your season based webshop for example
[15:00:32] <Trisox> if you got loads of load you can scale up and down when needed only pay for what you use
[15:00:46] <jphase> yeah I run a server for a marathon and during registration (once a year) it has huge spikes in traffic - good use for a load balancer
[15:01:06] <Trisox> jphase:
[15:01:06] <Trisox> indeed
[15:01:25] <Trisox> at work i have a client who has 2 month spikes
[15:01:38] <Trisox> then its quiet
[15:01:42] <Trisox> basicly
[15:02:09] <Trisox> like 30% of all books for schools are rented and sold there
[15:02:15] <Trisox> in the netherlands
[15:03:18] <X5-> You guys are truly genius's
[15:03:24] <X5-> And I'm a fail, aha xD
[15:03:46] <jphase> nah, some people just never have a use for clustering or load balancing, doesn't make 'em any less smart :)
[15:03:48] <Trisox> no its just experience
[15:04:01] <Trisox> jphase: what he said
[15:04:47] <Trisox> men been a while since i last used jquery
[15:05:12] <jphase> *room goes quiet*    "NEW YORK CITY!?!?!"
[15:05:27] <jphase> (pace sals commercial)
[15:05:31] <jphase> salsa even
[15:06:30] <hesco> could I get some help please on my first attempt with jquery?  https://gist.github.com/hesco/d6ae190b6ac397946395  I want it to hide and show divs as the radio buttons are toggled.  Can anyone help me on this please?
[15:06:52] <jphase> hesco: put that into jsfiddle.net and we'll help ya out
[15:07:45] <X5-> I had a question before but no-one answered it
[15:07:48] <X5-> May I ask again?
[15:07:51] <mentoc> jphase: that commercial was from the 90s
[15:07:54] <jphase> sure
[15:08:00] * jphase dates himself :[
[15:08:16] <X5-> I'm using a jquery plugin on my website called 'owl carousel'. When I move the site to a live server for some reason it doesn't work with Firefox.
[15:08:19] <X5-> It works fine with Chrome
[15:08:43] <X5-> Any ideas?
[15:08:46] <jphase> X5-: I'm not really familiar with that plugin, do you have a live URL we can see?
[15:09:43] <X5-> Sure thing, Just give me 2 seconds
[15:10:17] <Trisox> owl carousel' is pretty cool
[15:10:22] <Trisox> reponsive carousel
[15:11:55] <X5-> Sorry about the wait
[15:11:59] <X5-> Here: http://tahmidtestserver.host22.com/
[15:12:17] <X5-> Owl Carousel should appear under, "Guys over at #jquery, below this div should be 'Owl Carousel'"
[15:12:28] <X5-> On Firefox it doesn't but on Chrome it does
[15:13:55] <hesco> jphase:  thanks for the help.  looks like a nice tool.  Here you go:  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uNPPrD8e6K
[15:14:29] <jphase> hesco: one sec, just helping X5- debug this firefox oddity
[15:14:35] <Trisox> X5-: http://tahmidtestserver.host22.com/js%5Cowl-carousel%5Cowl.carousel.js
[15:14:38] <hesco> sure, thanks
[15:14:45] <X5-> jphase does it happen to you on Firefox too?
[15:14:51] <Trisox> remove spaces
[15:14:52] <jphase> yes
[15:16:15] <X5-> Link doesn't work, @Trisox
[15:16:22] <Trisox> no
[15:16:24] <Trisox> thats your link
[15:16:25] <Trisox> :)
[15:16:43] <Trisox> look at your source
[15:16:59] <Trisox> it can't load owl carousel function
[15:17:02] <jphase> X5-: says .owlCarousel is not a function - try removing the , after autoPlay : 3000
[15:17:19] <Trisox> jphase: script is not loaded propery in firefox
[15:17:21] <jphase> I think ff doesn't care about those
[15:17:23] <jphase> oh
[15:17:37] <jphase> what Trisox said ^ lol
[15:17:48] <Trisox> how would you guys and girls do this http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Kvaqy i want to run alertsomething() function on click
[15:17:56] <X5-> I have no idea what you guys are talking about..
[15:17:59] <X5-> Is there a fix?
[15:18:12] <Trisox> X5-:  remove spaces in the js file
[15:18:44] <Trisox> oh wait
[15:18:45] <Trisox> <script src="js\owl-carousel\owl.carousel.js"></script>
[15:18:46] <jphase> no
[15:18:52] <jphase> that'll do it
[15:18:54] <Trisox> <script src="js/owl-carousel/owl.carousel.js"></script>
[15:19:29] <jphase> also - remove the line above your <!doctype html> tag too - just cause that'll break IE - like everything else
[15:19:31] <scoT_T> Trisox: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mLwGI
[15:19:32] <scoT_T> ?
[15:19:39] <duch_kazatel> Trisox http://codepen.io/anon/pen/lgmdt
[15:20:28] <Trisox> right
[15:20:32] <jphase> hesco: I'm in there now
[15:20:41] <Trisox> tried it in console didn't work ... haha
[15:21:17] <Trisox> i got ReferenceError: runTime is not defined
[15:21:18] <hesco> hey man, thanks for your help
[15:21:29] <Trisox> in chrome and firefox ..
[15:21:30] <jphase> sure, open up the chat on the right
[15:22:33] <Trisox> well stupid for me !
[15:22:39] <Trisox> thnx scoT_T  and duch_kazatel
[15:25:08] <scoT_T> Trisox: Were you using the console while on CodePen or something local?
[15:25:20] <Trisox> no localy
[15:25:56] <scoT_T> try it like this then, one sec
[15:27:01] <Trisox> scoT_T: oke
[15:27:12] <scoT_T> Trisox: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mLwGI
[15:27:49] <Trisox> thats the same right?
[15:27:53] <scoT_T> nope
[15:27:58] <X5-> Ooh, Thanks jphase! It worked!
[15:28:14] <X5-> Needed to remove the ','
[15:28:16] <jphase> k
[15:28:18] <jphase> sweet
[15:28:21] <X5-> One comma, LOL
[15:28:25] <Trisox> hehe :)
[15:28:26] <X5-> Omg =/
[15:28:34] <X5-> That one comma makes such of a difference
[15:28:47] <X5-> *feels like a noob*
[15:28:52] <Trisox> scoT_T: whats the diverence
[15:29:11] <Trisox> the dom ready ?
[15:29:46] <Trisox> i got that in my script already ;)
[15:29:56] <Trisox> thnx for looking :)
[15:30:33] <Trisox> jphase: autoPlay : 3000, ahaah indeed
[15:30:43] <scoT_T> No trisox, sorry - I'm @ work so have to look back and forward
[15:30:47] <Trisox> also weird // \\ mixed ints
[15:30:54] <Trisox> scoT_T: np :)
[15:31:12] <scoT_T> Trisox: you're moving the runTime declaration into the global scope
[15:31:19] <scoT_T> rather than in the onload
[15:31:51] <Trisox> in the example did it like that indeed :)
[15:32:20] <scoT_T> sorry?
[15:32:42] <Trisox> it was a small snippet
[15:33:23] <scoT_T> Trisox: in your intial example, your onload shorthand $(function() { ... }); wraps the var runTime = { ... };
[15:34:16] <scoT_T> in my last paste, i have moved it into the global, you will be able to access runTime from js console (ff, chrome)
[15:34:17] <Trisox> scoT_T: true
[15:44:12] <Trisox> cu guys time for bed!
[15:44:20] <Trisox> thnx scoT_T :)
[15:44:38] <Trisox> jphase: and Cork cu
[15:44:48] <jphase> ciao Trisox ;)
[15:44:55] <Trisox> have a nice one!
[15:50:33] <hesco> thanks jphase, that was very helpful.
[15:50:40] <jphase> sure thing
[16:13:53] <Gnewt> Is there any way I can run a GET request and then use jQuery to access elements of the DOM of its result?
[16:14:29] <Gnewt> So on example1.com to a GET of example2.com and then extract some data from a table on example2.com
[16:15:07] <Gnewt> I'm guessing I would use parseHtml and a non-default document object
[16:17:22] <coldhead> Ir1sh: are you THE Paul Irish?
[16:36:08] <vinex08> yoh guys, still learning jquery.. im still at beginner level. why dont you give me a test?
[16:44:11] <uskerine> hi, I would like to understand how could I add a mouseenter event to a set of dynamically created objects. For a set of 10 items created in a loop, no matter what I do, values seem to be stuck at the latest value.  Fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/y72rS/1/  As you can see no matter in which item you mouseenter, you get "x11y11" as value
[17:22:13] <terrycojones> uskerine: calculate the strings 'x'+x.toString() and 'y'+y.toString() before you call mouseenter (i.e., on line 40).
[17:22:27] <uskerine> ok i will try that
[17:23:25] <terrycojones> uskerine: the functions you pass to mouseenter all keep a reference to the x and y variables. by the time they're run, your double loop is finished and x and y both are 11.
[17:25:11] <Roundaround> uskerine: actually, it may just be better to use $(this).attr('x') and $(this).attr('y') in place of x and y in your mouseenter handler
[17:25:40] <Roundaround> as in for instance, 'x' + $(this).attr('x')
[17:26:26] <uskerine> i am trying that
[17:26:43] <Roundaround> http://jsfiddle.net/y72rS/1/
[17:26:52] <Sal> hi, how can i get the src of the current script tag?
[17:27:36] <duch_kazatel> Sal clarify?
[17:27:44] <duch_kazatel> sal have an example to illustrate the question?
[17:28:20] <Sal> <script src="/mysubsite/public/js/coincatalog.js"></script>
[17:28:28] <Sal> thats the script that includes the script
[17:28:45] <Sal> from conicatalog.js, how can i read that src attribute of the script tag
[17:29:10] <duch_kazatel> Sal http://davidwalsh.name/script-tag
[17:29:12] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[17:29:31] <duch_kazatel> that might not work depending on your case though.
[17:30:32] <Sal> duch_kazatel, that sample requires me to know the number of script tags on the page
[17:31:16] <duch_kazatel> Sal or to put an attribute on the tag.
[17:31:59] <uskerine> Rpundaround I tried that, but it does not work
[17:32:06] <Sal> can it be done filtering the src?
[17:32:10] <Sal> finding part of it?
[17:32:19] <Sal> so every script searches its own name?
[17:32:54] <duch_kazatel> Sal that would involve some iteration - not sure why you'd need that either way.
[17:32:57] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/At2dM/

[17:37:34] <k_sze[work]> I'm looking for examples of animated, expandable lists using jQuery/jQuery UI
[17:38:03] <k_sze[work]> The kind where you initially display a limited list, and there's a button or link that you click to show more
[17:38:37] <k_sze[work]> hmm, accordion?
[17:39:23] <k_sze[work]> not exactly what I have in mind
[17:40:48] <k_sze[work]> I mean one *flat* list, just that less items are shown initially.

[18:45:03] <kris99> i need to get the quantity value on that input
[18:46:10] <kris99> or should i maybe add the quantity on the button whenever it changes ? so i just need to get the button's property when submitting

[19:13:16] <zulcc> kris99: jquery form plugin
[19:13:23] <kris99> it's not a form
[19:14:48] <kris99> i mean it is -.-, but it's just 1 input field and 1 button
[19:14:52] <kris99> and i need to send an ajax request
[19:15:06] <kris99> problem is there are 10 exact same div's on the page
[19:18:45] <zulcc> you can initialize the form plugin for a class as well
[19:19:09] <zulcc> might need an external callback to call recursively if you only ever want to show the same page
[19:20:29] <zulcc> (to re-initialize the form plugin on newly created forms)
[19:25:48] <monk3y> kris99: I can't understand your issue exactly, but if you haven't solved it yet, wouldn't it be something like; on button-click, get the parent-span, its next-sibling, then its child-input, then the value of that?
[19:26:03] <kris99> http://jsfiddle.net/4rj3T/
[19:26:06] <kris99> this is my html
[19:26:37] <monk3y> Yeah I saw your link before, hence my pseudo-code traversing your HTML elements.
[19:28:24] <zulcc> kris99: i might have completely misunderstood you, or this might be similar to what you're trying to do. always submit to & view the same page updated http://dpaste.com/1544618/
[19:29:37] <oste> what is a good way to chain an unknown number of ajax requests?
[19:29:50] <oste> ie. when one completes the next one is fired
[19:29:59] <zulcc> recursive, each time you click a form submit it reloads the updated page and re-initializes the form plugin on all forms of a class="foo"

[23:03:33] <grafi> fattest I cant get it to work either, so take comfort in that :P
[23:03:56] <jphase> raj: you need to have a closure that has some methods. you can return your object for chaining optionally and such. here's something I started on that does something simmilar for wysiwyg editors on the page (don't judge, it's not done):    https://github.com/jphase/wysiwyg/blob/master/js/wysiwyg.js
[23:03:58] <fattest> grafi: is there an alternative way to input description fields?
[23:04:03] <fattest> grafi: thank you so much for tyring
[23:04:21] <grafi> dont know, dont know the plugin at all :|
[23:04:29] <jphase> fattest: sorry, I didn't see your question, I just saw that you had a problem without describing it and figured I'd at least make light of the issue heh
[23:04:41] <grafi> jphase you ass :P

[23:05:06] <fattest> grafi: i got this to work http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/25/ but it only works for the first image
[23:05:31] <grafi> well that should help
[23:05:45] <grafi> seems to be a very complicated setup to me though
[23:06:05] <fattest> grafi: as soon as you click next, the description changes but then disappears
[23:06:13] <grafi> yeah I see
[23:11:47] <fattest> grafi: any news
[23:12:32] <grafi> well im thinking you have to modify the code where it finds the description somehow, seems it always edits the first slide
[23:13:16] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/33/ fattest this seems to work
[23:13:42] <fattest> grafi: thank you very very much
[23:13:46] <fattest> grafi: what was the problem
[23:13:46] <grafi> node = this.container.find('.description').eq(index); i added the .eq(index) not sure thats the best way, but it does add the description
[23:13:59] <fattest> grafi: goodie!
[23:14:05] <fattest> grafi: you're a genius; thanks
[23:14:10] <grafi> np
[23:19:00] <raj> jphase, so I can just take the stuff within $.fn.makeMenu and throw it within this.each(function)?
[23:19:53] <jphase> raj: yeah you can even put your init function inside of there (or any other function for that matter). It really depends on how you want to structure your plugin
[23:20:10] <raj> I just want to abstract the whole .each() thing
[23:20:15] <raj> so I don't have to think about it
[23:20:38] <raj> I guess putting everything within $.fn.makeMenu would accomplish that?
[23:20:58] <jphase> yeah what I do is have my method that returns each element selected
[23:21:12] <jphase> but there's a lot of ways to do it really
[23:21:14] <raj> cuz if I have to put .each within my init function, then I'll have to do it for every subsequent function too
[23:21:17] <raj> right?
[23:21:47] <jphase> yeah, that's why you see that syntax as an option often
[23:25:01] <jphase> raj: you might want to check out this post and trim all the fat in it... it's got a decent plugin wrapper for ECMAScript 3 with closures that are done well and an init function:     http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[23:28:48] <jphase> that type of wrapper will provide you with most everything you'll need moving forward so you don't have to facepalm and rewrite everything when you need another part of the DOM returned
[23:29:00] <jphase> but that's just my opinion...
[23:29:07] <jphase> otherwise the answer is 14 :D
[23:29:25] <larsemil> question: on a page i have a $('input.quant').change(). I also have a function to add rows with input. The change does not react on the new rows even though they have same class name.
[23:29:40] <larsemil> Do i have to re-read the dom in any way or what?
[23:30:16] <jphase> larsemil: you'll have to rebind the events to the new elements
[23:30:20] <Clex> larsemil: $(document).on('change', 'input.quand', function() {})
[23:30:34] <larsemil> Clex: i was just googling .on.
[23:30:42] <larsemil> Clex: will try. thank you very much
[23:32:02] <larsemil> Clex: YES! <3
