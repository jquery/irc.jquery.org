[00:02:17] <ajaxbud> HI guys, have a problem again, I am storing the names of movies in a db using ajax when user inputs them in a textbox. This textbox uses a jquery plugin which tikenizes the input text in to <li> tags and this obviously happens on the fly.
[00:02:37] <ajaxbud> When user refreshes the page I want to retireve the movie names fro mthe db and display them  in the same textbox
[00:02:41] <ajaxbud> how could this be achieved
[00:02:57] <ajaxbud> and remember while displaying the names again, it should be tokenized
[00:03:07] <coldhead> lol toke
[00:03:07] <ajaxbud> in the same way as earlier..
[00:03:31] <ajaxbud> yeah lol coldhead..
[00:04:06] <ajaxbud> is mgm there?
[00:04:15] <ajaxbud> oops, it is mgw
[00:04:28] <Smekman> He was
[00:04:39] <Smekman> Dont know if that's still true
[00:04:52] <ajaxbud> oh
[00:05:02] <IgnisDiabolus> what is tokenize?
[00:05:04] <ajaxbud> anybody who can throw light upon my problem?
[00:05:09] <dr0id> lol bloat
[00:05:42] <ajaxbud> as in facebook, when u enter a text it appears with a small 'x' mark
[00:06:47] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a problem with the jquery-autocomplete. I use a url as source, that returns a json. That is not displayed as autocomplete. if i take the same json that is returned by the url and define a var with exactly this json and set the source to this var, it works. any suggestions on whats the difference between a returned json and a predefined json?
[00:08:34] <codeho> ajaxbud: 'tokenize' is  a strange choice of word for this behavior.
[00:08:46] <coldhead> ajaxbud: http://jsfiddle.net/44WvL/ something like that
[00:09:16] <coldhead> gives you a lot of details to fil in but you see the approach
[00:09:39] <ajaxbud> thanks coldhead.. will take a look
[00:10:05] <ajaxbud> hey coldhead
[00:10:34] <ajaxbud> the problem is when I refresh the page the input strings just disappear
[00:10:53] <coldhead> i thought you sent them to the server
[00:10:53] <ajaxbud> I want them to be there even when the page is first visited or is refreshed
[00:10:58] <coldhead> i was showing you how to retrieve them
[00:11:03] <ajaxbud> sending them to the server is working fine
[00:11:06] <coldhead> you might like to use cookies then
[00:11:10] <ajaxbud> I have the movie names in the database now
[00:11:24] <ajaxbud> I want them to be displayed back wehn user revisits
[00:11:32] <coldhead> cookies!
[00:11:35] <ajaxbud> or even when user refreshes
[00:11:57] <ajaxbud> hmmm..usage of cookies
[00:12:15] <coldhead> this is the kind of thing they're there for! https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[00:12:26] <IgnisDiabolus> get the db info with php and display data once user refreshes
[00:12:35] <ajaxbud> say the user logs out and the comes back and loggs in
[00:12:39] <coldhead> ?g cookie monster delete cookies
[00:12:43] <IgnisDiabolus> since you're saving it in db
[00:12:47] <ajaxbud> will he see the same movie names even then?
[00:13:27] <ajaxbud> but I am using a plugin for the textbox which actually as I said tokenizes the string input,
[00:13:37] <prodn> when you .load(); a page with jQuery, you lose all previous included(PHP) files and all links to .js-files i <header>. Any way to fix this in an easy way? Or do I have to include just about everything when I load an external file?
[00:13:51] <ajaxbud> so even if I fetch the data back from cookies how am I gonna display them in the same tokenized format again?
[00:14:06] <catro> hi
[00:14:14] <IgnisDiabolus> that's what firebug is for
[00:15:20] <coldhead> prodn: it strips those out so you don't reinclude things
[00:15:33] <coldhead> if you want to reload them you can do it explicitly with $.getScript()
[00:20:08] <Smekman> Anyone got suggestiong of an IDE? Dreamweaver aint too great I'm noticing ..
[00:21:40] <[mgw]> for what kind of dev
[00:21:52] <[mgw]> i thought dreamweaver was kinda slow
[00:23:45] <arena_> I like NetBeans
[00:24:12] <Smekman> Well it's css, jquery and php i'm working with right now mainy
[00:24:14] <Smekman> mainly
[00:24:52] <arena_> Can I get some help on a script I've been working on?
[00:25:19] <Smekman> dreamweaver has this ugly tendency to break things in the preview, and I'm told netbeans is cool that way.. I'd rather just go notepad on all of it, but having that preview has proven to be somewhat of a godsend
[00:25:19] <filename> if i preload some <input>'s into existing <form> through $.get() will be this inputs part of form or not?
[00:25:28] <arena_> I pasted a copy of it on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[00:27:07] <filename> if i preload some <input>'s into existing <form> through $.get() will be this inputs part of form or not?
[00:27:24] <Smekman> WHy are you repeating yourself?
[00:27:55] <filename> i need fast answer, the question is not so hard
[00:28:09] <Smekman> You still dont need to be your own echo
[00:30:19] <ajaxbud> haha filename not found
[00:30:39] <KarateKip3> not found?
[00:30:57] <KarateKip3> hehehe... :)
[00:33:01] <prodn> coldhead: how can I do $.getScript() when the jQuery-lib is not included anymore? When I $.load() a page, every script loaded in the main page does not get included in the ajax page, it seems
[00:34:06] <coldhead> prodn: the script that is calling .load() has full access to jquery
[00:34:11] <coldhead> do it in there
[00:34:25] <coldhead> jquery doesn't get unloaded
[00:35:10] <prodn> should I do $.getScript() in the new file that I load or in the $.load() function?
[00:44:32] <coldhead> prodn: in the file that is doing the ,load()
[00:44:36] <coldhead> that makes sense to me
[00:44:41] <coldhead> conceptually
[00:44:53] <coldhead> 1) load this other html, 2) load the stuff that goes with it
[00:44:57] <coldhead> but that's just a matter of taste
[00:45:27] <RLa> why lot of examples and tutorials use code like $("<div/>").appendTo(...) while jquery manual has no documentation on such constructs
[00:45:49] <coldhead> it sure does have documentation for it
[00:45:54] <RLa> how the heck is "<div/>" valid selector?
[00:46:03] <RLa> coldhead, so where it is?
[00:46:17] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[00:46:38] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME
[00:46:40] <coldhead> GO IN PEACE
[00:47:24] <arena_> Hi all could I get someone to look at my jQuery script?
[00:47:26] <RLa> you do not have to yell
[00:47:40] <arena_> It isn't working like I was expecting: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[00:48:04] <[mgw]> RLa i think $('<div/>') is a shortcut to just make a new el
[00:48:18] <[mgw]> jquery is kinda confusing i think like that
[00:48:30] <RLa> [mgw], it should be pointed out in manual better way
[00:48:54] <[mgw]> i think bottom line is there are 1000 ways you can do stuff in jQuery
[00:49:06] <[mgw]> shit, i've worked with it since 1.1?
[00:49:19] <[mgw]> i'm not even sure... anyway, they just seem to keep adding stuff
[00:49:30] <[mgw]> and then everyone talks about it, but the core functionality doesn't seem to change
[00:49:52] <RLa> "everyone", online web tutorials are the last thing i trust
[00:49:58] <[mgw]> hahahaha
[00:50:04] <belevele> hi, i want to change the background of a div on hover, i mean to toggle it. ex: on hover: backgorund - red, else background - white. is it possible something like this: $('#my_div').hover(function(){  // code here to toggle it   });
[00:50:23] <[mgw]> i just think it's this type of stuff in general, but yah - manuals are good
[00:50:24] <RLa> written by noobs who only tested their code on specific browser with specific version
[00:50:29] <[mgw]> yea
[00:50:51] <[mgw]> i think i'm gonna hire someone to platform test all my code when i'm ready to put it out
[00:51:30] <RLa> well, you should test often and not only 'at the end' when the code is supposed to be ready
[00:51:45] <arena_> belevele I think you're much better off using css for that
[00:52:26] <[mgw]> yea
[00:52:41] <[mgw]> i think deployment is an intrinsic problem to web dev
[00:53:04] <[mgw]> i guess opposed to some proprietary dev where you do 1 system config only
[00:53:08] <belevele> arena_, i'm using css right now with a:hover.. but want to make it cross-browser and i use margin and padding in px... im afraid of others browsers/versions
[00:54:08] <davetarmac> Hi folks
[00:54:26] <belevele> arena_, isnt it possible to have a condition into the hover() event? something like this hover(function(){ ///   is(mouse_over(#id) then blah ELSE no blah;          //// });
[00:55:20] <RLa> isn't 'a' inline element at all, so margin and padding makes no sense?
[00:55:41] <davetarmac> I'm having a bit of a play with jQuery .toggle() to animate the height of a div at the top of the screen to show and hide when clicked. I have it showing fine, but ideally I would like each toggle to hide any divs that are existing (that are associated with with toggles on the page).
[00:55:52] <davetarmac> I've done a fiddle that might illustrate things better: http://jsfiddle.net/BfWZY/
[00:56:39] <belevele> RLa, it is, but i have this situation: a div with width 39px and height 110px, and with a link "blog" into the div... on hover i have to change the background of the div... so thats why i use margin and padding.
[01:02:17] <prodn> in my index.php I include alot of js in my <head> with the <script type="text/javascript....> etc. In the index.php I got a <div id="hello">. When I $("#hello").load('file.php'); no js-script in the index.php gets to the file.php. I can't include every script-file into every file that I load with ajax. Is there a workaround for this?
[01:13:45] <jbooker> has anyone got any experience with jstoke's jquery window plugin?
[01:13:56] <held> does anyone know what i'm missing?
[01:13:56] <held> http://jsfiddle.net/Mr5zg/
[01:14:01] <held> my toggle just won't work
[01:14:31] <edgardo> I'll take a look
[01:16:04] <held> thanks
[01:17:52] <edgardo> held, maybe change your framework to jquery to the left will help? :)
[01:17:53] <held> hmm it seems that i had not included jquery on jsfiddle
[01:18:14] <held> yea but still, it's not working outside of jsfiddle :p
[01:18:24] <Cork> and onready don't work in onload :)
[01:18:33] <held> thanks for checking it out though
[01:18:36] <Cork> either put the event in head, or remove onready
[01:18:36] <edgardo> do you have your .js script before jquery.js in your <head> ?
[01:19:02] <held> no, the jquery file comes first
[01:19:18] <edgardo> and you have the exact same code on your page?
[01:19:23] <held> yea
[01:19:30] <edgardo> hmm
[01:19:42] <held> but i don't see onload anywhere though, Cork
[01:19:56] <Cork> held: in the dropdown before jquery on the left
[01:20:17] <edgardo> there's no other elements on the page conflicting in the class/ID department?
[01:20:18] <Cork> held: do you have a link to your page?
[01:21:06] <edgardo> with simple and short code like that I can't see why it could fail
[01:21:12] <held> i only have it locally , it's a rails app
[01:21:32] <held> the chrome console is giving me "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;"
[01:21:36] <Cork> held: see if you can reproduce the generated html and js then
[01:21:41] <Cork> aha
[01:21:51] <Cork> what happens on that line?
[01:22:25] <edgardo> I always try and depyg with alert('lol'); step by step :)
[01:22:36] <edgardo> debug*
[01:22:40] <Cork> ugg alerts...
[01:22:45] <edgardo> heh, yeah
[01:22:47] <Cork> at least use console.log :)
[01:23:18] <edgardo> nah, I hate bringing up and closing that ugly colsole window :)
[01:23:21] <held> yea i tried that, it's not showing the alert :p
[01:23:37] <Cork> held: ya, cause you have a parsing error
[01:23:39] <prodn> anyone thinking about my question for 21 minutes ago?
[01:23:42] <Cork> so the code never runs
[01:24:04] <held> the parsing error just went away, not sure why
[01:24:09] <Cork> held: so in the error you see, go to your source and look at that line
[01:24:44] <edgardo> prodn, sry didn't see it, wasn't online then :)
[01:25:10] <held> Cork: i'm no longer getting the code for some reason
[01:25:37] <Cork> prodn: you shouldn't include js through load
[01:25:55] <Cork> use getScript or similar
[01:27:15] <held> ffs, sorry for the trouble guys i found the problem
[01:27:32] <held> i had assigned the click-id to the wrong button
[01:27:37] <AdvoWork> hi there, im trying to use jquery's auto complete from an external DB. My php file returns the data correctly, but the actual jquery bit isnt doing anything. My code is http://pastebin.com/0D4fjjW1  Any suggestions please? Can't figure out where im going wrong
[01:27:50] <held> so i was clicking the wrong link and that's why nothing was happening
[01:28:01] <mattyh88> why does this line: $('.activities').html(' ' + $('input[template_agreement_gifts[activities]]:checked + label').text() give me the text of the labels of all my checked radiobuttons in my form?
[01:28:10] <mattyh88> instead of just the text of the label of the activity field
[01:29:09] <Cork> mattyh88: [template_agreement_gifts[activities]] doesn't look right
[01:29:19] <Cork> is that the name attrubute?
[01:29:45] <mattyh88> Cork: name="template_agreement_gifts[activities]"
[01:30:04] <Cork> try [name="template_agreement_gifts[activities]"]:checked then
[01:32:03] <mattyh88> Cork: ahhhh yeha :p that's it forgot "name" :p
[01:32:05] <mattyh88> thx
[01:32:11] <Cork> np :)
[01:37:07] <shwaiil> hi ppl
[01:37:50] <edgardo> yo
[01:44:30] <ximarin> hm, is there a chan for jqueryui related qustions?
[01:45:10] <Ortund> ximarin I think this chan basically covers everything to do with jquery
[01:45:23] <ximarin> hm, then i have to repost my question ^^
[01:45:28] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a problem with the jquery-autocomplete. I use a url as source, that returns a json. That is not displayed as autocomplete. if i take the same json that is returned by the url and define a var with exactly this json and set the source to this var, it works. any suggestions on whats the difference between a returned json and a predefined json?
[01:48:06] <Slartibart> Suppose I need to remove some chunk of html from the page, but possibly reinsert it later. Would it be quicker to detach it and keep it in memory? Or is it better to just remove it and append html code at that later time instead? It should be quicker to detach, right? (Ignoring memory issues)
[01:51:33] <prodn> I have a button, and I have <div id="foo"> and <div id="bar">. When $(button).click() I want the #bar-div to get cloned and inside the #foo-div. I want one new copy for each time I click the button. How can I make this? I tried .clone() .appendTo() .add() and .append() but no success.
[01:53:00] <Cork> prodn: clone should do what you want
[01:53:42] <squeakytoy> Hey all. A newbie question, but i am trying to send an object via jquery.ajax, but when I get it in back-end, its encoded like it was a query string. Anyone know if i need to modify the object first or something?
[01:56:45] <Cork> prodn: http://jsfiddle.net/q5QnA/
[01:56:46] <codeho> squeakytoy: look at the ajax param datatype
[01:58:04] <prodn> Cork: how do I also get the child-items of bar? And did you remove the id so it didn't one div for each existing one?
[01:58:48] <Cork> prodn: you can only have one id in the dom
[01:58:58] <Cork> so you would get an invalid dom if you kepts the id
[01:59:16] <Cork> $('#foo') will only return one element
[01:59:27] <Cork> if you have multible id="foo" in the dom
[01:59:33] <squeakytoy> codeho: yea, i am using "json" as the datatype. I will just try a thing here,and it if doesnt work, ill show some code :-)
[01:59:39] <Cork> its a guess witch one is returned
[02:00:32] <prodn> Cork: ok well ofc. Anyway, how do I also get the child elements, if any, of the cloned elemnt?
[02:01:03] <Cork> prodn: not sure what your after http://jsfiddle.net/q5QnA/1/
[02:01:50] <Cork> to make what happens a bit more obvius http://jsfiddle.net/q5QnA/2/
[02:03:01] <squeakytoy> When I am sending an Object via a "json" jquery ajax, I am getting the request data encoded with & etc - anyone know what I should do to keep the curly brackets { in the request data? http://pastebin.com/JriHsBeX
[02:03:46] <Cork> squeakytoy: your prob sending it as a javascript object
[02:04:02] <Cork> jquery converts them to parameters
[02:04:18] <Cork> you need to convert it to json and send it as a single parameter
[02:04:42] <Cork> $.ajax({ data: { json: JSON.stringify(my_obj) });
[02:05:04] <Cork> then it will come as a single parameter with json in it to the server
[02:05:11] <JackJones> hi all, is for that a common feature: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7933063/is-there-an-existing-alphabetized-list-widget-for-jquery-mobile
[02:06:00] <squeakytoy> I kinda thought JSON was kinda the same as a JavaScript object :o
[02:06:07] <Cork> its not
[02:06:10] <Cork> json is a string
[02:06:21] <Cork> javascript object is a memory object with references
[02:06:38] <Cork> ?eval "your there?"
[02:06:44] <squeakytoy> ok, but the JSON string shares the same structure as a javascript object tho?
[02:06:45] <Cork> -_- nope
[02:07:07] <Cork> squeakytoy: no, it is a subset of javascript objects
[02:07:36] <Cork> { key:"value"} valid javascript, invalid json
[02:07:58] <Cork> {"key":'value'} valid javascript invalid json
[02:08:07] <squeakytoy> Cork: anyways, the JSON.stringify(data) got it working too, thanks
[02:08:19] <squeakytoy> Cork, hmm, ok
[02:08:26] <Cork> {"key":function() { return "hi!"; }} --"--
[02:08:51] <squeakytoy> So my problem is that I think JSON are JS objects, but i should really see JSON as just another format, like XML
[02:09:17] <Cork> its a compact static data transfer protocol
[02:09:36] <Cork> its syntax can easily be mapped to javascript objects
[02:09:42] <Cork> but thats it
[02:09:43] <JackJones> is there a official way for that ?
[02:09:47] <xec> Cork: ha, you had me wondering a second there what sort of javascript black magic the --"-- was :P
[02:09:57] <Cork> xec: lol
[02:10:09] <Cork> JackJones: JSON exists in all modern browsers
[02:10:23] <Cork> ie8 doesn't though
[02:10:35] <Cork> but... its not modern :)
[02:10:40] <JackJones> Cork: i mean the technical way
[02:11:01] <Cork> JackJones: what?
[02:11:21] <JackJones> abc list, is there not a other way for that ?
[02:12:00] <Cork> JackJones: not sure what you want, you didn't even ask a question
[02:12:32] <Cork> (thought you meant about our discusion about json :) )
[02:12:34] <JackJones> http://jsfiddle.net/qXT9Z/32/ -> i find there must be a better way for htat
[02:12:47] <JackJones> Cork: ohhh no sorrry :-)
[02:14:06] <Cork> JackJones: you could use a separat column to store the data if you want, or a class
[02:14:14] <Cork> but no, that looks quite fine to me
[02:14:23] <JackJones> Cork: okay thank you
[02:14:30] <Cork> np
[02:14:50] <JackJones> Cork: on last question, i have to display 10'000 contact in a list, whats the best way for that ?
[02:15:35] <Cork> i think i would use infinit scroll at least
[02:16:00] <Cork> loading 10k contacts at once over mobile connections will prob be slow
[02:18:03] <AdvoWork> hi there, im trying to use jquery's auto complete from an external DB. My php file returns the data correctly, but the actual jquery bit isnt doing anything. My code is http://pastebin.com/0D4fjjW1  Any suggestions please? Can't figure out where im going wrong
[02:20:59] <cambazz> hello. anyone has any ideas how to constraint user input data
[02:21:08] <cambazz> like i dont want ppl to enter allcaps and stuff
[02:21:09] <xec> AdvoWork: what does the data returned from states.php look like?
[02:21:55] <Cork> cambazz: validate the input in onkeypress
[02:22:18] <RLa> AdvoWork, verify you send with correct ContentType
[02:22:18] <cambazz> well, i know how to validate it, i mean technically
[02:22:27] <cambazz> i just need some ideas on constraining user input
[02:23:58] <Cork> cambazz: that was what i meant
[02:24:13] <Cork> cambazz: if you block the input through onkeypress it won't be entered
[02:25:44] <AdvoWork> xec, the data returned is outputted like ["test","test2","test3","test4"]
[02:25:50] <AdvoWork> RLa, how would I go about doing that?
[02:26:33] <RLa> curl -v http://your-ip/path-to-service
[02:27:26] <RLa> response must contain < Content-Type: application/json
[02:27:50] <AdvoWork> RLa, hmm, that gives < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[02:27:58] <RLa> that is very wrong
[02:28:05] <AdvoWork> what needs changing/where do i set that then?
[02:28:10] <prodn> with :parent selector or .parent() I can select the parent. Yes. But how do I select the parents parent?
[02:28:18] <RLa> no idea about php, google for it
[02:28:35] <RLa> you probably have to send correct header value manually
[02:28:38] <xec> i think you can just do head() in php, before any output
[02:28:45] <xec> iirc
[02:28:50] <Cork> cambazz: http://jsfiddle.net/26FmF/
[02:28:58] <xec> no, header()
[02:29:00] <AdvoWork> but its returning echo json_encode($return_arr);  which i thought was fine/enough?
[02:29:17] <RLa> AdvoWork, yes but it's not
[02:29:27] <RLa> at least not for php
[02:29:33] <Cork> AdvoWork: it is if you set dataType in the ajax call
[02:29:56] <Cork> else jquery checks the content type header
[02:30:04] <RLa> seems like php cannot detect correct response ContentType even if you use that function
[02:30:19] <AdvoWork> RLa, ok now returns Content-Type: application/json  but still doesnt work
[02:30:36] <Cork> RLa: just cause your generating json doen't mean what you output is json
[02:30:41] <Cork> so how could it
[02:30:54] <RLa> FF usually complains in error console if you use wrong contenttype
[02:31:15] <RLa> i guess then something else is broken too
[02:31:39] <Cork> AdvoWork: do you get any data at all in your success callback?
[02:33:22] <AdvoWork> Cork, just added a success call back http://pastebin.com/YXgDHDvv  but it doesnt alert anything what so ever
[02:34:32] <Cork> AdvoWork: ugg thats what you get when you jump into the middle of a conversation >_>
[02:34:46] <Cork> AdvoWork: no i don't think autocomplete has a success callback
[02:35:06] <RLa> AdvoWork, btw, your error handling in php will produce invalid json on errors
[02:35:26] <RLa> AdvoWork, the proper thing would be to send error status 500 in those cases
[02:36:28] <AdvoWork> Cork, im lost sorry
[02:37:52] <Cork> AdvoWork: you can remove the success and dataType from the option list
[02:37:57] <Cork> they have no meaning for autocomplete
[02:40:27] <Cork> AdvoWork: if you inspect the connection to the server what does it show?
[02:40:41] <Cork> especially the response headers
[02:43:32] <nirav> wsp?
[02:44:54] <nirav> w3school is a better mean to learn than the official doc.
[02:46:02] <AdvoWork> Cork, think ive got it working now
[02:51:29] <davetarmac> I'm having a bit of a play with jQuery .toggle() to animate the height of a div at the top of the screen to show and hide when clicked. I have it showing fine, but ideally I would like each toggle to hide any divs that are existing (that are associated with with toggles on the page).
[02:51:33] <davetarmac> I've done a fiddle that might illustrate things better: http://jsfiddle.net/BfWZY/
[02:55:28] <xec> davetarmac:  maybe define "something good" and "something else" - not entirely clear what you want to achieve :)
[02:55:59] <davetarmac> xec - basically, when I click the first link, the red drops down. This is good.
[02:56:31] <davetarmac> xec - when I click on the 2nd link, I would like to see the red one animate it's ass back up, then animate the blue one coming down
[02:56:39] <davetarmac> basically replacing it
[02:57:31] <davetarmac> but it would need to be general so that if more links are added, I don't have to keep adding lines to the different functions (if at all possible)
[02:59:01] <ohcibi> isnt there a short form for $.extend(a, a, b); ??
[02:59:26] <ohcibi> i just tried a.extend(b) (where a is a jquery object) but it just overwrites a with b
[03:00:49] <xec> davetarmac: hm, i would probably create a helper function to hide all visible "popups" and call that on each toggle-animate-in event handler
[03:01:18] <ohcibi> hm nvm i wasnt looking close enough
[03:01:55] <davetarmac> xec: right - i have no idea how to do that :p
[03:02:57] <codeho> $('.visible_popup').hide().removeClass('.visible_popup'); ?
[03:02:59] <xec> davetarmac: i'm just headed to lunch, but i started one for you, its not finished but you get the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/BfWZY/1/
[03:03:54] <davetarmac> oh right, I get it - thanks for the assist xec
[03:09:46] <chee> i've just come back from the vet, my dog is dead
[03:10:29] <Smekman> Such things do happen
[03:10:35] <EdwardIII> hrm
[03:10:57] <EdwardIII> https://gist.github.com/1451133 # what's do i do to make this load with 0 width?
[03:11:15] <codeho> chee: sorry to hear that.
[03:11:17] <EdwardIII> if i actually change the width to 0 then the toggle won't work, will it?
[03:15:17] <ohcibi> $('#a input').extend($('#b input')); should extend the set of inputs in #a by the inputs in #b, right??
[03:15:30] <Kingsy> if something like this checks to see if it DOES contain the string, what would check to see if it doesnt? url.indexOf("hello") >= 0   ?
[03:15:47] <EdwardIII> Kingsy: == -1  ?
[03:15:53] <EdwardIII> Kingsy: check the manual though
[03:16:46] <Kingsy> ok
[03:23:25] <alex88> hi guys, calling 2 times $(this).click() will bind a function 2 times, using on multiple times on same element etc, will it rebind instead of binding multiple times?
[03:24:27] <quicksilver> no, it will bind multiple times
[03:24:33] <quicksilver>  you can always unbind
[03:24:52] <alex88> before binding again...mmhh
[03:25:08] <alex88> using one() ?
[03:25:59] <alex88> like $(document).one('click','selector',function(){});
[03:27:02] <quicksilver> that's different. That binds a handler which only runs once.
[03:27:50] <alex88> true, in fact it runs function two times...
[03:27:50] <Cork> alex88: you might be looking for live or delegate
[03:28:44] <ohcibi> what i want is the elements of a and b combined, however it just overwrites the first with the second set of elements... oddly its not overwriting all elements...  anyone sees whats wrong?? http://jsfiddle.net/wEZCY/1/
[03:29:06] <Kingsy> is there a way to stop js or jquery in the middle of a query and tell it to go to a url? I have tried window.location.href = "blah"; but that doesnt seem to stop it executing unless I am debugging this wrong
[03:29:13] <alex88> Cork: maybe, but what if i call live or delegate multiple times on same element with same event? will it fire that 2 times?
[03:29:39] <alex88> Cork: btw they are both superseded by the .on() method
[03:29:47] <Cork> alex88: there isn't a single function that does that
[03:29:56] <Cork> alex88: not superseeded
[03:30:02] <Cork> on is just another short hand
[03:30:11] <alex88> Cork: kk, so i think i'll go with unbind ;)
[03:30:37] <Cork> Kingsy: c = a.add(b)
[03:30:52] <Cork> alex88: i would prob use a namespace
[03:30:53] <Kingsy> Cork: huh?
[03:31:14] <ohcibi> i made the example even simpler: http://jsfiddle.net/wEZCY/2/ why is extend just overwriting the second array????
[03:31:16] <ohcibi> *first
[03:31:24] <Cork> alex88: some_elm.unbind('.all_my_events').bind('click.all_by_events', function...)
[03:31:45] <alex88> Cork: faster ;) thanks
[03:32:17] <Cork> ohcibi: you don't want to extend it
[03:32:21] <Cork> you want to merge them
[03:32:25] <Cork> see above
[03:32:35] <Cork> opps worng nick
[03:32:46] <Cork> Kingsy: sorry wrong nick
[03:32:53] <Cork> ohcibi: this was for you  c = a.add(b)
[03:33:05] <ohcibi> Cork: ah...k 8-))
[03:33:43] <ohcibi> Cork: thx
[03:33:43] <Cork> ohcibi: extend extends parameters, jquery store its selections in an internal variable
[03:33:49] <Cork> so extend doesn't work
[03:35:02] <dokma> I've just used mouseout to hide a popped up drop down menu but it sometimes works sometimes now in the sense that I can sometimes leave the submenu and it doesn't hide.
[03:35:17] <dokma> you can see it here: http://www.darvitalis.hr
[03:35:27] <dokma> on the proizvodi menu
[03:36:54] <Cork> dokma: bind mouseout on the li instead of the ul
[03:37:04] <Cork> that should do the trick
[03:37:06] <dokma> ok
[03:37:45] <dokma> still the same
[03:37:46] <Kingsy> Cork: any ideas about my issue?
[03:37:59] <dokma> about once in 6,7 times it doesn't hide where I leave it
[03:38:17] <dokma> Cork: you ever encountered something like this?
[03:38:28] <Cork> sure
[03:39:03] <Cork> where is the code your using?
[03:39:11] <Cork> all files i can find is 404
[03:39:41] <Cork> ah...
[03:39:45] <dokma> Cork: 404 ?
[03:39:46] <Cork> ugg base...
[03:40:04] <zatan> hi how can i append text below td ? http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/1/
[03:40:26] <zatan> its appending but Postcode is moving from his position too
[03:40:27] <Cork> dokma: ya i tried to load them without the base meta url
[03:40:38] <dokma> ahhh...
[03:40:42] <Cork> dokma: you went he wrong way
[03:40:53] <Cork> you went futher in the tree instead of outwards
[03:40:56] <dokma> Cork: I'm listening
[03:41:23] <dokma> Cork: I don't quite follow what you're trying to say
[03:41:39] <Cork> i meant bind #menu .widget-content > ul > li
[03:42:09] <dokma> to mouseout? isn't that what I did with: $('#menu ul li').mouseout(function () {
[03:42:26] <Cork> no you bound it to all lis in the list
[03:42:44] <Cork> as all lis as a parent of ul
[03:42:51] <Cork> so you could just as well removed ul
[03:43:34] <Cork> same with the selector your using in the event
[03:43:56] <Cork> base it on $(this) instead so you don't affect things you don't intend to
[03:44:03] <dokma> are you trying to say I should bing mouseout just to the specific dropdown that has popped up?
[03:44:11] <dokma> ahhh.... I see
[03:44:23] <Cork> no the first event should be on the outer most li's
[03:44:37] <Cork> but what it does sould be specific to its own children
[03:44:43] <Cork> *should
[03:44:53] <dokma> I see
[03:45:20] <dokma> somethins like $().find('ul') ??
[03:45:27] <dokma> somethins like $(this).find('ul') ??
[03:45:45] <Cork> or even better children('ul')
[03:45:53] <dokma> I see
[03:46:20] <Cork> that way you don't mess with submenus or things like that
[03:46:35] <Cork> or you might want to do that, and then yes find would be correct
[03:47:18] <Cork> dokma: my basic point is limit what element you affect to those you know you want to affect, then you have less risk of messing future things up
[03:47:30] <dokma> Cork: I get that point
[03:47:42] <dokma> I seem to have messed the syntax somewhere
[03:47:52] <dokma> can you throw another look at it?
[03:47:53] <Cork> having to go over old code and redo them cause they mess up your "new shiny thing" isn't fun :)
[03:48:09] <dokma> Cork: had that happen a few times
[03:48:18] <Cork> its $(this) not this.children
[03:52:49] <dokma> Cork: now it's solid! thanks man!
[04:00:05] <EdwardIII> hey champs, what's the best way to make this load with 0 width?  https://gist.github.com/1451133
[04:02:20] <Ring0`> Hi. I know that it would probably work if done on divs but infortunatelly it's on list so I'd like to ask if I can get it to work. I have <li class="tap1">AAAA<ul><li class="tap2">BBBBB</li></ul></li>. If I set rule $("[class*=tap1]").mouseover(function(); then it will trigger once again if i move from AAA to BBB (even that it's still in li.tap1). Can I somehow make it not retrigger?
[04:06:37] <EdwardIII> Ring0`: this any good? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2539269/jquery-do-only-once
[04:08:34] <Ring0`> Hm EdwardIII Thanks but unfortunatelly no since it's background highlighter in rollout menu. This function will prevent from further highlighting.
[04:10:23] <zatan> How can i append Address nice after input ? http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/4/
[04:12:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/5/ ?
[04:14:06] <AdvoWork> if ive got: <select size="1" name="product_type" id="product_type" onchange="show_materials();"> with multiple options, why when I do this alert alert( $('select.product_type').val()  );  does it say undefined?
[04:14:25] <zatan> Cork, I want bellow input ?
[04:14:36] <zatan> sorry for confusing
[04:14:51] <Cork> AdvoWork: cause product_type isn't added as a class on the input?
[04:15:04] <Cork> ah
[04:15:41] <Cork> you want it below postcode or below the input field?
[04:17:07] <zatan> Cork, below input field
[04:17:32] <Cork> zatan: wrap the text in a div or prefix it with <br>
[04:21:45] <netAction> Hi! I can add local jSonP from file system using the SCRIPT element. What is the jQuery way to do this? I tweaked around with ajax() and getJson but without success.
[04:22:22] <Ankabout> hey guys, I'm having a weird problem, and I can't figure out where it's coming from. It's specific to IE7+8
[04:22:35] <Ankabout> anyone mind taking a look for me, then I'll pm the URL
[04:23:06] <Ankabout> basically I use this code: http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/m99Pk/   but slightly modified, and the background-colors of the blocks disappear in IE
[04:23:06] <ajaxbud> guys
[04:23:15] <ajaxbud> is it possible to use php script inside js?
[04:23:26] <netAction> ajaxbud: Yes
[04:23:38] <ajaxbud> the same way? <?php ... ?> ?
[04:24:01] <netAction> Yes but you have to enable PHP for js files.
[04:24:19] <netAction> Usually you want to rename your file from .js to .php
[04:24:33] <netAction> Then you send the js headers with php first.
[04:24:56] <ajaxbud> this is html code..
[04:25:09] <netAction> <? header('Content-type: application/pdf');
[04:25:23] <netAction> <? header('Content-type: script/javascript'); ?>
[04:25:25] <ajaxbud> I want tp include some php script inside the script tag for javascript
[04:25:42] <netAction> OK then simply do it.
[04:25:58] <netAction> You didn't say you have a HTML file.
[04:26:03] <ajaxbud> oh sorry
[04:26:07] <ajaxbud> soo simply do what?
[04:26:15] <ajaxbud> <?php .. ?>
[04:26:19] <netAction> <? echo "Hello World!" ?>
[04:26:50] <ajaxbud> actually I'm creating a json variable in php and then passing it on to js
[04:26:59] <ajaxbud> name of my variable is $json
[04:27:13] <ajaxbud> i want it to be used in one of the function variables in js
[04:27:16] <netAction> <? echo $json; ?>
[04:27:27] <ajaxbud> thats it right?
[04:27:30] <ajaxbud> let me try
[04:27:30] <netAction> yes
[04:29:36] <sahbeewah> so you can execute php in an external js file?
[04:29:47] <netAction> This is possible too.
[04:30:06] <netAction> But then you have to enable PHP parser for that file type.
[04:30:15] <netAction> AddHandler in Apache for example.
[04:30:23] <netAction> Or you rename the .js to .php
[04:31:22] <sahbeewah> suppose you renamed the js php, wouldn't that use the php include directive
[04:31:32] <sahbeewah> hence making it an inline js
[04:31:43] <Mkop> ajpiano: per your request: *scold scold scold*
[04:31:51] <netAction> sahbeewah: yes
[04:31:54] <ThiefMaster> <netAction> <? header('Content-type: script/javascript'); ?> <- text/javascript
[04:32:06] <Mkop> I am excited about what may be coming though
[04:32:32] <netAction> ThiefMaster: text/javascript is old and I think it is not valid any longer. IE fucks up with script/javascript.
[04:32:44] <Mkop> you can take this as an opportunity to make sure that you have daily or weekly backups running on the entire jquery infrastructure
[04:33:16] <ThiefMaster> well in every browser you use type="text/javascript"
[04:33:30] <netAction> I don't
[04:33:49] <ThiefMaster> according to wikipedia text/javascript is indeed obsolete but the proper one is application/javascript
[04:33:51] <ThiefMaster> not script/+
[04:34:06] <netAction> ThiefMaster: sorry you're right
[04:34:14] <ThiefMaster> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1288263/why-doesnt-ie8-recognize-type-application-javascript-in-a-script-tag
[04:34:19] <ThiefMaster> so, text/javascript is the way to go
[04:34:25] <ThiefMaster> unless you are lucky and can ignore ie
[04:34:50] <netAction> IE8 does not want to work. They added the bug. Not my problem.
[04:35:16] <netAction> I often write workarounds for bugs. But this is a bug they WANTED.
[04:37:22] <Ring0`> Hi. http://jsfiddle.net/hLxLM/ -- Why does alert trigger every time i rollover each text, rollout from it ? It should just work once, while i roll for the first time
[04:37:54] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/hLxLM/2/
[04:38:00] <Zogot> Ring0`
[04:38:17] <Ring0`> wow, oh
[04:38:23] <Ring0`> Ah
[04:38:53] <Ring0`> Zogot: It wont do the job since this rollover must handle background highlight in rollout menu :/ Using .one, when i rollout and rollover again it wont highlight.
[04:39:00] <Ring0`> Unless you can unbind .one somehow
[04:40:18] <ajaxbud> echo statement inside an alert doesnt work?
[04:40:20] <zatan> Cork,  i tried all different ways but still I am not getting right http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/6/   Postcode* start moving from his position
[04:40:44] <Cork> ah
[04:41:02] <ajaxbud> php echo statement inside an alert seems to display nothing.. I mean not even the alert
[04:41:12] <Cork> zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/7/
[04:41:17] <Cork> *zatan
[04:41:20] <Zogot> Ring0`: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/hLxLM/5/
[04:41:22] <zamba> hehe
[04:41:41] <zatan> Cork thanks:)
[04:41:47] <Cork> alternativly if you want a new row you can do (one min
[04:41:48] <Cork> )
[04:42:42] <Cork> zatan: http://jsfiddle.net/aETcZ/8/
[04:42:53] <ajaxbud> it says value of the variaable is not defined
[04:43:42] <Cork> ajaxbud: are you wrapping the php output in javascript quotes?
[04:43:59] <ajaxbud> oh no
[04:44:06] <ajaxbud> should I be doing tht?
[04:44:33] <ajaxbud> gotcha
[04:44:42] <Anime> http://jsfiddle.net/rkrkh/9/ <- anyone have any idea if is there a way to load a bunch of images like this without one load interfering within each other?
[04:45:04] <sahbeewah> Ring0`: what is that tap1 selector meant to be selecting?
[04:46:19] <Ring0`> sahbeewah: Well it should change the background of an item when inside tap1 and change it back when going out from tap1. Problem is that when you move mouse around tap1 is blinks (on/off) every time when you enter aaa or bbb or other li (tap2,3,4)
[04:46:25] <ajaxbud> stupid mistake, thanks Cork..
[04:46:32] <ajaxbud> my bad..
[04:46:34] <Ring0`> I don't get why it just can't keep it like being inside tap1.
[04:50:37] <yaazkal> Hello, I know that exist plugins like scrollTo.  I have a div with id "live"... I want to scroll to it but I don't want it to be at the left of my screnn (my site is horizontal), I need the "live" div to be centered after windows scroll, is there a method to do it ?
[04:51:06] <sahbeewah> Ring0`: can't seem to replicate that blinking problem
[04:51:24] <jrm2k6> hi all, I'm using appendTo, but when I append an li item to a second list, the first parent is still referenced
[04:51:41] <jrm2k6> http://pastebin.com/JJUSMzXr how I could manage the possibility to change the referenced parent?
[04:52:25] <Hackwar> hi folks, how can I access a specific element from a collection? Specifically, I have the following selector $('#thumbs li') and now want the element from the array at the index "index", to check if that <li> has an attribute "skip". How would I do that?
[04:57:46] <jrm2k6> Someone knows abotu a strange behabviour with the appendTo function?
[05:00:19] <Segaja> Hackwar: you can walk through the selected elements with .each() and check them manually
[05:01:09] <Hackwar> I don't need to walk through all elements. I only need to check that one specific element
[05:01:42] <Ring0`> sahbeewah: It was my bad. The problem of blinking gone too. Sorry for mess ;-)
[05:01:53] <ntoll> hi, how do I insert a <li> into a <ul> at a specific index..?
[05:02:20] <Neil> We're using the jQuery autocomplete for usernames in a textarea. Could we get autocomplete to also assign a value to a hidden attribute to indicate which remark is being replied to?
[05:02:23] <ntoll> prepend/append/before etc... don't work for this specific case
[05:03:26] <jrm2k6> Why when I click on my li,  it launchs the appendTo, thats expected, but if a reclick on the moved item, it is still referenced at the first place, how could I manage that : http://pastebin.com/JJUSMzXr
[05:03:35] <ntoll> Neil can you not add a callback to the autocomplete which fires when the value is selected, then in the callback function update the hidden attribute..?
[05:04:20] <Segaja> Hackwar: did you look at http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ ?
[05:06:08] <Hackwar> Segaja: I don't have to know if any element has that attribute, I need to know if that ONE SPECIFIC element has that attribute
[05:06:13] <Segaja> jrm2k6: maybe you need to remove the element from the old place?
[05:06:48] <Segaja> Hackwar: if the element to check is that specific, select it first by a unique identifier and work from there
[05:06:57] <jrm2k6> Segaja, the item is moved, it doesn't appears in the DOM
[05:07:55] <Neil> ntoll: Sounds good. How do I fire a callback?
[05:08:29] <Segaja> jrm2k6: i don't see the problem
[05:08:53] <jrm2k6> http://pastebin.com/USg3wrv6 Segaja try that please
[05:08:57] <jrm2k6> you'll see what is wrong
[05:09:11] <ntoll> Neil, you're using this right..? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/AutoComplete
[05:09:24] <Neil> ntoll: yes I believe so
[05:09:51] <Neil> ntoll: javascripts/jquery.autocomplete
[05:09:55] <Azrael_-> hi
[05:09:55] <ntoll> Neil, if so then you need to attach the function as in the second example in the "Plugins/AutoComplete/Events: list
[05:10:20] <ntoll> $("input").bind("activate.autocomplete", function(e, d) { /* Your stuff goes here*/})
[05:10:24] <Azrael_-> if i use jquery datepicker and want to put the background image into another path, how do i alter this for the script?
[05:10:46] <Neil> ntoll: Thanks. I'll give that a go now.
[05:11:00] <ntoll> Neil, np
[05:11:27] <vdclouis> could someone help me with a basic jQuery problem (concerning scrollLeft() and offset() )
[05:13:00] <jrm2k6> Segaja, have you tested the snippet I gave?
[05:13:17] <vdclouis> I'm making a horizontal scroll website. But I would like to somehow add some px's to the scrollLeft() property. Here's my code so far
[05:13:18] <vdclouis> http://jsfiddle.net/UXD6c/
[05:19:38] <jrm2k6> nobody?
[05:20:37] <ThiefMaster> ugh, reading code from the jquery team is so annoying.. i hate them for adding all this whitespace after ( and before )
[05:23:20] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have a non-jquery preferred way to do liquid tabs with images on both sides?
[05:23:41] <ravenzz> you need to do that in order to draw a thong ( Y )
[05:24:15] <jrm2k6> raah I'm so stuck http://pastebin.com/USg3wrv6
[05:25:19] <jeffsmykil> jrm2k6: what are you trying to do?
[05:25:28] <jeffsmykil> a fiddle would be better in this instance
[05:25:42] <ravenzz> what do you mean with "images on both sides"
[05:25:53] <jeffsmykil> ravens rounded on both sides
[05:25:58] <jeffsmykil> so the middle has a repeat-x
[05:26:03] <jeffsmykil> and the left and right are fixed width
[05:26:04] <jrm2k6> jeffsmykil, ok I wll give a fiddle
[05:26:37] <Zogot> The correcy way to append a var with more details? example var html = '<div>'; html =+ '<p>';
[05:26:38] <Zogot> ?
[05:26:49] <jrm2k6> I'm trying to move a li from onelist to another, in both way: I click an li in the first ul, it adds in the second one. I click on the same item, now in the second list, I want ti to be moved to the first list and so on
[05:27:08] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil uhm css?
[05:27:09] <jeffsmykil> you might need to use delegate
[05:27:20] <jeffsmykil> or live back in the day
[05:27:24] <jeffsmykil> ravenzz: well yeah
[05:27:31] <ravenzz> do you have any img so I can understand it better?
[05:27:34] <jeffsmykil> but it's an LI
[05:27:45] <ravenzz> my english is so horrible
[05:28:51] <jrm2k6> jeffsmykil, I've to use delegate?
[05:28:51] <jeffsmykil> ravenzz: if they weren't liquid I would just put a background image in the LI
[05:29:01] <jeffsmykil> i think so
[05:29:13] <jeffsmykil> because the click only applies to stuff that is there when the dom loads
[05:29:34] <jeffsmykil> so if it moves to a new place I *think* you need to use delegate to let it know
[05:29:44] <jeffsmykil> I'm not positibe though Id need a fiddle
[05:29:54] <jrm2k6> let me give you a fiddle :)
[05:30:01] <jeffsmykil> there are much better people to answer your question
[05:30:06] <jeffsmykil> im just trying to be helpful
[05:30:30] <jrm2k6> yes, and that's nice of you
[05:30:41] <beasty> indeed you're kind jeffsmykil :)
[05:32:02] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil image pliZ
[05:33:02] <jeffsmykil> it's a rounded tab with a left and right corner rounded
[05:33:31] <ravenzz> isn't border-radius ok?
[05:33:37] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately not
[05:33:40] <ravenzz> why?
[05:33:45] <jeffsmykil> they aren't all rounded perfect like that
[05:33:59] <ravenzz> that = images ?
[05:34:11] <jeffsmykil> and border radius isn't supported in IE < 9
[05:34:21] <ravenzz> there is css3 pie for ie
[05:34:27] <jeffsmykil> can't use it
[05:34:33] <ravenzz> why?
[05:34:33] <ravenzz> :D
[05:34:36] <jeffsmykil> lol
[05:34:45] <woozly> guys, how to get Object's members names?
[05:34:54] <jeffsmykil> because the company I work for does work for hospitals and they don't like that sort of thing
[05:34:56] <ravenzz> images are ugly
[05:35:15] <ravenzz> and old style
[05:35:22] <woozly> Object.variableOne, Object.DogName ... etc. how to get 'variableOne', 'DogName' and other object's variable's name?
[05:35:35] <jeffsmykil> [i]
[05:35:37] <jeffsmykil> woozly
[05:36:12] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil I would like to talk with them, just to understand why they don't like that sort of things
[05:36:19] <woozly> jeffsmykil, it will return me VALUE of variable
[05:36:24] <woozly> But I need to get variable name
[05:36:34] <jeffsmykil> oh
[05:36:35] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[05:36:46] <jeffsmykil> Don't know you will have to wait for much smarter people than I
[05:37:07] <beasty> $.each(object, function(key,value) { console.log(key); });
[05:37:50] <ravenzz> you could use $.map if you want to create a new array with those values
[05:37:52] <erichynds> woozly: if you only care about new browsers, Object.keys(object). otherwise: var keys = $.map(object, function(key){ return key; });
[05:37:54] <woozly> yeah, sorry
[05:38:07] <woozly> thanks!!!
[05:38:28] <ravenzz> erichynds is less lazy than me
[05:39:10] <jrm2k6> erichynds, http://jsfiddle.net/jrm2k6/tbJf9/
[05:39:14] <jeffsmykil> erichynds is the man
[05:39:38] <erichynds> no u !
[05:40:02] <Anime> i'm trying to load a bunch of images at once, is there a similar way to do it but without each load interfering with each other? - http://jsfiddle.net/rkrkh/9/
[05:40:20] <jrm2k6> oups
[05:40:32] <jeffsmykil> i guess I could use jquery to insert LIs before and after the actual tab
[05:40:36] <jeffsmykil> but that seems ugly
[05:40:45] <jrm2k6> jeffsmykil, concerning my li problem :http://jsfiddle.net/jrm2k6/tbJf9/
[05:41:43] <remysharp> q: can you use delegate with special events ($.event.special.MyEvent)? - it's not seeming to work for me (1.6.2)
[05:42:25] <risky_s> hi
[05:42:30] <jeffsmykil> looking jrm2k6
[05:42:35] <risky_s> how do I make a check all button with a checkbox
[05:42:46] <jrm2k6> thx!
[05:42:58] <risky_s> I am doing $(';checkbox').attr('checked', true);
[05:43:01] <risky_s> :*
[05:43:19] <jeffsmykil> jrm2k6: you are better off if you can bribe erichynds with breakfest foods to look at it though
[05:43:33] <jrm2k6> ahah
[05:43:53] <jrm2k6> I will look to find some food though
[05:43:53] <ajpiano> remysharp: i believe it is supposed to
[05:44:09] <avidal_> have a function create_dialog(ok_button_function) and i want to pass the function to be used for the OK button as an argument, how can i write this?
[05:44:13] * remysharp ajpiano: mocking example quickly
[05:44:20] <ajpiano> remysharp: if you can linger around in -dev today, you can probably get a better answer from dave
[05:44:38] <remysharp> ajpiano: is this channel any good for technical questions nowadays then?
[05:44:46] <jeffsmykil> jrm2k6: ajpiano is also smart and mostly patient
[05:45:00] <remysharp> ajpiano: I'm guess not, by your previous msg actually - so cheers, I'll head over there :)
[05:45:03] <ajpiano> remysharp: it's good for technical questions, but not from people who have been using the library for like 4 or 5 years
[05:45:03] <jrm2k6> I'm sure it is just a little problem, but for now i don't understand it
[05:45:15] * chee rs
[05:45:19] <ajpiano> remysharp: most like "is this a jquery bug" stuff happens in -dev
[05:45:24] <jeffsmykil> so you just want them to go back and forth between the ULs?
[05:45:31] <jrm2k6> exaclty
[05:46:01] <vdclouis> any big brain action on this one? http://jsfiddle.net/UXD6c/3/
[05:48:37] <Zogot> Whats the best way to count how many of a class exist in a parent?
[05:48:47] <jeffsmykil> zogot .length?
[05:48:58] <Zogot> I tried, but it keeps trying to .length on the object
[05:49:08] <Zogot> maybe im missing something
[05:50:17] <jeffsmykil> jrm2k6: this is the way you shouldn't do it
[05:50:18] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/tbJf9/1/
[05:50:20] <jeffsmykil> but it works now
[05:50:28] <jeffsmykil> and people will be able to tell you how to make it proper
[05:50:30] <jeffsmykil> live is obsolete
[05:50:34] <jeffsmykil> you use on or delegate now
[05:50:48] <jeffsmykil> zogot jsfiddle?
[05:50:53] <jeffsmykil> Zogot:
[05:51:00] <chee> Zogot: $('#parent .class').length     surely
[05:51:01] <jrm2k6> thx jeffsmykil
[05:51:21] <AdvoWork> if my code is setup like: <a class="parent" onclick="show_content('products_a');" id="products_a">Products</a><span></span><div id="products_div"> how can i get the div called products_div or whatever may be in that div under the li, if it already knows the id of the a (products_a)?   $('#products_div').slideToggle(); works, but i dont want to have to specify the actual div name
[05:51:50] <Zogot> chee, that wasn't working for me, wait il get a fiddle
[05:51:56] <chee> gross
[05:52:01] <chee> oh
[05:52:40] <jeffsmykil> jrm2k6: if you look in the documentation for live, it will direct you to the correct way to do it
[05:52:54] <jeffsmykil> or you could beg ajpiano or erichynds to help you
[05:53:05] <Zogot> chee: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/AVHU2/
[05:53:06] <jrm2k6> yep but live is obsolte
[05:53:09] <ajpiano> ajpiano is pretty busy at the moment
[05:53:17] <jrm2k6> i will look about on()
[05:53:23] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats what you need
[05:53:26] <jeffsmykil> i just cant help you with it
[05:53:40] <chee> so many databases to delete, so little time :3
[05:53:49] <Zogot> chee: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/AVHU2/1/ sorry added some html
[05:53:50] <erichynds> wat
[05:53:53] <jeffsmykil> rm chee!
[05:53:55] <jeffsmykil> ;)
[05:54:00] <ajpiano> chee true story ;)
[05:54:07] <chee> ajpiano: :D
[05:55:05] <erichynds> what's the question jrm2k6 ?
[05:55:43] <jrm2k6> erichynds, how to do that properly http://jsfiddle.net/tbJf9/1/
[05:57:19] <Zogot> Here, for anyone, http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/AVHU2/ the proper working example.  It doesn't give me how many of class='input' exist.
[05:58:38] <erichynds> jrm2k6: here's one way that's DRYer: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/tbJf9/2/
[05:59:33] <jrm2k6> erichynds, wowthanks, i'm checking it
[06:00:17] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: would you consider that code readable?
[06:00:37] <erichynds> i would
[06:00:53] <jeffsmykil> ok i wasnt sure
[06:00:56] <jeffsmykil> i cant read it
[06:00:58] <jeffsmykil> but im a newb
[06:01:19] <jeffsmykil> im just unfamiliar with some of the stuff you used
[06:01:27] <erichynds> http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/tbJf9/3/
[06:01:34] <erichynds> bit better
[06:02:53] <jeffsmykil> i think i understand
[06:05:22] <chee> Zogot: there is no .attributeHolder !
[06:06:27] <Neil> Would you expect this method to be escaping javascript content in the rendered message? http://pastie.org/private/ts0za2lgfbcqypaxwwjiya
[06:06:33] <chee> i meant to say, $('.attributeHolder') returns null !
[06:07:05] <chee> that's it i'm just going to get drunk. dogs shouldn't be allowed to die
[06:16:38] <karim> hi guys, I think I've found a bug with jquery .bind and custom events
[06:17:03] <karim> is this the expected behaviour: http://jsfiddle.net/khamidou/PuUjj/2/
[06:17:18] <karim> ?
[06:20:48] <jeffsmykil> If I have a long unordered list
[06:21:00] <jeffsmykil> and I want to prepend and append to a particular li
[06:21:02] <jeffsmykil> not in it
[06:21:04] <jeffsmykil> but ariound it
[06:21:11] <jeffsmykil> how should i go about that
[06:22:29] <ravenzz> do you mean wrap() ?
[06:22:38] <jeffsmykil> ooh there is a wrap?
[06:22:47] <jeffsmykil> i may
[06:22:50] <ravenzz> anyway only LI can be children of OL/UL
[06:22:59] <jeffsmykil> yes
[06:23:04] <jeffsmykil> so my list looks like this
[06:23:06] <ravenzz> so you can't wrap a li within an p
[06:23:14] <ravenzz> etc
[06:23:16] <quicksilver> perhaps jeffsmykil just wants .after()
[06:23:17] <jeffsmykil> <ul> <li> <li> </ul>
[06:23:34] <ravenzz> ok wrap then
[06:23:35] <quicksilver> have a browse at http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[06:23:36] <jeffsmykil> after may work
[06:23:47] <jeffsmykil> ty
[06:24:18] <jeffsmykil> i can use after with eq?
[06:24:28] <g0rd0n> lol
[06:24:32] <quicksilver> question doesn't make sense.
[06:24:36] <g0rd0n> is that plugin page guy in this channel?
[06:24:43] * g0rd0n throws lobsters
[06:24:47] <jeffsmykil> quicksilver: 	$("li").eq(1).before("<div class='activeTabLeft'></div>");
[06:25:09] <quicksilver> no, because "before" is a method of jQuery objects.
[06:25:17] <quicksilver> $("li").eq(1) is nto a jquery object, it's a DOM object
[06:25:23] <Eviltwin> quicksilver: Wrong
[06:25:28] <quicksilver> try: $("li:eq(1)").before(...)
[06:25:36] <Eviltwin> quicksilver: .get(i) produces a DOM element
[06:25:39] <quicksilver> ah
[06:25:42] <Eviltwin> .eq(i) produces a jQuery object
[06:25:44] <quicksilver> then, yes that will work fine :)
[06:25:45] <quicksilver> sorry.
[06:25:47] <jeffsmykil> so i can do it my way?
[06:25:50] <jeffsmykil> no worries
[06:25:57] <jeffsmykil> im the king of giving outwrong info
[06:26:26] <Eviltwin> You're trying to insert an element after the first element?
[06:26:27] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil ah remember that this http://pastie.org/2991276 if also invalid
[06:26:49] <ravenzz> is*
[06:26:49] <jeffsmykil> ravenzz: not dooing that
[06:26:54] <ravenzz> k k
[06:27:01] <jeffsmykil> im trying to add rounded corners to some tabs
[06:27:09] <jeffsmykil> and they are images
[06:27:17] <jeffsmykil> and they have to be liquid
[06:27:30] <jeffsmykil> and its asp code that is generating them
[06:27:33] <jeffsmykil> so i have to get tricky
[06:28:01] <ravenzz> <img><div/><img> =?
[06:28:18] <Eviltwin> When you do $("...").eq(x), the collection you get back will always have exactly 1 (or 0) elements in it
[06:28:25] <jeffsmykil> can I put an <img> inside an li
[06:28:27] <ravenzz> this sucks anyway
[06:28:32] <ravenzz> yes you can
[06:28:42] <jeffsmykil> that wont work
[06:28:44] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to find li's that are the 2nd one within their parent, you're probably looking for http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[06:29:35] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil tell them that you don't need that corner images at all. stop.
[06:29:50] <jeffsmykil> ravenzz: have yo uever worked for a company?
[06:29:50] <ravenzz> you are the front-end guy not they
[06:30:07] <jeffsmykil> we have the dreaded consultants dude
[06:30:09] <ravenzz> yes, they sucks
[06:31:02] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Have you looked at this? http://jquery.malsup.com/corner/
[06:31:06] <jeffsmykil> they gave me a compsite
[06:31:08] <jeffsmykil> I have to make it
[06:31:12] <ravenzz> he is a moron if obligate you to use images for corners
[06:32:30] <jeffsmykil> if i dont do it, they find someone who will
[06:32:36] <jeffsmykil> im not a contractor ravenzz
[06:32:56] <AdvoWork> if my code is setup like: <a class="parent" onclick="show_content('products_a');" id="products_a">Products</a><span></span><div id="products_div"> how can i get the div called products_div or whatever may be in that div under the li, if it already knows the id of the a (products_a)?   $('#products_div').slideToggle(); works, but i dont want to have to specify the actual div name
[06:33:13] <ravenzz> fucking idios devs. I worked on a project as front-end dev, and i told them. I'll give you the templates. so don't build this form using tables, and they don't care. jesus. so i left them, and i am not going to do something similar again
[06:33:46] <jeffsmykil> im not in a financial situation to have those kind of values regarding this work
[06:34:33] <Taar779> I would bring forward what is being done wrong and hope they change their ways
[06:35:04] <ravenzz> yes I understand, but it is silly. you are building a fluid layout, maybe responsive, and they want you to use images for corners
[06:35:45] <jeffsmykil> for the tabs yse
[06:35:50] <jeffsmykil> they swoop and what not
[06:35:57] <jeffsmykil> even if i could usee css 3
[06:36:06] <jeffsmykil> it wouldnt cut it for the design they came up with
[06:36:19] <ravenzz> Taar779 sometimes it is really hard to bring forward those kind of stuffs
[06:36:29] <jrm2k6> http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/tbJf9/3/  How could i remove the input with the same value of the li clicked from the form?
[06:37:05] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil for the love of god, use js then. At least you'll not have a crappy markup
[06:37:23] <jeffsmykil> i agree its not ideal
[06:37:28] <jeffsmykil> but what work situation is?
[06:37:37] <_thumper_> Hi. How can I add an attribute to an image by its file name?
[06:37:49] <_thumper_> For each image by that name
[06:38:05] <Pallet> I'm writing a widget type thing that will in effect embed an iframe into a page, but I've got a question, is there anything better nowadays than iframes?
[06:38:19] <jeffsmykil> ajax?
[06:38:51] <ravenzz> _thumper_ $('img[src$="foo.png"]').attr('foo', 'bar');
[06:39:51] <jeffsmykil> Pallet: ajax?
[06:40:07] <_thumper_> Awesome, thanks alot
[06:40:19] <chrisinajar> Pallet: ajax.
[06:40:48] <chrisinajar> ravenzz: what's the $ do in that selector?
[06:41:31] <philosophically> trying to set a cookie for a query ui modal dialog, so that it shows only once, however, cookie is not being applied, modal dialog loads every time. I don't have any javascript errors, so i don't know what to do next. I pasted the relevant code here http://pastebin.com/2RfP3Vd4
[06:41:34] <Pallet> jeffsmykil, chrisinajar would you simply create a DIV of the required size, then afax load the content into it ?
[06:41:44] <jeffsmykil> that;s what i would do
[06:42:02] <chrisinajar> Pallet: no
[06:42:07] <Pallet> ah ok
[06:42:10] <Pallet> what then ?
[06:42:11] <jeffsmykil> but im a moron
[06:42:17] <Pallet> me too ;)
[06:42:20] <chrisinajar> Pallet: i would, in js, build the widget from a div and get only the data via ajax (in json encoding)
[06:42:20] <chee> \:D/
[06:42:44] <jeffsmykil> I fail to see the diference...
[06:42:51] <chrisinajar> Pallet: so you build the widget, then fill in the data via ajax. this allows updating the data without rebuilding the widget, as well.
[06:42:53] <jeffsmykil> i assumed that's what he meant
[06:42:55] <Pallet> isn't that basically the same
[06:43:08] <Pallet> yeh, for sure
[06:43:08] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: the widget's dom shouldn't be fetched, that should be created in js
[06:43:11] <shwaiil> Q: I'm doing  a foreach loop for $(my input of type checkbox) how to change checkbox to false ? Thanks for looking!
[06:43:16] <Pallet> cool, thanks
[06:44:16] <Pallet> next question, my widget will have 3 default widths, so they can fit into customers pages, ie the content area, what sizes should I offer ?
[06:44:27] <chrisinajar> shwaiil: $(".myCheckbox").prop("checked", true);
[06:44:38] <jeffsmykil> pallet that depends on the use for them doesn't it?
[06:44:41] <jeffsmykil> are they ads?
[06:44:45] <jeffsmykil> ads come in standard sizes
[06:44:49] <shwaiil> chrisinajar:  thanks for looking. If not using .prop, what else could I do ?
[06:44:58] <chrisinajar> shwaiil: why?
[06:45:06] <chrisinajar> shwaiil: $('.myCheckbox').attr('checked','checked')
[06:45:08] <Pallet> jeffsmykil, no they will actually almost be full pages
[06:45:13] <shwaiil> chrisinajar: just wondering :)
[06:45:17] <Pallet> ie take up an entire content area
[06:45:22] <shwaiil> chrisinajar: thanks
[06:45:43] <chrisinajar> shwaiil: or rawDomObj.checked = false;
[06:46:00] <chrisinajar> shwaiil: i just googled "jquery checkbox checked" to get all of those, all from the 2nd hit
[06:46:03] <jeffsmykil> does hasClass return 0 and -1?
[06:46:12] <chrisinajar> jefflembeck: try it and see!
[06:47:30] <jeffsmykil> how do you type in there?
[06:47:33] <jeffsmykil> doesn't it get cramped?
[06:47:42] <chrisinajar> it's a big jar
[06:47:47] <jeffsmykil> makes sense
[06:48:14] <jeffsmykil> like a canner's jar?
[06:48:30] <chrisinajar> i just checked to see if the junior developer here was doing anything with checkboxes, because his name is jeff, and he's bad at jquery :P
[06:48:34] <chrisinajar> nope, you're not sitting behind me.
[06:48:48] <jeffsmykil> im not doing anything with checkboxes :-p
[06:48:56] <chrisinajar> oh yeah, that was that other guy
[06:48:56] <jrm2k6> http://jsfiddle.net/jrm2k6/JzCAM/ The remove doesn't work, I don't know why
[06:49:00] <chrisinajar> i have no idea why you're here.
[06:49:10] <jeffsmykil> and if you were sitting in front of me Id shoot you in the back of the head with my nerf gun
[06:49:22] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: well, it's commented out..
[06:49:28] <jrm2k6> yep but
[06:49:37] <jrm2k6> it you uncomment it :)
[06:49:41] <jrm2k6> it doesn't work :)
[06:51:20] * jeffsmykil pops chrisinajar  in the back of the head
[06:51:50] <chrisinajar> one time he did throw a ball at the back of my head to get my attention
[06:51:52] <chrisinajar> big headphones.
[06:52:01] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: trying to figure out what the fuck you're doing here
[06:52:04] <jeffsmykil> typical engineer
[06:52:09] <jeffsmykil> anti social
[06:53:02] <jrm2k6> hm, I click on a li, I add an input supposed to a form if the li is moved to the first list to the second, and the input is removed of the form if the li clicked is moved from list2 to list1
[06:53:12] <chrisinajar> not anti-social, just way too ADD to work with sounds around me :)
[06:53:46] <jeffsmykil> SQUIREL
[06:54:08] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: how do you make it do anything? I've only gotten it to do anything once.....
[06:54:51] <chrisinajar> ah, there are errors...
[06:54:52] <chrisinajar> that's why..
[06:55:07] <jrm2k6> yeah that's why I've uncommented the remove part
[06:55:13] <jrm2k6> without it it works well
[06:55:51] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: you should probably fix your syntax errors before posting things :P
[06:56:05] <jrm2k6> chrisinajar, without it works well no?
[06:56:17] <chrisinajar> new error
[06:56:22] <chrisinajar> no method "replace"
[06:56:33] <jrm2k6> replace?
[06:58:13] <chrisinajar> Object [object Object] has no method 'replace'
[06:58:19] <chrisinajar> that's what i get when i run your code
[06:58:23] <chrisinajar> trying to figure out why..
[06:58:25] <jeffsmykil> he might not be using firebug
[06:58:34] <jeffsmykil> link him to the slide show
[06:58:46] <chrisinajar> oh
[06:58:48] <chrisinajar> i get it..
[06:59:15] <jrm2k6> I don't use firebug with jsfiddle
[06:59:16] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: you have syntax errors and also clearly didn't read any api docs as you're using this function totally wrong
[06:59:27] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: i highly recommend reading into your errors first :P
[06:59:44] <chrisinajar> once i fixed your basic errors it started working perfectly
[07:00:23] <jrm2k6> there is a console on jfiddle?
[07:00:30] <chrisinajar> no, i just press f12
[07:00:41] <jrm2k6> oh ok
[07:00:45] <chrisinajar> seeing errors is more important than ANYTHING in programming.
[07:00:47] <chrisinajar> ANY
[07:00:48] <chrisinajar> THING
[07:00:51] <jeffsmykil> man that always just turns my volume up ;)
[07:01:04] <jrm2k6> I was unaware firebug was 'linked' to firebug
[07:01:09] <jrm2k6> euh
[07:01:10] <jrm2k6> jsfiddle
[07:01:13] <chrisinajar> it's not
[07:01:17] <chrisinajar> you're using a browser, right?
[07:01:45] <chrisinajar> if so, then firebug works.
[07:02:21] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: anyway, you need to use the + character to concat strings together, and you need to use the remove function the way it's described in the documentation
[07:03:15] <jrm2k6> omg yes I forgot one '+'
[07:03:41] <chrisinajar> indeedy, using your debugging tools is very helpful :)
[07:03:57] <jrm2k6> ok remove without argument remove element itself
[07:03:58] <chrisinajar> and replace expects a selector, not an object, as stated on the documentation
[07:04:04] <chrisinajar> er, remove
[07:04:06] <chrisinajar> not replace
[07:04:26] <chrisinajar> ".remove( [selector] )"
[07:04:28] <jrm2k6> ok still not awake
[07:04:42] <chrisinajar> drink a red bull or start going to bed early then :P
[07:04:57] <jrm2k6> one of my biggest default, not enough working with documentation
[07:05:03] <jrm2k6> ahahah finals time, no time to sleep
[07:05:21] <chrisinajar> ah, you're a student, that explains the lack of using documentation
[07:05:44] <jrm2k6> yep
[07:05:53] <chrisinajar> the unfortunate reality of programming is that it requires an incredible amount of research and reading.
[07:06:10] <jrm2k6> I agree with that but I'm not really fan of javascript stuffs
[07:06:16] <chrisinajar> if you try to cut corners and don't read docs, your code will fucking suck and people like me will give you endless shit at the workplace :P
[07:06:30] <jrm2k6> think it is too hard syntactically
[07:06:50] <chrisinajar> god i wish that was a valid excuse... "Sorry i took down the warehouse for an hour, i don't like Java."
[07:06:52] <rroelofs> the syntax is cake
[07:06:57] <jrm2k6> :D
[07:06:57] <chrisinajar> indeed
[07:07:01] <chrisinajar> syntax is trivial
[07:07:19] <jrm2k6> when you are into it
[07:07:25] <chrisinajar> not really
[07:07:28] <chrisinajar> takes like 6 seconds to learn
[07:07:37] <rroelofs> no, syntactically it is very like c
[07:07:51] <jrm2k6> lookat that from far $(blabla).click(function(){ ifhdiughfig});
[07:07:56] <rroelofs> that syntax represents like 80% of languages
[07:08:11] <rroelofs> that's not javascript
[07:08:17] <jrm2k6> that's jquery
[07:08:18] <rroelofs> that's jquery
[07:08:51] <chrisinajar> no, that's just an anonymous function...
[07:08:56] <chrisinajar> that's part of js
[07:09:00] <chrisinajar> jquery didn't invent that.
[07:09:08] <rroelofs> true
[07:09:28] <rroelofs> The point is, if you don't like learning, don't be a programmer
[07:09:29] <chrisinajar> i love anonymous functions so much...
[07:09:36] <rroelofs> :-)
[07:09:37] <chrisinajar> hahaha, oh god so true!!
[07:09:41] <chrisinajar> rroelofs++++++++++++
[07:09:54] <chrisinajar> i have to pound that into the junior here, he hates doing research
[07:10:00] <xjackbauer> hey everyone, i have a weird js issue. i'm rotating a div and the back element of it is only registering clicks on one side of the back div. here's an example (only chrome/safari) browsers. if you click the div at the bottom then the blue square it should only register clicks to the console if half of the div. http://www.webdevout.net/test?023
[07:10:36] <jrm2k6> Ahaha
[07:11:14] <jrm2k6> it is not I hate doing research. It is not clear in my mind that is the most powerful
[07:11:22] <jrm2k6> but with experience it will become true
[07:11:31] <chrisinajar> no, google.com does that for you
[07:11:39] <xckpd7> can you do a double not conditional? like if(!$cachedselector.length && !$anothercached.length) { }
[07:11:53] <chrisinajar> xckpd7: try it and see!
[07:12:01] <rroelofs> jrm2k6:  every language has strengths and use cases.  You will need to know several languages well
[07:12:04] <xckpd7> chrisinajar: already did it, having issues
[07:12:22] <chrisinajar> xckpd7: ok, what are your issues then. don't beat around the bush, just ask your question
[07:12:32] <xckpd7> chrisinajar: dude that is the question!
[07:12:41] <chrisinajar> xckpd7: yes.
[07:12:47] <chrisinajar> xckpd7: ok, now what's your issue?
[07:13:02] <jrm2k6> I totally agree rroelofs , I'm not saying I don't like to learn or do research. It is just at the first sight I don't really like javascript and jquery that's all
[07:13:06] <xckpd7> the syntax I used for doing it isn't working, even though both conditionals by themselves will work
[07:13:13] <xckpd7> chrisinajar: ^
[07:13:20] <xjackbauer> :jrm2k6 what language are u use too?
[07:13:23] <chrisinajar> xckpd7: define "isn't working"
[07:13:27] <rroelofs> xckpd7:   put up a sample on jsfiddle
[07:13:43] <xckpd7> chrisinajar: It's not processing the code in the middle of the brackets
[07:13:50] <chrisinajar> yes it is.
[07:13:53] <chrisinajar> you're just doing it wrong.
[07:13:55] <NoiseEee> xckpd7: you realize that the 'length' property exists for both cases, regardless whether any elements were found?
[07:13:57] <chrisinajar> paste your code
[07:14:11] <NoiseEee> xckpd7: you're interested in checking the VALUE of length
[07:14:16] <Flavius1924> can you tell me that site djfiddle
[07:14:19] <Flavius1924> or what was it ?
[07:14:22] <jrm2k6> C, java/android, python/django, php ..
[07:14:52] <chrisinajar> jrm2k6: try C++, i did that for work from age 19-23. so much fun, i fucking miss it.
[07:15:13] <jrm2k6> pointers  pouah
[07:15:16] <jrm2k6> :D
[07:15:18] <chrisinajar> <3 pointers
[07:15:20] <chrisinajar> i miss them SO MUCH
[07:15:26] <jrm2k6> irony?
[07:15:31] <rroelofs> Flavius1924: http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:15:36] <chrisinajar> nope, they're amazing and incredibly useful
[07:16:02] <jrm2k6> I agree for the useful, but the mechanism is sometimes the best poison ever
[07:16:32] <chrisinajar> indeed you can't be sloppy, it's not a language for the casual programmer
[07:16:34] <rroelofs> chrisinajar: what can you do with the that you can't do without?
[07:16:40] <chrisinajar> especially when you start dealing with threads x.x
[07:17:21] <chrisinajar> rroelofs: awesome buffer management to avoid allocating new memory, and reading/writing from complex binary buffers is super easy, and there's lots of great performance optimizations you can do
[07:17:25] <chrisinajar> but most importantly
[07:17:36] <chrisinajar> *((int*)0) = 1; // exit 1
[07:18:01] <rroelofs> That's useful! :-)
[07:18:12] <chrisinajar> i actually had a legitimate use for it once!
[07:18:30] <rroelofs> I'l grant you that handling memory yourself is more efficient for the machine, not for theprogrammer
[07:18:36] <chrisinajar> i had a #define exit(x) *((int*)0) = x;
[07:19:08] <chrisinajar> and operator overloading <3
[07:19:11] <chrisinajar> and typedefs
[07:19:17] <chrisinajar> oohhh templates!!!
[07:19:24] <chrisinajar> i miss them all, fuck java.
[07:19:39] <Peppr_> morning everyone. Question: anyone know a cross-browser safe method in jQuery to transition an element from one class another, that does not have the ugly flickering effect? And yes are very different so there change is rather large from a visual standpoint.
[07:19:45] <xckpd7> chrisinajar: the logic for the conditional was wrong.... that length stuff was just for an example... but yeah thanks
[07:19:48] <rroelofs> and you need them in a loosely typed language because ??
[07:20:02] <rroelofs> or are we straying into irony?
[07:20:27] <chrisinajar> comparing to java, no one actually develops in js
[07:20:30] <chrisinajar> it's a helper langauge
[07:20:53] <Rembane> Peppr_: Framebuffer!
[07:20:57] <rroelofs> that's not true.  I'm currently replacing an enterprise app in js
[07:21:02] <Rembane> Peppr_: Hide it first, make the transition, show it.
[07:21:05] <chrisinajar> actually i wrote an engine once in C++ that used JS as it's game logic, then wrote a game in JS. It used the webkit js interpreter so it was awesome.
[07:21:41] <chrisinajar> rroelofs: what's it do? business logic in js seems silly to me. How's it structured?
[07:21:43] <rroelofs> Peppr_:  you could also use animate
[07:21:50] <Peppr_> Rembane: thanks! I was thinking that way, but in jQuery and ie6 and ie7 things just get clunky.
[07:22:02] <Rembane> Peppr_: Oh. Dang.
[07:22:10] <Genesis2001> x:
[07:22:22] <ajpiano> Peppr_: we have that in jqueryui
[07:22:33] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/switchClass/
[07:22:56] <chrisinajar> ajpiano: wow, that's really cool......
[07:23:07] <rroelofs> chrisinajar:  the back end is in php, but all it really does is send/receive data to the front end.
[07:23:17] <Peppr_> ajpiano: That was the method I was using just recently, but the effects were not as smooth as I had hoped.
[07:23:28] * ajpiano hands Peppr_ some sandpaper
[07:23:36] <Peppr_> lol, nice touch
[07:24:16] <rroelofs> chrisinajar: I'm using backbone js as my mvc
[07:24:23] <Rembane> Backbone.js <3
[07:24:32] <ajpiano> Peppr_: seriously though... if you're expecting amazing JS perf transitioning multiple style properties over time in ie6
[07:24:45] <ajpiano> you probably need to retune your expectations
[07:25:06] <ajpiano> ie6 users are not used to a glitz-n-glam experience
[07:25:19] <chrisinajar> rroelofs: is that a server side js for mvc?
[07:25:41] <ajpiano> backbone is clientside "mvc"
[07:25:42] <Peppr_> I hear ajpiano, but ironically it behaves nicely in the ie6 and up world. It is the firefox and chrome that are clunky.
[07:25:42] <chrisinajar> ie6 also only makes up like 1% of the internet now... stop making applications for it...
[07:25:48] <Mkop> what do you mean? ie6 was the peak of browser UX... it's been all downhill from there
[07:25:52] <necromancer> hi guys
[07:26:30] <necromancer> i'm trying to change <input type> from "text" to "password", and since jQuery won't let me I've managed to do it with the DOM. is this safe?
[07:26:39] <Lichurec> Hi
[07:26:43] <ajpiano> necromancer: you can't change an input type cross-browser
[07:26:47] <ajpiano> so we block you from doing it in jquery
[07:27:02] <ajpiano> if you do it in pure dom, congrats, you just wrote some code that won't work in all browsers :/
[07:27:09] <chrisinajar> wow, i didn't know that..
[07:27:15] <_thumper_> $('img[src$=' + shared_image + '"]').attr('title', 'Shared');
[07:27:15] <necromancer> ajpiano: by "all browsers", what version of IE do you mean? ;)
[07:27:18] <rroelofs> chrisinajar: yes, express is the first that comes to mine
[07:27:19] <necromancer> or is it all of them?
[07:27:19] <chrisinajar> lemme guess: Doesn't work in ie? :P
[07:27:22] <_thumper_> ^^ What is wrong with that, its crashing the browser
[07:27:36] <Lichurec> Is there any specific reason why jQ can not return a full css property like $(foo).css('padding') and instead we need to ask for every single variation of this property?
[07:27:44] <rroelofs> I didn't do the backend in js because I thought it would freak out the rest of my team
[07:27:55] <chrisinajar> yasrsly
[07:28:09] <necromancer> ajpiano: i know it was to solve a problem with early IEs
[07:28:14] <chrisinajar> Lichurec: because there are 4 values
[07:28:18] <necromancer> but i wasn't sure if 8 & 9 suffer from this
[07:28:26] <ajpiano> necromancer: 6 and 7 at least, not sure if it's a problem in 8 or 9
[07:28:41] <necromancer> ajpiano: damn. i was hoping you'd say just 5.5 and 6 :)
[07:28:41] <Lichurec> chrisinajar: so? there MAY be 4 values; and when asking for padding-left it may return a string containing this particular value
[07:28:47] <necromancer> because i don't support those browsers on this project
[07:28:54] <necromancer> so writing non-compatible code would be fne
[07:28:55] <Lichurec> \why can't it return a set of values while asking for generic 'padding'?
[07:28:55] <necromancer> fine*
[07:28:57] <chrisinajar> Lichurec: write me a function that returns 4 values.
[07:29:18] <Lichurec> chrisinajar: it's a string
[07:29:31] <rroelofs> or it could be an array or an object
[07:29:32] <ajpiano> Lichurec: there isn't such a thing as "padding," iirc
[07:29:34] <necromancer> Lichurec: it would severely limit your use of that property in JS
[07:29:41] <necromancer> yeah it's a shorthand
[07:29:54] <ajpiano> css allows you to write the shorthand but they are separate properties
[07:30:40] <Lichurec> ajpiano:  I know that. the point; it's easy to return a shorthand representative of all values
[07:31:34] <ajpiano> Lichurec: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4295
[07:31:53] <necromancer> Lichurec: if you REALLY want it in there just code it and submit a pull request. but you're also gonna need to code all the shorthand variations of it like when you do padding: 'x x x' or padding: 'x x' or even padding: 'x'
[07:31:58] <ajpiano> it's easy to say that it's easy :)
[07:32:07] <necromancer> Lichurec: it
[07:32:08] <ajpiano> actually doing it, seems considerably less so
[07:32:26] <butch128> Could anyone shed some insight on how jquerys position({ of: }) works?  Does it do more than just loop through and get offsetParent, offsetLeft etc?  I need essentially duplicate it's behaviour, but cannot so far.  Does it set relative to elements?
[07:32:28] <chrisinajar> Lichurec: just add your own, adding functions to jquery is crazy easy
[07:32:30] <necromancer> isn't cheap (on memory) to parse a string every time you set .css(), especially if you have other things going on or it's an animation
[07:32:41] <Mkop> gettter: elem.css('padding',false,'variation_33')
[07:32:42] <Lichurec> necromancer: I might. but i would still be "ok" if asking for generic 'padding' would return a set of all four values
[07:32:46] <Lichurec> ieven if they all repeat
[07:33:06] <chrisinajar> Lichurec: write a 4 line function that does that for you, then....
[07:33:12] <ajpiano> Lichurec: read the ticket  i just linked you too, it looks like ther's a csshook for it
[07:33:13] <necromancer> Lichurec: but then you have to code the ability to modify 'padding', you can't just code .css() to return the property and not set it
[07:33:21] <ajpiano> Lichurec: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/marginpadding.js
[07:33:27] <necromancer> it's not quite as easy as you think
[07:34:20] <mumin-kun> hey! any way to read just the last 20 lines from a text file?
[07:34:28] <Lichurec> ajpiano: I am, right now
[07:34:29] <ajpiano> necromancer: like most things, it's a feature that's a lot easier as an enlish sentence than as actual code
[07:34:37] <necromancer> yup
[07:34:42] <necromancer> mumin-kun: not with javascript
[07:34:56] <necromancer> mumin-kun: JS can't access the filesystem
[07:34:59] <ajpiano> not with client-side javascript :p
[07:35:02] <necromancer> oh yeah hehe
[07:35:12] <necromancer> good old commonjs
[07:35:17] <mumin-kun> damn
[07:35:22] <necromancer> their slogan should just be "The Python of JavaScript"
[07:35:28] <Mkop> unless he means the last 20 lines from a text-file fetched via AJAX....
[07:35:40] <mumin-kun> that would work
[07:35:45] <necromancer> Mkop: i guess. you could .split('\n') right?
[07:36:00] <necromancer> then take the .length of that array - 21 and you're good ot go
[07:36:02] <Mkop> that means you'll be downloading the entire file and then only displaying the last bit
[07:36:06] <dr0id> or let the swerver side lang read the last 20 lines and spit json violently
[07:36:06] <johnline3> http://johnline.bastage.net/dev/portfolio/ any ideas on why my zoomboxes arent working?
[07:36:07] <mumin-kun> necromancer: thx!
[07:36:48] <Mkop> mumin-kun: if you can do it server side, that is probably a better solution
[07:37:18] <mumin-kun> allright, thx
[07:51:33] <Coekgod> I am trying to make my plugin ready for the new plugin system, but I don't understand something about "package.json", should the "files" field include the minified files or the unminified files?
[07:53:25] <ajpiano> Coekgod: link to whichever files you want to have downloadable
[07:54:02] <Coekgod> ajpiano: ok, thanks
[07:55:31] <ajpiano> Coekgod: i think it's preferable to have the unminified (source) only
[07:55:57] <Mkop> why?
[07:55:59] <ajpiano> we're actually going to be linking people to the github zips
[07:56:27] <Coekgod> oh
[07:56:28] <ajpiano> Mkop: because you don't want to keep built output - which is all a minifed file is - inside of source control
[07:56:48] <dr0id> 934 people .. hmm.. jquery has become popular now
[07:57:05] <Mkop> how do you envision the work flow of a plugin consumer?
[07:57:06] <Coekgod> I guess I am going to include both versions
[07:57:34] <ajpiano> Mkop: there are so many different things people do
[07:57:47] <ajpiano> but more and more people are moving to have their own minification/concat step in place
[07:58:01] <ajpiano> and you rarely want to be feeding minified code into a minifier
[07:58:02] <Coekgod> since I am not expecting every plugin user to build it on his own, but I also want the source to be available
[07:58:19] <ajpiano> but... it's up to you, if you want to included minifed, you can
[07:58:30] <Mkop> my current work flow is download zip containing jquery-foo.1.3.js and jquery-foo.1.3.min.js, put them in my js/ folder, and then point my code to them. I imagine that with this method I should be able to have git subrepos (or whatever they're called in the git world), but I would like to be able to check out the minified version via git
[07:58:49] <Mkop> your point about not including build output in SCM is valid, but that's my perspective as a consumer
[08:05:45] <Zogot> hmm, can anyone tell me why this isn't working.  Doesn't have html yet
[08:05:46] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/TWcG7/
[08:05:53] <Zogot> il put it on there in a sec
[08:06:23] <Zogot> Oh, sorry, the bit that isn't working is the on for the removeAttributes class
[08:08:37] <Mkop> Zogot: the point of jsfiddle is to provide a working example. without html this is useless (sorry for the bluntness)
[08:09:38] <Zogot> Aye, was in the process of copying it in and setting to base, so the url will still work, when I just realised the solution :)
[08:09:45] <Zogot> had the .on statement backwards
[08:10:29] <Logikos_> hi, i'm wondering if someone could recomend a good lightbox which will work with images, flash, youtube, etc .. i used to use mediabox but it requires mootools which i suspect is conflicting with jquery
[08:10:57] <arena> Hi everyone. I need help with this piece of code. I've almost got it working but I need that little oomph: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[08:12:22] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/TWcG7/ working example up now :).  If you see a better way to structure it, ive love to hear :)
[08:15:55] <Gorkyman> hey... I'm using jquery ui tabs... I'm loading tabs via ajax... is there a way to get the element on which I clicked for a tab?
[08:32:39] <CreativeDEV> if I wanna make my own js library, whats better? if    $("#id").append(DOMELEM).class()     .class() refers to the selected id or to the appended Node?
[08:33:05] <ajpiano> probably best not to have a method name that's a reserved word
[08:33:22] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Do you mean your own library that looks a lot like jQuery but isn't jQUery?
[08:33:49] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: not really my own js library, but not jquery
[08:33:57] <CreativeDEV> shouldn't look like jquery
[08:34:10] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Do you understand how jQuery has .append and .appendTo?
[08:34:11] <CreativeDEV> so better use addClass()?
[08:34:42] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: I looked at jquery 1.0 to understand how to make a js library
[08:35:02] <Eviltwin> There's also the jQuery stack
[08:35:17] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: what is this for?
[08:35:54] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $("#id").parent().append("<div/>") refers to in jQuery?
[08:36:05] <xckpd7> question: on my site I have a repeatable 'module'... a set of html... this  particular one is a small newsletter sign up. It appears on multiple parts of  the site, and it would be nice if I could encapsulate javascript that I have to
[08:36:25] <xckpd7>  run on it, inside of it so I don't have to define it at the top level of my site
[08:36:54] <xckpd7> so I'm wondering what would work best (jQuery plugin, regular function, jQuery widget) and how I would implement it. Any ideas?
[08:37:03] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: document.getElementsById(ID).parentNode.appendChild?
[08:37:19] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: What does the collection at the end refer to?
[08:38:03] <CreativeDEV> to the jQuery Object?
[08:38:13] <Eviltwin> Nevermind
[08:38:56] <CreativeDEV> so? don't know if i understand your question^^
[08:39:00] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Can you explain a little further?
[08:39:27] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: jQuery objects contain elements
[08:39:40] <Eviltwin> My question was what elements would be in the object at the end
[08:40:04] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: now not really^^
[08:40:06] <Eviltwin> Saying "it returns a jQuery object" is pretty much as generic as saying "it returns"
[08:40:08] <CreativeDEV> *no
[08:40:31] <CreativeDEV> I think jQuery[0]?
[08:40:34] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I want to insert blocks of html onto different pages, and I want javascript to run on them on document ready, but I want the code telling it to initialize on document.ready inside the module itself (well the bulk of the code can be external, but actually initializing it I want to be on document ready)
[08:40:35] <Eviltwin> .....
[08:40:52] <CreativeDEV> wait i try it :D
[08:41:08] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Again, every non-empty jQuery object has a [0] element
[08:41:08] <big_swimmer> I'm havign trouble using jquery ui sortable and getting a mouseover or mouseleave event to trigger during the drag. are there any good solutions to this problem
[08:41:16] <Eviltwin> Still doesn't say anything about what that element is
[08:41:22] <CreativeDEV> yeah^^
[08:41:35] <Eviltwin> I'm asking you what that element is
[08:41:47] <CreativeDEV> ok thats a dom-element
[08:42:10] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Yeah, sounding something like a UI widget
[08:43:48] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Nothing you've said so far comes close to distinguishing between $("#foo") and $("#bar")
[08:44:06] <Eviltwin> I think you need to learn a little more about how jQuery works
[08:45:00] <CreativeDEV> so now ok that could probably be^^. but what is the right answer?
[08:45:07] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: it's like on sites I worked on, there is just a bunch of stuff initializing in the actual document... and it's very hard to maintain, and it's ugly and messy. UI widget seems like it would help, but I literally have no idea how to go about the implementation. I've seen people do templating stuff where they have a script tag inside of the html module that runs stuff... is that what I would do?
[08:46:25] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: If I recall, you do $.widget("widgetname",{...})
[08:46:33] <Eviltwin> And you define create and destroy methods (at least)
[08:46:45] <Eviltwin> As well as possibly a setOption
[08:46:59] <xckpd7> inside the actual html module itself?
[08:47:07] <Eviltwin> This would be JavaScript
[08:47:25] <Eviltwin> Widgets usually operate on like single elements
[08:47:41] <Eviltwin> And will fill out the rest of the HTML in the create
[08:48:14] <Eviltwin> Every time you do a .<mywidget>("<mymethod>",...) on the element
[08:48:17] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/NHxjk/
[08:48:48] <xckpd7> you see how the javascript is encapsulated  in the module, so anywhere I put it on the site, the javascript will operate on it?
[08:49:10] <Eviltwin> Oh, so this is like once per page?
[08:50:06] <Eviltwin> Generally the outermost wrapper on UI widgets is JavaScript
[08:50:15] <Eviltwin> And then inside that JavaScript they generate necessary additional HTML
[08:50:15] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: What's the right answer for your question?
[08:50:32] <xckpd7> Maybe, maybe not. But isn't this more efficient than trying to execute & manage working on elements for 500+ pages?
[08:50:33] <Eviltwin> As they are designed to embellish existing UI most times
[08:51:45] <Eviltwin> Not that they're limited to that
[08:51:51] <xckpd7> This is more philosophy and organization: wherever that module appears I want certain javascript to execute on it... I don't know when it's going to appear on the page, and having the server add conditionals for each page is awkward.... so I figure if the module executes itself...
[08:52:20] <xckpd7> then I don't have to throw everything for my site up in one area, making the page slower
[08:52:35] <Eviltwin> Well
[08:52:56] <Eviltwin> Actually dropping all the scripts to the bottom of the body will speed up initial load/render
[08:53:03] <daMaestro> is there any way to declare a xhr load call should refresh the full page and not just load the xhr content?
[08:53:40] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: so you're saying that for a site, all javascript should be just on all pages whether it's going to be used or not?
[08:54:02] <Eviltwin> Not at all
[08:54:29] <Eviltwin> Although there are sometimes reasons to include JavaScript you don't necessarily need on the current page
[08:54:32] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: then I'm confused...
[08:54:55] <Eviltwin> For example if you want future pages to load faster at the cost of the first page loading slower
[08:55:08] <Eviltwin> The JavaScript will be in the cache
[08:55:55] <Eviltwin> From the sound of it this is a server-side philosophy you're talking about
[08:56:55] <Eviltwin> Where your module is a (large-ish) block of HTML, associated JavaScript, and CSS possibly
[08:57:21] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I work on Django / Rails type applications which are very flexible... I notice that the jQuery on the sites I work on, look sorta like the code examples in the slides that are like "your code get's messy and unmanageable like this"
[08:57:57] <xckpd7> I figured "publishing" that a module exists from within the module itself and then the javascript running queries and actions made sense
[08:58:15] <Eviltwin> To optimize for initial render and speed while avoiding FOUC, you should have all of the CSS in the head and all of the JavaScript at the bottom of the body
[08:58:19] <xckpd7> but now I'm trying to figure out whether or not putting everything on a page (or heavily consolidating) makes sense
[08:58:54] <Eviltwin> But if your question is whether to include all JavaScript (including some stuff you only use on one page or two) on every page, the answer is no
[08:59:00] <Eviltwin> Unless it's small
[08:59:31] <big_swimmer> I'm havign trouble using jquery ui sortable and getting a mouseover or mouseleave event to trigger on a different element during the drag. are there any good solutions to this problem
[08:59:34] <xckpd7> Oh ok so for stuff that could potentially be used on the whole site, load that upfront
[08:59:36] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: ^
[08:59:59] <xckpd7> anything for specific pages let it be relegated to them
[09:00:03] <Eviltwin> There are two ways to optimize
[09:00:12] <mathi> hi
[09:00:18] <Eviltwin> One is to optimize caching
[09:00:33] <Eviltwin> By keeping the JavaScript mostly similar between pages
[09:00:50] <Eviltwin> Like one large file that represents what's used by like 90% of the pages or is relatively small and on most pages
[09:00:56] <mathi> should I always check wether at least one element  exists before calling a method? e.g. $(".myElement").hide()  is it safe to do this even though there wouldn't be any .myElement ?
[09:01:05] <Eviltwin> Then a few other JS files for large things used on only a few pages
[09:01:15] <quicksilver> mathi: yes.
[09:01:18] <Eviltwin> And you only include that on pages that need it
[09:01:28] <quicksilver> mathi: $(".myElement") will just be an empty jQuery object, which is fine.
[09:01:29] <Eviltwin> The other optimization is inlining
[09:01:36] <mathi> thank you!
[09:01:58] <Eviltwin> Small bits of script can be inserted directly into the HTML of the page
[09:02:06] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: so selectors are fast enough that I can afford to have 3 or 4 that are not on a page be included globally for the sake of caching?
[09:02:08] <Eviltwin> To avoid additional loads
[09:02:26] <CreativeDEV> When I want to study how jQuery works, where's the best documentation for that?
[09:02:43] <xckpd7> because at this point, running jQuery methods on stuff that doesn't exist is my only concern, as far as performance
[09:02:49] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: jquery-1.7.1.js
[09:03:03] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: but it's 5000 lines^!
[09:03:13] <CreativeDEV> sry 10000
[09:03:34] <big_swimmer> you can't run listeners for objects that dont exist with on/bind
[09:03:52] <Eviltwin> big_swimmer: What?
[09:04:45] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Have you read this? http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[09:07:12] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: yeah, I know most of it. I think you're just saying that having a couple of selectors running on pages which don't use them isn't too bad... though for my use case, I could always use .live or .delegate if I really needed to
[09:07:45] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize you were asking about the cost of selectors
[09:07:55] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: yeah!
[09:08:05] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I like the idea of caching a js file but each page is new html
[09:08:21] <Eviltwin> Unless you're running selectors over huge numbers of elements or running them thousands of times, it won't be anywhere near noticeable
[09:08:24] <xckpd7> so combining is sorta iffy in my head, so I figured you were saying that it's not so bad in the grand scheme of things
[09:09:07] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: ok I'm going full steam ahead with this plan.... thanks for all your help
[09:09:13] <Eviltwin> I believe loading code and not using it is relatively fast as long as it doesn't mean additional files
[09:09:28] <Eviltwin> When you add more and more files, it slows down
[09:09:36] <Eviltwin> Since the browser will only download so many in parallel
[09:09:48] <Eviltwin> And if any one of them lags, your whole site slows down
[09:09:53] <Eviltwin> That is if they're in the HTML
[09:09:55] <jrm2k6> Hey all, there is a way to make this snipped more generic, less redundant? http://jsfiddle.net/jrm2k6/JzCAM/19/
[09:09:56] <g0rd0n> how can i get the index of an associative array in an each loop?
[09:10:07] <Eviltwin> JS can be dynamically loaded after
[09:10:17] <Eviltwin> Which is a technique many sites take advantage of
[09:10:19] <g0rd0n> foo['bar'] = "something"; i want to get bar
[09:10:25] <Eviltwin> g0rd0n: An .each loop?
[09:10:36] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: $("#id").parent().append("<div />") refers to the parent of #id?
[09:10:42] <g0rd0n> Eviltwin: yes, i tried with the callback, but the index always gives me an integer
[09:10:46] <Eviltwin> g0rd0n: Did you see ?.each
[09:10:46] <bot-t> g0rd0n, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:10:56] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Yes
[09:11:34] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: ok that means my first question is answerd :), right
[09:11:42] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: It first makes a collection representing $("#id"), then .parent() changes the collection (and adds the previous one to the stack)
[09:11:45] <g0rd0n> Eviltwin: yes, so if it's supposed to work maybe i did some stupid error somewhere else... need to check
[09:11:53] <Eviltwin> Then .append() doesn't change the collection so it doesn't manipulate the stack
[09:12:09] <Eviltwin> You can add a .end() to the end of the chain
[09:12:12] <Eviltwin> Which will pop off the stack
[09:12:20] <Eviltwin> Getting you back to $("#id") (effectively)
[09:12:28] <Eviltwin> Without regenerating it
[09:12:40] <CreativeDEV> hmm, so the stack is a array?
[09:12:42] <Eviltwin> Like $("#id").parent().parent().end().end()
[09:12:53] <Eviltwin> Refers to the initial collection
[09:13:09] <g0rd0n> hehe my bad, sorry Eviltwin
[09:13:51] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: You should see ?.end
[09:13:51] <bot-t> CreativeDEV, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[09:13:55] <Eviltwin> Look at the uses there
[09:14:10] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: do you think a stack is much more important than controlling classes and attributes?
[09:14:49] <Eviltwin> I'm just pointing out a detail of how jQuery works
[09:15:08] <Eviltwin> Most operations return the same collection they operate on
[09:15:28] <Eviltwin> Like addClass, removeClass, etc
[09:15:42] <Eviltwin> append, prepend, insertAfter, insertBefore, etc
[09:15:53] <CreativeDEV> ok^^
[09:16:28] <Eviltwin> So $("#id").append("<div>").css("color","red") colors the element with id
[09:16:47] <Eviltwin> If you wanted to operate on the new DIV
[09:16:59] <CreativeDEV> use find?
[09:17:05] <Eviltwin> You can do $("<div>").appendTo("#id").css("color","red")
[09:17:19] <Eviltwin> Or $("#id").append($("<div>").css("color","red"))
[09:17:33] <Eviltwin> Using find is not really a good approach
[09:17:41] <Eviltwin> Your element can't necessarily be selected easily or quickly
[09:17:57] <CreativeDEV> ok^^
[09:19:41] <CreativeDEV> so does the stack contains jQuery Objects or only the selected object (jQuery[0])?
[09:21:11] <hariom> How to reset the default max-width in qTip2 plugin? I don't want to change in original css file. Is there any other way?
[09:22:00] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: Asking questions like those is why I suspect you don't really understand how jQuery works :P
[09:22:14] <Eviltwin> And I don't have time to explain it
[09:22:23] <CreativeDEV> yeah I understand^^
[09:23:06] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: and this is because there's only a documentation of how to use jQuery, but no one on how it jQuery works
[09:23:29] <xckpd7> CreativeDEV: huh?
[09:24:04] <CreativeDEV> xckpd7: did you found a documentation on how jQuery works?
[09:24:06] <Eviltwin> CreativeDEV: And now you know why I went to the source
[09:24:49] <hariom> How to reset the default max-width in qTip2 plugin? I don't want to change in original css file. Is there any other way?
[09:24:55] <CreativeDEV> Eviltwin: U read the whole source of jQuery 1.7.1?
[09:26:07] <xckpd7> CreativeDEV: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[09:27:08] <xckpd7> If you need a higher level of understanding, read the source like Eviltwin suggested
[09:27:44] <ghankstef> so I have a kind of chicken egg problem. I  am  making a facebook style friend chat  wit node js  on backend.  In this app  I am limiting  users to one chat at a time.  the dom object where chat occurs  has a class of  .currentChat.  In some situations,  a  user can be closing a chat almost at the same time as another is initiated.  So the close a chat   .currentChat  is fadedOut and removed  but as you may have guessed, this creates  
[09:28:31] <NoiseEee> CreativeDEV: also http://simonwillison.net/2007/aug/15/jquery/
[09:29:01] <CreativeDEV> xckpd7: yeah I do it in parts, but not the 1.7.1, because it's to much code and there are to many function calls (JQuery.access, etc.) and this functions are at the middle or bottom
[09:30:14] <xckpd7> Ok well there are many tutorials on the site, click on the tutorials button at the top
[09:30:39] <xckpd7> jQuery documentation there is english though, don't know if I can help there
[09:30:40] <mathi> I want to call a method "initDayView();", but only if it exists, how can I check if a method exists ?
[09:31:26] <ghankstef> mathi:  http://www.idealog.us/2007/02/check_if_a_java.html
[09:36:01] <jrm2k6> why my fadeIn doesn't work in $(this).appendTo(destList).fadeIn();

[09:40:02] <coachz> Are there any jquery plugins to "normalize" a web page across multiple browsers ?  Something that removes defaults styles and applies a common style/font set ?
[09:40:36] <shesek> coachz, not everything has to be jQuery-related... look up a reset.css file
[09:40:58] <coachz> shesek, ok how about a default grid system too ?
[09:42:14] <freeed> coachz, just use the basic css reset at the top of your css file: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
[09:42:48] <freeed> If your original design was not crafted to a grid in photoshop, then a css gird won't help you at all. They are just bloat for those that don't design imho
[09:43:22] <ravenzz> don't reset. http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/
[09:43:22] <coachz> ok i see, so just layout a simple html grid manually ?
[09:43:53] <freeed> ravenzz.. very cool. thanks for the link :)
[09:43:56] <coachz> thanks, normalize looks like what i was wanting
[09:44:17] <coachz> ravenzz, do you use that ?
[09:44:30] <ravenzz> yes
[09:44:38] <coachz> works nicely ?
[09:44:58] <ravenzz> like a charm
[09:45:26] <coachz> cool, and for a basic grid layout i just do it manually with divs ?
[09:46:00] <ravenzz> uhm well it depends upon the project
[09:46:04] <ravenzz> how complex is it?
[09:46:24] <coachz> i'm coming from yui and wondering about any "defaults" that make sense for a new project
[09:46:55] <ravenzz> uhm you can start a new project from html5boilerplate.com
[09:47:20] <ravenzz> there are also tips on grid systems and other suffs into the docs
[09:47:24] <coachz> that site appeared a bit too intense using apache configs and such
[09:47:34] <coachz> seemed like possibly overkill
[09:47:58] <ravenzz> you can strip whatever you don't need
[09:48:16] <coachz> do you use html5boilerplate code ?
[09:49:43] <ravenzz> yes, you can customize it on your needs
[09:49:55] <jrm2k6> ghankstef, sorry just coming back
[09:50:00] <coachz> ok thx
[09:50:13] <jrm2k6> yes it is appended but the fadeIn doesn't work
[09:50:31] <ghankstef> jrm2k6:    IS  IT HIDDEN BY DEFAULT  ,   DOES  .SHOW()  WORK?
[09:50:37] <ghankstef> whoops  sorry
[09:50:40] <jrm2k6> :D
[09:50:42] <ghankstef> didn't mean to all caps
[09:50:49] <jedimind> WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME
[09:51:07] <ghankstef> was  accident   my  apologies   jedimind
[09:51:53] <ravenzz> bad tab for jerk
[09:52:22] <jrm2k6> ghankstef, what do you mean by if .show work? I see the item appended appears on the targeted list so
[09:53:18] <ghankstef> jrm2k6:    .show    in lieu  of  fadeIn()     -  ok    so maybe it is showing by default  so  you need to make  it   hidden at first  perhaps?
[09:53:30] <jrm2k6> hm ok
[09:53:33] <jrm2k6> let me try
[09:53:35] <ghankstef> jrm2k6:   so it get added to DOM   but  is hidden  thne fadeIn
[09:54:24] <jrm2k6> ghankstef, ok it works
[09:54:25] <jrm2k6> thanks
[09:54:28] <ghankstef> cool

[10:22:04] <big_swimmer> has anyone tried to read through eloquent javascript. i'm loving it so far
[10:23:03] <Jayflux> big_swimmer eloquent javascript? that a book or something lol
[10:23:10] <big_swimmer> Jayflux: yah
[10:23:17] <Jayflux> nope then
[10:23:34] <big_swimmer> http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:23:54] <Jayflux> thanks, think ive seen this before
[10:23:55] <big_swimmer> i didn't realize how much of javascript i didn't know about
[10:26:34] <big_swimmer> I'm trying to figure out how to detect which object is picked up and where it's dropped using jqueryui sortable, has anyone done such a thing before, i'm having trouble finding a solution
[10:30:36] <techouse> how do i stop a function from executing if a condition is met?
[10:31:23] <Zerxer> if(condition) return;
[10:32:12] <techouse> yea, that...but problem is i kinda have to mix .hover with .focus and .focusout
[10:32:28] <techouse> and well, if .focus is met then .hover should be terminated
[10:32:59] <techouse> and if .focusout is met then .hover should continue
[10:33:53] <techouse> probably something in combo with .queue

[10:44:21] <thinkclay> what's the best way to have UI autocomplete search through multi-word labels? I currently have a contact list that I want to autocomplete on First Name, Last Name or Email but all in one field.
[10:49:03] <M4d3L> hi. how I test if an object exist?   if I do if ($("#myid")){}  it return me always true if the <div id="myid"> exist or not
[10:49:57] <Kilian-> are there any estimates how long it takes until a post in the forum gets reviewed?
[10:50:01] <erichynds> M4d3L: test the length property

[10:53:10] <andreip> working on getting a div to scroll through touch gestures on an ipad. trying to implement iscroll4 but haven't had a lot of luck yet
[10:55:18] <andreip> something similar to this http://cubiq.org/dropbox/iscroll4/examples/carousel/
[11:01:07] <big_swimmer> how can i check if two jquery items refer to the same dom
[11:03:05] <ajpiano> big_swimmer: you can compare dom elements for equality
[11:03:13] <ajpiano> but not jquery objects
[11:03:34] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide27
[11:03:36] <big_swimmer> ajpiano: how so?  $(this) != $(...)
[11:04:00] <big_swimmer> crazy awesome
[11:04:02] <big_swimmer> thanks
[11:05:48] <mathi> hi
[11:08:30] <mathi> I'm doing some javascript when a user selects an element in a dropdown: $('select#type').change(function() { /*some JS*/}   the problem is that the selected element is displayed for 1-2 seconds before updating the select element. Is is possible to immediately telle the dropdown to select the element and then process the JS ?
[11:08:51] <Zogot> OK, I have this, but I just realised an issue, when deleting a group, it can lead to have duplicate numbers.  What does anyone think is the best solution? http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/7f8EZ/
[11:09:30] <mathi> I mean that the dropdown (select elemnt) looks like "freezing" fro 1 to 2 seconds, because first the JS in .change(function(){...}); is executed
[11:10:29] <Zogot> Theres 2 selects>
[11:10:30] <Zogot> ?
[11:10:40] <mathi> only one <select>, why ?
[11:11:05] <Zogot>   the problem is that the selected element is displayed for 1-2 seconds before updating the select element. I dont quite understand?  What exactly is happening in the .change
[11:11:29] <ragas> $('h3').hide; doesnt hide my h3.?
[11:11:41] <Zogot> .hide()?
[11:11:56] <mathi> in .change() I execute Javascript code, and the dropdown is not rendered until the JS is executed
[11:12:04] <ragas> oh. thatnks. duh.
[11:12:20] <mathi> I was wondering if it's possible to specify to first render the dropdown element, and then execute the JS
[11:12:22] <Zogot> mathi: then have a document.ready that runs the function to load the dropdown to start with
[11:12:31] <mathi> the dropdown is loaded
[11:12:38] <Zogot> and the dropdown is not rendered until the JS is executed?
[11:12:39] <mathi> it's not dynamic
[11:12:43] <mathi> well
[11:12:45] <mathi> I mean
[11:12:52] <mathi> it says in "selecting" state
[11:13:00] <Zogot> Can you make a jsfiddle
[11:13:03] <Zogot> will make it easier
[11:17:43] <mathi> Zogot, http://jsfiddle.net/FVbdw/1/
[11:18:10] <mathi> Zogot, I have heavy rendering code in change(), for the demo i replaced by a heavy for loop
[11:18:35] <ragas> how do i use a selector as a conditional?  if $('h3:contains("Foo") { ... }
[11:18:51] <mathi> Zogot, depending on the power of your comp, when clicking on an element, the dropdown doesn't display the element immediately, and execute the JS code first
[11:19:53] <mathi> ragas, try if($("h3 foo").length ?
[11:21:17] <Zogot> mathi: aye I get what you mean now.  I'm unsure of what can be done, what exactly is in the function that is taking so long?
[11:22:58] <Zogot> mathi: Depending on whats happening, you can always have it run when it loses focus
[11:22:59] <mathi> Zogot, showing/hiding TR elements, restyling TD elements, these kind of things, it jsut takes 1 second, but I don't need the dropdown to freeze, I want to terminate the dropdown event, and then execute the JS. it can be done with a timeout, but I wish to have a proper way to do it
[11:23:32] <panfist> is it possible to load new content via ajax that contains some inline js and load/initialize that js code?
[11:23:32] <Zogot> I have a project that on 1 dropdown change, it querys the DB for all atachted projects to that company from the first dropdown
[11:23:46] <Zogot> It sends the query and changes the 2nd dropdown when it loses focus, and no on change
[11:25:06] <Zogot> mathi: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/FVbdw/3/
[11:25:09] <mathi> Zogot, but it doesn't necessarily loses focus ?
[11:27:36] <mathi> Zogot, ?
[11:28:31] <Zogot> Sorry, bk, umm no
[11:28:37] <Zogot> unless you can get it to on change
[11:28:40] <Zogot> to change focus also
[11:28:49] <Zogot> Never tried that though
[11:29:47] <mathi> Zogot, you are suggesting me to use focusout, but if the user doesn't "focus out" of the dropdown ? that's what's confusing me
[11:30:00] <z1000> anyone worked with parallax?
[11:30:15] <z1000> I have it adding inline styles seems all should be working.. just not giving me any movement... anyone care to take a look?
[11:30:56] <Zogot> mathi: Nah I meant, you could always see if the .change(function( $('body').focus())) works to trigger the focusout()
[11:31:09] <Zogot> So you get the function to run after the dropdown has finished. Get what i mean?
[11:31:40] <Zogot> But I dont think its unheard of of just having it to trigger off a button or so (Apply Button)
[11:31:49] <Zogot> To the end user I doubt it means much
[11:32:03] <Zogot> Would save hassle :p
[11:33:29] <mathi> Zogot, I just tested, if I trigger focusout in change(), then the dropdown will still wait to execute the code in focusout :(
[11:33:43] <mathi> (I did  $(this).trigger('focusout');   inside change())
[11:34:08] <Zogot> did you change focus first?
[11:34:42] <mathi> no I only triggered focusout on the same element... mmm
[11:35:13] <mathi> Zogot, so you suggest me to focus out indirectly, by giving the focus to the body, right?
[11:35:32] <z1000> anyonanyone plz?
[11:35:55] <z1000> http://tinyurl.com/7kmwfe2
[11:36:14] <Zogot> mathi: I just tried it in fiddle, doesn't work.  probably wasn't the best idea anyway
[11:36:57] <mathi> Zogot, I think jQuery must allow to "terminate" an event in a callback function ... :)
[11:37:03] <mathi> there must be some function
[11:40:06] <z1000> parallax anyone?
[11:44:21] <mathi> Zogot, so you had a question0 ))
[11:44:23] <mathi> *?
[11:45:13] <bjensen> Im using a gem for my rails app that allows me to submit a file over ajax with query. SO far so good. However the response I get is not being evaluated by the browser even though the form sent was over js.
[11:45:17] <Zogot> Oh aye, this :p
[11:45:18] <Zogot>  OK, I have this, but I just realised an issue, when deleting a group, it can lead to have duplicate numbers.  What does anyone think is the best solution? http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/7f8EZ/
[11:45:19] <bjensen> Ideas?
[11:45:20] <z1000> mathi, can you help me?
[11:45:43] <mathi> Zogot, what should I do to reproduce the bug ?
[11:45:43] <Zogot> have dataType declared bjensen?
[11:45:57] <Zogot> Add 6 inputs, delete input 1 2 3, then add 3 more
[11:45:59] <bjensen> Zogot: hmm good question, let me check
[11:46:10] <Zogot> you'll end up with 2 inputs of the same numbers
[11:46:38] <mathi> Zogot, I don't get, input are added and removed fine
[11:47:01] <KWhat_Work> does insertAfter return the element it was applied to?  Ex:  item.insertAfter(e) returhs item ?
[11:47:08] <Zogot> Aye, but check the source, its productAttribute[//number][name] and productAttribute[//number][value]
[11:47:13] <Zogot> and im getting duplicate //number
[11:47:24] <Zogot> which will mess with the array passed over POST
[11:47:45] <Zogot> was it the dataType bjensen?
[11:48:03] <bjensen> Zogot: sorry I'm trying to figure out where to check it
[11:48:37] <Zogot> in your $.ajax({//code here}); the codehere should have this line
[11:48:41] <Zogot> dataType: 'json'
[11:48:45] <Zogot> or dataType: 'html' or whatever
[11:49:56] <mathi> Zogot, why don't you get the last ID in getID ?
[11:50:04] <z1000> thanks mathi
[11:50:13] <bjensen> Zogot: right but it is the ruby gem that is handling this so I need to look through its source first
[11:50:33] <mathi> z1000, no idea what is parallax
[11:50:39] <z1000> http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html
[11:50:55] <bjensen> Zogot: I can't check using firebug?
[11:51:07] <z1000> I have it pretty much working... just wont respond to mouse.. its adding inline styles... so weird
[11:52:07] <bjensen> zag
[11:52:23] <bjensen> Zogot: seams like at least one other guy has the same prob: https://github.com/JangoSteve/remotipart/issues/12
[11:52:24] <socialhapy>  Issue #12 on remotipart, reported by laleshii (1d, 7h ago): The js result after upload does not get executed
[11:54:26] <mathi> Zogot, I think you should either reset the number of all the input elements once one is removed, or somehow get the last number of the last input
[11:54:39] <Zogot> mathi: fixed it now, was something simple :) http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/7f8EZ/13/
[11:56:10] <mathi> Zogot, or that :P
[11:56:59] <mathi> Zogot, is this a javascript class ? var attributes = { ... I never code like this, where can I learn it?
[11:57:51] <NoiseEee> mathi: its an object
[11:58:19] <NoiseEee> mathi: http://eloquentjavascript.net/

[12:02:31] <FLBryce> hi everyone i have a question
[12:02:56] <FLBryce> can anyone comment on why the jquery team discontinued their template support
[12:04:09] <velts> FLBryce: i am not sure, but my guess is they didnt deem it as part of the core
[12:04:47] <velts> FLBryce: i always use john resig's micro template library http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[12:05:55] <jaja911> Hello
[12:06:03] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Simple question: are all email addresses case-insensitive?
[12:06:10] <jaja911>  does anyone know if this is really true or just a rumor.  http://www.armslist.com/?utm_source=c000015&utm_medium=plink&utm_campaign=p012705
[12:06:48] <velts> jaja911: go spam elsewhere
[12:07:03] <Cokegod> Whirl3d: no
[12:07:13] <Cokegod> oops
[12:07:27] <Cokegod> forget what I said
[12:08:08] <velts> Whirl3d: http://bit.ly/vzeYCw
[12:09:25] <enjalot> hello all
[12:10:08] <velts> hello enjalot
[12:14:53] <FLBryce> velts: thanks for the reply
[12:15:56] <FLBryce> velts: the reason for the question is we are exploring possible templates that are nice between front-end and back-end. mustache coupled with icanhaz is a good option since it has similar <script> tag usage of tempaltes on the front-end
[12:16:16] <FLBryce> but since jquery had discontinued support for jquery-templates I was worried it may have something to do with that <script> tag usage
[12:17:08] <Kzim> hi
[12:17:12] <TheEmpath> so im in an impossible to debug scenario involving keydown/up
[12:17:53] <Kzim> i don't understand why when i pass a #divname to a function to update it, it work. but if in this function i pass the same value to another function the second function can't update it
[12:17:56] <Kzim> any help plz ?
[12:18:34] <velts> Kzim: can we see some code?
[12:19:52] <Kzim> hum yes sec
[12:20:20] <TheEmpath> https://gist.github.com/1453129 basically, keydown() doesn't work at all, period
[12:21:05] <Kzim> velts: http://pastie.org/2992829, it's maybe not very clean but i try to learn. listUsed and listAvail are IDs like #sortable1 and #sortable2
[12:21:11] <singingwolfboy> IE is having trouble trying to parse a JSON object, and it looks to me like it's choking on the "default" key
[12:21:19] <Cokegod> TheEmpath: you didn't import jQuery
[12:21:22] <singingwolfboy> as in it thinks {default: "foo"} is invalid JSON
[12:21:27] <singingwolfboy> is this documented anywhere?
[12:21:41] <Kzim> velts: when getListContent was into doubledrop() it worked great. but i wanted to put it in a function to refresh the content latr
[12:21:52] <z1000> anyone ever used http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html ?
[12:22:25] <CodeZombie> is there a clean way to determine if a value in an javascript object changes? I've got an image viewer, this image viewer is built with an array of json objects. I'd like to have a variable, that is set to the currently selected images json object. If that variable changes, or a value in the json object changes, I'd like to save to the server, and update the ui
[12:22:55] <TheEmpath> Cokegod: sorry, bad example, try now
[12:23:03] <Cokegod> CodeZombie: what browsers are you targeting?
[12:23:25] <CodeZombie> Cokegod: ie9+ ff, chrome, safari
[12:23:33] <TheEmpath> if I understand this problem correctly, there's no way to "focus" on a div in HTML, so its pointless to attach keyups to specific divs, yes?
[12:23:53] <Cokegod> http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-objects-and-properties/
[12:24:11] <Cokegod> here you can find info about ECMAScript 5's way of setting getters and setters
[12:24:58] <Cokegod> ECMAScript 5 is supported in ie9 ff, chrome & safari
[12:25:16] <mathi> I try to pass "this" to a function as parameter, but it doesn't work: $('select#type').change(function() {window.setTimeout(function(){changeType(this)}, 100);
[12:25:26] <mathi> function changeType(jqueryObj) {var jqueryObj = $(jqueryObj);
[12:26:26] <Cokegod> TheEmpath: don't attach keydown events to body, attach them to document
[12:26:32] <Zogot> have a var self = this; just before the timeout line
[12:26:35] <Cokegod> like $(document).keydown(function () {});
[12:26:36] <Zogot> and then refernce self
[12:27:03] <mathi> ok i'll try
[12:27:07] <TheEmpath> Cokegod: Doesn't that create one massively gigantic list of every key binding throughout your application?
[12:27:25] <TheEmpath> Cokegod: I'd like to isolate my keybindings to specific UI components
[12:27:39] <mathi> Zogot, wow great!! works now:)) why is that so ??
[12:28:05] <TheEmpath> unless
[12:28:16] <TheEmpath> keyup() and keydown() keep an array of listeners
[12:28:31] <TheEmpath> so if I bind junk to the document, it goes through them all
[12:28:41] <Kzim> velts: found it thx !
[12:28:48] <TheEmpath> instead of overwites them like onkeydown = function() {}
[12:29:01] <Cokegod> I would make an object containing all the possible keys you want people to press
[12:29:09] <TheEmpath> gah
[12:29:11] <TheEmpath> painful
[12:29:15] <Cokegod> with functions as value
[12:29:20] <TheEmpath> i'll write a manager... thanks
[12:29:45] <frenocha> anyone else ever lose total control over their code, like not knowing anymore what does what and where?
[12:30:00] <frenocha> because I think that just happened with one of my projects ;o
[12:30:00] <aerospa> frenocha: drink coffee and rewrite
[12:30:04] <TheEmpath> frenocha: That's why we have design pattersna and documentation
[12:30:16] <TheEmpath> pattersna/patterns
[12:30:25] <frenocha> TheEmpath: indeed... but those aren't making much sense to me at the moment :P
[12:32:11] <TheEmpath> Cokegod: It appears jQuery keeps an array of event handlers automatically when adding multiple handlers to the same DOMojbect
[12:32:12] <TheEmpath> nifty
[12:32:15] <TheEmpath> making life easy
[12:32:33] <aerospa> is this the correct way to decrease the width of an element by 20px?  $('#ele').width($('#ele').width() - 20);
[12:33:00] <VidMas> hey all
[12:33:01] <big_swimmer> aerospa: yes
[12:33:05] <z1000> so sad
[12:33:10] <z1000> I know someone has worked with parallax
[12:33:22] <aerospa> vidmas: hey big_swimmer: thanks
[12:34:41] <VidMas> Question, I have a table that is being generated via PHP, I want to be able to add and remove rows via jQuery. On a static table this is no problem, but I am not sure how to bind a dynamically created table to an action. the "live" function will not work here because I am binding the adding of a row on a form submission not a clickable element
[12:35:50] <Zogot> What is the element thats adding the row?
[12:36:41] <Cokegod> VidMas: $('#mySubmitButton').submit(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); doStuffToAddRow(); });
[12:38:01] <VidMas> Cokegod: this is not working either it seems. The problem is not a page refresh. I am calling the submit of the form via $.ajax, on success this is when the table row is added, but it seems to have no effect.. :(
[12:38:21] <Cokegod> can you show more code?
[12:40:39] <NoiseEee> VidMas: put a single event listener on the table, monitor for clicks you care about. dynamically added rows will be firing the event too.
[12:41:28] <Cokegod> oh then I understand your problem now, I would suggest doing it with the build in selector in .on()
[12:49:40] <VidMas> NoiseEee: I can do this even if the table is generated after the initial load of the HTML page?
[12:50:40] <NoiseEee> VidMas: yes.  read about "event delegation"
[12:50:53] <VidMas> NoiseEee: Perfect thanks!
[12:51:04] <NoiseEee> VidMas: if you're saying the table itself isnt rendered yet, then i'd put the listener on the table-to-be's parent
[12:51:18] <VidMas> NoiseEee: Yes that's what I will have to do
[12:51:25] <NoiseEee> VidMas: then you inquire about the event.target to see if its what you/your script cares about
[12:51:53] <VidMas> NoiseEee: OK that sounds like the way to go. Thanks again
[12:52:09] <NoiseEee> VidMas: np
[12:55:43] <sudoihdev> anybody here have experience with iscroll4? I'm having a strange bug I could use some help with
[13:07:34] <riyonuk> I cannot figure out why this refuses to work. Can someone help me? :( - http://d.pr/oG4o
[13:08:05] <NoiseEee> riyonuk: just a hunch, but you probably want to drop any measurement units before doing mathematical operations
[13:08:20] <NoiseEee> otherwise, "refuses to work" means what?
[13:08:31] <riyonuk> So its calculating with the px?
[13:08:45] <NoiseEee> riyonuk: if outerHeight() is giving you "180px" of course it is
[13:08:58] <riyonuk> how do I get the raw number?
[13:09:11] <NoiseEee> that is your challenge.
[13:09:16] <riyonuk> god dammit :p
[13:09:19] <riyonuk> thanks though

[13:17:39] <jedimind> Cokegod, i guess im looking for a callback that would execute after the very last item in the .each
[13:18:02] <sudoihdev> durin: http://www.efectorelativo.net/laboratory/noobSlide/ and look through these as well: http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/57-free-image-gallery-slideshow-and-lightbox-solutions/
[13:18:28] <Cokegod> jedimind: maybe add if(i==array.length) doSomethingAtTheEnd();
[13:18:44] <durin> i've been trying to google for a while and haven't had much luck, i'll check those out
[13:18:53] <jedimind> yeah, i was hoping there was a built in callback so i wouldnt have to do hat
[13:18:55] <jedimind> that*
[13:19:05] <riyonuk> Cokegod: even setting b = 30px; doesn't even work..
[13:19:22] <Kzim> i have 2 sortable connected list. is it possibl eto have a confirmation popup before i drop the item on the other box ?
[13:20:11] <Cokegod> can you give the html related to this?
[13:20:33] <Cokegod> btw, which code editor are you using? it looks pretty nice
[13:20:37] <riyonuk> No, sorry :/
[13:20:40] <riyonuk> just textmate
[13:21:22] <riyonuk> oh wait
[13:21:31] <Cokegod> try adding "px" to b
[13:21:33] <riyonuk> I have to do the jquery on load thing, right?
[13:21:41] <Cokegod> yea...
[13:22:40] <durin> this is basically what i'm trying to do (semi NSFW: bikinis) - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453964/slider.jpg
[13:23:09] <riyonuk> it works!
[13:23:21] <riyonuk> I'm retarded though :3 - thanks man, for the b string thing
[13:24:52] <TonkaTruck> Hey yall.  Can I use Deferred.pipe in a for loop?  I have an array of objects that implement a function post().  Each post() returns a deferred.  I want to run through each post(), in serial, and resolve a single deferred.  My head hurts.
[13:28:09] <Cokegod> riyonuk: what font are you using in textmate?
[13:28:55] <riyonuk> Cokegod: http://d.pr/i776
[13:29:14] <chovy> what happens with array_merge($a, $b) when a & b have two identical keys with different values? Is there a gauranteed priority? Ie: $a['foo'] will become the the value used in the merged array?
[13:29:47] <Cokegod> thanks
[13:31:39] <NoiseEee> chovy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[13:33:23] <chovy> NoiseEee: sorry, i meant this for #php
[13:36:49] <luckysmack> i have a callback on document ready such as $('select').change(function(){somecodehere;}); I have this for various select lists and want it to fire when the user changes the value. But with this method, how can I figure out which select list was the one that actually was selected and changed?
[13:37:29] <logix812> is there a way to get another ready() style event when I use $.ajax to load html drop it into the dom? I just want to know what that new html is ready, aka, images loaded etc. Maybe you can't do that, but I figured I would ask
[13:38:16] <luckysmack> is there a way I can use 'this' ?
[13:38:55] <NoiseEee> luckysmack: try it and see.  console.log(this)
[13:43:11] <Eviltwin> luckysmack: "this" will refer to the DOM element of the <select> that was changed
[13:43:24] <Eviltwin> luckysmack: If you want to do jQuery stuff to it do $(this)...
[13:43:36] <luckysmack> i know I can use (and I do in many places) use this to get the actual element. But ive only ever seen that used when it was on the html as an attribute such as <div onchange=(doSomething(this))> or when using objects. but not when the callback to detect the changed select lists is in the document ready area.
[13:44:47] <permryiad> in jqGrid, is there a way to access the grid options from within a custom formatter function?
[13:45:39] <Eviltwin> luckysmack: That's because you can't do onchange="...this..."
[13:46:53] <Eviltwin> Well actually it depends
[13:47:07] <cornfeed> if i have incrimental form elements that i need renumbered what would be the best way to do it if they are in the scheme:  name="_rules[$id][part]"
[13:47:22] <luckysmack> thats what I was wondering about, I thought once before I saw a way to do it but couldnt find anything. So then to do something for these select lists, I will need to do it for every select list individually
[13:47:34] <NoiseEee> no
[13:47:53] <luckysmack> if I use it inline the html code I can use this, just not globally, it seems.
[13:48:12] <Eviltwin> luckysmack: What?
[13:48:22] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle of what you're trying to do?
[13:52:47] <luckysmack> Eviltwin: heh sorry my last comment wasnt clear. distracted at work. yea ill throw something up.
[13:58:32] <zeroLiver> Anyone know why addClass does not work?
[13:59:10] <zeroLiver> sorry let me finish that message, one second...
[14:00:09] * jedimind waits
[14:00:56] <luckysmack> Eviltwin: i figured out how to do what I need. THought I tried it before but for whatever reason I was using the wrong keyword on the calling function. ill post what im doing
[14:03:09] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, do you use any sort of captcha/equivolent to stop spam in contact forms?

[14:12:05] <luckysmack> yea
[14:12:29] <NoiseEee> so, everything is cool?
[14:12:46] <luckysmack> oh, yea. It was more of an oversight on my part.
[14:12:58] <NoiseEee> ok
[14:13:06] <luckysmack> I was using 'element' where I was supposed to be using 'this'
[14:13:11] <luckysmack> idk why
[14:17:10] <Whirl3d> good evening all. Could someone point me to a good tutorial on encoding html form data with jquery for php?
[14:25:19] <big_swimmer> does the .html function close open tags?
[14:25:26] <chovy> Whirl3d: $("#form_id").serialize() ?
[14:25:37] <chovy> big_swimmer: i don't think so.
[14:26:11] <chovy> might depend on the browser on how it's actually rendered.
[14:27:09] <fabiobik> hi guys
[14:27:15] <big_swimmer> ah, just read the documentation and it does end open tags
[14:27:22] <big_swimmer> Description: Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements.
[14:27:37] <fabiobik> i dont know why, my div dont bounce, but the linear animation works
[14:27:42] <maloi> hello, how can make the tabs from jquery tabs unclickable but still be able to select by a textlink?
[14:27:57] <big_swimmer> fabiobik: do you have the ease functions?
[14:28:12] <big_swimmer> jquery ui or similar
[14:29:02] <fabiobik> big_swimmer yeh thats my problem
[14:29:04] <fabiobik> thanks mate
[14:29:09] <fabiobik> solved xD
[14:29:16] <big_swimmer> fabiobik: :D happens to the best of us
[14:29:47] <knapper_tech> Anyone know where to find a jquery wireframe kit for UI designers
[14:32:38] <big_swimmer> what is that
[14:38:14] <chovy> i don't know.
[14:38:29] <chovy> probably wants some standard features already programmed.
[14:42:59] <Kilian-> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/asynchronous-blocks-of-synchronous-actions < would be happy if someone could take a look or two
[14:44:39] <ajpiano> Kilian-: you should use deferreds
[14:44:41] <ajpiano> probably.
[14:44:45] <Ahrengot> Can anyone help me pass the event object along to my handler in jQuery.bind()? I want to do a e.preventDefault but can't seem to pass the event object correctly. Take a look at my fiddle to see where I'm at: http://jsfiddle.net/Ahrengot/tNFN4/

[14:45:24] <Kilian-> gonna take a look, thanks
[14:45:46] <ajpiano> Ahrengot: bind('clic') ?
[14:46:00] <ajpiano> Ahrengot: you don't have to "pass" the event object in
[14:46:17] <gnarf> $.when($("#div_item1").delay(1000).show(0), $("#div_item2,#div_item3").show(0)).done( function() { $("div1").hide(); });
[14:46:44] <Ahrengot> ajpiano yeah saw the typo in click. It's fixed now. Still can't seem to get it to work.
[14:46:57] <Ahrengot> What do you mean I don't have to pass the event object?
[14:46:58] <ajpiano> Ahrengot: why are you trying to pass the evnet handler in as data
[14:47:09] <ajpiano> i mean that the event object is provided for you
[14:47:28] <ajpiano> the {e: e} doesn't really make sense
[14:47:37] <ericandrewlewis> does anybody know of any good data visualization libraries?
[14:47:43] <Kilian-> gnarf: when() works parallel?
[14:47:52] <Ahrengot> all I think i got it now
[14:47:55] <ericandrewlewis> not sure where to ask this, figure jquery people might know some good looking ones :)
[14:48:09] <Ahrengot> $('#button').bind('click', event, handleClick); seems to work
[14:48:44] <Kilian-> and how should i connect a couple of whens together? easy as $.when(..).when(..)?
[14:49:22] <danheberden> Kilian- why would you connect them?
[14:49:31] <danheberden> like $.when( thingA, thingB, thingC ) ?
[14:49:54] <Kilian-> because i need sequential processing of parallel blocks
[14:50:07] <danheberden> and when they're all done?
[14:50:27] <Kilian-> then I'm happy
[14:50:30] <Kilian-> :)
[14:50:45] <danheberden> sequential would be like $.when( something ).done( function() { $.when( anotherThing ); } );
[14:50:53] <Kilian-> jep
[14:51:02] <danheberden> but you'd have better luck writing that logic yourself in that case
[14:51:10] <Kilian-> that was my questio nabout, whether I could just use $.when( something).when is sequential
[14:51:32] <Kilian-> or i need to chain it with .done
[14:51:35] <danheberden> the promise returned doesn't have when
[14:51:46] <danheberden> $.when().when == undefined
[14:51:50] <danheberden> you can pipe
[14:51:59] <danheberden> ?pipe
[14:52:00] <bot-t> deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[14:52:15] <gnarf> it makes more sense to write each as its own function
[14:52:20] <danheberden> gnarf++
[14:52:50] <gnarf> and then use either a queue/or deferreds for the stacking order
[14:53:00] <gnarf> rather than writing more functions inside of callbacks of other functions
[14:53:15] <Kilian-> yes, that is what I am trying to avoid
[14:53:26] <gnarf> just used named functions for each step
[14:53:43] <gnarf> then you can do something like $({}).queue(fn1).queue(fn2).queue(fn3)
[14:53:59] <gnarf> and each function fn1( next ) { // do some shit then call next() }
[14:54:08] <Kilian-> thought about that
[14:54:12] <Kilian-> but hoped for a better way
[14:54:19] <Kilian-> because that will be a lot of functions ;)
[14:54:57] <danzik17> a lot of small, easy to understand functions is better than one big convulted one imo
[14:55:04] <danzik17> convoluted**
[14:55:18] <Kilian-> depends. have to care about traffic at some point.
[14:55:28] <danheberden> Kilian- wat
[14:55:57] <Kilian-> wat-wat
[14:56:14] <danheberden> put your pantries contents in a big tub or organized nicely on shelves - either way, you have X amount of groceries
[14:56:31] <danheberden> also, that's what things like uglify.js is for
[14:57:27] <Kilian-> well, I just try to avoid unnecessary function-calls which blow up the code
[14:57:33] <Kilian-> but uglify .. right
[14:58:14] <ajpiano> Kilian-: if you're concerned about performance
[14:58:25] <Kilian-> thanks anyways, gonna play around with the suggestions above
[14:58:32] <ajpiano> learn to cache your selectors, before you start worrying about cutting down on function calls
[14:58:53] <ajpiano> first write organised code and then worry about optimisation
[14:59:05] <Kilian-> ajpiano: that was not actual code..
[14:59:14] <ajpiano> oh, phew
[14:59:28] <jedimind> dun dun dunnn
[14:59:31] <jedimind> fake code, strikes again!
[14:59:36] <Kilian-> example code
[15:00:29] <Kilian-> but regarding optimasation: any pro-tips regarding timing-issues for jquery?
[15:00:38] <Kilian-> I would need my functions mainly be very time-accurate
[15:01:12] <ajpiano> Kilian-: you are writing way too much code for this situation
[15:01:42] <ajpiano> Kilian-: one of the approaches here might solve your problem of a sequential set of arbitrary blocks
[15:01:54] <ajpiano> ?g paulirish sequentially jquery
[15:01:55] <bot-t> ajpiano, Sequentially chain your callbacks in jQuery  Three ways  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[15:03:16] <ajpiano> store the actual time delay inside of a data attribute on each block, get the elements, and then just do one after the other
[15:03:42] <ajpiano> but i'm not 100 sure of what you're trying to do, so i don't want to get too deep into the world of conjecture
[15:04:00] <ajpiano> Kilian-: as far as timer accuracy, see ?g accuracy of javascript time resig
[15:04:01] <bot-t> Kilian-, John Resig - Accuracy of JavaScript Time - http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/
[15:04:08] <Kilian-> alright, will take a look
[15:05:31] <ajpiano> the bottom line is, the delay on a timeout is like, *the minimum* amount of time it will take - if for whatever reason it's dreadfully important for that thing to take 2123ms instead of 2124ms, you're probably out of luck

[15:34:28] <razzi> noregret, an effect in what?

[15:39:24] <razzi> nogret, do labelify() after you change the title ?
[15:40:44] <cornfeed> i would post into a pastebin, but i figure i am missing something simple here
[15:41:39] <razzi> cornfeed, you probbaly want rname == 'rules'
[15:42:15] <cornfeed> i had that before, figured i was taking a bit of php with me :-P, either way that doesnt do it

[16:00:34] <datlap> i m calculating a val called duration based on user's select of start and end field (using onSelect) this works well if there is no form validation error, in which case the form gets reloaded w/ start and end already filled in w/ the past values and  duration is null. what to do?
[16:09:47] <KWhat_Work> is there a jquery ui bug tracker somewhere

[16:27:46] <datlap> i have a form w/ value called Total that gets computed automatically whenever user picks a date using onSelect.

[16:30:02] <zulax> Eviltwin, oh, you should click on blue
[16:30:16] <zulax> and then instead of just red moving, both move, (clcik blue again to stope)
[16:30:17] <Eviltwin> zulax: Here, take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/4/
[16:30:44] <zulax> Eviltwin,  my bad, http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/5/
[16:32:02] <datlap> Eviltwin: i m  using jquery's datepicker onselect on a field called arrival to compute a hidden div val called total. If there is an error on some other field (ex address field) then onSelect never gets called since it retains the previous arrival value. Does that make sense?
[16:32:11] <Eviltwin> zulax: You're adjusting the size of an element
[16:32:16] <Eviltwin> And the other one is relatively positioned to it
[16:32:43] <cornfeed> why the hell did i even question jquery, of course if was !@#!@#$!@$ firebug!!!
[16:32:53] <zulax> ok, should they be absolute? i will try
[16:34:00] <Eviltwin> zulax: Is there a reason you're not doing this?
[16:34:18] <zulax> Eviltwin, I want to move a car across the screen and stop it on button click

[16:36:01] <zulax> Eviltwin, thanks, is there a better way of doing this?
[16:36:26] <Eviltwin> Doing what?
[16:36:55] <Eviltwin> Your animation?
[16:36:58] <zulax> for running a car across the screen?
[16:37:15] <Eviltwin> First of all, you're making a little 50x50 pixel loop
[16:37:28] <Eviltwin> That doesn't screan "running a car across the screen" to me
[16:37:39] <Eviltwin> Is this the animation you're looking for?
[16:37:42] <zulax> well, i would certainly increase it in production
[16:38:13] <Eviltwin> But this is the animation you're looking for?
[16:38:41] <zulax> to be honest, yes but this is all i know as well as fat as animating this stuff
[16:39:00] <Eviltwin> Well there's a significantly better way of doing this animation at least
[16:39:53] <zulax> like some kind of package? or another function
[16:40:14] <AfroTurf> is there a jquery method for taking an a string and making it an object? trying to stay away from eval()
[16:40:29] <Eviltwin> zulax: It's called an animation queue
[16:40:29] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/7/
[16:40:36] <Eviltwin> They're built in to jQuery
[16:40:56] <zulax> thats looks very elegant! thanks Eviltwin
[16:40:56] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: Is it a JSON string?
[16:41:05] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: correct
[16:41:07] <cdkdang> hi i have a qustion regarding jquery ui autocomplete vs devden jquery autocomplete
[16:41:25] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: First see ?jsisjs
[16:41:26] <bot-t> AfroTurf, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[16:41:35] <Eviltwin> And you're looking for JSON.parse
[16:41:43] <AfroTurf> ah thanks
[16:42:32] <cdkdang> i have devden jquery autocomplete working with remote php that gives json results but can't get jquery ui autocomplete to use same remote php
[16:43:02] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: In case the browser doesn't natively support it, you probably want to include json2.js: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[16:43:39] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: interesting.. thanks again!
[16:50:48] <cdkdang> can someone tell me if my php is outputting the right json for jquery ui's autocomplete widget pleas?

[16:53:53] <CodeZombie> having trouble with this ajax request after setting contentType to application/json https://gist.github.com/7a10e236e19381001794, seems that my rails server is spitting out this error: "MultiJson::DecodeError (751: unexpected token at 'type_list%5B%5D=A2-3-1.pdf')" , if I remove the content type, it works but null values aren't sent with the request.
[16:54:15] <CodeZombie> any tips would be appreciated
[16:54:42] <dkdang> Eviltwin: are you referring to me?
[16:55:19] <Eviltwin> dkdang: Use Firebug or something to look at the JSON here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-source
[16:55:43] <dkdang> i don't see any leading \ufeff
[16:56:13] <Eviltwin> dkdang: use curl or wget and less or more or something
[16:56:14] <dkdang> eviltwin: i did a google search for \ufeff and refers to utf8. the output must be utf8 because i need chinese characters
[16:56:34] <rickup> Hey everyone.  jquery display a message while DOM is loading... and just have it disappear once the page has loaded.  I do have to stay stuck on jQuery 1.3.2 unfortunately... And I don't know why but this simple demo http://api.jquery.com/ready/  prints the "ready text" twice...   I would use jsfiddle but this page is quite complex so the url is http://cloudflare.easywaas.com/locations/century-city-virtual-office
[16:56:48] <zulax> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/8/    now trying to stop, doesnt stop immediately
[16:57:09] <Eviltwin> zulax: see ?stop
[16:57:10] <bot-t> zulax, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[16:57:13] <rickup> which if it work the it should, would be the opposite of what I want anyway ( I believe)
[16:58:31] <Eviltwin> rickup: see ?jdb
[16:58:31] <bot-t> rickup, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[17:02:18] <rickup> so this http://jsfiddle.net/yyHE7/ prints twice on my page which I thought was strange... Does anyone know what would cause that?
[17:03:23] <abjorn> Oh boy, I can now enroll in the HostGator 401k....!
[17:03:52] <abjorn> coldhod
[17:03:54] <abjorn> coldhead
[17:03:56] <abjorn> coldhad
[17:03:58] <abjorn> caldhad
[17:04:29] <Eviltwin> rickup: If you can't reproduce it in a JS fiddle, it's because you're doing something horribly wrong on your site
[17:04:50] <rickup> Can anyone recommend a "throbber" or "Page is loading please be patient" message plugin or snippet I can use while waiting for  $(document).ready to do its thing?  Thanks.
[17:05:19] <Eviltwin> Um...
[17:05:37] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the difference between $(document).ready and $(window).load?
[17:06:03] <coldhead> you pulled it off, abjorn ?
[17:06:11] <abjorn> pulled what off
[17:06:11] <coldhead> you're a Developer?
[17:06:14] <rickup> Eviltwin, I probably do not but I will read the differences now.  Thank you.
[17:06:15] <abjorn> dunno yet
[17:06:20] <coldhead> oh
[17:06:21] <abjorn> but i got a letter about 401k
[17:06:22] <abjorn> today
[17:06:24] <abjorn> so was like
[17:06:26] <abjorn> "olololo"
[17:06:27] <coldhead> well join that society if they have you
[17:06:36] <coldhead> the computer guy society
[17:06:37] <abjorn> uhm sure
[17:06:40] <coldhead> thanks
[17:06:47] <coldhead> i would if i were a developer
[17:06:55] <abjorn> ur not a developr?
[17:07:16] <coldhead> no, i just sit by the senior engineer and hit enter for him when he asks
[17:07:18] <coldhead> or sometimes tab
[17:07:22] <coldhead> i just do whitespace
[17:08:26] <abjorn> never spacebar?
[17:08:40] <coldhead> no, that's too advanced
[17:08:55] <abjorn> ya you gotta bust your chops in enter for a year before you get to spacebar
[17:09:10] <coldhead> apparently i don't appreciate the "nuance" of space uet
[17:09:13] <coldhead> yet*
[17:09:24] <abjorn> well i mean
[17:09:25] <abjorn> look at it
[17:09:31] <abjorn> its such a large, imposing part of the keyboard
[17:09:46] <Eviltwin> I don't let people on my team use objects until they've implemented functioning Java in MIPS
[17:10:19] <abjorn> I don't let people on my team do anything until I've written all the code, then I let them get me a drink
[17:10:34] <Eviltwin> Ooo, good policy
[17:10:40] <coldhead> i'm not allowed to get drinkks yet
[17:10:41] <rickup> so I am trying to use .ready like for lack of a better term a like a "while loop?"  when maybe I should be using $(window).load() perhaps?
[17:10:46] <zulax> can i do assignment statement while animating? http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/11/
[17:10:52] <coldhead> i'm still on the checking if the bathroom is free level
[17:10:55] <Eviltwin> rickup: Wait, what?
[17:10:58] <rickup> heh
[17:11:02] <Eviltwin> A "while loop"?
[17:11:13] <Eviltwin> What in God's name?
[17:11:19] <Eviltwin> How are those even related?
[17:11:34] <rickup> speaking in general terms here  I write php not jquery
[17:11:35] <coldhead> http://dontclickthis.whatingods.name/
[17:12:16] <abjorn> I didn't know .name was a valid tld
[17:12:32] <Eviltwin> So's .xxx now
[17:12:33] <snover> dont click that.
[17:12:37] <coldhead> http://dontclickthis.whatingods.name/gibson-siren.gif
[17:12:54] <abjorn> yeah but you cant yet register .xxx
[17:13:03] <abjorn> it was approved but theres no top level dns servers for it yet
[17:13:23] <Eviltwin> http://zzz.yyy.xxx/
[17:13:32] <abjorn> oh snap
[17:13:34] <abjorn> since when
[17:13:38] <abjorn> THIS SHIT MOVES TO OFAST
[17:13:39] <rickup> Yeah this $(window).load() is not really what I am looking for either...
[17:13:45] <Eviltwin> I dunno, someone linked it to me a week ago or something
[17:13:50] <zulax> will animate() allow me to store js variables while animating?
[17:13:51] <zulax> http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/11/
[17:13:57] <Eviltwin> rickup: I still have no idea what you are loking for
[17:14:09] <Eviltwin> zulax: Uh...no
[17:14:36] <Eviltwin> You'll have to go back to the other scheme
[17:14:39] <zulax> Eviltwin, i guess i could use some css property as a hack to store variables then?
[17:14:39] <Eviltwin> Or a similar one
[17:14:45] <Eviltwin> I highly suggest against it
[17:14:49] <rickup> when I submitted earlier the most relevant portion of my post was missing and all the rest of the info was pre-emptive to the replies I usually get
[17:14:57] <rickup> I will think about it and start over
[17:15:17] <coldhead> ?data @ zulax
[17:15:17] <bot-t> zulax, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:15:56] <zulax> coldhead, could i do it while in animation?
[17:16:05] <zulax> my variables depend on where animation is being done
[17:16:56] <coldhead> you should be able to do it wherever you need, zulax
[17:17:23] <zulax> coldhead, even here?http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/11/
[17:17:26] <espressive> Hey all
[17:17:29] <coldhead> if you're doing something intricate and animatey you should read all the docs you can find
[17:17:43] <espressive> Where is the discussion happening regarding the jQuery plugins site development?
[17:18:05] <coldhead> zulax: google for jquery custom animations and jquery animate callbacks
[17:18:33] <coldhead> you will probably need to define your own tick handler if it's sensitive to the animation's progress
[17:18:39] <coldhead> it's not something i've done much of
[17:19:01] <rickup> What I want is for this a webpage to display a message in the center of the screen until the entire page, including all elements within the page are loaded also.
[17:19:38] <rickup> So I am attempting to use this demo4 http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#demos  "While the page is loading".  That is the part I need help with.
[17:20:13] <AfroTurf> zulax: you can save your variable in the step object of .animate()
[17:20:46] <zulax> AfroTurf, cool
[17:21:02] <rickup> so are  $(document).ready or  $(window).load where I should be looking?
[17:21:06] <AfroTurf> zulax: look in the docs.. i think it shows you how
[17:21:22] <Eviltwin> zulax: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/12/
[17:22:45] <zulax> Eviltwin, wow, that looks kinda complex to me, i will see if i can make use of step function, else i will come back to your code, thanks alot
[17:22:56] <zulax> is loop an obj?
[17:23:40] <Eviltwin> Array
[17:23:51] <Eviltwin> It's functioning a queue
[17:24:10] <Eviltwin> I remove the first function from the list, save it as "action" and add it to the end of the list
[17:32:17] <AfroTurf> how do i get only part of the dom selected usin $.ajax() like $("#container").get("myfile.html .foo");
[17:33:31] <rickup> It seems like more examples are geared to hiding things until after the page has loaded rather than displaying a message / throbber image while waiting for the page to load :(
[17:33:58] <zulax> AfroTurf, thanks, i got it working, Eviltwin this certainly is not as elegant but gets the work done for me, thanks for your help too. http://jsfiddle.net/5tmC2/13/
[17:34:47] <zulax> except it doesnt loop now :(
[17:37:05] <AfroTurf> zulax: complete: function() {}
[17:38:28] <zulax> now its getting hard to see which curly brace goes where
[17:39:26] <AfroTurf> i would use eviltwins function queue though
[17:39:35] <Eviltwin> As would I
[17:40:52] <zulax> ok, time to learn then, thanks
[17:40:58] <AfroTurf> animate().animate().animate()  this doesn't seem like a good idea
[17:41:38] <zulax> yea, i sure cant debug that after a while
[17:41:49] <Eviltwin> I don't think there's anything wrong with .animate().animate().animate() but using the step function to set a variable is kinda screwy
[17:42:03] <AfroTurf> ya
[17:43:04] <zulax> so the first time it runs, var action = loop.shift()?
[17:43:21] <zulax> some thing with stack
[17:43:37] <Eviltwin> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4]; a.shift()
[17:43:38] <zulax> does action now get the loop[0]
[17:43:39] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 1
[17:43:40] <Eviltwin> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4]; a.shift();a
[17:43:41] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [2, 3, 4]
[17:44:09] <Eviltwin> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4]; var x=a.shift();a.push(x):a
[17:44:10] <bot-t> Eviltwin: SyntaxError: invalid label
[17:44:13] <Eviltwin> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4]; var x=a.shift();a.push(x);a
[17:44:14] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [2, 3, 4, 1]
[17:46:32] <zulax> action(animate), does that call function(cb) inside loop?
[17:47:35] <Eviltwin> I'm passing in animate as the cb argument for the function
[17:47:48] <zulax> makes sense,
[17:47:59] <zulax> is there a terminology for what you are doing?
[17:48:02] <zulax> lambda expressions/
[17:48:03] <zulax> ?
[17:48:08] <Eviltwin> Then that gets fired when the animation is done
[17:48:27] <Eviltwin> Well these are called anonymous functions
[17:48:45] <Eviltwin> A side effect of the closure properties of JavaScript
[17:49:20] <zulax> so while doing var action = loop.shift(), now action is a fucntion!
[17:49:20] <zulax> cool
[17:49:27] <Eviltwin> Yup
[17:49:38] <zulax> but why pass animate?
[17:50:03] <Eviltwin> So that shift-push-execute happens again
[17:50:58] <zulax> AH! so the cb after 2000 becomes that animate function!
[17:51:04] <Eviltwin> Yup
[17:51:18] <zulax> man , this must take a while to get used to!
[17:51:32] <AfroTurf> :)
[18:25:08] <lyrae> When you click on an element, is there a way to know it's index in the object? for example, if i click on a <p> inside a div with many <p>'s, is there a way to know if it was the first <p> or second or third, etc
[18:28:13] <durin> hi, does anyone know of a shadowbox/lightbox style plugin that will do a full screen width slideshow with multiple images next to each other when you bring up the box?
[18:28:51] <razzi> lyrae, something like $(this).parent().index(this) ?
[18:29:06] <lyrae> will try. thanks razzi
[18:29:12] <razzi> maybe there's a better way idn
[18:29:22] <Eviltwin> lyrae: $(this).index()
[18:29:35] <lyrae> Eviltwin: thank you
[18:29:45] <Eviltwin> I think that's sufficient
[18:29:54] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[18:30:03] <razzi> oh yeah, true

[18:43:17] <chovy> has anyone noticed jquery click handlers not working in IE7/8 when using .live or .delegate and the links are loaded via ajax and appended to the DOM?

[19:49:15] <operator1> DP_: I've got a page to provide a service, all is embedded to make it easier to test. The first div appears if connection test is good. Click the first button, it tests if available, if true, goes to registration and that's where I get messed up at.
[19:50:00] <DP_> operator1: link?
[19:50:08] <DP_> or code?
[19:50:38] <operator1> DP_:at registration, I attempt to pass to the require variables to server, but it doesn't do it. It reload the page.
[19:50:46] <operator1> DP_:http://jsfiddle.net/1designs/VJ4Dp/

[19:51:41] <creativeround> lynae....not interested?
[19:51:49] <lyrae> creativeround: does it have to be via jquery?
[19:51:51] <jlester4> Does anyone know why my code would be working on jsfiddle but not on my computer?  I've copied everything I have in the boxes to my computer.
[19:51:59] <lyrae> you can do it in php with strip_tags($string)
[19:52:13] <lyrae> use ajax if needed
[19:52:14] <creativeround> well....mailchimp uses ajax....and send me back the data variable....
[19:52:24] <DP_> checking it out...
[19:52:34] <operator1> DP_:Thank you
[19:52:44] <lyrae> eh?
[19:52:48] <creativeround> so...i just need to know that if it sends back <span class="mc_error_msg">&raquo; That email address is invalid.<br /></span>
[19:53:08] <creativeround> I can strip out the html tags....and just get the error message.
[19:53:21] <creativeround> http://jsfiddle.net/Q2bQL/
[19:53:26] <creativeround> theres the code
[19:53:47] <lyrae> then you take that, make an ajax call to a php file that does strip_tags() and send it back to javascript
[19:53:59] <creativeround> I already does a regex if its successfull.....    var reg = new RegExp("class='mc_success_msg'", 'i');
[19:54:34] <lyrae> right, but then you have to apply regex to the inside, since there's a<br /> in there. it's a lot easier with php
[19:54:54] <lyrae> operator1: hello
[19:55:59] <lyrae> creativeround: if you cant do that, then try asking here http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/index.php?board=6.0
[19:56:02] <creativeround> actually....i don';t even care about stripping out the tags....  I just want it to say "Invalid email, please try again"
[19:56:41] <creativeround> I was going to do this...but its not working:     var regerror = new RegExp('class="mc_error_msg"', 'i');
[19:58:11] <operator1> lyrae: hello
[19:59:20] <operator1> lyrae: hello hi
[19:59:22] <lyrae> So you get this from mail chimp "<span class="mc_error_msg">&raquo; That email address is invalid.<br /></span>" and you want to check that if you get that, just display 'invalid email' ?
[19:59:30] <DP_> I'm trying to test, but it's saying "Sorry, but we're experience some technical difficulties.
[19:59:30] <DP_> Please try again later."
[19:59:41] <DP_> That's not where the issue is, is it?
[19:59:56] <operator1> DP_: no
[20:00:13] <lyrae> creativeround: PM me
[20:00:17] <operator1> DP_: Hold on
[20:00:53] <creativeround> I'm on a web based IRC client....don't think I can....one second.
[20:03:24] <operator1> OH NO.........
[20:04:10] <abjorn> OH GOD
[20:04:14] <abjorn> HOLD ON TO YER BUTTS
[20:04:19] <operator1> Now who will help me...? I've posted it here: http://operator1designs.webs.com/test3.html

[21:46:57] <mushroomed> I wanna use a selector that filters a click just from an:  "a" element that is inside a "div" that is inside of a "ul" who's id is "pagination-digg"
[21:47:28] <mushroomed> I'm trying this but it doesn't work: $('ul[id="pagination-digg"] > div a').click(function() {
[21:48:15] <igore> There is a good plugin developed that is now being used for wordpress upload
[21:48:40] <igore> shit, I started answering a question from many hours ago.. sorry
[21:50:56] <igore> why not jquery('div a').find('ul[]');
[21:51:13] <igore> mushroomed: that was for you
[21:53:15] <mushroomed> igore: but then the click function?
[21:53:40] <igore> jquery('div a').find('ul[]').click();
[21:53:41] <mushroomed> ('div a').find('ul[]').click(func ?
[21:53:43] <mushroomed> mmkay thanks!

[23:03:07] <rickup> Hello.  I hid some divs on page load with #edit-attributes-45-wrapper { display:none;}  I can't figure out how to display them (until the next page load?) with a hover on the first select  I can use the specific selector if thats easier it will never change.  Any ideas?
[23:05:17] <rickup> there is no jquery involved but I am thinking there might need to be.  The thing is the one [select] is just the beginning in a long form of chained attributes and options which I have a specific drupal module to handle to maybe jquery is not righ for this.  Any thoughts or hints?
[23:14:49] <Hierofant> dunno what that means
[23:14:59] <Hierofant> whats a [select]
[23:32:50] <rickup> the select in a form
[23:32:56] <rickup> contains options
