[00:20:21] <w1z> anyone know a good tutorial where to find how to use progress bars ?
[00:25:04] <m_e> can you somehow subselect an element like this: $(element[0]).subselectelement("#myid").dosomething()
[00:25:50] <m_e> element[0] is an javascript object. $(element[0]) works fine. i only want to select a subelement of that with the specific id
[00:26:15] <psykrsna> m_e, What do you mean by subselect?
[00:26:31] <psykrsna> Do you mean you want to access the child of a DOM element?
[00:29:24] <m_e> i believe so.
[00:29:52] <m_e> i am using a datepicker like this: http://pastebin.com/bLWuSweY
[00:30:36] <m_e> now i want to select a child DOM element of element[0] in that selection
[00:31:27] <m_e> i.e. element[0] may be: <div> whatever <div id="someChild"></div></div>. now how would i select that someChild?
[00:35:51] <m_e> ok looks like that element is an jqLite object representing the DOM node: "element is the jqLite-wrapped element that this directive matches."
[00:35:54] <Cork> ?api find @ m_e
[00:35:54] <b-ot> m_e: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[00:36:15] <Kamuela> w1z: in what way? are you actually monitoring a file upload or something?
[00:36:29] <Cork> m_e: also your example doesn't really make sense, as ids are page unique
[00:36:45] <Cork> m_e: so they can't only ever exist in one place in a valid page
[00:37:07] <Cork> (class="someChild" would be a different matter though)
[00:38:15] <m_e> Cork: yep, but i assumed that it is faster to just select a DOM element of a small part instead of searching through the whole DOM
[00:38:29] <Cork> m_e: not for ids
[00:38:56] <Cork> each id on the page (the first occurrence of the id) exist in a hash table in the browser
[00:39:09] <Cork> so requesting for an id (and nothing but just the id) is really really fast
[00:39:22] <Cork> cause the browser doesn't have to look in the dom for it
[00:39:26] <m_e> Cork: ah, thats good to know. thank you
[00:39:42] <Kamuela> w1z: if so, this may help https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[00:39:44] <Cork> classes is also kept in a different form of hash table
[00:39:52] <Cork> so it is normally almost as quick
[00:39:55] <m_e> Cork: anyways, find() works like you suggested. thank you
[00:40:04] <Cork> but that table is more complicated so it takes a little more time to search it
[00:40:06] <ozoness> Hey guys. How can I do something like $form.on('submit', save.done(successCallback)); function save() { var $form = $(this); }; ?
[00:40:21] <ozoness> sorry save() returns $.ajax
[00:40:45] <Cork> ozoness: an anonymous function
[00:41:06] <Cork> 'submit', function() { save.call(this).done(); });
[00:41:14] <anli> I am trying to use $(window).innerWidth(), however, I do not get a different value when my phone is in landscape mode, how is that possible?
[00:41:48] <Cork> anli: cause mobile browsers move to lie about how the browser looks like
[00:42:02] <Cork> they have a "virtual" view port and a "real" viewport
[00:42:09] <Cork> innerWindow gives you the virtual one
[00:42:16] <anli> Which of them will media queries use?
[00:42:33] <Cork> the real one
[00:42:56] <anli> Do I need to specify the viewport having no scaling then?
[00:43:05] <Cork> no
[00:43:53] <anli> Seems like var w = Math.max(document.documentElement.clientWidth, window.innerWidth || 0) is the way
[00:44:06] <anli> Got 256 upvotes on SO
[00:44:30] <Uhkis> not enough jquery got more!
[00:45:36] <anli> ?

[00:49:37] <Cork> lol
[00:49:41] <Cork> O_o'
[00:49:58] <Cork> i love that the real answer has a -2 XD
[00:50:46] <Uhkis> Cork: no enough jquery! :D

[00:52:25] <doug16k> it doesn't (1,eval)(cmd) and print that?

[00:53:04] <doug16k> wow, didn't expect that!
[00:53:58] <doug16k> how did it not implicitly convert undefined to 0?
[01:00:09] <Cork> Uhkis: looking for backstory for that image gave me http://xkcd.com/221/ :D
[01:00:51] <Kartagis> lol
[01:01:13] <Uhkis> :)
[01:01:14] <Kartagis> very convenient
[01:02:21] <Kartagis> btw, is that post a parody?
[01:03:57] <Cork> Kartagis: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2694603/add-a-number-to-another-number-in-javascript <-- no

[01:26:36] <neanderslob> hi all, I seem to be running afoul of javascript by using the following in a conditional: personAttributes.length-1
[01:26:43] <neanderslob> where personAttributes is an array
[01:27:12] <neanderslob> the aim is to get a quantity one short of the array's length; how might I properly express that?
[01:28:50] <Cork> neanderslob: you seriously expect someone to be able to answer that?
[01:29:02] <Cork> there is absolutely no context at all in there
[01:29:07] <sacho> neanderslob, try personAttributes.length - 1
[01:29:27] <Cork> sacho: that is exactly the same thing
[01:29:59] <sacho> whoosh
[01:32:54] <neanderslob> sacho: na, didn't work thanks for the suggestion though
[01:33:10] <Cork> neanderslob: soo... context?
[01:33:31] <Cork> i currently suspect the answer is 42
[01:33:40] <Uhkis> not 4? :D
[01:33:47] <sacho> ?doesn't work
[01:33:52] * sacho doesn't know how to use b-ot
[01:34:41] <neanderslob> Cork: hey, I wasn't looking for the answer to life, the universe and everything; I was just interested in whether there was something obviously wrong with that particular syntax for trying to get a number equal to one less than the number of elements in an array
[01:34:50] <neanderslob> :-)
[01:35:00] <Cork> neanderslob: but you didn't even give the syntax
[01:35:06] <sacho> neanderslob, https://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html
[01:35:12] <Cork> you gave a fragment of it
[01:35:40] <sacho> you're not even past 1) yet :)
[01:36:44] <Uhkis> i bet the answer is: ()
[01:37:52] <neanderslob> alright, will provide more context
[01:40:42] <neanderslob> here's a little more context https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/5f2eb02077056e4c4306
[01:42:19] <Uhkis> it works fine if you set the variables
[01:43:04] <neanderslob> Uhkis: hi, is that directed at me?
[01:43:13] <Uhkis> yes
[01:44:11] <neanderslob> Uhkis: I would have thought so too; must have something else going on
[01:45:22] <neanderslob> Uhkis: thanks for having a look; just wanted to make sure I wasn't completely off on the syntax there
[01:46:10] <kongthap> i declare a function which return $.get(), i don't know how to call this function with callback, so i just use $.when(), http://pastie.org/9983867, i meant calling 2 functions with $.when() is fine, but if i wanted to call one function how to code?
[01:47:29] <Cork> neanderslob: if you get NaN it means .length == undefined or something else
[01:47:43] <Cork> neanderslob: and that in turn means personAttributes isn't an array
[01:48:27] <neanderslob> Cork: hmm, the interesting part is when I just take away the minus one, there's no problem
[01:48:43] <shwaiil> Q: when doing  $.ajax() GET request, there's an issue with getting the response from server, data[0] returned responseText but not on firefox then data[2].responseText seemed to fix the issue but IE stopped working. I'm wondering if it's related with the reserver not responding with the correct json headers maybe ?
[01:49:06] <DRSK> I'm trying to fetch an elements position in regards of how far the user has to scroll in order for it to be visible. Traditionally I'd make use of offset().top and be done with it, however on this particular site I've got elements horizontally as well; how do I count for the offset.left?
[01:49:09] <Cork> kongthap: just do loadTemplate().done(function(source) {});
[01:49:49] <kongthap> Cork, thanks, really didn't how :P
[01:49:55] <Cork> shwaiil: it is quite important that the server sets the correct content-type header
[01:50:30] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking, where can I read about this ? bcause I ahve to explain it to the server side guy, I used to do php and had a json_encode() method
[01:50:46] <Cork> DRSK: should work exactly the same
[01:51:18] <Cork> shwaiil: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type
[01:51:52] <shwaiil> cork how can I double check what response header type is right now set using the console ?
[01:52:28] <Cork> shwaiil: open the browsers network tab and check "response headers"
[01:52:31] <DRSK> Cork » well I'm using a library to "lock" elements so scrolling vertically actually moves horizontally for a set period of pixels; however if I simply run jQuery( '.elem' ).offset().top that returns false coords; it falls short most of the time. Although maybe it gets the offset in regards of the closest parent element it can find? Might have to try some more then, hmph.
[01:52:36] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks
[01:53:03] <Cork> shwaiil: it should read "Content-Type: application/json" (might have encoding after json)
[01:53:26] <Cork> shwaiil: and unless the "server guy" know what he does it most likely is "Content-Type: text/html"
[01:54:04] <shwaiil> Cork: ok I'll double check! So having it as text/html that's certainly what causes cross browser inconsistency
[01:54:30] <Cork> shwaiil: well there is other problems with what you wrote
[01:54:53] <Cork> so but hard to tell if it works as it should without seeing the code
[01:55:56] <shwaiil> Cork: http://pastie.org/9983880
[01:56:12] <Cork> ah
[01:56:15] <shwaiil> I usually don't do this, I get `data` and I use `data` if I'm not wrong
[01:56:22] <shwaiil> can't tell at the moment
[01:56:31] <Cork> shwaiil: you have to use callbacks
[01:56:37] <Cork> you can't access it on promise1
[01:57:00] <shwaiil> Cork:  http://pastie.org/9983882
[01:57:11] <shwaiil> yeah I'm using $.when() sorry
[02:01:11] <sacho> neanderslob, consider using a debugger and inspecting the values you're working with - https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging
[02:02:28] <Cork> shwaiil: when you run .done on when you get one argument for each response
[02:02:29] <neanderslob> sacho: cool, thanks for the link
[02:02:49] <Cork> so .done(function(respons1, respons2, respons3) {})
[02:03:09] <Cork> each response has the same argument numbers as .done directly on the request would do
[02:03:22] <Cork> so resposne1[0] == data
[02:03:45] <shwaiil> $.when(promise1, promise2, promise3, promise4).done(function (res1, res2, res3, res4) {     res1[0] == data  }
[02:03:46] <shwaiil> right ?
[02:03:54] <neanderslob> sacho: I'm slowly getting acclimated to using the debugging tools beyond just the console
[02:04:02] <shwaiil> yeah that one failed on firefox, that's why I had to change it. I use nightly and was working fine but the QA reported
[02:04:22] <Cork> shwaiil: http://jsfiddle.net/8bbqvo91/
[02:04:24] <shwaiil> so it must be the server not sending the right headers, I'll check that
[02:04:33] <Cork> shwaiil: right
[02:04:47] <Cork> shwaiil: don't go with "must be"
[02:04:50] <Cork> verify it
[02:04:54] <shwaiil> sure
[02:05:17] <shwaiil> but this is correct, right ? $.when(promise1, promise2, promise3, promise4).done(function (res1, res2, res3, res4) { res1[0] == data }
[02:05:27] <Cork> shwaiil: check the fiddle i gave you
[02:05:48] <shwaiil> ok thanks
[02:06:13] <sacho> can't access what, where
[02:12:52] <shwaiil> about a ajax request expecting json, I've got this on the response headers for my ajax GET call `HTTP/1.1 200 OK Connection: Keep-Alive Server: Day-Servlet-Engine/4.1.52 Date: Thu, 26 Feb 2015 10:10:37 GMT Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
[02:13:17] <Cork> that doesn't affect this
[02:13:30] <shwaiil> hum ok
[02:13:41] <Cork> the browser takes care of if the data is chinked
[02:13:58] <Cork> but ya, it COULD cause problem in browser, but i don't know if it does
[02:15:22] <shwaiil> not sure where the browser inconsistency is coming from really :T the problem is that I can't replicate  this on my firefox
[02:15:39] <shwaiil> res[0] !== data on firefox (non nightly), all other browsers work
[02:16:01] <Cork> shwaiil: can you reproduce the problem with the fiddle?
[02:16:02] <sacho> so what is res[0]
[02:16:03] <titii> Hi, I have a strange question. Can I protect some element from the (click) event which provide the next loaded javascript?
[02:16:11] <Cork> sacho: $.when().done()
[02:16:27] <sacho> shwaiil, what is the actual value of res[0] in that case
[02:16:29] <Cork> titii: "protect"?
[02:16:47] <titii> Cork: Yes, to ignore it
[02:16:49] <shwaiil> sacho: `document`
[02:16:51] <shwaiil> Cork: not really, the problem is that I can't really see this issue on my firefox
[02:17:09] <Cork> shwaiil: well ya if it is a cross browser problem you have to test in all browsers
[02:17:28] <sacho> shwaiil, what's the value of res?
[02:17:30] <Cork> titii: simplest is to add a class to those links and have an exception in the function doing the ajax call
[02:18:15] <shwaiil> sacho: just a second reverting this back to the previous version to get the response, the problem is that I'll have to ask somebody running non firefox nightly to get the response with the issue, but the [0] is basically document and not data
[02:18:23] <sacho> titii, you could try using the native stopImmediatePropagation
[02:20:15] <sacho> titii, http://jsfiddle.net/y136chh5/1/
[02:21:15] <Cork> stopping events is normally a really bad idea though
[02:21:22] <sacho> hmm, weird
[02:21:31] <sacho> I thought listeners were processed in reverse
[02:21:49] <sacho> titii, apparently you can just use jquery's event handlers as well
[02:21:51] <titii> sacho: looks very nice. ty
[02:21:57] <Cork> your mixing native and jquery events
[02:22:05] <Cork> and that... isn't really supported
[02:22:06] <sacho> titii, http://jsfiddle.net/y136chh5/2/
[02:22:31] <Cork> and again avoid blocking events
[02:22:39] <Cork> it has a high likelyhood of biting you later
[02:22:45] <Cork> (from own experience)
[02:24:58] <titii> sacho: it works perfect man, ty ^^
[02:25:06] <titii> Cork: ty
[02:25:22] <Cork> well ignore it if you want to...
[02:25:40] <shwaiil> Cork: sacho this is the response on firefox when expecting response[0] == data. This is what I get `[Document , "success", Object { readyState=4, responseXML=document, responseText="{"series":["9HLC","9HLB"...,"series":[2,2,2]}}}}\r\n", more...}]`
[02:25:42] <titii> Cork: i know, but this is only for one page
[02:25:49] <shwaiil> sorry I had to go to someone else's machine
[02:25:57] <Cork> titii: and that one page might still be what bites you later
[02:26:00] <shwaiil> can't replicate on my environment
[02:26:20] <shwaiil> this is the response on chrome ["{"series":["9HLC","9HLB","9HLD"],"options":{"Heati…el mounted audio controls","series":[2,2,2]}}}} ↵", "success", Object]
[02:26:24] <Cork> titii: the problem with blocking events is that you effectively states "i know that no other code section in this page won't ever want to know about this; for ever"
[02:26:26] <shwaiil> response[0] == data
[02:26:29] <sacho> oh, it was animation handlers that were processed backwards
[02:26:37] <Cork> and that an extreamly bold statement to make
[02:26:42] <titii> Cork: but the script with stop propagation is only for one page, u know
[02:26:56] <Cork> titii: what difference does that make?
[02:27:21] <Cork> if you ever need to add a new code snippet to that page, that for some reason needs to ex. track clicks
[02:27:26] <titii> Cork: I dont need any more events to do on this page
[02:27:30] <Cork> will break cause of this code snippet
[02:27:37] <Cork> and it will be close to impossible to find why
[02:27:42] <Cork> titii: for now
[02:27:45] <sacho> shwaiil, what jquery version?
[02:27:50] <titii> Cork: >|
[02:27:52] <Cork> you sure that will be true for the next 4 years?
[02:27:54] <titii> Cork: :)
[02:28:21] <titii> cork: i think so, it is specific
[02:28:23] <sacho> it will be close to impossible to find out, unless you use some debugging tools
[02:28:27] <Cork> for example google analytics tracking
[02:28:40] <sacho> which would make it trivial to find out :)
[02:29:00] <Cork> ya, i've been hitter hard by stopPropagation so i avoid it like the plague now days
[02:30:13] <titii> i am learned from that
[02:30:39] <shwaiil> sacho: jQuery JavaScript Library v1.8.1
[02:31:48] <toastyghost> the irc:// link to this channel on irc.jquery.org is causing me to go into a new channel called ##jquery for some reason
[02:32:19] <toastyghost> also, i'm curious as to why code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js is a thing for latest stable on the 1.x branch, but there doesn't appear to be any equivalent for the 2.x one
[02:32:53] <Cork> toastyghost: where do you see that link?
[02:33:25] <toastyghost> the irc link or the cdn link?
[02:34:07] <Cork> where?
[02:34:19] <Xatenev> toastyghost: links seem correct for me
[02:34:26] <Xatenev> going to #jquery
[02:34:31] <Cork> ya, all the links i can find looks fine here too
[02:34:31] <toastyghost> hmm that's weird
[02:34:36] <Cork> but i might be missing some
[02:34:59] <Cork> cause irc://irc.freenode.net/#jquery is correct
[02:35:06] <toastyghost> yeah hover text looks fine so it's probably my irc client being dumb
[02:35:11] <Xatenev> which irc client?
[02:35:34] <basichash> can i get a hand? I'm trying to make the boxes from (http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/multi-select-tiled-layout) into radios rather than checkboxes, but having some trouble
[02:35:44] <Cork> toastyghost: anyway the number unprefixed version is something ppl shouldn't use at the first place
[02:36:08] <Cork> toastyghost: but ppl started using the old one so it has to be kept for legacy reasons
[02:36:08] <toastyghost> mirc 7.38
[02:36:20] <Cork> actually
[02:36:23] <Cork> no
[02:36:26] <Cork> the link isn't correct
[02:36:32] <Cork> # isn't suppose to be in the link
[02:36:43] <Cork> the link should be irc://irc.freenode.net/jquery
[02:36:47] <toastyghost> oh
[02:36:53] <Xatenev> it depends on the irc client i think
[02:36:58] <Xatenev> my client poens the links correct
[02:37:01] <Xatenev> opens*
[02:37:03] <Cork> according to the spec for irc links
[02:37:15] <Xatenev> on pidgin i am getting a question to join channel
[02:37:17] <Xatenev> #jquery
[02:37:41] <toastyghost> i didn't realize the generic name for latest stable was done away with
[02:37:47] <Cork> Xatenev: some clients might drop invalid #
[02:37:58] <Xatenev> yea prob
[02:38:17] <toastyghost> i'll put a ticket in with the mirc dev in that case
[02:38:29] <sacho> toastyghost, jquery.min.js doesn't point to the latest stable on the 1.x branch
[02:38:42] <toastyghost> oh, it doesn't?
[02:39:56] <Cork> "Since most IRC channels begin with the '#' character which is unsafe in a URL, it must be encoded. To avoid the cumbersome
[02:39:56] <Cork>       % encoding for most references, this draft omits the specific mention of a channel prefix"
[02:40:05] <Cork> so ya, the link is wrong
[02:40:12] <toastyghost> you're right, it's one release behind
[02:40:30] <basichash> i don't understand, why is $('.searchable-container label')[0].removeClass('active') giving me "TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[02:40:45] <Cork> basichash: cause your unwrapping the element
[02:40:49] <Cork> use .eq(0)
[02:41:02] <Cork> [0] gives you the raw dom element, and it doesn't have the removeClass function
[02:41:17] <Cork> *cause you're
[02:42:36] <basichash> Cork: ah right thanks
[02:43:26] <basichash> Does this code look right? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c5f68e8bbc253d650225 i'm trying to make it so that when you click on a new label, all the other labels lose their .active class and the newly clicked label gets the class, but it doesn't seem to work
[02:45:14] <t4nk992>  http://jsfiddle.net/9hLxjyb6/2/  if someone can helps me ?
[02:45:36] <Cork> basichash: no, you shouldn't do it like that
[02:46:12] <Cork> basichash: replace line 4-6 with $('.searchable-container label.active').removeClass('.active')
[02:48:17] <basichash> Cork: great, thanks
[02:54:02] <shwaiil> sacho: Cork, about my issue, I've tested on the browser that where response[0] !== data, and I found that the jsfiddle works fine, the responseHeaders is set to `Content-Type	application/json`, while where I'm getting the issue is not set at all.
[02:54:34] <shwaiil> can this be related with server side then ?
[02:54:37] <Cork> shwaiil: ah, that would mean you default to the browser sniffing
[02:55:00] <Cork> so ya, i would ask him to add the missing content-type
[02:55:29] <Cork> and the correct key name is Content-Type not content-type btw
[02:55:34] <Cork> just so i don't confuse things
[03:03:14] <shwaiil> Cork: thank you so much for your attention, I'll request that!
[03:16:45] <t4nk992> http://jsfiddle.net/9hLxjyb6/2/ Everytime i select smthg on resultatDashboardInput input,it show demo1 or demo 2 or demo3.. how to avoid this ?
[03:27:32] <t4nk992> nobody has an idea?
[03:30:55] <basichash> t4nk992: what's the purpose of hiddenRow?
[03:31:18] <t4nk992> hmm nothing
[03:31:48] <basichash> also the reason hiddenRow is showing is because when you click on a select, you're still clicking inside the accordian header, which causes the accordian content to show
[03:32:35] <basichash> t4nk992: not sure what you're trying to achieve here, so i can't give you much more advice
[03:32:58] <t4nk992> i explain to you what i wany
[03:33:21] <basichash> why are you using an accordian?
[03:33:32] <t4nk992> when i click on a select i dont want to display the child content ?
[03:33:50] <t4nk992> u understand what i means ?
[03:35:01] <basichash> i just want to make sure you actually need to be using an accordian
[03:35:23] <basichash> t4nk992: what data do you want to put into the accordian content div?
[03:38:35] <zelol_> basichash sry i disconnected
[03:39:36] <zelol_> basichash when i click on select i dont want click on accordeon header
[03:52:10] <shwaiil> Cork: my issue was fixed by added the correct Content-Type, but I'm using JSON.parse(), I had to stringify the response. I guess I don't really need to use JSON.parse() right ? I can access the data straight away or it's safer to stringify and then json parse ?
[03:52:41] <Cork> shwaiil: correct
[03:52:59] <Cork> if the content-type is correct jquery will give you a parsed object/array instead of a string
[03:53:02] <shwaiil> Cork: thank you
[04:37:00] <rzeka> Anyone familiar here with Google Maps API? I wonder if it's possible to create a marker and on click, but thata into separate div instead of popup
[04:42:06] <basiclaser> hi guys
[04:42:10] <basiclaser> Is there any way of forcing the browser to think that the viewport is  a certain size?
[04:47:32] <aways_> Hey
[04:47:42] <aways_> Simple question I thinks
[04:47:57] <aways_> How it's possible to reencapsulate the addEvent function off Jquery
[04:48:00] <aways_> https://gist.github.com/BorisMorel/e1d4e5c36bfcb839809f
[04:48:06] <chargen> Hi. I'm trying to drag and drop an image and change the cursor to a grab hand while dragging but the OS/browser seems to override that cursor. How can I allow only my custom cursor?
[04:48:34] <aways_> I would like use my addEvent function to add an event on the jquery object
[04:48:34] <Cork> aways_: reencapsulate?
[04:48:37] <Cork> what do you mean by that?
[04:48:49] <aways_> Cork, i don't known how to describe it
[04:49:05] <aways_> My gist can help you to understand
[04:49:11] <Cork> sadly no
[04:49:33] <Cork> what you have there should work as far as i can tell
[04:49:34] <chargen> Do you mean to overwrite the previous event function?
[04:49:36] <aways_> I don't known how can add one level for the method like .on()
[04:49:47] <Cork> except you don't take a callback to give to on
[04:50:16] <aways_> In the fact i could write
[04:50:40] <Cork> aways_: is this what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/rvjuzx2u/
[04:50:43] <aways_> canvas.addEvent('mousemouve', function(e) { console.log(e.pageY) });
[04:51:06] <aways_> Cork, yep
[04:51:21] <aways_> But the e var isn't define ?
[04:51:29] <Cork> it will be
[04:51:38] <chargen> Cork: Please. Can you help me? I can't find a solution for it. I've tried many things.
[04:51:47] <aways_> Cork, how ?
[04:52:02] <Cork> aways_: .on passes the argument
[04:52:10] <Cork> aways_: you define the name of the argument
[04:52:15] <aways_> So thanks !
[04:52:17] <aways_> Ok !

[05:16:41] <imox> without any css
[05:16:46] <gtristan> imox, I'm even seeing SO posts of people referring to that exact plugin
[05:16:47] <aways_> Cork, abs 10 mins

[05:50:49] <Surfoo> pyCasso: http://jsfiddle.net/43oLq1wo/5/
[05:58:57] <pyCasso> thanks for the help surfoo: the [] and {} was confusing. Should i be able to pass the $resutls into the ajax data param??
[06:04:05] <Surfoo> pyCasso: yep, you can give results to the data param
[06:05:13] <Surfoo> pyCasso: read the doc : http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[06:05:22] <Surfoo> data
[06:05:24] <Surfoo> Type: PlainObject or String or Array
[06:05:38] <pyCasso> var foo = [] is an array and var bar = {} is an object??
[06:05:58] <Surfoo> pyCasso: yes
[06:08:08] <aways_> Cork, Ok sorry.. My fault
[06:08:23] <aways_> console.log(move) --> maybe ('move') better

[06:12:17] <pyCasso> Surfoo: thanks again, good stuff mane! i would have never came to the conclusion on line 4 of your code.
[06:17:52] <pyCasso> surfoo: if i wanted to push one additional value into the array. results.push(submitBtnValue); ??

[06:35:42] <RusAlex> q: have not undertand what $('body').on('keyup.bbm', handler) notation means ?
[06:35:58] <RusAlex> keyup in nodes with class="bbm" ?
[06:36:17] <RusAlex> there is no .bbm on my page but handler runs
[06:39:51] <Surfoo> pyCasso: http://jsfiddle.net/43oLq1wo/6/
[06:42:12] <pyCasso> surfoo..yet again, mind blown. can you explain line 6??
[06:44:15] <pyCasso> why not userinputs['submitbutton] = $('input[type="submit"]).val()]
[06:44:21] <Surfoo> pyCasso: _submit is the key in the object, et then I get the value of the submit input
[06:44:32] <Surfoo> it's an object, not an array
[06:45:46] <pyCasso> so what is ._submit ??
[06:46:16] <Surfoo> the name of the key in userinputs
[06:46:34] <Surfoo> you can write what you want instead of _submit
[06:47:27] <Surfoo> I added a _, because it's not input data, but an action button
[06:49:11] <pyCasso> i see its a variable placeholder. is the _ a jquery contextual value? meaning it assigns specific properties??
[06:54:06] <Surfoo> pyCasso: nope
[07:20:26] <Surfoo> I'd to use a promise with a create event for a selectmenu (it's an ajax request the create event). How can I do that in your opinion?
[07:26:59] <cjohnson> if you're using $.ajax it already returns a deferred
[07:27:02] <cjohnson> which is like a promise
[07:27:29] <cjohnson> so just return that...then you can do createEvent(...).then(function() { ... })
[07:30:18] <mbrzuzy> You can also use $.ajax({}).done(function() { });
[07:30:36] <cjohnson> is done the same as then?
[07:31:19] <mbrzuzy> not exactly
[07:31:25] <cjohnson> how does it differ?
[07:31:46] <mbrzuzy> $.ajax({}).then(onDone() { }, onFail() {})
[07:31:59] <mbrzuzy> $.ajax({}).done(function(){}).fail(function() {})
[07:32:27] <cjohnson> ah, I see
[07:41:37] <sacho> .done() and .fail() don't return a new promise.
[07:49:54] <Cryp71c> Inherited a project, not sure whether what its doing is "best practice" and want opinions / discussion on it. All javascript events are done via bindings in .js files using JS selectors. Looking at the source, there is nothing at all indicating that there is a bound event. This is all built leveraging AJAX and there are a very large number of .js files with these sorts of bindings. It seems rather elaborate and hard to follow / hard to find the specific
[07:49:54] <Cryp71c> binding you're looking for.
[07:50:05] <Cryp71c> Is this best practice? is there something better?
[07:50:36] <Cryp71c> looking at the HTML source, there is nothing at all...*
[07:53:05] <dcherman> mbrzuzy: fwiw i wouldn't use that example wrt done/fail/then going forward - there's a big behaviour change coming in jQuery 3.0 where the implementation of those methods will be very different.  `.then` should likely be preferred in almost all cases ( the *only* except being .done/.fail for sync xhr )
[07:54:40] <mbrzuzy> Thanks dcherman, that's good to know
[07:56:54] <xec> Cryp71c: it kind of... depends. If you have an old school web page, you might want it to function even if users have disabled JS, and this is easier to achieve when you do not mix JS and HTML in the same file
[07:57:26] <cjohnson> sacho: .then returns an already-fulfilled promise?
[07:57:39] <cjohnson> with the value of the return in then, right
[07:57:45] <Cryp71c> xec, I think we can discard that. This application requires JS, none of the AJAX has any fallback behavior
[07:58:37] <xec> Cryp71c: right. then you may opt for a different approach, using client-side templating and/or some sort of data binding
[07:58:41] <cjohnson> Cryp71c: I like to keep the bindings mostly in JS
[07:58:50] <cjohnson> but I usually indicate the binding through an id or data- attribute
[07:58:54] <cjohnson> data-role=submit
[07:59:23] <cjohnson> then I do $(ancestorOrDocument).on('click', [data-role=submit]', function() { ... })
[07:59:30] <basichash> How can i prevent a form from being submitted when you press enter, only when clicking a button?
[07:59:53] <xec> Cryp71c: this seems to be the trend with frameworks like angular.js or libs like knockout.js
[07:59:53] <cjohnson> on keydown on the form, detect enter keys, and e.preventDefault()
[07:59:57] <cjohnson> basichash ^
[08:00:11] <xec> Cryp71c: have a look at the view code at http://knockoutjs.com/examples/simpleList.html for example
[08:00:23] <basichash> got this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/75c4ec868d08924c6022
[08:00:28] <basichash> how can i detect enter key?
[08:00:54] <cjohnson> I don't see "keydown" there
[08:01:20] <cjohnson> once you're handling that event, console.log e.charCode or e.keyCode
[08:01:22] <basiclaser> when you specifify a class with the jquery $("selector"), does it imply a 'foreach' / 'each' behaviour?
[08:01:22] <cjohnson> I forget which
[08:01:28] <cjohnson> look for the number you get when you p[ress enter
[08:01:44] <cjohnson> basichash: the things you call on it are what dictate the "each" behavior
[08:02:01] <sacho> basiclaser, you'll select all elements with that class, yes
[08:02:12] <cjohnson> basiclaser** I meant
[08:02:13] <Cryp71c> xec, cjohnson, I understand its not a popular / respected choice, but why is in-line javascript method calls disliked?
[08:02:31] <basiclaser> sacho: so $(".example").each is redundant?
[08:02:32] <cjohnson> for one, you're littering your JS throughout your HTML
[08:02:43] <cjohnson> it makes it harder to bind variables and pass them around as well
[08:02:44] <xec> Cryp71c: i assume you're talking about the native onclick="" etc?
[08:02:51] <sacho> basiclaser, that depends on what you want to do..?
[08:02:58] <Cryp71c> xec, yes
[08:03:05] <cjohnson> basiclaser: like I said, it depends what methods you're calling on the collection
[08:03:13] <cjohnson> some methods only expect one item, some work on collections
[08:04:00] <basichash> cjohnson: should it stop me from typing?
[08:04:00] <cjohnson> if I wanted to prepend the word "id-" to all elements in a collection, you wouldh ave to use .each so you could work with each element's ID in its own scope
[08:04:12] <cjohnson> basichash: ?
[08:04:33] <basiclaser> laserhash:
[08:04:33] <basichash> using $("#thing input").keydown() stops the the form submitting, but doesn't allow me to type (for obvious reaosns)
[08:04:57] <microhaxo> guys, i am changing the scale of a div for viewing a page, i want the scrollbar to maintain the correct position as i scale in and out, currently the page just grows larger and longer and the scrollbar no longer keeps the original position in view.
[08:05:12] <sacho> Cryp71c, on* attributes always use the global scope to execute their given javascript.
[08:05:16] <cjohnson> basichash: that code shouldn't stop you from typing unless your handler is wrong
[08:05:26] <xec> Cryp71c: a couple of reasons. first being scope. if you want to call a function from the attribute you need it to be global - and the global scope gets littered quick - does not scale.
[08:05:28] <microhaxo> I thought this might work: $(window).scrollTop($(window).scrollTop() * self.scale);  and it only works for the first scale increment of .10
[08:05:30] <microhaxo> then it breaks.
[08:05:42] <cjohnson> paste real code that you're using basichash
[08:05:50] <basichash> cjohnson: it's e.preventDefault();
[08:06:21] <cjohnson> think this through basichash
[08:06:28] <cjohnson> you want to preventDefault only if the key is enter
[08:06:28] <basichash> cjohnson: got it
[08:06:34] <cjohnson> so you need an if check obviously
[08:06:40] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/t8bfnoLt/1/
[08:08:18] <Cryp71c> xec, does littering the global scope result in performance degradation?
[08:08:18] <xec> Cryp71c: you can also only have a single handler of a type for an element
[08:08:52] <cjohnson> Cryp71c: it's bad practice. all JS runs in the same context
[08:08:53] <xec> Cryp71c: not that i know of, but it is hell to manage and a source to hard-to-find bugs
[08:08:57] <cjohnson> you can break other people's code easily
[08:09:31] <demifuror> hi guys. is it possible in jquery to have a link, which when clicked on, changes to a text field? i have to add a link to a page called "User ID". when the user clicks this think, i want the link to be replaced with a text field containing the user id...is this possible?
[08:11:26] <tandroid> demifuror: you could just add a class to the link and text field to add display:none; when you click.
[08:13:04] <LucaS05> hi. i've included selec2 internationalization file after select2 in my page
[08:13:16] <LucaS05> but i still see the strings in english
[08:13:56] <LucaS05> someone has faced internationalization problem with select2?
[08:13:59] <cjohnson> demifuror: what have you tried so far?
[08:14:47] <xec> Cryp71c: for the record, separating js from html entirely is often referred to as "unobtrusive" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript
[08:15:07] <LucaS05> ok. i've found the problem, there's a language property for the initialization
[08:15:15] * AdamPDotty gets his dictionary
[08:15:33] <AdamPDotty> so English is an international language?
[08:16:26] <xec> well, it's not only spoken in england, if that's what you mean ;)
[08:16:29] <BinaryKitten> as far as many nations people speak it
[08:16:35] <Cryp71c> xec, most likely the issue for this project is its JS organization. lots of JS files are generally-named and dumped into a js directory so finding out what bindings *should* apply to a specific view (or even object) is absolute guesswork.
[08:16:41] <Cryp71c> And lots of project-wide searching.
[08:18:45] <anasule> I have some buttons on a page that save text ive attached click function to them and i need one at the bottom of the page that updates all of them my onclick function is $('.update-text').click(function(e) { how would i click all buttons with the update-text class to make an update all button?
[08:19:16] <arthurvr> Hi anasule!
[08:19:24] <AdamPDotty> you attach the handler to a container
[08:20:10] <AdamPDotty> ah that helps but does not answer the question
[08:20:13] <cjohnson> Cryp71c: yeah, that's an issue. my project is set up so views have their own js files for any page-specific logic (so i have app/views/users/edit.ctp and app/webroot/js/views/users/edit.js) and then I have larger modules that get used side-wide in app/webroot/js/app
[08:20:18] <basichash> cjohnson: thanks
[08:20:31] <cjohnson> app/webroot/js/app/user.js for instance, would contain some js for users that are used throughout the site
[08:20:45] <AdamPDotty> then something like $('.update-text').click();
[08:21:02] <AdamPDotty> you call the handler
[08:21:46] <anasule> AdamPDotty: I think i get the idea im going to give it a try niw
[08:21:49] <anasule> now*
[08:23:33] <Cryp71c> cjohnson, any specific examples that might cement that distinguishing organization? What JS would you need pertaining to users that's used throughout the site?
[08:23:39] <xec> Cryp71c: unfortunately, that's often the case. Personally I find JavaScript (and jQuery) lends itself to code-as-you-go-along and once people get stuff working they rarely go back to clean up. I do much of what cjohnson just said, in addition to the data-binding in view templates, makes it easier to go back later.
[08:25:47] <xec> i gotta go. good luck
[08:28:12] <cjohnson> Cryp71c: well for instance, we have a user "badge" that's shown all throughout the site -- next to their ticket comments, next to their associations, etc. those badges have a little edit button that lets you edit the user inline
[08:28:29] <cjohnson> so the JS to bind the edit button and the ajax request to get the edit form is in app/users.js
[08:41:56] <Surfoo> how I can get the key of an object when I have a value?
[08:42:37] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() or something similar to get what you want.
[08:43:30] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to semi-abuse the object to do it, but it's possible.
[08:43:47] <robertmaxrees> though that sounds backwards now that i think about it.
[08:45:20] <robertmaxrees> Surfoo something like this: jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tyto8cxp/
[08:53:00] <cjohnson> bad data design generally
[08:59:50] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson aye.
[09:00:24] <Surfoo> robertmaxrees: thanks !
[09:00:50] <robertmaxrees> Surfoo i'd maybe rething your data format though.
[09:01:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it might be inverted.
[09:01:55] <Surfoo> my database schema is weird, but I can't change it :/
[09:02:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd transform it before shipping it to the browser, but meh.
[09:11:11] <_DB> how can I add another class to a div that already has classes in it?
[09:11:17] <robertmaxrees> .addClass()
[09:11:21] <_DB> I dont want to overwrite just append it
[09:11:23] <_DB> ah ok
[09:18:24] <Junior`> hello
[09:18:32] <robertmaxrees> good morning!
[09:19:31] <Junior`> I have a phone number that is in a span and contains : 2222222222 . How can i apply this -> $('.staff-user').inputmask('(999) 999-9999'); (taking into account that it's a span and not an input) -> just asking if it's possible to do the masking in a span. Thanks!
[09:20:27] <cjohnson> _DB you should really check out the jquery docs
[09:20:44] <robertmaxrees> Junior` by virtue of its design, no.
[09:20:55] <robertmaxrees> you could copy the contents to an input, apply the mask, and then copy them back over.
[09:21:01] <_DB> Yeah im planing to re-learn all the stuff Its been a few years since I messed with web design
[09:21:08] <Junior`> that's why i asked, so that i don't lose time
[09:21:28] <Junior`> but haven't thought at that, which might do the trick, so thank you robertmaxrees
[09:21:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:23:07] <Junior`> but i might do it easier in php directly,
[09:23:29] <robertmaxrees> that's probably smarter.
[09:58:18] <frabblerock> QUestion. I know the problem but not the solution. So I'm loading in content when a user clicks a button, that button is also part of the content I'm refreshing the page with because it has a different href every LOAD.
[09:58:34] <frabblerock> but whats happening is its event is onyl working every other click
[09:58:38] <frabblerock> for example
[09:58:42] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[09:59:02] <frabblerock> http://pastebin.com/K3LENsMw
[09:59:48] <robertmaxrees> you're caching the objects and binding to the cached versions - i'm guessing that's your problem.
[10:02:03] <frabblerock> that wouldn't work every other click would it?
[10:02:43] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about the arrows for the dates?
[10:02:56] <robertmaxrees> because it's working the first time, then causing the page to reload the second.
[10:03:33] <frabblerock> yep
[10:03:38] <frabblerock> then it works the third time
[10:03:39] <frabblerock> fails the 4th
[10:03:39] <robertmaxrees> right, that's the problem.
[10:03:42] <frabblerock> works the 5th time
[10:03:43] <frabblerock> so on
[10:03:44] <robertmaxrees> but the page reloaded.
[10:03:56] <robertmaxrees> so it works the first time, then fails.
[10:04:03] <frabblerock> click it the third time?
[10:04:08] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:04:10] <robertmaxrees> so the "3rd time" is a new page.
[10:04:16] <robertmaxrees> no context of what came before.
[10:04:22] <frabblerock> so how do you resolve this?
[10:04:32] <robertmaxrees> event delegation.
[10:05:09] <robertmaxrees> instead of directly binding to those elements - http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:05:17] <frabblerock> tried that
[10:05:34] <robertmaxrees> what did you do?
[10:06:07] <robertmaxrees> did you bind to an element that exists on pageload and persists thereafter, never getting replaced?
[10:07:27] <frabblerock> i know im not suppose to do this
[10:07:29] <frabblerock> but to be specific
[10:07:30] <frabblerock>         els = {
[10:07:30] <frabblerock>             next: ('.date-picker .next')
[10:07:30] <frabblerock>         };
[10:07:33] <frabblerock>         els.next.on('click', 'a', function() {
[10:07:33] <frabblerock>             // do something
[10:07:34] <frabblerock>         });
[10:07:47] <robertmaxrees> please don't multiline paste.
[10:07:56] <frabblerock> 13:07:27]  <frabblerock>	i know im not suppose to do this
[10:08:03] <robertmaxrees> so you did it anyway? ;)
[10:08:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[10:08:27] <robertmaxrees> it looks like .date-picker is part of what's getting replaces.
[10:08:30] <robertmaxrees> *replaced
[10:08:58] <frabblerock> it is
[10:09:15] <robertmaxrees> so the initial object needs to persist.
[10:09:17] <robertmaxrees> it can't be replaced.
[10:09:22] <frabblerock> it can't.
[10:09:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:09:33] <robertmaxrees> so you change what you're binding to .
[10:09:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the element you're replacing on the page?
[10:10:17] <frabblerock> you click the arrow, which has an a tag, i click it, store the href in a variable, empty the page, load the content from that href onto the page
[10:10:28] <robertmaxrees> "onto the page" - what element?
[10:10:44] <frabblerock> everything
[10:10:56] <frabblerock> each arrow has a new href
[10:10:59] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:11:01] <frabblerock> that im loading content from
[10:11:16] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's els.wrapper
[10:11:26] <frabblerock> yeah
[10:11:28] <robertmaxrees> right? that's the element you're loading the new content into, right?
[10:11:31] <frabblerock> i empty everything inside the wrapper
[10:11:34] <stylica> hi
[10:11:37] <stylica> So a callback can use this to retrieve an element (jquery). However, I had to wrap it into a closure for passing further arguments. But now this isn't the element anymore but window instead. How can I fix this?
[10:11:38] <frabblerock> then load the new content into it.
[10:11:44] <robertmaxrees> right, so you need to do $('#main .wrapper').on('click'
[10:11:55] <mezod> which is the simplest way to decrement a textNode? something like $('#'+from).find('#counter').text()--; :p
[10:12:06] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock right, so you need to do $('#main .wrapper').on('click', '.date-picker .prev a', function() {}); instead
[10:12:15] <frabblerock> why does that work?
[10:12:25] <robertmaxrees> because the element you're binding to doesn't get replaced.
[10:12:27] <robertmaxrees> it's "static"./
[10:12:35] <robertmaxrees> the binding it happening to the parent object.
[10:12:44] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it in pretty good detail.
[10:12:54] <robertmaxrees> stylica can you show an example?
[10:13:02] <robertmaxrees> mezod you'll need to use .each();
[10:13:32] <robertmaxrees> mezod unless you mean a one-off decrement, in which case you'll need to pass the text to parseInt() and then decrement that.
[10:14:38] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[10:14:42] <frabblerock> that doesn't seem to work
[10:14:46] <mezod> robertmaxrees: yeah I mean one-off, right now I have http://pastie.org/9985364, but was wondering if it could be done with one line
[10:14:57] <frabblerock> it looks like it is firing twice with one click now
[10:15:11] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock you have a console error now.
[10:15:18] <cjohnson> stylica: check out apply/call/bind
[10:15:27] <frabblerock> im not seeing an error
[10:15:30] <frabblerock> what are you seeing
[10:15:47] <robertmaxrees> interestiong, it went away.
[10:16:05] <robertmaxrees> and don't re-run the bindings.
[10:16:11] <robertmaxrees> run them once.
[10:16:38] <frabblerock> how am I re running them
[10:16:57] <robertmaxrees> that's the only way they'd run twice.
[10:17:07] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure you're not accidentally re-including the script for them.
[10:17:16] <frabblerock> im not.
[10:17:55] <frabblerock> http://pastie.org/9985378
[10:17:59] <cjohnson> stylica: http://jsfiddle.net/1zyu0xuw/
[10:18:02] <robertmaxrees> wait why do you think it's running twice?
[10:18:14] <cjohnson> stylica: you can use bind to override what "this" means for a function
[10:18:23] <frabblerock> i have no idea
[10:18:31] <robertmaxrees> ... then why would you say that?
[10:18:43] <frabblerock> it looks like it's the click event is firing both next and prev
[10:19:01] <robertmaxrees> ohj, prev and next need to be strings.
[10:19:04] <robertmaxrees> not jquery objects.
[10:19:06] <robertmaxrees> per the docs.
[10:20:26] <frabblerock> okay
[10:20:27] <frabblerock> well
[10:20:39] <frabblerock> now its just reloading in the same content.
[10:21:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so fix that part now.
[10:22:00] <robertmaxrees> build.js on your dev site still looks wrong.
[10:22:14] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you did.
[10:22:46] <robertmaxrees> var url = $(els.next).attr('href'), isn't what you want any more.
[10:22:56] <robertmaxrees> try var url = $(this).attr('href'),
[10:24:01] <frabblerock> wonderful.
[10:24:17] <robertmaxrees> also, els.next was already a jquery object - no reason to pass it to $() again.
[10:24:22] <frabblerock> but why? because this refers to the click and the el refered to a stored url?
[10:24:39] <robertmaxrees> the $(this) is the jquery-fied element the event emitted from.
[10:24:51] <stylica> hm, it doesn't look like jquery will be replaced by vanilla js soon
[10:24:53] <robertmaxrees> your els.next was the element that was cached on pageload.
[10:25:09] <frabblerock> yeah
[10:25:10] <frabblerock> that makes sense.
[10:25:31] <frabblerock> is there anyway to combine this into one function so im not repeating the same code
[10:25:38] <frabblerock> and just update the elements?
[10:26:03] <cjohnson> stylica: jquery is just a library. one won't "replace" the other. you just choose to use the jquery library on some projects and not on others
[10:26:17] <frabblerock> i tried but the way the url is being stored made it difficult
[10:26:36] <cjohnson> the native DOM is getting better but it's still very verbose and there's a lot of boilerplate. but a lot of people also use jquery when a single helper function to reduce boilerplate would work well
[10:28:18] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock there's really no difference between the previous and next buttons.
[10:28:33] <robertmaxrees> you could give them a shared class and bind one listener to that instead.
[10:28:46] <frabblerock> you're right
[10:29:36] <checkit_> Need some jquery pro guidance... Trying to push one object into another. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/rLoL5jae/
[10:29:53] <robertmaxrees> what is "spending", checkit_?
[10:30:17] <robertmaxrees> it's not defined in that fiddle.
[10:30:25] <checkit_> Oops: http://jsfiddle.net/rLoL5jae/1/

[10:30:35] <robertmaxrees> [2015:02:26:10:29:53] <robertmaxrees> what is "spending", checkit_?

[10:30:36] <robertmaxrees> woops
[10:30:42] <robertmaxrees> var spending = [];
[10:31:00] <robertmaxrees> {} is for objects. objects don't have a .push() method available.  arrays, do.  [] is for arrays.
[10:32:09] <checkit_> That is what I thought but it isn't working in my script...
[10:32:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLoL5jae/2/ works here.
[10:32:50] <checkit_> I see.
[10:39:39] <stylica> So I do a toggleClass 2x to remove + re-add a css class to kick off an animation, I also tried removeClass+addClass.
[10:39:54] <stylica> However, it seems that jquery queues the actions and so it just adds the class (aka doing nothing on the dom).
[10:40:01] <stylica> Is there a way to force jquery to apply the actions?
[10:40:21] <stylica> .toggleClass('someclass').force().toggleClass('someclass') ?
[10:40:28] <stylica> or flush action queue?
[10:40:39] <stylica> I guess jquery got one because when I do toggleClass twice manually, it works.
[10:42:30] <sacho> a css animation?
[10:42:52] <cjohnson> a single toggle class hould work fine
[10:43:23] <cjohnson> oh wait I see what you mean. toggle off then toggle back on to re-add
[10:44:06] <sacho> stylica, I think you need to listen to transitionend
[10:45:12] <shoky> stylica it's not jquery doing it, it's the browser. also, https://css-tricks.com/restart-css-animation/
[10:47:12] <stylica> aha
[11:06:22] <pilotbob> Hi all.. given a tr I want to find the tr that comes before it with a specific lass. prev(".myclass") doesn't work. I assume because the prev one doesn't match that selector.
[11:07:54] <pilotbob> if easier, I want to find the span that is in a tr that is a previous tr to the span that I have the element of.
[11:08:28] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prevuntil/ is a hacky way to get it.
[11:09:40] <pilotbob> hmm... maybe prevAll(".myclass:first")   ????
[11:09:41] <shoky> $(span).closest('tr').prevAll('.myclass').first().find('span.spanclass')
[11:09:47] <shoky> yep!
[11:10:10] <pilotbob> shoky: thanks...
[11:10:41] <pilotbob> should it be :first or .first() I'm not sure the diff.
[11:10:59] <shoky> i always go for .first()
[11:11:14] <robertmaxrees> methods are generally faster.
[11:11:25] <robertmaxrees> selectors a little slower and harder to read.
[11:12:00] <pilotbob> shoky: thanks again.
[11:12:19] <shoky> sure
[11:14:48] <basiclaser> hey guys could you help me get this running: I am trying to switch all column classes to XS http://jsbin.com/vojigo/1/watch?html,js,console
[11:14:55] <basiclaser> it's almost there,
[11:15:22] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[11:15:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's always col-xs-thenumber ?
[11:16:31] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees:  that's right
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> theClass = $(this).prop('class').split('-')[1] = 'xs';  $(this).prop('class', theClass.join('-'));
[11:17:20] <basiclaser> I'm not sure how to do the class substring selector without the '6to5' javascript thing selected, and I can't quite add the newly created class to each elements classList
[11:17:29] <robertmaxrees> unless you need to account for there being more than one class at a time.
[11:17:54] <robertmaxrees> also, you can't use hyphens in varnames
[11:18:14] <_DB> _____ underscores are acceptable
[11:18:32] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees i really appreciate your help
[11:18:42] <frabblerock> but it looks like this breaks the filtering now
[11:18:45] <frabblerock> :(
[11:18:54] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably have to reinit the filtering on each page.
[11:19:25] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: thanks! But yeh, I will unfortunately have to account for multiple classes
[11:19:38] <frabblerock> how do i do that?
[11:20:19] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock wrap all the stuff that initializes the code in a function and call that in the .done() callback of that load.
[11:20:19] <basiclaser> _DB: I've got it sort of working here, not sure how to append the new class to the classList though
[11:20:25] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser .addClass()
[11:20:47] <robertmaxrees> but i'd rethink your strategory here, basiclaser
[11:20:59] <robertmaxrees> *strategy
[11:22:40] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: thanks, yeh it is a hack. I had to do alot of dev on a site that was started responsively with bootstrap then the second half was finished with custom absolute values, so it explodes on different viewports
[11:22:58] <robertmaxrees> okay - let me show you the (imo) easier way to do this.  one sec.
[11:23:06] <basiclaser> So for now I'm neutralising all the bootstrap responsive, i hope, by switching all classes to xs
[11:25:00] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees, are you saying i need to put all of this code
[11:25:01] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/assets/scripts/shuffle.js
[11:25:08] <robertmaxrees> no.how
[11:25:08] <frabblerock> into the date-picker.js file?
[11:25:09] <robertmaxrees> *no
[11:25:28] <robertmaxrees> you should have other code that you're running to init that shuffle.
[11:26:41] <frabblerock> im trying to run filter.init in the callband for the load
[11:26:45] <frabblerock> but its not having any effect
[11:26:57] <robertmaxrees> there would have been more code than this.
[11:27:00] <robertmaxrees> *that
[11:27:01] <frabblerock> i feel like it should work since all of that code goes into a build.js file
[11:27:10] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't all re-run magically.
[11:27:28] <robertmaxrees> yopu're basically removing every reference in the page out from under that code, so you have to redo all the work you did initially to get things to work.
[11:27:49] <frabblerock> oh man, im lost here
[11:27:56] <frabblerock> rewrite all of that in the callback?
[11:28:03] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock don't rewrite anything.
[11:28:07] <robertmaxrees> linky to the js file.
[11:28:11] <robertmaxrees> not shuffle, tjhe other one.
[11:28:40] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/assets/scripts/date-switcher.js
[11:28:56] <robertmaxrees> ... the stuff for the shuffle code.
[11:29:00] <robertmaxrees> your stuff for it.
[11:29:45] <frabblerock> ?
[11:29:59] <frabblerock> that was this
[11:30:00] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/assets/scripts/shuffle.js
[11:30:05] <robertmaxrees> did you just drop in shuffle.js and everything magically just worked?
[11:30:38] <frabblerock> this is my file for shuffle
[11:30:40] <robertmaxrees> take out the doc ready stuff, wrap that code in a function call, and then run those to get things to work.
[11:30:42] <frabblerock> not the actual library
[11:31:21] <robertmaxrees> basichash i haven't forgotten about you.
[11:31:25] <robertmaxrees> *basiclaser, sorry
[11:32:07] <basiclaser> haha..
[11:32:40] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: please, I'm in no hurry. I think i have something working
[11:33:22] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser i was basically going to use a bunch of .split() calls to give you what you want.
[11:33:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of substrings and stuff,
[11:35:32] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: cool. what would the main difference betwen substrings and split be?
[11:35:41] <basiclaser> here she is the beauty http://jsbin.com/vojigo/3/edit?html,js,console
[11:35:52] <robertmaxrees> splits let you work with arrays.
[11:35:57] <robertmaxrees> it's a little less awkward.
[11:38:13] <basiclaser> oh i see ! thats good to know in any case, thankyou
[11:43:38] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees, wrap filter.init(); in a function?
[11:43:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:44:07] <robertmaxrees> var filter = function() {
[11:44:14] <robertmaxrees> end that with }
[11:44:26] <robertmaxrees> run that.
[11:45:50] <robertmaxrees> you have to re-run all of that code when you replace the page contents.
[11:45:53] <ul71m0> hi im using this tabs http://jsfiddle.net/syahrasi/Us8uc/ but i need to link to tab4 from external page. For example www.mysite.com/page-tabs#tab-4 but it takes me to first time all the time
[11:46:28] <frabblerock> im sorry - end filter with }?
[11:46:34] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 detect window.location.hash on pageload and show the appropriate tab from there.
[11:46:49] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock link to the original js. i'll show you what i mean.
[11:47:55] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/assets/scripts/shuffle.js
[11:48:00] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: tried that but with no luck, any chance that you can edit fiddle
[11:48:25] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 it's not going to work properly in the fiddle because it can't see the correct window.location.hash iirc.
[11:48:29] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried.
[11:49:07] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock this is all setup backwards >.>
[11:49:24] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: http://pastie.org/9985615
[11:49:56] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock it'll look something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/tsu6ce3/
[11:50:10] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 on pageload.
[11:50:14] <robertmaxrees> not in the click event handler.
[11:51:09] <frabblerock> abd then run filter() in the callback?
[11:51:20] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock yes.  .done(filter) should work
[11:52:45] <frabblerock> els.wrapper.load(toLoad, filter);
[11:52:47] <frabblerock> like that?
[11:52:51] <robertmaxrees> prolly.
[11:52:54] <frabblerock> works - but its insanely slow
[11:53:16] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.  the ajax load is going to take some time and then the filter has to redo everything.
[11:53:24] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: wont work even if i puy iy in document ready
[11:53:28] <frabblerock> blah
[11:53:33] <frabblerock> that's not ideal
[11:53:39] <frabblerock> is there a better, faster way to do it?
[11:53:41] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock it's what you're building ;)
[11:53:59] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what the shuffle code does, so not sure.
[11:54:04] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 show me what you dod.
[11:54:05] <robertmaxrees> *did
[11:54:12] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle preferably - it's fine if it doesn't work.
[11:54:46] <frabblerock> robermaxrees - go http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events
[11:54:50] <frabblerock> go to a next date
[11:54:53] <frabblerock> then select a category
[11:54:56] <frabblerock> youll see what i mean
[11:55:02] <frabblerock> loading the event isn't slow
[11:55:06] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: http://pastie.org/9985632
[11:55:08] <frabblerock> actually filtering is slow
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> in general?
[11:55:53] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 check the selector and make sure it's valid.
[11:56:28] <frabblerock> seems like there is something going on there
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd see if there's a way to destory the previous shuffle.
[11:56:50] <robertmaxrees> i'lll bet it's not made to do what you're doing.
[11:57:23] <frabblerock> no
[11:57:25] <frabblerock> you can destroy it
[11:57:28] <frabblerock> also
[11:57:38] <frabblerock> running filter.init seemed to do the trick
[11:58:08] <frabblerock> actually nvm lol
[11:58:15] <frabblerock> it broke it
[11:59:10] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: lol it was tab_content and it should be tab-content
[11:59:13] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees++
[11:59:15] <ul71m0> thanks :)
[12:00:07] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: bad thing here is that it acts like anchor tag too so it takes me to specifi part of the page, and i want it on top...
[12:00:59] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 change your event binding to run an e.preventDefault();
[12:01:13] <robertmaxrees> which you have already anyway... that should work fine.
[12:01:55] <ul71m0> huh
[12:03:03] <ul71m0> how should i do that
[12:03:17] <robertmaxrees> it should just work.
[12:03:58] <frabblerock> yeah, i destroy the shuffle on click of the arrow, and still getting same result
[12:04:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to run the destroy pre-load.  if that doesn't work, you'll need to pull out your debugger and profile it.
[12:06:18] <frabblerock> got it
[12:06:22] <frabblerock> ran filter in ajaxStop
[12:06:26] <frabblerock> and it works perfectly.
[12:08:04] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[12:09:56] <ismarkup> guys, I have this in my URL grid.php?cat=20 is there a way to assign this to a variable to send it thru ajax? thanks
[12:14:43] <robertmaxrees> ismarkup window.location.path + window.location.search
[12:16:49] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: hey man, you still around?
[12:17:03] <shane1> hello, if you had to make a wizard style form that validated on each step what plugin would you use, i'm getting frustrated with jqueryvalidation.org
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser yep.
[12:18:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd use that particular plugin, shane1
[12:18:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'd roll my ownb.
[12:19:06] <shane1> i'm getting stuck with toms of custom validators and rules and it's becoming unmanageable real quick
[12:38:10] <_DB> hey guys having some trouble with how to approach adding a ajax request to this script
[12:38:11] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/u470p4er/
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:38:37] <_DB> inside of the Jquery(function($)
[12:38:51] <_DB> I want to add a ajax request to prevent it from going to another page
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> before you go any further, are you sure the other server will allow the ajax call?
[12:39:06] <_DB> but I dont know where to add it because I still need it to keep the behavior
[12:39:13] <_DB> yes
[12:39:17] <_DB> I've heard it does
[12:39:28] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so do you want the ajax to run when you submit that code?
[12:39:29] <_DB> I asked in the IRC room and one of the admins said I can
[12:39:33] <robertmaxrees> *submit that form.
[12:39:38] <_DB> yeah
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so put the ajax call in the submit.
[12:39:56] <_DB> I just need it to also do this         Stripe.card.createToken($form, stripeResponseHandler);
[12:39:56] <robertmaxrees> code's pretty straightforward.
[12:41:12] <_DB> would I put it under all that code?
[12:41:31] <robertmaxrees> does it rely on anything else running?
[12:41:37] <robertmaxrees> like... this is pretty straightforward.
[12:41:44] <_DB> whoops
[12:41:47] <_DB> give me a sec
[12:42:08] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/u470p4er/1/
[12:42:27] <_DB> before it submits a hidden element gets apened to it with a token
[12:42:39] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:42:48] <robertmaxrees> have you tried adding in the ajax call?
[12:43:10] <_DB> no Im not sure where to add it XD
[12:43:15] <_DB> -_-
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:43:22] <robertmaxrees> probably in the submit handler.
[12:43:28] <robertmaxrees> if that's when you want it to run.
[12:43:47] <_DB> yeah but would it go under this         Stripe.card.createToken($form, stripeResponseHandler);?
[12:43:58] <_DB> because there already code running when you submit it
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> dunno - would the ajax call rely on that information?
[12:44:05] <_DB> yeah
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> then what do you think?
[12:44:30] <PeterPorka> good evening, i have a problem with my jquery keydown: http://pastebin.com/Yf22TgDc ..everything works fine but when i change the site where the textinput does not exists i am getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'keydown' of null, how to prevent this?
[12:44:40] <_DB> so the only reason its going to another page now is because the lack of a ajac request?
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> _DB it's going to another page because you're re-submitting the form in the stripeResponseHandler.
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> step through it  it's pretty straightforward.
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> PeterPorka you can wrap that in an if ($('#txtInput').length) {}; check
[12:45:46] <_DB> alright thanks
[12:46:10] <robertmaxrees> _DB i'd read learn.jquery.com/events/ and then follow that up with http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[12:46:19] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[12:46:22] <_DB> lol
[12:46:48] <PeterPorka> robertmaxrees:i tried thoses but Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
[12:47:00] <PeterPorka> that was my first thought with length
[12:47:48] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: I believe my previous code (commented out) works very well, but only checks the first class of the element, could you please comment on my second attempt and how I can check each individual class? http://jsbin.com/vojigo/4/edit
[13:01:56] <PeterPorka> i wraped it in a funtion, now it works
[13:01:57] <PeterPorka> thx
[13:19:43] <basiclaser> wonder what he's having for lunch :v
[13:21:56] <person> If i have a $.post(...).done(...).fail(...).always(...); is ther any garauntee of the order that the done, fail and always functions will run? can i be sure that done or fail will complete before always is run?
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> person you should be able to, yes, assuming the .done() / .fail() aren't other async calls.
[13:26:44] <person> robertmaxrees: great, thanks!
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser so your code doesn't really make sense right now.
[13:29:02] <robertmaxrees> also why do you have three copies of jquery included?
[13:32:30] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: ha. Oh i didnt realise they stacked like that when clicked
[13:34:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to build you a kind of overblown solution for this that doesn't use regex because i want to be clever.
[13:34:41] <robertmaxrees> no guarantees about how great of an idea it is though.
[13:35:05] <basiclaser> gahaha...
[13:35:14] <robertmaxrees> so it should always be 'xs' right?
[13:36:31] <basiclaser> so i want to get all elements which have one or more classes containing 'col-', then for each element, get their particular 'col-'(s) and duplicate them but with xs instead robertmaxrees
[13:36:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9j6frgee/ there are cleaner ways to do this, and this makes some assumptions, but it should work otherwise.
[13:43:09] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: wow, just working my way through it :P
[13:44:34] <robertmaxrees> it's hacky, but meh.
[13:45:33] <basiclaser> its uhh yeh its great bro we'll call you
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:45:45] <basiclaser> no no we'll call you
[13:45:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:46:12] <GreatDanton> heya
[13:47:17] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: i just dont know who i am anymore. what was so wrong with my last attempt I showed you? :P
[13:47:57] <robertmaxrees> first off, if($('*[class^="col-"]')){ will always return "true"
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> because objects are truthy in js
[13:48:38] <jeffmjack> if your website's jquery to make an api call to a foreign URL via $.ajax, is that a cross-domain request?
[13:48:49] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack yess.
[13:49:19] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: oh ok, but you see what I was trying to do right? I guess i could borrow your if (className.indexOf('col-') > -1) and work it in
[13:49:41] <jeffmjack> and is this where CORS can get in the way of things?
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack yes.
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser you were basically headed in the same direction, just not thinking it all the way through
[13:52:03] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack but only if the remote url prevents it.
[13:52:34] <jeffmjack> ah I see
[13:53:09] <jeffmjack> browsers don't typically block that behavior right?  Otherwise CDN's wouldn't be a popular way to pull in resources, right?
[13:53:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:53:22] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[13:53:33] <jeffmjack> hm go on please
[13:53:34] <robertmaxrees> browsers follow whatever the server says.
[13:53:39] <jeffmjack> right
[13:53:55] <robertmaxrees> script tags, css files, etc are still cross-origin, but the server can allow those and still block other resources.
[13:54:18] <jeffmjack> right
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> so the browser follows whatever the server says.
[13:54:54] <jeffmjack> how would a target server (the database with an api being called) know or care anything about cross origin then?
[13:55:04] <robertmaxrees> how or why?
[13:55:15] <jeffmjack> both
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> the why is pretty simple.
[13:55:24] <jeffmjack> it's just getting an http request, right?
[13:55:26] <jeffmjack> of course that
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> let me explain :)
[13:55:34] <jeffmjack> 's going to come from some random user
[13:55:37] <jeffmjack> ok :)
[13:55:50] <robertmaxrees> let's assume for a moment that you're like most other users and leave yourself logged into gmail.
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> i could build a script that uses ajax to access gmail and scrape it, then send it to me.
[13:56:49] <jeffmjack> as the logged in user, or as a spy?
[13:56:50] <robertmaxrees> this is because your browser runs the ajax call, which in turn means that it'll log in with your credentials.
[13:57:24] <robertmaxrees> it would be as you, because the request would come from your browser.
[13:57:28] <jeffmjack> ok
[13:57:29] <robertmaxrees> we can all agree that's probably really bad, right?
[13:57:34] <jeffmjack> yes
[13:57:50] <jeffmjack> i see
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> so, google sees cross-domain requests (they look a little different than normal GET requests) and blocks those from happening to certain URLs, like gmail.
[13:58:03] <jeffmjack> you mean when I, as a logged-in user, visit robertmaxrees.com
[13:58:12] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:58:48] <jeffmjack> and by google you mean the gmail team, of course
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> in this case, yes.
[13:59:10] <jeffmjack> and the browser is the thing that is adding stuff to the request to prevent spoofing?
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> the server says it doesn't want to allow cross-domain attacks, and the browsers respect that request.
[13:59:51] <jeffmjack> got it
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[14:00:26] <jeffmjack> so, the reason I was asking the question is this:
[14:00:53] <jeffmjack> a guy wants me to extend his squarespace site to submit api requests and parse that info into the squarespace template
[14:01:18] <jeffmjack> which, I know nothing about squarespace templates etc. but want to figure out if I can even make the ajax request in the first place
[14:01:30] <jeffmjack> so I'm googling stuff about ajax and squarespace
[14:01:31] <robertmaxrees> there are two ways to do that.
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> if you can't do it via ajax on the client side, you could probably do via your own server.
[14:02:14] <jeffmjack> right
[14:02:43] <jeffmjack> and now I'm injecting code via my server into some template?
[14:02:51] <robertmaxrees> errr, no.
[14:02:56] <jeffmjack> ah ok
[14:02:57] <robertmaxrees> well, iu'm not sure.
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that sentece really means.
[14:03:16] <jeffmjack> hm ok
[14:03:34] <GreatDanton> robertmaxrees, can you give me a tip how to center an image with .animate. I want to hide an image and show it as soon as someone opens the page via animating it from left to right.
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> GreatDanton http://stackoverflow.com/a/13740001/923919
[14:05:08] <hcl2> i have a simple question i can't google for:  $('selector').function(  selector.data('attrib') )   do i need to use explicity each() to reference the matched selector node in this case?
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> hcl2 http://api.jquery.com/data/ read the docs :)
[14:06:20] <hcl2> robertmaxrees: how do i reference the result of the selector?  $(this) is the window
[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> hcl2 just use .data()
[14:06:37] <robertmaxrees> $('div').data();
[14:07:07] <hcl2> but i need to do $('selector').editable( item.data('saveurl') { options for jeditable } )
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> then you need .each()
[14:07:31] <robertmaxrees> $('div').each(function() {});
[14:07:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the current div that you're on.
[14:08:07] <hcl2> thanks, wasn't sure if there was some reference i was missing
[14:08:17] <robertmaxrees> .function() isn't a thing fwiw.
[14:11:46] <Lencl> I'm making a matching quiz. I'm trying to think how to send the selected answers to server
[14:12:26] <Lencl> For example, I want to send an something like this {"1"=>"C","2"=>"F"...}
[14:12:36] <Lencl> but if a user changes his answer, it has to update that
[14:16:02] <robertmaxrees> so “1” would be the question and “c” would be the answer?
[14:16:24] <robertmaxrees> oh they left.
[14:48:05] <limbera> I'm having trouble with selectors.
[14:48:10] <limbera> i have this snippet: current_fs = $(this).parent();
[14:48:18] <limbera> which is returning a fieldset of a form
[14:48:38] <limbera> but i want to be able to get all the text inputs in current_fs
[14:48:50] <limbera> i know i can do it like so if i have the field set id
[14:48:51] <limbera> $('fieldset#fieldset1 > input[type=text]').each
[14:49:00] <limbera> but i wan't to make it dynamic/generic
[14:49:05] <limbera> is there a way to combine the two approaches?
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> current_fs.find();
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> .find() takes any selector you wnat.
[14:49:46] <robertmaxrees> *want
[14:49:47] <limbera> something lilsomething like this
[14:49:48] <limbera> $(current_fs '> input[type=text]').each
[14:49:51] <limbera> ohhhh damn i am so silly
[14:49:52] <limbera> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:49:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:50:02] <robertmaxrees> there’s also a .children()
[14:50:30] <limbera> perfect thank you
[14:50:44] <limbera> yeah i knew about find... just didn't have the experience to glue it all together
[14:51:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:53:13] <limbera> the reason i asked is because I'm trying to validate form input
[14:53:28] <limbera> my form uses field sets that are layered onto of each other
[14:53:41] <limbera> and the next field set is shown when the next button is pushed
[14:53:46] <limbera> because the forms are quite long
[14:53:56] <limbera> now I'm trying to validate the input at each step
[14:54:08] <limbera> like so: http://dpaste.com/0EZX1NA
[14:54:18] <limbera> but apparently value.val() is undefined
[14:54:37] <robertmaxrees> $(value).val() isn’t.
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> value is the DOM node, not the jquery object.
[14:55:01] <limbera> makes sense
[14:55:04] <robertmaxrees> you could also just use $(this) and dic the index and value args from that function.
[14:55:29] <limbera> i use index later though
[14:55:33] <limbera> is there a shorthand to getting index
[14:55:37] <limbera> $(this).index
[14:55:38] <limbera> perhaps
[14:55:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:55:44] <limbera> yeah ok cool
[14:55:49] <limbera> thanks robertmaxrees v helpful
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> well, there’s an .index(), but use what’s in .each() if you can.
[14:56:14] <limbera> yep
[15:01:26] <GreatDanton> I still can't get it to work
[15:01:37] <robertmaxrees> get what to work?
[15:01:46] <GreatDanton> it's long story I will type it
[15:01:52] <robertmaxrees> errrr/
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> just share code.
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> no stories :)
[15:02:02] <GreatDanton> it's too long
[15:02:03] <GreatDanton> xD
[15:02:16] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:02:51] <GreatDanton> my img is responsive via bootstrap responsive class, i want to animate it from left to right (it's not visible when you open the page then it's slowly getting towards center)
[15:02:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:03:26] <GreatDanton> i can't use css left: "x"px
[15:03:38] <GreatDanton> since i dont know how much pixels the image is
[15:03:45] <limbera> i'm using this: current_fs.find('input[type=text]').each() to get each input field in a fieldset
[15:03:46] <robertmaxrees> right, so you’ll have to calculate it.
[15:03:58] <limbera> i'm checking the contents with $(this).val()
[15:04:12] <limbera> and then if they don't meet some validation criteria that i have built i want to set the input fields border to be red
[15:04:21] <limbera> like so: $(this).addClass('invalid-input');
[15:04:46] <limbera> here's the full snippet: http://dpaste.com/0M7Y0A0
[15:05:05] <limbera> line 9 does not add the class to the dom element though
[15:05:27] <robertmaxrees> limbera make a simplified fiddle.
[15:06:06] <limbera> sure thing
[15:06:19] <limbera> it looks like it should work though right?
[15:06:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:08:39] <limbera> http://jsfiddle.net/256oy98a/
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you running?
[15:12:53] <limbera> 1.11.2
[15:13:38] <robertmaxrees> it’s getting the class.
[15:15:08] <limbera> really?
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> inspect it.
[15:15:21] <limbera> i have done
[15:15:22] <limbera> hmmm
[15:16:23] <limbera> ahh inspecting it
[15:16:25] <limbera> it appears
[15:16:28] <limbera> but viewing the source it doesn't
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> page source never updates.
[15:16:41] <limbera> probably makes sense given it's dynamically moding the src
[15:16:43] <limbera> gotcha
[15:16:45] <limbera> yeah
[15:16:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:16:59] <limbera> ok so i guess i need to work out my my CSS isn't working:P
[15:17:00] <limbera> thanks again robertmaxrees
[15:17:03] <limbera> where are you located?
[15:17:09] <robertmaxrees> northern california.
[15:17:27] <limbera> a quick jacky !important did the job :P
[15:17:33] <limbera> normal is beautiful
[15:17:36] <limbera> *norcal
[15:17:44] <robertmaxrees> depends on where you’re talking about ;)
[15:17:50] <limbera> hehe
[15:18:01] <limbera> i suppose
[15:18:11] <robertmaxrees> what part are you thinking of?
[15:18:32] <limbera> yosemite / tahoe
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> ah, no.
[15:18:43] <limbera> does big sur count as normal?
[15:18:54] <limbera> or is that more central
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> that’s more sourthern really.  depends on who you ask.
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> SF/the bay likes to think they’re norcal.
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> big sur is more southern.  i way north of all of that.
[15:19:41] <limbera> gotcha
[15:19:44] <limbera> i'm from australia
[15:19:49] <limbera> so way south of all of that
[15:19:49] <robertmaxrees> aaaah very nice. what area?
[15:19:54] <limbera> melbourne
[15:20:24] <robertmaxrees> always wanted to visit.
[15:21:08] <doug16k> http://www.jstraight.com/1219/5  <-- if you scroll down and mouse over some colors, the background doesnt change properly  fullscreen: http://www.jstraight.com/1219/5/show
[15:21:19] <doug16k> only in chrome though, can anyone confirm it?
[15:21:51] <robertmaxrees> doug16k i don’t get anything.
[15:22:18] <doug16k> anything?
[15:22:25] <doug16k> what, it's blank?
[15:22:28] <robertmaxrees> oh i have to manuyally click run?
[15:22:33] <doug16k> yes
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[15:22:38] <doug16k> just in case of infinite loop
[15:22:51] <robertmaxrees> so used to jsfiddle/jsbin
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah that’s broken for me.
[15:25:13] <doug16k> thanks for checking. it has terrible performance in firefox too. 4096 divs and it's bogged down pretty bad
[15:25:21] <doug16k> Im not flowing the document very efficiently though
[15:25:27] <limbera> is doing something like this $(".next").click()
[15:25:36] <limbera> only allowing a single click?
[15:25:43] <robertmaxrees> limbera nope.
[15:25:48] <robertmaxrees> that’ll do every click on a thing.
[15:25:57] <limbera> unless it somehow gets disabled somehere/
[15:25:59] <limbera> *somewhere?
[15:26:21] <limbera> i have that class being added and the border of the input field becomes red, but now i want to allow it to continue to the next field set upon invalid fields being fixed
[15:26:24] <doug16k> limbera, it makes the program click ALL the buttons with class next
[15:26:50] <robertmaxrees> they’re referring to the binding version i think.
[15:26:54] <robertmaxrees> not the triggering one.
[15:26:55] <limbera> but i've even put a print statement inside of the callback for click that is not printing
[15:27:00] <limbera> yeah binding not triggering
[15:27:21] <doug16k> limbera, for only allowing single click, use .one('click', ...
[15:27:28] <robertmaxrees> don’t do that though.
[15:27:30] <doug16k> like .on
[15:27:45] <limbera> http://dpaste.com/1WRGDBH
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> check to see if the current set is valid and only allow the user to continue if so.
[15:28:11] <limbera> robertmaxrees: "don't do that though"
[15:28:15] <GreatDanton> robertmaxrees, if you want to look when you have time; http://jsfiddle.net/ung7L1t5/4/
[15:28:16] <limbera> as in don't use the binding click?
[15:28:16] <robertmaxrees> $(".next").click(function(e){
[15:28:29] <robertmaxrees> then e.preventDefault(); if it’s invalid.
[15:28:29] <doug16k> yeah dont use it unless you really really only want that click callback to happen once
[15:28:39] <limbera> gotcha
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> GreatDanton i linked you to an article earlier explaining how to do this.
[15:29:32] <GreatDanton> i saw it but it's not working
[15:29:37] <limbera> i still don't understand why clicking ".next"
[15:29:42] <GreatDanton> what to write in css?
[15:29:42] <limbera> with .click
[15:29:45] <limbera> is only being executed once
[15:29:58] <robertmaxrees> limbera do the new “next” buttons exist on pageload?
[15:30:02] <robertmaxrees> or do you add them after the fact?
[15:30:08] <limbera> they exist
[15:30:12] <limbera> on page load
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> and they’re not getting destroyed/recreated at any point?
[15:30:23] <limbera> the flow of events is i click next, and the form is invalid
[15:30:28] <limbera> so it correctly triggers adding the classes
[15:30:37] <limbera> to the inputs to indicate they are invlid (red border)
[15:30:46] <limbera> then i rectify the invalid inputs and click next
[15:30:48] <limbera> but nothing happens
[15:31:03] <limbera> the validation doesn't occur again
[15:31:14] <limbera> and neither does a console log test i put in
[15:31:19] <limbera> in here: http://dpaste.com/1WRGDBH
[15:31:49] <robertmaxrees> GreatDanton start by getting this part right: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ung7L1t5/5/
[15:32:16] <limbera> oh gosh i found it
[15:32:22] <limbera> rogue "return false" in my code
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> that’ll do it.
[15:33:42] <limbera> yay it works. thanks guys
[15:38:43] <NBhosting> anyone know jplayer? im getting this error https://dpaste.de/R0W7
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> NBhosting that means you’re not loading jplay before trying to use it.
[15:39:28] <NBhosting> got my js files in the head
[15:39:42] <robertmaxrees> the order should be jquery, jplayer, then your code.
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you’re not loading jquery more than once.
[15:40:04] <NBhosting> got that
[15:41:10] <NBhosting> source code of page https://dpaste.de/xNfu/raw
[15:41:51] <NBhosting> example page http://djmixing.nl/stream/2/fm4.html.html
[15:42:01] <robertmaxrees> NBhosting you have jquery included twice on that page.
[15:42:11] <NBhosting> mm do i
[15:42:16] <robertmaxrees> <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
[15:42:21] <NBhosting> ah at the bottom
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> and <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[15:42:25] <robertmaxrees> kill one.
[15:42:26] <NBhosting> let me remove that
[15:43:21] <NBhosting> thanks
[15:46:44] <NBhosting> mm doesnt seem to like the shoutcast url P
[15:46:59] <robertmaxrees> that url is really strange.
[15:47:17] <NBhosting> http://yp.shoutcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.m3u?id=idofstation
[15:47:26] <robertmaxrees> and the content-type isn’t supported it looks like.
[15:47:33] <NBhosting> m3u/pls or xspf
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> i meant of http://djmixing.nl/stream/2/fm4.html - you have .html on the end twice.
[15:47:54] <NBhosting> ah yeah mistake in my naming, will fix it
[15:52:27] <stylica> Does jquery addClass add the same class multiple times when being invoked multiple with the same class name?
[15:52:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:52:42] <robertmaxrees> prevents that from happening.
[15:53:07] <NBhosting> seems i have to parse the shoutcast file to get the ip:port
[15:53:14] <NBhosting> jplayer cant handle pls
[15:53:20] <limbera> if i have a numerical input value
[15:53:33] <limbera> and the user doesn't submit anything
[15:53:39] <limbera> is the .val() of that input empty string?
[15:53:40] <limbera> or null?
[15:54:31] <stylica> thanks!
[16:07:19] <stylica> So can jquery, after adding a class, know when the css3 animation completed and then invoke hide().
[16:07:21] <stylica> ?
[16:36:27] <frabblerock> is there anyway to preload jquery .load
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> sorta.
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> look into ajax and caching.
[16:39:57] <doug16k> frabblerock,  you should .load into a document fragment
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.
[16:40:18] <robertmaxrees> though now the question is why use ajax at all.
[16:40:18] <frabblerock> what does he mean by that
[16:40:35] <jeffmjack> anything wrong in these two lines of code?  the second line isn't doing hwat it's supposed to
[16:40:36] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/7wwtm52m/1/
[16:40:39] <doug16k> frabblerock, let me make a demo
[16:41:03] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack that should work fine.
[16:41:10] <jeffmjack> ok thanks :/
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> why would you ajax in that content just to proload it in?
[16:41:29] <stylica> Can I use jquery addClass or toggleClass to force jquery to wait until a css transition is completed and then run a callback?
[16:41:46] <stylica> Or do I have to couple the overall transition time with the js code?
[16:42:29] <frabblerock> jeffmjack what are you trying to do
[16:42:48] <jeffmjack> delete a section based on class
[16:42:56] <jeffmjack> given that I have the article as a jquery obj
[16:43:00] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack make sure you’re traversing correctly.
[16:43:10] <jeffmjack> and the section is nested in the article
[16:43:19] <robertmaxrees> .closest() can grab the current element if you’re not careful.
[16:43:50] <jeffmjack> hm, the click event is happening in a section
[16:44:03] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle to make it functional.
[16:44:10] <jeffmjack> yeah.. ok
[16:48:06] <doug16k> frabblerock, http://jsfiddle.net/eqev9q6g/
[16:49:03] <doug16k> or, to make it work no matter when it runs: http://jsfiddle.net/eqev9q6g/1/
[16:49:39] <doug16k> or http://jsfiddle.net/eqev9q6g/2/
[16:49:42] <frabblerock> thanks for this
[16:50:17] <doug16k> if you know it will only be placed in one place, you can omit the .clone()
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> i don’t understand why you need to do this...
[16:50:44] <robertmaxrees> your broiwser showuld cache it.
[16:50:59] <doug16k> reduces latency though, 1st time
[16:51:08] <robertmaxrees> eh maybe?
[16:51:13] <doug16k> assuming you start the .load before document ready
[16:51:49] <doug16k> frabblerock, you want this for performance right? what is the reason?
[16:51:57] <frabblerock> well
[16:51:58] <frabblerock> go here
[16:52:16] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[16:52:19] <frabblerock> click the next arrow
[16:52:30] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/7wwtm52m/6/
[16:52:37] <frabblerock> id like to not have to reload all of the content like that
[16:52:40] <frabblerock> and not wait so long
[16:52:52] <frabblerock> but events change
[16:52:57] <frabblerock> categories change
[16:53:02] <frabblerock> category counts change
[16:53:04] <frabblerock> dates change
[16:53:15] <jeffmjack> just realized the class is not in the html
[16:53:22] <jeffmjack> that could be the bug..
[16:54:33] <frabblerock> hence why im reloading all content
[16:54:41] <frabblerock> or emptying everything then loading it back in
[16:55:08] <jeffmjack> yup, that was it
[16:55:26] <robertmaxrees> this feels like premature optimization.
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock there are lots of ways to do what you want, sure, but it feels like you’re solving a problem you might not yet have.
[16:56:03] <Robdgreat> "if I solve it now I won't ever have it"
[16:56:05] <Robdgreat> -too many people
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> i’d give people a datepicker, instead of making them click through each date in sequence, but otherwise that shouldn’t be much of a problem.
[16:56:32] <frabblerock> they will have a datepicker
[16:56:38] <frabblerock> but it will have the same effect
[16:56:41] <robertmaxrees> then don’t worry about this until it becomes a problem.
[16:56:46] <frabblerock> they will have the option to click a date
[16:56:49] <frabblerock> and do the same
[16:56:54] <frabblerock> or choose a date range
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> you’re basically solving a problem you don’t yet really have.
[16:57:19] <frabblerock> i just hate that im removing everything from the page
[16:57:48] <frabblerock> would it be considered 4 different ajax calls if i load in content for each individual section instead of emptying the main wrapper
[16:57:52] <frabblerock> ?
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> this is why premature optimization is bad.
[16:58:20] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to make this super efficient, make an api that exposes JSON for the events and use some client-side templating to build out what you need.
[16:58:32] <frabblerock> i was using handlebars at first
[16:58:47] <frabblerock> but was then forced to use php for initial page laod
[16:58:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, stop worrying about this particular problem.
[16:58:51] <frabblerock> and changing dates
[16:59:05] <frabblerock> hence why im using ajax
[16:59:17] <doug16k> frabblerock, if you end up using my code, you can maximize 1st display performance by starting the loads in <head> asap after loading jquery
[16:59:39] <doug16k> that causes you to have to load jquery in head though so ymmv, try it and see
[16:59:54] <bl4ckdu5t> A help with this please http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/myLbNw . Trying to fix content on scroll but not working
[17:00:26] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t bad event binding.
[17:00:56] <bl4ckdu5t> how? explain please
[17:01:00] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t you need to use a string, not a jquery object, for that second arg.
[17:01:13] <robertmaxrees> .on(‘scroll’, ‘#wrap’, function() {});
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> but that’s not really what you want either.
[17:01:44] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees i just wanted to say youve been really helpful to myself and everyone else on here the past few days, probably more - but I just wanted to say it's appreciated.
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah fsho - it’s what we do.
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t are you trying to fix the wrap object to the top of the page?
[17:02:42] <doug16k> frabblerock, in a modern browser it would use a keep-alive connection and should stream the requests, so the cost is lower than it looks
[17:03:00] <bl4ckdu5t> no I'm trying to giv ve it a fixed class
[17:03:05] <frabblerock> doug16k, what you wrote you're referring to?
[17:03:10] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t when what happens?
[17:03:11] <doug16k> the php side will probably be doing expensive things though
[17:03:13] <bl4ckdu5t> when the class is fixed, the search input sticks to top of page
[17:03:24] <doug16k> frabblerock, referring to your question about how bad is 4 separate requests
[17:03:30] <bl4ckdu5t> when scrolled to 170px from the top
[17:03:36] <frabblerock> oh alright
[17:03:39] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t when the window is?
[17:03:57] <frabblerock> thanks doug16k
[17:04:03] <bl4ckdu5t> scrolled 170px downward
[17:04:15] <frabblerock> when i get this launched, i'm going to refactor some code and see how i can speed this up.
[17:04:16] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t then you want $(window).on(‘scroll’, function() {});
[17:04:36] <frabblerock> i guess my concern is i've never written anything alone that may get thousands of hit a day
[17:04:43] <robertmaxrees> and to not use $(this), bl4ckdu5t
[17:04:49] <frabblerock> if a thousand people a day are doing these ajax request
[17:04:54] <frabblerock> im worried about speed
[17:05:11] <doug16k> frabblerock, if you get tons of hits, make sure you get your caching right, and make sure your content is actually possible to cache (meaning, isn't different every time)
[17:05:32] <frabblerock> the content is though, images, text, etc.
[17:05:43] <frabblerock> it is going to be different on each request.
[17:06:09] <bl4ckdu5t> robertmaxrees: this instead?
[17:06:14] <doug16k> frabblerock, the same url will return different thing every time?
[17:06:43] <frabblerock> its not the same url, it's a url passing params for start date and end date - that url returns different events every time
[17:07:01] <doug16k> frabblerock, I find that hard to believe
[17:07:11] <frabblerock> why?
[17:07:17] <frabblerock> click the next arrow
[17:07:21] <frabblerock> look at the events
[17:07:25] <frabblerock> look at the urls
[17:07:36] <doug16k> frabblerock, you use GET requests right?
[17:07:42] <frabblerock> yes
[17:07:48] <bl4ckdu5t> I meant should I use this instead of $(this)
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t no because that’d be the window object.
[17:08:43] <doug16k> then once you get /foo.php?start=12345000&end=12355000   then it can cache that exact request
[17:08:44] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i leave.
[17:08:45] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[17:09:02] <bl4ckdu5t> Then how do I get it to do what I want at 170px?
[17:09:10] <bl4ckdu5t> oops!
[17:10:03] <frabblerock> thanks again Robdgreat
[17:10:05] <frabblerock> lol
[17:10:14] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees
[17:10:15] <doug16k> frabblerock, there are more ways to cache than expiry dates
[17:10:46] <doug16k> with etags it can change at any moment, and always get latest data, AND use the cache when it didnt change
[17:12:56] <doug16k> I mentioned not making every request be different because that is what ends up happening in php if you dont go out of your way to avoid sticking in some unique stuff somewhere that makes it impossible to cache

[21:55:59] <Guddu> vishaldeep, Thanks. I have not. I will do that right away. Still learning. Thanks a ton again.
[21:56:27] <Kamuela> Can anyone help me figure out why line 14 isn't behaving as expected here? http://jsfiddle.net/aza4n4o1/3/
[21:56:31] <vishaldeep> no problem
[21:57:37] <Kamuela> Hmm... replace with worked
[21:57:43] <Kamuela> very weird, don't understand why
[21:59:23] <vishaldeep> Kampala, because in focus out, input box becomes the target
[21:59:45] <vishaldeep> so you are basically inserting the given html in input box, which is not possible
[22:00:11] <Guddu> vishaldeep, I included jquery-ui.min.js but the problem persists.
[22:00:12] <vishaldeep> just use $(target).parent()...
[22:00:49] <vishaldeep> just use $(target).parent().html(....)
[22:02:23] <vishaldeep> Kamuela
[22:02:39] <vishaldeep> did it work for you?
[22:02:40] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/hPMEG/58/
[22:02:52] <caper> why it's not show the child value
[22:03:00] <caper> it's just show the 1
[22:03:08] <vishaldeep> Guddu you'll need to include jquery-ui just after you include query
[22:03:16] <Kamuela> vishaldeep: this version did http://jsfiddle.net/aza4n4o1/6/
[22:03:24] <Guddu> Oh ok
[22:03:30] <Kamuela> I don't understand why replaceWith() needed to be used instead of html() just for that one thing...
[22:03:43] <Guddu> Thanks vishaldeep  :-) it works now.
[22:04:10] <vishaldeep> Kampala because you are replacing the input box with paragraph, which will insert paragraph in paragraph
[22:04:22] <vishaldeep> f*@#$ing autocorrect
[22:04:32] <vishaldeep> doesn't let me write your name :P
[22:05:09] <vishaldeep> Kamuela you can check in dev tools, the replace with is inserting a new paragraph inside the existing paragraph
[22:06:17] <Kamuela> vishaldeep: what would be the preferred way of full replacement in both instances?
[22:07:10] <vishaldeep> you may want to use $(target).parent()
[22:07:12] <vishaldeep> in both cases
[22:07:25] <vishaldeep> after this you can either use replaceWith() or html()
[22:08:53] <Guddu> When i do a form submit using jquery $('#table_management_form').submit(); it is not POSTing but doing a GET. What could be the issue? The same thing does a POST if i include method="post" in the form HTML. But in another project my form does not has this explicit method="post"  thing. What could be the reason? Isn't the form supposed to be submitted using POST?
[22:09:27] <vishaldeep> Guddu have you sent method="post" on your form?
[22:10:06] <Guddu> vishaldeep, Is it absolutely necessary to do so? Because in other projects i did not explicitly mention the method and it stilll posted.
[22:10:41] <vishaldeep> by default form uses GET to submit, you'll have to explicitly set it to method="post" to use POST
[22:10:51] <Kamuela> vishaldeep: seems to break it on jsfiddle when i use .parent() with any configuration. parent() for the first click replaces what's probably <body> in jsfiddle and the second breaks further clicks
[22:12:35] <vishaldeep> Kamuela: try https://jsfiddle.net/aza4n4o1/3/
[22:14:20] <Kamuela> vishaldeep: doesn't work for me on focusout
[22:15:46] <caper> hey how can i push the json in children of anothere json
[22:15:52] <caper> 	http://jsfiddle.net/hPMEG/58/
[22:15:59] <vishaldeep> caper: you are logging the output of push function, which will be 1
[22:16:23] <vishaldeep> if you log devicejson.children on the next line, you'll see the inserted values
[22:16:43] <caper> That's the problem in my json i will push the whole json in children
[22:16:52] <Narhir> hi guys
[22:17:24] <vishaldeep> caper your code is working fine, it was just the console.log statement
[22:17:29] <Narhir> how did they created the top menu animation ?
[22:17:48] <Narhir> http://urbaninfluence.com/ I managed to do the on scroll change background color.. but without any animations -.- and the animation is the key here
[22:18:07] <vishaldeep> Kamuela: I'm checking on chrome and it seems to be working fine
[22:18:12] <vishaldeep> did you check the link I sent?
[22:18:22] <vishaldeep> I'm using this: $(target).parent().html('<p class="editable">' + formValue + '</p>');
[22:18:43] <vishaldeep> replace with will replace the object, which might remove the event as well
[22:19:12] <caper> vishaldeep no i can't see any value
[22:19:20] <caper> children i blank
[22:19:41] <Chulbul> Im getting this error, TypeError: jQuery(...).toggles is not a function ... using jquery-1.11.1.min.js
[22:20:05] <vishaldeep> Kamuela: try this now https://jsfiddle.net/aza4n4o1/3/
[22:21:36] <Kamuela> Chulbul: .toggle() is not .toggles()
[22:21:44] <vishaldeep> caper: https://jsfiddle.net/hPMEG/58/
[22:21:55] <vishaldeep> the second log statement is logging the userJson object
[22:22:04] <vishaldeep> which also has "children": []
[22:22:17] <vishaldeep> is that the confusion?
[22:22:58] <caper> hey vishaldeep actually when i push the whole json it's create 0 then it's show the value wait i send you the fiddle
[22:23:28] <Chulbul> Kamuela, but I purchased one theme, and that theme its working fine, when I implemented it , its showing me error
[22:23:44] <caper> vishal deep see this  http://jsfiddle.net/hPMEG/59/
[22:23:46] <vishaldeep> Kampala, sorry that was wrong link. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/aza4n4o1/7/
[22:25:08] <vishaldeep> caper because it's an array and it was empty. when you used push() it pushed the userJson to 0th index of children[] array
[22:25:43] <caper> ok if i write children{} then i cannot push
[22:26:22] <vishaldeep> if you need to replace the children, then you can simply assign it like this:
[22:26:22] <vishaldeep> devicejson.children = userJson
[22:27:14] <vishaldeep> Kamuela did the new link work for you?
[22:28:06] <caper> vishaldeep great it's work veer
[22:29:02] <vishaldeep> caper please note that using that code your children array in devicejson is not an array anymore, so you won't be able to push() anything
[22:29:46] <vishaldeep> if you want to keep it as an array, then use the previous code, but use devicejson.children[0] to log the contents
[22:30:02] <iamjimmy> hi, I am trying to find element of the class using .find method.But it shows [] on console when I do $(document).find("0"), when <b class="0">0</b> is present in the document
[22:30:03] <caper> but i have to chained the elemnt
[22:30:10] <iamjimmy> what do you think might be the reason
[22:30:53] <vishaldeep> try find(".0")
[22:31:43] <vishaldeep> caper you can chain from children[0] as well
[22:32:03] <caper> vishaldeep no it's wrong
[22:32:52] <caper> vishaldeep  any other idea how can i chained the elemnt
[22:33:05] <vishaldeep> caper http://jsfiddle.net/hPMEG/61/
[22:34:19] <vishaldeep> iamjimmy did you try find(".0")?
[22:34:46] <caper> vishaldeep  no it's wromg dude
[22:34:46] <iamjimmy> vishaldeep:thanks bro, worked for me
[22:35:49] <vishaldeep> caper you should probably use a for/foreach loop to loop over the children
[22:36:25] <vishaldeep> or you can just replace children array with userJson object as I mentioned earlier
[22:39:26] <Kamuela> vishaldeep: yeah it does :)
[22:41:04] <neruda> hi im appending a new tab and content to a form, i can *see* the new tab and fields but they are not present when I click "view source"...rails app using bootstrap and simple form, ideas?

[23:06:14] <dobidobz> Hi everyone! Do you know any good Image Resizers? Was using before PHP based resizer (timthumb) but this is no longer supported due to vulnerability
[23:46:33] <iamjimmy> I am assigning value 0 to variable by using  x=0, but when I alert it the value is shown as 6
[23:46:48] <Cork> ?code @ iamjimmy
[23:46:48] <b-ot> iamjimmy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:47:55] <iamjimmy> Cork:   http://jsfiddle.net/kmLm80h3/
[23:48:23] <Cork> iamjimmy: ajax is async
[23:49:22] <Cork> so ya, the flow is x = 0; for loop requesting ajax requests (including x++)
[23:49:32] <Cork> (later) checking current x value == 6
[23:49:57] <iamjimmy> but for t it is working fine
[23:50:06] <Cork> iamjimmy: use console.log() and put it just before x++
[23:50:13] <Cork> alert is not a good tool for debugging
[23:50:36] <Cork> ya cause you aren't using it in the callback
[23:50:42] <Cork> so it runs sync
[23:51:01] <Cork> also "{id:'" + t + "'}" => JSON.stringify({ id: t })
[23:51:43] <Cork> also, you still have basically only global variables
[23:51:56] <Cork> you really need to define them (commented on this last time too)
[23:52:17] <Cork> same about alert being a BAD debug tool
[23:52:53] <iamjimmy> Cork: oh yeah, sorry, I remember you commenting on it last time.Console showing 0,5 values but how to I put em in ajax request
[23:53:17] <Cork> iamjimmy: you would have to wrap the ajax call in a scope
[23:53:28] <Cork> so you can create an unique variable for each itteration
[23:53:37] <Cork> but that is only possible if you stop using global variables
[23:54:34] <iamjimmy> Cork: alright, but I don't know how to wrap it so I can get it in same scope
[23:54:47] <Cork> iamjimmy: (function() {})()
[23:55:03] <Cork> but again, that wrapper won't change anything unless you fix the variables
