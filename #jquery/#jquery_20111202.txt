[00:00:52] <dida> hi all, just browse validation plugin. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/valid
[00:01:10] <mansoor-s> Is there a way to get the browser to stop showing where an anchor tag's href leads to? I'm writing an app and it just ruins the whole experience and makes it look ugly
[00:01:27] <dida> the valid() description says it checks whether selected elements are valid
[00:02:14] <dida> but it doesn't have an example. Is it possible to check only some of the required elements?
[00:05:29] <Cork> mansoor-s: no, its a "say in control" feature
[00:05:48] <Cork> mansoor-s: only way is to not use a tags and use something like span or button instead
[00:06:15] <mansoor-s> Cort, yah I just might do that   thanks!
[00:06:25] <Cork> and if you use href="#" or href="void(0)" or href="javascript:" thats what you should have done to start with
[00:06:51] <crab> say in control?
[00:06:58] <Cork> *stay
[00:07:02] <crab> oh
[00:07:14] <Cork> mansoor-s: but if its real links you should really reconsider leaving them, its bad practis to hide the url info
[00:07:48] <mansoor-s> Cork, no not real links, just interaction with the application
[00:09:20] <qawsedrf> is there a pure JS/jquery copy to clipboard plugin ?
[00:09:35] <Cork> can't be
[00:09:44] <Cork> js isn't allowed to access the clipboard
[00:09:53] <Cork> cross browser that is
[00:10:45] <Cork> qawsedrf: only way i know of that works is the copy flash plugin
[00:10:56] <Cork> it sucks big time but...
[00:11:35] <Zogot> Ahoy
[00:28:14] <fatmandown> Can anyone recommend to me a good resource with which to learn jQuery? Sorry if this is a bit off-topic.
[00:28:36] <alex88> hi guys, i'm going to create a pagination system in ajax, so when i click on 2nd page for example it retreive with ajax the json of the elments he want to display, what's the best way to create the list of elements without putting all the html within the js function, maybe using some kind of "model" and replace placeholders...
[00:31:18] <jrockjiggz> hello
[00:31:42] <jrockjiggz> how would i go about passing the jquery var into a function that is outside of jquery ready()?
[00:32:13] <jrockjiggz> i was thinking:   jQuery( function($){ ... });  and this works.. but how would i do a named function?
[00:32:26] <Jeroenem> hi, im struggling with a problem. I've got a <img tag with a pic="true" attribute. But i want to convert it to a <li> item with an anchor and img tag - like: http://jsfiddle.net/xgvQw/ how can this be done with jQuery?
[00:32:34] <jrockjiggz> and how do i call that named function? do i include the jQuery var as one of the function params?
[00:32:41] <jrockjiggz> see example: http://jsfiddle.net/zVEwg/
[00:38:56] <qawsedrf> sad
[00:40:44] <alex88> like an alternative of jquery templating which is not developed anymore
[00:41:19] <SugaSlide> doT
[00:41:27] <SugaSlide> seems really cool..
[00:41:41] <SugaSlide> cant use it in my project.. so busy with jqote2
[00:48:34] <Jeroenem> Got a img tag with a pic="true" attribute i want to convert it to a list item with an anchor and img tag - like: http://jsfiddle.net/xgvQw/ how can this be done with jQuery?
[00:49:56] <Jeroenem> i tried prepend.. but this doesnt do the job as supposed
[00:55:49] <SugaSlide> Jeroenem http://jsfiddle.net/xgvQw/3/
[00:58:59] <SugaSlide> Jeroenem http://jsfiddle.net/xgvQw/4/
[00:58:59] <Jeroenem> SugaSlide wow :) that makes a lot of sense
[00:59:40] <SugaSlide> otherwise you could create a "template"
[00:59:57] <SugaSlide> and then loop through all the images.. and replace them with the template
[01:00:03] <Jeroenem> mmh
[01:00:38] <Jeroenem> is there any documentation about those "templates"?
[01:02:58] <SugaSlide> Jeroenem im gonna get flamed for this.. http://jsfiddle.net/xgvQw/5/
[01:03:23] <SugaSlide> and it wont "work" like that.. but should give you the picture
[01:03:32] <aaronmcadam> ?g mustache templates @ Jeroenem
[01:03:48] <aaronmcadam> where are you bot-t
[01:03:57] <SugaSlide> if you need templating elsewhere aswell :P
[01:04:02] <Jeroenem> kk SudoKing thanks, i will get into it
[01:04:07] <Jeroenem> SugaSlide*
[01:04:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:04:40] <aaronmcadam> for a simple replace maybe
[01:04:45] <SugaSlide> at the mo the fastest templating system is https://github.com/olado/doT
[01:04:49] <aaronmcadam> not inside an each, you should use a templater
[01:05:15] <SugaSlide> yeah
[01:05:18] <aaronmcadam> I think support is more important
[01:05:26] <aaronmcadam> actually
[01:05:33] <aaronmcadam> handlebars is becoming standard
[01:05:49] <aaronmcadam> seeing it everywhere
[01:06:08] <aaronmcadam> Jeroenem: http://www.handlebarsjs.com/
[01:06:20] <SugaSlide> yeah seen it around aswell
[01:06:24] <SugaSlide> but yeah..
[01:06:33] <aaronmcadam> I use underscore's cuz i'm using backbone
[01:06:52] <SugaSlide> im using jqote2
[01:07:03] <SugaSlide> cause i cant use {{ }} in my js template :P
[01:07:05] <aaronmcadam> what's that
[01:07:13] <Jeroenem> thanks aaronmcadam
[01:07:18] <aaronmcadam> underscore uses erb style
[01:07:27] <SugaSlide> and im too lazy to edit the other systems
[01:07:29] <aaronmcadam> tho it's easy to change to {{ or whatever u wat
[01:07:33] <juha_> http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif
[01:07:36] <SugaSlide> yeah regex
[01:08:00] <SugaSlide> ROFL
[01:09:00] <anli_> Is there a jquery way of setting visibility to hidden?
[01:09:09] <SugaSlide> .hide()
[01:09:13] <SugaSlide> o wait..
[01:09:18] <aaronmcadam> that sets display
[01:09:21] <SugaSlide> .css("visibility")
[01:09:23] <aaronmcadam> not visibility
[01:09:26] <aaronmcadam> bingo
[01:09:27] <SugaSlide> yeah
[01:09:36] <SugaSlide> hence the o wait :P
[01:09:39] <SugaSlide> lols
[01:09:40] <aaronmcadam> aye
[01:09:41] <SugaSlide> <3
[01:10:14] <aaronmcadam> <3 u too :)
[01:10:16] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[01:10:28] <aaronmcadam> gimme some Suga :D
[01:10:51] * SugaSlide gives aaronmcadam some suga
[01:10:56] <SugaSlide> :D
[01:10:59] <aaronmcadam> yum!
[01:11:13] <aaronmcadam> ok, too much suga now
[01:11:22] * aaronmcadam runs round in circles
[01:29:28] <jrockjiggz> hey would anyone know how i can do this? http://jsfiddle.net/zVEwg/
[01:30:34] <wknowles>  $('#id').doSomething('sleep','coffee');  ----- I thinks
[01:30:38] <jrockjiggz> oops http://jsfiddle.net/zVEwg/2/
[01:30:48] <risky> hi,
[01:30:59] <jrockjiggz> so, do i pass $ as the first param of function?
[01:31:08] <Kingsy> using a jquery selector how do you grab the <head>? is it literally just $('head')?
[01:31:19] <risky> how do i make window scroll to div after the div appears????
[01:31:21] <jrockjiggz> Kingsy: yes should be
[01:31:32] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: ah, sorry
[01:31:35] <jrockjiggz> risky: scrollTo('div')
[01:31:53] <risky> tried it but it aint working
[01:32:46] <jrockjiggz> risky: actually u need a plugin http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[01:33:03] <risky> yer I have included that
[01:33:43] <jrockjiggz> $(window)._scrollable();
[01:33:48] <jrockjiggz> include that
[01:34:04] <risky> in the jquery click?
[01:34:06] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: hmm no that doesnt seem to grab anything, just am empty object
[01:35:01] <jrockjiggz> what do you need in the head?
[01:35:21] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: I am loading the entire <head> into a var so I can replace it on an ajax call
[01:35:23] <risky> I tried to do it rhough the input button, but i needs to be clicked twice
[01:35:43] <jrockjiggz> Kingsy: it should work...
[01:35:45] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: but all that really needs to be changed is the <title>
[01:35:54] <Kingsy> so I might try and grab just that instead
[01:36:26] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/D84k2/ <-- how would I make it so that not all the new additions flashes when I insert a new one? You will see the effect when you insert 2 or more
[01:36:54] <jrockjiggz> Kingsy: $('head').html()
[01:37:46] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: oh, rehprase sorry, how would I find the <head> in a variable?     for example at the moment I am using this to find markup    .find('.hello');
[01:38:04] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: sorry your right that does work using a standard jquery selector
[01:38:09] <Kingsy> but I need to find it in a var
[01:38:22] <jrockjiggz> var.find('head')
[01:38:33] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: done that, it returns nothing
[01:38:37] <ura> hi
[01:38:39] <Kingsy> well an empty object
[01:38:56] <Kingsy> jrockjiggz: console.log(jQuery(a).find('title'));     outputs -->    [
[01:39:01] <Kingsy> [ ] *
[01:39:53] <ura> I'm working with jquery validate. It has a 'success' option, but it does not have an 'error' option.  When I'm setting class "ok" for error label in success, how can I remove it in case of invalid input?
[01:40:04] <jrockjiggz> console.log(a)
[01:40:19] <diverdud`> I took this very simple gmap example: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple.html. I put my key in there and set sensor to true. Perfect..everything works great. Then i went to my google api console and into the map console. I see that no domains has been added to this key, so anybody can refer, so its great that it just works directly. Then i intentionally put one domain which i have no access to
[01:40:19] <diverdud`> refer from, so this key should only work with this domain. I try to relaod my simple gmap site and it still works great even though i refer from localhost, which has absolutely nothing to do with the domain i entered in the console... So...If its that easy to use a key...everybody can use my key. How do i protect it?
[01:42:18] <arunce> diverdud`: clean your cookies and try again from localhost
[01:42:42] <ura> please look at jQuery.Validate example: http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/milk/
[01:43:10] <ura> when you enter valid email, class "checked" are added to error label, but it never removed, even when input become wrong
[01:43:57] <ura> is there any callback for label which is called in case of invalid input? so I can have a possibility to remove "checked" class
[01:44:12] <diverdud`> arunce: after cleaning cookies it still works great even though its not supposed to
[01:45:05] <arunce> diverdud`: interesting.
[01:46:14] <diverdud`> arunce: can you reproduce that error?
[01:46:58] <arunce> maybe isn't an error, but can't reproduce it now. sorry.
[01:47:13] <diverdud`> arunce: what else should it be?
[01:47:47] <diverdud`> arunce: the problem is there is no google people i can talk to regarding this matter
[01:48:02] <Cristen> Hi everyone, i'm using boxy to open a modal box. Inside there is a form with a submit button. When I try to add a $("#submit").click() it doesn't work, but when I try with .live('click') it is working, I can't figure out why ??
[01:48:48] <Cristen> The problem is that if I close the modal box and reopen it when i'm using .live the code is executed twice ...
[01:52:38] <jrockjiggz> Cristen: .die('click').live('click',.....
[01:52:47] <diverdud`> anyone?
[01:52:54] <Cristen> i'll try jrockjiggz
[01:54:10] <Cristen> nice it works jrockjiggz !
[01:54:13] <jrockjiggz> :)
[01:55:05] <Cristen> btw if you have time could you explain why the click doesn't work ? I don't like to not understand where the problem is
[01:56:38] <toxz> offtopic: does anyone know a php irc channel? i cant join #php - invite only :-(
[01:56:56] <diverdud`> toxz: ##php
[01:57:03] <jrockjiggz> you can only bind events to elements that exists in the DOM. if it is not in the dom tree, then jquery doesn't find it.  .live is for elements that may exist in the future
[01:57:26] <jrockjiggz> ?live
[01:57:31] <Cristen> even if the code is wrapped inside a document ready ?
[01:57:37] <jrockjiggz> yep
[01:57:42] <toxz> diverdud` : thx!
[01:57:49] <diverdud`> toxz: no worries
[01:58:08] <Cristen> Ok I understand now thanks
[02:00:59] <edgardo> I got my solution, but it's now very optimal :)
[02:01:11] <edgardo> i'd really like to know the right way to do it
[02:01:13] <diverdud`> edgardo: can you help me?
[02:01:40] <edgardo> I've been jquerying for a little bit over a week :)
[02:01:53] <edgardo> so I'm not that good at it hehe
[02:02:09] <diverdud`> edgardo: but can you help me with google maps
[02:02:42] <edgardo> yes, I can help you find places there.. but other than that, unfortunally no
[02:04:54] <seena> hi all
[02:05:20] <seena> Is anyone using sencha touch
[02:05:25] <diverdud`> seena: no
[02:08:03] <seena> <diverdud'>: Can u please tell me in which freenode i have to this question
[02:13:29] <diverdud`> seena: sure, if you can help me out with my question
[02:14:08] <seena> yes
[02:15:07] <diverdud`> seena: with gmaps. do you know those?
[02:15:23] <seena> u mean google maps
[02:15:28] <diverdud`> yeh
[02:15:52] <seena> yes i have some idea about tha
[02:16:57] <diverdud`> seena: ok...do you know why i can use my key just fie even though u set the referer to a completely different site than the one im loading the map from?
[02:17:04] <diverdud`> fie=fine
[02:18:05] <lyrae> I have  vertical list nav bar. I'd like to make it so when i hover over a link, a background color grows from left to right. is it possible? (i know you can use an image and use a loop to move it the right,but i can't use images)
[02:19:48] <seena> google does that for security purpose, so they can track you using that key
[02:21:37] <Ankabout> how do I use .animate() if I want it to animate to "height: inherit" ??
[02:21:56] <Ankabout> because according to the docs (and my experimentation) it can only animate to hardcoded numeric values?
[02:22:18] <Cork> ya, so you need to calculate the inherited heght
[02:22:28] <mparodi> Hello
[02:22:30] <Cork> after animate is done, you can reset it to inherit
[02:23:05] <diverdud`> seena: nono...thats not what i mean
[02:23:07] <mparodi> I didn't found any good lib to create graph (maths graphs) and then be able to parse them so I'm building my own using JQ and JQUI
[02:23:10] <Ankabout> Cork, before I animate you mean?
[02:23:14] <diverdud`> seena: I took this very simple gmap example: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple.html. I put my key in there and set sensor to true. Perfect..everything works great. Then i went to my google api console and into the map console. I see that no domains has been added to this key, so anybody can refer, so its great that it just works directly. Then i intentionally put one domain which i have no
[02:23:15] <diverdud`> access to refer from, so this key should only work with this domain. I try to relaod my simple gmap site and it still works great even though i refer from localhost, which has absolutely nothing to do with the domain i entered in the console... So...If its that easy to use a key...everybody can use my key. How do i protect it?
[02:23:17] <Ankabout> let me make a fiddle quick, that might help
[02:23:24] <mparodi> I don't have idea how to connect nodes, any idea would be extremely appreciated!
[02:23:36] <lyrae> for(int i :a){  what is that?
[02:23:39] <mparodi> s/found/find/
[02:23:52] <Cork> Ankabout: that depends on your markup
[02:24:08] <Cork> lyrae: not js
[02:24:27] <lyrae> yep wrong channel. sorry
[02:24:51] <edgardo> lyrae, sec.. I'm making an illustration :)
[02:25:47] <Ankabout> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kY4Nk/
[02:25:54] <mparodi> the idea is to create two divs. then create a link from one to another. I have to be able to "save" this graph and then process it in server side. any idea about how to connect them and keep the information of the links?
[02:26:53] <Cork> Ankabout: and what is it you want to do?
[02:27:02] <Ankabout> Cork, so 2 things I need to figure out. How to animate to a dynamic height to fit the contents, and how to make sure that if you hover out, it reverses. Unless you hover into a sibling, then it should just move smoothly
[02:27:53] <Ankabout> oh nevermind, the part of making it reverse is easy :)
[02:27:54] <Cork> Ankabout: you could do something like setting visibility: hidden (or opacity: 0)
[02:27:58] <Cork> the grab its height
[02:28:10] <Cork> the set the shorter height, and animate to the full height
[02:28:44] <edgardo> lyrae, would something like this work: http://i40.tinypic.com/5dro68.png
[02:28:54] <edgardo> with css animation
[02:29:09] <Ankabout> wouldn't that make it jump a bit on loading?
[02:29:25] <edgardo> of course teh background is a css gradient
[02:30:27] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I am getting date by 'Date' object. is it possible to get the date of tomorrow ? or I need to convert date to number and increase that by "1" mannually?
[02:31:08] <Cork> Paveloosha: setDate(d.getDate()+1)
[02:33:06] <berger_> hi! is on the new bind?
[02:33:21] <Cork> berger_: its a new combination
[02:33:33] <Cork> its bind, live delegate all rolled into one
[02:33:55] <Cork> depending on the arguments
[02:34:03] <berger_> Cork:  so it's not that the others are deprecated?
[02:34:09] <Cork> no
[02:34:45] <berger_> Cork:  is there any advantage in using it then?
[02:34:57] <Cork> not that i know of
[02:34:59] <Paveloosha> Cork, thank you very much..
[02:35:08] <Cork> Paveloosha: np
[02:36:26] <Cork> 1.7 changed how event flows so upgrading from to it is a lot of work if you use many events
[02:36:34] <Cork> so i haven't gone there yet
[02:45:33] <luxigo> how do you start a file download with jquery ?..
[02:45:56] <helpcrypto> hi folks
[02:46:22] <yamahaalex> i finished my lovely jquery slider
[02:46:24] <helpcrypto> need to do something, and i guess it already exist, so ask before redoing the wheel
[02:46:30] <yamahaalex> but realized, its on ever page
[02:46:34] <yamahaalex> how can i limit jquery to one page
[02:46:59] <helpcrypto> i need a modal dialog window (that gray out the background components), but with 2 features:
[02:47:13] <helpcrypto> 1-can load a url inside (not just like an alert)
[02:47:38] <helpcrypto> 2-data must be "received", using something like a callback
[02:47:41] <helpcrypto> for example:
[02:48:27] <helpcrypto> page for ask dialog to open "users.php" and when the form is closed, accepted or whatever button invoked/closed...the data or info is received on page
[02:48:31] <helpcrypto> any idea?
[02:55:23] <Ortund> I have jquery script that I downloaded (QuickFlip2) that only seems to animate randomly. Every example I've seen has it animating consistently, but I can't seem to get mine to. There are no errors and I believe I've implemented it properly, can anyone advise how to fix it?
[02:57:15] <mparodi> ??element
[02:57:22] <mparodi> ahm, how do I use the bot?
[02:58:01] <diverdud`> is there really nobody who knows about google maps?
[02:58:23] <mparodi> if I'm not wrong I can add data to any DOM element, I can't remember how. anyone knows?
[02:58:41] <mparodi> oh, never mind, $.data :)

[03:03:41] <Ankabout> if you move from red to blue, over the green, all 3 animations happen. How can I avoid  that?
[03:04:37] <Gavrisimo> Hello everyone. I am using jQuery Validate plugin to validate some fields and what i need to do is "when user makes focus to some form field that has been validated, i.e. it has error class and error message showing, i need to remove error class from form field and remove error label for that field". What i did is "$("input, select").focus()" and then i do what i need to do. Everything works, but when on select inputs it first remov
[03:05:26] <helpcrypto> Ankabout:  dont use .class selector
[03:05:28] <helpcrypto> use id instead
[03:05:34] <helpcrypto> #block-1
[03:06:23] <Ankabout> helpcrypto, no they all have to animate, but when I move to the green one, and on the way there I moved over red and blue, it shouldn't wait for the first 2 animations to finish
[03:07:44] <helpcrypto> Ankabout:  then, it must be a sync issue. try doing some async investigation
[03:08:31] <Ankabout> helpcrypto, sorry no idea what you're talking about
[03:09:25] <helpcrypto> Ankabout:  you make the following: on move over->expand, on mouse out->collapse
[03:09:35] <helpcrypto> the events are sended "on time" to the div
[03:09:36] <sunscreen> jesus this php file/progress bar upload is a mucky business
[03:09:41] <helpcrypto> and do it one, after another
[03:09:49] <sunscreen> there seems to be now ideal solutions
[03:10:16] <helpcrypto> you seem to want "collapse" happend before expand ends, right?
[03:10:25] <helpcrypto> then, you should "cancel" the first order
[03:10:33] <helpcrypto> do you undertand what i mean?
[03:10:46] <sunscreen> the best one ive seen so far is jquery-file-upload ... but they has some serious issue integrating into anything than its own demo example page

[03:12:39] <diverdud`> is it possible to include a js file from jquery?
[03:12:50] <sunscreen> aquantium is jquery-file-upload
[03:13:17] <helpcrypto> sunscreen:  aquantum doesnt use swf :)
[03:13:43] <helpcrypto> diverdud`:  ask google for "dinamic import javascript from jquery" or such things
[03:14:01] <Ortund> I have jquery script that I downloaded (QuickFlip2) that only seems to animate randomly. Every example I've seen has it animating consistently, but I can't seem to get mine to. There are no errors and I believe I've implemented it properly, can anyone advise how to fix it?
[03:14:29] <sunscreen> i would love to use it but they integrated it into the jquery themes which makes it difficult to understand .. there scripts wont even bind to the page properly in my site
[03:15:57] <sunscreen> also it makes for bloat
[03:15:59] <dax_roc> Morning all
[03:17:04] <Xotix> what does datatables require for zero init? just table thead table?
[03:18:16] <dax_roc> I've an appended form on a modal dialog, I want retreive the values in the confirm callback, I've tried using $('#fieldId', this).val(); but it's undefined. but the 'this' html contents does contain the id ?
[03:21:45] <sunscreen> also aquantum also does not even actually work ... every file i gave it it claimed was too small
[03:22:15] <sunscreen> this was after in frustration trying to use it in a iframe
[03:25:13] <sunscreen> http://www.webappers.com/2011/11/14/tutorial-html5-file-upload-with-progress-bar/ <--- going to try this
[03:26:04] <Ankabout> helpcrypto, sorry phone
[03:26:05] <Ankabout> back again
[03:26:38] <Ankabout> yes, that's correct, before the expand finishes, if the mouse leaves I want to cancel it.
[03:26:41] <Ankabout> how would I go about that?
[03:27:45] <helpcrypto> Ankabout:  google cancel jquery animation :P
[03:28:38] <Ankabout> ah ok thanks
[03:34:53] <dwarder_> how can you understand that plugin doesn't work 'cause of it is old and jquery is new?
[03:34:59] <dwarder_> can it be like that?
[03:35:14] <dwarder_> or jquery is absolutely backward compatible?
[03:37:10] <Ortund> This looks weird >>> var d = d || {};    ... erm, wth
[03:37:44] <edgardo> I use a $(el).submit(... function to create an element to my list. It includes a remove button which doesnt work until I refresh the page
[03:37:49] <edgardo> anyone know why?
[03:39:29] <XMan2012> I am looking for  a jquery plugin for notification system just like on this following example(http://blogs.hbr.org/taylor/2011/11/dont_let_what_you_know_limit_w.html) ..... there are always something notify on the right bottom of the page...
[03:39:51] <XMan2012> just like this http://moreco.de/slide-note/demo/
[03:39:57] <XMan2012> but with a kind of timmer
[03:40:38] <XMan2012> how can i define a set of time on this above notification message popup
[03:48:33] <dwarder> why this thing doesn't work
[03:48:35] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/WFML7/1/
[03:51:07] <bethebunny> So this should be massively easy but I've spent 2 hours on it already. How the shit do I select all items with class=x, and then set their html based on their id?
[03:51:54] <bethebunny> I tried $('.x').each(function(index, item) {item.innerHtml = makeHtml(item.id);});
[03:52:04] <bethebunny> but that somehow doesn't work
[03:52:07] <seutje> damn I suck at regex shit
[03:52:07] <bethebunny> what am I doing wrong?
[03:54:19] <coldhead> $item.html(makeHtml(item.id))
[03:54:43] <coldhead> $(item).html(makeHtml(item.id)) even
[03:55:11] <bethebunny> ok, cool
[03:55:41] <bethebunny> why does innerHtml = x not update the attribute? other js libraries I've used don't muck with this behavior
[03:56:16] <coldhead> i doubt jQuery would muck with it
[03:56:21] <helpcrypto> ill ask again
[03:56:31] <helpcrypto> i need a modal dialog window (that gray out the background components), but with 2 features:
[03:56:48] <helpcrypto> 1-can load a url/div with images inside (not just like an alert)
[03:56:48] <coldhead> bethebunny: isn't the attr innerHTML, not innerHtml?
[03:56:57] <coldhead> i have never used innerHtml
[03:57:03] <helpcrypto> 2-data must be "received" after closing, using something like a callback
[03:57:27] <coldhead> ?modal @ helpcrypto
[03:57:43] <bethebunny> coldhead: maybe? I've always used it as innerHtml, chrome at least allows both and on other websites eg. not loading jquery, innerHtml will update the value appropriately
[03:57:44] <coldhead> oh god the bot is dead
[03:57:44] <helpcrypto> for example: page shows dialog to open "users.php" and when the dialog is closed, accepted or whatever button invoked/closed...the data or info from "users.php" is received on page
[03:57:59] <larsemil> Why do i get this error in IE: Object does not support this action, when doing item=$('.class .' + string);
[03:58:10] <larsemil> Works fine in both IE and Firefox
[03:58:23] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  does modal works for the example i said?
[03:58:24] <coldhead> helpcrypto: i haven't used this in a while but it has the features you describe http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/
[03:58:33] <coldhead> there are thousands of others
[03:58:39] <coldhead> maybe millions
[03:58:46] <helpcrypto> im looking for something more "standard"
[03:59:04] <bethebunny> however, using the jquery library appropriately is a better solution xD pretty new to this. Is there a page in the jquery docs that just lists all of the things you can do with selections?
[03:59:07] <coldhead> the Official Standard is jQuery UI modal
[03:59:16] <helpcrypto> but that doesnt allow to receive data
[03:59:18] <coldhead> it comes with a certificate of authenticity
[03:59:21] <helpcrypto> or forms
[03:59:26] <helpcrypto> just show and hide
[03:59:33] <helpcrypto> no callback possibility...
[03:59:52] <coldhead> wow, that's pretty crappy
[04:00:09] <helpcrypto> ¿?
[04:01:36] <helpcrypto> uses form where you have too look for "family members". A modal view of "getfamily.php" is shown, and when some of them are selected you press ok on that...and the values are returned to the user form
[04:01:45] <larsemil> Why do i get this error in IE: Object does not support this action, when doing item=$('.class .' + string);
[04:02:38] <Cork> larsemil: do you have some code you can show that isn't semi code?
[04:03:01] <coldhead> helpcrypto: did you look at this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[04:03:14] <coldhead> it seems to have a form and a callback
[04:03:20] <coldhead> and i bet you could jam images in there too
[04:03:58] <donCams> need help with this script http://pastebin.com/crdAkCxA
[04:04:21] <larsemil> Cork: http://newteknikdalen.destinator.se/814.php
[04:04:24] <yamahaalex> is it possible to integrate paypal into a site, and not use that paypal external checkout page
[04:04:26] <donCams> it should show the next div and hide the current one without the browser going back to the top. how do I make that happen?
[04:04:39] <donCams> i have e.preventDefault() but it's still doing that
[04:04:51] <larsemil> donCams: preventDefault should do that.
[04:04:57] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  that doesnt seem to have a callback...or i cant see it.
[04:05:00] <donCams> why is it not?
[04:05:15] <larsemil> Cork: it works fine in Firefox and IE
[04:07:04] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  no. definetively, it doesnt seem to have a callback. so i cannot retrieve data from the dialog
[04:07:19] <coldhead> helpcrypto: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close
[04:07:48] <coldhead> that looks like a callback to me
[04:07:55] <coldhead> but i am not sure, i have never used UI
[04:07:57] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  but then...the user form should..."parse" the page or what?
[04:08:03] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[04:08:09] <helpcrypto> lol
[04:08:14] <donCams> anybody knows why? :(
[04:08:18] <helpcrypto> then, forget it :P
[04:08:19] <Cork> larsemil: wasn't it ie you had problem in?
[04:08:45] <helpcrypto> donCams:  could you paste a running one on jsfiddle?
[04:08:57] <donCams> http://nlpgraduates.com/challenge/swsoft-quiz/
[04:09:14] <Cork> larsemil: ie's debugger sucks, but it doesn't looks like item is a complete jquery object
[04:09:27] <Cork> larsemil: it's a bit weird
[04:10:22] <helpcrypto> donCams:  ok...page opened...what to look for?
[04:10:31] <Ortund> http://pop.netgendns.co.za/Work.aspx           <<< the 3 smaller disks on the right animate sometimes when you click on them, an othertimes they just disappear to be replaced with the "flip" image... can anyone help me figure out why this is?
[04:10:50] <donCams> slick start
[04:10:54] <donCams> *click
[04:11:01] <Cork> larsemil: AH! you haven't declared your variables
[04:11:13] <Cork> larsemil: add var infrom of item and active
[04:11:18] <Cork> *infront
[04:11:43] <Cork> (and itemindex and activeindes and jumps and so on)
[04:11:48] <helpcrypto> donCams:  you are reloading the page...thats why the "scroll" is moved
[04:12:05] <donCams> why is it reloading the page? I have set e.preventDefault()
[04:12:07] <helpcrypto> if you want to scroll to a certaing part, try using #anchors
[04:12:20] <dwarder> how can i find out if plugin doesn't work 'cause of jquery plugin
[04:12:27] <dwarder> -plugin
[04:12:29] <helpcrypto> ok, let me check the code
[04:13:00] <helpcrypto> its your next a button?
[04:13:04] <helpcrypto> inside a form?
[04:13:11] <helpcrypto> then...use anchors
[04:13:19] <helpcrypto> preventDefault is for "forms"
[04:13:29] <donCams> helpcrypto, they're links
[04:13:36] <helpcrypto> thats why its moving
[04:13:39] <donCams> crap... i also have return false; there earlier
[04:13:40] <helpcrypto> you are moving to #
[04:13:54] <helpcrypto> you know what html anchors are?
[04:14:01] <helpcrypto> like #name ?
[04:14:08] <donCams> nevermind
[04:14:08] <helpcrypto> or #myDiv ?
[04:14:26] <helpcrypto> use anchors, or use a form with return false
[04:14:33] <helpcrypto> o preventDefault
[04:14:45] <donCams> don't know but this code used to work with .live
[04:14:56] <helpcrypto> donCams:  listen to me
[04:15:15] <helpcrypto> the "question container"...add a name attribute, like an id
[04:15:20] <helpcrypto> in fact, the same as id
[04:15:30] <helpcrypto> and then, on your next button
[04:15:34] <helpcrypto> instead of #
[04:15:43] <helpcrypto> use "#your-name"
[04:15:56] <helpcrypto> <a href="#your-name">
[04:16:03] <helpcrypto> that should do the trick
[04:16:34] <dwarder> his name is magic
[04:16:47] <helpcrypto> #magic ¿?
[04:16:55] <donCams> wut? nevermind, i'll just change this too ul anyways
[04:16:55] <larsemil> Cork: ah okay will try that!
[04:17:33] <helpcrypto> donCams:  imho, you should go #wordpress
[04:17:44] <fff> hi
[04:18:11] <larsemil> Cork: that solved it. thanks. now i know for future use, always write var. :)
[04:18:38] <Cork> larsemil: what happend was you replaced window.index
[04:18:51] <Cork> and ie then replaced it with the default value
[04:19:07] <Cork> larsemil: its actually more important then that
[04:19:24] <larsemil> Cork: i did not know that. thanks for the update
[04:19:38] <Cork> larsemil: if you don't write var, your variable ends up in the global scope, and that means multible event and loops and what ever uses THE SAME VARIABLE
[04:19:46] <Cork> so you will get really scary bugs
[04:20:08] <larsemil> that is also very interesting.
[04:20:44] <Cork> temporarly adding "use strict"; at the top of the file, and testing in firefox or chrome will show all the errors :)
[04:20:51] <Cork> cause its invalid in that mode
[04:21:11] <Cork> larsemil: but make sure to remove it when your done or it can have effects you don't want
[04:21:53] <larsemil> Cork: ok cool, not used to working with js at all so i learn new stuff all the time
[04:23:29] <Cork> larsemil: as long as your learning from your mistakes everything is worth it :)
[04:25:05] <runtyrobot> I have a weird issue, when using .animate() to adjust zoom. On mouse out - it returns to the required zoom level - but pops up to zoom: 1; after the animation is complete..  But ONLY if the zoom level it's returning to, is the same as the original one - as defined in my css document.. So if it's 0.7 in the CSS and I set the animation to 0.8 - there's no problem. But if it's 0.7 both places, it
[04:25:05] <runtyrobot> messes up.. wth
[04:26:00] <coldhead> helpcrypto: http://jsfiddle.net/htyrK/1/
[04:26:08] <coldhead> is that something like what you want?
[04:26:58] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  NO
[04:27:22] <helpcrypto> thats a nasty solution for a problem that should be solved with a callback
[04:27:30] <coldhead> that uses a callback
[04:27:42] <coldhead> close: function is a callback
[04:27:46] <helpcrypto> that iterates trough the inputs
[04:27:50] <coldhead> maybe i don't know what callbacks are?
[04:28:46] <coldhead> helpcrypto: http://jsfiddle.net/htyrK/2/
[04:28:52] <coldhead> any better
[04:29:00] <helpcrypto> if component A need some data from component B...its not an elegant solution "looping" on B inputs form A. B should return the data to A, and A use it in any way
[04:29:25] <Ortund> http://pop.netgendns.co.za/Work.aspx           <<< the 3 smaller disks on the right animate sometimes when you click on them, an othertimes they just disappear to be replaced with the "flip" image... can anyone help me figure out why this is?
[04:29:37] <coldhead> man i have so much to learn, sorry helpcrypto
[04:29:40] <helpcrypto> altough is less painful, data is not a form only
[04:29:45] <helpcrypto> could be json data
[04:29:49] <bonhoffer> why can't i run "$.getJSON(" in js console -- i get : Object bound: function () { return document.getElementById.apply(document, arguments) } has no method 'getJSON'
[04:29:54] <bonhoffer> i thought i ran that before
[04:30:01] <helpcrypto> coldhead:  np
[04:30:09] <bonhoffer> i want to test out my function
[04:30:25] <coldhead> bonhoffer: try replacing $ with jQuery
[04:30:31] <bonhoffer> will do
[04:31:08] <bonhoffer> jQuery is not defined
[04:31:26] <coldhead> that could be the cause of your problems with jquery
[04:31:37] <bonhoffer> oh -- so my console needs to be on a page that loads jquery -- got it
[04:32:42] <edgardo> Can anyone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/rsqge/ <-- the remove buttons won't work on newly created items from the form
[04:33:45] <Ortund> my link is bad, sorry... it's http://pop.netgendns.co.za/Partners.aspx      <<< 3 disks on the right only animate the "flip" sometimes, can anyone help me find out why?
[04:36:09] <coldhead> helpcrypto: i found this other thing too http://jsfiddle.net/htyrK/3/
[04:36:22] <edgardo> Ortund, it doesn't animate for me at all.. just disappears and re-appears flipped
[04:36:39] <uchuff> ditto what edgardo said
[04:36:48] <Ortund> try refreshing a couple of times
[04:37:08] <Ortund> I've found that the animation happens randomly (at best) ... I need it to animate consistently

[04:39:15] <risky> hi how do I append a table row just before the last row ?
[04:39:24] <risky> .. in a table?
[04:39:46] <bonhoffer> coldhead: works on the right page
[04:39:54] <bonhoffer> now to get the results into an object . . .
[04:40:47] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/htyrK/4/
[04:42:13] <coldhead> risky: $('table tr:last').before('<tr><td>second last</td></tr>')
[04:42:27] <bonhoffer> is there a way to use .getJSON('/foo.json', function (d) { var foo = d; }); and now i can play with foo ?
[04:42:37] <bonhoffer> to parse it correctly
[04:44:11] <risky> clockwize: do I append after the before ?
[04:44:11] <Aamir> risky:  $yourtable.find('tr:last').before('<tr>..</tr>')
[04:44:15] <Umren> how to select type="Login" in jquery?
[04:44:25] <clockwize> boo
[04:44:29] <Aamir> risky: http://jsfiddle.net/htyrK/5/
[04:44:39] <coldhead> clockwize: yay!
[04:44:41] <edgardo> phew. got it working now.. had to use $('#newAddition').on("click", ".removeButton", function() { <<<< instead of $('.removeButton').click(function() {
[04:45:09] <Aamir> Umren:  $("input[type='Login']") not sure if there is such a type thought :P
[04:45:22] <Aamir> ?attribute selector @Umren
[04:45:51] <Umren> Aamir: yeah it works, thanks
[04:45:53] <edgardo> btw, is there any REAL difference between using $('#element') or $("#element")
[04:46:00] <Umren> no
[04:46:02] <edgardo> or is it just a matter of personal preference
[04:46:09] <coldhead> " is harder to type
[04:46:17] <coldhead> so it's slower
[04:46:18] <bonhoffer> really my question is can i use jQuery.getJSON to load the results into a variable (object)
[04:46:19] <edgardo> yeah, for me too
[04:46:28] <Aamir> lol coldhead
[04:47:01] <coldhead> i think that's what you're supposed to use getJSON for bonhoffer
[04:47:06] <Aamir> bonhoffer: why not
[04:47:16] <coldhead> otherwise why would you use it, if you just throw the data away
[04:47:21] <bonhoffer> i see now. . . just a little tricky http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2177548/load-json-into-variable
[04:47:44] <bonhoffer> well, agreed, but i wanted to get a variable i could play with in console, not a success function that uses the data
[04:48:18] <edgardo> what is the syntax if I want to make the same function to two different elements at once? $('#el1','#el2') didn't work
[04:48:19] <quicksilver> bonhoffer: that stack overflow question just has a stupid bug
[04:48:28] <bonhoffer> oh, good to know
[04:48:42] <quicksilver> bonhoffer: (using 'var' on my_json inside the callback makes it a local variable)
[04:48:53] <quicksilver> if you delete that second var it would work fine.
[04:48:56] <bonhoffer> got it -- i see now
[04:49:50] <discorpia> edgardo: dont end the string, i.e. $('#el1, #el2')
[04:50:32] <bonhoffer> works great
[04:50:33] <edgardo> discorpia, ah it was that easy :)
[04:50:35] <edgardo> thanks
[04:51:13] <bonhoffer> is there a good reference on how to parse json
[04:51:25] <bonhoffer> now that i have the variable
[04:51:41] <quicksilver> bonhoffer: you don't have to parse it!
[04:51:53] <quicksilver> JSON is javascript data - you are in javascript - you just use it.
[04:52:04] <quicksilver> (admittedly, jquery parsed it for you - that's what http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/ is for )
[04:52:11] <bonhoffer> wrong word -- i have json_data, now i want all meeting_dates of each object
[04:52:52] <bonhoffer> so i used the wrong phrase - i meant "use json" json.meeting_dates .  . doesn't work
[04:53:01] <quicksilver> well, this is just a matter of programming.
[04:53:10] <quicksilver> foo.meeting_dates will work for each one.
[04:53:21] <quicksilver> if you have to get them from multiple objects - use a for loop?
[04:53:58] <bonhoffer> got it -- there is no .map function . . . json.map{|d| d.meeting_date}
[04:54:20] <bonhoffer> because i want an array of meeting_dates
[04:54:24] <quicksilver> well, jQuery has a map function and an each function
[04:54:38] <bonhoffer> sweet -- i'll check it out
[04:54:44] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[04:54:49] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[04:55:09] <quicksilver> actually I think that's the wrong link
[04:55:10] <quicksilver> hmm
[04:55:37] <quicksilver> yes
[04:55:42] <quicksilver> bonhoffer: I actually meant http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[04:55:52] <quicksilver> and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[04:56:13] <quicksilver> the first links I gave you only work over jQuery objects (DOM result sets). The second pair can be used on any arbitrary array
[04:56:25] <bonhoffer> nice!
[04:56:28] <quicksilver> really these are standard functions which are "missing" from javascript
[04:56:39] <quicksilver> jQuery fills them in althoguh other good javascript libraries have them
[04:56:45] <discorpia> edgardo: np =) it's just like css selectors
[04:59:51] <bonhoffer> quicksilver: i'm almost there $.map(my_json, function (val,i) { dates += val.meeting_date}); -- is push the best way to do this?
[05:01:16] <quicksilver> you don't need to use push
[05:01:19] <bonhoffer> works well
[05:01:22] <bonhoffer> no ?
[05:01:25] <quicksilver> the purpose of $.map is to return a new array automatically
[05:01:42] <bonhoffer> oh . . . glad i revealed my mistake
[05:01:46] <quicksilver> just return val.meeting_date
[05:02:03] <quicksilver> if you were using 'each' then push would be the right way
[05:02:14] <quicksilver> map is like an each with a built in 'push' to a newly constructed array

[05:03:19] <subdesign> hi, recommended picture slider script?
[05:06:11] <mdevilz> Hi, I am trying to use the datepicker, however no matter what I do, the datepicker only modifies the 1st input field, and not the one that it is attached to. Is there any i should be doing: code http://jsfiddle.net/dMTRv/2/
[05:15:08] <terryleigh> hi guys, I've got a form that's loaded via .ajax when I link is clicked... how do I monitor when that forms button is clicked as jquery isn't picking it up afterwards?
[05:17:30] <cssapiquery> how can I get the top value of a dom element with the px?
[05:18:03] <cssapiquery> I think I did this before, but it is infuriating - having to remember APIs instead of them being obvious - I tried top() and css('top').... maybe I made a mistake
[05:18:07] <dwarder> can anyone help me with http://jsfiddle.net/xj7ue/
[05:18:24] <dwarder> why it doesn't look like http://akzhan.github.com/jwysiwyg/help/examples/01-basic.html
[05:18:53] <cssapiquery> 1.7
[05:18:53] <Mullie> If I do jQuery('#commentform').bind("submit", function() { it just happens on the first commentform. Is it because it is selected by ID?
[05:19:12] <cssapiquery> Mullie: since only one thing will be selected, the nyes
[05:19:26] <juha_> Mullie: id is unique, use class or something else
[05:19:33] <Mullie> Ok
[05:20:14] <thinkt4nk> Mullie: also, if you're not using live(), use live()
[05:20:16] <dwarder> anyone&
[05:20:18] <dwarder> ?
[05:20:23] <thinkt4nk> or bind after the ajax call
[05:20:46] <juha_> Mullie: forms are dickheads, i usually have to wrap multiple forms inside container element and then bind it like this: $(".myContainer").delegate("form", "submit", function() { lol(); });
[05:22:05] <thinkt4nk> dwarder: they look roughly the same to me
[05:22:39] <thinkt4nk> only difference looks like the width
[05:22:53] <thinkt4nk> "575px" set directly on the element in the fiddle
[05:24:26] <dwarder> i guess it was cache problem or something
[05:26:02] <dealt> greetings
[05:26:44] <amirite> done
[05:26:46] <amirite> finally

[05:28:25] <NoNoNo> $(window).load() does not trigger inside a $() = DOMready function?
[05:31:47] <NicolasDas> hi!, i need to implement a dialog box when an user submit in a forum but after the data is sent.
[05:31:55] <NicolasDas> i need some pointers here pls :)
[05:36:39] <terryleigh> I can't set events on elements that I've added with jquery... how do I go about that.. do I have to reload the dom?
[05:36:59] <thinkt4nk> live(), use live()
[05:37:48] <tom__> what's a good guide to documenting/commenting jq plugins?
[05:38:22] <yamahaalex37> h
[05:39:41] <Ankabout> is there a way to avoid animations waiting for each other?
[05:40:01] <Ankabout> for example I have two animate() events right after each other, and by default one waits for the previous one to finish
[05:41:33] <amitprakash> Hi is it possible to automatically create the request parameters using a pre-filled form on the document? If so, how?
[05:43:10] <NicolasDas> Ankabout: the two animations are in diferent divs?
[05:43:29] <Ankabout> yes
[05:43:43] <Ankabout> NicolasDas, http://jsfiddle.net/kY4Nk/3/
[05:45:27] <donCams> hi again. say I have <ul></ul> each <li></li> with different content, I want to find the height of the tallest <li></li> inside, is that possible? how?
[05:46:47] <NicolasDas> Ankabout: You should do an if, if the mouse is over then do the animation with 400 pixels of height, if the mouse is not over then it should do the other animation
[05:47:50] <Ankabout> NicolasDas, the idea is that the other ones pop out, but if you move to the next box while the first is still animating, it should continue, then go back to the smaller state, but the new one you hovered to should not have to wait
[05:47:54] <Ankabout> if that makes any sense?
[05:48:09] <Zogot> Ankabout : like this?
[05:48:09] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/kY4Nk/4/
[05:48:15] <Zogot> Sorry, just tuned in
[05:48:55] <Ankabout> Zogot, almost perfect
[05:50:09] <Ankabout> it doesn't have to go back to the 30px height though
[05:50:21] <Ankabout> but that's much better than I had it already! awesome thanks
[05:50:41] <Zogot> Fair enough
[05:51:30] <Ankabout> I'm gonna need an if in there if I want it to stay at 100px height right?
[05:51:50] <Ankabout> because right  now that statement that makes it 40 is used for all onmouseouts
[05:53:20] <terryleigh> thinkt4nk: ok lives working on the submit button, but I still can't get it to get the values of the form fields?
[05:54:04] <Zogot> Ankabout: like so: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/kY4Nk/5/?
[05:54:31] <Ankabout> perfect!
[05:54:40] <Ankabout> wow... now lemme find how you did that
[05:54:46] <Hypah> perpetual javascript newb here
[05:55:35] <Hypah> var o = document.getElementById("myDiv");  o.hello = "123";   <=- will this work on every browser? assigning an arbitrarily-named variable, and having its value permanently stick for scripting purposes?
[05:56:18] <erichynds> Hypah: yeah, although there is something about that pattern that's prone to memory leaks in internet explorer
[05:56:28] <erichynds> dunno the specifics though, or if it'll affect you.
[05:56:42] <aaronmcadam> also it's not really a good pattern to use anyway
[05:56:43] <erichynds> Hypah: also, that's what $.data() is for
[05:56:55] <aaronmcadam> erichynds++
[05:57:04] <Ankabout> Zogot, so you basically told all animations that as soon as they happen, everything else should stop?
[05:57:34] <Zogot> aye :p
[05:58:02] <Hypah> thanks erichynds, i will look into $.data()
[05:58:03] <Zogot> can get rid of the stop from line 7
[05:59:03] <Hypah> is saying "$.data()" the same as saying "jQuery.data()" ?
[05:59:08] <erichynds> yes
[05:59:19] <erichynds> ...assuming $ points to jQuery
[06:08:47] <Hypah> does jquery introduce anything equivalent to setInterval() ?
[06:09:04] <groundup> I am looking for a way to fade some text from red to yellow to green based on a percentage from 0 to 100 where 0 = red; 50 = yellow; 100 = green.I looked at xcolor (from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3951146/jquery-color-fade) but I don't understand how it would work to animate that.
[06:11:20] <terryleigh> using .live how do I get the values of the inputs on a generated form?
[06:11:36] <Zogot> $.val()
[06:11:37] <kedarm> How to best achieve the folding (collapse/expand) effect of certain sections (e.g. "advanced settings") on a page? Is slideToggle the way to go?
[06:12:43] <kedarm> (http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/)
[06:13:32] <terryleigh> Zogot: it keeps returning undefined...
[06:14:03] <Iszak> ?slideToggle @ terryleigh
[06:14:12] <Iszak> where is the bot :( tempel
[06:14:15] <Iszak> temp01: *
[06:14:20] <Zogot> wrong person anyway iszak
[06:14:36] <Iszak> yeah
[06:14:43] <dr0id> hello
[06:15:04] <Iszak> bots and droids, you can never count on them.
[06:15:11] <dr0id> why not
[06:15:20] <Iszak> because they always have hardware failures.
[06:15:36] <Zogot> terryleigh: What you mean by generated. The values of the input, or are you making new inputs with JS?
[06:16:13] <terryleigh> Zogot: I'm appending a form to the html and getting it with .ajax.
[06:16:28] <Zogot> terryleigh with the content filled in?
[06:16:50] <tp43> hi
[06:17:02] <dr0id> hi
[06:17:09] <Zogot> or a new form made, you press submit and your trying to get the new elements?
[06:17:35] <tp43> Would someone mind walking me through using this: https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.min.js
[06:18:18] <dr0id> heh
[06:18:58] <tp43> dr0id, c'mon, you busy?
[06:19:15] <erichynds> tp43: view the project's readme file
[06:19:16] <subdesign> hey , anyone help me? i want to set back the current pic in slideshow after page refresh.. using cookie but cant do that : http://jsfiddle.net/JK7rD/1/
[06:19:18] <dr0id> imthesameguyfrom##javascript
[06:19:20] <Iszak> tp43: would help if it wasn't minified
[06:19:39] <dr0id> let me help you then, https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.js
[06:19:41] <tp43> dr0id, I know
[06:20:18] <Iszak> tp43: basically it uses a number of means to determine if the document is ready, simple.
[06:20:58] <tp43> I can't get it to work, ok I copied the file and name it ready.min.js
[06:21:35] <tp43> then i put on the top of my page, <script type='text/javascript' src='ready.min.js'></script>
[06:22:04] <terryleigh> Zogot: sorry.. got it working :) thanks anyways
[06:23:19] <Iszak> tp43: check your console, are there any errors?
[06:23:53] <tp43> Iszak, yeah, it isn't recogizing $
[06:24:17] <Iszak> you haven't got jQuery included then?
[06:24:52] <Iszak> the domready function doesn't require jQuery or the $
[06:25:08] <Zogot> terryleigh: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/XwfUF/ oh well, me too :p
[06:26:25] <kavelot> is $('#id').autoSuggest(params) different from $.fn.autoSuggest($('#id'), params)?
[06:28:05] <tp43> dr0id, are you able to use it?
[06:28:45] <erichynds> kavelot: yes. the equiv would be $.fn.autoSuggest.call($("#id"), params); but I don't know why you'd ever write that
[06:29:21] <Iszak> for brevity
[06:29:24] <kavelot> autoSuggest is destroying the #id, so I'd like to get a return for the autoSuggest plugin
[06:29:35] <kavelot> just doing the other way also returns
[06:29:36] <kavelot> ?
[06:29:45] <kavelot> I remember with Jcrop it didn't work pretty well
[06:37:56] <tp43> I am having trouble using https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.min.js, https://gist.github.com/1423439
[06:38:00] <subdesign> how to force a string variable to be an integer?
[06:38:23] <Umren> there is focus, is there something like unfocus?
[06:38:45] <tp43> blur
[06:39:13] <Umren> subdesign: parseInt
[06:39:22] <subdesign> thx
[06:40:17] <Umren> tp43: yeah working, ty
[06:40:30] <tom__> i'm unsure of the documentation of .one()
[06:40:37] <tom__> if i do $elem.one('click', selector, handler), where $elem.filter(selector) yields several elements, and one of them gets clicked on, is the handler still active for the remaining target elements?
[06:41:13] <Jon47> tom_ do you mean .on ?
[06:41:15] <ajpiano> tom__: yes, i believe so
[06:41:21] <tom__> Jon47: one()
[06:41:41] <Jon47> ah neat, never seen that one before
[06:41:54] <tom__> so JQ is keeping state on which of these got clicked on?
[06:42:07] <tom__> Jon47: no pun intended ;-)
[06:42:32] <Jon47> tom__: it says at most once *per element* in the docs
[06:42:34] <kavelot> this autoSuggest plugin has a function add_selected_item() that I need to call after creating it... how can I call a function defined in a plugin?
[06:43:04] <tom__> kavelot: so it does. up at the top. i was looking for that in the detailed text arther than in the header
[06:43:06] <Jon47> i think the idea is just that it allows you to re-delegate handlers for events without having to worry about unbinding first
[06:43:28] <tom__> Jon47: Jon47* not kavelot
[06:43:29] <tom__> woops
[06:43:32] <Jon47> heh, np
[06:44:28] <tom__> i trying to write a plugin that can be used with or without delegation. it hurts my head
[06:44:43] <risky_s> hi i am trying to change the bg_color of a textarea when if nothing entered and it clicked outside changes back to the original color?
[06:47:16] <Jon47> risky_s what have you got so far?
[06:47:38] <seutje> not so much jquery related, but when using .replace on some innerText, it adds <br> elements in there, anyw way to avoid this? brain is failing on me
[06:47:56] <risky_s> well I got it so that when the textarea is clicked the background changes from a grey to white bg_color
[06:48:07] <risky_s> click event*
[06:48:30] <risky_s> now when I click outside of the textarea it needs to check if its empty and revert back to the old grey bg_color
[06:49:12] <Jon47> risky_s.. so what's the problem
[06:50:13] <risky_s> im not sure how to code it, i checked if it was empty but i keeps staying on grey
[06:50:32] <risky_s> it doesnt change to white because when clicked first time, it is obviously empty
[06:50:43] <risky_s> it needs to check after the first click
[06:52:00] <exnihilo> quick question, what is the best way to get sane address bar/back behavior when updating a page in response to an onclick using .load()?  I noticed the address bar plugin, but I want a second opinion
[06:52:45] <Zogot> exnihilo you mean like using hashbangs?
[06:53:04] <seutje>  heh, foo = document.getElementsByTagName('style'); foo.innerText = foo.innerText; <- why does this insert a ton of <br>s? :(
[06:53:29] <seutje> sry, add a [0] after that gebtn
[06:55:02] <exnihilo> zogot: I have pages that either return a snippet or a full page based on the headers, and when I hook into a href, it does set my back properly, but because I loaded a snippet, when I go back I just see a tiny snippet instead of the whole page
[06:56:00] <exnihilo> I just want to hook the back button to load the previous page snippet into my content area
[06:56:10] <exnihilo> and update the address
[06:57:10] <pissypaw> howdy
[06:59:06] <goshawk> hi
[06:59:18] <Cagelin> Hi guys. I'm trying to get the data from then 2nd <td> in my table, but the only thing I can access is the classname from the <tr>. How would I approach this problem with jQuery?
[06:59:26] <Cagelin> from the*
[06:59:49] <goshawk> what even should i bind for an html which is just displayed?
[06:59:50] <exnihilo> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ lots of ways to get at it
[07:00:37] <goshawk> i tried .load() and .ready() but they are too early
[07:01:12] <pissypaw> i like jQuery a lot. it's hot. it kind of clashes with PHP and Wordpress because it is so much more beautiful. what frameworks are you fellas in to? trying to learn some django at the moment. ruby seems a bit "on the decline". and node.js seems a bit immature. what do you build your sites on?
[07:01:48] <exnihilo> Django is training wheels... I'd go with flask.  It's active but doesn't get in your way
[07:02:00] <exnihilo> python/flask/sqlalchemy is a very solid stack of tools
[07:03:39] <pissypaw> cool
[07:03:55] <Mullie> thinkt4nk:  still there?
[07:03:58] <dax_roc> pissypaw: Depends on the use I guess, cakephp. django, twisted. It's more how much time you have to learn
[07:04:26] <is_null> hi all, is there any reason for which selector.live('click', callback) would not work when select.click(callback) DOES work ? its driving me crazy
[07:04:46] <dealt> hi
[07:05:01] <pissypaw> i don't know any python but want to get in to it. thought starting with a framework of some kind might be a good idea. i am basically looking for a wordpress replacement, but hopefully something more minimal.
[07:05:18] <Jon47> i wouldn't say ruby is on the decline
[07:05:19] <exnihilo> well... while cake php isn't bad itself, php is a pretty grotesque language.
[07:05:19] <dealt> i'm trying to submit a form with dynamically inserted elements, but the form don't include these new elements
[07:05:34] <Jon47> the community is very active and some of the best sites on the internet are written in it (github, for example)
[07:05:56] <dealt> most of the online stuff i found deals with live();
[07:06:06] <pissypaw> i hear symfony is the way to go with php. but alas, php is pretty gross.
[07:06:14] <dealt> but since 1.7 i think it was discouraged to use
[07:06:17] <Jon47> gross?
[07:06:20] <dax_roc> exnihilo: I wouldn't have much of a problem with php | bar it promotes bad programming skills
[07:06:58] <Jon47> php has given so much to the world
[07:07:01] <Jon47> and takes so much heat
[07:07:25] <dax_roc> Python forces you to think correctly, php assumes you have a brain ( and asumtions is the mother of all fuckups right )
[07:07:32] <dealt> any suggestions?
[07:07:33] <Jon47> people need to advocate the tools you love, but not disrespect the ones they've grown past
[07:07:35] <exnihilo> the main thing php got right is that it is easy for sysadmins to provide, and it is very easy for people to add libraries in userspace
[07:07:48] <exnihilo> thus sysadmins and hosted sites love it, and it is everywhere
[07:08:20] <dealt> can't help it, but its funny how people blame the tools for bad habits
[07:08:48] <Jon47> dealt +1
[07:08:50] <ajpiano> for real, just look at how many people are like JQUERY FORCES YOU TO NOT LEARN HOW TO CODE
[07:08:55] <dax_roc> dealt: if theres a wrong easy way people will use it
[07:09:31] <ajpiano> btw is_null and dealt if you want help providing a live demo to your issue where it fails is the most expedient method of doing so
[07:09:31] <exnihilo> well.  by that logic dax_roc, java would be the way to go, because it handcuffs you in so many ways to prevent programmer stupidity
[07:10:32] <exnihilo> I think python and ruby are both great choices, and clojure shows a lot of promise too.
[07:10:32] <pissypaw> just basic stuff in building templates with PHP i am frustrated by how inconsistent its functions feel. for example, explode(), you put the array in last, but in strlen() you put it in first. sometimes something is called some_thing() other things are something(). all seems a bit random. i keep having to look everything up in the manual because things aren't called what you'd intuitively think they were.
[07:10:51] <dax_roc> ajpiano: Doesn't it get you to follow a set model / syntax granted that syntax is extremly fluid ?
[07:11:10] <ajpiano> dax_roc: not really
[07:11:22] <dealt> dax_roc: though i do get your point. i regularly deal with co-php programmers who just didn't grow up.they just chose to code the way they coded 5 yrs ago. just sad
[07:11:35] <ajpiano> it dictates nothing about the structure and organisation of your app, it's a tool
[07:12:05] <dealt> php the language has matured thru the years, unfortunately some of its users didnt
[07:12:18] <exnihilo> well... I think some dictation of structure has a positive effect.  Just look at maven in the java world to see what I mean
[07:12:55] <dax_roc> dealt: I know, read a chapter in one book and decided they know how to program. I deal with that every day. the end result a nightmare database server battered by thousands of queries per second (impractical).
[07:13:08] <amon293> hey! i need help with registration, login forms and e-mail confirmation. How do i do this?
[07:13:50] <wojtek__> hi
[07:13:56] <ajpiano> dax_roc: yeah, but the problem is that then advanced users then blame the language/framework for allowing people like that to proliferate
[07:14:11] <ajpiano> instead of just accepting that when something has millions of users
[07:14:18] <ajpiano> there's going to be a broad swathe of ability
[07:14:33] <aaronmcadam> yea
[07:14:43] <aaronmcadam> I work with django and there's a hell of a lot of shit code in there
[07:14:51] <aaronmcadam> in the platform i mean
[07:15:06] <wojtek__> I store my data in an element with $("el").data(). Is there a way to get it once and then change it by reference or I have to save it always with $("el").data("foo", bar); ?
[07:15:21] <Iszak> ajpiano: do you like node.js?
[07:15:24] <exnihilo> yeah.  I hate django on a lot of levels, but it is great if all you want is a barebones admin interface and some very simple views
[07:15:36] <ajpiano> Iszak: yes
[07:15:38] <aaronmcadam> i'm talkin bout the platform we have that was written in it
[07:15:43] <Iszak> ajpiano: typical :P
[07:15:54] <aaronmcadam> it's a shame to see an elegant language written so horribly lol
[07:15:54] <ajpiano> Iszak: do you
[07:16:11] <mquasar> exit
[07:16:16] <ebwise> yii is a good php framework with a rails-feel
[07:16:18] <Iszak> ajpiano: It shows a lot of potential, and would like to use it in the future but it's too immature for me at the moment.
[07:16:35] <dealt> ajpiano: re: my question (dynamic elements in the form, not included on submit), do i need to post some snippet?
[07:16:47] <ajpiano> dealt: would help, yes
[07:16:50] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net
[07:17:20] <dax_roc> ajpiano: I wouldn't think so, I think it's the lazy|programmers fault. Languages/Frameworks will always lack it's how you choose to extend your skills. For me i'm always looking for a better solution.
[07:17:23] <dealt> ajpiano: ok, i'll try. my whole .js is quite long, i'm using backbone.js
[07:17:48] <ajpiano> dax_roc: well, go out on the internet and see how many people blame jquery or php or what have you for like, forcing the programmers to "be stupid"
[07:17:55] <ajpiano> dealt: build a minimal test case
[07:18:15] <dealt> ajpiano: ok
[07:18:37] <ajpiano> you might discover the issue in the process
[07:19:54] <aaronmcadam> yeaeh
[07:20:07] <aaronmcadam> so many times making a fiddle makes u realise it's something else that's causing the issue
[07:20:31] <wojtek__> anyone, please? :)
[07:21:15] <tom__> wojtek__: i am only aware of the save it again method of changing element data
[07:21:27] <dax_roc> ajpiano: I hear you. I find jquery great, refreshing view on it. node.js has me intersted but scared at the same time. I think it was coding horror that said any thing that can be written in javascript probably will, not because it's practical but because it can. ( the linux emulator springs to mind ) ?
[07:21:54] <aaronmcadam> dax_roc: there's loads of examples on that
[07:22:08] <aaronmcadam> synthesisers, pdf readers, etc etc
[07:22:38] <dax_roc> aaronmcadam: exactly but great techincal projects all the same
[07:22:42] <aaronmcadam> DailyJS is full of em
[07:22:46] <aaronmcadam> definately!
[07:22:49] <wojtek__> tom__: it is very inconvenient
[07:22:54] <aaronmcadam> amazing proof of concepts
[07:23:17] <tom__> wojtek__: perhaps so. but better than nothing
[07:23:25] <aaronmcadam> i think why not? it just shows the versatility of js really
[07:23:32] <tom__> perhaps you could use a system of custom events to do the save automatically
[07:23:48] <rodger_that> greetings &amp; salutations, forgive the intrusion, i require some assistance / nudge in the right direction with some jQuery ajax, i have an ajax request setup, with custom headers, in the API documentation they specify the following: "All API calls must include an HTTP Basic authentication header containing the public & private API keys for your account.", i have included the snippet over here: http://pastebin.com/9eDepxs1 , sadly i
[07:23:51] <dax_roc> aaronmcadam: I'm of the if not why not too
[07:23:51] <aaronmcadam> and changes some attitudes about js not being a "real language" wtf a real language is
[07:24:05] <Whirl3d> good mornin' all. Is there any problem assigning multiple .on handlers to the same element? Or, rather, can you add event handlers to the .on handler after it's been defined?
[07:24:25] <aaronmcadam> handlers should stack
[07:24:34] <midori> how to bind smooth scrolling with the navigation?
[07:24:39] <exnihilo> my main gripe about javascript is that development/test/etc environments just aren't very robust compared to other options.
[07:24:40] <aaronmcadam> though I'm not too pushed on doing that
[07:24:46] <midori> http://www.joomlart.com/demo/#templates.joomlart.com/ja_cloris its example
[07:24:49] <ajpiano> wojtek__: it appears to work http://jsbin.com/ukusam/edit#javascript,html
[07:24:54] <wojtek__> tom__: what a sec cuz doc mention this issue: Using the object directly to get or set values is faster than making individual calls to .data() to get or set each value. Maybe because I was fetching "named" data via $("el").data("data");
[07:25:03] <aaronmcadam> exnihilo: that's true but you get to use your own toolchain
[07:25:06] <ajpiano> wojtek__: it's a lot easier to quickly test stuff like that yourself than ask here
[07:25:13] <midori> give me a link to the example
[07:25:15] <aaronmcadam> cloud9 is a good solution tho, try it
[07:25:33] <wojtek__> ajpiano: thanks :) look above, please :)
[07:25:52] <luite> my main gripe about javascript is that everything breaks if you change things in a big project :p
[07:26:01] <ajpiano> wojtek__: typically using $.data( DOMElement, "foo", "bar") is faster than the $.fn flavour
[07:26:13] <ajpiano> but either way, it's unlikely $.fn.data is a perf bottleneck for your app
[07:26:13] <Whirl3d> luite, not if you program it right from the get-go.
[07:26:34] <aaronmcadam> it's all about taking the time to structure the app first
[07:26:40] <luite> Whirl3d: what is "right" if your requirements keep changing?
[07:26:41] <aaronmcadam> instead of doc.readys all over the place
[07:26:57] <aaronmcadam> luite you use a modular approach that's how
[07:27:09] <Whirl3d> luite, a modular approach to development sounds like it would be suited to your tasks.
[07:27:24] <Whirl3d> Then you can add/remove/update modules without breaking "the big project"
[07:27:38] <jds> I recently saw a js presentation (maybe on Slideshare?) talking about refactoring js in stages, and sneaking it past the customer.  I can't find it anymore - any suggestions what it was?
[07:27:40] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d, luite: http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture
[07:28:01] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, amen!
[07:28:04] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[07:28:16] <midori> any help me?
[07:28:26] <crab> ajpiano: is it faster only because you don't construct an object out of the dom element first?
[07:29:11] <Whirl3d> midori, you need to look for a jquery plugin that handles smooth scrolling the way you would like.
[07:29:45] <ajpiano> crab: that's part of it, but even with a cached ref
[07:29:55] <exnihilo> aaronmcadam, thanks for the heads up on cloud9, it looks very interesting
[07:30:10] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: http://rmurphey.com/blog/2011/07/06/lessons-from-a-rewrite/
[07:30:28] <aaronmcadam> the idea is to not build a "big project" in the first place :)
[07:30:36] <aaronmcadam> exnihilo: it's awesome
[07:31:05] <midori> Whirl3d I know how to implement smooth scrolling, I want to understand how to connect the area with the active menu item
[07:31:38] <aaronmcadam> The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break up your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application. - Justin Meyer
[07:32:09] <Muimi> What's 'innerHTML'?
[07:32:24] <Whirl3d> My big problem: granularity.
[07:32:32] <aaronmcadam> midori: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/scroll-linked-navigation/
[07:32:39] <tom__> for a plugin that optionally allows the user to delegant events, is this a reasonable template: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/515780/
[07:32:40] <tom__> ?
[07:32:43] <Whirl3d> ?.scrollTo@midori
[07:32:49] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: mine is API usability and method naming
[07:32:56] <Whirl3d> doh! no bot-T? drats.
[07:32:58] <Mullie> If I selects by ID like jQuery('#commentform').bind("submit", function() { does it just get one form then?
[07:32:59] <dax_roc> Muimi: "<td>It's me innerHTML<b>More</b></td>"
[07:33:11] <Muimi> is more innerHTML?
[07:33:15] <Muimi> or is <b>
[07:33:26] <ajpiano> they both are
[07:33:30] <aaronmcadam> Mullie: yeah, an id should be unique, hence one
[07:33:44] <cdaven> Any effects.js devs here? I think there may be a bug here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L230
[07:33:50] <dax_roc> Muimi: the html / text content contained in the selector I think
[07:34:02] <Whirl3d> midori, check out .scrollTo plugin. It might help. Otherwise, you are gonna have to show some code and explain what you are looking for
[07:34:14] <luite> aaronmcadam: ah I quickly read that presentation, tnx. some things don't look realistic though, only the application "core" should know that you're using jquery, really?
[07:34:18] <ajpiano> cdaven: if there's a bug, what you want to do is file a ticket on http://bugs.jquery.com
[07:34:19] <Mullie> aaronmcadam: so if I change to select by class it will work not on just the first form on page?
[07:34:44] <LoreVTEC> hi guys. i have click event listeners both on body and on other elements, but i dont want the body click to fire if i click on the other elements
[07:34:52] <aaronmcadam> luite: you don't habe to follow it religiously, but yeah it makes sense
[07:34:57] <aaronmcadam> s/b/v
[07:35:17] <Muimi> huh?
[07:35:29] <jds> Hurrah!  http://www.slideshare.net/garann/sneaking-structure-into-your-dombased-application
[07:35:31] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ Mullie
[07:35:35] <aaronmcadam> feck
[07:35:36] <jds> Took me forever to find that...
[07:35:48] <diverdud`> How can i convert an ascii code to a character?
[07:36:20] <Whirl3d> LoreVTEC, try e.preventDefault() or return false in your elemen click handler. Or use the .on delegation method....
[07:36:23] <midori> Whirl3d try to scroll with your mouse and you will see how active the menu varies from region to region
[07:36:44] <dax_roc> Muimi: $('#selector').innerHTML() will give you the contents (text and or html) of the selected container
[07:36:56] <midori> Whirl3d sorry for bad english
[07:37:04] <LoreVTEC> ok thanks, ill try that. i was using e.stopProgation but it was giving me problems with jquery mobile
[07:37:08] <Whirl3d> midori, you got a link for me?
[07:37:52] <midori> Whirl3d http://www.joomlart.com/demo/#templates.joomlart.com/ja_cloris
[07:37:53] <aaronmcadam> it's not a great idea to use return false instead of stopProp
[07:38:11] <aaronmcadam> cuz if any errors happen they'll be masked
[07:38:48] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: There's no problem with e.preventDefault with jqm, it must be something else
[07:39:02] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: like if you turn off ajax for forms, etc
[07:39:07] <Whirl3d> midori, you setup a scroll event handler that determines the top of each menu section and the top position of the main content.
[07:39:32] <Whirl3d> midori, if the section's top is visible, change to that section...roughly
[07:39:35] <aaronmcadam> midori did u look at that video tutorial
[07:39:47] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d, midori: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/scroll-linked-navigation/
[07:40:05] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, are you a bot? LOL
[07:40:19] <aaronmcadam> a very sexy one at that
[07:40:20] <luite> aaronmcadam: what I meant though was that javascript doesn't exactly help you cope with changes in api functions (for the modules, core, whathever), especially the "flexible" way of communicating with libraries, encouraged by jquery/jquery-ui through configuration objects, where fields kan often have multiple types, be optional etc, dependencies between fields can change.
[07:40:33] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, or just a veritable cornucopia of reference urls?
[07:40:37] <LoreVTEC> aaronmcadam: it's e.stopPropagation thats giving me problem with jqm
[07:40:41] <luite> it's often difficult to find what needs to be changed, at least without extensive testing
[07:40:51] <LoreVTEC> it makes my transitions blink
[07:40:53] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: please file an issue at github
[07:41:13] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: you may be trying to do too much between pages
[07:41:25] <midori> aaronmcadam Whirl3d this is what I need
[07:41:25] <aaronmcadam> luite: well yeah u need good coverage with any language
[07:41:32] <midori> thanks!
[07:41:40] <aaronmcadam> midori: I know, that's why i pasted it to u a few mins ago
[07:41:42] <aaronmcadam> :D
[07:42:11] <LoreVTEC> aaronmcadam: is that a common cause for blink transitions?
[07:42:37] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: could be, you might wanna use a callback and then transition when you're function is done
[07:42:53] <aaronmcadam> also what platform are u on
[07:43:11] <LoreVTEC> ipad
[07:43:24] <LoreVTEC> also happens on a mac
[07:43:30] <luite> aaronmcadam: can't deny that, but say you had better algebraic datatypes and you use those to pass configuration options, then you can probably eliminate at least 90% of invalid arguments without even writing a single unit test
[07:43:53] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, love the face that the jquery for designers main content is flash-based. ironic.
[07:43:58] <Whirl3d> *fact
[07:44:25] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[07:44:43] <aaronmcadam> where do u see flash?
[07:44:59] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, that's the first thing on the page you just linked.
[07:45:10] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[07:45:20] <aaronmcadam> it's a bloody video
[07:45:25] <aaronmcadam> what else is gonna be
[07:45:25] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:45:50] <thebignoise> $('.sug_res').text().substring(0, bold).css('color','red');
[07:45:52] <thebignoise> is there an easy way to do something like this?
[07:46:08] <aaronmcadam> what are u doing?
[07:46:37] <aaronmcadam> set a substring's css with the text?
[07:46:54] <aaronmcadam> within*
[07:46:56] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yea im trying to color part of the string
[07:47:00] <thebignoise> yes
[07:47:03] <thebignoise> exactly
[07:47:20] <aaronmcadam> well for a start I'd use addClass
[07:47:41] <aaronmcadam> but thinkin of a way to target the text
[07:48:00] <thebignoise> ohhh yea thats a good idea. ill just wrap the substring in a div with that class
[07:48:12] <aaronmcadam> or just a span
[07:48:13] <thebignoise> and keep updating it
[07:48:16] <thebignoise> right yea
[07:48:18] <aaronmcadam> you don't want a div
[07:48:19] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:48:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's the easiest and less overhead
[07:49:22] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yuppers. thanks
[07:49:32] <aaronmcadam> np
[07:57:56] <LoreVTEC> Whirl3d: return false solves the problem on the desktop but doesnt do anything on ipad
[07:58:33] <tp43> I think browsers should start including jquery like they do javascript
[07:58:50] <aaronmcadam> somebody else said that
[07:58:55] <aaronmcadam> I don't agree with it
[07:59:19] <aaronmcadam> if browsers start going into bundling userland libs
[07:59:32] <Whirl3d> LoreVTEC, check out http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:59:52] <LoreVTEC> is it ok to use jquery 1.7 with jqm?
[07:59:53] <aaronmcadam> it's hard enough getting people to upgrade browsers, nevermind another strand of releases to worry about
[08:00:03] <Whirl3d> oh, I dunno
[08:00:08] <aaronmcadam> LoreVTEC: I've used it without problems at all, tho it's not officially supported yet
[08:00:08] <LoreVTEC> i read it isnt officially supported
[08:00:17] <LoreVTEC> ah ok thanks
[08:00:29] <aaronmcadam> yerp
[08:00:47] <aaronmcadam> tho I'm using backbone for the vast majority of the app
[08:00:59] <aaronmcadam> jquery only really used for ajax and helper funcs
[08:01:16] <ebwise> better than browsers bundling jquery, just use a CDN; with enough adoption the lib is likely to be precached
[08:01:21] <aaronmcadam> so I can't say if the new $.fn.on API will work properly or anything
[08:01:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah browsers shouldn't be making decisions like that
[08:01:59] <aaronmcadam> they've got enough to be doing making their VMs awesome
[08:02:42] <ebwise> although, kindle's silk is interesting/different because their proxy sends prerendered content to the client(s)
[08:02:54] <carnau> Hi, I trying to call a function passing an object, but I don't know why inside the function this object parsed to JSON is empty. I'm just calling like that: "Drupal.drupalchat.processChatDataNodejs(jQuery.parseJSON(message.data));". My code is here: http://pastebin.com/zwrTWppr
[08:03:21] <carnau> maybe it's a syntax error or whatever. I can't understand it.
[08:03:23] <aaronmcadam> ebwise: opera mobile does that too
[08:03:42] <aaronmcadam> ebwise: though really messily, it adds event handlers n everything inline on each element
[08:04:00] <aaronmcadam> things like SSL are non existent too
[08:04:56] <ebwise> <3 opera
[08:06:03] <aaronmcadam> Bruce Lawson is a fuckin legend
[08:06:15] <aaronmcadam> but opera mobile sucks :D
[08:10:42] <ebwise> opera is like the precocious kid down the block you don't really like but can't help but be nice to
[08:11:28] <aaronmcadam> I might have another look cuz of DragonFly
[08:11:38] <aaronmcadam> I have it installed but haven't really looked at it
[08:14:38] <thebignoise> does anyone in here know how to hide the history box that drops down when you start add text in an input box
[08:15:07] <aaronmcadam> autocomplete attr
[08:15:13] <aaronmcadam> on input
[08:15:16] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yea i did that
[08:15:22] <thebignoise> but then it does this ...
[08:15:45] <aaronmcadam> what
[08:15:57] <thebignoise> http://cl.ly/1M0T1D0R1f3z3c2z3p0q
[08:16:20] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[08:16:26] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: haha yea ik
[08:16:30] <aaronmcadam> what browser is that
[08:16:57] <aaronmcadam> sexy input tho hehe
[08:17:10] <thebignoise> lol thanx
[08:17:34] <aaronmcadam> you're showing autocompletions yourself aren't u
[08:17:43] <aaronmcadam> which browser are u on
[08:18:29] <thebignoise> right yup
[08:18:31] <thebignoise> chrome
[08:18:43] <aaronmcadam> try jqui's autocomplete demo
[08:19:15] <aaronmcadam> examine how they hide it
[08:20:01] <aaronmcadam> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[08:20:17] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: okay sounds good thanx
[08:20:21] <thebignoise> again... :)
[08:20:27] <aaronmcadam> doesn't happen on that demo
[08:20:53] <LoreVTEC> Whirl3d: im looking at the on method, but i dont see a difference in the way the event bubbles up the dom
[08:21:05] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't
[08:21:15] <aaronmcadam> well, it's different
[08:21:25] <aaronmcadam> on is delegation, normal clicks are propagation
[08:22:00] <aaronmcadam> instead of binding to the element itself, u give it contextual dom nodes to bind to
[08:22:03] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: role="textbox"
[08:22:06] <aaronmcadam> ooh
[08:22:09] <aaronmcadam> really?
[08:22:25] <aaronmcadam> <input id="tags" class="ui-autocomplete-input" autocomplete="off" role="textbox" aria-autocomplete="list" aria-haspopup="true">
[08:22:41] <Whirl3d> deferred's are used for asynchronous communication, right?
[08:22:46] <LoreVTEC> im doing $('body').on('click', '.arrow-next', goToNextPage);
[08:23:07] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yuppers
[08:23:25] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: no, any asyc long running action
[08:23:34] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: like an ajax request or an animation
[08:23:41] <thebignoise> i didnt even know role was an attr of input
[08:23:43] <Whirl3d> what about a form for validation purposes?
[08:23:56] <Whirl3d> where the required fields return promises to be valid
[08:24:11] <aaronmcadam> hmm right
[08:24:14] <aaronmcadam> you could do that yea
[08:24:43] <Whirl3d> then it could stop the need to check the form every time a field was updated.
[08:25:02] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: https://gist.github.com/1321768
[08:25:18] <aaronmcadam> it was already resolved u mean?
[08:25:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[08:26:02] <aaronmcadam> instead of validating the whole form each time?
[08:26:08] <Cryp71c> I'm using .click() to fire a checkbox's onclick event (I want it to check the box as if the user is clicking on it, then fire the onclick event), however it seems to click the box, but not fire the onclick event (or, if the onclick event is fired, its being fired BEFORE the box is checked)
[08:26:13] <faraway> does anyone know how the query plugin is called where i can create a callback for a selector that is called every time an element matching this selector was added or removed form the document ?
[08:26:20] <Cryp71c> Anyone guide me on doing this properly or in a different way?
[08:26:52] <aaronmcadam> faraway just use pubsub
[08:27:01] <aaronmcadam> faraway: https://gist.github.com/1321768
[08:27:19] <aaronmcadam> don't use the old plugin, it's awful how it works
[08:30:56] <techouse> how do i apply a function to an element?
[08:31:18] <techouse> $.('mydiv').each(function() { tralala });?
[08:31:54] <aaronmcadam> techouse: what do u mean
[08:32:12] <aaronmcadam> techouse: what sort of function
[08:32:36] <alvincrespo> techouse: bind()
[08:32:47] <faraway> aaronmcadam: hmm .. i'm probably to stupid to find the thing i require on the page :D or i explained it wrong
[08:32:58] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[08:33:00] <alvincrespo> techouse: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[08:33:04] <techouse> k
[08:33:05] <aaronmcadam> oh k
[08:33:06] <techouse> tnx!
[08:33:07] <techouse> :)
[08:33:11] <aaronmcadam> it's not hard to do faraway
[08:33:24] <aaronmcadam> in the func that adds your elements, publish a topic
[08:33:41] <techouse> yea, well i got to apply .css, but i have to assign some if statement and i rather make a function than a million ifs
[08:33:48] <aaronmcadam> faraway: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/loose-coupling-with-the-pubsub-plugin/
[08:33:51] <alvincrespo> techouse: Sorry I forgot, you should probably use .on() not .bind()
[08:33:56] <techouse> on
[08:33:57] <techouse> ok
[08:34:07] <aaronmcadam> that's for events
[08:34:17] <alvincrespo> techouse: that bit of information .on v. bind is in the documentation for your reference as to "why?"
[08:34:27] <aaronmcadam> not for arbitrarily calling functions on elements
[08:34:28] <techouse> k
[08:34:44] <LoreVTEC> aaronmcadam: could you please have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/LmT4j/1/
[08:35:10] <LoreVTEC> there is something im not getting for this propagation stuff...
[08:35:19] <aaronmcadam> i gtg in a min
[08:35:32] <aaronmcadam> there's plenty of blog posts about it
[08:36:55] <LoreVTEC> ok ill keep looking, thanks for your help anyway!
[08:37:21] <faraway> aaronmcadam: hmm, i see how i could solve it with this â¦ but i hoped there would be a way like this $(".a-class").on("remove",callback) , $(".a-class").on("append",callback)   but anyway â¦ it's an interesting plugin
[08:40:32] <khmer> faraway: think about the model of DOM events--that would require a lot of listening for the dom changing at all. not all browsers have support for DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument
[08:44:37] <aaronmcadam> faraway yeah but the way that old plugin works is very inefficent and a massive hack
[08:44:45] <techouse> alvincrespo: just gave it some thought and found out that i better declare my custom function and then use $.('mydiv').customFunction();
[08:44:54] <aaronmcadam> khmer++
[08:45:21] <aaronmcadam> pubsub solves the problem is a really nice way
[08:46:01] <alvincrespo> techouse: yeah, you can do it that way as well.
[08:49:14] <Matias_> How can I create a div to be draggable but just inside its parent div?
[08:49:58] <finlay> is there a shortcut for finding children? or do I need to chain multiple .find() together?
[08:50:15] <finlay> ie: $('#blah').find('div').find('a')
[08:50:31] <Matias_> .filter
[08:50:56] <subdesign> Matias_, http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement
[08:52:20] <Matias_> thank you subdesign
[08:57:52] <diverdud`> Is it possible to catch the event that a user click on a button with a mouse and holds the mousebutton down, and in return act with a lot of repeated click events until the mouse button is released again?
[09:00:58] <amon293> how can i get invited to a channel?
[09:01:12] <snover> if you have to askâ¦
[09:01:53] <pootpoot> you have to prove your worth in a test
[09:02:18] <Whirl3d> it helps to have the decoder ring too
[09:05:35] <is_null> ajpiano: sure: http://foo.art.yourlabs.org/admin/art/artwork/add/ user/pass: test/test the problem is a the very bottom of this page, in links like "Add another Image", pasting "$('.add-row a').live('click', function(e) { alert('hello'); }); in the console works, but it is not effective in http://foo.art.yourlabs.org/admin_hack/js/
[09:07:46] <Lichurec> Hi
[09:08:47] <Lichurec> it's either me, or jQuery sometimes behaves in totally unpredictable mannerâ¦ can ANYONE explain to me why does jQuery loose the object-var assignment here? http://jsfiddle.net/lichurec/5HNLS/
[09:09:18] <Websteria> Ok, can anyone here help me with a widget mousedown handler question?
[09:09:58] <Websteria> Basically I'm creating an element in a widget and the mousedown element does fire, but then  I have no way to get a reference back to the widget which called it....
[09:10:22] <clockwize> Lichurec: explain .. I don't understand what you mean by object-var assignment?
[09:10:25] <quicksilver> Lichurec: wrap takes a copy of the wrapper and wraps it around each element.
[09:10:38] <quicksilver> Lichurec: so your var "wrapper" is quite valid
[09:10:49] <thebigno_> it is possible to 'click' an input box when the page loads so you can immediately type in it
[09:10:52] <quicksilver> Lichurec: btu it refers to a DOM object which is not actually attached to the document anywhere
[09:10:58] <clockwize> oh I see.. yeah, wrapper (as in your variable) isn't in the doc
[09:11:04] <Lichurec> Websteria: http://api.jquery.com/event.target/ ?
[09:11:08] <thebigno_> i tried focus, click, select on the input but nothing
[09:11:15] <quicksilver> "A copy of this structure will be wrapped around" (from the docs)
[09:11:33] <ericandrewlewis> does jquery .animate work well transitioning from one gradient background to another?
[09:12:08] <Websteria> target returns the element which was clicked
[09:12:11] <Lichurec> quicksilver: och, christ :/  but WHY does it make a copy?
[09:12:23] <Websteria> I need a reference back to the widget instance which this object is part of
[09:12:26] <quicksilver> Lichurec: because, in general, it's apply it to more than one element.
[09:12:41] <quicksilver> Lichurec: so it needs a separate copy for each
[09:13:24] <clockwize> jQuery objects follow the composite pattern, if you call wrap on a $(".foo") and there were 5 .foo elements, it'd need to wrap each one seperatly...
[09:13:43] <Lichurec> quicksilver: christ :/
[09:14:23] <Lichurec> may I simply ask - what for?
[09:17:37] <finlay> is there something magical about prefixing a variable with $? eg: var $tabs = $('#mytabs');
[09:17:49] <Lichurec> ok - different question; I need a reference to a object, that's created on JS side and wraps another object and the pass the reference further
[09:17:54] <Lichurec> how to do that then?
[09:18:01] <Websteria> So no one else has any good answers for me?
[09:18:04] <Websteria> Basically I'm creating an element in a widget and the mousedown element does fire, but then  I have no way to get a reference back to the widget which called it....
[09:18:08] <Lichurec> finlay: it's a matter of coding style / pattern
[09:18:09] <wojtek__> I keep setInterval id in element's data and run several carousels on a page and it seems set interva is not synchronized. How come?
[09:18:22] <finlay> Lichurec: okay so just part of the var name, thanks.
[09:19:15] <Lichurec> finlay: yes; in most cases it it says to you that this is a jQuery object (hence jQ does not extend each and every object on it's own)
[09:20:01] <Lichurec> wojtek__:  show / explain?
[09:21:05] <wojtek__> Lichurec: wait a sec, I'm uploading it
[09:21:31] <wojtek__> btw. I saw your nick somewhere in Polish web :D
[09:22:06] <Lichurec> wojtek__: probablyâ¦ I'm "on tah internetz" hence like 1997 or sth, soâ¦
[09:22:28] <wojtek__> Lichurec: maybe osnews?
[09:23:18] <Lichurec> wojtek__: doubt it. Old (and I mean OLD) MozillaPL.org (if we're looking on FLOSS environment)
[09:24:03] <wojtek__> Lichurec: ok, take a look: http://ryrych.pl/null/multi/documentation/examples/example_multi.html
[09:24:08] <Mkop> would there likely be a performance difference between the two code samples in http://pastebin.com/PLpqRtGf ?
[09:25:05] <wojtek__> Lichurec: it is working here:http://ryrych.github.com/rcarousel/examples/example_multi.html
[09:25:54] <Lichurec> Mkop: performance - nope;
[09:26:16] <wojtek__> Lichurec: I don't know why they don't run in the same interval
[09:26:16] <Mkop> what about if I declare the function in multiple handlers?
[09:26:28] <Mkop> that same line of code is being attached to several things
[09:26:46] <wojtek__> Lichurec: it seems that every carousel has its own data so ?
[09:27:43] <Lichurec> Mkop:  exactly; but what kind of performance issues would you expect on a thing like this
[09:27:46] <Mkop> how about $("....").blur(some_func); $("....").change(some_func) vs. $("...").bind('change blur',some_func)
[09:28:11] <Mkop> I just discovered that attaching event handlers takes 1500 ms in IE7
[09:28:25] <wojtek__> Lichurec: and every's carousel's setinterval id is also unique
[09:28:31] <Mkop> so I'm trying to speed that up
[09:29:02] <Mkop> one thing that I'm doing is attaching to "table.form_defintion select" instead of ".form_definition select"
[09:29:35] <Mkop> would it help to provide the path to the select? "table.form_definition>tr>td>select"?
[09:30:39] <Matias_> is there any way to do something like .appendTo(newParent) but to specify the exact position in which it has to appear?
[09:31:04] <pyparadigm> Is there really any reason you have to wrap JSON keys in quotes anymore? I notice a lot of examples on jQuery's site don't?
[09:31:33] <polygon-pusher> can jq animate the image of a background-image?
[09:31:42] <snover> pyparadigm: there is a difference between an object in JavaScript and JSON
[09:31:49] <snover> JSON *requires* quoted keys.
[09:32:05] <snover> it is a strict subset of JavaScript.
[09:32:24] <Matias_> I'm talking about something like w.appendTo(newParent); w.css({top: 50, left:20}), but I'm sure there should be an operation to do that
[09:34:35] <pyparadigm> snover, I guess I'll just always use quotes then
[09:36:40] <Lichurec> Matias_: you want to position the element absolutely within it's parent?
[09:37:10] <Matias_> actually it'll be a draggable element and it won't be able to go outside the parent body
[09:37:32] <Matias_> Lichurec, but yes, it'll be absolute relative to the parent :P
[09:37:56] <Lichurec> you can simply set the style attributes as you mentioned before
[09:38:49] <Matias_> alright, that's what I'm already doing but I thought there was another way
[09:39:57] <diverdud`> is there a way to say "is x a member of the array a" where a is some array of numbers?
[09:43:20] <pootpoot> diverdud`: inArray?
[09:43:40] <chrisvwebdev> hi!   i have an issue with form.submit(); in ie9.  it doesn't work.  anyone have this issue before?
[09:43:57] <diverdud`> pootpoot: thx
[09:47:42] <thebigno_> can you 'disable the keyboard' with jquery
[09:47:44] <thebigno_> ?
[09:48:05] <Lichurec> Matias_: you can also use Offset http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[09:48:16] <Lichurec> i thinkâ¦
[09:49:19] <Lichurec> uhm, nope :/ that's still relative to the document.
[09:50:56] <diverdud`> why does parseInt("039") give 0 ? It should give 39??
[09:51:42] <orentanay> does anyone know if there is an updated version of Dave Cardwell's jQMinMax? I'm using jq1.6.4, and it's not at all compatible. thanks.
[09:52:04] <pootpoot> diverdud`: mine returns 3
[09:52:40] <diverdud`> pootpoot: even more strange
[09:53:48] <Lichurec> orentanay: If the input string begins with "0", radix is eight (octal). This feature is non-standard, and some implementations deliberately do not support it (instead using the radix 10).Â  For this reason always specify a radix when using parseInt.
[09:54:03] <Lichurec> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[09:54:20] <orentanay> thanks
[09:55:23] <zeejy> Hey, wondering if anyone can help me solve a sortable problem with overflowing DIVs. I have sortable lists within different overflowing DIVs, all contained within a parent DIV that is also overflowing. But the problem is dragging an item down to the bottom of the parent DIV isn't auto scrolling because of positioning. Quick image I made to illustrate: http://skitch.com/zkoch/gpn12/sortable-problem
[09:55:23] <zeejy> Any thoughts?
[09:58:30] <Lichurec> was noce, but TTGH ;)
[09:58:37] <zeejy> Anyone? I have no idea how to solve :/
[09:58:40] <Lichurec> have fun, kids!
[09:59:10] <Lichurec> zeejy: doa jsfiddle sample with a code;
[10:07:55] <dogarrhea2> hello.  is there a way to register event listeners only on the nontransparent parts of a graphic?
[10:08:19] <Sazpaimon> Im trying to have a column of checkboxes that behave like radios, in that only one can be selected at a time
[10:11:10] <zeejy> Okay, I've created a JSFiddle of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/P9FBm/9/
[10:11:35] <zeejy> Multiple overflowing DIVs that contain sortable lists contained within an overflowing parent
[10:11:42] <mansoor-s> dogarrhea2, what kind of event listener? i know of a trick but only works with click event
[10:11:45] <zeejy> If you drag a list item, you see that it won't auto scroll the parent div
[10:12:15] <dogarrhea2> mansoor-s, i have an image. on top of another image.  as you may know, everything in html/css is a box. a freaking box.
[10:12:17] <mansoor-s> dogarrhea2, or should work with any mouse-down based event
[10:12:44] <dogarrhea2> if i click a transparent part of the image, the click should go "through" to the image behind it (if that part is also not transparent)
[10:13:54] <zeejy> @dogarrhea2 Hm..This wouldn't be optimal I don't think. But you could capture the click event and then use the position of the mouse to determine if it's within the bounds of the transparent part or not...
[10:14:12] <dogarrhea2> yea that seems like the only way
[10:14:35] <dogarrhea2> and somehow make the thing with a higher z value a child of the thing it's on top of
[10:14:40] <dogarrhea2> hacks hacks
[10:14:48] <zeejy> :)
[10:15:50] <dogarrhea2> ball shaped objects don't block out cylinder shaped frustums. they block out rectangular prism frustums hurray
[10:15:51] <mansoor-s> dogarrhea2, you will need to build a pixel map of the image - using imageData from canvas and on every click you will have to check which pixel was clicked and if it was a transparent one then you don't do anything and pass the event on
[10:16:10] <dogarrhea2> yea i'm looking at the w3 schools thing
[10:16:29] <dogarrhea2> i see a circle and a square. will this be a huge pain in the anus for something shaped like a porcupine
[10:16:32] <Mkop> so weird
[10:16:36] <Mkop> this one line of code takes 150 ms
[10:16:46] <Mkop> $("div.mainForm").delegate("select.correlate_base","change",rebuild_crosstabs);
[10:17:07] <Mkop> (in IE7)
[10:18:21] <zeejy> @Mkop What is taking long? Is it the rebuid_crosstabs function?
[10:18:46] <Mkop> it shouldn't even be calling rebuild_crosstabs at this point
[10:19:06] <dogarrhea2> http://www.image-maps.com/  ok maybe this will work
[10:19:06] <Mkop> also, the first line of rebuild_crosstabs is "return true;" ;-)
[10:19:35] <hs2> Any one know why this wouldn't work in ie8? jQuery('#fxg_start_btn,#fxg_return_to_project').click(function(e){ .. for this HTML <button class="button-dark btn-personalize" id="fxg_start_btn"><span><span>Personalize</span></span></button>
[10:20:43] <mansoor-s> dogarrhea2, if you have access to canvas, take a look at this http://pastie.org/2956130   code is from a presentation i saw somewhere
[10:22:07] <dogarrhea2> what kind of canvas?
[10:22:15] <zeejy> @Mkop How many items are you binding to there with select.correlate_base?
[10:22:22] <mansoor-s> dogarrhea2, Canvas element
[10:22:50] <mansoor-s> the html5 element
[10:22:56] <Mkop> zeejy: 4. but should that even make a difference with .delegate?
[10:24:19] <zeejy> @Mkop I don't think so, but I'm not exactly sure how the delegate() method works. Any reason you're not using on() instead?
[10:24:45] <Mkop> because I'm using 1.6.4. If there's a reason to upgrade to 1.7 I can definitely do that
[10:25:31] <zeejy> It might be worth giving it a quick try.
[10:25:40] <hs2> Any one know why this wouldn't work in ie8? jQuery('#fxg_start_btn,#fxg_return_to_project').click(function(e){ .. for this HTML <button class="button-dark btn-personalize" id="fxg_start_btn"><span><span>Personalize</span></span></button>
[10:26:53] <chovy> hi
[10:27:44] <dogarrhea2> what would i use to check the transparency/alpha value of a given pixel
[10:27:50] <dogarrhea2> on a click
[10:28:11] <chovy> if i use $.ajax({ async: false}); and have my success function set a global that is used by another function defined below $.ajax() call -- will it wait? Or does it still behave like I forked when the ajax request is made. The problem is my $.each() below the $.ajax() appears to not have the global varaible defined yet.
[10:28:31] <chovy> even when using async false.
[10:29:06] <thinkclay> how would one bind scripts that are loaded dynamically?
[10:29:18] <thinkclay> specifically that effect DOm
[10:29:23] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Pretty sure you can't get that information
[10:29:31] <dogarrhea2> yea. was reading that now
[10:29:42] <dogarrhea2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1936021/javascript-eyedropper-tell-colour-of-pixel-under-mouse-cursor
[10:32:26] <djQuery> anyone working with kendoui? it appears that the refresh of the grid isnt working.
[10:32:46] <antnash> Hey guys. I want to have multiple divs on a page that refresh after differing periods of time. Could anyone point me in the right direction?
[10:32:58] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ohumul/4/edit
[10:33:55] <diverdud`> is there a way to check if a js file has been loaded already in jquery?
[10:34:12] <djQuery> antnash: whats the issue if they are refreshing it would seem that it is working
[10:34:56] <antnash> djQuery, my problem is that I don't know where to start with it
[10:35:13] <dogarrhea2> for an <area> tag, can you assign an event listener?
[10:35:38] <djQuery> Mkop: think 1.71 is faster than 1.6.4 for one. also bug fixes
[10:36:02] <thinkclay> if i load a block dynamically into my view and that block contains JS, how can i load / activate that JS?
[10:36:19] <fourcolors> hi, Is there a way to trigger an event in jQuery before a page is reloaded in anyway?
[10:36:38] <fourcolors> I'm trying to check dirty forms
[10:38:16] <djQuery> ?.ajax@antnash
[10:41:24] <antnash> djQuery, so I can't use a single function with setTimeout() in it to handle the refreshes of different divs at different times?
[10:41:41] <djQuery> antnash sure you could.
[10:42:22] <Sazpaimon> weird, removeAttr('checked') isnt working
[10:42:31] <antnash> djquery, Would you be able to point me towards an answer, matey?
[10:42:45] <Sazpaimon> it alters the DOM, but the checkbox remains checked..
[10:43:04] <miketaylr> .prop('checked', false)?
[10:43:13] <djQuery> you just need to layout the structure correctly.   <div class="refreshingdiv" id="content1" data-url="refresh.php" data-interval="60000">Default Content</div>
[10:43:32] <djQuery> then loop through each one and do a setTimeout()
[10:44:09] <djQuery> you might want to look at this instead of setTimeout http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[10:44:18] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/2h8HP/  no circle showing up :(
[10:44:26] <Sazpaimon> miketaylr, that works, thanks
[10:44:29] <diverdud`> yepnope
[10:44:44] <Sazpaimon> is that just a shortcut for doing something like .each(function() { this.checked = false; })
[10:45:11] <dogarrhea2> woos need a widht and ehight
[10:45:16] <diverdud`> Sazpaimon: use html5 to draw circle
[10:45:20] <miketaylr> Sazpaimon: essentially
[10:45:40] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: use html5 to draw circle
[10:45:55] <dogarrhea2> can't do html5 ..
[10:46:07] <zeejy> Anyone have any thoughts for how to solve the problem where you can't drag list items down in teh parent DIV when using sortable: http://jsfiddle.net/srrqU/1/
[10:46:07] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: why
[10:46:12] <dogarrhea2> why is everyone suggesting html5... i need backwards compatability
[10:46:18] <dogarrhea2> i'm not just going to adopt some incomplete standard
[10:46:26] <dogarrhea2> just because it's new
[10:46:27] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: html5 has backwards compatibility
[10:46:45] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: get real
[10:46:52] <miketaylr> dogarrhea2: use html2
[10:46:54] <miketaylr> way safer
[10:47:08] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: use gopher
[10:47:45] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: gopher is much safer
[10:47:49] <jmqq> In javascript, if I want to test if foo==4 or foo==7 or foo==11, can do this similar to python, something like foo in [4,7,11] ?
[10:47:54] <antnash> cheers djQuery, I'll have a look through that
[10:48:23] <zeejy> @jmqq Not by default in the language, no
[10:48:28] <thinkclay> does .load() evaluate and apply <scripts> and if so, how can you update/execute DOM bindings?
[10:48:51] <jmqq> @zeejy: the most elegant way to do it is foo==4 || foo==7 || foo==11 ?
[10:49:07] <djQuery> dogarrhea2: there are plenty of ways to get backwards compatability AND use html5
[10:49:24] <dogarrhea2> basically, code twice.
[10:49:25] <djQuery> dogarrhea2: do a google for html5 shim
[10:49:28] <zeejy> Or use a library like underscore which has methods like _.indexOf[]
[10:49:32] <dogarrhea2> "progressive enhancment" is what htey call it though
[10:49:39] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: i suggest you look at html5 boilerplate...it'll show you how to make html5 backwards compatible
[10:49:55] <zeejy> So you could do, if (_.indexOf(foo, [4,5,6,7]) != =1) ..
[10:50:06] <dogarrhea2> no time now. i don't actually even need a circle..
[10:50:12] <dogarrhea2> to be drawn in html5
[10:50:16] <dogarrhea2> i'm just testing out some calculations
[10:50:38] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: so test your calculations in html5
[10:50:41] <jmqq> @zeejy: cool, I didn't know that library. I was thinking myself, what other character could one use instead of $ :)
[10:51:04] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: and stop being a stubborn jerk stuck in beginning of the millenium
[10:51:06] <zeejy> Yeah, check out Underscore.js: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[10:51:44] <dogarrhea2> diverdud`: not helpful
[10:51:49] <dogarrhea2> anyways http://jsfiddle.net/2h8HP/ nothing shows up
[10:52:26] <jmqq> @zeejy: nice, I didn't even know documentcloud either :D
[10:52:28] <dogarrhea2> crap
[10:52:33] <dogarrhea2> i'm too drunk no = sign allowed in css
[10:52:41] <SrPx> jQuery("#container").keydown(function(e){ console.log('test'); }); //why this dont work?
[10:52:53] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: jesus christ
[10:52:58] <dogarrhea2> and need px
[10:53:00] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: set a width and a height
[10:53:07] <dogarrhea2> yea i figured it out
[10:53:17] <dogarrhea2> i just got into work coming from a 2 am office party last night
[10:53:22] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: and stop using old technologies
[10:54:14] <dogarrhea2> i will when the rest of the world stops
[10:54:29] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: dont do webprogramming then
[10:54:48] <dogarrhea2> mm hmm
[10:55:13] <dogarrhea2> why are you using jquery then? yui3 is newer
[10:55:14] <dogarrhea2> gogogo gogogo
[10:55:22] <SrPx> nobody?
[10:55:48] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: no, its an alternative
[10:55:59] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: jquery is not obsolete
[10:56:02] <dogarrhea2> it's still newer
[10:56:12] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: were you born yesterday
[10:56:12] <dogarrhea2> jquery is older.
[10:56:15] <dogarrhea2> <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: and stop using old technologies
[10:56:20] <zeejy> @SrPx do a jsfiddle and past a link
[10:56:24] <dogarrhea2> are you having a problem communicating?
[10:56:33] <dogarrhea2> based on what you said previously, stop using old technology
[10:56:42] <dogarrhea2> jquery older than YUI. QEd
[10:57:14] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: /ignored
[10:57:20] <dogarrhea2> cool
[10:57:28] <SrPx> zeejy: code's too big
[10:57:34] <dogarrhea2> i'm tired of having my name highlighted anyways
[10:57:37] <SrPx> zeejy: probably because #container is not focused?
[10:57:51] <SrPx> zeejy: is there a global object that always triggers .keydown?
[11:00:35] <zeejy> @SrPx Is #container an input field?
[11:00:44] <zeejy> Because I'm pretty sure keydown can only be used on an input field
[11:01:33] <zeejy> What are you trying to accomplish?
[11:04:41] <why> On this page
[11:04:41] <why> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[11:05:02] <why> the map example is 30% down the page
[11:05:04] <why> why are you using the man page style non-useful approach to giving information?
[11:05:15] <why> why are the 7th, 8th, 9th lines of this page 3 simple examples of usage?
[11:05:33] <why> So annoying
[11:05:38] <why> I am not asking any other question other than why, so answering a different question to that is non-productive
[11:05:40] <why> either write a decent API with logical naming
[11:05:54] <why> or write docs in such a way that you can google snipe instead of remember all the faults
[11:06:32] <alakazim> Hi guys! I'm working on a calculator here http://jsfiddle.net/z8ZAQ/ but I don't know how to refresh the result fields , could anyone take a look?
[11:06:42] <Brodingo> lolwhy
[11:06:49] <discorpia> haha
[11:07:27] <discorpia> the irony is that you _can_ google snipe since it shows the Contents-list normally in the search result
[11:07:31] <lyrae> When i hover over an element, i could insert a background image from the left and in a loop move to the right 1px at a time to fill the element. is there a way to do this without an image? just with background-color ?
[11:07:37] <discorpia> and if you're a coder the function definitions are all you need
[11:12:20] <alakazim> If I use select fields, it will work, but if I use input fields it won't
[11:13:10] <dogarrhea2> yea i'm not insane.  why would i use a canvas (there's no need for me to manually draw things anyways, but besides that) and do double work? One for canvas and one for not canvas
[11:13:26] <dogarrhea2> the alternative is to just put something up saying "your browser is not html5 you're not my customer good bye"
[11:13:32] <dogarrhea2> what a joke
[11:13:38] <snover> or use one of the various shims that exist
[11:13:39] <dogarrhea2> or code twice.
[11:14:04] <snover> excanvas, flashcanvasâ¦
[11:14:22] <dogarrhea2> yes. code twice.
[11:14:43] <dogarrhea2> maybe i'll find a library that does that like soundmanger2
[11:14:49] <dogarrhea2> maybe i won't for what i'm doing.
[11:14:51] <snover> I donât think you understand what the word âshimâ meansâ¦
[11:15:34] <diverdud`> akosikeno:
[11:15:49] <diverdud`> snover: im pretty sure he does not even know what html is
[11:18:04] <dogarrhea2> you're fundamentally writing functionality twice.. i don't see a way around that. one for html5 browsers and one for non html5 browsers.  soundmanger2 is an example of that.  Fall back on flash if there's no html5. use Flash if there is. so the author basically coded twice.
[11:18:28] <dogarrhea2> how is soundmanager2 not writing functionality twice?
[11:18:49] <dogarrhea2> html5 audio where it exists. sound.play where html5 doesn't exist..
[11:20:32] <diverdud`> An exercise: figure it out!
[11:21:11] <dogarrhea2> it was a rhetorical question. they ARE writing the same functionality twice.
[11:21:46] <diverdud`> somebody please kick this moron
[11:22:30] <dogarrhea2> diverdud`: am I wrong? they are implementing something in Flash and html5.
[11:22:42] <nitzer> hi! im through an $.each loop , and I want to appendTo the result while the each is still looping, but i only get the appendTo display something at the end of the $.each .. this is the way it works? or is something wrong?
[11:23:07] <vini__> Hi for all, IÂ´m not developer o Jquery, but I need a help very easy --> here are the source and exemple --> http://jsfiddle.net/vanazzi/vcKdF/2108/ <-- same one can help-me in this case.
[11:23:11] <dogarrhea2> how is that not writing the same functionality twice?
[11:23:24] <jrockjiggz> hi, would anyone know how to write a function that uses jquery's $ outside of it's scope?  example: http://jsfiddle.net/zVEwg/2/
[11:26:03] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: What?
[11:27:52] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin:  on my site, $$$ is my jquery object.  i write jquery like   $$$( function($){ //my jquery bindings here });   but sometimes i need a global function that uses the $$$ jquery object, instead of writting $$$ on every line, i was hoping to pass the obj to the function and just use $ like normal jquery
[11:29:23] <freeed> jrockjiggz, just use jQuery('.blah')...
[11:29:34] <nitzer> jrockjiggz: try : window.$$$ = JQuery , and then use it on everywhere you like
[11:30:25] <jrockjiggz> i can use $$$ anywhere, but i like to write code using just $
[11:31:06] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to see if i can pass the $$$ obj into a function so it's $
[11:31:15] <jrockjiggz> but i'm not sure how to call the function
[11:33:03] <freeed> why even use $$$? why not just (function($){ //code here })(jQuery) or jQuery.ready(function($){ //code }
[11:33:23] <jrockjiggz> different versions of jquery
[11:33:48] <vini__> I want start this sound by JS, IÂ´m not know how I do this because the sound are started by jquery events. This code work well are here the exemple and source --> http://jsfiddle.net/vanazzi/vcKdF/2108/ <--
[11:33:50] <zeejy> @jrockjiggz Why are you using different versions of jQuery?
[11:33:53] <freeed> ahh.. makes sense. Why different versions? Just curious?
[11:34:12] <Jon47> has anybody used the .rule plugin, or could recommend something similar to it (something that allows you to dynamically modify css rules)
[11:34:29] <jrockjiggz> zeejy: its actually because i use prototype and uses $
[11:34:33] <polygon-pusher> looking for some help with an issue I'm having with jqyer where when I fade a background-image its adding to the hight of my div http://portlandcandle.com/
[11:34:45] <polygon-pusher> jquery*
[11:34:49] <freeed> Jon47, $('.myElement').css('width', '100px')
[11:35:19] <nitzer> hi! im through an $.each loop , and I want to appendTo the result while the each is still looping, but i only get the appendTo display something at the end of the $.each loop .. this is the way it works? or is something wrong?
[11:35:31] <Jon47> freeed - check out the .rule plugin and if you can't understand how it's different from the .css API then feel free to ask me questions
[11:36:24] <freeed> Jon47.. that's pretty neat looking.
[11:37:13] <Jon47> i'm pursuing potential options for a CMS that lets users modify rules dynamically..
[11:37:17] <freeed> polygon-pusher, jQuery Cycle? :p
[11:37:59] <polygon-pusher> no following you?
[11:38:01] <Eviltwin> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/38TzZ/
[11:38:06] <Eviltwin> Read through that
[11:38:15] <polygon-pusher> me?
[11:38:20] <polygon-pusher> oh wait sorry
[11:38:41] <freeed> nitzer, $('ul li').each(function(i) { $(this).appendTo('.someElement') }
[11:39:38] <vini__> Is possible make a Javascript play a JQUERY function with out start by events.
[11:40:33] <freeed> polygon-pusher, just mean thats a ton of script for what you're doing, and looks a little speghetti like.. changing widths and heights and such.. any reason you can't just use jquery cycle?
[11:40:55] <diverdud`> dogarrhea2: look into modernizr
[11:41:54] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: wow this is perfect, i really appreciate your explination. solution 3 is what i was looking for
[11:42:02] <jrockjiggz> big thanks
[11:43:05] <nitzer> freeed: if you can , check my code, i think it has something to do with the ajax request in between the each ... => http://beneficios-new.integrodev.com.ar/
[11:44:42] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin:  solution 3 you are returning the function, solution 4 you are saving to window obj.  what is the difference?
[11:44:57] <polygon-pusher> does  jquery cycle animate on background-image?
[11:46:49] <freeed> polygon-pusher... ohh, no :(
[11:47:08] <polygon-pusher> well the thing is that little bit of code I have does
[11:47:29] <smplstk> polygon-pusher: you can make cycle do whatever the heck you want
[11:47:30] <polygon-pusher> the only thing is that durring the fade it adds height to the div for some reason
[11:49:16] <polygon-pusher> ok so say I use  jquery cycle would I have to mod the core to get it to use background-image?
[11:49:44] <polygon-pusher> freeed vs smplstk comments
[11:51:13] <AaronCampbell> Is there a way to watch an element like a specific div for any changes in content?  For example, if jQuery('#something').html('new content') happens, can I catch that and perform another action like jQuery('#something-else').html('see it changed')
[11:51:30] <smplstk> polygon-pusher: what are you trying to do exactly?
[11:51:44] <smplstk> so, you want to use cycle to cycle a background image instead?
[11:51:47] <AaronCampbell> *Without modifying the first command, which is already in a shopping cart program...I want to extend it's functionality, without modifying core
[11:51:58] <polygon-pusher> http://portlandcandle.com/ is what I'm working on
[11:52:13] <freeed> polygon-pusher.. ok.. why are you changing heights of your container in your script then?
[11:52:14] <polygon-pusher> if you watch there is extra height being added durring the fad
[11:52:32] <polygon-pusher> they should be the same
[11:52:48] <polygon-pusher> but because if I dont set the hieght the div wont have any
[11:52:54] <igcewieling1> How would I find the id of the clicked element from inside a .click(...?
[11:52:56] <polygon-pusher> and with out that you cant see the image
[11:53:06] <mdunham918_> ah help this sucksâ¦ I'm using CKEditor and its inserting an inline style on images to set the height and width rather than just using the actual attributes. So what i need to figure out is how to use jQuery on an element to look for an inline style of width: and set it to the attribute and the same for height
[11:53:22] <polygon-pusher> since the image in not in the mark up the div doe not account for the height
[11:53:49] <mdunham918_> any ideas? Right now i'm doing $('img').each(function(){  if ($(this).hasAttribute('style')) {   wtf do i do here   }  });
[11:53:51] <polygon-pusher> so I make sure it does when I change the css in jq
[11:54:43] <mdunham918_> i thought about doing if ($(this).css('width')) but that would pick up all widths wait a minute that doesn't matter sweet thanks me
[11:55:38] <joshsmith_> are there any native javascript implementations of md5?
[11:56:10] <joshsmith_> or some other simple hash?
[11:56:21] <crankharder> this isn't working in FF 3-5: $("body").animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height() }, 600);
[11:56:25] <crankharder> simply no movement
[11:56:36] <zeejy> @joshsmith_ http://bit.ly/rPDQW4 :)
[11:56:58] <joshsmith_> zeejy: hah yes, I've googled
[11:57:12] <joshsmith_> just not sure if there was something native, or maybe there's something in Node.js
[11:57:19] <zeejy> @joshsmith_ Nope, nothing native in Javascript for it
[11:57:31] <polygon-pusher> Ah found it
[11:57:46] <polygon-pusher> it was an extra div I had for image cap
[11:57:55] <zeejy> NodeJS has some crypto modules
[11:57:59] <zeejy> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules
[11:58:05] <joshsmith_> ah yeah, just found that
[11:59:30] <vini__>     :-(       no body want help-me in a simply problem.

[12:00:41] <vini__> I want play my sound in JS. --> http://jsfiddle.net/vanazzi/vcKdF/2108/ <--
[12:01:02] <vini__> On load exemple or by a play_js, not need change the code
[12:01:15] <vini__> or logic just play by js
[12:02:14] <Eviltwin> vini__: Have you read through this? http://jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/
[12:02:38] <Eviltwin> I've never used this plugin before
[12:02:51] <Eviltwin> So I can't really help you except to try to steer you towards the documentation
[12:04:01] <zeejy> @EvilTwin Can I jump on the getting help bandwagon? http://jsfiddle.net/E7mUj/7/

[12:05:35] <xp_prg> hi all I want to select all elements that are of a table type with pattern commdtl2-toggle-, I am unclear how to do a wild card on the end sort of speak, here is what I have now:  $('a#commdtl2-toggle-1').click(function(event) {
[12:06:03] <xp_prg> actually not of table type, of <a href type
[12:06:15] <zeejy> @xp_prg you can do wildcards with a style of [id^=]
[12:06:27] <zeejy> So.. [id^=commdt12-toggle-]
[12:06:45] <xp_prg> zeejy but it is the end that is changing not the beginning
[12:06:53] <zeejy> correct
[12:06:54] <zeejy> :)
[12:06:59] <zeejy> That should work
[12:07:00] <AaronCampbell> Is there a way to watch an element like a specific div for any changes in content?  For example, if jQuery('#something').html('new content') happens, can I catch that and perform another action like jQuery('#something-else').html('see it changed')
[12:07:01] <AaronCampbell> *Without modifying the first command, which is already in a shopping cart program...I want to extend it's functionality, without modifying core
[12:07:08] <xp_prg> I will have commdtl2-toggle-1, commdtl2-toggle-2
[12:07:08] <dcarper> how can i take one elements click handler and apply it to another? ;)
[12:07:10] <xp_prg> etc...
[12:07:18] <zeejy> Right. That will work
[12:07:22] <AaronCampbell> Or is there a way to hook into an existing $.post() ?
[12:07:23] <zeejy> That says match the beginning
[12:07:30] <xp_prg> hmmm.. ok :>
[12:07:32] <xp_prg> thanks
[12:07:44] <zeejy> If it doesn't work, do a JSFiddle and I'll help
[12:09:08] <xp_prg> so this:   $('a#commdtl2-toggle-1').click(function(event) { would turn into this:   $([id^='a#commdtl2-toggle-']).click(function(event) {
[12:09:11] <xp_prg> is that right?
[12:10:02] <zeejy> Nope. $("a [id^=...").
[12:10:30] <xp_prg> hmm.. ok :>
[12:14:44] <xp_prg>  $('a [id=^commdtl-toggle-]').click(function(event) { this didn't work zeejy :(
[12:18:15] <hlveheart> so there's really no way to load google analytics externally, eh.
[12:18:16] <hlveheart> :(
[12:21:47] <xp_prg> figured it out, my fault thanks :>
[12:21:57] <xp_prg> zeejy thanks for your patience
[12:31:59] <ShaunR> i have a bunch of ahrefs all with the class button, then using jquery's $('.button').button(); some of these buttons i want to be disabled.  Whats the best way to disable them.  I trued adding disabled="disabled to the ahref but that doesnt work.
[12:35:52] <nitzer> ShaunR: $('.button').live('click',function(e){e.stopPropagation())).addClass('disabled') ;
[12:36:06] <Hierofant> Has anyone noticed that the new image gallery script on Huff Post is broken in Chrome?
[12:36:20] <Hierofant> which is weird, because it looks like jquery

[12:37:27] <darthpolly> hi, i'm trying to execute a script for every future insertion of an element in my page, i think that i can do this with the .on() method, but i dont know which type of event is this and I couldnt find a complete list in the jquery docs, can someone help me?
[12:38:44] <chovy> darthpolly: you can use .delegate too if you're using < 1.7
[12:44:03] <darthpolly> yeah, my problem is that i want to add a property to certain element in the moment that is inserted to the DOM
[12:44:17] <jamal> Hi every one
[12:45:02] <jamal> difference between document.getElementById() and $("id").val()
[12:45:03] <jamal> ???
[12:45:28] <jamal> any help pleae
[12:46:08] <nitzer> jamal: getELementById just get the element, and $('id').val() returns the value of the input
[12:46:12] <thinkt4nk> one returns an element object, another returns the value attribute of a jquery wrapped object
[12:46:27] <nitzer> +1 thinkt4nk
[12:46:33] <darthpolly> i was wandering i is there a event type for that purpose, so i can write something like $("p.specialParagraph").on("dominsert", function(event){ $(this).attr(blahblahblah); });
[12:46:35] <thinkt4nk> jinx ;)
[12:46:56] <ProLoser|Work> how long is the plugin site gonna be down?
[12:46:57] <thinkt4nk> darthpolly: I don't think there's a cross-browser event for this
[12:48:32] <darthpolly> thanks chovy and thinkt4nk, i'll work it out!
[12:49:01] <thinkt4nk> sorry I can't be of more help
[12:49:11] <thinkt4nk> I know I tried this very thing about six months ago
[12:49:39] <thinkt4nk> and while I found a solution that worked in a couple browsers, it wasn't cross-browser compatible, and I can't recall exactly what it was
[12:49:54] <thinkt4nk> my mind is going lol
[12:49:59] <darthpolly> hahah
[12:50:29] <darthpolly> ok, i'll stay online, just in case
[12:55:34] <fresco> anyone know of an example of retrying an AJAX request from within $.ajaxError that works in 1.7?
[12:56:36] <zeejy> @fresco Couldn't you put the AJAX request into a function and then call the function from within ajaxError?
[12:57:10] <fresco> zeejy: could do, but this is a generic AJAX error handler for the whole app
[12:57:40] <fresco> i'd like to be able to simply retry any request after the error (authentication, in this case) has been resolved
[12:58:00] <zeejy> Ah... I don't think that's possible because the global ajax error handler has no sense of what the original request was that failed
[12:58:11] <Matias_> is it possible to get the first child of a div without using a selection (.find(...))
[12:58:20] <Matias_> ?
[12:58:20] <thinkt4nk> zeejy: really??
[12:58:22] <fresco> zeejy: it does get the jqXHR and settings objects, though
[12:58:28] <thinkt4nk> yeah
[12:58:39] <fresco> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[12:58:44] <Matias_> actually I want the whole content
[12:58:49] <thinkt4nk> the only obstacle I see is avoiding an infinite loop
[12:59:00] <thinkt4nk> error > resend > error > resend
[12:59:13] <fresco> Matias_: div.get(0).firstChild.outerHTML?
[12:59:23] <thinkt4nk> and the approaches that come to mind immediately seem hacky
[12:59:44] <zeejy> @Fresco Hm...If you're not passing any kind of POST params with it, you could probably get enough info from jqXHR...
[12:59:50] <Matias_> is it standard? I don't think so fresco :P
[13:00:07] <zeejy> But if you wanted to retry the whole request, you'll find that that information isn't being passed back
[13:00:31] <fresco> thinkt4nk: I read that $.ajax(this) works in an error handler within $.ajax(), but can't find the equivalent within $.ajaxError()
[13:01:14] <fresco> Matias_: everything except the outerHTML is standard - there are other ways of getting the content
[13:01:25] <thinkt4nk> this is sounding more like a "yo dawg, we heard you like ajax in your ajax" meme with every moment
[13:01:36] <zeejy> Hah
[13:01:38] <fresco> heh
[13:01:45] <Matias_> the content has some inputs so I want it to call a handler to parse the form
[13:02:47] <Matias_> by the way, if there's a way to get an object from an array it's better!
[13:03:00] <Matias_> for example, nameOfTheInput: "value", etc
[13:03:09] <fresco> Matias_: i think you might need to provide an example
[13:04:04] <Matias_> $("<form><input name="test" value="example"/></form>").toObject()       =>     {test: "example"}
[13:04:06] <Matias_> freeed
[13:04:18] <Matias_> it would be amazing
[13:04:28] <freeed> eh?
[13:04:45] <Matias_> whoops, I mean, fresco
[13:05:22] <fresco> Matias_: tried .serializeArray()?
[13:05:35] <Matias_> well, I Know this function, it's not exactly the same, is it?
[13:06:16] <fresco> Matias_: apparently not, you're right
[13:06:30] <skyjumper> i don't suppose anyone's ever animated the opacity of VML element in IE?
[13:06:49] <Matias_> the output would be more like [{name:"test", value:"example"}]
[13:06:57] <Matias_> (with serializeArray)
[13:07:01] <Matias_> it's not bad though
[13:07:56] <skyjumper> weird thing is, i can $(vml_element).css('opacity', 0.5) or whatever, and that works fine
[13:08:16] <fresco> Matias_: https://github.com/maxatwork/form2js maybe?
[13:08:18] <skyjumper> but $(vml_element).animate({opacity: 0.5}) doesn't do anyhting
[13:08:21] <sanjayb> Matias_, there is a serializeObject plugin .. i kinda miss having that in core sometimes too. not sure the pros and cons though.
[13:08:44] <Matias_> oh, interesting, lets see both options
[13:09:55] <Matias_> "The plugins site is currently unavailable." u.u
[13:12:21] <xckpd7> do you cache when you're using jQuery for a widget?
[13:12:35] <Eviltwin> ?
[13:13:05] <xckpd7> I'm trying to convert some of my jQuery plugins I made for my site application to widgets, and in the plugin I used $(this) alot so I cached it but I guess in the widget I use this.element.... do I cache that
[13:13:33] <xckpd7> to be fair I'm just starting right this moment learning widgets, looking at documentation and stuff... just trying to convert some of my stuff over so I'm a tad confused
[13:14:15] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: this.element is actually already a jQuery object
[13:15:32] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: don't follow
[13:16:04] <Eviltwin> What do you mean you "cached" $(this)?
[13:16:32] <Eviltwin> Can you show what you're doing?
[13:16:51] <xckpd7> So again I'm using jQuery widgets to replace my plugins... so let's say I have a plugin which grabs a bunch of links and changes their color
[13:17:28] <Eviltwin> Okay, again, you're not actually answering my questions
[13:17:43] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: sorry I can explain this clearly
[13:17:55] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I'm caching for performance for instance when I do loops
[13:18:11] <Eviltwin> And I asked what you meant by that
[13:18:28] <Eviltwin> Code
[13:18:32] <Eviltwin> Code is what I'm looking for
[13:21:09] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/gx5rH/
[13:21:38] <skyjumper> solution if anyone's interested - $.animate() can call a function on each step
[13:21:45] <Eviltwin> And you did that so that when you have $("#foo, #bar").blueButton()
[13:21:59] <Eviltwin> They each get that code run for them separately, right?
[13:22:07] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: yeah
[13:22:15] <xckpd7> well
[13:22:17] <Matias_> form2js is pretty good! :D
[13:22:24] <Eviltwin> The widget takes care of that for you
[13:22:35] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: except inside the click handler, I could do without that
[13:22:38] <Eviltwin> If you do $("#foo, #bar").sortable()
[13:22:46] <Eviltwin> It calls the widget constructor twice
[13:22:48] <Eviltwin> Once for each element
[13:22:49] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: but inside that click handler, the scope changes, so I use it there too
[13:23:28] <xckpd7> So I don't have to worry about caching when doing widgets?
[13:24:36] <xckpd7> I've been reading up on widgets for the past 2 hours, I'm just having some difficulty digesting the information that I've found... still searching for a more comprehensive guide for someone not completely experienced
[13:24:57] <Eviltwin> Caching means a lot more than var $this = $(this);
[13:25:12] <MedlirWork> If I have table row, with four td cells, with text labels in cells 0 and 2, and input fields in 1 and 3... and an onchange event on the input in cell 3... what's the best way to select the input in cell 1 from there?
[13:25:16] <ajpiano> xckpd7: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[13:25:40] <ajpiano> might help a bit
[13:25:59] <Eviltwin> This also seems rather small for a widget
[13:26:07] <Eviltwin> Unless you're trying to add new functionality
[13:26:22] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, do you use the .meta plugin?
[13:26:32] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I don't use any plugins actually
[13:26:44] <Eviltwin> Aside from very occasionally
[13:27:00] <srji> it is possible to get .animate working with .click event?
[13:27:01] <murosai> what if i get  a query string like ({"population": "80,471,869", "area": "1,001,450 km2", "capital": "Cairo"}); with .getJSON, now how can i access the capital value of the returned object?
[13:27:17] <Whirl3d> wow, the plugins site is closed.
[13:27:44] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: In the future I want to be able to add different stuff... also, I'm trying to learn how to do widgets for some more of the complicated stuff, so I'm starting off light
[13:28:18] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: So probably part of the disconnect for you
[13:28:35] <Eviltwin> Is that there's a fair bit going on in the implementation for the widget API
[13:28:46] <srji> http://pastebin.com/R0VMYheW it doesnt work for me :(
[13:29:24] <Eviltwin> I suggest reading the source of some of the smaller widgets
[13:29:27] <Matias_> by the way, js2form is also pretty good! (same project, another functionality)
[13:29:46] <Eviltwin> ?.click @ srji
[13:29:56] <Eviltwin> Okay then
[13:30:01] <Eviltwin> srji: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[13:30:13] <Eviltwin> When something's not working for you, turn to the jQuery API first
[13:30:30] <Eviltwin> You can see that .click only accepts one function
[13:30:39] <Eviltwin> And it gets triggered on every click
[13:31:17] <murosai> i mean, let's say i have $.getJSON('ajax/test.json', function(data) {, is the returned data then a javascript object?
[13:31:30] <Eviltwin> murosai: Yes
[13:31:32] <srji> oh, thx
[13:32:30] <srji> is it possible animate an div with two clicks?
[13:32:47] <Eviltwin> srji: You mean a double click?
[13:32:53] <srji> no
[13:33:00] <Eviltwin> Okay, then explain further
[13:33:13] <srji> first click, the div get heigher, second click, the div gets smaller
[13:33:19] <Eviltwin> And third click?
[13:33:24] <monstaRtruck> lol
[13:33:29] <xckpd7> ajpiano: I did see that, it's just a tad bit over my head, way more than I need right now
[13:33:34] <monstaRtruck> 3rd click is system destroy
[13:34:08] <monstaRtruck> oh dood i think he means click once div.slide()
[13:34:11] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Those 24 slides are over your head?
[13:34:22] <monstaRtruck> click two div.slide
[13:34:41] <monstaRtruck> since slide is already toggled
[13:35:40] <srji> after the first the div gets height: 130px
[13:35:54] <srji> then, i click again on the div, the div gets height: 30px
[13:36:07] <srji> *first click
[13:36:20] <Eviltwin> And lets say
[13:36:26] <Eviltwin> That because it happens sometimes
[13:36:33] <Eviltwin> The user clicks more than 2 times
[13:36:40] <Eviltwin> What should happen?
[13:37:02] <ajpiano> xckpd7: it's a step by step walk through of like, the few things you need to actually do to really build a widget on your own...
[13:37:11] <monstaRtruck> u need to make togles urself then
[13:37:31] <monstaRtruck> just track each click
[13:37:42] <ajpiano> xckpd7: i think there's a video of me giving the talk somewhere, if that would help
[13:38:03] <gnarf> ajpiano: videos of you always help
[13:38:13] <monstaRtruck> so like click { var slidout = 1;
[13:38:30] <monstaRtruck> if slidout ==1) slidout = 0
[13:38:39] <snover> twtsss
[13:38:42] <gnarf> monstaRtruck: wow man, are you like typing on a phone?
[13:38:46] <monstaRtruck> lol
[13:38:48] <monstaRtruck> ya
[13:39:04] <gnarf> monstaRtruck: you are banned from trying to type code on a phone ever again
[13:39:06] <ajpiano> xckpd7: http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdpty/
[13:39:11] <monstaRtruck> sawriez
[13:39:22] * gnarf grins
[13:39:32] <monstaRtruck> srji after u set that tirnary var
[13:39:43] <monstaRtruck> then u do the div.slide
[13:40:12] <srji> hm
[13:40:24] <Eviltwin> srji: http://jsfiddle.net/QwCsD/
[13:40:25] <srji> do you mean a if/else statement?
[13:40:26] <monstaRtruck> if slidout == 1) slide('up') else slide('down')
[13:40:40] <gnarf> Eviltwin: boo
[13:40:45] <monstaRtruck> you can use ifs for now
[13:40:51] <gnarf> bind/unbind not needed
[13:40:53] <monstaRtruck> to spec out ur code
[13:41:02] <Eviltwin> gnarf: He still hasn't specified the final behavior
[13:41:21] <monstaRtruck> but when u get more advanced ull replace the ifs with a single line
[13:41:27] <monstaRtruck> variable function
[13:41:34] <xckpd7> ajpiano: I understand the basics, but once it starts getting into Javascript patterns and factories (as Evil twin brought up and even in the presentation) that's when I start to get a little lost. Everything else makes sense to me on a level.
[13:41:49] <ajpiano> xckpd7: you can skip that part
[13:41:53] <gnarf> monstaRtruck: and when you get even more advanced you'll replace the ternaries with things people can read :)
[13:42:01] <monstaRtruck> dood
[13:42:43] <gnarf> I only smile because I tend to write golfed code myself
[13:42:58] <gnarf> so hey srji - tell us what you want to do
[13:43:02] <gnarf> again please
[13:43:03] <gnarf> if you already did
[13:43:05] <Whirl3d> anybody got a reference for practical/theoretical OOP pattern development using jQuery?
[13:43:12] <gnarf> its way above my desire to scroll up and look
[13:43:28] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/QwCsD/1/
[13:43:37] <monstaRtruck> srji dont lisen to gnarf
[13:43:52] <srji> ?
[13:43:56] * gnarf frowns
[13:44:12] <monstaRtruck> he wants to make a toggle
[13:44:16] <gnarf> srji: what are you trying to do, that all these people are suggesting multiple ways to approach your problem?
[13:44:19] <Eviltwin> monstaRtruck: Where did he say that?
[13:44:23] <murosai> jQuery(this).prev("#infoBox").attr("id",""); <-- is this the correct syntax of changing the id of elements with id infoBox to none?
[13:44:30] <monstaRtruck> he wants to slide a div on click
[13:44:34] <monstaRtruck> then slide it back up
[13:44:40] <monstaRtruck> on click
[13:44:48] <srji> right
[13:44:55] <monstaRtruck> quary already has slidetoggle already built in
[13:45:02] <ajpiano> xckpd7: you don't want to draw an arbitrary line between what you can and can't grok... if you're a litle lost, that's ok, it helps create the foundation that will help you understand it the next time you encounter it
[13:45:09] <ajpiano> the widget factory *is* a "pattern"
[13:45:10] <srji> slidetoggle removes the complete div
[13:45:12] <monstaRtruck> but he needs it to be a specific size
[13:45:18] <monstaRtruck> right
[13:45:21] <srji> yes
[13:45:29] <monstaRtruck> so just make a toggle
[13:45:35] <Eviltwin> srji: If you want a toggle: http://jsfiddle.net/QwCsD/2/
[13:45:51] <monstaRtruck> every time u click alternate a var from 0 to 1
[13:45:59] <srji> i tried it first with a if/else statement, but i've in trouble with the click event
[13:46:09] <monstaRtruck> based on that value u can make the rest of the code
[13:46:14] <Foolson> Anyone who can help a newb with a simple thing?
[13:46:14] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/QwCsD/3/
[13:46:22] <gnarf> or you can write it in a tiny amount of lines
[13:46:29] <gnarf> just plug in the animation values yourself there
[13:46:42] <monstaRtruck> the whole tihng shouldnt be more than 3 lines
[13:46:55] <srji> Eviltwin: do the right thing
[13:46:56] <srji> :)
[13:47:34] <srji> it looks pretty easy
[13:47:37] <xckpd7> ajpiano: it makes sense, the part I was stuck on is what "this" means in context of a widget and/or a factory, and apparently the fact that caching isn't needed in a widget? everything else sorta makes sense
[13:47:38] <gnarf> the .toggle( fn, fn, fn ) function does a bind click that calls each in order
[13:47:48] <monstaRtruck> srji just paste us what u made so far
[13:47:58] <monstaRtruck> i dont want to write it for u
[13:48:01] <gnarf> no need to write that logic
[13:48:14] <ajpiano> xckpd7: 'this' refers to the instance of the widget you've created
[13:48:17] <k0rnel> http://heatwave.nodejitsu.com/
[13:48:34] <ajpiano> xckpd7: are you at all familar with like, the basic concept of constructors in javascript?
[13:49:18] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/toggle
[13:49:25] <gnarf> ^^ @srji
[13:49:30] <monstaRtruck> gnarf i like ur aproach
[13:49:37] <monstaRtruck> but i think he should write it out
[13:49:45] <ShaunR> i have a table that has a id, i want to remove all the <tr>'s below it.  Whats the best way to do this.. i was trying $('#myid').siblings().remove(); but that doesnt work.
[13:49:46] <monstaRtruck> just to learn the logic
[13:50:06] <dogarrhea2> how do you override the image map area to go to a specific function rather than link to something?
[13:50:28] <srji> toggle has no specific height
[13:50:29] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[13:50:31] <xckpd7> ajpiano: like prototypes? not really... I know that there is a person class and things can extend the person class but I don't know much else about it
[13:50:31] <gnarf> that one
[13:50:34] <gnarf> sorry
[13:50:36] <gnarf> toggle event
[13:50:46] <gnarf> the other is for the show/hide toggle
[13:50:52] <ajpiano> xckpd7: you need to get a grasp on how that stuff works
[13:51:00] <monstaRtruck> i told u not to lisen to him
[13:51:01] <ajpiano> and then you'll understand what 'this' means inside of the widget factory
[13:51:05] <monstaRtruck> lol
[13:51:30] <gnarf> monstaRtruck: y u trollin me bro?
[13:51:37] <xckpd7> ajpiano: Ok... I've read Javascript before on it, I just have never had a context to undrstand it in... like an applicable use case... so I'll definitely look at it
[13:51:56] <ajpiano> xckpd7: http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter8.html
[13:52:04] <ajpiano> xckpd7: well, then, right now is that applicable use case
[13:52:09] <ajpiano> cause what the widget factory is doing is like
[13:52:14] <xckpd7> ajpiano: exactly :)
[13:52:14] <srji> gnarf: it seem to be pretty simple, i'll try it, ty
[13:52:15] <ajpiano> you're building a constructor for a thing
[13:52:25] <Foolson> Anyone who can help a newb with a simple thing? I managed to get a friend to write this for me $("#site_wrapper").height($("body").height() + "px"); to change the height to 100% of body.  The he left me </3... And now i need to make so it do this every time the window is resized... Help please? :)
[13:52:37] <ajpiano> and then making new instances of that object and defining and interface to it
[13:52:39] <ajpiano> xckpd7: great
[13:52:45] <ajpiano> cool beans
[13:52:53] <monstaRtruck> wow he still much rather take ur advice
[13:53:04] <monstaRtruck> even tho im way more helpful
[13:53:15] <gnarf> monstaRtruck: who are you again?
[13:53:15] <xckpd7> ajpiano: thanks for all the help... I listen to your podcasts and stuff... making an effort to understand all this stuff
[13:53:17] <jedimind_> noone is more helpful than aj
[13:53:28] <jedimind_> and he's got purdy hair to boot, so you lose in all respects there
[13:53:37] <ajpiano> xckpd7: no prob  :)
[13:54:41] <gnarf> at least Eviltwin was writing a code example that was legible
[13:54:51] <Foolson> Nobody? :/
[13:55:22] <gnarf> i was just pointing out that jQuery has an API call for that exact behavior, so you might as well use it rather than jumble up some custom logic that could easily be broken when attempted by a novice
[13:56:13] <gnarf> sure, academically there is merit to learning HOW it does the toggle, but more interesting i think would be to look at the actualy implementation of .toggle() since it very cleanly wraps everything up
[13:56:29] <monstaRtruck>  okok jeez
[13:56:42] <ngharo> Foolson: throw that code inside $(window).resize(function() { // here  })
[13:56:48] <monstaRtruck> life is one big toggle jk
[13:57:00] <Foolson> ngharo thanks!!!
[13:58:29] <Foolson> Damn, dont seem to work.
[14:00:40] <Foolson> ngharo - So this should work? http://pastebin.com/MQymGZV1
[14:02:35] <murosai> say i have a <select> tag with id "id", how can i get the current value of the selection that is shown to the user?
[14:02:37] <Eviltwin> Why are you adding a px?
[14:02:53] <Eviltwin> murosai: .val() I believe
[14:04:23] <Foolson> ngharo - Are you there?
[14:05:12] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Are there test cases for jQuery functions?
[14:05:21] <Eviltwin> Regression tests
[14:05:42] <gnarf> Eviltwin: a ton of them
[14:07:11] <ngharo> Foolson: is this what you want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/dEbHq/
[14:08:17] <Foolson> ngharo i think so. *testing*
[14:08:21] <gnarf> Eviltwin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/test/unit
[14:08:35] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test/unit
[14:08:40] <gnarf> sorry missed the master
[14:09:52] <gnarf> Eviltwin: http://cl.ly/3y2W260B2G3T2a0y2x0z
[14:10:49] <Foolson> ngharo - It dont seem to work. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6029178/webdesign/vetej/index.html
[14:16:22] <Foolson> ngharo - Seems like jScrollPane is making a fuzz.
[14:17:52] <developernotes> if I am walking a DOM tree, is there a good way to test if a given element is a select list?
[14:18:11] <gnarf> developernotes: why are you walking a DOM tree?
[14:18:21] <gnarf> developernotes: and do you have a DOM node or a jQuery object?
[14:19:09] <Foolson> ngharo - This http://pastebin.com/Pc2LbunG activates jScrollPane. Maybe it should reload in the same way? With .resize?
[14:19:26] <developernotes> gnarf: I've got a jQuery object.
[14:19:39] <gnarf>  DOMNode.nodeName === "SELECT" or jQuery.is("select")
[14:19:53] <gnarf> developernotes: sounds kinda fishy though
[14:20:00] <developernotes> gnarf: great - thanks, I'll give that a try.
[14:20:08] <gnarf> sounds like you might be wasting some performance
[14:20:47] <gnarf> there are very few reasons to "walk" a dom tree
[14:22:46] <developernotes> gnarf: sorry, I meant DOM tree in a general sense - just walking a subset of a tree.  :-)
[14:23:16] <Foolson> ngharo - are you there? :)
[14:23:22] <gnarf> developernotes: again, like what are you trying to do that you can't do with .find() and .filter() ?
[14:23:31] <gnarf> and .closest()
[14:23:33] <gnarf> etc
[14:23:51] <gnarf> unless thats what you meant by "walking" :)
[14:24:25] <ngharo> Foolson: yeah reinitialize scollpane on resize: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/api.html#reinitialise
[14:26:31] <Foolson> ngharo - And how do i do that..? Im really sorry for being a pain in the ass, im a really fresh beginner when it comes to JS and Jquery...
[14:26:37] <developernotes> gnarf: I have a div, and it contains element that I only know by name.  I am doing a find - but sometimes the element is an input where I can call val() to get it's value, and sometimes it will be a select and I need to get it's selected value.
[14:27:05] <developernotes> gnarf: sorry, that should have been "contains", not contain.
[14:27:24] <gnarf> developernotes: .val() works on selects too
[14:27:34] <gnarf> it returns the "value" of the selected option
[14:28:47] <gnarf> div.find("input[name='whatever'],select[name='whatever']").val();
[14:29:07] <developernotes> gnarf: gotcha, I'll play around with it.  thanks for the feedback
[14:29:50] <ngharo> Foolson: all your jquery should go inside the document ready wrapper you have (where you call jScrollPane)
[14:30:12] <ngharo> Foolson: you should end up with somethin like this http://jsfiddle.net/488WA/
[14:32:09] <Matias_> div.dialog("close") doesn't remove the DIV from the DOM, I don't think it's a good idea since I won't use it anymore and next time I will create a new div to open the dialog. can I ask jQuery to remove it completely?
[14:32:19] <Matias_> .dialog("destroy") is the same
[14:32:30] <ngharo> ?remove
[14:32:39] <ngharo> bot-t :[
[14:32:56] <ngharo> Matias_: div.remove(); if you're paranoid
[14:36:09] <Matias_> thanks :P
[14:39:19] <dogarrhea2> hrm. the question now is:  How do I apply the concept of image map to Divs?
[14:39:59] <dogarrhea2> am i going to have to do some real hacky hack where i have a transparent image, overlay it on the div then in the image map function that handles the clicking of the map, do something?
[14:40:07] <ngharo> absolute positioning with click handlers
[14:40:29] <dogarrhea2> ok so basicallyt he strategy i said..
[14:40:35] <Foolson> ngharo - Thanks, it works <3
[14:40:44] <dogarrhea2> position the image absolutely over the div..
[14:40:51] <dogarrhea2> i wonder if there's a better way
[14:41:09] <dogarrhea2> i mind as well just use the image instead of a div altogether
[14:41:26] <pimperle> hi.
[14:41:28] <dogarrhea2> hopefully mouse stuff will be the same for both
[14:41:53] <kzim> hi
[14:42:02] <pimperle> i'm looking for a browser-independent way to handle keypresses and shortcuts in what will end up as yet another terminal emulator on the web
[14:43:06] <pimperle> i've found various implementations none of which looked like the goldstandard to use. does anyone here have a recommendation on how to reliably handle keypresses across browsers and operating systems using jquery?
[14:43:25] <kzim> i'm trying to understand how jquery work when for exemplei want jquery to submit a form inside a modal. i mean jquery inside ajaxed div seams no work well.
[14:43:55] <whatthepoop> using this plugin for nested sortables (http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/), anyone have any clue how I can disable certain elements (by class) from being *nestable*, but still allow them to be sortable?
[14:44:12] <kzim> i mean i try to dev a small application with a lot of edit/add/delete and perhaps i don't take the problem by the good side. i mean perhaps i need build a UI and fill it with json or something like that but i don't know how
[14:47:58] <xp_prg> I am in a function that was called from this:  $('a[id^=commdtl-toggle-]').click(function(event) {
[14:48:04] <xp_prg> how do I get the id it matched on?
[14:48:27] <ngharo> this.id
[14:48:30] <xp_prg> I tried typing console.log($(this).id) but it says undefined
[14:48:47] <ravenzz> $(this).attr('id')
[14:48:48] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: It's either this.id or $(this).attr("id")
[14:48:54] <xp_prg> hmm.. ok, thanks :>
[14:48:55] <Eviltwin> Not $(this).id
[14:49:15] <xp_prg> is there a way to dump all attributes etc... of a javascript object?
[14:49:16] <ravenzz> $(this) is a jquery object
[14:49:31] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects don't have an id
[14:50:47] <xp_prg> found it nice thanks!
[15:07:47] <donCams> am I right in thinking that .on does not listen to dom elements created through jQuery?
[15:08:00] <donCams> coz .live works
[15:08:36] <xp_prg> is there a way to list all the functions an object has?
[15:08:46] <xp_prg> kind of like dir(object) in python?
[15:14:55] <gaspar|work> Is there a way to use $('#element_id').html(some_text); and NOT have & turned into &amp; ?

[15:15:38] <dogarrhea2> basically how to let users wipe their butt and surf the web simultaneously?
[15:16:53] <skyjumper> gaspar|work: $.text()?
[15:19:06] <gaspar|work> skyjumper: Arhg, I hate vevo. Is there a way to escape everything BUT &? Whenembedding vevo videos & converted to &amp; causes embed code to break (video not found)
[15:19:48] <skyjumper> $.text() and escape everything else yourself?
[15:21:09] <gaspar|work> Isn't text doing the exact opposite?
[15:21:20] <skyjumper> not sure
[15:21:30] <gaspar|work> I am confused now, when I use .text() it shows the code and not video
[15:21:52] <skyjumper> $.text() won't be what you want then
[15:22:00] <skyjumper> doesn't create any markup
[15:22:17] <gaspar|work> when I use html() < and > are not converted, but & is.
[15:24:10] <solidus-lake> how do i check if the page is loaded or not?
[15:24:45] <skyjumper> i don't know exactly what you're doing (and dont have time), but it sounds like you could just create the elements+attributes individually
[15:24:45] <eddiemonge> onload? but why?
[15:25:03] <solidus-lake> I have a function that gets called before the page is loaded sometimes however I can't delay calling it untill the page is loaded because it's handled in a proprietary library
[15:25:30] <solidus-lake> eddiemonge: but is onload something i can put in an if statement? i thought that was a trigger
[15:25:59] <solidus-lake> hmm, i could make a function that runs when the body loads that sets a variable from false to true and only run my code if that variable is true
[15:26:46] <eddiemonge> solidus-lake: why cant you use a .ready() block or a $(window).load() block?

[15:59:27] <edgardo> z0ned, json might help you out.. you just have to make the data into arrays and combine them

[16:26:52] <eddiemonge> no bot-t ? how sad
[16:27:12] <z0ned> i have an ajax request which calls a php function that produces two independent json lists, what's the best way to return them both as one object so i can parse the two lists independently as json in jquery?
[16:27:47] <eddiemonge> z0ned: combine them into one array in php and then return that as json
[16:28:06] <z0ned> eddiemonge, should i json_encode that array as well?
[16:29:27] <eddiemonge> z0ned: yes. echo json_encode(array"keyforarray1"=>$array1, "keyforarray2"=>$array2)); exit;
[16:29:32] <z0ned> eddiemonge, $json[0] = json_encode[$arr1]; $json[1] = json_encode[$arr2]; echo json_encode($json);
[16:29:44] <z0ned> ?
[16:30:14] <z0ned> or just echo $json
[16:31:23] <eddiemonge> the way i did it
[16:31:40] <eddiemonge> unless its two arrays of similar data then your way is fine
[16:31:41] <z0ned> eddiemonge, i already have two json_encoded arrays, i just need to return them as one object
[16:31:47] <z0ned> eddiemonge, it is.
[16:31:57] <eddiemonge> wait that way doesnt work
[16:32:01] <whatthepoop> given the following: http://jsfiddle.net/5J38J/ -- how would I stop the 'label' divs (or, more specifically, the li they are within) from being dragged into the 'folder' ol? everything else can be draggable into and out of the 'folder' ol, but the 'label's need to be sortable only within the top-level. any clues?
[16:32:36] <eddiemonge> json_encode(array($arr1, $arr2))
[16:32:43] <ravic_> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/KbZC2/
[16:32:46] <eddiemonge> with an echo in front of it
[16:33:36] <z0ned> eddiemonge, echo json_encode(json_encode($arrForce), json_encode($arrOR));
[16:33:39] <z0ned> ? lol

[16:36:11] <discountrobot> hey guys i looking for a subtle slideshow plugin, any suggestions?
[16:36:13] <z0ned> ravic, for one it should be console.log.....but what is the problem?
[16:36:37] <z0ned> and what snover said^ :P
[16:38:20] <eddiemonge> snover: did you kick?
[16:38:48] <snover> if I kicked, it would say that I kicked
[16:38:56] <snover> for example
[16:38:58] <z0ned> lol
[16:39:02] <eddiemonge> i have messages turned off
[16:39:12] <snover> oh well, I guess I kicked coldhead for no reason
[16:40:21] <z0ned> eddiemonge, if i echo json_encode(json_encode($arr1), json_encode($arr2)); when i call parseJSON, what will the names of the other two arrays be parsed as? will that work?
[16:40:42] <eddiemonge> z0ned: stop trying to json_encode a json_encode
[16:40:53] <snover> derp
[16:41:43] <z0ned> .. so i have two json arrays, what do i echo to return them as one object?
[16:41:55] <eddiemonge> why are they json already?
[16:42:16] <z0ned> because i want to parse them as json independently in jquery when i receive the
[16:42:17] <z0ned> m
[16:42:42] <eddiemonge> garr!
[16:42:59] <eddiemonge> did json_encode them until you are ready to echo them out. otherwise keep them as regular arrays
[16:43:02] <z0ned> they both contain a fair amount of similar data, but i need to process them individually on the client side
[16:43:42] <eddiemonge> they would be an array of arrays and in JS you would loop through them like a normal array
[16:48:01] <discountrobot> hey guys i looking for a subtle slideshow plugin, any suggestions?
[16:56:39] <Columcille> I know it is possible to disable select on a draggable element; how can I disable select globally? Writing a custom dragable, not using the jQuery dragable for this, and I'm wanting to disable selection while the mouse is moving in a particular div.
[16:57:13] <Columcille> well nm
[16:57:19] <Columcille> no sooner do I say than I figure it out
[16:57:45] <acidjazz> wheres the best example to loading jquery asynchronously
[16:57:51] <acidjazz> isnt that the move
[17:02:29] <acidjazz> i wrote this http://pastebin.com/PZy3HzpJ
[17:10:44] <Jarred> What event is used for when my cursor enters an element, and when it leaves it? Not for when it moves inside the element
[17:15:33] <eddiemonge> mouseenter mouseleave?
[17:16:07] <Jarred> Mouseleave is called while the cursor is inside the element
[17:17:52] <MoTiOnXml> isn't there a match() function on string?
[17:17:54] <MoTiOnXml> this fails: typeof(arg).match(/^(string|number|boolean)$/)
[17:18:06] <MoTiOnXml> but MDN refers to match() on strings
[17:18:08] <MoTiOnXml> weird
[17:18:19] <MoTiOnXml> is match() deprecated?
[17:19:06] <MoTiOnXml> ah, test
[17:21:34] <eddiemonge> Jarred: so then what do you want?
[17:22:45] <Jarred> eddiemonge, If you go to http://dev.jarredsumner.com (warning: long page load and lots of images), hover over an image and you'll see what I mean. What I'm working on is very much half-done also.
[17:23:04] <eddiemonge> MoTiOnXml: var t = typeof ("string"); t.match(/string/)
[17:23:20] <z0ned> in my php (ajax call) i have $json[0] = json_encode($arr1); $json[1] = json_encode($arr2); echo $json;   when i pull that out in jquery, my data.responseText is nothing more than a string that says "\rArray", and data.responseText[0] is nothing. what am i doing wrong?
[17:25:21] <eddiemonge> Jarred: can you put a simplified example on jsfiddle
[17:25:38] <eddiemonge> z0ned: omg.
[17:25:48] <z0ned> ...lol
[17:25:50] <eddiemonge> you are completely ignoring me right?
[17:25:56] <z0ned> no!
[17:26:35] <eddiemonge> for the billionth time:  $json[0] = $arr1; $json[1] = $arr2; echo json_encode($json);
[17:28:01] <eddiemonge> dont json_encode until you are echoing it.
[17:28:45] <z0ned> eddiemonge, the two arrays will share variable names then?
[17:29:05] <z0ned> the data is similar.
[17:29:47] <eddiemonge> try it and see
[17:29:55] <Foolson> Hey guys i need help. I have this http://pastebin.com/jMYuAQ3R to make a div to be as high as body. But i want to have a navbar over it. So i need it to be bodys height minus 40px. Thanks in advance :) :)
[17:31:23] <z0ned> Foolson, why do you want the div to be the height of the body?
[17:31:54] <z0ned> and is there a reason you wouldn't just do it in CSS?
[17:32:24] <Jarred> eddiemonge, It's really complex to do a JSFiddle for
[17:33:01] <Foolson> z0ned Because i want it to adjust when i resize the window.  My bad, its the windows height i think, not body.
[17:34:03] <z0ned> Foolson, you want what to adjust? i'm confused what the end result is, because it seems like there's probably a better way to achieve whatever it is
[17:34:41] <Jarred> eddiemonge, Here's a pastie of it though --> https://gist.github.com/50b26c2161711bdd0202
[17:34:48] <Foolson> z0ned What i want it to do works. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6029178/webdesign/vetej/index.html
[17:34:52] <Foolson> But.
[17:35:03] <eddiemonge> Jarred: what exactly is it you are trying to do?
[17:35:19] <Jarred> eddiemonge, An overlay on hover for an image
[17:35:25] <Jarred> but there is going to be several iamges
[17:35:28] <Jarred> *images
[17:35:50] <ne0_> hello guys
[17:36:45] <ne0_> I have 2 selects in the top of my page. I need that when I change a select, reload the current page adding the values of that selects, anybody knows how to do that?
[17:36:48] <Foolson> I want to add a navbar over the div(the div that is the window height), but if i do that it becomes to big. So i need the div to be windows height minus 40px. Damn, its really hard to explain. z0ned
[17:38:34] <z0ned> Foolson, if you're already able to properly set the height of the div to the window height you want, why not just subtract 40 when you do it? then use css to give it a margin-top:40px? maybe i'm not understanding correctly
[17:40:04] <Foolson> The thing is, im a newbi who got alot of help by a friend. So i really dont jnow how to do it. But yes subtract 40px would do the trick.
[17:40:11] <z0ned> ne0_, you should write a listener for an onchange event of the first select, when you recognize it's been changed, get its value, and use that to determine the list of values for the second select and populate it. very common thing. should be a lot of examples online. search "jquery dependent dropdown" or something similar
[17:40:12] <eddiemonge> ne0_: why not use ajax to do it?
[17:40:19] <eddiemonge> Jarred: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/9w7HB/
[17:40:50] <eddiemonge> Foolson: position: fixed; height: 100%; sound like what you want
[17:41:03] <z0ned> Foolson, you should just use css..
[17:41:34] <Foolson> z0ned I cant do this with css... If i could, i would.
[17:41:54] <z0ned> Foolson, otherwise, look at line #7 in your pastebin, subtract 40. or better yet, subtract $("#navbar").height();
[17:45:07] <Foolson> z0ned - Where in this "$("#site_wrapper").height($(window).height());" do i put "subtract $("#navbar").height();" ? :)
[17:45:17] <svcghost> I want to get an array of objects on a page that have an active background-image set by CSS. Is the best way to do this to cycle through ALL the elements and check if they have a .css() background-image?
[17:45:22] <svcghost> and add them to an array if they do
[17:45:58] <z0ned> Foolson, you've never coded anything have you?
[17:46:26] <DRSK> Array storing data-type for option in select ? array name = jQuery('select option').each().attr('data-type'); or so?
[17:46:39] <Foolson> z0ned - Not Javascript no. As i said. Newbie.
[17:46:52] <svcghost> DRSK: was that directed to me
[17:47:19] <DRSK> No, it was a question how to store each data-type value in an array to be able to check if a variable exists in it
[17:47:36] <DRSK> not sure how to though, or set a variable based on each data-type, and then check what data-type is selected
[17:49:05] <z0ned> Foolson, you should try reading/learning a bit. the $("#site_wrapper") selects your div with the ID "site_wrapper" the .height(<a number here>) sets the site_wrapper div to be that height. so what's happening here is you're selecting the site_wrapper div, setting its height to be the height of the window. if you can't understand that one simple line, you'll never be able to do anything else on this project. i suggest you star
[17:49:05] <z0ned> t reading.
[17:50:28] <Foolson> z0ned now when you explain, in understand. Wow, its that simple. xD
[17:52:50] <Jarred> I wish one could have JS inside a stylesheet
[17:53:43] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/EmBtB/ :: how do I do something like I've tried there? I want to collect the values/data-types and set the 'separator' in the <code> based on the selected option
[17:57:01] <Foolson> z0ned - Now i understand how the row i built. What that does what. But, 'subtract' don't exist. So how do you write that?
[17:57:16] <z0ned> -
[17:57:53] <Foolson> facepalm om myself... xD
[17:57:56] <Foolson> on*
[17:57:57] <z0ned> lol.
[17:58:21] <Foolson> Yeah, a big lol. xD
[17:58:45] <z0ned> and in case you were wondering, addition is +
[17:58:46] <z0ned> ;)
[18:01:08] <DRSK> Anyone able to take a look? :: http://jsfiddle.net/EmBtB/1/
[18:01:20] <Foolson> z0ned Haha :)
[18:01:34] <DRSK> Instead of those if-cases, can I get the (;) or (:) or something?
[18:02:21] <Foolson> So, i need to put this in the right place "- $("header").height();"
[18:02:41] <Foolson> z0ned
[18:02:50] <z0ned> correct.
[18:02:53] <_chun> Hi -- is there any way to get a transition between display: inline (or inline-block) and display: block?

[18:05:12] <discorpia> hahaha
[18:07:29] <Foolson> z0ned - Ok, I have to study this alot more. Because, i dont understande where to place "- $("header").height();" xD
[18:09:31] <Foolson> z0ned - I did it! Yay. Thanks for the help. :D

[18:11:10] <bonhoffer> i am having a tough time getting a date to select, if, using datepicker, i do  minDate: "12/01/2011", everything works, if i use json to load the variable foo, where foo.start_date = "12/01/2011", then minDate: foo.start_date doesn't work
[18:11:31] <bonhoffer> do i need to escape it
[18:11:52] <bonhoffer> to convert it to a string -- i.e. is foo.start_date not a string ?
[18:12:08] <bonhoffer> or does it have a special character in it or something
[18:13:25] <bonhoffer> i'm trying to cast it as a string now

[19:00:43] <igcewieling1> I'm trying to disable all input elements which do not have the class 'diod'   I tried this, but it did not disable anything.  $('#account_edit :input').not('.diod').attr('disabled', true);  Does anyone have advice?

[19:29:17] <laszlokorte> Hey there!
[19:35:46] <laszlokorte> Can anyone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/UJxUG/2/ (scroll event delegation)
[19:44:15] <zulax> laszlokorte, http://jsfiddle.net/UJxUG/3/
[19:44:38] <zulax> all the page is covered by inner, so cant reach outer div
[19:46:22] <lyrae> When i hover over an element, i could insert a background image from the left and in a loop move to the right 1px at a time to fill the element. is there a way to do this without an image? just with background-color ?
[19:46:47] <lyrae> fill an element with a background color from left to right, like an animation
[19:48:21] <zulax> lyrae, is it like a box that you are trying to fill up?
[19:48:29] <laszlokorte> zulax: Thats right. inner is bigger than outer so that you can scroll up and downâ¦ now i want to bind an event on the scrolling. but it seems not to work via delegation but it is not documented anywhere...
[19:49:32] <lyrae> zulax: it's a <a>
[19:49:40] <lyrae> a link in navigation section
[19:50:14] <lyrae> i could do a:hover { background: #color} but i'd liek to fill it from left to right, px by px. a nice little animation =)
[19:50:24] <zulax> lyrae, maybe gradient?
[19:50:37] <lyrae> css3 or jquery plugin?
[19:52:19] <zulax> css3 for sure,
[19:52:37] <zulax> its just an idea
[19:52:46] <zulax> http://gradients.glrzad.com/
[19:53:02] <zulax> probably you could run a loop and continuously change the gradient
[20:29:25] <Jobbe> Hi
[20:30:00] <amirong> shutup
[20:35:02] <Jobbe> Looking for an autoupdate script with a toggle feature, anyone got a link ?
[20:49:57] <ch3mical> Yes yes, ya'll
[21:28:09] <martisj> anyone know why I get successNotice is not defined when console.log(successNotice) gives me [p#success] right before I call successNotice.hide();
[21:28:10] <martisj> ?
[21:29:46] <djQuery> ?newcontent
[21:30:04] <djQuery> dangbot-t
[21:30:37] <djQuery> gnarf  u here
[21:31:16] <gnarf> djQuery, yeah
[21:31:47] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/1003630
[21:32:01] <gnarf> djQuery, i found that using that nifty "search gists" thing :)
[21:33:41] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/uUvPe/1/ found it using google
[21:34:02] <djQuery> garf thanks though
[21:34:03] <yamahaalex37> can anyone help me figure out why this happens, or how to fix it
[21:34:11] <yamahaalex37> after one arrow click, the auto scroll banner breaks
[21:34:11] <yamahaalex37> http://shimlabs.eternaware.com/
[21:35:47] <gnarf> djQuery, the gist is more up to date
[21:40:05] <martisj> now I'm getting "name is undefined -> name = name.toLowerCase();" from the jquery source :(
[21:40:18] <martisj> Why would that even show up?
[21:40:58] <djQuery> gnarf: cool thanks
[21:44:01] <igcewieling1> I am trying to disable all options of a select element, except for the option with a specific value.  I've tried several things, most recently a .each().  Does anyone have any ideas?
[21:44:56] <djQuery> I hate trying to format code in stackoverflow
[21:46:26] <sarmiena_> galleria 1.2.5 seems to be erroring out with "could not extract height/widthâ¦" on chrome 15.0.874.121
[21:46:26] <martisj> figured it out.. Wow that was ridicutarded
[21:47:14] <djQuery> gnarf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1314984/problems-with-livequery-and-rte-on-firefox-3-5-2/8365828#8365828
[21:47:45] <sarmiena_> the strange thing is that it's broken in the download package from http://galleria.aino.se/download/ but it works on the demo site http://galleria.aino.se/themes/classic/
[21:47:53] <sarmiena_> has anyone come across this?
[21:54:15] <igcewieling1> This doesn't work, but I have no idea why. $('#route_edit select[name="trunk_group_sid"] option').not('#route_edit select[name="trunk_group_sid"] option:eq(1)').attr('disabled', true);
[22:24:09] <djQuery> igcewieling1: you do know the selector works right to left correct?
[22:25:55] <djQuery> $('#route_edit').find('select').filter('[name="trunk_group_sid"]'). etcccccc would be a lot faster. and you could debug it easier
[22:28:24] <igcewieling1> djQuery: I was trying something like http://pastebin.com/2bXSmjK8   I don't know JS or jquery very well.
[22:28:59] <igcewieling1> $('#route_edit').find('select').filter('[name="trunk_group_sid"]').attr('disabled', true); ?
[22:29:41] <djQuery> oh and what version of jquery? you might need to use prop and not attr
[22:29:50] <igcewieling1> it is a recent one.
[22:30:05] <djQuery> then prop not attr

[22:32:09] <christo_m> Hello, id like to do a simple expand on hover like this http://monokro.me/
[22:32:15] <christo_m> anyone have any idea how i can do this
[22:32:18] <djQuery> Â ifÂ ($(this).val()Â >Â 2)Â {      should just be if(this.value > 2){
[22:33:03] <igcewieling1> What I can't seem to get is the options with a value > 2 to become disabled.  I'll try prop()
[22:35:43] <igcewieling1> I would have thought since .prop is a jquery thing.  $('this').prop('disabled', true);
[22:36:13] <djQuery> igcewieling1: http://pastebin.com/n3JrpN6b
[22:38:35] <igcewieling1> I do not understand how, but that code does indeed work.
[22:39:35] <dcope> Is there a way to apply a jquery function to an array of elements?
[22:39:48] <dcope> ie I have 20 links that all should call the same function
[22:39:54] <dcope> When clicked
[22:41:58] <igcewieling1> from my meager understanding shouldn't this "var $this = $(this); $this.prop('disabled', true);" be exactly the same as "$(this).prop('disabled', true);" ?
[22:42:01] <djQuery> $('a').click
[22:43:12] <djQuery> igcewieling1: yes except doing $(this) has overhead so I only do it once instead of 5 or 6 times that you were doing it
[22:43:27] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use angularjs?
[22:43:29] <dcope> djQuery: Is it possible to add more filters to that though?
[22:43:45] <dcope> Actually, nevermiind
[22:44:01] <djQuery> dcope: can you do it in CSS? then yes
[22:47:33] <bobdobbs> Is there a way to check the state of a variable at any given point in time from firebug ?
[22:49:33] <igcewieling> djQuery: thanks for the help.
[22:49:56] <djQuery> igcewieling: no probs
[22:50:17] <djQuery> bobdobbs: just open console and type the var name and hit enter
[22:50:47] <bobdobbs> Ah.
[22:50:52] <bobdobbs> Silly me.
[22:51:23] <bobdobbs> I was trying this before it wasn't registering it as working. I must have been misspelling the var name or something
[22:51:25] <bobdobbs> doh
[22:51:59] <dr0id> var needs to be global too
[22:52:10] <bobdobbs> of course
[22:53:50] <bobdobbs> Ah. If I want something to be global, do I have to declare it outside of document.ready ?
[22:55:47] <christo_m> Sorry, does anyone know how i can do a proper expand on hover
[22:56:03] <christo_m> http://www.bosshost.ca/  those divs there i do in two steps currently
[23:00:36] <ragas> .hover ?
[23:02:07] <sirtophat> It seems $.get() returns [object Document] for anything that's not in the same directory as it
[23:03:36] <christo_m> ragas: yes..
[23:04:45] <sirtophat> oh wait
[23:04:46] <sirtophat> never mind
[23:15:22] <Umren> in javascript there is a method ".match" how to use it proper with jQuery? do i have to .val() first? or do .each()? if u need to cycle match against many elements that is selected
[23:37:56] <SrPx> hey guys im having problems with using jquery.
[23:38:39] <SrPx> everytime I have a bug in my callback function called by jQuery.when, im getting wrong line numbers. all my code is inside that function because thats when document is ready. so what can i do
[23:39:20] <SrPx> in other words i lost the ability to debug my program
[23:55:55] <Umren> why do val() only works with first item selected?
