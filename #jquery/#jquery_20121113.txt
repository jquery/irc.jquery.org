[00:00:57] <adamholwerda> or just right inside poll(){ before $.ajax do the alert
[00:01:08] <joobie> that works
[00:01:11] <joobie> alert in the complete
[00:01:16] <adamholwerda> boom
[00:01:32] <joobie> but it doesnt trigger on success
[00:02:06] <adamholwerda> haha
[00:02:28] <adamholwerda> what about putting a script in the xhr you're getting
[00:02:40] <adamholwerda> or an alert
[00:02:44] <joobie> xhr?
[00:02:49] <adamholwerda> the ajax
[00:03:20] <joobie> I want to replace alert("test") with some script.. but right now it's not firing on success
[00:03:29] <joobie> like oncomplete is meant to handle the re-polling
[00:03:40] <joobie> and then when a pass completes successfully, it should run that other function
[00:03:57] <joobie> not sure if that answers your Q:/
[00:04:13] <adamholwerda> if you're getting a script though with ajax, it's going to run when it comes back
[00:04:37] <joobie> oh
[00:04:42] <adamholwerda> hence your success
[00:05:09] <joobie> but why does the alert not come up?
[00:06:04] <adamholwerda> not sure. gotta hit the sack though, you'll figure it out
[00:06:07] <adamholwerda> night!
[00:06:19] <joobie> thanks adamholwerda for the help!
[00:06:23] <joobie> good night
[00:10:29] <tcberner> good morning
[00:13:07] <Narhir> Hi guys... I have a grid of blocks 3x3
[00:13:39] <Narhir> and I want if someone hover over 1 block this block will resize to double size in width and height into right for example...
[00:20:34] <tcberner> Is there a way to find out, why IE9 always switches to "IE9 Compatibilty/IE9 Standards"? -- I changed the doctype to a pure <!doctype html> and also set X-UA to edge. But still it is not "IE9/IE9 Standards"
[00:22:05] <Cork> tcberner: try validating your html
[00:22:23] <Cork> tcberner: your site might also have ended up in the legacy database
[00:22:33] <Cork> and then you need to add a meta tag
[00:24:11] <tcberner> Cork: Html1202 -- Intranetsites in Compatibility mode *grml*
[00:36:44] <jrockjiggz> if I submit a form in a lightbox, i loose the form.. is there a way to 're-send' the httpRequest with the same information using dev tools?
[00:49:09] <Cork> jrockjiggz: simplest is prob to serialize the form and save that in an object
[00:49:20] <Cork> jrockjiggz: and then resend it through ajax
[00:49:41] <jrockjiggz> Cork: hmm, ok
[00:49:50] <Cork> or have a small loop that refills the form again
[00:50:51] <jrockjiggz> Cork: sweet, i found it http://i.imgur.com/tm9oX.png
[00:50:51] <Cork> like $.each(arr, function(field) { $form.find('[name="'+ field.name +'"]') }).val(field.value); });
[00:54:46] <retrostyle|15> hey ho what is better to save credentials localstorage or sessionstorage
[00:59:10] <Cork> retrostyle|15: localstorage has quite big performance problems so you should be really careful about using it
[00:59:42] <retrostyle|15> ohh ok
[00:59:46] <Cork> retrostyle|15: and its modifiable by the user, so ...
[00:59:52] <Cork> its not really the best place to store it in
[00:59:53] <retrostyle|15> and sessionstorage?
[01:00:17] <Cork> not 100% sure what you mean, but if you mean a session cookie
[01:00:24] <Cork> sure, just use a session reference though
[01:00:29] <Cork> and store the rest server side
[01:02:27] <retrostyle|15> Thanks for your help I think I have a solution
[01:03:08] <retrostyle|15> on the server side I check edthe already
[01:23:06] <gjvc> retrostyle|15, see also www.jstorage.info
[01:24:26] <retrostyle|15> thx gjvc i will have a look

[01:38:40] <henn1nk> use
[01:38:54] <jrockjiggz> just showing you it works
[01:39:11] <jrockjiggz> you must not have your selections correct
[01:39:58] <henn1nk> jrockjiggz: yeah but what is my mistake? :-)
[01:40:35] <jrockjiggz> henn1nk: i really can't tell
[01:41:18] <henn1nk> hmhm..
[01:45:45] <joobie> guys I have something like this - http://pastebin.com/FAqByUne - which basically scrolls to the bottom of the page then scrolls up
[01:46:08] <joobie> what I want to do though is keep running that over and over again, until another ajax call comes in and interrupts it
[01:46:18] <joobie> how can I keep it in a loop so it keeps running?
[01:46:28] <joobie> I tried while(true) { } but that just crashed my browser..
[01:50:55] <runvnc> setInterval
[01:50:58] <runvnc> joobie

[01:54:25] <henn1nk> jrockjiggz: got it.
[01:54:36] <Supervan> any idee?
[01:59:21] <runvnc> supervan http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5570747/jquery-posting-json
[01:59:23] <runvnc> do it like that
[01:59:32] <runvnc> use the dataType property instead
[01:59:41] <runvnc> of just putting 'json' as the last arg
[01:59:51] <runvnc> and then you can give it the object the way you are
[01:59:52] <runvnc> I think
[02:00:23] <maloik> Has anyone used the select2 plugin extensively? Having issues using it as an advanced search form, where the autocomplete entries that are fetched remotely take you to that object directly, but you can still submit the form
[02:01:41] <runvnc> nevermind supervan I misunderstood the question
[02:02:22] <runvnc> try this one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4240763/sending-php-json-encode-array-to-jquery
[02:02:29] <runvnc> console.log the response
[02:02:35] <runvnc> if it looks like json but isnt parse
[02:02:35] <runvnc> d
[02:02:50] <runvnc> you can just use $.parseJSON as in that answer
[02:03:50] <runvnc> gnight
[02:25:51] <subdesign> question: why my hover effect "blinks" when i point on the side of the target div. pointing in the middle works ok.
[02:38:38] <Anticom> haha, i survived the maintanance :D
[02:38:47] <Anticom> subdesign fiddle?
[02:39:22] <subdesign> Anticom, ahh.. complex thing
[02:39:22] <grafi> sounds like its toggled over and over again ...
[02:39:43] <grafi> what's the hover effect do? change the size?
[02:39:49] <Anticom> well subdesign : no code, no solution :P
[02:40:11] <subdesign> Anticom, right i know, i hope maybe someone met this before
[02:40:21] <subdesign> grafi, fadeIn
[02:41:31] <subdesign> anyway: http://pastie.org/5370940
[02:41:45] <subdesign> two effect in one..
[02:42:22] <Anticom> .rotate() ?
[02:42:29] <subdesign> a plugin
[02:42:33] <Anticom> url?
[02:42:42] <subdesign> http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/wiki/Examples
[02:42:49] <Anticom> ty
[02:43:40] <Anticom> subdesign http://jsfiddle.net/8LV3p/ the image is a rectangle. when you hover its bottom left corner it should replicate your bug
[02:43:48] <Anticom> so it's caused by the plugin itself i guess ;)
[02:44:20] <Anticom> and since a circle, or whatever you're trying to animate is placed on a square image aswell you won't be able to avoid this behaviour
[02:44:31] <subdesign> i see
[02:44:47] <subdesign> thx
[02:44:52] <Anticom> well you could add a timeout on mouseover and check in the callback wether the image is still hovered
[02:44:59] <Anticom> this could avoid this behaviour
[02:45:06] <Anticom> know what i mean?
[02:45:09] <subdesign> sure
[02:45:15] <Anticom> alrighty, happy coding :>
[02:45:28] <subdesign> thanks
[02:46:08] <Anticom> subdesign http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1273566/how-do-i-check-if-the-mouse-is-over-an-element-in-jquery/1273609#1273609

[02:47:32] <Anticom> btw i love the glitchynes of this rotate-plugin it's hillarious :D
[02:48:28] <javalover> is there a way in html to attach data to a jquery object?
[02:48:35] <javalover> or do I have to check & see if the data exist & then add it?
[02:48:49] <hdon> javalover, what?
[02:48:51] <Anticom> http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
[02:49:03] <hdon> javalover, do you mean --- yeah what Anticom said, is that what you mean?
[02:49:09] <Anticom> it's part of html5 specs
[02:49:30] <javalover> ok so basicaly i am modifying an object
[02:49:30] <hdon> javalover, anticom think you mean .data() (right?)
[02:49:37] <javalover> but i want to see if it's been modified before
[02:49:38] <Do``> i need to create custom events with native javascript code, but they don't seem to be caught with jquery's event binding in IE8. has anybody seen anything like this? http://jsfiddle.net/RVfWN/13/
[02:49:55] <javalover> like i'm changing it's top attribute
[02:50:01] <javalover> but i want to know where it started
[02:50:02] <Anticom> no javalover want's to attatch data in the html to be able to read it in js
[02:50:04] <Anticom> don't you?
[02:50:12] <javalover> well both ways will work..
[02:50:22] <javalover> i'm just trying to see if i have to add it upon first check or what's the proper way to do this
[02:50:28] <javalover> i just want to see if it's been modified yet
[02:51:09] <javalover> cuz if it's the first time then whatever it's top is set to is where I want it to go back to
[02:51:10] <hdon> javalover, what's your grander purpose?
[02:51:22] <javalover> well...
[02:51:28] <javalover> basically the user is going to edit something
[02:51:31] <javalover> and I want an undo feature
[02:51:49] <javalover> so if I know where the object started
[02:51:53] <javalover> then I can go back to that origin
[02:52:17] <hdon> sounds more like "revert" feature. if you'r doing "undo" then the correct solution is very different: just maintain a stack of reversible revisions
[02:52:30] <javalover> sure
[02:52:39] <javalover> but I just need to know if it's been modified or not
[02:52:41] * hdon shrugs i know it's just arbitrary terms, just want to understand
[02:52:41] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:52:46] <javalover> and I figure attach a variable to the object itself
[02:52:54] <hdon> javalover, why not just use more than one data- attribute?
[02:53:00] <javalover> well yes
[02:53:02] <javalover> but i'm asking
[02:53:08] <javalover> can I specify this when I create the object in html?
[02:53:11] <hdon> javalover, data-foo="foobar" data-original-foo="foobar"
[02:53:13] <javalover> or do I have to add upon check
[02:53:38] <javalover> cuz I can do like style = "top:10px";
[02:53:43] <hdon> javalover, $('div').data('foo', 'bar') is roughly equivalent to <div foo data-foo="bar">
[02:53:45] <javalover> so i have that value ...
[02:53:53] <javalover> but can i do a value for anything?
[02:54:02] <hdon> "do a value for anything?"
[02:54:02] <javalover> oh ic
[02:54:12] <javalover> no you answered it
[02:54:14] <Anticom> don't get it either
[02:54:17] <hdon> ok :)
[02:54:20] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/fFVZ5/
[02:54:26] <hdon> i think i know what javalover is doing :)
[02:54:32] <javalover> yeah
[02:54:46] <Anticom> haha i usualy don't even know what i am doing :D
[02:54:49] <hdon> i did something similar before data- attributes
[02:55:13] <hdon> Anticom, no worries. usually you can find at least one other person who knows better what you are doing than you do yourself
[02:59:16] <maasha> ah, that fiddle thing is neat. I didn't new that one before
[02:59:29] <maasha> So here is my problem -> http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7ks/
[03:00:13] <hdon> javalover, see Anticom's fiddle
[03:01:17] <hdon> maasha, that doesn't look like a problem, just a fiddle
[03:01:31] <maasha> hdon: ?
[03:01:42] <hdon> maasha, what is your "problem?"
[03:01:56] <maasha> hdon: I am trying to get each node to collapse on click.
[03:02:28] <maasha> hdon however, the root node collapse everytime. I may have misunderstood what toggle is doing or there is a namespace problem?
[03:02:36] <hdon> oh, i see
[03:02:58] * hdon makes a change
[03:05:03] <maasha> hdon: so you can update this fiddle?
[03:05:27] <hdon> maasha, anyone can.
[03:05:35] <maasha> neat!
[03:06:40] <maasha> hdon: some I am trying to learn here. Did you note anything sticking out?
[03:07:22] <hdon> maasha, yes but first i'm cleaning it up so that you have a better frame of reference when reading the functional changes, and also you'll see better how to use jfiddle
[03:07:58] <maasha> hdon: excellent
[03:11:22] <hdon> maasha, so here is a version that is a bit more appropriate to jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7ks/1/
[03:12:39] <maasha> hdon: of cause (I dont see the HTML though) - I had just pooled HTML, CSS and JS together for pasting using pastie - I only just found jsfiddle.
[03:13:13] <hdon> maasha, i imagined you just found it :) so, no functional changes, only changes to conform to jsfiddle. i do not have an <html> or <head> or <body> tag, those are provided by jsfiddle. in fact i have no HTML at all. i have moved the content of your <style> tag to the CSS pane. i moved your <script> for jquery into the left bar ("Choose Framework,") moved your other script to the Script quadrant, and i removed the onDomReady handler becaus
[03:13:13] <hdon> e you can select that from a drop-down box on the left-hand bar
[03:13:41] <hdon> maasha, jsfiddle imposes some minor annoyances on you, but within those limits you can express problems or tricks very eloquently
[03:13:48] <hdon> now what is wrong with your code:
[03:16:37] <maasha> debugging recursive code is a pain.
[03:16:49] <WingmaN> is there anybody that can help me for a sec?
[03:17:19] <Trisox> just ask your question
[03:18:01] <WingmaN> I'm tryin to get a JSON data like, { "score": 131123, etc but couldn't fetch data with .getJSON
[03:18:29] <hdon> wow
[03:18:41] <hdon> maasha, i hate ^w these days :(
[03:18:59] <WingmaN> says, valid JSON url but, still can't.
[03:19:08] <Cork> WingmaN: run it through json validate
[03:19:14] <WingmaN> I did
[03:19:29] <Cork> is it on the same domain?
[03:19:29] <WingmaN> want me to paste, json data I'm workin on?
[03:19:32] <maasha> hdon: hate what?
[03:19:39] <hdon> maasha, control-w
[03:19:46] <Cork> WingmaN: is the json on the same domain as your webpage?
[03:19:59] <WingmaN> no
[03:19:59] <hdon> on my keyboard, it is to delete a word in many programs, but also in many newer programs it closes the window :|
[03:20:08] <WingmaN> it's API from different web.
[03:20:54] <Cork> WingmaN: then you have why
[03:21:01] <Cork> WingmaN: you can't fetch json cross domain
[03:21:13] <maasha> hdon: I dont get it.
[03:21:15] <Cork> or any other form of ajax calls for that matter
[03:21:25] <Do``> if i define a custom event with native js, jquery bind() doesn't pick it up in IE8. what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/RVfWN/13/
[03:21:34] <Cork> WingmaN: only option is to get the server to send jsonp, or to proxy it over your domain
[03:21:46] <WingmaN> I was fetchin another JSON data with same code, only difference is json type I guess.
[03:22:17] <Cork> Do``: not sure its valid to define custom events like that
[03:22:35] <Cork> Do``: thats old dom1 syntax, and i don't think custom events existed back then
[03:22:50] <Do``> Cork: native js event handlers pick it up and this is what i found on various sites explaining how to do custom events
[03:22:59] <Cork> try document.body.attachEvent('oncustomerEvent')
[03:23:15] <Cork> Do``: well the syntax is way old
[03:23:20] <Do``> the problem is with using the event handler?
[03:23:24] <Cork> and you should use modern event listeners instead
[03:23:31] <Do``> okay, lemme try
[03:23:44] <Cork> (attachEvent is ie only btw)
[03:24:03] <Cork> its addEventListener in the other browsers
[03:24:27] <Do``> hm
[03:25:28] <WingmaN> can you check that one, what's wrong in it http://jsfiddle.net/QJ7RX/
[03:25:43] <hdon> maasha, oh, did you choose the JSON representation of this taxonomy?
[03:26:00] <Cork> WingmaN: its cross domain
[03:26:02] <maasha> hdon: better than XML.
[03:26:11] <Cork> WingmaN: you can't request json cross domain
[03:26:16] <Cork> i already told you
[03:26:26] <Cork> jsonp is the only format you can use
[03:26:34] <hdon> maasha, probably ;)
[03:26:36] <Cork> ?jsonp @ WingmaN
[03:26:37] <bot-t> WingmaN, JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[03:27:01] <maasha> hdon: also, JSON is ideal for representing such a tree. There is potentially many nodes, but maximally 8 levels.
[03:31:36] <shwaiil> hi
[03:32:27] <maasha> hdon: so any ideas where my problem may be?
[03:32:30] <shwaiil> Q: How to create a function that does "foo" and then when finish returns another function ? :T I've tried to put the function name as a param etc but it seems it didn't worked
[03:32:32] <shwaiil> how is that done ? tks
[03:33:01] <Cork> shwaiil: return it?
[03:33:24] <shwaiil> Cork: tks for looking, I mean just run it
[03:33:46] <Cork> you mean like function test() { var call = function() { console.log('works'); }; return call; }; test()() ?
[03:33:51] <Do``> Cork: it doesn't seem to work, and i found in google that attachEvent in IE doesn't support custom event names
[03:34:25] <Cork> Do``: interesting, didn't know that
[03:34:33] <Do``> http://jsfiddle.net/RVfWN/15/
[03:34:38] <Cork> Do``: why do you need native dom custom events btw?
[03:34:50] <Do``> i have a small embeddable javascript widget
[03:35:01] <Do``> and it wont include any js library
[03:35:10] <Do``> but it needs an event that lets the embedder know it finished loading
[03:35:18] <Do``> and the API is now usable
[03:35:18] <Cork> ah
[03:35:28] <Do``> so i need to trigger an event
[03:35:36] <shwaiil> cork something like fn('Michael', function(name){ console.log('say hello to ' + name) }; var fn = function(name, fn){ if (name == 'Michael') { return fn; } }
[03:35:55] <Do``> and that event doesn't work from jquery, i haven't gotten to other libraries like yui or moo
[03:35:59] <hdon> maasha, sorry http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7ks/2/
[03:36:10] <hdon> maasha, that took a while cause i lost my work like four times :(
[03:36:13] <hdon> damn ^w
[03:36:14] <Cork> shwaiil: whats fn?
[03:36:32] <shwaiil> it's the name of this  function, just an example
[03:36:46] <maasha> hdon: neat. let me study this.
[03:36:48] <Cork> ah you're defining it after the call
[03:36:58] <shwaiil> oh yeah sorry
[03:37:01] <hdon> maasha, yes please check out this especially http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:37:22] <Cork> ?eval var fn = function(name, fn){ if (name == 'Michael') { return fn; } } fn('Michael', function(name){ console.log('say hello to ' + name) })();
[03:37:26] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[03:37:42] <Cork> ?eval var fn = function(name, fn){ if (name == 'Michael') { return fn; } }; fn('Michael', function(name){ console.log('say hello to ' + name) })();
[03:37:44] <bot-t> Cork: "say hello to undefined"
[03:37:53] <hdon> maasha, oh, you can get rid of "console.info"
[03:38:04] <Cork> ?eval var fn = function(name, fn){ if (name == 'Michael') { return fn; } }; fn('Michael', function(name){ console.log('say hello to ' + name) })('test');
[03:38:04] <bot-t> Cork: "say hello to test"
[03:38:27] <shwaiil> hum thanks! I'll study this = D
[03:39:01] <Do``> Cork: come to think of it, the problem is not with my event listener, because in IE8, the jquery bind stuff doesn't work either
[03:39:15] <Do``> so there's something wrong with the way i create and dispatch the event
[03:39:25] <Do``> if jquery doesn't recognize it
[03:39:41] <Cork> Do``: jqeury isolate its event handling almost entirely now days
[03:39:53] <Jee5us_w> Hi! Has anyone over here delt with cros-domain requests that are masked as jsonp requests? I tryed a few methods and the console gives me an invalid lable error but from the network side i can acctually see the json response.
[03:39:55] <Cork> just cause the native dom event handling is so slow
[03:40:05] <maasha> hdon: thanks. I gotta go for a while, and will be back to study this further.
[03:40:13] <hdon> maasha, ok good lcuk :)
[03:40:24] <Do``> Cork: does that mean a native event has just about no way to be caught by an event handler?
[03:40:32] <Do``> hm that's weird
[03:40:33] <Cork> Jee5us_w: you can't send json if its to be jsonp
[03:40:42] <Cork> Jee5us_w: it needs to be a function that returns the json
[03:40:57] <karstenk1977_> Hello!
[03:41:01] <dns-away> hi
[03:41:39] <Cork> Jee5us_w: like => function <?php echo $_GET['callback']() { return { "json":"data" }; }
[03:41:43] <Cork> opps
[03:41:47] <karstenk1977_> is it possible to stop or delete a function with jQuery?
[03:41:49] <Cork> Jee5us_w: like => function <?php echo $_GET['callback']; ?>() { return { "json":"data" }; }
[03:42:14] <dns-away> what you want to say
[03:42:27] <Cork> karstenk1977_: not stop, as you can't process anything while a function runs (its single threaded)
[03:42:40] <Cork> karstenk1977_: remove happens when you remove all references to the function
[03:42:49] <Jee5us_w> Cork, but isn't there any way to capture the network response. I can acctyally see the json, but I can't handle it in a logical way.
[03:43:07] <Cork> Jee5us_w: if you get json, its blocked by the browser
[03:43:22] <Cork> Jee5us_w: the network call happens but the browser blocks it
[03:43:37] <Jee5us_w> Cork, thanks. I'll see what I can do then.
[03:43:38] <Cork> (well it happens in modern browsers)
[03:44:20] <Cork> Jee5us_w: in modern browsers you can send a cors header from the server to allow the call
[03:44:35] <Cork> but ie<10 doens't support it
[03:45:56] <shwaiil> ?eval var fn = function(name, fn){ if (name == 'Michael') { return fn; } }; var otherFn = function(name){ console.log('say hello to ' + name) }; fn('Michael', otherFn('test'));
[03:45:58] <bot-t> shwaiil: "say hello to test"
[03:53:20] <WingmaN> Thanks for the information about of JSONP.
[03:53:39] <Jee5us_w> Cork, what do you mean by "vors header" ?
[03:53:42] <Jee5us_w> cors*
[04:01:19] <Heather_> could someone take a look a this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13350022/best-way-to-declare-and-collect-data and see if you could help me?
[04:04:42] <maasha> hdon: ah, its only partly working. only the last child is toggled.
[04:05:23] <maasha> hdon: something with :last-child I guess.
[04:05:42] <hdon> maasha, that is something i am not experiencing, if i take your meaning correctly
[04:06:22] <hdon> maasha, when i click any node in your taxonomy, for instance Verrucomicrobia, then all of its children toggle, in this case "Methylacidiphilae" and "Methylaicdiphilales"
[04:06:29] <maasha> hdon: when I click on Bacteria, only the Chloroflexi node is folding.
[04:06:57] <hdon> maasha, ohh, duh, you're right. i know how to fix that
[04:07:55] <hdon> maasha, i assume you guessed already to remove ':last-child'
[04:08:00] <hdon> maasha, so it just says .children()
[04:08:25] <hdon> maasha, http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7ks/3/
[04:08:39] <shwaiil> Q: Developing a mobile website. There's a image slider with two navigation buttons slide Left and Right on top of the main slide images. In the android browser I need to tap once in the image before I can slide. Is there a way to fix this ? Maybe I can focus (not sure if the right term) to that element or something ?!
[04:08:46] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking!
[04:08:55] <maasha> hdon: that did the trick. neat.
[04:09:22] <hdon> shwaiil, of course there is a way. are you looking for a prepackaged solution?
[04:10:00] <shwaiil> hdon: tks for looking! no, actually just like to fix mine, this works but in android right now, sometimes I need to tap once, so I can slide
[04:10:18] <shwaiil> otherwise it's like the browser won't recognize the event "swipe"
[04:10:24] <shwaiil> and won't run the slide
[04:11:44] <hdon> maasha, oh, if you go back to this earlier version: http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7ks/2/ you can probably fix your bug by just adding ev.preventDefault() and return false to your .click() handler
[04:16:32] <maasha> hdon: right. I need to study preventDefault() as well. Looking at on() now.
[04:17:15] <hdon> maasha, remove preventDefault() and return false from my code and watch your console. you'll see that the event "bubbles" through several DOM nodes, trigger for each one of them.
[04:18:22] <hdon> maasha, consider that if you have an image that you want to behave a certain way when you "mouseover," but you also want to behave a certain way when you mouseover an <a> element. what do you do if you mouseover an <img> that is inside an <a> element? the browser solves this with "bubbling" but you can suppress this behavior when you know it is not needed
[04:18:27] <maasha> hdon: yes, that resembles the behaviour I was seeing originally.
[04:20:18] <maasha> hdon: I did an early version without jQuery where I got it to work just fine with changing the class of the clicked div - using the class to read the state. This is much more elegant though.
[04:21:02] <hdon> maasha, it sometimes happens that the tools available to us are a good fit to our goals :)
[04:21:02] <toxz> in opera i with $(window).height(); i get not the viewport height... (like i do with window.innerHeight)  what i'm doing wrong?
[04:33:51] <danmichel> How do I delay a div for a specified amount of time instead of onload?
[04:34:01] <jrodl3r> setTimeout()
[04:34:32] <jrodl3r> or.. if you're doing an animation… FadeOut(…).delay(x)
[04:35:01] <danmichel> $('#featured').orbit().setTimeout(10000).fadeIn(10000); jrodl3r?
[04:35:14] <jrodl3r> no. use delay
[04:35:25] <jrodl3r> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[04:35:27] <LordThumper> $("div").on("load", function () { $(this).hide(); setTimeout(function () { $(this).show(); }, 5000) })
[04:35:30] <LordThumper> Something like that
[04:36:19] <danmichel> thanks
[04:36:59] <LordThumper> never used delay
[04:37:11] <LordThumper> so you can $(this).hide().delay(5000).show()
[04:37:33] <jrodl3r> delay only works on jQ animations
[04:37:39] <LordThumper> oh I see
[04:37:39] <jrodl3r> or.. with
[04:37:55] <jrodl3r> setTimeout is what you'll prob want to use everywhere else
[04:38:00] <danmichel> http://pastie.org/5371362 ?
[04:38:18] <LordThumper> Let me make you a jsfiddle
[04:38:19] <LordThumper> one sec
[04:38:27] <jrodl3r> use codepen.io  ; )
[04:38:33] <danmichel> thanks
[04:41:25] <danmichel> LordThumper are you still making the jsfiddle? http://theplural.com/
[04:42:14] <danmichel> LordThumper http://pastebin.com/mT95Ckdp
[04:42:32] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/VgV6Q/
[04:43:05] <danmichel> ok, thanks. ill try it
[04:44:45] <danmichel> i get the concept, but its driving me nuts trying to  get orbit to do this. is there any way you can fit my code into it LordThumper?
[04:45:10] <LordThumper> If you make me a demo in jsfiddle I can help you
[04:46:31] <danmichel> the div containing #featured which is my slider on http://theplural.com is #home_conta , so would it be like this? http://pastie.org/5371396
[04:47:19] <danmichel> ok, I'm going to attempt that but it will take me a long while. will you be here in 10 minutes LordThumper?
[04:47:34] <jrodl3r> pass $el in
[04:47:36] <jrodl3r> ?
[04:51:15] <danmichel> LordThumper http://jsfiddle.net/VgV6Q/1/
[04:56:12] <LordThumper> danmichel: What do you want to delay exactly?
[04:57:19] <danmichel> i want to delay the loading of whatever is in #home_conta until the page has loaded or delay it from loading http://varmag.com/
[04:58:07] <danmichel> either loading the second and third images in my slider only after the page has fully loaded. Another option would be not to load anything in the div containing the slider at all until the page has fully loaded and the images within that div have fully loaded.
[04:58:09] <LordThumper> ok
[04:58:15] <danmichel> I tried LazyLoad for the slider images before, but it only conflicted with the slider's 'slide left' effect http://varmag.com/
[04:59:40] <LordThumper> Wait
[04:59:56] <LordThumper> You want to delay the loading of the resources (pics etc) ?
[05:00:01] <jrodl3r> http://codepen.io/JRodl3r/pen/BcEAy
[05:00:03] <LordThumper> As in from the network?
[05:00:22] <LordThumper> Or just hide them
[05:00:26] <LordThumper> And show them after the delay?
[05:00:37] <danmichel> yes LordThumper. I'm trying for faster load time so I'm basically trying to asynchronously load the slider
[05:01:07] <LordThumper> PHP?
[05:01:28] <LordThumper> Well whatever you are using server-side
[05:01:43] <danmichel> php, yes
[05:01:43] <LordThumper> You need to get the content using Ajax
[05:02:27] <LordThumper> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[05:03:04] <LordThumper> Make a page containing the content you need
[05:03:12] <LordThumper> Then send the request after the delay
[05:03:24] <LordThumper> Or when the page has fully loaded
[05:03:31] <haxerguise> hi guise
[05:03:36] <LordThumper> Or you can just put the content at the bottom of the page
[05:03:39] <LordThumper> So it gets loaded last
[05:03:56] <Trisox> or when the page turns in to mila kunis!
[05:04:00] <Trisox> how hot is that
[05:04:20] <Trisox> ;)
[05:07:02] <danmichel> LordThumper putting the code at the bottom of the page would still give the page the same load time http://pastie.org/5371486
[05:10:27] <mooijk> the designer keeps adding this $('ul ul').hide(); $('ul ul ul').hide(); etc
[05:10:40] <mooijk> how do you make that a bit slicker?
[05:12:00] <basso_> Hi. I added elements to the DOM via appendTo(). Now I want to add click functionality to these elements. I'm using the live('click', function) for this. (query 1.5) The links work, but when I press them, they all return the same value.
[05:12:03] <basso_> 	for(var i=1; i<=bullet_amount; i++)
[05:12:04] <basso_> 	{				
[05:12:05] <basso_> 		$('<a id="bullet-'+i+'">'+i+' </a>').appendTo('#bullet-nav');
[05:12:07] <basso_> 		
[05:12:08] <basso_> 		px_amount = (i-1)*ratio*3450;
[05:12:10] <basso_> 		console.log(px_amount);
[05:12:11] <basso_> 		$("#bullet-"+i).live('click', function() {
[05:12:12] <basso_> 			console.log(px_amount);
[05:12:13] <basso_> 		});
[05:12:14] <basso_> 	}
[05:12:52] <basso_> and the value they return is the last value from the loop, where px_amount is calculated.
[05:14:58] <basso_> it always return the highest value px_amount can have, I mean, so from the last iteration.
[05:15:31] <basso_> and all links that I have made an assignment to have this value.
[05:17:41] <danmichel> LordThumper how can i wrap this in setimeout rather than 'sleep' http://pastie.org/5371526
[05:19:29] <Cork> setTimeout(function() { $('#featured').orbit(); }, 5000)
[05:19:47] <jrodl3r> heh
[05:27:14] <crooksey_> If I am using DnD between multiple tables, what would be the best way to get the tableid into a hidden field for each table row?

[05:39:09] <Timz> Hi, I want to use the jquery-ui addClass/toggleClass extensions only. When I download only the effects core, it doesn't work. When I download the core + effects core it doesn't work neither. What part of jquery-ui is needed to make the addClass/toggleClass extensions work?
[05:39:39] <natrixnatrix89> I have a problem. I have a simple ajax POST request (same domain).. and it works just fine on all browsers.. even IE7
[05:39:39] <natrixnatrix89> But I tested on IE9 (with chromeframe) and it doesn't include cookies in the request header.. and this breaks functionality for my app.
[05:39:39] <natrixnatrix89> Is there a way to explicitly setup to include cookies?
[05:42:54] <lathan> ?hi
[05:42:54] <bot-t> Hey lathan
[05:43:09] <natrixnatrix89> ?hi
[05:43:09] <bot-t> Hey natrixnatrix89
[05:43:24] <lathan> ?anyone
[05:43:25] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[05:44:30] <toxz> why $(window).height(); doesnt work right in opera?
[05:49:58] <lathan> ?doesn't work @ toxz
[05:49:58] <bot-t> toxz, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[05:50:18] <toxz> it gives the wrong value
[05:50:41] <toxz> but but i see its a problem for jquery <= 1.2.6. :-/
[05:50:56] <tra> does jquery take "tap"-event into account? i would like to make my rollover menu work better with ios browsers
[05:51:57] <toxz> http://twigstechtips.blogspot.com/2010/02/jquery-window-height-given-wrong-value.html
[05:53:27] <lathan> toxz, well, why are you using jQuery <= 1.2.6? that is ancient?
[05:53:36] <toxz> i know
[05:53:44] <toxz> but our website is really big
[05:53:47] <lathan> and that blog has a hack in it......
[05:54:12] <toxz> yeah - im not sure if i will use it
[05:54:32] <lathan> toxz, you can add a plugin / extend the height function
[05:55:03] <toxz> i think i will reject the task instead of extending anything in the core
[05:55:33] <lathan> toxz, you could just put in a line of your own code after including jQuery that says:
[05:55:33] <lathan> jQuery.fn.height = (and steal the func from 1.2.6, http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.2.6&fn=jQuery.fn.height)
[05:55:44] <lathan> manually include the new versino of height
[05:55:59] <NielsNL> hello all, i'm working on a seatmap editor using selectable Interaction, but in some case the items i select are not the once i try to select. please have a look here: http://edgy.fusionticket.org/pmp/ not sure of i do something wrong.
[05:56:10] <toxz> lathan - thx
[05:56:14] <lathan> ?np
[05:56:15] <bot-t> No Problem
[05:56:20] <toxz> lathan - i will think about it
[05:57:08] <lathan> tra, jQuery will work with any events, both native and custom. however, i have no personal experience developing with touch screen devices.

[06:15:55] <xrdodrx> <span id="story"><p>Paragraph one</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></span> would become "Paragraph one\nParagraph two"

[06:51:22] <pedda> i'm trying to display captions when a user hovers the approprieate image
[06:51:27] <pedda> which works
[06:51:51] <pedda> but if the user hovers the caption as well it disappears, because there is no hover over the image anymore
[06:52:38] <pedda> the captions are fade in right in front of the image
[06:52:53] <pedda> ther're overlaying the image basically
[06:54:23] <thomas_r> NielsNL: what is it called?
[06:55:05] <DarsVaeda> what function can I use to know if the user clicked into an input field ?
[06:56:12] <DarsVaeda> ah nevermind, stupid firefox -.-

[07:04:32] <yousaf> Thanks LordThumper, it works fine on JSFiddle though
[07:04:37] <yousaf> changing now
[07:05:03] <yousaf> still doesn't work
[07:05:12] <yousaf> changed to

[07:08:34] <LordThumper> Can't seem to find other mistakes
[07:10:23] <LordThumper> what is document.URL?

[07:14:06] <ShawnRisk> how come the arrow button with Click Now is clickable: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/20/ but on my dev site this is not clickable at all?  If you want I can paste the full code in pastebin because I am using some php.
[07:19:27] <pedda> how to write this properly: 'padding': vertPadding + 'px ' + horPadding 'px', ?
[07:19:46] <pedda> meaning: myObj.css({'padding': vertPadding + 'px ' + horPadding 'px',});
[07:20:05] <Brodingo> pedda can you use a class?
[07:20:26] <pedda> no
[07:20:36] <pedda> that's why i add it by jquery
[07:20:46] <pedda> vertPadding + 'px ' + horPadding 'px' is not parsed properly
[07:20:49] <Brodingo> you cant add a class?
[07:21:11] <pedda> i can, but the padding is different everytime
[07:21:43] <pedda> sure i can add a class.. addClass('myClass'); but this doesn't solve my issue :)
[07:21:51] <Brodingo> theres a trailer comma there
[07:21:59] <Brodingo> trailing*
[07:22:02] <pedda> indeed
[07:22:13] <pedda> there are some declarations before and after this arguent
[07:22:23] <pedda> just copy pasted it to the chan
[07:22:41] <pedda> it's only about the doubled  arguments for padding
[07:22:52] <pedda> vertPadding + 'px' works fine
[07:23:08] <pedda> and adds a padding equal to vertPadding to all sides
[07:23:26] <pedda> but if i need horizontal AND vertical it breaks
[07:23:54] <pedda> because it expects something like 'key': 'value'
[07:24:10] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[07:24:39] <pedda> and not 'key': myVar + 'valPartOne ' + myVar2 + 'valPartTwo'
[07:26:53] <thomas_r> is there a low-level "lightbox" within ui? or do i need to use a separate plugin?
[07:29:34] <kapitan> Is it possible to stop the crhome or ff debuggers when the value of a variable is changed?
[07:29:49] <ShawnRisk> hi NoiseEee

[07:33:52] <Cork> ugg...
[07:34:53] <Cork> ShawnRisk: have you checked so the selector works?
[07:35:44] <ShawnRisk> Cork: pardon?
[07:35:50] <Cork> ShawnRisk: and have you checked so you don't cover the button with a transparent element?
[07:36:25] <Cork> ah, no the link isn't js related at all (scratch the first comment)
[07:36:45] <Cork> but for me some of the links is covered by other li elements
[07:37:12] <ShawnRisk> Cork: you mean covered by callto div?

[07:37:50] <auska> Hi! Does anyone knows about any jquery plugin that shows a loading spin while the page hadn't finished loading and the page content when finished? Thank!
[07:38:09] <Cork> ShawnRisk: but its better if you just check on your site
[07:38:09] <ShawnRisk> Cork: you are looking at the arrow that says Click Now right?
[07:38:14] <Cork> yes
[07:38:40] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if it is the problem i talked about it should be fairly easy to see
[07:39:04] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I am checking my site but it is not working for me, and I think it is because of the callto div.  Do you want me to sent you everything over so you can check on the site?

[07:47:59] <stew2> okay so I want a link to show that it is selected by changing the background image and for some reason this is provin to be a bit annoying

[07:48:17] <stew2> thats my code
[07:48:32] <stew2> when it clicks it stays there for two seconds then goes away
[07:48:37] <stew2> ...why?
[07:49:30] <NoiseEee> stew2: never paste code in channel.  thats what pastebins are for

[07:58:29] <aqeel> hi room
[07:59:51] <BillCriswell> Hi.
[08:01:35] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to figure out why my responseXML is always null (it should have a true or false). Any ideas why? http://pastebin.com/QaT0WB5b
[08:05:58] <xec_> Wolf_22: what is responseXML?
[08:06:25] <xec_> do you mean the data object in the success callback?
[08:07:20] <Wolf_22> xec_: Sure. Basically, I'm just trying to get SOMETHING back from that web service I'm submitting against. Every time I look in Firebug, I just don't see anything making me believe it's working 100% because I don't see anything like "True" or "False" as indicated by that URL's API doc.
[08:07:27] <fonko> hey guys
[08:07:27] <BillCriswell> Wolf_22: I think you want console.log(data) in the success callback.
[08:07:38] <fonko> im having some issues with $('#'+target).css("background-position",  "0 0");
[08:07:43] <recurse> coldhead: youll be delighted to know ive got it sorta working. http://pastebin.com/xb0QLUsR - i went with your suggestion of appendTo to a container div, hiding the original results. The problem im having is now appenTo keeps, well, appending my Ajax results with my toggling of that sort feature. Any suggestions to prevent the repeat appending would be good. I tried to encapsulate my click function in a one() function, but that preve
[08:07:45] <fonko> is not working in iexplorer, any ideas?
[08:08:11] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/xmzMe/
[08:08:11] <xec_> Wolf_22: are you able to see the http request being done in firebug?
[08:08:28] <BillCriswell> Wolf_22: You don't want to do request = $.ajax(); you just want to do $.ajax() and run what you need in the success callback.
[08:09:38] <aqeel> recurse make use of one()
[08:09:53] <recurse> i tried that aqeel, as you may have read
[08:10:04] <recurse>  I tried to encapsulate my click function in a one() function, but that prevented me from toggling.
[08:10:11] <xec_> BillCriswell: well, the var is appropriately named at least :) i agree it doesn't make much sense to console.log() it, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it either
[08:10:36] <aqeel> use toggle out of one() ans appendTO within one
[08:11:09] <recurse> but my toggle is a toggle('active') class addtion
[08:11:14] <recurse> inside my click event
[08:11:38] <recurse> it wont fire more then once becuase of one .. you're saying toggle outside the click event, but ... how is that logicially possible?
[08:11:59] <recurse> http://pastebin.com/xb0QLUsR
[08:14:30] <recurse> is there a way for me to detect children appended and remove() those?
[08:14:50] <recurse> or remove what i just lloaded?
[08:14:58] <ShawnRisk> what is wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/9Z7Rimci  All I want to do is an if statement that shows the html based on if the id exists or not.  Any ideas?
[08:16:01] <xec_> fonko: that should work, depending on what "target" is
[08:16:26] <xec_> fonko: http://jsfiddle.net/pBgf2/
[08:17:11] <vedder_> hey guys.. why im not getting the correct result in my total field once i add a second row.. i mean if i add a quantity value and PUs/imp i can get the total only with the first row.. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/xVdYv/
[08:17:37] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a built-in function to search an object for a particular value? ie. test if '2' exists in {foo: 'bar', one: '2', three: 'four'}
[08:19:06] <systemfault> timwis: No, you must iterate on the keys to find it yourself.
[08:19:16] <timwis> okay thanks systemfault
[08:19:23] <xec_> ShawnRisk: i don't see anything wrong with it, apart from not knowing what "body" is, and if it is the <body>, it's probably a bad idea to overwrite the entire contents :)
[08:19:40] <ShawnRisk> xec_: I fixed this but it is not working correctly
[08:19:48] <xec_> you fixed what?
[08:20:45] <fonko> xec_, its wokring but in ie shows a different image
[08:21:15] <fonko> also, im using a span tag
[08:21:16] <fonko> not a div
[08:21:46] <zfly9> Hey guys i have two scripts using Live Query, both of them only work when the page is loaded by clicking a link, but if I load the page via refresh, neither of the elements work, any ideas?
[08:21:47] <xec_> fonko: does the demo i posted work in IE?
[08:22:03] <fonko> xec_, it does but shows a different picture than firefox
[08:22:05] <jholloman> does anyone have experience configuring jqGrids? I have a grid which if I manually set the size for the columns they don't fill up the page. So I use ShrinkToFit: true to fill the void and it causes a horizontal scrollbar within the grid now (Unable to jsfiddle this, it's a very large and complex grid unfortunately)
[08:22:07] <fonko> also, if you use a span tag
[08:22:11] <fonko> it wont work
[08:22:23] <xec_> fonko: yes you can't set a height on an inline element
[08:22:37] <fonko> mmm... good
[08:22:38] <xec_> fonko: and the image is a placeholder
[08:22:47] <fonko> i will try to set a height then
[08:22:52] <fonko> thx sr
[08:23:10] <xec_> fonko: a span is an inline element.
[08:23:41] <vedder_> any help
[08:23:56] <xec_> fonko: if you want to set a height you can make it display: block; or display: inline-block; or change it to a div
[08:24:09] <tplaner_> do jquery objects have some sort of uid?
[08:26:08] <dabear> tplaner_: kinda
[08:26:28] <ShawnRisk> xec_: what is wrong with this line of code: $('h3.f-left').html('<a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>'); I think it has to do with the quotes but can't figure out what.
[08:27:49] <dabear> tplaner_: jQuery.expando
[08:27:56] <dabear> might or might not be what you want
[08:28:13] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: do you need to echo the_title() or does that happen automatically?
[08:28:20] <xec_> fonko: please read the messages i wrote to you
[08:28:22] <tlkr> guys, I have a draggable object which is resized from 200px to 50px in my start function. When dragging the object it still behaves as if it was the size that it was when it was picked up. Any ideas on how to fix this?
[08:28:49] <xec_> fonko: crap, i was scrolled up, ignore that last thing, i thought you just said the same thing again, lol
[08:29:17] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: Your code looks find quotation wise.
[08:29:40] <xec_> ShawnRisk: what does the PHP generate?
[08:30:05] <NoiseEee> ?php @ ShawnRisk
[08:30:06] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.

[08:31:13] <xec_> ShawnRisk: there's still php there, dude
[08:31:13] <zfly9> menu = form
[08:31:19] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: Oh man.
[08:31:35] <ShawnRisk> yes I know there is php there, but it is a jquery question :)
[08:31:39] <NoiseEee> ?php @ ShawnRisk
[08:31:40] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[08:31:42] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: You can't put this inside the element you're trying to write to.
[08:32:03] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: oh
[08:32:38] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: what should I do?
[08:33:20] <xec_> ShawnRisk: without knowing what the code really looks like (the OUTPUT of the PHP), how are we supposed to know what it does
[08:33:34] <xec_> ShawnRisk: re-read the message from bot-t
[08:33:38] <EdwardIII> hrm chaps any idea how i can pull out a category's image? googled tons, but just can't figure out why this isn't giving me *something* like an image url: https://gist.github.com/38272c1be0b6b480bf97
[08:33:49] <BillCriswell> xec_: Make sure you look at the console for errors.
[08:33:49] <EdwardIII> seems like something really simple, just cannot figure out why it isn't working
[08:34:10] <xec_> ShawnRisk: secondly - separate your javascript from your markup
[08:34:13] <xec_> BillCriswell: what?
[08:34:22] <ShawnRisk> xec_: okay thanks
[08:34:24] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: This is #jquery.
[08:35:08] <BillCriswell> xec_: Meant to say ShawnRisk.
[08:35:16] <xec_> ah
[08:35:21] <ShawnRisk> I get it
[08:35:28] <BillCriswell> The letters are like right next to eachother xec_.
[08:35:35] <xec_> i know, right
[08:37:34] <ShawnRisk> the same title is printed out each time
[08:37:40] <ShawnRisk> in the php code
[08:37:52] <xec_> great. paste the html?
[08:38:18] <ShawnRisk> <h3 class="f-left" style="width:550px"><a href="http://totallyadddev.com/a-body-double-helps-you-zip-through-paperwork/">A Body Double Helps You Zip Through Paperwork</a></h3>
[08:39:01] <xec_> in a pastebin. with the script.
[08:39:10] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: What are you trying to accomplish? I think you're overcomplicating things.
[08:39:26] <xec_> like you did last time, only this time without php.
[08:39:28] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: I am just trying to print out the title
[08:39:41] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: and this is related to jquery how?
[08:39:46] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: Why do you need the javascript at all?
[08:40:04] <zfly9> Anyone?
[08:40:54] <xec_> zfly9: do you get any errors in console?
[08:41:11] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: ah, channel malfunction, sorry!
[08:41:13] <zfly9> xec_ no
[08:41:31] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: I'll let it slide this time, Chief!
[08:41:31] <tlkr> guys, I have a draggable object which is resized from 200px to 50px in my start function. When dragging the object it still behaves as if it was the size that it was when it was picked up. Any ideas on how to fix this?
[08:41:40] <BillCriswell> Next time you won't be so luck!
[08:41:43] <BillCriswell> lucky*
[08:42:16] <xec_> zfly9: what browser? in chrome i keep getting "Cannot call method 'create' of undefined"
[08:43:11] <EdwardIII> heh
[08:43:18] <zfly9> xec_ I see that too but it seems to be related to my MeasureIt plugin in Chrome
[08:43:59] <xec_> oh lol, i got that too - that's interesting
[08:44:36] <zfly9> in firefox I don't get anything haha
[08:44:48] <BillCriswell> Looking at scripts Incognito are good for sanity checks. =)
[08:45:01] <BillCriswell> Assuming you don't run plugins Incognito.
[08:45:56] <xec_> yes, good idea BillCriswell
[08:46:21] <xec_> indeed seems to be unrelated to the issue, sometimes i get the slider, sometimes not
[08:46:54] <xec_> zfly9: where is the jquery code at?
[08:47:01] <zfly9> footer
[08:47:18] <NoiseEee> tlkr: don't initialize it until the resize finishes?
[08:47:19] <rabbite> what's a good way of verifying <input type="radio" name="payment_method" value="paypal" checked> is checked in jQuery?
[08:47:24] <rabbite> it's not a value...
[08:48:03] <NoiseEee> rabbite: its a... property
[08:48:03] <pachet> $('input[name="payment_method"]).is('checked')
[08:48:12] <CodesStuff> rabbite: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/426258/how-do-i-check-a-checkbox-with-jquery-or-javascript
[08:48:15] <pachet> er, :checked rather
[08:48:15] <rabbite> ahhh nice
[08:48:24] <Xtrivity> If you are clicking on an element <div id="test" class="active"> is there a way to get the id "test" by selecting the "active" class?
[08:48:25] <CodesStuff> Everyone suggests using .prop
[08:48:44] <CodesStuff> Xtrivity: $(this) in the click cb
[08:48:51] <CodesStuff> $(this).attr(id);
[08:48:55] <xec_> Xtrivity: this.id
[08:49:01] <Xtrivity> doesn't work because i'm not clicking on that element.
[08:49:10] <Xtrivity> ahh let me re.explain.
[08:49:21] <CodesStuff> Oh, so it's dynamic content then
[08:49:46] <CodesStuff> Assign a data-attribute to it, then fetch the data-attrribute that has it generated
[08:49:53] <CodesStuff> use that as the identifier for the ID you want
[08:49:57] <Xtrivity> not dynamic
[08:49:58] <Xtrivity> one sec.
[08:50:06] <xec_> CodesStuff: i think he means he's clicking something else entirely
[08:50:12] <CodesStuff> Ruh roh.
[08:50:14] <NoiseEee> Xtrivity: var arrayOfElementsWithTheClassActive = $('.active');
[08:50:29] <HyShai> if an element's visibility is changed, does the 'load' event fire?
[08:50:29] <aqeel> recurse....http://jsfiddle.net/xmzMe/4/
[08:50:40] <NoiseEee> HyShai: nope why would it
[08:50:53] <tlkr> NoiseEee, do you mean prior to initialising the .draggable object?
[08:50:57] <NoiseEee> tlkr: yes
[08:51:02] <Xtrivity> click on element <div id="test"> and you have <div id="iwantthis" class="currently-active"> .. i want the id "iwantthis"
[08:51:15] <aqeel> now where the code that is adding the data...you add, removeClass('added')
[08:51:17] <xec_> zfly9: what do you mean by footer? end of the html page? what am i looking for, what part isn't working
[08:51:17] <HyShai> NoiseEee: i agree with you, just getting behavior like that from IE
[08:51:22] <NoiseEee> Xtrivity: please pastebin markup
[08:51:38] <tlkr> NoiseEee, I want it to resize when the dragging starts however, I need it to be a certain size until dragging starts, which is when I want to resize it. So it can be dropped into smaller targets.
[08:51:45] <aqeel> recurse are you there?
[08:52:02] <xec_> Xtrivity: is there only one element with the class .currently-active?
[08:52:17] <CodesStuff> This channel gets so unorganized sometimes :\
[08:52:47] <xec_> Xtrivity: if so, a simple $(".currently-active").attr("id"); would do the trick
[08:53:07] <zfly9> xec_ nothin
[08:53:09] <zfly9> ?
[08:53:26] <Xtrivity> xec_: http://pastebin.com/TjDhPiHq
[08:53:36] <Xtrivity> I tried what you said and it didn't work.
[08:54:19] <Xtrivity> xec_: oh jeeeze. forgot the "" for the (id)

[08:57:47] <dabear> sadfds: sure
[08:57:56] <dabear> just select it and .hide() it
[08:58:56] <sadfds> so i have a label which contains the name of the logged in user. so if it is not empty, the button must be hidden
[09:00:12] <sadfds> the label is in a ascx control
[09:00:21] <sadfds> how can i access the control from jquery
[09:00:33] <zfly9> xec_ yes towards bottom of html
[09:00:35] <dabear> what button? http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ tells you how to manipulate buttons
[09:00:48] <dabear> sadfds: ascx?
[09:01:01] <sadfds> the button which loads in the jquery ui dialog
[09:01:05] <xec_> sadfds: how would you select it with css if you wanted to color it or something? does it have an ID or classname?
[09:01:19] <sadfds> dabear: aspx usercontrol
[09:01:23] <xec_> dabear: ascx is asp.net i believe
[09:01:27] <dabear> ok
[09:01:39] <dabear> why would it matter what serverside language you used?
[09:01:52] <dabear> so if its an ascx control or not is irrelevant
[09:02:34] <xec_> true. but asp.net webforms does its best to keep developers from knowing anything about web development
[09:02:38] <sadfds> i just want to acces the label
[09:02:51] <xec_> </rant>
[09:02:51] <dabear> ?demo @ sadfds
[09:02:52] <bot-t> sadfds, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:02:57] <sadfds> it has the id = lblLogin
[09:03:03] <dabear> sadfds: or tell us exactly what the problem is
[09:03:07] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/6SRj5/
[09:03:16] <xec_> sadfds: does it have that ID in the generated HTML as well?
[09:03:33] <aqeel> how can i encapsulate it within window.load, to stop the spinner
[09:03:42] <sadfds> ok 1. I´ve a jquery ui dialog version 1.9....
[09:04:12] <sadfds> when user hit the button the dialog pop up
[09:04:35] <sadfds> in it is a button to, which must be hidden, if the label is not emtpy
[09:05:00] <xec_> sadfds: do you mind if I PM you?
[09:05:23] <sadfds> xec_: no problem
[09:05:45] <aqeel> anyone....
[09:06:37] <draginx> Is there anyway to see if the user closed the window?
[09:07:01] <draginx> not cxlicked on a link and changed the page
[09:07:08] <NoiseEee> draginx: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[09:07:13] <NoiseEee> draginx: not specifically closing, no
[09:07:17] <draginx> hmm
[09:07:21] <draginx> well this is a problem :/
[09:07:27] <NoiseEee> ... with your architecture
[09:07:40] <draginx> not mine
[09:07:52] <aqeel> you see contents are being loaded into <object> via html and i would like to know the load is completed indeed
[09:09:01] <xec_> NoiseEee++
[09:09:05] <NoiseEee> aqeel: http://api.jquery.com/load/  see "callback function"
[09:09:23] <aqeel> well actually you can  draginx
[09:09:32] <draginx> how so?
[09:09:43] <xec_> sadfds: did you get my messages?
[09:09:47] <aqeel> i used but not working gfor the contetn being loaded into object tag
[09:10:34] <aqeel> the window closed is it main window
[09:10:46] <aqeel> index.html?
[09:11:14] <aqeel> draginx
[09:11:23] <draginx> main window
[09:11:41] <sadfds> xec_: one sec
[09:12:22] <aqeel> but won't work for all browsers and yes you will be notified...
[09:14:08] <aqeel> in ie open jailbreak.webege.com and press esc after clicking ok
[09:14:24] <NoiseEee> aqeel: what are you going on about?
[09:14:27] <aqeel> but firfox wont work
[09:14:41] <aqeel> index page can be closed via javascript
[09:14:50] <NoiseEee> thats not what he asked f
[09:15:03] <NoiseEee> he asked if you can tell if someone closed a browser window, as opposed to clicked a link
[09:15:16] <NoiseEee> and offering a non-cross browser "solution" in #jquery is pretty much useless
[09:15:18] <NoiseEee> but thanks
[09:15:19] <aqeel> and that is main page
[09:15:32] <aqeel> main page will usually give you alert message
[09:16:47] <aqeel> he can reopen his ndex .html and see if it was window.close()......or simply was a linkl

[09:25:08] <fonko> guys i have inputs with preset values, then i have a function that makes all input go blank when clicking, but if the user misspell something and goes back it will erase all the text
[09:25:23] <aqeel> got it
[09:25:31] <fonko> how can i erase only the first time the user clicks on a field?
[09:26:58] <lamaster> hey guys, how can i copy elements with predefined data attributes? clone(true) does not seem to  work
[09:28:43] <rabbite> god i love jQuery
[09:29:17] <rabbite> slideDown // slideUp is awesome and works exactly as it should :D
[09:30:43] <fonko> info fonko
[09:31:05] <abadr> I'm having trouble understanding the Deferred docs. Using `pipe`, or some other way, how do I make dfd2 wait for and copy the resolve/reject status of dfd1?
[09:31:19] <blommer> Is it better to Ajax json and render with jquery or Ajax HTML that has been rendered with server?
[09:32:11] <lamaster_> blommer:  it depends
[09:32:59] <blommer> I'm doing jquery mobile
[09:33:07] <fonko> how can i erase only the first time the user clicks on a field?
[09:33:17] <fonko> guys i have inputs with preset values, then i have a function that makes all input go blank when clicking, but if the user misspell something and goes back it will erase all the text
[09:33:19] <zfly9> Hey guys I have some issue where jquery items break on refresh http://goo.gl/YOtWM ... any ideas? There's full width slider at the top and a drop down menu being styled by jquery at the bottom footer menu
[09:33:22] <blommer> So will be primarily for phone/tablet
[09:33:38] <Jon47> fonko: look into using the placeholder attribute in html?
[09:33:51] <blommer> Json uncompressed is 350kB
[09:34:12] <fonko> i like that, thanks Jon47
[09:34:13] <dsyme> is it possible to append a value to an attribute? i.e. i have an href="users/delete/" and I want to append the id to it so it reads href="users/delete/id" without having to replace the whole value inside the href attribute
[09:34:15] <blommer> Currently I download entire json
[09:34:43] <blommer> And have a list view that displays 20 items at a time
[09:35:43] <blommer> And renders it
[09:35:57] <blommer> I'll make a fiddle it will be easier to explain
[09:39:30] <Jon47> fonko: it's not fully supported by all versions of every browser, so check the compatibility and polyfill it as you see fit.  there are some unit-tested, community maintained polyfills you can use so at least you don't have to worry about writing any new code and testing it
[09:39:43] <devone> can anyone experienced with jquery authoring give me some advice on getting prototypes to work
[09:41:29] <zfly9> ... actually those two jQuery items fail on refresh randomly
[09:41:40] <zfly9> there's other jQuery on the page that works on every refresh
[09:47:13] <tlkr> is there a way to make a function delay execution until the dom has been updated due to a .css() change on a particular element?
[09:47:53] <pifantastic> tlkr: why?
[09:48:47] <tlkr> I am resizing a draggable() element within the start option, however it is defining the dimensions of the draggable helper prior to the dom updating completing.
[09:49:01] <tlkr> pifantastic
[09:49:22] <devone> http://jsfiddle.net/ppnPp/ can someone recommend the best way to go about this? the guides don't really help so much
[09:49:28] <pifantastic> tlkr: you probably want to resize the draggable before you ever create it
[09:49:28] <Cork> tlkr: setTimeout(function() {}, 0); is a quite common solution
[09:50:29] <nsanden_> is setting/getting custom html attributes supported well, ive never used them really
[09:50:36] <tlkr> pifantastic, I can't do that because the size will vary and it cannot be known what size will be required prior to the drag actually being initiated.
[09:51:16] <NoiseEee> tlkr: just init after your resize call
[09:51:37] <pifantastic> devone: Ideally you would use widget factory
[09:51:55] <pifantastic> devone: http://jqueryui.com/widget/
[09:51:56] <tlkr> NoiseEee, I cannot init it after the resize call because the drag has already started. Unless you can think of a way of doing that?
[09:52:44] <tlkr> and Cork will the execution not continue within the current function and execute the timeout code after the defined delay ?
[09:53:13] <Cork> tlkr: yes
[09:53:24] <Cork> that's the only way
[09:53:49] <tlkr> but that will not work surely? as the function will continue execution with the incorrect size?
[09:53:50] <devone> pifantastic is there a difference with widget factory over jquery.fn?
[09:53:51] <Cork> tlkr: the js process has to stop so the browser can do a rendering sweep
[09:54:04] <sadfds> xec_: now the button is disabled
[09:54:10] <pifantastic> devone: the widget factory utilizes jquery.fn
[09:54:19] <Cork> tlkr: what needs the updated size needs to happen in the setTimeout
[09:54:51] <Cork> (the css change should happen before it)
[09:55:01] <tlkr> so start: setTimeout(function(), xxx) as an option?
[09:55:15] <Cork> no
[09:55:21] <Cork> whats start: ?
[09:55:29] <tlkr> start is an option of the draggable method.
[09:55:47] <Cork> do you need to return anything from your function?
[09:55:55] <Cork> (to the plugin)
[09:56:05] <tlkr> no
[09:56:17] <tlkr> however it is the start option so it runs prior to dragging being initiated.
[09:56:44] <Cork> start: function() { $().css(); setTimeout(function() { /* check the updated value */ }, 0); }
[09:57:21] <tlkr> I will try it Cork ty.
[09:57:56] <devone> pifantastic that looks like a widget wrapper function to group sections of code together
[09:59:13] <pifantastic> devone: it's for situations when you need more than just a single method for a plugin
[09:59:37] <pifantastic> devone: for isntance, $("div").mywidget(); $("div").mywidget("open");
[10:00:39] <antilove> hey is there any jquery plugins to proportionate the typography  nicely like paragraph margin-bottom line-heigh etc automatically ?
[10:00:54] <devone> and if i'm planning to build a small library that's still appropriate?
[10:01:33] <devone> jQuery.fn.wrapper.allmymethods vs widget.widgetmethod
[10:02:18] <rabbite> trying to call jQuery(document).onLoad(change_same_price());
[10:02:28] <rabbite> when the load event fires
[10:02:38] <rabbite> change_sample_price is a function
[10:02:52] <Cork> rabbite: remove the extra ()
[10:02:55] <rabbite> not sure if my syntax is incorrect here or the function hasn't been declared yet or what
[10:03:05] <Cork> jQuery(document).onLoad(change_same_price);
[10:03:19] <devone> if variable refers to function you are basically doing myFunc()()
[10:03:43] <rabbite> still not firing
[10:04:23] <Cork> rabbite: what is it you're trying to catch?
[10:04:29] <Cork> or rather when
[10:04:45] <Cork> on wait its load, not onload
[10:04:49] <rabbite> ahh
[10:05:00] <Cork> or .on('load'
[10:05:50] <rabbite> so jQuery(document).on('load', change_same_price);  ?
[10:05:59] * Cork nods
[10:06:36] <rabbite> damn, still not firing
[10:06:39] <pifantastic> devone: http://jsfiddle.net/MSkZZ/3/
[10:06:50] <Cork> rabbite: what is it you're trying to catch?
[10:06:52] <pifantastic> devone: taken from: http://jqueryui.com/widget/
[10:07:35] <rabbite> well, i have a price that's loading
[10:07:49] <Cork> its loading through ajax?
[10:07:51] <devone> pifantastic this looks kinda like PHP OOP
[10:07:56] <rabbite> nah javascript
[10:07:57] <rabbite> :D
[10:08:04] <rabbite> it's all rubber bands and duct tape at this point
[10:08:12] <pachet> ph poop
[10:08:16] <Cork> .load is triggered when the original page is loaded
[10:08:19] <pifantastic> devone: it's what jqueryui uses to implement more complicated stuff like dialogs
[10:08:24] <Cork> its never triggered after th first load
[10:08:27] <rabbite> yeah .load should work
[10:08:47] <rabbite> i only need it to call change_sample_price once, because the wrong price is loading first
[10:09:12] <rabbite> i've already tested in in .ready and it works, but .ready is too slow so the user can see the old price then it updates
[10:09:22] <Cork> rabbite: you mean the wrong price is in the html?
[10:09:50] <Cork> rabbite: ready triggers before .load
[10:09:56] <aqeel> hide old prices first then load then show
[10:10:11] <rabbite> does it? i thought ready waited until the entire page was loaded?
[10:10:19] <rabbite> maybe i have them backwards mentally
[10:10:48] <Cork> .ready triggers when the entire html file is loaded, parsed and the dom is constructed
[10:11:10] <aqeel> therefore flash of contents occur
[10:11:13] <devone> pifantastic, $.widget( "custom.cp3" what's the use of custom.cp3?
[10:11:15] <Cork> .load is triggered when the dom is constructed, all meda is loaded and rendered (images, and the like)
[10:11:30] <pifantastic> devone: it's a namespace
[10:11:39] <rabbite> Cork: ahh, that makes sense to me.
[10:12:30] <Cork> rabbite: only way to try to grab it earlier would be to put the js in the body right after the list
[10:12:39] <devone> pifantastic so it will bind to jQuery->custom->cp3 as opposed to jQuery->fn->cp3?
[10:12:45] <Cork> rabbite: or even better hide the data server side :)
[10:13:01] <pifantastic> devone: correct: http://jsfiddle.net/MSkZZ/4/
[10:13:27] <rabbite> i put it in .ready and it seems to be doing better. it's just a quick hack until we can work the pricing into a more permanent solution
[10:14:08] <devone> pifantastic is it possible to extend the widget further? $('#my-widget').cp3.x.y.z and so forth
[10:14:43] <nsanden_> how do i stuff data in my div, like <div data-date="$date" data-time="$time"> or <div id="$date|$time">  is the latter better supported?
[10:15:11] <Cork> nsanden_: never EVER add it in the id tag
[10:15:25] <Cork> data-* is fine
[10:15:35] <Zzaichik> .attr('data', date);
[10:15:37] <Brodingo> data-* is awesome
[10:15:50] <pifantastic> devone: maaaayybeeee, but why?
[10:15:52] <Brodingo> ?data
[10:16:01] <Brodingo> ahem
[10:16:02] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:16:19] <Cork> s/tag/attribute/
[10:16:29] <nsanden_> browser support is fine for data-*?
[10:16:32] <devone> pifantastic imagine a small prototypal API. then try to fit that inside jQuery wrapper, cp3 would be the namespace
[10:16:33] <Cork> yes
[10:16:40] <MistuhKurtz> there's a difference between the data-* attribute and jquery's data()
[10:17:01] <Cork> nsanden_: data- is just a standardization so that it won't conflict with future standards
[10:17:09] <Cork> nsanden_: browsers don't care
[10:17:14] <nsanden_> ok great
[10:17:28] <devone> that's why, imo, $('#foo').cp3.my.method(); makes more sense than $('#foo').cp3('mymethod',{});
[10:17:28] <Cork> (its a reserved namespace)
[10:17:41] <pifantastic> devone: it's just sugar
[10:18:01] <devone> what is?
[10:18:22] <pifantastic> devone: $('#foo').cp3.my.method(); <- how does method() have access to the element?
[10:18:36] <MistuhKurtz> ^
[10:18:38] <pachet> i would argue that .fn isn't the place to house complex data structures ;[
[10:18:45] <devone> well i can't do that when cp3->my loses jQuery when i return new constructor
[10:18:56] <pifantastic> devone: right, you can't do that
[10:19:32] <pifantastic> devone: in javascript, a function's scope is the object it is dereferenced from, so while $('#foo').cp3.my.method(); may "look" nice, it's not practical
[10:19:34] <devone> kinda defeats the point of constructorfoo.prototype={x:foo,y:bar}
[10:19:38] <Cork> ya, you would want to store that on a separate structure and call it from a function on fn instead
[10:19:50] <pachet> there's black magic you can do to retain the reference, but you shouldn't
[10:19:57] <Cork> the fn structure is copied each time you use jquery
[10:20:06] <devone> so what you are saying is i should never go beyond each (.) dot
[10:20:13] <pifantastic> no
[10:20:31] <devone> i can get it to work like: $('#foo').cp3().method();
[10:20:36] <devone> does that look better?
[10:20:37] <pifantastic> I'm saying you need to know how objects and functions work in javascript
[10:20:57] <pachet> as long as cp3 returns a jquery object :[
[10:21:14] <devone> well it does, methods would be: this.method=function() {}
[10:21:27] <devone> which isn't the best, but it's also how all the dumb tutorials recommend it
[10:21:33] <decottis> ciao
[10:21:41] <decottis> !list
[10:22:22] <Cork> devone: you should have an internal object, build your structure on it, and have a proxy function infront to access it
[10:22:39] <Cork> and only attach the proxy function to ,fn
[10:22:49] <devone> i understand how object/scope works btw. and i know why cp3.x.y.z won't work, i just don't understand WHY cp3.x.y.z() would be a bad thing, say from a debugging pov etc
[10:23:03] <pachet> its just bad form
[10:23:15] <devone> yes but "it just is" doesn't really answer why
[10:23:27] <MistuhKurtz> devone, I recommend reading through these different plugin patterns: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[10:23:40] <devone> god i read through that it took an hr
[10:23:46] <MistuhKurtz> you should read through it again
[10:23:53] <MistuhKurtz> I could stand to read through it like 3 more times
[10:23:54] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:24:01] <MistuhKurtz> it's a lot of material but it's dense with good stuff
[10:24:35] <pifantastic> devone: it's not that cp3.x.y.z() is a bad thing, it's that it would be a nightmare to make _work_
[10:24:35] <devone> the tl;dr was they did equivilent of $('#foo').cp3().x();
[10:24:46] <MistuhKurtz> which pattern did that devone?
[10:24:52] <MistuhKurtz> because that article covers many different approaches
[10:25:11] <devone> private function or smth
[10:25:15] <MistuhKurtz> and each pattern has links to ~4-5 more articles on that pattern
[10:25:15] <devone> i want that too
[10:25:29] <MistuhKurtz> you want to have private & public methods?
[10:25:32] <devone> basically i want prototype in jq but it seems like that's not gonna happen
[10:26:04] <devone> private and public is easy to do regardless how i implemenet though
[10:26:07] <devone> that's np MistuhKurtz
[10:30:52] <someprimetime> devone: you could always use the module pattern?
[10:32:13] <devone> example?
[10:33:34] <raj> if I JSON.stringify an object, is it supposed to show up on the serverside as an array?
[10:33:39] <raj> cuz that's what it's doing
[10:36:08] <Cork> raj: no, it might be that what you're working with is an array, or the server script parses it a bit weird
[10:36:21] <Cork> raj: check what JSON.stringify generates
[10:37:56] <Cork> raj: also, if your server code is php, everything is arrays there :)
[10:40:32] <someprimetime> devone: woops

[10:47:55] <fonko> guys, is there any fast function to validate that two fields (password) are equal?
[10:48:17] <Cork> vedder_: just find the corespondent tr and .remove() it
[10:48:46] <vedder_> um ok
[10:48:58] <Cork> fonko:  if($(field1).val() === $(field2).val()) {}
[10:49:48] <fonko> lol
[10:50:03] <fonko> sometimes you just dont use your brain i guess
[10:50:06] <fonko> thanks Cork
[10:50:09] <Cork> :)
[10:50:10] <someprimetime> fast function? $('#pass1').val() === $('#pass2').val() ? true : false
[10:50:16] <someprimetime> not a function though
[10:50:17] <fonko> i have been like 20 hours in front of the pc
[10:50:18] <someprimetime> but it can be
[10:50:24] <Cork> someprimetime: no need for the ? true : false
[10:50:32] <someprimetime> word
[10:57:18] <vedder_> is it better to assign values to labels using .html or .val
[10:57:19] <vedder_> ?
[10:57:46] <Cork> you can't modify labels through .val
[10:58:10] <Cork> thats for input, select and textarea elements
[10:58:15] <vedder_> i see
[11:06:16] <mib_mib_> hi guys, i want to test my javascript on an external domain, so i set up a proxy server that intercepts the request and puts in my javascript into the response - however, the $(document).ready() event doesn't seem to be firing, would anyone know why?
[11:07:38] <maasha> Hey, I'm fiddling with this javascript. I dont get why the hover() here don't fire first time, but only subsequently: http://jsfiddle.net/rbPRa/
[11:07:56] <gamingdroid> I need to serialize a bunch of field, convert it into json, stick the data into a hidden field and POST the form. Since this is not a public facing site with almost nil sensitive data, do I need to character encode (similar to URL encoding) the input field data?
[11:11:26] <fonko> is it possible to declare a global variable in javascript? i mean to use outside all functions? but i need to declare this inside a function
[11:12:16] <xec> omit the "var"
[11:13:03] <xec> it is a sign of bad design though, why do you want this?
[11:15:06] <JessC> variable scoping is slightly different in js vs other languages. declaring "var" before a variable name will keep that variable within that scope (ie function). not declaring a "var" will cause javascript to run up the scope until it finds the variable already declared or hits the global scope (window in the browser context).
[11:15:34] <rns> anyone know how to write a submit function in jquery that will take the formatted input value and convert it back using the autoNumericGet() function? http://www.decorplanit.com/plugin/
[11:15:36] <JessC> but xec is correct you probably shouldn't declare variables at the global scope as it leaves it open for other scripts to change those variables
[11:16:33] <chronos> Hello. I have following code: $("input").bind('autocompleteresponse', function(event, ui) {console.log(this, ui);}); ... when I search something I saw request being made, but this 'autocompleteresponse' event has any response. I tryed with  'autocompletesearch' and works
[11:17:06] <recurse> is there a way to include a javascript by src only once?
[11:18:03] <chronos> so, why autocompleteresponse not works?
[11:18:10] <chronos> when it is trigered
[11:19:32] * maasha reads about on()
[11:26:36] <maasha> nope. I dont get why .hover fails at first, but then works. How to debug this?
[11:31:18] <JessC> @recurse what do you mean include it only once?
[11:31:35] <JessC> what is it you are trying to do
[11:31:41] <recurse> Well, i have an include which includes a script multiple times
[11:31:46] <drvanon> Hello, I have a form generator which is generated by a JSON message (so it is not possible to have it at $(document).ready()) how would I use a ajaxForm for it?
[11:32:02] <recurse> i want to "filter" out the multiple occureces without a big rewrite
[11:32:32] <JessC> i guess it would depend on how its written, do you have an example?
[11:33:43] <spobat> hey
[11:33:47] <spobat> should this work? :)
[11:33:49] <spobat> $("#you-are-already-here").hover(function() {
[11:33:49] <spobat> 	alert('lol');	
[11:33:49] <spobat> });
[11:34:14] <spobat> it's an <a> with the id "you-are-already-here"
[11:37:57] <pifantastic> spobat: yes
[11:37:57] <Jon47> spobat i think the .hover method takes two parameters?
[11:38:29] <Jon47> oh i guess if you pass one function it just assumes that one function for both "in" and "out" events
[11:38:35] <Jon47> in that case, ya, that should work
[11:38:41] <pifantastic> spobat: http://jsfiddle.net/WKfVm/
[11:39:53] <spobat> okay, thanks
[11:41:19] <pifantastic> spobat: in the future

[11:53:53] <rns> anyone know how to write a submit function in jquery that will take the formatted input value and convert it back using the autoNumericGet() function? http://www.decorplanit.com/plugin/
[11:57:10] <MistuhKurtz> rns, why don't you take a stab at it on a jsfiddle and I'll try and get it working for you
[11:57:55] <anli_> When I have a dialog open and in that dialog have an autocomplete dropdown open, I want an esc press to only close the autocomplete dropdown, is that possible to do?
[11:58:37] <MistuhKurtz> anli_: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-closeOnEscape
[11:59:09] <anli_> Meaning that I need to reinit the dialogs every time I open an autocomplete?
[11:59:34] <MistuhKurtz> oh i have a better way
[11:59:53] <MistuhKurtz> bind a keydown event on your autocomplete input for esc, and call event.stopPropagation();
[12:00:08] <anli_> hm, then I unbind it when it is closing
[12:00:16] <anli_> Or will it unbind automatically?
[12:00:20] <anli_> That would be ultimate
[12:00:29] <MistuhKurtz> so it will only fire when the dropdown has focus, and it won't bubble up to the dialog
[12:01:22] <anli_> I will try it
[12:01:57] <anli_> Maybe I should have an .autocomplete2 function then
[12:02:03] <anli_> Hm, sucks a bit
[12:02:10] <MistuhKurtz> uh I don't think you would really need to unbind it...depends..
[12:02:27] <MistuhKurtz> eh better to abstract something to handle both scenarios instead of forking it
[12:02:33] <anli_> If it is destroed or not, I suppose
[12:02:39] <anli_> yeah
[12:02:49] <MistuhKurtz> if it's destroyed then the garbage collector will take care of it
[12:02:55] <anli_> yeah
[12:03:07] <rns> MistuhKurtz, here is what I have.  I'm not sure how to add an external Jquery library though...is this possible? http://jsfiddle.net/bgqyy/
[12:03:14] <anli_> Maybe I could hack the code to autocomplete a bit
[12:03:23] <anli_> And put a stopPropagation in there
[12:03:38] <anli_> Maybe it already has an option
[12:03:42] <anli_> checking
[12:04:27] <MistuhKurtz> anli_ if you want to try isolating it and making a fiddle i can take a look
[12:04:52] <MistuhKurtz> rns, fiddle automatically adds jquery for you, you just have to select it under "choose framework"
[12:05:16] <MistuhKurtz> and youd on't need the doc ready functions in there, it automatically wraps the code in one
[12:05:31] <rns> MistuhKurtz, I did that, but I am trying to get this working with an external library: http://www.decorplanit.com/plugin/
[12:06:20] <guide_X> how do I hit the node data from my template page
[12:06:33] <guide_X> like say i'm on a node, and the content type is gallery_items
[12:06:51] <guide_X> I have devel open..
[12:07:03] <guide_X> there's an (object) stdclass
[12:07:11] <guide_X> I want to get this..
[12:07:26] <SVCGHOST_> how come more ppl don't use vectors in their web design?
[12:07:30] <anli_> MistuhKurtz: first attempt of modifying minified code failed
[12:07:51] <MistuhKurtz> yeah try to avoid doing that.
[12:07:57] <guide_X> SVCGHOST_: I do when i'm using silverlight :D
[12:07:59] <yedi> will these two lines do the same thing?: $(".div .nested").each(<do stuff>) -- $(".div").find(".nested").each(<do stuff>)
[12:08:00] <guide_X> or xna
[12:08:29] <SVCGHOST_> guide_X: What vector framework
[12:09:47] <guide_X> in .net it's builting
[12:09:49] <guide_X> builtin
[12:09:50] <anli_> MistuhKurtz: 2nd attempt succeeded, however, I could not double press esc to hope for the dialog to close
[12:09:54] <guide_X> for silverlight and xna
[12:10:16] <guide_X> system.windows.vectors
[12:10:31] <anli_> I think autocomplete will eat the event the 2nd press as well
[12:12:09] <mbroyles> anyone have any exp. with superfish?
[12:12:33] <guide_X> yeah
[12:12:43] <anli_> MistuhKurtz: solved
[12:13:03] <MistuhKurtz> how so?
[12:13:12] <anli_> Change made in the minified code of autocomplete, case d.ESCAPE: var is_open = $('.ui-autocomplete.ui-widget:visible').length >0; a.element.val(a.term); if (is_open) { a.close(c); c.stopPropagation(); } break;
[12:13:33] <anli_> ah, could put the a.element inside the block
[12:13:44] <mbroyles> I'm not sure if you guys mind me asking this here, but I'm having a problem where superfish is making the menu disappear when the the links inside of the menu are "active" via being tab-selected
[12:15:56] <awc737> how can I get a status if an ajax url is incorrect?
[12:16:16] <anli_> How can it not be?
[12:16:33] <NoiseEee> awc737: define "incorrect"
[12:16:37] <awc737> I'm doing url:'wrong'}).done(function( data, statu ) { alert (status)
[12:16:50] <awc737> but status only alerts success if the URL is correct
[12:16:54] <awc737> and nothing if the URL is wrong
[12:17:19] <awc737> i'm also doing if (data.length > 0) { response.resolve, otherwise response.reject
[12:17:34] <awc737> but if the URL is incorrect, it does not fall under that else category, which seems odd
[12:17:37] <NoiseEee> .fail(function() { alert("error"); })
[12:17:56] <anli_> I still dont see how the url can be incorrect
[12:18:02] <anli_> Do you not decide which url you use?
[12:18:18] <awc737> yes but I just want a fail message
[12:18:28] <anli_> alert("fail"); // ;)
[12:18:36] <awc737> but thats odd I have to put a .fail here, cause I already have a .fail in my callback...
[12:18:46] <anli_> You can use $.ajax, I think it has a handler called failure
[12:18:51] <anli_> Or maybe its fail
[12:19:01] <anli_> ah, ok
[12:19:56] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/aQL
[12:20:07] <awc737> you see, I would think the callback's fail function would be enough
[12:20:44] <drpaulruth> Hi, if I have a whole bunch of jQuery hover bindings on a page, how can i restrict it so that only one can be open at a time?
[12:20:58] <NoiseEee> awc737: the .fail has to be part of the xhr call; ie: the getDefaultOrders() function
[12:21:39] <awc737> ok, thanks NoiseEee ... is that fail in the callback pointless then?
[12:21:48] <awc737> or necessary for performing action after the request is done
[12:22:03] <awc737> I am still new to understanding callbacks / deferred
[12:22:26] <MistuhKurtz> rns, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/bgqyy/2/
[12:23:02] <awc737> the .fail in the callback seems pointless, I could just throw everything from that into my jquery call
[12:23:11] <NoiseEee> awc737: yes lines 1-5 are unnecessary afaik
[12:23:28] <NoiseEee> your callback is line 18
[12:23:30] <MistuhKurtz> when you click 'save' you see the number formatting get stripped but it's only noticeable because i've disabled the default submit
[12:23:55] <anli_> Why do you want to reserve yourself for the event of rongggg.html to not exist?
[12:24:12] <MistuhKurtz> rns, you can add external libraries/plugins on jsfiddle by clicking the "Manage Resources" link in the left hand sidebar of jsfiddle
[12:26:13] <rns> MistuhKurtz, is there any easy site that will let me upload the autoNumeric library and then get back a url to use in jsfiddle?
[12:26:18] <MistuhKurtz> rns, you also have the option to sanitize the data on the back-end, which is probably more sensible
[12:26:35] <MistuhKurtz> rns, I already set it all up. It's loading autonumeric from a github library
[12:26:46] <MistuhKurtz> did you see the link i posted? I already solved it for you
[12:27:37] <rns> MistuhKurtz, oh nice, thanks!
[12:27:58] <MistuhKurtz> I added the 'auto' class so that you can just add that to any input you want and it will loop over all of them and strip the extra characters out
[12:28:00] <rns> I will give that a try
[12:29:09] <MistuhKurtz> rns, personally I like to use Dropbox when I need to quickly share an asset online (using Dropbox's public folder)
[12:30:09] <rns> MistuhKurtz, what does this line do? $('.auto').autoNumeric({mDec: '0'}).trigger('blur');
[12:30:46] <awc737> NoiseEee: why is line 1 unnecessary?
[12:30:46] <MistuhKurtz> i added the 'auto' class to your square feet field so that you can use it on more inputs
[12:30:53] <awc737> if it's the callback
[12:30:58] <MistuhKurtz> autoNumeric() initializes the plugin
[12:31:13] <awc737> and I don't want the code to execute until the request is finished
[12:31:38] <MistuhKurtz> trigger('blur') triggers the blur event so you will see it when the page loads with the default value, because otherwise it only gets formatted on blur or change (when you focus on the input and then change focus, or when you change the value)
[12:32:13] <rns> oh nice
[12:32:28] <MistuhKurtz> it's not necessary if you don't have a default value
[12:32:36] <MistuhKurtz> triggering blur, i mean
[12:32:43] <rns> so I can just prepend auto to all of my other field classees, and then that function will loop over all those fields?
[12:32:53] <NoiseEee> awc737: thats what the .done in the XHR call/function itself does
[12:32:54] <MistuhKurtz> yep
[12:35:15] <awc737> hmmm... i could sware I needed a callback
[12:36:11] <MistuhKurtz> any other questions rns? I'm gonna head to lunch
[12:36:31] <rns> MistuhKurtz, do you need the space between auto and the class name?
[12:36:43] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[12:36:52] <MistuhKurtz> an element can have multiple classes
[12:37:06] <rns> MistuhKurtz, oh so that's just giving it two different classes?
[12:37:08] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[12:37:34] <rns> MistuhKurtz, so if I have existing code that uses the existing name (without the "auto" prepended) then it should still work after adding the auto?
[12:37:49] <MistuhKurtz> yep
[12:37:53] <rns> awesome
[12:38:02] <rns> MistuhKurtz, thank you so much.  You have been super helpful
[12:38:07] <MistuhKurtz> np
[12:38:12] <rns> MistuhKurtz, I'll ping you and let you know how it works
[12:38:21] <rns> thanks for all the help = )
[12:38:27] <MistuhKurtz> I'll be around this afternoon if you have any questions
[12:38:28] <MistuhKurtz> take care
[12:39:57] <biberao> hi
[13:02:24] <tds5016> hi. I'm having an issue where I set a div's .click action.
[13:02:27] <danzik171> is jQuery.nodeName() a private/undocumented function?  could've sworn i saw it listed in the docs at some point
[13:02:46] <tds5016> but it looks like when I set .click() more than once, the .click() doesn't get overwritten; it looks like it gets added to.
[13:02:55] <tds5016> is that correct funtionality?
[13:03:30] <anli_> There can be any number of click handlers, yes
[13:03:43] <tds5016> so if I do $('#button').click(function(){console.log(1);}); $('#button').click(function(){console.log(2);});
[13:03:46] <biberao> hi
[13:03:49] <tds5016> it';lll print 1 2
[13:03:51] <biberao> wasnt there a lathan dude here?
[13:03:52] <tds5016> is that right?
[13:04:02] <anli_> Or the other order
[13:04:08] <tds5016> anli+ how do I clear the click order?
[13:04:08] <anli_> But sure
[13:04:13] <tds5016> er not the order. sorry...
[13:04:24] <anli_> I am not sure about order, I have heard it cannot be relied upon
[13:04:26] <tds5016> is there a way to clear all of the other handlers?
[13:04:30] <anli_> ah
[13:04:35] <anli_> unbind, I think
[13:04:38] <tds5016> er click orders?
[13:04:41] <tds5016> gotchya.
[13:05:07] <anli_> I think unbind can be used even if you did not use bind to install the click handler
[13:05:08] <NoiseEee> tds5016: using "on" to assign will let you use "off" to remove.
[13:05:13] <tds5016> actually, the fact it will let me do this is kind of useful.
[13:05:16] <anli_> aha
[13:05:23] <anli_> Thats why ppl uses on, I wondered a lot
[13:05:31] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/on/ @ tds5016\
[13:05:39] <tds5016> NoiseEee: so if I wanted to completely remove a handler I would use on vs off?
[13:05:42] <anli_> There is little use removing a handler on the other hand
[13:05:51] <anli_> Often the problem can be solved without removing it
[13:05:53] <NoiseEee> tds5016: only if you set it via .on
[13:05:55] <tds5016> sorry, vs. unbind*
[13:06:01] <NoiseEee> anli_: not necessarily true at all
[13:06:07] <anli_> I said often
[13:06:17] <systemfault> Forget bind/unbind.. they're useless/deprecated now
[13:06:22] <tds5016> if I use unbind, will that remove the handler?
[13:06:32] <NoiseEee> tds5016: it depends, read http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[13:06:38] <NoiseEee> tds5016: but you should be using .on and .off
[13:06:41] <NoiseEee> .click() is teh lame
[13:06:48] <anli_> Do you need to remove the handler?
[13:07:10] <tds5016> anli_: I need to remove all previous .click()s and replace it.
[13:07:26] <anli_> You can always store a function reference in a variable
[13:07:35] <anli_> put your new handler in that variable
[13:07:39] <tds5016> NoiseEee: why is useing .click the wrong thing to do? (I'm just trying to understand)
[13:07:45] <anli_> var foo = thehandler; function thehandler() {}
[13:08:07] <tds5016> anli, I'm using an anonymous function.
[13:08:13] <anli_> doesnt matter
[13:08:16] <NoiseEee> tds5016: using .on and then being able to remove via .off is far more flexible
[13:08:28] <anli_> you can assign it to foo anyway
[13:08:43] <NoiseEee> tds5016: As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() and .off() methods are preferred to attach and remove event handlers on elements.
[13:08:45] <tds5016> NoiseEee: doesn't bind and unbind do the same?
[13:08:51] <NoiseEee> tds5016: no, they are different.
[13:08:56] <kmurph> how would i manually change the user's location on the page (vertically)?
[13:08:57] <awc737> is getElements a jQuery function?
[13:08:59] <awc737> var elements = form.getElements('fieldset').concat(Array.from(form.elements));
[13:09:13] <NoiseEee> awc737: no
[13:09:14] <tds5016> NoiseEee: thanks! I didnt' realize that. I will go ahead and start using that :-)
[13:09:23] <rabbite> trying to check if #step_3_server_errors exists in the DOM
[13:09:26] <systemfault> tds5016: .on/off have the functionality of bind/unbind/delegate/live
[13:09:32] <awc737> I am so confused what that function is doing
[13:09:43] <awc737> is the everything right of .concat jQuery?
[13:09:48] <NoiseEee> awc737: looks like a bastardization of getElementsByTagName
[13:09:51] <tds5016> so for click I would do $('#button').on('click', function(){console.log(1);});
[13:09:59] <NoiseEee> tds5016: indeed.
[13:10:06] <rabbite> if ( '#step_3_server_errors' ).!exists {} ?
[13:10:10] <NoiseEee> tds5016: its also easy to use event delegation with .on as well
[13:10:12] <tds5016> and then if I use off it removes it complete?
[13:10:30] <NoiseEee> tds5016: yeah, you can just do $('#button').off() to remove everything assigned via .on()
[13:10:34] <anli_> awc737: Also, using form tags is not always necessary, in the ages of ajax
[13:10:40] <tds5016> oh, cool!
[13:11:06] <tds5016> so if I do .on() with no arguments, would that readd them?
[13:11:08] <awc737> what tag did I use?
[13:11:19] <NoiseEee> tds5016: nope :(
[13:11:19] <awc737> I'm trying to use the similar function with my own forms...
[13:11:21] <awc737> var elements = jQuery("form :input"); elements = elements.concat(Array.from(form.elements));
[13:11:29] <anli_> I was referring to <form>, maybe I am mistaken about you using it
[13:11:38] <awc737> oh yeah i thought it was necessary
[13:11:40] <rabbite> ha! if (!this.length) should work
[13:11:48] <anli_> awc737: does not match <select>
[13:12:06] <tds5016> NoiseEee: good, that's actually what I want :-D
[13:12:11] <anli_> awc737: Well, you can use it if your like new to this
[13:12:33] <anli_> Wait, is :input actually matching select?
[13:12:38] <anli_> I never heard about :input
[13:13:16] <anli_> Why do people insist of using jQuery instead of $ ?
[13:13:38] <systemfault> What people?
[13:13:44] <anli_> Some
[13:13:49] <awc737> anli_: because i'm in no conflict mode
[13:14:08] <awc737> because it's an extension for a CMS, I don't know what other people might have
[13:14:10] <anli_> How can there be a conflict if jquery is the only lib using the $ global :)
[13:14:19] <awc737> you assume that
[13:14:24] <anli_> yeah, I do
[13:14:24] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/aRi
[13:14:54] <awc737> see I don't know wtf is up with the CMS's forms that they can use that elements=form.getElements crap
[13:15:08] <tds5016> thanks guys, you rock1
[13:15:16] <awc737> but I just need to format my form's elements in a similar way to be used by that for loop
[13:15:27] <anli_> Is there a .trim()? I always use $.trim()
[13:15:38] <anli_> instead of elemen.trim()
[13:15:40] <anli_> +t
[13:16:29] <awc737> I don't know, but while I could send my form through that loop, it and element[i].name was the correct name, it still wasn't returning the error on the actual object
[13:16:59] <awc737> see where I element.addClass: http://paste.laravel.com/aRj
[13:17:49] <anli_> Seems like you throw away the span you are creating
[13:17:52] <anli_> I may be wrong however
[13:18:02] <anli_> I was
[13:18:08] <anli_> The contrast ;)
[13:18:27] <awc737> I don't know the difference between that getElement line they use... where the element is actually having the object appended to it in the end
[13:18:46] <awc737> like they are casting the form elements to actual objects, not just referencing them by name or id
[13:19:08] <anli_> var elements = $(':input'); maybe
[13:19:14] <anli_> Wild guess
[13:19:24] <anli_> You dont have multiple forms, do you?
[13:19:42] <awc737> no would it make a difference? I'm passing the form in as an argument
[13:20:11] <anli_> Well, you dont have to do that then
[13:20:54] <awc737> ok, it didn't change the problem
[13:21:55] <anli_> I must check if :input is valid
[13:22:14] <anli_> Else its var elements = $('input,select,textarea'); or something
[13:22:15] <awc737> actually, I deleted that wierd line of code with getElement
[13:22:23] <anli_> cool
[13:22:31] <awc737> and the original form I thought needed it works with just :input
[13:22:35] <awc737> except my form does not
[13:22:49] <awc737> it does alert (element) and (element.name)
[13:22:55] <awc737> but it is not addingClass
[13:24:02] <awc737> oh wow
[13:24:06] <awc737> jQuery(element).addClass
[13:24:16] <anli_> Ah, I succceeded using :input, cool
[13:24:21] <anli_> yeah
[13:24:37] <awc737> I wonder how the heck the original form was having the class appended without jQuery(element)
[13:24:40] <awc737> it was just element.addClass
[13:24:52] <awc737> but either way, it works for both forms now with jQuery(element)
[13:25:06] <anli_> you can always use element.classname = "foo bar";
[13:25:17] <anli_> If the element is just a dom node (not jquery obj)
[13:25:56] <awc737> well then I guess that was the difference?
[13:26:15] <awc737> their form was a dom node, and my form was not
[13:26:25] <anli_> ah
[13:26:34] <anli_> you can get the dom node by using .get(0)
[13:26:35] <awc737> lol how do I make it a dom node?
[13:26:38] <anli_> heh
[13:26:41] <anli_> but you dont need those
[13:26:54] <awc737> yeah I'm happy with jQuery(element), it works for both
[13:27:06] <anli_> jquery is the way I would prefer in any case
[13:29:51] <koesbong> hey all, i have a .attr() vs .prop() question. on an element like <a href="#foo">, when i use .attr('href'), i'd get "#foo", but when i use .prop('href'), i'd get "http://bar.com#foo". why is that?
[13:29:53] <awc737> yeah
[13:29:55] <awc737> thanks anli_
[13:29:58] <anli_> np
[13:30:16] <anli_> Isnt .attr the preferred way? I think so
[13:30:22] <koesbong> is there a rule of thumb on when to use .attr() and when to use .prop()?
[13:30:34] <anli_> hm, interesting difference
[13:30:42] <anli_> prop is trying to think for you
[13:30:49] <koesbong> if you did .attr('id') and .prop('id'), you'd get the same result
[13:30:57] <anli_> Strange thing there is no .id()
[13:31:05] <anli_> Although I dont like ids
[13:31:35] <anli_> Still, its odd, I added that function in my server side jquery implementation (in php)
[13:31:44] <anli_> To scrape webpages
[13:45:27] <aettinger> howdy
[13:45:44] <aettinger> is there anyway to determine ancestor's z-index for an element?
[13:46:32] <anli_> Maybe you can walk the parent chain and use .css('z-index') until you find something
[13:46:36] <anli_> .parent()
[13:47:35] <anli_> Hm, maybe z-index is inherited btw, must check
[13:47:36] <aettinger> anli_: that's what i'm thinking
[13:48:37] <koesbong> i kinda figured out .prop vs .attr on href now
[13:48:51] <koesbong> .prop does link.href call, while .attr does link.getAttribute('href')
[13:51:36] <anli_> ok
[14:04:51] <nFFF> Guys anyway to reload a page with some javascript disabled via chrome dev tools?
[14:05:52] <systemfault> Yeah... just check the disable javascript checkbox in the dev tools...
[14:06:00] <systemfault> Ah.. "some"
[14:06:05] <systemfault> nevermind :)
[14:06:42] <Jon47> not sure i understand the question nFFF...
[14:07:16] <nFFF> systemfault, Im not sure I follow you?
[14:10:20] <Jon47> nFFF: you can redirect via manipulation of the location object or *maybe* by appending a meta redirect tag, e.g.:
[14:10:20] <Jon47> <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url={new url}">
[14:10:20] <Jon47> but i have no idea if that works after page load, or if it needs to be appended to the <head> or what… but really, giving the user a link that they want to click is the best way ;)
[14:10:35] <Jon47> gotta jet, good luck
[14:11:31] <nFFF> Im on a page that is running some javascript on click of a button, I dont want it to run when I click the button
[14:11:32] <nFFF> How do?
[14:11:51] <nFFF> Ive located the code in chrome dev tools
[14:11:53] <nFFF> how to disable
[14:13:02] <JessC> why don't you run script to unbind that action in the console?
[14:13:11] <JessC> $(element).unbind("click");
[14:13:50] <nFFF> How would I run a script ?
[14:14:23] <nFFF> Oh wait nvmd
[14:14:25] <nFFF> i understand
[14:19:21] <rns> MistuhKurtz, will your code work if I have multiple forms?  For some reason it's not working, but I'm thinking that it might be because I'm using a formset.  Would that cause any problems?
[14:19:31] <MistuhKurtz> what's a formset?
[14:19:39] <rns> wow that was fast = )
[14:19:49] <MistuhKurtz> lol i randomly pulled up this channel right before you sent that
[14:19:50] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[14:20:10] <MistuhKurtz> I wrote it so that on submission, it will loop through all the inputs that are only a part of that form that's being submitted
[14:20:18] <MistuhKurtz> $('input.auto', this)
[14:20:29] <MistuhKurtz> this is a context selector meaning that 'input.auto' must be a descendant element
[14:20:42] <rns> I am using a formset in django, which allows users to dynamically add new forms to the "formset", and when submitted all forms are submitted and parsed server side
[14:21:17] <rns> so if I want this to work on all forms, would I have to do something different?
[14:21:24] <MistuhKurtz> uh
[14:21:27] <MistuhKurtz> what does the markup look like
[14:21:46] <rns> what do you mean?  The actual output of all the forms?
[14:21:51] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[14:22:00] <rns> hold on I'll paste it all in
[14:22:04] <rns> to jsfiddle
[14:22:23] <MistuhKurtz> are there multiple <form> tags?
[14:22:47] <MistuhKurtz> clean it up and simplify it if you could
[14:24:23] <rns> MistuhKurtz, http://jsfiddle.net/8Sh79/
[14:25:51] <MistuhKurtz> there's no <form> tag rns
[14:25:53] <MistuhKurtz> that's why it's failing
[14:28:56] <rns> MistuhKurtz, there it is with the form tag and also with your code and the autonumeric library http://jsfiddle.net/8Sh79/2/
[14:29:33] <MistuhKurtz> rns, might want to read up on js debugging
[14:29:43] <MistuhKurtz> are you a programmer familiar with other languages but new to JS?
[14:30:16] <rns> yes
[14:30:56] <MistuhKurtz> yeah if you pulled up your console you could immediately tell it wasn't working because you're calling tabs() and that function is undefined
[14:31:19] <MistuhKurtz> and that halts JS execution
[14:31:53] <tff> Does anyone know of a plugin or collection of plugins that takes a form, populates it with a serialization, and changes its fields to appropriately sized and styled divs?
[14:32:30] <tff> I'm already about to use the populate plugin, and just disable the elements so that the client can view a form submission (in an administration interface), but changing them to divs would be cleaner.
[14:32:36] <tff> But I don't really know javascript or jquery, so
[14:33:53] <MistuhKurtz> tff, sounds like a better job for the back-end
[14:34:22] <tff> What do you mean?
[14:34:24] <tff> Oh
[14:34:26] <tff> right
[14:34:38] <tff> Yeah, I'll probably end up doing that i guess
[14:34:52] <tff> Javascript/jquery just always seem to have magical solutions up their sleeves
[14:36:09] <tds5016> is it possible to temporarily disable the .on('click') event?
[14:36:52] <tds5016> so basically I want to "disable" a button, and then reenable it without having to reset the click event...
[14:37:16] <MistuhKurtz> is it a <button> element tds5016 ?
[14:37:29] <tds5016> nope. unfortunately it's a div.
[14:37:35] <tds5016> yes, I know... bad....
[14:37:40] <tds5016> but that's what it is :-(
[14:37:52] <MistuhKurtz> what do you need to disable the click for?
[14:38:00] <MistuhKurtz> so that they can click something else that's a child of the div?
[14:38:11] <tds5016> because when I'm in a given state the user should not be allowed to click on those buttons.
[14:38:16] <tds5016> until I leave a given state.
[14:38:38] <tds5016> so I open a box, and I want to disable those buttons from being clicked.
[14:41:18] <JessC> how are you tracking the state?
[14:41:37] <JessC> inside the click function you can just return if it doesn't match a certain "clickable" state
[14:41:42] <JessC> to prevent any actions happening
[14:41:57] <MistuhKurtz> tds5016,  you could add data-disabled="true" and in your click handler, test for that value
[14:42:18] <wroathe> http://perfectionkills.com/whats-wrong-with-extending-the-dom/
[14:42:39] <wroathe> This article recommends object wrappers as an alternative to dom extensions
[14:42:42] <wroathe> I don't quite know what that means
[14:42:53] <wroathe> Like specifically what that looks like
[14:43:23] <wroathe> I'm writing a jQuery plugin and considering extending the dom node the plugin is initialized with with the plugin's public interface
[14:43:38] <wroathe> So you could be like node.myPluginName.collapse();
[14:44:25] <wroathe> So what's a better pattern than that?
[14:44:54] <systemfault> :/
[14:45:07] <systemfault> See how jQuery does it...
[14:45:10] <wroathe> Right now jQuery's data() method does something similar
[14:45:20] <systemfault> jQuery wraps nodes
[14:46:12] <wroathe> It generates a jQueryXXXXXXXXXX key and uses that to set a property on the node like node.jQueryXXXXXXXXX and that properties value is equal to the id that node uses to access jQueries internal cache
[14:46:47] <systemfault> wroathe: jQuery uses attributes AFAIK
[14:47:00] <wroathe> What do you mean attributes?
[14:47:05] <wroathe> Like data-* attributes?
[14:49:05] <wroathe> I read through the code and it only really uses those data-* attributes as a fallback if there's no data in the internal cache that matches that data-* name
[14:49:06] <systemfault> Hmm.. nevermind.. seems that it has a global map that do node to object(data)
[14:51:38] <wroathe> The difference between what they do with data and what I'd be doing with my plugin's interface is that they add a unique cache ID to that element and then use that element's cache ID to access the internal cache. So the data type of the extension property is an integer, whereas my extension would be an object with methods attached to it.
[14:52:59] <wroathe> Another pattern I see with that is $(...).myPluginName.publicMethod();
[14:53:12] <wroathe> I suppose that wouldn't hurt either
[14:53:34] <systemfault> wroathe: YUI3 uses another pattern if you want to see something different.
[14:54:15] <wroathe> Sure
[14:55:51] <YammYcoding> <div class='options'> <h3>title1</h3> <div>foo1</div>  <h3>title2</h3> <div>foo2</div> </div>      I want to show only the titles, and when click one, the others get hidden. Can i have a toggle for visibility instead of slide ?
[14:56:14] <zfly9> Hey guys I have a handful of jquery items on my site, http://goo.gl/YOtWM, and for some reason the slider and the jquery that styles the <select> menu in the footer contact form don;t work randomly on refresh
[14:56:23] <mib_mib> hi guys, for some reason $(document).ready() is not firing for me - i'd like to figure out why - I definitely have jquery loaded beforehand - javascript outside of $(document).ready is getting loaded - how do I look for when document.ready should be firing? i.e. the load event?
[14:57:03] <systemfault> mib_mib: .ready is called before the .load event
[14:57:47] <mib_mib> systemfault: ah right - so how can i trace why $(document).ready isn't being called?
[14:57:58] <wroathe> zfly9: Usually that means something hasn't correctly loaded. I'd check and make sure the elements you're trying to manipulate exist while the script is running.
[14:58:14] <wroathe> mib_mib: Paste your code.
[14:58:19] <MistuhKurtz> are there any errors in your console
[14:58:23] <MistuhKurtz> is $ defined
[14:58:27] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/
[14:59:41] <mib_mib> so its working fine for me, if i paste it into the developer console of a page
[14:59:47] <mib_mib> here is the code
[15:01:01] <wroathe> mib_mib: Code?
[15:02:06] <mib_mib> wroathe: https://gist.github.com/9e3613afe3d387687912
[15:02:46] <MistuhKurtz> yeah that's an IIFE not jquery $(document).ready(
[15:03:05] <mib_mib> and inside that javascript is
[15:03:19] <zfly9> wroathe, I'm not sure if I follow you
[15:03:31] <MistuhKurtz> mib_mib, so is that file loading fine?
[15:03:51] <mib_mib> MistuhKurtz: it appears to be loading correctly yes
[15:04:15] <MistuhKurtz> since you don't have a different domain for your HTTPS you don't need to do the protocol stuff
[15:04:16] <wroathe> zfly9: You said your code randomly doesn't initialize
[15:04:36] <MistuhKurtz> dm.src = "//static.domain.com/js/file.js";
[15:04:41] <wroathe> zfly9: That usually indicates that a part of the DOM you're trying to manipulate isn't available at the time the script loads.
[15:05:08] <MistuhKurtz> well this is going to asynchronously load the file
[15:05:29] <mib_mib> yes, so the file should be async loaded, and then the stuff inside document.ready should run, correct? although it doesnt seem to...
[15:05:29] <MistuhKurtz> but if you have a doc ready in the file you're loading it shouldn't (I think) be a problem
[15:05:37] <wroathe> That async shouldn't change anything
[15:05:46] <wroathe> Because if the document is already ready then jQuery just fires off the callback
[15:05:55] <mib_mib> yep
[15:05:56] <wroathe> So there's something else going on
[15:06:00] <mib_mib> yeah....
[15:06:05] <wroathe> Lets see the next part of the code.
[15:06:11] <scotdb> struggling with a selector : <tbody><tr><td><input id="x"/></td><td><input/ ></td></tr></tbody> : I have the ID of "x" as $(this) and I want to set the id of the other <td> to "x1" by reference to $(this)
[15:06:28] <wroathe> scotdb: Post code.
[15:06:38] <MistuhKurtz> ^ on jsfiddle
[15:06:42] <wroathe> Gross
[15:06:54] <fonko> hey guys i need to check two variables among each other and also make sure they are not empt string
[15:07:25] <mib_mib> wroathe: yeah i pasted it in the same gist, updated
[15:07:26] <fonko> is that possible inside the if statement?
[15:07:29] <wroathe> var one, two; if (one === '' || two === '') { foo(); }
[15:07:40] <fonko> awesome thanks sr
[15:07:44] <zfly9> wraothe I've tried various calls and nothing I Try fixes it
[15:08:38] <wroathe> zfly9: Post code
[15:09:08] <zfly9> wroathe I included the live link
[15:09:17] <wroathe> mib_mib: So when it loads which one of those three alerts fires?
[15:09:34] <HyShai> does the 'load' event still work for specific elements? or only (window).load?
[15:09:39] <mib_mib> wroathe: the 'ok' fires, then none of the other ones
[15:11:51] <MistuhKurtz> mib_mib, try jQuery(document).ready(function($){    });
[15:12:17] <mib_mib> MistuhKurtz: yeah i tried that, i don't think it works, but let me try it again
[15:12:29] <wroathe> Or, better yet, add $ to the list of arguments the closure accepts and pass in jQuery at the invocation
[15:13:11] <wroathe> mib_mib: The 'ok' fires?
[15:13:22] <wroathe> But not the 'hiya' or 'loaded'?
[15:13:30] <mib_mib> you mean like (jQuery) at the end?
[15:13:37] <mib_mib> wroathe: yes
[15:13:49] <wroathe> Yeah
[15:13:50] <mib_mib> wroathe: i mean, so when i copy paste this into the developer console, everything works beautifully
[15:14:06] <wroathe> mib_mib: Yeah. My guess is that that script isn't being loaded.
[15:14:06] <mib_mib> wroathe: however, when i try to inject it in using a proxy server, it doesn't work...
[15:14:16] <wroathe> Especially since neither of those two alerts are firing.
[15:14:39] <mib_mib> wroathe: the difference being what is loaded on the page im going to - other script collisions maybe?
[15:14:54] <mib_mib> wroathe: well, i can see it being loaded
[15:14:58] <mib_mib> wroathe: let me check
[15:15:00] <wroathe> mib_mib: I mean like (function ($) { foo(); }(jQuery));
[15:15:02] <mib_mib> brb
[15:15:14] <mib_mib> wroathe: okay
[15:15:32] <mib_mib> wroathe: do i surround everything in that?
[15:15:45] <mib_mib> o r just replace document.ready
[15:16:19] <wroathe> No, I mean use that instead of the initial closure.
[15:16:37] <HyShai> hyshai
[15:16:41] <HyShai> does the 'load' event still work for specific elements? or only (window).load?
[15:16:58] <mib_mib> so instead of document.ready(.... ) use (function ($) { foo(); }(jQuery));
[15:17:03] <wroathe> HyShai: It should work for a variety of different elements
[15:17:10] <wroathe> mib_mib: ...
[15:17:20] <systemfault> mib_mib: :/
[15:17:20] <wroathe> mib_mib: Do you write much javascript?
[15:17:22] <scotdb> http://jsfiddle.net/j5rcF/ : I am new here, so hopefully that is fine
[15:17:22] <HyShai> wroathe: thx
[15:17:26] <mib_mib> wroathe: i guess im confused by what you meant by 'the initial closure'
[15:18:00] <wroathe> Closure isn't really correct
[15:18:09] <wroathe> What I mean is self-invoking anonymous function
[15:18:14] <scotdb> I'm trying to update the transdatedb[] id for a newly added table row based on the transdate[] id
[15:18:24] <wroathe> The first and only self-invoking anonymous function you have in that example
[15:18:35] <mib_mib> wroathe: ok that makes more sense.... so document.ready((function ($) { foo(); }(jQuery));
[15:18:48] <wroathe> Nope
[15:18:57] <mib_mib> wroathe: lol
[15:19:50] <systemfault> Wow... mib_mib was a clown..
[15:19:58] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/6fb9b4d065a4f3cf41d5
[15:20:43] <wroathe> Actually
[15:20:47] <wroathe> I'm failing a bit
[15:20:49] <wroathe> That wouldn't help.
[15:21:36] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/6fb9b4d065a4f3cf41d5
[15:21:46] <wroathe> But that's most likely not your problem.
[15:22:02] <scotdb> wroathe : I have (hopefully) posted a jsfiddle ... let me know if I've "failed" as I am new on this forum
[15:22:26] <wroathe> scotdb: Where is it?
[15:22:32] <scotdb> http://jsfiddle.net/j5rcF/
[15:24:15] <wroathe> scotdb: None of those inputs have ids
[15:24:35] <wroathe> And ids can't start with numbers
[15:24:49] <wroathe> So $(this).attr('id') + 1 would probably fail
[15:25:13] <scotdb> OK, the IDs get generated by datePicker (format it dp<Some number>)
[15:25:46] <wroathe> So what you're trying to do is dp3 + 1 = dp4?
[15:26:06] <scotdb> No, it actually makes it dp3 + 1 = dp31
[15:26:07] <HyShai> HyShai
[15:26:14] <scotdb> that actually works
[15:26:29] <wroathe> So what's the problem?
[15:26:32] <scotdb> the bit I'm trying to get my head around is this line -
[15:26:59] <zfly9> wroathe live site no good?
[15:27:16] <scotdb> $(this).parent().children().eq(3).attr("id", "#" + db_id);
[15:27:16] <wroathe> zfly9: I don't see a problem. It loads fine for me.
[15:27:46] <zfly9> loads fine 4/5 times but you refresh a few times it will fail
[15:28:11] <wroathe> zfly9: The slider itself?
[15:28:13] <wroathe> Or something else?
[15:28:56] <wroathe> $(this).parent() will get the parent of that input element
[15:29:08] <wroathe> $(this).parent() in this case the table cell
[15:29:15] <scotdb> I want to set the ID on the newly created row for the transdatedb (class) element to the id of the transdate (class) element but with _db stuck on the end
[15:29:16] <wroathe> $(this).parent().children() will get all children of that table cell
[15:29:27] <YammYcoding> how can i change that code to show the right div and hide the others?   http://jsfiddle.net/qBgup/
[15:29:32] <wroathe> $(this).parent().children() so in this case that single input
[15:30:10] <wroathe> $(this).parent().children().eq(3) will get the 4th child element
[15:30:17] <wroathe> Which, in this case, will be undefined
[15:30:23] <HyShai> is there a simple way to wait for an image to load (to get height())?
[15:30:34] <HyShai> .load() doesnt work consistently
[15:30:43] <scotdb> I make $(this) as an <input> ?   So parent() should be <td> ... I need ANOTHER parent to go up the extra level before going down the other <td>
[15:30:45] <scotdb> ???
[15:30:54] <wroathe> HyShai: .load is for ajax
[15:31:21] <wroathe> scotdb: What's that eq() supposed to be grabbing?
[15:31:35] <rns> MistuhKurtz, would your code possibly not be working for me because I'm using ajax to submit the form?
[15:31:43] <wroathe> HyShai: You're looking for something like $(...).on('load', function () { foo(); });
[15:31:58] <HyShai> wroathe: there is an event .load() - just a shortcut for .bind() http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[15:31:58] <scotdb> I'm trying to grab the <input class="transdatedb"> on the same row as the <input class="transdate"
[15:32:31] <HyShai> wroathe: exactly let's see if it works thx
[15:32:40] <zfly9> wroathe yes the slider and another jquery element
[15:32:56] <wroathe> scotdb: So yeah, you need .parent().parent()
[15:33:32] <wroathe> And, actually, .last() would probably work just as well as that eq
[15:33:54] <wroathe> So $(this).parent().parent().children().last()
[15:33:56] <jrdn> does a JSONP request pass XMLHttpRequest headers?
[15:34:09] <scotdb> wroathe ... thanks ... so .last() will give me the <td> and then I need to get the <input> under it
[15:34:48] <systemfault> jrdn: No, JSONP is an ugly hack
[15:35:10] <systemfault> jrdn: it uses a <script> tag with src to load the content
[15:35:21] <wroathe> So $(this).parent().parent().children().last().children().first()
[15:35:24] <wroathe> Gross
[15:35:27] <jrdn> systemfault, that's what i thought
[15:35:57] <systemfault> wroathe: Ew
[15:35:58] <scotdb> wroathe ... Is that "gross" for my one ?
[15:36:03] <jrdn> is JSONP still the better way to do cross domain requests? Or should i start allowing hosts via nginx config / etc
[15:36:08] <wroathe> scotdb: I'd probably look for a cleaner solution than that.
[15:36:19] <JessC> COORS
[15:36:26] <systemfault> jrdn: The best way is CORS... JSONP is the most compatible.
[15:36:33] <JessC> is a better solution but you need control of all the servers
[15:36:34] <scotdb> wroathe ... it does seem a bit much ...
[15:36:43] <wroathe> scotdb: Like maybe .parent().parent().find('.translatedb')
[15:38:00] <wroathe> systemfault: Yeah, agreed.
[15:38:16] <systemfault> When you need more than a single .parent(), consider using .closest() instead
[15:38:42] <wroathe> systemfault: I forgot about closest
[15:38:45] <scotdb> wroathe ... will give that a go ...
[15:39:08] <wroathe> scotdb: Do something like $(this).closest('tr').find('.translatedb');
[15:39:36] <MistuhKurtz> rns, possibly
[15:39:47] <MistuhKurtz> if you have another submit handler tod o the ajax submission, then yes
[15:39:57] <MistuhKurtz> the code i wrote should be a part of that same submit handler
[15:40:11] <MistuhKurtz> prior to submission
[15:40:34] <zfly9> Hey guys I have a handful of jquery items on my site, http://goo.gl/YOtWM, and for some reason the slider and the jquery that styles the <select> menu in the footer contact form don;t work randomly on refresh
[15:40:43] <rns> MistuhKurtz, here is my other submit handler: http://jsfiddle.net/g7yJq/
[15:40:53] <wroathe> scotdb: Great success?
[15:41:59] <MistuhKurtz> yeah you need to do that loop before you define params
[15:45:53] <rns> MistuhKurtz, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/g7yJq/1/
[15:47:20] <jrdn> JessC, systemfault: what do you think about allowing all access and just preventing access via oauth or database driven whitelisting / blacklisting
[15:48:21] <MistuhKurtz> rns, http://jsfiddle.net/g7yJq/2/
[15:48:58] <scotdb> wroathe : still not quite there ... but getting there
[15:49:01] <MistuhKurtz> I would advise that instead of binding your handler to a 'click' on #save_tenant, you should bind it to the form's submit event
[15:49:15] <scotdb> The ID is now set correctly, but the altField setting still isn't working
[15:49:17] <JessC> @jrdn for CORS I'd recommend specifying IPs for any production environment
[15:49:19] <scotdb> looking at it now
[15:49:33] <scotdb> wroathe : thanks for your help so far
[15:50:44] <JessC> @jrdn or should i say subdomains
[15:50:50] <JessC> .somedomain.com
[15:51:08] <rns> MistuhKurtz, it's working!
[15:51:28] <MistuhKurtz> great!
[15:51:36] <scotdb> wroathe ... all working now ... brilliant !!!  Thank You !!!
[15:51:40] <rns> MistuhKurtz, why is the 'click' event the weaker option here?
[15:52:44] <MistuhKurtz> rns, I'm probably just being nit-picky and it feels more natural to me (just makes more sense to extend the native submit function, since that's what we're doing) but when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter
[15:53:36] <ajpiano> rns: you are trying to deal with the conceptual action of the form being submitted.  binding to click on a submit button when what you really want is the submit event is like someone telling you that they just left the house, when you asked them to let you know when they'd arrived at your place
[15:53:40] <rns> MistuhKurtz, okay that makes sense.  Thank you so much for all your help today.
[15:54:03] <MistuhKurtz> np
[15:54:10] <rns> ajpiano, good analogy
[15:54:10] <ajpiano> anyhow +1 to MistuhKurtz's nitpick :)
[15:54:52] <MistuhKurtz> good luck on your journey further learning js rns :D
[15:55:31] <rns> MistuhKurtz, thanks! As long as there are generous folks like you around, there is hope for me yet = )
[15:55:41] <MistuhKurtz> the other benefit to binding to the submit event is that it sets 'this' to the form, (<form>) rather than the button
[15:56:07] <MistuhKurtz> well there always are, that's just one thing I love about this job :D
[15:58:45] <jrdn> JessC, yeah that's do-able
[16:05:01] <MistuhKurtz> Anybody have experience optimizing/smoothing out transitions in a slideshow for images that have been resized to full browser width?
[16:05:56] <MistuhKurtz> the transitions aren't perfectly smooth because a very large image is being animated. I'm wondering if it can be animated any differently to make it smoother
[16:06:30] <ktom49> heya!
[16:07:05] <ktom49> anyone here?
[16:07:26] <bot-t> ktom49, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[16:08:27] <ktom49> in jQuery, how to I iterate over the first 10 elements of a JSON response when the API call returns 20?
[16:10:03] <ajpiano> ktom49: $.each( array.slice(0, 10), function(index, elem) { });
[16:10:58] <jrdn> dang, getting sexy ajpiano
[16:10:59] <ktom49> interesting ajpiano, it's close to what I've been trying
[16:12:02] <ktom49> sry, huge jQuery noob
[16:12:12] <ajpiano> yeah, as we say in the biz
[16:12:14] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs
[16:12:14] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[16:12:26] <ktom49> my line that works currently is:
[16:12:29] <ktom49> $.each(data.query.results.json.photos, function(i, photo){
[16:12:51] <ajpiano> is x.y.z.photos an array or an object
[16:13:04] <ktom49> I believe it's a JSON object
[16:13:07] <ktom49> (document?)
[16:13:25] <ajpiano> ?g no such thing as json object ben alman
[16:13:26] <bot-t> ajpiano, Ben Alman  There's no such thing as a "JSON Object" - http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
[16:13:47] <ktom49> the line above is $.getJSON(url, function(data) {
[16:13:56] <ajpiano> assuming it is not still a json string, it is either an array or an object
[16:13:57] <ktom49> sorry for the wrong terminology.
[16:13:59] <ajpiano> right
[16:14:07] <ajpiano> but i don't know what that data looks like
[16:14:23] <ajpiano> assuming it's an array, you should just be able to slice it and iterate over only the new sliced array
[16:16:05] <ktom49> so I should just change my $.each(…) line to $.each(slice(0,9)).  ?
[16:19:15] <ktom49> you f'n rock ajpiano!
[16:19:50] <ktom49> I was trying to chain the .slice(0,9) to the .each(), not to the array of returned items
[16:19:55] <ajpiano> ah
[16:19:57] <ktom49> thanks so much!
[16:19:59] <ajpiano> no prob
[16:20:06] <ktom49> again, jQuery noob to the max :)
[16:20:16] <ktom49> learn something new every day.
[16:20:20] <ajpiano> now a tiny bit less :)
[16:20:39] <ktom49> yep, rinse and repeat another 10,000 times and life will be good
[16:21:05] <ktom49> BTW, you wouldn't happen to be in the west coast, would you?
[16:21:54] <ajpiano> ktom49: nope, why
[16:23:06] <ktom49> just curious. always looking for more devs to kick it with in RL :)
[16:23:30] <jrdn> that's creepy
[16:24:38] <rns> MistuhKurtz, so is there a good way to get the inputs to automatically format when the form loads, rather than when the input loses focus?
[16:25:19] <MistuhKurtz> rns, that's a shortcoming of the plugin you're using
[16:25:57] <MistuhKurtz> I would say file a bug report on the github repo but that repo isn't maintained by the plugin author, and it's not the most recent version
[16:26:19] <MistuhKurtz> $('input.auto').trigger('blur'); does the trick, though.
[16:26:38] <MistuhKurtz> after you call the plugin first, of course
[16:27:17] <rns> MistuhKurtz, I'm using that .trigger('blur') and it doesn't seem to be working
[16:27:42] <MistuhKurtz> isolate and make a fiddle then
[16:28:00] <MistuhKurtz> but please do make an effort to really simplify and isolate the problem...
[16:32:09] <carpii> anyone available for a couple of hours jquery/html work? msg me for spec plz
[16:36:18] <nsanden_> i have really quick job if anyone wants it, 10 bucks paypal. i want any "data-*" attributes in an html tag to be pulled out and converted into an associative array
[16:38:28] <carpii> nsanden_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4187032/get-list-of-data-attributes-using-javascript-jquery
[16:39:27] <nsanden_> carpii: awesome thank you
[16:39:45] <carpii> np
[16:47:05] <rns> MistuhKurtz, after this form is submitted, the formatting happens only after the input loses focus: http://jsfiddle.net/bgqyy/2/
[16:48:59] <carpii> te comma formatting?
[16:50:06] <rns> carpii, yea
[16:50:30] <carpii> seems ok in chrome?
[16:50:51] <rns> carpii, after you submit the form it automatically formats the inputs again?
[16:51:03] <carpii> hm after submitting, it loses the commas
[16:51:09] <carpii> until i change input then it readds them
[16:51:33] <rns> oh wait
[16:51:40] <rns> hmm
[16:56:01] <Justin_T> i have a select box with multiple option enable, i would like to know if i can resize it while adding items from another select box with jquery?

[17:38:28] <aettinger> anyone do smart positioning before?
[17:44:15] <CiE> Hi everyone
[17:44:32] <CiE> Anyone available?
[17:44:43] <aettinger> for?
[17:45:04] <CiE> I was hoping someone might know about fullcalendar.js and it's json feed?
[17:47:47] <CiE> i guess no one knows. Does anyone know if there is a support forum or irc channel for fullcalender?
[17:47:50] <therealklanni> Just ask your question
[17:48:56] <CiE> Basically i get no events from my json-events.php to show up on the calendar. It is just blank. When i look at the json-events.php it shows the correct json string that should be feeding the calendar and i am not sure what's wrong. i have been at this for 2 days
[17:49:17] <CiE> the calendar shows up fine but it doesn't have any data
[17:49:23] <therealklanni> ?p @ CiE
[17:49:24] <bot-t> CiE, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:49:47] <CiE> what would you like there the json-events?
[17:51:57] <therealklanni> Whatever demonstrates your issue
[17:52:07] <CiE> http://jsfiddle.net/34UnP/
[17:53:30] <therealklanni> I don't see a header() there, but that's side is more of a question for #php. Let's see what's going on with the client side?
[17:53:57] <CiE> http://jsfiddle.net/UxpCq/
[17:54:21] <CiE> the first one was the json-events.php and the second link is the json.html which displays the calendar
[17:55:56] <therealklanni> Hmmm. You seem to be missing the purpose of JSFiddle. The idea is to duplicate the issue, not just paste the code in blindly. Make your code fail in the same way by constructing a demo of what you're trying to do.
[17:56:10] <CiE> ok
[17:56:17] <CiE> can i add both files?
[17:56:37] <therealklanni> You should probably start by reading this: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/
[18:05:01] <CiE> therealklanni does jsfiddle work even though one of the files it needs goes back to a sql database to retrieve info?
[18:05:17] <therealklanni> Only if it's public
[18:05:40] <CiE> they are running in an internal development server
[18:15:23] <hugo_moss> hi im calling a function that i made jQuery.fn.myfunc{}, and im calling it from another js file using parameters to initialize it. when i use this inside the jQuery.fn.myfunc, (like calling $('li').myfunc() ), the this is null, but the li's are there in the page. what could be the problem here?
[18:21:54] <dwieeb> Where's the best place to submit your jQuery plugin? plugins.jquery.com has been down forever.
[18:22:10] <tw2113> best place for what goal?
[18:24:17] <hugo_moss> hey... im calling a function that i made jQuery.fn.myfunc{}, and im calling it from another js file using parameters to initialize it. when i use this inside the jQuery.fn.myfunc, (like calling $('li').myfunc() ), the this is null, but the li's are there in the page. what could be the problem here?
[18:26:16] <dwieeb> tw2113: just to get it popular. It's only on github, and I think it would be useful for people.
[18:27:38] <ryanseddon> dwieeb: plugins site is almost ready to go live again
[18:28:05] <dwieeb> ryanseddon: that's good news. I'll just wait, then.
[18:28:44] <ryanseddon> I'm looking at the staging site right now and it's pretty hot not sure if I'm supposed to share it
[18:29:35] <ryanseddon> but github plays an important part of managing plugins
[18:29:38] <tw2113> get some of the big name blog sites to list it in their "best ___" posts dwieeb
[18:29:53] <tw2113> it's mostly a marketing task at the moment
[18:30:12] <dwieeb> tw2113: okay. =)
[18:47:29] <hugo_moss> i have made a jquery function called jQuery.fn.myfunc(), when i call this function with the selector "li", the this jquery object is null. the li exists. why  is it null?
[19:01:02] <beglol> how to get the id from $("#beg").children()[0];?

[19:01:25] <beglol> oh wait it did
[19:30:21] <gnarf> beglol: $("#beg").children().prop("id") too -- the "getters" only work on the first element anyway
[19:30:34] <gnarf> but [0].id is prolly better anyway
[19:31:34] <beglol> alright

[21:51:59] <jessica> its this now
[21:51:59] <jessica> $(document).load(function() {     loadlist($('select#country').get(0), 'http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/dropdown-ajax/get-list.php?getlist=contactname','contactname'); }
[21:52:24] <Cork> now the code is invalid instead

[21:54:14] <jessica> uhh be back in 30 mins, in case ur code works, just mailo it to me
[21:54:25] <Cork> i won't code your page
[21:54:47] <jessica> worked :)
[21:54:50] <jessica> thanks a ton
[21:55:08] <Cork> when your at it you should fix a list of other things too
[21:55:43] <Cork> 1. use the html5 doctype, no need for the ridiculously long xhtml traditional doctype (it does the same thing anyway)
[21:55:49] <Cork> so just <!doctype html>
[21:56:06] <jessica> kk
[21:56:15] <Cork> 2. when you're selecting on an id, you're already targeting a specific element, so no need for select infront of it
[21:56:21] <jessica> please share contact with me on my email, i'll wait for ur mail
[21:56:24] <Cork> that is just do $('#<the id>')
[21:58:06] <joobie> guys, I have an ajax call that is set to poll every 20 seconds.. when it runs successfully, it then calls a function which runs some code and then calls the itself (the same function) over and over as it gets to the end of the fucntion.. problem is that when the next ajax call runs, i want it to stop the loop that is running on the previous call - how can i do this?
[21:58:50] <joobie> right now it keeps running the old loops ontop of each other.. so i end up with many loops running at the same time, as more and more ajax calls return and fire a new instance of the function
[21:59:11] <joobie> i need the function to run in a loop, but need a way to stop multiple loops running at the same time
[21:59:13] <joobie> any ideas?
[22:05:46] <marinade> Cork, i am getting the following error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[22:06:36] <Cork> ?demo @ marinade
[22:06:37] <bot-t> marinade, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:11:13] <marinade> Cork I am developing it locally :(
[22:13:02] <marinade> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/
[22:13:21] <marinade> i am calling it with this in my global js file $("article").fitVids();
[22:13:25] <marinade> Cork
[22:14:28] <Cork> i don't see any errors on http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/1/
[22:15:46] <marinade> Cork i get 4 errors in chrome Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[22:16:00] <marinade> Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://tamair.com/ from frame with URL http://player.vimeo.com/video/35465995?portrait=0&color=ffffff. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[22:16:09] <marinade> and two more like the last one
[22:16:18] <marinade> and it doesnt resize itself
[22:16:23] <marinade> Cork
[22:17:09] <marinade> the script in the testjsfiddle is in a file in my js folder and my global.js file calls it like this $("article").fitVids();
[22:18:39] <Cork> marinade: ya, you're trying to reach into the content in an iframe loaded from another domain
[22:18:48] <Cork> the browser won't ever allow you to do that
[22:19:52] <marinade> Cork this is my first exp with jquery, can u please say it another way for me :)
[22:19:59] <Cork> if you succeed, you've found a security hole and the vendor would gladly plug it as fast as possible
[22:20:11] <marinade> what about the first error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[22:20:20] <Cork> marinade: scripts from one domain my not access content from another
[22:20:26] <Cork> it has nothing to do with jquery
[22:20:35] <Cork> i don't get that error, so donno what that is
[22:21:35] <marinade> Cork if i add a line debugger and pause it can u be able to tell me what the issue is then?
[22:21:56] <Cork> marinade: i need to see the code that causes it
[22:22:00] <Cork> live working code
[22:22:10] <Cork> i'm not psychic
[22:23:36] <marinade> LOL are u familiar with jquery noconflict?
[22:23:39] <marinade> Cork
[22:23:45] <Cork> sure
[22:24:08] <marinade> i kind of have this guys problem https://github.com/davatron5000/FitVids.js/issues/80
[22:24:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #80 on FitVids.js (Darfuria; 1m, 1d ago): Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[22:24:59] <Cork> so the lib is broken
[22:25:22] <marinade> how can i fix it, u know?
[22:25:49] <marinade> the author is saying somehting about replacing $ with jQuery?
[22:26:09] <Cork> plugins should always use (function($) {})(jQuery); around there code to make them safe for use with noConflict
[22:26:33] <Cork> if you're calling noConflict that means jquery releases the $ variable
[22:26:42] <Cork> and you need to use jQuery to access it
[22:26:48] <marinade> I am developping locally for wordpress site, so im not using a plugin ..
[22:26:58] <Cork> unless you wrap it in said wrapper
[22:27:07] <Cork> you are
[22:27:09] <marinade> i have this line in my global.js file $("article").fitVids();
[22:27:35] <Cork> marinade: $.fn.fitVids = function( options ) { <-- this is a plugin
[22:27:37] <marinade> and then i have the file that is jquery.fitvid.js
[22:28:03] <marinade> ooo ok
[22:28:08] <marinade> so what do you recomend i do
[22:28:17] <Cork> but that plugin is wrapped like it should
[22:28:26] <marinade> the videos are showing up fine but they are not resizing
[22:28:37] <marinade> they are playing but not resizing and showing those 4 errors on chrome
[22:28:44] <Cork> the code you posted is incomplete, so can't tell what happens
[22:28:55] <Cork> you need to replicate the bug/problem
[22:29:33] <Cork> i can't look at a working section of code, and say why another section of code somewhere fails
[22:29:38] <marinade> yea dont know what ahappened there
[22:29:44] <Cork> thats what i meant by i'm not psychic
[22:29:47] <marinade> tru
[22:29:59] <marinade> thnaks for trying tho
[22:30:19] <marinade> u think its a jquery problem tho
[22:30:19] <Cork> marinade: you're calling noConflict in your code?
[22:30:28] <marinade> because fitvids is supposed to alllow it to resize
[22:30:33] <Cork> marinade: no its a problem with your code on your page
[22:30:47] <marinade> im not calling noconflict
[22:30:48] <Cork> marinade: yes, and you have a conflict in your page
[22:31:05] <Cork> and how are you calling the plugin afterwards?
[22:31:16] <marinade> $("article").fitVids();
[22:31:22] <Cork> that won't work
[22:31:24] <marinade> in my global.js file
[22:31:32] <Cork> you've run noConflict; $ isn't jquery
[22:31:34] <marinade> i am following chris coyiers tutorial
[22:31:43] <marinade> lol
[22:31:55] <Cork> ?.noConflict @ marinade
[22:31:55] <bot-t> marinade, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[22:32:18] <Cork> if thats done $ is what ever controlled $ before jquery was loaded
[22:32:34] <Cork> so, ya it won't find jquery or any of its plugins
[22:34:05] <marinade> so i should add <script type="text/javascript">   $.noConflict();   // Code that uses other library's $ can follow here. </script> in my footer?
[22:34:17] <Cork> no
[22:34:23] <marinade> in my global.js file?
[22:34:30] <Cork> you should not use $ for jquery if you're using $.noConflict();
[22:34:31] <marinade> before $("article").fitVids(); ?
[22:34:40] <marinade> oh ok
[22:35:03] <Cork> you should either use (function($) {})(jQuery); around your jquery code (then you can use $)
[22:35:04] <marinade> then what would i change $("article").fitVids(); to?
[22:35:15] <Cork> or use jQuery instead of $
[22:35:49] <marinade> ok so heres what i got. i got the ftvids jquery script on its own so i shouldnt tocuh that right
[22:36:01] <marinade> I want to basically go teh replace the $ with jQuery route
[22:36:04] <Cork> yes, its already wrapped and safe
[22:36:10] <Cork> uh...
[22:36:20] <Cork> marinade: did you even read what i answered you?
[22:36:29] <Cork> the problem isn't in your plugin
[22:36:33] <Cork> its in your own code
[22:36:39] <marinade> in the html?
[22:36:46] <Cork> kinda
[22:36:50] <Cork> the code you didn't show me
[22:37:04] <marinade> so the problem is in my global.js fiel where right now i ahve $("article").fitVids();
[22:37:10] <Cork> yes
[22:37:20] <Cork> thats where you should to one of those two options
[22:37:39] <Cork> what rout is the be best depends on how many calls your doing
[22:37:46] <Cork> for just one jQuery is the best
[22:37:48] <marinade> so i change it to jQuery("article").fitVids();
[22:37:58] <Cork> if your doing a lot the wrapper is prob the best
[22:38:16] <marinade> well i may want to use more calls in the future
[22:38:30] <marinade> so how do i go about the wrapper way
[22:38:39] <marinade> i take (function($) {})(jQuery);
[22:38:45] <Cork> you can change that when you need it
[22:39:02] <Cork> and there is nothing preventing you from using jQuery() how many times you want
[22:39:22] <Cork> it can just be easier to read if you have larg sections that does it (sal 15+ lines)
[22:39:29] <Cork> sal==say
[22:39:39] <marinade> ok LOl
[22:39:52] <marinade> so i changed it tojQuery("article").fitVids();
[22:39:57] <marinade> now do i chagne the html?
[22:40:07] <Cork> what html?
[22:40:07] <howardgrigg> hi guys - easy question: in the done function following an ajax request how can i reference the object that was clicked on? 'this' seems to be undefined
[22:40:22] <marinade> so i shouldnt touch the iframe etc. in html
[22:40:23] <marinade> ?
[22:40:31] <howardgrigg> i want to append the response to the object that was clicked on
[22:40:32] <Cork> howardgrigg: you can define a context for the ajax call
[22:40:36] <Cork> ?.ajax
[22:40:37] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:41:06] <marinade> COrk are you suggesting that jQuery("article").fitVids(); is the only change i needed to make?
[22:41:13] <Cork> yes
[22:41:19] <marinade> :(
[22:41:30] <howardgrigg> Cork: cool looking into it now
[22:41:39] <marinade> i stil ahve the 4 errors
[22:41:45] <Cork> and those are?
[22:42:09] <marinade> the same as before
[22:42:28] <Cork> marinade: try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[22:42:28] <marinade> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[22:42:41] <Cork> posting the plugin code and nothing else doesn't help at all
[22:42:54] <Cork> try to reproduce the problem you have, then i can help
[22:42:54] <marinade> Cork how can i do that because here i have a fitvid.js file and i am calling it in a global.js file
[22:43:05] <marinade> how would i be able to reproduce that oin jsfiddle?
[22:43:10] <Cork> js doesn't care about files
[22:43:23] <Cork> you can copy the relevant sections and have them in the script section
[22:43:49] <marinade> so where would i paste jQuery("article").fitVids(); in http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/1/
[22:44:29] <Cork> set the script type to head, and then run it in the same manner you're loading it in your page
[22:56:42] <marinade> Cork whats the latest version?
[22:56:45] <marinade> of jquery?
[22:57:08] <marinade> nvm
[22:57:48] <Cork> 1.8.2 or something like that
[23:05:46] <marinade> Cork i updated to latest jquery but i get GET http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3/jquery.min.js 404 (Not Found)
[23:06:25] <Cork> are you trying to load jquery from the download server to your live page?
[23:06:28] <Cork> thats a bad idea
[23:06:41] <Cork> that url isn't cdn distributed
[23:06:45] <Cork> so it can be really slow
[23:07:04] <Cork> and latest is 1.8.2 not 1.8.3
[23:07:09] <joobie> guys
[23:07:26] <joobie> im using scrollTo to move an iframe to a particular vertical position
[23:07:37] <joobie> and then fadein() to show the iframe
[23:07:39] <marinade> Cork it got released yesterday
[23:07:53] <Cork> its not officially released at least
[23:08:01] <joobie> problem is as fadein is starting, i can see the scrollTo move to the scroll position
[23:08:24] <joobie> how can i make it so that the scrollto is done, then when fadein starts it doesnt see the movement of the scrollto?
[23:08:28] <marinade> so i should change it back to 1.8.2 for that error to go away?
[23:08:38] <joobie> i think it's just happening a bit too quick the fadein and it's capturing the scrollto
[23:08:56] <Cork> marinade: you should change to 1.8.2, AND to a cdn server yes
[23:09:01] <Cork> http://jquery.com/download/
[23:09:08] <Cork> NOT the code.jquery.com address
[23:09:31] <Cork> thats for downloading it if you want to host it your self
[23:09:50] <marinade> so Cork u are suggesting i host it myself?
[23:09:53] <marinade> by downloading it?
[23:10:46] <Cork> marinade: please try to read all the comments i give, not just bits and pieces
[23:10:54] <marinade> ok
[23:11:14] <Cork> marinade: over and over again i've already answered your question when you ask them again
[23:11:27] <marinade> i used code.jquery because im folowing chris coyiers tutorial from css-tricks
[23:11:44] <marinade> yea u are really one of the more patient ppl i hvae met
[23:11:47] <Cork> sounds like that tutorial is really broken
[23:12:26] <marinade> LOL he doesnt get any error so he moves on but i do and then have to fiugre it out. And already some things get outdated naturally
[23:12:46] <marinade> hes using codekit im using scoutapp
[23:12:52] <Cork> well he's doing things in bad ways, thats what i meant
[23:13:03] <Cork> they work, but they have problems
[23:13:03] <marinade> oo
[23:13:39] <Cork> you can load jquery from code.jquery.com, but sometimes you will have like several seconds loading time cause that server gets hammered
[23:13:43] <Cork> and isn't meant for the load
[23:13:56] <Cork> thats why you should either host it your self, or use a cdn
[23:14:38] <Cork> cdn servers is built to handle the high load from several thousand of sites pointing millions of users towards htem
[23:14:49] <Cork> *them
[23:17:28] <marinade> ok thanks a lot for that
[23:17:40] <marinade> how come the video does not resize here http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/2/
[23:18:16] <Cork> your not loading the plugin
[23:18:19] <marinade> Cork
[23:18:32] <Cork> so fitVids isn't defined
[23:19:22] <marinade> how abotu now http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/3/
[23:19:35] <marinade> if u notice ive added fitvids to the resources
[23:19:45] <Cork> you're still not loading the plugin
[23:20:07] <Cork> hmm
[23:20:08] <Cork> ah
[23:20:09] <marinade> how would i load it ?
[23:20:12] <Cork> lets check
[23:21:44] <Cork> you can't load script files from github
[23:21:57] <Cork> it sends the wrong content-type header
[23:23:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/5/
[23:27:26] <Cork> marinade: but anyway that script won't ever work
[23:27:47] <Cork> you're crossing domain boundaries so the selector that plugin uses won't ever work
[23:27:50] <EnginA> I don't think jQ can reliably raise a timeout event for Ajax requests, right ?
[23:28:17] <Cork> EnginA: you mean make it heigher then normal?
[23:28:37] <Cork> or to actially raise an exception?
[23:28:49] <EnginA> raise an exception
[23:29:08] <Cork> you can set the timeout in the ajax call
[23:29:16] <Cork> ?.ajax @ EnginA
[23:29:19] <bot-t> EnginA, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[23:30:14] <EnginA> in this case, I'm using getScript because it's cross domain
[23:30:42] <Cork> ah, well ajax is whats used below anyway
[23:30:46] <EnginA> and the whole technique is basically a workaround with no error handling at all
[23:30:47] <Cork> .ajax that is
[23:31:07] <Cork> but cross domain you can still get error handling
[23:31:09] <EnginA> but script does not use XHR objects with error handling etc
[23:31:16] <EnginA> hmm
[23:31:16] <Cork> but you can't affect timeout
[23:31:21] <EnginA> I don't care
[23:31:24] <EnginA> about that
[23:31:36] <Cork> EnginA: yes its not xhr, but everything you do with ajax is xhr
[23:31:49] <Cork> *but not everything
[23:32:14] <Cork> EnginA: getScript, and cross domain calls with .ajax both use <script> tags
[23:32:46] <EnginA> ok, i better just read
[23:32:47] <EnginA> :)
[23:35:03] <marinade> Coyier seems to make it work :(
[23:35:25] <Cork> marinade: its not doable in modern browsers
[23:35:28] <marinade> in the tutorial he mentions that its not his problem but vimeos problem
[23:35:52] <marinade> Cork how does it work here though http://jsfiddle.net/nAXXY/42/
[23:37:58] <Cork> ah wait did i read that selector wrong...
[23:38:31] <Cork> ah it merges them with comma not space -_-'
[23:38:40] * Cork reads through the plugin again
[23:39:51] <Cork> ok, so it adjusts the iframe to be 100% not the content
[23:39:54] <Cork> thats doable
[23:40:01] <marinade> lol do work bro please so i can go to sleep and make it on time to class tomomrw
[23:40:33] <EnginA> Cork: I sent a getScript request to an invalid host, fail method is not called.
[23:40:52] <EnginA> and I can see that the request is cancelled after an amount of time in the chrome developer tools
[23:43:27] <EnginA> the reason I'm particularly picky on this is that I can implement my own timeout scheme but can generate false positives
[23:44:00] <EnginA> i.e. my timeout expires than answers come... that'd change the app loop I'M designing and craete race conditions
[23:47:46] <marinade> Cork any idea ?
[23:48:22] <Cork> the selector fails and i'm trying to find why
[23:51:04] <marinade> yea i was thinking it had somethign to do wiht that but i couldnt fix it
[23:53:10] <Cork> marinade: http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/10/
[23:55:19] <marinade> Cork what did you change?
[23:55:24] <marinade> the part after plugin ends?
[23:55:30] <Cork> actually the extra load isn't needed http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/11/
[23:55:36] <Cork> you didn't wait for dom ready
[23:55:40] <Cork> so the article didn't exist
[23:56:05] <Cork> so ya basically jQuery(function($) { is the difference
[23:57:50] <marinade> ahh it doesnt work :(
[23:58:05] <marinade> shucks thanks for trying bro i have no idea what to do from here
[23:58:21] <marinade> it just doesnt resize
[23:58:21] <EnginA> haha error handling does not even work with 404 errors, I'm curious when it is fired
[23:58:59] <marinade> Cork u think its simply changing from a class to a selector?
[23:59:13] <Cork> no
[23:59:28] <Cork> all i did was make it wait for the dom to be stable
