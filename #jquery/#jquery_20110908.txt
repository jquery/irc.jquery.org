[00:00:41] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: thank you!
[00:01:04] <Cork> heh i guess it worked? :D
[00:01:27] <zdk> muzone:  :) hi
[00:02:05] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I need to understand a logic.. I am using .hover to show/hide a 'ul'. now, that ul contains childe uls too.. It is working fine but I am surprised about that when I am hovering on child, why the parent is not hiding!! as there is a .hide used in hover out..
[00:02:06] <Paveloosha> $(" .nav li").hover(function(){ 		$(this).find('ul:first').css({visibility: "visible",display: "none"}).fadeIn(800); 		},function(){ 		$(this).find('ul:first').css({visibility: "hidden"}); 		});
[00:03:03] <Cork> Paveloosha: cause your tecnically still hovering the parent
[00:03:19] <Cork> every child element propagates the event up to its parent
[00:03:36] <Cork> so as long as your hovering a child the parent will still show it
[00:03:43] <Paveloosha> <Cork>, will it same for mouseover and out?
[00:04:08] <Cork> mouseenter and mouseleave, but not mouseover and out
[00:04:50] <Paveloosha> what is the basic diffrence between them?
[00:05:06] <Paveloosha> it seems same action, right?
[00:05:29] <Cork> ?.mouseenter @ Paveloosha
[00:05:29] <bot-t> Paveloosha, .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[00:05:38] <Paveloosha> I mean mouseover and mouseenter..
[00:05:39] <Cork> theres a demo ther
[00:05:45] <Cork> try moving the cursor over them
[00:05:48] <tonyjcamp> muzone:  http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/8/  hawkish but works.
[00:05:53] <tonyjcamp> hackish*
[00:06:21] <Cork> wtf...
[00:06:55] <Cork> something looks broken there...
[00:07:04] <Paveloosha> bot-t, when I am entering on an eliment it also over on element, no?
[00:07:05] <bot-t> Paveloosha, Very doubtful.
[00:07:13] <muzone> oh man..
[00:07:24] <muzone> that is really really cool tonyjcamp
[00:07:26] <muzone> you know what, fuck it
[00:07:29] * muzone pops the champagne
[00:07:34] <tonyjcamp> lol
[00:07:49] <Cork> Paveloosha: looking over things, hover should behave the same as mouseover/out
[00:08:17] <Cork> Paveloosha: but over/out looks like it does the same thing as enter/leave witch is wrong
[00:09:14] <Paveloosha> <Cork>, but if i use over and out, I can see it is firing out handler when I am leaving parent..
[00:09:37] <Paveloosha> and everything is hiding..
[00:09:43] <Cork> Paveloosha: the demo i talked about
[00:10:24] <Paveloosha> checking it..
[00:13:33] <webguynow> got some weirdness looping through a 2-level deep JSON object - can I get a little help
[00:13:46] <webguynow> http://pastebin.com/A7EXcp5K
[00:17:09] <Cork> Paveloosha: ah, forgot parts of what i just talked about XD
[00:17:18] <Cork> Paveloosha: here should explain a bit more http://jsfiddle.net/2sAvx/
[00:17:43] <Cork> Paveloosha: you need to stop the event from propagating to the parent
[00:26:51] <Paveloosha> <Cork>, sorry, I was out side.. okay I am checking fiddle..
[00:45:03] <Paveloosha> Cork, now I think I understand the matter.. mouseenter works until I am inside the area of that element but mouseover only works when I am over that element.. so when I am over a child, it means I am over on child not parent.. Is my findings correct?
[00:45:28] <Cork> Paveloosha: yes
[00:45:47] <Cork> and the event normally propagate to the parent so it gets a mouseover when you enter the child
[00:46:33] <Paveloosha> great.. thanks a lot <Cork>? Thanks <bot-t>..
[00:46:46] <Cork> heh np
[01:02:34] <gianiaz> hi
[01:03:12] <gianiaz> There's an easy way to select the first enabled tab of a jquery tab plugin?
[01:03:12] <eighty4> When using animate combined with timers it seems like the animations is "stacked" if the window isn't showing. This causes some strange animations once the focus is returned. What's the best solution for this? Checking the focus and not animate doesn't seem like the best solution since focus will be lost when, for instance irc:ing, even if I can see the browser window
[01:04:35] <nail_> put tits on the page, never loose focus
[01:04:43] <gianiaz> LOL
[01:29:11] <shellox_> hi
[01:29:33] <shellox_> how to append the content of an existing div with jquery?
[01:29:56] <blackspotwiggins> ?append @ shellox_
[01:29:56] <bot-t> shellox_, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[01:30:08] <shellox_> $(".main").append('#mydiv')
[01:30:32] <johanhar> Hi. How can I find all divs and do a function on it? As with each ... :) The examples used on .find only does one thing to the found element, like a .css or .hide or something ...
[01:31:16] <blackspotwiggins> shellox_, if you look carefully, you need to actually select the element you want to append
[01:31:27] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise it's treated as html text
[01:31:36] <shellox_> blackspotwiggins: i just mean whats the best way to do it, i read the docs
[01:34:32] <pallet> Hi all
[01:34:48] <pallet> with jQuery, can I dynamically rename a DIV ID ?
[01:40:58] <ServerSage> pallet: You could use $(this).attr('id', 'new value') I think.
[01:41:26] <Cork> yup
[01:56:50] <[1]bob> Hi, when you set a click function on an id, is there a way to call that function without clicking ? (e.g : drop down menu on click but can be triggered without clicking)
[02:06:35] <Todd_LEFTART> $(ele).click() will trigger click event of ele manually, is that what you are looking for?
[02:09:00] <rasputnik> hi, i'm using getJSON to poll periodically. is there a 'right' way to detect what's changed in the object tree I've got back?
[02:09:42] <ximmr> hi all, I want to find out, how many visible and checked checkboxes there are in my form. the checkboxes have the class flag. $(".flag[visible=true][checked=true]").length always shows 0. Where is the mistake?
[02:11:45] <blackspotwiggins> ximmr, visible is not an attribute
[02:12:00] <ximmr> hmm is it display?
[02:12:51] <blackspotwiggins> do you write <input display="true"> in html?
[02:14:09] <ximmr> sometimes, yes ;) $(".driverFlag[checked=true]:visible").length is the one that works :D
[02:14:41] <blackspotwiggins> ximmr, lrn2html. also, there is :checked available in jquery
[02:16:03] <ximmr> its more learn to select
[02:19:00] <[1]bob> Thx Todd_LEFTART
[02:22:17] <eax> Hey there, I have a pop-up shower with a callback like: onClose:function() - But, I need it to run location.reload() on that callback. How would I go about this?
[02:23:38] <eax> DIsregard, found out :) INstead of having onClose:function, I just used: onClose: location.reload()
[02:24:21] <blackspotwiggins> haha
[02:31:05] <calvinmcgee1> I need some quick help. Check website: http://demo.wallmanderco.se/thenberg/ . Why isn't the script working. Gets an "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'customSlider'"
[02:32:15] <calvinmcgee1> It worked fine minutes ago
[02:34:29] <discorpia> calvinmcgee1: hmm, seems to be something in the execution pipeline, if re-included/run manually through firebug console it works fine.
[02:35:07] <Trisox> $('.custom-slider').customSlider(); works
[02:35:10] <discorpia> calvinmcgee1: it shouldn't matter since it's wrapped in .ready(), but try putting javascript.js last
[02:35:11] <Trisox> if i run that lol
[02:35:30] <Trisox> it gives me http://demo.wallmanderco.se/thenberg/wp-content/themes/tbTheme/img/bild1start_ny.jpg
[02:35:56] <discorpia> Trisox: yeah, you're right
[02:36:20] <lamih> Hi all
[02:36:30] <Trisox> ;)
[02:36:45] <Trisox> and i see 1086  top left
[02:36:47] <calvinmcgee1> I will try putting it last. Maybe I should wrap it in noconflict
[02:37:19] <Trisox> dunno
[02:37:29] <BlaDe^> what's the best way to call a URL ? i just want to trigger it don't care about the response...
[02:37:32] <BlaDe^> $.get() ?
[02:38:18] <Trisox> best way to trigger a url is with <a href="www.yourUrl.com"> www.yourUrl.com</a>
[02:38:45] <Trisox> ?load
[02:38:45] <bot-t1> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[02:41:19] <lamih> Trisox: I search to select all thing where the class start by lu_ and who containt the word "1"
[02:41:49] <lamih> It's for the Isotope plugin for make a filter with dynamic word
[02:42:33] <Trisox> isee
[02:42:38] <lamih> In fact, it's just the first part of the selector who doesn't work,

[02:43:32] <Trisox> you dont need the =
[02:43:43] <Trisox> w8 you do

[02:45:14] <troubleman> How do I make http://jsfiddle.net/u9YhJ/ cycle like the images at http://www.asos.com/Women/?
[02:45:15] <lamih> Okay, but it's not for OR operator, and no the AND operator ?
[02:45:39] <Trisox> mmm
[02:45:54] <lamih> Yes, it's for OR operator :/
[02:46:07] <blackspotwiggins> remove , ?

[02:47:03] <Clex> Hi. Do anybody knows a jQuery plugin doing exactly this: http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/drag-drop-nodes/drag-drop-nodes-demo2.html ?
[02:47:33] <timing> Clex: draggables and droppables and sortables from jqueryui
[02:47:52] <Trisox> lamih like this http://jsbin.com/ejuzi/edit#javascript,html,live ?
[02:48:11] <Trisox> what timing said
[02:48:58] <bronchame> please check out http://jsfiddle.net/3uDGT/
[02:49:19] <bronchame> the appended divs are not showing the close image on hover
[02:49:22] <lamih> I don't see anything on your link Trisox
[02:49:30] <Clex> Well, there's no example with the littles boxes.
[02:49:34] <Trisox> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2416803/jquery-contains-selector-to-search-for-multiple-strings/2417076#2417076
[02:49:53] <Cork> ?.live @ bronchame
[02:49:53] <bot-t1> bronchame, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:50:03] <Clex> Jquery UI target boxes do not auto-center the dropped object.
[02:50:04] <calvinmcgee1> Now it says that it's not a function when I try from the console: http://demo.wallmanderco.se/thenberg/
[02:50:06] <blackspotwiggins> lamih, if nothing is found, then nothing matches the selector
[02:50:09] <blackspotwiggins> simple as that
[02:50:24] <blackspotwiggins> fix your markup/selector
[02:50:39] <timing> Clex: what do you mean with autocenter?
[02:50:55] <lamih> Oh ! it's with ":" and no "," !!
[02:51:43] <bronchame> bot-t1 thanx.. I just forgot about it.. http://jsfiddle.net/3uDGT/ now works like a charm :)
[02:51:49] <bronchame> thanks
[02:52:07] <Clex> timing: in the example I linked the elements are dropped in boxes.
[02:52:19] <Clex> Well placed.
[02:53:23] <troubleman> How do I make my carousel at http://jsfiddle.net/u9YhJ/1/ behave like http://www.asos.com/Women/?xr=1&xmk=VOID&r=1&mk=na - anyone know? I'm almost there!
[02:55:18] <_srp> Hi, im using jquery nivo slider.. i want the slider to select images from  my folder.. how do i do this..?? please help..
[02:57:03] <troubleman> _srp: why nivo and not jquery cycle?
[02:57:39] <_srp> troubleman: I'm using a wordpress theme.. it uses nivo..
[02:57:53] <bronchame> _srp you can assign images to your slider via php or whatever you are coding on
[02:58:26] <troubleman> Cool _srp
[02:58:50] <troubleman> bronchame: Thanks for helping my friend _srp!
[02:59:28] <_srp> bronchame: so i need to look for the php which loads the images to nivo is it?
[03:00:05] <Trisox> lamih: any luck
[03:00:06] <lamih> Look this http://jsbin.com/ojucas/3/edit, it doesn't work, I rage with my selector ><
[03:00:11] <bronchame> _srp you want the slider to  pick random images in runtime?
[03:00:31] <_srp> bronchame: yes.. exactly..
[03:00:33] <Trisox> it are id's
[03:00:35] <Trisox> lamih:
[03:00:45] <Trisox> not classes
[03:00:50] <lamih> Sorry ^^'
[03:00:53] <Trisox> $('li[id^=3]:contains("John")') works
[03:00:59] <Trisox> lamih: wake up
[03:01:36] <lamih> Yes, you are right ...
[03:01:46] <bronchame> _srp thats gonna be little tricky
[03:01:47] <lamih> thank you a lot Trisox for your help
[03:01:58] <Trisox> np
[03:02:08] <Trisox> i hope this helps you
[03:02:40] <bronchame> slider works on client side so the client's browser will require to download all those images
[03:02:41] <Trisox> bronchame: random picks from an array could work
[03:03:02] <bronchame> _srp Trisox is right
[03:03:24] <Trisox> set images in array set start image ..
[03:03:34] <Trisox> would take some time to make
[03:03:46] <Trisox> prob a slider out there that already can do it
[03:03:54] <iateadonut> how do i make animations of two elements happen at the same time - is there a way besides making two functions that start on document.ready?  and also, how do i return elements to their original position after the animation is complete?
[03:03:57] <bronchame> Its the same thing
[03:04:10] <bronchame> you place the images you want in slider in the img tag
[03:04:24] <bronchame> works exactly like array
[03:05:01] <Trisox> http://dev7studios.com/support/#/discussion/comment/129/ <-- if using nivoslider
[03:05:58] <Trisox> iateadonut: sure http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:06:03] <Trisox> queue: A Boolean indicating whether to place the animation in the effects queue. If false, the animation will begin immediately.
[03:06:25] <Trisox> so... you can start 2 at the same time..
[03:08:34] <Trisox> iateadonut: to original capture your original position in a var before animation
[03:08:48] <Trisox> and call it back with animation using the var.. for position
[03:09:18] <Trisox> like var originTop = offset.top; and after 'top': originTop...
[03:17:52] <Derppy> Is there any way to debug getJSON? $.getJSON($(".product_carousel").attr("data-source"), function(data){ alert("foo") }); does nothing, but I'm sure the element contains data-source attribute and it points to the JSON file. Don't get any kind of error either.
[03:18:47] <Cork> Derppy: first you can use .data instead of attr('data-
[03:19:02] <Trisox> :L
[03:19:04] <Trisox> :D
[03:19:18] <Trisox> easy mistake to make ;)
[03:19:44] <Cork> Derppy: other then that; inspect it in the development console of your browser
[03:20:08] <Cork> Derppy: might be something like your doing a cross domain call
[03:20:14] <Cork> or the url isn't found
[03:20:22] <Cork> json can't be parsed
[03:20:24] <Cork> or so on
[03:20:42] <Derppy> Cork: Ok, so there's not supposed to be any sort of javascript error or warning about it?
[03:21:00] <Cork> Derppy: not in getJSON
[03:21:06] <Cork> .ajax have those
[03:21:28] <Cork> $.ajax({ url:, type: 'json', error: function() {}
[03:21:37] <bronchame> cork remember the append textarea problem i ran into
[03:21:38] <bronchame> http://jsfiddle.net/3uDGT/
[03:21:45] <troubleman> How do I incorporate the scrollLeft transition from https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.all.js into http://jsfiddle.net/9aabA/? I tried incorporating it into jquery.cycle.lite.js - http://jsfiddle.net/jqwnh/ - but no luck so far.
[03:22:12] <bronchame> thats a form
[03:22:14] <troubleman> The lite version is only 4KB compared to the 24KB full version, and naturally I wouldn't wanna serve my users a bunch of transition effects they'll never get to see!
[03:22:15] <Cork> bronchame: ya, and you still need to use live
[03:22:30] <bronchame> no that part is working for me now
[03:22:38] <bronchame> now I am using jquery form validation at document.ready
[03:22:51] <bronchame> these appended textarea are not getting validated
[03:23:05] <bronchame> the first hardcoded one is being validated
[03:23:19] <bronchame> but these appended textareas are not
[03:23:19] <Cork> ... see earlier answer...
[03:23:34] <Trisox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQp5l4-sfFA :D
[03:23:37] <Cork> when you add new elements to the dom, old selectors won't select them
[03:24:01] <Cork> live binds to the body, and listens for bubbling events so it can do it
[03:24:10] <Cork> but normal events bind directly on the selected element
[03:24:18] <Cork> so a newly added one won't have the listner
[03:24:27] <bronchame> hmmm let me check modifying the validation call itself
[03:24:33] <bronchame> 1 sec
[03:24:37] <Trisox> thnx Cork saves me some typing ;)
[03:25:01] <anger> What is the best way to search links to a url with jquery?
[03:25:20] <Cork> anger: links to an url?
[03:25:24] <anger> Trying to find if a page has a link to itself
[03:25:26] <troubleman> Trisox: haha
[03:25:27] <Cork> you mean find links based on its href?
[03:25:30] <Trisox> :D
[03:26:21] <Trisox> location.pathname
[03:26:54] <Trisox> like window.location.pathname
[03:27:04] <Trisox> let me google you something
[03:27:09] <anger> Just wondering if I need to loop all A's with $('a') or is there more sophisticated way
[03:27:14] <Derppy> Cork: Ok, so I found it when I used $.ajax. JSON: 501 (Method Not Implemented). However, another getJSON on the page works perfectly. Any idea what could cause this?
[03:27:15] <Trisox> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/get-url-and-url-parts-in-javascript/
[03:27:22] <nail_> more like $('a[href^=...]')
[03:27:36] <bronchame> hold on i am gonna post the code to the fiddle
[03:27:50] <juria_roberts> heyy
[03:27:51] <Trisox> nail_: true but you need first the current url
[03:27:52] <juria_roberts> http://pastie.org/2502098
[03:28:08] <nail_> ah sorry, I didnt see the "to itself"
[03:28:20] <juria_roberts> in the above code location.href is http://testadmin.skenzo.com/cm/reports/index.php?report_id=15&start_date=20110901&end_date=20110930&period=thismonth&clickURLType=Root
[03:28:57] <Trisox> ;) hehe
[03:29:12] <Trisox> any who lunch
[03:29:17] <juria_roberts> yet when the executes i see http://testadmin.skenzo.com/cm/reports/index.php?group_id=15
[03:29:34] <nail_> Derppy: that 501 means you try to do a GET on a url that doesn't accept GET
[03:29:35] <troubleman> How do I incorporate the scrollLeft transition from https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.all.js into http://jsfiddle.net/9aabA/? I tried modifying jquery.cycle.lite.js - http://jsfiddle.net/XFYkG/ - but that didn't go very well. I just don't wanna load 20KB of unneeded effects into my website (4KB lite version vs 24KB full version)..
[03:29:37] <anger> nail_: ok, looks promising, should it work like this $('a[href^=foo.html]').each(...)?
[03:29:42] <juria_roberts> on my browser
[03:30:00] <nail_> anger ^= means "starts with", but there are other operators, depending on your needs
[03:30:06] <Trisox> anger: in combo with my link http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/get-url-and-url-parts-in-javascript/
[03:30:11] <Trisox> your make it dynamic
[03:30:13] <Trisox> lunchh
[03:30:18] <juria_roberts> shudnt it take me to location.href
[03:30:46] <Derppy> nail_: How come other getJSON on the page works, which points to the same directory?
[03:31:48] <anger> nail_: basically I should be able to match relative urls too...
[03:31:48] <Derppy> nail_: Seems I get the error from both JSON files, but for some reason the other works fine with getJSON.
[03:32:40] <anger> And for some reason my script stops functioning when I write $('a[href^=foo.html]')
[03:33:02] <mazzachre> Does jquerymobile really break stylesheets? I have tried to override the style for ui-btn-active up-btn-up-a to make new colors for my navbar (without making a full new css) yet it seems it is completely ignored (I add it as a stylesheet after the first one is loaded) so is it something jquerymobile does in it's mangling? And can I change that behaviour?
[03:34:11] <juria_roberts> please help
[03:34:23] <bronchame> http://jsfiddle.net/UfxaX/

[03:41:05] <juria_roberts> can any1 help me?
[03:44:24] <bronchame> juria_roberts can u post more specific code?
[03:46:23] <Nomikos> Is "$(document).ready(function(){" still needed, and/or is there a shorter version?
[03:46:44] <blackspotwiggins> Nomikos, "$(function() {" is equivalent
[03:47:13] <Nomikos> Ah, thanks
[03:57:35] <varnie> hello. how to simplify the following? http://pastie.org/2502200
[03:57:56] <varnie> I am sure smth can be improved because it is my first experience in using jquery :)
[03:59:19] <xec> varnie: you're looping through each tr to find the first one? :)
[03:59:22] <donCams> varnie
[03:59:48] <xec> and "document" is supposed to be without quotes?
[03:59:50] <donCams> $('#t tr').find('td:first').is('c a').removeClass('c a');
[04:00:08] <donCams> hmmm.. might be wrong. wooot
[04:00:51] <discorpia> varnie: there is .hasClass() and .toggleClass() which might be of interest to you
[04:00:54] <varnie> xec, actually there's a single tr and td within it.
[04:01:10] <xec> varnie: ah right
[04:01:56] <xec> varnie: you always want class "c" present and toggle "a"?
[04:02:06] <varnie> yes
[04:02:07] <xec> or vice versa
[04:02:13] <varnie> you're right
[04:02:15] <misterm> varnie: is the structure of the document changing?
[04:02:20] <varnie> "c" or "a c"
[04:02:24] <varnie> no
[04:02:42] <misterm> varnie: if you're always working on the same elements, you can just cache them instead of looking it up each time
[04:02:44] <varnie> all I need is to change a style of that table's td using these two styles
[04:03:34] <misterm> varnie: not really a big deal in this example, but a good habit to get into
[04:03:45] <varnie> $("document") must be $(document). correct?
[04:03:49] <xec> right
[04:03:53] <varnie> but what about the inner $("button")?
[04:04:03] <varnie> should it be without " as well?
[04:04:04] <misterm> varnie: you can just do $(function(){}) instead as well
[04:04:15] <xec> $("button") selects <button> if that is what you want
[04:04:21] <varnie> yes
[04:04:48] <varnie> so it is okay to leave it $("button") //okay?
[04:05:00] <xec> yes
[04:05:30] <varnie> thank you
[04:07:46] <xec> varnie: maybe something like this? (untested) http://jsfiddle.net/gdHEZ/
[04:08:38] <toxz> if i do a getScript for a file which contains also a getScript, how can i wait in the first getScript for the callback of the getScript in the included script? any ideas? :-(
[04:08:40] <mekwall> varnie: jQuery selectors will default to document, $("div") is the same as $("div", document") or $(document").find("div")
[04:08:46] <xec> varnie: or http://jsfiddle.net/gdHEZ/1/
[04:11:30] <mekwall> xec: looks good ;) using good practices there
[04:11:54] <varnie> one moment pls
[04:13:07] <aaronmcadam> is it safe to use getScript to get google analytics?
[04:13:09] * Trisox starts in a waiting music
[04:13:37] <Trisox> wy you wannna do that aaronmcadam
[04:14:05] <varnie> and how to gain switching between classNames?
[04:14:18] <varnie> xec, could you clarify?
[04:14:22] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: yup
[04:14:33] <xec> varnie: http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[04:14:45] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ga
[04:14:48] <mekwall> check it out
[04:15:06] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: implements the ga api jquery-style
[04:15:07] <varnie> http://pastie.org/2502270
[04:15:08] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, just use their own snippet, it's pretty sweet
[04:15:17] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: boo!
[04:15:20] <lamih> Hum ... someone can help me ? I have again a problem with Jquery Selector
[04:15:21] <varnie> I extended your code-snipped and now it doesn't work in action
[04:15:27] <blackspotwiggins> oh wait, sry
[04:15:29] <varnie> maybe I misunderstood smth
[04:15:37] <blackspotwiggins> needs moar plugin addon extra widgets
[04:15:40] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise not cool
[04:16:07] <aaronmcadam> hmm?
[04:16:14] <varnie> nevermind, all is okay.
[04:16:19] <varnie> thank you again, xec;)
[04:16:26] <aaronmcadam> I'm writing my own analytics module
[04:16:29] <xec> varnie: read up on the toggleClass method i linked you, does the hard work of checking class names for you
[04:16:35] <aaronmcadam> and want to just load the script inside it
[04:16:54] <xec> varnie: also, i called the var everyFirstTd , not everyFirstId
[04:16:56] <varnie> okay I will read
[04:17:00] <aaronmcadam> var ga = $.getScript( 'https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js' );
[04:18:18] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: check my jquery ga plugin and you'll don't have to ;)
[04:18:25] <lamih> If I have understand, if I want several class in a Div, I put a space between ? But Jquery understand that ? http://jsbin.com/ojucas/5/edit#javascript,html,live it's a example
[04:18:34] <aaronmcadam> I've already written it hah
[04:18:43] <mekwall> reinventing the wheel ftw
[04:19:16] <aaronmcadam> I'd already invented it before asking in here :P hehe
[04:19:35] <xec> i find a lot of "wheels" to be realtively unsuitable for certain purposes
[04:19:36] <aaronmcadam> just wanted to have the code part of my framework
[04:19:46] <xec> it's more like square wheels ;D
[04:20:04] <varnie> xec, but I still have to perform checkings
[04:20:04] <xec> gotta work at it to make them go round
[04:20:10] <lamih> someone for help me ? :/
[04:20:21] <varnie> how do I'll know should it delete or add "a"?
[04:20:39] <mekwall> varnie: tell me exactly what you want to do
[04:20:54] <Trisox> 2
[04:20:58] <mekwall> varnie: you want to delete .a when its both .a.c?
[04:20:58] <xec> varnie: toggleClass will remove it if it is present, and add it if it is not
[04:21:04] <varnie> if theTD className == 'a' make it 'a c' and vice versa
[04:21:34] <mekwall> varnie: you mean when it has both it should remove a?
[04:21:36] <aaronmcadam> think i can bastardise it
[04:21:38] <mekwall> varnie: it will always have c?
[04:21:43] <varnie> switching, in other words;) I made it already using "if branch"
[04:21:46] <varnie> mekwall, yes, exactly
[04:22:06] <xec> varnie: if you need the "a" class to only ever apply to td's with class "c", include it in the original selector
[04:22:25] <xec> varnie: like var everyFirstTd = $("#t tr td.c:first");
[04:22:26] <mekwall> varnie: why doesn't .toggleClass("a") work then?
[04:22:31] <xec> or something like that
[04:22:56] <varnie> mekWall, I should check whether it hasn't been set already
[04:23:04] <mekwall> varnie: why?
[04:23:22] <mekwall> we can't help you if you don't give us all the details
[04:23:45] <varnie> suppose, it is already "c", then I should make it "a c"
[04:23:49] <xec> agreed, maybe tell us what you want the end result to be, and the context
[04:23:50] <mekwall> what you are saying now is... "I have to get out of my car" ... and we answer with "Open the door and get out?" ... and then you say "But it has no doors"
[04:23:58] <varnie> in case it is "c" I should make it "a c"
[04:24:21] <xec> and if it is "a c"?
[04:24:28] <mekwall> varnie: remove a ? :)
[04:24:32] <varnie> yes
[04:24:35] <mekwall> lol
[04:24:47] <xec> toggleClass("a") will do that
[04:25:00] <varnie> "c -> a c"; "a c -> "c"
[04:25:06] <xec> it will not touch any other classes, such as c
[04:25:38] <xec> try it and see ;)
[04:25:42] <Trisox> just read the basic's ...
[04:25:53] <mekwall> its important to note that cached queries will not update themselves if the classes changes afterwards
[04:26:01] <mekwall> so if you have to check everytime, you can use filter
[04:26:14] <lamih> Really nobody for help me ? :(
[04:26:33] <xec> lamih: what was your question?
[04:26:35] <varnie> seemed I didn't read thoroughly what does toggle actually do
[04:26:47] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/gdHEZ/3/
[04:26:55] <varnie> now I figured out:)
[04:26:58] <lamih> If I have understand, if I want several class in a Div, I put a space between ? But Jquery understand that ? http://jsbin.com/ojucas/5/edit#javascript,html,live it's a example, how can make my selector for all class lu_
[04:27:03] <varnie> well, it is my fist day in javascript

[04:31:10] <aaronmcadam> -> 6 OMG sooo useful
[04:31:13] <g0rd0n> i just upgraded my jquery mobile files from 1.0a3 to 1.0b2 to make it work in IE9 (wp7) but for some reason now my pages look small on all handsets... did i miss something?
[04:31:21] <aaronmcadam> yes
[04:31:22] <aaronmcadam> you id
[04:31:23] <aaronmcadam> did
[04:31:28] <aaronmcadam> you forgot the meta tag
[04:31:32] <aaronmcadam> read the blogs when u update
[04:31:32] <lamih> always nobody ? :'(
[04:31:48] <aaronmcadam> that's a big jump, where have u been living g0rd0n
[04:32:07] <g0rd0n> aaronmcadam: heh, that stupid dreamweaver cs 5.5 comes with a3
[04:32:16] <aaronmcadam> eesh
[04:32:26] <aaronmcadam> why the fuck are you using dreamweaver
[04:32:30] <g0rd0n> yeah the guy uses dreamweaver and didnt care
[04:32:33] <g0rd0n> i am just testing it
[04:32:37] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[04:32:40] <g0rd0n> i mean, testing the site
[04:32:44] <aaronmcadam> well you need to add in a meta tag
[04:32:48] <g0rd0n> so i asked the dev why he used that old version
[04:32:58] <aaronmcadam> g0rd0n:     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
[04:33:20] <aaronmcadam> "dev guy" using dreamweaver... lol
[04:34:03] <g0rd0n> aaronmcadam: actually i am the dev, he is the "designer"
[04:34:26] <aaronmcadam> alright
[04:34:58] <g0rd0n> i always use the latest shit when doing my php projects :P
[04:35:36] <lamih> If I have understand, if I want several class in a Div, I put a space between ? But Jquery understand that ? http://jsbin.com/ojucas/5/edit#javascript,html,live it's a example, how can make my selector for all class lu_
[04:35:59] <troubleman> At http://www.asos.com/Women/Beauty/Cat/pgehtml.aspx?cid=1314 when you hover the main image or the "FREE DELIVERY WORLDWIDE" link - what sort of effect is that? Like an easing alpha effect..
[04:36:19] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:36:20] <aaronmcadam> php
[04:36:24] <aaronmcadam> i feel sorry for u :)
[04:36:46] <MoTiOnXml> just to be sure: there's no date/time picker combo widget in jquery ui, right?
[04:36:58] <aaronmcadam> date and time?
[04:37:10] <MoTiOnXml> yea, allows picking date + time in the same dialog
[04:37:14] <aaronmcadam> don't there's a combo, might be something somewhere
[04:37:21] <Myx0x3> im changeing text with .text() is it possible to fade that text? fadeIn or fade dont work..
[04:37:25] <aaronmcadam> ask aj later
[04:37:42] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: the cool one here @ http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-missing-date-time-selector-for-jquery-ui/#idc-cover is not available unfortunately
[04:37:51] <aaronmcadam> why not?
[04:38:14] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: can't download it anywhere, can you? :)
[04:38:16] <varnie> how long it takes to learn jquery on a basic level?
[04:38:18] <aaronmcadam> eww
[04:38:23] <aaronmcadam> that time selector is shit
[04:38:33] <aaronmcadam> i do like addy but that ui is wrong
[04:38:44] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: really? why? looks quite user friendly
[04:38:50] <aaronmcadam> I don't think it is
[04:39:02] <aaronmcadam> sliding to set a specific time
[04:39:16] <MoTiOnXml> would you prefer a drop-down?
[04:39:22] <aaronmcadam> I'm willing to bet sliding the mouse up n down to try and set minutes will be painful
[04:39:36] <aaronmcadam> 2 input boxes tied to - + buttons
[04:39:47] <aaronmcadam> allows u to just type the time
[04:39:53] <aaronmcadam> or inc/decrement
[04:39:57] <MoTiOnXml> well yes
[04:40:02] <aaronmcadam> and its from 2009 anyway
[04:40:07] <aaronmcadam> so that's 50 years old :P
[04:40:19] <MoTiOnXml> more like 50.000
[04:40:23] <aaronmcadam> the link works for me btwe
[04:40:33] <aaronmcadam> it's based on jq 1.3.2
[04:40:45] <aaronmcadam> and ui 1.7.2
[04:40:55] <aaronmcadam> maybe nothin's changed
[04:41:00] <aaronmcadam> :p
[04:41:03] <MoTiOnXml> where did you see the dl link?!
[04:41:07] <MoTiOnXml> am I really that blind?
[04:41:23] <aaronmcadam> "Btw, here’s the download."
[04:41:35] <aaronmcadam> guys in the comments agree with me on the slider
[04:41:36] <MoTiOnXml> omg.
[04:41:42] <MoTiOnXml> i'm really that blind
[04:42:15] <MoTiOnXml> well, one could expand the UI with the input fields in the bottom
[04:42:26] <MoTiOnXml> same here @ http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[04:42:29] <Myx0x3> im changeing text with .text() is it possible to fade that text sexy before it shows?
[04:43:13] <aaronmcadam> nah sliders are the wrong interface
[04:43:31] <aaronmcadam> just try and set a specific time, it's tedious
[04:43:42] <MoTiOnXml> i like the UI actually
[04:43:49] <MoTiOnXml> it's impossible to fuck up in that UI
[04:43:55] <aaronmcadam> "An interesting test of usability is this: pick an odd date/time (say, 10:32pm on July 30, 1967), then see how long it takes to accurately select it using various pickers. "
[04:44:29] <troubleman> At http://www.asos.com/Women/Beauty/Cat/pgehtml.aspx?cid=1314 when you hover the main image or the "FREE DELIVERY WORLDWIDE" link - what sort of effect is that? Like an easing alpha effect..
[04:45:08] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: what about this one then? http://www.ama3.com/anytime/
[04:45:14] <MoTiOnXml> that's even more painful imo
[04:45:35] <mekwall> Myx0x3: fade out the old text and then fade in the new?
[04:45:40] <mekwall> Myx0x3: or what them to crossfade?
[04:45:44] <mekwall> want*
[04:46:01] <aaronmcadam> yeh i didn't look at that one
[04:46:34] <mekwall> jsfiddle down again
[04:46:34] <mekwall> sigh
[04:47:12] <aaronmcadam> MoTiOnXml: why not just use the mask input plugin and let people type it in
[04:47:23] <xec> lamih: did you get help? your selector will search through the entire class string, so you might want to use either something like $('.lu_0, .lu_1') to select each class individually or $('div[class*="lu_"]') which might select more than you want (i.e. any other long class name containing the string)
[04:47:35] <aaronmcadam> people aren't that retarded that they need to use a bad ui to input a time
[04:48:16] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: they asked for a picker UI
[04:48:54] <blackspotwiggins> MoTiOnXml, who is "they"
[04:48:59] <aaronmcadam> the evil powers
[04:49:03] <aaronmcadam> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[04:49:06] <blackspotwiggins> some unseen group of misusability experts?
[04:49:27] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[04:49:30] <MoTiOnXml> the client in question :)
[04:49:32] <MoTiOnXml> who "else" :)
[04:49:43] <blackspotwiggins> nice job
[04:49:43] <xec> lamih: google also found me this; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2178416/jquery-using-starts-with-selector-on-individual-class-names
[04:49:52] <cyb99> hi guys, i have some jquery which populates a list of values, what can i do so that if a user clicks on valueA, it populates value A into an inputbox?
[04:49:52] <blackspotwiggins> the client is telling you how to do your work
[04:50:09] <blackspotwiggins> because they obviously have qualifications and experience in such things
[04:50:21] <MoTiOnXml> the mask plugin looks nice
[04:50:25] <varnie> good bye
[04:50:59] <cyb99> some jquery using ajax to popualte a list even*
[04:51:09] <MoTiOnXml> for time zones etc.
[04:51:13] <MoTiOnXml> which makes sense
[04:51:43] <g0rd0n> aaronmcadam: thank you, that meta thing worked... still having problems like the back button not showing up anymore, but will fix that based on the demos :P
[04:51:55] <jibberJabba> I've had a number of clients asking time pickers (and Ive used http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/)
[04:52:57] <aaronmcadam> g0rd0n: the back button doesn't show up by fefault
[04:53:08] <aaronmcadam> g0rd0n: default* you have to add it in yourself now
[04:53:21] <g0rd0n> bloody dreamweaver
[04:53:27] <aaronmcadam> not dreamweaver
[04:53:31] <uchuff> lol
[04:53:46] <aaronmcadam> it's that your guy is still using alpha software
[04:53:59] <aaronmcadam> tell him to use this link
[04:54:10] <vladyn> what mouse event radio buttons have guys ?
[04:54:13] <vladyn> checked?
[04:54:19] <g0rd0n> aaronmcadam: dreamweaver actually provides those files if you create a jquery mobile project, it has some kind of integrated support apparently
[04:54:39] <aaronmcadam> g0rd0n:  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js"></script>
[04:54:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah but he can edit a html page right
[04:55:01] <g0rd0n> of course :)
[04:55:05] <aaronmcadam> and this g0rd0n <link href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
[04:55:14] <aaronmcadam> and then before u release, use the stable
[04:55:26] <aaronmcadam> and it'll probably be 1.0 before you release anyway
[04:55:43] <aaronmcadam> that way you don't have to go lookin for bugs that have been fixed already g0rd0n
[04:56:04] <g0rd0n> aaronmcadam: ook!
[04:56:09] <aaronmcadam> belive me
[04:56:16] <aaronmcadam> that's why I'm using latest
[04:58:16] <troubleman> At http://www.asos.com/Women/Beauty/Cat/pgehtml.aspx?cid=1314 when you hover the main image or the "FREE DELIVERY WORLDWIDE" link - what sort of effect is that? Like an easing alpha effect..
[04:58:31] <troubleman> * eased alpha
[05:00:16] <anli_> Is there a fast way of seeing if a function is defined twice in a js file?
[05:01:08] <troubleman> JSFIDDLE IS BACK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[05:10:28] <mekwall> Myx0x3: since jsfiddle is down I used testcake... http://testcake.net/udb3w
[05:11:03] <mekwall> Myx0x3: if that was what you were looking for that is
[05:14:10] <zabka> sorry for beeing stupid. but i have an ajax call and wanna have a general success function. what is the best place, where i could put this function? document.ready?
[05:14:41] <blackspotwiggins> zabka, if you want something to run when any ajax is successful, you can bind to "ajaxSuccess"
[05:15:07] <mekwall> zabka: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4898381/jquery-how-to-fire-certain-action-before-and-after-every-ajax-call/4898418#4898418
[05:15:34] <zabka> it should be general function(called by some others functions)
[05:16:15] <mekwall> zabka: my answer should hold the solution :)
[05:16:55] <zabka> mekwall: oh , sorry, i just noticed this link. let me see
[05:16:55] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: ajaxSuccess is pretty outdated since 1.5 ;)
[05:17:12] <blackspotwiggins> it's still useful
[05:17:27] <zabka> thanks mekwall blackspotwiggins
[05:17:52] <blackspotwiggins> you don't have to know that part is actually initiating ajax
[05:17:56] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: sure, but I prefer using deferreds or prefilters
[05:18:07] <blackspotwiggins> you could just set that on any ajax, for example a spinner shows up
[05:18:27] <blackspotwiggins> IMO ajax events are more valid in that case than adding prefilter/deferred to every request
[05:18:48] <mekwall> huh?
[05:19:14] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: check the prefilter example. it's added to all ajax requests
[05:19:33] <mekwall> ?ajaxPrefilter
[05:19:34] <bot-t1> mekwall, jQuery.ajaxPrefilter() - Handle custom Ajax options or modify existing options before each request is sent and before they are processed by $.ajax(). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[05:19:46] <blackspotwiggins> yes, and that's what i said
[05:19:58] <blackspotwiggins> IMO listening to events > adding shit to every request
[05:20:52] <mekwall> I guess I'm too thick to get what you mean blackspot :D
[05:25:23] <zabka> why is the notation var toggleButton = function() {} and not function toggleButton() { return res;} ?
[05:26:37] <Jon47> zabka, both are valid, but the first one is more explicit about scoping
[05:30:36] <blackspotwiggins> Jon47, zabka they should be the same actually
[05:31:30] <zabka> ok, thanks Jon47 blackspotwiggins
[05:31:56] <mekwall> hehe, they are not really the same
[05:33:02] <shellox_> hey, it's possible to select all elements from this enumeration in a xml file: https://gist.github.com/2b00fd9c3cfe9453f317 and put the value of each in a selectbox?
[05:33:54] <mekwall> Jon47: you are wrong about the scoping...
[05:34:11] <mekwall> A good resource is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859
[05:34:27] <mekwall> there are many differences
[05:34:50] <Jon47> mekwall thanks, looking forward to learning more
[05:34:51] <blackspotwiggins> ah, the hoisting bit
[05:35:44] <Jon47> but i never said they were scoped differently, I just said meant that one seems more clear to me about its scoping
[05:36:20] <mekwall> Jon47: oh so it seems more clear to you? :)
[05:36:39] <mekwall> Jon47: well there's no difference in the scoping at all
[05:36:45] <Jon47> the "var" makes it stand out to me, it's a syntax highlighted keyword
[05:36:47] <mekwall> you can even combine them (as seen in the second answer)
[05:36:49] <Jon47> but maybe that's just me
[05:36:55] <mekwall> var foo = function bar() {};
[05:40:41] <maxw> I have a 'visibility: hidden' in my css file, and .toggle() from my js doesn't seem to toggle it. If I comment out the line in css, then it works as expected (I have a function bound to a button click to toggle it). Any clues?
[05:42:42] <mekwall> Jon47: perhaps you are referring to this: var namespace = {}; namespace.foo = function() {};
[05:43:46] <Jon47> mekwall I was just thinking about situations where there might be a global function defined with the same name, and then that same function name defined within another function or object literal or something
[05:43:49] <troubleman> At http://www.asos.com/Women/Beauty/Cat/pgehtml.aspx?cid=1314 when you hover the main image or the "FREE DELIVERY WORLDWIDE" link - what sort of effect is that?
[05:44:03] <Jon47> but regardless, the salient point is the article you linked, so thanks for that, i'm reading it now and learning a lot
[05:44:52] <mekwall> Jon47: alright :) no problem
[05:45:36] <donCams> troubleman, animate opacity
[05:46:12] <troubleman> awesome..
[05:46:27] <donCams> $('.GBfade').animate({opacity: .5}, 'slow
[05:46:45] <donCams> ');
[05:47:10] <mekwall> why oh why did they animate the background? *pulls hair*
[05:47:30] <mekwall> overdoing it :(
[05:47:55] <maxw> maxw@freenode: does anyone know why me setting visibility in css stops me from being able to toggle the visiblity in js? I'm using $('#names').find('.ui-scrollbar').toggle() - but that only works without the 'visibility: hidden' in css.
[05:48:12] <donCams> yeah. ugly stuff
[05:48:15] <Lochlan> js uses display:none;
[05:48:27] <fakingfantastic> what is the best plugin for doing hash change navigation?
[05:48:51] <mekwall> could be bbq
[05:48:55] <mekwall> by almighty cowboy
[05:49:11] <mekwall> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq
[05:49:13] <maxw> Lochlan: was that for me?
[05:49:25] <mekwall> ^--- fakingfantastic
[05:50:02] <fakingfantastic> k, that's what I've been using, just havent seen it updated in a while - didn't know if that was due to stability or if there was a new hotness
[05:50:15] <mekwall> maxw: is visibility set to a css class or inline style?
[05:50:43] <mekwall> maxw: because if that element has that class, it will always have that visibility (unless you override it with !important, but that's a very bad practice)
[05:51:13] <Lochlan> inline, mekwall
[05:51:29] <maxw> mekwall: it is '#names .ui-scrollbar' - so I guess that applies
[05:51:40] <Lochlan> yea maxw what i said earlier..
[05:52:10] <mekwall> maxw: yes, then it is in a class... so then you need to remove that class or remove visibility from that class and put it inline or in a separate class
[05:52:41] <maxw> Lochlan: I thought display: none was different to visibility: hidden...
[05:52:52] <mekwall> maxw: rule of thumb, when changing css with .css, you are messing with inline styles, so removing or otherwise manipulating styles that are in a class is counter-productive
[05:53:26] <mekwall> maxw: it is very different yes
[05:53:42] <mekwall> maxw: but you'll still run into the same problem
[05:54:31] <maxw> ok, thanks ... mekwall - I still want it to take the same space, so it is 'visibility' I want, iinm; but looks like I can't quite do what I thought...no big problem though. thanks, y'all
[05:54:31] <mekwall> you can have a css class that's named hidden and have visibility: hidden in there... toggling that class should give you the desired effect
[05:54:45] <safzouf> Help Guys!
[05:54:48] <maxw> mekwall: oh? interesting :)
[05:54:52] <safzouf> jCarousel Lite
[05:55:03] <safzouf> it has a problem if there are 1 element in the list :(
[05:55:07] <mekwall> maxw: well it's either that or put it inline :)
[05:55:11] <safzouf> it does print nothing
[05:55:14] <mekwall> maxw: putting it inline takes more bytes though
[05:55:26] <safzouf> can someone help please?
[05:55:44] <maxw> mekwall: I like to keep the css in one place...it's only a demo and I'm discovering what I can do and can't.
[05:55:47] <mekwall> safzouf: calm down or everyone will die
[05:55:55] <safzouf> :)
[05:55:57] <safzouf> ok
[05:56:14] <safzouf> It its about jCarousel Lite
[05:56:21] <donCams> safzouf, go directly to jQuery-ER. our nurses and doctors will tend to your situation
[05:56:21] <safzouf> the jquery library
[05:56:27] <safzouf> :D
[05:56:36] <mekwall> maxw: well .css is for manipulating inline styles, and should not be used to override styles that are set in css
[05:56:45] <safzouf> that was funny
[05:57:00] <safzouf> so,
[05:57:09] <safzouf> who faced the same issue in jCarousel Lite
[05:57:11] <safzouf> ?
[05:57:22] <mekwall> safzouf: contact the author
[05:57:28] <safzouf> emm
[05:57:59] <dr0id> anyone used ckeditor ?
[05:58:22] <dr0id> I have some encoding issues, utf8 chars not displaying well, what could be the reason ? the utf8 chars display well on html pages though!
[05:58:25] <mekwall> safzouf: or take a look at my plugin that I wrote just to replace jCarousel Lite - http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/wN4Zy/
[05:59:16] <safzouf> seems good
[05:59:28] <safzouf> is the use as jcarousel lite?
[05:59:30] <safzouf> same?
[05:59:36] <mekwall> safzouf: look at the code?
[05:59:45] <mekwall> safzouf: it's all in there
[05:59:53] <safzouf> yess
[05:59:56] <safzouf> seems the same
[06:00:36] <safzouf> ok I'll try it
[06:00:53] <shellox_> hey i try to read this xml file https://gist.github.com/2b00fd9c3cfe9453f317 with this code: https://gist.github.com/f2740abe30c164cd3c24
[06:01:18] <safzouf> where is the download link mekawall?
[06:01:20] <shellox_> I want to read out the value of each item in the enumeration and append it to a selectbox
[06:02:37] <ablomen> ugh coffeescript, anyway, shellox_ i think you want  "<option>" + value + "</option>", if coffeescript does not do this for you
[06:02:45] <shellox_> I have a syntax error in the code? It doesnt add the items to the select box and I have no idea why. The chromium ressource tracking shows the xml file as available
[06:03:24] <ablomen> oh and you want to either make it a jquery object, or put everything in a string first and then .html it to the option element
[06:03:52] <shellox_> ablomen: oh, i fixed it to "<option>" + value + "</option>",
[06:03:55] <ablomen> (second option is better)
[06:04:32] <shellox_> ablomen: the data are stored in the xml file, i want to read out it there
[06:05:16] <mekwall> safzouf: there's no download. just copy the plugin code :P
[06:05:18] <shellox_> I haven't done this before and try now for 2 hours to get it working :P
[06:05:29] <safzouf> ah ok
[06:05:37] <safzouf> this use Jquery library
[06:05:39] <mekwall> safzouf: I merely threw that together in a day to replace the darn jCarousel Lite I was using hehe
[06:05:41] <safzouf> only
[06:05:44] <mekwall> safzouf: yes
[06:05:47] <safzouf> :)
[06:05:48] <safzouf> I see
[06:06:01] <ablomen> shellox_, https://gist.github.com/94585c4080147ac74b45 << somehting like this
[06:06:04] <safzouf> I hope I will integrate it correctly in myu site
[06:06:21] <ablomen> (but without the syntax error in line 11)
[06:07:12] <mekwall> BRACE FOR IMPACT!
[06:07:21] <KarateKip3> brace for impact!!!
[06:07:22] <opius> omg ^^
[06:08:08] <dr0id> ANYONE USES CKEDITOR ?
[06:10:27] <aaronmcadam> hey guys
[06:10:34] <dr0id> hey
[06:10:38] <aaronmcadam> stupid question
[06:10:39] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[06:10:52] <dr0id> 8k people have been net splitted
[06:10:57] <dr0id> aaronmcadam: I have some encoding issues, utf8 chars not displaying well, what could be the reason ? the utf8 chars display well on html pages though!
[06:11:01] <dr0id> with ckeditor
[06:11:08] <aaronmcadam> ooh
[06:11:14] <aaronmcadam> ckeditor is complete utf-8 tho
[06:12:06] <aaronmcadam> i want to take an opts obj literal and turn it to an array
[06:13:41] <mekwall> dr0id: duuude.... ckeditor isn't even jquery related :P
[06:13:46] <aaronmcadam> hah
[06:13:49] <dr0id> doesn't matters
[06:13:52] <aaronmcadam> it's a good project tho
[06:14:07] <aaronmcadam> #jquery shouldn't be just jquery specific :)
[06:14:09] <mekwall> dr0id: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/SQK8n/
[06:14:10] <mekwall> :D
[06:14:20] <mekwall> you can help me continue on that one
[06:14:56] <dr0id> Heh, nice one
[06:15:07] <shellox_> ablomen: thanks first
[06:15:22] <mekwall> dr0id: and old :)
[06:15:31] <shellox_> dr0id: hi, i see you are also in #sinatra ;)
[06:15:38] <dr0id> yeah :)
[06:15:42] <mekwall> dr0id: I've more or less moved away from wysiwyg editors in favor for markdown editors
[06:15:52] <mekwall> which makes more sense
[06:15:58] <mekwall> http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/
[06:16:01] <dr0id> wysiwyg can't be replaced entirely yet
[06:16:06] <dr0id> markdown is good, but still
[06:16:16] <mekwall> depends on what you are doing
[06:16:17] <aaronmcadam> underscore fuckin rules :D
[06:16:20] <shellox_> ablomen: but the selectbox is now empty
[06:16:29] <shellox_> dr0id: i prefer textile :)
[06:16:29] <mekwall> dr0id: what kind of editing are you doing?
[06:16:33] <aaronmcadam> _.toArray( { 1 : 1, 2 : 3 } ) -> [1, 3]
[06:16:39] <dr0id> html
[06:16:41] <KarateKip3> wow... Freenode looks sooo much better after The Upgrade... ;)
[06:16:45] <mekwall> markItUp has support for textile as well :P
[06:16:53] <dr0id> with images, etc. its like a cms
[06:16:58] <mekwall> KarateKip3: dude!!!! :(
[06:17:01] <mekwall> I am still on the old version
[06:17:03] <aaronmcadam> what upgrade?
[06:17:07] <mekwall> give me new Freenode now!
[06:17:18] <shellox_> i write my blog posts with textile or markdown
[06:17:22] <aaronmcadam> am i missing something?
[06:17:27] <shellox_> and render theme with jekyll :P
[06:17:31] <shellox_> them*
[06:17:40] <dr0id> I see
[06:17:44] <mekwall> I'm going to convert my wordpress blog to node.js, jade and markdown :P
[06:17:55] <mekwall> and express I guess
[06:18:26] <aaronmcadam> guys how do u upgrade?
[06:18:28] <mekwall> shellox_: you use jekyll on github? :D
[06:18:30] <KarateKip3> aaronmcadam: freenode is having upgrade/big maintenance job. Servers are disconnected 1 by 1 these days. Kornbluth was just dc
[06:18:41] <dr0id> we got auto upgraded aroon
[06:18:44] <aaronmcadam> kornbluth?
[06:18:45] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: haha, we're just trolling :P
[06:18:46] <dr0id> because we are simply special
[06:18:53] <dr0id> 8k people got net splitted
[06:19:00] <dr0id> anyway, help me out :(
[06:19:03] <mekwall> aaronmcadam: what KarateKip3 said... it's a serverside upgrade and we won't be noticing anything ;)
[06:19:13] <KarateKip3> aaronmcadam: kornbluth is the server i am connected to from the freenode network.
[06:19:13] <aaronmcadam> I want a new skin for xchat then heh
[06:19:14] <dr0id> mekwall: yer the one who wrote that white php fw ?
[06:19:34] <mekwall> dr0id: milk? :) yes
[06:19:48] <mekwall> wrote and wrote... it's far from finished
[06:19:52] <shellox_> mekwall: nop, on my own server
[06:19:54] <dr0id> yeah, that
[06:20:01] <KarateKip3> aaronmcadam: don't worry, your server will be upgraded soon and you will get your dc  ;)
[06:20:18] <mekwall> dr0id: I'm that same mekwall yes :)
[06:20:21] <aaronmcadam> noooo not my freenodes :(
[06:20:37] <shellox_> mekwall: i write posts with textile, push with git, a git receive-hook start a shell script, render it and store the output in a dir of the webserver
[06:20:52] <mekwall> shellox_: good stuff :)
[06:21:02] <shellox_> mekwall: static stuff :P
[06:21:11] <mekwall> shellox_: there's a similar lib for node.js
[06:21:13] <shellox_> ah, and comments are powered by disqus
[06:21:19] <mekwall> http://howtonode.org/ <--- uses it
[06:21:30] * mekwall is not ruby fan
[06:21:33] <shellox_> mekwall: ok, but im more the ruby guy ;)
[06:21:54] * dr0id is not a python fan
[06:21:55] <mekwall> shellox_: got nothing against ruby... I just didn't jump on the bandwagon :)
[06:22:09] <shellox_> dr0id: me neither
[06:22:20] <mekwall> shellox_: got stuck with php, and then I played around with some python... and now I'm all into Node.js baby ;)
[06:23:04] <shellox_> the good think with js is that you can build client and server side applications now
[06:23:04] <JAAulde> Is it possible to keep .importNode() and .adoptNode() from changing the case on tag names?
[06:23:11] <JAAulde> (DOM methods, not jQ)
[06:23:33] <mekwall> JAAulde: what?!
[06:24:25] <JAAulde> mekwall: importNode() and adoptNode(), the DOM methods, change the case of tag names. If I have an element named childOne in a document, and import it into a second document, it becomes childone in that second deoc
[06:24:41] <danima> i have 5 divs with ids like box_1 box_2  etc.. I am trying to figure out how to hide, on click, all the divs after the one clicked on , any suggestions? Ive started with $('[id*=box_]').click(function(){  })
[06:25:55] <mekwall> JAAulde: it's because HTML is case-insensitive'
[06:26:18] <mekwall> JAAulde: you'd have to run it through the XML parser (meaning you need to change the doctype or whatever)
[06:26:25] <JAAulde> mekwall: 1) if it's case insensitive, then why does it bother changing it? 2) I am working with XML documents in JS
[06:26:53] <JAAulde> and by if, I mean I know it is case sensitive, but why the heck does it bother then?
[06:26:53] <mekwall> JAAulde: no idea, might be that it works with lowercase only internally
[06:26:59] <mekwall> not preserving the case
[06:27:00] <JAAulde> what a PITA
[06:27:07] <mekwall> JAAulde: agreed :)
[06:27:40] <mekwall> JAAulde: try switching to xhtml doctype
[06:27:46] <mekwall> JAAulde: xhtml is case-sensitive :P
[06:28:06] <Paveloosha> Hi guys.. I made a function which returns HTML code of special carecters.. problem is when I am passing a special carecter as parameter it is showing a block if I alert it.. any idea!
[06:28:06] <JAAulde> mekwall: again, I am not working with HTML. I *am* in the browser, but I am maniulating an XML document
[06:28:46] <mekwall> JAAulde: yes but the document you are manipulating the xml can't be xml, right? :)
[06:29:00] <Paveloosha> it is happening on server side only..
[06:29:27] <mekwall> JAAulde: you are in a html document, running some scripts that manipulate xml - right?
[06:29:42] <JAAulde> mekwall: yes
[06:30:03] <mekwall> JAAulde: so when you use the DOM methods it will follow HTML rules, which means case-insensitive :)
[06:30:10] <danima> anyone have any suggestions for me?
[06:30:26] <JAAulde> if the browser is going ot provide APIs for generating and working with DOM of any kind, it shouldn't use the context of one on the other
[06:30:29] <mekwall> JAAulde: switching to XHTML for that docuement however, should make it case-sensivite
[06:30:32] <mekwall> sensitive*
[06:31:46] <JAAulde> mekwall: no go--switcxhing to XHTML makes no diff
[06:31:59] <mekwall> JAAulde: how about https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLSerializer  ?
[06:32:39] <JAAulde> oh well, will have to stick with straight DOM methods on this function, and create the elements directly in the specific DOM
[06:32:52] <JAAulde> mekwall: yes, am using it
[06:32:58] <mekwall> JAAulde: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Parsing_and_serializing_XML <-- another good article
[06:34:29] <mekwall> Paveloosha: encoding issues? :)
[06:35:03] <mekwall> utfuckeight
[06:35:57] <Marcofe> hi guys
[06:38:13] <duttons> hi could someone have a quick look at this http://chicfreakz.co.uk/table.html and tell me why when it does a sort it is showing the old table underneath.. ?
[06:38:28] <duttons> am I missing something in the css or is it to do with the script?
[06:39:28] <JAAulde> Ok, so back to the jQuery issue that led me to the importNode() question, is it possible to have jQuery create an element in a document context other than window.document?
[06:39:50] <JAAulde> or is jQuery chained to window.document as a browser lib
[06:40:21] <shellox_> I still haven't solved it, it just write nothing in the console
[06:40:23] <shellox_> 15:01 < shellox_> hey i try to read this xml file https://gist.github.com/2b00fd9c3cfe9453f317 with  this code: https://gist.github.com/f2740abe30c164cd3c24
[06:40:28] <hariom> I am using window.location.replace to redirect my ajax page to the login page if login check fails for any of the pages on the site. How to give relative url in window.location.replace ?
[06:41:23] <shellox_> jonatasnona: .gov.br?
[06:41:39] <metadan> has anyone had any trouble with .prev() and .siblings() in ie9 using jquery 1.6.1
[06:41:45] <metadan> neither seem to work
[06:42:04] <shellox_> metadan: you demotivate me, i have to work with ie7 here :P
[06:42:52] <metadan> i have that to come later on
[06:42:55] <metadan> :9
[06:43:03] <metadan> just started the xbrowsering
[06:43:40] <metadan> you still supporting ie6 ooi?
[06:44:30] <Jon47> metadan it is possible that you are nesting flow content type elements inside elements that should not contain them, like labels or p tags?  some browsers will automatically move these elements around for you which can make the results of traversal methods seem incorrect
[06:44:55] <metadan> nah it's 2 inputs in a form, nice speculation though
[06:45:40] <metadan> one is a submit button, one's a hidden
[06:45:58] <metadan> just trying to get the value of the hidden on click of the submit
[06:46:03] <Yaazkal> Hello everybody. I'm trying to make this (Example two) http://css-tricks.com/examples/MagicLine/ on this under construction site: http://www.orbiware.com/grafiflex.com/productos     the code is the same and I can't find why is not working propertly the color changing. Can somebody find the issue?
[06:46:35] <metadan> $(this).prev().val() doesn't work neither does $(this),siblings('.relevantClass').val()
[06:46:41] <metadan> or anything else I can find
[06:46:48] <metadan> fine in chrome/ff as ever
[06:48:21] <mekwall> NO U
[06:48:45] <dr0id> I am still stuck with my ckeditor issue
[06:48:47] <Jon47> metadan i think it's time for a fiddle
[06:48:48] <mekwall> metadan: this is your brain?
[06:49:26] * mekwall just watched tourettes karaoke which inspired his aggressiveness
[06:50:00] <mekwall> yay
[06:50:13] <mekwall> christel must be hawt
[06:50:17] <metadan> aye i'm buggering around now
[06:50:24] <metadan> always worth a quick ask though when it comes to fighting ie bugs
[06:50:31] <metadan> might save yourself a day or two
[06:50:35] <metadan> for a character
[06:50:41] <metadan> I hate IE
[06:50:43] <metadan> :(
[06:51:07] <mekwall> metadan: and I'm sure that IE hates you back
[06:51:21] <mekwall> metadan: at least you have the hate in common :)
[06:52:04] <metadan> mekwall: now I feel dirty
[06:52:07] <metadan> thanks :p
[06:52:17] <mekwall> I actually married IE, 6 years ago, but I've been screwing around with both Firefox and Chrome since then...
[06:52:51] <booboonathan_> IE hates everything and everyone
[06:52:57] <booboonathan_> and the feelings are mutual
[06:54:02] <mekwall> I remember when IE6 first came... it was uber fast
[06:54:13] <mekwall> and no other browser could touch it
[06:55:05] <booboonathan_> haha yeah true
[06:55:07] <booboonathan_> bad days
[06:55:18] <booboonathan_> but can anyone help me with a slight positioning issue with animate();?
[06:55:36] <booboonathan_> i think its a simple fix, i just can't get my head round it
[06:55:48] <danieliser> any plugin devs on?
[06:56:23] <iateadonut> after a function is done executing, how can i make it repeat itself?
[06:56:51] <albertosheinfeld> anyone using jquery mobile here??? i have a simple question
[06:56:55] <Jon47> recursion..
[06:57:00] <Jon47> or iteration using setInterval
[06:57:04] <iateadonut> i have it executing itself at the end, but it does not wait ...
[06:57:05] <iateadonut> ok.
[06:57:06] <iateadonut> thanks.
[06:57:16] <booboonathan_> http://jsfiddle.net/6Xptk/ - if you hover over them all, they look and work fine, but if you hover over the 2nd time it fucks up slightly
[06:57:19] <mekwall> Jon47: setInterval is a big no :p
[06:57:21] <danieliser> iateadonut: try var foo = function(){ foo(); }
[06:57:21] <booboonathan_> any one know why?
[06:57:35] <mekwall> Jon47: unless you actually need to time it
[06:57:51] <mekwall> that's the only time you should use setInterval
[06:58:24] <Jon47> yeah you're right, that'd be nuts, if one execution got hung up and took too long, you could have multiple instances of the function running at once
[06:58:49] <mekwall> danieliser: plugin dev here. why?
[06:59:07] <mekwall> Jon47: indeed :D
[06:59:25] <mekwall> Jon47: one of the noob mistakes that some people do when polling servers ;)
[07:00:56] <iateadonut> well, it runs an animation in 6000 seconds.
[07:00:58] <Sanden> Internet Explorer refuses to persist the cookie in this toggle, although no problems in other browsers. And what's the preferred browser of choice in Peoplesoft? Guess. http://jsfiddle.net/sanden/7YTXV/
[07:01:04] <iateadonut> and it needs to run it again after it is finished.
[07:01:17] <Jon47> six thousand seconds!
[07:01:20] <iateadonut> so the correct way to do that is...?
[07:01:23] <iateadonut> 6000 ms
[07:01:29] <Jon47> aaah
[07:01:30] <danieliser> working on an web app that will rely heavily on jquery. i have a few questions about how to best design the plugins for my framework
[07:01:44] <mekwall> IT'S OVER 1000!
[07:02:08] <Nomikos> Can data values in HTML elements not have mixed case keys? <form data-itemName='foo'> does not work for me
[07:02:43] <Jon47> iateadonut I guess just put a call to the original function at the bottom of the animation callback function
[07:02:47] <Jon47> do you want it to repeat endlessly?
[07:03:06] <mekwall> danieliser: bad timing. it's 4pm coffee break :D
[07:03:32] <mekwall> Nomikos: HTML is case in-sensitive
[07:03:51] <mekwall> Nomikos: use dash as separator
[07:03:52] <iateadonut> yes, endlessly.
[07:03:54] <iateadonut> ok.  thanks.
[07:04:06] <iateadonut> i was just putting it at the end of the function, which didn't work at all.
[07:04:18] <Nomikos> mekwall: but why would it fail to work?
[07:04:31] <Nomikos> lowercase itemname works, itemName doesn't
[07:04:37] <metadan> This is balls
[07:04:44] <danieliser> mekwall: lol 10am here
[07:04:56] <mekwall> Nomikos: not sure why, but camelcasing in html is a bad idea anyways ;)
[07:04:59] <metadan> Could it be to do with .live
[07:05:05] <mekwall> so you shouldn't waste time on that
[07:05:30] <Nomikos> first using the minus was bad, then the underscore, now camelcasing :-p
[07:05:50] <metadan> I have a .live which binds click events to a button. onclick stops the form submit from the button and posts elsewhere
[07:05:56] <Jon47> metadan a fiddle will tell the channel everything we need to know to be able to help you, and in the process of creating one you might just distill your problem down to the point where you figure it out yourself
[07:06:12] <metadan> I'm fiddling
[07:06:14] <metadan> and debugging
[07:06:29] <metadan> you mean as in fiddler?
[07:06:35] <Jon47> hehe
[07:06:37] <Nomikos> mekwall: it works for jQuery 1.4 and 1.5, not the latest
[07:06:46] <Jon47> metadan, i mean, make a paste of your code that we can read
[07:06:59] <Jon47> such as here http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:07:08] <ajpiano> Nomikos: jquery automatically converts data-foo-bar to fooBar inside of the cache
[07:07:26] <Nomikos> ajpiano: and if you start out with fooBar?
[07:07:44] <ajpiano> it should leave it alone,
[07:07:56] <ajpiano> if you're having bugs with camelcase data stuff, please test against the *edge* jquery on jsfiddle
[07:07:59] <metadan>     $('.addToBtn').live('click', function(e) {          e.preventDefault(); /* some stuff */         $.post( env + '/ui/show/book/',              {'asin': $(this).attr('id')},             function(data, success) {                 /* some other stuff */             }         );     });
[07:07:59] <ajpiano> and see if it's still broken
[07:08:03] <metadan> acting on
[07:08:19] <Nomikos> ajpiano: I'll try that
[07:08:37] <metadan> <form name="addBookToDiscussion" method="post" class="jsHide" id="addBookToDiscussion">         <input type="hidden" value="B0054EX89W" name="asin" class="asin" style="display: none; ">         <input type="submit" id="B0054EX89W" class="addTo plusBtn" value="Add to DISCUSSION" style="display: none; ">      </form>
[07:08:52] <metadan> Ah got it :)
[07:09:01] <metadan> Cheerrs Jon47
[07:09:12] <metadan> gotta love those bounceback moments
[07:09:36] <Jon47> hehe, nice
[07:10:31] <Nomikos> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/JxFtn/
[07:12:10] <Nomikos> Far as I can see, it started not working at 1.6?
[07:13:37] <booboonathan_> Can anyone help me with animate() please? hopefully it will take an experienced mind 2 minutes xD
[07:14:16] <booboonathan_> http://jsfiddle.net/6Xptk/
[07:14:28] <ajpiano> Nomikos: seems like intended behaviour that we were getting wrong before 1.6
[07:14:28] <booboonathan_> if you have over once, it works fine, hover over a second time and it pushes the text down
[07:14:31] <booboonathan_> it's really annoying
[07:14:39] <ajpiano> Nomikos: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7328#comment:4
[07:16:24] <iateadonut> that worked, using the callback function.
[07:16:46] <iateadonut> the thing is i've got 4 animations going at the same time - and i put then all into 'runAll()' function
[07:17:02] <iateadonut> but it's only one of those animations that callback runAll() - this works.
[07:17:07] <iateadonut> but is it the right way to do it?
[07:17:19] <iateadonut> or should i set up runAll() to have a callback function?
[07:17:27] <iateadonut> (and if so, how do i do that?)
[07:17:48] <Nomikos> ajpiano: ok, that makes sense. Am I nitpicking if I point out that data-Foobar with data('Foobar') does still work in edge? :-)
[07:18:05] <aaronmcadam> mekwall: you have to test analytics on a dev site right, not locally?
[07:18:17] <Nomikos> I don't know the rules for this kind of thing, though
[07:19:06] <ajpiano> hmm, i'm not sure, let me check
[07:22:29] <g0rd0n> is there an easy way with jquery to request a web page via ajax and insert it into a div?
[07:22:53] <dr0id> jquery is the only lib that provides an easy way t do that
[07:22:56] <g0rd0n> duh i guess i can do that with .post :P
[07:22:58] <booboonathan_> how do you do position in animate?
[07:23:07] <booboonathan_> and does animate change the position property?
[07:23:39] <aaronmcadam> magic booboonathan_
[07:23:44] <kborchers> g0rd0n: you could also see ?load
[07:23:44] <bot-t1> g0rd0n, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:23:53] <kborchers> hmmm

[07:24:21] <booboonathan_> nice one aaronmcadam
[07:24:41] <g0rd0n> uh, nice, thanks kborchers
[07:24:51] <duttons> hi could someone have a quick look at this http://chicfreakz.co.uk/table.html and tell me why when it does a sort it is showing the old table underneath.. ?
[07:24:53] <duttons> am I missing something in the css or is it to do with the script?
[07:24:57] <g0rd0n> kicks ass :D
[07:26:34] <aaronmcadam> no problem
[07:30:14] <oliau> hi
[07:30:26] <dr0id> aaronmcadam: I am still stuck
[07:35:24] <iateadonut> if i have a function that i want to apply as a mouseover to TWO div's, how do i do that?
[07:35:39] <Nomikos> ajpiano: anyway, I'll stick to lowercase data attributes (per spec), thanks for the pointer
[07:35:55] <ajpiano> yah, we're sussing this out in -dev right now Nomikos
[07:35:55] <iateadonut> the what i have now is:
[07:35:55] <iateadonut> $("#button_text").mouseout( function() { blah;	});
[07:36:02] <ajpiano> cause we've had a lot of edge stuff around this
[07:36:09] <iateadonut> what i would like to do is add another div to that.
[07:36:26] <Nomikos> ajpiano: ok, good luck :)
[07:36:57] <aaronmcadam> yeah I see
[07:37:07] <iateadonut> something like $("#button_text")AND$("#animation_button").mouseout( function() { blah;	});
[07:39:29] <iateadonut> and is there a way to STOP all animations and return the elements to their original positions?
[07:42:22] <kborchers> ?stop @ iateadonut
[07:42:22] <bot-t1> iateadonut, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[07:42:25] <consumerism> i have $(sel).sortable(); but i also want to apply this to elements that are created dynamically matched by sel. how can i do this?
[07:43:02] <kborchers> ?live @ consumerism
[07:43:02] <bot-t1> consumerism, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:43:14] <kborchers> hmmm, but on create that won't work
[07:43:31] <kborchers> why not just do .sortable() on them as you create them?
[07:43:39] <consumerism> kborchers: hm i could i suppose
[07:44:43] <booboonathan_> would really really appreciate it if anyone could lend a helping hand
[07:45:04] <booboonathan_> http://jsfiddle.net/6Xptk/ <-- if you hover over once then it works great, hover over a 2nd time and the formatting messes up
[07:45:07] <booboonathan_> but can't figure out why
[07:46:48] <webguynow> Does anyone have experience with table sorting functionality ?   I'm curious if you can use a short date format mm/dd/yy and still have sorting capability on it - by designating it as a date, perhaps - any ideas ?
[07:47:14] <webguynow> I've seen DataTables, sortable and a few jQuery plugins
[07:47:35] <iateadonut> i tried to run $(':animated').stop(true,true); at the beginning of a repeating function that animates four elements on the screen, but it says, 'too much recursion'.
[07:47:35] <iateadonut> it is an attempt to fix an error where the animations are all at different points in their animation state when the browser back button is pushed.
[07:47:45] <webguynow> so far ust taken a 'light' look at these.
[07:48:06] <djQuery> webguynow: there are plenty of table plugins that do that
[07:48:16] <djQuery> webguynow: see ?jqgrid

[08:39:44] <janthony> var visualEditor = $('.wp-editor', $('#content_ifr')[0].contentDocument); - Any idea why this doesn't work in IE7? It works in IE8, IE9, FF, Chrome, Safari. It's a selector for the content of an iFrame on the DOM.
[08:41:13] <ngharo> tiofred: http://jsfiddle.net/9AKna/5/ this work?
[08:42:27] <tiofred> ngharo: thanks, I check it now

[08:52:08] <tiofred> ngharo: err, I can see Tux before even hover
[08:52:52] <ngharo> tiofred: that's because their transparent gifs.  crappy images for this effect
[08:53:00] <ngharo> theyre*
[08:53:17] <tiofred> I got that, but I have to deal with transparent pngs too...
[08:54:00] <tiofred> and because the background of the page is not plain colored, I can't put something as div background either
[08:54:04] <tiofred> arrggghhhhhh
[08:54:22] <ngharo> you sir are fucked.  lol
[08:54:34] <tiofred> ngharo: you are so right

[08:54:58] <ngharo> tiofred: surely your images are the same design?
[08:55:07] <ngharo> this is for a button perhaps?
[08:55:29] <ngharo> tiofred: edit the fiddle so it's using your images and lets play around with it
[08:55:35] <tiofred> ngharo: yes, the above one is a letter (a big letter), the below one a the same letter with a flame effect around
[08:55:49] <tiofred> ngharo: let me try ok

[09:01:30] <dvgsvc> thanks kborchers
[09:02:14] <dvgsvc> i currently have a .change, which accounts only when the user changes a value from a dropdown list. how can i have it operate on load of the page as well?

[09:04:43] <ngharo> cool, looks good then eh?
[09:04:46] <tiofred> ngharo: is there a way to make this code "generic" ? like I have three times a div like that on the page
[09:04:51] <tiofred> yea, looks perfect!!!!
[09:06:11] <tiofred> ngharo:  like img_a is "this", and img_b is "this" - ".png"+ "under.png" or something like that
[09:06:31] <dvgsvc> i used .bind('click change',function(){ but hm, it won't work as i want it. basically i want it to function when i push the back button
[09:06:59] <SEJeff_work> What is the best way to setup an error callback for a $.post when it receives a 401 for a user session that isn't logged in?
[09:08:53] <SEJeff_work> Is the only advice to use the long-form $.ajax with the error callbacks or is there a shortcut that works with $.post?
[09:10:32] <ngharo> tiofred: liek this http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/9AKna/12/
[09:10:38] <dvgsvc> anyone?
[09:10:49] <ngharo> tiofred: oops -- this i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/9AKna/13/
[09:11:39] <kborchers> SEJeff_work: i think using .ajax is more intuitive and flexible but you could always do something like $.post(....).error(function() {...}); see ?post

[09:15:15] <Induane> I'm trying to setup a tabbed interface with jqueryui tabs  -  each tab has a couple chars on it that get initialized.  The two on the second tab are hidden initially
[09:15:30] <Induane> but when I go to the 2nd tab they have heigh/width still set to zero
[09:15:35] <Induane> http://pcdserver.dyndns.org/shiptrack/mi/shipments/dash
[09:15:38] <dvgsvc> which jquery directive gets triggered when i push the back button on the browser? .ready doesn't
[09:15:41] <Induane> thats the horrid page
[09:15:55] <Induane> Ignore nasty asthetics, just trying to get tabs to work properly
[09:16:18] <SEJeff_work> Induane, Try setting up a reproducer on jsfiddle or jsbin
[09:20:10] <Cracker2> how do I get a string out of $(this)?
[09:20:30] <Brodingo> what string
[09:20:36] <Cracker2> sec
[09:20:38] <Cracker2> oh w8
[09:20:50] * Cracker2 stupeed, forgot about .html(); ;)
[09:21:00] <Brodingo> or .text()
[09:21:13] <Brodingo> or .val() if its an input
[09:23:24] <JayNeely> Apologies in advance for some dumb questions... I'm trying to add jQuery mobile onto a project. I've added the script tag calling the minified .js file. Is the CSS file and image directory included in the package required? Where do I put them?
[09:24:25] <donmai> if I bind .hover() onto a bunch of divs, these divs must be removed() when I'm done with them, otherwise there will be a memory leak, correct?
[09:24:51] <donmai> i'm trying to figure out if the gc figures out that they're no longer in use
[09:25:02] <mehmet_> is there a selector expression that select .something:first after $(this)?
[09:25:24] <SlexAxton> JayNeely: css up at the top, image directory is relative to the css file
[09:25:38] <SlexAxton> you can look in your network panel to see where the requests are going
[09:25:45] <SlexAxton> there should be some good examples though
[09:26:05] <SlexAxton> donmai: eh... a few hover binds isn't that crazy
[09:26:13] <SlexAxton> if you're doing a ton, and worried about memory
[09:26:22] <SlexAxton> perhaps look into ?delegate
[09:26:30] <SlexAxton> docs#delegate
[09:26:31] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:26:38] <SlexAxton> i forget the lingo these days
[09:26:47] <SlexAxton> THANKS bot-t1
[09:26:48] * bot-t1 sighs
[09:27:03] <SlexAxton> (in gratitude)
[09:27:20] <kborchers> SlexAxton: you just forgot "see" ... see ?delegate
[09:27:21] <bot-t1> SlexAxton, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:27:40] <SlexAxton> mehmet_: see ?next
[09:27:41] <bot-t1> mehmet_, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:27:43] <donmai> oooh
[09:27:45] <donmai> that's nice
[09:28:05] <donmai> so if I understand this correctly, I will no longer have to bind it every time I load new content, correct?
[09:28:40] <SlexAxton> yes, that is a side effect of event delegation
[09:28:44] <SlexAxton> the parent has to remain
[09:28:53] <jwmann> How do I reload the page after an ajax call?
[09:29:09] <mehmet_> SlexAxton: thanks a lot.
[09:29:28] <SlexAxton> jwmann: why would you need to reload after an ajax call, isn't that the whole point of ajax?
[09:29:31] <SlexAxton> either way
[09:29:39] <SlexAxton> ?g window.location
[09:29:41] <bot-t1> SlexAxton, window.location - MDN Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.location
[09:29:52] <SlexAxton> window.location = 'http://google.com'
[09:30:02] <donmai> SlexAxton: after loading new content, do I have to mark the old content for the GC?
[09:30:11] <donmai> i would think yes, right?
[09:30:12] <jwmann> SlexAxton: Well; nothing is changing, but when I refresh; the changes take effect
[09:30:27] <SlexAxton> then why use ajax at all?
[09:30:36] <SlexAxton> donmai: are you done using the old content?
[09:31:16] <SlexAxton> if you had <div id="container"> <div /> <div /> <div /> </div>
[09:31:17] <donmai> SlexAxton: yep, don't want it anymore
[09:31:29] <donmai> SlexAxton: the use case is for chat messages that have scrolled off
[09:31:40] <jwmann> SlexAxton: Well, The AJAX call initates a function which then write data to the database, how do I update the page then?
[09:31:43] <SlexAxton> and you just did a $('#container').html('newcontent');
[09:31:48] <SlexAxton> that would wipe out everything
[09:31:55] <SlexAxton> just the same as explicitly calling remove
[09:32:06] <donmai> SlexAxton: thanks :]
[09:32:11] <SlexAxton> but calling remove works too
[09:32:18] <SlexAxton> pretty much if you have no more references to it
[09:32:25] <SlexAxton> it get garbage collected
[09:32:30] <JayNeely> SlexAxton: thanks. Would it be okay for me to blank the css file? All I really want from jQuery mobile is the orientationchange event.
[09:32:32] <SlexAxton> s*
[09:32:46] <SlexAxton> JayNeely: sounds like a terrible idea
[09:33:02] <jwmann> SlexAxton: Well, The AJAX call initates a php function which then writes data to the database, how do I update the page then?
[09:33:05] <JayNeely> =) What's a better way for me to go about this?
[09:33:07] <SlexAxton> why not just get code for the orientationchange event
[09:33:08] <grzegorz> hello! I am looking for help with positioning inside jquery-ui dialog
[09:33:38] <SlexAxton> jwmann: return data as a response
[09:33:42] <SlexAxton> and use that data to update the page
[09:33:47] <SlexAxton> that's the whole point of ajax
[09:33:56] <SlexAxton> if you just ajaxed something, then reloaded the page
[09:34:07] <lucenut> Hi guys. I found this example, but I want to just write some text rather than include an html page. $.fn.colorbox({href:"thankyou.html", open:true});
[09:34:08] <SlexAxton> then you probably could have just used normal html forms
[09:34:14] <lucenut> How would I do that?
[09:35:08] <SlexAxton> lucenut: http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/core/example2/index.html the inlinehtml demo is what you want
[09:35:17] <webfact> Is this okay? Seems to work, but its not subject to any race conditions or anything is it? $('a.foo').click(function() { $(this).get(0).hash = window.location.hash }
[09:35:27] <SlexAxton> ?ask @ grzegorz
[09:35:28] <bot-t1> grzegorz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:35:52] <lucenut> I got the code from that exact sample.
[09:36:04] <lucenut> But it is including an html page.
[09:36:21] <grzegorz> I can't solve problem with absolute positioning >> $().position() << inside of dialog. I doesn't work properly. The same function outside of dialog looks good
[09:36:52] <SlexAxton> lucenut: look harder, the line you should be looking at is: $(".example8").colorbox({width:"50%", inline:true, href:"#inline_example1"});
[09:36:57] <kborchers> ?demo @ grzegorz
[09:36:58] <bot-t1> grzegorz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:37:06] <djQuery> grzegorz: see ?demo
[09:37:07] <bot-t1> grzegorz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:37:36] <paul_irish_> i have a question for jquery users
[09:37:43] <lucenut> Slex, I don't understand.
[09:37:52] <SlexAxton> i can see that
[09:38:05] <thepacmanfan> anyone know how to use galleries with colorbox-load?
[09:38:29] <paul_irish_> we're trying to add support to jquery core for html5 sectioning elements. so you can ajax them in and such.. this would basically bake innerShiv into jquery.. question: would you think its confusing if you still need the html5shiv?
[09:38:53] <SlexAxton> yes
[09:38:55] <lucenut> If I want HELLO WORLD to appear in the dialog...
[09:39:04] <erichynds> yes
[09:39:09] <lucenut> What would that line look like?
[09:39:26] <ajpiano> paul_irish_: it's weird to have jquery have a hard dep on something else for something to work
[09:39:30] <lucenut> Oh, I want the dialog to open when the page loads too, not clicking a link.
[09:39:42] <SlexAxton> $(".example8").colorbox({width:"50%", inline:true, href:"#id_of_element_that_has_HELLO_WORLD_written_in_it"});
[09:40:02] <paul_irish_> so the distinction is that html5 elements in your document's markup need the html5 shiv
[09:40:08] <lucenut> Oh, it has to be in a div?
[09:40:13] <paul_irish_> elems that are added after domready fires.. they need this new innershiv behavior
[09:40:32] <SlexAxton> lucenut: it could really be any element type
[09:40:35] <SlexAxton> if you think about it
[09:40:42] <paul_irish_> we can address the elems in markup inside jquery, but it would require you to put jquery in the head of the page.
[09:41:02] <SlexAxton> paul_irish_: i think it's confusing, but correct
[09:41:08] <SlexAxton> document the hell out of it
[09:41:19] <ajpiano> i'm far from convinced :/
[09:41:41] <ajpiano> ppl been puttin jquery in the bottom of their page for awhile, now they're gonna have to move it back to the top or a new feature just doesn't work
[09:41:43] <ajpiano> ?
[09:41:47] <SlexAxton> i mean no html5shiv in jquery
[09:41:54] <SlexAxton> is the correct move
[09:41:56] <paul_irish_> no. they just include html5shiv in the page like they've been doing
[09:42:01] <SlexAxton> even though it's confusing
[09:42:07] <SlexAxton> that innershiv is in there
[09:42:50] <ajpiano> it strikes me as pretty bizarre to have the out of lib dep
[09:42:54] <erichynds> +1, I don't think it's jQuery's problem to solve
[09:42:54] <SlexAxton> i guess i pissed off lucenut?
[09:43:04] <ajpiano> we fill in for JSON.parse when it isn't there
[09:43:14] <SlexAxton> but not stringify
[09:43:19] <SlexAxton> we only fill in because we require it
[09:43:27] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:43:36] <SlexAxton> and it's not even technically a great parse...
[09:43:55] <ajpiano> granted
[09:44:03] <paul_irish_> its kind of like that fact that you get all these awesome selectors when you use jquery
[09:44:07] <paul_irish_> but your css can't use most of them
[09:44:18] <ajpiano> so if you don't include html5shiv before jquery, your html5 elems in je just don't work?
[09:44:20] <SlexAxton> i feel like we all have the same opinion
[09:44:22] <paul_irish_> "css3 selectors supported"
[09:44:35] <SlexAxton> ajpiano: they'll work if you use jquery to inject them
[09:44:37] <thepacmanfan> also, is there a good reason why i can't use galleries with colorbox-load?
[09:44:40] <paul_irish_> ^
[09:44:42] <ajpiano> o
[09:44:58] <ajpiano> so we'd just be not duping html5shiv for the initial stuff
[09:44:58] <ajpiano> ok
[09:45:01] <ajpiano> yeah now i get it
[09:45:04] <paul_irish_> yes
[09:45:11] <ajpiano> feels like 2009 in here
[09:45:17] <paul_irish_> :)
[09:45:19] <ajpiano> :D
[09:45:44] <SlexAxton> thepacmanfan: that's a pretty specific request, you might need to create some demo of what you're trying to do
[09:45:46] <SlexAxton> anyways
[09:45:49] <SlexAxton> im out for lunch
[09:45:50] <SlexAxton> bbl
[09:45:51] <paul_irish_> k
[09:45:56] <SlexAxton> <3z
[09:46:14] <paul_irish_> has this channel broken 900 yet
[09:46:20] <paul_irish_> over 900!?
[09:46:35] <thepacmanfan> SlexAxton, it's actually pretty simple i think... i'm trying to create a gallery of embedded Youtube videos.
[09:46:54] <SlexAxton> well then a demo should be super-easy!
[09:47:10] <thepacmanfan> class="colorbox-load" rel="ytgallery"   should do it
[09:47:22] <thepacmanfan> i guess i don't know what you mean by a demo.
[09:48:08] <SlexAxton> we don't really have any idea what class="colorbox-load" does in whatever plugin you're using, so generally if you put together a jsfiddle demo or similar
[09:48:11] <SlexAxton> we can introspect
[09:48:19] <SlexAxton> and figure out why it's not working
[09:48:56] <thepacmanfan> ohh, my bad. i thought colorbox-load was part of colorbox itself. anyway, not to delay your lunch...
[10:08:43] <jmut> ok to ask about jquery ready tools here?
[10:09:18] <lectrick> Is there a function to test for "null or undefined" in jquery?
[10:09:42] <lectrick> kind of like .blank? in ruby's active_support library
[10:12:11] <danzik171> lectrick: For just a plain variable?
[10:12:51] <lectrick> I have a function that takes (options), and options is not necessarily passed in but if it is it's a JSON, and I want to test for options.some_option
[10:12:55] <lectrick> danzik171: ^
[10:13:29] <danzik171> lectrick: options == null    will test for both null and undefined.
[10:13:38] <lectrick> thanks!
[10:13:56] <jmut> is there irc or place to ask for ready tools writtien in jquery?
[10:14:14] <jmut> I am looking for scroller...something like that http://logicbox.net/jquery/simplyscroll/#dl  but to speed up on hover of the arrows
[10:18:45] <kurisu> does anyone have experience with soundmanager2?
[10:19:10] <kurisu> or know id theres a sm2 irc channel?
[10:19:40] <lduros> hello, which way to create variables do you think is best between these two methods: http://www.jspaste.com/?id=328 -- and why :-)
[10:19:59] <shaft0> This might be a weird question, but essentially I have a table with data, and for each cell in the table, I want to have it so that if the text is small enough to appear in the cell as is, make that an editable text box (<input type=text) if not (as in, if it would wrap), make it a link to a lightbox with a textarea big enough to see the whole content, and then on save, put the edited text back
[10:20:00] <shaft0> into the cell, check width and repeat the process.  Is there a plugin to do this?
[10:21:40] <shaft0> I'm trying to do it on my own, but the tables are behaving like you would expect (cell width determined by amount of cells in a row), and because the content is dynamic, there could be one row with 5 columns, another with 3 (in different tables of course), so manually setting the width/max-width isn't feasible
[10:21:43] <ghost_trolley> Hi guys! Sorry to just burst in with a q
[10:22:25] <ghost_trolley> How would i display a string when i=1 etc
[10:23:30] <shaft0> what do you mean
[10:23:33] <lduros> ghost_trolley: you mean a for loop?
[10:23:44] <ghost_trolley> Yeah
[10:24:03] <lduros> ghost_trolley: where are your strings stored? in an array or something?
[10:24:03] <ghost_trolley> i have pagination going, but its displaying page numbers, i want each number to equal a catagory
[10:24:11] <shaft0> if (i=1) { }
[10:24:30] <lduros> shat0: you mean if( i == 1) {} or if (i === 1) {}
[10:24:37] <shaft0> but of course ;)
[10:24:43] <ghost_trolley> thanks ! :)
[10:25:06] <lduros> ghost_trolley:
[10:25:14] <lduros> you should store each category as part of an array
[10:25:25] <lduros> like:
[10:25:46] <grzegorz> hello! I am again with problem with positioning inside of dialog. please look into example: http://jsfiddle.net/abd8e/
[10:26:38] <grzegorz> I created the kind of checkbox. Normaly looks fine, but when I put into dialog - looks different
[10:27:04] <lduros> ghost_trolley: not sure if i understand what you want to do, but i think I'd do: var myCategories = ['category 1', 'category 2', 'category 3', 'category 4']; -- andd then: for (var i = 0; i < myCategories.length; i++) { //do something with myCategories[i]; }
[10:27:46] <ghost_trolley> Oh wow thanks
[10:27:50] <ghost_trolley> I think you do iduros haha
[10:28:21] <lduros> then you can use the "i" just for pagination purposes, that is, displaying a number, and the myCategories[i] for the actual name of it
[10:28:31] <ghost_trolley> Yeah, i want to replace those numbers with words
[10:28:37] <Ankabout> can anyone point me in the right direction to change this script: http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[10:28:37] <lduros> ok
[10:28:51] <Ankabout> basically I want to shuffle a bunch of words into each other
[10:29:03] <grzegorz> how you can see - the absolute positioning dosen't work...
[10:29:07] <Ankabout> word1- shuffle -word2 -shuffle- word3 etc.
[10:29:13] <Ankabout> the words would come from nested divs
[10:30:09] <grzegorz> I found also a few other times, that something is wrong with position() function inside of dialog.
[10:30:29] <grzegorz> Maybe you have any experience with this fault, how to solve it
[10:30:45] <ghost_trolley> iduros: what would i put in that last part of the code you pasted to me?
[10:32:01] <lduros> well, in what format do you want to output your categories? They would be links?
[10:32:20] <lduros> ghost_trolley: how would you like the end result to look on the page, is my question?
[10:34:22] <grzegorz> could anybody look into my my code, please? http://jsfiddle.net/abd8e/
[10:37:15] <ipo> hi
[10:37:35] <ipo> anybody knows how to change address bar in ajax action?
[10:40:13] <kborchers> grzegorz: so what exactly is the problem?
[10:40:51] <kkuno> hi
[10:40:58] <ipo> hi kkuno
[10:41:25] <ipo> how to change address bar when ajax is run?
[10:41:26] <booboonathan_> which is the jquery onloads
[10:41:34] <booboonathan_> which one is for loading when the page is fully loaded
[10:41:43] <booboonathan_> and which one is loading as soon as the first request is called?
[10:41:59] <kkuno> someone know if there is a way to use .toggle() specifying show_or_hide AND speed?
[10:42:36] <kkuno> I don't want to make a massive if...then...else to choose functions...
[10:42:36] <booboonathan_> as in, toggle(500); ?
[10:42:50] <kkuno> yeah but if I want to show(500)?
[10:42:51] <booboonathan_> or fadeToggle(500);
[10:43:55] <kkuno> this would be the best:
[10:44:01] <kkuno> func="slide"
[10:44:12] <kkuno> action="hide
[10:44:20] <booboonathan_> you've lost me
[10:44:36] <kkuno> $(element)[func](action,"slow")
[10:45:02] <kkuno> sorry func="slideToggle"
[10:45:08] <kborchers> grzegorz: your example is too complex. you will need to really simplify that to prove that it is an issue between dialog and position and not an issue with your markup
[10:45:28] <grzegorz> kborchers: please compare button on page and inside of dialog
[10:45:44] <kkuno> booboonathan_, with fadeToggle I can toggle show or hide
[10:45:52] <kkuno> but in some cases I want to lways show
[10:45:56] <kkuno> or always hide
[10:45:59] <grzegorz> the problem is with fault positioning of internal button (my widget) elements
[10:46:25] <kkuno> .toggle( showOrHide ) as it is shown here: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:46:27] <kkuno> is good
[10:46:32] <kkuno> but I can't set speed
[10:46:33] <kborchers> i see your problem but like i said, you need to create a reduced test case. no one is going to want to dig through all of that to try to find the root cause of the issue ... even if it is a bug, it would be almost impossible to determine that with this example
[10:46:57] <kkuno> if I want to set the speed, I must use the classic syntax, which is toggle only
[10:47:28] <Shadow6363> i'm trying to do a $(someSelect).val('Freezer') to select the Freezer text option in the dropdown (not the value) and it's not working. on the website, it seems to imply it should. using 1.6.3. any thoughts?
[10:51:01] <enjoycrf> anyone work w barcode generation
[10:51:03] <enjoycrf> ?
[10:51:07] <Ankabout> why wouldn't this work? $("." . $(this).text()).show();
[10:51:47] <kborchers> Ankabout: because you are using a . instead of a + for string concatination :/
[10:51:54] <Ankabout> oh damn
[10:52:00] <Ankabout> can't all languages just be the same?
[10:52:42] <Ankabout> thanks kborchers
[10:52:45] <kborchers> np
[10:58:29] <jwmann> This is my Ajax call - http://d.pr/u942 / This is the function that it calls http://d.pr/2cbb / I'm just wonder how I'd use that to update the data
[11:02:04] <SlexAxton> jwmann: that 'msg' that you send back can be data or html
[11:02:10] <SlexAxton> and then you can put it in the page
[11:03:12] <jwmann> SlexAxton: Okay, I'm not quite sure how I'd update the list with that
[11:03:35] <SlexAxton> well
[11:03:44] <SlexAxton> you'd probably have to change it's contents
[11:07:20] <jwmann> SlexAxton: Hmm, I still don't know how I'd make this work..
[11:07:59] <Ankabout> kborchers, any idea how I can easily make this script loop between elements, and shuffle one element into another, rather than shuffle out of nothing
[11:08:07] <Ankabout> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[11:09:08] <SlexAxton> jwmann: then stick to your guns, but if you're ever interested in non-reloading pages, look into ajax a little deeper
[11:10:01] <Dave_Stein> jwann: also look into ba-bbq :)
[11:10:13] <jwmann> SlexAxton: I'm interested, I just don't know how I'd update the list of objects on the page without having to reload the whole page
[11:10:34] <SlexAxton> if your string back was a list of objects
[11:10:38] <SlexAxton> you could do:
[11:10:51] <SlexAxton> $('#oldlist-container').html( msg );
[11:10:54] <SlexAxton> and it would be updated
[11:11:18] <jwmann> I see
[11:11:24] <jwmann> SlexAxton: I think I understand now.
[11:14:31] <doubletap> were there some event issues with jQuery and IE9? I seem to have some crossover between variables passed to the event handlers registered by separately scoped listeners.
[11:18:40] <Shadow6363> anyone know what's going on with setting a select value?
[11:19:27] <kborchers> Shadow6363: .val() only works with values
[11:20:00] <Shadow6363> kborchers: any idea how to set it based on text?
[11:20:46] <kborchers> ?contains @ Shadow6363
[11:20:47] <bot-t1> Shadow6363, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:23:18] <kborchers> Shadow6363: so something like $("select option:contains('Text')").prop("selected", true);
[11:24:10] <Shadow6363> kborchers: thank you so much! is there a reason to use prop instead of attr?
[11:24:22] <kborchers> because it's a property ;)
[11:26:14] <pingswept> What's the right way to overlay a clickable icon onto another element? If I just use .live ("mouseover mouseout"), the mouseout event occurs as soon as I move onto the icon.
[11:26:31] <pingswept> i.e. it disappears before I can click it.
[11:26:48] <kborchers> pingswept: check out mouseenter and mouseleave
[11:27:14] <pingswept> Ah, there's more subtlety to mouse events than I realized, I think.
[11:27:17] <pingswept> Thanks.
[11:29:35] <shaft0> I have a function that pops open a lightbox to edit content, and then saves the value when the user clicks 'save'.  It works, but it seems to keep a record of all the times it's been clicked, as if I edit a field, then edit another field, BOTH fields change.  Any ideas?
[11:33:50] <ipo> how to change address bar when ajax is run?
[11:38:10] <enjalot> how can i have an element hidden but not 100% transparent? so i can fade in and out to 20% opacity lets say

[11:39:42] <enjalot> Brodingo: any links to where i can read about 'wrapping it'? i'm new to jquery/js
[11:39:53] <Brodingo> in a div
[11:40:10] <Brodingo> err i guess fadeTo
[11:41:24] <enjalot> ah thank Brodingo i think thats the function i was looking for

[12:38:31] <ShawnRisk> I am using jquery and curious to know how to stop the slideshow from moving on this page: ecosanity.org but this didn't stop even when I took the code away.  Any ideas?
[12:38:54] <imsky> :V
[12:41:06] <ryanneufeld> ShawnRisk: if you removed the code, then it should stop
[12:41:34] <ryanneufeld> ShawnRisk: one of two things has happened 1) you didn't remove the right code, 2) your browser is loading a cached version from local or CDN
[12:42:02] <ShawnRisk> ryanneufeld: do you know which code to remove or change to just make this stop cycling?
[12:42:47] <ryanneufeld> ShawnRisk: no, I do not. I was simply pointing you in a direction for troubleshooting
[12:43:07] <ShawnRisk> you might be wrong, but I don't want to change or remove the wrong code
[12:43:35] <ShawnRisk> right*
[12:43:50] <ryanneufeld> that's what backups are for

[12:56:54] <jwmann> How do I properly iterate over JSON using jQuery? I keep getting weird errors
[12:58:00] <jmar777> ?each @ jwmann
[12:58:01] <bot-t1> jwmann, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:58:15] <jwmann> jmar777: I'm using that
[12:58:29] <jmar777> jwmann:  that wasn't the method i meant... on sec
[12:58:36] <tony722> Hi. I'm having trouble determining the correct jQuery syntax for removing all the li (and their nested children) from a UL except one. I can select the li I want to keep (and its children get selected) but when I turn that around to a ":not" the children are not excluded and get removed too.
[12:58:38] <lduros> jwmann: you can also do, data.length and then a for loop
[12:58:55] <jmar777> jwmann: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[12:59:15] <jmar777> jwmann: or, alternatively, do use a "for in" loop
[12:59:18] <lduros> len = data.length; for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) { // do something with data[i] }
[12:59:28] <lduros> or a for in loop
[12:59:29] <lduros> yeh
[13:00:05] <tony722> <ul> 	<li>books 		<ul> 			<li>book 1</li> 			<li>book 2</li> 		</ul> 	</li> 	<li>pizza 		<ul> 			<li>pizza 1</li> 			<li>pizza 2</li> 		</ul> 	</li>	 	<li>cars 		<ul> 			<li>car 1</li> 			<li>car 2</li> 		</ul> 	</li> </ul>
[13:00:12] <blahblah> so this is really strange. Using jqueryUI menu, when I clicka  menu item, statechange occurs correctly in Chrome, FF3.6>, Safari, IE etc, The new page is ajaxed in via the statechange (History.js). The next time i click the menu, the url is trimmed down to the www.sub.domain.com/#
[13:00:18] <lduros> wow
[13:00:18] <tony722> How would I remove everything but pizza (and keep the child pizzas)
[13:00:38] <jwmann> I'm using that but I get weird errors http://d.pr/oG50
[13:00:57] <Dave_Stein> tony722 you can loop through all the LIs. check the HTML, and remove when it matches what you want
[13:01:09] <Dave_Stein> although really pizza should have an id
[13:01:10] <jmar777> jwmann: can you do a jsfiddle? that's wierd
[13:01:11] <lduros> jwmann: is your json well formatted?
[13:01:26] <blahblah> jwmann, u can use a simple $.each or$ $.map
[13:01:28] <tony722> It does I wast trying to keep the question simple.
[13:01:35] <Dave_Stein> tony722: <li item_id="5">Pizza</a> $('[item_id=5').remove()
[13:01:39] <jwmann> blahblah: I tried a $.each too

[13:01:59] <tony722> Expect I want to remove the ones that are NOT pizza.
[13:02:09] <tony722> And that ends up removing pizza's children.
[13:02:28] <Dave_Stein> item_id^=5 I believe... i forget.. check docs on attr

[13:05:35] <jwmann> lduros: I'm pretty sure it's formatted properly - http://d.pr/doXu
[13:07:01] <blahblah> it's valid
[13:07:21] <jmar777> jwmann: what are you trying to iterate then? the array, or the objets in the array?
[13:07:40] <jinxdone> Jason[Groupon], typically the way to work around that is to create a transparent element ontop of the upload button
[13:07:41] <Dave_Stein> tony722 - that cover it?
[13:07:47] <jwmann> I'm  trying to reproduce a list of path
[13:08:20] <jmar777> jwmann: can you describe that differently?
[13:08:28] <tony722> Thanks! I'm trying to mock up on jsfiddle. Unfortunately, It's a hosted situation where I can't do much with the HTML... So I'm trying to mod it with jQuery. I'll get a jfiddle link shortly.
[13:09:02] <jwmann> jmar777: I'm trying to the javascript equivalent to this php loop http://pastie.org/2504699
[13:09:14] <Jason[Groupon]> jinxdone: indeed, it was just a messy implementation.  running $("#fileupload).trigger("click"); works in most browsers, firefox 3, however, is not one of them
[13:10:27] <jmar777> jwmann: can you show the code that's generating the error? (preferably as a jsfiddle)
[13:13:13] * muzone is now watching: http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/
[13:15:14] <jwmann> jmar777: I'm not sure how.
[13:15:27] <jwmann> jmar777: The json is an ajax response
[13:17:02] <jwmann> jmar777: Wait I think I can
[13:17:05] <jmar777> well, can you just paste whatever you're doing in your success handler? it's ok if it doesn't run
[13:20:12] <tony722> OK I've posted it to: http://jsfiddle.net/JkT2R/
[13:21:04] <tony722> http://jsfiddle.net/JkT2R/5/ includes a fix: I'm trying to remove everyting but pizza.

[13:21:20] <jwmann> jmar777: http://jsfiddle.net/n9LJy/
[13:21:30] <tony722> And unfortunately I can't modify the source HTML much in my  situation
[13:25:05] <jmar777> jwmann: you're wrapping a regular object as a jQuery object, which isn't valid. does this help make sense of it? http://jsfiddle.net/n9LJy/1/
[13:26:44] <Tubarao_Sartinha> Hi all!
[13:27:07] <jmar777> jwmann: e.g., this is how you would start using those objects to build out some new elements: http://jsfiddle.net/n9LJy/2/

[13:48:32] <ProLoser|Work> you want to remove the dom elements or the href?
[13:48:43] <ProLoser|Work> why not just use classes?
[13:48:59] <tony722> Dom elements I want just the Pizza UL in its entirety
[13:49:45] <ProLoser|Work> um
[13:50:11] <tony722> Unfortunately the HTML I have to work with isn't directly modifiable (Server generated). But I want to get rid of the books and cars.
[13:50:59] <jinxdone> tony722, how about using the child css selectors >
[13:51:04] <ProLoser|Work> i would almost do $("#testDiv>ul>li>a:not([href*=pizza])").parent().remove()
[13:51:09] <jinxdone> so, #testDiv > ul > li ....
[13:51:26] <jinxdone> that way it won't match the li's that are deeper in the tree

[13:54:26] <tony722> ravenzz thanks! That works. One question: I read that > is being deprecated. Is that true? And if so what would be the preferred way?
[13:55:05] <ProLoser|Work> tony722: i think you heard wrong
[13:55:19] <jbrokc> is there anything obviously wrong with $("foo").css('margin-left', '-' + (tt.width() / 2) + 'px'); ?
[13:55:32] <jbrokc> sorry - tt there should be foo

[13:56:15] <ProLoser|Work> someone want to help me now?
[13:56:17] <ravenzz> anyway I don't know, and I don't know how they would do that
[13:56:26] <tony722> I guess my confusion was on the http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/ But perhaps it's some other syntax that's being deprecated. ;) Sorry.
[13:56:33] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work ask?
[13:56:35] <tony722> Thanks again so much for your help!!
[13:56:49] <tony722> I really appreciate it
[13:56:56] <ProLoser|Work> utility function for creating list-items or options
[13:57:10] <ProLoser|Work> and returns the collection ready to be injected into the dom where i choose
[13:57:35] <ProLoser|Work> so i have 2 problems, how do i concatenate multiple $("<li>") together?
[13:57:44] <ravenzz> tony722 anyway it isn't that correct! If you inspect the container you will see some empty ULs
[13:57:47] <ProLoser|Work> just $("<li>") + $("li")?
[13:58:29] <ahandy> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/nNaPs/
[13:58:35] <tony722> Oh--yeah jsFiddle doesn't show the actual ULs
[13:59:02] <ahandy> ravenzz: im trying to calculate the width of the h2 and then make the paragraph below it text-align: justify and set the width to exactly the one of the header
[14:00:00] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work can't you create Its container and append each item on it?
[14:00:38] <ravenzz> ?selectors @ ahandy
[14:00:39] <bot-t1> ahandy, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[14:00:40] <ProLoser|Work> no, i need to not make any assumptions about containers
[14:00:50] <ProLoser|Work> i thought of actually making a fake container and then stripping it after
[14:00:50] <ahandy> ravenzz: what about it
[14:01:10] <jwmann> Is it possible to use jQuery to move div element before another div?
[14:01:10] <ravenzz> var test1 = document.getElementById("test1"); why?
[14:01:35] <ravenzz> ahandy also you should include jQuery
[14:01:55] <ahandy> ravenzz: im sorry must've copied the old version of the code. here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/nNaPs/
[14:01:59] <jwmann> is it possible to do div#foo div#bar => div#bar div#foo
[14:03:01] <tra_> jwmann: http://api.jquery.com/before/ this might help you out
[14:04:01] <ahandy> ravenzz: would you be kind enough to provide a fix?
[14:04:21] <tsb> Lets say I have an ul with 10 li elements. Five of those has an "a" element, and I want to select all the others that does not contain an a element. I've tried :not(:contains()), which doesn't work because contains operatess on text..
[14:06:21] <tony722> ravenzz OK it tested your solution in Chrome and Firefox and it works--and does not leave any ULs hanging around. :-) Thanks again!
[14:09:59] <dpritchett> Is it possible to send a POST request to another domain via JS?
[14:13:20] <jwmann> How would I make 'Two' appear before 'One' - http://jsfiddle.net/jEhVH/
[14:14:21] <tsb> Ah, :has!
[14:15:32] <ravenzz> ahandy http://jsfiddle.net/svQT6/1/
[14:16:28] <ravenzz> ahandy but I would ask to the #css' guys before to go for the js solution
[14:17:01] <ahandy> ravenzz: css works fine, however there's a font difference between different browsers. so js is the perfect solution
[14:18:22] <rav_> hello. i am tryin to use the jquery-ui accordion plugin, but it doesn't show the full text inside the <div>
[14:18:29] <ProLoser|Work> why the crap isn't this working? http://jsfiddle.net/xZFNV/
[14:18:37] <ProLoser|Work> says method html() is undefined
[14:18:51] <ProLoser|Work> or uh that $('ul') is undefined
[14:19:01] <dpritchett> jwmann, $("#1").prepend($("#1").siblings()[0])
[14:20:39] <jwmann> dpritchett: Awesome, can it go the other direction too?
[14:21:01] <dpritchett> i think siblings is all same-level elements aside from the given element
[14:21:16] <ahandy> ravenzz: weird. works on jsfiddle but not locally
[14:24:16] <jwmann> dpritchett: It seems to have broken in this case.
[14:24:20] <jwmann> dpritchett: http://jsfiddle.net/jEhVH/2/
[14:24:56] <jwmann> dpritchett: I'm trying to make 'Two' go before 'One' or after 'Three'
[14:25:44] <ProLoser|Work> how do i concatenate multiple jquery dom snippets together?
[14:25:55] <ahandy> ravenzz: when i document.write the code you gave me, it says that the width is set to 430px, whereas the header is about 250px;
[14:26:23] <jwmann> ProLoser|Work: $("blah"+"bler").dothis().dothat()
[14:26:37] <ProLoser|Work> no
[14:27:00] <ProLoser|Work> $('<li>') + $('<li>') + $('li');
[14:27:03] <ProLoser|Work> how do i do that
[14:27:10] <ProLoser|Work> erm assuming the last one had <>
[14:27:17] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/UPAap/
[14:27:36] <ProLoser|Work> can't make assumptions about containers
[14:27:48] <ravenzz> It is a temporary container
[14:27:55] <ravenzz> you append your elements
[14:27:56] <jwmann> $("<li>"+"<li>"+"<li>")
[14:28:12] <ProLoser|Work> ah i see
[14:28:13] <ProLoser|Work> .html()
[14:28:21] <jwmann> ProLoser|Work: Although, with jQuery you don't need to specify that brackets
[14:28:22] <ahandy> ravenzz: any idea why?
[14:28:40] <ravenzz> but maybe you should ask someone else,
[14:28:45] <jwmann> ProLoser|Work: You should do this $("li"+"li"+"li")
[14:29:14] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work I would suggest to you to write pau and press tab :p
[14:29:42] <ravenzz> ahandy are you still talking about my fiddle?
[14:29:58] <booboonathan_> Does anyone remember the iWeb gallery, where you could hover over an icon and depending on the section of the thumbnail you hovered on, the image would change?
[14:30:23] <ProLoser|Work> ravenzz: why?
[14:30:24] <ahandy> ravenzz: yea. works on jsfiddle but not locally. it's getting the wrong wdith
[14:30:36] <ProLoser|Work> your solution works
[14:30:44] <ProLoser|Work> i felt it might be more overhead than just ignoring a container altogether
[14:30:47] <ProLoser|Work> thanks
[14:31:16] <ahandy> ravenzz: oh. it's something wrong with y code.
[14:31:27] <ahandy> ravenzz: wait no nevermind. works on jsfiddle!
[14:32:15] <rav_> why would autoHeight:false wouldn't work on a jquery-ui accordion?
[14:32:53] <booboonathan_> #php
[14:32:55] <booboonathan_> oops
[14:34:14] <cpgo> having trouble detecting resize event within iframe so I can resize the parent,  $(window).resize isnt working. Any suggestions
[14:35:04] <ahandy> ravenzz: any idea why it might work on jsfiddle but not locally?
[14:35:34] <ravenzz> because of the  display:inline property I added to the css?
[14:35:47] <ravenzz> (to the h2 elem)
[14:36:13] <ahandy> ravenzz: i added it to my css.
[14:37:32] <ravenzz> uhm so I don't know
[14:37:59] <crankharder> is there a way to add an IMG tag to a jquery UI button?
[14:38:14] <ravenzz> It is stupid but did you change the container name?
[14:38:51] <ahandy> ravenzz: yes. ill figure it out
[14:41:23] <ravenzz> I'll go to sleep
[14:41:26] <ravenzz> bye
[15:00:04] <jwmann> jQuery method for removing a DOM element?
[15:00:31] <Rotham> hey.. is there an easy way to add or remove accordion tabs?
[15:01:56] <eddiemonge> ?remove @ jwmann
[15:01:57] <bot-t1> jwmann, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[15:04:08] <cpgo> when doing $('#previewer').css('height', '500px'); on an iframe, the iframe just goes black and hangs the browser
[15:09:56] <Blazento> hi i need a little horizontal bar with things auto-scrolling across it.. like a stock ticker... anyone know what would be a suitable plugin to start with?
[15:20:08] <juso> is there a way to resize a site so it takes up the width on a large monitor and a small monitor due to resolution changes
[15:33:11] <chovy> how do i run a function when a radio button is clicked?
[15:33:29] <chovy> $("input[type=radio]").click(function(e){ }); did not work.
[15:36:12] <zeppo> try the :radio selector
[15:36:59] <danzik171> chovy: You're missing quotes in that selector.  $('input[type="radio"]')
[15:39:36] <chovy> danzik171: that sholdn't matter, and it doesn't work anyway.
[15:42:51] <chovy> nevermind, i found my problem.
[15:42:57] <danzik171> chovy: Yes, it does - can you make a jsfiddle
[15:43:00] <danzik171> k
[15:43:08] <chovy> danzik171: it doesn't.
[15:43:20] <chovy> $("input[name=notifications][value=unsubscribe]") is perfectly valid.
[15:43:55] <danzik171> chovy: The event works fine, not referring to the selector.
[15:44:19] <chovy> i found out why my event didn't fire. it was something else.
[15:44:31] <chovy> but the name='foo' is not necessary.
[15:54:10] <sodapop> i am trying to get the height of an image coming from an ajax call using .height() in ajax complete:, it always returns 0
[15:54:46] <nikaoli_> hello
[15:55:08] <nikaoli_> can someone help me with finding a "slide left" solution for my submenu?
[15:55:54] <nikaoli_> it seems that the show() function by default makes list items slide up and down when unhiding a hidden item
[15:56:06] <nikaoli_> or any hidden element for that matter
[15:57:46] <nikaoli_> ??????
[16:07:56] <zeppo> nikaoli_: check out .animate()
[16:10:31] <nikaoli_> animate({display:inline}) ?
[16:10:41] <nikaoli_> i think i tried that and it does the same thing
[16:10:43] <tfitts> does anyone here use jCarousel? How do you set the max size of the carousel?
[16:10:45] <nikaoli_> http://65.75.121.104:8888/motb
[16:10:55] <nikaoli_> can you access that?>

[16:30:32] <Jobbe> Hi
[16:30:59] <Jobbe> Question, I've made a voting system, but i have a problem with jquery
[16:31:08] <ColKurtz> what's up Jobbe
[16:31:13] <Jobbe> it works, but when i load too much data then the voting system don't work
[16:31:16] <Jobbe> http://partyho.wep.dk/?p=1
[16:31:19] <Jobbe> example there
[16:31:54] <Jobbe> if you load a few pages of data (click the blue bar at the bottom that says "IndlÃ¦s 50 mere..")
[16:31:58] <Jobbe> then it stops working
[16:34:18] <Jobbe> it does run the script - but it does not change the votebox
[16:36:10] <Jobbe> ColKurtz: any idea why this happens?
[16:36:24] <ColKurtz> nope sorry i don't have enough time to look
[16:36:26] <ColKurtz> gl though
[16:36:36] <Jobbe> gl ?
[16:40:46] <ColKurtz> good lucik
[16:41:24] <Jobbe> ahhâ€¦ thanks ColKurtz
[17:08:00] <Kamakazi> would a malformed JSON string be something that could cause JSON.parse to send back a response of [object Object],[object Object] (etc. etc.)
[17:08:43] <ColKurtz> possibly
[17:09:03] <ColKurtz> i think.
[17:10:03] <Kamakazi> just never had it do this before
[17:10:13] <ColKurtz> do a console.log(theResponse)
[17:10:18] <ColKurtz> and see what it says
[17:11:53] <Kamakazi> well JSONLint says it is legit
[17:14:48] <Kamakazi> and the console shows an apparently legit message

[17:38:31] <ridethefire122> Could someone please explain why the media players on the following site work in opera and chrome, but not firefox, IE and Safari? http://inyourspeakers.com/
[17:39:40] <snover> try asking your debugger.
[17:40:12] <ridethefire122> snover were you being a prick, or were you trying to be helpful?
[17:40:31] <snover> Iâ€™m happy to be both at once
[17:40:37] <snover> please finger me
[17:40:57] <ridethefire122> ?
[17:41:03] * ColKurtz fingers snover 
[17:41:36] <Jobbe> feed the horse
[17:42:08] <ridethefire122> also, is a debugger a person or a program?
[17:42:10] <snover> Generally speaking the big red ERROR JQUERY IS NOT DEFINED is a good first place to investigate
[17:43:45] <ajpiano> ridethefire122: a debugger is a program.
[17:43:52] <ajpiano> it tells you important things
[17:43:56] <ajpiano> like that jquery isn't defined
[17:44:18] <ColKurtz> maybe jquery is cached in opera and chrome
[17:44:23] <ColKurtz> but not in firefox/ie/safari
[17:44:54] <ColKurtz> well wait a minute
[17:45:01] <ColKurtz> that doesn't make much sense
[17:47:57] <ridethefire122> hm
[17:50:40] <ridethefire122> wtf is going on here
[17:51:47] <zwick> My guess is that by 'debugger' snover meant 'the error console'
[17:52:02] <ridethefire122> yeah, but I'm still not seeing wtf is wrong here
[17:52:26] <zwick> What if anything is reported?
[17:57:40] <ridethefire122> class is a reserved identifier
[17:57:40] <ridethefire122> [Break On This Error] Drupal.jPlayer.marquee = function(class) {
[17:58:16] <coldhead> call it something else
[17:58:23] <ridethefire122> yeah, I'm going to
[18:08:57] <ridethefire122> hm
[18:09:02] <ridethefire122> fixed that
[18:09:03] <ridethefire122> now XML tag name mismatch (expected link)
[18:15:12] <ridethefire122> fixed that
[18:15:15] <ridethefire122> now "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://inyourspeakers.com/js/jquery.marquee.js"
[18:15:29] <ridethefire122> thing is, there shouldn't be a jquery.marquee.js
[18:27:33] <bananasontoast> Hey guys, is there a way I can assign a form value to a non-form element using jQuery? i.e. I want to have a div that beeves kind of like a radio button with an on/off state and holds a value?
[18:31:57] <ridethefire122> ok, and it looks like we're back to this "jquery is not defined business"
[18:44:15] <Spadeski> Jplayer How do I skin the middle of it ?
[18:44:30] <Spadeski> like make it shorter in height i cannot find the css handle to do it
[18:45:11] <xckpd7> can anyone recommend javascript enlightenment by cody lindley?
[19:11:53] <Spadeski> http://pastebin.com/9FxK91Zj Can someone tell me why it wont send to the page

[19:16:42] <JesperA> Anyone knows how to use BuddyPress profile fields in the WordPress loop?
[19:34:26] <ngharo> Spadeski: perhaps you should try using jquery ...
[19:34:48] <coldhead> i've heard of that!
[19:37:07] <coldhead> what was all that about
[19:39:41] <ngharo> i farted

[19:49:38] <coldhead> well done everyone
[20:16:34] <Techdeck> hey guys, a homepage I built has a really weird issue... when I do something like $('img').attr("src", "...").load(function() {}); -- is it possible that this doesn't run when the browser is minimized? I reproduced this bug both on FF6 and Chrome... any thoughts? :\
[20:17:27] <Techdeck> it's really screwing me and impossible to debug
[20:24:25] <_rob_> why is it impossible to debug?
[20:28:07] <Techdeck`> cause it's not reproducing every time
[20:28:15] <Techdeck`> I'm not 100% sure what is causing it
[20:28:39] <_rob_> is it within an event callback?
[20:28:58] <Techdeck`> I'm not sure because of a lot of things are supposed to change on that page using that mechanism
[20:29:05] <Techdeck`> and some of them change, some of them don't
[20:29:07] * Techdeck` headdesks
[20:29:17] <_rob_> so it's not your code?
[20:29:19] <Techdeck`> sorry, let me try to reproduce and then I'll bug you guys again
[20:29:32] <Techdeck`> it is
[20:31:09] <falcom> anyone know a good jquery carousel, i want it to slide divs
[20:32:17] <_rob_> cycle

[20:46:24] <_rob_> cycle rocks
[21:03:24] <idefine> hi, when using jquery ui's dialog is it possible to position the dialog offscreen on close instead of actually hiding it?
[21:03:50] <idefine> and remove the overlay?
[21:06:54] <idefine> hmm, is there just a way to remove the overlay when using a dialog as a modal?
[21:13:42] <coldhead> idefine: if you inspect the state of the page when the modal is showing, you should be able to see the relevant CSS to hide or remove
[21:13:53] <coldhead> sorry i can't be more helpful
[21:13:58] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:14:23] <idefine> coldhead: I am able to do that, but i still can't type in any input elements in the background
[21:14:32] <coldhead> weird
[21:14:38] <coldhead> there must be an actual overlay
[21:14:40] <idefine> however clicks on buttons seems to work interestingly enough
[21:14:43] <coldhead> that you might need to delete()
[21:14:48] <coldhead> or remove()*
[21:14:58] <idefine> coldhead: there is, i did do a remove on the overlay, but no go
[21:15:13] <coldhead> maybe use a modal that doesn't have an overlay?
[21:15:21] <coldhead> aka a non-blocking modal
[21:15:24] <coldhead> or popup?
[21:16:19] <idefine> i do want an overlay when display, but when i close I don't want to hide, i want to position it off screen
[21:21:00] <AfroTurf> does $(window).unload() work when you press the back and forward buttons on the browser?
[21:22:04] <AfroTurf> only fires for me when i refresh the page
[21:22:18] <Cork> no its disabled on reload for newer browsers
[21:22:29] <Cork> theres an alternative event for that
[21:23:30] <AfroTurf> something about beforeunload
[21:23:37] <Cork> no
[21:23:45] <Cork> one min and i'll dig up the event
[21:23:53] <AfroTurf> thanks a bunch
[21:26:40] <Cork> ah ya, its wasn't a different event
[21:26:54] <Cork> but you need to bind unload to get load on back
[21:27:25] <Cork> ugg. i miss read your comment >_>
[21:27:36] <AfroTurf> hmm
[21:27:39] <Cork> AfroTurf: yes beforeunload is what you want
[21:27:47] <Cork> (i read unload as onload >_<''')
[21:27:52] <AfroTurf> ooh lol
[21:28:02] <AfroTurf> so $(window).beforeunload()
[21:28:06] <Cork> ya
[21:28:48] <Cork> unload should trigger when the page is left, but if you want to warn/abort it, beforeunload is needed
[21:29:14] <AfroTurf> which version of jquery do i need for that event
[21:29:32] <Cork> $().bind('beforeunload')
[21:29:37] <AfroTurf> ah thanks
[21:30:24] <AfroTurf> hmm still not fireing
[21:31:00] <Cork> ah! lol
[21:31:09] <Cork> you should bind it agenst body and not window
[21:31:18] <AfroTurf> aaah thanks
[21:31:29] <AfroTurf> makes sense
[21:32:19] <AfroTurf> still no go :(
[21:32:28] <Todd_LEFTART> $() is empty ?
[21:32:57] <Cork> AfroTurf: what is it your trying to do?
[21:33:15] <AfroTurf> $("body").bind("beforeunload", function() { alert("unloaded"); });
[21:33:20] <AfroTurf> just something simple for now
[21:33:30] <Todd_LEFTART> don't quote body
[21:33:35] <AfroTurf> ah duh
[21:33:38] <Todd_LEFTART> and it should be document.body
[21:33:54] <Cork> Todd_LEFTART: no "body" is fine
[21:34:04] <Todd_LEFTART> I thought it should be $(window).bind....
[21:34:07] <Cork> actually document.body can fail sometimes
[21:34:12] <Spadeski> Sup everyone
[21:34:27] <Todd_LEFTART> ohh, yes, I misunderstand
[21:34:36] <Todd_LEFTART> $("body") is ok
[21:34:39] <Cork> AfroTurf: anyway i'm not sure you'r allowed to show alerts from the handlers
[21:34:46] <Spadeski> Anyone here good in jPlayer mind a PM ?
[21:35:02] <AfroTurf> Cork: i can show alerts when i reload the page using window
[21:35:09] <Cork> AfroTurf: give me a min, i need to fiddle with it a bit, was too long since i worked with unload/beforeunload
[21:36:03] <Todd_LEFTART> beforeunload is event of window, and you can't not show alert in it yourself
[21:36:17] <Todd_LEFTART> return a string
[21:36:26] <Todd_LEFTART> browser will show it for you
[21:36:32] <Cork> no they won't
[21:36:36] <AfroTurf> Cork: i'm pretty much going back n' forth between mydomain.com/#foo and mydomain.com/#bar
[21:36:46] <Cork> Todd_LEFTART: browsers show a default message now days
[21:37:16] <Todd_LEFTART> yeah, but your returned message will be append
[21:37:24] <Todd_LEFTART> will be included
[21:37:35] <Todd_LEFTART> right?
[21:37:57] <Cork> AfroTurf: "Blocked alert('unloading') during unload." "Blocked alert('unloading') during beforeunload."
[21:38:07] <Cork> so ya its blocked
[21:38:30] <AfroTurf> i get it to run when i reload the page though
[21:38:40] <AfroTurf> or close the window
[21:38:44] <Cork> AfroTurf: but ya its window and not body, sorry about that'
[21:38:49] <nikaoli_> hi
[21:39:00] <Cork> AfroTurf: that would depend on the browser though
[21:39:06] <AfroTurf> firefox
[21:39:15] <Cork> AfroTurf: that would be a bug then
[21:39:25] <Cork> both are meant to block alerts
[21:39:38] <Todd_LEFTART> window.onbeforeunload = function(){return "are you sure to leave?";}
[21:39:48] <Todd_LEFTART> that's what you can do
[21:39:49] <AfroTurf>  $(window).bind("beforeunload", function() { alert("unloaded"); }); will fire when i close or reload page.. but not pressing back and forth buttons in browser
[21:40:08] <AfroTurf> ok let's try that
[21:41:41] <AfroTurf> hmm no go
[21:42:30] <AfroTurf> soo weird.. isn't that what i need to fire events when back and forth are pressed
[21:44:37] <zilly> Is there anything that would make jquery unable to do href selection on URLs in IE?  It's working in every browser except IE.
[21:44:37] <Todd_LEFTART> i tried it in FF6, it works
[21:45:40] <AfroTurf> gaah
[21:46:13] <AfroTurf> ah ok
[21:46:25] <AfroTurf> i see what's happening now
[21:46:31] <Todd_LEFTART> and it works better in Google Chrome
[21:46:49] <Todd_LEFTART> FF eat my returned message "are you sure to leave"
[21:47:14] <Cork> Todd_LEFTART: thats intentional
[21:47:14] <AfroTurf> domain.com/#foo and domain.com/#bar going back and forth between those doesnt' fire unload or beforeunload
[21:47:30] <AfroTurf> because it never unloads
[21:47:49] <Cork> ya, it stays in mem cache, though about it, but wans't sure
[21:47:56] <Cork> Todd_LEFTART: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=588292
[21:48:49] <AfroTurf> so whats the dom of the back n' forth buttons
[21:49:30] <Todd_LEFTART> Cork: that makes sense
[21:49:32] <Cork> AfroTurf: try binding pagehide
[21:50:10] <Cork> but you need both unload and pagehide to be cross browser compatible
[21:50:18] <AfroTurf> bind("pagehide");
[21:50:44] <Cork> bind("unload pagehide");
[21:51:48] <AfroTurf> that works too but i figured out my problem.
[21:51:59] <Cork> AfroTurf: btw oh, hash changes doesn't actually do anything to the page
[21:52:10] <AfroTurf> ya just figured that out
[21:52:11] <Cork> its all inpage events
[21:52:29] <AfroTurf> so i need to fire when back n' forth is pressed directly i guess
[21:52:50] <Cork> AfroTurf: i think what you want is to push history events
[21:52:52] <dr0id> who uses ckeditor here ?
[21:52:57] <AfroTurf> yes history
[21:53:59] <Cork> AfroTurf: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/webinar-history-api-with-syd-lawrence/
[21:54:33] <Cork> AfroTurf: or rather https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#The_pushState().C2.A0method
[21:55:13] <TheCode> are you guys kungfu fighting?
[21:55:18] <AfroTurf> cool
[21:55:55] <Cork> AfroTurf: as always though, ie is the slow none supporter :/
[21:56:04] <Cork> *sole
[21:56:14] <TheCode> ie can go to hell
[21:56:24] <Todd_LEFTART> it should
[21:56:32] <TheCode> we should not support ie
[21:56:38] <coldhead> i don't
[21:56:41] <AfroTurf> i don't :)
[21:56:42] <coldhead> except financially
[21:56:44] <TheCode> turn table around
[21:56:48] <coldhead> i give ms a tithe
[21:57:00] <coldhead> may god have mercy on my soul
[21:57:01] <Todd_LEFTART> but a lot of bosses are using ie
[21:57:17] <Todd_LEFTART> and I have to get money from them, so sad
[21:57:23] <AfroTurf> ah cool someone made an event plugin for what i want to do
[21:57:27] <AfroTurf> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[21:57:52] <Cork> AfroTurf: a warning though, its built around setInterval
[21:57:58] <Todd_LEFTART> ahh, I heard about that
[21:58:03] <AfroTurf> :/
[21:58:11] <TheCode> haha
[21:58:14] <Cork> it pulls the window.location.hash with interval and checks if it changes
[21:58:19] <AfroTurf> booo
[21:58:26] <TheCode> most modern pcs should be fine with it, I guess
[21:58:29] <danieliser> any good articles on developing plugins to be more efficient? i am writing an app that is gonna be using a lot of ajax modals and refreshes. I have written a plugin but i feel i could get more efficient use
[21:58:53] <AfroTurf> is there no way to access the back button
[21:59:04] <TheCode> history
[21:59:14] <AfroTurf> or maybe just check if history has changed
[21:59:15] <Cork> AfroTurf: through the popstate event
[21:59:29] <Cork> should be listed on the mdc page
[21:59:56] <Cork> AfroTurf: but as i said, not supported by ie
[22:00:02] <AfroTurf> :(
[22:00:08] <AfroTurf> ya that would work perfectly
[22:00:22] <nikaoli_> http://65.75.121.104:8888/motb/
[22:00:28] <nikaoli_> can someone help me with my menu?
[22:00:47] <Cork> ?ask @ nikaoli_
[22:00:47] <bot-t> nikaoli_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:00:51] <nikaoli_> i have a show function on the "marks" button
[22:01:11] <nikaoli_> it reveals the sub menu, but it does it in a yucky way
[22:01:41] <nikaoli_> i tried setting the sub menu to a width of 0, and using animate({width:100%}) and that did not work
[22:02:24] <Cork> nikaoli_: overflow: hidden?
[22:02:37] <nikaoli_> i basically want my submenu to slide out from "marks" while in between marks and beasts
[22:02:42] <nikaoli_> i'll try that
[22:03:16] <nikaoli_> still doesnt work
[22:03:28] <AfroTurf> Cork: beatport.com does exactly what i want
[22:03:44] <nikaoli_> its still doing that nasty "drop down and put back in place" effect
[22:04:15] <Cork> nikaoli_: do $('#menu-main-menu').hide(); on load and $('#menu-main-menu').show(300'); when you show the menu
[22:04:28] <Cork> *show(300);
[22:04:39] <Cork> and of cource hide(300) when it hides
[22:04:59] <nikaoli_> i dont want to hide my main menu
[22:05:27] <nikaoli_> i dont think you understand what i mean
[22:05:33] <Cork> what menu are you talking about then?
[22:05:43] <nikaoli_> my menu works fine, click on "marks" to reveal the sub menu
[22:05:51] <Cork> ah
[22:05:56] <Cork> that one :D
[22:05:57] <nikaoli_> the reveal is the problem
[22:06:20] <nikaoli_> it drops down all of the links that are to the right of it, then it puts them back in place
[22:06:40] <Cork> nikaoli_: your writing broken html
[22:06:41] <nikaoli_> i prefer for the links to the right to slide to the right to allow space for the newly revealed submenu of "marksbody"
[22:06:53] <Cork> your not alowed to put divs inside ul's
[22:07:32] <Cork> put the ul as a child of the li with the a link instead
[22:07:38] <nikaoli_> well is there another way for me to get my list children on the same line as the parents
[22:07:57] <nikaoli_> ?
[22:08:02] <Cork> sure, just make the ul inline, and the smae with the li's
[22:08:07] <Cork> *same
[22:08:27] <nikaoli_> ok i'll try that now
[22:08:56] <nikaoli_> i thought i did before and they were rendering the standard top down way(the children items)
[22:09:04] <Cork> not though, space character has significance if you use inline element!
[22:11:33] <zilly> Are there any gotchas' with jQuery and IE?  I thought the whole purpose of jQuery was so that it worked with all the browsers.  I'm having several issues with only IE -- mainly with selecting anchors by the value of their href attribute.
[22:12:09] <coldhead> it generally does just work
[22:12:19] <danieliser> anybody tried yii?
[22:12:20] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewhere?
[22:12:25] <Cork> zilly: the only problem i know with ie and hrefs is that it presents the url differently twards the script
[22:12:25] <coldhead> ?p @ zilly
[22:12:25] <nikaoli_> thanks Cork , but now my padding is broken
[22:12:26] <bot-t> zilly, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:12:36] <nikaoli_> all this CSS is making me dizzy
[22:12:38] <Cork> nikaoli_: ya, see my comments
[22:12:42] <nikaoli_> o.O
[22:12:48] <Cork> "<Cork> not though, space character has significance if you use inline element!"
[22:13:01] <coldhead> oh that's right, IE converts relative URLs to absolute URLs
[22:13:05] <coldhead> thanks IE, take 5
[22:13:19] <nikaoli_> what do you mean by that cork?
[22:13:24] <Cork> nikaoli_: oh, if you want padding on the elements use inline-block instead of inline
[22:13:32] <nikaoli_> ohhhhhhh
[22:14:18] <nikaoli_> thanks again
[22:14:40] <nikaoli_> now the child items of "marks" have gone astray
[22:14:44] <dr0id> spanish chars not appearing properly in ckeditor, though they appear fine in textarea/html, what could be the problem ?
[22:14:45] <Cork> nikaoli_: inline or inline-block elements collaps but save spaces so ex. <li>something</li>\n  <li>else</li> becomes something else
[22:14:56] <zilly> bot-t: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/472845/
[22:14:58] <bot-t> zilly, Couldn't find "http://paste.pocoo.org/show/472845/" in jQuery Docs.
[22:15:02] <Cork> nikaoli_: compared to ex. floats that ignores space
[22:15:19] <nikaoli_> should i be putting inline-block also on li {}
[22:15:26] <nikaoli_> and should i remove "float:left" ?
[22:15:34] <Cork> yes
[22:15:56] <nikaoli_> i need to remember that, floats and inlines ignore spaces
[22:16:01] <zilly> cork, what do you mean that it presents the url differently toward the script?
[22:16:21] <Cork> nikaoli_: no no inlines doesn't ignore space, thats the difference :D
[22:16:44] <Cork> zilly: ie expands the url to absolute/full urls
[22:16:52] <Cork> so where ohttp://65.75.121.104:8888/motb/
[22:16:54] <Cork> opps
[22:17:06] <zilly> cork, so should I just add something to trim it in that script then?
[22:17:06] <Cork> zilly: or rather i think its the oposit
[22:17:40] <Cork> zilly: give me a min to check you pb
[22:17:47] <nikaoli_> inlines dont ignore margins and paddings?
[22:17:52] <nikaoli_> o.O
[22:17:58] <zilly> cork, ok, thanks.  I appreciate it.
[22:18:01] <Cork> nikaoli_: inlines can't have margin or padding
[22:18:11] <Cork> nikaoli_: floats can
[22:18:16] <nikaoli_> oh
[22:18:41] <nikaoli_> i'm almost there Cork
[22:18:47] <Cork> zilly: url is a relative or complete url?
[22:18:55] <Cork> doh!
[22:18:58] <zilly> Cork, relative.
[22:18:59] <Cork> you have it at the bottom
[22:19:44] <nikaoli_> do you know why the sub item of "marks" is not in line with the parents?
[22:20:25] <JohnnyDavidson> If I do something like
[22:20:35] <JohnnyDavidson> $('#divX *').bind();
[22:20:42] <JohnnyDavidson> and then I add another element to divX
[22:20:47] <JohnnyDavidson> will it also have the bind?
[22:20:51] <coldhead> ?live @ JohnnyDavidson
[22:20:52] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:20:58] <coldhead> no, you gotta use live()
[22:21:02] <coldhead> or delegate
[22:21:04] <JohnnyDavidson> What's the difference?
[22:21:13] <JohnnyDavidson> What's the use of using bind, instead of live I guess
[22:21:13] <coldhead> live works with the future
[22:21:17] <coldhead> bind works with the present
[22:21:22] <coldhead> bind is more "optimal"
[22:21:26] <JohnnyDavidson> Okay I guess
[22:21:27] <JohnnyDavidson> Thanks
[22:21:36] <coldhead> You're welcome I gues
[22:21:37] <coldhead> s
[22:21:47] <JohnnyDavidson> Works :)
[22:22:12] <coldhead> yay!
[22:22:33] <dr0id> coldhead: used ckeditor ?
[22:22:55] <Cork> zilly: it was ie6 you had problem with right?
[22:23:09] <zilly> cork, ie8 =[
[22:23:36] <zilly> cork, I'm putting up a browser upgrade for less than that.  I can't handle it =/
[22:23:37] <coldhead> dr0id: yes, but not in a long time
[22:23:37] <Cork> zilly: hmm
[22:23:39] <Cork> wfm http://jsfiddle.net/KmjbG/4/
[22:23:43] <coldhead> it made me sad
[22:24:45] <nikaoli_> fixed Cork , i had to remove the overflow:hidden line
[22:25:02] <Cork> heh
[22:25:08] <nikaoli_> thanks for your help cork, i'll head to #css to figure out this css stuff
[22:25:44] <nikaoli_> wait a minute
[22:26:16] <nikaoli_> .show() is still doing that bounce effect
[22:26:54] <shellox_> good morning
[22:26:58] <Cork> nikaoli_: your ul is still positioned ilegaly
[22:27:19] <nikaoli_> o.O
[22:27:25] <Cork> the structure should be <ul><li><a></a><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul>
[22:27:47] <Cork> ul is only allowed to contayn li's
[22:27:57] <Cork> *contain
[22:28:17] <shellox_> nikaoli_: better use a markup language which handle this for you :P
[22:28:56] * nikaoli_ points a broken bottle at shellox_  :P
[22:30:16] <coldhead> PUT DOWN THE CRUSTACEAN
[22:31:43] <dr0id> coldhead: why ?
[22:32:50] <coldhead> why did it make me sad?
[22:32:55] <dr0id> yep
[22:32:57] <coldhead> iframes and broken markup
[22:33:06] <coldhead> what you see is not really what you get
[22:33:07] <dr0id> so what do you use now ?
[22:33:11] <dr0id> heh
[22:33:12] <nikaoli_> i think my html is fixed now Cork , but im stilling getting the bouncing
[22:33:15] <coldhead> markdown
[22:33:23] <coldhead> and my intensive markdown training course
[22:33:25] <dr0id> wow, everyone seems to use markdown now
[22:33:32] <coldhead> oh god pasting word into ckeditor
[22:33:38] <coldhead> so many nightmares
[22:33:53] <tonyjcamp> ms-times-new-roman ftw
[22:34:30] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there anyway to remove <br> tags from a div?
[22:34:33] <JohnnyDavidson> I have a div with a bunch
[22:34:47] <dr0id> get a nice text editor
[22:35:33] <Cork> nikaoli_: i think that might be cause show sets display: block when it animates (might remembering wrong here though)
[22:36:03] <nikaoli_> i think you're right cork
[22:36:28] <nikaoli_> thats how i see it animate on the jquery demos also
[22:36:36] <nikaoli_> damn.......:(
[22:36:50] <Cork> nikaoli_: btw two side notes $("#myDialog").dialog(); <-- jquery-ui isn't loaded
[22:37:01] <Cork> and the logo at the top left links to localhost
[22:37:12] <nikaoli_> any alternative to do doing my slide out animation
[22:37:36] <nikaoli_> i've gotta remove that dialogue thing, i was testing it out. just started using jquery a few days ago
[22:37:59] <Cork> nikaoli_: i would prob do something like setting the ul sub menu to overflow:hidden; AND width: 0
[22:38:01] <nikaoli_> and the logo thing, i've gotta set my hrefs to $BASEURL, its a concrete5 thing
[22:38:07] <Cork> then animate it with animate() instead
[22:38:12] <Cork> that SHOULD work
[22:38:23] <Cork> can't think of a reason why it shouldn't
[22:38:31] <JohnnyDavidson> What selector would I use to select all id's with a name xy, y being a random number
[22:38:33] <nikaoli_> i kind of tried that before though cork
[22:38:39] <JohnnyDavidson> So like $('#x*') or something
[22:38:43] <nikaoli_> it crashes the code
[22:39:03] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone know?
[22:39:07] <nikaoli_> is there such a thing as width:100% of its transform
[22:39:09] <nikaoli_> ?
[22:39:15] <tonyjcamp> Just a heads up, if you have multiple elements, use classes.
[22:39:26] <coldhead> JohnnyDavidson: $('[id^="x"]')
[22:39:28] <nikaoli_> or does it try to stretch to the width of the page?
[22:39:30] <Cork> nikaoli_: width: auto
[22:39:40] <Cork> nikaoli_: but i'm not sure animate can handle that
[22:39:42] <JohnnyDavidson> What does that do coldhead?
[22:39:47] <nikaoli_> thanks cork
[22:39:53] * nikaoli_ testing
[22:39:57] <JohnnyDavidson> Does ^= mean includes?
[22:40:02] <coldhead> selects elements where the attribute ID starts with "x"
[22:40:08] <JohnnyDavidson> Oh okay
[22:40:15] <JohnnyDavidson> Thank you will try it
[22:40:20] <coldhead> read the docs on the selectors, 15 minutes well spent :)
[22:40:29] <tonyjcamp> For sure
[22:41:02] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: do those selectors kill performance?
[22:41:08] <tonyjcamp> ~=  and the like
[22:41:16] <JohnnyDavidson> Works, thanks coldhead again
[22:42:19] <coldhead> yeah, attribute selectors are slow
[22:42:31] <coldhead> far better to use something the browser supperts natively
[22:42:36] <coldhead> like ID or class
[22:42:46] <coldhead> but sometimes you gotta use what works
[22:42:54] <coldhead> and also see ?optimisation
[22:42:55] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[22:42:55] <tonyjcamp> yuppers
[22:43:06] <tonyjcamp> hahah
[22:43:45] <tonyjcamp> I've also heard optimize when you need it. Don't write optimized code from the start.
[22:45:32] <coldhead> same idea
[22:45:35] <nikaoli_> Cork: http://65.75.121.104:8888/motb/
[22:45:40] <nikaoli_> its gone bonjers
[22:45:41] <nikaoli_> bonkers
[22:46:26] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: are you headed to jQuery Conf?
[22:46:50] <coldhead> no sir
[22:47:01] <tonyjcamp> QQ
[22:50:59] <coldhead> i just thought we'd all be dead by now
[22:51:07] <bananasontoast> Is there a Sydney jQuery Conf?
[22:51:10] <coldhead> so there didn't seem any point in planning to attend conferences
[22:51:27] <bananasontoast> lol
[22:51:27] <bananasontoast> Oh, it's SF
[22:51:27] * bananasontoast is a dunce
[22:51:40] <bahodir> hi guys, can anybody tell me how I can change the text of a div and then show it. I'm looking for a chaned solution.
[22:52:07] <bahodir> something like $("div#a").text('b').show()
[22:52:22] <coldhead> what's wrong with that?
[22:52:26] <coldhead> looks pretty good
[22:52:28] <coldhead> CASE CLOSED
[22:52:44] <bahodir> firebug says it's not a function
[22:52:45] <Cork> nikaoli_: width: 'auto', not the other way around :)
[22:52:47] <bananasontoast> bahodir: $("div").html("content goes here").show();
[22:52:47] <bananasontoast> Or text, yah
[22:53:05] <bahodir> bananasontoast: it doesn't work
[22:53:22] <coldhead> no YOU don't work
[22:53:26] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:53:34] <nikaoli_> all values must have '' on them? or only the none numeric ones?
[22:53:36] <coldhead> maybe jquery is not loaded?
[22:53:51] <bananasontoast> bahodir: Have you included your jQuery script and put the statement inside a dockment.ready?
[22:53:52] <bahodir> oh it might be the text inside text() is empty
[22:53:58] <bahodir> yes jquery is included
[22:54:02] <bahodir> thanks for the idea
[22:54:11] <bananasontoast> Haha, that was a funny typo
[22:54:18] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to pause a bunch of code until after a .animate(); is complete?
[22:54:33] <nikaoli_> its still not working
[22:54:44] * nikaoli_ grabs gun and puts it in his mouth
[22:54:46] <JohnnyDavidson> Like .animate();x();y();z();
[22:54:47] <coldhead> bahodir: http://jsfiddle.net/zRYFd/
[22:54:53] <JohnnyDavidson> How do I make xyz wait until after
[22:54:59] <bahodir> coldhead: thanks
[22:55:26] <bananasontoast> What the fuck am I? Chopped liver?
[22:55:43] <bahodir> bananasontoast: thanks to you too
[22:56:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone?
[22:56:06] <bananasontoast> lol yw
[22:56:24] <JohnnyDavidson> I know you can do like animate().x, but is there a way to wrap a bunch of code like .animate().function(){ //code } or something
[22:56:26] <bananasontoast> coldhead: Best variable and text choices ever. Gold star.
[22:58:31] <nikaoli_> crap i was missing a curly bracket Cork
[22:59:24] <nikaoli_> auto definitely does not work
[22:59:31] <nikaoli_> i tried 500 and it works
[22:59:36] <Cork> you haven't fixed what i told you yet :)
[22:59:48] * nikaoli_ puts gun back in mouth
[22:59:48] <coldhead> yeah geez nikaoli_
[22:59:48] <Cork> auto isn't a javascript variable
[23:00:03] <nikaoli_> its 2am Cork  o.O  :)
[23:00:04] <Cork> nikaoli_: so it needs to be a string
[23:00:16] <Cork> nikaoli_: $('#marks-sub').stop().animate({width:auto}); => $('#marks-sub').stop().animate({width:'auto'});
[23:00:27] <nikaoli_> i put animate({'width':'auto'}) and no worky
[23:00:33] <Cork> ok
[23:00:54] <Cork> ok wait a min...
[23:01:05] <Cork> i saw a lot of other things before
[23:01:06] <zilly> Cork, do you know anything about IE needing time before you can attach an event to an element you just created?
[23:01:09] * Cork tests thouse again
[23:01:39] <nikaoli_> yeah i was randomly chaning stuff to ease my pain :P
[23:01:41] <Cork> zilly: nope that should work as soon as its added to the dom, and that should be sync
[23:02:11] <zilly> Cork, if I add an element and then attach something, it's not doing anything.  But, if it's already in the html, then it works fine.
[23:02:12] <Cork> ok the display: none is gone
[23:02:53] <Cork> zilly: i know it works if you do it in the order .append/.html then bind the event
[23:03:28] <Cork> nikaoli_: replace width:auto with width:'auto'
[23:03:33] <Cork> right now the js is broken
[23:03:35] <tonyjcamp> zilly: how are you attaching the event
[23:03:37] <nikaoli_> just did that, still doesnt work
[23:03:50] <zilly> tonyjcamp, with the id of the elemnt.
[23:04:00] <Cork> nikaoli_: might be so, but right now i can't test anything as the js just throws errors
[23:04:14] <tonyjcamp> sorry, I mean .click .live .delegate  etc
[23:04:15] * nikaoli_ pulls trigger
[23:04:23] * nikaoli_ brain juice all over the walls
[23:04:32] <Cork> ...
[23:04:44] * Cork goes and does something more constructive with his time...
[23:05:09] <nikaoli_> do you think its  a jquery limitation?
[23:05:28] <Cork> no
[23:06:30] <JohnnyDavidson> Hmm
[23:06:32] <nikaoli_> but it work when i use a number instead of auto
[23:06:35] <JohnnyDavidson> padding is screwing up my animations
[23:06:38] <JohnnyDavidson> Any way around this?
[23:07:14] <JohnnyDavidson> Like I have 15px of padding, so when my animation starts, it jumps back 15px
[23:07:17] <JohnnyDavidson> And it looks super glitchy
[23:07:55] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone?
[23:08:16] <Todd_LEFTART> wrapper it with another div, and animate the wrapper?
[23:08:36] <Todd_LEFTART> wrap it ...
[23:08:43] <JohnnyDavidson> What do you mean?
[23:09:02] <nikaoli_> Cork:  cya later thats enough jquery for me its 2:08am time to finish my other project :(
[23:09:07] <JohnnyDavidson> Wouldn't that defeat the point of animating it?
[23:09:24] <coldhead> good luck with that mouth gun thing, nikaoli_
[23:09:34] <nikaoli_> lol
[23:09:48] <JohnnyDavidson> If I wrap it with a div, a div is invisible, and animating it would do nothing
[23:10:00] <nikaoli_> if i only had a real gun........i'd be in sweet painless, codeless heaven right now
[23:21:49] <Todd_LEFTART> are you still struggling with your menu, nikaoli?
[23:43:55] <balr0g> hello, how to know the members/structure of an object passed to a callback event function? what to use? is there some var_dump()? how to watch?
[23:49:53] <TheCode> console.log(object);
[23:50:08] <balr0g> TheCode, checking
[23:51:48] <thapelo> howzit guys
[23:52:46] <thapelo> I need some help with some jquery on IE
[23:56:47] <misterm> thapelo: if you have a question or something just go ahead and ask
[23:58:14] <bananasontoast> I am currently using the jQuery UI tooltip() function from the jQuery UI Guthub - can anyone tell me if there is a way to make it open on load?
