[00:00:11] <Cork> the api said you can use widget if you need the raw widget element
[00:00:25] <Cork> s/said/says/
[00:00:30] <Bauer1> ti says: Returns a jQuery object containing the slider
[00:00:36] <Cork> exactly
[00:00:52] <Cork> <containing>
[00:01:04] <Bauer1> isnt that what  var slider = $( "#slider" );? does?
[00:01:11] <Cork> no it gives you the slider
[00:01:28] <Bauer1> I fail to see the difference...
[00:01:51] <Bauer1> jquery selector returns a jquery object, no?
[00:02:00] <Cork> basically <ui-widget>('widget') is only needed/used when you need to hack the widget
[00:10:23] <Bauer1> Cork: in actual code (not in fiddle), on line slider.on("slidechange slide", function( event) { I get error Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on'  - could it be because of Jquery 1.3?
[00:10:40] <Cork> yes
[00:10:46] <Cork> you would have to use bind there
[00:13:06] <Bauer1> thanks, bind works :)
[00:29:03] <joroci> is there an issue with internet explorer and jquery.on custom events?
[00:30:30] <Cork> joroci: not that i know of
[00:31:11] <joroci> weird... it's working on chrome but ie fails
[00:31:26] <joroci> as usual
[00:31:36] <Cork> make sure you don't have an extra comma or something
[00:31:43] <Cork> ie likes to choke on those
[00:32:24] <joroci> i'll paste the code tell me if you see something wrong
[00:34:42] <joroci> http://jsfiddle.net/4TW4z
[00:35:12] <Cork> what ie version are you having problem with?
[00:35:18] <joroci> 11
[00:35:35] <joroci> 10
[00:35:50] <Cork> heh what? collection = collection.not('*')??
[00:36:12] <Cork> could you add the needed html and the like to make it work?
[00:36:18] <joroci> not my code i'm just trying to fix
[00:36:45] <Cork> but ya, i don't see anything that jumps out at me
[00:37:05] <joroci> it's kinda complicated
[00:37:20] <joroci> but there is no error
[00:37:46] <Cork> put some debug code in it and see where it fails then
[00:39:00] <Bauer1> Cork: I have a problem on line 25: http://jsfiddle.net/bt6fz/5/ in the actual code, when I debug it, variable i = 1 although it should be 0, and I cant figure out why.. in that case there is only one object in OptionalResources array, so the .bind should be working with i=0 and not 1
[00:39:10] <joroci> yea i'm trying
[00:39:18] <joroci> it's just the events aren't triggered
[00:40:37] <Cork> hmm
[00:41:41] <Cork> joroci: is the dragenter event firing?
[00:45:13] <Bauer1> Cork, any idea with the problem on line 25?
[00:47:12] <Cork> Bauer1: that code never runs so...
[00:49:31] <jaypitidi> How can i redirect to a page with ajax post data?
[00:49:42] <Cork> you can't
[00:49:50] <Cork> ajax can't redirect
[00:49:57] <Cork> you can do a post and then a get
[00:50:08] <Cork> or you can build a normal form and post it
[00:51:04] <Bauer1> Cork: you can see the code working here: https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=mail# if you click on one product, and try to scroll the slider, you will see the error. the code here is minified however, but debugging shows that i = 1 and not 0, and that is why it fails, question is why is it 1 and not 0 inside the clear copy of the function in jsfiddle
[00:51:40] <Bauer1> and pls not a word about the design, I know.. its terrible - not my responsibility :P
[00:51:53] <jaypitidi> well i tried to post using submit() inside each() but it only posted one form
[00:54:55] <Bauer1> Cork: see the error now?
[00:55:08] <Cork> i'm not going to debug minified js, sorry
[00:55:26] <Bauer1> ok.. let me try port the relevant parts to jsfiddle :(
[01:01:28] <Bauer1> Cork: well jsfiddle gives error about blocked frame with origin.. perhaps that is why its not working? http://jsfiddle.net/bt6fz/8/
[01:03:12] <joroci> burn in in hell
[01:03:14] <joroci> ie*
[01:07:06] <Cork> Bauer1: you don't have any 26858 element in the page
[01:07:10] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/bt6fz/9/show/
[01:08:28] <Bauer1> Cork: sorry, my mistake the element should have been the resource ID :) here: http://fiddle.jshell.net/bt6fz/10/
[01:08:35] <Bauer1> move the slider, and you see the error
[01:09:18] <Cork> ah
[01:09:39] <Cork> Bauer1: you arn't storing the instance of the i variable
[01:10:42] <Bauer1> Cork: what do you mean by "storing" it? I assign the event on the .on, at that time i is 0.. I am not sure where I am supposed to store it. what if there would be 2 sliders? each .on event should exist with its own value of i
[01:13:57] <Cork> Bauer1: http://fiddle.jshell.net/bt6fz/11/
[01:14:51] <Cork> opps sorry my error
[01:15:18] <Cork> Bauer1: http://fiddle.jshell.net/bt6fz/12/
[01:21:32] <Cork> Bauer1: in the event callback you used i from the for loop
[01:21:50] <Cork> Bauer1: for loops isn't scoped, so you don't get a frozen value for the i
[01:22:03] <Cork> so when the callback fires they will all have the last value the i has
[01:22:26] <Cork> and that is Item.OptionalResources.length
[01:24:04] <joroci> visual studio 2013 stinks
[01:34:04] <Bauer1> Cork: sorry had someone here.. what is your solution in revision 12? you removed the line which updates the global slider's value...
[01:35:00] <Cork> Bauer1: well no
[01:35:12] <Cork> i changed it to use the variable you already had
[01:35:31] <Cork> Bauer1: and the answers to why your solution failed is in here

[01:39:11] <bungalo> hi guys
[01:41:36] <bungalo> i am using foundation4 with jquery 1.10.2 and need to use something like live('click' - now ie8 is throwing errorsâ€¦.. but if i change it to a click(function it wont work for divs that are added dynamically
[01:41:40] <bungalo> what can i do?
[01:43:03] <Bauer1> Cork: you changed for .each (which I am not sure will work in jquery 1.3), and also - where do you store the updated item? I had window.SelectedItem, but where do you store it?
[01:45:00] <Bauer1> Cork: I need to be able to access the SelectedPlan object from another function, after customer finishes customizing and clicks next.. so it has to be in global scope
[01:47:07] <Bauer1> and what is var CurrentSlider = this;? I dont understand
[01:52:35] <seutje> Bauer1: it's a reference to the object currently being looped over, scoped so that the event handler accesses the right element as CurrentSlider
[01:53:57] <Bauer1> ahhhh thats nice :) but how do I access it from outside the scope? to see what was the FinalValue?
[01:57:58] <seutje> Bauer1: u don't need to, it's inherently Item.OptionalResources[Item.OptionalResources.length -1]
[01:58:41] <seutje> but I suppose you could create a variable outside the .each() and set it from within it
[01:58:53] <Bauer1> seutje: no, I need to access the item OUTSIDE DisplayConfigSliders
[01:59:23] <seutje> so create it outside there
[02:00:25] <seutje> still, it'll be window.SelectedPlan.OptionalResources[window.SelectedPlan.OptionalResources.length -1]
[02:01:24] <Bauer1> seutje: how would that work? if I'd have 2 sliders (2 array elements for OptionalResources)? this solution with -1 wouldnt work
[02:01:44] <seutje> what?
[02:01:47] <Bauer1> both sliders would be updating elemnt 0 in the array
[02:01:59] <seutje> if you have only one, it'd be [0]
[02:02:17] <Bauer1> yes in this example, but if I have 2 optional resources? (meaning I generate 2 sliders)
[02:02:29] <seutje> the last is the last is the last
[02:02:49] <Bauer1> what? hehe
[02:02:56] <seutje> if you have 17, you'll get the 17th
[02:03:04] <seutje> that's what last means, right?
[02:03:27] <seutje> or do u just want a reference to what it was last run on?
[02:05:17] <Bauer1> seutje: ok a little back: if SelectedPlan has optional resource(s), I display the slider(s) corresponding to it. Then I do a .bind event to update the window.SelectedPlan and the slider(s)'s value with what the user selected (so later on, another function can access the SelectedPlan, and KNOW what values to POST
[02:06:08] <Bauer1> my problem is, that inside the .bind, I cant say window.SelectedPlan.OptionalResources[i] because i changes and on event triggering, i is equal to len and not 0 for example
[02:06:39] <seutje> wouldn't u need to post all the optional resources?
[02:06:47] <Bauer1> hence the solution Cork suggested, but I fail to see how it updates the window.SelectedPlan.OptionalResources[0] (or 1) for example.. so another function can access it
[02:07:07] <seutje> it just passes a reference around
[02:07:16] <Cork> Bauer1: you already have a variable pointing there
[02:07:26] <Cork> so if you change that value it would just be updated
[02:07:34] <seutje> Item in DisplayConfigSliders === window.SelectedPlan
[02:07:39] <Cork> CurrentPlan is the [i] ones
[02:07:43] <Cork> *one
[02:16:50] <raj> I have a .dialog() form. When I click enter to submit it, another form on the page also submits. Any ideas?
[02:17:20] <Cork> raj: sounds like you might have a selector that matches more then it should
[02:17:35] <Cork> like $('form').submit() or something
[02:17:59] <Cork> from ex a .keyup event for example
[02:18:32] <raj> It isn't, I've just created the element, and bound an event to it
[02:18:44] <Cork> the event might be on document
[02:18:44] <raj> before even moving it to the DOM
[02:19:08] <Cork> you can't fire events on elements that isn't in the dom
[02:19:57] <raj> I move it into the DOM before firing it
[02:20:04] <raj> (via click)
[02:20:20] <Cork> click?
[02:20:22] <raj> only when I hit ENTER in the dialog's form does the other form submit
[02:20:35] <raj> clicking SUBMIT, doesn't have this issue
[02:20:52] <Cork> ya, so like i said check so you don't have an event listener that listens for the keyup event
[02:21:20] <raj> oh wow
[02:21:22] <raj> that's exactly it
[02:21:28] <raj> thank you!
[02:22:32] <raj> ok, I shoulda tested before saying that
[02:29:15] <raj> ahh, I see what the problem is
[02:30:02] <raj> the .dialog() submits on keydown, but the other form (which rightfully retains focus) submits on keyup
[02:31:06] <Cork> raj: why don't you just bind the submit event on the form instead?
[02:31:15] <Cork> then you wouldn't have this problem at all
[02:33:46] <raj> Cork, each submit event is on its respective form
[02:34:07] <Cork> then why is keyup/keydown a factor at all?
[02:34:39] <raj> oh, no it wasn't
[02:35:01] <raj> I had duplicate functions
[02:35:03] <raj> sorry about that
[02:35:12] <Serdar> I got a stupid question
[02:35:55] <Serdar> if I got <div id="123">... what is the difference of $("#123") $("123") and $(".123")
[02:36:45] <raj> Serdar, $("123") won't work. # selects an ID of a particular name (in your case 123), and . selects a class of that name
[02:37:30] <Serdar> raj, then $("body") should also not work right?
[02:38:50] <Cork> Serdar: $("#123") id;  $("123") element name;  $(".123") class
[02:39:10] <Cork> Serdar: it follow the same select rules that css uses
[02:39:27] <Serdar> I wanted to create a new div var div_popup = $(['<div id="' + ticket.ID + '" title="'+ ticket.ID +'">', ...].join('')); $("body").append(div_popup)
[02:39:44] <Cork> should work
[02:39:48] <Serdar> ah, then $("body") is correct
[02:39:51] <Cork> yes
[02:40:35] <Serdar> hmm my dialog worked before I changed to this: $( "#" + ticket.ID ).dialog({... I guess I am missing some quotes right?
[02:40:46] <Cork> no
[02:40:47] <Serdar> should I use '' isntead of ""
[02:40:51] <Serdar> hmm
[02:40:52] <Cork> doens't matter
[02:41:02] <Cork> make sure the id exist though
[02:41:17] <Cork> console.log(( "#" + ticket.ID ), $( "#" + ticket.ID ).length)
[02:41:22] <Cork> opps
[02:41:28] <Cork> console.log("#" + ticket.ID, $( "#" + ticket.ID ).length)
[02:42:26] <Serdar> I made console.log(ticket) and it looked right, but let me try this way
[02:44:23] <raj> Serdar, `body` is an html tag, just like `p`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, etc
[02:44:28] <raj> so those will all work
[02:45:19] <Serdar> this makes me nuts, I see with my log object Object in firefox and if I clock on it I see ticket expanded with: ID: "123456"
[02:45:29] <Serdar> but with what you wrote I see #undefiend
[02:45:39] <Serdar> undefined
[02:45:51] <Cork> Serdar: jsfiddle it
[02:46:01] <Serdar> raj, yeah I got that
[02:46:55] <raj> Serdar, if you check out http://jsfiddle.net , we can see exactly what you do
[02:47:26] <raj> hmm Cork, keeps beating me to the punch
[02:51:00] <alex88> hi guys, looking at http://api.jqueryui.com/show/ in the function with multiple arguments I can pass effect specific options, to do the same passing the options hash?
[02:52:10] <Serdar> I don't see anything, that's odd
[02:53:13] <Cork> alex88: if the question is if you can use an object to say it instead of arguments; then yes
[02:53:40] <Serdar> http://jsfiddle.net/FFMz5/1/
[02:54:00] <Serdar> I expected any output like undefined
[02:54:12] <alex88> Cork: but the object specifies effect, easing, duration, complete and queue, if I want for example to pass direction since the effect is slide?
[02:54:28] <Cork> Serdar: line 10
[02:54:31] <alex88> maybe I should pass it directly along the other ones
[02:54:36] <Cork> there is a linebreak in your string
[02:55:51] <Cork> alex88: i think you set direction in the options
[02:56:01] <Cork> though i haven't used the effects from jquery ui much
[02:56:12] <alex88> Cork: you're right, sorry for the idiot question :)
[02:56:24] <Serdar> Cork, removing that didn't change a thing. there is still no output
[02:56:25] <Cork> alex88: it wasn't
[02:57:17] <Serdar> I guess popupTicket didn't call properly
[02:59:10] <Cork> Serdar: http://jsfiddle.net/FFMz5/5/
[02:59:16] <Cork> though there is no html so no id to find
[03:00:43] <Serdar> but it is there after I append it
[03:01:00] <alex88> is possible to do a slideDown of an element showing from bottom to top instead of top to bottom, like it's scrolling from top?
[03:01:48] <Serdar> but the issue is, that if I do console.log(ticket) I get the whole ticket shown, but if I do console.log('#'+ticket.ID..) like you said I get undefined
[03:06:53] <Serdar> I don't get it
[03:06:54] <Cork> Serdar: http://jsfiddle.net/FFMz5/6/
[03:06:58] <Cork> works fine here
[03:08:52] <Serdar> did you change something?
[03:09:08] <Cork> just moved the console.log lines
[03:09:13] <Serdar> it works with my firefox
[03:09:24] <Serdar> but not with IE
[03:09:25] <Cork> and removed the option to not open it by default
[03:09:39] <Cork> it most likely crashes on the console.log lines
[03:10:19] <Serdar> can you explain me why this happens?
[03:10:30] <Serdar> I don't get this
[03:10:48] <Cork> console.log crashes in ie if you don't have the developer tools open
[03:10:57] <alex88> IE when not in developer mode doesn't have window.console
[03:10:57] <Cork> cause it doesn't define the object unless you do that
[03:11:22] <Serdar> if I do console.log(ticket); I can see the information in firefox but it is undefined if I use it for .ID
[03:11:48] <Serdar> no I used IE only for jsfiddle, but I tested it on firefox the whole time.
[03:11:55] <Cork> Serdar: in http://jsfiddle.net/FFMz5/6/ ?
[03:11:58] <Cork> works fine here
[03:12:40] <Cork> though you are defining t in a risky order
[03:12:49] <Cork> cause you are defining ready before the variable
[03:14:41] <Serdar> Cork, this was only for fiddler, I don't use ready in my code. But what I still don't get is, why I see in Firefox for the two log commands once the object but an undefined parameter ID which is visible?
[03:15:30] <Cork> where do you see this?
[03:15:34] <Cork> i don't
[03:15:48] <Cork> "#123456" 1 <--
[03:20:55] <Serdar> I don't understand it. I copied this to my code and I stil lget undefined.
[03:21:30] <Cork> Serdar: the problem is most likely how you define the object you send to the function
[03:22:32] <joroci> i found the problem Cork
[03:23:30] <Serdar> Cork, I made a console.log(ticket); and after clicking on the object in Firefox I can see that the object is filled exactly like I posted in fiddler
[03:23:56] <Cork> Serdar: and ticket.ID is undefined?
[03:24:08] <Serdar> no I can see there 123456
[03:24:14] <Cork> ok?
[03:24:19] <Cork> then what is the problem?
[03:24:34] <Serdar> if I use ticket.ID I get undefined
[03:24:44] <Cork> uh... you just said it wasn't
[03:24:52] <Serdar> this driving me nuts
[03:25:05] <Serdar> Cork, yes that's why it drives me nuts
[03:25:07] <Cork> Serdar: try console.log(Object.keys(ticket)
[03:25:10] <Cork> Serdar: * try console.log(Object.keys(ticket))
[03:25:21] <Cork> i suspect you have a space in the key or something like that
[03:26:20] <Cork> Serdar: no i meant "Serdar: and ticket.ID is undefined?"; "no I can see there 123456"; "ticket.ID I get undefined"
[03:26:26] <Cork> you kinda contradict your self there :)
[03:26:43] <Serdar> hmm there are only 2 parameter
[03:26:55] <Cork> copy the array and show it
[03:27:42] <Serdar> [12:25:45.495] [object Array]
[03:27:44] <Cork> console.log(JSON.strinfify(Object.keys(ticket))) should do that
[03:27:45] <Serdar> no wait
[03:27:50] <Serdar> ah
[03:28:14] <Cork> and if it is long, don't post it in the channel
[03:29:48] <Serdar> [12:29:19.565] "["type","ticket"]"
[03:30:07] <Cork> then you don't have an ID there
[03:30:17] <Cork> or is it inside ticket?
[03:30:18] <Serdar> but if I use JSON.stringify on ticket I see ID there
[03:30:22] <Cork> ticket.ticket.ID ?
[03:31:11] <Serdar> uh, when did this happen
[03:31:21] <Cork> i take that as a yes :)
[03:31:36] <Serdar> I mean I didn't expect ticket there
[03:31:53] <Cork> ya, so don't expect things check what the data says
[03:32:15] <Serdar> fsck, when did this happen.. grml I hate it.
[03:34:07] <Serdar> thank you, I didn't see this comming
[03:34:17] <Cork> :)
[03:34:19] <Cork> np
[03:35:37] <Serdar> aaaah
[03:35:42] <Serdar> my fault
[03:35:57] <Serdar> I am an idiot, it was how I call my function...
[03:37:02] <Serdar> sure it is in ticket, I was only should have called my popup different :O
[03:37:57] <Serdar> hell, getting 4h of sleep is too less I guess
[03:38:59] <fuchstronaut> you are not doing enough cocain
[03:39:31] <Serdar> I couldn't tell my daughter enough that 3 am is not playtime
[03:40:15] <fuchstronaut> you see, cocain for you, valium for her, happy family picture
[03:40:26] <Cork> o_O
[03:41:58] <Serdar> I think not
[03:43:10] <felixjet> does this have a name? http://i.stack.imgur.com/6j93s.png
[03:43:30] <Cork> "this"?
[03:43:35] <Cork> a form?
[03:43:40] <felixjet> for example if you want to search plugins that makes that
[03:43:45] <felixjet> how you would search it?
[03:43:54] <Cork> are you talking about a query builder?
[03:44:05] <felixjet> no
[03:44:36] <felixjet> for example if you want a <select> with autocomplete, you search for "select autocomplete jquery"
[03:44:50] <felixjet> but how to find plugins/resources that makes that?
[03:44:59] <felixjet> i cant think on any words xD
[03:45:04] <fuchstronaut> dropdown?
[03:45:11] <felixjet> the entire thing
[03:45:22] <felixjet> something like auto adding divs
[03:45:24] <fuchstronaut> dropdown autocomplete is what i can thing of
[03:45:30] <felixjet> but that actually would give results
[03:46:13] <Serdar> fieldset?
[03:47:00] <felixjet> u.u
[03:47:12] <fuchstronaut> guess you will have to google more than once
[03:47:17] <felixjet> so if you want to search for a plugin that makes auto adding/removing layers
[03:47:23] <felixjet> you go google and search "fieldset" ?
[03:47:24] <felixjet> really?
[03:47:25] <felixjet> xD
[03:49:12] <fuchstronaut> If you are looking for sometihng to add a line or a tablerow, I think you will be better of writing 5 lines of code instead of searching for a plugin
[03:49:51] <felixjet> i just want resources
[03:50:11] <felixjet> by searching for a plugin i can see how others do it, and maybe implement something that now i dont know it exists
[03:50:21] <felixjet> sounds like "copy", but no xD

[03:56:03] <sasmit87> can somebody make me understand this http://jsfiddle.net/aaseL/
[03:58:53] <shoky> sasmit87: answered your q on #javascript
[03:59:56] <sasmit87> yeah thanks shoky :)
[04:00:05] <sasmit87> I am looking onto it there
[04:02:26] <Cork> sasmit87: basically you return a function with access to a scope
[04:02:41] <Cork> but ya ##javascript
[04:38:14] <oxsav> hello
[04:39:01] <oxsav> I'm trying to use jquery to do an GET operation to a simple rest API : http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tools/http-interfaces/
[04:39:27] <Cork> $.get(url, function(data) {});
[04:39:30] <oxsav> I have this example
[04:39:31] <oxsav> http://jsfiddle.net/W54qR/
[04:39:50] <Cork> ah, jsonp
[04:39:54] <oxsav> and it returns me Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain
[04:40:27] <oxsav> Cork should be json
[04:40:35] <Cork> oxsav: then the api is broken
[04:40:38] <oxsav> but it returns me allways the same error
[04:41:07] <Cork> if it should give you jsonp it should be application/javascript or text/javascript
[04:41:38] <Cork> if it actually gives you json the mimetype is still wrong
[04:42:35] <oxsav> Cork it seems that the problem is from the jquery side
[04:42:36] <oxsav> ..
[04:42:59] <Cork> oxsav: well firstly is the api on the same domain as your current website?
[04:44:33] <oxsav> Cork not
[04:44:42] <Cork> ok so plain json is out
[04:44:50] <Cork> does the server work with jsonp?
[04:45:04] <Cork> or does it provide origin support?
[04:46:13] <oxsav> Cork yep I think so ..
[04:46:40] <oxsav> most of the things I do with json
[04:46:43] <oxsav> so I think so
[04:47:14] <Cork> about which one?
[04:48:07] <Cork> does it support origin?
[04:48:17] <Cork> (for your domain)
[04:48:46] <oxsav> Cork yep it supports it
[04:48:52] <Cork> "it"?
[04:49:04] <oxsav> origin
[04:49:18] <oxsav> and jsonp
[04:50:25] <Cork> jsonp would work with what you have
[04:50:48] <Cork> try $.ajax(url, { type: 'get', crossDomain: true }).done(function(data) {});
[04:59:09] <walidvb> hi guys, i stumbled upon a jquery plugin that detected what was behind a div, and added a class corresponding to whether that background was dark or light, allowing for css'ing the div accordingly. extremely useful, but i can't find it anymore
[05:01:03] <oxsav> Cork: sry chrome crushed
[05:01:27] <oxsav> now it's giving me Origin url is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[05:01:31] <xnotte> how can i make an image with selectable (clickable) areas ?  I want to select areas of a body chart image
[05:01:58] <Cork> oxsav: ok, so plain json and cors json is out
[05:02:06] <Cork> oxsav: and from what you said before jsonp is out
[05:02:20] <Cork> so doens't sound like you can connect to the server from your site
[05:02:33] <oxsav> hmm
[05:02:39] <oxsav> and if it jsonp is not out?
[05:02:47] <oxsav> what difference could it make?
[05:02:59] <Cork> oxsav: your orifinal code would work
[05:03:07] <oxsav> hmm ok
[05:03:13] <Cork> *original
[05:03:22] <oxsav> in the afternoon I will try it in another machine
[05:03:30] <oxsav> And give you some feedback
[05:03:42] <oxsav> thank you for all
[05:05:33] <_pingu> can somebody recommend an advanced jquery statusbar plugin?
[05:12:56] <interop_madness> i've got an error where an event handler registered with .on(eventName) is triggered twice, but the first time the breakpoint is not hit and neither can a breakpoint at the corresponding .trigger(eventname) be hit the first time.
[05:13:52] <interop_madness> this completely eludes me. i thought javascript was single threaded. i place a breakpoint in the event handler, i expect it is hit every single time, without exception, when the event handler is invoked.
[05:14:06] <joroci> how do you capture dragend event with jquery?
[05:14:55] <interop_madness> this is actually a good hint...
[05:15:15] <interop_madness> because the event is triggered on selection change of a gridview which allows multiselect
[05:15:32] <interop_madness> so selection can be either by clicking on a single item or by dragging across a range of them
[05:15:43] <interop_madness> probably internally clicking invokes dragend
[05:15:51] <joroci> i didn't see your question
[05:15:56] <joroci> i'm just having trouble with this
[05:16:06] <interop_madness> can i see the original event in jquery?
[05:16:09] <joroci> :) but it's good it helped
[05:20:24] <Cork> interop_madness: original event object you mean?
[05:20:59] <interop_madness> for every .on(eventName) handler to be invoked, a .trigger(eventName) must have been called: true?
[05:21:08] <Cork> no
[05:21:10] <interop_madness> Cork, skip the question, dragend was not the culprit
[05:21:28] <Cork> trigger is needed for faked events
[05:21:32] <joroci> Cork
[05:21:42] <joroci> do you know why the event dragend doesn't work?
[05:22:28] <Cork> joroci: did you end the drag in the element you bound the event listener on?
[05:23:02] <interop_madness> Cork,  in my event handler, i have a window.confirm(). i place a breakpoint there and invoke the code. the first time i move the mouse, the confirm() dialog appears without the breakpoint being hit. how (theoretically) can this come to be?
[05:23:11] <jost> In jquery mobile, I want to check if an input is being edited by a user, similar to the focus-event on desktop. Is there something equivalent in jquery mobile?
[05:23:42] <joroci> well
[05:23:46] <interop_madness> the event is invoked two times, and it doesn't seem to be a bug in firebug, as it can be reproduced with IE
[05:23:47] <Cork> interop_madness: is the breakpoint before of after the confirm?
[05:23:49] <joroci> the element is window
[05:23:51] <joroci> so yea
[05:24:15] <interop_madness> Cork, same line as confirm an it is hit the second time the handler is invoked
[05:24:39] <Cork> interop_madness: sounds like a unreliable debugger
[05:24:39] <interop_madness> to be precise i cant place a breakpoint *anywhere* along the event path, it is *never* hit the first time
[05:24:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> morning joroci
[05:24:58] <Cork> interop_madness: though confirm and alert is scare cause they pause the js execution
[05:25:10] <interop_madness> it seems there are two threads in the javascript runtime of the browser, one of which is the debugger thread, the other of which is there simply out of spite
[05:25:15] <Cork> and events needs to be restarted and things like that after them
[05:25:34] <Cork> interop_madness: so i would recommend trying to remove the confirm and run with console.log and see if that makes a difference
[05:25:46] <joroci> hey rohan
[05:26:41] <interop_madness> Cork, my task is: cancel a selection change event of a listview if there are unsaved changes
[05:27:14] <interop_madness> more precisely, prompt the user if they want to discard the changes, and only if yes, continue the selection change event
[05:27:20] <Cork> interop_madness: so cancel it if it is and re-fire the event if you need to
[05:27:27] <Cork> and use an async dialog
[05:28:07] <interop_madness> Cork, by async dialog you mean a custom UI?
[05:28:11] <Cork> yes
[05:28:22] <interop_madness> ok, probably a good idea...
[05:28:26] <Cork> interop_madness: that is try if the confirm is the cause of the problem
[05:28:36] <Cork> if it is; move to use ex. the jquery ui dialog
[05:29:00] <Cork> alert, confirm and eval is considered bad for a reason :)
[05:29:43] <interop_madness> Cork, sure enough, confirm() was the culprit :(
[05:29:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: whats cooking
[05:30:05] <Cork> interop_madness: ya, event respin for the win
[05:31:06] <interop_madness> is... this... why people call javascript fundamentally, irreparably broken?
[05:31:18] <Cork> no
[05:31:25] <interop_madness> because this sounds like the most horrible idea ever
[05:31:29] <Cork> this is why ppl say don't use dom0 features
[05:31:56] <Cork> those are document.write, window.open, alert, confirm and event attributes
[05:32:06] <Cork> (and some more)
[05:32:22] <interop_madness> don't use them at all or don't use them inside event handlers?
[05:32:36] <Cork> interop_madness: mainly at all
[05:32:40] <interop_madness> heh
[05:32:44] <Cork> there are some rare exceptions
[05:32:58] <Cork> but you almost always get pain if you use them
[05:33:19] <Cork> document.write should just be removed all togeter if you ask me
[05:33:41] <interop_madness> is there some resource which elaborates your position in depth? because i suppose *now* is the time i wanna know this exactly, as we are about to implement a full rich client based entirely on javascript...
[05:33:42] <Cork> window.open is locked down heavily by popup blockers
[05:33:54] <joroci> i get it now
[05:33:59] <Cork> alert and confirm pauses the js execution and causes big problem; mainly with events
[05:34:10] <joroci> there is now dragend for dragging files from the OS
[05:34:13] <joroci> no*
[05:34:19] <interop_madness> i see
[05:34:20] <Cork> attribute events work really bad if you want the script to work without having to know about each other
[05:34:48] <interop_madness> but document.write is not used inside $(...).append()?
[05:34:53] <Cork> no
[05:35:06] <Cork> that is appendChild or innerHTML
[05:35:14] <Cork> depending on what you send to append
[05:35:25] <interop_madness> ok event attributes i don't use
[05:35:26] <Cork> oh sorry
[05:35:30] <Cork> it is always appendChild
[05:35:35] <Cork> innerHTML is html()
[05:35:50] <interop_madness> is there a list of dom0 features?
[05:35:56] <Cork> ?g mdn dom0
[05:35:56] <b-ot> Cork: DOM Implementation and Scriptability | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM_Implementation_and_Scriptability
[05:36:07] <Cork> interop_madness: not sure
[05:36:12] <interop_madness> thanks a lot Cork this was very insightful
[05:36:14] <Cork> i've been around since dom0 so... :)
[05:56:01] <amitev> hi all. i'm using jquery ui autocomplete. i have to create some kind of hierarchy in it (have an indentation spacing in the items). however the autocomplete widget trims my whitespaces. is there a way to make it not to do that?
[05:58:12] <Cork> amitev: that is most likely the standard space collapse in html
[05:58:26] <Cork> you could try adding white-space: pre; to the element
[05:59:40] <amitev> Cork: thx
[06:08:22] <xnotte> how can i make an image with selectable (clickable) areas ?  I want to select areas of a body chart image
[06:08:49] <Cork> xnotte: svg, or split the image up into sections
[06:08:57] <Cork> or you could use the old map tag
[06:09:22] <Cork> i would prob go with svg my self
[06:10:07] <xnotte> cork ok thanks, i'll check it out
[06:19:30] <ninjashogun> hi.  anyone have sound experience in JS?  specifically, we'd like to record from mic.
[06:21:28] <Cork> ?mdn getUserMedia
[06:21:29] <b-ot> Cork: Navigator.getUserMedia - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.getUserMedia
[06:21:44] <Cork> ninjashogun: though this is VERY new features so the support is limited
[06:22:02] <ninjashogun> yes - I was reading this!  i.e. that Chrome doesn't even enable this by default or something?
[06:22:10] <ninjashogun> Isn't there some other way?  Like, recording via Flash?
[06:22:24] <Cork> sure
[06:22:27] <Cork> you can use plugins
[06:22:37] <Cork> never done that though
[06:22:44] <ninjashogun> do you think, in practice, I can use Navigator.getUserMedia to record a wav file stored locally, from the mic?  Will this ACTUALLY work?
[06:23:06] <Cork> you don't record files
[06:23:13] <Cork> you actually grab the stream
[06:23:57] <Cork> but ya it should work ok as long as you use the prefixed commands
[06:24:08] <Cork> and as long as you don't need ie support :)
[06:24:33] <Cork> getUserMedia was added for the webrtc
[06:24:39] <ninjashogun> Cork, sorry - I'm just a beginner.  Is there any chance you could pastebin a very minimal example?
[06:24:48] <ninjashogun> Cork that would work and store a local recording
[06:24:55] <Cork> ninjashogun: there is an example in that page
[06:24:56] <ninjashogun> if it's pseudocode that doesn't actually work I guess it's okay
[06:25:32] <ninjashogun> Cork - right, but that's a stream, right?  It doesn't save it in a wav file or anything?
[06:25:55] <Cork> well you would have to grab it and then well send it to a server i guess
[06:26:06] <Cork> storing locally isn't really something websites are allowed
[06:26:17] <Cork> you could generate download blobs
[06:26:25] <Cork> and have the user store that i guess
[06:26:31] <ninjashogun> Cork - I didn't mean actually store it (save to disk).  I just meant save it in a variable or something so I could use it locally.
[06:26:45] <ninjashogun> Cork - I just want it to be in local cache so I could play it back or do other things with it
[06:26:46] <Cork> the example does that
[06:28:01] <ninjashogun> oh.  let me try this.
[06:28:32] <someone-noone> for (var i =0; i < 10; i++) el.click(function(){console.log(i)}); will print 9 for all elements. How to make it printing 0 to 9 values?
[06:28:57] <Cork> someone-noone: store the value for each iteration
[06:29:05] <Cork> right now you use one variable and change its value
[06:29:23] <Cork> a function (scope) inside the for loop is enough
[06:29:27] <someone-noone> Cork, can you show me small example?
[06:29:30] <Cork> or you could just use $.each instead
[06:30:21] <Nancy2012> Hello All.. I have been facing a problem in my code since morning.. Is anyone here ever worked on JSON Object loading on Google Map.. here is my code and here is my ticket as well
[06:30:23] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/dL3CV/4/
[06:30:28] <Cork> for(var i=0;i<10;i++) { (function() { var j = i; el.click(function() { console.log(j); }); }) }
[06:30:41] <someone-noone> thanks!
[06:30:51] <Nancy2012> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8619286/reading-json-for-google-map-clustering
[06:30:56] <Cork> someone-noone: but that is most likely not what you want to do, but as you only showed psudo code you will get an unoptimal solution
[06:32:59] <ninjashogun> Cork, do you mind if I PM you about this example?  I'm running it now
[06:33:21] <Cork> ninjashogun: i don't have time to help you too much sorry
[06:33:31] <someone-noone> Cork, well var j=i didn't change the behaviour
[06:33:46] <Cork> someone-noone: did you use the function scope?
[06:33:52] <Cork> (function() {})() ?
[06:33:59] <ninjashogun> well, I just don't want to embarrass myself.  What is the example supposed to do?  The browser asks to share camera and mic - so far so good - then what...it doesn't do anything?
[06:34:14] <ninjashogun> at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.getUserMedia
[06:34:17] <someone-noone> yes
[06:34:23] <Cork> someone-noone: then it should work
[06:34:31] <Cork> if not show an example of the problem
[06:34:59] <someone-noone> ah, well did you mean ( and ) ? No, I didn't. Let me learn it why I need i t
[06:35:28] <Ansikt> I read in a stackoverflow post that jQuery uses css
[06:35:44] <Cork> Ansikt: ya?
[06:35:53] <Cork> it uses html too...
[06:36:16] <Ansikt> 's animate property in the jQuery().animate() method when it's supported.  I can't find any information to back this up.  True or false?
[06:36:32] <Ansikt> Cork: Accidentally hit enter when I meant to type an apostrophe.  Stupid sausage fingers.
[06:37:16] <Cork> Ansikt: well both .css and .animate uses an internal function to change values yes
[06:37:25] <Cork> and yes that function has support for animation
[06:37:36] <Ansikt> Cork: yes, but what I'm asking is:
[06:37:49] <Cork> .show/hide/fadeIn/fadeOut... all use this function
[06:38:03] <Ansikt> When jQuery animates a "left" property in Firefox, does it do something like:
[06:38:26] <Cork> Ansikt: jquery has a setInterval timer looping
[06:38:30] <Cork> this one generates ticks
[06:38:39] <seutje> it doesn't rly care about what specific browser though
[06:38:42] <Ansikt> Cork: Really?  That sucks.
[06:38:45] <Cork> those ticks are used to check the date(timestamp) and from that do the animation
[06:38:49] <someone-noone> Cork, thanks , it works!
[06:38:59] <Cork> Ansikt: yes they updated it to use requestAnimationFrame
[06:39:25] <Cork> but all the slideshow plugins broke (cause they used setInterval in conjunction with animate)
[06:39:38] <seutje> see http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[06:39:41] <Cork> so cause of this they backed out the change and we are stuck with setInterval
[06:40:07] <Cork> and cause of that i don't use animate
[06:40:17] <seutje> https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-requestAnimationFrame
[06:40:48] <Ansikt> Argh.  That's really inefficient.
[06:40:52] <Cork> yup
[06:41:10] <Cork> especially with how it will keep devices from going into sleep mode and so on
[06:41:34] <Cork> and animations will keep happening even when the page isn't visible
[06:41:42] <Cork> (this change was what broke the slideshows)
[06:41:48] <seutje> haven't had to need to use an animation that couldn't just be a css transition in a while
[06:41:57] <Cork> ya, same here
[06:42:20] <Cork> only big limitation to css animation is that you can't animate heights
[06:42:40] <Cork> or rather height: auto and width: auto
[06:42:55] <Cork> there is hacks, but they don't work right
[06:43:41] <Ansikt> Yeah, it's a pain in the ass to css animate height:auto.  I've got a copy of a large chunk of my dom in a visibility:hidden; div because of this.
[06:44:20] <seutje> yeah, but I rarely use animations, mainly just transition
[06:44:21] <Ansikt> I was going to switch to jQuery.animate, but it looks like I won't want to after all.
[06:44:26] <dwarder> how do i get chars from 2 to 7 ?
[06:44:33] <Cork> seutje: well transition is an animation
[06:44:37] <seutje> for width, it's usually an easy workaround, but height rly is annoying
[06:44:39] <dwarder> string[2]+string[3] ....
[06:44:40] <dwarder> ?
[06:44:42] <Cork> seutje: and it has the same limitation
[06:44:53] <seutje> yeah, but css animations have a whole extra set of issues
[06:45:01] <Cork> true
[06:45:05] <Cork> blink reborn :)
[06:45:10] <seutje> :D
[06:45:24] <Ansikt> Just found a pretty good plugin which seems to assauge my fears: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[06:45:30] <Cork> i've actually helped users add back support for <blink> when firefox removed it :D
[06:45:33] <Cork> with css animate
[06:45:37] <seutje> speaking of which, am I the only one who runs into an obscure repaint issue like almost daily for the past few weeks
[06:45:55] <seutje> (on the chromesies)
[06:46:05] <Cork> chromium has been stable for me
[06:46:18] <seutje> 99% of the time it happens in this huge app and I can't for the life of me reduce the testcase
[06:46:39] <Cork> but ya chrome has bitten me many times with rendering bugs
[06:46:44] <seutje> and repaint workarounds make me feel so stupid
[06:46:45] <Cork> more then most other browsers
[06:46:55] <seutje> this.id = this.id; // I FIX!
[06:47:02] <Cork> :)
[06:47:25] <Cork> seutje: sounds a bit wacky, but i usually manage to fix them with zoom: 1;
[06:47:37] <Cork> (YES i know that is suppose to be an ie hack)
[06:47:47] <Ansikt> join documentcloud
[06:47:48] <seutje> usually it's an issue where I change the content and the rendering doesn't update properly
[06:47:53] <Cork> but it often fixes rendering bugs in webkit too
[06:48:01] <seutje> like I'll shove some text in an element and it won't expand untill I trigger reflow
[06:48:11] <Cork> wow
[06:48:21] <Cork> can't say i've ever seen that
[06:48:30] <seutje> and it'll only fix it when I do it pretty much at runtime when I'm sure I'm done shoving the text in
[06:48:33] <Cork> i've had problem with display: none > display: block a few times
[06:48:50] <seutje> almost like it didn't notice it changed and I have to prod it like "yo...wakey wakey!"
[06:48:58] <Cork> ya
[06:49:02] <ewagner1> Damn $(document).on("change", "div#section2" function() { console.log('log section 2'); }); doesn't recognize that the contents of #section2 changes

W
[06:49:05] <Nancy2012> should i do :(
[06:49:22] <Cork> ewagner1: change is for form elements, not dom content
[06:49:24] <Nancy2012> please help me â€¦ Here is my code.. http://jsfiddle.net/dL3CV/5/
[06:49:33] <Cork> ewagner1: also, don't use tag names infront of id's
[06:49:42] <Cork> ewagner1: it slows down the selector for no good reason

[06:50:09] <ewagner1> Cork: Yeah I don't normally add that much specifity
[06:50:23] <Nancy2012> it is very strange.. becoz whenever i use JSON code in the same file..it works
[06:50:47] <Nancy2012> but what is the problem if i placed n call it by URL
[06:50:51] <Nancy2012> any idea?
[07:01:37] <JAAulde> Good morning all! The company I work for and I are VERY hungry to learn how to make accessible pages and, more specifically, accessible web applications. We are having a very hard time finding solid information which, when applied, works reliably. It seems that whole area of our discipline is very young and has barely started to come together. To our end, can anyone recommend and training classes or consulting firms we could hire to helps us ga

[07:02:40] <Cork> JAAulde: ^
[07:03:57] <JAAulde> Thanks Cork. We have done much reading and experiementing, including that site. At this point we are ready to hire someone for training and consulting so I was wondering if anyone had leads on something like that
[07:04:13] <Cork> JAAulde: then you are in the wrong channel
[07:04:31] <Cork> this is a support channel for jquery, not a request for hire
[07:04:31] <JAAulde> Cork: yeah, I know...I am casting a wide dragnet.
[07:04:50] <Cork> well there are channels for those requests, so try to keep on topic
[07:05:04] <JAAulde> ok

[07:10:29] <joroci> it's solved in stackoverflow :)
[07:12:34] <hopkin> That was asked a year ago looks like Nancy = Anna who just posted on that question

[07:24:14] <Nancy2012> everything seems ok..
[07:24:30] <delboy1978uk> eh keizer? what have i missed?
[07:24:31] <Keizer> $(document).on("click", "#className", function() { });
[07:24:33] <Nancy2012> but whenever i try to access JSON from external link.. it doesnt work
[07:24:40] <delboy1978uk> ah!
[07:24:43] <Keizer> Erm .classname
[07:24:51] <Nancy2012> my code is very simple and please help me
[07:24:53] <Keizer> Period is for class # is for ID
[07:25:04] <Keizer> I am trying to debug some horrible shit right now
[07:25:32] <seutje> Nancy2012: you are trying to parse the string 'http://www.samirayousefi.com/json/data3.json' as JSON?
[07:25:37] <Keizer> KendoUI template iterating rows onto a page and then trying to identify which rows were added and then run a getJSON
[07:25:47] <delboy1978uk> yeah i know cheers, im ok at jQ but just a little out of touch (pun intended)
[07:25:54] <seutje> Nancy2012: it helps when you download the resource at that location instead of trying to parse the location identifier
[07:26:53] <Bauer1> guys, I am using sliders from jqueryUI: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values but one of the sliders I need to have preset 6 different possible values. I dont see how to do this? it only allows me to do multiple handles :) which is useless...
[07:26:56] <Velveeta> nancy2012: seutje has your answer, because i stuck that json into your fiddle as a literal string and it parsed just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/XtzjZ/390/
[07:27:00] <delboy1978uk> nope! tapping the screen still wont click();
[07:27:02] <Keizer> Anyone here ever used the KendoUI with Jquery? I have been doing it for  bit but now I run into an issue where I can't do a selection of the items that were iterated by KendoUI
[07:27:12] <Velveeta> but you're running the url through the parsing function, not the json itself, you need to use getJSON
[07:27:38] <delboy1978uk> paste some code keizer, maybe we can swap problems for 5 mins ;-)
[07:27:56] <Nancy2012> on my localhost.. i m giving the path of my json..
[07:28:19] <Nancy2012> and it workâ€¦ problem is that i m using MarkerClusterer
[07:28:20] <Keizer> delboy1978uk: The situation is too convoluted
[07:28:29] <Nancy2012> for loading the lat, lng on the google map
[07:28:37] <Nancy2012> here you can see
[07:28:38] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/dL3CV/5/
[07:29:36] <Nancy2012> what i found a solution.. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8619286/reading-json-for-google-map-clustering)â€¦ So i was following the same way as you can see on it..
[07:29:48] <jost> I'm trying to select all elements having a certain class and having a radio button as descendant with jQuery... ist that possible?
[07:30:07] <Nancy2012> here this guy says.. I'm accepting this as the answer since it fixed the problem I was having with going through the loop. It would seem that I still have issue feeding the data into the loop as the .getJSON isn't reading my file, but when I put the json into a .parseJSON string, it works properly
[07:30:19] <Velveeta> jost: $('.certainClass:has(:radio)')
[07:30:38] <Nancy2012> so I tried to use .parseJSON as you can use underneath of this post
[07:30:43] <Bauer1> guys, I am using sliders from jqueryUI: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values but one of the sliders I need to have preset 6 different possible values. I dont see how to do this? it only allows me to do multiple handles :) which is useless... how to do a slider with preset values?
[07:31:06] <jost> Velveeta:  awsome, thanks :-)
[07:31:13] <Velveeta> jost: no problem
[07:31:17] <Nancy2012> Velveeta: have u had this same problem..
[07:31:42] <Velveeta> nancy2012: nope, but what i can tell you is that you're using parseJSON wrong in your example, you have to pass it actual json, not a url to a json file
[07:31:56] <delboy1978uk> wtf ok maybe this would be why: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$(document).on')
[07:31:56] <Nancy2012> ok
[07:32:08] <delboy1978uk> however jquery has definitely loaded!
[07:32:23] <Velveeta> if getJSON wasn't working properly for you, were you using it properly? were you using it asynchronously with a callback to then use the json it retrieved? or were you trying to do something like var json = $.getJSON(url); ?
[07:32:38] <Velveeta> a lot of people use those async functions wrong and then think they don't work
[07:33:22] <delboy1978uk> haha looks like they were on jQuery 1.5.2 lmao puke
[07:35:55] <delboy1978uk> thanks again Keizer
[07:36:06] <Keizer> np delboy1978uk
[07:36:20] <Keizer> Yeah I been using JQ since before the .live() days
[07:36:21] <Keizer> It was fun
[07:36:28] <Keizer> But .on() has now taken over
[07:36:29] <Velveeta> yeah i remember back when 1.2 was bleeding edge :D
[07:41:32] <andrew91_> hello
[07:48:09] <joroci> hey jedimind
[07:49:23] <jedimind> ?
[07:49:47] <joroci>  ? ?
[07:50:06] <joroci> do you know the dragstart dragend events?
[07:54:58] <MANCHUCK> is there a seperate channel for jQuery mobile?
[07:55:12] <MANCHUCK> oh nvm just read the message
[08:04:23] <Keizer> Nested loops in JS....
[08:07:18] <shoky> derp
[08:07:43] <Keizer> shoky: Yeah man derp to the max
[08:08:06] <doebi> i get an error in jqueryui 'a.curCSS is not a function' it seems that this is deprecated, does this mean i have an old lib or that my script is using an deprecated function?
[08:08:39] <Keizer> doebi: Are you tyring to display the classes?
[08:08:57] <shoky> doebi: it means some library you're using is not updated to work with newer jquery that you're using
[08:09:08] <doebi> shoky: k, thx
[08:09:24] <doebi> so i have to manually fix the script, since i am not the author.. :/
[08:09:31] <doebi> i hoped to avoid that
[08:09:44] <shoky> you know where it's coming from?
[08:10:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> doebi: or you could use older verison of jquery
[08:10:47] <shoky> doebi: you can also try jquery.migrate plugin as a workaround
[08:12:34] <doebi> Rohan_Bhangui: no option, jquery is globally used on that site, cant just change it for one feature
[08:12:39] <doebi> shoky: whats that?
[08:15:17] <shoky> doebi: it restores some of the APIs that older jquery's removed, though actually im not sure it's relevant to curCSS
[08:16:43] <shoky> doebi: anyway it's really simple to fix it
[08:17:43] <doebi> yeah i just read, that curCSS is a replace for css, but adding the methd to call .css didn't work :/
[08:18:00] <shoky> show the change you made
[08:18:16] <shoky> what lib is it in..?
[08:18:28] <shoky> the ideal solution is to upgrade the lib ;p
[08:19:04] <doebi> i added http://pastebin.com/cig6d2CD to the deprecated script
[08:19:23] <computer2000> i want to load a special css for ie8 only, but without loading the standard css file which is for all other browsers. how can i do that? knowing that ie10 doesnt parse conditional comments anymore
[08:19:35] <shoky> doebi eh.. don't do that
[08:20:07] <doebi> shoky: how to fix it then?
[08:20:23] <shoky> doebi: what lib is it?
[08:20:37] <doebi> what?
[08:20:45] <shoky> what script is it in...
[08:20:51] <shoky> what are you editing
[08:21:13] <doebi> a custom script for adding suggestfunctionality to a search form
[08:21:23] <shoky> why are you editing this one?
[08:22:23] <doebi> cause it gives an error?
[08:22:40] <shoky> does the error have a stack trace
[08:22:46] <shoky> that you can expand
[08:26:45] <fortysixandtwo> Any idea how I can get this regex to work? This is my go so far: http://pastebin.com/WmJ5iMGM
[08:27:00] <doebi> shoky: i just tried to update the jquery ui lib, and now it gives another error
[08:33:46] <shoky> doebi: thanks for the update
[08:33:46] <andyface> forsixandtwo: try putting \r\n after each section that will be on a new line - https://www.debuggex.com/r/IiXgrZTcEhSerigA
[08:34:21] <shoky> that link doesn't work at all
[08:34:31] <andyface> bums
[08:34:42] <shoky> and that doesn't solve his problem..
[08:34:44] <andyface> <!-- __remove -->\r\n.*?\r\n<!-- remove__ -->
[08:34:51] <shoky> oh
[08:35:06] <shoky> nicer to change . to [\s\S] or something
[08:35:19] <shoky> actually not nicer, but better
[08:37:39] <Keizer> shoky: I figured out the problem. When nesting jquery within Kendo and you want to iterate your variables have to look like this ${objectName.index}
[08:39:58] <shoky> Keizer: cool. i have no idea what the original problem was but glad you figured it out ;p
[08:40:46] <shoky> also, never used kendo
[08:41:35] <Keizer> shoky: lol I am inclined to agree
[08:51:28] <Nomikos> I have a href link to another site, and a click handler on it that pings our server - everything runs except our server is not pinged.. is this a security thing?
[08:52:01] <Keizer> Nomikos: You are going event.preventDefault ?
[08:52:27] <Keizer> Then you would need to run an AJAX query to your server and then redirect the user upon .done()
[08:54:53] <Nomikos> Keizer: hrm. there's no e.preventDefault, just a e.stopPropagation();
[08:55:44] <Nomikos> Keizer: chrome had issues with opening a blank window using JS, seeing it as an unwanted popup, so I wanted to use the href
[08:56:26] <Keizer> Nomikos: Well basically you can define a selector for the links that you desire to be tracked, then to a e.preventDefault and then get the $(this).attr('href'); and send that to your server and then proceed to redirect them to $(this).attr('href');
[09:00:06] <jop008> This is my code to save data the code has an error since I got two times the second row. The console output included http://fiddle.jshell.net/PENRD/3/
[09:00:29] <jop008> Don't know how to debug this
[09:11:06] <jop008> This is my code to save data the code has an error since I got two times the second row. The console output included http://fiddle.jshell.net/PENRD/3/
[09:11:20] <jop008> so row 2 is saved twice
[09:12:57] <NoiseEee> why aren;t you using jquery's XHR stuff?
[09:13:09] <NoiseEee> what the heck is "genmeta" ?
[09:17:34] <Nomikos> fish :)
[09:18:52] <jop008> issue solved
[09:19:13] <Nomikos> jop008: what was it?
[09:19:41] <jop008> the call back was wrong no assignment to the index solved by this
[09:19:43] <jop008>       if (nindex < nlencal -1) {
[09:19:44] <jop008>         nindex ++;
[09:19:45] <jop008>         save_bookcalendar ( nindex, nlencal);
[09:19:46] <jop008>       }
[09:20:39] <Nomikos> uh ok. I thought it might be something like the function was triggered twice somehow
[09:22:26] <_BigWings_1> I can't get my jquery ui tabs to fill the available vertical space
[09:22:32] <_BigWings_1> im using http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-heightStyle
[09:22:47] <_BigWings_1> but its still not filling up the parent
[09:38:48] <BillCriswell> _BigWings_1: Have it living somewhere?
[09:39:36] <ThoMe> exit
[10:09:57] <AntelopeSalad> i have a working implementation of what i'm trying to do but i'm wondering if there's a better "jquery way" of doing it, i feel like i brute forced it into submission -- https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7549719
[10:11:24] <miniml> Hi. Has anyone had any issued with IE11? jQuery doesn't get loaded well for some reason.
[10:11:34] <_BigWings_1> BillCriswell: figured it out
[10:12:02] <_BigWings_1> I was adding the .tabs declaration on an object that wasn't in the dom yet
[10:12:10] <_BigWings_1> had to do .tabs("refresh)
[10:12:50] <wachpwnski> how can I sort the display order of option tags by inner html?
[10:13:32] <wachpwnski> <option value="1">B</option>  <option value="2">A</option>, I want it to be in the order of A B
[10:19:15] <Bauer1> guys, I am using sliders from jqueryUI: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values but there is no info how to show buttons (like you have in windows on the edge of the scroll slider) - is it possible to do them without reinventing the wheel now with Javascript?
[10:24:11] <hugo_moss> can a jquery $.get using ajax cause a redirect?
[10:25:17] <shoky> wachpwnski:  var select = $('select');  select.children().sort(function(a,b) { return a.text.localeCompare(b.text); }).appendTo(select)
[10:25:56] <shoky> hugo_moss: what do you mean by a redirect?
[10:26:18] <shoky> it can't cause the browser to change the location
[10:26:27] <shoky> of the window
[10:27:52] <hugo_moss> well im doing an ajax get request to try to retrieve html, and replace the current html with that one with no page refresh
[10:28:02] <hugo_moss> but it keeps redirecting the page
[10:28:17] <shoky> it's not the $.get doing it
[10:28:48] <hugo_moss> if the php code includes a redirect, will it still redirect even though its ajax?
[10:28:50] <hugo_moss> im new to ajax
[10:29:00] <shoky> the browser should follow the redirect transparently
[10:29:12] <hugo_moss> so it will still redirect?
[10:29:15] <shoky> now you're talking about a completely different redirect though...
[10:29:20] <shoky> 2 totally separate things
[10:29:25] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:29:39] <shoky> so, what are you asking ;]
[10:29:43] <hugo_moss> lol
[10:30:06] <hugo_moss> well if my php code causes a redirect, will the page redirect even though im using a jquery ajax get request?
[10:30:13] <shoky> ugh
[10:30:21] <hugo_moss> i thought that using ajax get will prevent the page from refreshing
[10:30:31] <shoky> what does "the page redirect" mean
[10:30:47] <shoky> now you;re using the 2 separate meanings in the same sentence.. we're going backwrdsa
[10:30:50] <shoky> backwards
[10:30:58] <hugo_moss> sorry
[10:31:18] <hugo_moss> i dont understand
[10:31:23] <shoky> php causes an http redirect that the browser follows transparently. this doesn't cause the page to refresh or anything
[10:31:58] <needsomehelp> Hi, I need a script that automatically change a link like http://www.blackscaped.de/CDs/CDs-0-A/Acid-Drinkers-Acid-Empire-1989-2008::53990.html to http://www.blackscaped.de/product_info.php?ref=51&products_id=53990. Any help?
[10:32:00] <hugo_moss> what do you mean follows transparently?
[10:32:19] <shoky> i mean that you won't even know the php redirect happens
[10:32:27] <shoky> you'll just get the data from the redirected page
[10:32:40] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:32:44] <shoky> unless you meant something else by "the php code includes a redirect"
[10:32:53] <hugo_moss> well all i mean is
[10:33:01] <hugo_moss> the page goes to a different url
[10:33:12] <shoky> that doesnt say anything...
[10:33:15] <shoky> need to be more precise
[10:33:55] <shoky> pages don't just go to different urls.
[10:34:07] <hugo_moss> well when i do the ajax request its going to a different url
[10:34:17] <shoky> what's different about it
[10:34:32] <shoky> what happened to the 1st url
[10:34:43] <hugo_moss> ok let me be more specific
[10:35:09] <blingmading> hello
[10:36:17] <hugo_moss> i have an index page, i click on a link, and it shows a modal popup in the same page, the modal popup has a form, however i have removed the forms action, and removed the buttons actions, im using an onclick event to perform an ajax request
[10:36:28] <blingmading> http://pastie.org/private/a9wmgmqamsbvyh4qg6ow i'm doing form submit to check if they are logged in and if not, pop a modal and them them logged in. when they hit submit again, it doesn't submit the form because it says event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[10:37:08] <hugo_moss> i dont know what else to say
[10:37:16] <shoky> what exactly do you want to know
[10:37:38] <hugo_moss> what is causing the page to change to a different url, and not just remain on the same page, and just update the content
[10:38:00] <hugo_moss> can it be the php code?
[10:38:01] <shoky> either a click on a link, a form submit, or some script changing window.location
[10:38:03] <shoky> no
[10:38:08] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[10:38:12] <hugo_moss> thats what i wanted to know
[10:38:23] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:38:27] <hugo_moss> thanks shoky
[10:38:44] <hugo_moss> i think it might be some script that is being included
[10:39:26] <shoky> try calling event.preventDefault() for the submit event
[10:39:34] <shoky> could be the form submitting
[10:40:25] <blingmading> http://pastie.org/private/a9wmgmqamsbvyh4qg6ow i'm doing form submit to check if they are logged in and if not, pop a modal and them them logged in. when they hit submit again, it doesn't submit the form because it says event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead. /
[10:40:32] <blingmading> oops sorry didn't mean to paste it again.
[10:40:55] <blingmading> i was saying why would that work - callling event.preventDefault again ?
[10:41:05] <shoky> blingmading: that warning message is fine, it has nothing to do with your problem most likely
[10:41:30] <shoky> blingmading: it's just an issue with chrome's recent update that jquery fixed for next version
[10:41:31] <blingmading> shoky so why won't return true work ? why is the form not being submitted ?
[10:41:45] <shoky> blingmading: o didnt look at your code, sec
[10:42:09] <shoky> blingmading: you're calling event.preventDefault()
[10:42:16] <shoky> blingmading: doesn't matter what you return after that
[10:42:29] <shoky> it's prevented
[10:42:37] <hugo_moss> shoky yup thats what it was
[10:42:40] <hugo_moss> it was the form submitting
[10:42:48] <shoky> blingmading: only call it if you're sure you don't want a submit
[10:42:51] <hugo_moss> i thought that if you just remove the action it wouldnt submit or whatever
[10:42:52] <shoky> hugo_moss: coolz
[10:42:58] <hugo_moss> so i removed the form
[10:43:04] <blingmading> shoky so if i don't call event.preventDefault, then the form submits anyways without the modal finishing
[10:43:11] <hugo_moss> and it works, thank you
[10:43:13] <shoky> hugo_moss: nah browsers like to submit forms ;]
[10:43:25] <hugo_moss> :)
[10:43:30] <blingmading> basically, i want to capture the click on the button to submit the form, check some stuff then allow it to go through or not.
[10:43:50] <shoky> blingmading: uhm. you'll need to manually submit it after your modal is finished
[10:44:12] <blingmading> shoky i thought return true would manually submit the form?
[10:44:14] <shoky> blingmading: e.g.  $('#CoForm')[0].submit();
[10:44:19] <blingmading> gotcha. thanks.
[10:44:24] <shoky> blingmading:  your modal is not a real modal, is it..?
[10:44:57] <blingmading> shoky its a popup lightbox that allows you to type in username password and hit login which autenticates with a service and sets cookies
[10:45:10] <shoky> ok, that doesn't sound like a real modal
[10:45:13] <blingmading> and then lightbox goes away.
[10:45:18] <shoky> i assume the call to Co.show('login');   returns immediately
[10:45:24] <blingmading> correct.
[10:45:36] <shoky> so your "return" is executed immediately, not when you close the modal
[10:45:44] <shoky> so nothing would happen when you close the modal
[10:45:53] <shoky> unless you make it happen ;p
[10:46:12] <Velveeta> ^^ what that guy said
[10:46:13] <blingmading> oh i see
[10:46:19] <blingmading> thanks for explaining that!
[10:46:24] <shoky> np
[10:47:31] <blingmading> shokey since i did $('#CoForm').submit(....) can i do $this.submit() ?
[10:48:02] <shoky> depends what $this is  but it sounds right ;p
[10:48:15] <shoky> ah but
[10:48:18] <blingmading> cool. i didn't want to define the form name again since its already defined on the top.
[10:48:20] <Velveeta> you're gonna have to do something to avoid an infinite recursive loop
[10:48:23] <shoky> the [0] is kina important
[10:48:25] <shoky> kinda
[10:48:29] <blingmading> oh
[10:48:31] <shoky> otherwise, what Velveeta said
[10:49:05] <shoky> that makes it call the native .submit() function instead of triggering the event handler
[10:49:21] <shoky> so $this[0].submit()  should prolly do
[10:49:25] <Velveeta> you could check your event object for a custom property, and if it doesn't exist, do whatever checks you want to do, and as part of that success, create a new $.Event('submit') and add a custom data property, and then do $(this).trigger(eventObj)
[10:49:39] <Velveeta> or yeah, what shoky said
[10:49:39] <Bauer1> guys, I am using sliders from jqueryUI: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values but there is no info how to show buttons (like you have in windows on the edge of the scroll slider) - is it possible to do them without reinventing the wheel now with Javascript?
[10:51:51] <Velveeta> bauer1: there's no info on how to show those kinds of buttons because they're not built into that slider widget i'm pretty sure
[10:52:02] <Velveeta> so if you want to add that functionality, you're gonna have to use javascript
[10:53:08] <Velveeta> it wouldn't be too hard though, just make a couple of buttons and bind their clicks to a fetch of the slider's value option, and then increment or decrement as appropriate and pass it back into the value option
[10:54:03] <Velveeta> or rather the value method, not option
[10:54:37] <Bauer1> Velveeta: yes I thought of that, but I dont see a way to know the slider's steps (intervals)
[10:55:08] <Velveeta> bauer1: 'step' is an option you can set yourself
[10:55:20] <Velveeta> or you can get the default with .slider('option', 'step')
[10:55:49] <Bauer1> Velveeta: yes, but if the slider has, say min value of 50, max value of 250, and steps are 50 units - how do I know the increments are by 50 units only?
[10:56:11] <Velveeta> i just told you how...
[10:56:52] <Bauer1> ohh I see, I missed that :) I saw the setter, not getter
[10:57:08] <Bauer1> guess its not too hard, will just take time I dont have
[10:57:13] <Velveeta> yep, all options have built-in setter and getters just through the number of parameters you pass to that function
[10:57:25] <Bauer1> still I am surprised, such basic functionality is not built in :)
[10:57:55] <Bauer1> I cant imagine a scroller in windows or linux wihout those buttons at the edge :P
[10:57:57] <Velveeta> that's because it's a slider control, not a windows scrollbar, such basic functionality wasn't deemed a feature they wanted to include
[10:58:04] <Bauer1> how comes jquery UI designers didnt think of that?
[10:58:22] <Velveeta> because it's not a scrollbar, it's a slider control, those are 2 different types of interface components :D
[10:58:48] <Bauer1> lol, semantics :P
[10:59:06] <Velveeta> not semantics, different use cases
[10:59:16] <Velveeta> you can use a slider control *as* a scrollbar, but that doesn't mean you're using it properly
[10:59:33] <Velveeta> it's meant for selecting something in a range of values, not scrolling back and forth in a pane
[10:59:56] <Bauer1> yeah, but isnt it reasonable a customer might expect also + and - buttons?
[11:00:00] <Bauer1> with a slider control
[11:00:24] <Bauer1> if you have range 0-250 with steps of 1, it might be hard hitting the desired value
[11:00:31] <Velveeta> yes, that's entirely possible.. and that's why they expose functionality to allow that type of enhancement to be built on
[11:00:37] <Ansikt> Bauer1: jQuery UI also isn't meant to be used without modification.
[11:01:16] <Ansikt> You're supposed to tack on your own functionality - there's no possible way for them to have prebuilt every possible widget a user might want for every possible use case.
[11:01:39] <Bauer1> hehe :) one can wish I suppose :D
[11:01:53] <Velveeta> one can do more than wishâ€¦ one could always contribute a patch back to the project ;)
[11:02:09] <shoky> doubt they'd accept ;p
[11:02:15] <saml> how do I get background image url of an element if any?
[11:02:17] <shoky> they give you buttons
[11:02:19] <shoky> they give you sliders
[11:02:25] <shoky> you can combine them and make a scrollbar
[11:02:25] <saml> $('#content-opener').css('background')    ==>   "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) url(http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/content/dam/fashion/shows/2013/fall/new-york/menswear/dkny/collection-full-length/22.jpg.r.nocrop.w2400.h2400.jpg) no-repeat scroll -286px -103px / auto padding-box border-box"
[11:02:26] <Velveeta> that's a good point also :D
[11:02:30] <saml> do I need to parse it manually?
[11:02:38] <shoky> why would they combine it for you into a special widget
[11:02:58] <Bauer1> I wouldnt know how to integrate something like that - my javascript is not that advanced. I can only do a function which uses jquery stuff, not extending it
[11:02:59] <Velveeta> saml: $('#content-opener').css('background-image')
[11:03:16] <saml> and parse url() part?
[11:03:24] <Velveeta> saml: yep
[11:03:26] <saml> thanks
[11:03:29] <Bauer1> shoky: because its widespread and popular widget?
[11:03:41] <Bauer1> to make it easier to integrate one quickly
[11:03:43] <saml> stackoverflow said so but i wanted to make sure if it's webscale solution
[11:03:47] <saml> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8809876/can-i-get-divs-background-image-url
[11:03:58] <Bauer1> shoky: same reason for jQuery.. you could do everything using only Javascript
[11:04:05] <Velveeta> you can't really complain that the jquery ui team isn't bundling in this "basic" functionality when you yourself admit to not being able to write this basic functionality
[11:05:04] <shoky> in any case i don't see scrollbars as a widespread and popular widget
[11:05:14] <Velveeta> right, since they come as native elements
[11:05:22] <blingmading> shoky to understand better the purpose of doing $(this)[0].submit(); instead of $(this).submit(); is to avoid infinite loop?
[11:05:30] <Velveeta> and besides, i almost gave you the exact method of implementing it on your own
[11:05:41] <Velveeta> it can literally be done like < 10 lines of javascript
[11:05:48] <shoky> blingmading:  $(this).submit()  would re-trigger your submit handler
[11:06:04] <Velveeta> which would in turn retrigger your submit handler
[11:06:13] <Velveeta> which would in turn retrigger your submit handler
[11:06:16] <Velveeta> ad infinitum
[11:06:19] <Bauer1> I know Velveeta its not difficult, but well we are all lazy and hate to reinvent the wheel, I am sure was invented 1000 times already
[11:06:34] <Velveeta> bauer1: if it hasn't been invented yet, then it's not reinventing the wheel
[11:06:35] <shoky> blingmading:  cause .submit() on a jquery object is a shortcut for triggering the 'submit' event + calling the native .submit()
[11:06:41] <Velveeta> at least in the case of this particular widget
[11:07:02] <Bauer1> Velveeta: I am sure southends of developers already had to manually implement such a 10 line function...
[11:07:27] <Velveeta> it's entirely possible, and if you can find their code to copy and paste, then you don't have to reinvent it yourself
[11:07:48] <Bauer1> :)
[11:07:49] <Velveeta> and if not, it's pretty basic to implement, even a lazy developer should be able to crank it out in 10 minutes
[11:07:50] <blingmading> thanks
[11:08:24] <Velveeta> but jquery ui is in the business of making reusable, modular componentsâ€¦ that means they have to be basic to form the foundation of a UI
[11:08:40] <Velveeta> that's why you get basic components like buttons, and dialogs, and sliders
[11:08:51] <Velveeta> and not more advanced combinations of those things that one can easily combine themselves
[11:09:11] <Bauer1> yeah, I understand but doesnt mean I have to like it :)
[11:09:26] <Velveeta> rightio
[11:09:45] <Velveeta> but in the time you've spent here complaining about it, you could have written it about 5x over :D
[11:10:07] <Bauer1> somehow complaining is more fun :D
[11:10:15] <Velveeta> and yet not nearly as rewarding :)
[11:11:13] <Bauer1> lol, to me, doing it is not really rewarding, because the happiness is only momentary.. because I know after 10 mins, they will say they want something else
[11:11:19] <Bauer1> its never ending
[11:11:50] <rina> complaining is for the weak :)
[11:11:51] <Velveeta> to me, it's totally rewarding, because no matter how much requirements change, programming is a constantly learning process so you can be better equipped to tackle the next problem you're faced with
[11:12:24] <rina> for sure like right now im learning django :D
[11:12:34] <Velveeta> and then when something like this comes up, you don't have to say your javascript is not that advanced, you can just say "ok, gimme a few minutes"
[11:12:37] <Bauer1> Thats true, each time I get a little better and learn more JS quirks. but I rarely work so heavily with JS
[11:13:22] <Bauer1> usually like now once a year, when they launch their "campaign", and give me a week to do work, instead of doing it slowly in advance
[11:13:41] <Bauer1> and the rest of the year, I barely touch JS
[11:13:59] <Velveeta> you should make an effort to touch it more often, it likes being touched
[11:14:18] <Velveeta> and it's the language of the web, and only going to become more and more prolific, as long as dart doesn't get its way i suppose :)
[11:15:10] <Bauer1> lol, prolific? you think its more important than server side languages?
[11:15:26] <Velveeta> javascript is taking over the server side now also, so yes, definitely more prolific
[11:15:47] <Bauer1> I hate having to deal with testing on different browsers, or how sometimes my XHR requests are being done differently, and I cant really find out why - something that never happens on proper server side languages
[11:16:04] <Velveeta> node usage is exploding right now, if not for back end services (which it's used for also), as middle-tier delegation or even as part of build and deploy processes
[11:16:43] <Velveeta> well, that's why there's a library like jquery, to normalize the behavior of those things across browsers and give the developer as consistent of a development environment as possible
[11:17:04] <Velveeta> it abstracts away a lot of the quirks of js development so you don't have to worry about them, and can instead just worry about the css quirks that come w/ browsers
[11:18:07] <Bauer1> well, sometimes its still hard to find what causes certain behaviour, like I do a $.ajax call with certain URL, but in browser, I get entirely different url, with added parameters I did not specify
[11:18:20] <Bauer1> it works, but I cant figure out how and where those parameters are added, or why
[11:18:32] <Bauer1> this kind of stuff never happens in PHP or toher languages for example
[11:18:44] <Bauer1> and this stuff drives me mad, and causes me to run away from JS
[11:20:00] <Velveeta> if you just do a straight up $.ajax call, you don't get extra parameters added in the browser, that function does nothing more than normalize an xhr transmission
[11:20:10] <Velveeta> so those parameters have to be coming from somewhere in your code
[11:20:44] <Bauer1> no way, I already checked the string passed to .ajax in debug mode, and it does not contain the extra stuff I see in the network tab
[11:20:55] <Bauer1> means something else in jquery/javascript adds them
[11:21:30] <Velveeta> nothing in jquery or javascript adds any parameters to xhr requests, i'm telling youâ€¦ are you just doing a straight up $.ajax(<string url>) and that's it, or are you passing extra properties?
[11:22:12] <Bauer1> of course I have extra params, I have type, url, data and async:false
[11:22:26] <Bauer1> and to the URL I give, it adds extra GET parameters
[11:22:40] <Velveeta> right, because you're passing a data parameter
[11:22:48] <Bauer1> that dont show up in debug mode, until the call goes through to the .ajax, and then I cant track it (damn the minification)
[11:22:50] <Velveeta> any data parameter that's passed gets serialized into the url string
[11:23:03] <Bauer1> but thats a POST, not a get..
[11:23:09] <Velveeta> that's both post and get
[11:23:21] <Velveeta> post passes them in the post data, get passes them in the get data, e.g. the url
[11:24:01] <Velveeta> also, async: false is now deprecated
[11:24:02] <Velveeta> ;)
[11:24:45] <Bauer1> I use jquery 1.3 :P
[11:25:00] <Velveeta> oh wow.. aye yai yai
[11:25:12] <Velveeta> you realize that's like 3 years old or something right?
[11:26:03] <Velveeta> oh wow, it's actually *almost* 5 years old according to wikipedia
[11:26:23] <Bauer1> Velveeta: you are welcome to see for yourself: https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm# click the vCloud (on the right), then click Checkout, while watching network tab (persistent!) you will see https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH='+SingleObject.NAME_PATH, becomes something else entirely (extended with extra params I did not provide not in URL, nor in the data part
[11:26:43] <Bauer1> Velveeta: its not by choice, any attempt to replace the built in jquery in system caused more errors
[11:26:51] <Bauer1> we'll have to wait for them to update it
[11:27:14] <Bauer1> in internal systems I build and maintain of course I use newer stuff
[11:28:03] <Bauer1> just look for SingleObject.NAME_PATH in the test.js file, you will see how it adds parameters I never spcified in code..
[11:32:15] <Velveeta> so, i see 2 ajax requests being made here, one of which is only sending the NAME_PATH=vm, and the other is sending it with extra properties because they're being specified in the SecondPost options object
[11:33:36] <Velveeta> in DoPostAction
[11:35:21] <Bauer1> yes Velveeta, and what about the first POST request? where does it disappear, even when Preserve Log is turned on? I see it being replaced somehow with the second request
[11:35:41] <Velveeta> i see both requests happening
[11:35:48] <Velveeta> one's not replacing the other
[11:36:12] <Bauer1> with Chrome?
[11:36:17] <Velveeta> yep
[11:37:26] <Bauer1> I dont have tools to record video, but I am telling you, first request disappears.. I cant see it
[11:38:37] <Bauer1> Velveeta: this shows up for only a split second: http://screencast.com/t/wsqYXb3DeHKb before its replaced with the second URL (which seems like first one being extended)
[11:39:32] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: that shows up after both XHR requests / when its moved to a new page.
[11:39:40] <NoiseEee> XHR finished loading: "https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=vm&SCREEN=vm&view=edit&lineNr=0". index.php?StoreID=76&act=js:7221XHR finished loading: "https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=vm&SCREEN=CHECKOUT_SCREEN". index.php?StoreID=76&act=js:7221
[11:39:49] <NoiseEee> ^^ two separate XHR requests
[11:41:18] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: there should be 3 requests, final one is a .redirect to the final checkout page, and that is the third you see
[11:41:22] <Bauer1> but where is the first one? :)
[11:41:33] <Bauer1> like in my screenshot? with short url
[11:41:46] <NoiseEee> https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=vm&SCREEN=vm&view=edit&lineNr=0 is the first one.
[11:41:53] <Bauer1> no it is not
[11:42:07] <Bauer1> sec I post a code snippet
[11:42:32] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/DQp6V/
[11:42:48] <Bauer1> as you can see, first XHR is short, and it is missing in the list
[11:42:51] <NoiseEee> why are you using async false?
[11:43:14] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: because I need to ensure they are executed sequentially
[11:43:27] <Bauer1> and due to the old jqyert (1.3), I am limited in my tools
[11:43:31] <NoiseEee> well you should learn about callbacks at the very least, or callbacks
[11:43:39] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: s/or callbacks/or promises
[11:44:14] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: a) you're using a library from 5 years ago.  there is no way that is permissable in 2013, at all.  if you need, load up a modern version alongside.   b) use callbacks, not async:false to achieve sequential XHR requests
[11:44:23] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: yeah, but that is another thing I dont like about jquery: the terrible tendency to define functions and procedures within callbacks, making it readable, debuggable, and maintainble a hell
[11:44:27] <Xal_> Is there a way to have just the content of a page in a file and load the look & feel of the page, header and footer and everything from another file since it will be shared by all the pages on the site?
[11:44:28] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: i'm not going any further in this code because everything about it is bad practice
[11:44:44] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: thats JAVASCRIPT not jquery.  async, deal with it (tm)
[11:45:24] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: I tried once to load newer jquery along the old one, it didnt work without errors
[11:45:35] <Bauer1> I read about it, its not always possible
[11:45:46] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: why are you on jquery 1.3 ?
[11:46:26] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: because the old store code relies on it somehow, when I manually replaced it with newer versions, errors started poping up in other functions relying on the jquery
[11:47:20] <Xal_> I'd update the old code to use the new version of jquery
[11:47:45] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: either way, thats kind of beside the point (i say "kind of" because it has nothing to do with your problem, but using a 5-year-old library to write new code in 2013/2014 *is* a problem).  figure out a way to get them to run alongside if need be.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ see "load two version of jquery"
[11:47:53] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: really, you need to use callbacks and ditch the bad code.
[11:48:13] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: anyway the problem is not the ancient code I have to deal with, the discussion was about how one XHR request disappears with no trace :) as example why javascript is not as reliable and easy to debug as others
[11:48:39] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: people need to deal with sequential XHR requests all the time.  it is what it is.  async:false is *never* the answer.
[11:48:49] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: like I said, I read that page already in the pat (few months ago) and tried it, and it didnt work.. I will try again when I have time, perhaps I'd have some better luck this time
[11:49:14] <Xal_> Can anyone suggest anything with what I was asking? Basically I'm trying to replicate the effect of asp.net masterpages but have no back end coding
[11:49:22] <Bauer1> NoiseEee: doing a callback like complete: function() { stuff..} is NOT a readable way to do  it
[11:50:08] <NoiseEee> Bauer1: indent / use function references, whatever you can to make it 'readable' to you.  doing the wrong thing to make it look good to you is not the answer. anyways, good luck.
[11:50:39] <Bauer1> Xal_: sure, do ajax request, and pour the results into a specific div in the "master page"
[11:51:03] <Bauer1> thanks NoiseEee, I'll need that luck :)
[12:05:10] <ThoMe> good eevening :-)
[12:07:22] <ThoMe> anaony heere?
[12:07:36] <ThoMe> have a question. i have this code: <tr id="printername"><td class="status">blub</td><td class="date">schwups</td><td><a href="#" class="stopPrinter">Stop</a></td></tr>
[12:08:14] <ThoMe> when i click "Stop" i will change the value from example tr id =printername" the td value "status" from blub to test
[12:08:16] <Xal_> Is the only way to use js to bring in other js libraries still document.write("<scr" + "ipt src='.....'></scr" + "ipt>")
[12:08:17] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[12:08:25] <ThoMe> Xal_: can you help me?
[12:08:34] <ThoMe> how i get the id from the current tr?
[12:08:52] <Woet> ThoMe: yes, that is possible. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[12:09:04] <ThoMe> Woet: hiho
[12:09:05] <Xal_> attribute, I'd think
[12:09:08] <ThoMe> Woet: not closet?
[12:09:11] <ThoMe> cloest
[12:09:31] <Woet> Xal_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:09:43] <Woet> basically, document.write or ajax + eval
[12:10:01] <Xal_> .attr()
[12:10:19] <Xal_> Oh, nice. Thanks
[12:10:33] <nexxy> anything is possible when you use... imagination!
[12:10:58] <Woet> or when you smell like a man
[12:12:05] <ThoMe> Woet: have this nor with trid = $(this).closest('tr').attr('id');
[12:12:05] <ThoMe> is the the same like parent?
[12:12:30] <Woet> ThoMe: no, else it wouldn't be a separate function
[12:12:44] <Woet> it might work out the same in certain scenarios
[12:13:42] <ThoMe> Woet: emm,
[12:14:01] <ThoMe> Woet: this trid = $(this).closest('tr').attr('id'); get the same result like this trid = $(this).parents('tr').attr("id");
[12:14:08] <ThoMe> which is now "better" ? :-)
[12:14:35] <Woet> ThoMe: look for yourself, http://api.jquery.com/parent/ and http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:14:39] <ThoMe> ok. thx
[12:18:04] <Vasa> A question of opinion: Say i have 50 elemets with the same class which are dynamically updated, what would be faster, using the jquery.css or to use the hacky ways/plugins to add/edit the css rules over the whole page?
[12:18:13] <ThoMe> Woet: can i ask a last one please?
[12:18:21] <Woet> ThoMe: you can ask an unlimited amount of questions
[12:18:23] <faddah> Woet - just a note, crockford, in â€œJavaScript: The Good Partsâ€ warns heavily in his appendix against using "eval", as it being one of the "...â€œthe single most misused feature of JavaScript." (Excerpt From: Douglas Crockford. â€œJavaScript: The Good Parts.â€ iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=9E04D6037B345087B536E4E30DEBD28C). (my pages 151 - 152). it slows the runtime waaaaay down in your browse
[12:18:24] <faddah> as it is doing exactly what it says, evaluating the string and turning it into an object or numeric as needed programmatically. better just to write it without "eval".
[12:18:56] <Vasa> (i know that jquery.css is editing it inline, while the second approach is to edit the rule itself which is not supported by jquery itself)
[12:19:10] <faddah> he cites example "â€œeval("myValue = myObject." + myKey + ";");â€" can be re-written simply as:  "myvalue = myObject[myKey];"
[12:19:21] <faddah> (just saying.)
[12:20:56] <Vasa> the real question is, the look of the element, does it update faster when the style is edited in line vs when its for isntance appended into the <style> tags?
[12:21:20] <ThoMe> Woet: have a line: <tr id="bbdr01"><td class="printerState">stopped</td><td><a href="#" class="stopPrinter">Stop</a></td></tr> <<i would click to "Stop" and then change or get the td-value from this tr in class "printerState"
[12:21:47] <ThoMe> Woet: have: $('.stopPrinter').click(function(e) { trid = $(this).closest('tr').attr('id'); });
[12:21:52] <ThoMe> but now?
[12:22:27] <Woet> ThoMe: now you can traverse down
[12:24:13] <ThoMe> Woet: ah.. test = $(this).closest('tr').children('td.printerState').text(); :-)
[12:24:18] <ThoMe> Woet: thank you  :-)
[12:27:51] <Z_A_M> Is this an appropriate place to ask questions about ajax calls which return json objects? Or should I go to #javascript
[12:28:28] <ThoMe> when i change a td-text-value with $('#'+trid).children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text('blub'); and i get this value with $('#'+trid).children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text();
[12:28:32] <ThoMe> then he said: [object Object]
[12:28:34] <ThoMe> what is wrong?
[12:30:36] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Here works, or ##javascript. Whatever.
[12:30:56] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: can you help me?
[12:31:58] <BillCriswell> thelamest: What's the question?
[12:32:05] <BillCriswell> Sorry thelamest.
[12:32:08] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: ^^
[12:32:21] <ThoMe> ah now.
[12:32:23] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Thanks for the answer. Let me post my question.
[12:32:39] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: i change a table td value with: $('#'+trid).children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text('blub');
[12:32:48] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: when i get the value now: $('#'+trid).children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text();
[12:32:56] <ThoMe> then said firefox: [object Object]
[12:33:18] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: i must change not with text() or? is html() better?
[12:33:33] <Z_A_M> This is a simple exercise just trying to deal with getting json data from the server. I can't figure out why I can't get my search() function to log anything. https://dpaste.de/C3cI
[12:33:53] <Z_A_M> I'm assuming data is the correct parameter I need to pass the function.
[12:34:03] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: If you're putting in text use text(), otherwise .html().
[12:34:11] <Z_A_M> I know the function call itself works, but when I just test the function with a simple alert the alert pops up.
[12:35:07] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: what is difference text and html? and why said firefox when i get the value inside <td></td> "[object Object]" (alert).
[12:37:26] <Woet> ThoMe: why are you using the ID?
[12:37:38] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: If you're sending the dataType as json you shouldn't need to use parseJSON... oculd be throwing things off.
[12:37:39] <Woet> ThoMe: $(this).closest('tr').find('.printerState').text()
[12:37:40] <ThoMe> Woet: is it wrong?
[12:37:41] <ThoMe> hm. ok
[12:37:45] <Woet> looks easier
[12:37:48] <ThoMe> ok :-)
[12:38:04] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Yeah I tried it without that as well, and nothing.
[12:38:07] <Woet> and regarding your issue, please use www.jsfiddle.net to demonstrate if it continues to be an issue
[12:38:39] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: It doesn't even seem that data is anything. I tried to do console.log(data); but nothing gets there either. It's weird because the response I get back is the json data.
[12:38:50] <Z_A_M> So I know that the response is returning successfully.
[12:39:23] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: If you do console.log(data) in search does it log anything?
[12:39:25] <ravenzz> so
[12:39:53] <ravenzz> is event.currentTarget normalized (shimmed) in jQuery?
[12:40:39] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: I don't believe so... Looking here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[12:40:59] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Ah yes now I'm getting it.
[12:41:39] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Does it look like an object or a quoted string?
[12:41:46] <Z_A_M> [Object {pk=1, model="trackr.room", fields=Object}]
[12:41:56] <Z_A_M> I'm assuming that's an object.
[12:42:00] <ravenzz> BillCriswell mh currentTarget is there actually
[12:42:02] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[12:42:13] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Ok, so the parseJSON is probably breaking it.
[12:42:44] <BillCriswell> I imagine parseJSON would check to see if it was an object first but I guess not.
[12:43:09] <Z_A_M> Ahh okay. But how come when I am in the console in firebug, console.log(data); doesn't return the object again?
[12:43:26] <Z_A_M> Does data not exist anymore because the function has already been called?
[12:43:33] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: data can't live outside the success callback.
[12:43:43] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Makes sense.
[12:45:49] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: So how do I reference attributes of that json object now? I'm sorry asking these basic questions, but if you could point me at a good article I could read that'd be great so I'm not bothering you >.<
[12:47:26] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: It would just be like.. data.model, data.fields.whatever and so on.
[12:48:53] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Yeah I tried that, but it's not working. I thought I was doing it correct. I did data.model and got back an "undefined" message.
[12:50:25] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: if console.log(data) returns what you pasted there must be more doing on if data.model isn't working.
[12:50:41] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Try console.log( data, data.model );
[12:51:31] <BillCriswell> s/doing/going
[12:52:40] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: I understand that console.log(data) gives a list of objects back, but data.model is still undefined. This is what is returned [Object {pk=1, model="trackr.room", fields=Object}, Object {pk=2, model="trackr.room", fields=Object}] undefined
[12:55:17] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Oh, data is an array. Weird. You'd do like... $.each( data, function( i, item ){ console.log( item.model ); });
[12:55:54] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: mhm interesting.
[12:56:02] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: I will have to look up the .each()
[12:56:22] <ThoMe> hm. $(this).closest('tr').children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text(test); doesnt work inside $(this).closest('tr').children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text(test);
[12:56:26] <ThoMe> ups.
[12:56:33] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: I just through the [] around Object was decoration for some dumb reason.
[12:56:40] <ThoMe> this $(this).closest('tr').children('td.printerStateChangeTime').text(test); doesnt works in $.ajax({
[12:56:44] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[12:56:51] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: So when you do console.log(data) ir only shows the first object?
[12:57:09] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: this isn't what you think it is inside ajax probably.
[12:57:20] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: heh no worries. And no, it is showing all the correct objects. I just tested it out by adding another record in the database.
[12:57:33] <ThoMe> no?
[12:57:39] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: not just the first object.
[12:58:12] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Ah, so you just wanted to confuse me I see.
[12:58:33] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: heh :^)
[12:58:45] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: Glad you got it working though.
[12:58:48] <Z_A_M> woah, is that a snowman for anyone else?
[12:58:58] <Z_A_M> BillCriswell: Yeah me too man. Thanks a lot for walking me through the steps, I appreciate it.
[12:58:59] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: is a .children or
[12:59:03] <ThoMe> .closest problem ye?
[12:59:06] <ThoMe> i think .closest
[12:59:49] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: I need a complete code example to help. =)
[13:00:01] <BillCriswell> Z_A_M: No trouble at all.
[13:00:04] <ThoMe> is secret :P
[13:00:32] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: Not sure I can help then.
[13:00:51] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: thankx :-)
[13:02:05] <clime> hey I have just noticed that if you do ajax request with jquery and you pass this data object: {ids: [1,2]}, it will send two post params ids[]: 1 and ids[]: 2. That is fine but is there a way to prevent appening [] to parameter name?
[13:02:39] <clime> I  want the parameters to be called just ids as I specified.
[13:02:54] <BillCriswell> clime: So basically like.. ids=1&ids=2 ?
[13:03:05] <clime> BillCriswell: yes
[13:04:56] <BillCriswell> clime: Drawing a blank right now on the exact option but if you do $.ajax({ beforeSend: function(xhr, options){ console.log( options ); }); you should see an option you can may do like option.name.replace('[', ''); etc
[13:06:21] <clime> BillCriswell: ok, so only by hacks...thanks, ill need to change backend then
[13:14:01] <BillCriswell> clime: I've dealt with a system that takes them without the [] as well. It was weird.
[13:14:25] <BillCriswell> Not sure which is the "right way" though.
[13:15:05] <BillCriswell> clime: http://jsfiddle.net/6D9Z2/ for if you say "fuck it".
[13:15:41] <clime> BillCriswell: thx
[13:17:29] <eager> hi all, may I have a question about modernizr? I don't know anyplace better to ask... In a sandbox project, I include a custom build to detect only css transition and svg support.
[13:17:50] <eager> In chrome, I see " js csstransitions svg" classes on the <html> element
[13:18:00] <eager> which is how it is supposed to work
[13:18:54] <eager> however in ie9 I don't see anything of that, I guess because I use this pattern on the <html> element: http://pastie.org/8493728
[13:19:06] <tlee-54321> join #android
[13:19:40] <eager> which is the supposed method to replace conditonal stylesheets
[13:20:38] <eager> now in IE9 i get the "ie9 iexplorer" classes, which is visible where it came from in the conditonal comments section
[13:21:21] <eager> and modernizr is not putting its classes onto _this instance_ of the <html>
[13:21:55] <eager> 1. what am I supposed to do 2. what keyword combo should I google?
[13:24:57] <eager> hm, should I leave that conditional-comment pattern behind, if I want to work with modernizr?
[13:25:23] <eager> html5 boilerplate neither seems to be using it... https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html
[13:25:31] <samhuntley> @eager that makes sense, since it is a different way of thinking about browser compatibility
[13:25:42] <samhuntley> build to features, not to specific browsers
[13:25:49] <eager> ... but I remember as if i have seen them to use that before
[13:26:21] <eager> so I really shouldn't worry for IE8's where JS is disabled, right?
[13:26:44] <eager> (cause that's the place where I couldn't count on modernizr)
[13:27:27] <samhuntley> well, that would be true in all browsers
[13:27:45] <samhuntley> but you know you don't have js, so you can degrade from there at least
[13:27:56] <eager> oh my, trouble
[13:28:24] <eager> i have removed the conditional comment pattern, and now is what i find in ie9:
[13:28:37] <Xal_> I have a function that is running through a bunch of wraps, appends and loads, but after it runs there is no difference in the page. I've checked that elements they are attached to are actually returning something.
[13:28:38] <eager> "blocked active-x content"
[13:29:00] <eager> after I allow that "blocked content" i get the modernizr classes
[13:29:07] <eager> why is it blocked???
[13:29:18] <eager> hm at least something i can now google
[13:30:11] <BlaDe^_> hi.. has anyone worked with flot bars here?
[13:30:14] <samhuntley> I dunno, could it be something else it the page that's keeping it from running js all together?
[13:43:53] <BlaDe^_> Any help with: http://jsfiddle.net/emaM7/ would be appreciated
[13:56:19] <Xal_> There shouldn't be any issue with jquery creating an element inside an element that it had already created, right?
[14:00:50] <joe89> When I add a html 5 music player to my code code that consists of a jquery mobile toolbar the page goes blank and I cant get both the toolbar and the music player to appear. My code is HTML 5 validated and I have no idea how to get both the toolbar and music player to appear at the same time. Can anyone help me? Heres my code:   http://pastebin.com/0tvcutm6
[14:15:27] <hendricius> question: i am getting some fail messages for ajax requests, not sure what is the problem: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gbrlaivp04of8y/Screenshot%202013-11-19%2023.14.44.png
[14:15:31] <hendricius> just says request failed
[14:16:07] <hendricius> nvm
[14:16:09] <hendricius> 404
[14:17:55] <hendricius> hmm well
[14:18:01] <hendricius> no, it does not reach the server logs
[14:18:06] <hendricius> just a fail in the chrome network inspector
[14:25:13] <faddah> hendricius - well, dumb question, i know, but you have it listening on port 3000 - are you certain that is the port you activated for your localhost/javascript web app? just clicking off the troubleshooting checklist.
[14:30:08] <hendricius> faddah: yep. if i open the url http://localhost:3000/preview_ads?website_url=foo.com directly in the browser or via CURL all is correct.
[14:30:23] <petey> Is there anyway to scrape what a user sees on an html page?
[14:30:34] <hendricius> petey: what do you mean?
[14:31:17] <petey> So I have like 1,000 rows on some html page, each row is a client with their name, dev, qa, staged, live site etc
[14:31:23] <saba> http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/attachments-in-gmail-now-with-power-of.html <- This new feature in Gmail, any idea on how they have implemented the print functionality in order to avoid the "prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" alerts?
[14:31:48] <petey> pulling the HTML file, there's literally like 10,000 things per element
[14:31:57] <petey> It's the saddest sight I've ever seen
[14:32:09] <faddah> hendricius - so if i understand it, your jQuery code or app is running ok on port 3000 on localhost, but what you want to see in the log is not happening. do you mean console.log, or a server log that you're writing to from the app?
[14:32:24] <petey> So I was hoping I could just pluck it right off of what the user 'sees'
[14:32:39] <petey> otherwise there is like 15 variables/classes/id's/backend per element
[14:32:44] <hendricius> faddah: yep. the server log has no entries, but it should show all requests arriving. but there are no requests arriving :D it's really weird.
[14:33:33] <faddah> is the server/middleware writing to a db? if so, do those db entries/transactions show up?
[14:33:54] <Velveeta> petey: there's no way to harvest the markup for just the visible elements on a page
[14:34:03] <faddah> pardon, that was for - hendricius - "is the server/middleware writing to a db? if so, do those db entries/transactions show up?"
[14:34:06] <hendricius> faddah: nothing in there. but good point, maybe i need to check the middleware
[14:34:08] <Velveeta> without also getting the markup for crap contained within them
[14:34:25] <faddah> hendricius - tomcat? something else?
[14:34:46] <hendricius> faddah: ruby on rails, webrick server. im checking now
[14:34:48] <petey> Hm okay thanks velveeta
[14:34:59] <faddah> hendricius - o.k.
[14:40:43] <hendricius> faddah: it seems to be a browser problem
[14:40:49] <hendricius> faddah: in private mode it works.
[14:41:40] <faddah> hendricius: interesting. chrome? which OS?
[14:44:08] <hendricius> faddah: OS X
[14:44:25] <hendricius> faddah: found the issue. because there is "ads" in the url, adblock chrome extension blocks it :D
[14:46:38] <faddah> hawr!
[14:48:25] <faddah> hendricius - that's almost as bad as when i spent hours with AppleCare Support on the phone, then had to take my iMac in, because bluetooth to the keyboard and mouse would intermittently cut out and sometimes, not even restarting would cure it. turned out it's because i had spun up a virtual box/vagrant instance to test out doing that, and it was grabbing and holding onto the bluetooth, and restarting with the mac os x each time. d'oh!
[15:13:34] <ServerSage> Hey folks, .blur() in mobile safari doesn't seem to fire when another element is clicked on the page.  Is there a work around I'm not finding in the google box?
[15:18:38] <ServerSage> A better question might be, on the iPad using standard jQuery (not mobile) was is the best way to capture when a user taps on some part of the page, and hopefully the input losing focus?
[16:37:03] <clime> hey, I am learning deferreds and I want to make a jquery plugin for submitting forms by ajax. So far I have got this: http://jsfiddle.net/clime/KL6YQ/1/ The problem is that it works only for the first time. After that the deferred is resolved and I am looking for a way how to "refresh" it.
[17:11:06] <raj> besides unbinding namespaced events, and removing .data() that was associated, anything else I should consider when 'destroying' a plugin?
[17:12:44] <raj> also, if I unbind events on an element, are all events (also bound to that namespace) on child elements unbound?
[17:12:51] <shoky> raj: basically freeing any resource you've allocated ;S
[17:13:06] <shoky> and no
[17:13:12] <shoky> (to your 2nd q)
[17:13:17] <raj> ok
[17:13:26] <raj> what about $(window).unbind('.tooltip')?
[17:13:37] <raj> that gets all the children?
[17:13:43] <shoky> nope
[17:14:06] <raj> so no way to globally unbind a particular namespace from any element it is bound to?
[17:14:16] <raj> *namespaced event
[17:14:50] <shoky> there's no list maintained for you of elements with event listeners attached to
[17:15:11] <shoky> so mmm no. except uhm $('*').unbind.. ;p
[17:15:19] <raj> gotcha
[17:15:31] <raj> ok, guess I'll keep better records
[17:15:47] <shoky> of course, that isn't really relevant if you're delegating events
[17:16:00] <raj> meaning?
[17:16:01] <shoky> cause then there's only an event handler bound to the parent
[17:16:31] <shoky> i mean something like $('body').on('click', '.mybutton', function..)
[17:16:45] <raj> ah, right
[17:16:49] <shoky> there it'd be enough to just do $('body').off
[17:16:51] <raj> so that should be unbound from the parent anyway
[17:16:57] <shoky> yeah
[17:17:22] <raj> gotcha, thanks
[17:18:04] <shoky> can take a look at your plugin if you want me to check about destroying
[17:18:39] <raj> cool, I'll have my go at destroy and then I'll send you
[17:18:39] <shoky> ... and otherwise scrutinize your shitty code <3
[17:18:44] <raj> lmao
[17:18:48] <raj> better get some red bull
[17:18:56] <shoky> ;]
[17:21:17] <raj> I need a better way to namespace these functions
[17:21:23] <raj> and a standard way
[17:21:46] <shoky> better than?
[17:22:47] <raj> better than makeTabs_destroy()
[17:24:31] <shoky> oh, functions
[17:24:45] <shoky> why do you need the namespace there?
[17:25:07] <shoky> that is, you probably don't
[17:35:04] <raj> shoky, so I don't have another function called removeTab()
[17:35:13] <raj> or even makeTabs_removeTab()
[17:37:09] <shoky> wat?
[17:37:18] <shoky> how does removeTab conflict with destroy?
[17:39:50] <raj> i'm giving another example
[17:40:19] <raj> I just don't want other plugins or other code to conflict with my naming
[17:40:26] <raj> is there any way to guarantee that?
[17:40:38] <shoky> ok but why would they? are you putting all these in the global namespace?
[17:40:43] <raj> the way other languages with classes do
[17:40:52] <raj> shoky, yes
[17:41:00] <shoky> what, why
[17:41:16] <shoky> that's a nasty thing for a plugin to do
[17:41:19] <raj> how do I make it not in the global namespace?
[17:41:25] <shoky> put it in a function
[17:42:02] <raj> oh, put it all btwn (function($) {  and   })(jQuery) ?
[17:42:29] <shoky> yes, that's like the first thing any jquery plugin doc says
[17:42:58] <raj> ok, but not within $.fn.makeTabs = functoin(method) {  } ?
[17:43:18] <shoky> i donno, that depends how you wanna use it internally
[17:43:26] <shoky> but..
[17:43:28] <raj> how can I make that decision?
[17:43:34] <shoky> i thought you wanted to follow that plugin doc
[17:43:42] <raj> I do
[17:43:58] <shoky> it doesn't have any such namespaces in function names, i think
[17:44:09] <raj> ok
[17:44:41] <shoky> i can't tell you how to make the decision without seeing the code and knowing what you wanna do exactly with these functions
[17:44:51] <shoky> and by exactly i mean exactly ;p
[17:46:04] <raj> ok, a few more minutes
[17:46:14] <shoky> okidoki
[17:57:28] <saik0> using the jquery validation plugin: when I call $("#myInputField").rules("add", <handler> ) all fields in the form have the rules applied instead of #myInputField
[17:57:39] <saik0> http://jsfiddle.net/v4p65/
[18:08:05] <saik0> found it: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/439

[18:12:13] <TimTim`> anyone know why jquery is appending ?callback=jQuery1234etc to the uri for ajax requests in opera?
[18:12:44] <shoky> TimTim`: it does that for JSONP requests
[18:12:51] <TimTim`> i realize the callback should be added to the response
[18:13:12] <TimTim`> but, why is opera defaulting to jsonp?
[18:13:23] <shoky> uhh are you sure it's just on opera
[18:13:30] <shoky> what exactly is happening
[18:13:41] <TimTim`> it's not doing it on chrome or ff
[18:13:43] <shoky> and show your ajax code
[18:14:36] <TimTim`> i'm attempting to retrieve javascript files via ajax and show them within a web-based text editor
[18:15:39] <TimTim`> so the ajax request looks something like (1 sec)
[18:16:09] <TimTim`> wait i may have found the issue... let me verify
[18:17:38] <TimTim`> oh interesting
[18:17:47] <TimTim`> opera doesn't have window.location.origin
[18:18:00] <louism2wash> hey guys, what would happen if I try to make an AJAX request that the device has no internet connection?
[18:18:02] <louism2wash> a timeout?
[18:18:02] <TimTim`> thanks for the nudge
[18:19:12] <shoky> never heard of window.location.origin
[18:19:25] <shoky> seems chrome and FF only got it recently
[18:20:12] <shoky> louism2wash: a timeout or could also be an immediate fail
[18:20:40] <shoky> well by timeout i mean a connection timeout, not a timeout set by jquery
[18:20:58] <shoky> so if you want a sure timeout, add one to the ajax options
[18:21:05] <louism2wash> shoky: in the case of a connection timeout… how would that issue surface itself?  How can I catch that?
[18:21:32] <shoky> louism2wash: as an error status of the ajax request. it'll trigger the error handler
[18:22:31] <louism2wash> shoky: so if I have have a function specified in the error callback it will get ran in the case of a connection timeout?
[18:22:45] <louism2wash> shoky: thanks for the help by the way
[18:23:02] <shoky> louism2wash: i believe so
[18:23:09] <shoky> but a connection timeout could take a while
[18:28:56] <sammych> okay, I might be asking for something that isn't in the use case
[18:29:01] <sammych> jQuery Movbile
[18:29:08] <sammych> jQuery Mobile
[18:29:11] <louism2wash> shoky: I think it's somewhere between 30 seconds or 1 minute
[18:29:37] <sammych> I have a popup form. And I want to add tooltip(s) to it for user help
[18:29:42] <louism2wash> shoky: timeout length that is
[18:29:55] <sammych> problem is, can't open a popup inside a popup
[18:31:08] <sammych> guess I'll just have to stick it in a div below the form, or something
[18:37:03] <Snowleaksange> does this code work for anyone https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=171160.0
[18:37:08] <Snowleaksange> everyone sees these consoles logs but me
[18:37:13] <Snowleaksange> i just see Connected. and it just sits there
[18:37:35] <Snowleaksange> would the fact that im loading file://test.html affect it?
[18:37:43] <Snowleaksange> how the hell are you supposed to debug javascript heh
[18:38:52] <ahhughes> by hell you mean IE < 10?
[18:40:01] <ahhughes> Snowleaksange: are you familure with FireBug or Chrome Developer tools? if not, you need to be.
[18:40:17] <Snowleaksange> im using chrome with javascript console
[18:42:19] <Snowleaksange> only thing i know to do is starting using netcat, get a working version, and then figure out how im supposed to translate that into jsquery
[18:42:56] <Snowleaksange> hm i guess i could sniff the data
[18:44:17] <Snowleaksange> this guys code works perfectly http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/
[18:44:55] <Snowleaksange> pretty amazing that given the obfuscated source code, and a bunch of info from the web, i cant achieve an actual response from server (tho i can connect!)
[18:47:26] <Snowleaksange> pretty strong evidence of ultimate levels of js/jquery suckage
[19:01:36] <Snowleaksange> hmm actually it does work.  just takes a really long time
[19:03:11] <Snowleaksange> http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/14182/mtgox-streaming-api-not-receiving-messages
[19:03:12] <Snowleaksange> hmm
[19:11:56] <Tingle2> I have a weird issue in chrome, Im using a plugin to style dropdown menu's, I currently have 6 visible, the first one on the top of my screen is fine, but the other 5 load/transform and then after like 100ms the changes revert and the they are normal select tags again with no other markup around them, as if nothing ever happend. Anyone know why something like this happens? it works fine in IE and FF, im using jquery.selectric
[19:30:46] <louism2wash> Hey guys, if I bind an event listener to a dom element and then remove that element from the page using $(dom_obj).remove() will that event listener leak memory or is jquery smart enough to kill that listener?
[19:32:01] <GreenJello> Hello, I don't have a question about jQuery, I'm just wondering how often people are here, and if most of the users are on around a specific time.  I'm often in ##javascript, and we refer people here, but I don't want to do so when someone isn't likely to be available.
[19:35:35] <BillCriswell> GreenJello: I think it's most active during the day.
