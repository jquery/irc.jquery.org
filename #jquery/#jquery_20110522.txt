[00:13:17] <Matth1a3> how can I test if jquery.jqdock.js is being loaded? I am very new to javascript/jQuery
[00:16:37] <TonkaTruck> matt
[00:16:56] <TonkaTruck> Matth1a3: Sorry.  in your console run $.fn.jqDock
[00:17:21] <TonkaTruck> If you get undefined it hasn't been added to jquery.
[00:19:07] <Matth1a3> TonkaTruck: no idea how to work with jquery in a console. I am loading the jquery script, and another within a .html file. Is there any easy way to test if the script loaded? Maybe with typeof?
[00:19:31] <TonkaTruck> Matth1a3: It's ok.  What browser are you working in?
[00:19:41] <Matth1a3> TonkaTruck: chrome
[00:20:35] <djQuery> Matth1a3: http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/videos.html
[00:20:46] <Matth1a3> TonkaTruck: if the file appears in resources, under developer tools, does that mean it has loaded for the page?
[00:20:53] <Matth1a3> TonkaTruck: oh ok will have a look
[00:21:16] <TonkaTruck> Matth1a3: Go to View > Developer > Javascript console
[00:21:21] <djQuery> this one is cool http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7sJbyXHuk&feature=player_embedded
[00:21:54] <Matth1a3> TonkaTruck:  ok thank you
[00:22:10] <TonkaTruck> I only work in firefox with firebug...then I periodically try it in safari and chrome.
[00:28:28] <gnarf> i really like chrome more nowadays
[00:28:39] <gnarf> after watching some of the paul irish chrome devtools things out there
[00:28:55] <gnarf> there are a lot of useful things in webkit inspector in chrome
[00:29:00] <TonkaTruck> pff isn't he a google employee?
[00:29:49] <TonkaTruck> No...I really have no idea.  I haven't used chrome since arcade fire made that fancy website about remembering-childhood.
[00:32:13] <coldhead> http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[00:32:24] <coldhead> that would make anyone favour chrome
[00:32:29] <coldhead> whatever their sexuality
[00:34:18] <shawndellysse> I'm trying to convert a string that contains a UTC datetime and I'm not getting the expected results.
[00:34:18] <Iszak> mehh
[00:34:21] <shawndellysse> Anyone care to take a look? http://pastebin.com/VS59gWz4
[00:34:45] <Jester831> yea, i love chrome dev tools
[00:34:56] <juha___> i love delicious cake
[00:35:05] <djQuery> great now I'm all hot and bothered
[00:35:44] <Jester831> don't jip now
[00:36:11] <Jester831> so, thoughts anyone on using jsshell to auto insert items into the clipboard?
[00:36:44] <Jester831> I'm not sure if it's possible to interact w/ the clipboard without flash, so dunno
[00:37:02] <djQuery> ie yes others flash
[00:37:18] <djQuery> and even ie has security prompts etc
[00:40:03] <Jester831> ok, then that brings up two other issues: 1. know any that can be called directly? and 2. that are freely hosted
[00:40:39] <wkmanire> It's 00:40. Do you know where your web dev is?
[00:44:32] <wkmanire> coldhead: You said you use coffee script mode
[00:44:38] <wkmanire> to write coffee script or to write javascript?
[00:44:40] <progrock> Well, been emssing around with javascript animatiosn for ~2 hours... hardly a finished product, but what do you guys think: http://www.bobmonteverde.com/
[00:45:18] <wkmanire> progrock: Thats pretty fancy.
[00:45:57] <dxgriffiths> progrock: Nice. The menu item transitions could afford to be faster I think.
[00:46:01] <progrock> lol... literally jsut spent 2 hours messing around, attempting to get something decent with no graphics (obvious I'm not caring much ebtter IE)
[00:46:06] <progrock> about*
[00:47:01] <wkmanire> progrock: Thats the funny thing about artsy stuff. You spent 2 hours tweaking that, but if you had to do it again or something similar it would probably take 30 to 45 minutes
[00:47:03] <progrock> dxgriffiths: true, I havent twaked anything... but will definite take note... just got my basic stuff down.. and a slight 'proof of concept' with one of the functions
[00:47:04] <wkmanire> am I right? :D
[00:47:14] <dxgriffiths> progrock: :)
[00:47:27] <progrock> wkmanire:everythigns calcualted.. I could do it for a didfferent site in 1 minute
[00:47:35] <wkmanire> nice
[00:47:56] <progrock> if you look at the inline javascript.. theres ettings that sets the text.. then the box and shit is all sized from the text
[00:48:43] <wkmanire> progrock: In a sec, I'm busy using the 2010 Sharks to beat up the Redwings.
[00:48:59] <gnarf> Jester831: css3please has a to clipboard option - you could probably figure out how they did it ;)
[00:49:00] <progrock> I gotta go fix my 'calcFontSize' tho.. meses up in Firefox (cant say I did much testing, yet..)
[00:49:06] <coldhead> wkmanire: to write coffeescript
[00:49:36] <progrock> wkmanire: no need... its jsut "TITLE = "Bob Mon...." and "MENU = [ 'projects', ...] )   nothign interesting
[00:49:56] <progrock> jsut saying its all automatic from there
[00:49:58] <wkmanire> coldhead: :( I want to be satisfied with my emacs javascript mode
[00:49:59] <Jester831> yup, @gnarf looks like zeroclipboard
[00:50:11] <wkmanire> I'm gonna have to break down and learn lisp eventually.
[00:50:19] <progrock> hmm, if I'm not mistaken coffee script gets rid of the 'var' keyword, whcih royally screws up scoping (unless I'm mistaken).. seems really stupid to me
[00:50:40] <TC_> $(window).scrollTop($(window).prop('scrollHeight'));  < This won't work.
[00:50:47] <TC_> neither would $(document)
[00:53:55] <juha___> http://imgur.com/gallery/RVn8S awesome!
[00:55:39] <sv_in> TC_, what do you want to do
[00:56:26] <sv_in> Sorry, I came late. don't know what the first part of your question was
[00:57:46] <coldhead> wkmanire: lets have a look at js2 mode this week if you have some time
[00:58:29] <TC_> no worries, I did an alternative method with a div.
[00:58:32] <wkmanire> coldhead: sounds good.
[00:58:45] <wkmanire> coldhead: I can read lisp, but I've never written anything serious with it.
[00:58:45] <wkmanire> you?
[00:58:46] <Lampoon> you are a gobshite
[00:58:58] <coldhead> lol Lampoon
[00:59:15] <coldhead> i'm pretty happy with lisp
[00:59:31] <coldhead> mostly i want to pick your brain on how it should work
[00:59:32] <TC_> I was in here yesterday, but I'll repeat a problem - setTimeout/setInterval will occasionally stop working. It's not a maximum number of requests - considering my host doesn't have one.
[00:59:35] <TC_> It's not a process limit.
[00:59:40] <coldhead> the mode should*
[00:59:44] <TC_> it's not me with a shitty computer.
[00:59:57] <TC_> JS doesn't stop, just the setTimeout/setInterval's
[01:00:11] <wkmanire> I can sum that up pretty succintly in a pastebin
[01:00:11] <wkmanire> just a sec
[01:03:46] <JackJack> Anyone here use mirc and know how to turn off that shitty sidebar?
[01:06:17] <wkmanire> coldhead: http://imageshack.us/f/835/screenshotemq.png/
[01:06:20] <wkmanire> I decided to use a screenshot instead
[01:07:05] <wkmanire> coldhead: You can make the formatting slightly more bearable by just putting function declarations on new lines.
[01:07:27] <TC_> ugly...
[01:07:29] <wkmanire> But working on jQuery from the github and maintaining the style guideline is pretty hard
[01:07:54] <TC_> but does anyone know the problem with my setTimeout/setInterval? I cannot find ANYTHING on google.
[01:08:35] <progrock> man, I feelliek my css webfonts are 'optimized' to not lock everythign else till they load... but in fact, I NEED them to lock everything until they load
[01:08:36] <wkmanire> TC_: Didn't see your question.
[01:08:40] <wkmanire> Whats the problem?
[01:09:22] <TC_> I was in here yesterday, but I'll repeat a problem - setTimeout/setInterval will occasionally stop working. It's not a maximum number of requests - considering my host doesn't have one. It's not a process limit, or a shitty computer. JS doesn't stop, it's just the setTimeout/setInterval.
[01:09:35] <TC_> Worst part is, I'm trying to duplicate the issue in a test, but without knowing what is causing it...
[01:09:51] <wkmanire> So your callbacks do not fire when expected?
[01:10:21] <TC_> if I'm understandin whaty ou mean by "callbacks" - well they don't fire AT ALL when expected.
[01:10:33] <TC_> Sometimes it may stop after a few seconds, sometimes it'll last.. minutes, sometimes... for a very long time.
[01:10:36] <TC_> It's random >.<
[01:10:49] <TC_> Seems to be the same code on another server seems to work quite nicely.
[01:10:53] <wkmanire> Are you able to make it happen in jsFiddle?
[01:11:04] <TC_> well I'm trying to make it happen on a test right now.
[01:11:07] <wkmanire> Or is it only in the context of your code/site?
[01:11:19] <TC_> but this one's been running ... 30 minutes and no issue.
[01:11:26] <TC_> it's what makes it so tricky.
[01:12:26] <wkmanire> What are you doing inside of the timeout callback functions?
[01:12:36] <TC_> hum... I'll post my code.
[01:13:00] <TC_> I am like... using $.ajax though
[01:13:15] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/hHW99VXy
[01:13:18] <TC_> but nothin extensive.
[01:13:29] <TC_> no error logs get generated by php/mysql
[01:13:40] <notbrent> how do I perform an action once a form has successfully been submitted, in order to disable form elements? if I disable them in $("form").submit( .. ) it does not submit properly
[01:14:50] <Jester831> !seen sacback
[01:15:11] <wkmanire> It seems unlikely that your server is taking more than 1000ms to return.
[01:15:17] <wkmanire> but have you verified that?
[01:15:59] <Jester831> notbrent; serialize and post the data on submit, then return false
[01:16:32] <Jester831> and use ajax successful
[01:16:44] <TC_> it's just.. stopping completely. It never ever starts again. I know sometimes it may... lag a little - that's obvious but...
[01:16:48] <TC_> it just never carries on
[01:16:55] <TC_> you can wait 30 minutes after it stopping and still doesn't continue.
[01:16:56] <TC_> that's not right.
[01:17:04] <TC_> you need to refresh and it works fine again
[01:17:09] <Kambfhase> TC_: are you sure that all you ajax call always succeed?
[01:17:25] <TC_> possible they may not...
[01:17:27] <TC_> how would I check?
[01:17:32] <TC_> they should succeed but yeah
[01:17:33] <Kambfhase> btw, why does you javascript start with ; ?
[01:17:37] <Jester831> use google chrome and monitor posts
[01:17:56] <Jester831> chrome dev tools => network
[01:17:59] <Kambfhase> in firebug ajaxcalls that do not succeed show up red.
[01:18:03] <wkmanire> Kambfhase: That has no ill effects.
[01:18:17] <notbrent> Jester381: thanks dude
[01:18:20] <wkmanire> the ; is just going to be executed as a statement yielding undefined.
[01:18:27] <Jester831> yup
[01:18:30] <wkmanire> coldhead: Did you get my screenshot?
[01:18:32] <Kambfhase> wkmanire: thats why i am asking
[01:19:04] <gnarf> Kambfhase: in case the script before you in the concated files didn't have a ; at the end?
[01:19:05] <wkmanire> TC_: add callbacks for error and done.
[01:19:24] <wkmanire> TC_: throw exceptions in them
[01:19:29] <wkmanire> or better yet set breakpoints in them
[01:19:34] <TC_> error: function() { something here } ?
[01:19:45] <wkmanire> yep
[01:20:33] <coldhead> wkmanire: the one on the right is how you want it?
[01:20:34] <Kambfhase> gnarf: oh yeah, and uglify omits the very last ; too iirc
[01:20:41] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[01:20:42] <bot-t> Not much dude, jusâ€™ hanginâ€™ â€™nâ€™ chillinâ€™
[01:20:43] <TC_> http://www.horble.com/tests/?speed=1000 this test stopped. but it NEVER happens often...
[01:20:44] <wkmanire> coldhead: I would assum that is more inline.
[01:20:48] <wkmanire> bot-t: Where you been boy?
[01:20:49] <bot-t> wkmanire, Yes - definitely.
[01:20:49] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[01:20:50] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[01:21:11] <coldhead> wkmanire: so you want less indenting, not relative indenting?
[01:21:13] <wkmanire> coldhead: assume*,... more inline with what people are doing these days.
[01:21:40] <wkmanire> Yeah, and also it should always use tabs or always use spaces.
[01:21:42] <TC_> I stuck in error:
[01:21:44] <wkmanire> but it should not mix them
[01:21:49] <TC_> with an alert, and the settimeout only occurs in success.
[01:22:10] <TC_> so if it did error, it wouldnt' actually do any more alerts. so I'm hoping that's what is happening
[01:22:11] <wkmanire> coldhead: basically it seems to not matter what you but in tab-width.
[01:22:13] <TC_> i mean, anymore timeouts
[01:22:16] <notbrent> Jester381: this won't work on an external url will it?
[01:22:27] <notbrent> i'm using it to submit to a google doc
[01:22:28] <coldhead> that shouldn't be too hard to fix
[01:22:32] <wkmanire> put*
[01:23:14] <TC_> I'm hopin that test doesn't burn out my cpu actually.
[01:23:17] <wkmanire> coldhead: I think the indenting rules will be kind of hard because { usually means start of a block.
[01:23:37] <wkmanire> coldhead: So its probably "looking at" { and saying ok next tab stop.
[01:23:52] <TC_> Yeah, it's stopped.
[01:23:57] <TC_> oh nevermind
[01:23:58] <TC_> it carried on
[01:24:35] <TC_> wait..
[01:24:39] <TC_> I think it restarted
[01:25:34] <coldhead> wkmanire: it's counting the characters instead of the number of indent levels
[01:25:39] <wkmanire> coldhead: next tab stop from where the function was keyword started instead of ntext tab stop from the previous
[01:25:53] <wkmanire> bleh, from where the function keyword was started*
[01:25:57] <wkmanire> coldhead: ah, that makes sense.
[01:26:20] <coldhead> so unless it's terribly fucked up i bet it's fixable
[01:26:53] <notbrent> Jester831: my bad, got it working..
[01:27:09] <Jester831> ok?
[01:28:04] <dr0id> http://cdn.zedomax.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/super-mario.jpeg
[01:29:23] <wkmanire> coldhead: I've looked at the code once or twice before, but I just don't have the experience with lisp or lisp like languages to recognize if it was well or poorly organized.
[01:29:49] <wkmanire> coldhead: my first impression was that the code was a modified C style major mode but kind of all over the place.
[01:31:07] <TC_> saying that, that test doesn't work properly - even with a setTimeout of 5 seconds, it still doens't slow it down lmao
[01:32:41] <wkmanire> TC_: Try mocking setTimeout so you can take the waiting and it out of the equation.
[01:33:07] <TC_> what do you mean?
[01:33:17] <wkmanire> TC_: It will run your scripts synchronously but maybe being able to run 10000 iterations in succession will help you identify the problem.
[01:33:41] <TC_> Sorry I still dont' understand ><
[01:34:15] <wkmanire> var mySetTimeout = function (callback, time) { callback.call(window); };
[01:34:16] <wkmanire> or something like that.
[01:34:37] <wkmanire> if you want a delay, then take a timestamp and start a loop that waits.
[01:34:43] <wkmanire> n milliseconds.
[01:36:49] <TC_> var mySetTimeout = function (callback, <?=$_GET['speed']?>) { callback.call(window); };
[01:36:52] <TC_> just this a lone? becauae it dont' work
[01:37:05] <wkmanire> why even bother with the PHP?
[01:37:07] <wkmanire> this is a javascript problem
[01:38:59] <TC_> var mySetTimeout = function (callback, 1000) { callback.call(window); };
[01:39:04] <TC_> unexpecteed number
[01:39:06] <TC_> >.<
[01:39:16] <TC_> even tried "1000"
[01:39:21] <wkmanire> TC_: :(
[01:39:41] <wkmanire> TC_: you are declaring an anonymous function and assigning it to the variable mySettimeOut.
[01:39:48] <wkmanire> which means that all arguments specified must be valid variable names.
[01:39:54] <wkmanire> the number 1000 is unexpected.
[01:40:10] <TC_> so how do I call it?
[01:40:58] <wkmanire> var mySetTimeout = function (callback, delay) { callback.call(window); }; /* later on... */ mySetTimeout(doThisLater, 100);
[01:41:10] <gnarf> TC_: function( callback ) { setTimeout( callback, 1000 ); }
[01:41:43] <TC_> thats pretty much what I already do gnarf...
[01:41:43] <TC_> o.O
[01:41:44] <wkmanire> gnarf: He's have a race issue I think, I asked him to mock setTimeout and run his code synchronously to try to catch the problem.
[01:41:48] <wkmanire> having*
[01:42:07] <TC_> what is ... callback ?
[01:42:10] <gnarf> window.setTimeout = function( callback ) { callback.call(window); } ???
[01:42:31] <wkmanire> sure, he could duck punch it.
[01:42:34] <wkmanire> Or monkey slap it.
[01:42:36] <wkmanire> :D
[01:42:42] <wkmanire> monkey patch bonk
[01:43:01] <gnarf> whatever, see ?glwt ;) -- I'm out
[01:43:01] <Whirl3d> is there a firebug equivalent in IE?

[01:48:09] <TC_> how woudl I put the delay in :P
[01:48:28] <wkmanire> TC_: Take a timestamp and run a while loop until the timestamp has changed by the desired amount.
[01:48:44] <TC_> uh...
[01:49:10] <wkmanire> Hold on a sec TC_, I'll set up a fiddle for you

[01:54:57] <TC_> whats the spni cycle bit?
[01:55:03] <wkmanire> A comment
[01:55:20] <wkmanire> its meaningless
[01:55:29] <ravenzz> hello folks
[01:55:41] <wkmanire> just a joke alluding to one of the cycles a washing machine does when it is operating.
[01:56:05] <wkmanire> ravenzz: Welcome.... to zombocom
[01:57:46] <TC_> jesus christ wkmarnire.
[01:57:49] <TC_> that crashes my browser.
[01:57:51] <TC_> >.<
[01:58:08] <wkmanire> Really?
[01:58:20] <Kambfhase> pwnd
[01:58:20] <wkmanire> It has the potential to if you set a very long delay.
[01:58:31] <wkmanire> It makes the browser unresponsivle.
[01:58:34] <Kambfhase> your browser has just be partured
[01:58:35] <wkmanire> unresponsive*
[01:58:50] <Kambfhase> *raptured damn
[01:58:52] <wkmanire> so your delay should be very short. Just a little bit longer than your average network latency.
[01:59:32] <TC_> http://www.horble.com/tests/ it's a 500 delay...
[01:59:40] <TC_> that's... 0.5 seconds, right?
[01:59:52] <wkmanire> which browser are you using?
[02:00:03] <wkmanire> because it is running fine in chrome
[02:00:07] <TC_> firefox
[02:00:23] <wkmanire> that date subtraction bit my not work in FF
[02:00:26] <wkmanire> I honestly didn't test it.
[02:00:34] <ravenzz> urbandictionary doesn't work, zombocom? :d
[02:01:10] <TC_> ooolala
[02:01:14] <TC_> it popped up with my alert.
[02:01:18] <TC_> "An error occured, terminating"
[02:01:18] <wkmanire> ravenzz: http://www.zombo.com/
[02:01:25] <wkmanire> ravenzz: ancient internet lore
[02:01:37] <TC_> I put it in chrome that was.
[02:01:45] <TC_> so it errored, for some strange reason? why would it error
[02:01:59] <wkmanire> generally its caused by a response from the server.
[02:02:09] <TC_> a response?
[02:02:11] <wkmanire> Check the XHR argument in the error callback and see what the erver status code was
[02:02:18] <wkmanire> server*
[02:02:24] <TC_> uh...
[02:02:28] <TC_> that sounds more complicated than the callbacks
[02:02:38] <wkmanire> TC_: You've have to get some basic vocabulary down here.
[02:02:42] <wkmanire> You have*
[02:02:46] <wkmanire> and me too
[02:02:49] <TC_> Yes, I do :P
[02:02:51] <wkmanire> Such as English contractions
[02:03:07] <ravenzz> anything is possible here
[02:03:32] <wkmanire> We're talking about server/client paradigm.
[02:03:40] <TC_> My grammar and other things seems pretty good compare to others, but my vocab and terminology sucks. Even though I'm pure English.
[02:03:52] <ravenzz> lol
[02:03:59] <wkmanire> The client (your browser) makes a request to the server at a URL.
[02:04:06] <ravenzz> TC_ is talking about technical skills
[02:04:18] <wkmanire> The request is a bunch of text asking for some resource from the server.
[02:04:21] <ravenzz> not English grammar e Co
[02:04:27] <wkmanire> the server will consider the request and form a response
[02:04:30] <TC_> then again, my chat script stopped working and never alerted >.< damnit.
[02:04:38] <wkmanire> which is a bunch of text that is sent back to the client.
[02:04:51] <wkmanire> One bit of information in the response is a status code.
[02:04:55] <Dirkos> Im using this jquery thing... but is it also possible to let the menu open to the TOP? Since it is in an iframe
[02:04:55] <Dirkos> http://javascript-array.com/scripts/jquery_simple_drop_down_menu/
[02:05:01] <wkmanire> One status code you are already familiar with is 404
[02:05:15] <wkmanire> 500 is generally something wrong happening on your server.
[02:05:21] <wkmanire> that is what I am looking for.
[02:05:31] <TC_> yeah I'm familiar iwth 404.
[02:05:39] <TC_> How do I check the status code or whatever though?
[02:06:01] <wkmanire> A callback is a method that is passed as an argument to another method to be executed after some work is completed.
[02:06:20] <wkmanire> In this case success and error are both callbacks that are provided to the .ajax function to be called depending on the result of your ajax request.
[02:06:31] <wkmanire> One of the arguments that is provided to your callbacks is the XHR object.
[02:06:43] <wkmanire> XMLHttpRequest objec that was created to make the request.
[02:06:49] <wkmanire> One of the properties of that XHR object is the status code.
[02:07:02] <wkmanire> Please take a moment to read the documentation for $.ajax at jquery.com.
[02:07:03] <ravenzz> TC_ http://tutorialzine.com/2010/10/ajax-web-chat-css-jquery/
[02:07:33] <wkmanire> pay attention to the success, error and done callback method signatures
[02:08:20] <wkmanire> If the status code response from the server is anything but 200 (or 304 I believe) your error: callback will always be executed.
[02:08:33] <wkmanire> The done callback is always executed no matter what.
[02:09:32] <TC_> window.XMLHttpRequest.status ?
[02:09:45] <wkmanire> nope
[02:09:50] <TC_> close?
[02:10:00] <wkmanire> I want the status from the XHR argument in your error callback
[02:12:46] <TC_> var jqxhr = $.ajax({ ...
[02:12:48] <TC_> jqxhr.complete(function(){ alert(jqxhr.status); });
[02:12:53] <TC_> but that'll popup even on errors?
[02:12:58] * TC_ is confused
[02:13:02] <wkmanire> Instead of using alert
[02:13:05] <wkmanire> Use console.log
[02:13:11] <wkmanire> it won't stop your application.
[02:13:45] <TC_> oh i got an idea.
[02:13:57] <TC_> error: function(xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError)
[02:14:26] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ TC_
[02:14:26] <TC_> I don't know how consoles work. >.<
[02:14:26] <bot-t> TC_, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[02:14:54] <wkmanire> complete: function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) { console.log(jqXHR.status); }
[02:15:02] <wkmanire> or success: rather
[02:16:32] <TC_> I am receiving: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined in my log lmao
[02:17:28] <wkmanire> TC_: You should really consider putting this project on hold and hitting the books.
[02:17:47] <TC_> and end up homeless? Me no think so :(
[02:18:04] <TC_> I'm more for PHP but with a social network...
[02:18:13] <TC_> it's kinda a requirement to have some form of relatively instant chat.
[02:18:27] <wkmanire> Sorry
[02:18:32] <wkmanire> Didn't realize this was for your job
[02:18:40] <TC_> Well it's not.
[02:18:42] <TC_> It's...
[02:18:46] <TC_> well I aim to make money from it
[02:18:56] <TC_> so I can actually gain a life again.
[02:18:59] <MatthiasVance`> A good preparation is half the work.
[02:19:08] <wkmanire> You have a lot of holes to fill in your understanding of the web platform.
[02:19:29] <wkmanire> As well as how to effectively debug your javascripts.
[02:20:17] <TC_> well oftenly chrome will point out an error in the code, I work with that but that's all.
[02:20:20] <wkmanire> TC_Ã‡ http://eloquentjavascript.net/ start here.
[02:20:27] <TC_> but they havea consoel section too so I'm looking at that.
[02:20:37] <wkmanire> TC_: That book is free and it is good.
[02:20:52] <wkmanire> TC_: Then watch paul irish's talk on chrome developer tools.
[02:20:59] <TC_> a free book for $18 ?
[02:21:22] <wkmanire> And read the docs on it. You need to learn how to set breakpoints and step through your code.
[02:21:22] <wkmanire> http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[02:21:28] <wkmanire> also how to write stuff to the log.
[02:21:36] <wkmanire> Anonymous function syntax.
[02:21:43] <wkmanire> client/server communications.
[02:26:52] <TC_> I've been having this problem for over a year. Obviously I gave up since then and started back many many times.
[02:27:09] <TC_> I'll read as much as I can but I do need this done asap.
[02:27:47] <TC_> so far it's gone through 1k times... and throwing up that many "Cannot call method 'call' of undefined" issues
[02:27:56] <wkmanire> TC_: I'm not asking you to stop asking questions. :)
[02:28:07] <wkmanire> Can I see the page that is throwing that exception?
[02:28:12] <wkmanire> do you have a live link?
[02:28:15] <TC_> http://www.horble.com/tests/
[02:28:57] <wkmanire> TC_: Ok, I found the problem
[02:29:09] <wkmanire> The way I found it, is I opened up chrome
[02:29:13] <wkmanire> went to line 17 of the script
[02:29:15] <wkmanire> and set a breakpoint there.
[02:29:22] <wkmanire> When it tripped, I looked at the callstack
[02:29:33] <wkmanire> and went up to the anonymous success callback function.
[02:29:40] <wkmanire> It took me to line 31
[02:29:43] <wkmanire> where you have this line
[02:29:53] <wkmanire> mySetTimeout(test(myvar + 1), 500);
[02:30:33] <wkmanire> What that is expressing is this "Take the return value of test(myvar + 1) and pass it as the first argument to mySetTimeout)
[02:30:54] <TC_> that sounds messy.
[02:30:59] <wkmanire> So that return value doesn't have a call property on it, which is why you are getting that exception.
[02:31:20] <TC_> but I can haev a var myvar = 1; and myvar++ in the callback function thing.
[02:31:23] <wkmanire> Although I doubt this is what you want, to properly express that intent you would write the cod elike this.
[02:31:44] <wkmanire> mySetTimeout(function() {test(myvar + 1)}, 500);
[02:31:49] <TC_> oh.
[02:32:22] <TC_> yeah I've done things like that before, but I never really understood why.
[02:33:01] <TC_> that works, just waiting on an error now - as for my chat script, it still produced no error but I'll put it into chrome, and seei f anything spits out in the log
[02:33:11] <wkmanire> ok
[02:36:59] <TC_> yeah firebug does the status codes automatically doo.
[02:37:00] <TC_> too*
[02:37:06] <TC_> just watching it go through as it spits out 200 each time
[02:37:16] <TC_> it shouldn't repeat the process when an error occurs.
[02:37:19] <TC_> so i'll see the last one
[02:38:33] <TC_> what about if it didn't error though
[02:38:36] <TC_> ?
[02:38:47] <TC_> would that be possible that it's somethin else.
[02:39:19] <wkmanire> I haven't read all of your source so I can't really guess.
[02:40:57] <m0dmd> hey everyon.
[02:41:11] <wkmanire> howdy
[02:41:14] <m0dmd> willdayble
[02:41:16] <m0dmd> sup sup
[02:45:30] <m0dmd> Would anyone recommend this -> http://developwithstyle.com/articles/2010/05/14/jquery-ui-autocomplete-is-it-any-good.html
[02:46:02] <m0dmd> I basically want very fast autocomplete drop downs and I'm assuming that caching will help with that.
[02:46:06] <m0dmd> Is this correct?
[02:46:11] <wkmanire> TC_: I've gotta hit the sack. Almost 3am. I'll be back on later today. good luck.
[02:46:19] <TC_> pokay thanks.
[02:46:20] <m0dmd> wkmanire nite
[02:46:24] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Caching is a good idea yes
[02:46:32] <m0dmd> wkmanire before u hit the sac
[02:46:37] <m0dmd> i want to as well :)
[02:46:50] <m0dmd> can you point me in a direction if you think that site
[02:46:56] <m0dmd> is not worthy
[02:47:56] <wkmanire> ok, my thoughts
[02:48:09] <wkmanire> Keeping a hash for every full keyword doesn't really help you
[02:48:22] <wkmanire> Depending on how you are autocompleting
[02:48:44] <wkmanire> if you put in "dog cat" and cache the results of that query, you might also get stuff that is used for "dog"
[02:48:47] <wkmanire> by itself right?
[02:49:08] <m0dmd> yea but I think the guys last comment fixes that issue
[02:49:43] <m0dmd> and i don't want to store hash I just want to get
[02:49:54] <m0dmd> basic caching for let's say a simple music search
[02:49:57] <wkmanire> Seems reasonable.
[02:50:13] <m0dmd> songTitle, songArtist
[02:50:30] <wkmanire> Still, if you are able to return the term that matched on your search in your DB and store your cache with mappings based on those terms you can probably be more efficient.
[02:50:57] <wkmanire> You can also consider using local storage and timestamping your autocomplete data.
[02:51:01] <m0dmd> actually
[02:51:05] <m0dmd> songArtist
[02:51:06] <wkmanire> that way you don't have to go to the server if the data has already been downloaded once.
[02:51:25] <m0dmd> Alright.
[02:51:28] <palhmbs> I've got another jquery problem, I want to show a <a href> using jquery when the person hits the add to cart button - currently the add to cart button is displaying a nice little spinning gif, using  jQuery('div.dpsc_update_icon', jQuery(this)).css('display', 'inline');
[02:51:34] <m0dmd> So what I'll do is start with the basic autocomplete
[02:51:42] <m0dmd> and play with caching and jqxhr from there
[02:51:45] <palhmbs> the a href is the link to the checkout...
[02:52:01] <wkmanire> m0dmd: good idea, you have a lot of options for optimization, just feel it out and see how far you need to take it.
[02:52:10] <wkmanire> m0dmd: premature optimization is the devil.
[02:52:15] <palhmbs> it's currently display: none - so I'm trying to toggle it with jQuery('a#checkout_button', jQuery(this)).css('display', 'block');
[02:52:16] <wkmanire> m0dmd: I'm really going now.
[02:52:21] <m0dmd> wkmanire nite buddy
[02:52:22] <m0dmd> much thanx
[02:52:25] <wkmanire> no prob
[02:52:32] <palhmbs> is that correct way to go about this?
[02:53:05] <ravenzz> jQuery('a#checkout_button').show()
[02:54:00] <TC_> looking at freenode, the php file (i think) has an infinite loop to check for a new message rather than relying on JS to do it all.
[02:54:26] <palhmbs> ravenzz, thanks very much, works perfectly!
[03:00:45] <SuperRoach> anyone ever used any marquee plugins for tickers etc? if so, what do you recommend
[03:11:01] <Whirl3d> Hey all, what do you do when you have to scroll a div that you don't know the size of? is an explicitly declared height required to use scroll?
[03:11:37] <Whirl3d> wow. It's been 10 minutes since the last post. Weird.
[03:16:08] <ravenzz> if you haven't any fixed height it will fill all the page
[03:16:43] <Whirl3d> So I have to have fixed height in the scrollable div? (thanx for the reply)
[03:17:02] <TC_> ya
[03:17:03] <ravenzz> yes
[03:17:11] <Whirl3d> blech!
[03:17:41] <TC_> no-height is equivalent to a liquid height.
[03:17:43] <TC_> it'll just...
[03:17:45] <Whirl3d> add another six hours of strugglin' with page-resize algorhythms to accommodate scrolling.
[03:17:46] <TC_> get bigger and bigger
[03:18:13] <Whirl3d> thanks for the help.
[03:19:39] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/ky3CG/
[03:20:18] <ravenzz> Whirl3d nah that's quite simple to do
[03:20:37] <TC_> I HAVE A RESULT.
[03:20:43] <ravenzz> 10 minutes is good enought
[03:20:46] <TC_> 500 /tests/:38error /tests/:39Internal Server Error
[03:20:55] <TC_> Finally got one.
[03:23:50] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, I wish it was that simple. I am loading content into a div that floats inside another div that is dynamically positioned on the page. There are about 5 elements that have to be considered to determine how big to make the "scrollable" area if I have to declare it explicitly. It's gonna suck.
[03:27:05] <TC_> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew http://vvcap.net/db/AWXxVfJb1a_h6rRE_Sgd.htp
[03:27:06] <TC_> but how to fix
[03:29:32] <Kambfhase> is that url correct?
[03:33:29] <hendrikadriaanbo> Hi, when i append a text to a div its alright. But why cant i see the text i appended in the sourcode of the document ?
[03:34:26] <Kambfhase> hendrikadriaanbo: the source code just shows the document you loaded from the server
[03:34:42] <hendrikadriaanbo> Can this be changed ?
[03:35:10] <Kambfhase> which broser do you use to develop?
[03:35:10] <levu> is there a alternative to foo.is("a") to check if it's a link?
[03:35:16] <hendrikadriaanbo> safari
[03:35:28] <hendrikadriaanbo> and firefox
[03:35:47] <Kambfhase> hendrikadriaanbo: open the console and look at the HTML tree
[03:36:27] <hendrikadriaanbo> In firefox i can see it indeed
[03:36:44] <hendrikadriaanbo> Well my problem is little bit complicated actually
[03:37:11] <Kambfhase> levu: that is the fastet + shortest way( using jQuery anyways)
[03:37:53] <hendrikadriaanbo> with YQL i load a external webpage by xpath. Importing meta-title is working ok, but importing a meta-description or keyword is not working. I can see it is loaded from YQL but it will append nothing
[03:41:42] <TC_> yeah the URL is correct, Kambfhase
[03:43:07] <Kambfhase> mkay, well 500 doesnt sound good
[03:44:02] <TC_> I was still waiting on the actual chat to produce something
[03:44:08] <TC_> but it didn't but my CPU has been swallowed :P
[03:44:15] <TC_> so im going to leave and cool it down
[03:44:20] <TC_> I mailed my host anyway
[03:44:23] <TC_> see what they find out
[03:44:39] <TC_> i'll be back later.
[03:44:40] <TC_> chow.
[04:00:47] <hendrikadriaanbo> Can .ajax actually do cross-domain ?
[04:01:57] <nexflo_> with jsonp yes
[04:02:51] <hendrikadriaanbo> and jsonp had to be enabled on the other server right ?
[04:03:12] <hendrikadriaanbo> Lets say i want to load google. is this possible ?
[04:03:18] <Kambfhase> no
[04:03:30] <hendrikadriaanbo> What is the best way of doing this ?
[04:03:33] <Kambfhase> google is no JSON
[04:03:41] <Kambfhase> you can use an iframe though
[04:05:31] <Whirl3d> Nothing like a good power outtage with no ups to get your day started!
[04:06:04] <nexflo_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[04:06:27] <nexflo_> you could always fetch stuff via a backend script on your server...and do the ajax via that
[04:07:21] <Whirl3d> I have a block of text that I am styling with CSS. I can change the size of the font, the color of the font,etc. Which means I am applying styles to that text. However, I can't adjust it's position no matter what---fixed/absolute, 43000 margin text-indent, etc. I have tried everything. What could possibly cause that (besides the fact that CSS sucks?)
[04:18:46] <nexflo_> Whirl: what element is it?
[04:18:58] <nexflo_> is it a block element? if not try setting display:block first....
[04:47:10] <Ismogoan> http://jsfiddle.net/KNwz9/2/
[04:47:17] <Ismogoan> help please xxx
[04:48:09] <mehale> can u point me to a good jquery paginator?
[04:48:51] <Ismogoan> how can I check if an element is empty or not?
[04:49:00] <Ismogoan> eg <span></span>
[05:00:24] <SuperRoach> Ismogoan, you there?
[05:00:29] <dabear> Ismogoan: check if .contents().length is 0
[05:00:35] <SuperRoach> Just use isEmptyOject
[05:00:38] <SuperRoach> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[05:01:21] <SuperRoach> Actually I think mine is for properties only - dabear would be better
[05:01:23] <dabear> That doesn't work for dom elements
[05:12:46] <Krinkle> SuperRoach: EmptObject is for things like var a = {}; (empty object)
[05:13:23] <Krinkle> An DOM Element (afaik)  always has object properties, otherwise it's not a dom element (or do you mean attributes ?)
[05:16:33] <SuperRoach> isEmptyobject would be true for a <p> tag (without classes etc)
[05:16:39] <SuperRoach> but would be false for a valid <img>
[05:18:34] <dabear> ?source isemptyobject:
[05:18:35] <bot-t> Line#523 - "isEmptyObject: function( obj ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#523
[05:21:19] <dabear> $.isEmptyObject(new Image())
[05:21:22] <dabear> false
[05:21:29] <dabear> ?eval $.isEmptyObject(new Image())
[05:21:30] <bot-t> dabear: ReferenceError: Image is not defined
[05:22:37] <dabear> SuperRoach: same goes for $.isEmptyObject(document.createElement("p")) // false
[05:38:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> any reason the click event isn't triggered on disabled inputs?
[05:46:37] <Krinkle> proLoser: Because browsers don't allow you to. Not related to jQuery.
[05:46:54] <Krinkle> use readonly="" attribute if you need it to be accessable but not editable
[05:59:28] <dr0id> hi

[07:22:39] <Kambfhase> i mean 500 is a server error. that would have nothin to do with jquery
[07:23:14] <TC_> the php only contains a for loop
[07:23:14] <TC_> xD
[07:23:25] <khurram> is there any insert function in jquery like append what i want is to make a rectangle at the place of the click and then make it rectangle big or small till he releases the click. please guide how should i be doin this
[07:23:42] <TC_> bu t it doesn't happen all the time.. just... rarely. >.<
[07:25:38] <Kambfhase> maybe you parse the get parameters wrongly
[07:28:07] <TC_> i highly doubt it.
[07:30:39] <khurram> how can i show the pageX and pageY just next to the cursor ?
[07:33:50] <TC_> it just happened on the chat, only no internal server error or anything given from the .ajax
[07:33:51] <TC_> >.<
[07:34:22] <mi> hi
[07:34:26] <mi> please help me
[07:34:32] <mi> I used ajax
[07:34:39] <mi> jquery ajax
[07:34:55] <Guest94835> but cant send complete data!
[07:34:57] <Guest94835> :(
[07:35:00] <albacker> how do i know if a div is empty? I'm using prepend to 'fill it up' but i'm not sure during my script if there's data inside or no (ajax calls). So i'd like  to have something like : "no data to display" if its empty. thanks
[07:35:44] <Guest94835> I have a richtext ,
[07:35:58] <Guest94835> but jquery can't send complete data!
[07:36:06] <Guest94835> plz help me
[07:36:13] <bot-t> albacker, is(":empty")
[07:36:33] <bot-t> albacker, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[07:36:46] <bot-t> albacker, :empty: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes). http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[07:37:06] <albacker> $('#foo').is(':empty').prepend("No data"); this would be correct?
[07:45:49] <_bacon> I am trying to create an async script loading function for and test it in qunit. I notice that the test fails the first time it loads but after a reload all tests pass. could anyone take a look at this gist? https://gist.github.com/985531 trying to load jquery remotely
[07:54:51] <TC_> ?empty
[07:54:52] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[07:54:55] <TC_> nice.
[07:54:56] <TC_> :P
[07:57:29] <albacker> if i'm adding stuff like <span class='foo'>CLICK ME</span> using the jquery .prepend(); to a div. And in the JS code i have something like $('.foo').click(function(){..}); will the click work even though the span elements might have been added in a later time?
[07:58:22] <_bacon> albacker: I think you'd need the live function in that case
[07:58:43] <_bacon> $('.foo').live('click', function(){});
[07:59:40] <albacker> thanks it works. :)
[08:02:20] <albacker> var f=$(this).parent().('a'').attr('href');  does this mean  "give me the value of the attribute href of a <a> element that is located in the same element (div) as the current one? it seems not to work.
[08:02:28] <albacker> 'a' *
[08:03:27] <_bacon> if that's in your click handler function its just: var f = this.href
[08:03:46] <_bacon> if .foo is always going to be an anchor element
[08:04:27] <iszak> albacker, you want $(this).parent().find('a').attr('href'); although there may be > 1 anchor
[08:04:49] <Kambfhase> $(this).siblings('a').attr('href');
[08:04:52] <albacker> no there's 1 anchor in the div.
[08:04:58] <iszak> Kambfhase, it might be deeper
[08:05:10] <albacker> both of them work in my case :) thanks
[08:05:15] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:05:21] <iszak> whatever, fuck helping people.
[08:05:47] <Kambfhase> :o
[08:05:55] <albacker> why so negative?
[08:09:38] <_bacon> are there any qunit discussion channels?
[08:11:13] <Phiphel^> Hi. I'm using template and the first div (class="item_brick") doesn't get drawn. http://pastebin.com/TcFwpWas Any ideas why not?
[08:26:04] <skylamer> hello is there a program which u can put a some string and can return same string prepend with some options like - - prefixes ?
[08:27:56] <_bacon> +
[08:28:13] <_bacon> return "â€”" + str
[08:31:20] <skylamer> _bacon i mean automated : D )
[08:32:18] <Kambfhase> function addPrefix( prefix){ return function( str){ return prefix+str; }; }
[08:32:56] <Kambfhase> addPrefix("hello")("world") // helloworld
[08:33:15] <_bacon> mmm curry
[08:33:44] <mipo> please help me
[08:34:00] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ mipo
[08:34:01] <bot-t> mipo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:34:47] <sean`> curry and _bacon
[08:34:48] <sean`> that's hot
[08:35:09] <mipo> when I send a data via jquery ajax
[08:35:20] <mipo> I hve problem
[08:36:36] <mipo> my data is break
[08:36:53] <mipo> how to send long data with jquery
[08:36:53] <Kambfhase> that is no a question
[08:36:55] <mipo> ajaz
[08:36:58] <mipo> ajax
[08:37:10] <Kambfhase> ?p @ mipo
[08:37:12] <bot-t> mipo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:37:27] <mipo> ok
[08:37:28] <mipo> wit
[08:37:31] <mipo> wait
[08:40:20] <mipo> Kambfhase, http://jsfiddle.net/pj2eg/
[08:41:40] <Kambfhase> and what was you problem again?
[08:41:55] <mipo> I used Ckeditor
[08:42:03] <mipo> for html content!
[08:42:14] <mipo> when I send that data with jquery
[08:42:55] <mipo> Just I can get content before a space or empty part!
[08:44:02] <Kambfhase> are you sure that editor.getData() gives you the full data?
[08:44:09] <mipo> yes~
[08:44:38] <mipo> with  alert
[08:46:03] <Kambfhase> maybe you need to encode it
[08:46:17] <mipo> with jquery?
[08:47:35] <_bacon> not sure if this is a jquery question or not. but my problem is in loading a script file and using a callback when its loaded. this works after it loads but not the first time after clearing cache:
[08:47:35] <_bacon> http://jsfiddle.net/xn6BP/
[08:47:51] <Kambfhase> mipo: yeah, you can try $.param()
[08:48:06] <mipo> Kambfhase, Wait for tesing!
[08:48:56] <Kambfhase> _bacon: why not use one of the over 9000 script loaders out there?
[08:49:39] <_bacon> Kambfhase: I'd be open to it. Which do you suggest
[08:50:14] <_bacon> was thinking of trying script.js
[08:50:21] <Kambfhase> http://microjs.com/#loader
[08:50:26] <Kambfhase> pick one
[08:55:51] <Drager> Hi there, I have a question. I have done a toggle funcion on a div. Simple as it sounds. Show/Hide. Now i want to save the statement if you're going to a diffrent page
[08:58:06] <tbranyen> Drager: use localStorage
[08:58:19] <mipo> Kambfhase, can't work!
[08:58:35] <Drager> I'm a beginner at jQuery so that does'nt tell me very much tbranyen
[08:58:50] <tbranyen> Drager: it tells you to stop being lazy and google it
[08:59:00] <tbranyen> not gonna spoon feed you today sorry
[08:59:05] <Drager> Haha, alright
[08:59:06] <mipo> param code is true, but can't send completly
[08:59:36] <tbranyen> Drager: there are quite a few libraries that provide that functionality, jStorage is one of them
[08:59:49] <Drager> Thx
[09:05:29] <Kambfhase> mipo: hmm, not sure. there is a limit for post, but i doubt you hit it. how do you use .param() ?
[09:07:50] <mipo> Kambfhase, var page_content = editor.getData();page_content = $.param(page_content);
[09:09:48] <Kambfhase> try this:  page_content = $.param({pagecontent: pagecontent})
[09:12:34] <TC_> Is there a sample for jQuery.ajax with json?
[09:14:21] <tbranyen> TC_: jQuery.getJSON("somejson.json", function( JASON ) { });
[09:14:50] <TC_> I mean in the .ajax function.
[09:15:06] <TC_> dataType: "json"
[09:16:20] <tbranyen> TC_: do you need the ajax function over getJSON for some reason?
[09:16:30] <tbranyen> since getJSON uses ajax under the hood
[09:16:48] <TC_> uh
[09:16:53] <TC_> well I'm only familiar with .ajax
[09:17:02] <Whirl3d> is jqueryUI worth loading for just the draggable behavior?
[09:17:15] <tbranyen> well getJSON wraps around the ajax method specifically for getting JSON data faster
[09:17:20] <tbranyen> seems like an obvious choice
[09:17:44] <tbranyen> and by faster i mean writing out code faster, it doesn't fetch data and parse it any faster
[09:17:56] <TC_> Okay, uhm.
[09:18:33] <Kambfhase> Whirl3d: if you just need draggable make a custom build
[09:19:30] <Pet^Aw> hello
[09:20:05] <Pet^Aw> someone can help me with a jquery path problem ?
[09:21:04] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ Pet^Aw
[09:21:05] <bot-t> Pet^Aw, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:25:10] <Whirl3d> And if you are totally intimidated and freaked out because this is the first time you have been yelled at by a bot for trying to be polite. TOUGH
[09:25:53] <Whirl3d> Kambfhase, I've never tried my own draggable. Is it hard to do?
[09:26:19] <jethrot> I'm in a function and I need to use AJAX to retreive data but $.ajax() requires a callback and I cannot use one in this case.  Is there a way to do a blocking AJAX call using $.ajax?
[09:26:28] <snover> jethrot: yes you can.
[09:26:39] <snover> jethrot: by which I mean, yes you can use a callback.
[09:26:47] <jethrot> I cannot use one
[09:26:51] <snover> yes. you can.
[09:26:54] <jethrot> I am asking is there another way
[09:26:58] <snover> no.
[09:27:05] <jethrot> There must be another way.
[09:27:09] <snover> fix your code.
[09:27:15] <jethrot> I cannot its DataTables
[09:27:25] <snover> that statement does not make any sense.
[09:27:27] <jethrot> DataTables Details function is not going to allow me to that
[09:27:34] <jethrot> www.datatables.net
[09:28:07] <Kambfhase> Whirl3d: no, i mean that you can create you own jquery ui versino with just the core+draggable modules at http://jqueryui.com/download
[09:28:14] <Drager> :(
[09:28:36] <snover> jethrot: what are you talking about?
[09:28:37] <jethrot> snover: http://datatables.net/examples/server_side/row_details.html
[09:28:47] <jethrot> see "fnFormatDetails"
[09:28:52] <Whirl3d> Kambfhase, sounds good. I'll check it out. As always, thanks for the advice.
[09:29:14] <snover> jethrot: see what about it?
[09:29:33] <jethrot> It must return a string containing the content, but in my case I must retreive the content using AJAX
[09:30:50] <snover> $.ajax({ url: 'your shit', success: function (data) { oTable.fnOpen(nTr, data, 'details'); } })
[09:30:58] <snover> or whatever
[09:30:59] <snover> what a shitty api
[09:31:25] <jethrot> it was "written about in the NYTimes"
[09:31:42] <Phiphel> Hi. I'm using tmpl, but the first DIV (class='item_brick' ) doesn't get drawn. Any idea why it skips it? http://pastebin.com/TcFwpWas
[09:32:10] <snover> oh, I forgot, newspapers are the authority of good software design
[09:32:14] <snover> how silly of me
[09:32:15] <Pet^Aw> i use the jquery filetree plugin and it want the real path of my filesystem for the root directory "C:/www/prova" , i need to set the web path for the root directory of my webapp like: "/prova/subfolder/"
[09:34:27] <imsky> good afternoon jquery, if you're in my timezone
[09:35:04] <Bitbuzz> greetings all
[09:35:18] <imsky> sup Bitbuzz
[09:36:53] <Bitbuzz> not much...thinking about an application layer / sandbox i want to design for future projects
[09:37:15] <imsky> nice
[09:37:51] <Bitbuzz> saw a great vid on yahoo developer theater
[09:37:58] <Bitbuzz> about that
[09:38:04] <TC_> Ok I got more info
[09:38:08] <TC_> http://vvcap.net/db/_SXJUhXuZYTktC1d1uCH.htp look at this...
[09:38:12] <TC_> no 500 internal
[09:38:16] <TC_> the setTimeout/ajax just... stops
[09:41:32] <Kambfhase> Bitbuzz: is you want to create big scalable applications you might think abaout using a different tool than jQuery
[09:42:30] <Bitbuzz> kamb:like what? extjs?
[09:42:41] <Kambfhase> YUI
[09:43:10] <Kambfhase> dojo
[09:43:24] <jethrot> snover how do you pass a variable to success: function (data)
[09:43:57] <Bitbuzz> kamb: is there a lightweight one? with moderate learn curve?
[09:44:28] <imsky> "big scalable apps" "lightweight library"
[09:44:30] <imsky> hmmmmmmm
[09:45:07] <Kambfhase> that
[09:45:16] <Bitbuzz> never said big scalable apps... :)
[09:45:30] <Bitbuzz> just apps...
[09:46:02] <Bitbuzz> a way to load modules as needed, keep private data, etc...
[09:46:03] <imsky> jquery's fine even for big apps
[09:46:15] <imsky> but it's not a very wieldy tool for proper development
[09:46:22] <imsky> that is, there's no inherent discipline
[09:46:41] <Bitbuzz> imsky: that makes sense
[09:47:35] <imsky> here's a great post i read about just this topic: http://addyosmani.com/blog/large-scale-jquery/
[09:47:58] <imsky> applicable to the kind of projects i work on, which are big, heavy, client-side apps
[09:48:53] <Bitbuzz> great link. thx
[09:49:24] <jethrot> is there a "dom index number" of a dom node?
[09:49:57] <Drager> How can i use toggle in a loop?
[09:49:58] <Drager> :E
[09:50:06] <imsky> Drager: use it in a loop, duh
[09:50:09] <Drager> :D
[09:50:21] <Drager> Im trying to do that
[09:50:27] <jethrot> is there a "dom index number" of a dom node?  something I can use?
[09:50:28] <Pet^Aw> i use the jquery filetree plugin and it want the real path of my filesystem for the root directory "C:/www/prova" , i need to set the web path for the root directory of my webapp like: "/prova/subfolder/"  , sameone have the solution ??
[09:50:36] <imsky> jethrot: lolwat
[09:50:36] <jethrot> snover you still there
[09:50:42] <jethrot> imsky I have this problem..
[09:51:14] <jethrot> imsky function A() { var bb=this.parentNode;  $.ajax( ... success: function(data){ ... I need to use 'bb' here...
[09:51:38] <Drager> imsky: I'm pretty sure it's looping the "box" i wanna show and not the toggle function :p
[09:51:52] <imsky> Drager: paste your code
[09:51:57] <Drager> Alrighy
[09:52:06] <imsky> jethrot: you can use bb there
[09:52:17] <jethrot> but bb is local to function A() not to the $.ajax call
[09:52:53] <imsky> it'd still work
[09:53:05] <jethrot> even if the value of bb changes?
[09:53:12] <imsky> uhh
[09:53:14] <imsky> sure >_>
[09:53:17] <ravenzz> :d
[09:53:48] <Drager> imsky: Here you go https://pastee.org/8n3m5
[09:53:58] <zfmf> i have something like that: <tr><td></td><td>test</td></tr> on click on test i want to hide the hole table row, i do $(this).parent('tr').hide() but it dont work , which function i have to use?
[09:53:59] <imsky> you popsmith
[09:54:04] <imsky> we use jsfiddle
[09:54:29] <ravenzz> closest('tr')
[09:54:49] <imsky> Drager: so it doesn't do...what exactly
[09:55:16] <zfmf> closest also dont work tryed it before
[09:55:27] <Drager> Well ye, it does'nt hide "all" boxes
[09:55:50] <ravenzz> then paste your code
[09:55:57] <ravenzz> on jsfiddle.net
[09:56:09] <imsky> Drager: you have multiple boxes with id "box"?
[09:56:21] <ravenzz> yeha
[09:56:26] <ravenzz> while
[09:56:27] <Drager> hmm, The loop creates boxes after the result..
[09:56:33] <Drager> but
[09:56:35] <imsky> have you heard of classes?
[09:56:38] <ravenzz> Drager you should use classes
[09:56:41] <Drager> Ops
[09:56:42] <Drager> :D
[09:56:49] <ravenzz> IDs are unique
[09:56:55] <ravenzz> or should be unique
[09:57:05] <Drager> haha omg
[09:57:09] <Drager> Im such a dumbass
[09:57:09] <Drager> :D
[09:57:23] <Drager> ravenzz: Ye i know
[09:57:41] <Drager> Only one same id on one page
[09:57:52] <Drager> well, thx imsky :)
[09:57:56] <imsky> yw Drager
[09:58:22] <ravenzz> $('lol').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('.box').toggle() });
[09:58:40] <imsky> $('trololol') you mean
[09:58:41] <imsky> good sir
[09:58:53] <ravenzz> lol
[09:59:13] <ravenzz> i miss a dot
[10:00:25] <imsky> if you don't use the foxscape theme for firefox
[10:00:30] <imsky> you are the worst type of communist
[10:00:48] <ravenzz> i dislike firefox
[10:00:52] <ravenzz> it's slow
[10:00:56] <imsky> not ff4
[10:01:04] <ravenzz> ff *
[10:01:13] <imsky> sir you are wrong as blazes
[10:01:22] <imsky> also firefox is indispensable to development
[10:01:29] <ravenzz> maybe i have the worst core 2 duo
[10:01:37] <imsky> could be
[10:01:42] <imsky> i got freaking ssh in my firefox
[10:01:51] <imsky> could get irc and ftp if i wanted
[10:01:54] <ravenzz> but it has been/is slow
[10:01:55] <ravenzz> here
[10:01:58] <imsky> firefox is the emacs of browsers
[10:02:01] <ravenzz> i prefer chrome
[10:02:06] <imsky> ravenzz: you're probably running 3.6
[10:02:30] <ravenzz> Chrome is faster of any firefox version
[10:02:43] <imsky> hmm no
[10:02:45] <imsky> no it's not
[10:02:46] <ravenzz> also i prefere his developer tools
[10:03:01] <imsky> i know because i have chrome side by side with ff4 and i switched from chrome once the speed difference has disappeared
[10:03:03] <ravenzz> -e
[10:03:39] <ravenzz> dunno i feel good with chrome
[10:04:08] <jedimind> ravenzz, i love chrome too and have been using it almost exclusively for the last year or so
[10:04:12] <ravenzz> the popups blocker is better than the ff one
[10:04:21] <jedimind> but 5 days ago i got an SSD, and now im kinda liking FF again
[10:04:26] <jedimind> now that i dont hav eto wait 18 minutes for it to load
[10:04:28] <imsky> o_O
[10:04:34] <imsky> firefox loads in less than a second for me
[10:04:40] <imsky> what kind of ancient pcs do you people use
[10:04:45] <jedimind> imsky, when its cached, yeah, not initial load
[10:05:09] <imsky> that matters because...
[10:05:28] <jedimind> because i run enough apps that it's not always cached
[10:05:35] <imsky> are you on windows?
[10:05:38] <jedimind> yeah
[10:05:46] <imsky> it's guaranteed both browsers are cached for you
[10:05:50] <imsky> it's called prefetch
[10:05:58] <imsky> you haven't had a cold start in a looooong time
[10:06:10] <jedimind> i cold start every morning
[10:06:10] <ravenzz> i haven't any extensions on ff and it sucks compared to chrome ... about fasteness
[10:06:30] <jedimind> and prefetch only fetches most used apps, which in my case arent always browsers
[10:06:31] <Kambfhase> jedimind: instant human, just add coffee
[10:06:40] <jedimind> anyway, none if it is an issue now that i have the ssd anyway
[10:06:45] <imsky> true dat
[10:06:51] <imsky> though i read ssd's die pretty commonly
[10:06:57] <imsky> keeping me from switching to them
[10:07:04] <jedimind> imsky, only for people who dont optimize them
[10:07:13] <imsky> how do you optimize ssd's
[10:07:16] <jedimind> for example leaving on windows indexing on an ssd will kill it
[10:07:25] <jedimind> (sooner than having it off that is)
[10:07:28] <imsky> wow that's fragile
[10:07:33] <imsky> thanks for the tip dude lol
[10:07:37] <imsky> i'll just get some raptors instead
[10:07:55] <Strangebrew> i have many spans in a page all under the same div, one of them is <span>john</span> and the other <span>jane</span>. how can i choose them both?
[10:07:58] <jedimind> i had a raptor before this ssd, the ssd is so much faster
[10:08:03] <jedimind> its ridiculous
[10:08:04] <imsky> is it faster than a ramdisk?
[10:08:20] <jedimind> well, no i wont imagine so, but i havent tried it myself
[10:08:30] <imsky> try firefox on a ramdisk
[10:08:35] <imsky> it'll be as fast as your ssd :D
[10:08:38] <jedimind> haha
[10:08:50] <jedimind> im more impressed with like the 2 second photoshop startup on coldboot
[10:08:57] <Kambfhase> Strangebrew: $(youDiv).children('span:contains("john"), span:contains("jane")')
[10:08:58] <imsky> yeap, or put photoshop in ramdisk
[10:09:00] <imsky> doesn't really matter
[10:09:26] <Strangebrew> thank you Kambfhase !:)
[10:09:35] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:10:04] <TC_> Kambfhase: http://vvcap.net/db/RFeB4g4Vyt30jyuJTHH8.htp I get 500's
[10:10:05] <TC_> rarely but I do
[10:10:26] <TC_> My mate tried it, and ... well the loop or whatever just stopped. No error from the ajax call.
[10:11:36] <Kambfhase> 500 looks like an error to me
[10:12:32] <TC_> yeah, but I mean.. when my mate tested it...
[10:12:33] <TC_> she iddn't get a 500
[10:12:39] <TC_> she got nothing, it just stopped.
[10:12:50] <Kambfhase> there is nothing a can do about it from here. 500 is a server error. check your php
[10:12:54] <bob___> hi, can anyone help me where I am going wrong with this code  url :$(this).attr("href"),
[10:13:08] <TC_> it actually happens.. with no php in the file too
[10:13:35] <TC_> but it doesn't happen a lot
[10:13:35] <Kambfhase> bob___: looks ok, maybe. what error do you get? paste the code to jsfiddle.net
[10:13:45] <ravenzz> try to request the page from your browser
[10:13:47] <Kambfhase> dos?
[10:14:14] <bob___> it works if i do url: "#?id=1";
[10:14:47] <Kambfhase> bob___: that is `this`in your cas?
[10:15:31] <ravenzz> is $(this) defined?
[10:16:58] <bob___> this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/7kgJK/
[10:17:50] <ravenzz> #?id=3 is not an url
[10:19:04] <dtach> trying to animate a curtain (like a theater) and was wondering how i could make the animation a bit more random and as if someone is pulling the cord to pull the curtain in, so variable speed and how far it animates the position
[10:19:18] <bob___> thanks
[10:19:50] <Kambfhase> Math.random()
[10:20:01] <bob___> @ravenzz it works after i took # off - thanks
[10:24:37] <thathurts> can i use the print() function to print out only a string--not a window?
[10:26:50] <Whirl3d> How do I enable scrollable content after applying the UI.draggable behavior to a div?
[10:33:20] <TC_> Kambfhase, the internal server error is a premature one. It's getting killed before it can output headers.
[10:33:46] <Kambfhase> o.O
[10:34:19] <TC_> I have a process limit of 25, but I highly doubt ever my code is generating that many process usages in just 1 single person.
[10:34:25] <TC_> it would be using maybe 5 maximum
[10:34:36] <TC_> 3 from the chat, 1 from ftp, 1 from cpanel or somethin
[10:38:12] <Drager> Is it possible to just trig one of my toggles when i press the button?
[10:38:29] <skylamer> click(*(() ?
[10:38:30] <Drager> Now if i press one button it toggles both
[10:40:35] <Drager> skylamer: How do you mean?
[11:07:05] <abjorn> http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/
[11:07:28] <bittyx-laptop> hey, i'm calling something like elem.fadeOut(function(){ this.remove(); }); and the element fades out, but doesn't actually get removed from the DOM (i can still see it with style="display:none" in firebug)... what's up with that?
[11:09:37] <skamikaze> ?remove @ bittyx-laptop
[11:09:37] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[11:09:58] <skamikaze> ah ok, sry, should start reading
[11:10:12] <skamikaze> first argument for fadeOut is the delay, 2nd your callback
[11:11:03] <bittyx-laptop> ah, so i have to supply a duration if i want to have a callback... okay, thanks
[11:11:24] <bittyx-laptop> (i got the impression it wasn't necessary, from other pieces of code in the jquery docs)
[11:12:34] <skamikaze> bittyx-laptop: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.5&fn=fadeOut
[11:12:47] <skamikaze> easing is optional
[11:13:09] <skamikaze> (if you want a callback)
[11:27:41] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[11:28:43] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Morning
[11:28:49] <ravenzz> hello wkmanire
[11:28:58] <wkmanire> Jeese, are you guys still at it?
[11:29:17] <DanAKAHollywood> I went and took a slight coma before coming back to it.
[11:29:26] <wkmanire> ah ok
[11:29:48] <Drager> Is it possible to just trig one of my toggles when i press the button?
[11:29:50] <Drager> Now if i press one button it toggles both
[11:30:23] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: A little more specific please.
[11:30:29] <Drager> Okay
[11:32:01] <Drager> One button trigger one toggle and another button trigger another toggle. If i click at one button both toggle trigger.
[11:32:35] <wkmanire> Drager: It sounds like you need more specific selectors.
[11:33:22] <Drager> Ye, okay.
[11:33:37] <Drager> $('a.lol').click(function(){
[11:33:37] <Drager> 	$('.box').toggle(100);
[11:33:37] <Drager> });
[11:33:46] <Drager> and to call it
[11:33:51] <Drager> <a class
[11:33:53] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: Do both have class .box?
[11:34:36] <Drager> Ye and I know that's the problem
[11:34:51] <ravenzz> which one you would toggle?
[11:34:53] <ravenzz> the 1st?
[11:35:00] <Drager> Yes
[11:35:20] <wkmanire> Use .one() or :first
[11:35:23] <ravenzz> then select the ferst $('a.lol:first')
[11:35:27] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: $('.box:first').toggle(100);
[11:35:28] <ravenzz> ferst lol
[11:35:43] <wkmanire> Phonetically reasonable.
[11:36:08] <Drager> Ye okay
[11:36:19] <Drager> Now i want to trigger the second box
[11:36:34] <DanAKAHollywood> $('.box:second').toggle(100);
[11:36:52] <ravenzz> lol
[11:37:17] <Drager> Ye, i figured
[11:37:19] <ravenzz> hope he won't trigger the 100th
[11:37:19] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: Personally, I'm not a fan of using selectors like this as it can get complicated, I would just give each a unique id and then select that.
[11:37:47] <Drager> hmm okay
[11:37:55] <ravenzz> or you can do something like
[11:37:56] <ravenzz> this
[11:37:58] <dukebag> hey, i'm looking for a picture zoom type "photo slider"
[11:38:12] <dukebag> i found this, before i go tweakzville on it, i wanted to check if anyone knew an existing solution: http://lab.gianiaz.com/jquery/gzoom/
[11:38:28] <Drager> ravenzz: Like what?
[11:38:32] <dukebag> so it should zoom at a focal point on the photo, then transition to the next photo
[11:40:20] <Drager> $this?
[11:40:21] <Drager> :D
[11:40:26] <ravenzz> $('a.lol').each(function(key, value) { switch(key) { case 0: /* the first */; break; case 1: /* the second */; break } });
[11:40:31] <ravenzz> ?
[11:41:54] <ravenzz> maybe this is too archaic
[11:43:13] <Drager> Ok
[11:43:25] <Drager> I don't rly know how to inplant this but
[11:43:30] <Drager> I'll figure it out mby
[11:43:34] <Drager> thx
[11:44:10] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: I would just stick with the selectors if you only have a couple of buttons to toggle, or give them unique ids if you have several.
[11:44:33] <Drager> DanAKAHollywood: Okay
[11:44:33] <DanAKAHollywood> ravenzz: Don't be breaking his brain with switch/case!
[11:44:46] <bastetmilo> Hi, I have one tiny problem. So I have that simple code http://pastebin.com/W68KpKme - it's works perfect - untli I have more elements like ".gallery_wrap2" (then it count all li in all ul). So is there a way to resolve this? (sorry for my english)
[11:44:50] <ravenzz> maybe you should use index()
[11:45:04] <Drager> DanAKAHollywood: Switch case is fine in php :D
[11:45:06] <ravenzz> dunno i should try
[11:45:23] <DanAKAHollywood> Drager: Switch case is fine in every language.
[11:45:38] <Drager> ye
[11:46:11] <t432> whats jquery's equivalent Ajax function to prototypes Ajax.request Function?
[11:46:27] <wkmanire> bastetmilo: You want to set the width of the UL to the number of LI elements you have times 165?
[11:47:13] <wkmanire> t432: What does Ajax.request do in prototype? A GET?
[11:47:37] <bastetmilo> wkmanire: yes :)
[11:48:10] <ravenzz> The complementary operation to .get(), which accepts an index and returns a DOM node, .index() can take a DOM node and returns an index.
[11:48:23] <ravenzz> "The complementary operation to .get()" ? isn't get used to perform GET requests?
[11:48:42] <t432> wkmanire: "JAX requester: it handles the life-cycle of the request, handles the boilerplate, and lets you plug in callback functions for your custom needs."
[11:48:44] <wkmanire> bastetmilo: Then your code is correct unless you have multiple UL elements in the DOM.
[11:48:47] <t432> AJAX*
[11:49:18] <wkmanire> t432: You can choose from $.ajax(), $.get(), and $.post() depending on how much control you need.
[11:49:33] <t432> interesting thanks
[11:49:49] <DanAKAHollywood> t432: You probably want $.get().
[11:49:49] <t432> which gives you the most?
[11:49:50] <wkmanire> $.get('coolstuff.json', function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) { console.log(data); });
[11:50:02] <wkmanire> $.ajax is the lowest level and gives you tons of options
[11:50:12] <t432> ok thx
[11:50:21] <bastetmilo> wkmanire: yes, I know that. And I need a way to do that for many ul elements.
[11:52:05] <bastetmilo> wkmanire: first what I think is "foreach" - but it seems that js don't have that.
[11:52:11] <wkmanire> bastetmilo: hmmm,  $('.gallery_wrap2 ul').each(function () { var $this = $(this); $this.css('width', $this.find('li').length * 165) });
[11:52:29] <wkmanire> something like that might work
[11:52:36] <ravenzz> bastetmilo each() is the same
[11:55:45] <wkmanire> wow, coffee script sure does look nice
[11:56:14] <bastetmilo> OK. Thanks very much for help guys :)
[11:56:33] <wkmanire> I'm gonna have to break down and learn it eventually. Looks like it isn't gonna go away any time soon.
[11:56:38] <wkmanire> bastetmilo: np
[12:01:04] <TC_> Would this work: http://pastebin.com/sDYCa13q
[12:01:04] <TC_> ?
[12:01:07] <TC_> So that...
[12:01:12] <TC_> if both succeed, it'll do the timeout
[12:01:19] <bastetmilo> wkmanire: your code works just perfect :) thanks again
[12:01:30] <wkmanire> ;)
[12:02:17] <tmayr> probably wouldnt, as itll compare before any of the ajax requests are done
[12:02:31] <madprops> if I want to delete a record would using $.get be alright?
[12:02:44] <madprops> or what should I use?'
[12:03:17] <TC_> So what should I do to produce what I want, tmayr?
[12:03:33] <tmayr> you could use a while, but im not sure how efficient that would be
[12:03:50] <TC_> I could "nest" the ajax calls...
[12:04:02] <tmayr> would probably cock up if they're not finished, yeah you could do that too
[12:04:21] <TC_> but is nesting them a good idea
[12:04:22] <TC_> ?
[12:05:04] <tmayr> i dont think its a bad idea, might be a better way to do it tho, im not sure
[12:05:30] <gnarf> TC_: what version of jQuery?
[12:05:54] <TC_> 1.6
[12:06:13] <gnarf> you can save both ajax requests to vars, and $.when them
[12:06:26] <tmayr> oh right, forgot about that
[12:06:34] <TC_> uhm
[12:06:39] <TC_> can one of you provide a sample?
[12:06:44] <TC_> I can put the ajax requests to vars...
[12:06:47] <TC_> but not sure about the when
[12:07:24] <TC_> $.when($.ajax("/page1.php"), $.ajax("/page2.php"))   .then(myFunc, myFailure);
[12:07:25] <TC_> something like that?
[12:09:51] <gnarf> TC_: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/BSLeQ/
[12:10:39] <TC_> thanks i'll try that
[12:11:24] <mykul> so nifty
[12:12:07] <TC_> where do the result1, result2 come from
[12:13:08] <mykul> passed as arguments to the callback in done
[12:13:42] <TC_> Okay. So is this what I'm looking for: http://pastebin.com/z7hmN7ny ?
[12:18:07] <Wulf> Hello
[12:18:30] <Samot> $(".someclass").trigger("mousedown") works in firefox and chrome, not in internet explorer "Object required"
[12:18:49] <Wulf> If I make an AJAX request and finally get the answer, a function is called. Will this function run in another thread, so I might get race conditions?
[12:19:25] <sv_in> @Samot, check it again using jQuery instead of $
[12:19:36] <Samot> ok thanks
[12:20:58] <thomasd> Hello
[12:21:14] <Samot> sv_in still testing it but would you mind me asking why that would be a cross browser problem
[12:22:47] <Samot> using jQuery didn't work
[12:23:00] <sv_in> thinking... thinking..
[12:23:05] <thomasd> can i see the code your working on
[12:23:12] <Samot> I have been on this for about 3 hours r0fl
[12:23:36] <thomasd> is there a pastbin or something
[12:23:45] <Samot> ummm
[12:23:50] <Samot> $(".someclass").trigger("mousedown") works in firefox and chrome, not in internet explorer "Object required"
[12:24:23] <Samot> the attached mousedown in question is actually a thirdparty obfuscated code
[12:24:34] <thomasd> cant you just run $(".someclas").mousedown();?
[12:24:34] <TC_> I need some assistance with json.
[12:24:42] <thomasd> TC_ shoot
[12:24:46] <TC_> success: function(data) { ... }
[12:24:46] <solars> hey, is it possible to scroll a select element to the selected value somehow?
[12:24:47] <TC_> for instance
[12:24:50] <TC_> if data comtained {"newMessage":1,"users":["john","jane","baby"]}
[12:25:00] <TC_> how would I access... them
[12:25:10] <TC_> for instance... I'd like to say .. if newMessage == 1 ... do this
[12:25:37] <TC_> I also want to do.. users.each(function() { ... do this });
[12:25:40] <TC_> or something
[12:26:43] <solars> is there something like scrollintoview?
[12:26:47] <thomasd> solars element.value
[12:27:00] <gnarf> ?scrollTo
[12:27:01] <bot-t> gnarf, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[12:27:39] <k_89> TC_ , write the whole thing in one reply... also data.newMessage will give u access to newMessage value
[12:28:05] <TC_> Actually, let me write up a fiddle.
[12:28:34] <solars> thomasd, how does that work?
[12:29:01] <solars> thomasd, what I want to do is scroll a select box to the selected option
[12:29:04] <thomasd> in an option element when you select a value it goes to that selection. I thought thats what your where talking about.
[12:30:12] <solars> it is already selected, you mean I use the previous selection to select the same so it scrolls there?
[12:31:22] <TC_> Here, this should be good enough : http://jsfiddle.net/WTP3N/2/
[12:33:35] <solars> gnarf, is this suggested for select boxes to show the currently selected option?
[12:34:44] <k_89> TC_ , i don't know why isn't it working, try replacing .each thing with this http://pastebin.com/1x4fk4zL
[12:36:47] <TC_> Nupe. http://jsfiddle.net/WTP3N/6/ doesn#t even work without that ibt
[12:37:17] <TC_> oh
[12:37:20] <TC_> it's set as mootools.
[12:37:46] <k_89> TC_ i don't know how to use jsfiddle
[12:37:46] <TC_> yeah that works
[12:37:48] <TC_> great!
[12:38:37] <Whirl3d> Using jQuery UI, how do I enable the draggable behaviour on scrollable content without disabling the scrollbars?
[12:40:57] <gnarf> solars: im not sure wtf you're talking about
[12:41:00] <gnarf> solars: see ?p
[12:41:01] <bot-t> solars, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:41:30] <gnarf> solars: if you are talking about <select> elements, they only display their selected value, and if you open it the ones near it
[12:43:11] <solars> gnarf, sorry: I have a select box with 20 elements, showing 10, and 15 is selected. so its not visible. now I need scroll the list to this element so the selection is visible
[12:43:22] <solars> I've thought $('#service-category').val($('#service-category').val()); might work, but doesn't
[12:43:42] <solars> *I thought
[12:43:45] <Whirl3d> gnaf, I'm using the scrollTo plugin you mentioned and easing was working fine for a while, but suddenly just quit. Is there anything in particular I should be looking for?
[12:46:47] <nickiname> Hi guys, is anyone of you familiar with the nivo-slider?
[12:46:59] <illmatix> How can I detect another element in canvas?
[12:47:03] <nickiname> Im very frustrating, i cant get it to work after one week
[12:47:09] <illmatix> using jquery svg and canvas
[12:47:36] <nickiname> Hi guys, is anyone of you familiar with the nivo-slider?
[12:47:54] <nickiname> i will be happy to get an aswear
[12:48:32] <abjorn> a bit
[12:48:59] <k_89> nickiname, have any idea how to build one like that??
[12:49:20] <nickiname> k_89: no idea
[12:50:38] <gnarf> solars: is it a select multiple?
[12:50:39] <nickiname> i will destroy my shitty windows laptop tomorrow and i will never fakking ever buy economy shit
[12:51:39] <wkmanire> nickiname: You don't need to destroy it. Just install linux on it.
[12:52:17] <nickiname> wkmanire: maybe, but the fakking windows crashes every hour
[12:52:30] <wkmanire> nickiname: Yes, the fakking windows crashes every hour.
[12:52:31] <bittyx-laptop> hi! is there any place in the docs where i can find the available options for, say, .effect() ? i'm using jqueryui, and the page for .effect only lists options as an object/hash including specific options for the effect - but i've been unable to find a list of those
[12:52:57] <wkmanire> bittyx-laptop: There is an effects sample area in the docs. I'll get the link for you.
[12:53:27] <wkmanire> its just jqueryui.com/demos
[12:53:39] <wkmanire> On the left side there is a list of Effects links, you can review each one individually.
[12:53:57] <nickiname> OHOH
[12:54:08] <Whirl3d> One last time, for good measure...Anybody know how to enable the draggable behavior on a scrolling div without disabling the scrolling ability? jQuery UI scrollable?
[12:54:30] <wkmanire> Whirl3d: he he, sorry Whirl, I really don't know that one.
[12:54:46] <bittyx-laptop> or, if that isn't available, here's my problem - i'm using .effect('highlight', {color:#fcc}); on an input box element (i want it to flash for a moment when something happens). the problem is, my default css defines the input box with a solid 1px border. however, while the highlight effect is in progress, i get a temporary inset border. how do i stop this?
[12:55:15] <Whirl3d> np, I can skip the draggable behavior I guess. thanx for the reply
[12:55:24] <bittyx-laptop> wkmanire: no, there is not a list of what i need - there is a list of possible effects, but not options for each effect (e.g. {color:'#fcc'} in my example)
[12:55:26] <wkmanire> Whirl3d: Yeah, I wasn't ignoring ya.
[12:56:12] <nickiname> A non jquery related question, how many hours does it takes for you to make a basic/standard website that you can sell?
[12:57:13] <ssh71> can take 10 mins to 1 year
[12:57:53] <wkmanire> bittyx-laptop: I see what you're saying, I don't see a list here eitehr.
[12:57:55] <wkmanire> either*
[12:57:56] <nickiname> in average?
[12:58:04] <nickiname> ssh71: average?
[12:58:32] <ssh71> not possible to answer depends what the customer wants
[12:58:38] <ch3mical1> Hi again
[12:58:41] <bittyx-laptop> with high quality (both in standards, design etc.), i could make a basic website (e.g. something static with company info etc.) in a few hours. on the other hand, i've been working on a custom project for two months now, and i'll be done sometime next week. it's really impossible to answer that question.
[12:58:42] <wkmanire> nickiname: There are business card websites and there are ebays.
[12:59:45] <wkmanire> nickiname: Odds are if you can do it in a few hours then there is a service available for the customer to pay for a canned templated website... so it depends on the customer's knowledge of the market.
[12:59:52] <nickiname> wkmanire: another question then.. do you code everything yourself or do you use any CMS?
[13:00:17] <wkmanire> nickiname: I try to do as little coding as possible. But sometimes there aren't good alternatives.
[13:00:37] <nickiname> wkmanire: you you sell websites?
[13:01:07] <wkmanire> nickiname: Not anymore. I got a full time job as a web dev for a webstore.
[13:01:23] <nickiname> wkmanire: nice cool
[13:02:39] <nickiname> im going to start up my own buissnes so i need some advice :D
[13:03:15] <solars> gnarf, sorry didn't see the msg, no its a normal one, not multiple
[13:03:24] <ssh71> nickiname: i have started around 6 month ago and its great, just work hard and learn
[13:03:43] <nickiname> ssh71: is it hard to get customers?
[13:04:20] <ssh71> nickiname: first customer is always hard, but when you have collected some good references it becomes more easy
[13:04:29] <Tant102> That sounded somewhat dirty...
[13:04:45] <ch3mical> Hopefully all customers are hard ;p
[13:04:49] <Tant102> That too.
[13:04:54] <nickiname> ssh71: can i see your portfoli or your website?
[13:04:59] <ch3mical> Otherwise you won't get very good references
[13:05:02] <wkmanire> Good customers are hard to find... I would advise getting some payment upfront and offering a refund policy.
[13:05:03] <ch3mical> lol
[13:05:38] <ssh71> can show you portfolio
[13:05:41] <nickiname> wkmanire: that sounds good
[13:05:50] * wkmanire did one too many jobs for free.
[13:06:04] <sasori> question: may i ask for a simple jquery script that will, enable/disable a button if the checkbox is clicked/unclicked ?
[13:06:11] * ch3mical too
[13:06:21] <ch3mical> sasori: you may
[13:06:47] <sasori> ch3mical: do you have one ready made among your scripts ?
[13:07:14] <nickiname> I think i will go to a big shopping mall and give away business cards, do you think its a good idea?
[13:07:42] <ch3mical> sasori: $('#checkbox').click(function() { $('#button').prop('disabled',!$('#checkbox').prop('checked')); });
[13:07:49] <ch3mical> For jquery 1.6
[13:08:15] <ch3mical> For older versions, you have to use .attr instead of .prop
[13:08:33] <ch3mical> And it will be less reliable
[13:08:54] <snover> dude, gross
[13:09:11] <snover> when you are performing the same selection more than once you are doing it wrong
[13:09:47] <ch3mical> Hey, stfu, it was just a quick type up ;p
[13:10:02] <wkmanire> snover: awaiting your improved version...
[13:10:15] <sasori> ch3mical: here' my js/html code from line 26-42 http://pastebin.com/P5GhdCtK
[13:10:20] <sasori> it doesn't work
[13:10:35] <ch3mical> Plus, that demonstrates how he could select a different checkbox than the one clicked if he needs to
[13:10:42] <Tant102> I'm trying to post an <input type="file" /> to an iframe, but the browser (both ie && ff) ignores any file information. I've got a demo at http://tant102.mine.nu:81/temp.htm and the login for the post is test/test.
[13:10:45] <chuck24> is there a simple way to disabled all the links in a div? I dont want them to be clicked while a user is entering form data
[13:10:46] <nickiname> hello
[13:10:51] <snover> $('#foo').click(function () { $('#bar').prop('disabled', !this.checked); })
[13:10:52] <nickiname> world
[13:10:54] <Tant102> Anyone know if I need something more to post to an iframe?
[13:11:00] <illmatix> using jquery svg and canvas
[13:11:05] <illmatix> How can I detect another element in canvas?
[13:11:45] <wkmanire> chuck24: Yeah, just handle their click events and preventDefault()
[13:12:26] <chuck24> wkmanire, thanks ill give that a try
[13:12:35] <wkmanire> chuck24: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[13:12:39] <ch3mical> Ugh, I hate iframe hacks.. just use ajax, for crying out loud
[13:12:44] <ch3mical> :P
[13:12:50] <wkmanire> ch3mical: He's doing a file upload.
[13:13:31] <Tant102> ch3mical, sure. How? Can I read the file content and send it using javascript?
[13:13:34] <ch3mical> Can't that be done with AJAX?
[13:13:53] <wkmanire> Sending file data? not that I know of.
[13:14:02] <wkmanire> There are a few plugins out there for jQuery that handle this. Such as uploadify
[13:14:04] <snover> no, it canâ€™t.
[13:14:08] <ch3mical> I know you can't save a file to local file system, but you should be able to read one, right
[13:14:09] <ch3mical> ?
[13:14:12] <snover> no.
[13:14:12] <wkmanire> but uploadify seems t have mixed reviews
[13:14:13] <snover> you canâ€™t.
[13:14:34] <ch3mical> Lame :/
[13:14:53] <snover> the lesson here is, donâ€™t hate things you donâ€™t understand ;)
[13:15:03] <ch3mical> Anyway, you could do it in php
[13:15:14] <Tant102> Executing php clientside?
[13:15:21] <Tant102> We're going wild now. ;)
[13:15:25] <ch3mical> lol
[13:15:36] <ch3mical> It's too early for me
[13:15:43] <Tant102> I could also give them an unsigned ocx, acting as a ie-addon, that they need to install ...
[13:17:49] <wkmanire> Tant102: File uploads are a pain in the ass. Big companies take a carpet bombing approach. They'll have a flash uploader, an iframes uploader a silverlight uploader etc... all ready to go.
[13:18:00] <wkmanire> Tant102: Take gmail file uploads for example
[13:18:35] <ch3mical> Sucks that it can't just be handled by html
[13:18:43] <wkmanire> yes
[13:19:03] <Tant102> My target group consists of ... about 8 persons. In total.
[13:19:04] <ch3mical> Maybe HTML5 will include something like that (there's already local storage, so it's not that big of a stretch)
[13:19:10] <Tant102> I expect only 2 will be using it. ;)
[13:19:23] <wkmanire> Tant102: 2 users?
[13:19:33] <Tant102> Yep.
[13:19:38] <wkmanire> Tant102: And you know them by name?
[13:19:43] <Tant102> Yep.
[13:19:47] <k_89> Tant102, http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/how-to-develop-a-html5-image-uploader/ use this... just take out the image part
[13:19:49] <wkmanire> Tant102: Make them use FTP
[13:20:13] <Tant102> wkmanire, it's a customer management system, this is the final part, the ability to "attach" files to customers.
[13:20:28] <wkmanire> oh...
[13:20:40] <njbair> with the metadata plugin, does anybody know if it's possible to use metadata in a selector?
[13:20:57] <ch3mical> So HTML5 does already have this ability
[13:21:04] <k_89> Tant102, check out the link i have given you, i think it takes care of your problem... ability to send files using js
[13:21:08] <Tant102> k_89, cant use html 5. I can tell my users to use latest versions of their browsers, but ie9 does not have the nice html5 features yet.
[13:21:13] <wkmanire> I'll be back later guys.
[13:21:15] <Whirl3d> hey ch3mical! Sorry about the tantrum yesterday...man was I in need of some sleep. thanks again for your help
[13:21:29] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: lol, no worries.. we have our days
[13:22:05] <k_89> Tant102, unless a browser has some sort of support for js file-api, i don't think anything is better than an iframe uploader
[13:22:20] <Tant102> But just take a look at http://tant102.mine.nu:81/temp.htm which does post to the iframe, but an empty post (according to firebug).
[13:22:29] <Tant102> k_89, I know, and that's what I originally asked about. ;)
[13:22:45] <Tant102> The login to the services accepting the post is test/test.
[13:23:02] <k_89> Tant 102, i'll give you a test code i have written for and iframe uploader, it works though
[13:23:18] <Tant102> bazinga!
[13:23:43] <ch3mical> Request.Body.Length = 44
[13:23:51] <Tant102> ... Appearantly you need to _name_ your inputs. ;)
[13:24:05] <ch3mical> Yes
[13:24:32] <Tant102> Seriously. I dont know how many webdeveloper debugging thingies I've loaded in firefox, and none even as little as hinted that something may be wrong...
[13:24:34] <ch3mical> You can usually get away without naming them, but only if you're nothing doing anything special with them
[13:24:34] <illmatix> can i use a selector for the start of an id?
[13:24:52] <illmatix> and have it get anything that has #food-
[13:25:01] <ch3mical> illmatix: $('[id^="start"]')
[13:25:11] <illmatix> perfect!
[13:25:14] <ch3mical> where start = #food-
[13:25:35] <ch3mical> well drop the #
[13:25:41] <bittyx-laptop> hmm, i'm not quite sure i understand how the iframe hack works. one example i've found is just one line of code that binds an .onsubmit function to the form, where the function just changes the target to a hidden iframe. now, how does that work?
[13:25:41] <Tant102> Can I magically get a <form> to use something else than get/post?
[13:25:48] <ch3mical> Since it's looking at the attribute directly
[13:25:54] <snover> bittyx-laptop: what do you mean, how does that work?
[13:26:45] <ch3mical> Tant102: "magically"?
[13:26:51] <bittyx-laptop> snover: as in, why couldn't i just put target="hidden_iframe_id" in the <form> tag by default? why does the javascript make that work?
[13:26:57] <k_89> Tant102, js : http://pastebin.com/UnQZwmFF , html: http://pastebin.com/TqsEpSXH , php: http://pastebin.com/XmtZD7EE
[13:27:06] <snover> bittyx-laptop: you could do that. and it would work.
[13:28:09] <snover> it would be a pretty shit experience for your users though since they would have no idea when the submission was done without any JS
[13:28:44] <k_89> Tant102, ignore the canvas part, just put these files in your local server and have a folder named uploads in the same directory
[13:28:52] <k_89> and watch it work
[13:29:49] <bittyx-laptop> snover: oh. but could i do something like $('#hidde_iframe_id').load( /* some handler to notify the user of the upload success/failure */ );
[13:30:13] <snover> bittyx-laptop: great except for anyone that doesnâ€™t have javascript enabled
[13:30:27] <snover> since then the form will still submit to the invisible iframe
[13:30:36] <bittyx-laptop> snover: oh, that. yeah, i get it.
[13:30:40] <snover> (this is why it is set in javascript)
[13:30:55] <bittyx-laptop> snover: thanks. i've been working for 12 hours straight, and i think my ability to code is rapidly declining.
[13:31:09] <snover> time for a beer
[13:31:29] <bittyx-laptop> actually, i was planning on working a few more hours (got some deadlines to meet). i've made myself a coffe.
[13:31:29] <ssh71> Is there vsdoc.js file available for jquery 1.5 or 1.6, only found one for 1.4.1 ?
[13:31:34] <bittyx-laptop> s/coffe/coffee/
[13:32:26] <snover> irish coffee?
[13:32:37] <bittyx-laptop> i wish.
[13:33:03] <Giverny> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAeZTgRuWsU JQuery on term
[13:33:31] <Giverny> webkit + javascript + jquery + json + node.js + jquery

[13:36:15] <reli> hi, is there a way to get only a portion of the result from a ajax request?
[13:36:29] <Wulf> reli: sure
[13:36:59] <reli> this is what i have so far http://jsfiddle.net/KpCtR/
[13:37:32] <reli> could you give me a tip on how to do it
[13:39:23] <m0dmd> other than knowing that the cloud helps google autocomplete run extremely fast.
[13:39:33] <m0dmd> how would you fellas think it is setup
[13:39:49] <m0dmd> strictly ajax
[13:40:15] <m0dmd> i ask because i'm trying to determine how to achieve the quickest autocomplete with a database
[13:41:44] <Wulf> reli: html($('tag',data).text() maybe
[13:41:49] <m0dmd> wulf any clue
[13:41:56] <Wulf> ) at the end
[13:42:08] <Whirl3d> if you need to monitor the position of an element and can't be sure of all the events that would indicate a change in position on the element, is it terrible practice to setup an interval check and if not, how long between intervals to keep from mucking up the page?
[13:42:23] <Wulf> m0dmd: not really.
[13:43:11] <m0dmd> i'm storing music in a database but trying to think of the best way to get the data to the autocomplete
[13:43:22] <ch3mical> m0dmd: here's how google does it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blB_X38YSxQ
[13:43:24] <m0dmd> is file access quicker than database aaccess
[13:43:47] <m0dmd> because I can make it so a file is appended everytime an entry is created.
[13:43:53] <m0dmd> And use that as the source of autocomplete.
[13:44:04] <m0dmd> Which would probably be quicker than autocomplete ajax
[13:44:26] <m0dmd> But that would probably defy the use of a database. if I'm using a file to store data which is not good.
[13:44:39] <gnarf> m0dmd: when you asked this question yesterday, 2 or 3 people suggested databases
[13:45:04] <m0dmd> gnarf i asked it the same way?
[13:45:09] <m0dmd> you sure I said file or database!
[13:45:15] <gnarf> yes
[13:45:26] <m0dmd> alright no doubt just getting sidetracked by the speed man
[13:45:27] <gnarf> ?logs
[13:45:27] <bot-t> Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[13:45:31] <m0dmd> it's not promizing
[13:45:50] <gnarf> m0dmd: gotta make your server respond quicker then
[13:45:53] <m0dmd> this guy created a modded autocomplete with caching
[13:46:05] <m0dmd> but it's slower than the autocomplete plugin from jquery-ui
[13:46:14] <m0dmd> even with a simple array as the example specifies
[13:46:16] <gnarf> ui autocomplete has caching if you want it to
[13:46:25] <m0dmd> https://github.com/rcarver/jquery-autocomplete
[13:46:30] <gnarf> use a custom source/response function
[13:46:34] <m0dmd> alright
[13:46:50] <m0dmd> this guys plugin made me sidetrack myself
[13:46:53] <m0dmd> :(
[13:48:05] <gnarf> m0dmd: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery/2011-05-21#T3898700
[13:48:10] <reli> @wulf thanks for you help, it does not work, but at least your idea puts me in the right direction
[13:54:49] <m0dmd> gnarf thanx.
[13:55:55] <TC_> I changed: http://pastebin.com/Fe3TT7fy into http://pastebin.com/mYGKxEge I have 1 process (heartbeat) running at any given time. Exception of new messages, and sending them.
[13:56:31] <TC_> So it should reduce the change of 500's
[13:58:03] <snover> TC_: Iâ€™m not entirely clear that you understand what a 500 ISE is
[13:58:30] <TC_> 500 = Internal server error. I had 2 simultaneous ajax calls going on. at the same time.
[13:58:41] <TC_> the 500 occurred for no specific reason as of yet.
[13:58:54] <TC_> So I'm assuming it could of happened on either php files the ajax calls were using.
[13:59:04] <TC_> meaning... more of a chance of it occuring.
[13:59:17] <TC_> so by taking one away, there are less processes and probably less of a chance of a 500.
[14:02:36] <njbair> I need to select all of an element that does not have a given class. how do i do this?
[14:02:39] <snover> TC_: Changing the client-side code is not a solution to a server error
[14:06:05] <knapper_tech> i have a set of divs i'm loading that have their own custom animation functions for showing and hiding themselves.  they are loaded by ajax from a view.  i'm doing this to decouple the writing of the divs and their display on pages.
[14:06:25] <knapper_tech> i want to call the function for those divs without knowing what that function's name is per div
[14:06:50] <knapper_tech> i'd like to associate the function with the div so i can do something more like $(#thatdiv).animate();
[14:07:11] <knapper_tech> can i use data or something to get a function name defined in a particular div?
[14:07:21] <knapper_tech> or will i have to much namespace collision?
[14:08:32] <knapper_tech> i'm open to creative solutions like dynamically defineing functions or loading the script separately in ajax.  whatever is elegant and keeps the div's decoupled from the page where they're displayed
[14:09:47] <knapper_tech> i guess i'm saying i want to treat my divs like objects that should have defined methods.  div.yourSpecificAnimationFunction
[14:10:11] <Giverny> knapper_tech make object literals
[14:10:36] <Giverny> knapper_tech do you know?
[14:11:35] <Giverny> knapper_tech you can use jquery for divs and class
[14:11:43] <Giverny> knapper_tech and tags
[14:12:46] <Giverny> knapper_tech $("#namediv") $(".nameclass") $("p") <- Tag
[14:13:21] <Giverny> you can add and remove class
[14:13:29] <Giverny> and put events and more
[14:13:34] <Giverny> with selector
[14:14:00] <Giverny> knapper_tech jquery is this
[14:14:28] <Giverny> with in javascript var Div = getElementByid("");
[14:14:39] <knapper_tech> k
[14:14:52] <knapper_tech> can i call a method defined in Div?
[14:14:59] <Giverny> yes
[14:15:12] <knapper_tech> and if there are several divs with the method, MyMethod
[14:15:12] <Giverny> you can
[14:15:30] <Giverny> yes too
[14:15:39] <knapper_tech> when i call ThisDiv.MyMethod, will it grab ThisDiv's specific definition?
[14:15:59] <snover> knapper_tech: sounds like you are looking for dojo.
[14:16:08] <snover> more specifically, dijit widgets
[14:16:22] <knapper_tech> i failed at getting into dojango
[14:16:32] <knapper_tech> but there's always next time =)
[14:16:53] <Giverny> knapper_tech $("#mydiv").wrap(function(){ MyMethod });
[14:17:06] <Giverny> knapper_tech you can use objects
[14:17:12] <Giverny> and more...
[14:17:28] <knapper_tech> know a good example for this type of thing?
[14:17:30] <snover> Giverny: I donâ€™t think you understand what is being requested
[14:17:38] <Giverny> snover yes
[14:17:47] <^robertj> hrmm, keypress event is not firing but not etting any warnings or errors got $("#body").keypress(alert);
[14:18:06] <Giverny> snover he`s talking... i donÂ´t know.. lol
[14:18:51] <knapper_tech> i feel like we're getting there
[14:18:53] <TC_> Snover, what I mean is... calling two PHP files, ... with no actual answer as  to why the 500's are occuring.. creates more risk of one occuring than calling one PHP file.
[14:18:58] <TC_> thats what im ena
[14:19:18] <snover> er
[14:19:23] <snover> no?
[14:19:31] <TC_> ...
[14:19:39] <TC_> er
[14:19:40] <TC_> yes?
[14:19:54] <Giverny> ^robertj $("body").wrap(function(){ alert(""); });
[14:20:08] <snover> Giverny: wrap does not do what you think it does bro
[14:20:42] <snover> If you have 9000 scripts and one of them is written badly and the others are written correctly, putting everything into the one badly written script is not going to decrease the number of errors you generate
[14:21:03] <lisak> is object1 still a reference to the same object if I do this $.extend(object1, object2);
[14:21:09] <TC_> If the 500 happens on everyone file being called randomly (for whatever reason) then instead of calling TWO every 1 second, just call ONE. ...
[14:21:26] <^robertj> so why is .keypress not firing?
[14:21:34] <TC_> so instead of a ... 50% chance of it happening, it reduces to 25% due to 1 less file
[14:21:42] <Giverny> snover heÂ´s just learning jquery..
[14:21:46] <snover> ?p @ ^robertj
[14:21:46] <bot-t> ^robertj, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:21:58] <lisak> I see it doesn't return
[14:22:26] <Giverny> snover notÂ´s good way make great references...
[14:22:40] <^robertj> http://webclient.caskeytranscription.com/thick/js/ButtonSlotContainer.js
[14:22:41] <snover> TC_: You donâ€™t have any data to back up that assertion.
[14:23:01] <snover> you yourself have said that the reason is unknown
[14:23:09] <Giverny> ^robertj http://jquery.com/
[14:23:15] <Giverny> knapper_tech http://jquery.com/
[14:23:15] <ravenzz> $("#body").keypress(alert); wat?
[14:23:18] <Giverny> documentation
[14:23:41] <Giverny> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[14:23:50] <TC_> Yes, it's unknown. The script gets killed before any headers are sent out. So it's impossible to know also... http://vvcap.net/db/xELH8qTQ4NlBMyu3x4Zv.htp < This one here won't stop loading... it's dead.
[14:24:11] <^robertj> ravenzz, wont that hook up alert to the keypress signal on the element with id="body"?
[14:24:16] <bittyx-laptop> i'm doing some .show()/.hide() stuff with items on my page (filtering them according to some tags, and each tag has it's own button). i'm using the 'fold' effect to show/hide those items. everything works alright, but i've noticed, having firebug open, that each time some element gets hidden, some divs with class "ui-effects-wrapper" are created in the DOM. can, after using too much effects, the DOM get too polluted with them? is there any simp
[14:24:16] <bittyx-laptop> le way to clean them up without doing any damage to the page? i was thinking to do something like $("div.ui-effects-wrapper:hidden").remove(); but i'm not sure if that's something i should be doing at all. should i leave it alone?
[14:25:23] <snover> TC_: if only there was some sort of error logging facility in either the system, the http server, or php itself, but I guess there isnâ€™t, because nobody has ever had a need for such a thing before â€¦
[14:25:30] <ravenzz> ^robertj $('#body').keypress(function(){ alert('foo'); });
[14:25:31] <bittyx-laptop> there's a demo here: http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji <--- the two tag lists on top, titled "Vrsta dogadjaja" and "Vrsta muzike" are what you should be clicking on, if you want to see what i mean (turn them all off, for example). keep firebug open in the HTML mode, with "Expand Changes" checked.
[14:25:47] <TC_> How can I actually debug a page that doesn't even get a response in the first place...
[14:25:57] <Giverny> sorry i donÂ´t speak a good english
[14:26:00] <Giverny> :)
[14:26:00] <TC_> php is out of the question.
[14:26:05] <Giverny> itÂ´s poor english
[14:26:07] <Giverny> only
[14:26:15] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: uh, why is it out of the question?
[14:26:16] <snover> ?lmgtfy debugging php errors @ TC_
[14:26:17] <bot-t> TC_, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=debugging+php+errors
[14:26:20] <^robertj> ravenzz, also tried that, no joy
[14:26:23] <ravenzz> TC_ make a request to that page directly
[14:26:28] <Giverny> TC_ you can use console.log("");
[14:26:37] <Giverny> for debug your js code
[14:26:42] <^robertj> at least in ff
[14:26:43] <Giverny> ?
[14:26:43] <snover> ^robertj: you cannot bind stuff before the dom is ready.
[14:26:51] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: if you are getting a 500 server error, that means you ARE getting a response.
[14:26:52] <TC_> Yes, there is a php error within <?php ?>  < I think not bro.
[14:26:57] <^robertj> looks like it does work in ie
[14:27:01] <TC_> Fine, a response... but no header.
[14:27:08] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: that also means that the script failed.
[14:27:12] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: that means the error is in the script.
[14:27:16] <snover> TC_: what do you think â€œHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Errorâ€ is, exactly?
[14:27:18] <snover> itâ€™s not NOT a header
[14:27:24] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: the 500 server error is a header.
[14:27:27] <bittyx-laptop> yeah.
[14:27:31] <ravenzz> ^robertj also i suppose that #body has to be focused...but dunno if you can focus a div
[14:27:38] <TC_> There is NO script.
[14:27:41] <^robertj> ravenzz, it is focused in this instance
[14:27:43] <TC_> it's just a php tag >.<
[14:27:48] <^robertj> may be a dom loading issue
[14:27:52] <Giverny> php tag?
[14:27:57] <Giverny> not is a php tag
[14:28:01] <Giverny> lol
[14:28:01] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: what's the page url?
[14:28:04] <Giverny> tag is HTML
[14:28:15] <bittyx-laptop> Giverny: <?php is the opening php tag
[14:28:20] <bittyx-laptop> Giverny: ?> is the closing php tag
[14:28:21] <TC_> You need login access and it may take up to 6 hours for something to occur.
[14:28:28] <bittyx-laptop> Giverny: the thing they have in common is, they are both php tags.
[14:28:51] <Giverny> bittyx-laptop yes is a unic tag of php
[14:29:02] <TC_> [Sun May 22 05:13:44 2011] [error] [client 87.102.72.153] Premature end of script headers: php53, referer: <my url here> - My host also said : It seems to confirm what we've been exploring, that a script is getting killed before starting, or at least before it can output headers.
[14:29:13] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: if you are getting a 500 server error, that has nothing to do with javascript - it's either an error in the script (a php error), but you say it isn't, so it can only be a server error.
[14:29:32] <snover> TC_: so youâ€™ve done something to cause php to crash or get stuck in an infinite loop
[14:29:34] <ravenzz> ^robertj http://jsfiddle.net/kcC7N/1/
[14:29:51] <TC_> No loops, at all. Just.. an open and close php tag.
[14:30:05] <snover> TC_: time to find a competent web host then i guess.
[14:30:14] <ioneepar> var a = $('<a ...<a/>'); $(this).before(a); a.click(); No? Click handler isnt being triggered.
[14:30:37] <snover> unless you yourself have done something like configured php to automatically start sessions
[14:30:48] <ioneepar> Oh, have livequery on the handler btw
[14:30:53] <TC_> It's server related I'm sure. Maybe due to the process limit, hnce why running to .ajax calls at the same given time,  counts as TWO processes. Slimming it down to ONE, decreases the amount of processes - allowing a much less likelier to reach the limit.
[14:30:57] <TC_> HENCE what I was trying to say
[14:31:42] <bittyx-laptop> TC_: http://gallery.menalto.com/node/8955
[14:31:56] <mackry>  When hovering over a small picture, I'm trying to place a zoomed in picture over top of it. Then, inside the zoomed in picture is a close button that will remove itself. When removed, and the user is still hovering over the small picture, I don't want the zoomed picture to appear until the user has mouseout'd of it and re-entered. Having a bit of trouble doing something like this  ex: jsfiddle.net/mackry/RgymF/4
[14:31:59] <bittyx-laptop> it's some proprietary forum, but it has some info
[14:32:04] <Giverny> ioneepar you just can get $("a") of links
[14:32:07] <KWhat_Mobile> is there a way to do something after an event ive bound to gets fired?  For example bind to a click event, i would like to run code after that event has completed?
[14:32:21] <snover> bittyx-laptop: if the problem is intermittent, itâ€™s not caused by a permissions issue
[14:32:29] <snover> or anything that form post says
[14:32:30] <snover> forum*
[14:32:35] <Giverny> ioneepar you can put childs and others
[14:32:38] <ioneepar> Giverny: I dont follow
[14:32:40] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: that link doesn't work for me
[14:32:52] <TC_> I don't know how it would reach the process limit with the small amount of processes going on, but I tried. Let me read the post.
[14:32:54] <madjoe> is there any reason why selectionStart and selectionEnd doesn't work for IE8?
[14:32:57] <bittyx-laptop> snover: i have no idea to be honest, i'm just giving out suggestions
[14:33:01] <Giverny> ioneepar you can use .find('')
[14:33:05] <Giverny> and more..
[14:33:30] <snover> well, the last thing on my list of things I want to do is troubleshoot someoneâ€™s worthless shared hosting :)
[14:34:07] <ioneepar> Giverny: Em, Im not sure you understand my question. Its about how to trigger the click event on a newly inserted element...
[14:34:10] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: http://jsfiddle.net/RgymF/4/
[14:34:38] <TC_> Action application/x-hg-php53 /cgi-sys/php53 AddType application/x-hg-php53 .php  < Is in my .htaccess. It's also a requirement. I don't see any CGI scripts, but I'm not sure I have access to the http-conf
[14:35:34] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: i have no idea what that is, but it's causing my browser to crash.
[14:35:51] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: it crashed my firefox on ubuntu, as well as firefox on win7
[14:35:56] <snover> oh, hostgator. good luck with that dude.
[14:35:58] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: yeah, that's what I'm having trouble with.
[14:36:12] <^robertj> ravenzz, same problem with that code
[14:36:26] <^robertj> ravenzz, http://webclient.caskeytranscription.com/thick/ has the page calling it
[14:36:32] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: no clue why it's flickering on hover and causing a crash
[14:37:03] <TC_> but aside from this issue, any idea why an ajax call may be hanging? http://vvcap.net/db/xELH8qTQ4NlBMyu3x4Zv.htp
[14:37:05] <solars> hey, does anyone know if I can specify a custom validation that is not bound to a particular form field but lets me do general things and just return true/false?
[14:42:29] <Wilson29thID> hello gents
[14:42:48] <Wilson29thID> Is there a way to .focus() on an element without triggering the focus hooks?
[14:43:09] <TC_> jesus christ. 55.18s for a single ajax call :'( some of them never complete.
[14:43:23] <Wilson29thID> Basically, I have a datepicker and I need it to focus back on the text box after a date is selected, but I don't want that focus() to trigger the re-opening of the datepicker again
[14:44:10] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: http://jsfiddle.net/RgymF/9/ <--- is this what you want?
[14:44:53] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: ah, i've just realized it doesn't quite work yet, but at least it doesn't hang my browser anymore.
[14:45:19] <snover> TC_: the default session handling functions in php use file locking and cause requests to be serialized. use different session handling or close your sessions manually.
[14:45:26] <snover> I have told many other people this
[14:45:36] <^robertj> ravenzz, im a bad person, i didn't have it focused
[14:45:37] <snover> because many other people have also written exactly the same thing as you
[14:45:43] <snover> why are you reinventing the wheel?
[14:45:46] <^robertj> i had ... err, what's behind the page where no body is?
[14:45:49] <TC_> I don't use sessions for what I'm doing. I know php.ini isn't set to auto start them either
[14:46:13] <bittyx-laptop> may i repost my question since it sorta got completely ignored, and i doubt anyone's gonna see it now?
[14:46:14] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: very close! Still need mouseleave to remove the big element, and also, when a user clicks  "Close"  and the user is still hovering over the small picture, I don't want the zoomed picture to appear until the user has mouseout'd of it and re-entered
[14:46:52] <Wilson29thID> By god I've got it! thanks anyway
[14:46:56] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: to be honest, i'd rather zoom the picture on mousedown than mouseenter - i'd be pretty annoyed by auto-zooming pictures when i move my mose around the page.
[14:47:21] <bittyx-laptop> mackry: but just figure out when you need to bind the events again, and when you should unbind events
[14:47:46] <TC_> http://vvcap.net/db/V5msso7UzDpn5rdQ8H7N.htp what doe this mean? >.<
[14:47:57] <KWhat_Mobile> is there a way to run code after an event fires?
[14:48:00] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: I'll give it a go off what you did
[14:49:27] <bittyx-laptop> when using certain jqueryui effects, you can see ui-effect-wrapper divs popping up in the DOM. is there a way to clean these up? can they cause issues if there's too many of them? i was thinking something like $("div.ui-effects-wrapper:hidden").remove(), but i'm not sure if that's gonna stop something from working (it probably will)
[14:49:49] <snover> bittyx-laptop: try it and see, I guess
[14:49:57] <mackry> bittyx-laptop: Ah, I need to use delegate or live for newly appended images.
[14:50:20] <bittyx-laptop> snover: i'm asking because i'm assuming i'm not the first person to ask myself (or others) this question
[14:50:28] <snover> bittyx-laptop: i think you might be.
[14:50:53] <bittyx-laptop> snover: well in that case, the answer to my original question is probably "don't worry about it, it won't cause any issues"
[14:55:30] <knapper_tech> setTimeout lets everything after the timeout execute...what i want to resume execution of a function after 300ms or something.  should i just use a setTimeout pattern and call the rest of the function?
[14:55:53] <knapper_tech> jquery have any solutions to this quandry?
[14:57:21] <wkmanire_> knapper_tech: So you want to pause the timeout and then resume it from where you left off at a later time?
[14:58:02] <knapper_tech> the very specific problem is that i'm animating two different elements, and i want the second to animate after the first animation completes
[14:58:20] <wkmanire_> Are you using jQuery animations or is it custom?
[14:58:38] <knapper_tech> just calling $('#this).fadeIn(500); and $('#that').fadeOut(500); doesn't make the two animations sequential
[14:58:40] <ch3mical> knapper_tech: For delaying in a jQuery chain, see ?.delay()
[14:58:41] <bot-t> knapper_tech, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:58:58] <wkmanire_> $('#this').fadeIn(500, function () {
[14:59:07] <wkmanire_> $('#that').fadeOut(500);
[14:59:17] <knapper_tech> hmmm.  guess that's more elegant
[14:59:17] <wkmanire_> but fix the syntax
[14:59:31] <knapper_tech> i'lll give it a try and see if anything else pops up in the way.
[14:59:32] <ch3mical> $('#this').fadeIn().delay(x).fadeout()
[15:00:07] <wkmanire_> All of the animations have callback functions that are executed when the animation completes.
[15:00:33] <knapper_tech> that's nice.  seems clean.
[15:00:40] <ch3mical> wkmanire_: But then he's only delaying for the specified time of the fade duration
[15:00:49] <wkmanire_> Thats true
[15:01:00] <wkmanire_> it depends on how much control you need and what kind of effect you're going for.
[15:01:04] <TC_> if(((e.keyCode || e.which) === 13)) this doens't seem to be working on IE8 or 7
[15:01:06] <ch3mical> Exactly
[15:01:32] <wkmanire_> TC_: IE has a different event model than *EVERYONE* else.
[15:01:33] <ch3mical> ?g IE8 keycode javascript
[15:01:34] <bot-t> ch3mical, JavaScript KeyCode Values are "undefined" in Internet Explorer 8 ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1750223/javascript-keycode-values-are-undefined-in-internet-explorer-8
[15:01:57] <wkmanire_> TC: You have to get the key from the global Event object in your event handler.
[15:03:00] <ch3mical> *eyeroll* Microsoft always has to be DIFFERENT...
[15:03:01] <TC_> I have this though:  $("input[name=message]").keydown(function(e) {
[15:03:11] <TC_> it worked before, can't figure out what's different now
[15:03:37] <snover> keydown, keypress, and keyup populate different stuff
[15:04:08] <wkmanire_> TC_: you're using jQuery right?
[15:04:08] <TC_> fack.
[15:04:16] <TC_> I had message = $("...
[15:04:21] <TC_> should of been... var message = $("...
[15:04:32] <wkmanire_> yeah you are. so it should be all abstracted away
[15:04:36] <wkmanire_> I'll review the docs
[15:05:03] <ch3mical> mmmm abstraction
[15:05:13] <wkmanire_> I see the problem.
[15:05:22] <wkmanire_> In the documentation they do an == comparison vs. '13'
[15:05:29] <wkmanire_> you are doing an === comparison vs. 13
[15:05:39] <ch3mical> That shouldn't matter
[15:05:54] <wkmanire_> It does because 13 !== '13'
[15:06:05] <ch3mical> === makes it not care
[15:06:09] <wkmanire_> No
[15:06:13] <wkmanire_> === does a reference comparison.
[15:06:20] <wkmanire_> They are the same object or they are not.
[15:06:22] <ch3mical> What am I thinking of then?
[15:06:37] <wkmanire_> == is coercive. it casts both sides before doing the comparison.
[15:06:48] <wkmanire_> one or both sides rather.
[15:07:43] <wkmanire_> TC_: Try changing your code to check == '13' and see if that makes it work in IE
[15:07:48] <ch3mical> Oh right, I had it backwards
[15:07:54] <ch3mical> === is the stricter
[15:08:00] <TC_> I already said, it should of been... var message = $("...
[15:08:03] <TC_> it was breaking due to something else
[15:08:08] <wkmanire_> oh... I missed it.
[15:08:08] <wkmanire_> sorry
[15:08:13] <TC_> but I do have this issue: if(((e.keyCode || e.which) === 13) && ((e.keyCode || e.which) !== 16))
[15:08:21] <TC_> I ony want to send messages when enter is pressed.
[15:08:23] <TC_> not shift + enter
[15:08:34] <TC_> but it's still doing shift... >.<
[15:08:43] <wkmanire_> You check shift, alt and ctrl differently.
[15:08:45] <TC_> wait my logic is screwed.
[15:08:48] <wkmanire_> They are properties of the event object.
[15:08:49] <TC_> oh
[15:09:14] <wkmanire_> Since any combination of the 3 may be held down when the event is triggered.
[15:10:08] <TC_> e.shiftKey ?
[15:10:45] <wkmanire_> Yes
[15:10:54] <wkmanire_> e.shiftKey, e.altKey, e.ctrlKey
[15:10:58] <wkmanire_> They will be true or false.
[15:12:00] <TC_> yeah that works.
[15:12:02] <TC_> thanks.
[15:12:05] <wkmanire_> :)
[15:12:25] * wkmanire_ is hungry. brb
[15:13:18] <Whirl3d> Quick question: an anchor with href='#topic' shouldn't pass the string "//#topic" should it in $(anchor).attr("href");
[15:13:47] <TC_> but still, why would an .ajax call hang?
[15:13:56] <TC_> like it doesn't... ever ever ever complete.
[15:14:00] <TC_> just keeps trying to load
[15:15:19] <Whirl3d> <--my recent experience with .ajax is the same. It is completley unflexible with dataTypes or errors in html. It will not complete if I have a single html error--plus it gives no error  (that's been my experience, so don't everyone yell at me at once)
[15:17:38] <ironfroggy_> is there a way to select all the siblings of an element that appear before it?
[15:22:08] <TC_> i put in a timeout for the ajax call, and allowed it to continue if it did timeout. uhm
[15:22:48] <bittyx-laptop> is it good practice to have some code like $('#id').unbind('click').click( function() {...}); ?
[15:24:45] <ironfroggy_> bittyx-laptop: not really. that would trample on anything else binding to that.
[15:25:08] <ironfroggy_> if you find yourself wanting to do things like that, you probably need to decouple some of your components a bit better so you dont run into whatever problem you think that will fix.
[15:26:33] <ch3mical> What's that plugin that formats things on a page all pretty-like? Images, for instance...
[15:26:40] <ch3mical> Can't remember
[15:26:46] <ch3mical> :/
[15:27:28] <ch3mical> It organizes divs to fit together so without leaving empty areas
[15:27:33] <ch3mical> -so
[15:27:48] <ch3mical> argh
[15:28:39] <ch3mical> M-something?
[15:28:45] <bittyx-laptop> ironfroggy_: i'm not binding any other click events to that element; i'm just sort of "rebinding" it, based on some other stuff. so i should probably rethink this, hm?
[15:28:47] <ch3mical> modal? Hmm
[15:30:03] <ch3mical> blargh
[15:30:24] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: maybe you're thinking of isotope?
[15:30:39] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[15:32:36] <ch3mical> No, it was a different one, but that looks like it will do
[15:32:58] <ch3mical> Does this handle clearing divs as well?
[15:33:56] <ch3mical> Oh, masonry, either that was the name or it used that word a lot on their demo site
[15:34:41] <ch3mical> Hmm.. they both look good
[15:35:06] <reli> u know in ajax you have the success: complete: -- which is the one where you add a spinner whilst waiting for the content
[15:35:07] <ch3mical> Which do you think would be better for organizing a configuration page (just a bunch of divs full of various config options)?
[15:35:28] <ch3mical> reli: use .ajaxStart()
[15:35:34] <ch3mical> see ?.ajaxStart()
[15:35:34] <bot-t> .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[15:36:23] <ch3mical> Or to make it run even if another AJAX is running see ?.ajaxSend()
[15:36:44] * ch3mical shakes his fist at bot-t
[15:36:56] <reli> cool i'll try them both
[15:36:58] <ch3mical> *ahem* see ?.ajaxSend()
[15:37:18] <ch3mical> Damn you, bot-t, damn youuuuu.
[15:50:56] <^robertj> hrmm, how can I set a variable within an anonymous function? foo.x = 342 function foo() {alert x} wasn't the trick

[16:06:01] <bittyx-laptop> Rex_: yeah, i've realized i solve many of my problems just by trying to narrow it down for pasting/asking for help
[16:06:28] <bittyx-laptop> Zerxer: yeah, that's sort of an ouch.
[16:06:29] <Zerxer> irc is against me
[16:06:33] <Zerxer> :D
[16:06:40] <Zerxer> it reminds me to check in on channels, at least
[16:09:55] <ch3mical> Rex_: $( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", "height", 530 );
[16:10:03] <ch3mical> Rex_: same for width
[16:11:03] <ch3mical> maxHeight and maxWidth are also options you might be interested in
[16:15:45] <^robertj> coldhead, i need to lazy eval that so that i add to the argument list of params getting pased into the wrapped function
[16:21:04] <coldhead> ^robertj: http://jsfiddle.net/LGVuW/ something like this maybe?
[16:21:17] <wolfe> mwhahaa, beware, I'm armed with jQuery and not afraid to use it
[16:21:21] <^robertj> damn
[16:21:32] <metallico> hi guys, do you see anything wrong with this http://pastebin.com/C6gzu2yY
[16:21:41] <coldhead> lol wolfe
[16:22:05] <metallico> fadein/fadeout doesnt work in IE8
[16:22:14] <wolfe> this is easier than ext/dojo :o
[16:22:23] <wolfe> esp styling existing stuff
[16:23:01] <coldhead> wolfe: it's very write less, do more
[16:23:21] <wolfe> I can see that
[16:23:25] <^robertj> coldhead, i'm not sure that will work either, i'm trying to get at this, but it is getting clobbered
[16:23:36] <^robertj> I'v got an object this, that is defining a callback
[16:23:37] <coldhead> metallico: that looks very complicated -- you couldn't use something like hoverintent or debounce?
[16:23:46] <^robertj> but when the callback gets called it has the object being dropped as this
[16:24:15] <^robertj> so i'm tryint to find a way to package in the object with the function definition so i can get at it later on the drop: handler
[16:24:21] <coldhead> ^robertj: see where i have var args = arguments? try something like that: var that = this; and then refer to that within your fn
[16:24:43] * ^robertj tries
[16:24:50] <wolfe> This jQuery user interface book from packetpub is quite nice
[16:24:54] <metallico> coldhead, what do you think is the best plugin for this job?
[16:25:26] <coldhead> metallico: i don't quite follow your code but give a cursory glance over these and see if they help you
[16:25:31] <coldhead> ?ba debounce @ metallico

[16:25:57] <coldhead> forgive me if those are not appropriate, i am quite new at jQuery
[16:28:36] <^robertj> coldhead, yeah already been clobbered by then
[16:29:13] <wolfe> I'm new, but I've used many toolkits :P

[16:39:38] <wolfe> djQuery: tell me, is there integration for calendar controlls and other widgets in data cells ?
[16:40:03] <djQuery> think so
[16:40:09] <wolfe> given last I looked, it was quite some time ago, when I was using Ext 2.0( before the Jack Scumbucket fiasco)
[16:40:33] <djQuery> wolfe: dont think the jquery.ui.grid has an edit mode yet

[16:46:25] <Guest64925> everyone
[16:47:00] <coldhead> hi joel
[16:47:02] <punno> hey all, whats the most efficient way of handling a chain of animations/manipulations on an element?
[16:47:11] <Guest64925> hi coldhead
[16:47:15] <punno> rather than nesting callbacks which gets messy
[16:48:33] <coldhead> ?nopm @ Guest64925
[16:48:33] <bot-t> Guest64925, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[16:49:17] <Guest64925> I need to submit a form with jquery
[16:49:25] <Guest64925> the information is not submiting help
[16:49:41] <Iarfen> hi
[16:49:43] <coldhead> show us what you tried, Guest64925
[16:49:48] <coldhead> ?p @ Guest64925
[16:49:48] <bot-t> Guest64925, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[16:52:24] <Guest64925> this is my jsfiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/
[16:52:31] <Guest64925> it is not submitting
[16:52:41] <coldhead> yes, so you mentioned
[16:52:43] <Iarfen> How i can change the OPTION SELECTED on a SELECT with jquery?
[16:53:20] <Guest64925> I want that after clicking on the blabinput then to go and submit the data to the database and display it without browser refresh
[16:55:55] <coldhead> Guest64925: http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/3/
[16:55:56] <coldhead> that seems to work
[16:57:00] <Guest64925> how do I know if it is working with jsfiddle?
[16:57:08] <Guest64925> does it gives some type of feedback
[16:57:09] <Guest64925> ?
[16:57:19] <coldhead> it won't work properly
[16:57:36] <coldhead> if you have firebug or the chrome web dev tools open you can see the POST request happen
[16:57:41] <coldhead> but it fails
[16:57:42] <lisak> could please anybody tell me how to invoke sequential execution in the startUpload method ? http://jsfiddle.net/y3kF2/
[16:57:48] <coldhead> you might have to try it on your actual thingy
[16:57:52] <coldhead> hi lisak
[16:58:05] <coldhead> you ask questions too advanced for me, lisak!
[16:58:39] <lisak> it's to advanced for me either :)
[16:58:48] <m0dmd> anyone recommend something other than jPaginate
[16:59:24] <Whirl3d> where can I get a good list of possible urls to test a parse engine with?
[17:00:11] <reli> is there a google chrome plugin to easily enable and disable javascript?
[17:01:11] <Guest64925> coldhead you mean it won't work properly i should try it in a live server. ? Does it suppose to work with the variables in the  form action? or I should put the variables in the jquery script?
[17:01:49] <m0dmd> jPaginate it is.
[17:02:37] <coldhead> Guest64925: the code i have on jsfiddle is sending the form data to the jsfiddle server. it should work on your live or test server too, and it should work better because the server will handle the form properly
[17:03:02] <coldhead> the way i have it with .attr('action') is a good way to do it
[17:03:38] <Guest64925> so the .attr function with the 'action' valueable is going to parse the url in the action form?
[17:04:29] <coldhead> yes
[17:04:40] <Whirl3d> Who would have thought that it would be hard to find a list of urls to test a filter with?
[17:04:59] <coldhead> Guest64925: POST http://fiddle.jshell.net/EkAeH/3/show/profile.php?id='.$idc.'&ids='.%20$id2.'&name='.$name1.' 404 (NOT FOUND)
[17:05:04] <coldhead> that is what i see in firebug
[17:05:15] <coldhead> so it seems to work
[17:05:17] <Guest64925> ok
[17:05:22] <Guest64925> let me check that
[17:06:00] <coldhead> Whirl3d: i would check the w3c for their docs on what an URL can be, and test the valid and invalid examples i hope they have their
[17:06:10] <coldhead> there*
[17:06:39] <m0dmd> yo coldhead
[17:06:42] <m0dmd> what's up!!
[17:06:49] <m0dmd> hope you're well buddy
[17:07:25] <coldhead> thanks m0dmd, you too
[17:07:53] <Guest64925> hey coldhead it did submit but it submited the whole page with the event as well
[17:08:05] <abjorn> fuck im hungry.
[17:08:10] <abjorn> feed me coldhead!
[17:08:23] <Guest64925> it will display the whole page double inside the form
[17:08:28] <juha___> abjorn: i can feed you
[17:08:31] <abjorn> oh?
[17:08:34] <coldhead> that should not happen, Guest64925
[17:08:41] <coldhead> you must be doing something else
[17:08:44] <juha___> abjorn: yes, i could vomit to your mouth, like a mother bird
[17:08:53] <Guest64925> I know I just looking to update only the jquery event
[17:08:54] <coldhead> ?ldoidh @ Guest64925
[17:08:58] <abjorn> that sounds absolutely delicious, I'll take two helpings please
[17:09:28] <coldhead> you sick little monkeys
[17:09:53] <abjorn> I'm having fajitas for mi hermanas birthday in a little while. But I'm staaarving
[17:10:10] <Guest64925> coldhead
[17:10:23] <juha___> i just ate bowl of noodles and i want to die :D
[17:10:36] <abjorn> that sounds normal
[17:10:40] <Guest64925> I remember that one person told I should send the variables in a input field as hidden
[17:11:56] <Whirl3d> I haven't eaten in a week--just staring at this damned screen day in day out...no sleep, no food....i'm officially a zombie
[17:12:14] <coldhead> that should not be necessary, Guest64925
[17:12:59] <lisak> it seems weird that javascript doesn't have implemented something like array.hasNext()  array.next() methods
[17:13:02] <Guest64925> i thought he might suggest it because of this event
[17:13:10] <coldhead> Guest64925: if you know how to make the form work without ajax then try doing that and then use http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[17:13:20] <coldhead> that makes it much easier for you -- just one line of jQuery
[17:13:30] <Guest64925> yes
[17:13:42] <coldhead> i need to perform ablutions
[17:13:45] <coldhead> good luck
[17:13:58] <Guest64925> But I took the action to see if the action is what is causing the whole page to print inside the form td tags again
[17:14:13] <Guest64925> meaning you are going to take a shit coldhead?
[17:16:45] <hopperfest> On the click of a button I empty() a div, then add a datepicker to it like '$('#mini-calendar').datepicker({ ... }). It works the first time, but the second time the datepicker disappears but never re-appears. Any idea why? Using Firefox I see the datepicker removed and never get re-added but the datepicker call is definitely happening
[17:17:10] <Guest64925> coldhead it is submiting the whole site again
[17:17:30] <juha___> i bet you squeal like a pig
[17:18:41] <coldhead> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lknirte6X01qdmmiqo1_400.gif

[17:20:55] <Funhouse> Hey does anyone use the keith wood countdown plugin?
[17:27:26] <kandinski> hi, I am faced with a legacy mess of javascript, and would like to add some functionality using jquery. My question is should I load jquery before or after the legacy scripts? Thanks.

[17:33:55] <ngharo> Guest64925: http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/8/ is this waht you're trying to do?
[17:34:32] <f00li5h> can anyone recommend a tree mapper plugin?
[17:34:59] <f00li5h> I was looking at one a while back, but some sod re-imaged my machine ...
[17:40:23] <Guest64925> ngharo what't is the #post coming from?
[17:41:16] <ngharo> coming from?
[17:41:42] <Guest64925> I mean where do you take that #post I haven't use any id call that way
[17:41:53] <Guest64925> is that an jquery function or code ?
[17:42:02] <ngharo> you have <form id="post" ... />
[17:42:04] <Guest64925> or you are refereing to id in the form?
[17:42:08] <Guest64925> ok wait
[17:42:25] <ngharo> yep
[17:43:03] <Guest64925> you are rityht
[17:44:33] <ngharo> Guest64925: are those PHP variables in your action?
[17:44:48] <ngharo> $idc, $id2, $name1
[17:46:16] <Guest64925> yes ngharo something wrong with that and jquery?
[17:47:52] <sshow> I have troubles getting an array item. http://jsfiddle.net/F9DUf/ How does this work? arrayVar.get(1); does not work either
[17:48:08] <Guest64925> Ngharo still is not working
[17:48:09] <ngharo> Guest64925: i'd do hidden inputs
[17:48:10] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/12/
[17:48:29] <Guest64925> yes that's why it is not working help with the hidden inputs
[17:48:52] <PW-toXic> hi, is it possible to access "this" on a callback over 2 hierarchies?
[17:49:02] <Guest64925> why you are doing hidden input in this case somebody has suggested it before ?
[17:49:43] <hopperfest> rkh: thanks!!
[17:50:16] <sshow> my bad. turns out value() is not valid on dropdowns. Thanks anyway
[17:50:16] <PW-toXic> im doing something like this: $(..).change(function() { $(..).fadeOut(500, function() {  } ..   and i want to access the element from the first selector
[17:50:56] <sshow> PW-toXic: save 'this' in a var within the first bracket
[17:51:05] <PW-toXic> sshow and how do i then access it?
[17:51:13] <PW-toXic> ah
[17:51:16] <PW-toXic> that = this
[17:51:17] <PW-toXic> you mean
[17:51:21] <sshow> yeah
[17:51:29] <sshow> var firstThis = this;
[17:52:09] <PW-toXic> sshow, thanks.. this works
[17:52:24] <sshow> PW-toXic: glad i could help
[17:52:41] <ngharo> sshow: you prolly want .val()
[17:52:49] <PW-toXic> is was trying to pass the variable in the function(this) body, but i didnt know how to access it then ;)
[17:52:53] <sshow> ngharo: thanks! was just searching
[17:53:53] <ngharo> but you can't call val() on $(foo)[0] or $(foo).get(0)
[17:54:01] <ngharo> because those return DOM nodes
[17:54:02] <sshow> noticed.
[17:54:06] <ngharo> .value might work instead
[17:54:19] <sshow> will I have to get :selected then?
[17:54:44] <sshow> ngharo: value() does not work. but thanks. ill go search
[17:54:57] <ngharo> sshow: value is a property, not a method
[17:55:00] <ngharo> foo.value;
[17:55:17] <Funhouse> do you guys perfer .post or .ajax?
[17:55:25] <sshow> ngharo: learning every day ;) thanks alot
[17:55:29] <guy> ah.. Funhouse what?
[17:55:31] <ngharo> np
[17:55:40] <guy> .post is just .ajax wrapper.
[17:55:59] <ngharo> i prefer using ajax for get/post
[17:56:17] <ngharo> .ajax() *
[17:56:40] <ngharo> unless its just a trivial call i might use the shortcuts
[17:58:24] <Guest64925> ngharo I have this for the jquery plugin <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.form.js"></script>
[17:58:30] <Guest64925> hope this two plugin will work for this

[18:00:19] <sdio> rather than using .appendTo
[18:00:21] <bittyx-laptop> teear: MADNEEEES!
[18:00:39] <teear> hehe
[18:00:57] <pifantastic> sdio: kindof
[18:01:28] <sdio> pifantastic: pointer in the right direction?
[18:01:40] <pifantastic> sdio: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-outerhtml
[18:01:43] <teear> should work by the way guest number x, but you have no idea what you are talking about you dumbnut have you
[18:02:45] <kandinski> hi, I am faced with a legacy mess of javascript, and would like to add some functionality using jquery. My question is should I load jquery before or after the legacy scripts? Thanks.
[18:03:17] <teear> if i wanted a jquery plugin for my website, i would go to github and get laught at
[18:03:48] <tnorris> kandinski: shouldn't really matter, if you use noConflict()
[18:04:18] <teear> you should allways load the jquery before any jquerying you dumbnut
[18:04:40] <ngharo> kandinski: you could use jQuery.noConflict() if you're worried about $ var collisions
[18:04:53] <kandinski> tnorris and ngharo, thanks
[18:05:01] <teear> If you drink beer you can jeequery afterwards
[18:05:25] <kandinski> I am new to javascript and jquery, and yes, I want to eliminate unwanted interactions
[18:05:59] <teear> jquery first and the code after
[18:06:15] <teear> but
[18:06:28] <teear> do not mistake that for a gogo
[18:06:37] <kandinski> ok, so the next step is to look for a visual textarea editor. Can you guys recommend one that's lightweight?
[18:06:46] <teear> if you cannot yeequery that's a no no
[18:07:01] <ngharo> teear: what the hell are you babbling on about?
[18:07:33] <teear> that kandinski fellow thinks he is the beethowen of jquery coding
[18:07:38] <teear> that dumbnut
[18:08:03] <ngharo> lol
[18:08:23] <kandinski> isn't teear a markov bot?
[18:08:41] <teear> even if he has drinken quite a few bears i think he cannot even jquery from a database
[18:08:48] <pifantastic> oh
[18:08:50] <kandinski> sounds like one
[18:08:53] <pifantastic> that would explain it
[18:10:38] <teear> that was a long time ago, but once i danced with markov
[18:10:59] <teear> he had such lovely nice tight ass
[18:11:26] <astropirate> am i in the right #?
[18:11:30] <astropirate> :S
[18:11:35] <teear> something that is never really seen on internet because us people would sensorize that ass
[18:12:16] <teear> it was like a cherry pie
[18:12:22] <teear> with pudding on top
[18:13:14] <gnarf> kandinski: what are you looking for from an editor?
[18:13:16] <teear> you yanks are dangerous
[18:13:19] <gnarf> like full html?
[18:13:51] <teear> but that pudding pie that was like a million marshmellow candies on my pillow and I said wait wat
[18:13:55] <gnarf> teear: can we stay mildly on topic and try not to insult / offend people?
[18:14:05] <kandinski> gnarf, no, just configurable tags for b, i, em, blockquote, not much more
[18:14:17] <gnarf> kandinski: i really like using Markdown for stuff like that
[18:14:24] <kandinski> gnarf: it's for end lusers
[18:14:35] <gnarf> kandinski: markdown is pretty fn' easy to explain
[18:14:41] <teear> I'm trying not to offend people but you yanks get so easily fustrated
[18:14:42] <kandinski> I like Markdown too, but users demand clicky buttons
[18:14:46] <ngharo> ckeditor has a simple mode
[18:14:59] <kandinski> ckeditor interacts badly with the legacy javascript
[18:15:01] <kandinski> tried it already
[18:15:26] <kandinski> also it does something where it drops spaces just before or after <a> elements
[18:15:31] <kandinski> really messy
[18:15:42] <teear> If I was a yankee I would Hoppa with my Grasshoppa and lookka for some lately brewed cannabis
[18:16:14] <kandinski> so I thought I'd try a jquery based editor, probably better architected
[18:16:34] <kandinski> teear: most of us on the Internet aren't Americans
[18:16:41] <teear> can you html kandinski
[18:17:00] <kandinski> html is not a verb
[18:17:04] <kandinski> and yes, I know html
[18:17:20] <teear> if you cant can you use a text editor on linux to get those spaces away
[18:17:20] <Zerxer> are you sure
[18:17:22] <Zerxer> I can html
[18:17:44] * ngharo htmls
[18:17:49] <teear> maybe VI text editor you dickelbÃ¤r
[18:18:00] <kandinski> right, now I am in the minority
[18:18:07] <ngharo> req: ban teear
[18:18:27] <kandinski> or not
[18:18:37] <kandinski> anyhow, thanks guys
[18:18:40] <teear> DickelbÃ¤r was a compliment you ngharo
[18:19:17] <Zerxer> teear was a problem the other day too
[18:26:02] <lisak> any idea why this doesn't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/SgLpF/14/
[18:26:15] <lisak> it suddenly stopped printing to the console 4 3 2 1
[18:26:31] <gnarf> lisak: errors?
[18:26:37] <myName_> Does anyone know why this doesn't work: var ths = $('th', v);   I get an empty array. v is my table element- there are definitely TH elements in the table.
[18:26:39] <lisak> nope
[18:26:42] <gnarf> var lenght = arr.lenght;
[18:26:49] <gnarf> you think spelling that wrong might be an issue?
[18:27:05] <lisak> omg :)
[18:27:11] <gnarf> lisak: btw, prototype extensions are lame
[18:27:12] <Zerxer> debuggers!
[18:27:18] <Zerxer> they point out syntax errors
[18:27:23] <lisak> jsfiddle sucks at debugging
[18:27:26] <gnarf> Zerxer: that wasn't syntax ;)
[18:27:32] <lisak> it doesn't do anything in ff nor chrome
[18:27:36] <Zerxer> well rather it should say the property doesn't exist
[18:27:42] <Zerxer> shouldn't it?
[18:27:42] <gnarf> totally legal statement, its just "undefined"
[18:27:49] <Zerxer> hm
[18:28:03] <gnarf> if "arr" was not an object you'd get an error
[18:28:05] <gnarf> but
[18:28:05] <lisak> damn copy & paste
[18:28:05] <gnarf> yeah
[18:28:08] * Zerxer floats off
[18:28:26] <gnarf> lisak: why not just use .pop() and .length ?
[18:28:40] <gnarf> if (arr.length) { console.log(arr.pop()) }
[18:29:16] <gnarf> even better... while( arr.length ) { console.log( arr.pop() ); }
[18:29:16] <gnarf> ?
[18:29:26] <lisak> uh, I didn't know about pop
[18:29:44] <gnarf> push / pop / shift / unshift

[18:30:18] <gnarf> lisak: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/SgLpF/15/
[18:30:27] <gnarf> and it doesn't add random properties to every array
[18:31:18] <lisak> omg is it possible that the documentation doesn't say what does it return when there is not further element
[18:31:54] <lisak> it's a speciality of javascript, jquery and yui documentation
[18:31:56] <gnarf> lisak: undefined?
[18:32:04] <gnarf> ?js var a = []; a.pop();
[18:32:05] <bot-t> gnarf: undefined
[18:32:06] <lisak> well you know that already

[18:32:17] <gnarf> omg
[18:32:56] <myName_> Bump: Does anyone know why this doesn't work: var ths = $('th', v);   I get an empty array. v is my table element- there are definitely TH elements in the table.
[18:33:06] <lisak> great it would took half a second if the doc was properly done :)

[18:33:46] <gnarf> lisak: add a comment to the doc then, so other people can benifit then?
[18:33:47] <lisak> you know
[18:34:01] <lisak> can I ?
[18:34:02] <Guest64925> hi in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/8/
[18:34:04] <gnarf> lisak: no, i don't --- javascript consoles exist for a reason
[18:34:09] <Guest64925> it is sayikng it posted sucessfully
[18:34:20] <Guest64925> but what I want to post is message
[18:34:51] <gnarf> lisak: the ability to test little things like that and see the edge cases happen for yourself is a great learning experience IMO
[18:35:01] <gnarf> i didn't know that undefined was the answer for sure
[18:35:10] <gnarf> but i just tested my theory
[18:35:19] <lisak> I don't want to argue about this ... if somebody writes an entire page about something, it really should be there
[18:35:21] <myName_> @pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/zDFBQ/1/
[18:36:25] <gnarf> lisak: an overlooked detail I'm sure...
[18:36:37] <pifantastic> myName_: Can you please make it a complete fiddle?  Add jQuery, html, etc..
[18:36:39] <myName_> err, ignoring the bad copy paste at the start 'myClass'
[18:36:43] <sdio> I've got a <td id="someid"></td> to which I'd like to add: "<b>Hi!</b>", for example. but, doing: $('td#someid').text('<b>Hi!</b>'); escapes the html. How would I set the text so the html isn't escaped? :)
[18:37:01] <pifantastic> ?html @ sdio
[18:37:02] <bot-t> sdio, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[18:37:11] <pifantastic> use html() instead of text()
[18:37:43] <coldhead> wat
[18:37:55] <sdio> huh, I was fairly certain I'd tried that.
[18:38:04] <sdio> Thanks again, pifantastic.
[18:38:26] <Guest64925> cold head
[18:39:22] <Guest64925> this is displaying sucessful but I want to post the message only  http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/8/
[18:43:19] <Guest64925> need help
[18:43:19] <Guest64925> here
[18:44:42] <Guest64925> hello
[18:44:53] <goldenwest> Guest64925 I don't understand what you're trying to accomplish
[18:45:21] <Guest64925> I want to insert the comment and display it right away without having to refresh the whole page
[18:46:07] <Guest64925> so far in the jsfiddle I gave you it will print 'post successful 'not the actual comment
[18:46:24] <goldenwest> Use an AJAX request
[18:46:26] <Guest64925> it will not print the comment form, the comment, the other older comments
[18:46:45] <Guest64925> can you please use the fiddle and show
[18:46:46] <Guest64925> please
[18:46:58] <Guest64925> http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/8/
[18:48:24] <goldenwest> Guest64925 can't really do it in a fiddle... you'll need to use PHP
[18:48:32] <goldenwest> read about ajax requests
[18:48:59] <Guest64925> basically
[18:49:44] <Guest64925> the ajax request would be workin in conjuction with existing javascript rith now and
[18:49:48] <Guest64925> ?
[18:50:00] <SpaceAceJase> hi
[18:50:09] <Guest64925> do I need another plugin for ajax requests
[18:50:10] <Guest64925> ?
[18:50:14] <goldenwest> no
[18:50:36] <goldenwest> ?ajax @Guest64925
[18:50:37] <bot-t> Guest64925, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:50:49] <Guest64925> thanks bot
[18:52:04] <Guest64925> for this form can you make a snipet example please
[18:52:07] <Guest64925> ?
[18:52:54] <Guest64925> it means I can target any specific tags with the ajax>?
[18:53:48] <goldenwest> ajax sends a request to a page... /path/to/file.php ... in the php file run whatever code you want and echo back what you want to return
[18:53:54] <goldenwest> then you can get the data
[18:54:06] <goldenwest> this way you can query your database or whatever without refreshing the page
[18:59:37] <Guest64925> I can even path to an expesific tag?
[19:00:10] <goldenwest> ?
[19:00:23] <goldenwest> you can apply the data to a specific tag
[19:00:44] <coldhead> Guest64925: http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/14/
[19:00:52] <coldhead> ?find @ Guest64925
[19:00:52] <bot-t> Guest64925, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:00:59] <coldhead> i think find() is what you need
[19:01:20] <coldhead> i have no idea why you don't just use ajaxform
[19:01:31] <coldhead> which Actually Works
[19:01:32] <kandinski> does it make sense to use head.js with jquery_
[19:01:38] <coldhead> but that's a matter for yourself
[19:01:44] <jimmyz221> I'm trying to change a select dropdowns selected value when the page loads using $("#Listbox option[value='cat']").attr("selected","selected");  This isn't working at all, can someone give me a hand?
[19:01:57] <kandinski> or does jquery have the head.js functionality_
[19:04:57] <coldhead> Guest64925: i hate you
[19:10:18] <bewilled> I'm trying to load a bing maps ajax control inside a jquery tab, it doesn't seem to work... any ideas?
[19:15:25] <bewilled> The map is located in a page called map.html, the page loads fine on its own, its only when I load it within a tab that it doesn't work
[19:22:50] <ProLoser|Mac> hello
[19:27:25] <sylon> hi does $('#div').html() strip out invalid stuff from it before returning it?
[19:29:19] <pifantastic> sylon: I believe it returns whatever is in the DOM, meaning, it can't be invalid in the first place
[19:30:01] <ryanseddon> sylon: internally it just returns the innerHTML of the element
[19:30:24] <pifantastic> ?source html
[19:30:24] <bot-t> Line#5194 - "html: function( value ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5194
[19:31:26] <ProLoser|Mac> any reason why .click() doesn't work for disabled inputs?
[19:31:45] <ryanseddon> It would most likely be the browser correcting malformed html when parsing it
[19:31:57] <pifantastic> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/jquery-1.5.1.js#L5194
[19:34:39] <bewilled> I'm trying to load a bing maps ajax control inside a jquery tab, it doesn't seem to work... any ideas?  The map is located in a page called map.html, the page loads fine on its own, its only when I load it within a tab that it doesn't work
[19:34:59] <ryanseddon> bewilled: do a jsfiddle so people can actually help you
[19:35:14] <bewilled> ryanseddon, how?
[19:35:22] <pifantastic> ?p @ bewilled
[19:35:22] <bot-t> bewilled, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/

[19:56:12] <reli> sorry about the off topic, but is there a way to check is a number is odd in php?   i been searching for a long time
[19:57:57] <tbranyen> reli: uh modulous
[19:58:00] <tbranyen> modulus?
[19:58:02] <tbranyen> however its speleld

[19:59:38] <reli> tbranyen: thanks
[19:59:38] <dibs> I have a div with text in it and a live('click') assigned to it. If I tap on the text in iOS browser it won't fire but if I click off the text it does. Anyone know a fix?
[20:06:34] <bewilled> Ok guys, I found the problem, It seems that when I invoque another page within a tab, and that page calles a function on the body onload, that function is not called
[20:07:10] <bewilled> can I replace body on load for something else?
[20:27:06] <research4oscar_> any suggestions for a light weight ide.  i like rapidphp on a windows but need one for my mac.
[20:27:59] <thomasd> I didnt understand a word you said you may be in the wrong channel
[20:29:26] <innociv> I can't find how to make a function that chains
[20:30:25] <tbranyen> innociv: uh function a() { return b; } function b(i) { console.log(i); } a().b(lol);
[20:30:30] <tbranyen> mebbe?
[20:30:47] <tbranyen> welp b('lol')
[20:30:59] <coldhead> retun this;
[20:31:03] <innociv> That's what I thought I'm doing.
[20:31:09] <coldhead> rrr
[20:31:11] <tbranyen> also a()('lol')
[20:31:12] <tbranyen> not b
[20:31:14] <tbranyen> since b isn't a property
[20:31:18] <tbranyen> you'd need to return an object
[20:31:21] <tbranyen> mapping a name to the method
[20:31:50] <innociv> function autocompleteTags(){ ... return this; }  $("#autocomplete").autocompleteTags(); says $("#autocomplete").autocompleteTags is not a function
[20:32:22] <tbranyen> return $(this)?
[20:32:59] <innociv> Still
[20:34:28] <shaan> hmmm....
[20:35:01] <shaan> how to declare a function n jquery
[20:35:15] <ryanseddon> $.fn.extend({fn:function(){}})
[20:35:32] <shaan> what is fn
[20:35:58] <shaan> a111???
[20:36:17] <shaan> pora
[20:36:55] <coldhead> $.fn.chickenhead = function () { alert('lol') };
[20:37:09] <coldhead> oops
[20:37:21] <coldhead> $.chickenhead = function () { alert('lol') };
[20:37:32] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/VzCnJ/9/ Here is a paste.  Says it isnt' define.  Maybe I need to declare the function like that?
[20:38:05] <ryanseddon> innociv: it's looking on the jQuery prototype for a function called autoCompleteTags which doesn't exist
[20:38:43] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/VzCnJ/13/ so it should be like this?
[20:40:33] <ryanseddon> yeah
[20:46:50] <PW-toXic> how can i ad a link around an element with ajax?  i tried using after() and before() but after and before only takes valid html or addes end tags automatically
[20:47:30] <ngharo> ?wrap
[20:47:30] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[20:56:35] <mackry>  Is it possible to do something like this? $('#el').css({ (adjust) ? 'right' : 'left' : (adjust) ? 0 : i.parent().position().left }); For an object property declaration?
[20:58:22] <Zerxer> mackry: no, better off doing it like .css(adjust ? {'right': whatever} : {'left': adjust? 'whatever':'whatever'})
[20:58:32] <Zerxer> the object property names can't be set like that
[20:58:55] <Zerxer> if you want to add other properties too, just make use of $.extend
[20:59:24] <Zerxer> or build the object beforehand, and then add one of the two propreties dynamically
[20:59:47] <mackry> What would be an example of the latter?
[21:00:30] <Zerxer> var obj = {}; if(adjust) obj['right'] = ''; else obj['left'] = '';
[21:00:35] <Zerxer> then .css(obj)
[21:00:48] <Zerxer> and you can add your other properties in when defining obj, if it has any others
[21:01:43] <mackry> yeah, there's a few others. not following obj['right'] thought. wouldn't it be obj.right?
[21:03:30] <Zerxer> mackry: either way works. json objects can be used similar to how you'd use a PHP associative array. with named indexes
[21:03:46] <Zerxer> I always do it ['this'] way when defining a property that doesn't exist yet
[21:04:08] <Zerxer> I don't know why
[21:09:28] <mackry> Zerxer: Works great, thanks mate!
[21:12:50] <cdtank> I have cached select.element like so, var elem = $("select#id").. now I need to get the selected option using just "elem"
[21:12:54] <cdtank> how to go about it?
[21:13:14] <Zerxer> elem.find('option:selected')
[21:13:36] <Zerxer> you really don't need the select part in front of that selector. IDs are unique already, or should be, so "#id" should be all you need
[21:13:57] <cdtank> Zerxer: k. thanks!
[21:17:03] <ccarpenterg> what's the best tool to minify a js file?

[21:21:08] <ccarpenterg> thanks, i'm going to try it
[21:21:35] <gkatsev> heh, isaacs is now above the official one on google?
[21:21:58] <gkatsev> or not. I wonder why it chose isaacs's fork
[21:22:38] <coldhead> gkatsev: i think bot-t gets personalisted results and prefers stuff that mentions jQuery
[21:22:50] <coldhead> and maybe that guy has forked jQuery
[21:23:13] <coldhead> personalised*
[21:23:30] <coldhead> TAKE TWO STEPS TOWARDS TEXAS TONIGHT
[21:24:12] <gkatsev> nope, he hasn't forked jquery. He does lots of node stuff. Wrote npm.
[21:25:06] <coldhead> well maybe he has "jQuery" in a commit mesage or something
[21:25:14] <gkatsev> maybe
[21:25:23] <coldhead> don't patronise me
[21:25:28] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[21:25:33] <gkatsev> lol
[21:27:03] <futini> if i have :var id = $(this).attr("id"); how do this : var comment  = $( ID + "textarea").val(); dont workking

[21:27:17] <futini> please help :)
[21:27:23] <caolanm> anyone know how to stop jQuery from sending */* for the Accept header on ajax requests?
[21:27:41] <caolanm> I want it to accept ONLY "application/json" for one request
[21:27:57] <coldhead> $('#' + id + ' textarea')
[21:28:06] <caolanm> looking at the source code it doesn't look possible, the addition of */* is hard-coded
[21:28:23] <coldhead> futini: but try this instead: var elem = this; var comment = $('textarea', elem);
[21:29:17] <futini> thankss!!
[21:29:18] <futini> :D
[21:29:36] <futini> i will try coldhead thanks :)
[21:30:17] <coldhead> caolanm: maybe you can set it with the pre-flight stuff people use that i don't really understand?
[21:31:01] <caolanm> I've tried some beforeSend and ajaxSetup stuff with no luck
[21:31:14] <caolanm> unless you have something specific you think I should try?
[21:31:25] <coldhead> you know more than me, so i won't try to help more :)
[21:31:46] <coldhead> danheberden or ajpiano? you guys know ajax right?
[21:33:41] <dr0id> no
[21:35:41] <coldhead> ?source one
[21:35:42] <bot-t> Line#1908 - "one = elem.type === "select-one";" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1908
[21:35:50] <coldhead> NO NO NO NO NO
[21:35:58] <futini> very thankyou coldhead its works!

[21:59:20] <coldhead> i just don't think you understnad the code you have
[22:00:13] <dytrivedi> have you heard of bubbling?
[22:00:28] <coldhead> me?
[22:00:30] <coldhead> i haven't
[22:00:36] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[22:00:37] <jquery1234> Yes, I'm just not sure how to 'trap' the first click and wait and see if another click is going to follow
[22:01:00] <jquery1234> Oh, dytrivedi, not sure who you were replying to :p
[22:01:15] <coldhead> he wasn't very clear huh
[22:02:47] <dytrivedi> jquery1234: use setTimeout
[22:02:48] <dytrivedi> man
[22:03:38] <jquery1234> dytrivedi: Doh, why didn't I think of that :p Thanks!
[22:07:49] <Guest90293> blabling hahaha that thatthat is talkin
[22:08:12] <Guest90293> well like you say almost there the magic is coming
[22:09:55] <Guest90293> it is displaying a blank comment then after I refresh then the comment will appear, i was thinking of the function show();
[22:27:06] <Guest90293> to emmbed php through jquery how is that possible?
[22:27:26] <Wulf> embedded php? wtf?
[22:27:33] <Guest90293> lol
[22:27:35] <Guest90293> $the_message = $row["message"];
[22:27:38] <Wulf> Guest90293: javascript and jquery run on the client, php on the server.
[22:27:53] <Guest90293> meaning in the computer
[22:27:56] <Guest90293> client?
[22:28:15] <Wulf> your webbrowser
[22:28:23] <Guest90293> ok
[22:28:44] <Guest90293> how can I translate a server variable $the_message = $row["message"]; and make display its content throught jquery
[22:28:50] <Guest90293> ?
[22:30:05] <Wulf> make an ajax request with jquery; your php program prints the message.
[22:30:56] <coldhead> Guest90293: http://au.php.net/json_encode
[22:31:20] <anisa> can any one help me in jqGrid?
[22:31:27] <Guest90293> so far the jquery I have it's printing the html targeting the var comment = $(html) . find('#message').html();
[22:31:55] <coldhead> ?w json @ Guest90293
[22:31:56] <bot-t> Guest90293, JSON - JSON (an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation ) is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
[22:31:58] <Guest90293> i just need to print the content of the message variable
[22:32:15] <Guest90293> I will go for json guys
[22:32:18] <Guest90293> let me check that
[22:33:09] <coldhead> Guest90293: if find('#message').text() or .html() don't  work you sshould learn and use JSON
[22:33:46] <blkcat> probably a dumb question here, but how can i submit a form using the enter key when the submit button is hidden?
[22:33:57] <anisa> can any body help me in jqgrid?
[22:34:38] <Wulf> blkcat: what good is a hidden submit button? iirc, you don't need a submit button at all
[22:35:10] <blkcat> Wulf: so i thought, but i can't seem to get this thing to submit without a button that's both a) present and b) visible
[22:35:28] <coldhead> blkcat: test for ENTER using .keypress(), submit with submit()
[22:35:31] <coldhead> ?keypress
[22:35:32] <bot-t> .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[22:35:36] <coldhead> ?submit
[22:35:36] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[22:35:53] <Guest90293> cold hed non of the two functions workd .text() or html()
[22:36:05] <Guest90293> I will go for jason let me see that term
[22:36:09] <coldhead> Guest90293: you must learn json. good luck
[22:37:51] <TomWork> hey guys, any ideas how can I make this example draggable only through the title so I can still select the text inside the portlet ? : http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets
[22:39:13] <ryanseddon> TomWork: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#handle
[22:39:49] <ryanseddon> That shows you how to make an element draggable only by specific element
[22:42:10] <TomWork> ryanseddon: ta
[22:42:14] <TomWork> I must be blind
[22:48:08] <Guest90293> $json = $row["message"]; $the_message = json_encode($json); I have json encoded and it will get all the messages or posts inside quotes "" but still the newest post won't show up no even the empty quotes display
[22:48:33] <lijzz> guest
[22:48:41] <lijzz> 1 small doubt about jquery 1.6

[23:00:11] <coldhead> the raw JSON data that the other stuff you keeep linking is going to operate on
[23:00:12] <Guest90293> ok

[23:00:29] <Guest90293> the data after submiting the form is
[23:00:31] <coldhead> if i don't kill myself first
[23:00:37] <Guest90293> it is nothing

[23:02:34] <Guest90293> "the it is interesting" is the comment
[23:02:48] <lijzz> ok i understand now
[23:02:49] <Guest90293> and the quotes arount it is the json effect
[23:02:52] <lijzz> sorry for that
[23:03:03] <coldhead> no problem!
[23:03:13] <coldhead> Guest90293: this is not JSON
[23:03:21] <coldhead> ?jsonlint @ Guest90293
[23:03:22] <bot-t> Guest90293, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[23:03:29] <Guest90293> when you say JSON you mean in the javascript part?
[23:03:45] <lijzz> coldhead this is the link
[23:03:47] <lijzz> http://fixee.org/paste/1wyzrd2/
[23:04:03] <coldhead> no, Guest90293. you are using a PHP function -- json_encode() to CREATE some json so that you can pass it to the jQuery and the jQuery can understand it
[23:04:55] <Guest90293> So I have to use the json_encode() function in order to pass it to the jquery
[23:05:02] <Guest90293> or not I have to not use th function ?
[23:05:25] <coldhead> you have to use it
[23:06:03] <lijzz> coldhead u got the link?
[23:06:27] <Guest90293> I am using it in the message database field
[23:06:57] <coldhead> Guest90293: try to print your message from php in JSON format, by using json_encode. paste it into jsonlint until it says "valid JSON"
[23:06:57] <Guest90293> like $message = json_encode($json);
[23:07:02] <coldhead> then i can help you more
[23:07:16] <coldhead> lijzz: i am looking now
[23:07:35] <Guest90293> so I just hav eto pay theyou mean like $message = json_encode($json);
[23:07:58] <Guest90293> print "$message";
[23:08:01] <coldhead> yes then <?= $message ?>
[23:08:04] <Guest90293> and then paste the result ?
[23:08:07] <coldhead> yes!
[23:08:09] <coldhead> exactly :)
[23:08:19] <Guest90293> in the validator hahah I am going there
[23:10:36] <coldhead> lijzz: this is a lot of code!
[23:10:41] <lijzz> hh
[23:10:57] <lijzz> its just an ajax request
[23:11:10] <coldhead> it even has eval()!
[23:11:31] <lijzz> the other function addToCheckBoxListList is just making a checkbox list
[23:12:06] <coldhead> you also use a lot of getElementById which i have heard of but i've never actually used it
[23:12:57] <lijzz> i could have used the find$ way
[23:13:04] <coldhead> wait there are 2 ajax calls in here?
[23:13:06] <lijzz> both yields same result
[23:13:07] <coldhead> i'm getting confused
[23:14:01] <coldhead> there is so little jquery in here
[23:14:05] <lijzz> cold head both functions GetStateByCountryand getmetros() is just the same
[23:14:12] <coldhead> lijzz: what doesn't work about this now?
[23:14:27] <lijzz> the get metros is not working
[23:14:31] <coldhead> when you try to make multiple requests, what do you expect to happen and what does happen?
[23:14:47] <lijzz> it should happen at the same time
[23:14:55] <Guest90293> Parse error on line 1:
[23:15:02] <Guest90293> coldhead parse error
[23:15:08] <lijzz> for eg: if select a country, it should fetch states as well as metros
[23:15:17] <Guest90293> <ul class="class">
[23:15:34] <Guest90293> Expecting '{', '['
[23:16:36] <[M]Brock> anyone on
[23:16:36] <[M]Brock> ?
[23:17:53] <coldhead> Guest90293: so it is expecting { and [ because that's what JSON requires. you need to make sure the PHP json_encode is inserting those
[23:18:04] <coldhead> it should do it automatically, try to fix it
[23:18:42] <[M]Brock> Whenever i try to use Jquery menus downloaded separately wid ui-darkness .. it fails
[23:18:43] <[M]Brock> why
[23:18:44] <[M]Brock> ?
[23:18:57] <Guest90293> coldhead where the { or [ goes here?
[23:18:59] <Guest90293>    $json = $row["message"];
[23:19:12] <[M]Brock> i mean if d Menus scripts are added then The Jquery theme doesn't work
[23:19:27] <coldhead> lijzz: this is even more complicated than i thought. i don't know if the code you have will work how you want. i can think of a way it could be done but it would mean a rewrite
[23:19:33] <Guest90293> $message_date = $row["message_date"];
[23:19:43] <Guest90293> $message = json_encode($json);
[23:19:57] <lijzz> what is that
[23:19:59] <Guest90293> just in this variables ?>
[23:20:00] <coldhead> lijzz: you probably need to do a MVC kind of thing in the browser
[23:20:08] <RWOverdijk> I'm having some problems with jqueryui. I think that my code (using jqueryui) gets executed before jqueryui is done downloading. Like there is with jquery, *$(function(){});* is there an init method for jqueryui, so I can be sure it has loaded?
[23:20:13] <coldhead> at least a crude one
[23:21:19] <coldhead> Guest90293: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example
[23:21:44] <coldhead> try pasting that example into jsonhint, Guest90293, and try to make yours look like that
[23:21:55] <Guest90293> ok
[23:21:56] <coldhead> ?nopm @ [M]Brock
[23:21:56] <bot-t> [M]Brock, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[23:21:58] <Guest90293> let me see how is that
[23:23:32] <coldhead> [M]Brock: what is the link where you download from?
[23:23:43] <[M]Brock> http://www.apycom.com
[23:25:10] <coldhead> i have no idea what this is, [M]Brock
[23:25:23] <RWOverdijk> I've tried $.ui(), I dont know why, but that doesn't work either.
[23:25:26] <[M]Brock> jquery menu downloads
[23:25:27] <[M]Brock> ..
[23:25:32] <coldhead> it looks like you have to pay for it? maybe pay them to help fix it
[23:26:13] <[M]Brock> okay
[23:26:14] <[M]Brock> ..
[23:26:55] <[M]Brock> btw is thr any place for Jquery menu download?
[23:27:00] <[M]Brock> from whr u guyz do
[23:27:04] <[M]Brock> .. Someting free
[23:27:25] <RWOverdijk> [M]Brock,
[23:27:31] <[M]Brock> yah
[23:27:34] <coldhead> [M]Brock: http://jqueryui.com/ there should be free menu stuff there
[23:27:36] <RWOverdijk> http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/
[23:27:52] <RWOverdijk> sorry, copy paste went wrong. :p
[23:27:59] <[M]Brock> oO
[23:28:03] <[M]Brock> ..k
[23:28:18] <RWOverdijk> [M]Brock, You wanted a menu right? That's one of the nicest menu's I know.
[23:28:26] <[M]Brock> okay
[23:28:36] <RWOverdijk> It's customizable, and uses hoverIntent (as should any js based menu)
[23:29:20] <[M]Brock> okay Thanks
[23:29:32] <RWOverdijk> I'm still hoping someone knows how to execute code on init (jqueryui)
[23:29:56] <RWOverdijk> :p I cant be the first person having this problem, right?
[23:32:10] <Guest90293> I don't understand the concept coldhead here
[23:32:19] <Guest90293> why wrap it in the curly braces and where
[23:32:38] <Guest90293> it is just hee json_encode variable to be inside curly braces?
[23:32:58] <RWOverdijk> Guest71803, What are you trying to do?
[23:33:04] <RWOverdijk> I didnt catch your initial question
[23:33:06] <Guest90293> so it can display the message data
[23:33:20] <Guest90293> I am trying to post a comment
[23:33:31] <RWOverdijk> Are you trying to figure out how json works?
[23:33:42] <Guest90293> which I am using http://paste.pocoo.org/show/393492/
[23:33:46] <Guest90293> yes
[23:34:08] <Guest90293> this is displaying the tags #pmessage but then the actual message or comemnt is not coming up
[23:34:10] <Guest90293> I don't know hwy
[23:34:16] <RWOverdijk> Guest71803, I usually use ajax, with dataType set to json, so it already encodes and decodes
[23:34:17] <Guest90293> the jquery is working
[23:34:43] <RWOverdijk> Right
[23:34:45] <Guest90293> how would you ajax that request on click to messageinput
[23:34:50] <Guest90293> do you have an example please
[23:35:03] <Guest90293> I want to display that comment
[23:35:22] <Guest90293> it is displaying after browser refresh
[23:35:48] <Guest90293> how would you build an ajax request ontop of this jquery i just sent you
[23:35:57] <Guest90293> which is working but not displaying the message itself
[23:36:18] <RWOverdijk> Guest90293, Look, I'm not going to hold your hand through this entire thing.
[23:36:28] <RWOverdijk> I'll give you some pointers, and you'll google the rest yourself
[23:36:46] <Guest90293> yes give me really specific pointers
[23:37:04] <Guest90293> I can keep trying to figure this out but be as specific as you can
[23:37:23] <RWOverdijk> First off, json is a way of standardizing data, so you can use it in php and js. So when transmitting the data, you'll want it to be json encoded.
[23:37:26] <Guest90293> part from this quote in this thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6092453/having-issues-with-a-form-trying-to-use-jquery-to-ajax-only-the-the-message-fiel/6092487#6092487
[23:37:58] <Guest90293> why do I want it json encoded?
[23:38:16] <RWOverdijk> Because otherwise you cant send data between php and js
[23:38:23] <RWOverdijk> it'll produce errors.
[23:38:41] <Guest90293> ooooooooooo
[23:38:59] <Guest90293> the error here is not displaying the message even though it is actually doing the event
[23:39:09] <RWOverdijk> for php a simple json_encode() will do for sending out data. for reading data you've received from js (an xmlhttprequest) you can use json_decode().
[23:39:19] <Guest90293> it display the tags withou browser refresh but mr comment won;t return
[23:39:34] <RWOverdijk> yeah... good luck
[23:39:35] <RWOverdijk> I'm out
[23:40:15] <Guest90293> reading the data mean displaying? it
[23:40:22] <Guest90293> uhhh RW?
[23:41:22] <Guest90293> having a form like I do
[23:41:32] <Guest90293> and pressing submit
[23:41:45] <Guest90293> converts ythe data in js>
[23:41:55] <Guest90293> then I have to decode to read back again in php
[23:41:57] <Guest90293> ?
[23:42:35] <Guest90293> or by the time I submit the form and the data goes in it still php data type or once submited it becomes js
[23:42:36] <Guest90293> ?
[23:42:48] <Guest90293> submit js?
[23:42:56] <Guest90293> then I have to decode back to php?>
[23:43:00] <Guest90293> to display it ?
[23:44:47] <Guest90293> every body is sleeping here?
[23:45:38] <gnarf> no, but tbh i haven't read anything you posted other than that last line
[23:46:42] <Guest90293> ok
[23:46:59] <Guest90293> once you submit a comment through a form with jquery
[23:47:19] <Guest90293> what happen to actual text you input to the database throught the textarea field
[23:47:33] <Guest90293> does it become js data or it still php data?
[23:47:40] <gnarf> thats a really good question, and whoever writes that code could probably tell you
[23:47:53] <gnarf> if you're the one writing it, it does whatever you fn tell it to
[23:48:14] <gnarf> there is no such thing really as "js data" or "php data"
[23:48:15] <gnarf> btw
[23:48:22] <Guest90293> well so far someone wrote it and I looking for the dynamics
[23:48:38] <Guest90293> well I know I am looking for the proper terminology
[23:48:46] <gnarf> okay
[23:48:47] <Guest90293> and actual dynamics of the script
[23:48:58] <gnarf> dynamics is a bad word
[23:49:06] <Guest90293> functionality
[23:49:09] <gnarf> better
[23:49:19] <gnarf> have you tried reading the code?
[23:49:27] <gnarf> looking up functions?
[23:49:28] <Guest90293> the steps taken by the cursors
[23:49:36] <gnarf> what cursors?
[23:49:38] <Guest90293> no functinos
[23:49:43] <gnarf> documentation
[23:49:46] <gnarf> read it
[23:49:53] <gnarf> you remember the old saying RTFM?
[23:50:02] <Guest90293> trfm what>?

[23:50:15] <Guest90293> man
[23:50:20] <bot-t> gnarf, RTFM - Read The Fucking Manual
[23:50:25] <Guest90293> hahaha
[23:50:42] <gnarf> so
[23:50:51] <gnarf> we are here to try and provide support for jquery issues
[23:51:16] <gnarf> not neccesarily school someone in the ways of manipulating data between javascript, php, databases, and other funness
[23:51:33] <gnarf> we like helping people though
[23:51:41] <gnarf> and if you had a jquery question, we would probably answer it
[23:52:15] <gnarf> and if you keep asking unrelated questions, eventually one of the 772 other people here might answer
[23:52:35] <gnarf> but most likely, you'd have better luck a) reading books on the topic
[23:52:53] <gnarf> b) the manual pages ... http://php.net / http://api.jquery.com etc
