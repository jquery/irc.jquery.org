[00:05:17] <carlo5m> I am using the submit function to catch a form but when the button is clicked I want to maniputate html. Do I I have to use click?
[00:05:40] <carlo5m> I want to use the this inside submit but it returns a jquery object with no htnml
[00:06:58] <grafi> so you want to manipulate the button?
[00:17:53] <carlo5m> yes then traverse to the tr
[00:24:55] <Eviltwin> ?closest @ carlo5m
[00:24:55] <bot-t> carlo5m, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:25:49] <carlo5m> $('.delete').submit(function () {
[00:25:49] <carlo5m> 		
[00:25:49] <carlo5m> 		$(this).remove();
[00:25:58] <carlo5m> and it doesnt change anything

[00:26:15] <Eviltwin> Please create a demo of your problem at jsFiddle.net
[00:27:36] <1JTAAAQAD> please post it on jSfiDDLe.nEt
[00:29:00] <carlo5m> ok
[00:29:57] <carlo5m> http://jsfiddle.net/aFEmv/
[00:30:42] <carlo5m> http://jsfiddle.net/aFEmv/1/
[00:32:07] <carlo5m> Updated the html
[00:32:08] <carlo5m> http://jsfiddle.net/aFEmv/2/
[00:33:08] <grafi> so the form is there just to be able to remove the row?
[00:33:20] <carlo5m> yes
[00:33:56] <carlo5m> it's tied down with php and will to ajax call to remove the row in db
[00:34:04] <carlo5m> but want to get javascript down
[00:34:27] <grafi> ah, ok
[00:36:49] <carlo5m> @Eviltwin @1JTAAAQAD @b-ot any luck?
[00:37:30] <carlo5m> http://jsfiddle.net/aFEmv/2/
[00:37:38] <ph88> carlo5m:  it works now ?
[00:38:12] <grafi> it does if you include jquery in the fiddle :P
[00:38:29] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/aFEmv/3/
[00:38:57] <ph88> i just put preventdefault there for the demo ... take it out in production
[00:40:04] <carlo5m> hmmm let me revisit my code
[00:40:57] <carlo5m> thanks!
[00:47:54] <tdignan> Can I override the default behavior of a checkbox so that when it is clicked, it does not automatically check itself?
[00:48:15] <tdignan> I googled a lot last night but I did not find anything that worked. Of course, I have tried overriding change and click and returning false, using event.preventDefault() and so on.
[00:48:28] <tdignan> but it seems that the check mark always appears if clicking it.
[00:50:17] <EdwardIII> tdignan: are oyu looking for disabled?
[00:50:20] <ph88> tdignan: then just remove it again :P  or put it on disabled
[00:50:29] <EdwardIII> <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" />
[00:50:35] <tdignan> I am using disabled effectively to prevent the toggle *back*
[00:50:57] <tdignan> basically I want to withhold changing the checked state until some logic determines it.
[00:51:10] <EdwardIII> so keep it disabled until then
[00:51:31] <tdignan> yes, that works for the latter, the problem i'm asking about is: keeping the checkbox from lighting up in the first place.
[00:51:38] <tdignan> I can turn it back off but that might cause a flicker?
[00:52:26] <tdignan> I am toggling it off like you said with .prop
[00:52:29] <tdignan> and I don't see a flicker
[00:52:33] <tdignan> so I think i'm good!
[00:52:35] <tdignan> thanks for the help
[00:55:24] <EdwardIII> awesome
[00:56:35] <ph88> np
[01:27:39] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with callback priority. how can i set which callback from theese: $(document).click(function(){ //callback 1} ), $(document).click(function(){ //callback 2} ), $(document).click(function(){ //callback 3} ), will be triggered first, second and third?
[01:28:23] <Eviltwin> Handlers attached to a specific element for a specific event are fired in the order in which they are attached
[01:32:20] <MrS1lentcz> Eviltwin: i am making an information system with many, many events (click, keydown) for easiest handling and i have  the same many events in more javascript libraries for better readability... what can i to do?
[01:32:48] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you either have to add them in the order they need to be triggered
[01:33:00] <Cork> or you can't use separate event handlers
[01:33:21] <Cork> you could have a callback system where you can order the callbacks for example
[01:38:44] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: for example i have global "html blocks register" with ids of block, what can be active. and for ever active block i have a set with special events... in this register i have $(document).click() callback, which set active block, but i mean, its possible that other callback  from "special family" can be triggered early than this and it would be fatal...
[01:39:42] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: the chain order that was mentioned is only true when the event listener is on the same element
[01:39:54] <Cork> if you register on document, it will always trigger last
[01:40:15] <Cork> as the event has to bubble up from the real element to the document to trigger the event handler
[01:40:48] <MrS1lentcz> mmm
[01:42:53] <MrS1lentcz> so i mean, i can have some callback register, which will run set functions order by event.target and choosen priority from $(document).click() event...
[01:43:34] <Cork> no not from the event list
[01:43:50] <Cork> but you could build a list of functions to call and then call them in a loop
[01:44:02] <Cork> basically generate your own even system
[01:44:44] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: just i thought this, sorry for my english :)
[01:50:45] <jnhghy> need help, I have an issue with a short script, it should trigger an alert when the user clicks on a div but the div doesn't appear (seems the script doesn't work), if I replace the div id with document, then the alert is displayed, if I change the .click trigger with .ready, again the alert works, but with first code it deosn't, I have a paste bin also: http://pastebin.com/mkhLgCW6
[01:51:55] <Eviltwin> jnhghy: Please read this page: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:53:37] <jnhghy> Eviltwin: I'm not sure that's the info I need, when the code is using .ready, it works, the issue is when I switch .read with .click
[01:54:06] <Eviltwin> You don't have a .ready in your code that doesn't work
[01:54:15] <Eviltwin> ...or in the one that does for that matter
[01:55:00] <Cork> jnhghy: the point is that ready isn't a replacement for click
[01:55:09] <Cork> jnhghy: it should wrap your click binding call
[01:55:27] <jnhghy> so I need document.ready and inside it div.click?
[01:55:34] <Eviltwin> ...
[01:55:40] <Eviltwin> No, the other way around
[01:57:18] <Cork> Eviltwin: uh, no that was the correct way
[01:57:22] <jnhghy> Now is working, thanks Cork and Eviltwin
[01:57:31] <airdem> i want to change css properties of the dragged element in jquery-ui-dragable. how do i do this?
[01:57:40] <Eviltwin> Oh, I mistread what he said
[01:57:51] <Eviltwin> I overlooked the "it"
[01:58:17] <Cork> airdem: just style it in your css file if that is what you mean
[01:59:19] <airdem> Cork, was trying to do it like this but it has no effect https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2498e8f4f923787efb2c
[01:59:57] <Cork> airdem: in the css file
[02:00:01] <Cork> not in the script
[02:00:09] <airdem> but i want to do it in the script :)
[02:00:35] <airdem> btw im using sortable not dragable
[02:01:09] <Cork> airdem: you should not do styles in the script, unless you need to for animations
[02:01:19] <Cork> css is there for styling, and it is where it should be
[02:01:52] <airdem> i understand but for this case i would like to do it that way
[02:02:04] <airdem> sorry if it makes no sense
[02:02:22] <Cork> your creating a maintenance nightmare
[02:02:33] <Cork> *you're
[02:03:01] <airdem> i can live with that :)
[02:03:28] <Cork> problem is it prob isn't you who is going to have to live with it...
[02:05:14] <airdem> its only me maintaining the code
[02:05:18] <Cork> .ui-sortable-helper { background-color: black; }
[02:05:54] <Cork> if you want to have your css in your script do $('.ui-sortable-helper').css('background-color', 'black');
[02:06:20] <Cork> but i sinisterly recommend NOT doing it that way
[02:07:33] <airdem> its not working
[02:07:44] <Cork> well you will have to run it on drag start
[02:07:44] <airdem> added your css line to my stylesheet
[02:07:49] <Cork> and then remove it on drag stop
[02:08:09] <airdem> is there no way to get $(this) and set the bgcolor only for the actual helper?
[02:08:22] <airdem> i thought ui.helper.css('background-color', '#000'); would do
[02:08:48] <airdem> s/actual/current
[02:09:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/kLLmJ/
[02:11:34] <airdem> Cork, thanks for helping
[02:12:09] <airdem> btw how do i find out the css classes for all those elements?
[02:12:49] <Cork> by inspecting the page?
[02:22:03] <airdem> Cork, yeah but sometimes its not that easy. the drag helper for instance. it gets lost after clicking somewhere else :)
[02:22:20] <Cork> airdem: well the inspector should live update
[02:39:16] <webchao> good day, i am reading the documention on api.jquery.org, specifically http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ . is there a way, from that api documention, to jump directly to the jquery source code to inspect its implementation?
[02:40:08] <webchao> if not, what is your preferred way to browse the jquery source?
[02:53:23] <kumml> I have a simple fadein on a div when a href is clicked. However it instantly disappear after fadeIn, what could cause this?
[02:55:38] <amitprakash> Hi, is this code valid? $(parent_node).on('change', function(event) {update_values(parent_node);});
[02:56:18] <amitprakash> i.e. given that parent_node is a select button, will changes to value selected in select button trigger the function update_values?
[02:59:21] <Cork> amitprakash: yes, though it will trigger a bit delayed in some cases
[02:59:50] <Cork> kumml: impossible to say without seeing it
[03:00:21] <kumml> Cork let me grab it for you
[03:00:36] <amitprakash> Cork, let me try to put the script on jsfiddle.. for some reason, its not triggerring
[03:02:43] <kumml> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/cCSRg/
[03:03:14] <kumml> forgot to finish the ul in the fiddle
[03:03:17] <kumml> for your notice
[03:04:37] <Cork> kumml: http://jsfiddle.net/cCSRg/1/
[03:04:56] <Cork> kumml: the link will reload the page
[03:05:19] <kumml> aah, true
[03:05:20] <Cork> kumml: also if you don't plan to provide a real link, don't use link tags
[03:14:16] <amitprakash> Cork, Please take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/W6KM4/
[03:16:25] <amitprakash> Changing package type does not trigger the appropriate function..update_visibility ( line 22 ) when the bind is done at line 92
[03:16:57] <Cork> amitprakash: ugg...
[03:17:08] <Cork> amitprakash: you should have a look on delegated event listeners
[03:17:22] <Cork> your code is WAY overcomplicated, and is quite hard to follow...
[03:17:44] <t7> i have a group of elements i got from .children(), how can i access them by integer index?
[03:18:07] <Cork> ?.eq @ t7
[03:18:08] <bot-t1> t7, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:26:57] <amitprakash> Cork, isn't on recommended over delegate?
[03:27:36] <Cork> amitprakash: delegate is a way to bind events, and on is a combination function that has syntax for both bind and delegate
[03:27:48] <iaj> How would I use jquery to set the z-index of .foo to some value?
[03:27:49] <amitprakash> ah
[03:28:09] <Cork> iaj: you select the element with the class and set it
[03:29:36] <iaj> Is there an easy way to toggle between 2 values??  Like from 9999 to 0 and vice versa?
[03:29:53] <Cork> use a class
[03:30:07] <Cork> $('.foo').toggleClass('bar')
[03:30:24] <amitprakash> Cork, another thing.. my parent_node here isn't created on the fly.. so why do I need to worry about future elements? If I am worried about only selectors matching now, isn't the bind syntax sufficient?
[03:30:44] <mrHAT> i'm still struggling with the issue described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17590350/typeerror-xhrreq-abort-is-not-a-function  and posted here in this channel as well yesterday wtf is going on..
[03:30:54] <amitprakash> Cork, as for the excess complication.. the js works in tandem with a django widget.. hence it requires this stupid parse structure
[03:30:55] <Cork> amitprakash: the point was not about future, but about simplifying the code
[03:31:29] <amitprakash> I'll try to think of a simpler way then
[03:31:44] <Cork> amitprakash: the code is a knot of arrays objects and loops it's close to impossible to follow what it's meant to do
[03:32:14] <amitprakash> Cork, irrespective of it, cant one simply inspect whats being bound at the required line numbers?
[03:32:49] <Cork> amitprakash: for me to be able to help you with the problem i need to understand what your trying to do
[03:33:05] <Cork> and the way the code is written makes that very hard
[03:33:10] <amitprakash> okay
[03:34:38] <Cork> the part i can follow tells me that you are over-complicating things, but exactly what your trying to do is more then i can figure out without dissecting the code
[03:35:44] <amitprakash> Cork, fair enough, again I'll try to think of a simpler way ( currently I don't see one) but I think I was able to resolve the issue
[03:41:10] <anew> http://pastebin.com/KR4kVvEf anyone have any idea why if i put line 8 outside the </script> tag line 13-15 work... but inside the script tag it doesnt
[03:41:16] <anew> cork maybe u know lol
[03:44:03] <j3lte> anew: might have to do with the << inside the <a>
[03:44:18] <anew> hmmm let me remove that
[03:44:24] <j3lte> try to replace those with &lt;&lt;
[03:44:45] <anew> no still didnt work tho
[03:44:56] <j3lte> and you need a space before id
[03:45:25] <anew> wut, no u dont
[03:45:40] <anew> it works if i place that line outside the </script> tag
[03:46:20] <j3lte> so what part of that line isn't working?
[03:46:32] <j3lte> maybe the <%=items[1].country%> part?
[03:46:49] <anew> let me replace that with something
[03:47:18] <anew> bleh no...dont know why the js doesnt fire inside there
[03:47:50] <anew> maybe i have to put the actual js code inside the <script> tag also?
[03:47:52] <anew> let me try that
[03:48:38] <j3lte> Ok, replace the $('#back-select-countries').click(function (e) {  --> with --> $(body).on('click','#back-select-countries',function(e) {
[03:49:09] <j3lte> well the js code should be in a script, obviously ;-)
[03:49:35] <j3lte> otherwise... I'm at a loss ;-)
[03:52:42] <anew> j4lte i have the js code on the top of the page
[03:52:49] <anew> this template loads in a popup
[03:52:57] <anew> so maybe the popup is not even reading the js code i dunno
[03:52:59] <anew> let me try it
[03:54:51] <anew> actually that wont work either
[03:54:54] <anew> bleh

[04:24:52] <bastetmilo> Hi. Anyone know script that crop images (not even crop, but select area to crop) and will work on mobile/touch devices?
[04:28:56] <motaka2> I used cache:true in jquery ajax and I dont know if it has any effect or not
[04:29:09] <titii> I have a little problem in webkit browser. I have a top header with menu and header wrap overflow hidden, in that header i have some popups with loginbox, search.. The menu is responsible, so some elements in the menu should be clipped by that overflow: hidden. The problem is, the bug. When I click on some inpt field of the search, or login, he jumped me down of the element with a overflow,...
[04:29:10] <titii> ...so I see the bottom, and that is wrong. Any idea how to hold top position of the element with overflow? Maybe with CSS, or event  like $('input').on('click' ... but  focus too. what is the name of focus event?
[04:32:57] <titii> OR: How can I Lock the element with owerflow hidden, to not moving arround? Just hold top position. How?
[04:33:14] <titii> with no scrolls effect
[04:37:42] <Cork> titii: position: fixed?
[04:39:04] <titii> Cork: but i dont wont to hold element position, but element's inner possition, that can scrolldown, because oferflow:hidden. I dont want to get him never to scrolldown
[04:39:14] <titii> the content
[04:39:16] <titii> u know<
[04:39:35] <Cork> so you wan to have it overflow, but without scrollbars?
[04:40:02] <Cork> hmm, well with overflow you will always have the scroll offset
[04:40:15] <Cork> an alternative is to absolute position the child elements
[04:41:31] <webchao> good day, what is your preferred way of reading the jquery source?
[04:41:35] <titii> cork, no, he is hidden, without scrollbars, but webkit has a bug in some moments, he scrolls down the content of that element in a bottom. Dont know his reason. U know? I want to protect it somehow to hold top position, like $('#top-menu-overflow').scrollTop(0);
[04:42:03] <Cork> titii: overflow: hidden, can still scroll, that isn't a bug
[04:42:06] <Cork> it just how it works
[04:42:29] <Cork> and if the scroll position is stored for some reason, the element will scroll later on
[04:42:30] <motaka2> Cork: What is the use of cache:true ? I dont see anychanges, what does it cache?
[04:42:37] <titii> Cork: ok, but i would see ever his top position :)
[04:42:44] <Cork> motaka2: cache: true is the default
[04:43:09] <Cork> motaka2: cache: false will add an uniq value to the url to escape the browsers cache
[04:43:25] <titii> Cork: u understand me a little?
[04:43:51] <Cork> titii: the browser won't scroll overflow elements without reason
[04:43:57] <Cork> at least i've never seen it happen
[04:44:15] <Cork> but there are a few reasons why an overflow element might not be at the top
[04:44:27] <titii> Cork: yea, and here i have this bug in webkit browser, so i am looking for solution
[04:44:45] <Cork> uh... like i said, it's most likely not a bug
[04:45:09] <Cork> so produce a testcase and we can have a look at what causes it
[04:45:26] <Cork> webchao: what exactly are you talking about?
[04:45:54] <webchao> Cork: i am talking about browsing the jquery source
[04:46:04] <titii> Cork: he is on top after document loaded, its ok. But in this header i Have absolute positiooned popups with some input fields, and when i click on input field, webkit jump me that overflow element into down! u know?
[04:46:06] <webchao> right now i use github
[04:46:16] <Cork> webchao: uh, opening the js file and read it?
[04:46:30] <Cork> code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[04:46:51] <webchao> Cork: yeah, i wondered if there was a place which had like, an annotated source
[04:47:03] <webchao> and links that leads to the definition of functions etc
[04:47:12] <webchao> but reading the raw source it is, then
[04:47:14] <Cork> webchao: no
[04:47:23] <Cork> if you want documentation that is in api.jquery.com
[04:48:03] <webchao> yeah i read the documentation to $.serializeArray, but now i am reading the source of it because the documentation couldn't answer my questions
[04:48:09] <webchao> is api.jquery.com a wiki?
[04:48:28] <titii> Cork: see this http://mticket.kreon.sk/www/, and click the search icon on the top in Chrome, but set the window into about 300px width, i mean get small window, u know
[04:48:28] <Cork> webchao: what is the problem you're trying to solve?
[04:49:40] <titii> Cork
[04:49:43] <titii> : u see?
[04:49:45] <webchao> i just wondered what rules exactly it took to serialize nodes in the jquery element... in this case, i have an input element nested in a div nested in a div, and nothing gets serialized... now i wonder why. let me paste up the markup in question
[04:50:08] <Cork> titii: no i don't see any problems
[04:50:31] <titii> cork: what? in chrome?
[04:50:36] <Cork> yes
[04:50:48] <webchao> but the source of serializeArray implies that it doesn't do recursive/nesting
[04:50:49] <titii> cork: did u set window small about 300px?
[04:50:56] <Cork> webchao: they 1. need to have a, 2. they need to not be disabled
[04:51:04] <Cork> webchao: other then that it should serialize just fine
[04:51:11] <webchao> need to have a name, you mean
[04:51:17] <Cork> yes
[04:51:32] <Cork> opps missed "name" there :P
[04:52:07] <titii> cork after window is small, then click on the search, here is focus on the input field, and see thje menu, some elements movings
[04:52:11] <titii> u have to see it
[04:53:02] <titii> because that element scrolls down by its self
[04:56:40] <Cork> webchao: but the filter applied is here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/serialize.js#L20
[04:57:43] <webchao> Cork: can you confirm too that it doesn't do recursion? because the <div> surely is not rsubmittablwe
[04:57:45] <webchao> -e
[04:57:48] <webchao> -w :)(
[04:57:49] <webchao> argh
[04:58:37] <Cork> webchao: it recurses
[04:58:58] <Cork> so no i can't :)
[04:59:13] <webchao> where exactly does that happen? >_>
[04:59:30] <Cork> line 12
[05:00:00] <webchao> huh?
[05:00:03] <Cork> or rather line 12 - line 16
[05:02:58] <Cork> webchao: http://jsfiddle.net/rdqHL/
[05:03:47] <webchao> Cork: it works obviously, but now i am utterly confused what i did wrong :) thanks for the help!
[05:04:43] <Cork> webchao: you have to either make a element selection, or use a form
[05:05:13] <Cork> a bit back it actually did a full recursive search, but it looks like that has been replaced with form.elements
[05:05:39] <Cork> but if you want a section do $(
[05:05:41] <Cork> bah
[05:05:59] <Cork> but if you want a section do $('#id').find(':input').serializeArray()
[05:07:08] <webchao> ok uhm, this code works in the jsfiddle but not in my own code... something is quite wrong here obviously :D
[05:08:05] <webchao> wait uhm
[05:11:42] <webchao> Cork: thanks very much for your help! the .find(":input") thing did it at last :) now i have what i want
[05:11:49] <webchao> sorry for being slow/stupid :P
[05:12:15] <Cork> heh, na it's not strange
[05:12:32] <Cork> especially as the form handling changes over time in jquery...
[05:29:40] <bytephilia> Cork: I got my slider working as I wanted. I was wondering if you could guide me as how to intialize it so that I can make the sliders start at something other than zero? http://pastie.org/private/gwmaoynyxkcmb292vvs5w
[05:31:04] <philhutchinson> bytephilia: change 'value' to something other than 0
[05:31:52] <Cork> bytephilia: ya, just set value or values and it should be the start position
[05:32:28] <bytephilia> Ah but what I really need also to do is run the slide method
[05:32:48] <bytephilia> Because it updates the values I'm working with - setting the value to something other than zero just changes the visual of the slider
[05:33:06] <bytephilia> So how can I run the slide method on document ready?
[05:33:24] <Cork> bytephilia: so just use a named function and then run it on page load
[05:38:55] <Mattias> I have a combobox in my form, well, three of them. How can I make it so 'enter' key does not submit the form when these 3 are in focus? I still want the enter key to submit like it usually does on all other fields
[05:39:37] <Cork> Mattias: you could check document.activeElement
[05:39:49] <Cork> (in the submit event)
[05:40:11] <Mattias> I'll try that :) thanks!
[05:40:22] <bytephilia> Cork: something like this? http://pastie.org/private/zr4cclcnyjeqmmxlmfeloa
[05:40:40] <bytephilia> I'm not proficient with JS, can you tell me what's wrong with what I changed?
[05:41:19] <Cork> bytephilia: except you will have to actually provide the values on line 22
[05:41:45] <bytephilia> oh raw value for ui?
[05:41:54] <bytephilia> like what? an integer?
[05:42:00] <Cork> bytephilia: actually, you could try trigger('slider')
[05:42:07] <Cork> not sure if that will work though
[05:42:19] <Cork> *trigger('slide')
[05:43:21] <bytephilia> Cork: where?
[05:43:30] <bytephilia> instead of using a named function?
[05:43:34] <Cork> yes
[05:43:43] <Cork> on the element you created the slider on
[05:44:02] <Cork> thought, like i said, i don't guarantee that it will work
[05:45:15] <bytephilia> but what about the named function approach? am I not close to doing it right with that?
[05:47:20] <Cork> you would have to produce the data structure your function expects
[05:47:41] <Cork> i don't think you use the event so something like (null, { value: <start value> }) should work
[05:53:49] <bytephilia> Cork: I'm wondering, aside from the initialization, after I made a named function and referenced it instead of using an anonymous one directly, it doesn't seem that the named function is even called when I move the sliders. Did I place it in the wrong location my code?
[05:54:14] <bytephilia> http://pastie.org/private/zr4cclcnyjeqmmxlmfeloa
[05:54:37] <bytephilia> Tried logging to console, nothing is logged when I move something
[05:54:48] <Cork> bytephilia: updateSlider isn't a member function, remove this.
[05:56:49] <bytephilia> thanks
[05:57:30] <bytephilia> perfect Cork
[05:57:35] <bytephilia> all working now
[06:01:00] <EdwardIII> hrm, masonry removed the animate option?

[06:21:44] <fesener_> would someone please help me ? i'm generating links like: <a href='#' id='gamename["+games[i]+"]'> how can i make "if a user clicks an id that contains gamename"
[06:22:16] <fesener_> i also want to use games[i] value in my onclick function
[06:22:22] <fesener_> how can I do this ?
[06:26:42] <fesener_> $('input[name*="gamename"]').on('click', function(){          console.log("link")           })
[06:26:46] <fesener_> doesnt work :/
[06:27:29] <Cork> fesener_: you can't have wildcards in id's
[06:27:40] <Cork> add a class to group the elements instead
[06:27:41] <fesener_> wildcards?
[06:28:05] <fesener_> so you want me to change id to class, thats all =
[06:28:06] <fesener_> ?
[06:29:38] <fesener_> Cork, changing to class didnt help
[06:30:27] <Cork> fesener_: i meant add a class like "gamename"
[06:30:34] <Cork> and then select $('.gamename'=
[06:30:37] <Cork> *)
[06:43:05] <X_Panni_X> Hey there, could someone tell me realy quick what causes the error or why the error occurs? Code+Error: http://pastebin.com/X4pmjyzq
[06:43:44] <Cork> X_Panni_X: check the code sent to the client not what you have in the server
[06:44:06] <Cork> X_Panni_X: but if that is what you do have in the sent data; you have php in there
[06:49:20] <fesener_> I have this: <span class='gamename["+games[i]+"] label label-info'>" +games[i] + "</span> code and now I can detect if an element starts with "gamename" but can I get games[i] variable too and use it on my onclick function?
[06:50:30] <Cork> <span class='gamename label label-info' data-gamename='"+games[i]+"'>" +games[i] + "</span>
[06:50:40] <Cork> then just grab it with .data('gamename')
[06:50:50] <Cork> or actaully just do
[06:51:01] <Cork> <span class='gamename label label-info'>" +games[i] + "</span> and grab it with .text()
[06:51:34] <fesener_> ok Cork i'll try it now
[06:53:36] <fesener_> Cork, .text() worked great thank you so much
[07:01:50] <X_Panni_X> Hey there could someone check my code and maybe tell me what is wrong? :) Code: http://pastebin.com/kpgKkrrW
[07:02:54] <Cork> X_Panni_X: like i said before, check the generated html instead of the php code
[07:03:22] <Cork> X_Panni_X: oh, btw you can't load a script resource and have inline script in the same tag
[07:03:54] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/
[07:04:39] <Skizu> How do I clone an element and so it doesn't have the current input also cloned
[07:05:32] <X_Panni_X> Cork: What do you mean with "generated HTML"?
[07:05:34] <Cork> Skizu: don't use live it has been deprecated for ages, and removed
[07:05:45] <Cork> X_Panni_X: php runs server side
[07:05:54] <X_Panni_X> Cork: yea
[07:06:00] <Cork> it generates a text stream, that text is then parsed client side
[07:06:20] <Skizu> Panni look at line 4 and 5 they make no sense :)
[07:06:22] <Cork> so separate the server code from the client code by checking the text the php script generates instead of the php scriopt
[07:06:27] <Cork> *script
[07:06:40] <Skizu> Cork, what should I use?
[07:06:46] <Cork> ?.delegate
[07:06:47] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:06:48] <Cork> or ?.on
[07:06:52] <Cork> ?.on
[07:06:55] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:07:53] <Skizu> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/1/ still a problem
[07:10:38] <Cork> Skizu: http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/2/
[07:10:58] <X_Panni_X> I still don't get it <.< General question: How can I set a variable in php using $_GET and then use it in a javascript?
[07:11:21] <Cork> X_Panni_X: if it is on page load, just echo it in the page
[07:11:30] <Cork> X_Panni_X: if it isn't on page load; you can't
[07:11:42] <Cork> you would have to do an ajax request then
[07:11:51] <Cork> X_Panni_X: but did you see my second comment about the page
[07:12:03] <anew> ok... so if i have a return true on my ajax, and i load a template in that ajax.  do i need to write all my js code inside that ajax success now?  will it not work otherwise ?
[07:12:04] <Cork> X_Panni_X: you can't both reference a resource and have inline script in the same tag
[07:12:16] <fesener_> How can I update a dynamically generated <div>'s content ? Would someone help me?
[07:12:26] <Cork> anew: return won't do anything from an ajax callback
[07:12:32] <gho5t> fesener_: .text()
[07:12:37] <Cork> $('div').html('new content')
[07:12:58] <fesener_> well since that 'div' is being created after page load, it cant find it
[07:13:06] <anew> cork i dont mean return, i mean the success part of the ajax call
[07:13:06] <Skizu> Cork, some new things there, what does delegate do exactly in a sentance?
[07:13:26] <anew> if success comes back true... does all js code need to now go inside there? i'm loading a template
[07:13:33] <anew> let me try because there is no other way it seems to be working
[07:13:36] <gho5t> fesener_: then select it after it's created
[07:13:43] <fesener_> how ?
[07:13:44] <Cork> anew: everything need to happen inside a callback, if it is in the options to ajax, or a deferred assignment is up to you
[07:14:07] <gho5t> you have to give more info
[07:14:11] <gho5t> where is it being created
[07:14:14] <Cork> Skizu: it does the same thing as live, but live has a broken syntax so stop using it
[07:14:22] <anew> so if u want chained templates, like one loads after another after another
[07:14:30] <anew> if ur not using a js framework that can get really messy cant it
[07:14:45] <Skizu> I changed live to on :(, awesome seems like change isn't triggered on a select :/?
[07:15:07] <Cork> anew: function loader() { return $.ajax(); }; loader().done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {})
[07:15:15] <fesener_> gho5t, a signal send a user list to my client, if a user clicks on any item on this userlist I'm creating a new tab and I want to change a <div>'s content in this tab with another signal
[07:15:31] <Cork> Skizu: it is, didn't the last link i gave you work for you?
[07:15:48] <Skizu> Nope have a look yourself :/
[07:15:52] <BillCriswell> Cork: I started to notice a pattern half way through that.
[07:15:55] <Cork> Skizu: btw notice that if you pick on you need to use the delegate syntax
[07:16:02] <gho5t> fesener_: so select the div when you create the new tab
[07:16:33] <Skizu> Cork, not following your last comment there :/
[07:16:42] <Cork> Skizu: http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/3/
[07:16:45] <Cork> use 2 or 3
[07:17:02] <Cork> BillCriswell: pattern through what?
[07:17:03] <anew> cork damn... now i see the point of js frameworks
[07:17:28] <anew> i think
[07:17:28] <anew> lol
[07:17:49] <Skizu> Ahhh I've found my error, I need to change it to be select.multi or input.multi or textarea.multi
[07:18:02] <Skizu> How do I do an or selector thing?
[07:18:32] <Cork> Skizu: 'input.multi, textarea.multi, select.multi'
[07:18:38] <Skizu> Ah simple enough
[07:18:50] <Cork> or simply do '.multi'
[07:20:07] <Skizu> Ahaha I see http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/4/ I did this to make it a bit safer as not too sure on what else is going on
[07:20:23] <BillCriswell> Cork: .done().done().done().done()
[07:20:29] <Cork> ah :D
[07:33:44] <horacsio> need to go back: http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/548/ and add fadein fadeout transitions: how?!
[07:33:58] <spobat> is it possible to get only a single module from jquery ui?
[07:34:08] <spobat> All i need from jquery ui is sortable: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[07:34:30] <Kingsy> if you have something like content: "hello"   in a function, how do you span it over two lines?
[07:34:30] <Cork> spobat: sure, go to the download page and pick the parts you want
[07:35:01] <Cork> Kingsy: that question doesn't really make sense
[07:35:12] <spobat> Cork: okay,thanks
[07:35:34] <Kingsy> Cork: heh, say --> content: "helllo there is alot of text to make this readable on one line"
[07:35:44] <Kingsy> content: "helllo there is alot
[07:35:55] <Kingsy>               of text to make this readable on one line"
[07:36:06] <Kingsy> is an error isnt it?
[07:36:07] <Cork> are you talking about css now?
[07:36:16] <NoiseEee> Kingsy: change the width of the container via css?
[07:36:17] <Kingsy> hrm, perhaps the IDE is doing something funny
[07:36:21] <Cork> or what function would this be for?
[07:37:13] <Kingsy> no, I am talking about in the jquery function declaration, in the code
[07:37:25] <Cork> Kingsy: what declaration
[07:37:29] <Cork> ?p @ Kingsy
[07:37:29] <bot-t> Kingsy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:39:16] <Kingsy> Cork: http://pastie.org/8131369
[07:39:30] <Cork> ah, så qtip
[07:39:33] <Cork> *so
[07:40:00] <Kingsy> but I kinda assumed it was a generic syntax question
[07:40:12] <Cork> Kingsy: try adding a "<br>" in there
[07:40:23] <Cork> Kingsy: no not really
[07:40:36] <gho5t> Kingsy: +
[07:40:42] <Kingsy> Cork: it doesnt matter, thanks for your help, I am not explaining myself correctly
[07:41:00] <Kingsy> gho5t: ah, you concat with + ?
[07:41:23] <gho5t> yep
[07:41:24] <Cork> uh, ya, if you don't want the linebreak in the resulting output
[07:41:49] <jmar777> Kingsy: "foo" + "bar" works as long as the new lines are outside of the "..."
[07:41:55] <Kingsy> ahhh that worked.. you can just use '+'
[07:41:59] <jmar777> Kingsy: or, alternatively you can escape the newlines with \
[07:42:09] <Kingsy> oh really?? cool
[07:42:24] <jmar777> Kingsy: e.g., "hello \<new-line> world"
[07:42:49] <jmar777> Kingsy: although that's somewhat hacky... I prefer to just concat multiple strings
[07:42:50] <Kingsy> works perfectly thankyou
[07:42:56] <Kingsy> yeah I will use +
[07:42:59] <Cork> the \ is a bit messy though, cause indents will be in the string
[07:43:12] <Kingsy> Cork: I am sorry for my terrible explanation
[07:43:20] <Kingsy> got there in the end :D
[07:43:26] <Cork> Kingsy: it was kinda hard to get the question :)
[07:43:41] <Kingsy> hehe I know I know :S
[08:03:40] <cusco> hi
[08:04:40] <cusco> can I loop with .each? in a #div for every <span class='xyz'>
[08:04:41] <cusco> ?
[08:06:27] <cusco> trying $('#wizMsg span[class=wizReply]') ...
[08:07:01] <mikecmpbll> $('#wizMsg span.wizReply')..
[08:07:11] <jawr> hey, is it possible to ask a question about jQueryFileUpload?
[08:07:17] <cusco> thanks mikecmpbll
[08:07:19] <jedimind> you tell us jawr
[08:07:23] <BillCriswell> jawr: You kind of just did.
[08:07:28] <mikecmpbll> haha.
[08:07:44] <jawr> i know, but some channels don't really like discussing affiliated stuff
[08:08:16] <jawr> just trying to gauge etiquette
[08:08:56] <jedimind> i think you've sufficiently gauged it
[08:09:04] <jedimind> in as much as you should probably just ask your question :)
[08:09:41] <jawr> basically, i have it setup based on the stable release offered and using pieces of demo code
[08:09:54] <jawr> but when i submit the POST is always nigh on empty
[08:10:06] <jawr> no idea if this is a common problem
[08:10:21] <jedimind> NO ASKING ABOUT OTHER LIBRARIES
[08:10:22] <jedimind> jesus christ
[08:10:31] <BillCriswell> =)
[08:10:58] <BillCriswell> jawr: Is the form set up properly and do the elements have names? Does the server allow file uploads?
[08:11:04] <jawr> Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files[]"; filename=""
[08:11:26] <jedimind> jawr is your console throwing up any errors?
[08:11:43] <jawr> yeah i'm using django as the server (devel server atm), and the form i'm using is essentially the same one provided in his demo
[08:11:47] <jawr> no errors
[08:12:01] <jawr> and i get partial info in the POST when i print it out
[08:12:23] <mu> I have a set of matched elements and an array of text that I'd like to put into each element such that the first element has array[0], second element has array[1], etc... Is there a jQuery method to make this happen?
[08:12:38] <jawr> i set a csrf token and it appears, the files[] key also exists but is blankl
[08:13:04] <BillCriswell> Do you have enctype="multipart/form-data" on the form?
[08:13:12] <BillCriswell> Does the server allow file uploads?
[08:13:42] <jawr> <form class="form" id="fileupload" action="/snapshots/upload/" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
[08:13:58] <jawr> i have never had issues with file uploads on the server before
[08:14:15] <jawr> i have been bullied into trying ember.js, so i'm blaming it on that
[08:15:21] <jawr> snapshots/upload/ is essentially a stub that prints out POST and returns a valid http response
[08:15:25] <jawr> for testing ofc
[08:15:35] <jawr> but even if i look at the request headers it's blank
[08:15:53] <jawr> let me paste some code i guess
[08:17:48] <jawr> http://codepad.org/OgWZFkTK
[08:18:31] <BillCriswell> jawr: What happens with files instead of files[] ?
[08:18:39] <jawr> let me give it a go
[08:19:42] <jawr> the same unfortunatly
[08:19:45] <BillCriswell> On the inputs name*
[08:19:50] <BillCriswell> Should have specified.
[08:21:32] <BillCriswell> and does it work if you remove the plugin all together? Does the files array get populated?
[08:21:44] <jawr> i haven't tried that
[08:21:56] <jawr> you mean, just have it as a non parsed form?
[08:22:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, minus the plugin.
[08:22:37] <jawr> yeah, if i don't use the plugin it works
[08:22:43] <jawr> i can see the filenames in the header
[08:22:58] <jawr> so 100% caused by the plugin, nice shout
[08:23:33] <ryy> Hello,  This is driving me batty: How do I retrieve the href attribute of an element that has been loaded with ajax?
[08:23:53] <jedimind> same way you would any other element?
[08:23:59] <jedimind> you just wont be able to do it on document.ready
[08:24:04] <jedimind> you have to do it at the point that you're triggering your event
[08:24:36] <BillCriswell> jawr: Ok. Hmmm
[08:25:06] <ryy> I understand.  I was trying to do it on doc.ready.  Thanks.
[08:25:42] <jawr> well, i might just proceed without using the plugin and come back to it later
[08:25:52] <jawr> it's very weird, it has always been plug and play before
[08:26:28] <BillCriswell> jawr: Might be nothing... but what if you wrap all that HTML in the form tag? The way it's set up now it looks pretty misformed?
[08:26:31] <BillCriswell> Is that a word?
[08:26:34] <BillCriswell> malformed?
[08:26:55] <jawr> malformed is yeah
[08:27:03] <BillCriswell> There we go.
[08:27:07] <jawr> it might break the modal, but let's see
[08:27:12] <BillCriswell> Ok
[08:27:39] <BillCriswell> It's like open in one div and closed in another.
[08:28:14] <jawr> it looks fine wrapped, but still no joy
[08:28:19] <Bloomberg> Hello guys!!
[08:28:20] <BillCriswell> ah.
[08:28:28] <jawr> yeah, my hack-ery
[08:28:28] <Bloomberg> How can I set this  ::  $("form").html('<fieldset>'.data.'</fieldset>');
[08:28:45] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: + not .
[08:28:57] <Bloomberg> Show me error
[08:28:58] <Bloomberg> data is a var of a function
[08:29:16] <jawr> + is for string concat not .
[08:29:22] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You can't concatenate a string with a .
[08:29:24] <Bloomberg> Thanks man
[08:29:27] <Bloomberg> Almost I forget it
[08:30:12] <jawr> brr, i'm so tempted to just drop- this plugin for the time being. but i like the validation and what not i can do with it
[08:30:23] <jawr> am i not pushing it back on to the file set properly or something
[08:30:37] <jawr> it's as though i'm parsing it and then not doing anything with it hmm
[08:30:40] <burg> hello. how can i select all divs having an id that begins with something-
[08:31:29] <BillCriswell> burg: div[id^=something-]
[08:32:04] <jawr> BillCriswell is on fire :D
[08:32:12] <burg> BillCriswell, thank you
[08:32:20] <BillCriswell> I'm good with the easy stuff!
[08:33:46] <BillCriswell> burg: Welcome
[08:34:58] <BillCriswell> jawr: Wait... why is multipart false?
[08:36:07] <jawr> that was me trying alternatives, I have tried it withough
[08:36:29] <jawr> alternatives in desperation
[08:36:54] <BillCriswell> My least favorite part haha.
[08:37:08] <jawr> yeah hacking is rubbish
[08:37:19] <jawr> getting it done the first time is so much more fun
[08:37:25] <mentoc> if I use $("#input[type=text]").on("click",function(){}); //Does that iterate over all input text boxes?
[08:37:35] <jawr> i wanted to do this whole thing in standard django, but no, i have to use ember :p
[08:38:04] <BillCriswell> mentoc: The # seems out of place.
[08:38:17] <mentoc> BillCriswell: heh oops. Without the pound
[08:38:28] <BillCriswell> Then yes. It'll go to all of them.
[08:38:38] <BillCriswell> jawr: I keep trying that out and putting it down.
[08:38:45] <mentoc> awesome. I almost thought I had to use a $.each
[08:39:03] <jawr> i'm really not to much of a js coder, just used some jquery here and there
[08:39:08] <jawr> so it's kind of new
[08:39:09] <BillCriswell> jawr: Been playing with angularjs and it's making more sense than ember, but I still have a ways to go with it.
[08:39:09] <marcules> I always thought quotes were mandatory for attribute-selectors
[08:39:18] <jawr> seems weird having django just being a rest api
[08:39:37] <jawr> not looked at angular, but i know it has bigger backing
[08:39:56] <BillCriswell> marcules: If it has spaces or weird caracters you  should, but it's not needed with a simple string like that
[08:39:59] <BillCriswell> characters*
[08:40:07] <BillCriswell> jawr: It clicked a lot quicker for me.
[08:40:21] <jawr> probably why it has bigger backing :D
[08:40:28] <BillCriswell> jawr: Haha yes.
[08:40:30] <jawr> i might just go back to standard django
[08:40:38] <DrogoNevets> hi all, have the following html (snippet) http://pastebin.com/sauktC1i
[08:40:38] <marcules> hmm I'm setting them anyways, just to be on the safe... save... safe... side D
[08:40:40] <marcules> :D
[08:40:41] <jawr> was fun and it's nice having a quick feel
[08:41:02] <DrogoNevets> the js at the bottom of that isnt working as the next element isnt an input, whats the best way to traverse to the next input??
[08:42:56] <BillCriswell> jawr: I agree. Hate the unnecessary headache but it's kind of fun at the start.
[08:43:02] <BillCriswell> marcules: Haha
[08:44:30] <jawr> anyway, cheers for your time BillCriswell
[08:44:50] <marcules> DrogoNevets, maybe .siblings('input').first()
[08:44:54] <BillCriswell> jawr: Welcome. Wish I could help further!
[08:45:24] <BillCriswell> DrogoNevets: .nextAll('input').first()
[08:45:51] <BillCriswell> marcules: siblings() I'd think would start at the "left" children?
[08:45:51] <marcules> Oh wait.. siblings would return always the first input, wouldn't it?
[08:46:04] <BillCriswell> marcules: I believe so.
[08:46:13] <DrogoNevets> marcules, BillCriswell: yea that was my issue, ill try nextAll()
[08:48:32] <DrogoNevets> BillCriswell: that worked a charm, cheers
[08:48:44] <DrogoNevets> marcules: thanks for the help, but alas BillCriswell was right ;)
[08:49:26] <BillCriswell> Awwww yeah.
[08:49:29] <marcules> I thought so :D
[08:55:18] <DrogoNevets> thanks for the help guys
[09:06:53] <horacsio> anyone?
[09:07:39] <horacsio> next and previous with fadeout and fadein effect? http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/548/
[09:10:38] <BillCriswell> horacsio: You just want to move along the siblings?
[09:11:38] <horacsio> fadeout div1 fadein div2
[09:11:47] <horacsio> at the end it may go to div1 again
[09:12:28] <BillCriswell> .next() and .prev() would help you out a lot there.
[09:14:07] <horacsio> so with this script I won't be able to do it?
[09:15:04] <BillCriswell> No you can.
[09:15:48] <horacsio> how? :S
[09:35:46] <BillCriswell> horacsio: http://jsbin.com/eyedaq/1/edit I got bored... you can add the effects pretty easily, but the logic should be ok.
[09:36:07] <horacsio> thank you ;)
[09:36:30] <BillCriswell> Basically, check the $active.prev().length and if it's not 1 switch to the last, and the next is similar.
[09:39:03] <chris_c> I also was bored: http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/549/
[09:39:16] <chris_c> I think Bill's is better though
[09:47:34] <spobat> hi
[09:47:44] <chris_c> hi
[09:48:04] <spobat> how do you manage huge js projects? (I currently have about 30 - is that "huge?").
[09:48:16] <spobat> 30 files *
[09:49:16] <torlanco_> cptmemi: hello
[09:49:29] <gho5t> define "manage"
[09:49:39] <Cptmemi> Hi!
[09:50:32] <torlanco_> Could some one please explain Cptmemi why the 'on' event handler on parents is better that using live click?
[09:51:24] <spobat> gho5t: What I have right now is that each js file represents a "module" - implemented as a single function basically
[09:51:39] <spobat> whereas this function acts like a class
[09:51:58] <Cork> torlanco: what $('selector').live does is: 1.  $('selector')  this runs through the dom looking for element matching the selector
[09:52:11] <Cork> torlanco: 2. collects the matched elements in an array
[09:53:12] <Cork> torlanco: 3. throws away the array of matched elements and uses the string stored in jquery (this.selector) does $(document).bind('event', function() { /* check if selector matches and calls your callback */ })
[09:53:58] <Cork> torlanco: while .on or .delegate runs $(document).delegate/on(event, 'selector') so no search, no array, and no waisted work
[09:55:01] <torlanco_> Cork: that is an awesome response! Thank you very much. I was showing my brother the benefits of this irc channel and the on event / live
[09:55:08] <torlanco_> He is very much amazed
[09:56:46] <gho5t> I want a brother who programs too
[09:57:04] <gho5t> how much did he cost
[09:57:28] <BillCriswell> gho5t: Could you imagine those pissing matches? "I can code this faster than you"
[09:57:28] <Cork> lol, a fortune
[09:57:50] <gho5t> BillCriswell: yeah I bet it would get pretty competitive
[09:58:48] <BillCriswell> devdocs.io is about to be my homepage.
[09:59:04] <BillCriswell> There's no greater honor than that.
[09:59:17] <BillCriswell> from me, at least.
[10:00:26] <Brutick> BillCriswell: devdocs.io is awesome! Why didn't I know about this before D:
[10:00:29] <PatrikOlsson> Hi all, I'm building a single-page site using html css and jquery. I have a main menu that uses .click() on its list items to redirect the user. Though I do not understand where/when I shall initialize this function. Shall I do it in startup or shall I never "run" the code? :/
[10:00:49] <BillCriswell> Brutick: I just heard about it like a week ago.. I think it's relatively new?
[10:01:35] <PatrikOlsson> Right now the function looks like this: http://pastebin.com/QU9Rq0eh
[10:04:00] <PatrikOlsson> Nevermind, I think I just understood how the jQuery code works!
[10:05:29] <spobat> which of these two class designs is better and why? http://ideone.com/pJQcLG
[10:08:06] <Brutick> spobat: I feel like it's more just personal preference than what is more right or wrong.
[10:08:48] <Cork> spobat: one advantages to the second one is that it can have private variables/functions shared between the public functions
[10:10:19] <BillCriswell> spobat: What cork said is the only thing I can really think of.
[10:11:34] <spobat> okay, thank you
[10:11:50] <Cork> spobat: though that said, i personally prefer to use prototype if you build full object structure
[10:12:04] <Cork> can save some memory that way
[10:13:59] <spobat> Cork: do you mean the first one?
[10:14:16] <Cork> spobat: none of them actually
[10:14:55] <spobat> Cork: how does it work?
[10:15:01] <fartface> Hey!  How can I ensure my code runs linear (one line ran after the previous line has completed executing)?
[10:15:19] <Cork> spobat:  function C() { return new this.init() } C.prototype = { init: function() {}, ... };
[10:15:55] <BillCriswell> fartface: That happens automatically unless you're making asynchronous events.
[10:15:56] <spobat> fartface: that is the stardard if you use synchronous methonds
[10:15:59] <Cork> spobat: but that is only interesting if you want to have uniq object instances
[10:16:03] <BillCriswell> s/events/requests
[10:16:08] <anew> stupid question but if i am storing $().click() inside a var...it's not working
[10:16:16] <losted> Hello all, I would like to know how you guys would optimize this piece of code please if someone is kind enough to show me some best practices! http://pastebin.com/cXBG8pQm  thanks!
[10:16:27] <spobat> Cork: like singletons?
[10:17:13] <BillCriswell> losted: input[type=checkbox]:checked can simple be :checked
[10:17:45] <Cork> spobat: kinda, but not really
[10:17:52] <fartface> Bill: that's what I figured, but it doesn't seem to be the case.  I'll have to look into it further.
[10:17:55] <losted> Good one BillCriswell thanks
[10:18:14] <fartface> My code that is, not jQuery itself.  I'm presuming it's user-error haha
[10:18:44] <BillCriswell> losted: $(selected_group_el) seems weird inside the callback? Do you want the one you defined before?
[10:18:58] <BillCriswell> Oh nevermind. Didn't notice it was singular.
[10:20:46] <spobat> Cork: what would you improve on here?
[10:20:46] <spobat> http://ideone.com/Y9ZgwN
[10:21:36] <Cork> spobat: that depends on what structure you want to build
[10:24:28] <anew> seems when templating you cant nest them?
[10:24:31] <anew> bleh
[10:25:06] <spobat> Cork: I see
[10:25:08] <wcwrel> how i set the application icon?
[10:25:16] <spobat> favicon?

[10:59:25] <spobat> can I tell jquery to cache a selector, because I know it'll happen again?
[10:59:27] <spobat> e.g. $('#channels-list > li')
[10:59:53] <BillCriswell> spobat: var $channelItems = $('#channels-list > li');
[11:00:01] <Cork> the $ is optional
[11:00:10] <BillCriswell> Yesh.
[11:00:11] <spobat> well this thing is called upon different modules
[11:00:14] <spobat> they are not connected
[11:00:20] <BillCriswell> My reasoning is so I know it's a jquery object.
[11:00:35] <spobat> BillCriswell: interesting naming convention :)
[11:00:40] <Cork> spobat: you could have a global variable that both could access
[11:00:53] <spobat> well then I better leave it as is, i think that selector is fast
[11:01:20] <Cork> spobat: it is quite common, it can be that 99% of all your variables starts with $ and then it just becomes noise though
[11:01:54] <BillCriswell> and start looking all PHPie.
[11:02:33] <spobat> is > * faster than > li ?
[11:02:45] <BillCriswell> No.
[11:03:04] <spobat> because there are no other children it wouldn't matter for e
[11:03:05] <spobat> me *
[11:03:07] <Cork> spobat: also note that #id li is faster then #id > li
[11:03:22] <spobat> Cork: sure?
[11:03:26] <Cork> yes
[11:03:29] <spobat> why?
[11:03:43] <Cork> cause it will select from right to left
[11:03:57] <Cork> $('#id').children() is prob the fastest you can get
[11:04:14] <spobat> Cork: good proposal!
[11:04:22] <Xal_> If I'm cycling through divs in an each() function, can I use $(this) as the element in $.data()?
[11:04:23] <Cork> cause the in makes an id lookup and then just gets the children from the dom references
[11:04:26] <BillCriswell> None of this will make a huge difference more than likely.
[11:05:10] <Cork> none of this will most likely make any measurable difference unless you run it tens or possibly hundreds of times a second
[11:05:40] <Cork> Xal_: $(this).data() is prob what you want; but yes
[11:06:03] <Cork> Xal_: and that is if you by each mean $().each, $.each does not set this
[11:06:09] <Xal_> I tried using that once before and it didn't work at all
[11:06:24] <durango> How do I set the header request in ajaxPrefilter? basically I have this.. http://pastie.org/private/cveddaqkmdqdiroji0rgjw <-- which looks for data.errors in json if so execute the flash() command and return false BUT the problem is.. for some reason, the headers are sending "accept text/html" which is obviously not what i want but i want json
[11:06:33] <Cork> Xal_: then you're doing something wrong
[11:06:33] <durango> using latest jquery btw ^
[11:06:36] <Xal_> Yeah $("..").each()
[11:06:53] <BillCriswell> Xal_: $.data( this, 'foo', 'bar' ) === $(this).data('foo', 'bar') I think...
[11:07:35] <Cork> ya
[11:11:02] <bjorn_> hey quick question
[11:11:07] <bjorn_> how can i disable an <a> tag
[11:11:10] <bjorn_> and then re enable it
[11:11:19] <bjorn_> like where it is not clickable
[11:11:22] <spobat> why does jquery evaluate $('') from right to left?
[11:11:48] <myosotis> bjorn_, http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:11:55] <Cork> bjorn_: $(document).on('click', 'a.disabled', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[11:12:14] <Cork> bjorn_: and then just set a disabled class on the links you want to disable
[11:12:30] <Cork> spobat: cause that is how css selector works
[11:12:57] <bjorn_> kk
[11:13:03] <bjorn_> and then i can remove the prevent default
[11:13:04] <bjorn_> later
[11:13:06] <Cork> spobat: $() is mainly just a compatibility wrapper around document.querySelectorAll
[11:13:19] <Cork> (and the equiv for older ie browsers)
[11:13:31] <spobat> I use jquery 2 :}
[11:13:45] <Cork> ya, and then there equiv is removed
[11:14:09] <Cork> sizzle extends the selector support a bit though
[11:14:10] <spobat> god, I do not even support IE 9 or 10 :)
[11:14:34] <Cork> spobat: you should support ie10, there isn't really any reason not to
[11:14:36] <spobat> IE10 is at the technological level of chrome 13 ._.
[11:14:43] <Cork> and ie9 is actually quite easy to support too
[11:14:54] <spobat> hint: the current chrome version is 27
[11:14:58] <Cork> spobat: sure it is old, and behind
[11:15:10] <Cork> but that doesn't mean you should ignore it
[11:15:17] <myosotis> IE has make GREAT strides, but still makes me angry daily
[11:15:35] <spobat> ie has merely a marketshare of 10 % and my user base is young and knowledgable about computers :P
[11:16:08] <snover> p.s. this is a dumb conversation
[11:16:41] <myosotis> perhaps to you, but not everybody is so lucky
[11:17:10] <Cork> spobat: not sure what stats you look at but as far as i know ie has ~23-25%
[11:17:39] <spobat> Cork:

[11:18:33] <Cork> that is still not perfect
[11:18:39] <Cork> but it is at least closer to the truth
[11:19:30] <Cork> spobat: if you want statistics on browser shares, not check the stats for a developer documentation site :)
[11:19:39] <Cork> *do not check
[11:19:45] <durango> How do I set the header request in ajaxPrefilter? basically I have this.. http://pastie.org/private/cveddaqkmdqdiroji0rgjw <-- which looks for data.errors in json if so execute the flash() command and return false BUT the problem is.. for some reason, the headers are sending "accept text/html" which is obviously not what i want but i want json <-- using latest jquery

[11:21:31] <spobat> Cork: why should they want to fake it?
[11:21:59] <Cork> spobat: it is not fake
[11:22:06] <Cork> spobat: but it is just for there site
[11:22:22] <Cork> and as it is only about development, most normal users won't visit it
[11:22:37] <Cork> so you will get a VERY skewed picture
[11:22:38] <spobat> I get it
[11:23:12] <Cork> but that is just about the stats though :)
[11:23:36] <Cork> there documentation is a much worse problem

[11:30:27] <blindMoe> 20 years of IRC and not sure I have seen that one
[11:30:57] <Trenal> Is it not a legit question for this channel or something?
[11:30:58] <BillCriswell> I see it on reddit a lot. It really encompasses how I feel to that question.
[11:30:59] <blindMoe> guess you would utf-8
[11:31:06] <jimi_> We use jQuery() instead of $() , how can I do the equiv of $(document).find('.partial_class')
[11:31:26] <BillCriswell> jimi_: jQuery(document).find('.partial_class')
[11:31:36] <blindMoe> hehe you answered your own question inside of your question :)
[11:31:47] <blindMoe> man programming with a cold sucks
[11:31:52] <blindMoe> figurd you all should know that
[11:31:56] <BillCriswell> Boogies on the keyboard?
[11:31:56] <jimi_> lol
[11:32:03] <Cork> Trenal: you are prob better of looking in channels for contracts/hire similar
[11:32:06] <BillCriswell> My whole office has a cold besides me.
[11:32:15] <Cork> i know there is one on this network, though i don't remember the name
[11:32:19] <jimi_> BillCriswell, .find find's partials, right so .find('.foo') will find foo_bar_baz?
[11:32:27] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: opposite here... I am the only one... I think it is because I just celebrated the 4th better than anyone else in here
[11:32:50] <BillCriswell> Haha that was many days ago.
[11:32:59] <BillCriswell> Oh, only a week.
[11:33:05] <BillCriswell> This week really is going slow.
[11:33:34] <BillCriswell> jimi_: You kind of lost me.
[11:33:51] <jimi_> BillCriswell, I have a class that has a random string at the end. I only want to find the first portion that I know
[11:34:00] <blindMoe> does .find() do partials?
[11:34:11] <Cork> jimi_: you can't really search for class partials
[11:34:15] <blindMoe> I have never heard that.. and it wouldn't make sense
[11:34:21] <Cork> jimi_: and there is no need for it
[11:34:34] <Cork> jimi_: split the class up, you can use class combos
[11:34:51] <BillCriswell> jimi_: What Cork said is right. However, $('[class*=foo]') could work I guess?
[11:34:55] <Cork> class="foo bar baz" $('.foo.bar')
[11:35:09] <blindMoe> is it not possible to use a regexp selector?
[11:35:15] <Cork> ya, but you would lose all the benifits of using classes
[11:35:44] <Cork> blindMoe: to some degree yes, but it is slow, and really not needed if you write your classes correctly
[11:35:54] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: You could .filter() with a regex, nothing right in the selector, though.
[11:35:58] <blindMoe> jimi_:  [11:35:15] <Cork> ya, but you would lose all the benifits of using classes
[11:36:01] <BillCriswell> Truth.
[11:36:02] <blindMoe> what the heck
[11:36:05] <blindMoe> I didn't copy that
[11:36:12] <blindMoe> let's try this again
[11:36:13] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Magic!
[11:36:15] <blindMoe> jimi_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5733881/jquery-regex-selector
[11:36:18] <blindMoe> that's better
[11:36:36] <BillCriswell> Ugh, people are pooping all over jQuery.
[11:37:02] <Cork> blindMoe: works != better... ;P
[11:37:15] <blindMoe> Cork: agreed.. but the idea is there
[11:37:35] <Cork> but honestly, if you need to search for parts of a class name, you have missed large parts of the point with classes
[11:37:37] <BillCriswell> $('a').filter(function(){ return /^[a-c]/.test(this.className); })
[11:37:48] <BillCriswell> Cork: Absolutely.
[11:37:53] <blindMoe> Cork: agreed
[11:38:08] <BillCriswell> Cork: I always assume if someone needs to do something like that they have no control over the HTML.
[11:38:21] <Cork> classes is fast and extremely flexible if you use them correctly
[11:38:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya, and i cry a little every time i hear someone saying they have no server access...
[11:39:04] <Eviltwin> BillCriswell: Can't possibly be as bad as when I did this: window.$ = (function($) { return function () { var results = $.apply(this, arguments); return $.extend(new Number(results.length), results); }; })(window.$);
[11:39:07] <Cork> i hear it more and more lately too...
[11:39:26] <Cork> wtf...
[11:39:33] <Eviltwin> It allowed me to do if ($('selector') == {{expected length}})
[11:40:10] <Cork> Eviltwin: why on earth would you want to?
[11:40:21] <Eviltwin> Becasuse typing length takes too long
[11:40:27] <Cork> -_-'
[11:40:32] <Eviltwin> jQuery isn't supposed to use long things
[11:40:37] <Eviltwin> It's supposed to be doing more with less
[11:40:40] <BillCriswell> They weren't thinking when they made length 6 letters really.
[11:41:04] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I never actually used this for anything it was more of a curiosity to see if it could work
[11:41:50] <Eviltwin> I was originally hoping to make $(...) still work normally if no elements but also have a falsy value
[11:41:58] <Eviltwin> Which I'm pretty sure is impossible
[11:42:00] <Deele> does anybody know, why twitter bootstrap creators are such an issues with "bad experience" nad "There is absolutely no way we're supporting [...]"?
[11:43:59] <BillCriswell> Any bootstrap creators here?
[11:44:10] <Cork> BillCriswell: Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, 'l', { get: function() { return this.length; } }
[11:44:15] <Cork> there done ;P
[11:44:24] <BillCriswell> I wasn't trying to do anything like that haha.
[11:45:08] <Cork> opps missed a ); there...
[11:45:50] <Cork> ?eval Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, 'l', { get: function() { return this.length; } }); var a =[1,2,3,4,5]; a.l
[11:45:53] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: Object.defineProperty is not a function
[11:46:03] <Cork> bleh...
[11:46:06] <Cork> bot-t: your old
[11:46:08] <bot-t> Cork, Download jQuery | jQuery - http://jquery.com/download/
[11:46:12] <BillCriswell> Cork: I got you now haha.
[11:46:38] <BillCriswell> I love bots.
[11:46:47] <Cork> js> Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, 'l', { get: function() { return this.length; } }); var a =[1,2,3,4,5]; print(a.l)
[11:46:53] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[11:46:57] <Cork> uh
[11:47:42] <Cork> man wonder what ecma specs these bots supports...
[11:48:35] <BillCriswell> Cork: How would I do Array.prototype.l = function(){ return this.length; } without having to call array.l() ?
[11:48:50] <BillCriswell> If it's not in jQuery i'm pretty lost to be honest.
[11:49:00] <Cork> BillCriswell: getters
[11:49:01] <shoky> the way he just showed you ;p
[11:49:29] <Cork> ?eval Array.prototype.__defineGetter__('l', function() { return this.length; }); var a =[1,2,3,4,5]; a.l
[11:49:30] <bot-t> Cork: 5
[11:49:31] <BillCriswell> Could you do that without Object.defineProperty() ?
[11:49:36] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhh
[11:49:37] <BillCriswell> duh.
[11:49:40] <Cork> BillCriswell: there you go, the old standard
[11:49:49] <Cork> the first one is the new spec
[11:49:50] <BillCriswell> Never played with this stuff.
[11:50:08] <Cork> it's actually really interesting
[11:50:29] <Cork> ?eval Array.prototype.__defineGetter__('length', function() { return 0; }); var a =[1,2,3,4,5]; a.length
[11:50:29] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: redeclaration of var length
[11:50:33] <Cork> bah
[11:50:36] <BillCriswell> There's still a lot I could use some schooling on with vanilla javascript.
[11:50:42] <Cork> man i miss defineProperty! >_>
[11:51:38] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is really useful when you want to extend objects in ways structures doesn't support
[11:52:10] <Cork> like if you want to run a function when someone want to access a value, or fake normal dom objects (like ex. localStorage)
[11:52:45] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Defining_getters_and_setters reading through this now.
[11:52:55] <BillCriswell> Just glad I don't feel lost reading through it.
[11:53:17] <jimi_> I am doing something like $('....').each(  function(element) { console.debug(element); } );   and I am getting "0" , "1", "2" instead of the actual element's info
[11:53:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: just wait until you start to look into structs :)
[11:53:38] <BillCriswell> jimi_: It's function(index, element) for the callback.
[11:54:00] <BillCriswell> or just this for the element.
[11:54:09] <Cork> BillCriswell: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:binary_data
[11:54:43] <Cork> jimi_: use this, or the second argument to the function
[11:54:49] <Cork> opps
[11:54:52] <Cork> too late :P
[11:55:21] <Xenos^> jQuery noob here, just trying to hack together something. If anyone patient would help me figure out why http://jsfiddle.net/XXHQx/1/ won't work I'd appreciate it :-)
[11:55:54] <Xenos^> The problem being that the hidden tr doesn't show up when I press the button
[11:58:09] <Cork> Xenos^: http://jsfiddle.net/XXHQx/3/
[11:58:23] <Cork> Xenos^: the html wasn't valid, and jquery wasn't loaded
[11:59:11] <Cork> also... you have html in your css secion...
[11:59:16] <Cork> *section
[11:59:27] <Xenos^> Cork: oh, ok. Thanks :-) I know it's a bit messed up atm
[12:00:49] <Cork> Xenos^: when you start develop and doens't fully know how things works, a good way to get things through smoother is to run the html through w3c's validator BEFORE you start writing the js
[12:01:18] <Xenos^> I'll remember that, thanks
[12:01:24] <kraftcc> Having trouble with jQuery UI stuff, specifically the accordion.  It doesn't size accordingly for me.
[12:01:26] <Cork> that way you don't have to bang at the js (or css), when it isn't the probelm
[12:01:45] <Cork> kraftcc: you mean it gets too big?
[12:01:51] <Cork> or what?
[12:02:12] <kraftcc> Cork: it stays the size of the largest content region
[12:02:23] <Cork> ?p
[12:02:23] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:03:33] <BillCriswell> fixee is a new one to me
[12:03:44] <kraftcc> Cork: huh?
[12:06:25] <Xal_> How can I trigger actions when certain elements are scrolled into the window?
[12:07:28] <BillCriswell> Xal_: Yes. I'd recommend the waypoints plugin.
[12:08:01] <BillCriswell> If you don't need all that checked body's scrollTop and the elements offset top on scroll should do it.
[12:08:05] <BillCriswell> I just think the plugin is nice.

[12:15:07] <madsara> Hey, anyone know how to actually make say tab 3 come to the forefront -- http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#method-enable
[12:28:04] <culh> eddiemonge: Just added another function for long pooling
[12:28:14] <culh> to my webapp
[12:33:18] <myosotis> madsara, maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/970838/selecting-loading-a-jquery-tab-programatically
[12:42:15] <spobat> where can I learn about the additional parameters I can pass to $('selector', ...) ?
[12:42:23] <spobat> I don't really know what to google for on that
[12:59:43] <anew> can i put an entire $().click( function).... inside a var?
[12:59:55] <anew> like var click = $().click()....
[13:02:35] <dabear> anew: what are you trying to do?
[13:03:53] <anew> well i have this click() that i need to use for every ajax success
[13:03:58] <anew> instead of copy/pasting it every single time
[13:04:10] <anew> can i just store it in a var, and on success{ click; }
[13:04:13] <anew> and do it that way ?
[13:04:22] <worstadmin> Im having trouble with ajax and json. When I call .ajax() its generating a request like this:  http://www.example.com/link?true=jQuery16209108856900399218_1373572995553&offerid=5087408&_=1373572997727 -Which of these is a callback?
[13:05:16] <dabear> anew: use delegated clicks
[13:06:03] <c4ptnh00k>  Can anyone tell me why my serialize methods are not working? http://jsfiddle.net/39S2e/
[13:06:11] <anew> dabear delegate() ?
[13:06:29] <dabear> anew: depends on jq version. better use on() if you can
[13:06:47] <dabear> read and understand the docs here http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:11:52] <c4ptnh00k> ?
[13:12:00] <dabear> ??
[13:12:17] <c4ptnh00k> ???
[13:14:04] <dabear> c4ptnh00k: try adding the mandatory name attribute:)
[13:14:49] <c4ptnh00k> i dont see that in the documentation :(
[13:15:14] <c4ptnh00k> nvm
[13:15:16] <c4ptnh00k> crap
[13:15:20] <dabear> c4ptnh00k: try reading the html spec
[13:15:45] <c4ptnh00k> damn me for skimming lol Thanks
[13:18:01] <c4ptnh00k> but now the inner div still does not serialize :(
[13:18:24] <c4ptnh00k> by itself
[13:21:18] <c4ptnh00k> dabear: can you look at it now? http://jsfiddle.net/39S2e/1/ the serialize all button works but not the serializeDiv http://jsfiddle.net/39S2e/2/
[13:21:52] <dabear> c4ptnh00k: gotta serialize a form
[13:22:05] <dabear> a div is no form, even if you name it "innerform" :p
[13:24:10] <dabear> c4ptnh00k: implementation-wize an html element is considered a form, if it has an elements property.
[13:24:18] <dabear> forms do, divs don't
[13:24:57] <c4ptnh00k> hmm so how would you only get the subset of elements ?
[13:25:09] <dabear> dunno
[13:25:12] <dabear> don't do it?
[13:25:22] <c4ptnh00k> have to
[13:25:25] <dabear> have two independant forms
[13:26:16] <dabear> or you could always patch the jquery source to support other elements
[13:28:24] <Skunkwaffle> Does anyone familiar with jquery mobile know how I can force a page to reload its head content?
[13:28:31] <Ose> complete noob at everything JS/jQuery: what is the correct way to ask if ( $("#cv").css("display") == "none" ), cause i'm getting false even when #cv is in fact display:none
[13:29:01] <c4ptnh00k> dabear: figured it out. look here if you want to know for future reference
[13:31:50] <anew> man i'm having trouble here... i have a window that switches back and forth with ajax calls
[13:32:02] <anew> the problem is on success i have to use another ajax call
[13:32:17] <Skunkwaffle> Ose, that should be working. Have you tried putting a breakpoint in your code to see if #cv has a display value of "none" when the code is executing?
[13:32:18] <anew> and unless i put ANOTHER ajax call inside that success
[13:32:21] <anew> the window switching stops
[13:35:16] <Ose> Skunkwaffle: I resolved it by changing the code so that I put the .toggle() bit after I checked the property, and reversed the if/else blocks. not quite sure why it didn't work though
[13:37:31] <Skunkwaffle> Hey as long as it works now..
[13:41:25] <anew> hey anyone can help me
[13:41:30] <anew> i have ajax call 1 and ajax call 2
[13:41:35] <anew> i need to do 1-2-1-2-1-2
[13:41:38] <anew> but i cant write it all out
[13:41:44] <anew> how can i just write 1-2-1 and have it work ??
[13:44:09] <Skunkwaffle> anew: are you talking about mutually recursive functions?
[13:44:21] <anew> skunkwaffle
[13:44:27] <Skunkwaffle> anew
[13:44:30] <anew> i have a popup window populated by ajax call #1
[13:44:43] <anew> in there a user clicks a link and goes to popup window 2 (ajax call #2)
[13:44:50] <anew> inside #2, the user can go back to #1
[13:45:16] <anew> to create this i had to write 1, success 2, then inside 2 success back to 1
[13:45:28] <anew> now if the user wants to go back to 2 i have to write inside that success back to 2
[13:45:32] <anew> so 1-2-1-2-1
[13:45:34] <anew> in every success
[13:45:40] <anew> this makes no sense, how can i just write it one time
[13:46:45] <anew> please jesus
[13:47:42] <Skunkwaffle> Well I'm not sure what you mean by success in this context, but if you're going to provide functionality to move between elements in two directions, you're going to need to write a way to move in either direction
[13:48:05] <Skunkwaffle> There's not much more I can tell you without looking at actual code
[13:48:47] <anew> yes, to go in either direction, i'm having to write it all out infinitely
[13:49:07] <anew> ok here is the basis of the problem -
[13:49:20] <anew> for js to work after an ajax call, i have to put the js inside the success part of the ajax call
[13:49:24] <anew> i cannot put it outside...
[13:49:29] <shoky> anew: no idea what you mean. first of all, separate the issues:  ajax is just communication between client and server, it has nothing to do with any window or popup
[13:49:40] <anew> shoky obviously
[13:49:48] <anew> who is even talking about that
[13:49:56] <anew> i'm talking about on success i need to run more js
[13:49:56] <shoky> you
[13:49:59] <anew> no i'm not
[13:50:07] <anew> on success i have to run more js
[13:50:29] <anew> if i place the js outside the success it wont work, so to go back and forth between windows i'm just having to keep writing more succeses with more js
[13:51:50] <vivified> hey all, anyone here use teamtreehouse? i somehow lost 1 video; trying to see if i can get from anyone who's has an acct
[13:52:05] <shoky> anew: show code. otherwise it's just mumbo jumbo
[13:54:32] <grafi> i never thought of mumbo jumbo as bad :o
[13:55:00] <shoky> mumbo jumbo isn't bad. it's just meaningless
[13:55:13] <grafi> i see
[13:55:15] <grafi> :P
[13:58:24] <vivified> hey all, anyone here use treehouse?
[13:58:36] <BillCriswell> I used to... for private reasons.
[13:59:32] <vivified> BillCriswell: as in teamtreehouse? i somehow lost 1 video i'm trying to see if anyone can share with me
[13:59:59] <BillCriswell> vivified: Ahhh, I'm not sure.
[14:00:16] <vivified> BillCriswell: you no longer have a subscription then?
[14:00:29] <BillCriswell> I do not.
[14:00:35] <anew> look if you're hiding and showing a div with ajax, that 'new' div which appears i cannot bind js to it
[14:01:24] <BillCriswell> anew: You're creating a new div or showing a hidden one?
[14:01:36] <anew> billcriswell i'm using display:none
[14:01:38] <anew> and then show()
[14:02:07] <BillCriswell> anew: You should be able to bind events to that no problem.
[14:02:54] <anew> argh... the only way i can bind an event to is, is if i put the js specifically in the success part of the ajax (along with .show) if i put the js in the header of the page it doesnt work
[14:03:31] <BillCriswell> anew: How are you selecting the element?
[14:03:47] <anew> billcriswell what i am trying to bind is being created with .html() and i am using templates
[14:04:30] <BillCriswell> So you're creating the div you're trying to add events to using javascript?
[14:05:20] <anew> yes
[14:06:18] <anew> hmmm the template could be the problem then because it is not showing until i use .html() ?
[14:06:26] <BillCriswell> ok, do you can do var $div = $('<div>New Content</div>'); $div.on('click', function(){ alert('Yoooooo'); }); $('body').append($div); and you should be OK.
[14:07:11] <anew> let me try that
[14:08:54] <anew> let me fiddle
[14:09:03] <anew> the problem is i have a template inside <script></script> tags
[14:09:04] <BillCriswell> ok
[14:09:15] <anew> and i guess the template will not load on page load
[14:09:18] <anew> so nothing gets bound to it
[14:09:47] <BillCriswell> anew: Hmm...You shouldn't be applying events to a template, just what's rendered from the template.
[14:09:53] <BillCriswell> Hopefully I explained that right?
[14:09:57] <anew> what do u mean
[14:10:03] <anew> i cant do .click on a template ?
[14:10:18] <shoky> you got it
[14:10:50] <anew> hmmm
[14:10:52] <shoky> you might also wanna check out event delegation
[14:11:02] <anew> so how the hell can i do .click on a template? i need to click something on it
[14:11:18] <shoky> you can only click on elements in the DOM
[14:11:25] <shoky> not templates
[14:11:48] <anew> but i'm creating <li> with json
[14:11:49] <BillCriswell> anew: You'd can do like... var $element = $(template.render( templateString, data )); POSSIBLY
[14:12:01] <anew> let me show u the fiddle almost done
[14:12:11] <BillCriswell> templateLibrary.render() *
[14:14:21] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/MEmJ3/
[14:14:25] <anew> billcriswell
[14:14:37] <anew> so the click on the bottom is bound to what is inside the <script> tags above
[14:14:41] <anew> but it won't work...
[14:15:01] <anew> that is because it is inside the template.. .but how can i get js to the state-selects class
[14:15:31] <BillCriswell> anew: You have to render the template, which will give you HTML, then you do what you want with that.
[14:16:00] <BillCriswell> What template language are you using?
[14:16:04] <anew> underscore
[14:16:05] <BillCriswell> well.. library
[14:16:13] <BillCriswell> Terrible wording.
[14:16:14] <BillCriswell> Ok
[14:16:20] <anew> the template renders... the text appears etc...
[14:16:27] <anew> but nothing works after that
[14:18:01] <anew> billcriswell any ideas
[14:18:02] <anew> or shoky
[14:20:41] <vivified> hey all, anyone here currently using teamtreehouse?
[14:20:56] <shoky> anew: you can do what BillCriswell told you.  var elem = $( _.template(...) );  $('#loop').html( elem );  elem.find('whatever').click(function() {... } )
[14:21:08] <shoky> anew: but the better solution would probably event delegation
[14:21:15] <shoky> probably be*
[14:21:39] <shoky> donno what elements you want the click on tho
[14:22:51] <anew> you mean the click that renders the template ?
[14:23:19] <shoky> stop mixing up terms
[14:23:26] <shoky> clicks dont render templates
[14:24:15] <shoky> i donno what you want, anew
[14:24:31] <anew> just use .on() you mean ?
[14:24:54] <shoky> no
[14:25:32] <shoky> by event delegation i meant to use .on() with event delegation. not just use .on()
[14:27:32] <anew> just changed it to .on()
[14:28:18] <anew> u mean to use .delegate() also
[14:31:14] <anew> no, and put the child in there
[14:31:15] <anew> doesnt work
[14:31:19] <anew> it's something to do with the templates
[14:32:37] <anew> if the parent is dynamically created it wont work
[14:33:29] <shoky> i meant something like  $('#loop').on('click', '.state-selects', function(e) {...})
[14:33:38] <shoky> assuming #loop already exists
[14:33:57] <shoky> .delegate is just a shortcut to .on  btw
[14:34:33] <shoky> and assuming you want to handle clicks on the .state-selects elements
[14:34:46] <anew> yeah that's exactly what i wrote
[14:34:48] <anew> still didnt work
[14:35:04] <shoky> ok well. my food is here, so good luck for now ;p
[14:35:09] <anew> well i didnt do #loop
[14:35:18] <anew> damnit
[14:37:18] <BillCriswell> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/46uXc/
[14:38:55] <BillCriswell> This shows how you could with event delegation: http://jsfiddle.net/46uXc/1/
[14:39:32] <anew> oh ssweet let me look
[14:40:34] <majuscule> How can I change the :hover css attribute of an element?
[14:40:53] <BillCriswell> majuscule: You'd have to add a class that alters it I think.
[14:40:53] <anew> hmmm let me try this
[14:41:10] <BillCriswell> Not sure you can edit hover state directly?
[14:42:30] <BillCriswell> anew: If you're adding <li>s to a list in the HTML already you'd be better off doing $('#some-list').on('click', 'li', stuff );
[14:44:42] <anew_> i got disconnected
[14:44:44] <anew_> did u write anything
[14:44:55] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[14:45:01] <BillCriswell> I'm actually heading home.
[14:45:09] <anew_> damn ok that helped a lot tho
[14:45:11] <anew_> i'm on track
[14:45:12] <anew_> thanks a lot
[14:45:15] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[14:49:07] <majuscule> BillTheButcher: yeah looks like that's the only way. was hoping i was missing something. thanaks though :-)
[15:05:15] <eyeseye_> how do i use jQuery.html(), but with the return data not escaped?
[15:46:46] <delinquentme> say I make an ajax post ... What part of the interaction determines that the POST is a success as jquery is concerned?
[15:46:54] <delinquentme> if it resolves @ 200?
[15:51:58] <delinquentme> print '{"success":"true"}'
[16:11:11] <anew_> i'm using ajax to keep repopulating a template, problem is .val() is always coming up the first value, when it shoud be getting overwritten each time
[16:11:12] <anew_> what do
[16:30:04] <Ose> so i'm getting a bit weird behavour, and I think it is because i'm using timed transitions (i.e. a two second fading) and the function I want to run *after* the transition runs *while* the transition is still going. I see it is possible to pass a function as an argument to run after the transition, but that creates lots of nestings that aren't very pretty in my opinion. is there a better way...
[16:30:05] <Ose> ...to handle this?
[16:31:02] <Ose> i'm mostly used to programming Java with only a single thread at any time :)
[16:31:34] <grafi> ugh threads
[16:32:27] <grafi> http://darcyclarke.me/development/using-jquery-deferreds-with-animations/ maybe this will help you
[16:33:08] <grafi> also: http://jsfiddle.net/m67Ua/
[16:33:27] <Ose> brilliant
[16:35:58] <josher> I've got a question for some more experienced developers in here. I've been told contributing to open source projects look good on the resume. I'd love to contribute to jQuery but I'm thrown off on how to start. Do you just pick a bug and work it?
[16:41:12] <shoky> josher: you can try that, sure.. take a look at http://contribute.jquery.org for some info
[16:41:49] <iggy> josher: it might help if you don't think of jquery as something special... it's just another open source project... there are probably millions of bits of info on the google about contributing to open source projects
[16:42:33] <iggy> as to whether it's actually beneficial to do so, that depends on what you want to do
[17:00:11] <QuanSai> Can someone check out my problem here?  Scrolling won't work.  No errors in the console.  Problem explained here: http://pastebin.com/um0UZLsG
[17:05:21] <josher> shoky & iggy: thanks!
[17:07:05] <asidjazz> JS hacking time
[17:07:13] <asidjazz> how do i call a function thats name is a variable
[17:07:28] <asidjazz> ohya
[17:07:29] <asidjazz> window
[17:07:57] <Ansikt> You mean, like with eval or something?
[17:09:21] <Ansikt> like function myFunction(){/*do stuff here*/}; var functionName = 'myFunction()'; eval(functionName);
[17:11:04] <Ansikt> alternatively, you could do it with the bracketed object notation
[17:20:13] <QuanSai> Can someone check out my problem here?  Scrolling won't work.  No errors in the console.  Problem explained here: http://pastebin.com/um0UZLsG
[17:22:40] <oojacoboo> how can I disable an anchor?
[17:23:03] <oojacoboo> event.preventDefault onClick isn't going to cut it either b/c I have click events bound that need to fire
[17:23:17] <oojacoboo> and I need an on/off scenario for the disabled prop
[17:23:40] <oojacoboo> disabled prop doesn't work though for other onClick registered event handlers
[17:24:00] <oojacoboo> so I guess, is there anyway to disable those event handlers temporarily
[17:24:17] <oojacoboo> without having to re-register them
[17:33:04] <nesoi> helloâ¦ what's the correct or best way to: a) remove the contents of a div (but not the div) b) clear a textarea?
[17:33:26] <oojacoboo> nesoi: $("div").html("");
[17:33:40] <nesoi> so not .empty
[17:33:48] <oojacoboo> $("textarea").prop("value", "");
[17:33:54] <oojacoboo> nesoi: empty() works too :)
[17:34:08] <nesoi> .empty() isn't working. Do I have to refresh the div?
[17:34:12] <oojacoboo> no
[17:34:42] <nesoi> so what would make it not work?
[17:35:08] <oojacoboo> nesoi: testcase
[17:35:11] <nesoi> I'm using JQMâ¦ trying to clear out a page that's not currently loaded
[17:36:05] <nesoi> would that make it not work?
[17:36:16] <nesoi> well, it's loaded but not current
[17:36:27] <oojacoboo> .testcase @ nesoi
[17:36:27] <b-ot> nesoi: see: minimal
[17:36:33] <oojacoboo> .minimal @ nesoi
[17:36:33] <b-ot> nesoi: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[17:36:55] <oojacoboo> jsfiddle.net
[17:37:46] <nesoi> that would take me a long time to create, since it's jqm with multiple pages. I wonder if anyone knows the answer to the general question of whether a jqm page has to be current for empty() to work
[17:37:55] <nesoi> I previously found I had to use refresh to make it work
[17:38:24] <nesoi> ie: I had to do:    $('#contactList').empty(); $('#contactList').listview("refresh");
[17:38:39] <nesoi> so I was wondering if there's an equivalent refresh for other types of divs I could use
[17:38:46] <oojacoboo> nesoi: JQM isn't your issue
[17:38:55] <oojacoboo> it's prob something simple
[17:38:59] <oojacoboo> I can't help you though without code
[17:39:08] <BillCriswell> nesoi: $('div').html('') and $('textarea').val('') should do the trick.
[17:39:24] <nesoi> ok thanks, I'll test that
[17:39:31] <oojacoboo> lol
[17:39:48] <BillCriswell> $('div').empty() should definitley work though.
[17:39:56] <BillCriswell> definitely*
[17:40:45] <nesoi> that worked
[17:41:02] <nesoi> but I put the changepage after the empty
[17:41:05] <nesoi> odd
[17:41:35] <nesoi> it didn't look bad so I'll leave it that way. It may be that with jqm it won't work properly on a non-current page
[17:43:01] <nesoi> I would have thought you could update pages which haven't been loaded, since the entire set of pages is in one DOM
[17:53:07] <nesoi> is there any significant reason to do something like $(document).on('pagechange', function(event) { and then have separate code for each page you want to do something on, rather than $(document).on("pagechange", "#somePage", function() { ?
[17:56:04] <oojacoboo> nesoi: html5 has an api for this
[17:56:29] <oojacoboo> also, there is a jq plugin as well called bahashchange event
[17:57:07] <oojacoboo> waitâ¦ what's "pagechange" ?
[17:57:16] <oojacoboo> is that literally a DOM element you added?
[17:57:24] <oojacoboo> or a custom event rather, sorry
[18:04:48] <nesoi> it's jquery mobile
[18:06:21] <Guest74771> I have to make a page that pulls data from a MySQL DB and shows in a HTML table, Orignally i wanted to use a Jquery plugin because of all the fetures i need (Sort by select column, Search by, Mass select/edit with check boxes, Ect like flexigrid.info) i couldnt find any plugin that was simple to implement though so now im looking for a PHP script that will print the DB in html and let me Sort by colum
[18:06:21] <Guest74771> ns, Search by order ID, Select all, and edit selected) or a simple to implement Jquery/Ajax plugin that i could use?
[18:12:30] <funhouse> Hey there does anyone use the Keith Wood countdown plugin?
[18:59:33] <duruD> hello.

[19:09:58] <abjorn> ic
[19:10:38] <abjorn> but yeah, if you have questions about jquery duruD, there are plenty of people that can help
[19:11:08] <abjorn> in other news, this scotch is really good mmm
[19:11:27] <leo_31> great!
[19:11:53] <leo_31> have you been fired ?
[19:12:03] <abjorn> no, no i have not
[19:12:17] <leo_31> you must be a good employee
[19:12:32] <abjorn> i guess so
[19:12:52] <leo_31> i was fired recently (as in terminated from a job). why did the boss ask me if i expected it and why does he and my colleagues still have me on skype?
[19:13:01] <abjorn> i suppose it helps that i only worked one place before the place i work now
[19:13:05] <abjorn> before that i was freelance
[19:13:22] <leo_31> how old are you?
[19:13:27] <abjorn> 22
[19:13:30] <leo_31> ok
[19:14:03] <leo_31> i think at somepoint you will get fired
[19:14:10] <abjorn> happens to everyone
[19:14:58] <leo_31> how should you act at the firing meeting?
[19:15:25] <abjorn> i dont know try #jobadvice
[19:16:04] <leo_31> nobody there
[19:16:15] <abjorn> i figured, it was a joke
[19:16:48] <leo_31> sorry i am not very clever. maybe thats why i was fired hahaha
[19:18:18] <shoky> leo_31 stop obsessing over it
[19:24:31] <oojacoboo> leo_31: you should probably ask why you're being fired
[19:24:41] <oojacoboo> and then dig for the real reason if you can get it
[19:24:51] <oojacoboo> you can't fix what you don't know is broken
[19:24:54] <leo_31> they wont tell you
[19:26:57] <abjorn> sue them for all they're worth! (disclaimer: I do not give sound legal advice)
[19:28:07] <leo_31> the asshole aksed if i was expecting it
[19:28:33] <oojacoboo> you prob weren't doing your job as they saw it, I guess
[19:28:35] <oojacoboo> aka, slacking
[19:31:09] <expondo> oyu guys, I've a pretty photo galery, but I can put more images, example in the fourth square, bodybuilding, how do I insert more images to that gallery ?? please

[19:37:01] <icedwater> So, if I already have jquery.js included in the <head>, should I be using $() in place of document.getElementById() everywhere?
[19:37:32] <shoky> icedwater: if you wanna type less, sure. note that it's not a drop-in replacement though
[19:38:12] <icedwater> Yeah, I was wondering, because I was going to shift some code into an external .js and it didn't look like it would work.
[19:39:12] <shoky> try learning jquery
[19:39:23] <icedwater> Heh, thanks.
[19:39:51] <icedwater> I will at some point, the thing is I'm trying to dump some cleaned code out into a file and I remembered $().

[20:24:28] <carpii> anyone looking for a few hours node.js/jQuery work a week? Ive just listed a job on reddit.. http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1i4ohp/hiring_experienced_nodejs_and_jquery_for_adhoc/
[20:47:37] <molavy> hi
[20:48:01] <molavy> i want find words contains a string
[20:48:11] <molavy> what is problem of this line
[20:48:11] <molavy> string.replace(new RegExp('(?:\s|^)(.*'+query+'.*)(?:\s|$)'), function($1,match) {return '<strong>'+match+'</strong>'})
[20:49:17] <carpii> in what way isnt it working ?
[20:50:22] <molavy> above line select whole sentence
[20:51:24] <molavy> if query exist in sentence above line strong whole sentence
[20:51:25] <carpii> youd be better off pasting the actual line youre running, after explanding 'query'
[20:51:32] <carpii> else its meaningless to everyone
[20:51:45] <carpii> there could be anything in query for all we know
[20:52:41] <molavy> query="def";
[20:52:59] <molavy> "abc def ghi".replace(new RegExp(...
[20:59:00] <molavy> carpii, any idea?
[21:00:46] <carpii> not really, seems like a flawed reg exp more than a code problem
[21:19:08] <molavy> i want find words contains a string
[21:19:45] <carpii> molavy: do you really need a regular expression if you just want to locate a substring?
[21:20:03] <carpii> why not just "abc def efg".indexOf("def") ?
[21:20:50] <molavy> carpii that show return def in "abc def efg".indexOf("d")
[21:21:03] <carpii> what?
[21:21:36] <molavy> i want word that contain query string
[21:22:21] <carpii> ok, so if string is "abc   xxxdefxxx ghi" and you look for def
[21:22:29] <carpii> you want to actually find the word xxxdefxxx
[21:22:46] <molavy> no ,that should return xxxdefxxx
[21:23:04] <carpii> so why not use indexOf, and then backtrack to find the previous space ?
[21:24:55] <carpii> molavy: try http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html
[21:25:01] <carpii> regexp: \s(.*def[^ |$]*).*$
[21:25:07] <carpii> subject string: abc xxxdefxxx ghi
[21:25:12] <carpii> click show match
[21:25:46] <carpii> not syaing its perfect but its a start :p
[21:31:04] <molavy> carpii that don't work for first word
[21:31:44] <molavy> carpii. i think i should use index of
[21:32:13] <carpii> yeah maybe
[21:32:30] <carpii> unless your query term includes regular expression things, its probably better just to fall back to string funcs
[21:52:28] <LoneSoldier728> hey guys
[21:59:46] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here?
[23:22:18] <EvilNo0B> Hello , please can someone explain why validation doesnt work right ? if (a<"6") {alert("Title must contain more than 6 characters");return false;}
[23:22:18] <EvilNo0B> The previous validation works though ( pretty much the same - (a==null || a=="") though that only checks if the field is filled :((( )
[23:24:45] <Woet> EvilNo0B: a.length < 6
[23:25:03] <Woet> EvilNo0B: you want to check whether the length is less than 6, not the actual object
[23:25:18] <EvilNo0B> Woet , thank you :D!
[23:27:50] <EvilNo0B> Woet, a question , javascript validation isnt always working right ? so better to also have a php validation function for "just in case" right?
[23:28:51] <Cork> EvilNo0B: you should never depends on js for securing your data; so yes you SHOULD have php validating the data
[23:29:01] <Cork> have js, for rappid response
[23:31:21] <EvilNo0B> Cork, yeah ofc , im just making sure :D thats what i thought:P so pretty much the js scripts are just for beauty and less messy site use :)
[23:32:22] <bleedingmonk> hey anyone familiar with twitter typeahead?
[23:39:51] <Woet> EvilNo0B: as Cork said, JS validation purely for user friendliness, backend (e.g. PHP) for actual validation
