[01:59:52] <Cork> Andr3as: (Number(n.Maximum) == undefined won't ever be true
[02:00:15] <Cork> you want n.Maximum == undefined or isNaN(Number(n.Maximum))
[02:17:42] <aro> when using draggable, is there a way to get the id or element of the target list?
[02:22:19] <SimpleName> how to select id starts with “love_
[02:22:58] <aro> $('[id^='love_"
[02:23:04] <aro> $('[id^="love_"]')
[02:23:20] <aro> i think
[02:23:50] <whirled> how do you insert an option into a select so that it is the second-to-last option?
[02:25:55] <aro> whirled: $('select option').eq($('select option').length).before($('<option></option>').val(value).text('textnode'));
[02:26:00] <aro> something like that
[02:26:08] <aro> although
[02:26:12] <aro> id use this
[02:26:26] <aro> whirled: $('select option').eq($('#idOfYourList option').length).before($('<option></option>').val(value).text('textnode'));
[02:28:46] <aro> sorry
[02:28:50] <aro> whirled: $('select option').eq($('#idOfYourList option').length - 1).before($('<option></option>').val(value).text('textnode'));
[02:28:54] <aro> you need that - 1 in there
[02:29:10] <aro> pen: http://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/bqdqWw
[02:37:38] <whirled> $("<option class='newOption'>"+newVal+"</option>").insertBefore ($("select option").last());
[02:38:19] <whirled> but I can't get $("select options").filter(":selected") to work without jslint complaining
[02:38:37] <whirled> options/ option
[02:51:22] <whirled> I have four four options. none of which have a class defined on them. So $("select option").filter(".custom_class") should return 0 elements, but it returns 4
[02:53:55] <whirled> http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/dvoOVp?editors=0011
[02:54:46] <whirled> if you select other from the list, it should find exactly 0 options of class 'other_opt' , but it keeps finding all of the options.
[02:56:32] <whirled> without changing anything, it is now working...I think codepen's updates are causing problems.
[04:05:32] <must_know> hello , i have a problem , collecting data from instagram api with jsonp, can anyone help ?
[04:08:46] <must_know> https://jsfiddle.net/vcdfohL6/2/ can anyone help me on jsonp data handling ?
[04:19:10] <OnceMe> I have a string and I want to turn any occurence in that string to the clickable url, so basically each occurence of http/https/www should be changed to <a href="http://thatlink">http://thatlink</a>, how to accomplish this? Or there is already some snippet/plugin for this?
[04:24:07] <mikunos> hi guys I don't understand how have I to autoselect the credit card type using this js snippet  code found on the web: https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/t0v20hf5/4/
[04:27:40] <anli_> I have a div that I can see, it occupies space, still .is(':visible') returns false
[04:29:14] <Woet> OnceMe: what did you googel for so far?
[04:29:30] <Woet> google *
[04:29:31] <Woet> anli_: jsfiddle.net
[04:29:40] <anli_> yeah
[04:29:42] <Woet> must_know: what is your question?
[04:30:42] <Woet> mikunos: check the console, please make a working demo.
[04:30:59] <must_know> Woet , its seems that i cannot handle some JSON data , using JSON.prase();
[04:31:11] <mikunos> Woet the working demo?
[04:31:27] <must_know> Woet so i posted it in https://jsfiddle.net/vcdfohL6/2/
[04:31:56] <Woet> mikunos: yes, please turn your jsfiddle into a working demo.
[04:32:34] <Woet> must_know: did you check the console?
[04:32:35] <mikunos> Woet If I know the solution ....
[04:32:48] <Woet> mikunos: did you even look at the console? you havent even loaded jquery.
[04:33:09] <OnceMe> Woet: I use anchorme, but it have problems with escapeHtml() function
[04:33:27] <anli_> jsfiddle should include twitter bootstrap...
[04:34:01] <mikunos> how have I to include it?
[04:34:02] <Woet> anli_: you can add any external requests yourself
[04:34:05] <Woet> OnceMe: so what is your question?
[04:34:12] <anli_> yeah, meaning its not included, but ok
[04:34:16] <anli_> :)
[04:34:18] <Woet> mikunos: external resources
[04:34:26] <Woet> anli_: correct, not even jquery is.
[04:34:33] <must_know> woet , anyhelp please ?
[04:34:40] <anli_> Woet: it is
[04:34:42] <Woet> [10:32:36]  <Woet>	must_know: did you check the console?
[04:35:04] <Woet> anli_: as you can see in https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/t0v20hf5/4/ - no, it isn't
[04:35:08] <must_know> Woet , no , i dont know how too :P. developer tools?
[04:35:17] <Woet> must_know: what did you google for so far?
[04:35:46] <anli_> Woet: http://imgur.com/a/nV0to
[04:35:47] <Woet> must_know: "<your browser> console" should tell you
[04:36:00] <must_know> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0
[04:36:02] <Woet> anli_: okay, so you mean it's not included in the preset.
[04:36:06] <Woet> must_know: there you go.
[04:36:09] <anli_> Woet: yes
[04:36:12] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/t0v20hf5/5/
[04:36:38] <Woet> mikunos: check the console again
[04:37:03] <mikunos> TypeError: $(...).bind is not a function
[04:38:20] <Woet> mikunos: http://api.jquery.com/bind/ - "As of jQuery 3.0, .bind() has been deprecated. It was superseded by the .on() method for attaching event handlers to a document since jQuery 1.7, so its use was already discouraged."
[04:39:41] <must_know> Woet , am tracking the string , witch it doesnt make sense to me , why there is no response.data
[04:40:07] <anli_> Woet: It seems I used is on the wrong element in the hierarchy, tada
[04:40:20] <Woet> anli_: see, even found out without sharing the jsfiddle.
[04:40:28] <anli_> hehe
[04:40:50] <anli_> I did not sort out that solution candidate either
[04:40:59] <Woet> anli_: thats why you turn it into test cases
[04:41:08] <anli_> yes
[04:41:09] <Woet> must_know: did you check what response contains?
[04:41:48] <mikunos> thanks guys
[04:42:44] <must_know> woet , its says undefiend
[04:43:09] <Woet> must_know: use console.log on "response"
[04:45:20] <must_know> sadly , still undefined :
[04:45:20] <must_know> VM1635:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0success @ VM1483:67fire @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:3305fireWith @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:3435done @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:9242callback @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:9609dispatch @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:5201elemData.handle @ VM1437 jquery-3.1.1.js:5009
[04:46:09] <Woet> must_know: nope, console.log returns an object.
[04:46:17] <Woet> must_know: into your console.
[04:47:25] <must_know> yeah am reading it now.
[04:59:12] <OnceMe> Woet: check this https://jsfiddle.net/zwm1u759/
[04:59:25] <OnceMe> and then this https://jsfiddle.net/zwm1u759/1/
[04:59:54] <OnceMe> so for www it works, but for https:// it doesnt.. anchorme() converts text to url fine, without escapeHtml(), but when I use that function, I encounter errors
[05:00:57] <Woet> OnceMe: did you check what escapeHtml does?
[05:01:15] <OnceMe> I did and the problem is in it
[05:01:24] <OnceMe> but if I don't use escapeHtml() I will be vuln to xss
[05:01:49] <OnceMe> so I want to use escapeHtml() to avoid xss, and to convert string to url
[05:02:33] <OnceMe> problem is with this "/": '&#x2F;'
[05:02:36] <Woet> OnceMe: yes, I get that. your escapeHtml function is bad.
[05:02:46] <OnceMe> how would you improve it?
[05:02:57] <Woet> OnceMe: why is it escaping /?
[05:03:14] <Cork> OnceMe: i wouldn't trust xss to prevent injection if i where you
[05:03:28] <Cork> uh... trust regex to prevent xss i i where you i meant :)
[05:03:51] <OnceMe> well, because I want to ensure / is really / in html and not something else
[05:03:55] <Cork> you could use csp to block inline js though
[05:04:03] <OnceMe> but I guess I can get rid of that?
[05:04:13] <OnceMe> Cork: what do you mean by "i wouldn't trust xss to prevent injection if i where you "
[05:04:23] <Cork> OnceMe: check the correction on the next line
[05:04:45] <OnceMe> so, how to prevent xss then?
[05:04:49] <OnceMe> and how to make anchorme() works?
[05:05:07] <Cork> i would prob use csp and forbid inline js all together
[05:05:25] <Cork> then you have solved about 90% of xss
[05:05:50] <Cork> though you will have to design the page to work without inline js, and that can be a tough trip if you haven't done it before
[05:05:58] <Woet> OnceMe: how do you mean, / is really /
[05:06:12] <Cork> Woet: he escape / in urls
[05:06:25] <Woet> OnceMe: theres a reason if you google for "javascript escape html" none of the functions provided escape /
[05:06:28] <Cork> / => &#x2F;
[05:06:44] <Cork> though i'm not sure why you do that, / isn't a special character in html
[05:06:49] <Woet> Cork: yes, I get that. what does that have to do with XSS?
[05:07:02] <Cork> nothing, i don't see the point in doing it at all
[05:07:09] <OnceMe> I used this http://stackoverflow.com/a/12034334/4039826
[05:07:10] <Woet> exactly
[05:07:23] <Cork> also escaping " and ' is questionable for the same reason
[05:07:44] <Woet> OnceMe: if you'd read the comments, you'd see "Why encode / at all? It's not needed."
[05:07:50] <Woet> OnceMe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html
[05:07:52] <Cork> the only escape from that function that really matters is the < and >
[05:08:04] <OnceMe> I removed / from entityMap, but I get undefined now https://jsfiddle.net/zwm1u759/2/
[05:08:32] <Woet> OnceMe: because its still in your regex..
[05:08:32] <Cork> OnceMe: you have to remove it from the regex too
[05:08:47] <Cork> OnceMe: https://jsfiddle.net/zwm1u759/3/
[05:08:56] <Woet> OnceMe: also, this is gonna break ?foo&bar in your URLs as well
[05:09:10] <Woet> OnceMe: just stick to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html
[05:09:16] <OnceMe> so, I should be fine with removing / right?
[05:09:18] <Cork> OnceMe: and one that does what you need https://jsfiddle.net/zwm1u759/4/
[05:09:28] <Cork> OnceMe: all you need is the <> escape
[05:09:37] <Cork> the rest is for valid html, not for xss
[05:10:22] <Cork> cause if they can't define tags, they can't invoice browser actions
[05:10:50] <OnceMe> ok thanks!
[05:10:55] <Cork> (i would still make sure to use csp for the site if you case about xss though)
[05:10:56] <Krisostoomus> hei, kas siin eestlasi on?
[05:11:05] <Cork> Krisostoomus: english please
[05:11:24] <Cork> OnceMe: i recommend reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
[05:15:19] <Woet> it confuses me so much when people enter English channels/communities/forums and just start speaking their own language
[05:15:42] <Woet> at least use English for your "are there any Estonians here?"
[05:16:14] <Cork> well there are quite few ppl that don't know english
[05:17:00] <Cork> and it is actually quite common in eastern europe, so...
[05:17:02] <Woet> there are countries where primary schools dont teach English?
[05:17:17] <Cork> heh see answer i just gave :D
[05:17:52] <Woet> interesting
[05:18:00] <Cork> fresh know it, but really REALLY don't want to use it, so you can get them sometimes
[05:18:21] <Cork> but old soviet countries often really don't know it at all
[05:18:34] <Cork> (some use google translate to try to solve that, to a horrible effect)
[08:25:01] <dglambert> morning
[09:06:28] <laravelnewbie2> hi
[09:54:18] <ZoderUck> hello i have a bit problem with the size of  owl carousel.js   where am i able to  change the width ?
[11:33:02] <Juinn> hey guys can someone help me on how i could do this
[11:33:03] <Juinn> https://jsfiddle.net/euxqjeds/
[11:33:19] <Juinn> i want to be able to store .html() changes and then call them in loop when needed...
[11:34:27] <taplar> i don't believe html() returns html
[11:34:33] <taplar> if you pass it a value that is
[11:35:05] <taplar> yeah, it returns the object you called html(value) on
[11:35:07] <Juinn> .html() will change html for a selector?..what i want to do is hold those functions in an array then call when needed
[11:35:43] <taplar> i'm not sure i understand what you are after
[11:35:52] <taplar> 'those functions' ?
[11:36:38] <Juinn> sorry may have missed out an important part :) https://jsfiddle.net/euxqjeds/1/
[11:36:53] <Juinn> sorry https://jsfiddle.net/euxqjeds/2/
[11:37:45] <taplar> line 3 is actually applying the value to the $td.  the $td is being pushed into the array
[11:38:20] <Juinn> yeah i dont want it to apply the value at that stage
[11:38:25] <Juinn> but in a loop instead
[11:38:32] <taplar> why?
[11:38:32] <Juinn> so i can call it after
[11:39:12] <taplar> you don't want to incrementally apply changes if you can do them all at once.  every dom change causes the browser to do a redraw, typically, or in the least a reflow
[11:39:26] <taplar> it is in your best interest to apply all changes at a given time if possible
[11:42:10] <Juinn> i want to change values depending on callback return
[11:42:21] <Juinn> if callback = true apply changes
[11:42:58] <taplar> can you make the fiddle reflect the actual situation then?
[11:44:45] <Juinn> yes bear with me
[11:44:48] <Juinn> ty
[12:29:58] <taplar> sleepy monday
[12:32:38] <Juinn> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/wdtLxbvp/1/   line 64  will delete if callback not false...line 92 is where i want to hold back all the .html() changes
[12:36:35] <taplar> so it looks like you are pushing the changes to the data.  though line 87 is making the change to the td
[12:38:43] <Juinn> those changes are catching id, name, phone_number...so it can be updated in database
[12:39:13] <Juinn> but line 92 takes the input value and puts in td
[12:39:21] <Juinn> i only want this to be possible if callback is not false
[12:39:57] <taplar> so, you need to call the callback before then, no?
[12:40:42] <taplar> or build some object to carry around
[12:41:05] <taplar> var updates = [];  updates.push({element: $td, newValue: value});
[12:41:19] <taplar> then if true loop through that array and apply the changes
[12:43:11] <Juinn> roger that...thank you :)
[12:46:28] <Dirkos> Im looking for a plugin to emulate the "password" field
[12:46:46] <Dirkos> Problem is that the password field keeps prompting the password manager in chrome and i just want the field to be hidden
[12:48:33] <taplar> you mean it's autocompleting and you don't want it to autocomplete?
[12:48:33] <duch_kazatel> why do you have a hidden password field in the first place
[12:50:40] <robertmaxrees> taplar autocomplete and password managers are usually separate in most breowsers.
[12:51:04] <taplar> hmm
[12:51:33] <taplar> just curious cause i saw some S.O. posts saying chrome started ignoring autocomplete="off" unless it was on the <form>
[12:51:50] <Dirkos> taplar: indeed
[12:52:05] <Dirkos> thats why i now keep that irritating popup all the time which my customer is declining
[12:52:26] <Dirkos> The thing is that customers are using the form in a retail show where they have to enter there net income.
[12:52:37] <Dirkos> And they dont want that the shop employee can see it directly
[12:52:53] <Dirkos> So im looking for a way to hide it. Therefor i picked it as a password field which is now not working
[12:55:11] <taplar> mask input has a few results in the google
[12:55:20] <taplar> i suppose you could also put an overlay over the input
[12:55:59] <taplar> though if it is for a retail show, why does the data they put in have to be accurate?
[12:56:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:56:32] <Dirkos> taplar: its not for show
[12:56:48] <taplar> "The thing is that customers are using the form in a retail show where they have to enter there net income. "
[12:56:53] <Dirkos> Its restricted data from the customer which they dont want the employee which is helping them is showing
[12:57:01] <Dirkos> meant retail "shop"
[12:57:02] <Dirkos> sorry
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> so this isn't for the general web, this is for a select few machines?
[12:57:35] <Dirkos> So we have 1 employee of the shop who is requesting the data but he should not see the data itself. The guest should enter it and therefor a sort of "password" type field
[12:57:50] <Dirkos> robertmaxrees: well its a web app, but not an open website indeed
[12:58:11] <taplar> he's requesting something he cannot see?
[12:58:15] <taplar> that's odd
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> taplar probably for analytics later on.
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> not the employee but the customer.
[12:58:39] <Dirkos> No, its NET income and i guess you dont want to share yours with someone you dont know
[12:58:59] <Dirkos> its needed since you will be buying a subscription which has a loan at the end
[12:59:06] <Dirkos> So there will be a register check at the backend services
[12:59:38] <taplar> so some dude is filling out a form for someone, and they need to enter in the income, so they'll hand the keyboard over to them to enter that part in, and then it will go back to the other guy
[12:59:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the IT department needs to hit the site once on each machine they provision and hit the "never" button once.
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, could munge around with the different inputs on form submit and copy that data to a hidden field and disable that password field.
[13:00:46] <taplar> or maybe make it a modal entry that closes after entered
[13:00:56] <Dirkos> taplar: that last one could work
[13:01:04] <Dirkos> but still you will have the fields you input there
[13:01:10] <robertmaxrees> seems odd for a single field.
[13:01:10] <Dirkos> thats why i wanted a "password" type field
[13:01:16] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/27072657
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> the copy/disbale thing is probably your best bet imo.
[13:03:42] <MikeD_> so you want the customer to enter information that the person standing next to them isn't supposed to know?
[13:04:16] <MikeD_> i can simply watch what keys you hit on the keyboard even if it's a password field on screen
[13:05:06] <Dirkos> MikeD_: totally agree but that is not how business people think sorry
[13:05:10] <Dirkos> robertmaxrees: thanks
[13:05:27] <MikeD_> "how business people think" - haha
[13:05:49] <robertmaxrees> Dirkos just for context: these people are applying for some kind of loan but don't want their annual income exposed.  that seems super weird.
[13:06:25] <sine0> is there a way to encrypt a javascript program thats in a web browser
[13:06:30] <Dirkos> not exposed to just a shop employee :)
[13:06:44] <taplar> sine0: what do you mean?
[13:06:57] <MikeD_> sine0: the short answer is no.
[13:07:13] <MikeD_> the long answer is mostly just the backstory for why the short answer is no
[13:07:31] <taplar> lol, seeing as how this is a teaching room....
[13:07:38] <sine0> well i have made a javascript calculator and i dont want my rivals to steal the code ive sweated over. we all know each other and check each other sites regularly
[13:08:04] <taplar> any encoding you do to your logic, has to be undone for it to run in the browser
[13:08:14] <taplar> as such, anyone can figure that out and run it to get the unencoded logic
[13:09:01] <taplar> best thing you can do really is to uglify it so it's hard to understand, imho
[13:09:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to be able to run it, and to do that it needs to be JS soooo.
[13:09:28] <MikeD_> you could implement your code on the server, then your clientside (untrusted) code sends the inputs to the server
[13:09:44] <taplar> though i'm not sure how many people will want to steal a javascript calculator
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:10:02] <MikeD_> well he didn't tell you what it calculates
[13:10:08] <taplar> true
[13:10:41] <MikeD_> if it successfully calculates winning lottery numbers, then it'd be worth stealing
[13:11:46] <MikeD_> i expect that program is really just a promise that settles by returning more promises
[13:11:53] <sine0> to you guys its kids stuff, but to me and the other people they are tough rivals. I used to work with the competition and they wanted this particular calculator, i know they will try and get their tech guy to steal it. at the end of the day im not totally bothered about it being taken its just the 2 rivals that are trying to compete.
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> sine0 there's really no recourse without moving it server-side.
[13:12:29] <sine0> robertmaxrees: so could I do it with asp
[13:12:44] <sine0> like create some functions server side and get the info from that
[13:12:53] <taplar> how many operations does your calculator do?
[13:13:52] <sine0> its like a quotation system that works out prices from chosen values. lengths, withs, types and a few extras. I dont know what you mean by operations
[13:14:05] <taplar> is it enter in all the info, and get result
[13:14:10] <sine0> no its live
[13:14:13] <sine0> onchange
[13:14:21] <taplar> or is it varying ways of entering information and you can get different results by choice?
[13:14:32] <sine0> I tried to do it with php but eventually hit a dead end and had to go javascript
[13:14:44] <MikeD_> can we see it?
[13:14:49] <sine0> it calculates it realtime as you change the sizes
[13:14:59] <taplar> that's not what i'm asking
[13:15:03] <sine0> its kids stuff
[13:15:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:15:16] <taplar> does it do just one thing, or many things?
[13:16:03] <sine0> one thing
[13:16:23] <sine0> calculates the cost of the inputs. then php paypal buttons add to cart.
[13:16:31] <taplar> ok, so then you can just have a submit or an ajax call that hits and endpoint, give it all the info, and let it return you the result
[13:16:49] <taplar> asp, php, whatever backend you are good with can do that
[13:19:38] <sine0> ok ill look it up thanks
[13:22:39] <taplar> thinking about it, it would kinda be interesting if they had implemented like an <input type="mask"> or something
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> html5 supports masking - you want some kind of block.
[13:25:25] <taplar> hmm
[13:30:21] <sine0> So what does it do, mask parts of the page from viewsource like php
[13:31:19] <taplar> the 'masking' i was referring to is related to another persons question about wanting an input field that looks like a password field, but isnot
[13:31:41] <taplar> i'm not aware of what html5 masking does
[13:35:06] <robertmaxrees> "masking" just makes sure it's in a marticular format.
[13:35:14] <robertmaxrees> it's not about hiding anything.
[13:35:59] <taplar> lol, i just thought of something
[13:36:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:36:24] <taplar> .income { background-color: #FFF; color: #FFF }
[13:36:30] <taplar> :D
[13:42:01] <taplar> if my ux friend was still here he'd probably slap me for suggesting that
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd slap you for even thinking about it hahahaha
[13:42:25] <taplar> ^_^
[13:43:03] <rabitz> Hi, I'm trying to remove some dynamically generated divs with find() but it doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong? 3 line snippet: http://pastebin.com/ZGuV0LXy
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:43:24] <robertmaxrees> forsdt/
[13:43:26] <taplar> $new is not attached to the dom
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> *first - class=".new-tags-suggs"
[13:43:36] <robertmaxrees> remove the perido int he html.
[13:43:48] <robertmaxrees> second: .find() looks for descendents.
[13:44:03] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to get the parent of an element ath has no parent.
[13:44:16] <rabitz> that snippet is in a loop
[13:44:21] <rabitz> it has parents lol
[13:44:46] <taplar> can you show a more complete example?  and try taking off the . in the class like rob said
[13:45:01] <rabitz> f...
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> waiot nvm i can't read.
[13:45:11] <rabitz> it's the dot :))
[13:45:24] <rabitz> sorry guys I'm blind and tired :x
[13:45:46] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[13:45:57] <taplar> is there always going to be a thing with that class in there?
[13:46:24] <taplar> if so i might suggest replaceWith() for a single operation
[13:46:36] <rabitz> nah, that's the idea.. it's a box of suggestions which is not there on first load :)
[13:46:42] <taplar> k
[13:58:21] <iaj_> Hi folks, when I'm inside a $('#header a').on('click', function() { … } call, is it somehow possible to access some attribtues from a?  Like a data-step ?
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> $(this) represents the element.
[13:58:40] <robertmaxrees> so you could thi $(this).data('step'), etc.
[13:58:48] <iaj_> $(this).attr('data-step')?
[13:58:49] <iaj_> oh
[13:58:51] <iaj_> ok thanks
[14:05:54] <iaj_> Hm my markup looks like that,  <a data-step="7" class="btn btn-primary btn-hero">EINMALIGE CHANCE ZUM UPGRADE</a>       but $('#header a').data("step"); does return undefined
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> how many <a> tags do you have?
[14:06:26] <robertmaxrees> in your header?
[14:06:41] <iaj_> 2, hmmm... ok is it chosing the other one :D
[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> usually the "first" one in the matched set.
[14:07:50] <hlve> EINMALIGE CHANCE ZUM UPGRADE
[14:07:50] <iaj_> Yeah, it chose the second :)
[14:07:50] <hlve> lol
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> it's gettingh the first in the set.
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> not the second >.>
[14:14:19] <iaj_> Hmm. strange.. it was empty until I changed the second a data-step attribute
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:14:47] <iaj_> http://pastebin.com/bSiUDi1k   << is there something wrong about that?  If I put the $url directly into the $.ajax url: call it works
[14:14:52] <iaj_> But not like that :/
[14:15:15] <robertmaxrees> are you sure data-step is set?
[14:15:36] <iaj_> robertmaxrees: yah its working now after I changed the second a tag to data-step as well
[14:15:38] <robertmaxrees> also: var $url = '/fileadmin/templates/osp/upsell/linker.php?step=' + $s;
[14:16:04] <robertmaxrees> pop a slash in front of that.
[14:17:38] <iaj_> ah.. omg :/ Yay thanks a lot its working now :)
[14:38:41] <Juinn> taplar: having problem with line 114...html not changing
[14:47:54] <taplar> that sux
[14:48:04] <ableto> lol
[14:50:39] <ableto> freecodecamp is brutally boring
[14:54:26] <taplar> is that a room
[14:54:27] <taplar> ?
[14:54:47] <robertmaxrees> looks like an alternative to codecademy\
[14:58:49] <taplar> hmm, i wonder how they calculate their $$$
[15:06:39] <robertparkerx> join #php
[15:07:02] <taplar> but i'm a loner...
[15:08:04] <htmlend> I'd like to make it so when Someone clicks a button on my website 3 input fields are displayed. And I want 3 more to display each time this button is clicked. Can anybody point me in the right direction to do such a thing?
[15:08:32] <taplar> which part you having problems with?
[15:12:01] <htmlend> just not sure how to go about doing it tbh
[15:12:27] <taplar> ok, so, to handle for the click on the button http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:12:38] <taplar> to add more elements to the dom http://api.jquery.com/append/
[15:23:10] <ableto> taplar: sorry it's like robertmaxrees: said
[15:26:02] <MikeD_> should $.extend() always start with {} or is that unnecessary?
[15:26:17] <taplar> the first element is what is extended
[15:26:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:26:38] <taplar> using {} just makes it essentially a clone
[15:27:06] <MikeD_> does it mutate the original object?
[15:27:16] <MikeD_> i've only ever assigned it to a new variable
[15:27:20] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> "An object that will receive the new properties if additional objects are passed in or that will extend the jQuery namespace if it is the sole argument."
[15:27:27] <MikeD_> oh
[16:19:21] <btracht00> using jquery validate...i would like to errorPlacement based on error message
[16:19:48] <btracht00> i know i had it working but cant figure it out now
[16:20:04] <btracht00> what is the if statement?
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want to put the mnessage around the current element?>
[16:21:37] <robertmaxrees> *near the current element, reather.
[16:22:01] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> wut\
[16:23:07] <btracht00> if error message == 'error 1' message goes in div 'error1
[16:23:15] <btracht00> if error message == 'error 2' message goes in div 'error2'
[16:23:46] <robertmaxrees> you can just nab the element that has an error.  it does that part for you.
[16:24:29] <btracht00> i know i can use errorPlacement based on message tho
[16:24:36] <robertmaxrees> why would you?
[16:24:52] <btracht00> certain fields will have multiple error messages and i wouldf like them dispalyed in different places
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to read the returned data and manually do thjat yourself.
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it to be of more help.
[16:26:59] <btracht00> also if required i just want to highlight (no message) but if number of charcters required i would like to display message
[16:27:03] <btracht00> is that possible?
[16:27:18] <robertmaxrees> should be.  iirc jquery validate allows that kinda stuff.
[16:28:36] <btracht00> so... if error message == 'this field required' highlight, if error message == 'please enter 6 charcters' display
[16:28:43] <btracht00> how do i do that
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3890431
[16:29:22] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic gist.
[16:29:31] <btracht00> thanks
[16:29:37] <robertmaxrees> you want multiple validation rules per field.
[16:39:37] <ZoderUck> uh hello ?
[16:39:59] <ZoderUck> i have proberbly a small problem with the width of owl  item
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> what is it?
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck
[16:49:34] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:53:31] <MACscr> hmm, so im doing a simply $.post() and while everything is submitting correctly to my php file and its processing it correctly, im seeing 404 returned in the console for the php file its posting to. Any ideas on that? Why would the browser think the server is returning a 404 when its able to reach and interacting with the php file just fine?
[16:54:25] <Juinn> taplar, robertmaxrees: i've almost finished what i started thanks to you pair :)   https://jsfiddle.net/6uf4nhkq/
[16:54:28] <MACscr> is it because Im not doing really much of a response?
[16:54:56] <Juinn> not sure about how i did validation in line 258 > save callback
[16:56:57] <MACscr> also, any suggestions on how i can disable the default action of a submit button and any inline onclick actions for buttons within my visual editor? http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/65/
[16:57:12] <MACscr> that way when im dragging and resizing, they dont get set off
[18:03:22] <TheAvatar> Hello. If I have an url that returns '[11265,10000000]', how would I reference each index? I seem to google response[i], where i is 0 or 1, however, I get the character for each place instead of the index. E.g. response[0] = [, [1] = 1, [3] = 2 etc
[18:03:35] <TheAvatar> Using jquery
[18:03:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery.
[18:03:46] <robertmaxrees> just plain ol' javascript.
[18:03:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta parse it.
[18:04:00] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[18:04:25] <TheAvatar> robertmaxrees, this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/ka5eyGLe
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> right, gotta parse the response.
[18:05:12] <robertmaxrees> you're getting back a string
[18:05:26] <robertmaxrees> needs to be converted to an object, so using JSON.parse() will fix that.
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> also:  newTr.children().eq(1).html('');
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to empty each child therE?
[18:06:01] <TheAvatar> robertmaxrees, like $x = JSON.parse(response)? and $x has what I want, or?
[18:06:08] <TheAvatar> robertmaxrees, yes - they just empty each child
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> you could shorten that to just newTr.children().empty()
[18:06:31] <robertmaxrees> instead of manually hitting each one.
[18:06:53] <TheAvatar> so empty all, then set the few ones I need set to something afterwards?
[18:06:55] <robertmaxrees> and as the documentation I provided, shows, yes - that';s howq you use that, though i'm not sure why you'd prepend with $
[18:07:29] <robertmaxrees> also: newTr.attr("id",response); - why are you shoving the response into the ID like that?
[18:08:17] <TheAvatar> robertmaxrees, ye, nvm the $ - php thing :)
[18:08:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:08:28] <TheAvatar> because I need to know what line it is
[18:08:30] <Krisostoomus> hi
[18:08:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:08:37] <TheAvatar> so each tr has an unique id from mysql
[18:08:54] <robertmaxrees> seems odd but OK.
[18:09:05] <Guest13902> nice girls who want to talk with a interesting guy, write me: krissfive@online.ee
[18:09:17] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[18:09:39] <TheAvatar> this channel seems like the obvious choice for that :)
[18:09:42] <shoky> at least the 2nd time they spam like that ;p
[18:09:48] <TheAvatar> robertmaxrees, looks like it works as expected here, thanks!
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> i woulda just banned 'em the first time heh
[18:14:15] <robertmaxrees> hah looks like he's been k-lines once alreayd.
[18:14:19] <robertmaxrees> *k-lined
[19:55:48] <ZoderUck> hi
[19:56:03] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[19:56:06] <ZoderUck> who uses owl carousel ? i have a question can i ask?
[19:56:21] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck just ask your question.  if somebodyu can help they will./
[19:57:31] <ZoderUck> i have a bit well strange behaviour of the owl width of the image,  when i make the screen smaller the images are smaller, the widt should be fixed size how to achieve this? http://mart-radio-site.ga/  it is a non profit organisation for Suriname people.
[20:02:12] <ISmithers> How would I create a button that will call a function when clicked, but on a timer. If I click the button again, the timer is reset. So use-case is updating cart quantities, I only want to trigger a web request when there is no more button input from the user after say, 1.25 seconds.
[20:02:30] <robertmaxrees> ISmithers you want a debounce
[20:02:41] <ISmithers> I knew there would be a term for it!
[20:03:37] <robertmaxrees> or a throttle, depending on your use case.
[20:04:00] <ISmithers> Thanks robertmaxrees, that will be enough for me to implement it. Appreciated! :)
[20:04:05] <robertmaxrees> def.
[20:04:32] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck looks like there are a few different options to help with that.
[20:04:37] <robertmaxrees> like autoWidth
[20:05:26] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck tho i gotta ask - why not use the carousel with bootstrap?
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> instead of using a different one?
[21:03:05] <harej> This page uses the jQuery sortable method. However, it's very jittery, given that you can either sort an item in the same column or move it to a different column. Other websites with drag-and-drop interfaces don't have this issue. Is there something obviously wrong happening here? https://wpx.wmflabs.org/w/index.php/WPX:WikiProject_Dogs/List_1
[21:03:09] <harej> And relevant source code: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-CollaborationKit/blob/master/modules/ext.CollaborationKit.list.ui.js#L301
[21:35:32] <arosen> is there a way to remove a div using jquery if the element isn't places on the screen? For example  $.get(url, function(data) { var data = $(data).find(".section').get(0).remove('.fooo') }) ?
[21:35:42] <arosen> that doesn't seem to be working
[21:39:46] <shoky> arosen: use .eq(0) instead of .get(0)   and you probably want .find('.fooo').remove() instead of .remove('.fooo')   or maybe .filter instad of .find
[21:44:47] <ZoderUck> i have a bit well strange behaviour of the owl width of the image,  when i make the screen smaller the images are smaller, the widt should be fixed size how to achieve this? http://mart-radio-site.ga/  it is a non profit organisation for Suriname people.
[22:15:03] <efffe> "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://foo.dev/NewSubscription. Response for preflight has invalid HTTP status code 405" Anyone know what this is?
[22:15:55] <Audlex> hey all, basic question. how can i get the array with this name? such like this? var useableArray = pricingArray + $('input[name="Stock"]:checked', '#Form_LabelForm').val();
[22:24:55] <Audlex> not that i am sure why, but window[usableArray] seemed to work
[22:38:54] <efffe> Audlex: https://jsbin.com/lugewoqoya/edit?js,console,output
[23:15:23] <rawburt> OMG
[23:15:40] <rawburt> I wrote my own functions to do some of what jQuery does ages ago before jQuery.
[23:15:47] <rawburt> Could not have thrown out my code faster.
[23:16:05] <acidjazz> ages ago ?
[23:16:06] <acidjazz> like when
[23:16:12] <rawburt> 2003
[23:16:24] <rawburt> 2004
[23:16:35] <rawburt> Was jQuery around then?
[23:17:06] <rawburt> TBH my first AJAX function might of been before then
[23:17:16] <rawburt> Which I thought was fancy because it had a queue :)
[23:18:51] <rawburt> And I've used jQuery some in the past year but tonight I started really drinking the kool-aid, and it is fantastic.
[23:20:55] <rawburt> So I'm wayyy late to the party :)
