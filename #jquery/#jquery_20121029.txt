[00:00:02] <csehl> i might be wrong...
[00:00:31] <Cork> csehl: not sure why you would have to do that
[00:00:32] <CWSpear> I've implemented history.js at the end of the project using almost no modification to get it to work, just adding some code with smart selectors
[00:00:43] <dblosevn> Cork: got kind of an interesting problem, i dont deal much with sortables and draggables so was hoping maybe you could point me in the right direction on this
[00:00:55] <Cork> csehl: you just push the address when you have a new one
[00:01:24] <dblosevn> Ive got a table with meta keys on the left I want to enable dropping to a unordered list on the right
[00:01:49] <dblosevn> easy enough right, now i want the unordered list on the right to also be a sortable
[00:01:58] <csehl> Cork, CWSpear : ill re-check history.js. thanks
[00:02:13] <Cork> by table you mean a ul li list?
[00:02:15] <dblosevn> and last but not least if you drag and drop an item for them unordered list on the right outside of the list it removes it
[00:02:22] <dblosevn> no table
[00:02:27] <Cork> (good)
[00:02:55] <dblosevn> *and last but not least if you drag and drop an item from the unordered list on the right outside of the list it removes it
[00:02:56] <Cork> dblosevn: set the draggable to clone if you want to get a copy
[00:03:19] <dblosevn> i want to completely build a different dom element based on the table row
[00:03:27] <Cork> ya, thats clone
[00:03:36] <GoSox> does anyone else think that the new developer tools in safari 6 are TERRIBLE?
[00:03:37] <dblosevn> totally different structure
[00:03:45] <Cork> ah
[00:03:55] <Cork> that might be a bit more tricky
[00:03:58] <dblosevn> all i want from the table row is some meta data to build the li
[00:04:11] <dblosevn> http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true
[00:04:24] <CWSpear> A lot to get used to, but they are pretty nice, GoSox
[00:04:29] <GoSox> hmmm
[00:04:59] <GoSox> well regardless, is there a place in Chrome's dev tools where i can see the exact URLs that jquery is requesting? Like withink $.get(); commands
[00:05:13] <dblosevn> also when a key is dragged form the table on the left it stays in that table
[00:05:21] <Cork> dblosevn: check the photo-manager example
[00:05:27] <Cork> it should give you the hints you need
[00:05:31] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/droppable/#photo-manager
[00:05:50] <Cork> GoSox: yes, the network tab
[00:06:12] <GoSox> oh nice
[00:06:23] <GoSox> can i clear this list out ?
[00:06:27] <dblosevn> seems the ul on the right will be both a sortable and a draggable
[00:06:48] <dblosevn> and a droppable
[00:07:49] <dblosevn> drop target for draggable table row, draggable to delete a key from the ul, and sortable to order the keys in the ul
[00:09:44] <dblosevn> can i even do that though lol a draggable droppable sortable ul?
[00:09:51] <GoSox> yeah safari needs to go back to these dev tools, teh ones that are still in chrome
[00:09:53] <GoSox> SO much better
[00:10:15] <Cork> dblosevn: you can connect a sortable to a droppable
[00:10:20] <Cork> no need for draggable
[00:10:33] <dblosevn> how do i handle a drag out to delete
[00:10:52] <dblosevn> if its not a draggable
[00:11:48] <dblosevn> if its dropped outside of the ul i want it to remove it
[00:12:05] <GoSox> i'm trying to do $lat.toPrecision(5)  where $lat is "42.652" as a string. how can i typecast that to a float?
[00:12:06] <Cork> uh, outsid the ul?
[00:12:23] <Cork> dblosevn: wasn't the idea to drag it from the table to the droppables?
[00:12:26] <dblosevn> ya if you drag an li outside of the ul i want it to remove it
[00:12:43] <dblosevn> yes, to add a key to the product type drag from table to ul
[00:12:57] <dblosevn> to remove a key from a product type drag it out of the ul
[00:13:24] <Cork> hmm i don't really follow
[00:13:46] <dblosevn> ok, drag a key from the table to a product type on the right <ul>
[00:13:56] <dblosevn> adds an li to the ul
[00:14:17] <dblosevn> if i want to remove that key from the product type <ul> i drag that key out of the ul and drop it anywhere
[00:14:19] <csehl> first thing that confuses the hell out of me with history.js is the 'usage'-chapter on the main page. all they bring up are examples where the url looks like mysite.com/?state=1 . while i asume that fewer users want to achieve this functionality, and more would want urls like mysite.com/projects to activate their $('#projects').on({ click: ... }); functionality. but this is nowhere in the examples
[00:14:48] <Cork> ah, sounds like you want two linked sortables
[00:15:01] <dblosevn> except i dont want the table to be sortable
[00:15:07] <dblosevn> just draggable
[00:15:15] <Cork> i think you can adjust that
[00:15:23] <Cork> but my memory is a bit hazy there
[00:17:07] <dblosevn> if it makes things simpler i could create a drop target for deleting a key
[00:17:38] <Cork> just checked
[00:17:51] <Cork> three different elements ya
[00:18:00] <Cork> but you wouldn't have to have a drop area
[00:18:05] <Cork> just check what element it was dropped on
[00:37:31] <GoSox> is there an easy way to animate a color change? Like a simply changing text from black to a light gray, but doing it gradually over half a second instead of instantly?
[00:38:50] <snowfox_ben> Use CSS3
[00:39:15] <GoSox> i do, how does that help me?
[00:39:36] <csehl> i can make the history.pushState() part working. so now my url in the adress bar is changing according to my states. but how does the counterpart look that i would use to execute my javascript when someone types mysite.com/projects into the address bar? i get a 404
[00:39:39] <snowfox_ben> You can do color change over time with CSS3
[00:39:46] <hgpa> GoSox: http://www.css3.info/preview/css3-transitions/
[00:39:49] <GoSox> what the propery called?
[00:40:09] <hgpa> I just happened to be looking at it when you asked. It's the very first demo
[00:40:18] <snowfox_ben> ^^
[00:40:30] <GoSox> thats cool shit!
[00:40:37] <snowfox_ben> :)
[00:41:07] <GoSox> so if i was going to do this on cue, i just add the css property with jQuery and the transition would start right then?
[00:41:53] <hgpa> if you're moving to CSS3 animation from classic javascript dom manipulation then it deserves a very thorough read. the way to construct them are very different
[00:42:35] <hgpa> i would just use pure CSS if possible
[00:42:35] <klop> thoughts on my store layout?
[00:42:38] <klop> http://i.imgur.com/U7nbA.png
[00:42:46] <GoSox> nice browser support . .  everything has supported it forever, except IE
[00:43:15] <GoSox> anyway me needs foods
[00:52:09] <Knuxgen> klop: i don't like the text being italic
[00:58:26] <klop>  Knuxgen : which text exactly? the home/customer pics text or the top social bar thing?
[00:58:41] <klop> should i make both non-oblique?
[01:13:02] <dblosevn> Cork: still arround?
[01:13:09] <Cork> yes
[01:13:19] <dblosevn> ok i got half of what i want
[01:13:35] <dblosevn> can drag from table to list and it creates the li
[01:13:42] <dblosevn> and the ul is sortable
[01:14:01] <dblosevn> cant quite figure out what event i need to listen to to handle the remove from the ul
[01:14:26] <dblosevn> if an li is dragged outside of the ul
[01:14:42] <dblosevn> ul is a sortable
[01:14:58] <dblosevn> and droppable
[01:17:27] <ENQ> a question about ajax loaded page, the page contains some scripts, $(response) returns array[html_data, script], how to put that script to document body?
[01:17:34] <ENQ> or some other element
[01:20:47] <dblosevn> Cork: the event out looked promosing but... it fires simply when you move a li out of the ul even if you havent decided to drop it
[01:20:55] <munichlinux> ENQ: by the way if you are dynamically injecting script tags inside DOM it doesn't execute
[01:21:14] <ENQ> are you shure?
[01:21:21] <Cork> dblosevn: there should be a cancel event
[01:21:42] <ENQ> i solved it and it seems it works
[01:21:44] <Cork> uh, thats not true
[01:21:53] <Cork> script tags execute just ine
[01:21:56] <Cork> *fine
[01:22:08] <Cork> jquery extracts it from html before it inserts it though
[01:22:10] <dblosevn> when appended to document not when appended to body?
[01:22:12] <Cork> (and appends it to the head)
[01:22:12] <ENQ> what about script with url?
[01:22:36] <ENQ> Cork, it appends it automaticaly? for ajax
[01:22:42] <Cork> no
[01:22:48] <munichlinux> i mean in your body
[01:22:50] <Cork> you need to append it to head or body
[01:22:59] <ENQ> ohh, i do append to body
[01:23:04] <Cork> appending to head is what .getScript does
[01:23:19] <dblosevn> oh i thought you did something like $(document).append('<script/>');
[01:23:22] <Cork> ENQ: if you append to body jquery will automatically move it to head
[01:23:33] <munichlinux> ENQ: did you do innerHTML or created a script tag?
[01:23:45] <Cork> btw your using document.write?
[01:23:55] <ENQ> var script = document.createElement( 'script' ); script=script_from_ajax
[01:24:12] <ENQ> and then document.body.appendChild(script) :D
[01:25:14] <ENQ> is that wrong? :/
[01:27:23] <dblosevn> Cork: grrr no cancel event
[01:28:03] <dblosevn> theres a cancel method but not an event, im going to try beforestop but i think that might not work out
[01:28:23] <Cork> dblosevn: sorry i got a problem i have to handle here
[01:28:28] <Cork> can't help right now
[01:28:38] <dblosevn> k no worrys
[01:29:05] <ENQ> o man, i broke it, it doesnt work any more
[01:34:24] <ENQ> Cork, should i use document.write for script?
[01:34:30] <Cork> no
[01:34:52] <Cork> but if you're using document.write in your scripts jquery will break them
[01:35:49] <ENQ> i see, i dont use it tho, still if i do script=script_from_ajax and then append script to body it doesnt run, if i do script.text=script_from_ajax.text then it works
[01:37:09] <ENQ> i have problems with script with url
[01:37:27] <ENQ> the script tags with url, script with text works just fine
[01:38:23] <ENQ> nvm, i think i know the problem, thanks guys
[01:41:33] <Cork> ENQ: you need a script tag when you append your script
[01:42:24] <ENQ> yes i do create it
[01:42:42] <TheFuzzball> Does jQuery have a method for checking that a node is in the DOM tree?
[01:42:55] <TheFuzzball> The document DOM tree, more specifically.
[01:48:45] <dblosevn> TheFuzzball: if ($('selector').length > 0)
[01:48:56] <dblosevn> TheFuzzball: if ($('selector').length() > 0)
[01:49:20] <Trisox> .length is enough no need for the ()
[01:49:42] <dblosevn> thought length was a function
[01:50:09] <dblosevn> oh oops im tired lol
[01:50:27] <dblosevn> its .size() thats a function
[01:50:33] <dblosevn> length is a property
[01:50:34] <TheFuzzball> I'm talking about a scenario more like this: var $new = $("<h1>Hello World</h1>"); $.contains($new, document)
[01:51:01] <dblosevn> that wont work
[01:51:28] <dblosevn> $new is a new element that does not exist in the dom being it has never been appended to the dom
[01:51:49] <dblosevn> even if there is an element in the dom that matches the content of it it is not $new
[01:52:14] <TheFuzzball> Yeah, and the question was if jQuery supports a method to check if the element exists in the DOM.
[01:52:35] <dblosevn> it does but you need a selector to find the element
[01:53:21] <dblosevn> pretty sure you cant select based on text within a node
[01:54:09] <dblosevn> youd need a wrapper around the text your looking for with an id and you could determine if that id existed or not
[01:54:36] <TheFuzzball> That's truly a horrible solution :)
[01:55:59] <dblosevn> it would be extremely slow to walk the dom and match based on text within a node
[01:56:46] <TheFuzzball> I'm not talking about text within a node, I'm talking about a node itself, it could be a whole tree, or a DocumentFragment
[02:16:55] <mazzachre> Is there a dropin for columns for IE?
[02:20:36] <_timido_wapete> Hola
[02:27:29] <max4o> when using .load() method the data parameters are passed in utf8, how can I set them to windows-1251?
[02:27:35] <max4o> anyone with solution for this>?
[02:31:56] <brass> max4o: i believe it depends on the charset set on that pages <meta> tag.
[02:32:19] <max4o> it's all windows-1251 in the header and in the meta tag but it continue to pass parameters in utf8
[02:32:22] <max4o> this is strange
[02:32:51] <brass> interesting
[02:33:18] <brass> That is something you will need to test and research. Sorry I don't have a direct answer for that question
[02:33:28] <max4o> from yesterday I'm reading articles about this, but the is no solution yet that fits me
[02:33:33] <ejo> Hey, in jquery-ui's "sortable", what receives the "update" event after sorting is over?  I've made a tbody sortable so that its trs can be sorted; but I can't get the table or tbody to receive an 'update' event.
[02:33:56] <max4o> brass: thank you anyway :) i'm writing a script to move cp1251 to utf8 my whole project
[02:39:25] <brass> ejo: is it not just the api update: function(event, ui){ code.... }  ?
[02:42:25] <ejo> brass: yes, i understand that.  But i have tried catching that event in some elements and I can't catch it yet
[02:42:53] <ejo> I tried $('tbody').on(update, function (event, ui) { ... } );
[02:43:00] <ejo> also tried 'bind' instead of 'on'
[02:44:25] <ejo> oh wait this is amazing
[02:44:42] <ejo> the event is actually called "sortupdate" and almost all of the documentation names it incorrectly
[02:45:03] <ejo> I can't believe I wandered around in the darkness about this until I happened to discover that fact in one less prominent document...
[02:54:52] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i try to open a window but it always goes fullscreen, is my code bad? "     window.open('/contacts/gmail', 'auth','auth','width =200, height =400'); "
[02:55:12] <jarr0dsz> have example from docs but it always popups fullscreen
[03:06:26] <seutje> jarr0dsz: you have an excess argument, try window.open('/contacts/gmail', 'auth', 'width=200,height=400');
[03:07:43] <jarr0dsz> I dident see it now try to find an example on how to centrate a new window popup
[03:10:59] <pedda> hi all
[03:26:26] <Trisox> what way do you guys/girls use for input masking?
[03:28:25] <Cork> masking ? you mean visibly displaying the rules in the input field?
[03:29:04] <seutje> jarr0dsz: var height = 400, width = 200, top= screen.height / 2 - height / 2, left = screen.width / 2 - width / 2; window.open('/contacts/gmail', 'auth', 'width=' + width + ',height=' + height + ',top=' + top + ', left=' + left);
[03:29:42] <jarr0dsz> thx seutje
[03:29:45] <seutje> jarr0dsz: basically, grab screen height/width, and set top/left to half the screen height/width minus half the window width/height
[03:30:14] <seutje> ?g jquery mask @ Trisox
[03:30:16] <bot-t> Trisox, digitalBush ª Masked Input Plugin - http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/

[03:31:18] <Trisox> i found http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/mask/mask.html but cant find it on current jquery ui github page
[03:31:20] <seutje> yeah, looks like it'll only work on 1.4.4
[03:31:45] <Trisox> :( yep
[03:32:26] <seutje> looks like mask is in the pipeline to be added to next jquery ui
[03:32:34] <Trisox> yep ;)
[03:32:44] <Trisox> any one knows the state?
[03:32:53] <Trisox> might as well use this
[03:33:14] <Trisox> checking road map 1 sec
[03:33:27] <seutje> looks like there's some ancient version dwelling around though http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/source/browse/branches/dev/mask/ui/ui.mask.js?r=2413

[03:34:23] <NCS_One> hi
[03:34:47] <NCS_One> is it possible to disable a jui button buttonset?
[03:35:25] <Cork> NCS_One: set button('option', 'disabled', true) ?
[03:35:50] <Trisox> cork you got any idea on input masking?
[03:36:22] <Cork> haven't needed it outside old database apps
[03:36:33] <Cork> so no, haven't even looked for it on the web
[03:37:04] <seutje> Trisox: found a branch on somebody's fork that looks like the current development of that plugin: https://github.com/zjs/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.mask.js
[03:37:26] <seutje> 13 days ago, should be fairly recent
[03:37:32] <seutje> there's also a branch with tests for it
[03:37:32] <Cork> :D
[03:37:36] <seutje> so should be pretty solid already
[03:37:38] <Trisox> hmm ;) sounds interesting
[03:38:25] <seutje> gnarf's on the case, so I'm fairly confident :P
[03:39:52] <Trisox> i see indeed
[03:40:03] <Trisox> gnarf: hey

[03:56:34] <ItsJustMe> What could be the reason for getting a "TypeError: $("#sortable").sortable is not a function"?
[03:56:49] <ItsJustMe> In one document it works fine
[03:56:55] <ItsJustMe> In another one it gives this error
[03:57:20] <crab> you haven't included the sortable js?
[03:57:54] <ItsJustMe> Okay, if I haven't .. Why does the first page load exactly as expected?
[03:58:08] <ItsJustMe> I included the whole ui ..
[03:58:27] <Cork> ItsJustMe: a link would make it easier to help you
[03:59:35] <ItsJustMe> I'm not allowed to post the link, because it contains product informations .. I could post a fiddle?
[03:59:39] <ItsJustMe> would that help?
[03:59:48] <Cork> fiddle's down :)
[03:59:56] <Cork> but ya, if you can reproduce the error
[03:59:57] <ItsJustMe> not for me o.o
[04:00:02] <Cork> ah, its up again

[04:04:12] <Cork> ya, cause your not putting that in head
[04:04:15] <seutje> aw man, just dump it all in that one HTML box, why don't u
[04:04:26] <Cork> the html tag is wrapped in the body of the resulting page
[04:04:41] <Cork> ItsJustMe: http://fiddle.jshell.net/nBCWC/show/
[04:05:36] <ItsJustMe> okay, that's not from me o.o

[04:06:56] <ItsJustMe> oh, didn't knew jsfiddle would insert the html, head and body tag by itself ^^
[04:06:57] <Cork> ItsJustMe: it is, jsfiddle wrapps whats in the html tag
[04:08:20] <Cork> seutje: you forgot the onload option :)
[04:08:58] <seutje> Cork: I didn't change that, he had already set it to that
[04:09:11] <seutje> how about you be happy I removed the second reference to jQuery in there? :P
[04:09:19] <Cork> :)
[04:10:07] <Trisox> what i see it works kinda nice
[04:10:08] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/qpyQL/2/
[04:11:45] <ItsJustMe> Oh god, I'm such a dumbass! xD
[04:12:36] <ItsJustMe> Don't know why, but I left another jquery core include at the end of the document -.-
[04:12:58] <ItsJustMe> jquery 1.7 has overwritten the 1.8.2 and the UI
[04:13:00] <ItsJustMe> sorry guys!
[04:13:06] <ItsJustMe> and thanks for your tries :)
[04:13:19] <Cork> :)
[04:13:31] <seutje> so it was the second reference?
[04:13:32] <seutje> ha!
[04:13:33] <seutje> :P
[04:14:18] <ItsJustMe> I bow in front of you, master seutje :P
[04:14:22] <seutje> Trisox: doesn't seem to put the input caret at the beginning though
[04:14:45] <seutje> ItsJustMe: oh please, I suck at this shit
[04:15:13] <Fulf> Hey guys, I'm trying to build a dynamic HTML Form which will change based on the user changing the field's values. I'd like to ask first how should I do it... (PHP, JS, jQ)?
[04:15:54] <Cork> Fulf: put them into hidden elements (ex. divs) and show/hide them based on the selections/values/what ever
[04:16:34] <Fulf> Cork, I have a calendar and I want to connect to a SQL to check if a certain date is available or not...
[04:17:26] <Cork> you could fetch a "view" from the server and let php handle it
[04:17:44] <Cork> or you could keep the form inpage or just ask the server for the status
[04:19:03] <ItsJustMe> okay, now I'm totally crashing my script .. ul normally creates a <br> after every li, doesn't it?
[04:19:09] <ItsJustMe> I should finish for today ^^
[04:19:19] <Cork> no
[04:19:29] <Cork> il is normally block elements
[04:19:36] <Cork> br has nothing to do with it
[04:19:47] <ItsJustMe> yeah, but after every li is a break, isn't it?
[04:19:55] <ItsJustMe> every li gets into one line by me ..
[04:20:01] <Cork> before and after, like all block elements
[04:20:16] <ItsJustMe> okay, I got that crashed and will stop here for now ^^
[04:20:18] <ItsJustMe> Thanks ;)
[04:20:22] <Cork> ItsJustMe: check what display type they are, and check if they'r floated
[04:20:57] <ItsJustMe> display block, float left
[04:21:01] <ItsJustMe> but no break
[04:21:11] <Cork> ya, float will put them "on the same line"
[04:21:22] <ItsJustMe> okay o.Ù
[04:21:46] <Cork> remove the float and the'll be normal lists
[04:23:17] <Trisox> seutje: what do you mean?
[04:23:20] <ItsJustMe> you're all genius! :)
[04:23:25] <ItsJustMe> But I will stop here anyway
[04:23:35] <ItsJustMe> Thank you all so very very much!
[04:24:56] <seutje> Trisox: when I click on the input fields, my input caret is placed at the very end, and typing stuff doesn't do jack shit, I have to manually move the input caret to the start of the field
[04:25:19] <Trisox> ah yeas agreed ;)
[04:25:37] <Trisox> yes thnx for the note ill check that

[05:29:15] <dblosevn> how can i disable dragging an item from one sortable to another with the same class without constraining to parent?
[05:30:39] <dblosevn> eg i want to be able to drag from one sortable to another if the target sortable doesnt have the same class as the sender
[05:32:18] <dblosevn> also while retaining the ability to sort the current sortable
[05:33:20] <Greyhound-> yeah, nevermind... just had to set hide: ""
[05:43:22] <kllkkl> hi
[05:43:44] <kllkkl> someone want help?
[05:44:02] <kllkkl> >>
[05:44:03] <kllkkl> ??
[05:44:28] <kllkkl> hallo
[05:44:30] <dblosevn> wow eager lol, got a problem with a sortable if you wanna help lol
[05:45:47] <xec_> hehe, that's new
[05:45:57] <dblosevn> i know right
[05:47:09] <dblosevn> im bout to give up lol, ben screwing with this for hours im like 99% there just cant figure out how to keep items from one sortable from being dropped on another sortable
[05:51:51] <enoch> hi all
[05:52:17] <enoch> i modified a script from jquery tools( only the datetime part), but it conflicts with some of my other scripts
[05:53:16] <enoch> http://pastebin.com/7SvbrpFY here is the script
[05:53:48] <enoch> how can i fix the conflict? is there a way to debug it? and see what function makes the conflict
[05:58:14] <xec_> dblosevn: isn
[05:58:22] <xec_> dblosevn: isn't there an option for that?
[05:58:55] <xec_> dblosevn: something like http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-containment
[05:59:06] <Trudko> Guys I am getting error unexceped call to method or proerty in bgiFrame plugin for jquery autocomplete IE 6 z index bug. Code  http://jsfiddle.net/UYBJb/ line  this.insertBefore( document.createElement(html), this.firstChild ); Any idea why?(I am using IE 6 , i have to )
[06:00:19] <dblosevn> xec_: the problem is i do in some instances want to be able to drag an item out of the list, i just dont want to be able to drag from one list to another
[06:00:44] <dblosevn> for instance, i want to be able to drag out of the list into the body to remove an item
[06:01:04] <dblosevn> but dont want to be able to drag out of one list into another
[06:02:17] <enoch> ...
[06:04:17] <xec_> dblosevn: i know droppables have an "accept" option, but i'm not sure if sortables have
[06:04:37] <dblosevn> they dont seem too :-(
[06:10:37] <prax> heyho
[06:11:15] <prax> i could rage :D somebody knows about problems with IE(9) and checkboxes?
[06:12:02] <xec_> dblosevn: have you looked at the receive event? maybe you could return false; in it or do a .cancel()
[06:14:46] <xec_> prax: elaborate please, what's the issue?
[06:15:21] <dblosevn> xec_: http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true
[06:15:41] <dblosevn> you can drag a row from the table on the left to a type on the right
[06:15:58] <eip56> mornin all
[06:16:07] <dblosevn> you can sort the keys inside of the type
[06:16:21] <dblosevn> you can drag a key out of a type into the body and it removes it
[06:16:35] <dblosevn> but i dont want to be able to drag a key from one type to another
[06:16:45] <prax> xec_: i cannot simply get the status of a checkbox by $(selector).attr('checked')... it returns just nothing
[06:17:05] <dblosevn> $('.selector').prop('checked');
[06:17:09] <xec_> prax: have you tried .prop() ?
[06:17:14] <xec_> what dblosevn said :)
[06:17:17] <prax> prop? no
[06:17:17] <prax> xD
[06:17:22] <prax> it returns bool?
[06:17:26] <dblosevn> yes
[06:17:33] <prax> okay let me test
[06:18:01] <dblosevn> you follow me xec?
[06:18:09] <xec_> dblosevn: yes, looking
[06:19:56] <espen_mn> Whats the difference between $(document).ready     AND             $(window).load    ?
[06:20:40] <xec_> dblosevn: i think maybe, when a key (ram) is on a type (cable) it is both droppable and sortable
[06:20:45] <dblosevn> espen_mn: http://4loc.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/documentready-vs-windowload/
[06:21:05] <espen_mn> dblosevn: thanks a lot
[06:21:08] <dblosevn> np
[06:21:13] <xec_> no wait
[06:22:19] <dblosevn> refresh it i pulled the code i was trying to use to stop the drop into another type
[06:22:57] <xec_> i'm looking at admin/js/product-type.js right?
[06:23:01] <dblosevn> it also wont let you drop the same key twice into a type that may be what your looking at?
[06:23:22] <dblosevn> that has all the code for the type ul's
[06:23:27] <xec_> no i was looking at the list instead of the item
[06:23:34] <xec_> so nevermind that :)
[06:23:46] <dblosevn> the draggable is set in product-meta.js
[06:24:22] <Trisox> gnarf: your there?
[06:25:57] <xec_> dblosevn: ok, did you try with the containment option?
[06:26:02] <xec_> i don't see it in there
[06:26:18] <dblosevn> ya that does what i want except i can no longer drag to body to remove
[06:26:24] <xec_> ah, right
[06:26:39] <Trudko> Guys I am getting error unexceped call to method or proerty in bgiFrame plugin for jquery autocomplete IE 6 z index bug. Code  http://jsfiddle.net/UYBJb/ line  this.insertBefore( document.createElement(html), this.firstChild ); Any idea why?(I am using IE 6 , i have to )
[06:27:38] <prax> omg I LOVE YOU GUYS
[06:28:55] <prax> xec_: so, should i use prop or attr to change the status?
[06:29:21] <dblosevn> yes
[06:29:25] <dblosevn> @ prax
[06:29:32] <dblosevn> checked is a property
[06:29:57] <prax> no xD i mean, which function should i use to manipulate the checked status, attr or prop
[06:30:06] <dblosevn> prop
[06:30:11] <prax> okay
[06:30:13] <dblosevn> as checked is a property
[06:30:34] <dblosevn> $('.selector').prop('checked', true);
[06:33:29] <dblosevn> im thinking i may just add containment and add a delete button to each item
[06:35:25] <enoch> i have a conflict from jquery tools and fancybox mcustomscrollbars
[06:35:37] <enoch> how can i debug it and understand why it conflicts?
[06:38:33] <prax> dblosevn: okay last question, i have a click event which should check all checkboxes with a class, so also prop function? becaude the docs say "just the first element"
[06:39:01] <xec_> dblosevn: yeah i'd probably do something like that too
[06:39:16] <dblosevn> $('.selector').each(function () { if this.checked } );
[06:41:59] <xec_> $('.selector').each(function () { this.checked = true } );
[06:42:00] <xec_> ?
[06:42:27] <dblosevn> no if (this.checked ==  true)
[06:42:52] <xec_> dblosevn: i think he wants to check them (not check if they are checked)
[06:42:53] <xec_> hehe
[06:43:02] <dblosevn> oh
[06:43:04] <prax> yes, both versions work
[06:43:04] <dblosevn> oops
[06:43:09] <prax> attr and prop
[06:43:16] <prax> but dont know hich is better
[06:43:22] <dblosevn> attr is not the way to go
[06:43:26] <xec_> you dont need .each() when you're setting values iirc
[06:43:35] <dblosevn> checked is not an attribute its a property
[06:43:55] <xec_> just $(".class").prop("checked", true) would set all off them
[06:44:10] <prax> okay thx
[06:44:17] <dblosevn> xec_: yes, only when getting to you need each
[06:44:24] <dblosevn> *do
[06:45:44] <dblosevn> grrrrrr now its even worse
[06:46:41] <enoch> can someone help me debugging a script?
[06:47:03] <dblosevn> ?example
[06:47:07] <bot-t> dblosevn, Tutorials:Live Examples of jQuery - jQuery Wiki - An interactive demonstration of the basics behind jQuery. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Live_Examples_of_jQuery
[06:47:12] <xec_> ?demo @ enoch
[06:47:12] <bot-t> enoch, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:47:16] <dblosevn> ya that
[06:47:18] <xec_> :D
[06:49:00] <dblosevn> grr, what is making my delete button repeat itself
[06:49:56] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: link?
[06:50:09] <enoch> xec_ http://www.facetocity.com/definitive/partner/riccardocariotti click on the bigger photo
[06:50:21] <jonathancutrell> enoch: I'm sure someone can, but they'd have to be able to see the script first...
[06:50:32] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Nm. :)
[06:51:08] <dblosevn> jonathancutrell: http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true
[06:51:10] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Looks like you don't have fancy box included
[06:51:29] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: what button?
[06:51:31] <enoch> fancybox is inluded: if i delete jquery.tools.js it works
[06:51:49] <enoch> i need to make the two scripts work togheter
[06:51:50] <dblosevn> drag something from the table on the left into the ul on the right
[06:52:07] <dblosevn> then reorder the ul on the right
[06:52:35] <xec_> enoch: what if you reorder the inclusion (fancybox after tools)
[06:52:38] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: Are you using jQuery UI?
[06:52:45] <dblosevn> yes
[06:53:27] <dblosevn> jonathancutrell: http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/js/product-type.js
[06:54:52] <Trudko> guys anybody was fixing autocomplete ie 6 z-index error in jquery ui?
[06:55:09] <enoch> xec_ http://www.facetocity.com/definitive/partner/riccardocariotti the same
[06:55:09] <dblosevn> upgrade ie?
[06:55:39] <Trudko> dblosevn: not option here trust me i would
[06:55:50] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: I would imagine it's happening somewhere in the drop callback, but I can't really tell.
[06:55:55] <enoch> xec_ if you try to type something in the searchbar on the right column you will see another conflict
[06:56:06] <xec_> enoch: but it works if you don't include the tools?
[06:56:12] <enoch> xec_  sure
[06:56:37] <xec_> what does it do?
[06:56:59] <enoch> xec_ try now
[06:57:03] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: I would recommend using a templating language,
[06:57:05] <enoch> deleted jquery tools
[06:57:15] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: and use that to populate that area.
[06:57:39] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: jQuery tmpl is alright, so is mustache (or the handlebars variant)
[06:58:34] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: That will keep things cleaner. Also, get your inline styles out of your html (that is in your javascript) !
[06:58:37] <xec_> enoch: maybe the tools thing is doing something crazy like overwriting the $ or something
[06:58:51] <xec_> enoch: question is, what do you need it for
[06:58:53] <enoch> xec_ i cant understand can you check please?
[06:59:03] <jonathancutrell> dblosevn: The less html and css you can do in your JS, the more maintainable it will be in the long run.
[06:59:09] <enoch> xec the reservation tool on the bottom
[06:59:20] <enoch> it is a dateinput
[06:59:23] <nights> hm
[06:59:34] <nights> if max_capacity refers to volume
[06:59:49] <xec_> enoch: jquery ui has a datepicker, if that's what you're after
[06:59:51] <nights> what is max_??? for load (weight)
[06:59:59] <nights> max_displacement?
[07:00:19] <enoch> xec_ it is different
[07:00:22] <dblosevn> i think its turning the ul for my button container into a sortable too
[07:00:43] <enoch> xec_ is not a big script: http://www.facetocity.com/definitive/js/jquery.tools.min.js how can i check if it overrides $?
[07:01:19] <gnarf> Trisox: sup
[07:01:27] <jonathancutrell> enoch: it Doesn't.
[07:01:45] <jonathancutrell> enoch: It's a self-invoking anonymous function
[07:01:46] <xec_> enoch: i'm not about to manually go through some random ("not-so-large" 817 line) plugin code to see exactly what it does, but it does appear to be the culprit indeed
[07:01:54] <jonathancutrell> enoch: and it passes in jQuery for the $
[07:02:14] <enoch> jonathancurtell so?
[07:03:17] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Also, check out this:
[07:03:21] <jonathancutrell> enoch: http://www.jshint.com/
[07:03:32] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Worth running that code through.
[07:03:58] <jonathancutrell> (function($, window) {  ‚Ä¶ a bunch of code ‚Ä¶ })(jQuery);
[07:04:09] <xec_> enoch: where is the code that's using the tools plugin located?
[07:04:19] <jonathancutrell> enoch: /\ That's the basic structure the siaf that's holding that file.
[07:04:32] <xec_> jonathancutrell: why are you explaining this?
[07:04:43] <xec_> i mean, i'm all for spreading knowledge
[07:04:50] <enoch> xec_ here? http://www.facetocity.com/definitive/js/booking.js
[07:04:52] <xec_> but what does it have to do with the issue
[07:05:39] <jonathancutrell> xec_: first, so that we understand that the $ sign is referring to jQuery
[07:05:55] <jonathancutrell> xec_: Secondly, if we search for "jQuery" in that file,
[07:06:12] <jonathancutrell> xec_: There are only 4 instances, none of which redefine jQuery.
[07:06:38] <jonathancutrell> xec_: So, jQuery retains its definition as far as this file is concerned.
[07:06:53] <xec_> maybe, maybe not
[07:06:59] <jonathancutrell> xec_ enoch My presumption is that there is a version issue
[07:07:03] <xec_> that's not definitive proof in any case :)
[07:07:11] <xec_> yes, version sounds likely
[07:07:30] <jonathancutrell> xec_: As far as this file is concerned, it is definitive proof. Outside of this file, I can't say.
[07:08:14] <enoch> so?
[07:08:20] <jonathancutrell> enoch: What is the dev link again?
[07:08:28] <enoch> dev link?
[07:08:37] <jonathancutrell> enoch: The link where we can see what you are developing...
[07:08:56] <xec_> jonathancutrell: not really. it is only proof that $ inside the script refers to jQuery outside.
[07:08:57] <Trisox> gnarf i was looking at the jquery ui mask
[07:09:07] <Trisox> what is the state of it?
[07:10:06] <jonathancutrell> xec_: The SIAF is, true, but what I said was that every time jQuery was referred to (the string "jQuery") in the script, it wasn't being redefined. So, again, this means that jQuery isn't redefined by that script.
[07:10:15] <enoch> jonathancutrell: http://www.facetocity.com/definitive/partner/riccardocariotti
[07:10:23] <enoch> and click the big photo
[07:10:24] <Trisox> gnarf: i was looking to implement it
[07:10:44] <gnarf> Trisox: the lastest updates are on the mask branch of jquery-ui repo
[07:11:00] <gnarf> The demos should be pretty self explanitory
[07:11:50] <Trisox> gnarf: i found https://raw.github.com/zjs/jquery-ui/mask/ui/jquery.ui.mask.js
[07:12:39] <ENQ> does on() support multievents? $('').on("click, dblclick", function(){});
[07:12:41] <xec_> jonathancutrell: take this asshole code for instance; (function($){ window["$"] = "what"; })(jQuery)
[07:12:43] <wild_oscar> do you guys know of any up-to-date jquery cheat sheet?
[07:12:48] <wild_oscar> the one I have is for 1.4
[07:12:56] <gnarf> ENQ: no comma - just space separated list of events
[07:13:04] <ENQ> ty gnarf
[07:13:23] <enoch> xec_  jonathancutrell, any ideas?
[07:13:25] <gnarf> Trisox: make that jquery/jquery-ui and you'll have the latest stable build of it
[07:13:29] <kreature> I'm trying to make my controlgroup buttons in jquery mobile expand to full width. Check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/PwNnq/ The Yes/No button should stretch to full width but I can't make it happen
[07:13:35] <kreature> anyone who can help me do this?
[07:13:37] <xec_> jonathancutrell: an edge case for sure, but all i'm saying is just because you're inside an iife, it doesn't mean you can't screw up things outside. searching for the word "jQuery" in the file doesn't really prove anything
[07:13:44] <kreature> ideally it should be aligned to the bottom of content as well
[07:13:48] <Trisox> oke
[07:14:26] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Looking. $ and jQuery both are retaining their values; however, $.tools is undefined as well, which makes me think there's another problem somewhere.
[07:14:38] <Trisox> gnarf: got a link ?
[07:14:39] <enoch> :(
[07:15:08] <enoch> where? and where to find a good debugger?
[07:15:36] <jonathancutrell> xec_: Thats fair. I guess I should have clarified - there is only one instance of window in that file as well, and it is being passed to the $() function
[07:16:00] <jonathancutrell> enoch: Not sure. You said if you removed tools, everything works as expected? Can you do that real quick?
[07:16:54] <jonathancutrell> xec_: I first ran a search for window (I was going to search for a direct redefinition of window.jQuery), but window wasn't defined.
[07:16:55] <wild_oscar> do you guys know of any up-to-date jquery cheat sheet (1.8-ish)
[07:16:56] <Trisox> gnarf: this one ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.mask.js
[07:18:59] <jonathancutrell> enoch xec_ Here's a slightly reduced test case to check the tools file: http://jsfiddle.net/YwT7F/
[07:19:03] <gnarf> Trisox: yup
[07:19:16] <Trisox> any currency masking planned?

[07:21:21] <Flo0815> hey guys, i have a list filled with dynamically added items (ajax). Now I want to distinguish between mousedown and mouseup on one of these added elements. How do i do that? thx
[07:22:25] <xec_> jonathancutrell: sorry, ignore that, the console.log should have been $.fn.test
[07:23:02] <jonathancutrell> xec_: :)
[07:23:46] <jonathancutrell> xec_: The weird part is that the fancy box html is being inserted.
[07:23:49] <bil`> Can anyone help me with a quick scoping issue? Not sure why citiesObj is undefined outside the API function on line 15 when its set to the callback data already on line 7 https://gist.github.com/34bf42e232251fa157ae
[07:24:05] <jonathancutrell> xec_: It's almost like jQuery is being loaded a second time later or something.
[07:24:31] <Trisox> gnarf: any plannes for optional mask parts like ____,__   to 10,01
[07:25:32] <gnarf> Trisox: it hasn't been on the list - might want to post something on the PR asking https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/494

[07:36:38] <stefancrs> .width() is returning zero for me on elements with images with width: auto when executed on document ready, but if I execute it later I get the widths... http://pastie.org/5132573
[07:36:43] <stefancrs> any ideas?
[07:38:52] <dblosevn> stefancrs: document.ready is called before images load window.load is what your looking for
[07:39:05] <stefancrs> dblosevn: thanks!
[07:39:28] <dblosevn> np
[07:39:59] <stefancrs> worked a treat :)
[07:40:10] <stefancrs> and +1 in my wisdom bucket
[07:40:11] <stefancrs> cheers
[07:40:38] <dblosevn> xec_: so now i got a whole new problem my drop on my droppable is being fired on sort of the sortable now
[07:41:04] <dblosevn> if i remove the delete button all is fine
[07:41:53] <dblosevn> damn i got to go do manual labor now :-( didnt realize how long i had been screwing with this
[07:42:35] <TeckniX> Hello peeps - Is there an easy way to remove associated jQuery data/events from an element without removing the element?
[07:42:45] <dblosevn> gotta go drop a couple ip cams in the drive thru at a mcdonalds 100 miles away :-(
[07:43:04] <NoiseEee> TeckniX: presumably you could probably .off() everything
[07:43:20] <xec_> dblosevn: they better give you some free milkshake!
[07:43:25] <stefancrs> freakshake
[07:43:47] <dblosevn> lol, dont know if its a new store or an upgrade they might not even have a shake machine
[07:44:02] <TeckniX> NoiseEee: thanks I'll look through the API for how .off() works :)
[07:44:06] <dblosevn> workorder doesn say
[07:44:29] <dblosevn> i always knew id eventually end up working at mcdonalds lmao
[07:45:05] <PaladinPSK> Becareful with that milkshake. I heard it brings many boys to your yard.
[07:45:26] <dblosevn> lmao
[07:47:05] <dblosevn> mofo.... event.preventDefault() in the stop event on my sortable fixed it
[07:47:13] <clocKwize> hi guys, I want to decide programatically where the tab key takes a user from my input box - what is the best way?
[07:48:14] <timing> clocKwize: look at the tabindex attribute on form elements
[07:48:17] <dblosevn> grrrrr but also made my sortable not sortable
[07:48:26] <dblosevn> im so done with this lmao
[07:48:28] <timing> clocKwize: with tabindex="-1" you can skip certain elements
[07:48:37] <clocKwize> timing, thats not programmatically
[07:48:58] <timing> okay, but it is the best way
[07:49:03] <clocKwize> i.e. I want to disable default and have the browser say "hey, where should I go, someone tabbed from this box here"
[07:49:40] <dblosevn> clocKwize: listen for the tab key on the element
[07:49:59] <dblosevn> clocKwize: manaually focus the element you want
[07:50:12] <timing> and if you want the broser to say something you can use alert: alert("hey, where should I go, someone tabbed from this box here");
[07:50:15] <dblosevn> clocKwize: and event.preventDefault
[07:52:13] <clocKwize> dblosevn, thanks. timing, nice try.
[07:52:16] <clocKwize> :p
[07:52:48] <timing> clocKwize: but what is the end result? When a user tabs from <input name="email" /> you always wants it to jump to <input name="phone" /> ?
[07:53:04] <timing> or is it dynamic based on some other rule?
[07:53:55] <clocKwize> based on some logic
[07:53:59] <clocKwize> ie programmatically
[07:54:09] <clocKwize> its simpler than that, but its not alaways email->phone
[07:54:32] <timing> okay, and just setting tabindex dynamically on page load is not good enough?
[07:55:06] <ideaprison> I'm using ‚ùØ $('.loader').animate({opacity: 0}, 700, function() { $('.loader').remove(); }); << the div gets removed without fading at all. Anyone see whats wrong with that line
[07:55:28] <clocKwize> i have a table that emulates a grid of inputs in some ways, some cells are textboxes, some are buttons, some are just text... if you are in a textbox you want to be moved to the one directly to th eright, if there are no more to the right, it should move to the one directly below
[07:55:40] <clocKwize> also columns are dynamically shown and hidden
[07:57:00] <ideaprison> clocKwize: how about .closest() to find the nearest element so your input fields
[07:57:06] <ideaprison> clocKwize: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:58:44] <clocKwize> ideaprison, that traverses up the tree, the nearest could be down the tree, or in another child of its parent
[07:59:18] <clocKwize> besides, I can do the things I want to do with code, I just didn't know the best way to capture the event. keydown capturing keyCode 9 seems annoying but ok..
[07:59:21] <clocKwize> that'll do :)
[08:02:15] <alfanso> Hi, I'm seeing a very weird issue. I've an inputbox (not within any form) and I'm listening to keyup event on it. On IE all keyup events are captured except ENTER key. and when ENTER key is hit, it finds nearest Submit button and triggers click event of that button.
[08:02:28] <alfanso> has anybody faced this issue? Is this a known issue with IE ?

[08:30:50] <smftre> I have a div (position:relative), with many absolute positioned elements dynamically placed in it. how can I get the height of the parent div to wrap around the children?
[08:32:06] <smftre> Could I do something like $("#theParent").height( $("#theParent").children().height() ); ????
[08:32:38] <smftre> ?
[08:32:41] <hlve> o_o
[08:32:41] <hlve> Hm
[08:32:46] <hlve> it's chained correctly
[08:33:03] <smftre> there must be a way to get the height of it all
[08:34:02] <smftre> or perhaps use the window's height?
[08:34:51] <smftre> I can use document.height,.
[08:36:40] <MagmaRules> Hi there,  anyone has any clue why this http://pastie.org/5132842 would throw an parseerrror when using ajax ?
[08:37:08] <clocKwize> so, I have $tr. to get the next editable tr in the table, I'm using $tr.next(".editable") - this works, unless its not directly next - whats the correct way? I thought next would find the first matching element after the current one in its parent
[08:44:49] <Aicasn> is anyone familiar with the validate plugin for jquery? I would like to be able to validate parts of a form as a response to click events, but I'm not sure how to go about it. http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ here's the validation plugin i'm using
[08:45:00] <Guest2290> hey is it possible use just one click funtion for many items?
[08:45:15] <xec> Guest2290: sure.
[08:45:26] <Guest2290> doing something like $('#item'+index).clcik(....)
[08:45:41] <Guest2290> how?
[08:46:01] <CWSpear> Aicasn: There are a couple different approaches
[08:46:02] <xec> well i don't know about .clcik() but if you want to select multiple items, you normally don't use an id :)
[08:46:12] <enderx86> Can someone please tell me why this jquery doesn't work?
[08:46:13] <enderx86> http://pastebin.com/1Kt88GZH
[08:46:28] <CWSpear> The easiest is to just call .validate() (or whatever it's called) on the form, and give a class of "required" to any elements you want required.
[08:46:43] <CWSpear> It adds in a label after the element or something, so do some testing, see the markup and style as needed.
[08:46:50] <xec> Guest2290: if you have a more specific question (what are you trying to achieve) it might be possible to give a more specific answer
[08:47:10] <Aicasn> CWSpear: my form is split up into pages (javascript scroll page-to-page). i want to validate page 'N' of the form before going to page 'N+1'
[08:47:29] <Guest2290> Yea I'm trying to add dynamically some checkboxes and other DOM elements
[08:47:55] <Aicasn> CWSpear: i can set required elements as 'required', that's not a problem. i'm just not sure how to tell the validator to validate elements in "this" part of the form, rather than the whole thing
[08:47:59] <xec> enderx86: what is the code supposed to do? what happens instead?
[08:48:07] <Guest2290> so I'm trying to add them like name="checkbox1","checbox2" for instance
[08:48:16] <enderx86> I get a blank page. IT's supposed to create a pie chart out of a JSON
[08:48:31] <CWSpear> Aicasn: I did this recently. There is a way to validate just a subset of elements instead of binding it to the form, but it's actually flawed. I had to patch the source code. It seems to be an issue, but almost no one uses it that way, so no one's really gotten around to doing anything about it.
[08:48:33] <xec> enderx86: any errors in console?
[08:48:45] <Guest2290> so I'm trying to have just one function to capture clicks from that elements
[08:49:09] <Guest2290> is it possible with JQuery
[08:49:16] <enderx86> I'm very unfamiliar with web programming - don't know how to check console.
[08:49:19] <Aicasn> CWSpear: i'm all ears
[08:49:48] <CWSpear> var is_valid = $('.step-1').find('input, select, textarea').valid();
[08:49:52] <xec> Guest2290: yes. if you have a css selector that selects all the items you want? (maybe add a class to the items?)
[08:50:18] <xec> Guest2290: look at the delegate syntax for .on(), see ?on
[08:50:18] <bot-t> Guest2290, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:50:29] <xec> enderx86: i do see a couple of typical mistakes though. see ?ajax101
[08:50:29] <bot-t> enderx86, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:50:33] <CWSpear> Aicasn: I think the bug was related to conditional rule, such as company_state: { required: function() { return $('#company_country').val() === 'US'; } }
[08:50:47] <xec> enderx86: also important: see ?async
[08:50:47] <bot-t> enderx86, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user‚Äôs ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[08:51:18] <CWSpear> it always returned undefined because a certain step returns nothings (return;) if you're validating a single element or whatever. I can't remember exactly. But it should return something else, and everything worked as expected.
[08:51:38] <Guest2290> xec: thanks man
[08:52:09] <xec> enderx86: the fixingthesejquery.com link is awesome, especially if you're new to javascript debugging
[08:52:14] <Aicasn> CWSpear: i see. let me try some of that out. thanks!
[08:52:28] <CWSpear> Aicasn: yep =-
[08:52:31] <CWSpear> =)*
[08:52:42] <xec> enderx86: the methods varies slightly between browsers
[08:53:57] <Aicasn> CWSpear: btw, since you fixed it, did you submit a patch to the maintainer?
[08:54:16] <CWSpear> There was a specific reason I didn't, but maybe I should just do it and let them sort it out
[08:54:47] <Aicasn> were you using the same validator plugin that I'm using?
[08:54:54] <CWSpear> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ 1.9
[08:55:37] <Aicasn> i'm using 1.10, but yeah
[08:57:15] <resno> question: when using multiple js files, are there anything suggestions on how to make it better?
[08:57:30] <resno> minifying is one ive read about
[08:57:59] <Aicasn> CWSpear:  http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/changelog.txt    any chance your bug is in the 1.10 list?
[08:59:07] <enderx86> xec: thanks
[08:59:50] <enderx86> xec: I was following google's example code: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/php_example
[08:59:57] <enderx86> so should I set async: true?
[09:00:50] <NoiseEee> enderx86:  you're going to have to completely rewrite their xhr/ajax example to use callbacks
[09:00:51] <xec> enderx86: definitely. but that also means you won't get the results back at the time the $.ajax() function is done
[09:01:23] <CWSpear> Aicasn: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/219 seems to be talking about the same issue, and according to the changelog, 1.10 fixed issue 219, but they didn't fix it the same way I did, but I'd go with that.

[09:01:37] <CWSpear> Thanks socialhapy.
[09:01:46] <MagmaRules> Guys if i do $("<hmtl>‚Ä¶</html>") jquery is injecting css in my page can i stop it from doing it ?
[09:01:52] <xec> the reason why google would use such lousy code for an example eludes me though
[09:01:59] <enderx86> i have no need for callbacks
[09:02:08] <enderx86> i just want to create a pie chart from a json
[09:02:09] <enderx86> that's all!
[09:02:10] <xec> enderx86: actually, yes you do
[09:02:21] <enderx86> ok
[09:02:45] <NoiseEee> enderx86: please, listen.
[09:02:45] <xec> enderx86: the first A in AJAX stands for Asynchronous, and the way to do this is with a callback
[09:02:59] <CWSpear> and the X stands for XML‚Ä¶ what's your point?
[09:03:03] <CWSpear> just kidding ;-)
[09:03:20] <xec> CWSpear: i like to think it stands for XMLHttpRequest() ;D
[09:03:34] <CWSpear> Nice!
[09:03:50] <xec> that way the acronym is still valid and my OCD can get a rest
[09:04:12] <CWSpear> Which technically, is still a bit of a misnomer in practical usage, but still much better since we actually deal with it.
[09:04:58] <xec> well, yes, the function is badly named to be sure
[09:05:04] <xec> i blame ms for that one
[09:05:09] <CWSpear> xec, how do acronyms (backronyms?) like WINE and PHP settle with you?
[09:05:18] <xec> haha
[09:05:34] <CWSpear> You could be writing it for a long time.
[09:05:41] <xec> i love them, but i spend ages explaining what they stand for
[09:05:45] <xec> :D
[09:06:13] <enderx86> okay
[09:06:15] <enderx86> so how do i do this?
[09:06:16] <xec> i thought wine just stood for "windows emulator" or something though
[09:06:24] <CWSpear> I'm not super familiar with the inner workings of WINE, but isn't it technically an emulator?
[09:06:40] <CWSpear> WINE Is Not (an) Emulator
[09:06:49] <xec> haha right
[09:06:59] <xec> enderx86: did you go through the slides?
[09:08:02] <code_ph0y_> CWSpear: wine is an alcoholic beverage ... so no its not an emulator
[09:08:35] <xec> enderx86: basically $.ajax() sends off an HTTP request (and returns immediately). then later on the HTTP request is done and the callback is fired. inside the callback you have access to the data
[09:10:01] <enderx86> right
[09:10:09] <xec> enderx86: a callback in this case is just a function which is executed when the request is done
[09:10:14] <enderx86> right
[09:10:27] <enderx86> so I have the line: google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart)
[09:10:50] <enderx86> that probably doesn't accomplish what i want, i.e. setting the callback for http requests when they return
[09:11:08] <xec> indeed. that seems to be a callback for when the google api is loaded
[09:11:21] <NoiseEee> enderx86: your ajax function needs a callback, which will be a function you create to "continue", ie: run the google stuff
[09:11:52] <enderx86> right. how do i set the callback for my ajax function?
[09:12:19] <xec> enderx86: check the examples, see ?ajax
[09:12:19] <bot-t> enderx86, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:12:32] <Pnoexz> hey, is there a way to use multiple selectors in the same statement? something like $('div && blockquote')
[09:14:02] <CWSpear> Just like CSS selectors:
[09:14:08] <CWSpear> $('div, blockquote')
[09:14:22] <Pnoexz> CWSpear: thanks
[09:14:26] <CWSpear> that matches all divs and all blockquotes
[09:14:27] <CWSpear> yep

[09:20:08] <brainwarped> xec: I wanted to use an admin widget outside of the admin site, and I couldn't figure it out. I like the filtered select multiple widget. looking for a jquery replacement.
[09:22:25] <xec> brainwarped: i'm not sure what that is, maybe a combobox?
[09:23:58] <xec> brainwarped: have you seen this? http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[09:24:04] <brainwarped> xec: http://anentropic.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/more-django-mptt-goodness-filteredselectmultiple-m2m-widget/
[09:24:16] <brainwarped> xec: its a combobox on steriods:)
[09:24:47] <xec> oh yeah, that looks a bit complex
[09:25:14] <xec> i wonder if that type of control has got an official name
[09:26:39] <EyePulp> looking for advice - I've got a chat application that loads via a single js script tag on a page - I don't necessarily control the page, but my script uses jquery and plugins heavily.  I need to cleanly separate my plugins (namespace) from any potential use of jquery and plugins on the original html page my code will be embedded on.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/ looked like what I wanted, but is being deprecated - any idea how to g
[09:26:40] <EyePulp> that functionality now? (or where the new plugin version for .sub() is?)
[09:26:47] <brainwarped> xec: chosen looks good if you can add a better tree structure to it... I need a tree structure too.
[09:28:32] <Pnoexz> EyePulp: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jQueryNameSpace
[09:29:19] <xec> brainwarped: i don't think i've seen a plugin that does all this
[09:29:39] <Pnoexz> ah, that gif doesnt have all the frames aligned correctly, y ODD is acting up
[09:29:40] <xec> might be a handful to create from scratch too
[09:29:49] <Pnoexz> OCD*
[09:29:52] <brainwarped> xec: its pretty sweet, right? thats why I wanted to reuse the widget,
[09:31:18] <brainwarped> xec: i guess  i could spend another day trying ot get the jsi18n nonsense to work outside of admin
[09:31:37] <EyePulp> Pnoexz: thanks, but I it appears that plugin would essentially rely on every other plugin playing by the same rules, and I can't guarantee that when my code is run on a third party page.  I need essentially a cloned jquery copy, ala: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[09:32:17] <brainwarped> xec: the widget doesn't load because the admin's selectFilter2 renames jquery to django.jquery.
[09:34:03] <xec> brainwarped: i see. can't you just do something like: var jQuery = django.jquery;
[09:34:46] <xec> or rename the reference from jQuery to django.jquery in the widget code
[09:35:18] <xec> of course i know nothing about django or your solution so i'm just spitballing here ;)
[09:36:09] <brainwarped> how would you do var jquery =django.jquery?? javascript doesn't like naming a variable django.jquery...
[09:36:36] <brainwarped> xec: I'm going to try the second solution tho...
[09:36:54] <xec> assignment is from right to left :P
[09:37:01] <brainwarped> xec: the second solution requires doing a lot of editing tho.
[09:37:06] <sh0ne> how can I change " data-btn='publish' " to " data-btn='unpublish'  "  using .data()?
[09:37:21] <xec> brainwarped: most likely it's in an iife with a single reference
[09:37:45] <xec> brainwarped: look at the end of the file, see if it ends with something like )(jQuery);
[09:38:19] <brainwarped> xec: })(django.jQuery);
[09:38:21] <xec> sh0ne: .data() doesn't change attributes - use .attr()
[09:38:33] <xec> brainwarped: that looks correct already then
[09:38:48] <sh0ne> xec: great, thank you very much
[09:39:21] <brainwarped> xec: but when I call that code outside of the admin interface, it draws a reference error because it can't find "django"
[09:40:48] <brainwarped> xec: I run a jquery.init.js that simply puts jQuery into the namespace "var django = {"jQuery": jQuery.noConflict(true)"
[09:40:53] <xec> brainwarped: okay? so... the django object (along with jquery and whatever else) just doesnt exist?
[09:41:22] <brainwarped> xec: right, outside of the admin interface, django object doesn't seem to exist...
[09:41:25] <xec> are you inside a (function) scope with this var?
[09:41:57] <brainwarped> xec: i dont know what that means, sorry.
[09:42:13] <xec> where is this var django... code
[09:42:25] <xec> actually, do you have a url?
[09:42:29] <brainwarped> in the file, jquery.init.js
[09:42:51] <xec> i'm just throwing out guesses based on wild assumptions
[09:43:30] <brainwarped> xec: this is the file that throws the error: http://dpaste.org/jfajA/
[09:44:10] <xec> yeah but thats just because "django" doesnt exist in the global scope, right?
[09:44:24] <brainwarped> xec: http://dpaste.org/c213r/ this is the jquery.init.js file
[09:44:40] <brainwarped> xec: yes
[09:44:55] <xec> and the init file is run before the widget
[09:44:55] <enderx86> What is wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/4iBc4fmS
[09:45:01] <enderx86> It's not displaying my JSON that I get through my XHR
[09:45:29] <brainwarped> xec: no... let me try to change that.
[09:45:31] <xec> enderx86: on line 13 you have a function
[09:45:57] <xec> enderx86: the .done() callback. it gets supplied the data through the 1st argument
[09:46:21] <xec> enderx86: so do xhr.done(function(data) { // i gots my data
[09:47:56] <enderx86> thanks xec
[09:48:56] <enderx86> it's still not displaying any data
[09:49:18] <xec> what does your code look like now
[09:50:36] <enderx86> http://pastebin.com/aBc0F03Y
[09:51:35] <xec> enderx86: looks right. do you see the http request getting sent off? and the response?
[09:51:55] <enderx86> when i replace console.log(obj) with alert('success')
[09:51:59] <enderx86> i get the alert-success dialog box
[09:52:21] <xec> ok good. maybe the server isn't sending what you're expecting?
[09:52:31] <enderx86> now, when i type localhost/get_chart1_data.php into my url box
[09:52:48] <brainwarped> xec: wow, you fixed it:)  I pulled in the jquery.init with the form's media, but that changed the order for some reason, so I manually called each file, and it works:)
[09:52:53] <enderx86> the php simply echoes (and the page displays) the following:
[09:52:55] <enderx86> {"dsagr_strng":1.49,"dsagr_slght":3.36,"neiher_dsagr_agr":2.03,"agr_slght":25.56,"agr_strng":64.95}
[09:52:57] <brainwarped> xec: Thanks!
[09:53:09] <xec> brainwarped: nice! glad you got it sorted :)
[09:53:43] <brass> enderx86
[09:53:47] <brainwarped> xec: now i just have to modify the widget to use a tree. jQuery is using jsTree these days?
[09:54:01] <brass> enderx86: it looks like you are doing a vardump( $obj );
[09:54:54] <enderx86> here is my PHP script: http://pastebin.com/2iDzKDLc
[09:55:26] <brass> enderx86: is your ajax call expecting a json object to be returned in the callback?
[09:55:31] <xec> enderx86: and what do you see when you do the console.log() ?
[09:55:59] <xec> brass: he's just got a console.log atm, see http://pastebin.com/aBc0F03Y
[09:56:39] <brass> i see, and i see his php script is using creatng the json object and echo'ing it to screen.
[09:56:53] <Pnoexz> enderx86: fyi, you dont need heredox/nowdoc in PHP for multiline strings. Unlike javascript, a new line doesnt break your string
[09:57:00] <Pnoexz> heredoc*
[09:58:17] <xec> brainwarped: never heard of jstree before
[09:58:26] <enderx86> Pnoexz: good to know, thanks
[09:58:50] <enderx86> xec: I see nothing with console.log
[09:59:08] <xec> enderx86: nothing at all? not even undefined or null
[09:59:28] <xec> enderx86: what if you do console.log("hollaback!")
[09:59:43] <xec> just to make sure you're looking in the right place
[09:59:49] <brainwarped> xec: http://www.jstree.com/ its linked to from jquery's website...
[10:00:24] <xec> brainwarped: really? where
[10:00:31] <enderx86> http://pastebin.com/DtsMXgZS
[10:00:32] <Pnoexz> enderx86: what does alert(typeof obj) say?
[10:00:35] <enderx86> that's my javascript
[10:00:55] <brainwarped> xec: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Treeview
[10:01:06] <enderx86> it says "object"
[10:01:51] <Pnoexz> enderx86: are you getting any errors in the console?
[10:01:52] <xec> brainwarped: ah-well the plugins site doesn't have much to do with jquery really
[10:01:54] <brainwarped> it says "check out jsTree for a more up to date plugin"
[10:02:16] <xec> yeah apparently, it was called treeview before?
[10:02:28] <Pnoexz> enderx86: have you tried.... for (x in obj) { console.log(x + ': ' + obj.x) }
[10:02:59] <Pnoexz> i always hated how javascript doesnt tell you anything about the object.. just says "object"
[10:03:08] <xec> try console.dir()
[10:03:11] <xec> much better :P
[10:03:32] <Qiller> hi all, can i print without dialog using jquery?
[10:03:41] <xec> i.e. console.dir(obj) instead of the loop
[10:03:48] <enderx86> ok
[10:03:52] <enderx86> i'll try console.dir(obj)
[10:04:14] <xec> but you should see something in console just by doing console.log() too
[10:04:36] <Pnoexz> enderx86: you could also print the object it in a monospace font, add a new line, encode and decode it and print it again.. from the PHP side.. just to compare it
[10:04:40] <xec> which is why i suggested you try it with just the string to see if your console is in order
[10:04:47] <hlve> So you guys all staying safe today?
[10:05:00] <hlve> is #jquery surviving sandy?
[10:05:27] <enderx86> when I navigate to my PHP page
[10:05:28] <enderx86> it displays
[10:05:29] <enderx86> {"dsagr_strng":1.49,"dsagr_slght":3.36,"neiher_dsagr_agr":2.03,"agr_slght":25.56,"agr_strng":64.95}
[10:05:46] <Pnoexz> that looks about right
[10:05:51] <enderx86> so now how do i access that json from my javascript?
[10:06:10] <xec> enderx86: what did you get with the console.dir(obj)?
[10:06:24] <Pnoexz> enderx86: let me show you how im doing it..
[10:06:50] <firstclassfunc> what tools exist to create html elements programatically
[10:06:53] <Pnoexz> enderx86: http://pastebin.com/YJHvbKhR
[10:06:56] <enderx86> i get nothing with console.dir(obj)
[10:07:20] <xec> enderx86: where are you looking
[10:07:38] <xec> you know what the console is by now, right?
[10:07:41] <enderx86> absolutely not haha
[10:07:42] <Pnoexz> enderx86: are you sure the .done() method is being called? are you getting any errors in the console?
[10:07:48] <enderx86> i basically started javascript this morning
[10:07:59] <xec> ?ftj @ enderx86
[10:08:00] <bot-t> enderx86, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:08:28] <xec> enderx86: carefully go through the slides. it will save you a lot of time and frustration
[10:08:36] <Pnoexz> it always saddens me when people start learning a language using a framework
[10:09:25] <enderx86> haha I'm using console now
[10:09:33] <Qiller> maybe js
[10:09:33] <enderx86> console gives me the JSON and its attributes
[10:09:38] <xec> Pnoexz: i know exactly what you mean. but then again, the reason you get into js nowadays is often because of ajax, and i'm not about to reccommend vanilla js for that ;)
[10:09:51] <xec> s/recc/rec
[10:10:19] <Pnoexz> Warning: recc not found
[10:10:41] <xec> but it's right there! *points*
[10:10:49] <Pnoexz> aaaaaaaah, i see it now
[10:10:59] <xec> xD
[10:11:00] <Pnoexz> i was looking for /recc /
[10:11:11] <xec> heheh
[10:11:18] <Pnoexz> silly me, vi(m) is smarter than me
[10:11:19] <enderx86> what was that about document.write being outdated?
[10:11:29] <xec> enderx86: yeah stay away from it
[10:11:30] <Pnoexz> you never want to use document.write
[10:11:34] <enderx86> what should i use now?
[10:11:34] <Pnoexz> NEVER
[10:11:46] <Pnoexz> console.log() console.dir() alert()
[10:11:49] <enderx86> just want to say, the jquery channel is so much more friendly than the javascript channel. thank you
[10:12:02] <xec> enderx86: if you want to insert something into the document, you usually have a html element you want to put it in
[10:12:26] <enderx86> i see
[10:12:27] <xec> enderx86: so you can select it by ID for example, and use .text() for instance
[10:12:42] <enderx86> yay, it works now - with console log / console dir
[10:12:45] <enderx86> great :-)
[10:12:50] <enderx86> beaucoup thanks!
[10:13:20] <Pnoexz> i still remember the pre-firebug days, it was so awful
[10:14:53] <xec> hlve: i'm norway. is that considered safe enough? :)
[10:15:26] <Pnoexz> an entire country? that sounds awesome
[10:15:49] <xec> in*
[10:15:51] <xec> heheh
[10:16:03] <Pnoexz> :P
[10:16:13] <Pnoexz> ok, back to work
[10:17:29] <zfly9> Hey guys I have the same slider and almost identical site at http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and http://67.225.219.106/ the slider will be black every once in a while and will take a couple hard refreshes for it to come back, is there anyway to stop this before I go live?
[10:18:08] <zfly9> ... actually hard refresh doesn't work a lot of the times, clicking the logo (going to home page) will get it to reappear
[10:18:40] <xec> zfly9: are you able to reproduce the issue in jsfiddle?
[10:18:47] * xec steps away
[10:20:51] <zfly9> xec its down
[10:21:26] <xec> seems ok to me. what about jsbin.com or tinker.io
[10:37:16] <zfly9> xec http://jsbin.com/welcome/41133/
[10:37:30] <zfly9> how can I call the js files?
[10:39:43] <xec> <script src="... ?
[10:40:15] <zfly9> hmm got errors from that jsbin
[10:42:25] <slick-> hey, if i have something like: <label for="email_address" label="testing">Email Address</label>
[10:42:39] <slick-> how do I make j query find tha label and change it
[10:46:34] <NoiseEee> slick-: use a selector of your choice
[10:46:56] <NoiseEee> $('label[for="email_address"]) for example
[10:52:01] <slick-> ok cool
[10:52:04] <slick-> then how do i set the label
[10:52:05] <slick-> to soemthing?
[10:52:38] <zfly9> xec http://jsbin.com/welcome/41133/
[11:00:19] <zfly9> Hey guys I have the same slider and almost identical site at http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and http://67.225.219.106/ the slider will be black every once in a while and will take a couple hard refreshes for it to come back, is there anyway to stop this before I go live?
[11:00:28] <zfly9> ... actually hard refresh doesn't work a lot of the times, clicking the logo (going to home page) will get it to reappear
[11:01:15] <fonko> Hey guys does anybody knows of a channel related to sqlserver?
[11:04:28] <fonko> Anyone?
[11:06:03] <CWSpear> fonko: there is a #sql on freenode
[11:08:19] <fonko> CWSpear, but I'm not being allowed to chat, how does it work?
[11:08:33] <CWSpear> I don't know. You might have to sign up.
[11:09:49] <fonko> Sing up? Never done that, for an irc channel?
[11:09:52] <CWSpear> Do you have a SQL-related question?
[11:10:23] <CWSpear> You would have to register your username, and then it makes it so only you can sign in as your username. Like to verify it's you.
[11:10:40] <enderx86> When I open this in a web browser, it gives me the error 'Table has no data.' However,  a call to console(dir) shows that the object DOES have data.
[11:10:42] <enderx86> http://pastebin.com/x13qSgPV
[11:10:55] <fonko> Actually I have a friend that does and I was trying to find him a channel for him
[11:10:58] <enderx86> Any idea why this is happening?
[11:11:21] <Tomashe> i have a class name SUBMIT on an input button , but when i run $(".SUBMIT").submit(); its not working , any ideas?
[11:11:54] <CWSpear> Tomashe: submit() is called on the form, but the submit button.
[11:11:58] <vinici> Tomashe submit is on form
[11:12:07] <vinici> not in the submit button
[11:12:23] <Tomashe> yes sorry i ment the type="submit"
[11:12:26] <Tomashe> not button
[11:12:27] <CWSpear> So you might have $('.SUBMIT').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $(this).closest('form').submit(); });
[11:12:43] <fonko> Oh I got it Know... I've identify with nickserv now
[11:12:54] <vinici> Tomashe prefer add a id in the form and do: $('#id').submit()
[11:12:57] <Tomashe> hmm but i have few submit buttons
[11:13:06] <Tomashe> i really want it to "click" on that specific one
[11:13:17] <CWSpear> well, how ever you connect it
[11:13:39] <Tomashe> ok let me try
[11:14:11] <Tomashe>  $(".SUBMIT").live('click',(function(event) {
[11:15:28] <Tomashe> hmm doesnt looks like its working hmm
[11:15:29] <JFranks> Where can I grab a new copy of the themes that support the latest features like tooltip/spinner? Currently only my 'base' theme works on pages where I've tried using the new features.. ;p
[11:15:58] <Tomashe> $(".SUBMITADDCART").live('click',function(event) { 						  	 event.preventDefault(); 							 var thisid = $(document).find(".SELETEDSIZE").attr("id");							 $(".SUBMIT"+thisid).submit(); 						  });
[11:16:03] <Tomashe> my code is like that actually
[11:16:06] <Tomashe> will that work?
[11:16:16] <Tomashe> cuz its not hehe
[11:16:31] <CWSpear> You have to call submit() on a form element
[11:16:34] <enderx86> Does anyone have experience with Google Chart's DataTable class?
[11:16:50] <CWSpear> so does your form have a class of "SUBMIT<SomeID>"
[11:16:50] <JFranks> You may also be missing a C in selected size
[11:18:02] <Tomashe> it is inside a form ofc
[11:18:27] <NoiseEee> enderx86: doesn't seem like you're passing any data/arguments to drawChart
[11:19:46] <enderx86> I'm passing a json to it
[11:19:54] <NoiseEee> you're not passing anything to it
[11:20:13] <Tomashe> ohh?
[11:20:13] <NoiseEee> enderx86: xhr.done(function(data) { drawChart(data); });  <--- try that
[11:20:18] <Tomashe> yes
[11:20:23] <Tomashe> my form no
[11:20:27] <Tomashe> my submit button yes
[11:20:33] <Tomashe> CWSpear
[11:20:46] <CWSpear> Yes, Tomashe?
[11:20:52] <NoiseEee> enderx86: and really you should take the time to learn javascript before trying to make things
[11:21:27] <Tomashe> look i have a few submit buttons there i want to preform a specific click on one of them using jquery
[11:21:40] <Tomashe> i dont want to just submit the form
[11:22:00] <CWSpear> if you pass in the event and do event.preventDefault() on the submit button, that will prevent it from submitting
[11:22:21] <CWSpear> er, on the form
[11:22:35] <Tomashe> ok
[11:22:50] <Tomashe> so how do i make it "click" on a specific submit input
[11:22:51] <Tomashe> ?
[11:24:08] <CWSpear> Tomashe: http://pastie.org/5133590
[11:24:30] <JFranks> Sorry to repeat, but this should be a simple Q: Where can I grab a new copy of the themes that support the latest features like tooltip/spinner? Currently only my 'base' theme works on pages where I've tried using the new features.. ;p
[11:25:12] <Tomashe> ok lets check it out
[11:25:26] <CWSpear> JFranks, are you talking about for jQuery UI?
[11:25:57] <JFranks> Oh yeah.. sorry.. just assumed most in here dabble in both
[11:26:13] <CWSpear> I just wasn't sure the context
[11:26:14] <JFranks> (Since it's in the topic.. )
[11:26:43] <JFranks> Heck I'd normally asking in #javascript but this is too damn specific. ;)
[11:27:16] <CWSpear> No, you're good, I just haven't played with the new UI stuff, so I didn't know they had a Spinner, so I wanted to be sure I knew what you were talking about.
[11:27:30] <ajpiano> JFranks: if you take your old theme, it should have a permalink url you can use to regenerate a new theme
[11:27:33] <CWSpear> I would start with http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ set up your theme, then do a custom download uncheck everything but tooltip and spinner.
[11:27:46] <raj> can I prevent FOUC in this code? http://paste.ofcode.org/FQpkKYcTDdLCft2ussxr8L
[11:28:07] <CWSpear> what ajpiano said is a good idea, too. I know jQuery Mobile has it, but I didn't see a "load theme" on the UI Theme Roller
[11:28:20] <ajpiano> there's just a peramalink in your theme.css that should do the trick
[11:28:57] <CWSpear> raj, the font should already be loaded, so there shouldn't be a flash
[11:29:09] <raj> there is
[11:29:24] <raj> probably from any styles i set in the .js file that I'm loading
[11:29:38] <JFranks> Thanks I'll take a look.. I did the themeroller but I unchecked all thinking I just want the new theme none of the features.. could explain my issue.. I tend to see the wrong way of viewing/reading UIs so easily. ;)
[11:29:40] <CWSpear> The flash is because the fonts aren't yet on the client, but once there are, any new content should instantly be the said font.
[11:29:49] <voidr> raj: how big are those CSS files that you are loading dynamically?
[11:29:58] <raj> not that big
[11:30:19] <raj> lack of styling is from the .js file I'm using $.getScript() on I think
[11:30:23] <voidr> raj: then you should probably just contacatanate them and put it in the header
[11:30:24] <CWSpear> Oh, are the font family declarations in the css you're loading dynamically? Maybe you should put them in a stylesheet that's always loaded?
[11:30:38] <raj> not font issue
[11:30:46] <raj> just a general flashing of unstyled content issue
[11:31:12] <voidr> raj: can you show a demo page?
[11:34:15] <JFranks> Grooovy.. that's a bit annoying but I think I'm going to limit the themes the users can have.. Actually.. Without themeroller included on the page.. How easy is it to toggle themes? ... If I wanted to just have a 'Day/Night' toggle?
[11:34:47] <CWSpear> It should be an easy as toggling a class
[11:35:02] <CWSpear> but you would have to load BOTH themes
[11:35:50] <raj> actually, I have a bigger issue, I think I'll need all the js files loaded cuz js files can't be unloaded
[11:36:35] <JFranks> Hmm well it's LAN .. so it's not an insane idea.. Noticing now that Tooltip always loads on the right .. but I need it for items over on the left of the page.. Almost don't even see the tooltip loading.. ;p
[11:37:39] <CWSpear> JFranks, specifically, you can have a default theme, and then you can prefix every selector in a 2nd theme with like ".darktheme" (super trivially easy if you are familiar with CSS pre-processors) and then just toggle darktheme on your body.
[11:37:49] <bil`> I have inside an $.each loop I want to to this to refer back to the main selector and not the iterator object. Not sure how? Can I use $.proxy and if so how? https://gist.github.com/34bf42e232251fa157ae
[11:37:59] <voidr> raj: if you want to avoid FOUC you should include all CSS files in the header, also if you require JS files to render content, you might as well include those too in the header
[11:38:32] <raj> yeah, I'll have a sh**load of conflicts to fix though before those js files can be included
[11:39:40] <bil`> never mind.. ill just cache $(this).. carry on :)
[11:39:42] <CWSpear> bil` a common convention is at the top of the function to set something like var $this = $(this) and then anywhere in the closure, $this is the original element you selected.
[11:40:08] <bil`> yeah hehe
[11:40:09] <CWSpear> haha, yeah. it's better performance, too. I usually do it if I ever use $(this) more than once.
[11:41:52] <bil`> how widely used is the convention of storing query variable using the dollar sign. wondering if i should start doing it
[11:41:58] <CWSpear> JFranks: you saw there is a position option that has a bunch of customization?
[11:42:07] <CWSpear> http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-position
[11:42:46] <CWSpear> bil`: I've seen it quite a bit. My rule of thumb is if it's a jQuery object, it gets a $.
[11:43:26] <JFranks> CWSpear: Yep just diddling with it now.. probably just going to apply it to only the container div in the middle of the page.. ;)
[11:46:27] <ideaprison> Hi, anyone see the problem with this line of code? I only have css display:none; on this element >> $('.loader').animate({opacity: 0}, 1800, function() { $(this).remove(); }); << it removes itself before ever performing the fadeOut
[11:47:09] <CWSpear> ideaprison, is it's display: none, how is it ever visible?
[11:47:25] <ideaprison> oh no, i mean i do use fadeIn earlier!
[11:47:28] <ideaprison> so its visible
[11:47:43] <ideaprison> but when its suppose to fade out, it just blinks off/gets removed
[11:48:06] <CWSpear> why not just use fadeOut? why use animate?
[11:48:18] <CWSpear> $('.loader').fadeOut(1800, function() { $(this).remove(); });
[11:48:40] <CWSpear> And why remove it? Do you load it each time you need it? Why not just keep it hidden on the page?
[11:49:13] <dns-away> hello anyone can give me help with this code, should be countUp :)
[11:49:14] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/xNk82/
[11:49:21] <CWSpear> fadeOut will use visibility to fade it out, and then applies display: none when it's done. Effectively the same thing as removing it. I would just do $('.loader').fadeOut(1800)
[11:49:45] <CWSpear> dns-away, the page isn't loading.
[11:49:55] <dns-away> why
[11:49:58] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/xNk82/
[11:50:06] <CWSpear> I don't know?
[11:50:21] <dns-away> /me
[11:50:38] <dns-away> too
[11:51:51] <ideaprison> CWSpear: well i went this way because fadeOut refuses to work
[11:52:22] <ideaprison> it just instantly is gone
[11:52:38] <ideaprison> while the line i had without the $(this).remove() does fadeout nicely
[11:53:05] <dns-away> CWSpear, possible to make it to countUp,not down.
[11:53:45] <ideaprison> im just dumbfound really since its the most easiest thing to use and i use it all the time
[11:54:48] <CWSpear> ideaprison, is something else removing it or setting it to display: none
[11:56:19] <ideaprison> you might be asking the right question
[11:56:50] <ideaprison> i'm just going to start over, thanks
[11:57:09] <CWSpear> dns-away, it's loading. do you have a setTimeout or setInterval somewhere?
[11:57:18] <dns-away> da
[11:57:27] <ideaprison> no
[11:57:41] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/xNk82/2/
[11:58:22] <ideaprison> nvm my comment i thought i knew what it was
[11:58:41] <ideaprison> so im appending the element to the body and as it suppose to fadeout fade in the main div
[11:59:10] <CWSpear> there ya go
[11:59:30] <ideaprison> *and fade out that new element
[11:59:38] <CWSpear> dns-away, why do you have startTime() on an interval calling updateBody_EH on an interval?
[11:59:39] <ideaprison> but its not in that div its fading in
[12:00:15] <CWSpear> and as to having it count up, you just have to adjust the radians. It's trigonometry or whatever.
[12:01:13] <CWSpear> and adjust the values to count up to it
[12:01:38] <dns-away> Where i have startTime(.)
[12:01:52] <dns-away> :)
[12:02:07] <dns-away> i dont know
[12:02:36] <dns-away> but ok
[12:02:38] <dns-away> thanks
[12:02:40] <dns-away> :-)
[12:11:05] <zfly9> Hey guys I have the same slider and almost identical site at http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and http://67.225.219.106/ the slider will be black every once in a while and will take a couple hard refreshes for it to come back, is there anyway to stop this before I go live?
[12:11:09] <zfly9> ... actually hard refresh doesn't work a lot of the times, clicking the logo (going to home page) will get it to reappear
[12:16:36] <fission6> does it make sense to use .pipe() if you are not returning a deferred / promise?
[12:20:12] <raj> ok, I'm dynamically loading a url using ajax, and placing its content into #content on the current page. However, the .js file that goes along with that loaded url has to be loaded via .getScript(). This causes FOUC issues, as well as some other quirks. A good solution is to just load all needed js files upfront in the base .html file. This, however, causes the issue that elements that are not yet loaded onto the page are attempting to be hidden and ...
[12:20:18] <raj> ... whatnot in $(function(){/*on document ready*/ })
[12:24:36] <devslash> i hope im asking this in a way thats clear but when i refer to a div element using $('#elementname'), does it matter if that div is nested under another div ?
[12:25:46] <coin3d> hi there. is it normal that a variable doesnt exist any longer within a jquery command? why is that so?
[12:25:46] <CWSpear> No
[12:26:40] <frantz> anyone have experience with using easing?
[12:27:03] <CWSpear> frantz: Not writing my own. What do you need help with?
[12:27:24] <frantz> I'm using bxslider, and I need to slow or change how far the slide bounces
[12:27:57] <CWSpear> here are the built in keywords to jQuery UI: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/effect/easing.html
[12:28:04] <CWSpear> do any of those work (click on them to see the effect)
[12:29:14] <frantz> well I'm using easeOutBounce, but I want to adjust the duration of it
[12:31:32] <CWSpear> if it's duration, all jQuery animations have a duration parameter
[12:32:16] <gu_ludo> hello everybody
[12:32:42] <frantz> ok well is there a way to adjust the space between the bounce?
[12:32:56] <CWSpear> frantz: You'd have to write a custom easing function
[12:32:59] <gu_ludo> I think I've found a bug in jQuery.fn.ready function
[12:35:05] <umc> hi guys. anyone knows if there's a jQuery plugin or something that would allow me to display the content of a complex object  in a div ? similar to what firebug has. Only display, nothing fancy. maybe collapse/expand the values
[12:35:15] <mactop> I'm trying to create dynamic validation on groups or radio boxes and am having trouble. The .click() seems to work fine, but it's always executing the inner code for the last iteration: http://pastebin.com/dE1MDYsd
[12:36:11] <Eviltwin> umc: Here's my clone of WebKit's: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fPRXJ/
[12:36:28] <CWSpear> frantz: the function for easeOutBounce looks like it's here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2949636/how-to-use-this-easeoutbounce-method
[12:36:45] <gu_ludo> I think I've found a bug in jQuery.fn.ready function
[12:37:38] <umc> Eviltwin: nice, looks good. exactly what I need. Thank you for the code
[12:37:51] <dsafa> any jquery expert around ?
[12:38:16] <Eviltwin> mactop: Try this: http://pastebin.com/6t6CHpsP
[12:38:25] <Eviltwin> dsafa: Just ask your question
[12:38:35] <dsafa> I need a quick fix on a small code on my website
[12:38:55] <dsafa> ready to tip 10$paypal for the fix pm plz
[12:38:57] <CWSpear> frantz: call this even before $(document).ready(): http://pastie.org/5133887
[12:39:21] <CWSpear> but adjust the numbers as you need.
[12:39:57] <Eviltwin> dsafa: Just link a pastebin wtih the relevant code and explain what the problem is
[12:40:01] <frantz> let me try, thanks
[12:40:10] <Eviltwin> If someone is around who knows how to fix it, they probably will
[12:42:18] <dsafa> cant enter pastebin.com in my country
[12:42:30] <dsafa> captcha problem with proxy too
[12:43:29] <Eviltwin> dsafa: Okay, use pastie? jsfiddle?
[12:43:34] <Eviltwin> ?paste
[12:43:34] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:43:38] <Eviltwin> Or jsbin or fixee
[12:43:40] <frantz> hmm, can't seem to adjust the size of the bounce
[12:44:04] <dsafa> thanks
[12:44:07] <dsafa> here it is : http://pastie.org/5133908
[12:44:23] <dsafa> cant get the shadowbox to open for the new link
[12:45:30] <dsafa> the link is on the #social <div>
[12:45:43] <CWSpear> frantz, did you set the easing when you use it to myEaseOutBounce?
[12:45:55] <xec> dsafa: define "new link"? i don't see a div in that pase
[12:45:57] <xec> paste*
[12:46:52] <xec> dsafa: your html looks weird too, you got some ";height=540;width=420" business going on in the img tag
[12:46:53] <dsafa> http://pastie.org/5133928
[12:46:56] <dsafa> here it is
[12:47:16] <Rya> if the link is in the #social div, you should update the selector on line 14
[12:47:22] <dsafa> that is supposed to be the shadowbox size
[12:47:42] <Rya> from '#gallery a' to '#social a'
[12:47:53] <xec> is the #social inside #gallery?
[12:47:57] <dsafa> I have tried even with $('a') it doesnt work
[12:48:04] <dsafa> no it is not
[12:48:16] <Eviltwin> Maybe need to dleegate it
[12:48:19] <Eviltwin> delegate*
[12:48:20] <xec> dsafa: is the link inserted dynamically?
[12:48:31] <dsafa> no it's in the footer
[12:48:37] <xec> :)
[12:48:51] <dsafa> should I post the web adress ?
[12:48:55] <xec> dsafa: is the script included in the html *after* the link?
[12:49:01] <xec> please do
[12:49:07] <dsafa> yes it is
[12:49:15] <dsafa> http://www.muratsayginer.com
[12:49:25] <dsafa> in the footer the first tweeter button
[12:49:44] <dsafa> it opens a full page insread
[12:49:53] <dsafa> instead*
[12:53:59] <xec> dsafa: what is it supposed to do?
[12:54:12] <dsafa> open the link in a shadowbox
[12:54:21] <dsafa> like the links in the portfolia section
[12:54:31] <dsafa> this time as a html
[12:56:35] <xec> you want to open the twitter site in a lightbox?
[12:56:39] <xec> why
[12:56:40] <dsafa> yes
[12:56:51] <xec> are you sure you want that?
[12:56:54] <dsafa> because I will do that with all the social buttons
[12:56:57] <CWSpear> frantz, did you get it figured out?
[12:57:05] <dsafa> some of them dont popup and they call java
[12:57:11] <dsafa> I want to remove addthis from the site
[12:57:23] <dsafa> I hate how the social plugins can't be customized
[12:57:24] <xec> "addthis"?
[12:57:39] <ravenzz> you can't embed twitter.com in a iframe
[12:57:50] <dsafa> yes it currently works with tumblr blogger..etc
[12:57:56] <dsafa> oh
[12:58:15] <ravenzz> the share thing is different
[12:58:24] <dsafa> hmm
[12:58:30] <xec> clicking the tumblr or blogger buttons opens a new tab for me
[12:58:40] <dsafa> yes but I want to stay on the site
[12:59:02] <dsafa> with small poppups
[12:59:10] <xec> i sincerely recommend you let external links point to external sites
[12:59:14] <fission6> any reason why i keep getting an identifier error when i tru to do something like whatver = {some.json.id: some.json.value}, it does not like '.' in the key
[12:59:17] <ravenzz> what kind of website is yours?
[12:59:46] <ravenzz> is it build with some cms?
[12:59:53] <dsafa> hmm
[13:00:01] <dsafa> no it's not
[13:00:21] <ravenzz> I can give you the link of a website of mine
[13:00:26] <dsafa> sure
[13:00:33] <ravenzz> and you can rip from it if you like
[13:01:18] <dsafa> please do
[13:01:38] <ravenzz> there you go
[13:02:11] <ravenzz> the js is somewhere in the bottom of /js/script.js
[13:02:26] <ravenzz> $('.share a')
[13:02:36] <NoiseEee> fission6: you can't use periods.
[13:03:12] <pifantastic> fission6: put quotes around it
[13:03:17] <pifantastic> fission6: oh, wait
[13:03:41] <pifantastic> fission6: var o = {}; o[some.json.id] = some.json.value;
[13:03:51] <pifantastic> that's what you want ^
[13:04:08] <mactop> Eviltwin: your suggestion about the dynamic functions was perfect. Thanks a ton!

[13:13:59] <enderx86> hi
[13:14:50] <enderx86> anyone here?
[13:14:59] <Rya> sup
[13:15:12] <enderx86> can someone explain to me... (i started with this stuff this morning)
[13:15:35] <enderx86> so ajax is javascript with asynchronous XHR capabilities added
[13:15:50] <enderx86> jquery is... what? is it an AJAX library?
[13:15:56] <enderx86> does it go
[13:16:01] <enderx86> javascript->ajax->jquery?
[13:16:32] <Rya> ah, well, the ajax term is a bit overloaded these days
[13:17:14] <enderx86> i just want to clarify the family hierarchy here
[13:17:19] <fission6> well i want to construct a literal something = {some.object.id:some.object.value}
[13:17:24] <enderx86> is ajax separate from jquery?
[13:17:29] <enderx86> or is jquery a kind of ajax?
[13:17:31] <Aicasn> i'm using jquery validator. when i call .valid() on a field that is not valid, I do see the erorr message beside the field about it being invalid, but the error message is not red like in the demos. any ideas why?
[13:17:55] <Rya> jQuery is a consistent api onto javacript (and handling all the browser quirks that comes with that)
[13:18:12] <Rya> jQuery simplifies a lot of ajax
[13:18:14] <fission6> ravenzz: its not a jsonlint question ithink its a straight js question
[13:18:59] <morris> I think I have found a bug in ie10 metro pre-release that affects jquery. I am pretty sure it is a simple fix too. Anyone here with the IE10 release version able to test a jsbin page to check bug isn't just in pre-release?
[13:19:28] <morris> http://jsbin.com/arerik/1
[13:20:25] <morris> Easy to test, if anyone has release version of IE10...
[13:24:33] <morris> So nobody here using Windows 8?

[13:29:29] <Tomashe> $(document).find().attr("onclick","sub_products_qty_"+thisid+".value = '1';").click();
[13:30:15] <Tomashe> i want to my jquery code to click on the element with onclick attribute = what i wrote
[13:32:47] <Tomashe> bahh
[13:32:52] <Tomashe> sorry for dumb question
[13:35:52] <Rya> what's the html markup you're trying to find?
[13:37:45] <MrPunkin> Trying to find a way to, in a full-screen mobile web app (no browser chrome) handle going 'back' a step. The history API doesn't always know when there is a back step or not, and so I'm trying to think of other solutions. Anyone see a problem with storing an array of the last 50 states in localStorage or something along those lines?
[13:38:58] <nchlssmith1> I've stored stuff like that in local storage and not a real problem
[13:39:45] <CWSpear> MrPunkin, nchlssmith1: I believe there is a hard limit on localStorage, and I think it may change from browser to browser
[13:40:14] <CWSpear> But I think 5MB is the magic number. You can make it a Chrome App and you can get permission for a TON more.
[13:40:16] <nchlssmith1> Thats ture and the user has to acknowledge the storage or accept it.
[13:40:31] <CWSpear> So depending on what you're storing...
[13:40:38] <CWSpear> 5 MB is really quite a lot
[13:42:12] <nchlssmith1> CWSpear; The user can change the amount of local storage that is available.
[13:42:36] <CWSpear> right, but I don't think you need to do anything if you're using less than 5MB
[13:42:53] <MrPunkin> CWSpear: Right, I don't plan on using anywhere near that level
[13:43:12] <MrPunkin> just want to have a persistent state of where they have been so they can go back like you would in a native app.
[13:43:42] <nchlssmith1> MyPunkin: Thats what we did and it worked very well.
[13:43:45] <CWSpear> localStorage is a good option. Remember it can only story strings, though!
[13:43:59] <CWSpear> I think I fall for that every time
[13:44:05] <nchlssmith1> Yeah key value
[13:44:25] <nchlssmith1> thats true we had a parsing system
[13:44:30] <CWSpear> just JSON.stringify it in and JSON.parse it out
[13:44:40] <nchlssmith1> Yeap
[13:44:44] <MrPunkin> CWSpear, nchlssmith1: right. I'll store JSON data.
[13:44:45] <MrPunkin> yep
[13:44:54] <MrPunkin> JSON data stringified that is
[13:45:16] <jd_vinyl> need some help with event.stopPropagation(); on jquery Mobile - have a link inside a label, and when clicking link need to it to only act on the href link - and stop the label from checking a checkbox  - works on regular browsers, but iPhone emulator doesn't
[13:48:21] <Nytician> hi there
[13:49:04] <Nytician> im having an issue with .get its giving me an error when I try to get json files from a local source does this mean I can't do offline javascript games?
[13:49:56] <nchlssmith1> you can do off line storage retrieval
[13:50:10] <nchlssmith1> try the getStorage() method.
[13:51:28] <firstclassfunc> how do I detect when an input field has been changed, not by user, but by code?
[13:51:39] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, ahh ok thanks i'll check it out in the api
[13:52:40] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: onblur??
[13:52:56] <CWSpear> what's the gesture opposite of a pinch? the one that commonly zooms in?
[13:53:08] <Foxhoundz> CWSpear, stretch?
[13:53:26] <Foxhoundz> or Zoom
[13:53:31] <Foxhoundz> there's no "official" name for it
[13:53:32] <CWSpear> Hmm‚Ä¶ that's a bit of a stretch
[13:53:35] <CWSpear> pun intended!
[13:53:40] <Foxhoundz> ha
[13:53:51] <Foxhoundz> maybe expand
[13:53:58] <Foxhoundz> or explode
[13:54:19] <Foxhoundz> or enlarge...or magnify...
[13:54:24] <CWSpear> So far, I have, "anti-pinch, outward pinch, 2 for expand, stretch, zoom"
[13:54:36] <CWSpear> I want the name of the gesture though, not what it does
[13:54:41] <Foxhoundz> Well, what context is this gesture used in?
[13:54:47] <CWSpear> on an iPad
[13:54:57] <Foxhoundz> Ok, but what's the particular action doing?
[13:55:00] <Foxhoundz> Zooming an image?
[13:55:06] <Foxhoundz> Opening a menu somehow?
[13:55:08] <CWSpear> You know what I mean
[13:55:19] <CWSpear> yeah, it's commonly used for zooming in on an image
[13:55:29] <CWSpear> if you pinch an image, it's very common that it zooms out
[13:55:39] <CWSpear> if you ______ an image, it's very common that it zooms IN
[13:55:46] <CWSpear> fill in the blank? lol
[13:55:53] <Foxhoundz> Apple calls it "Pinch to zoom"
[13:56:01] <Rya> I've generally heard pinch to zoom
[13:56:13] <Rya> since its the same gesture just opening or closing the pinch
[13:56:20] <Foxhoundz> CWSpear, http://www.apple.com/osx/what-is/gestures.html
[13:56:36] <Foxhoundz> But I like the term pinch to expand
[13:57:37] <Foxhoundz> Interesting
[13:57:48] <Foxhoundz> Apple has attempted to patent that gesture
[14:00:55] <CWSpear> Foxhoundz, what is the name they tried to patent???
[14:01:00] <CWSpear> doesn't a patent have to have a name?
[14:02:08] <chovy> what's a good tooltip plugin that allows you to click on links inside it?
[14:02:26] <CWSpear> Does the new jQuery UI not let you click on links in it?
[14:02:42] <CWSpear> chovy, Twitter Bootstrap has toggle-able tooltips, so you should definitely be able to have links in there.
[14:02:43] <toddWork> i'm struggling w/ this for loop / setTimeout thing. basically i want the loop to fire an event every 3 seconds, now it just plows right through: http://pastie.org/5134262
[14:02:55] <chovy> CWSpear: i don't want to use bootstrap
[14:02:57] <Rya> Isn't it a trademark on a name, and patent is a technique? (I don't know american law though.. but that's how UK is afaik?)
[14:02:59] <CWSpear> I bet jQuery UI's can be toggled on click, too, which would allow you to click on links in them
[14:05:01] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, I can't seem to find that method o.O getStorage()
[14:05:17] <Rya> toddWork: you're calling the ajax within the setTimeout, you want to wrap the ajaxGoogle(key, terms) in a closure, i.e. function() { ..stuff..}
[14:05:17] <CWSpear> isn't it getItem()?
[14:05:29] <CWSpear> are we not still talking about localStorage? lol
[14:05:53] <CWSpear> chovy, you could use jQuery UI's tooltip and not bind it to what you want to have a tooltip, but bind a click that opens the tooltip manually?
[14:06:14] <Rya> toddWork: also, you should check setInterval instead of setTimeout if you plan to make it every 3seconds, but you'd be best to wait until hearing a response from the previous one before firing a new ajax call.. but do what you want :P
[14:06:55] <CWSpear> Foxhoundz, I don't know about the patten thing. I just think it's interesting that everyone knows the gesture, but it doesn't have a name, and not many people have really thought about it, so funny responses ensue.
[14:07:08] <toddWork> Rya: oh. use the callback from the ajax and put assign that to setInterval?
[14:07:21] <CWSpear> patent* lol
[14:08:36] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  I have to apologize it is localStorage.getItem(); I think I made some custom methods called getLocalStorage();
[14:08:57] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  Are you having problems getting to the data offline?
[14:09:20] <Nytician> yeah I have assign origin issues when trying to get my  json file
[14:09:24] <Nytician> on chrome especially
[14:09:52] <Rya> toddWork: not sure what asking, but I'd call setTimeout on the completion of the ajax (success or failure, unless you want to handle failure different)
[14:09:59] <CWSpear> nchlssmith1, Nytician: yeah, I have a set of methods I usually use like, "getObject()" and stuff that will do the de/serialization and some simple caching for me so it's easier to manipulate an object, etc.
[14:10:06] <CWSpear> and so it will return {} instead of null
[14:10:09] <CWSpear> stuff like that
[14:10:21] <nchlssmith1> So the user is in the browser and there is not internet connetion. and you can't get to the local storage?
[14:10:22] <Nytician> oh ok
[14:10:22] <toddWork> Rya: i get what you're saying, but how do i get the next result in the for in loop?
[14:10:45] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  Just trying to make sure I understand.
[14:10:45] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, no the idea is to run the game from the browser but with no internet connection needed
[14:11:06] <Nytician> just like any standalone game, im not planning to set up a sever to run the game on
[14:11:40] <MrPunkin> nchlssmith1: So what happens if someone accesses an intermediate page for your app directly by URL, what does going 'back' do for them using your stored history?
[14:11:43] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  I don't understand why you can't get to the localstorage.  I know that it works even off line
[14:12:47] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, huh its the $.get(bla bla) that doesn't work. I havem't tried localstorage.getItem() yet
[14:13:14] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  Ohh, I am pretty sure that the local storage is tied to your site.
[14:13:30] <Nytician> oh
[14:13:32] <brainwarped_m> My server generates "options" for a multiple select box like "<select multiple="multiple class="filtered" name="term_old" id="id_term_from"> <option value="9266" data-tree-id="1" data=left-value="1">My first node</option>". Is there an accordion widget I can use to tame this? I have a script that prepends text to each node with a variable, level_indicator=u'-', but I want an accordion effect.
[14:13:32] <brainwarped_m> Any ideas?
[14:13:33] <Rya> toddWork: you're not going to have the results due to the async nature of this stuff, simplest thing you could do is onsuccess: function(data) { ‚Ä¶ if (newLangaugeDictionary.length == desiredLength) { doSomethingWithDict() } }
[14:13:34] <Nytician> no I have no site :P
[14:13:54] <brainwarped_m> I'm looking at the accordion widget right now...
[14:13:56] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  That wont work, sorry.
[14:14:19] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, theres no way to create an offline html5 game?
[14:14:45] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  Maybe if you have an html page that they go to.
[14:14:52] <nchlssmith1> like in a folder.
[14:15:08] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  But I have never tried do that.
[14:15:13] <toddWork> ok. thanks Rya
[14:15:21] <Nytician> im thinking its going to be less problematic to set this up online lol
[14:15:36] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  I agree with that. =)
[14:15:52] <Rya> Nytician: you could try embedding your json into scripts, they should be loaded ok I think?
[14:15:57] <Nytician> so that extends to the next question Im assuming you don't save data into files when you do this, rather you use mysql maybe?
[14:16:24] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  But you can use advanced Caching features to play offline.
[14:16:30] <Nytician> rya ahh ok but this would be a problem when I have a json file for each map, more and more and more files embedded :D
[14:16:56] <nchlssmith1> Nytician:  Depends on the data being stored
[14:17:16] <nchlssmith1> For small amounts of data local storage is great.
[14:17:25] <chovy> CWSpear: ok, thanks
[14:17:39] <chovy> i'm just wanting something light weight, would rather avoid loading jquery-ui
[14:18:37] <CWSpear> chovy, make your own
[14:18:48] <CWSpear> the JS part of it is very simple. The hard part is the CSS
[14:18:57] <CWSpear> so depending on your skill...
[14:19:59] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, yeah I think i'll do it online it wont be an issue actually, could make it more fun just need to find a good host then
[14:20:05] <MrPunkin> Nytician: you can bundle local HTML5 sites into true apps with something like PhoneGap or whatnot
[14:21:23] <nchlssmith1> Nytician: I use hostgator  I have never heard of PhoneGap, Ill have to check it out.
[14:21:25] <Nytician> hmmm good to keep in mind thanks @ MrPunkin, will probably just make it online at this rate to save the headache and its going to be single player so if I want to provide offline in future I can
[14:21:34] <Rya> Nytician: could just develop offline using a locally hosted http server, and bundle it when needed, e.g. phone gap, or appify(mac) .. or other stuff on windows
[14:21:36] <Nytician> nchlssmith1, hostgator is the one im looking at using yes
[14:22:16] <Nytician> rya ty ;)
[14:22:39] <MrPunkin> Nytician, nchlssmith1 I believe PhoneGap is based around Cordova: http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/
[14:23:05] <CWSpear> PhoneGap is Cordova. Adobe bought it and named the "core" Cordova, but it's pretty much a fused project.
[14:23:55] <Rya> They've got a pretty lovely website either way!
[14:24:26] <MrPunkin> I agree Rya
[14:24:39] <Bash> Hey guys, I'm in need of some help. http://jsfiddle.net/DydR3/ <- i need to make each article change colour by pressing the "coloured buttons" in the bottom right. Currently pressing the buttons changes all article colours
[14:24:44] <Bash> any help would be appreciated
[14:24:57] <Bash> also a bit of a noob at this :)
[14:26:02] <nchlssmith1> MrPunkin: It looks cool Ill have to give it a try.
[14:26:03] <CWSpear> I think PhoneGap is like a packaged version of Cordova. I would recommend going to PhoneGap as it has stuff to help you get started and all that.
[14:26:55] <MrPunkin> Right
[14:27:10] <CWSpear> Bash, $('p'
[14:27:12] <CWSpear> )
[14:27:21] <CWSpear> matches all paragraphs
[14:27:24] <CWSpear> sorry about that
[14:27:43] <CWSpear> So you have to find a way to just target the ones you want to select. The easiest way is with a little traversal
[14:27:47] <chovy> CWSpear: i will make my own i think
[14:27:58] <stefanju_> @bash you could look into the event, that is given you at the clickhandler
[14:28:10] <stefanju_> -> $(".blue").click(function(event){
[14:28:28] <CWSpear> stefanju_, he has that
[14:28:51] <stefanju_> he's not using the event.
[14:28:53] <stefanju_> ;)
[14:29:06] <CWSpear> gotcha
[14:29:21] <CWSpear> if you get a class to each individual area you want to change color, then you could target them via .closest (which is the closest parent of something)
[14:29:58] <MrPunkin> he could simply use $(this) within the context of the triggered function, right?
[14:30:08] <CWSpear> For example, give #left and #right a class of 'color-changer' in the HTML, and target in the $('blue').click() via $(this).closest('.color-changer').find('p').color('blue');
[14:30:32] <stefanju_> $(this) is even better :)
[14:31:22] <CWSpear> Base, for example: http://jsfiddle.net/DydR3/2/
[14:31:33] <firstclassfunc> how do I monitor the value of an input field that can be set by other programs?
[14:31:56] <nchlssmith1> onchange function
[14:32:23] <CWSpear> Bash, I mean. That jsfiddle was for you.
[14:32:24] <Bash123> what would be the most efficient way? or is there no real performance issues
[14:32:33] <Bash123> i realised CWSpear and thanks
[14:32:53] <CWSpear> Performance isn't an issue on something this small, but you could write it with less code that could make it easier to manage
[14:32:57] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: that will work if user changes the input. what if my program changes it? I don't think it'll fire
[14:33:18] <nchlssmith1> Well it should fire anytime anything changes it.
[14:34:20] <Bash123> ok CWSpear i will look into it and thanks for everyone elses help
[14:34:40] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: nope, it doesn't
[14:34:56] <nchlssmith1> can you show me your onchange function?
[14:35:03] <Bash123> oh and before i go would anyone recommend good basic tutorial websites?
[14:35:24] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: one second
[14:36:33] <Rya> the jQuery documentation pages are actually a genuine resource to read :)
[14:37:57] <Bash123> ok guys appreciate the help
[14:37:59] <Bash123> :)
[14:38:06] <Bash123> good bye
[14:38:52] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: http://jsfiddle.net/mQ6LM/3/
[14:40:24] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: I thought maybe we were on the same page but I guess it doesn't work.
[14:40:45] <nchlssmith1> *not on the same page
[14:42:27] <stefanju_> nchlssmith1 i thought i would work this way, too. :P
[14:42:54] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: try addind a document.ready function because I just go it to work I think.
[14:43:02] <Foxhoundz> back
[14:43:31] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: post the jsfiddle if you get it working
[14:43:46] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: Ill try I am new to Jfiddle.
[14:44:15] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: id="details"
[14:44:30] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/mQ6LM/4/
[14:45:54] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/mQ6LM/7/
[14:47:04] <stefanju_> nchlssmith1: alert doesn't show up after pressing the button here...
[14:47:27] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: yeah, your syntax was wrong it looks like
[14:47:59] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: the apply the onchange to the button
[14:48:25] <firstclassfunc> putting it inside document ready doesn't do anything as far as I can tell
[14:48:26] <ideaprison> Hi all, im trying to stop the page from scroll while scroll on a div http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/NgmEJ/8/ bit of an odd demo but as you can see you can flip through the albums but i want to stop the page from scrolling when you do so, made a weird attempt already you can ignore that
[14:48:50] <ideaprison> solutions welcome
[14:48:55] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: the onchange is applied to the input box which fires a alert everytime it is changed. either by the user or the machine.
[14:49:30] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: I believe it only works when changed by a user, otherwise it does't work
[14:49:38] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: I see what you are saying
[14:49:41] <zfly9> Hey guys I have the same slider and almost identical site at http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and http://67.225.219.106/ the slider will be black every once in a while and will take a couple hard refreshes for it to come back, is there anyway to stop this before I go live?
[14:49:43] <zfly9> ... actually hard refresh doesn't work a lot of the times, clicking the logo (going to home page) will get it to reappear
[14:50:17] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: Yeah that doesn't make any sense.
[14:51:11] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: sorry, what doesn't make any sense?
[14:51:28] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: the js functionality.
[14:51:47] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: I guess that event only acts on events from the user
[14:54:14] <firstclassfunc> yeah must be
[14:55:31] <therealklanni> ?test
[14:55:32] <bot-t> therealklanni, jQuery.isFunction() - Determine if the argument passed is a Javascript function object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[14:55:51] <nchlssmith1> firstclassfunc: You could poll the element every so often to see if the value changed.
[14:57:21] <firstclassfunc> nchlssmith1: yeah I know, was looking for a library that does this already
[14:57:43] <nchlssmith1> Like twisted for javascript =)
[14:59:06] <CWSpear> so Halloween‚Ä¶ http://instagram.com/p/RUDwqdQgov/
[15:01:08] <stefanju_> firstclassfunc: you could trigger the event by yourself
[15:01:10] <stefanju_> $("button").click(function() { $("input").focus().val("100").change(); } );
[15:01:30] <greg0> Hey guys.  http://jsfiddle.net/78XmY/ .  I have a problem.  When I click submit I don't get any alerts.  If I get rid of preventDefault or return true I'll get an alert but it submits the form twice
[15:03:20] <firstclassfunc> stefanju_: yeah that's true, thanks for the reminder
[15:04:19] <nchlssmith1> greg0: I assuming your talking about the Got Data alert.  You are getting a 404 error on your ajax so the success callback is not firing.
[15:04:40] <greg0> Well, I copied that from my server
[15:05:05] <nchlssmith1> greg0: I can tell its a relative link.
[15:05:19] <greg0> It works, it's got access to the .php script, but it seems my options are either submit twice or no alerts
[15:06:05] <nchlssmith1> greg0: ohh your talking about the thank you alerts.
[15:07:18] <greg0> yes
[15:07:19] <greg0> sorry
[15:08:16] <nchlssmith1> greg0: try the beforeSend ajax callback.
[15:08:27] <nchlssmith1> but the alert there
[15:08:43] <nchlssmith1> greg0: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:10:48] <tyoc213> in an event handler, I send "this" so for get the value of the input I use this.value instead of this.val(), how can I convert "this" to a this accesible via "val()" jquery call?
[15:11:35] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:12:27] <johnkpaul> tyoc213: $(this).val()
[15:14:01] <tyoc213> johnkpaul: thx
[15:14:09] <greg0> ok
[15:14:10] <johnkpaul> tyoc213: np
[15:14:19] <greg0> why does adding beforeSend break the mobiwheel ?
[15:18:20] <vacho> guys
[15:18:21] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/5qSGNXH7
[15:18:39] <vacho> how can I make that work?? it does not work because the content is loaded with an ajax call..how do I rewrite it into live?
[15:20:01] <vacho> might be an ajpiano question :)
[15:21:38] <johnkpaul> vacho: live doesn't run anything when new elements are added
[15:21:50] <vacho> johnkpaul: do you get my problem?
[15:21:52] <johnkpaul> live just lets an event propagate to some parent node
[15:22:03] <johnkpaul> vacho: yes, but there's nothing natively jquery can do to help
[15:22:23] <johnkpaul> you can look into livequery, which I think gives you a callback for adding to the dom
[15:22:54] <johnkpaul> vacho: why not add this logic where new elements are added?
[15:22:56] <johnkpaul> after your ajax call
[15:31:04] <vacho> johnkpaul: I don't know where the ajax is made/
[15:43:21] <p4ch0> I'm having an issue with tabs ... demo here: http://intranet.felinux.com.co/jui19/index.htm ....
[15:48:44] <chare> Why doesn't jquery support components
[15:48:53] <chare> why isn't jquery like this https://github.com/mythz/jquip
[15:51:02] <gnarf> chare: because we haven't gotten there yet?
[15:51:09] <gnarf> chare: you here to troll us again today?
[15:51:24] <chare> gnarf: so you haven't gotten there but some random guy did?
[15:51:37] <gnarf> chare: yup
[15:52:06] <chare> so jquery team is always slow?
[15:52:10] <ryanneufeld> chare: patches are welcome. Please make a pull request or STFU
[15:52:37] <javalover> hi so I get this error on my perfectly running code for firefox
[15:52:43] <gnarf> chare: yes, we are snails
[15:52:45] <javalover> if i run it in explorer it's like "error"
[15:53:21] <javalover> oh ic i can click on the error
[15:54:02] <gnarf> chare: actually, looks like 4 random people to me (judging by commit/contributors)
[15:55:33] <javalover> so it says object expected but all i see is </div>
[15:58:59] <gnarf> javalover: not sure what any of that is meaning
[16:00:55] <javalover> basically
[16:01:00] <gnarf> chare: so when are you gonna tell me some project you've worked on?
[16:01:03] <javalover> firefox runs smooth but exploreer has errors
[16:01:13] <gnarf> javalover: welcome to web development
[16:01:13] <javalover> and i'm now figuring out what these all mean by clicking on them
[16:01:17] <gnarf> use a debugger
[16:01:20] <javalover> yeah explorer suckssssssssssssssssssss
[16:01:44] <javalover> but i think firefox just ignores certain errors
[16:01:47] <javalover> like an empty </div>
[16:01:47] <gnarf> explorer is also responsible for some of the biggest leaps in innovation in the web/js object models
[16:02:10] <gnarf> it's also a pain to debug in
[16:02:10] <javalover> maybe idk history
[16:02:17] <gnarf> try with IE8+
[16:02:26] <gnarf> and use the "F12 debugger" or whatever that crap is called
[16:03:43] <javalover> and what are we going to do tonight pinky?
[16:04:10] <chare> so gnarf we agree that jquery is bloated for mobile phones that don't have a fast connection
[16:05:16] <gnarf> chare: use what suits you best, if you have the time to research tinier libraries, enjoy
[16:05:29] <gnarf> ill continue to use my little jQuery
[16:05:46] <coldhead> i heard zepto is a complete drop in replacement for jQuery
[16:05:46] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[16:05:50] <gnarf> because its smaller than most images served on webpages which seem to load just fine on my mobile device with slow connections
[16:05:51] <coldhead> except smaller and better
[16:06:14] <p4ch0> I'm having an strange behaviour with tabs in UI 1.9.1 on Firefox and Chorome.. demo here: http://intranet.felinux.com.co/jui19/index.htm
[16:07:29] <joshsmith> I'm trying to do an image drag and drop to an element, which works fine, but I want to change a hidden input to the file I received with the FileReader API. Anyone know how I can do that?
[16:07:35] <gnarf> chare: please go troll some other project, or like, take the time to be proactive and support the efforts of making it right --- What I don't understand is why you're here in the first place?  You came in a few days ago talking about "bloat" - If you don't like it, don't use it, and stop clogging up a channel where people who use it get support.  kthxbye
[16:08:21] <javalover> well'
[16:08:36] <javalover> aside from trolling, I have this f12 debugger open
[16:08:55] <javalover> looks like firebug but i don't know how to use it
[16:08:57] <ryanneufeld> chare: I don't see where you and gnarf agreed on anything...
[16:09:18] <gnarf> javalover: so - debugging is an artform - one that is very hard to explain via text
[16:09:22] <gnarf> javalover: see ?ftj
[16:09:23] <bot-t> javalover, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:09:31] <gnarf> javalover: there are some tips in there
[16:09:43] <gnarf> javalover: but really, its just practice that makes you better at it
[16:09:53] <javalover> wtf
[16:09:57] <javalover> 404
[16:10:15] <gnarf> javalover: worksforme?
[16:11:03] <javalover> oh lol
[16:11:10] <javalover> somehow my upload failed
[16:11:14] <javalover> that scared the shit out of me lol
[16:11:48] <javalover> i'm like "if my site is gone I sware!!"
[16:13:12] <javalover> oh ic so I click on script & it shows me the errors woohoo I can fix this
[16:13:55] <joshsmith> I'm trying to do an image drag and drop to an element, which works fine, but I want to change a hidden input to the file I received with the FileReader API. Anyone know how I can do that?

[16:16:52] <foofoobar> Hi. I have an list with some <li><a href="#" rel="1">Foo</a></li> <li><a href="#" rel="2">Bar</a></li> ‚Ä¶ in it. I'm binding for the 'li a'.click() which works great so I can get $(this).rel to get the "id" for the corresponding text.
[16:16:58] <javalover> add action event to drag and drop?
[16:17:04] <foofoobar> THe problem is that because of the href="#" every time I click the page jumps to the top
[16:17:22] <javalover> do href=""
[16:17:28] <foofoobar> then the page reloads
[16:17:28] <javalover> or href="javascript:void(0)"
[16:17:40] <knes> Hi, I have a question. I clone a table using $('#table').clone() and store it in a variable "cloned" How can I loop through each row with each() on this "object"?
[16:18:14] <coldhead> $clone.find('tr').each()
[16:18:15] <gnarf> foofoobar: I would suggest using data-rel="1"
[16:18:20] <javalover> in fact foofoobar javascript:void(0); was invented for that case
[16:18:29] <gnarf> foofoobar: in which case $(element).data('rel') === 1
[16:18:32] <gnarf> foofoobar: otherwise
[16:18:34] <knes> @coldhead going to try that. Thx
[16:18:35] <gnarf> you could read the attr
[16:18:46] <gnarf> foofoobar: $(element).attr('rel') === "1"
[16:18:55] <gnarf> ?attr @foofoobar
[16:18:55] <bot-t> foofoobar, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[16:18:57] <gnarf> ?data @foofoobar
[16:18:57] <bot-t> foofoobar, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:19:24] <gnarf> the reason i suggest the data-* attribs is that "rel" has a meaning that doesn't accept the value "1" :)
[16:19:44] <gnarf> the data-* attribs are like open hunting season - use whatever you want whenever you want
[16:19:45] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try following but the alert shows me "undefined" : $('#testiframe').attr('src',"testscript.php"); alert($('#testiframe').attr('src'));
[16:19:54] <joshsmith> javalover: apparently FileList is a readonly object, so I *can't* change the file input based on it
[16:19:58] <foofoobar> all right, thank you
[16:20:18] <gnarf> foofoobar: href="#" btw
[16:20:39] <gnarf> if you event.preventDefault() the click event, won't navigate to the top of the page
[16:21:19] <foofoobar> ah, good to know
[16:21:20] <gnarf> and javalover: "javascript:void(0);" is a terrible HREF - it hasn't been anyones "best-practice" in years
[16:21:21] <foofoobar> thank you
[16:21:51] <gnarf> javalover: in fact it's on several "terrible" lists instead of "best-practice" lists
[16:22:13] <gnarf> javascript: url's in general are just bad practice
[16:22:22] <gnarf> unless you're making a bookmarklet for yourself
[16:24:15] <foofoobar> gnarf: can I put this data-rel attribute also on an li element?
[16:24:21] <foofoobar> then I could remove the <a>
[16:24:29] <gnarf> foofoobar: yup
[16:24:39] <gnarf> foofoobar: the beauty of data-* attribs
[16:24:41] <foofoobar> and what is the more logic what to do this?
[16:24:52] <foofoobar> I have a list where the user should select some items from
[16:24:55] <gnarf> foofoobar: you might want to use CSS to make the cursor:pointer tho so it looks clickable
[16:25:01] <foofoobar> i don't want to use a <select> for this
[16:28:05] <gnarf> foofoobar: http://jsfiddle.net/z9j9N/
[16:29:52] <foofoobar> gnarf: but I missed that I have to realize a :hover css style now via javascript right?
[16:30:04] <foofoobar> for the li element
[16:30:15] <gnarf> why?
[16:30:18] <gnarf> just use :hover in css
[16:30:22] <foofoobar> for the li?
[16:30:29] <foofoobar> i thought this only works on a:hover
[16:31:49] <gnarf> foofoobar: http://jsfiddle.net/z9j9N/1/
[16:32:11] <gnarf> foofoobar: some older browsers don't support :hover well, but you should have support for all that in IE8+
[16:32:16] <foofoobar> gnarf: oh, okay
[16:32:19] <gnarf> `g caniuse hover
[16:32:19] <b-ot> gnarf, css - Can I use hover for div? - Stack Overflow ‚Üí http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5394148/can-i-use-hover-for-div
[16:32:20] <foofoobar> good to know, thank you
[16:32:39] <gnarf> http://caniuse.com/#search=%3Ahover
[16:34:16] <foofoobar> gnarf: okay, I see there is a support from IE7
[16:34:18] <foofoobar> thats okay
[16:39:33] <knes> is there an equivalent to python list in javascript / jquery ? So I can store some data
[16:42:38] <foofoobar> gnarf: when calling .data('del') I get:
[16:42:48] <foofoobar> HTMLLIElement has no method 'data'
[16:43:12] <foofoobar> "Object #HTMLLIElement has no method 'data'"
[16:45:54] <xboi209> guys just a quick javascript/regex question, what's the difference between if(/test.html/i.url(location.href)){ and if(location.href=="test.html"){
[16:46:20] <xboi209> they're both supposed to check the page you're on then run a code but is there any speed differences?
[16:47:51] <razzi> xboi209, did you mean .test() instead of .url()?
[16:48:11] <xboi209> oh yeah
[16:48:12] <xboi209> test
[16:48:16] <razzi> xboi209, as a general rule regular expressions are always slower than simple string compare.
[16:48:35] <xboi209> ok any advantages does it hold?
[16:48:40] <xboi209> I know for one that it allows a wildcard
[16:50:07] <razzi> xboi209, for the examples you posted the second one checks for an *exact* match, the first one checks if 'test.html' is a substring without being case-sensitive
[16:50:49] <razzi> ie, 'blahTeSt.HTML' would give a match too.
[16:50:56] <xboi209> oh
[16:51:21] <xboi209> i see
[16:51:22] <xboi209> thanks
[16:51:35] <razzi> yw
[16:52:10] <foofoobar> strange
[16:52:22] <foofoobar> v is my complete <li> element (with has a data-rel="1")
[16:52:35] <foofoobar> but v.data('rel') is not accessible
[17:01:50] <Foxhoundz> Good god I love jQuery
[17:01:58] * Foxhoundz hugs the developers
[17:02:03] * Foxhoundz goes back to coding
[17:15:30] <[1]javalover> ok wtf explorerr!!!
[17:15:33] <[1]javalover> function makeReservation(action,postid,reservationdata){
[17:15:33] <[1]javalover> }
[17:15:39] <[1]javalover> this is somehow a problem!??!!
[17:16:48] <SpeedTheory> what.
[17:18:41] <niggler> muimi: you here?
[17:20:08] <[1]javalover> guys this is so frustrating it says "Object doesn't support this property or method"
[17:20:14] <[1]javalover> it's a freaking empty function wtf
[17:20:34] <niggler> you need to give some code [1]javalover
[17:21:03] <SpeedTheory> How in the world are we supposed to have any idea what you are talking about
[17:21:12] <SpeedTheory> Also, what is "it"?
[17:21:37] <goddard> im trying to have an open all function for this nested accordion like plugin can anyone help? http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/nested_accordion.html
[17:21:42] <[1]javalover> function makeReservation(a,p,r){}
[17:21:55] <[1]javalover> explorer for whatever reason hates this
[17:22:53] <SpeedTheory> what is the context?
[17:23:20] <[1]javalover> there is none, idk man my site works in firefox & I just loaded to explorer & i have like 9 bugs
[17:23:29] <SpeedTheory> ...
[17:23:47] <SpeedTheory> link?
[17:23:57] <tw2113> IE hates everything
[17:24:04] <[1]javalover> and now it spit out the same error after deleting the function
[17:24:06] <tw2113> if only it was emo and hated itself
[17:24:42] <[1]javalover> i think it must be a problem elsewhere which causes everything to break
[17:24:44] <SpeedTheory> Do you have a JS function with the same name as an element on the page?
[17:24:59] <[1]javalover> uhhhhhh possibly?
[17:25:14] <SpeedTheory> Did you not google this problem before you asked in here?
[17:25:32] <[1]javalover> uhhhhhh possibly
[17:25:47] <SpeedTheory> This is a known IE issue.
[17:26:09] <SpeedTheory> For future reference, try to do some general googling + debugging on your own.
[17:26:10] <SpeedTheory> You
[17:26:18] <SpeedTheory> will learn a lot more that way than getting spoon-fed :)
[17:26:50] <tw2113> wouldn't that be spoonfeeding yourself?
[17:27:21] <SpeedTheory> Googling for a hint and debugging yourself?
[17:27:34] <SpeedTheory> Rather than coming in here with an ambiguous "THIS DOESNT WORK!" with no context?
[17:27:44] <tw2113> yeah
[17:27:52] <tw2113> or just researching on your own about anything
[17:28:15] <tw2113> taking to a mirror "hear comes the spoon-plane vrrrrrrm"
[17:28:18] <tw2113> talking*
[17:28:23] <SpeedTheory> ....
[17:28:40] <tw2113> :)
[17:28:59] <tw2113> i'm surprised at how much fun i had typing that
[17:29:55] <SpeedTheory> I'm surprised too.
[17:30:11] <shoky> i'm appalled
[17:30:15] <tw2113> and you don't even know the half of it
[17:30:23] <tw2113> oh shoky
[17:30:29] <shoky> oh mannn
[17:31:17] <CodesStuff> Oh yay. Made my first sale on gramblr lol.
[17:31:26] <CodesStuff> (the best part is it's 100% free)
[17:34:43] <mdedetrich> hi everybody!
[17:35:04] <SpeedTheory> Hello.
[17:35:14] <CodesStuff> oops
[17:35:15] <CodesStuff> wrong channel
[17:35:16] <CodesStuff> lmao
[17:36:31] <[1]javalover> um so explorer is having trouble compiling my jquery lol
[17:37:09] <SpeedTheory> You don't compile Javascript.
[17:37:31] <[1]javalover> ok well it has an error in reading the jquery file i have
[17:38:06] <[1]javalover> jquery-1.7.1.min.js   and my error is 80020101
[17:41:42] <[1]javalover> hmm is it possible I could be calling jquery too many times?
[17:50:26] <jonkri> a little bit of a generic javascript question here if no one minds: any idea why i get "TypeError: digitsStr is undefined @ http://localhost/temp/bigint.js:1087" for this file? http://hpaste.org/76959 - i'm just calling the str2bigInt function
[17:56:50] <javalover> hi
[17:57:01] <javalover> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9221  <-- that's the error I have can someone explain this?
[17:58:10] <danheberden> the fact that you're hitting this error is alarming - why on earth would you have app architecture that runs scripts in arbitrarily loaded content
[17:58:36] <javalover> umm i'm not sure really i'm trying to figure out my own error
[17:59:07] <danheberden> are you using jQuery 1.8.2?
[17:59:10] <javalover> so at one point I used ajax to load stuff
[17:59:15] <sinusss> hi all http://pastie.org/5135240 I need to be able to call the loadContent() function via onclick="loadContent('http://blah.com')"
[17:59:19] <sinusss> how would I do that?
[17:59:23] <javalover> then I switched over to .load
[17:59:27] <sinusss> loadContent is not defined
[17:59:48] <javalover> but the function remains in my code & I take it that is the issue i'm just not sure cuz firefox seems to not care
[17:59:51] <javalover> but explorer does?
[18:01:31] <javalover> it can't be though
[18:01:39] <javalover> cuz i just deleted the function & I get same error
[18:01:54] <javalover> Could not complete the operation due to error 80020101.
[18:20:24] <javalover> stackoverflow IS OFFLINE!!!
[18:21:15] <alexnet> OMG
[18:22:04] <alexnet> sandy hurricane take stackoverflow
[18:25:25] <niggler> SO isn't the worst thing in the world
[18:25:30] <niggler> its a honeypot of sors
[18:25:32] <niggler> *sorts
[18:26:11] <razzi> why are people so eager to answer questions there?
[18:26:18] <razzi> do they gain something from it?
[18:26:27] <Foxhoundz> Satisfaction
[18:26:30] <Foxhoundz> knowledge
[18:26:31] <Foxhoundz> insight
[18:26:35] <Foxhoundz> new perspective
[18:26:36] <Foxhoundz> :|
[18:27:05] <razzi> weird
[18:27:35] <danheberden> what's weirder is those that want to give back for all the time they have saved because of someone _else_ giving of their time freely
[18:27:57] <eph3meral> how I drive car?
[18:28:34] <razzi> it's weird because it's helping your competition
[18:28:59] <alexnet> weird can be good
[18:29:35] <razzi> in this cae, in what way?
[18:29:43] <danheberden> given the amount of under-qualified developers out there, razzi, it's only helping the industry
[18:30:01] <danheberden> increasing production, increasing advancements
[18:30:55] <danheberden> the company I work for does an incredible amount of work that's open-source, along with companies that do a lot of open-source
[18:31:17] <danheberden> and we all still get paychecks :)
[18:34:38] <eph3meral> razzi: why are you here? weren't you doing this yesterday?
[18:36:57] <razzi> doing what?
[18:37:22] * eph3meral gives razzi a cookie
[18:38:21] <razzi> well?
[18:42:03] <grafi> trolling ;)
[18:54:17] <mdedetrich> what is the easiest way to change the text using .text() without actually altering any HTML tags that might exist
[18:57:27] <acidjazz> whats the most efficient way to reach an inner element of $(this) .. lets say its an <input>
[18:57:35] <acidjazz> $(this).children('input') ? what if i know its only one
[19:10:33] <Muimi> do you guys know a good guide to ajax-php-jquery?
[19:10:47] <Muimi> the manual pages all suck because they don't take into account the other languages.
[19:11:03] <Muimi> so i'm looking for something that works for all 3 languages.
[19:11:43] <niggler> ajax isn't a language
[19:13:04] <Muimi> *sigh*
[19:13:30] <Muimi> looking for someone who has an answer, niggler.
[19:13:59] <Muimi> night
[19:14:00] <niggler> the niggler niggles
[19:14:09] <niggler> ajax is provided by jquery
[19:14:15] <Muimi> niggler stop man
[19:14:18] <niggler> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:14:32] <niggler> that eliminates one of the three "languages" in your list
[19:14:35] <Muimi> you can't give a full answer, and I know that.
[19:14:55] <Muimi> don't fool people who might be able to answer into thinking that you can handle the question.
[19:14:58] <niggler> if you get rid of ajax
[19:15:03] <niggler> and then you search for php jquery
[19:15:09] <niggler> the *first* entry is a tutorial
[19:15:39] <Muimi> you're showing the man page that I just disqualified from answers.
[19:15:55] <niggler> "do you guys know a good guide to ajax-php-jquery?"
[19:16:02] <Muimi> tell you what... go do the tutorial on the site you just posted, and when you're successful at doing it, then come back and paste it....
[19:16:07] <niggler> "he manual pages all suck because they don't take into account the other languages."
[19:16:10] <Muimi> then you can answer questions about the code, too.
[19:16:29] <niggler> what is the application on that page?
[19:16:46] <Muimi> That doesnt' speak to the issue, niggler.  You're pasting links that you yourself can't use.
[19:16:48] <niggler> i.e. did you even look at it
[19:16:54] <Muimi> yes, obviously.
[19:16:56] <niggler> http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-jquery-ajax/index.html
[19:17:03] <Muimi> you posted the same link in ##javascript and then told me to move my question here.
[19:17:11] <Muimi> don't just paste another link, man.
[19:17:11] <niggler> i didn't post that link
[19:17:15] <Muimi> Learn how to do it, then post links.
[19:17:17] <niggler> the link i originally posted was the query documentation
[19:17:19] <Muimi> in order
[19:17:20] <niggler> *jquery doc
[19:17:22] <niggler> did you read it?
[19:17:28] <Muimi> You can't have learned how to do it in 5 seconds.  I'm not going to bro
[19:17:33] <Muimi> You can't use it, it's a useless answer.
[19:17:39] <niggler> the nature of your question suggests you don't even understand that ajax isn't a language
[19:17:49] <niggler> and if we can't get past that stage, its harder to go into other stuff
[19:17:52] <Muimi> it doesn't matter.
[19:18:00] <Muimi> what matters is that you can't answer it.
[19:18:08] <Muimi> how do you know?
[19:18:16] <Muimi> you can't do it yourself, so you don't know what it takes to do it.
[19:18:19] <niggler> your html was *fraught with issues
[19:18:28] <niggler> so you should start a bit further back
[19:18:30] <Muimi> bro, just shut up.
[19:18:37] <Muimi> Nothing you say is helpful.
[19:18:39] <niggler> :)
[19:18:45] <Muimi> seriously
[19:18:52] <Muimi> you're really a leech on the channel.
[19:19:03] <niggler> you actually have to try something first
[19:19:05] <Muimi> people come in with questions, you act like you're intelligent and you know what you're doing, but in the end you can't make things tick.
[19:19:07] <niggler> and get past the small problems
[19:19:13] <Muimi> okay, then how do i get past you
[19:19:14] <Muimi> go away
[19:19:17] <niggler> then you can actually address larger issues
[19:19:21] <Muimi> how do you know?
[19:19:23] <Muimi> same question
[19:19:29] <niggler> this shouldn't be the first place you go
[19:19:35] <Muimi> when you can confront that question instead of moving to something else, then talk to me.
[19:19:45] <Muimi> How do you know?
[19:19:50] <niggler> you showed some code, there were obvious html issues first
[19:19:54] <niggler> then you forgot to include jquery
[19:19:58] <Muimi> blah blah blah
[19:20:01] <Muimi> that's all i hear from you
[19:20:03] <Muimi> bunch of bullshit
[19:20:06] <Muimi> in the end, you can't do it.
[19:20:10] <niggler> and if that's your level of sophistication you have rot start from the basics
[19:20:13] <niggler> simple as that
[19:20:17] <Muimi> nothing you say is relevant at all or matters in the least.
[19:20:24] <Muimi> stop talking, you're not an authority.
[19:20:25] <abjorn> :|
[19:20:26] <niggler> it is relevant, given that this was the first issues we accounted
[19:20:31] <Muimi> it's not relevant.
[19:20:42] <abjorn> imsky, what has happened to my #jquery
[19:20:43] <Muimi> You don't knwo what you're doing.
[19:20:55] <abjorn> Muimi what is your question
[19:21:07] <Muimi> niggler's trolling questions with man page posts that he doesn't know how to use.
[19:21:08] <niggler> abjorn: Muimi had some issues which seemed to boil down to his lack of understand of query selectors
[19:21:18] <Muimi> how do you know?
[19:21:19] <abjorn> well
[19:21:20] <niggler> and in trying to explain them Muimi rejected my explanation
[19:21:22] <abjorn> then help him understand
[19:21:23] <niggler> and here we are
[19:21:26] <Muimi> in the first place, you told me the wrong info about the selector
[19:21:30] <Muimi> ("submit") is correct.
[19:21:40] <Muimi> he doesn't know, abjorn.  he's trolling.
[19:21:51] <niggler> its not 'button" which is what you originally had
[19:21:57] <niggler> even though there was no "button"
[19:22:04] <Muimi> "submit" and "button" both work
[19:22:24] <coldhead> guys is everything okay?
[19:22:25] <niggler> where's the original paste
[19:22:29] <coldhead> asking for a friend
[19:22:44] <Muimi> it's been removed for the time limit expiration
[19:22:50] <niggler> lol brilliant
[19:23:00] <niggler> alas this discussion is going nowhere
[19:23:05] <Muimi> shut up you don't know what brilliant is.
[19:23:11] <Muimi> you can't do anything except troll answers
[19:23:15] <abjorn> bros

[19:23:22] <Muimi> then tell him to fucking leave me alone
[19:23:31] <Muimi> i don't want his bs answers they're totally useless and often wrong
[19:23:48] <niggler> apparently including the jquery script is "bs answer"
[19:23:52] <niggler> which is why this discussion goes nowhere
[19:23:57] <abjorn> :|
[19:23:57] <Muimi> STOP tyring to asnswer my question you can't fucking do it yourself
[19:24:20] <niggler> abjorn: lol the first paste omitted quite a few things, which suggested that Muimi lacked basic understanding of html :/
[19:24:27] <niggler> but its pointless
[19:24:50] <razzi> kewl a fight
[19:24:52] <Muimi> good ridance
[19:25:50] <abjorn> oooookay
[19:26:23] <Muimi> whatever he means well
[19:26:32] <Muimi> he just answers like 20 or 30 questions in a row with bad answers
[19:26:41] <Muimi> and all the power users disappear
[19:27:16] <razzi> power users?
[19:28:43] <Muimi> yeah like people with power sleves who are typing fast

[19:29:48] <scarlet_razor> how to remove array where <div id=xx> in jquery ?
[19:29:51] <imsky> power sleeves and buttrons i guess
[19:30:08] * dblosevn running away :-)
[19:30:13] <alexnet> don't fight kids
[19:31:09] <Muimi> yeah
[19:31:14] <Muimi> i'll paste some code later
[19:32:34] <Muimi> The only thing that really bothers me is... why would someone say this isn't a good first place to go?
[19:33:30] <Muimi> people here are often really cool and it's just a chat so
[19:33:40] <abjorn> imsky: lol
[19:34:30] <razzi> scarlet_razor, what do you mean?
[19:35:55] <scarlet_razor> razzi: this explain what i mean... sorry very basic question
[19:36:29] <dblosevn> mumi: what was your problem i was fighting with strighttalk trying to activate a sim card lol
[19:39:42] <imsky> abjorn: what it do playa, you glad to be in texas?
[19:41:04] <nights> what keywords would you guys target for like a virtual ship trading game based around caribbean? :)
[19:41:17] <imsky> voodoo
[19:41:22] <imsky> and beefsteak
[19:41:37] <dblosevn> strippers and erotic massage
[19:41:41] <razzi> and ja mann
[19:41:46] <imsky> ganja
[19:41:48] <imsky> man
[19:45:21] <nights> dblosevn: but those are high competitive
[19:51:11] <dblosevn> nights: so carribean strippers
[19:52:25] <mouses> is there a good php channel on freenode?
[19:52:33] <mouses> #php is invite only
[19:52:48] <Eviltwin> ##php
[19:52:57] <EmmaJ> http://youtu.be/e_SRShE0mGE
[19:53:05] <mouses> i just want to parse some json w/ php
[19:53:14] <Eviltwin> /join ##php
[19:53:15] <Muimi> okay, so here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/Muimi/D4ZaZ/5/
[19:53:30] <mouses> i dont have identity
[19:53:31] <Muimi> if you go to http://jsfiddle.net/Muimi/D4ZaZ/3/, you get "ajax failed"
[19:53:36] <mouses> so i cant get in ##php
[19:53:43] <Eviltwin> #php != ##php
[19:53:48] <Eviltwin> You should be able to get into at least one of those
[19:53:55] <Eviltwin> Note that one has # and one has ##
[19:54:11] <Muimi> yeah actually i think #php redirects to ##php
[19:54:12] <mouses> yeah i tried both
[19:54:14] <Muimi> go to #help instead
[19:54:24] <Muimi> you need an identity, which means you need to register with the nickserv.  They'll tell you how.
[19:54:26] <mouses> #php is invite only... ##php needs me to identify on the network
[19:54:41] <Muimi> yeah so /msg nickserv register help i think
[19:54:42] <Eviltwin> Then identify on the network
[19:54:53] <Eviltwin> Why don't we do that
[19:55:11] <Muimi> no /msg nickserv help register
[19:55:30] <Muimi> because after you register you log in by typing /msg nickserf identify mouses password
[19:55:46] <Muimi> oh right.... maybe it's a good idea, Eviltwin. :)
[19:55:54] <Muimi> It protects the people in the chat, I think.
[19:56:02] <mouses> they need an email, do i have to give a real one?
[19:56:15] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:56:26] <mouses> damn
[19:56:35] <Muimi> they haven't spammed me yet, if that gives you some peace of mind
[19:56:38] <Eviltwin> They don't spam you, it's for password recovery
[19:56:50] <eph3meral> and to prevent *you* from spamming them
[19:56:52] <mouses> damn ok
[19:56:57] <mouses> thx
[19:57:03] <Muimi> so there must be something wrong with the 'success' function, or my php?
[19:57:26] <Muimi> because .done isn't putting anything down
[19:57:44] <nights> caribbean strippers
[19:57:44] <nights> hmm
[19:57:48] <nights> thats pretty good
[19:58:03] <nights> strippers can be traded commodities too i think
[19:58:08] <nights> fungibles :p
[19:59:12] <Muimi> i can't figure out if i should be using msg or data
[20:01:12] <Muimi> mainly that's the issue i'm dealing with now.  anyone know hwo to do this?
[20:01:15] <grafi> dumb question but doesnt the request just fail because form2.php doesnt exist? or have you done something to tell fiddle where to look :o
[20:03:46] <Muimi> it's in the same directory
[20:03:58] <Muimi> see the css portion?  That's actually the PHP I'm using.
[20:07:02] <Muimi> I'm going through what looks to be a really good tutorial on the topic.
[20:16:55] <Muimi> nah, that one isn't working either. :(
[20:17:00] <grafi> im saying that even if your code was correct, it still would fail because there is no such ressource as form2.php on jsfiddle.net. so the fiddle is ok to show what you tried, but saying "see it fails" doesnt show anything
[20:18:25] <grafi> what exactly seems to be the problem? form2.php not returning anything, or do you get the failed message on your webspace/localhost too?
[20:21:50] <Muimi> not getting anything returned
[20:21:55] <Muimi> I don't get the failed message.
[20:22:43] <Muimi> I also went through this tutorial: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107 which people have said works...  It didn't work for me.
[20:23:13] <tw2113> console errors?
[20:23:33] <Muimi> but look at the version they're using
[20:23:58] <grafi> k, did you try data: $('form').serialize(), at some point?
[20:24:01] <Muimi> thanks
[20:24:07] <Muimi> GET http://localhost/javascript/jquery-1.8.2.js 404 (Not Found)
[20:24:35] <Muimi> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[20:25:22] <Muimi> weird.  on line one.  $(document).ready(
[20:31:19] <grafi> [04:23:58] <grafi> k, did you try data: $('form').serialize(), at some point? Muimi ?
[20:32:28] <Muimi> nope
[20:33:06] <Muimi> Current version, grafi: http://jsfiddle.net/Muimi/D4ZaZ/8/
[20:33:12] <Muimi> I checked the brackets really well.
[20:33:45] <Muimi> I feel like seralizing it will just make it more complicated than it already is.
[20:33:54] <Muimi> I mean, it's already arrayized.
[20:33:56] <agi_> hi guys, i want to resize iframe in jquery. It automatically get height:150px.

[21:37:39] <vladikoff> Muimi, sometimes
[21:47:35] <Guest34836> how can I get the text of the currently selected <select>option onchange?  I tried  $(this).text()  but it just alerts out all of the text for the entire select, not the selected option.  Any ideas?
[22:13:32] <vedic> Is it possible to not highlight a specific item in a select drop down when the cursor comes on it? or just skip that item and move the cursor to next item in the drop down
[22:14:07] <tw2113> ?pointer
[22:14:11] <bot-t> tw2113, jQuery.Sortable Tolerance: "pointer" problem - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2837
[22:18:38] <VX> whats the function of a $("$sometextinput") to change the value ?
[22:18:41] <vedic> Looks like I found it here: http://jsfiddle.net/dZqEu/
[22:18:49] <tw2113> ?val @ VX
[22:18:49] <bot-t> VX, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[22:18:59] <tw2113> i believe
[22:19:05] <tw2113> someone correct me if i'm wrong
[22:20:10] <VX> tw2113 yeah i think thats right, i was using it but wasnt getting a result, ill check the syntax again
[23:18:08] <VX> whats the best way to append text to a text area refered to by id
[23:19:32] <\mSg> .append?
[23:19:44] <Stephen> var ta = $("#textareaid"); ta.val(ta.val()+"newText");
[23:21:59] <Stephen> VX: append actually works
[23:22:34] <Stephen> Here was my code to test:
[23:22:40] <Stephen> $(document.body).append($("<textarea id='te'>Hello</textarea>")); var te = $("#te"); te.append(" Goodbye");
[23:22:49] <Stephen> Works great
[23:23:06] <Cork> append works cause textarea has the text as its content
[23:23:20] <Cork> compared to input elements that has it as an attribute value
[23:23:21] <Stephen> yup, the text is considered a child node
[23:25:15] <Cork> Stephen: btw you don't need $() in append
[23:25:27] <Cork> $(document.body).append("<textarea id='te'>Hello</textarea>"); works fine
[23:25:56] <Stephen> true, thanks for the correction
[23:26:04] <Cork> and that actually a point that makes append in a textarea a bit risky
[23:26:40] <Cork> te.append("<span>some <b>random</b> html for your cms</span>");
[23:26:46] <Cork> no clue what would happen there...
[23:29:31] <Stephen> Actually, it seems to filter it
[23:29:43] <Stephen> Wierd
[23:29:55] <Stephen> So, here's the result in Chrome:
[23:30:01] <Cork> question is if its cross browser
[23:30:12] <Stephen> Dom Element displayed retains the text "Hello"
[23:30:24] <Stephen> te.val() also returns "Hello"
[23:30:26] <Stephen> however
[23:30:54] <Stephen> When I did this"
[23:30:56] <Stephen> te.append(" <span>Goodbye <b>Friend</b> Okay?</span>");
[23:31:38] <Stephen> te.text() returns: "HelloGoodbye Friend Okay?"
[23:31:48] <Cork> that makes sense
[23:31:59] <Cork> what do you get from .html() ?
[23:32:01] <Stephen> te.html() = Hello<span>Goodbye <b>Friend</b> Okay?</span>
[23:32:01] <Cork> or .val()
[23:32:26] <Stephen> te.val() = "Hello:"
[23:32:31] <Stephen> er
[23:32:32] <Cork> heh
[23:32:33] <Stephen> te.val() = "Hello"
[23:32:36] <Cork> expected as much
[23:32:43] <Cork> so append is risky
[23:33:11] <Cork> so using ta.val(ta.val() + "string") is better
[23:33:13] <Stephen> If one fears adding <script> tags or something
[23:33:20] <Cork> lol
[23:34:58] <Stephen> yup
[23:35:13] <Stephen> script tags execute inside text areas
