[00:03:47] <Mariaa> dblosevn: you there?
[00:16:31] <dblosevn> Mariaa: ya working
[00:21:56] <Shucky> hi nicolasleloup :-)
[00:22:07] <nicolasleloup> hi all !
[00:25:43] <nicolasleloup> hi all
[00:26:01] <chare> how do i tell if the third child exists or not so that i can do       s = $('#analysis div:nth-child(' + 3 + ')');
[00:26:40] <nicolasleloup> i'm using jquery.easing in a webpage, with other js files, but i have a conflict with them
[00:27:27] <dblosevn> s = $('#analysis div:nth-child(2)');if (undefined !== s) { }
[00:27:55] <nicolasleloup> and when i use the other files, i get an error like this : "p.easing[this.easing] is not a function" in the jquery.easing file ?
[00:29:28] <nicolasleloup> I tried to use "jQuery.noconflict();" but it didn't solve my problem
[00:29:35] <nicolasleloup> does someone have an idea ?
[00:30:24] <chare> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/B3eCy/    its not giving back undefined
[00:34:28] <Xtrivity> Hey guys is there a way to do a ternary operator where it calls to functions for example: (!$.browser.opera) ? $.getScript("test.js"), $.getScript("test2.js") : null;
[00:40:14] <Cork> Xtrivity: you would have to use a self executing function; so technically yes, but practically... no
[00:40:56] <Cork> (!$.browser.opera) ? (function() { $.getScript("test.js"); $.getScript("test2.js"); })() : null;
[00:41:21] <Cork> your better of with a clean if statement there
[00:48:01] <treeprogram> I don't know jquery, but I'm trying to use some jquery I found somewhere to make table cells that are highlighted when a mouse is clicked and dragged over them: http://codepad.org/cyBP0A8W I was wondering if any one could tell me how I can make the values, or the 'id' values, from each highlighted cell added to an array, 'input', that I can then pass to PHP to do some server side processing
[00:48:48] <treeprogram> to clarify, I'd like the cell td values (or 'id' values if that's easier), passed upon the 'submit' button being clicked
[00:50:12] <treeprogram> actually disregard that last part, it doesn't matter when the values are assigned to 'input', as long as 'input' is set by the time the outputvalue() function is run
[00:51:56] <dblosevn> Mariaa: finally lol http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/27/
[00:52:25] <Xtrivity> Hey Cork: found a bunch of inconsistencies with onpopstate - what a nightmare that was to figure out. I have a quick question tho. When i use .animate() doesn't matter the size of the div a scrollbar doesn't appear. It may just be a css trick but I can't figure out how to add a scrollbar for the page if it needs to scroll
[00:53:04] <dblosevn> chare: still here? sorry was workin on something
[00:53:20] <chare> YOU LIED TO ME
[00:53:27] <Cork> Xtrivity: animate should give you a scrollbar as long as the element your animating has one
[00:53:27] <chare> I USE .LENGTH ==0 TEST
[00:53:48] <Cork> O_o
[00:53:53] <kzrdt> hi
[00:54:15] <Xtrivity> Cork: here's my test url: http://www.tybster.com (i'm using firebug to try to make a scrollbar appear on the content (if you go to about page) but nothing.
[00:54:43] <dblosevn> ya that would work too lol
[00:55:13] <kzrdt> I'm  trying to display a slider with http://jqueryui.com/slider/ but I want to display a progression bar when I change the slider value (behind my hook)
[00:55:23] <Cork> Xtrivity: not sure what you mean, everything fitts in the div, why should it show a scrollbar?
[00:55:47] <kzrdt> As you can see, there is none on the Default functionality but it is displayed on other examples
[00:55:54] <Xtrivity> Cork: say you minimized your browser so that the height is 120px... I want a slider to appear on the side
[00:56:00] <kzrdt> But I don't see with what options :S
[00:56:23] <dblosevn> chare: forgot it returns a jquery object, so you test .length
[00:56:36] <chare> SEE
[00:56:41] <chare> YOU ARE NOT SO SMART
[00:56:54] <chare> THATS WHY ALL THE GIRLS DUMP YOU
[00:57:00] <chare> THEY FIND OUT THAT EINSTEIN WAS SMARTER THAN YOU
[00:57:52] <Cork> chare: stop shouting!
[00:57:54] <dblosevn> chare: hmm, nice and i agree einstien was smarter then me, and ... why are you yelling
[00:58:11] <shoky> it's his thing.
[00:58:42] <buu> I HEARD THERE WAS SHOUTING GOING ON IN HERE
[00:58:59] <Cork> Xtrivity: your looking for something like overflow:auto on contentContainer =
[00:59:00] <Cork> *?
[00:59:05] <dblosevn> I guess im an idiot lmao, i should quit my job and go work at mcdonalds lmao
[00:59:14] <chare> MCDONALDS WTF
[00:59:18] <chare> AT LEAST GO FOR BURGERKING
[00:59:25] <Cork> chare: quit it!
[00:59:42] <Cork> chare: DON'T talk in all caps!
[00:59:43] <Xtrivity> Cork: yes - but it doesn't seem to work
[01:00:07] <shoky> Cork: he's already been told, many times
[01:00:33] <Cork> Xtrivity: if you want it to adjust to the height of the browser viewport you'll hit the classic inherit problem
[01:00:41] <dblosevn> Mariaa: you still here?
[01:01:08] <dblosevn> probally took too long lol her code didnt work @ all lol
[01:01:27] <Cork> Xtrivity: html isn't normally made to make things limit the height in these kind of ways, so you will have to do quite a bit of css trickery (or js, if your lacy ;P )
[01:02:09] <Cork> Xtrivity: for an element to be limited to the height of the viewport ALL its parents has to be height: 100%
[01:02:29] <chare> you gonna go for burgerking?
[01:02:31] <Cork> or at least a specific height
[01:02:54] <dblosevn> Cork: cant height be auto on children if parent is 100%?
[01:03:02] <Mariaa> yes dblosevn
[01:03:28] <Cork> dblosevn: audo won't mean anything
[01:03:28] <dblosevn> Mariaa: I got it lol, http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/27/
[01:03:37] <Cork> dblosevn: that just means it will adjust to the height of its content
[01:04:14] <Xtrivity> Cork: can you jsfiddle me an quick example of what you would do via js or such - i am trying to follow just don't know how i'd go about trying to solve my problem with the information you've provided.
[01:04:20] <dblosevn> Cork: ya ive had issues with that in the past, I hate design Ill stick to development

[01:05:12] <JosephFerano> hi
[01:05:15] <Cork> Xtrivity: give those a read
[01:05:19] <Xtrivity> will do.
[01:05:29] <dblosevn> Mariaa: np
[01:05:39] <Cork> kzrdt: so you basically want a progress element "behind" your slider?
[01:05:59] <JosephFerano> I'm a game programmer looking to do some web development, people have been recommending jQuery, I had some questions for you good people, if I may
[01:06:16] <dblosevn> I think Ive done my part for a couple months lol gonna play with my pbx now lol
[01:07:02] <Cork> ?ask @ JosephFerano
[01:07:04] <bot-t> JosephFerano, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:07:23] <Cork> JosephFerano: ^ and thats a good common rule where ever you ask questions on irc
[01:07:33] <Cork> don't make ppl ask for your question
[01:07:37] <JosephFerano> Cork: I know, I spend a lot of time on IRC, but I like being polite
[01:07:43] <JosephFerano> I was actually typing it out :)
[01:07:46] <Cork> your actually not
[01:08:16] <Cork> start with the question and take the rest afterwards
[01:08:29] <Cork> (then ppl know what to look for)
[01:09:06] <JosephFerano> I was looking into C# MVC3 and EF but a friend said that I shouldn't bother and to look into jQuery instead, obviously from what I understand, jQuery doesn't do any backend stuff (something I unfortunately don't get to work with much in game development)
[01:09:58] <Xtrivity> Cork: I'll keep reading if you think I should but even if I statically set the height to 3000px of the contentContainer it does not produce  a scrollbar
[01:09:59] <JosephFerano> so one question is, would I be able to still use EF or would you guys recommend I use another backend? I'm trying to get the gist of what technologies I need to add to the list, so I can keep myself busy for the next few months
[01:10:51] <Cork> Xtrivity: where do you want the scrollbar, i'm starting to feel i might think you want it at a place other then you actually want it >_<
[01:11:33] <Cork> JosephFerano: jquery doesn't care about the server code
[01:11:44] <Cork> JosephFerano: all it cares about is the html it produces
[01:11:47] <JosephFerano> right
[01:11:47] <chare> so if i wanted to create a prostitution website in jquery how would i do it?
[01:12:27] <dblosevn> JosephFerano: for the easiest start go with php for the backend and jQuery for the frontend, optionally being you have knowledge of c# you might go asp.net c# for the backend
[01:12:38] <Xtrivity> Cork: say that the content of any page is super long (say roughly 3000px)... no scroll bar appears for me to be able to scroll down to read any of the text
[01:12:44] <TheBrayn> chare: with blackjack and hookers?
[01:12:49] <kzrdt> Cork: yes :p
[01:12:58] <Cork> Xtrivity: on what element >_<'
[01:13:06] <dblosevn> chare: pay me 10k and ill do it for you
[01:13:14] <Xtrivity> Cork: contentContainer
[01:13:21] <dblosevn> might even throw a hooker or two your way lmao
[01:13:26] <chare> dblosevn: you're that noob at jquery that didn't know to use length
[01:13:29] <kzrdt> But I don't see what options display it
[01:13:31] <JosephFerano> dblosevn: yeah, C# would be kind of the easiest entry point for me, I've been using it for the past 2 years, the EF looks pretty neat, it's actually somewhat similar to what I do with Serialized objects
[01:13:35] <Cork> Xtrivity: ok, then yes you need to set height of all its parents, and overflow: auto on the element
[01:13:47] <JosephFerano> I just didn't like the MVC pattern that .NET is using
[01:13:52] <Cork> kzrdt: you need to generate that your self
[01:13:57] <JosephFerano> not the pattern itself, the way they structure it
[01:13:59] <Cork> kzrdt: its fairly simple though
[01:14:03] <chare> who the hell uses microsoft technology like .net?
[01:14:20] <JosephFerano> chare: I use Mono, which is really close
[01:14:34] <xec_> chare: I do
[01:14:35] <chare> Go > C#
[01:14:51] <anli> Is css(
[01:14:53] <anli> oops
[01:15:07] <anli> Is css('height', null); a cross browser safe way of removing a css attribute?
[01:15:07] <kzrdt> but how do I generate it? I don't see that in the examples
[01:15:13] <dblosevn> chare: I used to before I learned php one of the many languages I know
[01:15:24] <chare> Ruby on Rails > php
[01:15:45] <dblosevn> ror isnt even a language lmao or shouldnt be anyways
[01:16:10] <chare> so you admit that ror > php
[01:16:31] <dblosevn> id choose php over ror anyday ror takes no brains at all
[01:16:34] <Axsuul> Can anyone recommend a plugin for doing sticky headers?
[01:17:06] <Xtrivity> Cork: but i've done that. body { height: 100%} middle{min-height: 100%} contentContainer {height: 100%; overflow:auto} yet no scroll bar appears (and my guess is because its based on the .animate but still statically when browser has loaded the page -- can't make a scrollbar load
[01:17:33] <Cork> kzrdt: http://jsfiddle.net/3rTzZ/
[01:17:52] <dblosevn> Axsuul: maybe http://polarblau.github.com/stickySectionHeaders/
[01:18:08] <chare> dblosevn: lol you voluntarily allocate your brain to php rather than to something more important
[01:18:23] <JosephFerano> so jQuery takes care of ajax style asynchronous calls as well?
[01:18:23] <Cork> Xtrivity: you've updated the url you gave me?
[01:18:30] <dblosevn> php is one of the many languages I know
[01:18:49] <dblosevn> @room how old is this kid lmao
[01:18:50] <Xtrivity> Cork: just local testing -- one moment
[01:19:23] <chare> dblosevn so you're one of those old guys that don't like change?
[01:19:46] <dblosevn> not at all only 30, and i constantly learn new stuff every day
[01:19:58] <Cork> dblosevn: why do you even argue with him?
[01:20:07] <anli> Is an empty string a as value of a css attribute the default?
[01:20:16] <Cork> just let him be until he gets tired of it
[01:20:19] <Rido> Hello, I'm using jQuery 1.8.1 but I've got some problems with animating the backgroundPosition.
[01:20:23] <Rido> It doesn't work.
[01:20:33] <chare> Cork you know i'm right when I pick out Go and Ruby on Rails
[01:20:36] <Rido> I use backgroundPosition:"-100px 10px"
[01:20:41] <dblosevn> Cork: ya, I feel ya
[01:20:45] <Cork> anli: no, not really, its an invalid value so the rule gets removed
[01:20:46] <Xtrivity> Cork: http://tybster.com/about updated.
[01:21:14] <dblosevn> Cork: I fixed it, added to ignore lol
[01:22:13] <Cork> Xtrivity: ugg, i missed that your bg is fixed
[01:22:19] <Cork> that breaks all of that
[01:22:23] <reloadz> hey! is it possible to get values from $(div input....).val() into iframe - for me it doesn't work!
[01:22:26] <reloadz> ?
[01:22:45] <dblosevn> reloadz: only if the iframe is hosted on the same domain
[01:22:52] <reloadz> yes
[01:22:59] <Xtrivity> Cork: yeah. I had a feeling - just not sure what I can do as a work around.
[01:23:28] <dblosevn> reloadz: if on the same domain you can access the dom of the iframe from the parent and vise versa
[01:24:10] <dblosevn> $('iframeselector').get(0).contentDocument is the dom of the iframe
[01:24:33] <reloadz> press "drukât" ans at the bottom vill creat an iframe where is the same calcolator, just missing values http://euroaudit.lv/lv/algu-kalkulators
[01:24:43] <reloadz> i cant paste them in the fields...
[01:24:43] <kzrdt> Cork thanks, it's normal that it's doesn't work right? I have to make a function to follow my slider is it right?
[01:24:45] <Cork> dblosevn: or just $(iframe).contents()
[01:24:50] <reloadz> thoe sytex looks fine
[01:25:12] <reloadz> "drukât" = print... right side there is print idon
[01:25:13] <Rido> Does nobody know the solution to animate the background-position?
[01:25:17] <dblosevn> Cork: nice, never used jquery to do it before just pure js
[01:25:19] <Cork> kzrdt: you need to listen for the slide event yes
[01:25:51] <Cork> Rido: plugin or using the step callback
[01:26:02] <kzrdt> Cork: ok thanks, I thought it was just coming with the slider function as it's not referenced in the examples
[01:26:59] <Cork> kzrdt: where do you see the progressbar in the demos?
[01:27:04] <Cork> the rage selectors?
[01:27:18] <faraway> Rido: smooth or in intervals ?
[01:27:44] <Rido> I prefer smooth because it's a menu animation
[01:28:26] <Cork> kzrdt: if you mean http://jqueryui.com/slider/#rangemin
[01:28:40] <Cork> thats not really a progressbar, just a range with one handle
[01:28:43] <vict0ria> how do i redirect to other page if some-new-custom css class was detected on current page
[01:29:06] <shoky> Rido have you tried solutions like: http://nelsonwells.net/2012/08/using-bgpos-js-with-jquery-18/
[01:29:20] <reloadz> dblosevn: TypeError: $("iframeselector") is null
[01:29:31] <Cork> vict0ria: $(function() { if($('.some-class').length > 0) { window.location = 'new location'; } });
[01:29:54] <vict0ria> is that new location Cork is the path after domain?
[01:29:55] <dblosevn> reloadz: um.... iframeselector should br replaced with the selector for your iframe
[01:30:12] <Cork> vict0ria: yes ;)
[01:30:12] <Rido> shoky, I didn't try that solution yet. I'm going to try it now. Thank you
[01:30:20] <reloadz> still not working
[01:30:40] <eshlox> hm, how can i speed it up? http://wklej.org/id/847566/
[01:30:55] <Axsuul> dblosevn: thank you, i went with this https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints
[01:31:02] <Cork> vict0ria: you can enter a relative path, or a full fqdn + path
[01:31:07] <Xtrivity> Cork: should I hit the css chan up you think to get my answer?
[01:31:12] <faraway> Rido: don't knwo if it is cross browser, but you just can animate the background-position-x background-position-y
[01:31:18] <kzrdt> Cork: yes that's what I want, the gray bar following the handle
[01:31:19] <Cork> Xtrivity: should be good yes
[01:31:21] <dblosevn> reloadz: use $('iframeselector').contents().find('selectoriniframe').val();
[01:31:33] <kzrdt> it's not on default functionnality
[01:31:49] <Cork> Xtrivity: but height is css is a tricky business, and fixed doesn't exactly help
[01:32:01] <Cork> kzrdt: it is
[01:32:40] <Cork> kzrdt: view-source:http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/rangemin.html
[01:32:50] <dblosevn> Axsuul: np
[01:33:04] <Rido> faraway, I've tried that method but it doesn't work in Firefox :S Normally everything works in Firefox :P
[01:33:34] <shoky> yea background-position-x /y are not in w3c standard
[01:33:35] <Xtrivity> Cork: yeah - when the bg div is not fixed the scrollbar appears fine. I was thinking of putting another container inside but no real luck
[01:34:19] <shoky> Rido but that snippet seems to work fine
[01:34:19] <faraway> Rido: ;)  ok .. for some reason i thought i could not be that simple :D
[01:34:28] <Rido> shoky that plugin works!!
[01:34:32] <shoky> ;]
[01:34:38] <Cork> Xtrivity: try this; the content in a container with position: relative; z-index: 2; and the bg with fixed and z-index: 1; separate, from the rest
[01:34:39] <Rido> Thnx!
[01:35:11] <Cork> Xtrivity: that way you don't move the content out of the textflow and scrolls should work as intended
[01:37:49] <kzrdt> Cork: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/default.html No, it isn't. It is indeed with your example and what I need to know is what options I need to add to obtain this behaviour
[01:40:13] <reloadz> dblosevn: i don't need to get values out of iframe, but get them in!
[01:40:30] <reloadz> + all my selector attemts failed
[01:40:58] <reloadz> attempts*
[01:41:02] <Mariaa> dblosevn: you still there?
[01:41:21] <dblosevn> reloadz: does your iframe have an id or is it the only  iframe on the page?
[01:41:26] <dblosevn> Mariaa: yep
[01:42:15] <reloadz> i can add class
[01:42:48] <dblosevn> well an id would be more appropriate considering you dont want to access the dom of multiple iframes
[01:43:13] <Cork> reloadz: where is the iframe on your page; i can't find it
[01:43:26] <dblosevn> Cork: I couldnt either
[01:43:42] <Cork> so... if the iframe isn't there; thats why you can't find it
[01:43:47] <dblosevn> Cork: nor could I find the button he was referring too
[01:43:58] <Cork> what button?
[01:44:08] <reloadz> pres - "Drukât" right corner (print icon)
[01:44:16] <Mariaa> dblosevn:  the field still shows my pc's clock value and not server value http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/27/
[01:44:17] <reloadz> and iframe v\will spawn at the bottom
[01:44:32] <Cork> might NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://euroaudit.lv/algu-kalkulators/ <-- be the cause?
[01:45:16] <dblosevn> Cork: <reloadz> press "drukât" ans at the bottom vill creat an iframe where is the same calcolator, just missing values http://euroaudit.lv/lv/algu-kalkulators
[01:45:28] <dblosevn> I couldnt find that button
[01:45:41] <Cork> ya, but if you check your console
[01:45:55] <Cork> you'll see that after it loaded the page you get a 403 from the same url
[01:46:16] <dblosevn> Mariaa: I set a static date, you cant use php date on jsfiddler
[01:46:35] <dblosevn> Mariaa: send me the link back I sent you
[01:46:50] <reloadz> dblosevn: yes! i need to get thoes values in that iframe.... so it prints them out also
[01:47:08] <matiit> https://github.com/matiit/portfolio/blob/master/application/views/admin/add.blade.php#L16 hey <- I did it little ugly. Do you have an idea how to make it clean? Thanks!
[01:47:09] <Mariaa> http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/27/
[01:48:01] <Mariaa> dblosevn: i mean if my clock is set to a date the fields here show that date, so may be we need php in  $j('#d').val(selectedDate.getDate()); this line
[01:48:20] <shoky> reloadz: jQuery('iframe').contents().find('input[name=sumFrom]')
[01:48:22] <dblosevn> Mariaa: replace the static dates with <?=date('m/d/Y')?>
[01:48:26] <shoky> reloadz: works fine
[01:48:45] <vict0ria> i dont know Cork nothings happening. i refresh the page, the custom class appears, your script loads and no redirect.
[01:48:47] <dblosevn> Mariaa: leave the min date alone
[01:49:31] <Mariaa> dblosevn: you mean i must change the dafaultDate?
[01:49:46] <dblosevn> and maxDate
[01:49:58] <dblosevn> Mariaa: also                 var today = new Date(<?=date('m/d/Y')?>);
[01:50:15] <dblosevn> Mariaa: at the bottom
[01:50:23] <reloadz> shoky: man! i don't need to get values, but put them in!
[01:50:31] <shoky> reloadz: jQuery('iframe').contents().find('input[name=sumFrom]').val('WOW')
[01:50:34] <shoky> works fine too.
[01:50:35] <Mariaa> right, i think this var is where the problem lies
[01:50:44] <dblosevn> oh
[01:50:49] <dblosevn>                 var today = new Date('<?=date('m/d/Y')?>');
[01:51:14] <reloadz> thx!
[01:51:36] <dblosevn> Mariaa: http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/28/
[01:51:44] <shoky> o_O  Cork and dblosevn told you that 30 min ago
[01:52:03] <dblosevn> shoky: I gave up lol
[01:52:06] <shoky> heh
[01:52:16] <Mariaa> it says $j("#hidden-date").datepicker is not a function, although jquery and jquery ui are loaded in my page and datepicker also worked...strange
[01:52:41] <dblosevn> Mariaa: you have to include the hidden field i added
[01:52:49] <Mariaa> i did that dblosevn
[01:56:34] <maloik> Anyone see what's up with this? http://jsfiddle.net/BebPf/
[01:57:04] <maloik> wait wtf, that works on jsfiddle
[01:57:13] <maloik> straight copypaste from my browser
[01:57:53] <dblosevn> maloik: ugly but ya it works lol
[01:58:13] <maloik> yea I know it's ugly :) just a test for now
[01:58:20] <maloik> but it doesnt seem to work when I put it in my project
[01:58:31] <maloik> object has no method on
[01:59:16] <dblosevn> why not just $('#mailbox_password.strength_checked span a').click(function () { });
[01:59:18] <shoky> maloik: what jquery ver you using
[01:59:35] <shoky> .on is 1.6+
[01:59:47] <dblosevn> instead of all that nonsense
[01:59:56] <maloik> shoky: hmm... before that ?
[02:00:03] <shoky> hmm?
[02:00:11] <maloik> what sohuld it be in older versions ?
[02:00:23] <dblosevn> the method I just showed you will work
[02:00:24] <maloik> or is there nothing like it
[02:00:27] <shoky> .bind or the shortcut dblosevn suggests
[02:00:38] <maloik> dblosevn: sorry missed it :) will try, thanks
[02:01:07] <dblosevn> no need for all that next children and all that stuffs :-D
[02:01:31] <shoky> actually
[02:01:46] <shoky> the span and the a  are not descendants of the input..
[02:02:01] <shoky> as inputs don't have descendants
[02:02:16] <maloik> indeed just noticed that
[02:02:21] <maloik> hence why I was using next etc
[02:02:26] <dblosevn> $('#mailbox_password.strength_checked:next span a')
[02:02:54] <kzrdt> Cork: So, is it the range options?
[02:02:58] <shoky> $('#mailbox_password-link').click  ..
[02:03:17] <shoky> if you have ids, use them for selections ;p
[02:03:18] <dblosevn> wow i didnt even lookk to see if that had an id lol
[02:04:26] <shoky> don't think there's any  :next
[02:04:49] <fRAiLtY-> Am I right in thinking the logging for this chan is -8hrs (GMT)
[02:05:05] <maloik> I assumed the id would be the same for all of those buttons that get generated across several pages, but I just need this function on one of them
[02:05:12] <maloik> may be wrong about that though so trying with the id indeed
[02:05:47] <shoky> maloik: id's should be unique
[02:06:05] <Siver> Hmm, I'm stuck creating a sticky toggle button for a content div ... the toggling itself isn't the issue, but how can I attach my toggle "trigger" to my container to slide with it, but keep visible when the container itself disappears?
[02:07:05] <shoky> Siver: obviously the button shouldn't be a descendant of whatever element it is that you're hiding
[02:07:16] <Siver> Because right now I manage to have a static toggle button that stays in place, regardless of the current state of the content block that is toggled ... OR it is attached to the container and therefore will also be set to display: none when it's being toggled
[02:07:23] <shoky> well, donno what you mean by 'slide with it'
[02:07:26] <shoky> a fiddle would help
[02:07:31] <Siver> shoky: yeah, I figured, but how do I stick it to the container to animate with it then?
[02:07:33] <maloik> shoky: I know. note the 'across pages' ;)
[02:07:41] <Nancy2012> i want to show an loading image till my upload wouldn't be completed
[02:07:48] <maloik> also: the thing I was trying to do is something I apparently implemented last week. wow.
[02:07:49] <shoky> maloik: ah k
[02:07:57] <maloik> thats how you notice a lack of sleep I suppose
[02:08:00] <Nancy2012> Is there any way in jquery ??
[02:09:13] <shoky> Siver: you could have a common ancestor for the button and the container, and animate that ancestor for sliding or whatever. but hide only the inner container.. i guess?
[02:09:41] <Cork> kzrdt: yes
[02:10:01] <Siver> shoky: I also tried that just a minute ago, but I'm currently still missing something ... I'm jsfiddling it atm
[02:10:07] <Cork> kzrdt: your doing a range selection but with one of the values fixed
[02:16:25] <dblosevn> shoky: your right its not :next its #id + span a
[02:16:52] <dblosevn> shoky: I knew you could do it i just forgot the proper selector
[02:16:58] <Xtrivity> Cork: solved the problem. Had to create a large fixed element in the back with a z-index greater than the fixed background but less than the footer and header and add overflow:auto
[02:17:35] <Siver> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/j82zK/
[02:18:01] <Siver> The green block should stick to the red block, while staying visible
[02:22:49] <soc42> hi #jquery
[02:23:28] <soc42> which lint do you recommend for automated js/jquery error testing?
[02:24:12] <seutje> jshint
[02:25:03] <Siver> Anyone who could help me out with this one => http://jsfiddle.net/j82zK/? I need the green block to stick to the red block ... but the green block needs to stay visible when sliding is completed.
[02:28:04] <soc42> seutje: why do you like it more than other tools like e.g. jslint?
[02:28:11] <soc42> can it be used from cli?
[02:28:16] <seutje> sure
[02:28:21] <seutje> lint makes me cry too often
[02:28:49] <soc42> seutje: oh please, dont' cry ;o)
[02:28:54] <seutje> soc42: u can just npm install jshint iirc
[02:32:26] <shoky> Siver here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/j82zK/1/
[02:33:02] <Siver> shoky: I was just running some tests with animate myself
[02:33:22] <Siver> only issue I'm having right now is that toggling "left" is not as easy
[02:33:30] <Siver> I need to be able to toggle it on and off
[02:35:19] <harshada> hey i need a regular expression to check string containing "-c{Numberic value}", any ide?
[02:35:38] <shoky> Siver: what do you mean toggling "left" ?
[02:35:45] <Cork> harshada: you mean that its only numeric?
[02:36:23] <Siver> shoky: well, that I need it to be able to hide/show when clicking on the green box :-) ... when you click on it now, it just slides to the left, but you cant make it pop out again after that
[02:36:55] <shoky> Siver: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/j82zK/3/
[02:36:56] <Cork> harshada: or do you mean -c6423864 ?
[02:37:16] <harshada> Cork: yes exactly
[02:37:28] <Cork> harshada: /-c[0-9]+/.test(string)
[02:38:27] <harshada> Cork:  thanks
[02:42:13] <harshada> Cork: One more condition - this match should from end of string. i.e abc-c78-cyu should return false
[02:42:30] <Cork> harshada: /-c[0-9]+^/.test(string)
[02:42:33] <Cork> opps
[02:42:34] <Cork> sorry
[02:42:37] <Cork> harshada: /-c[0-9]+$/.test(string)
[02:43:10] <harshada> Cork: great, thank you so much
[02:43:17] <Cork> np
[02:45:11] <Siver> shoky: yep, that did it, thx :-)
[02:46:32] <dblosevn> shoky: much prettier then I did it I got to be tired lmao
[02:47:08] <dblosevn> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Ryg73/1/ lol way overthought
[02:49:05] <shoky> ;P
[02:50:05] <dblosevn> shoky: prolly not 6am for you though lmao
[02:51:16] <VectorX> .
[02:52:47] <VectorX> i got this line to get the required TD's $("table#personal tbody tr:visible td:first-child"); inside the td there is a <a>, i want to get the text of the <a> and add another <a> tag with a link and using that text, how do you do that ?
[02:53:05] <TheBrayn> might there be a problem with .serialize() when one of the input fields has an empty value and this value should be recognised as such?
[02:53:30] <shoky> dblosevn: nope, but lately i'm wide awake at 6am ;P
[02:53:39] <Cork> TheBrayn: form elements thats empty is intentionally excluded
[02:53:58] <Cork> TheBrayn: user a hidden element with a placeholder value as a fallback
[02:54:19] <TheBrayn> I can still see it in the post
[02:54:34] <TheBrayn> with firebug
[02:56:01] <Cork> TheBrayn: hmm, correction unchecked values or disabled values are excluded
[02:56:04] <Cork> not empty values
[02:56:08] <seutje> Siver, shoky: you could use a single handler: http://jsfiddle.net/Ryg73/2/
[02:56:49] <TheBrayn> how can I check if a value is empty and replace it with something?
[02:57:04] <Cork> TheBrayn: use serializeArray
[02:57:53] <Cork> TheBrayn: var arr = $(this).serializeArray(); $.each(arr, function() {}); $.post($.param(arr));
[02:58:29] <Cork> hmm actually $.param isn't needed
[02:58:33] <TheBrayn> $(this) would be the form?
[02:58:44] <Cork> what ever source your using for serialize()
[02:58:59] <SP33D> Hello can any one help me to find a solution for the following problem i googled a lot but couldn't find anything maybe searched the wrong words dunno.
[02:59:31] <SP33D> I need to cut a text at a mark (tag) and then make it apear in a new div
[03:00:34] <SP33D> is ther a plugin for that ?
[03:01:57] <TheBrayn> Cork: how can I get the array in the right form for ajax?
[03:02:30] <TheBrayn> or will it work as well as with .serialize()?
[03:02:49] <Siver> seutje: does left: closed ? mean it will check for the closed class?
[03:03:02] <Siver> or what exactly does "closed" mean in that context
[03:03:50] <Siver> ah nvm it's the boolean you define above, missed that
[03:04:18] <seutje> Siver: yeah, just a boolean I use in a tenary to determine the offset it needs to animate to
[03:04:25] <Siver> Good stuff, wouldn't have thought of that
[03:04:50] <seutje> Siver: only thing I might change is put the toggleclass in a callback to the animate
[03:04:58] <seutje> so the class only changes at the end of the animation
[03:05:04] <Siver> yeah, makes it look just that bit more smooth
[03:05:20] <seutje> and maybe call .stop(true) before animating to make sure it isn't in the middle of an animation
[03:05:28] <SP33D> thx a lot found a good way
[03:05:48] <seutje> cause this implementation might break, sorta, kinda, when u spam-click it
[03:07:51] <Siver> seutje: yeah, I always try to force stop stuff to avoid spamming
[03:07:53] <MalMen> hello http://jsfiddle.net/pB46B/ on $.post the response from the url is allways null, i tryed alert(data); and dont even show me the alert... can anyone give me some advise please ?
[03:12:41] <NodeX> Cross origin request
[03:12:51] <NodeX> port has to be the same - MalMen
[03:13:31] <MalMen> NodeX i cant use http://localhost:3571 ?
[03:14:43] <NodeX> not unless the page calling it originates on port 3571
[03:15:15] <MalMen> damn :\ anyway to solve this with out change ports ?
[03:15:30] <NodeX> proxy via a script on the server is the norm
[03:16:43] <MalMen> and if i load the javascript on a local file and try to access to a remote server ?
[03:16:46] <MalMen> port  80 ?
[03:17:03] <NodeX> the port is not the problem
[03:17:18] <MalMen> so, what is ?
[03:17:23] <NodeX> it's an illegal request because it's treated as a different domain
[03:17:35] <MalMen> damn :S
[03:17:41] <NodeX> ports have to be the same or addresses have to be the same
[03:17:55] <dblosevn> * and
[03:18:17] <NodeX> ^
[03:18:19] <MalMen> and if i am tryng to make a local app only with jquery to load data from another server ?
[03:18:35] <NodeX> not gonna happen
[03:18:37] <dblosevn> could use jsonp or  proxy
[03:18:50] <NodeX> ^^ unless jsonp
[03:19:34] <MalMen> i want to make a phone application with phonegap to load data from server
[03:19:42] <dblosevn> ooo
[03:19:49] <MalMen> i first thing about ajax + html
[03:19:53] <dblosevn> phone gap doesnt care about xdoamin browser security
[03:20:15] <dblosevn> *xdomain
[03:20:29] <dblosevn> just gonna be hard to test outside of the emulator
[03:20:46] <dblosevn> but you can request content from any domain with phonegap
[03:21:11] <MalMen> hmmmmmm
[03:21:22] <dblosevn> its not going to work in a webbrowser though
[03:21:31] <dblosevn> will only work in a uiwebview
[03:21:35] <MalMen> so, what i am doing is right, i am only failing to test it localy... i will test on emulator
[03:22:14] <dblosevn> well technically wrong from normal usuage but not for phonegap it isnt bound by the same rules
[03:22:48] <dblosevn> testing in the emulator in a browser isnt going to work either has to be tested within the app
[03:23:06] <NodeX> not true for phonegap
[03:23:18] <NodeX> I made it do ajax requests using jquery to my server from the emulator
[03:23:31] <NodeX> posting and getting were both fine
[03:23:43] <dblosevn> ya in the phonegap app
[03:23:59] <dblosevn> but in the phones browser xdoamin browser security applys
[03:24:12] <MalMen> damnt, now i cant debug on emulator
[03:24:29] <NodeX> welcome to the world of mobile development lol
[03:24:30] <MalMen> its possible to set anybrowser to be able to make requests to another domain ?
[03:24:34] <dblosevn> id write it using a proxy script locally
[03:24:55] <dblosevn> then when your ready to move it to the app quit using the proxy
[03:26:13] <dblosevn> NodeX: ya phonegap is awesome, im building my first native app now though java is kicking my ass lol
[03:26:38] <dblosevn> been too long since i programmed in a strongly type language
[03:26:52] <dblosevn> php has spoiled me
[03:27:03] <NodeX> I devved an app in phonegap, took 3 weeks, I did the same thing as a html5 website in 3 days
[03:27:20] <NodeX> it's nice but most of the crap you can do in html5
[03:27:31] <dblosevn> bout the same though
[03:27:32] <NodeX> (unless you need the interface API's)
[03:27:50] <dblosevn> the only thing nice about phonegap is being able to access the phone
[03:27:54] <dblosevn> ^^
[03:28:36] <NodeX> yer
[03:28:40] <dblosevn> I try to dev my phonegap apps to work as mobile websites as well
[03:28:47] <NodeX> pretty buggy still I found
[03:29:01] <NodeX> nice piece of kit though
[03:29:15] <NodeX> just need an iPhone emulator for us sane people who DONT own a mac
[03:29:25] <dblosevn> a lot of my clients want the app market presense without having to pay for native development
[03:29:30] <dblosevn> lol
[03:29:33] <NodeX> it's a nice filler
[03:29:39] <dblosevn> I have mac os lion on my win 8 machine
[03:29:50] <dblosevn> hosted in a vm
[03:30:16] <NodeX> kewl
[03:30:25] <dblosevn> cant tell though, my machine is super powerful, feels like its a real machine
[03:30:32] <NodeX> I dislike mac's for the reason that they're not interoperable
[03:30:46] <dblosevn> you can install mac os on a pc
[03:30:48] <NodeX> Apple go out of their way to be difficult
[03:30:52] <dblosevn> just takes some work
[03:31:05] <NodeX> yet they use open source Tech to power the core of OSx
[03:31:09] <dblosevn> was way easier to download a preconfigured vmware image lol
[03:31:55] <dblosevn> this month is learn android month, next month ill move on to ios
[03:32:20] <NodeX> android is a nice OS
[03:32:29] <NodeX> it's very wide spread too, set top boxes etc etc
[03:32:33] <dblosevn> i picked it up pretty suick
[03:32:43] <dblosevn> built 90% of a crm for a local company in like 3 days
[03:32:48] <dblosevn> *quick
[03:33:00] <NodeX> cool
[03:33:13] <dblosevn> yep theres over 3 times as many android phones alone as there are ios
[03:33:31] <dblosevn> not counting non phone devices
[03:33:53] <Giggaflop> hey, i need some whelp with jquery's append not working and not erroring in firebug
[03:34:00] <NodeX> iX's are for hipsters lol
[03:34:10] <Giggaflop> http://pastebin.com/hcp3ZGam
[03:34:13] <NodeX> Giggaflop : pastebin your  ode
[03:34:15] <NodeX> nvm
[03:34:18] <Giggaflop> :P
[03:34:35] <Giggaflop> ignore the {{'s
[03:34:38] <Giggaflop> thats part of django
[03:35:47] <NodeX> Q: How much does a hipster weigh?
[03:35:56] <NodeX> A: 1 intsagram
[03:36:55] <Giggaflop> anyone see why append just seems to do nothing?
[03:37:07] <Giggaflop> line 19
[03:39:03] <jrajav> Heya
[03:39:05] <dblosevn> Giggaflop: is that include required
[03:39:22] <jrajav> Is there a right way to get the width of an image in its .load() handler?
[03:39:39] <dblosevn> Giggaflop: you dont have a protocal in there, shoulod be http or https
[03:40:25] <Giggaflop> dblosevn: that's a protocol agnostic link
[03:40:29] <jrajav> When I retrieve it with $(theImage).width() in the handler, it always returns 0. I've confirmed that accessing it directly at the same point with theHtmlImage.width returns the correct number
[03:41:06] <dblosevn> Giggaflop: http://jsfiddle.net/m8EUs/1/ works fine for me
[03:41:28] <dblosevn> I stripped most of the code as I dont have the service etc required to pull the data
[03:41:46] <Giggaflop> yeah fair enough
[03:41:49] <Giggaflop> ho weird
[03:41:52] <Giggaflop> how*
[03:41:54] <soc42> does anyone use qunit in production?
[03:42:08] <soc42> http://qunitjs.com/
[03:42:21] <jrajav> soc42: Yup, my team does
[03:42:53] <gnarf> soc42: yes
[03:42:57] <jrajav> So apparently this is a bug in jQuery? Is the impression I get from reading some of the comments on http://api.jquery.com/width/
[03:42:58] <gnarf> soc42: jQuery does
[03:42:59] <gnarf> :)
[03:43:15] <soc42> thanksalot
[03:43:29] <gnarf> I use it on every project I work on thi
[03:43:40] <gnarf> jrajav: bug?
[03:43:53] <gnarf> jrajav: you have to wait for the image to be loaded
[03:43:59] <gnarf> jrajav: see ?imagesLoaded
[03:44:00] <bot-t> jrajav, imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[03:44:11] <jrajav> Can I not depend on that in the image's .load handler...?
[03:44:38] <gnarf> jrajav: assuming its in a document and it isn't hidden, yes
[03:44:54] <jrajav> It is hidden, but why should that matter?
[03:45:14] <gnarf> jrajav: hidden elements have no width
[03:45:16] <shoky> ?width
[03:45:17] <bot-t> .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[03:45:23] <shoky> current computed width
[03:45:34] <gnarf> unless they have a width
[03:45:36] <gnarf> but yeah
[03:45:43] <gnarf> computed means it needs to be shown first
[03:45:45] <jrajav> gnarf: And yet if I do the exact same thing, but reading the raw HTML element's .width property, it returns the correct value? :/
[03:46:17] <jrajav> I guess I'm confused about what computed width means
[03:46:21] <dblosevn> show it in a 1px x 1px transparent iframe lol
[03:46:39] <jrajav> I thought it would have accounted for an image with a known width that simply hadn't been shown yet
[03:47:41] <dblosevn> theres no reason for the browser to waste cpu to compute the width of a hidden element that may or maynot be shown to the user
[03:48:15] <gnarf> jrajav: dunno what you are having issue with
[03:48:17] <mikemike> I have a hidden div being shown on a click of another element. I need that div to be hidden again when I click away from it (think of a drop-down nav), is there some sort of listener for the 'not this div' event?
[03:48:20] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:48:27] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Zv8JR/
[03:48:34] <gnarf> seems accurate to me
[03:48:37] <NodeX> jrajav : to compute hidden elements you have to show them quickly then compute then hide
[03:48:59] <gnarf> aha
[03:49:31] <gnarf> jrajav: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/Zv8JR/1/
[03:49:32] <gnarf> anyway
[03:49:35] <dblosevn> it could be shown in a container thats under another though
[03:49:39] <gnarf> width is unreliable on hidden elements
[03:49:50] <gnarf> i think we actually force a 0 because of it
[03:49:59] <gnarf> anything hidden techincally takes no width
[03:50:23] <dblosevn> so you dont get the flicker of showing and hiding it
[03:50:27] <gnarf> jrajav: but i'll double check with mikesherov / others
[03:50:45] <gnarf> dblosevn: you can also show it with left: -9999px :)
[03:51:06] <dblosevn> and flash the horizonal scrollbars lol
[03:51:42] <jrajav> Well, I think I'll just fall back on the raw .width property
[03:51:44] <jrajav> In this case
[03:51:54] <jrajav> Thanks
[03:52:27] <sigurding> is there any reason, why event.pageX delivers wrong values?
[03:52:44] <gnarf> jrajav: yeah, sorry- I'll double check
[03:53:27] <gnarf> dblosevn: what browser shows horiz scroll for negative left?
[03:53:37] <dblosevn> im tired leave me alone lol
[03:53:46] <dblosevn> i was hoping nobody caught that
[03:53:55] <dblosevn> :-D
[03:54:04] <sigurding> I have a complicated problem with the positioning of ui-menu with the help of event.pageX. Setting the position dynamically the menu moves to the bottom the longer I scroll, any idea why?
[03:54:05] <gnarf> dblosevn: I was gonna say, I've used that technique a few times, and we use it in the qunit.css for the fixture
[03:54:52] <gnarf> sigurding: see ?demo
[03:54:52] <bot-t> sigurding, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:55:08] <gnarf> but - i won't be helping you cuz I'm getting on a plane
[03:55:09] <gnarf> ?glwt
[03:55:09] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[03:55:25] <rgr> more css I know, but someone here might know : I'm using a image strip to reduce image loading time  : all icons use a section of the image strip so, e.g the bg imiage for an icon might be background-image : url(toolbarstrip.png) -1232 0 32 32  - locate a 32 x 32 bitmap at 1232 pixels into the strip. Now my Q is can I then rescale using jquery? e.g make it 8 or 16 px in size?
[03:56:14] <dblosevn> only with css3
[03:56:19] <gnarf> rgr: browser compat?
[03:56:34] <gnarf> rgr: you could transform it to reduce its scale in CSS3 support
[03:56:53] <sonja> hi :D
[04:02:25] <Giggaflop> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/m8EUs/3/ still can't get it to work :(
[04:04:27] <dblosevn> Giggaflop: its not going to work with the ajax call on jsfiddler without 1 an absolute url and 2  jsonp\
[04:13:51] <poppiez> any way to open a <select> using jquery?
[04:14:27] <dblosevn> poppiez: open a select, you mean drop it down? if so no
[04:14:42] <poppiez> dblosevn: yes, that's what I mean. damn
[04:15:17] <dblosevn> could use a dropdown plugin and trigger the click event to "open" it
[04:16:15] <YellowAfterlife> Hello. Would anyone happen to know, if there's a good way to set a HTML5 Canvas as element background? The only two options I've found so far are using CSS background-image: url([ base64 of canvas]), which basically copies that for each element, and background-image: -webkit-canvas(...), which, as can be guessed, is Webkit-specific.
[04:17:18] <dblosevn> is there not compatible attribs for moz etc?
[04:18:26] <YellowAfterlife> As far as I've tested, either not, or they are named differently - paired function document.getCSSCanvasContext only exists in Webkit also.
[04:20:23] <dblosevn> ::-moz-canvas
[04:20:33] <Cork> YellowAfterlife: theres -moz-element
[04:20:48] <Cork> can will render the look of the selected element
[04:20:56] <Cork> ?g mdn moz-element

[04:27:28] <regebro> Sorry if this is FAQ, but Google hasn't found anything:
[04:27:41] <rgr> cna smoeone recommend a jquery input plugin which allows freetype and/or file/ajax collected options/  pick?
[04:28:01] <regebro> I'm doing Ajax POSTS, which works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but the post body seems to be empty with IE8.
[04:28:07] <regebro> Anyone has any ideas on that?
[04:30:45] <Mariaa> h
[04:30:45] <Cork> regebro: thats the first i've heard of that
[04:31:05] <Cork> regebro: your sure your actually getting any data to ajax in ie?
[04:31:18] <Mariaa> if i have three same ids on a page, can i use .each() to have a datepicker on each of them, without changing their ids?
[04:31:36] <YelowAfterlife_> dblosevn, Cork: that works in Mozilla. Are there similar properties for Internet Explorer and Opera?
[04:31:42] <Cork> Mariaa: if you have multiple id's on the page, its invalid
[04:31:49] <Cork> Mariaa: you can't use it as id's
[04:31:57] <regebro> Cork: Yup, the data is not empty. I've even tried stepping though the ajax call code, but I couldn't see anything strange...
[04:32:04] <Mariaa> ok Cork
[04:32:05] <regebro> But I'm not familiar with the code, so...
[04:32:07] <Cork> Mariaa:  you can do a really slow attribute selector, thats your only option
[04:32:21] <Cork> Mariaa: or you can fix your invalid id's :)
[04:32:39] <Mariaa> slow attirbute selector? please elaborate
[04:32:52] <Cork> $('[id="value"]')
[04:33:07] <Cork> that will select every element on the page, and check if its attribute id is your value
[04:33:23] <Cork> instead of using the id reference hash
[04:33:26] <dblosevn> that wont work in her case
[04:33:27] <Mariaa> u mean run a for lop kinda thing?
[04:33:45] <Cork> $('[id="value"]').each(function() { $(this) }) yes
[04:33:53] <rgr> gnarf: that wont work since background-size sizes the entire tool strip image.
[04:34:00] <Cork> Mariaa: but you really REALLY should fix your id instead
[04:34:08] <dblosevn> well, it would with some modification to the code inside
[04:34:40] <dblosevn> Mariaa: you didnt mention youd be using that for more then one datepicker lol,
[04:35:14] <Mariaa> dblosevn: i know, i thought its the easier part lol
[04:35:24] <Giggaflop> how does jquery deal with async appends?
[04:35:38] <Cork> Mariaa: if you need to use multiple element you should use a class instead
[04:36:03] <Mariaa> Cork:  yes i will do that i guess
[04:36:07] <Cork> and honestly ppl should use classes more then they do
[04:36:18] <Cork> id's is way WAY overused
[04:36:32] <dblosevn> no had I known you needed multiple datepickers i would have fixed it so you could that could wont work with classes
[04:37:05] <Cork> dblosevn: try to work relative to the target instead
[04:37:14] <Cork> that normally removes that problem all together
[04:37:24] <dblosevn> ya, she already had ids assigned to everything
[04:37:27] <gob> Giggaflop: what do you mean?
[04:37:32] <Cork> ah
[04:38:10] <dblosevn> my minds too gone to fix it now, lot of elements to target
[04:38:48] <dblosevn> and needs a outer wrapper around it to use as a base to find the relative targets
[04:38:53] <Giggaflop> gob, i have multiple scripts running simultaneously adding elements via jquery
[04:39:03] <Giggaflop> gob, and i wondered if that would cause issues
[04:39:52] <Cork> heh concurrency is the fun thing in life :)
[04:40:12] <gob> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2370-Overcoming-Asynchronous-Anxiety-By-Testing-JavaScript-s-Event-Loop.htm
[04:40:20] <gob> look into the event loop
[04:40:22] <sunbeam> whats a recommendable way to have a image hover nav item
[04:40:24] <sunbeam> i know li span a
[04:40:26] <sunbeam> but that is not ok in this case because the nav link has transparent parts
[04:41:03] <Giggaflop> thanks gob
[04:41:06] <gob> Giggaflop: I don't think you'll have any issues
[04:41:12] <Cork> sunbeam: not sure what you mean
[04:41:30] <Cork> you mean a background hover image for a layout menu?
[04:41:48] <Cork> uh.. layout??? *flyout
[04:42:56] <sunbeam> Cork: say i have 5 navigation items, they are not text, but images (background)
[04:42:57] <Mariaa> isn't there somthing like for(i=0;1=1;1++) {$('#mydiv[i]).dosomething() }?
[04:43:07] <Mariaa> so i set a number at the end of ids
[04:43:07] <sunbeam> Cork: when I hover over any of them, a:hover
[04:43:14] <sunbeam> Another image should show
[04:43:22] <Cork> Mariaa: its not valid to have multiple id's with the same name
[04:43:37] <Cork> Mariaa: and it's arn't meant to be used for enumerable elements
[04:43:37] <dblosevn> Cork shes on the right path
[04:43:45] <Cork> Mariaa: thats what classes are for
[04:43:48] <Cork> dblosevn: not really
[04:43:53] <Mariaa> ni the ids will be different
[04:43:53] <dblosevn> well
[04:43:59] <rns> is there a list of premium jaqueryui themes out there anyone knows about?
[04:43:59] <Cork> adding numbers to id's is still wrong
[04:44:01] <Mariaa> like #div1 #div2
[04:44:02] <dblosevn> besides writing the code the right way lol
[04:44:25] <Mariaa> oh even adding numbers is wrong..
[04:44:30] <dblosevn> i tweaked the code she already had which is totally not reusable
[04:44:35] <Mariaa> ok i will try classes then
[04:44:44] <Cork> Mariaa: well it works, but it makes the code much much more complicated then it needs to be
[04:44:54] <sunbeam> Cork: you understand?
[04:45:24] <Cork> sunbeam: not fully, should the image be ontop of another image?
[04:45:40] <Cork> have you thought of using a png with transparency?
[04:46:22] <Mariaa> Cork: thats ok, i will do it this way, because i cannot rewrite whole thing with classes, i would need help wih jquery syntax for for loop though
[04:46:24] <Cork> Mariaa: do you have a code snippet i can look at?
[04:46:31] <Mariaa> yes
[04:46:34] <Mariaa> i will show you
[04:46:46] <Cork> Mariaa: if you have to use id's you need to list every one of them
[04:47:02] <Cork> $(#id1, #id2, #id3)
[04:47:06] <Cork> only way
[04:47:27] <dblosevn> theres related ids though
[04:47:35] <Mariaa> http://pastie.org/5061619 Cork
[04:47:44] <Cork> dblosevn: not really
[04:47:45] <Mariaa> Cork: list ids and run a loop?
[04:47:49] <Cork> related id is invalid dom
[04:47:56] <Cork> Mariaa: yes
[04:47:58] <Mariaa> or just listing them will call the method on all of them?
[04:48:18] <Cork> Mariaa: thats only the code
[04:48:29] <Cork> the structure of the page is needed for it to mean anything
[04:49:38] <dblosevn> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/27/
[04:49:46] <dblosevn> thats after i tweaked it
[04:49:56] <Cork> (its like giving someone a long complex relational sql query without the schema for the database)
[04:50:01] <Mariaa> yes thats the one, i had lost the link
[04:50:33] <Cork> from what i heard thats too little relation
[04:51:12] <dblosevn> #date-pick has related #hidden_date, #m #d #y
[04:51:44] <Cork> and from what you said its repeated
[04:51:54] <dblosevn> no
[04:52:01] <dblosevn> it would be if she wanted more then one
[04:52:18] <sunbeam> Cork: yea i use that, thats simply the problem
[04:52:26] <sunbeam> Cork: because of the transparancy you see the other image below
[04:52:36] <Mariaa> Cork: i will need multiple datepickers for different forms on one page
[04:52:45] <Mariaa> this works fine for one form, dblosevn fixed it
[04:53:36] <Cork> Mariaa: what you should do is to use class instead of the id's and find the parent that contains the related elements, and find the other related elements from there
[04:53:49] <Cork> that way you don't need to loop or repeat all the code
[04:54:27] <Mariaa> ah ok..i might repeat the code i guess
[04:57:13] <sunbeam> Cork: you understand?
[05:08:10] <Will|> can I get the previous value of a <select /> while processing a .change() event?
[05:08:46] <zest> Hi, can someone help me? Aside from messy html, I can't find anything why this jquery integration fails... http://jsfiddle.net/UsKmA/
[05:09:08] <Cork> sunbeam: sounds like i need to see it to grasp what you mean
[05:09:18] <zest> submit after adding more <input> to the form fails to post the new inputs..
[05:09:28] <Cork> Will|: not without storing the old value
[05:09:37] <Will|> hmm, ok
[05:09:45] <zest> only the original inputs are processed but not the appended ones..
[05:09:52] <zest> anyone know the answer?
[05:10:46] <Cork> zest: thats a very big exception
[05:10:59] <zest> what do you mean?
[05:11:26] <Cork> tag-soupe and error correction means you don't fully know how the dom structure looks like
[05:11:46] <Cork> s/how/what/
[05:12:39] <Cork> zest: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffiddle.jshell.net%2FUsKmA%2F1%2Fshow%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[05:13:12] <Cork> at minimum remove those stray tags and unclosed tags
[05:13:20] <gnarf> zest: live is deprecated
[05:13:22] <gnarf> see ?on
[05:13:22] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:13:35] <gnarf> and/or see ?live
[05:13:35] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[05:13:48] <gnarf> the docs for live tell you all about how to properly use on
[05:13:54] <gnarf> not that should stop anything
[05:13:56] <zest> Okay..
[05:14:14] <zest> alternate for live should fix my problem?\
[05:14:18] <Cork> no
[05:14:21] <Cork> but it should be done
[05:14:31] <zest> the html tidying up?
[05:14:36] <zest> Okay..
[05:14:39] <gnarf> zest: what exactly is the problem again?
[05:14:59] <zest> Hi, can someone help me? Aside from messy html, I can't find anything why this jquery integration fails... http://jsfiddle.net/UsKmA/
[05:15:04] <zest> submit after adding more <input> to the form fails to post the new inputs..
[05:15:07] <zest> only the original inputs are processed but not the appended ones..
[05:15:15] <gnarf> zest: sounds like those input's aren't inside the <form> tag to me
[05:15:16] <zest> there
[05:15:28] <zest> gnarf.. they are..
[05:15:45] <Cork> gnarf: will live work on id's ?
[05:16:13] <gnarf> zest: nope, they aren't
[05:16:29] <gnarf> zest: http://cl.ly/image/1V2O0Q0w0F0d
[05:16:44] <gnarf> zest: at least in chrome, there is no <form> tag enclosing that input
[05:17:09] <gnarf> although
[05:17:16] <gnarf> you didn't include any <form> tag in that demo
[05:17:29] <zest> check http://jsfiddle.net/UsKmA/
[05:17:30] <gnarf> or rather
[05:17:35] <gnarf> none of your inputs are in the form
[05:17:37] <zest> form tag is there
[05:17:43] <zest> so how do I make it so?
[05:17:50] <Cork> zest: its the error correction
[05:17:51] <gnarf> also, you really don't need the doctype stuff on fiddles
[05:17:57] <Cork> your adding form as a child to table
[05:18:00] <Cork> thats not valid
[05:18:27] <Cork> or a child of a tbody actually
[05:18:31] <gnarf> yeah
[05:18:35] <Cork> <TBODY><form name="form1" id="form1" action="http://www.nashvilleindian.com/ramesh/handler.php" method="post"><tr>
[05:18:35] <gnarf> it works inside a <td>
[05:18:48] <Cork> so error corrections moves the elements
[05:18:50] <gnarf> but you want to wrap the whole table
[05:19:06] <Cork> zest: so again, go through the validation and fix the thml
[05:19:08] <Cork> *html
[05:19:22] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1731213j0Z1m @zest
[05:19:34] <zest> hahahaha how stupid I was... Thanks for the help!
[05:19:54] <zest> man I should've asked 10 hours ago!
[05:20:06] <Cork> zest: always make sure you validate your html before error searching your js
[05:20:10] <zest> Thanks masters :)
[05:20:20] <Cork> casue if the html is broken you don't know what your working with
[05:20:21] <gnarf> P.S. - the clouds over NE indiana look awesome this morning
[05:20:27] <zest> Cork: will do, but this isn't my html..
[05:20:36] <Cork> zest: doesn't really matter :)
[05:20:50] <zest> :)
[05:21:03] <Cork> heck sometimes i even run server fetched html though tidy just to make sure i know what i get
[05:21:16] <Cork> (fetched from third-party)
[05:22:14] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1731213j0Z1m the webcam doesn't take a good enough picture of this cloud sea
[05:22:38] <Cork> your taking screenshots from your comp with a webcam??
[05:22:57] <Cork> ;p
[05:22:58] <gnarf> Cork: easier than uploading the image after snapping it
[05:23:18] <Cork> i meant thats the same image url you sent up there
[05:23:19] <gnarf> just cmd+shift+4 and draw a box and let cloudapp upload it
[05:23:20] <gnarf> :)
[05:23:25] <Cork> theres no cloud on it
[05:23:28] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/2B0I3f0b112T
[05:23:29] <gnarf> oh boo
[05:23:34] <Cork> lol
[05:23:34] <gob> THERE IS NO CLOUD
[05:23:42] <Cork> wow nice
[05:24:00] <gnarf> yeah, its way cooler looking out the window than the webcam can do
[05:24:16] <Cork> ya, i've seen similar first hand
[05:24:33] <Cork> feels like flying over a showy landscape
[05:24:37] <gnarf> P.S. Whoever invented the tech to pull off plane WiFi is on my list of thanks
[05:25:06] <dblosevn> lol, same tech used in cell phones
[05:25:18] <dblosevn> its a ground based LTEnetowrk
[05:25:29] <dblosevn> then bridged to wifi on the plane
[05:25:44] <gnarf> dblosevn: shhh
[05:26:13] <seutje> gnarf: whoever came up with the pricing models for it is my personal hero
[05:26:19] <dblosevn> i thought it was satellite for a while, then I actually looked it up and was like really thats LTE whys it so slow lmao
[05:26:48] <seutje> so a plane is essentially just a big ass flying phone? :D
[05:26:53] <gnarf> dblosevn: but yeah, its ground based, i know, but still some smart people made it reach 35k ft with <200ms pings
[05:26:54] <dblosevn> yep
[05:27:18] <dblosevn> defnitely
[05:27:27] <dblosevn> rarely a deadspot either
[05:27:34] <dblosevn> although theres always lone of site
[05:27:39] <dblosevn> *sight even
[05:27:44] <seutje> I'ma use this the next time I run into my niece who's afraid of flying
[05:28:00] <dblosevn> *line even
[05:28:05] <dblosevn> wow im done lol
[05:28:19] <seutje> "don't worry, it's essentially just a big flying phone, look: whoops, dropped it!"
[05:28:21] <gnarf> dblosevn: you've been here a while ;)
[05:28:30] <gnarf> seutje: lol
[05:28:45] <dblosevn> i hate it when they drop it
[05:28:46] <seutje> and u know how it looks when u drop an iphone...
[05:28:52] <dblosevn> turbuance sucks balls lol
[05:29:01] <seutje> lovely wording
[05:29:02] <dblosevn> its the new apple iplane
[05:29:08] <simpleweb> lol
[05:29:14] <seutje> more like iPlain
[05:29:19] <gnarf> 155 packets transmitted, 155 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 51.431/127.413/794.809/108.071 ms
[05:29:39] <gnarf> from 30k ft thats pretty crazy
[05:29:44] <dblosevn> ya
[05:30:40] <dblosevn> i usually jump on webdate and vid chat the whole time im in the air lmao
[05:31:13] <gnarf> i was thinking about skype calling someone
[05:31:17] <mazzachre> Can I manipulate pseudo elements via jquery? If I have a div and in css does a :after can I manipulate that element?
[05:31:18] <dblosevn> it works
[05:31:21] <gnarf> just to be like "hi"
[05:31:23] <dblosevn> video isnt too laggy
[05:31:33] <dblosevn> never tried audio
[05:31:48] <dblosevn> because streaming is against TOS and i didnt want to get caught
[05:32:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: lets do it!
[05:32:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: doesn't work, just tried :)
[05:32:26] <ryanneufeld> all the TV comercials say you can
[05:32:31] <ryanneufeld> boo
[05:32:46] <dblosevn> I have skyped on a plane before
[05:32:57] <gnarf> maybe i was just in a bad section
[05:33:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you guys at AOL yet?
[05:33:24] <ryanneufeld> yesh
[05:33:27] <ryanneufeld> just got here
[05:33:30] <gnarf> :/
[05:33:30] <ryanneufeld> 3hours sleep
[05:33:36] <gnarf> 0hrs for me
[05:33:50] <ryanneufeld> I'm considering bailing on the bowling
[05:33:56] <gnarf> i tried... no luck - layed down for like 4 hours then gave up
[05:34:06] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I kept waking up, didn't wanna over sleep
[05:34:07] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: eh - don't do it.. the party is worth it
[05:34:19] <ryanneufeld> it's 5:30am right now where I'm from
[05:35:04] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i might cab back to the hotel early from bowling
[05:35:09] <gnarf> but i'm gonna go at least for a bit
[05:35:15] <gnarf> and kick someones butt in golden tee if they have it
[05:35:16] <gnarf> :)
[05:35:20] <ryanneufeld> haha
[05:36:09] <Still> Would somebody know how to figure out what kind of charset a document uses (if it's not in the header) and how to convert a text from one charset to another?
[05:37:28] <dblosevn> clientside?
[05:37:33] <dblosevn> @Still
[05:37:43] <gnarf> ?g libiconv @Still
[05:37:44] <bot-t> Still, libiconv - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) - http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
[05:37:52] <gnarf> for server side
[05:38:03] <dblosevn> i was gonna say i dont think so lol
[05:38:46] <dblosevn> i usually use php iconv
[05:38:55] <Still> dblosevn preferebly. I'm getting data form a vbulletin as a javascript piece and some of the charcters are messed up because they're not using HTML entities.
[05:39:21] <dblosevn> dont know if your gonna make it happen clientside, might need to pass it back to the server for conversion
[05:39:57] <gnarf> Still: probably not on the client, ever
[05:40:20] <gnarf> Still: also, no chars should need to be encoded as html entities if the charset is utf-8
[05:40:25] <gnarf> cept < and "
[05:40:27] <gnarf> but yeah
[05:40:58] <gnarf> if the charset isn't in the headers, yell at whomever admins the server to add a charset header
[05:41:23] <gnarf> because their submission forms are probably broken with multibyte input anyway
[05:41:41] <gnarf> or at least a charset meta
[05:43:03] <dblosevn> my god, I just got done with a huge project for catepillar a couple months ago, they had people entering data from all over the world, the data was so mangled it was insane, took me hours to write scripts to clean it up, it was fine on the web but broke the hell out of the ipad apps plist file
[05:44:05] <gnarf> dblosevn: I look forward to the day there is only one charset ;)
[05:44:15] <Still> I doubt a meta will fit in. The forum supplies just a bunch of JS code.
[05:45:11] <dblosevn> this was definitely one of the more fun projects ive worked on, http://catkiosk.com/ (chrome only)
[05:45:44] <dblosevn> (1920x1080 res required)
[05:45:58] <gnarf> dblosevn: sorry, on an air ;)
[05:47:09] <dblosevn> gnarf: ya wpi;dnt play too nice in the air, highly bandwidth intensive
[05:47:32] <gnarf> dblosevn: no, i meant an air - macbook air, also in the air
[05:47:34] <dblosevn> its not really made to be view on the web, i localize it on hardware kiosks
[05:47:48] <dblosevn> it works on chrome for mac lol
[05:48:39] <dblosevn> oh screen size lol
[05:48:58] <dblosevn> youd see like the top left corner of it lmao
[05:49:05] <gnarf> dblosevn: had to double cmd+-
[05:49:12] <dblosevn> cant do it
[05:49:22] <dblosevn> well some screens you can
[05:49:29] <dblosevn> not the literture though
[05:49:37] <dblosevn> zooming out breaks the hell out of it
[05:51:11] <dblosevn> as mentioned it was made for specific hardware and software thats under my control so all thoughs quirks didnt matter :-D I wanted to make it fluid but they insisted on all the screens being 1920x1080
[05:51:48] <dblosevn> they flew me to paris to train there team how to use it lol
[05:52:08] <Still> dblosevn thanks for mentioning iconv, seems like a working workaround.
[05:52:32] <dblosevn> gnarf said it first i just mentioned the php extension :-)
[05:53:09] <dblosevn> probally would be faster to proxy the remote request through your server do the conversion and pass it back to the client
[05:53:32] <gnarf> dblosevn: so, CAT - you anywhere near peoria?
[05:53:34] <Still> That's my workaround. I just grab the content, use iconv and send a correspoing header.
[05:53:42] <Still> And thanks gnarf as well. :)
[05:54:03] <dblosevn> you can convert it after detection too
[05:54:34] <dblosevn> no, im in florida I dont work for CAT, one of my clients is a consulting firm that has CAT for a client
[05:54:53] <Still> currently i set it to convert to UTF-8 but I'll have to check out if anything breaks because of that.
[05:55:43] <gnarf> dblosevn: right-o
[05:56:45] <dblosevn> ya ive done big things with that firm, eg... like CAT, target, Coke
[06:03:01] <mms_> I am trying to use fadeIn/fadeOut on body/h2 element.  The logic causes the page to adjust its content by moving up when it fades out and moving down when it fades in.  The effect is not very good and I read it can be fixed by doing some height setting on container element
[06:10:22] <seutje> mms_: you could also just fade the opacity of the element without changing it's display type
[06:10:51] <mms_> seutje: how to do that ?
[06:11:22] <seutje> .animate('opacity', 0) ?
[06:11:53] <mms_> $('body h2').get(0).animate('opacity', 0); ?
[06:12:35] <mms_> $('body h2').animate('opacity', 0); ?
[06:13:02] <simpleweb> yes
[06:13:10] <simpleweb> should work
[06:16:05] <derPepo> no animate needs a hash :)
[06:16:32] <derPepo> $('body h2').animate({'opacity': 0}); works
[06:16:56] <simpleweb> right
[06:17:01] <mms_> did not work
[06:17:04] <mms_> nothing happens
[06:17:32] <derPepo> the element is display?
[06:17:34] <mms_> I want my text to fadeIn and fadeOut without causing the page elements to shiftup/down
[06:17:39] <mms_> derPepo: yes
[06:17:51] <derPepo> query? :)
[06:18:28] <mms_> var $element = $('body h2 div'); $element.animate('opacity', 0).delay(1000);
[06:21:09] <optraz> given an id of a table, i want to find within that table for a input name baz, what's the correct syntax?
[06:22:09] <simpleweb> @mms_ i think the animate function needs a hash like  "derPepo" said before.
[06:22:30] <simpleweb> ({opacity: 0})
[06:25:00] <lugzer> hey guys do tests on jsperf.com run for you?
[06:25:16] <mms_> simpleweb: lwet me try
[06:28:25] <johannes___> Hello
[06:28:32] <johannes___> Does someone have a solution for this problem: http://pastebin.com/9HgwUism
[06:28:32] <derPepo> Hello \o/
[06:28:51] <Still> lugzer "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://a.jsperf.com/benchmark-1.js" might be a reason why they don't run for me.
[06:28:54] <johannes___> It`s about finding the next element on another level
[06:29:00] <Still> hi derPepo
[06:29:08] <johannes___> without a fix path to it...
[06:29:12] <derPepo> @johannes___ please put it to jsfiddle
[06:29:24] <derPepo> http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:30:52] <angelazou> I have an HTML5 audio snippet that won't play in IE
[06:31:00] <lugzer> Still, I have seen that too but wanted to check if that's not my ISP blocking or smth. thanks man
[06:31:08] <angelazou> a live demo is at themobu.com/template4/index.html
[06:31:24] <simpleweb> member:johannes___: may with the children(); function?
[06:31:27] <angelazou> I have the .mp3 and .wav formats
[06:31:37] <angelazou> but IE9 doesn't seem to play either
[06:31:37] <johannes___> No, it is not a children...
[06:31:50] <johannes___> It`s an element somewhere in the DOM
[06:31:55] <angelazou> in addition, once it finished playing it's suppose to go to the next page
[06:32:03] <johannes___> I`m creating a jsfiddle example at the moment
[06:32:07] <angelazou> at least it did in my local copy, but not on the live copy
[06:32:13] <Still> Then maybe .find?
[06:32:22] <Still> @ johannes___
[06:33:02] <johannes___> .find() method allows us to search through the DESCENDANTS
[06:33:09] <johannes___> But it is not a descendant...
[06:33:14] <johannes___> Oder?
[06:34:04] <simpleweb> are u german :P
[06:34:12] <simpleweb> "oder"
[06:34:50] <derPepo> iÂ´m german too :)
[06:35:14] <Still> johannes___ $("body").find?
[06:35:39] <Still> Though I don't know how you're supposed to get the next one that way. ^^"
[06:35:48] <simpleweb> genau genommen bin ich Schweizer...
[06:35:55] <johannes___> I`m searching for a function that gives me the toggle_element 1 when I click on the trigger 1, and the element 2 when I click on trigger 2: http://jsfiddle.net/ZevSB/
[06:37:31] <quicksilver> johannes___: with your current structure it looks like you could navigate 'up' to the nearest ".ce" and then nextall to the next toggle_element
[06:37:35] <nisseni> I'm using a $.get to send an sms via a third party, it works, and all, but in chrome debugger I get this error: Origin http://isak.temp.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. - any idea what that means?
[06:38:10] <quicksilver> $(this).closest('.ce').nextAll('.toggle_element').toggle()
[06:38:14] <johannes___> @quicksilver: Yes, I could, but I want it to work even without a ce around both of the trigger and the element :)
[06:38:39] <johannes___> It should just be the next element in the source code,
[06:39:04] <johannes___> independent from the path from the trigger to the elementâ¦:)
[06:39:24] <derPepo> johannes___:  you need this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZevSB/2/
[06:40:04] <Still> nisseni probably a xss warning i'd think?!
[06:40:05] <quicksilver> johannes___: can't think of a simple way to do that. I would normally have a common parent or something.
[06:40:15] <johannes___> derPepo: Yes, but not for the trigger, but for the element below it :)
[06:40:23] <derPepo> ok i make it :)
[06:40:26] <optraz> given an id of a table, i want to find within that table for a input name baz, what's the correct syntax?
[06:40:28] <docmur> I want to pick up the clicks on the inner buttons toggle, reset etc... I'm trying to figure out what the click syntax would be in jquery, http://jsfiddle.net/nQ6pB/1/
[06:40:30] <quicksilver> johannes___: you could certainly write code which climbs up the tree until it finds a next element.
[06:40:32] <simpleweb> member:johannes___: like this? : http://jsfiddle.net/ZevSB/4/
[06:40:39] <hiall> is it possible to put a js object within a loop? like so http://paste2.org/p/2338649 but the function actually works?
[06:41:10] <johannes___> @simpleweb: Yes, like this, but working for both triggers :)
[06:41:18] <simpleweb> ah, kk
[06:42:30] <johannes___> The ugly solution would be a loop, with goes through the parents and always searches with nextAll through the elements of the certain parent :)
[06:42:38] <johannes___> But I would prefer a less nasty way :)
[06:43:15] <quicksilver> hiall: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Creating_closures_in_loops.3A_A_common_mistake
[06:43:19] <simpleweb> member:johannes___: this is quite nasty too :P: http://jsfiddle.net/ZevSB/5/
[06:44:04] <hiall> thanks quicksilver
[06:44:24] <johannes___> @simpleweb: Hehe, yes: But this only works for my two casesâ¦but I want be able to have a random structure of element and trigger, not only the 2 cases
[06:45:10] <simpleweb> ah okay, could be difficult...
[06:45:39] <quicksilver> johannes___: call .parents().each()
[06:45:46] <quicksilver> johannes___: and return false when you find a next.
[06:45:49] <quicksilver> not really hard.
[06:46:12] <goldstar> how do I iterate an ajax response obj which holds html ? $(ajaxResponseHtml).each("mydiv", function(){}); doesnt work :\
[06:46:28] <johannes___> Ahh, ok, each is a good way, I will try that...
[06:46:56] <ravenzz> goldstar $(ajaxResponseHtml).find("mydiv").each()
[06:47:16] <derPepo> every solution have smell :-( @johannes___
[06:47:30] <johannes___> :)
[06:47:48] <johannes___> Thank you all for helping me :O
[06:49:11] <mms_> derPepo: thanks for help..bye
[06:53:42] <docmur> Is there a way to apply a style with out reloading the page?
[06:53:55] <docmur> or trigger a style change, such as coloring a div
[06:54:05] <quicksilver> yes.
[06:54:16] <quicksilver> jQuery is all about such things
[06:54:21] <quicksilver> and none of them require reloading the page.
[06:54:26] <docmur> what would I look up?
[06:54:38] <ravenzz> javascript in general :)
[06:54:39] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[06:54:45] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[06:56:42] <PBDev> the validation plugin doesn't work
[06:56:50] <PBDev> QUESTION:?
[06:58:05] <goldstar> ravenzz: doesnt work if I replace mydiv with a class ?
[07:10:14] <eddiemonge> PBDev: you need to be more specific please
[07:10:17] <jlebrech> how do you stop bootstrap dropdowns from being dismissed for checkboxes?
[07:10:43] <PBDev> problem solved
[07:10:54] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: can you repeat that differently please? i don't understand the question
[07:11:20] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: I should probably be in a bootstrap channel, but it only has 5 users
[07:11:45] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: using bootstrap you can have dropdown menus, they are dismissed when you select an option
[07:12:03] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: but in my case I have more than one option
[07:12:53] <eddiemonge> so its a multiselect option? got any example code?
[07:13:09] <jlebrech> just from here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#dropdowns
[07:13:19] <jlebrech> except that my uls
[07:13:23] <jlebrech> have checkboxes
[07:14:00] <eddiemonge> so you basically want a multi-select dropdown box?
[07:14:59] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: if that exists for bootstrap, yes. I would have thought they'd have a callback for post selection
[07:15:53] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: this is one of the reasons i dont like bootstrap.
[07:17:05] <jlebrech> e.stopPropagation?
[07:17:58] <sonja> hello
[07:18:08] <goldstar> how do I iterate an ajax response obj which holds html ? $(ajaxResponseHtml).each(".myclass", function(){}); doesnt work :\
[07:18:27] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: looking at the code. dont like their code style guide. let me see if i can figure it out real quick
[07:18:44] <jlebrech> i think i've found what to do
[07:18:51] <jlebrech> it's on stackoverflow
[07:18:57] <sonja> I want the page to use .text() whenever something on a dropdown <select><option> is selected. which other function do i need?
[07:18:57] <jlebrech> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10480697/keep-bootstrap-dropdown-open-on-click
[07:19:28] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: cheers eddie
[07:19:57] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: sorry, dont see an easy/quick way to do that.
[07:20:14] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: i've figured it out.
[07:33:42] <PBDev> QUESTION: how do I make the email validator work?
[07:33:54] <PBDev> so far what works is that it warns if the field is empty.
[07:34:08] <PBDev> I tried adding the rule and the email method but it didn't work
[07:45:28] <TheBrayn> how can I do something like this: http://www.dailycoding.com/Posts/default_text_fields_using_simple_jquery_trick.aspx with the CJuiDatePicker input fields?
[07:45:49] <TheBrayn> I tried to add a class with the htmlOptions array but it didn't show up
[07:46:41] <TheBrayn> uhm wrong channel
[08:04:53] <angelazou> how do I tell how long did it take to load a file?
[08:05:17] <angelazou> I have a link that triggers a sound play when it's clicked
[08:05:30] <angelazou> once the sound is finished the page would go on
[08:05:46] <angelazou> problem is, I also want to handle that for users that have slow connection
[08:06:00] <angelazou> don't want to have them wait for the audio if it's taking too long
[08:06:14] <angelazou> so how do I do a time counter for the loading process
[08:06:21] <faraway> angelazou: do oyu use a library to load the audio file ?
[08:06:57] <d4ndy> Hello
[08:07:12] <d4ndy> what is the correct method for removing 'checked' status from a input:radio please?
[08:07:34] <d4ndy> I've tried prop('checked',false), attr('checked',false), removeAttr('checked'). Nothing works
[08:08:46] <pachet> $('input:radio').prop('checked', false)
[08:08:49] <pachet> is the correct way
[08:10:01] <faraway> d4ndy: sure that it sin't something else. are the radios in this jsfiddle unchecked for you ? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/BhM3B/
[08:10:14] <d4ndy> no they're not faraway
[08:10:18] <eddiemonge> d4ndy: are you looking in IE?
[08:10:22] <d4ndy> FX
[08:10:29] <d4ndy> 15.0.1
[08:10:48] <d4ndy> pachet: thank you, I've tried that but no luck
[08:11:22] <faraway> d4ndy: works here with ff 15.0.1
[08:11:29] <eddiemonge> d4ndy: are these checked or not checked? http://jsfiddle.net/BhM3B/1/
[08:11:58] <d4ndy> hmm, seems I was being too specific with my selector
[08:12:05] <d4ndy> or rather putting the filter in the wrong place
[08:12:20] <d4ndy> $('input:radio[value="shipping"]').attr('checked',false); I guess it's not valid to put the [...] there?
[08:13:42] <d4ndy> ugh, I'm an idiot - using the correct attribute name would help, doh
[08:13:59] <d4ndy> tyvm pachet, faraway and eddiemonge, much appreciated
[08:14:20] <faraway> d4ndy: shame on you ;)
[08:15:11] <d4ndy> silly mistakes = perhaps the best indicator that it's time to step away from the computer :|
[08:15:24] <faraway> d4ndy: if something like this is not working first check if the length of your result set is not 0
[08:15:56] <faraway> d4ndy: then you could try to e.g. make a border around it to see if you selected the right element
[08:16:26] <Tobbi_> Hey. does anyone know of a jquery function that fires whenever the text in a textbox was changed? No matter if this was done through user input or JS code?
[08:16:54] <faraway> Tobbi_: if you change with js you need to trigger the change event yourself
[08:17:01] <Tobbi_> hmm...
[08:17:03] <Tobbi_> okay.
[08:17:59] <faraway> Tobbi_: for there other situations keypress and change should work well
[08:18:20] <Tobbi_> This fires immediately after the change or after the textbox has lost focus?
[08:18:25] <angelazou> faraway: nope, just HTML5 audio and source tags
[08:18:42] <angelazou> what kind of library are out there/
[08:18:47] <faraway> Tobbi_: change after the loose of focus, keypress everytime a ke was pressed (which does not need to change the content, e.g. arrow keys)
[08:19:08] <Still> Is there a way to change the position of a scrollbar using jquery? It does seem silly but who knows ...
[08:19:14] <Tobbi_> hmm, maybe I'll just bind keypress and then fire the other event programmatically.
[08:19:15] <faraway> Tobbi_: key press (for every input event, even if the key is hold down)
[08:20:13] <faraway> angelazou: if you only use html5 there are event for the audio tag , where you can imho  listen to the play progress or load progess
[08:20:35] <angelazou> faraway: can you point me to some documentation?
[08:21:08] <d4ndy> faraway: thanks for the tip! :) Have a good one
[08:25:59] <noxoc> I have an array called callStack filled up with functions, So if I got this right $.when.apply(this, callStack).then([â¦]); should call each function in callStack. But it doesn't â¦ what did I miss?
[08:29:00] <ralphholzmann> does $.fn.animate still return a promise?
[08:29:50] <ajpiano> ralphholzmann: it never did, you call .promise() after you call .animate and it givse you the promise
[08:31:06] <ralphholzmann> ajpiano: ty
[08:32:26] <docmur> I know I'm making a mistake but I can't see it, http://jsfiddle.net/gKqPc/1/  I want to add the color to the div

[08:53:55] <AdamPDotty> docmur, dont you need an event handler?
[08:55:55] <Andrey_V> Hello. Is it possbile to manually prevent animated set of jquery objects from triggering resolve in the end of animation?
[08:56:36] <melvinram> I'm trying to use the jquery plugin on http://www.fitpallet.com.php53-12.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/ but I'm having problems with it when the window is resized.
[08:57:29] <melvinram> I try to change the width of the .slide div's to be 100% after the window resizes so that it still works but it doesn't seem to be taking effect.
[08:57:37] <melvinram> Anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
[08:58:48] <melvinram> *sorry, i meant query cycle plugin
[08:58:55] <melvinram> *jquery
[09:00:18] <FiLeVeR10> what are you trying to do with it?
[09:01:42] <melvinram> I'm trying to cycle the different div's but they have a width of 100% and it's not resetting the widths when the window is resized
[09:02:26] <FiLeVeR10> well cycle explicitly sets the dimensions, so you'll have to undo that
[09:03:20] <melvinram> well i have it working fine on http://www.stratocommunications.com/ where I'm doing exactly the same thingâ¦ but for some reason on this new site it's not taking effect.
[09:04:23] <melvinram> FiLeVeR10: I basically had it reset the widths whenever the window resized using $(window).resize(function() { $('.cycler').css('width', '100%'); $('.cycler .slide').css('width', '100%'); });
[09:05:02] <FiLeVeR10> oh, i did it through cycle on one i had where the height varied
[09:05:30] <FiLeVeR10> although the width doesn't seem to change on the second one you sent
[09:05:58] <FiLeVeR10> melvinram: before: function onAfter(){ var sh = $(this).height(); $(this).parent().animate({height: sh}, 'slow'); }
[09:06:35] <FiLeVeR10> but that's for each slide, it could be easily changes for the parent though
[09:07:01] <FiLeVeR10> why not set the width to 100% !important
[09:07:06] <FiLeVeR10> it should override inline styles
[09:07:16] <FiLeVeR10> then you won't need a resize function
[09:07:28] <FiLeVeR10> width:100% !important;
[09:07:39] <bil`> there an easy way to consolidate this into one on() method?
[09:07:39] <bil`> 		$('criteria-row').on({'click', 'a.criteria-add', addRow});
[09:07:40] <bil`> 		$('criteria-row').on({'click', 'a.criteria-remove', removeRow});
[09:07:53] <melvinram> FiLeVeR10: let me try !important
[09:08:14] <FiLeVeR10> bil`: use toggle
[09:08:41] <FiLeVeR10> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[09:08:42] <melvinram> FiLeVeR10: hey that worked!!
[09:08:47] <melvinram> FiLeVeR10: awesome. thanks.
[09:09:02] <FiLeVeR10> np man, i use !important a lot for print stylesheets to override js
[09:09:20] <bil`> The add and remove methods are bound to two separate buttons not sure what toggle would do?
[09:09:51] <bil`> its not like a hide/show type thing
[09:09:54] <FiLeVeR10> bil`: oh, do you have an example? or could u set one up on jsfiddle?
[09:10:24] <ExnnTech> Hey
[09:10:31] <bil`> basically i just want to use an event map for on() but I'm not sure how to do that with a target selector and event delegation
[09:11:21] <pachet> you cant
[09:11:56] <bil`> bummer
[09:11:59] <FiLeVeR10> yea, that seems odd
[09:12:06] <pachet> even if you specify an event map, .on() still accepts a singular selector arg
[09:12:44] <FiLeVeR10> you can always do it by class with each?
[09:14:07] <NoiseEee> .on('click','a',function(ev) { //find out the class of the a clicked, and do something })
[09:14:52] <FiLeVeR10> ^awesome
[09:15:07] <docmur> If I return an event from PHP such as .addClass();  How do I apply that to a DIV called $(#u3) when I come back from post $('#u3').callback; didn't work
[09:15:13] <docmur> is there an execute command?
[09:15:13] <bil`> thats a good idea thanks
[09:16:28] <pachet> docmur: er, you are probably chasing eval(), but there are better ways to do what you're trying to do
[09:17:39] <docmur> Well in this case the PHP needs to evalutate a bunch of situations and do some mysql work and then depending on the state of the mysql for the user I want to apply a color coded class to a div aka change it's color and the easist place to do that is in PHP when I can play with / view all the user status codes
[09:18:04] <shoky> return data, not code
[09:18:06] <pachet> why not just pass back a class name and an id to attach it to
[09:19:12] <someprimetime> anyone @ the html5 con in SF today?
[09:22:41] <docmur> Hmm okay so now the echo is only the class name to apply to the DIV but it only works once because I need to remove the old class so I'm doing $(userDiv).removeClass().addClass(text);
[09:23:10] <pachet> ?
[09:23:12] <docmur> so I think the best idea is to return an array with the class to remove and the one to add
[09:26:42] <gabrieluk> hi, is it recommended to put all my jquery in the end of the html, just before </body> tag? Will it happens to find a plugin tht needs to be in the <head> by any means?
[09:27:10] <pachet> just put dom dependent stuff before </body>
[09:27:14] <gabrieluk> if i take the jquery from google, should i also put before </body>?
[09:28:13] <gabrieluk> pachet, you mean, the things that are not libs?
[09:28:21] <pachet> no
[09:28:36] <pachet> i mean, the things that need the dom to be parsed
[09:29:03] <pachet> just use <script></script></body> as your dom manip entrypoint
[09:29:36] <gabrieluk> ah, you mean things that the markup needs to be there in order to the js be activated?
[09:29:42] <gabrieluk> that need*
[09:29:54] <gabrieluk> yes, i understand now
[09:30:17] <pachet> or hey, this is #jquery -- you can always just  $(doWhatever) if it floats your boat
[09:30:23] <gabrieluk> so in that case, js lib is out. where it goes? head i presume
[09:30:52] <gabrieluk> pachet, sure, i'm just looking for best practises
[09:32:04] <gabrieluk> pachet, but hold on 1 sec. what if i use something like uglify?
[09:32:27] <gabrieluk> wouldn't it concatenate everything and put in 1 place?
[09:33:11] <pachet> well, that depends on how you use it
[09:33:22] <pachet> but assuming yes, what you'd typically do is just call some function to get you started
[09:33:37] <gabrieluk> i never used, i should have read the docs before asking...but, you know, i'm curious
[09:33:53] <pachet> so in your head you have your minified stuff, then just <script>mynamespace.init();</script></body>
[09:34:26] <gabrieluk> ahh, alright, that makes sense
[09:34:59] <pachet> and that's just an example, do whatever works
[09:35:17] <gabrieluk> sure, but i will follow, seems neat
[09:35:44] <gabrieluk> i have used all in the head till, not minified x.x
[09:36:07] <gabrieluk> joking
[09:36:37] <gabrieluk> well, thanks for the tips
[09:37:09] <pachet> no sweat
[09:43:18] <gabrieluk> how big is the limit of jquery plugins should i be using in a page? will that be measured just in how muck kb of code i have or in the number of plugins i have installed. Wll what plugin is doing influence also in determining a sane balance ?
[09:44:24] <gabrieluk> I mean, if a plugin is doing some sliding will differ from something that swap css classes, etc
[09:44:44] <Turaiel> Hi. Can anyone explain to me why setting .css() with an element's background color stops :hover and :active from working in the original CSS file? http://testing.brandonjd.net/portfolio.php If you click one of the categories, their hover highlight stops working
[09:45:40] <Brodingo> Turaiel has to do with css specificity
[09:46:08] <Brodingo> Turaiel instead of using .css() its usually better to toggle classes for certain states
[09:46:30] <Turaiel> Alright, thanks
[09:46:33] <Turaiel> I'll look into that
[09:46:57] <soozler> Hey.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12900105/close-button-to-facebox-jquery-box-closes-master-page-not-popup
[09:47:16] <soozler> Anyone have any ideas why this ^ behavior is occuring?
[09:48:19] <gabrieluk> what is the maximum amount of code, in kb, one should have in order to keep a page light weight?
[09:48:25] <Eviltwin> 0.5
[09:48:27] <pachet> 0
[09:48:30] <BillCriswell> 0.2
[09:48:48] <NoiseEee> 14 codes
[09:48:53] <gabrieluk> 0? x.x
[09:49:22] <jrajav> The only truly lightweight page is a static page
[09:49:35] <BillCriswell> Unless it's a heavy static page.
[09:49:40] <jrajav> Right
[09:49:58] <amcsi> hey
[09:49:58] <amcsi> who is this webchatuser guy?
[09:50:01] <pachet> yeah preferably the page itself should be 0kb
[09:50:07] <pachet> actually if you can avoid having to do the request altogether
[09:50:10] <amcsi> he froze my xchat-2 with his comment
[09:50:25] <BillCriswell> amcsi: Not sure I'm following.
[09:51:03] <amcsi> xchat-2 is an IRC client that has a bug that when certain characters appear in the scrollback log, xchat-2 crashes
[09:51:13] <jrajav> amcsi: Sounds like you need to upgrade to a different client
[09:51:19] <BillCriswell> amcsi: That sucks.
[09:51:23] <amcsi> and he typed some weird random characters a few weeks ago
[09:51:30] <amcsi> can you recommend me something good?
[09:51:32] <gabrieluk> pachet, but if is 0 and there's no request there's no fun :(. at least 0.1 k
[09:52:01] <Eviltwin> amcsi: irssi is my personal favorite IRC client
[09:52:18] <BillCriswell> gabrieluk: There's so many if situations when you're talking about page size. Ideally you want the least amount of code that makes sense.
[09:52:19] <pachet> i prefer to just print the page out on printer paper and tape it to all the clients monitors before they get to work
[09:52:26] <pachet> they dont even have to turn the computer on, most days
[09:52:43] <BillCriswell> pachet: Now that's optimization.
[09:52:47] <Eviltwin> Colloquy is less feature rich but much prettier
[09:52:50] <Eviltwin> Unfortunately it is Mac-only
[09:52:54] <BillCriswell> You're even cutting donw on their electric bill.
[09:53:04] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: That what you use?
[09:53:10] <Eviltwin> I use irssi
[09:53:26] <pachet> irssi for the greater good
[09:53:31] <BillCriswell> I recently switched to LImeChat, liking it so far.
[09:54:36] <amcsi> Is there a gui version of irssi?
[09:54:55] <pachet> where's the fun in that!
[09:55:29] <Whirl3d> the fun in that is being able to be hardcore...
[09:55:32] <amcsi> I'm using windows. The terminals suck here, so no cli program makes me happy here
[09:56:07] <soozler> ?nbvc
[09:56:08] <bot-t> soozler, Couldn't find "nbvc" in jQuery Docs.
[09:56:13] <docmur> I'm watching four buttons for a click, after the click is detected a flag changes but then I want to execute a post, the thing is the post needs to execute when any buttons is clicked so I watch the buttons then I watch generic button, I think this is causing the issue where I have to press the button twice to post. http://jsfiddle.net/dZG9W/  What would be the rigth way to do this
[09:56:13] <Whirl3d> try trillian if you want a pretty gui/chat client/irc client. It's pretty cute.
[09:57:41] <Whirl3d> docmur, where's the html part of your fiddle?
[09:59:33] <Whirl3d> <--tucks tail behind legs and leaves channel
[09:59:44] <mike029> hi everyone, this is a very noob question but google isn't being too cooperative with me searching....i have an span element with a 'content' section that i would like to grab. basically i want to grab this date info
[09:59:44] <mike029> <span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2012-10-20T20:45:00+08:00\">1350737100</span>
[10:00:27] <BillCriswell> mike029: You're looking for a content "attribute"
[10:00:54] <mike029> ok, i tried field_date = $(obj.node.field_date).content()  (switching the html/text for content) but didnt work
[10:01:28] <BillCriswell> mike029: Do you want the text inside the tag or the 'content' attribute?
[10:01:40] <mike029> the text inside the 'content' attribute
[10:03:09] <mike029> so switching the ".content()" i guessed at into ".attr('content')" should do it?
[10:03:10] <docmur> here is the fiddle with the html code: http://jsfiddle.net/dZG9W/3/
[10:04:08] <mike029> billcriswell, thanks, one problem down
[10:04:15] <BillCriswell> mike029: No problem.
[10:14:39] <docmur> nm it's not a button issue it's jQuery / Javascript have latency issues again .....
[10:18:32] <mephux> is it possible to abort an ajax request in the completed callback?
[10:18:51] <mephux> or can i stop the success callback from being ran inside the completed callback?
[10:20:34] <sparuvu> hey guys...
[10:20:35] <BillCriswell> mephux: Are you doing it based on the result of the request?
[10:20:41] <sparuvu> what is the result of this ?
[10:20:42] <sparuvu> parseInt("010");
[10:20:47] <jerware> moin.
[10:20:55] <sparuvu> and why is it not returning the 10 ?
[10:20:57] <BillCriswell> sparuvu: It's 8
[10:21:04] <sparuvu> why is it 8 ?
[10:21:05] <BillCriswell> You want parseInt("010", 10)
[10:21:09] <BillCriswell> octal
[10:21:26] <sparuvu> oh
[10:21:52] <mephux> BillCriswell: ah, so the completed request happens after the success callback?
[10:21:57] <sparuvu> thanks BillCriswell
[10:22:04] <BillCriswell> sparuvu: No problem!
[10:22:19] <BillCriswell> mephux: The request completes then the callback is run.
[10:22:28] <sparuvu> and also why is this 5 * 1.015 returning 5.375
[10:22:37] <sparuvu> instead of 5.075
[10:22:40] <mephux> BillCriswell: which callback is first after the request.. complete or success?
[10:24:10] <Chris_CC> hi
[10:24:38] <Chris_CC> how would i go about using a .php file within an append something like $('#shout'+shout_id).append('php file name here');
[10:25:07] <bil`> Am I using $compile wrong in this directive? myName isn't being parsed by AngularJS https://gist.github.com/d9b5de47267a31d1fe73
[10:25:51] <BillCriswell> sparuvu: I have no idea why it would be returning 5.375 unless there's something else going on I'm unaware of.
[10:25:58] <bil`> er wrong chan
[10:26:44] <Chris_CC> join #ajax
[10:26:55] <BillCriswell> mephux: Yes. Take a look at the Callback Function Queues here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:27:39] <BillCriswell> Chris_CC: You want to add the content of a php file to a div?
[10:27:53] <Chris_CC> BillCriswell: exactly
[10:28:42] <BillCriswell> Chris_CC: $('#some_id').load('foo.php') should work ( assuming it's on the same domain ).
[10:28:54] <BillCriswell> Chris_CC: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:29:04] <Chris_CC> hanks will give that a shot
[10:30:09] <Chris_CC> BillCriswell:  perfect, thanks :D
[10:30:18] <BillCriswell> Chris_CC: No problem.
[10:45:40] <docmur> can I bind a child div to a button so that when I toggle() that html code shows under the button?

[10:47:29] <Swizzy> could someone recommend me a standalone jquery lib for a one page website (smooth scrolling)?
[10:47:54] <serp1> @Swizzy jquery.min.js
[10:48:28] <schtinky> got a .click event that (a) updates the clicked button text, (b) does an ajax call, and (c) resets the clicked button text to its original state....
[10:48:31] <Swizzy> @serpl - so I should just use native jquery functions? hmm idk I'm pretty noob at javascript
[10:48:51] <schtinky> however (a) doesn't happen until (b) is complete for some reason
[10:49:04] <serp1> @Swizy this is why sites gots heavy :)
[10:49:19] <serp1> try to use jquery not more plugins
[10:49:21] <serp1> ;)
[10:49:22] <schtinky> so b hardly happens since c immediately resets it... anyone know why this is?
[10:50:01] <Swizzy> ~serpl haha fair point I guess - but it is just for a one page website (school project for tommorow) and it can be upto 45mb so thats not a problem, I just want something that looks good and presentable
[10:50:07] <schtinky> I tried creating a .mousedown event and changing the button text... then calling .click. This works but isn't perfect
[10:50:16] <serp1> for smooth scrolli you can search for scrollto plugin
[10:50:24] <serp1> is the lightest i founded
[10:50:29] <serp1> @Swizzy
[10:50:30] <Swizzy> @serpl - it will never be "online" its just a little demonstration to get extra points
[10:50:35] <Swizzy> ahh right thanks buddy
[10:50:42] <serp1> np :)
[10:50:45] <schtinky> Is there something about jquery that it's not immediately updating the button and wants to run the ajax call first, even though it's lower in the code exec?
[10:50:48] <docmur> can you attach a HTML class to the .html() method?
[10:51:06] <serp1> $.scrollto('element',duration, options);
[10:51:12] <Swizzy> also, any other plugins that you would recommend for a one-page website for fancy stuff? the page contains mainly text, some images and 2 videos
[10:51:34] <dblosevn> schtinky: nope its your code, I do that kind of stuff all the time
[10:51:43] <Swizzy> like, it just needs to look impressive
[10:51:58] <serp1> well there are many many out there
[10:52:00] <serp1> it depends
[10:52:05] <serp1> try searching on google
[10:52:07] <abrkn> how would i run this code http://jsfiddle.net/abrkn/pCqp4 in the sequence: step1 --> step2a and step2b in parallel --> step3?
[10:52:13] <serp1> for best jquery effects plugins
[10:52:16] <serp1> something like this
[10:52:35] <Swizzy> yeah I tried google but I only got outdated stuff from 2008 lol
[10:52:43] <Swizzy> yeah i'll try that thanks
[10:53:04] <serp1> well for animations there was another fantastic js library which is not jquery sec ..
[10:53:07] <dblosevn> schtinky: example plz
[10:53:28] <Swizzy> oh right - are you talking about raphael.js or something like that?
[10:53:39] <serp1> nono
[10:53:45] <serp1> somenthing like fabouls.js
[10:53:47] <Swizzy> like when I googled for cool plugins I only got stuff like fittext.js
[10:53:52] <Swizzy> ah right I'll check that out
[10:53:52] <serp1> in a while http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/10-impressive-javascript-animation-frameworks/
[10:54:38] <Swizzy> thanks i'm reading it nwo
[10:54:39] <serp1> http://script.aculo.us/
[10:54:39] <Swizzy> *now
[10:54:41] <serp1> this man ;)
[10:54:45] <schtinky> Here's the simplified situation. The button should say "posting" while the ajax call runs its course. http://pastebin.com/7CqHpkth
[10:55:11] <Swizzy> wow scriptaclous looks awesome
[10:55:14] <schtinky> but instead, it runs the ajax, THEN upates to "posting" (which is immediately replaced by "Submit") again
[10:55:18] <serp1> yep really!
[10:55:21] <Swizzy> used by nasa hahahahaa wow
[10:55:27] <serp1> but it is different from jquery take care ;)
[10:55:42] <serp1> eheheh
[10:55:50] <serp1> jquery too is used by nasa i think
[10:56:02] <serp1> jquery is just used on bilions sites
[10:56:04] <serp1> just
[10:56:35] <Swizzy> yeah jquery is everywhere
[10:58:02] <dblosevn> schtinky: update the text of your button before the ajax call, it may be executing so fast you neever actually see it, other then that that code looks as if it should work just fine, although what you showe me and what your using are 2 diferent things
[10:58:18] <serp1> go with scriptacoulus if you want cool animations
[10:58:34] <serp1> then if you rock use some html5 animation library
[10:58:35] <serp1> :)
[10:58:42] <Swizzy> aww yeah
[10:58:48] <serp1> instead of js or flash
[10:59:30] <Swizzy> thanks for all the help, im going to get off now, thanks!
[10:59:32] <NoiseEee> there is 0 reason to choose scriptaculous
[10:59:39] <NoiseEee> a) its based on prototype.js
[10:59:49] <NoiseEee> b) you will find much the same in either jqueryui or other plugins
[11:00:06] <NoiseEee> choosing, and suggesting scriptaculous in 2012/2013 is enough to get you banned from the interwebs
[11:00:29] <dblosevn> ^^
[11:01:13] <NoiseEee> also, @ schtinky: http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png / http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:03:55] <converge> does someone here uses jquery load with cake ?
[11:03:58] <converge> *cakephp
[11:04:01] <abrkn> any deferred experinced users? trying to group async tasks to run this code http://jsfiddle.net/abrkn/pCqp4 in the sequence: step1 --> step2a and step2b in parallel --> step3
[11:06:43] <danzik17> abrkn: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/pCqp4/1/
[11:07:10] <schtinky> Yeah this is bizarre. if I put an alert() just below $("#comment_submission_form_submit_button").val("Posting"); the button changes to posting
[11:07:31] <docmur> Is there a site where you can paste both php and jquery together?
[11:07:31] <schtinky> without it, the whole ajax call (longer than 2 seconds) happens and the button doesn't chang euntil after it finishes
[11:08:01] <abrkn> danzik17: yes, exactly. could you expand upon the example by having step2 add a step4 to the queue? (i'm making a game and need this sequencing for my display)
[11:08:13] <schtinky> something interesting, when I click the button to submit, it stays downclicked (i.e. kinda "stuck") until the ajax call is finished, then finally releases
[11:08:35] <schtinky> btw, my ajax call is set to async: false
[11:09:21] <dblosevn> ... well duh, aync false blocks and the button text wont change until it completes
[11:09:23] <shoky> ?async
[11:09:24] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâs ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[11:10:15] <shoky> same goes for alerts, pretty much
[11:10:24] <Already> I hope it's okay to ask questions not directly related to jquery but to webdesign in general? Would anybody happen to have a tool or hint on how to "create" a color scheme based on a background-image?
[11:10:51] <abrkn> danzik17: so it would act more like a queue with parallelization
[11:12:15] <danzik17> abrkn: since you have this example to work off of, why don't you try it and see if you can get it going and ask questions as needed?  alternatively you could use jQuery.queue for this ( which i have no experience in using ).
[11:13:12] <abrkn> danzik17: ok, i'm very unfamiliar with these sort of "timelines" and the whole animation sequencing and parallelization has become quite the challenge
[11:15:59] <aro> is there a way when using $.load to parse elements in that response?
[11:17:05] <tlkr> aro use the complete callback function, the first parameter is responseText
[11:17:12] <shoky> abrkn: if you want two steps to happen in parallel to the same element, use  'queue:false' option for .animate()
[11:17:19] <aro> i am already using that
[11:18:01] <docmur> what happening is my button will fire the click event because I can alert after the click() method and I can alert in the callback to the post but for some reason the code in the callback isn't happening.  I can post the code with out the PHP http://jsfiddle.net/RRqK9/18/  For some reason the buttons require me to double click them to fire after the callback in the post
[11:18:19] <tlkr> aro so what exactly is the problem? The text is in that parameter so you can manipulate it as you like.
[11:19:47] <black_warlock> guys
[11:19:49] <black_warlock> hello
[11:20:07] <tlkr> hello black_warlock
[11:20:24] <black_warlock> here there is tornado ........
[11:20:37] <serp1> sorry i read now @NoiseEee wo?
[11:20:57] <serp1> better animations then scriptacolous?
[11:22:07] <serp1> *what? do you think jquery has better animations then scriptacolous â¦ maybe you do not used jquery and you didn't know about
[11:22:30] <black_warlock> i have a list of ul items
[11:22:36] <Brodingo> wut
[11:23:08] <black_warlock> when the <li> has class selected i need to open every parent ul how can i do it
[11:24:09] <Already> $(this).child("ul").each( ... ) maybe?
[11:24:22] <black_warlock> hum
[11:24:23] <serp1> @NoiseEee in 2012/2013 you can only think on html5 + css3 that is the future, not js
[11:24:41] <rodfersou> hi everyone
[11:24:44] <serp1> for web animations
[11:26:10] <rodfersou> is there a way to change the default jquery ui navigation keys?

[11:29:22] <black_warlock> inside pip1 there is one selected element
[11:29:43] <black_warlock> how can i let jquery opens each parent ul ?
[11:29:52] <black_warlock> to the first lvl ul ?
[11:29:53] <serp1> please guys use user highlith
[11:29:58] <serp1> @ i mean :/
[11:31:12] <brass> @black_warlock, what do you mean?
[11:31:32] <black_warlock> i mean every <ul> its closed at the start
[11:31:53] <black_warlock> via dynamic code i get .selected class on items
[11:32:37] <black_warlock> the selected item must be visible , and to do that i have to let every parent ul open
[11:33:42] <Kcko^GOD> @black_warlock:  open each UL on page OR  all parent UL in DOM structure of selected item? Its different ...
[11:34:02] <black_warlock> the condition is : if there is one li selected then parent ul css display:inline
[11:34:53] <black_warlock> but must be every ul connected to that <li> to show it out
[11:35:33] <black_warlock> see the exemple, if pip1 and subTyttis1 are not opened you cant see the selected itm
[11:36:16] <black_warlock> must open each parent ul till they are finished
[11:40:01] <Kcko^GOD> @black_warlock: try something like this        $("li.selected").parents("ul").show();
[11:44:44] <mike029> hi, is there an easy way to stop all scripts running on a page? im trying to create a timeout function to just make everything stop instead of just running forever (for whatever reason, bad connection, misc.)
[11:51:55] <black_warlock> Kcko^GOD i tried exactlly that
[11:52:51] <Kcko^GOD> black_warlock  try this, its even better   $("li.selected").parents("li").find("button").trigger("click");   // to end of code
[11:52:58] <Kcko^GOD> but ur code is messy :/
[11:53:23] <black_warlock> it works man
[11:54:54] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/43/
[11:54:56] <black_warlock> see ?

[12:13:40] <Kcko> Chris_CC second argument of LOAD function is callback fn
[12:13:56] <Chris_CC> Kcko: thanks all done :)

[12:18:08] <monostar> hello. how can we load .js code or file on each ajax page load within a div container?
[12:18:41] <Kcko> monostar with $.getScript  // see documentation
[12:19:03] <monostar> when the page loads for first time, the share button is showing fine, when we click on videos within div container the share button is lost http://shortefilms.com
[12:19:53] <Kcko> monostar  show ur code  not all web
[12:20:01] <monostar> the share button is shown above the video block beside the heading to the right, once we click on any video in the right panel, the share button is lost
[12:20:44] <wunderCatze> Sorry for not-technical questions, but why can't I join php channel? "Invite only".
[12:20:51] <monostar> same happens with the videos displayed in the below body container in big block with being watched | most viewed | recently watched
[12:21:27] <monostar> ok
[12:21:36] <Kcko> monostar: its ur web? if yep, show code ...
[12:21:40] <booey> Do spelling typos warrant a jQuery UI bug report?
[12:21:45] <monostar> yes
[12:23:10] <monostar> this is the code for the video player displayed on index page - http://pastebin.com/sfspsQ6a
[12:24:06] <gabrieluk> hello, trying to structure my css to fit id's that are targeted by jquery. should i create a new style sheet, only for jquery id's?
[12:24:31] <monostar> supporting javascript code for the share button which is included only in global header file - http://pastebin.com/H3i5gQiL
[12:28:00] <wunderCatze> @monostar what is this: x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
[12:28:02] <wunderCatze> ?
[12:28:05] <monostar> this is the code for the videos displayed on right panel which triggers the ajax call when clicked - http://pastebin.com/Zy82Qcje and get_ep_video is the function called
[12:28:20] <Eviltwin> wunderCatze: It's called JavaScript
[12:30:10] <wunderCatze> I tought it was Javascript
[12:30:37] <monostar> this is the final function code http://pastebin.com/atLpLvdk
[12:31:23] <monostar> with these 4 codes, the videos are loaded into that block but the share button is not displaying beside the first page load
[12:32:07] <Kcko> monostar  my net crash down, i see only one (http://pastebin.com/atLpLvdk)
[12:32:40] <monostar> this is the code for the video player displayed on index page - http://pastebin.com/sfspsQ6a
[12:32:49] <monostar> supporting javascript code for the share button which is included only in global header file - http://pastebin.com/H3i5gQiL
[12:32:57] <monostar> this is the code for the videos displayed on right panel which triggers the ajax call when clicked - http://pastebin.com/Zy82Qcje and get_ep_video is the function called
[12:33:05] <monostar> this is the final function code http://pastebin.com/atLpLvdk
[12:35:12] <Kcko> monostar --> hmm http://pastebin.com/H3i5gQiL this code insert to all callback ajax functions in previous codes ... its little messy but its work i think
[12:35:14] <monostar> when you hard refresh ctrl+f5 the index page, the share button is shown above the video player on right of the video heading
[12:35:43] <rue> You gotta refresh really hard, though
[12:35:53] <Kcko> monostar or use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:35:57] <FrameFever> I want to create a div: var createdDiv = myParentDiv.append("<div></div>");
[12:36:07] <FrameFever> but it seems to not return the created div
[12:36:09] <FrameFever> why?
[12:36:13] <FrameFever> what is my mistake?
[12:36:28] <Kcko> FrameFever myParentDiv is what?
[12:36:45] <FrameFever> a jquery div object
[12:37:13] <FrameFever> the handle to the div, don't know what the exact term is
[12:37:34] <SP33D> hi i have a error that i dont understand
[12:37:43] <SP33D> i wanna use a simple light box and i get TypeError: $("a.lightbox").lightBox is not a function
[12:37:53] <Kcko> and what result you expect ?
[12:37:57] <SP33D> but what is the error with that
[12:38:08] <FrameFever> the new created div
[12:38:23] <wunderCatze> @FrameFever put some dummy content in that div for testing, like <div><p>hello!</p></div> to see results
[12:38:28] <Kcko> <SP33D> not function , link to header in tag <script>  use firebug to debug it
[12:38:45] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: why? you're dealing with myParentDiv, nothing newly created
[12:38:52] <SP33D> that is the error that firebug produces
[12:38:54] <SP33D> ^^
[12:39:17] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: if you want the new div, either create it beforehand, or use $('<div>').appendTo(myParentDiv)
[12:39:25] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: ok, what it the correct way for my problem to do it?
[12:39:27] <NoiseEee> ^^ that will return your new div
[12:39:34] <SP33D> it tells me that it is not a function but there is no type error
[12:40:07] <SP33D> all JS got loaded probally using jquery 1.8.2
[12:40:18] <wachpwnski> How do you save contenteditable changes in html5??
[12:41:22] <SP33D> wachpwnski: no where
[12:41:27] <SP33D> that is not possible
[12:41:52] <SP33D> html 5 has no server access and even no client access
[12:42:12] <wunderCatze> @wachpwnski: https://www.google.ro/search?q=How+do+you+save+contenteditable+changes+in+html5&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[12:42:16] <wunderCatze> 3th link
[12:43:02] <SP33D> wunderCatze that is javascript ^^ method ^^
[12:43:41] <wachpwnski> Gets the point across speed. :D If you have anything else, I would be thankful.
[12:44:18] <SP33D> there is only php
[12:44:27] <monostar> can we get/call js code directly rather than calling from url
[12:44:40] <wunderCatze> Then I guess you could use PHP
[12:45:12] <TelFiRE> I don't understand why everyone wants so badly to use $ instead of jQuery when it so frequently causes conflicts and issues lol
[12:45:34] <wachpwnski> Becuase we are all about the $
[12:45:43] <wachpwnski> Greedy americans!
[12:45:46] <Kcko> TelFiRE  because we use only one JS library omg
[12:45:48] <SP33D> wach: gimme a tip why TypeError: $("a.lightbox").lightBox is not a function
[12:45:50] <SP33D> :D
[12:45:55] <SP33D> do i get this ?
[12:46:09] <Kcko> SP33D  show code or page
[12:46:45] <Kcko> There are many possible reasons
[12:46:50] <SP33D> http://dspeed.de/
[12:46:59] <SP33D> look around i hope you can find it
[12:47:01] <wachpwnski> shouldn't it also be something more like $('a.lightbox').lightbox()
[12:47:02] <brass> Kcko, kck?
[12:47:16] <Kcko> brass what? what is kck?
[12:47:19] <brass> nm
[12:47:20] <SP33D> hmm i can try maybe the quotes matter
[12:47:31] <TelFiRE> Kcko: sure, everyone uses only one js library. nobody ever comes in here wondering why their $ won't work when they have two.
[12:48:30] <SP33D> the code is single quoted $('a.lightbox').lightBox();
[12:48:34] <Kcko> If someone uses 2 or more libraries and knows global space and no conflict so it's  NOOB :P
[12:48:38] <SP33D> but the firebug shows it double quoted
[12:49:04] <wachpwnski> did you include your lightbox library?
[12:49:18] <SP33D> sure its included
[12:49:30] <SP33D> and there is no other labary
[12:49:30] <wachpwnski> SP33D:  you are also selecting an element and then trying to call a function from it?
[12:50:05] <SP33D> looks like
[12:50:13] <SP33D> how else should i initale it
[12:50:14] <pifantastic> SP33D: you are including jQuery twice
[12:50:18] <SP33D> its like in the example
[12:50:22] <pifantastic> the second time you include it, it overwrites lightbox
[12:50:29] <SP33D> oh wait
[12:50:42] <SP33D> right that
[12:50:56] <Kcko> lol
[12:50:56] <FrameFever> can I calculate the width of a div?
[12:51:09] <pifantastic> SP33D: they are two different version of jQuery too
[12:51:17] <Kcko> FrameFever  $("div").method();  // width, outerWidth, innerWidth
[12:51:17] <TelFiRE> var divWidth = jQuery('div').width();
[12:51:51] <SP33D> i forgot
[12:51:57] <SP33D> that i puted java at the end of the page
[12:52:04] <SP33D> coz i new learnd that this is faster
[12:52:04] <SP33D> :D
[12:52:11] <SP33D> sorry guys thx for help
[12:52:11] <TelFiRE> java â  javascript
[12:52:13] <SP33D> i was blind
[12:52:14] <monostar> is there anyway to get code directly using getscript?
[12:53:42] <monostar> if i call .js file with getscript(), the button is not showing. it needs direct javascript code run after the ajax load
[12:54:17] <FrameFever> Kcko: I need this width, without padding,border and margin
[12:54:38] <Kcko> FrameFever so use only width();
[12:54:53] <FrameFever> that does not return the desired value
[12:55:01] <FrameFever> outherWidth seems to work
[12:55:17] <Kcko> outerWidth including  all
[12:55:29] <Kcko> outer = ...
[12:55:55] <FrameFever> ahh width, seems to work too
[12:55:57] <FrameFever> my fault
[12:56:02] <FrameFever> strange
[12:56:44] <ericwx001> hola
[12:56:50] <brass> hola
[12:56:55] <ericwx001> I'm having trouble with a jquery scroll bar
[12:57:02] <ericwx001> http://evolvstudios.com/dev/castlegatecapital/index.php/about-us/14-terms2
[12:57:25] <ericwx001> you can see that the ugly scroll bar on here should be replaced by the scroll bar on the "News" page
[12:57:30] <wunderCatze> speed why did you put javascript on the end of the page?
[12:58:00] <brass> not a bad place to place javascript
[12:58:52] <ericwx001> the div ID "evolvstudios" appears to have the appropriately assigned class, just like the div id "mainbottom2" on the news page, but it doesn't work.
[13:00:00] <ericwx001> or my mistake, the div id that it does work on is "mainbodywrap"
[13:00:10] <ericwx001> or
[13:00:12] <ericwx001> "mainbottomwrap"
[13:00:14] <ericwx001> haha
[13:00:40] <wunderCatze> should javascript should be placed in a file and then called in header? Isn't this the best practice?
[13:00:57] <wunderCatze> In specially when working with a lot of line of code?
[13:01:13] <brass> wunderCatze, in a external file yes, in the header. Not necessarily
[13:02:22] <wunderCatze> if working with a few lines of code, then the best practice is to include script internaly and place it at the end of the <body>?
[13:02:52] <brass> It depends on your style, however i would put that in the <header/>
[13:03:34] <wunderCatze> so when do you put script at the end of the body?
[13:04:35] <ericwx001> when working with cloud based systems. ;)
[13:04:54] <Hapzz> so i have a .getJSON(), but i want the script it queries to return an empty json object
[13:05:00] <Hapzz> what do i want it to return? "[]" ?
[13:05:18] <brass> Hapzz, depends what the endpoint server language is but yes.
[13:05:19] <shoky> {}
[13:05:37] <Hapzz> brass php, but it shouldn't matter.
[13:05:40] <Hapzz> shoky thanks.
[13:05:42] <brass> {[]}
[13:05:52] <shoky> that's not json
[13:06:55] <brass> worked for me?
[13:07:09] <ericwx001> anyone able to assist with my question? i'm using jquery to customize the scroll bars for scrolling div id's
[13:07:13] <brass> inner object inside the json objet
[13:07:34] <shoky> objects only have key:value paris
[13:07:36] <shoky> pairs
[13:07:44] <shoky> an array [] is not a key:value pair
[13:07:47] <ericwx001> it works fine for div id "mainbottomwrap" but doesn't work at all for div id "evolvstudios", although it's setting the appropriate class on both div's
[13:07:53] <ericwx001> so the issue is actually going to be css/html related
[13:08:14] <brass> {"key": [ "subkey": "value" ] }
[13:08:25] <shoky> no
[13:08:33] <shoky> {"key": { "subkey": "value" } }
[13:08:46] <brass> http://www.json.org/js.html
[13:08:57] <shoky> what about it?
[13:09:07] <shoky> arrays don't have key:value pairs
[13:09:28] <frantz> Can someone please help me with my slider?
[13:09:53] <frantz> http://d.perich.com/ternes/12714/ the content window is somehow defined in my js, and its not extending the full height of the page
[13:09:57] <brass> sorry i meant, {"key": [ {"subkey": "value"} ] }
[13:09:59] <brass> but your right
[13:10:00] <frantz> the white gradient portion
[13:11:13] <frantz> it has to do with the height of my #horizontalContent
[13:11:16] <frantz> in my js file
[13:11:17] <frantz> http://d.perich.com/ternes/12714/themes/ternes/js/all-pages.js
[13:19:51] <ericwx001> anyone?
[13:20:16] <Kcko> everyone
[13:20:44] <ericwx001> damn
[13:21:25] <Kcko> why?
[13:22:01] <fALSO> Hi, can anyone tell me how can i match all the items that the ID starts with "box"
[13:22:11] <fALSO> im trying $('#box*')
[13:22:14] <fALSO> but that isnt working
[13:22:32] <NoiseEee> http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/ @ fALSO
[13:23:03] <Kcko> fALSO: $(*[id^='box'])
[13:23:11] <ericwx001> Kcko: not sure how to fix this and i'm falling asleep at my desk. lol
[13:23:27] <ericwx001> so.. damn seems like the appropriate word
[13:23:32] <Kcko> ericwx001  what u need to fix?
[13:23:41] <ericwx001> jquery scroll bar
[13:24:01] <Kcko> oh
[13:24:01] <aghouseh> can anyone lend some advice on splitting a long ul/li into multiple columns (without css-columns) but retaining semantic markup?
[13:24:06] <Kcko> use native :)
[13:24:19] <ericwx001> native?
[13:24:48] <eTiger13>  has anyone ever visited http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated  ?
[13:25:08] <eTiger13> deciding if it should stay in, who uses it and why
[13:36:26] <TelFiRE> Hello,
[13:36:37] <xckpd7> question: if you have a template inside of a script tag, how would you put a script tag into the script tag?
[13:36:54] <ericwx001> you don't need to start another script tag
[13:37:24] <TelFiRE> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jLGeb -- This for whatever reason is not working like it does live, on load, but once you hit "next" it works as expected (albeit a bit weirdly styled). My question is could this jquery code be optimized much?
[13:37:40] <xckpd7> ericwx001: yeah I do... I need a template which builds some widget code for me
[13:37:50] <ericwx001> ah gotcha
[13:37:51] <xckpd7> ericwx001: and the widget code for obvious reason needs a script tag
[13:37:59] <ericwx001> cheat and include it in a js file
[13:38:30] <ericwx001> don't really take my advice, i'm here for support also. lol
[13:38:44] <ericwx001> i just aimlessly try things until i find something that works. :)
[13:38:46] <xckpd7> ericwx001: no that's ok
[13:38:57] <xckpd7> ericwx001: I guess I could do that.... if that's the only way
[13:39:26] <ericwx001> could place it at the end of your template
[13:39:35] <ericwx001> so when your template script closes, open another script tag again
[13:40:38] <ericwx001> but if you're targeting ID's or classes that are set by jquery/js then you'll want to make sure your new script loads after the template script also
[13:41:07] <ericwx001> which effectively a js file would do that, but i think placing it at the bottom of the template should do that as well
[13:45:38] <ericwx001> anyone feel like assisting with my issue? lol
[13:46:14] <ericwx001> my jquery scrollbar doesn't function with one of my div id's and i can't figure out why
[13:47:08] <FrameFever> when I search for an item in jquery, how can I check it was found?
[13:47:30] <shoky> FrameFever: check the .length
[13:48:06] <FrameFever> okay an what about check against "undefined"?
[13:48:21] <shoky> what do you mean
[13:48:46] <shoky> if the selection doesn't find an element, you'll still get a jquery object back
[13:48:48] <shoky> not undefined
[13:49:23] <fALSO> Im trying to do this:
[13:49:23] <fALSO> $(this).before('<a href="'+match[1]+'">');
[13:49:23] <fALSO> $(this).after('</a>');
[13:49:39] <fALSO> but the before instruction is closing the A tag :(
[13:49:39] <shoky> uhh you can't do it like that
[13:50:11] <shoky> do $(this).wrap('<a href="'+match[1]+'">')
[13:50:27] <shoky> you can't add "part" of a tag to the DOM
[13:50:40] <fALSO> ahh wrap. i didnt knew that one :)
[13:50:45] <fALSO> thank you shoky going to try it out
[13:51:30] <FrameFever> shoky: ok
[13:56:30] <starsinmypockets> Anyone mind loking at this? The first click does as expected, and changes the class. The second click, however, doesn't call the second function - it calls the first function again :/  http://dpaste.org/ivZwU/
[14:02:01] <starsinmypockets> If I use live('click', function () {...}) this code works, except that I get a conflict / error on some pages object has no method live...
[14:02:08] <starsinmypockets> Both problems are irksome ;)
[14:12:18] <gabrieluk> hi, i was wondering. if someone is working in a "responsive" website, where it is supposed to work across all devices; which considerations should be taken regarding jquery and jquery mobile? I mean if it should be cross device compatible should i be working with both?
[14:13:25] <pifantastic> gabrieluk: jQuery mobile is more geared toward making mobile specific sites
[14:13:48] <pifantastic> gabrieluk: if you want to work across all devices, I would stick with jQuery (if needed) and a solid responsive design
[14:14:03] <pifantastic> however you don't need jQuery to build a responsive website
[14:14:25] <TelFiRE> jQuery mobile is just weird
[14:14:36] <gabrieluk> mm, ok. I'm doing solid responsive with css already, media @, etc,em,%
[14:15:08] <TelFiRE> what are you looking to accomplish that involves jquery
[14:15:38] <ericwx001> any help?????
[14:15:39] <gabrieluk> nothing special. i use already jquery plugins, such as fittext.js and lettering.jd
[14:15:53] <pifantastic> ?ask @ ericwx001
[14:15:53] <bot-t> ericwx001, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:16:08] <ericwx001> pifantastic: i've asked it like 4 or 5 times already
[14:16:11] <ericwx001> here and in ##programming
[14:16:12] <TelFiRE> well I doubt you need jquery mobile
[14:16:26] <gabrieluk> TelFiRE i would like also to write some custom jquery
[14:16:33] <ericwx001> i've got a jquery scrollbar that should be on 2 div id's (overflow hidden) but it's only working for 1 id
[14:16:39] <pifantastic> ericwx001: if you recreate the problem using jsfiddle it's a lot easier for us to help
[14:16:48] <gabrieluk> nothing fancy, just a slide or some small animation
[14:17:37] <TelFiRE> jquery mobile is basically pre-created functions and stuff that are popular on mobile. If you're doing something custom I don't think it's needed. It's good if you need to get a mobile site and you don't care about look and just want a decent one out of the box, and standard iphone like functions. But most custom websites should just use good ol jquery
[14:17:46] <ericwx001> pifantastic: that's a little difficult because it's a joomla system..
[14:18:00] <fALSO> thanks for all your help! i managed to create my first "userscript" for the browser
[14:18:01] <fALSO> :)
[14:18:12] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: Do you have two elements with the same id?
[14:18:23] <ericwx001> nope
[14:18:46] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: Oh, than can't help much more without some codde.
[14:18:49] <ericwx001> it's a new id (#evolvstudios) on this page: http://www.evolvstudios.com/dev/castlegatecapital/index.php/news
[14:18:50] <BillCriswell> then*
[14:19:01] <gabrieluk> TelFiRE, ok, good to know. I do want  standard iphone like functions, but i don't mind to implement manually, actually, i give preference
[14:19:34] <TelFiRE> While posting an example is frequently a little tough, especially with CMSs involved when you don't want to share a direct link, it is actually impossible for anyone to help in most cases. We can't see what's wrong, we can't even investigate the problem, how are we supposed to solve it from a vague explanation
[14:20:04] <TelFiRE> disreguard since you shared the actual link lol
[14:20:41] <gabrieluk> ops, lol
[14:22:15] <gabrieluk> TelFiRE, I'm glad I don't need to learn 1 more thing, pff
[14:22:17] <ericwx001> id #evolvstudios is located in my article template php file
[14:22:25] <ericwx001> while all of my js files are included into the index.php files
[14:22:56] <TelFiRE> I'm somewhat unimpressed with jQuery UI and mobile, they seem to me inflexible. Could just be my lack of experience with them, but I've been steering clear.
[14:23:40] <gabrieluk> jquery should be good to give me a good time already. TelFiRE, would be able to point me some links with some good challenges so i can get productive writing custom jquery? I know vanilla js quite well
[14:24:24] <ericwx001> is anyone looking at my problem? lol
[14:25:11] <ericwx001> do i need to include my js files in the article template default.php file?
[14:25:17] <TelFiRE> gabrieluk: hard for me to know where you're at with it.  But this is a really good ground-up and goes on to some fairly advanced things. Well some would scoff at that but it's enough to do some pretty good things, and it talks about best practices, using the right selectors to avoid performance problems, etc. Someone shared it here earlier and I'm just going through now. https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[14:25:44] <starsinmypockets> Any idea why I'd get this on one page load and not another?
[14:25:45] <starsinmypockets> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'live'
[14:25:53] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: It's looking like it's applying the plugin but the CSS isn't working on it?
[14:26:53] <ericwx001> BillCriswell: that's correct. it applies the correct class to that ID but just doesn't have any effect. that's why i was curious if i need to include my JS files on the article template page.. but that doesn't seem like the answer to me.
[14:27:14] <gabrieluk> fantastic, i like a lot video casts
[14:28:48] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: Try validating your HTML real quick.. could be something off with that. It seems like there are unclosed elements in there that could be having a weird effect?
[14:29:03] <gabrieluk> It's funny my position, although i have the very basics of jquery on me already, such chains, what the api does, etc. I know js since january and i know flash animation for about 8 years, so the properties of jquery are very familiar to me, or should i call them methods
[14:29:14] <ericwx001> BillCriswell: I'll do that.
[14:32:04] <gabrieluk> TelFiRE. do you have experience developing for  bile?ffdfdf
[14:32:11] <gabrieluk> mobile?*
[14:32:48] <TelFiRE> I do responsive sites that work everywhere
[14:35:04] <gabrieluk> amazing, i have a question regarding a slideshow i want to do. not sure if with jquery or css3. I will prepare a question, and after i send a link. doesn't even need to be today. it is a bit complex idea, involving svg, tinny svg, etc, i need to visualily prepare some stuff also
[14:36:05] <ericwx001> BillCriswell: killed the unclosed tag but still nothing
[14:36:31] <gabrieluk> in a nutshell, i want a fixed full width backgroud that cycles svg, and it works in mobiles with tiny svg
[14:36:44] <gabrieluk> background slideshow*
[14:36:53] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: Is there like a minimum width it needs before it kicks on or something?
[14:37:03] <BillCriswell> minimum overflow height* I guess I mean?
[14:38:20] <ericwx001> I don't believe so, i'm willing to try tho
[14:39:49] <ericwx001> no go, Bill
[14:40:29] <afflicto> Hey all. I'm loading stuff via AJAX that returns JSON. I do $.parseJSON(result) But sometimes I get "Unexpected Identifier" How can I better handle these errors? I mean, as far as I know. It should work fine. I have no idea where the problem is (on the php side that is). It's very difficult to manually read the resulting json cause it's huge. Thanks in advance.
[14:45:11] <ericwx001> any other suggestions BillCriswell ?
[14:45:48] <Kcko> afflicto>
[14:46:03] <Kcko> use Try {} catch on PHP side and catch json_last_error ...
[14:46:07] <Kcko> more in php manual
[14:46:35] <Kcko> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-last-error.php
[14:46:48] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: Not without taking a real hard look at it
[14:47:45] <BillCriswell> ericwx001: I'd just go back to the plugins page and see what I could have done wrong.
[14:48:28] <BillCriswell> Got to run though
[14:50:40] <afflicto> Kcko: Thanks but I found out how how to handle errors. I thought I had malformed JSON, but it was malformed javascript on the page I was loading. I had forgotten that. Well, now I know :P
[14:51:07] <Kcko> afflicto ur welcome
[14:54:32] <kroniksenvy> Im looking for a plugin that will allow me to create a slidable content on the bottom of my page say its hidden when page loads but when you press on the button content slides up like so http://i50.tinypic.com/8vvggn.jpg
[14:54:58] <kroniksenvy> Iv been looking on googled for slidable content plugins but all i found were gallery plugins
[14:57:52] <ericwx001> plugins page???
[14:57:59] <ericwx001> lol
[14:58:10] <Kcko> LOL
[14:58:10] <Kcko> ;)
[14:58:18] <Kcko> 2 divs and one ANIMATE function
[14:58:23] <Kcko> no need plugin

[14:59:32] <black_warlock> guys
[15:00:08] <black_warlock> how would work applying sortable ui and save positions with dynamic code ?
[15:00:25] <Kcko> black_warlock same like non-dynamic code :D
[15:00:37] <black_warlock> hum
[15:00:50] <ericwx001> the only thing i can think of doing is including my js files in the template layout for the article page
[15:00:57] <black_warlock> but to save positions i use database
[15:01:21] <black_warlock> i mean each item has an order field
[15:01:24] <ericwx001> but with them already being included in the main index.php file it doesn't make much sense to me to include them in any other file
[15:02:17] <Kcko> black_warlock and where is the problem?
[15:02:47] <black_warlock> the problem is i dont understand how sortable works
[15:03:09] <Kcko> sortable sent some string in GET URL
[15:03:27] <Kcko> something like this list[0]=value&list[1]=value2
[15:03:35] <Kcko> u must read docs
[15:04:53] <black_warlock> is there a way to print what the hell sortable is doing and whats the string sent ?
[15:05:11] <black_warlock> im in this page
[15:05:17] <black_warlock> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[15:05:52] <black_warlock> if i want to response in a <div id="strings"
[15:06:08] <black_warlock> the serialization
[15:06:12] <nveid> Can I cancel a jquery-ui selecting from the selecting event?
[15:06:25] <nveid> evt.stopPropagation() doesn't work.. so wondering if there's another way to do it
[15:06:27] <Kcko> http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/
[15:06:31] <Kcko> better plugin than UI
[15:06:56] <Kcko> look to output methods under tree
[15:07:21] <black_warlock> ahhhh
[15:07:28] <black_warlock> thats what im looking for
[15:07:59] <black_warlock> because in this way i can send the serialization for oprations in async page
[15:09:35] <black_warlock> hum
[15:09:39] <black_warlock> max levels ?
[15:09:52] <nveid> hmâ¦ don't like how there's no way to stop jquery-ui selecting
[15:10:06] <nveid> without cheating and binding to mousedown.. which disables deselecting
[15:10:35] <black_warlock> $( "#sortable" ).disableSelection();
[15:11:04] <black_warlock> that must be
[15:11:09] <black_warlock> nveid
[15:13:40] <Kcko> sleep?
[15:13:59] <Kcko> $("#Kcko").sleep("fast");
[15:15:05] <nveid> Kcko: huh?
[15:15:38] <Kcko> myself function to sleep my object (me)   :)
[15:15:59] <Kcko> myself = my
[15:16:05] <Kcko> shit
[15:23:54] <nveid> stupid jquery ui
[15:26:08] <TelFiRE> that's my prob with it
[15:26:09] <TelFiRE> inflexible
[15:40:43] <abrkn> i think im confused with canvas... http://jsfiddle.net/abrkn/99cEy/
[15:40:48] <abrkn> why doesnt that make a border?
[15:43:39] <BinaryKitten> abrkn no clue, doesn't look much like jquery code either
[15:43:52] <abrkn> some of it is jq.. :-|
[15:44:36] <BinaryKitten> yes abrkn but the problem isn't with jquery code
[15:44:58] <Kcko> :D
[15:46:01] <abrkn> :-(
[15:48:45] <Kcko> abrkn -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8027601/html5-canvas-draw-rect-got-border-of-diff-width
[15:59:03] <BinaryKitten> abrkn: http://jsfiddle.net/99cEy/4/
[16:00:46] <mausolos> is this the right place for jquery support?
[16:00:59] <jcbk> If I've got a function within a function, how do I use $(this) which is passed to the outer function?
[16:01:09] <BinaryKitten> mausolos possibly
[16:01:24] <BinaryKitten> jcbk by aliasing
[16:01:42] <BinaryKitten> eg var $this = $(this);  in outer function
[16:01:53] <BinaryKitten> then you can use $this in the inner function
[16:04:19] <mausolos> okay :) so, i have a modal form that's loading when you click on a link.  it uses ajax to bring the form into the modal window.  when the form loads, a function is called to initialize a jScrollPane instance on a target div.  however, when the form is submitted via ajax for validation and comes back with errors, the jScrollPane init function loses focus and doesn't reinitialize
[16:05:35] <mausolos> when i try to and add an on submit or on click bind to the form/submission button, it can't find it; it can only find the modal window.
[16:06:22] <mausolos> any ideas what i can do to get jScrollPane to show up reliably?

[16:46:15] <sunbeam> while skipping h3?
[16:53:25] <eph3meral> sunbeam: I don't think there are really any hard and fast rules about that
[16:53:52] <eph3meral> sunbeam: google changes its algorithms all the time to punish various people who do dumb stuff - at times it was better to always use h1, then they changed that
[16:54:12] <eph3meral> sunbeam: I'd say "go in order" for the most part, and change the styles to make it look right for your app

[17:20:15] <black_warlock> i can sort items in a menu without serializing anything
[17:20:18] <dblosevn> i have a feeling its not jquery scrwing them up :-D
[17:20:44] <docmur> lol well what else could turn a button from single click to double click
[17:21:08] <dblosevn> docmur: your implementation
[17:21:52] <starsinmypockets> Having a wierd problem: if you visit maverickjetpants.com and click the close or open tab on the flyout menu, it works fine - then if you select one of the items from the left-hand menu, when it reloads the tabs no longer work :/
[17:22:12] <starsinmypockets> http://maverickjetpants.com and http://maverickjetpants.com/map-view/5
[17:22:25] <docmur> Unless I call a method that swaps the clickable trigger from single to double it shouldn't ever switch.  This is the code I'm working with. http://andrewreg.dev1.naccvp.com/index.php  there is a test admin account fake@fake.com and just use password.  When you click action the table of button drops and first time you click a button in the last it's single click and from then con you need to double click.
[17:28:43] <brass> docmur, you know you have code in place where the email account has to be verified. You should manually set fake@fake.com's record to be authenticated.
[17:29:34] <docmur> yes but that is a fake email anyway and I have access to the sql database so I can reset it if I want to so thats not a concern
[17:30:34] <brass> docmur, i mean i tried logging in and it gave an alert() stating "check email to verify account"
[17:31:10] <docmur> fake@fake.com and password?
[17:31:13] <docmur> I just logged in using it
[17:32:09] <brass> i tried it about an hour ago, did you change it since then?
[17:32:24] <docmur> oh ya, I've changed it.
[17:32:34] <docmur> if it looks you out just tell me I'll swap the activation
[17:38:33] <black_warlock> whos on ?
[17:39:01] <tw2113> 800 people

[17:43:53] <goddard> how is jquery accordion nesting ?
[17:44:03] <goddard> is it easy? im having a hard time finding an example
[17:46:03] <docmur> do you see what I'm talking about?
[18:03:26] <starsinmypockets> Anyone mind to look at this error in flyout.js - http://www.maverickjetpants.com/map-view/18
[18:06:21] <azbyin> hi all..
[18:07:01] <azbyin> is jqueryui 1.8.x still available as a customisable download?
[18:07:23] <azbyin> the themer on the jqueryui page only gives 1.9
[18:25:22] <pifantastic> starsinmypockets: the version of jquery you are using doesn't not support .live()
[18:25:32] <pifantastic> 1.2.6 is ooooooold, you need at least 1.3.2
[18:25:43] <starsinmypockets> pifantastic - that makes perfect sense - thanks
[18:26:01] <docmur> could adding a class to a parent div kill a trigger?
[18:26:06] <starsinmypockets> They way drupal loads jquery is a pain - it is loading 1.3.2 on some pages, but not others
[18:26:10] <docmur> such as a click on a child button
[18:26:42] <pifantastic> docmur: it should not, but removing a class can
[18:26:54] <pifantastic> starsinmypockets: are you using the jQuery update module?
[18:27:42] <docmur> ..... wait so if I do $('parentDIV').removeClass.addClass() that might kill child buttons
[18:27:48] <starsinmypockets> pifantastic - no, I should install that - it's odd because there are mlutiple jquery files being loaded per page load, of diferent versions
[18:28:20] <docmur> I'm thinking tghat could explain why my buttons need a double click after the first time
[18:28:25] <rgenito> mannnn
[18:28:43] <rgenito> damn wordpress messin wit mah jabascript >[
[18:28:56] <pifantastic> docmur: if you are binding events using on(), and you change the selector of the element they are bound to, yes, that could be a problem
[18:29:12] <pifantastic> starsinmypockets: maybe your theme is being dumb
[18:29:17] <pifantastic> and loading jQuery on its own
[18:30:33] <starsinmypockets> pifantastic... yeah, a theme or module - not sure.. I'll try the update module though, and dig deeper... drupal 7 has a a js_alter hook which seems handy
[18:32:41] <docmur> Pitfantastic this is my seciton of code: http://pastebin.com/xHYsHnP1,  I append a div full of buttons at line 16 and then after the click on those buttons post on line 30, then line 33 I had removeClass().addClass() to effectly swap the color of the parentDiv.  The first time you do this the buttons needs 1 click, after that they need 2
[18:35:44] <black_warlock> how to make 1 item unsorteble in jq-ui sortable
[18:36:01] <black_warlock> hell the fooking bug still persist in the version 2.0
[18:37:00] <black_warlock> if i have an <ul> with sortable <li> inside and the <ul> stands empty im not able to put items inside that ul
[18:37:13] <black_warlock> wtf
[18:37:57] <black_warlock> i have added an empty li at the end of <li> list
[18:38:07] <black_warlock> but still moveble
[18:38:12] <black_warlock> =(
[18:41:49] <black_warlock> fuk
[18:41:55] <black_warlock> its bugged
[18:45:37] <phonebook_> sry if this is off topic. i did learn this from mr resig though
[18:45:40] <batmanbond3d> black_warlock: Can I see your items selector for your sortable
[18:46:07] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/58/
[18:46:13] <phonebook_> look at the footer here http://qunitjs.com/ im trying to do the same thing http://jsfiddle.net/xMwT8/4/ but i cant get it working without using a gradient
[18:46:20] <black_warlock> i m trying to add an empty li to the end of list
[18:46:40] <black_warlock> and to make it unsortable
[18:46:49] <batmanbond3d> ok let me give it a shot
[18:46:51] <phonebook_> $("#myUL").append("<li>hello world</li>");
[18:46:54] <black_warlock> so in all <ul> there will be always one element
[18:48:00] <phonebook_> not personally, i mean he probably thinks im an asshole
[18:48:15] <phonebook_> but the first time i ever noticed this technique in css was on that site
[18:48:33] <batmanbond3d> black_warlock: check out items inside the sortable doc
[18:49:05] <batmanbond3d> black_warlock: You can specify which items you want to be sortable, I don't see you doing that here
[18:50:21] <azbyin> can someone tell me why the accordion does not fill the available space? http://jsbin.com/ejaxen/1
[18:51:12] <batmanbond3d> black_warlock, maybe you want something like this $( "#sortable" ).sortable({ items : ' > li:not(:last-child)'});
[18:51:52] <black_warlock> hell that code is not working properly
[18:52:03] <black_warlock> but yes something like that
[18:52:29] <black_warlock> im setting the last <li id="unsortable">
[18:53:15] <batmanbond3d> I'm not sure if that works, I use the items attribute personally when I want certain rows to be not sortable
[18:53:20] <black_warlock> but dont get why in that script is not sorting all <li>s
[18:53:31] <black_warlock> but
[18:53:33] <black_warlock> man
[18:53:45] <black_warlock> if you put some sortable item in the last spot ?
[18:53:53] <black_warlock> you will not be able to move it
[18:54:17] <black_warlock> i dont care where the unsortable item is
[18:54:32] <black_warlock> there must be just one in any ul
[18:54:52] <black_warlock> ul must never stand out of <li> or the script will break down
[18:55:05] <black_warlock> mega bug i found !
[18:55:19] <batmanbond3d> so you have uls within uls?
[18:55:23] <phonebook_> it will break down like evidence in a vat of acid
[18:55:36] <phonebook_> help - http://jsfiddle.net/xMwT8/5/
[18:56:04] <batmanbond3d> you need to set your items query not to peek into the inner ULs
[18:56:13] <batmanbond3d> or yes, wierd things are going to happen
[18:56:30] <batmanbond3d> usually something like items : ' > li'
[18:56:40] <batmanbond3d> will stop it from peeking in inner uls.
[18:59:53] <phonebook_> you guys dont know anything about jquery
[19:02:16] <tw2113> knowing me, if i wanted to keep at least 1 li in the list, i'd grab all the li's and check that the length doesn't equal zero, and if it does, just add one quick

[19:13:36] <wachpwnski> anyone here use sass or less?
[19:15:03] <coldhead> yes, wachpwnski
[19:15:29] <wachpwnski> Worth the time learning?
[19:15:42] <coldhead> you tell me: http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[19:15:56] <coldhead> sass src https://github.com/coldhead/kaleidos/blob/master/css/kaleidoscope.scss
[19:16:09] <coldhead> sass output https://github.com/coldhead/kaleidos/blob/master/css/kaleidoscope.css
[19:16:17] <coldhead> 6000 lines i didn't have to write :D
[19:16:53] <coldhead> i like it
[19:16:59] <coldhead> would use again and not much to learn
[19:17:06] <wachpwnski> coldhead:  here is how I plan on using it.
[19:17:33] <black_warlock> i found it
[19:17:35] <black_warlock> yessa
[19:17:39] <wachpwnski> We are making a media player, and I think we can use it as a theming engine to generate the css for the player. Does that sound reasonable?
[19:19:08] <coldhead> sure wachpwnski
[19:19:11] <coldhead> that's similar to what i did
[19:19:33] <coldhead> generated all the slightly different CSS depending on how many segments in the kaleidoscope
[19:19:44] <coldhead> and then scope the actual CSS to use via a parent class

[19:31:14] <afflicto> Hey all. I have a $(".sortable").sortable(); with some code in the sortable.create() method. I want to run that .create() function manually after it runs. Any way to do that?
[19:35:56] <black_warlock> use .click('button')
[19:37:04] <black_warlock> sortable.create(('button').click(function())
[19:37:18] <black_warlock> or not ?
[19:57:10] <rgenito> any jquery experts out there for hire?
[19:57:58] <pifantastic> rgenito: I can help you for free

[20:12:33] <rgenito> hmmm
[20:39:22] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/TAKAPnRp
[20:39:25] <ericw> nothing wrong with that right?
[20:40:38] <tw2113> i wish i knew what was causing a div to be seemingly created out of thin air
[20:40:49] <tw2113> looks fine to me eric
[20:40:51] <tw2113> ericw,
[20:40:55] <coldhead> it won't win any beauty contests with that indentation
[20:41:20] <coldhead> also hide() will save you some bandwidth
[20:45:11] <tw2113> coldhead, for once i have a legit question
[20:45:35] <tw2113> should i be able to log all stuff that happens on a click event?
[20:46:00] <tw2113> or at least would i be able to
[20:46:21] <ericw> coldhead: yeah i've been working on multiple ways of doing this because nothing appears to be working.
[20:46:34] <ericw> the indentation is automatic for some reason in joomla. :/
[20:50:10] <coldhead> tw2113: "all stuff that happens"?
[20:50:32] <tw2113> trying to debug why clicking prev/next in a slider clones a set of thumbs
[20:50:59] <tw2113> this -> <div id="1"></div><div id="2"></div>
[20:51:08] <tw2113> turns into <div id="1"></div><div id="1"></div><div id="2"></div>
[20:51:28] <coldhead> do you want the lecture about not starting IDs with numbers?
[20:51:37] <tw2113> nope, just a quick example
[20:51:43] <coldhead> of course
[20:51:49] <coldhead> i was just buying time
[20:51:53] <coldhead> i'm not sure how i'd debug that
[20:52:02] <tw2113> darn
[20:52:11] <coldhead> maybe break on subtree modification in chrome web inspector
[20:52:20] <coldhead> that way you can find out which code is doing that
[20:52:33] <coldhead> and then maybe set an earlier breakpoint to see wtf is up
[20:52:47] <coldhead> i've never found a better way to debug errant event handlers
[20:53:31] <azbyin> theres dom mutation observers
[20:53:38] <azbyin> you can set one up i guess
[20:53:59] <coldhead> that's going to have the same effect as break on subtree modification though isn't it?
[20:54:16] <azbyin> i believe so
[20:54:55] <tw2113> http://pastebin.com/wGs0LL2A
[20:55:10] <tw2113> BUT that's in the jquery library itself
[20:56:20] <azbyin> tw2113, doesnt your chromium inspector/console show you a stack trace?
[20:56:32] <azbyin> just look up how it got there and you'll have your answer
[20:56:36] <tw2113> aha
[20:56:39] <tw2113> firebug does have that
[20:57:15] <tw2113> i'm just not used to debugging js like this
[20:59:35] <coldhead> step up
[20:59:44] <coldhead> step out
[20:59:47] <coldhead> \o/
[21:01:03] <ericw> coldhead: mind helping me figure out why i can't make a div disappear?
[21:01:09] <ericw> http://evolvstudios.com/dev/castlegatecapital/
[21:01:21] <ericw> you can see the content box is set to height 500
[21:01:26] <azbyin> ericw, $("#mydiv").hide() ?
[21:01:33] <tw2113> i think i prefer minified over packed
[21:01:34] <ericw> it doesn't work
[21:02:20] <azbyin> ericw, ok i loaded the page.. what is to be hidden away?
[21:02:43] <ericw> #main_wrap2
[21:02:52] <ericw> it's the ID that is expanding the page
[21:03:46] <azbyin> $("#main_wrap2").hide()
[21:03:55] <azbyin> that made it disappear..
[21:04:02] <azbyin> whats wrong with your browser again?
[21:05:04] <ericw> azbyin: refresh
[21:05:12] <ericw> the code is now in place however it has no effect
[21:05:27] <azbyin> err what? you're doing it in the wrong place then!
[21:05:37] <azbyin> i just typed it out in firebug console and it disappeared
[21:06:09] <ericw> firebug > script
[21:06:20] <ericw> it's placed near the header in the body
[21:08:38] <azbyin> obviously!
[21:08:47] <azbyin> like i said it is in the wrong place
[21:09:14] <azbyin> scroll down to the end and what do you see? the customscrollbar is being setup on #main_wrap2
[21:09:42] <zenmastur> hey
[21:11:00] <zenmastur> anyone around to help?
[21:12:12] <coldhead> and that is what video games and pornography have done to attention spans
[21:12:46] <tw2113> huh?
[21:12:51] <tw2113> sorry, was staring at kittens
[21:13:04] <coldhead> ah, sweet euphemism
[21:13:16] <tw2113> i really am looking at kittens, to be fair
[21:13:24] <tw2113> they're the images in this fuggin slider
[21:19:57] <tw2113> coldhead, my ending thoughts for the night on that topic
[21:20:15] <tw2113> since there is js being used to slice and add divs after the fact, i'm wondering if that's throwing off the slider
[21:20:57] <coldhead> that seems like the kind of thing that might upset a slider
[21:22:26] <rgenito> so i finally fixed that bug that i was talking about a few hours ago lol
[21:22:39] <rgenito> ...this wordpress theme was including 2 different versions of jquery... *sigh*
[21:23:01] <rgenito> (and the issue it broke... was just some minute detail. grrr!)
[21:23:14] <azbyin> lol, werent you the guy who said something about jquery 1.2.6 ?
[21:23:30] <tw2113> eww, themes providing their own jquery
