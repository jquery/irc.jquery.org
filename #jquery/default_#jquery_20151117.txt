[02:04:48] <jak2000> anyone worked with full calendar?
[02:06:17] <slax0r> why? are you doing a poll?
[03:51:47] <hellyeah> hey
[03:51:56] <hellyeah> i have js script that is almost full of jquery
[03:52:04] <hellyeah> and it works really well in i.e. 11
[03:52:14] <hellyeah> does that mean it will work in i.e. 10 nicely?
[04:06:08] <Uhkis> maybe
[04:06:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:07:09] <hellyeah> eh
[04:07:17] <hellyeah> codepen.io has an option for that i guess
[04:18:58] <tuskkk___> console logged, $(this).parent().parent(); it shows two objects for that div, how is that possible?
[04:19:15] <Cork> it isn't
[04:19:24] <Cork> unless this is more then one element
[04:21:31] <tuskkk___> wait, let me see if I can show it in fiddle.
[04:23:25] <tuskkk___> :( in fiddle it shows only one!
[04:35:20] <tuskkk___> need a little help here, on that click it should find the accordian class and toggle it, http://jsfiddle.net/nagsabye/
[04:40:33] <tuskkk___> nvm, got it.
[04:49:45] <buscon> hi all
[04:50:01] <buscon> i am writing a web app for android and ios that uses the accelerometer data
[04:50:13] <Uhkis> thanks for the info!
[04:50:18] <buscon> on android, the data stream is interrupted when the screen turns off
[04:50:39] <buscon> is there a way to get the accelerometer data, even when the screen is off?
[04:50:41] <Uhkis> this is #jquery, not #android or whatnot
[04:51:09] <buscon> Uhkis, well, the first problem is that i don't know where to ask, it is a cross themes subject...
[04:51:25] <buscon> it is android-browser-javascript related
[04:52:10] <Uhkis> well it sure isn't this channel :)
[04:52:44] <Uhkis> but sounds mostly like an android question
[05:06:36] <reca-cabanz> Hey guys I need your help. Im newbie of this. I'm trying to link my jquery from my js tab. My website is run by wordpress so that's why the files are seperated sengrated. I'm not sure if Im doing it correctly.
[05:30:38] <bambanx> guys how i can use preloader like this? http://materializecss.com/preloader.html
[05:34:09] <Audlex> the website tells you how?
[05:34:09] <vdeep> bambanx just include the css and use the given code
[05:34:17] <bambanx> i did
[05:34:40] <vdeep> seems pretty simple
[05:34:41] <vdeep> http://jsfiddle.net/nynuy6r5/
[05:35:07] <bambanx> yeah but
[05:35:14] <bambanx> how put a image inside
[05:35:16] <bambanx> http://pastebin.com/hbKVniFz
[05:35:24] <bambanx> how i preload a image
[05:35:31] <bambanx> using jquery?
[05:35:43] <bambanx> and hidden the div or something?
[05:36:03] <vdeep> you can't directly put an image in there
[05:36:22] <vdeep> you'll have to put the image separately, then hide/show the preloader using javascript/jquery
[05:36:32] <vdeep> when the image is loaded, hide the preloader
[05:36:49] <bambanx> damn
[05:36:51] <bambanx> :D
[05:36:53] <vdeep> and to check if the image has been loaded, you can use jquery
[05:38:20] <bambanx> is a grid with lot of images
[05:38:27] <bambanx> not very sure how i can do that
[05:39:10] <bambanx> its is my code http://pastebin.com/DndbGNty
[05:39:15] <bambanx> html
[05:42:44] <bambanx> ca you help me? vdeep
[05:43:03] <vdeep> let me send you an example
[05:43:23] <bambanx> cool :D
[05:47:21] <xenaxon> hi. Is there any way I can syncronize/download files from a webserver and show progress onpage?
[05:48:42] <Cork> xenaxon: kinda, but not really
[05:48:57] <Cork> xenaxon: what you can do is pull the file as a blob
[05:49:11] <Cork> then create a link for that blob and let the user save the brob content
[05:49:25] <xenaxon> Cork: I want to do this on a php server
[05:49:29] <xenaxon> I am running this in a php server
[05:49:33] <xenaxon> so I can use ajax
[05:49:45] <xenaxon> but how can I best do this on the jquery part
[05:49:47] <Cork> the best option is to just use the browsers built in download manager
[05:49:49] <xenaxon> for showing progress
[05:50:21] <xenaxon> I can use php to make a script an download the files in a folder on the local server
[05:50:28] <xenaxon> but I want to show progress in html/jquery
[05:50:37] <Cork> uh
[05:50:41] <xenaxon> this is my problem, don't know how to show progress in real time
[05:50:44] <Cork> are you talking about upload?
[05:50:50] <xenaxon> not upload, download
[05:50:53] <xenaxon> there are 2 server
[05:50:58] <xenaxon> 1 is remote
[05:51:00] <xenaxon> 1 is local
[05:51:08] <Cork> and how is this js related?
[05:51:15] <xenaxon> I already said that
[05:51:19] <xenaxon> but I want to show progress in html/jquery
[05:51:38] <xenaxon> "but I want to show progress in html/jquery"
[05:51:39] <xenaxon> "this is my problem, don't know how to show progress in real time"
[05:51:47] <Cork> so you want one server to pull data from a second sever and on something like an administrator interface show how far it has gotten?
[05:51:57] <xenaxon> exactly!
[05:52:05] <Cork> => ##php
[05:52:12] <Cork> the problem will be getting the data
[05:52:20] <xenaxon> I can get the data
[05:52:23] <xenaxon> by php
[05:52:28] <xenaxon> but how do I display progress
[05:52:30] <xenaxon> in jquery
[05:52:40] <Cork> ok then just use something like a <progress> interface
[05:52:55] <Cork> set how far youve gotten and reload the page every x seconds
[05:53:07] <Cork> or you can pull this data and update it through js
[05:53:15] <Cork> (basically the same thing)
[05:53:38] <Cork> but you need to know the size of the file and how much you've downloaded
[06:13:37] <realnot> what is the best way to extract the values of the properties from an Array of Objects?
[06:14:11] <Cork> realnot: a specific value from each array position or what?
[06:14:36] <realnot> Array [ Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 355 more… ] each Object has an attrbute "date" and "price"
[06:14:49] <Cork> and you want them in what format?
[06:15:13] <realnot> labels = [ all date here... ]
[06:15:28] <realnot> price = [ all prices here... ]
[06:16:03] <Cork> well there are two options either loop the array with each and set labels.push() and price.push()
[06:16:30] <Cork> or var labels = $.map(arr, function(obj) { return obj.date });
[06:16:43] <Cork> and var prices = $.map(arr, function(obj) { return obj.price });
[06:17:19] <realnot> Cork: the data are extracted in order?
[06:17:34] <Cork> what?
[06:17:39] <realnot> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6565281/iterating-over-array-of-objects-javascript-odd-behaviour
[06:17:48] <realnot> If you use for in to loop over property names in an object, the results are not ordered
[06:18:08] <Cork> that isn't a loop over objects though
[06:18:12] <realnot> or this is not my case
[06:18:47] <Cork> it is a loop over an array
[06:18:52] <Cork> where the value is an object
[06:24:18] <realnot> Cork: have you never used Chart.js?
[06:24:25] <realnot> http://www.chartjs.org
[06:26:49] <realnot> Cork: btw, it works, thanks :)
[06:27:34] <Cork> realnot: haven't used that specific one no
[06:55:16] <dudeJi> hey guys : is there is any way of get the selectors of onClick function in jquery : like :  $('#a,#b').on('click','.abc',function(){}); if .abc was inside #a div , can i get that if it was clicked on #a or #b
[06:56:30] <Cork> dudeJi: not sure what you're asking there
[06:56:35] <hellyeah> can you fiddle it=
[06:56:40] <Cork> but if you mean if it will match .abc in both, then yes it will
[06:56:53] <dudeJi> yeah cork
[06:57:11] <dudeJi> i want to know if .abc was inside #a or #b
[06:57:31] <Cork> if($(this).closest('#a').length > 0) {} else {}
[06:57:47] <dudeJi> ohh yeah wow
[06:57:50] <dudeJi> thanx
[06:58:03] <Cork> np
[07:06:43] <reca-cabanz> Hey guys, I made some jquery tab under Wordpress. I don't know why it won't work.
[07:07:24] <hellyeah> cliche question but
[07:07:30] <hellyeah> did you check the console?
[07:07:35] <reca-cabanz> Yeah
[07:07:40] <reca-cabanz> no errors.
[07:07:56] <Cork> reca-cabanz: define "won't work"
[07:08:03] <hellyeah> may be it is about browser
[07:08:17] <reca-cabanz> It's like can't locate the js
[07:08:41] <Cork> i meant, it doesn't render
[07:08:49] <Cork> you can't interact with it
[07:08:53] <Cork> or... what?
[07:09:41] <Cork> "won't work", "doesn't work" and the like is pointless cause they doesn't give enough info about what the problem is
[07:10:02] <hellyeah> reca-cabanz: if you do kind of fiddle
[07:10:13] <Cork> hellyeah: a fiddle won't help
[07:10:16] <hellyeah> i am sure Cork can help you very well
[07:10:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:10:22] <hellyeah> live site?
[07:10:34] <Cork> a like would help ya
[07:13:01] <reca-cabanz> Ths is what I did http://fsrg.com/blogpage/?page_id=14
[07:13:07] <reca-cabanz> I made tabs
[07:14:28] <Cork> reca-cabanz: where is the code to enable the tabs?
[07:15:07] <Cork> reca-cabanz: btw, your loading three versions of jquery on that site...
[07:15:32] <Cork> (most likely not the best idea)
[07:15:52] <Cork> oh, i missed one so it is 4
[07:16:18] <reca-cabanz> enable the tabs?
[07:16:26] <Cork> reca-cabanz: also you're not loading jquery ui
[07:16:46] <Cork> tabs isn't part of jquery core, it is part of jquery ui
[07:17:18] <reca-cabanz> That 5 btns
[07:17:38] <Cork> you mean the 5 links?
[07:17:51] <reca-cabanz> that blue
[07:17:54] <Cork> ya, those would work with jquery ui tabs, if you had jqeury ui loaded
[07:18:07] <Cork> and if you initiated them with the tabs part of ui
[07:18:23] <reca-cabanz> Those blue btns are my tabs
[07:18:28] <Cork> but currently you don't load jquery ui, and isn't initialiting the .tabs()
[07:19:50] <reca-cabanz> Yeah that's what my question is the calling the jquery
[07:20:37] <reca-cabanz> Content is still the same once tab is clicked
[07:20:41] <Cork> reca-cabanz: i've answered it twice, read through the log
[07:24:43] <reca-cabanz> Im confuse
[07:25:02] <reca-cabanz> loading jquery ui
[07:26:43] <hellyeah> in order to load jquery you need some library
[07:26:48] <Cork> reca-cabanz: 1) you include jquery-1.4.2 from googlapi, followed by jquery-1.11.1 from googleapi, followed by jquery-1.11.0 from your site, followed by jquery-1.11.3 from your site
[07:26:58] <Cork> that will cause problem you should clean up that
[07:27:11] <Cork> 2) you aren't loading any jquery-ui lib
[07:27:23] <hellyeah> why you load for jquery files
[07:27:36] <hellyeah> what browser do you plan to care
[07:27:39] <Cork> hellyeah: what you what?
[07:27:39] <hellyeah> i.e. 8?
[07:28:04] <hellyeah> seems like same files, different versions
[07:28:05] <hellyeah> right
[07:28:24] <Cork> yes, most likley the wordpress plugins loads there own version of jquery
[07:28:30] <Cork> and creates a complete mess of js
[07:28:34] <reca-cabanz> I don't know exactly on how to load them into one.
[07:28:46] <Cork> reca-cabanz: you don't load them into one
[07:28:53] <Cork> you stop loading all but one
[07:29:04] <hellyeah> just load 1.4.2 for example
[07:29:06] <Cork> i would recommend keeping the 1.11.3 and remove the lest
[07:29:09] <hellyeah> then load ui lib
[07:29:09] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[07:29:15] <hellyeah> 1.11.3 okey
[07:29:38] <Cork> but ya, the javascript dependency on that site is a mess
[07:30:09] <Cork> also i get TypeError: $(...).pajinate is not a function
[07:30:19] <Cork> and a parser error for the js in the body
[07:32:04] <reca-cabanz> so I just need to load this alone 1.4.2 , right?
[07:32:26] <hellyeah> 1.11.3
[07:32:27] <Cork> 1.4.2 is quite old
[07:32:35] <hellyeah> 1.11.3 is older
[07:32:38] <Cork> no
[07:32:42] <Cork> O_o
[07:32:43] <hellyeah> ops
[07:32:46] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:32:46] <hellyeah> hahah
[07:33:01] <hellyeah> dont forget to include jquery libs
[07:33:04] <hellyeah> just a sec
[07:33:05] <Cork> hellyeah: please check your facts before commenting
[07:33:26] <Somatt> hi
[07:33:31] <Cork> reca-cabanz: you should start by checking what version the different jquery plugins your using support
[07:33:38] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:33:39] <Cork> then pick the newest version that all of them support
[07:33:45] <Cork> but just one version
[07:34:02] <hellyeah> reca-cabanz: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/base/jquery-ui.css  , http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.min.js
[07:34:14] <Cork> reca-cabanz: then fetch a jquery ui version that works with that version of jquery
[07:34:24] <Cork> hellyeah: your jumping the gun again...
[07:34:45] <Cork> reca-cabanz: and don't forget the css for the jquery ui package
[07:35:00] <Cork> and after that you can initiate the tabs wiget
[07:35:44] <Somatt> I have an issue with 1.11.3 in IE8: I get errors in the console when jquery initializes in the detach() function: detach: function( selector ) { 		return this.remove( selector, true ); } -> ‘Object doesn't support property or method 'remove'
[07:35:44] <Somatt> ‘
[07:36:39] <Cork> uh
[07:36:46] <Somatt> I’m using browserify, so maybe that could explain how it could have not been noticed yet.What do you htink ?
[07:37:11] <Cork> Somatt: ya, sounds like it is overloading the dom method remove
[07:37:42] <Cork> i would at least start with testing without browserify
[07:38:39] <Somatt> Cork: afaik there is no remove method on the window object
[07:38:55] <Cork> you can't detatch on a window object...
[07:39:06] <Cork> window isn't a real dom element
[07:39:13] <Cork> so it can't be a parent or a child
[07:39:35] <Somatt> I think in this case ‘this’ should point to jquery, and instead points to the global object
[07:39:52] <Cork> likely
[07:39:57] <Somatt> not sure who’s wrongfully making the assumption though
[07:40:09] <Cork> but in that cause it is cause something is rebinding or similar
[07:40:20] <Cork> $().detatch.bind() for example
[07:40:33] <Cork> or $.fn.detatch(null, args)
[07:40:39] <Somatt> I don’t think so
[07:40:50] <Cork> well that is the only way for this to be window
[07:41:01] <Cork> unless you explicitly set it somewhere
[07:41:22] <Cork> actually i would look so it isn't a plugin detecting ie and doing something funky
[07:41:46] <Cork> if you can reproduce it in a jsfiddle it would be a good start
[07:42:57] <Somatt> jsfiddle doesn’t work with ie8
[07:43:27] <Cork> well it does
[07:43:34] <Cork> but it looks a bit funk
[07:43:36] <Cork> +y
[07:46:23] <hellyeah> i couldnt view jsfiddle in i.e.8
[07:48:07] <Cork> could have regressed since last i used it i guess
[07:48:17] <Cork> not many care about ie < 9 anymore
[07:51:15] <Somatt> Cork: detach() is called by doScrollCheck in a setTimeout, and it seems it should endup in the detach function but ends up in the detach method instead
[07:51:51] <Cork> uh, what do you mena function vs method?
[07:52:03] <Cork> there are no methods in javascript
[07:52:14] <slax0r> was just wondering, since when does JS have methods
[07:53:11] <taplar> hmm, i usually use them interchangably
[07:53:19] <taplar> the words that is
[07:53:33] <Somatt> I mean it should go in function detach() { but it goes in jQuery.fn.extend({…detach: function( selector ) instead
[07:54:39] <Cork> Somatt: what is function detach suppose to be?
[07:54:57] <Cork> Somatt: i think you need to show the code
[07:56:07] <Somatt> Cork: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.11.3/dist/jquery.js#L3485
[07:56:12] <slax0r> taplar: function is, well, a function, a method is a class member(function)
[07:56:28] <Somatt> Cork: and it ends up there instead https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.11.3/dist/jquery.js#L5907
[07:56:51] <Cork> oh, didn't know there was a separate function in jquery called detach
[07:56:53] <Somatt> Cork: when coming from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.11.3/dist/jquery.js#L3502
[07:58:02] <Cork> Somatt: well detach is called from the ready pipeline
[07:58:11] <Cork> i don't see how anything outside that could reach it
[08:05:33] <Somatt> the issue is indeed due to the fact that IE doesn’t understand strict mode
[08:05:52] <Somatt> cork: here’s the output of console.log('_', this, detach) just above the detach function:
[08:06:05] <Somatt> chrome: _ undefined detach(){if(document.addEventListener){document.removeEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",completed,false);window.removeEventListener("load",completed,false);}else {document.detachEvent("onready…
[08:06:18] <Somatt> ie8: _ [object Window] function detach(selector){return this.remove(selector,true);}
[08:06:46] <Cork> not sure why that would depend on strict mode
[08:07:11] <Somatt> strict mode makes the execution context undefined instead of global object
[08:07:53] <Cork> ya, but something has to redefine detatch for that to happen
[08:08:20] <Cork> function detach doesn't become a global just cause it is defined in a none strict environment
[08:08:27] <Somatt> jquery does, in a way
[08:08:32] <Cork> no
[08:09:09] <Cork> the detach function you referenced doesn't use this
[08:09:18] <Mark_2> does anybody know how i can emulate this drag button on the configure panel on the rightside of this page? it changes the width of the body by dragging it http://www.undsgn.com/uncode/home/blog-metro/
[08:09:24] <Cork> and the other function is a prototype on jquery
[08:09:37] <Cork> so none of those would inherently reference window
[08:09:42] <Somatt> true
[08:10:29] <Cork> Somatt: i would recommend making a small clean testcase
[08:10:43] <Cork> and then slowly add things from the problematic page until you get the problem
[08:10:55] <Cork> i suspect it is either an object modification you do somewhere
[08:10:58] <Cork> or a plugin causing this
[08:11:29] <Cork> most likely somewhere you call a function that in is isn't called on an object
[08:11:33] <Cork> so it references window
[08:16:39] <Somatt> Cork: it seems babelify is what causes this odd behaviour
[08:16:58] <Cork> suspected as much (that it was a plugin)
[08:17:11] <Somatt> I now have only jquery in the browserify dependency tree, and it works without it and fails when it is plugged
[08:17:25] <Cork> there you go :)
[08:17:34] <Mark_2> does anybody know how i can create that drag button that adjusts website’s width? http://imgur.com/gnS5ILX (screenshot) http://www.undsgn.com/uncode/home/blog-metro/ (realpage)
[08:18:08] <Somatt> thanks Cork, I’ll open an issue when I know for sure where it belongs
[08:18:18] <Cork> nice
[08:18:36] <taplar> Mark_2: are you trying to figure out what they're doing so you can do it too?
[08:18:52] <Mark_2> um no..
[08:19:00] <Mark_2> i just need that particular button.
[08:19:28] <taplar> the cog icon?
[08:19:44] <Mark_2> hmm?
[08:19:47] <Mark_2> what is cog icon?
[08:20:00] <Mark_2> okay, if you click on that icon
[08:20:06] <Mark_2> you see the panel opening up
[08:20:09] <taplar> yup
[08:20:10] <Mark_2> click on the ‘boxed'
[08:20:14] <Mark_2> then you’ll see the
[08:20:21] <Mark_2> drag button i dont’ know what it is called
[08:20:23] <Mark_2> but anyways,
[08:20:28] <Mark_2> you’ll see my point.
[08:21:04] <Mark_2> it adjusts the width of the body.
[08:21:21] <taplar> i see it adjusted the page width.  not sure what your calling 'drag'
[08:21:40] <Mark_2> did you click the boxed?
[08:21:48] <taplar> yep
[08:21:54] <Mark_2> then there is that grey bar thingy right below the button
[08:22:03] <Mark_2> try to move it around left and right
[08:22:05] <taplar> oh!
[08:22:12] <taplar> that's a slider
[08:22:26] <Mark_2> now, i know how to make a button that changes css by giving onclick function
[08:22:30] <Mark_2> but i don’t know how to make That.
[08:22:36] <taplar> look at jquery mobile slider, though you may can do it without jquery mobile
[08:22:58] <Mark_2> i’ll definitely look into it, but i doubt i can figure it out alone lol
[08:23:19] <taplar> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-slider.html
[08:23:44] <Mark_2> i found it, but i don’t know how to give it any function
[08:24:21] <taplar> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/slider/
[08:24:27] <taplar> more details
[08:24:44] <Mark_2> thanks for the help.
[08:25:57] <taplar> that's a little strange though
[08:26:04] <Mark_2> what is?
[08:26:20] <taplar> having an input the changes the display width
[08:26:25] <7F1AA0NWY> If I use jquery to bind a click even to all anchors.  Will new anchors have that bound event or will I have to wait until after the elements are created to bind them?
[08:26:33] <Mark_2> yeah… i have no clue
[08:26:34] <taplar> seems like you would want to do a viewport and adjust your styling based on media queries
[08:26:44] <7F1AA0NWY> http://jsfiddle.net/tt8ws1at/
[08:27:03] <taplar> 7F1AA0NWY: it will only exist on the ones you bound to
[08:27:17] <taplar> 7F1AA0NWY: otherwise you would need to bind to the new ones, or delegate bind to a parent
[08:27:42] <taplar> which it looks like you are delegate binding
[08:28:24] <taplar> so as long as new elements have that rowAction class, your good
[08:28:31] <taplar> *and are in that table
[08:28:46] <7F1AA0NWY> I see
[08:29:40] <7F1AA0NWY> That's a really greate feature .  I didn't realize that's what this code was doing.  I was trying to change it for my specific needs.
[08:29:51] <7F1AA0NWY> This is what I was working from:  http://jsfiddle.net/5nmwdrwu/1/
[08:30:46] <taplar> oh, you do have an issue
[08:31:06] <taplar> your delegate binding on table, but your table(s) are being created in your click, so that's not gonna work
[08:31:26] <taplar> you should delegate bind to #something_that_exists instead
[08:36:36] <7F1AA0NWY> By any chance is delegate binding a form of late binding?
[08:36:48] <7F1AA0NWY> At the guts I mean.
[08:37:31] <taplar> you bind to a parent with the intention of processing the bubbled events
[08:37:51] <taplar> of which you filter against the child selector to know when/how to proceed
[08:37:51] <7F1AA0NWY> So it is late binding...runtime binding.
[08:38:02] <taplar> no, your still binding, just to the parent
[08:38:22] <taplar> it's all runtime binding, :)
[08:38:30] <7F1AA0NWY> True.
[08:39:19] <7F1AA0NWY> But you are "binding" an event to an element which doesn't directly have that even bound to it.
[08:39:37] <taplar> it does
[08:39:52] <taplar> but it's handling of that event is checking the original event that created it
[08:40:28] <7F1AA0NWY> Right.  That's what I mean.  The bound event on the parent is the event processor or "late bind" the children events.
[08:40:45] <7F1AA0NWY> to not or
[08:41:13] <taplar> personally i wouldn't phrase it like that, but that's just me
[08:42:20] <7F1AA0NWY> That seems to be what it's doing to me though.  You bind an event processor to the parent for late binding on the children...although it
[08:42:24] <7F1AA0NWY> s not a compiled language
[08:42:35] <taplar> but your not binding on the children
[08:42:46] <7F1AA0NWY> No.
[08:42:58] <taplar> so 'late binding' is weird phrasing
[08:43:25] <7F1AA0NWY> But there is an event bound to the children, which in turn results in another "even" being fired affecting the children.
[08:43:30] <taplar> no
[08:43:34] <taplar> nothing is bound to the children
[08:43:49] <7F1AA0NWY> Hoe does a child even bubble?
[08:43:55] <7F1AA0NWY> Something must be bound to them.
[08:43:55] <taplar> event handlers are bound to elements
[08:44:03] <taplar> events are simply created and bubble
[08:44:10] <7F1AA0NWY> I see
[08:44:50] <7F1AA0NWY> If I have $('table').on('click', '.someclass', function(event){ $(this) });
[08:45:12] <7F1AA0NWY> Does $(this) refer to the $('table') or to the '.someclass'?
[08:45:35] <taplar> the delegate makes it so that the event handler is applied to the child element, so 'this' referrs to the child
[08:45:43] <7F1AA0NWY> Excellent.
[08:45:48] <7F1AA0NWY> Thanks.
[08:45:52] <taplar> np
[09:32:42] <Mark_2> can anyone check my coding if i’ve done something wrong?
[09:33:12] <tocka> ..
[09:38:10] <hellyeah> ey
[09:38:26] <hellyeah> is there a method in jquery for up arrow and down arrow
[09:38:29] <hellyeah> like
[09:38:44] <hellyeah> i will do a button for going up and going down in the some div
[09:38:58] <hellyeah> like a vertical scroll is there any evet for that?
[09:39:28] <taplar> as opposed to a scrollbar?
[09:39:47] <hellyeah> yes
[09:39:51] <taplar> y?
[09:39:59] <hellyeah> like a scrollbar two buttons one for up one for down
[09:40:13] <hellyeah> check this http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/271/embedded/result/
[09:40:19] <hellyeah> scrollbar is implemented
[09:40:24] <hellyeah> ,
[09:40:51] <hellyeah> i need to buttons that behavbes like scroll bar
[09:40:58] <hellyeah> my english is limited sorry for that
[09:41:34] <Mark_2> where are you from
[09:41:53] <7F1AA0NWY> Is there a better way to do this:
[09:41:54] <7F1AA0NWY> http://jsfiddle.net/z9f8dzv0/
[09:42:12] <hellyeah> i am from Turkey
[09:42:28] <Mark_2> what are you building right now?  a website?
[09:42:38] <hellyeah> somewhat
[09:42:47] <hellyeah> i try to write inquiry application
[09:42:57] <hellyeah> when you click button you will get related table
[09:44:28] <hellyeah> taplar: did you understand what i asked
[09:44:57] <taplar> kinda, eating right now so one finger typing
[09:45:03] <Mark_2> lol.
[09:45:42] <hellyeah> ic
[09:45:48] <hellyeah> have a nice dinner
[09:45:53] <taplar> what in the use case for the arrows?
[09:46:07] <hellyeah> you see scroll bar right
[09:46:11] <taplar> yup
[09:46:25] <hellyeah> okey
[09:46:31] <hellyeah> forget about that scroll bar
[09:46:48] <hellyeah> and think about two buttons one for scroll up the other for for scroll down
[09:47:03] <hellyeah> i am wondering is there any spesific event for that
[09:47:03] <taplar> why that instead of the scrollbar?
[09:47:14] <hellyeah> well
[09:47:40] <hellyeah> i just added that and i said it was just one line i added for scroll bar to my co-worker
[09:47:55] <hellyeah> he responded do that i meantioned here instead
[09:48:03] <taplar> -_-
[09:48:07] <hellyeah> thats funny but not much i can do
[09:48:09] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:48:21] <hellyeah> taplar: is that sad face right?
[09:48:27] <taplar> yup
[09:48:47] <hellyeah> taplar: good news is it worked in i.e11 probably it will work in i.e 10
[09:48:49] <taplar> you can do that but it is not very intuitive
[09:48:59] <hellyeah> and this looks nice in 1024 resolutşion
[09:49:04] <hellyeah> resolution
[09:49:12] <taplar> and its not a given event.  that will be a custom thing
[09:49:23] <hellyeah> hmm he also asked me that not seeing tabular data on view source
[09:49:32] <hellyeah> thats why i did AJAX
[09:49:37] <taplar> lol
[09:49:41] <hellyeah> i examined some examples on the net
[09:49:50] <hellyeah> tabular data appears everywhere
[09:49:53] <hellyeah> so i dont know
[09:49:56] <taplar> sounds like he isn't familiar with web dev
[09:50:07] <hellyeah> i just will do what i have to do
[09:50:14] <hellyeah> actually it is not web
[09:50:18] <hellyeah> it is inside thing
[09:50:26] <taplar> browser = web dev
[09:50:30] <hellyeah> people who works here use that this
[09:50:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:50:37] <hellyeah> i didnt know that
[09:50:54] <hellyeah> i am writing c#
[09:50:55] <taplar> intra/extra net is just a subcategory
[09:50:58] <hellyeah> i am writing js, css
[09:51:02] <hellyeah> i am also writing sql
[09:51:07] <hellyeah> thats a bit much
[09:51:42] <hellyeah> anyway lets get bac to topic
[09:52:02] <hellyeah> what do you mean by custom thing? Can you suggest me something for reading?
[09:55:37] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollTop
[09:56:13] <taplar> logically what your asking is to have two buttons that adjust an elements scrollTop
[09:56:27] <taplar> err buttons/links/whatever
[09:56:45] <hellyeah> i guess
[09:56:51] <hellyeah> like scrollTop = 1
[09:56:56] <hellyeah> or scrollTop = -1
[09:56:59] <taplar> so that's some combination of scrollTop and click and/or mousepress events
[09:57:31] <hellyeah> yeah when you click button you can hold it
[09:58:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:58:16] <taplar> but it really feels like that is reinventing the wheel
[09:58:34] <hellyeah> so
[09:58:36] <taplar> scrollbar exists and is pretty much universally understood
[09:58:40] <hellyeah> i will invent America again
[09:58:56] <hellyeah> xD
[09:59:18] <hellyeah> actually those kind of thing is good for me
[09:59:25] <hellyeah> you know it may look absurd
[09:59:35] <hellyeah> but i am learning stuff really well
[10:00:00] <hellyeah> i think scroll bar is enough
[10:00:11] <hellyeah> but sometimes you just do the stuff
[10:13:18] <developer818> Quick question, new to javascript and jquery how can I translate this javascript into proper jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/fuqwk4b2/
[10:14:38] <hellyeah> use $('..')
[10:15:02] <hellyeah> lemme try smt
[10:15:18] <sigdk> is this the right channel for DataTables questions ?
[10:15:35] <taplar> developer818: you should give learn.jquery.com a browse for starters
[10:15:42] <hellyeah> dunno equivalence of onload
[10:16:47] <hellyeah> yeah check those video
[10:17:24] <developer818> Thanks taplar and hellyeah
[10:18:03] <hellyeah> you can select element with $('..')
[10:18:09] <hellyeah> and javascript has css method
[10:18:35] <hellyeah> css('stylename', 'value') like css('background-color', 'black')
[10:18:37] <hellyeah> fr exampole
[10:22:40] <hellyeah> brb
[10:24:16] <sigdk> This is a DataTable: http://paste.debian.net/333338/    I'd like to use the two columns at the end (<img src="images/95.png"> and 115.png) to pop up a window on click and edit the profile of a user. How can I implement that ? Any hints ?
[10:25:42] <seventhshift> hey, so I have a bunch of elements, some have a prefix in their ID, some don't. examples: CO-190555 and sl-CO-190555. I need to use regex to grab all that don't have the sl- prefix. I have seen some things about negative lookahead expressions, but I couldn't get those working right. any help?
[10:25:52] <seventhshift> ...wat
[10:26:09] <seventhshift> sorry, nvm, my hexchat gimped out for a second
[10:26:16] <seventhshift> disregard the wat
[10:26:55] <seventhshift> current regex literal I have (does not work): /^((?!^sl-$).)[cdst]/i
[10:27:34] <seventhshift> attempting to grab everything that does not start with sl- and has a c, d, s, or t in the beginning, case insensitive
[10:31:36] <taplar> seventhshift: do these elements have anything else in common?
[10:32:35] <Mark_2> um,
[10:32:47] <Mark_2> can anyone take a look at my code, and tell me what’s wrong?
[10:33:12] <seventhshift> taplar with one exception, they have two alphanumeric characters, a dash, then some numbers (variable length)
[10:33:35] <seventhshift> the first character is c,d,s, or t, the second character is either an O or a 0-9
[10:33:51] <seventhshift> and the one exception to all of that doesn't matter so much
[10:33:53] <taplar> i mean anything else?  are they the same tag? or do they belong to a shared parent?
[10:33:57] <seventhshift> oh yeah
[10:34:03] <seventhshift> they're all <tr>s
[10:34:07] <taplar> awesome
[10:34:52] <taplar> $('tr').not('[id^="sl-"]') to get all but the sl- ones
[10:36:33] <seventhshift> haha that's so much simpler than the direction I was going
[10:36:36] <seventhshift> thank you taplar
[10:41:07] <WrinkledCheese> Is there a more jquery like way to do this:  http://jsfiddle.net/z9f8dzv0/
[10:41:47] <WrinkledCheese> Prevent another bubbling event from executing the click?
[10:46:22] <Somatt> Cork: as a follow up, the problem ends up being due to browserify itself. Issieu is at https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1432
[10:49:06] <jphase> WrinkledCheese: you need an event to bind to like 'click' or something, but this is an example: http://kopy.io/WCXCg
[11:48:56] <jsparks> hi, does anyone is know http://www.daterangepicker.com/ ?
[11:50:10] <jsparks> I've got a little issue with this plugin my server date field get override by the plugin any ideia of what might be?
[11:51:12] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:52:19] <jomofcw> Using the example for "itemRender" about extension point for ui.autocomplete, I get the error "TypeError: this._renderItem(...) is undefined". Any idea how to fix it ?
[11:56:03] <jomofcw> I find this stackoverflow about this, but it does not seems to use the widget factory : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15741639/jquery-autocomplete-gives-typeerror-this-renderitem-is-undefined
[11:59:31] <jomofcw> It's about the call of _renderItemDate that I didn't change/extend.
[12:20:11] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[12:20:38] <phpcoder> why document.getElementById("search").submit();  submit the form instead of calling $("#search").submit(function(event) {  ....
[12:20:40] <phpcoder> ?
[12:21:14] <robertmaxrees> $("#search").submit(function(event) { is an event binding.
[12:21:16] <jsparks> Anyone?
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> see how you're passing a function to it?
[12:21:37] <phpcoder> yes
[12:21:54] <robertmaxrees> also, the first one is native DOM methods.  the second one uses jQuery.
[12:28:10] <zagaza-> hi guys, when you press the button, the button fills with a black background color.. how can I repeat this animation? so each time it reaches top, it starts from the bottom again? http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/409/
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- by resetting the styles.
[12:29:31] <zagaza-> which styles?
[12:29:40] <robertmaxrees> the ones in withVelocity
[12:29:54] <taplar> side note, cache your btn lookup
[12:30:22] <robertmaxrees> that, too.  also, don't un-bind the mouseover and mouseleave handlers.
[12:30:43] <zagaza-> unbind the mouseover and mouseleave??
[12:30:46] <zagaza-> sry I'm a bit new with this
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[12:30:58] <robertmaxrees> oh - have you thought to run through a tutorial?
[12:30:58] <zagaza-> why though?
[12:31:01] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, so how can i call a jquery object from js ?
[12:31:05] <zagaza-> I have run through a tutorial or two
[12:31:06] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder you can't.
[12:31:25] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- a lot of this is pretty basic, so i'm not sure where you're lost.
[12:31:30] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder what are you trying to fix?
[12:32:30] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, my problem is that i am using nouiSlider i use the update event of this component.... (it is not using jquery) then i use other components with jquery
[12:32:40] <phpcoder> the problem is that every change ineed to submit the form
[12:32:52] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder then use the native dom methods to do it - why is that an issue?
[12:32:53] <phpcoder> i listen to submit event to make an ajax call
[12:33:08] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, because i have to do a ajax call
[12:33:18] <phpcoder> i would like to write this call ONE time
[12:33:27] <phpcoder> and at the moment i do that inside the .submit() event
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees> right, so just call just .submit()
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't see what's stopping you from doing that.
[12:33:57] <robertmaxrees> though it'd be better if you could just call the ajax submit code directly.
[12:34:04] <taplar> ^
[12:34:38] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, from the native component i do submit()
[12:34:46] <phpcoder> but jquery does not get this event
[12:34:56] <phpcoder> i see the refresh
[12:35:04] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder why are you mixing native and jquery?
[12:35:06] <phpcoder> i tried putting an alert() but it is not called
[12:35:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost .
[12:35:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:35:23] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, because nouislider works with native js....other with jquery
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with noUiSlider.
[12:35:46] <robertmaxrees> and have used it to trigger ajax submits.  it works fine for that.
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure where you're lost.
[12:36:25] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, yes it work with ajax....BUT i would like to avoid creating an ajax call for jquery component and for uinoslider component
[12:36:31] <phpcoder> i would like to write it ONE time
[12:36:38] <phpcoder> maybe i can create a method that send this request
[12:36:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't -you make one ajax handler.
[12:36:42] <phpcoder> instead of use -submit()
[12:36:47] <robertmaxrees> err, ajax method, and then call that directly.
[12:37:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll still need your submit handler, but the data submission part of things should be separate.
[12:37:18] <phpcoder> ok i will create updateContent() and i will call that funtion from jquery and from nouislider
[12:37:44] <robertmaxrees> that's all you needed i think.
[12:39:16] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i thought that submitting the form will trigger my jquery.submit() callback
[12:39:26] <phpcoder> but it is triggered from jquery components only
[12:39:30] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> DOM and jquery events are distinct from each other.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> but that's a bad idea.
[12:39:55] <robertmaxrees> call your ajax code explicitly instead.
[12:40:36] <phpcoder> ok i will create a callback and i will call that callback from jquery and from other native components
[12:40:39] <phpcoder> thank robertmaxrees
[12:40:47] <robertmaxrees> and btw, it's not "jquery components"
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> it's just code that uses jquery :)
[12:41:12] <phpcoder> yes yes :D
[12:41:13] <phpcoder> eeheh
[12:41:23] <phpcoder> i mean inside the $(function(){.....})
[12:41:24] <phpcoder> ahah
[12:41:30] <robertmaxrees> that's just a document ready.
[12:41:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing more.
[12:41:51] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, how can i call the callback from noUiSlider?
[12:41:59] <phpcoder> you told me there is a ajax handler
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> after you drag and drop a handle?
[12:42:29] <phpcoder> yes.... at the moment i used change event
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> http://refreshless.com/nouislider/events-callbacks/
[12:43:01] <zagaza-> not sure what to say robertmaxrees, even though I've gone through some tutorials, I don't know where in this function I should remove the styles, nor how to remove them since there are no certain classes applied that do the animation
[12:43:01] <phpcoder> yes ok inside the "change" event
[12:43:03] <phpcoder> thanks!
[12:43:13] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- see all the .css() calls?
[12:43:19] <zagaza-> ya
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you comment out that withVelocity() function call?
[12:44:00] <zagaza-> just a basic hover function, on hover the button turns black and the text turns white
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[12:44:28] <zagaza-> that styles are being applied?
[12:44:47] <robertmaxrees> and that withVelocity is the function applying the styles you care about.
[12:45:15] <zagaza-> ah yes
[12:46:41] <zagaza-> although robertmaxrees, I added $('.btn').style.attr = '  '; inside that function, but now nothing really happens on click http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/412/
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you see?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> i don't evem need to look at the fiddle to know what it's going to tell you :)
[12:47:36] <robertmaxrees> also: you didn't uncomment the withVelocity call
[12:50:21] <zagaza-> hmm.. Cannot set property 'attr' of undefined    http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/412/
[12:50:32] <zagaza-> why undefined tho? it has styles?
[12:50:54] <robertmaxrees> becuase you can't call native DOM methods on jquery objects.
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> meaning $('.btn').style isn't anything.
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> there is no "style" property on $('.btn') - you need to use .prop() or .attr() to access that.  or use .css() again.
[12:51:44] <robertmaxrees> even better, use classes.
[12:51:56] <zagaza-> ahh ok
[12:52:58] <mellybean> does anyone know any jquery  plugins that is similar to JIRAs left hand sidebar? where it collapses to a thin nav bar with icons?
[12:53:15] <robertmaxrees> mellybean you don't need an entire plugin for that.
[12:56:36] <mellybean> I know, I can probably write it from scratch, but for the sake of speed + hackathon, it would be nice
[13:38:41] <zagaza-> robertmaxrees still around?
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> yep
[13:40:59] <zagaza-> been struggling with this damn animation.. I tried removing the css like $div.css({"top":"", "background-color":""}); but even that doesnt do the trick http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/418/
[13:42:30] <robertmaxrees> is velocity async?
[13:42:37] <robertmaxrees> also, you need to feed actual values.
[13:46:45] <zagaza-> not sure if its async, its a plugin
[13:46:45] <zagaza-> ah ok
[13:46:47] <zagaza-> gonna try
[13:46:53] <prestorium> hi. I'm doing this: $([1, 2, 3]).each(foo()); foo() { $.ajax('localhost/foo'); } . Firefox starts all 3 request at the same time, but my nginx only process req2 after req1 and req3 after both. What am I missing?
[13:47:26] <prestorium> Am I doing the jquery part correctly?
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- being a plugin has nothing to do with whether or not it's async ;)
[13:47:37] <zagaza-> tried feeding actual values like $div.css({"top":"100%", "background-color":"#fff"}); but still no changes
[13:47:44] <robertmaxrees> prestorium what is [1, 2, 3]
[13:49:23] <prestorium> robertmaxrees, an array of objects. I have something like foo.index = 0; $.each(); foo() { p = objs[i++]; }
[13:50:07] <prestorium> s/i++/index++/
[13:50:07] <b-ot> Correction, <prestorium> robertmaxrees, an array of objects. I have something like foo.index = 0; $.each(); foo() { p = objs[index++]; }
[13:50:35] <prestorium> wow!!! :D
[13:50:35] <robertmaxrees> prestorium that's the wrong each
[13:51:36] <prestorium> robertmaxrees, what's wrong? I copied-paste it from stackoverflow :( I'm trying to understand what am I missing
[13:53:10] <prestorium> robertmaxrees, or even better: what am I trying to do? I googled for 'javascript parallel ajax'
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> what ARE you trying to do?
[13:53:36] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run a bunch of ajax calls in parallel?
[13:54:03] <prestorium> robertmaxrees, yes. I want to run a lot of parallel ajax calls
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> basically,  $([1, 2, 3]).each(foo()); foo() { $.ajax('localhost/foo'); }  makes no sense.
[13:54:22] <robertmaxrees> $().each() takes a jquery object, you're just passing an array.
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> just use the native forEach() instead.
[13:54:52] <robertmaxrees> forEach(foo()); won't run when you think it does - you need to do forEach(foo)
[13:55:23] <robertmaxrees> as far as your base issue, it sounds like the real problem isn't jquery but nginx
[13:56:00] <prestorium> robertmaxrees, yeah... I do think that I must tweak nginx, but I thought I was doing something wrong at jquery side
[13:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you were :)
[13:56:20] <robertmaxrees> but it wasn't causing the issues you thought it was.
[13:56:33] <prestorium> :)
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> and are you sure nginx is to blame and not your application?
[13:57:41] <prestorium> not yet. But the application is a php code igniter app. There is no kind of lock as far as I can see. So, maybe it is some nginx flag I forgot.
[13:58:07] <robertmaxrees> i would triple-check that what you're doing in the php side is able to be done synchronously.  there are some limitations to how that all can work.
[13:58:18] <prestorium> I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why I was wrong. I mean: from firebug console, I saw a lot of "parallel" requests
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> your code may have functioned, but it was incorrect and prone to some nasty bugs.
[13:59:24] <prestorium> ah! OK.
[13:59:28] <prestorium> thanks!
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/85c15ebbc93a
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> this is what is should look like.
[14:59:08] <_lazarevsky> hey guys
[14:59:13] <_lazarevsky> I need help generating JSON
[14:59:23] <_lazarevsky> so I've got a ViewModel javascript object
[15:00:13] <_lazarevsky> I need my json to look like this -> { project: { name: 'asd', id: '1' }, user: { username: 'a' } }
[15:00:15] <_lazarevsky> how an I achieve that?
[15:00:17] <johndoe2> _lazarevsky look at JSON.stringify()
[15:00:24] <robertmaxrees> we have no idea what your "viewModel" is.
[15:00:26] <_lazarevsky> aha stringift
[15:00:31] <robertmaxrees> but you just created the object.
[15:00:45] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: forget about the view Model
[15:00:58] <_lazarevsky> :)
[15:00:59] <_lazarevsky> aha
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> i figured that was irrelevant,
[15:01:13] <robertmaxrees> but you have your object.
[15:01:19] <t4nk179> could anyone explain this selector to me a[href*=#]:not([href=#])
[15:01:22] <robertmaxrees> like... sending it to your server should work.
[15:01:30] <_lazarevsky> so can I just go -> data = "{ project: { name: 'asd', id: '1' }, user: { username: 'a' } }"
[15:01:41] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky no.
[15:01:52] <robertmaxrees> what's going to consume this data?
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> t4nk179 all links that contain a hash that aren't just the hash.
[15:01:57] <_lazarevsky> a rails backend
[15:02:05] <t4nk179> thanks!
[15:02:14] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky via ajax?
[15:02:19] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: correct
[15:02:21] <t4nk179> can i add on anoter not after this one
[15:02:24] <t4nk179> so that also not #modal ?
[15:02:36] <robertmaxrees> should just be able to $.ajax({data: {someProp: 'wee'}}); _lazarevsky
[15:02:41] <t4nk179> a[href*=#]:not([href=#]):not([href*=#modal])
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> t4nk179 sure, though i'd just use filter at that point.
[15:02:57] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: but pay attention
[15:03:05] <_lazarevsky> I am sending two objects in the same hash
[15:03:14] <_lazarevsky> project and user
[15:03:16] <t4nk179> filter eh?
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky *object.
[15:03:26] <_lazarevsky> hah fair enough
[15:03:27] <_lazarevsky> :))
[15:03:34] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky ;) and use an array.  otherwise, {user:{}, project:{}};
[15:03:35] <_lazarevsky> I think in terms of objects
[15:03:41] <_lazarevsky> kk
[15:03:42] <_lazarevsky> beautiful
[15:03:43] <_lazarevsky> thanks!
[15:03:54] <robertmaxrees> t4nk179 yeah, return ones that match your requirements.
[15:04:04] <robertmaxrees> selector expressions get long and ugly pretty quick.
[15:04:07] <robertmaxrees> and super hard to read.
[15:04:26] <t4nk179> oh like .filter()
[15:04:51] <robertmaxrees> t4nk179 yeah, not sure what else i would have meant.
[15:06:22] <taplar> coffee
[15:06:51] <t4nk179> got it
[15:06:54] <t4nk179> thanks you rock
[15:08:41] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: here's what the data looks like now
[15:08:42] <_lazarevsky> company[name]:asdasd user[firstName]:
[15:08:49] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:08:51] <_lazarevsky> this I copied from the browser's console
[15:08:52] <robertmaxrees> that's... not anything.
[15:08:54] <_lazarevsky> lemme gist my ajax code
[15:09:34] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/13f613023ec0ec3a710b
[15:10:05] <_lazarevsky> I was expecting the data to look like this {user:{}, project:{}};
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you need to look at the return for the model.get() calls.
[15:10:52] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: returns string
[15:10:57] <robertmaxrees> right, what is the string?
[15:11:00] <robertmaxrees> i need to see the actual data.
[15:11:01] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: lemme hard code those values - makes no difference
[15:11:16] <_lazarevsky> or is it the case that chrome just doesn't show the data in a json format with the curle brackets
[15:11:17] <_lazarevsky> ??
[15:11:28] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what the data is - something seems way off here.
[15:12:32] <robertmaxrees> chrome's console is going to show you a version of the opject that you can like browse through.
[15:12:38] <robertmaxrees> click to expand properties and whatnot.
[15:12:38] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: this is what the data looks like
[15:12:39] <_lazarevsky> company%5Bname%5D=company+name+yo&company%5Battr%5D=some+other+attr&user%5BfirstName%5D=asdasdasd&user%5Basdasd%5D=asdasdasd
[15:12:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> so that's what you get back out of those model.get() calls?
[15:13:18] <_lazarevsky> NO
[15:13:22] <_lazarevsky> lemme gist the updated cod
[15:13:24] <_lazarevsky> +e
[15:13:58] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/49ad6a7e6c1864e702d6
[15:14:21] <t4nk179> is a dash - a special character in a selector?
[15:14:27] <_lazarevsky> here is what google thinks the request payload looks like when parsed -> company[name]:company name yo company[attr]:some other attr user[firstName]:asdasdasd user[asdasd]:asdasdasd
[15:14:39] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: ^
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky screenshot your console for me.
[15:14:53] <robertmaxrees> something seems way bonk - i think you're misunderstanding the consople.
[15:15:04] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: and here's what it looks like when viewed as source -> company%5Bname%5D=company+name+yo&company%5Battr%5D=some+other+attr&user%5BfirstName%5D=asdasdasd&user%5Basdasd%5D=asdasdasd
[15:15:12] <_lazarevsky> grrr
[15:15:12] <_lazarevsky> ok
[15:15:14] <_lazarevsky> 1 sec
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky that's not helpful.
[15:15:18] <_lazarevsky> ye
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/a4afb2570f35 this should show what's actually being sent across.
[15:15:40] <_lazarevsky> oh
[15:15:43] <_lazarevsky> im not stringifying the data!
[15:15:59] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky slow way down
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> you only need to stringify to confirm, though you don't actually need to do that to send it.
[15:16:21] <robertmaxrees> ajax is "stringifying" it for you.
[15:16:30] <robertmaxrees> (not really, but you don't need to worry about that part)
[15:16:47] <robertmaxrees> i think you're just confused by how your developer tools work.  that's why a screenshot would be helpful.
[15:16:59] <robertmaxrees> t4nk179 not that i can recall.
[15:17:04] <t4nk179> cool
[15:18:36] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: screenshot of browser console's Network tab
[15:18:36] <_lazarevsky> http://s24.postimg.org/ckzeefrwl/jquery_prob.png
[15:18:53] <robertmaxrees> lol ah.
[15:18:58] <robertmaxrees> you're REALLY confused :)
[15:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the form post with the ajax post.
[15:19:20] <robertmaxrees> are you preventing default on the form submit event?
[15:19:54] <_lazarevsky> ahhh
[15:19:56] <_lazarevsky> no I'm not
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> :) you're not even using the ajax then.
[15:20:24] <robertmaxrees> when people talk about the console, they mean the console - not the network tab.
[15:21:57] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: damn
[15:22:06] <_lazarevsky> that's what happens when you paste code without checking it first
[15:22:12] <_lazarevsky> thanks
[15:22:19] <robertmaxrees> just slow down and you'll be fine.
[15:25:49] <_lazarevsky> hmm
[15:25:54] <_lazarevsky> I've removed the form tag and the submit button
[15:25:58] <_lazarevsky> but it still sends form data
[15:26:09] <_lazarevsky> so if there's form data in the request then, it's definitely not ajax aye?
[15:26:19] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: what would it say if it sent ajax instead?
[15:26:25] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: what would the section be called?
[15:26:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad way to do that.
[15:26:32] <robertmaxrees> show me your js.
[15:26:38] <robertmaxrees> and slow down.
[15:28:38] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/53098590c8cdedb3c455
[15:28:43] <_lazarevsky> it's handlebars code for the template
[15:28:49] <_lazarevsky> and ember controller
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> i know nothing about ember.
[15:29:14] <NoiseEee> _lazarevsky: #emberjs
[15:29:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:29:21] <robertmaxrees> that's where you want to be.
[15:50:32] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: managed to get to send queryString params
[15:50:44] <_lazarevsky> but they're still messed up
[15:51:06] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:51:33] <_lazarevsky> ya so basically the exact SAME data is showing up in the Query String Parameters section
[15:51:38] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: ^
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> i have no frame of reference.
[15:52:27] <robertmaxrees> code?
[15:52:33] <robertmaxrees> or is this still ember related?
[15:52:43] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: company[name]:asdasdasd user[firstName]:asdasdas
[15:52:53] <_lazarevsky> nope
[15:53:01] <robertmaxrees> right, are you properly preventing the default submit event?
[15:53:02] <_lazarevsky> so this request shows up in the XHR tab
[15:53:06] <_lazarevsky> it's an async request
[15:53:17] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: there's no form
[15:53:20] <_lazarevsky> there's no submit
[15:53:28] <robertmaxrees> show the code then.
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[15:54:37] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: changed the ajax type from POST to GET
[15:54:44] <_lazarevsky> that solved the FORM data problem
[15:54:46] <zagaza-> I asked before, I'll try again. Maybe someone can help me out with this: when you press the button, the button fills with a black background color.. how can I repeat this animation? so each time it reaches top, it starts from the bottom again? http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/409/
[15:54:54] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: but the data format is still shit
[15:55:05] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky you can't send form data with a GET.
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> only post.
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- i explained this earlier.
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> where are you stuck?
[15:55:25] <zagaza-> robertmaxrees we didn't come to any conclusion though
[15:55:31] <zagaza-> I am still stuck at the same place
[15:55:32] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: I am not sending form data!
[15:55:34] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- no - that's your job :)
[15:55:40] <zagaza-> I just can't get it repeating the animation
[15:55:44] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky are you trying to send a post body?
[15:55:49] <_lazarevsky> no
[15:55:53] <_lazarevsky> lemme gist my code
[15:56:00] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky make a fiddle instead.
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- right, so let's stpe through it all again.
[15:56:28] <robertmaxrees> withVelocity is setting a bunch of css values, right?
[15:56:32] <zagaza-> yes
[15:56:44] <robertmaxrees> so first you need to "Re-set" those properties.
[15:58:03] <zagaza-> that's the thing robertmaxrees, I try to reset them like $div.css({"top":"100%", "background-color":"#fff"}); but nothing really changed
[15:58:33] <zagaza-> maybe I am adding it to the wrong place? http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/419/
[15:58:35] <zagaza-> check line 19
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- http://julian.com/research/velocity/ i think you need to read the docs ;)
[15:59:14] <zagaza-> ya? I'm doing something wrong with it?
[15:59:17] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:59:25] <zagaza-> oh hmm
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> like i said earlier, velocity may be async
[15:59:35] <robertmaxrees> looking at the docs, that appears to be the case.
[15:59:47] <zagaza-> what does that tell us though?
[15:59:53] <zagaza-> what changes if it's async?
[16:00:04] <robertmaxrees> that you need to put all relevant code in a callback.
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't just stick it after the velocity calls.
[16:00:45] <zagaza-> so instead of using .css I need to keep using .velocity to reset the styles?
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> http://julian.com/research/velocity/#beginAndComplete
[16:00:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to use the complete callback.
[16:01:23] <zagaza-> oooh
[16:01:24] <zagaza-> thanks man
[16:02:04] <robertmaxrees> start there ans see how far you get.
[16:02:09] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees:
[16:02:10] <_lazarevsky> dude..
[16:02:11] <zagaza-> now I think I can do it :)
[16:02:15] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: after I stringified it worked..
[16:02:28] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky something tells me you're doing something incorrectly, but ok.
[16:02:54] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: may be.. you seem like quite the jquery guru so I wouldn't go against what you're saying.. all I'm saying is that it worked for me :)
[16:03:02] <_lazarevsky> robertmaxrees: thanks so much for yer help!
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> _lazarevsky "it works" is never good enough, but okay.
[16:03:08] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome.
[16:04:43] <themaninthered> quick question i'm sure i'm missing something easy here. i'm using a Jquery.getJSON command, and i'm looping thru the return data with a .each  .. before i loop i want to know how many items were returned. my done statement is .done(function(json) {
[16:04:56] <themaninthered> So naturally i thought "json.length" would return the number of items
[16:04:59] <themaninthered> but it returns undefined.
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> console.log(json);
[16:05:19] <robertmaxrees> what does this give you?
[16:05:27] <themaninthered> a big ass object
[16:05:41] <robertmaxrees> console.log(typeof json);
[16:06:28] <themaninthered> object
[16:06:56] <themaninthered> .each(json, function(i, item) { --- works just fine looping thru it.. each time i use item.id and item.name
[16:06:57] <zagaza-> so robertmaxrees this kind of works: http://jstraight.com/1324/2   but instead of going "Back" to where it started, I just want it to abort, and re-start from the beginning again.. if you know what I mean
[16:07:25] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered slow down yo - $.each() works on plain objects, too.
[16:07:47] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered what about console.log(json.constructor === Array);
[16:07:49] <robertmaxrees> is that true?>
[16:07:58] <themaninthered> lets find out hold on.
[16:08:05] <robertmaxrees> wat why did you move from jsfiddle zagaza-?
[16:08:40] <themaninthered> false
[16:08:41] <robertmaxrees> and zagaza- i said to NOT use velocity again.
[16:08:48] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered that's why - it's not an array.
[16:09:06] <themaninthered> is there a way to count number of item in an object then?
[16:09:14] <zagaza-> robertmaxrees: lol long story, I'll just go back to jsfiddle. Anyway I got it working properly now, I just need to re-run the animation now http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/421/
[16:09:28] <themaninthered> i could loop thru it once and get a count.. but that feels like bad code to e.
[16:09:31] <themaninthered> to me
[16:09:39] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered you can do Object.keys(json).length, but enumerating through objects in general is a bad idea anyway
[16:09:52] <robertmaxrees> zagaza- so go up, down, then up?
[16:09:55] <zagaza-> ok done I think: http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/5r8BY/422/
[16:09:57] <zagaza-> yeah
[16:09:57] <robertmaxrees> or just go up and then "reset"?
[16:10:03] <zagaza-> go up and then "reset" and then go up again
[16:10:11] <zagaza-> that looks proper right? my latest fiddle
[16:10:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you want it to animate like that.
[16:10:38] <robertmaxrees> but sure?  it'll run like that forever.
[16:10:46] <zagaza-> neither do I, the designer wants to animate it like that lol
[16:10:49] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:10:51] <zagaza-> I'm just helping a little
[16:10:58] <themaninthered> that did the trick thanks.
[16:11:00] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty bad, but okay.
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered why not use an array?
[16:11:13] <zagaza-> it's supposed to be a loading effect robertmaxrees
[16:11:23] <themaninthered> because that's what jQuery.getJSON returns
[16:11:26] <phpcoder> hi
[16:11:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a bizarre loading effect, but okay.
[16:11:45] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered your server is returning an object.
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to return an array.
[16:11:54] <themaninthered> i get you ...
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> and Object.keys() isn't supported in ie8 if that matters.
[16:12:11] <themaninthered> yeah it matters..
[16:12:26] <phpcoder> guys i do $("#bl").html(content) the problem is that the content should replace the <div id="bl"..> too
[16:12:38] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder use .replaceWith()
[16:12:41] <phpcoder> how can i replace it instead of adding inside that div
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered then you need ES5 shim or use an array.
[16:12:48] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, THANK YOU! :)
[16:13:09] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder a quick google search for "jquery replace element" wouild have given you tht answer ;)
[16:13:21] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, yes pardon!
[16:15:12] <themaninthered> the server use php to Json_encode a php array
[16:15:19] <themaninthered> so it is returning a json array.
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> themaninthered obviously it's not sending an array.
[16:15:29] <themaninthered> i feel like the object i'm getting back is a jQuery object.
[16:15:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:15:38] <themaninthered> it's huge.. filled with all sorts of functions.
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> uh..
[16:15:45] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're doing?
[16:16:58] <themaninthered> i'm wrong.. it's not the query object.
[16:17:02] <robertmaxrees> i was abou to say.
[16:17:03] <themaninthered> but it certain is an object.
[16:17:09] <robertmaxrees> but not an array.
[16:17:20] <robertmaxrees> PHP associative arrays are different from javascript arrays.
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> so i'm going to guess that you're using an associative array on the php side and expecting that to magically be an array on the JSON side.
[16:19:04] <themaninthered> yeah that's the case.
[16:19:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, totally different.
[16:19:26] <robertmaxrees> an associative array in JSON is just an object.
[16:19:37] <themaninthered> got it.. but that's really ok to me.
[16:19:47] <robertmaxrees> except you're enumerating over that object.
[16:19:50] <themaninthered> just there should be a way to get the number of keys in an array
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> which is a really inefficient way to do things.
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't have an array.
[16:20:01] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[16:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you have a plain object.
[16:20:09] <themaninthered> it's fine for what i'm going.. (i meant in an object.)
[16:20:26] <robertmaxrees> if you're enumerating, you really want an array lol.
[16:20:50] <themaninthered> i would agree if there were an easy enough way to make the php array output as a json array.
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> errr, you're munging things.
[16:21:53] <robertmaxrees> if the data is intended to be consumed by JS, then you really should transform it to be the right format.
[16:23:37] <themaninthered> so you cannot have an associative array in javascript
[16:23:45] <robertmaxrees> not in the way you're thinking, no.
[16:24:09] <robertmaxrees> objects are similar, but distinct in concept.
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> for instance, they don't have a length.
[16:24:20] <themaninthered> I have to stay with the object or else it won't work.. i need the key to be the id of the item.
[16:24:28] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:24:35] <robertmaxrees> you could do an array of objects.
[16:24:53] <robertmaxrees> if you need a unique ID you can access by, that lets you reduce/filter/map/etc
[16:25:23] <themaninthered> i'm going to have to figure out a way to do it using the object.. i know what i'm up against.. i can get it to work as expected. i need to be able to easily get the value from the key..
[16:25:40] <themaninthered> don't want to have to loop thru anything looking for the value of 4
[16:25:49] <themaninthered> i want to just say item[4].id
[16:26:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to loop.
[16:26:41] <robertmaxrees> you can (and should) use things like filter instead.
[16:28:00] <themaninthered> thanks for your help
[16:28:11] <themaninthered> i must go now.. another meeting awaits
[16:28:11] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[16:28:21] <themaninthered> you put me in the right track.
[16:28:24] <themaninthered> that's what i needed
[16:28:33] <themaninthered> thanks
[16:33:05] <steeze> so i've got an issue with trying to fadeOut > replaceWith > fadeIn. i tried recreating my issue with js-fiddle, but it works as intended.
[16:33:10] <steeze> http://jsfiddle.net/577Lce0c/ here's my code
[16:34:09] <steeze> however, when trying to use this on my site, only certain elements within the main element will fadeout/in but not the entire element
[16:34:34] <robertmaxrees> holy woah.
[16:35:13] <robertmaxrees> hey what's with the unsavory language?
[16:35:19] <robertmaxrees> some folks are at work.
[16:35:32] <steeze> the f word was my doing, the shit part is actually for hte client
[16:35:35] <steeze> it's a bs detector
[16:35:39] <steeze> ill edit. one moment
[16:35:44] <robertmaxrees> thanks ;)
[16:36:04] <steeze> http://jsfiddle.net/577Lce0c/1/ :)
[16:37:05] <steeze> so yeah it works as intended here. my site's code is a bit more complex, it has some images in there on each side of the text. the images will fadeout/fadein, but the (title + title icon) and the description body wll never appear
[16:37:51] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it broken it's hard to help.
[16:38:39] <robertmaxrees> like, the selectors could be bad.
[16:39:01] <steeze> well so the bs-vine-left and bs-vine-right fadein/out
[16:39:05] <steeze> so it's not my selectors
[16:39:17] <steeze> it's just the bs-vine-text part
[16:39:26] <robertmaxrees> which works here?
[16:39:32] <steeze> yeah
[16:39:35] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[16:39:44] <robertmaxrees> that proves it's not selectors how?
[16:40:00] <robertmaxrees> of course it works here - you re-wrote the selectors.
[16:40:30] <steeze> no i copy/pasted it
[16:40:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[16:40:40] <steeze> oh and, i can see my elements in the inspector
[16:40:41] <steeze> but not on the page
[16:40:55] <steeze> messed with div heights, visibility, overflows, font-colors
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> without seein it broken, not sure what you're expecting.
[16:41:18] <steeze> yeah i knew that'd be the case. thought someone might know some weird issues with replace with or fadeout or something
[16:41:37] <StevePRGM> someone can help? i try to make it say "hi!" -- https://jsfiddle.net/0s7y6w8p/1/
[16:41:43] <robertmaxrees> i mean, fadein and fadeout are async, but unless you're like selecting and storing that in a var and using that instead, dunno.
[16:42:01] <steeze> can i pm you?
[16:42:06] <robertmaxrees> please don't :)
[16:42:10] <steeze> okay
[16:42:10] <StevePRGM> yes
[16:42:30] <steeze> not to ask a question robertmaxrees but to show you my site
[16:42:33] <robertmaxrees> StevePRGM use jsfiddle correctly for starters: https://jsfiddle.net/0s7y6w8p/2/
[16:42:33] <steeze> nvm though
[16:42:48] <robertmaxrees> steeze even then - if you can PM it to me, you can share it to the channel ;)
[16:42:55] <robertmaxrees> StevePRGM and .val is a method.
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/val/ look at the examples.
[16:43:10] <StevePRGM> omg it worked
[16:43:14] <StevePRGM> ok.
[16:43:29] <robertmaxrees> though you'd never want to do that in real life.
[16:43:32] <steeze> it's a client site. didn't want to post it publicly. i trust you more for taking the original time to help me, but it's okay
[16:44:12] <robertmaxrees> steeze i could have my irc logs public, so there's no "trust" or "privacy".  also, pming people circumvents the point of the channel.
[16:44:25] <StevePRGM> how do i set that element only using id?
[16:44:26] <steeze> good points
[16:44:43] <robertmaxrees> StevePRGM if you're setting it by default, do that in your html instead.
[16:45:21] <StevePRGM> yes, i was going to do debugging using some text changes for notifications
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> use the debugger instead.
[16:45:32] <robertmaxrees> console.log() and all that.
[16:45:43] <StevePRGM> where does it output?..
[16:45:44] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good read.
[16:46:16] <robertmaxrees> that link will change the way you develop forever.  your browser has a bunch of features you've never used.
[16:46:34] <StevePRGM> ok thanks
[16:46:37] <StevePRGM> i'll be back after :)
[16:47:13] <taplar> ugh, robertmaxrees if i could i'd send you some of this rain...
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> we'd gladly take it.
[16:47:30] <robertmaxrees> we just had a decent amount recently.
[16:47:46] <taplar> we're under some flash flood warnings and other stuff currently
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> oh woah.
[16:47:55] <steeze> taplar midwest?
[16:47:59] <taplar> yup
[16:48:03] <steeze> heard that
[16:48:38] <taplar> arkansas.  how to make drivers act crazy?  just add water.  in any form
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> california, too.
[16:49:17] <robertmaxrees> it's been so long since we've seen water that we think reality has somehow broken.
[16:49:39] <taplar> lol, like it's gotten so hot it must be a mirage
[16:50:02] <taplar> ohhhh.  noooo!!!    waaaaater....  don't trust it steve!!!
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> speaking of heat, so glad we're getting into winter.
[16:52:12] <StevePRGM> "set a breakpoint" <--- jaw dropper
[16:52:14] <StevePRGM> x)
[16:52:21] <robertmaxrees> StevePRGM :) told you.
[16:52:40] <taplar> don't trust it steve!!!
[16:52:44] <taplar> man, i love call backs
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> StevePRGM welcome to like 2006
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> taplar for jobs or code?
[16:53:59] <taplar> lol, ignore me
[16:54:22] <taplar> but. both.
[17:28:13] <guideX> two ajax requests at the same time, why isn't it working?
[17:28:26] <guideX> possibly, because the server is too busy processing the first request?
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> it should work.
[17:30:36] <robertmaxrees> what does your network tab tell you?
[17:31:22] <guideX> hmm one sec, let me get an update of that..
[17:32:01] <guideX> so, it seems like all the requests are pendingt
[17:32:03] <guideX> pending
[17:32:13] <guideX> it's pending the bigger one
[17:32:32] <guideX> all of the , percent complete $.ajax calls
[17:33:03] <guideX> then at the end of the lengthy one, all the little ones complete in sequence, like it's blocking
[17:33:17] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your server to me.
[17:33:33] <guideX> hmm possibly
[17:33:36] <guideX> ok thanks
[17:46:25] <phpcoder> guys i am understanding that my code isn't really DRY...i would like to organize it better (with module etc) to separate the jobs
[17:46:34] <phpcoder> i read good things about backbone.js
[17:46:38] <phpcoder> is a good tool ?
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> it's one way to approach that problem.
[17:46:57] <robertmaxrees> but you likely don't need it.
[17:47:17] <robertmaxrees> it's possible that your code could be DRY with a few tweaks.
[17:48:01] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, looking at my code seems a "spaghetti" code... i mean...  pure js ... with jquery inside etc etc... i need to organize it better
[17:48:19] <robertmaxrees> using backbone doesn't automatically give you that.
[17:48:40] <robertmaxrees> you can easily have the same problems with it.
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[17:50:28] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fef40f5ed87603c1b178     i do not know...it works but sounds hard to maintain and it is not dry... yeah it is not too long....but if i add more things inside this file it will be surelly unmantanable
[17:50:38] <phpcoder> *unmaintainable
[17:51:25] <robertmaxrees> so i'm going to guess it's largely the document ready that you're looking at, right?
[17:52:20] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, yeah it is the "base" then i need to add other things
[17:52:32] <robertmaxrees> that's really easy to fix.
[17:53:05] <phpcoder> as i told you it works....but in this moment i am starting the project so i would like to follow the "best" way to organize it better
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm going to help you do that.
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> so pay attention :)
[17:53:28] <robertmaxrees> because you're making this too hard on yourself.
[17:54:21] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, ok thank you so much! i will follow you!
[17:55:58] <robertmaxrees> first off, does selectize emit jquery events?
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> or no?
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it.
[17:56:59] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[17:57:08] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/events.md
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> already read that
[17:57:17] <phpcoder> "Selectize instances have a basic event emitter interface that mimics jQuery, Backbone.js, et al:"
[17:57:19] <robertmaxrees> all the elements you're binding to - give them a shared class.
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> then you can initiaize all of them in two lines.
[18:00:55] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, do you mean a shared class that has the "change" event inside?
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> i mean an html/css class.
[18:02:11] <phpcoder> yes all the selectize has .selectize class too
[18:02:23] <robertmaxrees> so all of those html elements have a selectize class one them?
[18:03:14] <phpcoder> yes
[18:03:43] <robertmaxrees> then just instantiate selectize on that selector.
[18:03:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of each ID separately.
[18:03:52] <phpcoder> i do that
[18:03:58] <robertmaxrees> not in the code you showed me.
[18:04:03] <phpcoder> i do $(elem).selectize(options);
[18:04:15] <robertmaxrees> right, for each ID.
[18:04:19] <phpcoder> where elem is the item (inside the loop)
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> do it on the single class.
[18:04:27] <phpcoder> basically i loop on all .selectize element
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> there is no loop in the code you showed me.
[18:04:38] <robertmaxrees> then your gist is not the same as your code.
[18:04:39] <phpcoder> yes it is another file
[18:04:51] <robertmaxrees> you reinitialize in this filde...
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> *file...
[18:05:02] <phpcoder> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ab585a492564860b9240
[18:05:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:05:43] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you'r way overcomplicating this...
[18:05:56] <phpcoder> i did some change to selectize
[18:05:59] <phpcoder> yes i think the asme
[18:06:01] <phpcoder> same
[18:06:47] <phpcoder> i would like a tool that has conventions so i must follow them, indeed
[18:07:13] <robertmaxrees> except that backbone won't fix the organizational issues you're having.
[18:07:51] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/b156c1961b79 this is a stop closer.
[18:08:17] <robertmaxrees> those events look like they bubble.
[18:09:25] <robertmaxrees> woops that should be $('.someParent').on('change item_add item_remove', updateForm);
[18:09:40] <robertmaxrees> that'll take care of like 90% of what you were trying to do.
[18:15:28] <blindMoe> Anyone ran into an issue when trying to get .outerWidth() of an element that is absolutely positioned off screen?  It seems like it just returns the parent's width and the width of the element I am checking
[18:15:38] <blindMoe> Seems like it only does it in webkit browsers als
[18:16:52] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, let me check
[18:17:12] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, ok but...what is the application will be more complex and big?
[18:17:19] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder huh?
[18:17:55] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i mean...it works...ok, but if the application will be bigger...are you sure a module system is not a good idea?
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder i never said that isn't a good idea, but your page isn't really complex enough to warrant an entire other framework.
[18:18:48] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, yes for now it is small
[18:18:57] <robertmaxrees> so solve for the features you currently want/need.
[18:19:10] <robertmaxrees> if you need to refactor later, that's fine.
[18:20:35] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, then the problem is that i do other things inside one of selectize object .....for example here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fef40f5ed87603c1b178#file-test-js-L87-L88
[18:20:45] <phpcoder> ok
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> you can handle those as special cases then.
[18:22:08] <phpcoder> ok
[18:23:43] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, sometimes i think/look too much at the future :D
[18:27:15] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, should i no add the .on method on allSelectizeInstances ? (https://bpaste.net/show/b156c1961b79 )
[18:27:26] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead imo.
[18:27:37] <phpcoder> can i use jquery event for selectize?
[18:27:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:27:50] <phpcoder> let me see what use event delegation means :D
[18:27:56] <phpcoder> https://bpaste.net/show/b156c1961b79
[18:27:59] <phpcoder> (line 80)
[18:28:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery's .on() will work here it looks like.
[18:28:19] <phpcoder> yes but before iwrote selectizeInstance.on
[18:28:34] <phpcoder> not related to a jquery element
[18:28:49] <robertmaxrees> right, and i tested earlier that it should work.
[18:28:55] <robertmaxrees> withjquery events.
[18:29:44] <phpcoder> good!
[18:30:06] <robertmaxrees> so a delegated listener would be cleaner here.
[18:30:21] <phpcoder> so maybe 68/69 are not used here i can remove it
[18:30:26] <phpcoder> could u give me an example please?
[18:30:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:30:44] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[18:32:20] <phpcoder> ok
[18:33:18] <asidjazz> READ THE URL says robertmaxrees
[18:33:24] <asidjazz> RTFURL
[18:33:26] <robertmaxrees> pretty much
[18:33:29] <asidjazz> BAM
[18:33:57] <phpcoder> :D
[18:34:27] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, however i am reading that selectize events are called with specific arguments
[18:34:41] <phpcoder> if you put all events like 'change item_add item_remove'
[18:34:41] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder you likely don't need them in this case.
[18:34:57] <robertmaxrees> if you need to make exceptions, then handle them separately.
[18:35:01] <phpcoder> i have to listen to them to call updateContent() callback
[18:35:23] <noahmg123> Can I tell jquery to only use a section of the dom (i.e. everything after a certain point?)
[18:35:34] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder did you notice that my code already does that?
[18:35:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:35:58] <phpcoder> $('.someParent').on('change, item_add, item_remove', updateForm); ??
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder no commas.
[18:36:13] <robertmaxrees> but that should work.
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 "after" or "inside an element"?
[18:36:47] <phpcoder> yes i meant that ... the problem is that change event has a "value" arguements....... item_remove and item_add have two arguemnts
[18:36:49] <phpcoder> ok
[18:37:09] <robertmaxrees> php check out the event object and see if it's in there.
[18:37:09] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: after.
[18:37:21] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 not sure about after.
[18:37:37] <robertmaxrees> "inside" is easy.
[18:37:40] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah, inside is pretty simple.
[18:37:51] <robertmaxrees> why do you need *after*
[18:38:21] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: because the html I am working with is not formed together in a js friendly way.
[18:39:10] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have a $.each loop. Before that loop, I define a variable called image_src. However, when I'm inside the each, I can't access the image_src variable, why is this?
[18:39:22] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut dunno i'd need to seeit.
[18:39:34] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 still not grokking but okay :)
[18:39:59] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: grokking?
[18:40:13] <noahmg123> Nevermind. Thanks google
[18:40:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:40:27] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, with this trick i have removed many lines https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0a69a55f8c224cac3bfa !!!
[18:40:41] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder that's another way, yeah.
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> though you never did read that article on delegation.
[18:41:49] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: basically the code is not written in a way that it is easy to use relevant jQuery on. Hmmmm... I guess I can just remove the unneeded elements.
[18:42:26] <robertmaxrees> "easy to use relevant jQuery on"?
[18:42:37] <robertmaxrees> ooooh reread that.
[18:42:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like non-semantic markup.
[18:42:47] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, it works perfectly except https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0a69a55f8c224cac3bfa#file-aaa-js-L4  "this" is referredto the selectize instance...i do not have that instance so in this case i have to create a var with it
[18:42:54] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: Yeah. there we go.
[18:43:05] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[18:43:06] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: well, it is semantic, just not in the sematics I need.
[18:43:18] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder https://bpaste.net/show/eb4b752651d8 use this.
[18:43:26] <robertmaxrees> and you can access the selectize insteand directly.
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> or at least should be able to .
[18:43:32] <robertmaxrees> not sure.
[18:44:05] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: well, it wasn't really written with my semantics in mind so I can't exactly blame them.
[18:44:28] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 eh, there are basic practices that you should generally follow that covere these kinds of things.
[18:44:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like there's a natural grouping taxonomy that should have taken place.
[18:45:02] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, it works except the line with this.removeOption(value);  it want the instance ofselectize i think
[18:45:05] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah. their semantics are still bad even for their purposes.
[18:45:31] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder yeah, you might need to shuffle through the instances, but that should be too bad.
[18:46:18] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: it's actually some HTML from an ebook. I am trying to extract sections, but the html is wrapped semi-arbitrarily around paragraphs, sometimes even spitting sentences. :P
[18:46:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaah. that explains part of it.
[18:46:33] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, why bad? i think it is the only solution
[18:46:44] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder *shouldn't, sorry
[18:46:56] <phpcoder> ok
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 aaaah that explains it.  i might find some criteria to get the index of the element and then filter out things with an index greater than that one?
[18:47:57] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah... that's what I've been doing. As far a splitting the dom goes, I guess I am just gonna delete to unneeded elements.
[18:48:22] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 i might just .filter() and .map() as needed.
[18:50:08] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, for some reason $search.on('item_remove', '#zipcode-id', function(value) { ... }      is not called when i remove the item
[18:50:21] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: hmmm... I'll take a look. I was using for loops with indexOf and substring, but I will try it.
[18:50:34] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 don't use for loops with jquery basically ever.
[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder was it working before?
[18:50:48] <phpcoder> yes
[18:50:52] <robertmaxrees> WAT
[18:50:53] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ah... what should I use then?
[18:51:00] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 .each()
[18:51:05] <robertmaxrees> .map(), .filter() etc.
[18:51:06] <phpcoder> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fef40f5ed87603c1b178#file-test-js-L80-L91        this worked before
[18:51:07] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ahhh..
[18:51:18] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder that's not what i was referencing.
[18:51:32] <robertmaxrees> $('#search #zipcode-id').on('item_remove', function(value){ this.
[18:51:45] <phpcoder> oh let me re-check again
[18:52:19] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: can I use a while statment with each?
[18:52:21] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, no! does not work
[18:52:55] <phpcoder> it is not fired
[18:53:38] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, if i convert it to      zipcodeSelectize[0].selectize.on('item_remove', function(value){        the event is called!
[18:53:49] <phpcoder> so i think i can work with jquery events directly
[18:54:40] <robertmaxrees> *can't
[18:54:48] <phpcoder> yes pardon CAN'T
[18:54:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:54:54] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: can I use a while statment with each?
[18:55:05] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 why would you use while?
[18:55:12] <phpcoder> the problem here is that  $search.on('change item_add item_remove', '.selectize', updateContent);
[18:55:17] <robertmaxrees> while, for, etc are unnecessary.
[18:55:22] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: oh, because I was really using my for loops like while loops.
[18:55:23] <phpcoder> it is called!
[18:55:34] <phpcoder> i think for change event... but the others not
[18:55:36] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 i wouldn't use them like that at all.
[18:55:38] <phpcoder> item_remove and item_add
[18:55:40] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder weird.
[18:56:31] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, ook i got it...
[18:56:34] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK. I have an several sections, and then each section has it's subsections. The number of subsections vary so I was using while to check if they existed.
[18:56:34] <phpcoder> the change event
[18:56:47] <phpcoder> is the jquery event NOT The selectize's "change" event
[18:57:04] <phpcoder> item_remove and item_add are not catch
[18:57:21] <phpcoder> so i must use    .on method WITH selectize instances :/
[18:58:07] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: do you understand what I wrote?
[18:58:12] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> at work ;)
[18:59:46] <phpcoder> uffff it seems that i have to write the .on for EACH instance!
[19:00:01] <robertmaxrees> you could enumerate through them and do it that way.
[19:00:10] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i tried selectizeInstances = $('#search .selectize').selectize();  and      selectizeInstances.on('change item_add item_remove', '.selectize', updateContent);
[19:00:15] <phpcoder> but it does not work
[19:00:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to .each() through the instancez.
[19:00:23] <robertmaxrees> *instances
[19:01:38] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I am still confused?
[19:01:49] <noahmg123> confued.
[19:01:50] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 slow down - still at work ;)
[19:01:52] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, something like  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/68cdc06fa5c683cadaa1
[19:01:55] <noahmg123> ahhh
[19:02:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you are.
[19:02:08] <robertmaxrees> literally no need for looping or while in there.
[19:02:19] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder no.
[19:02:41] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: in where? And how do you suggest I numerate them?
[19:02:53] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 make a fiddle with some example markup.
[19:02:59] <phpcoder> in this way it seems to work.... how can i optimize it  robertmaxrees '
[19:03:00] <phpcoder> ?
[19:03:21] <robertmaxrees> selectizeInstances.forEach(function(currentInstance) { currentInstance.selectize.on('event', updateContent});
[19:03:30] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK.
[19:03:48] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder what you have there doesn't make any sense and theoretically shouldn't work but who knows.
[19:03:49] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, for some reason the author says that we should use [0].selectize
[19:03:53] <phpcoder> let me try your code
[19:04:06] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder my version should do the same thing that [0] does.
[19:04:11] <robertmaxrees> js 101 ;)
[19:04:29] <phpcoder> or really? what [0] means in this case??
[19:04:35] <phpcoder> why the auther said that ?
[19:04:43] <phpcoder> drugs? :D
[19:04:50] <robertmaxrees> i assume the instances are stored in an array.
[19:04:57] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: the ebook is a study bible my friend made btw. I am trying to extract the verses and the highlight colors.
[19:05:08] <robertmaxrees> [0] is accessing the 0th index from that array.
[19:05:25] <Scriptonaut> I have a data attribute on my image like so: <img data-original-title="Beta Agent">. However, I can't change it with the .data() function, is there a special syntax when it has a dash in it?
[19:05:51] <Scriptonaut> when I do change it, it sets a new data attribute original-title on it, but when I inspect element it is stll the old value
[19:05:56] <robertmaxrees> .data('originalTitle')
[19:06:04] <Scriptonaut> thank you :)
[19:06:05] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut and inspecting the element won't ever work for that.
[19:06:14] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I am back. got disconnected.
[19:06:21] <robertmaxrees> .data() is editing a cached version of the element. Scriptonaut
[19:06:26] <robertmaxrees> errm element's data
[19:06:28] <Scriptonaut> ah
[19:06:31] <phpcoder> selectizeInstances.forEach is not a function
[19:06:41] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder hah, then it's a jquery object.  funky.
[19:07:11] <robertmaxrees> selectizeInstances.each(function() { $(this)[0] then
[19:07:43] <Scriptonaut> Hrm, robertmaxrees do you know if there's a way for me to edit that value, rather than the cached value? I want to change a bootstrap tooltip value, but it's not changing, even when I change 'originalTitle'
[19:08:48] <phpcoder> does not work
[19:09:01] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I have the fiddle ready, I used some of the actual code.
[19:10:33] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: are you ready, or busy?
[19:12:06] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut you can edit the .attr()
[19:12:10] <Scriptonaut> ah, I got it to work by doing: myImage.attr("data-original-title", newUserName)
[19:12:14] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder without a fiddle at this point i can't help.
[19:12:14] <Scriptonaut> ah, thanks :)
[19:12:20] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut that makes me sad haha
[19:12:30] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123_ go ahead and share the fiddle into the channel then.
[19:12:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:12:38] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/LogasnrL/
[19:12:49] <robertmaxrees> errr, where's your JS?
[19:13:55] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I don't have much yet. And the stuff I had was using for loops.
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123_ okay, so what are you trying to do here then?
[19:14:20] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: did you see my previous message?
[19:14:35] <robertmaxrees> assume i didn't.
[19:14:49] <robertmaxrees> (no way for me to know which message you're referencing ;) )
[19:15:45] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: OK. I am trying to take each verse and it's highlighted sections and put them into a JavaScript object.
[19:16:10] <robertmaxrees> pardon my ignorance, how are we defining a "verse"?
[19:16:40] <robertmaxrees> ah, prepended with 1:1 etc.
[19:16:41] <robertmaxrees> right?
[19:16:50] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: yeah
[19:17:03] <ashemark> Hi!
[19:19:06] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: so how would I go about doing this without knowing the exact number of verses in each chapter (the first number is the chapter (i.e. chapter:verse (or 1:2 is chapter 1 verse 2)))
[19:19:12] <ashemark> I'm new to promises, and am constructing a Promises.all object from a local db, for which I need to return promises to remove databases from the success function of $.ajax
[19:19:19] <robertmaxrees> by using .filter(), noahmg123_ :)
[19:19:32] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I will take a look.
[19:19:41] <robertmaxrees> and seeing if the first 3 characters are number, colon, number
[19:20:11] <ashemark> I mean I query a database, for all it's object, construct the Promises.all object with the response returned from an ajax call to a server, and finally return that object
[19:20:25] <robertmaxrees> ashemark make a fiddle.
[19:20:32] <ashemark> ok
[19:21:21] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: can you write a quick example script?
[19:21:29] <robertmaxrees> what part are you lost with :)
[19:21:53] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: seperating out the verses with filter.
[19:22:03] <robertmaxrees> right, break that problem down :)
[19:22:14] <robertmaxrees> you can do $('p').
[19:22:23] <robertmaxrees> now you have all p tags.
[19:22:37] <noahmg123_> ok
[19:22:42] <robertmaxrees> heck you could do $('.Basic-Paragraph.ParaOverride-9') if you want more specificity.
[19:22:48] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[19:22:59] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: ok... got it.
[19:24:30] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I have never used .filter so I may need some help.
[19:27:39] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: I do need help. I still don't see how this will help keep the code from searching for a nonexistent verse (such as 1:31)
[19:29:43] <robertmaxrees> show me the code you have now.
[19:30:15] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: right now... really only $('.Basic-Paragraph.ParaOverride-9').filter(':contains("1:1")')
[19:30:27] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:30:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:30:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:30:31] <noahmg123_> I still don't see how this can be accomplished without a loop.
[19:30:50] <robertmaxrees> you just want the text for each verse, right?
[19:31:09] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: yeah
[19:31:24] <noahmg123_> for now
[19:31:27] <robertmaxrees> so you could .map() that into an array.
[19:31:32] <robertmaxrees> you might not need filter at all.
[19:31:55] <noahmg123_> robert, ok, but would I need to know the number of verses?
[19:31:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:32:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/LogasnrL/2/
[19:33:59] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: OK, but some array entries include multiple verses.
[19:34:04] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: promises problem here :http://jsfiddle.net/m2Lmw42b/
[19:34:28] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123_ you could further split those based on the verse markers and make a new array using .forEach() if you wanted.
[19:34:30] <ashemark> i'm using pouchdb to get all the docs seen as rows here, which returns a promise..
[19:34:46] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: ok
[19:34:55] <robertmaxrees> ashemark that's not even valid js.
[19:35:06] <ashemark> i know, there's a lot more
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:35:15] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: do you mean each()?
[19:35:24] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123_ .forEach() on allVerses
[19:35:28] <robertmaxrees> it's now an array.
[19:35:38] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: ahhh
[19:36:20] <robertmaxrees> ashemark i'm lost then
[19:36:27] <robertmaxrees> and the fiddle didn't help much :)
[19:36:47] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're not using jqueuery promises.
[19:37:02] <ashemark> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/m2Lmw42b/1/
[19:37:06] <robertmaxrees> *jquery - if you're using native, go to ##javascript.
[19:37:45] <ashemark> i want a promise friendly version of $.ajax..
[19:37:58] <robertmaxrees> ashemark jquery has it's own promises implementation.
[19:38:07] <ashemark> umm ok
[19:38:10] <robertmaxrees> currently not spec compliant, but most of what you need is in there.
[19:38:19] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() returns thenable objects.
[19:38:33] <robertmaxrees> but you need to juggle it all through jquery's interface for it.
[19:38:44] <ashemark> ?
[19:39:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to use jquery's methods.
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> not the native ES promises.
[19:39:24] <ashemark> hmm
[19:40:31] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, it works!!! https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e05292783c6dab1ea3a1    could i write it better ??   unfortunately "change item_add item_remove" does not work...i must write the event separatly
[19:42:12] <robertmaxrees> option[value='" + String(value) + "']") just use value
[19:42:18] <robertmaxrees> no need for the whole constructor there.
[19:43:39] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, insteaf of String(value) ?
[19:43:43] <robertmaxrees> just value
[19:43:51] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/20af6cfc0f37
[19:44:06] <robertmaxrees> tweaked the $selectizeInstances.each(function() { call, too.
[19:45:05] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/4d740bf7bfc8 with the string value change
[19:45:07] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, the past is the same as mine ?
[19:45:10] <phpcoder> i see
[19:45:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:45:16] <robertmaxrees> i fixed a few things.
[19:47:05] <noahmg123_> robertmaxrees: OK, I think I have got something working, I am splitting the innerText with a regular expresion.
[19:47:24] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, perfect works
[19:47:28] <phpcoder> thank you so much!
[19:48:27] <LindsayM_> What is the proper method for returning an ajax call that was successful (run without errors) but returned no results for the query?
[19:49:43] <robertmaxrees> LindsayM_ .done()?
[19:51:08] <robertmaxrees> LindsayM_ (not sure what you mean)
[19:52:00] <LindsayM_> robertmaxrees: so my JS returns success: success when a query was completed successfully regardless of whether or not it has data.. I am curious if there are headers or anything that has to be returned as well
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> LindsayM_ is the ajax call posting data?
[19:52:40] <LindsayM_> No
[19:52:52] <robertmaxrees> so it's simply that "no results" is a valid response?
[19:52:53] <LindsayM_> Its running a search and getting the results back from it
[19:53:12] <LindsayM_> yea, but are there proper headers to be returned for a "no results" type of response?
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> nope. the response body should be an empty array.
[19:53:54] <LindsayM_> Ok.. well it returns success: success and that is all..
[19:54:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd refactor so the results are returned in an array and then go from there.
[19:54:33] <LindsayM_> basically WordPress wasnts to return as JSON
[19:55:33] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what i just said lol
[19:55:39] <robertmaxrees> but you mean it's returning a preformatted object?
[19:56:08] <LindsayM_> youi said results returned in an array. they will never be returned in an array. They're returned as a JSON string.
[19:56:08] <LindsayM_> yes
[19:56:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, contractually that would make the most sense.
[19:56:30] <LindsayM_> I mean I can easily return a flag like success: no-results
[19:56:38] <robertmaxrees> eh, that's weird.
[19:56:42] <LindsayM_> I just wanted to make sure that that is the proper way
[19:57:21] <robertmaxrees> you're already out of the "proper way" so i'd just rely on the existence of something on the object.
[19:57:52] <LindsayM_> What is the  "proper way" though? returning an array and parseJSON in the js?
[19:58:16] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to parse, but yeah.  or return an object with a results property that is an array.
[19:58:37] <robertmaxrees> depending on a variety of factors
[19:58:41] <LindsayM_> yea WP has this wp_send_json() function you have to use
[19:58:56] <robertmaxrees> of course they force quotes around the response.
[19:59:53] <LindsayM_> ya
[19:59:59] <robertmaxrees> turrible.
[20:00:24] <LindsayM_> i know... i figure I wanted to make sure I was doing it the "best" way I can within the confines
[20:00:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[20:01:52] <LindsayM_> thanks.. tinme for me to head on home...
[20:57:29] <gkwhc> hi, anyone have experience with blue imp's file uploader? im trying to figure out how to catch an error message passed to it from server side php
[21:11:29] <Tagor> How can I wrap the contents of a div with another div? So for example  <div id="test"> <p>test1</p> <p>test2</p> </div>  should become:  <div id="test"> <div>  <p>test1</p> <p>test2</p> </div> </div>
[21:20:07] <jak2000> hi all
[23:09:48] <deitarion> I have a $(document).ready() which only works properly if I comment out my iframe because, with the iframe present, it fires only within the iframe. Advice?
[23:13:42] <deitarion> Never mind. Just figured it out. I'd written <iframe ... /> rather than <iframe ...></iframe>
[23:45:46] <Ou42> any JQM gurus here?
[23:46:03] <Ou42> in JQM I get that it fills the width of the viewport.
[23:46:19] <Ou42> bu there are times where I'd like things "inline" but not the way they do it...
[23:46:44] <Ou42> So, specifically, in JQM if we use a checkbox, it actually has a checkbox and it takes the full width of the viewport.
[23:47:24] <Ou42> if we inline it via a fieldset: <fieldset data-role="controlgroup" data-type="horizontal">
[23:47:44] <Ou42> they become buttons that light when they are checked.. but no longer have the checkbox.
[23:49:25] <Ou42> in, JQM, is there no "simple" way to get the checkbox back to display on a checkbox input element when displayed horizontally?
[23:50:16] <Ou42> ( and by horizontally, i mean multiple elements on the same "line" )
[23:54:35] <Ou42> y'all aren't in PST, eh?
[23:54:52] <Ou42> sleep is for sissies
