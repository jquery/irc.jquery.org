[00:08:25] <k_sze[work]> Is there a way to create two instances of the same version of jQuery object without loading in the js file a second time?
[00:08:58] <Cork> k_sze[work]: why would you need tow instances?
[00:12:33] <k_sze[work]> Cork: a little hard to explain. We have some code that our client can include on their website. Our code usually relies on jQuery 1.7.1+. If my client's website happens to have a recent enough version of jQuery, and if there is a way to clone the jQuery object, then we probably don't need to load in our 1.7.1 version, you see what I'm trying to do?
[00:13:07] <k_sze[work]> We don't want to contaminate the jQuery object that *may* be already defined on our client's website.
[00:13:22] <Cork> k_sze[work]: yes, and i would argue you shouldn't
[00:13:41] <Cork> you should add a "requirements" for the plugin instead
[00:14:09] <Cork> you can load multiple versions of jquery on the same page, but it WILL cause a bunch of pain
[00:14:18] <Cork> and it will slow down the page
[00:14:21] <k_sze[work]> Right now we are bundling jQuery 1.7.1 and using noConflict so we don't change the client's own instance of jQuery.
[00:14:28] <Cork> so i strongly recommend to NOT do that
[00:14:47] <Cork> k_sze[work]: ya, and that is the way you shouldn't do it
[00:15:09] <jax> morning
[00:15:40] <Cork> k_sze[work]: you can give them an example that relies on existing jquery and one for pages with no framework
[00:15:56] <Cork> k_sze[work]: and then let the site developer decide how to handle it
[00:16:18] <Cork> forcing additional frameworks down there throat is not a good solution
[00:17:02] <Cork> k_sze[work]: if you really want to isolate the plugin, give them a small script that injects an iframe and to your stuff from there instead
[00:17:22] <Cork> then you won't have to care about the hosting page at all
[00:23:56] <krenner> Hi, i have buttons positioned absolutely but i get 0 from  .position().left / right
[00:24:13] <krenner> what is strange it is working on half of site...
[00:24:49] <Cork> krenner: make sure the element is not display:none and that it is added to the document dom
[00:26:20] <tobago> jphase, do you know how to set an inital value for the mask?
[00:26:35] <tobago> I mean an inital value for the input to be masked.
[00:26:51] <jphase> tobago: I typically just use html5 placeholders for that
[00:27:13] <krenner> i have no idea how. It isn't display:none, i'm sure. It's in index.html
[00:28:02] <Cork> krenner: could you try recreating it in jsfiddle.net ?
[00:28:26] <krenner> right, i will do it
[00:30:08] <jwaltz> I'm doing some simple scraping and want data from sub-elements of a repeated element. i'm using .each() to save the data to an array but after the .each() my array is filled with the very last piece of data instead of 1 of each. any advice?
[00:30:38] <jwaltz> I swear it was working a couple hours ago
[00:32:43] <jwaltz> I'm experiencing the problem server-side with Cheerio for node.js
[00:35:43] <tobago> jphase, mmh. Even if I set the initial date value (today) into the placeholder, the Masked Input plugin, shows "32.12.5920" which is obviously not today.
[00:36:23] <jphase> hmm, sounds odd
[00:36:34] <tobago> There is gap betwenn the placeholder value and the shown value
[00:36:40] <tobago> true
[00:38:10] <tobago> jphase, my JS: https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6696299
[00:39:10] <jphase> tobago: the .mask call should be outside of that event
[00:39:13] <jphase> on doc ready
[00:39:19] <jphase> not sure if that has something to do with it?
[00:40:01] <krenner> Cork: i have almost the same: http://jsfiddle.net/caqed/  but on jsfiddle it works. I need to rewrite it probably...
[00:41:31] <tobago> jphase, but outside the delegate, it will never mask any input, beeing inserted by AJAX.
[00:41:41] <jphase> ohhh
[00:41:46] <jphase> delegate, right
[00:43:07] <jphase> hmm, can you screenshot it or something?
[00:43:16] <jphase> mask is overlapping placeholder you say?
[00:50:24] <jax> looking for a configurable jquery gauge to display temperature
[00:51:22] <jwaltz> is there a way to screw up this example: https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio#each-functionindex-element- such that the array contains copies of the last element instead of distinct elements?
[00:51:31] <jwaltz> because that is the problem i am experiencing
[00:52:14] <prasanthg> Hello. I'm trying to get the toogle div from right to left on button click or auto toggle at a specified time and the code if http://pastebin.com/GieX0BhV
[00:52:37] <prasanthg> can i know what is wrong with the code? it is showing the button but toggle effect isn't working
[00:53:02] <krenner> Cork: i have copied this code from jsfiddle to my project and it isn't working.  I'm executing this js fragment in $(document).ready maybe here is problem? button positions are set in css
[00:53:31] <Cork> krenner: check so you run the code in head on jsfiddle (not onload)
[00:55:32] <krenner> Cork: in jsfiddle works. in all combinations
[00:56:13] <sourav> hi
[00:56:54] <krenner> Cork: can i send you truncated version of my project with this problem?
[00:57:19] <prasanthg> are the jquery events dependent on the jquery and jquery ui file versions?
[00:58:18] <jphase> prasanthg: there are different functions and event aliases but most of the events are generally the same
[00:58:34] <jphase> depends on how far back the versions you're talking about are
[00:59:22] <prasanthg> Ok. http://pastebin.com/GieX0BhV the code seems to be fine but it isn't working though i included the supported js and js ui files
[01:00:36] <jphase> prasanthg: you need a doc ready wrapper
[01:01:02] <jwaltz> here is the code i'm having trouble with http://pastebin.com/UrAqQBpa
[01:01:50] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[01:02:01] <jwaltz> hopefully someone in here familiar with Cheerio for node.js can help me out
[01:02:03] <jphase> jwaltz: I'd need to see your markup to help with that most likely
[01:02:10] <jphase> oh Cheerio
[01:02:25] <jwaltz> its not my markup actually, doing some scraping
[01:02:37] <jphase> gotcha
[01:02:49] <jwaltz> www.betonline.com/sportsbook is the markup i'm going over
[01:03:44] <jphase> so this .each is based on the Cheerio scraped content then?
[01:03:47] <jphase> k
[01:04:27] <jwaltz> yep
[01:04:47] <jphase> what's the issue?
[01:05:26] <jwaltz> the array of objects i'm writing to ends up with the same 3 properties over and over, instead of the unique properties i expect
[01:05:31] <prasanthg> thanks alot jphase
[01:05:39] <jphase> np prasanthg
[01:05:45] <prasanthg> \o/
[01:06:15] <jwaltz> and the 3 properties happen to be the final three that .each() goes over
[01:06:20] <jphase> jwaltz: I definitely see that part, what are you trying to select though?
[01:07:13] <jphase> just the text from the last few columns or?
[01:07:24] <jphase> total points?
[01:07:38] <jwaltz> jphase, tr data from tbody elements
[01:07:51] <jwaltz> all of it, eventually
[01:08:01] <jphase> jwaltz: then I'd recommend not using .text
[01:08:12] <jphase> I mean, eventually use it
[01:08:22] <jphase> but loop through each td and then grab text as needed
[01:08:31] <prasanthg> now, how can i toggle group of divs with content automatically or by associated button click
[01:08:35] <jphase> oh wait, nvm
[01:08:41] <jphase> let me read your variable names first heh
[01:09:00] <Acrack> hi
[01:09:14] <imjakechapman> hey guys, is there a way to capture keyboard events in order.. like if someone was to spell out a word not in a textfield? To unlock something that's hidden?
[01:09:18] <jphase> prasanthg: use an attribute that relates the elements together
[01:09:22] <imjakechapman> I know you can do stuff like $(document).keypress("c",function(e) {
[01:09:22] <imjakechapman>   if(e.ctrlKey)
[01:09:22] <imjakechapman>     alert("Ctrl+C was pressed!!");
[01:09:22] <imjakechapman> });
[01:09:34] <imjakechapman> whoops, that wasn't supposed to do that. hah sorry.
[01:10:12] <jphase> imjakechapman: you can create a global array and add on keychars to it, but you'd have to make sure it gets cleaned up when you're done somehow
[01:10:36] <imjakechapman> awesome. Didn't even think about that..
[01:10:37] <imjakechapman> thanks
[01:11:14] <jwaltz> jphase, I expect the .each() to iterate through the matching tr's, and for each of those I want to store the td data but for some reason only the last 3 td data get stored and its in every slot of the array
[01:11:32] <Acrack> anyone using highcharts here ?
[01:12:01] <jphase> jwaltz: you may want to look at this little attribute they add on there:   "evcfg"
[01:12:07] <jphase> looks like it has most of the data you need
[01:12:15] <jphase> Acrack: I'm a highcharts dork
[01:12:25] <jphase> or used to be, been about 6 months
[01:12:26] <Acrack> what dork mean :p ?
[01:12:37] <jphase> it means yes, I use highcharts hehe
[01:12:40] <Acrack> :
[01:12:46] <jphase> I've extended it, done some crazy stuff with it b4
[01:13:08] <Acrack> im doing some graphs also at work mixing different datas etc
[01:13:18] <Acrack> royal pain in da a** xD
[01:13:43] <jphase> jwaltz: you see what I mean by evcfg variable?
[01:13:46] <jphase> er... attribute?
[01:13:47] <jwaltz> jphase I took a look at that when deciding what to select but its missing some stuff
[01:13:57] <jphase> oh okay
[01:14:03] <Acrack> jphase:  im trying to sort datas by month/year
[01:14:24] <jwaltz> and this problem repeats itself for other tr's with other data as I build up the properties of the objects in my array
[01:14:48] <jphase> Acrack: I'd do that on the server side before I hand my data off to highcharts
[01:15:11] <jphase> jwaltz: you'll have to loop through each tr and build on to your array for each row
[01:15:17] <Acrack> jphase: month view works good, but this is what i have when i go to Year view : http://screencast.com/t/Kbg0ijjWeE
[01:15:37] <jphase> jwaltz: your problem now is that .find() is recursive and will not care about the scope of the tr
[01:16:01] <jwaltz> jphase oh .find() is doing me in? dang it
[01:16:22] <jphase> I mean, it works fine, but you need to append onto your array for each tr.event
[01:16:28] <jphase> not for each td
[01:16:40] <jphase> or... tbody.event > tr
[01:16:41] <jphase> sorry
[01:16:52] <krenner> Could someone look here please? http://jsfiddle.net/PUAUu/1/  how to solve an issue which $().position() don't work in jquery-ui tabs?
[01:17:57] <jphase> Acrack: Hmm, I'd probably have to see this in jsfiddle.net to find the issue
[01:18:16] <prasanthg> Can i know how to make the three <p> paragraphs at bottom to toggle right to left automatically or when 3 buttons are clicked. http://pastebin.com/Y24A52UL i'm not clear on how to add attribute for all
[01:18:40] <Acrack> jphase: ok i ll try to reproduce this on fiddle xD
[01:19:10] <jwaltz> jphase i'm confused...am I not doing that now?
[01:20:18] <jwaltz> also before I do any of this scraping my array is initialized with the appropriate number of empty objects: [{}, {}, {}...]
[01:20:52] <jwaltz> which is why the built-in index parameter from .each() is so handy
[01:22:27] <jphase> jwaltz: that's quite explicit of you hehe, don't think you need to initialize empty objects since you can just build them on the fly as needed
[01:22:33] <jphase> but not the problem at hand hehe
[01:23:11] <jphase> let me try to console.log some magic to see if I can get a startTime for you as an example
[01:23:15] <Acrack> jphase: i fixed my problem thanks anyway mate =)
[01:23:33] <Acrack> i had to play with                 tickInterval: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 30
[01:23:35] <Acrack> ^^
[01:23:39] <jwaltz> I guess you're right. my relatively short background is in languages much more strict that JS when it comes to array indexing
[01:23:49] <jphase> prasanthg: $('#myDiv > p').prop('attributename', 'attributevalue');
[01:24:02] <jphase> nice Acrack
[01:24:24] <jphase> was gonna say, could be space between lines, but with only a screenshot hard to tell
[01:24:34] <jphase> you beat me to it :)
[01:33:30] <jphase> jwaltz: try using .children instead of .find
[01:35:38] <jwaltz> jphase no discernable difference to me
[01:35:53] <jphase> jwaltz: when I'm on that site and I inject jQuery on to the page and type this:  $('tr.h2hSeq.firstline > td.col_time.bdevtt').each(function(){ console.log($(this).text().trim()); });
[01:35:59] <jphase> it logs each time 1 at a time
[01:36:16] <jphase> perhaps you could just use that .each with an index as well?
[01:36:29] <jphase> do each value 1 .each at a time, but that seems like a waste of memory
[01:36:44] <jphase> there must be some reason that's happening
[01:36:52] <jwaltz> hmmm
[01:37:06] <jphase> let me steal the source and try to make a script or something
[01:37:26] <jphase> ew, they have blank lines above their doc type
[01:37:35] <jwaltz> its ugly stuff man
[01:40:15] <jwaltz> I copied what you injected and wrote earlier
[01:40:37] <jwaltz> and gave it an index param. and replaced console.log with events[index].startTime = $(this).text().trim();
[01:40:50] <jwaltz> and it still repeats the last startTime in all of my objects in the array
[01:41:17] <jwaltz> i ran the console.log before replacing it and saw that it printed all the correct times
[01:41:39] <jphase> hmm
[01:41:57] <jwaltz> perhaps the problem lies outside of the code we are discussing in my program...i hope not
[01:44:00] <jwaltz> jphase here is the full code http://pastebin.com/RhaykfB8
[01:44:54] <Acrack> jphase: i got my dates in english on the graphs
[01:45:04] <Acrack> anyway to have them in french or smth else ?
[01:45:42] <jphase> Acrack: http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#lang
[01:46:25] <Acrack> thx :p
[01:46:46] <jphase> np
[01:47:37] <guideX> how do I select something where the image is like a certain url
[01:47:44] <guideX> err where the background-image
[01:47:51] <guideX> can't seem to do it
[01:49:38] <jphase> guideX: not really a way to use css from the stylesheet in your selector
[01:50:00] <jphase> you can loop through elements and check their .css('background-image') property but that's about it
[01:50:13] <guideX> hmm I see
[01:50:30] <jphase> I would suggest giving them a class, then setting the background-image css for that class
[01:50:40] <jphase> then you can select them and you have you bg image just fine ;)
[01:50:45] <guideX> basically i'm trying to hide this widgets logo http://dev.team-nexgen.org/content/nexirc
[01:50:55] <guideX> it is being inserted through js somewhere
[01:51:10] <jphase> oh
[01:51:15] <jphase> is it in a style attribute?
[01:51:34] <guideX> yeah the js is inserting all the attributes
[01:51:48] <guideX> I could try and stop it, but the js is compressed, and hard to read
[01:51:51] <jphase> guideX: it's possible to select that then, but it's sort of dirty to do so
[01:51:59] <guideX> hmm true..
[01:52:23] <jphase> $('[style*=background-image:url(blah.png)]') kinda thing
[01:52:46] <jphase> or you could just *= select just the image name in the style attribute too probably
[01:52:58] <jphase> depending on the naming convention of the image
[01:53:08] <jax> what's a good way to update temperature every 500ms ?
[01:53:13] <jax> is there some kind of timer we can use?
[01:53:23] <jphase> jax: setTimeout ?
[01:53:24] <jax> which doesn't spam requests
[01:53:33] <jax> i.e only fires a new one if the last request returned
[01:54:07] <jphase> just declare a function that has a global variable that toggles true/false, and only do your operations if that's true
[01:54:39] <jax> ok
[01:55:18] <fnstudio> Hi! I have a (naive) question on how to select an attribute within my DOM: https://dpaste.de/wwTMa/ Any hints?
[01:56:17] <jwaltz> jphase any last thoughts before I pass out?
[01:56:21] <jphase> fnstudio: okay, go ahead and ask your question then
[01:56:42] <jphase> jwaltz: trying to build an object on this right now
[01:56:45] <fnstudio> jphase: the question is in the snippet i posted, along with the code
[01:57:05] <jwaltz> oh ok
[01:57:50] <jphase> my-input-field[0].prop('data-selectable-type')
[01:59:57] <fnstudio> jphase: thank you very much. however, when i do that, i get "TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'prop'"
[02:00:26] <jphase> fnstudio: you may be using an old version of jQuery?  try .attr
[02:01:15] <fnstudio> jphase: same result
[02:01:23] <_rgn> you don't have a jquery object
[02:01:28] <fnstudio> "has no method attr"
[02:01:29] <jphase> ah wrap $()
[02:01:43] <jphase> $(my-input-field[0])
[02:01:59] <fnstudio> _rgn, jphase: i'll try that
[02:03:31] <jphase> hmm jwaltz:  this seems to work for me http://pastebin.ws/85zd8s
[02:03:48] <jphase> granted, it's all with arrays
[02:03:52] <jphase> but that's cause I was lazy
[02:04:32] <jphase> it logs 1 value per index
[02:06:10] <fnstudio> jphase: _rgn: it's working now, thanks!! $() did the trick
[02:06:28] <jwaltz> jphase is my problem something to do with the array then?
[02:06:45] <jphase> jwaltz: nah, shouldn't be an issue with data type
[02:07:20] <jphase> odd thing is... not much difference in our code outside of that hehe
[02:07:45] <jphase> I use $.trim() instead of.trim() at the end for IE compatibility but that's not the problem either
[02:07:54] <jphase> and .children() insted of .find() but you already tried that as well
[02:08:19] <jwaltz> right, $.trim() doesn't work in cheerio, i have to use the string one
[02:08:41] <jphase> ahh gotcha
[02:09:00] <jphase> I mean, I guess you can try using an array
[02:09:06] <jphase> but there's no need to do that really
[02:09:15] <jwaltz> an array of arrays vs. array of objects?
[02:11:18] <jphase> nah just tested with array of objects and works fine
[02:13:05] <jwaltz> ugh
[02:13:20] <jwaltz> maybe some kind of interaction between Cheerio, Request, and Meteor or something...
[02:13:45] <jphase> hmm, this works for me: http://pastebin.ws/1keh30
[02:13:47] <jwaltz> i already wrapped my entire scraping activity to make it synchronous since meteor is synchronous
[02:14:56] <jphase> perhaps, but I'd think that'd make you unable to retrieve data vs. retrieving data in an unintentionally recursive fashion :\
[02:15:39] <jphase> try the example I pastebin'd
[02:15:43] <jphase> I gotta hit the hay
[02:15:44] <jwaltz> testing your example now
[02:15:54] <jphase> I'll wait for the suspense...
[02:15:55] <jphase> lol
[02:16:23] <jwaltz> it worked!
[02:16:29] <jphase> sweet :)
[02:16:30] <jwaltz> my mind just exploded
[02:17:07] <jwaltz> i'll play with this and see if i can get it to fit together with the other scraping
[02:17:14] <jwaltz> thanks for sticking it out with me jphase, i appreciate it
[02:17:22] <jphase> hehe, np homie
[02:17:29] <jphase> always good to end on a high note
[02:17:33] <jphase> night everyone
[02:17:41] <jphase> er... early morning  rather
[02:24:42] <Radditz> hello
[02:24:52] <Radditz> how can I set the "title" of a button using jquery ?
[02:25:03] <Radditz> <input type="button" value="title" >
[02:26:28] <Acrack> jphase: i got another problem mate :D
[02:31:41] <_rgn> Radditz: do you know how to set the attribute for a element
[02:34:03] <Radditz> _rgn: unfortunately no
[02:34:20] <_rgn> Radditz: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[02:34:36] <_rgn> you should be able to figure out the rest
[02:34:43] <Radditz> I am having trouble working with jquery documentation, there are many shortcuts and often only the full method name is displayed
[02:35:05] <Radditz> for a person that doesn't know the api such as myself I am having trouble finding something I need in the documentation
[02:35:38] <_rgn> that page is pretty straightforward
[02:36:15] <evenicoulddoit> Lo all, does someone know if there's a way to prevent the focus event on a UI Dialog? I want to set a focus manually but due to UI setting it the only way round it I can think of is to set a timeout
[02:36:18] <Radditz> thank you _rgn I will read it and use it
[02:36:32] <Radditz> _rgn: but had I not known the .attr() , how would I have found it in the first place?
[02:36:53] <evenicoulddoit> Radditz: What are you trying to achieve?
[02:37:02] <_rgn> Radditz: knowing that title is an attribute of a element, you can google "jquery set attribute of element"
[02:37:10] <_rgn> that will lead you to attr() almost certainly
[02:37:37] <Radditz> evenicoulddoit: well I have a popup window and I need to set the title of a button depending on the locale, but I need to retrieve it from the parent window where I plan to write it in a variable from java
[02:39:34] <evenicoulddoit> Have you also seen http://stackoverflow.com/questions/87359/can-i-pass-a-javascript-variable-to-another-browser-window?
[02:54:04] <raj> why is `data` not defined in this situation? http://paste.ofcode.org/ZhNVRKPk66QVYiuw2jZNAR
[02:54:55] <Cork> raj: are the callback to updateProfileFields in the same scope as var data?
[02:55:26] <raj> no
[02:55:33] <raj> what I just showed is in a function
[02:55:41] <raj> like, all of that paste is in a function
[02:55:53] <visualshock> How can I get all <li> elements that is inside a <ol>?
[02:55:53] <raj> then in another function at that same level is updateProfileFields
[02:56:00] <Cork> if all that is in one function it would be in the same scope
[02:56:08] <raj> visualshock, $('ol li')
[02:56:35] <raj> Cork, no, it is not all in the same function
[02:56:47] <Cork> raj: then nothing is passing data to the callback function
[02:57:24] <visualshock> raj, $('ol li')?
[02:58:25] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/6qZp8iXetb2YhFZj2TsEGa
[02:59:02] <raj> visualshock, yes
[03:00:09] <visualshock> raj, what does it return, an array?
[03:00:27] <raj> yes
[03:01:34] <raj> Cork, why does data have to be passed? Isn't it in the parent function (processNewJob)?
[03:20:28] <MiKiOnEs> can someone help me with http://pastebin.com/UeDVVwAE its not work sometimes.
[03:21:42] <jop008> Hi indexOf for arrays not workin in IE?
[03:22:32] <xec> jop008: it's new in ie9, and not available in quirks mode iirc
[03:23:03] <jop008> I want to run fine in IE8 also
[03:23:25] <xec> then use a shim. you can find one at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[03:25:12] <jop008> You can add it by ching prototype
[03:25:35] <xec> ching?
[03:25:47] <sahbeewah> or you know, $.inArray
[03:27:32] <sahbeewah> MiKiOnEs, what is .page() meant to do
[03:27:45] <sahbeewah> jqm thing?
[03:27:50] <MiKiOnEs> yes
[03:28:10] <MiKiOnEs> it suppose to reapplay styles on lodaed element
[03:29:21] <MiKiOnEs> it can be that if this function runs in callback from form post it fire in wrong order ?
[03:30:32] <MiKiOnEs> bc when it runs the dom is not replace with new content
[03:32:04] <sahbeewah> i assume that the method is async so you can't just run callback() after that...
[03:32:37] <sahbeewah> $.get(page, function(...) { }).done(callback);
[03:32:43] <sahbeewah> probably what you're after.
[03:33:33] <MiKiOnEs> sahbeewah gona try that thx
[03:37:29] <xec> sahbeewah: that should do basically the same
[03:39:11] <xec> sahbeewah: the function param in .get() is already a .done() callback, so calling it inside that or in its own .done() shouldn't make a difference
[03:39:34] <MiKiOnEs> sahbeewah: is not working :/ when i fire it manualy from console si worlking fine when it runs from http://pastebin.com/USe6Vrp5 it fails
[03:41:37] <sahbeewah> oh right of course, my bad
[03:42:07] <sahbeewah> i meant use a handler off the page method, so quickly skimming through the docs that's probably...
[03:42:38] <sahbeewah> ... .page().on('pagecreate', function(e) { callback(); });
[03:44:30] <wabber> Hello. Is there a way to move (animate) an element to be on top of another element? given that the two elements have different parent elementsâ€¦ I need to transition an element smoothly from one location to another location. However, the animate() method moves the element by adding/subtracting from the current location.
[03:45:30] <xec> wabber: i don't know of any shorcuts, but it should be possible to use some math, measure the difference in their position relative to the window
[03:45:47] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[03:48:05] <MiKiOnEs> sahbeewah: it make sure that callback is fired when page is fully lodaed yes ?
[03:49:53] <MiKiOnEs> sahbeewah: it seams taht pagecreate event is never fired in by .page() method
[03:51:26] <wabber> xec: thank you that did the trick.
[03:53:51] <sahbeewah> uh, just going by the docs... try the option attribute - .page({ 'create': function(e, ui) { callback(); });
[03:58:05] <titii> HI
[03:59:32] <davesleeeep> anyone got a long list of string manipulators
[03:59:35] <davesleeeep> and examples?
[03:59:56] <davesleeeep> annnd i found one lol
[04:00:44] <titii> I have a on click event, to the class element, to slideToggle. There are two blocks of that elements. After these elemenets I have an $(that classes).each(function... $(this).click()...}) to make a slide open by default. But the problem is, only one will open. Why?
[04:02:52] <xec> davesleeeep: what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:02:52] <doug65536> does anyone know if jquery properly handles utf-16 surrogate pairs in ajax submit url-encoding?
[04:03:49] <doug65536> I'm testing my web app and I am getting an error when I put (Ê˜â€¿Ê˜) in my form
[04:04:10] <xec> titii: can you make a demo at jsfiddle.net demonstrating the issue?
[04:04:20] <davesleeeep> current i got a search engine displaying results
[04:04:27] <lxsameer> hi, how can i select all the ".abc" classes except one which is related to "this"
[04:04:29] <davesleeeep> and was trying to think how to make a gallery for it on the fly
[04:04:50] <davesleeeep> then i realised ic ould simply just create an inner div with incrementing values as the page is generater
[04:04:53] <davesleeeep> generated and use that
[04:04:54] <doug65536> lxsameer: $('.blahblah').not($(this))
[04:05:11] <davesleeeep> i got told you can use numeric only values for ID's so i want to strip the letter infront
[04:05:13] <lxsameer> doug65536: thanks
[04:05:17] <davesleeeep> but i found a website to sort it, so it's cool
[04:05:44] <xec> davesleeeep: that's false information :/
[04:05:57] <xec> davesleeeep: oh wait, misread you
[04:06:11] <xec> davesleeeep: you *can* use numeric only (although bad idea)
[04:06:29] <doug65536> davesleeeep: you can use any alphanumeric characters in an id with no trouble
[04:07:06] <doug65536> davesleeeep: . { } [ ] < > + - <space> etc... will cause you difficulties
[04:08:00] <doug65536> lxsameer: to be more clear: .not can take a selector, or a jquery
[04:08:31] <lxsameer> doug65536: thanks man
[04:08:50] <xec> davesleeeep: if you start an ID with a number you can't (as easily) select it with css
[04:09:06] <xec> davesleeeep: http://jsfiddle.net/YkFRU/
[04:10:01] <snorti> any idear why this http://pastebin.com/fi60iFZ9 wont work in ie8?
[04:10:14] <titii> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/x2vtX/ but the javascript to slide it open is after html, like in my code
[04:10:28] <titii> xec: u can see what i want
[04:10:28] <xec> davesleeeep: http://jsfiddle.net/YkFRU/1/
[04:10:43] <xec> davesleeeep: so be sure you actually want to do it first ;)
[04:10:45] <titii> xec: in real, only one slide is opened, dont know why
[04:11:20] <titii> xec: when I give an alert - delay in each, then it works
[04:11:31] <titii> xec: any idea?
[04:12:36] <titii> xec: or u can see it like this
[04:12:38] <titii> http://jsfiddle.net/x2vtX/1/
[04:12:43] <titii> only one is opened
[04:13:28] <xec> titii: what is the expected/wanted result? start out with each open?
[04:13:39] <titii> xec: yes
[04:13:59] <xec> then just don't set display: none; ? http://jsfiddle.net/x2vtX/2/
[04:14:06] <lxsameer> i use javascript to append html to a container, but my event handlers did not apply to new elements
[04:14:21] <titii> xec: i know, i can do it with css, but, i would make it with jquery, it should works, no?
[04:16:03] <xec> titii: isn't it a lot easier to just start out with the state you want to start out with? and then you can start cleaning up the toggle method, instead of .attr("class") === .... you can use .hasClass("exp-bg") for instance
[04:16:33] <xec> and why do you select all ":animated" ?
[04:16:47] <xec> that's why you
[04:16:53] <xec> 're only getting one i bet
[04:18:24] <titii> xec: hmm, really u mean that should be that problem? ok, i try to make it simplier
[04:18:54] <xec> i'm saying i don't quite get the logic behind the code
[04:19:36] <titii> xec: wow, it works :)
[04:19:52] <titii> xec: i did it very simple, it works, thank u
[04:19:57] <snorti> any idear why this http://pastebin.com/fi60iFZ9 wont work only in ie8?
[04:22:01] <xec> snorti: nope. any errors in console?
[04:23:27] <grafi> beacuse ie8
[04:23:29] <grafi> :D
[04:28:21] <snorti> msg'ed you xec
[04:29:05] <WarDekar> i'm having a hell of a time trying to bind a "change" event to a checkbox and i can't figure out what the issue is
[04:29:11] <WarDekar> what's the best way to do such a thing?
[04:29:45] <doug65536> WarDekar:  $('#myCheckboxId').on('change', function(event) { ... });
[04:30:24] <WarDekar> doug65536: doesn't work, i'm selecting by class though if that matters
[04:30:39] <doug65536> WarDekar: trust me, it works. can you show code?
[04:30:48] <WarDekar> i've also tried "$('.checkboxes').change(function()"
[04:30:52] <snorti> xec the ie8 seems not to load my scripts..  oO
[04:30:54] <doug65536> WarDekar: I am assuming a recent version of jquery
[04:31:00] <snorti> or im wrong
[04:31:04] <WarDekar> and "$('.checkboxes').bind('change',.....)"
[04:31:35] <WarDekar> doug: http://dpaste.com/1395814/
[04:31:47] <WarDekar> nothing happens, JS console shows no errors
[04:32:33] <doug65536> WarDekar: http://jsfiddle.net/Ugg3M/1/
[04:33:31] <WarDekar> hmmm wtf... i'm using a CSS template and such that modifies the checkboxes but that shouldn't matter?
[04:33:38] <doug65536> WarDekar: ah, your class name leads me to believe you add the class after. do you?
[04:34:16] <WarDekar> nope it's generated in the template
[04:34:18] <WarDekar> so there in the HTML
[04:34:33] <WarDekar> i even just tried changing it to just all 'input' items like you have
[04:34:35] <WarDekar> and doesn't do it
[04:34:49] <doug65536> WarDekar: it's the only logical explanation if there are no errors. try $('body').on('change', '.active', function(event) { var chkbox = $(event.target); ... });
[04:35:21] <doug65536> why would your checkbox have a class name called "active"
[04:36:16] <doug65536> a class name like 'active' makes me strongly suspect it is being added and removed at runtime
[04:36:41] <doug65536> WarDekar: can you show the html for the checkbox?
[04:36:52] <WarDekar> it isn't... maybe it's a bad choice, but it's to designate whether an account is active or not
[04:37:03] <WarDekar> i just tried it by binding to an ID
[04:37:07] <WarDekar> and no dice there either
[04:37:09] <doug65536> ok, as long as it makes sense to you
[04:37:42] <WarDekar> the checkbox is: "<input class="active" type="checkbox" name="checkboxes" {% if account.active %}checked{% endif %} />"
[04:37:45] <doug65536> WarDekar: I find it hard to believe that there are no errors and that doesn't work. this is absolutely basic stuff
[04:37:59] <WarDekar> yeah that's why i'm really frustrated... there are no JS errors but it doesn't work
[04:39:11] <MiKiOnEs> ok now weard thing happend. why $.get(file,function(data){$('#el').html(data).page('destroy').page()}); duplicate dom with same id ?
[04:39:29] <WarDekar> i feel like maybe it has to do with the fact that the checkbox gets stylized? but not sure why that would matter
[04:39:35] <doug65536> WarDekar:  what is its parent? if it is in an invalid place, like a child of <tr> selectors might malfunction
[04:39:52] <WarDekar> it's a child of a TD
[04:40:00] <WarDekar> proper HTML
[04:40:28] <doug65536> WarDekar: how do you know so sure? you w3c validated it and it passed with 0 errors?
[04:41:09] <doug65536> WarDekar: try this in the debugger console: $('.active')
[04:41:22] <WarDekar> already did and it selects them all
[04:41:54] <doug65536> WarDekar: then I would suggest making sure that the debugger console is set to display "all"
[04:41:54] <WarDekar> i tried "$('.active')[0].change(function() { alert('asdf'); })"
[04:42:03] <doug65536> that won't work for sure
[04:42:12] <WarDekar> well yeah i got a TypeError
[04:42:20] <WarDekar> but it's definitely selecting them in the console
[04:42:43] <doug65536> put this inside (at the start of) your document ready handler: debugger;
[04:42:45] <WarDekar> when i do "$('.active').on('change', function() { alert('asdf'); })"
[04:43:01] <WarDekar> it returns the list of checkboxes
[04:43:11] <WarDekar> but still doesn't give me an alert when i change one
[04:43:11] <doug65536> WarDekar: have your debugger activated and refresh
[04:43:20] <snorti> any idear why this http://pastebin.com/fi60iFZ9 wont work only in ie8?
[04:43:56] <doug65536> WarDekar: I know you would like to convince me that you have everything totally right, but obviously, something is wrong
[04:44:13] <WarDekar> okay turned debugger on
[04:44:33] <doug65536> ok, when it breaks at that debugger statement, try that selector in the console again
[04:44:48] <WarDekar> returns the list
[04:45:04] <doug65536> what version of jquery
[04:45:27] <norbert_> hi, I'm trying to change the appearance of the Facebook like box... http://pastebin.com/E3vVTqSk but it's not working :| any suggestions/ideas?
[04:45:42] <WarDekar> 1.10
[04:45:51] <WarDekar> er wait that can't be right
[04:45:54] <WarDekar> how do i check lol
[04:46:05] <doug65536> WarDekar: what is the src= in the script tag that loads it?
[04:46:14] <WarDekar> it just points to jquery.min.js
[04:46:20] <doug65536> WarDekar: 1.10 is the latest that supports IE6+
[04:46:34] <WarDekar> i think it is 1.10.2
[04:46:36] <doug65536> WarDekar: then you need to look at the source file. which browser
[04:46:59] <doug65536> WarDekar: ok, as long as you aren't using a known old one, I'll trust that it's 1.10
[04:47:01] <WarDekar> yeah i looked at source it's 1.10.2
[04:47:19] <doug65536> WarDekar: old jquery had different event attach functions
[04:47:36] <WarDekar> i really think it has to do with the styling of it is that possible?
[04:47:53] <doug65536> WarDekar: try this: $('.active').css({border: 'solid red 2px'})
[04:48:28] <WarDekar> that returns the list of inputs
[04:48:31] <WarDekar> but doesn't change them
[04:48:35] <WarDekar> visually i mean
[04:48:46] <doug65536> WarDekar: then they aren't the ones that you see
[04:48:48] <WarDekar> it does add the style to it
[04:48:54] <WarDekar> no they are, it adds it to the HTML
[04:48:57] <doug65536> WarDekar: try this: $('input[type=checkbox]').css({border: 'solid red 2px'})
[04:49:00] <WarDekar> but the other CSS styles override it
[04:49:08] <doug65536> no they don't
[04:49:11] <WarDekar> no it adds the 2px solid red border
[04:49:14] <doug65536> .css will completely override css
[04:49:16] <WarDekar> i'm viewing the DOM
[04:49:27] <WarDekar> <input class="active" type="checkbox" checked="" style="position: absolute; opacity: 0; border: 2px solid red;">
[04:49:54] <doug65536> WarDekar: did you do the 2nd type=checkbox one yet?
[04:50:23] <WarDekar> i mean it's the same thing, it adds the style to the checkbox it's just not visible
[04:50:38] <doug65536> WarDekar: ah yes, maybe it won't show it....
[04:51:01] <doug65536> and this is with it frozen at that debugger statement?
[04:51:26] <WarDekar> yes the style has already been applied at that point
[04:51:35] <WarDekar> i feel like that must override the normal checkbox behaviour
[04:51:51] <WarDekar> i don't know why it would
[04:51:54] <doug65536> WarDekar: so you are refusing to put that debugger statement in? feel free to tell me to not bother trying to help
[04:52:08] <WarDekar> i already put the debugger statement in
[04:52:16] <doug65536> is it froze there right now?
[04:52:18] <WarDekar> yes
[04:52:21] <doug65536> ok good
[04:52:23] <WarDekar> adding that style does nothing
[04:52:28] <WarDekar> i mean it adds it to the DOM
[04:52:31] <WarDekar> but it doesn't change visually
[04:52:33] <doug65536> ok
[04:52:57] <doug65536> WarDekar: well, it is possible that some code rips out all event handlers from it later
[04:53:20] <WarDekar> well even paused at the debugger part it won't let me put the .change handler on it
[04:53:27] <doug65536> how do you know
[04:53:33] <WarDekar> because i tried
[04:53:43] <doug65536> how do you know whether the change handler went on
[04:53:47] <doug65536> it won't show up in the dom
[04:54:45] <WarDekar> i also tried just putting an "onclick='javascript:alert();'" in the input and that didn't work which really confused me
[04:55:05] <doug65536> don't put javascript: in there
[04:55:16] <WarDekar> well i tried both, neither works
[04:57:02] <doug65536> WarDekar: if your console is set to all with no errors coming up, and you have jquery 1.10.x, and the selector works in the document ready, and you verified that the selector is matching the appropriate checkbox, one of the few logical explanations left is that some code is calling .off('change') on it
[04:57:40] <WarDekar> but even if that were the case, if i added the .on('change') handler back in the console that should work?
[04:59:54] <ajph> hey, i need JQuery's $.ajax to POST to the current URL. I thought I could do this by adding the $.ajax({â€¦url: 'mypage.php'â€¦ }) but this only works if the user has entered the url with a trailing slash i.e. http://myurl.com/ajax/ - if the user does not use a trailing slash (http://myurl.com/ajax) it tries to post to http://myurl.com - any way around this?
[05:08:03] <MiKiOnEs> hi why jqm dom.load() will duplicate dom element ?
[05:08:46] <doug65536> WarDekar: you tried my fiddle right?
[05:08:58] <doug65536> WarDekar: http://jsfiddle.net/Ugg3M/1/
[05:09:27] <WarDekar> ya
[05:10:09] <doug65536> WarDekar: alert could be replaced. are you sure alert works?
[05:10:25] <WarDekar> ya
[05:10:47] <doug65536> WarDekar: that is a ridiculous possibility, but it's possible to do window.alert = function() { console.log('haha, some sucker called alert'); };
[05:11:20] <WarDekar> i'll just go with another route with 2 buttons that toggle eachother or something ha
[05:11:27] <WarDekar> i have spent way too much time on this already
[05:12:36] <doug65536> WarDekar: which browser btw?
[05:12:42] <WarDekar> Chrome
[05:12:46] <WarDekar> somewhat recent
[05:12:50] <WarDekar> but not most recent i'm sure
[05:13:02] <doug65536> definitely recent enough to handle change event properly
[05:14:08] <doug65536> WarDekar: did you try the delegated version I suggested? using $('body').on('change', '.active', function(event) { ... });
[05:14:23] <doug65536> WarDekar: that is 99.99999% certain to work
[05:14:34] <WarDekar> yup
[05:14:57] <doug65536> even if those controls got removed and recreated the $('body... version would keep working
[05:15:06] <WarDekar> no dice
[05:15:29] <doug65536> WarDekar: did you try restarting chrome? it has subtle memory corruption bugs
[05:16:20] <WarDekar> yeah i tried in FF as well
[05:16:24] <doug65536> WarDekar: also try disabling addons
[05:16:49] <doug65536> WarDekar: it really could be addons. I've seen addons do some *very* weird stuff
[05:17:08] <doug65536> expecially ones that claim to be able to emulate mobiles
[05:17:12] <doug65536> especially*
[05:18:06] <doug65536> WarDekar: you are a victim of something weird. what you're doing takes 15 seconds to implement with jquery
[05:18:26] <WarDekar> yeah that's why i'm frustrated and giving up on it for the night
[05:18:36] <WarDekar> i hate front end work
[05:28:19] <jop008> how to select a value in a select box (multiple)
[05:33:24] <Cork> jop008: you set prop('selected', true) on the option
[05:34:53] <dwarder> does console.log works in jsfiddle?
[05:36:05] <Cork> yes
[05:36:40] <dwarder> Cork: i tried with no luck http://jsfiddle.net/X73hF/
[05:37:07] <dwarder> Cork: wait, don't look at this url
[05:37:11] <Cork> :)
[05:37:17] <Cork> i get the console.dir call
[05:37:52] <dwarder> Cork: you see this in firebug plugin?
[05:37:56] <jop008> So like this?  $('#rentper').prop('midweek', true)

[05:38:12] <jop008> rentper is the field and midweek is the value of an option
[05:38:16] <Cork> jop008: no

[05:38:48] <Cork> jop008: $('#rentper option[value="midweek"]').prop('selected', true)
[05:38:51] <Bergi9> hello together, im using iPad 1st gen (iOS 5.1.1) and if i have a pretty large list in listview, the safari doesnt render them all if i scrolling them. i hope someone know the fix
[05:39:02] <Bergi9> using jquery mobile
[05:39:19] <jop008> like cobol large number of code for such a small thing :-)
[05:40:04] <jop008> thx worked
[05:40:11] <ajph> hey, i need JQuery's $.ajax to POST to the current URL. I thought I could do this by adding the $.ajax({â€¦url: 'mypage.php'â€¦ }) but this only works if the user has entered the url with a trailing slash i.e. http://myurl.com/ajax/ - if the user does not use a trailing slash (http://myurl.com/ajax) it tries to post to http://myurl.com - any way around this?
[05:47:44] <quicksilver> ajph: put an explicit <BASE HREF> in your page's source
[05:47:49] <quicksilver> and then it won't matter.
[05:48:14] <quicksilver> or program your server to redirect from /ajax to /ajax/ so the slash is always there.
[05:48:40] <ajph> it's rails so i don't want to screw with my routing too much
[05:48:49] <ajph> i did window.location.pathname but it felt like there should be a better way
[05:48:55] <snorti> any idear why this http://pastebin.com/fi60iFZ9 wont work only in ie8?
[05:51:44] <Cork> ajph: $.ajax('', {}) should do that
[05:52:20] <Cork> ajph: as the url in websites is relative by default so '' should be the current url
[05:53:13] <Cork> snorti: what's the error?
[05:54:38] <Cork> snorti: btw you can write the click handler there MUCH more efficiently
[05:56:16] <Cork> snorti: http://pastebin.com/bFuemvzc
[05:56:58] <davesleeeep> when you guys do a loading icon

[06:00:15] <ernston> hello
[06:09:10] <pog_> hello, I have MS-IE problem with a jquery galleria-Script (addon im pmwiki). FF, Chrome, Opera, epyphany o.k. :-)
[06:10:41] <pog_> I installed ie-tester on vista, but I wasn't able to correct the Site until now: link: http://orientalcarpetstudio.com.jovinus-meta.net/Carpet/10015
[06:10:45] <doug65536> xmlhttprequest screws up on characters outside the basic multilingual plane, like this ðŸ˜ƒ ?
[06:10:47] <MiKiOnEs> hi can someone explain me why jqm duplicate div with same id adding defrent data-url, one as ui-page-active
[06:11:12] <MiKiOnEs> when posting form
[06:11:46] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: jqm screws with your markup heavily. I've come to expect it
[06:11:47] <pog_> I don't think it's a jquery-galleria problem, but I don't find the implementation error of my site or the galleria-plugin.
[06:13:08] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: is easy way to make it not do so?
[06:13:21] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: it is notorious for littering your DOM with unexpected <span> tags that have the same class as its parent, causing unexpected changes for selectors
[06:14:30] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: not sure. there is an option to turn off "page caching" that may be causing your issue
[06:15:29] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: try changing your page markup to something more like this: <div data-role="page" id="cacheMe" data-dom-cache="false">
[06:15:38] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: the cache part
[06:16:56] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: i using on post metchod id.load(page) to replace content of it
[06:17:20] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: ok i'll try with no data-dom-ceche
[06:18:36] <doug65536> MiKiOnEs: are you manually invoking a .page('create') on the container you .load into?
[06:20:04] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: no i .trigger('pagecreate')
[06:20:57] <ernston> does anyone know any cool jquery examples
[06:21:07] <ernston> jquery + css combined to create interesting visual effects ?
[06:21:19] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: and i using workaround, chasoing container by .ui-page-active cos this dupliaction of div
[06:21:24] <pog_> erneston "GAlleria"
[06:21:26] <ernston> something more dynamic that the standard jquery demos
[06:21:43] <ernston> .io ?
[06:22:41] <MiKiOnEs> dought65536: the data-dom-cache not fix it, it still duplicate divs
[06:23:50] <ernston> "galleria"  ??
[06:24:50] <mls_> hi all
[06:25:46] <mls_> would like to know how to achieve that : http://jsfiddle.net/fRU5z/. Actually variable test is set to 1, when I would like it to get to 2 (after first setTimeout call). Any clue ?
[06:29:03] <Cork> mls_: the update you do if it is less then 2 is then using setTImeout
[06:29:09] <Cork> so yes it will not work
[06:29:35] <mls_> Cork : don't get it
[06:30:12] <Cork> if(number < 2) { timer } return number;
[06:30:23] <mls_> Cork : if less than 2 then I call myself again, and when I'm 2 I should return it
[06:30:24] <Cork> return number won't be affected by the setTimeout
[06:30:34] <Cork> no
[06:30:48] <mls_> Cork : ok, any way to do it ? Like a callback or something ?
[06:31:02] <Cork> you could use a callback yes
[06:31:11] <mls_> Cork digging that, thanks
[06:33:52] <moparisthebest> I need to run some javascript if the page is printed, ie, media=print, is that possible?
[06:34:07] <Cork> mls_: http://jsfiddle.net/fRU5z/1/
[06:34:46] <Cork> moparisthebest: no, you can give them a print button/link though
[06:34:56] <Cork> but if they go the browser native way you can't detect it
[06:37:27] <mls_> Cork : thanks, I was trying to figure out, but your example is working. Gonna learn with it so
[06:38:50] <moparisthebest> Cork: what I don't understand is I can style the page differently for print vs screen, and even set different widths or margins or hide divs, with css, and also javascript runs and can fill in divs and such
[06:39:17] <moparisthebest> but javascript doesn't seem to detect correctly which divs are displayed or any width/margins set by the print media css, even though they display correctly... :(
[06:39:37] <Cork> moparisthebest: that sounds like a browser bug
[06:40:01] <moparisthebest> I agree, except it happens in firefox, chrome, chromium, KHTML etc
[06:40:11] <moparisthebest> so it *seems* pretty standard
[06:40:40] <ernston> anyone?
[06:43:07] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: the print stylesheet is not for browsers
[06:43:33] <NoiseEee> and javascript should have absolutely nothing to do with print css
[06:43:39] <moparisthebest> NoiseEee: it's for use when you click print or print preview right?
[06:43:47] <Cork> moparisthebest: http://code.google.com/p/jmediatype/
[06:44:04] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: right and its independent of javascript
[06:44:47] <moparisthebest> javascript does run though NoiseEee, I filled in a div to be sure
[06:45:14] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: i don't understand the connection you want between the two
[06:45:35] <moparisthebest> I need to modify the page with javascript when printed
[06:45:42] <NoiseEee> what does that mean?
[06:45:48] <moparisthebest> replace an input field with boxes and such
[06:46:02] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: that's what print CSS is for, you do not need javascript for htat
[06:46:07] <Cork> NoiseEee: the js needs to know if the page is loaded in print media state
[06:46:25] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: style the input to appear as a box in the print.css
[06:46:29] <Cork> NoiseEee: if js needs to fix broken things based on the state
[06:48:25] <moparisthebest> so if the input has maxlength=5, i need 5 little boxes, one for each character, don't think that's possible with css alone?
[06:49:21] <NoiseEee>  moparisthebest: hmmm, maybe not
[06:49:50] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: you might want to create a totally new document, it will likely be easier
[06:50:13] <moparisthebest> I was *trying* to avoid that, but I might have to.. :(

[07:15:40] <doug65536> I have an answer for what I asked earlier. jquery handles utf-16 surrogate pairs for unicode outside the basic multilingual plane just fine - it was a problem with my database schema, solved
[07:16:39] <doug65536> knuth: what do you mean by "deal with". do you mean selectors?
[07:22:54] <knuth> I have a lot of page "components" that get reused on each page.  I want to include them on the pages.
[07:23:49] <doug65536> knuth: ah, that isn't really a jquery thing. That is usually done on the server side. You could use .load to pull in fragments with jquery though
[07:24:34] <doug65536> `api knuth load
[07:24:51] * doug65536 looks angrily at b-ot
[07:26:22] <doug65536> knuth: you can use this for that http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:36:51] <MiKiOnEs> hi how prevent jqm to modify url with paramteres after form post ?
[07:41:36] <knuth> In general I have been using the .load function but if I put the dependencies in the page they conflict with the parent page.
[07:42:38] <knuth> .
[07:42:55] <knuth> more simple example.  How do you deal with your menus?
[07:48:55] <BillCriswell> Does anyone know if they ever found out the cause of Barnaby Jack's death?
[08:00:17] <gho5t> anyone have experience with this plugin: http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/
[08:00:56] <ernston> BillCriswell, burning to death ?
[08:01:10] <ernston> this the same guy who revealled who anything can be hacked?
[08:01:16] <ernston> worked for black something ?
[08:03:06] <BillCriswell> ernston: No, just dead at 35. Pretty strange.
[08:03:29] <ernston> whose the guy who revealed how to hack atm's and medical machines etc..
[08:03:31] <ernston> he died
[08:03:36] <BillCriswell> ernston: Yes, him.
[08:06:00] <ernston> sounds too dodgey
[08:06:14] <BillCriswell> ernston: Agreed.
[08:06:43] <ernston> may have died in hacked vehicle ?
[08:06:53] <ernston> scary stuff
[08:07:25] <BillCriswell> His girlfriend found him. I'd think it would have to be like... overdose or erotic asphyxiation at 35.
[08:08:35] <ernston> wtf did i just read then
[08:08:43] <ernston> says he died in a car
[08:08:44] <ernston> :s

[08:15:35] <recognosco> is it the right place to ask qunit questions?
[08:15:43] <Krinkle> Sure
[08:17:41] <recognosco> i am trying to automate qunit tests via commandline by looking at this: https://npmjs.org/package/qunit -- problem is i am not understanding the file structure. where does the setup file go?
[08:19:06] <knuth> Question: Is it ok to your $.getScript on mass?  Will it mess up cache?
[08:20:10] <knuth> In the end I want one file where I put the dozen .js includes I have on each page.
[08:20:46] <knuth> Is it ok to have a .js which then calls .getScript on each include I need in the project.
[08:22:03] <anli__> What exactly is <label for> used for?
[08:22:20] <anli__> Can the browser do something with the connection from the label to the referred to element?
[08:23:32] <slax0r> anli__: the label is then bound to the element
[08:23:41] <anli__> Well, not geometrically
[08:24:10] <slax0r> huh?
[08:24:31] <anli__> There is no placement constraint of a label
[08:24:41] <anli__> Maybe it can be in the other side of the webpage, dunno
[08:26:21] <ernston> BillCriswell you make like this: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24231077
[08:26:28] <slax0r> sure you can...
[08:26:42] <slax0r> now position your input at top of the page and it's label bound to that input at bottom
[08:26:47] <slax0r> de-focus the input
[08:26:52] <slax0r> and click on the label
[08:35:21] <BillCriswell> ernston: I can't believe how much money and effort we spend on things that sole purpose is to kill people.
[08:36:20] <c4ptnh00k2> BillCriswell: still doesnt compare to the sum spent in boner pills...
[08:41:18] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: I'm fine with that haha.
[08:42:13] <c4ptnh00k2> lol. not sure if its related, but the more funding we get in reproduction seems to coincide with the efficiency of murder...
[08:44:08] <jax> how can i update only a value of a dict instead of overwriting the whole dict?
[08:44:19] <recognosco> anyone has any experience qith qunit node package? i am stuck :(
[08:44:42] <jax> dict / associative array
[08:44:55] <ernston> BillCriswell the agenda is bad
[08:44:55] <Krinkle> knuth: $.getScript does indeed  invalidate the url with a cache buster, that'll screw your cache
[08:45:08] <Krinkle> knuth: I'd recommend using $.ajax instead with the proper parameters
[08:45:16] <ernston> but along the way the technology discovered is amazing
[08:45:40] <Krinkle> knuth: $.getScript is nothing but a shortcut to $.ajax, it literally uses $.ajax, just use that directly and be sure to set cache: true/false accordingly.
[08:45:43] <ernston> create to destroy
[08:45:50] <Krinkle> recognosco: I've used it (the npm package)
[08:45:51] <jax> $('#gauge1').jqxGauge('caption', { value: String(n1) });
[08:45:58] <jax> is what i'm doing, but that overrides the other values of the caption dict
[09:00:20] <recognosco> Krinkle|detached: i am trying to run qunit from command line but somehow can't get it to work.
[09:04:26] <recognosco> hmmm
[09:28:58] <zmode> hi guys. i have a .each() statement that populates an array, which i afterwards need to stringify. however i get "[]" back, although there should be contents in it. the code looks like this: http://sprunge.us/iXTL
[09:29:44] <zmode> someone in ##javascript pointed out the order in which console.log() statements appear in my browser is reversed, an hinted that .each() might be the issue. any ideas?
[09:33:47] <_rgn> zmode: what's the goal here
[09:34:23] <zmode> _rgn: stringify allWorks and POST it to the server
[09:37:09] <jphase> zmode: does console.log(oneContent) work inside that .each?
[09:37:43] <jphase> the code looks fine at first glance :\
[09:38:21] <jphase> maybe try console.log(allWorks); right after you push each item onto the array to make sure that's working as expected
[09:40:49] <BillCriswell> zmode: I feel like you're leaving something out. Are you running $(table).each() in a callback somewhere?
[09:42:06] <zmode> BillCriswell: no but i do run .each() in a function that's called while populating the data. let me get more code up
[09:43:36] <BillCriswell> zmode: populating via ajax?
[09:43:45] <BillCriswell> Cause that would cause the problem for certain.
[09:43:52] <zmode> BillCriswell: no, just from the page's DOM
[09:43:56] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[09:44:26] <zmode> BillCriswell: http://dpaste.com/1396116/
[09:47:26] <BillCriswell> Your console.log() is inside the .each() here. Does it have what you expect as you do it inside the .each() ?
[09:49:44] <BillCriswell> zmode: Also, if you're trying to log allWorks outside of the fadeOut it won't exist.
[09:50:42] <zmode> BillCriswell: yes. i just went through the data
[09:51:02] <zmode> BillCriswell: oh dear.
[09:51:25] <bergamot2> I'm having quicker (<300 ms when called alone) ajax request seemingly "wait" until the longer request (~2000ms) responds, when the shorter request was made after the longer request...
[09:51:37] <BillCriswell> zmode: That seems like a good "oh dear".
[09:51:43] <bergamot2> and I'm not using async: false
[09:52:04] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: How many?
[09:52:07] <bergamot2> is it possible that this is happenning in PHP/mySQL?
[09:52:29] <bergamot2> BillCriswell: I am testing using 1 long request (2 seconds), followed immediately by a much shorter request (200ms)
[09:52:36] <bergamot2> testing in chrome dev tools
[09:52:38] <zmode> BillCriswell: indeed. the data just made it to the server. i now hate brackets with a passion
[09:52:57] <BillCriswell> zmode: That sounds fixed?!
[09:53:05] <zmode> BillCriswell: yes. thank you
[09:53:10] <BillCriswell> zmode: Welcome!
[09:53:52] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: Ahhh. Got it... Not sure what would caue that.
[09:54:17] <bergamot2> and when I say longer and shorter, I mean, that when these requests are made independently with no real "queue", those are their response times. But one made one after another (first the longer, and then the shorter), they seem to be "waiting" on the longest request.
[09:55:12] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: Are you using PHP's built in server or apache or something?
[09:55:22] <BillCriswell> Are you using PHP?
[09:55:24] <bergamot2> BillCriswell: apache
[09:55:28] <BillCriswell> Kind of jumped to that conclusion.
[09:55:30] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: Ah.
[09:55:37] <bergamot2> BillCriswell: yup, PHP5, apache, and PostgreSQL
[09:56:14] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: Can you replicate it in a different browser?
[09:56:36] <bergamot2> BillCriswell: hmm, I'll run the tests on firefox and internet explorer, good idea
[10:02:01] <NoiseEee> bergamot2: is this not intentional, ie: are you using deferreds / .when() / promises?
[10:03:36] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee, bergamot2: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10923616/apache-makes-some-ajax-request-behave-synchronously I came across this. Interesting read kind of.
[10:07:41] <recognosco> hello. i am stuck with node-qunit. when i run this command: qunit --code code:./tests/javascript/code.js --tests ./tests/javascript/tests.js -- i get this error -- ReferenceError: sample_echo is not defined
[10:08:31] <rjcousineau> Hi, i'm detecting mouse scroll movement using body.on('DOMMouseScroll mousewheel') but it doesn't seem to work on android set-top device with a mouse attached.. using the scroll wheel on the mouse doesnt seem to be firing the same event.  I've tried body.on('DOMMouseScroll mousewheel startscroll stopscroll') but that didn't work.. would anyone know?

[10:10:58] <recognosco> anyone?
[10:12:52] <thaifood> hi
[10:13:11] <thaifood> Can jQuery add a tooltip to this?  <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-plus"></span>
[10:22:00] <bpmj> Hey all. With window.postMessage I can send info from a cross-domain iframe to it's parent. Is there anything similar for sending a message from the parent to the child?
[10:25:57] <thaifood> I tried to add a tooltip title attrib but doesn't seem to work.  $('.ui-icon-plus').attr('title', 'your new title');
[10:26:17] <thaifood> to a span...... <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-plus"></span>
[10:26:39] <thaifood> can jquery do that ?
[10:27:10] <jphase> thaifood: jquery can add a title attribute just fine yeah, perhaps the tooltip you're using doesn't recognize it cause the tooltip call is happening before you add the title attribute?
[10:27:25] <jphase> also you probably want to start using .prop instead of .attr if you want to be forwards-compatible
[10:27:27] <thaifood> i have it in doc ready
[10:27:46] <thaifood> is .prop the same syntax ?
[10:27:49] <jphase> yeah
[10:27:54] <jphase> just make sure you do your .prop('title', 'your new title') before your .tooltip() or whatever
[10:28:35] <thaifood> i have jqgrid that builds grids and it has these spans in it,  i'm trying to add a tooltip to the span
[10:29:36] <jphase> I would imagine you'd need to do your jqgrid call, then your .prop to add titles, then your tooltip call
[10:30:20] <thaifood> thx
[10:38:51] <BillCriswell> bergamot2: Anything? Kind of curious.
[10:53:14] <kpl> I have an input type text for which I have called inputobj.attr("value", label), and the input text has become equal to label. For that input I have inputobj.change(function () { alert($(this).attr("value")); }. When I change the text in the input and press ENTER; then the alert shows the text before I edited it, and not the new/modified text. How can I get the new text?
[10:55:24] <jphase> kpl: you may want to bind to keyup instead
[10:55:38] <jphase> also you should use .prop instead of .attr for future proofing
[10:55:49] <RadListControl1> is there some way to hide the text cursor
[10:56:32] <jphase> RadListControl1: cursor: none in css?
[10:57:16] <RadListControl1> hmm that works good for the mouse cursor
[10:57:19] <bergamot2> BillCriswell: sorry, got caught up with something, but yes, Firefox is doing the same thing
[10:57:21] <RadListControl1> but what about the text cursor
[10:58:05] <jphase> RadListControl1: oh if you still see text cursor on cursor: none; then that might be a native browser thing... your browser might not care what your cursor property is
[10:58:22] <RadListControl1> hmm I see
[10:58:31] <bergamot2> NoiseEee: nope, not intentional, it's just a straight up ajax call, and a $(document).ajaxSend/.ajaxStop binding for some of the animation/changes, but I can see in the network panel of the browsers that the responses seem to be coming in one after another...
[10:58:53] <RadListControl1> well how would I simulate the user typing somewhere they're not then
[10:59:03] <kpl> jphase: Thanks. .prop works, and keyup makes it nicer too!
[10:59:14] <jphase> RadListControl1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor
[10:59:25] <jphase> check that list for campatibility and such
[10:59:34] <RadListControl1> that's the mouse cursor again
[10:59:41] <RadListControl1> I don't care about the mouse cursor in this case
[10:59:45] <kpl> jphase: should I use prop to set the value too?
[10:59:56] <jphase> RadListControl1:  ohh, do you mean the blinky guy in the box?
[11:00:02] <RadListControl1> yeah
[11:00:16] <RadListControl1> the blinky line where yuo're about to type, I want it to either be hidden, or appear elsewhere
[11:00:42] <jphase> yeah, with blur I think you can... sec
[11:00:48] <jphase> RadListControl1:  http://jsfiddle.net/3V8F6/1/
[11:01:01] <jphase> nvm, that's bunk lol
[11:01:18] <jphase> that disables the input entirely
[11:01:28] <jphase> idk, I've never had to do that b4 ... hmm
[11:01:37] <RadListControl1> hmm but then they can't type
[11:01:43] <RadListControl1> isn't there a way to hide it, and they can type?
[11:02:02] <RadListControl1> yeah me either
[11:02:16] <RadListControl1> it's a purplexing problem heh
[11:02:21] <jphase> RadListControl1: doesn't look like this is possible without ruining the input
[11:02:38] <jphase> BillCriswell: might know better than I on this
[11:03:05] <jphase> I'm fairly certain if you can't do this with css you can't do it with js/jquery either
[11:03:11] <RadListControl1> oic
[11:03:12] <RadListControl1> hmm
[11:03:18] <RadListControl1> not even with tricks and nonsense?
[11:03:21] <jphase> kpl:  yes, all .attr is now .prop
[11:03:24] <jphase> same syntax
[11:03:44] <jphase> RadListControl1: at least not with a native text input
[11:04:32] <jphase> you could make a div or something that's styled like an input and bind events to it and such, but you're now talking about something totally different and it wouldn't natively work with <form> tags and such
[11:04:48] <RadListControl1> hmm I see
[11:05:10] <RadListControl1> another idea, (more css really) can I move a input inside an li to another place on the page, then make it transparent?
[11:05:27] <jphase> yes
[11:05:32] <darkfrog> Are there any examples of creating a jQuery plugin that allows options to be set after the fact?  All of the tutorials I've found don't seem to include such support.
[11:05:42] <RadListControl1> hmm cool maybe i'll try that
[11:05:58] <darkfrog> For example: $('...').myPlugin('option', 'color', 'red');
[11:05:59] <jphase> darkfrog: yeah with .extend
[11:06:38] <darkfrog> jphase: yeah, for initial instantiation of the plugin, but I'm talking about modification after first invocation.
[11:07:01] <jphase> oh, yeah, you'll need a callback function that sets the variables of your plugin
[11:07:17] <darkfrog> jphase: any good examples?
[11:08:13] <jphase> yeah you'll just do a $.fn.setvar = function(value){ myvar = value; });   type of thing
[11:08:30] <jphase> then you can call with your $.myPlugin.setvar('valuehere'); type thing
[11:08:49] <jphase> well, there may be a better appraoch to that, but that's how I do it anyhow
[11:09:26] <darkfrog> hmmm, this is interesting: http://starter.pixelgraphics.us/
[11:14:19] <jphase> yeah I suppose... personally I like to write my own code, but that's just me :\
[11:21:38] <ajpiano> jphase: if you use the jQuery UI Widget factory you get that API
[11:21:41] <ajpiano> for free
[11:21:51] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/widget/
[11:22:27] <jphase> ajpiano:  I'm not really sure what you're talking about
[11:22:36] <ajpiano> changing options after the fact
[11:23:09] <jphase> sure, lots of plugins that are coded correctly have callback functions
[11:23:24] <jphase> I assume whichever jqgrid/tooltip plugin you were using didn't offer that
[11:23:48] <ajpiano> oh
[11:23:53] <ajpiano> i meant to address that to darkfrog
[11:24:04] <jphase> haha, okay now that makes more sense
[11:25:44] <Phoenixz> What might a selector like $("<pub/img/>")  do exactly? I have never seen < or > in selectors, and I have no idea what this is supposed to select..
[11:25:59] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/OfUwEQu/1/
[11:26:01] <Phoenixz> And yes, I am looking at code from somebody else :) Nothing mentioned about this in documentation
[11:26:02] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[11:26:10] <Phoenixz> yes?
[11:26:43] <Bloomberg> If there are more than 12 input pairs, how can I pass this data with post ?
[11:28:09] <Danny^^P> Hey! I have a page, where I do some getJSON calls. I want to display a "loading" progress bar, until all of the JSON Calls are done. How can I do this?
[11:29:26] <mdev> before the first call you can write the gif/html code to a div displaying the loading whatever
[11:29:39] <mdev> then when all the calls finish can remove the html for that div
[11:30:07] <mdev> determining when all calls finish, idk, maybe track with a global variable, or make the calls one after another with final making the html code changes
[11:30:13] <AntelopeSalad> hello, i'm having a really gross problem with the standard jquery validation plugin -- http://pastie.org/8355152 -- basically name.val() is never the actual input value (a text field), it's always what it was when the page loads
[11:30:31] <AntelopeSalad> if i replace the name.val() value with "Test" then it works normally
[11:30:47] <AntelopeSalad> i'm thinking it has to be some type of closure/scope issue but i have no idea how to fix it :<
[11:31:11] <dstarh> Experimenting with using an old jqueryUI (1.5.2) with a modern version of jquery (1.9.1) by including the jquery.migrate plugin.  So far everything seems to be behaving except for one oddity.  When using ui-1.5.2 with jq-1.3.2 when creating a dialog, it copies the dialogs class up to the outermost wrapper class
[11:31:14] <Danny^^P> mdev: Thanks for the advice!
[11:31:31] <moparisthebest> whats the best way to detect inside a function that one parameter wasn't provided? if (text == undefined || text == '') or if (!text) ?
[11:31:32] <dstarh> with the 1.9.1/1.5.2/migrate combo that no longer happens
[11:32:24] <jonez> I have a jquery-ui question (datepicker widget). is that on-topic?
[11:34:08] <jphase> jonez: sure
[11:34:22] <jonez> k
[11:34:58] <jonez> I need to pick a range of dates. I set numberOfMonths to 3. when the dialog opens, it shows october instead of september.
[11:35:40] <jonez> I tried to fix that by using showCurrentAtPos set to 1. no change.
[11:37:22] <jonez> jphase, http://freenodephp.privatepaste.com/bc2f3945ef
[11:41:50] <jonez> any ideas?
[11:42:04] <jphase> god I h8 Microsoft with a passion
[11:42:14] <jphase> jonez: I missed the question
[11:42:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jphase: I appreciate so much the effort you're doing here for people here who need help
[11:42:37] <jphase> aww shucks <3   np
[11:42:42] <jonez> I was wondering why I see october as the first month instead of september
[11:42:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you helped me out a lot yesterday
[11:42:50] <jonez> I tried to fix that by using showCurrentAtPos set to 1. no change.
[11:42:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> free of charge...
[11:43:12] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: that's just cause you have ptang in your name ;)
[11:43:16] <shoky> jonez: it's because the changeMonth:true isn't working good with the numberOfMonths>1
[11:43:16] <krawchyk> what's the best way to throttle listening to events? for example, window resize or scroll
[11:43:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ni!
[11:43:44] <jonez> shoky, ok I'll try
[11:43:52] <shoky> jonez: oh actually
[11:44:25] <shoky> jonez: without  showCurrentAtPos it seems fine
[11:44:46] <jonez> that is something I added to try to fix the problem
[11:44:53] <jonez> it would always show october
[11:45:07] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/IyeGuFE/1/
[11:45:09] <jonez> also, what is the option to allow a date before today to be accepted?
[11:45:10] <shoky> jonez: http://jsfiddle.net/D2e3Y/1/  where's the problem?
[11:45:13] <Bloomberg> someone can help me with this?
[11:48:59] <shoky> jonez: and about your last question... minDate ?
[11:49:51] <jonez> shoky, I changed it to -1m ... is that invalid?
[11:50:08] <shoky> jonez: no, it's working fine
[11:50:16] <Bloomberg> shoky: can you help me?
[11:50:34] <jphase> Bloomberg: if I were you I'd start by describing the problem...
[11:51:11] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/IyeGuFE/1/
[11:51:13] <Bloomberg> see that
[11:51:22] <jphase> yes, that's code
[11:51:30] <jphase> what seems to be the problem?
[11:51:43] <shoky> Bloomberg: $("#activity").val()  is a string. you shouldn't $.each it
[11:53:00] <HenryCH> Hi guys, I'm using jquery to send a post request to a .php when a user clicks a link, and I've added some data attributes to the <a> so that I can pass that on to the .php for processing. I'm using the following code inside the ajax request for the data part: data: { id : $('#joinlink').data() },
[11:53:20] <HenryCH> However when I echo the variable in the php I get back simply "Array"
[11:53:24] <HenryCH> it's supposed to be a single number
[11:54:02] <nhulea> hey how come in this script  http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/wJN4h/ $input1.val(); only returns the last val() ?
[11:54:46] <jphase> HenryCH:  do a var_dump of it in php so you can grab the right array index
[11:54:50] <HenryCH> Is it because it's sending both the key and the value?
[11:55:02] <HenryCH> yep ok let me try
[11:55:05] <jphase> perhaps, could be like array(0 => 'value');
[11:55:18] <shoky> HenryCH: how is it a number?  .data() with no arguments gets you an object with all data keys for the element
[11:55:18] <Bloomberg> will be llike this :::  var dat = $.each($("#activity").val());
[11:55:29] <Bloomberg> like*
[11:55:32] <shoky> Bloomberg:  you can't $.each on a string
[11:55:42] <Bloomberg> so, how can I get it
[11:55:46] <shoky> get what
[11:55:59] <Bloomberg> I need get all the values of inputs
[11:56:25] <shoky> you can't have multiple elements with the same id..
[11:56:49] <Bloomberg> I'm generating dinamically a pair of input according the number of records from the DB
[11:57:01] <Bloomberg> for example there are ten input pairs
[11:57:09] <Bloomberg> I need to pass all the values
[11:57:11] <shoky> use a class instead,  then  $('.activity').map(function() { return this.value }).get()   will get you an array of values
[11:57:14] <jonez> found my bug. RFO: PEBCCK.
[11:57:20] <jonez> er.. PEBCAK
[11:58:01] <HenryCH> yep that was it jphase, thanks
[11:58:06] <jphase> np
[11:58:47] <Bloomberg> shoky: but how can I access to that array of values then
[11:59:05] <shoky> Bloomberg: i just told you how
[11:59:12] <darkfrog> This code works: https://gist.github.com/darkfrog26/6704305 (it's just a very basic jQuery plugin at the moment), but I'm getting an error in my console: "TypeError: t is undefined" when I call $('myDiv').history();
[11:59:31] <Bloomberg> ok
[11:59:40] <darkfrog> Any assistance would be appreciated....I know JavaScript and jQuery fairly well, but I'm just now getting around to learning to write plugins.
[12:02:23] <Bloomberg> shoky : so will be like this http://jsbin.com/OpASUKa/1/
[12:04:41] <moparisthebest> $("input[type=checkbox][name]").each();  is there a way to run that but sort by name first for example?
[12:05:19] <shoky> darkfrog: line 16 is wrong.. you've set "this" to be the jquery object
[12:05:24] <moparisthebest> so if names of checkboxes on my page are bob0, tom0, bob1, tom1, my function will loop through them in the order bob0, bob1, tom0, tom1 ?
[12:06:28] <darkfrog> shoky: so how do I reference the option function from init?
[12:06:52] <shoky> darkfrog: methods.option
[12:07:12] <shoky> darkfrog: but uhh. you only have one global options object..
[12:07:27] <darkfrog> shoky: interesting....such forward references aren't allowed in most languages. :)
[12:07:31] <shoky> darkfrog: line 2, this === window
[12:07:58] <shoky> you need to re-think some things
[12:08:22] <shoky> and go through:  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:08:23] <darkfrog> shoky: it works now
[12:08:38] <shoky> darkfrog: you'll get unexpected surprises soon enough
[12:08:39] <darkfrog> shoky: already read that, but it leaves out a lot of info
[12:09:08] <shoky> you're setting options on the global window object...
[12:09:36] <darkfrog> shoky: would you like to suggest some changes to this: https://gist.github.com/darkfrog26/6704305
[12:09:56] <shoky> i already did..
[12:10:25] <shoky> don't set options for your plugin instances on "window"
[12:10:33] <darkfrog> shoky: I changed the methods reference, but where should I set the options?
[12:10:37] <shoky> that's the biggest issue you've got
[12:10:57] <darkfrog> shoky: I was basing my work on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14800095/how-to-correctly-implement-option-update-method-in-jquery-plugin
[12:11:14] <Bloomberg> shoky: doesn't works
[12:11:32] <shoky> darkfrog: then don't because he doesn't know what he's doing
[12:12:06] <darkfrog> shoky: hehe, fair enough, but I'm not sure how to modify this to store the options local to the jQuery selector.
[12:13:58] <shoky> darkfrog read the link i gave you, throroughly, especially the "Data" part.
[12:16:52] <Velveeta> if you want to store stateful data with instances of your plugin, you shouldn't be writing it as a plugin, you should be writing it using the ui widget factory
[12:17:04] <shoky> darkfrog: and btw the jquery-ui widget factory gives you exactly the kind of interface you're looking for
[12:17:14] <Velveeta> highfive!
[12:17:20] <shoky> oh lol
[12:17:22] <shoky> :D
[12:17:41] <darkfrog> shoky: what if I don't want to use jquery-ui though?
[12:17:42] <grafi> best jquery-ui widget factory friends forever
[12:17:43] <grafi> ^^
[12:17:44] <Kaylors> Can anyone tell me why it is that JS sometimes runs and sometimes just doesnt?
[12:17:54] <Velveeta> i think a lot of people tend to overlook the widget factory because they think a ui widget needs to be some form of actual visual component as opposed to a stateful widget in general
[12:18:07] <Kaylors> I mean it's the same site, same everything, except that sometimes its working fine and sometimes not at all.
[12:18:17] <shoky> darkfrog: it should be simple enough to modify the template in the link i gave you to have an "option" method
[12:18:49] <Velveeta> kaylors: we need something a little less vague than that to go off ofâ€¦ off the top of my head, i'd say there's some kind of conditional execution in there somewhere that's not being evaluated properly
[12:19:36] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/CbpY9/
[12:20:32] <Velveeta> whoa
[12:20:37] <Velveeta> that code's all over the place
[12:21:05] <archfool> I have a jquery mobile page with collapsable widgets.  I have a handler on expand to load another page into its child div.  However this child page also has jquery mobile items on it. How do I get them to initialize?
[12:21:31] <archfool> child page inserts fine, just doesn't display any jq mobile widgets as such. All data is there.
[12:22:08] <Kaylors> Velveeta: I have some basic form-validation going on with JQuery. Just checking if the fields are empty, if the T&C is checked, stuff like that. Most of the time it works. But then sometimes even an invalid form is allowed to be submitted. https://gist.github.com/Kaylors/6704681
[12:22:43] <Velveeta> archfool: i think you can trigger the create function on your page to force it to re-render mobile widgets
[12:23:18] <Velveeta> kaylors: if something is throwing an exception as part of the validation, it can cause the form to submit
[12:23:49] <Kaylors> Velveeta: I get that. But in the exact same test conditions, why would it sometimes work and sometimes not?
[12:23:59] <archfool> 			$("#paf_data").load("?pagetype=paf #paf_content");     Then?   $("#paf_data").trigger('create');   ???
[12:24:40] <Velveeta> kaylors: i'm not sure, are you seeing any exceptions in the console?
[12:24:51] <Velveeta> archfool: i *believe* so, yes
[12:25:13] <Kaylors> Velveeta: Nope. Nothing. Everything seems to be working fine. During the times its not working, its as if the JS isnt even there.
[12:25:30] <archfool> Nope.  That's not it. :(
[12:25:34] <archfool> phhoey.
[12:26:12] <archfool> I have to wait until the $('#paf_data').load() event to do this AFTER done loading, or is .load() synchronous?
[12:26:25] <Kaylors> Velveeta: I'm building my app in Rails and deploying on Heroku. The problem I talked about mainly occurs when restarting the server. Could it be that it takes a while after server is restarted to allow for JS to kick in? I dont why that would be, though since JS is supposed to be client-side.
[12:26:25] <Velveeta> kaylors: try dumping some console.log statements at the very end of your validation routine and make sure they're outputting in both cases?
[12:27:03] <Kaylors> Velveeta: I did that. But nothing was output. As I said, it's as if the JS wasnt even there.
[12:30:27] <maxmoore14> Can anyone with jquery mobile experience take a look at this for me? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18985819/how-to-use-html-conditional-statements-with-jquery-mobile
[12:35:03] <boytoy> maxmoore14: could always do user agent matching instead..
[12:35:57] <boytoy> maxmoore14: im using http://ruby-journal.com/how-to-block-old-ie-version-with-rails/ alongside jquery mobile to render the exact type of message i see you're trying to render
[12:36:35] <boytoy> where was that stackoverflow question showing the mobile equivalent, cant seem to find it
[12:36:45] <boytoy> * showing the jquery equivalent
[12:37:22] <boytoy> maxmoore14: righto -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514784/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-a-handheld-device-in-jquery should be good for detecting IE i reckon?
[12:37:46] <maxmoore14> boytoy: yeah, I think that would work
[12:38:21] <maxmoore14> I was really hoping to embed in html, but doesn't matter too much I guess
[12:38:43] <maxmoore14> I'm just confused why my current method isn't working at all
[12:38:56] <Bloomberg> I'm getting this  ::: -- [14:38:44.338] TypeError: Argument 1 of Node.appendChild is not an object. @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js?_=1380137917226:4
[12:39:02] <Bloomberg> why?
[12:40:05] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg:  more context please.
[12:40:29] <darkfrog> shoky: how about some feedback on this: https://gist.github.com/darkfrog26/6704305 ? :)
[12:40:38] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: ie: show us YOUR script where thats a problem, not jquery source.
[12:41:13] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/aa2NH/
[12:42:03] <maxmoore14> what about using $.support ?
[12:42:28] <maxmoore14> is there a direct method for accessing the old .browser info that was pre-1.9?
[12:43:07] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: you can use the jquery migrate plugni
[12:43:10] <Velveeta> plugin*
[12:43:33] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: just what do you think you're appending there?
[12:43:37] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: what are you trying to do?
[12:43:57] <Bloomberg> I'm going to show you my script
[12:44:10] <Velveeta> bloomberg: also, i think you have your logic backwardsâ€¦ the context of that chain is going to be #reportForms, not the inputs you're trying to get the .val() of
[12:44:12] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: seems excessive to simply warn users about IE <10
[12:44:55] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: well, you could always sniff the user agent string yourself if that's what you're talking about
[12:45:42] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yeah. Just seems like a relatively common thing to do. assumed there would be a standard way
[12:45:51] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/HrzCE/
[12:46:14] <Bloomberg> For example I have 15 input pairs
[12:46:40] <Bloomberg> So, I need to get each one value of these inputs for to pass
[12:46:58] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: the problem is that it's a relatively common thing, but it's bad practice, you should be doing feature detection, not browser detection
[12:47:12] <Velveeta> jquery decided to draw a line in the sand for themselves, and that's where it's at
[12:48:16] <archfool> Any other ideas on how to "process" jqm items after a .load() into a div?
[12:48:42] <Velveeta> archfool: sorry, had a work call interrupt that, let me see if i can dig up another option
[12:48:56] <shoky> darkfrog: looking much better
[12:49:27] <shoky> darkfrog: should add a "return" on line 21
[12:49:35] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: pass to where?
[12:49:37] <archfool> No problem, Velveeta.  I appreciate any help you can offer.
[12:49:44] <Bloomberg> php controller
[12:49:52] <Bloomberg> I need to pass them with post jquery
[12:49:57] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: consider trying to achive your goal on *multiple* lines instead of just chaining stuff, it might make things clearer for you.
[12:50:07] <Bloomberg> $.post('my_controller'm function(){});
[12:50:18] <NoiseEee> i don't get why you're using .map at all, or .html
[12:50:23] <Velveeta> archfool: this may be a good place to start: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8357756/jquery-mobile-forcing-refresh-of-content
[12:50:37] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: So how you will do it?
[12:50:37] <archfool> danke
[12:50:42] <shoky> darkfrog:  also check your $this in line 28
[12:50:44] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:51:13] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: serialize() ?
[12:51:23] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: help me plz!!
[12:51:41] <Bloomberg> How can I get all the values of these inputs
[12:51:55] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ @ Bloomberg
[12:52:06] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: i just don't understand your code, it seems like you're just trying a bunch of stuff to see what happens
[12:52:10] <darkfrog> shoky: yeah, I'm starting over from scratch with what I've learned thus far and building from the PluginsAuthoring doc you referenced.
[12:57:44] <Bloomberg> MoiseEee: with this example you how will get the values of all inputs  ::  http://jsfiddle.net/jShst/
[13:01:30] <Velveeta> bloomberg: do you *just* need the values, or do you need the names for them also?
[13:01:55] <maxmoore14> instead of browser detection then, how about a check for support of XHR2? what would that look like?
[13:02:10] <Velveeta> e.g. if you nave input name="blah" value="1" and input name="blahblah" value="2", do you need ["1", "2"] or do you need { blah: "1", blahblah: "2" } ?
[13:02:52] <juboba_> hey
[13:03:07] <Velveeta> if (new XMLHttpRequest().upload)
[13:04:12] <juboba_> I'm having trouble loading a partial: I'm loading a div with some contents (emulating what one used to do with frames). Everything works well unless I use tabs inside. ¿is this a known issue?
[13:04:25] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: ok, thanks. Should I wrap it in try/catch too?
[13:04:50] <juboba_> I'm using $('#container').load(url);
[13:04:57] <Velveeta> i don't think you should need to, it's a falsy check, so it should evaluate just fine even where it's not supported
[13:06:23] <maxmoore14> k
[13:11:28] <Bloomberg> Velveeta: only the values
[13:12:44] <recognosco> trying to get QUnit work, why is qunit not finding my code unless i use exports
[13:13:04] <Krinkle> recognosco: browser or node?
[13:13:20] <recognosco> node
[13:13:58] <Velveeta> then you can probably do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jShst/4/
[13:14:11] <Krinkle> recognosco: are you using plain qunitjs or a third-party node package (such as qunit)?
[13:14:17] <Krinkle> npm package*
[13:14:44] <Velveeta> krinkle: btw, i still haven't talked to our testswarm guy, but i did figure out my issue w/ the testem package we were using
[13:14:53] <recognosco> Krinkle: node package - installed like this: npm install qunit
[13:14:55] <Velveeta> it was mostly my own damned fault
[13:15:12] <Krinkle> recognosco: there is https://npmjs.org/package/qunitjs and https://npmjs.org/package/qunit
[13:15:35] <Krinkle> qunitjs is the official one, plain. qunit is an abstraction and maintained by someone else, though it does build on the plain node.
[13:15:42] <Krinkle> anyway, it should be working fine though
[13:16:01] <Krinkle> recognosco: example: https://github.com/Krinkle/travis-ci-node-and-browser-qunit/blob/master/test/node-index.js
[13:18:06] <Bloomberg> Velveeta: show me this  :::  -- [15:17:53.007] TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement. @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js?_=1380140265540:4
[13:18:46] <Velveeta> bloomberg: don't show it to us in the jquery source, especially not in a minified version of itâ€¦ show us an actual use example
[13:19:16] <Velveeta> but from that error, it sounds like you're trying to pass a non-input element to your function
[13:19:27] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: at *some* point you're going to actually have to take time to learn instead of throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks
[13:19:44] <recognosco> Krinkle: thanks. looked through it. how do start the job? i tried: node testrunner.js
[13:19:44] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/jShst/5/
[13:20:16] <Velveeta> noiseeee: that's exactly the analogy i was thinking of
[13:20:37] <Krinkle> recognosco: node test/node-index.js
[13:20:55] <Krinkle> what is testrunner.js?
[13:20:59] <Velveeta> bloomberg: you have to return this.value from that map function, not this
[13:21:16] <recognosco> Krinkle: i kind of got it to work, but qunit doesn't find my functions unless i use exports.
[13:21:54] <Krinkle> recognosco: I don't know what you mean by that (I know that an export is and what it means when js cant' find a function, just not making sense)
[13:22:00] <Bloomberg> Velveeta: What I'm doing wrong?
[13:22:06] <Velveeta> bloomberg: i just told you
[13:22:14] <NoiseEee> new question, what are you doing *right* ?
[13:22:21] <NoiseEee> because that answer is 'not a whle lot'
[13:22:23] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:22:26] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: please take time to learn.
[13:22:51] <Velveeta> bloomberg: if you refer back to my previous post w/ the jsfiddle link, it had exactly what you needed to putâ€¦ you removed part of it
[13:25:19] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/jShst/4/
[13:25:29] <Bloomberg> See, there show you an error
[13:25:45] <Bloomberg> [Object object]
[13:26:13] <recognosco> Krinkle: http://pastebin.com/P5KjtccY -- when i try: node tests/javascript/testrunner.js -- i get this error: ReferenceError: sample_echo is not defined
[13:26:35] <Velveeta> bloomberg: what error
[13:26:43] <Velveeta> [Object object] is not an error
[13:27:13] <Bloomberg> but isn't getting the values
[13:27:19] <Velveeta> it absolutely is
[13:27:58] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/jShst/3/ <-- there's an example with a console.log of what it's getting
[13:28:16] <Velveeta> it's getting an array of all of your input elements' values, which is what you said you needed
[13:28:42] <Velveeta> now, you may need to assign that to a variable name to send to the server
[13:29:13] <Velveeta> for instance, you can't just transmit an array of data with no key, that just violates html in general
[13:29:21] <Velveeta> er http
[13:29:37] <recognosco> Krinkle: any idea why is that happening?
[13:31:11] <Krinkle> recognosco: yes
[13:31:35] <Krinkle> recognosco: Have you worked with nodejs in the past?
[13:31:49] <recognosco> Krinkle: first time.
[13:32:22] <Krinkle> recognosco: There is no global scope leakage like in browsers (e.g. when you define a variable in a file, it doens't automatically become a global variable property of a "window" object)
[13:32:48] <Krinkle> recognosco: each file has its own private scope, if you want to share an interface, you need to export it.
[13:33:30] <Krinkle> See my boilerplate example repository for how to make this less of a problem.
[13:33:53] <Krinkle> recognosco: btw, are you testing a nodejs application or a browser script?
[13:34:35] <Krinkle> If you just want to test a browser script, you probably shouldn't use the nodejs qunit package to run the tests. That'll probably break because there is no browser attached to the tests.
[13:35:20] <Krinkle> recognosco: In that case you'll probably want to use grunt (a nodejs application) and grunt-contrib-qunit (a grunt plugin that runs the tests in a hidden but real browser, phantomjs).
[13:35:32] <recognosco> Krinkle: so using something like PhantomJS is a better idea?
[13:35:35] <Krinkle> Yep
[13:35:57] <Krinkle> then you won't be dealing with nodejs and exports within the test suite or your application, only in the little Grunt setup file.
[13:36:21] <Krinkle> https://github.com/Krinkle/travis-ci-node-and-browser-qunit and follow the instructions at the bottom for removing the nodejs stuff.
[13:36:31] <Krinkle> That remains is a Gruntfile.js setup for testing qunit in phantomjs.
[13:36:36] <Krinkle> What*
[13:37:40] <recognosco> Krinkle: now i am starting to get it. thanks a lot for explaining it so nicely.
[13:37:50] <Krinkle> you're welcome!
[13:47:36] <archfool> heh.. got it.  the .trigger('create'); has to be inside the load('page', function(){})
[13:52:25] <Velveeta> oh that's weird
[13:52:34] <patchy> there's something wrong with the function here :P --> 	$(root).find("img[src='wikipedia.png']").function(){
[13:52:45] <patchy> guess this will be easy for you guy's..
[13:53:01] <Velveeta> what is $(root)?
[13:53:14] <patchy> isnt that the root of the document?
[13:53:31] <Velveeta> nope, you should probably use $('body') or $(document)
[13:53:41] <Velveeta> or $(window) maybe?
[13:53:53] <patchy> this tutorial uses root --> http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-xpathjquery/
[13:54:17] <Velveeta> that tutorial is using an xml document instead of html
[13:54:33] <patchy> ahh, ok
[13:54:41] <patchy> i will change it to body then :) thanks
[13:54:46] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:55:02] <patchy> but i think i have one more error there..
[13:55:14] <patchy> i dont think it should be .function...
[13:55:26] <Velveeta> stupid colloquy
[13:55:34] <patchy> it should be like .(function ***) or smething
[13:55:49] <patchy> i dont think it should be .function...
[13:56:05] <patchy> my code: $(root).find("img[src='wikipedia.png']").function(){
[13:56:12] <Velveeta> oh yeah, that too
[13:56:23] <Velveeta> it depends on what function you're trying to use
[13:56:36] <Velveeta> .show, .hide, .each, .css, etc?
[13:56:46] <patchy> i wanna change the src to another url
[13:56:48] <Atlantic777> Hi there! I'm have an array of strings and I want to create corresponding buttons but every button should have different handler when it's clicked. That handler should be generated with name of that button. I mean, if I have following array ['place 1', 'place 2', 'place 3'], I need to create 3 buttons with handlers for triggerng an ajax request for urls like '/api/something/place_X/'
[13:56:55] <Atlantic777> I'm not sure how to do this... Any hints?
[13:57:31] <Atlantic777> I have forEach() on array and I've done button creating thing, but I'm stuck on assigning and creating those handlers for ajax requests.
[13:57:54] <Atlantic777> Thanks, I know there's some good soul willing to help me with this. :D
[13:58:05] <patchy> Velveeta: i havent found the function yet :P so..
[13:58:52] <Velveeta> patchy: use .attr and pass your function to it
[13:59:10] <Velveeta> your.chain.attr('src', newSrc)
[13:59:37] <patchy> aha, will check that out! thanks
[14:00:07] <Velveeta> atlantic: to bind up a separate function for each of those buttons is pretty wasteful, you can do that same behavior with a single function...
[14:00:48] <BillCriswell> Atlantic777: You can do like... $.each( buttons, function(idx,val){ var $button = $('<button>').text(val); $button.on('click', function(){ $.get( '/api/something/' + val, function(){ console.log('YEAHHHH') }); });
[14:01:05] <Atlantic777> Velveeta: that's great, but I don't have idea how. Can you give me a link or at least a keyword what to look for?
[14:01:06] <BillCriswell> Well... $button.appendTo('somejawn')
[14:01:17] <Atlantic777> BillCriswell: thanks, give me a moment parse it. :D
[14:01:29] <BillCriswell> What Velveeta's way makes more sense I'm sure.
[14:01:54] <Velveeta> i'll whip up a jsfiddle
[14:02:19] <BillCriswell> You can just do like... <button data-place="place 1">Hello</button> then do $('button').on('click', function(){ $.get( $(this).data('place') ); }) });
[14:03:09] <t0th_-> hi
[14:03:12] <t0th_-> jquerymobile ?
[14:05:08] <patchy> Velveeta: will this be the correct syntax? 	$(body).find("img[src='wikipedia.png']").attr("src", "http://www.marietta.edu/News/images/Wikipedia-logo-small.gif");
[14:07:04] <culh> $('body')
[14:07:18] <patchy> ohh..yeah
[14:07:25] <BillCriswell> I just waited for this sites loading screen, it ended.. then it shows me the site and I can clearly see everything being loaded.
[14:08:23] <patchy> IT WORKS :D my absolute first javascript!...
[14:08:46] <Velveeta> atlantic777: look at this demo: http://jsfiddle.net/WvGtL/
[14:08:55] <patchy> also my first tampermonkey script..at the same time..hehe
[14:09:06] <culh> that's jq, not pure JS. Try doing the same with pure JS and see how long it'll take to build a cross-browser code :S
[14:09:19] <Velveeta> lol
[14:10:09] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Do you use iTunes?
[14:10:35] <Velveeta> these days i mostly just use spotify :)
[14:10:41] <Velveeta> but yes, i do use itunes to manage my ipod stuff
[14:10:45] <Velveeta> for the road
[14:12:16] <BillCriswell> Think this is doable with just CSS? Trying to do the album viewer thingie in iTunes for fun. http://jsbin.com/oHACope/3/edit?js,output
[14:12:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Just the sizing of the columns, obviously.
[14:13:03] <Velveeta> oh ok, i was like "wait, what is he trying to do here?" :D
[14:13:11] <Velveeta> ok let me take a look at what you're trying to do here
[14:13:55] <Velveeta> ok, so you're trying to have responsive column widths + column counts?
[14:13:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsbin.com/oHACope/4/edit stripped down haha.
[14:14:22] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, basically, for every 100 pixels I want to add a column. I want all the columns to be "equal" though.
[14:14:45] <BillCriswell> If 2 could fit, 50%, if 3 could fit: 33%, etc, etc
[14:14:51] <Velveeta> right
[14:15:03] <Velveeta> is there a max on the column count?
[14:15:08] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Nope.
[14:15:09] <Velveeta> or just whatever your screen size will support?
[14:15:13] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[14:15:33] <Velveeta> then i don't think you can do that with just pure cssâ€¦ you could do it for a fixed column count with media breaks, but it'd be tedious and ugly
[14:15:38] <BillCriswell> I don't want to use JS for it but not sure I have a choice.
[14:15:48] <Velveeta> for N columns supported, i don't know that you could do it in pure css
[14:15:49] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, that's what I wanted to avoid.
[14:15:55] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Dang.
[14:17:15] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/owekOYa/6/edit guess that's good enough for now.
[14:18:21] <Atlantic777> Velveeta: duh, this looks like what I need! Thanks! So, there I should just add success function handler/callback in $.ajax block, and that should be it?
[14:18:43] <Velveeta> yepyep
[14:19:04] <BillCriswell> Next I need to figure out the best way to get to the end of the "row" so I can insert the little album view. Guess I could just look at the width of the element and do the math based on that.
[14:20:34] <Velveeta> yeah
[14:20:58] <jphase> hehe, excellent irc nick Velveeta
[14:21:10] <Velveeta> jphase: thanks, i own the twitter handle too ;)
[14:21:11] <jphase> salty yellow goodness
[14:23:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I see you're a Kevin Hart fan.
[14:23:49] <Velveeta> that dude cracks me up like nobody has in a long time :D
[14:24:04] <BillCriswell> People from Philly tend to be awesome.
[14:24:09] <jphase> I like louis ck too, he's pretty dope
[14:24:16] <Velveeta> yeah he's pretty funny too
[14:24:27] <Velveeta> i think carlin's still my favorite ever, but that's a whole different style of comedy
[14:24:46] <jphase> yeah, hard to compete with georgie
[14:24:47] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Agreed. Pryor is a close second.
[14:25:30] <Velveeta> yeah pryor was awesome, and i love hearing eddie murphy do his impressions of bill cosby *and* richard pryor when he's talking about the call he got from bill one day
[14:26:16] <BillCriswell> Murphy is another genius.
[14:26:41] <BillCriswell> My favorite comedians are primarily black.
[14:26:47] <Velveeta> heheheheh yeah
[14:26:55] <Velveeta> yeah this is one of my favorite bits ever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYfenUt0u9A
[14:27:33] <quadHlx> Hello everyone.  I am using cakephp and am trying to create a modal dialog box.  The dialog will display when the button is clicked, however, after 3-4 seconds the dialog closes (without user intervention).  Is there a `trick` to keeping my modal open?
[14:28:29] <Velveeta> quadhix: it should stay open indefinitely unless something external is closing it
[14:28:57] <quadHlx> When I click the button to open the dialog, my URL at the bottom says "waiting for <myip>"
[14:29:02] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ever heard of Hannibal Buress? Pretty funny dude. More dead pan than Murphy, Pryor, Rock and Hart but still great.
[14:29:13] <quadHlx> I think it is a cake thing... :(
[14:29:22] <quadHlx> ty Velveeta
[14:30:05] <Velveeta> quadhix: cake may be autogenerating something that's causing it to closeâ€¦ you might try adding a close option to it that does a console.trace() so you can try to see where it's coming from
[14:30:17] <Velveeta> quadhix: ohhhhhh i just saw your previous comment
[14:30:35] <Velveeta> er wait, maybe nevermind
[14:31:08] <Velveeta> is your dialog loading in something from an ajax request?
[14:31:27] <Velveeta> because it would seem that if it's "waiting for <myip>" that something is trying to navigate away from your page
[14:31:41] <quadHlx> Velveeta, no it is simply displaying a <div>
[14:32:11] <Velveeta> is that dialog open wired to an anchor tag or something?
[14:32:26] <Velveeta> an even better question might be: is this actually up somewhere that we can see it?
[14:32:47] <quadHlx> I set the autoOpen: false on the div ID
[14:32:49] <quadHlx> !bin
[14:33:51] <jnhghy_> I'm trying to use jQuery UI to display some images as tooltips, the issue that I have I can't make the tooltip stay in the screen (is folding beneath) on first hover, the 2nd hover and so on are ok, any idea why?
[14:35:18] <quadHlx> Velveeta, here is a paste: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/6702423
[14:35:48] <quadHlx> I pretty much just copied and pasted from a tutorial.  I am not super jquery savvy
[14:38:21] <Velveeta> quadfix: looks like you're rendering that as an anchor that's styled w/ bootstrap to look like a button
[14:38:31] <quadHlx> correct
[14:38:45] <quadHlx> I guess I could have volunteered that info :
[14:38:57] <Velveeta> might want to inspect that element and make sure there's something that'll prevent the page from navigating
[14:39:09] <Velveeta> otherwise it may just reload the current page, looking like the dialog is just closing
[14:39:09] <jnhghy_> why is jquery ui loading my tooltip in different place for 2nd, 3rd and so on vs 1st hover?
[14:39:43] <quadHlx> `something that'll prevent the page from navigating`  --> do you have a google'able term for this thing? :)
[14:39:45] <Velveeta> jnhghy_: sounds like there's some positioning magic going on that has it opening relative to something else each time, maybe relative to its previous location
[14:40:12] <Velveeta> quadhix: well, a click handler that would prevent it, or an href of something like javascript:void(0);
[14:40:30] <Velveeta> or you could not use Html->link but rather Html->button or something instead
[14:40:31] <quadHlx> ty much Velveeta im off to the drawing board.
[14:40:38] <quadHlx> ohhh
[14:41:02] <Velveeta> the end result should be the same, launching the modal, but buttons don't try to autonavigate the page
[14:41:22] <Velveeta> but make sure you specify it as button type="button", some browsers will make the default type submit if type isn't specified
[14:41:40] <quadHlx> ok ty very very much, I should have enough to figure this out now!
[14:41:46] <Velveeta> no problem, good luck
[14:42:13] <Velveeta> and on that note, i have some rush hour traffic to go play in, be back in a couple hours
[14:44:41] <BillCriswell> Be careful!
[14:45:52] <quadHlx> Using the HTML button worked Velveeta, ty again.
[14:46:00] <Velveeta> sweet, good to hear :)
[14:46:08] <Velveeta> and now i'm *actually* outta here :)
[14:47:37] <jnhghy_> Velveeta: thanks, now is working :)
[15:00:43] <jned> so if you do $("#some-html-elements-id").click(function(){...} you would say you are "binding" an event handler function?
[15:04:04] <jned> so if I want to use unbind, and I have to change my .click(function(){...}); to .bind('click', function(){...});
[15:04:39] <jphase> click is an alias to bind the click event yeah
[15:04:45] <jphase> oh no
[15:04:51] <jphase> you can just unbind
[15:05:14] <jned> jphase, thx
[15:05:21] <jphase> np
[15:05:48] <jned> so $("#foo").click(function(){... then $("#foo").unbind("click"); will do it?
[15:05:54] <jphase> should yeah
[15:06:13] <jned> or just .bind() and it will remove all handlers
[15:06:20] <jned> sorry unbind();
[15:06:28] <jphase> yeah
[15:06:37] <jned> I don't have to specify the event type, unless I have multiple
[15:06:42] <jned> and I one keep one,
[15:06:51] <jphase> mhm :]
[15:06:52] <jned> Ok great, thanks a lot jphase
[15:06:59] <jphase> sure
[15:07:35] <jphase> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yq3QIx8CG34/Tc8KcFnBGJI/AAAAAAAABnQ/VZO2DyH1IA0/s1600/penis1.jpg.crop_display.jpg
[15:07:38] <jphase> LMFAO
[15:07:57] <jned> but if I remove the html element, say $("#foo").remove(); then unbind won't do anything, cause its gone ofcourse
[15:08:07] <jphase> yeah
[15:08:23] <jned> elephant dick?
[15:08:38] <jphase> I have no idea
[15:08:40] <jphase> but quite hilarious
[15:08:47] <jonclark> Learning to use deferreds to control callbacks after xhr requests. What's the best way to get a script to throw an error so the .fail() deferred gets called? Is it reserved for cases when the server is unreachable or should I be manually sending back different HTTP status codes even though the request was OK but something in that script failed and I want to send back a failure?
[15:09:52] <jphase> jonclark: check out the first answer on this post:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10843297/throwing-an-error-in-jquerys-deferred-object
[15:10:27] <jonclark> Sorry if that was easily findable
[15:10:34] <jonclark> I did some googling with no luck. will read :)
[15:10:45] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/3/edit -- anybody know how to replace jQuery Mobile's loader with https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress/?
[15:13:17] <jonclark> jphase, if you have a sec..
[15:13:43] <jonclark> in that answer, i see this function call to hasError(), I assume that would be some user-defined function that checks the content of the response?
[15:14:10] <jnhghy_> jquery ui tooltip triggers correct only starting from 2nd hover, 1st hover doesn't load the correct image size and position, any idea?
[15:15:53] <jphase> jonclark: yeah, that'd be custom
[15:15:58] <jonclark> kk
[15:18:33] <idiocrash> hi sirs
[15:18:41] <ngharo> boytoy: it looks like you can just drop it in and call NProgress.start() and NProgress.done() in replacement of $.mobile.loading('hide/show')
[15:21:52] <idiocrash> If someone would be so kind
[15:22:00] <idiocrash> I think I have an easy fix, but I'm not seeing it just yet
[15:22:03] <idiocrash> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/YKRajv9B
[15:22:07] <idiocrash> super simple
[15:22:26] <idiocrash> my problem is that it seems I don't get the full result back from my ajax request
[15:22:45] <idiocrash> the ajax handler script is supposed to return a complete html table
[15:22:55] <idiocrash> but I only seem to be getting the header row back
[15:22:59] <no_gravity> Good Evening from Germany! Im looking into typeahead libraries right now. The one from bootstrap looks nice. Im just not sure if i can use it without loading all of bootstrap?
[15:23:13] <idiocrash> how do I get the request to wait for the .php script to return everything?
[15:23:23] <boytoy> ngharo: interesting
[15:23:36] <jnhghy_> any reason for jquery ui colission not triggering at first hover?
[15:24:17] <ngharo> boytoy: http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/6/edit i can't figure out how to completely stop the jqm loader (why i call hide there)
[15:24:33] <ngharo> boytoy: perhaps you could specify a theme that has display:none
[15:25:19] <jonclark> jphase, thanks for that, got it working :)
[15:25:28] <boytoy> ngharo: wow this is so cool man
[15:25:37] <boytoy> thanks for showing me the way
[15:25:45] <jphase> np jon
[15:25:48] <ngharo> idiocrash: the callback only fires when the remote side returns..
[15:26:01] <boytoy> ngharo: yeah actually i dont use themes, just the clean structure
[15:26:31] <idiocrash> ngharo: so you think there's no complete result being returned?
[15:26:37] <boytoy> ngharo: lemme update your fiddle with no theme though, one sec
[15:26:43] <ngharo> idiocrash: yes
[15:27:07] <idiocrash> k, i'll check that
[15:32:33] <boytoy> ngharo: probably gotta do the hiding regardless -- http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/8 -- but no doubt it looks better without any themes
[15:33:13] <boytoy> god that is pretty
[15:33:35] <boytoy> a million bucks right there..
[15:33:49] * boytoy sends a couple of girls over to ngharo to show his appreciation
[15:34:22] <ngharo> boytoy: oh its the script in your html that is showing the jqm loader
[15:34:40] <ngharo> take that stuff out and you no longer have to hide it manually
[15:35:35] <boytoy> oh right yeah
[15:35:57] <boytoy> just copied that one from the docs
[15:36:44] <boytoy> yes indeed: http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/10
[15:36:47] * boytoy is in love :p
[16:03:01] <nhulea> how come this only displays the last one ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/uQau4/
[16:03:07] <nhulea> thanks
[16:03:15] <nhulea> the last in the array
[16:03:27] <nhulea> I wanted to spit out all of them
[16:03:33] <rgr> what's the best way to simplify/optimise the following jquery selector? $(".notmobilemode.normalmode  .nowon,.notmobilemode.normalmode  .today, .notmobilemode.normalmode .tomorrow") - the common it being the .notmobilemode.normalmode part. Select on them and then find with the other 3 classes?
[16:03:52] <pixelpimp> that is super specific to your CSS
[16:04:21] <nhulea> does any one see what I mean ?
[16:05:00] <pixelpimp> you may be able to use siblings of one of the classes, assuming they're all next to each other
[16:10:53] <fr0ggie>   /win 19
[16:11:00] <fr0ggie> fail
[16:27:29] <hazardous> i have a potentially weird or strange question
[16:27:40] <hazardous> is there a simple way to detect, say, a light background on a selector
[16:27:45] <hazardous> and then change the text css 'color: xxx' to black
[16:27:49] <hazardous> or the reverse
[16:30:47] <pixelpimp> with some math, sure
[17:10:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> hazardous: well you would probably want to work in rgb
[17:10:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> hazardous: instead of using hex
[17:10:45] <pixelpimp> two forms of the same thing
[17:12:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hazardous: you can google it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4726344/how-do-i-change-text-color-determined-by-the-background-color
[17:13:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> unfortunately that will invert colors
[17:14:02] <pixelpimp> odd math is odd; bit shifting is easier
[17:14:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[17:15:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> hazardous: found it http://jsfiddle.net/QkSva/

[17:26:19] <doug65536> can I trust jquery to process data attribute selectors properly (looking at data cache instead of actual attributes)?
[17:27:27] <doug65536> I noticed that data changes don't affect the actual attribute, which made me wary of doing something like $('li[data-foo=123]')
[17:28:17] <doug65536> I suppose I should just make a test case...
[17:31:10] <idiocrash> hi guise!
[17:31:27] <lindseyr> doug: data attributes don't get updated w/ calls to .data() in my experience
[17:31:27] <idiocrash> I want to load some HTML returned from a PHP script into a modal popup
[17:31:47] <lindseyr> you have to update both the .data() and the .attr() version of it to keep them in sync if you want that
[17:32:03] <idiocrash> let's say I have my HTML in a JS variable
[17:32:19] <idiocrash> how can I pass it to a modal popup?
[17:32:42] <lindseyr> holy crap i finally beat the issue that's been a pain in my ass for 3 days now
[17:32:56] <lindseyr> idiocrash: it depends on how your modal popup is implemented
[17:33:12] <idiocrash> I'm using http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/
[17:34:29] <BillCriswell> idiocrash: You can feed that a string directly.
[17:34:35] <BillCriswell> $.modal( htmlString );
[17:34:39] <idiocrash> oh damn
[17:34:49] <idiocrash> I'll try that now. Thanks!
[17:34:50] <idiocrash> :)
[17:34:54] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[17:39:55] <doug65536> confirmed, data attribute selectors don't work: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AxSaU/4/
[17:40:20] <doug65536> i.e. they don't lookaside at the jquery data cache
[17:40:37] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Ah, got it.
[17:40:42] <BillCriswell> I was confused for a second.
[17:46:54] <BillCriswell> Silly internet.
[18:12:29] <__machine> i am trying to do a cross domain POST request... first i need to obtain a csrftoken from a cookie set by the remote domain by doing a GET request on the remote page... i do $.get(url, function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {...}) ... inside the callback, how do i access the csrftoken cookie?
[18:14:28] <jphase> __machine: try this http://avinmathew.com/adding-csrf-token-to-jquery-ajax-requests/
[18:16:25] <jphase> the important line is xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', csrf_token);
[18:17:25] <__machine> jphase: thats setting a csrf token header before making a request... i dont have a csrftoken to set... i need to obtain a csrftoken first (and probably cache it) by making a GET request against the remote domain, and the remote domain will send a response which sets a csrftoken cookie... i want to read that cookie and cache it so i can set it on subsequent POST requests
[18:17:35] <jphase> oh
[18:18:16] <jphase> I'm not entirely sure, have you tried console logging your 3 variables in the response?
[18:19:58] <__machine> yes i looked at jqXHR and i couldnt see any cookie data or the actual raw response or response headers anywhere... data is the body of the response (HTML) and jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() only returns "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8"
[18:21:00] <jphase> that's just the headers though
[18:21:10] <jphase> you tried jqXHR.responseText
[18:21:13] <jphase> or what-not?
[18:22:03] <__machine> yes, it is the response body (HTML) ... doesnt include the raw response (headers and cookies etc)
[18:22:15] <jphase> hmm
[18:26:39] <jphase> __machine: how is your token generated on the server side?
[18:27:18] <__machine> django framework sets a csrftoken cookie on the response headers
[18:27:30] <jphase> ahh, okay well that's not the problem then...
[18:27:31] <jphase> hmm
[18:27:43] <jphase> you should definitely at least be getting an HTTP response code on that return
[18:28:32] <__machine> jqXHR.status is 200
[18:29:47] <jphase> well that's good then...
[18:30:21] <jphase> http://pastebin.ws/fdwekh
[18:30:27] <jphase> does that snippet shed any light?
[18:30:47] <jphase> specifically the getCookie() function
[18:32:19] <__machine> it appears to be accessing document.cookie which will be the cookies for the local domain, on the page i am viewing in the browser which is making the ajax request to the remote domain... i need to access the cookie set by the remote domain (not available in document.cookie)
[18:33:34] <jphase> well here's some documentation from django, which is where I got that from: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/csrf/#ajax
[18:34:09] <jphase> you might need to include some encoded cookie data in your response on the server side, but I don't know a whole lot about django to be honest
[18:34:42] <__machine> i think the django docs only talk about getting the cookie from local domain responses and making ajax requests to the same origin... not cross domain requests...
[18:35:28] <jphase> __machine: you're controlling the body of your response right?
[18:36:01] <__machine> yes... i could include the csrftoken in the HTML output and scape it...
[18:37:03] <jphase> __machine: and you have Access-Control-Allow_Origin and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing implemented?
[18:38:08] <__machine> yes i have set the cors headers on the response on the remote domain... without those i get warnings about different origin not being allowed
[18:41:20] <jphase> this guy  generates his token using hmac-sha1() and base64():   http://s2.diffuse.it/blog/show/14883-Sessionless_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery_protection_with_jQuery
[18:41:33] <jphase> seems to be what you're trying to do I think
[18:44:51] <__machine> i can view the response in chrome's inspector and it includes a response header... Set-Cookie: csrftoken=blahblah; ... but i just cant see that in the jqXHR in my jquery code...
[18:50:13] <jphase> hmmm
[18:51:49] <jphase> it's odd that your network tab shows the headers you need but getAllResponseHeaders doesn't contain them...
[18:52:29] <__machine> jphase: yes i thought so... the only header in getAllResponseHeaders() is Content-Type
[18:53:30] <jphase> I mean, normally I'd say try xhr.getResponseHeader('Set-Cookie') but if it's not included in the getAllResponseHeaders() method than I doubt that will help
[18:55:23] <__machine> my response also has Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true ... and my request XHR has withCredentials=true ... so i should be getting cookies
[18:55:39] <__machine> yeah i tried that... i get null back
[18:55:43] <jphase> bah
[18:56:01] <jphase> The way you describe your network tab sounds like you're doing everything perfectly correct
[18:57:33] <jphase> shoky or someone that is > me might know but you have me officially stumped :[
[19:00:29] <jphase> and this is via GET?
[19:00:52] <jphase> oh POST, okay
[19:00:53] <jphase> hmm
[19:01:54] <hadees> I have a function that runs on a jquery click even like so $(".fulfillment-boxes").on('click', function() { â€¦ }) but is there an event I can also add to on so that it'll run function once at the start? I'm creating checkboxes that toggle visibility of parts of my site and I'd like to have that code handle the initial state too
[19:02:20] <hadees> adding ready or load doesn't seem to do it
[19:03:03] <__machine> jphase: i am using GET from localdomain to remotedomain trying to read the csrftoken... so that i can then include the csrftoken with subsequent POST requests
[19:03:04] <jphase> hadees: you can put your function in doc ready
[19:03:19] <jphase> it should work unless you're doing something dynamic
[19:03:46] <jphase> oic
[19:04:44] <jphase> __machine: do you have a live URL for this?
[19:04:53] <HarryPitfall> hadees: you can use triggerHandler()
[19:04:56] <hadees> jphase: it is dynamic, i thought about doing that though, and if I can't find a better way I will but it seems like there should be a way to just run it once and then run the code again on clicks
[19:05:21] <CuDi> hey guys, how come my .each isn't working using a Defined function? $.each(persons, fillPerson(index, value));
[19:05:27] <HarryPitfall> $('.fulfillment-boxes').find('the_selector_for_dynamic').triggerHandler('click');
[19:05:29] <CuDi> "index" is not defined error
[19:05:46] <jphase> CuDi: your function might not be returning an array or object properly
[19:05:54] <HarryPitfall> I believe that you just want to run the code at all :3
[19:06:28] <hadees> HarryPitfall: hmm i guess that would work, i tried trigger but I didn't actually want to change the checkbox
[19:06:40] <lindseyr> cudi: you have to invoke it differently to use a defined function like that, i'm assuming fillPerson is your defined function?
[19:06:46] <CuDi> yes
[19:06:55] <jphase> ahh, I see what you're trying to do there
[19:06:56] <CuDi> can you direct me to documentation on how to use Defined functions in Jquery callbacks?
[19:07:01] <jphase> use the index of the .each in your params
[19:07:11] <lindseyr> cudi: try something like this: $.each.call(this, persons, fillPerson)
[19:07:29] <lindseyr> er, actually, scratch that
[19:07:37] <CuDi> oh okay
[19:07:39] <lindseyr> you could just call it like this: $.each(persons, fillPerson)
[19:07:47] <CuDi> and it will pass index value auto?
[19:07:58] <lindseyr> but don't specify the parameters inline there, your function expression should already have its parameter list defined
[19:08:11] <lindseyr> it will pass index and value automatically, yes
[19:08:17] <lindseyr> it's up to your function to receive and use them properly
[19:08:32] <jphase> that's neat lindseyr, haven't used that b4
[19:08:33] <CuDi> gotcha
[19:08:41] <jphase> :D
[19:08:41] <CuDi> cool lindseyr trying
[19:08:43] <lindseyr> jphase: which one?
[19:08:49] <CuDi> win
[19:08:50] <jphase> just chaining .call right after
[19:08:55] <lindseyr> oh damnit, it has my wrong name in here again, wtf
[19:08:57] <jphase> where it automatically passes off the .each params
[19:09:02] <CuDi> lol
[19:09:04] <Velveeta> :D
[19:09:07] <CuDi> I have a velvet jacket
[19:09:12] <jphase> ahhh, it's you!
[19:09:14] <__machine> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/H3kbJ/
[19:09:14] <CuDi> is velveeta similar
[19:09:16] <Velveeta> tis i!
[19:09:27] <Velveeta> cudi: not quite, velvet !== velveeta :D
[19:11:15] <jphase> A Velveeta jacket would be pretty cool though...
[19:11:25] <jphase> wouldn't last in the summer days, but the winter would be delightful
[19:11:36] <Velveeta> certainly wouldn't last here in austin :D
[19:11:43] <jphase> oo yikes
[19:12:01] <Velveeta> this year was pretty mild, i think we only had like 40something 100+ degree days
[19:12:10] <jphase> __machine: so odd, it definitely looks like it's supposed to be fine
[19:12:18] <Velveeta> a couple years ago, we had 90 of em, that was an insane year
[19:12:29] <jphase> Velveeta: perhaps you might know about __machine's problem, I'm stumped
[19:12:33] <CuDi> well this is embarassing.
[19:12:46] <CuDi> my fillPerson function is firing now, but the second parameter from each, is undefined?
[19:12:56] <jphase> his response headers look fine in network tab but won't come back with xhr.getAllResponseHeaders()
[19:13:03] <jphase> only comes back with Content-Type
[19:13:12] <Velveeta> cudi: how are you calling it?
[19:13:37] <CuDi> http://pastebin.com/tHjYxW6g
[19:14:24] <jned> if I call some blog data from a db, and add it to a page using .append(), can I calculate the vertical size on the page, so I can decide weather to continue posting to current page?
[19:14:41] <CuDi> actually nevermind i think i had the property case name wrong
[19:14:54] <jphase> jned: yeah, .height() should help you
[19:15:01] <jned> jphase, thx
[19:15:11] <Velveeta> cudi: also, you're making your array 1-indexed vs 0-indexed
[19:15:19] <CuDi> i see
[19:15:22] <CuDi> but i thought that wouldnt be ap roblem?
[19:15:24] <Velveeta> so on the first iteration of your $.each loop, the value will be undefined
[19:15:30] <CuDi> i thought EACH will just iterate whats in the array.
[19:15:37] <CuDi> in PHP it would. but i guess JS diff?
[19:15:54] <Velveeta> $.each typechecks the data type so it knows whether to use for-in or for to iterate over it
[19:16:10] <Velveeta> for an array, it most likely does a for i = 0; i < array.length; i++ kind of iteration
[19:16:34] <CuDi> i see.
[19:16:39] <CuDi> so i have to stop indexing manually
[19:16:43] <CuDi> interesting
[19:16:46] <Velveeta> rather than statically assigning your index values, you should just push onto them, persons.push(data.PrimaryContact)
[19:16:49] <CuDi> doesnt this kind of defeat the person of each?
[19:16:56] <CuDi> purpose*
[19:16:57] <CuDi> of each
[19:16:58] <Velveeta> orrrrr if you require 1 and 2 for index values, use an object literal
[19:17:03] <Velveeta> not at all
[19:17:25] <Velveeta> you're misusing an array type, it's not $.each's fault :D
[19:17:32] <CuDi> lolll
[19:17:36] <Velveeta> if you require index values of 1 and 2, make them keys on an object
[19:17:44] <jphase> __machine: what browser are you using out of curiosity?
[19:17:54] <Velveeta> and do persons['1'] = data.PrimaryContact
[19:17:58] <CuDi> oh yep, and then each will work just fine
[19:18:01] <Velveeta> and persons['2'] = data.SecondaryContent
[19:18:02] <CuDi> gotcha
[19:18:03] <Velveeta> right
[19:18:04] <__machine> jphase: chrome 29
[19:19:50] <__machine> jphase: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10014432/how-to-set-a-cookie-in-wcf-and-read-it-in-the-calling-ajaxs-success-function-o this page seems to indicate that Set-Cookie is explicitly excluded from getAllResponseHeaders(), and that the cookie data is copied by the browser *after* the success callback executes...
[19:19:59] <jphase> yeah
[19:20:04] <jphase> I'm reading about patches for that function
[19:36:43] <jphase> __machine: bah, trying to alter the ajaxSetup function to return the headers you need but having issues
[19:42:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys
[19:42:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have 2 arrays
[19:42:15] <juboba_> how can I load a partial view of my webpage changing the URL?
[19:42:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> now both arrays are the same length
[19:42:34] <juboba_> I mean, load the partial (I'm doing that) but also changing the url
[19:42:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lets name them a and b for exmaple purposes
[19:42:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> *exmaple
[19:42:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> *example
[19:42:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> so a and b are the same length
[19:43:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> and a's items correspond to b's items
[19:43:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning
[19:43:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> if the values of a are 1,2,3 and the values of b 231
[19:43:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> *2,3,1
[19:43:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> then what i wna to do is create a chain
[19:43:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> such that
[19:44:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1=>2=>3=>1
[19:44:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> so 2 arrays referencing each other
[19:44:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> obviously thats a simple example
[19:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i need to be able to do it for larger arrays
[19:45:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> when the b column is completely scrambled
[19:45:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *b array
[19:45:53] <jphase> __machine: have you looked into Access-Control-Expose-Headers?  http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header
[19:47:10] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: Are you wanting to build an associative array with this?
[19:47:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> nno
[19:47:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> just a string
[19:47:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to store it for soemthing
[19:48:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can make it an array after
[19:48:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> or if making an associative array would be easier than i can convert to string from there
[19:49:24] <__machine> jphase: i just tried that... but i think the fact that set-cookie is explicitly disallowed in the spec supercedes that...
[19:49:51] <jphase> oh, like they mention "Set-Cookie" as something you simply cannot access what-so-ever?
[19:50:21] <jphase> damn, that sort of implies this isn't possible then?
[19:50:46] <jphase> or can you return the value with a different header name?
[19:51:43] <__machine> jphase: i think so... http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-getresponseheader()-method ... one of the suggested work-arounds was on the back-end to assign the value of the cookie to a new custom header so that it can be accessed
[19:52:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphrase: i just need the algorithm i know ill probably need 1 nested for loop but i can't seem to do the manipulation properly
[19:53:22] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: it sounds like you need a recursive function
[19:53:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> well yes
[19:53:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was thinking foor loop for memory purposes
[19:53:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have heard while loops take alot of mem
[19:53:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> or more mem to correct
[19:54:21] <jphase> well recursive functions should just loop until a condition is met, so it shouldn't take up any additional memory if it's written correctly
[19:54:49] <jphase> interesting task you have there Rohan_Bhangui
[19:56:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay noted on the mem thing
[19:56:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have been trying to go at this problem for about 30 min
[19:57:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphrase: tbh i need to write the solution to my problem in php, but once a solution comes up i can probably get it to work for php
[19:57:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is to say: rewrite in php
[19:58:37] <jphase> was gonna say that your string looks phpish
[19:58:49] <jphase> are you wanting them to be comma delimited?
[19:58:58] <jphase> or 1=>2=>4 type thing?
[20:00:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> any delimeter is fine
[20:00:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> as long as i can use a preg_split or something similar in the end
[20:01:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> even explode for that matter (but i think preg_split is the fastest)
[20:08:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphrase: we could use 1 loop for assigning values to the array which holds the links (lets call it array c)
[20:08:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then use another loop inside to check for the last entry added whether it is in array b
[20:19:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphrase: stll there?
[20:21:34] <jphase> yeah, just eating some dinner real quick before I try writing this out
[20:21:56] <jphase> it's jphase btw, if you put an 'r' in it my chat client won't notify me ;]
[20:22:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya sry about that
[20:22:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> now i feel like shit
[20:22:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> for calling yu jphrase all this time
[20:22:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[20:24:06] <ilteris> can someone tell me difference between  BV = new $.BigVideo({forceAutoplay:isTouch}); vs.  BV = new BigVideo({forceAutoplay:isTouch});
[20:25:07] <jphase> haha all good
[20:25:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: probably not the place to ask but in php if i have a mixture of html and php in a file, are the variables global?
[20:26:00] <jphase> ilteris: the first one is a jQuery object method (in the jQuery namespace), second is not
[20:26:35] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: All PHP variables are in global namespace unless you define a namespace at the top of your document
[20:26:54] <jphase> well, actually that only applies to classes I think, can't remember
[20:26:54] <ilteris> jphase oh now I get it, BigVideo is a method of jquery object. dang. thanks.
[20:26:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: define a namespace?
[20:27:04] <jphase> yeah, like...
[20:27:13] <jphase> <?php   namespace my\namespace;
[20:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh okay
[20:27:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay cool
[20:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> so this tring that i want to create at the end
[20:28:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> *string
[20:28:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually
[20:28:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[20:28:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just answered my won question
[20:28:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> *own
[20:29:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: so as i was saying we might need a nested for loop and use a variable to store the last item added to array c
[20:30:12] <jphase> mk
[20:30:23] <jphase> let me write something out real quick and see if I can figure something out
[20:30:30] <__machine> can i pass a selector to $.get() to return a jquery object for the matching elements from a remote page?
[20:30:35] <jphase> finishing up my thai food now :)
[20:31:33] <jphase> __machine: hmm, what do you mean matching elements from remote page?
[20:31:40] <jphase> ohhhhh
[20:31:44] <jphase> yes, but not with .get
[20:32:02] <jphase> $('div#mydiv').load('http://google.com input');
[20:32:04] <jphase> ;)
[20:32:15] <jphase> that's a good way to cross domain load stuff
[20:32:25] <jphase> it of course requires the allow access origin stuff you already have setup
[20:32:28] <__machine> load... thats it... cool
[20:32:52] <jphase> yeah, you can pass remote selectors after the URL (input is the selector in the example above)
[20:34:50] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: so to confirm, you need to match the two arrays by key?
[20:35:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> not by key
[20:35:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> by the value
[20:35:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> so array a
[20:35:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> {1,2,3,4}
[20:35:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> array b
[20:35:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> {3,2,1,4}
[20:35:54] <jphase> k
[20:35:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> output:
[20:36:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ohld let me write this properly
[20:36:21] <jphase> yeah, give me 2 good arrays to try with, my brain is starting to tingle a bit
[20:36:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> okayhold
[20:36:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me do that
[20:36:50] <Velveeta> i'd like to see the sample output too
[20:36:58] <Velveeta> and then maybe i can get the brain tingles
[20:37:06] <jphase> heh
[20:37:29] <jphase> I rarely get to write recursive functions at work anymore, so many things are too simple there
[20:37:33] <jphase> I miss them :~(
[20:38:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:38:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> well hopefully i can solve that
[20:38:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay here it is
[20:38:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> the arrays plus smaple output
[20:39:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> a{1 2 3 4}
[20:39:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> b{3 1 4 2}
[20:39:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> output: 1=>3=>4=>2=>1 -or- c{1,3,4,2,1}  <-- the 1 on the end is optional it just tells me that there is a "wrap around"
[20:39:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: think of the numbers as assassins and targets
[20:39:29] <jphase> oh okay
[20:39:38] <Velveeta> i don't get the relationship there
[20:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> my exmaple
[20:39:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> about the assassins or the array stuff
[20:39:59] <Velveeta> the array relationships
[20:40:03] <jphase> so array b's key is the value of array 1
[20:40:09] <jphase> and it's recursive?
[20:40:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> im comparing the strings not the values themselves
[20:40:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> so how it works is
[20:40:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> in an assassin target exmaple
[20:40:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw 1,2,3,4 are people
[20:40:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[20:41:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 has target 3 who has target 4 who has target 2 who has target 1
[20:41:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> so each person is both a target and assassin
[20:41:35] <Velveeta> now i see it
[20:41:47] <jphase> oh okay
[20:41:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya sry numbers are confusing
[20:42:03] <Velveeta> i was told there would be no math
[20:42:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> their isnt
[20:42:18] <Velveeta> i never was much fer lernin n such
[20:42:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:42:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> there isnt math
[20:42:32] <Velveeta> i know
[20:42:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> just recursion
[20:42:34] <Velveeta> it's a joke
[20:42:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> ditto
[20:44:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> so obviously we would need 1 loop for assigning the values to the output array
[20:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then i figure another for loop for finding the next assassin who was a target
[20:45:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> am i on the right track?
[20:45:27] <jphase> heh, 1 sec
[20:48:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[20:48:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wnat thai food now
[20:48:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[20:50:17] <jphase> heh, it was noM
[20:50:33] <jphase> Portland is full of Thai food though, kind of starting to get sick of it

[20:51:11] <jphase> DAMN Velveeta
[20:51:15] <jphase> no fair you beat me!!
[20:51:18] <Velveeta> :D
[20:51:28] <Velveeta> that's why they pay me the medium-sized bucks
[20:51:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: take a crack at it anyways
[20:51:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> lets see
[20:51:46] <jphase> well my approach was going to be recursive
[20:51:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[20:52:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold let me confirm it work
[20:52:03] <jphase> and in php, but now I feel so less nerdy cause Velveeta is quick as crystal meth!
[20:52:07] <jphase> it works great
[20:52:11] <jphase> console looks good
[20:52:15] <Velveeta> the blue shit too
[20:52:20] <jphase> lol
[20:52:23] <jphase> breaking badass
[20:52:28] <jphase> see what I did there?
[20:52:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold
[20:52:28] <jphase> haha
[20:52:30] <Velveeta> oh my god i can't wait for sunday
[20:52:32] <jphase> double entendre
[20:52:36] <Velveeta> indeed
[20:52:37] <jphase> or however you spell that
[20:52:51] <Velveeta> that's correct, and i should know, because i was a 3rd grade spelling bee champion
[20:53:09] <Velveeta> i don't know how many times i've dropped that factoid in my lifetimeâ€¦ it should be on my tombstone
[20:53:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> ha
[20:54:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i new it
[20:54:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> or suspected so
[20:54:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/CFPdZ/5/
[20:54:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> watch what happens when i sue 7 numbers
[20:54:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> *use
[20:54:44] <jphase> still works good Rohan_Bhangui
[20:54:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> really?
[20:54:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> check my link
[20:54:59] <Velveeta> your 4 and 6 targets are orphans
[20:55:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[20:55:04] <jphase> oh I see
[20:55:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> :(
[20:55:07] <Velveeta> they don't link to anybody but themselves
[20:55:16] <jphase> yeah, so it still works well
[20:55:19] <jphase> just funny arrays
[20:55:22] <Velveeta> yepyp
[20:55:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[20:55:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> 4 and 6 are targets of each other
[20:55:58] <Velveeta> right
[20:56:03] <Velveeta> but nothing else targets either of them
[20:56:17] <Velveeta> there's no path to those targets
[20:57:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> well is there anyway to ensure that they have a path
[20:57:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> when im shuffling the items
[20:57:22] <Velveeta> only if you restructure your data
[20:57:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> well what i could do
[20:57:41] <Velveeta> given the rules of how you walk your arrays, your arrays have to conform to those same rules
[20:57:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> is that case is really rare
[20:57:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what ill do is check that all numbers exist in the string
[20:57:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> and if they dont
[20:58:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> then i re shuffle
[20:58:06] <Velveeta> then you'll have orphans like this case
[20:58:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[20:58:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> not as frequently
[20:58:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause when ever there is an orphan case it will shuffle
[20:58:45] <Velveeta> right
[20:59:12] <Velveeta> you should build some logic into your shuffling function to avoid constructing arrays that are invalid in the first place
[20:59:17] <mdev> any benefits of jquery classes?
[20:59:26] <Velveeta> mdev: define "jquery classes"
[20:59:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: are you familiar with php
[20:59:32] <mdev> index.mymethod
[20:59:36] <mdev> that sort of thing
[20:59:36] <Velveeta> dom class, or jquery function instances?
[20:59:43] <mdev> functions
[21:00:00] <Velveeta> do you mean javascript oop in general, or something specific to jquery?
[21:00:16] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: it's been close to 2 years, but i'm still fairly fluent in it, yes
[21:00:18] <mdev> i don't know what I mean, i'll google nevermind :p
[21:00:28] <Velveeta> lol
[21:00:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: thats okay your better than me
[21:00:48] <Velveeta> mdev: if you're asking about the benefits of javascript oop development in general, then yes
[21:00:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> pasted my php code in html sectioncheck it out
[21:00:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/CFPdZ/6/
[21:01:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: that link is for you too
[21:02:56] <jphase> hmm, array_intersect_assoc doesn't do the same thing we're doing here though, is that for orphans or something?
[21:02:58] <jphase> I'm confused
[21:03:30] <Velveeta> also, if both of those arrays contain all the values, but not in an order that's conducive to this algorithm, it's gonna stop shuffling and potentially leave orphans
[21:03:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so there are 2 conditions that need to be met for my output array:
[21:03:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[21:04:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> but output array must never have the same value for same key
[21:04:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> like in $assassin and $targets the 2nd value must not equal the same
[21:04:23] <Velveeta> what you want to do is shuffle the array and make sure that a[n] => b[n] != a[b[n]] => b[b[n]] or something
[21:04:29] <Velveeta> i'm not exactly sure of that notation
[21:04:46] <Velveeta> but what you want is to make sure that e.g. 3 => and 4 => 3 don't both exist simultaneously in the array
[21:04:49] <Velveeta> s
[21:04:53] <jphase> yeah that's right, but with $ signs in front for php
[21:05:07] * jphase <- captain obvious
[21:05:10] <Velveeta> lol
[21:06:46] <ilteris> man, grunt is quite nice I must say.
[21:06:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: yes
[21:06:54] <Velveeta> grunt is the MAN
[21:06:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> no orphans
[21:07:06] <jphase> yay grunt
[21:07:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and no same values for a certain index
[21:07:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> hence why im not just using shuffle()
[21:09:30] <Velveeta> you could build that logic into your shuffle function
[21:09:38] <Velveeta> and then just run it once anytime you need to :)
[21:09:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> well shuffle() is built in so
[21:09:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would ahve t look at php api to figure what they did
[21:10:13] <Velveeta> oh ok i thought that was a function of your own
[21:11:03] <mp19uy> hi, I'm very new to web programming and I'm doing some tests with jquery and json objects, I'm looking the way to read a json object from a file.js and put all tha info into divs, the thing is that this json object is very nested but isn't equally nested... some categories are more deeps than others. Anyone can give me a little help here?
[21:11:03] <jphase> just sorts array by rand()
[21:11:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[21:11:24] <jphase> JSON.stringify or $.parseJSON will probably work for you mp19uy
[21:11:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was thinking that jphase
[21:12:13] <Velveeta> jphase: this sounds like a perfect opportunity for you to write a recursive function!
[21:12:18] <Velveeta> but in js :D
[21:12:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[21:12:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry if i have deviated from js
[21:12:46] <Velveeta> as long as those json objects are consistently formatted, but N levels deep
[21:12:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> my intention is to solve a problem
[21:12:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> the formula
[21:12:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> code i can write
[21:13:10] <jphase> lol, nah Velveeta, you'll just beat me again
[21:13:12] <Velveeta> right, no, that comment was in regards to mp19uy's question
[21:13:33] <mp19uy> I was thinking about doing something recursive... but isn't some procedure around there that already does that kind of job?
[21:13:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: atleast take acrack at it
[21:13:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> *a crack
[21:13:38] <Velveeta> jphase: nah, i'm getting close to calling it a night :)
[21:14:34] <T13|needsCoffee> A night?  It's already morning!
[21:15:16] <mp19uy> It would be great if I can find some piece of code that does something similar to what I want to do, to use it as a guide at least
[21:15:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> T13|needsCoffee: its night here too
[21:16:38] <jphase> mp19uy: do you have an example of your json file?
[21:19:29] <mp19uy> yes here it is: http://pastebin.com/LBnYhwic
[21:20:08] <mp19uy> I'm confident the syntax is correct
[21:22:26] <jphase> hmmm
[21:22:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you still there or asleep?
[21:23:07] <Velveeta> it's gonna be hard to properly abstract that out into a recursive function
[21:23:15] <Velveeta> because those items aren't formatted consistently
[21:23:24] <Velveeta> i'm sleep..thinking
[21:24:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lo
[21:24:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> *lol pick one
[21:24:40] <Velveeta> mp19uy: in some cases you have objects in objects, which is fine, it shows a hierarchy, and in some cases, you have an array inside of an object with what looks like data to be used to construct an anchor tag line item, but in other cases, you have an object nested inside of an object with a string value vs object value, to be used to construct a link also
[21:24:41] <jphase> yeah
[21:24:57] <jphase> example:   the twitter and youtube sections
[21:25:00] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: what's up
[21:25:04] <jphase> they have no values so those should be an array []
[21:25:35] <Velveeta> and also the resources/links item near the bottom
[21:26:04] <jphase> yeah, listen to the cheese, he is Ã¼ber
[21:26:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:26:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> either you or jphrase need to help me figure this out
[21:26:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> its driving me nuts
[21:26:42] <jphase> heh, no we don't
[21:26:46] <jphase> ;)
[21:26:47] <Velveeta> lol
[21:26:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahaha
[21:26:55] <Velveeta> that sounds like what i say to my kid
[21:27:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:27:03] <jphase> hehe
[21:27:09] <Velveeta> "dad, you need to sign this" "no i don't, *you* need me to sign it"
[21:27:14] <jphase> lol
[21:27:28] <jphase> there goes their field trips...
[21:27:35] <mp19uy_> oh yes
[21:27:46] <Velveeta> they sure don't do as many of those as i remember doing when i was a kid
[21:27:47] <mp19uy_> i see what you mean
[21:27:58] <Velveeta> there have been a year or 2 in recent memory where i don't think he went on any
[21:28:03] <jphase> yeah I remember going to pointless places, like the egg factory
[21:28:08] <mp19uy_> but the rest is correct no?
[21:28:14] <jphase> my childhood was like a frickin' episode of sesame street
[21:28:24] <Velveeta> there is no real "correct" to define a json document, that's perfectly valid json
[21:28:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:28:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> my field trips were all to the pioneer village
[21:28:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> or like a conservation area
[21:28:47] <Velveeta> it's just the the format of that json is such that it's hard to abstract it out in a good way to form a recursive method of walking it
[21:28:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[21:28:57] <Velveeta> we went to "pioneer farms" when i was a kid
[21:28:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> moving right along
[21:29:02] <Velveeta> near christmas time
[21:29:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[21:29:37] <Velveeta> and we were dipping candles and were like "oh my parents are gonna love this" and they were like "what? you don't get to keep those, we need them to decorate our christmas trees"
[21:29:50] <Velveeta> and i was just thinking "wtf? we're just slave labor then?"
[21:29:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> we had multiple classes go on these pioneer trips and one time all the classes got candy except for ours
[21:29:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> *well mine
[21:29:58] <jphase> haha
[21:30:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> we got .....bread
[21:30:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> :(
[21:30:09] <Velveeta> lol
[21:30:22] <Velveeta> ok so yeah, back to your problem :D
[21:30:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[21:30:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> that was a nice detour
[21:31:40] <CuDi> how can i call a custom function with jquery each?
[21:31:50] <mp19uy_> so... the only way to "read" this and put it into an html doc, is a recursive function...
[21:31:57] <Velveeta> cudi: you just asked that question earlier this evening
[21:31:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> the main issue is figuring out how to keep a number from having the same key when its scrammbled vs. in order
[21:32:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:32:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> sharp as hell
[21:32:26] <CuDi> haha yeah i know but this is slightly different, before i was asking how to use a defined function with the default index,value params passed by .each. now Im asking, is it possible to pass MORE params into the defined function
[21:32:40] <Velveeta> mp19uy_: no, that's definitely not the only way, it's just the easiest way, if the json doc were formed in a conducive manner
[21:33:06] <Velveeta> cudi: you'd have to use a custom wrapper for your function
[21:33:24] <CuDi> any doco on that?
[21:34:10] <Velveeta> cudi: i can show you an example in a jsfiddle if you give me an example of what extra parameters you're trying to send
[21:34:36] <CuDi> similar to what i had before i just want to send say 1 more extra param, so   defined function    function abc ( index, value, extraParam)
[21:34:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeeta: when you get the time i still require assistance
[21:35:23] <mp19uy_> Ok, I understand. And another thing, I read that the "elements" in a json object aren't in order, so how do you order them if you want to? Or how you pick them to in a particular order?
[21:35:23] <CuDi> actually i just realized how to do it lol.
[21:35:31] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: i'm brainstorming yours in a separate subroutine right now :)
[21:35:40] <Velveeta> cudi: well there you go then :)
[21:35:51] <CuDi> $.each( data, function(index, value) { abc(index,value,'asdfasdf'); }
[21:36:00] <Velveeta> perfect
[21:36:01] <CuDi> is that the standard method people use?
[21:36:05] <CuDi> or is there another way
[21:36:17] <Velveeta> that would be the typical way, the one i was gonna advocate
[21:36:33] <CuDi> perfect thanks
[21:39:09] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: you could, if you manually constructed that 2nd array, you could store off pairs of numbers as you go, so that when you select from the remaining pool, you don't pick an invalid pair again, i'll fiddle up an example of what i mean
[21:39:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[21:39:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wnat to keep it as random as possible
[21:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> holdup
[21:40:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> i may have something
[21:40:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> what if we are approaching this the wrong way
[21:40:31] <Velveeta> ok good, because i'm starting to get that look that says it's time to close the laptop
[21:40:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not do the reverse
[21:40:41] <Velveeta> so i don't know how much longer i can play
[21:40:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> dw
[21:40:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> hopefully we will talk soon
[21:41:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> my solution is to create the string and then create the arrays
[21:41:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> but again the idea is to go from array to string
[21:48:37] <jphase> my god, it's so annoying when clients expect your shit to make toast
[21:50:14] <jphase> I created this CSV import/export tool that makes it retardedly easy for this client to manage their entire relational db with rows and columns (even if '," and other non-friendly CSV characters are in there) and they get bitchy when it refused to import because they changed the amount of columns...
[21:51:04] <jphase> I made it die with a message that says "Hmm... seems to be a problem with the amount of columns. I got 21 columns and was expecting 27"
[21:51:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:51:47] <jphase> due to the fact that it literally deletes, updates, inserts, and modifies relational everything in their db, so I figured I wouldn't just run delete transactions without being 100% certain of what they did to the data lol
[21:51:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> rule num1
[21:51:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> never trust user
[21:51:57] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: http://jsfiddle.net/AuNWD/7/
[21:51:58] <jphase> yeah, that's why it dies haha
[21:52:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta if you dont mind
[21:52:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> ohw does the sort work
[21:53:07] <jphase> same way shuffle() works it looks like
[21:53:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw isnt do while now only while
[21:53:12] <Velveeta> it creates an array of numTargets indexes and populates it 1 -> numTargets
[21:53:30] <jphase> there's both while and do while
[21:53:42] <jphase> or is that php?
[21:54:05] <Velveeta> then it loops through that array and picks a random number, checks to see if it's equal to the current number or equal to one that's been previously stashed in the reverse index, or chosen at all for another index, and if so, chooses another
[21:54:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> im pretty usre they have both
[21:54:07] * jphase looks at stash to determine if he is currently 1 bong rips too many
[21:54:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> but while is used more
[21:54:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: how did you do that
[21:54:27] <Velveeta> then it stashes the value and sticks it into a lookup object to map itself for future lookups to disqualify it
[21:54:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> the text rowhat ever
[21:54:38] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: /me farts
[21:54:44] <Velveeta> while and do while serve 2 different purposes
[21:54:52] * Rohan_Bhangui likey solution
[21:54:59] <Velveeta> you use a while loop when you want to loop if a condition is false, and until it's true
[21:55:11] <Velveeta> do while is used when you want to loop at least 1 time, until the condition is true
[21:55:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[21:55:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> intersting
[21:55:28] <Velveeta> we always want to execute a fetch of a random number at least once, so we use a do while
[21:55:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> i always thought while is like 2.0 verison of do while
[21:55:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[21:55:40] <Rohan_Bhangui>  interesting
[21:55:44] <Velveeta> :)
[21:56:45] <Velveeta> jphase: just give them a simple function called setNumberOfColumns that they can call into
[21:56:53] <Velveeta> and when they do, it tells them to get a real rdbms and stfu
[21:57:05] <jphase> hah
[21:57:24] <jphase> well the thing is, I actually grab the columns from the database and count the columns of each row of their CSV
[21:57:28] <jphase> if it's off, I say "WHOA THERE"
[21:57:36] <jphase> so there's really no excuse for them
[21:57:37] <jphase> lol
[21:57:53] <jphase> Just don't delete columns, clear them out ffs
[21:57:53] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangul: that snippet can still be optimized further also, but in a pinch, this should do it, and without crippling the system on resources
[21:58:24] <jphase> Velveeta: you're a node nerd too yes?
[21:58:45] <Velveeta> i haven't done a crapton of node work yet, but yes, i've written some stuff in it so far
[21:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: problem solved
[21:59:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> thank you very much
[21:59:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> you to jphrase
[22:00:11] * Rohan_Bhangui giving Velveeeta and jphase high five
[22:00:12] <jphase> I just sat here and complemented Velveeta, but you're welcome ;)
[22:00:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> but you took on the rpoblem first
[22:01:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: one last thing what does chosen do?
[22:01:45] <jphase> chosen is just an object in his example
[22:01:54] <jphase> look at line 3
[22:02:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> well what purpose does it serve
[22:02:13] <jphase> he's pushing object values onto the "chosen" object
[22:02:55] <Velveeta> it serves as a map of what's already been assigned
[22:02:59] <ivanoats> can I $('#do_this).load('an_image.jpg') ?
[22:03:06] <Velveeta> so we don't have to walk the arrays each time we're evaluatinga new value
[22:03:09] <jphase> ivanoats: you need the full path I believe
[22:03:18] <jphase> perhaps it works locally, I have honestly never tried
[22:03:19] <Velveeta> we simply pull a new value and check "has this already been assigned to this same index in reverse?"
[22:04:10] <Velveeta> btw, i copied and pasted that chunk into the original snippet, and outputted the length of 'output' along w/ the string chain of targets to make sure it was functioning as expected, and bumped numTargets up to 50 to stress it slightly
[22:04:20] <Velveeta> it looks to be behaving: http://jsfiddle.net/CFPdZ/8/
[22:04:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta it repeats
[22:05:22] <jphase> anyone ever used Cheerio?
[22:05:25] <Velveeta> actually i was just noticing that on my most recent refresh
[22:05:28] <ivanoats> jphase: thanks. looks like some kind of mime-type issue? screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/3b3M0L0u1E1W
[22:05:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[22:05:57] <jphase> ivanoats: ohhh, you're loading the content of the image itself
[22:05:59] <Velveeta> so yeah, there's still some tweaking that needs to be done to the function that sets up the targets apparently
[22:06:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[22:06:34] <ivanoats> jphase: oh, should I load a html snippet that has the img tag instead?
[22:06:43] <jphase> ivanoats: you wouldn't use .load for that, you'd just use like... $('<img>').prop('src', 'yourimage.jpg').appendTo('body'); sorta thing
[22:06:48] <ivanoats> cool
[22:07:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what part needs to be tweaked
[22:07:45] <jphase> ivanoats: you could use .load to load an img tag off of another site though, if the img tag is already there with the src you want
[22:08:12] <Velveeta> not exactly sure, walking those arrays and that target chain visually, they look fine on the surface, so i'm not sure how *easily* you could programmatically determine that there's always gonna be a path through all of the numbers without repeats
[22:08:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well the arrays are set up so that doesnt happen
[22:09:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats why the shuffling algorithm was written from scratch
[22:09:06] <Velveeta> but we're programmatically constructing the arrays
[22:09:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes randomly
[22:09:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but ensuring no oprphans and repeats
[22:09:27] <Velveeta> right, so depending on the size of your arrays, that could take a while to come out properly
[22:09:45] <Velveeta> like, on a 5-element array, it was no problem, on a 50-element array, it gets exponentially more complex
[22:10:00] <Velveeta> let me see if i can figure out how to fix this, i have an idea
[22:10:03] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: out of curiosity, what's the application of this routine?
[22:10:36] <jphase> I mean, I know you mentioned "assassins and targets" but still don't quite understand
[22:10:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[22:10:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> kay
[22:11:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> this is long but here it is
[22:11:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> so at my school we play something called the assassins game
[22:11:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically you sign up
[22:11:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> the names are "thrown into a hat and drawn"
[22:11:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then you have to "kill your target"
[22:11:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> without anyone around or anyone being able to hear you
[22:12:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> as people get eliminated you get onyl a few people left
[22:12:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: my arrays are 140 plus
[22:12:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> but  ionly have to generate them once
[22:12:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> then iwill save data
[22:16:45] <Velveeta> i think my brain is a little too fried tonight to figure out what the missing piece is to that puzzle
[22:16:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> well ill tell you what
[22:17:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[22:19:22] <Velveeta> adios for tonight
[22:19:33] <jphase> l8r Velveeta
[22:20:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> l8r
[22:24:49] <jphase> thank the lord for git
[22:33:41] <Ericx2x> Is it bad to copy and image with text on top of it instead of making the css for that text? Bad for search engines?
[22:33:49] <Ericx2x> I've been making websites that have sliders
[22:33:56] <jphase> yes
[22:33:56] <Ericx2x> usually the pictures in the sliders are overlayed with text
[22:34:15] <Ericx2x> jphase so it is bad for search engines?
[22:34:15] <rashomon> Do I have to pass a val() some string to set. Or would this be equivalent $("#narrative").val() = $("#narrative").val() + "<%=narrative%>" ; ?
[22:34:18] <jphase> yes
[22:34:29] <jphase> well.. you can set alt and title tags for SEO purposes
[22:34:36] <jphase> but it's *better* with real text as well
[22:34:37] <Ericx2x> isn't there a work around?
[22:35:18] <jphase> $("#narrative").val($("#narrative").val() + 'otherstuff'); yeah
[22:35:43] <Ericx2x> what about meta tags?
[22:35:51] <Ericx2x> don't those help SEO?
[22:35:57] <jphase> rashomon: oh I misunderstood, yeah to set a val just $("#narrative").val('value');
[22:36:07] <jphase> rashomon: my example above is to append on to the value
[22:36:41] <jphase> Ericx2x: yeah, definitely, but regarding images in a slider for example, it is best practice to have the text belonging to the slide actually on the page and styled
[22:37:05] <jphase> meta tags are for general page attributes though
[22:37:38] <Ericx2x> what are page attributes?
[22:37:41] <Ericx2x> what do you mean by that?
[22:38:20] <jphase> well, meta tags are properties for the entire page you're on
[22:38:37] <jphase> so like, the meta description applies to the page you're on
[22:38:46] <jphase> tells search engines a description of the content of that page
[22:38:55] <Ericx2x> but you can't say for example take the text taht was in the image slider
[22:38:59] <rashomon> thanks jphase for your help
[22:39:00] <Ericx2x> and put them in the meta tag?
[22:39:12] <jphase> Ericx2x: you shouldn't/wouldn't want to do that
[22:39:19] <Ericx2x> why?
[22:39:20] <jphase> rashomon: np
[22:39:29] <Ericx2x> are meta tags used only for that one purpose?
[22:39:37] <jphase> Ericx2x: it's a lazy approach to search engine optimization
[22:39:38] <__machine> is anyone familiar with CORS and cookies? apparently cookies cannot be set or read on CORS requests through javascript... and the withCredentials option means that cookies set by the remote host and sent to the remote host... does this mean that if i make a GET request to a remote domain, and the remote sets a cookie, that the cookie will be sent on subsequent POST?
[22:39:47] <jphase> no there are other meta tags too
[22:39:47] <Ericx2x> k
[22:39:48] <__machine> even though i cant read the cookie on my local page?
[22:40:08] <jphase> there's meta tags to make mobile devices render the desktop version of the site 100% of the time for example
[22:41:22] <jphase> Ericx2x: for example... http://www.avamere.com/ is an example of a slider that has actual text and content over the image, which is a good slideshow example (for SEO that is). This one however:  http://diabetomics.com/store/   has text inside the image itself, and thus not being indexed by Google
[22:42:44] <jphase> also, when you zoom in and out, text that is inside the image itself will pixelate
[22:42:57] <jphase> often looking funny on mobile
[22:43:09] <Ericx2x> but it is such a pan to get the text looking perfect
[22:43:12] <Ericx2x> pain*
[22:43:16] <Ericx2x> can't you just make invisible text
[22:43:21] <Ericx2x> so that it is indexed by google
[22:43:39] <Ericx2x> and then just have the picture w/ the picture text
[22:43:41] <jphase> yeah, but that's what we used to do in the 90s
[22:43:47] <jphase> you can though yes
[22:44:08] <jphase> it's just better to actually style the text and do some things that make it not show up funny
[22:44:30] <jphase> in my opinion anyhow
[22:44:32] <Ericx2x> but isn't it really time consuming?
[22:44:37] <jphase> yes
[22:44:45] <jphase> better, but definitely more time consuming yeah
[22:44:49] <Ericx2x> to get the margin perfect, text size perfect, font family etc
[22:45:10] <jphase> yeah, also there's the issue of white text on white images
[22:45:11] <jphase> etc.
[22:45:22] <jphase> which you could apply a vignette behind to fix (like on avamere.com)
[22:45:53] <jphase> but yeah, if you want to just git 'r done, then put the text in the image
[22:46:01] <jphase> set alt and title attributes on the image
[22:46:25] <jacoluta> lets say i have oBj = {"first" : "somevalue" , "second" : "someother"}; How do I remove oBj.first from the object?
[22:46:28] <Ericx2x> i just hope my client doesn't complain
[22:46:33] <Ericx2x> i wonder if there is a way to trick my client
[22:46:38] <Ericx2x> to make them not notice
[22:46:50] <jphase> and if you want to get uber SEO hacky, then you can put a <p> tag with your image description, then do a CSS trick to hide, either text-indent: -99999px;, display: none, visibility: hidden, etc.
[22:47:07] <jphase> well are they web-savvy?
[22:47:17] <Ericx2x> they can take their cursor
[22:47:20] <Ericx2x> and put it over the text
[22:47:20] <Ericx2x> yes
[22:47:25] <Ericx2x> and may complain
[22:47:26] <Ericx2x> about SEO
[22:47:39] <jphase> haha, no i meant do they know about "responsive design" for example?
[22:47:49] <jphase> mobile friendly layouts and such
[22:48:51] <Ericx2x> they probably know what responsive design is
[22:48:58] <Ericx2x> but not a clue about the actual coding part
[22:49:00] <jphase> jacoluta:  I think you can use oBj.slice(1);
[22:49:16] <jphase> jacoluta: haven't used that in awhile so I can't remember
[22:49:38] <jphase> Ericx2x: and you're making a slider for them?
[22:49:44] <jacoluta> jphase: tried that
[22:49:53] <Ericx2x> ive made a few sliders
[22:50:02] <jphase> jacoluta: didn't work then I assume? errors in your console?
[22:50:09] <Ericx2x> and wanted to know if there was a way i could trick my cilent when i make moore
[22:50:26] <jacoluta> jphase: no errors just returns nothing
[22:50:28] <jacoluta> []
[22:52:54] <jphase> hmm, let me test
[22:53:23] <Richhh> any idea what this error is:
[22:53:24] <Richhh> GET https://nikkomsgchannel/e?001d00500029002200440040006e0022002c0027005c00510…460053003e003500170055005e00330029007b005c005f0059005d0029002f0058005f005d
[22:54:38] <jphase> jacoluta: looks like you just use delete
[22:54:44] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/d4Q7r/
[22:55:17] <jphase> Richhh: hmm, this is a server-side error here
[22:55:28] <jacoluta> jphase: oh haha didnt even think about that
[22:55:31] <jacoluta> thnks!
[22:55:35] <jphase> np ;)
[22:56:37] <jphase> Richhh: I assume that you're also pointing your hosts file too cause there's no .com on that domain
[22:56:53] <jphase> no TLD rather, .com, .net, whatevs
[22:57:15] <Richhh> right im just doing some javascript on my pc
[22:57:26] <Richhh> client-side
[22:57:35] <Richhh> no server
[22:57:36] <jphase> k
[22:57:45] <jphase> then it's hard for me to debug hehe
[22:58:19] <Richhh> hmm ok
[22:59:15] <jacoluta> jphase: is there documentation on "delete"
[22:59:20] <jacoluta> i want to know what it does exactly
[22:59:24] <jacoluta> i cant find docs
[22:59:35] <jphase> it loops through values in the array or object and deletes on match
[22:59:56] <jphase> specifically meant for objects maybe? can't remember if it does arrays
[23:00:23] <jacoluta> haha yea i figured as much. i just wanted to know how it does it
[23:00:38] <jphase> yeah both
[23:00:43] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/d4Q7r/1/
[23:01:27] <jphase> well, it would do a for loop through each of the values of the object/array, and then if the value matches the value you pass after "delete", then it probably slices or removes the array
[23:01:35] <jphase> er.... value/key pair
[23:01:49] <jphase> on the latest fiddle ^ you notice it removes the key too
[23:01:54] <jphase> array starts at 1 on console
[23:02:03] <jacoluta> okie makes sense. thanks again
[23:02:09] <jphase> np
[23:10:51] <jphase> Anyone ever use Cheerio for node?
[23:11:07] <vhsjon> Hi guys, I have this JSON object: http://pastebin.com/9EDzdaFc and I want to loop through it and get the name of the 5 objects, ie. Incident, DangerObs etc. When I loop through it with a $.each my loop-object becomes all the different objects, but I cant seem to fetch the name of the object itself. Any ideas?
[23:11:57] <__machine> im making a CORS request and xhr.withCredentials = true on the request and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true on the response... the response comes back with Set-Cookie header... but subsequent requests do not have a Cookie header... why not? cors docs say i cant read the cookies in my JS, but they should still be set and sent by the browser?

[23:13:20] <jphase> .each ftw :)
[23:13:36] <Ericx2x> so if I do a display:hidden on some text that I want to get SEO'd
[23:13:38] <Ericx2x> that will work?
[23:14:00] <jphase> Ericx2x: there is controversy over this...
[23:14:16] <Ericx2x> what is the controversy?
[23:14:42] <jphase> but yes is the short answer
[23:14:44] <jphase> it's scraped by google
[23:14:46] <jphase> well...
[23:15:19] <Ericx2x> well?
[23:15:23] <jphase> some search engines, (the lame ones), can scrape content and try to filter or run execution based on attributes relating to CSS
[23:15:36] <jphase> nothing you need to worry about
[23:15:54] <vhsjon> jphase: ahh, thanks! Too used to that i beeing a counter from OO programming ^^
[23:16:00] <jphase> but some old school SEO nerds will use text-indent because they're used to accommodating search engines that either no longer exist or no longer work that way
[23:16:00] <Ericx2x> what search engine exists besides google?
[23:16:17] <jphase> np
[23:16:24] <jphase> lol, good point Ericx2x!
[23:16:39] <jphase> that's why I say "it's fine to display: none; for SEO"
[23:16:56] <Ericx2x> thanks jphase
[23:16:56] <jphase> CSS is not scraped by SEO any longer
[23:17:31] <Ericx2x> eh
[23:17:35] <Ericx2x> how did i just underline that?
[23:17:41] <Ericx2x> i didnt know you can even underline in irc
[23:17:43] <jphase> Google and most other crawler bots will scrape with a mobile library and only grab the html text and parse through it with DOM object methods
[23:17:57] <rashomon> I wanted to add text to textarea. What am I doing wrong here? http://bpaste.net/show/7BBpi57kD76FE7AKFcSH/
[23:18:20] <jphase> rashomon: not .val for textarea cause it's a containing element
[23:18:29] <jphase> rashomon: .contents()
[23:18:32] <jphase> er...
[23:18:33] <jphase> .text()
[23:18:33] <b-ot> jphase: usually nicer
[23:18:34] <jphase> sorry
[23:18:34] <jphase> lol
[23:18:37] <jphase> it's late
[23:18:53] <Cork> jphase: no
[23:18:59] <jphase> isn't it?
[23:18:59] <Cork> .val works fine for textareas
[23:19:04] <jphase> oh snap
[23:19:12] <Cork> .val works for all form elements
[23:19:17] <jphase> rashomon:  you forgot the $ on that function
[23:19:19] <jphase> that's your problem
[23:19:21] <Cork> (well except form ;D )
[23:19:49] <rashomon> jphase: in some other place this worked for t-area, var text_area = $("#narrative");    text_area.val(text_area.val() + data);
[23:19:58] <jphase> Cork or b-ot, either of you node nerds?
[23:20:22] <jphase> rashomon: yeah, it works as Cork just mentioned
[23:20:38] <rashomon> alright
[23:21:00] <rashomon> thanks guys for the suggestion. will try
[23:21:31] <Cork> rashomon: you arn't waiting for dom ready
[23:21:36] <Cork> that is why it fails
[23:21:53] <Cork> (function() {})() is just a scope
[23:22:07] <Cork> $(function() {}); is the event listener
[23:23:31] <rashomon> Cork: so I think my current version executes before DOM ready
[23:23:37] <Cork> 7yes
[23:23:39] <Cork> *yes
[23:23:50] <Cork> so the selector doesn't match the textarea
[23:23:57] <Cork> and that's why you don't add the text
[23:24:48] <rashomon> appreciate the insight
[23:27:19] <resting> now that the selector property is deprecated, what is the best way to get the selector used on an object?
[23:27:42] <Cork> it is?
[23:27:51] <Cork> that's news to me....
[23:28:13] <resting> ya..
[23:28:15] <resting> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#selector-property-on-jquery-objects
[23:28:34] <Cork> lovely...
[23:28:43] <Cork> (luckely i don't use it but...)
[23:28:51] <Cork> resting: most likely it means there won't be a way
[23:29:48] <Cork> resting: though i must agree, there is little defense for providing that string
[23:30:07] <resting> Cork: hmâ€¦i see. i rethink the flow then
[23:30:20] <Cork> resting: as if you want an info like that it normally mean you most likely have the wrong structure in your code
[23:30:45] <Cork> resting: thx for the info btw
[23:30:51] <_pingu> given a n browser tab s with identical content. is running a script in that situation critical? for instance running a script on a tag with the same id in 2 browser tabs?
[23:31:14] <Cork> a n?
[23:31:23] <_pingu> Cork: sorry
[23:31:29] <_pingu> given are n browser tab s with identical content. is running a script in that situation critical? for instance running a script on a tag with the same id in 2 browser tabs?
[23:31:35] <Cork> and "s" ?
[23:31:43] <Cork> an n and s is variables?
[23:31:45] <resting> Cork: i see. ya..thinking of another way of doing it.
[23:31:51] <resting> Cork: no problem..just happened to google that :)
[23:32:11] <Cork> resting: well it was still news for me
[23:32:20] <_pingu> given are 1-n browser tabs with identical content. is running a script in that situation critical? for instance running a script on a tag with the same id in 2 browser tabs?
[23:32:47] * jphase tries think of a real life situation where the selector needs to be programmatically obtained
[23:32:48] <Cork> _pingu: what is the question?
[23:33:09] <Cork> jphase: if you need that you should get the string not the jquery object
[23:33:19] <jphase> yeah, that's what I was thinking
[23:33:33] <jphase> and normally the programmer is the one using the selector so...
[23:33:41] <Cork> well no
[23:33:51] <Cork> but you can just document what they should send
[23:34:19] <Cork> either you want a static element, or a selector
[23:34:29] <jphase> I never even knew .selector existed, I have only stored selectors in strings for reuse
[23:34:35] <jphase> or an object
[23:34:38] <Cork> there is little defense for asking for a static element, and from that grabbing a selector
[23:34:50] <_pingu> Cork: Would a script work browser tab specific?
[23:34:56] <Cork> jphase: it existed to support .live
[23:35:18] <jphase> yeah I was reading about that, which implies it's only for pulling back selectors from dynamically created elements right? post-creation?
[23:35:22] <Cork> _pingu: if you ask if the content in a page is per tab, then yes it is
[23:35:28] <jphase> it was*
[23:35:48] <Cork> jphase: not really
[23:35:58] <Cork> .selector is to store the string passed to $()
[23:36:04] <jphase> .live was used on non-dynamic stuff too then?
[23:36:09] <jphase> yeah
[23:36:19] <Cork> live was a bad syntax to do delegate
[23:36:20] <jphase> wondering what the relationship to .live was really
[23:36:56] <jphase> I see, so there basically just wasn't a good reason for .selector anyway probably
[23:36:58] <Cork> $(selector).live(event, func) => $(document).delegate(selector, event, func)
[23:37:08] <jphase> despite there being new methods for live (delegate)
[23:37:16] <_pingu> Cork: if 2 browser tabs with the same content load the same script, does each work on the tab it was loaded for?
[23:37:22] <Cork> jphase: no, it just gives opportunity for bad coding style
[23:37:33] <jphase> knowledge++;
[23:37:33] <jphase> thx
[23:37:39] <Cork> _pingu: you can't load the same content in two tabs
[23:37:50] <Cork> _pingu: you can show the same info, but it is two different pages
[23:39:03] <_pingu> Cork: And the script is limited to the browser tab it is running in?
[23:39:10] <jphase> Any oop node folk that prefer using custom routing rather than express or should I just go with express for ease?
[23:39:17] <Cork> _pingu: the script is limited to the page it is loaded in
[23:39:43] <_pingu> Cork: and a different browser tab is a diffenrent page?
[23:39:50] <jphase> yep
[23:40:08] <Cork> _pingu: i've already answered that
[23:40:15] <jphase> even a different system process if you use chrome ;)
[23:40:25] <Cork> "<Cork> _pingu: you can show the same info, but it is two different pages" <--
[23:40:31] <_pingu> Cork: I see. thanks!
[23:40:33] <_pingu> :-)
[23:45:53] <vhsjon> hi again guys, I have a large JSON structure, and I want to fetch an object from it, depending on what Ice chosen in a dropdown. The value of the Dropdown chosen gets passed as a parameter in a function, and corresponds to the name in the JSON file. Then i want to fetch that JSON object by using the parameter name like this: observationJSON[observa
[23:45:53] <vhsjon> tionType]; But it turns out undefined. If I do observationType["DangerObs"], then it works. And if I console.log observationType, "DangerObs" comes out, but it doesnt work. Any ideas?
[23:47:03] <Cork> vhsjon: how are you loading the json?
[23:47:05] <vhsjon> I guess my short version is: "Can you use dynamic names to fetch parts of a JSON object?"
[23:47:32] <Cork> vhsjon: strictly no, if you really mean a json object
[23:47:41] <vhsjon> Cork: from a local file, http://pastebin.com/e24cAfR8
[23:47:44] <Cork> vhsjon: json needs to be parsed to js objects/arrays
[23:48:06] <Cork> vhsjon: is the server sending the correct mimetype?
[23:48:13] <Cork> application/json ?
[23:48:26] <vhsjon> Cork: and the observationJSON object is accessible to the function
[23:48:31] <Cork> vhsjon: is the server sending the correct mimetype?
[23:48:35] <Cork> application/json ?
[23:48:55] <Cork> that is the header Content-Type: application/json
[23:48:57] <vhsjon> I get this: Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain from all my js files, but not my observations.json file
[23:49:14] <vhsjon> I dont fetch it with ajax, its a local file
[23:49:18] <Cork> ok so fix your sever configuration
[23:49:37] <Cork> vhsjon: your running from file:// ?
[23:49:41] <vhsjon> yeah
[23:49:46] <Cork> :s
[23:50:00] <Cork> that is not fully supported by browsers for the last many years
[23:50:06] <vhsjon> I have --allow-access-from-files flag set in chrome
[23:50:11] <Cork> file:// doens't provide content-type
[23:50:24] <vhsjon> ok
[23:50:25] <Cork> and that means you will get problems
[23:50:38] <Cork> though you could manually run $.parseJSON()
[23:50:50] <vhsjon> like fetching values from a JSON file with dynamic names?
[23:50:55] <Cork> but i would REALLY recommend running a real small webserver
[23:51:10] <Cork> vhsjon: you can't fetchs single values from json
[23:51:14] <Cork> that is just a longs string
[23:51:21] <vhsjon> ok
[23:51:22] <Cork> you need to parse it to js objects and arrays
[23:51:34] <Cork> jquery does that for you if the content-type header is correct
[23:51:43] <Cork> $.parseJSON is a hack solution you can use
[23:51:49] <vhsjon> ok
[23:52:11] <Cork> vhsjon: but, REALLY get a webserver
[23:52:26] <Cork> ther are ones out there that is just a kb is size
[23:52:34] <Cork> and it would solve all these problems
[23:52:54] <Cork> *a few kb in size
[23:52:55] <vhsjon> the thing is that Im using a JSON file locally to store all my html elements that can contain a value or that can be chosen in my app, so that I can restore anything a user has done, since with cordova/phonegap you cannot handle events like if someone calls you while you are using the app
[23:53:00] <jacoluta> how do i use .get .eq on an object?
[23:53:14] <Cork> jacoluta: why would you?
[23:53:23] <Cork> jacoluta: those are for handling dom elements
[23:53:44] <jacoluta> just to simply the question i suppose.
[23:53:58] <vhsjon> Cork: so thats why I dont use a web server, I have a web server, but its intentional that this file is not stored there
[23:53:59] <Cork> obj[num] is how you do .get
[23:54:08] <Cork> jacoluta: .eq makes no sense at all
[23:54:16] <jacoluta> well yea i k
[23:54:39] <Cork> vhsjon: you can still run a separate webserver for the computer access
[23:54:51] <Cork> vhsjon: basically you should avoid file://
[23:54:56] <jacoluta> obj[3]
[23:54:59] <Cork> there is better ways around it
[23:55:02] <jacoluta> will not get the 3rd item tho
[23:55:11] <Cork> jacoluta: no it will get the forth
[23:55:14] <Cork> just like .get
[23:55:26] <jacoluta> haha. yea it doesnt do that either
[23:55:31] <vhsjon> Cork: ok, thanks for the advice! Ill check out how I can change my solution
[23:55:34] <jphase> jacoluta: are you using keys?
[23:55:34] <Cork> jacoluta: then you arn't working with an object
[23:55:44] <jacoluta> yea i am using keys
[23:55:46] <Cork> sorry array
[23:55:53] <Cork> jacoluta: keys is strings not numbers
[23:56:01] <jacoluta> im using an object
[23:56:07] <Cork> jacoluta: then you need to use the name
[23:56:09] <jphase> jacoluta: still what Cork
[23:56:13] <Cork> obj["stirng name"]
[23:56:14] <jphase> +said
[23:56:26] <jacoluta> ik. but i want to grab the nth
[23:56:28] <jacoluta> in some cases
[23:56:30] <Cork> or obj.name
[23:56:39] <jphase> jacoluta: you'll have to loop through then
[23:56:47] <Cork> jacoluta: then you need to loop the keys in the object and grab the nth key
[23:56:50] <jacoluta> eek
[23:56:58] <jacoluta> ill have to figure out a better way to do this then
[23:56:59] <jacoluta> thanks
[23:57:08] <jphase> jacoluta: really that's just what .get does anyhow though fyi
[23:57:23] <jphase> or no
[23:57:28] <Cork> the best some browsers support is obj[Object.keys(obj)[3]]
[23:57:29] <jphase> not .get actually cause that's just an index
[23:57:33] <jphase> nvm
[23:58:01] <Cork> jacoluta: but that only works in browsers that provides the fairly new Object.keys
[23:58:43] <jacoluta> this is only going to work in modern browsers anyhoo
[23:58:45] <jacoluta> so TY!
[23:58:47] <jacoluta> works great
[23:59:08] <Cork> jacoluta: though if you need to handle it like that you should prob not use an object
[23:59:17] <jacoluta> i need the keys
[23:59:19] <jacoluta> tho
[23:59:21] <Cork> jacoluta: as you have no guarantee of the order in an object
[23:59:56] <Cork> jacoluta: so you should prob use an array instead
