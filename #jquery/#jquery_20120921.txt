[00:00:09] <gnarf> bot-t: is b-ot okay?
[00:00:09] <bot-t> gnarf, It is decidedly so.
[00:00:16] <gnarf> if you say so man....
[00:01:14] <gnarf> retrostyle|13: i think you accidentally some letters
[00:01:40] <gnarf> retrostyle|13: doesn't seem like anyone has any ideas for java authentication - have you tried google / stackoverflow?
[00:02:01] <gnarf> retrostyle|13: im not sure what this has to do with JS either
[00:02:22] <retrostyle|13> yes but a like to here some kinds of best prectices
[00:02:32] <coldhead> the simplest auth uses the honour system
[00:03:05] <retrostyle|13> and like to have a conversation
[00:04:33] <coldhead> i like to do that sometimes too
[00:04:50] <gnarf> coldhead: do you have robot ears?
[00:09:29] <kristofers> http://www.livechatinc.com/tour/ anyone know how i could replicate this kind of navigation
[00:10:30] * gnarf waves goodnight to bot-t
[00:10:36] <gnarf> bot-t: i love you
[00:10:37] <bot-t> no you don't
[00:10:39] <erdos> kristofers: maybe some heavily modified jqueryui tabs
[00:11:04] <kristofers> i though of that but i'm wondering if there isn't something else
[00:11:57] <jac0bz1> I dont get this, $("#sidebar").insertAfter("#main"); produce this error: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[00:14:28] <amccloud> Anyway to get all the 3 elements in a jquery object?
[00:18:21] <amccloud> :nth-child doesn't work for me because I don't want the child.
[00:19:04] <coldhead> ?nth
[00:19:05] <bot-t> coldhead, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[00:19:19] <coldhead> or possibly :lt() && gt:()
[00:19:41] <amccloud> actually nth-child did work I just had to use it with filter()
[00:19:55] <_zoggy_> nth-child also is broken in some browsers
[00:19:55] <amccloud> $items.filter(':nth-child(3n)')
[00:19:58] <_zoggy_> and in opera its buggy
[00:21:42] <harbhub> fFuckcckcckkckck
[00:21:44] <harbhub> damn it
[00:21:48] <harbhub> i just had so much progress
[00:21:53] <harbhub> clicked 'set as base'
[00:21:56] <harbhub> and it didnt save it
[00:21:59] <harbhub> fucking fiddle
[00:22:10] <harbhub> i needed to update it first i guess
[00:22:12] <harbhub> gotdamn
[00:23:17] <_zoggy_> why are you developing in fiddle?
[00:23:27] <_zoggy_> just use a text editor + browser...
[00:23:34] <_zoggy_> or use a proper ide
[00:31:16] <prishabh> harbhub: which?
[00:33:49] <harbhub> zoggy:  let me edit in fiddle in peace  :)
[00:35:43] <coldhead> let's all simmer down
[00:37:11] <Eviltwin> Is that all you advise these days?
[00:40:30] <coldhead> sometimes i advise we slim down
[00:40:35] <coldhead> it depends on the obesity
[00:41:06] <coldhead> nopm @ prishabh
[00:41:06] <harbhub> why does normalize.css make an indent at the top of the page?
[00:41:11] <coldhead> ?nopm @ prishabh
[00:41:11] <bot-t> prishabh, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[00:41:12] <harbhub> like it leaves a little margin
[00:41:13] <coldhead> >: |
[00:41:48] <prishabh> I don't have any question, I am your old friend.
[00:44:08] <kaleb> I'm trying to understand how to make a query UI dialog, and cannot get it to work, can anyone point me to a link where I can get a better understanding of how to put one of these confirmation boxes up?
[00:45:05] <harbhub> i moved all my fiddle code to my .ejs page in my website
[00:45:07] <harbhub> :)
[00:46:26] <harbhub> big question
[00:46:38] <harbhub> how do you save a page that has a bunch of input fields filled out?
[00:46:49] <harbhub> so that you can go back to it to continue working on it?
[00:46:57] <harbhub> with those inputs still there, like save the DOM state
[00:47:02] <harbhub> is that possible?
[00:48:28] <coldhead> you should have planned ahead here, buddy
[00:48:47] <coldhead> i would write something that converts JSON to/from a table
[00:48:49] <coldhead> and use that
[00:49:11] <prishabh> harbhub: you might use the localStorage API
[00:50:14] <harbhub> which to use?
[00:50:23] <harbhub> localstore or coldhead json?
[00:50:44] <harbhub> coldhead:  how do we do that?
[00:50:55] <coldhead> its a matter for yourself
[00:51:03] <coldhead> and esp. no me because i am gommuting
[00:51:21] <harbhub> okay i've never handled json but wish me luck
[00:51:32] <harbhub> you soon-to-be-mute coldhead, you
[00:51:52] <prishabh> use localStorage, it will require JSON anyway.
[00:51:59] <harbhub> prishabh:  how is that possible?  i would like to localstore everything that happens and save it
[00:52:08] <harbhub> so that i can latter go back to that state
[00:52:14] <prishabh> localstorage will store client side, are you ok with that ?
[00:52:28] <prishabh> or you wanna persist in the DB ?
[00:52:51] <harbhub> both
[00:53:09] <harbhub> lets persist in a db
[00:53:09] <prishabh> which part are you having problem with ?
[00:53:21] <prishabh> when I say persist in the DB I meant server-side :)
[00:53:21] <harbhub> where to start
[00:53:26] <harbhub> yep
[00:53:30] <harbhub> mongodb
[00:53:40] <harbhub> is my db of choice
[00:53:40] <prishabh> you need to read some basic tut on your_server_side_lang+mongodb then.
[00:53:58] <prishabh> but anything with mongodb is really easy.
[00:54:17] <prishabh> send the $_POST request, sanitize if you want, send to mongo, done. fetch on page load/ajax/whatever.
[00:54:49] <harbhub> sanitize?
[00:55:04] <EdwardIII> hey chaps
[00:55:21] <EdwardIII> ooo mongolicious
[00:55:38] <EdwardIII> i've been working on backbone.js+node+express+mongoose+mongo
[00:55:43] <harbhub> prishabh:  mongo and serverside storage is better
[00:56:05] <harbhub> i'm using node express ejs mongo
[00:56:06] <EdwardIII> been fairly smooth sailing, i just wanted a thin ORM+REST for my backbone stuff that i didn't have to worry about
[00:56:13] <harbhub> you like mongoose?
[00:56:24] <EdwardIII> i've not used it in production, but in that development environment it seemed pretty sweet
[00:56:29] <harbhub> what template engine are you using?
[00:56:32] <EdwardIII> it was pretty much invisible to me
[00:56:35] <SomeoneWeird> ejs ftw
[00:56:36] <prishabh> mongoose is fine although I simply use the native official driver, whatever the name is.
[00:56:36] <harbhub> for your express views?
[00:56:43] <EdwardIII> i'm using jade but i don't like it
[00:56:48] <harbhub> jade sucks
[00:56:48] <SomeoneWeird> use ejs
[00:56:52] <harbhub> switch to ejs now
[00:56:58] <EdwardIII> well i did look into that
[00:57:01] <harbhub> or mustache, dust, anything that is a subset of html
[00:57:09] <harbhub> take my advice
[00:57:13] <harbhub> jade is not smart to use
[00:57:19] <harbhub> use something that is html
[00:57:36] <harbhub> that way anyone can read your code
[00:57:38] <EdwardIII> but ejs + node didn't seem to be able to inherit templates or anything? on the express channel they said i'd have to include a header and a footer in all my templates
[00:57:46] <RWOverdijk> I'm having some issues with focus(). Are there known bugs, or am I seriously doing things wrong? (example, executing $('#hsearch input').focus() on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11145345/focus-on-bootstrap-textarea-with-jquery)
[00:57:47] <SomeoneWeird> it can now
[00:57:49] <EdwardIII> until ejs implement something like extends
[00:57:54] <harbhub> edward use a layout then
[00:57:56] <SomeoneWeird> EdwardIII, <% include templatename.ejs %>
[00:58:08] <EdwardIII> harbhub: apparently that doesn't work anymore
[00:58:19] <harbhub> well i dont have many pages
[00:58:23] <harbhub> so i just use ejs
[00:58:26] <harbhub> because it is html
[00:58:28] <harbhub> with some perks
[00:58:30] <harbhub> lol
[00:58:42] <harbhub> anyways, can you show me the ropes with mongoose?
[00:58:47] <EdwardIII> only advantage with jade was that layouts work
[00:58:54] <EdwardIII> but yeah, i'd rather real HTML
[00:58:59] <harbhub> help me make a simple collection that i can add username and password to?
[00:59:05] <harbhub> real html > jade
[00:59:15] <EdwardIII> harbhub: well i pretty much just installed it, used the express example for using mongoose + mongo, and i was away
[00:59:25] <harbhub> where is that example?
[00:59:43] <harbhub> do you run your local mongo in a separate terminal?
[01:00:06] <SomeoneWeird> <EdwardIII> only advantage with jade was that layouts work < you can include templates with templates
[01:00:43] <SomeoneWeird> probably a better queston for #node.js :p
[01:00:45] <harbhub> jade would be great if it was html
[01:00:45] <EdwardIII> SomeoneWeird: but the other way around - you can't have like, a main layout, then include the content inside can you?
[01:00:48] <EdwardIII> heh yeah
[01:01:02] <harbhub> edward can you point me to the tutorial?
[01:01:07] <EdwardIII> harbhub: hrm i can't actually find the same tut i was working from now
[01:01:12] <harbhub> :(
[01:01:51] <SomeoneWeird> <html><body><% include body.ejs $></body></head>
[01:01:56] <EdwardIII> harbhub: keep looking though!
[01:02:19] <EdwardIII> harbhub: #node.js will probably be more helpful
[01:02:27] <harbhub> edward i just want to know how to make a collection and pass something into it from an input
[01:02:32] <harbhub> okay i'll try them lol
[01:02:47] <harbhub> how do i traverse to another channel?
[01:02:50] <harbhub> i forgot
[01:03:16] <EdwardIII> chaps i've put together a simple plugin here, but when i try to call it i get '... has no method trackEvents'? https://gist.github.com/3760263
[01:03:19] <EdwardIII> harbhub: /join #node.js
[01:06:15] <harbhub> well nodejs is not talking
[01:07:15] <harbhub> edward can you gist me a simple mongo collection using mongoose?
[01:07:22] <harbhub> maybe your server.js/app.js file?
[01:07:43] <fatninja> good morning. I am using jQuery Mobile 1.1. I want to create an anchor to a page, something like /feed#comment, in that page I have <a name="comment"></a> . The problem is that the browser takes me to that anchor but then it goes quickly to the top. I'm thinking jquery mobile after it loads all things it goes back on top. How can I catch that event ? I've searched through documentation and
[01:07:43] <fatninja> couldn't find anything that could help me. I've tried to create a 'pageinit' callback, that checks if window.location.hash is set and then attribute that value to window.location.href... but it did not work.
[01:08:38] <EdwardIII> harbhub: this one looks pretty good: http://pixelhandler.com/blog/2012/02/09/develop-a-restful-api-using-node-js-with-express-and-mongoose/
[01:09:21] <ankush> Hello All
[01:09:37] <ankush> I want to develope screen
[01:10:34] <harbhub> thats i'm reading that edwardIII
[01:10:38] <ankush> here there are lots of blocks and each block contain edit button and on click generate form to edit content but on same page
[01:10:42] <ankush> using ajax
[01:11:09] <ankush> and only focus
[01:11:24] <ankush> on edit form not on other blocks
[01:12:22] <EdwardIII> harbhub: which bit are you stuck on?
[01:13:40] <harbhub> connecting to my db
[01:13:44] <harbhub> i'm using mongohq
[01:13:49] <harbhub> to host my db
[01:14:01] <harbhub> mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/ecomm_database');
[01:14:11] <harbhub> don't know what to put there
[01:14:19] <_zoggy_> rtfm?
[01:17:15] <EdwardIII> hrm has the preferred way of writing jQuery plugins changed much perhaps? http://debuggable.com/posts/how-to-write-jquery-plugins:4f72ab2e-7310-4a74-817a-0a04cbdd56cb
[01:17:35] <RWOverdijk> I'm having some issues with focus(). Are there known bugs, or am I seriously doing things wrong? (example, executing $('#hsearch input').focus() on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11145345/focus-on-bootstrap-textarea-with-jquery)
[01:17:37] <EdwardIII> looks pretty different to: https://gist.github.com/3760263
[01:18:07] <EdwardIII> harbhub: in that tut he starts off with how his app.js looks - compare that against yours and see if you can figure out what needs to go in
[01:19:49] <badbandit> hello, I have a list and I am wondering how would I select a parent <li> AND all of it's siblings from an anchor within one of the li's?
[01:20:02] <badbandit> if I do .parent().siblings() it excludes the parent
[01:20:12] <badbandit> wondering if there's an efficient way to do it
[01:20:21] <hurdos> Hello
[01:21:43] <RWOverdijk> badbandit, If you already have the parent, and you're using it in your selector, just .push() it to the resultset.
[01:22:20] <RWOverdijk> badbandit, Don't look it up twice. Or, if for some odd reason you really want to, include the selector :eq(yourElement.index())
[01:22:31] <RWOverdijk> But I'd just push it in.
[01:23:36] <Robbo_> $('.FlashMe').css('background-color', '#ffffcc').animate('background-color', '#ffffff');
[01:23:39] <Robbo_> why is that not working?
[01:23:42] <Robbo_> driving me insane
[01:23:50] <Robbo_> tried rgb and wanted to use rgba
[01:24:01] <Robbo_> it sets the first colour but no animation
[01:24:08] <Robbo_> is there some limitation i dont know about?
[01:24:41] <fatninja> can anyone tell me how to make hashes work on jquery mobile 1.1 ?
[01:27:27] <juro> hi, I have a problem with a click event firing multiple times after clicking once: http://pastie.org/4770734 - I am not sure whether it has to do with my $.post or with the .click itself.
[01:28:22] <Robbo_> anyone?
[01:28:31] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, yes. The color animation stuff requires a plugin.
[01:28:42] <Robbo_> damn
[01:28:43] <Robbo_> thanks
[01:28:49] <quicksilver> it's standard in jQuery UI though
[01:28:50] <ankush> I have issue which is when i update page content using ajax need to only focus newly content rather than all on page
[01:28:51] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, Because it requires calculations, converting colors etc.
[01:28:52] <quicksilver> (colour animation)
[01:28:52] <ankush> have any idea
[01:28:54] <ankush> ????
[01:29:01] <RWOverdijk> Yes but jquery ui is a bit too much.
[01:29:12] <Robbo_> yeah, just thought it would be core
[01:29:18] <Robbo_> I'm not going to add another dependency
[01:29:29] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, You could, there are small ones.
[01:29:32] <Robbo_> I'll just do it the "hard way"
[01:29:55] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[01:30:05] <RWOverdijk> Already updated for jquery 1.8
[01:30:21] <Robbo_> oh thanks :)
[01:30:34] <Robbo_> I have just spent an hour or so thinking I was doing something wrong
[01:31:03] <RWOverdijk> ankush, The way you're asking your question is not going to help you solve it. I don't understand your question, also you seem a little pushy. Could you please rephrase your question?
[01:31:15] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, With you many others.
[01:31:22] <RWOverdijk> I found out the hard way, too.
[01:32:07] <harbhub> coldhead:  i have a challenge
[01:32:18] <Robbo_> think they would make it clear in docs somewhere
[01:32:21] <Robbo_> like the animation docs
[01:32:32] <RWOverdijk> juro, It's not triggering multiple times for me: http://jsfiddle.net/HfWSy/
[01:32:41] <harbhub> i want to take the each cell and multiple it's input value by its column value
[01:32:41] <kai> hi folks
[01:33:10] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, Bold statement.
[01:33:16] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, It's in there...
[01:33:19] <diverdude> Hello, can anybody help me understand why the background color is not changing color when the button is pressed? http://jsfiddle.net/SrU5u/
[01:33:25] <Robbo_> lol really?
[01:33:28] <kai> is there any way I can get my jqueryui page to reposition the "position" elements when the font size is changed (e.g. the user uses ctrl-+/ctrl--)?
[01:33:30] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, "All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used)."
[01:33:32] <Robbo_> <- fail
[01:33:56] <RWOverdijk> diverdude, Join the club. "All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used)."
[01:33:57] <juro> RWOverdijk, hmm, that's weird. There is a Symfony2 application behind it but that doesn't throw around Javascript
[01:34:04] <ankush> OK I am working in implementing new screen, here i want to use ajax to add new form click on some button and also at the same time disable all other page content so user can not touch it and only perform something on newly ajaxify content
[01:34:33] <Robbo_> now I feel even more noob
[01:34:37] <Robbo_> I hate js/jquery
[01:34:42] <RWOverdijk> kai, keyup, check keycodes and ctrl key followed by some js updating the positions? Sure, that's possible.
[01:34:49] <diverdude> RWOverdijk: what? I think you are wrong since if i change the css background directly from jquery it works without problems
[01:35:18] <kai> RWOverdijk: so I need to do that manually for every element I position?
[01:35:42] <RWOverdijk> kai, I think so, if you change sizes.
[01:35:49] <ankush> Now got it "RWOverdijk"?
[01:35:52] <RWOverdijk> diverdude, A sorry, I thought you meant animate.
[01:36:20] <RWOverdijk> ankush, You can load pages dynamically. What do you mean by "disabling" the others? You want to disable navigation?
[01:36:47] <kai> annoying
[01:36:48] <Robbo_> that library is too new for me :/
[01:36:53] <Robbo_> im stuck on an old jquery
[01:37:05] <Robbo_> 1.5.2 I think
[01:37:07] <kai> I'm beginning to think I'd be better off with an installable applications
[01:37:13] <Robbo_> is it on github so I can get an older version?
[01:37:18] <Robbo_> RWOverdijk:
[01:37:37] <RWOverdijk> diverdude, http://jsfiddle.net/SrU5u/1/
[01:38:08] <RWOverdijk> diverdude, typo. Classname was chatnotify. Should have been notify.
[01:38:31] <RWOverdijk> Robbo_, Is what where why?
[01:38:36] <diverdude> RWOverdijk: doh hehe :) thx
[01:38:53] <Robbo_> meh it's drink time, thanks RWOverdijk I'll work it out later that I know I was just being stupid
[01:39:01] <RWOverdijk> anyway I have to get back to my things now.
[01:39:06] <RWOverdijk> good luck :)
[01:46:20] <badbandit> is there something I need to do specially to detect a class that has been added dynamically?
[01:46:35] <badbandit> hasClass does not detect it after I add it in a previous call
[01:48:53] <bitbuzzer> how do I get the background style attribute of a droppable element within the drop event?
[01:50:28] <xdjuj> bitbuzzer it should detect it
[01:50:41] <xdjuj> It depend on how you add it, could we see your code ?
[01:50:47] <bitbuzzer> sure, one moment
[01:50:53] <xdjuj> http://jsfiddle.net/
[01:52:02] <bitbuzzer> here's the code: http://pastie.org/4770830
[01:52:19] <bitbuzzer> I'm actually trying to get the background of a child element within the droppable...
[01:52:34] <xdjuj> We need your all test :)
[01:52:55] <xdjuj> http://jsfiddle.net
[01:53:05] <xdjuj> A full funcitonal test will be easier :)
[01:53:43] <bitbuzzer> xdjuj that'll take some time, as its a complex page... but that's the gist of if
[01:53:45] <bitbuzzer> *it
[01:54:16] <bitbuzzer> xdjuj console is returning an empty string
[01:56:37] <bitbuzzer> xdjuj I can get it via css('backgroundImage'), I'll figure it out from there :)
[01:56:53] <harbhub> how do you do a 'typeof number'
[01:57:04] <harbhub> if (x != typeof number)
[01:57:16] <harbhub> how do i do that to check if x is not equal to a number
[01:57:17] <harbhub> ??
[01:57:59] <hooloovoo> harbhub: if ( typeof x === "number" )
[01:58:11] <harbhub> ok
[01:58:17] <harbhub> one sec
[01:59:52] <harbhub> hooloovoo: thanks got it working
[02:00:21] <danshtr> Hi All. JS doen't like the "this" after the else if. any ideas why? http://jsfiddle.net/puWMf/
[02:01:57] <hooloovoo> danshtr: nope. should work assuming it exists.
[02:02:21] <danshtr> chrome complains about it
[02:02:26] <danshtr> that "this" is unexpected
[02:02:44] <hooloovoo> which line?
[02:02:58] <harbhub> i have a row of inputs
[02:03:05] <danshtr> the line with the "else if"
[02:03:05] <hooloovoo> danshtr: ohhh
[02:03:06] <harbhub> how do i take each input
[02:03:09] <harbhub> add the value up
[02:03:12] <hooloovoo> (this.current_total < 21 && this.cards.length ==5)
[02:03:14] <hooloovoo> maybe?
[02:03:14] <harbhub> and divide by the number of values?
[02:03:24] <harbhub> i.e. find the mean of a row of inputs?
[02:03:32] <danshtr> hooloovoo: the previous elseif
[02:04:12] <hooloovoo> danshtr: there's nothing wrong there.
[02:05:03] <danshtr> then what chrome wants from me?
[02:05:11] <hooloovoo> harbhub: var a; $("input").each(function() { a += $(this).val(); }); a = a/$("input").length;
[02:06:01] <hooloovoo> danshtr: i can't find anything wrong with that code. send a link to the running site and i can look there.
[02:06:03] <anli_> Is there anyone here that have done a graphics editor with 1x1px divs as pixels?
[02:06:15] <anli_> Is it effective?
[02:06:19] <anli_> efficient
[02:06:44] <Cork> anli_: its defenitly not efficient
[02:06:45] <danshtr> its from the headstart book
[02:06:56] <anli_> You have done it?
[02:06:56] <danshtr> i'll copy the entire js
[02:06:56] <hooloovoo> anli_: it's crazy slow
[02:06:59] <anli_> ok
[02:07:07] <Cork> anli_: you would have a gigantic big dom tree, and that WILL slow the browser down to a crawl
[02:07:08] <hooloovoo> there are libs for it tho
[02:07:09] <anli_> Seems like canvas is the only way to go then
[02:07:15] <anli_> ok
[02:07:15] <hooloovoo> but they're not fast.
[02:17:08] <tocka> Hey guys
[02:17:53] <tocka> I have a google maps map that has tweets on it, is it possible somehow to add tweets on it without refreshing the map? I mean that it would show live tweets?
[02:17:59] <tocka> Or do I have to refresh everytime?
[02:22:07] <ankush> meas there are lots of blocks each having edit button and on click it adding new form
[02:22:11] <danshtr> hooloovoo: thanks for the help. who knew that "and" in js is && ? ;) what this got to do with "this" i dont know, but once changing "and" to &&, everything worked!
[02:22:29] <ankush> once this form appears all other blocks disabled
[02:22:34] <ankush> like that
[02:23:02] <ozette> I have a jQuery plugin full of odd extended ascii characters, they seem like whitespaces in notepad++ but chrome renders and reveals them as weird A's. Anyone know of an editor which can replace those? Notepad++ won't do it
[02:26:51] <AdamPDotty> ozette: you should be able to set encodings in notepad++
[02:26:59] <diverdude> why is the header of the box not changing to red when the button is clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/8NE4v/
[02:27:24] <AdamPDotty> and even, if it does not display a character, you can still copy/delete/replace
[02:30:16] <AdamPDotty> dude: removeClass != addClass
[02:30:52] <fatninja> using jquery mobile, /link#hash , takes me to hash id, then very quickly to the top, how can I catch that event that takes me to the top ?
[02:31:15] <ozette> AdamPDotty, hmm ok
[02:34:40] <harbhub> problem
[02:34:48] <harbhub> so if the input is left empty
[02:34:54] <harbhub> i want it to set that input value to the number 0
[02:35:01] <harbhub> so far it isnt working the way i tried!
[02:35:02] <harbhub> help
[02:35:16] <harbhub> how do i take an empty input and make its value worth 0
[02:35:17] <harbhub> ?
[02:35:31] <harbhub> so that if i add it with other numbers it will not return NaN
[02:35:38] <harbhub> is this possible?
[02:35:56] <hooloovoo> harbhub: if ( !$(this).val() ) return; else a += $(this).val();
[02:36:06] <AdamPDotty> you might try something like value= 1*value;
[02:36:21] <harbhub> huh
[02:39:57] <harbhub> yeah neither are working for me
[02:40:10] <harbhub> hooloovoo i will try your idea
[02:42:49] <ankush> Hello All
[02:43:49] <ankush> any one having idea to disable page elements if new ajax content load on page
[02:43:52] <ankush> ???????????/
[02:52:12] <faraway> ankush: what do you mean with disable ?
[02:52:49] <ankush> disable means displayed but not able to click on any button on element
[02:53:35] <ankush> actually need to render new form click on edit button so if once loaded using ajax edit button disabled
[02:55:06] <faraway> ankush: if you want to dim the elements using a div element with e.g. an opacity of 0.5 and an background color which is displayed over these elements (afaik for IE you need an iframe hack for input elements)
[02:55:37] <faraway> ankush: or you could register an event listener for click, and prevent the default action while loading
[02:56:38] <faraway> ankush: i would prefere to dimish the elements, becaus then the user also has a feedback that there is something happending
[02:56:51] <harbhub> how do i set dependencies between inputs?  i'm making a precedence diagram
[02:57:11] <harbhub> so lets say i have 4 values that i want to see the duration
[02:57:15] <harbhub> you cant just add them up
[02:57:24] <harbhub> since some activities depend on others
[02:57:33] <harbhub> A = 2 days and has no dependencies
[02:57:44] <harbhub> B = 4 days and depends on A
[02:57:54] <harbhub> C = 3 days and has no dependencies
[02:57:57] <harbhub> so
[02:58:01] <harbhub> the duration should be 7
[02:58:06] <harbhub> err 6
[02:58:07] <mikecmpbll> hi chaps, my ajax get request is showing in chrome as status: (canceled)
[02:58:20] <harbhub> so how do i make that relationship happen?
[02:58:32] <mikecmpbll> everything i can find on the web relating to that is if there is a redirect or page change that interrupts the ajax but i have nothing like that
[02:58:43] <mikecmpbll> the ajax call is made on page load.
[02:59:07] <faraway> harbhub: so if you change A , B should be updated by transforming A. and the other way round ?
[02:59:15] <mikecmpbll> if i goto the get URL in my browser i see the expected json data.
[02:59:46] <harbhub> right
[02:59:49] <harbhub> well
[02:59:52] <harbhub> not exactly
[02:59:57] <harbhub> there is a final output
[03:00:02] <harbhub> which sums each pathway
[03:00:05] <harbhub> so
[03:00:15] <harbhub> you start a path with the input that has no dependencies
[03:00:22] <harbhub> there could be more than one such input
[03:00:26] <harbhub> or only one
[03:00:34] <harbhub> but needs at least one thing that can just start
[03:00:35] <harbhub> then
[03:00:43] <mikz> hi all, I found an issue in jquery - serializing select with only one option which is disabled - http://jsfiddle.net/M45H3/3/
[03:00:54] <harbhub> A = 2 = no dependencies
[03:01:01] <harbhub> B = 5 = depends on A
[03:01:04] <harbhub> so
[03:01:10] <mikz> browser does not send it at all, but jquery serializes it.. and even val() returns incorrect value
[03:01:14] <harbhub> path would be A -> B -> done
[03:01:16] <mikz> do you think it is valid bug ?
[03:01:27] <harbhub> lets add another variable
[03:01:34] <harbhub> C = 9 = no dependencies
[03:01:40] <harbhub> path would be C -> done
[03:01:50] <harbhub> so you check which path was the longest
[03:02:07] <harbhub> path 1 = 2 + 5 = 7
[03:02:13] <harbhub> path 2 = 9
[03:02:22] <harbhub> that is what i want to accomplish, any advice?
[03:02:38] <HughAJWood> mikecmpbll: is it an asynchronous? call
[03:02:55] <mikecmpbll> yes.
[03:03:49] <HughAJWood> mikecmpbll: are you passing a callback to the async call?
[03:04:14] <mikecmpbll> yeah, success and error, it enters the error
[03:04:19] <mikecmpbll> with error status 0
[03:06:10] <ankush> Thanks for the idea I thing i need to reconstruct the page to view all elements and for each element edit button new page content render
[03:06:19] <mikecmpbll> god damn d/c.
[03:06:29] <HughAJWood> mikecmpbll: are you using before send?
[03:06:47] <mikecmpbll> nope.
[03:06:59] <faraway> harbhub: do you mean something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/aAn6B/
[03:07:31] <mikecmpbll> perhaps some other jquery on that page is interfering with it hmpf.
[03:07:37] <harbhub> yes and no
[03:07:47] <harbhub> i'm making a cumulative frequency diagram
[03:07:49] <harbhub> so
[03:07:55] <harbhub> ok hold on
[03:08:19] <harbhub> that might be useful for determining the critical path
[03:08:22] <harbhub> but
[03:08:36] <harbhub> i need to make a cumulative frequency distribution first
[03:08:46] <harbhub> faraway: have you heard of monte carlo sampling?
[03:09:02] <HughAJWood> mikecmpbll: maybe.. try tracing it see if it cancels instantly or after the request
[03:09:28] <mikecmpbll> how might i go about that?
[03:10:41] <harbhub> faraway:  i am making a monte carlo sampling program in js and html for project planning
[03:10:42] <faraway> harbhub: yes (but a long time ago) .. but i think this is a little bit off topic :D  ... but couldn't you solve you problem with this "data-depends-on"  and then searching for the paths ? when you have your logic directly with your input elements
[03:10:55] <harbhub> not sure
[03:11:03] <harbhub> faraway:  there is a problem to solve before this though
[03:11:05] <harbhub> so
[03:11:05] <HughAJWood> mikecmpbll: use firebug, stick a watch on a variable you know should change, add a console.log into the code at various stages to see how far it gets etc, watch in the console when the request dies, and open it up to see what happened
[03:11:10] <harbhub> take a row of inputs
[03:11:14] <harbhub> then
[03:11:17] <harbhub> take
[03:11:18] <mikecmpbll> ok ta HughAJWood, i'll have a look.
[03:11:21] <harbhub> the first input
[03:11:25] <harbhub> and that is its value
[03:11:25] <faraway> harbhub: wait
[03:11:28] <harbhub> the second
[03:11:31] <harbhub> is the first + second
[03:11:43] <harbhub> the third = first + second + third
[03:11:44] <harbhub> and so on
[03:11:50] <faraway> harbhub: it would be realy easyer if you create a kind of simple example in jsfiddle
[03:11:58] <harbhub> ok one sec
[03:12:15] <faraway> harbhub: writing there your comments what should happen when you put ceartain inputs in certain fields
[03:15:30] <harbhub> so
[03:15:33] <harbhub> lets say the values are
[03:15:41] <harbhub> 3  4  6  6  8  1
[03:15:44] <harbhub> in that order
[03:15:49] <harbhub> you want to return
[03:15:52] <harbhub> 3
[03:15:53] <harbhub> 7
[03:15:58] <harbhub> 13
[03:15:59] <harbhub> 19
[03:16:01] <harbhub> 27
[03:16:03] <harbhub> 28
[03:16:08] <harbhub> understand faraway?
[03:17:47] <faraway> harbhub: ok
[03:18:07] <harbhub> lets do
[03:18:16] <harbhub> i am working on my version in a fiddle
[03:22:27] <fatninja> can anyone tell me how to make anchors work on jquery mobile 1.1 ?
[03:26:15] <harbhub> faraway: i got it working
[03:27:34] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/yMcxU/  faraway
[03:27:47] <harbhub> just need to fix the fact that if you don't input anything it displays NaN
[03:27:51] <harbhub> and wont add correctly
[03:27:57] <harbhub> since 4 + NaN = NaN
[03:28:45] <faraway> harbhub: yea that's ok, and you want a generic solution for this
[03:29:02] <harbhub> nono
[03:29:15] <harbhub> i need to know how to make empty inputs equal to the number zero
[03:29:21] <harbhub> for general knowledge
[03:29:27] <harbhub> it is applicable to much of what i will do
[03:29:33] <harbhub> please, how do i make that work
[03:29:36] <harbhub> is it possible?
[03:29:37] <AdamPDotty> if (!isNaN(inputValue)) cfd+= inputValue;
[03:29:46] <harbhub> huh?
[03:30:15] <faraway> harbhub: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/yMcxU/1/
[03:30:17] <harbhub> adampdotty can you fiddle it so i know what you mean?
[03:30:56] <harbhub>         inputValue = isNaN(inputValue)?0:inputValue;
[03:31:00] <harbhub> what does that mean?
[03:31:08] <harbhub> oh
[03:31:10] <harbhub> so
[03:31:22] <harbhub> if it is NaN, then set it to 0
[03:31:24] <AdamPDotty> I like mine more :-)
[03:31:25] <harbhub> :
[03:31:26] <harbhub> else
[03:31:29] <faraway> AdamPDotty: :D
[03:31:29] <AdamPDotty> yes
[03:31:30] <harbhub> inputValue
[03:31:37] <harbhub> adampdotty
[03:31:47] <harbhub> yours doesnt mean anything though (to me) until i see it working
[03:31:52] <harbhub> otherwise, i have no idea the logic
[03:32:02] <faraway> harbhub: then you need to learn js :P
[03:32:04] <harbhub> i understand faraway however, because i can see it
[03:32:12] <harbhub> i am learning as we speak  :)
[03:33:23] <faraway> harbhub: if you look at what AdamPDotty wrote you SOULD really see here to place it, because its just a little "prefix" to a line of yours ;)
[03:36:42] <harbhub> faraway i don't see where or how it makes the value equal 0 if it is empty
[03:37:13] <tocka> hey guys
[03:37:40] <tocka> im kind of lost, im getting some tweets but dont know how to echo them
[03:37:41] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/JbyE9/
[03:37:52] <tocka> should I spin a cycle with each
[03:37:53] <tocka> ?
[03:37:59] <tocka> and then append to a div?
[03:39:19] <faraway> harbhub: it does not make it 0 but it does not add it to cfd, depends on what you need. if you need to display the 0 for this fields, then the you need to use the thing i wrote, if you just want the cfd not to be NaN then the the other thing will work
[03:39:52] <harbhub> need the zero
[03:40:04] <harbhub> because it is 0 times recorded
[03:41:22] <smellynoser> eg
[03:53:30] <harbhub> guys i need help faraway adampdotty
[03:53:33] <harbhub> i want to find the mean
[03:53:35] <harbhub> of those inputs
[03:53:39] <harbhub> then find the variance
[03:53:57] <AdamPDotty> thats Math
[03:53:59] <faraway> harbhub: that is not really a jquery question
[03:54:20] <harbhub> well i know how to do it by hand, i need the jquery to do it
[03:54:43] <faraway> harbhub: you need javascript to do it, not jquery
[03:57:48] <brass> what is by hand?
[03:59:01] <tocka> how can I execute this ajax request every 30 seconds? and that the first time the url would be normal and then it would be url=data.refresh.url
[03:59:02] <tocka> ?
[03:59:30] <brass> You could set a timeout for every 30 seconds on a function
[03:59:44] <tocka> Right and how about them urls?
[03:59:51] <tocka> im getting tweets btw
[04:00:08] <brass> then set a global variable, once the global variable equals a set value and you check for that value, then the url would be differently
[04:00:14] <brass> basicly after it ran the first time the variabel would be set
[04:00:26] <tocka> lets try
[04:01:07] <abhishek> hi
[04:01:31] <brass> the if condition could simply check the typeof of the variable, if it does not equal undefined, then that means it has already ran once. Then the url variable would need to be set differently
[04:01:33] <abhishek> I want a flyout menu like amazon.com
[04:01:39] <abhishek> css is ready
[04:02:07] <abhishek> but i don't know which jquery function make it dynamic, i mean flyout'
[04:02:46] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/yMcxU/ faraway i know its javascript issue but what am i doing wrong?
[04:02:58] <brass> abhishek, you would do some type of predefined, if not create your own animation on the mouseover event.
[04:03:08] <AdamPDotty> hmm, I see nothing there that requires scripting
[04:03:12] <abhishek> requirement is category menu must be visible when page is loaded first time
[04:03:47] <abhishek> after that when user clicks on any link,page refresheh and menu must be dissapear
[04:04:05] <abhishek> menu is visible only when user clicks on home link
[04:04:10] <harbhub> adampdotty:  check out that fiddle i just posted if you can
[04:04:24] <brass> sounds like you need to hire, or go find a open source menu
[04:05:32] <abhishek> no everything i designed with css
[04:05:33] <harbhub> fixed it
[04:06:11] <abhishek> but the problem is i don't which jquery functions load the css of element first time
[04:06:12] <faraway> harbhub: sorry ... i do helping while i work, so you need to find out yourself if it is not really a jquery realted question.
[04:06:22] <harbhub> gotcha
[04:06:25] <harbhub> i figured it out
[04:06:27] <harbhub> with some trial/error
[04:07:07] <abhishek> and when I click jquery change the css and many dissapear but page refresher and menu will appera which i don't want
[04:07:58] <abhishek> hi brass
[04:08:03] <abhishek> please reply
[04:08:43] <brass> It's hard to see what is happening. Maybe go to fiddle.com and put your cod ein
[04:08:57] <brass> sorry jsfiddle.net
[04:11:02] <harbhub> ya i havent figured out variance, however
[04:15:03] <chrisbuchholz> Hey guys
[04:15:10] <bid> hi, is there a way to get the full url inside ajax object i want url + data inside my success:function(){}... ?
[04:15:32] <tocka> how can I make that the tweets would show up as tickers, one by one ? http://jsfiddle.net/BTfCT/2/
[04:15:51] <chrisbuchholz> How come i get a 404 status when i use $.getJSON()? If i look in the developer tools of chrome, i can see that i get the correct response back, but it says its 404 and therefore it doesnt call my done-method
[04:16:32] <AdamPDotty> 404 is a correct response
[04:17:29] <chrisbuchholz> AdamPDotty: yes, but not when i url exists
[04:17:34] <chrisbuchholz> the*
[04:17:54] <chrisbuchholz> AdamPDotty: the php script it calls handles correctly and gives me the correct output
[04:17:58] <chrisbuchholz> so why the 404?
[04:18:29] <termite> tocka: so you mean on tweet shows up at a time?
[04:20:58] <termite> tocka:like a stock ticker?
[04:21:02] <tocka> yeah
[04:21:08] <tocka> but I want it to show only 1 by one
[04:21:23] <tocka> thinking about adding everything to an array
[04:21:28] <tocka> and then showing
[04:21:33] <termite> moving left to right?
[04:21:37] <chrisbuchholz> any ideas why it resolves to that?
[04:21:37] <termite> or right to left
[04:21:37] <tocka> no
[04:21:42] <tocka> top bottom
[04:21:48] <tocka> just like twitter had live
[04:21:50] <tocka> tweets
[04:21:54] <bid> see if tweeter can return only one item for each call...
[04:22:03] <tocka> bid it can
[04:22:07] <tocka> but whats the point?
[04:22:14] <bid> but this is a bit over head
[04:22:16] <tocka> there is a limit i think of 150 calls an hour
[04:22:36] <termite> make a stack and have one function populate it and the other pull it off
[04:22:46] <termite> trigger the function with setInterval
[04:22:59] <tocka> termite could you give me an exmaple?
[04:23:03] <termite> sure
[04:24:38] <tocka> thank you
[04:24:59] <tocka> this is what im going for basically, the same effect at least
[04:25:19] <tocka> lets say look for tweets containing #apple
[04:27:25] <harbhub> how do i join javascript chat?
[04:27:27] <harbhub>  /msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
[04:27:33] <harbhub> is nickserv my username?
[04:27:40] <harbhub> of i literally write it that way?
[04:28:06] <harbhub> someone i need help solving variance
[04:28:13] <brass> no no
[04:28:21] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/yMcxU/3/
[04:28:25] <harbhub> brass how?
[04:28:28] <brass> password = your unique password, and youremail@example.com is your email
[04:29:05] <brass> I am pretty sure #javascript on freenode is INVITE only
[04:33:16] <mikecmpbll> pretty sure it's not.
[04:34:13] <harbhub> brass what about my username?
[04:36:14] <termite> tocka:http://jsfiddle.net/BTfCT/8/
[04:36:18] <brass> you don't need to put it in there. I haven't used freenode irc services, I use to be on DALnet, but that was only 12 years ago

[04:36:59] <tocka> termite omg thanks <33333
[04:39:50] <harbhub> ya so i need help
[04:40:02] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/yMcxU/3/  variance?
[04:40:59] <harbhub> how would i put those input values in an array?
[04:41:31] <bid> guys, is there a way to grab $.ajax({url:'foo',data:'bar',success:function(res){ is there a way to get the url and the data?  }})
[04:42:53] <mikecmpbll> what do you mean get the url and the data?
[04:43:11] <tocka> termite im getting an error "tweet is undefined"
[04:43:12] <tocka> O_o
[04:43:13] <bid> need the value of them
[04:43:43] <termite> tock a add an if (tweets.length)
[04:43:53] <termite> tweets is empty
[04:43:58] <tocka> right
[04:44:43] <mikecmpbll> my_url = "http://blah/"; my_data = "â€¦"; $.ajax({url: my_url, data: my_data, success:function(res){ alert(my_url + " " + my_data }})
[04:44:49] <termite> bid: I believe the success gets back 3 parameters and the third is an object with the url in it
[04:44:52] <bid> data:{foo='bar',bar='foo'},url='http://google.com' i want to represent the call http://google.com?foo=bar&bar=foo, i am sure there is a way to grab it without parsing it agian as $.ajax is doing it already
[04:44:53] <mikecmpbll> or no?
[04:45:08] <bid> termite thanks
[04:45:39] <harbhub> still cant talk in javascript channel
[04:45:39] <harbhub> weird
[04:46:12] <termite> harbhub: what's your issue input values into an array
[04:46:26] <harbhub> bid how'd you do that
[04:46:55] <harbhub> termite:  i want to grab input values and make an array out of them
[04:47:06] <harbhub> them use functions to get the variance
[04:47:08] <harbhub> or
[04:47:21] <harbhub> just find a way to take each value and get the variage, either way
[04:47:27] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/yMcxU/4/
[04:47:33] <bid> var a={}; $('input').each(function(elm,sd){a[e.name] = e.val();})
[04:47:34] <harbhub> it just isn't working i dont think
[04:48:08] <Cork> uh...
[04:48:10] <bid> e=elm
[04:48:15] <harbhub> thought so lol
[04:48:17] <Cork> bid: why don't you just use serializeArray?
[04:48:57] <bid> posibale, thats the first thing that pops in my mind
[04:49:28] <harbhub> what i am doing is making a monte carlo sampling tool in javascript
[04:49:37] <Cork> var values = $('form').serializeArray()
[04:49:37] <harbhub> i need help though
[04:50:10] <harbhub> cork
[04:50:20] <harbhub> i need to make empty values = 0
[04:50:24] <harbhub> the number 0
[04:50:36] <Cork> empty?
[04:50:41] <Cork> what do you mean empty?
[04:50:43] <harbhub> nope like the integer
[04:50:53] <harbhub> if i submit without filling in an input
[04:50:57] <harbhub> its value should be 0
[04:51:02] <Cork> why?
[04:51:11] <Cork> thats better handled on the server side
[04:51:15] <bid> have the server side take care of it
[04:51:22] <Cork> you would have to send a lot of unneeded data
[04:51:58] <harbhub> do you guys know monte carloe sampling?
[04:52:00] <termite> and what if happens if someone want to put in 0 as valid input
[04:52:05] <harbhub> cumulative frequency diagrams?
[04:52:34] <Cork> harbhub: just fall back to if the value doens't exist its 0
[04:52:46] <harbhub> thats what i was doing
[04:52:52] <harbhub> but i need to calc the variance
[04:52:53] <Cork> on the server side
[04:53:38] <Cork> harbhub: or are you saying your doing this in js?
[04:53:43] <termite> or you could just set the value=0 in the html
[04:53:56] <harbhub> i'm doing this all in js
[04:54:02] <harbhub> i set the value to 0
[04:54:04] <Cork> aha
[04:54:28] <Cork> harbhub: just throwing this out there, but a common way to do this is to have a hidden field with the default value
[04:54:47] <Cork> then you will get the default if the other doens't exist, and the entered value if it is
[04:54:58] <Cork> but, thats up to you
[04:55:14] <harbhub> well look
[04:55:20] <harbhub> lets say i have a row of input
[04:55:27] <harbhub> each one is really a frequency
[04:55:28] <Cork> harbhub: anyway, ya you would have to do the search your self if you want that, cause serialize explicitly exclude empty input fields
[05:18:05] <allX> hi there, i have a curious problem. i extended the jquery.ui tabs using the widgetfactory, and it works fine in general, but when i try to rotate the tabs via the rotate function it stops at the second tab
[05:19:14] <allX> it works fine with the regular jquery.ui tabs and i have thrown out everything in my extended tabs, escept the create functions which just does this._tabify(true); like in the original
[05:20:12] <allX> so as far as i am concerned there should be no difference at all between the two, but mine doesnt work, any ideas? ;)
[05:24:08] <bjensen> I do an ajax request to the server using $.ajax() and the server returns a pdf file, which I hope the browser will open. Nothing happens though. Impossible task or?
[05:25:38] <termite> bjensen: it's not opening because browsers open readers based on mime type in the http request
[05:25:47] <tocka> maybe anyone has an idea is it possible to count tweets per minute for a hashtag and what would be the best way to do it?
[05:25:53] <anli_> yes, you need to set the document url to that pdf
[05:27:41] <bjensen> termite: this is the date being sent from firebug: http://pastie.org/4771791
[05:28:57] <termite> tocka: keep an array that tracks the hashtag name, count
[05:29:15] <termite> you can calculate it from there if you are refreshing he count every minute
[05:29:52] <bjensen> termite: but I can't set the mime type in the $.ajax request?
[05:31:06] <termite> bjensen: use window.open("_blank",url) instead of ajax
[05:31:13] <termite> it will open it in a new window
[05:31:19] <termite> the pdf that is
[05:32:21] <bjensen> termite: right..but the point is I am creating a dynamic document, it has no url, I send off the ajax request with arguments and return a pdf document
[05:33:36] <jayar> $('input[type="file"]').change(function(){ var file_name = $(this).val(); $("#pic").append("<img src="&file_name&" />") });
[05:33:38] <termite> bjensen: just try it
[05:33:39] <bjensen> termite: seams like its possible if you believe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2186562/post-to-server-receive-pdf-deliver-to-user-w-jquery
[05:33:45] <jayar> how do i get that to return a filename and not "0" ?
[05:34:07] <jayar> or path
[05:35:09] <jayar> to display the image you selected

[05:35:30] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[05:36:12] <bot-t> AdamPDotty, #1150 (Imagebox corrections proposal) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 5 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1150
[05:36:19] <bjensen> termite: well I see what you are trying to do. I could do window.open("_blank, "/get_user_info&foo=1&description=fdjsfjkdsjkfdjksf". However the problem is that I am making a letter template so the description can be very long, there is a limit as how long the parameters can be
[05:38:20] <termite> bjensen: you can use $.post if you want you just need to make sure you don't cache the results
[05:39:41] <HughAJWood> bjensen: termites suggestion is spot on
[05:43:49] <termite> bjensen: if you want to try the Stack Overflow thing you could try adding a headers:"" in the ajax settings and adding Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="whatever.pdf"
[05:44:07] <termite> if it works let me know
[05:45:32] <lizz> hey guys how can i improve this code for form validation http://pastie.org/4771876
[05:48:08] <hendedav> good afternoon everyone.  I have an issue I'm trying to figure out, but am failing to do so.  Currently I have two div's on a form and one of them I would like to use slideToggle to make it appear and disappear.  There is another div below it that needs to occupy the space the previous div had before it was toggled.  Here's what I've got so far...
[05:48:23] <hendedav> $(document).ready(function() {
[05:48:24] <hendedav>   $('#divTitle').on('click', function() {
[05:48:26] <hendedav>     $('#divDetails').slideToggle('slow');
[05:48:28] <hendedav>     $('#divContents').animate({marginTop:'toggle',display:'block'},'slow');
[05:48:29] <hendedav>   })
[05:48:30] <hendedav> });
[05:48:38] <hendedav> any thoughts?
[05:48:53] <hendedav> basically the second div disappears after the toggle is completed
[05:48:59] <hendedav> and it doesn't need to
[05:49:13] <hendedav> hence the "display:'block'" attempt
[05:49:18] <bjensen> HughAJWood: I'm sure it is, Im just trying to understand it. He said don't use ajax and now he suggests using $.post..which is ajax :-..
[05:50:12] <HughAJWood> bjensen: postMessage is a messaging in javascript between open windows
[05:51:59] <AdamPDotty> I do not really know, but should not the code inside {} be valid css?
[05:53:17] <bjensen> HughAJWood: so how would that work/
[05:53:41] <lizz> what might be wrong in this piece of code?
[05:53:51] <lizz> http://pastie.org/4762442http://pastie.org/4762442
[05:53:54] <HughAJWood> bjensen: well how cross browser are you aiming for, postMessage is new in the schemes of things
[05:54:24] <bjensen> HughAJWood: IE9, FF And Chrome
[05:54:48] <jayar> why is this returning 0? var file_name = $(this).val();
[05:55:35] <AdamPDotty> lizz: count brackets
[05:55:53] <HughAJWood> bjensen: FF3+, IE8+, Chrome, Safari(5?), Opera10+ so you are good there
[05:56:03] <lizz> im checking i have all brackets
[05:56:30] <bjensen> cool, so how would it work? I do openWindow(url, "_blank"), $.post() ?
[05:56:44] <AdamPDotty> hmm, shouldnt the function have curly brackets?
[05:57:09] <HughAJWood> bjenson: google window.postMessage, and jquery postMessage and post, you could use post or postMessage, post will require synchronization though
[05:58:23] <HughAJWood> bjensen: http://javascript.info/tutorial/cross-window-messaging-with-postmessage and http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/postmessage, to use post you will need to post the information and pick it up in the other window
[05:58:55] <AdamPDotty> no semicolon in line 33
[05:59:06] <AdamPDotty> 34
[06:02:31] <HughAJWood> AdampDotty: that the line with }) without the ; on it?
[06:03:28] <lizz> gosh
[06:03:33] <lizz> still not working
[06:04:30] <AdamPDotty> any error message?
[06:04:40] <AdamPDotty> are you sure, you call those functions?
[06:05:46] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  look http://pastie.org/4771981
[06:07:48] <AdamPDotty> thats a bit more order, but still no curly brackets for the second function and a missing semicolon
[06:08:05] <DeltaHeavy> How long does it take to set up groupon?
[06:08:42] <pangelovski> does anyone else experience issues opening apple maps on ios6 when clicking on a maps link?
[06:08:55] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I was wondering how long it takes to set up groupon for a deal or two on a website. It looks like it shouldn't take more than an hour to figure out and get working but idk.
[06:09:43] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[06:09:49] <PlasmaBunny> what is the best way to hog memory in jquery?
[06:10:13] <HughAJWood> PlasmaBunny: define hog memory
[06:10:18] <PlasmaBunny> HughAJWood: consume memory
[06:11:12] <HughAJWood> PlasmaBunny: Array joins do it in javascript
[06:11:29] <PlasmaBunny> HughAJWood: what about while (1) i++;
[06:11:55] <HughAJWood> PlasmaBunny: that just eats cpu cycles
[06:11:57] <PlasmaBunny> or while (1) document.write('<iframe src="http://upyachka.ru"></iframe>');
[06:12:57] <DeltaHeavy> var i=0,x=new Array(); while (true) { x[i] = "Crazy long string"; i++; }
[06:13:19] <PlasmaBunny> is it the most efficient way possible?
[06:13:27] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  what about now http://pastie.org/4772017
[06:13:27] <DeltaHeavy> You're going to hit caps from the browser and OS though I'd assume
[06:13:33] <PlasmaBunny> yep
[06:13:39] <PlasmaBunny> this is not acceptable
[06:13:47] <DeltaHeavy> And idk, give it a try lol. It'll at least crash the page
[06:14:09] <PlasmaBunny> i need to crash browser/OS
[06:14:22] <HughAJWood> PlasmaBunny: I would create a 1024byte string and make 1024 element arrays with a delay so you can keep control and it doesn't lock up
[06:14:40] * AdamPDotty wants his semicolon
[06:14:56] <DeltaHeavy> HughAJWood: Why only 1024B?
[06:15:07] <HughAJWood> PlasmaBunny: the browser won't crash, you will eventually get an exception
[06:15:33] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  which lin
[06:15:37] <lizz> ?
[06:15:40] <AdamPDotty> 30 now
[06:15:41] <HughAJWood> 1024byte string is easy to trace, but I am looking at the perspective of a controlled test
[06:16:59] <lizz> done
[06:17:03] <lizz> lets see
[06:17:36] <mazzachre> Hmmm... interesting problem... I just broke a page here because I rearranged some of the javascript initialization.. Apparently one of the functions rely on another function being run before it can be run.. How do I do that?!
[06:17:37] <HughAJWood> AdamPDotty: can you make it into a fiddle please
[06:18:05] <lizz> nothing grrrrrrrrrrrrr =/
[06:18:12] <AdamPDotty> Hugh: that sounds dirty
[06:19:22] <HughAJWood> mazzachre: you define things framework at the top using plugins modules etc that use javascript, in page javascript at the bottom, you run anything that can be run as the page is loading first, and then use a ready to run the start of the rest of it.
[06:19:34] <HughAJWood> AdamPDotty: http://jsfiddle.net
[06:19:40] <HughAJWood> :3
[06:20:21] <mazzachre> HughAJWood: Ya, my problem is I can't do this... as stuff is build out of jsp modules... And I have no control over the order :/
[06:21:10] <HughAJWood> mazzachre: you then define the things the modules require at the top in the head and have to ignore the rule of at the bottom, then anything that runs on the modules goes at the bottom of the page and does run until document ready
[06:21:18] <AdamPDotty> el violin por lizz
[06:21:39] <lizz> que? jaja
[06:22:01] * AdamPDotty points to Hugh
[06:22:21] <AdamPDotty> a complete example on jsfiddle.net might help, lizz
[06:22:36] <lizz> ok
[06:22:42] <AdamPDotty> in your code the functions are not called
[06:22:46] <hendedav> anyone have any thoughts on the disappearing div?
[06:23:11] <AdamPDotty> dav: did you check marginTop works at all?
[06:23:49] * AdamPDotty should use punctuation
[06:23:52] <Germanaz0> hello, I have some issues with window.location.href on IE9
[06:24:02] <Germanaz0> someone knows how is the correct ussage of that ?
[06:26:16] <Germanaz0> hello
[06:27:13] <HughAJWood> Germanaz: are you trying to set the location of the window or retrieve it?
[06:27:30] <Germanaz0> I just need a forward to another page HughAJWood
[06:27:43] <Germanaz0> window.location.href = 'New URL'
[06:27:55] <Germanaz0> but is not working on IE
[06:29:15] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  http://jsfiddle.net/Vkpax/
[06:30:04] <hendedav> AdamPDotty: yes currently the code works as required, but at the end of the toggle, the divContents disappears
[06:30:37] <hendedav> I want the divDetails to disappear and it currently does at the end of the slideToggle
[06:30:39] <HughAJWood> Germanaz0: That will be a caching issue, most likely. Are you using Ajax on the page?
[06:31:07] <Germanaz0> nope
[06:32:37] <Germanaz0> is window.location.href correct to forward for IE ?
[06:32:51] <HughAJWood> Germanaz0: use window.location = 'new url' see if that works out, if not try and append a query string to see if it is a caching issue,
[06:33:05] <Germanaz0> ok
[06:34:33] <AdamPDotty> Germanaz0; it should work in MSIE9, I rather doubt MSIE7
[06:34:34] <Germanaz0> lemme see
[06:34:45] <Germanaz0> it was for IE9
[06:34:48] <Germanaz0> got that error
[06:38:26] <lizz> grr
[06:38:57] <HughAJWood> Germanaz0: you got an error?
[06:39:09] <Germanaz0> windows property is not defined
[06:39:11] <Germanaz0> it says
[06:39:21] <Germanaz0> maybe could be another script
[06:39:25] <Germanaz0> that is broking my forward
[06:39:46] <AdamPDotty> sounds a bit like right management problem
[06:39:53] <AdamPDotty> are you doing it in an iframe?
[06:41:02] <Germanaz0> no AdamPDotty
[06:41:17] <Germanaz0> just I check cookies, if a cookie is setted, then forward
[06:41:21] <Germanaz0> with an interval
[06:43:06] <AdamPDotty> I had similiar problems, when a script set document.domain, but should not happen in newer versions.
[06:44:19] <ravenzz> doesn't on works for mouse events?
[06:44:40] <ravenzz> I mean parent.on('mouseenter', '.foo', function () { })
[06:45:51] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/fGhdA/ http://jsfiddle.net/fGhdA/1/
[06:48:18] <lizz> um
[06:48:25] <HughAJWood> ravenzz: yes on works with mouseenter looking at fiddles now
[06:48:38] <ravenzz> uh?
[06:48:40] <AdamPDotty> ravenzz: with hide() the span is gone, nothing for your mouse to enter
[06:48:55] <ravenzz> the span is gone
[06:48:58] <AdamPDotty> maybe try CSS
[06:48:59] <ravenzz> not the parent
[06:49:40] <AdamPDotty> the selector is 'span'
[06:49:41] <ravenzz> the second version works, but I have to rebind it when I load content in ajax
[06:49:54] <ravenzz> wait there is an error in the 1st fiddle
[06:50:12] <ravenzz> ah
[06:50:14] <ravenzz> sure
[06:50:29] <AdamPDotty> omit it?
[06:51:18] <ravenzz> what?
[06:53:01] <ravenzz> so can't it toggle?
[06:53:37] <AdamPDotty> like .on('mouseenter', func)
[06:54:15] <ravenzz> well it is the span that has to toggle
[06:54:21] <ravenzz> not the container
[06:54:37] <AdamPDotty> the span toggles, the parent triggers
[06:55:04] <AdamPDotty> easier: span:hover{display:block;}
[06:55:07] <ravenzz> sure, the problem as you said is that the span is hidden so it can't be selected
[06:56:21] <AdamPDotty> "display:none" does more than hiding
[06:56:50] <AdamPDotty> hiding would be: "visibility:hidden"
[06:57:11] <bid> hi, jqXHR.origUrl is not set... was it replaced in the current version of jquery? (talking about ajax success : function paramters
[06:58:07] <ravenzz> AdamPDotty yes I got the point
[06:59:04] <ravenzz> $('.container span').hide() and .container:hover span { display: block !important }
[06:59:08] <ravenzz> should work then
[06:59:33] <Gho5t> I'm experience an issue where when I prepend a div with content that already exists in my dom e.g. $('div').prepend('#foo'), it prepends it fine but also removes the original version of it. Is that the way these manipulation functions work in my case?
[06:59:59] <ravenzz> I have a meeting, gotta go. thank you anyway
[07:01:04] <hendedav> anyone have any thoughts on the disappearing div?
[07:01:25] <lizz> i think i have a problem with the submithandler
[07:02:39] <Gho5t> Let me restate. If you prepend an element already in your DOM, such as $('#foo').append('#bar'), does it remove #bar's original instance or will you end up with 2 instances of #bar?
[07:05:15] <hariom> I get this error when I use dialog: TypeError: $("<div></div>").html("This dialog will show every time!").dialog is not a function [Break On This Error] 	.dialog({
[07:05:43] <hariom> I have checked $.ui.dialog and dialog plugin is installed
[07:05:48] <AdamPDotty> Ghost: in my app it removes it
[07:05:50] <eip56> mornin
[07:06:28] <Gho5t> yeah I just made a fiddle and see it doing that too
[07:06:32] <Gho5t> kinda odd
[07:06:45] <AdamPDotty> well as it has an ID, it should be unique
[07:06:54] <Gho5t> I'm sure it would do it with a class too
[07:06:58] <Gho5t> let me check
[07:06:58] <eip56> Two questions to start off this day: 1st validation plugin recommendations? 2nd: How to I compare a js variable to a regex in js? I assume there is a function i just bearly started utilizing regex tho
[07:07:19] <Gho5t> yep
[07:07:26] <Gho5t> I'm not saying it's a bug or anything
[07:07:35] <hariom> HOw to fix dialog error?
[07:07:39] <Gho5t> but it is strange that it makes that leap
[07:07:46] <hariom> I am just using very simple dialog example for learning
[07:07:51] <AdamPDotty> eip56: 2. text.match()
[07:08:20] <hariom> I get this error when I use dialog: TypeError: $("<div></div>").html("This dialog will show every time!").dialog is not a function [Break On This Error] 	.dialog({
[07:08:42] <Gho5t> ah: If a single element selected this way is inserted elsewhere, it will be moved into the target (not cloned):
[07:08:57] <eip56> AdamPDotty  Thanks isn't there a test() to? looking on the mozilla.org site have yet to find the man pages
[07:09:23] <Gho5t> Important: If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target after the first.
[07:09:35] <Gho5t> kinda odd
[07:09:44] <AdamPDotty> hmm yes, test gives boolean, match gives matches, I believe
[07:10:21] <AdamPDotty> ghost: I wont remember it next time
[07:11:05] <Gho5t> hah yeah
[07:11:09] <Gho5t> not really intuitive
[07:13:31] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  im getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'validate'
[07:13:54] <exit2> I have a scrollable DIV that has items in it that are draggable and each item can be dragged to a JS calendar below.  The issue I'm having is that when clicking the item then dragging/dropping it down to the calendar the DIV that the items are in is scrolling down - anyway to prevent this from happening but still allowing the user to scroll through items in the DIV?
[07:13:55] <Anticom> hi all
[07:14:12] <AdamPDotty> hmm lizz, then a plugin is missing
[07:14:17] <Anticom> how do i get data out of .ajax's success-method?
[07:15:35] <AdamPDotty> anticom: data is the argument to the function
[07:15:42] <termite> Anticom: success:function(data){{}
[07:15:50] <Anticom> nooo, wait i'll fiddle
[07:16:06] * AdamPDotty runs
[07:17:26] <Anticom> AdamPDotty , termite http://jsfiddle.net/Lqg3z/
[07:17:34] <AdamPDotty> exit2: first idea: ondragstart set variable; when variable set -> ignore scrolling; on dragend unset variable
[07:18:18] <termite> Anticom: so what is for question about the fiddle
[07:18:42] <Anticom> termite read last comment in the fiddle
[07:18:55] <Anticom> because of the scope of data i can't simply "return data.success;"
[07:19:19] <Anticom> i've tried assigning it to a variable of higher scope but it didn't work, probably because it's asynchronus i guess
[07:19:59] <termite> Anticom: yeah it's async what needs to know the state?
[07:20:18] <lizz> yayyyyy
[07:20:20] <lizz> i did it
[07:20:21] <Anticom> the method that calls the validation wrapper, since i wanted to avoid redundant code ;)
[07:20:26] <lizz> =)
[07:20:28] <AdamPDotty> CONGRATS Lizz
[07:20:50] <AdamPDotty> Â¡Felicitaciones!
[07:21:22] <Anticom> termite i mean i could store it e.g. as html5-data in body or something like that
[07:21:28] <Anticom> but that's just... urgh :/
[07:21:54] <termite> Anticom:  Break your calling function into two different functions one that calls the validation and one that runs on success
[07:21:57] <exit2> AdamPDotty: word, I'll try that
[07:22:29] <lizz> AdamPDotty:  hablas espaÃ±ol?
[07:22:31] <Anticom> termite ??
[07:22:33] <Anticom> don't get it
[07:23:00] <Anticom> thing is, that different triggers cause that validationwrapper to be called, so i can't register the same success method for them
[07:23:07] <Anticom> because following up actions differ
[07:23:09] <dragongun100> hello everybody :d
[07:23:16] <Anticom> hi dragongun100
[07:23:28] <dragongun100> can anione speak german ?
[07:23:32] <dragongun100> anyone*
[07:23:36] <termite> Anticom:  do you know how to use  a closure?
[07:23:36] <Anticom> jep, at #jquery-de ;)
[07:23:44] <dragongun100> ok ok thx xD
[07:24:08] <AdamPDotty> Germans can (I heard)
[07:24:11] <Anticom> termite not quite sure... could you fiddle it please?
[07:24:21] <Anticom> AdamPDotty you don't say! :D
[07:26:51] <efphe_> hello, could you help me to find a right selector? I'm trying different solutions, no luch. The selector should work on div having the class Foo and data-bar != 'Baz'
[07:26:55] <efphe_> could you help me?
[07:27:43] <xec> div.Foo[data-bar!='Baz']
[07:27:56] <Anticom> damn, you were faster xec :D
[07:28:23] * xec flexes
[07:28:27] <efphe_> xec, thank you
[07:28:29] <Anticom> haha
[07:30:08] <xec> i wonder if it's possible to make the bot pull up the docs for attribute not equal selector, i doubt "?!=" would work...
[07:30:49] <xec> ?attributeNotEqual
[07:30:50] <bot-t> [attribute!="value"]: Select elements that either don't have the specified attribute, or do have the specified attribute but not with a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[07:30:53] <xec> woot
[07:31:29] <xec> efphe_: check out the notes on that link
[07:32:13] <xec> efphe_: you're probably better off with $('.Foo').not('[data-bar="Baz"]')
[07:32:23] <lizz> well for some reason i need to hit submit 2 times in order to submit
[07:32:25] <lizz> weird
[07:32:28] <termite> Anticom: Hmm hard to fiddle sounds like you are running into multi score issue
[07:32:32] <efphe_> k
[07:32:34] <termite> scope
[07:33:12] <termite> Anticom: are you using objects?
[07:33:37] <alien_talk> hey i'm trying to add a link around an image being loaded into a modal:  this doesn't seem to work: http://pastie.org/4772440
[07:33:51] <Anticom> termite objects where? data in success method is a JSON object, yep
[07:33:58] <hendedav> good afternoon everyone. I have an issue I'm trying to figure out, but am failing to do so. Currently I have two div's on a form and one of them I would like to use slideToggle to make it appear and disappear. There is another div below it that needs to occupy the space the previous div had before it was toggled, but after the toggle is completed the second div disappears. Can the second div...
[07:33:59] <hendedav> ...be set to not disappear? Here's what I've got so far...
[07:34:04] <hendedav> $(document).ready(function() {
[07:34:06] <hendedav>   $('#divTitle').on('click', function() {
[07:34:07] <hendedav>     $('#divDetails').slideToggle('slow');
[07:34:09] <hendedav>     $('#divContents').animate({marginTop:'toggle',display:'block'},'slow');
[07:34:10] <Anticom> omg stop it
[07:34:10] <hendedav>   })
[07:34:12] <hendedav> });
[07:34:14] <Anticom> !jsfiddle
[07:34:16] <Anticom> :O
[07:34:19] <Anticom> no bot?
[07:34:21] <termite> ?demo
[07:34:22] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:34:28] <Anticom> thank's termite :D
[07:35:09] <xec> alien_talk: when you're .append()ing you're adding DOM elements (not dumping strings to the original html)
[07:35:18] <xec> alien_talk: that means the </a> is already inferred
[07:35:30] <Anticom> termite think i've sovled it using a little workaround
[07:35:45] <xec> alien_talk: so what you could do is on line 7: $('#modal-body a').append(img)
[07:35:46] <termite> Anticom: ok I was about to do some crazy js
[07:35:58] <Anticom> termite go ahead... want to see your solution if you don't mind
[07:36:05] <alien_talk> xec thanks!!
[07:36:21] <termite> Anticom: haaha I just killed he fiddle
[07:36:25] <xec> alien_talk: even better, see ?wrap
[07:36:25] <bot-t> alien_talk, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[07:36:39] <Anticom> fu
[07:36:50] <xec> alien_talk: then you could just wrap the <a> around the img
[07:37:23] * alien_talk implements wrap instead
[07:39:11] <termite> Anticom: Look into closures it's what you want to use but it's kinda hard to explain in IRC
[07:39:58] <alien_talk> xec: http://paintacquaint.com/  i just implemented the wrap, if you click on one of the images it pops up a modal and if you click the image it links to the story :DD
[07:43:15] <xec> alien_talk: smooth :)
[07:43:23] <alien_talk> :D
[07:44:49] <hendedav> per your request bot-t http://staging.cliquesoft.org/test/
[07:44:58] <hendedav> click the "whatever title"
[07:44:59] <boodle> I have a div tag with text (a username) and then a hidden list, all inside. When I try to change the text via $("#mydiv).text("newuser"); it destroys then hidden list.. how can I do this to preserve the list ?
[07:47:29] <HughAJWood> boodle: can you do a fiddle so we can see exactly how you have it setup please
[07:48:29] <boodle> HughAJWood: solved my own problem. Just need to wrap the username in another div to isolate it better (doh!)
[07:48:40] <HughAJWood> okay :)
[07:50:08] * AdamPDotty wraps boodle
[07:57:43] <hendedav> any thoughts on the disappearing div?
[08:07:46] <hendedav> has my problem stumped the jquery support???!!! :)
[08:08:52] <arielserafini> hendedav, most people are working or doing other things, they'll help you when/if they can
[08:10:20] <dragongun100> evryone can speak german ???
[08:10:33] <dragongun100> can somebody speak german??
[08:10:37] <hendedav> thanks, arielserafini - I was quick to get jumped on about not using jsfiddle or providing an example, and then nobody wants to help once I do so
[08:10:59] <dragongun100> can somebody speak german?
[08:11:17] <bindi> nein
[08:11:18] <arielserafini> hendedav, that's just a general guideline, having a jsfiddle link will make it easier for someone to try and help
[08:11:36] <arielserafini> dragongun100, just try asking in english, your english skills will not be judged :)
[08:11:40] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[08:11:58] <Aristata> dragongun100: schweigen
[08:12:06] <hendedav> areielserafini, I understand and that's why I didn't complain and just got it done
[08:12:18] <hendedav> :)
[08:13:53] <Mateo_> I have an inline element with text. When the container is small, line-breaks appears, which is normal. I would like to wrap every created line with span, to apply a css to themâ€¦ But i can't find how to ! Any idea please ?
[08:14:56] <Aristata> Mateo_:  You want the same broken line to have different selectors on each new line?
[08:15:13] <Mateo_> Aristata: nope, just a span :)
[08:15:27] <Aristata> span/selector whatever
[08:15:38] <Aristata> That's what you want?
[08:16:33] <Mateo_> I'd like <div class="test">This is my line</div>  with break between is and my, to become <div class="test"><span class="line">This is</span> <span class="line">my line</span></div>

[08:17:47] <mikecmpbll> sounds rather impossible to me
[08:17:54] <mikecmpbll> it would have to change as the window gets bigger/smaller?
[08:18:14] <Mateo_> mikecmpbll: nope, just on load
[08:18:20] <mikecmpbll> i see.
[08:18:38] <Mateo_> mikecmpbll: that's the problem, i can't see how it could be done :s
[08:19:21] <mikecmpbll> there's probably a better solution to whatever the original problem is
[08:19:23] <Guest63384> can someone speak german pls? i need help
[08:19:27] <mikecmpbll> what are you trying to achieve?
[08:19:36] <mikecmpbll> with the span
[08:19:38] <Aristata> Guest12039:  Ask your question or shut up
[08:19:59] <mikecmpbll> chill out Aristata.
[08:20:47] <Aristata> I'd rather not, this guy is clogging my window asking every minute who speaks german
[08:20:50] <mikecmpbll> my bad, guess he was the guy spamming earlier
[08:21:09] <mikecmpbll> i see, i see.
[08:21:11] <termite> If you can't speak english use google translate.
[08:21:21] <termite> Wenn Sie nicht Englisch sprechen Nutzung google translate.
[08:21:32] <Guest63384> google translator ist stupid
[08:21:33] <Guest63384> xD
[08:22:05] <Mateo_> mikecmpbll: i'm doing a fiddle
[08:22:18] <mikecmpbll> Mateo_: good-o.
[08:22:38] <diverdude> Is there some way of getting a notification (some event) when clearTimer is called to delete a certain timer set by window.setInterval()?
[08:24:01] <termite> diverdude: you can make a custom one that your code triggers
[08:24:31] <Guest63384> Kann irgendjemand Deutsch ??
[08:24:35] <diverdude> termite: mm how can i do that?
[08:25:19] <termite> diverdude:http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ search for custom
[08:25:34] <Mateo_> mikecmpbll: http://jsfiddle.net/Ha9aT/
[08:26:10] <Mateo_> mike, as you can see, the end of each line, expect the last has a trouble with padding :)
[08:26:47] <Mateo_> mikecmpbll: same thing with the beginning of the lines
[08:28:42] <mikecmpbll> i'm not sure i understand what you're trying to achieve, Mateo_ .
[08:28:46] <termite> Mateo_: this is because words are not clipped
[08:31:49] <termite> Mateo_: use margin instead http://jsfiddle.net/Ha9aT/2/
[08:34:55] <hendedav> termite, mikecmpbll, aristata can any of you see a resolution to the problem i have referenced several times above?
[08:35:29] <hendedav> it's probably something minor, I just can't figure it out
[08:35:46] <Aristata> hendedav: Sorry mate I cleared my window, can you type it out again?
[08:36:13] <hendedav> np, a demo can be seen at http://staging.cliquesoft.org/test/.  Just click the "Whatever title" bar to see the issue
[08:36:16] <mikecmpbll> i got your page thing up
[08:36:27] <mikecmpbll> the tabs disappear?
[08:36:40] <hendedav> yeah, the bottom div that grows shouldn't disappear
[08:37:00] <hendedav> I tried adding the "display:block" to stop it from doing that, but it isn't working...
[08:37:48] <termite> divContents is inside the part that disapears
[08:37:58] <termite> take it out and you should be fine
[08:38:34] <HughAJWood> hendedav: sisplay:none is being set by jquery
[08:38:42] <HughAJWood> termite: it isn't its below it
[08:38:46] <hendedav> thanks termite, but take it out of what?
[08:39:08] <termite> yeah Hugh is right I misread the dom
[08:39:31] <hendedav> hughajwood, I know that jquery is setting that, that's why I tried to set it manually by adding it to the animate() jquery call
[08:39:44] <HughAJWood> its for some reason making what is below display none also, looks like a definite bug one second
[08:40:05] <hendedav> ok, thanks
[08:40:16] <HughAJWood> http://jsfiddle.net/StWSf/
[08:40:19] <HughAJWood> thats almost working
[08:40:31] <HughAJWood> it's not vanishing anymore but it isn't springing up either
[08:42:18] <diverdude> would it be a good idea to put this into a closure? http://jsfiddle.net/DsJCD/9/   (the block i have encapsulated in the ////////////// )
[08:42:58] <hendedav> hughajwood: someone suggested using a trailing .stop(), but that prevented the bottom div from animation.  Can this be added somehow to resolve the problem?
[08:44:54] <HughAJWood> probably not no
[08:46:42] <hendedav> ok, I've been stumped with this over the last several days... I'm surprised I still have hair :)
[08:48:17] <HughAJWood> http://jsfiddle.net/StWSf/1/
[08:48:20] <HughAJWood> There you go
[08:48:37] <HughAJWood> Instead of toggle have it as a fixed value and it works
[08:49:39] <HughAJWood> toggle was what was making it vanish
[08:49:57] <hendedav> I see, now how can I make it shrink again?
[08:50:05] <hendedav> that's why I was just toggle
[08:50:07] <hendedav> :)
[08:50:28] <hendedav> *using toggle
[08:50:30] <HughAJWood> yeahp, but now we know we can't use toggle :(
[08:50:53] <hendedav> how unfortunate... :(
[08:51:27] <hendedav> would that be a bug in toggle?
[08:52:03] <Mateo_> Found a solution, will use php :)
[08:52:05] <hendedav> maybe we can tackle this from a different way.  Would there be a way to size the bottom based on the height of the top div?
[08:52:07] <Mateo_> Thanks for your help
[08:52:59] <HughAJWood> almost got it hendedav
[08:55:47] <hendedav> thanks for all your help hugh :)
[08:56:52] <HughAJWood> http://jsfiddle.net/StWSf/2/
[08:56:58] <HughAJWood> bit ugly
[08:57:08] <HughAJWood> but it can be simplified
[08:58:03] <Germanaz0> Im getting error, with canvas on IE, rendering an image using drawImage function it throws me INDEX_SIZE_ERR
[08:59:10] <hendedav> hughajwood: thanks, give me a sec to implement in the live version....
[09:02:19] <Germanaz0> need help with canvas and IE 9
[09:02:26] <Germanaz0> someone good at that ?>
[09:03:01] <hendedav> hughajwood: that works good enough for me!!!  Thanks again for your help!!!
[09:03:13] <HughAJWood> hendedav: the issue is that it seems toggle is inverting the display of the object, and you can't set it as true
[09:03:15] <HughAJWood> np
[09:03:36] <hendedav> is this a bug do you think?
[09:03:45] <hendedav> since it's being specified directly?
[09:04:01] <HughAJWood> no I think it is the design of .toggle()
[09:04:08] <hendedav> ah, gotcha
[09:04:26] <hendedav> ok, well at any rate I have a workable solution.  Thanks again and take care. :)
[09:04:32] <HughAJWood> np
[09:10:49] <i8ramin> Hey everyone. Was wondering what dev's should do with the whole elem.outerWidth({margin: true}) and jQuery 1.8
[09:11:04] <i8ramin> it seems that even the jQuery UI codebase does that
[09:11:25] <i8ramin> and it doesn't work as expected in 1.8 .. returns an object instead of a number
[09:23:06] <VarunBatra> Hey people I have this new plugin I am creating http://jsfiddle.net/4a6P4/1/ problem is very simple every other action creates new instance and doesn't properly works. For instance stop should clear current timeout but it isn't although it is going there. CURRENT is always undefiend. I was hoping if you can assist me
[09:24:53] <diverdude> does jquery has a cross browser compatible solution for $(document).focus(function(){...}) ? (this only works in FF)
[09:25:34] <VarunBatra> @diverdude can you rather use bind('focus') or on?
[09:25:56] <diverdude> VarunBatra: that seems to give same result
[09:26:09] <VarunBatra> On as well?
[09:26:16] <diverdude> VarunBatra: yeah
[09:27:07] <VarunBatra> Are your codes in $(document).ready(function($) {?
[09:27:19] <diverdude> VarunBatra: yes
[09:27:19] <HughAJWood> i8ramin: you mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/P3uZJ/1/
[09:27:50] <VarunBatra> jsfiddle it please
[09:29:01] <VarunBatra> HughAJWood that problem also seems to be interesting http://jsfiddle.net/P3uZJ/1/
[09:29:32] <VarunBatra> It should stop/restart but it doesn't clear current timer.
[09:29:34] <i8ramin> HughAJWood, yes. thats the problem
[09:30:03] <diverdude> VarunBatra: http://jsfiddle.net/SzmFF/3/
[09:30:23] <HughAJWood> i8ramin: I see it returns the whole element div#bar
[09:30:24] <i8ramin> HughAJWood, the real issue is that many older versions of jQuery UI and a bunch of plugins are still using the "outerWidth({margin: true})" syntax .. and its causing all kinds of problems
[09:30:43] <i8ramin> yeah, i guess outerWidth({margin: true}) was never the correct way of doing it .. should have been true or false
[09:30:53] <i8ramin> but so many people have been using that syntax (even jQuery UI!)
[09:31:07] <i8ramin> so an upgrade path to 1.8 is very difficult at this point
[09:31:18] <i8ramin> i work for a major internet company .. and we're looking to upgrade to 1.8
[09:31:21] <i8ramin> and this is stopping us
[09:31:44] <ajpiano> i8ramin: there was a version of jquery ui released that is compatible with jquery 1.8
[09:31:50] <ajpiano> please upgrade both libraries
[09:31:59] <i8ramin> ajpiano, understood .. but upgrading jquery itself is already a huge feat for a large company
[09:32:05] <i8ramin> upgrading both is not easy
[09:32:17] <ajpiano> this is a known issue and that is the resolution.
[09:32:20] <Zzaichik> page at a time, buddy.
[09:32:31] <diverdude> VarunBatra: any ideas?
[09:32:31] <i8ramin> well, then i can tell you that adoption to 1.8+ is gonna be VERY slow
[09:32:53] <i8ramin> i don't really understand the need to have outerWidth and outerHeight be setters as well
[09:33:21] <VarunBatra> nope
[09:33:26] <VarunBatra> tried body
[09:33:34] <i8ramin> seems like, given that this was a known issue.. the code could've been written a in a way to handle the situation
[09:33:48] <diverdude> VarunBatra: ?
[09:34:06] <VarunBatra> usually window and body works rather than document.
[09:34:36] <diverdude> VarunBatra: http://jsfiddle.net/SzmFF/6/ no go :/
[09:35:51] <VarunBatra> http://jsfiddle.net/U5x5V/2/
[09:35:58] <VarunBatra> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/U5x5V/2/ this worked
[09:36:21] <i8ramin> ajpiano + HughAJWood  â€¦ FYI, the jQuery Tools project's Overlay code also breaks with that change. Also a very popular project.
[09:36:25] <HughAJWood> i8ramin: I think what would need to happen for you is to build a solution to automatically upgrade and test the code and do both at the same time man, you don't have a choice really now it's released and you don't want to start monkey patching it
[09:37:05] <ajpiano> i8ramin: occasionally we have to make a change in jquery that is incompatible with other libraries that have duck-punched jquery methods
[09:37:17] <HughAJWood> i8ramin: although a monkey patch for that would be quite simple..
[09:37:25] <i8ramin> even when one of those libraries is jquery's own jquery UI?
[09:37:45] <ajpiano> yes, the solution was a point release of jquery ui
[09:37:47] <ajpiano> that solved that issue
[09:37:48] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12232
[09:37:51] <i8ramin> i understand if it was a 3rd party library .. but this seems like it was such an obvious issue
[09:38:31] <VarunBatra> Who is going to see my problem :(
[09:38:44] <i8ramin> rolling out a release is easy .. adopting that release is not.
[09:39:12] <VarunBatra> i8ramin thats a wise wording
[09:40:18] <VarunBatra> I just tweeted that ;)
[09:40:24] <HughAJWood> i8ramin: there's two ways of doing this, being ugly and putting it off by identifying the offending functions and patching or.. by creating a upgrade plan, with automated testing (My preferred)
[09:41:58] <ndee> is there a way to "watch" a <select> and if the select EVER has the value foobar, trigger an event?
[09:42:17] <ndee> and I don't mean the event "change"
[09:45:18] <HughAJWood> ndee: how does the select get the value if it isn't change then?
[09:45:57] <ndee> HughAJWood, it could be through a page reload where the value of the select is determined through serverside code.
[09:47:00] <HughAJWood> ndee: then you could check on document ready and then on change too no?
[09:47:18] <ndee> HughAJWood, true, haha
[09:47:39] <ndee> sometimes... I can't see you because of the trees? (get it ;))
[09:47:47] <ndee> s/?/!
[09:48:13] <ndee> and it would be Forest, not Wood, sorry, it's been a long day.
[09:50:40] <nisseni> how can I set a function if an event is either clicked or changed, do I have to make two functions or can I just make one with an "or" statement?
[09:56:04] <raj> nisseni, what do you mean an event is clicked?
[09:56:41] <nisseni> raj: nvm
[09:56:56] <nisseni> well, what I mean is I have an element, so I want to trigger an event on both click and change
[09:58:31] <NoiseEee> nisseni: they are two different assignments.
[09:58:37] <nisseni> NoiseEee: ok
[10:40:16] <leotr> topic of channel needs to be changed
[10:40:25] <leotr> 1.8.2 is out
[10:42:11] <dukedave> When I call a method on a selector which returns multiple elements, is there any rule guiding what order the method will be evaluated?
[10:42:21] <ajpiano> thanks leotr
[10:42:31] <leotr> ajpiano, ;)
[10:43:05] <dukedave> Context:       $('.please-focus-me, #q, [tabindex="0"]').focus();
[10:44:10] <dukedave> I'd like to apply some ordering there ^
[10:44:23] <leotr> hi! i need to get dimensions and offset (relatively to document) of images, so i can cover them with semi-transparent absolutely positioned blocks. I have no control over the page, i only inject javascript, load jQuery in noConflict mode. Can jQuery be helpful here?
[10:45:28] <leotr> currently everything is fine in Chrome, FF, Opera, but i have problems in IE :(
[10:46:16] <leotr> i suspect that it happens because image coordinates and dimensions are calculated incorrectly
[10:49:58] <Escherial> hey, anyone have a recommendation for an absolutely barebones modal popup plugin? all i want it to do is handle displaying a div that i tell it to and dismissing the div when you click the background (or a close button that's already in the div iteslf)
[10:51:16] <KJ6BVS> so there i am, development is going just fine. then i decide to test in another browser other than chrome
[10:51:40] <KJ6BVS> firefox, IE, android browser... none of them work
[10:52:11] <KJ6BVS> a call to $.ajax is executing its error callback on those browsers, yet not chrome
[10:52:27] <MistuhKurtz> KJ6BVS, you're not doing something cross-domain are you?
[10:52:33] <KJ6BVS> nope
[10:52:46] <KJ6BVS> and the json validates in jsonlint
[10:52:50] <KJ6BVS> im so baffled
[10:53:03] <KJ6BVS> firebug turns up 0 errors
[10:54:20] <KJ6BVS> everything works as expected in chrome, yet somehow not the other browsers
[10:54:28] <Bonnie> hi, had a question about how to get the text within a HTMLParagraph element
[10:54:31] <KJ6BVS> any ideas how i can tackle this problem?
[10:55:20] <Bonnie> when I run $(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0) I get  <p class="left">Total cost</p>; however I want to get only the string "Total Cost"
[10:55:39] <Bonnie> pls can someone help me do that?
[10:55:45] <MistuhKurtz> KJ6BVS, if you can isolate the problem and show it to me i'd be happy to take a look
[10:56:28] <MistuhKurtz> KJ6BVS, are you using parseJSON? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:57:05] <KJ6BVS> i dont actually know. what does jquery use to parse json responses when $.ajax()'s dataType is set to 'json'?
[10:57:26] <KJ6BVS> i imagine that it does use that, but i dont know
[10:58:31] <MistuhKurtz> I imagine that it would do it internally as wello
[10:58:50] <KJ6BVS> ajax generates this error: "SyntaxError: JSON.parse"
[10:59:08] <leotr> Escherial, fancybox?
[10:59:32] <KJ6BVS> i dont see how there could be a syntax error when the json checks out in a validator though?
[10:59:36] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ KJ6BVS
[10:59:40] <KJ6BVS> hm...
[10:59:47] <KJ6BVS> lets see if i can throw one together
[11:00:18] <leotr> Escherial, it can display <div> or even load div by ajax request. I used that.
[11:02:35] <Bonnie>  when I run $(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0) I get  <p class="left">Total cost</p>; however I want to get only the string "Total Cost" - any suggestions on how to do this?
[11:08:41] <pnoexz> Bonnie: add .text() after the .get(0)
[11:08:50] <pnoexz> $(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0).text()
[11:11:26] <Escherial> leotr: ah, neat; i'll take a look at it :)
[11:12:26] <KJ6BVS> ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿var json = ï»¿'ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿{}';  var obj = JSON.parse( json );  // this gives "SyntaxError: Unexpected token"
[11:12:37] <KJ6BVS> i dont see anything wrong with that O.o
[11:12:56] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think an empty object is valid JSON KJ6BVS
[11:13:05] <pnoexz> should be
[11:13:12] <KJ6BVS> validates in jsonlint
[11:13:15] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[11:13:37] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[11:13:38] <MistuhKurtz> don't you need
[11:13:39] <KJ6BVS> alternatively, JSON.parse( '{}' ); works wth
[11:13:42] <pnoexz> fyi, you are not using jquery there
[11:13:49] <KJ6BVS> oh
[11:13:49] <MistuhKurtz> $.parseJSON(data});
[11:14:19] <navaismo> Hi all, I have a question: Why when I apply a button style to an anchor it doesnt work anymore? http://pastebin.com/PYJ54a1A
[11:14:34] <navaismo> If I remove the style and leaves as simple a href it works
[11:15:08] <KJ6BVS> well im just using what jquery's using for $.ajax
[11:15:17] <KJ6BVS> im getting an error message that says JSON.parse is failing
[11:15:33] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: yes, but you are not using jquery to parse the json
[11:15:49] <MistuhKurtz> idk what "JSON.parse" is
[11:15:53] <pnoexz> try $.parseJSON(object) instead
[11:15:56] <MistuhKurtz> sounds like it might be a part of the json2 library
[11:16:15] <pnoexz> JSON.parse() is part of the json2 lib indeed
[11:16:27] <KJ6BVS> well it's not my fault jquery is using JSON.parse
[11:16:32] <KJ6BVS> i dont know what it is either :S
[11:16:43] <pnoexz> jquery is not using JSON.parse
[11:16:45] <pnoexz> YOU are
[11:16:51] <KJ6BVS> no im not
[11:17:01] <KJ6BVS> $.ajax() is using it to automatically parse my json response
[11:17:09] <pnoexz> it doesnt
[11:17:16] <pnoexz> i just had the same issue
[11:17:33] <Bonnie> pnoexz, have tried $(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0).text() - error saying HTMLParagraphElement does not have text function, have tried text as a property, not a function, no luck
[11:18:15] <pnoexz> Bonnie: tried html()? maybe the get(0) is returning something other than a jquery object
[11:18:18] <KJ6BVS> so how do i get it to stop using JSON.parse?
[11:18:37] <pnoexz> so do an alert(typeof $(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0)) just to check
[11:19:00] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: why are you using get(0) ?
[11:19:19] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: are you sure it is using JSON.parse()? do an alert(typeof object)) to check
[11:19:23] <Bonnie> pnoexz, have tried html(), val() - none have worked - the object is a HTMLparagraphElement
[11:19:25] <pnoexz> if it says "string" then its not being parsed
[11:20:01] <pnoexz> Bonnie: oh, so its returning a dom object instead.. use .innerText
[11:20:03] <Bonnie> NoiseEee, using get(0) since this returns asn array of 4 elements
[11:20:05] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: because by using get(0) you are selecting the actual DOM element and not a jquery object
[11:20:11] <pnoexz> no wait
[11:20:24] <KJ6BVS> it's not finishing the parsing step. the error that i get from $.ajax() is: "SyntaxError: JSON.parse"
[11:20:31] <pnoexz> Bonnie: i believe its .textContent
[11:20:34] <pnoexz> cant remember
[11:20:39] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: but you're selecting 4 classes?  change your selector?!
[11:20:58] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: show the code please
[11:21:37] <KJ6BVS> http://pastebin.com/zeesAwJB
[11:22:10] <Bonnie> NoiseEee, this element has 4 classes, in my JS code I am using child selectors, the one i pasted here if from the console
[11:22:26] <pnoexz> Bonnie: another workaround is making jquery parse the resulting element, giving you a jquery object., meaning you can .text() it
[11:22:40] <KJ6BVS> which results in my content being set to: "Error Status: parsererror<br />Error Text: SyntaxError: JSON.parse"
[11:23:00] <pnoexz> Bonnie:  $($(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0)).text() should work..
[11:23:15] <pnoexz> but like i said, its a workaround
[11:23:18] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: change "get(0)" to "first()"
[11:23:28] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: understand the massive difference
[11:23:28] <Bonnie> pnoexz, will try innerText and contentText, will also try $($(".gp-top .gp-left .gp-left-title .left").get(0)).text()
[11:23:30] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: pastebin is down for me
[11:24:06] <Bonnie> yes, can see that now that you have pointed it out
[11:24:22] <pnoexz> Bonnie: even if it works, i do suggest you to look into NoiseEee's suggestion, you should understand why get() does what it does and the difference if you use first()
[11:24:47] <KJ6BVS> http://codepaste.net/trhn1m
[11:25:18] <NoiseEee> KJ6BVS: you'll have to paste your loadDataSuccess() function as well
[11:25:18] <David_Bradbury> Are there any resources out there that have pre-made additional effects that you can use as alternatives to the built in effects like fadeIn/Out and slideIn/Out?
[11:25:32] <cad> Why it's impossible to disable a f.cking button with jquery programatically?
[11:25:37] <Bonnie> in my actual code I have this or part of it within a $each loop, so I don't have a selector with 4 classes in my code
[11:25:40] <KJ6BVS> why? it never gets called because the error callback is being executed instead
[11:25:53] <NoiseEee> cad: the obvious answer is that "you're doing it wrong"
[11:26:17] <cad> NoiseEee: i am reading over this for at least 2 hours
[11:26:21] <NoiseEee> KJ6BVS: so you're expecting xml from an error response and json from a successful one?
[11:26:28] <David_Bradbury> wat
[11:26:43] <KJ6BVS> huh?
[11:26:53] <David_Bradbury> I don't know, someone's mad
[11:26:55] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: the first parameter in your error function
[11:27:07] <KJ6BVS> oh thats just copy-paste
[11:27:17] <cad> NoiseEee: it's possible to disable it when i provide disabled attribute in the html but it's impossible to disable it via javascript
[11:27:18] <KJ6BVS> im not expecting xml
[11:27:30] <citric2> cad: it's actually quite easy
[11:27:35] <NoiseEee> KJ6BVS: if you're getting the error callback fired, its because the server is sending an error response
[11:27:41] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: have you tried removing the "dataType: 'json'" and handle it as json yourself?
[11:27:46] <NoiseEee> cad: well jsfiddle what you've been trying
[11:27:57] <Bonnie> will try first() to get a JQuery object instead of the DOM object
[11:28:00] <KJ6BVS> hm... no. i'll try that
[11:28:13] <David_Bradbury> cad: Would you like to ask a question instead of coming in here and being angry? Because what you're trying to do is pretty easy.
[11:28:48] <pnoexz> Bonnie: thats what i would do as well
[11:29:11] <MistuhKurtz> cad, $("input").prop('disabled', true);
[11:30:42] <David_Bradbury> MistuhKurtz: You realize that by helping him, you're encouraging him to come here and act like an 8 year-old every time he has an issue he can't solve, yes? :)
[11:31:33] <MistuhKurtz> cad don't act like an 8 year old
[11:31:39] <MistuhKurtz> There we go David_Bradbury :P
[11:32:01] <David_Bradbury> Magic!
[11:32:03] <KJ6BVS> hm... this is odd. it works in IE now. i get an error in jquery-1.8.0.js on line 514
[11:32:15] <KJ6BVS> which is where $.parseJSON uses JSON.parse to parse the object
[11:32:37] <KJ6BVS> the error being from firefox, that is
[11:33:05] <pnoexz> if it only works in ie, it doesnt work at all
[11:33:21] <KJ6BVS> works in chrome too
[11:33:44] <MistuhKurtz> what's the error KJ6BVS
[11:34:49] <KJ6BVS> it just says "Error: JSON.parse" really helpful -.-
[11:37:11] <daterr> if the value in a selector e.g. $("input[id=search_keyword]").val() has a single quote.. it's giving the error "syntax error, unrecognized expression".. if the selector value does not contain a single quote then there is no error and works fine.. using 1.8.1.. even if I escape() it it still gives the same error.. any ideas?
[11:37:58] <catcher> I'm writing a click-driven vertical image scroller that stops on either end when it should.  The problem I get is when I click very quickly, it seems the values come back incorrectly, allowing scrolling to happen when it shouldn't.
[11:38:46] <catcher> how can I force it to wait until the previous animation is complete?
[11:39:09] <catcher> tried .stop(), that seems to just kill the animation altogether.
[11:39:14] <cad> citric2: http://jsfiddle.net/S2PRP/11/
[11:39:57] <artichoke> I'm doing a $.ajax POST to set a value in the database which then returns a JSON object.  It works fine the first time I execute the call, but subsequent calls don't affect the DB yet the same response is returned.  I have cache: false but that doesn't seem to help.. any clues? The POST URL and the query parameters are currently the same for each request I make.
[11:40:08] <cad> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/S2PRP/12/
[11:42:13] <KJ6BVS> WOW
[11:42:15] <KJ6BVS> wth man
[11:42:20] <KJ6BVS> firefox just finished updating
[11:42:23] <KJ6BVS> and boom it works
[11:42:23] <NoiseEee> cad...
[11:42:51] <KJ6BVS> it must have been a specific problem with the version of firefox i had
[11:43:01] <NoiseEee> cad: it helps to actually refer to the element's real ID
[11:43:02] <KJ6BVS> so much for the last hour of wasted time :(
[11:43:42] <KJ6BVS> thanks for trying to help me MistuhKurtz, pnoexz, and NoiseEee
[11:43:55] <NoiseEee> np good luck KJ6BVS
[11:43:56] <KJ6BVS> i really appreciate when i can just come on here and fire away a question like that
[11:44:12] <pnoexz> KJ6BVS: no problem, sorry i couldnt help more
[11:44:44] <KJ6BVS> dont be sorry. it's mostly my fault for not keeping my dev environment up-to-date
[11:44:49] <cad> NoiseEee: here is what i'm gonna do. I am gonna go jump through the window
[11:44:57] <KJ6BVS> lesson learned, i guess
[11:45:59] <KJ6BVS> wow... i was on a reaaaally old version
[11:46:04] <KJ6BVS> i hadn't used firefox in a long time
[11:46:15] <KJ6BVS> i had 3.6.x
[11:46:29] <KJ6BVS> current version is 12 X.x
[11:47:27] <NoiseEee> lol
[11:47:29] <NoiseEee> :)
[11:47:47] <termite> M0mb4s4
[11:51:16] <agrieser> Hey all, I asked yesterday about an issue with "ajaxStop" events not firing for some ajax requests. I have been debugging this, and the difference between a request that fires the ajaxstop event, and a request that doesn't is whether the event is found in jQuery.cache in the jQuery.event.trigger method. Any ideas on where to go from here? [lines 2894-2900 in jQuery 1.8.2]
[11:51:44] <agrieser> The problem is also present in jQuery 1.8.1
[11:53:16] <wingy> jquery mobile is the best thing since sliced bread
[11:56:31] <termite> agrieser: I believe ajaxStop only fires when all requests are done.  So if you make 3 calls then it will not fire till all three are done.
[11:57:02] <Bonnie> thx , pnoexz, NoiseEee - first and text() worked and i understand a lot more now
[11:57:03] <agrieser> termite: Right, that is what I am checking. The problem is that it never fires at all.
[11:57:14] <NoiseEee> Bonnie: np good luck
[11:57:25] <pnoexz> Bonnie: no problem
[11:57:35] <agrieser> termite: ajaxstart fires, and ajaxstop never fires. There is only one request going on.
[11:57:58] <termite> agrieser: do you have a fiddle we can look at because my guess is that it's a bind issue
[11:59:04] <agrieser> termite: I haven't been able to reproduce in jsfiddle unfortunately. Only in the app I'm working on. But it is reproducible in the app every time.
[12:00:27] <agrieser> termite: One particular ajax request is causing this. After this ajax request starts, even calling 'jQuery.event.trigger("ajaxStop")' does not fire the handler.
[12:00:27] <termite> agrieser: I would make sure that your not unbinding or remove objects from the DOM
[12:01:27] <termite> agrieser: open up dev tools in your browser and see if the request timesout
[12:01:43] <agrieser> termite: No, it returns with a 200
[12:02:08] <agrieser> In fact, the app continues to work correctly. All data is set as expected. It is just that the ajaxstop handler never fires
[12:02:54] <agrieser> also, note that explicitly triggering the event via jQuery.event.trigger will not fire the handler after this request starts.
[12:04:16] <termite> agrieser: is the page publicly available?
[12:05:57] <CreazioN> Can I get the blue to move with the red, until the red is gone from the screen, then fixed top: 0
[12:06:21] <CreazioN> and when red come back, blue should connect -> http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/VzStS/
[12:07:09] <agrieser> termite: No, unfortunately the page is not public. I can try to get you set up with an account if you think you can debug it.
[12:08:09] <Croves> Hi guys!
[12:09:34] <WBGate> Hey everyone, i have a little question about jquery. Is it possible to make a div draggable, only between one div and one other ?  ? ? here is a link with my sample
[12:09:35] <WBGate> http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/snujqqhc/0
[12:09:50] <Croves> I have a <div id="father_01010a">, but the string after "father_" is generated randomically
[12:10:04] <someprimetime> what's the difference between these two: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/Bz5n9/28/
[12:10:17] <Croves> I need to do is: When the user click this div, another div will open, and this div have the id="child_01010a">
[12:11:24] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you around?
[12:17:17] <malorie> can somebody recommend me a sorting plugin?
[12:19:02] <phiz> i am using .load() to replace some data in a <div></div> with some html that contains a button, but i have a click event handler that doesn't seem to work with it.  any ideas?
[12:19:29] <ravenzz> ?on @ phiz
[12:19:30] <bot-t> phiz, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:19:59] <phiz> i saw that .on replaced delegate which is deprecated, i couldn't seem to wrap my brain around using it though
[12:20:25] <phiz> i was trying just $("button").on("click", function(event) { alert("test"); })
[12:20:46] <ravenzz> well parent.on('click', 'button', function () { })
[12:21:11] <ravenzz> if you don't provide a selector ('button') it will bind on "parent"
[12:21:14] <ravenzz> that's all
[12:21:55] <termite> someprimetime:  don't the have to pass DOM objects to pushstack
[12:22:09] <phiz> ravenzz: ahh, i'll give that a whirl, thanks for clarifying
[12:22:18] <someprimetime> termite: not sure what that means
[12:23:18] <termite> someprimetime: are you trying to append all the li elements to $li1
[12:23:44] <termite> someprimetime: or clones of them
[12:24:07] <quorum> hi
[12:24:14] <phiz> ravenzz: cool, that saved me a week of scratching my head i'm sure.  thanks again.
[12:24:21] <someprimetime> append them all
[12:24:26] <someprimetime> it looks like they do the exact same thing
[12:24:29] <ravenzz> ah I am glad to hear that, yw
[12:26:10] <artichoke> My $.ajax POST seems to be returning a cached response on subsequent calls which doesn't actually hit the server.. any clues on how to fix it?
[12:26:58] <ScottG> Is there a more elegant way of writing this? $('.foo select, .foo input')
[12:27:17] <termite> {cache:false} in the ajax options
[12:27:18] <ScottG> I basically want to elimate the duplicate .foo
[12:28:13] <termite> jquery selector
[12:28:21] <artichoke> termite: yeah I tried cache: false but that isn't doing anything
[12:28:49] <termite> artichoke: IE? try adding a timestamp to the send of the url
[12:29:46] <termite> artichoke: ?ts="+ new Date().getTime();
[12:29:55] <artichoke> termite: the request is being made on an ios app wrapped in phonegap
[12:30:06] <artichoke> termite: i'll try that though, thanks
[12:35:14] <artichoke> termite: yeah the timestamp fixed it, thanks
[12:35:39] <termite> np that drove me nuts when I ran into the first time
[12:35:52] <termite> good old i.e. 5.5
[12:36:43] <artichoke> yeah I was using the poster addon for firefox to test it and it worked fine everytime, but it would only work for the first request on the mobile app
[12:38:32] <quorum> does $().load ignore $.ajaxSetup() ?
[12:44:09] <bjensen> when I do var area_contents = $("#my_cool_text_area").val(); $.get("/users/preview?contents=" + area_contents); but the problem is that the new lines are stripped that are within the text area, how can I make sure they are sent using the ajax requst?
[12:48:31] <Escherial> bjensen: are you sure that it's not taking your newlines? newlines don't render in html
[12:48:40] <Escherial> you have to explicitly convert them to <br/>s
[12:48:45] <Escherial> or use a <pre> tag
[12:49:09] <bjensen> Escherial: I can see what is sent to the server: "letter_body"=>"dfdffdsfdsf12345", the numbers are on different lines
[12:49:19] <bjensen> sorry received on the server
[12:50:04] <Escherial> hmm, you're also feeding it in as a GET variable, which might be stripping the newlines
[12:50:11] <Escherial> what if you were to include it as POST data?
[12:50:39] <Escherial> if you alert() area_contents, it should show it with newlines
[12:50:46] <Escherial> er, alert(area_contents), of course
[12:51:45] <scr3am> try $t = explode(chr(13), sent_stuff) -> var_dump($t) to see if...
[12:52:02] <NoiseEee> bjensen: unable to replicate your problem. http://jsfiddle.net/HSwdk/
[12:52:18] <NoiseEee> bjensen: slash debug on the backend
[12:53:32] <bjensen> hmm
[12:55:01] <bjensen> its not because I have to escape stuff when I try to send it ?
[12:57:03] <bjensen> Here is when I even tried to make it even more simple: http://pastie.org/4775344
[13:07:54] <bjensen> Escherial: you are right if I use post then it works. I can see the newlines being transmitted
[13:09:04] <bjensen> the problem was that I used window.open(url)
[13:12:19] <phiz> what would the proper way to display a "loading..." message in a <div id="displaythis">...</div>?  I tried $("#displaythis").replaceWith('loading...'); $("#displaythis").load("test.html");
[13:12:52] <phiz> doesn't seem to make it to that .load
[13:13:12] <Escherial> bjensen: ah, glad you figured it out :)
[13:13:22] <bjensen> Escherial: well I'm not quite there yet :-/
[13:13:25] <Escherial> (sorry for being unresponsive, a bit busy)
[13:13:29] <bjensen> sure thing mate
[13:13:40] <Escherial> you're at least getting your newlines, so you're a step closer :)
[13:13:54] <Escherial> you could encode them as <br>s before transmission if you're just displaying them, perhaps
[13:14:09] <termite> $("#displaythis").text('loading...');
[13:14:13] <bjensen> I would like to make a link that when you click on it, jquery adds the contents of the texture to the query string and I would do a window.open on it. that doesn't work though..
[13:14:51] <bjensen> If I choose to use $.ajax then when the pdf document is returned, the browser isn't picking it up as an atachment
[13:14:52] <termite> phiz:$("#displaythis").text('loading...');
[13:16:36] <phiz> termite: the element is getting updated w/ loading... it just isn't getting updated w/ the content of the load
[13:18:12] <phiz> i am actually trying this: $(this).closest('tr').replaceWith('<tr><td colspan="2">loading...</td></tr>'); $(this).closest('tr').load("ajax.php?HostID="+buttoncommoneventid+"&ShowDistinctCommonEvents=1"); with the second returning <td>test</td><td>test</td>
[13:19:05] <phiz> i wrote the $(this).closest('tr').attr('class') w/ console.log to make sure it was finding the right tr
[13:21:26] <phiz> if i take out that first loading statement it works fine too.
[13:24:01] <phiz> is that another delegation issue maybe?
[13:29:43] <bjensen> when I submit a form and I intercept it using $(document).on("submit", "form", {}), how can I add for example a field ?
[13:29:53] <bjensen> well basically its the field data I'm interested in
[13:30:39] <bjensen> Im making a preview function so I want to when users submit the form, then I need to get the current val() of an textarea and then insert it into the form
[13:31:20] <buzzedword> hey guys, just a heads up-- i'm making a "bower hitlist" for plugins that aren't yet available through bower-- if you have any you'd like to see hit it up here: https://gist.github.com/3763537
[13:31:47] <buzzedword> i've been working with a few guys today on making their stuff available on bower, and helping set up component.json + github setups
[13:33:58] <buzzedword> i'm starting with bower since it's the fastest to implement, but if this picks up enough traction, i'm open to helping add support for other package management systems. just a start! :)
[14:06:33] <barraponto> how do i unwrap a jquery object
[14:06:47] <barraponto> actually, it's an array of strings, wrapped as a jQuery object
[14:07:02] <barraponto> (from a $(selection).map() call )
[14:07:34] <barraponto> i expected .get() or .toArray() to return me an array
[14:07:48] <barraponto> but typeof keeps telling me it's still an object
[14:07:57] <barraponto> and i can't call array.reduce :/
[14:12:37] <bartmax> If I have 3 radio inputs, when you click it calls an ajax that take some time so <p> shows : loading... and i want to end the dialog when it ends, but you can change radio when the async is ocurring and i want to clear the loading only when the last ajax is complete. is Deferred the object am I looking for ?
[14:13:38] <barraponto> nevermind, arrays are objects.
[14:47:23] <MichMich_> Hey guys!
[14:47:47] <sebfz1> Hi all !
[14:48:20] <sebfz1> Question about DatePicker: is there a way to select a range inside the widget ?
[14:49:03] <MichMich_> I'm trying to fill my developers database with nice libraries, frameworks, etc... any suggestions? http://devcandy.net
[14:50:34] <sebfz1> MichMich: nice site ! :)
[14:50:48] <Lucky--> which theme is that
[14:51:41] <Lucky--> i know this is stupid but uh jquery?
[14:51:47] <Lucky--> jquery mobile as well
[15:05:56] <MichMich_> Lucky--: sorry for the slow reply... was busy filling my site :P
[15:06:15] <MichMich_> jquery, bootstrap, laravel, sass...

[15:11:12] <David_Bradbury> http://www.bootscrap.org ;)
[15:11:14] <David_Bradbury> gah
[15:15:04] <rgr> goddam checkboxes..
[15:16:03] <blindMoe> it is interesting that bootstrap was created by some guys from twitter yet twitter doesn't use it
[15:17:18] <johnkpaul> blindMoe: I believe that twitter does use it
[15:17:22] <johnkpaul> just not for everything
[15:17:31] <blindMoe> yeah they don't use it on their homepage
[15:17:35] <blindMoe> maybe interior pages
[15:17:44] <johnkpaul> and internal apps
[15:18:56] <sebfz1> Nobody on my question about the DatePicker? (a way to select a date range inside the widget...)
[15:19:09] <blindMoe> sebfz1: depends on what date picker you are using
[15:19:20] <blindMoe> if you are using jquery-ui then there is an example on their demo page
[15:20:14] <sebfz1> blindMoe, thanks. Yes, the jquery ui one. I know about the demo but it is 2 datepicker, one for the start, one for the end
[15:20:42] <sebfz1> I would like, with only one datepicker, be able to select the range
[15:21:13] <sebfz1> ie, I click on sep-12 and sep-14, inside the same widget
[15:22:03] <blindMoe> sebfz1: http://www.eyecon.ro/datepicker/
[15:22:06] <blindMoe> that datepicker offers it
[15:23:52] <sebfz1> yep... thanks, I saw it. I I wanted to use the jQuery UI one ! :s
[15:37:10] <dJquery> what am I doing wrong with animate? http://jsbin.com/eneroh/2/edit
[15:37:22] <dJquery> the ball should move when clicking the green square

[15:49:22] <TelFiRE> RunBikeRow: I don't think this.test exists inside your function. I'm a noob though could be totally wrong.
[15:49:32] <dJquery> hmmm it doesnt like it
[15:49:57] <dJquery> your function doesnt return anyting
[15:50:18] <RunBikeRow> how are you testing it?
[15:50:35] <dJquery> http://jsbin.com/oqohun/2/edit
[15:50:45] <dJquery> click on console at the top

[15:54:37] <RunBikeRow> ok I appreciate the help dJquery
[16:34:30] <orion> Hi. When I download jquery UI 1.8.23, I notice that the button example in index.html does not work.
[16:34:44] <orion> All other widgets work (dialog, etc) except for the button.
[16:35:24] <orion> This happens in both Opera 12.02 and Firefox 15.0.1.
[16:36:03] <orion> Does anyone know what could be going wrong?
[16:48:36] <orion> I am on FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE.
[16:49:00] <orion> Also, I just downloaded the example on Windows 7 and Firefox 15.0.1 and it still doesn't work.
[16:56:17] <kwerle> I'm doing a load or a get of a page with a lot of img resources.  I only want to display a small portion of the page, so I specify a selector for load - but all the images on the page are being fetched anyway.  Is there a way to avoid that?
[17:28:47] <defaultro> gnarf, you there?
[20:13:04] <DaSpawn1> I have a strange issue with the animate function, only on 1 OS and browser, Chrome on Ubuntu (not sure if all linux variants), I have a menu that repositions on the page when scrolling, but when close to the bottom of the page, it jumps around erratically, and when scrolling up it jumps way down then animates up, anyone know what would cause it?
[20:19:30] <raj> shoky?
[20:23:51] <sarasota> hello world
[20:35:54] <pat> Noob question :  I create some divs in document ready adn put them there with append - now every div is in one seperate line - what do i need to do that one div is added on the next side of the other one  ? Page: http://134.99.4.82/tb/gui/test.html
[20:37:31] <seich> pat: float them with css?
[20:37:58] <sarasota> .size_big { float:left;}
[20:39:15] <pat> ok thx
[20:40:12] <pat> done
[20:40:17] <pat> muchas gracias :)
[20:40:48] <pat> thats the first step of the gui im building for an webGL game
[20:46:19] <conner_> for some reason, calling $("#my_element").height() is messing up the layout...
[20:47:09] <conner_> is that an issue/known?
[20:49:04] <conner_> hmm, nevermind.  seems to be an absolute positioning issue
[21:16:38] <otac0n> Anyone have a second to help me troubleshoot a $.delegate issue?
[21:16:58] <otac0n> http://jsfiddle.net/ZfS9u/2/
[21:17:21] <otac0n> Why are my .delegate() scroll events not firing, but .bind('scroll') works?
[21:17:36] <otac0n> I would ask this on stack overflow, except it looks to be a bug in jQuery.
[21:17:36] <barraponto> otac0n: can't you use .on?
[21:17:47] <otac0n> I can't, because I'm using Backbone.
[21:18:31] <otac0n> I can actually use .bind() if I have to, but I'd prefer to use Backbone's native eventing.
[21:18:42] <otac0n> (Which uses $.delegate)
[21:19:21] <barraponto> oh, anyway
[21:19:35] <barraponto> afaik, .delegate uses .on in jquery 1.8
[21:20:12] <otac0n> let me try .on, anyways.
[21:21:28] <NetTalk> my uploadify code works perfectly on chrome n firefox but it doesnt work on firefox... and even on firefox 14, it wouldnt show upload button
[21:21:34] <NetTalk> any idea guys?
[21:21:55] <barraponto> otac0n: quirkmode says scroll events don't bubble.
[21:22:02] <barraponto> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/scroll.html
[21:22:51] <otac0n> I guess that makes sense... :/
[21:23:25] <NetTalk> i get an error "i.jpg (504.10KB) - HTTP Error" on the firefox when i try to upload image using uploadify
[21:24:16] <NetTalk> only happens firefox 11, 12 n 13 version.. and on firefox 14 n 15 ... it wouldnt show any uploady button
[21:24:20] <NetTalk> help me guys
[21:24:30] <NetTalk> http://www.uploadify.com/demos/
[21:25:05] <barraponto> otac0n: css4 has a parent selector ( < ), but jquery already has it available as $(selector).parent()
[21:25:18] <barraponto> there's even ancestors...
[21:25:23] <otac0n> I don't follow.
[21:25:49] <otac0n> I'm just going to use $.scroll(), since they don't bubble.
[21:26:51] <barraponto> idk what you're trying to do... but good luck!
[21:28:06] <otac0n> Thanks, I got it working, but not as pretty as I would like.
[22:05:21] <shoky> raj
[22:06:00] <raj> :)
[22:07:24] <shoky> i answered a couple of your questions here
[22:07:35] <shoky> but you always d/c'd or disappeared
[22:07:38] <shoky> no idea if you got m
[22:07:39] <shoky> got em
[22:07:48] <shoky> i mean in the past week, not today
[22:07:59] <raj> if a user has my webpage open and opens a second instance of my webpage in a browser tab, how can I make the server recognize the same session? or at least a linked session?
[22:08:11] <raj> shoky, when I'm at work, it's a really shitty connection
[22:08:17] <shoky> i made you a good solution for that css layout q you asked
[22:08:17] <raj> i'm home now though
[22:08:29] <shoky> pure css
[22:08:49] <GoSox> most sessions are cookie-based so the server shoudl see your session no matter how many browser windows you open
[22:09:03] <shoky> ^^
[22:09:19] <raj> it isn't in sockjs i don't think
[22:09:34] <shoky> you need session handling
[22:09:38] <GoSox> well its either in cookies or with a hash in the URL
[22:09:39] <shoky> do users log in?
[22:09:44] <shoky> hmm
[22:09:48] <raj> if they login it's easy
[22:09:55] <raj> but if they don't, that's what I'm not sure about
[22:10:12] <GoSox> manually set cookies then
[22:10:14] <shoky> well if all else fails.. you can just link the ips
[22:10:18] <shoky> no?
[22:10:19] <GoSox> look for cookies and if none are found, set cookies
[22:10:37] <raj> hmm, k, i'll look into this further then
[22:10:43] <shoky> it depends what do you consider "a session"
[22:11:12] <shoky> and a "linked session"
[22:12:09] <shoky> and why do you want to recognize it
[22:16:53] <wingy> jquery feels like the linux for the web
[22:17:00] <wingy> its OS .. its big
[22:18:39] <abjorn> o.0
[22:18:44] <shoky> O.o
[22:18:52] <GoSox> o.o
[22:21:46] <GoSox> how can i add some code inside an <ul>, at the beginning of it?
[22:21:56] <shoky> ?prepend
[22:21:57] <bot-t> .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[22:22:04] <GoSox> so in other words, I want to add a <li> to the begining of <ul>
[22:22:25] <GoSox> ah oh
[22:22:44] <b1lly> GoSox: $('ul').prepend('<li>SUP</li>');
[22:22:57] <xaxxon> what is the return type of $('input') or something?  it looks like an array.. but I can't call .reduce on it and I'm confused
[22:23:17] <shoky> xaxxon: it's not a real Array
[22:23:36] <shoky> xaxxon: it's a jquery collection (which has some properties of an array)
[22:23:50] <xaxxon> yeah.. I figured that out.. so what the heck is it..  is there a way to nudge it into an array?
[22:23:52] <shoky> xaxxon: you can call .get() on it to get a proper array of DOM nodes
[22:23:57] <xaxxon> perfect
[22:24:23] <shoky> at least i think its proper
[22:24:41] <shoky> ?get
[22:24:41] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:24:45] <shoky> ;s
[22:24:54] <xaxxon> just trying to get a stupid sum of the value of a bunch of range inputs.. it's a PITA
[22:25:04] <shoky> simple
[22:25:07] <shoky> use .map
[22:25:13] <shoky> and then reduce
[22:25:14] <shoky> ;P
[22:25:23] <GoSox> how can I count the number of children in a parent. for example, the number of <li>'s in a <ul>?
[22:25:33] <xaxxon> i was using map, but you have to keep an external variable..
[22:26:20] <xaxxon> was really trying to get it into a single logical line
[22:26:26] <shoky> $('input').map(function(input) { return input.val() }).reduce(function(a,b){ return a+b })
[22:26:28] <shoky> i think
[22:26:55] <xaxxon> is 0 default initial value for reduce?
[22:27:11] <shoky> no,
[22:27:19] <b1lly> GoSox: $('ul li').length
[22:27:23] <shoky> with no initial value it just starts with the first 2 elements
[22:27:29] <xaxxon> oh neat
[22:27:33] <b1lly> or $('ul').children().length
[22:27:35] <GoSox> .length? to count items?
[22:27:54] <xaxxon> @ranges.get().reduce (value,range)=>value + this.get_range_value range
[22:27:58] <shoky> xaxxon: .map there is the jquery .map, .reduce is the ECMA5 or whatever
[22:28:02] <xaxxon> get_range_value is my helper..
[22:28:04] <shoky> because jquery .map returns a proper array
[22:28:08] <xaxxon> right
[22:28:17] <b1lly> GoSox: you can use .length or .size()
[22:28:26] <GoSox> ok
[22:28:28] <xaxxon> ok, thank you very much shoky
[22:28:34] <shoky> np
[22:28:35] <b1lly> http://api.jquery.com/size/
[22:30:20] <shoky> oops xaxxon it should've been  return $(input).val()
[22:30:27] <shoky> eh
[22:30:33] <shoky> or just  return input.value;
[22:30:34] <shoky> ;P
[22:58:29] <raj> shoky, i want to recognize it so when a new browser window is open, it doesn't log a new guest user in
[22:58:39] <GoSox> if i want to hide and item with slideUp(), and then delete it once it's hidden, how do i do that
[22:58:42] <raj> (if the original session is also a guest)
[22:58:49] <GoSox> just tack something like .delete() to the end?
[22:59:04] <GoSox> $("#id").slideUp().delete();
[22:59:07] <raj> or prevent the original session from sending anymore messages if the original session was a logged in user
[22:59:48] <raj> basically sockjs is creating a session id, which is fine, but I need to find a way to associate that with two non-logged in browser pages on the same computer
[23:00:23] <shoky> why, if i may ask ;p
[23:01:23] <shoky> GoSox: .slideUp(function() { $(this).remove() })
[23:02:49] <GoSox> cool
[23:04:56] <raj> shoky, why what?
[23:05:06] <raj> why would someone open two browser pages?
[23:05:26] <raj> or why would I want "expected" functionality?
[23:06:10] <shoky> why would you want a new browser window with no logged in user to care about any other window
[23:06:43] <raj> because otherwise they will automatically be assigned a new random guest username (e.g., Guest3823)
[23:07:02] <shoky> so? they opened a new window
[23:07:13] <shoky> and they're not logged in
[23:07:14] <raj> but they probably want to have two windows open
[23:07:20] <raj> with the same username
[23:07:24] <shoky> no username
[23:07:28] <shoky> they're not logged in..
[23:07:36] <raj> their temporary username is Guest2384
[23:07:51] <shoky> so open a session for them just like you do for a logged in user
[23:07:53] <raj> until they close all tabs to my webpage
[23:08:16] <raj> but how can I do that without a login?
[23:08:27] <shoky> why do you need a login for that
[23:08:34] <shoky> your serverside just needs to open a new session
[23:08:53] <shoky> just like it does after a login
[23:09:12] <raj> I used their authenticated username as the key in an associated array matched with sockjs's session_id as the value
[23:09:37] <shoky> ok so here use Guest3823 instead of an authenticated username
[23:09:38] <raj> so a new browser page would create an additional session_id, which is fine, cuz I'll just create an array for a value to the username key
[23:10:00] <raj> but when they open a new tab with my webpage, they are starting with a clean slate
[23:10:15] <raj> there is no "logged in" session i can catch ahold of
[23:10:26] <shoky> and there is one, when they log-in?
[23:10:41] <shoky> not sure i understand..
[23:11:16] <shoky> you dont have any cookie-based session for loggd-in users?
[23:11:43] <shoky> a regular session like any ol' php or python or whatever would open
[23:12:25] <raj> hmm
[23:12:33] <raj> I do have cookie-based session for logged in users
[23:12:39] <raj> but not for not-logged-in-users
[23:12:43] <shoky> then why not have one for non-logged-in-users?
[23:13:16] <shoky> it's just a session between the browser and the server
[23:13:26] <shoky> it has nothing to do with being "logged in" or not
[23:36:53] <GoSox> how do i reference specific characters of a string in javascript?
[23:39:25] <shoky> GoSox: .charAt  .indexOf  .splice  etc
[23:39:58] <shoky> also
[23:40:07] <shoky> ?eval "abcde"[3]
[23:40:10] <bot-t> shoky: "d"
[23:40:14] <GoSox> .charAt looks good
[23:41:20] <GoSox> so my last question (for now) is, how can i verify that a character is an integer? It's a string I know because it's an input, but how can I make sure that it's 0-9, and not anything else?
[23:41:34] <GoSox> php has an is_numeric() function for situations like this
[23:42:57] <shoky> ?eval [isNan('_'), isNan('7')]
[23:42:58] <bot-t> shoky: ReferenceError: isNan is not defined
[23:43:05] <shoky> ?eval [isNaN('_'), isNaN('7')]
[23:43:06] <bot-t> shoky: [true, false]
[23:44:12] <GoSox> cool
[23:44:25] <GoSox> this should work pretty good to verify if the input is a zip code or not
[23:44:38] <shoky> ?eval /[0-9]/.test('7')
[23:44:39] <bot-t> shoky: true
[23:45:02] <GoSox> although i guess i don't need to break it down char at a time
[23:45:20] <shoky> ?eval /[0-9]{5}/.test('11797')
[23:45:21] <bot-t> shoky: true
[23:45:51] <GoSox> using .length and isNaN( ) should be faster than a regexp though, right?
[23:46:04] <GoSox> though i guess it doesn't matter since it's client side
[23:46:09] <shoky> lol what
[23:46:11] <shoky> that's absurd
[23:46:41] <shoky> it matters much more on the client
[23:46:43] <aro> if i have an on('change') and on('click') for a radio button, how can i make it so only one of those events is fired?
[23:46:48] <GoSox> in php, the non-regexp functions are faster than the regexp function
[23:47:09] <shoky> yes.. non-regex can be faster,
[23:47:18] <shoky> but.. how many zips are you checking
[23:47:49] <shoky> if its less than 100000 you have better things to spend your time on
[23:48:48] <aro> anyone know?
