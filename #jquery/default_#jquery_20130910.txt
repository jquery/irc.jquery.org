[00:06:05] <b0nn> I know this is simple, but I am not doing a great job of finding it on google; I have some data returned froma  script, in the form of "<div class='foo'>bar</div>" (sans quotes) and I want to insert it into a page that then enacts its CSS appropriately on that string. How do I do this in jquery? .text(msg) seems to print the html out as a string
[00:07:15] <Cork> b0nn: .html()
[00:09:02] <b0nn> oh :(, I mean thanks, but I had read the api and thought .html() was for getting the html only (blonde moment I guess... if I were blonde..)
[00:12:30] <mgl> Is there somebody explain to me that why the datepicker and colorbox not working after upgrading jquery 1.4.2 to 1.9 ?
[00:17:37] <thevishy> are there any spellcheckers based on Jquery ?
[00:20:40] <Cork> mgl: make sure you have an updated version of jquery ui that supports 1.9
[00:22:08] <mgl> cork: thank you
[00:22:58] <kumar> Hello, drag and drop - listed items update to database tables use jquery
[00:24:30] <Cork> kumar: is that a question?
[00:24:43] <kumar> yes, any help
[00:25:13] <Cork> not sure what the question is...
[00:25:40] <kumar> cork:  drag and drop listed items use jquery.
[00:25:53] <mgl> colorbox is not included in ui ? i have a error: $(...).colorbox is not a function
[00:25:56] <Cork> that's a statement not a question...
[00:26:10] <Cork> mgl: nope it's a plugin
[00:27:09] <mgl> to fix that, should i upgrade colorbox plugin?
[00:28:22] <mgl> or how to fix that colorbox problem
[00:28:29] <Cork> ya
[00:30:35] <kumar> drag and drop in list items?
[00:32:30] <Cork> kumar: are you asking how to make a list that you can drag and drop items?
[00:32:41] <Chris_____> a bit of help with this http://pastebin.com/xjxLxzH9      , the form is loaded in colorbox , when submited : if it doesn;t validate it reloads , but when it validates it redirects to another page. The problem is that the redirected page loads inside the colorbox
[00:33:00] <kumar> cork: yes.
[00:33:14] <Cork> kumar: have a look at jquery ui sortable
[00:33:59] <Cork> kumar: alternatively draggable/droppable
[00:34:01] <kumar> cork: my code,
[00:34:11] <kumar> cork: $(document).ready(function(){  	    $('#sortTask').sortable({  	    	  	        update: function(event, ui) {  	        	  	        	forEach($scope.todos, function(todo) {			  	      		    	    		if(todo.task_id==task_id)  	    		{  	        	var newOrder = $(this).sortable('toArray').toString();  	        	$.post('index.php?option=com_ngtodo&controller=ajax&view=tasks', {ordering:newOrder});  	            console.log(newOrder)
[00:34:30] <Cork> kumar: don't dump code in the channel
[00:34:45] <kumar> k.
[00:35:30] <Cork> Chris_____: sounds like colorbox uses an iframe
[00:36:52] <kumar> sortable listed items
[00:36:53] <Chris_____> Cork: it is a DIV , not iframe
[00:37:00] <chandal> what effect is this theme using for the dropdown menus ? http://weblusive-themes.com/evolution/
[00:37:12] <Cork> Chris_____: so you append the content to the div then?
[00:37:17] <Cork> or replace
[00:37:25] <Chris_____> Cork: yes
[00:37:39] <Chris_____> Cork: replace
[00:37:44] <Cork> Chris_____: well then you have to append it to where you want it outside the colorbox then
[00:38:17] <Cork> chandal: looks like a opacity + margin animation
[00:39:22] <Cork> Chris_____: if you want to redirect the page in an ajax call, that isn't possible
[00:39:24] <Chris_____> Cork: still I need a way to see if the form validated: if the loaded page url is the url of the form load in the colorbox div if the result url is another page redirect to another page
[00:39:43] <Cork> Chris_____: js can't see if the request was redirected
[00:39:54] <Cork> at least not without special code server side
[00:41:22] <Chris_____> so no way to fund out the  the ajax post result url ?
[00:41:32] <Cork> no
[00:41:39] <Cork> not without the server setting something
[00:41:48] <Cork> like ex a header with the target url
[00:42:44] <Chris_____> in that case I will try adding a special div in the begining and run an if statment: if div found load normaly , otherwise redirect to another page
[01:08:03] <Asmooh> anyone has the issue that jquery does click 2 times on every request?
[01:08:56] <mgl> cork: i tried to upgrade iu, but still error : $(...).datePicker is not a function
[01:08:59] <Cork> Asmooh: when you bind two event listeners
[01:09:16] <Asmooh> i think i have not, at least not to the same file
[01:09:33] <Cork> mgl: datePicker isn't a jquery ui function
[01:09:41] <seutje> Asmooh: got code?
[01:09:54] <Cork> mgl: jquery ui defines datepicker
[01:10:13] <Asmooh> yea, but just in case  -> $.ajax({   thats jquery right?
[01:10:19] <Asmooh> because i do more things at same time
[01:10:21] <Cork> yes
[01:10:25] <Asmooh> and they wake me up to early today
[01:10:26] <Asmooh> :)
[01:12:20] <Asmooh> https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikzqy621lvr6wy2/whaaaa.txt
[01:12:52] <Asmooh> the problem is: when you upload it puts the file name in a temp database, this file saves the last step
[01:13:01] <Asmooh> but when i cancel 1 it should only do the last one
[01:13:12] <Asmooh> but it does 2 of them (even when i have 10 in the db)
[01:13:14] <Asmooh> so means 2 clicks
[01:13:28] <Asmooh> problem is in every version, i see a lot of double pictures in db from people
[01:13:43] <Cork> Asmooh: where are you running this codE?
[01:13:45] <Cork> *code
[01:13:50] <Asmooh> in my app
[01:13:54] <Cork> ...
[01:13:56] <seutje> wait, cancel? I don't see a cancel in here
[01:13:57] <Cork> where in the app...
[01:14:21] <Asmooh> in the step where you type something in about the photo and click 'save'
[01:14:27] <Asmooh> ...
[01:14:49] <Cork> Asmooh: is it in a partial you send through ajax, is it in head, is it in body at the bottom; where?
[01:15:02] <Asmooh> oh. in the body
[01:15:05] <Asmooh> around the middle
[01:15:15] <Cork> so it statically runs when the page loads?
[01:15:33] <Asmooh> it only loads when you click on the submit button
[01:16:04] <seutje> so it might just be loaded twice
[01:16:07] <Cork> so you run  $(function() {... $("#JqAjaxForm").submit(function(e){ on a submit click on something else?
[01:16:31] <Cork> Asmooh: you need context
[01:16:33] <seutje> no way for us to know from this snippet
[01:16:34] <Cork> it isn't here
[01:16:37] <Asmooh> <form id="JqAjaxForm">
[01:16:38] <Asmooh> <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" />
[01:16:38] <Asmooh> </form>
[01:16:44] <Cork> thats html not context
[01:17:11] <Cork> context is where the script runs, in what context it triggers, if it can be triggered more then once and so on
[01:17:12] <Asmooh> what do you mean exact with context
[01:17:19] <Cork> it is impossible to tell from you code example
[01:17:19] <Asmooh> ah okay
[01:17:25] <seutje> I'm confused... so u upload a picture, press submit, another form pops up?
[01:17:46] <seutje> and at this point it loads the submit behavior code for that form?
[01:18:08] <Asmooh> seutje, almost.. select photo -> upload -> loads: group_processphoto.html (editor + description) -> click -> db updates the info / photo -> done
[01:18:27] <seutje> this "loads", we talking pageload?
[01:18:46] <Asmooh> redirect to group_photoprocess.html
[01:18:59] <seutje> I heard a "yes" in there
[01:19:19] <Asmooh> window.location.assign
[01:19:35] <seutje> so the problem is in this html file, it submitting twice, right?
[01:19:57] <Asmooh> yes, the last part.. it works perfectly when there is no other file in the tempdb
[01:20:33] <seutje> well, ur not preventDefault()ing, so it's still doing a regular submit, right?
[01:21:09] <seutje> not sure how the DB contents could influence the frontend though
[01:23:04] <Guest79243> hi, some jquery pro here for helping a noob? ^^
[01:23:25] <Asmooh> seutje, well.. when you select 1 photo it uploads it so you can edit it, it puts the filename, your userid and stuff in a temp table in my db, then you get redirected to groups_processphoto.html , there you can edit it, put a description or just save it (will be posted on your timeline).. the last part does a server call, the server checks what your last uploaded photo is and moves it to the right folder.. lets say you cancel the upload,
[01:23:25] <Asmooh> when you upload a new photo it processes 2 of them because it clicks 2 times
[01:23:34] <Cork> ?ask @ Guest79243
[01:23:34] <b-ot> Guest79243: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:23:38] <Asmooh> and because the filename is different it sees it as 2 diffrent photos
[01:24:04] <Asmooh> it processes it also as 2 different photos
[01:24:12] <Cork> Asmooh: sounds like the preventDefault problem seutje talked about
[01:24:24] <Asmooh> only thing i can do i empty the tempdb on every request
[01:24:27] <Asmooh> hm
[01:24:57] <Cork> Asmooh: try adding event.preventDefault() before the ajax call
[01:25:07] <Cork> and event in the function attribute list
[01:25:11] <Cork> *arguments
[01:25:22] <seutje> he's already taking e as argument, just not using it yet
[01:25:35] <Guest79243> i'm trying to fadeIn a div with jQ. but it's already visible on pageload... tried everything like in css "visibility: hidden;" but then it's hidden all the time... Help :(
[01:25:43] <Cork> ah, so he does
[01:26:02] <Asmooh> event.preventDefault(e)
[01:26:02] <Asmooh> $(function(){
[01:26:02] <Asmooh>     $("#JqAjaxForm").submit(function(e){
[01:26:05] <Asmooh> like this you ment
[01:26:08] <Cork> Guest79243: $().hide().fadeIn('slow')
[01:26:09] <Asmooh> + ;
[01:26:10] <Asmooh> ofc
[01:26:15] <seutje> wat?
[01:26:18] <Cork> Asmooh: don't dump code in the channel
[01:26:21] <Asmooh> sorry
[01:26:35] <seutje> why are you passing the e to that function
[01:26:42] <Cork> Asmooh: no e.preventDefault();
[01:26:46] <Asmooh> oh i tought cork ment that
[01:26:47] <Asmooh> :)
[01:26:55] <Cork> Asmooh: e is the event object
[01:27:01] <Cork> passed to your event handler
[01:27:13] <seutje> now I totally don't understand why that e was there in the first place
[01:27:15] <Cork> it is the first argument passed to the function
[01:27:22] <Cork> heh
[01:27:31] <Cork> prob a copy paste from somewhere
[01:27:34] <seutje> my head hurts now :(
[01:28:06] <Asmooh> Cork, this was after trying long time the only one that worked without having to redirect to the server first
[01:28:08] <Asmooh> :)
[01:28:25] <sarahm> hello, i wrote a very simple function , a button with an action when its clicked: http://bpaste.net/show/5yKRqomrUp60ZgwGqGow/ , i don't know what i'mm missing because the alert is not executed
[01:29:01] <Asmooh> but i will repack my app and see what happens :)
[01:29:05] <Asmooh> otherwise i need to do it in php
[01:29:25] <Cork> sarahm: you try to find the button in the page before you append it
[01:29:36] <Cork> sarahm: use button on line 5 instead of $('#button')
[01:30:10] <Cork> sarahm: also you might want to look into event delegation
[01:30:15] <Guest79243> fadeIn in body or head?
[01:30:45] <Cork> Guest79243: doesn't really matter as long as the dom has been loaded before you run the code
[01:30:51] <sarahm> Cork: thank you, silly me ! whats event delegation?
[01:31:02] <Cork> ?api delegate
[01:31:02] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:31:11] <tobago> having an image element; how to select the input next to it?
[01:31:23] <tobago> tried: var input = $("#prev ~ input"); but didn't work
[01:31:24] <Cork> sarahm: .on can do the same thing with a special syntax
[01:31:33] <Cork> ?api on
[01:31:33] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:31:53] <Cork> sarahm: read through both pages and you should find how it works
[01:32:06] <Cork> tobago: .next()
[01:32:38] <Guest79243> @Cork: now it's hiding on page load with an animation and appears after animation :D
[01:32:39] <Cork> or if there can be something inbetween: $('#prev').nextAll('input').first()
[01:33:03] <Cork> Guest79243: then you are waiting too long to run the code
[01:33:06] <sarahm> Cork: thanks , i'll use on then .
[01:33:17] <Cork> Guest79243: try making an example of the problem in jsfiddle.net
[01:33:23] <Guest79243> k
[01:33:33] <Cork> sarahm: just make sure to use the delegate syntax for on, not just the normal one
[01:34:03] * Cork really don't like the "dual syntax" setup for on
[01:34:19] <Cork> makes it confusing for new developers...
[01:34:48] <sarahm> Cork: it is confusing
[01:35:03] <Cork> sarahm: think of on in this way; it is a combination function
[01:35:14] <Cork> it can do the same thing as .bind (the default format)
[01:35:26] <Cork> and it can do the same as .delegate (the format with a selector in it)
[01:36:04] <Cork> sarahm: so to learn how to do it you should prob start reading .delegate
[01:36:09] <Cork> as it is only about delegation
[01:36:20] <sarahm> Cork: ok then
[01:38:08] <sarahm> Cork: seems to me like delegate is useful when we want to attach an event to all buttons right? or am i missin somethin?
[01:38:32] <hemangpatel> How can i limit number of lines in textarea ?
[01:38:38] <Cork> sarahm: it is useful when you have a parent where you will later add buttons
[01:38:57] <Cork> sarahm: through this you can have a static event listener that handles the buttons as they are added to the page
[01:39:34] <Cork> hemangpatel: check input event and do event.preventDefault() when length > max
[01:40:57] <hemangpatel> Cork:  talking about number of lines
[01:41:20] <Cork> hemangpatel: number of lines
[01:41:26] <Cork> or number of had linebreaks
[01:41:42] <hemangpatel> Cork : no lines. I did linebreaks
[01:41:50] <Cork> the first one is kinda pointless, as that would depend on the width of the element the user choose
[01:41:56] <nFFF> hemangpatel, you specificy rows and cols
[01:41:58] <Asmooh> Cork, prevent seems to fix it
[01:42:00] <Asmooh> for now
[01:42:01] <Asmooh> thanks
[01:42:14] <nFFF> so just multiply them, and make sure the user doesn't go over the amoutn of chars?
[01:42:14] <hemangpatel> nFFF : not. But i can
[01:42:15] <Cork> hemangpatel: then check how many \n are in the field
[01:42:23] <Asmooh> i will still empty the db just in case
[01:42:38] <Cork> nFFF: rows doesn't limit how many you can enter
[01:42:54] <Cork> just the size of the element
[01:43:12] <hemangpatel> Cork : exactly i did that. But when i write continuously line break will not work
[01:43:28] <Cork> hemangpatel: ya, cause that's not linebreaks
[01:43:32] <Cork> it's wordwraps
[01:43:33] <hemangpatel> because cursor goes down
[01:43:49] <Cork> and that is close to impossible to calculate, cause if the user change the size of the field
[01:43:53] <Cork> that number will change
[01:44:17] <Cork> (the draggable corner on the bottom right)
[01:44:55] <sarahm> Cork:  i wrote it that way is it correct ? http://bpaste.net/show/ufvTWRo1gwrUaKqAK84Y/ ( it works fine but may be it is not the way it shld be )
[01:45:11] <Guest79243> CORK! the fiddle for the fadeIn problem: http://jsfiddle.net/Skusy/
[01:45:24] <nFFF> Cork, but you can check input against the size of colsxrows
[01:45:32] <Cork> sarahm: no, you don't run it in addButton
[01:45:36] <Cork> sarahm: that is the point
[01:45:41] <Multiply> nFFF :(
[01:45:58] <sarahm> Cork:  ah sorry ill change it
[01:46:28] <seutje> Guest79243: I suggest reading up the docs on hide, the only string argument it takes is a duration
[01:46:53] <Cork> Guest79243: http://jsfiddle.net/Skusy/1/
[01:47:37] <Guest79243> what did you changed cork?
[01:47:56] <Cork> Guest79243: removed the onload delay in the options on the left
[01:48:00] <Cork> and removed the string to hide()
[01:48:34] <Guest79243> ok, thx! trying it local
[01:48:36] <Cork> Guest79243: you can compare them with http://jsfiddle.net/Skusy/1/ and http://jsfiddle.net/Skusy/
[01:50:25] <tobago> i did $('my_radio_button').prop('checked', true), but $('my_radio_button').prop('checked') still is "undefined"
[01:50:45] <Cork> there is no element called my_radio_button
[01:50:53] <Cork> you prob want #my_radio_button
[01:51:02] <Guest79243> lol, it works,,, still don't get the difference
[01:51:41] <Cork> Guest79243: when you gave the id as a string to hide, it took it as an unparsable string and defaulted to "fast"
[01:51:50] <Cork> Guest79243: so .hide() did an animation
[01:52:17] <Cork> Guest79243: the onload thing was prob just a jsfiddle thing, many miss that
[01:53:43] <hemangpatel> I want to know that is it possible really ?
[01:54:13] <Cork> hemangpatel: it is, but it is quite hard
[01:54:26] <Cork> and you will break the minute the user resizes the textarea
[01:54:50] <Cork> as browsers won't tell you about the size change
[01:55:09] <hemangpatel> Cork : thanks . No problem
[01:55:14] <tobago> Cork, aaargh. my fault.
[01:57:14] <hemangpatel> Cork : Found this , http://jsfiddle.net/QmnwT/
[01:58:12] <Cork> hemangpatel: ya, but it will depend heavily on the ui
[01:58:42] <Cork> hemangpatel: btw, why do you want to control the number of lines against an unknown width?
[01:59:28] <Cork> hemangpatel: btw it calculates wrong if you resize the textfield
[02:00:16] <hemangpatel> Cork : I havetextraea with no re sizable
[02:00:36] <Cork> http://imagebin.org/270438
[02:01:24] <hemangpatel> Got it
[02:01:35] <Cork> hemangpatel: well the browser makes it resizable
[02:01:41] <Cork> it isn't something you have to do
[02:03:05] <hemangpatel> Cork : i set resize: none; in css.. If user change anything from source it's his problem :)
[02:03:50] <Cork> hemangpatel: and what about if the font you use doens't exist and the kerning of the one used differ?
[02:04:22] <Cork> my point is you depend on something that is fragile, and quite easily breaks
[02:04:36] <hemangpatel> Cork : :) Don't know . yes you are right
[02:05:16] <Cork> hemangpatel: you could add something that automatically inserts a hard line break after x characters
[02:05:20] <Cork> and then depend on that
[02:05:37] <hemangpatel> Cork : that's nice
[02:05:40] <Cork> and that would make sense, cause then you would have the same format server side when it is sent
[02:06:03] <Cork> hemangpatel: it becomes a bit complicated when users insert things in the middle though :)
[02:06:17] <Cork> what linebreaks to keep and what to remove ;)
[02:06:28] <hemangpatel> ok
[02:07:03] <Cork> hemangpatel: but honestly, why do you need number of lines?
[02:07:44] <Guest79243> cork, i think i got it.... many thanks, man!!
[02:10:28] <hemangpatel> Cork : i need to show 3 lines of use about me in his/her page
[02:10:48] <hemangpatel> So i want to limit it. Otherwise he/she can not read all his details
[02:11:09] <Cork> hemangpatel: why not just have a max number of characters
[02:11:23] <Cork> and let wordwrap handle it in the display
[02:15:47] <hemangpatel> Cork : If user will enter more lines it breaks css and other things
[02:16:27] <Cork> yay...
[02:16:28] <xec_> good riddance!
[02:16:28] <xec_> i hated those guys (shhhh don't tell them)
[02:16:30] <Cork> :D
[02:16:31] <Cork> that was a decent sized split
[02:16:31] <dingz> someone cut the cable ;)
[02:16:31] <guspollos> oh noes :(
[02:16:31] <guspollos> I was just getting some opinion on my new web design
[02:16:31] <xec_> was the feedback good or bad?
[02:16:31] <Cork> lol
[02:16:32] <Cork> "<erry> and what does THIS button do?"
[02:16:38] <seutje> oh man
[02:16:38] <seutje> oh the lags
[02:17:01] <Cork> hemangpatel: why not just have the element as overflow: auto; ?
[02:17:05] <jonkristian_wrk> Any jquery suggest/typeahead or similar that only does the low-level stuff and lets me output content in my own way? twitter's typeahead is nice but it's template thing is really kinda hard, I wrote something myself, it works but it's not perfect. Looking for good suggestions or success stories;)
[02:17:40] <hemangpatel> Cork : client does not want it :)
[02:17:58] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: by typeahead you mean inline autocomplete?
[02:18:08] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, yes
[02:18:27] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: there should be a quite large set of plugins for that
[02:18:34] <Cork> just google around a bit
[02:18:36] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, I am interested in other approaches as well, I've seen a couple that does filtering on already output'ed content
[02:19:03] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, yeah it's a jungle, just thought i'd ask here if maybe someone had anything special that worked well for them.
[02:19:47] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: google is your friend :)
[02:20:03] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, :)
[02:20:10] <xec_> jonkristian_wrk: tried http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ ?
[02:20:47] <jonkristian_wrk> xec_, the thing is, i already use bootstrap, and would like to keep things as slim as possible.
[02:21:13] <xec_> jquery ui is modular...
[02:21:14] <jonkristian_wrk> xec_, maybe it can be slimmed down, but then doesnt jquery-ui have a lot of css and stylings
[02:21:40] <xec_> for an autocomplete to work, you're likely to need some css, indeed
[02:21:44] <jonkristian_wrk> I mean styling and html output
[02:22:19] <jonkristian_wrk> xec_, yeah of course, I already have my own format that works well with the site I am working on.
[02:22:28] <jonkristian_wrk> formatting*
[02:22:30] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: jquery ui autocomplete do have a default css rule, but you can throw that away if you like
[02:22:42] <Cork> some of it you would have to readd for things to work
[02:22:57] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, xec_ I'll give it a go:)
[02:22:59] <Cork> but most of it can be restyled almost how ever you like
[02:23:05] <Cork> though it isn't inline
[02:23:09] <Cork> and won't ever be
[02:23:13] <jonkristian_wrk> I might need some datepickers and timepickers as well, so it might not be a bad idea
[02:25:32] <jonkristian_wrk> This looks very interesting, but it seems that it doesn't have autocomplete:/ http://addyosmani.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/
[02:25:55] <jonkristian_wrk> I take that back
[02:26:04] <Tomashe> $(".ticket").delay(3000).hide(); < anyone knows why the its not delay before hide ?
[02:26:06] <jonkristian_wrk> Thanks guys, will test now
[02:26:12] <Tomashe> it just hide it without the 3 seconds wait
[02:26:52] <Cork> Tomashe: cause hide() isn't animating
[02:27:03] <Cork> $(".ticket").delay(3000).hide(1);
[02:27:15] <Cork> Tomashe: delay only works for animations
[02:27:22] <Tomashe> ohh i see
[02:27:25] <Tomashe> ok so hide 1 will fix it ?
[02:27:27] <Tomashe> lets check
[02:27:39] <Cork> Tomashe: i would prob not go that way anyway
[02:27:51] <Tomashe> ok so what u offer?
[02:28:09] <Cork> Tomashe: setTimeout(function() { $(".ticket").hide(); }, 3000) is a cleaner solution
[02:28:47] <Tomashe> ok thanks baro
[02:28:49] <Tomashe> bro
[02:29:40] <Cork> Tomashe: if you need to chain it you could do something like http://jsfiddle.net/89bZs/
[02:30:07] <Tomashe> no chain neded thanks  :)
[02:30:18] <Christer> Hi all, my server doesnt recieve the POST data - Do you see anything wrong? : http://pastebin.com/4VHquZ92 -
[02:31:58] <Cork> Christer: should a mapid=test
[02:32:01] <Cork> (param string)
[02:33:43] <Christer> cork: what? If you look at the examples on the documentation (all the way on the bottom, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) it clearly says ex.: data { name: "John" }
[02:34:24] <Cork> ya?
[02:34:42] <Cork> Christer: what i meant is data: {mapid: 'test'}, would be converted to mapid=test and sent as a param string
[02:35:22] <Cork> or www-form-urlencoded if you prefer that
[02:35:40] <Christer> on POST? isnt that GET?
[02:35:51] <Cork> both use urlencoded
[02:35:58] <Cork> the difference is that post has it in body
[02:36:00] <Christer> this should be returned as $_POST['mapid'] on the server side i tought.
[02:36:03] <Cork> while get has it in the url
[02:36:08] <Cork> yes
[02:36:18] <Christer> yes, and thats null :P
[02:36:43] <Cork> check so your server isn't resetting it somehow
[02:37:11] <krambiorix> hi, i use this to filter my autocomplete source: var matcher = new RegExp($.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex(request.term), "i");   -> how can i change this so when i type for exampl '1' , that it filters all strings BEGINNING with 1 ?
[02:38:39] <Cork> "^" +
[02:40:38] <Nanor> Hey, my .click() method won't work on <a> elements but works fine on others. Any idea what's causing this?
[02:41:00] <krambiorix> Cork so "^i" ?
[02:41:08] <Cork> Nanor: event.preventDefault()
[02:41:21] <Cork> krambiorix: no prepend it to the escaped string
[02:42:16] <krambiorix> Cork, so :  "^"+request.term
[02:42:21] <Cork> no
[02:42:30] <Cork> the escaped string
[02:42:46] <Cork> (if you don't know what i'm talking about, read the function names)
[02:43:05] <Nanor> Cork, I tried that. It doesn't work. Am I doing it wrong? http://pastebin.com/nvaKSBdt
[02:43:24] <Cork> Nanor: that will work
[02:43:40] <Cork> Nanor: only option left is that the tag doens't exist when you run the selector
[02:43:57] <Cork> (or as it's twitter; is in an iframe)
[02:44:43] <Nanor> Cork, Ah, that seems pretty likely
[02:46:36] <BarneyS> I'm not able to Show Keyboard on Input Focus. .  I've tried this  setTimeout(function() {
[02:46:37] <BarneyS> 		$('#text1').focus();
[02:46:39] <BarneyS> 	}, 0);   It focusses but does not display keyboard on Android device
[02:46:45] <BarneyS> Can anyone help me out on this one
[02:47:16] <Cork> barneybook: try click
[02:47:21] <Cork> opps
[02:47:25] <Cork> *BarneyS:
[02:47:54] <BarneyS> ohk
[02:47:59] <BarneyS> lemme do it
[02:49:32] <james_woods> Hi, my question might be really stupid but what I am trying to achieve with jquery is to catch the event when this dropdown (http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/) here gets closed. I tried to insert the button with a onblur= option - but this is also triggered when options in the multiselect dropdown get selected/deselected
[02:50:13] <james_woods> I dont want to submit the request everytime a option gets selected, but when the dropdown gets closed
[02:50:28] <Cork> james_woods: try the change event
[02:50:47] <Cork> james_woods: there most likely isn't an event for when it's closed
[02:50:49] <BarneyS> Nope it's not working on click
[02:51:03] <Cork> BarneyS: then it might be you can't fake that
[02:51:19] <BarneyS> Cork: there might be some way to do it
[02:51:21] <Cork> BarneyS: btw are you triggering this on page load?
[02:51:25] <BarneyS> yes
[02:51:37] <Cork> try waiting for the onload event before you trigger it
[02:51:53] <BarneyS> ohk
[02:52:05] <Cork> i have a vague memory it was something with a race problem doing something like that
[02:52:09] <james_woods> Cork: but the change event fires everytime when something gets selected. I have the source of this plugin so I could write my own event for the closing... I mean there must be some event that gets triggered when the dropdown disappears or?
[02:53:00] <Cork> james_woods: for the js enhancement you prob could add something; but for the select fallback; no there isn't
[02:53:02] <krambiorix> Cork, ok thanks! it works
[02:53:06] <BarneyS> Nope it's not working
[02:53:11] <BarneyS> I've tried it on ready
[02:54:09] <Cork> BarneyS: no not on ready
[02:54:11] <Cork> on load
[02:54:26] <Cork> and you might even have to use a timer from that one
[02:54:38] <BarneyS> yes, i'll do that..
[02:54:42] <james_woods> Cork: what do you mean by js enhancement? The page wont be used browsers without javascript so I can rely on that, but I dont know how to catch the blur event correctly
[02:54:52] <ttl112> I'm submitting ajax form with IE and it pushes JSON to nodejs. nodejs receives it in this format "name=testname&surname=test&email=aa%40aa.com&phone=01232131111". what this format is called? I'm looking on making it in to json
[02:55:04] <james_woods> s/used browsers/used with browsers
[02:55:07] <Cork> BarneyS: something like $(document).on('load', function() { setTimeout(function() { .focus(); }, 1000) });
[02:55:32] <nawi> android built-in browser seems to require two taps to submit a button with :hover state, how to make the first tap submit the form?
[02:55:43] <Cork> james_woods: js can be disabled, or the js files might be blocked for a long list of reasons
[02:55:52] <nawi> jquery-mobile adds hover css to the button as far as I know
[02:56:08] <Cork> james_woods: so no, if you want to make a compatible webpage you shouldn't depend on js being there
[02:56:14] <james_woods> Cork: No, its a intranet site. so I can rely on that, I just dont know which event to catch
[02:56:23] <Cork> james_woods: no event
[02:56:27] <james_woods> Cork: it does not need to be compatible
[02:56:38] <Cork> you would have to make the js generated select replacement generate something
[02:56:46] <Cork> or have a callback when it hides the element
[02:56:50] <BarneyS> Cork: No it's not happening
[02:57:14] <james_woods> Cork: yes, I was trying to find out how to generate a callback when it hides the element
[02:57:35] <Cork> james_woods: you would have to look at the code generating the select replacement element
[02:57:52] <Cork> james_woods: there is no way to get an event from the native select tag
[02:57:58] <Cork> just like there is no way to style that element
[02:58:35] <Cork> (also note replacement select elements tend to break in mobile/touch browsers)
[02:58:44] <BarneyS> Cork: Is it because of some issue with Android device??
[02:59:15] <Cork> BarneyS: it most likely comes from that mobile browsers doesn't use the form elements in the page
[02:59:25] <Cork> they actually lay overlays over the page and do the editing there
[02:59:41] <Cork> you can see these overlays get out of sync sometimes on a mobile
[02:59:55] <BarneyS> Yes exactly!!
[03:00:13] <james_woods> Cork: thats fine, I will try to find that element and see if I can bind towards the hide() or show of it thanks
[03:00:30] <Cork> james_woods: you would prob have to modify the original library
[03:00:41] <james_woods> Cork: thats what i am doing right now
[03:00:56] <BarneyS> But there should be a way to do it, either using .live or something like that
[03:01:02] <james_woods> Cork: i was just asking where to look and what to add
[03:01:13] <Cork> BarneyS: live won't help you here at all
[03:01:31] <Cork> BarneyS: also note .live has been depricated for quite some time and is removed since 1.9
[03:01:42] <BarneyS> Cork: But JQM refreshes the DOM everytime
[03:01:48] <daslicht> why is my mousemove handler not removed on mouseup ?
[03:01:48] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/5nppb/4/
[03:02:32] <Cork> daslicht: there is no handler in that page
[03:02:40] <daslicht> delegate
[03:02:47] <Cork> there is no delegate in that page
[03:02:58] <Cork> there is only a ready no event listeners at all
[03:03:24] <daslicht> huh
[03:03:26] <daslicht> one sec
[03:03:50] <daslicht> freaking js fiddle
[03:04:10] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/5nppb/7/
[03:04:27] <daslicht> somethimes js fiddle do not keep my changes whyever
[03:04:44] <daslicht> essentially i like to create a resize handle for that image
[03:04:46] <Cork> daslicht: you shouldn't bind event listeners in event listeners like that
[03:05:01] <Cork> set a value and check it in the other event listener
[03:05:04] <daslicht> do you please like to show me the correct way ?
[03:05:19] <daslicht> i see
[03:05:31] <Cork> uh wait it would be even simpler
[03:06:38] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/5nppb/8/
[03:07:37] <dotwired> hi. how can i apply a fade effect to jquery ui tabs widget?
[03:08:28] <dotwired> used to do that with fx: { toggle: 'opacity', duration: 200 } or similar but obviously that doesnt work for current versions any more
[03:08:46] <BarneyS> Cork: I'm not able to find any solution for that!!. .
[03:09:03] <Cork> BarneyS: not sure there is one
[03:09:38] <daslicht> Cork: Like this : http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/5nppb/9/ ?
[03:09:56] <daslicht> Cork: you example fires anytime events here
[03:11:18] <GreatPotato> I need to select all LI elements except the current hovered li, and the previous one… Any idea?
[03:11:22] <GreatPotato> Should i use eq?
[03:11:27] <BarneyS> Cork: Thanks buddy!!
[03:11:36] <Cork> daslicht: opps it should be 1 not 0 :)
[03:11:43] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/5nppb/10/
[03:12:44] <Cork> GreatPotato: $('li).not($(this).prev().add(this))
[03:12:50] <Cork> GreatPotato: * $('li').not($(this).prev().add(this))
[03:12:58] <daslicht> not doing anything here ?
[03:13:18] <Cork> daslicht: not even if you click the button and move the mouse?
[03:13:19] <GreatPotato> Aha, i didn't know about add(), thanks Cork
[03:13:32] <daslicht> nope :)
[03:14:45] <daslicht> hm in firefox it is working
[03:17:55] <Cork> daslicht: lovely... looks the the button/buttons property is totally broken on mousemove >_<
[03:18:01] <Cork> totally forgot that...
[03:18:03] <daslicht> heh
[03:18:09] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/5nppb/11/
[03:18:12] <Cork> daslicht: ya, you would have to use the variable solution
[03:18:13] <daslicht> i have something like this now
[03:18:40] <Cork> daslicht: though there is a buttons option on the way for the standard
[03:18:54] <Cork> though webkit doesn't seam to support it yet
[03:18:58] <daslicht> how would you approach to make the handle moveable ?
[03:19:05] <daslicht> and finally my image resizeable?
[03:19:19] <Cork> daslicht: i would prob drop all the custom code and use jquery ui draggable
[03:19:20] <dotwired> nobody knows? :-/
[03:19:50] <daslicht> Cork: Thats what I am using at the moment , but I would love to learn how to create it myself
[03:20:12] <daslicht> the bad thing about resizeable is that it will add a div around teh image
[03:20:29] <daslicht> and if you destroy it the div will be removed either
[03:20:47] <daslicht> but lets say you have an img inside that div
[03:20:48] <Cork> daslicht: for that kind of code you most likely want to bind the event listener for the entire document
[03:20:56] <daslicht> and you want to have the image float right
[03:20:58] <Cork> else the code would "drop" the element if you move too fast
[03:21:24] <daslicht> yeh i have that in the latter fiddle
[03:21:31] <Cork> and for that, then yes you want to have the event bound from mousedown ^^'
[03:22:03] <daslicht> ?
[03:22:15] <daslicht> bind mousemove insidne mousedown ?
[03:22:21] <daslicht> inside
[03:22:26] <Cork> you don't want to leave a document wide listener around from your widget
[03:22:27] <Cork> ya
[03:22:49] <daslicht> thats how i had it at teh beginning, but how to remove the listener
[03:22:55] <daslicht> off wasnt doing teh job here
[03:24:02] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/5nppb/12/
[03:24:25] <Cork> opps you want to move mouseup into the mousedown code too
[03:25:01] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/5nppb/13/
[03:25:15] <daslicht> so thats a named event ?
[03:25:29] <Cork> namespaced events
[03:25:35] <daslicht> cool
[03:25:36] <daslicht> ok
[03:26:32] <Cork> from the mousedown event you grab the screenX/screenY position
[03:26:44] <Cork> and then on mousemove you calculate the change from that position
[03:26:55] <Cork> and move the element accordingly
[03:27:03] <daslicht> ok let me try :)
[03:27:24] <Cork> note i use clientX/clientY in the fiddle, and that's wrong
[03:28:42] <Cork> oh.. lovely
[03:28:46] <Cork> chrome can't count >_<
[03:29:32] <daslicht> why is cleintY wrong ?
[03:29:41] <Cork> depricated
[03:33:05] <james_woods> Cork: okay, I have it now in Firefox and see that the button.multiselect triggers a blur event when it disappears
[03:33:18] <daslicht> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.clientX
[03:33:25] <james_woods> Cork: but somehow I am unable to listen to that event
[03:34:18] <james_woods> Cork: I see the element in the console and wrapped it around a div (id 500) and selected it by $('#500').children('button').first();
[03:34:49] <james_woods> Cork: the triggered event is: blur >>  button.multiselect
[03:35:18] <james_woods> Cork: but a     $('#500').children('button').first().blur(function() {
[03:35:36] <james_woods> does not get fired. I think I am doing something fundamentally wrong here..
[03:46:52] <Nanor> Can I bind a click method to an iframe?
[03:48:30] <Cork> Nanor: no
[03:48:43] <Cork> well not unless the content of the iframe is from the same domain
[03:49:32] <Nanor> bah, oh well
[03:50:07] <Cork> Nanor: it's an important restriction, else it could be used for click jacking from third party pages
[03:50:47] <Nanor> Cork, I suppose. Thanks!
[03:52:03] <Cork> <iframe src="your-login-page.php" onkeyup="storeUsernameAndPassword(event)"> *opps* :D
[03:52:44] <XaroRSA> Hi peeps
[03:52:50] <XaroRSA> I have a JS object
[03:53:07] <XaroRSA> unction jgauge_widgetlist() {   var widgets = {     "jgauge":     { 	  "objectname":"name",
[03:53:27] <XaroRSA> function jgauge_widgetlist() {   var widgets = {     "jgauge":     { 	  "objectname":"name",       "offsetx":-80,"offsety":-80,"width":160,"height":160,       "menu":"Widgets",
[03:53:30] <Cork> ?p @ XaroRSA
[03:53:47] <Cork> xarg: paste code in a pastebin and give the url instead
[03:53:58] <Cork> *XaroRSA:
[03:54:02] <XaroRSA> How would i edit the offsetx property with jquery?
[03:54:32] <XaroRSA> currently $(this).attr("name",5); works
[03:54:40] <XaroRSA> to change the name
[03:54:49] <XaroRSA> but seems like a bad way to do it
[03:56:08] <XaroRSA> http://pastebin.com/a3kkCGz1
[03:56:44] <Cork> XaroRSA: what converts the object to dom elements?
[03:57:39] <Cork> XaroRSA: you would have to look into what the library does with those values
[03:57:50] <XaroRSA> http://pastebin.com/UqUEtZH3
[03:58:10] <XaroRSA> It all works as it is there
[03:58:14] <chandal> Cork do you know Dominic Cork
[03:58:27] <Cork> chandal: don't think so
[03:58:49] <XaroRSA> when i set the attribute name to 5
[03:58:55] <XaroRSA> $(this).attr("name",5);
[03:59:01] <XaroRSA> within the each loop
[03:59:06] <XaroRSA> it works
[03:59:19] <Cork> XaroRSA: something takes the jquery object you have and creates a dom structure from it
[03:59:35] <Cork> what those values becomes is defined by that library
[03:59:47] <Cork> it isn't something that can generically answered
[03:59:53] <Cork> *can be
[04:00:24] <XaroRSA> ok let me rephase
[04:00:36] <XaroRSA> How can i change the value of a objet
[04:00:39] <XaroRSA> object
[04:00:42] <XaroRSA> wait
[04:00:52] <XaroRSA> change the propery of a object
[04:00:57] <XaroRSA> eg the "offsetx"
[04:01:05] <XaroRSA> which doesnt have attributes
[04:01:10] <Christer> object.offsetx = kddkd ?
[04:01:49] <XaroRSA> lemme try it quick
[04:01:53] <Cork> XaroRSA: $(this) has nothing to do with objects
[04:02:05] <Cork> so the question you ask isn't "how to change the object"
[04:02:10] <Cork> it is "what happens with these values"
[04:02:50] <Layke> Can I pass a domNode to $().. I just want to pass a domNode to start a plugin. All the examples just use selectors.
[04:02:56] <Cork> XaroRSA: and your code doesn't contain how the widget object gets convert to dom objects
[04:03:26] <Cork> Layke: ever used $(this)  ? ;)
[04:03:26] <XaroRSA> $(this).offsetx=5 ?
[04:03:32] <Cork> XaroRSA: no
[04:03:41] <XaroRSA> whats within the each loop
[04:03:49] <Cork> XaroRSA: please read the responses you've gotten
[04:04:07] <XaroRSA> var feed = $(this).attr("feed");
[04:04:11] <Cork> no
[04:04:16] <XaroRSA> that is also in the each loop
[04:04:20] <Layke> Cork, the examples have something like  $("a").tooltip(); .. I just want to run it on a single domNode..  $( domNode).tooltip();
[04:04:21] <Cork> please read the responses you've gotten
[04:04:22] <Layke> Which fails*
[04:04:50] <Cork> Layke: yave you ever used $(this) ?
[04:04:54] <Layke> (I'm not from a jquery background). I use dojo. But using jquery for something.
[04:04:58] <Cork> *have
[04:04:58] <Layke> No Cork
[04:05:17] <Cork> Layke: ok it is the standard way to target the current element in event handlers
[04:05:47] <lundy> heya folks wots the best way to redirect a page in jquery?
[04:05:48] <Cork> this is the dom element the event triggered on and yes $(this) takes the element this points to and wraps it in a jquery object
[04:06:07] <Cork> Layke: so the long way around yes you can pass a dom element to jquery and it will wrap it
[04:06:17] <Cork> lundy: window.location = "new url"
[04:06:26] <Christer> btw Cork. I still cant figgure out the ajax problem. It doesnt look like the ajax call POST's at all. Nothing is sent in the header except for the actual POST, no data is sent.
[04:06:40] <XaroRSA> o wait a min
[04:06:44] <Cork> Christer: is the target server the same domain?
[04:06:49] <Christer> yeah.
[04:06:50] <Clorith> Hi, trying to detect if first/last entry in a table is visible (the table has a limited height and is therefore scrollable), is this evenpossible? (considering the elements are technically still in the viewport, all my attempts at .is(":visible") and various plugins to check visibilityhave failed)
[04:06:54] <Christer> its my localhost.
[04:06:55] <XaroRSA> so if the object isnt made into a dom element
[04:06:59] <XaroRSA> it wont find it
[04:07:12] <Cork> Christer: have a look in the browsers network tab
[04:07:14] <XaroRSA> or parts of the dom
[04:07:27] <XaroRSA> parts of the object
[04:07:28] <Christer> yeah, did that. and it sending a request to the correct location.
[04:07:32] <Christer> but without the "data"
[04:07:39] <Cork> XaroRSA: yes jquery is for dom modifications, it has nothing to do with javascript objects
[04:07:46] <XaroRSA> omg
[04:07:48] <XaroRSA> sorry
[04:07:51] <XaroRSA> ok my bad
[04:07:55] <XaroRSA> no wonder
[04:08:21] <XaroRSA> OK no worries
[04:08:22] <XaroRSA> :D
[04:08:27] <Christer> Clorith, Have you tried just printing out the first / last object to see if its targets the correct one?
[04:08:32] <XaroRSA> the attr function still works
[04:08:36] <anli> I am trying to call a function outside a popup window, but window.opener.document.func does not seem to work, actually, I have used window.opener.func successfully before
[04:08:46] <Christer> Clorith: Tablerow* not object.
[04:08:46] <anli> Whats the correct thing to do?
[04:09:10] <Clorith> Christer: I do have a fiddle up, the idea is to detect if they are visible after scrolling as well so currently I have http://jsfiddle.net/Clorith/m9XFb/
[04:09:16] <Cork> Clorith: :visible is for checking if the element is display: none, visibility: hidden or opacity: 0;
[04:09:28] <Cork> Clorith: it is NOT to check if it is scrolled into view; you need a plugin for that
[04:09:44] <Cork> XaroRSA: cause you work on a dom element, not the object
[04:09:49] <Clorith> Cork: That's what I figured, so I grabbed aviewport plugin, but it also keeps saying it's visible, because the entire table is technically in the viewport
[04:09:53] <Christer> aha, visible like that.. Look at what Cork said :)
[04:10:35] <Cork> Clorith: the plugin would have to check in relation to the overflow parent of the table
[04:10:37] <XaroRSA> OK so ill look through the code where that object get appended
[04:10:45] <Cork> *converted
[04:10:53] <Cork> you can't append a js object to the dom
[04:11:04] <Clorith> I did try https://github.com/teamdf/jquery-visible/
[04:11:49] <Cork> Clorith: looks like that plugin only takes the full page viewport into account
[04:12:04] <Cork> and doesn't check if the element has a parent with overflow
[04:12:29] <Clorith> yeah, I've not found anything that does just element view, and I must admit I'm at a loss what to search for to find such a plugin
[04:12:37] <Cork> (and yes you would have to check every parent with overflow)
[04:13:05] <Cork> Clorith: you would have to on each scroll loop over each parent with overflow + the page viewport to really know if it is in view
[04:13:18] <Cork> as each scrollable element can hide the target
[04:13:47] <Cork> Clorith: and really, you might be better of checking in another way
[04:13:53] <Cork> Clorith: what is it your trying to do?
[04:14:32] <Christer> What about determining the position of an element on pageload, and then check if the position of the row is within the containers viewport?
[04:15:01] <Clorith> Cork: I need to display a text if the first or last element of the table isn't visible
[04:15:10] <Clorith> Sot of a "there are more entries you just have ot scroll"
[04:15:22] <Cork> Clorith: only in relation to the table?
[04:15:34] <Cork> or in relation to the page too?
[04:15:35] <Clorith> So I don't care if it's visible to the ful lviewport, only to that parent <table> tag
[04:15:53] <Cork> so what you actually want to know if is the overflow parent is scrolling?
[04:16:15] <Cork> or can it scroll while still not be at the top/bottom?
[04:16:18] <Clorith> aye, and if it's scrolled to a point where the first or last row is hidden
[04:16:31] <Cork> that would be doable
[04:18:18] <Cork> $('overflow-parent').on('scroll', function() { $('first-element').offset().top > this.scrollTop) {} if($('table').offset().top + $('table').height() > this.scrollHeight) {} })
[04:18:43] <Cork> hmm or did the offset change...
[04:18:45] * Cork checks
[04:20:31] <sarahm> Hello, I fetch some data with ajax , and i want to return the data, instead of executing some function on success. http://bpaste.net/show/lGH69I52TPGbFRgM246I/
[04:20:48] <seutje> ?ajax101
[04:20:49] <b-ot> seutje: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[04:20:59] <seutje> sarahm: can't return from async calls
[04:21:12] <Clorith> Seems offset doesn't react that way =/
[04:21:14] <seutje> it returns a deferred and u can work with that
[04:22:25] <sarahm> seutje : ok thats what i saw on SO, it just bothers me to call the function successFN inside, because then i'll have to pass a lot of params to the ajax_call.
[04:23:35] <seutje> sarahm: what are you trying to do exactly?
[04:25:42] <sarahm> seutje: i fetch some xml data then i parse it , apply xpath etc .. , so if i have to do the parsing in the success case i have to give the xpaths
[04:26:53] <Cork> Clorith: http://jsfiddle.net/KqKjU/
[04:27:32] <seutje> sarahm: I guess, but you could just pass it a function that's a called with a reference to the url so it can lookup the xpaths like that
[04:29:02] <Cork> ?api jquery.Callback
[04:29:02] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:29:04] <Cork> ?api jquery.Callbacka
[04:29:06] <Cork> bah
[04:29:07] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:29:09] <Cork> ?api jquery.Callbacks
[04:29:12] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.Callbacks(): A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[04:31:02] <sarahm> seutje : i haven't thought of that, i'll try it
[04:31:29] <Cork> sarahm: if you need to handle more then one callback function have a look at that helper ^
[04:31:50] <seutje> Cork: osnap, didn't know about that
[04:32:09] <Cork> seutje: it is the old $._Deferred() function renamed
[04:32:14] <tjz> hi guys
[04:32:27] <Christer> Cork, found the issue. The javascript methodname got overwritten -.-
[04:32:51] <Christer> Same method, but not the same parameters
[04:32:54] <Cork> Christer: heh
[04:32:56] <Cork> ouch
[04:33:57] <sarahm> Cork: ok thank you
[04:34:08] <Cork> i implemented csp on our main site a few months ago, and had to move to 100% static preloaded js
[04:34:42] <Cork> was a hell to get through at the beginning, but it actually helps getting the site in a structured fashion
[04:34:54] <Cork> don't think i would ever go back to dynamic js anymore
[04:35:53] <seutje> I don't even understand the difference q.q
[04:36:41] <aquery> Hello
[04:36:48] <Clorith> Cork: That seems great, but I think the dataTable I'm wrapping it in is messign with that approach =/
[04:37:36] <Cork> seutje: inline script is banned, sending js in ajax callbacks banned
[04:37:53] <seutje> oh
[04:37:54] <Cork> seutje: everything that has to exist in the page js wise has to be loaded on first page load
[04:38:05] <Cork> and everything else needs to utilize function calls instead
[04:38:36] <lundy> how can I click a image and check a radio button ?
[04:38:49] <Cork> seutje: cause a <script></script> tag in html won't even parse ^^
[04:39:01] <seutje> how about ajax calls that contain a method name to be executed?
[04:39:03] <Cork> and eval is blocked
[04:39:35] <Cork> seutje: well if the function requesting the ajax call has a success callback and grabs the name from ex. json, then ya it works
[04:39:46] <Cork> (and that is how i solve the limitations :) )
[04:39:46] <seutje> silly example: { command: 'append', content: 'foo' } $foo[data.command](data.content);
[04:39:55] <Cork> exactly
[04:40:22] <seutje> yeah, do that a lot
[04:40:35] <Cork> ya, me too, but never been this strict about it
[04:40:41] <seutje> well, usually I won't directly use jQuery methods, but only methods internal to the app
[04:40:53] <Cork> the "you can't do this" kinda helps you keep it clean :D
[04:41:01] <sysdef> i think {"command":"append","content":"foo"} is way better
[04:41:36] <Cork> seutje: then comes the interesting question, you need to run that function when the page loads directly
[04:41:41] <Cork> how do you do it? :D
[04:41:57] <Cork> (think pushState vs normal load)
[04:42:42] <seutje> this was a reaction to a response, so I wouldn't have any data to use o.O
[04:43:26] <seutje> sysdef: not sure what ur getting at
[04:43:31] <Cork> seutje: actually it's fairly simple put the command (and in my case command-group) as data- tags on head
[04:43:44] <Cork> and have a static function that grabs those values
[04:44:02] <Cork> seutje: the ajax call has an equiv full page load
[04:44:05] <seutje> oh u mean how to avoid running an init that's tightly locked to the page?
[04:44:25] <Cork> well not avoid the oposite
[04:44:25] <seutje> or do an initial ajax request
[04:44:27] <Cork> actually run it
[04:44:55] <Cork> something like createSliders() needs to be called when the form has been loaded
[04:45:08] <seutje> oh like that
[04:45:10] <Cork> even if it is through a normal http request for the html file
[04:45:18] <seutje> yeah, just do it like angular directives
[04:45:51] <Cork> normally i just had an inline script tag doing the call in those cases
[04:45:54] <daslicht> i love find()
[04:46:01] <seutje> I rarely have the privilege to decide this though
[04:46:05] <Cork> fitted best with the server framework
[04:46:13] <seutje> usually have to do work on an existing project
[04:46:19] <Cork> well i develop everything for this system
[04:46:31] <Cork> from the database all the way to css
[04:46:38] <seutje> wish I could do that, just maintain a single product for a while
[04:46:53] <Cork> seutje: isn't a single project though >_>
[04:47:04] <seutje> cause now I constantly think "I'll refactor this later"... but never get to it :(
[04:47:05] <Cork> this is the major one, but i have 4 others on my hand...
[04:47:14] <seutje> yeah, that wasn't the point :P
[04:47:14] <Cork> heh ya know the feeling
[04:47:51] <seutje> if ur just churning out site/app after site/app, you don't get to do things right most of the time and end up not having enough time to go back to it
[04:48:15] <Cork> ah, ya, i normally don't do consulting work anymore
[04:48:20] <Cork> i did a few years back
[04:48:43] <Cork> but then the company needed the work time for in-hose so we stopped taking jobs
[04:48:55] <Cork> was quite a big change
[04:49:02] <seutje> I bet
[04:49:18] <seutje> I would kill for proper code reviews
[04:49:37] <Cork> drupal +own php +js => rails, go, python + js + css (all own)
[04:50:03] <Cork> well except for the rails base framework that is
[04:50:12] <Cork> but we mostly just use rails for activerecord
[04:50:25] <withanx> is there a separate room for jquery mobile?
[04:50:32] <Cork> withanx: nope
[04:51:23] <withanx> anyone know why a link to a panel in jquery mobile would ignore other bound events?
[04:51:44] <Clorith> Thanks Cork though, that's the edge I needed to start figuring this out :D
[04:52:47] <withanx> $(document).on('click', 'a.link_to_panel', function() { console.info("clicked"); }) - never gets triggered if the link is to a panel that exists.  If I change the link to an identifier that doesn't exist, the event triggers fine
[04:55:24] <Cork> Clorith: sounds like you have something doing return false; or event.stopPropagation() somewhere
[04:55:29] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[04:55:33] <Cork> withanx: ^
[04:55:49] <Cork> though i'm no expert on jqm
[04:55:58] <withanx> I'm not doing it, JQM must be doing it
[04:57:18] <Cork> withanx: ya, sorry can't help
[04:57:39] <Cork> withanx: there are ppl good with jqm in here from time to time though, might be worth asking again in a while
[04:57:59] <withanx> ok ty
[05:05:48] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/LBnJF/ - anyone know where i am going wrong here? i want it so that if u click the image it ticks the radio button ?
[05:06:35] <Cork> lundy: why not just put everything in a label element?
[05:06:42] <Cork> and then you won't need js at all
[05:06:50] <lundy> amm
[05:07:17] <Cork> everything is each group that is
[05:07:22] <lundy> as in <label><img src=""><input type="radio"></label> ?
[05:07:27] <Cork> yes
[05:09:07] <lundy> ok
[05:10:08] <lundy> Cork, do you mean like <label name="1"><img src=""><input></label> <label name="2">............
[05:10:22] <Cork> lundy: http://jsfiddle.net/LBnJF/1/
[05:14:03] <MariusIT> what's the proper way to do this? http://pastebin.com/tFnZaHbq replacing the html content seems hacky
[05:14:52] <Cork> MariusIT: something similar to that you will have to do
[05:15:02] <Cork> though you could solve it with a templating plugin
[05:15:24] <MariusIT> using twig, what plugin would you recommend?
[05:15:27] <Cork> some ex. jqote2
[05:15:55] <Cork> MariusIT: if you already use underscore you can use it's templating system
[05:16:05] <MariusIT> yea, i do
[05:22:09] <aquery> I tried with $("#location").on("keyup",function(){....} );  now it works for keyboard, but still if a user clicks on the list, it would never capture.
[05:24:25] <jugglinmike> aquery: give the handler function a name
[05:24:36] <jugglinmike> then you can bind it to different events
[05:25:15] <jugglinmike> var myHandler = function() {}; $("#location").on("keyup", myHandler); $(".some-other-selector").on("click", myHandler);
[05:25:21] <jugglinmike> aquery: ^
[05:26:23] <aquery> jugglinmike: the list that comes is populated by jquery autocomplete, so I have no idea how to capture the list item
[05:26:41] <jugglinmike> aquery: you'll use event delegation
[05:26:58] <jugglinmike> so if the autocomplete is generating "li" elements
[05:27:05] <jugglinmike> you would write
[05:27:18] <jugglinmike> $("#autocomplete").on("click", "li", myHandler);
[05:31:42] <sarahm> I'm sorry but im getting confused with ajax, do i have the right to do that : http://bpaste.net/show/rXax35FczpMez6WdtF91/
[05:39:15] <Cork> sarahm: well if you want the return value back in the ajax success callback then yes
[05:40:45] <Cork> sarahm: what we talked about was to do something like ajax_call(url, function(data) { var xml =  $(data); xml.xpath })
[05:41:09] <sarahm> Cork:  yeah i didn't pay attention for the fact that the return goes into the ajax succes callback
[05:42:05] <r1card> I use .delegate and I get this "Object {the handler here} has no method match()"
[05:42:09] <r1card> Ideas why is that/
[05:42:12] <Cork> sarahm: alternatively you can do something like function ajax_call(url) { var callback = $.Callback(); $.ajax(); return callback; }
[05:42:29] <Cork> and then do ajax_callback(url).add(function(data) {});
[05:42:44] <Cork> r1card: code please
[05:42:54] <Cork> jsfiddle.net <--
[05:45:26] <r1card> Cork, figured it out, I didn't specify the damn event name!
[05:45:31] <r1card> Cork, thanks for offering help!
[05:46:06] <r1card> Cork, just to be sure, .delegate and .bind are sort of deprecated in favor of .on, right/
[05:46:23] <slartsa_> it's redicilously hard to have a <video> with non-predefined size to fill its parent while maintaining aspect ratio and center vertically
[05:46:34] <Cork> r1card: not relly
[05:46:59] <Cork> r1card: there is no reason to remove bind and delegate, there is only one line of code for each
[05:47:08] <sarahm> Cork: i don't really get the second option, where do i specifiy my success function
[05:47:27] <Cork> sarahm: the add after the function call
[05:47:33] <r1card> Cork, sure.
[05:47:35] <Cork> then you do callback.fire(data);
[05:47:45] <r1card> Cork, but on() is kind of the latest thing, I guess right?
[05:48:08] <Cork> r1card: well yes it was added later, and it is a combination of the old two functions
[05:48:08] <sarahm> Cork : i'll try to make it work that way, thank you
[05:48:09] <r1card> I realize functionally it's not a big deal, but I mean in terms of spec/recommendation
[05:48:14] <r1card> Cork, thanks!
[05:48:20] <Cork> but there is nothing saying you should use it instead
[05:48:23] <Cork> it dosen't really matter
[05:48:32] <r1card> Cork, yup, ok :)
[05:48:48] <Cork> r1card: no recommendation, as neither is depricated
[05:50:42] <daslicht> this .data drives me craZy grr

[05:52:06] <lemonsparrow> can anyone help me with this requirement ? http://pastebin.com/tHWr52u5
[05:54:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/tHWr52u5
[05:57:40] <krawchyk> lemonsparrow: what is this for?
[05:59:11] <xec> lemonsparrow: what code have you tried so far?
[06:00:40] <lemonsparrow> xec: nothing
[06:00:46] <lemonsparrow> xec: I dont know to do it
[06:00:54] <daslicht> is using lightbox a good idea ? or is therer something better ?
[06:01:07] <jp-> lemonsparrow, quick and dirty: http://jsfiddle.net/Kvjpt/
[06:01:50] <jp-> ignore the .change() on the select, forgot to remove it, had a test in there alert'ing the option values.
[06:03:50] <lemonsparrow> jp-: thank you :)
[06:03:54] <xec> he also wanted it the other way around (the object values as option value, as opposed to the key)
[06:04:27] <jp-> well it's easy enough to switch it around.
[06:04:31] <xec> also, $.each() is good for looping through object properties
[06:06:59] <lemonsparrow> xec: modify it here please http://jsfiddle.net/Kvjpt/
[06:07:44] <xec> lemonsparrow: read the docs, its really basic
[06:07:50] <xec> lemonsparrow: see the last example at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[06:08:15] <Syrit> guys, can any one give me any tips on this please ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718880/generate-check-boxes-based-on-drop-down-selection ?
[06:09:24] <someone235> Hi, is this possible to use jQuery sparklines with two graphs at the same chart?
[06:10:48] <xec> Syrit: the if (!state == "") looks funky
[06:11:08] <xec> Syrit: you're first turning state into a bool, negating it, and then comparing it to an empty string
[06:11:13] <lemonsparrow> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/Kvjpt/1/
[06:11:26] <xec> Syrit: you probably want if (state !== "")
[06:11:35] <Syrit> oh, yes right xec ! thanks
[06:12:17] <xec> Syrit: and the var state = ... line could be simply: var state = this.value;
[06:13:00] <Syrit> oh, i see
[06:13:29] <xec> seeing as "this" will be the select element, and the value property on it will reflect the currently selected options value
[06:13:49] <Syrit> i understand
[06:14:07] <slartsa_> fitvids.js doesn't seem to have a fill-option
[06:18:06] <Syrit> thank you xec , any tips about rendering the checkboxes ?
[06:18:53] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/Kvjpt/3/
[06:18:59] <xec> Syrit: you can use $("<input>") to create a new element, and .attr() to set attributes, then .appendTo() to put it somewhere
[06:19:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[06:19:45] <Syrit> i will try that, thanks xec
[06:19:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: or if you don't need to validate the input content, you could save quite a bit of time by useing html instead
[06:20:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmm
[06:20:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: not too much of entries in object array so it's ok
[06:20:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/Kvjpt/4/
[06:20:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya, it doesn't matter for small sets
[06:21:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[06:21:32] <Cork> if you go up to a few hundred or similar it starts to matter though
[06:21:47] <Cork> not appending in a loop is more important though
[06:21:56] <Cork> as that triggers reflow in the browser
[06:22:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right
[06:26:48] <tkrugg> hoi jquery people
[06:26:52] <tkrugg> I have a small problem I wish you can help
[06:27:27] <kaldrenon> Quick question: I often end up using $(foo).find('.bar').length > 0 as the conditional in an if statement. I regularly forget to add the '.length > 0' part because I subconsciously expect find() to return false if it finds nothing. Is there either a better way to do a conditional on the presence/absence of a selector, or a function which does return true/false for the search?
[06:27:57] <xec> Syrit: just curious, what exactly does "data" contain in the ajax callback?
[06:28:27] <tkrugg> ok this is clearely working like  souk
[06:28:59] <Syrit> actually, i'm not sure if it's the right way xec , i was following some examples, and the data contains some json
[06:29:19] <Syrit> Object {success: "true", message: "hello", count: Array[1]}  xec
[06:30:08] <Syrit> i am really stuck xec , it's my very first time doing this, and i spent all the day searching, but no progress
[06:30:27] <Syrit> i am looking for similar example, to be able to do my "steps" logically, and start implementing them
[06:53:17] <DRSK> $(".selector").something( object, start: function(){} ); <-- how can I use an object + do something eelse?
[06:54:06] <DRSK> the object is filled with settings I'm sending to jQuery, but I need to add a start: thingy, but I don't know how to use both. Otherwise I will have to do settingName: object.settingName, for each setting and there are lots.
[06:54:46] <Cork> DRSK: 1. you can take the option as a member of the object you send it; 2. you can send the object as a separate argument; 3. you can merge your additional things into the object
[06:55:14] <Cork> DRSK: $.extend(object, { start: function() {} })
[06:55:24] <DRSK> Cork » 2, how do I do that?
[06:55:39] <DRSK> tried; .something( myObject, { start… } );
[06:55:58] <Cork> DRSK: something: function(object1, settings) {};
[06:56:13] <Cork> or rather $.fn.something = function(object, settings)
[06:56:50] <DRSK> so settings could be { start: function()  { do stuff } ?
[06:56:59] <Cork> yes
[06:57:19] <Cork> DRSK: as long as the function expects two objects in
[06:57:29] <Cork> DRSK: you can't send this to random functions though
[06:57:39] <DRSK> Oh, hmph.. let me paste some code I don't think it does
[06:58:03] <Cork> DRSK: but it sounds like $.extend is what your looking for
[06:58:58] <DRSK> Cork » it does, I'm just a bit confused how to use it with what I've got
[06:59:25] <Cork> DRSK: do you want to override start in object
[06:59:32] <xec> Syrit: sorry was afk there a little
[06:59:34] <Cork> or just add start if it isn't in object?
[06:59:54] <DRSK> start is from the callpack 'api' and I wish to use it in this instance of the plugin
[07:00:10] <Cork> DRSK: so you want to force it?
[07:00:14] <xec> Syrit: i made this to show how you can create checkboxes, and change them depending on a select http://jsfiddle.net/kK622/1/
[07:00:49] <Cork> DRSK: .something($.extend(object, { start: function() {} })); then
[07:01:01] <DRSK> Cork » well, you might get the picture here: http://paste.pm/9j2.js
[07:01:11] <DRSK> oh right
[07:01:18] <Cork> DRSK: if you want to keep object identical to how it was before do .something($.extend({}, object, { start: function() {} }));
[07:01:34] <xec> Syrit: i'm assuming you get an array of data you can loop for creating the checkboxes
[07:02:03] <alexfu> each time you execute a $([selector]), jquery loops through the DOM to find that element?
[07:03:07] <xec> alexfu: correct
[07:03:54] <DRSK> Cork » the former was exactly what I wanted to do, thanks a lot!
[07:04:05] <xec> alexfu: it's slightly more complex, but basically yes. in modern browsers most selectors will be passed to document.querySelectorAll() which does the job
[07:04:47] <alexfu> xec, is there a way to use the selector once and sort of chain a list of methods?
[07:05:17] <alexfu> xec, you know, aside from storing the object in a var
[07:05:33] <xec> alexfu: absolutely, it's very common in jquery, and why most methods return a jquery collection
[07:06:29] <xec> alexfu: do you have a specific thing you're trying to achieve?
[07:07:05] <alexfu> xec, i want to modify width, height and a the css property top
[07:08:10] <xec> alexfu: you don't need to chain, you can do all those with a single .css() call, like $(selector).css({ top: 5, width: 500, height: 200})
[07:08:27] <alexfu> xec, ah oh
[07:08:50] <xec> or, you can change "css" with "animate" to animate the values
[07:10:20] <Mr_Mull> hey all, anyone any good helping with a jfile error? D;
[07:10:48] <Mr_Mull> for k2
[07:10:57] <Mr_Mull> on joomlas shit
[07:11:07] <xec> alexfu: http://jsfiddle.net/P4aC2/
[07:11:30] <Mr_Mull> lol
[07:12:05] <xec> what's a "jfile"? and "k2"? and "joomlas shit"?
[07:12:16] <Mr_Mull> lol
[07:12:57] <slax0r> and instead of asking if anyone can help with a "problem" just ask the damn question directly
[07:13:25] <Mr_Mull> fien
[07:13:29] <Mr_Mull>  JFILE: :READ: UNABLE TO OPEN FILE: /COMPONENTS/COM_K2/JS/K2.JS?V2.6.7&SITEPATH=/
[07:13:30] <Mr_Mull> ^
[07:13:46] <alexfu> xec, thanks
[07:13:58] <Mr_Mull> dafuq lol
[07:16:24] <Mr_Mull> slax0r ; can you fix that?
[07:18:34] <xec> Mr_Mull: you haven't actually asked a question yet ;)
[07:18:56] <xec> that said, it's unlikely anyone in here will help you with anything except jquery
[07:19:56] <DRSK> what might cause fadeIn() to flicker in iPad?
[07:20:31] <DRSK> it does what it is supposed to do, but in the very end of the animation it's like it goes from 0 opacity to 1 in less than .1 seconds hence causing a flicker to occur which is incredibly annoying..
[07:20:46] <DRSK> also tried animating the opacity, same flicker occurs.
[07:22:04] <jedimind> DRSK what version of jquery?
[07:22:23] <Mr_Mull> true that xec, was worth a try
[07:22:25] <DRSK> jedimind » Excellent question, I believe it's 1,9,1 but I'll check real quick
[07:22:31] <Mr_Mull> joomla lads are idle
[07:22:43] <Syrit> i am reading what you sent xec , thank you so much ! , and sorry i was away as well .
[07:22:59] <DRSK> jedimind » um sorry it's 1.10.2
[07:23:16] <jedimind> DRSK try using 2.* instead
[07:23:27] <jedimind> DRSK 2.* eliminates js-based animations and leverages more css3 transforms
[07:23:32] <jedimind> which should be smoother on the ipad
[07:23:40] <DRSK> Oh, good point. I'll try that!
[07:24:25] <Syrit> inside the .each, i assume that i can use, this.name/ this.id right ? xec ?
[07:24:32] <xec> Syrit: correct
[07:24:40] <Syrit> great ! great !
[07:24:45] <xec> Syrit: if the array contains objects, that is
[07:24:51] <Syrit> yes !
[07:25:46] <Syrit> one more thing, while searching, i found some articles that uses .ajax method, an supply url, and then uses ajax:success etc... what do you recommend ? using this? or there is a better way xec ?
[07:26:33] <xec> Syrit: $.getJSON is just an alias for $.ajax that sets the correct type and header for json
[07:26:54] <Syrit> oh, i see
[07:27:16] <coldhead> abjorn: the fuck are you
[07:27:41] <xec> that was random
[07:28:28] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:28:43] <gnarf> abjorn: poke
[07:28:43] <DRSK> jedimind » I'm running 2.0.3 at the moment although the same flicker happens. Going to try fadeIn again instead of animating the opacity
[07:30:07] <DRSK> jedimind » oh well, no luck there either. The animation is flawless, it's just that the last "frame" bugs out.
[07:31:35] <gnarf> coldhead: he said the back of the room
[07:31:53] <DRSK> jedimind » okay so I believe I know what's causing the flicker. The element wrapper I'm animating has rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6). That is what's bugging out. It fades to .6, then goes to 1, then back to .6 real quick. Setting the background to .. white doesn't show the flicker.
[07:33:20] <Syrit> thank you so much xec
[07:33:43] <coldhead> thx gnarf
[07:34:11] <Ose> can anyone tell me why the .getJSON on https://github.com/mathiasose/ma.thiaso.se/blob/angularJS/js/PageControl.js (line 53) gives me a "[Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012" nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)" location: "http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js Line: 8706"]"
[07:34:46] <Ose> is it because i'm testing locally and not on a webserver?
[07:34:52] <DRSK> jedimind » tried making it with a 1x1 px white png instead, flicker occurs again - clueless what's going on. Oh well :/
[07:35:32] <daslicht> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/6EUJT/  looks like I d rather go this way, enough pain for today :)
[07:36:07] <gswain> hey guys I'm trying to work on simple dependent drop down which is not being so simple for me :-) if someone could take a quick look i would really appreciate it. http://pastebin.com/0vG7QDgg
[07:37:39] <gnarf> coldhead no problem - it's your first day at a jQuery Conference after all ;)
[07:38:03] <coldhead> i'm learning what jquery is right now
[07:38:11] <coldhead> it seems to be a way to force "layouts"
[07:38:19] <coldhead> in your internet "web browser"
[07:40:46] <p3lim> If I have an input, which I'm using in js, and I want to get it's sibling label (rather, the connected label)
[07:40:54] <p3lim> What do I need to get that?
[07:41:17] <alexfu> is $.get compatible w/ IE7?
[07:41:27] <gnarf> p3lim if you know the pattern of the DOM and you could do something like $(this).closest('.container').find('label')
[07:41:29] <erry> hmf, i'm dong $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: '/json/user/messages/unread' });
[07:41:59] <erry> which doesn't record anything in chrome network panel or server-side but this does: $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: '/json/user/messages/unread?' });
[07:42:48] <p3lim> gnarf: Perfect, thanks
[07:42:53] <coldhead> erry: this sounds crazy but try restarting the browser
[07:43:17] <gnarf> erry seems like /json/user/messages/unread might be passing a cache header that has it cached in the browser?
[07:43:32] <coldhead> alt. cache: false
[07:43:33] <gnarf> you can try , "cache: false" to have it add a cache busting key to the URL
[07:43:46] <gnarf> it basically does ?_=1235125251
[07:44:17] <gswain> im trying to get when someone selects a state and their current education level, the value of education level and the value of the state selected goes to the server in a url like this: 
[07:44:17] <gswain> http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/AL so far it only gets http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/
[07:44:37] <gswain> can someone have a look http://pastebin.com/0vG7QDgg
[07:44:56] <erry> oh it was the cache thing thanks
[07:46:37] <BillCriswell> I thought there was about to be a rumble.
[07:52:57] <saml> hello
[07:53:09] <saml> what's a good file upload plugin via ajax and FormData?
[07:53:40] <crash1hd> Does anyone know of a jQuery feature that locks gridview first column and header but still allows the scroll of the content
[07:57:35] <gianiaz> hi, how I can unbind 'click' on .plcsingle binded with this: $(document).on('click', '.plcsingle', function(e) {
[07:58:01] <NoiseEee> gianiaz: .off!
[07:58:30] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[07:58:41] <gianiaz> $('.plcsingle').off();
[07:58:48] <gianiaz> doesn't work
[07:59:00] <NoiseEee> nor should it
[07:59:04] <jnewt> $('#myTable').on('click','tr',function(e){});  is what i have now.  i am wanting to change  to .dblclick, but it doesn't run correctly.  is it because of the 'tr' part?  how to fix?
[07:59:05] <gianiaz> mmm
[07:59:23] <gianiaz> I have to debug better then, maybe the problem is in another part of the code
[07:59:41] <NoiseEee> gianiaz: hint: use the same element you used when you attached the handler
[08:00:02] <jnewt> it seems that $(this) is different when using dblclick
[08:00:15] <gianiaz> I've tried $('.plcsingle'), but I've binded with document
[08:00:55] <JonathanDavis> Any idea how to use jQuery.support to detect the ability for printing iframes?
[08:00:57] <gianiaz> NoiseEee, thank you
[08:01:03] <NoiseEee> gianiaz: np
[08:01:04] <gianiaz> it was the case :-)
[08:01:23] <JonathanDavis> I don't see any property for it in the API docs
[08:01:32] <gswain> im trying to get when someone selects a state and their current education level, the value of education level and the value of the state selected goes to the server in a url like this: http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/AL only all I can get is http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/ my state value is not getting put in can someone have a look? http://pastebin.com/0vG7QDgg
[08:02:30] <jnewt> nm, got it
[08:10:29] <gswain> im trying to get when someone selects a state and their current education level, the value of education level and the value of the state selected goes to the server in a url like this: http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/AL only all I can get is http://stage.domain.us/get-degrees-ajax/1/ my state value is not getting put in can someone have a look? http://pastebin.com/0vG7QDgg
[08:10:50] <gswain> I'm willing to pay for the help if you have a paypal
[08:14:48] <rgr> any plugin/snippet for positioning a jquery collection relative to the first ie stagger a bunch of divs with next one overlapping previous like a fanned out deck of cards?
[08:21:45] <BillCriswell> gswain: So, basically, you just want to submit url.com/select_value_1/select_value_2 whenever either of those selects change?
[08:22:12] <gswain> i think only when ed level changes
[08:22:30] <gswain> unless you think there is something wrong with that approach
[08:22:47] <gswain> not looking to get hairy and complex - just minimum viable
[08:22:48] <BillCriswell> Are they able to go back anc change the state?
[08:22:53] <gswain> yea
[08:23:17] <BillCriswell> ok, so you'd need to see if either changes.
[08:23:32] <gswain> ok
[08:23:35] <Syrit> xec, still up for some more tips :P
[08:24:12] <gswain> BillCrisswell can i pm you?
[08:24:17] <xec> i'm awake!
[08:24:19] <xec> whats up
[08:25:07] <BillCriswell> Sure thing.
[08:25:13] <BillCriswell> I'm writing you up a demo real quick though.
[08:25:38] <Syrit> xec, the data is the success handler for the ajax request right ? it's returning objects
[08:26:39] <gswain> cool I appreciate it
[08:26:57] <Syrit> and if i do $each(data) it's not giving the right output , it's giving only one checkbox with [object Object] as label !
[08:33:44] <xec> Syrit: ok, what does the object look like?
[08:33:56] <xec> Syrit: can you pastebin the return data?
[08:34:06] <xec> as in, the json string
[08:34:20] <NoiseEee> Syrit: look at the xhr response in the debugger. you;ll see how its structured, probably as a collection of objects
[08:35:02] <SalientKnight> hey all ... can anyone help me figure out how to access the child div in this code segment? http://pastebin.com/vB1q1L0t
[08:35:46] <NoiseEee> SalientKnight: well think about it.  we know its going to be in the table with a class Header right
[08:35:54] <NoiseEee> so start there.
[08:36:10] <xec> SalientKnight: ".Header h4 + div" ?
[08:36:18] <Rob99> where is the best place to learn jquery I am just starting out and dont want to bug people all the time
[08:36:20] <SalientKnight> NoiseEee, I just want to access the one div, not all of them
[08:36:26] <BillCriswell> SalientKnight: $('.OrderDetailRightColumnCentered > div') ?
[08:36:30] <NoiseEee> i only see one div SalientKnight.
[08:36:43] <Syrit> it looks like this xex http://pastebin.com/WxF33quX
[08:36:43] <BillCriswell> Haha what I was about to say.
[08:37:06] <SalientKnight> There is one on the very bottom that I need to access
[08:37:25] <NoiseEee> SalientKnight: so whats the issue? will there be multiple tables with the class Header?
[08:37:36] <SalientKnight> probably
[08:37:41] <xec> SalientKnight: your array is inside count?
[08:37:50] <xec> sorry, that was for you Syrit
[08:37:54] <BillCriswell> Are you guys seeing code I'm not?
[08:37:56] <BillCriswell> Oh, ok ahah.
[08:37:57] <NoiseEee> so which div do you want? just the first in the first table? or what SalientKnight?  be more specific in your question.
[08:38:07] <xec> Syrit: if so, try $.each(data.count, func...)
[08:38:10] <SalientKnight> I want the second in the first table
[08:38:15] <Syrit> i will try that xec
[08:38:28] <xec> ?each @ Syrit
[08:38:29] <NoiseEee> SalientKnight: you mean the first in the first table.  there's only one div in that table.
[08:38:38] <JonathanDavis> Any hints on a jQuery.support property that detects the ability to print frames/iframes?
[08:38:45] <BillCriswell> SalientKnight: Terrible HTML example provided
[08:38:48] <SalientKnight> you're right sorry
[08:38:49] <xec> is there a new bot syntax for the api?
[08:38:51] <Syrit> i will try data.count
[08:39:00] <xec> ?jquery each
[08:39:14] <xec> or is he just not here perhaps :(
[08:39:28] <SalientKnight> BillCriswell, sorry... the full HTML is worse... its being created by some MS library and I want to stragle the guy who cobbled this together...
[08:39:40] <NoiseEee> SalientKnight: so already you know a bit.  you want the first table with the class Header, then you want the first div in that table.
[08:39:55] <SalientKnight> thanks NoiseEee
[08:40:18] <NoiseEee> so try a selector and let us know if it doesn't work / needs correcting
[08:41:28] <james_woods> For those interested in catching the stuff i was trying to catch (bootstrap dropdown / select closes) this worked for me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12479858/twitter-bootstrap-call-a-js-function-when-a-dropdown-is-closed
[08:45:53] <Syrit> it's working finaly xec, thank you so much
[08:46:09] <Syrit> xec, can you please answer your private message i sent to you ?
[08:50:31] <SalientKnight> NoiseEee, even this $("table .header").css("border", "13px solid red"); is not working
[08:51:12] <NoiseEee> SalientKnight: wasn't the class Header, not header?
[08:51:33] <SalientKnight> hangs his head in shame
[08:51:59] <SalientKnight> thanks
[08:52:08] <NoiseEee> np
[08:52:59] <SalientKnight> but that still didn't work
[08:55:22] <NoiseEee> table.header
[08:56:49] <linagee_> (ie8 + json + jquery) are driving me crazy. :(
[08:58:16] <linagee_> right now I have my json response sending out whatever the browser can handle. (using $ENV{HTTP_ACCEPT} in perl.) so if it can accept application/json, I use that. if not, I send it text/json. (If you always send application/json like the RFC says, ie8 says "would you like to download a file?")
[08:58:48] <NoiseEee> linagee_: i don't experience that at all.
[08:58:49] <linagee_> I have jquery's .ajax in "dataType:json" mode. but it doesn't seem to want to parse things correctly?
[08:58:56] <linagee_> (at all)
[08:59:31] <linagee_> the simple solution would be to force all users of the site to upgrade their browsers
[08:59:45] <linagee_> NoiseEee: :(
[09:02:57] <NoiseEee> linagee_: Try using jQuery.parseJSON when you get the data back.
[09:05:38] <linagee_> I got it not to barf at least... read headers, then give it dataType: 'text' or dataType: 'json' in the jquery.ajax
[09:06:29] <linagee_> I'm still not sure if I can access returned object in the success function (or whatever its called now post-1.8)
[09:06:45] <NoiseEee> linagee_: Try using jQuery.parseJSON when you get the data back.
[09:06:49] <linagee_> done
[09:07:01] <linagee_> (its now called done)
[09:07:28] <NoiseEee> so done = jQuery.parseJSON(data); console.log(done)
[09:08:15] <linagee_> I still use success though because jquery forms plugin hands almost an entire .ajax through, but the developer hasn't done succes->done yet
[09:08:49] <NoiseEee> pastebin your XHR
[09:09:27] <linagee_> NoiseEee: I soooo wish I could console.log the data object sent back. grrrr @ ie8
[09:09:49] <linagee_> (I've tried firebug lite but its kinda crappy and doesn't seem to see the console.log or something?)
[09:10:03] <linagee_> (no native firebug for ie8)
[09:10:40] <NoiseEee> !fixingthesejquery
[09:10:55] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 give that a read, linagee_
[09:11:33] <linagee_> NoiseEee: is it like... find ie8 users and force them to upgrade their browsers? ahahahaha.
[09:11:37] <linagee_> :-/
[09:13:24] <linagee_> hrm... fiddler. /me runs off to try it
[09:13:52] <linagee_> (found that from your slideshow. thanks!)
[09:15:15] <NoiseEee> thank ajpiano! its his great resource.
[09:22:33] <raj> shoky?
[09:22:59] <toxz> hi! i have 2 versions of jquery in no conflict mode v1.2.6 + 1.10.2. is it possible with v1.10.2 to trigger the bound change events from the v1.2.6 object? i can't find a way :-(
[09:26:25] <alexfu> If I append elements to a div, I would expect those elements to show up when I view the source. In IE7, my div is completely empty but when i do $('#mydiv').children().length i get a non-zero number
[09:26:45] <NoiseEee> alexfu: no, 'view source' is a static view of source at page load
[09:26:52] <NoiseEee> alexfu: you use the console.
[09:27:07] <NoiseEee> or whatever IE provides to view the DOM in real-time view
[09:27:16] <shoky> oi raj
[09:27:30] <hooligan132> hey all :)
[09:27:38] <hooligan132> i have some good news for one and all
[09:27:52] <alexfu> NoiseEee, damn.  thanks
[09:28:00] <toxz> hooligans always have good news
[09:28:45] <hooligan132> I have semi solved the problem with jPlayer and the shoutcast streaming bug that I know affects chrome specifically..
[09:29:05] <hooligan132> so the world can have reliable jplayer/html5/shoutcast streaming lub
[09:29:27] <hooligan132> http://www.unitystreams.com/zen-player/play2.html
[09:29:40] <hooligan132> do I get a cookie or what ;D
[09:29:54] <abjorn> coldhead: follow your heart
[09:31:06] <hooligan132> fing orical so tight with her cookies for me
[09:31:17] <hooligan132> I'll smash her kitchen up with a medium hammer
[09:31:46] <abjorn> what.
[09:32:33] <toxz> hooligan132 - do it now
[09:33:56] * hooligan132 cuts off her electrical supply to the stove
[09:34:15] <abjorn> this hooliganism
[09:35:47] <linagee_> NoiseEee: do you know how I can get the xhr to display something meaningful? I push it to an alert and its just like: [Object]
[09:35:59] <linagee_> I would console.log, but this is ie8. ack
[09:36:03] <NoiseEee> you should not be debugging with alert
[09:36:13] <NoiseEee> doesn't ie8 have a console equiv? via a plugin in
[09:36:21] <abjorn> via plugin ya
[09:36:27] <abjorn> i forget the name of it
[09:36:32] <linagee_> fiddler?
[09:36:35] <abjorn> either way though you're gonna get [Object]
[09:36:49] <abjorn> you need to output the exact data from the xhr that you're interested in
[09:37:10] <profElm> Hey guys, I had a question about jquery. I posted my question here: http://jsfiddle.net/5TFMC/
[09:37:22] <tsmith> Hi. what is the best way to cause a JQuery event to fire when someone changes something in the URL, like a ?parameter?
[09:38:04] <linagee_> tsmith: like after the #? like angularjs does?
[09:38:32] <NoiseEee> tsmith: onhashchange event
[09:38:33] <abjorn> profElm: $('.one').hide().siblings('.two').show(); but I don't see why that would be any better than just doing it on two lines like you are
[09:39:07] <profElm> I see.. I didn't know if using the $ selector twice would impact performance or not.
[09:40:29] <abjorn> you could always try out which is slower with jsperf.net
[09:40:37] <abjorn> I don't think it would end up being any different
[09:41:13] <abjorn> Unless you're doing that *a lot* though (in which case you should cache those two elements anyways) it wouldn't matter anyways
[09:41:34] <tsmith> NoiseEee: thank you very very much, that's exactly what i needed to know ;)
[09:41:49] <NoiseEee> yw tsmith
[09:42:06] <profElm> Thanks for the help abjorn !
[09:43:53] <abjorn> no probz
[09:46:21] <profElm> Inteseresting abjorn. I found this: http://jsperf.com/hideshowtest
[09:47:21] <abjorn> yeah, it probably shouldn't matter
[09:51:42] <mattalexx> I have an easy selector question: How can I retrieve all TRs where the second TD's trimmed contents matches "KeyString"?
[09:52:11] <mattalexx> Where the &nbsp;s get trimmed as will
[09:52:14] <mattalexx> *well
[09:52:51] <dashlikedame> hey do you guys know of any small good web development companies taking new projects? just 1 or 2 recommendations plz
[09:53:00] <dashlikedame> that do both front end and backend
[09:53:27] <hooligan132> http://www.unitystreams.com/zen-player/play2.html <-- playing first time from chrome yes/no ?
[09:53:53] <jop008> how to <td onclick='oprice_calendar.go2booking( true,120752)' id = 'christianname_120752' style='text-align:center;vertical-align: middle;'>Ophof</td>  remove string Ophof from this td tag?
[09:54:07] <dashlikedame> msg me if anything
[10:03:43] <jop008> if my element has an innerhtml of xx how to make it blank?
[10:03:52] <jop008> the jquery element is oel
[10:04:04] <raj> how does facebook autoplay youtube videos?
[10:04:04] <jop008> oel.html () ?
[10:04:58] <NoiseEee> ('')
[10:05:50] <NoiseEee> or jQuery.empty()
[10:22:08] <raj> how does facebook autoplay youtube videos?
[10:22:40] <doug65536> raj: you put &autostart=1 at the end of the url iirc
[10:23:01] <doug65536> you are using iframe embed?
[10:23:22] <doug65536> raj: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters
[10:23:32] <doug65536> it's autoplay, not autostart
[10:23:51] <raj> doug65536, yes
[10:24:03] <raj> but facebook doesn't have autostart
[10:24:20] <doug65536> they probably use the js api
[10:24:25] <doug65536> just read the link I posted
[10:24:54] <doug65536> raj: for example: <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390"
[10:24:54] <doug65536>   src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M7lc1UVf-VE?autoplay=1&origin=http://example.com"
[10:24:54] <doug65536>   frameborder="0"/>
[10:25:15] <raj> doug65536, yes, I've seen that
[10:25:23] <doug65536> raj: then why are you asking
[10:25:26] <raj> but facebook doesn't have that, so I was wondering how they were accomplishing it
[10:25:33] <doug65536> who cares how they do it
[10:26:03] <doug65536> bring up your debugger and figure it out if you really care
[10:26:17] <doug65536> they probably use the postMessage API
[10:26:29] <raj> what makes you say that?
[10:27:07] <doug65536> because I've embedded youtube and vimeo videos before and had requirements for smartly pausing and resuming videos
[10:27:36] <doug65536> I had to pause/resume them on the fly from js in a slider
[10:27:49] <doug65536> when you go to another slide it magically paused the video if you played it
[10:28:37] <doug65536> you can't do that with a get parameter. I used their js api
[10:28:41] <doug65536> read the link I posted
[10:28:41] <raj> I do'nt see postmessage api here https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference
[10:28:58] <jop008> is there a javascript parser available? I want to extract all strings from my code and let it refer to a database
[10:29:10] <jop008> I can do it by dom parsing also
[10:29:42] <doug65536> raj: I found it in < 5 seconds
[10:29:52] <doug65536> raj: Enabling the JavaScript API for an embedded player
[10:30:20] <doug65536> raj: https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_player_demo
[10:30:24] <raj> that's "postmessage api"?
[10:30:48] <doug65536> raj: I call it the "postmessage" api because that is how it works
[10:31:26] <doug65536> raj: https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference
[10:32:09] <raj> I see
[10:32:25] <Stephen> So, in light of iptables being awful to work with, I built a script to tunnel connections from webserver:randomport to internalserver:specificport
[10:32:34] <raj> so js api is better and more robust?
[10:32:42] <Stephen> Each time a tunnel is built a new instance of node is launched
[10:32:59] <doug65536> raj: if all you want is to immediately start playing, just put autoplay=1 in the url
[10:33:11] <doug65536> more code isn't "better"
[10:33:17] <doug65536> less code is better
[10:33:21] <raj> true
[10:33:24] <Stephen> Im curious if anyone can speak to the performance implications of this, and how you might have done it otherwise if not this way
[10:33:33] <raj> just thinking about down the line, but yes, autostart=1 is better for now
[10:33:56] <doug65536> if you ever need to dynamically manipulate the player, keep the api thing in mind
[10:34:14] <raj> k
[10:34:58] <doug65536> Stephen: a new instance?
[10:35:02] <obert> css issue: do you know why a datepicker's jquery ui widget shoud stay under some other layers, instead get a correct z-index?
[10:35:36] <doug65536> Stephen: doing it natively is probably 100x or 1000x more efficient
[10:36:03] <Stephen> natively?
[10:36:12] <doug65536> Stephen: if you don't have tight latency requirements, or expect a low connection count, that way is ok
[10:36:30] <doug65536> Stephen: using the kernel - iptables
[10:36:41] <Stephen> doug65536: I'm tunnelling VNC connections basicalyl
[10:36:48] <Stephen> VNC over websockets
[10:37:00] <doug65536> Stephen: why a new instance? why not just use one node for every connection
[10:37:06] <doug65536> one instance
[10:37:21] <Stephen> My main problem with iptables was the lack of ability to instantly shut down a connection
[10:37:48] <jop008> So nobody a method to extract the strings of a web page and replace it with a function. So all the text content comes from a database.
[10:38:13] <Stephen> My thought was I didn't want an error in one connection taking down every connection
[10:38:17] <Stephen> Thus separate instances
[10:38:32] <doug65536> Stephen:  an error? that's a pretty lame reason
[10:38:37] <doug65536> what do you mean "error"
[10:39:01] <Stephen> I know proper error handling could take care of it, but we're also talking about different business users connecting to different VNC servers
[10:39:16] <Stephen> Not sharing their memory space just seemed prudent
[10:39:25] <doug65536> Stephen: you already know having tons of processes is bad for performance
[10:39:44] <Stephen> Yeah, but it's just one process per tunnel
[10:40:11] <doug65536> your cpu will spend a lot of time in context switch. what's the point of node if you are just going to ruin perf with context switches. the whole point of node is reducing context switching
[10:40:42] <doug65536> it's how node makes up for slow javascript execution: not blocking on locks and context switching
[10:40:53] <CrysAk> Question : is it possible to have a constantyl updating page using ajax to get the latest infor from a database table useing dealys and such or would the page eventually time out?
[10:40:54] <Stephen> For some reason I'm worried that multiple streams in a single instance is going to run afoul memory constraints or the event loop causing lag
[10:40:59] <Stephen> Could be completely unfounded
[10:41:23] <doug65536> Stephen: total bs imho. all those problems will occur even worse with multiple processes
[10:41:30] <NoiseEee> CrysAk: look into long polling, or modern solution, Socket.IO
[10:41:37] <Stephen> Hmm
[10:41:37] <CrysAk> NoiseEee,  thanks
[10:41:45] <Stephen> This convo was meant for #Node.js
[10:41:46] <Stephen> My bad
[10:42:06] <Stephen> Feel free to join me there, your advice is valid
[11:12:06] <d0den> I would say that about 70% of the time I come here for help and create a fiddle to point out my problem, I end up seeing my mistake and not needing help at all
[11:12:17] <d0den> as in, before I ask the question
[11:13:17] <boytoy_> d0den: yeah thats one of the beauties of fiddles :P
[11:14:10] <d0den> I can see that, but it's also oddly frustrating :P
[11:14:16] <d0den> makes me feel like a real dumdu
[11:14:22] <ph88_> improves your skill
[11:14:26] <ph88_> make you proud
[11:17:43] <boytoy_> d0den: i dont see the problem :)
[11:20:28] <xec_> d0den: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[11:23:15] <Reck> I want to learn something different from JQuery. Backbone or Angular, what do you think?
[11:23:34] <Kambfhase> learn JavaScript.
[11:26:02] <goldr046> you would probably still use jquery with backbone or angular
[11:27:26] <d0den> in the return line of a function that truens many variables, is there an easy way to say "return only those variables with a value"?
[11:27:34] <ph88_> Reck: EmberJS or backbone-marionette
[11:27:39] <d0den> a function that returns many variables*
[11:28:15] <petey> can anyone help me with some opening/closing tabs written in jquery using show/hide?
[11:28:55] <petey> i can get the tabs to open, but hiding them with a "close" button or hiding one when another one is clicked is a little confusing
[11:28:57] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/totalmajor/TzmXS/
[11:30:04] <p3lim> I have one button on top of another, how can I prevent the bottom one from beeing clicked when I click the top one?
[11:31:41] <Reck> ph88_: It's a though choice.... Angular is backed by Google which drags me towards that. What makes Ember great? And what is great about Marionette?
[11:32:16] <goldr046> petey: you can do this thing where you just hide all menus before showing a new one
[11:32:20] <goldr046> that's a typical way to do it
[11:32:36] <petey> so on click close, it closes all the menus
[11:32:44] <goldr046> sure
[11:32:44] <petey> on click open a new menu, close all the menu's first, then open a new one?
[11:32:53] <ph88_> Reck: Angular you have to put much data stuff in your HTML ... which i don't like. Backbone does not give enough structure / best practise for starting. Ember and marionette are just good
[11:33:22] <goldr046> yes
[11:33:58] <Reck> ph88_: Doesn't Angular put data in HTML to recognize what is going on?
[11:34:22] <goldr046> there are a lot of blogs that survey the popular frameworks
[11:35:25] <ph88_> Reck:  it does
[11:36:18] <NoiseEee> Reck: its a hard decision
[11:36:26] <NoiseEee> Reck: im also going through it, and also leaning toward Angular
[11:36:30] <Reck> ph88_: Thank you for your opinion!
[11:37:02] <ph88_> np
[11:37:40] <Reck> NoiseEee: It is really hard... Googles name on Angular just drags me to it
[11:37:48] <dkphenom> anyone know of image carousel plugin that grayscales the image not currently in primary view?
[11:37:57] <NoiseEee> well i hope you're not also getting dragged toward Dart, Reck
[11:38:04] <dkphenom> or not in view, but not in focus I should say
[11:39:25] <boytoy_> dkphenom: a real carousel plugin should let you be in charge of that
[11:40:32] <dkphenom> do you have one in mind boytoy>
[11:40:44] <boytoy_> dkphenom: theres http://swipejs.com/, http://slidesjs.com/ as well as http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com/
[11:41:10] <boytoy_> at the end of the day though i had to write my own :/
[11:42:05] <dkphenom> :/
[11:42:40] <boytoy_> dkphenom: should be fine in your case
[11:43:42] <petey> does anyone mind looking at this code? i cant figure it out
[11:43:43] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/totalmajor/TzmXS/
[11:44:18] <initself> i've got this submit validation, and the form doesn't acually submit, even though i get past all the error checking
[11:44:21] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/bwJWt/
[11:44:46] <initself> in a submit function, if it doesn't return false anywhere, shouldn't the form submit?
[11:45:10] <initself> it got all the way to: console.log('here no catch')
[11:45:49] <ph88_> petey: what's wrong with it ?
[11:47:36] <tboy> Hi guys...i'm new to jquery and i need your help...some hours back i tried creating an image slider with jquery but couldnt get it...i'm totaly confused
[11:47:37] <ph88_> initself: if it's for validation  maybe you want  .on('submit', function() {   })
[11:47:47] <xec_> initself: could you supply the html in the jsfiddle too please?
[11:48:10] <xec_> initself: it looks like it should submit to me
[11:48:22] <petey> ph88_ it right now if you click each tab, it opens, and then they all end up opening
[11:48:43] <petey> clicking close doesn't hide the tabs either
[11:48:57] <petey> so im trying to figure out how to close all the tabs first, then open the one that was clicked
[11:49:05] <petey> but putting a .hide() before the .show() doesn't get it working either
[11:49:25] <initself> I renamed the submit button to something other than name="submit" and it seems to have worked.
[11:49:45] <initself> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729330/jquery-triggersubmit-breaking
[11:50:23] <goldr046> initself: if ( $('span#attempt_errors').text() )
[11:50:27] <xec_> initself: is that your question?
[11:50:32] <xec_> on so
[11:50:57] <goldr046> that's not a valid test
[11:51:02] <goldr046> it always will be true
[11:51:11] <xec_> goldr046: it's emptied
[11:51:20] <xec_> goldr046: an empty string will be false
[11:51:54] <xec_> initself: http://jibbering.com/faq/names/
[11:52:23] <goldr046> petey: if you add a class called 'menu' to each menu, then you can hide all menus by doing $('.menu').hide()
[11:53:04] <petey> ah okay makes sense
[11:54:42] <escher> petey:  You've got another issue, though.
[11:54:52] <petey> oh :/
[11:55:00] <escher> petey:  Your "Close" button is INSIDE #menu li.[country].
[11:55:10] <escher> So, when you click close, it's firing the hide, and then immediately firing the show.
[11:55:24] <petey> yeah i was going to ask why it's firing everything
[11:55:53] <petey> i thought by just using '.close' i could target just the close button
[11:57:19] <petey> is there anyway I can get around that?
[11:58:06] <escher> There's a whole slew of ways, but my recommendation would be to either a) not nest the whole list inside the element, or b) put the "show" trigger on a span of just the link text.
[12:01:07] <petey> so remove the div with 4columns from the upper li?
[12:01:14] <mart1n> anyone here familiar with jsdom?
[12:01:15] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[12:01:17] <petey> so it's on it's own? while keeping span inside the dropdown_4columns
[12:01:44] <Bloomberg> Someone can help me to limit the events that I can to see in the month view of fullcalendar plz
[12:05:32] <abjorn> shes a super freak, super freak!
[12:06:31] <tw2113> thanks for noticing abjorn
[12:09:02] <abjorn> the music choices are...eclectic
[12:09:08] <tds5016> hi all. I am trying to empty EVERYTHING in a child node.
[12:09:21] <tds5016> .empty() doesn't appready to remove ALL children nodes.
[12:09:28] <tds5016> appear to*
[12:09:32] <tds5016> am I doing this correclty?
[12:09:44] <goldr046> no?
[12:09:48] <tds5016> or do I need to find each child and recursively empty, because if so, this kinda sucks.
[12:09:49] <tds5016> lol.
[12:09:56] <goldr046> empty() should work
[12:10:11] <tds5016> yeah. <div><childDiv><child'sChildDiv> div.empty()
[12:10:19] <tds5016> it looks to ONLY remove the div and childDiv
[12:10:23] <tds5016> not child child's div
[12:10:47] <goldr046> that doesn't make sense, really
[12:11:02] <tds5016> I'm wondering if the function that adds to the div is actually not done being run when I run empty.
[12:11:12] <NoiseEee> tds5016: jsfiddle
[12:11:15] <tds5016> hmmm....
[12:11:32] <goldr046> that's possible
[12:11:41] <p3lim> I have one button on top of another, how can I prevent the bottom one from beeing clicked when I click the top one?
[12:12:17] <goldr046> event.stopPropagation() maybe
[12:12:43] <goldr046> you have a button on top of a button?
[12:13:52] <tds5016> of course the jsfiddle works.
[12:13:53] <tds5016> lol.
[12:13:57] <Ose> doesn't .getJSON implicitly .parseJSON?
[12:14:01] <tds5016> yeah. I have a feeling the render isn't complete :-(
[12:14:03] <tds5016> I'm sorry guys.
[12:14:08] <tds5016> thanks for helping me talk through it :-)
[12:14:51] <initself> so it looks like .submit() does not send the name of the submit button along as a parameter
[12:15:03] <goldr046> you can try adding a setTimeout to your function to see if the result is different
[12:15:19] <initself> i am used to forms sending the name of the submit button a long and then using that parameter to see whether or not the form has been submitted in my backend code
[12:15:21] <goldr046> tds5016: ^
[12:15:40] <initself> can i get .submit() to send the name of the submit button?
[12:16:02] <tds5016> oooo! stopPropagation?
[12:16:04] <tds5016> how does that work?
[12:16:26] <initself> i could just use a hidden field, maybe
[12:16:34] <goldr046> initself: yes
[12:16:38] <tds5016> goldr046: that sounds amazing. lemme try that out.
[12:16:46] <tds5016> do I need to "restart" propagation?
[12:16:51] <goldr046> why do you need to do that tho
[12:17:09] <goldr046> oh, wait
[12:17:14] <tds5016> oh, actually, tht won't work.
[12:17:18] <goldr046> tds5016: i meant that message for p3lim
[12:18:05] <tds5016> goldr046: gotchya. :-) is there a way to tell a dom to "stop listening" to adds?
[12:18:08] <goldr046> if yo'ure using jquery, try moving the function into the window.load event instead
[12:18:12] <tds5016> or appends*
[12:18:18] <tds5016> until something is done running?
[12:18:25] <tds5016> or to wait until something is done running?
[12:18:34] <goldr046> well, there is, yeah
[12:18:39] <goldr046> but i dont' think that's necessary here
[12:18:54] <tds5016> goldr046: I am using backbone, and running render()
[12:19:02] <tds5016> then I'm re-rendering before the first render is complete.
[12:19:03] <goldr046> instead of putting the empty() function in document.ready, put it in window.load
[12:19:09] <tds5016> and runing empty()
[12:19:27] <tds5016> goldr046: the document and window are already loaded.
[12:19:51] <tds5016> it's the backbone render that I'm trying to stop :-/.
[12:19:52] <goldr046> you should'nt be emptying on either of those events then
[12:20:05] <goldr046> you should empty as a callback for when the data is rendered
[12:20:25] <goldr046> i don't know backbone really
[12:20:38] <tds5016> yeah, but it's not ALWAYS emptied :-/.
[12:20:44] <tds5016> only when there is a re-render happening.
[12:21:32] <goldr046> $.Deferred allows you to wait for a certain condition to be true, but i don't know if that's the right way, or if there's backbone way to do it
[12:21:36] <tds5016> this.$el.find('svg').empty();
[12:21:45] <tds5016> when I run that, I am able to empty the div.
[12:21:55] <tds5016> but when I do its parent it doesn't completely empty.
[12:22:00] <tds5016> I dunno :/.
[12:22:01] <goldr046> there must be a callback hook for when backbone re-renders
[12:22:13] <goldr046> it just doesn't seem right for you to do it this way
[12:22:25] <goldr046> backbone is supposedly in charge of keeping the UI refreshed
[12:22:46] <goldr046> you should be updating your backbone model rather than doing this
[12:22:58] <goldr046> that's just the way it seems to me, i don't really know
[12:23:28] <goldr046> anyway, gotta run good luck
[12:24:48] <tds5016> oh, I think I figued it out.
[12:25:53] <Bloomberg> someone here has worked with fullcalendar plugin?
[12:31:42] <Andrevan> I've used fullcalendar
[12:32:55] <Bloomberg> Andrevan: man I have a problem because I need to limit the events showed in the month view?
[12:33:27] <Andrevan> Bloomberg: where are the events coming from? can't you do that upstream?
[12:36:27] <Andrevan> Bloomberg: fullcalendar is a UI thing, in the model of the events class or layer, you can filter em there
[12:36:52] <Andrevan> and if you need to you can make # items a parameter to the API call
[12:37:16] <Andrevan> e.g. /events.json?n=10
[12:38:04] <Andrevan> if you don't have control of that... create another layer of js and parse the JSON, remove the items you don't want, and repackage it as a json
[12:38:08] <Andrevan> or use backbone or something
[12:38:42] <Bloomberg> Andrevan: man Internal box!
[12:39:25] <Andrevan> I understand, but you then need to abstract that internal API in javascriptland
[12:40:21] <Andrevan> fullcalendar is basically just a shiny little widget that takes a json feed and displays what you give it
[12:41:30] <Andrevan> if you really are desperate you could theoretically remove the calendar items from the DOM after the fact
[12:41:36] <Andrevan> but it's gnarly
[12:43:34] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/k9a8nUxE
[12:43:36] <Bloomberg> I have this
[12:43:59] <Bloomberg> that is the php source of my fullcalendar
[13:06:16] <petey> are there any built in left to right functions besides animate?
[13:06:23] <petey> i feel like it doesn't look that good with the text wrapping
[13:08:44] <krambiorix> hi, how can check if    $(this).find(".debet").val() is not undefined and not empty  in one check?
[13:32:16] <V8Energy> $("td[class^='fc-col']").on("mousemove", function() { console.log("test"); }); <-- any ideas why this doesn't trigger?  $("td[class^='fc-col']") returns an array of td elements
[13:34:13] <shinobi_one__> When using $.post to send an AJAX POST request, I put "json" after the success callback just like in the examples on the API documentation, yet when my server receives the request it is form encoded not application/json.
[13:34:21] <shinobi_one__> I don't mind, but I'm just trying to figure out why this is.
[13:41:23] <shoky> shinobi_one__: putting that "json" argument there changes the dataType option (of $.ajax) which is the expected response type from the server, not of the browser request
[13:42:16] <shoky> shinobi_one__: if you want to set the request content-type, you can use $.ajax's contentType option
[13:43:07] <shinobi_one__> shoky: so, is it more conventional to post using application/json content-type or form-encoded (which is generally easier to access data server side)
[13:43:39] <shoky> shinobi_one__: i'd say both are conventional nowadays
[13:46:45] <duckgoose> http://blog.haxed.net/Simple_JavaScript_data_encryption yw
[13:47:36] <Bloomberg> shoky: Man can do you help me to hide more than 4 events in the same day in fullcalendar plugin?
[13:48:00] <shoky> Bloomberg: i donno that plugin
[13:48:14] <grafi> funny that you're still on that Bloomberg
[14:00:07] <Andrew_> In the sources, it lists /2.0, /2.2, and /2. /2 seems to be the same as /2.2.. where is /2.4?
[14:00:26] <Andrew_> well then again maybe /2.x all has the same date.
[14:02:13] <shoky> wat
[14:03:08] <Andrew_> http://repo.elastix.org/elastix
[14:04:19] <shoky> o well
[14:04:42] <Andrew_> ?
[14:05:04] <shoky> ?
[14:05:14] <Andrew_> err...
[14:05:17] <Andrew_> ugh. How'd I get here.
[14:05:29] <shoky> ._.
[14:09:39] <grafi> lawl
[14:09:40] <grafi> xD
[14:11:13] <Bloomberg> grafi: man is that I don't know why this still with many attemps
[14:11:20] <Bloomberg> can do you help me?
[14:11:47] <grafi> if i had a solution I would already have told you :P
[14:12:04] <grafi> the way the plugin arranges the events just sucks for what you want to do
[14:12:30] <grafi> just let it go, hiding events from users is not a good idea anyways
[14:33:08] <Tingle> small question about jscript->php & JSON. im doing this to decode my json string: $_POST['data'] = json_decode($_POST['data']); echo $_POST['data']['name']['first']; the echo says "Cannot use object of type stdCLass as array" so it seems I need to convert this stdClass object the json_decode returns into an array, how do I do that?
[14:40:33] <V8Energy> This should be simple: $("td[class^='fc-col']").on("mousemove", function() { console.log("test"); }); <-- any ideas why this doesn't trigger? I checked that  $("td[class^='fc-col']") returns an array of td elements
[14:44:43] <Canabinoide> I am using jquerymobile with CodeIgniter, and when i access "mypage" (http://myhost/myproject/mypage) directly at the browser and then navigate into pages (instead of going at homepage first (http://myhost/myproject/)), all pages loads normally every time(getting updated when modified at database) but "mypage" didn't update and just get opened as it were a static page... It doesn't happen when i access myproject at root(homepage)
[15:05:59] <rgr> whats the proper JQ approach to  "if there are no elements with this class on the page then do this"
[15:11:59] <systemfault> if ($('.lol').length === 0) { console.log('sad… no lols on the page'); }
[15:11:59] <duch_kazatel> if ($('.your-class').length === 0){/*your code here*/};
[15:12:03] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:12:06] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[15:12:10] <systemfault> :)
[15:19:19] <petey> herro
[15:19:21] <petey> is it possible to override one jquery function with another?
[15:19:23] <petey> for example, i have ('html') fading in
[15:19:25] <petey> but i would like to delay one of the elements on that html page before it fades in
[15:20:33] <rgr> aha thnks.
[15:21:40] <Sarseo> Is it possible to make a jsonp .ajax() call synchronous? I know that sounds weird.
[15:21:56] <YammYcoding> hello guys!
[15:23:50] <jjmalina> anyone run into some kind of crazy event loop w/ foundation and jquery? here's a screen of my cpu profile http://cl.ly/image/1k3f171x3F3K
[15:23:51] <YammYcoding> i have an old fan site that i'd like to change somethings to jquery. Can anyone see the site? It's behaving odd in php 5.3 at the cross links part.
[15:27:54] <tw2113> huh YammYcoding ?
[15:28:29] <YammYcoding> it's an old code with some iframe tricks. that are not working when moved to php 5.3
[15:28:43] <tw2113> ok
[15:28:48] <YammYcoding> i was wondering if i could change it to inner div maybe with jq
[15:29:00] <tw2113> i'd find a way to ditch the iframes personal;ly
[15:29:02] <YammYcoding> and avoid the unwanted refresh
[15:29:06] <tw2113> way more pain than worth
[15:29:27] <nhulea> Hi
[15:29:30] <YammYcoding> it's odd cause at php 5.2 it was working fine
[15:29:48] <YammYcoding> when i moved host, something makes the iframe trick not work anymore
[15:29:59] <tw2113> sensible hosts is my smartass guess
[15:30:09] <YammYcoding> i have a map with numbers. and at the left, i have an iframe with the reference to the map number clicked.
[15:30:25] <YammYcoding> if you see u'll get it
[15:30:26] <tw2113> have you actually checked your js console yet?
[15:30:41] <nhulea> Is there any reason why my jquery fadeIn and fadeOut would not work sometimes like one of every 10 or 20 it would not fire and I would get a blank screen ?
[15:30:46] <YammYcoding> it's that it's refreshing the iframe for some unknown reason
[15:31:27] <YammYcoding> i find no errors in chrome but maybe it's me hehe
[15:31:51] <YammYcoding> can i call u pvt for the link?
[15:32:18] <nhulea> I am going to put together a fiddle so you can see my code
[15:33:43] <YammYcoding> tw2 left?
[15:57:17] <Z_A_M> Could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? The ajax call is not being made when I hit enter. https://dpaste.de/WzkFE/
[16:12:41] <BHSPiMonkey> Maybe off-topic, but does anyone familiar with the tablesorter plugin know if there's a way to disable columns with empty headers? (e.g. <th></th>)
[16:14:41] <nhulea> is there a way I can reduce this down http://pastebin.com/faS7M5CE
[16:14:56] <nhulea> it works but I d like to reduce the code
[16:29:45] <visua> hello friends
[16:38:21] <juboba> does anybody know tinyMCE?
[16:39:46] <YammYcoding> what's the jquery equivalent to an iframe, if I need passing values to this?
[16:55:33] <visua> http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-5s/ trying to find a way to do something similar to this page
[17:05:09] <visua> www.michaelnovia.net/_themes/FullHeight/Build/index.html I've got this page setup, where each section.hero is 100% height
[17:09:00] <grafi> what about scrollTo visua
[17:09:23] <oliwe> when i use $.ajax and datatype jsonp, what should i be looking at to understand how to parse the stuff i get from the callback
[17:09:30] <visua> grafi yeah, Im using that.
[17:09:37] <oliwe> pretty new to javascript and all im getting is something thats a [object Object]
[17:09:41] <grafi> not good then?
[17:09:57] <visua> grafi sure it works, if you click the branding @ the top it will scroll down.
[17:10:11] <visua> But then if you resize you see it's pushed down by the section above it resizing as well
[17:10:17] <visua> trying to prevent that from happening, so it feels more fluid
[17:11:34] <visua> http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-5s/
[17:11:36] <visua> here's an example
[17:11:39] <grafi> fantastic how little apple cares about resizing oô
[17:11:41] <grafi> ?
[17:12:14] <visua> heh
[17:12:30] <oliwe> funny thats the thing i was looking at too visua
[17:12:48] <visua> :)
[17:12:50] <talntid> Tracert -h 100 216.81.59.173
[17:15:11] <oliwe> anyways could someone push me in the right direction, got a $.ajax with jsonp working and im getting success, i just dont know how to parse what im reccieving from the callback im getting something like
[17:15:12] <oliwe> mycallback({"error":true,"message":"Unsuported method GET. POST was expected.","payload":null});
[17:15:14] <oliwe> when i go to it
[17:15:24] <oliwe> with my browser
[17:15:27] <oliwe> the thing im posting to
[17:16:22] <initself> i had the idea to use jquery Dialog to popup a box and allow for ajax content to be created
[17:16:31] <initself> however, i am doing this in a table, with a lot of records
[17:16:51] <initself> the examples they give use #ids and there's a one to one correspondence between dialog and a button
[17:16:59] <initself> i am trying to do it with classes
[17:17:05] <initself> it quickly overwhelms my server
[17:17:09] <initself> computer
[17:17:18] <initself> fuck it, i am so tired, i am in coeherent
[17:18:24] <grafi> gn8 initself
[17:24:40] <visua> well, going down the page is fairly easy, its going back up it that seems like a bit of a challonge!
[17:29:36] <oliwe> dat feel when error
[17:29:37] <oliwe> and not knowing why
[17:30:10] <grafi> much confusion. the feels. so oblivion
[17:30:14] <oliwe> yeah
[17:30:26] <oliwe> i always almost cry when im doing something like this thats hard
[17:30:30] <oliwe> but the rewards are great
[17:30:33] <grafi> oO
[17:30:57] <oliwe> i go to stackoverflow, gets told it works
[17:31:00] <oliwe> it doesnt work for me
[17:31:04] <oliwe> ;__;
[17:31:26] <oliwe> doing a cross site post with .ajax, it posts it and 200 OK
[17:31:33] <oliwe> but .ajax goes to error
[17:31:40] <oliwe> and i have no idea why
[17:31:53] <grafi> cool
[17:32:05] <oliwe> haha not really
[17:32:29] <oliwe> i'm suppose to be able to do cross site posts right and reccieve whatever it gets back
[17:32:40] <malibu> Hi there..  I have a div with a main menu.  Upon hitting the login, I do a 'load' on the menu which brings in the logout link.  I just figured out I need to use 'on' on the parent for the click event on the logout link..... However when I hit the logout link I need to load the main menu again from within the 'on click' event and this is not working.  Any suggestions?
[17:33:01] <grafi> well if you control the backend of the page you're posting to
[17:33:14] <grafi> or the page allows that kind of thing
[17:33:26] <grafi> otherwise cross site is usually not allowed
[17:33:47] <oliwe> yeah it allows it
[17:34:10] <grafi> so then it should work
[17:34:30] <oliwe> well im not 100% sure it supports it, but it should, seeing how i was told to do it
[17:34:41] <oliwe> maybe its a test to see how much i know
[17:35:29] <visua> www.michaelnovia.net/_themes/FullHeight/Build/index.html
[17:35:37] <visua> got it working going down, if you press the down arrow
[17:35:48] <visua> gotta figure out how to make it go back up now, and fight that jump problem.
[17:36:07] <grafi> dat jump
[17:36:08] <grafi> <:
[17:36:43] <visua> yeah
[17:36:47] <visua> dat jummmmp
[17:36:50] <oliwe> why doesnt it werk ;__;
[17:37:57] <grafi> its twerking
[17:38:09] <visua> man i was going to make a twerking joke
[17:38:12] <visua> but nope
[17:38:16] <visua> way to go grafi
[17:38:28] <grafi> well
[17:38:34] <grafi> somebody obv had to do it
[17:38:37] <visua> you're a thunder thief
[17:40:03] <grafi> grafi jackson
[17:41:14] <visua> dewd. this going upward is killing meeee
[17:41:25] <grafi> dont die plz
[17:41:51] <visua> ill try not to, man.
[17:42:46] <visua> its uber buggy
[17:43:18] <visua> oh, derp.
[17:43:26] <grafi> twerkin?
[17:43:29] <visua> i know the problem, just not how fixy.
[17:43:44] <grafi> no fixy. not so good.
[17:44:08] <visua> Fix it Felix!
[17:44:22] <visua> yeah, well since it doesn't actually scroll up, my complete handler is never fired.
[17:44:25] <visua> weaksauce.
[17:44:30] <grafi> So should I just bang my hammer on your head?
[17:44:56] <visua> nah dude
[17:44:58] <visua> that shit would suck
[17:46:03] <oliwe> why does jsonp only accept get's
[17:46:05] <oliwe> and not posts
[17:46:29] <visua> security?
[17:46:32] <systemfault> Because JSONP is a hack
[17:46:35] <oliwe> hmm okey
[17:46:47] <oliwe> well i got a site that accepts crosssite posts
[17:47:02] <oliwe> and im getting my .ajax to post, but it just goes to error
[17:47:07] <oliwe> i cant figure out what im doing wrong
[17:47:09] <systemfault> oliwe: The longer explaination is that JSONP doesn't use ajax but a script tag
[17:47:22] <systemfault> <script> can only do a GET request.
[17:47:30] <oliwe> ok
[17:47:34] <oliwe> i can see in the console that it successfully posts
[17:47:41] <oliwe> but i want to do stuff with the callback
[17:51:02] <visua> >:|
[17:52:22] <oliwe> http://jsfiddle.net/PS7yY/1/
[17:52:24] <oliwe> this is what im trying to do
[17:52:29] <oliwe> now it wont work cause jsfiddle wont accept it
[17:56:56] <oliwe> i mean why would you allow .ajax to go to error
[17:57:02] <oliwe> if it successfully posts something already
[17:57:12] <oliwe> isnt the "damage" already done
[18:01:55] <initself> if you have a popup, how easy is it to get information to come back to the screen that called the popup?

[18:29:57] <petey> Anyone still around?
[18:30:33] <petey> this jquery slideUp function is actually sliding my content off the page :*(
[18:30:33] <petey> i want the whole div to slide up
[18:46:14] <raj> I have an autocomplete field, but I want to get a value from it that isn't the text itself, is that possible?
[18:46:23] <raj> can I have some sort of `id` to reference the text?
[18:47:32] <raj> using the jqui autocomplet, or must I write the function to do this check against an associative array on my own
[18:57:13] <jp-> raj, handle the selected event, you can get the selected item along with other fields that go with it. you can assign the field you need to a hidden field or whatever suits your purposes.
[19:06:21] <Ericx2x> anyone know of some good javascript sliders?
[19:06:45] <systemfault> jquery cycle2 is probably the best
[19:06:55] <systemfault> Simple yet very versatile.
[19:07:15] <Ericx2x> ty
[19:40:51] <Cpudan80> Hey
[19:40:57] <Cpudan80> Got a weird problem with a datepicker
[19:41:05] <Cpudan80> here's a little js fiddle
[19:41:07] <Cpudan80> http://jsfiddle.net/ym7nF/
[19:41:24] <Cpudan80> If I move the dateTB box to the bottom (below "end of div") it doesn't display...
[19:41:30] <Cpudan80> but why...
[19:46:37] <Cpudan80> hmm, apparently the css can't be display: none -- I sware it worked before that way
[19:46:48] <Cpudan80> well anyway - this will work I think
[19:51:34] <Ericx2x> systemfault you there?
[19:51:43] <systemfault> Yes, why?
[19:52:01] <Ericx2x> whops I realized i should look at the Demos for this probably
[19:52:16] <Ericx2x> I was going to ask you how to add the dots on the slider for cycle2
[20:11:20] <anew> how can i check if a div exists on the page or not?  i'm trying if ( $("#ads").is(":visible") ) { but it's not working
[20:19:01] <Cpudan80> anew: no is
[20:19:10] <Cpudan80>  .visible
[20:19:29] <Cpudan80> oh sorry this is jquery
[20:19:42] <Cpudan80> anew: ehh yeah that should work, what's it returning?
[20:26:10] <anew> hey sorry thought it was dead in here, let me check
[20:26:30] <anew> well
[20:26:34] <anew> i changed it to .length
[20:26:37] <anew> and get this error
[20:26:38] <anew> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[20:27:01] <Cpudan80> are you sure that's the right selector?
[20:27:34] <Cpudan80> also is visible is not "exists"
[20:27:35] <anew> well that's the thing, it doesnt exist
[20:27:41] <anew> i need to check if it's there or not
[20:27:51] <anew> if ( $("#ads").length ) {
[20:28:04] <obert> .find?
[20:29:14] <anew> hmm wait a second... so i'm doing if ( $("#ads").length ) { and inside this i have a .length and for that i'm getting the error
[20:29:19] <anew> well let me just paste the whole thing not long
[20:30:03] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ek4K/
[20:30:24] <anew> on line 8 i'm getting Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[20:32:46] <systemfault> Are you sure jquery is loaded?
[20:32:52] <systemfault> At least, when that call is made
[20:33:07] <anew> yep if i remove the if it works
[20:33:18] <anew> well remove the if and insert the element #ads it works
[20:36:36] <anew> hmmm actually it works in fiddle doesnt it ?
[20:47:02] <anew> had to change the selectors name in the code
[21:16:10] <jnewt> i'm trying to use the floatThead plugin, and am getting an Uncaught ReferenceError: _ is not defined  does the _ have any special meaning?
[21:34:28] <relipse>  can some generous Linux OR mac guys code a few functions for JsRoboKey that are platform specific, such as: https://github.com/relipse/JsRoboKey/blob/master/jsrobokey.cpp#L84
[21:47:31] <aFeijo> hi folks, I'm looking for a plugin or how to implement a zoom effect that after you click an image in a grid 3x4, the image will expand (without affecting the grid) and other elements will show up bellow that image (title, tags, etc.)
[21:48:02] <aFeijo> I try zoomooz but that one zoom the whole page or container (including the text), I need to do it for the image only
[21:53:57] <initself> what's the best way to lookup an attribute by a number?
[21:54:24] <initself> for instance, you could use id="foo1", but then you have to lookup with some kind of regex-y tihng
[21:55:15] <initself> you could also just go id="1" but that seems wrong
[21:56:31] <initself> if( $(this).attr('id').match(/pattern/) ) { isn't bad i guess
[21:57:19] <initself> not sure
[21:59:06] <initself> i'm gonna go with a data attribute
[22:01:13] <aFeijo> no suggestions?
[22:12:03] <hoodoowoo> is there a way to capture that a user has clicked on a select element, but canceled the change?  I.e., I want a way for the user to be able to reload a part of the page without having to first load another value.  I'd rather not introduce another UI element.
[22:31:18] <lemonsparrow> hola
[22:32:03] <slartsa> halo
[22:32:19] <slartsa> oh, didn't mean to misspell that
[22:35:08] <LoneSoldier728> hey so if i want to keep the background image fixed
[22:35:17] <raj> that's so weird that .css's background-image value needs the "url()" portion
[22:35:23] <LoneSoldier728> and the boxes i put on top of it
[22:35:27] <LoneSoldier728> how do i go about that
[22:35:30] <gaurav21r> background-position: fixed
[22:35:41] <gaurav21r> Sorry I mean background-scroll
[22:36:02] <LoneSoldier728> when i say fixed im not referring to a scroll
[22:36:08] <LoneSoldier728> but if someone's screen is bigger or smaller
[22:36:15] <LoneSoldier728> I want it to be one resolution basically
[22:38:22] <LoneSoldier728> hm see the problem is that the coordinates on a page when stretched to bigger resolution move out of place
[22:38:35] <LoneSoldier728> when I want them to stretch with or stay in place
[22:38:35] <slartsa> has anyone managed to properly crop <video> content so that the video stream is in the middle of the element and can have variations in its dimensions?
[22:39:37] <LoneSoldier728> basically how do i keep the background image and the data points i placed on it in sync
[23:17:27] <hexacode> hey you guys whats the proper way to indicate a variable based selector with a string also...for example. i have the this keyword as my selected element, but then i want to also indicate that im selecting a sub eleemtn of this   ..in my mind, im thinking something like $(this+'> .direct_decendant')  but i think im wrong.
[23:44:17] <raj> why can't I filter 2 DOM levels deep?
[23:44:28] <rainabba> Filter? What? how?
[23:44:43] <rainabba> An array?
[23:45:05] <raj> $retrievedhtml.filter('#content').find('#right-column')
[23:45:05] <rainabba> A selector?
[23:45:34] <raj> I can do `$retrievedhtml.filter('#content').find('#right-column')`, but I can't do $retrievedhtml.filter('#content #right-column')
[23:46:43] <rainabba> raj: why not just $retrievedhtml.find('#content #right-column')?
[23:46:59] <rainabba> Are you doing something with the results which make that less ideal?
[23:47:07] <geiregjo> That's to obvious
[23:47:12] <rainabba> :)
[23:47:17] <rainabba> too obvious ;)
[23:47:40] * geiregjo just had his first coffee so give him a break
[23:47:42] <rainabba> I remember those days as if they were way to recent.
[23:47:57] <rainabba> Likely they were :P
[23:47:59] <raj> I can't use `find` directory because there is an array of $ objects
[23:48:16] <raj> *directory = directly
[23:48:35] <raj> there is an array of $ objects within $retreivedhtml
[23:49:29] <rainabba> raj $.each($retrievedhtml, function(){ }) is likely what you want then.
[23:49:48] <rainabba> .filter() and .find() are for DOM and it sounds like you want to work with an array, not dom.
[23:49:59] <raj> ok, so filter and then find is faster
[23:50:06] <raj> it's actually DOM
[23:50:14] <rainabba> raj: grep() might be of interest too.
[23:50:15] <geiregjo> array does has a filter function, maybe that's why you are confused
[23:50:17] <raj> just when I do $(data) it makes an array of the top level elements
[23:50:33] <rainabba> raj: ALL selectors return an array.
[23:50:51] <rainabba> raj: Even if there's only one result, it's an array
[23:50:53] <raj> yes, but this is a normal array, not a jquery array
[23:51:04] <raj> *object
[23:51:04] <rainabba> <raj> it's actually DOM
[23:51:10] <rainabba> Make up your mind man
[23:51:15] <raj> I meant each item within the array is actually DOM
[23:51:50] <rainabba> raj: Ok, time for an example if you want more help
[23:51:59] <rainabba> jsfiddle is your friend
[23:52:34] <rainabba> How you're populating $retrievedhtml might be relevant too, but I'm confident that you're just making this harder than it really needs to be.
[23:53:40] * rainabba crawls on his office cot like a good work-a-holic.
[23:54:25] <Cork> raj: filter works on a set of elements in the jquery object
[23:54:37] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/?a=register
[23:54:44] <Cork> raj: while find searches through the dom tree from the elements in the dom object
[23:54:47] <ross`> can someone tell me why the usernmae field background color won't change
[23:54:56] <Cork> raj: so as the children isn't in the dom object, you can't filter them
[23:55:32] <Cork> raj: and for the same reason, find can't find elements in the object, unless they are in the dom tree below one of the elements in the object
[23:55:51] <rainabba> ross`: I just changed it without trouble. How are you trying to change it?
[23:56:14] <ross`> when the user lets up a key
[23:56:18] <ross`> in the username field
[23:56:20] <ross`> it should run the check
[23:56:23] <Cork> ross`: .val().length() isn't a function
[23:56:25] <ross`> if the length of the value is elss than two
[23:56:28] <ross`> it turns teh background red
[23:56:34] <ross`> otherwise it turns the backgronud green
[23:56:35] <Cork> length is a property of strings
[23:56:48] <ross`> .val is numerical?
[23:56:55] <Cork> no it's a string
[23:57:02] <rainabba> ross`: $('#register_username_field').css('background-color', 'red');
[23:57:05] <rainabba> works just fine
[23:57:07] <Cork> var ulen=$('#register_username_field').val().length(); => var ulen=$('#register_username_field').val().length;
[23:57:45] <Cork> ross`: also you should prob think about moving your styles into your css file
[23:57:49] <Cork> and use classes instead
[23:57:52] <ross`> perfect!
[23:58:00] <ross`> um
[23:58:01] <Cork> css doens't belong in js
[23:58:04] <ross`> my styles are in css
[23:58:13] <Cork> registry.js is full of css
[23:58:14] <ross`> this is just for changing the style dynamically
[23:58:18] <ross`> yes
[23:58:23] <ross`> it's changing cs based on situations
[23:58:28] <ross`> default css is in the css file
[23:58:33] <ross`> do you think i shuld add classes
[23:58:35] <ross`> is what youa re saying
[23:58:35] <Cork> like i said, move the css into the css file
[23:58:36] <ross`> in thejs
[23:58:39] <Cork> and use classes from js
[23:58:40] <ross`> ahh, i got ya
[23:58:41] <rainabba> ross`: $('#register_username_field').css('background-color', $('#register_username_field').val().length > 0 ? 'red' : 'blue');
[23:58:54] <rainabba> throw that in a change()
[23:59:06] <Cork> ross`: and finally, if you want a boolean return a boolean, and not 0 1 :)
[23:59:15] <ross`> it's gonna do more checks
[23:59:16] <ross`> with ajax
[23:59:22] <ross`> like if username exists etc
[23:59:24] <ross`> i got this
[23:59:25] <ross`> :O
[23:59:32] <ross`> thanks for your help
[23:59:39] <Cork> np
[23:59:45] <rainabba> ross`: So build on it. Also, use addClass() and removeClass() then store the css in a file for a more clean approach.
