[00:03:54] <diverdude> hello, if i do a=[6,2,5,20] and a. sort() i get: [ 2, 20, 5, 6 ]. of course that is undesired, and i suppose its because javascript thinks the numbers are characters. But how do i sort it correctly then?
[00:06:25] <systemfault> >> var a = [6,2,5,20]; a.sort(function(a,b) { return a-b; }); a;
[00:06:42] <systemfault> ?js var a = [6,2,5,20]; a.sort(function(a,b) { return a-b; }); a;
[00:06:45] <bot-t> systemfault: [2, 5, 6, 20]
[00:06:50] <systemfault> Anywayâ€¦ it's like that.
[00:07:07] <diverdude> thx
[02:04:03] <Bartzy> Hi
[02:04:27] <Bartzy> I have an AJAX request just before I use window.location to move off a page. How can I make sure the ajax request is finished?
[02:04:43] <Bartzy> the only way is to put the window.location inside the complete callback of the AJAX request ?
[02:06:18] <porton> Clicking the image in the left sidebar at http://vaiman.org/ we have TOO SMALL youtube. I need to make youtube area greater. How?
[02:07:05] <siovene> Hi. I'm trying to do something like this: $.when($.ajax("/page1.php"), $.ajax("/page2.php")).done(function(a1,  a2){}); but I don't know in advance how many ajax calls I need to make in the .when command. It depends on how many checkboxes the user checked.
[02:07:21] <siovene> How can I prepare a list of functions and then pass it to $.when?
[02:07:39] <porton> ... http://vaiman.org/wp-content/themes/vaiman/javascript/youtube.js
[02:07:45] <siovene> Also, $.done should then get a list of arguments.

[02:44:54] <t432> after retrieving data from server and appending it to some div then click browser refresh, contents disappears. I guess I need to protect it from browser refresh, how is it normally done?
[02:47:54] <shoky> siovene: with apply. e.g.  $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises).done(function(data1, data2, data3) { ... });

[02:55:57] <Noeble> anyone able to look a look?
[02:57:48] <shoky> Noeble: .position() only has top & left, not right
[02:58:36] <shoky> so your dialos.css("right",..) isn't doing anything
[02:59:02] <Noeble> shoky: explains why it wont work then
[02:59:07] <shoky> Noeble: i just did
[02:59:22] <Noeble> I said.. "that explains why it wont work"
[02:59:23] <Noeble> :)
[02:59:24] <shoky> Noeble: $('#menucontent').position().right === undefined
[02:59:27] <shoky> ohh
[02:59:29] <shoky> ;)
[02:59:30] <Noeble> :D
[02:59:43] <Noeble> so, any tip on how to solve the issue?
[02:59:46] <Noeble> must be a way
[02:59:50] <Noeble> to position it correctly
[03:00:04] <shoky> well to know the best way i'd have to see the actual html layout,
[03:00:05] <hoolter1> how can i convert an array of three decimal rgb vals to a hex #COLOR ?
[03:00:07] <shoky> but
[03:00:37] <shoky> Noeble: dialog.css("right", $('#menucontent').position().left + $('#menucontent').width());   or something should do what you were trying to..
[03:03:06] <Noeble> shoky: not working, but I understand that its hard without the html
[03:11:24] <shoky> hoolter1: var rgb = [0,100,255], hex = '#' + $.map(rgb, function(c) { var hex = c.toString(16); return hex.length == 1 ? "0" + hex : hex }).join(''); hex
[03:11:27] <shoky> er
[03:11:29] <Noeble> shoky: here is the html, perhaps you can point me in the right direction. http://pastebin.com/x8mUDXk2
[03:11:31] <shoky> ?js var rgb = [0,100,255], hex = '#' + $.map(rgb, function(c) { var hex = c.toString(16); return hex.length == 1 ? "0" + hex : hex }).join(''); hex
[03:11:33] <bot-t> shoky: "#0064ff"
[03:12:32] <shoky> Noeble: eh sorry, not gonna look through that :) and i have to go anyways. make a jsfiddle (jsfiddle.net) showing your issue and post the link here, you'll get help for sure
[03:12:51] <shoky> Noeble: and seperate your css from your html
[03:14:02] <hoolter1> shoky thanks. :)
[03:14:47] <Noeble> shoky: aight, yea well thats for testing purpose only =)
[03:14:53] <Noeble> css that is
[03:16:16] <hoolter1> grrr just found out from #css i could do $('alskdjf').css('color',  'RGB(' + dC[0] + ', ' + dC[1] + ', ' + dC[2] + ')';
[03:16:32] <t432> instead of a button click, i'd like to trigger an ajax call to server when browser scroll reaches the bottom.
[03:16:33] <hoolter1> s/;/);
[03:17:02] <t432> any ideas on how to do this?
[03:32:17] <siovene> shoky: cool, thanks. But what about the argument's to .done's function? You wrote (data1, data2, data3).
[03:39:23] <hoolter1> how can i drag allow user to drag an image from fs onto viewport and then display image back in an <img> tag?
[03:41:26] <Noeble> question: I have issues with positioning a dropdown div with jquery. I have a working example here: http://jsfiddle.net/qsJKf/  . When you hover the "97 EUR" a dropdown shows..

[03:51:56] <trailbar> is there a good channel for general javascript qns? as #javascript is invite only
[03:53:10] <systemfault> It's not, you simply need to register to the network (nickserv)

[04:05:23] <mink> How I can execute function, when ajax->success function is full-executed?
[04:06:51] <hoolter1> is a data: uri considered X-origin?
[04:10:53] <cusco_> mink: can't you just call it last in the sucess?
[04:12:44] <mink> cusco_, I cant, becouse this function not return any data.   (In success function I append text to div .categoryJSON, and after that I want get text from this div, and this is empty. I think it's executed before completly load to DOM)

[04:21:30] <brettfrable> so for example the container is 800 px
[04:21:54] <brettfrable> but ideally it should calculate 1/3 of any set width of the container

[04:51:20] <brettfrable> tried that

[04:51:53] <ravenzz> isn't static there?
[04:52:05] <brettfrable> what do you mean?
[04:52:07] <ravenzz> I mean are you talking about that 800
[04:52:08] <ravenzz> ?
[04:52:12] <brettfrable> yeah
[04:52:20] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/95EtZ/2/
[04:52:36] <brettfrable> ohhh
[04:52:53] <brettfrable> i was doing $scrollingDiv.width(); * (1 - (winScrollTop / zeroSizeHeight));
[04:52:58] <ravenzz> eh
[04:52:59] <brettfrable> and that wasn't working
[04:53:06] <jomofcw> Hello !
[04:53:10] <brettfrable> how come?
[04:53:20] <jomofcw> Do you know guy a "good" reflection plugin OK for text and image ?
[04:53:37] <ravenzz> because it keeps getting the new value everytime you scroll
[04:53:51] <ravenzz> $scrollingDiv.css({
[04:53:51] <ravenzz>         width: newSize
[04:54:05] <ravenzz> everytime you scroll the width change
[04:54:12] <brettfrable> Thanks ravenzz - could you possibly help me with the 1/3 calculation.
[04:54:23] <brettfrable> so it only allows it to resize 1/3 of the containers width
[04:54:26] <t432> what will be themethod to add a new div as opposed to append()?
[04:54:31] <t432> the method*
[04:54:39] <ravenzz> well actually I not 100% sure what do you mean with 1/3
[04:54:56] <brettfrable> so 1/3 of the the containers width is 266px
[04:55:00] <ravenzz> ah you want to stop at 1/
[04:55:01] <ravenzz> 3
[04:55:03] <ravenzz> ?
[04:55:07] <brettfrable> yeah
[04:56:39] <jomofcw> I've got one which apply to text and another apply to image, but I can't find one that work with both image and text.
[04:59:08] <ravenzz> brettfrable there you go http://jsfiddle.net/95EtZ/3/
[04:59:49] <ravenzz> you would probably refactor it a little bit, "caching" the selector eg $win = $(window);
[05:08:25] <t432> i have a bunch of values in array that I want to display within a html page.  each value should be set within its own div.  append() lumps everything within the same div.  what is the name of the lib function to enable this?
[05:10:10] <Noeble> t432: use a for loop and append a div including each value?

[05:13:47] <AngryMan> Hi guys
[05:13:59] <AngryMan> Someone please suggest me a good jquery modal plugin!
[05:14:01] <AngryMan> something like colorbox
[05:17:37] <abletony84> sorry did i miss anything?
[05:17:56] <abletony84> AngryMan: did you try jquery ui dialog?
[05:17:57] <AngryMan> Yes, I was asking which one to choose between colorbox vs fancybox?
[05:18:12] <AngryMan> abletony84: No I didn't, but i thought it was limited
[05:18:51] <abletony84> hmmmm
[05:19:19] <AngryMan> I want to load some page(containing forms) into the modal via ajax,
[05:19:34] <AngryMan> and then submit that form again via ajax, and display result in the same modal
[05:19:56] <mehrdad> i want to show a simple menu animation, but i can't http://jsfiddle.net/U25NG/
[05:20:05] <mehrdad> the animation kinda stutters
[05:20:14] <mehrdad> if you know what i mean
[05:21:23] <mehrdad> i didn't make up a demo, 'cause i believe the only thing to blame is this jquery code
[05:21:52] <mehrdad> can someone please tell me what's wrong with that code?
[05:22:23] <mehrdad> at some pixels around the element, the slide animation stutters
[05:23:03] <mehrdad> if i move the mouse quickly into the element it animates nicely tho
[05:23:34] <mehrdad> and even then it is not constant
[05:24:01] <jomofcw> Is there a "reduce plugin" ? i.e. I want to reduce element like a DIV that contain text and images.0
[05:24:16] <K3|Chris> reduce?
[05:24:31] <abletony84> mehrdad: you could always snag my dropdown http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Sw4Y4/
[05:24:40] <abletony84> hoverintent makes it a lot sexier imho
[05:25:18] <mehrdad> hmm thanks, let me see...
[05:25:56] <abletony84> (nevermind that arrow_wrapper bullshit in the html though that stuff is long gone anyway)
[05:27:36] <glontu> hi
[05:27:39] <jomofcw> K3|Chris hello ^^ yea, I want to create a carrousel effect. So i need some elements to be smaller when it is not at the first place
[05:27:45] <jomofcw> reduce/minimize
[05:27:54] <jomofcw> dunno what's the correct word in english :/
[05:28:06] <glontu> i have a problem with scrollTop() ... when i scroll to the bottom of the page it returns nothing. Can anyone help ?
[05:28:07] <jomofcw> I can show you an image if you want
[05:29:22] <K3|Chris> jomofcw: I don't get it, to make a carousel you just need to move things
[05:29:58] <mehrdad> abletony84: can't get it to work on my page :/, trying to figure out what's wrong
[05:30:31] <mehrdad> i just replaced the selectors with my own, yet it fails to open the menu
[05:31:37] <jomofcw> K3|Chris see this plz : http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/819/lesclubs.jpg/
[05:32:47] <abletony84> mehrdad: could you put up a demo?
[05:34:27] <mehrdad> it has to do with hoverintent, i dunno what it does
[05:36:17] <jomofcw> K3|Chris always here ? The image I upload will show you what I'm asking for
[05:36:39] <siovene> shoky: pingP?
[05:36:40] <K3|Chris> jomofcw: looks like you just want it to move left/right and be small large small
[05:36:41] <siovene> ping*
[05:37:25] <abletony84> mehrdad: google it
[05:37:31] <mehrdad> yeah
[05:38:05] <mehrdad> more like bing it :p
[05:38:24] <jomofcw> K3|Chris yea but including text small :/
[05:38:29] <jomofcw> dunno how to do that...
[05:38:40] <mehrdad> ahh, it's a plugin abletony84
[05:38:48] <mehrdad> can it not be done without it?
[05:38:51] <jomofcw> If I juts change the size of the div, it won't change the size of the content
[05:40:04] <t432> this seems to work. can it be improved?  jQuery('<div/>', {text: value.statusMessage}).appendTo('.data');
[05:40:09] <K3|Chris> jomofcw: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Scale
[05:40:39] <t432> can I add a class name along with div?
[05:40:51] <t432> as it stands <div></div>
[05:41:11] <t432> desired <div class="foo"></div>
[05:43:29] <t432> aha. just noticed the nested div.  would like it if all divs were  independent  of each other
[05:45:46] <abletony84> mehrdad: yeah but hoverintent is better than regular hover at least from a user experience perspective
[05:46:27] <mehrdad> ok, sorted  it out , the a selector was at fault
[05:46:39] <mehrdad> changed it to just li
[05:48:15] <mehrdad> not! the slidedown effect ruins it
[05:49:00] <mehrdad> same code with no slidedown effect , just simple show() shows no stuttering
[05:56:02] <mehrdad> it sounds like a bug in slidedown

[06:21:17] <sm`> hello
[06:21:38] <sm`> how come $(this).next().toggle(); find and toggles the child and $(this).children().toggle(); doesnt
[06:22:07] <sm`> i specificly need to select only the children of the element
[06:22:23] <daftspunk> next() is the next element across the DOM
[06:22:31] <daftspunk> children() is the elements down the DOM
[06:22:46] <daftspunk> try nextAll() and u might find it works
[06:23:01] <mehrdad> got it working finally with hover instead of the stinking mouseover, phew
[06:26:00] <sm`> nextAll works but i cant use it cuz it deletes all the elements in the list
[06:26:29] <sm`> and i only to toggle the nested elements of the selected element
[06:26:48] <daftspunk> use .find(*) then
[06:26:55] <sm`> practically i got nest ul's
[06:26:59] <sm`> and i need to toggle them
[06:27:03] <daftspunk> .find('*').toggle()
[06:27:30] <daftspunk> or .find('>*') for first level but children should do that and i assume that doesnt work
[06:28:16] <sm`> wont work
[06:28:18] <sm`> both ways

[06:48:38] <defaultro> $('#someid').click, $(':text').focusin, $(this).blur  question about these 3. Other than click, focusin, or blur, what are other possible values and where can I find them?
[06:49:10] <daftspunk> defaultro: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[06:49:19] <defaultro> ah, so they are called events?
[06:49:29] <daftspunk> correct
[06:49:42] <defaultro> daftspunk, is it always 100% that is followed by event?
[06:50:15] <daftspunk> i failed to comprehend that statement
[06:50:22] <defaultro> oh sorry
[06:50:35] <defaultro> I mean, $('somevalue').event
[06:50:47] <daftspunk> please rephrase entirely
[06:50:55] <defaultro> ok, I'll try my best :)
[06:51:39] <sunbeam> I have an input field, the default value should dissapear when i click in it, and when nothing is filled in, it should be back again.. any idea how I can do this best?
[06:51:41] <defaultro> from what I have recently learned, the syntax of of jquery is $(some selector, id or element).followedby_event
[06:52:06] <defaultro> after the first parentheses, is it always going to be an event?
[06:52:26] <daftspunk> there are alternatives, i prefer to use $('#element').bind('event_name', function() { });
[06:52:26] <defaultro> like .click, .blue
[06:52:35] <defaultro> oh
[06:52:51] <defaultro> $('#element').bind('focusin', function() { }); should work?
[06:52:52] <daftspunk> although, $('#element').click(function(){}); is identical to $('#element').bind('click', function(){});
[06:53:04] <defaultro> sweet
[06:53:06] <kkoala> daftspunk: hm.. doesn't work either
[06:53:11] <daftspunk> using click as a function is for convinience
[06:53:45] <defaultro> daftspunk, I'm javascript and jquery beginner. I've been watching jquery youtube tutorials. I hope it's a good idea
[06:54:42] <daftspunk> defaultro: as with all programming there is many ways to engineer a solution, choose your mentors wisely :)
[06:55:15] <defaultro> any suggestions?
[06:55:17] <daftspunk> kkoala: view the source of that page for a working example
[06:56:00] <kkoala> daftspunk: thanks, will try to figure it out. is disableSelection() actually documented somewhere?
[06:57:26] <daftspunk> im not sure, i think it is a generic function to disable a UI element
[06:57:51] <daftspunk> i think you actually want this option - items: "li:not(.ui-state-disabled)"
[06:58:08] <daftspunk> the two suggestions work in tandum
[06:58:27] <kkoala> daftspunk: I suspect it simply prevents text in an element from being selected
[06:58:59] <daftspunk> yes, it adds the disabled style and any browser related tags to disable it
[06:59:19] <daftspunk> the option i mentioned above will look for that style and prevent it from being sortable
[07:00:38] <daftspunk> defaultro: i learn by reading code, so i cannot think of anything suitable for a beginner
[07:05:07] <defaultro> k
[07:06:16] <Deele> hey, is there any tutorial (I just dont know how to name it, to search) where I can $(slector).myFunction({options})
[07:07:47] <daftspunk> Deele: http://asimilia.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/jquery-extend-confusion/
[07:08:00] <Deele> thx
[07:08:03] <daftspunk> welcome
[07:13:20] <kkoala> daftspunk: i think my problem has to do with the way I'm adding the sortables dynamically - will figure it out. thanks for your pointers!
[07:14:05] <daftspunk> kkoala: np
[07:15:45] <Deele> daftspunk, hey, and can you tell me, how to reference that obj. that it was callend on?
[07:15:58] <daftspunk> Deele: use $(this)
[07:17:36] <nullucas> Hi. If I have to write an email address on a web page, other than writing it as an image, do you think that encrypting it with custom javascript is REALLY secure against bots? (ex: var address = weird_function(); $("#address").innerhtml(address);)
[07:18:28] <daftspunk> nullucas: as you using PHP?
[07:19:54] <FernandoBasso> Why does .focus fails on firefox?
[07:19:58] <daftspunk> nullucas: http://pastebin.com/W74iUpzc thats what i use, generates JS
[07:20:12] <FernandoBasso> Reading the docs...
[07:20:29] <nullucas> daftspunk, no, no PHP at all. Just javascript. weird_function() returns the address as a string, but it's all javascript
[07:21:33] <daftspunk> nullucas: "technically" bots dont compile javascript, they are simple programs that screen scrape webpages and blindly submit forms using $_POST - google's search engine has only just started to read JS generated content, so if the email address does not appear plaintext in the source code or in any linked files it should be fine
[07:22:10] <daftspunk> FernandoBasso: .focus() works fine for me on FF
[07:23:01] <Noeble> daftspunk: srry for late response, works fine for me, but you must upsize the site-window abit. Atm a black box apears below the tab with EUR
[07:23:21] <nullucas> daftspunk, yes "technically" it should work. I read some opinions online, and they were saying that using such methods they didn't get any spam in years. But I just wanted to hear another opinion, thanks
[07:23:48] <daftspunk> nullucas: i submit all my forms using ajax so i dont need to use captchas, their reports are accurate, i dont get spam
[07:24:18] <FernandoBasso> daftspunk: On line 67, that is where it is not working. Perhaps I did something wrong...
[07:24:31] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/Forms/02_dyn/
[07:24:45] <FernandoBasso> ^^ that is my 'application'.
[07:25:18] <FernandoBasso> Try on firefox for me if you have some time please. (just write an invalid email address in the email field and blur out of it...
[07:25:51] <nullucas> daftspunk, well, I know that using a contact form is the best method, but that DOESN'T show the email address on the page. If I really need to show the address for someone to read, I guess the only good methods are "images" and "encrypting with js"
[07:26:36] <daftspunk> nullucas: there are always people that harvest emails by hand so you cant really stop them even with an image, so image or JS generated text are the same i'd say
[07:31:37] <nullucas> daftspunk, ok, thanks
[07:36:25] <daftspunk> FernandoBasso: http://jsfiddle.net/qsJKf/1/
[07:39:49] <defaultro> this code, highlights the first <li>. What if I want alternating <li>s? $("ul.list li:first-child").css("background-color","blue");
[07:40:31] <daftspunk> replace :first-child with :odd
[07:41:21] <defaultro> very cool
[07:45:57] <FernandoBasso> daftspunk: Why that link?
[07:46:34] <daftspunk> sorry i think wrong person
[07:46:52] <daftspunk> was for Noeble
[07:49:57] <mercenary> anyone needs a website? I'll do it for 50 EUR's!
[07:50:03] <shokyz> t
[07:50:41] <defaultro> what's wrong with my code, I want to highlight each text when mouse is over it. http://jsfiddle.net/Kzu4F/
[08:05:30] <defaultro> anyone please?
[08:05:41] <FernandoBasso> Shouldn't you use .mouseover?
[08:05:42] <mercenary> wait dog
[08:05:45] <mercenary> I'll try to fix it
[08:06:23] <FernandoBasso> You forgot the quotes around 'li'?
[08:06:23] <defaultro> FernandoBasso, but I was thinking(based from Jquery's documentation) that it can manipulate any element
[08:06:30] <defaultro> i'll check
[08:06:37] <defaultro> it's a real element though
[08:06:44] <FernandoBasso> Try it!
[08:06:54] <mercenary> do it in css
[08:06:56] <defaultro> didn't work
[08:07:11] <FernandoBasso> Worked in jsfiddle.
[08:07:11] <defaultro> you can modify my code so I can see it
[08:07:22] <defaultro> what did you modify?
[08:07:30] <defaultro> i changed it to "li"
[08:07:38] <FernandoBasso> $('li').mouseover
[08:07:56] <defaultro> oh, i thought it was still focusin
[08:08:01] <defaultro> why didn't focusin work?
[08:08:16] <FernandoBasso> I really don't know. Not an expert in jQuery, sorry.
[08:08:52] <defaultro> ok. it worked but looks like i need to do a onmouseout
[08:09:20] <defaultro> but i think it's not going to retain the previous color, LOL
[08:09:24] <FernandoBasso> But you'll have to save the color it was before onmouseover, so that you can place it back on mouse out.
[08:09:27] <defaultro> yeah
[08:09:39] <defaultro> that's what I was thinking
[08:10:00] <defaultro> so not sure how it's properly implemented :)
[08:10:04] <sunbeam> I have an input field, the default value should dissapear when i click in it, and when nothing is filled in, it should be back again.. any idea how I can do this best?
[08:10:13] <FernandoBasso> but, apply a class instead, and do the styling in css.
[08:10:46] <defaultro> k
[08:13:03] <defaultro> it worked. http://jsfiddle.net/Kzu4F/1/
[08:13:15] <FernandoBasso> sunbeam: You have to use an if, copy the default value to a variable, clear it on focus. On blur, you check if it is empty. If it is, you place the default value back.
[08:13:54] <defaultro> looks like i need to spend time reading the events documentation of Jquery
[08:14:20] <defaultro> maybe focusin only works for textboxes
[08:14:27] <FernandoBasso> I think so.
[08:20:43] <defaultro> another question. How do I figure out which .js file is an object part of?
[08:20:43] <brettfrable> ugh - I'm using query draggable
[08:20:44] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/5haMZ/
[08:20:55] <brettfrable> and it stops working after my img click
[08:23:15] <sunbeam> FernandoBasso: ok
[08:28:56] <codepython777> is there something like starbox for jquery?
[08:43:24] <ravster> Hello everyone
[08:44:26] <hoolter> hi ravster
[08:50:06] <hoolter> if i define a function that uses jquery before i include jquery, nothing'll go wrong as long as i don't use it before i include jq, right?
[08:50:07] <codepython777> Is there a star rating widget somewhere that uses transparent backgrounds?
[08:51:20] <SP33D> Hello can some one tell me how i can modify $('a:contains("Base")').text('XXXXX'); this selector so that it only does it with links that contains base in a div that has a class called boxtext
[08:51:46] <hoolter> i mean, this flow should be fine, no? | <script>function useJQuery() { $('p').remove(); } </script> <script src=jquery.min.js></script><script>useJQuery();</script>
[08:53:55] <SP33D> can some one tell me how i can modfy this code sinppet so that it only gets applyed to a div with a class called boxtext ? $('a:contains("Base")').text('XXXXX');
[08:55:41] <linelevel> SP33D: you mean to an 'a' within that div?
[08:56:01] <trailbar> i have a <div id="foo"> <iframe ...> </div> - how do i select this? thought $('#foo iframe') but this returns empty array
[08:56:14] <SP33D> thats right linelevel
[08:56:22] <SP33D> at present the code applys to all a tags
[08:56:23] <anli__>  $('a:contains("Base")').find('div.boxtext').text('XXXXX');
[08:56:36] <SP33D> now i need it to be applyed only to ah thx
[08:56:44] <SP33D> good that i asked :D
[08:56:57] <linelevel> SP33D: So something like $('div.boxtext a:contains("Base")').text('XXXXX') ?
[08:57:14] <SP33D> line that would be more logical yes
[08:57:31] <SP33D> works it the way you told at present?
[08:57:50] <SP33D> div.boxtext selects a all divs with the class boxtext
[08:57:51] <SP33D> ?
[08:57:58] <anli__> yes
[08:58:04] <SP33D> thx
[08:58:42] <anli__> .boxtext can also be used, maybe that would be a great shorthand for div.boxtext
[08:59:09] <SP33D> thx a lot
[08:59:18] <SP33D> it worked nice and it was logical to me so i learnd
[08:59:20] <SP33D> thx a lot
[08:59:21] <SP33D> ^^
[09:01:53] <sonnie> hi, i want to display all data thru pagination, data source: JSON array. any hint?
[09:04:18] <hoolter> try autobrowse, sonnie
[09:08:28] <sonnie> thank you hoolter. but i wanna pagination effect.
[09:09:03] <shoky> bot-t, tell brettfrable need to call .draggable() again http://jsfiddle.net/5haMZ/1/
[09:09:03] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[09:13:05] <jammsen> sonnie: im searching something like that too, tell me please when you find something
[09:16:28] <Raydiation> getJSON is async right? so i cant put it into a function and return the data from within the getJSON callback
[09:16:56] <shoky> Raydiation: correct
[09:17:17] <Raydiation> any tips how to do this then? https://pastee.org/dbh25
[09:18:14] <shoky> don't return anything. do what you need in the callback
[09:18:34] <Raydiation> shoky: basically put everything in the callback?
[09:18:59] <shoky> also you're doing the prototype thing wrong, i think
[09:19:16] <shoky> ah nvm
[09:19:18] <shoky> sorry
[09:19:44] <shoky> Raydiation: you can have your fetchSettings function return $.getJSON(...);
[09:20:31] <Raydiation> shoky: ty
[09:20:36] <shoky> and then you can do from somewhere else:  defaultApp.Settings.fetchSettings().done(function(data) { ... });
[09:21:11] <shoky> Raydiation:  i meant, settings.prototype.fetchSettings = function(){ return $.getJSON(this.settingsUrl) };
[09:21:19] <shoky> (when i said you can return it)
[09:23:15] <Raydiation> shoky: and because of function application i can easily add a callback to the return?
[09:23:33] <Raydiation> s/return/returned function/
[09:24:21] <shoky> Raydiation: not sure if i understood you, but yea, you can add as many callbacks as you want this way
[09:26:27] <Raydiation> shoky:  i mean: myfunc = function("hi", param){};  myfunc("param2");
[09:26:29] <sonnie> jammsen: i just googled a JSON 2 HTML. studying on it, you can try it
[09:26:56] <shoky> Raydiation: not sure what you're doing there..
[09:27:18] <shoky> function("hi",param){}  ?
[09:27:23] <jammsen> sonnie: ty
[09:30:31] <Raydiation> shoky: the first parameter is already given
[09:31:20] <Raydiation> would be better to write: param1 = "hi"; myfunc = function(param1, param2){}(param1); myfunc("param2");
[09:31:30] <Raydiation> i guess that makes more sense if i got it right
[09:32:40] <shoky> Raydiation: i dont see how this has to do with what we were talking about, but you can also do that with javascript's 'bind'
[09:33:24] <Raydiation> shoky: i mean the getJSON function also expects a callback, so you give it only the first parameter, return the function and the give it the second parameter
[09:33:34] <Raydiation> then*
[09:33:35] <shoky> Raydiation: you dont have to supply the callback to it
[09:33:41] <shoky> Raydiation: http://jsfiddle.net/UvpCV/
[09:34:06] <Raydiation> shoky: yes, i dont have to
[09:34:08] <shoky> Raydiation: and i still donno what you mean
[09:34:18] <shoky> what result are you looking for
[09:36:31] <defaultro> how do you call an url via event click? I think window.location is javascript syntax and not jquery
[09:36:40] <Raydiation> shoky: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/UvpCV/1/
[09:37:14] <brettfrable> anyone here have access to ie7?
[09:37:14] <bot-t> (28 mins 10 secs ago) <shoky> tell brettfrable need to call .draggable() again http://jsfiddle.net/5haMZ/1/
[09:37:38] <Raydiation> shoky: not sure if this works though
[09:37:42] <brettfrable> thanks shoky
[09:37:42] <shoky> Raydiation: xhr is the return value of $.getJSON, it's not $.getJSON itself
[09:37:45] <brettfrable> figured it out
[09:38:06] <shoky> Raydiation: it's not a function, it's a jqXHR object
[09:38:08] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/5haMZ/1/ - have any idea why that width resize isn't working in ie7 though
[09:38:11] <brettfrable> or how i can fix it.
[09:38:15] <brettfrable> need it to work in ie7
[09:38:30] <Raydiation> shoky: ok, so this doesnt work like functional programming
[09:38:43] <shoky> Raydiation: not this specific instance no..
[09:38:56] <Raydiation> ty
[09:39:30] <Raydiation> shoky: maybe you could return a closure taking the callback param
[09:39:49] <shoky> Raydiation: you could do many things. what do you WANT to happen..
[09:40:36] <Raydiation> shoky: im just trying to understand :)
[09:40:49] <shoky> then read the docs ;)
[09:41:02] <shoky> read about $.ajax, and about deferreds/promises
[09:41:16] <Raydiation> ok
[09:41:27] <shoky> Raydiation: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[09:43:15] <sunbeam> I have an input field, the default value should dissapear when i click in it, and when nothing is filled in, it should be back again.. any idea how I can do this best?
[09:43:30] <defaultro> why can't we apply click event to element <li>?
[09:43:46] <shoky> defaultro: you can handle click events on <li>'s ..
[09:44:16] <SP33D> can some one help me with a logical problem
[09:44:17] <defaultro> actuallly, it worked after i added class to it
[09:44:30] <shoky> SP33D: ask
[09:44:48] <SP33D> i use jquery to modify code
[09:44:49] <defaultro> why it doesn't work when I call it like this -> $(li).click(function() .......
[09:45:03] <SP33D> like this $('div.boxText a:contains("Base")').text('Base <img src="http://linuscom.de/images/product_images/thumbnail_images/8_0.png"/>');
[09:45:15] <shoky> defaultro:  $('li').click(..
[09:45:16] <defaultro> oh, looks like it worked when I added quotes
[09:45:18] <defaultro> yeah
[09:45:19] <SP33D> but the page gets randered with clear text
[09:45:20] <shoky> duh :P
[09:45:30] <SP33D> it don't gets interpreted by the browser as img
[09:45:32] <SP33D> like it should
[09:45:36] <defaultro> k
[09:45:59] <shoky> SP33D: you probably want .html()  not .text()
[09:46:01] <defaultro> so I shoudl always put quotes around elements then
[09:46:08] <SP33D> ah ok thx a lot
[09:46:09] <SP33D> ^^
[09:46:30] <shoky> defaultro:  when you say  $(li)   that means call the function called $ and pass li as a parameter
[09:46:47] <defaultro> ok
[09:46:52] <shoky> and li is not defined
[09:46:56] <defaultro> maybe if you can give me an example, that will help a lot
[09:47:01] <shoky> you want to pass a selector string
[09:47:05] <shoky> strings are enclosed in quotes
[09:47:20] <shoky> example?  $('li')
[09:47:23] <defaultro> but my html is <li>Text 1</li>
[09:47:26] <shoky> so?
[09:47:26] <SP33D> thx works as expect thx a lot
[09:47:27] <SP33D> :D
[09:47:43] <shoky> defaultro: you need to pass a selector STRING to jQuery function
[09:47:47] <Raydiation> hm i see, you have to implement currying and partial application by yourself for every function http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/currying-and-partial-functions-in-javasc/231001821?pgno=2
[09:47:49] <defaultro> because the other day,I saw a code like this, $(p).someevent
[09:48:03] <shoky> defaultro: that is also wrong, unless there was a variable called p already defined
[09:48:14] <defaultro> k
[09:50:14] <shoky> Raydiation: you can use .bind  like i told you
[09:50:57] <defaultro> shoky, different topic. I was given a code last week. I'm sure it's going to be tough for me. How do I start reverse engineering the code? I mean, he told me everything is in index.php. I saw all the js files he included. However, where should I start with stepping over?
[09:51:49] <defaultro> also, I wanted to know which javascript file takes answers the events when I click on the webpage
[09:51:52] <shoky> defaultro: that is too general ;) it'd depend on what the app is, where its main functionality lies, what you need to do with/to the app, etc..
[09:51:53] <defaultro> how do I find that?
[09:52:10] <voot545> I have a large amount of span elements that use the mouseup event, and it seems that the first time I click on the span, there's a noticable delay of around 400ms for the mouseup event to trigger, but consecutive clicks on the same element then go to a normal lag of around 50 or 100ms; is there any way to reduce the lag time for the first click? (only on firefox, chrome doesn't have this issue
[09:52:11] <voot545> and fires immediately)
[09:52:39] <defaultro> i'm having a hard time with firebug. I doesn't say which file was called
[09:52:46] <xorAxAx> hi, i wrote a webapp and the title tag is emptied by it without me touching it explicitly. it is heavily using $.ajax. this emptying only happens on FX, not on chrome
[09:52:48] <xorAxAx> any idea?
[09:52:55] <shoky> defaultro: there are many ways to tackle that.. chrome developer tools gives you lots of handy stuff.. you can check event listeners on elements, you can record in the timeline while clicking and see exactly what happened
[09:53:10] <defaultro> shoky, is it better than firebug?
[09:53:25] <shoky> defaultro: if you're interested in jquery events there's this handy bookmarklet:  http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CFEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprymedia.co.uk%2Farticle%2FVisual%2BEvent%2B2&ei=gWoVULzuGsyY1AXpxoHgDg&usg=AFQjCNETVuALbFImbVtnBWlMKMbslaISqg&sig2=PKZaVyCRiXfJj_BqYm1csQ
[09:53:27] <shoky> oops
[09:53:32] <defaultro> :D
[09:53:33] <shoky> i meant: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[09:53:49] <defaultro> thanks a lot, reading it now
[09:53:50] <shoky> defaultro: i like it much better than firebug, yes. and it has more stuff
[09:54:00] <codepython777> Anyone can tell me what i'm doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/2/ ?
[09:54:12] <codepython777> I want to call a function with how many stars were clicked on
[09:54:26] <shoky> there's html in your javascript, for starters
[09:54:36] <ravenzz> codelahoma the script tag is not required there
[09:54:53] <defaultro> awesome shoky! I will install chrome :D
[09:55:08] <shoky> codepython777: also you did $('#stars5')  but there is no element with that ID.
[09:55:11] <mercenary> shoky is the father of JS
[09:55:12] <shoky> come on :\
[09:55:15] <defaultro> Ihope this visual event can be installed inWindows
[09:55:26] <shoky> defaultro: it has no installation, it's a simple bookmarklet
[09:55:29] <ravenzz> codepython777 sorry
[09:55:40] <shoky> defaultro: it runs on chrome, any OS
[09:55:46] <shoky> defaultro: probably firefox too
[09:55:48] <ravenzz> and the id is star5
[09:55:53] <defaultro> oh, so there is no need for me to do in CHrome?
[09:56:50] <shoky> defaultro: the Visual Event thing? it'll work in firefox too i think, but in chrome it'll also show you source file and line number where the functions were defined
[09:57:05] <defaultro> ok
[09:57:12] <shoky> defaultro: but if you're serious about webdev and wanna learn, and need to reverse engineer this app, definitely install chrome right away
[09:57:17] <defaultro> from what i am reading right now, looks like I need to add a code?
[09:57:23] <shoky> you dont need to add anything
[09:57:28] <defaultro> oh ok
[09:57:31] <shoky> you just need to add that bookmarklet as a bookmark
[09:57:34] <shoky> and go to your site
[09:57:40] <defaultro> i just need to learn how the webapp works written by the other team
[09:57:42] <shoky> and then go to that bookmark while you're on your site
[09:57:48] <defaultro> ok
[09:57:49] <shoky> and it'll load the shiz
[09:57:59] <defaultro> chrome installed :)
[09:58:38] <shoky> enjoy
[09:58:43] <defaultro> ok, I will experiment
[09:58:55] <defaultro> i will check what bookmarklet is :P
[09:59:02] <shoky> defaultro oh and if you haven't seen this then definitely do: see ?ftj

[09:59:16] <defaultro> wow
[09:59:21] <defaultro> that is goign to help me a lot for sure
[09:59:24] <shoky> ;]
[09:59:33] <defaultro> thank you so much!!! :D
[09:59:48] <shoky> yw
[09:59:52] <defaultro> i've been studying jquery daily but still having a hard time
[10:00:16] <defaultro> my boss told me to look for classroom based trainings. Found one but he rejected it due to cost
[10:00:59] <defaultro> the one in Bocoup also got rejected due to the training location, it's from another state
[10:01:00] <shoky> bosses :@
[10:01:15] <defaultro> lodging, airfare and training
[10:01:20] <shoky> ah bitovi was too pricy?
[10:01:35] <defaultro> yes
[10:01:40] <shoky> bosses :@:@
[10:01:56] <sunbeam> I have an input field, the default value should dissapear when i click in it, and when nothing is filled in, it should be back again.. any idea how I can do this best?
[10:02:16] <defaultro> focusin and blur
[10:02:29] <defaultro> then display: none
[10:02:47] <defaultro> then do the opposite. That's my guess but I'm very new to this
[10:02:57] <defaultro> shoky, is my suggestion to sunbeam right?
[10:03:19] <shoky> well, not display: none :P he just wants the text to disappear
[10:03:29] <defaultro> oh ok
[10:03:39] <shoky> and regarding focusin/blur that's probably the way to go but i'd need to test it to be sure
[10:04:00] <defaultro> i just wrote one example last night during my learning, hehehe
[10:04:20] <defaultro> $(':text').focusin and $(':text').blur
[10:04:33] <defaultro> i'm learning, hehehe
[10:04:36] <codepython777> shoky: thanks. http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/4/ -- how do i get the number of stars clicked? How do i set the initial number of stars?
[10:04:48] <shoky> ;P
[10:05:16] <sunbeam> ok
[10:05:44] <defaultro> shoky, going back to Chrome, how do I add it as a bookmarklet? :P
[10:06:23] <shoky> defaultro: just add it as a bookmark ;P  drag it to your bookmarks bar
[10:06:38] <shoky> (or click the star)
[10:06:58] <shoky> codepython777: i think you just need to have the inputs checked
[10:07:03] <defaultro> oh :)
[10:07:38] <defaultro> bookmarked. So all I do now is browse our app. Later, how do I view the events?
[10:08:45] <codepython777> shoky: jsfiddle please?
[10:08:48] <shoky> codepython777: sorry , i mean you need to check the radio box
[10:09:28] <shoky> codepython777: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/5/
[10:10:03] <AngryMan> Hi can anyone tell me what this is ? http://pastebin.com/KF0Kba5Y
[10:10:12] <shoky> defaultro: go to your app, then click the bookmark
[10:10:16] <AngryMan> What stuff is it in the "data" variable
[10:10:18] <defaultro> i did
[10:10:28] <defaultro> it's been bookmarked
[10:10:34] <shoky> defaultro: what did you bookmark? the website itself?
[10:10:42] <defaultro> my webapp
[10:10:45] <shoky> uhh
[10:10:47] <shoky> no
[10:10:51] <shoky> go to http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[10:10:55] <defaultro> oh ok, lol :D
[10:11:10] <shoky> then where it says 'Make it go!' , it says:  Drag the "Visual Event" link on the right to your bookmark bar: Visual Event
[10:11:17] <defaultro> k
[10:11:18] <shoky> so drag that link  :P
[10:11:22] <shoky> that's the bookmarklet
[10:11:40] <defaultro> how does the bookmark bar looks like? where is it?
[10:12:00] <defaultro> is it the same area where we type urls?
[10:12:13] <shoky> it should be right under the url bar
[10:12:19] <shoky> if it's not there, ctrl-shift-b
[10:12:23] <shoky> should make it appear
[10:12:24] <defaultro> oh, that's why
[10:12:32] <defaultro> now it's there
[10:12:35] <defaultro> dragging it nw
[10:12:35] <shoky> cool
[10:12:42] <defaultro> i see it now
[10:12:47] <defaultro> what's next?
[10:12:57] <defaultro> I see Visual Event btw
[10:13:06] <shoky> now just go to your app, then click the bookmark in the bookmarks bar
[10:13:08] <shoky> of Visual Event
[10:13:12] <shoky> that you just added ;P
[10:13:14] <defaultro> got it
[10:13:24] <codepython777> shoky: thanks
[10:13:45] <defaultro> it displayed red thingy on top left
[10:13:55] <defaultro> it also changed the looks of my webapp
[10:14:15] <defaultro> similar to firefox's inspect element
[10:14:34] <defaultro> so this can now listen to mouse clicks?
[10:16:30] <shoky> AngryMan: that's base64 encoding
[10:16:42] <shoky> AngryMan: there's HTML in that data
[10:16:54] <shoky> AngryMan: paste it here if you want http://www.base64decode.org/
[10:16:59] <AngryMan> oh ok
[10:17:02] <AngryMan> thanks
[10:17:12] <defaultro> shoky, looks like if I want to see the event, I will have to bring up the form then load Visual Event after it. Am I right?
[10:17:26] <shoky> defaultro: i suppose..
[10:17:46] <defaultro> k
[10:17:47] <hoolter> how do dual interdependent var declarations work? var $this = $(this), x = doSomethingWith($this);
[10:18:09] <shoky> defaultro: but .. you may wanna just look through the code.. figure out what the main parts are, etc.. before you start using tooling like that
[10:18:30] <defaultro> k
[10:18:34] <hoolter> is $this already defined by the time i try to doSomethingWith(it), or does it only get its value after the ';'?
[10:19:37] <shoky> hoolter: it gets its value right after that assignment expression is done (so its already defined & evaluated by the time you call doSomethingWith
[10:19:38] <shoky> )
[10:20:22] <shoky> hoolter: also i wouldn't call that dual interdependent.. the second one depends on the first, that's it
[10:20:37] <AngryMan> shoky: Is it best practice to return HTML in JSON in base64 encoded format?
[10:20:44] <AngryMan> What happens when I return raw html
[10:21:02] <defaultro> shoky, I just found one very intersting click event. inside the function, it calls, mr.control.map.clickmode.addobjecttooltipapplication('report',''); How do I find out what javascript file is that?
[10:21:16] <shoky> AngryMan: uhh HTML is fine
[10:22:23] <shoky> raw HTML, that is
[10:22:30] <AngryMan> okay. thanks.
[10:22:33] <defaultro> it's generated
[10:22:46] <hoolter> shoky: right on.
[10:22:55] <defaultro> you mean, already created?
[10:22:59] <shoky> defaultro: i donno man, i hardly used that bookmarklet. it's time for you to stop asking and start poking around ;)
[10:23:42] <defaultro> :D
[10:24:22] <defaultro> i found it from  5 different js files
[10:24:33] <shoky> that's a start ;)
[10:27:52] <defaultro> is this an array or object? var mr = {};
[10:28:44] <shoky> object
[10:28:51] <shoky> [] is array
[10:29:24] <defaultro> thanks
[10:30:12] <x86> I'm looking for an example of pushing content to a client based on a server-side event... I've read a little on JQuery / WebSockets (I am already using HTML5 and JQuery anyway)... are WebSockets the best approach?
[10:31:43] <KeyLimePi> hello.... Im trying to parse 2 things in a popup alert.  1) "You are using" and 2) the jquery version number (parsed from (jQuery().jquery) .  Anyone know how to get it to parse instead of reading as "You are using (jQuery().jquery) " ?
[10:32:36] <defaultro> shoky, I just noticed that Visual Event is working in Firefox. I just went to a webpage and the events got displayed automatically
[10:43:27] <t432> what will be the correct datatype to include in ajax call if server returns a byte[]?
[10:45:21] <lotus> t432: an array of characters?
[10:45:27] <lotus> t432: like... a string?
[10:45:45] <t432> array of characters
[10:45:53] <lotus> t432: never thought of using a byte array with jquery :)
[10:47:02] <t432> i have a function in server that returns an image in a byte[]
[10:47:15] <codepython777> How do i figure out what $(this) selected? and inspect it?
[10:47:55] <lotus> t432: you could json encode the byte array if you need it like that.  You could also just send down the image
[10:49:06] <t432> i need a jquery formated version of following nested divs anyone have a link ? http://pastebin.com/ikkmH6ah
[10:49:24] <trailbar> i'm using a lib using jquery 1.4.2 - can i just check did console.log work in this or not? saw a google link that said it might not
[10:49:24] <lotus> t432: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/loading-image-with-ajax might help you
[10:50:00] <lotus> trailbar: console.log is independent of jquery -- it's browser based.  Do you mean typing "jQuery" into a console?
[10:50:47] <lotus> t432: you can use .children()  and .each() http://api.jquery.com/children/  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:53:57] <trailbar> lotus: ah ok - who knows what i mean :]
[10:54:21] <trailbar> guess thats not my problem then - thanks
[10:58:46] <abletony84> I'm trying to switch images when one hovers the thumbnails: http://jsfiddle.net/6RknE/2/
[10:58:49] <abletony84> But how do I load all images in the beginning instead so there's not that delay as each of them loads? I also hear it's better for SEO: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/6RknE/5/
[11:00:21] <ionico> hi
[11:03:45] <ionico> i have an input with a class name, that class name gives the input some style, but also when click on it triggers some javascript code,  and it works perfect. the problem is when i get that input from a server side processing json, it show the input, also the style, but it doesnt execute the javascript function,  what can it be?
[11:20:54] <abletony84> I'm trying to switch images when one hovers the thumbnails like at http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/w4m/3169737958.html except I'd like to load all the images from the getgo so there's no delay or whatever.
[11:20:58] <abletony84> What I got so far is kinda messy though - http://jsfiddle.net/6RknE/8/ - anybody know a prettier way of achieving this?
[11:31:09] <t432> lotus: will ".children()" work even when I am trying populate multiple divs e.g. the pastbin you saw will have multiple those divs?
[11:32:04] <t432> hope that made sense
[11:32:05] <t432> :)
[11:35:42] <codepython777> shoky: Whats the correct way of calculating "i" in JS for this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/9/ ?
[11:42:12] <shoky> codepython777: i = $(".rating input[name=rating]:checked").val();
[11:43:09] <codepython777> Git it, thanks
[11:43:30] <codepython777> got
[11:43:54] <abletony84> At this "switch images when one hovers the thumbnails" clone of http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/w4m/3169737958.html - http://jsfiddle.net/6RknE/8/ - is there a way to use CSS selectors instead of IDs to achieve cleaner code?
[11:50:42] <syborg> abletony84: try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/WmvFF/1/
[11:54:08] <mdunham918_> I know this is a css question but can anyone explain why this happens: http://jsfiddle.net/2VexH/ the only difference is i set z-index: 1 on the container of the bottom divs....
[11:54:36] <t432> can you use .children() to append stuff?
[11:56:50] <abletony84> syborg: awesome man!
[11:58:06] <abletony84> syborg: wait hold up $('.photos .big-thumbnails li:nth-of-type(' + i + ')').addClass('active');
[11:58:28] <abletony84> doesnt look too good though hehe
[11:58:41] <abletony84> syborg: thanks a lot im gonna go with this one.. bless!
[12:05:28] <lathan> mdunham918_, Z-index is sensitive to the type of position, if you change the position type, the z-index works relative to others of the same position. play around with it with this url: http://www.css-101.org/z-index/playground.php
[12:06:11] <lathan> t432, .children() is a selector....if you want to append something to an element's children, then yes. otherwise just... $('div').append('...')
[12:09:06] <mdunham918_> lathan: thats where i'm confused ohhhh wait a minute
[12:12:04] <lathan> mdunham918_, your div:before is position:relative and your div is position:absolute
[12:18:42] <walidvb> hi guys! i'm using $.get() to get smth from a url, the url is working(i can load it), it does return what is expected(content exists in $.get().response), but ajax request fails.
[12:18:47] <lathan> mdunham918_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3032856/z-index-of-before-or-after-to-be-below-the-element-is-that-possibale
[12:19:06] <lathan> bot-t: are you there?
[12:19:06] <bot-t> lathan, As I see it, yes.
[12:19:07] <walidvb> i can't seem to understand why, at all.
[12:19:16] <mdunham918_> i figured it out http://jsfiddle.net/uMUZc/5/
[12:19:18] <lathan> ?jsfiddle @ walidvb
[12:19:18] <bot-t> walidvb, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[12:19:25] <lathan> yay bot-t is back!
[12:20:36] <lathan> mdunham918_, what browsers did you test it in?
[12:20:45] <lathan> mdunham918_, it is unlikely that this will work in all browser
[12:21:01] <lathan> s
[12:21:05] <mdunham918_> hmm it should work all the way back to ie8
[12:21:11] <mdunham918_> havne't tested though
[12:22:07] <lathan> mdunham918_, I've got a quote from a css spec that says :after and :before should act like a child element....and its hard to get a child element to z-index behind its parent with all compatability...just check it
[12:22:18] <walidvb> i'll fiddle it, but even doing a simple jQuery.get(url, function(r){console.log(r)}) first returns the XMLHttpRequest, then gives an error(i attached a console.log to ajaxerror)
[12:22:38] <lathan> walidvb, oh wow...sorry....you can't jsfiddle testing an ajax request
[12:22:44] <lathan> ?p
[12:22:44] <mdunham918_> lathan: i didn't put it behind
[12:22:44] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:23:15] <mdunham918_> lathan: i figured my problem was due to the z-index of before acting as a child of the container which would always be on top no mater what
[12:23:25] <mdunham918_> so i added an after to act as the background worked great
[12:23:26] <walidvb> lathan: i think it does mimic a server for ajax requests, no?
[12:23:47] <lathan> mdunham918_, ah....yes..after would be easier
[12:23:54] <walidvb> but that's not really the point here. What i don't get, is that i had this working, and somehow i must have changed smth, and it stopped working
[12:24:04] <lathan> walidvb, yah.....but difficult...if you want you can...just put it up on a pastee or someplace
[12:24:25] <walidvb> (working locally with MAMP)
[12:24:37] <lathan> walidvb, if you want to fiddle it with their echo ajax calls go ahead
[12:24:45] <walidvb> lathan: jQuery.get('post/1');
[12:24:53] <walidvb> this is what i run
[12:25:01] <lathan> walidvb, and then you just start running of the xhr ?
[12:25:11] <lathan> why not use the callbacks in jQuery ? @ walidvb
[12:25:28] <walidvb> sry not familiar with ajax jargon
[12:25:40] <lathan> xhr...xhtml request oject
[12:25:48] <walidvb> ok
[12:25:58] <lathan> walidvb, if you save the result of jQuery.get(...) that is an xhr
[12:26:18] <lathan> walidvb, check this page out....http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:26:22] <walidvb> i did
[12:26:30] <lathan> walidvb, you probably want the $.ajax example so you can also have an error function
[12:26:32] <walidvb> so u say use a callback in the get(url, handler)
[12:28:08] <walidvb> lathan: the problem is that jQuery.get() fails(or at least doesn't act as if it would succeed)
[12:28:44] <lathan> walidvb, that is why you want to use the full ajax syntax,  see simple non-working example: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Nu2VL/
[12:29:16] <lathan> walidvb, it will call success or error. (and afterward it will call a complete function if you give it)
[12:29:56] <walidvb> lathan: will try that. but shouldn't $.get work? or rather, how could i debug it?
[12:32:40] <abletony84> syborg: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/WmvFF/10/ that's it i think
[12:36:48] <M1k1> what is return false?
[12:37:32] <walidvb> ?seen lathan
[12:37:32] <b-ot> walidvb, I saw lathan 46s ago, leaving #jquery.

[12:38:47] <walidvb> how can i debug an ajax request?
[12:39:17] <libryder> walidvb: have you ever used console.log?
[12:39:22] <walidvb> i am trying to load the url='/paramdesign/post/4' , which does exist and is a json format
[12:39:33] <walidvb> libryder: ...yes... ;P
[12:39:35] <libryder> pass the response object into console.log and you can see it in the console
[12:39:49] <walidvb> libryder: but the ajax call fails
[12:39:58] <walidvb> so i don't have the response object
[12:40:02] <libryder> yes you do
[12:40:32] <libryder> in chrome, pull up web developer and look under network, and filter by XHR on the bottom
[12:41:01] <walidvb> however, when i run $.get(url), an XMLHttpRequest is returned, then the ajaxfailed event is triggered
[12:41:26] <walidvb> libryder: thanks i didn't know this
[12:41:38] <walidvb> lemme look into it a bit hopefully i can sort it our
[12:41:40] <walidvb> out*
[12:41:54] <libryder> walidvb: http://i49.tinypic.com/2ppg47b.png you can also add a failure hook to your ajax call
[12:43:41] <libryder> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/	"complete callbacks fire, in the order they are registered, when the request finishes, whether in failure or success. They receive the jqXHR object, as well as a string containing the success or error code."
[12:45:39] <walidvb> libryder: i use 1.4.4, i believe jqXHR was introduced later
[12:46:25] <walidvb> libryder: i get this: http://cl.ly/image/172W0r0d2u12
[12:46:43] <libryder> click on preview
[12:47:55] <walidvb> libryder: yup, my data is there
[12:48:11] <libryder> so what's the problem?
[12:48:14] <walidvb> libryder: working locally on MAMP, if that's any help
[12:48:20] <relipse> How do I iterate through a list of <li> elements, and know the index number of that specific <li>
[12:48:21] <libryder> a 200 means the call was successful
[12:48:29] <walidvb> the problem is success function is never called
[12:48:34] <walidvb> but i agree with you
[12:49:29] <walidvb> indeed, settings.error is ran
[12:50:09] <libryder> can you gist your code?
[12:50:23] <relipse> I need to iterate through a bunch of <li> elements and know the individual li index, how do I do that
[12:50:58] <walidvb> libryder: which exactly? i simply run from console, but here you go:
[12:51:30] <walidvb> https://gist.github.com/05415c11aa69d413dc58
[12:52:02] <libryder> walidvb: you aren't getting a response in the console at all?
[12:52:46] <walidvb> libryder: i am getting this: http://cl.ly/image/2b3N0a1K3C39
[12:53:05] <walidvb> ('get failed' is from a handler attached to ajaxfailed)
[12:53:27] <libryder> what's inside the XMLHttpRequest object?
[12:53:46] <libryder> relipse: what do you mean "index" ?
[12:54:04] <walidvb> libryder: the response expected :D
[12:54:16] <walidvb> and status 200
[12:55:29] <libryder> walidvb: try this https://gist.github.com/4d6a6ecc48c182191ca1
[12:56:35] <walidvb> libryder: aha parseerror
[12:56:51] <walidvb> invalid json. thanks.
[12:57:04] <libryder> woot
[12:57:17] <walidvb> very weird cause drupal is generating my json
[12:57:37] <walidvb> but cheers. i'll look into it later, gotta eat now, girlfriend is getting nervous ;)

[13:26:28] <TorpedoSkyline> mercenary got that? Head out if you want to advertise.
[13:26:49] <mercenary> are you a God on this channel, Nissan?
[13:27:25] <TorpedoSkyline> mercenary, I will not hesitate to contact the operators on this. Your IP address is easily accessible and you very well may be banned.
[13:27:49] <ionico> i have an input with a class name, that class name gives the input some style, but also when click on it triggers some javascript code,  and it works perfect. the problem is when i get that input from a server side processing json, it show the input, also the style, but it doesnt execute the javascript function,  what can it be?
[13:28:12] <mercenary> listen Nissan, I like skyline's too, but I'll tell you this only once: DO NOT GET IN MY WAY WHEN I AM HUNGRY AND WITH NO MONEY!
[13:28:35] <johnkpaul> ionico: you'll need to rebind the even thandlers
[13:28:38] <johnkpaul> or use event delegation
[13:28:48] <TorpedoSkyline> mercenary, let me help you out. I'd try eLance
[13:29:07] <johnkpaul> TorpedoSkyline: you have mercenary's ear in the right channel, talk there
[13:29:22] <TorpedoSkyline> Yes, sorry johnkpaul
[13:29:37] <ionico> thanks johnkpaul, but i´m newbie, can you tell me more ?
[13:29:55] <ionico> what do you mena with rebind the even thandlers
[13:30:02] <johnkpaul> ionico: sure, so you have some code that adds event handlers, like $('input').click(functionThatRunsWhenClickHappens)
[13:30:06] <johnkpaul> right, ionico?
[13:32:36] <ionico> yes
[13:33:04] <ionico> i have a function the way you mention
[13:33:14] <johnkpaul> so ionico, you're adding new input tags, but clicking on them does not trigger the same handler
[13:33:46] <johnkpaul> thats because, the new input tags that you are adding to the dom, do not have the event handlers attached
[13:35:12] <johnkpaul> ?on @ionico
[13:35:12] <bot-t> ionico, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:35:51] <ionico> johnkpaul thanks a lot!
[13:35:54] <johnkpaul> ionico: read those docs, especially the section titled "Direct and delegated events"
[13:36:16] <johnkpaul> ionico: no problem, have fun!
[13:36:25] <TechieShane> Can anyone help me with an issue I have in jQuery mobile
[13:36:28] <TechieShane> it's quite urgent
[13:36:57] <johnkpaul> ?ask @ TechieShane
[13:36:58] <bot-t> TechieShane, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:37:12] <TechieShane> ok
[13:37:22] <TechieShane> http://jsfiddle.net/4K56p/
[13:37:42] <TechieShane> How do I align "Available" and 12/12/12 to the very right of the tab just before the arrow
[13:38:29] <johnkpaul> TechieShane: this is a css/html question
[13:38:37] <johnkpaul> not at all related to jquery mobile
[13:38:42] <TechieShane> okay
[13:38:50] <johnkpaul> you need to set a width on the first column
[13:38:57] <johnkpaul> in your table
[13:39:59] <johnkpaul> tbh, I don't know much more details and I'd just end up playing around with values, tables are pretty foreign to me nowadays, you should ask #css
[13:50:58] <hoolter> could anyone help me compile some quick jade?  jsbin's not effing working.
[13:51:57] <mercenary> hoolter why do you wanna do that?
[13:52:21] <hoolter> so i don't have to translate it by hand?
[13:52:27] <hoolter> mercenary: do u have a working compiler?
[13:52:51] <mercenary> :(
[13:52:54] <mercenary> I have C++
[13:55:06] <hoolter1> mercenary: u know why this isn't rendering properly? http://jsbin.com/evoyoc/1/edit
[13:55:55] <mercenary> :( no
[13:56:00] <mercenary> is this your website jsbin.com?
[13:56:44] <hoolter1> mercenary: no, not at all. it's remy sharp''s
[13:56:55] <mercenary> great :D
[14:00:02] <jammsen> mercenary: hoolter1: for what is this site? http://jsbin.com javascript pasting?
[14:00:15] <jammsen> dont load at my side :(
[14:00:37] <hoolter1> jammsen: yeah sometimes it doesn't work right. what browser u using?
[14:00:48] <jammsen> current FF
[14:01:50] <hoolter1> jammsen: it's very nice when it works.
[14:02:27] <jammsen> i try chrome, one sec
[14:03:14] <jammsen> hoolter1   in chrome i see just a figure with a js bumper
[14:03:26] <jammsen> no html, nothing at all
[14:05:17] <hoolter1> jammsen: when it works its like a cooler jsfiddle.
[14:08:07] <jammsen> hoolter1: masked html? is that right? or a typo?
[14:09:40] <hoolter1> masked?
[14:09:45] <hoolter1> jade-lang.com
[14:10:43] <vmasto> hello, quick question, is there any way to have a function option as a variable? (sample code: http://jsfiddle.net/CGdLm/1/)
[14:11:06] <jammsen> hoolter1: oh its a template engine for node.js?
[14:13:17] <vmasto> anyone?
[14:13:18] <vmasto> :)
[14:14:57] <jammsen> vmasto: you dont pay for the answer, just wait if someone reacts :)
[14:15:29] <vmasto> jammsen: yes I know sorry I didn't mean to sound rude
[14:15:30] <vmasto> :>
[14:18:58] <ali1234> why does jquery and javascript use so much anonymous functions everywhere?
[14:20:58] <rodd> they like to keep their privacy
[14:21:38] <harleypig> I'm trying to use $.getJSON but chrome's debugger is telling me "Uncaught TypeError: Object function $(element) { ... } has no method 'getJSON'" The '...' is code I haven't written. Any pointers?
[14:21:58] <harleypig> I'm sure the JSON being returned is correct and has the application/json content-type.
[14:23:08] <harleypig> But I don't think that's it.  If I put in garbage for the url I get the same uncaught exception.
[14:24:58] <shoky> ?p @ harleypig
[14:24:58] <bot-t> harleypig, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:26:46] <harleypig> shoky: Would a link to the site I'm developing be ok?
[14:27:08] <shoky> harleypig: yeah, but just show how you're calling getJSON
[14:27:21] <shoky> (first of all..)
[14:28:47] <harleypig> http://jsfiddle.net/xkWHG/
[14:28:58] <shoky> vmasto: http://jsfiddle.net/CGdLm/2/
[14:29:26] <harleypig> and the site is http://finddate.harleydev.com (it's a future date calculator, not a softporn site)
[14:30:16] <shoky> harleypig:  $ is not jQuery (in your site)
[14:30:42] <harleypig> ? How?
[14:30:43] <bot-t> harleypig, Tutorials:How jQuery Works - A basic introduction to jQuery and the concepts that you need to know to use it. http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[14:31:02] <shoky> harleypig: because you are also including prototype
[14:31:15] <harleypig> oh
[14:31:25] <harleypig> reading
[14:31:46] <harleypig> so, $( elementname ) is not the same as $?
[14:32:07] <harleypig> well, I mean, obviously it isn't exactly the same ...
[14:32:57] <shoky> harleypig,  both jQuery and prototype use the same variable name,  $
[14:33:18] <shoky> harleypig: in your site, after loading, $ references prototype's namespace, not jquery's
[14:33:24] <harleypig> oic
[14:33:44] <harleypig> so, if I replace $.getJSON with ( jQuery ).getJSON ?
[14:33:44] <shoky> so  whether you say $ or $( elementname ) , it won't be referring to jquery
[14:33:52] <shoky> jQuery.getJSON
[14:34:11] <shoky> normally, $ === jQuery
[14:34:15] <harleypig> ohhhh ... so, everywhere I'm using $(...) I'm really using prototype?
[14:34:25] <shoky> i dunno , could be ;)
[14:34:29] <harleypig> :D
[14:34:37] <shoky> i dont really know prototype
[14:36:40] <harleypig> *sigh* looks like I need to just bite the bullet and get rid of prototype and get it all working under jquery
[14:37:13] <libryder> YES!
[14:37:17] <libryder> *rapid clap*
[14:37:39] <libryder> prototype is dead. and i work in it way more than i would like, which is none
[14:37:51] <shoky> harleypig: there should be a way in prototype to make it not conflict with other libs
[14:38:16] <shoky> in jquery for example you can say:   $ = jQuery.noConflict();   and then use $ knowing that it is jQuery
[14:38:40] <shoky> er but also it makes it so jquery doesnt hijack the global $ name
[14:39:31] <harleypig> I don't know why I started using prototype (this is an on again off again project for a friend) but I've got some tuits and I need to learn jquery anyway.
[14:39:44] <harleypig> libryder: :D
[14:42:30] <textchimp> hi, i've got .live('hover') functions set up for a particular div-1 element, and also for a div-2 element which is its next() sibling. div-2  is a little menu icon which is displayed on the hover event of div-1. But when i hover over div-2 (to make a menu appear), the div-1 hover out event fires - though in a way the mouse is still 'over' div-1, since div-2 is floating above div-1. how do i make the div-1 hover out event not happen?
[14:42:45] <textchimp> what i actually get is a kind of flickering as all these hover in/out events fire
[14:43:22] <libryder> textchimp: check this out http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:43:34] <textchimp> sorry about the phrasing, i can't really give a jsfiddle example for this
[14:44:20] <libryder> i prefer putting "return false" at the bottom of my method hooks, but stopPropagation works too
[14:44:32] <vmasto> shoky: thanks a lot mate :)
[14:46:19] <textchimp> ok
[14:47:21] <textchimp> libryder, i'm trying it in a few places, and none of them seem to be helping with the flickering hover stuff. not sure where it should go, so that the hover events of the div-2 icon have no effect on the div-1 sitting behind it
[14:49:05] <libryder> textchimp: it sounds like you are going to have to enable and disable those events as the mouse moves into the different divs
[14:50:51] <textchimp> libryder, but the div-1 hover out event fires before the div-2 icon hover in event, so how do i know when to disable it?
[14:52:03] <textchimp> if the div-2 icon is actually a child of div-1 instead of a sibling, will that stop the div-1 events from firing when i hover over div-2?
[14:52:39] <libryder> i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what you're doing
[14:52:59] <textchimp> i know, it's not really clear
[14:53:13] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to place the cursor on a text field but not with .focus(), I mean, not to force the user to stay there?
[14:53:46] <textchimp> div1 has an image thumbnail in it - when it's hovered, a small icon appears in the top left corner of the image, and when that icon is hovered over, a menu should roll down
[15:02:32] <noregret> for validation plugin users, how can i validate onblur for each field ?
[15:18:34] <Es0teric> question - who uses bootstrap here
[15:18:34] <Es0teric> ?
[15:24:02] <nessaja> Hello
[15:24:22] <FernandoBasso> I can't seem to compare $(this).name == 'some_string'. Is this correct?
[15:25:27] <some_dude> how do I turn off the title bar and 'close' icon from this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#default   ?
[15:26:49] <some_dude> nevermind found it
[15:27:17] <linelevel> Hi, how can I cause an event to fire at the time that an element matching a certain selector is added to the DOM?
[15:31:21] <nessaja> can someone tell me if this is reading the autocomplete or not please http://jsfiddle.net/6sXrZ/7/
[15:36:02] <ge2x> Hey people! Is there a way I could temporarily change the default context of jQuery in function (i.e. so that I could use $(...) instead of $(..., context)
[15:47:03] <sunbeam> I have an input field, the default value should dissapear when i click in it, and when nothing is filled in, it should be back again.. any idea how I can do this best?
[15:50:42] <tw2113> html5 placeholder
[15:52:17] <devslash> I'm using the plugin jplayer. i define a control for the next track button like this: <li><a href='#' class='jp-next' tabindex='1'>next</a></li> if i want to create an event when you click ohm the button would it be defined like this: $('#jp-next').click(function() {";
[15:54:00] <iDope> join #node.js
[15:54:08] <Peter_lee> Can anyone recommend a site of HTML5 templates for the designed challenged developer? FYI, using Ruby on Rails with Jquery to build my site.
[15:55:49] <iDope> Peter I got a pretty nifty admin panel template from themeforest
[15:55:51] <iDope> google em
[15:55:55] <devslash> hey idope
[15:56:03] <devslash> do you know if I'm doing anything wrong
[15:56:30] <iDope> sry i just joined the channel can you repost your paste
[15:56:41] <iDope> and question
[15:56:43] <Peter_lee> Ok, would it be a good one for a sports themed site? I can check it out.
[15:56:52] <devslash> I'm using the plugin jplayer. i define a control for the next track button like this: <li><a href='#' class='jp-next' tabindex='1'>next</a></li> if i want to create an event when you click ohm the button would it be defined like this: $('#jp-next').click(function() {";
[15:57:02] <iDope> Peter_lee, I guess you will find something nice there.
[15:57:53] <Peter_lee> ok thx
[15:57:53] <iDope> devslash, yes that would be it.
[15:58:29] <iDope> if there is something wrong you should be seeing that in the JS console.
[15:59:31] <iDope> and normally if there is only one control of this type on the page I'd prefer to use ids instead of classes to have my .click() functions on
[15:59:56] <iDope> but either way your method should work
[16:01:04] <devslash> hmm
[16:01:20] <iDope> devslash, sorry you have use #jp-next
[16:01:30] <iDope> hash is used for ids not classes
[16:01:35] <devslash> echo "$('#jp-next').click(function() {\n";
[16:01:43] <devslash> isn't that correct ?
[16:02:06] <iDope> that would be correct if it was <a href='#' id='jp-next' tabindex='1'>next</a>
[16:02:11] <iDope> but you are using class
[16:02:19] <iDope> for classes you use .jp-next
[16:02:22] <devslash> so no #
[16:02:31] <iDope> and I don't reccommend using classes for unique controls
[16:02:36] <devslash> $('jp-next').click(function() {";
[16:02:44] <devslash> right  ?
[16:02:46] <iDope> . at the start of jp-next
[16:02:58] <iDope> $('.jp-next').click(...
[16:03:18] <devslash> it doesn't work
[16:03:26] <devslash> it scrolls up the page a little
[16:03:40] <devslash> no error in javascript console
[16:03:52] <iDope> using an id in html is the way to go here
[16:04:02] <iDope> classes are meant to classify elements
[16:04:30] <iDope> so you'd need to use $('a.jp-next').click()
[16:04:33] <devslash> all the other buttons for play,stop etc are defined this way and work fine
[16:04:40] <iDope> hmmm
[16:04:51] <iDope> then you might have a duplicate somewhere
[16:05:03] <devslash> no
[16:05:03] <iDope> another entity with the same class which is messing things up
[16:05:40] <devslash> its defined like this:
[16:05:43] <iDope> I'm sorry then i'd have to look at the whole thing to comment any further
[16:06:20] <devslash> <div class='jp-audio'>
[16:06:20] <devslash> <div class='jp-type-single'>
[16:06:21] <devslash> <div id='jp_interface_1' class='jp-interface'><ul class='jp-controls'>
[16:06:45] <devslash> <li><a href='#' class='jp-previous' tabindex='1'>previous</a></li>
[16:06:46] <devslash> <li><a href='#' class='jp-play' tabindex='1'>play</a></li>
[16:06:48] <iDope> paste the whole thing on jsfiddle.net
[16:07:02] <iDope> the div and the js
[16:09:04] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/rDxpV/
[16:09:10] <devslash> oh whoops forgot the js
[16:09:21] <makin> Hi people, i have a multidimensional array and i want to send it with ajax. But it's impossible. The parameter dissapear :/
[16:10:06] <iDope> and put em in the right places too :)
[16:10:38] <makin> this is the array that I wanna pass with ajax: http://pastebin.com/FzUZd0Dq
[16:10:55] <makin> I'm using JSONP
[16:10:56] <iDope> makin: I'm not an expert but I'd just put it in a json string, send via ajax and parse it on the remote end
[16:11:08] <iDope> oh oops
[16:11:12] <iDope> :P you are already doing that
[16:11:52] <makin> iDope, not exactly, this is a copy-paste from my console.log :)
[16:12:32] <iDope> i didnt check that paste
[16:13:49] <makin> SO, some suggestion? I search on google.. but i didn't found good results..
[16:14:02] <iDope> can you paste your JS ?
[16:14:13] <iDope> to pastie
[16:14:32] <Whirl3d> evenin all?
[16:14:51] <iDope> hi
[16:15:06] <libryder> still afternoon here :)
[16:15:19] <iDope> nubs like me shouldn't really be helping people here, and its 2:15 AM here :P
[16:16:09] <Whirl3d> where are you guys located?
[16:16:42] <libryder> makin: they are all called Array[0]?
[16:16:54] <iDope> I'm in Saudi Arabia
[16:17:19] <libryder> makin: will you paste the output for the request headers in web developer or firebug?
[16:17:29] <makin> is a .push and console.log write always array(0)
[16:17:30] <libryder> i'm in the us pacific northwest
[16:19:19] <libryder> http://i50.tinypic.com/mv5mb8.png
[16:19:29] <makin> libryder this my code: http://pastebin.com/HQqY9z1e
[16:19:57] <libryder> makin: can you post all the code?
[16:22:01] <syborg> makin: if you need key/value pairs, use an object
[16:22:24] <syborg> arry['foo'] doesn't work with arrays
[16:22:25] <makin> syborg, but how i can send a object through ajax?
[16:22:38] <syborg> $.params
[16:22:41] <syborg> I think..
[16:22:58] <syborg> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[16:23:04] <makin> if i send a object i see [object object] on my headers
[16:23:59] <makin> syborg,  I will try.
[16:24:35] <makin> libryder, i can't send all code, but this the most important fragment: http://pastebin.com/gUXPM0Pp
[16:26:49] <devslash> dope did you look at it
[16:27:07] <makin> libryder this is my headers after sending: https://skitch.com/makinsys/ejxss/social.die.com-play.html-status-continueandplayid-500dd019570d997c11000001
[16:28:19] <libryder> makin: it doesn't look like it's failing
[16:29:13] <makin> well, there isn't the parameter in headers.. the array parameter is not sended
[16:32:49] <libryder> ah. opponent answers needs to be an object
[16:33:07] <libryder> obj.index = index; obj.time = time
[16:33:15] <makin> aha, but i can't make push in an object...
[16:33:59] <makin> i want to do .push with opponent answers
[16:34:22] <syborg> makin: maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/PgaN2/
[16:35:46] <makin> thanks syborg, now I have one solution: JSON.stringify
[16:36:01] <makin> but i don't like.. cuz i have to make some changes in the API
[16:36:08] <makin> BTW... best solution for today
[16:36:27] <libryder> woot
[16:37:15] <makin> thanks libryder and syborg
[16:37:30] <devslash> I'm defining a button like this:  <li><a href='#' class='jp-next' tabindex='1'>next</a></li> i want to create an event when you click on it. wouldn't the right way to do : $('.jp-next').click(function() { alert("yes"_; }); ?
[16:38:11] <Whirl3d> jquery doesn't particularly like hyphenated class selectors
[16:38:27] <devslash> my other buttons like play, stop etc work fine
[16:38:37] <Whirl3d> not that that is your problem, just a point of interest
[16:38:53] <devslash> what am i doing wrong ?
[16:39:00] <Whirl3d> you need to preventdefault with anchor elements
[16:39:05] <syborg> devslash: not sure if this is your problem but what you pasted is incorrect js
[16:39:10] <syborg> alert("yes"_;
[16:39:16] <devslash> i mistyped
[16:39:18] <some_dude> how do I use jquery UI themes with jsfiddle?
[16:39:21] <devslash> its correct in my code
[16:39:34] <syborg> okay just double checking
[16:39:36] <Whirl3d> some_dude, on the right you can add resources
[16:39:41] <Whirl3d> left, sorry
[16:39:48] <some_dude> Whirl3d: yea, but it doesn't do anything
[16:39:51] <devslash> Whirl3d: how do i prevent default with anchor elements
[16:40:01] <Whirl3d> did you enter the url to your theme and click the plus
[16:40:02] <libryder> some_dude: return false works
[16:40:30] <Whirl3d> devslash, $("a").click(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); doStuf();});
[16:40:41] <libryder> { alert("yes"); return false; }
[16:40:59] <libryder> reventDefault is probably better to use, but i can't get in the habit
[16:41:06] <some_dude> Whirl3d: I don't know wjhat you mean. can you make a fidldle and post link plz?
[16:41:39] <devslash> that didn't work
[16:41:42] <Whirl3d> some_dude, you are gonna have to lookup the help on jsfiddle. I mean, it's really basic stuff that you don't even need to know how to use a computer to figure out. come on
[16:42:02] <Whirl3d> you enter the url to your theme and click PLUS....that's it
[16:42:36] <kkoala2> some_dude: make sure you have a full url to the theme's css. test if it's correct first, then just add
[16:43:03] <some_dude> kkoala2: where do I find hosted jquery themes?
[16:43:18] <libryder> http://jsfiddle.net/PgaN2/
[16:43:48] <kkoala2> check themeroller, but best to use your own copy in production
[16:43:52] <libryder> some_dude: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[16:44:52] <kkoala2> Whirl3d: About those hyphenated class names - what doesn't jQuery like about them?
[16:45:29] <some_dude> libryder: ok, so basically I just add the link to the css and jq files? do I also need to add the link to the jq base lib?
[16:45:49] <tw2113> you can link to the ui on the left of jsfiddle
[16:45:53] <tw2113> see the dropdowns?
[16:45:59] <syborg> kkoala2: I use hyphenated classes all the time, theres no issue with them
[16:46:07] <kkoala2> some_dude: "Framework" dropdown, all there
[16:46:16] <Lost123> in this fiddle how can i wrapn the bigger image in a link http://jsfiddle.net/bDK2C/
[16:46:37] <Lost123> only thumbnails are wrapped in links but bigger ones are not.
[16:46:48] <some_dude> kkoala2: choosing stuff there does nothing.
[16:47:14] <kkoala2> syborg: Me too, and e.g. UI uses them too, so I was wondering. Whirl3d mentioned it earlier.
[16:47:46] <Lost123> anyone?
[16:48:55] <kkoala2> some_dude: What exactly do you want to do?
[16:49:34] <some_dude> kkoala2: I want jq ui to work in jsfiddle
[16:50:03] <some_dude> kkoala2: I'd appreciate a working example. what to put where etc
[16:50:31] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/tw2113/aTMDp/
[16:50:44] <tw2113> there you go some_dude
[16:51:15] <some_dude> tw2113: are you a complete retard?
[16:51:29] <tw2113> i'll go with....maybe
[16:51:53] <kkoala2> some_dude: Panel on the left > "Choose Framework": use dropdown for latest jQuery, and hit checkbox for jQuery UI
[16:51:53] <libryder> Lost123: the slideshow script is rewriting the contents of those divs with img tags
[16:52:05] <some_dude> ok I'll make a non working example
[16:52:08] <Whirl3d> kkoala2, it's not that you can't use hyphenated classnames, it's just that some advanced selectors mess up with hyphenated classes. I'll search the logs for an example shortly. I'm right in th emiddle of something...
[16:52:28] <Lost123> libryder: i know but it does wrap the thumbnails with links but not bigger ones, why?
[16:52:44] <Lost123> what part of script adds links in jquery code?
[16:53:05] <kkoala2> Whirl3d: thanks, don't want to interrupt you. I'll do some research :)
[16:53:34] <libryder> Lost123: you'd have to look at the code for that script
[16:53:36] <some_dude> here : http://jsfiddle.net/LMScT/
[16:53:57] <some_dude> I want that to look like this : http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#default
[16:54:03] <Lost123> libryder: i have seen but cannot find
[16:54:26] <Lost123> i spent quite some time looking at the script that is added as resource in the fiddle
[16:54:59] <Whirl3d> some_dude, before you go calling people retarded, figure it out http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LMScT/2/
[16:55:05] <Whirl3d> two steps.
[16:55:11] <Whirl3d> enter the url of a theme
[16:55:13] <Whirl3d> and press plus
[16:55:16] <Whirl3d> not hard
[16:58:13] <some_dude> Whirl3d: how in the bleeding hell am I supposed to know that?
[16:58:48] <Whirl3d> FIrst, I told you three times. Second, it's in the help. Third, it's common sense
[17:00:40] <some_dude> Whirl3d: please tell me more
[17:03:03] <kkoala2> some_dude: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/basic/introduction.html#fiddle-settings-sidebar
[17:04:56] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[17:06:21] <some_dude> kkoala2: cheers
[17:07:00] <kkoala2> some_dude: np
[17:07:22] <RangerMauve> Hello, is it possible to override the default behavioud of ALL links?
[17:07:27] <RangerMauve> *behaviour
[17:07:55] <tw2113> which behavior?
[17:08:52] <RangerMauve> Oh
[17:09:01] <RangerMauve> Well, I just want to make it perform some action when clicked
[17:09:02] <syborg> RangerMauve: $('a').on('click', function () { preventDefault(); doSomethingElse(); });
[17:09:40] <RangerMauve> syborg, would the "this" keyword be set as the current link in that case?
[17:09:49] <syborg> yes
[17:09:59] <Whirl3d> I wasn't aware that preventDefault() could be called outside of the jquery event object like that.
[17:10:03] <nessaja> can somone help me add the autocomplete to this http://jsfiddle.net/6sXrZ/7/
[17:10:16] <syborg> its untested code but *should* do the trick
[17:10:23] <nessaja> i dont know if i have to write a new function just for that but i did and its not working
[17:10:31] <RangerMauve> Sweet, I wasn't sure if that would have been the case. Thanks! Also, can't you just use return false instead of prevent default?
[17:10:51] <Whirl3d> $("a").on("click", function (e) {e.preventDefault(); doSomethingElse();}); will work, but not sure about preventDefault() by itself.
[17:11:11] <azbyin> hi all..
[17:11:20] <syborg> Whirl3d: sorry yes you are correct. good catch
[17:11:26] <RangerMauve> Thanks for the help #jquery!
[17:12:08] <azbyin> mutation events and mutation observers aren't supported/implemented even in latest releases of the browsers, right?
[17:13:02] <azbyin> How would I force a callback to be triggered when an element is hidden using $("#myel").hide() in some other part of my code?
[17:14:19] <azbyin> i have looked at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1397251/event-detect-when-css-property-changed-using-jquery?      and    http://forum.jquery.com/topic/firing-an-event-on-addclass
[17:14:52] <azbyin> the second link supposedly has code that adds 2 new events, "attrchange" and "csschange". but it doesn;t seem to work in a fiddle for noe
[17:15:30] <syborg> azbyin: you should be able to trigger any callback with trigger
[17:15:41] <syborg> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:16:07] <azbyin> thats the thing. i want this callback triggered on the "event" wherein an element is hidden
[17:16:08] <kkoala2> RangerMauve: http://jsfiddle.net/ZRdNQ/
[17:16:44] <azbyin> and there are many pathways where the element becomes hidden.
[17:16:47] <RangerMauve> Cool, thanks for the example kkoala2.
[17:17:00] <azbyin> so i simply want to detect that and do something once its gone
[17:17:41] <itool> Morning
[17:18:42] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/BcvGV/2/
[17:18:50] <shoky> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/mHFuu/1/
[17:19:13] <shoky> azbyin: i added "hide" to it..
[17:19:28] <azbyin> sweet shoky !
[17:20:01] <azbyin> lemme try to edit my fiddle to check if it works there too
[17:21:01] <shoky> sure does
[17:21:38] <azbyin> interesting that "hide" is separate from a css change
[17:22:10] <shoky> hide uses animate
[17:22:14] <azbyin> iirc, hide() is simply .css("display", "none");  with the additional functionality of saving the current value
[17:22:22] <shoky> or it just does this[i].style.display = "none";
[17:23:05] <azbyin> ah, indeed. might be because of the animate aspect that it is internally considered to be different from simply a css change
[17:24:31] <shoky> doesn't seem to be related to the animation
[17:24:34] <azbyin> shoky, i want to know how you found that adding "hide" as one of the events was going to work
[17:24:37] <shoky> doesn't really matter
[17:24:57] <azbyin> was it something you just tried or you had some idea that 'hide should work' ?
[17:25:13] <shoky> azbyin: i saw what the code does, it overrides $.fn.css and $.fn.attr
[17:25:25] <shoky> so i added hide, so that it would do the same to $.fn.hide
[17:25:29] <shoky> which is what you wanted ;p
[17:25:41] <azbyin> right, i get it now
[17:26:28] <nessaja> can someone help please?
[17:26:51] <azbyin> so essentially some extra code now gets executed when .hide() is called, assuming the "hidechange" event is bound to that element, correct?
[17:26:52] <shoky> nessaja you're not even including jquery ui
[17:28:02] <shoky> nessaja: also you didn't give the autocomplete any source..
[17:28:02] <nessaja> shoky im using jsfiddle im using version 1.7.2
[17:28:13] <shoky> nessaja: autocomplete is part of jquery UI, not jquery
[17:28:34] <nessaja> ohhh could you give me an example
[17:28:59] <shoky> umm
[17:29:29] <shoky> nessaja: http://jsfiddle.net/BLnXB/2/
[17:29:43] <shoky> nessaja: i checked jquery UI on the left, and added as resource the jquery ui css
[17:29:56] <nessaja> ok let me look at this
[17:30:04] <shoky> nessaja: and used autocomplete like it says to do in the docs: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[17:30:29] <shoky> nessaja: you were calling .autocomplete() on a div....
[17:30:41] <shoky> dont do guesswork, read the docs
[17:31:08] <nessaja> ok thank you
[17:31:12] <nessaja> i will try this out
[17:31:57] <shoky> azbyin: extra code is executed regardless of if you bind to the event, yea
[17:32:42] <azbyin> yes, and for the elements that don't bind the "hidechange" event, nothing special happens because that calllback hasn;t been defined for them, right?
[17:32:55] <shoky> azbyin: the event is still triggered though
[17:33:03] <shoky> azbyin: just nobody is handling it
[17:33:10] <azbyin> yes, thats good.
[17:33:16] <shoky> azbyin: so, the extra code is the code that triggers the event :P
[17:33:39] <azbyin> just one other thing is that in your original fiddle, clicking the hide button keep popping up the alert
[17:33:57] <shoky> yea
[17:34:02] <shoky> cause it keeps calling .hide()
[17:34:16] <shoky> which keeps triggering the event..
[17:34:30] <abletony84> Hey hey!
[17:34:33] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/FLmqg/ - how do I dim out #box (and all of its content) when the "Disable" radio is chosen?
[17:35:31] <nessaja> shoky but i cant really make a list of variables, it depends what is in the database
[17:35:55] <azbyin> shoky, i guess one could write a separate override for hide() and in it check whether the elem is currently hidden before the trigger :)
[17:35:59] <azbyin> i will try this now
[17:37:13] <shoky> abletony84 if you dim it out then you cant re-enable :P http://jsfiddle.net/FLmqg/1/
[17:37:56] <some_dude> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/FLmqg/2/
[17:39:11] <azbyin> some_dude, your radio buttons are not in a single group :)
[17:40:09] <abletony84> shoky: actually i would like to dim out #box not #switches
[17:40:16] <abletony84> some duuuude damn he left
[17:40:48] <abletony84> sorta like to signify that it's inactive
[17:41:07] <abletony84> should i use a css class with some alpha settings or does jQuery have something cool I can use?
[17:41:20] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/FLmqg/3/
[17:42:22] <abletony84> shoky: nice :D
[17:42:44] <abletony84> shoky: is there a way to still keep #box though? but just grey it out
[17:42:58] <abletony84> like uhm.. cant think of an example right now..
[17:44:27] <shoky> umm
[17:44:28] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/FLmqg/5/
[17:45:29] <abletony84> yes!!
[17:45:38] <nessaja> shoky where is says source can i leave this like [''] since its getting data from database?
[17:45:59] <abletony84> shoky: could we make the stuff in #box unclickable too?
[17:46:00] <azbyin> shoky, that is nice. but one can still select the checkboxes! abletony84, remember to disable the checkboxes too
[17:46:10] <azbyin> it really should be unclickable
[17:46:14] <shoky> nessaja: [''] is an array with one empty string. that will be the source of your autocomplete....
[17:46:15] <abletony84> azbyin: hehe indeed
[17:46:34] <shoky> azbyin: i'm only doing what he asked. proper functionality is up to him
[17:46:49] <abletony84> azbyin: mind you in the end there'll probably be radios, buttons and sliders in there too
[17:48:03] <shoky> unclickable?
[17:48:08] <shoky> you mean disable the inputs?
[17:48:13] <abletony84> yes
[17:49:13] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/FLmqg/7/
[17:50:41] <abletony84> shoky: nailed it :D
[17:50:50] <shoky> ;]
[17:50:52] * abletony84 storms shoky's apartment with lots of weed and booze
[17:50:59] <shoky> PLZ!
[17:51:17] <abletony84> before i leave, real quick could you show me how to make the animation instant instead of gradual?
[17:51:41] <shoky> instant means no animation ;P
[17:52:01] <shoky> but you can set the duration: http://jsfiddle.net/FLmqg/8/
[17:52:08] <shoky> (the 150)
[17:52:21] <azbyin> yup, just change the animate duration
[17:52:32] <shoky> 'fast' & 'slow' work too
[17:52:56] <nessaja> shoky  i dont understand, since i dont want to place any words in an array how can i make this so it searches from the database, i have the ajax and php part written already but its not using autocomplete, this is what i have http://jsfiddle.net/6sXrZ/10/
[17:53:20] <shoky> nessaja: the docs for autocomplete have examples of how to do it
[17:53:22] <nessaja> to me seems like the array needs to be empty
[17:53:32] <shoky> nessaja: you have to provide a function instead of an array
[17:53:44] <shoky> or a url
[17:53:58] <abletony84> shoky: how do i disable the animation altogether?
[17:54:05] <abletony84> tried dim_the_box.toggle({opacity: enabled ? 1 : 0.6}).find(':input').prop('disabled',!enabled); but
[17:54:17] <shoky> abletony84: .css  not .toggle
[17:54:23] <abletony84> oooh!
[17:54:26] <abletony84> gotcha
[17:54:29] <nessaja> ohhh
[17:54:49] <abletony84> beautiful.. thanks again man..
[17:54:55] <nessaja> url for the source or for the array ?
[17:55:02] <shoky> nessaja: read the docs!
[17:55:26] <shoky> nessaja: it says very clearly on the first page:  A data source can be:  an Array with local data    a String, specifying a URL    a Callback
[18:00:23] <KKendle> how is it that http://jsfiddle.net/Yh4ec/ works but the same thing won't in my editor/browser preview?
[18:01:42] <azbyin> shoky, how do i extract the display property of the elem within the overridden hide() ?
[18:02:00] <azbyin> i'm guessing the element is in the "arguments" var
[18:06:51] <shoky> azbyin: it can be more than one element..
[18:06:58] <shoky> azbyin: $('.someclass').hide()
[18:07:26] <azbyin> true..
[18:07:34] <azbyin> i guess i'll leave it as it is for now
[18:08:03] <shoky> but anyway inside the overridden hide,  'this' refers to the jq collection it was called on
[18:08:33] <shoky> so  this.css('display')  would get the display of the first element in the collection
[18:09:05] <azbyin> it is considerably better than my previous situation where i couldn;t trigger a separate callback on hide(). thanks for the help
[18:10:03] <azbyin> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/BcvGV/3/
[18:10:18] <azbyin> in console i get "TypeError: this.css is not a function"
[18:12:37] <azbyin> oh wait..
[18:12:43] <azbyin> i had it in the wrong place!
[18:14:09] <shoky> ;p
[18:14:52] <y3di> is there a way to insert an element after another element
[18:15:21] <y3di> or before
[18:15:28] <coldhead> after() or before()
[18:15:28] <shoky> y3di: .after() and .before()
[18:15:28] <b0x> append
[18:15:42] <y3di> ah makes sense
[18:15:45] <coldhead> what a lot of personal growth we're all experiencing
[18:15:47] <y3di> should probably google next time
[18:16:47] <shoky> i'm shrinking
[18:16:50] * tw2113 hands out coffee
[18:17:01] <shoky> hi brainz
[18:18:35] <azbyin> shoky, this is weird. the moment i add   console.log(this.css("display"));  as the line before oldmethod.apply(...   firefox eats 100% cpu! and finally asks me whether to stop script or let it continue!
[18:19:53] <rmurphey> coldhead: tell me more about this personal growth
[18:20:22] <coldhead> initially i thought it was some kind of tumour
[18:20:33] <rmurphey> i was afraid of that
[18:20:35] <coldhead> but my doctor said it was just a normal part of puberty
[18:20:48] <coldhead> then later my uncle said i should "embrace and rejoyce in it"
[18:21:02] <rmurphey> did he say it with a y?
[18:21:22] <coldhead> he said it with a mad glint
[18:21:44] <coldhead> then later he went to prison
[18:21:57] <shoky> azbyin: because you've also overwritten $.fn.css and $.fn.attr   so it's doing an infinite recursive call :P
[18:21:58] <coldhead> apparently he had an unhealthy interest in the boy scouts under his care
[18:22:15] <coldhead> so now i'm not sure what to think, except it's definitely not a tumour and i mustn't get sun on it
[18:22:19] <rmurphey> oh dear this story gets dark coldhead
[18:22:36] <coldhead> even the greatest men and women have their downfalls
[18:23:50] <azbyin> indeed heh
[18:23:59] <azbyin> just saw it myself
[18:24:35] <shoky> azbyin: this[0].style.display if you really want it..
[18:24:49] <LindsayMac> ghoing through and registering scripts ther ight way in wordpress in a PITA
[18:25:12] <azbyin> shoky, if i want to override only .hide()  is it:  $.fn.hide(function(){ ... }); ?
[18:25:26] <shoky> azbyin: then remove "css" and "attr" from that array..
[18:25:55] <azbyin> so i still keep the array there with only "hide" inside? seems weird to use each on an array of 1 element
[18:26:06] <shoky> why not keep it flexible?
[18:26:15] <shoky> like coldhead's tumour
[18:26:21] <azbyin> lol
[18:26:40] <shoky> azbyin: to override just hide you'd to $.fn.hide = function..  or $.fn['hide'] = function..
[18:26:48] <shoky> do*
[18:29:50] <azbyin> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/mHFuu/2/  ok, i think this part is done. i can reliably trigger my callback on hide
[18:30:23] <shoky> umm
[18:30:36] <azbyin> oh, i made some mistake?
[18:30:45] <shoky> azbyin: if this.css("display") === "none"  then that if block won't be entered,
[18:30:53] <shoky> so it won't call the old hide..
[18:31:06] <coldhead> it's not a tumour, it's personal growth
[18:31:08] <azbyin> yeah, if it is already hidden why call the old hide?
[18:31:15] <azbyin> it wouldn;t do anything
[18:31:37] <shoky> i suppose.
[18:31:40] <shoky> FINE
[18:31:52] <azbyin> :D
[18:32:00] <azbyin> thanks for the help shoky
[18:32:06] <shoky> yw
[18:33:14] <tplaner_> hey guys, how do I only highlight the actual element which is selected, not the parent element -- example http://jsfiddle.net/AKa3v/
[18:50:27] <Guest4908> hello I was wondering if it's possible to set a default time to jquery datetime picker?>
[19:02:13] <LindsayMac> prettyphoto vs fancybox .. which do you prefer for basic image and video popovers
[19:11:05] <nessaja> Could someone tell me what is the jquery function to make things dissapear after lets  say 10 sec
[19:13:13] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  you can do .hide and addClass and then add a class that has visibility:hidden
[19:13:18] <LindsayMac> any a bunch of other ways as well
[19:17:41] <LindsayMac> Anyone have a thought as to why fancybox would tell me that my content can not be loaded at this time, please try again? I'm just using the BASIC link to a larger image
[19:19:08] <LindsayMac> Sorry i dont have a demo, but the code is literally <a class="fancybox" rel="gallery" href="location/of/image.jpg"><img src="location/of/image.jpg"/> </a>
[19:19:16] <LindsayMac> and yes.. the actual image DOES exist..
[19:24:55] <nessaja> Hey LindsaMac did you sometimes it wont show the photo, did you try to use some other photo as well to test it ?
[19:33:27] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  i dont need to do that..
[19:33:29] <LindsayMac> its not the photo itself
[19:37:32] <nessaja> ohh
[19:50:02] <amirite> what's the current stable version
[19:51:01] <LindsayMac> of
[19:51:06] <azbyin> 1.7.2
[20:34:34] <wroathe> test
[20:35:12] <wroathe> When I pull content into the dom via ajax will some of the event handlers I've set up bind to those new elements or will I have to bind them after loading in the content.
[20:38:31] <LindsayMac> So i need something that will just scroll left/right when you click the left/right button.. like a slider, but I don't need it to kick directly to the next "panel"
[20:39:31] <vladikoff> LindsayMac, sorry, what do you mean "kick directly to the next panel"
[20:39:57] <LindsayMac> vladikoff:  you know how the traditional content sliders you click next and it slides right to the next panel? I do not want that
[20:40:08] <LindsayMac> instead, I am looking for something more like a scroller for thumbnails in a row
[20:41:23] <LindsayMac> catually.. kinda like something like this vladikoff : http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/#quickdemo
[20:42:42] <vladikoff> LindsayMac, ah right, well i guess the carousel plugins will help you, or you can roll your own :)
[20:43:07] <LindsayMac> vladikoff:  was looking for something lightweight.. so either a tutorial to help me roll me own (i am still new to this) or a pluign that's pretty simple
[20:45:38] <harleypig> I have a bizarre (to me anyway) problem. I have a form with a textarea.  When I click on it to enter text a dropdown menu is selected and I can't enter any text.
[20:45:45] <amirite> what is catually
[20:45:54] <harleypig> If I hold down the left mouse button I can type in the field. Weird. Any pointers?
[20:45:57] <amirite> maybe you have something over the textarea
[20:45:59] <amirite> play with zindex
[20:46:00] <LindsayMac> amirite:  its a typo
[20:46:13] <amirite> maybe your computer is broken
[20:46:22] <amirite> try killing it and throwing it out from the balcony
[20:46:28] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  you could have an element over top of it.. double check
[20:46:33] <amirite> that always helps
[20:46:36] <harleypig> amirite: heh, well, I'm new to the front end, but not development. I'm sure it's something I did.
[20:46:51] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  do you use firebug?
[20:46:57] <harleypig> LindsayMac: How do I do that? I haven't played with zindex.
[20:47:04] <harleypig> I'm using chrome's debugger
[20:47:15] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  well first have a look at the elements. Do you have a link you can share?
[20:47:25] <foucist> when i'm using #foobar on body, i and try to use $(#foobar).css('padding','');  it doesn't work?
[20:47:30] <harleypig> sure: http://finddate.harleydev.com
[20:47:53] <harleypig> err ... wait ... http://finddate.harleydev.com/new_index.html
[20:47:59] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  what do i have to do to replicate?
[20:48:31] <harleypig> Try to enter text in the textarea (below the Holidays dropdown)
[20:49:07] <compact> hi
[20:49:09] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  works fine in FF
[20:49:11] <compact> i have 		$('.jshowoff').append('<div class="description"><div id="close"><img src="images/close.png" name="close" width="66" height="16" id="close" align="right"></div><h1>Event</h1><br />Menu To be Listed here</div>');
[20:49:25] <compact> then a #close click function with $('div.description').hide();
[20:49:27] <LindsayMac> maybe it is your cpu!! lol
[20:49:28] <compact> any idea why it wont hide
[20:49:55] <harleypig> did you get my second url? the one with new_index.html?
[20:50:00] <egukin> Hello everyone. Can anyone recommend a good plugin for implementing light-weight inputs looking something like the â€œTagsâ€ input on StackOverflow? i.e. where you can let the user enter text + insert custom inline elements. I do not need auto-suggestions popups or anything, just a flexible â€œgraphicalâ€ input solution. Needs to be single-line. And ideally no jQuery IU dependency
[20:50:00] <egukin> Something like this: cl.ly/image/1t2Z1z431B3i
[20:50:10] <LindsayMac> Oh no.. i got it
[20:50:16] <LindsayMac> its a case of mistaken identity
[20:50:50] <LindsayMac> are you using something for the focus of the input?
[20:51:06] * tw2113 streaks
[20:51:09] <harleypig> Not on purpose.
[20:51:21] <egukin> @LindsayMac: sorry, what do you mean â€œfor the focusâ€?
[20:51:28] <harleypig> though, the select box has a change function that adds the holiday to the textarea ...
[20:51:39] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  if you can rebuild it on a simplified level on jsfiddle.net ?
[20:51:50] <LindsayMac> using just the code effecting those two things
[20:51:59] <harleypig> LindsayMac: I'll see what I can do.
[20:52:22] <LindsayMac>  [Break On This Error] 	
[20:52:23] <LindsayMac> if ( e.srcElement.selectedIndex > 0 ) {
[20:52:23] <LindsayMac> harleypig:  you also have an error
[20:53:10] <compact> ?
[20:53:42] <harleypig> LindsayMac: checking
[20:54:11] <harleypig> Where? Chrome's console isn't showing me anything.
[20:54:37] <LindsayMac> i just posted above
[20:54:43] <harleypig> oh ... didn't see your post
[20:55:29] <LindsayMac> ITS OK
[20:55:31] <harleypig> This is working in chrome ... sounds like there is a 'more correct' way to do this
[20:57:24] <LindsayMac> likely
[20:59:24] <compact> anybody got any idea about my problem :P
[21:00:02] <compact> ive even tried with the alert function to see if it activates and it doesnt
[21:03:34] <harleypig> LindsayMac: I can't reproduce it in jsfiddle
[21:04:29] <Whirl3d> compact, you can't have two elements with the same id
[21:05:12] <tw2113> isn't duplicate ID punishable by arrest?
[21:05:21] <BoarderX> death by snoo snoo
[21:05:23] <Whirl3d> and for future reference, in a case like yours, it's best to go to fsfiddle.net or jsbin and paste your code, sharing the link back here.
[21:06:38] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/DhQKj/
[21:08:19] <compact> what two elements are the same?
[21:11:03] <amirite> is there a w3c/html5/aria correct way to make an element focusable, e.g. a <span> or an <a>
[21:11:36] <Whirl3d> compact, are ytou trying to be funny?
[21:11:59] <compact> i wish
[21:12:20] <Whirl3d> you didn't even post the html
[21:13:05] <compact> ok, ill reupload. sorry, didnt think the html was important
[21:13:15] <Whirl3d> that's where the error is
[21:13:37] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/DhQKj/1/
[21:15:02] <BoarderX> looking at that fiddle do you really think it's helping :\
[21:19:46] <compact> :\
[21:21:10] <Whirl3d> compact, the first post that you made clearly had two elements with id='close'
[21:21:35] <Whirl3d> you have since fixed that error. But now you have two functions undefined: swapover and swapout
[21:22:06] <Whirl3d> If those are part of jshowoff, then you need to look at the jshowoff api. If you wrote those functions, I don't see them.
[21:22:33] <compact> didnt write jshowoff
[21:22:47] <compact> ok, ill have to look into it
[21:22:49] <compact> ty
[21:22:54] <Whirl3d> which is probably why they are undefined. Plus if you include the full url to your images in the fiddle, it'll make it a little easier to troubleshoot amidst 500 unfound image logs
[21:22:58] <harleypig> LindsayMac: FYI, I had a label tag in front of the holidays section that I forgot to close.  Once I closed that, everything works fine.
[21:23:06] <LindsayMac> Ahhhhhhhh see!
[21:23:08] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/DhQKj/4/
[21:24:55] <compact> ok, its local atm so sucks
[21:25:30] <tw2113> the joys of javascript, you don't need to worry about php, you can pastebin the rendered markup/code
[21:30:22] <LindsayMac> Waaahhhh fancybox with link to google maps doesnt wanna work for me... WAAAHHHH
[21:34:58] <tw2113> *snark*
[21:35:50] <Whirl3d> LindsayMac, you have to render the map with display:"block", opacity:0 before you fancybox the shit
[21:36:27] <LindsayMac> I am just calling it with a link to the map, I figured i could do that, i found a couple tutorials on the topic
[21:36:45] <LindsayMac> just a simple <a href="googlemapsurl">directions</a>
[21:37:15] <Whirl3d> ?
[21:38:00] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  lemme find the page i as reading
[21:38:17] <LindsayMac> http://webdesignandsuch.com/using-fancybox-for-responsive-google-maps/
[21:39:48] <Whirl3d> notice you tell fancybox the id of the map box
[21:39:58] <LindsayMac> yep.. got that
[21:39:59] <Whirl3d> that's cause the map is already rendered in the map box
[21:40:09] <LindsayMac> oh wait..
[21:40:44] <Whirl3d> you were providing the url of the google maps. not the id of the pre-rendered source
[21:40:55] <LindsayMac> Ahhh dont mind the idiot here
[21:41:17] <LindsayMac> wait.. no .
[21:41:19] <LindsayMac> i'm confused...
[21:41:26] <LindsayMac> where would i get the id of the prerendered source?
[21:41:43] <LindsayMac> Also, i tried to simply just use their link to their href="" and it didt work..
[21:41:55] <Whirl3d> The Google Map is in a div with an ID of mapBox. Iâ€™m using CSS to hide the div so you donâ€™t see it on the page under normal conditions.
[21:42:18] <Whirl3d> so the author of that site created a div with id=mapBox
[21:42:25] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  look at the page source of that tutorial.. it doesnt look like that at all
[21:42:31] <Whirl3d> then he called the google api to generate his map while it was hidden
[21:43:41] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i guess my brain is a little rattled still.. i dont see a container in his source to be hidden
[21:44:58] <Whirl3d> not to be rude, but of course you don't. That would ruin the entire effect
[21:45:17] <LindsayMac> I mean in the source code Whirl3d
[21:45:23] <Whirl3d> however if you look under content in a hidden block you will see it clear as day
[21:45:28] <LindsayMac> he doesnt exactly give a great outline of how he did it... which is fine, but I didnt see it
[21:45:43] <Whirl3d> just look at the source and you will see it.
[21:46:09] <Whirl3d> or just do a search for it in the console
[21:47:12] <LindsayMac> I swear to god we much be looking at something different.
[21:47:38] <LindsayMac> because I see <div class="gal"> with all the stuff in there between the <!-- demo --> tags
[21:48:25] <Whirl3d> line 86 of the source code
[21:50:29] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i have to show you this.. only so you dont think im insane http://cl.ly/image/2I0t292f2H2L
[21:53:16] <Whirl3d> that's fancybox2, fyi. LOL Different (but nearly identical) demo from the same site.
[21:53:55] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  ok.. but you tell me that you see a hidden div in the tutorial that I linked you to
[21:54:50] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  in fact, if you go to the main fancybox site, the "html" it shows you is simply the link to the map and using .fancybox.iframe
[21:55:21] <Whirl3d> http://webdesignandsuch.com/integrate-fancybox-with-google-maps/
[21:56:14] <Whirl3d> That's the version (which looks nearly identical) that I was referencing. I'm not familiar with fancybox2 api, but nonetheless, the same technique could be used and would make it a lot easier.
[21:56:33] <Whirl3d> I'llcheck out fb2 and see what they've done differently in the api.
[21:56:56] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i see this.. but where is the container for #mapbox actually made?
[21:57:09] <LindsayMac> i mean, in NONE of the source files do I see the container.. how is that possible?
[21:57:38] <LindsayMac> or at least on the other one i found
[21:57:55] <Whirl3d> It's on line 86 of this source:   view-source:http://webdesignandsuch.com/posts/fancybox-google-maps/
[21:58:42] <LindsayMac> just so i dont feel nuts.. because I was looking at this demo.. where is it here? http://webdesignandsuch.com/posts/fancybox-download/google-maps-fancybox/fancybox-google-maps.html
[21:58:56] <LindsayMac> i now see it on that one
[21:59:14] <Whirl3d> See, bascially, he makes the map ahead of time and then wraps it in an invisible div, but prepares it ahead of time.
[21:59:29] <Whirl3d> then fancybox just shows the div
[21:59:48] <LindsayMac> I understand that.. I was just completely unable to see it on the demo I found..
[22:00:01] <Whirl3d> that's the most logical way to handle it. But apparently, fb2 might do it differently. So I am checking that out now.
[22:00:35] <LindsayMac> nahh no reason for me not to use the most recent one
[22:00:44] <LindsayMac> that just happened to be the tutorial i found
[22:00:45] <Whirl3d> None the less, you can do it the way I showed you and use fb2 to just display the pre-rendered one.
[22:01:21] <Whirl3d> I have a feeling that's what we are gonna see anyways. I'm uploading his demo to my server now to play with it and see the difference.
[22:02:19] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i got the new demo working on my site
[22:02:32] <LindsayMac> it was just that tutorial that was a mess for me
[22:17:57] <coldhead> IF I COULD JUST LEAVE MY BODY FOR A NIGHT
[22:19:11] <LindsayMac> i know a few drugs for that
[22:21:12] <tw2113> drat, didn't manage to turn woocommerce dropdowns into workable radio buttons
[22:21:49] <LindsayMac> :(
[22:22:05] <LindsayMac> ok time for me to go home.. will tackle my tabs issue tomorrow.. the ONLY thing stopping from launch
[22:22:19] <tw2113> yeah, it's like 1:30 for you

[23:53:01] <amirite> is there a method to get form parameters in json form
[23:53:05] <amirite> i.e. serialize is the suck
[23:53:07] <amirite> i want json
[23:58:54] <prateekp_> https://gist.github.com/3205402  ... this is the code which gives functionality to one button and when i put this code in for loop but then this code gives functionality to last button only .... and if i write code like this  https://gist.github.com/3205408 it gives functionality to 2 buttons .... how can i write in way to give functionality to more buttons without rewriting code
