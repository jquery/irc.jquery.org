[00:01:58] <donCams> how do you scrape using jQuery? does that involve actually loading the page in an iframe?
[00:02:15] <dw> you can only do that if the page is in the same origin (domain/port/protocol)
[00:02:40] <dw> othrewise you need a proxy script on the server (terrible idea) or need to do the scraping server side (generally better)
[00:03:08] <donCams> hmmm. ok. guess perl will do it
[00:03:24] <donCams> i know php but i understand that's really slow
[00:03:53] <dw> anything that wraps libxml2 is generally fast and easy to use (css selectors, really quick parsing)
[00:04:08] <dw> unless you're handling huge / millions of files, language shouldn't matter
[00:06:36] <dw> hmm, php's docs have got real sucky in 5 years
[00:08:25] <jMike> Hello there
[00:09:59] <jMike> i have a simple problem but do not know how this problem is "called" so i do not find any solution in google. Its about the mouseover-effect that seems to be fired several times if there is some content (text) within the layer that fires the event
[00:12:02] <jMike> so if there is an DIV (as example) that has some actions to do on mouseover - those actions are also called if the pointer hits some text WITHIN that DIV
[00:12:54] <jMike> seems that the status "mouse is still over" is resettet then
[00:14:44] <Koenigsegg> I have a largeish HTML table on a page that I need to capture mouse events for. I've attached .keydown() handler to the <html> element. Problem is that the key handler gets noticeably slower as the table row count increases, from instant response to some seconds delay :-[. The handler fetches "a neighbour" element(arrow keys, moving one step in some direction), which I guess shouldn't affect
[00:15:23] <Koenigsegg> performance? But what's left then? Is event bubbling/capturing slowed down?
[00:32:11] <Koenigsegg> Any reason for using f.ex $el.attr('offsetLeft') instead of $el.offsetLeft? Afaik that's pretty much universally supported?

[01:03:58] <meesebyte> How would I make this code work on a webpage? http://jsfiddle.net/ZMqwR/1/
[01:04:16] <meesebyte> The jquery specifically
[01:08:44] <IvanKuzev> well..show us the site will you. this code works on the fiddle..you have problems moving it to the site maybe
[01:08:44] <meesebyte> Gloomer any help?
[01:08:59] <meesebyte> Eh
[01:11:32] <zedr> I have some data queried with getJSON() that I would like to store somewhere. I've have been recommended not to store them in the DOM. Where is the best place to store temporary data?
[01:11:38] <meesebyte> IvanKuzev: Would you mind making it an HTML page that works?
[01:11:47] <meesebyte> I can't get
[01:11:53] <meesebyte> To work outside of jsfiddle
[01:12:03] <meesebyte> obviously because a goof on my part
[01:13:03] <rosco_y> meesebyte: I'm having the same trouble with a jsTree example.  Works fine jsFiddle, but I don't know how to translate it to my project
[01:13:20] <IvanKuzev> meesebyte: just tell me where do you put the js code? in document ready?
[01:13:48] <meesebyte> html page
[01:13:55] <meesebyte> Wit
[01:13:58] <meesebyte> Oh
[01:14:00] <meesebyte> Yeah
[01:14:16] <IvanKuzev> thats not right in this here case
[01:14:28] <IvanKuzev> use $(window).load(function(){ instead
[01:15:34] <meesebyte> nope
[01:15:37] <meesebyte> Does the same
[01:15:44] <meesebyte> it just doesn't animate D:
[01:17:01] <meesebyte> Pmed it to you IvanKuzev.... The top one should animate
[01:17:32] <meesebyte> ocrap...
[01:18:51] <meesebyte> FIXES IT
[01:18:56] <meesebyte> fixed*
[01:19:04] <meesebyte> :D thanks
[01:19:34] <IvanKuzev> meesebyte:what was it?
[01:19:39] <meesebyte> well
[01:19:50] <meesebyte> Window load instaead of doc I'm sure
[01:19:51] <meesebyte> But
[01:20:05] <meesebyte> Mostly my nonexistent jquery.js xD
[01:20:20] <IvanKuzev> whopsie
[01:20:25] <meesebyte> yeah....
[01:20:36] <meesebyte> Look at the page now :P
[01:20:42] <meesebyte> it's possum
[01:20:47] <meesebyte> Awesome*
[01:27:29] <Koenigsegg> Would it be considered bad coding style to use $el[0].offsetLeft instead of $el.attr('offsetLeft')?
[01:28:19] <meesebyte> Are the jquery affects that delay and overlap themselves typical for any good code or mostly coder's fault?
[01:29:02] <meesebyte> I've seen a few pages with fancy jquery effects that get all jammed up after a bit or multiple hovers
[01:32:24] <Mech0z> if I have a nested div like <div class="outer"><div><div class="test"></div></div></div> will this then work $('.outer').siblings().hasClass('test') ?
[01:32:41] <Mech0z> I cant seem to get it working in my solution (Not exactly this examlple though)
[01:37:38] <IvanKuzev> Mech0z: if you need to find child element with specific class use .children() or .find()
[01:38:54] <xec> IvanKuzev: but... they are not child elements :P
[01:39:14] <xec> ?demo @ Mech0z
[01:39:14] <bot-t> Mech0z, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:39:52] <dr0id> $('.outer .test').length
[01:40:11] <IvanKuzev> xec: grandchild then //....use .find
[01:40:36] <xec> IvanKuzev: look at the code he pasted, they are not descendants
[01:40:54] <xec> oh wait
[01:41:00] <IvanKuzev> xec: you look\
[01:41:28] <xec> hehe, i mentally put in a / in the classless div, sorry
[01:41:46] <xec> ignore me, its too early
[01:43:15] <meesebyte> Dang.
[01:43:41] <meesebyte> Getting up for work in 3 hours. Spent so much time on this jquery
[01:48:30] <IvanKuzev> xec: no problem.
[01:48:54] <Mech0z> this does not work
[01:48:54] <Mech0z> IvanKuzev: http://jsfiddle.net/Rsxhq/
[01:49:08] <Mech0z> It does not find that class
[01:49:23] <Mech0z> fiddler gets those ? all over the place, ignroe that
[01:50:07] <Mech0z> http://jsfiddle.net/Rsxhq/2/
[01:50:49] <xec> Mech0z: you start by selecting <a> elements in <h3>, but there are none in the html..?
[01:51:13] <xec> and where does the h3 end
[01:52:05] <Mech0z> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/Rsxhq/3/
[01:53:22] <IvanKuzev> dublicating ids....contact_information_accordion_tab
[01:54:01] <IvanKuzev> otherwise looks fine to me
[01:55:23] <Mech0z> IvanKuzev: I dont get the popup when I close the accordion so it dont work
[01:58:14] <xec> Mech0z: thats because the element that has the unsaved data is not a child of the accordion. http://jsfiddle.net/Rsxhq/5/
[01:58:53] <xec> I did a hackish .find("*") to select each descendant element
[01:59:24] <IvanKuzev> damn....now i didnt see that.
[01:59:49] <Mech0z> so children only looks one "step" down_
[01:59:50] <Mech0z> ?
[02:01:10] <xec> Mech0z: yes, .children() only selects children, not grandchildren etc
[02:01:22] <Mech0z> ok
[02:01:24] <IvanKuzev> http://jsfiddle.net/Rsxhq/7/
[02:01:47] <IvanKuzev> better use find to check for the  unsaved dyrectly
[02:01:52] <xec> yes, much better
[02:02:56] <poppiez> I'm using jquery 1.7.1. no matter what I do I can't get the "submit" event to fire when submitting. is this a 1.7.1 bug?
[02:03:29] <xec> poppiez: not that i'm aware of
[02:03:57] <xec> poppiez: we could take a look if you show us your code, see ?demo
[02:04:03] <xec> stupid bot
[02:04:15] <xec> poppiez: pastebin your code at jsfiddle.net ;)
[02:05:01] * IvanKuzev eats fiddles
[02:05:36] <poppiez> xec: I just isolated my problem and got it to work. there must be something else at play. thx though! :)
[02:05:40] <mattyh88> can't I do this "inputfield.val()" in the checkBiggerThan360 function? http://pastebin.com/Pbcnzz39
[02:05:40] <mattyh88> it's giving me the error that there's no val()-method
[02:08:02] <xec> mattyh88: you're missing some code? what does the checkBiggerThan360() do? what is the inputfield var?
[02:09:14] <LordThumper> Hi, is there some jQuery plugin that replaces a checkbox with images? (Image for checked, another for unchecked)
[02:09:16] <LordThumper> Thanks
[02:09:21] <xec> mattyh88: assuming it actually is an inputfield, try inputfield.value or $(inputfield).val()
[02:09:25] <mattyh88> xec: http://pastebin.com/Cy6AMhN3
[02:09:55] <xec> hehe, what a function
[02:10:20] <xec> why dont you just do if(this.value > 360)
[02:10:32] <xec> and delete the function :P
[02:11:04] <mattyh88> oh right lol
[02:11:08] <mattyh88> haha
[02:11:14] <mattyh88> tired ... :P
[02:12:15] <mattyh88> thx for pointing that out :
[02:12:17] <mattyh88> :p
[02:14:13] <LordThumper> Anyone?
[02:15:05] <Zauberfisch> LordThumper no idea, but shouldn't be to hard to do it your self
[02:15:41] <rahmen> var selection = window.getSelection(); This gives me a reference to the object. So if I execute that line and then deselect the selection variable changes too. How can I prevent this?
[02:16:56] <LordThumper> Found a nice plugin on jquery.com (simpleImageCheck), but download 404ed
[02:17:37] <smolly> I have a drop down form. When I choose<option>test1</option> I want a textbox with a message shown up beside. If I choose another <option> I want a diffrent textbox show up. How can I do this
[02:17:49] <Zauberfisch> LordThumper just make 2 images your self + hidden input, then bind click change the value of the hidden input
[02:18:22] <Zauberfisch> smolly that sounds like you should go through some of the basic tutorials
[02:18:48] <LordThumper> Yeah will do that
[02:19:00] <LordThumper> Doesn't seem to involve alot of time
[02:19:04] <smolly> Zauberfisch: sure, but what is the name of the function so I know what to google on
[02:19:15] <LordThumper> Was trying to find something ready to save some time
[02:19:28] <Zauberfisch> smolly bind .change on the select element
[02:19:50] <Zauberfisch> LordThumper it probably takes more time to search it then to do it yourself (:
[02:20:19] <LordThumper> Yeah hehe
[02:20:40] <smolly> Zauberfisch: ok man, I will try
[02:27:26] <IvanKuzev> help.. i have a need of assistance...here is a fiddle to chew on http://jsfiddle.net/EueaU/
[02:28:01] <IvanKuzev> the problem is that cells[0] is aways the same in the debugger line.. no matter what i click
[02:28:06] <xec> what is rows?
[02:28:20] <IvanKuzev> an array
[02:28:57] <xec> hmm, i'm guessing you might need a closure
[02:29:20] <IvanKuzev> any ideas how  that works?
[02:29:40] <xec> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide56
[02:30:11] <xec> see the previous slide for details
[02:30:19] <IvanKuzev> ok
[02:30:48] <IvanKuzev> looks like the same...or very similar problem
[02:32:13] <xec> the thing is, in javascript you only get a scope, or namespace, inside functions
[02:33:26] <IvanKuzev> dont work inside a for/foreach?
[02:35:20] <xec> exactly
[02:37:27] <smolly> I have come this far: When I change the <option> a text shows up with the name of the <option>, how can I change it to a diffrent text? my code: http://pastebin.com/m0mtcETY
[02:38:17] <IvanKuzev> made it working like this :http://jsfiddle.net/EueaU/1/
[02:41:05] <IvanKuzev> smolly : well you can asign a value to each option. the make a switch depending onn the value to show a text you want
[02:42:23] <smolly> IvanKuzev: I have added a value to the options now, but what should I edit in the jquery code?
[02:42:34] <IvanKuzev> and can you please use jsfiddle...its like a real time environment...wqe can make changes and show them to you too
[02:44:04] <IvanKuzev> smolly: you use $(this).val() in the channge callback function to get which option is selected...
[02:45:06] <IvanKuzev> and you better change $("div").text(str); with something more specific like $("div#the_id_of_the_div").text(str);
[02:45:08] <smolly> IvanKuzev: http://jsfiddle.net/zqsQH/
[02:46:05] <Koenigsegg> Would it be considered bad coding style to use $el[0].offsetLeft instead of $el.attr('offsetLeft')? The js profiler in Chrome says a lot of time is spent in attr(). Unless I'm reading it wrong..
[02:46:32] <IvanKuzev> http://jsfiddle.net/zqsQH/1/ make it like this next time.
[02:47:10] <IvanKuzev> Koenigsegg: whatever works for you
[02:47:37] <Koenigsegg> mkay
[02:47:44] <IvanKuzev> Koenigsegg: unless you are cutting the second here..then you need to do some tests
[02:49:12] <unCork[home]> Koenigsegg: what your seeing is prob the amount of time spent from entering the function till it returns, not explicitly spent in that function
[02:49:22] <smolly> IvanKuzev: I dosent work for me
[02:49:48] <Koenigsegg> I'll snapshot it, brb
[02:49:49] <Cork[home]> Koenigsegg: and you should be using .prop of you have a new version of jquery
[02:50:05] <Cork[home]> .attr uses setAttribute
[02:50:26] <Cork[home]> of you == if you
[02:51:11] <IvanKuzev> smolly: havent edited your jquery yet....but seriously...read a bit before asking here
[02:51:41] <smolly> IvanKuzev: I know that you havent edited, but I cant get it to work the way you said me to do
[02:52:10] <Koenigsegg> Cork: Good point. However there's .delegate() lines etc in the code, which I understand would have to be rewritten to work with newer versions. (Using 1.5 now) I'm reading with attr() btw, dimensions for a few elements. Back to snapshotting.
[02:54:43] <Trudko> guys I am using jquery validation plugin and it makes error mesage in format : id of element: message, what I need is to change id part of error message for one elemenet

[03:00:52] <AliG1000> Hi - I want to alter the class name by tacking a variable onto it.
[03:01:09] <AliG1000> I'm going from:  $(".manufacturer_select").change(function()
[03:01:13] <AliG1000> to $(".manufacturer_select"+i).change(function()
[03:01:34] <AliG1000> is tacking the   i   onto the class name valid?
[03:01:40] <IvanKuzev> yeah
[03:01:45] <IvanKuzev> so far no errors
[03:02:23] <IvanKuzev> it actually looks for string or object there...so you can do  that
[03:02:57] <AliG1000> I've tried - but it fails :(
[03:03:24] <IvanKuzev> well..not becouse of these lines you wrote here
[03:04:17] <AliG1000> I've pasted the code here:  http://jsfiddle.net/hr7fL/
[03:04:49] <AliG1000> when I just insert $(".manufacturer_select1")  and $(".manufacturer_select2")  etc., it works OK
[03:05:41] <AliG1000> but the    $(".manufacturer_select"+i)   fails spectacularly
[03:06:48] <IvanKuzev> did you try to type     var i =0 in the for
[03:07:16] <AliG1000> no I haven't.  I wanted it to start at 1

[03:09:09] <xec> IvanKuzev: i think might be another job for closures(tm)
[03:09:15] <xec> think this*
[03:09:22] <IvanKuzev> AliG1000 and you may need a closure if it sends aways the max i to the ajax
[03:09:27] <xec> :D
[03:10:20] <AliG1000> Hi IvanKuzev - I have a closure at the end of the loop script
[03:10:21] <xec> AliG1000: if you show us your html too, we might be able to find a better solution
[03:10:51] <xec> AliG1000: do a console.log(i) to see what the i var is, inside the success handler
[03:11:20] <AliG1000> xec  - the HTML and PHP is way more complicated  :)  but I'll try the console.log(i)
[03:12:02] <xec> AliG1000: well, dont show us the php, grab the essentials from the generated html (view source in browser)

[03:42:28] <href> IvanKuzev: but it's not his parent (the div.input is), and it may be in other parents than two (so .parent().parent() won't work for every case)

[03:48:50] <Derk> Hello, i found a bug on the jquery.com site, where can i report that?
[03:49:13] <href> IvanKuzev: 1.4.3. I didn't knew parents(),  I had tried parent(selector) but that wouldn't work. I'm trying with parents() now :)

[03:51:26] <IvanKuzev> really good documentation.
[03:53:18] <yan_nick> Hey guys can I use the jquery ui slider with jquery ui 1.7?
[03:53:28] <yan_nick> Or is it only available in jquery 1.8?
[03:54:02] <IvanKuzev> yan_nick : diferent products diferent versions...you are messing them up
[03:54:28] <IvanKuzev> i think
[03:54:48] <yan_nick> IvanKuzev: so the slider isn't available in jquery ui 1.7? :s
[03:55:24] <yan_nick> IvanKuzev: found this one http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Javascript/CSS/jihao-ajax/WebGreatExample/jquery-ui-1.7.1.custom/development-bundle/ui/ui.slider.js.htm
[03:57:00] <IvanKuzev> that is a development version that uses jquery 1.7.1 ...and... its like the newest thing around
[03:57:32] <IvanKuzev> dont know if its ready to be released yet...but you can get the ui with the slider from jqueryui.com
[04:06:05] <barfoo365> Hi all, can anyone see why this real simple jquery speeds up the more items I add to it? http://jsfiddle.net/4kSgF/
[04:08:33] <RLa> huh, it makes my head spin
[04:09:47] <IvanKuzev> barfoo365 you are animating based on content width size.
[04:10:14] <IvanKuzev> so-- more items=bigger container= faster animation
[04:10:24] <barfoo365> ahh i see what you mean
[04:10:38] <IvanKuzev> give it a contant speed value if you want constant speed
[04:12:40] <barfoo365> I take it thats not as simple as changing a value
[04:12:51] <IvanKuzev> infact it is
[04:13:34] <IvanKuzev> barfoo365: see where you declare scroll_amount and change it
[04:13:53] <barfoo365> yep
[04:14:42] <barfoo365> got it!
[04:14:56] <barfoo365> got rid of the real_ul_width
[04:15:47] <IvanKuzev> no need for junk code
[04:16:39] <barfoo365> tnx
[04:18:57] <barfoo365> Just spotted something else with it now though - http://jsfiddle.net/4kSgF/1/
[04:19:08] <barfoo365> The restarting of the items jumps
[04:19:45] <barfoo365> I think me removing the real_ul_width has caused that
[04:19:54] <Trudko> guys I am using jquery validation plugin and it makes error mesage in format : id of element: message, what I need is to change id part of error message for one elemenet
[04:20:56] <IvanKuzev> yeah...but it looks loke it need a but rework too...lets see
[04:22:20] <EdwardIII> hey
[04:22:29] <EdwardIII> the .stop() isn't working as i'd expected here: http://jsfiddle.net/dJY7u/
[04:22:40] <EdwardIII> if you hover over another nav element the old one closes slowly instead of halting the animation completely
[04:22:57] <Kreshnik> Hello everyone, I have a question does anyone have an similar example of an image slider like this http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2585/galeriago.png I'm not yet that good in jQuery and I thought I ask here, thanks in advanced for anykind of reply.
[04:25:07] <IvanKuzev> barfoo365: i think trouble is that forst to last doesnt do what it says
[04:36:47] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Im pretty new to jquery so be gentle. I'm using a library called Jvectormaps. Its a library that renders SVG maps and such. This map has a event called onRegionClick (when a user clicks a SVG path something can happen.) Thing is when i refresh this map i think that its creating a second version of this event. what i mean by this is that when i refresh the svg map and click a region the onRgionClick event
[04:36:49] <hazamonzo> fires twice and such. I was thinking that i could use something simple like $('map').empty before rerendering the map and this would clear the map component and its events but i don't think this is the case. How might i go about removing events or debugging this issue?
[04:37:07] <hazamonzo> Does this even make any sense? :)
[04:38:24] <xec> hazamonzo: are you doing a simple refresh or are you navigating between two different pages?
[04:39:02] <hazamonzo> xec: Well it gets a little more complex but its just a refresh of the map. The map component is actually being included in another app and that handles the refresh and such
[04:39:25] <xec> hazamonzo: a common problem when events are doubled, is that the code is included / ran twice
[04:39:51] <hazamonzo> xec: Right. Im using firebug to try and debug this but like i mentioned before. Im a little new to all this :)
[04:40:15] <xec> hazamonzo: is the site live somewhere?
[04:40:18] <hazamonzo> Im not sure if i can use some code to list events and such that are listening((?)
[04:40:26] <woozly> how to make movement, only if dragging by div in div ?
[04:40:31] <hazamonzo> xec: Not at the moment but i could make it live if that would help?
[04:40:53] <woozly> I mean. Box with header at top. I want to sortable ony by dragging it's header
[04:41:01] <xec> hazamonzo: well, that would allow us to actually see the issue and debug a bit
[04:41:08] <hazamonzo> xec: if i were to put it online would that help? Would you be willing to have a look at it?
[04:47:48] <xec> hazamonzo: but the first thing i would look for is script sources, see if the code is included multiple times
[04:47:48] <SoulRaven> is it posibile with jquery or css to remove the vertical scroll bar when the size attribute is enable for 4-5 elements?
[04:47:49] <xec> woozly: maybe you want jquery ui draggable ?
[04:47:49] <woozly> xec, yeah, I use it, but I asks: I need to move div, but only if I click and try to drag div's some element (header in div)
[04:47:49] <woozly> but I don't want to drag it, if I click on whole div
[04:47:50] <xec> woozly: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#handle
[04:47:50] <woozly> ohh.. thanks xec
[04:48:01] <hazamonzo> xec: I don't like asking to be spoon fed but im completely lost here :)
[04:48:01] <hazamonzo> xec: Give me 5 minutes and i will deploy the app and solution online and pass you a URL
[04:48:03] <WalterTamboer> Hi everyone
[04:48:04] <xec> hi WalterTamboer!
[04:48:23] <hazamonzo> xec: I sent you a PM if you have a sec mate
[04:50:20] <WalterTamboer> So i extended the ui sortable... It appears that I cannot use draggables and connect them to my extended sortable. This is because the draggable tries to find the sortable widget by its key: $.data( this, 'sortable' ); But since I used an extended version of sortable, that key is never set (instead the key of my extended widget is set). How can I solve this?
[04:51:32] <SoulRaven> is it posibile with jquery or css to remove the vertical scroll bar when the size attribute is enable for 4-5 elements?
[04:52:27] <Anticom> hi all
[04:52:38] <Anticom> i've got a problem with my highlighting script
[04:52:46] <Anticom> i want to select a dom element and build up a path
[04:52:47] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/74apR/
[04:53:31] <Anticom> if i alert each element at a time, it's right, but the path in the end is rubbish, because somewhere it inserts an "undifined" at the beginning :/
[04:53:34] <Anticom> any ideas?
[04:54:36] <WalterTamboer> So I solved that sortable bug like this:
[04:54:37] <WalterTamboer> 			// !!! The widget name is not sortable anymore which means that the
[04:54:37] <WalterTamboer> 			// !!! key never gets set. This screws up the draggable. In order to
[04:54:37] <WalterTamboer> 			// !!! fix that we register the sortable key manually:
[04:54:37] <WalterTamboer> 			this.element.data( 'sortable', this.element.data( 'myWidget' ) );
[04:54:41] <WalterTamboer> Is that correct?
[04:55:20] <Anticom> WalterTamboer jsfiddle?
[04:55:36] <WalterTamboer> Sorry
[04:55:40] <Anticom> ur welcome :P
[04:56:21] <xec> Anticom: i can't make much sense out of your question, and that is a lot of javascript code. what is happening, and what did you expect instead?
[04:57:25] <Anticom> xec: okay i am writing a crawler at the moment, and i've made up a xpath-like query language to select the elements in the DOM
[04:57:33] <Anticom> now it's all about the path1()-function
[04:58:09] <Anticom> xec: i'm getting the DOM-trace up to root
[04:58:54] <Anticom> then i want to join each dom element by it's tag name (e.g. body) followed by an index specifing the count of element of that type in that depth
[04:59:35] <JWay> $("tr[class=weekrow]").each(function(th, i) {           when iterating each row in a table how can I make a $('select[name=mydropdown]) only within the current table row?
[05:01:26] <Anticom> xec: now my problem is, that there's an "undifined" put at the beginning of my pathOutput variable or something =/
[05:06:07] <Anticom> haha got it -.-
[05:06:14] <Anticom> it's got to be var pathOutput = '';
[05:15:05] <woozly> how to make move sortable item to Trash?
[05:15:56] <xec> did you try yelling at it?
[05:29:03] <yan_nick> Hey guys where is the "create" callback in jquery ui slider 1.7 ?
[05:29:42] <woozly> xec :)
[05:31:01] <xec> woozly: sorry for silly answer, but your question hit a 9.0 on my trollable-meter ;) - maybe rephrase?
[05:32:25] <xec> yan_nick: what do you mean "where"?
[05:32:50] <yan_nick> xec: when i call it it isn't executed
[05:33:04] <yan_nick> xec: i think it won't trigger
[05:33:11] <xec> ?demo @ yan_nick
[05:33:12] <bot-t> yan_nick, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[05:33:28] <yan_nick> xec: hold on ...
[05:34:57] <yan_nick> xec: i saw this jsbin and it's working jsbin.com/exaxo4/edit#javascript,html
[05:35:05] <yan_nick> http://jsbin.com/exaxo4/edit#javascript,html xec
[05:35:32] <yan_nick> xec: here the 1.7 version http://jsbin.com/exaxo4/29/edit
[05:35:37] <yan_nick> xec: it doesn't work
[05:35:46] <yan_nick> xec: the create event isn't triggered
[05:36:17] <yan_nick> xec: change and slide work fine but create isn't called
[05:38:27] <xec> yan_nick: any reason you need to use the old version?
[05:39:13] <yan_nick> xec: some other modules are incompatble with 1.8
[05:39:18] <yan_nick> xec: and jquery 1.4
[05:39:30] <yan_nick> xec: any other solutions how i can get this fixed?
[05:39:55] <yan_nick> xec: or can i copy it from 1.8?
[05:40:00] <woozly> xec, can you help? I move object by .sortable func.. And I need to know, does user move div over trash-div/container or not. If yes => change content of draggable. Please help
[05:40:30] <Kottizen> hi - can jQuery only send .post requests to files/sites within the site's own domain?
[05:40:50] <Kottizen> i.e. can I have a page on y.example.com with a scripting fetching content from x.example.com?
[05:42:15] <xec> yan_nick: jquery ui is modular, so in theory it should be possible to just include the updated slider module - i don't know what it could break though, and if it depends on other changes
[05:42:35] <yan_nick> xec: oh, 1.8 is compatible with 1.3.2 <3
[05:45:21] <xec> woozly: no, sorry, you'll have to read the docs or create a specific usecase in jsfiddle or something, that people can play with

[06:00:00] <MrNobody> Hello, I am trying to use Slimbox2 with jQuery... jQuery is working... but I can't seem to get slimbox running.... Here is my jQuery call http://pastebin.com/A0GhNUp7  And Firebug says "jQuery.slimbox is not a function"
[06:01:37] <MrNobody> I have jQuery included and then slimbox2 included... any ideas?
[06:08:50] <Taloncor> MrNobody: Isn't slimbox using mootools?
[06:10:51] <MrNobody> Talancor: I believe it uses both... at least according to their website
[06:12:18] <Taloncor> MrNobody: Can u link me the website?
[06:13:25] <MrNobody> but I may have just found the solution... I think it didn't work, because I included another asp
[06:13:57] <yan_nick> xec: 	hmm okay so i try to do it with the 1.7.2 - can you tell me how can i build an array which can i access later with ui.value ?
[06:14:18] <MagePsycho> Howdy guys
[06:14:21] <yan_nick> var ui = []; ui.value = 5;?
[06:15:08] <MagePsycho> i have div rectagular box, what i want to do is trigger the multi-ple select field so that i can search by passiing proper form values
[06:15:12] <MagePsycho> any idea guys
[06:15:25] <LordThumper> Hi, how can I fire when a checkbox of class (testClass) in a div with id (divId)
[06:15:40] <LordThumper> Something like $("#divId .testClass")
[06:15:51] <LordThumper> But that is firing twice, not once
[06:15:59] <xec> yan_nick: i'm not entirely sure what you mean, you're creating an array and trying to use it as an object?
[06:16:13] <yan_nick> xec: ah it
[06:16:19] <yan_nick> xec: ah it's an object!
[06:16:26] <yan_nick> so var ui = {value : 123}
[06:16:26] <Biomech> anyone know a website where i can get a radius on a map from a given location? i've driven alot this month and want to know what the equivalent places in the world are from me
[06:17:02] <Taloncor> MagePsycho: I do not fully get your question, but are you looking for a combobox?
[06:18:35] <xec> ?eval var ui = {value: 123}; ui.value === 123;
[06:18:38] <bot-t> xec: true
[06:19:05] <xec> if that is what you meant, yes ;)
[06:20:49] <LordThumper> $("#divId .testClass") selector is choosing both #divId and .testClass
[06:21:19] <LordThumper> How can I select an element with class .testClass that is in a div with id #divId
[06:21:58] <xec> LordThumper: your code looks allright, are you sure you don't have two elements with that classname?
[06:22:09] <xec> LordThumper: show us your html?
[06:30:58] <SpoonKing> Hi can anyone tell me why this doesnt work, jQuery(this).addClass(n); where n = 1
[06:31:22] <SpoonKing> but jQuery(this).addClass('"' + n + '"') does, but returns "1" as a class
[06:32:23] <SpoonKing> I have a foreach loop that I want to add a number to each so the end of the foreach is n = n+1
[06:33:33] <Taloncor> SpoonKing: The Argument for addClass has to be a string
[06:35:10] <Eviltwin> SpoonKing: n=n+1 is the same as n++
[06:35:49] <SpoonKing> that would make sense Taloncor
[06:36:31] <SpoonKing> Infact, yarp that was dumb, changed it to a string then passed it to addClass works fine.
[06:36:35] <SpoonKing> Should have thought about that.
[06:37:10] <SpoonKing> thanks :)
[06:41:51] <EdwardIII> the .stop() isn't working as i'd expected here: http://jsfiddle.net/dJY7u/ - if you hover over another nav element the old one closes slowly instead of halting the animation completely
[06:45:11] <SpoonKing> What would be the best way to ensure a click event is fired once and only active after an animation has finished?
[06:45:49] <Jon47> SpoonKing you can try .trigger('click')
[06:47:09] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: It does exactly what you told it to do
[06:48:05] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: You stop the old animation (slideDown) leaving the element completly slided down and then u start to slideUp
[06:48:20] <burbas> Hi. I'm trying to write a selector for a tr-element. The tr looks like this: <tr class="one two"> and I'm trying to select it with $(
[06:48:35] <burbas> '.one');
[06:48:41] <burbas> (sorry for the premature enter)
[06:48:59] <burbas> But it seems I can't select it. Any ideas on how to solve this?
[06:49:38] <d_x> SpoonKing: http://pastebin.com/mXhxVJ0r
[06:49:44] <Taloncor> burbas: That should work
[06:50:29] <d_x> this is just a sample for your problem
[06:51:08] <burbas> Taloncor: And if my classes were named "one_dark one_light" it should also work to select it with $('.one_dark') ?
[06:52:09] <Taloncor> burbas: Yeah. The name doesn't matter as long as it is a valid css class identifier
[06:53:03] <burbas> Taloncor: Okay. Then it's something else that's borking it. Thanks for the quick response!
[06:54:00] <Taloncor> burbas: You are welcome. If you provide a pastebin or jsfiddle example i could help you out
[06:54:20] <EdwardIII> Taloncor: you see what i mean though? the animations look a little crazy when you croll across 2 elements next to each other
[06:54:50] <burbas> Taloncor: That would be awesome. Will just do a little clean-up in my code so it doesn't look like crap ;)
[06:55:19] <mrevd> how can i make this function load all images in the ajaxed content before fading it in?
[06:55:22] <mrevd> http://jsfiddle.net/8FKVs/
[06:55:48] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: What exactly do you want to accomplish?
[06:56:35] <EdwardIII> Taloncor: i think what i want to do to make it look sexier is halt the previous animation if the next one starts
[06:57:04] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: Wouldn't that leave the menu in the middle of the slide? ;-)
[06:57:33] <JD-Robbs> Quite new to JS and jQ, but I am checking if a property exists on an object with if('prop' in myObject) ... But it does not work with if('prop.subprop' in myObj) ... So, would I need to create a function for that and check for both properties?
[06:57:58] <EdwardIII> Taloncor: lots of examples use .stop before a slidedown on a dropdown nav... what are they actually using it for?
[06:58:41] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: Without stop it would finish the old anmiation before starting the new one.
[06:58:48] <frasr> Hi
[06:59:24] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: Maybe you wanna try .stop(true, false) instead of .stop(true, true). It looks way sexier in my opinion
[07:00:51] <chx> Hi. I am looking for a dropdown plugin that can present more than just a tree / list of links but also, for example, a calendar
[07:03:51] <rotozip> Hi guys.  I am using .ajax to call a ColdFusion function and once I get the data back I am parsing it and pushing it into a global array.  I would like to get away from using a global yet I need access to the data at different points in the app.  Any ideas how I can do this better?  http://jsfiddle.net/rotozip/VBtGe/
[07:06:44] <Eviltwin> rotozip: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/VBtGe/1/
[07:07:05] <astropirate> rotozip, self executing function, http://jsfiddle.net/VBtGe/2/
[07:07:50] <Eviltwin> rotozip: Definitely doesn't belong in $.fn though
[07:09:54] <rotozip> Okay thanks so much guys.
[07:10:07] <EdwardIII> Taloncor: hrm that seems to break it: http://jsfiddle.net/dJY7u/2/
[07:13:37] <Taloncor> EdwardIII: Aye. Sorry.
[07:13:46] <mrevd> How do you preload images in an $.ajax response before displaying it?
[07:32:13] <dnsdds> Is $(document) not supposed to work inside a plug-in?
[07:32:57] <Eviltwin> Its supposed to work just fine
[07:33:08] <JAAulde> TeamJS is rocking--$12k to feed the hungry raised in ~50 hours. And a cool side note--we're beating the celebs! Have you contributed? http://www.crowdrise.com/celebrity-fundraisers/special/firefoxchallengeevent
[07:33:42] <dnsdds> Hmm... well, I'm trying to do a $(document).on() and it says "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'"
[07:34:37] <Eviltwin> You sure you're not doing document.on()?
[07:34:38] <JAAulde> dnsdds: are you running the version of jQuery in which `.on()` is made available?
[07:34:45] <Eviltwin> 1.7+
[07:34:53] <JAAulde> ^^
[07:35:04] <meesebyte> So, I want to make an image (http://meesebyte.com/shadow350.png) stay stationary, covering the animated image without preventing hover from starting animation. http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/qjyW9/9/
[07:35:12] <dnsdds> JAAulde: Indeed
[07:35:12] <yan_nick> hello again, it's possible to add more parameter to the callback functions? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#event-change
[07:35:18] <dnsdds> I am
[07:35:34] <wib> How do I add .animate() to an element added to the DOM dynamically?
[07:35:46] <Cork[home]> yan_nick: add them as an object
[07:35:49] <Eviltwin> wib: The same way you always animate
[07:36:19] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: What kind of parameters?
[07:36:19] <wib> Eviltwin: shouldn't I use .live for this case?
[07:36:27] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: just an id
[07:36:39] <Eviltwin> wib: You shouldn't ever use .live but .live was always for event binding and nothing else
[07:36:55] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Is the image there now?
[07:37:11] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: change : foo  and later i've function foo(event, ui, selectId) {...}
[07:37:16] <meesebyte> for now it's class background image for <a>
[07:37:22] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: but in my foo function i cannot get the selectId :c
[07:37:23] <meesebyte> eviltwin^
[07:37:44] <meesebyte> but I just want to do whatever it takes to place over everything yet still detect hover through it
[07:37:45] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: It's not showing up here because you have it as a relative URL
[07:37:49] <Eviltwin> Can you fix that and update?
[07:38:17] <meesebyte> eviltwin relative? on jsfiddle? Ill check...
[07:38:27] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: and what do you mean with object?
[07:38:47] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Try change: function(event, ui) { foo(event, ui, selectId); }
[07:39:00] <Eviltwin> Instead of just change: foo
[07:39:01] <JD-Robbs> How annoying getJSON has no error callback for jsonp
[07:39:03] <JD-Robbs> :(
[07:39:19] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: You realize that JSONP is pretty much a hack, right?
[07:39:54] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: cool works <3
[07:39:56] <JD-Robbs> Yes I do ;) ... Would still be nice to have some callbacks. Anyway, I've got a timeout now :D
[07:39:58] <yan_nick> Eviltwin++
[07:40:42] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: If you know how it works, you'd understand why an error callback wouldn't work
[07:42:16] <meesebyte> jsfiddle sure is slow right now
[07:43:59] <meesebyte> eviltwin: here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/qjyW9/9/
[07:44:06] <meesebyte> it's exactly where I want it to go
[07:44:14] <meesebyte> but since it covers the image, animation is prevented
[07:44:23] <Eviltwin> I'm not seeing an issue
[07:44:28] <meesebyte> 0_o
[07:44:28] <Rotham_> hey.. Im trying to find a datepicker plugin that will let me customize how each day cell is rendered
[07:44:28] <Eviltwin> Or a shadow
[07:44:43] <meesebyte> evil
[07:44:44] <meesebyte> ah
[07:44:47] <meesebyte> I screwed up...
[07:44:51] <Rotham_> because I want to inject some metadata..
[07:44:53] <Rotham_> any ideas?
[07:45:18] <meesebyte> eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/qjyW9/11/
[07:45:23] <meesebyte> that has it
[07:45:28] <Eviltwin> Rotham_: Sounds like you should make your own
[07:45:43] <meesebyte> I want to make hover over the shadow image trigger animation of gpSPhone icon image I guess
[07:45:59] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: How about you just bind the hover to the overlay?
[07:45:59] <Rotham_> Eviltwin: :P yeah probably
[07:46:10] <meesebyte> yeah eviltwin
[07:46:15] <meesebyte> tell me how? ^.^
[07:46:21] <meesebyte> Im new to this, :P
[07:51:53] <meesebyte> eviltwin: how would I bind hover to overlay class with current code but keep img animation as before?
[07:53:18] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: http://jsfiddle.net/qjyW9/14/
[07:53:46] <meesebyte> eviltwin: oh, sweet. Thanks a ton!
[07:54:01] <meesebyte> much simpler than I would have thought
[07:57:48] <D[4]ni> so i found the insertAfter() and insertBefore() methods, but how do i insert an element INSIDE a tag?
[07:58:05] <IvanKuzev> ?append
[07:58:06] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[07:58:06] <D[4]ni> e.g. i have an empty <select></select> and i want to fill it with <option>s
[07:58:08] <Eviltwin> D[4]ni: Depends on where INSIDE the tag you want it?
[07:58:25] <Eviltwin> Then probably append
[07:58:55] <D[4]ni> ok thanks
[07:59:53] <EdwardIII> Taloncor: any other pointers? i think true,false sounds like the kind of behaviour i'm going for
[07:59:58] <EdwardIII> except it's not behaving as expected
[08:01:10] <D[4]ni> so would it work this way?
[08:01:15] <D[4]ni> $('#add-grp-admin').append('<option></option>').attr('value', 'something').text('something');
[08:01:40] <IvanKuzev> not like that
[08:02:16] <D[4]ni> oh right, that's crap
[08:02:16] <dnsdds> After append()ing something, how do I select that element?
[08:02:22] <D[4]ni> $('#add-grp-admin').append($('<option></option>').attr('value', 'something').text('something'));
[08:02:25] <D[4]ni> this?
[08:02:51] <IvanKuzev> still wrong... the attr and text shoud be inside
[08:02:57] <IvanKuzev> with the option
[08:02:58] <Eviltwin> They are inside
[08:03:01] <Eviltwin> For the last one
[08:03:22] <IvanKuzev> oh...sorry
[08:03:27] <Eviltwin> That last one works
[08:03:34] <Eviltwin> But you can also pack it up a bit more if you want
[08:03:37] <D[4]ni> isn't the point of jquery to not build everything as strings? :p
[08:03:52] <Eviltwin> $('#add-grp-admin').append($('<option></option>',{value:"something"}).text("something"))
[08:04:01] <bambams> Has .click(...) been deprecated in favor of .bind("click, ...) or something? :-/
[08:04:10] <bambams> My collagues have begun using .bind for *everything* ..
[08:04:16] <bambams> colleagues*
[08:04:22] <Eviltwin> Or If you don't like the parens within parens $('<option></option>',{value:"something"}).text("something").appendTo('#add-grp-admin')
[08:04:31] <Eviltwin> bambams: .click has not been deprecated
[08:04:44] <D[4]ni> bambams: i think they want to seem smart
[08:04:45] <Eviltwin> But .click(...) has always been an alias for .bind('click',...)
[08:04:51] <bambams> D[4]ni: I agree. :-/
[08:05:00] <Eviltwin> There's technically an extra function call for .click
[08:05:06] <Eviltwin> Wasteful if you're doing it a lot
[08:05:20] <bambams> Eviltwin: But you probably shouldn't ever be doing it enough to matter. xD
[08:05:37] <Eviltwin> In jQuery 1.7+, use .on instead of .bind
[08:05:49] <Eviltwin> It's less to type and faster performance wise
[08:05:54] <Eviltwin> No reason not to use it
[08:08:12] <D[4]ni> and how to get the Nth <td> in a <tr>? .children()[N] ?
[08:08:59] <Eviltwin> So that you can do jQuery stuff to it?
[08:09:31] <D[4]ni> i just need to get the value
[08:09:52] <D[4]ni> something like .children()[N].text()
[08:10:08] <D[4]ni> would that work?
[08:10:12] <Eviltwin> No
[08:10:15] <Eviltwin> Do you know N ahead of time
[08:10:17] <Eviltwin> Or is it a variable?
[08:10:33] <D[4]ni> i know it
[08:10:43] <Eviltwin> Actually you probably want .children('td').eq(N).text() either way
[08:10:50] <Eviltwin> Note that .text() is a jQuery thing
[08:11:06] <Eviltwin> You can't do document.body.text() for example
[08:11:12] <Eviltwin> But you can do $(document.body).text();
[08:11:17] <D[4]ni> yeah, sure
[08:11:55] <D[4]ni> didn't know children()[N] wouldn't give me a jquery object
[08:12:17] <Eviltwin> Every jQuery collection is effectively an array of the DOM elements themselves
[08:12:26] <Eviltwin> So when you use []'s you are getting DOM elements, not jQuery objects
[08:17:59] <larsemil> hi! can i have some help please? i have a function that handles function( jQuery('.class:not(.active) ) just fine
[08:18:02] <larsemil> but when i do: function( jQuery('.active') i get: Object [object Object] has no method 'getElementsByTagName'
[08:18:54] <Eviltwin> larsemil: Can you reproduce this issue in a jsFiddle?
[08:18:59] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[08:18:59] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:19:15] <dnsdds> After append()ing something, how do I select that element?
[08:19:39] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: Why select it? You already had a reference to it, didn't you?
[08:19:39] <IvanKuzev> dnsdds: set its value to the select element
[08:21:04] <bambams> Eviltwin: Not if he appended HTML.
[08:21:52] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: http://jsfiddle.net/eVacW/
[08:22:12] <Eviltwin> bambams: Still doesn't mean there's a good way to select what he appended
[08:22:37] <Eviltwin> bambams: It's faster to create the collection of new elements, keep a reference, and then add them
[08:22:45] <Eviltwin> Rather than select afterwards
[08:22:55] <bambams> Eviltwin: I agree.
[08:24:50] <larsemil> Eviltwin: solved it, was my misstake. as usual. :D
[08:25:27] <Eviltwin> larsemil: Figured :P
[08:26:22] <larsemil> Eviltwin: difficult to select .active when row above stated $('.active').removeClass('active');
[08:27:12] <IvanKuzev> ....well try to save it to a var before removing its class
[08:27:27] <IvanKuzev> then you will have elements that had active a sec ago
[08:27:39] <dnsdds> Eviltwin: Thanks!
[08:27:40] <Eviltwin> var actives = $('.active').removeClass('active');
[08:27:43] <Eviltwin> Then work on actives
[08:27:51] <Eviltwin> actives.addClass('inactive'); etc.
[08:27:54] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: No problem
[08:28:22] <Deafgoose> Hey all, Im trying to select an element and exlude another with the following selector: $("li[id^='post'][id!='post_thanks']:gt(0)") however its not excluding the ones with id="post_thanks123" etc...what am I doing wrong
[08:28:46] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: != means exactly not equal to
[08:28:48] <Eviltwin> Err
[08:28:52] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: != means exactly not equal to
[08:29:04] <Eviltwin> post_thanks123 is not equal to post_thanks'
[08:29:20] <Eviltwin> So it passes the != test and becomes part of the collection
[08:29:29] <Eviltwin> What you probably want is the :not() pseudo selector
[08:29:45] <Eviltwin> So something like this: $("li[id^='post']:not([id^='post_thanks']):gt(0)")
[08:30:36] <Deafgoose> alright let me give that a try
[08:31:04] <Eviltwin> That means it starts with post but doesn't start with post_thanks
[08:33:01] <Deafgoose> Thanks Eviltwin, works great
[08:49:38] <aidan> How can I select all "select" elements that don't have "[day]" in their "name" attribute?
[08:50:17] <Eviltwin> aidan: $("select:not(name*=\\[day\\])") I think
[08:50:21] <aidan> ah
[08:50:53] <aidan> Still selects it :/
[08:51:54] <IvanKuzev> $("select:not(name*='[day]')")  what about this one?
[08:55:09] <Eviltwin> I think you need to both quote and escape
[08:55:43] <progrock`> Man, I'm having trouble preloading images, and geting their dimensions.  For some reason, the first image isn't getting dimensions... I'm even doing 0 timeouts to hopefully avoid any race conditions
[08:56:22] <nFFF> Can you do this: jQuery(selector).append().before(); to insert code after and before an element?
[08:57:02] <Taloncor> aidan: $("select:not([name*='day'])")
[08:59:05] <Eviltwin> nFFF: .after() and .before()
[08:59:20] <Eviltwin> Taloncor: I think he has square brackets in the name
[08:59:24] <Eviltwin> But I'm not even sure that's allowed
[08:59:52] <Eviltwin> Looks like they aren't
[09:00:03] <nFFF> Eviltwin
[09:00:07] <nFFF> .append is find
[09:00:16] <nFFF> But when I add .before it's ot insertin the code
[09:00:17] <nFFF> sec
[09:00:59] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tskCm/
[09:01:37] <Eviltwin> nFFF: see ?.append see ?.after see ?.before
[09:01:38] <bot-t> nFFF, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/

[09:13:37] <rbd> is "$(function() {" the same as "$(document).ready({" ?
[09:13:46] <D[4]ni> is there a way to reset an input type="file" to not upload any file using jquery?
[09:13:53] <D[4]ni> .val("") ?
[09:15:22] <Eviltwin> rbd: $(function(){...}) is an alias for $(document).ready(function(){...});
[09:15:46] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ D[4]ni
[09:15:47] <bot-t> D[4]ni, Try It And See
[09:16:10] <D[4]ni> ah.
[09:16:37] <D[4]ni> so at the most channels, this is a paraphrase of "yes"
[09:19:34] <Eviltwin> D[4]ni: It means that I don't know the answer but it'll probably take you all of 2 minutes to try in your code
[09:24:57] <VictorCL> I forgot how to check if a property exists in an object !??
[09:25:32] <Eviltwin> .prop("propname") ?
[09:27:30] <VictorCL> and how can I check if an object exists and is not null ?
[09:27:37] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tskCm/
[09:28:15] <Kambfhase> if( obj !== null ){ doStuff() }
[09:28:38] <nFFF> Anyone know why its not working for .before()

[09:28:44] <VictorCL> [Break On This Error] if(data !== NULL && data.error){
[09:28:53] <Kambfhase> null not NULL
[09:29:21] <NoiseEee> VictorCL: if(typeof obj!='undefined') { //its defined
[09:29:32] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: You have a "." where it doesn't belong for one thing
[09:29:53] <VictorCL> cool
[09:29:57] <NoiseEee> you mean nFFF there Eviltwin
[09:30:12] <Eviltwin> nFFF: You have a "." where it doesn't belong for one thing
[09:30:38] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: I have a bad habit of hitting the first letter of the nick and tab and just going with whatever it completes

[09:33:17] <sphinxxx> can anyone recommend a simple sftp server for windows?
[09:33:39] <Eviltwin> I'd just look at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SFTP_server_software
[09:33:58] <Eviltwin> I use `sshd` 'cause of my UNIX-based OS
[09:34:22] <Eviltwin> Or maybe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers
[09:36:42] <VictorCL> http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server.
[09:36:45] <sphinxxx> eviltwin thanks
[09:36:57] <sphinxxx> will have to do a crappy windows server for now :(
[09:38:40] <astropirate> sphinxxx, it could be worse, you can have a crappy mac server
[09:38:55] <Eviltwin> Well at least Mac would have OpenSSH installed
[09:39:29] <ploo> Eviltwin, that for me?
[09:39:37] <Eviltwin> ploo: Yup
[09:40:33] <Eviltwin> ploo: http://jsfiddle.net/7eeyu/
[09:43:44] <sphinxxx> astropirate, :O
[09:44:18] <nFFF> Ok I have the following structure: <parent> <child1> <child2>
[09:44:35] <nFFF> I want to find child2, and then insert code before the aprent
[09:44:39] <nFFF> How do I do this?
[09:44:40] <Eviltwin> I think you mean <parent><child><grandchild>
[09:44:44] <nFFF> No
[09:44:57] <Eviltwin> Okay, close all of your tags
[09:45:04] <nFFF> <parent> <child1> <child2>
[09:45:07] <nFFF> they are siblings
[09:45:07] <Eviltwin> Close your tags
[09:45:21] <nFFF> Yea sorry shorthand
[09:45:29] <nFFF> But basically need to insert code before parent
[09:45:30] <Eviltwin> Shorthand that equates to what I wrote
[09:45:31] <Eviltwin> BTW
[09:45:42] <nFFF> .before() is only isnerting before child1
[09:45:59] <Eviltwin> Before inserts before the element you selected
[09:46:08] <Eviltwin> If you want to insert before a different element, select a different element
[09:46:20] <nFFF> not possible
[09:46:22] <nFFF> perhaps
[09:46:27] <nFFF> .parent().before()?
[09:46:34] <Kambfhase> TIAS
[09:46:42] <Eviltwin> That would work
[09:46:55] <nFFF> Yes works, thanks
[09:53:13] <Engin> no .serialize for objects ?
[09:54:21] <Kambfhase> JSON.stringify()
[09:54:59] <polygon-pusher> how would I select <footer role="contentinfo">

[10:00:01] <pifantastic> ?p @ jita
[10:00:02] <bot-t> jita, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[10:00:10] <pifantastic> oops
[10:00:11] <pifantastic> I mean
[10:00:16] <pifantastic> ?ask @ risky_s
[10:00:16] <bot-t> risky_s, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:00:38] <miketaylr> haha
[10:00:59] <risky_s> wtf?
[10:01:09] <risky_s> gimmie a chance I was jst typing the question lol
[10:01:17] <pifantastic> risky_s: what I mean is
[10:01:20] <pifantastic> a/s/l?
[10:01:20] <jeffsmykil> Recomended tooltip plugin?  Has to work in IE 7
[10:02:16] <risky_s> i have a webpage now I want the to be div's within that page so instead of loading seperately, they just load with Jquery animation
[10:02:19] <pifantastic> jeffsmykil: I like the Twitter Bootstrap one: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#popovers
[10:02:25] <risky_s> is it good for SEO though?
[10:02:50] <pifantastic> risky_s: it's honestly not good for anything to have content  loading with an animation
[10:03:05] <risky_s> so I should make the pages seperate?
[10:03:30] <jeffsmykil> pifantastic: this does not reuire jquery?
[10:03:53] <pifantastic> risky_s: people tend to get excited with Ajax and want to Ajax everything in, but it's bad for a few reasons: 1) it's more difficult to make bookmarkable, you have to use hashtags or pushState 2) It's bad for SEO
[10:04:28] <Syco54645_work> so i am trying to stop html5 video using jquery. my video tag has an id of foo and i am trying to use $('#foo').pause() but chrome is reportiong the object has no method pause
[10:04:31] <Syco54645_work> any ideas?
[10:04:32] <pifantastic> and unless there is a lot of value on having the page not reload, the user doesn't really get much benefit
[10:04:42] <jeffsmykil> pifantastic: hate to load another library when im already loading jquery
[10:04:48] <khmer> pifantastic: that's all out the window if you're designing an administrative interface
[10:04:55] <risky_s> oh I see thanks
[10:05:02] <pifantastic> Syco54645_work: try document.getElementById('foo').pause();
[10:05:13] <khmer> pifantastic: anything behind an adminwall shouldn't have SEO anyway, and of course you're always getting benefits from page persistence
[10:05:53] <jita> pifantastic, http://jsfiddle.net/Z9f7v/
[10:05:56] <pifantastic> khmer: *always* is a strong way to say it, but yes, if you're building a client side application, go to town. But if you're just displaying content, don't waste everyone's time loading it with Ajax
[10:06:05] <Syco54645_work> pifantastic: that worked. should have tried that first i guess....
[10:06:32] <pifantastic> Syco54645_work: $() returns a jQuery object, not a DOM element. if you want the DOM elements in a jQuery collection, use get()
[10:06:48] <pifantastic> Syco54645_work: i.e. $('#foo').get(0).pause();
[10:06:49] <Syco54645_work> pifantastic: noted. thanks!
[10:07:37] <pifantastic> jita: Are you loading jQuery UI?
[10:07:41] <ashrewdmint> Hey folks, is there a way to automatically refresh a selector object? A shorthand for this: object = $(object.selector)
[10:07:49] <pifantastic> Plane ol' jQuery does not have tabs
[10:08:28] <pifantastic> ashrewdmint: nope
[10:08:43] <ashrewdmint> pifantastic: K
[10:09:09] <pifantastic> ashrewdmint: you can add elements to a jQuery object with add()
[10:09:09] <jita> pifantastic, yes how could i make sure that its loaded ?
[10:09:17] <pifantastic> jita, uh....load it?
[10:09:29] <jita> pifantastic, i did
[10:09:31] <pifantastic> load if *after* jQuery

[10:12:00] <VictorCL> val() gets the value ,, and for the text?
[10:12:19] <pifantastic> VictorCL $('select option:selected').text();

[10:13:39] <sphinxxx> really weird, i'm using sftp to put files on my home server, and when i make a folder, its showing up in the client, but i don't see the folder on the server
[10:17:31] <jeffsmykil> tyhis bootstrap stuff looks nice
[10:19:41] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: perhaps it is creating folders that are not executable by your web server?
[10:20:38] <vdclouis> does someone know a action script irc channel ?
[10:21:24] <jita> pifantastic, now that error is gone, but there are no tabs
[10:23:21] <pifantastic> jita: are you also including the jQueryUI css?
[10:25:29] <pifantastic> jita: http://jsfiddle.net/Z9f7v/1/
[10:26:44] <pifantastic> jita: you can add external CSS to a fiddle using the Resources option on the left: http://jsfiddle.net/Z9f7v/2/
[10:26:45] <jita> pifantastic, but i dont want the design of jquery css, do i still have to include it ?
[10:27:29] <pifantastic> jita: jQuery uses a "CSS Framework" that you'll need to style against
[10:27:38] <pifantastic> if you dont want to use the jQuery styles
[10:28:31] <sphinxxx> pifantastic, i think its a windows issue thing, the user doesnt have permissions
[10:28:38] <pifantastic> jita: the most basic is here on google's cdn: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:28:45] <sphinxxx> the server is coreftp mini, so theres basically no options
[10:28:45] <pifantastic> you can use that as a starting point and tweak
[10:31:17] <oojacoboo> anyone use Ext JS?
[10:32:49] <jita> pifantastic, yes it works using that css, but can't i use my own css file? Do i have to modify it ?
[10:34:08] <pifantastic> jita: You can use your own css file, but you'll need to use the jQueryUI CSS Framework.
[10:34:34] <pifantastic> jita: and I recommend using the jQuery UI base css as a starting point. In fact, you can use just the tabs part.
[10:34:45] <pifantastic> jita: https://gist.github.com/1498314
[10:37:38] <jita> pifantastic, using only tabs part, the current selected tab is not activated
[10:38:05] <Danielpk> Any1 know how i can get the current position using caroufredsel?
[10:42:48] <pifantastic> jita: right, if you dont use the jQueryUI CSS, you'll have to do that yourself. All jQueryUI is doing is adding/removing a bunch of classes all the time.
[10:44:07] <jita> pifantastic, the templates i have got is not jquery css framework aware, so i guess i have to make lots of amends to the css files, but i am no designer. Is there any other alternative ?
[10:45:09] <pifantastic> jita: Nope, you either use the jQueryUI base CSS, a jQueryUI Theme, or you write your own CSS adhering to the jQueryUI framework
[10:45:36] <jita> pifantastic, perhaps something like this http://www.alfajango.com/blog/jquery-easytabs-plugin/ ?
[10:47:16] <pifantastic> jita: that does look simpler, but it still requires you to write CSS that adheres to its framework
[10:52:55] <oojacoboo> anyone use Ext JS?
[10:54:07] <jita> pifantastic, it just works, excellent plugin. Thanks for the help
[10:54:20] <pifantastic> np
[10:55:30] <jita> pifantastic, you were really nice to a new comer like me, much appreciated. thanks again
[10:55:53] <pifantastic> jita: no problem
[10:56:47] <FishEee> is there out of box image cropping with jquery?
[10:59:20] <XMan2012> how can i disable all previous dates of jquery UI datapicker ?
[11:06:57] <aple> Is there a filter for selectors where I can exclude one item?
[11:07:15] <aple> For instance, if I have a list of <input>s and I want to exclude <input class="foo"> can I do that?
[11:07:42] <aple> Something like so: $('input:EXCEPT .foo')
[11:09:04] <sphinxxx> are there any plugins for putting images within letters?
[11:09:08] <ajpiano> aple: see ?:not
[11:09:08] <bot-t> aple, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[11:09:17] <sphinxxx> in other words, letters that act as a mask for an image/ multiple images
[11:10:22] <BFranks> http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/#default looks great .. how do I call it? like if I had a <button onclick="myprogressbar.progressbar( value: 80 )"> to set it to 80, what's the syntax of the onclick??
[11:10:56] <aple> ajpiano: Thanks Chief
[11:11:28] <ajpiano> BFranks: $("#button").click(function() {  $("#myprogressbar").progressbar("value", 80);  });
[11:12:13] <BFranks> ajpiano: Yikes.. why does jquery set triggers like that? so unusual for me..
[11:12:24] <BFranks> But thanks for a solution
[11:12:27] <ajpiano> that isn't "setting a trigger"
[11:12:37] <ajpiano> . whatever that is
[11:13:23] <ajpiano> jQuery is designed for attaching event handlers unobtrusively using on/bind/delegate, onclick attributes are not desirable in the least
[11:13:41] <BFranks> ? It looks like it's saying to "add this function, to this button, when it's clicked, vs. the button saying 'when I am clicked do this' ?
[11:13:43] <bot-t> BFranks, .live() - Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:14:29] <ajpiano> BFranks: the best practise in terms of event handler attachment changed some time ago, inline handlers are morose and leave you with extremely tight coupling between behaviour and presentation
[11:14:58] <NoiseEee> BFranks: ... much in the same that content and style are separated (ie; you'd never use a <font> tag anymore... so you should never inline JS anymore)
[11:14:59] <BFranks> Hehe so this old man is old? ;)
[11:15:35] <ajpiano> BFranks: old dogs can still learn new Tricks();
[11:15:45] <fourcolors> hi, I'm writing a small plugin that relies on the gmap3 plugin. I was wondering, is there a way to check to make sure in my plugin the user has included the gmap3 plugin first ?
[11:16:05] <fourcolors> kind of like his if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') throw("jQuery could not be found.");  but for the gmap3 jquery plugin ?
[11:16:12] <BFranks> I use <font> all the time.. I get tons of one-off format changes where it seems maddening to go declare something in css.. but I'm not always working on small one-off stuff.. ;p
[11:16:47] <tuxx_> hey guys could anyone point me to a good jquery sticky footer please
[11:17:39] <NoiseEee> BFranks: ...
[11:18:17] <sphinxxx> fourcolors can't you test typeof gmap3
[11:18:48] <fourcolors> sphinxxx: well that has always been turning up undefined even when the plugin was loaded :/
[11:19:06] <fourcolors> sphinxxx: I tested it in the console to be sure gmap was there
[11:19:26] <fourcolors> and typeof( gmap3 ) in the console is undefined, but I can still use the plugin
[11:19:38] <fourcolors> I thought it should return objecdt
[11:19:41] <fourcolors> object *
[11:19:44] <fourcolors> or somethign
[11:20:05] <ajpiano> fourcolors: are you just making a blind assumption that it actualyl creates 'gmap3' in the global scope?
[11:20:17] <ajpiano> or are you actually sure that that is something you can check to ensure the plugin has loaded
[11:20:40] <sphinxxx> are doing gmap3, or jQuery.gmap3
[11:21:00] <fourcolors> ooh gmap3.. let me try jQuery.gmap3 that would make sense
[11:21:29] <ajpiano> guys
[11:21:33] <ajpiano> look at the code
[11:21:37] <ajpiano> and find out where it actually puts it
[11:21:40] <ajpiano> instead of guessing.
[11:21:58] <fourcolors> ajpiano: um ya your right thats the best lol thanks for stopping the insanity
[11:22:32] <fourcolors> sphinxxx: ya that was undefined too
[11:23:38] <fourcolors> thats weird though cause aren't plugins just an extension of the jQuery object?
[11:24:14] <ajpiano> nope
[11:24:16] <ajpiano> plugins live on fn
[11:24:19] <ajpiano> $.fn.foo
[11:24:35] <fourcolors> oh
[11:24:52] <fourcolors> ah... right
[11:25:18] <fourcolors> there we go
[11:25:29] <fourcolors> typeof( $.fn.gmap3 )
[11:25:49] <BFranks> Wow.. this old dog can't get anything to work.. tried it a few ways now.. no joy? http://pastebin.com/E35qcCyG
[11:26:30] <fourcolors> Your old?
[11:27:13] <fourcolors> thanks for the help ajpiano
[11:27:17] <BFranks> Yeah .. back when I was young your had to dialup.. both ways .. to use IRC.. in the SNOW!
[11:27:22] <fourcolors> and you too sphinxxx'
[11:27:25] <BFranks> -r
[11:27:34] <MeirD> Hello, I have select elements using $(".someclass"). In return a get a jQuery list of objects... how can I prepend to this list another jQuery object?
[11:27:38] <fourcolors> lol
[11:27:49] <fourcolors> BFranks: in the static
[11:28:02] <ajpiano> you can use .add() to add it to the end of another jquery object
[11:28:22] <ajpiano> and if you want it at the beginning, add the other jquery object to it instead :)
[11:28:28] <meesebyte> BFranks, lol dial-up is the only residential internet Ive ever had and I'm 18.
[11:28:46] <MeirD> ajpiano> anyway i can push it at the beginning?
[11:28:51] <ajpiano> i already answered that
[11:28:56] <Duckpaste> http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[11:28:58] <ajpiano> add the other object to it
[11:29:03] <ajpiano> Duckpaste: that's not what he wants
[11:29:20] <MeirD> yeah, I am not talking about the DOM
[11:29:32] <logicrises> BFranks, doesnt the $(#kricky) need to be in the doc ready
[11:29:32] <MeirD> oh thnx!
[11:29:34] <BFranks> fourcolors: With a party-line.. and call alert.. damned S80=60
[11:29:43] <ajpiano> MeirD: $(".someclass").add( otherjQueryObj ).doStuff()
[11:29:55] <ajpiano> MeirD: when you're using add be careful, it doesn't mutate the original reference
[11:30:04] <jeffmoss> I created a sortable that has editable content inside the items. When I edit the content and add a bunch to it the sortable doesn't get the new size. I can set the sortable container back to height:auto and it works until I try to drag-sort it then it automatically resizes back down, anybody know about this? Any suggestion how to fix it?
[11:30:23] <ajpiano> so if you do var foo = $(".foo"); and then you want to change it, you have to do foo = foo.add(".bar");  you can't just do foo.add(".bar");
[11:30:25] <BFranks> messebyte: Okay well I'm an old spoiled fart then .. ;)
[11:30:38] <meesebyte> :p
[11:30:47] <fourcolors> lol
[11:31:25] <BFranks> logicrises: I think my hurdle is that up until this.. "javascript" was called by adding a "onsomething" to the HTML elements.. Day 1 with jquery
[11:32:19] <Zerpex> Hia guys, I'm making, so this sidebar gets fixed when u scroll, after an amount of time.. It works fine.. but only problem is, when you scroll, (do it slowly) it jumps 10px down or so, before it gets fixed.. can anyone see the error? This is my code: http://pastebin.com/rXF96m1t
[11:34:14] <BFranks> Like can't I take: http://pastebin.com/E35qcCyG and make a function called "progbarchange( whichbar, whatpercent)" and then when I want to call it I can do a "progbarchange( trgprogressbar, 80 )" ?
[11:35:20] <logicrises> yep im sure you could do that
[11:35:34] <logicrises> BFranks, im sure you could do that
[11:35:53] <BFranks> Any example? .. I just need a bridge back to old man land.. and I can get back to making things?
[11:36:06] <ajpiano> BFranks: yes, you could do that, but it's a lot better to do something like cache the actual jQuery object with the dom element reference
[11:36:31] <ajpiano> also lol <b id=
[11:36:34] <MeirD> ajpiano> is there a way to reverse the order of the list?
[11:36:45] <logicrises> ajpiano, totally agree!
[11:37:10] <pkiller> hi ppl... i have an idea just i dont know how to make it reality with jquery.
[11:37:36] <pkiller> i want to put qwebirc inside a box thingy
[11:37:39] <BFranks> There are many times when I can look at someone and say "you could do that better" .. from a very very high level understanding of what they are doing/why.. but I won't stop them from getting things done just cause there's a more advanced way.. that's silly.. :(
[11:38:01] <ajpiano> BFranks: this should show you both the answer to your question and the technique i described http://pastebin.com/9PwF8gpT
[11:38:39] <sbrick> what's a good popup menu plugin?... don't need complex... only one-level, only text (linked)
[11:39:09] <BFranks> You guys are likely right.. I probably would LOVE to spend some time with some formal training to understand a 'dom element reference' .. could be core to many things down the road.  But at the moment I want to get some one-off stuff done. ;)
[11:39:42] <logicrises> BFranks, http://pastebin.com/LpjzPAG3
[11:39:43] <ajpiano> BFranks: i'm sure that if you've been around the block for so long, you know what it means in programming for there to be a "reference", yes?
[11:44:23] <mightym> hey guys i have a strange problem with query ui and query 1.7.1, when using draggable on objects. i have several divs when i drag them around other elements get marked like when you click in a page and select text f.e.. when i use jquey 1.4.2 i don't have that effect  maybe someon else encountered this?
[11:45:10] <Eviltwin> So behavior is improbed in 1.7.1?
[11:45:15] <Eviltwin> improved*
[11:46:00] <BFranks> ajpiano: I understand references.. if I am saying var foo =  12; and the alert(foo); the alert function is referencing the local variable "foo" ?
[11:46:12] <ajpiano> BFranks: right
[11:46:21] <Eviltwin> So it'll alert 12
[11:46:23] <ajpiano> BFranks: DOM Elements are like anything else, you can have a reference to them
[11:47:08] <BFranks> ajpiano: Yes .. and I've seen "DOM Elements" mentioned before.. never looked the phrase up so it means "something to do with web"
[11:47:19] <BFranks> <- that old.. ;)
[11:47:20] <ajpiano> BFranks: i totally get the "it's my first day, get things done" mindset, but some of these things WRT to jQuery, it's better to learn sooner than later :)
[11:47:20] <Eviltwin> Heh
[11:47:30] <ajpiano> BFranks: do you know what the DOM is at all?
[11:47:50] <BFranks> If I had to guess? Distributed Object Method?
[11:47:59] <BFranks> Not that I'd know what *that* means?
[11:47:59] <Eviltwin> Document
[11:48:02] <ajpiano> :|
[11:48:10] <ajpiano> Document Object Model
[11:48:25] <ajpiano> BFranks: you'll be a lot happier working with jQuery if you learn with the DOM is
[11:48:41] <ajpiano> and fwiw, my dad knows what the DOM is, and he has prob been programming longer than you ;)
[11:48:48] <snover> happiness is overrated
[11:48:50] <ajpiano> but it did take him awhile to wrap his head around it :)
[11:49:00] <BFranks> K.. It has been jargon'd a few times now and I feel like I'm driving a car without a full understanding of how the tranny works.. ;)
[11:49:39] <ajpiano> BFranks: it's more like you're driving a car and you don't know what "the road" is
[11:49:45] <BFranks> FWIW: I learned 'pascal' and 'basic' as my initial languages.. ;p
[11:51:58] <mightym> it seems there is an old feature for draggable, a method called .disableSelection(); but it seems no where documented, does someone know if there is sth similar ?
[11:52:18] <ajpiano> mightym: it's just not docced, it's part of jQuery UI
[11:53:27] <mightym> ajpiano: do you know what the counter part of it is? enableSelection() ?
[11:53:35] <ajpiano> mightym: indeed :)
[11:53:58] <mightym> ajpiano: sry, first time using query/js  thx a lot for your kind help
[11:56:15] <mightym> ajpiano: hmmm tried it, used disable on drag and .enableSelection() on dragstop  still nothing to select :)
[11:57:51] <ajpiano> hmm :/
[12:08:48] <LordThumper> Hi, when would this trigger? $(window).unload()?
[12:09:05] <LordThumper> Tried putting some console.log() in the function but nothing is coming up in the console
[12:09:17] <Eviltwin> unload triggers right before leaving the page
[12:09:25] <Eviltwin> So you probably wouldn't see it in the console
[12:09:36] <Eviltwin> As the console usually goes away right then
[12:10:10] <LordThumper> Ah I see, thanks ;)
[12:10:18] <Eviltwin> Try an alert
[12:10:26] <LordThumper> No didn't work either
[12:10:41] <LordThumper> I will try setting a cookie, dont see any other way
[12:12:33] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/9F749/1/show/
[12:12:42] <Eviltwin> It doesn't seem to fire if you're just closing the window
[12:12:44] <Eviltwin> (Thank god)
[12:12:51] <Eviltwin> Only if you're navigating away from the page
[12:13:37] <muszek> hi... I'm writing script that other "webmasters" will be able to use in a "paste one line of code" way (the line being <div id="fill_me"></div><script src="the_url"></script>).  Now... I need to check if they're already loading jQuery and load it if they're not.  Is there a recommended way of doing it?
[12:14:16] <D[4]ni> if (jQuery == undefined) load it
[12:14:21] <Eviltwin> No
[12:14:29] <Eviltwin> if(typeof jQuery === "undefined")
[12:15:00] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Strangely enough that didn't work for me
[12:15:19] <LordThumper> Neither when navigating away, closing tab, etc
[12:15:20] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: I wouldn't be surprised if some browsers disabled the functionality entirely
[12:15:24] <muszek> thanks
[12:15:29] <LordThumper> What are you using FF?
[12:15:34] <Eviltwin> Safari
[12:15:37] <LordThumper> Oh
[12:15:49] <LordThumper> Well, maybe only the alert is suppresed
[12:19:30] <LordThumper> Yeah cookie was set correctly
[12:20:07] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you would need to set the cookie that late?
[12:21:11] <LordThumper> Yeah for saving settings
[12:21:22] <LordThumper> The only alternative would be polling every couple of seconds
[12:26:43] <LordThumper> Is there some event that fires before $(document).ready()?
[12:27:10] <LordThumper> I am saving stylesheet choice to cookie on unload like i said
[12:27:34] <LordThumper> But while the stylesheet is switched, the graphics glitch abit....
[12:29:36] <sphinxxx> lordthumper, not in jquery
[12:29:45] <sphinxxx> you can just use javascript it will run immediately
[12:30:24] <LordThumper> Like I don't set any event handling?
[12:30:38] <LordThumper> Just the script?
[12:30:57] <LordThumper> Ok will try putting the script on top, and try that
[12:32:25] <sphinxxx> can you make a jsfiddle
[12:33:18] <LordThumper> Lots of code, would be kinda hard to reproduce
[12:34:54] <LordThumper> I think I will just render the stylesheet settings server side (asp.net) and avoid the glitches while switching
[12:36:13] <ianawilson> Hi all. I am needing to do some simple scraping, and I was hoping to be able to use jQuery. The selectors will be more than sufficient, but I need to be able to take arbitrary strings and then use jQuery on them.
[12:36:21] <sphinxxx> yea you should have that server side
[12:36:28] <ianawilson> damn, really?
[12:36:28] <sphinxxx> i would not switch stylesheets with js
[12:36:37] <ianawilson> o, not me, sphinxxx?
[12:36:47] <sphinxxx> no that was for lordthumper
[12:37:03] <sphinxxx> but ianawilson, theres a tool you might like for that
[12:37:06] <sphinxxx> let me see if i can find it
[12:37:11] <ianawilson> sphinxxx: thanks!
[12:37:25] <sphinxxx> http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/
[12:37:29] <ajpiano> ianawilson: https://scraperwiki.com/
[12:37:35] <sphinxxx> oh but thats php
[12:37:50] <polygon-pusher> what would be the write way to say this .animate({margin-top: '+= 50'}
[12:38:05] <ajpiano> include px
[12:38:16] <polygon-pusher> I know margin-top is not correct but since its an object do I include the -
[12:38:28] <ajpiano> polygon-pusher: just put it in quotes
[12:38:32] <ajpiano> "margin-top"
[12:38:39] <ajpiano> you can also use marginTop as well, iirc
[12:38:47] <polygon-pusher> so I can pass a string as a id of an object?
[12:39:01] <ajpiano> wha
[12:39:07] <ajpiano> yes
[12:39:16] <polygon-pusher> sorry new to js, coming over from as3
[12:39:18] <ajpiano> {"foo-bar": 1}
[12:39:27] <polygon-pusher> wow, didnt know you could do that
[12:41:18] <Eviltwin> {"\u1234": 1}
[12:41:18] <Eviltwin> {"\r\n": "CRLF"}
[12:41:19] <Eviltwin> All sorts of magical possibilities
[12:41:25] <LordThumper> I don't see how I can post the Stylesheet choice to the server. The page has two buttons, each one switching the stylesheet. If user doesn't POST and just browses through the site, I cannot save changes server side
[12:41:49] <polygon-pusher> so I have this tag <footer role="contentinfo"> that I want to animate via $('footer[role="contentinfo"]').animate({marginTop: '+= 50'}, 1000, function()  but I cant get the selector to work
[12:42:05] <polygon-pusher> ps tried adding px too
[12:42:27] <ajpiano> how do you know it's matching any elements
[12:42:40] <polygon-pusher> console.log();
[12:42:47] <ajpiano> what's the .length of the selection
[12:42:48] <polygon-pusher> well I dont know thats the point
[12:43:01] <polygon-pusher> I should probly try to log it
[12:43:05] <ajpiano> you should
[12:43:15] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: AJAX can post to the server
[12:43:16] <mightym> does someone know how to limit f.e. how often a keyup event is fired. in my case id like fire the event 5 seconds after the user stopped typing sty to a textare
[12:43:39] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Would that work with ASP.NET?
[12:43:39] <ajpiano> mightym: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[12:43:54] <Eviltwin> It makes an HTTP POST request
[12:44:03] <Eviltwin> As long as ASP.NET speaks good HTTP, then yes
[12:44:17] <LordThumper> Ah nice thanks
[12:44:21] <polygon-pusher> so can I do a $('footer[role="contentinfo"]').length() ?
[12:44:37] <polygon-pusher> or is there a length method?
[12:44:57] <polygon-pusher> oh dooh
[12:45:00] <ajpiano> ?linaf
[12:45:01] <bot-t> .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
[12:45:10] <polygon-pusher> right just figured that
[12:45:28] <Eviltwin> Ha ha, didn't know there was a bot command for that
[12:45:43] <ajpiano> :D
[12:45:44] <astropirate> ?die
[12:45:45] <bot-t> .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[12:45:48] <astropirate> ?live
[12:45:49] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[12:45:58] <astropirate> ?abort
[12:45:59] <bot-t> astropirate, #6498 (XHR abort() method not working in IE7.)  jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6498
[12:46:00] <polygon-pusher> so length is giving me 1 and loging the object shows the div. hmm
[12:46:15] <sphinxxx> lordthumper, only other option if you don't want to post to server, is use javascript, but have a large white box that covers the entire window and fades out over a second or two
[12:46:19] <sphinxxx> that way you won't see the glitch
[12:46:23] <polygon-pusher> so the selector is working, but wonder why I cant animate
[12:46:42] <sphinxxx> polygon-pusher, jsfiddle?
[12:46:42] <ajpiano> polygon-pusher: a jsfiddle helps :)
[12:46:49] <LordThumper> sphinxxx: Ah that's a great idea, thanks alot
[12:47:05] <sphinxxx> ajpiano do you play piano or something?
[12:47:07] <polygon-pusher> gonna need to google that
[12:47:32] <ajpiano> ?jsfiddle
[12:47:32] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[12:47:36] <marcuy_> php date formats take 'd' for displaying two digits month numbers but in jquery date format takes 'dd' for that so they are incompatibles, is this possible or I'm getting something wrong?? if so, is there any standard way to translate between both?
[12:51:25] <bandroidx> hi, if i am loading some javascript via ajax using extjs, and then i want to use jquery to register an onclick on some anchor tags so i can post some ajax instead of a regular submission.
[12:51:45] <bandroidx> i am able to get my script to load via ajax but i am not able to get jquery to do anything
[12:51:48] <polygon-pusher> http://jsfiddle.net/hjRJh/
[12:51:57] <polygon-pusher> theres the jsfidle
[12:52:07] <polygon-pusher> nice site thanks for sharing that
[12:53:33] <polygon-pusher> so in short trying to animate the margin-top value on a hover of the child
[12:53:42] <bandroidx> i have tried to use jquery's .ready() function to no avail
[12:54:11] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I got disconnected
[12:54:14] <astropirate> bandroidx, because you are weak
[12:54:17] <Eviltwin> What's going on?
[12:55:20] <astropirate> there was a chicken loose in the room
[12:55:59] <polygon-pusher> ? how did it taste?
[12:56:01] <bot-t> polygon-pusher, .keypress() - Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[12:56:50] <polygon-pusher> what?
[12:57:07] <bandroidx> astropirate: that doesnt even give me a place to start looking
[12:57:35] <sbrick> what is your preferred popup menu plugin?... no complex requirements: only one-level, only text/links
[12:57:36] <polygon-pusher> what does your console say bandroids?
[12:57:42] <Eviltwin> bandroidx: Why don't you explain what's going on?
[12:57:55] <bandroidx> Eviltwin: i did
[12:57:59] <bandroidx> hi, if i am loading some javascript via ajax using extjs, and then i want to use jquery to register an onclick on some anchor tags so i can post some ajax instead of a regular submission.
[12:58:01] <bandroidx> i am able to get my script to load via ajax but i am not able to get jquery to do anything
[12:58:26] <savid> When jquery loads dom via $('#some_div').load(...),   if there are .js script tags in the dom that is loaded, does that js get executed?
[12:58:28] <bandroidx> as in if i put <script>alert('test')</script> in my ajax it does in fact execute
[12:58:45] <Eviltwin> savid: I think it says on the page. see ?load
[12:58:45] <bot-t> savid, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:58:51] <sbrick> jquery can only be linked once per page, correct?
[12:58:55] <sbrick> or has that been resolved?
[12:58:59] <bandroidx> but if i put $(document).load or $(document).ready in there it doesnt do anything
[12:59:08] <Eviltwin> sbrick: Well there's no readon to link it more than once
[12:59:11] <Eviltwin> Plan B
[12:59:13] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ bandroidx
[12:59:13] <bot-t> bandroidx, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:59:31] <sbrick> Eviltwin: I thought it had problems if it were linked more than once
[12:59:50] <sbrick> (that was based on info from a long while ago... it may have been resolved)
[12:59:57] <Eviltwin> sbrick: Don't link it more than once
[12:59:59] <sbrick> (or it might've simply been bad info)
[13:00:16] <Eviltwin> It has always been and will always continue to be a bad idea
[13:00:26] <sbrick> Eviltwin: i'm not planning to INTENTIONALLY... just curious if there are preferred techniques to avoid accidental double linking
[13:00:45] <sbrick> (mvc razor webapp)
[13:01:13] <gnarf> bandroidx: so like - are you sure $ is what you expect? are you sure that extjs has "injected" the DOM you're trying to operate on before the script is executed?  doc ready shouldn't be needed if the script tag appears AFTER the content, also in the AJAX context, the document will ALWAYS be ready
[13:01:37] <Eviltwin> sbrick: Whatever the last one loaded is will own jQuery and $
[13:01:56] <bandroidx> gnarf: yes to the first 2 but i think the problem is the #3
[13:02:45] <gnarf> bradoaks: try doing debugger; and follwing a breakpoint in chrome, make sure you are in the environment you expect to be in
[13:02:55] <gnarf> test out selectors, length, etc
[13:03:20] <gnarf> doc ready callbacks should fire immediately if the document was already ready
[13:03:35] <Eviltwin> Yup
[13:04:02] <Eviltwin> Your problem may actually be somewhere else entirely
[13:04:15] <Eviltwin> Which is why we try to get people to isolate and make a working demo of their problems at jsFiddle
[13:04:33] <imsky> i'm back
[13:04:35] <imsky> i'm crack
[13:04:41] <imsky> sorry for making you wait
[13:04:54] <bandroidx> Eviltwin: its just that its so many variables involved, code igniter, extjs, jquery
[13:04:58] <gnarf> agreed - but he's got extjs, jquery, and ajaxed content to worry about - makes fiddling a demo kinda painful ;)
[13:05:01] <bandroidx> i dont see how i can emulate it there
[13:05:06] <bandroidx> yeah
[13:05:09] <gnarf> bandroidx: its possible
[13:05:11] <gnarf> just not easy
[13:05:15] <gnarf> you make a fiddle to request
[13:05:19] <gnarf> from your demo fiddle
[13:05:22] <Eviltwin> bandroidx: That's actually knod of the point
[13:05:38] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ bandroidx
[13:05:39] <bot-t> bandroidx, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:05:43] <Eviltwin> Isolate the problem
[13:05:48] <Eviltwin> Then we can help you fix it
[13:06:25] <gnarf> Eviltwin: well, up until I said something about the possible problem areas, he might of had trouble trying to find where to isolate... :)
[13:06:33] <bandroidx> so techically there is no reason that i shouldnt be able to call $(document).ready from the document body in a script tag while being loaded via ajax? i want to make sure i am not way off here
[13:07:06] <gnarf> bandroidx: it >should< work fine, but be aware that something is probably not what you think it is
[13:07:19] <bandroidx> well firebug says jquery is loaded but enabled is 0
[13:07:23] <bandroidx> so that seems to be an issue
[13:07:24] <bandroidx> ?
[13:07:45] <gnarf> enabled?
[13:07:49] <gnarf> wtf does that even mean? :)
[13:08:02] <gnarf> for instance, jQuery if you do $( htmlwithascript ) will execute the script, even if the rest of the tags aren't injected into the dom yet
[13:08:17] <bandroidx> well $ and jquery are red
[13:08:20] <gnarf> so you have to do .append( htmlwithascript ) and then it will execute how you think
[13:08:30] <gnarf> bandroidx: red? i don't speak firebug
[13:08:43] <bandroidx> sorry i hoped you might have experience with it :)
[13:08:45] <gnarf> its so painful to debug JS
[13:09:09] <bandroidx> yeah it says its not active, sorry
[13:09:09] <gnarf> i know how to operate it, but like i've never seen "jquery" being "red"
[13:09:40] <bandroidx> i assume its showing as red in the dom list because it says its loaded and ready but not active
[13:09:46] <gnarf> way easier to just put a debugger; into your script tag and execute some JS to probe your environment from the console
[13:10:03] <bandroidx> thats basically what i have been doing with firebug
[13:10:06] <bandroidx> but i get no errors
[13:10:43] <Eviltwin> bandroidx: http://jsfiddle.net/LKrMR/
[13:11:06] <Eviltwin> I'll give you a few minutes to digest that
[13:11:18] <bandroidx> i undestand all that code
[13:11:27] <bandroidx> i am using extjs for the ajax maybe is the problem
[13:12:09] <bandroidx> basically i am using extjs's .load() which is similiar to .ajax()
[13:12:28] <Eviltwin> That's a question for #extjs not #jquery
[13:12:29] <bandroidx> and i set scripts: true so that it will actually process <script> tags (prob by passing through eval()
[13:12:38] <Eviltwin> eval() is bad
[13:12:44] <Eviltwin> Evil in fact
[13:12:50] <bandroidx> well then i doubt that is how its doing it then
[13:13:04] <Eviltwin> Maybe ExtJS is evil
[13:13:15] <bandroidx> but either way i want to then use jquery to do some tag replacements, etc in my ajax loaded content, that is what got me here
[13:13:15] <Eviltwin> Bet you didn't even think of that
[13:13:34] <NoiseEee> bandroidx: there's rarely ever a use case for using more than one JS lib
[13:13:46] <NoiseEee> bandroidx: pick one and learn it.
[13:13:53] <Eviltwin> My only advice is to start removing chunks until something works
[13:14:33] <ch3mical> Eww
[13:14:38] <bandroidx> NoiseEee: i guess because i have experience with jquery i was hoping to use it for all its jquery stuff and extjs for its containers, etc
[13:14:42] <ch3mical> That's a terrible way to troubleshoot
[13:14:59] <Eviltwin> ch3mical: He apparently can't figure out any other way to do it
[13:15:10] <ajpiano> ch3mical: it's far superior to "having a stranger figure it out for you." :(
[13:15:17] <ajpiano> that was meant to be a :)
[13:15:33] <ch3mical> Either emoticon works, I think lol
[13:15:48] <Eviltwin> I really don't think it's reasonable to expect someone else to dig through a ton of code for you
[13:15:54] <ajpiano> i had the same realisation :D
[13:16:00] <Eviltwin> I think ?jdb is a pretty reasonable expectation
[13:16:12] <Eviltwin> ?jdb
[13:16:12] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:16:14] <ch3mical> Yeah
[13:16:17] <bandroidx> well, i will keep playing, atleast i knoww what i want to do is possible
[13:16:27] <Eviltwin> bandroidx: Yeah, I did make that example for you
[13:16:42] <bandroidx> Eviltwin: i appreciate it
[13:16:59] <Pookz> Can you put jquery in a onclick?
[13:17:19] <Eviltwin> Pookz: Yeah but it's better form to select the element and bind to it than use an onclick
[13:17:57] * gnarf hears kittens crying at the sound of "onclick"
[13:17:58] <Eviltwin> Pookz: see ?.bind
[13:17:58] <bot-t> Pookz, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[13:18:09] <Eviltwin> Pookz: Or ?.on in 1.7+
[13:20:02] <Pookz> I'll do that then, thanks
[13:20:17] <bandroidx> ok thanks for your help guys
[13:20:23] <bandroidx> ttyl
[13:20:26] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[13:23:14] <bradoaks> gnarf: g-tab
[13:23:56] <gnarf> ?
[13:24:11] <LordThumper> Does Google Loader require a key now?
[13:37:03] <mattp_> if im dynamically creating elements from an html string with $('body').append()
[13:37:38] <mattp_> why is $('body').append('<div id="bar"></div>"); console.log( $("#bar") ) returning undef?
[13:37:41] <mattp_> should it?
[13:37:59] <Eviltwin> Every call to console.log() returns undef
[13:38:05] <Eviltwin> But it generally logs something out
[13:38:12] <Eviltwin> $("...") should never return undef
[13:38:24] <mattp_> Eviltwin: i mean jquery is not returning the bar dom element
[13:38:26] <Eviltwin> Unless $ is not jQuery
[13:38:36] <Eviltwin> Well be clear
[13:38:40] <Eviltwin> What is it returning
[13:38:44] <mattp_> empty [ ]
[13:38:51] <Eviltwin> HUGE difference
[13:38:55] <LessSeen> if (console) console.log('blah');
[13:39:32] <solidus-river> what am i doing wrong here
[13:39:37] <solidus-river> $(this).id is undefined
[13:39:45] <solidus-river> should it be $(this).get(0).id?
[13:39:46] <Eviltwin> mattp_: http://jsfiddle.net/mm342/
[13:40:01] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: $(this).get(0) is the same thing as $(this)[0]
[13:40:10] <Eviltwin> Alternatively you can do $(this).attr("id")
[13:40:14] <Eviltwin> But best of all
[13:40:16] <Eviltwin> Just do this.id
[13:40:25] <Eviltwin> A lot faster
[13:40:33] <Eviltwin> And a lot fewer characters
[13:40:52] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: Nice!, so the this refers to the immediate dom object, but not in jquery form?
[13:41:05] <mattp_> Eviltwin: thanks
[13:41:20] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: When dealing with "this" in jQuery-related code, it's almost always a DOM element
[13:41:31] <Eviltwin> Is this a .on/.bind handler of some kind?
[13:42:14] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: yeah, so pretty mcuh any handler function the this will be the dom element its handled by. That makes a lot of my code a LOT faster. For some reason i was doing $(this) everywhere
[13:42:37] <Eviltwin> use $(...) when you're trying to do jQuery stuff
[13:42:39] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: but i would still need the jQuery wrapper around it if i wanted to search children or call some jQuery funciton on it, correct?
[13:42:48] <Eviltwin> See above ^^
[13:43:12] <Eviltwin> So, yes
[13:43:24] <Eviltwin> Otherwise "this" refers to the thing that was clicked etc.
[13:43:29] <Eviltwin> The actual element itself
[13:43:37] <Eviltwin> And doing $(this) creates a new jQuery object with just that element
[13:43:51] <sphinxxx> is there a way to prevent indexing on a directory level?
[13:43:55] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: nice :)
[13:44:06] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: That's really a server question
[13:44:08] <Eviltwin> I think
[13:44:42] <Eviltwin> It's kind of hard to tell
[13:44:51] <Eviltwin> That question has no context except that it was posted in #jquery
[13:45:05] <Eviltwin> Which just makes it more mystifying
[13:48:26] <sphinxxx> lol
[13:49:08] <Eviltwin> Was this apache directory indexes?
[13:49:53] <sphinxxx> yes the server is running apache
[13:50:04] <Eviltwin> The .htaccess should be able to do it via Options
[13:50:08] <Eviltwin> If you've AllowedOverride
[13:50:21] <Eviltwin> By which I mean AllowOverride'd
[13:51:07] <NoiseEee> var a = el.find('div').first();   var b = el.find('div').last();   //how to compare whether a and b are referencing the same element?
[13:51:37] <Eviltwin> Well in this particular case
[13:51:45] <Eviltwin> el.find('div').first().is(':last')
[13:52:02] <Eviltwin> More generally, if it's just one element a[0] === b[0]
[13:52:08] <NoiseEee> thanks
[13:58:42] <LordThumper> Ok going jQuery 1.5.1 -> 1.7.1, hope nothing will break
[13:59:02] <snover> it probably will, if you are just dumping it and expecting it to work
[13:59:56] <LordThumper> Will break you mean?
[14:00:11] <solidus-river> whats the equivalent syntax for
[14:00:17] <solidus-river> boolean ? true : false
[14:00:22] <solidus-river> if you only want to execute on true
[14:00:42] <solidus-river> i seem to be getting syntax errors with boolean ? true ;
[14:00:57] <gnarf> huh?
[14:01:04] <gnarf> that makes no sense
[14:01:08] <solidus-river> boolean ? true : nil;
[14:01:14] <gnarf> why?
[14:01:34] <eddiemonge> solidus-river: thats not the right use for it
[14:01:36] <solidus-river> gnarf: i'm asking what the inline if statement syntax is if you only want to do something on one branch of the statement
[14:01:38] <gnarf> ?js "something" && "somethingelse"
[14:01:39] <eddiemonge> what are you using it for?
[14:01:43] <bot-t> gnarf: "somethingelse"
[14:01:50] <gnarf> ?js 0 && "somethingelse"
[14:01:51] <bot-t> gnarf: 0
[14:02:09] <gnarf> but seriously, if you are using it to "execute"
[14:02:14] <gnarf> you're using it wrong
[14:02:16] <jcrawford> someone here that can lend a hand with figuring out why my table header is shorter than the body when the table is expanded?  If you click the table header to collapse the table the header goes to the proper size: http://jsfiddle.net/9WxD9/1/
[14:02:19] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: dock_is_expanded() ? collapse_dock() : expand_dock();
[14:02:38] <gnarf> if ( dock_is_expanded ) { collapse_dock(); }
[14:02:39] <solidus-river> dock_is_expanded returns true or false
[14:02:50] <solidus-river> gnarf: what makes that better syntax than the other?
[14:02:56] <gnarf> let your minifier garble it
[14:03:06] <LordThumper> ?js 0 || 1
[14:03:06] <gnarf> solidus-river: humans can read it without arcane knowledge
[14:03:08] <bot-t> LordThumper: 1
[14:03:26] <eddiemonge> ternary is for if..else statements. not do this if this
[14:03:30] <jcrawford> mm i love ternary operators
[14:03:35] <gnarf> but what you wanted was &&
[14:03:41] <LordThumper> Does the bot actually parse the script?
[14:03:42] <gnarf> or || if you want the "falsy" case
[14:04:14] <LordThumper> ?js true || false
[14:04:16] <bot-t> LordThumper: true
[14:04:23] <jcrawford> nice bot
[14:04:27] <LordThumper> yeah
[14:04:27] <gnarf> LordThumper: pm the bot if you wanna play with it
[14:04:28] <gnarf> :)
[14:04:32] <LordThumper> lol
[14:05:02] <gnarf> solidus-river: the result of ( a && b ) will be b if a is truthy, or a if it is falsy
[14:05:21] <gnarf> the result of ( a || b ) will be a if it is truthy, or b if a is falsy
[14:05:48] <jcrawford> so anyone that can lend a hand with the fiddle above?
[14:06:04] <jcrawford> fiddle is a great idea props to the author of that site, makes things much easier "D
[14:06:12] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: Can you explain the problem. I missed it
[14:06:30] <Eviltwin> I think I see it
[14:06:48] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: for some reason my table headers are not as wide as the table body when the table is expanded.  If you go to the fiddle and click the table header it will collapse and grow to the proper size
[14:06:53] <gnarf> solidus-river: but seriously, if you are using functions and shit, write it out with if () {}
[14:06:56] <jcrawford> just not sure why it's not the full width when expanded
[14:07:06] <gnarf> because really, its just simpler
[14:07:28] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: This is a lot of CSS
[14:07:34] <Eviltwin> Can you just put in what's essential to your problem?
[14:07:37] <gnarf> and most minifiers will automatically compresse if ( a() ) { b() } into a()&&b();
[14:07:41] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ jcrawford
[14:07:41] <bot-t> jcrawford, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[14:07:45] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: ignore the bottom part, that's jQuery UI css
[14:07:45] <Eviltwin> That also applies to CSS :P
[14:08:08] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: only pay attention to like the first 20 lines of css there :D the rest is just to make the UI show in the fiddle
[14:08:33] <Vello> guys i have function function refrehTitle(param) inside of which is  $.getJSON("XXX",{param: value, ajax: 'true' .... - how can i replace "param" with actual value of param, instead of sending string "param" as parameter
[14:08:52] <gnarf> for like providing a "sane default" || makes sense a lot of times
[14:09:05] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: take the display block and inline-block off and itll fix it
[14:09:17] <jcrawford> hmm moment
[14:09:19] <gnarf> function ( something ) { var option = something.option || "defaultValue" }
[14:10:11] <jcrawford> eddiemonge: which elements are you speaking of?
[14:10:21] <jcrawford> the display block is put there from jquery's toggle()
[14:10:37] <jcrawford> i have display: none in the css commented out so it would show the issue
[14:12:39] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: I can remove the UI css but then it won't look good and you won't see the header border so it wont show it smaller
[14:12:40] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: remove ui-helper-clearfix from the thead
[14:12:43] <jcrawford> it was put there for the styling :D
[14:12:53] <jcrawford> eddiemonge: trying
[14:13:06] <SinnerNyx> i'm somewhat new to jquery. especially to writing my own plugins. Is there documentation for creating your own jquery plugins? specifically best practices, and also how to make a function to become available on all jquery objects
[14:13:32] <eddiemonge> ?writing plugins @ SinnerNyx
[14:13:33] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:13:34] <jcrawford> eddiemonge: thanks that did it, now I will investigate why it was doing it :D
[14:13:55] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: because you were changing the display property for that element. it was applying display block
[14:14:05] <SinnerNyx> perfect, thanks eddiemonge
[14:14:08] <eddiemonge> and theads arent a block display kind of gal
[14:14:27] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: It's from the ui-helper-clearfix
[14:14:36] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[14:14:43] <Eviltwin> NVM, eddiemonge got it
[14:14:50] <gnarf> ?twss @Eviltwin
[14:14:50] <bot-t> Eviltwin, <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[14:14:51] <gnarf> oops
[14:15:00] <gnarf> that was meant to be @eddiemonge
[14:15:04] <gnarf> sorry Eviltwin :)
[14:15:08] <version2beta> Hi, I'm finding myself very confused over $.ajax context. In my test case, it does exactly what I'd expect - ``this`` is the context I set. In other cases (once it's mixed in with handlebars and Drupal and the rest of the project code other people wrote) my context is at this.context, not this. What am I missing? Help?!?
[14:15:08] <jcrawford> thanks Eviltwin :D

[14:16:35] <jcrawford> is there a way in css to remove the cell spacing?
[14:16:42] <jcrawford> I notice a small white space between my header columns
[14:17:11] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: border-collapse
[14:17:19] <jcrawford> going to read up on that thanks
[14:17:48] <Eviltwin> Heh: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html
[14:17:52] <Eviltwin> Is that footer a work in progress too?
[14:18:12] <Eviltwin> Seems to have some major alignment issues
[14:18:43] <jcrawford> seems centered to me, what's the issue?
[14:18:51] <jcrawford> i need to learn to spot these things lol
[14:18:59] <Eviltwin> The close button
[14:19:11] <Eviltwin> And the poor choice in colors
[14:19:45] <jcrawford> yeh the colors scream at you
[14:19:58] <jcrawford> there's a way to get a users attention and that's a bad way IMO lol
[14:22:26] <jcrawford> ok guys one more question.  When you click the table header the body goes away, however the text fades out then the borders just dissapear is there a way to make it all go at the same time: http://jsfiddle.net/9WxD9/3/
[14:22:48] <jeffsmykil> Was wpndering how you declare a class and call a function in jquery ui dialog
[14:23:40] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: see ?.animate
[14:23:41] <bot-t> jcrawford, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:23:43] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: how do i do this the right way?  http://pastie.org/private/wfvekpivbxdwp48swvctda
[14:23:46] <Eviltwin> Any numberic property can be animated
[14:23:59] <Eviltwin> What is that?
[14:24:11] <jeffsmykil> let me give you more
[14:24:30] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: http://pastie.org/private/wfvekpivbxdwp48swvctda
[14:24:35] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: I take it toggleFade() won't work with tables and I have to fade out the borders myself?
[14:24:37] <Eviltwin> Objects are of this form: http://json.org/object.gif
[14:24:54] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: I don't really use toggleFade so I can't help you
[14:25:12] <jcrawford> hmm whats the point of using private pastes if you publicly share the URL lol :D
[14:25:15] <jcrawford> thanks Eviltwin
[14:26:32] <jeffsmykil> so eviltwin the function s part of the object?
[14:26:35] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I've only ever seen the buttons mapped to functions, not objects
[14:26:39] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do?
[14:26:54] <jeffsmykil> ..close it?
[14:27:49] <Eviltwin> Okay, I think you need to do click: function
[14:27:51] <Eviltwin> Not just function
[14:28:31] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: even using animate({opacity: 0.25}) on the panelBody the text fades out then the borders just vanish
[14:28:45] <jeffsmykil> indeed that was the answer
[14:28:49] <jeffsmykil> YOURE SO SMAHT
[14:29:13] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I don't use jQuery UI so I always need to look up the syntax
[14:29:24] <jeffsmykil> i tried
[14:29:29] <jeffsmykil> it didnt make sense
[14:29:48] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: Perhaps you could fade the border-color property or something
[14:29:49] <Eviltwin> I don't know
[14:30:21] <jcrawford> yea was just trying to fade the border
[14:35:22] <D[4]ni> uhm, jquery just decided to break my slideDown()
[14:36:20] <Eviltwin> jQuery ususally makes better decisions than you
[14:36:30] <hightekvagabond> jquery isn't self aware, so I doubt it decided to do much of anything
[14:36:57] <D[4]ni> it leaves my div i want to slideDown() like this:
[14:36:59] <D[4]ni> <div id="step2" style="overflow: hidden; height: 1px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
[14:37:03] <D[4]ni> (firebug says)
[14:37:16] <hightekvagabond> I take that back, I bow to Eviltwin's supprior knowledge of jquery, it is self aware and smarter than you
[14:38:32] <D[4]ni> ...wut?
[14:38:37] <D[4]ni> works in ie, doesn't in ff
[14:38:56] <jeffsmykil> mother fucker
[14:39:02] <jeffsmykil> and immmm staying late
[14:39:11] <D[4]ni> i did not set any breakpoints or stuff in firebug O.o
[14:39:31] <eddiemonge> D[4]ni: so whats the problem?
[14:39:44] <D[4]ni> <div id="step2" style="overflow: hidden; height: 1px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
[14:39:49] <D[4]ni> that is my problem
[14:39:55] <D[4]ni> the div scrolls down for exactly one pixel
[14:40:09] <D[4]ni> but
[14:40:10] <D[4]ni> wtf
[14:40:13] <D[4]ni> this is weird
[14:40:17] <D[4]ni> i closed the tab in ff
[14:40:22] <D[4]ni> opened it again
[14:40:24] <D[4]ni> -> works
[14:40:30] <D[4]ni> crazy stuff...
[14:41:07] <eddiemonge> D[4]ni: do you also have a slideUp?
[14:41:16] <D[4]ni> yep.
[14:41:23] <D[4]ni> and just reloading the page didn't help
[14:42:02] <eddiemonge> D[4]ni: its probably because you clicked it a couple of times and its state got stuck see ? stop
[14:42:02] <bot-t> D[4]ni, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:45:26] <D[4]ni> ah, no
[14:45:35] <D[4]ni> it indeed seems to have something to do with firebug
[14:45:56] <D[4]ni> but i just want to inspect the source (as it actually is, modified by javascript)
[14:46:05] <D[4]ni> i don't set any breakpoints or anything
[14:47:05] <D[4]ni> uhm...
[14:47:47] <D[4]ni> how can i create events on items (or its classes) i create LATER in the source?
[14:48:03] <D[4]ni> ah, nvm
[14:48:31] <D[4]ni> used the "class" attribute in my create line, instead of addClass()
[14:49:23] <D[4]ni> ...still doesn't work
[14:50:19] <D[4]ni> what's the correct event to react on a checkbox state change? click() and change() don't seem to work
[14:55:26] <D[4]ni> i have some checkboxes inserted in my document like this:
[14:55:34] <D[4]ni> $('#step2_content1').append($('<input />', { type: 'checkbox', value: id }).addClass('user-select').after(data['priv'][id]).after('<br />'));
[14:56:03] <D[4]ni> but the click and change events don't seem to trigger
[14:56:10] <D[4]ni> $('.user-select').change(function() { ... }
[14:56:16] <D[4]ni> oh and
[14:56:17] <D[4]ni> );
[14:56:50] <eddiemonge> D[4]ni: where are you binding them? what version of jq are you using?
[14:57:28] <D[4]ni> $(function() { $('.user-select').change(function() { ... }); });
[14:57:31] <D[4]ni> jquery 1.7.1
[14:58:25] <D[4]ni> i'm even alert()ing something in the very beginning of that event
[14:58:29] <D[4]ni> gives me nothing
[14:59:06] <eddiemonge> D[4]ni: you need to use .on() to "delegate" it
[14:59:09] <mdel_> D[4]ni: you want $().live
[14:59:24] <eddiemonge> otherwise wheny you bind, there is nothing to bind too
[14:59:30] <eddiemonge> mdel_: .live() is deprecated
[14:59:36] <mdel_> eddiemonge: ah, good to know
[14:59:46] <mdel_> im stuck in Drupal, we only get 1.3.2  :(
[15:02:25] <D[4]ni> so, $('.user-select').on("click", function() { ... }); ?
[15:02:29] <D[4]ni> ^ this doesn't work
[15:03:01] <D[4]ni> "change" still no
[15:03:18] <greg606> hi
[15:03:18] <D[4]ni> am i still doing something wrong?
[15:03:24] <greg606> I need your help
[15:04:13] <greg606> I have a multilvel accordion and when section is empty i have instead a paragraph but this doesn't work :(
[15:04:50] <greg606> I mean p instead of h3 and no div
[15:06:13] <D[4]ni> ah, now i got it
[15:06:32] <aidan> mdel_: you can have 1.7 if you like
[15:06:41] <mdel_> aidan: not in Drupal 6
[15:06:52] <aidan> mdel_: yes in Drupal 6, http://drupal.org/sandbox/aidan/1367896
[15:06:54] <mdel_> not without using noConflict, or breaking the backend
[15:07:08] <mdel_> i know i can replace it on the frontend, but its a crap solution
[15:07:21] <mdel_> aidan: nice, I'll look at that
[15:10:05] <SinnerNyx> if my jquery plugin updates things in realtime, should I just set an interval function of my own or is there some way to plugin to some kind of onidle/update within jquery?
[15:13:21] <mdel_> aidan: what did you end up doing to get views UI to work?
[15:13:26] <mightym> is it possible that unload() just works with functions which block the browser from closing like alert? id wanted to save some contents of the page on the server on unload, but it seems there is no function executed on unload like querying a url
[15:13:27] * mdel_ knows this is OT
[15:20:28] <pringlescan> Hey everyone. I'm trying to make a JSON call and it's not returning results... however, when I watch wireshark, the data is being transferred. When I check in Firebug and Chrome the data is blank as well. Any ideas?
[15:24:25] <aidan> Is there a neat way to write this? select:not([name*='day']):not([name*='year']):not([name*='month'])
[15:25:09] <ajpiano> aidan: you can put them all inside the same :not()
[15:25:26] <ajpiano> i'd just do $("select").not(...)
[15:25:35] <coldhead> so would i
[15:25:36] <aidan> has to be a single selector
[15:25:42] <ajpiano> why
[15:26:07] <aidan> An unfortunate limitation of the app
[15:26:49] <ajpiano> ok well you can combine them into a :not([name='foo'],[name='bar'])
[15:26:55] <aidan> ah, neat
[15:26:56] <aidan> thanks
[15:30:59] <LordThumper> I am using Fancybox. The modal option creates an overlay between the Fancybox div and the elements underneath
[15:31:07] <jcrawford> guys i have a table with 2 columns, the UI Theme puts a border around the table cells in ui-widget-content. I would like to remove only the border seperating the columns, is there way to do this something like .panelBody td:first { border-right: 0; } .panelBody td:last { border-left: 0; } <-- I tried this but no worky :D
[15:31:12] <LordThumper> Is there any way to bring an element from under the overlay towards the top?
[15:31:21] <jcrawford> LordThumper: change the z-index
[15:31:23] <LordThumper> The z-index css property is having no effect
[15:31:26] <jcrawford> ah
[15:31:37] <jcrawford> sorry i am still new but was worth suggesting :D
[15:31:38] <abjorn> :o
[15:31:43] <LordThumper> Ah thanks anyways mate
[15:32:28] <LordThumper> jcrawford try td:first .panelBody
[15:32:32] <LordThumper> Switch the selectors
[15:32:49] <jcrawford> LordThumper: but the selectors do not appear in that order in my html so it would never match :D
[15:33:15] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:33:23] <ProLoser|Work> anyone have chrome want to debug my extension?
[15:33:24] <jcrawford> i have <tbody class="panelBody"><tr class="panelRow"><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
[15:34:19] <ProLoser|Work> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cahmhjehomglimoklhidcfdlfmahlold does installing this extension download a file for you?
[15:34:51] <jcrawford> got it had to be .panelBody :first-child { } and .panelBody :last-child { }
[15:35:29] <LordThumper> Ah nice :)
[15:37:04] <jcrawford> so I got that to work but now the question comes at what if I had 3 columns and only wanted to remove the inner borders, so remove right/left from all columns other than first/last
[15:37:50] <jcrawford> I know it would be simpler to only add borders to the first-child and last-child elements but I won't know the color code as that is determined by UI, so with that said is there a way in jquery or css that I could remove left/right borders from inner cells of the table?
[15:45:32] <pringlescan> has anyone had trouble with JSON and Jquery/Firebug? I can't get it to parse a valid JSON response.
[15:45:44] <danzik17> jcrawford: could probably do something like $( '.panelRow td ').not( ":first" ).css( "border-left", "").end().not( ":last" ).css( "border-right", "")
[15:46:58] <jcrawford> danzik17: thanks, looking to see if there is a pure css solution, if not that's the route I will go :D
[15:48:01] <danzik17> jcrawford: yes.  you need to use CSS specificity to replace the .not since there's no CSS equivalent i believe
[15:48:05] <danzik17> but it's doable.
[15:49:48] <jcrawford> danzik17: that jquery code also does not work, it removes the border from the first and last element too lol
[15:51:06] <danzik17> jcrawford: that was purely untested.  it'll work, just tinker with it.
[15:51:57] <danzik17> in fact if you copied and pasted it, it might have been because of an extra trailing space in the first selector.
[15:52:37] <jcrawford> danzik17: this is the css way: .panelBody td:not( :last-child ) {
[15:53:39] <jcrawford> danzik17: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#negation
[15:54:34] <danzik17> ah, guess :not is in CSS3.
[15:57:46] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have a copy of jquery tools tooltip dynamic plugin i could have?  the site seems to be broken, im on a deadline, and i want to go home
[16:09:19] <fotoflo> hi all
[16:09:53] <fotoflo> is there a better way to format this? maybe with .wrap() or something? $("#searchResults").append('<li class = "resultVid ui-state-default" id = "result' + index +'"><div><img src = "' + thumbLink + '"><div>' + entry.title.$t +'</div></div></li>');
[16:10:09] <fotoflo> right now i have it all on one line
[16:11:06] <_zoggy_> i would say put in your dummy html and then use jquery to replace the html/text
[16:11:16] <_zoggy_> reduce what your actually doing
[16:12:15] <fotoflo> _zoggy_: this is coming off an ajax query
[16:12:46] <guy> var recursive_animation	= arrow.animate({top: 10}, 1000, function(){ arrow.animate({top: 20}, 1000, recursive_animation) });
[16:12:48] <guy> how do I do that?
[16:13:37] <guy> now this triggers the following error
[16:13:37] <guy> Uncaught TypeError: Property '[object Object]' of object #<Object> is not a function
[16:15:09] <guy> well, I did it using setInterval.
[16:18:14] <jcrawford> hey guys I have a table header which has an onclick event in jquery.  I I click it sometimes I see the blue selection go over the text, etc in the header.  Is there a way to prevent the selection from happening?  I tried e.preventDefault() thinking that might do it but it did not
[16:19:32] <guy> jcrawford: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/826782/css-rule-to-disable-text-selection-highlighting
[16:19:48] <jcrawford> thanks
[16:20:19] <fotoflo> how do i check if something has children?
[16:20:32] <guy> fotoflo: api.jquery.com/contains
[16:20:58] <guy> sorry, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[16:21:06] <guy> those are a bit different.
[16:22:15] <jcrawford> thanks for all the help guys
[16:23:40] <guy> Good night
[16:23:43] <fotoflo> guy: what about children()?
[16:23:51] <guy> fotoflo: sure.
[16:23:59] <guy> Depends on what exactly you need.
[16:24:52] <fotoflo> guy: if i have a jquery element and i do !!$("#element").children()  if it doesn't have children i get an []
[16:24:57] <fotoflo> sorr
[16:25:07] <fotoflo> sorry if i do !! i get true
[16:25:27] <fotoflo> i want to be able to run an if statement on it
[16:27:39] <berndj> how about if ($("#element").children().size()) { ... } ?
[16:28:10] <berndj> (for fotoflo)
[16:28:23] <fotoflo> that could work.
[16:28:40] <guy> size()? why not simply length.
[16:29:29] <fotoflo> i actually just want to check if it has children, and if it does, remove them. So i ditched the off and just did $(el).children().remove()  and it works.  however i wonder if I'm wasting a lot of cycles much of the time
[17:09:57] <BFranks> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started says I can change a simple argument with $('#mySliderDiv').slider({ orientation: 'vertical' });  - BUT when I say var ort= 'vertical'; $('#mySliderDiv').slider({ orientation: 'ort' });   ---- It's all fail?

[17:24:26] <zatan> Hi, how I can use "this" selector with effect? please can anyone look  at this : http://jsfiddle.net/YPsNJ/
[17:25:36] <nsanden> why when i click the link, 'active' class is removed as expected, then i click the link again, and the function fires again (trying to remove the 'active' class again)
[17:25:37] <nsanden> $(".active").click(function() { $(this).removeClass("active"); }
[17:29:03] <Chibby_> nsanden: what is actually wrong? looks like it works to me
[17:29:15] <Chibby_> nevermind
[17:30:03] <nsanden> wierd eh
[17:30:27] <Chibby_> nsanden: i believe the click is bound (binded?) to the element
[17:30:40] <Chibby_> and removing the class won't remove the bind
[17:30:44] <nsanden> ahh
[17:30:51] <nsanden> is there a way to remove the bind?

[17:35:12] <zatan> Chibby_,  thank u so much ;)
[17:42:42] <fructose> Anyone know how to force a jQuery tooltip to stay on the existing page (rather than expand the page, which makes it impossible to read unless you somehow scroll without changing the cursor position)?
[17:53:09] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to jquery/js and wonder if its possible to set a val of an textfield without focus depending on which key is pressed (just keys with chars, nothing like ctrl, alt return ) ?
[18:02:15] <Bankzilla> mightym: sounds like your looking for ?keypress
[18:02:59] <fris> is this possible? $('img',this).hover(function()
[18:03:10] <Bankzilla> no
[18:03:42] <Bankzilla> ? keypress
[18:03:43] <bot-t> .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[18:04:02] <fris> trying to use a hover in a plugin applied to the selector for an image $('div.video').yt(); and i want to do $(this).hover for the img attr
[18:04:30] <aple> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out this AJAX stuff, it was working a while ago, but somewhere along the way it broke. Anyone notice any glaring errors here? http://pastie.org/3043821
[18:04:41] <aple> (just a few lines of a basic $.ajax call)
[18:04:56] <fris> http://pastebin.com/g6mDUwYa
[18:05:35] <coldhead> aple: i prefer to let jQuery wrap up my data for me, as in data: {time: time, date: date}
[18:05:45] <coldhead> but that isn't an error
[18:05:53] <coldhead> just a convenience
[18:06:01] <fission6> is there a plugin to make an ajax call when the user hits the bottom of the page? like a "load more"
[18:06:13] <fris> here is a working version without a plugin http://jsfiddle.net/chrismccoy/qDNLG/
[18:06:21] <coldhead> aple: are you seeing the AJAX call firing in firebug/web inspector?
[18:06:58] <Bankzilla> fris try, $(this).live('hover', function (){
[18:07:54] <someprimetime> if i'm cloning a div with the same id, can i specify a new id name with the cloned div?
[18:08:11] <aple> coldhead: No
[18:08:21] <someprimetime> e.g. previous div was "#foo" new div would be "#foo-bar"
[18:08:34] <mightym> Bankzilla: yes, I'm using key press  found a way to convert the key-code to a char
[18:08:43] <mightym> Bankzilla: thy anyway!
[18:08:46] <aple> coldhead: It's a problem with the "time" var
[18:09:09] <fission6> what is that called anyways, lazy loading? infinite scrlling
[18:09:12] <aple> coldhead: I'm assuming it's not fetching the $time from ajax.php and returning it in any usable fashion :(
[18:09:30] <mightym> but richright now I'm looking to a possibility to apend a char to a textfield value, maybe someone has a hint?
[18:09:31] <fris> Bankzilla nope did nothing
[18:09:56] <mightym> richright = rightnow
[18:10:26] <aple> coldhead: Any thoughts on getting the $time var from ajax.php to update index.php?
[18:10:32] <aple> ..when the button is clicked
[18:11:02] <aple> coldhead: This doesn't seem to work: http://pastie.org/3043840
[18:11:43] <aple> $time is defined in ajax.php
[18:11:52] <aple> and index.php calls $.ajax
[18:12:16] <aple> I just don't know how to get that var from ajax.php back into index.php for display on success. :(
[18:13:36] <Bankzilla> aple: you've got it wrong
[18:13:44] <Bankzilla> data is what you send to the page, not what you receive
[18:14:05] <aple> Hm.
[18:14:09] <aple> So how do I receive?
[18:16:33] <aple> This is better: http://pastie.org/3043865
[18:16:52] <aple> But I get the feeling I'm missing how to encode JSON or call it in the success function.
[18:17:29] <coldhead> aple: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/523327/523325/
[18:17:40] <coldhead> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[18:19:10] <Bankzilla> coldhead does the ajax call return the entire page payload?
[18:19:23] <coldhead> i'm suggesting that it shouldn't
[18:19:31] <coldhead> because ajax.php implies JSON to me
[18:19:49] <coldhead> but it's seriously my first day using jQuery so pay me no mind
[18:20:03] <Bankzilla> I've only used ajax post to send to functions
[18:20:19] <Bankzilla> So I'm unsure on what it returns normally
[18:20:23] <mightym> thy anyway!
[18:20:56] <coldhead> Bankzilla: you can specify the dataType to tell jQuery what to expect back
[18:21:03] <aple> coldhead: I was actually trying that right before you sent, but data.foo isn't working either
[18:21:13] <aple> Firebug says, "data is null"
[18:21:19] <aple> Do I have to JSON encode it in ajax.php ?
[18:21:23] <coldhead> yes
[18:21:30] <aple> Ok, then it'll work?
[18:21:34] <aple> Hm
[18:21:39] <coldhead> and you have to provide the data param to your success function
[18:22:02] <coldhead> success: function (yoohoo) {... stuff will be yoohoo.whatever  in here }
[18:22:24] <aple> Yeah I feel ya
[18:22:53] <aple> Out of curiosity, is there a better way to specify the "data" property in my index.php?    data: 'task=' + task,
[18:23:08] <coldhead> see my comment above!
[18:23:12] <aple> Isn't there a way to get everything JSON encoded? Like    data: serialize or something?
[18:23:15] <coldhead> data: {task: task}
[18:23:20] <coldhead> that will roll it up for you
[18:23:24] <coldhead> all by iteself
[18:23:44] <aple> Ok, let me wrap my head around all this
[18:23:49] <coldhead> building query strings yourself is for chumps
[18:23:50] * aple gets coffee
[18:23:57] <aple> lol
[18:24:06] <aple> "query strings is for chumps!"

[18:46:44] <imsky> i think you're drunk 24/7

[18:49:09] <coldhead> i would wear the tshirt
[18:49:11] <imsky> lol
[18:49:19] <imsky> "the wigglers"
[18:49:20] <aple> coldhead, eddiemonge: http://pressedweb.com/example/ajax/    index.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523342/    ajax.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523343/
[18:49:23] <coldhead> yes!
[18:49:35] <imsky> abjorn: do you have any musical talent?
[18:49:37] <aple> (can't figure out how to jsfiddle AJAX) :)
[18:49:38] <imsky> you're like mexican
[18:50:20] <eddiemonge> aple:  that page is broken. heres how:
[18:50:35] <eddiemonge> 1. your list is sortable meaning the items can be placed ABOVE add
[18:50:50] <imsky> bayyy beh
[18:51:02] <eddiemonge> 2. the new list isnt saved so a refresh puts it back
[18:51:07] <imsky> want to freeze firefox? about:cache and list the disk cache entries
[18:51:15] <imsky> oh what fun
[18:51:16] <eddiemonge> 3. you are using alert as a debug
[18:52:05] <aple> eddiemonge: I'm not worried about the sorting part
[18:52:18] <aple> Enter some text into the textbox then click the add button
[18:52:22] <aple> It takes you to ajax.php
[18:52:27] <aple> Then you have to go back to index.php
[18:52:35] <aple> And refresh for it to show up
[18:52:49] <aple> I really just want to be able to add stuff asynchronously
[18:52:49] <eddiemonge> 4. task and time are undefined so the js fails
[18:53:09] <fructose> How would you tell a modal dialog to always remain in the center of the screen, even if the user scrolls?
[18:53:23] <aple> I thought they were defined starting on line 64: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523342/
[18:53:34] <imsky> add a scroll event to doc, and then adjust the modal accordingly fructose
[18:53:50] <eddiemonge> aple: data in ajax is data you are SENDING to the server so task and time in the ajax are wrong
[18:54:23] <eddiemonge> aple: data in the SUCCESS callback is the data you are RECEIVING from the server
[18:54:24] <aple> Ah, I see
[18:54:30] <aple> Ah
[18:54:33] <imsky> Oh
[18:55:08] <aple> eddiemonge: So "task" is being sent right? But "time" (since it's first defined in ajax.php) isn't being sent
[18:56:58] <eddiemonge> task isnt defined on that page
[19:02:02] <eddiemonge> aple: http://jsfiddle.net/ht54j/
[19:04:07] <aple> eddiemonge: Thanks man, but I still don't see what I'm doing wrong exactly
[19:04:15] <aple> $.ajax is just a verbose version of $.post right?
[19:04:21] <eddiemonge> yes
[19:04:27] <aple> Everything else seems the same except the data property in my version
[19:05:07] <eddiemonge> take that out
[19:06:05] <aple> Hm, now I'm getting an error in Firebug

[19:10:51] <muhoo> i'm looking for a good example  of a UI design pattern: entering something that may already exist
[19:11:13] <muhoo> like, say, a customer. it might already be in the db, but if not, i need to enter them
[19:11:41] <muhoo> there are so many ways to do it, it's making my head explode a little
[19:12:13] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: dojo? TRAITOR!!!
[19:12:16] <ryanneufeld> I kid
[19:12:22] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: enterprise software
[19:12:25] <ryanneufeld> oh
[19:12:28] <ryanneufeld> igh
[19:12:31] <ryanneufeld> *ugh
[19:12:38] <eddiemonge> lol not really but in theory dojo is better for our needs
[19:12:54] <ryanneufeld> I have friend who was deving with extjs
[19:12:54] <ryanneufeld> thaty'
[19:13:02] <ryanneufeld> *that's a mess
[19:13:02] <eddiemonge> in practice i find myself writing/wanting to write pure js and not even deal with dojo
[19:13:13] <dogarrhea2> ok
[19:13:13] <ryanneufeld> on some levels it might be easier
[19:13:23] <eddiemonge> extjs is actually not that bad. they just have a shitty license with a shitty history
[19:13:35] <dogarrhea2> so when i drag soemthing past a certain point, since jqueryui is totally broken, i've attempted a workaround of clamping the thing i'm dragging to some point
[19:14:00] <eddiemonge> extjs is/was actually easier to pick up than dojo.
[19:14:21] <dogarrhea2> but in my jquery code for the drag event, it's not doing ANYTHING if(parseInt($(this).css("top"))>84){$(this).css("top","84px"); }
[19:14:30] <eddiemonge> muhoo: what you said didnt quite make sense
[19:14:52] <muhoo> eddiemonge: it's hard to explain, but it's in like every app ever written
[19:15:05] <eddiemonge> try using different words/sentences
[19:15:11] <muhoo> i have to enter a person, say a customer.
[19:15:16] <muhoo> that person might already be in the db
[19:15:32] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: your parseint is missing the second param
[19:15:32] <muhoo> if they're already there, i want to just choose them
[19:15:39] <muhoo> if they're not there, i need to enter them.
[19:15:47] <dogarrhea2> no it's not ediemonge
[19:15:47] <muhoo> also if they're already there, i might want to edit them too
[19:16:02] <dogarrhea2> you can do parseint with 1
[19:16:09] <eddiemonge> muhoo: that would be an append or upsert
[19:16:21] <muhoo> it's not really a jquery question, it's a general UI question
[19:16:28] <muhoo> but in this case, i'd like to use jqueryui to implementit
[19:16:30] <muhoo> implement it
[19:16:30] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[19:16:42] <eddiemonge> "radix
[19:16:42] <eddiemonge> An integer that represents the radix of the above mentioned string. While this parameter is optional, always specify it to eliminate reader confusion and to guarantee predictable behavior.  Different implementations produce different results when a radix is not specified"
[19:16:43] <ryanneufeld> muhoo you want an insert .... on duplicate key update
[19:17:00] <muhoo> right, but the ui for it is the part i'm asking about
[19:17:01] <eddiemonge> muhoo: thats not UI. that has nothing to do with ui
[19:17:05] <dogarrhea2> either way, i figured it out
[19:17:09] <aidan> Anyone work with Drupal here? I want to hire someone to get Panels working with jQuery 1.7 in D6.
[19:17:18] <muhoo> how do i SHOW it, is my question?
[19:17:18] <dogarrhea2> i had to return false from the drag event and clamp before
[19:17:26] <ryanneufeld> what is it that you're trying to show?
[19:17:33] <eddiemonge> aidan: ill do it for $1000 an hour
[19:17:34] <muhoo> the old web1.0, html way would be a select box with existing customers, and maybe a button next to it that has "new"
[19:17:36] <ryanneufeld> muhoo: that you've created a new one?
[19:17:46] <muhoo> then the new would take me to a screen to enter a new customer
[19:17:55] <ryanneufeld> muhoo: you want an autocomplete?
[19:17:56] <muhoo> then save, then go back to the original screen, to finish the damn order
[19:17:57] <eddiemonge> muhoo: ok that is an entirely different question
[19:18:20] <muhoo> ryanneufeld: autocomplete is one way, sure
[19:18:29] <eddiemonge> muhoo: do you really want people to see existing customers?
[19:18:37] <muhoo> this is for a data entry person
[19:18:47] <muhoo> so, let's not say customers
[19:18:49] <ryanneufeld> muhoo: then auto complete would be the way to go
[19:18:55] <muhoo> since customers usually have their own login in a web app
[19:18:57] <ryanneufeld> or a filtered list
[19:19:07] <muhoo> ok, thanks. filtered list sounds good.
[19:19:07] <ryanneufeld> filter as you type sort of thing
[19:19:15] <muhoo> dropdown, like google search
[19:19:21] <ryanneufeld> autocomplete
[19:19:32] <ryanneufeld> is what you want if that's what you're after
[19:19:42] <eddiemonge> muhoo: like on facebook when searching? the new could be the "more results" link
[19:19:49] <eddiemonge> and that is autocomplete like ryanneufeld said
[19:20:06] <muhoo> eddiemonge: ryanneufeld: thanks
[19:23:54] <dogarrhea2> ugh
[19:24:06] <someprimetime> is it possible to keep the previous input values when cloning a form?
[19:24:11] <dogarrhea2> returning false from the drag event has the ugly side effect of not being able to drag back in the other direction
[19:24:15] <dogarrhea2> why can't jquery ui just work
[19:24:30] <imsky> because it's not very good
[19:25:54] <dogarrhea2> so what do i use for richer interactions then?
[19:25:57] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: it can. stop using return false. jqui is effin simple and easy to work with compared to dojo
[19:25:58] <dogarrhea2> do i mix dojo in with jquery?
[19:26:09] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge, it's broken
[19:26:13] <dogarrhea2> why are they rewriting it
[19:26:17] <eddiemonge> its not broken. youre code is broken
[19:26:31] <eddiemonge> they are optimizing it and standardizing.
[19:26:31] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge, the fact of the matter is taht the developers tell me its broken
[19:26:40] <dogarrhea2> and they are completely rewriting the interactions part
[19:26:42] <eddiemonge> which developers?
[19:26:48] <dogarrhea2> ajpiano
[19:27:02] <dogarrhea2> and the other guy with an afro
[19:27:09] <dogarrhea2> who is the jqueryui community manager
[19:27:19] <eddiemonge> scott
[19:27:44] <dogarrhea2> so.. i mind as well just use something else for now
[19:27:48] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez i mean
[19:27:54] <eddiemonge> but its not broken
[19:28:11] <eddiemonge> you probably arent using it right.
[19:28:34] <eddiemonge> yes they are writing stuff, but its to make it better. if it was broken, it wouldnt be up and used by so many people
[19:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: what's broken?
[19:28:58] <dogarrhea2> jquery ui draggable
[19:28:59] <someprimetime> jquery ui is too bloated
[19:29:01] <someprimetime> everyone knows it.
[19:29:03] <eddiemonge> so why not say what your problem is again and we can try troubleshooting it
[19:29:25] <coldhead> painful business
[19:29:26] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: have you looked at other ui frameworks? jqui is tiny compared to them
[19:29:34] <eddiemonge> tiny i say!
[19:29:48] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge there are even bugs on their demo pages
[19:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> it's true; it's bloated
[19:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> that's what the refactors and rewrites are fixing
[19:30:10] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: an ideal solution would be a shopping cart feature where i can pick and choose which plugins i want to use (with jquery ui) and then grab the code for only those
[19:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> and stability + extensibility + test coverage
[19:30:24] <muhoo> wow, the code for that FB dropdown is pretty elaborate
[19:30:33] <someprimetime> i've only used it once on a website for draggable, but having to go through and eliminate a bunch of stuff was a pain
[19:30:41] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: you do know there is a download builder to do just that right?
[19:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> someprimetime: that's what the download builder is
[19:30:50] <dogarrhea2> the download builder doesn't work
[19:30:55] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: didn't know abut that
[19:30:56] <someprimetime> about*
[19:31:02] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: what doesnt work about it?
[19:31:05] <someprimetime> is it fairly new?
[19:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: please stop saying things don't work without any actual examples or proof
[19:31:12] <dogarrhea2> let me go back and see
[19:31:14] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: yeah, about a few years old
[19:31:29] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: if download builder doesnt work, then i want to know so i can fix it
[19:31:56] <dogarrhea2> scott_gonzalez ok i'm going to do another example of a bug that i found in jquery ui since no one looks at the fucking bug tracker
[19:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> we have thousands of downloads every day, it's working
[19:32:07] <dogarrhea2> 2 in fact
[19:32:20] <dogarrhea2> on the demo page
[19:32:27] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: again, please stop throwing out incorrect facts. lots and lots of people look at the bug tracker
[19:32:32] <eddiemonge> every day, all day long
[19:32:56] <dogarrhea2> yes. i look at it every week to see how much longer it will stay there unnoticed
[19:33:02] <dogarrhea2> all the bugs
[19:33:11] <muhoo> dogarrhea2: if "nobody" looks at it, can you provide a link to the bug report of the unfixed bug you're talking about?
[19:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: if the bug is in draggable, the answer is it will stay there until 2.0
[19:33:12] <eddiemonge> what number?
[19:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> or you can send a pull request
[19:33:18] <rue> They just stare at the bugs, hour after hour?
[19:33:24] <imsky> i do that sometimes
[19:33:59] <dogarrhea2> ok. now i can move on to somthing else
[19:34:15] <someprimetime> to complain about?
[19:35:00] <aple> How can I serialize data in $.ajax?
[19:35:08] <eddiemonge> ?serialize @ aple
[19:35:08] <bot-t> aple, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: you do realize that we're in the middle of a complete rewrite for draggable, right?
[19:35:20] <dogarrhea2> i was busy explaining to eddiemonge
[19:35:27] <dogarrhea2> and he's like "no i't snot broken its you"
[19:35:36] <dogarrhea2> "no it's nto bloated it's you"
[19:35:46] <eddiemonge> bloated snot
[19:35:50] <someprimetime> lol
[19:35:50] <aple> eddiemonge: Just store that in a var and then pass that to data?
[19:35:51] <coldhead> lol snot
[19:35:52] <coldhead> hilarious
[19:36:09] <eddiemonge> aple: yes but if you have a key-value array, you can pass that directly
[19:36:17] <aple> var foo = $('#form').serialize();
[19:36:17] <aple> $.ajax { data: foo }
[19:36:21] <aple> Hm.
[19:36:30] <imsky> bayy beh
[19:36:52] <eddiemonge> aple: you. you could even skip the var if you arent using it somewhere else
[19:37:18] <aple> eddiemonge: Do I have to define each form field with an ID?
[19:37:29] <dogarrhea2> way to straw man eddiemonge, now that the developer has spoken about it actually being broken, do you admit defeat?
[19:37:37] <eddiemonge> aple: with a name at least.
[19:37:45] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: nope
[19:37:48] <eddiemonge> its not broken
[19:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: you haven't proven anything
[19:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> of course there are bugs
[19:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> blanket statements like "draggable is broken"
[19:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> are not at all helpful or meaningful
[19:38:17] <eddiemonge> i define broken as "MyLibrary"
[19:39:15] <dogarrhea2> i don't even need a js fiddle for this
[19:39:20] <dogarrhea2> because it's on the demo page
[19:39:21] <dogarrhea2> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/constrain-movement.html
[19:39:41] <eddiemonge> and i dont see where scott_gonzalez said it was broken. he did say bloated but thats subjective. it just needs to be tighter
[19:39:49] <aple> eddiemonge: Thanks man
[19:40:03] <eddiemonge> it needs to step on a scale, subtract 10 and then be that. not syaing it needs to lose weight
[19:40:04] <dogarrhea2> you see that thing that says "i'm contained within my parent"
[19:40:14] <dogarrhea2> resize your browser so a scroll bar appears.
[19:40:26] <dogarrhea2> drag that div towards a place where the document scrolls
[19:40:34] <dogarrhea2> not so contained within parent anymore hrm?
[19:40:48] <dogarrhea2> try using negative values in [x1,y1,x2,y2] so much unexpected buggy behavior..
[19:41:10] <dogarrhea2> grid snapping doesn't actually work
[19:41:14] <dogarrhea2> well i can go on
[19:41:16] <adoven> dogarrhea2: the beauty of open source is you could fix it yourself
[19:41:17] <dogarrhea2> but i don't get paid
[19:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> neither do we
[19:41:57] <coldhead> you get groupies
[19:41:57] <someprimetime> +1
[19:42:17] <dogarrhea2> i thought i saw a memo about "getting funding"
[19:42:47] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: thats not broken. thats buggy. and could be fixed without a lot of effort
[19:43:32] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: sometimes some people get paid when there is a huge urgency or sponsorship but its a trivial amount compared to the work done and most work is not paid at all
[19:43:54] <eddiemonge> group of volunteers who like helping people who arent assholes
[19:44:06] <eddiemonge> trying to make the web a better place to live
[19:45:22] <eddiemonge> if you want commercial software, check out ExtJS
[19:45:27] <dogarrhea2> anyways, if bugs don't get fixed it won't be a better place. people will equate open source with time sink/expensive
[19:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: are you paying attention?
[19:45:49] <dogarrhea2> yes it's in the process i know
[19:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> draggable is in the middle of a rewrite
[19:46:06] <dogarrhea2> the more it waits, the more people regret the lost time
[19:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> it's not waiting
[19:46:18] <dogarrhea2> there's no backtracking algorithm when it comes to spending time to learn soemthing
[19:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> what don't you understand?
[19:46:24] <eddiemonge> lol time sink/expensive
[19:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> we're actively working on it
[19:46:44] <eddiemonge> go write it on your own without a library and then say its a time sink or expensive
[19:47:09] <eddiemonge> time to move on. this is frustrating.
[19:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> well, technically, right now you're actively taking us away from being productive
[19:47:22] <dogarrhea2> i will roll my own draggable fo rnow
[19:47:28] <eddiemonge> who legitimately has a question?
[19:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> dogarrhea2: that's the opposite of helpful
[19:47:41] <tbranyen> eddiemonge: whats the best way to powerlevel swords in skyrim
[19:47:48] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: you are so -ot its funny
[19:47:55] <eddiemonge> tbranyen: simple. sell it and buy SWTOR
[19:48:01] <tbranyen> :D
[19:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> if you're going to invest time in draggable, why not work on the rewrite?
[19:48:11] <vladikoff> eddiemonge, bad game :X
[19:48:26] <systemfault> I'm waiting for Diabo3 :P
[19:48:32] <aple> Is it possible to run PHP code INSIDE of JS?
[19:48:38] <eddiemonge> aple: you are funny
[19:48:40] <someprimetime> aple: wat no
[19:48:44] <vladikoff> aple, you win !
[19:48:48] <aple> :D
[19:48:49] <systemfault> Eww PHP :/
[19:49:02] <imajes> hey, could anyone help me with a delegate issue?
[19:49:02] <imajes> https://gist.github.com/340b36aaaa0d2defe458#comments
[19:49:15] <eddiemonge> ?undelegate
[19:49:15] <bot-t> .undelegate(): Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[19:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> switching back to working on the new plugins site so I can actually be productive...
[19:49:38] <imajes> Yep
[19:49:51] <imajes> not sure that helps tho, eddiemonge?
[19:49:56] <eddiemonge> imajes: whats the problem?
[19:50:06] <aple> vladikoff: el juego
[19:50:10] <eddiemonge> imajes: oh that was for me. ive never used undelegate before
[19:50:14] <imajes> oh
[19:50:18] <imajes> i'm just trying all options here
[19:50:29] <eddiemonge> imajes: 1.7?
[19:50:33] <imajes> 1.6
[19:50:36] <imajes> 1.6.2 or something
[19:50:44] <imajes> trying to wrap all links with the class 'process'
[19:50:53] <imajes> to not go to their href, but do some ajax instead.
[19:51:02] <imajes> request that link via ajax, instead, to be clear
[19:52:09] <imajes> and i'm not sure i'm doing it right
[19:52:12] <imsky> wat
[19:52:30] <imsky> omg i will definitely get a pizza
[19:55:50] <eddiemonge> imsky: oh. there is no "document"
[19:56:00] <eddiemonge> theres document or "body"
[19:56:28] <imsky> i need some pizza to understand this
[19:56:43] <eddiemonge> i thought you couldnt afford it
[19:56:51] <coldhead> stop making trouble, imsky
[19:57:06] <imsky> how is "pizza is expensive" translated to "can't afford it"
[19:57:33] <imsky> vats of butterscotch are expensive
[19:57:36] <eddiemonge> ferrari is expensive = ferrari is not affordable by me
[19:57:39] <aple> How does one stop the submission of a form? I'm trying "return false;" to no avail. :(
[19:57:43] <imsky> that's faulty ass logic, eddiemonge
[19:57:52] <coldhead> >: |
[19:57:56] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ aple
[19:57:57] <bot-t> aple, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[19:58:04] <coldhead> talk more about butterscotch, imsky
[19:58:10] <coldhead> that makes me all puffy downstairs
[19:58:12] <imsky> boudroscotch, you mean, coldhead
[19:58:19] <aple> Cool, thanks eddie
[19:58:23] <coldhead> i don't know what that is
[19:58:27] <imsky> BOUDROSCOTCH: THE HAM OF CANDY
[19:58:48] <coldhead> ?g boudroscotch
[19:58:48] <bot-t> coldhead, No results found for 'boudroscotch'.
[19:58:57] <imsky> googlebomb?
[19:59:07] <coldhead> after you
[19:59:40] <imajes> eddiemonge: oh, that would make sense.
[20:00:17] <eddiemonge> what makes sense?
[20:02:20] <imsky> mrghorujngoern
[20:02:25] <imsky> calling pizza place
[20:02:30] <imajes> eddiemonge: i was doing $("document")
[20:02:31] <imsky> gotta finish writing github comments first though
[20:02:34] <imajes> so i am not surpriseid that won't work
[20:02:37] <imsky> $(document) imajes
[20:02:49] <imajes> but now i have fixed it and it's still not working right
[20:03:32] <imajes> imsky: i'm not sure if it even does the fn, since it seems to go to the href of that link
[20:03:39] <imsky> imajes: wat
[20:03:42] <imajes> rather than not do it
[20:04:02] <eddiemonge> imajes: live link or demo or it didnt happen
[20:04:43] <imsky> NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
[20:04:58] <imajes> ugh, i'wish
[20:05:01] <imajes> it's part of a stupid admin
[20:06:17] <imajes> hate this admin so bad
[20:17:28] <Chibby_> part of an admin? o_O
[20:17:38] <Chibby_> you need a scalpel
[20:22:56] <aple> Ok, I can't get this damn thing to stop submitting and sending me to ajax.php!! >:O
[20:22:58] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523363/
[20:23:06] <aple> I've literally tried everything known to man.
[20:23:20] <aple> Seriously, name any one thing. I've tried it.
[20:23:42] <aple> return false while riding a silverback gorilla through the Congo? tried it!
[20:24:11] <aple> event.preventdefault while synchronized swimming with a team of deaf-mutes? been there!
[20:24:41] <ndss56> aple: there is something wrong with your code.
[20:25:06] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523364/

[20:44:06] <imsky> dude
[20:44:08] <imsky> gtfo #jquery
[20:44:09] <Jakey> the photoshop troll
[20:44:27] <Jakey> imsky = troll
[20:44:27] <imsky> i seem to be garnering an anti-fanclub on freenode
[20:44:33] <imsky> qed right there
[20:45:00] <Dr4g> i'm adding jQuery and jQuerymobile logos there too
[20:45:04] <Dr4g> to the 'frontend' (top) part.
[20:45:12] <aple> :D
[20:45:22] <aple> Dr4g: HOW?!
[20:45:51] <Dr4g> jquery is there inheritly, bcoz jquery comes with it and i'm thinkig of clever ideas for content switching depending on the browser detection.
[20:46:05] <Dr4g> so you can make ur site for normal, and for mobile websites (using jquery mobile)
[20:46:10] <Dr4g> and it just 'auto-changes'
[20:46:12] <Dr4g> :)
[20:46:19] <Dr4g> if($this->is('mobile'))
[20:47:06] <imsky> what
[20:47:10] <imsky> is $this->is
[20:47:11] * aple no idea
[20:47:28] <aple> What's it called when the page is auto-updating all the time?
[20:47:40] <imsky> facebook
[20:47:54] <aple> Yeah, like how Facebook updates the "message" area when someone sends you a message
[20:48:09] <aple> What's that functionality called? And/or how is it accomplished in jQuery
[20:48:11] <Dr4g> imsky: well $this->is() is PHP functionality, since my project is PHP based (the middle PPI logo) and it has jQuery utilities surrounding it
[20:48:14] <aple> Does it ping the DB or something?
[20:48:23] <Dr4g> (boilerplate, modernizr, boilerplate..etc)
[20:50:16] <imsky> i dunno about either of those
[20:50:21] <imsky> abjorn: do you use boilerplate a lot?
[20:51:13] <abjorn> more or less
[20:51:14] <abjorn> yeah
[20:51:18] <imsky> :(
[20:51:20] <imsky> wat
[20:51:20] <imsky> why
[20:51:29] <abjorn> well
[20:51:31] <abjorn> less lately
[20:51:35] <abjorn> and when I do I like
[20:51:40] <abjorn> strip out so much
[20:51:40] <abjorn> lol
[20:51:47] <abjorn> I have a folder that's just a template that's like
[20:51:59] <abjorn> 30% of html 5 boilerplate
[20:52:07] <abjorn> and i just copy it for new projects
[20:52:15] <Dr4g> abjorn: that's the point me thinks :) I bundle boilerplate with the project, only keeping the Print styles and HTML structure.
[20:52:38] <Dr4g> and give bootstrap an option too
[20:52:43] <abjorn> I keep the reset and all and....well like...some of the beginning markup...and humans.txt and that junk
[20:53:49] <imsky> 0_o
[20:54:08] * imsky writes code by hand
[20:54:16] <imsky> after writing 'html5' and pressing tab of course
[20:54:17] <imsky> :D
[20:55:16] <abjorn> rofl
[20:55:24] <abjorn> yeah that's
[20:55:29] <abjorn> the hard way right there
[20:55:31] <imsky> hay
[20:55:35] <imsky> i wrote that code myself
[20:55:36] <imsky> dick
[20:56:06] <imsky> boilerplate kinda solves the wrong problem i think
[20:56:11] <abjorn> Delivery Estimate: December 21, 2011 - Monday, January 09, 2012
[20:56:12] <abjorn> that's a pretty wide fuckin margin there amazon

[20:56:28] <imsky> it's just two weeks brah
[20:56:46] <imsky> their logarithms are thinking "dec 31 is gonna be tough shit"
[20:57:05] <abjorn> >their logarithms
[20:57:14] <imsky> but not "are thinking"
[20:57:22] <abjorn> nope
[20:59:08] <imsky> i need to frigging get some food naow

[21:01:29] <imsky> i know
[21:01:37] <imsky> you stuff your fat face on the reg
[21:01:46] <imsky> it's hard for you to be vocal about it
[21:02:51] <coldhead> it's hard to be vocal because my gaping maw is crammed full of french fries
[21:02:51] <abjorn> BURRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
[21:02:52] <coldhead> yes
[21:02:57] <imsky> lol
[21:03:07] <imsky> #jquery is the opposite of #web
[21:03:18] <coldhead> i am banned from #web
[21:03:19] <abjorn> #jquery is now #eatquery
[21:03:31] <Dr4g> i'm banned from the web
[21:04:37] <imsky> #web degraded into a cesspool some time ago
[21:04:46] <imsky> used to have hundreds of people in it, now there's like 140
[21:04:58] <imsky> #jquery on a quiet night has 800 users apparently
[21:05:20] <Chibby_> i was going to make a "your mum" joke but thought better (:
[21:06:05] <abjorn> except you did make a your mum joke
[21:06:06] <abjorn> by saying that

[21:07:18] <ChrisPartridge> coldhead: tell her to make me some meatloaf
[21:07:33] <abjorn> ooh man we had the most delicious meatloaf for lunch today at work
[21:07:35] <abjorn> it was awesome
[21:07:58] <coldhead> i can't believe meatloaf is real
[21:08:10] <Behi> I have an array of $ wrapped elements in jquery, and I am calling fadeOut on them and obviously my callback is invoked multiple times. Is there a way to invoke the callback only after all of the elements are faded out?
[21:08:48] <imsky> meatloaf IS real
[21:08:58] <imsky> after so much time in merkah, i still don't believe it though
[21:09:11] <abjorn> dude meatloaf is awesome
[21:11:14] <imsky> loal omg pizza
[21:11:18] <imsky> why am i putting this off
[21:11:22] <imsky> i'm procrastinating on hunger
[21:14:27] <jeffmoss> how does a sortable calculate it's height?
[21:14:56] <jeffmoss> it's setting style="height:nnn;" anybody know how I can intercept this and get a stack trace?
[21:14:56] <imsky> idk ask santa
[21:15:05] <dr0id> santa is comin ina  few dat
[21:15:07] <dr0id> days
[21:15:19] <imsky> PIZZA PLACE IS NOT PICKING UP
[21:15:23] <imsky> fffffffuuuuuuuu
[21:15:40] <dr0id> hi i m sky
[21:16:00] <imsky> hello d r 0id
[21:20:13] <Radem> jQuery('#preview').click(function() {
[21:20:13] <Radem> 				process_request();
[21:20:13] <Radem> 			});
[21:20:26] <Radem> I have this and I get a null value for name="preview" why ?
[21:20:28] <dr0id> ...
[21:22:29] <Radem> I wait
[21:23:29] <dr0id> I wait too
[21:24:02] <kborchers> Radem: # is an id selector, thus it will not select an element by its name
[21:26:08] <abjorn> imsky: suxbro
[21:28:21] <Radem> how to select an elemant by its name ?
[21:28:44] <dr0id> getElementsByName
[21:29:27] <imsky> abjorn: yeah i'm gonna just order from another place
[21:30:10] <gloomer> jQuery('[name="value"]')
[21:32:25] <Radem> but how to link it with the id="preview" ?
[21:33:11] <abjorn> well, imsky bro, im goin to bed. tired as shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[21:33:19] <abjorn> later imsky and colhod
[21:33:22] <imsky> same abjorn take her easy soldja
[21:33:42] <abjorn> coldhead, colhod, same thing
[21:33:46] <imsky> codhead
[21:33:49] <imsky> trololol
[21:34:18] <gloomer> Radem #preview
[21:34:37] <gloomer> well i probably don't understand what your trying to do
[21:36:16] <Radem> I just want to enable my $_POST['preview']; for not being null
[21:36:27] <Radem> and keeps the value of it
[21:38:36] <gloomer> let me see ur code
[21:39:01] <dr0id> heh
[21:43:04] <rookie84> is it the same:
[21:43:12] <rookie84> var $name = "John";
[21:43:15] <rookie84> var name = "John";
[21:43:16] <rookie84> ?
[21:43:27] <rookie84> why is the $ sign before some variables?
[21:45:51] <gloomer> jquery variable
[21:45:55] <rookie84> ok i got it.
[21:46:42] <rookie84> gloomer: ok so its just to differentiate between javascript and jquery varialbes.
[21:47:38] <gloomer> jquery variables have different properties
[21:48:01] <gloomer> $variable = $('#Content');
[21:48:12] <gloomer> alert($variable.val());
[21:48:29] <rookie84> hmm ok
[21:48:32] <rookie84> thanks!
[21:48:52] <gloomer> makes it easier if you are doing lots of jquery
[21:49:06] <gloomer> instead of having whole $('Whatever') to have
[21:49:13] <gloomer> $thing
[21:55:58] <rookie84> hmm ok
[21:56:13] <rookie84> gloomer: var $liElements	= jQuery('ul li').get();
[21:56:25] <rookie84> i tried alert($liElements.eq(1).text())
[21:56:27] <rookie84> it didn't work
[21:56:37] <rookie84> but this worked: alert($($liElements).eq(1).text());
[21:56:50] <rookie84> that makes it no different ?
[21:59:50] <gloomer> loot at jquery site for get()
[22:00:03] <gloomer> its a GET/POST
[22:00:12] <gloomer> doesn't just get a DOM element
[22:00:53] <rookie84> hmm ok
[22:01:30] <gloomer> so you could do
[22:02:03] <gloomer> $liElements = $('ul lu');
[22:02:58] <gloomer> $liElements.each(function () { alert(this.text()); });
[22:04:48] <rookie84> hmm ok
[22:05:47] <rookie84> gloomer: i have a save function
[22:05:56] <rookie84> $('.save').click(function(e) { }
[22:06:16] <rookie84> i want it not to do the actual save thing if validation fails
[22:06:32] <rookie84> can i just quit the function if validation fails?
[22:06:39] <rookie84> or i'll need an if() else thing?
[22:07:37] <gloomer> sure
[22:07:55] <gloomer> or you could pop up some div's / text showing the user why validation failed
[22:08:45] <rookie84> yeh how can i quit the function, meaning how can i tell it not to execute things beyond this point(validation fails)
[22:10:47] <gloomer> well its usually handled by catching the validation error and doing something but if you just want to break
[22:11:05] <gloomer> use nested ifs
[22:11:08] <gloomer> or breakl
[22:11:11] <gloomer> break;
[22:11:53] <rookie84> ok
[22:12:42] <rookie84> <li><span id="save"></span><li>
[22:13:01] <rookie84> $('#save').parent('li');
[22:13:07] <rookie84> this is correct right?
[22:13:42] <rookie84> like for an immediate parent?
[22:14:53] <gloomer> ya but you don't need ('li')
[22:14:55] <gloomer> just parent will do
[22:15:12] <gloomer> $('#save').parent()
[22:15:32] <rookie84> ok if i specify the ('li') ?
[22:15:35] <rookie84> that won't do good?
[22:15:40] <gloomer> no that works too
[22:16:00] <rookie84> ok
[22:18:02] <dr0id> I wonder what happened to temp0[\d]
[22:27:11] <rookie84> any idea
[22:27:22] <rookie84> why would this be executed twice? : ui.item.children('.save, .close').click(function(e) { }
[22:27:27] <rookie84> its inside a sortable area
[22:48:07] <oojacoboo> can someone give me a hand here, please http://jsfiddle.net/36vLC/1/

[22:54:33] <oojacoboo> thanks man
[22:55:08] <Radem> hello I need help for a little problem worth 5$, if you are interested to help me..you can pm me
[22:55:16] <oojacoboo> dr0id: why did you set a var for $this?
[22:55:30] <oojacoboo> and why did you use it in one place and not in both
[22:56:26] <dr0id> both ? the same reason you had done scheduleInputs=$this.closest('ol').find('li.scheduled')
[22:57:32] <nsanden> http://jsfiddle.net/tjJG2/33/      how do i get stop() to work like i expect? I want to be able to click the first box many times quickly and have it stop any previous animations

[23:09:46] <coldhead> good old ChanServ
[23:10:34] <dr0id> looks good
[23:11:06] <Dr4g> dr0id: you don't think the top/bottom are contrasting themes?
[23:11:10] <Dr4g> coldhead: thoughts?
[23:13:28] <nisseni> I'm using the datepicker - a page has many persons, each user has two datepicker fields (from and to) with their unique ID, now I want the "to"-datepicker to only be allowed to start from "from" +1 any hints?
[23:15:11] <coldhead> i am a terrrible designer, Dr4g, sorry
[23:15:41] <Dr4g> coldhead: likewise :P
[23:15:44] <Dr4g> the arrows don't match
[23:15:57] <Dr4g> but the top 3 guys don't have a "Common Denominator"
[23:16:05] <Dr4g> such as psr-0, for the bottom 3.
[23:16:08] <Dr4g> know what i mean ?
[23:18:57] <coldhead> spluh?
[23:19:29] <nisseni> do I have to initialize one datepicker for each div or?
[23:20:15] <gloomer> jsfiddle an example of what your talking about nisseni
