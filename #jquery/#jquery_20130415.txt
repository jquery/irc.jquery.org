[00:01:41] <Dragooon_Mac> golden ratio?
[00:01:47] <coldhead> ?w golden ratio
[00:01:47] <b-ot> coldhead: found 8 cities searching for golden ratio, please be more specific!
[00:01:50] <bot-t> coldhead, Golden ratio - In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio
[00:01:58] <coldhead> thank you bot-t
[00:01:58] <bot-t> ;)
[00:02:02] <coldhead> NO THANKS TO YOU B-OT
[00:10:46] <Dragooon_Mac> coldhead: Have a look now
[00:11:42] <geNAZt> hi i am searching for a function in jquery that allows me to insert html content after the last match of a selector
[00:12:02] <geNAZt> insertAfter inserts after each match of the selector
[00:12:03] <Dragooon_Mac> geNAZt: $('selector:last').insertAfter()
[00:12:14] <Dragooon_Mac> Or use .last()
[00:16:23] <geNAZt> .last() works
[00:16:24] <geNAZt> thanks
[00:20:59] <coldhead> works for me Dragooon_Mac
[00:21:05] <coldhead> ship it
[00:22:37] <screamingbanshee> quoi?
[00:22:43] <screamingbanshee> window
[00:23:29] <coldhead> good chat
[00:44:33] <Cork> interesting <rip><blink></blink></rip> :)
[00:44:43] <Cork> all browsers has now dropped support for it :)
[00:44:55] * Cork dances on the grave
[00:45:28] <coldhead> maybe it's time for #jQuery to our own browser
[00:45:37] <coldhead> with all the classic tags of yesteryear
[00:45:53] <coldhead> <nobr><center><blink>lol</blink></center></nobr>
[00:46:12] <Cork> <font><img src="space.gif"></font>
[00:47:01] <Cork> man the web was broken back in those days...
[00:47:50] <coldhead> not like now
[00:47:53] <coldhead> oh no
[00:51:30] <fabioportieri> is this a good way to check if element exists in dom? $.isEmptyObject($("#idOfElementThatDoesNotExists"))
[00:51:51] <Cork> over complicated
[00:51:57] <Cork> $("#idOfElementThatDoesNotExists").length > 0
[00:52:08] <coldhead> Cork++
[00:52:25] <Cork> or !== 0 if you want to opposite
[00:52:54] <Eviltwin> Or just if ($("#idOfElementThatDoesNotExists").length) and if (!$("#idOfElementThatDoesNotExists").length) etc
[00:53:10] <fabioportieri> i see.. what's a good usecase for .isEmptyObject ?
[00:53:25] <Cork> $.isEmptyObject(options)
[00:53:38] <coldhead> assert( $.isEmptyObject( {} ), true)
[00:53:52] <fabioportieri> noted
[00:57:43] <Eviltwin> A jQuery object should really be treated more like an array with some extra methods, not like an object
[00:58:15] <ph88> when i have a piece of html with two input elements how do i put a <br /> between those with JS/jQuery ?
[00:59:08] <coldhead> do you really have to do that, ph88?
[00:59:16] <coldhead> can't you just use CSS to put them on separate lines?
[00:59:21] <coldhead> <br>s are very 1990s
[00:59:30] <ph88> hhmm you've got a point there
[00:59:45] <ph88> the case is that i have two checkboxes that need to be relocated  when clicked on a button
[00:59:53] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/KwY4G/
[00:59:55] <ph88> but the new place in the layout they need to be below each other instead of next to each other
[01:00:08] <Eviltwin> You really should use CSS
[01:00:09] <coldhead> .addClass('state-that-adds-display-block')
[01:00:48] <ph88> display block
[01:00:49] <ph88> nice
[01:05:53] <nabdev> i need to maximize my request ajax (data : data) i am work with PHP5.
[01:06:14] <screamingbanshee> what?
[01:06:35] <nabdev> i have pb with .serialize(); when i send a big number of form
[01:06:35] <Cork> nabdev: do you mean inspect json?
[01:07:02] <screamingbanshee> json_decode / json_encode problems?
[01:07:22] <nabdev> non data : $('form').serialize(),
[01:07:34] <Cork> ok?
[01:08:08] <Cork> are you looking for serailizeArray see ?.serializeArray
[01:08:09] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[01:08:15] <nabdev> when i have a big number of form in php part with $this->getRequest(); i can't find my form data :/
[01:08:40] <screamingbanshee> ok so you are using zend / mage?
[01:08:51] <screamingbanshee> does it return null?
[01:08:52] <nabdev> Symfony2
[01:08:56] <screamingbanshee> ok
[01:08:57] <nabdev> yes
[01:09:14] <screamingbanshee> ok what version php? please be precise
[01:09:18] <screamingbanshee> 5.3.x?
[01:09:38] <nabdev> PHP 5.3.10
[01:09:52] <screamingbanshee> you are probably having the json_decode bug.
[01:10:21] <nabdev> how can i resolved ?
[01:10:55] <screamingbanshee> the easiest fix is to ensure there are no non-printing characters (new lines, tabs, etc.) that end up in the .serialize() string that ends up being decoded by PHP
[01:11:00] <screamingbanshee> "easiest"
[01:11:08] <screamingbanshee> this bug makes baby Jesus cry
[01:11:34] <screamingbanshee> all 5.3.14 and lower are vulnerable to it in one or another form.
[01:12:06] <screamingbanshee> does this make sense?
[01:12:56] <screamingbanshee> if you can, use like JSON Lint or something before handing it to PHP, to ensure the json is ok.
[01:13:21] <nabdev> i check
[01:13:24] <screamingbanshee> ok
[01:13:44] <screamingbanshee> I'll link you to the bug reports in PHP, 1 sec
[01:16:31] <nabdev> empty array :/
[01:16:34] <screamingbanshee> yes
[01:16:42] <screamingbanshee> that is a sign of this bug.
[01:17:23] <nabdev> i must update my php version ?
[01:17:39] <screamingbanshee> if possible, that is the best.
[01:17:50] <screamingbanshee> at least 5.3.15
[01:18:21] <thomedy> okay... if someonif people are willing... can i ask for some opinions on my new storefront.. im not quite done yet cuz i can see some things i would like to add.. jus tnot sure how to add them yet

[02:07:33] <triptec> is there anyone who know of a css only mobile framework? I'd love the look of jqm but I really dont like the js part
[02:13:19] <seutje> triptec: the problem is that @supports is not a viable method for feature testing as of yet, so it would probably still need to rely on something like modernizr to see what's available and what isn't
[02:19:43] <triptec> seutje: I'm just talking about lists, buttons and things like that
[02:19:58] <triptec> a mobile css theme if you will
[02:22:44] <LG87> I'm using jQuery and jQuery mobile for mobile app dev. Anyone have tips, or links to some tutorials on how to make it a bit faster? It seems a bit slow.
[02:22:46] <seutje> triptec: guess u could use bootstrap and rip half of it out, but the CSS is usually what ppl change when using these frameworks in production

[02:26:23] <izual> Hi, I am trying to make a POST request to another domain through js but I get an error about the origin. However, the headers of the API I try to hit has the header cross-origin-allow: *
[02:27:22] <triptec> seutje: yeah maybe, but like bootstrap but with bigger li's and so on to make it more touch friendly so that one can mockup and have it not look like total sh*t
[02:28:09] <seutje> triptec: there might be frameworks for this, but I don't have a lot of experience in the rapid prototyping world
[02:29:51] <triptec> izual: don't your server have to allow the api?
[02:30:31] <izual> triptec, what do you mean? put an allow header on the side that calls the api?
[02:32:37] <moldy> hi
[02:32:43] <izual> I have added a Control-allow-origin: * also at the side calling the API

[02:41:09] <ph88> is it ok to put event handlers in a loop ?
[02:44:12] <ph88> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/341723/event-handlers-inside-a-javascript-loop-need-a-closure/341759#341759    how do i do this in jQuery ?
[02:44:50] <ph88> i have the same problem as that guy ... taking only the last values of the loop
[02:46:07] <fabioportieri> ph88: did you try the accepted answer?
[02:46:34] <ph88> i'm sure it works, i was just wondering if i could use special jQuery syntax, or if i shud just roll with the accepted answer
[02:46:58] <ph88> anyway this is about jquery and the syntax seems to be the same ... though still reading   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7774636/jquery-event-handler-created-in-loop
[02:49:49] <ph88> no wait that's different actually ^^
[03:00:20] <Nobita> hi, this is my page http://property.onesite.realpage.com/arapahoeclub/default.asp?brochure=1&propertyfpid=1 getting issue with IE since many comments are appearing there before <html> tag, is it possible for me to remove the comments on before the html tag using jQuery, if I'm able to do so will the page will again render automatically in Quirk mode in IE, since right now its rendering which I dont want
[03:01:40] <ph88> fabioportieri: found it http://www.bennadel.com/blog/534-The-Beauty-Of-The-jQuery-Each-Method.htm
[03:01:44] <discorpia> Nobita: the comments shouldn't matter, maybe specifying a doctype might help
[03:03:01] <fabioportieri> ph88: nice
[03:03:16] <ph88> yup i was trying to do normal javascript
[03:03:16] <fabioportieri> no need for closures afterall
[03:03:31] <ph88> yes i still like to understand these closures at some point
[03:03:33] <sunbeam> thanks seutje
[03:04:43] <Nobita> discorpia: please check, http://stackoverflow.com/a/4897850/969092
[03:11:06] <discorpia> Nobita: oh sorry, didn't know about that
[03:11:50] <seutje> Nobita: u could remove then with javascript, but that probably won't change anything
[03:11:54] <Nobita> discorpia: np :)
[03:11:58] <seutje> once u go quirks...
[03:12:24] <discorpia> yeah, the problem with removing them with jquery is that the browser have already read/parsed them and entered quirksmode unfortunately
[03:12:29] <seutje> Nobita: u can iterate over document.childNodes and check if their nodeType is 8
[03:12:39] <seutje> if it is, it's a comment node
[03:13:12] <code-ph0y> hey guys can someone put me in the right direction .. how do you implement a periodical function?
[03:13:20] <Nobita> seutje: ok, is there any way to using jQuery to change the mode of ie from quirk to ie 9 / 8 whatever, once the page is completely loaded ?
[03:13:36] <seutje> doubt it
[03:13:46] <Nobita> seutje: nodeType == 8, correct?
[03:13:48] <seutje> there's only a way to check if u are in quirks mode afaik
[03:14:23] <Nobita> afaik?
[03:14:33] <screamingbanshee> "as far as I know"
[03:14:34] <Nobita> ok
[03:14:37] <Nobita> got it :D
[03:14:38] <Nobita> :P
[03:14:56] <seutje> var nodes = document.childNodes, len = node.length; while(len--){ if (node[len].nodeType === 8) {} }
[03:15:02] <seutje> sry
[03:15:03] <seutje> var nodes = document.childNodes, len = nodes.length; while(len--){ if (nodes[len].nodeType === 8) {document.removeChild(nodes[len]);} }

[03:47:00] <ph88> how do i save a checkbox state when moving it around in the dom (by html) ??
[04:12:38] <sacho> why don't you move the element, and not the html?

[04:18:48] <pats_Toms> hi, about jquery ui draggable
[04:19:19] <seutje> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/PtpsQ/
[04:19:26] <seutje> check the checkbox and press the button
[04:19:26] <pats_Toms> us there any way how to add some other divs when I drag something?
[04:19:35] <seutje> it'll move it to the other div and retain state
[04:20:17] <seutje> pats_Toms: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper
[04:20:20] <ph88> seutje:  thx, this way it's visible http://jsfiddle.net/PtpsQ/1/
[04:20:44] <ph88> seutje: the problem i have now that the event handler stay as i want, but the wrong css is applied, i want it to inherent the css of the new parent
[04:20:49] <seutje> well I assumes u know how to inspect :P
[04:21:16] <ph88> inspect css ?
[04:21:38] <ph88> so i apply the right css classes ... hmm
[04:21:54] <ph88> seutje:  im using this now http://stackoverflow.com/a/10717422
[04:22:28] <seutje> doesn't it automatically get the styles? o.O
[04:23:25] <ph88> doesn't look like it
[04:23:32] <ph88> it keeps the style of the old position
[04:23:49] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/PtpsQ/2/
[04:24:05] <seutje> should only get a red outline after moving it to the target
[04:24:13] <ph88> hmm
[04:24:25] <ph88> ok thx i'll take this
[04:24:28] <ph88> and drop that js swap function
[04:27:35] <seutje> ph88: using the demo the guy provided, it still works: http://jsfiddle.net/NThjN/9/
[04:28:03] <ph88> seutje:  you are too fast for me :P
[04:28:08] <ph88> i'll have to test your previous script first
[04:28:45] <seutje> well don't straight copy/paste it, the selectors are incredibly unspecific cause I know it's the only checkbox in the page...
[04:28:59] <ph88> i thought appendTo was a copy function, not a move function
[04:29:02] <ph88> looks like a move function though
[04:29:09] <ph88> ofc
[04:29:15] <ph88> i have my own selectors ready
[04:37:14] <ph88> seutje:  thx very much, got it workking ... surprisingly there is not that much info on the internet about this as with other jquery things ^^
[04:39:03] <seutje> ph88: if u want to copy, u'd have to clone() and then append the clone
[04:39:30] <ph88> ye i DID read that !
[04:39:50] <seutje> but if ur doing that, make sure u check the docs on clone so u know what arguments to pass to also clone any event handlers on the element

[06:34:38] <pachet> not sure exactly what that means, but 1) use a list of anchors with hrefs corresponding to the id's of targets on that page
[06:34:51] <pachet> and 2) handler attributes are bad :[

[06:47:17] <Z3R0> well for one ....
[06:47:23] <Z3R0> you are loading popup BEFORE jquery
[06:47:31] <Z3R0> and if it relies on jquery, then you need to load jquery first
[06:47:38] <Guest59644> okey
[06:48:07] <Guest59644> i just uploaded a page called "test.php"
[06:48:26] <Guest59644> i can't get also a simple slideshow, i suppose the CSS is messing

[06:59:39] <Guest59644> I will insist a bit on this test I'm making for a slideshow, I did everything I could find on the famous s3Slider but it does not seem to work http://gotorsgames.com/creapub/site/test.php

[07:02:10] <pachet> yw
[07:02:25] <j3lte> Guest59644, you have not implemented the slider
[07:03:57] <Z3R0> Guest59644 yep, no slider.js file or w/e
[07:04:40] <Guest59644> Z3R0, j3lte I tried with a s3Slider.js and also the code in my page both does not seems to work
[07:04:43] <Guest59644> I modify it
[07:05:50] <chinoto> I have a dynamically loaded div (a "widget") that may be reloaded several times. It has an iframe and a form with a file input that posts to the iframe, I'm wondering what options I have to trigger a function from the iframe to the widget. My first idea was to bind a function directly to the page that would be call from the iframe as window.parent.myfunc(), but if the widget reloads, things might get messy (then again maybe not), and p
[07:05:50] <chinoto> eople tend to dislike global variables. The second idea was the attach an event handler to an element within the widget, but I didn't have any idea for how to trigger it from the iframe.
[07:05:51] <Guest59644> just called a s3slider.js, no result
[07:06:37] <Z3R0> hmmm
[07:06:41] <j3lte> implement it in the page again, let's start from there. I don't see it in <head>
[07:06:42] <Z3R0> I can't find a url link for s3slider.js
[07:06:44] <Z3R0> was oging to fiddle it
[07:06:56] <j3lte> can you paste the link again please?
[07:07:17] <Guest59644> gotorsgames.com/creapub/site/js/s3Slider.js
[07:07:29] <Z3R0> https://jqueryportfolio.googlecode.com/files/s3Slider.js // got it ;0
[07:08:28] <j3lte> Guest59644, implement that s3Slider linke Z3r0 says
[07:09:42] <j3lte> http://www.serie3.info/s3slider/ follow the instructions
[07:10:22] <Guest59644> i followed this tutorial, that is why I don't understand why it does not work
[07:10:31] <Guest59644> It's damn easy and I can't get it done
[07:10:52] <chinoto> gotta leave for work, seeya
[07:10:56] <j3lte> lol no you did it wrong
[07:11:41] <Guest59644> is my code wrong now ?
[07:11:41] <j3lte> because you need to paste that js code in a different javascript, AFTER you load s3slider.js and jquery
[07:12:05] <j3lte> that small js code to call s3slider.js is NOT the content of s3slider.js
[07:12:37] <Guest59644> oh I just understand NOW
[07:12:43] <Guest59644> i'm gonna kill myself ahahahah
[07:12:47] <j3lte> LOL
[07:13:06] <j3lte> good luck, if you can't get it done i'll explain
[07:13:58] <Guest59644> omg I feel so embarrased
[07:14:03] <Guest59644> now it works
[07:16:05] <j3lte> very good :)
[07:17:32] <Guest59644> guys, thank you so much
[07:20:42] <Guest59644> gotta go to pickup the children, have a good day. And thank you for your time
[07:38:15] <Niels___> i'm using .ajax to post and return some data for a cart, it works perfectly the first time, but after that the event handler doesn't get fired, anyone has a clue one what i'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/hL3v70qE
[07:39:27] <reuf> hello - i have a sitution http://jsfiddle.net/sfRgj/ - im truing to swap content of div element. when i click on button one i want to swap it with button 2 and this works well. but i also want now to click on button2 which was just added and change the content of another div
[07:39:29] <reuf> it wont work
[07:39:36] <reuf> the code is on that link
[07:40:12] <j3lte> Niels___ what browser do you use?
[07:40:31] <reuf> what am i doing wrong?
[07:42:34] <j3lte> reuf, that's easy, the click event is not bound to the button that you just created
[07:42:53] <reuf> j3lte: how do i bind it?
[07:43:00] <lejocelyn> hey, is a pdo query safe from injection or can you insert that with it ?
[07:43:02] <reuf> upon creation
[07:43:49] <j3lte> reuf: yes
[07:43:59] <Niels___> j3lte: chrome
[07:44:32] <reuf> j3lte: is there a way to bind click event upon creation ?
[07:44:33] <cardguy1000> I have a click function with a $.ajax({ type: "POST", url:myurl.php , data: $('#my-form').serialize()... inside of it, it does call the url and I'll get data back, but the php page does not seem to get any of the post variables.  if in myurl.php i have it print_r($_POST) it's an empty array
[07:44:56] <cardguy1000> I'm certain that the #my-form is the correct ID
[07:45:35] <j3lte> reuf : yes ofcourse --> $("#test1").html(div_data).find('button').click(function(){ /* click event bound to the button */})
[07:45:40] <j3lte> or something like that
[07:46:15] <j3lte> Niels___ is #updatecart part of .order-cart?
[07:46:17] <cardguy1000> I haven't used ajax before with POST data, so I'm not sure if the $('#my-form').serialize() is the correct way to submit POST headers to the php page
[07:46:31] <Niels___> j3lte: yes
[07:47:29] <j3lte> Than that's the problem Niels___, because you overwrite the html .order-cart, so than 'submit' is no longer bound
[07:48:13] <Niels___> j3lte: i see, what is the preferred solution?
[07:48:44] <reuf> j3lte: you are the king :D
[07:48:48] <reuf> j3lte: thanks
[07:48:59] <j3lte> no problem :)
[07:49:09] <lejocelyn> oups, wrong chanenel sory
[07:49:42] <j3lte> Niels___ don't overwrite the #update-cart, I would say ;-)
[07:50:24] <j3lte> can you paste the html-part of .order-cart as well?
[07:50:29] <Wolf_22> When using animate to adjust width, how do you control which direction easing uses? (I think that's asking it correctly--I'm just trying to make the animation "ease" to the right instead of to the left.)
[07:50:29] <Niels___> j3lte: well, that's kind of a problem.. because the update cart submit button is in the middle of the updated .order-cart, hmm
[07:50:29] <j3lte> alstublieft? ;-)
[07:51:26] <Niels___> j3lte: http://pastebin.com/Q4FxG26b
[07:52:16] <j3lte> cardguy1000, try to use serializeArray() ?
[07:57:08] <Niels___> j3lte: any clues? ;)
[07:57:44] <j3lte> this might work? not ideal, but does the trick i think: http://pastebin.com/tAkkXWT0
[07:58:24] <jquery_not_ok> hey i found i weird case with jquery mobile (last version)
[07:59:14] <jquery_not_ok> if the keyboard is visible and the user clicks outside, lets say on a button, the keyboard will close
[07:59:26] <jquery_not_ok> however, the layout doesnt update
[08:00:13] <Niels___> j3lte: doesn't work, it just submits the regular html form
[08:00:23] <jquery_not_ok> if the user closes the keyboard everything goes ok
[08:00:28] <Niels___> j3lte: what would be ideal? to get the submit button out of the dynamically inserted input?
[08:00:55] <j3lte> yes
[08:00:55] <Aha2Y> Is there a libary so you set unixtime (in my case uptime of server) and it dynamicly updates the unixtime by 1 second without having to refresh each time?
[08:03:02] <F1skr> Aha2Y: refresh what?
[08:03:18] <Aha2Y> The time
[08:03:21] <Aha2Y> look
[08:03:35] <Aha2Y> http://yiff.iotairc.net/
[08:03:43] <Aha2Y> How can i make that update dynamicly without refreshing?
[08:04:13] <F1skr> Aha2Y: do you mean refresh the page?
[08:04:17] <Aha2Y> no
[08:04:24] <Aha2Y> The value(uptime)
[08:05:43] <j3lte> i would say by using $.ajax to get the page every second, and just replace the html
[08:07:03] <Aha2Y> j3lte, Got a example or ussage of $.ajax/
[08:07:45] <j3lte> just have a look at jquery website, I don't have time to write an example, maybe someone else
[08:11:54] <fonko> guys, did anyone here used isotope plugin before?
[08:17:21] <four_tet> Hi, noob question, but what's the best way to find if any checkbox elements have been checked in e.g. a list?
[08:17:34] <pats_Toms> four_tet, google it
[08:18:11] <four_tet> wow thanks @ pats_Toms . I have
[08:18:37] <four_tet>  I think I can with each
[08:18:44] <Z3R0> you can with each four_tet
[08:19:10] <four_tet> jQuery('parentparentclassname input:checked').each(function() ... ?
[08:19:35] <Z3R0> $.each('.chkboxClass',function(checkbox) { if (checkboxed.attr('checked',true)) { // } });
[08:19:41] <Z3R0> or you can loop via the parent
[08:20:14] <four_tet> Z3R0: it's more just to return a count
[08:20:24] <four_tet> rather than having to iterate them
[08:20:25] <Z3R0> ah
[08:21:04] <Z3R0> var numberOfChecked = $('input:checkbox:checked').length;
[08:21:04] <Z3R0> var totalCheckboxes = $('input:checkbox').length;
[08:21:04] <Z3R0> var numberNotChecked = totalCheckboxes - numberOfChecked;
[08:21:26] <Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8011556/how-to-count-check-boxes-using-jquery // sorry but that was actually a pretty easy google find :)
[08:21:34] <four_tet> boom thanks
[08:21:35] <four_tet> :p
[08:21:41] <fonko> jquery in ie8 recognize if i use this? <a href="#" data-filter=":not(.transition)"> then  var selector = $(this).attr('data-filter'); ??
[08:21:50] <jquery_not_ok> my .on('taphold' is fired twice. but i guess i am doing something wrong here
[08:22:02] <Z3R0> jquery_not_ok please show code on jsfiddle.net
[08:22:15] <F1skr> So I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ws9g4/5/ are there any way to pass a dynamic number of arguments, based on the length of promises. Ie. in my example I "grap" a,b,c but if promises is 10 long, I miss 7 arguments..
[08:22:21] <Z3R0> fonko: Note: IE8 and earlier do not support the :not selector.
[08:22:24] <Z3R0> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_not.asp
[08:22:44] <jquery_not_ok> it fires after a while, as expected. and once i release the mouse
[08:22:59] <fonko> Z3R0, thanks
[08:23:13] <Z3R0> doens't help jquery_not_ok not without the code
[08:23:45] <fonko> so Z3R0 if i use data-filter and then try to get data from that attr... would work?
[08:23:47] <fonko> in ie8
[08:24:11] <fonko> because im having a really hard time with isotope and ie8 with some filtering stuff and cant figure out the problem
[08:24:35] <fonko> http://dev.warnermusic.com.mx (check "noticias" from the menu in your upper left)
[08:24:52] <Z3R0> if the browser supports data then you shouldn't have a problem
[08:25:02] <Z3R0> but you don't get the attr()
[08:25:04] <Z3R0> you get the data.
[08:25:11] <Z3R0> $().data('filter');
[08:25:58] <Z3R0> namespace!
[08:26:01] <Z3R0> ack wrong
[08:26:09] <fonko> interesting
[08:26:26] <Z3R0> sorry, the "namepsace!" was for #laravel lol
[08:26:32] <fonko> ha ok!
[08:31:29] <cardguy1000> j3lte, thanks.  Ended up being that a form was nested inside of a form and $('#my-form').serialize(); didn't like that
[08:37:15] <donics> is setting a textarea's value via .text() supported?
[08:37:49] <jquery_not_ok> Z3R0: http://jsfiddle.net/pPqJ5/
[08:38:20] <jquery_not_ok> however i dont know why the ontap is not working. never used jsfiddle before. maybe something is wrong
[08:38:49] <jquery_not_ok> "maybe" means definitely
[08:40:53] <jquery_not_ok> what i want to have is the event taphold to intercepted once and the click event to be ignored
[08:44:33] <momomomomo> jquery_not_ok: http://api.jquerymobile.com/taphold/
[08:45:08] <momomomomo> jquery_not_ok: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:49:41] <Zladivliba> hi guys
[08:50:06] <jquery_not_ok> momomomomo: i tried that example but the tap doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/pPqJ5/2/
[08:56:40] <csnytimes> Hello everyone how are you all doing?
[08:56:55] <csnytimes> I was wondering if I could get some jQuery help here
[08:57:08] <csnytimes> having some trouble with my click buttons
[08:58:53] <gnarf> `ask @csnytimes
[08:58:53] <b-ot> csnytimes: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:02:04] <csnytimes> gotcha sorry
[09:02:05] <lnostdal> hello guys, you talk about "please test" etc. but after you switched to 'grunt', building jquery (or jquery-ui) seems impossible....     doing e.g. grunt -version results in this nonsense:      throw new TypeError('Arguments to path.resolve must be strings');
[09:02:27] <lnostdal> getting sort of tired of it ..     build tools are totally uninteresting.....
[09:03:29] <csnytimes> I was interrupted at work... In any case... here is the flow of things for my newly created gallery ===> 1. click on next button (result: next image) 2. click on previous button (result: nothing happens) 3. click on (previous button again (result: previous image shows up)
[09:03:49] <csnytimes> I've never encountered this behavior before
[09:03:58] <csnytimes> I'm not sure what to do about it
[09:04:37] <csnytimes> I am using the .on('click', callbackfunction)
[09:05:10] <csnytimes> Can someone please help?
[09:06:31] <csnytimes> for my newly created gallery ===> 1. click on next button (result: next image) 2. click on previous button (result: nothing happens) 3. click on (previous button again (result: previous image shows up)... It shouldn't take two clicks for the button to work
[09:06:48] <csnytimes> I'm not sure what is causing this behavior...
[09:07:14] <Z3R0> csnytimes got code?
[09:07:29] <csnytimes> yep putting it into js fiddle now
[09:07:40] <Z3R0> nice ;)
[09:08:11] <csnytimes> http://jsfiddle.net/e2xgU/
[09:10:29] <code-ph0y> how do you get the text from a textarea?
[09:10:40] <code-ph0y> .val()?
[09:10:56] <pachet> yup
[09:17:09] <pats_Toms> hi again, I have random example here - http://jsfiddle.net/UNXeN/2/
[09:17:17] <lnostdal> never mind
[09:17:35] <pats_Toms> when I hover to "divi divi" this logs two nodes
[09:17:43] <pats_Toms> any ideas how to get only that first?
[09:18:25] <four_tet> On checkboxes again - I have I'm trying to check on click whether a checkbox was previously checked via jQuery(element).attr('checked'), but receiving checked every time
[09:18:44] <Z3R0> make sure you are using true and false four_tet
[09:18:59] <Raydiation> can i use :not for more than one class?
[09:18:59] <Z3R0> 'checked', 'checked' will always result in true
[09:19:11] <Raydiation> like .class:not(.class1,class2)
[09:19:22] <Z3R0> pats_Toms which do you want to color red?
[09:19:28] <Z3R0> viens or divi ?
[09:19:32] <pats_Toms> divi
[09:19:47] <pats_Toms> the child one
[09:20:08] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/UNXeN/5/ ?
[09:20:36] <Z3R0> that's not really working that well... though
[09:20:54] <Z3R0> because I assume of the div specs
[09:21:03] <pats_Toms> any ideas if I don't have that second class? http://jsfiddle.net/UNXeN/7/
[09:21:28] <four_tet> Z3R0: not sure how to involve false then if .attr('checked') will always return true
[09:21:41] <four_tet> jQuery(element).attr('checked') just returns "checked" every time
[09:21:58] <Z3R0> no
[09:22:08] <Z3R0> attr('checked') will show true or false...
[09:22:15] <Z3R0> but make sur eyour checkboxes are using true and false
[09:22:22] <Z3R0> and not attr('checked','checked')
[09:22:32] <four_tet> ah right I get you
[09:23:14] <Z3R0> one sec, all hell broke at work
[09:23:16] <Z3R0> brb in a bit lol
[09:23:36] <four_tet> Z3R0: actually...working now with  jQuery(element).is(':checked');
[09:23:44] <four_tet> even with checked=checked
[09:23:48] <four_tet> for input
[09:24:30] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/nKZ9B/ why is this giving me false? any ideas? is it the wrong usage of parentsUntil() ?
[09:24:58] <Z3R0> nice ;)
[09:25:00] <Z3R0> good to know
[09:26:24] <four_tet> Z3R0: :p

[09:31:12] <msoa> I have an element like this: 'id'=>'update-button'.uniqid()

[09:38:16] <Querty> Hey!!
[09:40:27] <Querty> http://jsbin.com/enuduk/1/edit
[09:47:13] <Querty> How can I to do for when the mouse is over the div stay show?
[09:48:33] <Remy> Querty
[09:48:42] <Remy> you need to add a library no ?
[09:51:25] <Querty> For what?
[09:51:35] <Remy> i mean
[09:51:45] <Remy> you're trying it on jsbin
[09:51:56] <Remy> but you need to tell jsbin to import jQuery
[09:51:58] <Querty> In my complete script I have added the jquery libraries!!
[09:52:02] <Remy> oh ok
[09:52:21] <Remy> when you import jQuery on jsbin for your example it works fine.
[09:52:56] <Querty> The problem is that show the hidden div and I'm going to select the div hide again
[09:53:10] <Querty> I need stay show while I overmouse over the div
[09:53:54] <Remy> you need #invisible-div to stay visible while you mouseover it ?
[09:54:04] <Querty> yes
[09:54:46] <Querty> Do you know how can I get it?
[09:54:52] <Remy> yes
[09:55:11] <Querty> How will be?
[09:56:09] <Remy> I would put the  #button-create-gen and #invisible-div   in the same div.
[09:56:35] <Remy> and then attach your hover handler to that div.
[09:57:03] <brookQuint> Can someone help me with this JQuery, I need the 2nd one to move options in a select list around. Moving Up works for 1 or multiple selected but down only works with 1 if I try to select 2 they dissappear. http://jsfiddle.net/K7nRS/
[09:57:30] <anli__> Is it possible to have multiple spaces when using option.text("foo    bar")? in some way?
[09:57:38] <anli__> I want the spaces to become &nbsp;
[10:00:06] <drager> This snippet; https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/autocomplete/jquery.ui.autocomplete.autoSelect.js doesn't work with jQuery 1.9.0. Do you guys any port? Or in anyway I can make it work?
[10:00:15] <drager> I tried .on() instead of .live()
[10:00:53] <anli__> Can I append instead of html to an option?
[10:00:58] <anli__> oops
[10:01:02] <anli__> Can I append text instead of html to an option?
[10:01:23] <Remy> Querty: http://jsbin.com/enuduk/7/edit
[10:06:13] <Remy> anli__: yo ucould write a quick replace to change your spaces to a nbsp
[10:06:36] <Remy> like
[10:06:47] <anli__> I already solved it the ugly way by puting text in a div
[10:07:00] <anli__> Is it ok to use <b> inside <option>?
[10:07:05] <anli__> Thanks anyway Remy
[10:07:13] <Remy> option.text( "foo     bar".replace(" ", "&nbsp") );
[10:07:17] <Remy> oh ok
[10:07:29] <tubbo> drager: if you want to update it for jQ 1.9, you'd need `$( document ).on( "blur", ".ui-autocomplete-input", ..`
[10:07:44] <brookQuint> Does anyone see something that would cause this to not work? http://jsfiddle.net/K7nRS/ when I move 1 down it is ok but if I try to move 2 down they dissappear.
[10:07:58] <tubbo> drager: sort-of a more explicit version of live(), which forces you to attach the event onto the document object and then "filter" the selector to what you originally selected in the live()
[10:08:39] <drager> tubbo: Changing it to that give me TypeError: autocomplete is undefined
[10:12:01] <Remy> brookQuint, do you have the html that goes along with it ?
[10:14:52] <tubbo> drager: hmm, not sure what to tell ya. you might need to rethin how it's selecting
[10:15:02] <tubbo> drager: might be time to look for a replacement plugin (or write one)
[10:15:13] <drager> tubbo: Haven't found one really
[10:18:03] <tubbo> drager: well you have 80% of the work done for you there, i'd just fork that plugin and try to figure out a better way of selecting
[10:23:05] <drager> tubbo: Alright, thanks
[10:23:20] <zizzl> Hey guys, anyone have a good plugin that can take <li>'s and put them in columns.. I want to have them flow top to bottom then continue to the top of the next column... There's a CSS3 way to do this, but it's not cross browser
[10:33:25] <zizzl> ^ anyone?
[10:36:36] <tw2113> css floating?
[10:36:57] <Remy> i dont know of a plugin, zizzl.. but it should be fairly easy to code.
[10:37:48] <Remy> you could break your ul into multiple uls
[10:37:57] <Remy> and float them
[10:38:03] <zizzl> tw2113, no float has it flow left to right
[10:38:06] <Remy> or w/e you need to do.
[10:38:16] <Remy> correct
[10:38:50] <Remy> that's why i suggest that you first break the your LI/ULs into multiple groups
[10:38:54] <Remy> and float those.
[10:39:06] <zizzl> ok
[10:39:53] <Memolition> zizzl: just try with jquery .slice() method
[10:40:02] <Remy> just write a function that takes a list and an integer. and start slicing your lis
[10:40:14] <Remy> yup
[10:46:43] <tubbo> zizzl: i just use `display: inline-block; list-style: none` if i want horizontal <li>s and shit
[10:47:31] <zizzl> yeah but I want them to list vertically and continue on the to next column based on a certain container width
[10:48:53] <Remy> zizzl:  what tubbo suggests will act as a float. so they will display side by side.
[10:49:25] <zizzl> yeah, not what I want
[10:49:29] <Remy> but the only way to have it behave exactly the way you want it is to first group them in separate groups
[10:49:38] <Remy> like i was saying earlier
[10:49:43] <Remy> do you want an example maybe
[10:49:52] <zizzl> true, I wish css 'column'width' was cross-browser
[10:50:03] <zizzl> because that does exactly waht I want..
[10:50:04] <zizzl> sure!
[10:50:17] <Remy> ok
[10:50:20] <Remy> let me see
[10:53:24] <fonko> did anyone here used ISOTOPE before???
[10:53:42] <fonko> im having a little issue with ie8
[11:04:23] <Memolition> zizzl: take a look at this -> http://jsbin.com/eqekow/1/edit
[11:05:06] <Dirkos> How come that console.log($('input[name="strStudentEmail"]').val()); returns the initial value and not generated one
[11:05:39] <bencbond_com> Hello I'm working on a jquery script that reads in this json feed http://www.broadcastonlineradio.com/stations?json . For some reason I can only get the first object. How do I go about getthing the other objects?
[11:06:11] <Remy> beat me to it Memolition  :)
[11:13:19] <bencbond_com> Anyone?
[11:15:03] <diamonds> is there a way to bind to "this elem not children"?
[11:15:11] <defaultro> anyone here does phonegap and jquery-mobile?
[11:15:15] <zizzl> Memolition, awesome thanks!

[11:15:33] <diamonds> http://pastie.org/7589023
[11:15:47] <diamonds> ^wondering if there's a more graceful way to do this
[11:19:35] <WebDragon> if I want to append three separate paragraphs to a var wrapper= $("#foo"); would I put them in as wrapper.append('<ul id="bar"/><p id="foobar"/><thing class="whateer"/>') ? or would I chain the separate appends together ?
[11:19:51] <WebDragon> I need to create them with the js instead of having them in the markup
[11:24:46] <Remy> either way
[11:36:49] <awc737> hey, I don't understand what the first line of this script is doing: https://github.com/bradvin/FooTable/blob/master/js/footable.sortable.js
[11:36:53] <awc737> (function($, w, undefined) {
[11:37:07] <awc737> what is that called?

[11:44:49] <pachet> ?g ben alman iife @ awc737

[11:45:16] <Remy> self executing anonymous function?
[11:45:22] <awc737> pachet, thanks, iife is what it is
[11:46:01] <Remy> awc737: is that what you are asking ?
[11:47:03] <awc737> yeah that was what had me confused
[11:47:08] <awc737> I want to right a plugin for Footables
[11:47:47] <awc737> it does sorting and filtering great, I need pagination
[11:48:50] <amph1bius> i always thought iife meant iffy, lol
[11:50:53] <awc737> lol
[11:53:40] <pachet> Remy: they don't have to be anonymous :o
[11:53:50] <pachet> (function buildApp(){ ... })()
[11:54:18] <pachet> and it's not really executing itself any more than any other function does
[11:55:26] <Remy>  right. good point ;)
[11:55:32] <Remy> thx
[12:00:13] <Z3R0> I know this is probably a stupid question... but how do people make their own "plugins" or whatever... like $.blockUI({ }); with custom arguments and things like ?
[12:08:00] <ravenzz> Z3R0 var $blockUI = function (options) {};
[12:08:39] <ravenzz> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:14:08] <yeadev> anyone have a free moment to look at page?
[12:14:58] <yeadev> trying to add a fancybox to a site i inherited.  code works on a clean webpage.  having trouble getting the slideshow to play on the live site.
[12:15:51] <Z3R0> ?
[12:15:54] <Z3R0> yeadev what's up?
[12:16:06] <yeadev> firebug is complaining about "TypeError: $ is not a function"
[12:16:17] <yeadev> i just need to get this simple slide show to work
[12:16:25] <Z3R0> looks like something is utilizing the $ and removed it from jquery
[12:16:29] <yeadev> sample page at yea.org/sandbox
[12:16:31] <Z3R0> look into noConflict()
[12:16:44] <yeadev> yeah i have noconflict enabled
[12:16:56] <mbor> hi, I have a bunch of elements added to a document fragment. how do I convert the elements to a jquery elements?
[12:16:57] <awc737> Is this defining one element to a variable? var $table = $(e.ft.table), $tbody = $table.find('> tbody'), $th;
[12:17:18] <yeadev> and changed all references in my scripts from $ to jQuery
[12:17:31] <Z3R0> yea I noticed that
[12:17:36] <Z3R0> so there's no $ anywhere?
[12:17:45] <awc737> is this an array? I don't get the commas. var $table = $(e.ft.table), $tbody = $table.find('> tbody'), $th;
[12:18:05] <yeadev> well theres a pile of JS that's installed by the previous author of the site.   i dont want to break stuff
[12:18:23] <Z3R0> does none of your above js need jquery ?
[12:18:34] <Z3R0> there's 4-5 js files above jquery
[12:18:34] <yeadev> supposedly she was using jquery too
[12:18:55] <yeadev> should i try moving jquery to the top?
[12:18:57] <Z3R0> yui-min, modules,js, utils.js, and obs_comp_rollup.js
[12:19:15] <Z3R0> couldn't hurt?
[12:19:34] <Z3R0> also why 1.7 ? got some old scripts?
[12:19:50] <yeadev> ok -- haven't tried that.  this site is driven by an AWFUL CMS called convio.  obscure is a nice word for it.
[12:19:55] <Z3R0> does it give any reference in console where the $ is messed up at ?
[12:20:09] <Z3R0> main.js
[12:20:13] <Z3R0> forgot I could view src
[12:20:13] <NoiseEee> yeadev: well it looks like YUI is used too.  one shouldn't be using more than one JS lib.
[12:20:33] <Z3R0> oh is yui a library ?
[12:20:36] <Z3R0> didn't know what it was
[12:20:37] <NoiseEee> yes
[12:20:41] <yeadev> the site was using 1.4 -- i installed 1.7 because fancybox still works with that wversion
[12:20:41] <Z3R0> ah
[12:20:59] <Z3R0> looks like yui already has fancybox included it it's main.js as well
[12:21:07] <Z3R0> fancyBox();
[12:24:11] <yeadev> no luck on moving jquery to the top
[12:24:32] <yeadev> still getting TypeError: $ is not a function http://www.yea.org/2012/js/main.js Line 4
[12:30:05] <blindMoe> yeadev: have you tried (function($) {   ?¬†
[12:31:24] <Z3R0> Anyone here about the explosions at the Boston Marathon 2013 ?
[12:32:32] <blindMoe> Z3R0: not until now... wonder what it was
[12:32:57] <Z3R0>  [WARNING] Images may be graphic http://hotair.com/archives/2013/04/15/breaking-explosion-at-boston-marathon/
[12:33:09] <Memolition> Z3R0: no
[12:33:32] <snover> Z3R0: off topic
[12:34:21] <Z3R0> point?
[12:35:53] <blindMoe> Z3R0: that is crazy.. had no idea it had even happened
[12:37:09] <air_> https://vines.s3.amazonaws.com/v/videos/2013/04/15/9000C854-1EDC-4F16-BFD2-1216BD16E309-1039-0000010027432EA9_1.0.7.mp4?versionId=Cj2e8IeN.sFllYxnTVEItFjPw7r8Bsyo
[12:38:14] <Z3R0> omg nice air_
[12:39:07] <yeadev> the modal loads -- just slideshow animation is failing :-(  so freakin' close to working
[12:39:16] <Z3R0> lol yeadev
[12:39:24] <Z3R0> still trying eh ?
[12:39:58] <blindMoe> yeadev: any errors being reported?
[12:40:15] <yeadev> im gonna rip this entire site out and replace with an actual CMS.  but in the meantime im getting paid to try to keep it working (if its is just barely working)
[12:40:59] <yeadev> still getting TypeError: $ is not a function http://www.yea.org/2012/js/main.js Line 4
[12:41:38] <blindMoe> did you try what I pasted?
[12:42:27] <Ortund> http://www.loganyoung.za.net/articles/file-download-with-asp.net/     ... I'm trying to hide the 2nd code sample for each code section (the ones that have "ByVal" in them), but whether I set .hide() or .css("display", "none") on them, they won't go away... can anyone help?
[12:43:33] <yeadev> @blindmoe -- crap missed your suggestion if it was for me
[12:44:31] <yeadev> did you want me type (function($) {   ?  in the console?
[12:45:25] <Z3R0> Ortund what are you trying to hide?
[12:46:09] <blindMoe> yeadev: no.. just add that $ in the first line of your main.js file
[12:46:18] <blindMoe> no guarantee that it helps but I think it may
[12:46:21] <blindMoe> bbiaf
[12:46:34] <Z3R0> just give a class to the table holding the code you want to hide, and hide that class?
[12:47:19] <Ortund> Z3R0, there are 4 code blocks (with horizontal scrollbars if you can't spot them otherwise)... I want to hide every 2nd one
[12:48:10] <Ortund> unfortunately, the damn syntaxhighlighter stuff is buggering around with the html I'm writing here
[12:48:15] <Ortund> ooooooo that gives me an idea
[12:48:18] <yeadev> so just add the $ between the parens or move the $ from the start of the line to between the parens? (sorry if im asking stupid qs)
[12:52:10] <yeadev> still getting TypeError: $ is not a function http://www.yea.org/2012/js/main.js Line 4
[12:52:40] <yeadev> maybe try renaming all the reference to $ in main.js to jQuery ?
[12:53:57] <Ortund> seems like you might be missing jquery altogether there yeadev... check your console to make sure the actual jquery library is actually being imported
[12:54:44] <yeadev> well -- the modal window is loading with the my button outside the frame.  so i'm pretty sure it's jquery is loading.
[12:55:45] <Ortund> hmmm yeah that's not the problem then
[12:56:02] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/nKZ9B/ why is this giving me false? any ideas? is it the wrong usage of parentsUntil() ?
[12:56:27] <NoiseEee> noregret: use .closest('table')
[12:57:18] <yeadev> hmm.. when i removed the noconflict from my source, the error changed to: TypeError: validation is not a function http://www.yea.org/2012/js/main.js Line 14
[12:57:29] <yeadev> not sure if that's progress or not
[13:02:20] <Onkeltem> I'd like to implement smooth scrolling using easing function. Can I do this simply?
[13:03:40] <Ortund> Z3R0 well something's happening when I click the C# button... not sure what to make of it though. It's hiding the VB ones, but it also seems to be stretching the height of the C# ones
[13:03:42] <Onkeltem> I already found some plugins, but I wonder can I do this using only jQuery and/or jQuery UI
[13:10:27] <noregret> NoiseEee: ok, that worked, but why didn't parentsUntil do it ? I don't get it
[13:26:25] <sarahfrantz> Trying to hide the contents of a tab until it is clicked on on page load... can't seem to get it to work
[13:26:54] <sarahfrantz> I want the tab panel to animated down to open when clicked on
[13:28:21] <Ortund> why aren't my show() and hide() calls working here? http://www.loganyoung.za.net/articles/file-download-with-asp.net/
[13:38:47] <jkuperus> When you use jquery mobile, should you also include regular jquery  ?
[13:38:52] <jkuperus> or is it a standalone thing
[13:43:04] <Z3R0> jkuperus: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4119672/do-i-need-to-include-jquery-core-alongside-jquery-mobile
[13:43:50] <jkuperus> Z3R0:  ah ok, thanks
[13:44:25] <jkuperus> i somehow always thought query mobile was a slimmed down jquery :)
[13:45:33] <Ortund> Z3R0 still getting nowhere on my show/hide issue... got any ideas?
[13:46:00] <Wolf_22> I've animated a div on focus but when I blur it the animation isn't eased... Why is this?
[14:08:38] <VadtecWk> i must be having a brain fart...how do I select the children elements of an element i mouse over?
[14:09:09] <NoiseEee> .find('something')
[14:09:39] <Onkeltem> I'd like to implement smooth scrolling using easing function. I already found some plugins, but I wonder can I do this using only jQuery and/or jQuery UI
[14:10:06] <VadtecWk> nevermind, i was having a brain fart...i figured it out
[14:10:25] <josephfisher> First time on IRC since '95.  Any jquery ascii art anyone?
[14:23:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ujiror/1/edit
[14:23:30] <Bloomberg> How can I get switch with that class

[14:27:59] <josephfisher> Nice!
[14:33:43] <Lucaszz> Hi
[14:34:14] <Lucaszz> Has everyone experience with tinzmce and eLfinder
[14:34:15] <Lucaszz> _
[14:34:17] <Lucaszz> ?
[14:34:27] <juboba> hello
[14:35:37] <juboba> I have several checkboxes in my page with name="addid[id]". What selector should I use to iterate over them? $('[name=addid]').each.... doesn't work
[14:38:55] <maahacka> Lucaszz: I have tried TinyMCE a long time ago, but not with eLfinder
[14:41:12] <Lucaszz> maahacka: I want to have absolute paths into tinymce textareas
[14:41:16] <Lucaszz> I have that config:
[14:42:15] <Lucaszz> http://pastebin.com/8UVM5ChS
[14:44:19] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here know of a way to listen for a popup window to be done loading?
[14:46:19] <maahacka> Lucaszz: I think you need to set document_base_url
[14:46:35] <maahacka> http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/TinyMCE_FAQ
[14:46:39] <maahacka> http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/url_conversion.php
[14:51:58] <Lucaszz> maahacka: Yes\
[14:51:59] <juboba> FunnyLookinHat, it is a popup?
[14:52:05] <Lucaszz> It doesnt works ...
[14:52:08] <juboba> FunnyLookinHat, ohh you said it
[14:52:14] <FunnyLookinHat> juboba, Yeah - targeting a popup with a form
[14:52:25] <juboba> FunnyLookinHat, then, you can use document.ready (same as any other page)
[14:52:29] <FunnyLookinHat> it's ugly - but the response is a PDF - and I need to make it nice and easy to print :)
[14:52:37] <FunnyLookinHat> Ohh - good idea.
[14:52:51] <juboba> haha
[14:53:32] <maahacka> Lucaszz: :( sry about that. I'm not much into TinyMCE :(
[14:54:27] <FunnyLookinHat> juboba, actually - looks like document.ready doesn't fire with popups as you might expect
[14:56:30] <juboba> FunnyLookinHat, ?
[14:56:59] <juboba> you have full control from the master page
[15:13:45] <tomshreds> Anyway of shrinking a string and add ... at its end quickly?
[15:13:52] <tomshreds> Please & Thanks :D
[15:18:00] <didiergm> in JQM what would be the best way to add a button at the end of an input element ?
[15:45:00] <alyis> I'm using $post to post a form and then append the resulting html to a div that is all working fine except some CSS and JS is not working correctly after I do this.
[15:45:33] <alyis> Any idea why this may be?
[15:45:34] <alyis> I.E. the resulting html contains a new form and 2 of the fields get styled correctly and the checkbox and dropdown do not.
[15:46:13] <Ungy> I have now heard it all some guy is talking about cloning the jQuery object to only work inside a specific div and he thinks this is a good idea.... either it is brilliant and I am just too tired or I have hit my stupidity threshold for the day
[15:47:51] <GunniH> can someone help me update span content with slider values?
[15:48:04] <GunniH> as in, when a slider value changes, the span content should change with it
[15:49:01] <Jackboy> Does anyone have a good example of AJAX / Server Side interaction using JSON responses to load pages / display errors?
[15:49:18] <Ungy> GunniH you mean you want teh size to change?
[15:50:26] <Ungy> Jackboy you want to copy someones work rather then try it yourself?
[15:51:06] <Ungy> Jackboy why not start one step at a time.
[15:51:15] <GunniH> Ungy, I mean that when I drag the slider from 50 to 100, I want to get 100 in a variable
[15:51:38] <Ungy> you want to know the current location of the slider?
[15:51:50] <Jackboy> I've got an implementation, Ungy, I'm just curious on best practice. My implementation returns a json object with STATUS (set to Error or Success) and then MESSAGE (if it was an error) or PAGE (if it was success, so it will redirect the user to that page through another JS function and change the hash / state)
[15:51:54] <GunniH> pretty much, yeah
[15:52:06] <Ungy> or is this a value based on the input slider hack?
[15:52:21] <GunniH> it's not
[15:52:35] <GunniH> basically if I'd do
[15:52:36] <Ungy> what slider are you using?
[15:52:48] <GunniH> just the basic jquery ui slider
[15:53:10] <Ungy> Jackboy well generally I don't redirect on a confirmed ajax call
[15:53:20] <GunniH> if I'd do var test = document.getElementById("slider"); it'd only get the value on page load
[15:53:28] <GunniH> but wouldn't be dynamic, it wouldn't automatically update
[15:53:31] <GunniH> when you slide the slider around
[15:54:08] <Jackboy> Ungy, well how would you go about loading the data into the content div then? Redirect is the wrong word, it basically runs $.content.load(returned_json_page_path) and then pushes a new state
[15:54:40] <Memolition> GunniH: have you tried .onChange jquery method?
[15:54:42] <Ungy> GunniH let me look at it but you woudl think there is a callback or an oncahnge event no?
[15:55:23] <GunniH> that's perfect Memolition, thanks
[15:55:31] <Ungy> Jackboy is ti really JSON or is it HTML being returned?
[15:56:20] <Jackboy> Ungy: I could return either, but if I just returned HTML, how would I know what to change the Push State (url hash) to ?
[15:56:30] <Jackboy> A different path is returned based on a custom code that gets generated, you see :P
[15:56:48] <Ungy> if it is JSON your probably going to bneed to build the hTML and then replace the .html() of the div if it's html you can just drop it in
[15:57:36] <Ungy> couldn't your pushstate be a hiddenvariable on the page you just update?
[15:57:58] <Ungy> that way you always know where it is and what it is
[15:57:58] <Jackboy> Hot damn, that's a great idea Ungy.
[15:58:20] <Jackboy> Because I need it as a hidden input anyway, cheers man, didn't even think of that :P
[15:58:51] <Jackboy> Damn. That would work for all sorts of pages, it could even be some sort of template variable I use. Thanks for the help there buddy :)
[16:04:49] <Ungy> some things are very simple don't over complicate is what I always say
[16:05:30] <Memolition> that's true man
[16:07:21] * Ungy as he sits here writing something way to complicated
[16:52:50] <coldhead> bro down and crush code
[16:56:31] <boytoy> coldhead: i thought it was girl down :/
[16:56:42] <boytoy> so u really is male huh
[16:57:05] <coldhead> it's really not important
[16:57:05] <Gazpacho> is there a jquery plugin to stop terrorist bombings
[16:57:35] <coldhead> Gazpacho: i think this could help http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-starwipe-plugin/
[16:57:58] <boytoy> no
[16:58:01] <boytoy> tons of people died
[16:58:07] <boytoy> and u had this whole channel fooled
[16:58:12] <boytoy> shame on u
[16:59:23] <gnarf> ?
[16:59:45] <coldhead> i doubt i've ever fooled anyone about anything
[16:59:52] <coldhead> straight shooter
[16:59:57] <coldhead> pragmatic business person
[17:01:40] <boytoy> well no homo or nothing
[17:02:01] <boytoy> but u helped me out on numerous occasions
[17:02:30] <boytoy> so u got my blessings but please tell everybody what sex u iiiiiiiiiiiiiis
[17:03:36] <coldhead> it's not really any of their concern
[17:04:02] <awc737> How can I do this:
[17:04:03] <awc737> if(typeof p.filter = $table.data('filter') || e.ft.options.filter.input == 'undefined'){
[17:04:04] <coldhead> if rmurphey were a woman, what would it change?
[17:04:07] <coldhead> nothing
[17:04:48] <boytoy> captain murphy?
[17:04:57] <coldhead> exactly
[17:05:10] <boytoy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4amEWUw6t4
[17:05:40] <boytoy> alright so u wanna keep the mystique, the spirituality, i can respect that
[17:08:00] <altin> I am using this script with fancybox 1.3.7
[17:08:09] <altin> I manage to change the url when the fancybox opens
[17:08:13] <altin> but when I close it
[17:08:17] <altin> the url still stays there
[17:14:29] <ertarded> so I have this weird issue with jquery's .on using a data param and losing scope in a closure for a predefined callback... putting together a jsfiddle example now, would love some input.
[17:25:45] <ertarded> nvm, sneaky typo.
[17:25:58] <Memolition> ?

[17:29:12] <tw2113> are you still here coldhead ?
[17:29:22] <boytoy> lulululuz
[17:29:29] <coldhead> in a sense

[17:37:59] <coldhead> daddy long legs are you proud
[17:38:15] <AlexZ> hey guys, i am trying to get a jquery object reference so i can get the .data() component, how can i get that from this that i get in a onclick callback?
[17:38:47] <coldhead> $(this).data('wevz'), usually
[17:40:45] <AlexZ> coldhead, i thought that woudl work, but it dosent, $("#myDivId").data() works, but not $(this).data()
[17:41:02] <AlexZ> this is in an onclick callback, its like its giving me the wrong reference almost
[17:45:29] <coldhead> like a rope gone slack
[17:52:02] <tw2113> woo! Spy Hard
[17:53:01] <AlexZ> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/AlexZan/sfVVM/
[17:53:04] <AlexZ> see it dosent work
[17:53:19] <AlexZ> $(this) dosent seem to get reference in an onclick callback
[17:55:41] <tw2113> eww, onClick handlers on divs, using alert to debug
[17:56:10] <AlexZ> tw2113, what do you suggest?
[17:56:15] <tw2113> ?on
[17:56:16] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:56:20] <tw2113> and console.log
[17:57:21] <AlexZ> tw2113, but how would u do that with a dynamic div?
[17:57:43] <Memolition> add a class to every dynamic div
[17:58:02] <altin> I am using this script with fancybox 1.3.7, I manage to change the url when the fancybox opens, http://pastebin.com/2H8tqEDc , but when I close it, the url still stays there
[17:58:03] <Memolition> and apply the .on() over the class
[17:58:06] <tw2113> do divs get click events by default?
[17:58:47] <altin> tw2113: me ?
[17:58:50] <AlexZ> Memolition, ahh gotcha
[17:59:07] <AlexZ> whats wrong with the onclick in the div?
[17:59:24] <altin> no only If I call them through url exc /page#user1
[17:59:48] <altin> otherwise /page doesn't open any div
[17:59:50] <tw2113> no, not talking about your issue altin
[18:00:13] <Memolition> tw2113: nothing you can use it
[18:00:57] <Memolition> tw2113: both do the same thing the same way
[18:01:01] <tw2113> ok
[18:01:57] <tw2113> hrm, i wonder of console.log isn't liking Aurora again
[18:04:46] <monteith> will it perform better to declare variables identifying elements individually, or to find a parent element and run .find(#foo) on them?
[18:06:18] <monteith> ie: div foo contains divs bar1, bar2, bar3.  better to use $foo = $('#foo'); $bar1 = $foo.find('#bar1') or $bar1 = $('#bar1'), $('#bar2'), etc
[18:07:12] <coldhead> selecting by ID is faster than using find(), in general
[18:07:23] <coldhead> but it doesn't matter much
[18:07:39] <coldhead> it's more important to save your $('selections') into a var and reuse them
[18:07:41] <monteith> but if i can afford to initialize them all individually before anything heavy happens, i should generally do so?
[18:07:48] <coldhead> rather than make jquery search fr the same things over and over
[18:08:08] <coldhead> mm, hard to generalize
[18:08:13] <coldhead> depends on what "heavy" is happening
[18:08:23] <monteith> scroll-based animation
[18:08:52] <coldhead> yes, if you're worried about that lagging then select every ahead of time
[18:08:59] <coldhead> everything*
[18:09:19] <monteith> cool, appreciate it.
[18:15:36] <coldhead> THE KISS GOODNIGHT
[18:17:01] <GunniH> is there a slideLeft() and slideDown() like there is slideUp() and slideDown()
[18:17:04] <GunniH> rr
[18:17:10] <coldhead> no
[18:17:11] <GunniH> is there a slideLeft() and slideRight() like there is slideUp() and slideDown()*
[18:17:15] <GunniH> hmh ok

[18:17:22] <coldhead> you can make your own very easily
[18:17:44] <GunniH> that animates and does display: none?

[18:29:15] <AlexZ> hey guys, something weird is happening, im adding dynamic divs to a parent div, and It seems the first one i ad, when top/left = 0, its at the top left corner of the parent (with relative positioning) but the 2nd generated div, at top 0, is about 30 away from the top of the parent (30 is also its width if that is a clue)
[18:36:51] <cincyguy5646> using jquery, can you set focus to the last character in an input field..?
[18:41:08] <tdignan> cincyguy5646: a quick google seems to give the impression that you can
[18:41:32] <coldhead> someone in my dictionary's up to no good / i can never find the very special words i should
[18:57:14] <ragas> ajax_load is part of jQuery 1.91?  I keep getting ajax_load is undefined.  http://jsfiddle.net/VCrHz/
[18:58:23] <coldhead> ajax_load is just something you've made up
[18:58:29] <coldhead> it's not "part" of jquery
[18:59:24] <anew> lol
[19:01:14] <ragas> maybe someone made it up, but it wasnt me: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/5-ways-to-make-ajax-calls-with-jquery/
[19:01:34] <coldhead> if you copy the rest of their code it will work better
[19:02:01] <coldhead> it's like you're just picking a few words out of shakespeare at random and saying "I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PLOT, THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, WHAT IS A 'SCAMEL' ANYWAY?!"
[19:02:40] <ragas> did you look at the link i posted, or are you just out for a good flogging?
[19:02:51] <tw2113> that's also nearly 4 years old ragas
[19:02:55] <coldhead> i have never looked at a link in my life
[19:03:00] <coldhead> i'm hardly about to start now
[19:04:02] <coldhead> var ajax_load = "<img class='loading' src='img/load.gif' alt='loading...' />";
[19:04:04] <tw2113> ragas, the only time i see ajax_load is when it's as a variable
[19:04:11] <Gazpacho> ragas: he's right, you are copying code without any effort at understanding it
[19:07:37] <ragas> ok thanks. i thought it was a method.
[19:10:36] <xboi209> How do i get jquery to click an alert that has "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons?
[19:11:00] <abjorn> :o
[19:11:06] <abjorn> you dont
[19:11:30] <coldhead> window.alert = function () {return true;}
[19:11:40] <abjorn> rofl
[19:11:40] <coldhead> wait
[19:11:43] <ragas> lert.js
[19:11:46] <coldhead> window.confirm = function () {return true;}
[19:11:54] <screamingbanshee> lawl
[19:12:10] <abjorn> build in alert/confirm/etc is a blocking event, so even if there was an api into it you wouldnt be able to do anything while the window is up
[19:12:11] <coldhead> it might work, YOU CAN'T PROVE IT DOESN'T
[19:12:28] <abjorn> blocking operation, rather, i should say
[19:18:48] <coldhead> great chat guys
[19:18:54] <coldhead> let's take a short break
[19:25:36] <abjorn> coldhead: way ahead of you bru
[19:29:22] <coldhead> i think if you right click on a page while it is still loading it should crash your gombuter
[19:45:21] <rien> hey folks, I need some easy help here: http://jsfiddle.net/8wgFj/
[19:45:50] <rien> just trying to retrieve a json from a ruby function
[19:47:08] <rien> doesn't need to be json, just any string will do
[19:48:05] <Gazpacho> you're missing a comma between null and function, aside from that, what problem are you having
[19:52:09] <Gazpacho> hmph
[19:55:04] <rien> hmm I actually just fixed it by using $.get which is simpler. thanks anyway!
[19:55:16] <Gazpacho> hmph
[20:01:24] <GunniH> anyone here a jquery mobile expert?
[20:02:59] <thinkerweb> GunniH, bad edicate, should ask to ask, just ask.  Nobody gonna come jumping in begging to help, except me, but I am no expert
[20:03:07] <thinkerweb> plus I am into bootstrap
[20:03:11] <coldhead> etiquette*
[20:03:21] <thinkerweb> coldhead, haha, what did I spell?
[20:03:27] <GunniH> edicate :>
[20:03:42] <GunniH> figured I'd ask, my problem being that I want to use the jquery mobile slider since I need the slider functionality it offers
[20:03:44] <thinkerweb> coldhead, I think it goes both ways
[20:03:54] <ralxz> hey guys. i'm doing a jquery .click on a div, but when i click on the div's margin it triggers the click call
[20:03:57] <thinkerweb> GunniH, so use it
[20:03:57] <GunniH> but I don't want the full page to be turned into <html class="ui-mobile"> etc.
[20:04:01] <ralxz> is there any way i can make it so it doesnt count if i click on the margin?
[20:04:18] <GunniH> thinkerweb, it automatically forces my whole <html> and <body> tags to take a jquery mobile class
[20:04:28] <GunniH> quite annoying since I only want that one feature from it
[20:04:43] <thinkerweb> GunniH, hmm, maybe should just find a slider plugin instead
[20:05:22] <thinkerweb> GunniH, maybe a custom package with just the slider will prevent it from doing all the class stuff to you html and body elements
[20:05:29] <thinkerweb> GunniH, did you try a custom download?
[20:05:38] <GunniH> yes, the problem being that the custom download for 1.3.1 is broken
[20:05:50] <GunniH> try it yourself, it's timeouting

[20:05:51] <b-ot> GunniH: Issue #49 by julianxhokaxhiu (1w 12h ago): Download builder is offline
[20:06:31] <ralxz> I have a jquery .click on a div, but when i click on the div's margin it calls the click function. is there any way to not call the click on a click of the margin? any way i can check within the function?
[20:06:43] <thinkerweb> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[20:07:27] <thinkerweb> ralxz, easy thing is to wrap a div and make set margins on wrapper div instead
[20:07:43] <GunniH> yes thinkerweb, if you read what I said, it's currently offline and not working
[20:07:53] <GunniH> hence my link: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/49
[20:07:53] <b-ot> GunniH: Issue #49 by julianxhokaxhiu (1w 12h ago): Download builder is offline
[20:07:58] <GunniH> ^
[20:08:05] <thinkerweb> ralxz, although, I'm not sure if the margin is supposed to be clickable, maybe you have some other mistake.  But I have no idea really, to be honest, lol
[20:09:21] <thinkerweb> GunniH, still, I just loaded it fine
[20:09:29] <GunniH> I realize that
[20:09:30] <ralxz> thinkerweb: hm it's a div with margin:0 auto;
[20:09:57] <GunniH> the error occurs when you hit the "Build My Download" at the bottom
[20:10:12] <thinkerweb> GunniH, yep, I can confirm, I tried to download, nothing
[20:10:19] <GunniH> the devs know about it, and are working to fix it as far as I know
[20:10:26] <GunniH> but that github post was a week ag
[20:10:32] <thinkerweb> GunniH, hmm, we gotta wait then eh
[20:11:04] <thinkerweb> GunniH, your kidding, but so many people are using jquery mobile.  Even Adobe released a new program customized for it; fireworks.
[20:11:41] <thinkerweb> ralxz, hmm, you have some right and left margin eh, wrap it then, probably do the trick
[20:19:53] <aro_> what plugin will create tall equal columns
[20:20:00] <aro_> similar to pinterest
[20:20:26] <coldhead> aro_: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[20:20:31] <aro_> thanks :)
[20:21:22] <coldhead> enjoy
[20:25:28] <rien> is it possible to have a link make a post request?
[20:25:59] <rien> I'm missing something here... when I have a button do a post request inside a form, I can't do ajax because clicking "submit" causes the page to actually go to that resource
[20:42:54] <rien> how do I send a form without having the form submit? just retrieving the result of the post request?
[20:43:30] <maahacka> rien: what do you mean by "without having the form submit"
[20:43:47] <rien> I want to use ajax to update stuff on the page; don't want the page to reload
[20:44:28] <rien> maahacka: http://jsfiddle.net/zHcVx/
[20:44:42] <maahacka> you have to read out the values of the form elements and make an ajax call to the server
[20:45:14] <rien> can you look at my code and see what I'm doing extra that is causing the form to submit?
[20:46:12] <ralxz> is this broken for anyone else? http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[20:46:21] <ralxz> select some random stuff, press build. i don't get any response
[20:46:25] <rien> also my alert never gets called
[20:48:42] <maahacka> yes I see the alert is not calle
[20:48:43] <maahacka> yes I see the alert is not called
[20:49:00] <maahacka> rien do you have FireBug?
[20:49:24] <rien> yes
[20:49:30] <maahacka> when you do this in the browser and hit Esc immediately after you click "search" do you see an error?
[20:50:00] <maahacka> maybe there is an error in the function that makes it stop and then the browser switches to a normal behaviour
[20:50:20] <coldhead> and the blanket's real loud
[20:50:37] <rien> no I don't see an error
[20:50:50] <maahacka> is tags defined?
[20:51:03] <maahacka>  var dataString = 'tags='+ tags;
[20:51:22] <rien> maahacka: <input name="tags" id="tags" type="text" size="80">
[20:51:24] <rien> that's all
[20:51:51] <Gazpacho> your whole script isn't running
[20:52:54] <Gazpacho> http://jsfiddle.net/zHcVx/3/
[20:53:40] <rien> why isn't it running?
[20:54:02] <Gazpacho> because you had a syntax error and didn't fix it
[20:54:02] <clouder`grr> there's an unexpected ; rien
[20:54:25] <rien> where?
[20:55:08] <clouder`grr> the object your passing to the ajax() call doesn't need the trailing ;
[20:56:18] <rien> can you be more specific?
[20:56:38] <clouder`grr> chrome's console told me about the error, not sure which console you are using if any
[20:56:52] <maahacka> rien: there
[20:57:06] <maahacka> after text.data));
[20:57:08] <rien> oh, the } that matches 'success'
[20:57:08] <maahacka> on the next line
[20:57:21] <maahacka> yes
[20:58:25] <clouder`grr> ooops I was wrong maahacka got it ;) I even misread it lol
[20:58:55] <rien> okay, the POST request still doesn't get done
[20:59:19] <rien> oh it does now
[20:59:26] <rien> wow javascript throws no freaking errors
[20:59:38] <rien> I was missing 'data' in: success: function(data){
[21:00:20] <maahacka> when the exception is thrown within a callback function
[21:00:30] <maahacka> it rarely shows the exeption
[21:32:42] <kevireilly> Hola. Does anyone have any recommendations for storing persistent data on the client side that is cross browser and tastes delicious?
[21:34:58] <snover> localstorage is pretty cross browser and delicious.
[21:35:26] <kevireilly> snover: i do find localStorage pretty scrumptious, but it is only supported by modern browsers yah
[21:35:55] <snover> if by modern you mean ie8
[21:39:27] <kevireillyy> snover: sorry, my internet is the dooks
[21:39:38] <snover> ?ud dooks
[21:39:42] <bot-t> snover,  Dooks  - Basically, sex. Dook, or dooks means to have or be up for sex. Can also be meant in the sense of being attractive, as "Dooks" comes from Daisy Dukes (Played by Jessica Simpson)
[21:39:56] <kevireillyy> whoa
[21:39:57] <snover> i don‚Äôt really need to know what your internet gets up to
[21:40:06] <kevireillyy> i meant it to be short for dookie, but that works also
[21:40:55] <kevireillyy> hrm caniuse.com sez ie8 is a no go
[21:41:09] <coldhead> i could have told you that
[21:41:35] <kevireillyy> this seems kind of sensual https://github.com/jeremydurham/persist-js
[21:42:12] <Lucky--> kevireillyy: amplify and most storage libs have that built in
[21:43:06] <Andrew_R> http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage
[21:43:20] <Andrew_R> IE8 shows support
[21:44:18] <kevireillyy> oOo so. I've been MIA for too long
[21:46:53] <coldhead> welcome back
[21:49:37] <kevireillyy> Andrew_R: iStoopid. I think I was looking at geolocation instead of localstorage because that was also on my mind ;)

[22:06:43] <coldhead> have you seen php.js? they might have implemented PHP's "loops" in javascript for you
[22:06:49] <coldhead> i haven't tried though
[22:06:57] <defaultro> k
[22:07:06] <abjorn> or you could just do it the javascript way?
[22:07:13] <abjorn> which wouldn't be terribly different
[22:07:32] <defaultro> maybe pull from a template file then use .html()
[22:07:34] <abjorn> other than the idea of inserting elements rather than doing it inline
[22:07:47] <abjorn> is it the *same* <section></second> repeated a bunch of times?
[22:07:54] <defaultro> yes
[22:07:57] <abjorn> just clone it

[22:08:23] <defaultro> but i need to change id like <section id="page1"></section>  <section id="page2"></section> and so on
[22:08:41] <defaultro> will look into clone
[22:08:49] <abjorn> you can do that in the loop p ez

[22:14:34] <defaultro> it's cool, learned new things today :)
[22:14:40] <abjorn> that's always good
[22:14:47] <coldhead> you learn new things every day, defaultro
[22:14:48] <defaultro> what does this mean, node;
[22:14:51] <defaultro> i do
[22:14:53] <coldhead> you're venerabilis inceptor
[22:14:59] <abjorn> just declares a variable called node
[22:15:03] <defaultro> coldhead, I built my first phonegap this morning :D
[22:15:26] <abjorn> I'd suggest looking through a primer on javascript, get yourself familiar
[22:15:31] <coldhead> well i am learning from you today
[22:15:37] <coldhead> i learned that you can do loops in JS
[22:15:41] <defaultro> lol
[22:15:42] <coldhead> this will come in handy
[22:15:44] <abjorn> it's coldheads first day
[22:15:50] <coldhead> no more copy pasting for me!
[22:16:04] <defaultro> our humble coldhead friend :)
[22:16:06] <abjorn> bot-t has some link to a good quick js tutorial i just cant remember what it is
[22:16:16] <abjorn> maybe coldhead miraculously knows it even though its his first day
[22:16:29] <coldhead> ?js101
[22:16:30] <bot-t> 101
[22:16:32] <defaultro> i know coldhead, he's helped me before
[22:16:34] <coldhead> oh thanks bot-t
[22:16:38] <coldhead> that used to be better
[22:17:18] <abjorn> http://jqfundamentals.com this has a decent primer on JS at least
[22:17:26] <abjorn> and goes through jQuery stuff so that's cool too
[22:17:27] <defaultro> k
[22:17:58] <coldhead> and it's written by our own mr rmurphey
[22:18:10] <coldhead> so you can PM him directly with your questions
[22:18:12] <abjorn> as you get deeper into whatever you're doing I'd encourage you to try and familiarize yourself with both javascript and jquery as much as possible - without proper knowledge of JS, jQuery can hurt as much as it helps
[22:18:20] <coldhead> anytime, day or night, he's here to help
[22:18:33] <defaultro> abjorn, i have a question about your declaration. I got confused with the commas
[22:18:37] <abjorn> o coldhead you deviant you
[22:18:41] <abjorn> yeah sure
[22:18:48] <defaultro> i = 1, n = 25,
[22:18:50] <abjorn> you can declare multiple variables with one var statement
[22:18:57] <defaultro> ah :D
[22:18:59] <defaultro> very cool!
[22:19:00] <abjorn> basically thats all one statement, just separated on multiple lines
[22:19:16] <defaultro> rather than var i = 1; var n = 25; etc
[22:19:26] <defaultro> thanks bro
[22:19:54] <abjorn> yeah exactly
[22:20:28] <defaultro> what's the reason for not adding var i = 0 in for loop?
[22:21:05] <defaultro> i mean, for (i = 0; i < n; i++) ....
[22:21:41] <abjorn> personal preference i guess, doesn't matter
[22:21:47] <defaultro> k
[22:31:53] <Gazpacho> defaultr: abjorn is wrong, the reason is either that i is already declared or the code is wrong
[22:32:22] <abjorn> >mfw he didn't look at the code
[22:35:14] <Cork> abjorn: the code is correct, but what Gazpacho said is true too
[22:35:22] <Cork> abjorn: you simplified the reasons too long
[22:35:47] <abjorn> i said it was already declared
[22:36:03] <abjorn> thats about as much explanation as that needs
[22:36:10] <Cork> what's the reason for not adding var i = 0 in for loop? | personal preference i guess, doesn't matter <--
[22:36:20] <Gazpacho> pfft contxt got lost in all these dumb join messages
[22:36:23] <Cork> that gives the wrong impression
[22:36:48] <abjorn> yeah gazpacho lol
[22:37:05] <abjorn> "(12:13:32 AM) abjorn: well set i's value in the var statement so"
[22:37:22] <Gazpacho> afk
[22:37:30] <abjorn> it was explained, he was asking why I did it that way instead of declaring i in the for statement
[22:37:46] <abjorn> in which case, yeah saying it's preference is the explanation
[22:37:50] <Cork> abjorn: what i meant is make sure to express things like that clearly, cause it can cause loads of errors for ppl if its miss understood
[22:37:55] <coldhead> it's weird how it's called for and not loop
[22:38:12] <coldhead> misunderstood*
[22:38:16] <abjorn> because
[22:38:18] <abjorn> coldhead
[22:38:20] <Cork> opps
[22:38:21] <coldhead> miss understood is a charming lady, don't bring her into it
[22:38:21] <abjorn> reasons
[22:39:02] <coldhead> i love how chrome's debuger can't step into window[something]()
[22:39:06] <abjorn> lol
[22:39:07] <coldhead> that really yanks my chain
[22:39:22] <coldhead> SERIOUSLY NO ONE WOULD EVER NEED TO DO THAT
[22:39:35] <coldhead> no one would ever need to debug some massively over engineered "widget"
[22:39:39] <abjorn> obviously not or the great and powerful google would have made it possible
[22:39:40] <coldhead> EVER
[22:39:57] <abjorn> hey look
[22:39:58] <abjorn> coldhead
[22:40:06] <abjorn> IF YOU DID IT THAT WAY
[22:40:08] <abjorn> IT'S YOUR FUALT
[22:40:12] <abjorn> </caps>
[22:42:31] <defaultro> abjorn, need help again, http://jsfiddle.net/K3TjE/2/
[22:42:31] <tw2113> stop the shouting! i hear voices when people shout
[22:42:51] <abjorn> are the voices shouting?
[22:43:22] <defaultro> it's not updating it properly. The contentTarget is being updated on the section rather than the <div>
[22:43:32] <defaultro> i think my node.attr is wrong
[22:43:38] <abjorn> it is
[22:43:42] <abjorn> you're setting id three times
[22:43:45] <abjorn> ?attr
[22:43:46] <b-ot> abjorn: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[22:43:46] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:44:06] <abjorn> so id is gonna be the last value you set there
[22:44:22] <defaultro> i tried div#id, it didn't work
[22:45:18] <abjorn> wat
[22:45:26] <abjorn> oh sup gnarf
[22:45:32] <abjorn> what do you mean defaultro
[22:45:48] <defaultro> if you look at my code, I want to update the other 2 ids
[22:46:01] <defaultro> atomNewsTopic1 and contentTarget1
[22:46:27] <abjorn> that's not like at all how you do that
[22:46:28] <defaultro> this code  "node.attr("id", "contentTarget" + (i + 1));" updates the id in <section
[22:46:40] <abjorn> you gotta select those elements from the node
[22:46:45] <defaultro> k
[22:47:00] <abjorn> so like, node.find("#atomNewsTopic1").attr("id", .....
[22:47:22] <defaultro> k
[22:47:45] <abjorn> man i should
[22:47:48] <abjorn> probably sleep at some point
[22:47:53] <abjorn> but im not that tired
[22:47:53] <defaultro> :)
[22:50:34] <defaultro> it worked
[22:51:30] <abjorn> whaddyaknow
[22:54:30] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/K3TjE/5/
[22:54:33] <defaultro> thanks :D
[22:54:42] <abjorn> werd 2 ur muthr
[22:54:46] <tw2113> yes abjorn
[22:55:15] <abjorn> tw2113: that's probably a sign that the text to speech IRC plugin I installed on your computer is working
[22:55:23] <tw2113> ohhhhhhh
[23:02:36] <abjorn> Yep, it's time I headed to bed
[23:02:53] <Gazpacho> good night sweetheart, well it's time to go
[23:12:09] <mitchdotpro> Hey guys - n00b question. How do I get .on() to behave more like .live() used to? I am doing far too many .off() and .on() calls to attach, re-attach and avoid double bindings. Is there any way to get the .live() behaviour in 1.9?
[23:19:01] <Andrew_R> mitchdotpro: use .on() syntax like this $('#container').on('click', '#morespecific', function)
[23:19:14] <mitchdotpro> Ahh right, like bind
[23:19:27] <mitchdotpro> It seems to bubble a lot which is annoying
[23:19:41] <Andrew_R> this attaches an event handler to a higher level element (something that will always be there), but only take action if the second parameter matches
[23:19:56] <Andrew_R> it does rely on bubbling
[23:20:03] <Andrew_R> they call this event delegates
[23:22:53] <Gazpacho> doesn't the documentation for .live explain exactly how to migrate?
[23:24:30] <Gazpacho> why yes it does
[23:28:34] <mitzev_> on safari my jquery code isnt working
[23:28:49] <mitzev_> its simple show/hide classes on mouse in and mouse out
[23:35:35] <Gazpacho> sorry to hear that
[23:36:39] <mitzev_> :)
[23:42:40] <Gazpacho> mitzev: do you know about jsfiddle.net
[23:54:34] <coldhead> tw2113: ping
