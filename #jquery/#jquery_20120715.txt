[00:18:29] <ragas> > a = Date().split(" ")[4]; a = a.replace(":","_");
[00:18:57] <ragas> >> a = Date().split(" ")[4]; a = a.replace(":","_");
[00:19:14] <ragas> why does it only replace the first : ?
[00:19:40] <systemfault> ?js a = Date().split(" ")[4]; a = a.replace(":","_");
[00:19:43] <bot-t> systemfault: "12_49:39"
[00:20:03] <systemfault> ?js a = Date().split(" ")[4]; a = a.replace(/:/g,"_");
[00:20:26] <systemfault> Anyway...
[00:20:34] <systemfault> The bot sucks but my snippet should do it.
[00:22:00] <ragas> so it does :)
[00:36:03] <MACscr> anyone know how to use ajax post tests in jsfiddle? Im trying to put together an example so we can test my code =P
[00:37:08] <abjorn> MACscr: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html#json
[00:37:35] <abjorn> /echo/json
[00:37:41] <abjorn> all it does is echo back the json you give it
[00:39:13] <MACscr> so just replace the post url with /echo/json?
[00:39:19] <MACscr> i tried, but no luck http://jsfiddle.net/TS3UC/
[00:40:12] <raj> is it possible for javascript to mess up?
[00:40:24] <raj> a class was supposed to be added to an element, and wasn't
[00:40:38] <raj> just this once, it's never failed before
[00:40:48] <raj> no errors on the page or anything
[00:40:55] <raj> code is correct
[00:41:17] <abjorn> MACscr: code error on there
[00:41:21] <abjorn> Uncaught ReferenceError: error_element is not defined
[00:41:38] <abjorn> error.insertAfter(error_element);
[00:42:21] <abjorn> raj: Do you mean is it possible for it to be a bug in the JavaScript engine? Sure, it's software like anything else, but it's more likely an error in your code.
[00:43:09] <abjorn> Or it could be a jQuery bug, but it's still more likely to be in your code.
[00:45:02] <coldhead> the bug is most likely in the code with the fewest unit tests
[00:45:17] <abjorn> ^
[00:45:23] <systemfault> :D
[00:46:02] <abjorn> man I have a whole slew of code for work that needs unit tests...I really should do that at some point.
[00:46:18] <MACscr> abjorn: any ideas what that error_element might be about? Its part of a third party script that im trying to troubleshoot. I would assume thats supposed to be working with the jquery validation plugin that i have linked in that jsfiddle
[00:46:18] <abjorn> but it's not very fun :(
[00:46:36] <abjorn> take a closer look MACscr
[00:46:40] <abjorn> errorPlacement:Â function(error,Â element)Â {
[00:46:41] <abjorn> Â  Â  Â  Â Â error.insertAfter(error_element);
[00:46:41] <abjorn> Â  Â Â }
[00:46:44] <abjorn> don't see anything wrong there?
[00:48:34] <MACscr> im assuming its supposed to be error.insertAfter(error,Â element); ?
[00:49:35] <coldhead> abjorn: it's much more fun if you do the tests first
[00:49:44] <Whirl3d> personally, I have found that the likelihood that a person's code is in error vs jquery or javascript being in error is directly proportional to the number of times jquery or javascript has been accused of being in error by the coder.
[00:49:45] <coldhead> and you watch them slowly go from fail to pass
[00:50:05] <MACscr> looks like that worked. Now to see why that function doesnt even seem to be running in my real code
[00:50:15] <Whirl3d> remember when you point a finger at something, there's usually at least 3 pointed back at your own faulty  code...or something like that
[00:50:20] <systemfault> I don't do DOM testing.. fuck that shit.
[00:50:45] <MACscr> hmm, dev tools doesnt even show an event listening for the form. wth
[00:53:31] <MACscr> ok, so js loaded on the main page would apply to elements loaded through XHR, right?
[00:56:07] <abjorn> coldhead: Yeah that's what I've heard. That would be a lot easier if the company I work for had ever heard of the concept of planning shit out before starting on it.
[00:56:47] <coldhead> hahaha, it's a fine theory, non-existent practice
[00:56:53] <abjorn> lol exactly
[00:57:48] <twinturbo> hey
[00:58:04] <twinturbo> anyway to do http streaming with a callback per chunk?
[01:04:17] <MACscr> was my question that dumb about XHR? Just trying to troubleshoot the issue with the limited knowledge that i have with js. The event listen is showing up correctly when i tested it with jsfiddle, so the only difference between the two would be that the form is loaded through XHR
[01:10:50] <mikeumus> Hey Gang
[01:11:16] <mikeumus> my alert goes off and no errors but nothing is appending to navID
[01:11:18] <mikeumus> var navCity = document.createElement('img'); 			navCity.setAttribute('src', 'http://c15132695.r95.cf2.rackcdn.com/nav-city_410.png'); 			navCity.setAttribute('alt', 'city scape black line drawing above main menu'); 			document.getElementById('navID').appendChild(navCity); 			alert();
[01:11:49] <mikeumus> any advice in any direction would be great. I'm finally learning js and am super excited about it
[01:12:51] <mikeumus> nothing seems wrong with the above, I think it's just a bummer
[01:13:22] <mikeumus> it's inside of this mess: http://373.be/waio/
[01:14:29] <mikeumus> I run a small Wordpress shop in New Jersey (http://mdm.cm/) and have js wizards on the team but they're sleeping and I'm on Adderall pulling an all nighter trying to catch up on some stuff.
[01:15:27] <mikeumus> it's cool
[01:16:23] <mikeumus> Adobe Shadow is really neat by the way. I suggest checking it out for mobile dev if you use Chrome Inspector as home base.
[01:16:34] <mikeumus> extra neat.
[01:16:36] <MACscr> mikeumus: setup tests in jsfiddle.net. Makes it easier to troubleshoot
[01:16:41] <mikeumus> alright
[01:16:46] <mikeumus> thought so
[01:16:50] <mikeumus> give me a min
[01:19:08] <mikeumus> yeah scaled down it's even failing me: http://jsfiddle.net/Mikeumus/tsW67/
[01:19:13] <mikeumus> interesting
[01:19:49] <mikeumus> opps: http://jsfiddle.net/Mikeumus/tsW67/1/
[01:20:09] <mikeumus> ok so that worked, hum..
[01:20:21] <MACscr> ha
[01:20:40] <MACscr> btw, that little jslink button will help ya find simply syntax errors as well
[01:20:47] <MACscr> er, jslint
[01:20:59] <nickhs> Hi there! I'm just starting out with jQuery and I think I've got myself awfully confused. I have a list which I am trying to add elements to (using append, data from a getJSON call). Now each list element is quite complicated (3 divs and a span) - is the best way to insert it to simply write out the whole html and then use string concatenation for the changes from the data?
[01:22:44] <nickhs> or is there some way to load the HTML from somewhere else? Is that design pattern even logical? Having giant HTML strings in your js code doesn't feel right.
[01:23:05] <mikeumus> now the tricky part, and why I mentioned Adobe Shadow, is that I'm testing for no SVG enviroments (like Android's default browser) which I can't do that I know of in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Mikeumus/tsW67/3/
[01:23:27] <mikeumus> got some nice native js that checks for the SVG support though and I've tested that, know it's good
[01:23:46] <MACscr> nickhs: store as much as you can in other files to keep things clean, then just load through XHR
[01:24:16] <mikeumus> via SVG WEB: http://svgweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/UserManual.html
[01:24:43] <nickhs> MACscr, so keep the html string in a different file and just GET it? Won't another request slow everything down?
[01:24:58] <mikeumus> so I'm testing in Adobe Shadow, which is pretty nice, but no clue why my node isn't appending inside that SVG check.
[01:25:03] <MACscr> well you said it was a lot
[01:25:04] <nickhs> (and then I still have to do a replace or split the string somehow to insert the variables)
[01:25:49] <MACscr> im not a js expert, so i might not even be visualizing your issue correctly
[01:27:29] <nickhs> I have a <ul> which I want to add <li>'s to. Now currently I just loop through the json and do $('ul').append(<li><div class=foo>{name}</div>..some other crap with variables</li>)
[01:28:04] <nickhs> but the html string is awfully long and it looks bad just sitting in the middle of the html code. Is there a better place to stick it or load it?
[01:28:40] <nickhs> I mean in the middle of the javascript code
[01:29:20] <MACscr> why does the list need to be created with js anyway? why not do that server side?
[01:29:56] <MACscr> mikeumus: shadow would be cool if you actually didnt need to have the devices =P
[01:30:02] <MACscr> until then, not so much
[01:30:58] <mikeumus> yeah MACsrc, I need a iOS device
[01:31:13] <mikeumus> I just have my handy(but getting old and glichy), Droid 3
[01:31:26] <mikeumus> I waited 2 years for the Droid 3 and then a few months later the Droid 4 comes out?
[01:31:30] <mikeumus> lol
[01:32:04] <mikeumus> I think my whole issue is just a matter of wrapping my SVG check in a jQ.ready()
[01:32:39] <mikeumus> yeah man mobile is the new browser compatibility issue, not the browsers as much anymore it seems
[01:33:16] <MACscr> mikeumus: im close to the same boat, though i have a nice Galaxy SII. I just wish i had the 3 now =P
[01:34:05] <mikeumus> yeah, their for-profit corporations in bloody oceans of competition.
[01:34:12] <mikeumus> Tis the nature of the beast.
[01:34:51] <MACscr> yep. nothing wrong with it either
[01:35:49] <mikeumus> I have nothing against it as long as they understand the bigger picture and make semi-moral decissions.
[01:36:27] <mikeumus> I like my company philosophy right here, sums it up pretty well I think: http://massdistributionmedia.com/company/
[01:36:56] <MACscr> what happened to being 100% original? your site is based off a template =P
[01:37:00] <mikeumus> " their lifeâ€™s" may be inproper grammer though, lol
[01:37:25] <mikeumus> I know, it's more so for the graphics, but we are 7 months deep on making a super sick node.js cms
[01:37:34] <mikeumus> it'll be free and open source
[01:37:55] <mikeumus> it's owned by a client but we have rights to it, anyways...
[01:38:04] <mikeumus> more on that later
[01:47:48] <MACscr> Ok, so here would be my test code for my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/TS3UC/1/
[01:48:59] <MACscr> basically i need to figure out how to get that validation code to apply to that form. It doesnt work because the form is loaded after the js. I am pretty sure I should be using on() to do this, but im not 100% sure what it should be bound to
[01:49:16] <mikeumus> warpping it in jQ.ready() was no dice.
[01:49:29] <mikeumus> we're both stuck MACsrc
[01:49:32] <mikeumus> lol
[01:49:40] <haizum> im having an issue getting isotope modified masonry layout to work (gutters)
[01:49:43] <haizum> To use these mods, you’ll need to copy the revised $.Isotope.prototype methods than can be found in the page source.
[01:49:47] <haizum> not sure what he means here
[01:49:52] <haizum> http://metafizzy.co/blog/tests-modified-masonry-layouts/
[01:50:00] <MACscr> unfortunately most of the feeders have left and just us leechers are left =P
[01:51:03] <MACscr> haizum: where are you even loading jquery?
[01:51:12] <haizum> where?
[01:51:19] <haizum> what do you mean
[01:51:33] <haizum> my jquery is working fine
[01:51:56] <MACscr> well i dont see it in your source that your even loading it
[01:51:58] <asher^> MACscr, if i were you, id bind the submit button press to a function that prevents the default action, then has an if ($(form).valid()) { }
[01:52:14] <BinaryKitten> MACscr you're right
[01:52:18] <haizum> thats not my page
[01:52:30] <BinaryKitten> what's used to load the form in MACscr
[01:52:33] <haizum> thats a page i'm trying to follow to get the gutters function of isotope to work
[01:53:04] <MACscr> BinaryKitten: what action? aka, clicking on a button or link like i am doing in the example
[01:53:19] <BinaryKitten> anything.. how are you loading it?
[01:53:36] <BinaryKitten> $.load, $.ajax, on click of a link, triggered elsewise
[01:54:00] <MACscr> im using a jquery plugin called nyromodal  http://jsfiddle.net/TS3UC/1/
[01:54:09] <BinaryKitten> right
[01:54:28] <BinaryKitten> that fiddle doesn't show me that
[01:54:39] <systemfault> haizum: Seems pretty obvious to meâ€¦ take a look at the source of the page..
[01:54:50] <BinaryKitten> what does nyromodal do to load the form?
[01:54:50] <MACscr> BinaryKitten: its linked to in the Resources area
[01:54:57] <haizum> i haven't even posted my page yet!
[01:55:16] <BinaryKitten> MACscr it might be, but the fiddle has no code for it
[01:56:00] <MACscr> BinaryKitten: well it doesnt have any code for jquery either if you want to be that specific
[01:56:43] <BinaryKitten> MACscr so my original question still stands - how are you loading the form
[01:56:57] <MACscr> i have no idea how they loading it. I know its an XHR request. Thats all i know
[01:57:19] <MACscr> you have the same information i have
[01:57:36] <BinaryKitten> ok the issue you have is that if you don't know how they are loading it, you can't hook and load your validation up
[01:58:01] <BinaryKitten> you were right in the face that the loading is preventing the validation, since it's loaded afterwards
[01:58:38] <BinaryKitten> *s/right in the face/right in the fact
[01:59:46] <MACscr> its $.ajax
[01:59:59] <MACscr> chromes dev tools shows me that
[02:02:17] <MACscr> at least i think thats what its saying: http://www.screencast.com/t/Q24nW7M6J73c
[02:05:30] <BinaryKitten> MACscr right, but that's the method used ... since it's in an external lib, you'd be best consulting the devs of that lib on the q
[02:06:48] <MACscr> BinaryKitten: im confused, cant i just make some sort of secondary function that makes js aware of the form when i click on the button that opens the form in the first place?
[02:07:02] <BinaryKitten> don't know
[02:07:20] <BinaryKitten> since i dion't know when the lib hooks or handles the request
[02:07:28] <BinaryKitten> afterall you could hook the click
[02:07:49] <BinaryKitten> but i don't think the form is going to be have loaded at that point either
[02:09:29] <BinaryKitten> sorry MACscr i have to go now
[02:11:10] <MACscr> boo! Thanks for trying
[02:11:39] <MACscr> i think im just going to embed the js function after the form and call it a day
[02:14:24] <MACscr> yep. That worked. Dirty, but at least i can move on to other stuff.
[02:15:09] <mikeumus> praises!
[02:17:16] <MACscr> threw it outside the jquery.ready() and into a regular js function, then simply added <script>update_user();</script> after the form and bam. Done =P
[02:20:01] <LukeNukem> Hello
[02:38:06] <abletony84> at http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/ - how do i make the tag dropdown list like http://home.no/dwaynie/jsNmq.png ?
[03:12:50] <Whirl3d> abletony84, #css and a database backend for the numbers
[03:14:06] <KingDosser> Is it possible to resize an element that is being dragged?
[03:14:19] <Whirl3d> Nearly anything is possible.
[03:14:23] <Whirl3d> but yes
[03:14:31] <mikeumus> peace!
[03:14:42] <KingDosser> Cause when I try and use animate to resize it.. it changes the size of where it was
[03:15:24] <abletony84> Whirl3d: thanks
[03:16:05] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to animate? Which properties?
[03:16:19] <KingDosser> width, and left and right margin
[03:16:43] <Whirl3d> Although it may be possible, I kind of doubt that that's the best was to go about it.
[03:17:16] <Whirl3d> If you want to dynamically adjust the element's shape based on drag position, then handle the drag event and update the size accordingly
[03:17:54] <Whirl3d> If you want to animate an element that you are dragging, it would probably be best to wrap the animating element in a div that drags
[03:18:28] <KingDosser> Basically I want to make my element to change size to fit on something when it is dragged on it
[03:18:34] <KingDosser> change size(
[03:18:35] <KingDosser> *
[03:18:55] <Whirl3d> You'll have to post some example code to get a better answer
[03:19:48] <KingDosser> What about changing width?
[03:19:56] <KingDosser> Of the currently dragged item?
[03:21:00] <Whirl3d> Okay, when you read what I have replied, then I'll be more than happy to continue helping you. I gave you my opinion about the ways that I thought it would work, and offered to look through your code to determine exactly what you meant.
[03:23:29] <Whirl3d> I just read my last post and apologize that I sounded like such an ass. I am right in the middle of a project and yet I would like to help, so I am cutting to the chase. Just ignore my tone..
[03:24:17] <KingDosser> Sorry Whirl3d. I totally understand where you are coming from. I have seen people come in here demanding to be helped.
[03:24:35] <KingDosser> I just can't really share my design.
[03:24:45] <KingDosser> But I have made some progress anyway so it is fine :)
[03:24:49] <Whirl3d> The thing about your quesiton that I don't understand is this:
[03:25:12] <Whirl3d> you said I want to make my element change size to fine on something...
[03:25:25] <Whirl3d> so I guess the draggable is "my element"
[03:25:38] <Whirl3d> and you want to change it to fit on a target element
[03:26:07] <Whirl3d> but animating it's width doesn't sound like a good solution.
[03:26:07] <wunnle> Hey guys.
[03:26:21] <Whirl3d> whereas handling the drag event and adjusting the width accordingly does.
[03:26:38] <wunnle> Can I ask a ajax question here? What I'm wondering is jQuery part actually.
[03:26:49] <Whirl3d> If you have the element "snap" to its finaly desitination, then you could animate on mouseup after the drag event
[03:27:31] <Whirl3d> otherwise you could figure out the change in width from the beginning to the end and the draggable distance and have it size relative to the percentage of the dragged distance.
[03:27:48] <Whirl3d> wunnie, yes, but just ask.
[03:29:52] <wunnle> I have a mail list registration page and a PHP script to validate it. PHP prints different results like "you are already on list" and "thanks for signing up". I want to show them in HTML without reloading the page. I googled about it but the examples were too complicated. it's wunnle btw.
[03:30:53] <Whirl3d> wunnie, its actually really simple.
[03:31:16] <wunnle> Whirl3d, yay.
[03:31:53] <Whirl3d> you will need the url of the php script and an object that contains these properties: {dataType:"html", success:function () {}, error:function () {}}
[03:32:48] <Whirl3d> now is the success function you will write it like this:   var loadSuccess=function (data) { var destDiv=$("#myreply"); destDiv.html(data);}
[03:33:44] <Whirl3d> which basically says, if successfully submitted, the php script is going to return html text that I want to assign to my "reply" div...or whatever you want to call it.
[03:34:26] <Whirl3d> you can skipp the error function to get started, then you can buildin an action if the form errors out later
[03:34:56] <Whirl3d> now, your command is simple $.ajax(url, configObj);
[03:35:37] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(url, {dataType:"html", success:function (data) {$("#myDiv").html(data);}});
[03:35:57] <wunnle> Sounds really easy.
[03:35:58] <Whirl3d> or that line will do it all for you in one line
[03:36:22] <wunnle> Let me try it.
[03:36:23] <Whirl3d> just replace url with your url and #myDiv with your div
[03:39:13] <wunnle> Whirl3d, and how should i trigger the function?
[03:40:27] <Whirl3d> meaning what?
[03:41:02] <wunnle> When user presses submit button, how ajax code will be triggered?
[03:41:09] <Whirl3d> when they submit their registration form, capture the submit event, preent default, and then do the ajax
[03:42:15] <wunnle> Erm, and how i'm gonna do that?
[03:42:40] <wunnle> Sorry for being a dummy, i'm a designer, so not much into code.
[03:42:45] <Whirl3d> $("form").on("submit", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $.ajax(url, {dataType:"html", data:data to pass, success:function () {});
[03:43:32] <Whirl3d> now data to pass, is going to be achieved by serializing the form. Unfortunately, you are gonna hae to google that. Look for $.serializeForm() maybe?
[03:43:43] <Whirl3d> ? .serializeForm
[03:43:44] <bot-t1> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".serializeForm" in jQuery Docs.
[03:43:53] <pachet> ?.serialize()
[03:43:53] <bot-t1> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[03:43:54] <Whirl3d> ? .serialize
[03:43:54] <bot-t1> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[03:44:09] <Whirl3d> pachet to the rescue! That's it
[03:44:29] <wunnle> Haha, ok.
[03:46:15] <Whirl3d> Hey and good job for taking the steps to learn some code. Good designers understand what goes on behind the scenes, in my opinion, so I am always gladd to see designers being responsible and willing to learn.
[03:47:10] <wunnle> Thanks, appreciated!
[03:58:22] <Behi> Is there a cross-browser jQuery lib for listening to CSS3 animationEnd events?
[04:03:05] <Tomashe> hey guys need some help:
[04:03:11] <Tomashe> $(".ALSEL").change(function()    {	alert($(this).hasClass("ALSELF"));
[04:03:33] <Tomashe> why this isnt working when i select a option that has class its always say false :/
[04:07:09] <pachet> Tomashe: that would check whether the <select> (i'm assuming that's what .ALSEL is) has that class, not an <option> child of that select
[04:07:21] <pachet> that said, 'ALSEL' !== 'ALSELF'
[04:33:51] <DarkSector> Hello, what do I use to manipulate URLs and then trigger it?
[04:35:32] <pachet> can you elaborate on what you mean?
[04:35:46] <pachet> window.location.href = "foo.php"
[04:36:25] <DarkSector> I want to change foo.com/abc foo.com/abc/search/bar
[04:36:31] <DarkSector> to
[04:37:56] <pachet> without a redirect?
[04:38:18] <DarkSector> I mean the next page that should be loaded should be foo.com/abc/search/bar
[04:38:28] <DarkSector> pachet: ^
[04:38:43] <DarkSector> The thing is my Application takes the URL paramaters and searches
[04:39:00] <DarkSector> so if I can manipulate the URL I can make the search part easily
[04:45:54] <pachet> DarkSector: window.location.href += '/search/bar'; ?
[04:48:27] <wavez> I have a jqGrid object and for the afterCellSaved event, I'm am using $.post() to do some ajax stuff with the DB, handle the user input, validate it, update records, etc.
[04:48:44] <wavez> I'm trying to figure out how to do something useful with the callback function I'm passing to $.post()
[04:49:04] <DarkSector> pachet: thanks, I'll try that out
[04:49:05] <wavez> I need it to call methods on my jqGrid object, to change cell values.
[04:49:37] <wavez> But I can't figure out how to pass the jqGrid object to the $.post() callback function.
[04:51:14] <pachet> wavez: you can likely use closures to your advantage
[04:51:33] <pachet> if you can paste your code somewhere i can be of more help
[04:51:50] <zChris> $("div[name=y"+countY) this should work as a selector right ?
[04:51:57] <wavez> pachet, okay, I'll paste it for you.
[04:52:52] <wavez> pachet, pastebin.com okay?
[04:52:58] <pachet> wavez: that's fine
[04:53:20] <pachet> zChris : $("div[name=y"+countY+"]");
[04:53:34] <pachet> closing brace
[04:53:47] <zChris> pachet, ah thanks :)
[04:54:59] <wavez> pachet, http://pastebin.com/ff7B9rVa
[04:55:14] <wavez> pachet, lines 80 and 89 are the events for the jqGrid object
[04:55:23] <wavez> pachet, first line is the callback function
[04:56:30] <wavez> pachet, for testing, I have been replacing $.post() with $.get()
[05:01:49] <Whirl3d> Behi, can you be more specific?
[05:03:48] <wavez> pachet, actually, I just found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5097191/ajax-context-option/5097214#5097214
[05:04:08] <wavez> pachet, so maybe $(this) will work in my callback
[05:07:15] <alexidoia> I'd like to target a label thanks to the value of its for attribute, I am using attr() but I don't know how to make it into a loop so I can check its value
[05:08:30] <pachet> wavez: sorry for the delay, got distracted by the cats
[05:08:42] <pachet> wavez: take a look at https://gist.github.com/3116469
[05:08:44] <wavez> pachet, lol. They do that
[05:11:25] <pachet> alexidoia: you can just use an attribute selector, eg $('label[for="foo"]')
[05:11:39] <alexidoia> pachet : thanks
[05:13:02] <dispy> Hi, it's me again
[05:13:37] <dispy> $(selector).each(function(){ I need a variable from the outer scope in here. How todo that?
[05:14:13] <pachet> variables in the outer scope will be bound in the inner scope as well
[05:14:25] <Behi> Whirl3d: rather than listeing to "webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd â€¦"  I want to just listen to "animationEnd" and the library can then convert that to the browser's version of the event name
[05:14:30] <pachet> the glory of lexical environments at work
[05:14:47] <dispy> @patchet: if I log it outside and inside, it's undefined inside and outside works without problems
[05:15:42] <zChris> If add a <div name="y0"></div> with $('temp').append(div); i should be able to access it directly after with $('div[name=y0]') right? I do not need to reread the dom structure or anything ?
[05:15:57] <wavez> pachet, cool trick. Thanks much :)
[05:16:18] <dispy> @zChris: you don't need to do, but you need to add temp to the dom, if it hasn't been added yet
[05:17:07] <zChris> dispy, yes that one is added, the structure adds to the document just find, it is just that when i try to search for the div i added it returns nothing
[05:17:39] <dispy> I guess because name is not a valid attribute
[05:17:45] <dispy> what about data-name?
[05:18:00] <dispy> then you can search like div[data-name="y0"] ?
[05:18:15] <pachet> dispy: i guess show me a paste? otherwise see http://jsfiddle.net/vFmzF/
[05:18:18] <zChris> dispy, alright, data-name is a valid one then i guess?
[05:18:35] <dispy> yes. it's HTML5-data-attribute
[05:19:20] <zChris> dispy, no that didnt work either, i can direct you to my site if you want to take a look? It is not very complicated, it is just that im a novice :)
[05:19:34] <dispy> @pachet: possibly because it's a parameter in my case?
[05:19:42] <pachet> zChris, dispy: name should work just fine as an attribute selector
[05:19:48] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/vFmzF/1/
[05:20:03] <dispy> should, but does not necessarily, as it's not granted by the standard
[05:20:13] <dispy> yeah zChris, just post the link
[05:21:02] <pachet> dispy: can you paste an example of the issue you're having?
[05:22:55] <zChris> http://cae.mooo.com/Labyrint/ there is the link. Look at the javascript code at the bottom start['y'] = alert(), ive done a alert there to see what that specific search function returns. I know start['y'] will be undefined :)
[05:22:58] <dispy> i'm having problems to get the problem on jsfiddle ;D
[05:23:19] <dispy> http://pastebin.com/FCVvQ6xk << see here
[05:24:02] <dispy> the hole thing is ok in the first log, but inthe second it's undefined. the hole structure is part of a "class" -definitino
[05:24:38] <zChris> dispy, whole not hole :) hole means a hole in the ground :) Not trying to be an ass or anthing :P
[05:24:54] <dispy> ;D
[05:25:14] <dispy> two times in one sentence. omfg ;D
[05:25:16] <Tomashe> pachet: how can i refer to the actual "option"
[05:26:12] <pachet> Tomashe: which option? the one that's selected?
[05:26:18] <dispy> any idea pachet?
[05:26:20] <pachet> dispy: hm, that should work
[05:26:32] <Tomashe> yes
[05:26:33] <pachet> dispy: that said you dont really need to redeclare those arguments as variables
[05:26:53] <pachet> from the interpreter's perspective they are essentially the same
[05:26:58] <dispy> is there any direction in which I can search? I'm not really a js-programmer so I'm just trying to finish it :)
[05:27:04] <pachet> ie, identifiers within that function's environment record
[05:27:25] <pachet> dispy: i guess try and replicate the issue on jsfiddle :[
[05:27:40] <dispy> how I hate it ;D
[05:27:42] <pachet> i made a simple test case, and its working fine for me, so
[05:27:57] <Tomashe> pachet: yes
[05:28:43] <dispy> yeah. and my script is ~500 lines long. simple test case ;D
[05:28:47] <dispy> let's break that down ;D
[05:28:59] <zChris> Did anyone see what the problem might be? :)
[05:30:13] <DarkSector> pachet: http://pastie.org/4260394
[05:30:21] <DarkSector> pachet: doesn't seem to work
[05:30:53] <Tomashe> actualy u were wrong cuz when i put $(this).val() it alert me the option value
[05:31:03] <DarkSector> #updatestate is a <a> tag and #selectstate is the <select> option
[05:31:06] <Tomashe> so $(this). does refer to the option inside the select
[05:31:13] <pachet> Tomashe: wrong
[05:31:26] <Tomashe> so why it shows me the "value"
[05:31:26] <pachet> Tomashe: jquery just does you the favor of resolving .val() on a select to the value of the selected option
[05:31:29] <pachet> ^
[05:31:33] <Tomashe> i c
[05:31:44] <Tomashe> so how can i check the class of a selected option?
[05:32:12] <pachet> $(this).children(':selected').attr('class')
[05:32:22] <Tomashe> ok let me try that
[05:33:00] <Tomashe> working like a charm!
[05:33:02] <Tomashe> thanks mate
[05:33:08] <Tomashe> u were correct after all :)
[05:33:14] <pachet> Tomashe: yw :D
[05:33:23] <pachet> DarkSector: yours is actually the same problem as Tomashe's
[05:33:29] <DarkSector> oh?
[05:33:35] <DarkSector> how so?
[05:33:36] <pachet> use $('#selecstate').val() and see if that helps
[05:33:40] <DarkSector> okay
[05:33:44] <pachet> er * selectstate rather
[05:33:58] <vivekm> I have a doubt related to indexed DB. Is this the right place to ask question related to it?
[05:34:19] <DarkSector> pachet: No the thing is, it works, I used alert("value is " + newlocation) and it gives me the proper url
[05:34:37] <DarkSector> pachet: it's the request that fails. In firebug I get an error for GET request
[05:35:39] <pachet> oh, hrm
[05:35:40] <pachet> what's the error?
[05:35:42] <DarkSector> it doesn't redirect the page, I want to go the url.
[05:35:52] <GreekFreak> hi all
[05:35:57] <pachet> hi
[05:36:09] <DarkSector> pachet: status: Aborted for the GET request
[05:36:57] <GreekFreak> I have a click event function for a collection of buttons that is initialised on document.ready. I subsequently add new buttons that I want to use the same click even, and I don't know how to bind them (forgive the pun) to the already initialised click event. Any advice?
[05:38:05] <pachet> GreekFreak: does your click callback function have a name? or is it assigned anonymously
[05:38:56] <GreekFreak> pachet, at the moment it's called $(".my-btn").click(function())
[05:39:07] <pachet> GreekFreak: there's the problem
[05:39:13] <pachet> try something like this instead:
[05:39:22] <DarkSector> pachet: okay the problem was with my application but the thing is this is the response when the GET request gets through "Reload the page to get source for: http://localhost:7000/professionals/state/Alabama"
[05:39:34] <DarkSector> It doesn't go the link
[05:39:41] <pachet> function foo ( ) { /* do something when clicked */ }; $('.foo').on('click', foo);
[05:39:58] <pachet> GreekFreak: then later you can just bind the foo function to other elements, just as easily
[05:41:40] <pachet> DarkSector: hrm, that sounds like a firebug problem
[05:42:01] <DarkSector> Well the page doesn't load pachet
[05:42:15] <DarkSector> Oh no I had to do return false;
[05:42:17] <DarkSector> tested with that
[05:42:18] <DarkSector> it works.
[05:42:26] <DarkSector> thanks for your time pachet
[05:43:22] <pachet> ah, gotcha. no sweat :]
[05:46:02] <GreekFreak> pachet, thank you. I saw the on function but I tried to "on()" it on the click event. This makes sense. I'll try it now
[05:57:51] <xenaxon> hi
[05:58:02] <xenaxon> how can I do an action each time the browser window is resized
[06:01:02] <pachet> ?.resize() @ xenanon
[06:01:02] <bot-t1> xenanon, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[06:20:03] <Misiur> I'm back to help. Anybody has any problems?
[06:24:08] <xenaxon> how can I insert a simple google map
[06:24:12] <xenaxon> for my business
[06:24:40] <xenaxon> just need to show our location
[06:24:50] <asher^> that has nothing to do with jquery
[06:24:55] <asher^> just click the link on the maps page
[06:27:00] <GreekFreak> pachet, I tried what you suggested in the success of an ajax call, and what it did was call the click event. I just wanted a bind. I used this  '            $(".delete-btn.address-btn").on("click", deleteAddress()) '
[06:27:37] <pachet> GreekFreak: no, that's actually calling the function
[06:27:44] <pachet> just do .on('click', deleteAddress)
[06:28:51] <GreekFreak> pachet, oh! no brackets lol thanx
[06:29:28] <GreekFreak> pachet, worked like a charm ;)
[06:30:06] <MimiEA> xenaxon : http://bit.ly/NqwFqf
[06:30:55] <zChris> Hello, i have a problem that i cant search for a <div> that has been appended. Here is the url http://cae.mooo.com/labyrint/ the problem resides in the bottom of the javascript code
[06:32:31] <pachet> zChris: your selector specifies the data-name attribute
[06:32:38] <pachet> but your element only has a name attribute
[06:32:39] <pachet> no bueno
[06:33:56] <zChris> pachet, ah yes, that was from my last try to changing to HTML5 valid code as suggested here. But it still dosent work with name
[06:34:11] <zChris> I've changed it now
[06:36:05] <zChris> im totally clueless :S All i can think of that it dosent update the dom or something similiar
[06:44:52] <zChris> If anyone want to know why it didnt work it was becouse that getJson was asyncronous called and that it wasent completed before my search
[06:48:53] <GreekFreak> I'm changing the src of an image using ajax, and it won't update the image. I even added a /myfile.png?some_date  to the src but nothing
[06:51:37] <zChris> Isit possible to have two searchcriteria, like this $('div[name=pelle,value=3]) ?
[07:05:49] <wunnle> Hey there again.
[07:06:24] <MichMich> Hi There
[07:06:42] <Whirl3d> hey folks
[07:06:47] <MichMich> Hey
[07:07:51] <wunnle> I've just write my first ajax code. Huzzah. It takes mail adress from a form and sends to php to check if it's already on the list and prints the result. But interestingly, it is not working well as expected.
[07:08:02] <wunnle> http://wunnle.com/ajaxTest/
[07:08:19] <wunnle> here is mail list -> http://wunnle.com/ajaxTest/mails.txt
[07:08:24] <wunnle> And php is incoming.
[07:09:17] <wunnle> Php -> http://pastebin.com/K2YETxfA
[07:10:00] <wunnle> Is it sending data differently? I always get invalid error.
[07:10:20] <MichMich> Let me check
[07:12:02] <MichMich> First off all... why a plain text DB? en not MySQL?
[07:13:01] <MichMich> Anyhow... besides that
[07:13:14] <MichMich> in your jquery ajax post, you are using GET
[07:13:24] <MichMich> in your php you are using POST
[07:14:02] <MichMich> changle line 11 of your php to: $email = $_REQUEST['email_address'];
[07:15:07] <wunnle> Changed.
[07:15:14] <wunnle> Still get invalid mail error.
[07:15:43] <MichMich> change your php to echo back the input to see if it recieves the emailadress
[07:16:27] <MichMich> for example after line 11:
[07:16:34] <MichMich> die($email);
[07:16:54] <MichMich> it will echo the mailadress and stop the php
[07:17:21] <wunnle> Hmm, added, but nothing happened.
[07:17:39] <MichMich> so we can conclude: php doesnt recieve anything
[07:18:06] <MichMich> ah, think i found it
[07:18:57] <wunnle> What is it?
[07:19:04] <MichMich> the way you post data
[07:19:19] <MichMich> you dont specify any fieldname
[07:19:25] <MichMich> just sending raw data
[07:19:44] <wunnle> Hmm, how should i do it?
[07:19:48] <MichMich> one sec
[07:19:57] <MichMich> I'll make it more easy for u
[07:22:41] <MichMich> http://paste.laravel.com/2kw
[07:22:59] <MichMich> That should work
[07:23:07] <wunnle> Hmm, let me try
[07:23:45] <dispy> does jquery evaluate certian things before they're actualyl needed?
[07:24:05] <dispy> I'm building a callback  (ajax-request) and it has a url of the form baseUrl + obj.getParams(
[07:24:08] <MichMich> $.post is a shorthand function of $.ajax(tyyp:'post' ....
[07:24:23] <dispy> ) this method however seems to be called _before_ the request ist started at all
[07:24:23] <MichMich> so less code, less mistakes wunnle :)
[07:24:53] <wunnle> Voila! It's dead! :P
[07:24:57] <wunnle> Let me remove it too
[07:25:11] <MichMich> does it work wunnle?
[07:25:27] <MichMich> dispy: should not happen. Maybe an error in your code?
[07:25:40] <wunnle> Yep!
[07:25:46] <wunnle> Thanks a lot mich.
[07:25:56] <dispy> I don't think so: http://pastebin.com/SYrrsgFK
[07:26:16] <dispy> the test shows up on a time the autocomplete is initialized
[07:26:21] <wunnle> MichMich, why didn't I used serialize here and when should I use?
[07:26:51] <dispy> I guess that's ok in this case
[07:26:57] <MichMich> Serialize is an easy way to send a full form. in this case you're only sending 1 field. So no need to.
[07:26:58] <dispy> but it's actually not what I expected it to do. ;D
[07:27:05] <pachet> dispy: its not jquery that's evaluating it, it's just javascript
[07:27:07] <MichMich> dispy: let me chck
[07:27:14] <dispy> yeah I realized ^
[07:27:33] <pachet> you're declaring an object literal, and assigning the 'source' property to an expression that js has to concatenate
[07:28:01] <wunnle> MichMich, thanks again!
[07:28:04] <pachet> perhaps s/concatenate/evaluate
[07:28:41] <MichMich> wunnle: think about making the email list a database (mysql).
[07:28:53] <MichMich> Working on raw files is not the best approach.
[07:31:19] <dispy> yes pachet. I know that all. I'm just programming for too long today ;D
[07:31:34] <Drager> With this code how can I change the value on the link with the value Show to Hide when its shown?
[07:31:37] <Drager> http://jsfiddle.net/CWu7b/

[07:37:54] <pachet> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/2AWhS/
[07:39:03] <wunnle> MichMich, I have another problem. I have integrated the code on this page, but there is problem with some Turkish characters. How can i solve it? http://kutukev.org/ (it's on the sidebar, mail listesi)
[07:39:46] <MichMich> problem with which characeter?
[07:40:07] <MichMich> Ah, you mean in the result: Mail adresiniz geï¿½ersiz.
[07:40:14] <wunnle> Yep.
[07:40:26] <wunnle> It should be like Mail adresiniz geçersiz
[07:40:53] <MichMich> Put this in the head of your html document:
[07:40:53] <MichMich> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
[07:41:22] <MichMich> or shorter:
[07:41:24] <MichMich> <meta charset="utf-8">
[07:41:54] <MichMich> Or encode the result from php
[07:42:41] <MichMich> echo htmlentities("htmlentities");
[07:43:39] <wunnle> My html charset is already utf-8.
[07:43:42] <Drager> Thank you pachet !
[07:44:24] <MichMich> wunnle: than go for the (better) solution: encode your data. The proper way :)
[07:44:30] <MichMich> http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlentities.php
[07:44:37] <wunnle> Already on it! (:
[07:52:53] <dogmatic69> hi all. Is there a better way to do the following? $this.parent().parent().parent().parent().remove();
[07:53:10] <wunnle> MichMich, could I trigger the function when user presses enter on field too? (a real jquery question at last)
[07:54:10] <wunnle> htmlentities solved my problem except ÄŸ character btw, thanks.
[07:54:18] <dogmatic69> wunnle: enter on a normal input will trigger form submit, or you can check key strokes
[07:55:06] <MichMich> $("#target").keypress(function(event) {
[07:55:16] <MichMich>   if ( event.which == 13 ) {
[07:55:21] <MichMich> (13 = enter)
[08:00:50] <wunnle> MichMich, you are my new hero.

[08:27:37] <dash_> is there any way to convert inline styles to document wide styles and print it for example to textarea?
[08:28:52] <fireman_biff> Hi, is there a way to use jquery to scroll a div by dragging the mouse, similar to to how most PDF programs let you drag to scroll? I'm looking for something that functions the same way as using the scroll wheel on a mouse. I've tried jQuery UI's draggable but I can't get it to do what I want and I'm starting to think thats the wrong approach.
[08:36:13] <GreekFreak> I'm trying to user autocomplete with a server resource, and although the server responds with a valid json, I don't get the results select box. Is it supposed to be returned in the format that is shown in the demo?
[08:40:31] <dabear_> geeeek: yep, like so: [ { "id": "Numenius tenuirostris", "label": "Slender-billed Curlew", "value": "Slender-billed Curlew" } ]
[08:51:16] <diverdude> if i do $(function(){var a=23}); i cannot do reference a in the console. Is that because a is local to the jquery function?
[08:55:00] <osada> @diverdude thats because it can only be referenced inside the function itself
[08:55:10] <osada> all var's in js are function scope
[08:56:01] <diverdude> ah ok
[08:56:02] <diverdude> thx
[09:00:55] <batdorf> When I load the page for the first time, the height starts out 1800px then shrinks to 180px. But if I refresh the page, it goes straight to 180px (this is what I want to happen when the page is first loaded). Is there something that is different when the page first loads opposed to a refresh?
[09:01:16] <batdorf> I know I made it a little vague. I can provide an example on github if you want
[09:01:37] <phonebook_> has something happened to ##javascript? it wont let me join
[09:03:38] <ph88> Why do i have to use $() (first line) and not (second line). this.height = $(selector).height(); this.x = event.pageX - selector.offsetLeft;
[09:04:07] <Onions> Because one is using jquery functions, on is not
[09:04:10] <Onions> one*
[09:04:28] <Onions> Fine for me phonebook_
[09:05:32] <phonebook_> k, it wouldn't be the first time i was booted for no good reason so im a little paranoid. but im 99% certain i didn't say or do anything that even the trolliest of trolls would construe as being a justified reason to boot
[09:06:14] <batdorf> Also, my issue doesnt always happen
[09:06:19] <abletony84> At http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/ - I'm trying to clone Stack Exchange's tag system (http://home.no/dwaynie/jsNmq.png), but how do I get one of those "x amount-of-tags"?
[09:09:17] <nebmo> hi, I can't seem to debug this. What is the reason for when you click on a cell it highlights on http://jsfiddle.net/rvreQ/6/ but when I put it on my server (http://www.temp.theadw.com/office/calendar/manage/closure.php) it doesn't highlight?
[09:09:48] <dabear_> abletony84: try actually using a non minified version of the select plugin, so we can study its source better
[09:09:49] <nebmo> (im using Firefox on a mac)
[09:09:51] <phonebook_> $.each($(".taggable").find(".select2-search-choice"), function() {$(this).css("border", 50px solid Red"});
[09:09:53] <phonebook_> ?
[09:09:56] <phonebook_> maybe something like that?
[09:13:11] <abletony84> dabear_: great idea
[09:14:41] <abletony84> dabear_: all done - http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/
[09:14:57] <abletony84> sorry http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/javascripts/select2.js
[09:16:09] <dabear_> abletony84: you gotta edit the function "addSelectedChoice"
[09:16:45] <ph88> how to capture the mouseup event ?
[09:17:26] <dabear_> abletony84: pseudo code: if (this tag I am trying to add already exist){ get that tag and modify its text to say " x 2" or " x 3"}
[09:19:53] <abletony84> dabear_: cool thanks!
[09:19:56] <abletony84> im gonna try that
[09:20:16] <phonebook_> $(selector).on("mouseup", function() { } );
[09:26:32] <batdorf> If anyone is paying attention, my issue seems to only happen in Chrome. And not all the time.
[09:29:29] <cusco> batdorf: its probably cache
[09:29:49] <cusco> page is probably 1800px, and something tells the browser to resize to 180px?
[09:29:52] <cusco> such as css, or js
[09:29:57] <nebmo> when you click on a cell it highlights on http://jsfiddle.net/rvreQ/6/ but when I put it on my server (http://www.temp.theadw.com/office/calendar/manage/closure.php) it doesn't highlight. how can i fix this?
[09:30:17] <cusco> then the browser caches that, and next time it will resize imediatly instead of wating for css/js
[09:30:26] <cusco> try ctrl + f5 while refreshing
[09:30:28] <batdorf> js adjusts the css (its a slider)
[09:31:41] <batdorf> the content is 1800px but adjusts to meet the height of the first slide
[09:32:34] <cusco> well, make the js adjust that elements size too before css, browser may load css after js
[09:35:38] <batdorf> Yeah, or maybe i can have it adjust without slide animations based on a specific condition
[09:40:32] <cablegunmaster> hello =)
[09:44:19] <cablegunmaster> allot of people but no talk in here :o?
[09:44:39] <jedimind> maybe ask a question
[09:44:43] <jedimind> and then people will engage
[09:45:06] <batdorf> thanks cusco
[09:45:52] <cablegunmaster> Well okay I was working with ajaxForm included in the jquery.form.js library and im wondering about XHR .
[09:46:59] <cablegunmaster> Cause... I'm making a application which first uploads files (works) and after that another submit button would submit the form. but it  gets stuck in the same  Div as the result of the uploads.
[09:47:32] <cusco> batdorf: did it work?
[09:48:04] <batdorf> I think it's going to take a bit more testing to figure it out.
[09:48:10] <cusco> ok..
[09:48:22] <cusco> use ctrl+f5 to make it not hit cached contents
[09:49:11] <batdorf> you can see it here if you want: https://github.com/KevinBatdorf/codaslider/tree/experimental
[09:50:08] <ph88> phonebook_: i would liuke to capture mouseup event not on a particular select but anywhere in the browser window
[09:55:06] <batdorf> cusco: I can't reproduce the problem with ctrl f5
[09:55:14] <cusco> hmm
[09:55:16] <batdorf> only when I close the page and open it again
[09:55:25] <cusco> :/
[09:55:32] <cusco> well at least you can reproduce it!
[09:55:51] <batdorf> and if I open another instance when the original is still open, the problem isn't there
[09:55:52] <batdorf> ha ha
[09:56:09] <batdorf> ah, i take that last statement back
[09:56:17] <RohanBhangui> is there anyway i can style the scrollbar of browser using jquery but iwhtout using a plugin
[09:56:24] <batdorf> i tried it again and it started at 1800px
[09:56:26] <RohanBhangui> is there some sort of element i can call
[09:58:09] <RohanBhangui> anyone there?
[09:58:24] <phonebook_> call for what?
[09:58:43] <batdorf> im here but have no answer. try downloading and reading through a plugin to see how they did it
[09:58:45] <phonebook_> ah the scrollbar
[09:58:53] <RohanBhangui> yes
[09:59:04] <phonebook_> i didnt know you could do that with a plugin
[09:59:11] <RohanBhangui> like if i can call an element (such as scrollbar) that might nwork
[09:59:23] <phonebook_> but what about making the page height and width 100% and then adding overflow:scroll, and then use your own scroll bar
[09:59:28] <phonebook_> that would give the same effect
[09:59:35] <RohanBhangui> yes you can do with webkits (Which is what  idid) but it doesnt work on non webkit browsers
[09:59:46] <phonebook_> 95%?
[09:59:48] <RohanBhangui> true
[09:59:58] <RohanBhangui> but i think there is an easier
[09:59:59] <RohanBhangui> way
[10:00:09] <RohanBhangui> damn you ie and firefox....such control freaks
[10:00:10] <ajws7036> hello! is this working? i am new here.
[10:00:14] <RohanBhangui> yes
[10:00:32] <RohanBhangui> ajws it is working
[10:00:40] <ajws7036> i have a question.. is anyone listening to me? again totally new to chat rooms XD
[10:00:41] <phonebook_> it was recently voted by a panel of experts that ff is the worst browser
[10:00:57] <phonebook_> yes we are listening
[10:01:18] <RohanBhangui> whats the issue
[10:01:22] <batdorf> im not listening, but im reading... go ahead
[10:01:26] <RohanBhangui> we are all listening all 900+ of us
[10:01:41] <ajws7036> okay. i have a question about using jquery (obviously)
[10:01:57] <phonebook_> i have a futuristic implant in my brain so i am actually listening
[10:01:58] <RohanBhangui> dude jsut state the question
[10:02:00] <RohanBhangui> no preambles
[10:02:50] <RohanBhangui> phonebook_:i still think there is a way to call but not sure
[10:02:53] <phonebook_> ah
[10:02:56] <phonebook_> rohan
[10:03:05] <phonebook_> have you tried putting overflow:hidden on the body element?
[10:03:07] <phonebook_> that might work
[10:03:12] <RohanBhangui> true that could work
[10:03:21] <RohanBhangui> acutally hwen you use webkits thats what you have to do
[10:03:25] <ajws7036> i am using a barcode writer from barcode-coder.com.  i need to write a barcode from an input box. the original code is
[10:03:25] <ajws7036> $("bcTarget").barcode("1234567890", code39)
[10:03:25] <ajws7036> how would i edit this so that 1234567890 can be replaced with my html text box input element?
[10:03:40] <phonebook_> #$@
[10:03:43] <phonebook_> #
[10:04:08] <RohanBhangui> i rather not do simulation
[10:04:11] <cablegunmaster> Question : I have a ajax call  made with ajaxForm how can I delete the Ajax call after its done (cleaning up the Call ). So it doessnt interrupt anything else?
[10:04:12] <RohanBhangui> webkits are so easy to use
[10:04:16] <RohanBhangui> i hate firfox
[10:04:27] <RohanBhangui> firefox used to be so loved now they are crap
[10:04:45] <ajws7036> i'm thinking of something like this.
[10:04:45] <ajws7036> $("#bcTarget").barcode("#input", code39) would that work?
[10:05:03] <RohanBhangui> i think safari and chrome are the only ones that support webkits
[10:05:08] <RohanBhangui> stfu noobs firefox and ie
[10:05:15] <ph88> how can i write:  if (not set variable) {}  ?
[10:05:53] <phonebook_> what is .barcode?
[10:05:59] <phonebook_> that must be a plugin?
[10:06:37] <RohanBhangui> ?.replaceWith()  @ ajws7036
[10:06:39] <bot-t1> ajws7036, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[10:06:53] <RohanBhangui> new bot?
[10:07:13] <ph88> yo how to check if a var is not set ?
[10:07:35] <RohanBhangui> it will show up in console as undefined
[10:07:37] <batdorf> ajws7036: try <input type="button" onclick='$("#bcTarget").barcode($('textbox').val(), "ean13",{barWidth:2, barHeight:30});' value="Test">
[10:07:37] <phonebook_> if(typeof x === "undefined")
[10:07:54] <ph88> thx
[10:07:55] <batdorf> like they have listed on the API (at the bottom)
[10:08:01] <ajws7036> Okay, thanks!
[10:08:03] <phonebook_> if(typeof x == "undefined") works also
[10:08:59] <RohanBhangui> phonebook_: so once i set overflow hidden
[10:09:00] <ph88> thxthx
[10:09:05] <RohanBhangui> what cna i do about showing the scrollbar
[10:09:31] <phonebook_> it would be in your div
[10:09:41] <phonebook_> let me test locally...
[10:11:57] <ajws7036> another question.
[10:12:51] <ajws7036> I use phonegap and jquery mobile to develop android apps..... when I press the menu button on my android device, how would i display a jquery mobile dialog?
[10:14:57] <RohanBhangui> phoinebook_: will wait cause i was making good progress on webkits unitl cross browser compatibility came into paly
[10:17:23] <phonebook_> god ie is a piece of crap
[10:20:30] <phonebook_> this works in ie but you cant declare the height in % http://pastebin.com/DzhMwzeD
[10:20:56] <phonebook_> but then not sure how you would scroll the scrollbar on the div
[10:21:21] <phonebook_> *style the scrollerbar on the div
[10:24:20] <cablegunmaster> anyone a ajax expert =)?
[10:25:33] <bwq> lol
[10:26:28] <ph88> why does alert($(this.box).css("text-align")); work and alert($(this.box).css("transform")); does not work ? css: text-align: center; transform: scale(1,1);
[10:26:33] <phonebook_> got it
[10:26:35] <phonebook_> #@$#@#@ ie
[10:26:36] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:26:40] <RohanBhangui> send link
[10:26:45] <phonebook_> give me a sec to clean up
[10:26:49] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:26:52] <RohanBhangui> can you fiddle it?\
[10:27:17] <phonebook_> sure
[10:27:20] <RohanBhangui> k
[10:29:00] <phonebook_> http://jsfiddle.net/kNvtr/
[10:31:15] <phonebook_> $( "#dialog" ).dialog(); http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[10:35:05] <wavez> I have a page with some jqGrid objects. When the gridComplete event fires, I want to add some variables that I want to be persistent to that object. Would that be written like this? $(this).myNewVar = 0;
[10:52:35] * imsky akfakfjafkansf
[11:03:37] <shoky> word
[11:18:37] <Annoyed> hey :)
[11:22:02] <Annoyed> is a table an object?
[11:22:14] <Annoyed> may I add attributes to it?
[11:22:26] <cablegunmaster_> First I upload files using php using the jquery.form.js after that it sends a respond saying failed or uploaded...   ->   status.html(xhr.responseText);    after that I want to continue on a new submit but it loads in status.html again.
[11:25:49] <shoky> Annoyed: a table is an html element
[11:26:16] <shoky> Annoyed: you can select it with jquery and add attributes to it, sure
[11:27:05] <Annoyed> shoky and this attributes are used for search and filtering, right?
[11:27:17] <shoky> what?
[11:27:26] <shoky> they are used for different things..
[11:27:45] <Annoyed> I need a method to sort and filter ..
[11:28:01] <Annoyed> So I thought I would add attributes and check for their values to control if they match the filter
[11:28:07] <shoky> you can select elements based on their attributes, if that's what you mean
[11:28:16] <Annoyed> okay :)
[11:28:16] <shoky> but that isn't a great way to do it
[11:28:17] <Annoyed> thx
[11:28:23] <Annoyed> which way would you prefer?
[11:28:27] <shoky> best use ids and classes
[11:28:51] <shoky> best not search the DOM but search your JS objects
[11:29:08] <Annoyed> oh, all this is way to complicated ._.
[11:29:42] <shoky> just use attributes ;p
[11:29:59] <shoky> if you have performance issues you'll know one possible reason for it
[11:31:15] <Annoyed> okay .. but performance and user experience are the main goals =(
[11:31:48] <Annoyed> may I pm you shoky?
[11:31:49] <shoky> if i knew more about what you're trying to do i could give more concrete adivce
[11:31:52] <shoky> ya
[11:49:02] <exxy-> The .keydown event appears to trigger constantly as a user holds the keydown.  Is there a function that will trigger once when the key is down?  I cannot use .keypress because I need to know when they pressed it down and when they let it go (I am using keyup for that.)
[11:56:29] <gnech_>  Just now I learned about jquerytools. Anyone have an opinion on jquerytools vs jqueryUI?
[12:00:07] <jasecoop> Hi there, I was wondering if anyone might be able to help and recommend the best way to organise my jquery so it runs on specific pages only...
[12:00:57] <cablegunmaster_> well if you dont call functions ... your jquery wont be called or used.
[12:01:33] <shoky> ^^
[12:02:04] <jasecoop> so just a matter of only calling particular functions dependent on the page?
[12:02:28] <shoky> or only including particular scripts
[12:02:34] <jasecoop> just wondering what's common practise...
[12:03:24] <jasecoop> are individual scripts more effective than one global script?
[12:03:35] <shoky> effective?
[12:03:43] <shoky> they are easier to debug and maintain
[12:04:35] <shoky> if you want you can also use smth like require.js which takes care of loading dependencies for you
[12:05:05] <jasecoop> ah that looks handy, cheers
[12:05:45] <Whirl3d> shoky! wassup?
[12:05:57] <shoky> whirly! am okz. sup?
[12:10:03] <gtuckerkellogg> I'm iterating through a JSON object using $.each() and replacing a particular <span> element.  I'd like to pause at each iteration for an animation effect.  Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?
[12:15:05] <gnech_> Anyone have an opinion on jquerytools vs jqueryUI?
[12:17:07] <marrow> how do i change this each-loop in this RSS parser http://jsfiddle.net/kTDMS/ to a for-loop? I'm quite the newb. I've made an attempt (  http://jsfiddle.net/ue2fD/1/ ) but an error occurs, seems like I don't index the data.value.items array properly
[12:21:48] <io__> how can i join 2 integers variables?
[12:22:22] <io__> like intvar1 and intvar2 if they are 3 and 5 then the result is 35 or 3-5 or 3_5
[12:23:45] <LoneStar99> when using jquery do you all recommend including JQ file on my server or have it fetch from JQ server?
[12:25:11] <LoneStar99> if always fetching from JQ server it is possible that the latest could break m code, if certain events have been depreciated right?
[12:25:23] <dabear_> io__: "" + 2 + 2
[12:29:07] <shoky> gtuckerkellogg: don't use $.each if you want to pause in the middle
[12:29:43] <shoky> gtuckerkellogg: you can use the animation complete callback to start the next "iteration"
[12:31:36] <shoky> LoneStar99: yeah.. if you're fetching it from a CDN in production, then make sure you're fetching a specific version and not the latest
[12:32:27] <LoneStar99> ok need to change url from a specific version
[12:32:28] <shoky> LoneStar99: and it'll prolly be quicker if you fetch it from a cdn, cause those will likely already be cached in the browser
[12:32:38] <shoky> but i dont rly know much bout that
[12:32:39] <LoneStar99> k
[12:32:41] <LoneStar99> thank
[12:32:45] <LoneStar99> s
[12:35:13] <LoneStar99> min still includes "fadeIn" etc right?
[12:35:36] <shoky> it includes exactly the same stuff
[12:35:55] <LoneStar99> ok cool
[12:35:58] <LoneStar99> thanks
[13:04:19] <cablegunmaster_> fixed my problem with a dirty work around... >.> but it works...
[13:20:21] <HarryPitfall> Anyone knows a really good "checklistbox" and "checkcombobox" widget for jQuery/UI?
[13:28:40] <johnkpaul> HarryPitfall: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[13:32:28] <HarryPitfall> the select part is very good
[13:32:33] <HarryPitfall> very good widget
[13:50:36] <Dr4g> Hey guys, setting up a skeleton project, adding in some necessary files. I have the h5bp HTML structure in..
[13:50:40] <Dr4g> I have jQuery and Modernizr
[13:50:46] <Dr4g> Twitter bootstrap CSS
[13:50:50] <Dr4g> What else do you guys suggest?
[13:51:21] <tw2113> a piece of your soul
[13:51:29] <tw2113> make this a horcrux
[13:53:56] <Dr4g> tw2113: good shout ;-)
[13:56:14] <g0z> when I assign the value of $("#cat").css("top") to a variable when I use it later in my script I get back a value of "[object Window]" instead of a px value but if I do the reference inline it works, any idea what could cause something like this?
[14:08:17] <wavez> How do I create new private members on my jqGrid instance? Inside the function for the gridComplete event, do I use this.myVar = 0; ?
[14:09:38] <shoky> g0z: sounds like you're accessing 'this' when it is the global window object
[14:17:15] <wavez> shoky, inside the function for the gridComplete event? I know that $(this) allows me to call methods like .jqGrid()
[14:18:38] <marrow> how do i change this each-loop in this RSS parser http://jsfiddle.net/kTDMS/ to a for-loop? I'm quite the newb. I've made an attempt (  http://jsfiddle.net/ue2fD/1/ ) but an error occurs, seems like I don't index the data.value.items array properly
[14:20:07] <vandunk> Can anyone tell me why $(document).ready(function() { $('body').hide().fadeIn(1000); }); doesn't work properly when using the browser back button? (display: none;) remains
[14:20:24] <vandunk> works fine on some websites, doesn't work on others.
[14:28:11] <Mark_Morcom> Hi, can someone help me I am trying to understand how I can make this code re-usable: http://paste.bradleygill.com/index.php?paste_id=380758
[14:28:36] <Mark_Morcom> The above example points to a click event of a div with the class hm_news
[14:29:23] <tw2113> turn everything inside the click function into its own function, then call the newly created function on click
[14:29:33] <Mark_Morcom> I want to repeat that in a neat way for other classes, but without repeating the process. I only want to change the click event and the content that is grabed
[14:30:27] <Mark_Morcom> Ok, I have no idea how to create a JS funtion - I am a PHP designer, but I will look it up
[14:30:40] <Mark_Morcom> Thanks tw2113
[14:30:54] <tw2113> chances are it won't be much different than php function declarations
[14:31:02] <zim> Hi all. How would I user a var to assign a button name in .dialog ? I have tried buttons: { dialog.button_text : function() { where  dialog.button_text is the var
[14:31:16] <Mark_Morcom> I suspect so, then I will be styling :)
[14:32:23] <tw2113> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/function.html
[14:32:27] <g0z> shoky not using this at all
[14:33:14] <Mark_Morcom> Sorry tw2113 - I think I get it. But will a function receive var's that are defined outside of the function. Are the var's global in other words?
[14:33:53] <tw2113> not completely sure
[14:34:01] <tw2113> at worst, you have to pass some values in
[14:34:48] <Mark_Morcom> Like functionName(varOne, varTwo)
[14:34:53] <tw2113> yup
[14:35:01] <Mark_Morcom> Ah, it is like PHP :)
[14:37:02] <apeiros_> hi there
[14:37:21] <apeiros_> what function does $.ajax use to convert the data attribute passed to it?
[14:38:52] <HarryPitfall> zim, buttons is a associative object, I believe that js don't accept to declare the 'key' inline like this
[14:39:01] <HarryPitfall> you can do in other way
[14:39:19] <HarryPitfall> var buttons = {}; buttons['the caption'] = function() {};
[14:39:51] <HarryPitfall> or buttons[dialog.button_text] = function() {} in your case
[14:40:04] <zim> HarryPitfall: TY will have a look
[14:40:30] <HarryPitfall> I still need to find some widgets to finish my 'dialog system', blergh
[14:40:45] <HarryPitfall> checklistbox, checked combo box and a good html editor (rich)
[15:01:55] <vandunk> Has anyone come across fadeout not working correctly for page transitions when the link has no extension?
[15:02:28] <vandunk> The new page has display: none set and it doesn't change back with fadein
[15:22:18] <vandunk> Anyone know how to get $(document).ready to fire when the back button is used? I'm guessing it doesn't because the page is cached (although exactly the same script works on another website of mine?)
[15:25:46] <vandunk> I'm using fadeOut when a link is clicked, but using back reverts the page to it's last state (with display: none set because of fadeOut)
[15:29:14] <apeiros_> hm, is there an equivalent to $.parseJSON for the other way round?
[15:29:45] <apeiros_> I know most browsers have JSON.stringify, but I'd like to have a fallback if notâ€¦

[16:20:58] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:26:25] <whomp_> i have an issue. once my page loads and everything is rendered, i want two different images to come together at the center: one moving from the right, one moving from the left. i want each of them to start off right outside the page itself, so that the user cannot see the images until they start moving towards the center. once the images reach the center, when a user mouses over either of the images, i want them to move together further, so that they now ov
[16:26:25] <whomp_> erlap. when the user's mouse leaves the two images, i want the images to move back to where they were after the animation finished. can anyone help me with doing this? thanks.
[16:28:28] <whomp_> i have tried using an inline-block as a horizontal separator, and merge my images my making the separator smaller, but then i can't seem to make the images overlap when a user puts their mouse over the images
[16:34:59] <vandunk> Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this? var url = window.location.href; url = url.substr(url.lastIndexOf("/") + 1); $(".transition").find('a[href="' + url + '"]').addClass("current");
[16:36:01] <vandunk> i'm trying to look at all links with class="transition" and add the current class to them if their href = the current url
[16:36:46] <shoky> vandunk: is it finding any elements?
[16:37:44] <shoky> is your substr giving you the correct url?
[16:37:45] <shoky> etc.
[16:37:46] <apeiros_> vandunk: with url = "http://example.com/foo/bar/baz.html" you'll get "baz.html"
[16:37:53] <apeiros_> doubt you want thatâ€¦
[16:38:31] <vandunk> i just want say.. "bar.php", because the href will be equal to bar.php
[16:38:43] <shoky> vandunk: which part of it is not working
[16:38:47] <vandunk> i'm basically trying to highlight a link if it links to the current page
[16:38:55] <vandunk> it's not adding the class
[16:38:55] <shoky> and dont say 'they dont get highlighted'
[16:39:03] <vandunk> :S
[16:39:04] <shoky> vandunk: is it finding any elements?
[16:39:08] <shoky> break up your code :\
[16:39:11] <shoky> PROGRAMMING
[16:39:24] <vandunk> how would i know if it was finding any elements?
[16:39:31] <shoky> heard of console.log
[16:39:32] <shoky> ?
[16:39:36] <vandunk> oke
[16:39:44] <apeiros_> $(".transition").length
[16:39:48] <apeiros_> if it gives 0 it found nothing
[16:40:06] <apeiros_> just go step by step through your code and see where it fails to meet your expectation
[16:45:36] <whomp_> i have an issue. once my page loads and everything is rendered, i want two different images to come together at the center: one moving from the right, one moving from the left. i want each of them to start off right outside the page itself, so that the user cannot see the images until they start moving towards the center. once the images reach the center, when a user mouses over either of the images, i want them to move together further, so that they now ov

[16:45:38] <vandunk> seems to be returning them fine
[16:45:46] <vandunk> finding them
[16:46:11] <rhino_> how can I set the value of a dropdown back to the first option?  have tried $('.class').val('');
[16:47:25] <vandunk> ..problem has to be here: $(".transition").find('a[href="' + url + '"]').addClass("current");
[16:55:21] <whomp_> shoky, any ideas?
[16:57:06] <vandunk> whomp_, what part are you stuck on?
[17:02:01] <wathek> Hi everybody
[17:02:40] <wathek> I'm trying to use the resizable function from jquery-ui on a div that has position set to absolute and that contains an image
[17:02:42] <shoky> vandunk: what is:  $(".transition").find('a[href="' + url + '"]').length
[17:03:05] <wathek> when I don't set any containment it works ok but it goes out of the workspace that should limit it
[17:03:07] <shoky> whomp_: i donno, you just do it.. i'd do it all with absolute positioning
[17:03:24] <wathek> if I add the containment the div freezes and I cannot make it bigger
[17:04:20] <whomp_> aight. and is there an easy way to give images a glow effect in jquery?
[17:04:37] <shoky> that'd be css
[17:04:57] <whomp_> kk thx
[17:08:04] <vandunk> shoky: 0
[17:08:33] <shoky> vandunk: then it _doesnt_ seem to be finding them fine..
[17:08:34] <vandunk> i think i've figured out that it's not finding
[17:08:36] <vandunk> sure
[17:08:50] <vandunk> hm, i've tried many different things but can't seem to get it to find anything, i'll keep trying
[17:08:50] <vandunk> thanks
[17:09:03] <vandunk> it can find classes fine
[17:09:16] <shoky> vandunk ah
[17:09:30] <shoky> your <a>'s themselves are the ones with "transition" calss?
[17:09:31] <shoky> class
[17:09:46] <vandunk> yeah, those are within a span with class navitem though
[17:09:57] <vandunk> so $(".navitem").find('.transition').length
[17:10:00] <shoky> vandunk:  $('.transition[href="'+url+'"]').addClass("current")
[17:10:00] <vandunk> that returns 6
[17:10:07] <shoky> .find looks only for descendants
[17:10:32] <vandunk> ahhhh
[17:10:55] <shoky> or you could replace .find with .filter

[17:47:34] <ajoros> wathek , can you check it out? any input from u?
[17:48:34] <wathek> I'm sorry I'm already trying to fix my bug with the resizable function
[17:54:03] <wathek> any one can help me please
[17:54:13] <wathek> could you please help me to fix the resizable elements ? http://wathek.homelinux.org/wathek/createur/?tid=1&cid=1
[17:54:19] <wathek> as you can see I cannot resize the penguin image
[18:16:38] <shoky> ajoros: since you are loading a new page on each click on the tree items.. you'd need your php to do the job of knowing which items were already clicked before
[18:17:23] <shoky> ajoros: you could use a session cookie for it, or some other kind of client-local storage for it
[18:17:47] <shoky> but that data needs to be persisted somehow for the session
[18:18:24] <shoky> you could of course not load a whole new page for each item, and instead load the pages' content with ajax
[18:18:49] <shoky> probably that's the best way to go
[18:19:13] <nickhs> Hi! I have the following code http://bpaste.net/show/KcIs56bBvfsIF8zt4RMq/ however the .attr and .addClass calls are not working. What am I doing wrong?
[18:20:00] <shoky> nickhs: what exactly is not working?
[18:20:31] <nickhs> shoky, ever .attr and .addClass call. For example line 9 no id is added to the <li> element.
[18:21:56] <wathek> could you please help me to fix the resizable elements ? http://wathek.homelinux.org/wathek/createur/?tid=1&cid=1 as you can see I cannot resize the penguin image
[18:22:18] <nickhs> shoky, sorry  I lie, adding the src paramaters to the <img>'s works.
[18:23:10] <shoky> nickhs: the <li> is the root element of that o object
[18:23:35] <shoky> nickhs: o.find('li')  or  $('li', o)  only look for descendants of the root
[18:23:42] <shoky> so it will not find the <li>
[18:23:54] <nickhs> shoky, ah, gotcha. So should be $(o).attr('foo', 'bar') ?
[18:24:03] <shoky> o.attr('foo','bar')  yes
[18:24:11] <shoky> adding another $() is redundant
[18:24:16] <nickhs> shoky, awesome, thanks a ton!
[18:24:20] <shoky> np

[18:40:25] <io__> hi i am building a little site mostly on jquery, but i need some kind of cms to handle the content, i am a drupal user but drupal seems to be overkill and a bit slow for my purposes, is there something that can handle fast queries? something very simple?
[18:40:30] <shoky> ;p
[18:40:43] <Jester831> I'm a php programmer, and this is my first jquery plugin ever
[18:41:13] <johnkpaul> ?helpfulhelp @ wathek
[18:41:13] <b-ot> johnkpaul, I offer no help, yet. Help me help you: https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot/blob/master/core.js#L68
[18:41:13] <bot-t1> wathek, http://guipn.com/blog/how-to-get-helpful-help/
[18:41:46] <Jester831> sick! it worked
[18:42:53] <nickhs> I'm trying to do o.prev().after(genListHtml(data, false)); where o is a specific list element (from .each()) - however the html gets added to a number of list elements not just .o's previous element.
[18:43:00] <wathek> johnkpaul, but what I don't understand is that if I write the code seperatly it seems to be working when I embed it into my whole application I cannot resize any image (in the example the penguin image)
[18:44:16] <nickhs> what am I dong wrong?
[18:45:31] <shoky> nickhs: show the code
[18:46:15] <nickhs> http://bpaste.net/show/Cg6EScxlNQxP9Jd83jzw/ shoky
[18:46:17] <shoky> nickhs: also why .prev().after() and not just .before()
[18:46:34] <nickhs> shoky, because I no idea .before existed :(
[18:46:51] <shoky> nickhs: what's that 'return' for ?
[18:47:19] <nickhs> shoky, to exit out of the each loop early once the condition has been found
[18:47:27] <shoky> who said it exits out of the each loop?
[18:47:47] <shoky> you want return false; as the docs for .each say
[18:47:55] <MikeyD> i am implementing a script with a slidedown thing. how can i modify the length of time it takes to slide down, to speed it up: http://pastebin.com/bXThnPTp
[18:48:08] <shoky> actually
[18:48:14] <nickhs> shoky, oops you're right. I want return false;
[18:48:44] <shoky> nickhs: instead of that whole snippet, you can do:  $('ul#music-list li.downloading').first().before(genListblabla)
[18:50:20] <nickhs> shoky, cheers! I'll go test
[18:54:43] <rmurphey> MikeyD: have you read the slidedown docs?
[18:54:48] <rmurphey> ?slideDown @ MikeyD
[18:54:49] <bot-t1> MikeyD, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[18:55:57] <nickhs> shoky, is there a good way to add the li element to the bottom if there is no li.downloading elements?
[18:56:13] <MikeyD> rmurphey: to be honest, no. didnt realize it was using the slidedown from jquery.  i'm not too familiar with this stuff
[18:56:22] <Jester831> shocky: in http://pastebin.com/Aq3iA6ng on line 34, will this.canvas be overridden by other callbacks if I call blend on an array of objects
[18:56:48] <MikeyD> so, if i do $(this).find("ul").stop(true, true).slideDown('fast'); is that the correct format?
[18:57:30] <rmurphey> ?tias
[18:57:31] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[18:59:13] <MikeyD> rmurphey: awesome. you rock
[19:01:22] <MikeyD> rmurphey: ok, next question. in ie7, it only shows about 20% of the width, then when slideDown is complete, the width goes to 100%. is there a way to modify it so it keeps the 100% width during the transition?
[19:07:21] <shoky> nickhs: var newli = getListHTml(..), dl = $('#music-list li.downloading'); if (dl.length) dl.first().before(newli); else newli.appendTo('#music-list');
[19:07:57] <nickhs> shoky, thanks!
[19:12:27] <shoky> Jester831: what do you think 'this' is, at that point?
[19:13:29] <Jester831> the each object?
[19:13:39] <Jester831> but I'm not really sure
[19:14:08] <shoky> createCanvas is only called when the deferred is resolved
[19:14:36] <shoky> and you're not explicitly setting any 'this' context for the resolved-callbacks
[19:15:38] <shoky> you send the 'each object' (ptr) as the first argument though
[19:15:59] <Jester831> oh, so should I do ptr.canvas?
[19:16:16] <Nomikos> I have a simple handler for $('body').keydown(.. which, from what I get from the docs, should only fire once when holding a key down, but it repeats. what am I missing?
[19:16:51] <shoky> Jester831: you should probably use .data() to store your data thats linked with each element
[19:16:58] <Jester831> though, I feel like ptr.canvas is wrong as well
[19:17:30] <shoky> why not $(ptr).data('canvas', canvas)
[19:18:16] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html
[19:18:37] <johnkpaul> you probably want to debounce it
[19:18:39] <Jester831> I suppose... what're the limitations of using .data?
[19:18:45] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery debounce plugin @Nomikos
[19:18:47] <bot-t1> Nomikos, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[19:19:00] <shoky> Jester831: what do you mean?
[19:19:50] <Jester831> I guess I always thought of data as just being able to store like strings
[19:20:07] <Jester831> and used it as a way of importing data from html
[19:20:07] <shoky> it's just a javascript object
[19:20:46] <Jester831> oh I see
[19:21:01] <shoky> nah the data-XXX stuff is just an added bonus with .data()
[19:21:07] <Jester831> nice
[19:21:35] <Jester831> mmmm, I guess that means I could store settings within data as well instead of passing that around
[19:21:42] <shoky> sure
[19:22:10] <shoky> you can do: var data = $(ptr).data;   and then just manipulate that data object
[19:22:16] <shoky> data.canvas = canvas;  etc
[19:22:54] <shoky> er $(ptr).data() that is
[19:27:37] <rmill> ?factoid
[19:27:38] <bot-t1> factoid list: http://bot-t.com/factoids/
[19:27:57] <Jester831> does that create a copy of the data object, or can I write to it directly
[19:28:13] <Jester831> if I do data.canvas = canvas
[19:28:33] <Nomikos> johnkpaul: thanks. this keyboard stuff is a /mess/ :-p
[19:28:52] <johnkpaul> :) no problem, Nomikos, yes, it is fairly messy, but you'll never forget it
[19:29:13] <Nomikos> hmm :-) I'll at least remember that nothing is implementing it in the same way
[19:29:25] <Nomikos> and hardly anything in the right wat
[19:29:26] <b-ot> i dont know which folder i just FTPed into but its an empty one in after FTP
[19:29:27] <Nomikos> *waqy
[19:29:32] <Nomikos> *nevermindactually
[19:29:59] <johnkpaul> haha
[19:30:02] <johnkpaul> wat was oddly appropriate
[19:30:03] <b-ot> if organize and implement the methods used for data types - this is probably it would be happiness!
[19:30:26] <Nomikos> :-p
[19:30:51] <Nomikos> like, chrome will fire both press and down events all the time, for regular keys, but not for cursor keys
[19:31:03] <Nomikos> it doesn't fire 'press' for cursor keys /at all/
[19:32:32] <Nomikos> never mind two cursor keys at the same time
[19:33:03] <Nomikos> (or two regular keys)
[19:34:04] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: :( I wish I had more advice than sympathy http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7300#comment:3
[19:34:19] <Nomikos> haha it's cool, I'll figure something out :-)
[19:34:35] <Nomikos> I'm relieved to at least find I'm not simply blind
[19:34:55] <johnkpaul> no, not at all, it's a known and relatively well documented group of problems
[19:36:05] <Nomikos> I'll just track the down and up events, and make the script remember to repeat the action, ignoring any subsequent presses or downs
[19:36:27] <Nomikos> that way it can also support multiple keys at the same time
[19:36:38] <johnkpaul> yeah, good idea, and good luck!
[19:36:44] <Nomikos> thanks :-)
[19:37:47] <io__> how do i unload content which I ve loaded with .load, i am trying with .empty but i don t want to empty everything, just the previously loaded content
[19:40:52] <mxweas> What does $('tag') actually return? is it a jquery object that references every <tag> in the dom?
[19:41:07] <mxweas> ie, what is the object it returns is what I'm asking :P
[19:47:11] <mxweas> wow so it's an instance of the jQuery object with a few variables (this[0] = elem, the selector and document) set.

[19:56:33] <aaairc> this is the line that isn't working for me:  $(infoHTML).find(".popup_pointer").addClass('top');
[19:56:52] <aaairc> could someone help point me in the right direction? thanks!
[19:57:37] <testetestt> how can i "intercept" all events going to jquery
[19:57:52] <testetestt> or
[19:58:19] <testetestt> how can i overwrite or alter specific jquery functions and then write them to the document
[19:58:32] <testetestt> or hide ajax calls in firebug
[20:01:59] <scr3am> aaairc: it is there if you write it as html... use string functions -> you got a string, no actual DOM
[20:02:34] <Nomikos> aaairc: yeah, you're creating a jQuery object, but then alerting the original HTML. not the same thing
[20:03:05] <Nomikos> try appending it to body and then giving the 'top' class a different bg color
[20:07:55] <testetestt> here is my question
[20:08:04] <testetestt> if i load a webpage's javascript intially
[20:08:14] <testetestt> and then after dom is done loading
[20:08:22] <testetestt> i encrypt the entire javascript
[20:08:29] <testetestt> would it still work
[20:09:00] <testetestt> and if so, how would i find the "entire" javascript, select it, and replace it's text at least visually
[20:12:37] <Nomikos> testetestt: why would you want to do that? the browser needs the regular js to run it, and if the browser has access to it, you can somehow save it
[20:13:02] <testetestt> well assume everyone is a document.ready
[20:13:05] <testetestt> everything
[20:13:07] <testetestt> so it gets loaded
[20:13:10] <testetestt> at the end of loading
[20:13:30] <Nomikos> what stops me from looking at the source and just requesting the .js file?
[20:13:36] <Nomikos> then saving that as text
[20:13:51] <shoky> testetestt: user can just look at the loaded sources and see the original source :\
[20:14:49] <testetestt> shoky, it would show the encrypted, i think
[20:14:54] <shoky> no, it wouldn't
[20:14:57] <testetestt> nomikos, im not sure about that yet
[20:15:01] <shoky> there is absolutely no way to do what you (think) you want
[20:15:04] <Nomikos> it's like trying to stop people from copying/saving images on your website, with a /lot/ of trouble you can make it hard but it's impossible to prevent
[20:15:14] <shoky> testetestt: ABSOLUTELY NO WAY, stop asking about it
[20:15:18] <testetestt> your saying if u made edits on the page it would load
[20:15:22] <testetestt> i think there is
[20:15:28] <shoky> then go find it
[20:15:35] <testetestt> im going to make it
[20:15:45] <shoky> whatever the browser loaded is available to the user
[20:16:10] <Nomikos> you'd have to encrypt the source server side, and let the browser decrypt, then eval() it or something
[20:16:11] <testetestt> i want it to be available
[20:16:23] <shoky> no you want an encrypted version of it to be available
[20:16:24] <shoky> god knows why
[20:16:35] <Nomikos> but you'd *need* to have the decryption routine in plaintext to run it, so ....
[20:16:52] <testetestt> why couldn't i
[20:17:02] <testetestt> have the document.ready load the events in the dom or w/e
[20:17:05] <Nomikos> if it was feasible gmail and friends would have been doing it already
[20:17:10] <shoky> testetestt: whatever the browser can see, the user can see <-------------------------
[20:17:19] <testetestt> then just document.getelementbytagname
[20:17:22] <testetestt> on script
[20:17:24] <shoky> testetestt STFU please
[20:17:27] <testetestt> and delete it
[20:17:29] <shoky> you got your answer
[20:17:33] <shoky> if you dont like it, go elsewhere
[20:17:58] <shoky> because that would only happen AFTER the browser already loaded the original source
[20:18:04] <shoky> testetestt: whatever the browser can see, the user can see <-------------------------
[20:18:14] <testetestt> correct but if u were to view the source, it would not be there
[20:18:20] <testetestt> it would reflect changes
[20:18:21] <shoky> that is not correct
[20:18:23] <shoky> no it wouldn't
[20:18:27] <testetestt> then why does firebug show the changes?
[20:18:28] <Nomikos> testetestt: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1020368/how-to-hide-or-encrypt-javascript-code
[20:18:40] <shoky> if you really want you can look in the network tab in devtools and see exactly what was delivered to your browser
[20:18:40] <testetestt> i know the literature on this but i am trying to invent, is all
[20:18:52] <shoky> it is impossible.
[20:19:13] <Nomikos> firebug doesn't show the source, it shows the DOM
[20:19:31] <Nomikos> the DOM is based on the source after it's interpreted
[20:19:34] <testetestt> your saying right clicking and view source would not reflect changes
[20:19:39] <testetestt> in the dom
[20:19:46] <testetestt> such as new css stylign added with jquery, etc
[20:19:49] <shoky> if you view-source, firefox shows you the original source
[20:20:10] <Nomikos> if you select something and do "show source of selection" THEN you're looking at the DOM
[20:20:19] <Nomikos> subtle but important difference
[20:20:27] <shoky> even if it didn't , i could load it up with a command line http client like wget  that doesnt run any javascript
[20:20:33] <shoky> or i could disable javascript in my browser
[20:20:34] <Nomikos> ^
[20:20:37] <shoky> then no encryption would take place
[20:20:43] <shoky> etc etc etc
[20:20:57] <Nomikos> or in firefox load the url 'view-source:http://example.com/foo.js'
[20:21:25] <testetestt> there must be some way to fake this
[20:21:37] <testetestt> and finally close the web
[20:21:42] <shoky> you'd think that, if you didnt know anything about it
[20:21:53] <testetestt> autotrader.co.uk does this
[20:21:54] <Nomikos> a lot of smart people have done a lot of thinking about it, trust me :-)
[20:22:00] <testetestt> they create javascript on the fly
[20:22:06] <testetestt> doesnt show the ajax request in firebug
[20:22:10] <shoky> so?
[20:22:14] <testetestt> then they delete the javascript
[20:22:41] <shoky> what if i disable javascript before it deletes :\
[20:22:42] <shoky> dude
[20:22:46] <testetestt> so what
[20:22:47] <shoky> stop asking about it
[20:22:49] <shoky> there is no way
[20:23:25] <Nomikos> I'm seeing a bunch of ajax requests for clicks on that page
[20:23:35] <Nomikos> not in firebug, just in the console
[20:23:51] <shoky> also just because firebug might happen to NOT show you something, that doesn't mean it's not available if you really want to get at it
[20:24:02] <shoky> because...... whatever the browser can see, the user can see <-------------------------
[20:24:12] <testetestt> well how could i hash an ajax url
[20:24:27] <testetestt> thats really what this is about
[20:24:30] <testetestt> and heres how u do it
[20:24:36] <Nomikos> you know hashing is not encryption, right?
[20:24:40] <testetestt> yeah
[20:25:00] <testetestt> can u do such a thing
[20:25:07] <shoky> you know you can debug any javascript that is running, WHILE it is running
[20:25:18] <testetestt> i mean
[20:25:20] <testetestt> heres the thing
[20:25:22] <shoky> before it has any chance to encrypt/delete/whatever
[20:25:32] <testetestt> i can have cryptojs encode a string that is the URL
[20:25:46] <testetestt> put that variable in the ajax function
[20:25:58] <testetestt> then when a click event occurs
[20:26:25] <testetestt> i need to intercept the event and unencrypt the variable for the program
[20:26:33] <testetestt> then i need to reencrpt it
[20:26:40] <shoky> man you have no idea what you are talking about
[20:26:46] <testetestt> why
[20:26:46] <b-ot> testetestt, david_mark back?
[20:26:55] <shoky> because you didn't learn
[20:27:06] <testetestt> in this situation
[20:27:18] <testetestt> it wouldnt show up in viewsource
[20:27:21] <shoky> testetestt: you got your answer
[20:27:23] <testetestt> cause it came up a s unecrypted
[20:27:29] <testetestt> and in firebug it doesnt show
[20:27:31] <testetestt> so i just told oyu
[20:27:32] <testetestt> you
[20:27:35] <testetestt> how to do it
[20:27:42] <testetestt> now the problem with this is it still shows on firebug
[20:27:44] <shoky> awesome
[20:27:50] <testetestt> in ajax happens
[20:27:59] <testetestt> so thats the next thing
[20:28:06] <testetestt> shoky, wtf you tell me why this wouldn't work
[20:28:13] <testetestt> it totally would
[20:28:18] <Nomikos> testetestt: short answer: no one knows how to do what you want. If you figure it out, you'll be rich. Good luck!
[20:28:20] <testetestt> are you saying i can't md5 encrypt a url string
[20:28:24] <shoky> great, will you shut up now?
[20:28:31] <shoky> of course you can
[20:28:37] <Nomikos> "md5 encrypt" /what/?
[20:28:39] <shoky> you can hash anything you like
[20:28:46] <testetestt> and decrypt it when an event happens
[20:28:51] <shoky> you can do that too, yes
[20:28:51] <testetestt> and then use the decryption
[20:29:00] <testetestt> in the ajax url param
[20:29:03] <shoky> but you can't prevent the user from seeing the un-encrypted url
[20:29:04] <testetestt> and then recencrypt it
[20:29:05] <Nomikos> you can decrypt md5 ?
[20:29:13] <shoky> er there's that, too
[20:29:15] <testetestt> shoky, you can
[20:29:24] <shoky> testetestt: GOOD THEN STOP ASKING IF YOU ALREADY KNOW
[20:29:30] <testetestt> where do they see the unencrypted url?
[20:29:35] <shoky> in the debugger
[20:29:38] <shoky> debugging your javascript
[20:29:40] <Nomikos> shoky: your blood pressure man, calm down :p
[20:29:41] <shoky> while it is running
[20:29:49] <shoky> Nomikos: yes he's definitely getting to me :)
[20:30:02] <testetestt> adding breakpoints?
[20:30:12] <testetestt> true
[20:30:18] <testetestt> but
[20:30:23] <testetestt> you can turn off firebug debugger
[20:30:26] <shoky> haha
[20:30:46] <shoky> ok so lets tell all our users to turn off their debugger so they cant see our codez
[20:31:04] <testetestt> no
[20:31:06] <testetestt> you can force it
[20:31:07] <testetestt> http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?82700-disable-firebug-on-production-website
[20:31:08] <Nomikos> shoky: no, I guess you'd do it with encrypted javascript
[20:31:11] <testetestt> for example
[20:31:11] <shoky> eh :\
[20:31:21] <testetestt> so u turn off firebug's debugging capabilities
[20:31:22] <shoky> you cant force shit
[20:31:28] <testetestt> please read the above
[20:31:34] <shoky> testetestt: FINE i'll use chrome
[20:31:51] <testetestt> you can turn that off too
[20:31:56] <shoky> i'll fuckin open a socket connection to your serverz and read the data myself
[20:32:02] <shoky> no you cant
[20:32:05] <shoky> you stubborn idiot
[20:32:23] <testetestt> thats what u said about firebug
[20:32:26] <testetestt> anyway this isnt the problem
[20:32:33] <testetestt> the problem is the network panel and seeing the request
[20:32:54] <shoky> lets find a forum that tellz me how to block that!
[20:33:07] <shoky> coz the forum is definitely right
[20:33:11] <testetestt> i only sent that to you so u could look at the code u clearly weren't aware of
[20:33:20] <testetestt> instead of typing it out myself
[20:33:40] <testetestt> but we're close
[20:34:00] * shoky cries
[20:34:39] <Nomikos> that code is from 2008, the first two comments say it doesn't work, the rest are spam
[20:34:53] <Nomikos> and you can open the console *after* the page has loaded and that code has run
[20:35:23] <Nomikos> not to mention browser writers could easily prevent it from working altogether
[20:35:48] <Nomikos> /and/ if you disable JS it won't run at all, and you can still see all the JS code in the source
[20:36:01] <shoky> he's gone
[20:36:08] <Nomikos> thanks
[20:36:18] <Nomikos> didn't notice
[20:37:02] * Nomikos remembers when he was *sure* he could get around the limitations of perpetuum mobiles...
[20:37:24] <shoky> ;]
[20:49:54] <batmanbond3d> Hey, I am looking for some advice on a project I am wokring on
[20:51:35] <batmanbond3d> I am building some widget that makes editing and displaying data
[20:51:50] <batmanbond3d> and this is to be a pure javascript widget
[20:53:50] <batmanbond3d> The way I want it to work is, you provide this widget with your data and some configuration describing your data restrictions and some layout on how you want your data to be displayed for viewing/editing, and my widget will take care of the rest
[20:54:44] <Nomikos> that sounds a bit vague. are you having trouble with specific parts?
[20:55:19] <Nomikos> is it a wysiwyg editor, or a data visualization tool, or a graphing library ..?
[20:55:49] <abjorn> imsky: yoooo
[20:56:03] <batmanbond3d> No, just looking for some feedback on the project in general
[20:57:17] <azbyin> hi all..
[20:57:31] <batmanbond3d> more like a data visualization tool, but I am making it so it can display any data you can imagine and and render it pretty much any way you want
[20:57:39] <batmanbond3d> let me give you a screenshot
[20:57:44] <azbyin> i want to increment the left-value of a background-position property. whats the nbest way to do this?
[20:58:19] <azbyin> i.e. $("#mydiv").css('background-position')  returns "0px 0px"
[20:58:30] <Nomikos> azbyin: try backgroundPosition
[20:58:32] <azbyin> i want to make it "31px 0px"
[20:58:58] <Nomikos> azbyin: '-' doesn't work in those selectors, so the convention is to use camelCasing instead
[20:58:58] <batmanbond3d> http://www.asportsmanager.com/GridScreen.png
[20:59:25] <azbyin> yes, sorry i made a typoe just now
[20:59:39] <azbyin> Nomikos, but what about adding the 'px' ?
[20:59:51] <Nomikos> azbyin: then simply give your new values as second parameter to the .css() method
[21:00:16] <Nomikos> $("#mydiv").css('backgroundPosition', '31px 0px')
[21:00:28] <azbyin> thats the problem
[21:00:47] <Nomikos> well, does that work -^ ?
[21:00:49] <azbyin> i want the left value to be incremented, but the top value to remain 0px
[21:00:52] <azbyin> sure it does
[21:00:55] <Nomikos> aah
[21:01:09] <azbyin> you understand what i want, right?
[21:01:47] <batmanbond3d> parseInt($("#mydiv").css('backgroundPosition'))
[21:01:53] <Nomikos> yeah.. I don't know /too/ much about this though. I *know* you can do it with some applied string-fu, but there maybe shortcuts for it
[21:01:59] <batmanbond3d> will get you the value in PX of the top
[21:02:36] <batmanbond3d> perhaps for safety do parseInt($("#mydiv").css('backgroundPosition'), 10)
[21:02:56] <Nomikos> batmanbond3d: seeing the screenshot, that's a ambitious project
[21:03:13] <azbyin> batmanbond3d, huh? what is parseInt doing?
[21:03:47] <batmanbond3d> $("#mydiv").css('backgroundPosition') that will return '31px 0px' for example
[21:03:53] <shoky> isn't it background-position-x and background-position-y
[21:03:56] <Nomikos> ?parseint
[21:03:57] <bot-t1> Nomikos, remove "parseInt" and speed up some div - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4311
[21:04:04] <Nomikos> damnit :-p
[21:04:05] <Nomikos> wrong one
[21:04:08] <azbyin> batmanbond3d, no it doesn;t!
[21:04:11] <azbyin> try it yourself
[21:04:18] <azbyin> it will return only the first number
[21:04:26] <azbyin> shoky is correct
[21:04:31] <azbyin> you need 2 values
[21:04:47] <batmanbond3d> I did try it myself and document.write(parseInt('50px 20px')) writes 50
[21:05:11] <azbyin> uh, you mean i extract that value and then add 31 myself and then set it again?
[21:05:26] <Nomikos> backgroundPosition with two space-delimited values works as well, I'm using that somewhere
[21:05:28] <azbyin> doesn;t jquery have string foo within itself to simply add automatically?
[21:05:55] <shoky> wat?
[21:05:55] <b-ot> BTW there's a QtSql tutorial here that covers opening a db and using QSqlTableModel, etc. If js's decided you aren't worth shit.
[21:07:00] <shoky> azbyin: you can .css(
[21:07:02] <shoky> oops
[21:07:10] <azbyin> $("#m").css("backgroundPosition")  returns "0px 0px"
[21:07:19] <azbyin> now i want it to become "31px 0px"
[21:07:28] <azbyin> i hope this makes my question as clear as possible
[21:07:28] <shoky> azbyin: you can .css({'background-position-x': '+=20', 'background-position-y': '+=100'})
[21:07:37] <azbyin> finally an answer
[21:07:50] <Nomikos> azbyin: try http://stackoverflow.com/a/5899768/126584
[21:07:52] <azbyin> i can deal with the x and y position separately
[21:07:54] <Nomikos> duh.. too late :p
[21:09:00] <azbyin> Nomikos, also i notice that both "background-position" and backgroundPosition" work fine
[21:09:12] <azbyin> it is in plain js that it doesn;t work
[21:09:13] <Nomikos> well, that used to not be the case
[21:09:20] <shoky> jquery is helping out there
[21:09:24] <azbyin> indeed
[21:09:30] <Nomikos> TIL
[21:09:42] <azbyin> much easier to deal with the css property exactly as it is named
[21:09:45] <shoky> That Is Lame ?
[21:09:53] <Nomikos> Today I Learned :-p
[21:09:58] <shoky> LoL
[21:10:01] <shoky> me too, then
[21:10:10] <batmanbond3d> So my screenshot is a screenshot of a working example
[21:12:36] <batmanbond3d> In the screenshot, the grid supports validation, unique cascading fields, multiple values inside a column, tabs, row sorting, CRUD operations, fixed rows, data history undo
[21:13:32] <azbyin> shoky, actually background-position-x doesn;'t work
[21:13:43] <azbyin> $("#m").css({"background-position-x": "+=10", "background-position-y": "0px"})
[21:14:52] <azbyin> i really want $("#m").css("background-position", "+=10  0")   but ofcourse that is not possible
[21:15:01] <Nomikos> have you tried it>?
[21:15:07] <azbyin> sure i did
[21:15:12] <azbyin> thats the first thing i tries!
[21:15:16] <azbyin> *tried
[21:15:17] <shoky> then why not css('background-position-x', '+=10')
[21:15:18] <Nomikos> just checking
[21:15:42] <azbyin> shoky, doesn;t work
[21:15:45] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jxV23/
[21:15:58] <shoky> er if you leave out the y it works too ..
[21:16:49] <azbyin> if you only have $("#m").css("background-position", "+=10")  it increments the x value properly but makes the y value 50%
[21:16:53] <Nomikos> only works in Chrome for me, fwiw, not ff or safari
[21:17:06] <azbyin> this is as specified, i.e. if only 1 value is specified, the second value becomes 50%
[21:17:25] <shoky> Nomikos: that's cause of the requestAnimationFrame i guess
[21:17:37] <Nomikos> ah
[21:17:46] <batmanbond3d> Here is the code that is needed to generate the grid
[21:17:47] <batmanbond3d> http://pastebin.com/qSU8qgkT
[21:18:34] <azbyin> so i guess there is no other way than to extract the value and increment and then set it myself
[21:18:46] <Nomikos> batmanbond3d: that's using a GridViewControl class, which no doubt has an API
[21:19:07] <Nomikos> batmanbond3d: I'll say again, obviously it's possible but it's ambitious
[21:19:33] <shoky> azbyin then dont do that
[21:19:41] <shoky> azbyin if you wanna change x, then change x
[21:19:52] <azbyin> i.e: l = parseInt($("#m").css("background-position")); l+=31; $("#m").css("background-position", l + "px 0px");
[21:19:54] <shoky> background-position is not a numeric property so obviously +=10 won't work on it
[21:20:13] <azbyin> shoky, background-position-x does *not* work
[21:20:13] <shoky> why are you still using background-position ?
[21:20:17] <batmanbond3d> This is my gridview control
[21:20:22] <azbyin> didn;'t you see me mention that earlier?
[21:20:49] <shoky> i saw you mention <azbyin> if you only have $("#m").css("background-position", "+=10")
[21:21:16] <shoky> seems fine: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jxV23/3/
[21:21:25] <Nomikos> azbyin: simplified version http://jsfiddle.net/jxV23/4/
[21:21:39] <azbyin> you cut out part of my line there: <azbyin> if you only have $("#m").css("background-position", "+=10")  it increments the x value properly but makes the y value 50%
[21:21:40] <Nomikos> that works in firefox, just click the click clicker
[21:21:58] <shoky> azbyin: obviously, i told you why
[21:21:59] <shoky> wtf
[21:22:03] <shoky> dont set background-position
[21:22:13] <shoky> its not numeric
[21:22:16] <shoky> like background-position-x
[21:23:01] <azbyin> $("#m").css("background-position-x", "+=10") does not work for me?
[21:23:07] <azbyin> didn;t you see me say that?
[21:23:24] <shoky> it works in the fiddle..
[21:24:14] <Nomikos> in chrome
[21:24:27] <rhino_> is it possible to get the id of a selected optin of a dropdown using jquery's this command?
[21:24:42] <Nomikos> attr('id') should work
[21:25:22] <rhino_> Nomikos, but I just need it for the selected option, not the actual select
[21:25:59] <shoky> weird
[21:26:03] <Nomikos> yeah, so you somehow get the selected option, and then add .attr('id'); I'm a bit hazy on the selected option part myself, though
[21:26:27] <Nomikos> :selected maybe
[21:26:35] <azbyin> Nomikos, http://jsfiddle.net/jxV23/6/  check that and look at your console output
[21:26:55] <azbyin> after everytime you click what happens to the full background-position property
[21:27:21] <Nomikos> azbyin: I see what you mean
[21:27:28] <azbyin> finally
[21:27:38] <Nomikos> though the cat stays in place, it doesn't shift or anything, but you'd like to keep it at "0px" I guess
[21:28:40] <azbyin> yes, i don;t want some future update to ff or other browsers to "actually implement the functionality properly" and then break my application because i was lazy
[21:28:41] <rhino_> Nomikos:  I can usually do this:    $(".medchangedunit option:selected").attr('Id') but I have a situation where I need to use the this comand instead of the class
[21:28:46] <shoky> azbyin ok how's http://jsfiddle.net/jxV23/7/
[21:28:56] <Nomikos> rhino_: which this command?
[21:30:18] <azbyin> right, we are back to my original idea of parsing and updating the value and setting it manually
[21:30:24] <azbyin> anyway, i'll just do that then
[21:31:07] <Nomikos> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/jxV23/9/
[21:31:13] <Nomikos> happy now ;-p
[21:31:56] <Nomikos> damnit shoky , will you stop beating me to it
[21:33:23] <rhino_> Nomikos:  $('#meddunit'+this.id "option:selected").attr('Id')  where is my syntax screwed up here, once I get the syntax working correctly, it should work
[21:33:36] <Nomikos> rhino_: lowercase 'id' ?
[21:34:13] <Nomikos> rhino_: and possibly the +this.id, this is a tricky beast in JS, doublecheck it refers to the correct element/object
[21:34:16] <batmanbond3d> so any comments on my data editing and displaying widget?
[21:35:31] <Nomikos> rhino_: ehr, also, that syntax is indeed off, you need another '+' in the selector I think
[21:36:00] <Nomikos> and a space before `option`, prolly
[21:36:22] <rhino_> Nomikos:  where should it go, I'm actually getting an unexpected string error
[21:36:43] <Nomikos> try $('#meddunit' + this.id + " option:selected").attr('Id')
[21:36:46] <Nomikos> ehr
[21:36:52] <Nomikos> $('#meddunit' + this.id + " option:selected").attr('id')
[21:37:37] <Nomikos> and use the same quotes for both, for bonus points
[21:38:07] <rhino_> Nomikos:  when I alert that, it just alerts undefined
[21:38:27] <Nomikos> what does it say for alert(this.id);
[21:39:14] <Nomikos> rhino_: got a jsfiddle that we can poke at?
[21:40:04] <rhino_> Nomikos:  it alerts the proper id
[21:40:20] <rhino_> will throw up a fiddle right now
[21:41:45] <shoky> rhino_ what do you think that 'this' is referencing to, and why ?
[21:42:38] <rhino_> shoky: this is referencing the id of a button I am clicking on
[21:42:51] <shoky> this is the id of the button ?
[21:42:52] <rhino_> the elements of that btn.
[21:45:16] <rhino_> Nomikos:  http://jsfiddle.net/bVQaP/
[21:45:42] <shoky> fiddles need to work ;p
[21:47:11] <Nomikos> rhino_: "http://localhost/cpainproto/plugins/" is not loading for me :-p
[21:47:15] <nait> hello! how to set http proxy in jquery?
[21:47:31] <shoky> Nomikos: why are you using ids on the options?
[21:47:36] <shoky> oops i meant rhino_
[21:48:10] <shoky> rhino_: i think you want to use value , not id
[21:48:31] <rhino_> shoky, the setup i'm having to work w/ is quite screwed up, so I basically have to
[21:48:56] <shoky> yeah but you have for example two options with id=""
[21:49:02] <rhino_> they display one value, but want another value inserted into the db
[21:49:10] <rhino_> shoky^^
[21:49:24] <Nomikos> rhino_: http://jsfiddle.net/bVQaP/1/
[21:49:27] <shoky> the value isnt displayed anyway
[21:49:56] <rhino_> ah, didn't realize I could set that for options
[21:49:58] <Nomikos> you needed a ' ' before option in the selector, #medunit was spelled with double d, image replaced by span with that class and id
[21:50:20] <Nomikos> now if this is the best way to do what you want, I don't know :-p but it's working here
[21:50:38] <rhino_> Nomikos:  so what would it actually look like then?
[21:50:49] <Nomikos> rhino_: like the url I posted above
[21:51:28] <Nomikos> and yeah, what shoky says
[21:53:54] <coldhead> remember when that guy was going on and on about encrypted javascript?
[21:54:01] <shoky> rhino_: look how simple it becomes when you do it right: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bVQaP/2/
[21:54:04] <coldhead> those were the days
[21:54:30] * shoky shudders
[21:54:56] <Nomikos> he was simply wrong, it happens. A /lot/.
[21:55:15] <shoky> being wrong is great
[21:55:23] <shoky> if you don't suck
[21:55:52] <shoky> what that means, i dont know
[21:56:47] <coldhead> it's that line of socrates, about the only true knowledge being the knowing that you know nothing
[21:57:02] <rhino_> shoky, Nomikos:  thank you both :)
[21:57:32] <Nomikos> He was also a bit stubborn in his belief that was he wanted could be done, I guess you have to be proven wrong a few times to learn that sometimes you're wrong :p
[21:58:03] <shoky> he was an idiot bordering on troll :P
[21:58:11] <Nomikos> nah
[21:58:13] <rhino_> yes, I admit, I was wrong, LOL
[21:58:19] <Nomikos> idiot, maybe, troll no, just naive
[21:58:20] <shoky> you can't prove anything to him
[21:58:24] <shoky> because he wouldn't understand
[21:58:33] <shoky> nor would he try to
[21:58:36] <Nomikos> rhino_: we're talking about someone else :-p
[21:59:18] <rhino_> ah, missed the beginning of the convo
[22:01:29] <Nomikos> johnkpaul-afk: ps, got it to work! :-p
[22:01:50] <Nomikos> that guy is gonna be like "whothef is Nomikos?" when he wakes up
[22:10:53] <rhino_> Nomikos:  how would I go about getting the text for the selected option?
[22:12:38] <Nomikos> rhino_: .text() on the option object
[22:14:34] <rhino_> Nomikos:  following shokys advice, I changed the option id's to values, and thried changing the code you sent me to this   alert($("#medunit" + this.id + "option:selected").text());, but it just alerts empty
[22:15:07] <Nomikos> rhino_: you need an extra space before options ->  ` + " option:selected"`
[22:15:35] <Nomikos> rhino_: you have to look at what the complete string will look like inside the $(...)
[22:15:59] <Nomikos> "#medunit246option:selected" will obviously not work
[22:19:11] <rhino_> Nomikos:  thanks again:)
[22:19:15] <Nomikos> np :)
[23:09:48] <aZnmAn> is there a reason why this wouldn't be working? $(e.sourceNode).closest('.whitelist-box').find('input.collection_base_uri').attr('value').replace('%id%', ref_id);
[23:10:19] <aZnmAn> getting $(e.sourceNode).closest(".whitelist-box").find("input.collection_base_uri").attr("value") is undefined
[23:22:48] <Nomikos> aZnmAn: for input values there is .val()
[23:23:06] <Nomikos> leaving it empty returns the current value, giving it a param sets that as the new value
[23:24:23] <Nomikos> I /think/ you'd have to split to two lines, so you can set var x to the right element, then do x.val(x.val().replace('%id%', ref_id));
[23:25:46] <gavimobile> how can I prevent the link from jumping to the top http://flamingocare.org/temp.php
[23:26:14] <Nomikos> Don't use a href attribute
[23:26:40] <gavimobile> button?
[23:26:42] <Nomikos> you can style the link blue/underlined with css, and cursor: pointer;
[23:27:03] <gavimobile> Nomikos: got ya
[23:27:13] <Nomikos> an <a id='toggle'> will still be clickable, but it's less "visible"
[23:27:27] <gavimobile> ill use p
[23:27:30] <gavimobile> and style it
[23:27:32] <gavimobile> with a  class
[23:28:03] <gavimobile> excellent! thanks
[23:28:04] <Nomikos> hmm.. semantics-wise, there's probably something to say for the A tag, but either works
[23:30:03] <Nomikos> gavimobile: note that the <p> stretches all across the page by default (block element I think)
[23:30:27] <Nomikos> I can click it on the right-hand side of the window
[23:33:58] <sweb> $(function()   == $(document).ready() ?
[23:34:17] <Nomikos> pretty much
[23:51:00] <phr> guys this is my script. it's loaded and it's working when initialized directly in my php. how can i make it work with an external link? thank you
[23:51:03] <phr> http://jsfiddle.net/Y3RwE/
[23:52:52] <Nomikos> phr: external link as in a different server than on which it is hosted?
[23:53:10] <phr> Nomikos no, i meant, i want to make a link to my .js file
[23:53:28] <phr> for now it's exectued between <body> and with <script> tags..
[23:53:45] <Nomikos> that should work. just make sure it's linked after the jQuery script <link>
[23:53:53] <Nomikos> ehr, <script src>
[23:54:03] <phr> i've tried that, but it doesnt work for me..
[23:54:23] <phr> i want to clean up a little bit, that's why i wanted to add all js to a js file
[23:54:27] <Nomikos> phr: gotta url? are you getting any errors?
[23:54:42] <phr> Nomikos no, i'm not getting any errors :)
[23:54:49] <Nomikos> are you checking for any? :-)
[23:55:16] <Nomikos> FF -> error console is handy, or the webdev console
[23:55:38] <phr> i know man
[23:56:01] <phr> but since my alert box doesnt pop up, i dont think my external js script gets initialized
[23:56:02] <Nomikos> phr: maybe not related but you have four function defs near the top, those can go outside of the jQuery "tags", in the global window scope
[23:56:23] <phr> and that's what i want to do.. let the functions run from external script link..
[23:56:59] <Nomikos> ok, so put them outside of the $(document).read( stuff, just above or below it should be fine, in the same external file
[23:57:00] <phr> Nomikos in other words?
[23:57:22] <phr> hmm
[23:57:55] <phr> i dont really follow you
[23:57:56] <Nomikos> say like so http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=09SM4YzM
[23:58:15] <phr> oh
[23:58:25] <phr> okay, let me see/try :)
[23:58:33] <Nomikos> having those function reference jQuery is fine, they are not run until jQuery has initialized (..usually)
[23:58:57] <Nomikos> phr: and keep an eye on the console
[23:59:08] <phr> i see
[23:59:14] <Nomikos> (that thing is /amazingly/ useful)
[23:59:31] <phr> i thought there's an init function or something to initialize the script
[23:59:47] <phr> since i'm complete noob with jquery..
[23:59:59] <Nomikos> yeah, that's "$(document).ready(function() {"
