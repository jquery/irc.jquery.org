[00:00:48] <pootpoot> i got it thanks
[00:00:50] <wwalser> pootpoot: nextPost may have nothing in it. A call to most methods within jQuery returns an object (the jQuery collection)
[00:00:55] <wwalser> but that collection could be empty
[00:01:02] <pootpoot> right i think thats what was happening
[00:01:07] <wwalser> okay, awesome
[00:01:14] <pootpoot> thats so tricky
[00:01:22] <pootpoot> you always have to check if .length then
[00:01:33] <wwalser> a check against nextPost.length will resolve the problem
[00:01:33] <wwalser> yeah
[00:01:45] <ajpiano> it's tricky in the same sense that riding a horse is tricky
[00:02:03] <wwalser> is riding a horse tricky?
[00:02:05] <ajpiano> it is perhaps difficult at first, but millions of people have learnt to do it throughout history
[00:02:10] <Double_rainbow> ajpiano: hey hi dude
[00:02:19] <ajpiano> hi
[00:02:21] <Double_rainbow> ajpiano: can you help me with my question
[00:02:25] <ajpiano> it's so intense
[00:02:36] <ajpiano> Double_rainbow: can you answer my question
[00:02:39] <ajpiano> what is it?
[00:02:53] <Double_rainbow> ajpiano: is there an example where when i scroll down, it scrolls horizontally instead of vertically?
[00:02:56] <coldhead> what does it mean
[00:03:00] <ajpiano> Double_rainbow: right
[00:03:02] <ajpiano> what is "it"
[00:03:08] <wwalser> I didn't know of an example Double_rainbow sry
[00:03:15] <ajpiano> you scroll it... it scrolls...
[00:03:17] <ajpiano> what is it?
[00:03:19] <Double_rainbow> the page
[00:03:31] <Double_rainbow> it = the whole page
[00:03:37] <ajpiano> like with the mousewheel or whatnot?
[00:03:49] <ajpiano> i don't know of any examples of that off hand
[00:03:52] <ajpiano> it sounds like a really bad idea
[00:03:55] <Double_rainbow> yes the mose wheel
[00:03:59] <Double_rainbow> mousewheel
[00:05:19] <Double_rainbow> so is it even remotely possible?
[00:06:12] <ajpiano> maybe, give me a sec
[00:07:03] <wwalser> http://deanoakley.com/
[00:07:07] <wwalser> that site does it
[00:07:33] <wwalser> I think if a website that I regularly went to did that I would no longer regularly go to it :p
[00:08:18] <ajpiano> good find there wwalser
[00:08:21] <ajpiano> Double_rainbow: yeah ^^
[00:08:46] <ajpiano> http://deanoakley.com/wp-content/themes/deanoakley/js/thw.js
[00:09:01] <ajpiano> just overwrite mousewheel and force it to do some arbitrary scroll essentially
[00:10:36] <loopyduck> Hello, is there a function that slides a div up and down, but only for a certain height?
[00:10:58] <loopyduck> suppose i have an image and i only want to slide up and down for half of the image.
[00:12:18] <Double_rainbow> thanks wwalser, that was exactly what i was looking for
[00:12:27] <wwalser> np, best of luck
[00:12:38] <coldhead> wwalser++
[00:13:36] <dannyzb> Whats up people
[00:13:43] <ajpiano> ffuuu
[00:13:48] <wwalser> ?
[00:14:03] <ajpiano> i made him this awesome demo
[00:14:04] <ajpiano> http://jsbin.com/ubunef/2/edit
[00:14:18] <ajpiano> even http://jsbin.com/ubunef/2
[00:14:27] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell Double_rainbow http://jsbin.com/ubunef/2
[00:14:27] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[00:14:47] <coldhead> lol
[00:15:06] <the_dud3> Heh
[00:15:20] <the_dud3> !topic http://jsbin.com/ubunef/2
[00:15:28] <wwalser> so... on the note of horizontal scrolling
[00:15:28] <wwalser> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[00:15:43] <ajpiano> lol
[00:15:50] <wwalser> -_-"
[00:15:59] <Double_rainbow> what is it?
[00:16:00] <Brandonn> that horizontal scroll is trippy
[00:16:00] <bot-t> (1 min 33 secs ago) <ajpiano> tell Double_rainbow http://jsbin.com/ubunef/2
[00:16:13] <wwalser> it scrolls one slide at a time
[00:16:29] <ajpiano> there's a difference between a slide deck in html and an actual website
[00:16:50] <wwalser> I know, just thought it was funny that you had done something similar in the past
[00:16:57] <wwalser> is that deck up to date aj?
[00:17:03] <dannyzb> Something for you to think about : how could you redesign so that you didn't need a custom scroller ?
[00:17:04] <ajpiano> hehe
[00:17:09] <ajpiano> yeah it is pretty up to date
[00:17:15] <wwalser> okay, I'll have a look at it
[00:17:17] <nail_> loopyduck: there's .animate()
[00:17:18] <dannyzb> I noticed that most of the time custom scrollers are part of a design too messy for most users
[00:17:25] <wwalser> been considering some reafactorings around here using the widget factory
[00:18:08] <jnylen> hi all, I'm writing a plugin to toggle checkboxes when their rows are clicked, so I need to be able to tell if the current event target is a label pointing to a particular checkbox.  does anyone know how to do that?
[00:18:45] <dannyzb> add all checkbox-pointing labels a class ?
[00:18:59] <dannyzb> ie . $(this).hasClass("checkbox-pointer")
[00:19:18] <loopyduck> nail_, that should work, thank you!
[00:19:22] <Cork> jnylen: $(event.target).attr('for')
[00:19:41] <wwalser> yeah, check the for attr
[00:19:52] <jnylen> check it against the id attr of the checkbox right?
[00:19:52] <dannyzb> Cork -> I noticed that makes for less-readable code
[00:20:07] <jnylen> and, what if the event target is, say, a span inside the label??
[00:20:25] <dannyzb> jnylen: jquery passes click events to parents
[00:20:27] <blackspotwiggins> target of which event?
[00:20:28] <Cork> jnylen: look for the closest
[00:20:37] <Cork> ?.closest @ jnylen
[00:20:37] <bot-t> jnylen, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:20:51] <jnylen> Cork, sounds good, thanks
[00:20:56] <blackspotwiggins> if you capture click on label, this always points to label
[00:21:04] <dannyzb> Cork : nice didn't know that one
[00:21:09] <blackspotwiggins> why make things more complicated than you have to
[00:21:50] <dannyzb> Does anyone here know a website that actually uses the themeroller plugin?
[00:22:39] <jnylen> blackspotwiggins: not necessarily capturing click on the label
[00:23:00] <dannyzb> jnylen: say again , what are you trying to achieve?
[00:23:24] <blackspotwiggins> jnylen: where are you capturing it on then?
[00:23:58] <dannyzb> sounds to me like you're complicating things
[00:24:25] <jnylen> dannyzb, blackspotwiggins: I'm writing a plugin that will allow clicking on a "row" with a specified selector to toggle a checkbox contained in the row
[00:24:45] <jnylen> labels seem to be a tricky special case if the checkbox and the label are both contained in the row
[00:24:56] <blackspotwiggins> how is it tricky
[00:25:26] <jnylen> because clicking on the label toggles the checkbox without any events
[00:25:31] <jnylen> then, the click event bubbles up to the row
[00:25:31] <blackspotwiggins> capture on row, check if target is label/input and flip it when it isnt
[00:25:32] <blackspotwiggins> done
[00:26:29] <blackspotwiggins> or add delegate that doesnt bubble in input clicks
[00:27:25] <dannyzb> $("tr.withcheckbox").click(function(){$(this).find("input[type=checkbox]").attr('checked', !$(this).attr('checked'));});
[00:27:31] <dannyzb> why wouldn't this do?
[00:27:39] <dannyzb> I'm not getting why you make it sound complicated
[00:27:47] <dannyzb> and why make a plugin for something so simple?
[00:28:06] <Cork> dannyzb: cause the event would bubble from the input box to the tr
[00:28:19] <Cork> so you would uncheck it again if its clicked directly
[00:28:41] <dannyzb> so what? $("input[type=checkbox]").click(function(e){e.stopPropagation});
[00:28:56] <dannyzb> e.stopPropagation() *
[00:29:03] <Cork> dannyzb: ya, but thats a bit nasty to do from a plugin
[00:29:11] <dannyzb> why is that nasty?
[00:29:14] <dannyzb> thats the simplest way
[00:29:15] <blackspotwiggins> dannyzb: because its more awesome if you write everything into an unmaintanable and incompatible plugin :)
[00:29:15] <Cork> as your running it on the tr, and not on the input elements
[00:29:20] <Cork> and if one is added, it would break
[00:29:34] <dannyzb> Cork: so add a class
[00:29:36] <dannyzb> no biggie
[00:29:51] <dannyzb> $("tr.clickablecheckbox").click()
[00:29:52] <Cork> dannyzb: show on earth would a class fix that problem?
[00:30:13] <dannyzb> well so I didn't get the problem
[00:30:17] <blackspotwiggins> dannyzb: $("tr.clickablecheckbox").append("<input type='checkbox'"); where is your god now?
[00:30:23] <dannyzb> lol
[00:30:24] <blackspotwiggins> +>
[00:30:27] <dannyzb> my god is fine
[00:30:30] <Cork> dannyzb: i meant for the stopPropagation
[00:30:40] <dannyzb> whats the problem with it ???
[00:30:50] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias
[00:30:50] <bot-t> Try It And See
[00:31:00] <dannyzb> I did it like a thousand times
[00:31:09] <dannyzb> I seriously can't think of a single problem with it
[00:31:29] <Cork> danheberden: $('table').myplugin(); $('table tr).eq(10).find('td').eq(2).append('<input/>')
[00:31:32] <Cork> *dannyzb
[00:32:00] <Cork> dannyzb: if the input box was added after your plugin was called, statically adding stopPropagation would fail
[00:32:40] <dannyzb> sooo
[00:32:46] <dannyzb> add it after you add the checkbox?
[00:33:11] <Cork> heh, dictating how the user of the plugin can update the table, just so you can go the simple way with the plugin
[00:33:45] <Cork> dannyzb: all you really have to do is check if the event.target is a checkbox or has a lable in its parents
[00:33:47] <Cork> its farly simple
[00:33:50] <dannyzb> $("tr").append("<td><input type="checkbox"></td>").find("input[type=checkbox]").click(function(e){e.stopPropagation})
[00:33:51] <Cork> and will constantly work
[00:33:55] <Cork> nomatter what the user does
[00:34:19] <blackspotwiggins> dannyzb: so you reinit the plugin every time you add rows?
[00:34:22] <blackspotwiggins> neat plugin, bro
[00:34:23] <dannyzb> well .. you can do that ofcourse .. but I still don't see the issue
[00:34:23] <Cork> dannyzb: but you would have to have an myplugin("update_checkbox_stopper")
[00:34:46] <Cork> dannyzb: the dynamic senario fails in your case
[00:35:00] <Cork> its fine if you write the code for your self
[00:35:05] <Cork> but not if its a plugin
[00:35:10] <dannyzb> hmm
[00:35:37] <dannyzb> You can always just check whether the DOM-element clicked was a checkbox originally there's that
[00:35:43] <Cork> plugins has to work in a way where its as robust as posible
[00:35:50] <dannyzb> still no problem there
[00:35:57] <Cork> so the user is free to use it for what it needs to do without breaking it
[00:36:14] <blackspotwiggins> dannyzb: why are you so stubborn?
[00:36:33] <blackspotwiggins> there is a supereasy solution and you are just ignoring it and trying to prove your way is better when it's not
[00:36:45] <dannyzb> blackspotwiggins: it doesn't matter how he does it , I just don't get where there's a problem
[00:36:50] <dannyzb> there are a 1000 ways to do this
[00:36:53] <blackspotwiggins> you should never write that as a plugin because it would break so often
[00:38:17] <dannyzb> it that the whole plugin?
[00:53:53] <dannyzb> who here uses jqGrid and DataTables ?
[00:57:11] <Anticom> good morning all
[01:00:05] <Anticom2> so what is meant is using $.each('.myclass', function() {$(this).autocomplete()._renderItem()}) ???
[01:00:33] <Cork> uh...
[01:00:35] <Anticom2> sorry, meant .data()
[01:00:49] <Cork> data instead of each?
[01:01:21] <dr0id> coldhead: there ?
[01:03:15] <Anticom2> no instead of .autocomplete()
[01:03:22] <dr0id> .tell coldhead hi
[01:03:23] <Anticom2> hmm firebug is telling me: $(this).data("autocomplete") is undefined
[01:03:25] <dr0id> ?tell coldhead hi
[01:03:25] <bot-t> dr0id, Okay.
[01:03:31] <dr0id> ?tell coldhead https://twitter.com/#!/hipsterhacker/status/95341659365187584 :|
[01:03:31] <bot-t> dr0id, Okay.
[01:03:58] <Cork> Anticom2: could you explain what you mean again pleas
[01:03:59] <Cork> +e
[01:07:42] <coldhead> lol dr0id
[01:08:13] <Anticom2> Corkcould you read my ticket. there my problem is explained (: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7576
[01:08:44] <Anticom2> it's about adding custom templates for the ui autocomplete
[01:09:01] <Anticom2> when using a class selector, the template will only be assigned to the first field
[01:09:03] <blackspotwiggins> Anticom2: scott answered you there
[01:09:06] <blackspotwiggins> what more do you need
[01:09:16] <Anticom2> who's scott?
[01:09:29] <blackspotwiggins> jqui team member
[01:09:33] <dr0id> coldhead: why does he have 7k followers ?
[01:09:53] <Anticom2> ah okay, but my point is, that i don't get what he means
[01:10:00] <Anticom2> that's why i'm asking you
[01:10:28] * blackspotwiggins facepalms
[01:10:36] <ajpiano> Anticom2 $(".myclass").each(function() {  $(this).data("autocomplete")._renderItem = function() { ... };   });
[01:10:41] <Anticom2> http://jsfiddle.net/wyAA8/ and this doesn't work
[01:11:17] <Anticom2> ah got it
[01:11:22] <Anticom2> thank's ajpiano
[01:12:13] <Anticom2> alright, works
[01:17:40] <NielsMob> can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/WqLK9/2/  <= i try to show a tab bar withing a table and where the <div>
[01:17:58] <NielsMob> 's are replaced by <TBody> tags
[01:18:31] <coldhead> dr0id: 7k find that kind of thing funny? it's irony, you dig
[01:18:32] <NielsMob> only the tabs are not shown in jsfiddle and i have no clue why not
[01:19:23] <ajpiano> NielsMob: i'm pretty sure jquery ui tabs doesn't support doing what you're trying to do
[01:20:01] <ajpiano> nor should it, this is bonafaide insane
[01:22:19] <NielsMob> Any suggestion on how to do it different?
[01:22:27] <ajpiano> um
[01:22:33] <ajpiano> don't use tables for layout?
[01:23:11] <ajpiano> unless you're actually trying to present tabular data in separate tabs
[01:23:19] <ajpiano> in which case you should have the normal div strucutre
[01:23:29] <ajpiano> and a seprate <table> inside each content panel
[01:24:28] <NielsMob> tried that and it was totally not looking good :(
[01:24:57] <ajpiano> well you only downgraded
[01:25:00] <ajpiano> cause this approach makes no sense
[01:25:22] <yogurt_truck> you badworsed it
[01:27:29] <muzone> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01D&raw - why do the handles extend 1px outside the width of bar? Any way to remedy this?
[01:28:06] <Cork> muzone: don'
[01:28:11] <Cork> don't dubble post
[01:28:15] <Cork> ask in one channel at a time
[01:28:41] <Anticom2> when i got a table with multiple rows containing an textarea with class "comments" how can i find the next textarea from the current class?
[01:28:51] <Anticom2> going up to tr-lvl and saying next() won't work
[01:29:12] <Cork> ?.nextAll @ Anticom2
[01:29:12] <bot-t> Anticom2, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[01:29:18] <Anticom2> thanks
[01:29:21] <dr0id> ?nextAll @ works as well
[01:29:23] <bot-t> dr0id, .next() - Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[01:29:25] <Anticom2> but got to use :first then, right?
[01:29:32] <Cork> Anticom2: next will only look at the direct following one
[01:29:38] <Cork> Anticom2: yes
[01:29:44] <Anticom2> thanks (:
[01:30:07] <muzone> Cork: Don't be a dick
[01:30:31] <Cork> muzone: i'm not, but if you want help, don't ask like that
[01:30:44] <Cork> muzone: cause among the most annoying things there is
[01:30:57] <Anticom2> doesn't work
[01:31:09] <muzone> Cork: people lik you are the most annoying things there is
[01:31:12] <Cork> muzone: is if you start to answer a question and the user don't respong cause its buzy in another channel
[01:31:14] <Anticom2> .nextAll().find('.comments') ??
[01:31:26] <Cork> muzone: if you don't want help; fine
[01:31:34] <Cork> Anticom2: write the selector in the nextAll
[01:31:35] <yogurt_truck> muzone: great way to ask for help bro
[01:31:51] <muzone> yogurt_truck: nice nickname:-)
[01:31:52] <Cork> Anticom2: .nextAll('textarea.comments:first')
[01:31:54] <Anticom2> that's what i did
[01:32:08] <Cork> Anticom2: is it really a sibling?
[01:32:17] <Anticom2> ah lol forgott the :first i was talking about (:
[01:34:07] <Anticom2> http://pastebin.com/gY9RuAkv somehow the field 'beschreibung' is always empty
[01:34:26] <Anticom2> in my php script i'm simply echoing the json_encoded array from the ajax request
[01:34:46] <Cork> Anticom2: you can't use next if the elements isn't siblings
[01:35:21] <Anticom2> Cork what do you mean with sibling?
[01:35:22] <yogurt_truck> arrghh pastebin.com makes hurts me in my eyes
[01:35:46] <Anticom2> non working scripts make my head hurt ;)
[01:36:09] <Cork> Anticom2: <a></a><div><span></span></div>
[01:36:18] <Cork> Anticom2: a is sibling with div, but not with span
[01:36:24] <Anticom2> ah okay
[01:36:38] <Anticom2> sec, i'll show you an example
[01:37:27] <Anticom2> sec, brb
[01:37:38] <NielsMob> ajpiano: thanks, need to do some other stuff ... i will talk with you when that is finished
[01:38:16] <ajpiano> i'm going to sleep, good luck NielsMob
[01:39:19] <muzone> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01D&raw - why do the handles extend 1px outside the width of bar? Any way to remedy this?
[01:40:23] <Cork> muzone: the slider is positioned with left: %
[01:40:33] <Cork> sorry the handle
[01:40:47] <shellox> hi
[01:41:03] <Cork> muzone: that means that 50% of the sliders width will be outside the slider
[01:41:21] <Cork> muzone: just add a negative margin on the left
[01:44:39] <bjhaid1> hi, I am using the jquery ui dialog and I want the buttons to be on the right and not on the left, how do i get this done
[01:45:03] <shellox> http://dpaste.com/577117/
[01:45:24] <shellox> i need some help with this
[01:45:27] <muzone> Cork: thanks man
[01:45:43] <shellox> i want to create a input field on button click
[01:46:36] <Anticom2> http://jsfiddle.net/wvF4A/ alright, that's a shorten example of what i mean
[01:46:56] <muzone> Cork: negative margin to the left of .ui-slider-handle? It's already got -9px
[01:47:12] <shellox> "<input type="text" name=\"test'document.write(x);'\"/>"
[01:47:19] <Anticom2> i'm at the edit-button in the tr, where it's saying "testeintrag"
[01:47:37] <Anticom2> and now i want to navigate down to the textarea in tr with class editDetail
[01:47:45] <shellox> Anticom2: ah, another german ;)
[01:47:52] <Anticom2> yup :P
[01:48:19] <Anticom2> if you need help with translating something, feel free to query me shellox
[01:48:57] <muzone> Cork: And then if the width of the sidebar changes, the 50 will be something entirely different won't it?
[01:50:08] <Cork> muzone: well thats how it works
[01:50:33] <muzone> Would be cool with a solid pixel way of setting it
[01:50:46] <muzone> So it'll work at any zoom level or whatever
[01:50:46] <Cork> there was in the old slider
[01:50:57] <muzone> I see
[01:51:05] <Cork> but it was quite buggy
[01:52:34] <shellox> im looking for sth. like this  <input type="text" name="document.write(x);">
[01:53:00] <shellox> how to do this?
[01:53:21] <shellox> var x should be the content of the name element
[01:54:34] <Cork> shellox: from js?
[01:54:51] <Cork> just set the name attribute
[01:55:04] <Anticom2> i don't get it... so you want to insert the value from the input field as name attribute?
[01:57:50] <shellox> nope, i create input fields dynamic with a button click event. So, I want a counter, name it x, and it should increased by 1 if the button get clicked. so the first field should look like this: <input type="text" name="test1"/>, the second <input type="text" name="text2"/> etc.
[01:58:32] <Cork> shellox: $('<input type="text"/>').attr('name', 'test' + x);

[01:59:28] <hurdos> Good evening!
[02:00:13] <hurdos> I faced a problem with a color of text inside <td> for the theme UI darkness.
[02:01:04] <hurdos> If text inside <td>, the color of text is black like background and text is not visible.
[02:01:17] <hurdos> Does anybody know a solution?
[02:03:22] <shellox> Cork: thanks, works fine now ;)
[02:15:57] <Samuel_H> Hell everyone
[02:17:11] <hurdos> Samuel_H: Hi there
[02:17:22] <Samuel_H> oh well its big lol go do your stuff bro lol?
[02:17:33] <Samuel_H> srry pushed up key lol
[02:17:41] <Samuel_H> Mind helpin me out hurdos ?
[02:19:26] <quicksilver> Samuel_H: no one can help you until you ask a question.
[02:19:45] <Adman65> is there a quick way to select the first N number of elements in a list
[02:20:22] <Samuel_H> lol well I want to give a few css elements a close button and when they close it sends in to the database to hideit for good kinda like how facebook does
[02:20:26] <quicksilver> Adman65: :lt(N)
[02:20:45] <quicksilver> Adman65: or N+1 or N-1 I can't remember.
[02:20:57] <Adman65> k
[02:20:59] <Adman65> cheers
[02:21:25] <quicksilver> Samuel_H: that's not really a question, more a specification for a programming project. You'll need to use javascript, AJAX, and appropriate server-side code.
[02:22:08] <mazzachre> How can I make sure jquerymobile is initialized? I have a function that I run in document ready, it updates a list, but I get an error that listview refresh is not yet initialized.

[02:33:04] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> Q: I've got a issue on IE7. I have a div container that is visible when a give element (its parent) as mouseover, I expect that it keeps visible till the mouseleaves/out, the thing is, when clicking inside the container it hiddes (like it would when over). I'm trying javascript to substitute this behaviour, but since Q: I've got a issue on IE7. I have a div container that is visible when
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> a given element (its parent) as mouseover, let's call this #showhide, I expect
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> that it keeps visible till the mouseout, the thing is, when clicking inside
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> #showhide it hiddes (like it would when over). I'm trying javascript to
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> substitute this behaviour, but mouse over child elements of $showhide will trigger
[02:36:47] <Shwaiil> mouseout and #showhide is hidden. How to solve ?
[02:37:41] <Shwaiil> I expect that mouseout or mouseleave on #showhide, understands that child elements are still #showhide, like > ie7 and FF understands
[02:45:46] <purefusion2> how would I grab an element by selector from within another already jQuerified element's variable? (hope that makes sense)
[02:46:13] <matjas> purefusion2: .find()
[02:46:23] <purefusion2> yeah, I was thinking it might be that
[02:46:43] <matjas> $someEl.find('.foo') or use context, e.g. $('.foo', $someEl)
[02:46:59] <purefusion2> ah, context looks interesting
[02:47:38] <mazzachre> did jquerymobile die in infancy?
[02:48:48] <matjas> how can I get two datepickers working together using jQuery UI? e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/wkZT6/
[03:04:33] <purefusion2> $(function(){...}); is jQuery's alternate approach to running script on load, correct?
[03:08:38] <Shwaiil> purefusion, thats an anonymous function ?!
[03:18:28] <juria_roberts> var a = $("[name^='slide']");
[03:18:29] <juria_roberts> a[0].attr("class");
[03:18:41] <juria_roberts> why cannot i get class of the element?
[03:18:53] <juria_roberts> what am i doing wrong?
[03:19:07] <juria_roberts> all i want is the the value of the class
[03:20:17] <quicksilver> juria_roberts: .attr is a jQuery method
[03:20:24] <quicksilver> juria_roberts: a[0] is not a jQuery object.
[03:20:54] <juria_roberts> quicksilver: but i assigned jquery objects to it
[03:20:54] <quicksilver> you can either use a.attr('class') or a[0].className
[03:21:03] <quicksilver> juria_roberts: a is a jquery object. a[0] is not.
[03:21:18] <quicksilver> purefusion2: yes.
[03:21:26] <juria_roberts> quicksilver: why does it work like that?
[03:22:02] <quicksilver> juria_roberts: jQuery methods (like your selector search) return jQuery objects. a jQuery object is an array of DOM objects with some (lots) of extra methods available.
[03:22:18] <quicksilver> if you dereference the array, like [0], you get the underlying DOM object
[03:22:18] <juria_roberts> quicksilver: ohh thanks
[03:22:33] <purefusion2> quicksilver: thanks, and it will run the code even if that script is run after the page has been loaded a while, right?
[03:24:05] <quicksilver> purefusion2: "If .ready() is called after the DOM has been initialized, the new handler passed in will be executed immediately."
[03:24:11] <quicksilver> (i.e. Yes)
[03:24:51] <rubknob> is $(function () {}); the same as $(document).ready(function(){});
[03:25:20] <quicksilver> yes.
[03:46:13] <stenno1> good day, how can i do the following: cut an element from the dom and insert it somewhere else? for example if i have <a></a><b></b>, what would be the method to make it <b><a></a></b> ?
[03:46:26] <Woet> stenno1: what are you trying to achieve?
[03:47:13] <stenno1> i want a video element to be moved to another position in the dom
[03:47:21] <stenno1> on certain events
[03:47:32] <stenno1> hmm or  wait
[03:47:33] <Woet> well
[03:47:46] <stenno1> maybe i can just use css for that...
[03:47:49] <Woet> yes
[03:47:52] <Woet> that would be a better way
[03:48:05] <stenno1> alright thanks :)
[03:48:09] <Woet> but if you insist: var HTML = $("#original_location").html(); $("#original_location").html(''); $("#new_location").html(HTML);
[03:48:20] <Woet> good luck
[03:48:31] <stenno1> :)
[03:49:33] <|RicharD|> Why with:       $("input[type=text], input[type=password]").focus(function() {
[03:49:49] <|RicharD|> it not work with input with type password ?
[03:54:18] <rubknob> using the validate() plugin, is there a built-in method to compare dates so if date2 < date1, invalidate the form?
[03:57:03] <rubknob> found what I was looking for here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/833997/end-date-greater-than-start-date-jquery-validation

[04:13:39] <koichirose> not properly a jquery question - If I have the array ["aaa", "bbb"] and the string "ccc", how do I create the following string? 'aaaccc,bbbccc'
[04:17:31] <Suresh> Hi guys, can anybody tell where is the registration page for jquery?
[04:17:41] <Cork> koichirose: var str = "ccc"; $.map(["aaa", "bbb"], function(val) { return val + str; }).join(',')
[04:18:15] <Cork> Suresh: you mean for the forum?
[04:18:16] <borkweb> Or without jQuery:     var string = 'ccc'; var bork = ['aaa', 'bbb'];  bork = bork.join( string + ',' ) + string;
[04:18:33] <Suresh> I want to place my site into the "Sites Using JQuery"
[04:18:38] <Suresh> not forum
[04:18:45] <koichirose> Cork, I tried with $(myarray).map(function.... with no luck. will try borkweb's though.
[04:19:00] <Cork> koichirose: you can't use $() on an array
[04:19:10] <Suresh> it says to login, but not able to find the Signup/Registration form
[04:19:18] <Cork> koichirose: use $.map(myarray, function() {});
[04:19:37] <koichirose> Cork, got it, thanks
[04:20:05] <BlaDe^> Hi guys..... I have an issue with autocomplete working in chrome but not firefox
[04:20:28] <BlaDe^> I have a blank input, then I copy a value to it like this:	$('.maininput, #test_input').unbind().val(string.replace(/&/g, "&amp;").replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;"));
[04:20:48] <BlaDe^> chrome remembers that value on the next page load and shows it as an autocompete option (note autocomplete="on" in the markup) but firefox doesn't... Does anyone have any suggestions?
[04:20:58] <Suresh> Cork: not forum, regular jquery site
[04:21:37] <chemic> Hi. I have a <tr> with links in it. I want the links to be individually clickable, but also make the entire row clickable. I did this http://pastie.org/2267838 which basically works, but the e.stopPropagation(); breaks things if the link has its own click handlers installed (as is the case for that last link in the row). a) do you understand what I intend, and b) can you help me achieve it please?
[04:22:14] <Cork> Suresh: i saw you the first time; but i have no idea
[04:24:14] <Suresh> Corck: please the post in the forum http://forum.jquery.com/topic/sites-using-jquery-page#14737000002576657
[04:29:16] <dinosaadeh> hi guys i am trying to have a list of photos with jscrollpane and zoomer, anyone can advise what i can use? the scroller will show me 4 images one after the other as the user scrolls and once the mouse hovers over the image, it magnifies it
[04:30:46] <chemic> Can anyone help? I guess what I need is to stop propogation of a click if and only if it has no other click handlers associated with it.
[04:31:31] <Cork> chemic: http://jsfiddle.net/7HL3C/
[04:31:43] <Cork> opps
[04:31:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7HL3C/1/
[04:31:58] <Cork> and that ones correct too :=
[04:33:00] <chemic> Cork!
[04:33:08] <chemic> Cork!! That might just work!
[04:38:02] <pr0ton> hi had a question about jgrowl
[04:38:14] <pr0ton> is it possible to position it on the top right of a div?
[04:38:19] <pr0ton> specifically i want to do it on a mpa
[04:39:31] <chemic> Cork: I dont think it does work :( The data-delete link clicks dont seem to register at all.
[04:41:52] <kingmilo> Hi all.
[04:42:59] <kingmilo> I understand jQuery - Grid is probably going to be released towards the end of Aug. Is there is something within the jQuery UI that I could use in the meantime to sort information pulled from db, or should I just implement a standard table.
[04:44:30] <Shwaiil> Q: Let's say I've bing to <SELECT > on event change a function where I want to know the value of SELECT > OPTION. How to do that ?  currentTarget is not working here.  Thanks!
[04:45:49] <adbe> Shwaiil: $(':selected', this) ?
[04:46:30] <Shwaiil> adbe, tks for looking. I'll try it ;)
[04:46:59] <muzone> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01G&raw - any way to make the handles not extend past the width of the bar?
[04:48:08] <coldhead> i can't go on without you tempsy
[04:48:18] <temhawk> hello, I have a question about iframes... I can select an iframe with document.getElementById("theframe") and then do for e.g. .contentWindow.location.href = "#"; after it, but that doesn't work when I select it with jQuery like so: $(this).parent().siblings("iframe") (where "this" is a <li> inside a <ul> next to the iframe) even though in console it seems that I have the iframe selected!
[04:49:10] <hrwath> Shwaiil, I'd say $(this).val()
[04:49:28] <chemic> Cork: Ah sweet, got it now I think. Problem was the case of the 'a'.
[04:50:07] <temhawk> btw my question is: why is that so, and how could I select it with jQuery (or do I have to use regular JS, and why?)?
[04:51:05] <misterm> temhawk: when you use jQuery to select an element, what you get back is a jQuery object
[04:51:15] <hrwath> bot-t, hello!
[04:51:18] <bot-t> hrwath, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[04:51:24] <hrwath> thanks
[04:52:20] <misterm> temhawk: to get at the actual element, you'd do something like $(selector).get(0)
[04:52:23] <temhawk> misterm: ok.. is it not possible to convert the jQuery object to the HTML?
[04:52:54] <misterm> temhawk: well I don't think what you want is to convert it to HTML, or at least thats not what your question seems to be about
[04:53:10] <kingmilo> I understand jQuery - Grid is probably going to be released towards the end of Aug. Is there is something within the jQuery UI that I could use in the meantime to sort information pulled from db, or should I just implement a standard table.
[04:53:29] <temhawk> misterm: well I want to use jQuery instead of "document.getElementById()" if possible
[04:53:36] <temhawk> misterm: isn't get() for Ajax?
[04:53:47] <muzone> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01G&raw - any way to make the handles not extend past the width of the bar?
[04:54:30] <temhawk> muzone: the handles don't do that for me
[04:54:40] <temhawk> muzone: tried a different browser?
[04:54:40] <misterm> temhawk: yea, that's what I'm saying....$(selector) returns a jQuery object...which holds the dom element(s) you want
[04:55:11] <misterm> temhawk: the jQuery object itself doesn't have properties like "contentwindow" etc...those are properties of the dom elements...so you need to get at the dom element itself
[04:55:11] <dmarkey> anyone used cluetip here? whats the best ajaxy tooltip lib
[04:55:16] <misterm> temhawk: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[04:55:31] <fraserkillip> hey, easy question: I have this selector $("#input_form input:file"); which returns two input fields, if i do this $("#input_form input:file").clone(); it clones the first but if i do array = $("#input_form input:file"); array[0].clone(); it says clone() is not a valid function, what am i doing wrong?
[04:55:55] <misterm> temhawk: the get you are thinking of is $.get(), which is different than $(selector).get()
[04:56:28] <temhawk> misterm: oh! ok, confusing, I see now
[04:57:01] <muzone> temhawk: you sure you can see the difference?
[04:57:46] <misterm> fraserkillip: your problem is like the opposite of temhawks, lol
[04:57:48] <temhawk> misterm: thank you very much!
[04:58:04] <misterm> fraserkillip: when you do $(selector)[0] you get back the dom element, not a jQuery object
[04:59:47] <temhawk> muzone: y it works perfectly for me, maximum range i can do is 0-500, and the sliders are exactly on the edges there
[05:01:11] <fraserkillip> misterm: how would i get the jQuery object of that element
[05:01:49] <temhawk> muzone: tested it in Safari 5, Firefox 5, Opera 11, everywhere it's perfect..
[05:02:09] <misterm> fraserkillip: something like $(selector).eq(0)
[05:02:37] <muzone> nah
[05:02:38] <muzone> wait
[05:03:03] <muzone> i mean thanks for testing - but there is a tiny gap
[05:03:14] <muzone> http://home.no/mritz/price.png
[05:04:12] <kevincampion> hi
[05:04:22] <fraserkillip> misterm: i need to store an array of objects so if i did array.eq(0) would that work?
[05:04:25] <temhawk> muzone: not for me
[05:04:51] <muzone> temhawk: got a screenshot?
[05:05:36] <muzone> (of when the handles are not at their edges)
[05:06:27] <kevincampion> how I could know that $('span#myspan') is hidden without use .parent() with <div id="mydiv" style="display:none;"><span id="myspan">hello</span></div>
[05:08:56] <temhawk> muzone: http://bit.ly/n9H47G | http://bit.ly/qb9g0S
[05:12:43] <User276> hellol
[05:12:44] <misterm> kevincampion: something like $("span#myspan").is(":visible")
[05:13:04] <User276> anyone know how to delay an if statement
[05:13:51] <misterm> User276: what do you mean?
[05:14:16] <kevincampion> misterm: perfect, thx
[05:14:21] <User276> as if have it sleep beffore going to an if statement
[05:14:27] <User276> in*
[05:14:49] <error4o4> building a simpel accordion: http://jsfiddle.net/dakJL/   any idea how to hide the open element when opening a new one. not sure how to know which one is currently open
[05:15:19] <misterm> User276: you can use setTimeout or setInterval to execute code after a delay, or at set intervals respectively
[05:17:41] <muzone> temhawk: http://home.no/mriz/price.png - you was wrong and i was right, baby girl no need to put up a fight
[05:18:28] <temhawk> whatever lol
[05:18:45] <fraserkillip> i have a jquery object of elements from a standard selector, how do i remove the first one shift() does not work
[05:18:59] <muzone> the upload failed, please hold
[05:19:53] <onr> fraserkillip: recreate object without first one
[05:20:05] <muzone> temhawk: http://home.no/mritz/price.png
[05:20:09] <fraserkillip> onr: how?
[05:20:17] <DukeDrake> hi
[05:20:44] <onr> fraserkillip: how? just exclude first one
[05:20:56] <misterm> fraserkillip: try something like  $(selector).slice(1)
[05:20:56] <muzone> temhawk: you see that????
[05:20:57] <vepsen_> error4o4: http://jsfiddle.net/dakJL/1/
[05:21:03] <DukeDrake> I try  $('#myul li').each(function(index){ alert(index); }); , but alert says 'undefined' ... what's wrong?
[05:21:07] <temhawk> muzone: did you see my screenshots?
[05:21:24] <muzone> yes
[05:21:36] <muzone> those ARE your screenshots
[05:21:55] <temhawk> muzone: when the sliders are at 0-500 they are at the edges as i assume is desired, when they are at 15-500 the left one is a little bit inset, also desired assume, so what is the problem?
[05:22:11] <Aquaguy> is there any way to move an element withing it's parent? I mean place it before one of its siblings. (without destroying and creating it, it has some events attached to it and If I remove the element and then place it before/after the desired element the event handlers are gone, that's why I want to move it instead of removing, is it possible?)
[05:22:23] <DukeDrake> ok, works now
[05:22:52] <muzone> temhawk: well, i'd like the bar to extend all the way to the left and right
[05:23:13] <temhawk> muzone: trolling you are?
[05:23:15] <error4o4> vepsen: looks good :)  thanks  btw what is 'running' used for, its state is never changeing
[05:23:43] <User276> i tried setTimeout and it didn't work
[05:24:12] <User276> i did
[05:24:13] <User276> setTimeout($('#layer2').html('<p>false</p>'),5000);
[05:24:20] <vepsen> error: just unfinished, it does not handle clicking on an open item either
[05:24:32] <muzone> temhawk: Yeah, accuse me for trolling because your eyes can't see the damn problem!
[05:24:35] <muzone> that is pathetic
[05:24:35] <User276> it still sets it instantly
[05:25:08] <muzone> http://home.no/mritz/price2.png is what im hoping to achieve
[05:25:12] <error4o4> vepsen: ok i see, thanks
[05:25:18] <sadmicrowave> User276, setTimeout(function(){ $('#layer2').html('<p>false</p>'); }, 5000 );
[05:25:24] <sadmicrowave> wrap it in a function
[05:25:48] <temhawk> muzone: sorry but it makes perfect sense to me that the left handle of the slider would be a little more to the right if the starting point of the range should be increased a little.
[05:26:10] <fraserkillip> misterm: slice(1) worked, thanks :)
[05:27:10] <stenno1> Woet, i realized if you have the markup <a></a><b></b> you can do $("b").insert("a") to get <b><a></a></b>, the <a> is cut from the dom
[05:27:40] <sadmicrowave> Aquaguy, if you use .detach() on the element, then .prepend() it into the parent element all the event handlers are maintained without having to recreate them
[05:28:15] <sadmicrowave> Aquaguy, .detach() is like .remove() except that it keeps the element stored in memory, like cut and paste does
[05:28:51] <stenno1> Woet, s/insert/append
[05:29:09] <misterm> fraserkillip: np
[05:31:37] <muzone> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01J&raw - is there any way to fix the 1px gap at http://home.no/mritz/price.png at either side so it becomes like this? http://home.no/mritz/price2.png
[05:31:56] <User276> thx it worked
[05:32:08] <User276> also is it possible to detect where the page is navigating to ?
[05:32:15] <KuW8t> can someone take a look on my script here: http://stallions-esport.eu ? you have to scroll down. and klick the link. it starts a ajax query. i dont know why but the result will returned two times. this should not be happen!
[05:32:25] <airman00> Hello all. For the   $('#target').click(function(event) {  , is there some way to handle all click functions, and then run a subroutine based on the targets name? For example: instead of doing  $('#map').click(function(event){  Expand("map"); } ,  does something exist where I can do  click(function(event) {  var target = name of target clicked; Expand(target); }  ?
[05:32:35] <sadmicrowave> User276, what do you mean?
[05:33:21] <krz> whats a good jquery calender plugin?
[05:33:23] <pngl> Is it possible to have jQuery work without adding sizcache attributes to DOM elements? This behaviour breaks some of my code which (legitimately I believe) expects the DOM not to change in specific situations.
[05:34:42] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, why do you have 2 $(document).ready()'s in using-yql.js?
[05:35:15] <Dirkos> Guys i have this class on which im working on at the moment: http://jsfiddle.net/TGK3p/. But how come that if i select multiple values, only 1 value is appended to the other element
[05:35:45] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: it was like this in the tutorial
[05:35:58] <sadmicrowave> get rid of the first one with .load in nit
[05:36:04] <sadmicrowave> in it*...just comment it out for now
[05:36:16] <temhawk> error4o4: you can add this line at the top of the .click() response (above .next().toggle() line): jQuery(this).siblings("h1").next().hide();
[05:36:22] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, then try again
[05:36:52] <KuW8t> i did it and it changed nothin
[05:37:00] <KuW8t> i also thought it was a problem
[05:37:02] <KuW8t> but it dont
[05:37:28] <sadmicrowave> why do I still see it in the script?
[05:38:00] <error4o4> temhawk: thanks, another way to do it
[05:38:13] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: ok its commented out
[05:38:19] <User276>  is it possible to grab the url the page is navigating to ?
[05:38:22] <KuW8t> same problem
[05:38:37] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, good, well at least we are narrowing it down
[05:38:51] <misterm> User276: what do you mean "grab" and what do you mean "navigating to"
[05:38:53] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, the fact that 'it changes nothing' should tell you that you don't need it in your code
[05:38:54] <Av007> http://jsfiddle.net/Av007/RWjkN/27/    can't select preview button((((
[05:39:07] <User276> as in u click a link which takes u to a diffrent page
[05:39:13] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: yes you r right
[05:39:42] <Dirkos> Av007: remove the """ in the listener
[05:39:59] <misterm> User276: you can listen for clicks on links and get the URL of the link
[05:40:02] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: but there is also a strange cellpadding value on the table that is load with ajax that should not be there..
[05:40:03] <Dirkos> $('a[name=preview_comment]')
[05:40:20] <Av007> ohh... ok
[05:40:25] <Av007> thanks!
[05:40:27] <User276> any ideas ?
[05:40:29] <misterm> User276: doing something useful with it before the page unloads, depends on what you want to do
[05:40:37] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, where do you format the table? server-side?
[05:40:42] <User276> yea i want to get the url on unload
[05:40:56] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: in my standalone version everything is ok... look: http://stallions-esport.eu/testarea/using-yql.html
[05:41:02] <Dirkos> Guys i have this class on which im working on at the moment: http://jsfiddle.net/TGK3p/. But how come that if i select multiple values, only 1 value is appended to the other element
[05:41:32] <KuW8t> i format it server side and only over my css..
[05:41:42] <misterm> User276: my first shot would be doing what I just suggested, listening for clicks on links/whatnot, and getting the URL of that click, then doing whatever
[05:42:13] <User276> well that part is tricky because the link is in a iframe
[05:42:28] <temhawk> User276: $("a").click(function(e){ var destination = this.href; }); or something
[05:42:41] <User276> yea but the link is in a iframe
[05:42:45] <temhawk> no need for the "e" actually
[05:42:50] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: you see in my test version everythin is fine.. that must be overriden by the other script or css
[05:43:07] <KuW8t> the panel slide script
[05:43:08] <misterm> User276: do you control the site in the iframe?
[05:43:15] <temhawk> User276: so you want your host window to detect change in the iframe?
[05:43:24] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, yea I'm looking at it now, trying to find a discrepancy between the two sites
[05:43:34] <User276> no i don't control the site in the iframe
[05:44:12] <misterm> User276: do you know where the links might lead?
[05:44:27] <temhawk> User276: if the iframe is loaded from a different server then you can't access its DOM, add events, etc.
[05:44:28] <User276> it it somewhat like
[05:44:33] <misterm> User276: i.e., are they on the same domain as the initial domain?
[05:45:14] <User276> my site > loads ofsitescript > outputs links
[05:45:19] <misterm> User276: if the iframe is not your content, you shouldn't be listening to it really
[05:45:35] <misterm> User276: plus you'll hit loads of security restrictions
[05:45:52] <clt> Hi, anybody knows some cool jquery plugin for fullscreen gallery on the background (something like http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/ - it looks good, but download doesn't work)
[05:46:25] <User276> well its an ad
[05:46:28] <User276> so its impossible ?
[05:47:41] <Dirkos> Guys i have this class on which im working on at the moment: http://jsfiddle.net/TGK3p/. But how come that if i select multiple values, only 1 value is appended to the other element
[05:48:15] <User276> are u guys still ther ?
[05:48:32] <misterm> User276: well it's something you shouldn't be doing most likely
[05:48:35] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, does it duplicate the data if you take out the FilterData function? try commenting out the call to that function and see what it does
[05:48:42] <User276> no
[05:48:54] <User276> its an ad on my page why sholdn't i track my statistics
[05:48:55] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: ok i try
[05:49:42] <misterm> User276: if it's an ad, the ad network should provide you statistics
[05:50:08] <User276> but i need an even to happen based on the ad clicked
[05:50:15] <Wiz_KeeD_> how can i make a script that would change the src of an image when the script is running
[05:50:30] <Wiz_KeeD_> something like $('#blabla').function() { xxx }
[05:50:36] <Wiz_KeeD_> clearly that doesn't work
[05:50:40] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: but in my tesarea the filter function is also active
[05:50:59] <sadmicrowave> i know, I'm just trying different stuff
[05:51:06] <temhawk> User276: it's impossible if the iframe content is from a different server and the ad service hasn't explicitly implemented a way for it to communicate with your host page
[05:51:07] <taar779> hey I've searched online for this but haven't come up with anything but is there a way to find the key of an assoc array?
[05:51:09] <User276> so is it possible or not ?
[05:51:25] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, since I can't see anything is blatantly wrong with it
[05:51:31] <misterm> User276: your overall goal is probably possible
[05:51:50] <User276> Any ideas how to do it ?
[05:51:53] <misterm> User276: but in terms of the straight-forward way we just talked about, no
[05:52:09] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: strange or not?
[05:52:25] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, does it work without the filderdata?
[05:52:28] <sadmicrowave> filterdata*
[05:52:44] <temhawk> User276: i read this recently: http://softwareas.com/cross-domain-communication-with-iframes and it says several methods of communicating between frames, but all of them require cooperation from the other server..
[05:52:49] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: i need the filterdata!
[05:52:58] <KuW8t> it works in my testares with it yes
[05:53:08] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: it works in my testares with it yes
[05:53:25] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, ok, my question is, does it still duplicate data on the real site when you take filterData out?
[05:53:45] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: i will test it , one moment
[05:54:22] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, I'm just trying to isolate the problem right now, once we figure out where it is coming from we will know where to look and figure out how to fix it.
[05:54:38] <User276> any ideas ?
[05:54:48] <temhawk> User276: it's not possible
[05:55:05] <temhawk> User276: it's a security thing
[05:55:23] <drecute> hello
[05:55:23] <dmarkey> Whats everyones preference for a tooltip plugin with ajax
[05:55:33] <User276> how
[05:55:43] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: yes then it is shown only one time
[05:55:48] <User276> if u can detect unload it should be able to detect the next loc
[05:55:49] <User276> x.x
[05:55:52] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, this is troubleshooting 101, start commenting things out and keep re-testing your page after every comment.  Eventually, your page will work as desired and your problem will be found in the last commented area
[05:56:12] <temhawk> User276: frames can not read or write anything in each other's DOM, except write location.href
[05:56:15] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, great! so now we know the problem is in the filterData function.  Lets take a look at that more closely
[05:56:32] <drecute> i need help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[05:56:39] <User276> all i want is the location.href x.x
[05:56:43] <temhawk> User276: the frame's content can detect its own unload, and your host page can detect its, but neither can detect it of the other
[05:56:51] <drecute> it is prettyDate plugin
[05:57:00] <drecute> and I'm getting frustrated with it
[05:57:03] <User276> hm
[05:57:13] <drecute> more than 12 hours on it now
[05:57:24] <User276> wait
[05:57:37] <temhawk> User276: obviously you can't add event listeners to the other frame's DOM unless there is a mechanism in place (only works if the other server has put the necessary code there which is probably not the case)
[05:57:57] <User276> ugh was gonna ask that lol
[05:58:06] <User276> ok another idea
[05:58:20] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, alright, uncomment your call to filterData() so it fires again, but comment out the line with .closest('table').clone() and see if it works
[05:58:24] <User276> what about detect the statusbar on unload
[05:58:29] <drecute> has anyone use prettyDate plugin recently?
[05:58:31] <User276> that should have the link right ?
[05:59:31] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: works
[05:59:50] <temhawk> User276: you can't detect unload from the frame... but i guess you could continuously poll the status bar contents to see what the user hovers over, is definitely not recommended!
[05:59:59] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, alright, so is there any real reason to have that .clone() line in there?
[06:00:07] <User276> wel temhawk
[06:00:09] <drecute> can someone help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[06:00:14] <User276> the links in the iframe
[06:00:23] <User276> changes the whole windows location
[06:00:29] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: yes its a main feature
[06:00:46] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: or whait
[06:00:57] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: the clone() perhaps not
[06:01:00] <User276> so it will also unload the parent
[06:01:14] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, comment it out and let me know so I can refresh my page
[06:01:28] <temhawk> User276: hmm. but i don't think the unload event gives any information about the next request
[06:01:40] <User276> no but
[06:01:48] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: i delet only the .clone(); and now it works
[06:02:03] <User276> the status bar should change to the link right ?
[06:02:15] <User276> as long as the mouse is over the link
[06:02:24] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: but why it works also in my testarea ... strange.. there is no duplicate output
[06:03:54] <temhawk> User276: yeah, but i think it will be useless at the moment the unload event fires, test it though
[06:04:17] <User276> in that case
[06:04:44] <User276> i could get the status on mouse up
[06:04:47] <User276> and check it on unload
[06:04:51] <maciej> What is the best way to attach a function such as .datepicker() on a selector in a 'live' fashion?
[06:04:53] <User276> :o would that work ?
[06:06:03] <temhawk> User276: the status bar doesn't have a property about its contents, so you can forget that
[06:06:12] <User276> wrong O.o
[06:06:26] <User276> when u hover over a link the statusbar changes to the url
[06:06:56] <Woet> User276: what are you trying to do?
[06:07:34] <User276> get the url of the link clicked before it navigates to the next page
[06:07:46] <Woet> and where should that URL be submitted to?
[06:07:46] <User276> i'm thinking of
[06:08:32] <Woet> also, User276, go back further
[06:08:36] <Woet> what are you trying to achieve?
[06:08:44] <User276> to window.opener
[06:08:48] <User276> but anyway
[06:08:53] <User276> i'm thinking of doing this
[06:08:57] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, let me look at that
[06:09:14] <Woet> ?ask @ User276
[06:09:15] <bot-t> User276, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:09:19] <drecute> can someone help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[06:09:26] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: u dont have the link anymore?
[06:09:33] <Woet> Describe the goal, not the step
[06:09:34] <sadmicrowave> yea
[06:09:40] <User276> on mouse up get status > on unload check status > if status continas a vertain link set a var in the opener to true
[06:10:02] <User276> would that work ?
[06:10:21] <Woet> User276: Describe the goal, not the step
[06:10:22] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave:  link is in your query
[06:10:41] <User276> i just told u the goal...
[06:10:50] <User276> get the navigating url ...
[06:10:58] <Woet> User276: no, that's a step
[06:11:03] <Woet> why do you need the navigating URL?
[06:11:21] <User276> ....why are we going through this again
[06:11:27] <temhawk> User276: you can't read what is in the status bar
[06:11:29] <Woet> because you've never been there
[06:11:44] <User276> i can't :s ?
[06:11:48] * Woet sighs
[06:11:51] <temhawk> User276: the only thing that you can get about the status bar is visibility
[06:11:56] <KuW8t> but i also have now porblems with the css fomration on this table, and i found out that my doctype is making problems. and the <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
[06:12:05] <User276> ugh there goes that idea x.x
[06:12:12] <User276> woet
[06:12:13] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: but i also have now porblems with the css fomration on this table, and i found out that my doctype is making problems. and the <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
[06:12:20] <User276> i'm am getting the ad clicked on my site
[06:12:26] <sadmicrowave> let me look at this first
[06:12:51] <Woet> User276: someone is clicking an ad and you want to know which one they clicked?
[06:12:59] <User276> correct
[06:13:09] <Woet> User276: and who is providing that ad? google adsense?
[06:13:17] <misterm> Woet: User276 is trying to detect what they are clicking in an iframe from another domain
[06:13:33] <User276> an ad company
[06:13:43] <User276> the script which outputs the add is on there domain
[06:14:06] <Woet> User276: okay, and why do you want to know what they are clicking? statistics?
[06:14:20] <User276> yes
[06:15:08] <temhawk> User276: i think the ad service should give you statistics
[06:15:11] <Woet> as far as I know, nearly all ad companies forbid you from tracking that
[06:15:13] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, I'm comparing the scripts hold on
[06:15:15] <misterm> We've been down this road
[06:15:26] <KuW8t> sadmicrowave: k
[06:15:31] <misterm> User276 want to check what they're clicking because they want to do "an action"
[06:16:04] <misterm> I'm guessing they have some sort of "click the ad, then the video will play" sort of deal or something?
[06:16:16] <User276> yes
[06:16:25] <Woet> User276: forbidden by all ad companies.
[06:16:45] <User276> woet
[06:17:08] <User276> your whole disscusion has not been productive its just been on proving how not to do it
[06:17:11] <Woet> okay.
[06:17:27] <User276> if you don't how please jsut say so
[06:17:31] <Woet> oh, i know how
[06:17:40] <Woet> but i'm not going to help you ruin the clicks of companies investing in advertising
[06:17:56] <Woet> and intentionally breach the terms of service of the ad company
[06:17:57] <Woet> so good luck
[06:18:00] <User276> i want to get the statatics of which ads are clicked
[06:18:10] <User276> since in my ad panal
[06:18:16] <User276> i can chose which ads to display
[06:18:41] <User276> that way to can choose ads relevant to the person viewing my sites intrest
[06:18:46] <User276> google does it with gmail
[06:18:46] <misterm> User276: and your ad network is not giving you those statistics?
[06:18:57] <User276> and survey comapnys display this staitics as weel
[06:18:58] <temhawk> User276: i suggest you contact your ad service and tell them what you want
[06:19:04] <User276> so why do u think i'm doing something malcious ?
[06:19:36] <misterm> User276: if you want statistics on what ads are getting clicked, the natural and easiest thing to do is just go to the ad network
[06:19:57] <misterm> User276: if they're not giving you those/you don't trust them....you should find a new ad network
[06:19:57] <User276> ...can we focus on the coding aspect
[06:20:07] <User276> i told u the ad site only displays that a link has been clicked
[06:20:52] <misterm> User276: well let me put it this way, if I were to answer your question it would provide more effort than I think most people are willing to give over IRC for free
[06:20:55] <temhawk> User276: there is no coding aspect, really. it would all be hacks and stuff.
[06:21:09] <User276> how would it be hacks ...
[06:21:18] <User276> what are u talking about temhawk O.o ?
[06:21:33] <misterm> User276: this is a channel for jQuery, where people generously donate their time to help people who are stuck with jQuery by pushing them in the right direction
[06:21:34] <temhawk> User276: it's not meant to be possible
[06:21:45] <noob> hi guys
[06:22:02] <User276> misterm i did come for jquery help
[06:22:02] <noob> does anyone have an example of jstree
[06:22:06] <noob> embedded in html
[06:22:11] <noob> i am not able to find one online
[06:22:12] <User276> and i came with a idea which i wanted validated
[06:22:16] <misterm> User276: your question is not directly related to jQuery, and requires a lot of effort and work
[06:22:28] <User276> no it doesn't
[06:22:31] <misterm> User276: so to answer your question, it's most likely possible to do something like you want
[06:22:39] <User276> it would be done with javascript (jquery) if it were possible
[06:22:49] <noob> do i need a php file or .rb file to make a tree with static data
[06:22:50] <noob> ?
[06:22:52] <misterm> User276: but it's not directly related to jQuery, and there's not some little snippet of Javascript I can just hand you to do it
[06:22:58] <User276> which woet says it is which means itheres a properr way to do it
[06:23:17] <User276> i was casking about variables jquery has access to
[06:23:27] <User276> so it is related to jquery
[06:23:53] <misterm> User276: you may have some jquery related questions, but the one you are asking now is not
[06:24:02] <Shwaiil> Q: when doing console.log() for $(el.currentTarget).css('background') , where el is the element / this. I get undefined on IE while it works on otherbrowsers. How can I fix it ? Thanks!
[06:24:14] <User276> ok here it is in jquery format
[06:24:23] <User276> what window variabnles can jquery access
[06:24:54] <misterm> User276: jQuery is just Javascript, so it has access to all the window properties you could access otherwise
[06:25:37] <User276> so not sure who siad it but jquery can only write to the status bar not read from it correct ?
[06:25:48] <noob> can anybody answer my qns?
[06:27:02] <temhawk> User276: jquery does not really have any limitation to regular JS because like misterm said jQuery is JS
[06:27:24] <misterm> noob: can you expand on your question a bit? not sure what you mean
[06:27:26] <temhawk> User276: so accessing status bar text is not possible at all, at least not in all browsers
[06:27:54] <User276> ok thats what i've been trying to find out this whole time x.x
[06:28:08] <User276> and there are no variables in the unload function right ?
[06:28:13] <drecute> can someone help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[06:28:31] <misterm> User276: what do you mean?
[06:28:39] <User276> like
[06:28:59] <temhawk> User276: i would do $(window).unload(function(e){ console.log(e) }); to check but it clears the console :|
[06:29:04] <noob> misterm i am trying to implment a static js tree
[06:29:11] <User276> the click function has offsetx to show where was clicked
[06:29:18] <noob> which expands and contracts
[06:29:20] <noob> in a table
[06:29:33] <User276> yea something like that temhawk
[06:29:40] <noob> so do i need a .php file or .rb file for this
[06:30:00] <noob> or can i do this with simply html script
[06:30:04] <User276> temjawk
[06:30:14] <misterm> noob: ok, it's just "tree" can mean a lot of things, so I wasn't sure...no you don't need a server-side script for that, you can do it client side
[06:30:20] <User276> can u edit that to write a file to the current directory ?
[06:30:29] <noob> i am not able to do that actually

[06:34:15] <juria_roberts> heyy how do I get $.ajax to show please wait while data is being fetched?
[06:35:05] <Theuser276> temhawk *
[06:35:14] <temhawk> Theuser276: User276 ?
[06:35:19] <Theuser276> correct
[06:35:36] <Theuser276> CAn you post the code again ?
[06:35:39] <temhawk> i just realized that Firebug has an option to not clear the console on reload
[06:35:44] <drecute> please can I get help here: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[06:36:11] <misterm> noob: you must be doing something wrong then
[06:36:44] * geekbuntu *hence the name?*
[06:37:03] <Theuser276> :o so does it work temhawk
[06:38:00] <juria_roberts> how do i run some code while ajax fetches data?
[06:38:17] <temhawk> Theuser276: looks like yes there is a property to get the URL
[06:38:33] <Theuser276> awsome
[06:38:47] <geekbuntu> juria_roberts, did you see the example on the .ajax() jquery site?
[06:38:47] <noob> misterm have u implemented a tree in any of ur html code
[06:39:01] <noob> can u point me somewhere how do i embed it in html
[06:39:04] <geekbuntu> if you did -= look @ BeforeSend
[06:39:13] <juria_roberts> geekbuntu: i saw all the examples and none deal with what i asked for
[06:39:34] <drecute> please can I get help here: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/
[06:39:45] <geekbuntu> juria_roberts, you want the spinner while it fetches?
[06:39:53] <juria_roberts> geekbuntu: yup
[06:39:58] <misterm> noob: you said you tried some stuff already? what about putting one of the ones you tried in a jsfiddle and someone may be able to help you fix it
[06:40:11] <Woet> drecute: maybe you would get a response if you actually explain your question/problem
[06:40:21] <Theuser276> how would get the property ? e.attr("href") ?
[06:40:22] <noob> okay misterm will do that then
[06:40:24] <noob> thanks
[06:40:26] <geekbuntu> juria_roberts, then it has it = think about it, before you request, you show a class with the spinner, does the fetch, oncomplete it hides the spinner
[06:40:27] <Woet> drecute: rather than dumping a load of code and just expecting us to do some magic
[06:40:48] <drecute> woet: thanks for responding
[06:40:54] <temhawk> Theuser276: no, "e" is not jQuery so attr() method wouldn't work on it
[06:41:05] <juria_roberts> geekbuntu: ohh so no need for a special attribute
[06:41:05] <temhawk> Theuser276: simply e.property.name.etc
[06:41:26] <drecute> woet: I want to know how to get prettydate plugin to work for simple example
[06:41:34] <geekbuntu> juria_roberts, nope - it's just a css property tht you show/hide
[06:41:49] <geekbuntu> juria_roberts, no magic
[06:41:49] <juria_roberts> geekbuntu: got it
[06:41:51] <Theuser276> hm
[06:41:51] <drecute> Woet: it keeps returning undefined
[06:42:51] <Theuser276> what was the jquery for the on unloadevent again ?
[06:43:12] <Theuser276> temhawk was it $(window).unload(function(){
[06:43:17] <drecute> Woet: as described in the plugin example, this should work, window.alert($("a").prettyDate());
[06:43:24] <temhawk> Theuser276: yes
[06:43:28] <drecute> Woet: unfortunately it didn't
[06:46:24] <Woet> drecute
[06:46:34] <Woet> your code on jsfiddle does not include the prettydate plugin, so it won't work in the first place
[06:46:59] <drecute> Woet: it is included
[06:47:15] <drecute> Woet: check managed resources
[06:47:23] <Woet> drecute: The requested URL /p/jqueryjs/source/browse/trunk/plugins/prettydate/jquery.prettydate.js was not found on this server. Thats all we know.
[06:47:57] <Woet> "NOTE: The jQuery project has moved its source over to Github. You can find the new source repository here: http://github.com/jquery/jquery"
[06:47:58] <Woet> :)
[06:48:05] <Theuser276> like this alert(e.property.attr("name")); ?
[06:48:41] <Woet> drecute: so i'm not sure whether you are using the same URL in your actual webpage, but it won't work
[06:48:46] <Theuser276> is the above right temhawk or did i miss something
[06:49:13] <drecute> Woet: i see now that it is not included
[06:49:28] <drecute> Woet: in my web page, the scrpt is hosted locally
[06:49:38] <Woet> drecute: okay, please include it in jsfiddle properly
[06:53:08] <Theuser276> temhawk still there ?
[06:54:30] <temhawk> Theuser276: attr() is a jQuery method, "e" is not a jQuery object, thus it would not work.
[06:55:07] <Theuser276> o so what would be the proper way ?
[06:55:50] <mazzachre> If I append something to an element, which includes a javascript definition, will that javascript be evaluated?
[06:55:57] <Orbixx> Trying to process a form after a submit button is clicked, but the page just reloads with the form elements in the URL.
[06:56:03] <Theuser276> e.property.name() O.o ?
[06:56:03] <temhawk> Theuser276: e.target.location.href or something like that (that didn't work for me, but there are so, so many other properties in "e" and you just have to look through and test them all, you'll probably find the right one
[06:56:04] <fraserkillip> is there a way to select inputs that are file inputs and have a value that is not empty?
[06:56:12] <Theuser276> o
[06:56:37] <mazzachre> say, $(div).append('<div id="test"></div><script type="text/javascript src="myscript.js"></script>');
[06:56:37] <Theuser276> is there a page that lists e properties ?
[06:56:41] <Orbixx> $('#submitbutton').click() essentially isn't being called
[06:56:49] <temhawk> Theuser276: have you Firebug?
[06:57:21] <Theuser276> no, i use chrome :/
[06:57:24] <mazzachre> Orbixx: grap "submit" event on form, and return false if you don't want default behavior
[06:57:41] <BarelyFitz> fraserkillip: I don't think so. for security reasons you can't look at the value of the file input.
[06:58:06] <mazzachre> Theuser276: crome have a nice javascript console also
[06:58:08] <BarelyFitz> fraserkillip: but you can try it and see :-)
[06:58:17] <Theuser276> o yea
[06:58:25] <shellox> how to use jquery remove() in an append() function?
[06:58:32] <mazzachre> Theuser276: Just open that and you can see all objects and their properties etc... Google "borrowed" that :)
[06:58:35] <fraserkillip> BarelyFitz: you can get the value not set it :)
[06:58:54] <Theuser276> lol
[06:58:57] <temhawk> mazzachre: does Chrome's console have a persistent option?
[06:59:03] <shellox> i add some input fields dynamically, but i also want to make a button to remove the fields from the div
[06:59:18] <shellox> or better said remove the whole div :P
[06:59:35] <Theuser276> wait
[06:59:38] <Theuser276> O.o
[06:59:43] <Theuser276> in googles console
[06:59:50] <Theuser276> all i see is error logs wtc
[06:59:54] <Theuser276> etc
[07:00:20] <shellox> too much crome, i prefer fire and foxes
[07:00:28] <Theuser276> ew
[07:00:47] <Theuser276> i use to use firefox until i downlaoded chrome and saw it was faster :p
[07:01:07] <Theuser276> but anyway mazzarchre how do u view objects and there properties  ?
[07:01:20] <Theuser276> o cool
[07:01:21] <Theuser276> i see now
[07:02:25] <mazzachre> temhawk?
[07:02:35] <temhawk> yes?
[07:02:39] <fraserkillip> so, how to select all inputs with the type of file that don't have an empty value?
[07:02:46] <Theuser276> but i don't think i can pause the unload to view the objects
[07:02:48] <shellox> well firefox runs fine on os x and linux, so there is no reason to look for an alternative ;)
[07:03:01] <drecute> Woet: i have replaced the file
[07:03:02] <Theuser276> and alert disables everythin until u close it :s
[07:03:11] <drecute> Woet: i get object Object
[07:03:40] <Theuser276> o cool
[07:03:45] <Theuser276> u can set breakpoitns
[07:03:57] <drecute> Woet: see http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/3/
[07:05:23] <juria_roberts> how do i remove text inside a div but keep the img tag inside the div?
[07:06:13] <Shwaiil> Q: On IE7/8 when using mouseover / mouseleave for a element, it's allways triggered when moving the mouse over child elements. I dontk now how to fix this, tough 	mouseout: function() {
[07:06:13] <Shwaiil> 		alert('out');	
[07:06:13] <Shwaiil> 	}
[07:06:16] <Shwaiil> ups
[07:06:31] <Shwaiil> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/mouseover.html <- this docs indicateds use of mouseenter and mouseleave to solve
[07:06:34] <Shwaiil> the issue keeps one
[07:06:57] <Shwaiil> I'm wondering, if there's something to do with CSS then ?
[07:08:01] <NL_Ed> erichynds: You here eric?
[07:10:29] <BarelyFitz> fraserkillip: $('input:file[value!=""]')
[07:10:53] <Theuser276> mazzachre
[07:11:06] <Theuser276> is it possible to do a search on properties ?
[07:12:36] <Woet> drecute: works fine for me - http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/4/
[07:12:42] <Gho5t> i am using gRaphael to make a pie chart. it appears that I can attach jquery events to the object. how can i attach a callback to fire after the pie chart is loaded?
[07:12:51] <Woet> drecute: you are using the date "2008-01-28" while it's 2011 now
[07:12:55] <Woet> so prettyDate ignores it
[07:13:34] <temhawk> Theuser276: there is a search bar, you can use it
[07:13:39] <drecute> oh
[07:13:49] <Theuser276> temhawk
[07:13:55] <drecute> Woet: thanks
[07:13:57] <Theuser276> that only searches through elements
[07:14:01] <Theuser276> not properties
[07:14:34] <temhawk> it searches whatever is being shown, so you might have to click on something first, then search it
[07:14:56] <drecute> Woet: but why won't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/q6VMU/5/
[07:15:07] <Woet> drecute: "Hello 20 hours ago"
[07:15:11] <Woet> works fine for me :)
[07:15:34] <drecute> did you modify the date?
[07:15:37] <Woet> nope
[07:15:40] <Woet> just loaded that link
[07:15:41] <drecute> 2011-07-24T19:18:35.837Z
[07:15:46] <Theuser276> temhawk *
[07:15:55] <Woet> drecute: didn't modify anything
[07:16:21] <drecute> probably cache
[07:16:33] <drecute> let me ctrl+f5
[07:16:48] <drecute> didn't work
[07:16:56] <drecute> but what did you do?
[07:17:07] <Woet> drecute: i click the link you gave me and it works fine :P
[07:17:28] <drecute> strange
[07:17:38] <Woet> drecute;
[07:17:42] <Woet> is the time on your machine correct?
[07:17:50] <drecute> yes
[07:17:52] <Woet> hm
[07:18:01] <Gho5t> is there a way to attach an event that fires if a certain elements css display property changes?
[07:18:02] <Woet> odd indeed :)
[07:18:03] <drecute> using FF5
[07:18:31] <drecute> it says Hello January 26th, 2008
[07:23:18] <Gho5t> can someone help me with this issue
[07:24:24] <Gho5t> i have a self-made tab system. it's just some divs that get display block or none. within them is a gRaphael graph that apparently has issues rendering in a hidden div. I have to make sure the graph is loaded only when the div (tab) it is in is visible.
[07:24:29] <Gho5t> what's the most elegant way?
[07:26:28] <drecute> Woet: this is driving nuts. Please do you know what could be wrong?
[07:27:11] <mazzachre> Theuser276: I have not tried to search for a property... I usually know what object I am looking for then looking thorugh it's properties...
[07:28:14] <Theuser276> would this work temhawk / mazzachre console.log(e); ?
[07:29:06] <mazzachre> Theuser276: that would log "object [object]" if e is an object...
[07:29:32] <mazzachre> Or the other way around... [object] object... never could remember that... and not wildly important :D
[07:29:55] <Theuser276> what about something like this
[07:30:08] <Theuser276> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/749266/object-dump-javascript
[07:30:13] <phlp> alert will say that but console should let you examine the object
[07:32:16] <temhawk> Theuser276: add a breakpoint after console.log(e) so you can inspect it (since Webkit inspector does not have a persistent option) before the page actually unloads and clears the console. but I recommend using Firebug instead: you don't need a breakpoint with it (just turn on persistent) and the search is better there actually
[07:32:59] <Theuser276> how would i add a breakpoint
[07:33:45] <temhawk> click on the line number
[07:36:02] <Theuser276> o nice
[07:36:18] <Theuser276> console.log(e); worked
[07:36:39] <Theuser276> but i still can't search through them x.x is manulaly cchecking each drop down the ownly way ?
[07:37:15] <misterm> Theuser276: if you know what you're looking for you can use a watch expression
[07:38:18] <Roland> hi, there. i use this $('#input_id').attr('checked', true).attr('checked'); to check a checkbox and it works fine. also the internetexplorer checked the box but when i send the form i don't get the checkt status. has someone an idea?
[07:38:32] <Theuser276> seems watch only works witht he property name :/
[07:39:03] <misterm> Theuser276: yea, that's what I'm saying
[07:39:28] <purefusion2> I can't seem to get my jQuery $.post() request to trigger the $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUEST'] == 'JSON' to detect Ajax requests... any ideas what I might need to do to get that to work?
[07:40:58] <flayks> hey
[07:41:12] <Woet> purefusion2: I use this (in PHP): 	if(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == "XMLHttpRequest"){
[07:41:27] <flayks> why i have 0 in pos var ? http://pastie.textmate.org/private/mte1nzmlcw2toxj76ikmtw
[07:42:00] <Woet> flayks: read the docs on .scrollTop
[07:42:19] <Woet> flayks: read the docs on .scrollTop
[07:42:21] <Woet> oops
[07:42:23] <Woet> ?scrollTop @ flayks
[07:42:24] <bot-t> flayks, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[07:42:39] <purefusion2> Woet: nice, that worked a treat... thanks!
[07:42:47] <Gho5t> is this valid: $('.someElement')[2].css('display', 'none');
[07:42:54] <Woet> flayks: oh, I'm sorry, I misread. do you have a demo somewhere?
[07:43:05] <flayks> Woet: nop i work in local :/
[07:43:24] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, ?eval var str = 'http://eslgfx.net/gfx/nodelogo/de_small.gif'; return str.substring( url.indexOf('.net')+4 ) );
[07:43:25] <phlp> Gho5t: $('.someElement').eq(2).css('display', 'none');
[07:43:31] <Gho5t> thanks
[07:44:15] <sadmicrowave> hmph, can't do multi line evals with bot
[07:44:49] <Woet> sadmicrowave: probably because you got KuW8t in front
[07:44:54] <Woet> ?eval var str = 'http://eslgfx.net/gfx/nodelogo/de_small.gif'; return str.substring( url.indexOf('.net')+4 ) );
[07:44:56] <bot-t> Woet: SyntaxError: return not in function
[07:44:56] <drecute> Woet: you modified the date from 2011-07-24T19:18:35.837Z to 2011-07-24T19:18:357Z right?
[07:45:12] <sadmicrowave> oooh :) Woet thanks
[07:45:13] <Woet> drecute: no, the only thing i modified in the very begin is 2008-01 to 2011-07
[07:45:18] <KuW8t> ^^
[07:45:27] <sadmicrowave> Woet, I thought I could direct it to someone
[07:45:33] <Woet> ?eval var str = 'http://eslgfx.net/gfx/nodelogo/de_small.gif'; return str.substring( url.indexOf('.net')+4 ) ); @ sadmicrowave
[07:45:34] <bot-t> sadmicrowave: SyntaxError: return not in function
[07:45:36] <Woet> :D
[07:45:43] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:45:47] <sadmicrowave> crap on face
[07:45:49] <drecute> Woet: i removed .83 from the date and it worked
[07:45:57] <Woet> drecute: exciting, it worked for me without change
[07:46:05] <phlp> ?eval var str = 'http://eslgfx.net/gfx/nodelogo/de_small.gif'; str.substring( str.indexOf('.net')+4 );
[07:46:05] <bot-t> phlp: "/gfx/nodelogo/de_small.gif"
[07:46:19] <sadmicrowave> phlp, thanks thats what I was trying to do
[07:46:20] <drecute> could this be a timezone problem?
[07:47:44] <afeijo> hi folks
[07:48:11] <afeijo> I have an ajax return (a few csv lines) that I need to save as a file (download it). How can I do that? header() wont work here
[07:48:23] <the_dud3> How do you exactly select an element that's not "disabled" ?
[07:48:47] <erichynds> the_dud3: :not(:disabled)
[07:48:57] <temhawk> afeijo: just make a normal HTTP request and the browser should show a save-dialog (unless MIME types are messed up)
[07:48:59] <the_dud3> right, thanks
[07:49:30] <the_dud3> erichynds: it should be working inside $() right ?
[07:49:52] <erichynds> yeah. you'll also want to prefix it with another selector, lile $('select:not(:disabled)')
[07:49:55] <afeijo> temhawk, weird, I am doing that. Direct as an url it works
[07:49:56] <juria_roberts> how to delay an ajax call?
[07:50:38] <Woet> juria_roberts: try .delay(1000), but i don't believe it works for ajax
[07:50:43] <temhawk> afeijo: well, that's all you need to do to trigger a save prompt
[07:50:59] <juria_roberts> Woet: where do I put it?
[07:51:12] <Woet> juria_roberts: something like $("#element").delay(1000).load('/ajax/url');
[07:51:32] <jeffsmykil> if i have an xml document and i want to save each <type></type> in an array...
[07:51:36] <jeffsmykil> right now im using
[07:51:40] <afeijo> temhawk, wait, in my $.get callback function, I have this function(data){}, ok? what do with with data?
[07:51:43] <jeffsmykil> var roomID = $(this).find("ID").text();
[07:51:52] <jeffsmykil> but thats treating each letter as a variable
[07:51:56] <jeffsmykil> not each entry
[07:51:57] <juria_roberts> Woet: but i didnt use load
[07:52:09] <Woet> juria_roberts: put your current code on jsfiddle
[07:52:16] <temhawk> afeijo: make the same request with window.location.href
[07:52:44] <jeffsmykil> so essentially I have this:
[07:52:48] <temhawk> afeijo: i.e. don't use Ajax
[07:52:51] <jeffsmykil> var roomID = $(this).find("ID").text();
[07:52:52] <jeffsmykil> $(".mapContainerFloorOne").prepend(roomID[0]);
[07:53:06] <jeffsmykil> and that gives me the first letter, not the first item in the array
[07:53:14] <nisseni> I'm stuck here, I'm making a jQuery.get to get content from a file, in that file I have a link with a shadowbox. It seems like the shadowbox.js doesn't have any effect on the content in the loaded file, can I reload a js somehow?
[07:53:21] <afeijo> temhawk, sorry, I'm using $.post. I cant do that with location.href
[07:53:23] <juria_roberts> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/6aD8v/
[07:53:48] <Woet> juria_roberts: the easiest solution would be to put that code into a function
[07:53:54] <Woet> e.g. resetFunction(){
[07:54:05] <juria_roberts> Woet: it is inside a function
[07:54:08] <Woet> and then use setTimeout('resetFunction()', 5000); for a 5 second delay
[07:54:16] <temhawk> afeijo: hmm.. you could submit a hidden form to send post data
[07:54:35] <temhawk> afeijo: but the point is (I don't think) you can trigger save prompts with JS
[07:54:35] <mazzachre> Woet: Why not just (resetFunction, 5000) ?
[07:54:39] <afeijo> temhawk, bingo! That what I'm doing, the form returns the result
[07:55:02] <afeijo> the result is my csv lines
[07:55:14] <James-_> hello
[07:55:17] <James-_> i have a probleme
[07:55:20] <James-_> problem
[07:55:21] <jeffsmykil> oh look at that
[07:55:21] <VorTechS> uhm, I have a problem with <ol> and and <li> empty().remove(), the first time I delete and item it works fine, every one after fails to remove an item from the list.... anyone seen that?
[07:55:25] <jeffsmykil> i fixed it
[07:55:28] <Woet> mazzachre: i'm used to the way i explained because i usually have arguments with the function
[07:55:30] <James-_> <select id="article_admin_form_cat" name="article_admin_form[cat]">
[07:55:30] <juria_roberts> Woet: before the function is called?
[07:55:39] <James-_> $.post("/ajax/pays", { article_admin_form[cat]: $(this).val() },
[07:55:42] <Woet> juria_roberts: instead of just the function, you replace it with the code i mentioned (or mazzachre)
[07:55:47] <James-_> article_admin_form[cat]  bug why ?
[07:55:51] <mazzachre> Woet: (resetFuntion, 5000, arg1, arg2)
[07:55:55] <temhawk> afeijo: if you submit a form with post and the response is a CSV file with proper MIME type you should get a save prompt
[07:56:03] <Woet> mazzachre: that works with setTimeout?
[07:58:12] <mazzachre> Woet: yes
[07:58:19] <Woet> mazzachre: cool, will remember that. thanks
[07:58:33] <mazzachre> Woet: That is how I do it... if you need to parse runtime arguments to the timeout function
[07:59:10] <purefusion2> is there something that has to be done to a response var of an ajax query that gets a JSON string back from the request? maybe something like eval(response) ?
[07:59:46] <mazzachre> Woet: Like one of my sites that have an "poll update" kind funtion that have a token from the last update... In the success function I do setTimeout(update, 1000, data.token); Where update is the name of the function itself...
[08:00:36] <Woet> mazzachre: I used to do setTimeout('myFunction("argument1", "argument 2");', 5000);
[08:00:41] <Woet> mazzachre: but your code is a lot cleaner
[08:00:43] <afeijo> temhawk, found a way http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_plugin_for_requesting_ajax_like_file_downloads/
[08:01:40] <misterm> purefusion2: in pretty much no circumstances would you want to just eval(JSON)
[08:02:18] <misterm> purefusion2: can you pastebin your code and explain what's happening?
[08:04:15] <colin__> greetings
[08:04:31] <misterm> salutations
[08:05:25] <colin__> i need some help with a jQuery drag&drop script
[08:05:48] <colin__> was hoping someone was willing to help me out
[08:05:48] <iamjarvo> has anyone used scrollTop with jquery ui accordion
[08:08:22] <semperos> using jquery.validate, doesn't seem to fire validation when using backspace key (e.g. required field, someone deletes default value with backspace, validation doesn't occur); any workarounds for this?
[08:08:56] <Veedee> Hi guys, I have this object data=$.parseJSON(data); which is originaly a string. How would I go about iterating over this?
[08:09:15] <colin__> semperos can you fire the function OnKeyDown?
[08:09:20] <misterm> colin__: if you have a question, just ask it..if anyone can help they will
[08:09:54] <nisseni> how can I reload a javascript if I've done jQuery.get and gotten a div with new content?
[08:10:35] <semperos> colin__: I can detect any event, I was curious how to force validation for backspace specifically
[08:10:57] <semperos> because jquery.validate makes some opinionated choices about when it's appropriate to hit the user up with an error message
[08:11:03] <James-_> article_admin_form[cat]  bug why ?    $.post("/ajax/pays", { article_admin_form[cat]: $(this).val() },
[08:11:08] <colin__> alright, well i have 2 <table>'s 1 containing players, and another containing (soccer)matches i need to be able to drag&drop each player into a match
[08:11:44] <colin__> i have the basics working with .draggable() and .droppable() but i need some more 'rules'
[08:12:10] <colin__> only 1 player is allowed to be dropped in a team slot for every match
[08:12:14] <Veedee> anyone?
[08:12:33] <colin__> and i need to be able to drag the player back to it's original position in the table
[08:12:48] <colin__> and the player needs to be moved, not cloned
[08:13:24] <jeffsmykil> How can I save each node with the title foo as a seperate item in an array?  I tried var foo = $(this).find("ID").text(); and var foo = $(this).find("ID");
[08:14:03] <jeffsmykil> the first gives me a letter if I do foo[i]
[08:14:04] <iamjarvo> can someone help me out with this http://pastie.org/2268780
[08:14:14] <jeffsmykil> the second gives me an error
[08:14:56] <James-_> article_admin_form[cat]  bug why ?    $.post("/ajax/pays", { article_admin_form[cat]: $(this).val() },
[08:15:45] <jeffsmykil> maybe i should try each
[08:16:03] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, create an array, then loop through your objects with an .each() and myArray.push( $(this).attr('id') );
[08:16:30] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: that makes sense
[08:16:37] <jeffsmykil> not sure why i didnt think of that
[08:16:41] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, 'in theory'
[08:17:16] <jeffsmykil> is it just var roomID = new Array
[08:17:25] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, are you looking for the 'title' attribute? or the 'id' though?
[08:17:30] <jeffsmykil> heh
[08:17:36] <jeffsmykil> bad naming on my part
[08:17:51] <sadmicrowave> ?array @ jeffsmykil
[08:17:51] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, jQuery.inArray() - Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[08:18:01] <sadmicrowave> hmm, not what I wanted...let me look it up for you
[08:18:10] <jeffsmykil> i have it
[08:18:12] <jeffsmykil> i looked it up

[08:29:32] <DannyZB_> drag and drop:? what did I miss
[08:30:06] <colin__> DannyZB_ i need some help with a drag&drop script
[08:30:17] <DannyZB_> whats wrong with it?
[08:30:37] <colin__> nothing's wrong ;) it's just not yet working how i want it to ;)
[08:30:48] <colin__> i have 2 <table>'s 1 containing players, and another containing (soccer)matches i need to be able to drag&drop each player into a match
[08:30:53] <DannyZB> Ok I guess you don't need any help then (:
[08:30:54] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:30:59] <colin__> i have the basics working with .draggable() and .droppable() but i need some more 'rules'
[08:31:00] <farhad2161> how can i post '???' with jquery  ?
[08:31:11] <colin__> only 1 player is allowed to be dropped in a team slot for every match
[08:31:14] <DannyZB> colin__ : make each table sortable
[08:31:19] <DannyZB> oh
[08:31:24] <colin__> and i need to be able to drag the player back to it's original position in the table
[08:31:27] <urble> James - "don't work" doesn't help me much
[08:31:29] <colin__> and the player needs to be moved, not cloned
[08:31:47] <DannyZB> ok
[08:31:58] <DannyZB> you need to make a droppable out of the player
[08:31:59] <James-_> urble i put    function(data){
[08:31:59] <James-_> 		    	alert('ok');
[08:32:02] <DannyZB> and make it a div , not a table element
[08:32:07] <James-_> and there are no alert
[08:32:09] <DannyZB> and drop it into table cells meant for it
[08:32:25] <DannyZB> make draggable div's and droppable table cells
[08:32:25] <colin__> ok
[08:32:39] <sadmicrowave> guys, am I mistaken or didn't I see that I can use .contents() to get the innerHTML of a div from a separate url?
[08:32:43] <DannyZB> you want to drop table cells or table rows ?
[08:33:04] <colin__> doesn't really matter
[08:33:22] <DannyZB> colin : if you didn't know , you need to get familiar with the drop callback
[08:33:23] <colin__> even an li would do
[08:33:29] <DannyZB> you can reformat dropped objects
[08:33:41] <DannyZB> in case you want to drop a div into a tr , for example
[08:34:01] <urble> James: might be good to see if you are getting successful response. are you using firebug or equivalent?
[08:34:15] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: how do I say this correctly?  roomID.push( $(this).find('ID[i]'));
[08:34:38] <DannyZB> Guys , you know how you make something thats really good coding and nobody gives a s*it ?
[08:34:42] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:35:24] <olli314> Hi !
[08:35:30] <James-_> yes i use firebug urble
[08:35:56] <phlp> jeffsmykil: var roomID = $(this).find("ID").map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get();
[08:35:59] <urble> are you seeing a server response in the console when you do your ajax post?
[08:36:05] <James-_> article_admin_form is not defined
[08:36:05] <James-_> [Stopper sur une erreur] dict[article_admin_form[cat]] = $(this).val();
[08:36:17] <colin__> DannyZB this is what i have at the moment, mostly copied and altered from an example from the jQuery site: http://pastebin.com/vh2Gh45c
[08:36:35] <jeffsmykil> phlp: that's pretty scary
[08:36:46] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:36:58] <phlp> jeffsmykil: i seen what you asked earlier. that will give you an array like you wanted
[08:37:12] <jeffsmykil> thanks phlp still frightening
[08:37:14] <olli314> I need some help about html asycnhronous loading. If I try to load template with asynchronously, everything works, otherwise I have an error (reported in the bug #8135). Is somebody CAn help me ?
[08:37:42] <DannyZB> colin__: why a li ?
[08:37:43] <James-_> urble i got this : article_admin_form is not defined
[08:37:43] <James-_> error : dict[article_admin_form[cat]] = $(this).val();
[08:37:48] <DannyZB> I thought you were working with tables
[08:38:01] <jeffsmykil> phlp: do i have any hope of ever understandng that?
[08:38:02] <nisseni> I'm using jQuery.getScript('js/shadowbox.js') - the script is loading, however, it won't run as I click a link with rel="shadowbox" - any ideas?
[08:38:04] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:38:10] <colin__> yeah i was, but i changed it to a <ol> at some point
[08:38:42] <DannyZB> colin__ do you really have to redo the formatting?
[08:38:47] <phlp> jeffsmykil: i would start here http://api.jquery.com/map
[08:38:55] <DannyZB> the way you are doing it , you can just let it drop as it is
[08:38:56] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[08:39:13] <urble> James: Is article_admin_form a form element?
[08:39:16] <DannyZB> get rid of the drop event make your life easier
[08:39:20] <DannyZB> you can do it in css
[08:39:22] <sadmicrowave> guys, can someone help me with this, I've never used .load() to get div contents of an external url before.  http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vnZ6S/2/
[08:39:26] <leo44> hi
[08:39:43] <James-_> urble http://pastie.org/2268875
[08:40:14] <colin__> alright
[08:40:18] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:40:41] <leo44> the first promise() example (see: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/) seems to break with jQuery 1.6.2
[08:40:56] <leo44> is it a bug in the example, or a bug in jQuery ?
[08:41:01] <colin__> DannyZB is there a way to only allow a item to be dropped in an empty place?
[08:41:02] <DannyZB> colin__ : what i mean is .. you can make a style : #droppedtable div.dropped_element {// some style applied to dropped elements , like resizing and hiding parts }
[08:41:06] <urble> $("#article_admin_form_cat").val() might be what you want
[08:41:12] <DannyZB> colin : yes
[08:41:26] <James-_> hum ?
[08:41:27] <DannyZB> you can return false in the "drop" callback if a condition is matched , if I remember correctly
[08:41:40] <James-_> show me urble plz
[08:42:15] <farhad2161> when i post ??? (3 question mark) with jquery.ajax ,it convert ??? to jQuery1603493378913067269_1311607425259?
[08:42:20] <urble> James: this would be a good time to take a step back and read some tutorials. It will save you a lot of time going forward.
[08:43:11] <leo44> oops, I mean, the second one..
[08:43:59] <colin__> DannyZB thnx i'll look into that
[08:44:00] <purefusion2> is it possible to go from a css-applied class="hidden" style of display: none ...then somehow remove the class and go into a slide-down fade in to visibility?
[08:44:01] <CannedCorn> what folder do you put plugins in
[08:44:01] <CannedCorn> ?

[08:59:55] <farhad2161> how can i post '???' with jquery  ?
[09:00:13] <DannyZB> farhad

[09:01:02] <farhad2161> DannyZB: posting to another page!
[09:02:59] <DannyZB> farhad there's an escape character for that
[09:03:02] <DannyZB> 1 sec i'll check
[09:03:36] <DannyZB> http://www.anglesanddangles.com/asciichart.php
[09:03:37] <madprops> can I assign a click event to links with a class in a certain div only?

[09:04:03] <DannyZB> &#63;
[09:04:21] <sejo> Hey all I use the jquery-ui plugin for the tabs, but apparently I do something wrong, is it because my content is not in the same div as the tabs? http://test.beauty-webshop.be
[09:06:02] <jeffsmykil> phlp: what if i have sub nodes?
[09:06:02] <drecute> please how do I convert Sun, 24 Jul 2011 15:43:36 +0000 to UTC date and time?

[09:07:27] <phlp> jeffsmykil: what are you wanting to do with them?
[09:07:28] <misterm> DannyZB: it would actually be just this.pause()
[09:07:35] <jeffsmykil> same thing put them in an array
[09:07:44] <jeffsmykil> but not the text this time
[09:07:52] <DannyZB> misterm : both work
[09:07:55] <jeffsmykil> the actual node name
[09:08:36] <jeffsmykil> cam i even give a node a name?
[09:08:42] <jeffsmykil> i know i can give it a n id
[09:08:50] <drecute> please how do I convert Sun, 24 Jul 2011 15:43:36 +0000 to UTC date and time?
[09:08:52] <misterm> DannyZB: pause() is not a jQuery method
[09:09:22] <DannyZB> oh heh
[09:09:23] <DannyZB> my bad
[09:09:40] <DannyZB> It still may work ><
[09:10:16] <misterm> DannyZB: it wouldn't, but if it did it would be wasteful, :-)
[09:10:17] <jeffsmykil> phip I have a room inside that room is contents and then contents is a sub node
[09:11:24] <DannyZB> true .. true
[09:11:35] <DannyZB> let me hide my wounded ego in peace XD
[09:12:25] <phlp> jeffsmykil: $(this).find('ID contents').children().map(function() { return this.nodeName; }).get();
[09:12:32] <jeffsmykil> ah
[09:12:35] <jeffsmykil> that makes some sense
[09:12:42] <jeffsmykil> i think i just found another way to do it :D
[09:24:08] <DannyZB> < is back
[09:32:52] <sadmicrowave> yan_nick, what about $('audio').pause()
[09:33:13] <yan_nick> sadmicrowave: found another way but thx
[09:33:40] <sadmicrowave> ok
[09:34:41] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey i posted this in the jquery mobile channel but ill post it here to : hey guys heres a trading game im working on with jquery mobile. http://jsfiddle.net/ElCapitanMarklar/TqqAt/ can you take a look and offer any advice? cheers
[09:43:40] <BlaDe^> Hi guys - my margin-top doesn't work here so I want to add a blank <tr> with a height set between the new rows.. how can I do that? -- http://jsfiddle.net/hM22D/2/
[09:44:23] <ElCapitanMarklar> put your margin on the table cell
[09:44:25] <ElCapitanMarklar> not the table row
[09:45:51] <BlaDe^> ElCapitanMarklar http://jsfiddle.net/hM22D/3/
[09:45:51] <BlaDe^> doesn't work either
[09:45:56] <BlaDe^> i think a blank <tr> with height is the best solution but not sure how to add it
[09:46:07] <BlaDe^> i tried playing with .insertBefore/.insertAfter and .append/.prepend couldn't get it to work
[09:46:24] <phlp> BlaDe^: http://jsfiddle.net/hM22D/4
[09:48:02] <BlaDe^> phlp - i've tried that, the problem is it re-aligns the label too (on the proper site)
[09:48:06] <BlaDe^> so I think a blank tr is the only way
[09:49:16] <BlaDe^> ah wait - i got it! thanks guys
[10:07:18] <colin__> DannyZB hi
[10:11:54] <colin__> ok so i have the max elements for the droppable figured out
[10:12:29] <colin__> now i need to know how i can make the element just drop into the container and not revert back to it's position
[10:13:27] <colin__> DannyZB you still there?
[10:14:38] <Muuuh> How long does it usually take for moderators to approve posts on the jquery forum ? Is the forum actively monitored ?
[10:15:07] <gizero> Hi. I want to have a text and an info icon next to it, on one line. That should be simple, but I can't get it working. Any clues?
[10:17:37] <Conanbatt> One question. Im building a browser extension and i want to use Jquery to make it easily crossbrowser. I have added JQuery to the extension javascripts, but when i try to use it is undefined. My Jquery code runs when the page has included Jquery already
[10:17:57] <Conanbatt> Is there a difference between having the script loaded as a browser extension, or loaded from the page?
[10:18:53] <misterm> Conanbatt: what browser?
[10:19:07] <Conanbatt> im trying out chrome right now
[10:19:26] <misterm> AFAIK jQuery should work in a chrome extension
[10:19:35] <Conanbatt> i added the file, and i get a weird behavior. jQuery is not defined, but $("something") gives out null ( no error)
[10:19:46] <gizero> <p><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" class="ui-icon ui-icon-info"></span>My text</p>              <-- That almost works, but the icon is always in it's active state.
[10:19:49] <misterm> Conanbatt: do you have it in noConflict mode?
[10:20:03] <ajpiano> Conanbatt, are you loading jquery as a contentscript
[10:20:04] <misterm> Conanbatt: can you pastebin your code somewhere?
[10:20:18] <misterm> Conanbatt: and are you loading/using it in the same context?
[10:20:27] <Conanbatt> i dont know what "noConflict" mode is let me look
[10:20:33] <misterm> Conanbatt: chrome extensions have like several different "pieces"
[10:20:52] <Conanbatt> ajpiano: i do have it as a content script
[10:21:23] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: fwiw, just using jQuery in your extension won't magically make it a cross browser extension unless you do a bunch of other work as well
[10:22:12] <Conanbatt> yes i know, but i want to make the dom manipulation browser independant
[10:22:23] <misterm> eh ,it depends on what the extension does
[10:22:28] <miketaylr> for an extension that runs in a single browser?
[10:22:47] <misterm> If it's a grease-monkey type script using jQuery for the page manipulations would help
[10:23:29] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: are you sure that you're like, on a page where yo'ure actually injecting the contentscript
[10:24:13] <Conanbatt> its a grease monkey extension, yes
[10:24:32] <Conanbatt> ajpiano: in the list of scripts loaded from the javascript debugger i can see the jquery script
[10:24:41] <Conanbatt> i tried $.noConflict() but its undefined
[10:25:32] <Conanbatt> maybe something is being a nuisance, because  "$" gives me something thats not Jquery
[10:25:41] <ajpiano> sounds like it
[10:25:44] <ajpiano> can you see typeof jQuery
[10:25:51] <miketaylr> $ where, chrome dev tools?
[10:25:56] <Conanbatt> "function"
[10:26:00] <Conanbatt> yes, mike
[10:26:01] <miketaylr> $ is a shortcut for qSA
[10:26:14] <miketaylr> or gEBID, i dont' remember
[10:26:28] <Conanbatt> that doesnt tell me why jQuery is undefined, except someone is explicitly erasing it
[10:26:37] <erichynds> i think it's qsa
[10:26:45] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: you just said it was a function, not undefined
[10:26:47] <ajpiano> so therefore it's there
[10:26:50] <Conanbatt> sorry ajpiano: it saiys undefined
[10:26:51] <Conanbatt> wrong window
[10:26:55] <Conanbatt> i made mistake, sorry :)
[10:27:04] <ajpiano> are you logging that out from a contentscript
[10:27:08] <Conanbatt> ( typeof jQuery => "undefined" )
[10:27:12] <ajpiano> or just in the console?
[10:27:15] <Conanbatt> console
[10:27:29] <ajpiano> the console doesn't have access to the contentscript's isolated window
[10:27:40] <ajpiano> you're looking in the drawer for something that's in the cabinet
[10:28:19] <Conanbatt> ok, so that takes away some visibility.
[10:29:00] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: what does your manifest.json look like, do you have another script after jquery you can use to write out test code?
[10:29:17] <Conanbatt> yes i can add something. What do you suggest?
[10:29:35] <ajpiano> i would add another script and then call console.log(typeof jQuery) from there
[10:29:44] <ajpiano> you have to do it from something that's being included by the extension
[10:30:22] <ajpiano> FYI http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html#execution-environment
[10:31:25] <BillCriswell> How would I select <a> elements that have only a visible image element child?
[10:31:26] <Conanbatt> ok so i did that and it returns "function" so for the scripts purpose its loaded
[10:31:50] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: yup, just read about the execution environment and you will see why that is the case
[10:31:51] <BillCriswell> I took a shot with $('#gallery a:visible') but no luck.
[10:32:15] <ajpiano> BillCriswell: $("#gallery a:has(img:visible)") ?
[10:32:16] <hughessd> hi, does anyone know a possible reason why a click event wouldn't fire unless an alert was in the callback?
[10:32:24] <BillCriswell> Niiiiice.
[10:32:51] <Conanbatt> yes i understand. It makes sense, but without a console log its kind of hard , in my case, to test it out.
[10:33:07] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Completely forgot about :has.
[10:33:35] <ajpiano> Conanbatt: welcome to extension development
[10:33:47] <hughessd> i have a div that I want to show on a button click, but $('#mydiv').toggle(); won't work unless there is an alert('blah'); after it inside the $('').click(function() {
[10:33:53] <hughessd> });
[10:34:25] <ajpiano> hughessd: no one has ever heard of that behaviour i promise
[10:34:31] <ajpiano> you are very likely doing something else wrong
[10:34:41] <hughessd> probably
[10:34:42] <ajpiano> is your code in a document ready block or whatnot
[10:34:52] <hughessd> that's what im trying to figure out
[10:34:57] <hughessd> it's so simple that it should work
[10:35:27] <hughessd> and there's no reason for the inclusion of an alert to make or break a function call, that i can think of at least
[10:35:46] <jeffsmykil> phlp: can I PM you?
[10:35:47] <hughessd> yes, it is inside the document ready
[10:36:03] <hughessd> and the other code in the file is working properly
[10:37:00] <jeffsmykil> traversing through xml sucks
[10:41:31] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, no argument there
[10:41:47] <jeffsmykil> i think ill take lunch
[10:41:51] <jeffsmykil> then come back and attack it
[10:48:14] <angryasian> Hey guys. I don't want to turn a link into a button using jquery mobile.  Thoughts?  in the data-role="footer" section I have the following html.  <a href="tel:xxx"><img/></a>
[10:49:02] <sadmicrowave> you "don't" want to?
[10:49:04] <aghouseh> heh
[10:49:09] <aghouseh> i think i read that like 4-5 times
[10:49:26] <sadmicrowave> if you "don't" want to, then don't
[10:49:31] <aghouseh> but he cant help himself
[10:50:02] <sadmicrowave> e.preventDefault()
[10:50:16] <sadmicrowave> inside the click() event
[10:51:12] <angryasian> okay how many of you have actually used jquery mobile?
[10:51:35] <Lepidosteus__> i did
[10:51:51] <angryasian> jquery mobile automatically converts links to buttons.  I don't want it to do so in this particular case.  What should I do?
[10:51:54] <sadmicrowave> I haven't, but if you actually wanted just jquery mobile users, you should have asked it in the #jquerymobile room
[10:51:59] <angryasian> I did
[10:52:01] <angryasian> they are all sleeping
[10:53:00] <sadmicrowave> angryasian, what about making a <div></div> with a js click handler with window.location = 'mylink.html'; in the function handler
[10:53:20] <sadmicrowave> instead of <a></a>
[10:53:50] <DannyZB_> Guys , a non-jquery question : Say I have a facebook application for file sharing .. what incentives can I give users in an affiliate program ?
[10:54:01] <Woet> angryasian: "To turn a link into a button in jQuery Mobile, simply add data-role="button" to the a tag"
[10:54:12] <Woet> don't add the tag and you won't get a button?
[10:54:12] <angryasian> I DONT WANT IT TO TURN INTO A BUTTON
[10:54:16] <angryasian> it does it anyways
[10:54:17] <Woet> exactly
[10:54:18] <aghouseh> he is trying to prevent it
[10:54:18] <aghouseh> hehe
[10:54:19] <Woet> so don't add the tag..
[10:54:23] <angryasian> I'm not
[10:54:33] <Woet> then you have a custom jquery mobile configuration/build
[10:54:42] <Woet> ?demo @ angryasian
[10:54:42] <bot-t> angryasian, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:54:44] <erichynds> angryasian: wrap it in a <div>
[10:58:59] <angryasian> ok making something for you guys... need to get rid of un-necessary crap
[10:59:10] <erichynds> angryasian: just wrap it in a <div>
[11:00:50] <angryasian> ok ill try the div thing first :)
[11:02:38] <angryasian> okay so erichynds wins.  and so does sadmicrowave.
[11:02:43] <angryasian> +1
[11:03:02] <sadmicrowave> :)
[11:04:01] <angryasian> what was all that stuff about .click micro? that confused me
[11:04:28] <DannyZB> f
[11:04:36] <angryasian> Oooh I see... you wanted me to make a div and then bind .click to it.
[11:04:49] <angryasian> I just did <div><a href="asdf"><img/></a></div>
[11:04:57] <angryasian> that seemed to miraculously work
[11:05:14] <Laurent1> Hi guys, I have a weird thing going on with jQuery: I'm using 1.6.2 and when I use the file scheme some events like change on a select element is not working...
[11:05:32] <Laurent1> But it does with the http scheme?!?
[11:05:36] <Laurent1> any thoughts?
[11:05:56] <miketaylr> weird
[11:06:05] <miketaylr> are you trying to xhr in stuff via file://?
[11:06:07] <erichynds> is it the event itself or the logic inside the event handler?
[11:06:07] <Eviltwin> Laurent1: Can you give us any more specifics?
[11:07:53] <Laurent1> ok so: no ajax, however when I open the console and redo the same $('#videos').change(function(e){
[11:07:54] <Laurent1>     });
[11:08:01] <Laurent1> it works in this case in the console
[11:08:19] <Laurent1> $('#videos') being my select element
[11:09:08] <Laurent1> and also this logic is in the document ready event handler
[11:09:38] <Laurent1> so it should work :(
[11:09:56] <miketaylr> in all browsers?
[11:11:25] <gnarf> Laurent1: whats the use case for running from a file:// url?
[11:11:25] <Laurent1> hum let me check really quick
[11:11:39] <Laurent1> just in dev mode
[11:11:44] <gnarf> use a server
[11:11:53] <Laurent1> I just don't want to run a server everytime I test
[11:12:04] <gnarf> then you aren't really testing are you
[11:12:05] <Laurent1> it would make sense for AJAX only right?
[11:12:13] <Laurent1> hum you got me
[11:12:24] <Laurent1> :)
[11:12:49] <Laurent1> though this event thing drives me nuts
[11:12:50] <gnarf> domain relative urls break under file:/// too
[11:13:28] <gnarf> Laurent1: its a weird bug, but you aren't going to be serving your html over file:/// anyway, so why care?
[11:13:33] <miketaylr> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
[11:13:35] <miketaylr> BAM
[11:13:41] <Laurent1> yep I did this
[11:13:54] <gnarf> my thought is that you prolly have a <script src="/js/something.js"></script>
[11:13:58] <Laurent1> and it works well with the http scheme
[11:14:21] <gnarf> and that domain relative url is gonna break in file:///
[11:14:24] <Laurent1> I have this in my <head> element <script src="jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>
[11:14:24] <Laurent1>     <script src="script.js"></script>
[11:14:47] <gnarf> are both being loaded?
[11:14:54] <Laurent1> yep
[11:15:11] <Laurent1> I even do a console.log in the document ready and it works
[11:15:50] <Laurent1> but the change or even click on a button does not work
[11:15:58] <Laurent1>  shaking my <head>
[11:24:22] <janthony> Does anyone have a good recommendation on a jquery scrollbar plugin? One that can be used for scrolling content in a div, not the entire page?
[11:27:09] <SilentPenguin> what for? you can get pretty much anything you want by styling the scrollbar with css
[11:27:20] <angryasian> I actually wrote code for that myself... found it easier.  Use the offset and scrollTop options along with a little animation delay to make things neat
[11:28:16] <SilentPenguin> but, what about browsers that don't render scrollbars...
[11:28:46] <angryasian> You dont need a scrollbar when you have javascript!
[11:28:54] <janthony> SilentPenguin: it's for a fixed width/height div that contains content that cannot be seen due to overflow: hidden;
[11:29:52] <janthony> SilentPenguin: The content is being added to div via ajax. Sometimes the content will need a scrollbar, sometimes it won't.
[11:29:53] <SilentPenguin> use overflow: scroll instead
[11:30:04] <janthony> SilentPenguin: Tried it, it looked like garbage
[11:30:19] <SilentPenguin> then let the browser decide if it needs a scrollbar or not then
[11:30:49] <angryasian> dont use overflow:scroll.  Hide it and then use javascript to scroll. I presume you're goign to have buttons that call scrollUp() and scrollDown()
[11:30:59] <janthony> SilentPenguin: That still doesn't make it not look like garbage. :P
[11:31:02] <SilentPenguin> scroll will force the browser to put the scrollbar in regardless of it being needed
[11:31:29] <tydeas> I use $.params to encode a js object. How can I decode it ?
[11:31:34] <SilentPenguin> I see absolutely no advantage here for creating a scrollbar using javascript
[11:31:48] <Laurent1> hey guys, can you tell me if this app works for you? http://laurent-tonon.com/h5videoapp/
[11:31:53] <janthony> angryasian: Yeah, that's what I'm going for. I usually just make these things custom, but decided to try and use a plugin this time.
[11:31:54] <tydeas> Or how can I encode/decode json without use of any extra lib ?
[11:31:57] <angryasian> the advantage is that it might look neater.
[11:33:06] <phlp> everything looks neater to the person who made it. it's cool to make stuff, but it will probably look more like garbage than the default to everyone else
[11:33:22] <janthony> angryasian: I don't see scrollUp() and scrollDown() in the documentation though.
[11:33:46] <janthony> angryasian: Is that a jquery UI thing?
[11:34:29] <SilentPenguin> phlp, agreed
[11:34:46] <angryasian> scrollTop()
[11:34:52] <angryasian> and offset()
[11:35:04] <angryasian> I'm writing a lil demo for you :)
[11:35:10] <janthony> angryasian: Ahh, thanks!
[11:36:06] <Assimilater> Hi, so I'm getting weird behavior here, can anyone help me figure out why it's allowing me to select multiple buttons and why it's not appearing to step into my if-statement? http://jsfiddle.net/BU5We/
[11:36:37] <SilentPenguin> janthony, why implement what the browser already supports, considerably more effectively, either your issue is a browser bug, or /not/ what you think it is
[11:36:58] <janthony> SilentPenguin: For styling purposes.
[11:37:45] <SilentPenguin> janthony, but you can already style scrollbars with css
[11:38:21] <diamonds> http://old.nabble.com/backgroundPositionY-td19634565s27240.html
[11:38:24] <diamonds> is this still true?
[11:38:37] <diamonds> no backgroundPositionY for firefox?
[11:38:45] <diamonds> no polyfill in jquery?
[11:38:57] <diamonds> the great cross-browser equalizer?
[11:39:21] <janthony> SilentPenguin: Is styling scrollbars supported by all browsers? I would want to hide the horizontal scrollbar + change the colors/texture of the vertical scroll bar.
[11:39:22] <magnus_> hey. when i use $.getJSON(url, otherobj.callback) , any references to "this" from within my callback seem to not refer to otherobj. Is this correct?
[11:40:37] <janthony> SilentPenguin: I kind of dismissed that option as the current scrollbar is very bulky for what I want.
[11:41:57] <phlp> janthony: overflow-y:scroll for only vertical scrollbar
[11:42:47] <SilentPenguin> well, I managed a css scrollbar styled similarly to one in mac os x lion using just the css properties, so i'm sure it will be flexable enough for your needs, just google around, although i didn't use it, they support pictures and such iirc
[11:43:56] <SilentPenguin> plus, they'll be supported on the forray of recent browsers, anything that doesn't support it will probably have a grim implementation in js (and might be hidious to use anyway)
[11:44:17] <SilentPenguin> so, the browser would probably be doing you a favour in that respect
[11:44:32] <SilentPenguin> plus, browsers that don't have scrollbars, won't render them
[11:45:05] <SilentPenguin> so, mobile devices won't be marred by your custom scrollbars
[11:46:19] <pootpoot> when i do $.each($(".thing"), function(index, element) return element; ) is that the same as returning $(".thing") ?
[11:48:01] <pootpoot> is element the raw html object or a jquery object?
[11:48:01] <superjacaman> Someone can help me?
[11:48:19] <phlp> pootpoot: no return in the each callback is used to cancel the loop (return false) or skip to the next iteration (return)
[11:48:29] <Assimilater> ok so what i'm trying to do is make only one button selectable at a time, and i only what what's in that click function to execute if the user just switched (ie if they click a button twice it doesn't reset view's html twice), can someone help me figure this out? http://jsfiddle.net/BU5We/2/
[11:48:43] <pootpoot> phlp i was just using that as an example, not actually doing it lol
[11:48:48] <schwab> whats the most effective way to build a JSON array on the client side
[11:48:51] <gnarf> pootpoot: $(".thing").each( function( index, element ) { this === element === DOMElement });
[11:49:13] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/HFe3B/
[11:49:17] <gnarf> pootpoot: $.each( $(...) doesn't make a ton of sense since $() has a .each
[11:49:21] <pootpoot> so DOMElement === jQuery(".thing")[0] ?
[11:49:27] <gnarf> pootpoot: correct
[11:49:29] <angryasian> janthony thats for you: http://jsfiddle.net/HFe3B/
[11:49:36] <pootpoot> ok i see
[11:50:17] <superjacaman> http://pastebin.com/PqYBnpaF if someone can see this code and help me
[11:50:59] <versatiletech> Laurent1: Doesn't work in FF3.6, FF4, or FF5. Works in Safari. Firefox only supports OGG. I see you have a .ogv video. How are you exporting your videos?
[11:53:24] <superjacaman> my code is like the lavalamp plugin
[11:54:07] <WebDragon> http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php  got this page, see... the markup is generated from some clean text with Markdown -- I'd prefer not to add html wrapping to it any more than necessary to generate this html with. However, I've been asked for something: they want the sections below the H2's to 'fold up/out' when clicked
[11:54:42] <WebDragon> so I'd like to know if it's possible to find h2's .. collect up all the p's below it up until either the next h2, or the end of the containing parent, and then wrap that in a div so they can be folded/unfolded
[11:55:06] <WebDragon> http://phantomlab.com/documents.php  sorta like this
[11:55:51] <jedrek> jquery's giving me a weird error - Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token function
[11:56:37] <LaytonsDad> I am trying to find a way to read a txt file and put the contents into a div
[11:56:41] <versatiletech> jedrek: maybe you have a syntax error
[11:56:46] <versatiletech> jsfiddle.net
[11:57:13] <jedrek> i googled around for it, most of the solutions involved fixing the data sent via .ajax calls, but even when i use just .post("script.php"); it doesn't query the script and i get the error
[11:58:11] <Xeon06_> Is there a jquery way to get a DOM element from a jquery selector, appart from the obvious bracket accessor?
[11:58:48] <madprops> what's the best way if a link with a certain class exists inside a div?
[11:58:58] <WebDragon> anyone know how I would go about creating the selector for such elements ? take this: div( h2 p p p p h2 p p p h2 p p p p ) and convert it to div( div(h2 p p p p) div(h2 p p p) div(h2 p p p p) ) on the fly with jquery
[11:58:59] <phlp> ? .get @ Xeon06_
[11:59:00] <bot-t> Xeon06_, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:59:01] <trose> so i'm passing data from one page to another using GET ie. i'm linking to <my url>?myvar=something How do i then get that info on the destination page?
[11:59:03] <madprops> im thinking in looking for the closest one, get the text and see if it = ''
[11:59:09] <pootpoot> $('.thing').has('.otherClass').length
[11:59:13] <Xeon06_> phlp: Thanks
[11:59:31] <madprops> pootpoot cool
[12:00:41] <magicbronson> Anyone know of a js lib to turn a number like "347525360" into something like "347K"?
[12:00:50] <Assimilater> can anyone assist me with ^^ ?
[12:01:39] <trose> ... you could do that with string manipulation...
[12:02:24] <magicbronson> trose: i know, i'm wondering if there's a good library for it so i don't have to reinvent the wheel
[12:02:39] * magicbronson googled "fuzzy number javascript" to no avail
[12:02:41] <Laurent1> versatiletech: I just downloaded the video from some websites
[12:02:57] <Laurent1> it's a show case application that I'm writing for a class
[12:03:00] <joeellis> If you remove (through .remove()) an html element that contains another element that has an event bound to it, does it remove those bindings as well, or are they retained somewhere in memory
[12:03:26] <joeellis> Or:  what's the best / most complete way to remove an element from  a page that may contain sub-elements with bindings
[12:03:53] <Laurent1> I'm trying to use lot of things: localStorage, video, canvas, webWorker so the image can be rendered in B and W by the browser
[12:04:16] <Laurent1> I'm planning to include chat features using web sockets and offline app
[12:04:30] <ch3mical> AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHH
[12:04:48] <versatiletech> Laurent1: hmm probably better to find a different video in mov, avi, or mp4 format and then convert it to Ogg. You'll want to have different videos to support different browsers like MP4 and OGG. http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html
[12:06:08] <Laurent1> versatiletech: yeah I know it's just I don't know how to check on the fly if a codec is supported by the browser
[12:06:29] <Laurent1> versatiletech: I mean I can but I have to be 100% sure about the codec I'll use
[12:06:43] <versatiletech> yeah that page will give you a rundown of what to do for each browser
[12:07:55] <Laurent1> hum the goal is more: "let's take the most recent browser with the most features and let's see what you can do with HTML5"
[12:08:02] <Laurent1> it's more like a showcase
[12:08:30] <Laurent1> thanks for the feedback though :)
[12:08:46] <Laurent1> I'll try to find out a solution for this video support
[12:08:56] <pootpoot> what's the best way to remove a div and place it somewhere else?
[12:09:18] <Laurent1> $(dest).append(yourdiv)
[12:09:34] <pootpoot> but if it exists on the page, how would it get removed
[12:09:49] <Laurent1> I would be removed since you wanna move it
[12:10:01] <sadmicrowave> pootpoot, .detach()
[12:10:19] <sadmicrowave> ?detach @ pootpoot
[12:10:19] <bot-t> pootpoot, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[12:10:29] <pootpoot> thx
[12:10:45] <Laurent1> but here you wanna move it, so why detach first?
[12:11:11] <Assimilater> i'm trying to make only one button selectable at a time, and i only what what's in that click function to execute if the user just switched (ie if they click a button twice it doesn't reset view's html twice), can someone help me figure this out? http://jsfiddle.net/BU5We/2/
[12:11:19] <WebDragon> $("p,ul").prev("p, ul").wrap("<div class='menusection' />");  this wraps each one individually. I need to wrap them as a group.
[12:11:23] <sadmicrowave> Laurent1, how else do you plan on removing it from its current position and placing it somewhere else?
[12:11:47] <sadmicrowave> .append() doesn't remove it from its current location
[12:11:48] <pootpoot> i think the sequence is $(".thing").detach().append("#content")
[12:11:52] <WebDragon> even if this leaves me with h2 div( p ul p p) h2 div(p p p ul) ... etc
[12:12:06] <WebDragon> parent() won't work here
[12:12:14] <sadmicrowave> pootpoot, you are correct
[12:12:26] <WebDragon> I just need to select them all and wrap once rather than wrap each
[12:12:36] <sadmicrowave> detach $('.thing') from its current location. then append $('.thing') to $('#content')
[12:13:00] <WebDragon> I know I'm not selecting them quite correctly
[12:13:22] <WebDragon> but I can't seem to wrap my head around how to do the selection the way I want. I may have to resort to manually adding divs to the Markdown
[12:13:51] <sadmicrowave> WebDragon, is p a child of ul?
[12:13:56] <sadmicrowave> or the other way around?
[12:13:57] <WebDragon> though I'd prefer not to "pollute" the master documents any more than necessary, to make them as easy to edit for the uninformed matre'd as possible
[12:14:03] <WebDragon> sadmicrowave: neither, they are siblings
[12:14:13] <WebDragon> sadmicrowave: here's some sample copy
[12:14:18] <sadmicrowave> well then you will have to wrap them individually
[12:14:23] <WebDragon> http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php
[12:14:40] <cbobo> if I have an iFrame, that is display:none; and then I use ($('#myiframe').hide() to unhide the iframe will it only be usable then?  ([ Reason is because this iframe has google code that I only want to be called at a certion time )]
[12:14:57] <trose> can $.get() be used to retrieve information from the current URL? ie. if i have example.html?variable=foo can i get the contents of variable????
[12:14:57] <WebDragon> what I need to do is wrap (h2 + p + ul + p ) (h2 + p + p + p)
[12:14:58] <here4thegear> I'm parsing some information based on checkboxes. $('input:checkbox') and performing a .each function. Is there anyway to drill down even further within the selector to where value=somestring so that I don't have to itterate in my each function?
[12:15:07] <WebDragon> sadmicrowave: what I need to do is wrap (h2 + p + ul + p ) (h2 + p + p + p)
[12:15:13] <sadmicrowave> cbobo, don't you want .show() to unhide an element?
[12:15:23] <cbobo> yes, sorry .show()
[12:15:34] <roger_padactor> http://pastebin.com/ZkXdW7kw  doesn't do the replace. I have no idea why. please help
[12:15:53] <sadmicrowave> cbobo, if it is display:none then it is not usuable
[12:15:56] <sadmicrowave> usable*
[12:16:13] <cbobo> okay, so this will work, great
[12:16:28] <here4thegear> trose in your case, are you looking to return foo?
[12:16:40] <WebDragon> "h2 + (p|ul){1,}" . wrap( div/ )  in pseudo-regex
[12:16:43] <skroot> Using TinyBox2 for my modal windows. It supports iframe content. I have a form that returns whois.php with my form data. Can I open that page in the modal window?
[12:16:49] <ch3mical> sadmicrowave: did you just say that .show doesn't work on elements that are display:none?
[12:17:02] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, no i did'nt
[12:17:10] <ch3mical> sadmicrowave: oh good :)
[12:17:16] <sadmicrowave> yea :P
[12:17:32] <ch3mical> Had me worried for a sec
[12:17:37] <sadmicrowave> he was asking if the iframe would be usable if it was display:none...(he only wants it usable if he does the .show() action on it)
[12:17:48] <ch3mical> ah, gotcha
[12:17:51] <sadmicrowave> I said it would not be usable if it is display:none
[12:18:00] <ch3mical> :)
[12:18:03] <trose> here4thegear, i want an anchor that links to another page and sends a variable. The next page needs to read that variable and modify it's content accordingly.
[12:18:21] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, I'm assuming 'elm' is defined somewhere else?
[12:18:33] <ch3mical> trose: that's called php :)
[12:18:34] <roger_padactor> yeah.
[12:18:48] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, can you show that definition?
[12:19:02] <roger_padactor> the src gets printed but never changed after

[12:21:19] <ch3mical> That's hanging on my wall lol
[12:21:31] <sadmicrowave> thats f-ing awesome
[12:21:36] <ch3mical> Indeed
[12:21:41] <sadmicrowave> I want that
[12:21:44] <zmaril> Pardon me, what is a good book to learn how to speed up jquery?
[12:21:54] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, you get my last 2 messages?
[12:22:02] <sadmicrowave> jquery.com
[12:22:17] <WebDragon> be nice if I could do some sort of regular expression selection
[12:22:24] <ch3mical> zmaril: jquery is already as fast as it can be, if something is slow, something else is to blame, I assure you
[12:22:39] <sadmicrowave> ?hi5 @ ch3mical
[12:22:39] <bot-t> ch3mical, 
[12:22:47] <ch3mical> WebDragon: what for?
[12:22:51] <roger_padactor> sadmicrowave: i forgot to do src = src.replace(...);  src = was the trick :) hahaha
[12:22:59] <sadmicrowave> :)
[12:23:20] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, glad I pointed that out to you ;)
[12:23:21] <WebDragon> ch3mical: I'm trying to find a way to select several adjacent elements and wrap all of them in a single parent div
[12:23:36] <ch3mical> WebDragon: see ?.siblings
[12:23:36] <bot-t> WebDragon, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[12:24:02] <WebDragon> ch3mical: http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php example markup there
[12:24:25] <Argorok> http://www.wancorarh.com.br/spa_admin/ -> Can anyone help me with this? In the second tab: clientes, my accordion is very small, I wanna that every accordion display all content when expanded, like occurs in first tab, laboratrios. (Sorry to repost, just adding more details)
[12:24:26] <ch3mical> Yep, that's a menu
[12:24:33] <WebDragon> ch3mical: tell me if it's possible to do, with siblings() : select the h2 + either p or ul, up until either the next h2, or the end of the parent div
[12:24:43] <sadmicrowave> DELETE COOKIES?! LMAO
[12:24:52] <zmaril> ch3mical: Understood, but how can I learn not to do stupid shit with jquery that slows it down?
[12:24:55] <ch3mical> WebDragon: yes
[12:25:21] <WebDragon> ch3mical: so for example everything under the heading Salads, until Soups
[12:25:22] <ch3mical> zmaril: ahhhh. Ask the right questions.... ;) </zen master>
[12:25:34] <ch3mical> WebDragon: yes
[12:25:51] <WebDragon> ok. lemme go read and if necessary ask some better questions
[12:25:54] <WebDragon> thanks :)
[12:25:56] <ch3mical> Np
[12:26:28] <sadmicrowave> zmaril, the best way to not slow down your jquery is to know every single plugin available and utilize those correctly.  Since that is not really feasible, the alternative is to ask when you have questions and learn by trial and error
[12:26:45] <here4thegear> well if he had the right questions he'd know the answers... Professor Googall would make sure of that ;-)
[12:27:05] <sadmicrowave> zmaril, I learn about new plugins and functions everyday (or almost)
[12:27:14] <ch3mical> zmaril: I don't know of a good resource for "best practices" for writing jquery, but yeah just ask about anything specific as sadmicrowave suggests and we can help out
[12:27:30] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I'm having some trouble getting a timeout to work. Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/D65DceKx Basically, whenever I type anything in the box alert('test') instantly pops up without waiting 5 seconds like it should. Any suggestions?
[12:27:45] <ch3mical> jjb123: remove the () from the function
[12:27:54] <ch3mical> (I didn't even look at your code)
[12:28:22] <pootpoot> dont functions require () lol
[12:28:32] <ch3mical> Or, put the function call inside an anonymous function like setTimeout(function() { myFunction(); ), 2000)
[12:28:47] <ch3mical> pootpoot: only if you want it executed the second the intpreter sees it
[12:28:55] <swiggy> how do i upload a file via ajax - without using a plugin...
[12:28:57] <ch3mical> pootpoot: not if you're only referncing it
[12:29:01] <sadmicrowave> jjb123, yes, to the second thing ch3mical said
[12:29:05] <pootpoot> right
[12:29:14] <sadmicrowave> errr, the 3rd
[12:29:14] <ch3mical> referencing*
[12:29:24] <sadmicrowave> next to last?
[12:29:32] <sadmicrowave> .prev().prev().prev()
[12:29:42] <ch3mical> I put a ) instead of } in that example, btw
[12:29:45] <ch3mical> Don't do that ;)
[12:30:01] <sadmicrowave> yes, that
[12:30:19] <ch3mical> lol
[12:30:24] <sadmicrowave> :)
[12:30:45] <Assimilater> Can someone help me figure this out? http://jsfiddle.net/BU5We/2/
[12:30:50] <zmaril> Okay. I will keep that in mind then. Thank you!
[12:31:06] <jjb123> ch3mical: Remove the () from the function inside of the setTimeout?
[12:31:07] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, what's wrong?
[12:31:14] <sadmicrowave> lol
[12:31:27] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, see what you did with your sarcasm?
[12:31:58] <jjb123> ch3mical: I need to pass something to the function so how can I do that?
[12:32:07] <ch3mical> jjb123: if you were calling a function, you would leave off the (), since you are only trying to set an alert, encase it in an anonymous function
[12:32:20] <swiggy> how do i upload a file(image) via ajax - without using a plugin...
[12:32:21] <ch3mical> jjb123: in that case use an anon function
[12:32:35] <jjb123> ch3mical: Cool, thanks for your help!
[12:32:36] <sadmicrowave> jjb123, this should be your setTimeout statement: setTimeout(function() { alert('test'); }, search_interval);
[12:32:40] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: well, i want it to only be allowed to select one button
[12:32:51] <jjb123> sadmicrowave: Thanks
[12:32:52] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: and it's not ever executing the function
[12:33:07] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: and i don't want to execute that function again if they click the active button a second time
[12:33:17] <sadmicrowave> jjb123, deferring the thanks to ch3mical ( I just restated what he said )
[12:33:23] <ch3mical> And now I have to get back to work...
[12:33:36] <ch3mical> Have fun
[12:33:47] <sadmicrowave> later
[12:34:33] <cbobo> is doing if ($('#mydiv').length != 0) {  //The best way to check if an element exists ?
[12:35:09] <phlp> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/BU5We/3
[12:35:21] <sadmicrowave> cbobo, I think you can shorten that alittle more and do if( $('#mydiv').length )
[12:35:33] <cbobo> well other than that
[12:35:52] <cbobo> but, that is how we are to do it in jq right?   I can't find a special function for it
[12:36:31] <pootpoot> chobo .length is enough
[12:36:33] <Assimilater> phlp: how to make it so it doesn't set the html if they click a button twice?
[12:36:44] <cbobo> okay, changeing the code to just .length
[12:37:19] <sadmicrowave> cbobo, and yes, that is the correct way to do it in jquery. unfortunately there isn't an empty() function like php for something like this
[12:37:42] <phlp> Assimilater: you can use .change instead of .click
[12:38:19] <Assimilater> phlp: with a radio set?
[12:39:06] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, give all your inputs the same name
[12:39:12] <sadmicrowave> name='myinputs'
[12:39:56] <sadmicrowave> beautiful formating by the way...i want to barf
[12:40:39] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: um, well that's kind of html 101....there are many inputs though and doing .change() on one input, i'm not sure how that would work
[12:41:07] <sadmicrowave> helping
[12:41:39] <phlp> when the selected state changes, the change event is called. since selecting a selected radio doesnt change the selected state, nothing will happen on the second click.
[12:43:39] <sjohnson> Q: i'm converting a legacy ajax function to use jQuery.  however, in the old function, the author allowed you to specify big variables using a 'postdata' string variable.  I'm wondering it's possible to send this data in Jquery's AJAX way as well.
[12:43:41] <sjohnson> (see:  http://pastebin.com/Fzrjw5Jc)
[12:43:44] <monk12> Anyone know if the jquery ui datepicker can selectively highlight certain days? i been asked to only highlight certain days (doesn't matter if still clickable, just needs to be formatted differently.)
[12:44:47] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/BU5We/4/
[12:47:41] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: .change() appears to work, oddly enough; thanks
[12:47:49] <sadmicrowave> ok
[12:55:52] <skroot> sooo.... anyway to make my form results load to a modal window?
[12:58:42] <WebDragon> ch3mical: siblings() doesn't seem to be the immediate answer -- tried a couple variations on the filtering expression but can't seem to get what I need
[12:59:21] <WebDragon> probably easiest at this point to add wrappers to the markdown
[12:59:47] <WebDragon> I can't help but feel that there's a way to do this via jquery but I just can't figure out hwo
[12:59:49] <WebDragon> how*
[13:02:17] <phlp> WebDragon: $('h2').eq(0).nextUntil('h2')
[13:02:41] * WebDragon quickly looks up nextUntil
[13:04:14] <davidw> ok, here's an odd one.... $($('#document_content_editor').parent().find('iframe')[0]).contents()[0].find('style') ...
[13:04:27] <davidw> now when I go to set the HTML of that in IE, it barfs
[13:04:55] <skroot> the contents of the iframe are from tyher same domain, right?
[13:05:19] <WebDragon> phlp: almost, but still same problem
[13:05:50] <phlp> what's the problem?
[13:05:54] <skroot> Right now I have a form calling whois.php for it's action. How can I make that whois.php open in a modal instead?
[13:06:38] <WebDragon> phlp: problem one: it wraps each p or ul with individual divs, not the whole thing with a single div. problem two: that line only selects the first h2, but not each h2 on the page: http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php
[13:07:33] <WebDragon> instead of parentdiv( div(h2) div(p) div(ul) div(p) div(h2) div(p) div(p)) I need parentdiv( div(h2 p ul p) div(h2 p p ) )
[13:08:16] <WebDragon> if I wanted it to wrap each element, I'd expect to have to add .each() in there somewhere
[13:08:19] <WebDragon> only I don't
[13:08:26] <WebDragon> which had me headscratching for a bit
[13:09:26] <WebDragon> doesn't seem to be an .. wait, there's wrapAll
[13:09:29] <WebDragon> let me try that
[13:09:40] <davidw> skroot, yeah, same domain
[13:09:52] <davidw> I wonder if I can make a better test case....
[13:10:31] <WebDragon> phlp: ok wrapAll did what I needed, now I need it to do it for EACH section of h2's
[13:10:37] <WebDragon> not just the first one
[13:12:06] <phlp> WebDragon: $("h2").each(function() { $(this).nextUntil("h2").wrapAll("<div class='menusection' />"); });
[13:13:05] <Aristata> what are you doing jedimind?
[13:13:16] <WebDragon> phlp: will that also include the h2's at the end that are terminated by the end of the parent div ?
[13:13:20] <WebDragon> and not the next h2 ?
[13:14:50] <phlp> "If the selector is not matched or is not supplied, all following siblings will be selected" http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil
[13:14:54] <WebDragon> seems to work
[13:14:56] <WebDragon> :D
[13:15:00] <WebDragon> *whew*
[13:15:18] <phlp> it's making me hungry
[13:15:26] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee over to phlp 
[13:15:34] <WebDragon> cheers, mate
[13:15:38] <phlp> :)
[13:16:00] <WebDragon> phlp: I noticed you didn't use the eq(0) on the 2nd one
[13:16:29] <WebDragon> http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php  temporarily styled it with box-shadow inset, to highlight the fact that it was working, a little better
[13:17:26] <phlp> i only used eq(0) the first time because the nextUntil('h2') didnt seem to work if all h2 were selected, just made it select everything else
[13:19:53] <WebDragon> now comes the hard part
[13:20:00] <WebDragon> to do what the client really wanted.
[13:20:22] <phlp> flash?
[13:20:26] <WebDragon> which is, make each subsection under the h2's hidden until the h2's are clicked
[13:20:46] <WebDragon> with an icon in the h2 indicating its position and that re-clicking it will hide that section again
[13:21:26] <WebDragon> this will at least enable me to do that without having to edit the master Markdown doc with extraneous <div class="menusections"> and keep it as plain-text as possible
[13:23:17] <jstout> i have a page with some ads on it, and whenever a use clicks on an ad, the ad pops up and the next ad changes, however, i now need to add an "iframe" ad, but i can't bind a click to that iframe
[13:23:19] <jstout> how can i get around this?
[13:27:03] <Anyvie> Can you control the iframe's content ?
[13:27:16] <Anyvie> If not, there is no way (security restriction)
[13:27:24] <phlp> WebDragon: $('.menusection').hide(); $('h2').click(function() { $(this).next('.menusection').slideToggle(); });
[13:28:54] <WebDragon> phlp: .menusection.hide won't work since they aren't live in the document at the time the first script runs :) had to add display: none to the css instead
[13:29:21] <WebDragon> $("h2").each( function () { $(this).nextUntil("h2").wrapAll("<div class='menusection' />") }).stop().live('click', function () { $(this).next(".menusection").toggle('slow'); });
[13:29:25] <WebDragon> more or less did it like that
[13:31:13] <phlp> WebDragon: should give .menucontents p margin-right:60px so the prices dont cut off the border
[13:31:37] <WebDragon> eh, the border was there just to make sure the wrappers were working so I could see it visually
[13:31:45] <WebDragon> I'm removing them and just slide-showing the contents
[13:31:58] <WebDragon> now i just gotta add the visible switch to the h2's so the icon reflects the state of the menus
[13:32:34] <WebDragon> phlp: http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php  there
[13:33:06] <Anyvie> Yeah, it's nice ! <3
[13:33:23] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey when i add mouse events to an element. which variable should I be using to to get the click coordinates? layerX, offsetX, etc?
[13:34:51] <erichynds> offsetX/Y will give you the mouse coords relative to the elem
[13:35:05] <erichynds> pageX/Y is mouse coords relative to doc
[13:35:06] <Anyvie> event.pageX / event.pageY ?
[13:37:26] <ElCapitanMarklar> hmm im having some issues with the offsetX in firefox
[13:37:42] <ElCapitanMarklar> its just undefined
[13:39:34] <skroot> so this is dumb
[13:39:46] <skroot> what is the point of an ajax call if you have to hardcode the post data anyway?
[13:39:56] <WebDragon> whoops, .stop() should have been .end()
[13:39:58] <skroot> cant i make an ajax call using text that has been entered into a text box instead?
[13:40:10] <erichynds> skroot: $("form").serialize()
[13:40:28] <erichynds> $.get("/foo/'", $(form).serialize(), function(){});
[13:40:39] <skroot> hrmmm
[13:40:43] <skroot> ill explain further
[13:40:46] <skroot> im using TinyBox2
[13:40:52] <skroot> and im opening my form requests in the modal window
[13:40:55] <skroot> to do so, im doing this:
[13:41:01] <skroot> 					<form method="get" onsubmit="TINY.box.show({url:'whois.php',post:'domain=webdrafter.com',width:750,height:450,maskid:'blackmask',maskopacity:40});return false;">
[13:41:17] <skroot> but where it says domain=webdrafter.com, i want that to be domain=WHATEVER I TYPE IN THE TEXT BOX
[13:41:32] <skroot> i can PM you a working link if youd like
[13:42:39] <erichynds> that's ok
[13:42:40] <erichynds> i have no idea
[13:42:41] <test> hello
[13:42:43] <Itrace> When using $.getJSON I'm getting an error response that I can see in the net console of FireBug. But, the error callback function is not doing anything. Is there a reason for that? Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/pucTQ/
[13:42:46] <erichynds> i know nothing about tinybox
[13:43:04] <skroot> no problem
[13:43:05] <erichynds> but in the submit handler, you can just grab the value of the box
[13:43:09] <erichynds> instead of hard coding it
[13:43:16] <jorenl_> Hi everyone! I have a jquery draggable. Once it is being dragged, I'd like it not to be positioned relative to its original container because the container is moving. is that possible?
[13:43:19] <skroot> i dont have a submit handler
[13:43:23] <Argorok> http://www.wancorarh.com.br/spa_admin/ -> Can anyone help me with this? In the second tab: clientes, my accordion is very small, I wanna that every accordion display all content when expanded, like occurs in first tab, laboratrios. (Sorry to repost, just adding more details)
[13:43:23] <test> does anyone knows how to do bubble count list `with jquery.    not mobile
[13:43:28] <erichynds> that's what onsubmit= is
[13:43:33] <skroot> oh, heh
[13:43:35] <skroot> my fault
[13:43:42] <djQuery> whats the difference betwen offset and position in the callback for ui.draggable stop
[13:43:43] <skroot> i was thinking a submit fuction to sanitize data, etc
[13:43:51] <skroot> position is the starting position
[13:43:56] <erichynds> that would definitely be preferred
[13:43:56] <skroot> offset is the distance from that position
[13:44:25] <djQuery> skroot: originalPosition is the starting position
[13:44:49] <skroot> ok. then i take that back.
[13:45:16] <djQuery> skroot: :) looking at the console.log of ui in the callback right now
[13:45:33] <skroot> erichynds, can i just use a JS variable in my submit handler and then use jquery to update that JS variable?
[13:46:31] <djQuery>  skroot: are u using jquery ui at all?
[13:47:14] <djQuery> nevermind I see your form code.
[13:47:31] <Anyvie> Itrace> You have a cross-domain security problem
[13:48:12] <skroot> dj, i use UI very limitedly in other applications
[13:48:39] <Anyvie> HA
[13:48:51] <Anyvie> Itrace> try replace "username" by YOUR username x)
[13:50:30] <Itrace> anyvie: Sorry. I added in a fake username when I created that JSfiddle. That code will work with the proper username. My question is about the callback error function. It isn't working as expected.
[13:50:49] <Anyvie> Then, oh
[13:51:04] <Anyvie> Because that's not an Ajax Error
[13:51:21] <Anyvie> item.text.linkify() <-- linkify doesn't work for me
[13:51:49] <tdignan> How does jquery.post() send the [data,] parameter? as JSON?
[13:52:10] <Anyvie> But as it's not a problem while getting the data, call to error function is not made.
[13:52:32] <Itrace> anyvie: ...yeah... linkify() is a function that I didn't include in that example. I really only shared the example so that you could see how my error callback function was created.
[13:52:46] <Anyvie> I see.
[13:53:01] <tdignan> Oh. I think I need JSON.stringify
[13:53:08] <djQuery> skroot: see ?demo
[13:53:08] <bot-t> skroot, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:53:16] <Anyvie> But, on my page, I don't have error if I just cut this function
[13:53:34] <Argorok> http://www.wancorarh.com.br/spa_admin/ -> Can anyone help me with this? In the second tab: clientes, my accordion is very small, I wanna that every accordion display all content when expanded, like occurs in first tab, laboratrios.
[13:54:05] <Itrace> See. Twitter allows you to use their API only X number of times after that it spits back an error. My question is: If im getting back an error why won't the error function fire?
[13:54:45] <djQuery> Itrace: is it a http error or a http success with a custom error prop
[13:55:14] <Itrace> anyvie: Interesting.
[13:56:32] <Anyvie> Yeah, I understood. I'm looking at the way to do that
[13:56:57] <davidw> There we go: weird IE/iframe/jquery/ckeditor issue described with code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6822240/access-ckeditor-iframes-style-tags-with-jquery
[13:58:14] <jp-> i'm generating a dialog on the fly, in the close event i'm calling destroy and removing it: $(dlg).dialog('destroy'); $(document).remove(dlg); I get an error in the error in the javascript console: c.replace is not a function. is there some other way i'm supposed to completely destroy and remove the associated nodes used for the dialog from the dom?
[13:58:46] <Anyvie> Itrace, what is your error, exactly ?
[13:59:23] <Anyvie> I uncommented your alerts, and I got the success one, and I can't reproduce an error :(
[13:59:48] <Itrace> anyvie: one sec
[14:01:04] <Itrace> Here's what I'm getting in the response: jQuery15102718023758978382_1311627567895({"error":"Rate limit exceeded.

[14:01:35] <Itrace> anyvie: It's a 400 Bad Request
[14:01:36] <Anyvie> ok
[14:02:14] <Itrace> I'm viewing this in FireFox 5
[14:03:08] <Anyvie> Maybe, before your $.each, you can do something like : if (data.error != undefined) { alert("too bad :'("); }
[14:03:30] <Itrace> I'll give it a try.
[14:04:58] <pst9er> trying to use .ajax() to send an object with entries like "foo[bar][blah]" => 'abc'. on the receiving end, $_POST is getting the data as "foo[bar" -- is there some special way I need to be handling square brackets in the data argument?

[14:10:23] <Camer0n> hi, i dont really understand jquery, I'm trying to use ajax but this isn't working: http://pastebin.com/HK8BMFeB
[14:10:38] <Camer0n> the msg-read.php file works
[14:10:44] <Camer0n> its just the jquery
[14:11:17] <Anyvie> the URL in Ajax show a MySQL error
[14:12:08] <Camer0n> no
[14:12:19] <Camer0n> the url works fine
[14:12:28] <Camer0n> the mysql works fine*
[14:12:31] <Anyvie> http://spareslist.com/ajax/msg-read.php <-- You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 1
[14:13:19] <Anyvie> If (!isset($_GET['id'])) { exit; }
[14:13:28] <Anyvie> Just add this.
[14:13:29] <Camer0n> ok fine
[14:13:47] <Anyvie> so, you want to grab data ?
[14:13:53] <Camer0n> but the jquery will have an id all the time
[14:13:58] <Camer0n> no i want to update data
[14:14:01] <Anyvie> ok
[14:14:10] <Marius0188> Good day all. I am pretty new to jQuery. Who can pop me a quick example for the following: I am displaying lines from a mysql table. On each line (item) I have a "Add to List" link. When clicking this link I need to call a php script that will save all lists to a session variable. I believe jQuery is the way to achieve this.
[14:14:12] <Anyvie> First, you have to think that some people will try everything
[14:14:13] <Camer0n> when you click it it updates the post to say its been read
[14:14:19] <Camer0n> yeah i know
[14:14:29] <Anyvie> ok
[14:14:52] <Anyvie> so, if I'm using msg-read.php?id=1, it will auto-update ?
[14:14:55] <magcius> you know what would be cool?
[14:14:59] <Camer0n> yes
[14:15:07] <Anyvie> So, you just don't want do to anything else
[14:15:15] <magcius> .data() triggering "changed" events
[14:15:20] <magcius> so you can tell when a value is changed
[14:15:26] <Camer0n> when i click the javascript link it goes to that page
[14:15:27] <Camer0n> yeah
[14:15:56] <Anyvie> $.get('http://spareslist.com/ajax/msg-read.php?id='+msgid);
[14:16:24] <CodeZombie> would someone mind taking a look at this bind? For some reason the events won't fire. https://gist.github.com/d70e5266976d3daa213c
[14:16:33] <CodeZombie> in FF, Chrome, and Safari
[14:16:39] <CodeZombie> all latest versions
[14:17:13] <Camer0n> nah, that doesnt work :/
[14:18:36] <Anyvie> ho
[14:18:39] <Anyvie> strip the "(" ")"
[14:18:53] <Camer0n> what do you mean?
[14:18:58] <Camer0n> where?
[14:19:00] <Anyvie> (function ... )
[14:19:15] <Anyvie> (I'm on message.php)
[14:19:17] <Anyvie> s
[14:19:54] <Camer0n> :/
[14:20:00] <CodeZombie> nvm, got it
[14:20:11] <Camer0n> what?? there isnt a (function)
[14:20:56] <Anyvie> ok, so
[14:21:07] <Anyvie> just before the $.get, try some alert(msgid);
[14:21:50] <Camer0n> mhm, that works
[14:21:55] <Anyvie> ok
[14:22:50] <Anyvie> hum.

[14:28:10] <Camer0n> get
[14:28:32] <Anyvie> ok
[14:28:49] <Anyvie> so, I manually go to the ajax page, with id=1, and nothing visible on my side, on messages.php
[14:29:23] <Anyvie> Could you show some read info on the page, temporary ?
[14:29:36] <Anyvie> Then, we'll see if changes are done
[14:29:59] <Camer0n> done
[14:30:05] <mehale> after I issue a $(form input).change(), can I cancel it?
[14:31:54] <Camer0n> 1 sec, i'll brb
[14:33:51] <janthony> Is there way to get .animate() to trigger on mouse click and then stop animating when the mouse is unclicked?
[14:34:38] <fris> unbind ?
[14:35:01] <ngharo> ?stop @ janthony
[14:35:01] <Anyvie> you mean, all the time the mouse button is down, the animate is ON, and when the button is up, the animate is OFF ?
[14:35:02] <bot-t> janthony, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:35:15] <janthony> Anyvie: Correct
[14:35:36] <_ramo> hi
[14:36:04] <janthony> Anyvie: Or also be able to do it with hover, so when you're hovered the animation is running, when you hover off, the animation stops, even if it wasn't complete.
[14:36:06] <Anyvie> mousedown : animate
[14:36:08] <Anyvie> mouseup : stop

[15:59:23] <chris_st> Hello... got a bunch of .sortable() objects, identified by class, not ID.  They work (HURRAY!) but I want to do the '.serialize' thing on them.  ALL the examples I can find say do $("#id_o_widget").serialize(); but I don't have the ID... is there a way to use either of the "ui" or "event" variables handed to the "update" method to get the object getting the message?
[16:00:14] <djQuery> chris_st: you could just do a loop over them and get genereate your own array
[16:00:35] <djQuery> chris_st: probably easier than anything else
[16:00:53] <chris_st> djQuery: Sorry to be clueless :-) but how would I know which array element to use?
[16:02:38] <djQuery> chris_st: you dont know what u called sortable on?
[16:02:51] <djQuery> it would be the child elements of that
[16:04:33] <chris_st> I have a bunch of lists, all with class ".mysortable".  So I do a $(".mysortable").sortable(); and bingo, they're sortable... BUT, I don't know *which* individual list I've got in the "update" method.  Make sense?  The lists are generated programmatically, and I *could* give each one an ID and its own binding, but that seems... inelegant.  I'd *think* there'd be a way to discover, in "update", which one is the target... right?
[16:04:43] <solidus-river> djQuery: from within my widgit class, this.element.data(OBJECT) and this.data(OBJECT) yields, no defined method data
[16:05:22] <djQuery> solidus-river: are u using the ui widget factory for a plugin?
[16:05:55] <solidus-river> djQuery: i'm declairing my widget, $.widget('ui.user', {blah});
[16:06:14] <solidus-river> and in my code i'm doing $('div').user();
[16:06:15] <djQuery> solidus-river: ok so it is the widget factory
[16:06:30] <solidus-river> djQuery: is there a different method for storing data using the widget factory?
[16:06:48] <djQuery> solidus-river: have you gone through this? http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[16:09:30] <djQuery> solidus-river: and for the most part the widget will automaticaly store its data if you follow the pattern correctly
[16:10:06] <mrevd> hey all, how can I sort a json object by date when in this format? 01:20pm | 02.12.11
[16:10:09] <solidus-river> djQuery: i'm reading, so i should creation an options part of the widget so i can do $('#div').data('widgetname').options.value?
[16:11:06] <djQuery> do it right and you wouldnt even need to do that.
[16:11:17] <solidus-river> djQuery: i'm confused as to what "do it right" means
[16:11:40] <solidus-river> djQuery: i'm reading those slides and its all making sense, but i still dont see a good way of storing data with a wiget and accessing it externally, i'm on slide 20
[16:12:16] <djQuery> $('#whatever').mywidget('option', 'optionname') would return the option and $('#whatever').mywidget('option', 'optionname', value) would set the option
[16:13:00] <djQuery> solidus-river: provide a correctly defined _setOption(key, value) and _setOptions(options)
[16:13:26] <solidus-river> so from within then i can do this._setOption(....) and a this._getOption?
[16:13:37] <solidus-river> how would i refernce those options from within it then?
[16:14:31] <djQuery> typicaly no you dont need to in the start of each function I usualy have $this = $(this), options = this.options
[16:15:03] <djQuery> ?src ui.dialog
[16:15:04] <bot-t> (Result for '.') Line#17 - "var document = window.document;" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#17
[16:15:20] <solidus-river> djQuery: is there something different than t = this, vs this = $(this)?
[16:15:35] <solidus-river> untill now i've been using this = this, and then this.element etc
[16:16:19] <djQuery> solidus-river: t is not a jquery object where $t = $(this) would be
[16:16:55] <solidus-river> djQuery: whats the advantage fo using jquery objects vs variables
[16:17:35] <djQuery> solidus-river: look how they refer to options in the ui.dialog widget https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L82
[16:17:56] <ajpiano> solidus-river: that's like comparing apples to "fruit"
[16:17:58] <ajpiano> everything is variables
[16:18:44] <djQuery> solidus-river: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L515
[16:21:04] <solidus-river> ok its making more sense now
[16:21:33] <chris_st> Cool, figured it out: Turns out you can do $(this).sortable("serialize");
[16:21:34] <solidus-river> so why would i want to override the _setOption or _setOptions methods, shouldn't i just rely on the base _setOption method as long as i'm not doing anything particulary fancy with them
[16:21:47] <chris_st> jQuery is pure, distilled awesomeness :-)
[16:21:56] <chris_st> (Or it is, once you figure it out!)
[16:25:54] <djQuery> solidus-river: incase you need to do anythign when an option changes
[16:26:06] <tdignan> I want to use the form validation plugin to validate a "form" which doesn't actually have a submit button. I took the submit out and replaced it with a normal button because it was forcing me to actually submit (i.e. use get/post) when I wanted to actually take the values and use them for an http request of my own, written in js.
[16:26:20] <tdignan> How can I accomplish using the form validation plugin without having to perform an actual submit?
[16:27:19] <djQuery> tdignan: how do plan on knowing when its safe to submit. ie the user is finished entering data?
[16:27:37] <tdignan> they click a button
[16:27:50] <solidus-river> djQuery: so from within a widget i can do this.options.whatever to set or get an option, outside i can do $('div').widgetclassname('option', 'optionname') or the same with a third argument to get names
[16:28:04] <tdignan> then in the button's click event, I take the form values.
[16:28:16] <djQuery> tdignan: have you looked at this? http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[16:28:55] <tdignan> cool
[16:29:01] <tdignan> so it's a magic ajaxifier?
[16:29:40] <djQuery> $('#mysubmit').click(function(){   var x = $(this).closest('form').serialize();   $.post('myurl', x, successfunction)})
[16:30:22] <djQuery> tdignan: ^^
[16:30:28] <tdignan> everything checks out except I need to turn my form into a JSON string which i already wrote a function to create
[16:30:38] <tdignan> and then that gets posted, in the payload, raw json
[16:30:57] <solidus-river> djQuery: thank you so much for putting up with me through that, i'm pretty new to jQuery and that was a lot of behind the scenes work with OOP that i'm not used to bieng there in javascript
[16:30:59] <djQuery> tdignan: lol before you keep your function have you looked at see ?.serialize
[16:30:59] <bot-t> tdignan, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[16:31:38] <tdignan> yeah djQuery serialize is not what I need
[16:31:44] <djQuery> solidus-river: have only been doing it a couple hours myself
[16:32:06] <tdignan> looks like i just replace x with my stuff, though
[16:32:08] <tdignan> the rest makes sense
[16:32:26] <tdignan> i am doing things a bit unconventionally
[16:32:26] <djQuery> tdignan: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#validation
[16:32:31] <ajpiano> tdignan: you could have used serializeObject plugin ans JSON stringify
[16:32:40] <ajpiano> ?g serializeObject
[16:32:41] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery serializeObject | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-serializeobject-plugin
[16:32:58] <ajpiano> JSON.stringify($("#someForm").serializeObject());
[16:33:21] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/evuxav/27/edit
[16:33:38] <djQuery> this is causing me all sorts of problems
[16:34:34] <tdignan> ajpiano: it's a good tip, thanks
[16:34:47] <tdignan> I don't know if I can fit that in, because I call a sha256 hash function on my password field first
[16:34:50] <tdignan> heh
[16:38:18] <solidus-river> djQuery: amazing :) this is so nice, its like a javascript implimentation of qt, i have my signals slots and public data
[16:38:42] <djQuery> que?
[16:39:23] <solidus-river> djQuery: the way jQuery ui.widget is laid out is really similar to qt (cross platform c++ / python ui api from trolltech / nokia)
[16:45:27] <sjohnson> Q: in the jQuery AJAX code, is it possible to set an attribute so that it does not do more than 1 async requests at a time?
[16:47:18] <sjohnson> i was able to do it with the legacy code using this oneliner:  if (typeof(ajaxRequest)=='object' && ajaxRequest!=null) ajaxRequest.abort();
[16:47:36] <sjohnson> but nothing on the jquery website is sticking out at me.  any help / tips greatly appeciated.  thanks
[16:48:10] <sjohnson> (ajaxRequest simply being an object of the XMLHttpRequest class)
[16:54:51] <coldhead> sjohnson: have a look at the jQuery ajax queue plugins
[16:54:59] <coldhead> i bet one or more of them have that feature
[16:56:36] <sjohnson> coldhead: will do, thanks
[16:57:36] <jahc> How to find all checkboxes that are ticked, and then display their ID in an alert() ?
[16:59:50] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/evuxav/28/edit
[17:00:04] <djQuery> cant figure out why I am getting the errpr

[17:17:21] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm having a problem with a simple element not being "pushed" by another element using slideToggle in IE7 only.  Advice?  http://www.systhermique.com/test-en/faq/
[17:18:03] <MarcGuay> Seems like parts of the div get moved (the border goes) but not the rest...
[17:23:08] <djQuery> coldhead: yeah I cant undertand wy the first one would work and not the 2nd
[17:23:27] <djQuery> coldhead: if I just put the 1st in there twice it works find
[17:23:31] <djQuery> ^fine
[17:41:33] <redbranch> hi is there a function to repeat a piece of code every 10 seconds?
[17:42:08] <redbranch> $("#insert).repeat(500).load("script.php").fadeIn(400); kinda?
[17:43:46] <MarcGuay> redbranch:  You're looking for... setInterval() i think, a core javascript function.
[17:44:08] <redbranch> setinterval ok ill go look it up
[17:44:34] <coldhead> ?mdc setinterval
[17:44:39] <bot-t> coldhead, window.setInterval - MDN Docs - Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/window.setInterval
[17:44:43] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[17:44:44] <bot-t> ;)
[17:45:05] <redbranch> oh that worked a treat ty
[17:46:37] <redbranch>  setInterval(function() {             somecode }, 2000}; ever 2 secs
[17:50:39] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm having a problem with a simple element not being "pushed" by another element using slideToggle in IE7 only.  Advice?  http://www.systhermique.com/test-en/faq/
[17:51:42] <coldhead> ?g setinterval harmful zetafleet @ redbranch
[17:51:43] <bot-t> redbranch, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[17:51:49] <MarcGuay> If I go in and inspect with "developer tools" and toggle the display variable, it works.  So basically, it should work, but IE is being bitchy.
[17:51:59] <coldhead> there is an interesting alternative pattern in that link with some rationale for using it, redbranch
[17:52:37] <coldhead> MarcGuay: it's probably to do with position:absolute vs relative or display:inline vs block or some combination thereof
[17:56:26] <MarcGuay> coldhead: The worst part is that it's working locally, but when I put it up inside the Wordpress page it starts acting crappy.
[17:56:27] <K1ng> freelancer.com stole my $1000 USD.
[17:57:12] <coldhead> oh man wordpress is a hard battle, i'm sorry

[17:59:15] <madprops> how can I turn this $("iframe[src^='http://www.youtube.com']"), to match only videos inside a certain element?
[18:00:48] <coldhead> $("div.somekindofclass iframe[src^='http://www.youtube.com']")

[18:08:08] <d4rklit3> hey
[18:08:12] <d4rklit3> when i use $.get
[18:08:17] <d4rklit3> it seems to reorder my json
[18:09:17] <d4rklit3> like it in php i use uasort() to sort the array im spitting out (indexed array) and then when it gets into the jquery its all in its original order
[18:10:00] <KingTarquin> Is there a way to link to a tab using jQuery UI Tabs that use ajax?
[18:11:00] <madprops> coldhead, cool thanks
[18:12:12] <coldhead> i seem to recall it can be done with #hash_fragments, KingTarquin
[18:12:36] <coldhead> d4rklit3: i'm not sure JSON is ordered, officially
[18:12:55] <KingTarquin> I've tried a couple of things that way, but I can't seem to get it to work.
[18:13:32] <d4rklit3> was using wrong sorter
[18:13:34] <d4rklit3> usort()
[18:16:01] <KingTarquin> Hmm.. It doesn't work when I add the #hash_fragment to the url and hit enter, but it works when I refresh the page with the #hash_fragment in the url.
[18:18:25] <lazarus477> Is there some sort of listing of plugins which offers filtering so I only get a listing of GPL licensed plugins?
[18:22:17] <coldhead> KingTarquin: that's a browser issue, when you hit enter it just tries to move to that fragment in the page. the code to detect and load the #fragment only happens at pageload
[18:22:43] <coldhead> you need to use ben alman's bbq plugin or similar to catch a hash change
[18:31:36] <Assimilater> hey, i'm having real problems with this page in a lot of aspects, would anyone be willing to assist me in figuring out these issues? to start with if you click on list generator, you see a table with some selects and it appears my AddRow function is not adding an event to them: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:90/index.php?action=Contacts
[18:31:39] <Assimilater> oops
[18:31:43] <Assimilater> http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/index.php?action=Contacts
[18:31:48] <Assimilater> wrong port :S
[18:32:45] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:32:51] <lenswipe> anyone in here use the jquery adapter for ckeditor?
[18:32:56] <lenswipe> DarkHouse, you around?
[18:33:09] <Assimilater> lol, i would if i could get it to work, haha
[18:33:23] <Assimilater> meh, i kind of got it to work
[18:33:30] <lenswipe> hmm
[18:33:30] <Assimilater> lenswipe: what do you need?
[18:34:17] <lenswipe> im trying to set some options for it from inside <head>
[18:34:31] <Assimilater> options meaning...
[18:34:48] <lenswipe> config options
[18:35:03] <lenswipe> id love to show you, but chrome web inspector is being a dick and wont let me copy and paste
[18:35:05] <Assimilater> "be specific bob" You trying to set a toolbar?
[18:35:27] <lenswipe> im trying to set the body stylesheet
[18:35:48] <lenswipe> i cant do it in config.js because i need to dynamically insert the URL so it works on my dev and production bo
[18:35:49] <lenswipe> box*
[18:36:14] <lenswipe> meaning i need to do it with PHP, meaning i need to do it in a PHP file, therefore doing it inside <head> would be really neat :p
[18:37:10] <Assimilater> afaik it *has* to be in config.js ...
[18:37:19] <lenswipe> thats retarded
[18:37:43] <Assimilater> meh, i've been trying to migrate to tinycme because i got sick of ckeditor :P
[18:37:48] <lenswipe> hmm
[18:43:13] <djQuery> lenswipe: u still foolin with that?
[18:43:52] <magcius> so I do ".addClass" and then try to measure things (border width, etc.) but I get wrong values
[18:44:19] <magcius> as in, old values
[18:44:37] <magcius> is there an event that I can bind to that will tell me when the new values are installed?
[18:44:44] <djQuery> Assimilater: dang that runs slow on my machine
[18:45:08] <Assimilater> djQuery: i did ... something in trying to change the editor that i haven't been able to reverse
[18:45:13] <Assimilater> djQuery: it's gotten really buggy
[18:45:19] * coldhead np: pixies - hey (bbc peel sessions)
[18:48:35] <Assimilater> holy crap, line 47: .attr("dir", asc ? "ASC" : " DESC"); instead of .attr("dir", asc ? "ASC" : "DESC"); screwed the whole thing up
[18:49:00] <Assimilater> js scares me sometimes....an error in one spot can start errors in totally unrelated places....
[18:49:42] <coldhead> i don't see the difference
[18:50:00] <magcius> " DESC"
[18:50:24] <coldhead> .attr("dir", asc ? "ASC" : " DESC");
[18:50:27] <coldhead> .attr("dir", asc ? "ASC" : "DESC");
[18:50:37] <coldhead> oh right
[18:50:50] <coldhead> Assimilater: that's true with any complex system
[18:51:31] <coldhead> i got burned yesterday because i dared to use a variable called $url when someone else was relying on that variable in one of the 1000 other files in the site
[18:51:39] <Assimilater> coldhead: but the one is unrelated to the other...
[18:51:46] <Assimilater> coldhead: that's different, there's a connection at $url
[18:52:07] <Assimilater> i mean those buttons that you click to change the arrow are supposed to be unrelated to the selects in the list generator
[18:52:18] <Assimilater> there is literally no rational connection i can come up with
[18:52:23] <coldhead> it's not so different, the DOM is like a giant namespace
[19:09:21] <Assimilater> problem number two (http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/index.php?action=Contacts) the text editor appears to be interfering with my .sortDir buttons
[19:16:38] <Zackington> heyyy
[19:18:44] <Zackington> hey tophen :)
[19:20:22] <coldhead> Tophen and zackington have the same IP
[19:20:24] <coldhead> HMM
[19:20:43] <coldhead> GREETINGS, WEB CLIENT USER
[19:20:46] <Tophen> I wonder :)
[19:22:22] <solidus-river> if i'm using the ui.widget jQuery structure, how do i call a function of another widget?
[19:24:38] <gnarf> solidus-river: mind explaining a bit more?
[19:25:30] <gnarf> my offhanded comment is "the same way you normally would"
[19:27:07] <solidus-river> gnarf: yeah, a closer look at the code and I had misnamed my anchor class in my code, it sworking now :\
[19:30:02] <Assimilater> http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/index.php?action=Contacts the text editor appears to be interfering with my .sortDir buttons, can anyone figure out how?
[19:30:56] <Zackington> ahhh no :3
[19:33:37] <coldhead> no u
[19:33:44] <tdignan> is it *bad* to write an entire frontend in one index.html file?
[19:33:58] <coldhead> no, it's a single page app!
[19:34:06] <tdignan> awesome
[19:37:21] <lenswipe> djQuery, oh hey
[19:37:23] <lenswipe> djQuery, yes

[19:40:13] <coldhead> have a beer
[19:47:50] <madprops> any idea why the left and right arrows are not triggering? http://dpaste.com/577961/  enter works fine
[19:48:01] <tdignan> How can I maintain state between page refreshes in my one page app? Do I need to use a cookie?
[19:48:12] <tdignan> right now when I hit refresh I start over at the beginning.
[19:49:08] <coldhead> cookie or the #hash part of the URL
[19:49:33] <lenswipe> djQuery, poke
[19:49:41] <coldhead> or for true hipness: http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html
[19:49:48] <coldhead> LIKE A BOSS
[19:50:09] <djQuery> lenswipe: go poke yourself
[19:50:27] <lenswipe> djQuery, i did about half an hour ago - it was wonderful ;)

[19:51:13] <coldhead> welcome to the future, tdignan!
[19:51:15] <coldhead> good luck
[19:51:23] <crankharder> is there any reason why having 2 autocomplete fields on one page should be a problem?

[19:53:04] <magcius> can someone help me figure out how to stop transitions from happening
[19:53:15] <magcius> and additionally why it doesn't pick up the border-left/border-right values?
[19:53:48] <lenswipe> djQuery, so yeah im trying to set config options after i call the jquery adapter thingy, and its not working, want a pastebin>?
[19:54:32] <djQuery> lenswipe: its been like 2 years since I used the fckeditor and I have never used the adaptor thingh
[19:55:46] <lenswipe> djQuery, can i pastebin anyay incase you can spot anything>
[19:55:51] <lenswipe> unless anyone else knows?
[19:56:06] <djQuery> why not just link to ur site again
[19:56:15] <lenswipe> because its in the admin panel
[19:56:37] <EgoAleSum> hello
[19:56:42] <djQuery> and pastebind sucks use jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com if you have to
[19:56:49] <lenswipe> why?
[19:56:52] <lenswipe> hmm
[19:56:54] <lenswipe> hmmph
[19:57:12] <djQuery> casue with jsbin or jsfiddle you can do this http://jsbin.com/evuxav/32/edit
[19:57:25] <EgoAleSum> Is there any article about using "ui-state-error" et similia to stylish custom, static content? we would like to use jqueryui's powerful css framework for our layout too, to keep consistency...
[19:57:59] <djQuery> EgoAleSum: what do you want in the article
[19:58:27] <djQuery> you have an error and you want to call attention to it apply ui-state-error and ui-state-errortext to it
[19:58:41] <EgoAleSum> djQuery: some examples :) for example, like this http://ericdotnet.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/jquery-ui-helper/ but this is outdated and the result is not the same as in jquery ui example page (e.g. http://www.soredex.com/index.html )
[19:59:38] <djQuery> EgoAleSum: its just a css class that applies a red border (baded on the theme)
[19:59:49] <EgoAleSum> djQuery: and what for the red background?
[20:00:04] <EgoAleSum> ui-state-error for me is working (applies the red border), but not the red background
[20:00:08] <djQuery> ui-state-errortext i beleive
[20:00:08] <EgoAleSum> and does not stylize the text
[20:00:19] <EgoAleSum> nope, ui-state-errortext doesn't change anything...
[20:01:47] <EgoAleSum> djQuery oh wait that's working :) it's just the theme we're using that doesn't have a red background
[20:01:48] <EgoAleSum> sorry
[20:01:54] <EgoAleSum> my fault
[20:02:33] <djQuery> EgoAleSum: .ui-state-error-text:An additional class that applies just the error text color without background. Can be used on form labels for instance. Also applies error icon color to child icons.

[20:07:22] <solidus-river> GAH, i'm going crazy trying to populate form fields on show from json data
[20:07:25] <solidus-river> i have the div that the form is in
[20:07:27] <solidus-river> however
[20:07:56] <solidus-river> $('input[name=user_name]', some_parent_div_element).text('HELLO WORLD');
[20:08:00] <solidus-river> is giving me nothing
[20:08:40] * magcius sighs
[20:08:49] * magcius files a new jQuery bug
[20:10:19] <K1ng> can anyone help me with this?
[20:10:27] <K1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/2zA99/
[20:10:54] <K1ng> i want to get <option>'s ref
[20:14:49] <K1ng> anyone?
[20:15:17] <djQuery> well (this) aint gonna do anything. its $(this)
[20:15:30] * lenswipe throws tylenol at #jquery
[20:15:33] <djQuery> and $(this) would be the select nto the selected option
[20:15:43] <K1ng> oops sorry.
[20:16:06] <K1ng> djQuery, then how should i do it?
[20:17:13] <djQuery> K1ng: http://jsfiddle.net/2zA99/2/
[20:17:38] <djQuery> the selected didnt have a href attribute
[20:17:38] <K1ng> cool.
[20:18:00] <djQuery> and why not use a valid attribute of an option like value
[20:18:24] <djQuery> K1ng: ^
[20:18:51] <K1ng> value will be used on something.. so i cant use it. is there any valid attritube? that i can use
[20:18:56] <solidus-river> fuuuuuuuck, how do i get a form and the form elements this si driving me up the wall
[20:19:28] <solidus-river> $('form[name=my_form_name]', $('parent_div')), does not work
[20:19:29] <djQuery> K1ng: well it will work the way you are doing it but if you want it to check ok try using data-price="20"
[20:19:31] <solidus-river> why doesn't hta work
[20:20:12] <djQuery> $('form[name="my_form_name"]'
[20:20:18] <djQuery> solidus-river: ^^
[20:20:24] <K1ng> djQuery, so data-price is valid attr?
[20:20:48] <K1ng> http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_option.asp
[20:20:52] <djQuery> ?g html5 data attribute @ K1ng
[20:20:53] <bot-t> K1ng, John Resig - HTML 5 data- Attributes - http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[20:21:20] <K1ng> my client gave me xhtml form.
[20:21:25] <solidus-river> djQuery: thats not working either
[20:21:29] <djQuery> K1ng: data- anything is a valid attrubute in html5   well almost anything wouldnt use special characters
[20:22:32] <djQuery> solidus-river: why do you want to use a context that way?   $('.parent_div').find('form[name="whatever"]')
[20:23:11] <djQuery> and were you realy doing $('parent_div')  so you have an ELEMENT type parent_div?
[20:23:26] <solidus-river> djQuery: yes i was but the find works!
[20:24:35] <djQuery> solidus-river: I typicaly only do the context method when I have a cached var to pass it not when I am searching to start with.
[20:24:53] <djQuery> solidus-river: and I find the .find or .children easier to read myself
[20:26:07] <djQuery> solidus-river: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[20:28:20] <solidus-river> djQuery: is there some special method to set the text in a text field thats not just $('text field').text('text to put in it'); i notice you get the value by .val()
[20:30:35] <solidus-river> scrubbing api, i think i found it actually
[20:31:56] <solidus-river> yeah got it
[20:34:57] <Mannequin> hi. On an inherited code, there are a few of this:
[20:35:02] <Mannequin> $target = $('#some_id');
[20:35:07] <Mannequin> if ($target.is('*')) {...}
[20:35:29] <Mannequin> or, alternatively,
[20:35:32] <Mannequin> if (!$target.is('*')) {...}
[20:35:47] <Mannequin> I wonder if there is a nicer way to test if some jQuery set is empty
[20:36:12] <Mannequin> jQuery.isEmptyObject() doesn't seem the one I'm looking for
[20:45:34] <djQuery> solidus-river: well .val is a getter setter meaning .val() gets .val('something') sets the value
[20:46:01] <djQuery> Mannequin: .length
[20:46:32] <Mannequin> djQuery: thanks.
[20:46:52] <djQuery> Mannequin: covered in chap2 of this see ?jqf
[20:46:52] <bot-t> Mannequin, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[20:47:10] <solidus-river> djQuery: this doesnt make sense,in one of my functions, this.options.persona is an object, yet when i call another function later, this.options.persona is undefined
[20:47:24] <solidus-river> both functions are in the same widget class
[20:51:36] <solidus-river> grrr
[20:51:55] <solidus-river> why is this such a black box still to me
[20:52:27] <solidus-river> this == pointer to my widget class, this.options = pointer to options object, this.options.persona = data with tag 'persona' in the options object
[20:53:07] <solidus-river> however, in a fucntion called earlier... this.options.persona === object, however, a later call to a class function, this.options.persona === undefined
[20:53:11] * solidus-river pulls his hair out
[20:54:50] <solidus-river> this is the most infuriating bug i think i've ever encountered
[20:55:06] <TeddyMurray> anyone here familiar with fancybox?
[20:55:09] <TeddyMurray> its not working in IE9
[20:55:13] <solidus-river> probably tis because despite workign with jquery for almsot 2 weeks now i still dont seem to understand what widget.options is
[20:55:50] <fayimora> hi there
[20:57:19] <solidus-river> fayimora: hello
[20:57:26] <solidus-river> yep, i'm bashing my head into a brick wall
[20:57:31] <solidus-river> a brick @#$%ing wall
[20:57:37] <fayimora> lol
[20:57:39] <fayimora> same here
[20:57:45] <fayimora> jquery aint easy
[20:57:47] <fayimora> query aint easybut fun
[20:58:12] <solidus-river> sigh, i dont understand how a value can be difined in one function and then not defined in another when i'm referencing it from this
[20:58:14] <solidus-river> i dont undefine it
[20:58:19] <solidus-river> it doesn't magically dissapear
[20:58:32] <solidus-river> i can call the other function as many times as i want and its there, but the function i just added to the class
[20:58:33] <solidus-river> NOPE
[20:58:34] <solidus-river> not there
[20:58:35] <Cydd> amazing:  http://i.imgur.com/WNf65.jpg
[20:58:36] <fayimora> haha
[20:59:56] <systemfault> jQuery is easy... like playing with a toy.
[20:59:56] <solidus-river> unless for some reason one function in my class 'this' is different than the last functions 'this'
[21:00:06] <solidus-river> systemfault: then where are my options going?!?!?
[21:00:17] <systemfault> No clue, I missed the beginning
[21:01:04] <solidus-river> systemfault: i have a ui.widget i'm working with.. in an earlier function i call this.options.persona.name... it succeeds.. later I call a funciton thats in the same widget.. i call this.options.persona.. i get persona does not exist
[21:01:24] <solidus-river> if i call the previouse function, this.options.persona does exist again, as well as this.options.persona.name
[21:01:35] <solidus-river> its like for some reason for one function in my widget.. the this pointer is wrong
[21:01:41] <systemfault> How is jQueryUI jQuery? :/
[21:02:02] <solidus-river> its based on jQuery
[21:02:09] <coldhead> it relies on it
[21:02:22] <systemfault> Ahh ok... I guess
[21:02:45] <solidus-river> anyway, its been 4 hours now and i have yet to get a form to translate into an ajax request
[21:02:47] <solidus-river> ...
[21:02:50] <solidus-river> ridiculouse
[21:03:06] <solidus-river> i either really really suck at understanding options or something really messed up is going down
[21:03:12] <Cork> solidus-river: do you have a pb of this?
[21:03:36] <solidus-river> i have it hosted, but its kind of convoluded the way its hosted, i'll pastebin
[21:04:07] <Cork> what i suspect it might be deep extending the option object that causes your problem
[21:04:16] <fayimora> any rails developer here using jquery?
[21:04:27] <Cork> ?ask @ fayimora
[21:04:27] <bot-t> fayimora, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:05:23] <coldhead> convoluted*
[21:05:26] <solidus-river> http://pastebin.com/utGBE804 -> in onLogin, which is called before updatePersona this.options.persona.name is defined.. when i do this.options.persona in updatePersona it is undefined
[21:05:46] <fayimora> :D
[21:05:57] <fayimora> am goon sleep..dry
[21:06:14] <coldhead> this has to do a lot of different things, it's best to save a copy of it when you know its what you want and use that thereafter
[21:06:20] <coldhead> 'this'*
[21:06:35] <ndss56> jQuery('a#rpForm').display_resetpass_form( jQuery(this).attr('class').val() );
[21:06:59] <ndss56> has error somewhere in there
[21:07:10] <Cork> solidus-river: do you ever define the defaults for option?
[21:07:13] <Cork> +s
[21:07:18] <solidus-river> coldhead: i do that most functions
[21:07:43] <solidus-river> Cork: no i don't, how am i supposed to? I've been using options other places without anything special in my widget def's pretty ok
[21:08:03] <TeddyMurray> anyone know why jquery fancybox doesn't work in IE9?
[21:08:34] <Cork> solidus-river: well its a good place to know you have defaults added
[21:08:48] <Cork> but if you don't have it, i don't need to look for it ;)
[21:10:01] <solidus-river> Cork: yeah thats pretty much the whole class there, however something just occured to me, the way i'm calling updatePersona is different than the way I'm calling onLogin
[21:10:06] <Cork> solidus-river: for example this.options.persona_bar_isOpen = false; should REALLY be a default instaed
[21:10:21] <Cork> *instead
[21:10:36] <solidus-river> Cork: by just making an options: { persona_bar_isOpen = false },
[21:11:52] <solidus-river> in onLogin i'm calling it via this.onLogin(), however for updatePersona i'm calling it via $(document).bind('trigger_name', this, this.updatePersona)
[21:11:55] <solidus-river> maybe thats the issue
[21:12:00] <Cork> solidus-river: http://pastebin.com/4WmUQvrM
[21:12:11] <Cork> that should be after your declaration
[21:14:14] <solidus-river> Cork: cool, will do.. but i think i found where i was misunderstanding the framework
[21:14:52] <solidus-river> Cork: for some reasion this inside that function is different from a call to .bind(trigger, this, this.function) than it is on a .bind(trigger, function(){ this.function();});
[21:14:55] <solidus-river> why is that
[21:15:20] <Cork> yes
[21:15:28] <Cork> you lose the object referece
[21:15:39] <Cork> all you send is a pointer to the function
[21:16:11] <solidus-river> Cork, so i should be testing an input to my function and be declairing that input as the this pointer, and i'm guessing that input is the 2nd statement to bind
[21:16:38] <Cork> solidus-river: myobj.function_name; var some = myobj.function_name; some.call(give_this_object_here, arg, arg);
[21:17:17] <Cork> solidus-river: just add a anonymus wrapper if you want to keep the reference to the object
[21:17:27] <Cork> solidus-river: its actually not jquery specific, its how js works
[21:17:30] <systemfault> Functions lose their context with indirect calls
[21:17:40] <systemfault> jQuery.proxy can often help
[21:18:02] <Cork> and all it does is create an anonymus function :)
[21:18:16] <systemfault> Yes, with a bound context.
[21:19:24] <systemfault> ?eval jQuery.proxy(console.log, console)("Hello!");
[21:19:25] <bot-t> systemfault: "Hello!"
[21:23:19] <solidus-river> systemfault: interesting.. proxy is invaluable
[21:23:29] <solidus-river> so whats the performance hit on all this i wonder
[21:23:49] <systemfault> the performance hit of a "apply" call
[21:24:20] <Cork> solidus-river: the pref it lies in creating scopes
[21:24:25] <Cork> but its farly small
[21:24:38] <Cork> *pref hit
[21:27:21] <solidus-river> so jquery essentially emulates object oriented languages in a non object oriented language so i should be wary of the context if i ever run into an odd bug in something i wrote
[21:28:02] <Cork> solidus-river: it doesn't really have anything to do with jqiery
[21:28:08] <Cork> *jquery
[21:28:09] <ndss56> how to get class value from <a id="bar" class="foo">
[21:28:37] <Cork> solidus-river: javascript has a different take on oo, then ex. java or c++
[21:31:16] <paq> hi
[21:32:56] <coldhead> sup
[21:33:09] <charged_bolt> what is up
[21:33:44] <paq> nothin much.  You know, you can't really do access control cause javascript is client side, so any hacker can just search through and find the password

[21:45:16] <tdignan> anyone know how to use google maps for local testing? i tried generating a key with localhost, but I'm not sure it worked.
[21:45:35] <tdignan> I'm developing inside an apache virtualhost which I'm tricking by using my hosts file to alias the ServerName to 127.0.0.1
[21:45:38] <tdignan> locally
[21:45:55] <coldhead> ?csb
[21:45:55] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[21:46:16] <tdignan> heh
[21:46:22] <coldhead> i think they have a localhost key you can use
[21:47:50] <tdignan> i think you are right.. i jumped the gun and just typed 'localhost' into the api key form.
[21:47:50] <coldhead> that's what i did last time i needed one like 6 months ago
[21:50:09] <tdignan> the key check is skipped
[21:50:18] <tdignan> it's my vhost that is messing it up :/
[21:51:17] <lazarus477> Paging Mr Routh, Mr Routh please.
[21:51:21] <coldhead> DNS is hard

[21:53:04] <tdignan> devil's name system, i'll yell yer
[21:53:22] <Nitrxgen> must be talking about dns
[21:57:57] <tdignan> ok, so for future ref when using a google map: do not put typos in your script tag, and don't use a key if it's localhost.. param must not be present.
[22:00:42] <tdignan> and your key does work fine with a phoney virtualhost.. just got that working :)

[22:13:15] <paq> http://jsfiddle.net/WpCqn/4/
[22:13:31] <Nitrxgen> I meant
[22:13:41] <Nitrxgen> if($(this).val()=='pass') ...
[22:14:37] <Nitrxgen> or move the declared variable textBox inside the keyup callback function
[22:15:31] <paq> http://jsfiddle.net/WpCqn/5/

[22:15:41] <paq> Nitrxgen, thanks
[22:16:35] <paq> so for this program to be secure, I have to rewrite in server code eh, there is no way to secure it in javascript, unless I minify which might help a bit, cause then the code will be buried
[22:17:04] <Nitrxgen> make it loads the links via ajax or something
[22:17:29] <Nitrxgen> make the server code require a ?pass= param to make sure
[22:17:55] <Nitrxgen> but then.. the keyup event would kinda be pointless
[22:18:14] <Nitrxgen> 06:20am, gonna sleep, g'night
[22:18:18] <paq> hmm, yeah, thing is, my client has aspx server and I don't wanna learn that, is it easy?  I only know a little php.  I am gonna try to run this past him.  How much can I charge?  I am thinking $49

[23:11:23] <charged_bolt> did you try #mootools ?
[23:11:25] <lenswipe> zh
[23:11:35] <lenswipe> charged_bolt, i dont use mootools, it was someone from here
[23:11:47] <charged_bolt> should be paul_irish
[23:11:51] <lenswipe> they helped me design a MySQl database to be exact
[23:11:59] <lenswipe> and i could really use their help with something
[23:12:01] <charged_bolt> grep your logs
[23:12:02] <coldhead> and now it's payback time?
[23:12:13] <lenswipe> charged_bolt, yeah i did, nothing
[23:12:36] * lenswipe hands coldhead some happy pills "cheer the hell up"
[23:13:10] <fraserkillip> lenswipe: why don't you read the name list on the right and try spot their name :)
[23:13:24] <fraserkillip> if they aren't there it means they are offline

[23:14:47] <lenswipe> not sure ill give it a bash
[23:15:55] <lenswipe> ive a feeling it might have been Davey
[23:15:59] <lenswipe> but i couldnt swear to that
[23:16:14] <fraserkillip> swearing is bad for anyways
[23:16:20] <lenswipe> <fraserkillip> fuck my spelling
[23:16:35] <fraserkillip> ^ lol yeah true that....
[23:16:38] <lenswipe> x]
[23:16:49] <lenswipe> ive discovered a bug in my web app thats all
[23:16:52] <fraserkillip> im going to hell either way
[23:17:07] <fraserkillip> ^i would help, but i can't
[23:17:07] <lenswipe> ....its launch is Tuesday(today at 6pm)
[23:17:17] <lenswipe> or rather
[23:17:21] <lenswipe> thats when im presenting it
[23:17:31] <fraserkillip> ooooooh its 6:17pm for me :O
[23:17:36] <lenswipe> its not a massive bug, but it makes me look a bit of a tard
[23:17:44] <fraserkillip> whats the bug?
[23:17:54] <lenswipe> i have a pages and a users table
[23:17:59] <lenswipe> there are 2 user levels, admin and editor
[23:18:07] <lenswipe> editors can only edit pages granted to them by an admin
[23:18:45] <lenswipe> everytime an admin edits the page it checks to see if any userIDs were posted to see if it needs to add anyone to the pivot table
[23:18:57] <lenswipe> trouble is, it adds records to the pivot table regardless
[23:19:14] <lenswipe> the result being that if i ask for a list of a user's tables from the DB i get about 3 copies of the same record
[23:19:17] <lenswipe> kinda annoying
[23:20:33] <fraserkillip> thats annoying. so your saying it checks to see who should be able to edit then adds every1 into the db regardless or whether they are in it?
[23:21:14] <lenswipe> no
[23:21:23] <lenswipe> you go to edit a page right?
[23:21:28] <fraserkillip> yes
[23:21:41] <lenswipe> as well as editing the page content and title, admins also see checkboxes at the bottom of the page, one for each user
[23:22:00] <lenswipe> my code looks at the checkboxes to see which ones to add to the database
[23:22:09] <lenswipe> it then adds the ones that were posted
[23:22:41] <lenswipe> ....problem is....it does this every time the page is edited - the result being that an editor sees the same page in their list of pages to edit about 6 times or however many times the admin edits that page
[23:22:53] <fraserkillip> oh okay i think i get you
[23:22:59] <lenswipe> in other words, a pivot table entry is generated every fucking time someone edits the page
[23:23:00] <lenswipe> >:{
[23:23:05] <lenswipe> very annoying
[23:23:07] <lenswipe> not serious
[23:23:09] <lenswipe> just annoying
[23:23:38] <fraserkillip> yeah i know what you mean. i hate ACL systems and whatnot
[23:24:46] <lenswipe> hmm
[23:25:04] <lenswipe> so instead of seeing "About Us" and just "About Us"
[23:25:20] <lenswipe> the user might see: "About Us About Us About Us About Us About Us About Us About Us About Us" or whatever
[23:25:21] <lenswipe> >:/
[23:25:57] <runvnc> About Us
[23:26:05] <runvnc> About Us
[23:26:07] <coldhead> that would leave them with very little doubt as to what the page is about
[23:26:08] * lenswipe takes runvnc's batteries out
[23:26:19] <lenswipe> coldhead, indeed
[23:26:47] <fraserkillip> yes, well atleast they will know what they are viewing none-the-less
[23:26:54] <lenswipe> yes they will
[23:26:59] <lenswipe> but be honest
[23:27:02] <lenswipe> it is confusing
[23:27:09] <lenswipe> and annoying cos so far the rest of my app is perfect
[23:30:17] <fraserkillip> 'perfect' ?
[23:30:45] <lenswipe> it looks great, the code works well and ive never had any.....oh fuck
[23:30:50] <lenswipe> photoshop has just died on me

[23:36:59] <charged_bolt> its 2011
[23:37:22] <lenswipe> so go and design a better one, the client likes it, i like it, i fail to see where your opinion fits in

[23:43:36] <sedawk> anyone know how to get the immediate children of a node in a jstree?
[23:43:53] <charged_bolt> nth-child(0) ?
[23:44:03] <charged_bolt> or (1) or w/e
[23:44:23] <This> charged_bolt: how to fire it?
[23:44:39] <charged_bolt> $('#selector').keypress(function(){});
[23:47:53] <This> charged_bolt: aint working

[23:49:47] <fraserkillip> lenswipe: you thar?
[23:50:14] <coldhead> most of #jQUery today is people asking if other people "are there"
[23:50:32] <charged_bolt> but he just asked "you thar"
[23:50:45] <shellox> good morning
[23:51:02] <charged_bolt> morning sir
[23:51:56] <fraserkillip> coldhead: he is not responding to my PM so i had to ask in here :)
[23:52:35] <charged_bolt> what are you asking her ?
[23:53:27] <fraserkillip> some stuff
[23:56:34] <eml> "Lester Tester" !== "Lester Tester" <- seems like a bad way to compare strings. Is it?
[23:57:26] <shellox> can you help me with this http://dpaste.com/578151/
[23:57:56] <misterm> eml: well I dunno why you'd compare string literals like that :-p
[23:58:07] <shellox> i want to create a div with a button delete in it and some text, which can delete the div
[23:58:13] <eml> In this case I need to know if two strings match, misterm
[23:59:13] <misterm> eml: I was just joking about the fact that if they're string literals you can just look at them
