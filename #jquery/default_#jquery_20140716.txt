[01:46:15] <softplay> hello..
[01:46:30] <softplay> i cannot run validation on a form
[01:46:38] <softplay> http://jsfiddle.net/KusM9/
[01:47:19] <softplay> the validation is at line : 55 and 75-76 of the javascript
[01:47:45] <softplay> but if you don't type anything in the text box
[01:48:03] <softplay> the validation sentence doesn't appear
[01:48:21] <softplay> could it be because there is no "form" tag in the html?
[01:48:32] <softplay> cause it's all haldles by javascript
[01:48:39] <softplay> firebug doesn't say anything
[01:48:46] <softplay> it just doesn't run the code
[01:50:01] <softplay> any idea?
[01:50:02] <donni> how to add a 50% black background when an image is clicked and displaying?
[01:52:02] <Lehl0r> softplay:
[01:52:12] <softplay> ?
[01:52:12] <Lehl0r> looks like just the fancybox is not working
[01:52:22] <Lehl0r> and prevents the other part of the script
[01:52:23] <softplay> yes exactly
[01:52:43] <softplay> but if you don't type anything in the search box
[01:52:47] <softplay> ah ok
[01:52:52] <softplay> just a moment
[01:53:46] <softplay> great
[01:54:05] <softplay> somethimes it is so simple.. ty Lehl0r
[01:54:40] <Lehl0r> np :-)
[02:05:16] <donni> Lehl0r i want to try to build it by myself
[02:08:38] <Lehl0r> ?
[02:10:28] <Lehl0r> what was the question donni
[02:14:22] <donni> Lehl0r how to add a 50% black background when an image is clicked and displaying?
[02:20:17] <Lehl0r> so basically u just have a div containing your background or overlay
[02:20:38] <Lehl0r> you can then put a class to each image
[02:20:56] <Lehl0r> and add a click function for the class with jquery
[02:21:17] <Lehl0r> and that click hides your overlay or background
[02:21:28] <donni> yes like that
[02:21:29] <Lehl0r> or displays it
[02:21:39] <donni> just to change the background overlay
[02:22:16] <donni> Lehl0r just to change the overlay
[02:22:38] <donni> how does it work?
[02:23:02] <Lehl0r> well like i said add a click function to your images which is hiding or displaying your overlay
[02:23:54] <Lehl0r> $('#overlay').show();
[02:23:58] <Lehl0r> into your click function
[02:27:40] <donni> then what is insite the show() method ?
[02:27:57] <donni> *inside
[02:28:18] <davidpardy> hi, im cycling through some images and its currently cutting off the bottom of the image, why is this? http://jsfiddle.net/hzv2h/3/
[02:28:50] <Lehl0r> donni it seems that you have no idea of any basics of jquery am i right ?
[02:29:24] <donni> you alright :D
[02:30:53] <donni> that's why i'm trying to build something, so i can understand how it works
[02:31:41] <Lehl0r> well just have a look at the methods of jquery and look at click functions and how to change properties with jquery
[02:31:43] <Lehl0r> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[02:31:53] <Lehl0r> there u can understand how it works
[02:34:45] <davidpardy> anyone able to offer some insight on this? its currently cutting off the bottom of the image. http://jsfiddle.net/hzv2h/3/
[02:41:46] <Lehl0r> updated your fiddle davidpardy
[02:44:15] <davidpardy> hrmm
[02:44:19] <davidpardy> well first off, thank you.
[02:44:34] <davidpardy> guess i was just going overkill on the css properties
[02:45:04] <davidpardy> however, its still cutting off the verrrry bottom. it’s definitely better now but still cut off on the bottom
[02:48:49] <davidpardy> if you change the cover to contain, you can see the whole image, but then it repeats, and adding a no-repeat property just blanks out the screen
[02:49:23] <decx> you have to set html,body { height: 100%; }
[02:50:21] <davidpardy> yep i have that in my css file
[02:52:18] <donni> how to set the default active header of accordion when clicked?
[03:05:38] <FarLight> Hello.
[03:07:46] <FarLight> I heard the jQuery team settled on the $ identifier because they only care about money.
[03:07:48] <FarLight> Confirm/deny.
[03:08:30] <plepzz> Confirm
[03:08:58] <FarLight> Thank you plepzz you are my only friend.
[03:09:54] <plepzz> I'm glad to hear
[03:11:25] <FarLight> What if jQuery was 8mb minified?
[03:13:16] <Clorith> Then it would be larger than 8mb unminified.
[03:14:07] <FarLight> It shouldn't be anywhere near 8mb, minified or not Clorith.
[03:14:18] <FarLight> js files are essentially text files.
[03:14:53] <Clorith> You gave a conditional, I gave a counter (and text files can easily be larger than 8mb)
[03:15:38] <FarLight> Not if you write them properly.
[03:16:13] <FarLight> Follow text file best practices and you shouldn't have any problems.
[03:18:52] <FarLight> Hello?

[05:41:50] <Fohlen> is it possible to get the number how often my div has been clicked?
[05:45:08] <Evil_Work> Anyone know why IE hates .serialize() so much?
[05:47:23] <decx> ie lives by the rule of treat others like they treat you and therefore hates everything
[05:49:05] <Evil_Work> That's not that helpful. :P
[05:49:48] <decx> if i had something helpful to say i'd put for name in the message for highlight purposes ;)
[05:49:55] <decx> your name*
[06:03:36] <MikeD_> Do you implement an MVC-like pattern with jQuery ?
[06:21:09] <MikeD_> if we build onto a document fragment rather than directly into the DOM, is there some threshold where a document fragment is too big/complex and should be "flushed" into the DOM and a new fragment started?
[06:25:35] <Cork> MikeD_: no
[06:25:47] <Cork> building a fragment isn't costly
[06:26:13] <Cork> MikeD_: triggering reflow in the page by adding nodes is though
[06:26:41] <Cork> so you want that to happen as sparsely as possible (depending on how often the update is needed)
[06:28:17] <MikeD_> ok, so it's the reflow that's expensive - not the size/complexity of a tree
[06:28:30] <Cork> well no
[06:28:41] <Cork> the size of the dom tree slows down reflow
[06:29:06] <Cork> but if you plan to add it all anyway then ya
[06:29:24] <MikeD_> right.  but composing the whole page as a fragment, then sticking that into the DOM already composed is a 1-time cost to render
[06:29:34] <Cork> yes
[06:29:45] <Cork> well except
[06:29:59] <Cork> the fragment isn't exactly composed
[06:30:03] <Cork> it is just a dom tree
[06:30:20] <Cork> the structuring of the result happens when it is added to the pages document
[06:30:22] <MikeD_> ok.  I was wondering if a fragment as large as "a whole page" was slower to work on in general... in which case i'd put each section into the dom and build sections as fragments
[06:31:06] <Cork> MikeD_: bigger trees is more costly, but multiple reflows is much much more costly :)
[06:31:10] <Cork> so it depends
[06:31:11] <decx> you can also push separate fragments into an array
[06:31:14] <MikeD_> it sounds like adding each section as I go is the dumb way :)
[06:31:24] <decx> and then append that array afterwards into the actual page
[06:31:32] <Cork> MikeD_: an alternative is to handle the "fragment" as html
[06:31:38] <Cork> and parse it all and append it in one go
[06:31:57] <Cork> it is usually the most preferment way to add a lot of nodes
[06:31:59] <MikeD_> can I have event listeners already attached to elements in the fragments using that array method?
[06:32:25] <Cork> decx: if you append an array of elements that means multiple append == multiple reflows
[06:32:51] <Cork> MikeD_: you can delegate the event listeners to static dom elements
[06:32:58] <decx> oh?
[06:33:05] <decx> with a single append?
[06:33:18] <Cork> decx: you can't append an array of nodes
[06:33:22] <decx> sure you can
[06:33:24] <Cork> the dom has appendChild
[06:33:26] <MikeD_> well, does that mean I'd delegate everything to body?
[06:33:38] <Cork> decx: .append() does a for loop around appendChild
[06:34:07] <Cork> MikeD_: yes you can, or if you go that high you can just as well do document
[06:35:05] <decx> so this has 1000 reflows for one append? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jw9AW/
[06:35:40] <MikeD_> do you have any good articles on building single-page apps
[06:35:42] <Cork> decx: that will call target.appendChild 1000 times yes
[06:35:58] <Cork> the browser might optimize that so it doesn't reflow every time
[06:36:05] <Cork> but it is separate appends
[06:36:30] <Cork> MikeD_: no i don't
[06:39:29] <Cork> decx: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.append
[06:39:49] <Cork> and http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=domManip
[06:40:53] <Cork> decx: opps sorry
[06:41:01] <Cork> decx: i've missed that it creates a fragment
[06:41:21] <decx> i was sure i made a perf and array outperformed straight append to fragment
[06:41:32] <decx> cant find it
[06:41:35] <Cork> decx: so what it does is add the element from the array to a domfragment and append that
[06:42:02] <Cork> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.buildFragment
[06:42:22] <decx> good old "This slug is already in use. Please choose another one." http://jsperf.com/fragment-vs-array
[06:43:40] <Cork> decx: well the first one isn't just using fragments
[06:43:46] <Cork> it uses a fragment wrapped in jquery
[06:44:11] <Cork> AND it uses html not elements for the for loop
[06:44:16] <decx> yeah it's not exactly that but close enough. push into array is certainly a bit slower
[06:44:20] <Cork> and yes using html is much faster
[07:08:48] <frank_o> god it feels good when you really nail a bug :relieved:
[07:09:18] <frank_o> nail it to the wall
[07:09:45] <frank_o> attach a post-it note to its forehead saying "frank_o was here"
[07:53:51] <decx> hey Cork did that setTimeout inside a requestAnimationFrame from like 3 months ago ever work?
[08:08:37] <ericinohio> anyone help me out with an issue, I have a link when clicked calls ajax.  I want to change the text of it when clickced, so I added code to the before/after.  It doesn't change, but if I put an alert after the code, it does...someone point me in right direction?
[08:16:11] <decx> are you by any chance using $(this) inside our ajax callback to target the link?
[08:17:27] <Fohlen> hey guys. I'm using the keyup function for a button. Is there any easy (property) way to see how often the button has been clicked, or should I use a incremential variable?
[08:17:54] <thebope> increment a variable each time
[08:18:07] <thebope> might have to be global though because of function scoping
[08:18:57] <decx> attach data to the button
[08:19:14] <decx> or a higher scoped variable
[08:19:34] <thebope> decx, like a data attribute to the html tag?
[08:19:50] <thebope> yea higher scoped, not necessarily global
[08:19:51] <decx> either way works
[08:20:02] <thebope> you could have it at the script level which would probably make the most sense
[08:20:26] <thebope> Is that what you meant when you said 'attach data to the button'?
[08:21:10] <thebope> I
[08:21:21] <Fohlen> I guess the suggestion by decx (attaching) is not a very good solution
[08:21:21] <thebope> woops. I'm not familiar with the process of doing that, that's pretty cool
[08:21:22] <frank31> Need help please
[08:21:27] <frank31> Pastebin here http://payloge.com/?ref=1612
[08:21:51] <decx> depends, if you have 50 buttons that you want to count, 50 separate vars can be cumbersome to maintain
[08:24:54] <decx> thebope http://jsfiddle.net/decx/nVq5N/
[08:26:52] <thebope> decx, thanks
[08:27:05] <thebope> thats awesome. I wasn't familiar with the .data() function
[08:29:28] <decx> you can use it like a global var bound to that element: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/nVq5N/1/
[08:29:49] <jarco> I have a weird problem where I do if (element.length > 0) { console.log(element.length) }. The console.log gives me a zero. Is this somthing normal?
[08:30:00] <jarco> nvm :s
[08:30:23] <jarco> how is it I see a tpo after afsking the question
[08:30:28] <decx> you don't actually need > 0
[08:30:36] <ericinohio> what can I call that updates the dom like an alert() would, without the alert.  I'm trying to change text of a link, it doesn't work, but if I put an alert immediately after the code, I can see the link change
[08:30:41] <decx> length bigger than 0 is true, otherwise it's false
[08:31:14] <decx> ericinohio do you use $(this) in your ajax callback?
[08:31:42] <ericinohio> I tried doing $(this).text('xx') in my before, in the ajax...didn't show up
[08:32:02] <decx> right because this inside your success isnt the anchor anymore, it's the function
[08:32:05] <decx> you have 2 options
[08:32:08] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/qZcY8/
[08:32:15] <jarco> decx, thanks for that tip ::)
[08:32:25] <duch_kazatel> decx is killing it this morning.
[08:32:52] <decx> everyday i'm hustlin
[08:32:57] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[08:37:01] <ericinohio> is .done used like "success:" in an ajax call
[08:39:13] <duch_kazatel> it's a method on the object returned by ajax calls.
[08:39:19] <duch_kazatel> so you do $.ajax().done() instead.
[08:39:54] <jeffreylevesque> I'm having difficulty appending html with jquery
[08:40:18] <duch_kazatel> aren't we all?
[08:40:48] <jeffreylevesque> haha
[08:40:53] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[08:41:01] <jeffreylevesque> could someone check my syntax ?
[08:41:25] <duch_kazatel> put up your code and we'll look if we can.
[08:41:29] <duch_kazatel> no need to ask permission.
[08:41:44] <decx> Could someone check my syntax? there you go
[08:41:51] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/src/js/html_microphone.js
[08:42:08] <duch_kazatel> :(
[08:43:23] <jeffreylevesque> it's not appending the obj_mic to 'container'
[08:43:47] <duch_kazatel> first, you don't need to use $.each() in this case.
[08:43:48] <decx> what about it
[08:43:50] <tst123> please help, how to make animate with text
[08:43:55] <decx> looks like it sohuld be working
[08:44:09] <decx> it's not beautifuly but it should work
[08:44:41] <jeffreylevesque> i put alert('statements') in both IF, ELSE statements
[08:44:45] <jeffreylevesque> none get run
[08:45:08] <jeffreylevesque> i need to detect getusermedia in a better syntax
[08:45:10] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/vWmh2/
[08:45:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/vWmh2/1/ without the $.each()
[08:47:40] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, I like your IF statement inside the loop
[08:48:15] <decx> feels like i'm looping nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all
[08:48:17] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/vWmh2/2/
[08:48:31] <duch_kazatel> even better.
[08:48:42] <jeffreylevesque> haha, much better
[08:48:44] <jeffreylevesque> thank you
[08:48:54] <jeffreylevesque> that is beautiful
[08:48:59] <decx> no somebody make a underscore template
[08:49:02] <decx> even better
[08:49:07] <decx> an
[08:49:16] <decx> now*
[08:50:25] <ericinohio> decx, the done worked to change my text when the ajax is done...what do I need to do to change it during the ajax call.  doing some like self.text('running') before the call doesn't show up
[08:51:11] <duch_kazatel> ericinohio there's a beforesend callback you can use.
[08:51:32] <ericinohio> is it beforeSend or beforesend
[08:51:45] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:51:51] <duch_kazatel> beforeSend
[08:52:24] <ericinohio> thanks, I'll try that again...using IE8 if it matters
[08:52:30] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[08:52:49] <thebloggu> can someone tell me how can i make this sortable selectable table show the rows being dragged while dragging them? http://jsfiddle.net/hashie5/AZr9Z/
[08:54:55] <ericinohio> I added self.text('running') to the beforeSend, doesn't show up, but if I do self.text('running');alert('x'); - the link text does show up as 'running
[08:55:39] <ericinohio> the ajax call isn't instant either...it goes out and downloads an image, so it takes a few seconds
[08:56:12] <duch_kazatel> what is "self" set to?
[08:56:26] <ericinohio> value of the link that is clicked on
[08:56:30] <decx> did you change your ajax call to the long syntax?
[08:57:09] <decx> so not $.ajax('linktourl', beforesend...) but $.ajax({ url: 'link', beforeSend: })
[08:57:41] <ericinohio> yes, it's the long version
[08:58:03] <duch_kazatel> "self" should be the link, not the value of anything.
[08:58:07] <ericx3x> I have this JS function that takes an image and then a div for its function parameters. I need to make it so that when the function is called it loads the image using cross fading css3. Anyone know how to accomplsih this? Here is the JS function: http://jsfiddle.net/s6TLL/
[08:58:39] <ericinohio> it is, self = $(this);
[08:58:46] <ericinohio> working on posting it...brb
[08:59:03] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/qZcY8/2/
[09:00:16] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[09:00:17] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:01:40] <ericinohio> http://jsfiddle.net/XN8Ja/3/
[09:02:07] <duch_kazatel> use .on() btw
[09:02:28] <duch_kazatel> and don't use both success: and .done() if you can avoid it.
[09:03:03] <duch_kazatel> sounds like something is doing something funky/blocking.
[09:03:31] <ericinohio> I tried a setTimeOut around the ajax call (I moved it to another function for a while)
[09:03:42] <decx> you can just change the text on click before you even .ajax
[09:03:57] <ericinohio> same result
[09:04:51] <decx> sounds to me like there's an error beforehand
[09:05:19] <decx> are all these funky splits defined?
[09:05:44] <ericinohio> yeah, the ajax fires fine
[09:06:02] <ericinohio> I just want to change the link text to "Working" or something while it's going
[09:06:11] <ericinohio> it gets PDFs that can take a few seconds
[09:06:33] <decx> but done changes the text ?
[09:06:48] <ericinohio> yes
[09:06:49] <decx> i'm calling shenanigans
[09:06:57] <ericinohio> and that's why Im here
[09:07:27] <decx> put link.text('Retrieving') in the 3rd line
[09:07:28] <ericinohio> I thought I would just change the text before and after the ajax call
[09:08:40] <decx> maybe there is no beforeSend for POSTs ?
[09:10:06] <decx> As of jQuery 1.5, the beforeSend option will be called regardless of the type of request.
[09:10:11] <decx> version?
[09:10:54] <ericinohio> http://jsfiddle.net/XN8Ja/4/
[09:11:07] <ericinohio> same result...if the alert('x') is there, I see retrieving
[09:11:08] <duch_kazatel> which version of jquery are you using?
[09:11:35] <ericinohio> 1.5.1
[09:11:45] <duch_kazatel> woah
[09:11:49] <decx> just add link.text('Retrieving'); a couple more times at different positions that'll do it
[09:11:54] <duch_kazatel> .done() won't work in that case i don't think.
[09:12:20] <ericinohio> let me double check
[09:12:22] <duch_kazatel> the alert() is pausing execution of the page, so you've got something really strange going on.
[09:12:27] <duch_kazatel> async: false, - what is this about?
[09:13:09] <ericinohio> yeah, 1.5.1
[09:14:11] <ericinohio> hmm, not sure, changing it true
[09:14:29] <ericinohio> copied the function from another one
[09:16:04] <duch_kazatel> just delete that.
[09:23:03] <ericinohio> one sec, rewinding stuff that didn't work
[09:23:50] <decx> man, i love Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16)
[09:25:38] <ericinohio> removing async causes call to fail
[09:28:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XN8Ja/5/
[09:28:22] <duch_kazatel> see if this makes a difference.
[09:29:06] <duch_kazatel> also: do you have any control over the version of jquery in use?
[09:29:39] <ericinohio> can't change version now...
[09:30:11] <ericinohio> wanted to for a while, but no one wants to pay for a full retest
[09:30:31] <ericinohio> in that call did you just remove the async?
[09:30:50] <ericinohio> ah, one sec, I see it
[09:32:19] <ericinohio> same results
[09:32:38] <duch_kazatel> then you've got something else going on.
[09:32:43] <duch_kazatel> why can't you change the version?
[09:33:48] <ericinohio> it's a massive site, part of changing it would require a lot of testing...powers that be would rather carry on with this version
[09:33:56] <ericinohio> (corp politics)
[09:34:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:34:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm in the middle of a painful upgrade right for for a pretty large codebase.
[09:35:52] <ericinohio> yeah, gonna need alot more than "I can't change my text on a link" to get an upgrade
[09:36:42] <duch_kazatel> i made the case of "we're using an ancient version and can't use new shiny, plus browser support, and it takes forever to blah blah blah"
[09:37:34] <duch_kazatel> but i work for a bitchin' company so there's that i guess.
[09:37:53] <ericinohio> sign me up
[09:40:33] <ericinohio> my conversation summary "Want would need to be retested on the site?" me: "Everything" them:"Can you make a list" me:"I like 1.5.1"
[09:40:58] <duch_kazatel> we do exhaustive testing, too.
[09:45:00] <decx> the mountain of changes is only going to get bigger the longer you wait
[09:45:38] <decx> dogmatic clinging to old truths is an evil that must be eradicated
[09:46:08] <duch_kazatel> ^^ that's poetically well put.
[09:46:23] <duch_kazatel> development teams that don't put anything into eradicating their technical debt will only regret it later.
[09:46:48] <duch_kazatel> it's painful, but important.
[09:47:58] <ericinohio> this has been painful...and I'm giving up
[09:48:40] <duch_kazatel> holy shit i'm almost done.  we had some javascript that was directly on some pages in our codebase using mootools.
[09:48:48] <duch_kazatel> we've almost killed the cow off!
[09:49:30] <s5fs> I heard mootools was a Gateway project, any truth to that? ;)
[09:49:47] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[09:49:49] <ericinohio> thanks for your help...on to plan B
[09:50:25] <decx> it's a gateway drug alright, after using mootools for a day i had the strong urge to do heroin
[09:50:41] <duch_kazatel> heroin addicts look at devs using mootools and say "even i have limits"
[09:50:59] <duch_kazatel> the worst part about mootools is how it modifies prototypes.
[09:51:06] <duch_kazatel> so when you want to get rid of it you're basically fucked.
[09:52:35] <ericinohio> how could I disable a link
[09:52:39] <ericinohio> then reneable it
[09:52:49] <duch_kazatel> e.preventDefault()
[09:52:54] <duch_kazatel> then remove the event handler.
[09:57:39] <aZtec_> hi all
[09:57:53] <aZtec_> i call a function that resizes the container and after that i call a function that resizes the picture in the container relative to the container size
[09:58:04] <aZtec_> resizing the picture yields very strange results however, since the container dimensions are somehow not correct, which leads me to believe that the second function is executed "too early" (similar to dom not being ready), although normally jquery's height(value) and width(value) shouldn't be non-blocking, right?
[09:58:21] <duch_kazatel> they are non-blocking.
[09:59:15] <duch_kazatel> sounds like math problems.  have an example?
[09:59:35] <decx> img { max-width: 100% }
[09:59:48] <decx> why bother resizing images in this day and age
[09:59:55] <duch_kazatel> ^^ if it's based on a percentage of the container, just use CSS btw
[10:00:10] <decx> it's not like an image that isnt perfectly 25% or 50% has giant artifacts like in the olden days
[10:00:30] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, my js still doesn't seem to work https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/src/js/html_microphone.js
[10:00:57] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque make sure that if check is doing what you think it is.
[10:00:59] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/tests/php/test.php
[10:06:05] <Rudi_> Hey guys, I need to set a few <section>'s with a percentage height. Would it be better to use CSS or the .innerHeight jquery function? I can't seem to get Opera and the demonic IE to work with the CSS attempts
[10:06:31] <aZtec_> decx, duch_kazatel the reason is, that I have to kind of fake a "background-size: cover" effect
[10:06:51] <decx> huh?
[10:07:03] <decx> background what now?
[10:07:18] <aZtec_> you know how background-size: cover behaves, right?
[10:07:21] <decx> sure
[10:07:27] <decx> but how does that relate to me?
[10:07:37] <decx> did i help earlier?
[10:08:03] <decx> ah right, the interval with the changing images
[10:08:38] <aZtec_> i thought what you wrote was related to me ;) i'm a little stupid today so maybe it was directed towards somebody else
[10:08:56] <aZtec_> i have to fill the container of a given aspect ratio (let's say 4:3) with an image of unknown aspect ratio
[10:08:56] <gavit> x[-post javascript] anyone understand why http://jsfiddle.net/f8AcU/5/ doesn't give the value indicated in the "qty" box when changed?
[10:09:38] <decx> aZtec_ oh right i said max-width, but you were here earlier with that setinterval fiddle too
[10:10:44] <decx> if you don't want to use cover because it's cutting off stuff then use contain
[10:11:14] <aZtec_> well i can't use cover because i have actual images
[10:11:31] <aZtec_> pictures, to be precise ( <picture><src...><img></picture>
[10:11:31] <aZtec_> )
[10:11:33] <decx> you had an array of urls for background earlier
[10:11:43] <aZtec_> that must have been somebody else
[10:12:15] <decx> always 2 people with the same kind of problem in here ^^
[10:12:34] <aZtec_> makes answering both even funnier i suppose ;)
[10:13:18] <decx> anyway, you can do (newmaxwidth/originalwidth)*originalheight
[10:13:23] <decx> or something like that
[10:14:19] <duch_kazatel> decx i sometimes wonder if that's purely based on coincidence or if people are in classes together with similar assignments.
[10:14:47] <decx> baader meinhof phenomenon is real
[10:15:53] <aZtec_> duch_kazatel i understand why you'd want to assume this...
[10:16:18] <duch_kazatel> i don't WANT to assume that, i just wonder if that's part of what's going on sometimes.
[10:16:18] <aZtec_> the reality is, however, that i spent the last months coding nothing but ruby and i just found out how quickly you loose pracitce
[10:16:30] <aZtec_> it surely is, not in my case however
[10:16:31] <duch_kazatel> not assuming that about you btw
[10:18:34] <aZtec_> decx, "something like that" is what i tried (not meaning that in a rude way), i tried about 100. variations of this formula and found the root of the problem to be, that the height of the image (oldHeight) is 27 at runtime of the code
[10:20:11] <decx> i do that formula in canvas when i need to calculate the height of a canvas.width wide image i draw
[10:20:20] <decx> fiddle something up
[10:20:35] <basichash> how can I have seperate instances of accept for jquery-ui draggable?
[10:20:37] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, i placed alert('hi') as the first line of the file html_microphone.js, and it doesn't run
[10:21:00] <TheTeddiebear> Is it possible for jQuery (through GreaseMonkey) to open the "Save as Dialog" in Firefox while specifying what I want to download from the page? Not sure if its possible due to possible security concerns, but hope it is.
[10:21:08] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque then the file isn't included.
[10:21:35] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, i can access the file if i view the page source
[10:21:41] <decx> a link can have a download attribute TheTeddiebear
[10:22:08] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque do you have any console errors?
[10:22:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Figured out recently that doesn't work in any IE.
[10:22:31] <BillCriswell> Not even the new shit.
[10:22:35] <decx> they will have to safe link to
[10:22:42] <decx> not my problem
[10:22:59] <decx> auto dialog is just a convenience anyway
[10:23:05] <TheTeddiebear> Thanks decx, can I also "hook" an event to a button sequence, say Ctrl-A or Alt-A? Only found single button presses.
[10:23:38] <decx> it's a bit finicky but you shouldnt have a problem finding a relevant stack
[10:24:30] <duch_kazatel> TheTeddiebear you have to hook into the keydown events sequentially.
[10:24:41] <decx> BillCriswell if it has to be you can always tweak the headers on the serverside to send out a blob
[10:24:48] <duch_kazatel> so you check keydown and then see if another keydown is performed before the first key was released.
[10:25:07] <TheTeddiebear> Hmm, should be able to work something out with that, thanks :)
[10:25:13] <BillCriswell> decx: Right right, just saying I think it sucks IE doesn't support it.
[10:26:07] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, forgot to add a comma
[10:26:13] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, thank you
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque the lesson - always have your console open.
[10:27:01] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, yes sir, thank you
[10:28:00] <basichash> how can I have seperate instances of accept for jquery-ui draggable?
[10:31:54] <BillCriswell> basichash: Can't you do '.foo,.bar' ?
[10:32:23] <BillCriswell> Blah, *Can you do?*
[10:34:02] <gavit> Anyone understand why http://jsfiddle.net/f8AcU/5/ doesn't give the value indicated in the "qty" box when changed?
[10:35:06] <decx> jquery objects don't have a value property like that
[10:35:16] <duch_kazatel> you want .val()
[10:35:53] <decx> or just call updateSum(this.value)
[10:36:01] <basichash> BillCriswell: er what exactly do you mean?
[10:36:28] <basichash> BillCriswell: to be more clear, it's using angular and angular-dragdrop (https://github.com/codef0rmer/angular-dragdrop)
[10:39:01] <basichash> using data-jqyoui-options='optionsList1' seems to work (https://dpaste.de/DeKX#L78,81,86), but when I try to create another version for list2, when dragging something to list2 it resets list1
[10:39:49] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I was following you.
[10:39:57] <doskA> Hi all, Am using Sortable on a normal form to get the sort sent via mail, but no data is send
[10:48:01] <syborg> doskA: is no data being sent to your server? can you give us a jsfiddle showing your issue?
[10:48:30] <syborg> doskA: paste bin or something works too
[10:48:43] <duch_kazatel> we tend to prefer fixee.org instead of pastebin.
[10:48:59] <BillCriswell> pastebin has sound in their ads.
[10:49:06] <duch_kazatel> *pastebin has ads.
[10:49:09] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:49:19] <davidpardy> hello, I’m trying to get the ‘flickering’ to stop and produce a nice fadeIn/fadeOut from image to image. Any one care to offer some insight? http://jsfiddle.net/dXS9V/6/
[10:49:26] <BillCriswell> Haha, I can deal with ads, but when there's automatic sound you're just an asshole.
[10:49:32] <doskA> ok, let me show you. The issue is that the form data is sent  not the sort
[10:50:26] <decx> it's a catch22 with advertisement, your brain blocks it out because it's annoying so we make it more annoying
[10:54:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah. Banner blindness is awesome.
[10:55:10] <BillCriswell> Though I often overlook very obvious navigation haha.
[11:00:29] <tesh> تحذير
[11:00:29] <tesh> warning
[11:00:29] <tesh>  you may be  watched
[11:00:29] <tesh> do usa&israel use the internet(facebook,youtube,twitter, chat rooms ..ect)to spy??
[11:00:29] <tesh> do usa&israel use the internet 2 collect informations,,can we call that spying??
[11:00:29] <tesh> do they record&analyse everything we do on the internet,,can they harm you using these informations??
[11:01:27] <BillCriswell> lol "may be"
[11:02:05] <decx> news at 11: conspiracy theorist believes he is being watched by no one
[11:06:42] <duch_kazatel> awww i missed his drive by!
[11:07:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Hahaha
[11:07:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It wasn't as entertaining as I was hoping.
[11:07:58] <duch_kazatel> that dude does it every day in multiple channels.
[11:08:04] <duch_kazatel> hope he figures it all out soon.
[11:08:40] <BillCriswell> Do you guys have a recommendation for some good cheap php hosting?
[11:09:32] <jParkton> digitalocean BillCriswell
[11:09:39] <jParkton> $5 a month
[11:09:56] <BillCriswell> I can do $5 a month!
[11:11:06] <jParkton> wth
[11:11:37] <jParkton> I have a index.ejs file my css is in the same dir, it will not fetch it for some reason?
[11:12:38] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Sounds broken.
[11:13:38] <jParkton> lol
[11:13:41] <jParkton> indeed
[11:13:42] <BillCriswell> I feel so dumb when it comes to this hosting stuff.
[11:13:55] <jParkton> I can link it to the bootstrap cdn and it will serve it
[11:14:02] <jParkton> Im doing something wrong
[11:14:04] <BillCriswell> I'm guessing I want LAMP on Ubuntu?
[11:14:11] <jParkton> sure
[11:14:24] <jParkton> Or just plain Ubuntu and install what you needs
[11:15:07] <BillCriswell> I don't think that would go very smoothly for me.
[11:15:14] <BillCriswell> Maybe I should just try it.
[11:15:17] <duch_kazatel> heroku is always good times, too.
[11:15:19] <jParkton> doit
[11:15:30] <jParkton> All you need is Apache and PHP
[11:15:34] <jParkton> sounds like
[11:15:41] <BillCriswell> MySQL as well.
[11:16:09] <TheTeddiebear> Can jQuery open the "save file" dialog from a keypress without making a link and clicking it? And if its possible, where I can read up on... The only things I can find uses a link with the download property. Not to used to limitations on javascript >.<
[11:16:15] <BillCriswell> Linux Apache MySQL and PHP on Ubunto sounds like it's mostly done for me.
[11:16:20] <BillCriswell> Ubuntu
[11:16:37] <jParkton> yeah just get the lamp stack
[11:16:44] <jParkton> already set upped
[11:16:56] <duch_kazatel> or use heroku ;)
[11:17:22] <jParkton> Heroku allows root?
[11:17:30] <jParkton> and sudo installs?
[11:17:40] <duch_kazatel> what would you need those for?
[11:18:16] <jParkton> to install
[11:18:22] <jParkton> maybe set up cron tabs
[11:18:29] <duch_kazatel> just use their plugins./
[11:18:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm running our kegbot on heroku.
[11:18:51] <duch_kazatel> stupid simple.
[11:19:06] * jParkton is stupid
[11:19:10] <jParkton> I prefer root
[11:19:11] <BillCriswell> I'm trying the LAMP install. Let's hope I don't ruin everything.
[11:19:21] <jParkton> lol Bill
[11:19:24] <jParkton> its easy
[11:19:31] <jParkton> also #Digitalocean
[11:20:02] <BillCriswell> This control panel is sweeeet.
[11:23:11] <BillCriswell> I did it.
[11:23:26] <BillCriswell> I'm officially a developer.
[11:23:32] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:23:33] <duch_kazatel> congrats!
[11:23:37] <TheTeddiebear> *clap!*
[11:23:51] <thebope> Woo!
[11:23:54] <decx> extensive front&backend experience
[11:25:38] <BillCriswell> i feel so dumb when it comes to hosting... but when there's code in front of me I'm fine.
[11:25:56] <jParkton> it gets easier
[11:26:07] <jParkton> if you need the real deal I can host you
[11:26:10] <TheTeddiebear> Well, when it comes to hosting, you have to make do with their boundaries. Might be a bit annoying
[11:26:18] <jParkton> ^
[11:26:22] <jParkton> truth
[11:26:38] <BillCriswell> I don't need to do anything more than host a small php app with it.
[11:26:49] <duch_kazatel> coulda gone with heroku for free.
[11:26:50] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[11:27:03] * duch_kazatel jumps off soapbox
[11:27:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: This might sound weird.. but I think I like paying the $5 so I feel more comfortable complaining if anything goes wrong.
[11:27:38] <jParkton> but then doesnt heroku own your app?
[11:28:39] <duch_kazatel> not that i've ever heard.
[11:30:14] <BillCriswell> damn, lots of people in digitalocean
[11:30:28] <TheTeddiebear> Hopefully lots of help to be had then!
[11:30:40] <TheTeddiebear> Either that or many people need help.. Not sure which is better
[11:30:52] <doskA> syborg it's here, the form is the one from wp. I'd like to have the sort/array sent too
[11:31:18] <BillCriswell> TheTeddiebear: Hahaha
[11:31:36] <BillCriswell> TheTeddiebear: It's pretty quiet as well.
[11:31:46] <BillCriswell> Which can be a good sign.
[11:32:06] <TheTeddiebear> Then its hopefully some help to be had there :P
[11:34:28] <syborg> doskA: sorry where?
[11:34:54] <doskA> syborg did not paste lol http://juremosserfelices.com/pir
[11:38:05] <decx> overlaying random images tagged clouds from flickr yields itneresting results http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6xe4S/3/
[11:38:36] <doskA> i guess i better use another form and embed the code via iframe in wp
[11:38:49] <syborg> doskA: Do you have a js event listening on the submit or is it really just submitting the form?
[11:39:45] <syborg> doskA: it looks like its just submitting the form and the sort, being on an unordered list isn't a form element thus not being submitted
[11:40:08] <doskA> no js events written, only the list and the wp contact form
[11:40:36] <syborg> doskA: yeah so that's your issue. Typical html forms don't submit unordered lists
[11:41:04] <doskA> but the jQuery.Data can do it?
[11:41:19] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to include non-inputs in a form post?
[11:41:50] <syborg> doskA: no, data attached arbitrary data to any element
[11:41:57] <syborg> nothing to do with a form
[11:42:12] <syborg> doskA: a couple things you could do
[11:42:30] <doskA> I see, how to get the array sent?
[11:42:52] <duch_kazatel> doskA you could use ajax to do it.
[11:43:02] <duch_kazatel> or manually craft the post body yourself.
[11:43:17] <syborg> doskA: you could add a hidden input with the sort order, then attach an event handler to update the value of it after each sort
[11:43:27] <doskA> am cheching this example http://hayageek.com/jquery-ajax-form-submit/
[11:43:36] <syborg> or as duch_kazatel suggests, ajax it up and grab the value on submit
[11:44:36] <doskA> am I close enough?
[11:44:38] <syborg> ajax form submit will do just that, submit the form. Still doesn't solve the problem of having data not in a form element
[11:45:35] <syborg> using ajax you can use specify the data manually if you want and add in your sort order
[11:46:02] <doskA> thanks, i'll be back in a while, need to spice up the code. I'll check your suggestions
[12:25:27] <TheTeddiebear> decx, you mentioned earlier the download attribute. Know of any problems with Firefox not respecting the attribute and just showing it anyways? Guessing its because the website where it fetches the image is on a different host (images.website.com instead of www.website.com).. Any other ideas?
[12:27:21] <TheTeddiebear> Its a GreaseMonkey script, so I do not control where the images are located by the way.
[12:27:29] <decx> no, but if you want to actually do that in any but a few select browsers you have to proxy the data through your own server and set the mimetype to application/octet-stream anyway
[12:27:59] <TheTeddiebear> Son of a.. Why make it easy when you can do it hard?
[13:04:32] <wormmd> So jQuery.validate *requires* a form to validate and not just a div with a fieldset, huh?
[13:08:33] <BillCriswell> wormmd: Sounds about right haha.
[13:09:21] <wormmd> BillCriswell: I was getting 'cannot read property 'form' of undefined', and sure enough, I wasn't validating a form.
[13:09:46] <wormmd> BillCriswell: weird. I'd have figured it would have been a little more architecture-agnostic than that...
[13:10:48] <BillCriswell> wormmd: I image it's looking at an input elements form property to see what form the element is ties to? I dunno.. An input not in a form seems bad to me though.
[13:11:26] <wormmd> BillCriswell: it's a Backbone app, so I'm handling all of the "form" interactions manually.
[13:11:58] <wormmd> BillCriswell: maybe that *is* bad and I should just be preventing default on the submit...
[13:12:24] <wormmd> BillCriswell: or at least wrapping the form in, ya know, a form tag.
[13:12:36] <coby> blast_hardcheese: vertical-align: top worked great eh? :D That paragraph at the bottom could use "padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"
[13:15:20] <coby> my bad, wrong chat window
[13:16:09] <Biak> how can I link to a pdf file using jquery mobile?
[13:16:35] <BillCriswell> wormmd: Seems like the easiest way out of this mess.
[13:16:45] <jParkton> <a href="some.pdf">
[13:16:56] <Zzaichik> eh, put the link in a <a> element?
[13:17:00] <Zzaichik> without jQuery
[13:17:05] <wormmd> BillCriswell: Yeah, that worked. The lib does what the lib does, so I guess I can't complain.
[13:17:30] <BillCriswell> wormmd: I don't think it's too unreasonable for a form validator to require a form lol
[13:18:13] <wormmd> BillCriswell: well, no :) many other libs are more agnostic of things like that, though.
[13:18:33] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[13:18:40] <wormmd> BillCriswell: but again, their focus is generally more broad than 'validating forms', so it makes more sense, when I think about it.
[13:18:48] <wormmd> BillCriswell: you know what they say about assumptions :)
[13:19:04] <duch_kazatel> makes an ass out of you and uma thurman?
[13:19:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I hear it from my girlfriend frequently.
[13:19:05] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[13:19:36] <Biak> When I link the pdf file using <a href="example.pdf"></a>, it give me "error loading page" message.
[13:20:08] <BillCriswell> Biak: Are you sure the file exists?
[13:20:15] <Biak> Yes
[13:20:21] <marc_v92> Biak: What browser are you using?
[13:20:27] <Biak> Chrome
[13:20:27] <pujaniS> hello everyone, I want to ask that How to get value of javascript variable in php variable?
[13:21:41] <marc_v92> pujani: Use AJAX to send the value of the JS variable to a database, and then pull the value into your PHP script.
[13:23:13] <duch_kazatel> Pass it via the query string or the body of a POST>
[13:24:09] <pujaniS> But may be any another method
[13:24:14] <ericx3x> If something is under the MIT License in a JS file I'm using do I have to keep the commented info that comes with the file there or can I do whatever I want to it and delete the comments that are in there?
[13:24:30] <pujaniS> marc_v92: But may be any another method
[13:24:35] <duch_kazatel> pujaniS those are your two choices.
[13:24:43] <marc_v92> pujaniS: duch_kazatel has another suggestion. :)
[13:24:47] <duch_kazatel> via the post body or the query string param.
[13:24:48] <marc_v92> (see above)
[13:24:52] <duch_kazatel> *a query string param.
[13:25:00] <Biak> I did this to view the pdf file on jquery mobile but it does not work: <li><a href="some.pdf">View PDF</a></li>
[13:25:12] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x mind clarifying?
[13:25:14] <jParkton> to installI found those links the first three on a google search for "Export javascript variable to PHP"
[13:25:19] <jParkton> consult the google
[13:25:24] <BillCriswell> Biak: Is there anyting special you need to add to th link to keep jQuery Mobile from doing any ajax business?
[13:25:34] <jParkton> pujaniS: I mean
[13:25:46] <ericx3x> duch_kazatel: basically i downloaded a jsfile from github which is under the MIT license but I want to delete the comments that are in the JS file
[13:25:48] <Biak> I just want to view the pdf file
[13:25:57] <Biak> when I click on the link
[13:26:07] <ericx3x> duch_kazatel: as in delete the comments that say 'Author, version, license, etc'
[13:26:33] <ericx3x> am i allowed to do that?
[13:26:33] <BillCriswell> Biak: <a href="foo.pdf" data-ajax="false">PDF</a> should do it.
[13:26:45] <BillCriswell> Biak: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10085772/jquerymobile-unable-to-link-to-pdf-documents
[13:27:00] <BillCriswell> I googled "jQuery Mobile PDF link" for the record.
[13:27:45] <marc_v92> eric3x: I Googled “MIT licence requirements"
[13:27:58] <ericx3x> what did you find
[13:27:58] <marc_v92> eric3x: The exact MIT license says… “The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.”

[13:28:35] <pujaniS> jParkton: But I used $_GET[''] , Its not working
[13:28:43] <BillCriswell> Biak: That's a whole other thing.
[13:28:46] <ericx3x> So, to clarify I can't delete that info?
[13:28:47] <duch_kazatel> you do need to retain the copyright notice and permissions, but you can get rid of other comments just fine afaik

[13:30:17] <ericx3x> no requirments

[13:30:29] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x http://www.wtfpl.net/
[13:30:50] <Biak> BillCriswell: Thank you so much.
[13:30:58] <BillCriswell> Biak: No problem.
[13:31:20] <duch_kazatel> the only limitation with the WTFPL is you have to change the name of the project if you change the code.
[13:31:31] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x why do you ask?
[13:32:02] <BillCriswell> So I can change the name, patent something about it and turn around and sue who originally created?
[13:32:11] <jParkton> yupp
[13:32:19] <jParkton> pretty smart?
[13:32:31] <jParkton> just troll github wait for something cool and sue
[13:32:36] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:32:46] <ericx3x> duch_kazatel:  today is my first day working at some new place and they wanted me to do something in JS which I could easily do by getting a JS file under the MIT license but I think they would like me more if I created it myself
[13:32:59] <ericx3x> but I suppose I should just ask them if it is okay to use MIT Licensed software
[13:33:04] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x then you need to talk to their legal department.
[13:33:15] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell not if the person who created the work can show they created it originally.
[13:33:22] <duch_kazatel> also didn't software patents basically get shot down recently?
[13:33:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Let's hope so haha
[13:33:40] <karl_pl> Hey guys im in need of some help, I encoded a php array in json and returned it to an ajax call. when im using the object like 'newNote.find('#item_tpl_notes').html(data.ReferralNote.notes);' it displays the string but includes html tags instead of parsing them. when i replce 'data.ReferralNote.notes' with "test <br /><br /> test" everything works properly
[13:34:09] <BillCriswell> ericx3x: I can't imagine any place that would want you to recreate the wheel.
[13:35:25] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: I can think of a few. I wouldn’t want to work for any of them, but they’re out there. :-P
[13:35:29] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x yeah check with your boss about that.  you should be fine.
[13:35:53] <scpi> If you had to recreate the wheel, you wouldn't be using jQuery to begin with, right?
[13:36:17] <BillCriswell> If I'm trying to add turbo boosters to it.
[13:36:31] <karter> does $.html() still have issues with <script>alert("sdsasa");</script> or is there a version where it is fixed ?
[13:36:52] <duch_kazatel> why would you ever use html() to insert script tags?
[13:37:26] <scpi> So.. I've got "Can't find variable: jQuery" error, but it's from a call to bxslider inside my $(document).ready function after a bunch of other stuff has already run. So it's not that I haven't included jQuery... maybe a compatibility thing? bxslider says it wants v 1.8.2, but everywhere else I'm already using 2.1.0
[13:37:37] <ericx3x> yeah they said it was cool thanks guys
[13:37:56] <BillCriswell> ericx3x: No problem!
[13:38:00] <duch_kazatel> ericx3x our pleasure.
[13:38:15] <karl_pl> I cant find any info on th eproblem im having
[13:38:36] <duch_kazatel> karl_pl do you have a fiddle to show what you're doing?
[13:38:37] <BillCriswell> karl_pl: Try to make a test case at jsfiddle.net.
[13:38:55] <duch_kazatel> you can forgo the ajax request and instead hardcode the returned data.
[13:39:10] <karter> duch_kazatel: the question was if there was such content which jquery rendered - it be vulnerable to this issue
[13:39:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:39:42] <karter> huh ??
[13:39:51] <duch_kazatel> that sentence doesn't make sense.
[13:40:09] <karter> duch_kazatel: nm
[13:40:56] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:41:31] <karl_pl> BillCriswell duch_kazatel : this is what im trying to do, but the fiddle is working properly. http://jsfiddle.net/2tzK9/
[13:42:00] <karl_pl> http://i.imgur.com/Lf4FxW4.png
[13:42:03] <jParkton> quick download it
[13:42:05] <jParkton> lol
[13:42:12] <tripflex> hey guys im trying to build a grunt file that will replace handlebars like vars in a file, i have the regex working fine im just having issues getting the replacement to use my custom imported data
[13:42:21] <tripflex> problem is im trying to reference the pkg object from the regex match but doesnt seem to be working
[13:42:30] <tripflex> http://pastebin.com/0NaQj8Va
[13:42:31] <duch_kazatel> tripflex might have more luck in #Node.js
[13:42:38] <duch_kazatel> karl_pl can you show us the raw data from your backend?
[13:42:46] <tripflex> ah good point ;-)
[13:44:11] <karl_pl> ahhh it looks like its being escaped
[13:44:37] <karl_pl> duch_kazatel: 	"test&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br ...;\ntest&lt;br /&gt;\ntest"
[13:44:45] <duch_kazatel> that'd be your problem.
[13:45:26] <karl_pl> now i feel dumb.
[13:45:27] <karl_pl> thanks!
[13:45:32] <duch_kazatel> :) np
[13:57:28] <relipse> what is a good jquery validation with pretty error messages next to each input box (i forgot the one I used a while back)
[13:58:24] <relipse> like form validation
[14:01:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryvalidation.org/ is a favorite.
[14:02:38] <relipse> http://formvalidator.net/#reg-form
[14:03:57] <duch_kazatel> sure why not.
[14:05:33] <relipse> oh yeah thats the one i used (your link)
[14:05:47] <relipse> they both are updated in github recently
[14:05:54] <relipse> but one has a ton of stars
[14:06:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the one I linked.
[14:13:31] <Matt_Ricketts> any experienced js coders have a couple mins for a question?  should be fairly simple for someone well versed I would imagine.
[14:13:42] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Matt_Ricketts
[14:13:42] <b-ot> Matt_Ricketts: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:16:33] <Matt_Ricketts> I have this block of code: http://pastebin.com/S51AJQYS
[14:16:41] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:17:06] <scri66le> d
[14:18:34] <Matt_Ricketts> I have two on click events, one nested inside the other.  When I click my Cancel Delete button, every time I click it the code runs exponentially more times with each click.
[14:18:57] <NoiseEee> because every time you click something with .cc-delete as a class, you're adding ANOTHER event handler
[14:19:11] <NoiseEee> take that second one out of that block, Matt_Ricketts
[14:19:18] <scri66le> how do I post my form data with this? -> http://pastebin.com/YL54ytya
[14:19:20] <NoiseEee> it should be a separate listener like the first
[14:19:43] <Matt_Ricketts> is it because I'm storing both event handlers inside the paretn #my-cards div?
[14:20:19] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: not 'storing', you're literally adding another event-handler for clicking 'input.noButton' every time someone clicks on .cc-delete
[14:20:39] <Matt_Ricketts> Thank you, that's starting to clear it up for me!
[14:21:00] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: so really you want something liek http://pastebin.com/Nv9S2J8Y
[14:21:23] <Matt_Ricketts> NoiseEee, the reason I put it inside that block was so that it could share the variables I've establish in that parent event handler.  Will I have to declare new variables if I take it out of the block?
[14:21:51] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: yep, you will
[14:22:22] <Matt_Ricketts> Hm, I was trying to be efficient...
[14:24:15] <Matt_Ricketts> Is it common to have to redeclare variables even if you'll be working with the same values all the time?
[14:25:24] <Matt_Ricketts> nvm, maybe I can get creative about that somehow.  But, thank you NoiseEee, I really appreciate the help!
[14:26:18] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: http://jsfiddle.net/WDn4W/nput.
[14:26:23] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: http://jsfiddle.net/WDn4W/
[14:26:44] <NoiseEee> single event handler, and then depending on what was clicked, you can do alternate things - thereby declaring your vars only once
[14:29:26] <NoiseEee> Matt_Ricketts: you follow?
[14:34:38] <Matt_Ricketts> looking now
[14:36:45] <NoiseEee> so you put some logic depending on what was clicked - if it was .cc-delete, you do your delPanel.slideDown;  if it was input.noButton, you do your delPanel.slideUp
[14:36:58] <NoiseEee> anyways good luck, im off
[14:46:16] <Matt_Ricketts> NoiseEee_:  yes!  thank you very much, seriously.  I'm off too.  Much appreciated!
[14:49:09] <duch_kazatel> weee
[15:01:44] <scri66le> how do I add my form data to this -> http://pastebin.com/YautffZ7
[15:22:16] <doskA> syborg -now i have dreamweaver cc Is any help there? my form is still of no use
[15:22:28] <duch_kazatel> dreamweaver :(
[15:23:17] <dshap> Hey all - anyone know if there’s a way to detect when the jQuery UI tooltip has “flipped” due to a collision, and perhaps add a special class?
[15:23:36] <dshap> I tried hooking into the open & create events but couldn’t find a way to determine if the tooltip had been flipped
[15:31:43] <dshap> i think im just gonna compare event.clientX/Y vs. the tooltip’s position to figure it out
[15:38:05] <doskA> am not a coder at all <duch_kazatel> :) it's been my help for a while.
[15:38:18] <duch_kazatel> step away from it as soon as you can.
[15:39:49] <doskA> in "other" fields am an embassador of every free. here I use that commercial version (of course  not bought)
[15:40:02] <duch_kazatel> that's not my objection.
[15:40:17] <doskA> so...
[15:40:52] <duch_kazatel> it's a terrible tool.
[15:41:19] <doskA> ;) ok. not even if am not programmer at all?
[15:42:00] <duch_kazatel> you are writing code
[15:43:10] <duch_kazatel> the drag and drop concept is pretty bad.
[15:43:18] <doskA> no, I read some, copy, and paste for my needs. >nyways. am looking the way an HTML array (draggable) can be sent -did not figure it all so far
[15:43:18] <duch_kazatel> the html and css it spits out are nightmares.
[15:43:36] <duch_kazatel> do what now?
[15:49:28] <doskA> it's quite confusing 4 me now.
[15:50:01] <doskA> tought that was the best way to have theese options sort and mailed
[15:50:04] <duch_kazatel> oh you were the dude with the LI you wanted to send along with a form.
[15:50:13] <doskA> yep
[15:50:21] <duch_kazatel> via ajax, right?
[15:51:19] <duch_kazatel> does each LI within that UL have an ID or something?
[15:53:06] <doskA> yes, every one has a class
[15:53:30] <duch_kazatel> what's the class then?
[15:53:35] <doskA> and a span with class
[15:53:48] <doskA>  <li class="ui-state-default"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-arrowthick-2-n-s"></span>Item 5</li>
[15:54:09] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[15:55:08] <duch_kazatel> can you add a class to each LI or an ID or class to the parent UL?
[15:55:23] <duch_kazatel> also, do you just have text inputs, or other kinds of form inputs?
[15:57:41] <doskA> yes, I can add IDs, and there is no more than 9 sortable fields (or images, whatever is in the LI)
[15:57:50] <duch_kazatel> i mean in the form.
[15:59:13] <doskA> only that
[15:59:28] <duch_kazatel> that's not answering my question, but I'll show you what I mean.
[16:00:03] <duch_kazatel> so one option is to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mVFY9/1/
[16:00:07] <doskA> it has <ul id="sortable">
[16:00:16] <doskA> checkin
[16:00:34] <duch_kazatel> and then you'd send formData back as your post body with ajax.
[16:00:44] <duch_kazatel> you should get the idea, though.
[16:01:28] <duch_kazatel> if order is actually critical with the LI items, they should each get an ID with an appended number and a class unique to only them.
[16:02:29] <doskA> I see, but is there need to have the text field you show in jsf?
[16:02:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:02:47] <duch_kazatel> i thought you said you have a form.
[16:02:54] <duch_kazatel> does the form have text fields in it?
[16:03:35] <duch_kazatel> because all this fiddle does is demonstrate how to combine all your data into an object you could send along to a server.
[16:03:52] <duch_kazatel> this will not be a copy/paste solution - this simply shows some basics.
[16:04:20] <doskA> Got it, Thanks, see here
[16:04:28] <doskA> there's my example so far
[16:04:34] <doskA> just the list
[16:05:12] <karamazov> I'm working on a plugin an so far it appends some images to a sidebar and I want to add an event for onClick for those images. I'm not sure where that'd go in the plugin?
[16:05:23] <duch_kazatel> okay, then remove the form and inputs and modify the logic so you don't rely on them any more, doskA
[16:05:39] <duch_kazatel> karamazov create a delegated event listener.
[16:05:45] <duch_kazatel> set it on the parent element
[16:06:10] <doskA> I'll see, Thanks
[16:06:14] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: I'll give that a google - thanks!
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> karamazov go check out the docs for .on() :)
[16:06:33] <duch_kazatel> there's a section about direct vs. delegated events.
[16:06:42] <karamazov> ha well I know how to do it outside of a plugin...just on in
[16:07:00] <doskA> ill be back wwhen I read More, and can "ask" something. Thanks a Lot
[16:12:29] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: In my plugin the meat of the logic is in "return this.each(function(element)[....] -- If I understand correctly, by attaching the listener in their it'll be "transferred"
[16:12:31] <karamazov> *?
[16:12:46] <duch_kazatel> don't attach in an each.
[16:12:55] <duch_kazatel> attach a single listener to a parent.
[16:13:03] <duch_kazatel> can you share what you have so far?
[16:13:20] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Yeah - can I PM it though?
[16:13:32] <duch_kazatel> if you can share it with me, you can share it in the channel ;)
[16:14:14] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Good point https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1216f4f47ba5888e22f6
[16:14:44] <duch_kazatel> btw don't use .attr()
[16:14:58] <karamazov> really?
[16:15:02] <duch_kazatel> use .prop()
[16:15:34] <karamazov> performance difference?
[16:15:47] <duch_kazatel> one modifies markup, the other modifies the DOM.
[16:15:50] <duch_kazatel> you want the latter :)
[16:16:18] <duch_kazatel> and you want to attach your event listener to $(this)
[16:16:19] <karamazov> ah! thank you - this is my first plugin attempt. I tried to make the code clean...not sure if I got the formatting right
[16:16:43] <duch_kazatel> so you'd do $(this).on('click', 'whateverTheChildSelectorIs', function() {});
[16:17:17] <karamazov> And that's outside of the each?
[16:17:21] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[16:17:36] <duch_kazatel> also, if you're going to use jquery, var $image = $(document.createElement('img')) is totally unnecessary.
[16:17:51] <karamazov> ha someone else told me it was faster
[16:18:16] <duch_kazatel> there's a tradeoff to doing that.  let me show you the cool way.
[16:18:38] <karamazov> I'm wanting to attach the event listener on the img. The function gets called on the element you want to add to and in this case it's a sidebar.
[16:18:49] <duch_kazatel> don't add it directly.
[16:18:58] <duch_kazatel> add it to the parent element instead and use a delegated listener.
[16:19:15] <karamazov> Ah I get it
[16:19:45] <karamazov> $(this) would be the sidebar I'm calling the function on and then I add it to the child I want
[16:20:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:20:15] <duch_kazatel> why are you adding $(this) to the child?
[16:21:07] <karamazov> I think I typed that wrong. The function is getting called on #sidebar so I was making sure that $this refers to the sidebar and that I'm attaching the listener to the images within the sidebar
[16:21:16] <duch_kazatel> no
[16:21:24] <duch_kazatel> you are attaching a delegated listener to the sidebar.
[16:21:36] <duch_kazatel> it listens for clicks on child elements that bubble up and hit it
[16:22:29] <karamazov> so it'd be $(this).on('click', 'img', function() {});
[16:22:49] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:23:05] <karamazov> Sweet - were you going to show me the cool way to add elements?
[16:23:13] <duch_kazatel> yep.  one se.c
[16:23:20] <karamazov> Awesome - thanks!

[16:24:53] <duch_kazatel> the reason you use the jquery way of doing it is because it'll create a fragment for you.
[16:25:27] <duch_kazatel> and operating against that fragment is much, MUCH faster than against the current document.
[16:25:45] <karamazov> That makes sense - thanks!
[16:26:37] <duch_kazatel>   window['person' + i] = { what's with the global var?
[16:27:26] <karamazov> I needed to create people objects that I could assign locaton, id, and their quotes.
[16:27:34] <karamazov> When their image is clicked their quote will change
[16:27:42] <duch_kazatel> scope that var to the function.
[16:27:47] <duch_kazatel> don't pollute the global space.
[16:27:57] <karamazov> I coud;dm
[16:28:13] <karamazov> I couldn't figure out how else to create dynamic names
[16:28:43] <duch_kazatel> just change window to another name.
[16:29:02] <duch_kazatel> var famousPeople - {};
[16:29:12] <duch_kazatel> then do famousPeople['person' + i] = {
[16:29:23] <djQuery> i hate floats
[16:29:44] <karamazov> Yeah, that's definitely more logical
[16:30:14] <duch_kazatel> what you're doing now is pushing those so they're global, which is bad practice.
[16:30:33] <karamazov> If I knew I was going global I wouldn't have done it - should have read more about window
[16:30:53] <duch_kazatel> basically, window is what everything else gets scoped under.
[16:30:59] <karamazov> I was just in a rush to get a dynamic name. Rushed code is never good.
[16:31:15] <karamazov> Did you mean to type famouspeople as a hash?
[16:31:17] <duch_kazatel> it's not about rushing, just about knowing :)
[16:31:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:31:30] <karamazov> var famousPeople - {};
[16:31:36] <duch_kazatel> javascript does not have hashes.
[16:31:38] <duch_kazatel> dunno what you mwan.
[16:31:40] <duch_kazatel> *mean.
[16:31:47] <karamazov> ha I'm coming from Ruby
[16:32:54] <duch_kazatel> JS objects are like hashes.
[16:33:09] <duch_kazatel> var famousPeople - {}; gives you an object.  that way you can have key/value stores
[16:33:15] <karamazov> yeah - it definitely feels that way. Prototypes are pretty neat.
[16:33:16] <uskerine> 73, (& jquery rocks)
[16:33:31] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with prototypes, karamazov
[16:33:41] <duch_kazatel> how else would you create an object?
[16:34:13] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: That was just an add on about javascript and the what objects can do
[16:34:19] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:34:28] <duch_kazatel> still confused by your hash question.
[16:34:50] <karamazov> I picked this up today and I'm still getting jumbled
[16:35:14] <duch_kazatel> err, var famousPeople = {};
[16:35:17] <duch_kazatel> not -
[16:35:30] <djQuery> karamazov, isn't a hash just an array
[16:35:42] <duch_kazatel> hashes are basically associative arrays.
[16:35:56] <karamazov> djQuery: yeah keys and values and order isn't important
[16:36:10] <duch_kazatel> yep, just like javascript objects.
[16:36:19] <duch_kazatel> well, plain objects.
[16:36:31] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: On a side note, was that code somewhat coherent?
[16:37:10] <duch_kazatel> relatively. some funky whitespaing, but that'd be resolved by doing the new element creation syntax I showed you earlier.
[16:37:35] <karamazov> I'll be adding that in
[16:38:08] <djQuery> var famousPeople = [{id: 1, name: 'George Carlin', img:'whatever.gif', qoutes: [{q: "Ever notice how you shit is stuff and other pepoles stuff is shit"}]]}
[16:38:20] <djQuery> might have left out some } or ]
[16:38:37] <duch_kazatel> djQuery he needs the named keys.
[16:38:42] <duch_kazatel> karamazov http://jsfiddle.net/5pn3K/
[16:38:45] <duch_kazatel> this is another suggestion.
[16:38:59] <duch_kazatel> declare all vars at the beginning of functions.
[16:39:05] <duch_kazatel> don't declare vars in i statements.
[16:39:09] <duch_kazatel> *if statements.
[16:39:20] <karamazov> Ah, thanks.
[16:39:48] <karamazov> literally take all the vars to the top?
[16:39:55] <duch_kazatel> not all.
[16:40:01] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/da9xW/1/#&togetherjs=Bn0JB6albg
[16:40:10] <duch_kazatel> just within a function.
[16:40:44] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[16:41:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6q4Xn/
[16:41:30] <duch_kazatel> see that last bit?
[16:41:37] <duch_kazatel> the this.each?
[16:41:58] <karamazov> yeah
[16:42:13] <duch_kazatel> basically, for loops don't create scope.  functions do.  so what the parser is doing is actually what i just did.
[16:42:24] <duch_kazatel> with some funk to account for trying to redeclare the var.
[16:42:46] <karamazov> Gotcha - so it's just better overall to write it how it'll be processed?
[16:43:05] <duch_kazatel> and it makes it easier to read later on - you'll know what vars are in what scope.
[16:43:17] <duch_kazatel> PLUS you'll remember to declare each var in the first place.
[16:43:22] <karamazov> Makes good sense. You said not to do var 1 = 0 in a for loop?
[16:43:33] <duch_kazatel> that's find, actually.
[16:43:35] <duch_kazatel> *fine
[16:44:00] <duch_kazatel> just don't do any var thing = 'blah'; once you're in there.
[16:44:23] <karamazov> ah yeah - forgot those don't come out unless returned to something
[16:44:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:44:43] <duch_kazatel> for loops don't have their own scope.
[16:44:45] <duch_kazatel> they
[16:44:50] <duch_kazatel> *they share the scope of the parent function.
[16:45:16] <karamazov> my mistake
[16:45:50] <duch_kazatel> it's all about learning :)
[16:45:53] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, I thought any var declared in the loop would not be inscope anymore once the loop ends
[16:46:08] <duch_kazatel> djQuery nope.
[16:46:20] <duch_kazatel> that's the case with .each(), but not for loops.
[16:46:25] <duch_kazatel> those are hoisted on up.
[16:46:34] <duch_kazatel> all vars are scoped to functions, not blocks.
[16:47:16] <karamazov> If I create the famousPeople object then I technically don't really need my array?
[16:47:26] <duch_kazatel> do what now?
[16:47:36] <karamazov> Ah nothing - confusing myself.
[16:47:53] <duch_kazatel> oh the square brackets?
[16:47:58] <djQuery> holly shit  http://jsbin.com/reculu/1/edit
[16:47:59] <uskerine> how do I change value of <h3></h3> item?
[16:48:14] <duch_kazatel> djQuery :)
[16:48:15] <uskerine> .val('myStuff') seems not to work
[16:48:21] <duch_kazatel> uskerine .text()
[16:48:24] <duch_kazatel> .val() is for inputs only.
[16:48:29] <djQuery> uskerine, .text .html take your pick
[16:48:29] <uskerine> good to know
[16:48:30] <uskerine> thans
[16:48:34] <uskerine> thanks
[16:48:43] <duch_kazatel> use .text() if it's just text, otherwise use .html() if there's markup.
[16:48:51] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, I so wanted to call bs on that one
[16:49:00] <duch_kazatel> djQuery :)
[16:49:23] <djQuery> I know I have done it before
[16:49:33] <djQuery> thinking they would just poof away
[16:49:37] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Thanks again for sorting me out - you just hyped my learning up.
[16:49:44] <duch_kazatel> jslint and jshint will both tell you to not do that.
[16:49:51] <duch_kazatel> karamazov my pleasure :)
[16:49:58] <duch_kazatel> always glad to make the web a slightly better place.
[16:50:01] <djQuery> gues I will need a self executing function to do my loop in
[16:50:11] <duch_kazatel> djQuery that could work.
[16:54:19] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: What's the method of creating elements the way you did called?
[16:55:16] <duch_kazatel> dunno if there's a name for it: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[16:56:23] <duch_kazatel> i felt dumb the first time i read that article - dunno what took me so long to read it
[16:56:44] <pcfreak30> If I have a json data set, and am using $.each, why is it casting a integer to a string data type?
[16:56:53] <karamazov> Cool thanks
[16:56:55] <duch_kazatel> don't use $.each() on json.
[16:57:08] <duch_kazatel> and it depends on what you're doing with the data.
[16:57:13] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: its a hash object
[16:57:15] <duch_kazatel> and the source data.
[16:57:20] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 that... doesn't change anything.
[16:57:42] <duch_kazatel> and actually, it's not.  it's just an object ;)
[16:57:50] <pcfreak30> im looping over an array/hash, and the value on console is a int, but its passing locally as a astring and trowing indexOf off
[16:58:00] <duch_kazatel> that statement makes no sense.
[16:58:04] <duch_kazatel> you can either have an array or an object.

[16:59:22] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel, you're on here all day
[16:59:45] <duch_kazatel> si.
[16:59:51] <duch_kazatel> too much probably.
[16:59:58] <jeffreylevesque> it's all good
[17:01:18] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 http://jsfiddle.net/LN39D/1/
[17:01:24] <duch_kazatel> for a little more detail.
[17:01:31] <duch_kazatel> but javascript doesn't have "hashes"
[17:03:26] <duch_kazatel> welp
[17:08:38] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: You know your stuff...got any recommended reading?
[17:09:48] <duch_kazatel> JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.
[17:10:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm working through JavaScript: The Good Parts.
[17:10:05] <duch_kazatel> and MDN is your best friend :)
[17:10:27] <karamazov> Perfect, thank you!
[17:21:40] <Whirl3d> I hate being this stupid. If you have this: var x=function () {}  then x.prototype.isSomething=function () {return true;}; what am I doing wrong the x.isSomething() is not a function?
[17:22:04] <duch_kazatel> you want var x = {};
[17:23:58] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/9qdA7/53/
[17:25:58] <jParkton> Whirl3d: call it like x.isSomething;
[17:26:08] <jParkton> does that work?
[17:34:54] <Whirl3d> thanks. I can't figure out when you use the prototype constructor. I want all "alignment" objects to have the .isAlignment() methods and declaring them directly is okay, why ever use .prototype?
[17:36:00] <duch_kazatel> if you're using a constructor function, you use it so all those objects have it.
[17:36:10] <duch_kazatel> but you can live life without constructors.
[17:36:32] <duch_kazatel> in fact, I'd argue that you probably don't need them for most web development/.
[17:42:04] <Whirl3d> I guess I am just unable to do this. Too old, I guess. I want to create a simple object that returns an x,y position relative to an element for use in alignment.
[17:42:41] <pcfreak30> Whirl3d: .offset()?
[17:42:55] <Whirl3d> much much more complicated than just offset.
[17:43:28] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: thing is I am using $.each. I know js doesnt have hashes but its the nearly same thing compared to other langs.
[17:43:38] <Whirl3d> I want to be able to use the syntax: $(elem1).alignTo($(elem2),"topLeft","bottomLeft");
[17:45:04] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Where would elem1 end up in that case?
[17:45:57] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 you don't need $.each() is what i'm saying.
[17:46:01] <duch_kazatel> in fact it'll be slower.
[17:46:10] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d you need to learn how to make a plugin.
[17:47:26] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: nvm, found another list wasnt cast to an int before looping.
[17:48:31] <pcfreak30> Now I have another issue. I have values 4 and 49. However even as an integer, it is throwing off indexOf.
[17:50:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:51:06] <pcfreak30> It seems as weird parse issue in that its skipping an item due to 4 in 49
[17:51:51] <duch_kazatel> no clue what you're talking about.
[17:52:31] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: I put the event listener inside .each on accident and it worked perfectly...now that I moved it out I can't get it to call.
[17:52:48] <duch_kazatel> what did you do inside the each?
[17:52:50] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: trying to make a fiddle
[17:53:20] <karamazov> In the each I assigned the elements...so I guess the each is the right place?
[17:53:41] <duch_kazatel> did you do $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[17:54:23] <karamazov> oh, I did $(this).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[17:54:32] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[17:54:50] <duch_kazatel> that will work, as long as $(this) is a parent of the child you're targeting.
[17:55:07] <duch_kazatel> iirc you want  $(this).on('click', 'img', function() {});
[17:55:22] <karamazov> Correct and that worked inside the each statement
[17:55:52] <duch_kazatel> then you have something funky going on.
[17:56:04] <karamazov> haha I wouldn't doubt it
[17:56:24] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i'm out.
[18:05:15] <jimi_> Anyone mine giving me a hand with this fiddle? My draggable images are going behind the droppable zone in panel 2.  I think its a z-inedex issue. http://jsfiddle.net/35r4K/
[18:06:18] <pcfreak30> Can anyone help me out with  a weird js indexOf issue and numbers?
[18:08:59] <systemfault> pcfreak30: What's weird with .indexOf beside that it returns -1 when an element isn't found?
[18:09:27] <pcfreak30> systemfault: https://store.topidea.com.au/index.php?route=product/bulkorder
[18:10:13] <pcfreak30> under test group, select test category, then corrugated
[18:10:45] <pcfreak30> and in console you will see it trying to filter things out. however between 4 and 49, even though they are both int, it acts up.
[18:12:48] <pcfreak30> only one item should be in the next select, but there are two and per console, it doesnt say good or bad on the last item due to an indexOf
[18:42:44] <Whirl3d> this has got to be an easy one: I have only one click handler for anchor elements and some simple, simple html. Click is not firing. http://jsfiddle.net/a3E5y/28/
[18:43:53] <donni> hi i need correction, i want to know if i do this right and will be no conflict in the future http://jsfiddle.net/BK5u9/1/
[18:44:41] <Whirl3d> donni, don't change your ids. That's rough.
[18:45:00] <Whirl3d> in your fiddle, add some html  so we can see what you are doing.
[18:45:51] <donni> Whirl3d it works here but i want to know if i'm not collecting a conflict code for the future use
[18:46:31] <donni> Whirl3d do you have idea if wrote that in a right way?
[18:46:39] <Whirl3d> I personally think it is a bad idea to change the ID attribute of your elements.
[18:47:05] <karamazov> I'm writing a plugin and I want to assign an event listener on all the elements my plugin creates. I was told that I'm not supposed to but it in the "return this.each( function(element) {" section.
[18:47:07] <Whirl3d> donni, put your html up in the panel above the javascript and we can see what you are doing.
[18:47:12] <karamazov> I'm not sure why
[18:48:08] <Whirl3d> because you are rewriting the event listener for every element in the list. Just write one event handler outside the list and listen to it there.
[18:48:15] <donni> Whirl3d well okay i will write the html
[18:48:31] <karamazov> When I do it outside of the each it's not getting called. Do I need call an init?
[18:49:24] <Whirl3d> karamazov, what would happen if you had 10000 elements you wanted to listen to? that's a lot of individual event listeners. If you setup one event listener and pass the event.target you can do it once for all your elements
[18:49:45] <Whirl3d> karamazov, what is the event?
[18:50:03] <donni> Whirl3d why itsnot good to change the attribut
[18:50:04] <karamazov> Whirl3d: Sorry, I'm not disagreeing. That makes great sense. I'm trying to call an on click
[18:50:57] <Whirl3d> karamazov, do you assign a class to your elements? that would make the overall event handler super easy. $(".class").on("click", function (e) {var targ=$(e.target);....});
[18:51:44] <Whirl3d> donni, because you can have only one instance of a particular ID on your page, you run the risk of duplicating IDs when you change them around.
[18:51:48] <karamazov> Whirl3d: Well, they're all images. I'll give that a try
[18:52:07] <Whirl3d> It's better to assign classes to elements
[18:52:16] <Whirl3d> Don't just try it with all images.
[18:52:21] <donni> Whirl3d which line is it?
[18:52:42] <Whirl3d> karamazov, in your plugin script, set a class on each image being passed. That's bettter than all images.
[18:53:20] <Whirl3d> donni, I'll write some comments on your code. brb
[18:53:34] <donni> Whirl3d thank you
[18:53:35] <karamazov> Whirl3d: Will do. The problem is nothing that the each the function is returning the each
[18:53:48] <karamazov> Ah so just assign it above..
[18:58:59] <Whirl3d> donni. All of it depends on your html. Copy and paste your html into a fiddle and report back.
[19:05:15] <Whirl3d> wow. I cannot figure out why my anchor is unreachable....http://jsbin.com/diroz/1/edit
[19:05:47] <Whirl3d> no js at all, but don't make me ask in #css...they are so hateful

[19:57:25] <bemoojigu> jQuery
[19:59:25] <donni> hi bemoojigu
[20:43:23] <The_Ball> djQuery, yesterday helped by suggesting "$('table').on('click', 'button.delete', function(){...}" how does this work exactly so $('table') references any table, and assigns function{...} to the 'click' event on any ids inside the table of 'button.delete'?
[20:43:44] <The_Ball> Or any <button id='delete'>?
[20:44:30] <djQuery> The_Ball,   <table><tr><td><button class="ball"
[20:47:23] <The_Ball> djQuery, did you mean class="delete"? in that case it makes sense
[20:47:48] <djQuery> The_Ball, lol yeah
[20:48:36] <The_Ball> thanks
[20:52:19] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/lawohu/2/edit
[20:52:24] <djQuery> The_Ball, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^66
[20:57:48] <scar> if i have an unordered list with the LI's display:block with a fixed width (%), how can i make sure each ROW has the same height? the rows change depending on screen size too
[20:59:37] <The_Ball> djQuery, awesome, thanks!
[21:01:41] <djQuery> scar, loop through each one and determin their hieght and check to see higher than the others you have checked then after going through all of them set them all to whatever the max height was?
[21:01:49] <The_Ball> djQuery, love the $tr.remove() at the end so many handy things one can do
[21:02:08] <djQuery> The_Ball, except it is not working
[21:02:25] <djQuery> oh forgot to add jquery doh
[21:02:27] <The_Ball> Is that because jquery isn't imported?
[21:04:51] <djQuery> and delete vs Delete
[21:07:00] <The_Ball> djinni, close, Deleteing ID:undefined
[21:07:30] <djQuery> The_Ball, yeah closet('tr') isnt working for some reason
[21:07:33] <djQuery> pissing me off
[21:07:49] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:09:01] <scar> djQuery, i suppose i'll need to determine the number of ones in each row too
[21:09:35] <djQuery> anyone wanna tell me why $(this).closest('tr') isnt working here http://jsbin.com/lawohu/3/edit
[21:09:55] <djQuery> scar, the number of whats in each row?
[21:10:14] <djQuery> scar, sorry had moved on
[21:10:33] <scar> the number of LI in each row
[21:10:44] <djQuery> scar no just the tallest one then you can set them all the same
[21:13:05] <djQuery> var maxsize = 0; $('li').each(function(){  var h = $(this).height; maxsize = (h<maxsize)?h:maxsize;}).height(mazsize);
[21:13:26] <djQuery> var maxsize = 0; $('li').each(function(){  var h = $(this).height(); maxsize = (h<maxsize)?h:maxsize;}).height(mazsize);
[21:13:49] <djQuery> scar, probably better to do it with css by setting them all to a percentage
[21:15:54] <The_Ball> djQuery, this works: http://jsbin.com/zozovubo/5/edit not sure if the link works for you though?
[21:26:16] <scar> hmm
[21:26:22] <scar> ok i suppose that's it then heh
[21:32:31] <djQuery> The_Ball, not working for me
[21:35:17] <djQuery> The_Ball, working now for some reason
[21:35:40] <The_Ball> djQuery, is it the version using function(event){  var $tr = $(event.target).closest('tr');
[21:36:03] <The_Ball> I guess $this isn't valid in that scope
[21:36:13] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/zozovubo/6/edit
[21:36:19] <The_Ball> or at least $this != event.target
[21:36:26] <djQuery> The_Ball, look at that 1
[21:36:47] <The_Ball> Yeah that works
[21:37:42] <The_Ball> I don't see the difference though
[21:38:17] <sflw> Hi guys, question about CORS: I am using OS X and I have Apache enabled and running a server on localhost. There are two JSON files in the WebServer/Documents/ directory and when I try to send an AJAX request to retrieve that information from a project in another directory on my local machine I get the following error: http://bpaste.net/show/6VO8FdIFRNdaksr4rSwn/. Do I really need CORS support on my local machine?
[21:38:28] <The_Ball> but it works, so excellent!
[21:38:52] <djQuery> The_Ball, give me a sec
[21:44:06] <djQuery> damit got an extra something somewheres
[21:48:17] <djQuery> The_Ball, http://jsbin.com/zozovubo/6/edit
[21:50:59] <djQuery> The_Ball, now here is somethign cool http://jsbin.com/zozovubo/6/edit
[21:51:02] <The_Ball> djQuery, too much awesomeness!
[21:51:53] <The_Ball> btw, using "var", does that make it global?
[21:52:16] <djQuery> The_Ball, no that prevents it from being global
[21:53:41] <djQuery> The_Ball, http://jsbin.com/linap/1/edit hit f12 then go to the console tab
[21:53:43] <The_Ball> So when $('table').... sets currentElem it makes it global, why is it declared with var in $(document).ready()?
[21:54:29] <djQuery> its still defined in the scope of the $(document).ready(function(){ it lives here});
[21:54:33] <The_Ball> Yeah, I see, x not defined
[21:54:49] <djQuery> The_Ball, are you ever going to have more than 1 table
[21:55:10] <The_Ball> djQuery, yeah, but only one button type with that class name
[21:55:48] <djQuery> The_Ball, it will still work if you have 100 tables
[21:57:05] <djQuery> <table data-delurl="product/delete/id
[21:58:08] <djQuery> <table data-delurl="product/id/details
[21:58:31] <The_Ball> djQuery, I'm actually using a <form> and will use jQuery to submit it if the user confirm the dialog
[21:59:13] <The_Ball> djQuery, is it "ok" to add arbitrary fields like "data-delurl"?
[22:00:04] <djQuery> The_Ball, as longs as they are prefixed with data
[22:00:25] <djQuery> The_Ball, http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[22:01:06] <djQuery> The_Ball, but people have been doing it forever
[22:02:10] <uealwq> I have this current code: http://pastebin.com/kHcz6mwD how would I output form results to the same page as input?
[22:02:59] <The_Ball> noted, thanks
[22:03:12] <djQuery> uealwq, might get better response on ##php
[22:03:31] <uealwq> djQuery, I was told I would need jquery to do this.
[22:04:07] <djQuery> uealwq, is it being posted with ajax?
[22:04:21] <djQuery> ?ajax
[22:04:45] <djQuery> the bot is always missing
[22:04:46] <uealwq> djQuery, Not that I am aware, I was just using HTML before
[22:05:10] <bePolite> Please how can I use jquery to ensure that all images in my site have been loaded before running a particular function
[22:05:18] <bePolite> All the images are in an img tag
[22:05:35] <djQuery> bePolite, onload doesnt work great for images
[22:05:41] <uealwq> djQuery, <form action="my-action.php" method="post"><input name="myInput"><button type="submit"></form>
[22:06:46] <djQuery> bePolite, http://stackoverflow.com/a/3877079/295800
[22:07:06] <djQuery> uealwq, have you ever used jquery? or javascript?
[22:07:43] <The_Ball> djQuery, I'm also puzzled by "var $tr = $(this).closest('tr');" why use $tr instead of just tr?
[22:07:55] <uealwq> djQuery, Never
[22:08:19] <djQuery> uealwq, then what you are asking is for us to do your work for you
[22:09:00] <uealwq> djQuery, I am not sure if I should use jquery.
[22:09:37] <djQuery> The_Ball, var x = 'some plain object', $t = $('.someelement') //this is a jquery object
[22:10:52] <djQuery> uealwq, Hey I've never ridden a bicylce before how do a i do a wheelie on a motorcycle
[22:11:47] <djQuery> uealwq, http://try.jquery.com for learning basics
[22:34:24] <The_Ball> djQuery, ah I see, thanks
[22:35:05] <djQuery> The_Ball, it is purely convention and has no impact on the code
[22:53:13] <mbuf> if I return a HTML table (data) from a Rails controller action in an AJAX request, how can I retrieve only the 'table' section from the data?
[22:53:40] <mbuf> using coffeescript
[22:55:47] <jeremyroe> Hey guys - new to jquery - currently trying to take a json result from PHP and place it in HTML - I have 5 objects created using an .each command but the best I've been able to do is an every growing unordered list with an appendto.  Any tips on the best way to create an ajax refreshing 5 row list?  I don't mind the research just need direction
[23:03:28] <pu239> http://jsfiddle.net/5xT56/ - i have two lists, i want to push a button (it's a link in the fiddle) and move one list under the one above it
[23:03:53] <pu239> works okay for the subitems, but how would i move item 2 to below item 1?
[23:05:08] <Cork> pu239: not sure what you mean
[23:05:34] <Cork> you want item 1 and 2 and then all sub items under item 2?
[23:05:54] <pu239> i want item 2 to be below sub item 3 (the fourth sub item under item 1)
[23:06:29] <pu239> i probably should have just gone to bed
[23:06:43] <pu239> i don't know if i make any sense at 2am
[23:06:59] <Cork> pu239: not sure what relation that makes
[23:07:12] <Cork> but just append it to the ul inside that li
[23:07:33] <Cork> pu239: sidenote, you should always start wit ha character (a-z) for ids
[23:07:38] <Cork> css doesn't support all number ids
[23:08:06] <pu239> ah, thanks, don't think i remembered that
[23:08:54] <Cork> pu239: what i fail to see is what logic is meant to put item 2 as a child to sub item 3?
[23:09:09] <Cork> or did you mean as a child of item 1?
[23:10:01] <pu239> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5xT56/2/
[23:10:14] <pu239> hopefully that helps
[23:10:29] <Cork> ah
[23:11:48] <Cork> so you want $('p' + parseInt($(this).data('data-id').slice(1), 10) + 1)
[23:12:01] <Cork> pu239: btw why do you need data-id when you have the same value in id?
[23:12:39] <pu239> i probably don't need it, i just simplified the example from some other code i had
[23:17:06] <Cork> pu239: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/5xT56/3/
[23:18:23] <Cork> wtf....
[23:18:33] <Cork> that should not be possible...
[23:19:06] <pu239> Cork: yes, that helps, i'll make sure i understand what it's doing
[23:19:36] <Cork> pu239: what totally messes with me is that it clones the element if you click sub 2...
[23:19:43] <Cork> (that should not be possible...!!!)
[23:20:49] <pu239> you've pointed me in the right direction, i'm going to call it a night
[23:21:01] <pu239> Cork: i really appreciate your help, thanks a lot
[23:22:02] <Cork> pu239: http://jsfiddle.net/5xT56/4/
[23:22:14] <Cork> it opps old code
[23:22:17] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5xT56/5/
[23:22:31] <pu239> thanks!
[23:22:40] <Cork> np
[23:26:37] <Woet> does someone know of something similar to http://bfowle.com/projects/web/timezone-picker/ written with jquery?
[23:26:58] <Woet> preferably with the same kind of vertical column design
[23:28:41] <Cork> ?g jquery timezone picker map
[23:28:43] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery and Imagemap Timezone Picker → http://timezonepicker.com/
[23:29:00] <Cork> tried googling?
[23:29:10] <Woet> Cork: yes, that one is not similar.
[23:30:01] <Woet> i need one that has vertical columns, is easily distinguishable and keeps your selection highlighted
[23:31:16] <Cork> Woet: showing a marker on a map for where a timezone is is quite complicated
[23:31:40] <Cork> especially as what timezone a region belongs to changes quite often
[23:31:55] <Cork> there is a reason why os installations has moved away from that
[23:32:04] <Woet> timezones don't change, DST only affects the time.
[23:32:20] <Woet> thats why it has the closest city, doesn't it?
[23:32:43] <Cork> if you mark timezone on a map from south to north
[23:32:47] <Cork> then yes it changes
[23:34:06] <Cork> <_<
[23:35:28] * Cork waits for the netsplit to calm down
[23:47:17] <Cork> Woet: so if you plan to show something like that you should depend on a service that has up to date timezone markers
[23:47:52] <Cork> especially as countries is cranky about showing wrong info (and can be quite incisive to have it fixed)
[23:49:39] <Cork> Woet: a hint of what i'm talking about http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png
