[00:11:03] <veQue> how to use this with a multiple calss selector?
[00:11:33] <veQue> $(this'.percent')
[00:13:02] <veQue> nvrmnd
[00:14:40] <tw2113> danheberden, i blame you
[00:14:59] <danheberden> tw2113: you'll have to get in line
[00:15:26] <gnarf> `ts
[00:15:26] <b-ot> gnarf: That's Sexualâ„¢
[00:15:33] <tw2113> somehow, i decided to read a little about backbone.js
[00:15:38] <tw2113> and suddenly it's 2am
[00:17:05] <veQue> tell me about it
[00:17:28] <veQue> there will be a day i will be a fast coder
[00:17:35] <veQue> but today is not that day
[00:18:00] <tw2113> eh, i wouldn't worry about the speed of your fingers as much as the speed of your code when running
[00:18:37] <danheberden> tw2113: so i suspect tomorrow night will be ember then?
[00:18:48] <tw2113> nah
[00:19:06] <tw2113> probably plain js with my books being here tomorrow
[00:19:07] <danheberden> tw2113: it's ok, i've been up mulling over deferred implementations and finally working out my thoughts on why i hate exceptions
[00:19:12] <danheberden> it's the bourbon, really, helps me be honest
[00:19:37] <tw2113> i had fireball whiskey earlier and it almost had me asleep at 9pm
[00:19:42] <veQue> $( $(this)'.percent') yeh it's 2am.. have  you seen my brain?
[00:19:52] <danheberden> tw2113: i think you mean melted cinnamon gummy beras
[00:19:55] <danheberden> *bears
[00:19:56] <tw2113> put myself on some client work and woke me up again
[00:20:07] <veQue> how do i do multiple selectors with this?
[00:20:19] <danheberden> veQue: "multiple"?
[00:20:27] <tw2113> comma separate
[00:20:30] <danheberden> or, like, $(this).find('.thething')
[00:20:50] <veQue> oh i have to use .find ?
[00:20:54] <danheberden> multiple would be like tw2113 said - $('selector1, selector2')
[00:21:00] <danheberden> veQue: depends - you trying to find shit inside of $(this)?
[00:21:16] <veQue> yes
[00:21:30] <danheberden> veQue: find, imho, is the bestest most explicit way
[00:21:36] <veQue> ok thanks
[00:21:40] <danheberden> you *can* do $( '.theThing', this )
[00:21:43] <danheberden> but, like, it's ugly
[00:21:48] <danheberden> and who likes ugly?
[00:21:50] <danheberden> i don't like ugly
[00:21:52] <tw2113> like your ex gf
[00:21:57] <danheberden> dude you don't even know
[00:21:59] <danheberden> like
[00:21:59] <tw2113> you just don't go back
[00:22:25] <danheberden> of course, that's assuming i date girls
[00:22:50] <tw2113> whoever you date, i don't care
[00:23:50] <danheberden> tw2113: whoever it was, they was ugly
[00:24:36] <tw2113> makes a limp pillow appealing :D
[00:25:06] <danheberden> or craigslist
[00:25:31] <tw2113> craigslist could use a backbone makoever
[00:25:41] <danheberden> now THATS the spirit
[00:26:53] <danheberden> i will say, for the record, that my last ex wasn't ugly - i'll keep my bad karma to the negative things i say truthfully, not in jest
[00:27:18] <veQue> ok that's not what i wanted. i have two elements <input id="One" class="setting money"> <input id="Two" class="setting percent">
[00:27:37] <danheberden> veQue: ah, you want to get its sibling
[00:27:41] <danheberden> yes?
[00:27:47] <tw2113> i'd probably have ex gf's if i ever managed to get a gf
[00:27:53] <veQue> hmm more like cousin
[00:28:10] <danheberden> ugh, cousins are a pain in the ass
[00:28:28] <danheberden> you gotta first find grandma and then look for the cousin
[00:28:42] <danheberden> veQue: i'm sure you're on api.jquery.com right now
[00:28:43] <tw2113> grandma got run over by a reindeer
[00:28:44] <danheberden> searching away
[00:28:51] <Cork> veQue: nextAll('input.setting').first() ?
[00:29:00] <Cork> is that what your trying to do?
[00:29:14] <danheberden> but i'll help you with these jQuery classics: .siblings, .find, .closest, parent
[00:29:35] <veQue> hmmm i think there's a better way to skin this cat
[00:29:49] <danheberden> and of course Cork pulling out the ol' (prev|next)(All|Until).(first|last)() trick
[00:29:52] <Cork> veQue: best way is to provide the dom structure you need
[00:30:15] <Cork> danheberden: cayse as long as its in the same parent its a good way to find them; ya
[00:30:20] <danheberden> veQue: if i can offer any advice to you dear sir, it's listen to Cork
[00:30:28] <Cork> *ya, cause as
[00:30:32] <danheberden> i apologize if you aren't a sir, btw
[00:30:44] <tw2113> danheberden, i'm stalking your twitter feed because it's what i do at 2:30am. Jory has an awesome sticker collection
[00:31:06] <danheberden> Cork: the only thing i dislike about that approach is it assume your dom structure never changes
[00:31:24] <veQue> yeh that might not work
[00:31:26] <danheberden> where as .parent().find('input.setting') might offer some more benefit
[00:31:42] <Cork> danheberden: well if you locate the element with a relation to the current element, that is what you need
[00:31:43] <danheberden> but, as you already stated, we're just talking in a vacuum until we know what that structure is
[00:31:59] <Cork> danheberden: as long as you look based on the dom structure you do have that problem
[00:32:02] <danheberden> Cork: i'm saying what if my damn designer is like "oh, i'll just put input.setting before the element
[00:32:03] <danheberden> "
[00:32:20] <danheberden> and then i have to explain to the cops why their blood is on my coat
[00:32:25] <danheberden> ... again.
[00:32:26] <Cork> danheberden: ah, well i have to generate the html my self so... ;)
[00:32:29] <tw2113> lols
[00:32:34] <Cork> and crop the images and so on
[00:32:42] <danheberden> Cork: oh they got you doing all the things
[00:32:45] <danheberden> i kind of miss those days
[00:32:46] <Cork> convert pdf's to svgs and so on
[00:32:51] <Cork> danheberden: yes
[00:33:27] <Cork> i feel closer to a graphicher then a developer now days >_>
[00:33:30] <veQue> i have "setting work percent" "setting work money" "setting other percent" "setting other money" "setting misc percent" "setting misc money" etc etc
[00:33:47] <Cork> veQue: the relation in the dom, not just the names
[00:33:50] <veQue> but is there a better way to structure pairs?
[00:33:59] <danheberden> veQue: just show us some html - like on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com or something
[00:34:00] <Cork> no classes is grate
[00:34:08] <veQue> ok
[00:34:17] <danheberden> SEND IS PICS!
[00:34:21] <danheberden> i mean, erm, codes
[00:34:25] <danheberden> wrong window,
[00:34:26] <danheberden> sorry
[00:34:36] <danheberden> "is pics"? really?
[00:35:14] <danheberden> i've been typing keys on a keyboard for 25 years
[00:35:21] <danheberden> and i mess up u and i?
[00:35:27] * danheberden throws entire office
[00:36:07] <Cork> veQue: but you might want something like var money = $('.setting.money'); money.eq(money.index(this) + 1)
[00:36:24] <Cork> that is an option if you only want to base it on the classes
[00:37:01] <danheberden> which, incidenally, is the same as $(this).nextAll('.setting.money').first() but keeps your selector out of it
[00:37:11] <danheberden> only to round out Cork's earlier point
[00:37:19] <Cork> danheberden: no not at all
[00:37:41] <Cork> it locates all settings.money elements in the dom then looks for where in the selection the current element is in
[00:37:42] <danheberden> getting the index+1 isn't the same as getting the next element?
[00:37:44] <Cork> then gives you the next one
[00:37:48] <Cork> no
[00:37:50] <danheberden> Cork: yes
[00:37:56] <Cork> its the next in the selection
[00:38:03] <Cork> it doens't care about the dom structure
[00:38:13] <danheberden> oh, i smell what you're stepping in
[00:38:18] <danheberden> i thought we were all siblings here
[00:38:25] <danheberden> apparently i missed something
[00:38:34] <Cork> nextAll only gives you the simlings the other gives you everything
[00:38:53] <danheberden> yes, i thought we were talking about.. oh nevermind
[00:39:41] <mazzachre> OK, I am a bit confused... items.wrapInner('<li>').wrap('<ul>')... Why does this not create a list of the original items? I am confuzzled
[00:40:34] <danheberden> ?eval $('<p>one</p><p>two</p>').wrapInner('<li>').wrap('<ul>').html()
[00:40:45] <danheberden> `eval $('<p>one</p><p>two</p>').wrapInner('<li>').wrap('<ul>').html()
[00:40:51] <Cork> bots down most of the time now days
[00:40:59] <Cork> and they don't have a dom so you can't do that
[00:41:01] <tw2113> time for bed for me
[00:41:01] <danheberden> but we had bo-t up
[00:41:05] <danheberden> where is bo-t
[00:41:15] <Cork> thats js > print("hello");
[00:41:20] <Cork> js> print("hello");
[00:41:20] <tw2113> night folks
[00:41:22] <danheberden> oh, b-ot
[00:41:22] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[00:41:36] <danheberden> js> $('<p>one</p><p>two</p>').wrapInner('<li>').wrap('<ul>').html()
[00:41:38] <Cork> tw2113: gnight
[00:41:39] <b-ot> danheberden: No output.
[00:41:44] <danheberden> b-ot atta boy
[00:41:55] <Cork> danheberden: it doens't have a dom, and you need print to see anything
[00:42:12] <Cork> also as far as i know it doens't have jquery
[00:42:17] <danheberden> if i could get my hands on the people that maintain this damn bot, i swear to god /cc rmill gf3 nlogax
[00:42:32] <gf3> Yo
[00:42:46] <danheberden> gf3, when will i see you?
[00:42:52] <gf3> danheberden: JSConf
[00:42:57] <danheberden> ITS TOO FAR AWAY
[00:43:00] <gf3> danheberden
[00:43:04] <gf3> danheberden!
[00:43:10] <gf3> danheberdennnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
[00:43:17] <danheberden> gf3, moving to "that other channel"
[00:43:25] <gf3> Roger that
[00:43:32] <raj> aside from what .autocomplete() already does, how can I also make it find 'Burger King' when a user types 'B K' or even 'K B'?
[00:43:36] <Cork> where is jsconf this year btw?
[00:44:21] <gf3> Eurasia
[00:44:21] <Cork> raj: not sure you can in js, if you use remote it would depend on the server
[00:44:37] <danheberden> Cork, it's in florida
[00:45:01] <raj> Cork, I have a set list
[00:45:02] <Cork> hmm, ya that is too far away...
[00:45:27] <Cork> raj: then i don't think you can
[00:45:29] <danheberden> it's funny, gf3 and i are like 600 miles apart, but are traveling to see eachother
[00:45:34] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/ZKt95/
[00:45:36] <danheberden> *3000 to
[00:45:40] <veQue> yehh
[00:46:01] <gf3> It's a love not measured by distance
[00:46:03] <veQue> i had a version working based off of strings of element names but that's not gonna fly
[00:46:29] <danheberden> gf3, unless you count the distance of... um, i mean
[00:46:53] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/ZKt95/1/ slight update
[00:46:58] <gf3> WOWâ€”is it warm in here or what?
[00:47:02] <Cork> raj: no, actually there looks like there is a way http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#folding
[00:47:18] <Cork> raj: you would have to make the regex wrapping you want, but it actually looks possible
[00:47:24] <Cork> damn, i'm impressed...
[00:49:40] <raj> Cork, I think I don't understand what to do
[00:49:45] <raj> I was looking at http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[00:49:49] <veQue> basically i want to type in percentage and get money and vise versa and obviously that last line of code is totally off in each if block
[00:50:05] <Cork> raj: check the view-source on that example
[00:50:08] <raj> oh, I see
[00:50:28] <raj> welp, I def don't know how to do that
[00:51:11] <Cork> veQue: so you want to you want to find .SET.money and .SET.percent and use that in the calculation you mean?
[00:51:25] <veQue> yes
[00:51:46] <veQue> per pair
[00:51:53] <Cork> per pair?
[00:52:00] <veQue> is there something even in the markup i can do?
[00:52:18] <Cork> yes if you have a crouping element it would make it simpler
[00:52:19] <veQue> work ->workMoney
[00:52:24] <veQue> etc etc
[00:52:38] <veQue> how do i do that?
[00:52:52] <veQue> grouping?
[00:53:05] <veQue> dvorak?
[00:53:07] <Cork> veQue: wrap the sets in something like <div class="work-set">
[00:53:23] <veQue> hmmm
[00:53:30] <Cork> then do $(this).closest('.work-set').find('.SET')
[00:53:37] <veQue> ok i think thats a good ideal
[00:56:50] <mazzachre> Hmm... ok, I found out how to do it... Is this really right? myitems.wrap('<li>').parent().wrapAll('<ul>'); It works and does what I want, but... it is a little spooky :D
[00:57:35] <Cork> mazzachre: ya, thats how wrap works
[00:58:18] <Cork> wrap returns the original object, not the new wrapper
[00:58:32] <Cork> so you need to move up the parent relation to wrapp it
[00:58:34] <mazzachre> Ya, I figured that out with some experimentation :)
[00:59:30] <Cork> what is myItems ?
[00:59:42] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/ZKt95/2/ Cork  ok  .. close
[00:59:50] <mazzachre> A jquery object of some items :)
[00:59:51] <veQue> just did it for top set
[01:00:04] <Cork> mazzachre: ok, so its dom elements?
[01:00:21] <Cork> mazzachre: simplest might be to just handle it all as strings if you can
[01:00:56] <mazzachre> Ya... I am wrapping up some submit buttons into a list, to hide them and show them in a selector pattern thingie
[01:00:57] <veQue> giving me same values in both
[01:02:19] <Cork> veQue: what element is it your looking for there?
[01:02:38] <Cork> also be careful ie doesn't support the input event
[01:03:09] <veQue> well if my this is the money i want it change the percentage
[01:03:17] <veQue> and vise versa
[01:03:34] <veQue> ie doesnt. ...oh that's just great
[01:03:41] <Cork> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKt95/3/
[01:04:04] <Cork> it will only work for the first element though
[01:04:14] <Cork> as its the only one that has a work-set parent
[01:04:55] <veQue> thanks. i dont know what you did different
[01:04:59] <veQue> but it works
[01:05:09] <Cork> veQue: i added the extra class in the .find selector
[01:05:15] <veQue> oh i see
[01:05:37] <Cork> if you want to base it on the dom you can use eq(0 or 1) instead
[01:05:38] <veQue> thanks a lot
[01:05:49] <Cork> but it depends on what dependency you feel you need
[01:05:56] <Cork> np
[01:06:36] <veQue> just a sidenote... with out the grouping in the markup...
[01:07:00] <optraz> hi, anyone know how to make the navigationbar fill the available height? http://pastebin.com/2eMbCCqi
[01:07:02] <veQue> theres probably no other better way?
[01:07:25] <Cork> veQue: well you could do $('.SET.money').eq(number)
[01:07:32] <Cork> but if you moved something it would break
[01:07:40] <veQue> just may markup is starting to look like ocean waves
[01:08:56] <veQue> k i'll just use grouping in the future
[01:09:22] <Cork> its how the dom is made to work, so its normally the simplest way to do it
[01:11:03] <Cork> veQue: alternatively you could add the grouping in the class instead
[01:11:21] <Cork> class="SET work money" and class="SET work percent"
[01:11:28] <Cork> then you could select directly on that
[01:11:43] <Cork> $('.SET.work.money') and $('.SET.work.percent')
[01:12:00] <Cork> and you could remove the wrapping div
[01:12:30] <veQue> so i'll have SET1 SET2 SET3 ?
[01:12:35] <Cork> you could have to concat the selector from the current element to solve that though
[01:12:46] <Cork> veQue: that could work too
[01:12:57] <Cork> the problem is you would have to identify it somehow
[01:13:07] <Cork> ex add a data-set to each element
[01:13:42] <Cork> so personally i prefer the parent solution, but its up to you
[01:13:48] <veQue> hmm wait
[01:13:51] <Cork> (less duplicated data)
[01:14:01] <veQue> i want that code to work for all sets
[01:14:23] <veQue> right now it's only gonna work for work-set even after i wrap the other two
[01:14:25] <Cork> it would but you would have to set what set each element belongs to, as a value you could use in the selector
[01:14:47] <Cork> veQue: no it will work as long as you call the wrapper the same
[01:15:04] <Cork> the name should not be uniq
[01:15:06] <veQue> oh. ohhh
[01:15:23] <veQue> so three wrappers all named the same
[01:15:28] <Cork> yes
[01:15:38] <Cork> thats the point
[01:16:03] <veQue> ok i got it now
[01:28:02] <bobby2411> hi .. i need some advice about the design and user interface of the following website codeshow.comli.com , the client says that "letters are not dark enough" "color is outdated"  Not eye-catching - still very dull. Can you suggest any improvements.
[01:31:14] <phrearch> bobby2411: try twitter bootstrap? saves you alot of work
[01:32:15] <phrearch> you can customize it easily when using the lesscss version
[01:32:24] <bobby2411> yeah..i was about to use it...
[01:32:46] <bobby2411> ru talking about less framework
[01:33:45] <bobby2411> yeah i regret that i didnt use less :( and twitter bootstrap..!!
[01:34:13] <phrearch> yea, lesscss
[01:34:36] <phrearch> works nice when your're building your site in nodejs
[01:35:13] <bobby2411> i mean he says that font color is dull .. i dont know what to do..!!
[01:35:45] <phrearch> im not a designer, sorry
[01:35:47] <bobby2411> yeah..im just getting started with nodejs..probably will it in my next project
[01:36:29] <bobby2411> hmm..thanks phrearch
[01:37:07] <phrearch> good luck!
[01:37:39] <phrearch> also, checkout the complimentary color guide for less
[01:37:43] <johanhar> no answer in #javascript so I'll try here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5046658
[01:37:52] <bobby2411> can you tell me any channels where i could get some advice on design..!!
[01:37:58] <phrearch> http://designshack.net/articles/css/10-less-css-examples-you-should-steal-for-your-projects/
[01:37:59] <johanhar> forums
[01:38:09] <phrearch> see point 10
[01:38:22] <phrearch> you can programatically generate colors that just 'look good'
[01:39:10] <phrearch> i find that one of the most awesome features of lesscss
[01:39:44] <bobby2411> yes..it could be done with less...man ..i should have used Less :(
[01:40:03] <phrearch> bobby2411: dunno about design specific channels
[01:40:29] <bobby2411> no worries..thanks mate for the advice
[01:41:41] <phrearch> sure np
[01:45:24] <basiclaser> can anyone point me in the right direction, i want to learn how to make a background go from black to white by scrolling down
[01:45:47] <basiclaser> (as you move down the page , it transitions to white)
[01:46:31] <Cork> basiclaser: just grab the scroll event
[01:46:40] <Cork> and then change the background color based on window.scrollTop
[01:46:56] <basiclaser> ok thanks, that doesn't really mean anything to me now but ill read about it :D
[01:47:48] <Cork> $(window).bind('scroll', function(event) { var color = window.scrollTop; $(document.body).css('background-color', color); });
[01:47:53] <Cork> basiclaser: ^
[01:48:04] <basiclaser> sweet!
[01:48:12] <Cork> that won't work though, as you need to convert the number to a real color
[01:48:17] <Cork> but everything else is there
[01:48:37] <basiclaser> do i set the second color in that function?
[01:48:47] <Cork> second color?
[01:48:55] <basiclaser> white > black
[01:49:12] <Cork> scrollTop == 0 should be the first color
[01:49:25] <Cork> and scrollTop == scrollHeight last color
[01:49:25] <basiclaser> o i c
[01:49:54] <Cork> scrollTop is how far you have scrolled from the top of the page
[01:52:50] <basiclaser> is there a way in this equation to make the first black color just transparent, so its essentially a fade in of white
[01:53:24] <Cork> ah, thats a good idea
[01:53:45] <Cork> set rgba(255, 255, 255, 0 - 1)
[01:53:46] <basiclaser> seems simpler
[01:53:59] <Cork> doesn't work in ie though :/
[01:54:03] <Cork> it uses argb
[01:54:07] <basiclaser> is the final value 'a' transparency or something>
[01:54:10] <Cork> #ffffff99
[01:54:16] <Cork> exactly
[01:54:27] <Cork> opps sorry its #99ffffff
[01:54:38] <basiclaser> what is that?
[01:54:46] <Cork> what ie uses
[01:55:07] <Cork> rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) === #99ffffff (ie)
[01:55:13] <Cork> rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) === #00ffffff (ie)
[01:55:59] <basiclaser> screw ie
[01:56:00] <basiclaser> :P
[01:56:58] <Cork> well its not that hard to fix
[01:57:11] <Cork> its just (alpha * 100)
[01:57:26] <Cork> and converting the rest to 16 basse
[01:57:29] <Cork> *base
[01:57:45] <Cork> can be done with two - three lines of code
[01:57:55] <Cork> (and you should do it)
[01:58:51] <basiclaser> so do you think i should do the fade in with the opacity attribute?
[01:59:13] <basiclaser> i think ill try to do that today
[02:01:23] <gazzwi86> does anyone know of a fully featured reliable form validation plugin?
[02:02:15] <Cork> basiclaser: opacity will fade the content too, so you can't use that
[02:02:29] <Cork> thats why you need alpha
[02:02:47] <Cork> gazzwi86: whats wrong with the normal one?
[02:02:56] <Cork> jquery.formvalidator ?
[02:05:01] <gazzwi86> Cork: I haven't every used a plugin for this before
[02:05:19] <Cork> gazzwi86: if you would have googled at all you would have found that one
[02:05:22] <gazzwi86> I tend to do my own regex, but its growing tiresome
[02:05:47] <gazzwi86> I was just after a recommendation
[02:05:51] <gazzwi86> I shall look into it
[02:06:12] <Cork> just the amount of links to that one would have been point enough ;)
[02:06:29] <gazzwi86> Cool, thanks!
[02:40:27] <Cork> ugg... ppl still write quirk mode html 3 pages (copyright ©2013)
[02:40:37] <Cork> that makes me want to cry! :/
[02:43:56] <_chrisftw_> sorry to be an idiot
[02:44:06] <_chrisftw_> but how do I call a function within jquery
[02:44:52] <_chrisftw_> this doenst work
[02:44:53] <_chrisftw_> http://pastebin.com/sm043zD3
[02:45:51] <NoWired> I know that this problem isn't with jquery, but, someone knows if is possible with raphaeljs know if a image (created with paper.image(path-to-jpg,...) was loaded before? because Raphaeljs doesn't show the same image 2 or more times at the same time (using it in differents divs with differents ids each one) ...
[02:49:05] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: You parse function's syntax is invalid, you should at least... syntaxically check your code for errors before showing it to us
[02:50:03] <_chrisftw_> soryr im just getting to grips with how to check my code - im using chrome and the developer extension - nothing seemed to show up though
[02:51:46] <systemfault> function parse(var  input) is wrong
[02:51:53] <systemfault> Should be function parse(input) {
[02:52:39] <_chrisftw_> perfect thanks man
[02:52:42] <_chrisftw_> one question
[02:52:51] <systemfault> Sure
[02:53:06] <_chrisftw_> can I make a webrequest to an api using the xmlhttprequest object or do I have to do that random JSONP stuff I dont quite understad?
[02:53:18] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Depends...
[02:53:35] <_chrisftw_> somehitng about crossdomain
[02:53:36] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: XHR are normally limited to the domain they're called from
[02:53:51] <_chrisftw_> so I cant do one from my computer to another website?
[02:53:58] <_chrisftw_> what about if its to an API?
[02:54:05] <systemfault> Unless you use CORS... but it's not supported by older browsers
[02:54:21] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Any usage of XHR is bound by the same origin policy
[02:54:32] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: JSONP is an ugly hack around that limitation
[02:54:48] <systemfault> CORS is the real workaround... but not supported on older browsers
[02:54:54] <_chrisftw_> CORS
[02:55:03] <Cork> cOrS
[02:55:03] <systemfault> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
[02:55:04] <_chrisftw_> ok so I should CORS to get back a simple JSON object form an external URL
[02:55:08] <Cork> ;P
[02:55:51] <Cork> _chrisftw_: you would have to wait a while for cors to be safe to use
[02:56:03] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: CORS is unusable on IE < 10
[02:56:04] <Cork> theres too many browsers on the market that don't support it yet
[02:56:09] <_chrisftw_> ah ok
[02:56:11] <_chrisftw_> so guys
[02:56:16] <Cork> and some mobile browsers
[02:56:23] <_chrisftw_> which is the simplest most common way to do this right now?
[02:56:30] <systemfault> So.. you're F'd with 1) Server side proxy 2) JSONP
[02:56:31] <_chrisftw_> I just need to pull an object out of an API in javascript
[02:56:40] <Cork> _chrisftw_: proxy it over your own server or jsonp
[02:56:44] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: For a single object, I'd proxy it
[02:57:01] <_chrisftw_> are we assuming I cant just do an xmlrequest to it?
[02:57:13] <Cork> or do it like i've seen... load a java app and do cors from there >_<
[02:57:16] <Cork> (bad joke)
[02:57:25] <_chrisftw_> I cant remember what option 1 is
[02:57:27] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Nope.. unless it's on the same domain, that's why you'd use a proxy on the same server
[02:57:43] <_chrisftw_> ok right
[02:57:50] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: You create a server-side controller... and the controller does the HTTP call
[02:57:50] <_chrisftw_> so its starting to look like JSONP
[02:58:12] <_chrisftw_> this is with JSON P right?
[02:58:20] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Depends... if the API you try to contact already supports JSONP, it's probably easier to just use it.
[02:58:28] <_chrisftw_> yes it does
[02:58:30] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: No, JSONP means JSON with Padding
[02:58:38] <_chrisftw_> right ok
[02:58:52] <_chrisftw_> API with JSONP should be accessible from a JSONP routine in my script, sitting on my laptop
[02:58:57] <_chrisftw_> right?
[02:59:01] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: right.
[02:59:08] <_chrisftw_> and I dont need any server side code
[02:59:22] <systemfault> Right.
[02:59:33] <_chrisftw_> gotit
[02:59:37] <_chrisftw_> Thanks guys
[02:59:41] <Cork> the scary part about jsonp is that your pulling and executing javascripts from that api
[02:59:41] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[02:59:45] <_chrisftw_> Off to learn my JSONP in an hour
[02:59:51] <systemfault> Cork: It's awful
[02:59:55] <Cork> it is
[03:00:03] <Cork> but... a hack is a hack
[03:00:07] <systemfault> And you're stuck with a single verb... GET :P
[03:00:27] <Cork> well hard to make a post from a <script src=""></script> tag
[03:00:39] <systemfault> Right
[03:15:49] <alaing> hi how do I catch the unload event on an iframe (i.e between page loads)
[03:16:47] <alaing> I've tried using .bind('unload',function(){}) on the iframe
[03:16:47] <discorpia> alaing: doesn't the iframe element have a reegular onload attribute?
[03:17:02] <discorpia> unload?
[03:17:13] <alaing> I've managed to catch the load
[03:17:35] <alaing> basically I want to display a "loading" gif
[03:17:45] <alaing> the iframe is in a modal
[03:18:01] <alaing> the modal contain and iframe and a loading gif
[03:19:00] <alaing> on first load of the modal, the loading gif is displayed and then when the iframe 'load' event fires it hides the loading img
[03:19:08] <alaing> now I'm trying to do the reverse
[03:19:28] <alaing> to display the loading img and then hide it when the iframe has loaded
[03:20:32] <dblosevn> hey anybody got asolution for delegating an image error handler, so that new images that are loaded via ajax can be auto replaced if the file doesnt exist? I already have code that will do this I just cant figure  a way to delegate it so I dont have to rebind the listners everytime content is updated via ajax
[03:24:30] <basiclaser> it is so annoying that the dom method and selector method have different ways of referring to elements, just one more thing for me to forget :D
[03:24:33] <dblosevn> alaing: that only works if the content in the iframe is same-orgin
[03:25:04] <dblosevn> you dont have access to dom even for cross-orgin requests in the iframe
[03:25:13] <dblosevn> *events
[03:28:38] <basiclaser> can someone help me nail a concept down, so you can navigate and manipulate elements using the DOM methods, and you can manipulate by using ID/class selector method. Is that right? are there any other methods i should know about?
[03:29:24] <dblosevn> alaing: I stand corrected ive actually done that before, $('iframe').load(function () { $.unblockUI();});
[03:29:34] <systemfault> basiclaser: You can do most manipulations using jQuery
[03:29:49] <systemfault> basiclaser: It's a DOM abstraction layer.
[03:30:09] <systemfault> basiclaser: Because you definitely DON'T want to deal with the pure DOM API
[03:30:10] <basiclaser> systemfault: what do you mean by 'jquery'  ? is that one of the methods i mentioned, or does it include both
[03:30:21] <basiclaser> ok
[03:30:44] <systemfault> basiclaser: Perhaps I'm not understanding the question properly.
[03:31:35] <basiclaser> i think that's where I've had the most trouble with learning, i haven't noticed when tutorials switch between different methods of nav/manipulating, so my understanding is a mix of different methods and thus i can't write just one of them very well
[03:31:55] <basiclaser> ill give you some examples from a book
[03:32:26] <systemfault> Sure.
[03:32:47] <basiclaser> " DOM method to select every <a> tag on the page, youâ€™d write this:
[03:32:48] <basiclaser> var linksList = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
[03:32:49] <basiclaser> With jQuery, youâ€™d write this:
[03:32:49] <basiclaser> var linksList = $('a');"
[03:32:52] <alaing> i'm back
[03:33:05] <alaing> dblosevn: it is from the same origin
[03:33:35] <dblosevn> alaing: as stated above it doesnt matter
[03:33:48] <basiclaser> systemfault: and maybe there is another separate syntax for manipulating and navigating in pure javascript? This is why i should just stick to one tutorial at a time :P
[03:33:53] <alaing> I have the $('iframe').bind('load',function(){ //hide loading img});
[03:33:58] <basiclaser> getting everything mixed up..
[03:34:17] <alaing> i thought if I add .bind('unload',function(){//show loading img});
[03:34:46] <systemfault> basiclaser: getElementsByTagName is one of the pure DOM APIs that jQuery abstracts
[03:34:58] <dblosevn> alaing: you shouldnt use bind, use on bind has been depreciated for quite a while
[03:34:58] <systemfault> basiclaser: Do you know CSS?
[03:35:16] <alaing> ok I#ll switch that to .on
[03:35:33] <systemfault> basiclaser: You cannot be good at jquery if you don't know CSS
[03:35:40] <dblosevn> alaing: ive never tryed attaching to unload in an iframe
[03:35:55] <systemfault> basiclaser: Because you're using CSS selectors to select nodes with jQuery.
[03:36:15] <shoky> dblosevn: bind ain't deprecated
[03:36:19] <dblosevn> honestly ive never really cared about unload in an iframe lol
[03:37:17] <alaing> dblosevn:  lol
[03:37:51] <alaing> me too :-D
[03:37:52] <basiclaser> systemfault: yeh i know css
[03:38:14] <basiclaser> i just wish there was only one method of manipulating the doc in jquery :P
[03:38:35] <systemfault> basiclaser: There's just $(selector) to select nodes in jquery.
[03:38:45] <basiclaser> ok thanks
[03:38:51] <basiclaser> writing that down :P
[03:39:09] <dblosevn> shoky: I stand corrected no its not, but since the addtion of .on the .bind seems pointless, I honestly thought I read not to use it anymore in the jquery api but it simply says .on is the preferred method now muh abad
[03:39:20] <alaing> let me ask over in #javascript
[03:39:45] <gotwig> how can I check a checkbox via its id in jQuery?
[03:39:56] <gotwig> toggle is the id
[03:40:00] <basiclaser> set it's value to true?
[03:40:07] <dblosevn> gotwig: $('checkboxselector').prop('checked', true);
[03:41:12] <gotwig> dblosevn: no
[03:41:19] <gotwig> http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/index.php check that page
[03:41:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: yes lol I do it all teh time
[03:41:26] <gotwig> if it would be checked, css would react
[03:41:49] <_chrisftw_> hi guys
[03:42:17] <_chrisftw_> nearly there - simple question - isntead of adding stuff to the attr of an element - how do I add it the contents of the element node?
[03:42:27] <_chrisftw_> IE     $("<p/>").attr("text", item.value).appendTo("#holder");          makes no sense
[03:42:29] <gotwig> dblosevn: css does not react to that..
[03:42:54] <dblosevn> gotwig: of course it does if you write your css selectors properly
[03:43:07] <gotwig> dblosevn: you see that I have a good selector
[03:43:19] <dblosevn> in this case ... #toggle:checked { //css attribs }
[03:43:43] <gotwig> oh I see
[03:43:51] <gotwig> I use jquery to implement css code for css4...
[03:43:55] <Cork> _chrisftw_: your looking for .text() .html, .append, .prepend
[03:43:57] <gotwig> so that would be a bug..?
[03:44:47] <shoky> dblosevn: yep its redundant now, but still in very heavy use, prolly will be a long time before its removed/deprecated if at all
[03:44:58] <dblosevn> gotwig: that background image looks horrible @ 1920x1080
[03:45:50] <gotwig> dblosevn: no
[03:46:19] <dblosevn> its blinding its so blurry lol, and how you going to tell me no lol im looking at it
[03:46:38] <gotwig> dblosevn: well, my css does not react. any clue?
[03:46:52] <gotwig> dblosevn: when you enter a wrong password, the panel should come down
[03:47:00] <gotwig> first site reload, then panel should come down
[03:47:21] <_chrisftw_> cheers cork
[03:47:37] <dblosevn> gotwig: whats the panel coming down got to do with a checkbox
[03:48:06] <gotwig> dblosevn: when the checkbox is checked, it should come down
[03:48:06] <gotwig> but it doesnt
[03:48:19] <gotwig> that "open menu" is a checkbox label
[03:48:24] <_chrisftw_> I am using .error(function () { alert("error"); })
[03:48:31] <_chrisftw_> but I need more iformation as to why it is failing
[03:48:34] <_chrisftw_> any ideas?
[03:48:41] <dblosevn> gotwig: wow why on earth would you use a checkbox there
[03:48:58] <gotwig> dblosevn: I think you are trolling here.
[03:50:05] <dblosevn> gotwig: i dont think youll be able to use css to trigger that alone
[03:50:30] <dblosevn> youll have to do something like $('#toggle').change(); in a dom ready listener
[03:50:33] <gotwig> dblosevn: dude that is css4
[03:50:41] <gotwig> which implements a parent selector
[03:54:59] <gotwig> the dudes in #css are not very modern guys..
[03:55:29] <dblosevn> maybe because css3 isnt widely supported yet much less css4
[03:55:29] <basiclaser> haha this site is hilarious, what a joke http://www.taller4u.com/sp/7760-taller4u
[03:56:15] <dogman> Hi
[03:57:01] <dblosevn> gotwig it appears in order to expand the menu the parent element needs a class added to it
[03:57:27] <dogman> I used http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/ (datepicker for twitter bootstrab). Now I migrate to datepicker jQuery UI
[03:57:48] <dblosevn> not sure if even css4 supports adding a class based on a selector
[03:57:54] <dogman> but this not working now: $('#id_laufzeit_bis').datepicker().on('changeDate', recalculate_deadline);
[03:58:16] <dogman> how to replace "changeDate" event from bootstrap-datepicker ?
[03:59:12] <Cork> gotwig: are you sure you mean css4?
[03:59:19] <Cork> :checked isn't css4 its css3
[03:59:32] <gotwig> Cork: could be.
[03:59:39] <gotwig> jjust saying, its not standardly available
[03:59:55] <Cork> css4 is barely in sketching state
[04:00:00] <dblosevn> ya but hes attempting to change a parent element based on a child thats like 3 levels deeper in the dom
[04:00:01] <gotwig> Cork: Parent Selector
[04:00:15] <Cork> there is no parent selectors in css
[04:00:20] <Cork> dom don't allow it
[04:00:24] <dblosevn> css3 doesnt support parent selctors at all
[04:00:36] <dblosevn> css4 is going  support them sort of
[04:01:02] <Cork> gotwig: i can point you to a long list of mail conversations when the implementors refuse to add parent selectors cause it would break things horribly
[04:01:10] <dblosevn> eg ul $li img { width: 300px;} would style li only if it contained img
[04:01:22] <gotwig> Cork: but it works for me
[04:01:31] <gotwig> I g2g
[04:01:32] <gotwig> thx
[04:01:38] <gotwig> dblosevn: keep it up :>
[04:01:39] <Cork> gotwig: btw what selector are you talking about that is a parent selector?
[04:01:48] <dblosevn> hes using +
[04:01:51] <_chrisftw_> i have a question
[04:01:55] <Cork> thats a sibling selector not parent
[04:02:01] <stabb> c0rk
[04:02:03] <dblosevn> i know :-)
[04:02:06] <gotwig> #toppanel! > #toggle:checked
[04:02:07] <_chrisftw_> if I want to pull this value from a JSON object : {"value":"http:\/\/lists.lib.plymouth.ac.uk\/items\/eoe3217-4","type":"uri"},{"value":"http:\/\/lists.lib.plymouth.ac.uk\/items\/eoe3217-5","type":"uri"}
[04:02:13] <gotwig> bye
[04:02:18] <Cork> gotwig: thats a direct child selector
[04:02:37] <_chrisftw_> would I do :     $.each(data.items, function (i, item) {           $("<p/>").text(item.value)
[04:02:46] <_chrisftw_> as in : item.value?
[04:02:47] <dblosevn> #toggle:checked + #menulabel:before
[04:03:33] <dblosevn> #menu label is 2 levels up the dom and down a node and like 2 children further then that lol
[04:03:33] <Cork> dblosevn: that would select #menulabel if its directly follows an input element that can be checked and has the id #toggle
[04:04:03] <Cork> _chrisftw_: what is it you want to do?
[04:04:16] <_chrisftw_> jsut pull the URL
[04:04:21] <_chrisftw_> :o
[04:04:37] <Cork> _chrisftw_: you want to create a p element and add the value to in and append it to? what?
[04:04:49] <_chrisftw_> oh some div
[04:05:19] <Cork> then ya that is what you should do
[04:05:48] <dblosevn> so cork you know of anyway to solve my problem lol
[04:06:00] <_chrisftw_> it seems to be firing
[04:06:04] <_chrisftw_> Error
[04:06:07] <_chrisftw_> I cant think why
[04:06:08] <Cork> dblosevn: and that is?
[04:06:09] <dblosevn> trying to delegate an image error listener
[04:06:15] <Cork> the two level up?
[04:06:31] <Cork> i don't think load errors bubble
[04:06:34] <dblosevn> no that was gotwigs thing
[04:06:39] <dblosevn> ya im finding this out
[04:06:41] <Cork> you would have to create a custom shim
[04:07:16] <dblosevn> seems wasteful to have to reattach the listener everytime I load content via ajax
[04:07:23] <Cork> dblosevn: one sec
[04:08:05] <Cork> dblosevn: well you would always have to have a selector on it
[04:08:14] <Cork> but $.event.special can solve it
[04:08:46] <Cork> dblosevn: http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/jquery-special-events/#api
[04:08:55] <dblosevn> I was thinking somethting like $('#ajax-content').on('error', 'img', function() {});
[04:08:59] <Cork> in the setup you bind an event, and in teardown you reomve them
[04:09:26] <dblosevn> #ajax-content will always exist
[04:09:28] <Cork> dblosevn: jquery already does this for ex. input elements and blur
[04:10:56] <Cork> dblosevn: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L543
[04:11:16] <Cork> opps wrong location
[04:11:29] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L689
[04:11:58] <Cork> dblosevn: thats almost exactly what you need to do
[04:12:52] <dblosevn> ah nice, so basically being the browser doesnt bubble the load event, jquery would simulate the bubble instead
[04:12:54] <Cork> (except that it would be for the error event and possibly filtered to img elements
[04:13:06] <Cork> dblosevn: yes
[04:17:45] <Nebros> i have here a form: http://jsfiddle.net/JU775/ and i dont know what i have to do if i will have this "input" field activ when the page is loadet... can someone help me?
[04:19:45] <dblosevn> Nebros: http://jsfiddle.net/JU775/1/
[04:21:20] <Nebros> $('input[name="regexp"]').focus(); is this line all? it looks a bit simple. :D
[04:21:36] <dblosevn> Nebros: kinda cause it was simple lol
[04:22:59] <_chrisftw_> guise
[04:23:02] <_chrisftw_> waht does this mean
[04:23:03] <_chrisftw_> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://lists.broadminsteruniversity.org/isbn/0070167265/lists.json?cb=JSONP. Origin http://localhost:63874 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. JQuery_JSON_Parser.htm:1
[04:23:44] <sacho> you're not allowed to do cross-domain requests from localhost to that domain.
[04:24:02] <Nebros> dblosevn: it works, thank you very much. =)
[04:24:41] <dblosevn> np
[04:24:45] <sacho> _chrisftw_, you can google CORS(cross origin resource sharing) for more information.
[04:25:10] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: You need to tell jquery that it's jsonp and specify the name of the callback in certain cases
[04:25:11] <_chrisftw_> but but im using JSONP ...
[04:25:22] <dblosevn> ovisouly not lol
[04:25:35] <_chrisftw_> errr halp
[04:25:51] <dblosevn> ?demo @ _chrisftw_
[04:25:51] <b-ot> _chrisftw_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:25:59] <sacho> you're using an xmlhttprequest, not jsonp.
[04:26:47] <Cork> _chrisftw_: are you using jquery for your call?
[04:26:58] <_chrisftw_> uuugh
[04:27:03] <_chrisftw_> yes
[04:27:14] <_chrisftw_>  $.getJSON
[04:27:18] <sacho> perhaps you want to read on how jsonp works.
[04:27:21] <_chrisftw_> have I done goofed
[04:27:25] <_chrisftw_> alrightey then
[04:27:26] <Cork> _chrisftw_: can the server handle sending jsonp to a specific function?
[04:27:29] <_chrisftw_> brb going go read
[04:27:37] <_chrisftw_> yes yes it can
[04:27:47] <sacho> if you have any specific questions, I'd love to hear them
[04:27:52] <Cork> then just set &callback=?
[04:27:56] <Cork> and then end of your url
[04:27:57] <dblosevn> Cork: ya the service responds with jsonp
[04:27:59] <Cork> that should be all
[04:28:08] <dblosevn> the callback variable is cb
[04:28:27] <Cork> and it sets what function if will call with the response?
[04:28:36] <Cork> looked like it only made it return jsonp
[04:28:40] <dblosevn> http://lists.broadminsteruniversity.org/isbn/0070167265/lists.json?cb=mycallback
[04:28:43] <Cork> as its value was JSONP
[04:28:50] <pSouper> howdy doody all
[04:28:56] <Cork> hmm
[04:29:14] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: http://jsfiddle.net/5wwr8/
[04:29:29] <dblosevn> think somebody needs to talk standards to that site lol
[04:30:05] <pSouper> would anyone know how to collect all the values from all the elements with a 'data-mydata' attribute as a single array? so i can normalise them
[04:30:14] * sacho shakes fist at query
[04:30:19] <sacho> jquery*
[04:30:38] <systemfault> pSouper: var elements = $('[data-mydata]');
[04:30:39] <pSouper> the normalising i can do - i'm just struggling to get the values
[04:30:52] <Sendoushi> front end developer or front-end developer?
[04:31:01] <pSouper> really systemfault - dowsers so simple
[04:31:04] <pSouper> thnkas
[04:31:17] <dblosevn> pSouper: $('*[data-mydata]').each() would work etter without the * if you know what type of element it will have
[04:31:19] <systemfault> pSouper: that will return the elements themselves, not their value
[04:31:40] <pSouper> so i'll loop the array and work on the values - np
[04:31:58] <pSouper> thanks for the help systemfault  -appreciated
[04:32:10] <Cork> also var mydata = $.map($('[data-mydata]'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('mydata'); });
[04:32:11] <systemfault> You're welcome
[04:32:14] <dblosevn> eg... $('div[data-mydata]') would be faster
[04:32:14] <Cork> pSouper: ^
[04:32:38] <pSouper> thanks guys
[04:32:44] <dblosevn> if the elements that held that data element were divs
[04:32:49] <Cork> and ya looping over attributes is quite slow
[04:32:51] <pSouper> ;)
[04:33:00] <coling> Hi guys... trying to work out a weird issue.... using jquery UI 1.10.1 and $.dialog() it seems the $.button() created for the close button doesn't have it's _create() method called... this means the close button doesn't seem to get it's classes set correctly.
[04:33:08] <coling> Anyone seen anythign similar?
[04:34:32] <dblosevn> I have noticed something that seems weird to me about data- selectors, if you set the data via jquery you cant select the elements with a selector, however if you set the data- attrib with jquery it can be access by .data as well as via aselector, havent really figured that one out yet
[04:35:12] <Cork> dblosevn: .data uses $._data witch uses a plain object with the dom id as a key
[04:35:21] <dblosevn> it seems that $('selector').data('myvar', 'value') doesnt update the data attrib
[04:35:24] <Cork> if the key is missing it pulls in atributes with -data
[04:35:25] <pSouper> worked a treat guys, thank you al
[04:35:27] <pSouper> all
[04:35:28] <Cork> *data-
[04:35:33] <systemfault> dblosevn: exactly.. that's the whole point
[04:35:36] <Cork> thats why you get that effect
[04:35:57] <systemfault> dblosevn: You want to use .data instead of attributes because changing the DOM is slow.
[04:36:14] <dblosevn> but $('selector').attrib('data-myvar', 'value') can be both selected and retreived via .data
[04:36:16] <Cork> and .data does parsing that you don't want to do each time
[04:36:23] <Cork> and data can store much more then an attibute can
[04:36:44] <systemfault> dblosevn: Nope, cannot be setted
[04:37:06] <Cork> systemfault: read again :)
[04:37:13] <Cork> selected not setted ;)
[04:37:16] <systemfault> Ah oops :/
[04:37:24] <dblosevn> the only downfall ive seen on using the data- attrib is the type is always string
[04:37:37] <Cork> dblosevn: exactly
[04:37:41] <dblosevn> if you need an int or bool it just doesnt work
[04:37:44] <Cork> and thats a big downfall compared to .data
[04:37:58] <Cork> or object, or any form of reference
[04:38:00] <systemfault> dblosevn: In practice, you should avoid the usage of attr() if possible...
[04:38:01] <dblosevn> have to type cast before you use the value
[04:38:22] <Cork> dblosevn: no many values can't be stored in an attribute at all
[04:38:28] <dblosevn> ya, i rarely need to select based on data- attribs
[04:39:08] <_chrisftw_> Hi Cork - please take a look - http://jsfiddle.net/fD6f7/
[04:39:11] <Cork> dblosevn: $(this).nextAll('input') try to store that in an attribute
[04:39:35] <Cork> _chrisftw_: s/jsonp: 'JSONP'/jsonp: 'cb'/
[04:39:53] <dblosevn> ive had a couple instances where it made sense, but mainly i just use .data to store addtioanl info that is needed for ajax querys so theres rarely a need to select based on them
[04:40:01] <sacho> syntax error
[04:40:35] <motka> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112067/how-does-jquery-on-work
[04:40:44] <Cork> dblosevn: if you find your self needing to use that, you most of the time should have a class
[04:41:05] <Cork> cause selecting on attributes is most of the time a horrible idea
[04:41:05] <systemfault> motka: not at all
[04:41:27] <sacho> motka, no, when there is need of delegation, event listeners are simply placed higher up the dom tree.
[04:41:33] <_chrisftw_> sorry Cork dont quite follow
[04:41:38] <coling> If I rename "ui.button" to "ui.button2" and adjust the calls accordingly it works :D Something must be overriding $.button..... time to track it down.
[04:41:42] <sacho> in fact, it is you that dictates where they are placed(the whole point of on is making that explicit)
[04:41:53] <motka> well I cannot understand how it works
[04:41:54] <Cork> motka: it depends on doma default bubbling behavior
[04:41:56] <dblosevn> eg... $('a.manage').click(function() { $el = $('div[data-product-id="'+$(this).data('product-id')_']');
[04:41:56] <systemfault> motka: normal events work with addEventListener bound directly on the node, event delegation uses bubbling
[04:42:04] <motka> is there a non-jquery example how it can be done?
[04:42:11] <johnkpaul> motka: http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[04:42:17] <Cork> motka: events trigger on the target element, then it bubbles up the tree from parent to parent
[04:43:32] <Cork> motka: document.body.addEventListener(function(event) { if(!event.target.classList.include('match')) { return } /* handler */ })
[04:43:44] <motka> aha!
[04:43:47] <Cork> motka: not sure the function call is include, but treat it as psudo code
[04:43:54] <motka> so that EventListener will ALWAYS listen
[04:44:00] <Cork> yes
[04:44:02] <motka> and be appended to all elements
[04:44:03] <Cork> uh...
[04:44:05] <Cork> no
[04:44:12] <Cork> there is one for each time you add an event listener
[04:44:13] <motka> wait please
[04:44:20] <Cork> but it will listen on an existing element
[04:44:22] <motka> well I am interested
[04:44:27] <motka> if I have this:
[04:44:54] <motka> document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0].addEventListener(function(event) { if(!event.target.classList.include('match')) { return } /* handler */ })
[04:44:55] * Cork waits for a long flood of code to enter the channel...
[04:44:57] <Cork> ah
[04:44:59] <motka> and if I create another button
[04:45:08] <Cork> it won't match
[04:45:08] <motka> programmatically and insert/append it to the current DOM
[04:45:27] <motka> will that event handler be delegated to that new element of the same type, and selector ?
[04:45:43] <Cork> no
[04:45:46] <Cork> motka: when you add a button and you have the structure <html><body><div><p><form><button>
[04:45:55] <Cork> then button is clicked, the event fires on button
[04:46:15] <Cork> after that even is done, the doms bubble action kicks in and triggers the same event on form
[04:46:28] <Cork> then follows on div, body and last html (document)
[04:46:38] <Cork> so if you bind it on document you will always get it
[04:46:46] <coling> Ahh it's feckin bootstrap... known issue: *sigh* https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/6094
[04:46:47] <b-ot> coling: Issue #6094 by virtuecenter (2mon 3w ago): Conflict between bootstrap-button.js (v2.2.1) and jQuery UI (1.9.2)
[04:46:50] <Cork> cause the event will bubble up there from the real element
[04:46:53] * coling toddles off to sort it out.
[04:47:19] <Cork> motka: so delegation works by listning for bubbling events
[04:47:34] <Cork> and not binding directly on the target element
[04:49:15] <Cork> motka: you should prob grad up on http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[04:49:22] <systemfault> Hmm, is there a pure DOM way of doing .is ?
[04:49:27] <Cork> they do a really good job of explaining how events work
[04:50:01] <motka> yes, I see more clear picture now
[04:50:02] <systemfault> I mean, we have querySelector(All) to get nodes with pure DOM but is there a way to test a node the way .is does it with jQuery
[04:50:14] <motka> I will still read the quirksmode article about it
[04:50:16] <motka> thanks Cork
[04:50:21] <Cork> systemfault: node.parentNode.querySelector() == node
[04:50:41] <Cork> systemfault: is does it that way
[04:50:51] <Cork> it checks if the node is itself
[04:51:41] <systemfault> Cork: Ah, good to know
[04:51:56] <_chrisftw_> I will give 0.1 BTC to whoever gets this to work http://jsfiddle.net/fD6f7/2/
[04:52:15] <_chrisftw_> *shame*
[04:52:59] <Cork> systemfault: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L62
[04:53:00] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Dude.. I pasted you a working example.
[04:53:10] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: http://jsfiddle.net/5wwr8/
[04:54:12] <_chrisftw_> It doesn't seem to return anything
[04:54:20] <_chrisftw_> D: <--- noob
[04:54:31] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: Do you have your development console opened?
[04:54:40] <systemfault> If not... of course it won't work.
[04:54:40] <_chrisftw_> yep
[04:54:44] <duderion> _chrisftw_: you have hhttp <- one h too much
[04:54:50] <duderion> and the function(data) needs a name
[04:54:59] <duderion> function myfunc(data) {
[04:54:59] <systemfault> _chrisftw_: You're not seeing "Object" being printed in the console?
[04:56:03] <_chrisftw_> ah dang it
[04:56:08] <_chrisftw_> you are right
[04:56:23] <_chrisftw_> ok system you get the BTC just pm your address = ) - thanks man
[04:56:31] <Cork> ...
[04:56:40] <_chrisftw_> lol i was just about to say
[04:56:44] <_chrisftw_> you too Cork lol
[04:56:51] <_chrisftw_> good times ;)
[04:56:58] <Cork> _chrisftw_: systemfault helped and fixed it for like 15 mins ago...
[04:57:00] <_chrisftw_> seriosuly thanks guys
[04:57:16] <systemfault> You're welcome
[04:57:33] <_chrisftw_> yep im just taking care of my girlfriend so my mind isnt fully on this
[04:57:53] <_chrisftw_> cool - also I didnt realise I needed my console open
[04:58:02] <_chrisftw_> *shame*
[04:58:13] <Cork> you should always have it open, if nothing else to see errors
[04:58:24] <Cork> (that you would have gotten from your code)
[04:58:49] <pehlert> Hey folks. I use PJAX for push/popstate enabled AJAX pageloads. Now when I use the back button, it takes the previously saved page from a cache. When this happens, jQuery doesn't seem to parse the DOM and can't find the new nodes.. Is there a way to "reinitialize" jQuery?
[04:59:29] <systemfault> pehlert: You mean you killed your event handlers?
[04:59:41] <Cork> he prob serialized the content
[04:59:47] <Cork> and saved it as html
[04:59:57] <Cork> == all js information is dead
[04:59:59] <sacho> your back button actually loads html via ajax?
[05:00:21] <systemfault> Why not?
[05:00:28] <dblosevn> mine does ;-)
[05:00:30] <sacho> I didn't know it could do that
[05:00:40] <Cork> only if you fix it by js
[05:00:46] <Cork> natively it can't
[05:00:56] <sacho> still didn't think you could hijack its functionality(unless it's an extension?)
[05:01:12] <Cork> sacho: 't seem to parse the DOM and can't find the new nodes.. Is there a way to "reinitialize" jQuery?
[05:01:13] <Cork> opps
[05:01:19] <pehlert> systemfault: Well, the problem is that when using the back button with pjax, my custom click and hover handlers don't work anymore. bxSlider on the other hand which is initialized the same way still works.. I am not sure why this happens to be honest
[05:01:22] <Cork> sacho: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onpopstate
[05:01:42] <sacho> ah, I see
[05:01:43] <Cork> man how did i get that into my copy buffer...
[05:02:10] <dblosevn> my whole interface is ajax, and completely naviagateable via the back and forwarbuttons as well as unique urls for every screen in the app lol
[05:02:17] <Cork> sacho: it only triggers if you've used window.pushState before
[05:02:53] <systemfault> dblosevn: That's it, people spreading the FUD that ajax websites break the back button are wrong ;)
[05:03:08] <sacho> pehlert, if you're replacing the dom, are you placing your event listeners again?
[05:03:14] <Cork> systemfault: well it was true if you went back just a few years
[05:03:18] <dblosevn> Yep my admin panel is definitely crawlable lol
[05:03:18] <Cork> or into ie
[05:03:19] <pehlert> Cork: That may have happened, yes.. But I wonder why my slider still works and the custom click/hover handlers don't
[05:03:19] <sacho> perhaps bxslider works because you don't replace its part of the dom.
[05:03:32] <sacho> hence, its listeners are still intact
[05:03:47] <Cork> pehlert: you might have serialized inline script tags?
[05:03:56] <pehlert> sacho: I do replace it as well
[05:04:02] <Ivru> Hello. Using jquery-latest, I'm unable to acces the response headers from an ajax call (using getResponseHeader('myHeader')). Any idea why ?
[05:04:05] <dblosevn> the only thing i havent been able to quite get to work right is my jquery ui tabs state
[05:04:24] <Cork> Ivru: from where?
[05:04:31] <Ivru> Cork, succes CB
[05:04:35] <Ivru> success*
[05:04:40] <dblosevn> it will go back to the right content panel but if you were in a tab it goes back to the first tab on page load
[05:04:52] <Cork> Ivru: through the jqXHR object?
[05:05:03] <Ivru> Cork, yep
[05:05:19] <dblosevn> ill have to check this push/pop thing out, im using hashchange right now
[05:05:20] <Cork> hmm
[05:05:29] <pehlert> Cork: No, I replaced the inline script tags.. Now I am trying to reinitialize the handlers in the onpopstate event, but jQuery doesn't find the respective DOM elements at that state anymore.. Maybe I should just disable pjax caching, but as it's a rather popular library, I thought the problem could be on my end
[05:05:33] <Ivru> using firefox or chrome
[05:05:54] <Cork> dblosevn: hashchange is a hack; it constantly check whats in window.localtion.hash
[05:06:03] <Cork> dblosevn: through a setInterval
[05:06:03] <dblosevn> only in ie
[05:06:15] <dblosevn> most browsers support it natively now
[05:06:21] <Cork> dblosevn: you will have to keep that for ie
[05:06:31] <Cork> it doesn't support pushState/popStage
[05:06:32] <dblosevn> chrome firefox safari being most
[05:06:33] <Cork> *stage
[05:06:36] <Cork> BAH
[05:06:39] <Cork> *state
[05:07:11] <dblosevn> ie < 10 doesnt support hashchange
[05:07:21] <dblosevn> it is implemented in 10 though
[05:07:28] <systemfault> ALREADY?!
[05:07:30] <systemfault> ;)
[05:07:39] <Cork> and ie will take for ever to be used my most ie users
[05:07:55] <Cork> as it only works on win2012 and the like
[05:08:10] <Cork> (win7 sp1 is an exception)
[05:08:17] <dblosevn> yeppers and ms screwed us giving XP yet another year of support
[05:08:24] <systemfault> dblosevn: What?
[05:08:28] <dblosevn> yep
[05:08:28] <Cork> won't work on vista, or xp or windows 2008
[05:08:33] <dblosevn> 2014 now
[05:08:35] <systemfault> dblosevn: XP still dies on April 8th 2014 AFAIK
[05:08:44] <Cork> ya it does
[05:08:45] <dblosevn> it was supossed to die this year
[05:08:52] <Cork> not likely
[05:09:04] <dblosevn> and in 2010 and 2011 and 1012
[05:09:06] <Cork> it will most likely only die in 2015 at first
[05:09:21] <dblosevn> -1012 + 2012
[05:09:23] <Ivru> Cork, using firebug I can see the header response in the console. But from the jqXHR object, nothing...
[05:09:28] <Cork> and ppl will complain vigorously
[05:09:47] <systemfault> Too bad for them.
[05:09:49] <dblosevn> they did remove support for ie6 already though, about time
[05:09:57] <systemfault> dblosevn: They can't.
[05:10:06] <dblosevn> most peops that run updates in xp cant have ie6
[05:10:12] <dblosevn> xp sp3 includes ie7
[05:10:40] <systemfault> dblosevn: There must be a way to disable the IE update.
[05:11:00] <dblosevn> ya dont install sp3 lol
[05:11:05] <Cork> Ivru: can't see a reason why it wouldn't work
[05:11:47] <gotwig> dblosevn: hey
[05:11:54] <systemfault> dblosevn: I mean.. it's IMPOSSIBLE to not be able to install SP3 without IE7
[05:11:57] <gotwig> dblosevn: can you help me in implementing that recover page? http://tutorialzine.com/2012/02/apple-like-login-form/
[05:11:58] <Cork> you could get ie6 for vista too
[05:12:07] <Cork> not for 7 though (i think)
[05:12:08] <systemfault> dblosevn: Companies needed IE6.
[05:12:13] <systemfault> (Some still do)
[05:13:06] <gotwig> needed
[05:13:07] <gotwig> lol
[05:13:21] <gotwig> People are are addepted to M$ are strange
[05:13:23] <systemfault> gotwig: Yeah... for their shit internal activex crap.
[05:13:26] <gotwig> *that
[05:13:31] <gotwig> *adicted
[05:13:46] <gotwig> unix/linux is open, free and there.
[05:13:56] <gotwig> but ok.. thats the wrong room for that
[05:14:07] <systemfault> Definitely.
[05:14:16] <gotwig> my page is http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/
[05:14:27] <gotwig> I want to implement http://tutorialzine.com/2012/02/apple-like-login-form/ but somehow I got a few problems.
[05:14:33] <gotwig> I want to integrate it into my slider
[05:15:04] <gotwig> the jquery part works I guess.. its just supposed to add a class to the div in the DOM...
[05:15:43] <gotwig> I just want that turning behaviour, via CSS transforms
[05:17:24] <dblosevn> systemfault: ya you could probally do something in active directory to stop the ie7 push
[05:17:52] <systemfault> IE6 will be supported until XP dies... that's the hard truth.
[05:18:05] <gotwig> systemfault: who cares
[05:18:06] <systemfault> As IE7 will be supported until Vista dies... and so on
[05:18:24] <dblosevn> vista should have died the day before it launched
[05:18:25] <systemfault> gotwig: I don't, some poor souls do.
[05:18:51] <gotwig> windows should have died the day it launched
[05:18:57] <gotwig> its a pain in da ass for open web standards
[05:19:30] <grafi> it isnt
[05:19:33] <dblosevn> now that i dont agree with, windows opened the door for what operating systems are today albeit they stole the tech from xerox but still they made it happen
[05:20:09] <systemfault> Ideas are meaningless... Execution is everything.
[05:20:40] <dblosevn> but apple stole the same tech from xerox lol
[05:20:42] <systemfault> That's why the damn iPad became a huge success even if the MS Tablet PC failed a few years before.
[05:21:28] <dblosevn> no the ipad became a success because apple knows how to market its not worth near what they sell it for, droid beats the ipad hands down on just about everything and always has for half the cost
[05:21:58] <systemfault> Who cares?
[05:22:11] <grafi> wouldnt say that dblosevn
[05:22:15] <grafi> maybe nowadays
[05:22:23] <grafi> but not always
[05:22:26] <dblosevn> its like when someone comes to me and says look what my ipad can do, this new ios6 is so awesome im like my droid did that 2 years aho lmao
[05:22:30] <systemfault> MS also knows how to market their things.
[05:22:45] <dblosevn> but they have a track record of failing lol
[05:22:47] <grafi> yeah look at the new ie ads xD
[05:23:09] <dblosevn> they have yet to do a product launch where the device didnt crash during the demo
[05:23:17] <systemfault> dblosevn: Having both an iphone 5 and a galaxy s3 with cyanogenmod on it... I prefer the galaxy for everything but the shit google store.
[05:23:28] <systemfault> dblosevn: The apple store is just so much better.
[05:23:34] <systemfault> Uncomparable.
[05:23:51] <grafi> really?
[05:23:57] <dblosevn> i prefer google play over the app store anyday, especially if you have multiple devices
[05:23:57] <systemfault> Yeah.... unfortunately.
[05:24:24] <grafi> i always had the impression even the hardcore apple people knew the store was shit
[05:24:33] <grafi> has there been a big update recently? ^^
[05:24:33] <alexises> systemfault: i prefer using google play on my desktop computer
[05:24:37] <alexises> is more usable
[05:24:39] <dblosevn> not to mention app store == money, play store == freefor the most part
[05:24:42] <systemfault> grafi: It's not a matter of look.. or usability.
[05:24:51] <grafi> what else is there?
[05:24:55] <alexises> i think that google play is too slow if you use the mobile network
[05:24:56] <systemfault> grafi: Quality...
[05:25:02] <grafi> of apps?
[05:25:42] <systemfault> grafi: If you want a game that is available on both the google store and the apple store.. the one on the google store is most of the time going to be a few versions behind the one on the apple store..
[05:26:11] <systemfault> And that's sad...
[05:26:38] <systemfault> Because I'm buying at least an app for the iphone a week... while I rarely do it on my s3
[05:26:47] <alexises> unfortunently, companys thinks that iphone is more profitable
[05:26:47] <grafi> interesting
[05:26:59] <grafi> but thats hardly the stores fault?!
[05:27:01] <alexises> and they push it !
[05:27:02] <systemfault> alexises: It seems to be for the moment... not sure.
[05:27:25] <systemfault> grafi: In the end, it's the user experience that matters... no matter if the store itself controls it or not.
[05:28:00] <grafi> true
[05:28:01] <alexises> systemfault: survays says that iphone users are more interest to pays hers applications then android's users
[05:28:17] <systemfault> alexises: Yeah.. I also read that somewhere...
[05:28:48] <tsotf> -.-" test
[05:28:50] <systemfault> 4 dollars a month is no big deal for me.
[05:29:21] <grafi> i find it more frustrating that i cant purchase apps without a credit card
[05:29:25] <grafi> seeing as i dont have one
[05:29:46] <sebastian> hi guys, should I expect that using $('#ds').find("something") will return a collection of positive matches that I can iterate using each() ?? or no?
[05:30:24] <systemfault> grafi: For the apple store, at least in canada, you can buy prepaid cards in pretty much any convenience store...
[05:30:35] <systemfault> grafi: No such thing for the google store where I live :(
[05:31:18] <grafi> here neither, which is really sucky
[05:32:09] <alexises> systemfault: in france you can also do that !
[05:32:41] <systemfault> Bon matin!
[05:32:51] <systemfault> Hmm.. aprÃ¨s-midi..
[05:36:07] <alexises> systemfault: it's 2:35 p.a ;)

[05:39:54] <sacho> sebastian, what problem are you facing?
[05:41:50] <karstenk1977_> hello, how to write a required attribute to a input?
[05:42:46] <sebastian> hi sacho, I'm customizing a SugarCRM menu and I can do something like this $('#moduleList').find('a');   but if I do something like this $('#moduleList').find('a').each(function(){this)}); I get an uninitialized page with no exceptions :/
[05:43:36] <sacho> well, that code specifically has a syntax error.
[05:44:09] <sacho> you can iterate over any jquery object, including the ones returned by find
[05:44:15] <systemfault> karstenk1977_: myInput.attr('required', 'required');?
[05:44:45] <mazzachre> How do you make the functionality where an argument is tested if it is a jQuery object or a list of DOM objects or a selector string?
[05:44:53] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[05:45:35] <systemfault> mazzachre: typeof and instanceof probably
[05:46:01] <sebastian> yeah that's why I've expected (fixing the parenthesis here but same result)
[05:46:28] <Ivru> Hello. Using jquery-latest, I'm unable to access the response headers from an ajax call (using getResponseHeader('myHeader')). Any idea why ?
[05:46:38] <Ivru> (sorry to repost but I'm really stuck...)
[05:46:51] <sebastian> the strange thing is that if I don't try to call each all is fine, and I also checked that jQuery isn't null at that point
[05:47:19] <bluescreenX> hello, for jquery mobile i want to create a redirect before the page change, i tried to bind "pagebeforeshow" but the triggered page is opened and then jumps to the redirect page
[05:47:47] <bluescreenX> i also tried to use e.preventDefault() but unfortunately no effect
[05:48:05] <sacho> sebastian, it's hard to know what's going on without a test case
[05:48:32] <sebastian> sure, I'll keep investigating
[05:48:46] <sebastian> thanks for your attention
[05:49:47] <bluescreenX> pagebeforechange seems not be triggered at all
[06:02:59] <paulvd> hello is there a end of media callback in jwplayer ?
[06:03:10] <paulvd> i want to hide the video after it has finished playing
[06:05:18] <Kasimir> paulvd they got an documentation for those things
[06:05:20] <Kasimir> http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28851/javascript-api-reference
[06:05:53] <goldstar> I have a function which does a sync ajax request and returns the resultset once complete. Problem is when I call it (var a = getAjaxData()), var a is undefined. This is probs due to the fact that the function has completed before the data could be returned. Are there any workarounds for this ? i.e. only return ONCE the ajax request is complete ? I am using $.ajax
[06:08:56] <paulvd> Kasimir: i know that already
[06:09:13] <grafi> goldstar: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[06:09:15] <didiergm> goldstar you must place your loginc inside the "success" of the ajax call, after the function call, this won't work
[06:10:18] <Kasimir> paulvd: well then you know you can use onTime and getDuration
[06:10:32] <_chrisftw_> hey guys
[06:10:36] <mazzachre> I am looking at using jQueryUI buttons, but I already have an icon gallery that we use. How to do that?
[06:11:28] <_chrisftw_> having some trouble with a simple line, how do I take out the items from this object. I know I have been on this a while, but being unfamiliar with jquery means I am having trouble making headway.
[06:12:12] <_chrisftw_> http://jsfiddle.net/fD6f7/9/ the problem is this line which outputs an item from the object onto the page:  $.each(data, function (i, item) {                                      $("<div/>").text("Book " + item).appendTo("#holder");
[06:12:27] <_chrisftw_> i am not sure how to pull out the params I need for it
[06:12:54] <gates> Hello, I am using jQuery Mobile for a web application and I am using AJAX page changes but removing the "old" page from the dom once the transition has finished loading. I have a few javascript functions that load on all pages function testFunction() { ... } but it seems once I remove the original page (the one that first loaded namely) the functions no
[06:12:54] <gates> longer exist. How do I load these functions each time a page change happens?
[06:15:43] <preyalone> Can someone help me with Flot? I want to set a min step of 1 without hardcoding the range of the axis.
[06:15:50] <bamarni> Hi have an ajax call set to "async: false", I'm displaying a loading spin, so "show()" before the ajax call, and on ajax success callback "hide()", this works perfectly on all browsers... expect IE?? I figured out this IE is not showing the loading spin at all! Because it's shown only when the ajax call finishes, even though I have this statement BEFORE, so then immediately hided, do you know why?
[06:17:52] <grafi> _chrisftw_: http://jsfiddle.net/fD6f7/9/
[06:18:49] <gates> After the page has transition i use page.remove() to delete it and with it goes the js functions
[06:19:37] <gates> If I wasn't removing the page it would keep the js functions that fired naturally but for whatever reason they are not like init on ajax changes
[06:20:38] <_chrisftw_> grafi - is that not the same code?
[06:20:54] <grafi> not if you look closely
[06:21:22] <grafi> oh, shame on me
[06:21:43] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/fD6f7/11/ _chrisftw_
[06:22:14] <_|Nix|_> gates: Do you have script tags inside the original page (like, insde <div data-role='page'>...</div>?
[06:22:18] <_|Nix|_> )
[06:23:00] <_chrisftw_> grafi, thank you so much

[06:23:09] <grafi> np
[06:23:32] <gates> _|Nix|_: on a page load i use page.remove(); to remove the page, i have some that are inside the page's div and some that (which are the ones i am testing) are in the header
[06:24:47] <bamarni> guys could you run this fiddle with IE? http://jsfiddle.net/PGgA6/ , even with the latest IE 10, I can't believe it! As you can see it works properly on other browsers.... what should I do please?
[06:25:41] <_|Nix|_> gates: So, lemme get this straight: You define some functions inside the header, and they disappear when you unload the page?
[06:26:28] <paulvd> how can i get to display special characters in javascript ?
[06:28:44] <gates> sorry my computer just crashed
[06:28:50] <gates> _|Nix|_: but here i am!
[06:28:53] <gates> i got a gist for you
[06:31:43] <gates> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/mprogano/5048279
[06:33:17] <gates> _|Nix|_: using page.remove() on a page that is not long present has fixed a great number of issue i was having where js wouldn't run or init correctly

[07:16:35] <Andres75> Hello everyone, I have done a jquery plugin for a matrix pager, but I have a small problem with it: when it starts up the first time it doesnt do the effect and can't really figure out why... can anyone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/XBTPy/
[07:23:16] <delboy1978uk> anyone else get horrendous backslashing and &quot; ing when using tinymce?
[07:25:53] <jedimind> delboy1978uk, yes probably
[07:25:59] <jedimind> those are escaped characters
[07:26:01] <jedimind> thats intentional
[07:26:14] <delboy1978uk> its horrible, i dont want it, can i turn it off?
[07:26:38] <jedimind> firstly, you're in the wrong channel
[07:26:46] <jedimind> secondly, you not wanting it doesn't equate to real life
[07:26:48] <jedimind> this isn't your 4th birthday party
[07:27:04] <delboy1978uk> and thirdly?
[07:27:37] <delboy1978uk> i would have thought a jquery plugin would have been on this channel
[07:28:12] <systemfault> Last time I used it... tinymce has NOTHING to do with jQuery.
[07:28:17] <systemfault> *had
[07:28:31] <delboy1978uk> yes it does you can download a jquery plugin
[07:28:54] <jedimind> lol
[07:29:27] <delboy1978uk> and no it's my 35th
[07:29:37] <delboy1978uk> but i still dont want it
[07:29:40] <jedimind> then i feel sorry for you
[07:29:46] <delboy1978uk> and ive learned to 'just ask' on irc
[07:29:53] <jedimind> just asking is one thing
[07:30:00] <jedimind> being blissfully ignorant of everything is completely separate
[07:30:02] <delboy1978uk> sorry you cant 'just answer', ill try someone more helpful
[07:30:32] <delboy1978uk> u didnt even know there was a jquery plugin b4 u started trolling me
[07:30:42] <jedimind> noone's trolling you
[07:30:51] <jedimind> we're just amusing ourselves with your abundance of retardation
[07:31:11] <jedimind> or i am anyway, i suppose i shouldn't speak for everyone
[07:31:20] <jedimind> this isn't a specific query plugin support channel by any stretch of the imagination
[07:31:40] <jedimind> also html characters SHOULD be escaped, otherwise they won't render properly on various encodings
[07:31:42] <jedimind> and operating systems
[07:32:05] <jedimind> that sentence made no sense
[07:34:15] <jedimind> i mean its akin to calling Microsoft to get support on Photoshop because you can install it on windows
[07:34:34] <_chrisftw_> Hi, sorry to interrupt the rant jedimind ;) I just wanted to say thanks to everyone in the channel who was of help today. I really appreciate it and I think you are all awesome. Godspeed.

[08:02:08] <j105rob> how can I test objects to see if one of the results from $(":input") is a textarea?

[08:07:41] <systemfault> ask

[08:08:18] <codacoder> any known probs with .trigger("custom", [obj1, obj2])
[08:08:26] <jeffci> hey, I have multiple <selects> on a page, I am trying to use the jQuery validation plugin to make sure the user selects something, I have added class="required" to the select but only the first select validates, the rest do not. How can i fix this?
[08:09:18] <djQuery> how can you initially hide a button in jquery mobile http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/1/edit
[08:09:43] <codacoder> in my on("custom") handler, obj2 has been forgotten
[08:10:20] <codacoder> in fact, the array doesn't exist, only arg other than the event itself is obj1
[08:11:37] <djQuery> jeffci, to make them required all you have to do is <select required><option value="">Select an option</option></select>
[08:12:04] <jeffci> djQuery: that is what I have but the first select on the page only works.
[08:12:04] <NoiseEee> djQuery: inline style it to not display?
[08:12:06] <djQuery> jeffci, as you know typicaly the first option is selecteed automagicaly if it has a value then the select has a value
[08:12:31] <djQuery> `demo@jeffci
[08:12:43] <jeffci> djQuery: if i have 3 on the page and I select press submit on the second option then the vlidation does not work
[08:13:02] <djQuery> NoiseEee, tried that it still displays
[08:13:13] <jeffci> what does `demo@jeffci mean?
[08:13:41] <djQuery> NoiseEee, jqm still wraps it in its stuff then displays that stuff
[08:13:47] <pachet> it means produce a demo of your code so we can see what you're talking about
[08:14:05] <djQuery> jeffci, and the bots not workin
[08:14:16] <jeffci> Ah :)
[08:14:16] * djQuery damn lazy bots
[08:14:24] <jeffci> ok, I will get a demo up, give me a min
[08:18:36] <Ungy> I have a really stupid question I am looking to turn my validation framework into a jQuery plugin but reading the documentation here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring It says I should not create claim more then one namespace but my framework is a series of objects so I am confused. How can I accomplish this or should I even bother?
[08:22:10] <jeffci> djQuery: http://demo.50clabs.com/ hit submit on the first item and hit submit on the third one (Gym Bag) the validation no longer works
[08:22:27] <andrew___> is it valid to do this alert("<div class=alert alert-error"+resp+"</div>");
[08:22:54] <Ungy> andrew___ well if you want it to display as text
[08:23:14] <Ungy> not to mention you woudl need to escape teh quotes
[08:23:16] <andrew___> Ungy:  i want to display the message in that div
[08:24:05] <Ungy> well if you want the value in the div you can do something else
[08:24:06] <djQuery> jeffci, on the 2nd one add the attribute required to the select
[08:24:31] <Ungy> and besides yoru not even closing your dive tag no ">"
[08:24:37] <djQuery> jeffci, or I gues on all of them
[08:24:42] <jeffci> djQuery: but I do.
[08:24:59] <andrew___> Ungy:  something like what
[08:25:47] <Ungy> andrew so what is it do you want teh value inside ofan existing div or are you trying to pop up an actual div
[08:25:54] <djQuery> jeffci, no you don't  u have <select name="attributes" id="select01" class="required">
[08:26:06] <djQuery> I am talking about <select name="attributes" id="select01" class="required" required>
[08:26:15] <jeffci> oh
[08:26:44] <andrew___> Ungy:  pop up an actual div
[08:26:46] <jeffci> that was it?
[08:26:50] <jeffci> that was easy
[08:26:59] <Ungy> andrew___ well then your not going to be using an alert
[08:27:07] <jeffci> thanks djQuery
[08:27:27] <andrew___> Ungy:  what can i do instead
[08:27:38] <djQuery> jeffci, the validation plugin is moving to using html5 properties instead of classes
[08:27:39] <Ungy> that is a very simple validation plugin hmmm I kinda like it but not as powerful as I need
[08:27:57] <jeffci> djQuery: much preferred, I didn't know that
[08:27:59] <andrew___> jquery validate
[08:28:47] <Ungy> andrew well you might want to try using jQuery ui  or use somethign like colorbox
[08:29:21] <djQuery> andrew___, you could use some sort of dialog plugin   $("<div class=alert alert-error"+resp+"</div>").dialog()
[08:29:50] <Ungy> but you would want to add the > otherwise it won't work
[08:30:03] <andrew___> will try that out
[08:30:27] <Ungy> unless of course your resp starts with a > then you know that is all you
[08:32:24] <Ungy> djQuery I was thinking of adding html5 validation support to my framework as well. but for those attributes I would need to look at jQuery('#whatever').attr('required') or the like correct?
[08:33:05] <djQuery> andrew___, oh and you may want $('<div class="alert-error'+resp+'"> </div>').dialog({modal: true, dialogClass: 'alert'});)
[08:33:40] <andrew___> djQuery:  this is if i use a jquery ui dialog?
[08:33:45] <Ungy> but if the html5 support is there i would want to remove it so after binding I would probably want to remove teh attribute correct?
[08:33:54] <djQuery> Ungy, or write selectors for them   $(':input[required]')
[08:33:56] <Ungy> andrew___ yes
[08:34:21] <djQuery> andrew___, yes
[08:34:27] <Ungy> djQUery nice then I would only need input select and textarea
[08:34:57] <djQuery> Ungy, and you wouldn't have to remove the attributes just set the form to no-validate
[08:35:32] <Ungy> hmm I guess that could work but my validation can span multiple forms
[08:36:02] <djQuery> Ungy, .each
[08:36:41] <Ungy> yeah but I would only want to do it if I was told to bind so I would have to find $(this).parent('form')
[08:37:10] <Ungy> but what if someone doesn't use the form tag?
[08:37:11] <djQuery> Ungy, they are passing the form or the fields to your plugin, should be the form no?
[08:37:51] <Ungy> djQueryactually mine is a stand alone object you can bind multiple validation groups and field groups and fields
[08:38:08] <Ungy> for different purposes and can be modified on teh fly
[08:38:43] <Ungy> the only reason I wrote it was because frankly every other framework out there I have seen isn't powerful enough
[08:38:46] <djQuery> Ungy, thats gonna get weird if I only pass a subset of form elements to the form then you turn off form validation on me
[08:38:58] <djQuery> so the others have no validation now
[08:39:15] <Ungy> that is what I am saying I shoudl remove the attribute on that field only
[08:39:42] <djQuery> Ungy, so you are going to remove the attribute type="email"  ????
[08:39:56] <Ungy> and my validation can be triggered by anythign so if you need a partial validation on onchange event of a drop down you can do it
[08:40:17] <Ungy> yeah I was thinking that I gotta think about it
[08:43:16] <Ungy> well hmm I really have a lot to think about
[08:43:29] <djQuery> Ungy, thought so
[08:43:38] <Ungy> I guess ai can do a fall back if nothign special is specified and handle it normally
[08:44:21] <Ungy> but overall it should actually work fine I just have to be careful
[08:44:40] <Ungy> it does depend on how the browsers implement things though
[08:44:56] <djQuery> Ungy, now help me hide my stuff lol http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/1/edit
[08:45:37] <djQuery> Ungy, don't think old ie will appreciate change the type of an input
[08:45:39] <Ungy> what are you trying to hide?
[08:45:59] <djQuery> the 2 extra buttons at the bott
[08:46:00] <Ungy> djQUery ;-) old IE isn't going to handle email regardless
[08:46:17] <djQuery> Ungy, hence needing a validation plugin
[08:46:28] <gates> I am using $.ajax({}) to make a call to my own server, I am using using www.* but I do not have it enforced, when I am on a mismatching www I get an error, "not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin", I tried setting the header() to allow * and that did not work, any ideas?
[08:46:48] <Ungy> djQuery you want to do it dynamically or just on load?
[08:46:57] <djQuery> gates, give the relative path not the full path
[08:47:17] <gates> djQuery: how do I ensure I am alway working off the / directory?
[08:47:31] <Wolfed> Anyone here sort of good with CSS? Trying to center a progress bar right in the middle of a div with changing size
[08:47:53] <Ungy> Wolfed that would require css and javascript my friend
[08:47:55] <gates> ie, if the URL is run in /category/topic/ and I need it to ajax a /get/somefile.php
[08:48:15] <Wolfed> Thats what I have. I've been struggling with it for a few hours now without much luck
[08:48:17] <djQuery> Wolfed, search for center div then put the progress bar in the div
[08:48:18] <systemfault> Wolfed: display: inline-block "could" help
[08:48:34] <Wolfed> http://jsfiddle.net/4mR3y/3/
[08:48:48] <Wolfed> I sort of tried to follow deadcentre's example without any luck
[08:49:40] <Ungy> Wolfed well first thing first parent ahs to be position:relative and the child has to be Position absolute
[08:50:01] <Ungy> just saying
[08:50:28] <djQuery> Ungy, gues I will just hack it and bind tot he pagebeforeshow for that page
[08:51:13] <Ungy> djQuery I am not sure what you want done
[08:51:27] <Ungy> do you want it to disapear on load or after a call
[08:52:37] <shoky> djQuery you can try data-role="none"
[08:52:46] <yousaf> Please help, i am losing my mind!
[08:53:18] <djQuery> shoky, then later I would have to apply button to them when I want to show them
[08:53:19] * systemfault helps yousaf with something unknown...
[08:53:19] <yousaf> http://tzd-themes.com/gebo_admin/index.php?uid=1&page=dashboard
[08:53:24] <yousaf> <div class="antiscroll-inner" style="width: 257px; height: 640px;">
[08:53:34] <yousaf> where is the width:257px coming from?
[08:53:45] <yousaf> its on the left side panel
[08:53:49] <Wolfed> Tried changing the position property around a few times, most I could do is get my progressbar off the page! :P
[08:54:49] <shoky> djQuery: i thought so too.. but.. http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/2/edit
[08:54:50] <Ungy> Wolfed well anytime you want to position against somethign else those two things are requirements
[08:57:22] * djQuery passess shoky a cookie, here take the whole box
[08:57:32] * shoky nomnomnom
[08:58:24] <Ungy> yousaf well your calculator is controlling the size sir
[09:01:51] * djQuery dang GS cookie boxes are getting big and content is getting smaller
[09:02:58] <yousaf> Ungy on another installation it is behaving slightly differently
[09:03:09] <yousaf> its adding width:240 for the same screen size etc
[09:03:58] <yousaf> and width:240 gives me ugly scrollbar
[09:04:56] <Ungy> yousaf it is calculating based on the size of largest object
[09:05:07] <Ungy> which in this case is yoru calculator
[09:05:16] <Ungy> pull all padding and margins
[09:05:34] <yousaf> Ungy this is really strange, it was fine and I haven't made any changes
[09:05:51] <yousaf> hmm
[09:05:52] <Ungy> maybe someone else made a change?
[09:05:54] <yousaf> let me see
[09:06:04] <yousaf> Ungy nope, but there is a paypal button
[09:06:05] <Ungy> or another object was added that is larger
[09:06:07] <yousaf> it might be that
[09:09:03] <yousaf> nope that is not it
[09:10:26] <Blackhawkso> What is the best jQuery command to use for removing the address bar in iOS??
[09:11:40] <djQuery> shoky, got the whole thing working now http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/5/edit
[09:11:48] <djQuery> click the save button
[09:12:05] <djQuery> shoky, thanks again
[09:12:51] <Ungy> djQUery I still see bla1
[09:13:46] <djQuery> Ungy, onload it is being displayed to show that it can be displayed
[09:14:22] <Ungy> ahh yeah nevermind I see
[09:22:06] <EugenA2> how can I get / define jqXHR object?
[09:24:06] <EugenA2> Using this https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[09:24:47] <derik> how to select a class on button press only from row that are button
[09:24:50] <EugenA2> cannot implement cancellation of upload
[09:24:51] <derik> in table
[09:24:52] <Wolfed> Ok managed to align it perfectly in the center, but the progressbar went flat lol
[09:25:34] <djQuery> derik, try phrasing that again
[09:26:05] <djQuery> derik, or create a jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net demo
[09:26:16] <leo-unglaub> hey, is it possible that an $(document).ready(function() is not working until there is mouse movement?
[09:27:19] <Ungy> leo-unglaub I suppose it is possible
[09:27:38] <djQuery> leo-unglaub, possible yes likely no
[09:27:38] <Ungy> derik that didn't really make sense
[09:27:50] <leo-unglaub> Ungy: that means it's not going to be triggered on an ipad?
[09:27:59] <derik> djQuery and Ungy i make a demo
[09:28:01] <Ungy> more than liekly
[09:28:21] <shoky> djQuery: oh .attr only worked on page load?
[09:28:35] <djQuery> shoky, yeah weird but workable
[09:29:00] <shoky> i guess it ran before jqmobile init ran
[09:29:08] <djQuery> shoky, probably
[09:29:26] <E_mE> is there no way to make $('#div').animate({height: '100%'}, 1000); actually animate, or will it just snap straight to 100% always?
[09:29:39] <leo-unglaub> so is there a way to make sure it's going to be triggered?
[09:29:40] <E_mE> i know you can with 200px, but that kind of defeats the point
[09:29:41] <djQuery> shoky, so your milage may vary if you page is bigger or smaller or if jqm just isn't likeing you today
[09:30:17] <shoky> djQuery: yeah anyway i didn't like the .attr solution either
[09:30:25] <shoky> "solution"
[09:30:26] <djQuery> leo-unglaub, this is one of those instances that we don't want to tell you that we don't believe you , but we don't believe you
[09:30:33] <Ungy> djQuery or you could use a chain loader
[09:31:12] <leo-unglaub> djQuery: what?
[09:31:28] <djQuery> Ungy, I didn't need that mine need to always be hidden initialy. they only get displayed depending on what other page sends you to that one
[09:31:34] <derik> when i press button to select input class1, class2, class3 from row that are button http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/
[09:31:51] <Ungy> leo-unglaub the fact that a mouse-movement is holding up jQuery from running is highly unlikely
[09:31:58] <djQuery> $(document).ready should always run eventualy regardless of what you do with your mouse
[09:32:15] <leo-unglaub> Ungy: no
[09:32:27] <leo-unglaub> you got me wrong, it's not triggered until i move my mouse
[09:32:37] <leo-unglaub> not blocking because it move it
[09:32:38] <Ungy> derik you want teh classes of the inputs in teh same row as teh button press?
[09:32:57] <derik> yes
[09:33:07] <derik> i cant make ids for this
[09:33:08] <derik> only class
[09:34:00] <djQuery> derik, the tr should have an id. or at least some attribute that yo can pull to get the id of the corresponding database table
[09:34:30] <derik> without id can`t be made?
[09:34:31] <djQuery> derik, each of the inputs should have a name just like you were doing a single form
[09:35:16] <djQuery> derik, is this something to do with editing data in some table
[09:38:04] <EugenA2> anybody has some exp with query uploader github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload ?
[09:40:07] <ries> hello! I noticed that the .load function adds a random number to the url, can I prevent that?
[09:40:48] <systemfault> Why would you want to avoid that?
[09:40:59] <systemfault> Do you get why it's there?
[09:43:00] <ries> systemfault: I found it in ajaxSetup, this wasn't my scriptsâ€¦ the reason is that I do want ajax requests to be cached
[09:43:02] <whatever_42> hey guys. can anyone tell me why this query code does not work the way i want it to be? http://jsfiddle.net/rEuH9/
[09:43:55] <bnb_dev> I have nested ul li that is being used as menu, the parent ul li has Home,About Us, Courses etc links, I want when user click on courses link then parent ul li slides left and its child ul li (contains English, Management etc) show it's place
[09:44:00] <bnb_dev> How I do that?
[09:44:12] <whatever_42> so why query runs the second .html command immediately
[09:44:52] <bnb_dev> I pasted the code here http://jsfiddle.net/4qvXP/
[09:45:40] <shoky> whatever_42: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rEuH9/1/
[09:46:05] <whatever_42> ok i'll try that thank you
[09:46:10] <bnb_dev> the example of the menu can be seen here https://www.facebook.com/help/
[09:46:39] <bnb_dev> can some one let me know How I build menu like that?
[09:48:01] <djQuery> derik, this should have done it don't know why its not
[09:48:03] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/4/
[09:48:14] <djQuery> derik, only the first row should work
[09:48:21] <derik> djQuery that i whant to do http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/3/ when i chechk
[09:48:46] <shoky> .serialize(':input') ?
[09:52:33] <djQuery> derik, something like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/5/
[09:52:48] <djQuery> shoky, .serialize itself didn't work
[09:53:17] <shoky> djQuery:  .find(':input').serialize()
[09:53:47] <derik> yes djQuery samething like this
[09:53:48] <shoky> and them inputs better have names ;P
[09:53:50] <derik> thanks for help
[09:54:21] <djQuery> derik, little edit http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/6/
[09:55:20] <derik> :D thanks a lot
[10:00:42] <derik> djQuery is a little bug, when i select 2 ore more checkbox and i whant to deselect one of theme dosen`t work
[10:02:34] <derik> djQuery sorry this was in 5 version , on 6 version is ok
[10:08:03] <pardis> I'm new to jquery and using jquery 1.9.  My question is which one is the prefered or correct one to use -- .attr( ) or .prop( )
[10:08:16] <systemfault> .prop most of the time.
[10:08:42] <pardis> when should you use .attr( ) ?
[10:08:55] <pardis> as opposed to .prop
[10:09:44] <systemfault> pardis: when you actually need to get the value of an attribute (Attributes are what is parsed from the original HTML)
[10:09:44] <Ungy> derik would it be faster to do what you did with eh td's or just straight do it like so http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/8/
[10:10:17] <systemfault> pardis: When you use prop, you interact with the DOM Node properties/members variables
[10:10:56] <plipp> Do any of you people use templating such as genshi?
[10:11:02] <pardis> Okay, got it. Thank you
[10:11:26] <derik> thanks for advice Ungy
[10:11:36] <derik> you say that your version is faser
[10:11:37] <derik> faster
[10:11:43] <Ungy> derik I was asking you
[10:12:26] <Ungy> I have never tried to do anything like you did before I was trying to determine if there was a benefit to it
[10:12:32] <derik> oh, i don`t know, im nooby on jquery
[10:13:26] <Ungy> I am not very good at jQuery but I am pretty damn good with straight JavaScript so I am trying to do things the jQuery way
[10:14:59] <Ungy> I am trying to figure out if your way is actually faster if so I might start trying to do it that way
[10:16:03] <djQuery> Ungy, derik, there shouldn't be any difference between doing .closest('td') vs .parent  but closest('td') allows greater flexibility incase he puts the checkbox inside some kind of wrapper. it will keep searching up until it finds the td where as parent will just go up 1 level
[10:16:13] <djQuery> well noticable speed difference
[10:16:46] <Ungy> right but you coudlmake it parent('td')
[10:17:29] <djQuery> Ungy, give it a try
[10:17:57] <djQuery> Ungy, but when you try wrap the checkbox in a <span> or something
[10:18:09] <DukeDrake> hi
[10:19:27] <DukeDrake> hi .... I'm trying to figure out communication between parentframe and iframe ...
[10:19:28] <djQuery> Ungy, I am not sure if parent('td') will go up just 1 level or go all the way to the td in that case,  either way there would not be a niticable speed differnce
[10:19:52] <djQuery> DukeDrake, nested frames?
[10:19:56] <DukeDrake> from the subframe I can't access window.parent.location properties?
[10:20:14] <DukeDrake> i.e. I'd need the path part
[10:20:38] <Ungy> djQuery http://jsfiddle.net/xbfs7/9/ ?
[10:20:48] <djQuery> DukeDrake, you need to access window.parent then access its window.parent.location
[10:21:01] <DukeDrake> ?
[10:21:39] <djQuery> Ungy, for some reason jsfiddle just to a ..... on me and I cnt see the output did it work?
[10:21:55] <Ungy> yeah just have to switch to parents
[10:22:11] <djQuery> sorry jsbin just took a ....
[10:22:13] <DukeDrake> djQuery: how can I do that?
[10:22:23] <djQuery> DukeDrake, dunno I hate frames
[10:22:28] <DukeDrake> hehe
[10:22:33] <DukeDrake> can't blame you for that ;)
[10:23:43] <Ungy> Duke Drake are the frames on different domains?
[10:23:46] <djQuery> jqm needs more icons
[10:24:20] <DukeDrake> Ungy: yes
[10:25:13] <Ungy> DukeDrake do you need to support older browsers?
[10:27:38] <DukeDrake> Ungy: errrr ... depends XD
[10:28:12] <Ungy> well browser security technically will not allow you to communicate between frames on seperate domains
[10:28:25] <Ungy> However if you have access to both frames you can do a postmessage
[10:29:06] <DukeDrake> heh ...
[10:29:24] <DukeDrake> I already pondererd, if I could message the child frame from the parent frame ... ?
[10:29:32] <Ungy> http://ejohn.org/blog/postmessage-api-changes/
[10:29:52] <Ungy> if you do not have access between the two your out of luck sir
[10:30:45] <DukeDrake> well ... I do ... but sending a post message is not, what I want to do =)
[10:32:36] <Ungy> hmm I dunno sir you can pass a message telling the child the parents location
[10:56:51] <jeredepp_> Hello everyone, i got a bit of a problem here, anybody got an idea how to achieve what i want here http://pastebin.com/hm59aymR
[11:00:13] <k_89> backbone is too explicit
[11:00:18] <k_89> angular is too hard :P
[11:01:25] <kiki67100> Hello
[11:01:52] <kiki67100> I would to know if possible to clone a form, delete some input and submit cloned form ?
[11:02:16] <jeredepp_> what do you mean by clone a form?
[11:02:16] <Ungy> kiki67100 why would it not be?
[11:02:19] <tongcx> hi guys, what does $[0] means?
[11:03:40] <pachet> tongcx: nothing, at least in the context of this channel
[11:04:12] <kiki67100> Ungy: I do that but anything do
[11:04:13] <kiki67100> http://pastebin.com/wgK50ZVz
[11:04:22] <tongcx> pachet: in ".appendTo('body')[0].submit()" ?
[11:04:42] <tongcx> pachet: i guess it means the form i just appended, but why?
[11:05:02] <Ungy> kiki67100  ahh you mean use jQuery clone directly
[11:05:06] <pachet> oh, that's just getting the first element in that jq object
[11:05:10] <chilversc> tongcx: at a guess you have something like; $('<form></form>') right?
[11:05:18] <tongcx> chilversc: right
[11:05:20] <kiki67100> Ungy: Yes
[11:05:30] <pachet> it's just so that you call the .submit() method directly on that dom element
[11:05:35] <pachet> rather than on the jq object holding it
[11:05:44] <chilversc> tongcx: so that gives you a jquery object, if you look at the jquery object you'll see it is based upon an array
[11:05:52] <kiki67100> Ungy: Is not possible to work with cloned object ? I must append to inside body ?
[11:06:08] <pachet> im not sure whether calling $('<form />').submit() would invoke the .submit() method of that dom element
[11:06:14] <kiki67100> Ungy: Excuse my english, i'm french
[11:06:25] <chilversc> tongcx: so that's getting the element at index 0 in the array, ie, the first DOM node from the jquery object
[11:06:45] <tongcx> chilversc: so jquery object holds an array of DOM nodes?
[11:07:01] <chilversc> tongcx: right, that matched the selector, or in this case, that was created from the html
[11:07:16] <chilversc> tongcx: incidently, you can also use the method, .get(0) to do the same thing
[11:07:31] <Ungy> kiki67100 you probably just want to do an each on all input select and text area tags correct?
[11:08:11] <tongcx> chilversc: thanks
[11:08:16] <chilversc> tongcx: oh sorry, .eq(0) not .get
[11:08:25] <shoky> .get was right
[11:09:08] <chilversc> ah, no right the first time, looking at the wrong bit of the documentation
[11:09:12] <chilversc> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:09:18] <kiki67100> Ungy: I would like to create form with method="get" from a form who exist in html who has method="post" and delete some input who has no value
[11:09:39] <Ziggy`> There's a plugin I'm trying out, it's using $.browser, and as of version 1.9 $.browser is deprecated and does not function. What do you suggest as an alternative?
[11:09:40] <micz123> hi all, newbie question here. Suppose i have html like http://pastebin.com/8C8QLGWT  I plan to send data through jquery.ajax(), any idea how to append or add data from data-code in the div id'abc' to the data ready to send in jquery ajax?
[11:09:41] <chilversc> I was expecting to find that method under traversing, I should just give up on bothering with the categories, search is far simpler
[11:10:27] <Ungy> kiki67100 well you would need to create a new form
[11:11:20] <shoky> Ziggy`: either get the plugin author to make a new jquery 1.9 compatible version, do it yourself, or use $.migrate plugin
[11:12:08] <Ziggy`> shoky: Well, it's ony one single line which checks if $.browser.msie ..
[11:12:27] <shoky> Ziggy`: then it might be simple to fix it yourself
[11:13:26] <shoky> feature-detect instead of browser-detect is the general theme
[11:14:21] <Ziggy`> shoky: Yeah,
[11:14:32] <Ziggy`> shoky: I'm gonna look at this a bit, I'm just looking for suggestions.
[11:15:01] <kiki67100> Ungy: It's possible to recreate new url from serialize ?
[11:18:24] <tongcx> how does jquery store data associated with a DOM node?
[11:19:36] <Ungy> kik67100 http://pastebin.com/E05FezAT
[11:19:42] <say2joe> the data attribute and the legacy $.cache property
[11:20:22] <Ungy> kiki67100 note that code requires jQuery to run it is older code
[11:21:27] <tongcx> say2joe: so in the memory, or in the dom in style?
[11:21:59] <Ungy> kiki67100 that shoudl do what you need you just need to fill out the path and the form name in teh final call
[11:22:13] <say2joe> tongcx: $.cache is in memory. the data attribute are in the DOM (memory as well). depends on what you're doing.
[11:23:39] <kiki67100> Ungy: I see, serialize get the action and location.href on submit ?
[11:24:17] <Ungy> kiki67100 sorry I had a typo and forgot to remove yoru empty values http://pastebin.com/sQZDpJJT
[11:24:19] <tongcx> say2joe: how could i see the data property?
[11:24:57] <say2joe> var $myDOMnode = $("selector"); $myDOMnode.data("label","value");
[11:25:19] <say2joe> and thenâ€¦ $myDOMnode.data("label") gets the value.
[11:25:25] <Ungy> kiki67100 if your tryign to not submit the page you can create an iframe and submit that but you would have to change teh appention to the iFrame
[11:26:16] <say2joe> $.cache is used by jQuery internallyâ€¦ but, you can open a Console and just type $.cache to see the objects
[11:26:33] <say2joe> it stores relevant information such as event handlers on particular DOM nodes.
[11:26:35] <tongcx> say2joe: yes, but how does jquery know where to find data, does it attach a property to this DOM by say '<p data="dsfsdf">...'
[11:27:09] <say2joe> for event handlers, it uses the $.cache property. or data("events") â€¦ but, that's been deprecated with the latest release.
[11:28:02] <Ungy> kiki67100 but if you want to submit the current page you can just do createAndSubmitDynamicForm(getAllFormInputsToObject(your Form), '/','GET'); and ti will submit back to itself
[11:28:18] <kiki67100> Ungy: Thanks for you code
[11:28:20] <kiki67100> !
[11:28:31] <kiki67100> I just do $('form').attr('method','get')
[11:28:46] <kiki67100> I have to go, I saved your code thanks for your help
[11:28:48] <kiki67100> :)
[11:29:09] <Ungy> createAndSubmitDynamicForm(getAllFormInputsToObject($'form'), '/','GET');  should work
[11:29:41] <Ungy> I mean createAndSubmitDynamicForm(getAllFormInputsToObject(($('form')), '/','GET'); if you only have one form on teh page
[11:30:15] <Ungy> Oh well hope he figures it out
[11:31:04] <Ungy> he/she whatever
[11:41:36] <yedi> $('.disable-on-submit').parents('form:first').submit(function {})
[11:41:47] <yedi> $(this) will refer to that first form right?
[11:42:15] <yedi> is there a way i'd be able to access the .disable-on-submit button?
[11:42:17] <Ungy> yedi this in what context
[11:42:28] <yedi> inside the function of submit
[11:42:33] <yedi> i pass to submit*
[11:43:08] <Ungy> yedi if you in case it and create a seperate variable for this you can
[11:43:17] <NoiseEee> yedi: presumably you can get it by selecting it again?
[11:43:27] <yedi> NoiseEee: right but that feels inelegant
[11:43:30] <NoiseEee> yedi: but no, its never going to be "this"
[11:44:09] <NoiseEee> yedi: meh... var btn = $('.disable-on-submit');  btn.parents('form:first').submit(function () { //can still use btn here })
[11:44:33] <Brodingo> awk selector
[11:44:54] <Ungy> NoiseEee yup I ahve had to do that a few times
[11:45:21] <yedi> NoiseEee: that would disable all the disable-on-submit buttons won't it?
[11:45:29] <yedi> and not just the one whose form was submitted
[11:46:06] <Ungy> yedi you can crawl down
[11:46:11] <NoiseEee> yedi: i haven't disabled anything, ive just cached the reference
[11:46:36] <friedbyte> how would I .addClass() to respective list items from separate lists?
[11:46:47] <iksik> hello
[11:46:55] <yedi> NoiseEee: sorry i'm projecting my current use case on to you. But i meant wouldn't btn store the references to all of things matched by .disable-on-submit
[11:47:13] <Ungy> yedi yup
[11:47:16] <friedbyte> say I clicked on something from the 3rd list item, how would I get that to do something to the 3rd list item on a different list?
[11:47:18] <yedi> and not just to the one button whose parent form submitted it
[11:47:22] <NoiseEee> yedi: if anything, maybe event delegation will make things clearer.  $('someParentElement').on('submit','form',function() { //figure out everything here that you care about, where everything happened in the $(ev.target))
[11:47:35] <iksik> is there any plugin, which can help with implementation of vim-like keyboard handling? some keyboard sequence which is registered, and some event is fired after sequence is complete
[11:47:47] <NoiseEee> yedi: in that example ^^  $(ev.target) will always refer to the submitted form, you can targe the button easier
[11:47:49] <Ungy> friedbyte if they mach you can use a counter and iterate through
[11:47:54] <_bart> I'm doing $(".screenshotpreview").attr("data-href", $(this).attr("href"));, but I don't see the attribute added/changed, why?
[11:48:14] <yedi> NoiseEee: yea, i don't think i can get around reselecting the element
[11:48:21] <yedi> NoiseEee: thanks for the help
[11:48:23] <hye> does Jquery 1.9.1 not work for jquery mobile?
[11:48:24] <_bart> ah nvm, figured it out
[11:48:32] <NoiseEee> yedi: its a funny selector in the first place.
[11:48:33] <friedbyte> Ungy: they do match
[11:48:45] <NoiseEee> yedi: there's a better way to capture the submitted form without getting to it by the button first.
[11:49:36] <yedi> well what i want to do is disable the buttons whose class is disable-on-submit when their forms are submit. How could i do that without going through the button?
[11:49:55] <Ungy> yedi $(form).submit(function() {  });
[11:49:55] <NoiseEee> yedi: by capturing the form and then targeting the buttons within that form!
[11:50:14] <maxmoore14> having trouble with a custom event handler. can someone take a look at this with me? http://jsbin.com/ixowod/2/edit
[11:51:00] <DrJones_> Hi all, anyone is aware of issues usinj $.ajax calls in iOS (Apple) captive portal screen? My code worrks great when accessed via Safari on iOS but when it's in captive portal mode I get a 101...
[11:51:10] <NoiseEee> yedi:  $('someParentElement').on('submit','form',function(ev) {  var form = $(ev.target);  var btn = form.find('button.disable-on-submit').prop('disabled',true); })
[11:52:38] <yedi> NoiseEee: so i'd have to wrap every form with someParentElement? or would it make sense to use document
[11:52:40] <Ungy> Noisee woudl this work $('form').submit(function() { $(this)children('.disable-on-submit').prop('disabled',true) });
[11:53:00] <chilversc> DrJones_: you shouldn't see a http 101, that's supposed to be handled by the browser
[11:53:02] <NoiseEee> Ungy's would work well too  @ yedi
[11:53:08] <yedi> i see
[11:53:09] <yedi> thanks
[11:53:24] <NoiseEee> yedi: ungy;s case *wouldn't* work if forms were added dynamically though
[11:53:32] <Ungy> I am just speculating but I think it makes sense not great with jQuery
[11:53:45] <NoiseEee> Ungy: no thats a fine selector :)
[11:53:53] <maxmoore14> everything working as expected, but the custom event handler never gets called - http://jsbin.com/ixowod/2/edit
[11:54:01] <DrJones_> chilversc : Well, I added some debug alerts, and my ajax calls returns to the error with thrownError 101.
[11:54:14] <chilversc> DrJones_: ah, not http status code 101
[11:54:26] <yedi> thanks NoiseEee & Ungy
[11:54:32] <NoiseEee> np yedi good luck
[11:54:51] <DrJones_> chilversc: sorry yes not http 101, the NETWORK_ERROR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101
[11:55:09] <chilversc> DrJones_: hmm, apparently thats a NETWORK_ERROR and can be caused by trying to do a cross-origin request
[11:55:17] <Ungy> NoiseEee could I just modify it to use on to catch dynamic elements
[11:55:45] <chilversc> DrJones_: which begs the question, when using a captive portal in ios, what does ios think the origin url is
[11:55:48] <DrJones_> chilversc: Yeah but the it's not. I think the captive portal still thinks it's in apple.com land and not my domain.
[11:55:54] <NoiseEee> Ungy: yes, in the case where forms were getting added directly, event delegation via .on() is the way to go
[11:56:11] <Ungy> nice I use ti for my validation framework
[11:56:19] <Ungy> but never tried that one
[11:57:00] <DrJones_> chilversc: And I am using document.domain when calling my ajax URL and document.domain does equal my domain
[11:57:27] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to trigger a custom event?
[11:57:27] <DrJones_> chilversc: Any way to know what the captibe portal "browser" think it is in?
[11:58:01] <djQuery> dang the alignment is all screwy. http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/8/edit     when the screen is narrow it looks fine but when wide the labels don't line up
[11:59:20] <Ungy> djQuery and I suppose dynaimically setting the width of your label is out of the question?
[12:00:02] <djQuery> Ungy, don't think it has anything to do with that I tried setting them all to the same text
[12:01:53] <maxmoore14> I think I am attaching to the event incorrectly - something to do with widget namespacing of events
[12:02:23] <Ungy> djQuery guess yoru right that is wierd
[12:02:33] <chilversc> DrJones_: dunno, iirc there's a property on the document that will tell you its origin
[12:02:45] <maxmoore14> does anyone know the format generated? widget name is mcmMobile.tabs, event name is changeTab
[12:03:08] <chilversc> DrJones_: oh, how do you do the captive page, do you redirect to a different url, or do you just display it at the url the user requested?
[12:03:12] <maxmoore14> would it be tabschangeTab? mcmMobile-tabschangeTab?
[12:03:39] <diablo> hey guys, i'm making an ajax request to a node.js process that doesn't send a response deliberately and expect to timeout after 120sec
[12:04:01] <DrJones_> chilversc: the apache server servs a 404 document which does a javascript redirect to the proper domain.
[12:04:01] <maxmoore14> better yet, is there a way to use the chrome debugger or firebug to see what event is thrown?
[12:04:22] <Ungy> diablo and?
[12:04:31] <DrJones_> chilversc: Unfortunatly doing a direct rewrite in apache is not possible as it's a patented method...
[12:04:32] <jarray52> When I include jquery-1.7.2.js in a php .tpl file, I see the following error in the web browser console. TypeError: a.style is undefined. The error keeps repeating itself thousands of times. What could be causing this issue?
[12:04:40] <chilversc> DrJones_: huh?
[12:04:51] <chilversc> DrJones_: how so? its just a http status code
[12:05:42] <diablo> but somehow after the timeout is reached in the node process the socket is closed but gets the same request again and waits to timeout for another 120s
[12:06:08] <diablo> Ungy, its as if jquery is retrying'
[12:06:17] <DrJones_> chilversc: I can't give out specifics, but the method (or aparentus as they say in patent documents) to redirect a a user to a captive portal page is patented... Not the status code per say, but the use of that method...
[12:06:26] <diablo> Ungy, i'm doing a $.post() just so you know
[12:06:41] <puneet_> I have a site. Here is a link to the site: http://demo.it-consultis.com/villebois/....username:itc     pass:2013
[12:06:58] <puneet_> I am facing a problem with my javascript
[12:07:03] <chilversc> DrJones_: oh, so the concept of hijacking any request and redirecting to a different page for the purpose of signing in to network
[12:07:21] <chilversc> DrJones_: I was gunna say, patenting 303 See Other seemed a bit far fetched :)
[12:07:23] <puneet_> The menu items are not scrolling on desired pages
[12:07:24] <DrJones_> chilversc: Exact... FYI: http://wifinetnews.com/archives/2004/01/new_license_fee_may_face_operators.html
[12:07:39] <puneet_> Here is the javascript: http://pastebin.com/Vy5zmELF
[12:08:17] <chilversc> DrJones_: this javascript/ajax, is it part of the 404 page?
[12:08:31] <puneet_> Can Anybody help me in figuring out the problem?
[12:09:22] <DrJones_> chilversc: No because the first page the person hits is not in the domain we do the ajax, so we a window.location in that 404 page which bring the user to the proper domain.
[12:09:59] <DrJones_> chilversc: again this code and method works A1 when the iOS captive portal is disabled.
[12:10:05] <rickardo> If I do $('#id')[0].firstChild    -- how can I convert it back into a jquery object?
[12:10:11] <Ungy> diablo wierd do you catch if ther eis an error?
[12:10:56] <puneet_> Site link is http://demo.it-consultis.com/villebois/
[12:11:18] <djQuery> DrJones_, well at least this company doesn't look like a patent troll  looks like they actualy use it themselves
[12:11:49] <chilversc> DrJones_: is document.baseURI showing the correct url after the location has changed?
[12:11:54] <DrJones_> djQuery: Yes they use it... Just happens that the product I am working on is let's say in the same business ;-)
[12:12:06] <diablo> Ungy, there are no errors, I'm simply making the request timeout in the node process but now staring to suspect if its related to node.js, just thought I'd ping here to see if you have any thoughts
[12:12:18] <DrJones_> chilversc: let me check.
[12:12:52] <chilversc> or document.documentURI
[12:12:56] <jarray52> When I include jquery-1.7.2.js in a php .tpl file, I see the following error in the web browser console. TypeError: a.style is undefined. The error keeps repeating itself thousands of times. What could be causing this issue?
[12:12:58] <diablo> Ungy, it just got weirder, this "retry" thing happens only after every successful 200 okay calls
[12:13:16] <chilversc> or apparently document.URL
[12:13:31] <puneet_> Any help please?
[12:13:43] <diablo> Ungy, otherwise it simply waits for 120secs and fails but after every 200 OK calls, it waits 240secs
[12:14:10] <DrJones_> chilversc: document.referrer = http://apple.som/library/test/success.html
[12:14:27] <DrJones_> chilversc: document.baseURI = my domain
[12:14:41] <chilversc> referrer shouldn't matter, that's just where it came from, and that sounds like it should work
[12:15:20] <Ungy> diablo why is ti sending 200?
[12:15:25] <jarray52> puneet_: The site is password protected.
[12:15:44] <puneet_> jarray52: itc/2013
[12:15:56] <chilversc> DrJones_: hmm, wonder what the document.domain property says
[12:16:14] <diablo> Ungy, sorry if I wasn't clear..  lets say we have two calls /sleep and /hi and /hi is 200 OK and /sleep simply doesn't return anything and timesout
[12:16:37] <DrJones_> chilversc: document.domain = my domain
[12:16:47] <diablo> Ungy, so when you call /hi first and then call /sleep it waits for 4 mins and if you call /sleep again it only waits for 120secs or 2 mins which is expected
[12:16:52] <chilversc> and that matches the domain used in the ajax request?
[12:16:56] <puneet_> jarray52: JS is applied on menu items.... but the menu items are not scrolling to the deried anchors
[12:17:01] <DrJones_> chilversc: yes
[12:17:01] <diablo> Ungy, that 4 mins thing is the strange part I'm trying to figure
[12:17:05] <Ungy> diablo ok that is wierd
[12:17:13] <pierpark> Hey everyone
[12:17:14] <chilversc> this makes me think that perhaps it isn't a CORS problem then, trouble is, that's more difficult to solve
[12:17:28] <puneet_> jarray52 Here is the java script : http://pastebin.com/Vy5zmELF
[12:17:29] <DrJones_> chilversc: document.documentURI = full path in my domain of the page being rendered
[12:17:44] <chilversc> DrJones_: I'm thinking 1 of 2 things now, browser bug, or there's something else happening that is interfering with the ajax request
[12:17:47] <DrJones_> chilversc: CORS ?
[12:17:52] <diablo> Ungy, yeah, I just wrote a little script for easy debug.. http://pastebin.com/JjPnuAwM can you try it with chrome dev console to confirm ?
[12:17:56] <chilversc> DrJones_: cross-origin resource sharing
[12:18:07] <DrJones_> chilversc: oh ok.
[12:18:16] <chilversc> DrJones_: I'd try and use something like Fiddler2 to wireshark and check what is actually going over the network
[12:18:25] <chilversc> s/to/or/
[12:18:35] <jarray52> puneet_:
[12:18:41] <DrJones_> chilversc: The captive portal in iOs is not the full safari that I know.
[12:18:44] <maxmoore14> still struggling here - http://jsbin.com/ixowod/4/edit - the handler never gets called
[12:18:50] <jarray52> puneet_: Sorry. What's the problem?
[12:18:51] <puneet_> jarray52 yes buddy
[12:19:02] <diablo> Ungy, simply run the node.js thing it doesn't have any dependency then access localhost:2020  then from the output simply copy and past the js calls in the dev console to replicate my problem
[12:19:06] <chilversc> DrJones_: right, but its likely still using NSWebView, which is pretty much safari
[12:19:19] <DrJones_> chilversc: accorging to my apache logs the ajax request never makes it to apache
[12:19:49] <puneet_> jarray52 try to click on footer menu items....the menu items are not scrolling to the desired anchors
[12:19:58] <chilversc> DrJones_: yeah, makes me wonder if its either trying to resolve something incorrectly, and failing, or maybe even something silly like the ajax triggers another check to success.html
[12:20:16] <chilversc> DrJones_: only way to tell is to see what is being sent over the network
[12:20:41] <DrJones_> chilversc: I'll setup wireshark and I'll know fast enough
[12:20:56] <puneet_> jarray52: click on company history the page scrolls to company history page but when you click on contact the page is not scrolling to contact page
[12:21:09] <DrJones_> chilversc: thanks  for the hints
[12:21:22] <chilversc> DrJones_: but if it works when captive portal is turned off inside safari, then it rules out silly errors like a mis-spelt url as well
[12:21:35] <chilversc> and if the domain property is correct, that rules out CORS
[12:21:54] <puneet_> jarray52: and when you click on company history and then on home.....after theat click on contact the scroller scrolls to conbtact page
[12:21:54] <Ungy> diablo I have no idea how to even do that
[12:22:21] <puneet_> jarray52: means if you want to go to correct page you first have to go to home page
[12:22:22] <DrJones_> chilversc: Yes that's what I think also. I know my code is ok as I tested in IT7,8,9 FF, Chrome, Safari and Firefox in Windoze, Linux, OSX, Android and iOS ;-)
[12:22:33] <puneet_> jarray52 : I need to correct this
[12:23:17] <jarray52> puneet_: Those series of actions worked for me. However, I did have problems with the 100% Made in France link.
[12:23:23] <chilversc> DrJones_: you might just have to have the page degrade and work without ajax if a network error happens, at least that way its still usable
[12:23:39] <jarray52> puneet_: I understand the problem. Let me look at the code.
[12:23:42] <diablo> Ungy, sorry, do you have chrome and node.js ?
[12:24:14] <puneet_> jarray52: ya.... Should I send you the link again to the code?
[12:24:27] <jarray52> puneet_: I have it.
[12:24:28] <Ungy> diablo no I do not use node.js
[12:24:36] <puneet_> jarray52: ok thanks
[12:24:44] <DrJones_> chilversc: yeah that will be tough as we need to get some data on the user session from internel database using the user's Ip address.
[12:30:37] <jarray52> puneet_: I don't see what's wrong at the moment. It's hard to debug a piece of code that size without being able to put debugging statements in the code. I would recommend using alert statements or log statements to isolate the location of the error.
[12:31:37] <puneet_> jarray52: I am very weak in this. Can you guide me ?
[12:32:21] <pierpark> .. Technical difficulties today
[12:32:42] <jarray52> puneet_: use alert(<variable_name>);
[12:32:59] <jarray52> puneet_: Then, try to find the location of the error.
[12:33:49] <green-> trying to use slideup and slideDown() to hide/show table rows â€¦ but duration seems to be getting ignored. rows are hiding/showing, but with no effect, just instantlyâ€¦ any thoughts?
[12:34:48] <xmaddness> Is there a way to check a Jjson to see if it is valid in jquery?
[12:34:49] <xmaddness> or js
[12:35:33] <xmaddness> or is the regex sword the only way?
[12:36:01] <xmaddness> erm nm, let me try with parseJson
[12:36:58] <puneet_> jarray52: the scroller is not working on even anchors
[12:39:21] <andrew9184> can anyone recommend a good sortable header plugin ? :D
[12:40:04] <djQuery> andrew9184, for a table?
[12:41:06] <andrew9184> yeah
[12:41:56] <Che-Anarc> in jQM how to turn off ajax globably?
[12:43:59] <Eviltwin> andrew9184: Have you looked at this? http://tablesorter.com
[12:47:30] <puneet_> jarray52: the problem is in target_top
[12:48:01] <puneet_> jarray52: As it is not correctly calculating
[12:48:10] <jarray52> puneet_: I noticed a similar problem. However, you should output all the variables in an alert statement so that you can determine which variable is not as expected.
[12:48:46] <jarray52> puneet_: I typed my remark before reading your last two comments.
[12:49:31] <basiclaser> text elements within a parent should center align if the parent is set to text-align:center; right?
[12:50:24] <jarray52> puneet_: Have you fixed your problem?
[12:51:00] <jarray52> When I include jquery-1.7.2.js in a php .tpl file, I see the following error in the web browser console. TypeError: a.style is undefined. The error keeps repeating itself thousands of times. What could be causing this issue?
[12:51:08] <puneet_> jarray:no buddy.... I will never be able to fix my problem as I am not a jquery master
[12:52:39] <puneet_> jarray52:no buddy.... I will never be able to fix my problem as I am not a jquery master
[12:53:10] <diablo> Ungy, thanks for helping out, I'll keep digging
[12:53:36] <puneet_> jarray52: Will you be able to sort out my problem?
[12:54:49] <jarray52> puneet_: If I knew the cause of the problem, I would tell you. When I debug stuff, I typically have the entire project in front of me. I don't have the rest of the site.
[12:55:36] <puneet_> what you need to sort out this issue jarray52
[12:56:47] <jarray52> puneet_: If the problem is with target_top or target_offset, then put an 'alert(target_offset);' and 'alert(target_top);' in front of every occurrence of target_top and target_offset.
[12:57:03] <puneet_> ok
[12:57:26] <jarray52> puneet_: Then, try to see what is wrong with the values of target_top and target_offset.
[12:58:08] <puneet_> Target offset is showing--- object object: jarray52
[12:58:25] <jarray52> puneet_:what about target_top?
[12:58:28] <puneet_> jarray52: and target_top is not calculating the correct value
[13:00:16] <puneet_> jarray52: I've modified the script with alert(target_top); just see the results at your end
[13:04:16] <jarray52> puneet_: alert(target_offset.left) after line 52
[13:04:34] <puneet_> jarray52: ok
[13:05:16] <puneet_> jarray52: after removing the alert(target_top)
[13:06:20] <puneet_> jarray: done
[13:06:55] <Ziggy`> Anyone used isotope?
[13:07:42] <puneet_> jarray52: Check now
[13:08:48] <rebel_yell> hey anyone have any luck with turbo links?
[13:09:05] <basiclaser> Hey guys do margins behave normally in a flexbox?
[13:09:22] <basiclaser> eg. margin-left:25%;
[13:09:35] <basiclaser> it doesn't seem to work for me
[13:10:35] <rebel_yell> im havign trouble opening a twitter bootstrap modal
[13:10:46] <rebel_yell> after i get  anew page throuh ajax
[13:10:48] <rebel_yell> any help?
[13:11:46] <offlim>  quick question does anyone know to the use getscript and append it to a div id?
[13:13:41] <Ungy> rebel_yell try .on
[13:13:59] <Ungy> what is get script?
[13:14:41] <Ungy> oh you mean jQuery.getscript()
[13:15:29] <Ungy> offlim why woudl you need to append it to a div?
[13:15:29] <rebel_yell> document.on
[13:15:54] <Ungy> http://api.jquery.com/on/ google is your friend
[13:15:58] <hyshai_> hi guys
[13:16:01] <puneet_> jarray52: its also calculating the wrong values
[13:17:26] <hyshai_> does a .trigger("paste") not have .originalEvent property?
[13:20:15] <hyshai_> put another way - when a callback is registered to the paste event then the obj that's passed has an originalEvent property
[13:20:26] <offlim> Ungy: because its a script that needs to be loaded in a div
[13:21:36] <hyshai_> but when that callback is triggered via .trigger("paste") the passed object doesn't have that property
[13:22:03] <hyshai_> i'll show an example - hang on
[13:23:47] <Ungy> offlim interesting
[13:23:52] <FELS__1> anyone here use JQuery mobile ?
[13:25:11] <FELS__1> i have some pages that transition and it seems to have a "bump" any idea how to make it super smooth?
[13:25:44] <Ungy> offlim I do not see how you could do it with getscript
[13:26:00] <offlim> Ungy: then what would i use?
[13:26:36] <NoiseEee> offlim: why would it matter where a <script> is placed in the DOM?  what do you mean by append it to a <div>?
[13:28:02] <Ungy> offlim oh I dunno maybe create a script tag and append it to teh div?
[13:28:25] <Ungy> NoiseEee I think he might have some directdocument.write or somethign like that
[13:28:29] <hyshai_> whats up with this - http://jsfiddle.net/2uxEr/
[13:28:33] <offlim> i need to load a javascript file into a div
[13:28:45] <NoiseEee> offlim: your request makes no sense.
[13:29:47] <NoiseEee> offlim: var scr = $('<script>',{src:'http://example.org/script.js'});   $('someDivID').append(scr);
[13:30:55] <Ungy> offlim var d = document.getElementById('your div id');var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'yoursource file here'; d.appendChild(s);
[13:35:21] <Ungy> if you do what I did you can also bind a call to occur after load by doing something like this before appending if (s.readyState) { s.onreadystatechange = function() { if (s.readyState == "loaded" || s.readyState == "complete") { s.onreadystatechange = null; /*call  your function here */} }; } else s.onload = function(){ /*call  your function here */ };
[13:35:41] <Ungy> but you know whatever you want to do is cool
[13:36:08] <Ungy> NoiseEee's version is much prettier
[13:36:13] <offlim> Ungy: I was using that code before but the source file is not loading and i think because there is document.write within the source file
[13:36:46] <Ungy> the code I just posted you were using before?
[13:36:54] <offlim> yes
[13:37:06] <Progster> trying to run a basic jsfiddle, runs fine in chrome and IE, firefox reports ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[13:37:16] <Progster> even though I've obviously enabled jQuery
[13:37:18] <Eviltwin> Progster: How about you share said fiddle
[13:37:44] <Ungy> offlim well that is code puled from my library handler and it always works for me so I am not sure
[13:37:54] <offlim> Ungy: not the load after, the first code
[13:38:06] <NoiseEee> offlim: if the JS you're trying to get remotely uses document.write, you're SOL
[13:38:17] <NoiseEee> offlim: all of this sounds sketchy anyhow
[13:38:55] <Ungy> offlim well you know you could just call teh element itself and make changes rather than calling a document.write
[13:39:39] <Ungy> NoiseEee isn't it possible to grab it as a string and insert it though?
[13:40:13] <offlim> Noise i need to call that js file because im using a api and i need that file to load after the api form is submitted sucessfully
[13:40:16] <NoiseEee> Ungy: assuming he's executing the script he's fetching, and it uses document.write, there's not much you can do... document.write is going to mess up all events etc on the page
[13:40:17] <Ungy> I wouldn't want to attempt it though
[13:40:50] <Progster> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/hR34g/
[13:40:59] <Progster> only is a problem with jQuery 1.7.2
[13:41:06] <Ungy> yeah true didn't think  about that I haven't used document.write in years
[13:41:07] <Progster> works fine with all other versions of jQuery
[13:41:47] <Eviltwin> I'm not seeing any errors in any browsers
[13:42:08] <Ungy> Progster you are missing a # in that jquery identifier
[13:42:13] <Progster> already tried reinstalling firefox
[13:42:20] <AntonLejon> I'm not an expert, but isn't it possible to just replace document.write with something like #id.html()?
[13:42:24] <Eviltwin> Where is this error arising from?
[13:42:27] <Progster> http://jsfiddle.net/hR34g/1/ - fixed doesn't help
[13:42:34] <Progster> ctrl+ shift + k - firefox console
[13:42:46] <Eviltwin> That's where you're seeing there was an error
[13:42:47] <Progster> chrome and IE are fine, and so is firefox for every jQuery OTHER than 1.7.2... WTF?
[13:42:48] <Ungy> works for me Progster
[13:42:53] <Eviltwin> Where is it saying the error is?
[13:43:06] <Ungy> Progster yoru cache of 1.7.2 might be corrupted
[13:43:09] <Eviltwin> Does it still happen in this view? jsfiddle.net/hR34g/show/
[13:43:14] <Progster> [16:42:17.313] ReferenceError: $ is not defined @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/:25
[13:43:33] <Progster> Eviltwin: yes
[13:43:43] <Progster> Ungy: how would I kill it from cache
[13:44:01] <Ungy> Progster I have it happen every once and a while I have to delete my cache on firefox
[13:44:12] <Ungy> Progster then I restart Firefox
[13:45:31] <FELS__1> so any idea how I get a smoother transition for page nav usgin JQM
[13:45:38] <Ungy> OK I gotta get back to my validation framework I know I can make it cleaner and faster
[13:45:41] <Progster> nope
[13:45:46] <Progster> [16:45:33.928] ReferenceError: $ is not defined @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/:20
[13:45:48] <shoky> what. a node.complete property for images that are already loaded. still learnin new shit bout jquery
[13:46:22] <Ungy> shoky huh?
[13:47:04] <Progster> wtf... I've never had such strange behavior before
[13:47:26] <Progster> cache cleared, firefox restarted. Tried reinstalling firefox
[13:47:53] <Ungy> did you uninstall before reinstalling?
[13:48:03] <hyshai_> can someone help me with .trigger()
[13:48:06] <Progster> lol yes
[13:48:07] <hyshai_> ?
[13:48:37] <FELS__1> hyshai_, you have to pull the trigger :)
[13:48:41] <Ungy> Progster I dunno sir reinstall windows whiping everythign out?
[13:49:32] <Ungy> hyshai_ ask a full question
[13:49:53] <Progster> fucking firefox
[13:51:39] <hyshai_> does .trigger () trigger the actual event?
[13:51:45] <hyshai_> see my example
[13:51:47] <hyshai_> http://jsfiddle.net/2uxEr/
[13:51:51] <shoky> Ungy: this  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AV4pJ/
[13:52:00] <Progster> got it
[13:52:16] <Progster> firefox wasn't playing well with fiddler... certificates were being denied all over the place
[13:54:49] <shoky> hm or is this not a jquery thing at all
[13:54:52] <hyshai_> it seems like an "native" event that's triggered via .trigger() isn't the real native event
[13:55:06] <Ungy> shoky doesn't look like it to me
[13:55:54] <shoky> Ungy: ok makes more sense then, totally forgot about it
[13:55:54] <Ungy> shoky by the way it looks to me like you are reloading every time anyways
[13:56:18] <shoky> Ungy: that's browser dependent
[13:57:18] <Progster> is there a way I can make an AJAX request purposely fail?
[13:58:12] <Ungy> Progster call  something that doesn't exist?
[14:03:34] <plipp> What is wrong with this: 	$('#barcodes tr:last').after('<tr>' + data['bcs'] + '</tr>');
[14:05:08] <plipp> alert(data['bcs']) shows the string, and  $(h1).html(data['bcs']) works as well..
[14:05:31] <didiergm> plipp missing <td> ?*
[14:05:51] <Ungy> plipp you could try .last() instead of :last
[14:07:55] <plipp> didiergm: I'm sorry to waste your time. I need to learn my html..
[14:08:40] <plipp> didiergm: That's a "thanks"  :)
[14:08:49] <didiergm> plipp np each & every one of us started one day;
[14:09:08] <Eviltwin> But most of us didn't start in #jquery, we started with books :P
[14:09:23] <Ungy> plipp also it is noted that $('#barcodes tr').filter(':last') will perform better
[14:09:40] <Eviltwin> .last() performs better than $('...:last') or .filter(':last')
[14:09:49] <Ungy> Eviltwin speak for yourself I started with stone tablets
[14:10:21] <didiergm> Eviltwin - when you say perform better you mean faster or ?
[14:10:39] <plipp> Eviltwin: Yes, that's why I apologized, I didn't think it was a "valid" question. :)
[14:10:40] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:11:04] <plipp> Eviltwin: ...when I realized I didn't even know my html..
[14:11:50] <Ungy> well plipp you could always rewrite your own dtd and make tr not require td's
[14:12:29] <Ungy> plipp because conforming is so passe
[14:13:33] <plipp> Ungy: Ah yes, embrace individualism, enbrake (that's not a word, but it sounds good) evolution.
[14:13:52] <Ungy> I remember when HTML didn't support tables you youngsters have it so easy
[14:14:22] <Eviltwin> I remeber when HTML didn't even have tags, you had to write it all in binary
[14:14:41] <didiergm> Ungy - was it the time when you had to deliver your web site by hand, on puch cards ? aaahh memories :)
[14:14:43] <Eviltwin> All you lazy bastards now have no idea how hard it used to be
[14:14:43] <Ungy> Oh well crap that is beyond me I started with html 1.0
[14:14:58] <Ungy> I used punch cards
[14:15:20] <Ungy> every played 864 card pick-up when someone forgot to number there cards
[14:15:27] <plipp> Eviltwin: I was around when HTML was only ML, except the 'M' wasn't working. That's why I didn't know about the 'td'
[14:15:29] <Ungy> their
[14:16:11] <melkor> What is the synonym of element.appendChild?
[14:16:43] <plipp> elephant?
[14:16:53] <Eviltwin>  I think you mean homonym
[14:17:01] <Eviltwin> Or homophone
[14:17:15] <didiergm> Ungy me too, fond memory of getting my first sorting program on cards and letting slip the box full of my program .... taught me a lesson that day
[14:17:51] <melkor> I mean something that is different, becuase appendChild isn't a method, but it does the same thing.
[14:17:54] <Ungy> didiergm well if it was only a day must have been a small program
[14:18:17] <plipp> different? Synonot?
[14:18:17] <melkor> homophone sounds the same, but is different.
[14:18:31] <didiergm> Ungy - :)
[14:19:07] <Ungy> didiergm did you have an auto feeder or did you hae to do it by hand?
[14:19:26] <Eviltwin> melkor: appendChild is a method...
[14:19:42] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.appendChild
[14:20:28] <melkor> Eviltwin: yes in dom, I must have a different error then. I used $('#elementId').appendChild and got a no method error.
[14:20:43] <Eviltwin> melkor: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:20:45] <Eviltwin> Read the docs
[14:20:52] <melkor> Eviltwin: I am.
[14:21:09] <didiergm> Ungy punching one by one; reading an auto feeder, but you had to read the 1st stagfe compiler then your source that would punch a pcode then 2nd stage compiler  would punch executable :  lines prog +/-minutes
[14:21:10] <Eviltwin> http://jqfundamentals.com
[14:21:13] <melkor> Eviltwin: so does $() have a .append child?
[14:21:17] <Ungy> eh a jquery object callign straight dom that woudl be interesting
[14:21:31] <basiclaser> what are the terms for sizing an image relative to its normal size?
[14:21:32] <melkor> Eviltwin: I see that .append() should do the same thing so clearly I have another error.
[14:21:56] <Eviltwin> melkor: A jQuery collection has an append method, it does not have an appendChild method
[14:23:02] <melkor> Eviltwin: thank you. I am ver new to the jquery, but I am familiar with dom, so I do not know when they cross over.
[14:23:18] <Eviltwin> I recommend reading the docs and reading the jQuery Fundamentals thing I linked after
[14:23:21] <Eviltwin> It'll help you get up to speed
[14:29:38] <Ungy> also melkor if you know the ID straight JS is faster
[14:29:47] <plipp> Eviltwin: Just a question about jQuery /ajax convention/features..  I want to know when one or more more objects are available on the server. Is the normal procedure to use a timer and send in, for example, the id of the last received element or timestamp..  or are there something cool built-in?
[14:30:56] <josePHPagoda> I'm trying to get a function to fire when a div is changed (like, when it updates via ajax) any ideas on how to do it?
[14:31:16] <josePHPagoda> i looked into .bind() but it seems to be deprecated
[14:31:28] <plipp> Eviltwin: As you can see, I'm not a web-developer.. but just gathering some insight into this before focusing on the right elements to read about. In parallel to this, I am going through some books properly..
[14:31:34] <Ungy> josePHPagoda why not put a success function on the ajax call
[14:31:47] <josePHPagoda> because other things may edit that div
[14:32:16] <josePHPagoda> ^ Ungy
[14:32:35] <melkor> Ungy: since I have added jQuery certain dom functions have stopped working properly, but work fine with a jQuery equivalent.
[14:33:44] <Ungy> melkor your telling me that jQuery which uses dom functions causes dom functions to break?
[14:34:01] <Ungy> josePHPagoda umm try the on method I guess
[14:34:46] <josePHPagoda> Ungy: I'm reading through that, but how do I get it to fire on the various node events?
[14:35:09] <Ungy> sounds like you need to design something on that div
[14:35:25] <Ungy> like anytime an event occurs in it you need to update soemthign that can be watched
[14:35:32] <chilversc> melkor: what dom functions?
[14:35:49] <josePHPagoda> $('#myDiv').bind('DOMNodeInserted DOMNodeRemoved' is what I tried... but it doesn't seem to ever fire.
[14:35:53] <melkor> Ungy: I don't understand it myself, and it is very possibly just some dumb error on my part. I had a toggle method, that would check an element for .disabled=="none". If it was none it would change it to block, and if it was not none it would change it to none.
[14:37:18] <josePHPagoda> same if I chnge .bind to .on
[14:37:35] <Ungy> melkor as long as your looking int eh right place it should work
[14:38:23] <melkor> Ungy: if the id is wrong I would get an error. Plus it would always work once, then be finished. If this isn't a known problem then it is probably something I was missing.
[14:40:11] <Ungy> josePHPagoda I do not knwo what to tell you sir
[14:40:37] <NoiseEee> josePHPagoda: yeah thats not gonna work
[14:40:57] <NoiseEee> josePHPagoda: your best bet in terms of watching for DOM changes is probably the mozilla css-animation hack
[14:41:27] <Eviltwin> Ugh, JavaScript is going to be causing the DOM changes
[14:41:30] <Eviltwin> You're writing the JavaScript
[14:41:36] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't need DOM events to know when the DOM changes
[14:41:48] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: does click() bind to the body by default?
[14:41:54] <someprimetime> when using shorthand .click()?
[14:41:58] <NoiseEee> right, what Eviltwin says (presuming your JS is doing it).  doDomStuff();  followupActions()
[14:42:02] <josePHPagoda> Yeah, I might just make sure that each ajax call fires this off
[14:42:07] <someprimetime> err delegate to that, that is
[14:42:10] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Uh... no, it's a shortcut for .bind('click', ...) effecively
[14:42:11] <NoiseEee> but if another script is doign it, you might want to check out http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion @ josePHPagoda
[14:42:26] <Eviltwin> .on('click', ...)
[14:42:28] <Eviltwin> See here: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[14:42:30] <Eviltwin> It's explained
[14:42:31] <someprimetime> right.. I was just viewing the source
[14:42:39] <someprimetime> K
[14:42:41] <someprimetime> thanks
[14:43:59] <someprimetime> Thoughts on using attr('data-whatever') to get data attributes and data('whatever', 'foobar') to set data on a DOM node even if the data being set isn't being returned the server?
[14:44:00] <neataroni> i have a jquery mobile listview, and i would like each item to be a link to the detail view of that item. I need to make an ajax request with GET param to get the details of the item- how should i lay this out? is there a way i can just make another data-role=page on the page and somehow have it not make a request till that page gets navigated to?
[14:44:11] <someprimetime> Or should data() be used for both getting and setting data attributes now?
[14:44:22] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: This is where the .click(...) method comes from: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event-alias.js#L1-11
[14:44:36] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: tbh i prefer using the attributes of "data-" because you're then able to select elements via data- attribute
[14:44:38] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: .data() doesn't set data attributes
[14:44:46] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks I actually had that copy and pasted
[14:44:52] <someprimetime> but I couldn't find where on() is declared
[14:45:39] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: I know it doesn't actually set them, but if I'm "storing" data with them.. is it better to get the original value with attr() and then update it with data()?
[14:45:47] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L714
[14:45:50] <someprimetime> I know the internal data on the node will change on it
[14:46:10] <Eviltwin> It's faster to use .data() because it doesn't change DOM attributes, it just changes vars in JavaScript
[14:46:21] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: it doesn't really matter if you're not planning on using data- in a selector
[14:46:25] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: so that'd be the best method?
[14:46:29] <Eviltwin> Changing DOM attributes (or modifying the DOM in any way) is more expensive than var fiddling in JavaScript land
[14:46:35] <Ungy> OK I gotta get peace
[14:46:45] <NoiseEee> me, i often try to get $('[data-productid="123xxf"]')
[14:46:47] <someprimetime> Yeah that was my initial preminition
[14:46:49] <someprimetime> cool
[14:46:55] <melkor> I make a new span and add it to a div that I grabbed via $(#divId). If I set the id, I cannot add the span to the div. I've tried two different ways to set the id. The append works w/out setting the id.
[14:47:21] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ melkor
[14:47:22] <b-ot> melkor: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:47:22] <bot-t> melkor, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:47:49] <melkor> Eviltwin: sounds good, Ill try.
[14:49:20] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: would using $('.div').attr('class', 'newclasses') be better than $('.div').removeClass().addClass('new classes')?
[14:49:24] <someprimetime> Probably not, right?
[14:49:35] <someprimetime> The removeClass function is kinda hefty (looking @ it)
[14:49:43] <someprimetime> plus addClass also needs to be called
[14:49:52] <someprimetime> Nm attr is probably the way to go
[14:52:20] <melkor> I don't even know what is wrong with this? jsfiddle.net/5z3U9/
[14:52:38] <melkor> It seems like addThingy would be defined but it isn't.
[14:58:59] <melkor> So, how do I get the javascript to be included with the html?
[14:59:02] <someprimetime> jsperf is so unreliable
[15:02:39] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: can you tell me why $(val) within $.each(function(i, val) is slower than $(this) in the same method?
[15:02:50] <someprimetime> Something with the mapping of `val`?
[15:02:54] <someprimetime> Curious.
[15:03:14] <melkor> I got something to work. http://jsfiddle.net/5z3U9/ but I was hoping to use $('#top-div').
[15:06:09] <josePHPagoda> wootsauce with bacon! I got it working!
[15:06:09] <josePHPagoda> :)
[15:34:38] <pardis> If I have a huge select box list, which one is better to clear it  --  $('#myselectbox').empty()    or   $('#myselectbox').html('')  or $('#myselectbox option').remove()
[15:39:23] <dcherman> pardis: .empty()
[15:40:39] <pardis> dcherman: thanks

[15:46:55] <garbagecollectio> hey
[15:47:03] <garbagecollectio> how can i add an ajax:before on a dynamically created element
[15:47:08] <garbagecollectio> .on doesn't work
[15:47:27] <garbagecollectio> i did document.on(click, a.class, function() {}).on(ajax:before)
[15:47:29] <garbagecollectio> but that doesn't work
[15:50:41] <dannymichel> I'm looking for a way to open a youtube link in a div instead of opening a new youtube page, and all i can find when i google is how to open it in a popup. Any ideas?
[15:51:40] <ridicter> Hey all, AOL Video embeds only work with JQuery 1.9 (not 1.8), but when we include the JQuery Migration 1.1.1 it breaks the AOL video embed.   Does anyone have any tips on going about resolving this?
[15:53:12] <Che-Anarc> I have a tiny_mce area in jQuery Mobile... is there anyway I can bind a function globaly to when it shows is availble? - perhaps via:  $("div:jqmData(role='page'):last") ?
[15:54:39] <coldhead> ridicter: ryanneufeld suggest not including the migrate plugin
[15:54:45] <coldhead> suggests*
[15:55:07] <ryanneufeld> It's my first day using jquery though
[15:55:12] <ryanneufeld> so I'm just guessing
[15:55:14] <ridicter> coldhead: When we exclude migrate, it breaks our slideshow :-(
[15:55:35] <ridicter> Ah I see, yeah I'm a newbie as well
[15:55:40] <coldhead> ridicter: i assume the slideshow is relying on $.browser
[15:55:45] <ryanneufeld> ridicter: use migrate to find the problems in your slideshow
[15:55:47] <ryanneufeld> fix those
[15:55:50] <ryanneufeld> and then take it out
[15:56:14] <coldhead> you make it sound so easy, ryry
[15:56:47] <ryanneufeld> isn't though clod? isn't it?
[15:58:33] <ridicter> coldhead: is $.browser deprecated?
[15:59:43] <coldhead> yes
[15:59:44] <coldhead> well
[15:59:48] <coldhead> it used to be deprecated
[15:59:52] <coldhead> now it's actually removed
[16:01:58] <ridicter> Ah I see...
[16:04:00] <coldhead> so your slideshow has had several years in which to wean themselves off using .browser
[16:04:10] <coldhead> and you should complain to them if they haven't fixed it yet
[16:04:22] <coldhead> or better yet, fix it and send them a pull request :D
[16:08:56] <ridicter> thanks for your guidance!  I'm looking into it...
[16:18:03] <Tomashe> hey guys there is some issue with live function on new jquery release?
[16:18:20] <Tomashe> jquery-1.9.1.js
[16:19:34] <vladikoff> Tomashe, live is dead
[16:20:24] <vladikoff> Tomashe, http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#live-removed
[16:20:51] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[16:20:54] <Tomashe> so what now
[16:21:03] <vladikoff> Tomashe, read ^
[16:21:59] <Tomashe> yes i saw
[16:22:01] <Tomashe> on is now
[16:22:02] <Tomashe> :)
[16:23:27] <Tomashe> and any idea why dragable isnt working
[16:23:59] <coldhead> is the mouse unplugged?
[16:24:11] <ReBa_> Does anyone has some experience with photobox? I like to show the photobox through a textual link. Like: go to gallery -> photobox shows up!
[16:25:36] <neataroni> can i pass a callback to any function in javascript?
[16:26:34] <Tomashe> its not do anything
[16:26:35] <Tomashe> :/
[16:29:04] <rickardo> Tomashe: they removed .live().  Do a find & replace for .live and replace it with .on
[16:29:21] <rickardo> save 2 bytes per occurence ftw!
[16:33:23] <mdunham918_> hey guys I have a problem I'm hoping I can fix with jQuery. In IE9 if you have an element with a gradient and rounded corners the background will bleed through. A simple fix would be to search for any element with rounded borders and a gradient and wrap that element in a div set to the same dimensions as the problem element. Then set the new outer div to overflow hidden and apply the border radius to it
[16:33:48] <mdunham918_> is there a plugin out there that you guys have heard of that would allow me to search for elements that have a type of css
[16:34:34] <mdunham918_> like search my css for those elements and wrap them in a div that doesn't change anything about positioning or sizing and applies the css to that div rather than the inner one
[16:34:41] <mdunham918_> aw hell I should just write this
[16:35:13] <shoky> .filter() would help
[16:39:10] <mdunham918_> is there a way in jquery to say find ('[css[border-radius]]')  something like that
[16:39:19] <mdunham918_> i need to search the actual stylesheet i guess
[16:39:57] <ReBa_> You're trying to find out which elements are styled?
[16:42:13] <Tomashe> this on isnt like live
[16:42:19] <s34n> I have a <select> inside an accordion that disappears when I resizable() it
[16:42:41] <Tomashe> when i update new form using post() the on. isnt effecting on those new elements like live
[16:42:54] <s34n> By disappear, I mean it becomes 1/2 pixel tall, with part of the border showing
[16:44:52] <s34n> If I roll the mouse over it just right, I can get a handle and resize it
[16:45:41] <s34n> ah. it's a containment problem
[16:46:21] <s34n> except that I don't specify containment
[16:48:38] <s34n> but the problem only happens if the resizable() occurs while the accordion section containing the control is closed
[16:49:04] <s34n> if the accordion is open when I resizable() the control, there is no problem
[16:49:49] <da-beginner> hi.. for jquerymobile, can i have data-role="button" but without click functionality? is there a build-in parameter for this?
[16:51:15] <s34n> da-beginner: which element are your styling as a button?
[16:51:38] <da-beginner> a p element
[16:51:44] <da-beginner> <p class="item_on_sale" data-role="button">SALE</p>
[16:52:44] <s34n> da-beginner: p elements don't have any click functionality by default
[16:53:12] <s34n> So yes, you can have that with click functionality
[16:53:20] <s34n> err... without
[16:54:33] <da-beginner_> s34n: i guess i am referring more to the jquerymobile css
[16:54:59] <shoky> mdunham918_: no there's no way to do that, which is why i suggested .filter()
[16:55:12] <da-beginner_> s34n: the css automatically places a hover and link cursor etc.. and i was just wondering if we can disable that by default by adding data- something
[16:55:32] <s34n> da-beginner_: jquerymobile css doesn't magically give the p element click functionality
[16:55:37] <mdunham918_> shoky: cool I'm going with the approach of looking for anything with certain classes
[16:55:49] <mdunham918_> actually
[16:55:52] <mdunham918_> i went with css3pie
[16:55:56] <shoky> ew
[16:56:41] <s34n> da-beginner_: so you want a p to look like a button, but without the cursor side effects and no actual click interaction?
[16:56:44] <da-beginner_> s34n: themeroller i suppose
[16:57:11] <da-beginner_> s34n: yes. i guess the themeroller did that by default
[16:57:57] <garbagecollectio> how can i stop an ajax request on a dynamically added link
[16:58:14] <paxcoder> is the browser going to HEAD first to check for changes when using getJSON?
[16:58:46] <s34n> da-beginner_: just make your own css class that does what .ui-button or whatever does without the parts you don't want.
[16:59:16] <paxcoder> or must i check for changes, and cache myself for when there are none?
[16:59:35] <s34n> garbagecollectio: what makes your link do an ajax request?
[16:59:46] <garbagecollectio> a rails thing called jquery-ujs
[17:00:28] <s34n> garbagecollectio: rails can't make your browser do something. You loaded some js library?
[17:00:30] <garbagecollectio> so i did this document.on('click', 'a.classname', function() { $(a.classname).trigger('ajaxbefore', function() { blah blah)
[17:00:32] <garbagecollectio> will that work
[17:00:35] <garbagecollectio> sorry thats psuyedo code
[17:01:29] <s34n> garbagecollectio: you want to completely prevent the ajax request? remove the event listener.
[17:02:11] <garbagecollectio> no
[17:02:18] <garbagecollectio> pause it, do something, and then restart
[17:02:28] <garbagecollectio> or do something before it, but only when one thing is clicked
[17:02:57] <s34n> garbagecollectio: you can't pause an ajax request. You mean you want to sneak in and do something else first?
[17:03:28] <garbagecollectio> yes
[17:04:04] <s34n> garbagecollectio: remove the event listener, put your own listener up that eventually calls the original handler
[17:06:52] <paxcoder> is HEAD implicit when using getJSON?
[17:08:04] <paxcoder> -_-
[17:09:20] <garbagecollectio> s34n
[17:09:37] <s34n> garbagecollectio: ?
[17:17:51] <rickardo> How can I get the jQuery element on a screen by position?
[17:18:12] <rickardo> so $td = $.elementOn(230, 500);
[17:18:14] <rickardo> or something
[17:18:55] <rickardo> Or otherwise, how can I get the element behind an absolutely positioned and higher ordered z-index div on click?
[17:20:17] <gates> In jQuery Mobile- Is there a way to define functions for each page and it not be duplicate?
[17:21:53] <gates> when i pull up a facebook ui dialog it pops up in the wrong (inactive) window
[17:29:51] <gates> I don't follow how jQM allows you to create functions and scripts
[17:34:56] <dannymichel> I'm looking for a way to open a youtube link in a div instead of opening a new youtube page, and all i can find when i google is how to open it in a popup. Any ideas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15124975/open-youtube-video-link-in-a-div
[17:59:23] <iheartjs> dannymichel, http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=171780
[17:59:27] <panzi> when I create a script tag with $('<script type="text/javascript"></script>).attr("src", "http://example.com/script.js") jQuery automatically adds ?_=12345...
[17:59:32] <panzi> how can I prevent this?
[18:02:01] <iheartjs> panzi, out of curiousity, why not use getScript?
[18:02:32] <iheartjs> panzi, that incidentally will add a time stamp by default but the docs have ways around it: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[18:03:24] <panzi> iheartjs: because there is actually html code before the <script> tag and the chunk will be appended to the document later on. I try to dynamically load pinterrest buttons
[18:10:07] <heimann> How would one go about writing a script where, in search result, when one clicks an entry (instead of going to the listing for that entry) the entry expands to show the listing right in the search result?
[18:16:17] <naeluh> hey can any one see why the colorbox plugin doesnt work but when I remove jquery.zoomooz.js from external sources colorbox works ? here is the fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/bCtpe/
[18:16:33] <naeluh> let me know I can provide any other info
[18:18:28] <naeluh> I feel its gotta be something in here in http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site5/js/jquery.zoomooz.js
[18:20:25] <tw2113> uh oh, i found danheberden on vimeo last night :O
[18:20:48] <jrockjiggz> How would i go about refering to an element i've APPENDED without needing to select it?
[18:21:29] <tw2113> store it in a variable before appending?
[18:21:54] <danheberden> tw2113: the presentation or the amateur adult film?
[18:22:05] <tw2113> Deferreds
[18:22:21] <tw2113> so...presentation of amateur adult film?
[18:22:37] <jrockjiggz> $('<p/>').appendTo('body').css(dosomething); does that make sense?
[18:23:38] <shoky> jrockjiggz yup. also:  var p = $('<p/>');  $('body').append(p); p.css(something);
[18:23:47] <jrockjiggz> cool
[18:24:31] <jrockjiggz> also, what do you think of:  $('<p id="tip"/>') --or-- $('<p/>').prop('id','tip'); ?
[18:24:52] <shoky> the former
[18:24:59] <jrockjiggz> really?
[18:25:02] <jrockjiggz> i'm suprised
[18:25:06] <someprimetime> prop() is never used for changing an attribute
[18:25:09] <someprimetime> well
[18:25:13] <someprimetime> not an `id` at least
[18:25:14] <tw2113> less chaining in general too
[18:25:18] <jrockjiggz> yes
[18:25:18] <jrajav> Not like it matters for jQuery construction, but <p/> is technically invalid HTML these days
[18:25:19] <tw2113> wouldn't you use attr()
[18:25:20] <shoky> good thing id is a property
[18:25:20] <someprimetime> generally form elements
[18:25:24] <someprimetime> prop('selected', true)
[18:25:26] <someprimetime> e.g.
[18:25:27] <jrajav> That's old XHTML syntax
[18:26:05] <jrajav> You should use <p></p> for non-void elements and <input> for void elements
[18:26:09] <jrockjiggz> well, whats the different $('<p>') or $('<p></p>') or $('<p/>')
[18:26:13] <someprimetime> o
[18:26:16] <someprimetime> s/o//
[18:26:32] <jrajav> Too late.
[18:26:43] <jrockjiggz> jrajav: so you mean. use $('<p></p>') ?
[18:26:56] <jrockjiggz> i dont think i've ever seen
[18:26:59] <someprimetime> jrockjiggz: use $('<p />'); if you want a self closed paragraph tag
[18:27:04] <jrockjiggz> normally in examples I see $('<div />')
[18:27:05] <someprimetime> that you can append() stuff into
[18:27:05] <shoky> he said it doesnt matter for jquery
[18:27:07] <jrajav> Yeah, like I said, it doesn't matter for making elements with jQuery
[18:27:13] <jrajav> But if you're actually putting that in HTML
[18:27:15] <jrajav> Don't
[18:27:16] <jrajav> :P
[18:27:22] <jrockjiggz> yea ;p
[18:28:48] <acidjazz> put it in you rmom
[18:28:56] <acidjazz> in your moms whathaveyou
[18:30:03] <coldhead> >: |
[18:36:37] <jrockjiggz> i modified a lightweight tooltip plugin, trying to keep it light http://jsfiddle.net/MFfJu/
[18:36:42] <naeluh> can anyone see what wrong with this plugin file I think with the clickTarget.on("click", function (evt) - http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AzvmB/1/ this is really tricky
[18:37:01] <naeluh> it keeps breaking colorbox
[18:37:32] <naeluh> some part of the zoomooz plugin is stopping the click from working in colorbox
[18:38:02] <Wolfed> Apparently HybridAuth sucks big time.
[18:38:13] <naeluh> please if can see something that would be awesome
[18:38:22] <naeluh> anyone

[19:17:51] <anjen> Hi, Iwant to create a function that I can attach directly , ie, $('.some_class).myFunc(blah), instead of myFunc(some_class,blah). but I don't even know what that's called. Anyone can maybe clue me a bit?
[19:19:21] <anjen> Is that what's meant by "extensible"?
[19:22:06] <firedfox> anjen: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring

[19:51:44] <Primux> Can someone help me out with a coding puzzle I can't solve? I need to figure out how to add a class to all of the cells in a row when a user selects a radio button which is in the first cell of the row.
[19:52:24] <Primux> When I say it's a puzzle, it's not like homework I'm trying to cheat on, I'm just trying to figure out how to do this. When I first put it in my todo list I put it at the top, because I thought it'd be easy, but it's turning out not to be so easy.
[19:52:54] <Primux> The table is generated by PHP, so I can't just set everything in the row to have a class & add CSS to the class.
[19:57:34] <Eviltwin> Primux: http://jsfiddle.net/vp23f/ ?

[20:05:35] <Primux> Hey thanks for that link! That's exactly what I needed!
[20:05:48] <Primux> Did you google that or just know where it was? And if you googled it, what query did you use?
[20:35:44] <Waldro> Hello everyone. I am trying to set up a simple ajax call with jquery, which uses .get to send some <input> data to a PHP script. The PHP script returns XML, which I can see in the response. My question is: why does this code not display the text from the <IsValid> element from the XML response?
[20:35:54] <Waldro> Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/K3nqc/

[21:16:02] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, I noticed a function in a website that I'm working on, even ajax queries that I make a little "loading" bar pops up
[21:16:09] <lethjakman_lapto> what's the event to bind to to be able to do this?
[21:17:00] <coldhead> ?ajaxstart
[21:17:01] <bot-t> .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[21:17:28] <lethjakman_lapto> sweet! thank you coldhead
[21:17:37] <lethjakman_lapto> do you happen to know if this is possible in vanilla JS?
[21:17:49] <coldhead> i don't know and i don't care
[21:17:58] <coldhead> ajax in vanilla JS is so awful
[21:18:04] <coldhead> i'd rather have my face eaten off
[21:18:10] <coldhead> (it's probably possible somehow)
[21:18:22] <lethjakman_lapto> it's gotta be, but probably not nearly as nicely
[21:18:38] <lethjakman_lapto> I do like jqueries magic, but it's kinda hard to use with my snippets
[21:32:01] <Waldro> why doesn't the <div id="return> show the test of <IsValid> in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/K3nqc/
[21:33:13] <jiko> you mean line 9?
[21:34:44] <Waldro> jiko nevermind i didn't load jquery :(
[21:34:45] <Wolfed> Anyone here somewhat familiar with Facebook's PHP SDK?
[21:34:47] <Waldro> stupid mistake
[21:34:58] <jiko> unfortunately i am wolfed.
[21:35:03] <Wolfed> Can't seem to get this ajax request to work.
[21:35:15] <Wolfed> Why am I not surprised @ unfortunately :P
[21:35:34] <jiko> facebook software is garbage
[21:35:34] <boytoy> Can somebody spot what's wrong with my lightbox (Yabox) setup? http://jsfiddle.net/YvAF8/
[21:35:40] <Wolfed> Care to give me a hand? Not sure if this is an issue with my ajax request
[21:35:52] <jiko> yeah, show me code 8-]
[21:36:02] <Wolfed> Since apparently it is not working with ajax only.
[21:36:30] <jiko> it works without ajax?
[21:36:34] <Wolfed> Yeah
[21:36:39] <Wolfed> Its simply a login test
[21:36:51] <jiko> what's firebug say?
[21:36:54] <Wolfed> Not much more than that
[21:37:02] <Wolfed> Nothing really.
[21:37:06] <Wolfed> Let me give a small briefing.
[21:38:16] <jiko> ok go
[21:38:35] <Wolfed> My site has a div, which once clicked loads "social index" page though ajax, which checks with $facebook->getUser() to see if someone is logged in or not. If you are not, it throws $facebook->GetLoginUrl() link
[21:39:20] <Waldro> jiko: i was wrong, i did load jquery correctly. yes line 9
[21:39:22] <Wolfed> Now, I have this script which once you click the login url, opens a popup which directs you to the login page and then closes once you're logged in. Once it closes, the "social index" div gets reloaded
[21:39:39] <Wolfed> Now, I have this script which once you click the login url, opens a popup which directs you to the facebook's login page and then closes once you're logged in. Once it closes, the "social index" div gets reloaded
[21:39:50] <Wolfed> Sorry I repeated myself, had to clarify it was facebook's login page :P
[21:40:29] <Wolfed> Now, if I access via ajax to my social index and click the login button, Popup opens, asks for permissions, closes and div reloads, still asking me to login
[21:40:47] <Wolfed> if I print_r($_SESSION) I only get fb_state session, nothing else seems to be set
[21:40:59] <jiko> do you have the callback set properly in your facebook app settings?
[21:41:13] <Wolfed> Yeah, thats how it manages to close.
[21:41:56] <Wolfed> Now, I just tried directly accessing my social index page. without any javascript. Got asked to login, clicked it and got the entire page redirected to facebook, and then back to my original social index page, this time I am logged in.
[21:42:09] <Wolfed> Then I clicked my social div to load up and it shows me as logged in.
[21:42:26] <Wolfed> So apparently, something is wrong with my ajax loads
[21:42:44] <Wolfed> Seeing it works fine when javascript has nothing to do with the login proccess
[21:42:48] <jiko> how are you authenticating them in the callback?
[21:43:15] <Wolfed> In no way? lol!
[21:43:27] <Wolfed> I have to authenticate them myself?
[21:43:37] <Wolfed> Thought Facebook did that for me, seeing it works without ajax
[21:43:53] <jiko> i mean when you pop to facebook, facebook sends a signal back and you have to auth them
[21:43:55] <Wolfed> (I should note I am a full noob to the PHP SDK)
[21:44:01] <jiko> but that's not with ajax
[21:44:29] <Wolfed> Was using a built-in library before which worked fine, but response times were awful. (+9 seconds)
[21:44:39] <jiko> the ajax should only be checking if the user is autheticated in the first place
[21:45:12] <Wolfed> Yeah, but I mean. If I attempt the login proccess without Ajax, it works just fine, despite no callback authentification method being set
[21:45:32] <jiko> hmm.
[21:45:40] <Wolfed> My callback url simply stores the access token and the facebook ID into my database
[21:45:50] <jiko> is that happening?
[21:46:21] <Wolfed> With ajax, no. Without it, yes.
[21:46:38] <jiko> you keep saying ajax but when you pop open the window it's not ajax anymore :P
[21:46:39] <oojacoboo> can I use a jquery deferred/promise with any arbitrary code?
[21:46:44] <Wolfed> Well not sure if its entirely an ajax issue
[21:46:45] <Wolfed> Yeah
[21:46:50] <Wolfed> thats what I was going to say just now :P
[21:47:04] <Wolfed> So wait.. I got a light bulb in my head...
[21:47:12] <jiko> o___O tumor?
[21:47:18] <oojacoboo> like, I have some code that I need to execute before anything else is called b/c subsequent code strains the browser.  So, I want to execute other code prior so it looks like it didn't freeze
[21:47:25] <Wolfed> If I am issuing the login through a popup, which closes... then my session is being destroyed... right?
[21:47:51] <Wolfed> So.... I can't actually get a session if its being destroyed...
[21:48:04] <Wolfed> VOILA! You're a genius!
[21:48:06] <jiko> haha. use a cookie :P
[21:48:25] <Wolfed> Now to figure out how in the name of jeebus I am going to pass my session from one window to another
[21:48:35] <jiko> i know how to do it ;)
[21:48:43] <jiko> gimme a sec
[21:48:45] <Wolfed> Yeah, I just don't know how do fb session's work to set the data
[21:48:54] <Wolfed> Since it doesnt work with cookies
[21:51:13] <jiko> well, you would set the cookie in the callback
[21:51:41] <Wolfed> Yeah
[21:51:44] <jiko> or you could create a request placeholder in your initial ajax call and then fulfill it in the callback
[21:52:00] <jiko> then set an event for when the window closes to check the state
[21:52:03] <Wolfed> I just don't know how to to actually create facebook sessions with the given data
[21:52:07] <Wolfed> Thats where I got kinda stuck
[21:52:21] <Wolfed> Trying to read the documentation, but its awful
[21:52:33] <jiko> i use an event listener to send the data from the child window to the parent
[21:52:35] <Wolfed> I mean, it lacks a lot of info sometimes
[21:53:47] <jiko> user clicks login, checks to see if there's a "remember" cookie, pops a window to facebook, facebook says everything is cool and redirects to my callback, the callback saves them, stores a cookie, and outputs a tiny javascript that closes the window and sends the new user info the parent
[21:54:54] <Wolfed> Yeah, that much I get, I am just wondering how to manually create a facebook session
[21:55:07] <jiko> and yeah it gets confusing until you do the flow 100 times. pretty much every oauth service is the same
[21:55:20] <Wolfed> rofl
[21:55:26] <Wolfed> So I have a long night ahead of me :P
[21:55:29] <jiko> well, you don't need a session
[21:55:38] <Wolfed> Actually, yeah
[21:55:46] <Wolfed> I can put on th access token and the uid in the ajax request
[21:55:52] <jiko> are you just logging in to facebook to authenticate them? or are you acting for them?
[21:56:18] <Wolfed> At this point, just logging in, but I am going to add a post to facebook button
[21:56:37] <jiko> well, once facebook says they're logged in you don't need to do anything else with facebook
[21:56:56] <jiko> create an identifying cookie for your login system and store their facebook credentials with it
[21:57:00] <Wolfed> Thing is my API does not recognize me as logged in.
[21:57:09] <Wolfed> Yeah, I am reading into that
[21:57:19] <jiko> facebook will do it but you should use their client-side api
[21:57:27] <Wolfed> http://graph.facebook.com/$userID/friends?access_token=$userAccessToken
[21:57:35] <jiko> it checks for login when the page loads and handles all that weird popup nonsense
[21:57:40] <Wolfed> That might work, retriving the data from cookies
[21:57:55] <Wolfed> lol
[21:58:01] <Wolfed> Well I am just getting myself into it
[21:58:14] <Wolfed> I'll look into the Javascript once I am slightly more familiar with the PHP one
[21:58:22] <Wolfed> So I can figure out which one works better for my purposes
[21:58:26] <jiko> it will work but you still need your script to check if facebook finished it's thing
[21:58:43] <jiko> when the popup closes, your script doesn't know
[21:59:15] <jiko> unless you use an event message before it closes or you have some kind of interval timer checking for a state change
[21:59:49] <Wolfed> Yeah, I am using an interval timer
[22:00:42] <Wolfed> my callback url handles the cookie setup and doesnt output anything else to the user, but a window.close()
[22:01:00] <jiko> stick the data in a database
[22:01:43] <jiko> the initial ajax can store a request identifier and the callback url can modify the identifier
[22:02:06] <jiko> the timer checks to see if the identifier was modified :P
[22:02:59] <Wolfed> Oh yeah, I am using hashed stuff as a security measure :P
[22:03:33] <jiko> it wouldn't be anything super important, use md5(rand) or whatever as long as it's unique
[22:03:41] <Wolfed> Yep
[22:03:58] <Waldro> jiko can you help me
[22:04:06] <jiko> with what?
[22:04:24] <Waldro> http://jsfiddle.net/K3nqc/
[22:04:41] <Wolfed> Thanks a lot jiko, helped a bunch :)
[22:04:54] <jiko> you're welcome :)
[22:05:35] <jiko> what's your XML look like waldro?
[22:05:38] <jiko> is it actually valid?
[22:05:54] <jiko> or is there actually an <IsValid>
[22:06:25] <jiko> do a console.log(JSON.stringify(data)); and see what it shows
[22:07:36] <Waldro> json?
[22:07:39] <Waldro> where did that come from?
[22:09:33] <jiko> or use firebug
[22:09:40] <Waldro> here
[22:09:41] <jiko> i always use JSON instead of XML lol. sorry, habit
[22:09:49] <Waldro> http://jsfiddle.net/K3nqc/2/
[22:09:52] <Waldro> there is the XML
[22:11:25] <jiko> ok gimme a minute
[22:11:43] <tdignan> xml is a great document format, and a lousy serialization format.
[22:11:50] <tdignan> json, clearly superior.
[22:11:53] <tdignan> for the latter.
[22:11:54] <jiko> ^agreed
[22:12:16] <jiko> i just don't like unnecessary characters in my data lol
[22:13:34] <Waldro> i'm not going to be doing that much with the xml though
[22:14:29] <jiko> waldro, it seems that the XML should be different depending on the search, yeah?
[22:16:18] <jiko> also you should use $("#return").empty().append(isval); instead of .text
[22:16:26] <jiko> or $.html()
[22:19:29] <jiko> waldro, this works: http://jsfiddle.net/K3nqc/4/
[22:19:35] <jiko> using the XML you provided
[22:22:33] <puneet> Hello Friends I have written this code http://pastebin.com/Ef0iNfV1 to slide an image on hover but I want the image to get back to the active menu item. How can I accomplish that?
[22:22:59] <Waldro> jiko: that pretty much does the same thing mine does
[22:23:27] <Waldro> except i'm running mine on localhost
[22:24:41] <raj> can a key be null or undefined?
[22:24:43] <raj> is that ok?
[22:26:23] <tw2113> you can return null on keypress
[22:26:35] <tw2113> for the specific key
[22:27:03] <jiko> yeah i set up a demo on my localhost
[22:27:17] <jiko> using jquery 1.9.1 and it worked with that html
[22:27:26] <jiko> so the other option is that your php script isn't outputting valid xml
[22:27:38] <jiko> make sure you're setting the content-type in the headers
[22:27:42] <jiko> and did you check firebug?
[22:27:57] <jiko> worked with that xml*
[22:28:20] <Waldro> i have the charset to utf-8 and mime to text/xml
[22:28:41] <Waldro> it could be the XML, but i see it escaped in the response and it gives me a 200 response code
[22:28:45] <Waldro> so i'm really not sure
[22:28:48] <puneet> Can anyone help me please?
[22:28:51] <jiko> check the $.get response in firebug to be sure
[22:28:57] <jiko> it should create an XML tab if it's valid
[22:29:49] <devil> hello
[22:29:57] <devil> Are u there ben ?
[22:30:10] <Waldro> it says it isn't
[22:30:26] <Guest99530> Are u there ben ?
[22:30:45] <Waldro> jiko
[22:30:45] <Waldro> XML Parsing Error: not well-formed Location: moz-nullprincipal:{0e8f2b4e-06f0-45e0-934c-91c0340f7d30} Line Number 3, Column 1:

[22:30:49] <Waldro> is the error i get
[22:31:24] <systemfault> Why is your XML escaped?
[22:31:30] <jiko> yeah don't escape it
[22:31:34] <Waldro> it looks escaped in the response i said
[22:31:38] <Waldro> i didn't escape it myself
[22:32:03] <Waldro> the XML is in revision 2
[22:32:49] <jiko> should look like this http://cdn.joejiko.com/images/624169d50511f7788441f3490fbe6badf57d624b.jpg
[22:33:04] <jiko> everything in your fiddle is OK
[22:33:13] <jiko> so your php isn't outputting the XML correctly
[22:33:27] <Waldro> i just echo it
[22:33:34] <Waldro> should i do something different?
[22:33:45] <jiko> where is it coming from?
[22:33:56] <Waldro> amazon api
[22:33:58] <jiko> it's being formatted before you echo it
[22:35:25] <puneet> Hello Friends I have written this code http://pastebin.com/Ef0iNfV1 to slide an image on hover but I want the image to get back to the active menu item. How can I accomplish that?
[22:36:30] <Waldro> omfg
[22:36:39] <Waldro> he answers me half way and then leaves
[22:36:45] <Waldro> and systemfault chimes in for no reason
[22:36:50] <Waldro> so annoying
[22:40:17] <puneet> \please help me out guys
[22:54:36] <sunuslee> hi, if a event(like click) is already has a default action, i can use preventDefault to run my own action, but how can i "append" my action to execute after the default action?
[23:02:31] <djQuery> yo
[23:03:04] <djQuery> sunuslee, errr no that is not what preventDefault will do
[23:03:37] <djQuery> sunuslee, say you have  a form and you are binding to the form's submit.
[23:04:02] <djQuery> preventdefault would prevent the form from actualy posting to the server
[23:06:01] <djQuery> puneet, have u looked at ui.position
[23:06:25] <djQuery> ?ui.position@puneet
[23:06:25] <bot-t> puneet, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[23:07:12] <djQuery> ?hoverintent@puneet
[23:07:14] <bot-t> puneet, hoverIntent - jQuery Plugin Registry - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[23:10:38] <relipse>  i have a weird error i'm using PHPExcel to import an excel spreadsheet, well for some reason its finding the stored date values to be in the format 11-31-44 (for 11/31/1944), and strtotime() is failing on what seems to be all dates probably because they are missing the 19......what do I do?
[23:16:52] <tw2113> explode the value by - and then prepend the 19 to the 3rd array index, then implode it back
[23:18:23] <relipse> tw2113 is that safe?
[23:18:47] <relipse> i mean i dont want it to be a hack only for this specific version
[23:19:39] <tw2113> what wouldn't be safe about it?
[23:20:13] <tw2113> as an aside, why are you asking php Q's in #jQuery ?
[23:20:26] <relipse> i got banned from both php channels
[23:20:34] <Eviltwin> ...
[23:20:34] <esas> :]
[23:20:36] <relipse> one for talking about Jesus and the other for advertising
[23:20:43] <Eviltwin> Great
[23:20:47] <relipse> yeah it happens
[23:20:49] <Eviltwin> Why should we keep you here?
[23:20:58] <relipse> i haven't done anything wrong here?
[23:21:06] <Eviltwin> Good point so far
[23:21:12] <Eviltwin> But how do you know you won't do anything wrong?
[23:21:17] <tw2113> so you thought this would be a good room to try next?
[23:21:29] <relipse> yeah i figured there were some php programmers in here
[23:21:54] <relipse> i actually semi-fixed the problem using this: $date = DateTime::createFromFormat('m-d-y', $hm['birthday']);
[23:21:57] <tw2113> probably not on purpose
[23:22:19] <relipse> but the problem with THAT code is it "guesses" 2044 instead of 1944
[23:22:40] <Eviltwin> Well you're going to have to draw an arbitrary line
[23:22:43] <esas> just do you own function that evaluates the year
[23:22:48] <Eviltwin> It's why we don't use two-digit years any more
[23:22:59] <relipse> no i think the problem is the PHPExcel library showing the date as 2 digits
[23:23:02] <esas> if the year is after the current 100's year, apply 19, otherwise 20
[23:23:12] <relipse> i'll have to open an xls file and check what microsoft did
[23:23:28] * tw2113 waits for js questions
[23:23:40] <relipse> moment.js is an awesome library go look at it
[23:23:46] <relipse> for all you non-php guys
[23:23:55] <tw2113> which is used too late for php
[23:24:04] <relipse> someone made moment.php
[23:24:19] <relipse> ok i'm going to check microsofts file
[23:24:25] <relipse> open in a notepad++
[23:24:48] <boytoy> At this simple lightbox setup: http://jsfiddle.net/M75jm/ - how do I get it to load each div's h1 and not all the div's h1s?
[23:25:20] <raj> the fact that .data() camelCases your keys is retarded
[23:25:36] <relipse> ok i saved the file as CSV and the dates were full years
[23:26:10] <relipse> crap i think the problem is in the PHPExcel
[23:27:13] <relipse> yep someone had same problem: http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/workitem/19154
[23:31:15] <boytoy> err sorry just noticed wrong fiddle nevermind
[23:31:22] <boytoy> H-H-HEH
[23:43:08] <relipse> ok well along the same lines, waht is a good 2 digit to flip to above 2000 or below 2000?
[23:43:20] <relipse> actually i could use the current year
[23:43:26] <relipse> since it is a birthday
[23:56:36] <intelligentfool> hi, can anyone recommend a better way to write this? http://pastebin.com/uaYQLBwS
[23:56:47] <intelligentfool> not sure how to avoid writing the same code twice
[23:58:55] <Cork> intelligentfool: on('keyup focusout', function()
[23:58:57] <relipse> intelligentfool: write a function and then call the function instead
[23:59:21] <relipse> cork on with the better answer
