[00:00:15] <Cork> LukeNukem: you should not use onclick when you add script like this
[00:00:23] <coldhead> benjick: it's a binary tree
[00:00:26] <flaccid> ok so http://jsfiddle.net/qaqsu/
[00:00:31] <coldhead> provied each node has at most 2 leaves
[00:00:34] <Cork> it doens't refere to scopes so if your script is wrapped you can't access your function
[00:00:35] <benjick> coldhead: Thank you, been bugging me all day
[00:00:41] <benjick> coldhead: Yes
[00:00:47] <coldhead> what you have there is actually two trees
[00:00:59] <LukeNukem> Corey, coldhead i know i was just trying it out because normally i would bind it and be done with that
[00:01:01] <LukeNukem> but it works different here
[00:01:05] <flaccid> the Content-Type header in the return is missing, but for another call, its application/xml but when using dataType : "jsonp application/xml", this doesnt help
[00:01:06] <benjick> Well, I was just drawing carelessy in paint :)
[00:01:39] <coldhead> just keeping you honest, LukeNukem
[00:01:43] <coldhead> stay strong
[00:02:25] <Cork> LukeNukem: parse the button html with jquery before you append it, and use that variable to bind a click action instead
[00:03:29] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://notey.it/n/Ymc
[00:03:31] <LukeNukem> Cork, thats what im doing in the initialize function
[00:03:43] <Cork> no
[00:03:46] <LukeNukem> oh
[00:03:47] <LukeNukem> like this
[00:04:37] <Cork> LukeNukem: userscripts run in its own wrapper, its not accessable from global in the page
[00:04:39] <flaccid> Cork: flaccid: the server should return application/javascript or text/javascript <-- the i need it to handle other content/mime types as this is an api client. how to do?
[00:04:50] <Cork> so you can't use inline click events, as they can only access global functions
[00:05:27] <Cork> flaccid: your sure the server returns jsonp and not just json?
[00:05:30] <LukeNukem> thanks Cork
[00:05:53] <Cork> flaccid: cause an api server that returns jsonp as text/plain is broken
[00:06:11] <systemfault> Also.. usuallyâ€¦ jsonp calls need a callback.
[00:06:18] <Cork> flaccid: check that the response starts with function <name>() {}
[00:06:19] <systemfault> Because it's an ugly hack.
[00:06:29] * Cork nods
[00:06:34] <coldhead> it's not that ugly!
[00:06:38] <coldhead> you should see my mamma
[00:06:43] <Cork> its super ugly
[00:07:01] <systemfault> coldhead: I don't think I shouldâ€¦ :/
[00:07:11] <Cork> lol
[00:07:14] <coldhead> given how much javascript loves function scope, wrapping data in a function isn't SO crazt
[00:07:17] <coldhead> or ugly
[00:08:17] <flaccid> Cork: ok yeah i guess i'm trying to do cross domain jsonp with a server that doesn't return jsonp right?
[00:08:25] <LukeNukem> not working Cork
[00:08:41] <Cork> flaccid: sounds like your trying to do jsonp with a server that returns json ya
[00:08:48] <Cork> flaccid: and thats not posible
[00:08:53] <flaccid> Cork: coz if no json, then Access-Control-Allow-Origin right
[00:09:04] <Cork> yes
[00:09:13] <Cork> for the browsers that supports that
[00:09:25] <Cork> == no ie, ff > 3.5
[00:09:43] <Cork> opera ?
[00:09:50] <flaccid> this was chrome
[00:09:51] <tw2113> people support Fx3.5 still?
[00:10:06] <Cork> flaccid: i mean those browser won't be able to to it later either
[00:10:14] <Cork> tw2113: ppl use old browsers like mad
[00:10:21] <Cork> tw2113: but no 3.5 is eol
[00:10:22] <tw2113> they are mad for that fact
[00:10:33] <Cork> (3.6 has 5 days until eol)
[00:10:40] <flaccid> Cork: so only real solution is upgrading the http server for the api to support jsonp return, right?
[00:10:58] <Cork> flaccid: or proxy it over the domain you have the site on
[00:11:25] <Cork> 3-4 lines of php should be able to handle that
[00:11:42] <Cork> (including the start and end php scrip tag :D )
[00:11:50] <flaccid> Cork: so like decoupling by creating a jsonp.my.rightscale.com ?
[00:12:16] <Cork> no like adding a proxy-site-url.php
[00:12:19] <Cork> to your site
[00:12:25] <Cork> and then calling that to get the json
[00:12:32] <Cork> it in turn uses get_contents
[00:12:40] <systemfault> o_O
[00:12:45] <thomedy> whoa my drupal instal has been operating on jquery 1.2.6 thats crazy
[00:12:49] <Cork> *file_get_contents
[00:13:02] <thomedy> its time to update
[00:13:22] <systemfault> thomedy: 1.2.6 is prehistoric.
[00:13:35] <systemfault> 1.4.x is oldâ€¦.
[00:13:39] <coldhead> so many memories
[00:13:49] <Cork> when i started using drupal it used jquery 1.0 :)
[00:13:50] <coldhead> you guys remember 1.2.4?
[00:13:52] <Cork> that was fun :D
[00:14:04] <systemfault> coldhead: I was 2 years old.
[00:14:06] <flaccid> ok i see, thanks cork
[00:14:20] <systemfault> coldhead: I was using it with my lake.class java applet.
[00:14:26] <systemfault> coldhead: On geocities.
[00:14:37] <coldhead> you must have better memories than me, systemfault, i was already an old man with dementia then
[00:15:19] <flaccid> Cork: hmm i thought i'd be able to use dataType : "jsonp text xml"
[00:15:41] <coldhead> in ur dreams
[00:15:44] <LukeNukem> Cork,
[00:15:47] <LukeNukem> any idea mate?
[00:16:00] <Cork> flaccid: what jsonp does is create a <script> tag with the link to the external javascript file
[00:16:15] <Cork> flaccid: on the script tag it attached a load event listner
[00:16:33] <Cork> flaccid: when the script is loaded it executs the predefined function and grabs the return value
[00:17:04] <Cork> LukeNukem: no i don't, never used jquery in userscripts, i usually run barbone there
[00:18:01] <flaccid> Cork: i can see the xml in the http response in dev tools, it obviously isn't wrapped in a function, but i want to somehow get this because it could take some time to update the endpoint
[00:18:09] <LukeNukem> Cork, barbone? o.o
[00:18:26] <Cork> LukeNukem: pure js
[00:18:28] <Cork> no framework
[00:18:35] <LukeNukem> raw js
[00:19:06] <Cork> LukeNukem: your calling between prived js and content js
[00:19:20] <flaccid> so the situation as discussed is basically this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3435454/using-jsonp-when-returning-xml
[00:19:27] <Cork> so you might actually have to create a script tag add your js to it and insert it into the page
[00:19:45] <LukeNukem> Cork, thats smart
[00:19:50] <LukeNukem> i can do that in the init function
[00:20:04] <Cork> one sec
[00:20:45] <LukeNukem> Cork, is it ok to do something like $('head').append("<script></script>");
[00:21:06] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://wiki.greasespot.net/Content_Script_Injection
[00:23:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> is showBorder() a jquery, javascript or custom function?
[00:23:28] <trond-> hi room. Is there a way to get the parameter that was used when I have loaded a html-document/asp.net page?
[00:23:52] <Cork> document.location.search ?
[00:24:41] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: custom
[00:24:41] <LukeNukem> Cork, this did the job http://notey.it/n/Ymg
[00:25:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I got some help putting my code together, and are using the KineticJS framework, but when upgrading to the latest version, it says this.showBorder is not a functiona >.<
[00:25:13] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Thanks Cork
[00:36:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ok, removing that destroyed my code :( Ah, well, better ask the guys on the kinetic forum what to do then...
[00:37:32] <tocka> How could I make next/prev links for my parallax slider? I have all my menus in an array #a, #b, #c :|
[00:37:39] <tocka> if this helps..
[00:38:55] <LukeNukem> anyone here use the imgur api?
[00:41:07] <coldhead> i'm familiar with not using it, LukeNukem
[00:41:10] <coldhead> that's probably no help
[00:41:13] <coldhead> sorry
[00:44:11] <LukeNukem> oh wow look a troll.
[00:44:46] <coldhead> pfft, that's not trolling
[00:44:53] <coldhead> you have so much to learn little LukeNukem
[00:45:02] <coldhead> it almost makes me sad i won't be around to see it
[00:45:14] <coldhead> but alas i am so terribly old
[00:45:18] <tocka> Cork sorry to bother but maybe you know how from this
[00:45:29] <tocka> I could make a next link to other slides?
[00:46:16] <LukeNukem> coldhead, rest in peace old man
[00:46:27] <coldhead> thanks whippersnapper
[00:47:59] <Cork> tocka: menu.eq(menu.index(this) +1)
[00:48:50] <tocka> Maybe you could edit that code? I would really appreciate it
[00:48:56] <LukeNukem> Cork, random question.. how can i get the url of the current window
[00:49:38] <Cork> location.href
[00:49:57] <LukeNukem> window.location.href is fine too ?
[00:50:15] <Cork> normally its the same thing yes
[00:50:25] <Cork> document.location.href should work too
[00:50:37] <DannyZB> http://pastebin.com/RsfSTDeE
[00:50:42] <DannyZB> what did I do wrong there
[00:50:46] <DannyZB> the data isn't getting passed
[00:50:58] <LukeNukem> var imgurcontent = "<iframe src='http://imgur.com/api/upload/?url="+onPagelink+"> </iframe>'";
[00:51:13] <LukeNukem> $('head').append("<script type='text/javascript'>$('#imgurit').on('click', function(e){e.preventDefault(); $('body').html(imgurcontent) });</script>");
[00:51:14] <LukeNukem> }
[00:51:17] <LukeNukem> what am i doing wrong here?
[00:51:58] <DannyZB> why are you using $("head").append ?
[00:53:30] <Cork> DannyZB: is data_in an object or what?
[00:53:41] <DannyZB> it's a simple array
[00:53:47] <DannyZB> it's the data I want to be passed in the query
[00:53:53] <DannyZB> and it's not getting to the PHP side ><
[00:54:05] <Cork> DannyZB: then you need { my_data: options.data_in }
[00:54:28] <Cork> DannyZB: params need to be a key value paire
[00:54:35] <Cork> -e
[00:54:40] <DannyZB> lol you've gotta be kidding me
[00:54:50] <DannyZB> oh one sec
[00:54:51] <Cork> no, thats what params are
[00:54:51] <DannyZB> yes they are
[00:54:54] <Cork> by defenition
[00:55:48] <DannyZB> http://pastebin.com/kEwyzcv1
[00:55:56] <DannyZB> thats the calling code , I did use pairs
[00:56:05] <DannyZB> ignore the lack of callbacks I cut them out of the paste
[00:56:37] <tocka> Cork i cant figure it out where that little bit of code goes
[00:56:50] <tocka> ;/
[00:57:28] <Cork> tocka: that code goies into the click event for the changes
[00:57:32] <Cork> *changer
[00:58:18] <Cork> DannyZB: and the url is on the same domain?
[00:58:48] <DannyZB> The URL is fine , I checked the data load in CHROME and it loads the page ... on the other side I get an empty $_REQUEST array
[00:59:22] <Cork> DannyZB: can't tell why it would fails from the code
[00:59:26] <coldhead> what's not working, LukeNukem ?
[00:59:33] <Cork> DannyZB: would need a demo to be a able to tell more
[00:59:36] <DannyZB> Bah ><
[00:59:45] <coldhead> what happens if you run that code direct from the console?
[00:59:53] <DannyZB> I can't give you a demo there's a bunch of PHP there .. thats the problematic code I already narrowed it down
[01:00:14] <Cork> DannyZB: ya, but its partial, and dead code
[01:00:21] <Cork> and you can't run a debugger over that
[01:00:22] <DannyZB> anyway It's officially a phantom bug (c) 2012
[01:01:30] <DannyZB> thx for the help
[01:03:04] <LukeNukem> coldhead, nvm i figured out the problem
[01:03:14] <DannyZB> I even checked : data_in isn't empty when I pass it to $.ajax
[01:03:46] <coldhead> good work LukeNukem
[01:06:05] <LukeNukem> coldhead, can i ask you a question about user scripts
[01:07:41] <coldhead> of course
[01:08:09] <coldhead> and based on my many years of web dev experience at the coal face in the trenches, i will probably not know the answer
[01:08:17] <coldhead> AT THE COAL FACE IN THE TRENCHES
[01:08:45] <LukeNukem> in user scripts
[01:08:46] <LukeNukem> there is
[01:08:53] <LukeNukem> /@match http://something.com
[01:08:57] <LukeNukem> what does taht do
[01:09:52] <DannyZB> I FOUND A BUG IN JQUERY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[01:10:01] <DannyZB> haha I knew it had to be correct code
[01:10:17] <DannyZB> the moment I pass data to a JSON query as "GET" instead of "POST" it starts to work
[01:10:50] <coldhead> good question, LukeNukem
[01:10:54] <coldhead> do you got a link for that?
[01:12:55] <LukeNukem> coldhead, link?
[01:14:41] <coppa> https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-position-align-limit for some GROOVY minimal layout manager
[01:16:40] <xec> is something wrong with github? i don't get the css styles for some reason
[01:17:57] <coldhead> LukeNukem: http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts
[01:18:20] <coldhead> the RHS is the URLs for which this script should be run, if it @matches
[01:18:35] <coldhead> see for instance the scripts for the popular dump.fm
[01:18:47] <coldhead> which @match http://*.dump.fm/
[01:20:45] <cortexman> jquery ui draggable seems pretty choppy here dont you think? http://grey.colorado.edu/LightBox/
[01:21:13] <cortexman> (starting with your second drag of the same element, there seems to be a discontinuous jump in box position)
[01:33:09] <coldhead> right, bugger all this then
[01:36:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> This is not a jquery specific question, but related... I have a jquery script for handling mouse events on an image and there's something wrong with it, however the error console shows no errors. When I "step" through the script in FireBug, it always breaks on the MouseOver event, how can I get FireBug to ignore this, so I can get to the real error?
[01:39:38] <SoulRaven> hi
[01:39:43] <SoulRaven> please help me with something
[01:40:12] <SoulRaven> what is the diff between a normal call and ajax call
[01:40:25] <SoulRaven> because i want to simulate if is posibile a normal call using ajax call
[01:40:30] <ChrisTheSorcerer> AJAX shoots off the call without updating the entire page
[01:40:50] <SoulRaven> i am using cakephp and when i call a security component using ajax it breaks
[01:41:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Asynchronous Javascript And Xml ;)
[01:45:12] <ChrisTheSorcerer> So noone knows how to disable certain breakpoints in FireBug?
[01:45:31] <tehlulz> All us kool kids use chrome
[01:45:48] <cortexman> how do i specify one of my own funs for click? .click('update(' + i + ')')
[01:47:19] <cortexman> above code results in, i.e., Object update(12) has no method 'apply' in chrome inspector
[01:48:39] <Cork> uh...
[01:48:52] <Cork> you never use strings in the event handlers
[01:49:18] <Cork> if you want to use custom arguments to your function callback use .click(function() { update(i) });
[01:49:29] <cortexman> i see..
[01:49:35] <cortexman> thanks
[01:49:55] <cortexman> this function() { } stuff seems so weird to me!
[01:50:06] <LukeNukem> Cork, how can i replace the text inside an element
[01:50:08] <Cork>  make sure the i variable is declared into the parent scope
[01:50:09] <LukeNukem> .text() ?
[01:50:17] <Cork> LukeNukem: or .html
[01:50:30] <Cork> they will both replace child elements though
[01:50:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork unfortunately, Chrome is not an option right now, and IE is shit, so I'm stuck with FF
[01:51:06] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: not sure what you mean
[01:51:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry, too used to you replying, of course I meant tehlulz >.<
[01:51:43] <Cork> :D
[01:52:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I have your name on the clipboard for quick replies :P
[01:53:06] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: script tag breakpoints tab > uncheck the breakpoint you want to temporarly disable
[01:53:49] <Cork> *script tab
[01:54:04] <LukeNukem> Cork, i want to find this in the dom
[01:54:05] <LukeNukem> <span class="default_message">Like</span>
[01:54:16] <LukeNukem> how can i go about doing that.. i want the one with Like as text
[01:54:29] <Cork> hmm
[01:54:30] <cortexman> Cork, what did you mean by "make sure the i variable is declared into the parent scope". i presume i have encountered the problem you anticipated
[01:54:42] <cortexman> (i is always its final value in the loop - 20)
[01:54:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Thanks, Cork
[01:54:50] <Cork> LukeNukem: well you can use the :contains selector, thought its a bit slow
[01:55:37] <stian133> i have multiple divs on the same page, each with a differing number of input elements inside them. I am trying to, depending on how many input elements each div contains, run an if else statement. However I'm having problems counting the number of inputs inside each div. Using length returns every input on the entire page even when i do $(".divName input").length I get all inputs on the page. Can anyone help me with this? Sitting at work right now
[01:55:37] <stian133> and i really need this to work, thanks a lot for any help!
[01:55:45] <reellsid> Hey, did you ever have a problem with "touchstart" in older versions of IOS? The "touchstart" event is interpreted as "click" event. Does anyone know this problem?
[01:55:45] <Cork> cortexman: if you do for(var i=0;i<100;i++) { elm.eq(i).click(function() { update(i) }) }
[01:56:07] <Cork> cortexman: i will only exist as one instance and it will be replaced on each loop
[01:56:17] <Cork> cortexman: so you need to cache it localy in the scope
[01:56:32] <Cork> cortexman: for(var i=0;i<100;i++) { var j=i; elm.eq(i).click(function() { update(j) }) }
[01:56:45] <cortexman> interesting. thanks
[01:59:41] <stian133> so, to summarize, how can i count the number of input elements inside a single div, when there are multiple divs with input elements on the same page?
[02:02:06] <xec> stian133: $(".className input") will only select inputs inside en alement with class="className"
[02:02:16] <xec> an*
[02:02:21] <Cork> stian133: you could select the div based on an id, or a class, or an argument or its position in the dom
[02:02:57] <xec> element*
[02:03:24] <stian133> its a webshop selling sushi, and each product page has differing numbers of divs (class="product") each containing some sort of fish
[02:03:32] <cortexman> Cork, could you take a look at this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/Fmxdx/
[02:03:59] <xec> ?p @ stian133
[02:03:59] <bot-t> stian133, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:04:10] <stian133> the problem is that i have multiple divs with the same class, and i cannot give each their unique id/class
[02:04:47] <xec> stian133: what are you checking number of inputs for?
[02:05:19] <Cork> cortexman: you could prob build that with a delicated event handler instead
[02:05:37] <Cork> cortexman: but ya, that looks correct
[02:05:49] <cortexman> (except for the missing semicolon)
[02:05:52] <cortexman> but it has the same bug
[02:06:11] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to remove X-Requested-With from ajax calls?
[02:07:02] <Cork> cortexman: ah... ya, for loops doesn't create scopes >_<
[02:07:09] <Cork> one sec
[02:07:17] <stian133> xec: because if number of inputs exceed a certain number, i want to collapse the box (choosing sushi options can be very many different combinations, and no need to show them all by default)
[02:07:29] <stian133> http://jsfiddle.net/GaS9a/1/ (don't think i got that right though)
[02:08:02] <stian133> i want to return the number of inputs for each respective div
[02:08:15] <xec> stian133: you could loop through them using .each()
[02:08:52] <stian133> interesting
[02:09:06] <stian133> i will read up on that
[02:09:09] <stian133> thanks
[02:09:15] <xec> stian133: http://jsfiddle.net/GaS9a/2/
[02:09:46] <Cork> cortexman: http://jsfiddle.net/Fmxdx/1/
[02:10:05] <xec> stian133:  but then you would only have the number inside that loop, which is why i asked what it is for :)
[02:10:20] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to remove X-Requested-With from ajax calls?
[02:10:34] <SoulRaven> or simulate a normal request using a ajax call?
[02:10:52] <stian133> thanks for helping me out :) basically if the number is below f.ex 4, i want to hide a link that expands the box
[02:11:56] <cortexman> lol, ok, i can live with that :) thanks so much
[02:12:10] <cortexman> you have NO idea how long i spent implementing this in pure javascript before finding jquery ui
[02:12:50] <xec> stian133: ok, then you could just do that logic inside the loop
[02:13:27] <Cork> cortexman: but like i said, that code could be significantly simplified
[02:13:45] <cortexman> ok i will look into event handlers
[02:13:49] <stian133> thanks! i will try my luck now, and post back if i run into trouble, really appreciate it
[02:14:12] <xec> bare hyggelig :)

[02:18:06] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to remove X-Requested-With from ajax calls?
[02:18:07] <SoulRaven> or simulate a normal request using a ajax call?

[02:33:38] <papegaaij> hi all, is there any way to reinitialize droppables while dragging a draggable? enabling a droppable while dragging an accepted draggable does not add the activeClass
[02:40:33] <anli_> Cant I measure the height of a div before it has been appended?
[02:43:51] <quicksilver> anli_: I don't think - DOM objects can't be laid out until they are inserted into a document.
[02:44:04] <anli_> ok
[02:44:24] <anli_> I set the opacity to 0 and layout then
[02:44:56] <anli_> Maybe I should use a dummy for it
[02:49:58] <poppiez> is it possible to insert different html in three different divs at the same time causing only one reflow?
[02:50:08] <poppiez> instead of three

[03:00:27] <Woet> does someone know a jquery slider besides jquery UI? so an actual slider, not a photogallery
[03:01:29] <StevenCodes> Woet, any specifics ?
[03:01:47] <Woet> StevenCodes: no, just a simple slider which you can drag to specify a value
[03:02:04] <StevenCodes> ahhh
[03:02:12] <StevenCodes> hmm gonna check that out
[03:02:49] <StevenCodes> dont think its called a slider hmm
[03:02:52] <StevenCodes> slider control ?
[03:03:45] <StevenCodes> Woet,  http://notey.it/n/Ymk there you go
[03:04:00] <Woet> StevenCodes: err... what?

[03:11:10] <xec> stian133: doing $(".product") inside the .each() is going to select all the product divs all over again. "this" refers to the current item
[03:11:49] <StevenCodes> any ideas on how I would go about creating an Ajax Loaing Gif Generator
[03:14:41] <g0rd0n> I have a problem: I'm using jqueryui ajax tabs, and the content loaded via ajax also contains some javascript. It works perfectly up to jQuery v1.5.2, however since v1.6 the javascript inside those ajax tabs does not get executed anymore... any idea why? Can I do anything about it or do I have to stick to v1.5.2?
[03:17:40] <thecodeswe> Hello. I have a question about $.ajax().done()
[03:19:02] <stian133> Thank you so much xec :) now it works perfectly :)
[03:19:30] <thecodeswe> How do you determine what the Data argumentobject will contain? It sometimes is Document and sometimes #document (Google Chrome console)
[03:21:32] <g0rd0n> perhaps i forgot to mention that my issue only appears with IE
[03:21:58] <thecodeswe> By Data i mean: $.ajax(...).done(function(DATA, status, jqxhr){});
[03:29:18] <Kartagis> hi
[03:29:21] <Kartagis> I've found this jquery function to change divs' background color at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1535128/apply-random-color-to-class-elements-individually . how can I apply to only the menu?
[03:47:02] <thecodeswe> Does anyone know what Data in $.ajax.done() will return?
[03:54:11] <EdwardIII> hey
[03:54:32] <EdwardIII> i've got some inputs that have colons in their ID. i'm trying to use jquery validate which works like rules { fieldname: 'required' }
[03:54:42] <EdwardIII> but a hash key can't have a colon in the name. any idea how i can escape this?
[03:57:46] <nFFF> thecodeswe, the data returned from the server?
[04:00:10] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: { "hash keys can have anything in them including : colons" : "required" }
[04:00:51] <quicksilver> well-formed JSON requires quotes around the key, actually. Not that you are required to use wellformed JSON in your own stuff.
[04:00:55] <EdwardIII> quicksilver: ah right, i see
[04:01:00] <thecodeswe> nFFF: yes
[04:01:04] <quicksilver> but for anything computer-generated, it's definitely sensible to have the quotes.
[04:02:25] <EdwardIII> i'm now JSON-compliant heh
[04:03:58] <frontendloader> I'm sending out 4 ajax requests in sequence and pushing their responses on to an array. Is there a way to set up a callback for when all of the requests are completed?
[04:05:18] <quicksilver> frontendloader: promise/deferred
[04:05:55] <quicksilver> frontendloader: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[04:06:14] <quicksilver> frontendloader: there are a couple of examples at the bottom for two ajax requests
[04:06:19] <quicksilver> frontendloader: it works with four too.
[04:06:46] <frontendloader> this looks like it will do wonderfully.
[04:08:43] <cyb99> hi,  im just trying to assign a var a value with a special character, eg: $("#x").val("hello?");, i get the error "unterminated string literal", is there a way around this?
[04:10:18] <cyb99> without doing \\? as the value is passed from php
[04:11:05] <Jon47> cyb99 what's the special character?
[04:11:15] <Jon47> i think you will probably need to escape it properly in php
[04:11:28] <Jon47> but that should not be a problemâ€¦ php has lots of escaping type functions
[04:11:47] <zatan> Hi I am getting this  json response from server 'name1':" <small>(Product)</small>",   is there anyway that I can escape in getJson ?
[04:11:58] <cyb99> Jon47, its ?
[04:12:21] <Jon47> oh.. ? is not a special char
[04:12:24] <Jon47> you shouldn't need to escape that
[04:12:34] <Jon47> there must be another error
[04:12:39] <arphen> hi, are there any special cases why a bind to an event could fail?
[04:12:52] <cyb99> oh ok
[04:13:17] <arphen> i have like 20 binds in my $(document).ready, and one of those fails
[04:13:19] <arphen> but just that one
[04:13:22] <arphen> and i copypasted it too
[04:14:47] <arphen> and when i copypaste the bind to console it works
[04:15:39] <g0rd0n> ok i fixed my problems with IE by removing the <!-- and --> comment tags around the inside of <script> tags... works fine now. is there any reason to use html comment tags in scripts or am i safe now?
[04:17:39] <Cork> g0rd0n: the html comment tags are for REALLY old browsers
[04:17:48] <Cork> and no, theres no reason to use it anymore
[04:17:54] <g0rd0n> i woner why i did then :P
[04:17:57] <g0rd0n> thanks
[04:18:15] <Cork> we'r talking about things like netscape 2 and ie < 3
[04:19:09] <Cork> g0rd0n: and if your script tag was in the head, it was never needed
[04:19:27] <Cork> (and cause problem in quite a lot of browsers)
[04:19:38] <g0rd0n> Cork: it was not, but it broke IE with jquery 1.6+, removing those comments fixed my problems
[04:19:56] <techouse> can i pass a callback to fancybox's close method?
[04:20:09] <techouse> cause i wanna remove the div once it's auto closed
[04:20:21] <Cork> check the fancybox focumentation
[04:20:34] <techouse> i did, doesn't seem doable
[04:20:47] <frontendloader> so something like res = $.ajax(req); $.when(res) { //stuff } is correct?
[04:21:21] <Cork> frontendloader: what are you trying to do?
[04:21:28] <techouse> frontendloader: use success
[04:22:17] <quicksilver> Cork: he wants to wait for 4 to finish
[04:22:18] <frontendloader> success can take multiple functions?
[04:22:24] <arphen> is anything wrong with the # id="form-register" ?
[04:22:24] <quicksilver> which is why I pointed him at .when
[04:22:40] <frontendloader> There is something I want to do on the first response, and something I want to do after all responses are received.
[04:22:40] <quicksilver> it should look more like $.when(res1,res2,res3,res4)
[04:22:44] <techouse> frontendloader: a function can take as many functions as you with
[04:22:47] <techouse> wish
[04:23:39] <frontendloader> after the first response I queue up 3 more requests and set another $.when
[04:23:45] <g0rd0n> is there a way i can catch a 404 when using get? basically i want to check if a specific image is available, and if not do something
[04:24:06] <Cork> g0rd0n: .error
[04:24:14] <Cork> $.get().error()
[04:26:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, where am I going wrong here? I have this code in my HTML and want a onclick function for a search bar, but the value sent keeps getting undefined...
[04:26:35] <ChrisTheSorcerer> <input type="text" id="artSearch" /><span onmousedown="articleClick($('#artSearch').value)">LÃ¤gg till via art. nr.</span>
[04:26:44] <zatan> Hi, my json string contains html tags 'name1':" <small>(Product)</small>;  can I show this "PRODUCT" as small html tag ?
[04:27:05] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: don't use inline event handlers
[04:27:44] <Cork> zatan: just append it to the document
[04:28:24] <zatan> Corey,  But than I am getting "<small>Product</small>"   I am expecting to work as <small> as html tags
[04:28:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: What can I use instead? The text needs to be in line with the search bar, and the text needs to start the event when clicked on
[04:28:42] <Cork> zatan: how are you appending the html?
[04:29:12] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: use event listners on the dom element
[04:29:25] <frontendloader> is there a way to pass an array as individual arguments?
[04:29:39] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: ex. $('#artSearch').mousedown and so on
[04:29:53] <Cork> or you can do it on the generated dom
[04:30:24] <Cork> var search = $('<span onmousedown="articleClick($('#artSearch').value)">LÃ¤gg till via art. nr.</span>'); search..mousedown
[04:30:32] <Cork> bah...
[04:30:43] <Cork> var search = $('<span>LÃ¤gg till via art. nr.</span>'); search..mousedown
[04:31:25] <Afflicto> using jquery UI, I have created a tabs(); I want to use .on or .live to select a tab in the future. How can I do that?
[04:31:54] <ChrisTheSorcerer> so something like search.mousedown="functionForEvent($('artSearch').value)"; ??
[04:32:10] <ChrisTheSorcerer> With the # of course
[04:32:26] <Cork>  search.mousedown(function () { ForEvent($('artSearch').value; });
[04:32:51] <Cork> ?.mousedoen
[04:32:53] <Cork> ?.mousedown
[04:32:54] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".mousedoen" in jQuery Docs.
[04:32:54] <bot-t> .mousedown(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mousedown" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/
[04:33:16] <Afflicto> http://codepad.org/fJYO0lIg <- select a tab in the future.
[04:35:38] <ChrisTheSorcerer> cork: That does nothing at all... hang on, I'll pastebin the code, since it's multi-row now
[04:36:25] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: include the related code too
[04:36:35] <Cork> and use jsfiddle or jsbin or similar
[04:36:55] <humanite_> hello
[04:37:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> http://pastebin.com/NP1M2UHZ
[04:37:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry for the swedish ;)
[04:39:24] <mytoz> ChrisTheSorcerer: $('artSearch') should be $("#artSearch"), and .value should be .val()
[04:39:34] <Damian_> hello guys, is someone in here willing to help a total newb? I made a simple image rotator that changes out images and text and rotates them in an endless cycle, but it does not work at all. If you be so kind to look at my crappy script and tell me whats wrong with it I'd love you forever http://pastie.org/3796829
[04:40:21] <Damian_> I'm just a bit crowdsourcing here, I hope you don't mind
[04:40:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> mytoz: No change
[04:40:31] <humanite_> heya, i have a problem with a callback function http://jsfiddle.net/fJwWe/
[04:40:50] <larsemil> Damian_: what is not working
[04:40:51] <ParanoidGal> Complete newbie when it comes to jQuery. What is wrong with this line <li><a href="http://www.eliasentertainment.net/all-projects/#features" onclick="toSection('features');">FEATURES</a></li>
[04:40:56] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://pastebin.com/Lu3S9fYV
[04:41:19] <Cork> man... whats with all the inline event handlers today >_<
[04:41:39] <ParanoidGal> Sorry Cork!
[04:41:42] <Cork> wake up and get into the 21'st sentury
[04:42:02] <Damian_> ooh thats nifty http://jsfiddle.net/PCZcx/ larsemil, well nothing works, it does not rotate it only displays the first image
[04:42:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: That returns an object instead of the value of the textbox
[04:42:43] <Cork> ParanoidGal: inline event handlers has no reference to scope, so everything you use there has to be accessable from the global scope
[04:43:01] <humanite_> the first function makes a get request and gets back a xml file and should return the value of i18n_name, when i make a debug on i18n_name, i can see the value. But when i try to use the function in the second function below i get an "undefined"
[04:43:02] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: ya, cause your using the object in the function
[04:43:06] <Cork> i updated that one too
[04:43:38] <humanite_> please, can somebody help me to figure out what is wrong?
[04:44:12] <Damian_> seems like I'm not the only dumbfuck that does not get it :D
[04:44:44] <coppa> Any guy in Paris, if yes PM (on engage)
[04:45:09] <Cork> humanite_: ajax is async, you can't return values from it
[04:45:31] <Cork> humanite_: you need to use the callbacks instead
[04:45:36] <Cork> or defered
[04:45:40] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: Well, as I see it (and I'm far from a jquery wizard), link in that code becomes the span element where the text is, not the value of the text box. The function then tries to take the text object instead of a string that the user puts in the text box... probably got it wrong, but that's my thoughts...
[04:46:17] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: ah, true i switched the varaibles
[04:46:22] <humanite_> heya cork, thank you what would be the best way?
[04:47:35] <Cork> humanite_: add a callback variable like get_i18n(sp_kuerzel, callback) {} get_i18n(default_iso, function(name) { alet(name); });
[04:47:46] <cyb99> x.replace("/\\+/","&nbsp;") <- am i escaping + correctly?
[04:47:46] <Cork> *alert
[04:48:00] <Cork> no
[04:48:02] <cyb99> because it doesnt do anything
[04:48:09] <Cork> cyb99: /\\+/
[04:48:11] <Cork> no ""
[04:48:15] <cyb99> o ok
[04:48:26] <Cork> or just "+" if thats all you need
[04:48:34] <Cork> it doens't have to be regex
[04:48:41] <cyb99> how can i make it greedy ?
[04:48:49] <cyb99> eg, replace all + with &nbsp;
[04:49:15] <Cork> .replace(/\+/g, '&nbsp;');
[04:49:55] <cyb99> ah
[04:49:56] <cyb99> thank you
[04:50:03] <Cork> ?eval "0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8".replace(/\+/g, '&nbsp;');
[04:50:05] <bot-t> Cork: "0&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;5&nbsp;6&nbsp;7&nbsp;8"
[04:51:02] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: I am a real nOOb here... what am I supposed to do on the link variable to make the function work? Tried to switch span for input, but that didn't work... search.val()?
[04:51:44] <xec> cyb99: just a note, it's called "global" not "greedy"
[04:52:14] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Oh, of course it's the place where link is sent that needs changing, but I can't just use search there....
[04:52:37] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://jsfiddle.net/htkbG/
[04:52:47] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: but i'm not sure what function your talking about
[04:52:47] <cyb99> ok
[04:53:05] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: (and like i said, please use jsbin or jsfiddle
[04:53:16] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: it gives you live code and easier updates
[04:53:20] <D4> Cork, have you ever dealt with $.mobile.changePage() ? I'm trying to figure out how to initially hide a element, and on 'swipeleft' to basically move the "main" page to the left and only show the hidden content; Imagine a section and when you swipe the section you're taken to a new view more in-depth of that section :)
[04:53:44] <Cork> D4: never used jquery-mobile
[04:53:50] <Cork> i don't see the point
[04:53:53] <xec> cyb99: global means keep matching the entire regex while greedy means keep matching as much of a token as possible, sort of
[04:54:19] <wolfehr> hi guys, I'm trying to load test an ajax app, with lots of concurrent connections to see what response times are like. Any test suites that will allow me to do this (can't do it in a webpage as can't get multiple ajax requests executing simultaneously)
[04:54:24] <Nece228> hello ninja turtles
[04:54:31] <D4> cork good point, I'd guess the jQ version would be $.changePage() ?
[04:54:31] <Nece228> today we have a new challenge
[04:54:40] <Nece228> shredder is attacking us and we need to defend
[04:54:50] <larsemil> Damian_: you have som screwed up html :)
[04:54:51] <Nece228> so we need to call jquery function on html link
[04:55:06] <Cork> D4: no it would be $('body').load('new-url')
[04:55:08] <larsemil> Damian_: and you make it unnessecairly difficult
[04:55:11] <Cork> (guessing from the name)
[04:55:15] <cyb99> xec, so greedy repeats?
[04:55:25] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: It is still sending an object, I want it to send the string that the user types in the textbox to addProduct()
[04:55:26] <Damian_> larsemil: okay? o_o
[04:55:42] <D4> Cork ah okay, well the changePage also takes an object, not having to be a url or external file.. so I thought I could use it to display my hidden element solo. Thanks tho :)
[04:56:02] <Damian_> larsemil: maybe the tutorial I used was a bit outdated maybe
[04:56:03] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: it does, try clicking the link in jsfiddle
[04:56:45] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: its the function part in your string, that becomes object, cause i don't know what you intend to show there
[04:56:47] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok... I copy-pasted the code from your fiddle, and it keeps giving me [object Object] as value >.<
[04:57:30] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: i get => Funktion: [object Object]\nVÃ¤rde in: some value
[04:57:54] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: did you really test http://jsfiddle.net/htkbG/ ?
[04:58:20] <xec> ?eval "four mmmm's".match(/four m+/) @ cyb99
[04:58:20] <bot-t> cyb99: ["four mmmm"]
[04:58:26] <xec> ?eval "four mmmm's".match(/four m+?/) @ cyb99
[04:58:26] <bot-t> cyb99: ["four m"]
[04:58:42] <Cork> +? isn't valid js regex
[04:58:50] <xec> really?
[04:58:53] <Cork> ya
[04:58:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: Yes, and I'll be right back, need to check something totally unrelated in the code that might be messing things up....
[04:59:39] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: that link is working, you can type in the input field and the click the span
[05:00:10] <xec> Cork: so, you would need *?
[05:00:17] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: always talk about examples like that that can actually be fixed, it makes an enormus difference when ppl try to help
[05:00:25] <Cork> xec: that wouldn't work either
[05:00:53] <Cork> xec: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[05:01:03] <Cork> (this is what js engins implement)
[05:01:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: Yes, it was another part of my code that messed things up, your example worked fine
[05:01:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Thank you
[05:01:52] <xec> Cork: copypaste from that url: If used immediately after any of the quantifiers *, +, ?, or {}, makes the quantifier non-greedy (matching the minimum number of times), as opposed to the default, which is greedy (matching the maximum number of times).
[05:02:01] <xec> Cork: found next to the question mark (?)
[05:02:11] <Cork> hmm
[05:02:29] <Cork> weird... looked at that just a few days ago
[05:04:04] <Cork> ya, apperently it works O_o
[05:04:10] <Cork> wonder what i missed
[05:04:14] <xec> Cork: i will mark this day in my calendar as "that time Cork made a mistake" and celebrate every year, because this is a rare occasion"
[05:04:23] <xec> ;)
[05:04:31] <Damian_> lol
[05:04:45] <Cork> xec: we had a LOOONG discusion in a channel with a regex with non gready selectors
[05:04:48] <Cork> and it didn't work
[05:05:04] <xec> it seemed to do what i wanted in my contrived example at least
[05:05:08] <Cork> we ended up concluding that js engins doesn't support non gready selectors
[05:05:15] <Cork> but apperently it was something else :/
[05:05:24] <Cork> ya, it works for me too now >_>
[05:05:37] <Cork> (same browser and version)
[05:06:07] <xec> could have been some weird edge case perhaps?
[05:06:28] <Cork> or just a regex that was broken in a non obvius way
[05:06:45] <xec> sounds likely
[05:06:52] <Cork> never did try a minimalistic regex selector
[05:06:55] <Damian_> hmm seems larsemil died cause of my stupid script o.o^
[05:06:58] <frontendloader> is a jqXHR a promise?
[05:07:02] <larsemil> Damian_: hang on
[05:07:07] <Cork> frontendloader: yes
[05:07:13] <Damian_> lol ah ok sry
[05:07:30] <Cork> or rather its an object that has some promis objects part of it

[05:29:09] <Jon47> Nic0lt dude, do you really like metro?
[05:32:09] <aquatix> that link by Nic0lt tries to install a firefox addon :/
[05:33:55] <Jon47> even if it didn't, it's kind of bad form to pimp your site in an IRC channel that's not even realted to the topic
[05:34:15] <quicksilver> he's not pimping his site
[05:34:21] <quicksilver> he's installing his malware
[05:34:27] <quicksilver> and "he" is probably a bot
[05:37:12] <beancurd> meh. got kicked anyway :D
[05:40:00] <quicksilver> bit more than a kick.
[05:40:06] <quicksilver> freenode killed the connection.
[05:44:01] <ParanoidGal> Is there a simple way to make an anchored section background change when clicking on the corresponding link at the top
[05:44:40] <ParanoidGal> For example when people click on http://www.eliasentertainment.net/all-projects and click on Television / Books etc can it be made to scroll to that section and change the background colour?
[05:49:00] <mattyh88> doesn't console.log work in IE9?
[05:49:30] <Damian_> and I'm back
[05:50:17] <pachet> $(foo).on('click.mynamespace', function ( ) { var elem = $(this.href); $('body').animate({scrollTop : elem.css({backgroundColor : '#F00'}).offset().top }); });
[05:50:24] <pachet> ParanoidGal: something like that ^
[05:50:33] <pachet> might need to tweak the offset prop a bit
[05:50:52] <Cork> mattyh88: it does
[05:51:01] <Cork> opera is the only one without console.log
[05:54:35] <ParanoidGal> Thanks pachet you're a star. Just needed something to get me going!
[05:57:25] <mattyh88> hm ... i have this piece of code which works in chrome but doesn't in IE9: What could it be? It's driving me mad
[05:57:25] <mattyh88> https://gist.github.com/2398610
[05:59:45] <Cork> mattyh88: reproduce the code in jsfiddle
[05:59:59] <Cork> (with no php in it)
[06:00:31] <xec> the console.log("debug: " . data); looks funky, but it's commented out anyway
[06:01:09] <Cork> its commented out
[06:01:12] <Damian_> larsemil: hey you still around? sorry for the annoyance :(
[06:01:16] <Cork> hah ya :)
[06:01:43] <Cork> xec: looks half php to me
[06:01:49] <xec> ye
[06:03:38] <mattyh88> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/FvdQ9/
[06:04:01] <mattyh88> ow sorry have to delete the php
[06:04:20] <xec> and the <script> tags
[06:04:25] <Nece228> how to select specific character from some text?
[06:04:31] * Cork afk
[06:04:34] <xec> and choose jQuery as framework
[06:04:43] <Nece228> for instance i have a link, i want to select only one character from it
[06:04:52] <xec> Nece228: "select"? in what sense
[06:04:56] <Afflicto> $("#tabs")tabs( "select" , "#tabs-' .$selector .'" );   <- how can I do that if they are created in the future? (not yet in the DOM). I'm not sure how to do .on or .live.
[06:05:21] <mattyh88> xec, cork: http://jsfiddle.net/FvdQ9/1/
[06:05:27] <pachet> Nece228: >>'foobar'.match('b')?
[06:05:36] <xec> Afflicto: yoy a php coder too? :) you can't use . as concatenation, try +
[06:05:41] <xec> you*
[06:05:56] <Afflicto> xec: I am echoing it from php :P
[06:06:27] <pachet> Afflicto: you're going to have to get your hands dirty in JS, im afraid
[06:06:51] <pachet> the only surefire way is to call the $.tabs method on whatever elements you want in the callback of the ajax that you use to insert the elements dynamically
[06:06:54] <Nece228> xec: well i have this link http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/3?&, want to select only the number 3 from it and
[06:07:04] <Nece228> apply that number to a variable
[06:07:14] <xec> Afflicto: you're also missing a . in front of .tabs()
[06:07:20] <Nece228> pachet: thanks ill see
[06:07:30] <xec> Afflicto: but otherwise, just call .tabs() after the content exists
[06:08:33] <pachet> Nece228: var myInt = +'http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/3?&'.split('/').pop()[0];
[06:08:33] <xec> Nece228: is it always going to be that exact url followed by a number and a questionmark?
[06:08:54] <Nece228> xec: yes
[06:09:11] <Damian_> hey if anyone has time please help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/PCZcx/3/
[06:09:24] <EdwardIII> hrm, trying to use jQuery validate on a field with a colon on it but no joy: $('#billing\\:email').valid()
[06:09:38] <EdwardIII> when i do $('#billing\\:email').length i can see 1, so i know jQuery is finding the element. no errors in the console. any pointers?
[06:09:41] <Damian_> its a little image carusel with text and picture swapping and it does not animate
[06:10:32] <pachet> Damian_: passing strings to setTimeout is bad mojo
[06:10:54] <pachet> and since you're not passing any arguments into the fn, i dont really know why you're doing that anyway
[06:11:07] <pachet> just setInterval(rotate, 6000)
[06:11:12] <pachet> which still leaves the issue of it being out of scope
[06:11:52] <xec> ?eval "http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/3?&".match(/skelbiu.lt\/skelbimai\/([0-9]+)/)[1] @ Nece228
[06:11:53] <bot-t> Nece228: "3"
[06:12:08] <pachet> ugh
[06:13:15] <pachet> ?eval parseInt("http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/3?&".split('/').pop(), 10)
[06:13:15] <bot-t> pachet: 3
[06:13:51] <Nece228> xec: i dont understand
[06:13:58] <drakythe> Anyone have experience with using DOM changes as trigger's for events?
[06:14:05] <xec> pachet's is more elegant anyway
[06:14:49] <Nece228> well i confused you a bit
[06:14:53] <Nece228> the full link is actually this
[06:14:55] <EdwardIII> $('#billing\\:email').valid() # this is returning true, even though #billing:email is empty
[06:15:01] <Nece228> http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/3?&keywords=xbox&category_id=79&category_id=79&showAuctions=1&orderBy=1&search=1
[06:15:14] <drakythe> to wit: I have two sites, A and B. B is (partially) iframed into A. When a button is pressed on B, I need something to happen on A. (Don't ask, complicated situation above my paygrade :( )
[06:15:19] <pachet> Nece228: you still just want the first integer?
[06:15:25] <xec> Nece228: well it would still work
[06:15:28] <pachet> ^
[06:15:35] <pachet> the beauty of parseInt :[
[06:16:37] <Nece228> ok thanks, but all those .split('/').pop(), 10) look confusing to me
[06:16:40] <Nece228> need to examine
[06:16:51] <pachet> :[
[06:17:07] <xec> Nece228: i used a regex to match skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/(number) while pachet split the string on slashes, got the last one and ran parseInt on the result
[06:18:05] <Damian_> pachet: I'm a total noob, I did this with a tutorial so, what instead?
[06:18:17] <Nece228> ok let me see how it works...
[06:19:11] <EdwardIII> ah right, you need to have class="email" on email fields it seems
[06:21:15] <dschuett> Anyone mind taking a stab at why my datepicker defaultDate option isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/eQRqt/13/
[06:22:21] <crashev> hello how to convert object like var obj = $('<select />').append('<option>some</option>'). to html ?
[06:22:34] <EdwardIII> crashev: obj.html()?
[06:23:15] <crashev> obj.html() would return only options without select
[06:25:26] <crashev> ok, nvmd $('<div/>').append(obj).html() would do the trick ;]
[06:26:50] <Nece228> this thing isnt working probably because of my foult
[06:27:03] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Speaking of selects, I'm trying to make a switch to do something when a certain option is selected. switch($('#select').val()) seems to return the option selected and all options after that one... If I have 3 options and select number 2, then it returns 2 and 3. How do I fix this?
[06:27:03] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/7402369
[06:28:29] <Nece228> nevermind that i havent declared the variable
[06:38:07] <pachet> Damian_ : i gutted your example so you can start with the bare bones of what i think you want to do
[06:38:10] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/vuLnJ/
[06:38:48] <raj> it seems every jquery table plugin i've looked at wants to play with xml or json data. but I just want adjustable columns for a table that already exists in the html
[06:38:55] <raj> how can I do that?
[06:39:46] <raj> in fact, I do change the table html (adding/removing rows) using ajax callbacks, but I want the plugin to work with the html data within the #mytable
[06:39:49] <karisma> Excel-style ones where you can change the width?
[06:39:49] <raj> is htis possible?
[06:39:50] <raj> *this
[06:39:55] <raj> exactly
[06:40:46] <dschuett> Why isn't maxDate working in my datepicker? http://jsfiddle.net/eQRqt/25/
[06:41:04] <raj> any ideas karisma ?
[06:41:21] <anli_> How do I get the position of a <li>?
[06:42:19] <nFFF> ?index
[06:42:19] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:42:41] <raj> ?position

[06:42:46] <raj> anli_, ^^

[06:43:04] <Trisox> no no .. :|
[06:43:09] <karisma> @raj -> I thing google docs does it using a hidden column + a drag handler. I'm not aware of any libraries out there that do this.
[06:43:39] <raj> hidden column?
[06:43:44] <raj> how's that help?
[06:43:55] <pachet> gives you something to drag?
[06:43:59] <karisma> Yes.
[06:45:19] <karisma> By hidden, I mean that is has something like: each td has colspan=2 in each row, except in the top one, where it is draggable when hovered over.
[06:46:07] <tocka> Is it possible to do that only one part of a page would be printed, lets say a page pops up in a lightbox and only the contents of the light box would be printed?
[06:46:08] <raj> not exactly sure how that would help though
[06:46:17] <raj> nFFF, do you know of such a plugin?
[06:46:25] <tocka> Would jQuery be able to do such kind of a thing?
[06:46:26] <raj> do give excel style draggable columns (for resizing)

[06:48:13] <Damian_> pachet: thanks a ton!!
[06:48:18] <EdwardIII> hrm, i'm dropping an iframe in to trigger a download. works great in chrome, doesn't work at all in ie heh: $('body').append('<iframe width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" src="' + btn.data('url') + '"></iframe>');
[06:48:28] <EdwardIII> no warnings, naffing
[06:50:01] <xec> "trigger a download"? like, you want a save file.. popup thing?
[06:50:38] <EdwardIII> xec: yeah, like clicking a href to a file
[06:52:28] <xec> i don't actually have an answer, was just curious :D
[06:52:38] <Leviatn_> if you have control to the way the file is served from the server
[06:52:38] <johnkpaul> ?g content disposition browser
[06:52:40] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Using Content-Disposition header - forcing SaveAs in browsers ... - http://www.jtricks.com/bits/content_disposition.html
[06:52:44] <johnkpaul> @EdwardIII
[06:52:45] <xec> have you tried stuff like window.open ?
[06:52:45] <Leviatn_> you can set the content disposition headers to achieve that
[06:53:04] <EdwardIII> well it's not so much that
[06:53:22] <EdwardIII> actually i guess i could just use document.location.href='/file.pdf'
[06:53:53] <xec> yeah, but that would make you leave the current page?
[06:53:55] <EdwardIII> it's just, this solution works nicely in real web browsers, just not in a certain internet explorer
[06:54:02] <EdwardIII> xec: that's what my thought was...
[06:54:10] <EdwardIII> *actually*, ie is probably loading the PDF inside the iframe, isn't it?
[06:54:21] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: yes, that's what the content dispotion header is for
[06:56:01] <frontendloader> is jshint just blowing smoke about semicolons? I was under the impression they weren't needed ever
[06:56:58] <johnkpaul> frontendloader: it's an option you can configure
[06:57:06] <xec> frontendloader: always using semicolons means happy sunshine and rainbows without rain!
[06:57:11] <johnkpaul> I'm not going to share an opinion, but yes in some cases they are needed
[06:57:20] <xec> i speak the truth
[06:57:28] <johnkpaul> ?g jshint options
[06:57:30] <bot-t> johnkpaul, JSHint Options - http://www.jshint.com/options/
[07:00:01] <nFFF> never seen so much fuss about a semi colon :D
[07:00:19] <xec> more fuss incoming
[07:00:31] <xec> frontendloader: more often than not, semicolons are not needed, but in some cases they are. so if you always use them there is no ambiguity. if you don't like semicolons cluttering your code, maybe look at coffeescript?
[07:01:26] <Gottaname> Need to clarify some issues. I'm trying to make an ajax call to a json file. If I don't add in the dataType: "json", the json file isn't hit, but if I remove the dataType option it works fine. Anyone knowes what could be going wrong and if the dataType is a necessity to declare?
[07:01:42] <frontendloader> is there any situation where you need a semicolon that isn't cramming things on to one line?
[07:02:30] <johnkpaul> frontendloader: yes
[07:02:49] <johnkpaul> they are fairly rare, but the situation exists
[07:03:33] <nFFF> the whole situation thats arised though is becuase crookford is imposing a style, not just pure ecmascript
[07:03:38] <nFFF> which i why everyones divided
[07:04:03] <xec> hehe, "crook"ford
[07:04:14] <johnkpaul> eh, this argument has been going for much much longer than yesterday
[07:04:27] <xec> not that "crock" is much better though
[07:04:48] <johnkpaul> Gottaname: dataType json should just be parsing the request as json
[07:05:04] <johnkpaul> and handig the successhandler a object
[07:05:20] <Gottaname> so its not responsible for sending a request?
[07:05:43] <anli_> Is there a shortcut for getting the screen position of an element using jquery?
[07:05:43] <johnkpaul> I believe that the same request is sent
[07:05:45] <Gottaname> also, assuming my json file is using php json_encoding, will the ajax call still detect it as json?
[07:06:05] <johnkpaul> Gottaname: no
[07:06:10] <johnkpaul> that depends on the content type header
[07:06:17] <johnkpaul> echo json_encode in php does not set the header
[07:06:24] <johnkpaul> anli_: screen position? thatcan mean a fiew different things
[07:06:26] <pachet> ?.offset @ anli_
[07:06:26] <bot-t> anli_, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:06:44] <pachet> but then you'll have to extrapolate 'screen position' based on window size
[07:06:54] <pachet> and scroll position :[
[07:07:16] <Gottaname> johnkpaul, any good method of troubleshooting sending and recieveing of ajax requests, kinda new and kind of lost
[07:07:30] <pachet> Gottaname: firebug or web console
[07:07:40] <anli_> Would make sense if .postition and .offset switched names
[07:07:44] <frontendloader> chrome's debugging stuff is excellent.
[07:07:50] <Gottaname> any quickstart firebug guide to this, or I need to google harder?
[07:08:09] <pachet> ?g firebug basics
[07:08:10] <bot-t> pachet, Firebug Tutorial: Introduction to Firebug :: CSS, JavaScript and ... - http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/06/introduction-to-firebug/
[07:08:19] <Gottaname> that works
[07:08:20] <Gottaname> thanks
[07:08:31] <anli_> As it is now, you use .offset to get a position and .position to get an offset
[07:10:00] <Gottaname> oops, a last question. If there any benefit in using json format or whatever is default like html or text?
[07:10:24] <Gottaname> as in security, performance or best practices
[07:10:29] <johnkpaul> json is the best practice
[07:10:32] <pachet> easier to communicate datasets
[07:10:41] <pachet> modern browsers have builtin json parsers
[07:12:56] <dschuett> Anyone willing to take a look at why my maxDate option isn't working in my datepicker? http://jsfiddle.net/eQRqt/30/
[07:13:40] <pachet> anli_: i disagree
[07:13:50] <pachet> when you look at the mechanics of how $(foo).position() works
[07:14:13] <pachet> it calculates the element's position relative to the first ancestor with an effective css position of 'relative'
[07:14:28] <pachet> so naming that method 'position' correlates directly to a css property of the same name
[07:14:32] <Nece228> pachet: well, is this line valid?: hahsa = $(this).match(/skelbiu.lt\/skelbimai\/([0-9]+)/)[0];
[07:16:03] <pachet> Nece228: not unless .toString on $(this) yields a string where that would return a match
[07:16:20] <pachet> which in your case, i'm sure it doesnt
[07:16:30] <Nece228> well i tried your methods
[07:16:34] <Nece228> they doesnt seem to work
[07:16:45] <pachet> you doesn't seem to be calling them on the right object
[07:17:00] <Nece228> yeah
[07:17:02] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/93424723
[07:17:05] <Nece228> thats the code btw
[07:17:26] <Nece228> need to find a fix, because now i get error that im calling match on an object
[07:18:43] <EdwardIII> hey, when i try and eval() this json i get a syntax error: {"firstname":"test","lastname":"man","email":"edward@example.com"}
[07:18:44] <Sonderblade> anyone know of a jquery library that can render graphs (graphviz graphs) that are zoomable and panable like google maps?
[07:18:52] <pachet> Nece228: https://gist.github.com/2399105
[07:19:05] <pachet> Nece228: document.write is more 1999 than the matrix
[07:19:05] <EdwardIII> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[07:19:11] <EdwardIII> looks pretty sexy to me
[07:19:27] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: that's considered a block when you just eval it
[07:19:40] <johnkpaul> you need to add "var obj = "
[07:19:44] <johnkpaul> or rather than that, use JSON.parse
[07:19:49] <johnkpaul> or jQuery.parseJSON
[07:19:52] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON
[07:19:53] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[07:20:23] <EdwardIII> JSON.parse is the one fo rme, thanks
[07:21:12] <johnkpaul> JSON.parse is only natively available on >=IE8
[07:21:15] <johnkpaul> in case it matters
[07:22:55] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i'm all about the JSON2.js
[07:23:04] <EdwardIII> and sadly, it does, heh
[07:23:26] <johnkpaul> great
[07:23:44] <johnkpaul> great in that you have a solution, not in that you have to support <ie8
[07:23:52] <EdwardIII> haha yeah
[07:24:04] <Parhs> hello guys.. what is the best way to call page specific javascript ?
[07:24:28] <pachet> Parhs: 'foo()'
[07:25:33] <Parhs> having a large js file with a function for each page you mean ?
[07:26:17] <pachet> it was kind of a sarcastic answer, i guess i didnt understand the question
[07:26:39] <Nece228> pachet: thanks its working
[07:27:03] <pachet> Nece228: i accept beer payments in #js
[07:27:24] <pachet> Parhs: you want to do conditional logic based on the current url?
[07:27:35] <EdwardIII> maybe he needs backbone.js and a router?
[07:27:37] <pachet> because normally i just have my server spit out the script tags i need...
[07:27:42] <pachet> possibly
[07:28:25] <Nece228> pachet: but isnt a polite and nice "thanks" better than million dollars?
[07:28:41] <EdwardIII> better both
[07:28:56] <Nece228> so i guess when i said thanks i gave you already more than million dollars
[07:29:02] <Parhs> yes pachet something like this
[07:30:16] <gob> is there an equivalent of $('#somthing').get(0) that returns the jquery wrapped object?
[07:30:23] <pachet> Nece228: oh i wasnt actually asking for money
[07:30:57] <Nece228> pachet: mind i ask why you used $('blah').on('click.myname') instead of $('blah').click?
[07:31:15] <pachet> because that way you can unbind that event specifically
[07:31:23] <pachet> $(blah).off('click.mynamespace')
[07:31:49] <Nece228> pachet: oh, thanks for explanation
[07:31:50] <pachet> rather than $(blah).off('click') <--if you had any other clicks bound = oopsies
[07:32:46] <Nece228> pachet: you seem to know much
[07:33:33] <Nece228> pachet: so i guess you dont need money because already web developers have more money than presidents
[07:34:00] <pachet> i was just voicing my beer thirst
[07:34:08] <pachet> 9:30 on a monday, you know :[
[07:34:11] <Nece228> if only i wouldnt struggle to find a job like that, but nobody wants me
[07:34:41] <Nece228> pachet: thats definitely sad, its only 5:37 where i live
[07:34:56] <pachet> oh weird
[07:35:07] <pachet> i didnt think there were hours before 7AM
[07:35:26] <pabloz> hey guys, I need a reminder, what's the best option for checking that some variable is not null? foo != null? foo !== null?, ...?
[07:35:36] <Nece228> sometimes in a summer i go to sleep when i see dawn
[07:36:01] <Nece228> im like hobo right now, eating one time per day and trying to learn this stuff to get a job
[07:37:00] <pachet> pabloz : foo!==null
[07:38:31] <Nece228> pachet: your from usa?
[07:39:21] <pabloz> pachet, thanks. Now the tough question: why?
[07:39:53] <pachet> because you have to do strict equivalence to prevent catching false positives when the variable value is coercible
[07:40:03] <pachet> var foo = false; foo == null //true
[07:40:39] <pachet> Nece228: after a fashion
[07:40:52] <pabloz> ok, that was not the case, though
[07:41:23] <pabloz> may I risk that "strict is cheaper than loose"?
[07:43:27] <pachet> cheaper?
[07:43:32] <pachet> from the engine's perspective?
[07:43:42] <Jon47> maybe cheap in terms of headaches it could conceivably cause.. i don't think there is any practical difference in terms of blocking time..
[07:43:45] <pabloz> yeap
[07:44:19] <pabloz> btw:   false != null at least in FF
[07:44:35] <pachet> there's actually a slight optimization for coercive equivalence in most browsers when it comes to ints
[07:45:05] <pachet> but that has more to do with nanboxing and smi heap avoidance than actual comp
[07:45:11] <pachet> for any two heap values, strict is cheaper
[07:45:22] <pachet> but it would be extremely marginal
[07:45:41] <pabloz> of course, and I'd never choose based on that (FWIW)
[07:46:45] <pabloz> most of the examples I found used != (or ==), that's why I asked
[07:46:53] <pachet> pabloz: my bad, false!=null. i was thinking of undefined :[
[07:46:59] <pachet> which itself equates to false, to add to the confusion
[07:47:22] <Jon47> http://jsperf.com/strict-vs-coercive
[07:47:33] <pachet> ?eval var foo=null; foo==undefined
[07:47:33] <pabloz> checking
[07:47:36] <bot-t> pachet: true
[07:48:05] <pabloz> argh
[07:48:08] <shomon> hi
[07:48:12] <Jon47> pachet yep you were right, when it comes to ints, coercive is slightly faster (in chrome at least)
[07:50:17] <shomon> is it possible to close one menu when another is clicked?
[07:51:25] <pabloz> Jon47: not in FF (also seems slower)
[07:51:27] <tapas> hi, i'm trying to implement a very simple browser extension for IE. there's a way to add a context menu entry with just a few registry entries and a html file on the local disc..
[07:51:39] <tapas> http://pastesite.com/34483
[07:52:08] <tapas> sadly all my attempts to do an ajax call from this html file fail..
[07:52:32] <tapas> unless i add a script element to the body of the document loaded in IE (see the commented out last lines)
[07:52:37] <tapas> i'm totally puzzled and quite lost :D
[07:52:52] <Jon47> actully i ran it again in chrome a few more times, they are just neck and neck
[07:53:25] <tapas> maybe i'm missing something fundamental..
[07:56:17] <fbernier> Hi, I'm doing an ajax request which sometimes return a 503 http status code. I am handling this, but is it possible not to show the error in the console?
[08:11:04] <vladyn> have a stupid question: I have $.each(slides, function (key, value) {â€¦.}
[08:11:12] <vladyn> in this loop what is value
[08:11:26] <vladyn> and what is the diff between value and $(this) ?
[08:11:32] <coppa> slides[key] = value
[08:11:47] <jwg2s> hey all, having a problem with jquery animate. http://24.125.42.135/ click signup, form drops down.  but when clicking hide it won't go all the back to 0 height
[08:12:14] <vladyn> for value I'm getting object htmlElem
[08:12:26] <vladyn> but I can not apply any functin to it
[08:12:28] <johnkpaul> vladyn: slides[key] === value, but $(this) is the jquery object
[08:12:33] <vladyn> like find()
[08:12:41] <vladyn> oh
[08:12:44] <vladyn> I see now
[08:12:50] <pachet> vladyn: the value is the same as 'this' within the fn
[08:12:51] <coppa> ah if you deal with jquery objects just do slides.each(function({}) then
[08:13:00] <pachet> the problem comes when you're using $.each over an array of strings, etc
[08:13:02] <vladyn> that is the reason that any jq function doesn't work to value
[08:13:18] <johnkpaul> vladyn: value is the bare dom element, unaffected by jquery
[08:13:25] <jwg2s> coppa: are you talking to me?
[08:13:33] <vladyn> well this make sense
[08:13:35] <johnkpaul> 'this' is also the bare dom element, unaffected by jquery
[08:13:47] <coppa> jwg2s: was talking to vladyn
[08:13:48] <johnkpaul> $(this) == $(value)
[08:13:54] <johnkpaul> and they are both jquery objects
[08:14:04] <jwg2s> coppa: ah ok, when you're done helping him do you mind checking mine out? http://24.125.42.135/
[08:14:08] <jwg2s> coppa: would greatly appreciate it
[08:14:14] <vladyn> in fact really great explanation for newbies like me
[08:14:33] <vladyn> johnkpaul: many thanks
[08:14:43] <johnkpaul> no problem, vladyn, have fun!
[08:15:55] <vladyn> coppa:
[08:15:55] <vladyn> patchet: thanks a lot !
[08:17:49] <coppa> jwg2s: your problem is that your hide button has the class panel_button
[08:18:01] <coppa> this button this has two orders on click event
[08:20:03] <jwg2s> coppa: hm ok, let's see if i can fix that
[08:21:28] <Gates> When you echo PHP into javascript you don't need to use json? (or is that backwards?)
[08:24:28] <ilian> Hi, I am having some problems with jQuery tooltip, my tooltips appear out of the viewport any ideas what my cause this?
[08:24:52] <coppa> element is not visible ?
[08:24:57] <coppa> ilian:
[08:25:53] <ilian> coppa, the scroll extends and probably the element show up somewhere of the the current viewport
[08:25:56] <jwg2s> coppa: still struggling, how can i switch the hide button to animate to 0px height?
[08:26:01] <Parhs> hello guys.. which is an efficient way to have a "document ready" function for each page without writing javascript inside html file,only with external ?
[08:26:14] <Parhs>  the problem is that external file would be used by many pages
[08:26:28] <Parhs> having a tag at body or script ? checking url? , or calling only an inline function within html page?
[08:26:46] <johnkpaul> Parhs: your external script can add a function to document.ready
[08:26:54] <johnkpaul> it doesn't have to be in script tags inside the html
[08:27:37] <Parhs> yes but when the same file is going to be included at many pages then it wont be page specific
[08:28:01] <coppa> jwg2s: you can change the html or you can modify only the js ?
[08:28:40] <johnkpaul> Parhs: so you include the script tag on multiple pages?
[08:29:25] <hahnsolo> I am having an issue calling a function on ajax complete.  It loads perfectly on the document  initial load. I need to load for the new items that is loaded from ajax.  I am implementing a rateit plugin , I put the plugin in a function
[08:30:22] <Parhs> yes
[08:30:42] <Tasser> is it possible to set a timeout and be able to change the remaning time later on?
[08:32:01] <ilian> coppa, it shows on the bottom of the page
[08:32:43] <pachet> Tasser: not natively
[08:33:04] <pachet> you could write something up to do it though
[08:33:55] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @hahnsolo
[08:33:56] <bot-t> hahnsolo, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[08:34:10] <littulb> Question .... does ANYBODY know of a plugin (other than JQprint and AreaPrint) that will allow me to print a certain container/section of a website???
[08:34:21] <johnkpaul> Parhs: so I am confused about your question, if you can include a script tag taht links to a particular js file, that's how you can make it not page specific
[08:34:38] <littulb> Or if anyone know the trick on how to quickly write the code... It would be GREATLY appreciated
[08:35:08] <littulb> The problems with JQprint and Print area is that the code does now allow the print to be rendered the correct way in IE
[08:35:09] <hahnsolo> I dont think it can be fiddled the data is using a repeater and pulling from twitter
[08:35:12] <littulb> bummer
[08:36:15] <coppa> ilian: maybe you did not includ ethe css of the plugin
[08:36:25] <littulb> is the trick to print area with jquery creating the area in an iframe??
[08:36:32] <chilversc_> anyone know of debugging tools for IE9 mobile?
[08:36:42] <littulb> ilian: the ethe??
[08:36:58] <coppa> include the
[08:37:17] <littulb> coppa: the what?
[08:37:24] <ilian> littulb, ?
[08:37:37] <ilian> I've included it
[08:37:55] <coppa> can't help you without link sorry
[08:38:21] <littulb> ilian: were you referring to the question I asked about printing area?
[08:39:15] <ilian> littulb, no, different conversation
[08:39:49] <ilian> coppa, the problem was bad selector, but is it normal for my scrollers to change on tooltip popup?
[08:40:25] <littulb> ilian: oh ok... sorry
[08:40:51] <littulb> v
[08:40:56] <littulb> Question .... does ANYBODY know of a plugin (other than JQprint and AreaPrint) that will allow me to print a certain container/section of a website???
[08:49:04] <coppa> ilian: no idea i never used this plugin :\
[08:53:29] <coin3d> hi there, i want to do some table calculation - for each table row (tr class="article") i want to calculate the whole price consisting of an amount (td class="amount") and a price (td class="price") of an article, however i dont get it managed to calculate only a SINGLE ROW - every time i type a number, the calculation calculates the same value for the other articles as well. here is my code: http://pastebin.com/KvjTWkut
[08:59:21] <ArexBawrin> I can't get this image to work with fadeToggle when I click the button above it. http://jsfiddle.net/RP6WP/
[09:01:51] <Parhs> hello guys.. if i keep all my javascript in external file then how is it possible to have page specific javascript? Where it should start?
[09:03:11] <Sonderblade> Parhs: you can include a different file on each page
[09:03:48] <Tasser> is it possible to select stuff based on data attributes or are id/class the only available selectors?
[09:04:14] <xec> ArexBawrin: check your console for errors
[09:04:23] <xec> ArexBawrin: you're missing a $ sign
[09:04:27] <Eviltwin> Tasser: You can select by attribute
[09:04:36] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[09:05:12] <ArexBawrin> xec: yes, thank you. Noob question but how can i check for errors in the console? (I have firebug if that helps...)
[09:05:33] <xec> ArexBawrin: just upen firebug and click the console tab, then refresh the page ;)
[09:05:34] <xmaddness> ArexBawrin, In firebug, the console
[09:05:43] <xmaddness> They'll show there
[09:06:18] <ArexBawrin> thank you:)
[09:08:59] <Afflicto> I have a jquery script that uses document.on() to enable\disable something in my CMS. It lets you "toggle" permissions on and off, for groups. the post requests work but it doesn't change the state of the image\buttons. here's the code: http://pastebin.com/NHGJPDDh
[09:13:35] <DanyWalker> hi guys
[09:13:56] <DanyWalker> i have a question... i'm trying show a map in mi page, but is not possible
[09:14:08] <Wolf_22> Is this the correct way to make a basic call using "animate()" on a DIV to change its height of percentage-based units?
[09:14:10] <Wolf_22> $("#blah").animate({height:65+"%" },1500);
[09:14:38] <rethus> how can i check on this example only dokumente-checkbox or fotos: checkbox... evenb if they are encapsulate in same form-tag?  http://jsfiddle.net/pUZkM/
[09:15:01] <DanyWalker> in this case, i can''t see the map : http://www.supportperu.com/mapa/index.html
[09:15:41] <DanyWalker> but if i load without ajax, its load normally http://www.supportperu.com/mapa/mapa.html
[09:15:50] <rethus> i think it should work over the id from the table, which encapulate ech aof them, right?
[09:22:35] <DEADB33F> Is there any penalty for setting an elements width to the value it's currently set at?
[09:24:29] <DEADB33F> EG. I have say 200 elements, 190 of which are set at 100px width, the rest at 50px. I want them all set to 100px width. Will I be better of filtering just the ones which need changing or setting the width on all of them to 100?
[09:27:33] <quicksilver> DEADB33F: I expect just setting them is no slower than checking and maybe setting them.
[09:27:54] <quicksilver> DEADB33F: they're all very fast - if you're doing so many elements that the delay is noticeable then try both and see which is faster :)
[09:41:45] <jwg2s> having an issue with a sign-in bar.  24.125.42.135
[09:42:04] <jwg2s> http://24.125.42.135/ sorry, click sign in, bar comes down.  click hide, bar hides.
[09:42:12] <jwg2s> however, trying to drop it down a second time will not drop down
[09:42:51] <jwg2s> any help would be greatly appreciated
[09:43:47] <jwg2s> seems to be the delay.queue that is breaking it...
[09:44:46] <Cork[home]> you've fixed it?
[09:44:59] <jwg2s> nope, just identified that that is what is breaking it
[09:45:03] <jwg2s> but i can't seem to figure out why
[09:45:13] <Cork[home]> what browser do you have problem in?
[09:45:17] <Cork[home]> it works fine here
[09:45:18] <jwg2s> chrome and firefox
[09:46:03] <Cork[home]> hmm can repro in chromium though
[09:46:14] <jwg2s> try again
[09:46:33] <Cork[home]> ya, a reload broke ff again
[09:46:36] <jwg2s> when trying to set #panel height: 75px it fails
[09:47:03] <jwg2s> only second time through, when i remove the delay(50) from the set border to none it works again, but doesn't look as good
[09:49:26] <Cork[home]> jwg2s: $('div.panel') vs $("div#panel")
[09:49:32] <Cork[home]> i think thats the problem
[09:50:34] <jwg2s> no luck
[09:50:46] <jwg2s> does " vs ' matter?
[09:50:51] <Cork[home]> jwg2s: best would prob to cache those selectors in a variable instead of resolving them each loop
[09:50:53] <Cork[home]> no
[09:51:20] <jwg2s> so have two different styles in css?
[09:51:37] <Cork[home]> wait a min
[09:51:50] <Cork[home]> your adding a queue but you never trigger it
[09:52:13] <jwg2s> how do you queue, i thought they delay triggered it
[09:52:32] <Cork[home]> not garanteed
[09:52:44] <Cork[home]> hmm, need to test this a bit
[09:53:31] <jwg2s> http://blog.project-sierra.de/archives/1559
[09:53:39] <jwg2s> don't think i implemented this appropriately
[09:54:06] <sphinxxx> jwg2s: i don't think delay will work like that
[09:54:17] <sphinxxx> you can delay an animation but not the changing of a css property, you have to use setTimeout for that
[09:54:24] <jwg2s> ah ok
[09:54:30] <Cork[home]> no you don't
[09:54:36] <Cork[home]> the queue is correct
[09:55:01] <Cork[home]> you can't just slapp css changes on the selector, but if you add them to the queue it works fine
[09:55:37] <sphinxxx> i think the code is more complex than it needs to be
[09:56:16] <jwg2s> yeah i just want to change the border style at the appropriate time, after the slider bar has gone up
[09:59:12] <Cork[home]> jwg2s: could you try changing line 75 to $('div#panel') ?
[09:59:24] <Cork[home]> (btw no need for div infront of an id)
[09:59:57] <jwg2s> nope
[09:59:59] <jwg2s> ah ok
[10:01:12] <jwg2s> got it
[10:01:32] <jwg2s> needed $(this).dequeue at the end of my queue
[10:01:45] * Cork[home] nods
[10:01:53] <jwg2s> Cork[home]: thanks for the help :)

[10:30:28] <shoky> ;D
[10:30:43] <raj> not even sure it does what he asked
[10:30:53] <shoky> still no idea what he really wants ;>
[10:31:23] <raj> lol
[10:33:01] <Guevara> hi! i have 20 select's in html and put a class='setor_select', all selects have this class, i need get the value of the select is change $('.setor_select').change(function() work only with the first select
[10:33:15] <Tasser> http://jsfiddle.net/7UTUv/ how do I select that div based on data-posx ?
[10:33:30] <shoky> Guevara are the other selects added dynamically after the page is already loaded ?
[10:33:47] <shoky> hm
[10:33:48] <Eviltwin> Tasser: That is invalid syntax in your HTML
[10:34:06] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/7UTUv/1/
[10:34:11] <partX> For better demonstration, see this plz http://i44.tinypic.com/1e5pgl.png
[10:34:11] <Guevara> yes, are dinamic with jquery shoky, click in "add" and add a row with select
[10:34:31] <shoky> Guevara then you should read about event delegation. see ?on
[10:34:31] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:35:05] <Guevara> ok, i read, thanks shoky
[10:35:13] <Tasser> Eviltwin, oups
[10:35:25] <shoky> in short you wanna delegate the event to some container element (that contains all the selects)
[10:36:10] <shoky> partX yeah, jquery's not for that
[10:36:17] <shoky> if it really is just an image file
[10:37:20] <partX_> sorry internet was gone for a while.Guys,this is what I want.
[10:37:22] <partX_> http://i44.tinypic.com/1e5pgl.png
[10:37:32] <shoky> [20:36:10] <shoky> partX yeah, jquery's not for that
[10:37:33] <shoky> [20:36:17] <shoky> if it really is just an image file
[10:37:39] <Eviltwin> Tasser: That wasn't really an "oops"-sized mistake
[10:37:43] <Eviltwin> That was just completely wrong
[10:38:07] <Mikeh810> What is $( data )?
[10:38:11] <partX_> shoky, can you point me a direction?
[10:38:23] <Mikeh810> is that the results of an ajax request?
[10:38:29] <shoky> partX_ not really, sorry.. its not a trivial thing to do
[10:38:41] <shoky> and you didnt really specify anything
[10:38:47] <Guevara> shoky: i trying this $('.setor_select').on("change", function(event), work with change action?
[10:39:01] <shoky> like.. how is the program supposed to know that what you want is 'that yellow circle in the middle'
[10:39:21] <partX_> May be OpenGL could do it.I have need to look up perhaps
[10:39:32] <shoky> Guevara: no that would end in the same result you had before
[10:40:14] <shoky> Guevara you can try: $(document).on("change", '.setor_select', function(event){...} );
[10:40:15] <klocatelli> if the circle and rectangle have unique and constant colors, it would be semi-trivial to do.... just march from left to right
[10:40:26] <klocatelli> or right left, or up down or down up :P
[10:40:31] <shoky> Guevara but you should really spend more time reading about .on and the different ways to use it
[10:40:40] <g0rd0n> $('.chanbutton').live('click', function(event) { alert($(this).parent().parent().id); <- if .chanbutton is inside a <td>, isnt that alert supposed to get me the id of the <tr> element? i'm getting undefined :(
[10:40:46] <klocatelli> but if you have multiple rectangles or multiple objects with the same color... not so trivial
[10:40:51] <Guevara> ok
[10:40:59] <Mikeh810> In the pastebin ( http://pastebin.com/0YeigQSf ), I am trying to submit a simple form via ajax. The form gets submitted and processed correct. However, the php script returns a string I would like displayed in a div (with the id of #result)
[10:41:09] <shoky> partX_ OpenGL is not really for processing images either ;)
[10:41:26] <shoky> don't think you wanna go down that path really ;)
[10:41:35] <klocatelli> @ partX
[10:41:42] <rethus> why i got : Cannot call method 'click' of null here? http://jsfiddle.net/pUZkM/5/
[10:41:46] <rethus> the id exists
[10:42:04] <shoky> you didnt choose jquery
[10:42:06] <shoky> on the left.
[10:42:22] <shoky> @ rethus
[10:42:39] <partX> is there somekinda c++ or c# library to do that.It is very important to me.
[10:42:59] <rethus> :) oh what a blame
[10:43:14] <pabloz> is it possible to bind custom events to the node being created? I mean: $('<div/>', {"pjax:start": function(){do_that();}}). Currently I'm getting a node attribute "pjax:start". Really...
[10:43:15] <klocatelli> partX this is not a trivial problem, even if there is a library you will need to do a *lot* of work to do what you want
[10:43:20] <shoky> tons probably. but.. you'd have to learn how to use them. i'm sure then dont have methods such as   'findSingleYellowCircle'
[10:43:25] <shoky> @ partX
[10:43:27] <Guevara> thanks for help shoky
[10:43:34] <shoky> Guevara np
[10:43:35] <klocatelli> there is no pre-packaged solution for even simple recognition algorithms ^_^
[10:44:10] <klocatelli> but again, depending on your exact requirements you might have a very very simple alternative like marching across the image and checking colors
[10:44:12] <partX> how do face detection program work then?
[10:44:20] <shoky> hah
[10:44:23] <shoky> they are pretty complex
[10:44:27] <partX> oo
[10:44:27] <klocatelli> partX, thousands and thousands of LoC :P
[10:44:41] <shoky> if you thought jquery was for image processing......... i think you should stay away from face detection ;p
[10:45:05] <shoky> at least for the time being
[10:45:11] <klocatelli> although face detection is very different from your requirements...
[10:45:49] <klocatelli> yet again, you should really provide more detail as your problem could be far simpler than you're making it
[10:46:39] <partX> Think of this then. Only single UNIQUE color for each geometry.Now can I get lenght of that geometry?
[10:46:59] <shoky> g0rd0n try .parent().parent().get(0).id  or .parent().parent().attr('id')    or something wholly different altogether.
[10:47:01] <klocatelli> yes, and I already told you how
[10:48:13] <partX> no no.all of the unique colored geometry is in sangle image file say named "panview.jpeg".
[10:48:24] <shoky> pabloz: $('<div/>').on('someevent',......)
[10:48:27] <klocatelli> yes. And I told you how.
[10:48:34] <klocatelli> do I need to spell it out for you?
[10:50:53] <pabloz> shoky: yes, but binding in the constructor works for regular events, this means I can't get the same for custom events?
[10:51:19] <g0rd0n> shoky: thanks, works now :)
[10:51:30] <wroos> How do I toggle a id?
[10:51:32] <pabloz> shoky: (btw) thanks for answering
[10:53:56] <acodispo> Hello. I have a click() handler which targets elements with certain CSS class. When I load some content via AJAX, the click() responds to elements with that class outside the AJAX, but not within. Is there some way to get around this?
[10:54:26] <partX> it was internet again.
[10:54:50] <px12> hey guys, here's a temp link of a website i'm working on, could someone help me with this 'slow' thing? i mean.. http://blog.crister.tk/web/alphainside/index_new.htm go to the 'Events' section in this and try opening all the event details one by one, you'll notice it gets slower after each click.. i mean after seeing 6-7 details if you see others or see whatever you had seen earlier.. just open details more than 6 7 time.. then the load time will get slower.. c
[10:54:51] <px12> ould someone help me with it? whole js is on the page itself right now.
[10:55:02] <rethus> how can i typecast a variable into bolean?
[10:55:07] <rethus> (bbol) var ?
[10:55:23] <klocatelli> I think !!var
[10:55:23] <shoky> pabloz: i donno if you can do that for custom events
[10:55:36] <wroos> Anyone?
[10:55:47] <shoky> what do you mean toggle a id?
[10:56:00] <klocatelli> partX, ya get it?
[10:56:06] <rethus> !!var does a typecast, or a result like if(var==1) ?
[10:56:13] <partX> klocatelli,sorry dude.I think I really did not understand.
[10:56:52] <wroos> shoky: Instead of toggeling a class i need to toggle the id attribute.
[10:57:05] <shoky> rethus it'll give you a boolean
[10:57:06] <klocatelli> rethus, it effectively becomes a bool
[10:57:27] <rethus> thankx
[10:57:29] <shoky> wroos, you want the element to have an id, and then not have one?
[10:57:31] <px12> wroos: how do you intend to select the element of which you need to 'toggle' the id? o.O
[10:57:34] <rethus> wonder why there is no typecast in js
[10:57:53] <klocatelli> partX, well it depends on your exact requirements still. If you have one object of each color you can just scan across the image comparing pixel colors (after getting the raw image data through canvas)
[10:57:54] <rethus> means like in php
[10:58:06] <Qalqi> i have to clone elements one by one and then have to add them to a div element ?
[10:58:19] <wroos> I want it to toogle between content and data.
[10:58:22] <Qalqi> how should I proceed ?
[10:58:24] <px12> Qalqi, append.
[10:58:38] <klocatelli> the first time you encounter yellow (for example), set a flag marking the coordinates. the last time you set another coordinate flag. then find the distance between the two and that's the width.
[10:58:44] <wroos> It will be a textarea.
[10:58:48] <shoky> wroos so you want to change its id
[10:58:50] <wroos> px12:
[10:58:54] <px12> guys, could someone look over my problem? :P
[10:58:58] <wroos> Yes.
[10:59:02] <klocatelli> works for circle too, but gives you the diameter rather than radius. and you can use one scan for all colors
[10:59:22] <shoky> wroos: $('#something').attr('id','somethingElse')
[10:59:30] <klocatelli> if you have multiple objects for a given color (like the two rectangles in your example), and they don't overlap, you could just flood fill each object separately
[10:59:38] <Qalqi> px12, instead of appending one by one i want to put them into say a list and then add all of them at once to the div
[10:59:44] <wroos> If it is data, change it to content. If it is content change it to data.
[10:59:55] <shoky> go for it
[11:00:03] <wroos> shoky: How do I ad this to a toggle? :S
[11:00:06] <Qalqi> but this list method isnt going down without errors
[11:00:15] <shoky> wroos: add what to what toggle
[11:00:16] <klocatelli> I'm sure there's a more optimal algorithm, as those are very naive... but they're also simple and fit your requirements as presented so far, and are far simpler than implementing something like an openCL-based shape recognition algorithm :P
[11:00:27] <px12> Qalqi, well add the html to a string and then append it at once? o.O
[11:00:50] <wroos> Okay, I'll try. Thanks!
[11:01:00] <partX> Now it is becoming clearer to me.I am actually novice type in html5 and jquary.Everything was a bit of dark for me.
[11:01:51] <partX> I will try the steps you told.Thanks.
[11:01:53] <klocatelli> well frankly this has nothing to do with HTML5/jquery. those are just how you want to go about implementing the algorithms.... but really your problem is language agnostic...
[11:02:16] <klocatelli> I mean the same approach would work for python or c++ ^_^
[11:02:18] <px12> i'm sorry but i'm 'pasting' my question again. here goes, : hey guys, here's a temp link of a website i'm working on, could someone help me with this 'slow' thing? i mean.. http://blog.crister.tk/web/alphainside/index_new.htm go to the 'Events' section in this and try opening all the event details one by one, you'll notice it gets slower after each click.. i mean after seeing 6-7 details if you see others or see whatever you had seen earlier.. just open details
[11:02:18] <px12>  more than 6 7 time.. then the load time will get slower.. could someone help me with it? whole js is on the page itself right now.
[11:02:42] <Tasser> what happens if I bind more than one function via .mouseenter ? Are all of them fired or just the most recent?
[11:02:52] <partX> thanks again.
[11:03:09] <klocatelli> no problem :)
[11:03:54] <px12> Tasser, i believe all.
[11:04:06] <Tasser> can I somehow unbind handlers then?
[11:04:12] <shoky> .off
[11:04:14] <shoky> or .unbind
[11:05:10] <acodispo> I have a click() handler which targets elements with certain CSS class. When I load some content via AJAX, the click() responds to elements with that class outside the AJAX-loaded content, but not within. Is there some way to get around this?
[11:05:47] <px12> Tasser, yeah of course :)
[11:05:48] <raj> acodispo, you have to bind the click handler to the loaded content
[11:06:11] <jonmarkgo> Is the documentation wiki that JQuery uses open source?
[11:06:22] <px12> Tasser, $('#elm').unbind('mouseenter mouseleave');
[11:06:37] <px12> write whatever you want to unbind in there. :)
[11:06:43] <acodispo> raj: thanks!
[11:06:45] <Tasser> thanks
[11:06:47] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: api.jquery.com uses wordpress
[11:06:49] <px12> :)
[11:06:55] <ajpiano> and docs.jquery.com uses MediaWiki but is being deprecated
[11:07:08] <px12> yo guys, any kind of help would be appreciated. :P
[11:07:29] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: Interesting, is there a specific plugin they use for the editor? http://api.jquery.com/browser/
[11:07:35] <yamahaalex> i need help please so frustrated but its php
[11:07:44] <yamahaalex> but its very short code and I put huge comments where it works and where it broke
[11:07:45] <yamahaalex> http://pastie.org/3799488
[11:07:47] <NoiseEee> acodispo: better to use '.on' on a common parent element, and don't worry about binding new elements
[11:07:53] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: oh man, this browser thing is kind of a relic
[11:08:04] <shoky> px12 i'm looking at it but that's pretty messy :\
[11:08:06] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: we're in the middle of overhauling it all
[11:08:11] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: How is it updated, is there a WP extension or something?
[11:08:13] <ajpiano> so that the docs xml will all be on github
[11:08:15] <NoiseEee> acodispo: $('#commonParent').on('click','.classNowOrInFuture',function(){});
[11:08:17] <px12> shoky, thanks :) and sorry.
[11:08:24] <ajpiano> right now it's edited in wordpress, but like i said, github all the way
[11:08:26] <JonathanNeal> https://twitter.com/#!/jon_neal/status/191951048351547392 :)
[11:08:27] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jon_neal: Songs about coding, IE6, Modernizr, jQuery, Normalize, Papa Crockford, unicorns, and more. http://t.co/H3rFjb5e â˜… http://bit.ly/ISRbNZ
[11:08:46] <raj> did google wave really post after each character?
[11:08:49] <raj> that seems insane
[11:09:07] <shoky> px12 it looks like you're doing tons of stuff in javascript/jquery instead of in pure css
[11:09:11] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: Interesting, so its written in XML and just rendered in WP?
[11:09:12] <shoky> fix that first :\
[11:09:17] <ajpiano> yep.
[11:09:31] <jonmarkgo> Crazy
[11:09:38] <px12> shoky, well, most of it is for hover effect changing the opacity.
[11:09:44] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: we've been working with a bunch of the wp guys  as well
[11:09:51] <shoky> px12 yes you can do that with css
[11:10:02] <shoky> i think..
[11:10:03] <ajpiano> cause we basically want github for editing content and wordpress for serving everything, single sign on, etc.
[11:10:10] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: Yeah
[11:10:27] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: I was trying to find a decent documentation stylesheet or engine or what have you and can't find anything...
[11:10:34] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: documentjs looks alright, but nothing amazing
[11:10:37] <shoky> or at least just add/remove classes in your jquery code, dont start putting so much css inside the jquery code
[11:10:47] <px12> shoky, so did you even noticed the slowness after a few clicks? and yeah.. i'll try that but right now i've to set this slowness right because i've to show it to the principal of my school tomorrow :P
[11:10:55] <shoky> px12 yea
[11:10:59] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: there's that other thing as well, that automates the styling of your gh readme
[11:11:00] <shoky> heh
[11:11:06] <ajpiano> let me remember the name here for a sec
[11:11:13] <px12> shoky, i'm in high school! :P
[11:11:41] <px12> shoky, btw, how did you like the overall look of the website? :P i made it from scratch :)
[11:11:57] <px12> of course except the image slideshow plugin. :P
[11:12:11] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: http://documentup.com/
[11:12:52] <jonmarkgo> Ooh
[11:13:38] <jeffszusz_wrk> hi guys; I'm relatively new to jquery - I'm trying to use $.getJSON to grab a json object. It requires that i run a callback function, but I just want to grab the json string and stuff it into a variable. do i have to set a global in the callback function or is there some way I can do something along the lines of     data_I_want = $.getJSON(url, â€¦â€¦ )
[11:15:54] <px12> shoky: ?
[11:16:02] <shoky> px12 overall look is nice
[11:16:08] <px12> thanks :)
[11:16:39] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ jeffszusz_wrk
[11:16:40] <bot-t> jeffszusz_wrk, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[11:16:47] <shoky> px12 actually it's not getting slower if i open the events stufff
[11:16:53] <shoky> just loading the events is slow
[11:17:01] <shoky> the initial load when clicking the events button
[11:17:13] <shoky> cause its loading all those caption images
[11:17:31] <px12> well.. i was not talking about that.. i mean.. when you click on an event
[11:17:33] <shoky> you should consider using styled text instead of images for that
[11:17:44] <px12> then it slides to one side and event details appear
[11:17:51] <px12> but after seeing a few details
[11:17:59] <shoky> oh
[11:18:19] <px12> it slides after taking a bit of time after clicking on event's name.
[11:18:34] <px12> shoky, now i hope it made things clear? :P
[11:18:39] <ajpiano> jonmarkgo: fyi, https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[11:18:44] <rethus> can i do this to call my own function: $().click( toggleCheckbox($(this)) ); ?
[11:19:08] <GizmoJoe> I found the answer to my problem.  It was the fact that I am a n00b
[11:19:13] <px12> shoky: and btw, its '#md-event .event-name' that handles the clicks.
[11:19:26] <jeffszusz_wrk> GizmoJoe: that's often my main problem too.
[11:19:52] <GizmoJoe> if you try to assign the state of a checkbox to variable with the same name as the id of that checkbox without a var... ie croaks
[11:19:54] <jeffszusz_wrk> thanks Eviltwin this is a great resource
[11:20:11] <shoky> px12 you have no clue what's related to this delay? i have to start digging?
[11:20:24] <jonmarkgo> ajpiano: That's intense
[11:20:28] <GizmoJoe> which I really can't blame ie for that, I should be declaring the variables I assign.
[11:20:34] <px12> shoky, i REALLY dont have ANY clue what's causing this delay. :/
[11:20:39] <shoky> k
[11:20:54] <shoky> lets see if devtools timeline will make it quick
[11:20:59] <rethus> can i use click(myFunction(parm1,parm2)); instead click(function(){blah blah blah... yalla yalla yalla}); ?
[11:21:04] <shoky> quick to discover, that is
[11:21:27] <px12> shoky, could it be unbinding and binding handlers to elements which are loaded after the page is loaded that is causing this delay? o.O
[11:21:55] <px12> shoky, check out the 'hover_ef' things.
[11:22:01] <px12> **thing
[11:23:00] <shoky> killed muh chrome tab ;S
[11:23:31] <px12> http://blog.crister.tk/web/alphainside/index_new.htm
[11:24:28] <px12> shoky, btw, i realized that even if i open just 4 event details from the computer category it will get slow.
[11:25:57] <kitikonti> there is a jquery plugin to make the text in a block as width as the block is. but i dont remember the name
[11:27:44] <Kzim> hello, i have a javascript template using _underscore and i'm looking for a wayt to attach method to this like .reload() to refresh it's content
[11:27:51] <Kzim> any idea how to do this ? thx
[11:32:16] <shoky> px12 btw.. see ?async
[11:32:17] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[11:32:24] <antaranian> hi ladies
[11:33:08] <px12> shoky, yeah i put it there so i can wait until i get a response from the server for ajax queries. could it be the culprit?
[11:33:10] <JAAulde> Greetings, my fellow jQuerians!
[11:33:48] <px12> shoky: i mean this blog.crister.tk is running on this very system on mine so there's shouldn't be much of a lag so why is it slow even in my browser?
[11:39:06] <min|dvir|us-work> What event will fire when a user pastes text from a right-click context menu?
[11:39:55] <shoky> px12 link it to the non minified jquery
[11:40:01] <shoky> so it'll be a bit easier to debug..
[11:40:48] <px12> okay
[11:41:16] <px12> shoky, btw, i did try something
[11:41:18] <px12> see
[11:42:22] <shoky> still minified
[11:42:45] <px12> i commented the part inside the event names slide handler callback function which would do a ajax req and it actually sped up
[11:42:47] <px12> heyyy!!!
[11:42:50] <px12> i found something
[11:42:51] <px12> see
[11:42:56] <px12> open some event detail
[11:43:05] <px12> the click on 'Events' link on top again
[11:43:14] <px12> then again open event details then again Events
[11:43:23] <px12> do this as many times and it wont get any slow
[11:43:27] <px12> does this makes sense? o.O
[11:43:29] <px12> shoky?
[11:43:41] <wicchan_> anyone have any ideas how i would replace an existing dom element with another with the fadeto method? i've tried various ways already :p
[11:45:19] <shoky> px12 but then isn't it just feeding of the browser's cache?
[11:45:20] <px12> shoky, i'm seeing the code for the back arrow right now, i guess the problem is in there.. you can also see that part, '.event-details .ar-back').click...
[11:45:35] <px12> no no..
[11:45:37] <px12> see
[11:45:48] <px12> the whole website is on just one page :P
[11:46:00] <px12> ajax request adds elements to the page
[11:46:05] <shoky> ????
[11:46:09] <shoky> that makes no sense
[11:46:12] <px12> and if already present then shows the element
[11:46:25] <px12> there are 4 main elements like gallery, events, news, and contacts
[11:46:34] <px12> when someone click on either of them
[11:46:49] <px12> jquery checks if its container div is present
[11:46:51] <px12> if it is
[11:47:00] <shoky> the pages arent loaded on first page load, right..?
[11:47:04] <px12> then it just bring it into view by fadeIn
[11:47:05] <shoky> thats what the ajax is for
[11:47:06] <shoky> yes?
[11:47:21] <shoky> uh
[11:47:23] <px12> otherwise if the link is being clicked for the first time then
[11:47:26] <px12> it loads from ajax
[11:47:28] <px12> and then show.
[11:47:32] <px12> so you see
[11:47:40] <px12> i guess there's some problem in the back arrow code
[11:47:47] <shoky> so how would it work if you disabled the ajax call..?
[11:48:06] <px12> as clicking on Events link on top and click on back arrow basically does the same thing expect the 'effects'.
[11:48:54] <px12> well.. after disabling ajax calls.. both back arrow (the one which is just beside event details) and Events link on top go back to events page and it doesn't slow down
[11:49:03] <px12> but you getting what i just realized?
[11:49:13] <px12> there's some problem in the code of back arrow.
[11:49:15] <px12> lemme see
[11:49:18] <px12> i'll report back :)
[11:50:00] <shoky> that call_dcon thing also makes an ajax call
[11:50:18] <shoky> so much ajax
[11:50:21] <shoky> not that much content
[11:50:22] <shoky> blah.
[11:50:30] <px12> call_dcon is the only thing that makes ajax calls when event details are called. :P
[11:51:07] <shoky> dig further and report back when i wont have to dig myself so much ;)
[11:51:33] <RPkS> I have a button that toggles a window open & closed, but I want it to close if you touch anywhere else on the screen.
[11:51:35] <RPkS> http://pastebin.com/ABikEmrr
[11:52:07] <RPkS> Hoping that someone can take a peek at my pastebin and clue me in.
[11:52:15] <px12> shoky!!!!!!!!!!!1 foudn the problem :D :P
[11:52:17] <shoky> you can add an event handler to $(document) or $(window)
[11:52:35] <px12> actually i dont know why is it causing this delay
[11:52:36] <shoky> px awesome
[11:52:39] <shoky> heh.
[11:52:44] <px12> but check out the source code once
[11:52:51] <shoky> the delay seemed to occur before any ajax calls
[11:52:55] <shoky> before the animation..
[11:53:01] <shoky> so i dunno
[11:53:02] <px12> and see the handler for '.event-details .ar-back'
[11:53:09] <px12> noooo
[11:53:18] <px12> the delay was because of 'animate' call :/
[11:53:30] <px12> check this part of the code.. the handler for '.event-details .ar-back'
[11:54:01] <shoky> what about it
[11:54:16] <px12> i commented out animate stuff and earlier it was like $('#md-event').css('left','-980').show().animate.....  now its $('#md-event').css('left','0').show(); and now the slowness is gone.
[11:54:17] <shoky> oh theres more than one..
[11:54:57] <px12> shoky i was talking about the click one.
[11:55:15] <px12> see?
[11:55:18] <shoky> i didnt realize we were clicking on any .ar-back
[11:55:20] <shoky> thingy
[11:55:29] <shoky> were we
[11:55:49] <px12> umm.. then how were you going back to the events names section after seeing a detail?
[11:56:03] <shoky> oh, when going back, yes
[11:56:05] <shoky> gotcha
[11:56:24] <px12> so.. any ideas why this 'animate' was causing delay with every click? o.O
[11:56:48] <shoky> <px12> i commented out animate stuff and earlier it was like $('#md-event').css('left','-980').show().animate.....  now its $('#md-event').css('left','0').show(); and now the slowness is gone.
[11:56:52] <shoky> that's all you changed ?
[11:57:08] <px12> yeah.
[11:57:29] <px12> i'll change it back and you'll again be able to see the delay
[11:57:31] <px12> wait a sec
[11:57:44] <shoky> what if you put '-980px' :S
[11:57:58] <px12> yeah did the earlier thing.
[11:58:29] <px12> shoky: well actually i want the events names section on the middle when back arrow is clicked, right?
[11:58:32] <px12> anyways..
[11:58:36] <px12> see the code for it now
[11:58:42] <px12> i changed it to the earlier state
[11:58:50] <shoky> i see
[11:58:56] <px12> see it then tell me and i'll change it to what i did after it..
[11:58:57] <px12> saw?
[11:59:05] <shoky> ye
[11:59:08] <px12> now shall i change it back to the 'no delay' code? :P
[11:59:12] <shoky> no
[11:59:23] <shoky> try '-980px'
[11:59:33] <px12> that is not a good idea.. :P
[11:59:36] <px12> anyways
[11:59:38] <shoky> no?
[11:59:40] <px12> i'll do it :)
[11:59:54] <px12> well where are you talking about?
[12:00:10] <shoky> $('#md-event').css('left','-980').show().animate({
[12:00:11] <px12> shoky: inside animate or in the css('left' thing?
[12:00:22] <shoky> inside animate its 0
[12:00:29] <px12> its already that
[12:00:34] <shoky> hm?
[12:00:35] <px12> did you refreshed your page? o.O
[12:00:43] <px12> $('.event-details .ar-back').click(function() {
[12:00:44] <px12> 							//$(this).parent().parent().fadeOut('slow', function(){
[12:00:44] <px12> 							$('.event-details').fadeOut('fast', function(){
[12:00:44] <px12> 								$('#md-event').css('left','-980').show().animate({
[12:00:44] <px12> 									left: '0'
[12:00:44] <px12> 								}, 1000);
[12:00:46] <px12> 								//$('#md-event').fadeIn('fast');
[12:00:48] <px12> 							});
[12:00:49] <shoky> i mean change it to: $('#md-event').css('left','-980px').show().animate({
[12:00:50] <px12> 						});
[12:00:54] <shoky> add 'px' ..
[12:00:55] <px12> sorry i know i shouldn't have pasted here. :P
[12:01:03] <px12> ohh.. ok :)
[12:01:07] <b-lew> I have a top-139 px on a scrollto is it possible to have the same thing if I type in http://www.site.com/#anchordiv So that if you go directly to that anchor tag you don't need to scroll for things to look right...
[12:01:44] <px12> shoky, nah. it causes delay. :P
[12:01:47] <RPkS> How about my toggle close from anywhere on the screen question? http://pastebin.com/ABikEmrr
[12:02:11] <px12> 						$('.event-details .ar-back').click(function() {
[12:02:12] <px12> 							//$(this).parent().parent().fadeOut('slow', function(){
[12:02:12] <px12> 							$('.event-details').fadeOut('fast', function(){
[12:02:12] <px12> 								$('#md-event').css('left','0').show();
[12:02:12] <px12> 								/*.animate({
[12:02:12] <px12> 									left: '0'
[12:02:14] <px12> 								}, 1000);*/
[12:02:16] <px12> 								//$('#md-event').fadeIn('fast');
[12:02:18] <shoky> no delay here
[12:02:18] <px12> 							});
[12:02:19] <ajpiano> px12: STOP pasting into the channel
[12:02:20] <px12> 						});
[12:02:22] <px12> this works perfectly.
[12:02:27] <px12> ajpiano: sorry. :P
[12:02:42] <shoky> ahh only after i click the back button, i forget.
[12:03:15] <px12> yeah :P
[12:03:33] <px12> so do you understand why does the above code causes delay whereas lower one doesn't?
[12:03:35] <px12> o.O
[12:04:19] <shoky> nope
[12:04:25] <px12> :/
[12:04:27] <shoky> but your code being messy as hell probably has something to do with it
[12:04:31] <shoky> and ajaxy as hell
[12:04:58] <shoky> and async:false as hell ...........
[12:04:58] <px12> hahaha.. well ajax calls are made ONLY when required and that too only once.
[12:05:31] <shoky> hope your principal is a patient dude ;P
[12:05:31] <px12> anyways.. thanks.. i better complete the rest of stuff.. (few final touches) :P so i can sleep, its already 12:34am here :P
[12:05:39] <px12> she's a lady. :P
[12:05:40] <shoky> np
[12:05:44] <px12> and well. delay is gone now
[12:05:47] <shoky> dudette then
[12:05:50] <shoky> true.
[12:05:53] <px12> i'll solve the effects soon :)
[12:05:54] <shoky> but no animation : (
[12:06:12] <px12> yeah.. i'll try something but tomorrow i just have to show it to her :P
[12:06:21] <px12> and i KNOW she'll be happy with it :P
[12:06:26] <px12> alright then
[12:06:31] <px12> see ya, bye :)
[12:06:33] <shoky> my regards to delhi
[12:06:34] <shoky> bye
[12:06:39] <px12> :)
[12:08:23] <shoky> RPkS: [21:52:17] <shoky> you can add an event handler to $(document) or $(window)
[12:11:31] <b-lew> Is it possible to arrive at this page http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/#home_contact -> but with a margin of a -139px on that anchor tag?
[12:15:08] <fp-> he guys
[12:17:54] <fp-> can someone help me find a plugin or point me in the direction of some example code that will resemble the iOS/Apple style form that appears/transitions when you click an "Add item" button?
[12:18:26] <fp-> basically one div seemingly changes into another div, as it slides down and reveals form fields
[12:18:38] <fp-> i think 37signals has done this too
[12:20:06] <shoky> just hardcode them pixels man
[12:20:27] <fp-> dont' know how
[12:20:42] <shoky> heh im jokin anyways ;p
[12:22:21] <shoky> b-lew i dont know much bout # anchor tags and scrolling, but you can access it from javascript with location.href
[12:22:23] <Marchitos> How can i detect the scrool event with firefox? tried lot of example, but firefox gets black
[12:22:31] <shoky> and call .scrollTo or whatever based on it
[12:22:41] <johnkpaul> Marchitos: the window scrolle vent?
[12:22:45] <johnkpaul> ?scroll @Marchitos
[12:22:46] <bot-t> Marchitos, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[12:23:04] <johnkpaul> if you want to get the scroll event for the not-window, you have to use a plugin
[12:23:14] <shoky> really?
[12:23:17] <johnkpaul> ?g ben alman scroll plugin

[12:23:48] <johnkpaul> hm, that's not the right one
[12:24:04] <shoky> naw man googles knows you better than you
[12:24:16] <shoky> google*
[12:24:23] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:24:33] <Marchitos> i added this to body http://pastebin.com/Ne2XtABM
[12:24:41] <Marchitos> is it okay? it make firefox black!
[12:24:55] <johnkpaul> Marchitos: don't alert
[12:24:56] <johnkpaul> console.log
[12:24:58] <johnkpaul> and it will be fine
[12:25:01] <Marchitos> ah sorry
[12:25:05] <johnkpaul> window.scroll events happen A LOT
[12:25:24] <jeffheard> doing an $.ajax({ type : 'POST' }), and for some reason the HTTP_ACCEPT header is always 'undefined'.  Is there something I'm missing?  I've set accept : 'application/json' in the request itself.
[12:25:24] <johnkpaul> and alert() blocks
[12:25:24] <johnkpaul> so when you scroll, even a little bit, you're adding a lot of alerts to the event loop
[12:25:54] <Marchitos> ahh
[12:26:25] <Marchitos> perfect, working :) thank you a lot
[12:26:55] <shoky> johnkpaul how come you say that for non-windows you need a plugin?
[12:27:05] <johnkpaul> Marchitos: no problem
[12:27:06] <shoky> what do you mean by non-windows?
[12:27:10] <johnkpaul> shoky: because there is no scrolle vent
[12:27:17] <sphinxxx> jeffheard:  show code or a jsfiddle
[12:27:21] <johnkpaul> there is no $("div").scroll()
[12:27:24] <shoky> there is
[12:27:25] <johnkpaul> natively
[12:27:35] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/qn4Ny/
[12:27:41] <shoky> or i'm misunderstanding u
[12:28:02] <johnkpaul> oh, no, you're not, I'm wrong then
[12:28:14] <johnkpaul> I'm fairly sure that's being faked by jquery
[12:28:31] <shoky> well sure it does what needs to be done
[12:28:46] <shoky> thats what its for ;p
[12:29:17] <johnkpaul> :) yes, of course
[12:29:18] <b-lew> shoky: its going to the right place i just need a negative margin on it so the navigation isn't covering up the content when I get go to the anchor tags since my navigation is fixed at the top of the page
[12:30:44] <shoky> buh that is a long sentence
[12:32:41] <Marchitos> and why this is always telling 0 ? http://pastebin.com/VqaAvBpr

[12:33:43] <rodrigov_> Hello everyone, is there any modern plugin for jQuery that does the same as livequery?
[12:34:20] <rodrigov_> livequery does not work with jquery 1.7.1
[12:34:24] <sphinxxx> Marchitos: it will be 0 if the parent element is on display:none
[12:34:40] <Marchitos> body hasn't display:none
[12:34:52] <johnkpaul> rodrigov_: livequery is built in
[12:34:54] <Marchitos> maybe i have to force display:block?
[12:35:03] <johnkpaul> ?on @rodrigov_
[12:35:03] <bot-t> rodrigov_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[12:42:55] <_Tristan> Hello. If you were an independent contractor and someone asked you to make a fading dropdown, how many hours would you likely bill them for?
[12:43:16] <_Tristan> no sub menus on this dropdown, btw
[12:43:30] <sphinxxx> as much as possible
[12:43:31] <ajpiano> the number of hours you took to code it
[12:44:19] <_Tristan> I did bill the number of hours I took to code it, what I want to know is if I billed more or less than average
[12:44:37] <shoky> johnkpaul i'm not sure i understand that.. is it just old, before .scroll() worked "natively" with jquery?
[12:44:43] <rodrigov_> bot-t: thanks
[12:44:44] <bot-t> ;)
[12:45:06] <rodrigov_> what event is triggered by client-side JS when the DOM is changed?
[12:45:06] <johnkpaul> shoky: the link that I sent was for adding another layer of abstraction over the scrolle vent
[12:45:13] <johnkpaul> like "scrollstart" and "scrollend"
[12:45:39] <shoky> oh i see
[12:45:47] <shoky> nice to know
[12:46:17] <ajpiano> _Tristan: i don't know why you'd expect someone to have an "average" amount of time they spend on a particular project that you actually had with no other specifics about it
[12:46:22] <warrenparsons> _Tristan: It really depends on the complexity of the dropdown's design, effects, etc., plus your individual efficiency as a developer.
[12:46:36] <_Tristan> this is turning out to be much more complicated than I thought
[12:48:13] <_Tristan> on the one hand, if I tell them it took two hours (it did) then I get moderate pay, but if I tell them it took four, chances are they wouldn't even notice, and some distillery somewhere would get charged a bit extra, which they kind of already deserve for hiring a company that has the words "SUPER SEO" on it's homepage...
[12:48:58] <warrenparsons> _Tristan: Are you asking whether any of us would choose to be unethical in our billing, with the justification being "they'll never know?"
[12:49:17] <_Tristan> maybe
[12:49:49] <_Tristan> I mean, say you can do the same work twice as fast as others, but your resume doesn't yet grant you super high hourly rates...
[12:50:19] <bjensen> No takers on a recommendation for a in place plugin? aw..
[12:50:38] <warrenparsons> _Tristan: All it would take is one client to get wind of what's happening to have your reputation ruined.
[12:50:55] <warrenparsons> Good luck billing at a high rate after that.
[12:51:10] <bambams> I'm trying to use jQuery tabs with dynamic content. The content is fetched with Web service calls, and they're heavy enough that loading up all tabs isn't desirable.
[12:51:34] <bambams> Is it possible to use tabs without corresponding contents and then dynamically fill the contents with events?
[12:51:43] <_Tristan> yes
[12:52:58] <warrenparsons> _Tristan: Also, I don't estimate projects based purely on an houry rate. If I'm taking on a 2-hour project, my total estimate is going to be how much money I want to spend two hours of my time working on it.
[12:54:06] <warrenparsons> _Tristan: If you've already told the client you're charging them X dollars per hour, then the only ethical option now is to be honest about how much time it took and bill them appropriately.
[12:54:26] <_Tristan> this is a deep ethical dilemma which hurts my brain a bit, so I'm going to shelve the concept of exaggerating my hours...
[12:54:32] <ajpiano> i mean
[12:54:36] <_Tristan> and now I have to go do something great...
[12:54:38] <ajpiano> you can also charge them for time spent meeting and communicating etc
[12:54:54] <ajpiano> the idea that any thing that someone would pay a web developer money for would literally involve exactly 120 minutes of effort is kind of insane
[12:55:02] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: Definitely.
[12:55:19] <ajpiano> and that only time spent typing into your editor counts, etc.
[12:55:30] <warrenparsons> ajpiano Treating web dev as a "time and materials" endeavor is foolish.
[12:55:41] <ajpiano> ya
[12:55:57] <slackware> How is it called when at a given event, jquery makes so that the user can type in a selected input
[12:56:12] <slackware> it makes like if the user clicked on the input
[12:56:16] <warrenparsons> But "charging extra" after the fact is never a good choice.
[12:57:09] <slackware> like in gogle
[12:57:12] <slackware> google(
[12:57:24] <slackware> as soon as you start writing, it goes to the search box
[12:57:28] <warrenparsons> slackware: I believe the .focus() is what you're after.
[12:57:43] <warrenparsons> ?focus @ slackware
[12:57:43] <bot-t> slackware, .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[12:58:10] <warrenparsons> slackware: You want the second use case, where focus is triggered.
[12:59:00] <slackware> like that ? https://gist.github.com/2401099
[12:59:08] <warrenparsons> Yep.
[12:59:19] <slackware> hehe :P
[12:59:24] <slackware> dat jquery, so easy man
[12:59:28] <warrenparsons> slackware: Well, put the period in the right place ;)
[12:59:38] <lpin> hello guys i'm trying to write an exact match .contains selector
[12:59:38] <warrenparsons> slackware: $('body').click(...
[12:59:41] <slackware> whoops!
[12:59:55] <slackware> typed it too fast, didnt want you to go away
[13:00:03] <lpin> i ended up with this
[13:00:04] <lpin> $.expr[":"].econtains = function(obj, index, meta, stack) {
[13:00:04] <lpin> 		return (obj.textContent || obj.innerText ||
[13:00:04] <lpin> 				$(obj).text() || "").toLowerCase() === meta[3].toLowerCase();
[13:00:04] <lpin> 	};
[13:00:36] <lpin> but doesnt seems to work if the text of the dom element is say "text"
[13:00:45] <lpin> with quotes included
[13:00:47] <warrenparsons> ?jsfiddle @ lpin
[13:00:47] <bot-t> lpin, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[13:01:07] <lpin> ok i'll create one
[13:01:19] <lpin> give me 1 min or two :)
[13:01:22] <warrenparsons> Thanks.
[13:01:48] <warrenparsons> lpin: It lets us not only read your code more easily, but provide fixes and suggestions inline, rather than in chat.
[13:01:50] <slackware> warrenparsons, and is that called? I "binded" an event handler to focus or I "triggered" the event?
[13:01:58] <slackware> warrenparsons, and what** is that called? I "binded" an event handler to focus or I "triggered" the event?
[13:02:08] <lpin> yeah sure
[13:02:32] <warrenparsons> slackware: In the case of your gist, you're "binding" the click event on the body to "trigger" the focus event on your input.
[13:03:08] <slackware> Alright thanks alot :P
[13:03:21] <warrenparsons> slackware: When you're watching (or "listening") for an event, it's called "binding." When you're executing an event, it's called "triggering."
[13:03:39] <slackware> I see
[13:06:04] <Tasser> how would I move an element to another element? so <div id="foo"><element></div><div id="bar"><element></div> => <div id="foo"></div><div id="bar"><element></div>
[13:06:58] <ajpiano> Tasser: every manipulation method moves elements by default
[13:07:07] <ajpiano> $("#foo").appendTo("#bar") moves foo into bar
[13:07:12] <slackware> What If I want this event to happen except when the #input is selected? I go $('body:not(#input)') ?
[13:07:18] <ajpiano> but it's not clear what you want from your example, it just looks like you want to empty the content of foo
[13:07:48] <warrenparsons> slackware: I don't quite understand what you mean.
[13:09:08] <slackware> Because you see, I want to control every detail. From that function I showed, as soon as the user types a letter, this letter is typed into the input. I want him to press a button, the input gets focuses, and THEN he can type what he wants
[13:09:10] <goodknight> Is there a benefit to extracting pieces of code and putting them in their own separate functions and calling them as needed versus just putting all the code in a document.ready and letting it all run?
[13:09:37] <lpin> ok
[13:09:39] <lpin> http://jsfiddle.net/km5QU/
[13:09:41] <warrenparsons> goodknight: Lots of benefits - ease of readability, ease of updating, portability...
[13:10:01] <lpin> both select same DOM element
[13:10:17] <warrenparsons> slackware: It sounds like just putting focus in the input at document.ready would do what you want.
[13:10:19] <kpozin> Any jQuery Mobile devs here? I'm trying to figure how you guys chose when to use "vclick" events and when to use "click" events on the various widgets.
[13:10:26] <goodknight> thanks warrenparsons, but besides developer ease, does it add a benefit to memory consumption, bandwidth conservation, etc?
[13:10:45] <rmurphey> goodknight: developer ease is reason enough :)
[13:10:46] <slackware> warrenparsons, well this too
[13:10:53] <slackware> but
[13:10:54] <rmurphey> aka maintainability, reusability, testability
[13:10:58] <warrenparsons> goodknight: Hard to say. But we write code for developers to read, not computers.
[13:11:24] <warrenparsons> Bad phrasing..
[13:11:42] <warrenparsons> goodknight: In most cases, it's more important that a developer can easily read your code than for a computer to easily read it.
[13:11:58] <goodknight> thanks rmurphey and warrenparsons - good to know
[13:12:11] <slackware> warrenparsons, how do I do so that as soon as the user presses a button on his keyboard, the input is focused, but the letters is not written?
[13:12:26] <slackware> I tried preventDefault(), but that makes me unable to type in the input
[13:12:45] <slackware> Can't I just go like so? $('body:not(#input)'). etc
[13:12:56] <slackware> It does not work
[13:13:20] <warrenparsons> slackware: Can you please explain, step by step, what you're trying to accomplish? If I understand the "why" I can better help you with the "how."
[13:13:34] <slackware> I told you,  I think you did not read well
[13:13:43] <warrenparsons> slackware: Very possible.
[13:13:44] <slackware> As soon as the user presses a button, the 3input is focused
[13:13:47] <NoiseEee> "but the letters is not written"
[13:13:48] <rmurphey> slackware: maybe put together a jsfiddle?
[13:13:50] <slackware> #input *
[13:13:54] <slackware> waiit
[13:14:11] <slackware> but with the script i've shown you, the letter he types get typed into the input
[13:14:11] <lpin> what i'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/km5QU/
[13:14:36] <warrenparsons> slackware: So you want the first character the visitor types to NOT go into the input?
[13:14:36] <slackware> So I want the user to: press a button -> the #input gets focus() ed -> then the user types in what he wants
[13:14:42] <slackware> yeah
[13:14:54] <warrenparsons> slackware: You want to set up a keyboard shortcut for that input?
[13:15:04] <slackware> uhm
[13:15:06] <slackware> nah
[13:15:13] <slackware> any button will go to that input
[13:15:25] <slackware> will focus* that input
[13:15:38] <warrenparsons> slackware: You can set up a listener for the 'keypress' event (look that up, it might be 'keydown'â€¦), and have that trigger the .focus()
[13:15:57] <warrenparsons> slackware: But depending how you do it, the user experience might be bad.
[13:16:58] <bambams> Example of what I am failing at:   http://jsfiddle.net/X6Ne4/4/
[13:17:34] <bambams> The tabs don't seem to work this way.
[13:18:14] <slackware> warrenparsons: That is what I did, I binded a keypress to body
[13:18:31] <slackware> and I preventDefault();
[13:18:37] <slackware> look
[13:18:43] <slackware> how to make an exception?
[13:18:53] <slackware> I do not want this function to be executed when it is in the input
[13:18:54] <ajpiano> slackware: what you actually have to do is bind a keypress to the document and a keypress to the input that stops any keypresses in it from propagating to the document
[13:19:02] <slackware> ('body:not(#input)') does not work
[13:19:04] <ajpiano> slackware: you need to stopPropagation(), not preventDefault()
[13:19:13] <ajpiano> slackware: your body tag is *obviously* not the element with the id input
[13:19:24] <ajpiano> which is what $("body:not(input)")
[13:19:36] <ajpiano> does
[13:19:45] <ajpiano> it says "give me all body tags that don't have id input")
[13:19:54] <slackware> oh I see
[13:20:23] <slackware> then how Do I do 'give me all your *body* except that one "input" '
[13:21:07] <ajpiano> i just described how
[13:21:07] <warrenparsons> There's a pickup line...
[13:21:40] <slackware> so the ('document') does not include the (#input) in it?
[13:22:16] <ajpiano> do you understand how event bubbling works at all, it's kind of an important thing to grok to get why this has to happen the way it does
[13:22:42] <slackware> Yeah I suppose I do
[13:23:43] <slackware> you bind an event to something, lets sat the body/(or as you said, the document), and ater that, you can make another event on something else
[13:23:54] <slackware> after* that
[13:24:06] <ajpiano> that's not what event bubbling is
[13:24:21] <ajpiano> that's just binding different handlers to do different things
[13:24:31] <slackware> So what does bubbling mean?
[13:24:41] <ajpiano> slackware: what's the idea here? to make it so typing anywhere on the page puts you in the input and starts you typing?
[13:24:52] <slackware> yeah
[13:24:59] <ajpiano> sounds like terrible UX but whatevs
[13:25:30] <RPkS> I need more details about adding an event handler to $(document) or $(window) to make a Toggled window close with any click, buit on the window itself. I have been reading and I cannot seem to stumble over what I need.
[13:25:37] <slackware> Whatever, thanks alot anyways
[13:25:55] <ajpiano> slackware: hold one sec
[13:26:36] <slackware> exceptions do not exist in jQuery?
[13:26:53] <ajpiano> slackware: http://jsfiddle.net/ehZjF/1/
[13:27:13] <warrenparsons> slackware http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/k5Et7/
[13:27:28] <warrenparsons> Dammit..
[13:27:38] <slackware> THAT! :)
[13:27:40] <slackware> thanks alot :P
[13:27:58] <RPkS> Here us a jsfiddle of my toggle window    http://jsfiddle.net/brick11/xUMH5/10/
[13:28:31] <shoky> bambams: you're not following the tabs docs ..
[13:30:09] <shoky> bambams: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/X6Ne4/5/
[13:30:25] <shoky> it had nothing to do with dynamic loading
[13:32:32] <ajpiano> slackware: by the way, the reason we all say it's "bad UX" is because like
[13:32:46] <ajpiano> it's kind of a #dickmove to people who like to use their arrow keys or the page down button
[13:32:47] <ajpiano> etc.
[13:33:13] <shoky> what am i supposed to read '#' as ?
[13:33:28] <shoky> is this twitterspeak
[13:33:39] <shoky> just askin yo.
[13:33:48] <ajpiano> i donno, it's just a habit of mine to use #dickmove as a hashtag instead of "dick move"
[13:33:55] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: It's also just plain odd that typing *any* character focuses the input, and subsequent key presses are captured in that input.
[13:34:03] <ajpiano> warrenparsons: that too
[13:34:21] <shoky> gotcha
[13:34:22] <warrenparsons> I can't imagine any use case where that would be intuitive or desirable behavior.
[13:35:17] <slackware> ajpiano: Why did you need to put thekeydown function with the stopPropagation in a variable?
[13:35:34] <ajpiano> slackware: you don't *need* to
[13:35:40] <ajpiano> i just dont like to query the dom again to get the input
[13:35:41] <ajpiano> inside of the handler
[13:35:45] <ajpiano> when you could reference it beforehand
[13:35:57] <lpin> mmm figured out maybe
[13:35:58] <lpin> http://jsfiddle.net/km5QU/1/
[13:36:17] <slackware> Ohhh I see what you did there
[13:36:26] <lpin> seems to work now
[13:38:32] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: That threw me for a bit of a loop at first till I got it. My *preference* would still be to assign the var once, querying at that point, then using the var as a separate step. Naturally, I didn't do that in my jsfiddle...
[13:39:01] <ajpiano> warrenparsons: ya i mean six of one, half a dozen of the other really
[13:39:18] <shoky> hmm. is there a way to tell the browser: hey, im gonna make some changes to these dom elements, but i only want you to render them when they're all done
[13:39:39] <shoky> and i mean dom elements that are in the active dom
[13:39:43] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: Indeed. I think I'd suffer some slings and arrows from my team if I adopted that style, however.
[13:40:32] <shoky> and by 'when theyre all done' i mean 'when i say so'
[13:43:03] <mwarning> hi, my cgi script sends a text file that was requested using $.post("/cgi-bin/myscript", { path: "get_net_list" }); but the file open dialog doesn't show up. I've used the correct file headers in the cgi script (Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..." etc.).
[13:43:32] <mwarning> Is there smth. I need to take care on the browser/jquery side?
[13:45:01] <shoky> i dont think you can do that with a simple ajax request
[13:45:13] <shoky> you gotta location.href = '...'
[13:45:16] <shoky> on some frame maybe
[13:45:26] <shoky> @ mwarning
[13:46:29] <shoky> or just on the top window
[13:46:47] <shoky> shouldn't destroy the current document
[13:46:55] <shoky> if the headers are good
[13:47:05] <mwarning> shoky, thanks; the reason I use the jquery there is because I want to send the argument via post.
[13:47:15] <shoky> you can do that with a form
[13:47:25] <shoky> submit it via js
[13:47:27] <shoky> or whatever
[13:47:46] <mwarning> hm, might work - will try
[13:47:51] <mwarning> shoky, thanks
[13:47:55] <shoky> no reason it shouldn't
[13:47:56] <shoky> np
[13:57:11] <sunbeam> When i have a form on my temporary under construction site, where i would like users to be able to subscribe (only input e-mail) how can i best handle this with ajax? i know how to do it code wise, but how can i best structure the code for it? the ajax handling should happen in the same index file? can someone advice me this?
[13:58:13] <bambams> shoky: o_O What did you change? Or more specifically, what part fo the docs was I violating?
[13:58:40] <mwarning> shoky: works now :)
[13:58:52] <bambams> shoky: Nevermind, I don't think you understand what I'm asking.. :\
[13:59:22] <bambams> shoky: I know how to use tabs normally. I don't want to have separate <div id="Foo"> and <div id="Bar">, one for each tab.
[13:59:26] <astropirate> snoky want snok snok
[13:59:29] <bambams> shoky: I want to have a single destination.
[13:59:36] <astropirate> XD

[14:41:16] <Parhs> hello guys
[14:41:23] <Parhs> i have a problem with jquery
[14:41:31] <Parhs> its specific to firefox i believe
[14:41:38] <waterismemory> hi hi
[14:41:42] <waterismemory> i am using jquery tab control
[14:41:48] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/services/services-compare
[14:41:51] <waterismemory> how do i know which tab is on top?
[14:42:23] <Parhs> in firefox when selecting checkboxes columns appear squeezed
[14:42:34] <Parhs> because hide() sets table-cell display not hidde
[14:42:52] <Parhs> waterismemory propably a css class
[14:43:17] <waterismemory> really?
[14:44:00] <rroelofs> waterismemory: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#option-selected
[14:51:11] <ML74> maybe off-topic. but could someone help me with a navigation bar?
[14:54:03] <pwf> what would be the cleanest way to remove an iframe from within that iframe
[14:54:21] <pwf> like if the iframe loads a script that calls removeFromParent(window)
[14:54:34] <pwf> how can i access the iframe object in the parent
[14:54:37] <deAtog> does calling $.one multiple times with the same function cause the function to be executed as many times as $.one was called?
[14:54:40] <johnkpaul> pwf: in the same domain? window.top.querySelector("iframe");
[14:54:52] <pwf> johnkpaul: there could be any number of these iframes though
[14:54:54] <johnkpaul> deAtog: try it
[14:55:04] <pwf> i'm trying to replace the ugly popups in django admin inlines with an iframe
[14:55:42] <pwf> so they click add, an iframe loads with the django admin page with the hidden 'popup' element, and on save it calls javascript code in window.parent
[14:55:51] <pwf> which will remove the iframe that called the function
[14:56:28] <johnkpaul> pwf: I haven't tried this, so I don't realy know, but I'd try to filter src's by window.location
[14:56:47] <deAtog> johnkpaul: it's ok if it does.. I was just curious.. I've got a really simple function that just set a variable to false that I'm binding to an event using $.one.. I was just curious if $.one was smart enough not to bind the same function multiple times
[14:57:02] <pwf> i suppose i could also use .data
[14:57:20] <pwf> i was just wondering if there was an easier way to get the element from the iframe's window object
[14:57:22] <pwf> i guess not though
[14:57:42] <shoky> bambams: you didn't have any href in your <a>'s i think
[14:58:06] <johnkpaul> deAtog: I don't actually know, from the source I'd assume that it would bind multiple times
[14:58:09] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.one
[14:58:13] <johnkpaul> but I didn't read it very carefully
[14:59:21] <shoky> bambams: and if you know how to use it normally then why aren't you doing that?
[15:02:59] <Parhs> hello.. Can anyone help me with the bug?
[15:03:11] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/services/services-compare
[15:06:27] <lennyj> hello. when using $.data() to develop a plugin, do i need to set the data object every time i change it?
[15:07:39] <xp_prg> I have this: div#tabs ul li:nth-child(3) { but I want both 3 and 4, is there a way to specify that?
[15:07:59] <ryanneufeld> ?next() @ xp_prg
[15:07:59] <bot-t> xp_prg, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:08:13] <xp_prg> no in the css itself
[15:08:35] <ryanneufeld> xp_prg: this channel is for jquery, try #css
[15:09:04] <ryanneufeld> xp_prg: also using selectors like that in jquery is very inefficient
[15:09:13] <xp_prg> its not in jquery
[15:09:19] <johnkpaul> :)
[15:09:24] <ryanneufeld> xp_prg: then why are you asking in the jquery channel?
[15:09:29] <johnkpaul> then you should really be in #css
[15:09:32] <xp_prg> cuz your smarter then everyone else
[15:09:48] <ryanneufeld> xp_prg: flattery might get you laid, but you're still in the wrong channel
[15:10:03] <johnkpaul> lennyj: $.data stores key value pairs associated with a particular dom element
[15:10:07] <johnkpaul> what do you mean by "the data object"?
[15:10:15] <xp_prg> yup css channel is not answer my question :(
[15:11:03] <lennyj> johnkpaul: i guess i'm asking if i need to use data() to keep state on a dom element in a plugin
[15:11:25] <ryanneufeld> xp_prg: DYGI?
[15:11:44] <johnkpaul> you definitely don't _have_ to, it is a common practice though
[15:12:01] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery plugin patterns @ lennyj
[15:12:02] <bot-t> lennyj, Essential jQuery Plugin Patterns | Smashing Coding - http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[15:12:05] <xp_prg> kind of ya
[15:12:15] <Stuffness> xp_prg, is this for a css selector or a jquery selector
[15:13:02] <lennyj> johnkpaul: what's the alternative? just keeping data in variables inside $.myPlugin = function(){...}?
[15:13:26] <johnkpaul> lennyj: it's probably better to organize what state you need to store in one particular object, and store that rather than individual keys/values
[15:13:48] <johnkpaul> lennyj: there are lots of alternatives. window._myPlugin.instance = {}, or domElement.instance={}
[15:13:51] <johnkpaul> neither of which are good ideas
[15:13:51] <xp_prg> css selector
[15:13:57] <Stuffness> xp_prg, try li:nth-child(n+3):nth-child(-n+4)
[15:15:37] <lennyj> johnkpaul: okay, i'll stick to convention. i'm still a little confused about how it works though. is the actual object stored with data(), or is it serialized back and forth every time you call data()?
[15:16:13] <xp_prg> ok
[15:16:28] <lennyj> aka, do i need to get and set it every time i want to make a change?
[15:16:48] <johnkpaul> lennyj: that depends on how you use it
[15:16:50] <johnkpaul> lennyj: https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.basic.plugin-boilerplate.js
[15:16:55] <johnkpaul> take that as an example
[15:16:56] <ajpiano> lennyj: there is an actual object
[15:16:59] <ajpiano> there is no "serialization"
[15:17:40] <nattyp> hail all
[15:17:47] <ajpiano> if you do var foo = $("#foo"), fData = $.data( foo[0] ); fData.bar = "baz";  then $("#foo").data("bar") === "baz";
[15:17:47] <Stuffness> xp_prg, here http://jsfiddle.net/7W54p/
[15:17:54] <johnkpaul> ah, there's a $.cache that stores it all
[15:17:58] <ajpiano> i think that's what you were asking before
[15:19:20] <lennyj> ajpiano: makes sense, thanks guys
[15:19:40] * Stuffness slowly strangles xp_prg
[15:19:49] <johnkpaul> I never looked into how $.data worked before, it's actually fairly straightforward code
[15:19:59] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js
[15:20:08] <johnkpaul> in case anyone wants to take a look
[15:20:58] <shoky> most jquery code is fairly straightforward , from what i've seen so far
[15:21:43] <johnkpaul> that's true, so far everything but animation, I've felt that way about
[15:21:57] <shoky> hmm i haven't digged into that yet
[15:24:22] <coin3d> when i iterate through the tr's of a table with .each, will "this" always point to the current table row?
[15:24:37] <shoky> yup
[15:24:58] <coin3d> hmm
[15:25:19] <Stuffness> xp_prg
[15:26:25] <shoky> coin3d, unless of course you change the context in the .each callback
[15:26:54] <shoky> e.g. by adding another .each inside
[15:32:46] <sarspazam> anyone know if there are some slightly more light weight versions of curtain.js?
[15:34:43] <erik-landvall> sarspazam, I dont know if I understand what you need. What are you gonna use it for?
[15:35:42] <sarspazam> really just interested if there are any alternatives?
[15:35:49] <ML74> is there a way to delete all content from within a div?
[15:35:57] <erik-landvall> sarspazam, I made something like this ones for a site ones.. been working on it alot after that
[15:36:05] <erik-landvall> You can take a look if  u like
[15:36:16] <sarspazam> if that's cool yeah
[15:36:28] <erik-landvall> https://github.com/erik-landvall/trek
[15:36:38] <erik-landvall> Let me show u a demo
[15:36:49] <ryanneufeld> ?empty @ ML74
[15:36:49] <bot-t> ML74, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[15:37:07] <tab1293> how come the use of jquery's ui destroys the functionality of this menu http://jsfiddle.net/tab1293/DExf8/3/
[15:37:11] <erik-landvall> sarspazam, this is an erly implementation of it..
[15:37:12] <erik-landvall> http://tikksweden.se/
[15:37:16] <tab1293> if you remove the "slow" parameter it works
[15:37:18] <q2wer1> http://jsfiddle.net/AaVfd/ why does this always return 1?
[15:37:36] <erik-landvall> I have like I said worked on it alot seens then
[15:37:42] <ML74> cheers :)
[15:38:04] <q2wer1> i guess it has something to do with my selector... ?
[15:38:08] <sarspazam> that's quite cool erik-landvall, although what i'm looking for is more of a scroll effect
[15:38:23] <sarspazam> http://curtain.victorcoulon.fr/
[15:38:35] <erik-landvall> sarspazam, ok. Like I said, dident understan realy what you where after.
[15:38:37] <ryanneufeld> q2wer1: what are you expecting it to return?
[15:39:19] <q2wer1> ryanneufeld the href attribute of the 'clicked' element, so #1, #2, #3, #4 instead of always returning #1 even though i was clicking #4
[15:40:11] <ryanneufeld> q2wer1: then it looks like you don't understand how selectors work.
[15:40:22] <ryanneufeld> q2wer1: see ?selectors
[15:40:22] <bot-t> q2wer1, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[15:41:41] <ryanneufeld> q2wer1: here's a clue for you: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/AaVfd/1/
[15:41:50] <ryanneufeld> notice what the console is logging?
[15:43:18] <q2wer1> right, i dont know the syntax of saying this + ' a '
[15:43:39] <ajpiano> ?concatobj
[15:43:39] <bot-t> You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[15:43:51] <ajpiano> q2wer1: $(this).find("a")
[15:44:07] <nattyp> trying to parse xml with namespaced elements e.g. dc:title,  should I be trying to find 'title' or 'dc:title'
[15:44:10] <q2wer1> ok thanks
[15:46:46] <q2wer1> on the same subject is that a proper design pattern to use #image_name_for_anchor to have whatever thumbnail was selected by linkable
[15:47:11] <q2wer1> be*
[15:48:13] <q2wer1> well actually i know thats fine...
[15:48:21] <ajpiano> q2wer1: what you want is to also cancel the default
[15:48:23] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/AaVfd/2/
[15:49:03] <q2wer1> ah ok, i thought by default '#' most browsers know not to actually go anywhere
[15:49:20] <q2wer1> i guess thats more for compatibility for older browsers?
[15:49:23] <ajpiano> they will add the hash to the url though
[15:49:26] <ajpiano> which is uggerz
[15:49:32] <q2wer1> ah ok
[15:50:07] <q2wer1> whats the best way to handle the 'anchor' if the visitor refreshes or links someone etc.
[15:50:16] <q2wer1> just parse the URi normally? on window.load ?
[15:51:09] <ajpiano> ?bbq
[15:51:09] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[15:52:48] <q2wer1> well i perosnally dont want to 'pollute' a visitors browsing history with every image they viewed, just want to make images linkable, but i'll look at that plugin to extract what i need from it
[15:53:26] <shennyg> Is there a JQuery equivalent to PHP's range method "Create an array containing a range of elements" : http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.range.php
[15:53:37] <ajpiano> q2wer1: yeah you can implement whatever you want
[15:54:23] <q2wer1> on an unrelated subject though, a web site like https://squareup.com/ with heavy image loading, do they / is there a way they lazy load images that aren't needed to be displayed right away? like having a priority system for loading?
[15:54:49] <b-lew> am I doing this right at all?
[15:54:50] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/3801017
[15:56:05] <ryanneufeld> b-lew: assuming $anchor is a gobal variable that happens to be a jquery collection where the first item is the one you want, Yeah. you're doing it right
[15:56:49] <b-lew> okay great
[15:56:56] <b-lew> thanks ryanneufeld
[15:57:03] <b-lew> i suck at jquery horribly
[15:57:11] <b-lew> going to start reading.. haha
[15:57:17] <ryanneufeld> b-lew: using console.log() helps too
[15:57:26] <ryanneufeld> checkout jsfiddle.net
[15:57:56] <b-lew> it says  $anchor is not defined
[15:57:59] <b-lew> hrmmm
[15:58:09] <q2wer1> shennyg: the 'stepping' function would be pretty easy to write
[15:58:50] <q2wer1> generating a number range would be easy, the a-z one, you'd probably need to populate an array with a-z first though
[15:58:53] <shennyg> I'm planning on ripping out this function: https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L448
[16:02:17] <b-lew> ryanneufeld: what about this? http://pastie.org/3801017
[16:08:54] <ryanneufeld> b-lew: you can't just scrollTop: $($anchor.attr('href')).offset().top-139 } 1500,'easeOutBounce');
[16:09:04] <ryanneufeld> ?animate() @ b-lew
[16:09:04] <bot-t> b-lew, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:09:31] <b-lew> hummm this is a tricky problem
[16:12:00] <cgiGeek> morning need a jquery consultant to fix a broken project, please page me with your hourly fee
[16:12:33] <markq> cgiGeek: what's the problem?
[16:13:22] <cgiGeek> hmm I have  an upload form with the progress bar working, but only works for one upload, if i add more file types it doesnt work
[16:17:31] <lotus> hiya, I want to drag an image from one website, drop it onto my website, and have my website detect the original image url -- how can I do this?
[16:18:47] <sunbeam> is this a proper way of handling a form? http://pastebin.com/bUHHj62y
[16:18:52] <ryanneufeld> lotus you'd need to be a magician
[16:19:09] <lotus> ryanneufeld: why?  :(
[16:19:20] <ryanneufeld> lotus: that would be dependent on the browser and the OS
[16:19:56] <lotus> ryanneufeld: I'd be happy to get it working in any browser on any OS.  I know that Chrome allows me to drop an image on a new tab and have the image open -- I'm thinking that the image information is there...
[16:22:01] <ML74> what's the best way to fade an image from visibility:hidden to visible?
[16:22:19] <ML74> ***what's the best way to fade a div from visibility:hidden to visible?
[16:22:38] <lotus> ML74: incrementally set the opacity property would be my first thought
[16:22:58] <lotus> ML74: jQuery UI has a nice fade method, though
[16:24:00] <lotus> Don't know if that's helpful or not :P
[16:24:24] <ML74> cheers :)
[16:24:36] <lotus> Namaste!
[16:35:13] <nexion> if have a button that needs to fade out some old content and fade in some other content, should I initiate the fadeIn in the 'callback' of fadeOut, or is there a better way, like queuing?
[16:36:30] <nexion> I'm just starting to notice subtle bugs like the faded in version being animated to opacity 1 but having display:none if the button is pressed twice with a specific interval
[16:36:38] <nexion> so I'm looking for ways to make it more robust
[16:40:11] <PerfM> YEA SON
[16:41:57] <m0dmd> sup everyone
[16:53:05] <bambams> shoky: Sorry, been AFK for a few hours. >_< I didn't have href attributes because there is no sensible value that matters.
[16:53:33] <bambams> shoky: I don't want jQuery to infer what do when the tab is activated. I just want it to track the state/styles and fire events.
[16:53:35] <shoky> it matters to jquery ui
[16:53:54] <bambams> shoky: It seems jQuery UI wasn't designed for this though, so I'll have to hack around it with meaningless elements.. >:(
[16:54:33] <shoky> or maybe you could find a way to work with it
[16:54:41] <shoky> whatever works for ya.
[16:54:52] <shoky> now you know that you need those hrefs
[16:54:55] <shoky> work with it
[16:54:58] <shoky> ynot ;p
[16:55:00] <m0dmd> anyone recommends a jquery image annotator that supports multiple image sizes
[16:55:03] <bambams> The application was designed by other people. I was against the design from the beginning.
[16:55:14] <shoky> ah, that application
[16:55:18] <bambams> But the entire application is written dynamically with JavaScript. Templating is done client-side.
[16:55:44] <shoky> the docs pretty much say what you can do with it
[16:55:48] <m0dmd> after testing http://www.zurb.com/playground/javascript-annotation-plugin with my own image, i couldn't for the life of me, get it to position the points correctly in the smaller version
[16:55:57] <shoky> other than that its up to you.. or another library
[16:56:03] <bambams> Yeah, I was just hoping I was missing something.
[16:56:15] <bambams> Perhaps I should file a feature request or something..
[16:56:28] <shoky> I donno your exact requirements, but it should be easy to just load the tabs content dynamically..
[16:56:55] <shoky> a feature request requesting what? that they change the whole way the widget works?
[16:56:58] <bambams> Currently that is being done... All tabs are loaded all the time. Which means like 20 second delay for some users. :-X
[16:57:01] <shoky> so it'll suit your style?
[16:57:10] <bambams> Of course, tabs are probably being abused, but again it wasn't my design and it's out of my hands. :P
[16:57:13] <shoky> why 20 second delays?
[16:57:22] <bambams> shoky: 20 AJAX requets? :P
[16:57:23] <shoky> bad design is bad design
[16:57:26] <shoky> ^^
[16:57:41] <ML74> can someone help me with the update function of tinyscrollbar? i can't get it to update when i get the transition right.
[16:58:07] <bambams> Basically every tab is loaded through a Web service call, followed by client-side templating. So each tab is basically loaded from the beginning...
[16:58:23] <nattyp> can this be rewritten without the extra variable http://jsfiddle.net/RaWgM/
[17:04:43] <ML74> can anyone help me with a scrollbar? need to update it during a transition of content.
[17:05:00] <shoky> nattyp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RaWgM/1/
[17:05:50] <shoky> oh sorry
[17:05:53] <nattyp> thanks, trying it right now
[17:06:39] <shoky> nattyp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RaWgM/2/
[17:06:40] <shoky> better
[17:06:45] <shoky> and simpler
[17:06:57] <nattyp> so much to learn
[17:07:06] <shoky> just need to learn .map
[17:07:12] <shoky> you already know .each
[17:07:14] <shoky> almost there.
[17:07:18] <nattyp> cool
[17:07:25] <ML74> can anyone help me with a scrollbar? need to update it during a transition of content.
[17:07:41] <PerfM> Didn't you already ask that?
[17:07:58] <ML74> yeah, but it moved off the screen, so thought it'd be best to refresh memories ;)
[17:08:09] <PerfM> haha beauty
[17:08:43] <MistuhKurtz> So I have two groups of checkboxes in a form, one group has the name 'norcal_communities[]' and the other group is 'socal_communities[]'
[17:08:55] <MistuhKurtz> I need to make sure that at least one checkbox from either group has been checked
[17:09:05] <shoky> moved off screen? you mean you log all the joins/parts/quits?
[17:09:07] <shoky> EH.
[17:10:08] <PerfM> speaking of joins, how do I ignore a join from a certain user?
[17:10:12] <MistuhKurtz> http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?638723-jQuery-Validate-how-to-require-series-of-checkboxes-when-named-as-array looks great but I need either/or to be required
[17:10:20] <nattyp> shoky: do I need to get() in there before the join?
[17:10:22] <Krinkle> MistuhKurtz: Do the verification server side first, so that if you submit it wrong it will show the same form again but with an error message
[17:10:39] <Krinkle> MistuhKurtz: If you got that working, then you can make it with javascript that it'll validate without having to go to the server first
[17:10:46] <shoky> nattyp oh, maybe..
[17:10:47] <Krinkle> a simple event listener and a counter could do
[17:10:54] <shoky> nattyp i didnt try running it sry
[17:11:21] <MistuhKurtz> thank you Krinkle. I'm already using jquery validate for the rest of the form
[17:11:51] <MistuhKurtz> perhaps I could make sure count() > 0 in the submitHandler?
[17:11:58] <Krinkle> MistuhKurtz: Just so you know, validation in javascript is not validation, it is convenience for the user because it is faster than having to submit first
[17:12:11] <Krinkle> MistuhKurtz: But you must do it on the server side as well
[17:12:15] <MistuhKurtz> yes I realize that :)
[17:12:22] <Krinkle> ok

[17:47:20] <shoky> techouse
[17:47:30] <shoky> you need <a> tags

[17:48:02] <bot-t> techouse, .wrap() - Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[17:48:17] <shoky> because the docs say:

[17:53:20] <shoky> techouse i cant help you if i dont know the docs you are using
[17:55:09] <techouse> :/
[17:57:11] <shoky> lets all help techouse guess the wrong ways to use plugins
[17:57:19] <shoky> guessing is the way to go, for sure
[17:57:43] <mdhopkins> i've updated my gist with the HTML that the query is supposed to observe: https://gist.github.com/a6c9b265cca28ad6aa20
[17:57:50] <mdhopkins> that the query*
[17:57:57] <mdhopkins> jquery* stupid autocorrect. :(
[17:59:16] <nomad111> hi all, i am looking at the desktop version of a site on an iPhone (no mobile version available) and I'm using jQuery UI to create dialogs. The problem is that dialogs are popping up in the centre of the document rather than the viewport is there a work to fix this quickly? Should i just do some coordinate calculations before i show the dialog or can jQuery UI handle that for me?
[18:00:05] <nomad111> way*
[18:02:52] <mdhopkins> fixed my issue up above. forget the function() {. <--- idiot.
[18:10:34] <techouse> shoky: figured it out
[18:10:46] <techouse> was simpler than i thought
[18:11:08] <b-lew> why is this http://pastie.org/3801577 not working on this link? http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/#home_contact
[18:15:19] <b-lew> I must not be calling the div properly
[18:17:18] <Wilornel> Guys, I would like to know how to get the reponse from a server when using the .ajax function?
[18:17:29] <techouse> shoky: i was looking for this $.fancybox(myJSelement, {fb options,...})
[18:18:50] <shoky> any special reason you're not using jquery for it?
[18:19:00] <shoky> you have it loaded...
[18:21:29] <Wilornel> How is the information sent back from the sever called?
[18:21:34] <Wilornel> when you do .ajax()..
[18:23:58] <shoky> whatever you call it in your callback
[18:24:18] <Wilornel> Oh no not this....
[18:24:23] <shoky> ?
[18:24:30] <Wilornel> what the hell is a callback?
[18:24:57] <shoky> a function that gets called , in this case by jquery, when the ajax call is done
[18:25:12] <Wilornel> Also, consider the first exmaple from the examples section: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/    Is "msg" the response from the server?
[18:25:14] <shoky> you supply this function in the .ajax call
[18:25:23] <shoky> or with deferreds methods
[18:25:45] <shoky> yes
[18:25:48] <shoky> msg
[18:25:48] <Wilornel> is it this a callback? done(function( msg ) {
[18:25:48] <Wilornel>   alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );
[18:26:00] <shoky> function( msg ) { ... }
[18:26:02] <shoky> that's the callback
[18:26:04] <Wilornel> yeah
[18:26:08] <frontendloader> http://jsfiddle.net/77Jdw/5/ why's this returning a blank object and not the echo'd json?
[18:26:13] <Wilornel> I see
[18:26:17] <Wilornel> like everything after the dot
[18:26:25] <shoky> what dot
[18:26:34] <Wilornel> .done
[18:26:36] <Wilornel> (function
[18:26:39] <Wilornel> oh ok nvm
[18:26:49] <shoky> .done takes the callback as its argument
[18:27:14] <Wilornel> In the first example ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1152692/jquery-ajax-get-responsetext-from-http-url ) the callback would be the function after "success:" ?
[18:27:53] <Wilornel> right?
[18:28:11] <shoky> yes
[18:28:15] <Wilornel> Ok
[18:28:17] <dschuett> I am having issues with my JSON: this works: http://pastie.org/3801607 This doesn't: http://pastie.org/3801604 anyone care to take a stab on why the one works and the other doesnt?
[18:28:30] <Wilornel> But how the jQuery knows that the variable you call in your callback is the responseText?
[18:28:42] <shoky> Wilornel but dont do async:false like that example shows
[18:28:53] <shoky> Wilornel you name that variable
[18:29:00] <shoky> when you define the callback
[18:29:06] <shoky> just like you name an arguemnt when making a new function
[18:29:23] <Wilornel> But how does he know that this variable is associated to the responseText?
[18:29:24] <shoky> jquery passes the data as the first argument to the callback, it doesnt care what you call it
[18:29:28] <shoky> ^^
[18:29:43] <Wilornel> ohhh ok lol :P
[18:29:46] <Wilornel> but wait
[18:30:25] <Blaster> hey guys I'm trying to make kind of a slideshow where my first Slide (called .splashWrapper) slides to the left at the exact same time the second one slides beside it, but this code I wrote doesn't seem to work right.  Any advice?
[18:30:26] <Blaster> $('.splashWrapper.one').animate({left:-2000},{duration:1500,queue:false});
[18:30:26] <Blaster> $('.splashWrapper.two').css({right:2000}).animate({right:0},{duration:1500,queue:false});
[18:30:27] <Wilornel> would this be more correct? : jquery passes the data as the first argument to the callback OF THE .ajax() function, it doesnt care what you call it
[18:30:50] <shoky> Wilornel what?
[18:30:54] <shoky> no
[18:31:21] <shoky> oh sorry
[18:31:29] <shoky> to the callback of the .ajax() function
[18:31:30] <shoky> that's right
[18:31:33] <Wilornel> oh ok
[18:31:38] <Wilornel> I think I get it
[18:31:39] <Wilornel> :P
[18:31:41] <shoky> ;P
[18:31:58] <b-lew> shoky i was wondering if you could help me trouble shoot something ?
[18:32:06] <shoky> not only does it not care what you call it, in the simplest cases you would make it anonymous
[18:32:11] <shoky> like in the examples
[18:32:31] <Wilornel> so in the jquery.js file its just programmd this way that the first variable of the first( can there be more callbacks than one? ) callback of an .ajax() function is the responseText
[18:32:32] <shoky> b-lew only if it doesn thave to do with marginsssssssssssssssssssssssss
[18:32:47] <Wilornel> But in the examples they call it msg or responseText
[18:33:00] <shoky> Wilornel . read the whole docs page
[18:33:05] <shoky> not just some examples
[18:33:09] <shoky> dont do guesswork
[18:33:37] <Wilornel> Alright well thanks alot :P
[18:33:42] <shoky> np
[18:36:33] <shoky> Blaster, see ?demo
[18:36:34] <bot-t> Blaster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:36:52] <shoky> why the queue:false ?
[18:37:43] <Blaster> i read that queue:false makes it so 2 animations can occur at once?
[18:38:42] <shoky> on the same element, i think
[18:39:11] <shoky> animations on different elements should be simultaneous by default
[18:39:16] <Blaster> oh i see
[18:39:26] <Blaster> im going to try a different approach anyhow
[18:39:52] <shoky> kay
[18:44:37] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/services/services-compare hello guys
[18:44:48] <Parhs> does anyone know why this fails at IE7 ?
[18:44:59] <Parhs> clicking the boxes at right sidebar
[18:45:01] <Parhs> after a while
[18:45:13] <Parhs> i tried debug but it is strange
[18:53:25] <Parhs> it seems that attr
[18:53:26] <Parhs> doesnt work
[19:01:19] <resting> is there any way to break out of .each()?
[19:01:37] <resting> say when a condition is met?
[19:02:11] <Blaster> return ?
[19:03:45] <resting> only break out of that loopâ€¦not the function
[19:05:28] <Blaster> The doc page says: You can use 'return' to break out of each() loops early.
[19:05:38] <jwg2s> hey, can you use animate to change an attribute?
[19:05:41] <jwg2s> like img src
[19:06:13] <resting> Blaster: ooâ€¦ok i'll try tat..tkz
[19:07:29] <Blaster> jwg2s: Animate is to change CSS values.  To change img src use .attr
[19:07:44] <jwg2s> can i gradually change .attr?
[19:07:55] <Blaster> You want to fade an image out or something?
[19:08:02] <jwg2s> yeah
[19:08:09] <jwg2s> just fade in / out on hover
[19:08:36] <Blaster> $(elem).fadeOut(1500,function() { $(this).attr('src','newimg.png'); $(this).fadeIn() });
[19:08:41] <DEADB33F> Is there an quivalent to the :empty selector, but ignoring text nodes?
[19:08:45] <Blaster> something like that I think, jwg2s
[19:09:00] <DEADB33F> *equivalent
[19:09:27] <jwg2s> can you do a fadein without a fadeout?
[19:09:50] <Blaster> Yes, see the code I just gave you fades the image out, and then has a callback function which fades it back in after changing the img src.
[19:10:51] <b2__> I have a sortable which has has data dynamically managed (ajax). If I start a drag, and during the drag the source was removed immediately stop()ing the drag.
[19:10:51] <b2__> I I want the sort to continue. I tried to use the helper: 'clone' ... but didn't help ... any pointers ???
[19:11:20] <Blaster> b2__: ?demo
[19:11:44] <Blaster> see ?demo
[19:11:45] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:12:16] <b2__> ok ... i'll set it and get back ... thanks
[19:12:50] <jwg2s> Blaster: right, but that fades to white and then replaces the image
[19:12:59] <jwg2s> any way i can just fade straight to new image?
[19:13:15] <jwg2s> http://24.125.42.135/ service link
[19:13:58] <Blaster> jwg2s: Not that I know of, but you might find something if you do some searching
[19:14:34] <Blaster> Another way might be to preload the 2nd image either with javascript or with another hidden img tag. Fade out the original, then fade in the new.
[19:15:05] <jwg2s> Blaster: thanks, yeah i've been looking for a while now.  i'm gonna keep looking i guess, figured this was a pretty common issue but haven't found a tutorial that works well
[19:15:22] <Blaster> place the next image behind the current one, and fadeOut the current one so that it looks like as though it is fading into the next image.
[19:16:40] <jwg2s> ah good idea
[19:30:18] <jstout24> how can i make a jquery ui dialog stacks have an offset?
[19:30:36] <jstout24> it opens up directly over it.. i'd like to make my dialogs clickable and "focusable"
[19:32:35] <nattyp> how to filter on multiple attributes?
[19:37:52] <RPkS> Could someone PLEASE take mercy on me and help figure out a problem? I'm sure it's an easy thing to fix, but it has me stumped.
[19:37:57] <ihnru> what options should i use to minify jquery myself? http://refresh-sf.com/yui/
[19:38:36] <imsky> it's already minified ihnru
[19:38:41] <imsky> RPkS: what's your problem
[19:38:51] <ihnru> imsky: i know but...
[19:39:11] <ihnru> no, threre's a combined version with requirejs and it doesn't provide a minified ver.
[19:39:22] <ihnru> idk if its just the two unminified libs concatenated into a single file, so i'm minifying it myself.
[19:39:44] <RPkS> imsky: I added a button that uses toggle and I had it working, but then I tried to add another button and borrow the coding, but I've gotten things confused.
[19:39:56] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/cellphone-recon-usb-surveillance-tool
[19:40:25] <RPkS> The Returns and Shipping buttons have dropdown windows, but they aren't opening
[19:40:57] <imsky> sure, are you preventing default actions?
[19:41:25] <RPkS> Iimsky: I'm too confused to understand
[19:41:36] <abjorn> oh lawd
[19:41:43] <abjorn> arne't we all, RPkS
[19:41:44] <abjorn> aren't we all
[19:41:46] <imsky> ok on your button links, do you have some click handlers, RPkS
[19:42:30] <RPkS> Let me throw the script into a pastebin
[19:43:17] <dualcore> ajpiano: i just wanted to remind you that you are awesome
[19:43:17] <Guest23367> can anyone help me with this code http://jsfiddle.net/FwZyx/ i want it to specify on the object and not effect anything else on the page
[19:43:22] <dualcore> in case you forgot
[19:43:55] <RPkS> imsky: http://pastebin.com/QRbiJ7in
[19:44:10] <RPkS> I put a little above it and below it
[19:44:26] <RPkS> just in case that holds some clues
[19:44:52] <imsky> ok so line 41
[19:44:59] <imsky> you have event.stopPropagation();;
[19:45:03] <imsky> but there's no event variable
[19:45:11] <imsky> and you're not using preventDefault
[19:45:35] <imsky> actually wait
[19:45:41] <imsky> you are, you're doing "return false" at the end
[19:46:26] <RPkS> Well the idea was to have the little window that open with content close if you clicked anywhere but the window
[19:46:32] <imsky> but then you're using a global variable inside a callback
[19:46:43] <imsky> where no such global exists
[19:46:50] <RPkS> http://pastebin.com/BLC7pdKt
[19:47:03] <imsky> yep i have the site open
[19:47:07] <RPkS> That's from my product.tpl file
[19:47:59] <RPkS> imsky: I hate to admit that I'm over my head, but maybe you can help me fix the jumble I have.
[19:48:23] <imsky> RPkS: sure, replace your click handler for shipping with this: $("a.button-ship").click(function(e){ $(".blue-ship").slideToggle(); e.preventDefault();})
[19:48:49] <RPkS> oh boy ...let me see if I can find the right line to replace
[19:48:58] <imsky> 41-49 in the pastebin
[19:52:30] <RPkS> Hmmm so kill all of the stopPropagation stuff?
[19:52:50] <imsky> uhh yeah
[19:52:55] <RPkS> You saw that I have 2 groups of the sxript
[19:53:03] <imsky> sure did
[19:53:18] <RPkS> does it matter which lines are where?
[19:53:40] <imsky> ok you see the block that starts with $("a.button-ship")
[19:53:45] <imsky> take the whole thing out
[19:56:49] <RPkS> imsky: this is what I have now http://pastebin.com/DjqyFMEG
[19:57:07] <imsky> sure, should probably work
[19:57:42] <RPkS> Nope I have a jumble
[19:58:07] <merlin1991> I'm currantly headdesking hard, I want to align a span with an icon from jquery-ui to the right
[19:58:19] <imsky> RPkS: i'm pming you
[19:58:32] <merlin1991> tried to embed it in a div and set that div to text-align:right but that only creates bs
[19:59:03] <imsky> lol text-align:right
[19:59:07] <imsky> were you born in 1991?
[19:59:15] <Acrack> hello
[19:59:32] <ihnru> anyone in here familiar with requirejs?
[20:00:41] <shoky> ?ask
[20:00:42] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:01:34] <ihnru> ok, well requirejs-jquery appears to expect files to end in .js
[20:02:05] <ihnru> my js files are dynamically generated by http://site/file.php?jq
[20:02:44] <ihnru> i've very confused, tryiing to integrate require-jq into my site.
[20:02:58] <ihnru> if anyone could help me get through the confusion i would appreciate it.
[20:03:24] <Acrack> can somebody tell me why my mouseover mouseout is working with normal html and not with javascript code please ? here is the little code : http://pastie.org/3802056
[20:03:26] <ihnru> the more i can consolidate the files the better.
[20:04:25] <Acrack> ?
[20:05:36] <imsky> Acrack: onmouseover?
[20:06:11] <Acrack> its not good ?
[20:06:17] <imsky> you're in #jquery
[20:06:29] <imsky> we use .on here
[20:06:31] <Acrack> oh so its just mouseover if i remember well ?
[20:06:46] <Acrack> ?
[20:06:57] <imsky> nah your inline should theoretically work
[20:07:02] <imsky> but this
[20:07:04] <imsky> onmouseover="this.src="{{ asset("images/good-answer.png") }}""
[20:07:09] <imsky> this is just not going to cut it
[20:07:13] <Acrack> instead of this
[20:07:17] <Acrack> what should i put ?
[20:07:22] <imsky> look at the quotes
[20:07:25] <imsky> you have doubles inside doubles
[20:07:48] <shoky> ihnru
[20:07:55] <Acrack> onmouseover="this.src='{{ asset("images/good-answer.png") }}'"
[20:08:00] <Acrack> i should put it like this ?
[20:08:01] <shoky> However, if the dependency name has one of the following properties, it is treated as a regular file path, like something that was passed to a <script src=""> tag:
[20:08:04] <shoky> Ends in ".js".
[20:08:07] <shoky> Starts with a "/".
[20:08:10] <shoky> Contains an URL protocol, like "http:" or "https:".
[20:08:16] <imsky> Acrack: close
[20:08:24] <Acrack> xD
[20:08:26] <imsky> you need to escape every quote that's inside another quote
[20:08:33] <imsky> also...just don't use this
[20:08:41] <imsky> because you're basically doing image rollovers
[20:08:46] <imsky> and those are now done with css
[20:08:55] <imsky> put it another way, you're coding like it's 2002
[20:09:07] <Acrack> onmouseover="this.src=\"{{ asset(\"images/good-answer.png\") }}\""
[20:09:16] <Acrack> xD
[20:09:46] <imsky> yeah i guess, but you're using templating
[20:09:52] <imsky> so who knows what the real output string is
[20:09:55] <Acrack> lemme try to do it in css ^^
[20:10:14] <ihnru> shoky: so could i just have         <script data-main="/file.php?main" src="/file?requirejquery"></script>
[20:10:21] <shoky> huh
[20:10:27] <ihnru> shoky: ?
[20:10:31] <shoky> im not talking about the <script> tag
[20:10:33] <ihnru> is that a yes?
[20:10:36] <shoky> you were asking about the require() call
[20:10:56] <ihnru> shoky: well i'm talking about the whole implementation process step by step.
[20:10:56] <shoky> i think.
[20:11:10] <shoky> what are you saying about it
[20:12:10] <shoky> i can't help you with best practices using requirejs coz i don't use it
[20:12:25] <shoky> but i can read docs
[20:12:34] <ihnru> shoky: i'm just gonna walk you through my whole app if that's alright with you... it's very short, i need to include jquery, a jq plugin, and a line that calls on the plugin
[20:12:51] <ihnru> shoky: the docs are confusing as hell.
[20:12:58] <shoky> ok. you sure you wanna use requirejs for that?
[20:13:02] <ihnru> i don't need best practices, only sufficient ones.
[20:13:27] <shoky> GODDAMN this mosquito is annoying me
[20:13:34] <coldhead> ?csb
[20:13:34] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[20:13:36] <shoky> (not you)
[20:13:39] <ihnru> shoky: yup.  basically i need there to be only one line of source in the htmldoc.
[20:13:45] <shoky> sorry, it fucken itchesjfsdoia
[20:13:45] <ihnru> shoky: lol ;)
[20:13:45] <shoky> oo
[20:14:01] <ihnru> so its not messy for other people to paste into their webpages.
[20:14:10] <shoky> ihnru ok so you can put any url you want in a <script> tag
[20:14:21] <ihnru> i'm writing instructions to embed my app.
[20:14:27] <shoky> you can have that script call require()
[20:14:35] <shoky> to load anything you need like jq, jqplugin,etc
[20:14:44] <ihnru> shoky: wait wait wait, slow up a second.
[20:14:48] <shoky> k
[20:15:13] <dododido> hey guys
[20:15:33] <ihnru> shoky: so i start with         <script data-main="/file.php?main" src="/file?requirejquery"></script>
[20:15:40] <dododido> can you check out http://jsfiddle.net/f776z/ and tell me why the code is affecting other codes on the page
[20:15:44] <ihnru> dododido: howdy.
[20:15:58] <shoky> ihnru if that's the correct url, sure
[20:16:09] <ihnru> shoky: then in ?main, i have:
[20:16:09] <dododido> also in chrome i did inspect element and cosole
[20:16:17] <dododido> this shows up
[20:16:18] <dododido> Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of script found within request. 6event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[20:16:50] <khmer> uh oh you quined
[20:16:54] <khmer> wuone?
[20:17:15] <dododido> who me?
[20:18:08] <jpk> Question: I have a form with just a file input and a submit button, and I want to disable the submit button until the file input has a file picked.  The part I'm having trouble with is detecting when the file field gets filled.  What's the best way to do that?
[20:18:44] <khmer> dododido: jsfiddle doesn't work like that
[20:19:00] <ihnru> shoky: http://pastebin.com/qzBpgzRu is whats in ?main
[20:19:31] <ihnru> how's that look?
[20:19:50] <shoky> fine i think
[20:19:57] <dododido> khmer i fixed it up sorry http://jsfiddle.net/f776z/1/
[20:20:26] <Goopyo> Q: Using replace with how can I take a html snippet and replace part of it with a varaible?
[20:21:39] <ihnru> shoky: wait i think i got somethin wrong.
[20:21:41] <ihnru> in there.
[20:22:02] <ihnru> where does .autoheight() come from?
[20:22:04] <coldhead> ?eval var aids = 'lol aids'; 'foo XXX foo'.replace(/XXX/, aids);
[20:22:06] <bot-t> coldhead: "foo lol aids foo"
[20:22:39] <shoky> ihnru from the plugin?
[20:22:55] <ihnru> http://pastebin.com/XaDRd7fp
[20:24:09] <dododido> anyone got anythjing?
[20:24:13] <shoky> so .iframeAutoheight() i guess?
[20:24:25] <shoky> .iframeAutoHeight()
[20:24:57] <ihnru> that's ?autoheight
[20:25:11] <ihnru> $.fn.alpha = function() {     return this.append('<p>Alpha is Go!</p>'); };
[20:25:16] <ihnru> that's the sample/template
[20:25:28] <shoky> wat.
[20:26:11] <coldhead> ah LukeNukem
[20:26:15] <coldhead> thank god you're here
[20:26:15] <ihnru> shoky: this is what i'm starting from: https://github.com/jrburke/require-jquery/tree/master/jquery-require-sample/webapp
[20:26:33] <shoky> ok..
[20:27:04] <coldhead> how's project imgur working out, LukeNukem ?
[20:27:26] <ihnru> mind if we switch to pms so we don't have to pick out our messages to each other?
[20:27:34] <shoky> go ahead
[20:27:38] <ihnru> or else wanna /join #rjq ?
[20:27:51] <shoky> pm's fine
[20:28:15] <dododido> can anyone check out http://jsfiddle.net/f776z/1/ and tell me why the code is affecting other codes on the page
[20:29:39] <coldhead> dododido: the only things i can see it effecting are that you're binding to ALL buttons and showing ALL <p>s
[20:29:55] <coldhead> you might also be in trouble if you already have jQuery loaded
[20:30:05] <coldhead> you'll overwrite it and any plugins you may have loaded
[20:30:50] <LukeNukem> coldhead, im now into maybe the hardest phase of it
[20:30:53] <LukeNukem> nodejs and socket.io
[20:32:09] <coldhead> uh oh
[20:32:13] <coldhead> good luck man
[20:32:46] <coldhead> its good for your CV
[20:40:31] <LukeNukem> yea
[20:40:52] <LukeNukem> coldhead, i am reading on it but a lot of new terms like throughput
[20:41:18] <LukeNukem> im not even sure what the real advantages of node.js because i cant understand these terms and i have no time to go through them all, maybe i will pick it up on the way
[20:42:23] <coldhead> LukeNukem: the main advantage is not having to learn another language
[20:42:46] <coldhead> whatever other mysterious benefits you enjoy will become apparent with time
[20:46:09] <Acrack> i have a list of many links how to make them different to each other ? for exemple i want an action to start if i click on one
[20:46:31] <imsky> how are they different
[20:47:09] <Acrack> ?
[20:47:25] <dododido> cold head sorry i was afk mind if we pm?
[20:48:20] <coldhead> i'd prefer if we just talked here
[20:48:38] <coldhead> so that better minds may point out various mistakes
[20:48:50] <coldhead> and stop me if i start making racist remarks about gypsies
[20:48:59] <dododido> lol ok
[20:49:00] <dododido> nws
[20:49:11] <Acrack> imsky: i have a foreach generating me a list of links, and when i click to one of them i want an action to start
[20:49:19] <imsky> what action
[20:49:29] <Acrack> click action
[20:49:44] <Acrack> in my case :
[20:50:04] <Acrack> there is many answers, when you click on "this is the good answer link" the action start
[20:50:22] <billygalbreath> i'm 99% this is impossible, but I'll ask anyways. Is there any known way to force hide the status bar so it doesnt show all the images I'm preloading in the background?
[20:50:28] <Acrack> actually all links have id="good-answer"
[20:50:30] <dododido> so i have 2 jquery objects on my page :shadowbox and .show()  and when you click on show it affects everything
[20:51:46] <Acrack> imsky: did you understand me ? ^^
[20:51:57] <Dr-Bombay> so... I don't suppose you have an example on jsfiddle that actually demonstrates the problem rather than one that doesnt
[20:51:57] <imsky> oh yeah
[20:52:01] <imsky> all links with id good-answer
[20:52:13] <Dr-Bombay> because the one that doesn't isn't all that helpful
[20:52:17] <coldhead> dododido: so you need to be more specific. give the p you want to show an id like id="showthis" and then do $('#showthis').show()
[20:52:30] <Acrack> imsky: yep so im kinda stuck xD
[20:53:06] <imsky> Acrack: there's your first clue, stop using the same id for links
[20:53:37] <Acrack> give me all clues lol :p
[20:53:57] <billygalbreath> id is unique. class can be reused, though
[20:54:09] <dododido> does that look right?
[20:54:47] <coldhead> dododido: your actual code would explain it better than you are
[20:55:23] <Acrack> imsky: second clue please ?
[20:55:23] <dododido> loool im soo sorry
[20:55:24] <dododido> http://jsfiddle.net/f776z/2/
[20:55:36] <imsky> Acrack: write an .each
[20:56:33] <rburton-> How would an application share state between pages when using query mobile?
[20:56:58] <dododido> cold head does that look right?
[20:57:11] <coldhead> dododido: http://jsfiddle.net/f776z/3/
[20:57:18] <coldhead> very good
[20:57:23] <coldhead> i just did the same for the button
[20:57:30] <coldhead> and removed the unneeded show()
[20:58:08] <coldhead> also i clicked "tidy" which made it prettier
[20:58:58] <Acrack> imsky: i don't see the thing mate :s
[20:59:10] <imsky> Acrack: maybe post a jsfiddle?
[21:00:17] <Acrack> problem is that im using twig
[21:00:23] <dododido> wait how do you copy the code?
[21:02:13] <chrislabeard> for some reason I'm having some performance issues in IE9, I'm not sure if I'm doing it wrong or if its just IE9 the page it http://car.ideasbynature.org -- the part I'm talking about is when you hover over the middle boxes
[21:02:35] <imsky> lol twig
[21:02:37] <imsky> use smarty
[21:03:13] <dododido> COLD HEAD I THINK I FUCKING LOVE YOU
[21:03:22] <dododido> <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
[21:03:26] <dododido> no homo
[21:03:32] <tw2113> get a room anyway
[21:03:37] <coldhead> good work, dododido
[21:04:14] <imsky> get 2 rooms
[21:04:23] <shoky> get me one too
[21:04:29] <imsky> hump each other through the walls
[21:06:05] <Acrack> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/ im at this point
[21:06:15] <Acrack> how to make them different ?
[21:06:18] <imsky> gah alerts
[21:06:26] <imsky> different how
[21:07:03] <Acrack> $( "#good-answer" ).click(function(){alert('lol');});
[21:07:09] <Acrack> right now if i do this
[21:07:30] <Acrack> all div with id good-answer will alert lol if i click on one of them
[21:07:35] <imsky> yes
[21:07:41] <imsky> because they all have the id of good-answer
[21:08:03] <Acrack> how to make them with different id ? like good-answer-1 etc..
[21:08:29] <imsky> give them different ids
[21:08:48] <Acrack> this is my question mate ^^
[21:08:50] <Acrack> how ?
[21:08:54] <jpk> Question: I have a form with just a file input and a submit button, and I want to disable the submit button until the file input has a file picked.  The part I'm having trouble with is detecting when the file field gets filled.  What's the best way to do that?
[21:09:09] <imsky> i don't get your question
[21:09:15] <imsky> you can either change them in the html source
[21:09:21] <imsky> or through js
[21:09:26] <Acrack> but they are generated
[21:09:30] <imsky> yeah ok
[21:09:32] <imsky> so?
[21:09:36] <Acrack> i could have like 200 links
[21:09:46] <imsky> so call them "good-link-182"
[21:09:46] <Acrack> so how to change them ?
[21:09:56] <Acrack> this is where im stuck
[21:09:57] <imsky> and give them a class of "good-link"
[21:10:03] <imsky> that sounds like a php question
[21:10:07] <LukeNukem> coldhead, progress, just created a new http server :}
[21:10:24] <Acrack> hummm
[21:10:32] <coldhead> that's the main feature of node as far as i know!
[21:10:34] <coldhead> good work!
[21:10:38] <coldhead> achievement unlatched
[21:10:40] <coldhead> or w/e
[21:10:41] <imsky> coldhead y u so cynical
[21:11:12] <LukeNukem> lol
[21:11:13] <LukeNukem> :}
[21:11:20] <Acrack> imsky: if i do onclick="smth...." it should work no ?
[21:11:26] <imsky> you're already using jquery
[21:11:30] <imsky> why are you doing onclicks
[21:11:42] <Acrack> its .click() on jquery
[21:12:00] <LukeNukem> acidjazz, bind it with on
[21:12:00] <Acrack> its same function right ?
[21:12:04] <LukeNukem> bind click event with on
[21:12:10] <imsky> Acrack: no
[21:12:22] <Acrack> :'(
[21:12:25] <billygalbreath> Acrack, I cant tell what you are trying to do. was going to help, but... you need to better explain yourself. you talk about generating links in a for loop, but I see no for loop in your jsfiddle..
[21:12:35] <LukeNukem> $("#buttonid").on("click", function(e){ console.log("Clicked");  });
[21:12:40] <imsky> because he's doing it in a php template
[21:12:42] <imsky> using twig
[21:12:42] <coldhead> that IS the point of it, imsky. BILLIONS OF CALLBACKS ALL ASYNCHRONOUS
[21:12:55] <imsky> coldhead: you're killing unicorns and ponies
[21:12:57] <LukeNukem> coldhead, define asynchronous as quick and tiny as you can
[21:12:58] <Acrack> yea sorry for not explaining better
[21:12:59] <imsky> and dreams and hopes
[21:13:14] <coldhead> LukeNukem: waiting for no one and no one waitin for it
[21:13:20] <LukeNukem> realtime? ;s
[21:13:21] <Acrack> and like imsky said im generating them with a loop with template engine twig
[21:13:22] <imsky> lol "billions of callbacks" = jquery to a T
[21:13:22] <LukeNukem> time and tide?
[21:13:26] <ihnru> http://lwdev.fr.am/shokyrocks/embed.html
[21:13:29] <Cork> jpk: check .val() on the input field, it should include the filename (not path)
[21:13:34] <coldhead> A WAVE UPON THE SAND
[21:13:41] <imsky> A WAVE I SAY
[21:13:49] <ihnru> any idea why the above doesn't autoresize to fir content?
[21:13:50] <LukeNukem> Argh captain jack sparrow
[21:13:59] <coldhead> we can have a conversation in realtime but that's different to us speaking over the top of each other
[21:14:12] <imsky> we can do it asynchronously too
[21:14:20] <imsky> you say something, and i go get a sandwich and come back and reply
[21:14:25] <chrislabeard> is there something I'm doing wrong on these animations for it to be really buggy in IE9 -- http://car.ideasbynature.org/
[21:14:25] <imsky> callbaxx
[21:14:39] <coldhead> but if i talk real quiet and you're in the next room you won't hear me
[21:14:45] <coldhead> and i might talk smack about you
[21:14:52] <imsky> oh that's meteor.js
[21:14:55] <imsky> he's very hot right now
[21:14:56] <coldhead> ahahahahha
[21:15:04] * imsky dat hansel
[21:15:47] <Acrack> can you tell me how i can give 3 different ids to the 3 following links please ? http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/ they are already generated with template engine twig
[21:16:01] <imsky> the answer lies
[21:16:05] <imsky> within the twig documentation
[21:16:27] <Acrack> so we can't do it with jquery ?
[21:16:31] <bwain> anyone know what i'm doing wrong here with the email attribute?
[21:16:32] <bwain> http://jsfiddle.net/vtHGc/5/
[21:16:47] <imsky> Acrack: no
[21:16:57] <Acrack> :'( ok
[21:17:01] <bwain> it still thinks email is required
[21:17:07] <imsky> email="return false;"
[21:17:09] <imsky> wat
[21:17:09] <Cork> Acrack: do you want the links in the tag or separat?=
[21:17:11] <Acrack> thanks anyway mate
[21:17:12] <Cork> *?
[21:17:12] <bwain> Validation methods with parameters can be specified as attributes (recommended)
[21:17:23] <bwain> from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules
[21:17:27] <imsky> DDDDDD:
[21:17:39] <imsky> i think they mean functions
[21:17:49] <imsky> because return false; is a throwback to MM_preloadImages days
[21:18:17] <Cork> Acrack?
[21:18:22] <Acrack> Cork : i want them to have different ids for exemple "good-answer-1", "good-answer-2"
[21:18:22] <Acrack> etc
[21:18:38] <bwain> i changed it to this and it still doesnt work
[21:18:38] <bwain> http://jsfiddle.net/vtHGc/7/
[21:18:41] <imsky> Acrack: reading twig docs would probably help
[21:19:03] <Acrack> i ll just waiting cork i see hope XD
[21:19:10] <Acrack> lol
[21:19:46] <Cork> Acrack: and whats suppose to set the different id's?
[21:19:59] <Cork> you want js to fix up the broken html?
[21:20:43] <Acrack> oh i got an idea !!!!!!!!!
[21:20:43] <Acrack> xD
[21:21:05] <Cork> Acrack: btw don't use href="#"
[21:21:11] <Cork> use spans if you don't want a link
[21:22:32] <Acrack> im stupid all i had to do is : id="good-answer{{ answer.getId }}"
[21:22:41] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/8/
[21:22:44] <asher^> anyone know if theres a way to pass a list/array of ids to create a connected .sortable with?
[21:22:59] <bwain> so if i say <input type="text" class="required" email="foo();" name="myname" />, where foo is just a fn that returns false, it still checks f or emaisl
[21:23:12] <Acrack> its ok cork thanks for help
[21:23:17] <Acrack> imsky: thanks ^^
[21:23:25] <Acrack> u were right twig did it after all
[21:23:25] <imsky> Acrack: sure thing buddy
[21:23:31] <imsky> yes good old twig
[21:23:32] <Cork> Acrack: didn't really help with your question
[21:23:34] <imsky> but seriously use smarty
[21:23:51] <Acrack> im using symfony2 wich use twig
[21:23:51] <Cork> Acrack: just tried to sugest better solutions
[21:23:57] <imsky> symfony DDDD:
[21:24:00] <Acrack> thanks for your time Cork ^^
[21:24:03] <imsky> lol i salute you acrack
[21:24:07] <imsky> is symfony2 hard?
[21:24:09] <bwain> i thought when they said Validation methods with parameters can be specified as attributes (recommended), they meant you could have an attr like email="shouldICheckEmail()"
[21:24:19] <bwain> am i misunderstanding that
[21:24:29] <Acrack> imsky: im big noob with php, and thanks to symfony i can make modules etc very fast
[21:24:35] <Acrack> imsky: i love it...
[21:24:48] <imsky> i'm not a noob and i can never get started with frameworks. either symfony or codeigniter
[21:24:58] <imsky> they're like giant spaceships built by aliens
[21:24:59] <Acrack> serisouly go with sf ^^
[21:25:05] <wookiehangover> bwain: that's really, really not how validation works
[21:25:18] <Acrack> imsky: its like symfony build your site for you lol
[21:25:29] <bwain> wookiehangover: what do you mean
[21:25:33] <imsky> Acrack: hmm is it fast though? the reason i say use smarty is because of speed
[21:26:06] <wookiehangover> bwain: eh, jsut noticed you're using a plugin for it
[21:26:11] <wookiehangover> I know not of those things
[21:26:16] <bwain> oh yea jquery validation
[21:26:20] <Acrack> imsky: i didn't try live but, from what i heard its 2x faster than zend, and 2x faster than previous version of symfony wich was 1.4
[21:26:28] <wookiehangover> but of handling form validation sans plugin without heartache, that I know how to do
[21:26:33] <imsky> cool. so it's finally out of beta, acrack?
[21:26:42] <Acrack> sf2 ? yea for a long time lol
[21:26:50] <imsky> like i said, aliens
[21:26:54] <Acrack> xD
[21:27:01] <bwain> anyone familair with jquery validate?
[21:27:15] <Acrack> its hard to start it but there is many tutorials in french
[21:27:21] <Acrack> so its cool
[21:27:22] <imsky> are you french?
[21:27:24] <Acrack> y
[21:27:29] <imsky> dammit
[21:27:32] <Acrack> why ?
[21:27:33] <Acrack> xD
[21:27:36] <imsky> you have an advantage
[21:27:41] <imsky> since fabien is french too
[21:27:52] <Acrack> yea big one, cause of tutorials
[21:28:00] * imsky starts learning french
[21:28:04] <Acrack> i got a friend on my team hating symfony
[21:28:16] <Acrack> cause he can't find good english tutos for beginers
[21:28:17] <bwain> http://jsfiddle.net/vtHGc/8/ not sure why email is being checked there. jquery validate says that you can speicfy validators like that
[21:28:20] <LukeNukem> Acrack, like Bethovens symphony?
[21:28:27] <imsky> Acrack: that's probably why i never got a good start with it
[21:28:28] <Acrack> ya
[21:28:33] <billygalbreath> I asked this earlier, but its more active now.. I'm 99% certain this is impossible, but I'll ask anyways. Is there any known way to force hide the status bar so it doesnt show all the images I'm preloading in the background?
[21:28:33] <LukeNukem> BURN THAT MOTHERFUCKER
[21:28:44] <imsky> billygalbreath: no
[21:28:56] <imsky> back in the good olde days, you could totally futz with the browser
[21:29:02] <billygalbreath> bummer
[21:29:14] <LukeNukem> billygalbreath, what status bar are you talking aboot here?
[21:29:49] <billygalbreath> the only status bar on any browser. located at the bottom, telling the user what its currently doing... like loading images
[21:29:58] <LukeNukem> no you cant
[21:30:12] <billygalbreath> Chrome's sticks out like a sore thumb on my dark page, was hoping I could force it to disappear
[21:30:55] <billygalbreath> i was afraid ya'll were gonna say that - oh well - had to ask anyways :p

[21:44:17] <Cork> nexion: if the json fails to parse it will fail
[21:44:35] <Eviltwin> That is the most likely issue
[21:44:56] <bwain> anybody familair with jquery validate?
[21:45:12] <Cork> ?ask @ bwain
[21:45:13] <bot-t> bwain, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:45:41] <bwain> http://jsfiddle.net/vtHGc/8/ not sure why email is being checked there. jquery validate says that you can speicfy validators like that
[21:46:28] <Cork> that sounds highly inlikly
[21:46:33] <Cork> *unlikly
[21:46:42] <Stuffness> *unlikely
[21:46:44] <bwain> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules#.22add.22rules
[21:47:01] <bwain> "Validation methods with parameters can be specified as attributes (recommended)"
[21:48:00] <bwain> am i misunderstanding that
[21:50:21] <bwain> cork: i got disconnected. did you say something?
[21:50:56] <Cork> bwain: skimming through the source code
[21:51:08] <bwain> k thanks
[21:51:20] <Dr-Bombay> it could mean that you can specify validation rules in attributes, if they are defined attributes where code can be provided
[21:51:29] <Dr-Bombay> defined as attributes where...
[21:52:03] <Dr-Bombay> in other words, an event can run validation code just as well as it could run any other code
[21:52:17] <Cork> bwain: i THINK what they'r talking about is type="email"
[21:52:26] <Cork> but thats only me guessing
[21:52:45] <Cork> i can't find any code what so ever for executing attributes as functions though
[21:52:50] <firebalrog> no you are right
[21:53:05] <firebalrog> see examples
[21:53:20] <bwain> who's right? me?
[21:53:38] <bwain> i think i found something. look for "attributeRules: " in http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.9/jquery.validate.js
[21:53:39] <firebalrog> cork
[21:54:07] <Cork> bwain: thats the validator that validates the existance of attributes
[21:54:14] <Cork> that was the first thing i checked :)
[21:55:00] <bwain> ok. so what do you mena  is type="email"
[21:55:15] <Cork> replace type="text" with type="email"
[21:55:27] <bwain> but how do i specify the params then
[21:55:54] <Cork> there is a built in function to validate emails
[21:56:01] <Dr-Bombay> bah
[21:56:17] <Cork> if you want to overide that you need to give that to the validate function
[21:57:17] <tw2113> evening Cork
[21:57:27] <Cork> morning :)
[21:57:31] <tw2113> close enough
[21:57:45] <bwain> ah you know whati  ifgured it out
[21:58:10] <tw2113> *throws confetti*
[21:58:39] <bwain> i thought every validator method could take a callback fn or a var to check agaisnt
[21:58:41] <bwain> but its only required
[21:58:51] <bwain> the things they were tallking about are things like minlength, which need a param
[21:58:57] <bwain> so you can say minlength="2"
[21:59:02] <Cork> yup
[21:59:16] <bwain> but theres no way to specifcy a callback for anything but required
[21:59:16] <bwain> lame
[21:59:32] <Cork> why would you need a callback?
[21:59:53] <bwain> i want to check for email only if a checkbox is checked
[21:59:57] <bwain> or somethign along those lines
[22:00:07] <Cork> that should be doable
[22:00:15] <bwain> i can remove and add the check each time it's checked
[22:00:17] <bwain> this was just easier
[22:00:21] <bwain> if it worked
[22:00:21] <Cork> there was code for dependency
[22:00:22] <bwain> but it doesnt
[22:00:30] <Cork> didn't look closer into it though
[22:00:37] <bwain> i only ssee it for the required check
[22:00:40] <bwain> not any of the others
[22:00:58] <Cork> bwain: no not callbacks, but dependencies
[22:01:41] <bwain> yea. in http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#List_of_built-in_Validation_methods , the only dependency one i see is required
[22:04:11] <bwain> cork: did you see some other way to get a dependency check for email?
[22:07:11] <bwain> cork: gotta head out. thanks for the help
[22:07:14] <Cork> bwain: there is something in there
[22:07:19] <bwain> ah
[22:07:23] <bwain> what do you see?
[22:07:24] <Cork> but that plugin is way over complex
[22:07:32] <bwain> lol yea
[22:07:37] <Cork> val.depends
[22:07:47] <Cork> in normalizeRules
[22:08:01] <Cork> but you would basically have to read the entire plugin to tell what happens
[22:08:33] <bwain> yea. it's not worth it. i'll just do it without the html attrs
[22:08:36] <bwain> thanks
[22:08:38] <Cork> but ya, there is ways to do it
[22:09:15] <umhelpme> hey guys can anyone show me how to align some code in ie?
[22:09:23] <tw2113> css
[22:09:30] <Cork> align code??
[22:09:41] <umhelpme> align=center wont work
[22:09:42] <tw2113> what cork said too
[22:09:55] <umhelpme> <span class="centre"> wont work
[22:10:00] <Cork> ah css then
[22:10:07] <tw2113> the class alone won't do it
[22:10:11] <Cork> text-align: center
[22:10:21] <tw2113> you need to add .centre { text-align: center; } to your css
[22:10:51] <umhelpme> any idea what my css would look like?
[22:11:08] * Cork points at the line before yours
[22:11:23] * tw2113 wonders if umhelpme has never done css before
[22:11:34] <Cork> sounds like it
[22:12:27] <umhelpme> heres the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CA9ng/
[22:12:32] <Cork> umhelpme: sounds like you should take a detour past #css
[22:12:49] <umhelpme> im not so good with css
[22:12:52] <Cork> uh...
[22:12:59] <Cork> you have a span before your head...
[22:13:21] <Cork> thats invalid html
[22:13:24] <umhelpme> http://jsfiddle.net/CA9ng/1/
[22:13:28] <umhelpme> better
[22:13:32] <tw2113> http://htmldog.com/
[22:13:37] <Cork> no
[22:13:46] <umhelpme> no?
[22:14:16] <umhelpme> the point is it does what i want it to do in chrome but not in ie
[22:14:38] <tw2113> never though IE would do something more right than chrome
[22:14:48] <umhelpme> 66
[22:14:51] <umhelpme> ^^*
[22:15:23] <Cork> umhelpme: http://jsfiddle.net/CA9ng/3/
[22:15:36] <billygalbreath> http://jsfiddle.net/CA9ng/4/
[22:15:45] <Cork> umhelpme: you can't have html elements outside your body
[22:16:01] <Cork> only head and body is valid in the html tag
[22:16:43] <billygalbreath> nesting <- the thing I see newbs mess up with the most
[22:16:53] <billygalbreath> they just cant wrap their heads around it for some reason
[22:17:07] <tw2113> mine is too hard to bend
[22:17:15] <Cork> :)
[22:17:33] <tw2113> so usually people just beat me with a piple for awhile until they get a tuba
[22:17:42] <Acrack> how to select something like this : http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/ ?
[22:17:44] <tw2113> pile*
[22:17:46] <tw2113> fuck
[22:17:49] <tw2113> pipe
[22:17:50] <Acrack> how to select the "10" i mean
[22:18:23] <Cork> Acrack: your html is still invalid
[22:18:25] <billygalbreath> Acrack use console.log() rather than alert()
[22:18:27] <billygalbreath> please
[22:18:33] <Cork> Acrack: id's ar uniq
[22:18:42] <umhelpme> billygalbreath
[22:18:43] <Acrack> i use class ?
[22:18:49] <Cork> they CAN'T be the same on more then uno element
[22:18:49] <Cork> yes
[22:18:54] <umhelpme> billygalbreath: +10 internets for you
[22:18:55] <Acrack> oke
[22:19:13] <umhelpme> you got it
[22:19:46] <Cork> umhelpme: btw, why do you have the inline onclick when your doing somehting similar in the event listner?
[22:19:53] <Cork> opps sorry
[22:19:57] <Cork> Acrack: that was for you
[22:20:11] <umhelpme> fuck me cork i was like wtf
[22:20:11] <umhelpme> ?
[22:20:16] <Acrack> yea i forgot to delete it ^^
[22:20:17] <Acrack> sec
[22:20:37] <Acrack> here we go : http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/
[22:20:48] <Acrack> how to select the 10, in my code 10 is a var
[22:20:52] <billygalbreath> Acrack use console.log() rather than alert()
[22:20:53] <billygalbreath> please
[22:21:12] <Acrack> ????? why you always tell me about console log
[22:21:12] <Acrack> lol
[22:21:23] <Acrack> what am i doing wrong what are you talking about
[22:21:26] <billygalbreath> its less intrusive and anoying than alerts
[22:21:29] <beancurd> because alert makes baby shiva cry.
[22:21:46] <Acrack> where you can see that i use alert ?
[22:22:04] <Acrack> arf weird
[22:22:06] <beancurd> one advantage alert has over console.log is that it's easier to type though...
[22:22:36] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/20/
[22:22:46] <Acrack> here i dont use alert nor console :D
[22:23:05] <Cork> Acrack: have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/22/
[22:23:57] <fiasco> is there a reason this wouldn't work: http://paste.dollyfish.net.nz/44e56e
[22:24:05] <fiasco> I can't figure out why not
[22:24:13] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/24/ Cork this is the thingy
[22:24:21] <Acrack> how to select the "10" ?
[22:24:37] <Acrack> sorry im not used to jsfiddle yet so i pasted some wrong code earlier
[22:24:47] <Cork> Acrack: whats 10?
[22:24:52] <Cork> there is no 10 in the page
[22:25:11] <Acrack> <a class="good-answer-10" href="#"></a>
[22:25:13] <Acrack> lol
[22:25:18] <Acrack> this way im sure u see it hahaahaha
[22:25:39] <Cork> Acrack: use data-answer
[22:25:48] <Cork> in the example link i gave you
[22:26:17] <Cork> fiasco: script tags is executed out of context with html in jquery
[22:26:32] <Cork> fiasco: so if you expect it to document.write in the div it won't work
[22:26:40] <Acrack> Cork : what data answer will show ?
[22:26:46] <fiasco> Cork, what should I do instead?
[22:27:04] <Cork> fiasco: dom selectors and append/html/*
[22:27:22] <Cork> Acrack: it will show what you add in that attribute
[22:27:42] <Cork> it could be an url or what ever
[22:27:47] <Acrack> oh ok
[22:27:58] <Acrack> is this jquery ?
[22:28:06] <Acrack> if no is there a jquery way ?
[22:28:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/25/
[22:28:11] <fiasco> Cork, like this:http://paste.dollyfish.net.nz/fa9137?
[22:28:23] <Cork> Acrack: try the links in the html view
[22:28:34] <Cork> Acrack: its the most efficient way
[22:28:39] <Acrack> oki
[22:28:51] <Cork> Acrack: if it doesn't match what you need you need to explain what you need better
[22:29:02] <Acrack> k sec :p
[22:29:29] <Cork> fiasco: no, the script you load need to work with dom elements instead of document.write
[22:29:46] <Cork> fiasco: never expect scripts to work in a context
[22:30:12] <Cork> (document.write is a hack and script actually DON'T do that
[22:30:29] <fiasco> Cork, do you have an example? I don't quite understand what you mean, I'm not using document.write
[22:31:16] <Cork> fiasco: ok, so use $.getScript and have the id of the div as a parameter to it
[22:31:17] <Acrack> date-answerId="10" is it possible to get it with jquery way Cork ?
[22:31:21] <fiasco> Cork, oh I see, yes, the script I'm trying to load will call document.write. But before I can get there, I can't even get the thing to load
[22:31:31] <Cork> Acrack: sure
[22:31:39] <fiasco> Cork, thanks, I'll look into it
[22:31:43] <Cork> Acrack: its basically what i did
[22:31:58] <Cork> just a name change of the attribute
[22:32:14] <Cork> from data-answer to data-answerId
[22:32:19] <Cork> (data not date) ;)
[22:32:36] <fiasco> Cork, $.getScript won't work if the script is under a different domain no?
[22:32:46] <Cork> it does
[22:36:31] <raj> so Cork, I must ask, why in the world are you always awake so early?
[22:36:36] <raj> or perhaps late
[22:36:44] <Cork> heh
[22:36:47] <tw2113> Cork sleeps?
[22:37:07] <raj> he has the night shift :)
[22:37:16] <Cork> i'm at work at 06:00 go of at 15:00
[22:37:18] <tw2113> i think he just is
[22:37:31] <raj> wtf
[22:37:45] <raj> you work in the mines?
[22:37:45] <coldhead> its a big planet, raj
[22:37:59] <coldhead> off*
[22:38:10] <tw2113> my world is pretty small, but at least i'm king
[22:38:18] <raj> word
[22:38:18] <caniuse> raj: bond
[22:40:02] <coldhead> thansk caniuse
[22:40:11] <coldhead> caniuse: html5
[22:40:18] <coldhead> >: |
[22:41:09] <ihnru> what happens if i try to run 	$('iframe#cmtframe').iframeAutoHeight();	but there's no such element 'iframe#cmtframe' in the doc?
[22:41:21] <raj> caniuse: speak
[22:41:28] <coldhead> it does nothing silently, ihnru
[22:41:35] <raj> caniuse: go go gadget caniuse
[22:41:42] <coldhead> caniuse webgl
[22:41:49] <coldhead> word
[22:41:50] <caniuse> coldhead: bond
[22:41:52] <raj> haha
[22:41:59] <raj> word @coldhead
[22:41:59] <caniuse> coldhead: bond
[22:42:07] <coldhead> ohohohoho
[22:42:13] <raj> he's in here for 1 reason and 1 reason only
[22:42:24] <raj> to remind us that our word is our bond
[22:43:12] <Acrack> Cork it isn't working :(
[22:43:16] <raj> someone should write something on going from jquery to javascript
[22:43:24] <raj> i think jquery has completely spoiled me
[22:43:30] <Acrack> im not getting any alert with this :
[22:43:30] <Acrack> $(".good-answer").click(function(){
[22:43:31] <Acrack> 							alert($(this).data('answerId'));
[22:43:44] <tw2113> raj read books on javascript then
[22:44:04] <raj> right,there's that
[22:44:16] <coldhead> raj: unless you specifically need no-jquery why not just enjoy being spoiled?
[22:44:47] <raj> Acrack, put that in $(document).ready(function() { /*here*/ })
[22:45:19] <raj> coldhead, cuz I feel useless when someone asks a simple ass question in ##javascript and I can't answer it without jquery
[22:45:24] <raj> makes me feel dirty
[22:45:34] <coldhead> you should feel dirty for being in ##javascript
[22:45:39] <coldhead> those people are fascists
[22:45:54] <raj> i actually knew javascript like a couple months ago
[22:46:02] <tw2113> jquery is just javascript, javascript isn't just jquery
[22:46:04] <coldhead> sure you did
[22:46:09] <coldhead> we have all the logs, raj
[22:46:11] <raj> then I started using jquery, and I've forgotten how to do stuff
[22:46:16] <coldhead> we know exactly what you knew and when
[22:46:31] <raj> yes dad
[22:46:37] * tw2113 takes down a mental note...coldhead reads logs. Sound smarter
[22:46:42] <coldhead> there should be an inspirational movie about your jquery mastery
[22:46:54] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/29/ how i can get the var "20" please ?
[22:47:04] <raj> haha
[22:47:07] <raj> a training montage
[22:47:24] <coldhead> tw2113: i sound smarter because i use words like ebullient and woolfardisworthy; i don't actually know anything useful
[22:47:32] <coldhead> yes raj! like rocky!
[22:47:37] <raj> with Eviltwin and Cork, and you making wise-cracks in the background throughout
[22:47:38] <coldhead> oh sup rocky
[22:47:43] <tw2113> and my name is Mason Monkeymissile coldhead
[22:48:04] <coldhead> Mason Monkeymissile, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance
[22:48:16] <Cork> Acrack: if your not going to provide a link, don't use a tags
[22:48:45] <raj> woolfardisworthy is a place, not a word
[22:49:20] * tw2113 is starting to agree...anyone using alert to debug, needs their head checked
[22:49:30] <coldhead> it's in the book of lif, raj
[22:49:50] <Cork> Acrack: and attributes is case insensitive
[22:50:00] <Cork> Acrack: so data-asnwerid
[22:50:17] <Cork> and data('answerid')
[22:50:30] <Cork> *data-answerid
[22:51:32] <tw2113> i really really want to use data attributes, but for the life of me, i can't think up a good idea that'd need them
[22:51:40] <Acrack> ?
[22:51:52] <raj> you'll now when you do
[22:51:55] <raj> *know
[22:52:19] <tw2113> i'm hoping someday it'll smack me in the face
[22:52:35] <Cork> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/31/
[22:52:42] <raj> I really don't like that jquery uses some meta-data when setting the data attribute, instead of using the actual 'data' attribute
[22:53:23] <Cork> Acrack: or even better http://jsfiddle.net/LBUeK/32/
[22:53:23] <raj> Cork, but it's not in doc ready?
[22:53:37] <Cork> raj: its in onload
[22:53:58] <raj> so jsfiddle never needs document.ready?
[22:54:08] <Cork> only if you add it to head
[22:54:17] <Cork> (no wrap)
[22:54:28] <raj> ahh, i see
[22:54:35] <raj> i always lave it with the default (onLoad)
[22:54:39] <raj> *leave
[23:07:01] <Acrack> thanks Cork yea i figured it out
[23:07:08] <Acrack> that it was tolower thingy ^^
[23:14:09] <Double_Rainbow> hello world

[23:35:24] <c0defr3ak> demo is wrking on ie
[23:35:43] <c0defr3ak> ill see then wat i can do ..thx :)
[23:36:26] <coldhead> if you can link us to your broken version someone with IE can take a look
[23:36:36] <coldhead> it worked fine for me last time i used supersized
[23:36:44] <coldhead> might be a conflict with your existing CSS
[23:37:32] <c0defr3ak> yah thats wat i think
[23:37:49] <c0defr3ak> as i have made to many changes
[23:45:51] <Ar-ras> hi, how can i serialize all options of a multiselect field, selected nor unselected
[23:45:51] <Ar-ras> ?
[23:50:41] <Ar-ras> any ideas?
[23:50:59] <coldhead> unchecked elements don't have a value
[23:51:09] <coldhead> so serialize() doesn't bother with them
[23:51:45] <coldhead> i think you'd need to either write your own serialize OR insert hidden inputs with the values you want and let serialize() include them
[23:52:01] <Ar-ras> hidden input is not a real option
[23:54:33] <Ar-ras> i think i write my own serialize
[23:56:50] <coldhead> Ar-ras: if you can make a nice array of the inputs you can use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
