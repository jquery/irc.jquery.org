[01:21:02] <AlastairG> hi
[01:21:21] <AlastairG> quick request to help identify an array structure
[01:22:07] <AlastairG> http://paste2.org/p/1914433
[01:22:24] <AlastairG> i'm relatively new to JS and newer to jQ.
[01:23:05] <AlastairG> trying to parse that with PHP and presumed it to be a JS(JSON?) array but am having no luck using any of PHP's json functions to decipher it
[01:23:18] <AlastairG> just hoping someone can spot the structure before i write my own parser for it :/
[01:39:53] <mattyh88> hi, i have a rbt group with 2 options "yes - value = 1" and "no - value = 0". When I do an alert on the change event of the rbt group, i keep getting value = 0 whilst I'm actually choosing for the "1" option. What could this be?
[01:40:35] <mattyh88> this is my alert:  alert($("input[name='is_location_modified']").val());
[01:41:07] <skylamer`> On change?
[01:41:10] <mattyh88> yes
[01:41:33] <skylamer`> u sure?
[01:41:46] <mattyh88> yeh
[01:42:17] <mattyh88> well i call the 'enabledisablefields' function in my change event function, the enabledisable function has the alert in it
[01:42:23] <skylamer`> have a fiddle?
[01:44:08] <mattyh88> sure one moment
[01:44:11] <aqeel> u can use statemenet:yes:no;
[01:44:27] <mattyh88> http://jsfiddle.net/C9fmY/
[01:44:34] <aqeel> sorry statement?yes:no;
[01:44:37] <djQuery> grrr how to get the next sibling div?   $(this).next('div')?
[01:44:58] <josh___> hey guys, using jQuery how can I access one variable made in another function?
[01:45:01] <josh___> for example this: http://pastie.org/3443902
[01:45:12] <josh___> line 12 doesnt work cause its a seperate function
[01:45:28] <aqeel> pass it as parameter dj
[01:46:33] <djQuery> josh___, hmmmm postcode should be a global val at that point
[01:46:58] <josh___> djQuery:  well I thought that
[01:47:07] <josh___> but i keep getting told not to pollute the global namespace
[01:47:18] <djQuery> you want to do this on both keyup and blur?
[01:47:22] <mattyh88> skylamer`: got my link? :)
[01:47:30] <Cork> josh___: i gave you an example in javascript
[01:47:41] <josh___> aye
[01:47:57] <josh___> Cork:  I didnt fully understand that sorry, could you explain again?
[01:48:01] <josh___> I just saw you make 2 functions
[01:48:20] <Cork> josh___: (function() {})() creates a scope
[01:48:28] <josh___> right
[01:48:32] <Cork> everything you create in there will be clocal to its scope
[01:48:40] <josh___> Isee
[01:48:47] <Cork> so if you do var somthing; in there everything inside it will have access
[01:48:54] <Cork> but not outside it
[01:48:57] <josh___> Cork:  what if i make another function in there
[01:49:06] <josh___> and i var in there
[01:49:08] <Cork> it would be private
[01:49:11] <josh___> I see
[01:49:21] <josh___> thanks
[01:49:22] <djQuery> josh___, also if you want to do the same thing for both you know you can do .bind('keyup blur', function
[01:49:25] <Cork> unless you attach it to window.func_name = function() {}
[01:49:42] <josh___> djQuery: I didnt know that
[01:49:43] <josh___> thanks
[01:49:45] <djQuery> also to get the value its best to do this.value instead of $(this).val()
[01:50:01] <Cork> uh.. no
[01:50:12] <Cork> val adds some compatiblitity features you prob want
[01:50:34] <djQuery> Cork: what browser doesnt support .value?
[01:50:34] <Cork> josh___: anyway another option is to add the value to the element through .data
[01:51:01] <Cork> djQuery: its not that it doesn't support it, but some element behaves differently
[01:51:14] <Cork> inputs are normally safe, but not always
[01:51:47] <djQuery> cork: understood, I typicaly only suggest this for things like value id name
[01:51:47] <josh___> 'keyup blur', function.... has done the job just great thanks
[01:52:08] <josh___> djQuery:  when's your next gig?
[01:52:32] <Cork> josh___: for future notes see ?.data
[01:52:33] <bot-t> josh___, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:54:21] <djQuery>  josh___,  also if you dont want to polute the global namespace you could easily do  var josh__ = {}   then to set the value josh__.postcode = this.value;   retrieving it is just josh__.postcode
[01:55:12] <josh___> personally i don't care about the global namespace i just get told not to pollute it. A la douglas crawford lol
[01:55:34] <josh___> crockford*
[01:55:44] <Cork> adding functions to the global scope is normally fine
[01:55:44] <djQuery> well it is allways going to need to put something in global
[01:55:53] <Cork> adding varaibles there is less ok
[01:56:04] <josh___> closures still confuse me
[01:56:12] <josh___> read em yesterday got no idea
[01:56:46] <Cork> josh___: its basically a function thats run directly
[01:57:04] <Cork> creating a separate namespace
[01:57:33] <josh___> is that it?
[01:57:40] <Cork> ya
[01:58:06] <josh___> like what you did earlier? (function() {} ()
[01:58:07] <Cork> extending that is scope inheritance
[01:58:15] <josh___> how would you extend it?
[01:58:18] <Cork> (function() {})() yes
[01:58:29] <Cork> thats a closure
[01:58:39] <josh___> how would you inherit that Cork  ?
[01:59:04] <Cork> by creating every function you want to have access to that namespace inside it
[02:00:33] <josh___> IC
[02:00:51] <djQuery> (function(){   var postalcode = 90210;   $('$postalcode').bind('keyup', fucntion(){   postalcode = 10001;} }) console.log(postalcode); // undefined
[02:01:01] <Cork> ?eval (function() { var secret = true; window.access_secret() { return secret; } }); function public_secret() { return secret; }; access_secret()
[02:01:05] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[02:01:22] <Cork> ?eval (function() { var secret = true; window.access_secret = function() { return secret; } }); function public_secret() { return secret; }; access_secret()
[02:01:23] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: access_secret is not defined
[02:01:27] <Cork> -_-
[02:01:38] <Cork> oh right
[02:01:45] <djQuery> between our 2 examples he should get it
[02:01:46] <Cork> ?eval (function() { var secret = true; this.access_secret = function() { return secret; } }); function public_secret() { return secret; }; access_secret()
[02:01:47] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: access_secret is not defined
[02:01:52] * Cork hits bot-t
[02:02:23] <Cork> i always forget that window doesn't exists in the bots >_>
[02:06:33] <djQuery> dang it what even is triggered when an item is added to the dom?
[02:06:57] <Cork> cross browsers; none
[02:07:09] <djQuery> dont care cross browser
[02:10:56] <Cork> djQuery: DOMSubtreeModified, DOMNodeInserted
[02:11:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM_Client_Object_Cross-Reference/DOM_Events#Events
[02:11:51] <djQuery> gnarf had a good plugin that did this but I cant find it now
[02:16:49] <djQuery> Cork: here it is https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:18:37] <djQuery> ?newcontent
[02:18:38] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:18:46] <Adamantus> Hi, toal noob here. How do I iterate through an object (not array). Like: var data = {a:"My value",b:"another value",thing:"x"};  those keys are all different.
[02:18:50] <Adamantus> total*
[02:18:50] <makinen> how can I add a new td to a certain column on a row?
[02:19:00] <Cork> djQuery: it doesn't really monitor the dom though :)
[02:19:11] <Cork> djQuery: its just a callback broker
[02:20:11] <Cork> djQuery: but ya, its a nice implementation on wrapping all calls so you can catch updates
[02:20:31] <makinen> I tried this but it adds the td into an existing td and not next to it: $('td:eq('+col_eq+')').after().append(td_new);
[02:20:36] <Cork> (things like .load or pure javascript would fail though)
[02:21:07] <djQuery> Cork: gonna have to test it out with knockout.js
[02:21:22] <Cork> ?insertAfter @ makinen
[02:21:23] <bot-t> makinen, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[02:21:28] <djQuery> dont quite know how it appendsd elements to the dom
[02:21:28] <Adamantus> I got it
[02:22:03] <Cork> makinen: when your appending, your appending :)
[02:22:39] <Cork> makinen: ug sorry, was offtrack a bit there
[02:22:49] <Cork> makinen: you need to pass new_td to after
[02:22:52] <Cork> not chain it
[02:26:04] <djQuery> cork: using newConent you could trigger the newcontent manualy in the success callback of your .load
[02:26:16] <Cork> sure
[02:26:27] <Cork> i meant more like $(elm).load('url')
[02:26:52] <Cork> or rather $(elm).newContent.load('url')
[02:27:01] <Cork> uh *newContent()
[02:27:49] <djQuery> $(elm).load('url' function(){$(this).newContent(); });
[02:28:33] <djQuery> might have to throw a .children in there
[02:29:14] <Cork> djQuery: my point wasn't that it isn't doable, but that you have to be carefull so you don't make asumptions
[02:30:04] <sasori_> hi, any suggestions or tips how to overwrite this thing ? http://i.imgur.com/p12sv.jpg  :( , it's a jcarousel lite
[02:31:48] <Trisox> what is the right systax for doing something like this  setInterval( ajaxInt(priorityCheckId, jsonUrl,name), 10000 );
[02:31:49] <djQuery> $('.viewed-content').css('width', '100%');
[02:31:59] <djQuery> sasori_, ^^
[02:32:12] <Cork> setInterval(function() { ajaxInt(priorityCheckId, jsonUrl,name); }, 10000 );
[02:32:36] <Trisox> thnx cork
[02:32:37] <sasori_> djQuery: hmmn..lemme try, not sure if that's gonna work though
[02:33:04] <Cork> Trisox: though most of the time you want to use setTimeout instead of setInterval
[02:34:45] <djQuery> ?setinterval
[02:34:46] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[02:34:51] <sasori_> djQuery: lol, that's awesome..thanks man..it worked :D
[02:35:32] <djQuery> Trisox, read the 1 and 2 there
[02:36:16] <djQuery> Trisox, especialy 2 since you seem to be doing some ajax call there
[02:37:40] <Trisox> ajax call indeed djQuery
[02:38:15] <Trisox> nice one djQuery :)
[02:38:35] <djQuery> i didnt write it :)
[02:39:09] <Trisox> thnx for the link ;)
[02:39:17] <Trisox> interval is on 1 min or so
[02:39:33] <Trisox> i dont think ill be needing that advanced stuff
[02:39:45] <djQuery> ?dotimeout
[02:39:46] <Trisox> just some small json
[02:39:46] <bot-t> doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, it’s fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[02:39:58] <Trisox> nah ;)
[02:40:13] <Trisox> ill show you what i do
[02:40:55] <djQuery> Trisox, I remember you from when I used to be on here all the time and think you can handle it
[02:41:05] <Trisox> jdparker: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/V3MaG/
[02:41:11] <Trisox> i can ;) haha
[02:41:15] <Trisox> djQuery
[02:45:27] <djQuery> Trisox, my I suggest http://jsfiddle.net/V3MaG/2/
[02:45:39] <djQuery> I dont know how many items you are appending but ....
[02:52:43] <Trisox> djQuery: not much
[02:53:14] <wojtek> hi
[02:53:43] <Trisox> djQuery: whats diverent?
[02:54:02] <djQuery> the 2 lines are commented that I changed.
[02:54:07] <wojtek> can I add a DOM structure to an empty jQuery container, e.g $()? I'd like to treat it as a temporary container
[02:54:24] <djQuery> basicaly declared the var before the loop and appended the var after the loo[
[02:54:24] <Trisox> ah the each nice catch thats faster indeed
[02:54:24] <Cork> wojtek: $([])
[02:54:25] <Trisox> :)
[02:54:26] <djQuery> loop
[02:54:35] <wojtek> Cork: let me see :)
[02:54:37] <Trisox> list is like 50 items or so
[02:55:07] <Cork> wojtek: that would create an empty selector, and i guess thats what you eant
[02:55:10] <Cork> *meant
[02:55:44] <djQuery> ?.add
[02:55:45] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[02:56:32] <djQuery> var empty  = $([]);     empty = empty.add('someselector');
[02:56:51] <Cork> and don't forget the empyt =  :)
[02:57:10] <Cork> add doesn't modify the original selector
[02:57:13] <makinen> Cork: thanks that did the trick
[02:59:53] <wojtek> Cork, djQuery but the structure I want to add to the empty container is not inserted into dom; I get an empty object
[03:00:10] <wojtek> I tried with .add and .append
[03:00:28] <wojtek> for example adding just loaded image
[03:00:36] <Cork> wojtek: you mean something like $('<div/>') ?
[03:00:52] <MrMadcap> Any idea why $(this).find('#div_ID').length would return 1 in $('document').ready(function(){}), but 0 everywhere else, regardless of if it's called prior to or after?
[03:00:53] <Cork> that would create a div you can add your elements to
[03:01:56] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/GvGbe/         <<< this works, but not on my page ( http://popnetgen.netgendns.co.za ) ... It should work when you click on the Richmark/BluChipMedia logos
[03:01:58] <MrMadcap> Alternatively, $(this).find('#div_ID') returns [object Object] at all times, and $(this).find('#div_ID').outerWidth() returns 500 in $('document').ready(function(){}) (which is correct) and NULL elsewhere
[03:02:09] <Ortund> actually... it should hide the bottom-right text on load
[03:02:35] <wojtek> Cork: for example I'm loading an image and would like to add it (it refers to ‘this’) to the empty container to insert it later when deferred is resolved
[03:02:38] <phil-adept> can anyone recomend any good jquery plugins to work with tables?
[03:02:59] <phil-adept> ideally drag sortable rows
[03:03:03] <Cork> wojtek: that would be .add then
[03:03:17] <wojtek> Cork: $structure = $([]); [...]; $structure.add(this) → this refers to the image
[03:03:33] <Cork> exactly
[03:03:35] <wojtek> and then I get an empty object
[03:03:57] <Cork> you missed "<Cork> and don't forget the empyt =  :)"
[03:04:13] <Cork> $structure = $structure.add(this)
[03:04:26] <Cork> add return the new array
[03:04:29] <wojtek> ah, I see :)
[03:04:32] <Cork> it doesn't modify the original
[03:04:52] <Cork> its more like .push
[03:05:02] <Cork> uh...
[03:05:06] <Cork> scratch that XD
[03:05:12] <Cork> its NOT like push XD
[03:05:15] <wojtek> Cork: it works! :)
[03:05:48] <wojtek> Cork: but can I keep the chain?
[03:05:58] <Cork> sure
[03:06:15] <Cork> $structure = $structure.add().add().add()
[03:06:17] <Cork> should work fine
[03:06:38] <wojtek> what about $structure.add(this).hide()?
[03:07:33] <Cork> sure
[03:08:35] <Cork> wojtek: just remeber that every time you do .add you have to resave the output
[03:09:01] <Cork> so if you want the added element to be in the selection $structure = $structure.add(this).hide() is needed
[03:09:02] <wojtek> Cork: but why can't I manipulate an empty object with .append/other manipulation methods?
[03:09:16] <Cork> cause its not an element
[03:09:32] <Cork> its just an empty array
[03:10:18] <djQuery> anyone here anyting about ui 1.9 beta release date?
[03:10:30] <djQuery> seems its stuckin alpha
[03:10:39] <wojtek> Cork: but when the image is added it is more than just an empty array? :)
[03:11:14] <wojtek> Cork: I mean, when you make the first step
[03:11:52] <Cork> wojtek: sure and then append should work; on the first element
[03:11:55] <Cork> ?.append
[03:11:55] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:12:15] <Cork> wojtek: opps its every eleent
[03:12:19] <Cork> *element
[03:12:41] <Cork> wojtek: append adds element as children to the elements in the selection array
[03:12:48] <Cork> add adds element to the array
[03:13:29] <wojtek> Cork: that’s what I’m looking for (children) :D
[03:13:55] <Cork> so you want to create an element, and then append children to it?
[03:14:38] <Cork> var $structure = $('<div/>'); $structure.append('<span>new</span>')
[03:22:58] <wojtek> Cork: I meant sth like this: $structure = $structure.add(  flashStructure).children().wrap( $wrapper); but it doesn't seem to work
[03:23:15] <wojtek> that I can't access children in the chain
[03:23:34] <GoSox> wojtek: wow what a first msg to see upon joining a channel
[03:23:47] <GoSox> welcome to #pedo_irc
[03:24:00] <wojtek> GoSox xD
[03:24:36] <Cork> wojtek: why not just do $(this) then?
[03:25:14] <wojtek> Cork: that example works, now I have a more complicated :D
[03:25:18] <Cork> or $(flashStructure)
[03:26:25] <wojtek> Cork: hm, that's may work
[03:26:33] <wojtek> that
[03:26:40] <MrMadcap> This is as simple an example as I could make:
[03:26:41] <johnthejohn> What's wrong with this code? https://gist.github.com/1900309 It just crashes my browser.
[03:26:41] <MrMadcap> https://madcapstudios.com/temp/analyticsdebug.php
[03:26:47] <MrMadcap> Check out the console / source
[03:27:28] <Cork> johnthejohn: did you really mean crash?
[03:27:37] <Cork> or just that the page stopped running?
[03:27:57] <johnthejohn> Cork: the page stopped running and after a while, Chrome asks me if I want to kill the tab
[03:28:23] <Cork> well while(data[0]) sounds like a bad idea
[03:28:28] <GoSox> sounds like an endless loop
[03:29:01] <Cork> and if you loop a really big array in while or for the browser will normally try to kill you
[03:29:27] <Cork> btw $().ready isn't valid
[03:29:54] <johnthejohn> What should it be? $(document).ready?
[03:30:00] <mattfieldy> johnthejohn: yep
[03:30:05] <Cork> or simply $(function() {
[03:30:14] <Cork> both work
[03:30:18] <Cork> and does the same thing
[03:31:24] <johnthejohn> Thanks
[03:32:30] <MrMadcap> https://madcapstudios.com/temp/analyticsdebug.php  <-  Any idea why the same value is returning 2 different results?  :\
[03:33:20] <Cork> MrMadcap: your using this in a ready event, and that doesn't make sence
[03:33:39] <MrMadcap> Can you explain that?
[03:33:43] <Cork> MrMadcap: and secondly accessing the dom before its done loading will result in unknown effects
[03:34:07] <Cork> MrMadcap: this is a variable returned in callbacks
[03:34:20] <MrMadcap> Cork:  I removed the pre-ready log.  Same behavior.
[03:35:08] <Cork> well postReadyLog won't use the this from ready
[03:35:20] <Cork> you need to set its this variable if you want it there
[03:35:33] <MrMadcap> Cork:  Oh, 'this' changes?  Perhaps that's my misunderstanding.
[03:35:34] <Cork> postReadyLog.call(this);
[03:35:51] <Cork> MrMadcap: yes this is a local variable
[03:36:24] <MrMadcap> I'm going to be including this document more than once in a parent document, so I need to target classes within this document only.  What would be the best way to go about that?
[03:36:41] <Cork> MrMadcap: each function that isn't part of a constructor prototype or get passed an object for this (.call or .apply) will have window as this
[03:36:46] <MrMadcap> $('document').find() ?
[03:37:07] <Cork> $('selector')
[03:37:18] <Cork> selectors never reach cross documents
[03:37:28] <MrMadcap> Sure they do
[03:37:30] <MrMadcap> I do it all the time
[03:37:52] <Cork> only if you give them the other document as the document to work on
[03:38:16] <MrMadcap> I'll mess around with it a little bit more, but thanks for clearing up the 'this' issue
[03:44:12] <MrMadcap> Yeah, I loaded the same document twice into two differently sized divs with width:100% on the class in question.  When referencing via $('selector'), it always selects the first element on the page, regardless of which document it's called from.
[03:44:17] <MrMadcap> So that's not going to work for me.
[03:44:35] <Cork> uh..
[03:44:38] <MrMadcap> I need something along the lines of $('document').find('.class'), but that doesn't seem to be working.
[03:44:45] <Cork> if you load something into a div, its not different documents
[03:44:57] <MrMadcap> It's being loaded FROM different documents
[03:45:11] <MrMadcap> A single .php, loaded multiple times
[03:45:15] <Cork> different document is something you haven't attached (append, html, prepend or similar) or iframe or frame
[03:45:27] <Cork> thats just html appended to the same document
[03:45:48] <Cork> you can't differenciate something you append from whats already in the document
[03:46:10] <Cork> except through a class or id
[03:46:44] <MrMadcap> So if you have a hierarchy of MainDocument -> include( childDocument.php ) twice, is there a suggestion for how to handle objects within those child documents independently?
[03:47:07] <Cork> is childdocument a full html file?
[03:47:07] <Hooloovoo> MrMadcap: learn to separate frontend code from backend
[03:47:11] <wojtek> does an element has to be inserted into DOM to wrap it with another element?
[03:47:13] <Cork> as it <html> and everything?
[03:47:27] <MrMadcap> Cork:  No.  Should it?  :P
[03:47:30] <Cork> wojtek: not really
[03:47:35] <Cork> MrMadcap: defenitly not
[03:47:37] <MrMadcap> k
[03:47:51] <Cork> that generates horribly broken html
[03:47:58] <MrMadcap> That's what I always assumed.
[03:48:24] <wojtek> Cork: hm, I can't wrap Object (the snippet used to insert flash videos)
[03:48:44] <Cork> wojtek: i would revert the flow
[03:49:04] <Cork> $structure = $('<wrapper>').append($structure)
[03:49:18] <Cork> or create the wrapper first
[03:49:22] <Cork> and append everything to it
[03:50:07] <talin> hello. i'm not sure if this is possible (or easy) with jquery, but i want to display a <tr> that is hidden when a particular text is chosen in a <select> box
[03:50:07] <LordThumper> The server sends back a full .html file
[03:50:11] <talin> can this be done with jquery?
[03:50:31] <LordThumper> You are probably using a wrong selector
[03:51:18] <xarxer> Does anyone know of a good downloadable/tutorial for a good multi level vertical menu using jQuery?
[03:51:50] <xarxer> Found nice ones using Accordion from jQuery UI, but they're just one level deep..
[03:52:24] <LordThumper> talin: $('#selectbox").on('change', function () { $("tr>td:first-child").text($(this).val()).show() });
[03:52:45] <LordThumper> Replace selectors as required
[03:52:58] <talin> LordThumper: uhm wow. let me try that
[03:54:49] <LordThumper> Try to create a jsfiddle with you markup talin
[03:55:02] <LordThumper> If you have any problems with the selectors
[03:55:21] <MrMadcap> Well damn.  This leads me to believe the whole implementation cannot work.  :|
[03:55:57] <Cork> MrMadcap: what you can do though
[03:56:40] <Cork> is something like $.get(..., function(data) { var $data = $(data); $data.modify_it; $container.append($data); });
[04:01:54] <LordThumper> talin

[04:17:13] <poppiez> with ajax you do .setRequestHeader('whatever', 1000); can you do that with regular forms too?
[04:17:34] <poppiez> (beforeSend)
[04:26:40] <talin> LordThumper: hmm, in order to see if it works at all, i tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/ps3zr/1/
[04:26:46] <talin> LordThumper: but nothing happened
[04:28:34] <GoSox> You've got an Apple! You eat it, but nothing happens.
[04:31:42] <xec> talin: your code is very confusing, are you copypasting?
[04:32:22] <xec> talin: and.. you have html in the javascript field??
[04:32:42] <fof> talin i want to help but your markup is crazy
[04:32:53] <Hooloovoo> i have to see this
[04:33:51] <Hooloovoo> it's not THAT bad. remove a few lines in the js area and it's good to  go
[04:34:03] <xec> Hooloovoo: di you try that?
[04:34:27] <xec> talin: what on earth is the backslash doing, what are you closing with the last }); and there is nothing with id "id_product"
[04:34:54] <xec> "#toggle_felt tr" will NOT match <tr id="toggle_felt">
[04:35:00] <fof> talin: this is LordThumper's example adapted to sort of match yours http://jsfiddle.net/tX7zu/
[04:35:20] <henrico> guys when writing a plugin in jquery shall we write that in jquery framework file or create a new one?
[04:35:30] <GoSox> fof: what does your nick mean?
[04:35:43] <fof> nothing
[04:35:52] <xec> literally?
[04:36:06] <xec> like, "fof" actually means "nothing"? :D
[04:36:22] <GoSox> there is an anti-mountain biking group that calls themselves the "friends of the fells" and goes by "fof" for short
[04:36:29] <fof> lol
[04:36:42] <talin> fof: hmm, thanks
[04:36:50] <fof> i love mountain biking though
[04:37:16] <henrico> guys when writing a plugin in jquery shall we write that in jquery framework file or create a new one?
[04:37:32] <Hooloovoo> talin: this will get you on track http://jsfiddle.net/ps3zr/5/
[04:37:41] <GoSox> fof: as do i
[04:37:45] <Hooloovoo> it  works a lot better now, but i didn't fix it all
[04:38:25] <jlebrech> does anyone know of a tag completion plugin which can also set the tag color?
[04:43:43] <talin> Hooloovoo: it works on jsfiddle, but not on my page. i will post exactly what i have... maybe i overlooked something silly?
[04:44:33] <henrico> what to do to get some help here i thought i just needed to ask for it
[04:44:53] <Hooloovoo> henrico: new file
[04:45:14] <Hooloovoo> henrico: unless you're crazy. crazy people are  free to put it in the jquery file.
[04:46:03] <xec> how about crazy scientists?
[04:46:05] <henrico> hooloovoo, so everytime we are using it we must include that in in html file right?
[04:47:43] <xec> henrico: if the question is "must i include a script i want to use" then the answer is yes
[04:48:40] <xec> henrico: also, make sure to include dependencies first, i.e. jquery lib before scripts that depend on it (like plugins do)
[04:50:27] <henrico> xec you mean include jquery framewotk fisrt?
[04:50:53] <xec> in essence, yes
[04:51:59] <henrico> xec why they do write plugin code wrapped in brackts like that jsfiddle.net/QzYc5/
[04:53:09] <fof> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[04:53:12] <xec> henrico: in case of conflict, mainly - $ isn't always jQuery, this makes sure it is

[04:54:38] <xec> henrico: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[04:55:28] <xec> assuming you mean the first and last lines of that fiddle of yours
[04:59:30] <Ortund> Here's what I have --> http://pastebin.com/cXNpBR4t ... Here's the effect I want --> http://jsfiddle.net/GvGbe/  ... if anyone can guess why that jquery doesn't work in wordpress, that'll help too
[05:00:46] <_shell0x> hi
[05:03:12] <talin> okay, now i have a better example, that i thought would work
[05:03:14] <talin> http://jsfiddle.net/8MAHD/5/
[05:03:38] <talin> when i select a product now, i thought the second <tr> would appear...
[05:05:22] <mspalmer1> Hey, I have a menu pane where I want to give the illusion everything is sliding. I'm very new to jQuery and got the hang of the animate function a bit but when I move an element up and it hits other pictures it simply starts moving down. Is there an easier way to do this than shrinking all the pictures above it?
[05:05:48] <_shell0x> is anyone familar with the jquery validation plugin?
[05:06:07] <xec> ?demo @ mspalmer1
[05:06:07] <bot-t> mspalmer1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:06:13] <xec> ?anyone @ _shell0x
[05:06:13] <bot-t> _shell0x, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[05:06:37] <_shell0x> https://gist.github.com/2ddc95a99ae33ee9ff49
[05:07:08] <mspalmer1> http://decorgroupinc.com/test/archmouldings-builder/   You need to click "Next" to have it execute. Also I'm working on cleaning up the disaster that is getting classes mixed up with id's (I'm really new to this)
[05:07:44] <xec> talin: what is toggle_felt an ID of? does it have any descendant tr's ?
[05:08:04] <talin> xec: the second <tr>
[05:08:12] <_shell0x> it always returns the same error and i have no idea why. I had a look in the error log in the firefox console and there wasn't an error in it
[05:08:36] <xec> talin: exactly. "#toggle_felt tr" will NOT match <tr id="toggle_felt">
[05:08:36] <_shell0x> you have an idea whats wrong with this little piece of code?
[05:09:06] <xec> talin: "#toggle_felt" will
[05:09:10] <talin> xec: hmm
[05:09:23] <xec> talin: and "tr#toggle_felt" will
[05:09:55] <talin> xec: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/8MAHD/8/
[05:10:20] <talin> xec: i only changed line 3 in the javascript window
[05:10:28] <mindis|wurk> hmm, i wonder where my text disappears when i use percentages for my font size
[05:10:43] <fof> choose jquery from framework tools btw
[05:11:04] <talin> fof: oh, good idea
[05:11:12] <xec> talin: yes, closer. now - the #toggle_felt is hidden, and you're not doing anything to show it
[05:11:59] <talin> xec: hmm, i made the same change on the actual website, and the alert() still doesn't trigger
[05:12:35] <xec> talin: you need to attach the change event handler to the select
[05:13:10] <talin> xec: how come jsfiddle doesn't need that?
[05:13:18] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/8MAHD/9/
[05:14:10] <fof> your previous .show() was only operating on the label (which was within a hidden tr)
[05:14:10] <xrfang_> hi, I have a question about rendering the <select> element, it seems that jquery mobile does not respect style settings in <option> tag, is that a known problem?
[05:14:34] <xrfang_> e.g. <option value="test" style="display:none">test</option>
[05:14:43] <xrfang_> I expect this item to NOT display
[05:15:12] <xec> talin: sorry you already had it attached to the select, i misread the html (saw for="" instead)
[05:15:23] <talin> xec: ah, okay. hmm
[05:15:36] <talin> fof: so i don't need teh second line? i can replace it with your much simpler one?
[05:16:26] <fof> i think you should follow some introductory tutorials before you continue
[05:16:39] <fof> because i dont think you can achieve what you want to with what you know
[05:17:34] <talin> fof: you are probably right. i just wish it would work for me outside of jsfiddle, because i don't know if it's a javascript problem or html or css or something else
[05:17:49] <fof> yeah sorry no idea about that
[05:18:16] <talin> i think i should focus on making the alert() work on my webpage before anything else
[05:18:32] <fof> maybe have a look at http://jqfundamentals.com/ later
[05:18:45] <talin> but i have saved all your tips and code
[05:21:18] <s1n4> hello, why does not work the following code ?
[05:21:19] <s1n4>       $(".nav li").each(
[05:21:19] <s1n4>           function() {
[05:21:19] <s1n4>               if ($("a").attr("href") == window.location.pathname) {
[05:21:20] <s1n4> 	          this.addClass("active")}
[05:21:20] <s1n4>       });
[05:22:51] <xec> s1n4: don't paste code in the channel. create a demo at jsfiddle.net. "not work" is not meaninful
[05:23:13] <s1n4> xec, sorry
[05:23:15] <fof> you're missing a semi-colon in your anonymous function
[05:23:19] <fof> may not be why it's broken
[05:24:03] <xec> s1n4: explain what happens, and what you expect to happen instead
[05:25:33] <s1n4> xec, I wanna add "active" to class of a tag by the url
[05:26:04] <s1n4> xec, and nothing happens with the above code
[05:26:08] <xrfang_> could anyone explain how jquery mobile render its select element?
[05:26:19] <xec> s1n4: create a demo, with markup
[05:29:21] <s1n4> xec, I dunno what happens, whats the problem in that code ?
[05:29:35] <xec> s1n4: noone knows
[05:30:23] <xec> s1n4: i still don't know what you're trying to do, and you haven't even tried to create a fiddle
[05:32:04] <s1n4> xec, I told you I wanna add "active" to class of a tag by the url
[05:32:08] <xec> s1n4: you seem to bee looping through a list and then checking the attribute of the first <a> in the document
[05:32:16] <s1n4> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/3Xxyv/
[05:35:34] <xec> s1n4: loop through the anchors instead, and use $(this).addClass(...) not this.addClass(...)
[05:35:40] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/3Xxyv/1/
[05:36:10] <talin> when i run this jquery in chrome with the javascript console, i see "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on'". it refers to the line: $("#id_produkt").on("change", function() {
[05:37:12] <xec> s1n4: or even better, only select the one you want http://jsfiddle.net/3Xxyv/2/
[05:37:57] <antdillon> xec, nice improvement, wondered if you would use selectors
[05:38:24] <s1n4> xec, thanks for the help, how can I set "active" for that <li> tag instead of <a>
[05:38:35] <xec> s1n4: .parent()
[05:38:38] <xrfang_> hi, http://pastebin.com/9MUmzE2t
[05:38:47] <xrfang_> could anyone help with this code
[05:39:04] <xrfang_> what I want is that JQM can respect the "display:none" setting on line #13
[05:41:00] <s1n4> xec, how ?
[05:41:12] <xec> s1n4: http://jsfiddle.net/3Xxyv/3/
[05:41:33] <talin> xec, fof: i think i know why it doesn't work on my website. when i follow the link to "jquery-latest.js" that is referenced from my code, it is jquery 1.4.2, and when i choose that on jsfiddle, it doesn't work there either. in fact, on jsfiddle it only works with 1.7.x
[05:41:59] <xec> talin: yes, .on() is new
[05:42:37] <talin> xec: i will try to link to: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[05:42:43] <xec> talin: i recommend you update to 1.7.1 - looks like someone copied the "latest" long time ago
[05:44:27] <talin> xec: heh, now everything works
[05:44:31] * talin bangs his head against the wall
[05:44:34] <sasori_> hi, can you guys recommend the most jcarousel stuff that has less configurations ?
[05:45:36] <xec> sasori_: surely options are a good thing? i mean, they are optional...
[05:46:11] <sasori_> have you used one? what's the name..i'll google it
[05:47:50] <xec> sasori_: actually haven't found one i like - probably mostly because i'm not a fan of the carousel concept ;)
[05:48:52] <sasori_> neither do i, i just need it in a project lol
[05:49:34] <s1n4> xec, thanks
[05:53:01] <AdvoWork> How can I do:  var single_elements = { product_types: product_types, product_types2: product_types2 ....  but account for those being undefined/blank?
[06:00:11] <exoit> Is there any easy way to make $.ajax/load ignore inline scripts if they are already present ?
[06:04:24] <iLogic> exoit: if that's a click triggered thing, you could remove them from html with removeAttr();
[06:04:59] <iLogic> with something like $('a').removeAttr('on click');
[06:05:07] <iLogic> ops, onclick, no space
[06:07:39] <exoit> iLogic, The problem i have is that i load and reload pages with the $.ajax call and when these pages have inline javascript or loads a .js file, i end up mutliple instance of the scripts in the browser so a trigger fires mutiple times t.ex. .live('change' for a combobox
[06:08:28] <Adamantus> How would you achive check if an array key exists in jquery?
[06:08:35] <Adamantus> *achieve
[06:09:12] <simon> same as in JS.
[06:09:24] <Adamantus> how?
[06:09:40] <simon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1098040/checking-if-an-associative-array-key-exists-in-javascript
[06:10:03] <simon> there are several ways with slightly different meanings.
[06:10:45] <xec> Adamantus: do you mean an object key? or array value perhaps?
[06:11:19] <Adamantus> xec: An object like: var a={thing:"value"};
[06:11:33] <Adamantus> So I'm checking if thing exists
[06:11:52] <Adamantus> simon: I've already got that article open but I'm not sure about "key in myarray" where can I use that?
[06:12:24] <Adamantus> I have this but probably wrong: $.each( required, function(key,value) )    {   if(! key in data) return false;    });
[06:13:24] <xec> can't you just do if(a.thing) ?
[06:14:18] <Adamantus> xec: I don't know, I'm new to jquery
[06:14:25] <xec> it's not jquery
[06:14:41] <xec> of course, that test will fail if thing is 0 or an empty string
[06:16:02] <Adamantus> Why be like that? I think you know what I'm saying.
[06:16:15] <xec> what?
[06:16:29] <Adamantus> it't not jquery
[06:16:35] <Adamantus> it's
[06:16:42] <xec> Adamantus: it's not - it's plain old javascript
[06:17:10] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "value" }; if(a.thing) { print("truuuue") };
[06:17:14] <bot-t> xec: "truuuue"
[06:17:24] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "value" }; if(a.thingymabob) { print("truuuue") };
[06:17:25] <bot-t> xec: undefined
[06:18:19] <iLogic> exoit: sounds odd.. I thought an ajax load would strip the scripts so I had to load them via getScript()
[06:18:58] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "value" }; if ("thing" in a) { print("truuuue") };
[06:18:59] <bot-t> xec: "truuuue"
[06:19:06] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "" }; if ("thing" in a) { print("truuuue") };
[06:19:07] <bot-t> xec: "truuuue"
[06:19:17] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "" }; if (a.thing) { print("truuuue") };
[06:19:17] <bot-t> xec: undefined
[06:19:38] <xec> ?eval var a = { thing: "" }; if ("thingymajig" in a) { print("truuuue") };
[06:19:39] <bot-t> xec: undefined
[06:19:49] <exoit> iLogic, doesn't do it for me, however there was only a problem when i used the .live('change' tigger apperently so changed those to .bind instead
[06:19:53] <xec> sorry for spamming :P
[06:20:06] <xec> Adamantus: did that make sense to you?
[06:20:38] <Adamantus> xec: Yes, thank you
[06:21:08] <iLogic> exoit: how about migrating those inlines, too much hassle?
[06:21:53] <exoit> iLogic, have the same problem with loading the javascript from files
[06:22:27] <iLogic> sounds like a code mess
[06:23:44] <xec> mmmm spaghetti
[06:24:32] <exoit> iLogic, or i haven't tried to just use the normal javascript tag to load the files, as im using the PHP Zend Framework guess i can try that and see if it makes any difference, however i would think the zend framework would just generate those tags
[06:25:17] <m4co> can I make an "or" selector in jQuery?
[06:25:21] <m4co> something like $() || $()
[06:25:26] <pootietang> I'm having a problem displaying data within a certain area
[06:25:34] <m4co> var foo =  $() || $()
[06:25:59] <pootietang> I have an example on the following page: http://goo.gl/qwVc4
[06:26:12] <pootietang> the tab Notes
[06:26:33] <pootietang> I need the notes to be displayed within the white area
[06:26:41] <pootietang> wiath a scroll bar
[06:40:00] <iLogic> exoit: again, I believe you could strip the scripts before loading, say with php's strip_tags function?
[06:48:41] <Jeroenem> Hi could someone help me with a tiny question? See an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/jqmjN/12/ - I need to change the image, <h2> and <p> on click of one of the list-items and so forth
[06:49:01] <Jeroenem> but i just cant get into the right direction... anyone who can point me in the right one?
[06:51:58] <kurol> well what I would do is have the whole chunk prerendered somewhere hidden on the page
[06:52:06] <kurol> then when you click you swap out the content
[06:52:24] <Jeroenem> yeah, thats what i've thought of in the first place
[06:52:55] <kurol> the alternative is to change each directly
[06:52:56] <Jeroenem> but not sure how to "link" them up as you know what i mean
[06:53:01] <iLogic> also.. it's safer to wrap each of those items inside a <a> tag, and get the $('#preview .more li a').attr('href') instead
[06:53:24] <Whirl3d> jeroenem, you could also use an .on handler for your ul element like: $(".more").on("click","li",function (e) {var lnk=$(e.target);....});
[06:53:31] <kurol> it depends on how many items... data source...
[06:54:45] <Jeroenem> Well maybe prerendering is the best option here, the list will contain a maximum of 20 items with 20 little pictures
[06:55:41] <kurol> well i guess prerendering is a bad term. since they're hidden the browser won't technically bother to render them
[06:57:40] <Jeroenem> the only thing i dont get, is how to 'link' them up. How do i know which image to display while clicking on the LI - same goes for the H2 heading and paragraph
[06:57:55] <kurol> i would follow the way jqueryui does it for tabs
[06:58:07] <KarateKip3> I have a peculiar problem. Why can't I use a .hide() inside a .ready() function? When I do $(".phone").hide(); within a document ready function, it just doesn't work. However, when I put that same code within a click event it works fine. And there's nothing wrong with the ready function itself, because when I do alert('test'); then the popup appears after the webpage has loaded.
[06:59:13] <kurol> in fact, I would structure your document as if you were using jqueryui tabs first, then write your own custom javascript to display as you want instead of tabbed behavior
[07:00:37] <fof> you should be able to KarateKip3
[07:01:16] <KarateKip3> fof: hmm... then this is gonna be a long long night... :(
[07:01:42] <kurol> make sure $('.phone') does something
[07:01:59] <kurol> or for a cheap delay, use $(window).load instead of .ready
[07:02:13] <KarateKip3> kurol: it does something only when i put it outside .ready()
[07:02:24] <hurry> can i use beforeSend and complete if i use $.post?
[07:02:37] <KarateKip3> kurol: ok, will try $(window).load
[07:03:53] <fof> are you applying a style or adding the content after you call hide()?
[07:04:51] <KarateKip3> fof: yes, there is CSS which was done by the graphic designer... I will rename the DIVs and see what happens
[07:06:38] <KarateKip3> fof: nothing happened after renaming the DIVs. Now i'm using DIVs which have no style
[07:08:33] <fof> style-wise i meant anything that might show the element after you hide it
[07:08:54] <fof> and you're certain it's in the DOM?
[07:10:26] <KarateKip3> after using window.load it DOES hide now. But I'm fixing other issues now, of which I don't yet if they are related.
[07:20:22] <KarateKip3> i think the window.load doesn't work correctly because when i press RELOAD a few times, then it seems to work randomly.
[07:21:17] <KarateKip3> perhaps document.ready is better to use, but that won't work with my .hide() functions. So weird.
[07:26:41] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jqueryui: jQuery UI 1.8.18 is out: http://t.co/uDw4ZT4W Scott doing all magic! Tons of bugfixes! ★ http://bit.ly/zvmda2
[07:34:00] <Gergov> guys i try to change my active state on my menu and i have http://pastebin.com/jXsK1sWZ this code but as soon i release the mouse when i click, its going back to like it was before i click.
[07:36:10] <z0ned> Gergov, you removeClass, and then addClass right after
[07:36:27] <z0ned> ?
[07:36:46] <Gergov> z0ned, i remove it from the previous a that have .active and add it to (this) which was clicked
[07:37:36] <Gergov> or at least thats what i think its doing
[07:37:52] <z0ned> Gergov, console.log(this); and see what it is
[07:38:20] <z0ned> (pretty sure it's all a's in the menu)
[07:40:37] <Gergov> z0ned, well (this) returns every button i click
[07:41:58] <Gergov> if i click "home" i get <a href="home" class="active"></a>.. if i click "somethingelse" its the same just the href is "jsomethingelse"
[07:42:29] <johanhar_> Ive got a <input> and want to bind some event whenever the value change, is that possible, will <input> trigger any event on a "value change"?
[07:43:29] <fof> something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/AMAyA/
[07:43:51] <fof> im not sure active behaves as you expect it to
[07:44:50] <claudio> Hi. Seems like I have some "sync" issues with JSONP. Is it possible, in some scenarios (many "parallel" JSONP calls), that jQuery fails deleting the callbacks when they are still needed?
[07:45:14] <z0ned> ahh, i bet the preventDefault is what's fixing it.. you were probably previously being redirected without realizing it so the page was re-rendering?
[07:45:24] <fof> that too
[07:46:12] <claudio> (the problem is errors like "jsonp92384293482 is not defined")
[07:46:17] <elb0w> Question, http://pastie.org/3446929 on line 13 I am trying to bind a click function to this object im  creating. It seems to make all objects bind to "app" from the last iteration
[07:46:37] <elb0w> well call cm.manage(app) on the last created app
[07:47:25] <z0ned> Gergov, fof has posted the answer for you^^
[07:47:29] <danzik17> claudio: Can you make a jsfiddle demoing the error
[07:48:30] <claudio> danzik17, nope really :( It's a BIG codebase
[07:49:03] <claudio> danzik17, we integrate our code in many clients' pages, so...
[07:49:48] <danzik17> claudio: well, with no demo to see what's wrong, the only answer is "no, it should work fine"
[07:50:18] <claudio> danzik17, I know... I hoped that this "issue" was common :)
[07:51:41] <Gergov> hmm fof z0ned now its working.. i mean with preventDEfault() its working but it wont take me to my because of the preventDefault. so.. now what? any idea how to do it, after it takes me to the new link?
[07:52:11] <fof> what are you trying to do
[07:52:21] <Gergov> i am trying to change the currrent state of my navigation
[07:52:34] <fof> you want to highlight the menu item for the displayed page?
[07:52:45] <Gergov> yes
[07:53:13] <fof> then maybe select from the menu items to find the one for the page's url and highlight it that way
[07:53:21] <z0ned> Gergov, why do you want it on click?
[07:53:25] <z0ned> the user will never see it...
[07:53:32] <z0ned> also, this behavior is defined by CSS's blink property
[07:53:41] <Gergov> z0ned, because i was reading in google and there was .click() ..:)
[07:53:43] <z0ned> and it just flashes for a moment before being taken to the new page
[07:53:50] <z0ned> why don't you do it on hover?
[07:56:17] <fof> so, on dom ready you reset all the buttons to unhighlighted then select the one with an href matching the page and highlight that
[07:56:23] <Gergov> z0ned, i have sprite menu.. i have normal state, hover, and .active
[07:56:57] <fof> (not using active)
[07:57:34] <Gergov> fof, how to select the one matching the page?
[07:58:09] <Gergov> i am kind of a newbie. i was reading in google but i couldnt make it work so i joined the channel to ask :)
[07:58:55] <fof> window.location.pathname
[08:01:59] <fof> eg
[08:02:07] <fof> $(elems).each(function() {
[08:02:07] <fof>     if ($(this).attr('href') === window.location.pathname) {
[08:02:07] <fof>         $(this).addClass('hilight');
[08:02:07] <fof>     }​
[08:03:10] <Zogot> fof, any reason you can do this server side?
[08:03:24] <Zogot> you cant*
[08:03:28] <fof> you mean why not?
[08:03:33] <Zogot> aye
[08:04:05] <fof> why would you? :)
[08:04:36] <fof> this is just presentational stuff
[08:04:39] <io__> hi i am using a .click function to slideDown a div, but if I don t give width and height in css to the div before, the jquery slideDown doesn t work, it just appears
[08:05:14] <Zogot> fof: aye but presentational stuff that only happens once per page load, an aweful lot like a css class
[08:07:10] <fof> what would the mechanism be
[08:10:08] <djQuery> $('<li></li>', {text: 'WOW', 'class_name': 'test'}).appendTo('ul');   the new ul is not recieving the class test?
[08:11:37] <warrenparsons> io__: Does the div have any content?
[08:11:57] <djQuery> rather the li is not reciving the class
[08:13:04] <djQuery> nevermind got it
[08:13:25] <warrenparsons> djQuery: Try $('<li/>').text('WOW').addClass('test').appendTo...
[08:14:19] <djQuery> warrenparsons, like this syntax better  $('<li></li>', {text: 'WOW', 'class': 'test'}).appendTo('ul');
[08:14:23] <djQuery> and that works
[08:15:47] <djQuery> warrenparsons, and just for info I have seen ie blow up when you do $('<li/>') instead of $('<li></li>')
[08:16:12] <warrenparsons> djQuery: I've never had a problem with it in IE.
[08:16:22] <xckpd7> ajpiano: remember we talked about converting my application to backbone? This is my starting attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/QCjj4/11/
[08:16:50] <djQuery> .seen gnarf
[08:17:09] <xckpd7> ajpiano: nowhere near done (only works on click, no underscore template) but wanted to see if I was going in the right general direction
[08:18:37] <djQuery> gnarf, seem to be having a problem with newContent.    do I have to manualy call it when something is added to the dom? http://jsbin.com/acojev/edit#javascript,html,live
[08:18:41] <RichardP> hi, can anyone suggest a decent multiple select replacement which uses the original select to submit values?  Everything I can find replaces it with checkboxes or something else
[08:18:52] <RichardP> Im also avoiding JQuery UI
[08:19:13] <warrenparsons> RichardP: Give Chosen a try.
[08:19:15] <djQuery> ?tell gnarf seem to be having a problem with newContent.    do I have to manualy call it when something is added to the dom? http://jsbin.com/acojev/edit#javascript,html,live
[08:19:15] <bot-t> djQuery, Okay.
[08:20:30] <meekohi> Heya. Could someone explain to me what "this" refers to when used inside a jqueryUI factory widget? I have these $.proxy( … , this) all over my code and I don't really understand why.
[08:21:20] <felixqc> I'm opening dynamically a dialog and i use onclick="jQuery('<div></div>').dialog({ autoOpen: false, title: 'Product: Grosse vache', modal : true, height : 500, width : 600, draggable : false, resizable: false, closeOnEscape: true, buttons: { Close: function(event, ui) { $(this).dialog('close') } } }).load('/app_dev.php/api/items/show/9',  function() { $('#accordion').accordion('destroy').accordion({
[08:21:20] <felixqc> autoHeight: false, navigation: true });}).dialog('open');"
[08:21:31] <ajpiano> meekohi: it refers to the widget instance
[08:21:51] <felixqc> but my dialog opens on an empty page, then loads the html inside
[08:22:05] <ajpiano> xckpd7: it looks deece but definitely needs a lot more sophistication so to speak
[08:22:08] <ajpiano> but you'll get there
[08:22:16] <ajpiano> xckpd7: for a simple one, don't use globals
[08:22:17] <meekohi> ajpiano: but if I call a member function from inside _create for example, then what is "this" ?
[08:22:19] <felixqc> is there a callback on the .load so i can make my dialog appear after there's some html inside?
[08:22:31] <ajpiano> i know that silly backbone demo has them as globs but it is not good
[08:23:11] <RichardP> warrenparsons: thanks - but it doesnt bode well when the projects demo page doesnt work :)  "turn this ... into this ..." and both are identical :D
[08:23:35] <xckpd7> ajpiano: most definitely... just wanted to see if I was moving in the right direction. thanks
[08:23:46] <ajpiano> no prob
[08:23:59] <djQuery> felixqc, you could .load the div then open the div as a dialog after it has loaded using the callback of .load
[08:24:14] <djQuery> ?load@felixqc
[08:24:14] <bot-t> felixqc, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:24:16] <warrenparsons> RichardP: On this page? http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ They all work for me.
[08:25:22] <djQuery> felixqc, but as long as you are doing inline javascript you are going to have trouble troubleshooting etc
[08:25:30] <djQuery> felixqc, http://api.jquery.com/load/
[08:26:48] <felixqc> djQuery: i could to a .dialog('close')
[08:26:51] <RichardP> warrenparsons: aha, second visit to the page and something happens :D
[08:27:09] <felixqc> and add $(this).dialog('open') on the .load callback?
[08:27:40] <djQuery> felixqc, $('<div></div>', {title: 'whatever'}).load('url', function(){$(this).dialog();})
[08:28:09] <RichardP> warrenparsons: hmmm, it doesnt seem to update the original select with the chosen values :/
[08:28:14] <djQuery> of course I left out all the options u had
[08:28:30] <cannonball> Good morning all.  I use ajaxForm for a quick and dirty internal email address search page.  It works just fine, no questions about the operation of it. But...
[08:28:40] <warrenparsons> RichardP: It does for me.
[08:29:12] <cannonball> Sometimes I want to pass a URL to a coworker, something like "/smtpauth/?email=user@example.com"
[08:29:24] <xckpd7> question: if you wanted to capture an input's value based on click & enter, you would have to write out a click event and a keypress, correct? or is there a simpler way to do it
[08:30:09] <RichardP> warrenparsons: looking at it in firebug etc and it doesnt set the selected value on the option - I wonder if its just something firebug isnt doing
[08:30:10] <felixqc> djQuery: thank's, it works! but, is there a way to add something before the call also?
[08:30:11] <cannonball> I'm stumbling a bit when trying to figure out how to "notice" that there are options passed in the url and shove those into my form fields and then .submit() them.  Any URL's that might point me in the right direction?
[08:30:14] <djQuery> xckpd7, no, .bind('click blur whateverotherevent', function(){})
[08:30:34] <djQuery> felixqc, clarify
[08:30:39] <felixqc> like the beforeSend of the ajax
[08:30:57] <warrenparsons> RichardP: Hard to say. In practice I've never had any such problems with it. Updating the Chosen proxy triggers the 'change' event on the select, reading the value of the select at that time returns the correct value, etc.
[08:30:59] <felixqc> because i have 2-3 seconds waiting until the dialog opens
[08:31:28] <RichardP> warrenparsons: ok, will give it a shot, cheers :)
[08:32:04] <warrenparsons> RichardP: I also hacked it slightly to remove the text-entry field on the last site where I used it because it wasn't appropriate.
[08:32:46] <djQuery> felixqc, then dont do that, append a loading div to the div that you are dialoging. open the dialog div immediately and set the loading to have a z-index of 999    then once the loading is done hide\remove the loading div
[08:33:05] <djQuery> this way people see that somethig is actualy happening
[08:34:16] <djQuery> felixqc, but doing this all with inline scripting (ie click='buncha messed up javascript') is not going to be very pretty or maintanable
[08:36:46] <felixqc> djQuery: it is on a loop of "fnRowCallback":
[08:36:53] <felixqc> for datatables
[08:38:20] <djQuery> felixqc, not familar with datatables but couldnt you just put a class on it then do a $('table').on('classname', 'click', function(){ cool stuff here})
[08:38:35] <djQuery> ?on@felixqc
[08:38:36] <bot-t> felixqc, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:39:20] <felixqc> if i do: $('#somediv').dialog().html('<div>moooo</div>').load('some/page')
[08:41:22] <felixqc> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/zNa6G/
[08:41:32] <djQuery> felixqc, var $somediv =  $('#somediv').addClass('wiating').dialog().load('some/page', function(){ $somediv.removeClass('loading');});
[08:41:49] <RichardP> warrenparsons: works perfectly, thankyou very much - got any other great recommendations in general? :)
[08:43:01] <djQuery> felixqc, where is this coming from? ozyx_item_show
[08:43:18] <felixqc> that's a path... it is a twig template..
[08:43:31] <felixqc> it outputs: /path/to/some/controller
[08:51:26] <felixqc> djQuery: anyway, it is just some nice finishing... many thank's :)
[08:53:25] <djQuery> felixqc, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/zNa6G/1/
[08:53:41] <xckpd7> question: isn't it expensive to continuously check on an input for keypresses of enter ("13")?
[08:53:47] <djQuery> course you will need to edit a little got tired of getting rid of all the '
[08:54:02] <xckpd7> I know you can bind a keypress and check if the code is 13, however I wonder if that is a little expensive
[08:54:15] <xckpd7> or if there is even an alternative
[08:54:24] <peterschmidler> What's wrong with this?     $(".item").eq(i).find(".item-page".).eq(j).css("background-color", "#000");
[08:54:55] <jonclark> there's a period after page"
[08:54:55] <fof> the extra fullstop in the find?
[08:56:00] <djQuery> peterschmidler, ".item-page".     versus  ".item-page"
[08:56:13] <peterschmidler> jonclark: Yes! Eagle's eye ;)
[08:56:38] <peterschmidler> jonclark: djQuery: fof: Thanks

[09:15:30] <eddiemonge> Jon30: the class names shouldnt have periods for easy use
[09:15:48] <eddiemonge> otherwise you have to escape it in your selector

[09:16:45] <Jon30> i have a <li class="one two">    how do i get $('.one').click to work? $('.one*').click didnt' do the trick
[09:16:49] <ajpiano> bartmax: sorry can't even approach thinking about anything right now
[09:16:52] <eddiemonge> Jon30: whats the problem then? $('.one').click( ... ) should work
[09:17:00] <bartmax> ajpiano: ok, np! sorry to bother.
[09:17:21] <bartmax> and thanks for the reply tho.
[09:17:21] <Jon30> for some reason it doesn't, i assumed it's because the li has class="one two" instead of just class="one"

[09:20:22] <birrddog> Anyone have a pointer on how I can breakup jquery ui tabs to be loaded from remote files (one for each tab), though have the ability to communicate with each other? Right now I do $("#tab-X").load("remotefile.html") for each tab, though I need to be able to share functions and objects between them, I am not sure how to best do this?
[09:21:36] <birrddog> (my purpose is to share a websocket between multiple tabs)
[09:24:55] <eddiemonge> birrddog: you should be able to since the functions unless you have the scope for those functions and things limited
[09:25:13] <eddiemonge> in which case you might want to have them extend your custom namespace

[09:29:48] <eddiemonge> anywhere?
[09:29:50] <LukeNukem> i mean what is the selector to use

[09:44:03] <CodeZombie> trying to get IE to calculate clicked position, in a scaled element inside a div with overflow hidden... Every other browser displays the menu at the correct location, but IE doesn't seem to work well with the transformed scaling. https://gist.github.com/41d87d322eb6cbb479cb I assume I need to do some math with the scale value, but I can't seem to nail it down... scale values are like 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, etc... Any help would be greatly appreciated.

[09:49:17] <CodeZombie> code has changed slightly, let me give it another go with fiddle
[09:49:24] <eddiemonge> CodeZombie: press the JSLint button on that fiddle
[10:00:32] <xckpd7> can anyone take a look at this backbone app and tell me why it's throwing a console error?
[10:01:09] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: sure, post the link
[10:01:31] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/QCjj4/21/
[10:01:35] <xckpd7> sorry I was adding details
[10:01:55] <xckpd7> I don't think I entirely grok the passing references deal
[10:02:02] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: whre is your bindall
[10:02:06] <johnkpaul> you removed bindall
[10:02:10] <johnkpaul> so "this" refers to the window
[10:02:25] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: so you notice that I'm using this in multiple places....
[10:02:32] <xckpd7> basically if you go and add a todo, everything works
[10:02:42] <xckpd7> the only "this" that doesn't work, is the this.clearAndFocus()
[10:02:45] <xckpd7> thie other this's work
[10:02:57] <xckpd7> I have no idea why as I don't completely grok it yet
[10:02:58] <johnkpaul> taht's because render is called in a differnet context
[10:03:15] <nobitanobi1> is there any shorter way to do $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[10:03:18] <johnkpaul> backbone calls render internally
[10:03:24] <johnkpaul> nobitanobi1: $(functiongoeshere)
[10:03:48] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: ok so I would do the bindAll?
[10:03:52] <johnkpaul> yes, you have to
[10:03:59] <johnkpaul> or "this" will not be your view
[10:04:54] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: that works perfectly, but I'm afraid I don't quite get it... so basically the reason it doesn't work, is that?
[10:05:06] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: I'm at work on a call
[10:05:09] <johnkpaul> but when I'm done, I will explain
[10:05:14] <xckpd7> thx
[10:09:26] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: in the mean time, this might help http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/

[10:12:25] <nonotza> I need to make 2 conflicting versions of jquery lib place nice with each other on one page. is there a way for one jquery library to return one alias (eg. jQuery1) and the other library to return another alias (eg. jQuery2) ?
[10:13:59] <kenperkins> nonotza: have you looked up noConflict?
[10:14:07] <nonotza> yes
[10:14:35] <nonotza> if I call it, how does the code know which library to use?
[10:15:43] <eddiemonge> nonotza: you call it right after you include the lib
[10:15:56] <eddiemonge> but the real question is, why do you want to different versions of jQuery?
[10:16:02] <kenperkins> here
[10:16:05] <nonotza> for different plugins
[10:16:10] <kenperkins> http://www.clipboard.com/clip/LQpUtdrLqQlZ_ncRtFR_XzbgUEBTj6Ex2R1e
[10:16:13] <kenperkins> do that nonotza
[10:16:26] <nonotza> awesome, thanks
[10:16:43] <kenperkins> i very seriously considered lmgtfy.com
[10:16:45] <kenperkins> but I was nice
[10:17:04] <eddiemonge> nonotza: why do you want to do that?
[10:17:19] <kenperkins> we do that on clipboard eddiemonge
[10:17:27] <nonotza> well, if I use only one version of jquery (the latest) - one plugin doesn't work
[10:18:50] <eddiemonge> kenperkins: why?
[10:19:12] <eddiemonge> nonotza: contact the plugin author to see if there is an upgrade or look at fixing it yourself. what plugin is it?
[10:19:44] <nonotza> jroller
[10:20:02] <eddiemonge> honestly, i think, except for a very few edge cases, having to include multiple version of jquery signifies something not good
[10:20:06] <kenperkins> eddiemonge: we load a bookmarklet onto a third party domain
[10:20:11] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: so when you define a function, by itself, this isn't bound to anything
[10:20:16] <kenperkins> we have no control over what is on the page, so we have to use noConflict
[10:20:19] <johnkpaul> the value of this is only set when the function is called
[10:20:22] <kenperkins> to make sure we don't' fuck with the page
[10:20:25] <johnkpaul> and what it is set to, depends on how it is called
[10:20:43] <jlebrech> can anyone have a look at this for me? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9435923/how-to-load-jquery-autocomplete-items-over-json
[10:21:19] <eddiemonge> kenperkins: like i said, edge case. but really, you should check to see if jquery is included already, then check compatibility, then load a different version if absolutely necessary
[10:21:57] <xarxer> Trying to build a neat menu with jQuery, and this is what I've got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/7v5gS/4/ Though, it's not working.. Notice what happens when you press Cables > Network..
[10:22:13] <xarxer> Any ideas why this happens? Can't really spot the problem in my code..
[10:22:20] <johnkpaul> is you call the function on an object like myObject.myFunction() then if myFunction has a reference to "this", that reference will point to myObject
[10:22:32] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: thats not a very good structure. you basically have three different arrays of completely different data/keys/values
[10:22:48] <kenperkins> eddiemonge: we do
[10:23:03] <kenperkins> but ineviteably we have to do noConflict
[10:23:32] <eddiemonge> kenperkins: like i said, thats an edge case and not anywhere near the norm
[10:23:57] <kenperkins> I didn't mean to imply it was the norm :)
[10:23:58] <xckpd7> Ok
[10:24:08] <jlebrech> eddiemonge: i see, so i should be writing {Name:"ASP", Value:"red"} instead of {"name":"red"}
[10:24:39] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: so the reason render needs bindAll passed to it and not the other functions
[10:25:37] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: has to do with the way render is being called... that being part of the deal of the observer pattern and being bound to the model?
[10:25:41] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: something like that?
[10:26:15] <eddiemonge> jlebrech: yes
[10:26:19] <neataroni> is there a common pattern for preserving the openess or closedness of a sliding div when you refresh?
[10:26:22] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: yes, something like that, at the time render is called, the event system doesn't know what particular view bound that function
[10:26:31] <johnkpaul> because render could be called from differnt contexts
[10:26:59] <johnkpaul> but if you call bindall, that doesn't matter
[10:27:12] <eddiemonge> neataroni: usually you use hash location and then check that on page load to trigger whats open
[10:27:16] <johnkpaul> because it wraps the function in a context that forces this to always be set to the same thing
[10:27:26] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: ok so usually in views when I'm rendering stuff and that stuff is bound to something and not called directly in the view, use bindAll to get what I want
[10:27:39] <xckpd7> something like that.... I get what you mean thouhg
[10:28:34] <neataroni> eddiemonge: what do you mean by hash location?
[10:28:59] <shinobi> looking for help on this probably simple problem http://paste2.org/p/1914836
[10:29:06] <xckpd7> johnkpaul++
[10:30:19] <xarxer> No one?
[10:30:24] <eddiemonge> neataroni: location.hash or you can use cookies or localStorage or any other methods. hash is the one you want to use if you want to be able to distribute links
[10:31:11] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: whenever you don't control when a function is being invoked, you should use bindall
[10:31:31] <johnkpaul> in your example, you don't call this.render(), you pass this.render to this.todos.bind(
[10:31:38] <johnkpaul> so since you're not calling it yourself, you need to bindall
[10:31:43] <eddiemonge> xarxer: any reason you dont want to use a suckerfish style menu?
[10:31:46] <johnkpaul> also, it doesn't hurt to call binall on a function
[10:31:50] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: brilliant, you finally got it to click in my mind
[10:31:55] <johnkpaul> so you might find tutorials that just call bindall on everything
[10:31:57] <johnkpaul> great!
[10:32:03] <johnkpaul> have fun with your new knowledge :)
[10:32:08] <xckpd7> johnkpaul: thanks
[10:32:59] <xarxer> eddiemonge: What's that?
[10:33:11] <xarxer> eddiemonge: But I think I solved it
[10:33:11] <shinobi> any ideas on what i'm doing wrong? http://paste2.org/p/1914836
[10:34:02] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[10:34:37] <eddiemonge> xarxer: an almost completely CSS way to solve what you are doing. http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/
[10:34:54] <JonnyCash> anyone know if it's possible in jquery/css3/html5 to do an animation of a pen writing?
[10:34:58] <neybar> is there an easy way to scroll up page up by how ever much of a block is hanging below the fold?  I have a series of panels that one can show/hide.  If the panels contents will open below the fold then I want to scroll the page up a bit.  I've been using .animate({ scrollTop: X }), but that is moving it too far.  Is there a scrollBottom or something similar I'm missing?
[10:35:14] <gnarf> djQuery: thats exactly how its supposed to work
[10:35:18] <eddiemonge> xarxer: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/7v5gS/9/
[10:35:27] <gnarf> you call it on new content, and it searches for callbacks you've registered
[10:35:59] <djQuery> gnarf but if you add without calling it, it does nothing.
[10:36:06] <gnarf> exactly
[10:36:20] <djQuery> darn, wont be much use with knockout.js
[10:36:22] <gnarf> $( someContent ).newContent()
[10:39:19] <eddiemonge> shinobi: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/qS7yg/
[10:39:34] <eddiemonge> JonnyCash: if you use canvas sure
[10:39:47] <eddiemonge> JonnyCash: otherwise not so easy
[10:39:51] <JonnyCash> eddiemonge
[10:40:06] <JonnyCash> im not a developer myself
[10:40:11] <JonnyCash> canvas is a jquery function?
[10:40:15] <Phoenixz> I can extend (for example) the String object using prototype.. Now, I'd like to have a very simple own built object to javascript function (which works well as function) added to the object prototype... Tried that with something like Object.prototype.toMyArray = function(){}  but that gives a problem, according to browser, actually in jQuery.. Is this a jQuery problem or javascript problem?
[10:40:16] <JonnyCash> or is it some sort of app?
[10:40:29] <Phoenixz> JonnyCash: canvas is an HTML element
[10:40:38] <xarxer> eddiemonge: thanks for the snippet :)
[10:40:40] <JonnyCash> to clarify- there wont actually be a pen- it will just reveal writing as if it were being written (sort of like a flash effect)
[10:40:43] <Phoenixz> JonnyCash: An HTML5 element, to be exact
[10:40:48] <eddiemonge> JonnyCash: if you arent a developer then shouldnt your developer be asking?
[10:40:58] <JonnyCash> no because my developer said it's not possible
[10:40:59] <JonnyCash> without flash
[10:41:05] <JonnyCash> so im here to do some research
[10:41:13] <eddiemonge> JonnyCash: time for a new developer maybe
[10:41:17] <Phoenixz> JonnyCash: Ah, gotta love the "its not possible without flash" :)
[10:41:26] <JonnyCash> yeah i dunno- not really here to discuss that :)
[10:41:29] <Phoenixz> JonnyCash: what eddiemonge says..
[10:41:45] <JonnyCash> im just wondering if it is possible?
[10:41:54] <Antaranian> JonnyCash: he meant it's not possible without flash with my salary and timeframe
[10:42:01] <JonnyCash> ok :)
[10:42:12] <JonnyCash> let's not steer too far off topic
[10:42:43] <eddiemonge> JonnyCash: or he meant, its not possible because im too lazy to google how to do it
[10:42:50] <JonnyCash> cool
[10:42:58] <eddiemonge> which brings us around to my original points
[10:43:12] <eddiemonge> canvas with a new dev
[10:44:06] <neybar> JonnyCash: you could do what you are asking, but you will be limiting the number of browers that can see it.  Sort of depends on what your target audience is.
[10:46:10] <JonnyCash> ok guys i am in html5
[10:46:14] <eddiemonge> neybar: canvas is pretty universal at this point
[10:46:15] <JonnyCash> thanks so much for responding to me though
[10:46:19] <Antaranian> neybar: excanvas does the trick.. well, most of time
[10:46:20] <JonnyCash> you helped me a lot
[10:47:01] <neybar> exactly.  is the (.. well, most of the time) bit :)
[10:47:15] <neybar> I was just adding the caution is all.
[10:50:03] <shinobi> eddiemonge: is the stuff you sent me any better than this? http://pastie.org/3448625 what I wanted was a method that could be used with multiple divs/anchors
[10:50:22] <friedbyte> I have a list of links and I want to create a prev and next links that will click through my list of links . . . is there a name for that? where I would click on a next link, and it fires the link from the list . . .
[10:52:12] <eddiemonge> shinobi: i dont remember. your line 4 doesnt need the $() around the anchro since its already a jQ object from line 3
[10:52:56] <eddiemonge> shinobi: and dont count on .css('display') === none unless you are explicitly setting that. thats why i used is(":visible")
[10:53:28] <eddiemonge> shinobi: and the return false isnt neeeded. add e.preventDefault() before or after the if/else loop see ? preventDefault
[10:53:28] <bot-t> shinobi, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:59:46] <shinobi> hmm maybe I'm just trying to refactor this too much
[11:01:14] <LekeFly> function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){ $('.fancybox-thumb').trigger('click'); } How can i change the selector here from .fancybox-thumb to the variable image_anchor?
[11:01:29] <shinobi> i have several of these divs/anchors that when you click the anchor the div slideToggles and the anchor's html changes, so i figured writing one method that takes in a div to slide and an anchor to change the text of (when clicked) would be a good idea lol
[11:04:25] <eddiemonge> shinobi: if you do it as a plugin it would be easier
[11:04:47] <shinobi> eddiemonge: i don't understand
[11:05:02] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: what would the variable be? a selector, a DOM element, a jq object?
[11:05:14] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: a image
[11:05:38] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: if you click the "1" image here
[11:05:39] <LekeFly> http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html
[11:05:48] <LekeFly> It doesnt open the correct one
[11:06:33] <eddiemonge> shinobi: based on your code, there was only one div/anchor
[11:06:57] <shinobi> eddiemonge: i know, but there are other pieces of html that want to do same thing on that page, although a different div/anchor
[11:07:21] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: you dont need multiple .ready() blocks. you can combine them
[11:07:35] <eddiemonge> shinobi what would be the relationship?
[11:07:44] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: yeah i know.. just trowing it together to test : )
[11:07:50] <LekeFly> But i guess that wont be the error :p
[11:08:33] <sam113101> is $("#lol") the same as document.getElementById("lol")?
[11:08:44] <sam113101> doesn't seem like it
[11:08:57] <shinobi> eddiemonge: imagine 5 long paragraphs, each one wish a special div and anchor to view more, or view less of the paragraph, each anchor for each paragraph would correspond to each div for each paragraph, so one div/anchor per paragraph
[11:09:07] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: i need to "use the selector to grab the link that contains the image with that image anchor"
[11:09:56] <shakakai> sam113101: not exactly, jquery wraps DOM elements standardizing their properties/methods
[11:10:15] <sam113101> ok
[11:10:46] <shakakai> sam113101: but your selector is correct to grab an element w/ an id of "lol"
[11:16:39] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a "simple" jquery selector.. ? i have this: "function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){$('.fancybox-thumb').trigger('click');}" but i need to change the selector to grab the link that contains the image with that image anchor
[11:18:59] <nobitanobi1> I have a click listener in an anchor tag. How do I prevent the default ?
[11:19:28] <Zzaichik> oooh
[11:19:36] <Zzaichik> That would make an awesome questionfor Google
[11:19:48] <Zzaichik> jquery prevent default event
[11:20:12] <Zzaichik> lmgtfy material
[11:20:36] <nobitanobi1> Zzaichik: I was wondering if the live method is used to prevent default.
[11:20:59] <Whirl3d> zzaichik, in the amount of time you spent replying you could have typed: e.preventDefault or even ?.preventDefault@....   would have been easier and nicer for everyone involved.
[11:21:01] <eddiemonge> shinobi: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/qS7yg/1/
[11:21:10] <Zzaichik> nah
[11:21:19] <Zzaichik> its all about you figuring it out for yourself
[11:21:42] <nobitanobi1> if I enter here is because I've tried
[11:21:47] <nobitanobi1> and I haven't been able to figure out
[11:21:58] <nobitanobi1> but I recommend you just ignoring if you don't want to answer >)
[11:21:59] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i dont see where you are calling etalage_click_callback
[11:22:04] <Whirl3d> This is a valid resource. Googling it or getting advice (which may come with extra information about exception cases and such) are both ways of figuring it out yourself
[11:22:08] <thang> but if youre not going to contribute, its counter productive to tell them to try it themself
[11:22:12] <Zzaichik> sorry - a lot of peeps haven't tried anything, they just come in here and ask.
[11:22:16] <recur> Anyone have a link to the jquerytools scripts?  Their CDN is down :)
[11:22:43] <eddiemonge> ? preventdefault @ nobitanobi1
[11:22:43] <bot-t> nobitanobi1, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:22:48] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Could i pm? - its at the bottom at the page inside a <script>
[11:22:59] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i didnt see it in the link
[11:23:05] <LekeFly> function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor)
[11:23:14] <LekeFly> Its there open source and search
[11:23:40] <eddiemonge> yeah, i see the function. i dont see where its called
[11:23:54] <Zzaichik> next time I'll do what eddie did
[11:24:04] <LekeFly> Oh.. its created from jquery.etalage.min.js
[11:24:17] <nobitanobi1> thanks eddiemonge
[11:24:50] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i dont think thats the correct way to do it but i could be wrong
[11:24:50] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge is a real pro, but he does get abused by people who won't try it for themselves. He's pretty good at sussing out the trolls though.
[11:25:11] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: thanks!
[11:25:17] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: It returns the image link onclick.. its a function of the plugin for using lightboxes
[11:25:32] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Did you see that it opened the wrong image tho?
[11:26:19] <eddiemonge> not really. inside that function, do console.log(this) and see whats returned in the console. that might give you some ideas
[11:30:05] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Hmm i know what it does wrong and how to fix it.. i just dont know what the selector would be.. "callback provides you with the variable "image_anchor" that's the path to the image you've just clicked use the selector to grab the link that contains the image with that image anchor"
[11:31:09] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: did you do what i said?
[11:33:24] <sam113101> how do I change an object into JSON
[11:33:30] <sam113101> or into text should I say
[11:33:39] <pendlepants> sam113101: JSON.stringify(obj)
[11:33:58] <pendlepants> that assumes a modern browser that has JSON support.
[11:37:29] <monk12> hey all, i have a page that looks like '<div id="current_question"><form ...>... </form></div>'... when i get a new question via ajax, i want to remove the form element, aka unwrapping it... but i think .unwrap() can't be applied easily since it uses the elements parents, and there just might be a mess of info in form so can't target those to unwrap() its parent... I want to do something like $('#latest_question form').unwrapThisElement();
[11:38:10] <monk12> Anyone know of a core function/way to do that?
[11:38:21] <nFFF> ?remove
[11:38:21] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[11:39:13] <monk12> nFFF, thats not what i want... remove removes form and everything inside of it... i just want to remove <form> tag and leave contents undisturbed.
[11:40:31] <nFFF> $('form').replaceWith($('form').html()) ;?
[11:40:58] <monk12> nFFF, cool :)  that makes sense, thanks!
[11:41:03] <nFFF> :>
[11:41:52] <monk12> i guess that makes the html invalid. since the ajax submit works off of name of form field. i could just strip the <form name="..." ...> down to <form> to keep it valid html

[11:45:06] <LekeFly> console.log(); :S ?
[11:45:10] <ikks> I'm reading http://api.jquery.com/submit/ , but I don't understand the expression "The JavaScript submit event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. However, scripts that rely on event delegation with the submit event will work consistently across browsers as of jQuery 1.4, which has normalized the event's behavior."
[11:45:35] <ikks> Does it mean, it does not work on IE and I have to use .on('form','submit') instead ?
[11:45:55] <nFFF> LekeFly ...
[11:46:53] <LekeFly> nFFF: Was just thinking its abit much information to say here.. wanna take it here instead?
[11:47:10] <JBP641> Hi, if I'm loading content from an external div…does it have to be a properly formed .html document or can it just be <div id=blah>what I want to get here</div>
[11:48:02] <monk12> nFFF,  so I show question 1 in a survey ... its in a structure like <div id="current_questeion" class="ajax_question"><form name="ajaxForm">...question ...radio1... radio2</form></div>... jquery event looks for $('form[name=ajaxForm]').submit(...  So when i submit i .serialize() the data in the form and send to save in database... then the json returns the next question... which i display on same page (after greying out the first question's inputs)...
[11:48:02] <monk12>  This 2nd question has its own <form name="ajaxForm">... so since i don't want serialize() to pick up the previous question's  to submit, so i  probably should remove the name="ajaxForm" from the 1st questions <form>... but i shouldn't remove the <form> entirely since it makes the radio buttons inside first question invalid html without a <form> parent.
[11:48:47] <nFFF> ikks, it means that when you have the .submit binded to a child element, it doesn't bubble up the DOM tree to the parent
[11:48:51] <nFFF> Where as with other events it will
[11:48:57] <monk12> (I basically want no chance of accidentally submitting old forms values.)
[11:49:17] <monk12> not sure thats the best way to do something like that, but what im going with for now.
[11:49:28] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: put exactly what i said.
[11:49:29] <cyberrog> how do I parse a json in this format [{"name":"john"},{"name":"peter"}]
[11:49:39] <ikks> ok nFFF I understand, thx
[11:49:58] <nFFF> monk12, why the bunch of ajax requests?
[11:50:05] <nFFF> Cant you load all questions in one request
[11:50:08] <cyberrog> Im trying to use parseJSON but it doesnt work
[11:50:17] <ikks> JBP641 you only need the html chunk, not a "complete" page
[11:50:38] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: i have tryed to figure out where it should be placed since you said it.. google gives me alot but i dont know exactly where to put it..
[11:50:56] <cyberrog> any idea?
[11:51:38] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: put it in the function
[11:51:38] <monk12> nFFF, to get the next question we have a custom language to interpret current answer, with may be other information about the survery.. its a bit complex and hacky. but the language already implemented java-side and hard to translate to javascript (not a simple "if(radio=A&&C), get this question") hence why each makes round-trip to server to figure out next question.
[11:51:52] <eddiemonge> cyberrog: how are you getting that?
[11:52:01] <cyberrog> eddiemonge from a php script
[11:52:15] <nobitanobi1> I have a div element like this: <div id="get_more" data-item_id = "348555399847215106" > and I'm trying to get the data-item_id by using: var last_id = $('#get_more').attr("data-item_id"); -- is not letting me to. Why?
[11:52:24] <nFFF> monk12, can you need give each form an ID?
[11:52:27] <nFFF> and submit the id?
[11:52:43] <cyberrog> eddiemonge I validated it and its correct. but parseJSON dont success when parsing.
[11:53:01] <nFFF> ?demo @ nobitanobi1
[11:53:02] <bot-t> nobitanobi1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:53:36] <eddiemonge> cyberrog: not what i asked. how are you getting that json. or from where i should say
[11:54:15] <cyberrog> eddiemonge from a php script that select the data from database and write the json
[11:55:05] <eddiemonge> cyberrog: so you are getting it from an ajax call? or is the php writing that to the page?
[11:56:36] <monk12> nFFF, not following,... whats that solve? Right now, I have a catch-all event to know when ajax submits a form $('form[name=AjaxForm]').submit(...);  ... i could i guess do $('form#latestForm').submit(...); and just remove latestForm on old form, and put it on the latest question's <form> coming in through ajax.
[11:56:54] <JBP641> ok…so what am I doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/95fbU6U1
[11:57:05] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Im really not finding any information on where i should put it.. you say function but docs or google doesnt really say where
[11:57:06] <monk12> its basically same thing though, so think maybe you have something else in mind.
[11:57:54] <nFFF> monk12, your ajax request returns a new identical form correct?
[11:58:04] <nFFF> And your concerned its going to resubmit the old form data?
[11:59:11] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: omg. put it in your callback function where you have that trigger
[11:59:33] <JBP641> ikks: any idea what I'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/95fbU6U1
[12:00:36] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){
[12:00:36] <LekeFly> $('.fancybox-thumb', console.log).trigger('click'); } ? :S
[12:00:42] <nFFF> JBP641, why not put some console.log()'s in there
[12:00:46] <nFFF> and see what data returns etc
[12:00:49] <nFFF> which line is failing?
[12:00:57] <nFFF> line 6?
[12:01:18] <nFFF> Have your tried .html().replaceWith()?
[12:01:26] <monk12> nFFF,  well, it returns the same wrapping structure (pretend i unset #latest_question since have to have unique id first:), but ajax basically returns <div id="latest_question" class="ajax_question"><form name="ajaxForm">...new question.. checkBox1 checkBox2</form></div>... its a 1 page ajax survey... I am worried its goign to resubmit the old form data if i had a <form> wrapping the entire questionaire which was my first thought... so i have individu
[12:01:26] <monk12> al form elements... and target ajax submit of only a specific form element (whether by name or id, but i have to remove the old name/id off the <form> to have a catch-all event)
[12:01:37] <JBP641> nfff, I don't know which line is failing
[12:01:48] <nFFF> JBP641, then do some alerts or console.logs???
[12:01:50] <eddiemonge> ? ftj @ LekeFly
[12:01:50] <bot-t> LekeFly, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:01:56] <nFFF> why wouldnt you do that first...
[12:02:01] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: read that and then you should understand
[12:02:02] <JBP641> I don't know javascript
[12:02:09] <nFFF> so why are you writing it?
[12:02:10] <JBP641> lemme lookup console.logs
[12:02:10] <JBP641> lol
[12:02:12] <shinobi> eddiemonge: could you explain what the (jQuery) line is for in that code?
[12:02:14] <nFFF> alert()
[12:02:17] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Alright thanks.. reading
[12:02:17] <nFFF> ?alert
[12:02:17] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:02:19] <JBP641> learning dude ;)
[12:02:30] <nFFF> IT basically alerts or logs your variable
[12:02:38] <JBP641> ah ok
[12:02:44] <nFFF> so put alert(var)
[12:02:44] <eddiemonge> shinobi: i dont always know if jQuery is using $ so you pass in jQuery
[12:02:58] <nFFF> after each var and see where it fails/the vairbales return what you expect
[12:02:59] <JBP641> will that work in chrome console too?
[12:03:15] <JBP641> gotcha
[12:03:18] <nFFF> yes
[12:03:26] <cyberrog> eddiemonge ajax call
[12:03:38] <Hombretao> hi there people, i a looking for some help with the validation of a form made only with radio-type input http://jsfiddle.net/PtNAn/
[12:04:10] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: But why would i want to know the errors or what is returning? i know that. i just dont know what to insert into the selector so it uses the image_anchor
[12:04:15] <eddiemonge> cyberrog: then you shouldnt need to use parseJSON. If you specify  json as the dataType then it will parse it for you
[12:04:42] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){ console.log(this, image_anchor); }
[12:04:55] <nFFF> monk12, I mean this: var formcount = 0; $('form[name=AjaxForm]').attr('id','ajaxform'+formcount);
[12:04:56] <eddiemonge> put that in, and then look at what gets put into the console when you click
[12:05:05] <nFFF> And then increment formcount in the callback of your ajax
[12:05:13] <nFFF> and submit the current formcount
[12:05:41] <nFFF> $('#ajaxform'+formcount).submit()
[12:05:52] <cyberrog> got it.
[12:07:13] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Window image-gallery-demo.html img/galleryAssets/1.jpg
[12:07:18] <LekeFly> I already knew that..
[12:07:35] <JBP641> nfff: when I did alert(content); it was blank so I guess it's not getting the data from /call/go
[12:07:35] <Hombretao> i have loop in here http://jsfiddle.net/PtNAn/ but i dont know how to use it in order to make it validate each input :(
[12:07:43] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: why are there 3 things?
[12:08:03] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: 3 things as in?
[12:08:16] <nFFF> JBP641, did alert(data) ok?
[12:08:44] <JBP641> ohhhh wow
[12:08:49] <ProLoser|Work> any good way to remove undefined values from an object literal?
[12:08:52] <JBP641> there's my problem
[12:08:57] <ProLoser|Work> i want to do $.param() but some keys have undefined values
[12:09:08] <monk12> nFFF, looking at that made me realize... They may click on a greyed-out div of old question on same page... like $('.ajax_question').click(...) ... and i might be re-submitting an old question (changing an answer). so i guess currently the catch-all could be I re-add #latest_question back onto that div... and change my catch-all submit to $('#latest_question form').submit() and that could be easiier than looking for specific id's.
[12:09:19] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: as in you listed three things
[12:09:36] <nFFF> monk12, whichever way you want to do it
[12:09:40] <nFFF> it's an easy problem
[12:10:07] <nFFF> Your forms simply need to be unique if you only want to submit one at a time...
[12:10:25] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Listed three things where? IRC? the site? what i pasted?
[12:11:01] <ProLoser|Work> how can i strip out undefined values from an object literal? like {foo:'val',bar:undefined}
[12:11:06] <monk12> nFFF, k :). Thanks man, made me realize my original ajax catch-all wouldn't handle that. by putting #latest_question on only the current question, then i think the selector $('#latest_question form').... for the ajax submit can figure out easily which form you actually trying to submit
[12:11:22] <JBP641> nfff: booya grandma!  thanks
[12:11:28] <nFFF> :>>
[12:11:35] <monk12> haha.^
[12:12:01] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, I'm trying to bind a click event to every anchor under an element who's class is NOT .locate-btn -- I have $('.container a:not(.locate-btn)' but I'm still binding an event to that element; can anyone help me with where I misunderstood :not?
[12:12:57] <nFFF> ProLoser|Work, im not sure about a native mehod
[12:13:03] <nFFF> but you can use $.map
[12:13:13] <nFFF> and do it hat way. but there could be an easier way
[12:13:18] <nFFF> ?$.map
[12:13:19] <bot-t> nFFF, .map() - Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:13:49] <Hombretao> ok, i cleand this up a little, i have a problem with this function http://jsfiddle.net/XwNEe/ i should be able to check every input with it, but somehow it just check right if i write each input a part
[12:15:26] <sam113101> why can't I do this alert($("#room.chatbox").html())?
[12:15:38] <nFFF> Actually map only works on arrays not object literals :|
[12:16:14] <sam113101> alert($("#room.chatbox")[0].html()) doesn't work either
[12:16:29] <nFFF> alert($("#room.chatbox").length);
[12:17:13] <sam113101> 0, wtf
[12:17:31] <sam113101> it means class chatbox in id room, right?
[12:17:32] <nFFF> your elemen doesnt exist sir
[12:18:39] <nFFF> t4nkd
[12:19:10] <JBP641> nFFF: now I'm having trouble getting the text out of that div :S
[12:19:17] <nFFF> try .not()
[12:19:19] <nFFF> ?not
[12:19:19] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:19:44] <sam113101> nFFF: here is my code http://pastebin.com/hxMynCqB
[12:19:49] <sam113101> this should work, right?
[12:19:50] <nFFF> JBP641 what does data return?
[12:19:52] <t4nkd> nFFF: touche sir -- it was the element ID and not the class ;x
[12:20:01] <JBP641> the full div
[12:20:17] <JBP641> then 	      var sid = $( data ).find( '#sid' ).text(); alerts nothing
[12:20:49] <nFFF> log (data) and paste it
[12:20:52] <nFFF> the exact log
[12:21:06] <JBP641> ok
[12:21:36] <t4nkd> nFFF: just as a point of practice, is .not() preferred over :not() ?
[12:22:01] <nFFF> sam113101, put a space between them
[12:22:05] <nFFF> your selector is wrong
[12:22:37] <JBP641> nFFF: <div id="sid">CA15df2ae00d754f8aabba793111444f64</div>
[12:23:19] <nFFF> t4nkd, Id think :not() is preferred
[12:23:24] <nFFF> as its a native CSS selector
[12:23:30] <sam113101> thank you
[12:23:36] <t4nkd> Cool, I think I prefer it at any rate -- ty :)
[12:23:43] <nFFF> JBP641, ...
[12:23:44] <nFFF> ok
[12:23:59] <nFFF> so why not just $(data).text()
[12:24:39] <JBP641> and just ditch the div
[12:24:43] <nFFF> ?find
[12:24:43] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:25:00] <nFFF> find doesn't include the curren elemen
[12:25:09] <nFFF> it's the descendants
[12:25:27] <nFFF> JBP641
[12:25:42] <nFFF> just do this: $('#results').html().replaceWith($(data).text());
[12:26:58] <jscheel> are there any performance boosts to using a scoped selector e.g. $('.selector', scope), or is it just a convenience factor?
[12:27:49] <nFFF> Dont qoute me on this
[12:28:00] <nFFF> but I hink $(scope).find() is faster
[12:28:14] <titii> Hello, what mean the Wipe effect for a page transaction? Thanks
[12:28:20] * Eviltwin quotes nFFF on that
[12:28:26] <JBP641> nFFF: well actually getting rid of that all together because I just needed to get the sid variable to load into my load status function…now have to figure out why that's not refreshing every 2 seconds like I'm telling it to
[12:29:04] <nFFF> Eviltwin :D whats faster ?
[12:29:04] <Hombretao> would anyone please take a look at this code and provide some help with it? http://jsfiddle.net/XwNEe/ thanks in advance
[12:29:15] <nFFF> Or am I think $('.parent .child')
[12:29:15] <Eviltwin> nFFF: What vs what?
[12:29:33] <nFFF> $('.selector', scope) vs $(scope).find('.selector')
[12:29:50] <Eviltwin> First one runs the second one
[12:29:58] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this page http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html if you click "1" FancyBox opens the wrong image (2)..
[12:30:02] <nFFF> Ok so there the same
[12:30:09] <Eviltwin> So it's a function call more expensive
[12:30:21] <Eviltwin> Plus some basic checking
[12:30:39] <Eviltwin> So the latter is faster but not my anything generally noticeable
[12:30:40] <nFFF> $('.parent').find('.child') is faster than  $('.parent .child') right?
[12:30:46] <LekeFly> This is what im doing to get the image link function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){ $('.fancybox-thumb').trigger('click'); }
[12:30:59] <jscheel> nFFF: but pushing a dom el to a scope would mean sizzle knows where to start is selecting, right?
[12:31:14] <nFFF> LekeFly nice function name :<<
[12:31:33] <someprimetime> @Hombretao what the heck are you trying to do?
[12:31:37] <LekeFly> nFFF: :P its in the plugin
[12:32:10] <Hombretao> someprimetime: im trying to validate form input :<
[12:32:11] <nFFF> its a reduntant function :|
[12:33:03] <LekeFly> nFFF: ?
[12:33:29] <Hombretao> someprimetime: i certainly have no idea how that works, thats why i am asking for help, alho i know so far what it does in the end, and what i need it to do :(
[12:33:45] <someprimetime> i'd put each validation option into an object and then loop through each of them every time the submit button is clicked
[12:33:50] <nFFF> you pass an argument to the function which you don't even use, that only triggers an event
[12:33:59] <someprimetime> if you don't have any idea how it works, how can you expect to maintain it?
[12:34:08] <nFFF> wherever you call that function just replace it with your trigger
[12:34:10] <someprimetime> that code is pretty sloppy, it'd just start over
[12:34:14] <someprimetime> i'd*
[12:34:22] <Hombretao> someprimetime: there is a loop that does just that already
[12:34:35] <LekeFly> nFFF: I have no idea what you mean.. but im sure the plugin creator knew what he was doing :p
[12:34:51] <someprimetime> i see that.
[12:35:11] <LekeFly> nFFF: checkout http://sandquist.no/dev/etalage/instructions.html and "Advanced: Callback functions"
[12:35:26] <Hombretao> someprimetime: the thing is i have too many radius-type checkboxes in the form
[12:35:27] <someprimetime> p.s. you're using mootools on jsfiddle
[12:35:35] <someprimetime> radio buttons?
[12:35:46] <someprimetime> what do you mean you have too many?
[12:35:58] <Hombretao> i dont know how to acces them from inside the loop
[12:36:17] <Hombretao> i have written some of them to see if i can ultimalty get them to validate
[12:36:20] <Hombretao> and they do
[12:36:27] <someprimetime> wrap them around a div, target the parent container when you use your each() loop
[12:36:47] <Hombretao> but i know there has to be a way to reference all of them
[12:36:50] <Hombretao> hum...
[12:36:53] <Hombretao> ok
[12:37:28] <Hombretao> well, i can see there is an array already
[12:38:01] <TheJohlin> Hey guys! How can I make a self-executing function available to other functions? http://jsfiddle.net/jR75P/
[12:38:17] <someprimetime> Hombretao: did you write this?
[12:38:27] <Hombretao> no, i didnt
[12:38:32] <Hombretao> got it from some tutorial
[12:38:34] <someprimetime> have you used javascript before?
[12:38:37] <Hombretao> on sliding jquery form
[12:38:42] <Hombretao> very little
[12:38:45] <someprimetime> you aren't calling this function from anywhere
[12:38:49] <someprimetime> you just cleared it
[12:38:51] <someprimetime> declared*
[12:38:56] <nFFF> TheJohlin, that should be fine
[12:39:05] <Hombretao> yes, thats becase it is called inside another function
[12:39:12] <someprimetime> where?
[12:39:25] <Hombretao> herees the whole thing http://jsfiddle.net/PtNAn/
[12:39:30] <Hombretao> it aint pretty, sorry :(
[12:40:09] <TheJohlin> @nFFF: Yes, it works, but I have a function call at the bottom and I would like to just wrap it inside (function(){})();
[12:40:55] <Hombretao> i can check each radio-input like this:    document.formElem.educacion[0].checked == false
[12:40:57] <Hombretao> :<
[12:41:09] <TheJohlin> But when I wrap it inside of the brackets it hides it from the global namespace
[12:41:58] <supsup> why pop so slow in chrome? http://jsperf.com/pop-vs-length-removal  or is my test bad (most probable).
[12:42:35] <JBP641> ahhhh caching!
[12:42:43] <felixqc> ARG
[12:42:51] <felixqc> damn click firing twice
[12:43:06] <JBP641> How do I keep #status from caching?  http://pastebin.com/GBfqic67
[12:43:16] <nFFF> TheJohlin, you should be able to call it from with that function
[12:43:44] <TheJohlin> this is what I would like: http://jsfiddle.net/jR75P/1/
[12:43:55] <TheJohlin> But then it doesn't work
[12:44:09] <nFFF> Im lost
[12:44:29] <nFFF> You can call your global function from within another function
[12:44:35] <nFFF> you shouldn't have scoping issues
[12:45:39] <TheJohlin> The log says it's not defined
[12:46:43] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/jR75P/2/
[12:46:50] <nFFF> look at this example
[12:47:47] <acidjazz> if functions w/in a function in js are not class/methods
[12:47:49] <acidjazz> whats hte proper terminology for them
[12:48:30] <TheJohlin> Okay, and how can I make it execute the function when it's defined?
[12:48:46] <nFFF> I have no idea what you mean
[12:48:52] <TheJohlin> I want it to run once, and then every time an event fired
[12:49:01] <nFFF> If you can't extropolate from my code
[12:49:04] <nFFF> I cant help you
[12:49:15] <nFFF> acidjazz, child methods? child functions?
[12:53:03] <anth0ny> Is there a way to bind a a listener to an element's attribute?  Basically, I want to run a function when a checkbox is checked/unchecked.  This box could either be checked/unchecked by a person OR by another function.  I'd like to bind an event to the $('input').attr('checked') value
[12:53:56] <nFFF> andornaut
[12:53:59] <nFFF> anth0ny
[12:54:01] <nFFF> just bind click
[12:54:02] <TheJohlin> anth0ny: What about .change() ?
[12:54:26] <anth0ny> nFFF: I don't think click is right, since I said that the checkbox could be unchecked by a function
[12:54:46] <nFFF> Ah ok
[12:55:07] <anth0ny> TheJohlin: looking into .change() now.
[12:55:24] <nFFF> change is what yu need
[12:56:23] <Jon47> .on('change' preferably..
[12:56:40] <nFFF> why?
[12:56:50] <kamoricks> Is there a way to cancel a pending ajax request? I only want to have one of a particular request at a time.
[12:57:43] <nFFF> kamoricks you can make them synchronous
[12:57:52] <sam113101> how do I get the id of a new created tab?
[12:58:08] <anth0ny> .change doesn't seem to be catching when I change a state by $(input).removeAttr('checked');
[12:58:26] <kamoricks> nFFF: The request can take up to a minute. I don't want to lock up the browser for that long.
[12:58:26] <nFFF> Yes it only works to values
[12:58:30] <nFFF> not attributes
[12:58:35] <nFFF> ?change
[12:58:35] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[13:00:04] <anth0ny> nFFF: well, isn't the state of a checkbox an attribute?  anything to catch it if the attribute changes?
[13:01:21] <nFFF> use disabled and enabled
[13:03:05] <Deafgoose> Hi, Im trying to set the value of an element with values from all <input> inside a <div> using $("#bannerCodes").val($("#individualBanners input").val()); however it only gets the first inputs value, how do I catch all?
[13:04:11] <message144> Can `$.ajaxSetup({beforeSend})` be set multiple times?
[13:05:03] <ccohn> Deafgoose: http://api.jquery.com/each/ on your form set.
[13:07:14] <Deafgoose> hmm gotcha
[13:07:17] <kamoricks> Okay. Another question. I want to turn http://jsfiddle.net/veSjV/ into JQuery, particularly the document.createElement() calls into .append(). However, I don't see a way to do $("#sensor_results>tbody").append() for an incomplete element. Is there a way to do this?
[13:07:53] <Deafgoose> thing is, after each loop, the end result is only the last items value
[13:08:36] <ccohn> Use concatenation
[13:09:04] <Deafgoose> ahh cool
[13:10:47] <ccohn> this might not be valid, but should be close function() { var bcodes; $(#individualBanners input").each( function() { bcodes .= $(this).val(); }; $("#bannerCodes").val(bcodes);
[13:11:01] <Nuno147> Shoud $.post call the anonymos callback even when an error return ?
[13:11:52] <nFFF> ccohn, what does .= do?
[13:11:52] <Deafgoose> awesome
[13:12:01] <nFFF> Never used it before
[13:12:02] <Deafgoose> i thought it would be +=
[13:12:02] <ccohn> er... +=
[13:12:06] <Deafgoose> ahh
[13:12:10] <Deafgoose> .= (php) :-)
[13:12:12] <ccohn> switching between PHP and JS all day
[13:12:13] <nFFF> :>>
[13:12:17] <Deafgoose> hehe
[13:12:42] <CodeZombie> shouldn't I be able to access event.pageX, and event.pageY in draggables drag event?
[13:12:46] <CodeZombie> the result is null
[13:14:06] <Deafgoose> strange
[13:14:17] <Deafgoose> Im getting a "undefined" string in front of all values
[13:14:20] <Nuno147> Shouldn't $.post return to the callback function even when an error ? currently I have a simple $.post call and when the web-server return an error , the callback never called..
[13:14:41] <paniwani> i'm struggling to customize the error msg of jquery validation, any help? https://gist.github.com/1903782

I'm trying to use the Underscore Library with Backbone but I can't figure out where I'm going wrong.... http://jsfiddle.net/QCjj4/28/ is it working with me pulling the data directly from the models and piecing together html.... http://jsfiddle.net/QCjj4/29/ is me trying to use underscore templates
[13:25:56] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this page http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html if you click "1" FancyBox opens the wrong image (2)..
[13:26:09] <LekeFly> This is what im doing to get the image link function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){ $('.fancybox-thumb').trigger('click'); }
[13:44:06] <t4nkd> Hey jquery -- how can I set an element as being :active (specifically an anchor)
[13:44:24] <CodeZombie> is there any reason event.pageX/Y doesn't work with jquery ui draggable drag event? http://jsfiddle.net/CMnPW/1/
[13:44:43] <CodeZombie> looks like with 1.7.1 it's undefined, and in 1.5.2 it works
[13:46:13] <chilversc> t4nkd: give it focus?
[13:46:22] <Uncle_Mother> Ack. I've been stupid and have an ASP page with lots of jQuery ajax POSTing to pages to save and get data. One user used the back button today and blew the whole damned thing up.
[13:46:29] <Uncle_Mother> How is this sort of thing normally handled?
[13:47:00] <t4nkd> Hrm, it's no big deal, I'll just add a class to the pseudo-selector styles
[13:47:02] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: depends, what do you want to happen when the user pushes the back button?
[13:47:22] <Uncle_Mother> Honestly I'd prefer they don't use it at all, but disabling it has been problematic and it feels like a bad solution
[13:47:26] <Uncle_Mother> and I know they'll push it instinctively
[13:47:34] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: yeah, disabling it is normally bad
[13:47:49] <Uncle_Mother> i'm using some jqdialogs to save things and they are POST'ing to an asp page
[13:47:51] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: the question is, should they go back to a previous state for the same page, or back to the previous page?
[13:48:06] <Uncle_Mother> in this case there is no previous state/page in the sytsem
[13:48:11] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: and on returning to this page, should the system restore the state of the page to what it was?
[13:48:15] <Uncle_Mother> they're grading papers and they are "saving" progressively
[13:48:18] <Uncle_Mother> actually
[13:48:20] <Uncle_Mother> yeah
[13:48:23] <Dave_Stein> has anyone ever had an issue when trying to post up a JSON string using AJAX, when having ?? in the string?
[13:48:31] <Uncle_Mother> if they press "save" for example - it saves and shows a dialog
[13:48:46] <Uncle_Mother> if they hit back, which doens't make sense based on how we use it, i suppose it should refresh with the post-saved state
[13:48:49] <Uncle_Mother> if that makes esnse
[13:48:59] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: so back sounds like it goes back to the list of papers (or where ever they came from) and returning to a half graded paper shows it in its state before they navigated away
[13:49:10] <Uncle_Mother> kind of
[13:49:13] <Dave_Stein> i can save all this data and it works fine but if i make it specificaly ?? it turns it into jQuery2340928304982
[13:49:16] <Dave_Stein> or some other random number
[13:49:36] <Uncle_Mother> they'd be grading a paper and they'd save it so they coudl go back somewhere else in the system potentially
[13:49:39] <Uncle_Mother> and return to work on it later
[13:49:50] <Uncle_Mother> so they could conceivably press back expecting to get to the main menu
[13:49:56] <Uncle_Mother> but they should press the "main menu" lilnk instead
[13:50:06] <CodeZombie> gah, why did they take this out... blah
[13:50:22] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: I'd probably also hook in to the onunload event for the document and show a warning if they havn't saved (with periodic automatic saves)
[13:50:30] <Dave_Stein> nm: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8417
[13:50:36] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: only need to show the warning if the dirty flag is set (ie unsaved)
[13:50:39] <Uncle_Mother> that's a super idea. is there a link or reference to code like this
[13:50:39] <Uncle_Mother> ah
[13:50:41] <Uncle_Mother> i see
[13:50:47] <Uncle_Mother> actually that will make us all happy
[13:50:51] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: hmm, that's really weird
[13:50:59] <CodeZombie> johnkpaul: yeah, it is
[13:51:09] <Uncle_Mother> because the side effect of "back" shows the dialog and since the variables aren't set it "saves" blank information
[13:51:12] <CodeZombie> I really need that too, and rolling back to a previous version breaks a bunch of stuff for me
[13:51:14] <Uncle_Mother> i know i need ot validate - a lot
[13:51:27] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: for the dirty flag, I hook in to the onchange event for all the inputs, onchange dirty = true, when saving dirty = false
[13:51:49] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: actually, its slightly more complex than that if you ajax save, as you have to handle, begin save, make edit, end save
[13:52:06] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: there is another way
[13:52:07] <johnkpaul> well, actually
[13:52:10] <johnkpaul> is there a originalEvent
[13:52:23] <CodeZombie> yes
[13:52:25] <Uncle_Mother> i think i undersatnd
[13:52:28] <Uncle_Mother> right now when thye hit save
[13:52:31] <Uncle_Mother> it grabs the values from the form fields
[13:52:36] <johnkpaul> ah yes
[13:52:37] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie:
[13:52:37] <Uncle_Mother> and does a post to an asp page with those values
[13:52:40] <johnkpaul> it's in the original event
[13:52:41] <Uncle_Mother> i return back a code or a message
[13:52:48] <johnkpaul> because the drag event masks it
[13:52:50] <Uncle_Mother> and once the ajax call is copmlete it pops a dialog to notify the user
[13:52:58] <Uncle_Mother> i'm sure pressing back just makes it miserable
[13:53:05] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: I'd make showing the initial form a get request, same as the list of papers they come from, and all the posts ajax, so the back button should always return to the list of papers
[13:53:57] <Uncle_Mother> they might navigate back to their menu screen as well, or expect that. after that they press a button to view the list of papers (their menu, or home screen, shows them stats and doesn't present them with documents)
[13:54:10] <Uncle_Mother> getting *to* the edit page is a link with url/querystring
[13:54:10] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: http://jsfiddle.net/CMnPW/1/#update
[13:54:12] <Uncle_Mother> which i suppose is a get
[13:54:18] <CodeZombie> johnkpaul: okay, that didn't seem to work like I thought... I'm getting a drifting effect when the parent is scaled, and the element is dragged in firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/CMnPW/2/
[13:54:30] <Uncle_Mother> but i think the ajax posts in the eit screen make it so the back button does weird things
[13:54:47] <CodeZombie> I thought e.pageX, and e.pageY would allow me to normalize it... this only happens in IE
[13:54:50] <CodeZombie> err Firefox
[13:55:09] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: did you try originalEvent?
[13:55:21] <CodeZombie> johnkpaul: yeah I did, the drifting still occurs
[13:55:49] <CodeZombie> you get more drifting the farther you drag from the origin position
[13:56:20] <johnkpaul> oh
[13:56:22] <johnkpaul> hmm
[13:56:25] <Uncle_Mother> so if i use a GET (querystring) request to get ot the edit page
[13:56:27] <johnkpaul> I see what you mean, but I don't have a solution
[13:56:32] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: shouldn't do, if its ajax without altering the url (eg hashtag stuff), since the previous navigated page would still be the list they came from
[13:56:41] <Uncle_Mother> hm
[13:56:44] <Uncle_Mother> hang on
[13:56:48] <Uncle_Mother> do you have a pastebin on this channel?
[13:57:01] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this page http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html if you click "1" FancyBox opens the wrong image (2)..
[13:57:05] <LekeFly> This is what im doing to get the image link function etalage_click_callback(image_anchor){ $('.fancybox-thumb').trigger('click'); }
[13:57:06] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: maybe you havn't prevented the browser from actually submitting the form normally, so the browser is doing a normal post?
[13:57:15] <Uncle_Mother> hm
[13:57:17] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: yeah, see the topic, jsbin
[13:57:17] <Uncle_Mother> that's an idea too
[13:57:19] <Uncle_Mother> i juts ran into that
[13:57:39] <Uncle_Mother> i've been putting a form on the page and then catching the submit and lookign at the button that called it
[13:57:45] <Uncle_Mother> should I not have the form if i never post it?
[13:57:47] <Uncle_Mother> or rather
[13:57:51] <CodeZombie> johnkpaul: I actually got it, than ks!
[13:57:53] <Uncle_Mother> i grab the post and use it to execute ajax
[13:58:05] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: what was your fix?
[13:58:16] <CodeZombie> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/CMnPW/3/
[13:58:34] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: also, perhaps look in to some token that changes on posting (in a hidden field), if a post happens with an incorrect token you know its out of date
[13:58:35] <CodeZombie> it pushes the cursor to the top left edge, but still works
[13:58:42] <Uncle_Mother> hm
[13:58:44] <johnkpaul> CodeZombie: ah I see, great
[13:58:51] <Uncle_Mother> if i catch the onsubmit and then call my own code and return false
[13:58:53] <Uncle_Mother> did the form post?
[13:58:59] <Uncle_Mother> and what does it do to the back button?
[13:59:21] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: shouldn't post, and back should return to the list
[13:59:27] <Uncle_Mother> hm
[13:59:51] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: I'd fire up chrome, open the developer tools, and keep an eye on the network tab to see if the request is really ajax
[13:59:57] <Uncle_Mother> right
[14:00:00] <Uncle_Mother> hang on a sec
[14:01:32] <Uncle_Mother> it's not the offiical pastebin but http://pastebin.com/cHkJScyV
[14:01:56] <Uncle_Mother> i'm sure it's got issues-  i learned jquery on my own and it seems like i'm missing some fundamentals
[14:02:21] <Uncle_Mother> line 204 is where i grab the form submit
[14:02:31] <Uncle_Mother> 219 is where i post a save
[14:02:49] <Uncle_Mother> 306 is the actual ajax request
[14:02:57] <Zzaichik> is there any good literature out there for jQuery?  I would think just a strong foundation in javascript would be the way to go.
[14:03:27] <bababa> with jquery you can attach mouse events by class
[14:03:47] <bababa> but if you add a node after it doesn't work
[14:04:03] <bababa> is there a fix for this?
[14:04:13] <chilversc> Uncle_Mother: you probably want to look at event.preventDefault() there, and returning false from your submit handler to perevent the browser submit
[14:04:47] <DerekPioneer> i'm using $('img').load() multiple times for the same reason throughout a script (users can edit sepia, black and white, each time it has to call load()) but it seems like all these events are sort of getting tangled up
[14:05:21] <DerekPioneer> like when the sepia function calls .load() the black and white function is seeing the $('img').load() as well
[14:06:13] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this page http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html if you click "1" FancyBox opens the wrong image (2)..  10$ to whoever figures it out :p
[14:09:13] <dilvie> lol - http://enterprise-js.com/27

[14:12:05] <gehsekky> lol
[14:13:53] <FJ1> @dilvie GREAT!! hahahaha
[14:15:02] <dilvie> kamoricks: take a closer look at that example. ;)
[14:15:16] <kamoricks> dilvie: Oh. OKay, nevermind, I'm not doing *that*. :)
[14:20:54] <dilvie> kamoricks: I actually do use code like that *all the time* -- but I'm not trying to cache the selection when I do. I'm trying to decouple the selectors from the procedures for better separation of concerns... and I'll usually cache the result at the top of whatever function I'm invoking. var $foo = $(view.selectors.foo); $foo.addClass(bar).show();
[14:25:18] <Nomikos> Is there a way to figure out if there are no input elements focused? I want to use some characters as kb shortcuts, but not when people actually want to input them
[14:28:35] <auzigog> I need to make a form that 1) sends an ajax post to a URL 2) on success, does an HTML replace on the page. 3) on error, re-does the entire post to the URL and redirects to the URL. here's what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/nLWyq/
[14:28:57] <black_warlock> hi peeps
[14:29:19] <black_warlock> how can i find the immediatelly next ul ?
[14:29:27] <kamoricks> Niphyr: $("input:focus") will give you all focused elements. Check if there are zero.
[14:29:34] <DerekPioneer> how do i get loadUGCMain() to stop firing when sepia() is called. http://jsfiddle.net/wHT5a/
[14:29:54] <Nomikos> kamoricks: cheers
[14:31:52] <black_warlock> .closest() goes up ? and .find () down ?
[14:32:08] <Nomikos> black_warlock: yes
[14:32:54] <black_warlock> .find() search inside the tag ?
[14:33:13] <black_warlock> or its .next89 ?
[14:33:18] <black_warlock> .next()
[14:33:21] <Nomikos> It searches through the descendents, so "in"
[14:33:41] <Nomikos> next() deals with the sibling tags
[14:33:54] <Es0teric> i am trying to hover over an element change it, then revert it back to its original state… the problem with my fiddle is that when you continuously hover over the element to trigger it, it stops changing the element after a while, so its not consistent http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/6/

[14:53:45] <DerekPioneer> when you click sepia $('#pre img').load() is callled
[14:53:55] <DerekPioneer> i only want that load() to work the first time it's called.
[14:54:13] <chilversc> DerekPioneer: then don't call it twice?
[14:54:33] <chilversc> DerekPioneer: or, in the event handler, detach the handler?
[14:54:47] <chilversc> depening on what you mean by only want load to work the first time
[14:54:53] <gehsekky> http://api.jquery.com/one/  ?

[15:13:46] <imsky> then i guess you already know your code works
[15:13:52] <imsky> so what's your question, grasshopper?
[15:14:08] <jonathancutrell> It does work on jsfiddle for some reason.
[15:14:26] <jonathancutrell> The event isn't even firing in my code (locally or on the server).
[15:14:36] <imsky> are you on a mac?
[15:14:39] <jonathancutrell> yup
[15:14:50] <imsky> yeah there's your problem

[15:15:17] <thang> wat
[15:15:18] <jonathancutrell> done.
[15:17:52] <Phoenixz> I have <span id='a'>Title<span id='b'>X</span></span>   I need that when #a is clicked, that action "show A" is executed. I need that when #b is clicked that action "close A" is executed. When A is closed, it can no longer be shown.. Problem is that with the click, first #a receives the event, then #b... How can I fix this so that #b first receives the event?

[15:22:04] <Es0teric> i am trying to hover over an element change it, then revert it back to its original state… the problem with my fiddle is that when you continuously hover over the element to trigger it, it stops changing the element after a while, so its not consistent http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/6/
[15:23:08] <imsky> Es0teric: use css
[15:23:24] <Es0teric> imsky, how do i do that with css?

[15:25:18] <imsky> do you belieb me?
[15:26:28] <Es0teric> -_-
[15:27:01] <imsky> ok let me give you a hint
[15:27:05] <imsky> css AND html
[15:27:36] <Es0teric> imsky, i want to do something SPECIFIC… like HOVER one element, change the element, then on HOVER OUT of the parent element revert it back
[15:28:06] <imsky> for what you have, you don't need to change element
[15:28:09] <imsky> just show/hide the edit link
[15:29:21] <Es0teric> imsky, you cant do what i want to do in ONLY css though
[15:29:30] <imsky> pretty sure i can
[15:30:11] <Es0teric> imsky, so you can hover .assignmt_img, have it change the element then on HOVER OUT of the PARENT of .assignmt_img, revert the element back?
[15:30:20] <Guddu> Dear all...I want to dynamically add <tr> elements and I was using the code as in http://pastebin.com/nc99mDXA to do this...This gets fired from select event handler of autocomplete.....But this serves me only to change the html ...I want to add multiple <tr> rows ...What is the best way to accomplish this?

[16:14:56] <Mika3> that' worked black_warlock  thanks
[16:15:02] <Mika3> i'll just combine my date nand time box
[16:15:08] <Mika3> but i have to store the in the db seperately
[16:15:22] <Mika3> i hope there is an option to just pull out the time part sperate from the date part
[16:15:25] <Mika3> i'll read the documenation

[16:17:29] <TheUnknownFacto> Hi, I was looking at the (range) slider, was wondering- is there any way to make the scale be exponential?
[16:18:41] <TheUnknownFacto> basically what I'm looking to dois have a range slider that allows you to choose stories between [x] and [y] old, id like the user to be able to choose recent times with fairly high precision, while also being able to select things from 5 years ago without needing an 80000 pixel wide slider
[16:18:52] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Az53C/22/
[16:20:06] <black_warlock> it is easy
[16:20:28] <black_warlock> just put a function that chage your ranges
[16:20:50] <black_warlock> you can do it with a form field and time field
[16:20:56] <black_warlock> we were just working around it
[16:21:19] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Az53C/22/
[16:21:21] <black_warlock> ^^
[16:21:53] <TheUnknownFacto> I dont really need a time field- stories are only stored by date. but yeah a from/to date field would probably be a better solution than a range slider
[16:22:33] <TheUnknownFacto> there's no easy way to navigate the years though, or as I missing something?
[16:22:34] <black_warlock> or find any other way to set range
[16:23:37] <TheUnknownFacto> frankly Ive not actually used jquery before, mostly been able to do whatever i've wanted with html5, css3, and my own rather terrible javascript skills
[16:24:30] <black_warlock> hum
[16:25:05] <black_warlock> cant image what are you trying to do
[16:25:10] <TheUnknownFacto> been wanting to get into it for a while- since really... it's kind of awesome. Just never really ended up actually getting my hands dirty
[16:25:46] <TheUnknownFacto> basically I aggregate stories from a website, this website has stories ranging back about 12 years back
[16:26:04] <TheUnknownFacto> I want to be able to choose a date range within which I want to view stories
[16:26:14] <black_warlock> hem
[16:26:16] <TheUnknownFacto> so, perhaps stories in the past week
[16:26:24] <TheUnknownFacto> perhaps stories 5 years ago
[16:26:34] <Mika3> Hot damn Black!
[16:26:36] <black_warlock> and range slider doesnt work ?
[16:26:47] <Mika3> this datetimepicker has an option just for TIMEPICKER    i've found just what I need
[16:26:51] <Mika3> thanks man!!!!!
[16:27:02] <black_warlock> np
[16:27:13] <TheUnknownFacto> range slider would work if I added some exponential scaling yeah
[16:27:31] <Mika3> http://jsfiddle.net/Az53C/23/
[16:27:55] <black_warlock> ;)
[16:28:15] <black_warlock> its just math man
[16:28:21] <TheUnknownFacto> yep
[16:28:49] <black_warlock> get your math function and apply it
[16:28:52] <TheUnknownFacto> are you currently working on that time/date control?
[16:29:20] <Mika3> I love jquery!
[16:29:29] <black_warlock> date time has ranges
[16:30:03] <odwalla> it's a jQuery UI control
[16:30:44] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Az53C/25/
[16:31:57] <TheUnknownFacto> that looks somewhat broken in my browser o_o
[16:32:53] <TheUnknownFacto> but yeah ill probably go with something like that
[16:33:05] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Az53C/27/
[16:33:21] <black_warlock> but range slider its better using dates
[16:33:32] <black_warlock> and its more dinamical and funny
[16:35:26] <black_warlock> got an idea
[16:35:41] <TheUnknownFacto> o_o
[16:35:51] <black_warlock> use the range bar to move trough years , when user release the margin
[16:36:05] <black_warlock> u can pop date selector
[16:36:28] <black_warlock> to select month and day and time if you want
[16:37:03] <TheUnknownFacto> ill probably go with something like that, though right now its 1:30 am, calling it a day :p
[16:37:19] <black_warlock> gnite
[16:37:28] <TheUnknownFacto> night, and thanks :)
[16:43:07] <Guddu> black_warlock, Could u guide me a little?

[17:01:15] <Guest23550> Hey
[17:01:30] <Guest23550> I was wondering if anyone in here has ever taken part in the prison pen pals program?
[17:03:07] <ajpiano> Guest23550: ???
[17:04:04] <Shazer[2]> ajpiano, hey. :)
[17:04:08] <ajpiano> hi Shazer[2]
[17:04:13] <Shazer[2]> What's up?
[17:04:29] <ajpiano> have a cold, going to take a shower,
[17:04:59] <Shazer[2]> Oh yeah.
[17:05:07] <Shazer[2]> HOW THE HELL IS YOUR FACEBOOK NAME ALL LOWER CASE?
[17:05:24] <ajpiano> it's been that way  since 2004
[17:05:41] <ajpiano> do they not let you do that now
[17:05:43] <Shazer[2]> You've had FB since '04?
[17:06:15] <ajpiano> 04 or early 05, whenever it got to my college
[17:06:16] <Guest23550> ajpiano: You know there are programs to become a pen pal for prisoners
[17:06:28] <Guest23550> But they seem to prefer female participants..
[17:06:32] <Shazer[2]> ajpiano: You can't do it now. :P
[17:06:33] <Guest23550> So I am considering making an alter ego.
[17:06:38] <Shazer[2]> It automatically changes to caps on each name.
[17:06:40] <ajpiano> Guest23550: i'm unsure of why you'd come into a large, specific subject irc channel to discuss that
[17:06:48] <Guest23550> ajpiano: ?
[17:07:01] <Guest23550> I am sure the people in here are from a diverse interest group..
[17:07:03] <ajpiano> ?offtopic becoming a prison pen pal
[17:07:04] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of becoming a prison pen pal is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[17:07:07] <Guest23550> One of them may have an insight into this.
[17:07:28] <Shazer[2]> ajpiano: Do you feel privileged to have been one of the first people to use FB?
[17:07:34] <ajpiano> nope
[17:07:34] <Shazer[2]> By first I mean within the first 10,000 probably.
[17:07:43] <Shazer[2]> So you've seen a lot of change I guess.
[17:07:47] <ajpiano> i'm not first 10k
[17:08:07] <Shazer[2]> What would you say you are?
[17:08:08] <ajpiano> i have a bunch of ppl in my friends who are in the same yr as harvard as zuck, they are like under the first 500 lo
[17:08:09] <ajpiano> lol
[17:08:15] <ajpiano> i donno, i used to know off hand.
[17:08:22] <Guest23550> ajpiano: The only other thing really is how much time I would need to devote to it
[17:08:30] <ajpiano> anyway
[17:08:35] <ajpiano> ?offtopic my use of facebook
[17:08:36] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of my use of facebook is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[17:08:41] <Guest23550> However, apparently many of these things result in mmeetings when the prisoner is released
[17:08:44] <Guest23550> If they are released.
[17:08:53] * tw2113 needs beer
[17:09:03] <Guest23550> And sometimes end up as a coupling
[17:09:10] <Guest23550> I don't really want that
[17:09:15] <ajpiano> Guest23550: there's clearly gotta be a better venue for you to research that than here, please stop like vaguely trolling us or whatever you're doing

Now my problem is that when i select the same item from the list then instead of a new row getting added, it should just update the quantity of the existing row by 1..
[17:36:30] <Guddu> ..Could someone please guide? My select event handler is posted at http://pastebin.com/sDjgfcE2

[18:07:43] <adfasdfj> What is the syntax to incrementally add/subtract values to CSS with jQuery??
[18:08:28] <adfasdfj> .css('width', +'10em'); isn't working :(
[18:09:03] <adfasdfj> Ah nm
[18:09:40] <adfasdfj> Well... nnm...
[18:09:45] <adfasdfj> .css('width', '+=10em'); doesn't work either.
[18:10:45] <stalecache> adfasdfj, .css('width','
[18:10:49] <Shazer[2]> Can anyone answer me?
[18:11:11] <adfasdfj> stalecache?
[18:11:33] <stalecache> ... $(this).css('width', ($(this).innerWidth() + 10) + "px"); ... something like that
[18:12:51] <aqeel> .css('width', +'10em');..............in ''......not incrment but becomes property
[18:13:15] <adfasdfj> What do you mean aqeel?
[18:13:42] <aqeel> .css('width', increment+'px em %')
[18:14:07] <Shazer[2]> so
[18:14:08] <stalecache> aqeel, no idea what that means
[18:14:15] <Shazer[2]> .css('width', 10+'em')
[18:14:21] <aqeel> no...
[18:14:46] <aqeel> create an increment variable.....pass it with value as +'em'
[18:17:50] <aqeel> typing pop-up thing..............explain?

[21:08:16] <jtoy> what causes .ajax to call the error function?   my server returns a 200 but error still gets called
[21:21:57] <here4thegear> So, when I go to http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=4008+Hermans+Sons+Rd,+Austin,+TX+76574&sensor=false in browser all is fine but when I use $.get it just returns a response code of 200 with no data
[21:22:04] <witchelles> hello today
[21:22:40] <tocka> hey
[21:22:43] <here4thegear> nevermind... grrr.. me being silly
[21:23:10] <palanivel> gud morning
[21:23:46] <tocka> gud gud:]
[21:23:56] <palanivel> any 1 help me............how to upload multiple file in single time  using jquery....
[21:24:36] <Guddu> Is there a way in JQuery to find out count of all the elements which have a particular value for id .... For example
[21:24:37] <Guddu> <td id="reg_item_qty" style="width: 77px; "><input type="text" name="quantity" value="1" size="20" id="quantity_2"><input type="hidden" name="id" value="2"></td>
[21:25:03] <Guddu> I want to kno all the input of type="hidden" that have value="2"
[21:25:34] <tocka> Guddu
[21:25:35] <tocka> http://gauravsohoni.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/jquery-count-elements-with-similar-ids/
[21:26:42] <Guddu> Thanks tocka
[21:27:19] <palanivel> how to upload multiple file in single time using jquery....
[21:27:21] <here4thegear> actually, yeah, still having an issue http://pastebin.com/E2m5uMXj here is my $.get() and firebug is giving me 200 ok but how do I actually access the data?
[21:31:58] <Guddu> tocka, There is a slight issue though. May be you could help me. Suppose i have this
[21:31:59] <Guddu> var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value='4']").length
[21:32:30] <Guddu> Now instead of hardcoding 4, i want the id of the autoselected element to checked for .....That value is in ui.item.value.id
[21:32:44] <Guddu> How could i use ui.item.value.id instead of that hardcoded 4 in the above statement?
[21:36:51] <witchelles> please help me
[21:37:00] <witchelles> with this: http://pastebin.com/7UeQXJwb
[21:38:05] <here4thegear> What is the issue?
[21:39:38] <here4thegear> witchelles: all I see is code... what is happening and what do you wish to happen that is not happening
[21:40:08] <Guddu> here4thegear, The problem is how to plug in a variable in a statement....The statement is var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value='4']").length .... Now instead of hardcoding 4, i want the id of the autoselected element to checked for .....That value is in ui.item.value.id
[21:42:21] <here4thegear> Guddu: var intVal = 4; var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value='" + intVal + "']").length
[21:42:38] <Guddu> Thanks here4thegear Pluggin it in now
[21:44:12] <witchelles> The checkbox being disable already works
[21:44:15] <here4thegear> Guddu: You're welcome. Let me know if there's any issue there but, I'm sure that should work.
[21:44:26] <witchelles> what I wanted now is when the user unchecks the checkbox
[21:44:46] <adfasdfj> Hey guys, anyone ever combined Isotope (Masonry) and Sortable?
[21:44:48] <Guddu> here4thegear, It introduced some undesirable behavior....Apparently it is not working
[21:45:03] <here4thegear> Guddu: what's the undesirable behavior?
[21:45:07] <witchelles> it should update the permission of the user
[21:45:21] <here4thegear> witchelles: if the checkbox is disabled, how can they uncheck it?
[21:45:37] <Guddu> here4thegear, My autoselect is configured to clear out as soon as i select something from the list..it does not work now....
[21:45:47] <Guddu> I will see if there is any exception in Javascript console
[21:46:56] <witchelles> And also I wanted to initialize the checkboxes to what they should be. The rules are.  When a user has read permission (add & approve should be disabled). When a user has add/approve (only read should should be disabled).  On my jQuery script it already works but if it's reload triggered it doesn't..
[21:48:19] <Guddu> here4thegear, My bad....a slight mistake..
[21:48:24] <Guddu> works just fine thanks :)
[21:48:46] <here4thegear> Guddu: No problem...
[21:48:56] <Guddu> here4thegear, What happenes if i put like this
[21:49:06] <Guddu> var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value=ui.item.value.id]").length
[21:51:38] <Guddu> here4thegear, Now i understand...in the end the selector has to be a string :)
[21:51:40] <here4thegear> var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value=" + ui.item.value.id + "]").length
[21:51:55] <witchelles> here4thegear?
[21:52:08] <here4thegear> witchelles: I'm thinking.
[21:52:13] <witchelles> thanks :)
[21:52:32] <Guddu> here4thegear, exactly...I was playing and i removed the ' as it was not needed...I understand this bettter. Thanks again and have a nice day
[21:53:54] <here4thegear> Guddu: you just have to make sure you're using the same datatypes... If ui.item.value.id is a string then [value=] has to be a string as well :-)
[21:54:25] <here4thegear> witchelles: so, if I understand you correctly, your code actually works, it just doesn't work when you use the reload trigger?
[21:54:25] <Guddu> here4thegear, Which in this case is a number....
[21:54:36] <Guddu> But i tried and it seems to be working both ways
[21:54:48] <Guddu> var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value=" + ui.item.value.id + "]").length
[21:54:49] <Guddu> and
[21:55:02] <Guddu> var rows=$(":input[type=hidden][value="' + ui.item.value.id + '"]").length
[21:56:05] <here4thegear> Guddu: oh yeah... Javascript maybe not as strict with datatypes like that? or maybe jquery.. Cool good to know both work.
[21:57:02] <here4thegear> witchelles: or are you saying that when you reload the data hasn't actually saved?
[21:58:36] <witchelles_> here4thegear am sorry I got disconnected
[22:01:02] <witchelles_> helllo
[22:11:28] <jjones> is anyone here?
[22:16:31] <witchelles> here4thegear art thou still here?
[22:19:47] <batousai> why is this variable undefined? var url = $('meta[http-equiv=refresh]').attr("content");
[22:25:48] <spiffie> try $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]')
[22:28:42] <witchelles> spiffie can I ask for some jQuery help
[22:29:33] <spiffie> sure, I'll answer if I can.
[22:31:35] <witchelles> Spiffie here's the problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9440132/not-selector-not-sure-if-im-doing-it-properly/9440382#9440382
[22:31:47] <witchelles> It hasn't been answered properly yet
[22:35:02] <witchelles> spiffie art thou still there?
[22:37:25] <spiffie> well one problem you're going to have right off the bat is that you don't have valid HTML
[22:37:39] <becom33> there is this thing in web sites like lightbox not for picture it views a another page . what does it called ?
[22:37:41] <spiffie> IDs have to be unique
[22:37:51] <spiffie> and you're repeating user_id as an ID on several of the inputs
[22:37:51] <witchelles> oh
[22:38:13] <spiffie> jQuery will typically try to help you out, but what it returns is always the first ID it finds
[22:38:25] <witchelles> that explains the double input
[22:38:29] <spiffie> so in your each loop, it's probably that user ID is always the user id of the first row
[22:38:35] <spiffie> probable
[22:38:56] <witchelles> so is there like a workaround
[22:39:04] <spiffie> becom33: maybe an iframe?
[22:39:16] <witchelles> forgive I'm just 16 and it's a school hw
[22:39:33] <spiffie> assign unique IDs to your inputs.
[22:39:46] <SirDerpsAlot> Anyone that can recommend a good jquery validation setup that's not a pain to set up?
[22:40:16] <batousai> spiffie, $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]') is still undefined
[22:41:12] <Micha_> what's abut adding something like this https://github.com/yonran/detect-zoom/blob/master/detect-zoom.js to jQuery?
[22:42:11] <spiffie> witchelles: though it's pretty rare for me to make selections based on ID, anyway. you have a structure that's pretty standard across all the rows. use that structure to craft selectors.
[22:42:28] <angela> hello, what are some of the reasons that can cause a jquery conflict?
[22:42:39] <angela> if selectors have the same name?
[22:42:47] <witchelles> I'm sorry, I'm sorry what?
[22:42:58] <donCams> zup?
[22:43:03] <Micha_> if the var $ is used too
[22:43:53] <spiffie> batousai: if you output $('meta[http-equiv]') to the console, do you get anything?
[22:44:10] <angela> ? oh...PHP conflicts
[22:44:17] <bot-t> angela, 12/02/2006 - Timeline  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline?from=2006-12-05&daysback=30&authors=
[22:44:22] <batousai> spiffie, trying...
[22:44:33] <Micha_> @spiffie yes
[22:44:34] <donCams> angela: more like variable conflicts
[22:44:49] <youngin> donCams!
[22:44:50] <youngin> angela!
[22:45:05] <donCams> hey youngin
[22:46:33] <youngin> donCams: is pacman gonna fight mayweather, you know anything about that
[22:47:11] <batousai> spiffie, { length: 0,  prevObject:   { '0':
[22:47:20] <donCams> no. mayweather already has a scheduled fight before he goes to jail. pacman wants 50-50, mayweather wants more
[22:47:23] <batousai> a huge array
[22:47:27] <angela> hi
[22:49:23] <batousai> spiffie, is it possible to select the content attribute with an each function?
[22:50:01] <spiffie> batousai: just to be clear, we're talking about a console in the sense of, say, Firebug for Firefox or Chrome's debugger, not some other console, yes?
[22:50:31] <batousai> spiffie, ubuntu's console
[22:50:46] <Es0teric> batousai… you watch Samurai X>
[22:50:47] <Es0teric> ?
[22:50:55] <batousai> yes
[22:51:04] <Es0teric> yeah… badass anime
[22:51:07] <batousai> real man slayer
[22:51:33] <Es0teric> he was the shit as batousai… when he did rurouni kenshin, he turned soft, like a lil bitch
[22:51:40] <Es0teric> *battousai
[22:51:51] <spiffie> batousai: does ubuntun's console give you the ability to inspect your page's structure? (haven't used ubuntu in three or four years)
[22:51:57] <spiffie> ubuntu
[22:52:09] <Es0teric> spiffie, Ubuntu 11.5 is dope..
[22:52:33] <batousai> spiffie, i can output the page in the console yes
[22:53:36] <spiffie> that's probably not the same thing. outputting the raw HTML as text isn't the same as inspecting the DOM in a browser
[22:54:42] <batousai> i see...
[22:54:45] <spiffie> what browser are you using?
[22:54:47] <batousai> spiffie, can i select the content attribute like this? $('meta http-equiv.refresh content').each(function(content) {content.rawtext}
[22:55:32] <spiffie> not as far as I'm aware. what is it you're tying to do?
[22:55:54] <batousai> <meta http-equiv=refresh content="1;URL='/aa/reservation/tripSearchProcess.do?bookingPathStateId=1330144155028-533'"/>
[22:56:03] <batousai> i want to select the content attribute there
[22:56:46] <spiffie> and you're trying to select it on a live page or from some scraped HTML?
[22:56:58] <batousai> scraped html
[22:57:44] <spiffie> oy
[22:58:34] <batousai> the script Im using managed to select a few tags with an each function
[22:58:50] <spiffie> you're pulling the page in with an AJAX request?
[22:59:26] <batousai> with a GET request
[22:59:32] <mchalk> what's the best way to output info to debug jquery stuff? in other contexts i can just use echo/print but not sure what to use with jquery
[22:59:33] * spiffie nods
[23:00:14] <youngin> donCams: fuck..
[23:00:23] <youngin> donCams: thats messed up
[23:00:45] <youngin> i thought mayweather was the one who wanted this fight so why he has to put up these demands to make sure it doesnt happen
[23:00:50] <spiffie> batousai: the only time I've done anything vaguely similar was when I had to parse out the script tags in the head of some arbitrary pages I was pulling in via a GET request.
[23:02:00] <youngin> I need to do a "if has Verdana, set font-size to 10px, else use sans-serif and set font-size to 11px" - how is this best achieved?
[23:02:03] <spiffie> and I also couldn't select them directly, even though I could select elements in the body. I couldn't tell you *why* that's the case, but yes actually iterating over the content in head and doing some very ugly textual inspection is probably the only way
[23:02:31] <angela> sorry, youngin, what was your message? I accidentally closed it
[23:02:47] <spiffie> mchalk: look into the console object
[23:02:56] <batousai> thats what seems to be happening to me now
[23:03:17] <batousai> cant each select a single attribute?
[23:04:45] <mchalk> thanks spiffie
[23:05:58] <mchalk> ok yes i'm having a weird glitch
[23:06:11] <mchalk> might be due to trying to put too many different scripts together
[23:06:38] <mchalk> for some reason offsetLeft is 0
[23:18:15] <batousai> can the each function select a single attribute that doesnt have an id when there are more than one of its parent tags on the page?
[23:19:56] <pcfreak30> Hello. i am trying to use the hotkeys plugin for shortcuts. I am using preventDefault() in my event handler though it seems that on the case I run a non-async ajax call, i get a save as dialog in my firefox browser with the callback dunction being ran as well. The sortcut is CTRL + S btw. Any Ideas?
[23:20:28] <pcfreak30> batousai: no, you need to use a selector to filter those out or i think jquery has a filter() function?
[23:20:39] <pcfreak30> look at the docs :)
[23:23:19] <batousai> the docs only show the each function selecting one tag
[23:24:05] <pcfreak30> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[23:24:56] <pcfreak30> $(selector).filter(selector or function).each
[23:25:01] <pcfreak30> :)
[23:26:08] <pcfreak30> or look at http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/, to see if theres a selector pattern you can use
[23:26:20] <pcfreak30> and u wont even need filter in that case
[23:28:20] <batousai> valid? $('meta[http-equiv=refresh] content').each(function (j, a) {}
[23:28:35] <batousai> i need to use an each
[23:28:44] <pcfreak30> hmm
[23:29:17] <pcfreak30> $("something [id='']")
[23:29:19] <pcfreak30> ?
[23:29:56] <batousai> the meta doesnt have an id
[23:30:05] <pcfreak30> eh tried nvm
[23:31:28] <here4thegear> snippet http://pastebin.com/pXzXAPnT  if I var somevar = getGeo(); it's returning an empty string. How do I fix this?
[23:31:59] <here4thegear> I'm sure it's a question of scope but not sure how to put it in scope
[23:34:34] <pcfreak30> http://jsfiddle.net/SF3Mm/
[23:34:41] <pcfreak30> batousai: http://jsfiddle.net/SF3Mm/
[23:34:46] <pcfreak30> theres an ex
[23:35:05] <pcfreak30> oh its a meta tag
[23:35:15] <pcfreak30> you prob can select by the tag type
[23:35:27] <pcfreak30> $("meta")
[23:35:42] <pcfreak30> yup u can
[23:35:44] <pcfreak30> just tried
[23:36:03] <pcfreak30> u can use classes, ids, or tag type/name in selectors
[23:36:17] <pcfreak30> so $("meta").each()
[23:36:18] <pcfreak30> :)
[23:36:48] <batousai> yes but there are more than one meta tags on the page
[23:37:08] <pcfreak30> or $("meta").filter(function(i, e){/*logic*/}).each(function(){/*logic*/});
[23:37:22] <pcfreak30> u pick :)
[23:38:46] <mehrdad> how do i bind an event in a calling code block to the callee ? can i pass the event? or pass a callback function? if i pass a callback, i must modify it in the callee because the caller code doesn't have access to objects needed
[23:39:21] <SirDerpsAlot> Is this even possible? I'm setting validationType prior to this: $.ccv.validationType
[23:39:36] <pcfreak30> mehrdad:  as many usually say. cide is better than words
[23:39:42] <pcfreak30> code
[23:39:47] <SirDerpsAlot> is there a way to make that call as the value of validationType?
[23:39:50] <mehrdad> ok
[23:40:05] <pcfreak30> as personally im a visual person to do so.
[23:41:55] <SirDerpsAlot> anyone?
[23:43:03] <pcfreak30> SirDerpsAlot: first this is random but nice nic :P. second as i told mehrdad, paste a code ex b/c it just easier to see than think on the concept.
[23:43:12] <SirDerpsAlot> Sure
[23:44:20] <here4thegear> snippet http://pastebin.com/pXzXAPnT  if I var somevar = getGeo(); it's returning an empty string. How do I fix this? I'm sure this is a scope issue but needs help
[23:44:45] <SirDerpsAlot> Thanks, I'm jQuery dumb. http://pastebin.com/0s1ppfcU
[23:44:56] <pcfreak30> u could say the bout me
[23:45:02] <pcfreak30> though i tend to learn fast
[23:45:19] <SirDerpsAlot> I've only really used mootools for the past few years
[23:45:21] <pcfreak30> a month ago i barely used jqiery. now im writing a mini library for a web app
[23:45:32] <pcfreak30> and learning as i go
[23:45:42] <SirDerpsAlot> trying to get familiar with jquery because I'm using Bootstrap a lot now
[23:45:45] <pcfreak30> tried mootools but jquery just gives more convience IMHO
[23:45:59] <SirDerpsAlot> I found mootools easier to read and work with
[23:46:05] <pcfreak30> u gotta love the "chainability"
[23:46:09] <SirDerpsAlot> but, tbh, I was a snob.
[23:46:22] <SirDerpsAlot> brb, need coffee
[23:46:32] <pcfreak30> i personally frown on that.
[23:47:53] <gf3> ?tell Wilto http://i.imgur.com/ryk4m.gif
[23:47:54] <bot-t> gf3, Okay.
[23:48:22] <SirDerpsAlot> back
[23:48:31] <SirDerpsAlot> so is there a way to do what I'm wanting to do with this?
[23:48:39] <batousai> $('meta[http-equiv=refresh]').each(function (j, a) {a.content} a.content is undefined :(
[23:48:41] <SirDerpsAlot> example for ccv was freaking buttons
[23:48:47] <SirDerpsAlot> I want to use a drop-down
[23:49:35] <pcfreak30> mk i see what u need to do
[23:49:44] <SirDerpsAlot> thanks for the help
[23:49:48] <pcfreak30> look
[23:49:51] <SirDerpsAlot> I need to buy a good jquery book
[23:49:57] <pcfreak30> um no
[23:50:00] <pcfreak30> u can
[23:50:07] <pcfreak30> persomnally i think books are a waste
[23:50:15] <pcfreak30> everything a book has google has
[23:50:22] <pcfreak30> its how ive learned tbh
[23:50:31] <pcfreak30> im basically self taught as well.
[23:50:32] <SirDerpsAlot> actually, I do have some ebooks around
[23:50:38] <SirDerpsAlot> novice to ninja I think
[23:50:42] <pcfreak30> http://bridge-belarus.org/Misc/ccv/ccv-0.1.0.js
[23:50:47] <diverdude> Hello.  I have a question regarding this small example: http://jsfiddle.net/aK3bG/  Why does it print ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] and not ["a", "b","c", "d", "e", "f"] ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] ?
[23:50:52] <SirDerpsAlot> I learned a lot about mootools from a book
[23:51:00] <pcfreak30> based on the ovbjecvt in ur code i taKE UR USING THE CCV JQUERY PKUGIN?
[23:51:04] <SirDerpsAlot> yeah, that one is what I'm using
[23:51:07] <SirDerpsAlot> yep
[23:51:09] <pcfreak30> mj
[23:51:15] <pcfreak30> look at the code itself
[23:51:25] <pcfreak30> ex from it
[23:51:26] <pcfreak30> amex : '3999 9999 9999 999',
[23:51:47] <pcfreak30> the predefine hash/object set for all cc's is in there
[23:52:13] <here4thegear> If I call this function -> http://pastebin.com/pXzXAPnT  like this -> var somevar = getGeo(); I am getting an empty string. I'm sure it's a scope issue with $.get but I need help sorting it out please.
[23:52:15] <pcfreak30> so u need to loop though and find the one u need and use it.
[23:52:35] <pcfreak30> i had to search and find this which may elp u.
[23:52:38] <pcfreak30> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/85992/how-do-i-enumerate-the-properties-of-a-javascript-object
[23:52:50] <diverdude> any1=
[23:52:51] <diverdude> ?
[23:53:10] <pcfreak30> u may just need to use a switch statemrnt as a cheap way. doing things past that i havent learned/figured out yet
[23:53:42] <SirDerpsAlot> seems complicated.
[23:54:01] <SirDerpsAlot> but I think I understand
[23:54:30] <pcfreak30> hmm
[23:54:44] <predikt> here4thegear: can you alert or console.log data to see if it's returning anything?
[23:54:46] <pcfreak30> if its true that u can treat a object as an array
[23:55:05] <pcfreak30> like var data = { a: 1, b: 2};
[23:55:18] <pcfreak30> var c = "a";
[23:55:23] <pcfreak30> data[c];
[23:55:29] <pcfreak30> and get 1
[23:55:39] <mehrdad> pcfreak30, nah, i don't want u to walk for me :) just tell me plz is it possible to pass an event directly?
[23:55:50] <pcfreak30> then in that case you can just use that to put the property of the cared type
[23:56:10] <here4thegear> predikt: yes, it's alerting the empty string
[23:56:28] <pcfreak30> mehrdad: i wouldnt know. i cant only help based on my exp and i havent needed to hack into the even system directly yet
[23:56:36] <pcfreak30> event
[23:56:54] <mehrdad> i want to bind the event in the call function
[23:57:22] <mehrdad> and i don't want to create an intermediate event between the two objects
[23:57:53] <predikt> here4thegear: what format of data are you trying to return? is it a string, json, etc?
[23:58:02] <pcfreak30> SirDerpsAlot: http://pastebin.com/rRTyi9bC, that may work.
[23:58:04] <mehrdad> i.e i don't want x.evt to trigger y.evt and then y.evt be passed to z
[23:58:15] <diverdude> Hello.  I have a question regarding this small example (array.splice): http://jsfiddle.net/aK3bG/  Why does it print ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] and not ["a", "b","c", "d", "e", "f"] ["a", "c", "d", "e", "f"] ? Is it some sort of threading issue in javascript?
[23:58:26] <mehrdad> y is the function that i must write the code
[23:58:48] <mehrdad> in
[23:59:42] <pcfreak30> SirDerpsAlot: as a test, look http://jsfiddle.net/mkHgx/
[23:59:48] <pcfreak30> same concept
[23:59:56] <here4thegear> predikt: the data is json data. line 3 I created var geoData line 5 I set geoData to the value of the JSON data returned from the $.get() and line 7 I'm returning GeoData. It appears that line 5 is not setting geoData due to scope.
