[00:02:25] <Whirl3d> coldhead did you get a promotion or have you always been an admin?
[00:02:54] <systemfault> coldhead had sexy time with an op...
[00:03:07] <systemfault> That's how he got it :/
[00:11:50] <D4> can I, with jQuery, check if the mouse is currently hovering a background image?
[00:12:19] <cheesypoof20> a specific background image or any background image
[00:12:42] <D4> Thing is, I'm having a bg image fixed which scrolls with the element, but for that to work I need to have its height set to 100% for it to follow the element down/up. Hence, the entire 100% height is "clickable" but the bg image is only a "arrow >"
[00:13:08] <D4> I want to do a check, and basically just make the image clickable and not the entire element
[00:13:41] <coldhead> it was an accident, Whirl3d
[00:15:23] <coldhead> so bored, buttock so itchy
[00:16:44] <D4> coldhead ª Gimme a tip on how to make a bg image clickable :D
[00:18:52] <Cork> D4: make the element with the bg clickable?
[00:19:29] <D4> Cork ª It is, but the thing is the "bg image" is only 48x48 pixels, but for it to "follow" the element on scroll, it's fixed hence its element is 100% height (about 1200px)
[00:20:16] <D4> So, making the entire "bar" clickable isn't desired as I want to implement a hover effect as well, so positioning the mouse on the bar, wherever would trigger the hover effect and, the entire bar would be clickable etc.. trying to make "button" but out of a bg image
[00:20:29] <coldhead> you can't
[00:20:52] <Cork> well you can, but you would have to do mouse coordinate calculations
[00:21:01] <Cork> that is, do all the work your self
[00:21:19] <coldhead> i can't*
[00:21:27] <coldhead> emmanuel kant
[00:21:38] <Cork> simplest is prob to just split it up into several elements instead
[00:21:41] <D4> eek, overkill. Okay, I understand. Any other ideas how I could achieve the same 'effect'? Previously I had the "button" top: value; altered as I scrolled, but in webkit that suttered like crazy.
[00:22:33] <Cork> D4: do you have an image or something of what your trying to achieve?
[00:22:43] <D4> Sure, gimme a sec I have a fiddle somewhere
[00:23:42] <Whirl3d> how do I check the bindings or an element?
[00:24:00] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/4/ <-- that is with the stutter, my first attempt at the button following its parent element "article" on scroll
[00:24:16] <Cork> Whirl3d: $._data(element, 'events')
[00:25:26] <sa2304> D4, why not split an element into two? First  is filled with bg and made clickable and second just covers remained space (e.g. 99% height)
[00:25:31] <huntedmitch> D4 What stuter? You mean where it flashes white? That's just a hover?
[00:25:54] <D4> huntedmitch ª The "button", on scroll, in webkit, stutters..
[00:25:56] <Cork> sa2304: try scrolling
[00:26:05] <D4> But not in IE/FF tho
[00:26:07] <huntedmitch> D4 ah webkit, I will look
[00:26:21] <Cork> D4: why not just position: fixed?
[00:26:28] <D4> Cork ª That was my 2nd attempt, 2 sec
[00:26:31] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/7/
[00:26:44] <D4> It doesn't work as, well.. it gives a lot of other unexpected bugs
[00:26:58] <huntedmitch> Isn't that actually your 7th attempt? :-P
[00:27:11] <Cork> D4: doens't work at all :)
[00:27:16] <coldhead> its all very difficult
[00:27:21] <D4> it's a pain :(
[00:27:24] <huntedmitch> Quiet coldhead :pP
[00:27:29] <coldhead> when's NY, huntedmitch
[00:27:33] <huntedmitch> Hey bud
[00:27:37] <D4> huntedmitch ª It's my 2nd attempt at the problem overall but 7th save in the fiddle .D
[00:27:40] <huntedmitch> Taking off this Friday for a few weeks
[00:27:48] <huntedmitch> Moving in a few months
[00:27:48] <coldhead> very good!
[00:27:54] <coldhead> MOVING to NY?!
[00:27:58] <huntedmitch> We're looking for Aussie js guys! ;-)
[00:28:10] <coldhead> if i ever learn JS i will let you know
[00:28:16] <huntedmitch> Yeah please do
[00:28:18] <huntedmitch> And tell your friends
[00:28:25] * huntedmitch bows
[00:28:53] <coldhead> well this all seems to be turning out very well for you
[00:28:56] <coldhead> congrats
[00:29:22] <huntedmitch> Yeah man, super happy with Hunted. Things were going great at the place before and then it just got suddenly awful.
[00:29:31] <huntedmitch> Thanks dude :-)
[00:29:37] <huntedmitch> What are you up to these days anyway?
[00:29:54] <D4> Cork ª mind if I pick your brain since I've t ried a few different approaches and can't really figure out which or what to do?
[00:31:32] <D4> And oh, the 7th didn't run at all for you? Well, then I've done something horribly wrong anyway. Does work for me, but not as desired and also it gives a few other really unexpected bugs to deal with ;p
[00:32:36] <D4> sa2304 ª Wait, hm. Split into two, and the first would have the 48x48 bg img (clickable) and the second would cover the remaining space? How would it move with the fixed image?
[00:35:18] <sa2304> If you want to make an image clickable, you should have an image, backgrounds are not clickable. At last try to implement fixed scrolling by yourself :)
[00:35:49] <sa2304> something with JS scroll event
[00:35:57] <D4> I have tried that as well
[00:36:57] <anli_> Is it possible to set ckeditor output compliancy?
[00:37:08] <anli_> That it should validate against html5, for instance
[00:37:22] <anli_> As it is now, a table gets cellspacing, which is old school
[00:37:37] <Jagan> how to download a file with ajax?
[00:37:38] <anli_> And cellpadding, and border etc
[00:38:11] <anli_> $.get('file.foo', function(thefile) { /* use the file */});
[00:39:40] <Whirl3d> D4 what doesn't work with the second one?
[00:39:54] <cheesypoof20> I have a shopping cart that upon product add/removal the html contents of the cart div gets replaced. I am having trouble figuring out how I can successfully implement a few things, such as a slideDown for the 'add to cart' button only after the cart div contents have been replaced and preventing the cart div from disappearing when it is visible and I click a 'remove' button inside of it that
[00:39:54] <cheesypoof20> triggers the .html cart div replacement. http://jsfiddle.net/ZUmK9/2/ The xsl and php backend files are present so the example is not entirely representative.
[00:40:09] <D4> Well, for starters it should start half way through (being centered/middled) - secondly, it didn't work at all for cork
[00:40:13] <D4> @ Whirl3d
[00:40:14] <Cork> D4: sorry for the delay, got a phone call http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/8/
[00:41:15] <cheesypoof20> not present*
[00:41:17] <D4> Cork ª Would that button only be "visible" in its element? As in, that article?
[00:41:32] <Cork> D4: no is fixed
[00:41:40] <Cork> its fixed to the window element
[00:42:37] <D4> Cork ª Yeah, okay. I need it to only be for that article; since I'm going to have more "sections" that are working like, well you can click the button and go to its details view and back. So each "article" would have this navigational button to it
[00:43:02] <Whirl3d> I don't get how that first if statement does anything...doesn't it lose the next reference immediately since it is declared inside the if statement?
[00:43:04] <D4> The fiddle just shows 1 article that has this functionality and another which doesn't
[00:43:05] <Cork> D4: why don't you just have one for all?
[00:43:14] <Cork> and switch witch one it affects?
[00:43:36] <D4> Cork ª It looks different per 'article' and for some it shouldn't be visible at all.
[00:43:51] <stenno> good day, i am using the jquery-ui autocomplete widget(?), and i wonder, when exactly is the 'change' event triggered?
[00:44:36] <stenno> it is neither when i change the text of my textfield, nor when i navigate in the suggestion list
[00:45:00] <D4> Cork ª how would I set something like that up? So it "knows" what article it is in and e.g. change hover effect or image or something as the nav button isn't alike on all articles, sometimes it should have a black bg and others green etc.
[00:45:32] <stenno> the documentary says Triggered when the field is blurred, if the value has changed;
[00:45:46] <Cork> D4: the offset parents scrollTop + the position of the respective element
[00:47:02] <Cork> D4: the problem with using anything other then fixed is that js isn't always triggered on scroll updates to make the browser scroll smoother
[00:47:08] <Cork> so your js updates lag
[00:48:08] <ravenzz> what is less heavy a find() or a siblings() ?
[00:48:23] <Cork> siblings
[00:48:39] <Cork> siblings runs on the set of childNotes
[00:48:47] <D4> Cork ª Aha, thanks for the input. I think I'll have to go with making it fixed with CSS and having the entire 'nav' clickable and not just the image then.
[00:48:50] <Cork> while find traverses the child tree
[00:48:55] <D4> (background image)
[00:49:07] <ravenzz> so siblings() doesn't go a level up, select the parent() and then the children again
[00:49:20] <Cork> nope
[00:49:24] <ravenzz> k
[00:49:25] <ravenzz> ty
[00:57:24] <nights> ok nice
[00:57:36] <nights> sending apologies to 15 users

[00:58:01] <stenno> :|)
[00:58:16] <stenno> (|:
[01:03:08] <cheesypoof20> Any idea how I could go about this better so that the cart div slides down on an 'add to cart' click. Also, so the cart div stays open if a form is submitted inside of it. http://jsfiddle.net/ZUmK9/2/
[01:05:09] <rethus> whats a good and easy ticker-plugin to scroll images horizontal
[01:15:57] <sa2304> What is the this context of $.ajax success callback?
[01:16:23] <sa2304> can I change it?
[01:17:23] <ravenzz> :?
[01:17:45] <ravenzz> be more specific
[01:18:42] <sa2304> I want to use $(this) inside of success function. Just using my own plugin I want to make it reentrant
[01:19:04] <sa2304> So that's I can pass ajaxSuccess in my plugin's options
[01:19:20] <sa2304> and it will be called on specific element
[01:19:27] <sa2304> is it possible?
[01:19:30] <xec|work> sa2304: save it in a var outside of the callback, the name "$this" is often used for that purpose
[01:19:46] <ravenzz> so it is a scope issue
[01:19:48] <ravenzz> ?
[01:19:54] <sa2304> yes
[01:19:59] <ravenzz> var selfOrwhatever = this;
[01:20:16] <ravenzz> or $(this) if you are willing to use the jquery object
[01:20:50] <sa2304> of course, but I want to change this context before sucess will be called
[01:20:54] <ravenzz> so you will be able to use selfOrwhatever within the ajax callback
[01:22:10] <ravenzz> var self = this; $.post('foo.php', function(data){ self.love() });
[01:26:04] <Nece228> can i retrieve .post data?
[01:26:14] <Nece228> in like other document
[01:26:48] <Nece228> i basically have a form, i send it, open url, and want to retrieve the form data with jquery
[01:27:15] <ravenzz> you can do same domain requests
[01:27:27] <Nece228> what do you mean?
[01:27:35] <ravenzz> or cross domain if you have somehow control on the target server
[01:27:50] <ravenzz> that you can do post request to nasa.gov
[01:27:53] <ravenzz> for example
[01:28:02] <stenno|work> for example
[01:28:33] <ravenzz> you cannot do
[01:28:33] <ravenzz> :P
[01:28:57] <Nece228> well im wondering of the best way
[01:29:32] <Nece228> basically when i click on button i should open url, but when i open new url which has seperate script i need to retrieve the value of that button
[01:30:54] <stenno|work> i wonder, setting $(elem).data("foo", 23); is the same as <elem data-foo='23'>, right?
[01:31:07] <ravenzz> it isn't
[01:31:10] <stenno|work> oh
[01:31:15] <Cork> stenno|work: : yes an no
[01:31:22] * stenno|work is confus
[01:31:27] <Cork> data-foo will set .data
[01:31:28] <stenno|work> how is it different?
[01:31:32] <Cork> but .data won't set data-
[01:31:32] <ravenzz> I mean you won't have the data-foo in the markup
[01:31:37] <stenno|work> i see
[01:31:40] <stenno|work> that was my problem
[01:31:46] <ravenzz> use attr()
[01:32:04] <stenno|work> when i send a post with data set by data(..), it will still be posted?
[01:32:06] <ravenzz> if your values are going to be Strings
[01:32:08] <Cork> additionally data-foo will be a string while your data- will be a nunber
[01:32:11] <stenno|work> although it doesn't get rendered?
[01:32:12] <stenno|work> ah
[01:32:17] <Cork> *uf .data will be
[01:32:53] <stenno|work> alright i think i will just use .attr for clarification
[01:32:56] <Cork> stenno|work: .data doens't affect forms
[01:32:57] <stenno|work> thanks guys :)
[01:33:04] <stenno|work> oh i see
[01:33:11] <Cork> its just for storing data
[01:33:19] <stenno|work> so its only virtual data not to be bound to the dom
[01:33:20] <stenno|work> i see
[01:33:24] <ravenzz> yep
[01:33:26] <stenno|work> 'virtual data'
[01:33:30] <ravenzz> and also you don't have a data selector
[01:33:33] <Cork> its same with data- actually
[01:33:50] <ravenzz> so $('[data-foo]') won't work for ex
[01:33:50] <Cork> except its an attribute in the dom
[01:33:52] <stenno|work> huh? i thought data- would be send with the POST request
[01:33:56] <stenno|work> i see
[01:33:57] <Cork> nope
[01:34:06] <stenno|work> hmm that is a problem
[01:34:13] <stenno|work> i have to use hidden fields then
[01:34:19] <Cork> stenno|work: if you want the dom to affect form, use hidden input fields
[01:34:22] <Cork> yes
[01:34:22] <stenno|work> or append to the query string
[01:34:25] <stenno|work> yes
[01:34:30] * Cork nods
[01:34:37] <stenno|work> hmm thats sad :(
[01:34:38] <ravenzz> stenno|work you can grab all the values on submit and send them anyway
[01:37:28] <sa2304> ravenzz, thanks, I found unnecessary level of abstraction in my application logic )
[01:37:52] <sa2304> Everything should be okay now
[01:38:01] <coldhead> forever
[01:39:07] <joobie> hey guys.. anyone got a neat jquery stop watch timer example?
[01:40:49] <Cork> joobie: stopwatch? what do you need?
[01:41:15] <Cork> an actual clock rendering?
[01:41:28] <ravenzz> coldhead :D
[01:41:39] <Cork> or just a timer that can be stopped and started, with reliable step sizes?
[01:41:41] <ravenzz> sa2304 you're welcome
[02:06:16] <eshlox> string "test, test1,test2", how check if any if comma separated strings (with trim) has length < 3 and then return false? any better idea than $.each(tags.split(','), function()?

[02:06:56] <stenno|work> er
[02:07:01] <stenno|work> $.grep
[02:07:20] <stenno|work> depending on what you really want...
[02:10:41] <here4thegear> is anyone using jquery.mobile ? When I'm loading data via ajax none of the data-role= items are rendering.
[02:11:23] <stenno|work> ha!
[02:12:22] <mikkelb> Hey everyone
[02:12:45] <mikkelb> Brodingo: whats up man
[02:12:50] <mikkelb> coldhead: oh hey girl :-)
[02:15:06] <mikkelb> whats good in the hood on this glorious day??
[02:15:25] <stenno|work> sun is shining
[02:15:28] <stenno|work> the weather is sweet
[02:15:32] <stenno|work> makes me want to move
[02:15:35] <stenno|work> my dancing feet
[02:15:48] <stenno|work> to the rescue!
[02:15:50] <here4thegear> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible.html so, I'm using .append() to render items similar to the first code junk here. The problem seems that mobile only does what it does on page load. Is there anything that I can do to force mobile to account for new dom elements?
[02:15:58] <mikkelb> stenno|work: now we're talking!!!!!!
[02:16:02] <stenno|work> :D
[02:23:18] <BrutusUnix> I have a script that checks an input box for " if I only put one " at the end of the text box the validator tools can't handle it and script says "test""

[02:27:15] <bot-t> BrutusUnix, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:28:54] <ravenzz> do someone can take a look at this on IE8 http://jsfiddle.net/FAerc/ ?
[02:29:10] <ravenzz> it is working even on ie7 ...
[02:31:59] <Cork> ravenzz: [for*="on"] won't work
[02:32:06] <Cork> thats not a valid css selector
[02:32:16] <Cork> (its a valid sizzle selector though)
[02:32:37] <Cork> same with off
[02:32:52] <ravenzz> it is css3 valid
[02:33:18] <Cork> but ie doesn't support that
[02:33:33] <ravenzz> ie < 9
[02:33:50] <ravenzz> that's the reason why I have that js
[02:34:58] <ravenzz> which actually is working for IE7 but not in IE8
[02:38:42] <here4thegear> So, Jquerymobile, apparently, only puts event listeners on elements that exist. Normally, I use $(element).live() so that, when I do an ajax call of any sort, new elements created with .append() will still be effected even though they weren't in the DOM on ready initially. Is there something that I can do in mobile to force elements to persist in a similar way?
[02:42:21] <stenno|work> .live should work for mobile too
[02:47:21] <here4thegear> stenno|work: the problem I'm having is basically the same thing as this question in stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7999436/jquery-mobile-does-not-apply-styles-after-dynamically-adding-content
[02:47:33] <here4thegear> I'm going through the suggested ideas within that now to see what I can do.
[02:54:02] <ravenzz> Cork it was a CSS issue
[02:54:39] <ravenzz> IE8 was ignoring this .switch .checked, .switch input:checked + label { }
[02:54:55] <ravenzz> I have splitted it in two rules

[02:56:23] <Web-Gate> Hi

[03:01:18] <Berl> Hi pls suggest jquery plugin for twitter style @mention
[03:09:27] <Web-Gate> Hum... someone active ?
[03:10:28] <xec_> ?ask @ Web-Gate
[03:10:29] <bot-t> Web-Gate, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:11:19] <Web-Gate> .. Anyone knows why this don't work .. ? http://lab.web-gate.fr/jq/drawing/
[03:11:46] <xec_> define "doesn't work"
[03:12:07] <yango> Is there a way to force the browser to ignore certain keyevents?
[03:13:15] <xec_> yango: not globally afaik, but you could listen to them and return false;
[03:13:40] <xec_> but it sounds like a bad idea tbh
[03:14:00] <stenno|work> $("*").click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); :D
[03:14:17] <stenno|work> disclaimer: don't do that
[03:15:18] <yango> in fact my question is a loaded solution to my problem, which is rather complex. Basically it boils down to: I have a DataTable with KeyTable and jeditable. I can navigate on the table using the tab key, BUT, when the jeditable is triggered within a cell, a tab press is not suppressed and goes all the way up to the browser, and the table loses focus. When only using keytable the tab does not make the table lose the focus.
[03:15:53] <xec_> jeditable = jedi table?! :D
[03:15:58] <yango> I wish
[03:16:17] <yango> it's more like sith punishment table
[03:16:33] <xec_> lol
[03:17:15] <yango> and I'm a bit lost as to how to debug this properly, I see event.stopPropagation() called in jquery itself
[03:17:25] <yango> but still the table loses focus
[03:17:48] <xec_> stopPropagation is not the same as preventDefault
[03:18:06] <stenno|work> indeed
[03:18:21] <yango> let me run through it again
[03:18:27] <yango> I seem to recall it called both
[03:18:48] <xec_> also, you would need to prevent the correct key event as well
[03:19:21] <yango> both are called... and jeditable returns false on that event
[03:19:36] <xec_> if i remember correctly, it is keydown
[03:19:49] <xec_> let me check
[03:21:25] <xec_> yango: http://jsfiddle.net/V2zev/ -- return false; is equivalent to both stopPropagation and preventDefault
[03:23:30] <Chibby_> can anyone please tell me if the best way to select say the third element from a set of matched elements is to do .eq(2) or is there a faster way to do it?
[03:24:03] <stenno|work> is there not nth-child ?
[03:24:10] <stenno|work> css3 pseudoselector?
[03:24:51] <xec_> there is!
[03:25:28] <xec_> Chibby_: is there something wrong with .eq() ?
[03:25:45] <Chibby_> i don't know, that's why i was asking (:
[03:26:02] <stenno|work> seems like the best way...
[03:26:19] <xec_> it was pretty much designed for exactly the purpose you described
[03:26:24] <yango> short of having a known unique id in the element
[03:26:42] <tga> when working with deferreds I can't just chain def1.done(def2).done(def3), right?
[03:26:44] <Chibby_> cool, thanks
[03:26:57] <tga> I have to do def1.done(def2.done(def3))?
[03:27:21] * tga tries to organize a pretty long chain of asyncs
[03:28:00] * yango wishes tga luck
[03:28:16] <tga> yeah, thanks
[03:28:36] <tga> I also figured bubbling the errors back will be messy
[03:30:55] <tga> is there any decent way of chaining asyncs that doesn't include nesting calls?
[03:31:09] <tga> throwing them all in an array and looping it maybe?
[03:31:55] <tga> actually that might just work
[03:32:02] <stenno|work> i think there is a 'step' plugin for jquery but i don't know
[03:32:08] <stenno|work> i know there is one for node.js
[03:32:23] <tga> I can just iterate an array and then register .done() calls on each function with a ref to the next function
[03:35:18] <yango> and how are you going to wait for the next?
[03:37:14] <tga> actually .when([array of deferreds]) seems to be what I need
[03:37:34] <tga> it generates an aggregate deferred for all objects in the array
[03:38:24] <tga> uhh I'm not sure about the order in which .when calls objects though
[03:38:47] <tga> yango, I don't need to wait for the next, I chain them one to the other and then fire the first one
[03:40:36] <riku9000> is there an event handler for iframe reload? i made a fileupload form that sends the input to iframe and i would like to refresh the filelist after the fileupload is finished
[03:51:09] <Archer_xda> riku9000 : Make the iframe trigger a function in the parent window instead.  Make the parent ignore it 1st time.
[03:51:46] <riku9000> good idea :) thanks
[03:52:59] <Archer_xda> np :)
[03:58:34] <riku9000> Archer_xda, it seems that the iframe cant use the functions of the parent window :s
[03:59:07] <riku9000> just says that the function is undefined
[03:59:15] <Archer_xda> riku9000 : Are you calling parent.function() ?
[03:59:48] <stenno|work> iframes :<
[03:59:49] <riku9000> i dont think so ^^
[03:59:59] <stenno|work> messing with the dom since the 90ies
[04:00:03] <riku9000> :D
[04:00:09] <yango> how can I tell which event a certain jQuery.event instance belongs to?
[04:00:12] <riku9000> just want to create a simple ajax fileupload
[04:00:31] <yango> it has like a gazillion members/properties
[04:00:38] <riku9000> or i wanted to, but this method seems to be a bit easier
[04:01:21] <Archer_xda> riku9000 : It will be easier, but obviously have different obstacles to overcome.  Could you not use an existing plugin?  There's tons of them for file uploaders
[04:01:41] <riku9000> i know
[04:01:47] <riku9000> but i think its working now :)
[04:01:51] <Archer_xda> Cool
[04:02:51] <iman> I am reading some dictionary's pronunciation, I confronted with such as these characters …°…ít and …°…ëÀêt and Àå ånd…ôÀàst äd ,  these sent to client through Ajax and have shown in HTML page like ????? symbol, what do you think about this problem ?
[04:04:56] <iman> additionally this characters seem OK before send to client and page character has been set utf-8
[04:05:50] <stenno|work> stupid jquery-ui widget styling :<
[04:05:59] <stenno|work> i have to use !important now :<
[04:08:34] <xec_> stenno|work: you really don't
[04:08:44] <Archer_xda> iman : does html encoding not help?
[04:09:05] <stenno|work> well then i have to tell jquery-ui to not set attributes plx kthx
[04:09:08] <iman> Archer_xda: no
[04:09:52] <xec_> stenno|work: telling doesn't always work, have you tried begging?
[04:10:21] <stenno|work> yes, i went on my knees
[04:10:23] <stenno|work> still
[04:10:38] <Archer_xda> stenno|work : He said begging, not blowing
[04:10:40] <sjeijk> hi guys, does anyone know a script to handle mouseover dropdownmenu's on the iPad and iPhone with a 1st click to open and another click to pick something from the menu? Its for www.paushuize.nl
[04:10:42] <stenno|work> :D
[04:11:45] <Archer_xda> :O
[04:13:21] <chilversc_> sjeijk: mouseover should just work? have you tried it and seen what happens?
[04:13:51] <sjeijk> well chilversc_ on iPad/phone people don't use mouse hover
[04:14:17] <sjeijk> so thats kind of the whole problem :p
[04:14:50] <chilversc_> sjeijk: if you attach a hover event the first tap initiates hover instead of click, second tap is then click
[04:15:03] <sjeijk> i think i need to write it from scratch but my jquery knowledge is a bit poor, so i was hoping for some script
[04:15:16] <chilversc_> sjeijk: it can be annoying when using a site that makes use of say, qtip, because everytime you tap a nav button, you get the qtip, and you have to double tab
[04:15:42] <stenno|work> xec_, now seriously, jquery-ui does some very nasty styling (sets width, height...). how would i use css without !important to change that?
[04:16:12] <sjeijk> ok tx chilversc_ i'll look into hover
[04:16:16] <Flo0815> hi, i have a animation (fadeIn, rotate). In IE 9.0.8 it only running, if i open the development window (like firebug in Firefox). Does somebody know what's the problem there?
[04:16:37] <stenno|work> Flo0815, those console.log things only work with open console
[04:16:52] <xec_> stenno|work: you can change just about anything about jquery ui, it's very flexible
[04:16:56] <stenno|work> otherwise it will throw errors and the js wont be executed
[04:17:07] <stenno|work> xec_ i know, i read about the Styling
[04:17:18] <xec_> stenno|work: but without something specific it's very hard to tell what you need to do
[04:18:06] <Flo0815> stenno|work: i know. but if theres a console.log in the code and the concole is not open, does it block the animation then?
[04:18:53] <stenno|work> well something specific: i am using the autocomplete widget, and it shows me a list of suggestions when i type in a letter or w/e, just as expected. unfortunately the list is not where i want it to be. i have to set stuff like width or height, and css precendence prevents to solve it just by writing something in a css file
[04:19:06] <stenno|work> Flo0815, sure could be
[04:19:20] <stenno|work> dunno what microsoft browsers do when they have to handle js errors
[04:20:40] <Sid-G> hey, if i use a $.each function within an outer js function; would variables of the outer function be accessible in the inner one? and if any changes are made to objects declared in the outer function, would they be usable in the outer function, or just in the jquery function?
[04:21:57] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 : console still works in Chrome, even when closed.  Try using that
[04:22:29] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 : I find it better for logging errors and debugging
[04:23:51] <xec_> stenno|work: have you looked at the custom display demo of the autocomplete? it shows how to customize the html for each rendered item, maybe it's possible to do something similar for the entire suggestion box as well?
[04:26:12] <vl1234> hi hi...........how to change input type=text into text area whenever focus the input field
[04:26:13] <bot-t> (5 hours 21 mins ago) <coldhead> tell vl1234 i will never forget you
[04:26:40] <vl1234> here a tried replacewith concept but am not able to find
[04:26:55] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 : I've had problems with scripts not running in IE, due to console.log statements.  As soon as I removed them it worked.  Do a check for console.log first - maybe write a function to do logging and have that check for you
[04:26:58] <sjeijk> i don't think its going to work chilversc_
[04:27:13] <vl1234> any other method to solve this problem
[04:28:07] <sjeijk> or else this would have worked > $("ul#nav li").hover( function () { return false; }, function () { return true; }
[04:28:22] <sjeijk> but iPad still takes the click
[04:28:23] <Cork> vl1234: $('input[type="text"]').each(function() { var self = $(this); self.replaceWith($('<textarea/>', { id: self.prop('id'), name: self.prop('name') text: self.val()})) })
[04:28:30] <Cork> vl1234: something like that
[04:29:20] <vl1234> @crok thankzzzzzz and get back to u
[04:29:51] <Cork> vl1234: thats written completly without testing, so be prepared for typos and miss remembering :)
[04:30:38] <Sid-G> if my question is too noobish, plz direct me to a site for noobs. The official jquery documentation doesn't answer my question :)
[04:30:39] <vl1234> ya i ill
[04:31:33] <Cork> Sid-G: not sure what you mean, but if you mean if an inline function can access variables from its parent, then yes
[04:31:36] <stenno|work> xec_, well the problem is that jquery writes stuff like that _directly_ in the style attribute of the element in the markup:
[04:31:38] <stenno|work>  style="z-index: 1; top: 0px; left: 0px; display: none;"
[04:31:40] <Cork> Sid-G: its called scoping
[04:31:48] <stenno|work> so even setting it in a css file wont override it
[04:31:55] <stenno|work> without !important
[04:32:13] <xec_> stenno|work: i take that as a "no, i have not looked at the custom display demo" ;)
[04:32:16] <Sid-G> Cork: so an inner function can modify an object declared in its parent function?
[04:32:25] <Cork> Sid-G: yes
[04:32:38] <Sid-G> Cork: k, thnx
[04:32:39] <johnline3> data_config:function(img){return{title:$(img).attr('alt'),description:$(img).attr('title')};},

[04:34:56] <Cork> ec8or_: nope, you need to loop
[04:36:33] <iman> how can i convert a unicode number to character in javascript
[04:36:34] <iman> ?
[04:36:35] <Pupeno_W> What would be the proper format/datatype to be used to request a piece of HTML from the server using ajax?
[04:37:13] <Cork> Pupeno_W: text/html
[04:37:20] <eshlox> hm, it's possible to download image on click instead of display using jquery/js?

[04:37:58] <ec8or_> Cork: ok thanks
[04:38:19] <iman> mydog2: thanks
[04:38:27] <Cork> iman: you have to pass it through the dom parser
[04:38:47] <Pupeno_W> Cork: so the only way for the server to know that it should return a fragment instead of a full page is for the ajax request to include an extra argument?
[04:39:01] <Cork> nope
[04:39:06] <Cork> you have a header for xhr

[04:40:39] <johnline3> i neb help w/ javascribt :<
[04:44:19] <Archer_xda> johnline3 - you need help with spelling :p
[04:44:27] <Archer_xda> johnline3 - what's up?
[04:47:20] <johnline3> data_config:function(img){return{title:$(img).attr('alt'),description:$(img).attr('title')};},
[04:47:20] <johnline3> i have this line of code running in an external file from the html doc and the img references dont seem to hook. is there some different reference i have to use, like 'document.img'
[04:47:27] <johnline3> :–
[04:48:01] <Archer_xda> how are you running it?
[04:48:38] <johnline3> running it via this in the html: Galleria.loadTheme('../include/galleria/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js');
[04:49:36] <Archer_xda> replace the function code with console.log(img) so you can check what's getting passed in.
[04:50:03] <Archer_xda> Then you'll know if it's your function or the calling code that's at fault
[04:50:13] <Archer_xda> The function looks fine (first glance)
[04:50:13] <Sid-G> Cork: Hey, is this right? $.each(form.elements, function(k, v) {.do stuff.});
[04:50:40] <Archer_xda> Sid-G : $("selector").each etc..
[04:50:45] <Cork> Sid-G: most likly no
[04:50:59] <SynchronE> hi everyone! Can anyone tell me where to look for ajaxTransport documentation ?
[04:51:24] <johnline3> if i put the data_config line in the html it works fine, just trying to see if i can minimise repetitive code
[04:52:05] <Sid-G> cork: so $(form.elements).each(function(k,v) {}); here form is an html form. Would this iterate over all of the form's elements?
[04:52:11] <Cork> ?.ajaxTransport @ johnline3

[04:52:22] <Cork> uh...
[04:52:34] <Cork> johnline3: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Transports
[04:52:57] <Cork> Sid-G: what is it your trying to do?
[04:53:43] <Sid-G> Cork: trying to get all checked/selected/elements with input from an html form ambedded in a jquery dialog; and then making the function do stuff
[04:53:50] <Sid-G> *embedded
[04:54:08] <Sid-G> Cork: u've probably realized I'm a noob :D
[04:54:36] <Cork> Sid-G: have you looked at serializeArray? see ?.serializeArray
[04:54:37] <bot-t> Sid-G, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[04:54:58] * Sid-G goes to look
[04:55:40] <SynchronE> Cork: can i myself fire a progress event from a custom ajax transport ?
[04:55:41] <Cork> Sid-G: if you want to prepare the form for ajax submit thats prob what you want
[04:56:11] <Cork> SynchronE: not sure, never tried but most likely
[04:56:16] <Sid-G> Cork: actually I have to do stuff with the properties of the elements to create an object for a callback fn
[04:56:36] <Sid-G> Cork: i'm using the name and value props of the elements
[04:57:13] <Cork> Sid-G: in what form do you have the elements you want to work with?
[04:57:39] <Sid-G> Cork: uh, what do u mean what form?
[04:57:45] <Pupeno_W> Is there some way to know whether I called tokenInput() on an element already or not?
[04:58:18] <Cork> Sid-G: do you have just have a form and want the element from it; do you have a jquery object; ,,,?
[04:58:40] <Cork> Pupeno_W: whats tockenInput?
[04:58:47] <Sid-G> Cork: just a form
[04:58:55] <stenno|work> anyway, set a flag :)
[04:59:03] <Cork> Sid-G: form.find('input').each
[04:59:15] <Sid-G> Cork: I had some error with the simple for in loop of js, and was recommended to use jquery each to fix it
[04:59:19] <Cork> ?.data @ Pupeno_W
[04:59:19] <bot-t> Pupeno_W, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:59:51] <Cork> Sid-G: hmm btw and what reference do you have for form?
[04:59:59] <johnline3> thanks for the help
[05:00:08] <Cork> id?, dom?, jquery object?
[05:00:14] <johnline3> i think i am too clueless to pull this off so will stick with what works for now
[05:00:26] <Pupeno_W> Cork: it's a query plug in.
[05:00:38] <Pupeno_W> Cork: I'm going to use data if there's no better way already.
[05:01:09] <stenno|work> xec_, actually _reading_ the custom data autocomplete example was a good hint >_>" thanks
[05:01:12] <Sid-G> Cork: ok, serializearray wont work. And I know that I have a variable called form which is the target of an event. AFAIK the variable refers to the html form element.
[05:01:15] <Cork> Pupeno_W: if a plugin has been run on a dom element, only shows if it leaves a mark behind
[05:01:27] <Cork> Pupeno_W: its up to the plugin to create that information
[05:01:43] <xec_> stenno|work: :)
[05:01:43] <Pupeno_W> Cork: I was hopping that there's some kind of convention in place for this kind of stuff.
[05:01:44] <Cork> (and one of the reasons jquery have .data)
[05:01:54] <bj0rn_> What is the recommended way to use jquery with class-style javascript programming? (binding jquery events to methods of javascript class instances)
[05:02:04] <Cork> Pupeno_W: there is, and it is .data
[05:02:10] <Cork> or a class
[05:02:29] <Cork> depending if you want it to be selectable or not
[05:02:46] <Pupeno_W> Cork: that's not a convention,  a convention would be if plug ins would add "jquery-$plug_in_name-run" => true, to data.
[05:03:05] <Cork> Pupeno_W: its not made automatically no
[05:03:13] <Cork> Pupeno_W: most plugins doens't need it
[05:03:51] <Pupeno_W> I would have even expected plugins like token input to be idempotent.
[05:04:17] <Sid-G> Cork: so $(form.elements).each(function(k,v) {}); will work? considering form is the html form? I'm asking coz I dont know what .elements is doing here and what it means
[05:04:54] <Cork> Sid-G: i can't tell you that until you answer my question :)
[05:05:15] <Cork> Sid-G: hmm btw and what reference do you have for form? <--
[05:05:19] <Cork> id?, dom?, jquery object?
[05:05:24] <Sid-G> Cork: I thought I already did
[05:05:46] <Cork> Sid-G: ok, where does it come from?
[05:05:55] <Sid-G> And I know that I have a variable called form which is the target of an event. AFAIK the variable refers to the html form element. <-- All I know. I think that would qualify as dom?
[05:06:19] <Cork> Sid-G: its set from this?
[05:06:59] <Cork> Sid-G: what needs to be done depends on what you have there
[05:07:11] <Sid-G> Cork: The form variable comes from e.target on clicking a button in the form embedded in a jquery dialog
[05:07:27] <Cork> ok, so its a dom native
[05:07:44] <Cork> $(form).find('input').each(function() {});
[05:08:06] <Cork> if you want a more specific selector then input just replace it
[05:08:08] <Sid-G> this wouldn't include textareas?
[05:08:12] <Cork> no
[05:08:21] <Cork> its css, just modify the selector :)
[05:08:28] <Sid-G> i can have multiple there?
[05:08:31] <Cork> yes
[05:08:34] <Cork> just like in css
[05:09:09] <Sid-G> ok
[05:09:34] <Sid-G> Cork: thanks a lot :)
[05:09:40] <Cork> np
[05:09:49] <Sid-G> $(form).find('input', 'textarea').each(function() {}); is right?
[05:09:54] <Cork> no
[05:10:02] <Cork> $(form).find('input, textarea').each(function() {});
[05:10:09] * Sid-G sighs
[05:10:15] <Cork> one string with the selector
[05:10:40] <Sid-G> ohkay
[05:18:51] <D4> How do I use .show() to do display: block; instead of inline on a <span> since it's inline by default?
[05:19:29] <SophieTitWank> D4 - if it's just show, use .css("display","block")
[05:19:38] <D4> all right, thanks.
[05:24:15] <Cork> D4: or before you hide it set display: block;
[05:24:36] <Cork> $(elm).css('display', 'block').hide(); $(elm).show()
[05:25:13] <Cork> .hide stores the old display value
[05:27:46] <SophieTitWank> Cork - thanks, I didn't know that
[05:28:04] <SophieTitWank> so you could use that with an interval param for fading?
[05:28:27] <Cork> everything that falls back on show hide yes
[05:31:20] <SophieTitWank> Nice.  Thanks :)
[05:31:32] <mikeyii> Could somebody help me rewrite some simple javascript function to jquery function?
[05:32:08] <kjbjh> ciao
[05:32:26] <kjbjh> !lista
[05:32:38] <Cork> kjbjh: thers no bots here
[05:32:56] <xec_> lol
[05:33:18] <xec_> mikeyii: with 894 clients connected, i would say it is likely that *somebody* can help, but not without some more details ;)
[05:33:19] <Cork> so damn tired of those ciao | !list/!lista users >_<
[05:34:12] <mikeyii> I have 2 dropdown boxes (one with xml node names and one with datatypes) and when a user selects an option in the first dropdown I want to select another value in the second dropdown. I made this function in javascript but now I replaced the first dropdown with a jquery multiselect and therefore rewriting the function to jquery as it should also have better browser support
[05:34:24] <mikeyii> xec_: sorry was writing :D
[05:35:59] <mikeyii> but the pain is there is not just 2 dropdowns but those 2 can be repeated unlimited. So in javascript I checked the ID of the first dropdown and used that ID to know what the ID of the second dropdown would be.
[05:36:03] <xec_> mikeyii: i'm not sure what you mean by "jquery multiselect", is it some plugin?
[05:36:20] <mikeyii> the ID names + current javascript and what multiselect I use are summed in here: http://pastebin.com/RJ7r4Fpt
[05:36:58] <xec_> nevermind, i see the link at the end ther
[05:39:53] <mikeyii> I gave the first dropdown;s a class (.multiselect) so I know which is the first select and what the second (P.S. the multiselect seems to work like checkboxes).
[05:42:21] <mikeyii> To make things more complicated I want to write some if statements if seleted > 2 then disable all data types except string / text (int, boolean etc. are useless with combined fields).
[05:42:48] <mikeyii> this also means that fields will also have to be enabled when selected < 2.
[05:43:25] <mikeyii> sinds I have no experience in jquery this got me puzzled :D
[05:43:57] <stenno|work> mikeyii, do you have a specific question..?
[05:45:07] <ravenzz> mikeyii I have a jquery plugin which converts a multiple select into two UL so you can select the values from the 1st and have them in the 2nd.
[05:45:16] <ravenzz> are you trying to do that?
[05:45:54] <mikeyii> I;m trying to auto select the type of a xml node if only 1 is selected (first is node names second select is data types).
[05:47:15] <defa> morning folks, not sure what my officemate is talking about regarding modal window. Unfortunately, he's on the other side of the world. He told me not to use my own jquery. I used the jquery he wrote on the html. He told me to use jquery ui.
[05:47:31] <mikeyii> stenno|work: mostly how I react on a onchange if it is called like this in jquery? and how I can get the ID of the second select. In the current javascript I get the name of the current and do a string replace and then use it to get by id again.
[05:54:18] <defa> need some help, this is what he complained about. He doesn't like this kind of coding. He likes pure jquery style. Can someone please show me - http://pastebin.com/ii761BW8
[05:55:07] <Cork> defa: closest is pointless when your using an id
[05:55:22] <defa> ok, how should it be written?
[05:55:30] <Cork> $('#modal')
[05:55:39] <Cork> it can only exist once anyway
[05:56:00] <defa> $('#modal').hide(); like this?
[05:56:13] <Cork> well, fadeOut
[05:56:31] <Cork> defa: what they want is prob that you use classes instead of id's
[05:56:40] <defa> ok
[05:56:40] <Cork> so the function can be more generic
[05:56:50] <Cork> this only works on one element
[05:57:01] <defa> got it
[05:57:13] <defa> so looks like the 2 lines can be removed right?
[05:57:25] <ravenzz> could this plugin have been wrote better? http://jsfiddle.net/8MDTX/
[05:57:30] <Cork> i can only guess without context
[05:57:56] <defa> $('#modal').fadeOut; $('#window_0').show();;
[05:58:28] <Cork> then way the code looks like there yes
[05:58:57] <ravenzz> I wonder how legit/safe is this var switcher = methods.switcher;
[05:59:22] <defa> ok
[06:02:21] <defa> this is not working, $('#modal').fadeOut();
[06:03:32] <DeltaHeavy> defa: What does the tag with the id of modal look like?
[06:04:03] <defa> <div id="modal">
[06:04:19] <stenno|work> and it is visible?
[06:04:32] <defa> yes
[06:04:40] <DeltaHeavy> defa: Are there any errors in your console log?
[06:05:35] <defa> my bad, i forgot to comment out the other line. It worked now :)
[06:05:59] <defa> whew :D
[06:07:07] <defa> thanks for the help folks
[06:11:03] <rosieres> how can I get a attr() value from another element ?
[06:11:21] <stenno|work> another?
[06:11:31] <stenno|work> $(myelement).attr("myattr");
[06:12:26] <MacroMan> Hi. I'm trying (unsuccesfully) to loop a JSON object. http://jsfiddle.net/j3nRC/
[06:12:51] <MacroMan> Can someone point me in the right direction please?
[06:13:22] <ajpiano> MacroMan: jQuery's each is not the same as forEach
[06:13:24] <ajpiano> the arguments are inverted
[06:13:29] <ajpiano> function(i, val) { })
[06:13:33] <rosieres> stenno|work: but I want to get the VALUE of the attribute from another element which exist elsewhere.
[06:13:33] <stenno|work> MacroMan, also you have a hash in an array
[06:13:42] <stenno|work> so the array has only one item
[06:14:04] <ajpiano> stenno|work: in different data, it might have more entries. that's clearly not the issue ;)
[06:14:27] <MacroMan> stenno|work: It will contain more later on. It's just test data atm
[06:14:31] <stenno|work> well it would explain why val has no member phoneNumber, ajpiano
[06:14:59] <ajpiano> stenno|work: nope. the problem is that the first argument in the each iterator is the index, not the value
[06:14:59] <stenno|work> eh wait, nm
[06:15:07] <MacroMan> ajpiano: How do you mean inverted?
[06:15:27] <MacroMan> Ah. SO I need function(key, val) P{
[06:15:30] <ajpiano> MacroMan: i mean that array.prototype.forEach is function( element, index ) {} and jQuery.each is function( index, element)
[06:15:30] <ajpiano> yep
[06:15:32] <ajpiano> there you go
[06:15:44] <MacroMan> Ah OK. thanks. I'll try
[06:15:53] <ravenzz> ajpiano is there something wrong in doing var switcher = methods.switcher; here http://jsfiddle.net/x5jH7/ ?
[06:16:02] <MacroMan> Got it. Working perfect, thanks
[06:16:02] <rosieres> stenno|work : in my case I want $(this) to takeover the attr value from $('#a55')
[06:16:17] <ajpiano> ravenzz: yes
[06:16:22] <stenno|work> rosieres, where is the problem?
[06:16:24] <ravenzz> ok I was almost sure
[06:16:37] <ravenzz> but what is the correct way to do the same?
[06:16:49] <stenno|work> $(this).val($("#a55").attr("value"));
[06:16:50] <ajpiano> ravenzz: when you alias a method like var foo = bar.baz; and then do foo("bam"), it invokes the method in the global scope
[06:16:55] <defa> hey folks, is this a jquery coding? $('#cancel-button1').click(function() {reset();});
[06:16:58] <ajpiano> well, in this particular case, that might not be a problem
[06:17:02] <alexfu> i'm currently using this code: http://pastebin.com/EfSYebXN to center a div vertically and horizontally, however it only works when I resize the actual window and Im not sure how to get it resize always. If i refresh the page the the left: and top: dimensions change.
[06:17:04] <stenno|work> defa, up
[06:17:06] <stenno|work> yup
[06:17:23] <ajpiano> ravenzz: is something about it not working?
[06:17:29] <ravenzz> no it works
[06:17:32] <ajpiano> oh then it's fine
[06:17:34] <ravenzz> but it sounds weird to me
[06:17:37] <defa> ok, what does reset() do?
[06:18:02] <ravenzz> I was trying to find a way to referece its object
[06:18:16] <defa> is there any documentation i can find what that reset() is for?
[06:18:36] <ravenzz> I mean how could I access particular properties in this specific case?
[06:18:36] <ajpiano> defa: are you thinking of form.reset method?
[06:19:03] <ajpiano> properties of what, in what specific case
[06:19:05] <defa> i don't know ajpiano. I just highlighted it from one of our codes
[06:19:24] <ajpiano> defa: why would you think a group of strangers on the internet would know more about your application's code base than you
[06:19:49] <ravenzz> let's say I would like to have a variable in methods and I would like to access it within the init method
[06:19:50] <ajpiano> looks like there is just a function called reset somewhere in the rest of your app that it calls, in that case
[06:20:24] <stenno|work> reset() is vanilla js for resetting forms
[06:20:31] <arikovak> I have a question regarding ui autocomplete: when using label+value combination, can I from outside event code look up the corresponding value for one of the LI?
[06:20:43] <defa> ajpiano, the code specifically reset() looks like it's a jquery function
[06:21:07] <stenno|work> <stenno|work> reset() is vanilla js for resetting forms
[06:21:07] <ajpiano> ravenzz: based on the code you've written, the only way to do it would be to write out methods.whatever
[06:21:24] <ravenzz> ok
[06:21:27] <ajpiano> stenno|work: no it isn't
[06:21:43] <ajpiano> HTMLFormElement.reset() is
[06:21:54] <ajpiano> but there's not just a global "reset" function floating around
[06:22:01] <ravenzz> but is there a better way to write it so it would be easier to access the object methods/variables ?
[06:22:12] <stenno|work> what
[06:22:23] <stenno|work> oh ajpiano i forgot the .
[06:22:35] <stenno|work> i thought that we were not talking about a global function
[06:22:35] <ravenzz> of course I don't want you to rewrite this plugin, a general example would be fine
[06:23:04] <rosieres> stenno|work: don¥t get it in my head ....  http://jsfiddle.net/VRsr9/
[06:23:09] <ajpiano> ravenzz: some sort of pattern like jqueryui widget factory or jquery boilerplate
[06:23:14] <ajpiano> where you instantiate a new object for each plugin
[06:23:25] <ajpiano> i mean, a new object for each element on which you want to have the plugin
[06:24:28] <ajpiano> ravenzz: something like this https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.prototypal-inheritance.plugin-boilerplate.js
[06:25:19] <ravenzz> so instead of looping within the init method, i should loop in here $.fn.switcher = function(){ }; and have an instance of methods for each element
[06:25:56] <ravenzz> ah ok let me see that
[06:26:46] <ajpiano> ravenzz: eaxtly
[06:26:53] <ajpiano> you create a new instance for each element
[06:27:06] <ajpiano> and then you can use data or something to give you a reference to the particular info on each element
[06:27:12] <defa> is json part of javascript?
[06:27:14] <arikovak> can I get some help with ui autocomplete, or should I be asking somewhere else?
[06:27:24] <ajpiano> also this way then you don't end up sharing data between instantiations, that you don't want to
[06:27:33] <ajpiano> defa: basically, yes.
[06:27:40] <defa> ok
[06:27:42] <defa> thanks
[06:27:52] <ajpiano> arikovak: from outside of an event?
[06:27:58] <defa> my officemate told me to study core.js
[06:28:39] <ajpiano> arikovak: provided you have a reference to the autocomplete data that you're using, it should be relatively possible
[06:28:55] <arikovak> yes, basically I'd like to know if I can mimic autocomplete's ability to map a clicked link to the value
[06:29:03] <arikovak> which I'm assuming is stored somewhere in a map
[06:29:35] <ajpiano> defa: your officemate isn't exactly doing you a service... reading the source of jquery core can be useful but first you need to know language basics
[06:29:53] <ajpiano> arikovak: so the data is static?
[06:30:14] <arikovak> no, it's from a json datasource
[06:30:38] <ajpiano> so where would you expect this "map" to be "stored"
[06:30:56] <ajpiano> arikovak: are you using source: url or source: function() { }
[06:31:05] <arikovak> I was debugging hoping to find a place where ui components store data
[06:31:16] <arikovak> source url
[06:31:20] <ravenzz> ajpiano gotcha thank you
[06:31:29] <ajpiano> arikovak: the ui components store the instance inside of .data() for the particular element
[06:31:39] <ajpiano> arikovak: but that doesn't mean there's caching built into the autocomplete by default
[06:31:45] <ajpiano> so it doesn't store the returned json anywhere
[06:32:12] <ajpiano> you'd have to roll that manually, take a look at the "Remote with caching" example on the autocomplete page
[06:32:55] <arikovak> if not stored, how can the ui component know which value to hand to the event handler when an item is clicked?
[06:33:21] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone help with this: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing On the 2nd tab (FAQ & Reviews) I have placed a PHP call in there which should echo back plain text, except the container div "ratings" is having style"display:none; " appended to the end, this is not in the actual HTML. I think it may be to do with my tab js but not sure :x
[06:33:29] <ajpiano> it gets the json back and filters the result to those matching the set and then displays it
[06:33:44] <ajpiano> it just doesn't "store" it anywher
[06:34:06] <arikovak> ok
[06:34:27] <arikovak> I'll take a look at teh example
[06:36:09] <Woet> i have two css colors
[06:36:21] <Woet> is it possible to do some math and get 100 values in between them?
[06:36:37] <Woet> one color is green, one color is red
[06:36:48] <rworth> Woet see the color plugin https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[06:37:00] <Woet> thanks
[06:37:08] <MacroMan> http://jsfiddle.net/ccmtJ/ Why does the return not end the function? I still see the second alert.
[06:38:27] <rosieres> is there something like attrFrom(); ?
[06:38:49] <rworth> MacroMan you have two nested functions. The inner return only returns the inner function. Then the code continues on to the second alert
[06:39:12] <rworth> rosieres what would that do?
[06:39:51] <rosieres> rworth sth like this http://jsfiddle.net/VRsr9/1/
[06:39:53] <stenno|work> rosieres, did my post not do what you wanted..?
[06:40:07] <rosieres> stenno|work which ?
[06:40:17] <MacroMan> rworth: Ah yes. How can I exit out of the first function as well?
[06:41:09] <stenno|work> eh nevermind, your jquery code totally confuses me
[06:41:13] <rosieres> stenno|work: did you look at the fiddle ? is sth more tricky . . .
[06:41:37] <rworth> MacroMan create a variable in the scope of the outer function. Set its value in the inner. Check after, decide whether to return early or not
[06:41:38] <rosieres> stenno|work: want not attr from this ...want attr on this from
[06:41:39] <stenno|work> it isn't at all
[06:41:48] <stenno|work> i don't get it
[06:42:01] <stenno|work> also why are you using $varname?
[06:42:04] <stenno|work> this is not php
[06:42:09] <ajpiano> ?$prefix
[06:42:16] <Woet> because dollars make you rich
[06:42:19] <ajpiano> damnit bot-t
[06:42:22] <stenno|work> ha
[06:42:38] <ajpiano> stenno|work: it's a common convention to prefix variables that reference jquery collections with $
[06:42:45] <ajpiano> you can choose to use it or not
[06:42:47] <MacroMan> rworth: OK makes sense. thanks
[06:43:21] <stenno|work> rosieres
[06:43:26] <fRAiLtY-> Why here: http://jsfiddle.net/V7Je5/3/ does any divs within the tab divs end up with style display non even if they're active?
[06:43:36] <rosieres> stenno|work: yes
[06:43:38] <fRAiLtY-> The 3 tabs with nested divs don't show, but plain text does?
[06:43:41] <stenno|work> $(this).attr("title", $repe1C.val());
[06:43:44] <mertin> hi all... quick question. I read about 'event.preventDefault' to keep an 'a href' object from it's normal behavior and doing something different
[06:43:46] <mertin> that's very interesting
[06:43:54] <mertin> is there a way to revert that behaviour?
[06:44:09] <mertin> for example after an ok/cancel dialog
[06:44:14] <stenno|work> mertin, rebind click handler
[06:44:17] <rosieres> stenno|work :thx ...perhaps i should go to bed . . .this was too bad ;-)
[06:44:29] <mertin> how do I revert the 'a href' object to its original behavior
[06:44:29] <stenno|work> hehe :)
[06:44:42] <stenno|work> set click handler to nujll
[06:45:09] <mertin> stenno|work: was that for me too?
[06:45:14] <mertin> set click handler to null?
[06:45:19] <stenno|work> yes
[06:45:34] <stenno|work> or override it with your own click handler
[06:45:42] <rworth> mertin: set a boolean variable (a flag) and use that to determine whether or not to preventDefault, then you can toggle on and off
[06:46:11] <mertin> rworth: yes, my problem is how to actually toggle off
[06:46:21] <mertin> rworth:I mean go back to default
[06:46:23] <fRAiLtY-> Why here: http://jsfiddle.net/V7Je5/3/ does any divs within the tab divs end up with style display non even if they're active?
[06:46:50] <rworth> mertin if you mean on a click that has already been prevented, no you can't. The closest you could get is to navigate to the url manually
[06:48:48] <rworth> fRAiLtY- you're showing the tab div but it has a hidden div inside of it
[06:49:07] <fRAiLtY-> Yes, but why, as that div inside isn't told to be hidden, it's "made" hidden
[06:49:24] <fRAiLtY-> It sets the div automatically to display:none
[06:49:26] <rworth> because of your quite agressive jQuery('#tabs div').hide()
[06:49:39] <rworth> change that to "#tabs > div" (in both places) and it works
[06:50:53] <fRAiLtY-> rworth:  n1, can I ask, what does the > do/tell
[06:50:58] <fRAiLtY-> <-- new to jQuery
[06:51:23] <rworth> these are not jQuery-specific, these are css selectors. " " is the descendant selector ">" is the child selector
[06:51:35] <fRAiLtY-> Ah
[06:51:37] <fRAiLtY-> gotcha
[06:51:40] <fRAiLtY-> thanks!
[06:51:40] <mertin> rworth: yes, that's what I was aiming for. To go back to default on a click that was prevented
[06:52:46] <rworth> once preventDefault is called on an event, it can't be undone
[06:53:41] <mertin> worth: that's too bad
[06:54:14] <fRAiLtY-> rworth:  Also, it seems to be inheriting a border on the div inside, it shouldn't do. The child div now has style="" which is odd, shouldn't really have that at all :x just no style=""
[06:57:22] <rworth> fRAiLtY-: check your css. Using the descendent selector, you'd told all divs within the #tabs to have a border
[06:57:54] <stenno|work> also ##javascript
[06:58:58] <fRAiLtY-> fs!
[06:59:04] <fRAiLtY-> keep getting disconnected :x
[06:59:05] <fRAiLtY-> rworth:  Also, it seems to be inheriting a border on the div inside, it shouldn't do. The child div now has style="" which is odd, shouldn't really have that at all :x just no style=""
[06:59:16] <rworth> fRAiLtY- check your css. Using the descendent selector, you'd told all divs within the #tabs to have a border
[06:59:32] <fRAiLtY-> Ok cheers
[06:59:35] <rworth> you can add the child selector there as well, but not that it is not supported in IE6
[06:59:47] <rworth> if you need to support that browser, you'll need to add a class to each of those elements
[07:00:02] <rworth> and use something like #tabs .tabcontents
[07:03:21] <rosieres> stenno|work: stenno . . . doesn¥t work .... even with directly calling the class http://jsfiddle.net/VRsr9/2/
[07:03:33] <rgr> Morning folks. I'm going around in circles with dates. In my existing system I store sql dates as datetime columns.  Typical system involving mysql, php and jquery/js. Any suggestions on how to best to handle dates. I dont mind going back and converting the columns to timestamps. Any words of wisdom welcomed at all  I just seem to spend a lot of application code converting between internal and formatted representations at both php and
[07:03:33] <rgr> jquery level (especially when you throw in ical). So I'm thinking of keeping raw timestamps and then having jquery do all the client end formatting. Any thoughts or suggestions on best approach?
[07:03:48] <ravenzz> ajpiano I am trying to play with that pattern .. http://jsfiddle.net/MDm9r/ am I doing it correctly?
[07:04:03] <Sid-G> Cork: hey, if i want to accept select elements too, will I also have to add option to the css selectors?
[07:04:34] <rworth> rgr you might want to use ISO 8601
[07:05:16] <rgr> unix timestamp is an iso standard I thought.
[07:06:36] <rgr> part of my issue is the remnants of "learn by doing" : I'm sure you understand. functions here there and everywhere calculating end dates, formatting them, dealing with durations etc. Possibly I should wipe the lot and start from scratch. Its deciding on the "best" internal in the mysql that JQuery can then deal with I think.
[07:07:55] <johnkpaul> rgr: ISO8601 is currently the best way to serialize dates as strings http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
[07:08:07] <johnkpaul> rgr: http://webcloud.se/log/JavaScript-and-ISO-8601/
[07:08:22] <rgr> I'll look at that and thanks.
[07:08:24] <johnkpaul> there's also a plugin called jquery localize that I've used to convert to human readble dates
[07:08:36] <johnkpaul> https://bitbucket.org/davidchambers/jquery.localize
[07:08:49] <Sid-G> Cork: nvm
[07:09:09] <ajpiano> ravenzz: does it work ;)
[07:09:15] <rworth> if you're parsing and formatting dates, check out Globalize or XDate or http://momentjs.com/
[07:10:04] <ravenzz> ajpiano a lot of stuffs works but aren't done properly :p
[07:10:39] <ajpiano> ravenzz: i can't really get into debugging it now, got things to do
[07:10:39] <ajpiano> sorry
[07:10:51] <rosieres> stenno|work: this way it works http://jsfiddle.net/VRsr9/6/
[07:10:54] <ravenzz> anyway I probably could get rid of the plugin builder function ($.switchPlugin) couldn't I?
[07:10:59] <ravenzz> ajpiano np
[07:12:41] <ravenzz> seems so ;)
[07:16:59] <JA123> hi
[07:17:08] <symbol> hey guys
[07:17:08] <rgr> hmm, rereading mysql it seems the mysql storage is a no brainer. Has to be DateTime. So thats that now its a question of picking best jquery/js libraries that handle that.
[07:19:17] <yango> what is a good way to chain $.ajax calls? can you do batch calls? or is it better to group them server side?
[07:19:37] <NodeX> there is somehting called promise iirc
[07:19:39] <NodeX> ?promise
[07:19:39] <yango> It seems that when I make say 10 in a row, some are lost in the way
[07:19:40] <bot-t> .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[07:20:06] <mertin> rworth: a rather nasty way to set the prevented element back to default would be to reload the page. That works. Is it too dirty?
[07:22:46] <Sid-G> Cork: u here?
[07:23:16] <Sid-G> Cork: .find iterates thru all descendants and .children iterates thru just the immediate children, right?
[07:24:05] * Sid-G asks other ppl in case Cork isn't here right now
[07:24:21] <Sid-G> anyone else?
[07:26:03] <stenno|work> Sid-G, http://api.jquery.com/find/
[07:26:37] <Sid-G> stenno|work: saw that

[07:27:07] <rosieres> how do i set a space in a selector ?
[07:27:49] <johnkpaul> rosieres: what is set a space?
[07:29:08] <xec_> Sid-G: correct
[07:29:33] <rosieres> a whitespace . . . $('.' +whatever+ 'here_i_nee_a_whitespace'};
[07:30:03] <Sid-G> xec_: k, thnx
[07:30:48] <rosieres> johnkpaul: done : $('.' +whatever+ '  here_is_my_whitespace'};
[07:31:29] <xec_> rosieres: you can't have a space in a classname
[07:31:36] <xec_> if that's what you're trying to do
[07:32:04] <rosieres> xec_ no it¥s not
[07:32:14] <raven_king> hey #jquery..I am developing this site http://greenpantry.in/test820fcec and I am using the iscroll plugin for the image slideshow in the 'our platters' section. When I load the content for this section with ajax, I get the error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of null' . On googling I find that it is because the plugin can't find the elements once they are loaded through ajax. The plugin works fine if I place the slideshow in the same ht
[07:32:15] <raven_king> ml file. Can someone tell me how I can fix this? Been struggling since afternoon...Thanks..
[07:32:33] <xec_>  rosieres: ok, what exactly are you doing then?
[07:32:34] <raven_king> sry about the long post
[07:33:04] <smdbfm> hi
[07:33:51] <xec_> raven_king: i expect you would need to initialize the plugin after the content is available (i.e. in the ajax callback after content is inserted)
[07:33:52] <rosieres> xec_: i¥ve done it already ! ->  a whitespace . . . $('.' +whatever+ ' whitespace_is_a_whitespace_and_nothing_else_because_i_need_it_for_an_a'};
[07:34:49] <xec_> rosieres: i have no idea what "it" is at the moment, you have done what?
[07:35:37] <raven_king> hi xec_ ..sry but do i initialize it in the html file that is called through ajax? is that what you mean? Thanks
[07:35:53] <rosieres> xec_ i just put a whitespace between ' and the_sentence_i_wrote
[07:36:17] <xec_> rosieres: does that mean you solved your problem?
[07:36:32] <xec_> raven_king: no. you said you loaded content via ajax, yes?
[07:36:36] <rosieres> xec_ .... yes
[07:36:43] <xec_> raven_king: ok, how do you do this
[07:36:51] <rosieres> xec_ thanks for your trouble ;-)
[07:37:10] <stribor> i am using this plugin to have tooltip in my image map..http://www.outsharked.com/scripts/jquery.imagemapster.js....i am trying to change the size of the tooltip box but cant seem to be able....can anyone help me please
[07:37:11] <raven_king> yes, I do it through a plugin again
[07:37:28] <xec_> raven_king: some plugin is doing the ajax for you?
[07:37:32] <raven_king> yes
[07:37:52] <raven_king> i link each of the list item to the html and the plugin takes care of it
[07:38:00] <xec_> raven_king: do you have any sort of control over it? does it supply a callback for when it's done?
[07:38:39] <raven_king> umm..no
[07:39:25] <raven_king> the iscroll plugin is inititiated once the dom content is loaded..if that is of any help
[07:39:33] <duellsy> I have a modal box that pops up, that needs some javascript run in it... how do i run the javascript?
[07:39:59] <defa> I was told not to use <div id="modal"></div> to create a window. I was told to use something similar to this -> $(".modal").dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, zIndex: 3000, resizable: false, height: 100 });   However, how do I put contents to it?
[07:40:36] <xec_> raven_king: i thought so, but DOM ready is before the ajax content is loaded - which i expect might be your issue
[07:41:04] <raven_king>  oh..i guess so as the plugin works fine if I simple use it in the html
[07:41:06] <stribor> anyone fam,iliar with this plugin pleasse http://www.outsharked.com/scripts/jquery.imagemapster.js
[07:41:26] <raven_king> shall i simply place the script inside each html file that is loaded?
[07:42:46] <symbol> Hey guys! I've got an issue with an $.ajax call. I'm calling an $.ajax event in an each-procedure. so i'm fireing ca.5-20 ajax-calls after each other. This $.ajax call opens an php-file which executes an bash command in the servershell (exec). The problem is that i will have an idicator for every $.ajax call. The workaround now is the $(document).ajaxStart() and $(document).ajaxStop() indication which runs the whole time until every $.ajax call
[07:42:46] <symbol>  is done. The simple logic procedure would be to show an indicating gif which gets hidden inside each "success:" parameter. How can I optimize this?
[07:43:12] <xec_> raven_king: i can't answer that without knowing the details, it could work, but unlikely

[07:55:53] <orangey> hello all. How do I bind to a particular attribute. e.g., in <input for=test class=irrelevant>, I want to bind to for=test. Currently, I'm trying "for test", but no go
[07:56:55] <defa> what's the jquery equivalent of this code -> window.open('http://www.somesite.com/');
[07:57:13] <ajpiano> inputs don't have "for" attributes... labels do
[07:57:21] <stenno|work> $(window).open("http://somesite.com") // guess
[07:57:25] <ajpiano> $("[for='test']")
[07:57:33] <ajpiano> stenno|work: defa see ?jsisjs
[07:57:34] <bot-t> stenno|work, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[07:58:05] <defa> ok

[08:03:33] <symbol> stenno|work, you know somebody in this channel who could help me with this? i don't know who's who
[08:05:07] <stenno|work> no, if they can help you, they say it
[08:05:14] <stenno|work> if they cannot, they don't...
[08:05:29] <symbol> mh k thx
[08:08:36] <batterhead> So, I'm checking out the docs to see how to properly use .on('hover'...) and in the notes it suggests to NOT do this but instead use mousenter and mouseleave. Would I bind those event handlers together or seperately?
[08:09:04] <batterhead> since I want to trigger a different function for each of those events
[08:09:15] <ajpiano> batterhead: you'd do it separately if you want separate func
[08:09:22] <batterhead> word
[08:09:22] <caniuse> batterhead: bond
[08:09:47] <smplstk> word is bond, it's true :S
[08:09:56] <garbagegod> Can I use $(document).ready(function() in a script not inside <head>?
[08:10:03] <garbagegod> I'm trying to use this script but it gives me a blank page
[08:10:13] <stenno|work> garbagegod, sure
[08:10:30] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/tmT2msTt
[08:10:35] <garbagegod> Anything wrong with that?
[08:12:53] <engaged> i have a button where i do a .click() on for the form and validate the info... and if it's good i do a form.submit()... however this doesn't work if i hit "enter" on the form... how do i get that to work?
[08:13:05] <garbagegod> oh, fixed it
[08:17:12] <stribor> anyone used image mapster plugin
[08:17:54] <garbagegod> How do I repeat a function multiple times?
[08:18:07] <garbagegod> Like, execute a function, once it's done executing execute it again
[08:18:14] <Woet> what are you trying to do?
[08:18:58] <thinkt4nk> if you're trying to recurse within an anonymous function, use arguments.callee
[08:19:06] <garbagegod> I have an animate function for a sliding banner, it comes in from the right and slides over to the left and off the page, and then I want to reset the sliders position to the right side and have it animate to the left again constantly
[08:19:44] <Woet> garbagegod: you generally have a callback and you put the function in there
[08:20:10] <Woet> function showBanner(){ $("#banner").show('slide', function(){ showBanner(); });
[08:20:12] <Woet> function showBanner(){ $("#banner").show('slide', function(){ showBanner(); }); }
[08:20:13] <Woet> like that
[08:20:20] <defa> hey folks, I can't make the titlebar disappear, http://pastebin.com/ft1wXKu4
[08:20:45] <Woet> defa: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1023072/jquery-ui-dialog-how-to-initialize-without-a-title-bar
[08:21:06] <defa> thanks a lot. How did you find it so quick?
[08:21:19] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around per chance?
[08:22:17] <symbol> Woet, is it possible to handle multiple $.ajax loading-indicators ?
[08:22:40] <garbagegod> So wait, I have a function called showbanner(); how do I use it's callback to call itself and reset the css property of the slder?
[08:23:14] <thinkt4nk> arguments.callee
[08:23:51] <ajpiano> if it's name,d just call showbanner() again inside itself
[08:23:55] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: hat's upi
[08:24:25] <jetienne> body.appendChild() <- i want to prepend, what is the name of the method to do that ?
[08:24:29] <thinkt4nk> and if it's not named, use arguments.callee lol
[08:25:00] <ajpiano> jetienne: in jquery, you'd use $(document.body).prepend("stuff")
[08:25:05] <ajpiano> jetienne: there is no "prepend" in native DOM
[08:25:29] <ajpiano> you'd have to insertBefore the first child in the doc
[08:25:32] <jetienne> ajpiano: what is the closest in DOM ?
[08:25:35] <jetienne> ah ok thanks
[08:25:44] <defa> so jquery doesn't have built-in option to disable titlebar?
[08:27:29] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano:  having a bit of trouble, but I have to fix something else that popped up first
[08:27:31] <jeffsmykil> joy
[08:29:01] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/mW7JSSrV can you guys tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[08:29:11] <Xotix> is basic ajax http authentification restricted by ajax?
[08:29:16] <Xotix> i mean same origin policy?
[08:29:31] <Xotix> cross domain :)
[08:30:01] <stribor> anyone familiar with image mapster
[08:30:21] <Xotix> e.g. http://pastebin.com/URGWSTgM
[08:30:22] <garbagegod> the callback definitely isn't working
[08:31:51] <garbagegod> I suspect this is syntax related?
[08:34:11] <quicksilver> garbagegod: you're giving showbanner one parameter but not using it?
[08:34:41] <garbagegod> What do you mean? Sorry, I'm a n00b
[08:34:42] <defa> ok folks, I got it working. Titlebar is gone, WOOHOO. However, when I click my close button, it hides it but there is a 4 pixel line that remains. Looks like it only minimized. What's wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/NkwcTGjS
[08:35:04] <garbagegod> I have to pass the callback to showbanner() like showbanner(callback) and then inside showbanner() I have to call the callback correct?
[08:35:06] <quicksilver> garbagegod: function showbanner() { ... } defines a function showbanner which ignores any parameters you pass it.
[08:35:23] <quicksilver> garbagegod: you then call it with one parameter (a callback as you correctly say).
[08:35:28] <quicksilver> that parameter is being ignored.
[08:35:29] <garbagegod> quicksilver: I changed it to showbanner(callback)
[08:35:35] <quicksilver> ok that's progress.
[08:35:36] <studio_> function showbanner(cb){./
[08:35:38] <quicksilver> now actually use it :)
[08:35:48] <quicksilver> pass it to animate as animate's 3rd parameter
[08:35:52] <quicksilver> is what I presume you want.
[08:35:52] <garbagegod> right so, how do I execute the callback function from inside showbanner()?
[08:36:08] <garbagegod> ah okay
[08:36:10] <garbagegod> let me try that
[08:36:12] <studio_> just use the same name as you define inside the function parathesis
[08:36:46] <studio_> parenthesis rather
[08:37:03] <stribor> guys how do you inspect propery of  tooltips using firebug when you can really right click on the tooltip since it dispears every time i mouse out
[08:38:48] <quicksilver> stribor: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7238988 perhaps
[08:39:28] <symbol> quicksilver,  can you help me regarding $.ajax callbacks?
[08:40:08] <quicksilver> symbol: if you have a question just ask it
[08:40:21] <quicksilver> no point addressing particular people you don't know.
[08:40:35] <johnkpaul> ?ask @symbol
[08:40:36] <bot-t> symbol, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:41:18] <symbol> i did :-/ but it's just a little complicated and based on more than 1 question.
[08:41:28] <lathan> we can help....
[08:42:07] <johnkpaul> symbol: then think a little more and try to separate them out
[08:42:11] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to do?
[08:42:14] <lathan> ?livedemo
[08:42:15] <bot-t> Please create a working demo of your problem on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net. Please include the JS and CSS dependencies so we can see what you're talking about. Note: the script panes do not need script tags, or $(document).ready's, that is automatic
[08:42:51] <johnkpaul> ooo, there's livedemo now?
[08:42:56] <johnkpaul> or was that always there?
[08:43:00] <johnkpaul> demo, livedemo, jsfiddle
[08:43:02] <garbagegod> Okay, so here's my code now: http://pastebin.com/7URdMmFn how do I get the function I have in onload to recurse so it keeps scrolling from rtl?
[08:43:17] <lathan> johnkpaul, I think I made it several years ago...then it was refined
[08:43:52] <stribor> quicksilver: I AM JUST TRYING TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF TOOLTIP BOX AND CANT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO:)
[08:44:03] <johnkpaul> yes stribor, caps really helps
[08:44:12] <symbol> i'm calling multiple $.ajax calls and want to get an loading indicator for each one.
[08:44:32] <lathan> garbagegod, why are you using animate to change left, then calling a callback to update it? why not keep using animate?
[08:44:39] <lathan> ?lol
[08:44:40] <bot-t> function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[08:45:03] <lathan> success or complete handler @symbol
[08:45:13] <symbol> the "success:" parameter is fired before the script (url:) is ready
[08:45:19] <johnkpaul> symbol: ok, so in each ajax call  you start a loading indicator before it is made and then in the complete callback, you stop it
[08:45:39] <garbagegod> lathan: well, the point is to animate it from right to left, then reset it back to the right and animate it again and continue like that indefinitely
[08:45:41] <johnkpaul> symbol: what do you mean, are you using getScript?
[08:45:57] <stribor> jOH
[08:45:58] <defa> figured it out, it is called like this -> $('.welcomebox').dialog("close");
[08:46:07] <garbagegod> At this point all I need is a way to repeat a function forever without freezing stuff :P
[08:46:17] <stribor> johnkpaul: so sorry it want intentional..apologizy
[08:46:18] <symbol> i will prepare a pastebin.
[08:46:49] <lathan> garbagegod, so you are using the animate in order to keep it from locking up?
[08:46:59] <garbagegod> lathan: I suppose so
[08:47:14] <defa> is fadeout implemented in dialog? It's because this doesn't work, $('.welcomebox').dialog("fadeOut");
[08:47:23] <lathan> garbagegod, first thought I have is to make lines 13-17 into a named function, then you can call that name at the end in order to restart the loop
[08:47:32] <garbagegod> I just want the function I have in onload to repeat iself infinitely
[08:47:39] <garbagegod> once it's done executing etc
[08:47:55] <garbagegod> yeah, then how do I call that function infinitely?
[08:48:03] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn setinterval @ garbagegod
[08:48:04] <bot-t> garbagegod, window.setInterval - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval
[08:48:26] <quicksilver> or you could just stuff it at the end of its own callback
[08:48:43] <quicksilver> there seems no value having the callback defined specially and used as a parameter
[08:48:57] <quicksilver> you might as well just hardcode it as an anon function inside showbanner()
[08:49:04] <quicksilver> which could them call itself at the end.
[08:49:23] <quicksilver> (by the way there are some quite good jQuery scroller plugins which do what you're doing in a very configurable way ;)
[08:49:43] <garbagegod> such as?
[08:50:05] <quicksilver> garbagegod: we use this one : http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/
[08:50:06] <defa> i got it working but the fading out is crap,  $('.welcomebox').dialog({ hide: "fadeOut" });
[08:50:12] <symbol> http://pastebin.com/MGVx43Sf
[08:50:14] <defa> it's different when a div fades out

[08:50:34] <garbagegod> whoa, that IS smooth
[08:50:36] <garbagegod> thanks quicksilver
[08:50:56] <symbol> this is the process which calls a $.ajax for each td in table2.
[08:51:47] <defa> lathan, fade isn't mentioned on that link
[08:51:48] <johnkpaul> symbol: so for every single ajax call there is only _1_ loading indicator?
[08:51:59] <johnkpaul> i thought you meant that there was one loading indicator per ajax call
[08:52:00] <lathan> symb, right inside the each: $(this).html('<img src="/img/loading.gif" />')
[08:52:08] <lathan> defa, wasn't sending that to you...just looking it up myself
[08:52:11] <Xotix> I want to make an ajax get request cross domain. I've enabled Access-Control-Allow-Origin * but doing a most simple $.ajax with get doesn't work because of the same origin policy. What i'm doing wrong?
[08:52:19] <lathan> defa, but I think it has access to any effect in jQuery.fx
[08:52:26] <johnkpaul> Xotix: what browser?
[08:52:59] <Xotix> johnkpaul: chrome. 18. It should work, i know i've done stuff before with cors.
[08:53:04] <defa> ok
[08:53:34] <johnkpaul> hm, are you sure the problem is SOP, Xotix? what's the error msg in the error handler parameters
[08:54:05] <Pupeno_W> I have a form that uses ajax and replaces itself when there are errors. When I put it in a jquery ui dialog it closes the dialog. Any ideas how to prevent that?
[08:55:51] <defa> lathan, this is how my fading out is working. The window box shrinks to upper left corner. What i realy like is fading
[08:57:01] <Xotix> johnkpaul what parameter exactly? the browser gives me XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://img.pascal.xiag.ch/. Origin http://demo.pascal.xiag.ch/ is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[08:58:27] <johnkpaul> hmm, Xotix, I don't know, if you have the right headers, it should be fine
[08:58:38] <johnkpaul> I don't believe there is anything special that you need to do with jQuery to make it work
[08:58:42] <johnkpaul> ?demo @Xotix
[08:58:42] <bot-t> Xotix, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:59:58] <Xotix> johnkpaul can't createa live demo, it is locally. But there is nothing special about it. http://pastie.org/3910521 that gets aboarded and doesn't receive any response.

[09:03:43] <symbol> ok i think there is a logic problem. I sure have a indicator for every $.ajax call.  There is a <div> element in every "#table2 td" - but with the same name. I thought it will relate to the (in this moment) active "td" .  I think i missed the $(this) aspect.
[09:03:45] <johnkpaul> oh, if you need basic auth, you _do_ need to add something to jquery, Xotix
[09:03:49] <johnkpaul> you need to add withCredentials
[09:03:55] <johnkpaul> ?ajax @Xotix
[09:03:55] <bot-t> Xotix, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:04:02] <johnkpaul> look in the docs for that config option
[09:04:45] <Xotix> johnkpaul of course, but i thought it was on page x and i didn't call page x. So i thought the authantification isn't necessary here. I've tried to isolate the problem. thanks
[09:04:47] <stribor> after changing js that is included property of element didnt changed even after i cleared the cache.....is there anything else i might be missing
[09:04:55] <johnkpaul> Xotix: oh ok, sure, no problem
[09:06:27] <SmashingX> Can somebody please help me with this error? I have pasted my code here: http://pastebin.com/gSLY4jQg and the error description is in the last line
[09:07:17] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: try putting brackets around the if and else statements
[09:07:18] <symbol> what would be the selector to select the div in the td which is active (in the each part)?
[09:10:35] <symbol> ?selector
[09:10:36] <bot-t> symbol, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[09:10:46] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: same error :(
[09:11:28] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: you meant this right? http://pastebin.com/Q8wsgcB9
[09:12:49] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: you have a whitespace character after the semicolon
[09:13:50] <SmashingX> no whitespace
[09:15:52] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: <200b>
[09:16:03] <johnkpaul> I don't know what that means exactly, but it's the character that shows up in VIM
[09:16:20] <johnkpaul> put your cursor after the semicolon and backspace once
[09:16:41] <vinceableworld> GM: What's the best file upload implementation out there?
[09:16:59] <johnkpaul> vinceableworld: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[09:17:03] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: I did that already, but it didn't change anything
[09:17:10] <vinceableworld> Yup been researching that.
[09:17:16] <SmashingX> I was wondering if my error has to do with this: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/illegal-character
[09:17:29] <vinceableworld> I'm having a hell of a time - jquery newbie here.
[09:17:33] <SmashingX> I should change the single quotes
[09:17:39] <SmashingX> probably?
[09:17:41] <raven_king> sry got disconnected..did anyone answer my question?
[09:17:51] <johnkpaul> ?learn @vinceableworld
[09:17:52] <bot-t> vinceableworld, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:18:02] <SmashingX> but I was wondering which ones can be changed
[09:18:08] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: it's definitely that character
[09:18:14] <vinceableworld> I have a basic understanding of javascript
[09:18:24] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: which one are you talking about?
[09:18:45] <vinceableworld> i'm an 8+ yr php vet - I got the basic syntax down
[09:18:51] <johnkpaul> vinceableworld: yeah, I did that for the jqfundamentals link
[09:18:58] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: the character after the last smiolon
[09:19:01] <johnkpaul> semicolon
[09:19:22] <vinceableworld> Working on learning more :)
[09:19:30] <SmashingX> could you please paste the code with that character removed?
[09:19:42] <SmashingX> because I already did and I think it's the same
[09:20:07] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: http://pastebin.com/FinXz0qM
[09:20:17] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: thanks
[09:20:45] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: no problem
[09:20:49] <johnkpaul> what text editor do you use, SmashingX?
[09:20:53] <johnkpaul> it should have pointed that out to you
[09:20:57] <SmashingX> pluma
[09:21:42] <raven_king> really sorry..reposting cos i got disconnected...can someone look at the 'our platters' section in this site: http://greenpantry.in/test820fcec and suggest a good plugin that i can use implement the tabs functionality? most of what I find looks old..
[09:23:12] <SmashingX> mhhh... I don't know if is related but now is pointing to another direction with the same error
[09:23:13] <vinceableworld> john do you have a working model of this file uploader?
[09:23:42] <SmashingX> let me find out
[09:23:44] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: you probably have this odd character in many places
[09:24:00] <johnkpaul> vinceableworld: not somewhere easily publicaly accesible
[09:24:04] <johnkpaul> do you have a queston about it?, vinceableworld
[09:24:12] <vinceableworld> I need to grab the file - and then change the filename based on the location of the user (state county district etc)
[09:24:16] <SmashingX> Im taking out the function from the code to see if that's still the problem
[09:24:48] <SmashingX> yeah no
[09:24:49] <vinceableworld> In this "do nothing.htm" part - can that be the php file that handles my upload?
[09:24:55] <SmashingX> it's definetly that part of the code
[09:25:02] <SmashingX> now it's working without errors
[09:25:08] <vinceableworld> I've finally after three days at least go it saying "error"
[09:25:19] <SmashingX> damn, I don't understand this thing:(
[09:25:25] <johnkpaul> ?helpfulhelp @vinceableworld
[09:25:26] <bot-t> vinceableworld, http://guipn.com/blog/how-to-get-helpful-help/
[09:25:28] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: get a better text editor
[09:25:32] <johnkpaul> that will show you these characters
[09:25:34] <SmashingX> like?
[09:25:38] <vinceableworld> Also - been dealing with multiple versions - multiple implementations.
[09:25:42] <johnkpaul> what os do you use, SmashingX?
[09:25:50] <SmashingX> LMDE
[09:25:52] <SmashingX> Linux
[09:26:03] <defa> i don't like the register interface that my officemate made :( He used dialog box with scrollbar
[09:26:18] <vinceableworld> thx for the link.
[09:26:26] <johnkpaul> what is pluma SmashingX?
[09:26:35] <johnkpaul> perhaps vim, or perhaps eclipse, it depends on what kind of editor you like
[09:27:15] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: do you know gedit?
[09:27:29] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: yes, the equivalent of windows notepad, no?
[09:27:36] <SmashingX> yes
[09:27:43] <SmashingX> that's similar
[09:27:51] <SmashingX> but pluma is for MATE
[09:28:02] <SmashingX> gedit is for gnome
[09:28:09] <garbagegod> Does this divsmoothscroll shit work on an absolutely positioned div?
[09:28:19] <johnkpaul> oh I see, then IMHO, SmashingX, you need to invest some time in a better text editing experience
[09:29:57] <garbagegod> I can not get this divsmoothscroller thing to work..
[09:30:26] <jeebster> divsmoothscroll‚Ä¶is that an anchor jump/scroll plugin?
[09:30:50] <jeebster> paralax eh
[09:32:34] <defa> hey folks, how do I change jquery's dialog window so that corners are not rounded?
[09:32:58] <Xotix> johnkpaul: but for using withCredentials i need to add additional headers right?
[09:33:21] <johnkpaul> Xotix: yes
[09:33:22] <johnkpaul> http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/
[09:33:28] <johnkpaul> that describes it
[09:34:49] <Xotix> johnkpaul: got it thanks a lot. does thsi work in ie8,9?
[09:35:12] <johnkpaul> hm, with http auth might be just ie 9
[09:35:17] <johnkpaul> but w/o is ie8+
[09:35:18] <johnkpaul> and no opera
[09:35:30] <Xotix> w/o?
[09:35:56] <johnkpaul> without
[09:36:07] <johnkpaul> I don't think IE8 can use http auth for xdomain requests
[09:36:39] <Xotix> but ie8 knows cors and xmlhttprequest for get requests. afaik
[09:39:04] <garbagegod> I think I'm giving up on this divsmoothscroll thing, it kinda sucks
[09:39:08] <johnkpaul> Xotix: yes, but not with basic http auth
[09:40:23] <garbagegod> What's the best / easiest way to scroll an image from right to left on a page?
[09:40:36] <Xotix> johnkpaul: and if i open the link within an iframe?
[09:40:51] <johnkpaul> Xotix: open the link?
[09:41:20] <Xotix> just add an iframe with src="pathToThe Page WithTheAuth"
[09:42:25] <garbagegod> Anyone?
[09:42:35] <diamonds> how do I instantiate a new jQuery?
[09:42:43] <diamonds> I'm trying to test if .html() is called in a function
[09:42:53] <diamonds> so I spy on $.fn.html (using jasmine)'
[09:43:00] <diamonds> but i don't want to screw up jquery globally
[09:43:05] <johnkpaul> ?sub @diamonds
[09:43:09] <diamonds> so I thought "make a new jquery and spy on it"
[09:43:15] <diamonds> !sub
[09:43:19] <diamonds> ?
[09:43:28] <johnkpaul> diamonds: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[09:43:42] <diamonds> hawt
[09:44:51] <diamonds> OK actually I need to call $ in the function being tested
[09:45:12] <johnkpaul> diamonds: if you're unit testing, just overwrite what you need to with stubs/spys
[09:45:21] <diamonds> can i mock$ = $.sub(); /*spy on $.fn.html; do my test*/ $ = mock$; ?
[09:45:40] <johnkpaul> diamonds: are you using sinon?
[09:45:42] <johnkpaul> sinon has that OOTB
[09:45:57] <diamonds> johnkpaul: yes, I'm just concerned that if I spy on $.fn.html, since it's in the global space, it will STAY spied upon
[09:46:12] <diamonds> johnkpaul: no, jasmine spys have done what I need thusfar
[09:46:30] <diamonds> I have had sinon recommended but didn't see features I needed right away
[09:46:36] <johnkpaul> diamonds: I don't know jasmine very well, but sinon has something that will override in the setup and then put everything back in the teardown
[09:46:43] <johnkpaul> so you don't have to worry about explcitly saving and assigningback
[09:46:58] <Xotix> thx again
[09:48:14] <johnkpaul> diamonds: http://sinonjs.org/docs/#stubs
[09:48:24] <johnkpaul> look at the third method signature
[09:50:04] <diamonds> johnkpaul-afk: ah... jasmine appears to scope spying to the test
[09:50:21] <diamonds> so it's OK, it doesn't overwrite $.fn.html globally, or it fixes it
[09:56:47] <SmashingX> johnkpaul: I was deleting one instruction by one to get the one that is causeing the problem and I got this: http://pastebin.com/2tPpXQxY
[09:56:57] <SmashingX> johnkpaulI can't get rid of the error :(
[10:01:37] <BillCriswell> SmashingX: You seem to have an if there that does absolutely nothing.
[10:01:53] <SmashingX> I know that
[10:02:11] <SmashingX> I got rid of the content of the if to see where the error is
[10:02:34] <SmashingX> apparently the error is when I want to close the if
[10:02:52] <SmashingX> Im sorry, when I want to close the function
[10:03:07] <garbagegod> Guys, I'm confused, my code just straight up isn't working
[10:03:19] <BillCriswell> SmashingX: http://pastie.org/pastes/3910833/text
[10:03:34] <BillCriswell> garbagegod: We need more detail than that.
[10:03:41] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/bHdkqQSA
[10:03:44] <garbagegod> Dosen't do anything
[10:03:47] <garbagegod> No alert
[10:03:50] <BillCriswell> Does it give you an error?
[10:03:50] <garbagegod> It's in the source though
[10:04:15] <BillCriswell> garbagegod: My gut tells me you didn't include jquery.
[10:04:37] <garbagegod> that one dosen't
[10:04:46] <garbagegod> I thought alert was supported by plain jane JS?
[10:04:53] <garbagegod> and pretty sure I did...
[10:05:03] <BillCriswell> It is. The $(document).ready(function(){ }); is jquery though.
[10:05:44] <garbagegod> oh jeez, I guess that *was* my problem
[10:05:52] <garbagegod> even though I had like 10 jquery libraries loaded...
[10:05:58] <SmashingX> BillCriswell: Apparently that fixed the error what did you do? now im scared to add the content of the if and break everything again
[10:06:22] <BillCriswell> If you don't have anything in that if you can just remove all that code.
[10:06:41] <SmashingX> I need to add code inside the if
[10:06:50] <BillCriswell> Then add it. =)
[10:07:03] <SmashingX> also I need to add and else
[10:07:37] <BillCriswell> Add it in. If you have an error after you do that paste the whole sourc somewhere and we can help out.
[10:07:56] <BillCriswell> garbagegod: It's almost always the person using jquery's fault.
[10:09:54] <garbagegod> BillCriswell: well duh, computers never make mistakes *ever*
[10:10:02] <garbagegod> The people who program them do
[10:11:02] <BillCriswell> garbagegod: Yeah but jQuery is put through thorough testing. I said jquery, not the computer.
[10:11:08] <greedo> I have a .load(), how can I make it take in json data?
[10:11:38] <BillCriswell> greedo: The second parameter.
[10:11:41] <poppiez> how do you avoid showing the iphone navigation bar when clicking a link with a hashbang?
[10:12:18] <garbagegod> BillCriswell: I wasn't in any way implying it wasn't my own stupidity :)
[10:12:59] <BillCriswell> poppiez: It should scroll down automatically and hide the chrome? At least.. I always thought that.
[10:13:03] <greedo> BillCriswell: I thought that was just for passing data to the server, I want to ingest json encoded data from a script
[10:13:57] <SmashingX> omg, now I don't have the error but is not doing what I want it to do :(
[10:15:16] <poppiez> BillCriswell: found a fix: http://blog.josemanuelperez.es/2011/06/prevent-iphone-navigation-bar-ajax-link-click/
[10:15:51] <lathan> greedo, ?getJSON
[10:15:57] <lathan> ?getJSON @ greedo
[10:16:20] <lathan> great...the bot is off again
[10:16:40] <greedo> lathan: got it thanks
[10:16:49] <BillCriswell> greedo: Not sure I'm following what you're trying to do.  You have load() and you want to pass it json data?
[10:16:55] <SmashingX> I get now this error queue[i] is undefined
[10:16:56] <rapha> Hi!
[10:17:41] <BillCriswell> .load('goo.php', { data: { "foo": "bar" }}); ?
[10:18:01] <BillCriswell> SmashingX: Would need more information to help out.
[10:18:01] <greedo> BillCriswell: I'm to partial load json data into a page
[10:18:38] <BillCriswell> You're getting json data from the requested page?
[10:18:48] <greedo> I may be approaching this the wrong way
[10:19:11] <digitalcakestudi> any one had a good recourse for how to make simple pop animation "not a pop up but more like how a talk bubble would pop and bounce a little bit from a small scale to a full scale. "
[10:19:21] <BillCriswell> Someone pointer out getJSON which sounds like what you may need.
[10:19:25] <BillCriswell> pointed*
[10:20:03] <greedo> BillCriswell: basically I have some graphs that cause the entire page to load slow, so I'm going to load each seperately
[10:20:20] <rapha> I'd like to load the href of a link into a SimpleModal box when that link is clicked. Can somebody help me with how that could work?
[10:20:33] <eddiemonge> greedo: you dont need getJSON for that
[10:20:51] <greedo> eddiemonge: ok, what do I need?
[10:21:10] <eddiemonge> greedo: .get("url", data, callback, "json") will load the returned data as json in the callback automatically
[10:21:36] <eddiemonge> rapha:  have you looked at jqueryui's dialog? has that functionality built in
[10:21:57] <SmashingX> BillCriswell: this is what I have now: http://pastebin.com/XeLFqZFS the top part is the code I modified and on the bottom part is the file that it's pointing to in the line 27 (I didn't write that code)
[10:22:00] <rapha> eddiemonge: no, I didn't know that existed. I'll check it out!
[10:23:00] <BillCriswell> SmashingX: Are you sure there's a checkbox with that id?
[10:23:10] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  what version of jquery are you using?
[10:23:15] <rapha> eddiemonge: looks nice and I'd like not having to have an extra library. But how does that feature work, the docs don't seem to mention it?
[10:23:42] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Isn't that pretty close to just using getJSON?
[10:23:44] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I finally got that code I was working on during my own time writing modes sucessfully
[10:23:44] <SmashingX> 1.2.6
[10:24:13] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: getJSON is unnecessary if you are already doing a jQuery ajax call and the returned data is JSON
[10:24:17] <greedo> BillCriswell eddiemonge: thank guys, I believe I understand now
[10:24:28] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  wow, really? why? thats like 4 years old
[10:24:31] <lathan_away> $.getJSON is just $.ajax({ method: 'get', datatype: 'JSON', success: function(){...} })
[10:24:50] <SmashingX> eddiemonge: that's what Im using
[10:24:59] <BillCriswell> lathan_away: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[10:25:33] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  literally 4 years old in 10 days: May 24, 2008. may be time to upgrade
[10:25:52] <SmashingX> eddiemonge: yeah but no now, I need to fix this error first
[10:25:53] <SirCmpwn> I'm using animate() on a div with a background image to change the opacity, and it's only fading out; it won't fade in
[10:26:00] <SirCmpwn> it goes straight to full opacity
[10:26:19] <SirCmpwn> live demo: http://me.drewdevault.com (hover over "developer tools")
[10:26:29] <eddiemonge> SmashingX: im dont understand what the second part of your code has to do with the first
[10:26:39] <BillCriswell> SmashingX: Are you sure those checkboxes exist?
[10:26:59] <lathan> eddiemonge, by specifying the JSON type, you don't rely on the server's mimetype being set correctly.
[10:27:13] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell:  sorry yeah, was spacing there. thought it said parseJSON, not getJSON
[10:27:17] <rapha> eddiemonge: you sure it is something built into jQuery UI Dialog and not something that needs to be achieved by combining it with some other technique? I really can't find anything about it in the docs...
[10:27:33] <SmashingX> let me copy the code with the checkboxes
[10:27:43] <SirCmpwn> oh, fixed it, opacity is 0-1, not 0-100
[10:29:03] <SmashingX> yes, although I think they are in a different form than the radiobuttons
[10:29:15] <SmashingX> Probably that's why they are not doing what they are suppose to do
[10:30:16] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  a live example on jsfiddle would be nice
[10:30:41] <SmashingX> I have this one: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/30/#run
[10:30:50] <lathan_away> ?livedemo @ eddiemonge, SmashingX
[10:30:57] <lathan_away> arg....bot-t is offline
[10:31:36] <eddiemonge> which is why i didnt try that
[10:31:52] <lathan_away> I just like using it soo much...
[10:32:00] * lathan_away is addicted to bot-t
[10:32:06] <eddiemonge> SmashingX: what doesnt work on that?
[10:32:18] <eddiemonge> lathan_away: me too. me too. ive missed bot-t the most
[10:32:30] <SmashingX> eddiemonge: It works but not on my site
[10:32:53] <SirCmpwn> why do you think the <ul> disappears when the animation completes? http://me.drewdevault.com
[10:32:57] <SmashingX> I just put that as an example
[10:33:11] <eddiemonge> rapha:  a bit old but still works: http://jsbin.com/uxuha/edit#javascript,html
[10:33:19] <SmashingX> but as I was saying I think the problem is that the radiobuttons are in the form id=Main
[10:33:25] <SmashingX> and the checkboxes are in another form
[10:33:28] <eddiemonge> SirCmpwn:  you should chain some of your methods
[10:33:40] <SirCmpwn> eddiemonge: such as?
[10:34:18] <eddiemonge> SirCmpwn:  $(this).addClass("one").fadeIn().animate(....
[10:34:25] <SirCmpwn> ah
[10:34:48] <eddiemonge> doing $(this).addClass("one"); $(this).fadeIn(); $(this).animate(); is really bad for performance. at the least, cache your selectors
[10:34:49] <SirCmpwn> chained those, thanks for pointing it out
[10:35:39] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  got a live link to your site?
[10:35:50] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  its not that code thats failing, its something else on your site
[10:35:59] <SmashingX> eddiemonge:  no
[10:38:06] <eddiemonge> SmashingX: i would step through that code and see whats causing it to fail
[10:38:28] <SirCmpwn> eddiemonge: any thoughts on my ul disappearing?
[10:39:46] <mertin> million dollar question: is there a way to disable status bar url?
[10:39:55] <mertin> can't find anything online
[10:40:01] <mertin> I mean nothing definitive
[10:40:10] <SirCmpwn> eddiemonge: works fine if I only animate to 0.999 opacity, so I'll do that instead
[10:42:12] <eddiemonge> mertin: no. why would you want?
[10:42:36] <mertin> I've seen that reply a lot
[10:42:36] <mertin> hehe
[10:42:44] <johnkpaul> mertin: you can open a new window w/o one

[10:43:01] <mertin> eddiemonge: to prevent a user from accesing an url
[10:43:18] <eddiemonge> SirCmpwn: no idea but this should be better for you http://jsbin.com/ahejil/edit#javascript
[10:43:23] <guile> Hi everybody.
[10:43:26] <SirCmpwn> eddiemonge: ty
[10:43:35] <mertin> eddiemonge: the idea is that I force a license on the user that if he doesn't agree to it, he can't download stuff from my website
[10:43:41] <eddiemonge> mertin:  to prevent a user from accessing a url? what do you mean?
[10:43:46] <jeffsmykil> Im starting to dislike _setOption
[10:44:05] <eddiemonge> mertin:  i dont see the connection there.
[10:44:16] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil:  say what?
[10:44:40] <guile> I'm new with jquery, just starting reading documentation and doing some examples and I have a doubt: I want to know how google plus uses the browser scrollbar for scrolling just an area.
[10:44:58] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: in widget factory
[10:45:10] <johnkpaul> guile: something like this? http://joelb.me/scrollpath/
[10:45:26] <guile> johnkpaul: Let me see...
[10:45:39] <rapha> eddiemonge: ah but that uses a hardcoded url where it gets the content from. i want to use the html from the link's own href. but it's still helpful and I think I'm going to get it put together!
[10:46:05] <SmashingX> here is my error: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/34/
[10:46:10] <guile> johnkpaul: YES!!! Amazing!!! thank you very much.
[10:46:18] <jeffsmykil> I don't understand why setOption only lets you do a key and a value
[10:46:27] <jeffsmykil> I have heard about setOptions but cant find any good docs
[10:46:28] <mertin> eddiemonge: Site with URLs, and a license. If the user doesn't agree to the license, I don't want him to be able to download the struff from the URLs, and even if I disable the 'a' elements from being clicked, he can still put the mouse over and *see* the URL and just write it down
[10:46:32] <johnkpaul> guile: no problem, have fun
[10:46:34] <SmashingX> when I select any of the checkboxes is not changing the selection to the $0 radiobutton
[10:46:38] <eddiemonge> rapha:  you dont have to hardcode the url
[10:46:58] <eddiemonge> mertin:  do you have a backend managing that?
[10:47:00] <guile> Bye bye.
[10:47:07] <mertin> eddiemonge: right now I'm 'hiding' the 'a' elements but I don't like how that looks
[10:47:15] <eddiemonge> mertin:  because if its just frontend, then you can still just view source
[10:47:27] <mertin> eddiemonge: I don't even know what a backend is :$
[10:47:33] <mertin> oh, yes
[10:47:46] <mertin> I understand
[10:47:53] <eddiemonge> SmashingX:  its hard to troubleshoot your issue without the actual site where its failing since the code you put is working
[10:48:24] <mertin> eddiemonge: you're right, but this is not hi-tech security, it's just for users to be discouraged
[10:48:34] <SmashingX> eddiemonge: the code in fiddle is not working
[10:48:38] <eddiemonge> mertin:  backend: stuff you dont see, usually done in php, perl, python, nodejs, etc. frontend: stuff the end user sees and intereacts with
[10:48:44] <mertin> those savvy enough to view the source code can get away with it :)
[10:48:47] <hayer> How can I select "$(this) > ul" ?
[10:48:55] <johnkpaul> ?find @hayer
[10:48:56] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[10:49:08] <eddiemonge> mertin:  then dont make the link a link. just do an onclick event that downloads the file
[10:49:12] <johnkpaul> or actually, that's just children
[10:49:15] <mertin> eddiemonge: yes I had the backend out of context, now I understand what you meant by it
[10:49:15] <johnkpaul> ?children @hayer
[10:49:16] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[10:50:15] <hayer> johnkpaul: thanks :)
[10:50:22] <hayer> got it working with find
[10:50:54] <eddiemonge> hayer:  if you want > ul then children is better: $(this).children("ul")
[10:50:55] <mertin> eddiemonge: I prefer not to touch the backend, and leave the link as it is....
[10:51:05] <eddiemonge> otherwise find will find all ul that are descendants of that element
[10:51:34] <eddiemonge> ?xy
[10:51:46] <eddiemonge> ... i miss bot-t ...
[10:52:09] <johnkpaul> :( me too
[10:52:22] <eddiemonge> mertin:  then do like i said and do it on a click event instead of an link
[10:52:42] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I don't understand how to pass more than a key and a value using _setOption
[10:52:54] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you don't have to
[10:53:01] <ajpiano> userland code doesn't ever call _setOption
[10:53:18] <ajpiano> you call $("widget").widgetName("option", {multipl: "options", go: "here"});
[10:53:31] <ajpiano> and then it calls _setOptions which loops through that and calls _setOption for each one
[10:54:21] <jeffsmykil> do i have to redefine the options in the _setOption function?
[10:54:40] <ajpiano> whatever that means, i don't think so ;)
[10:55:09] <jeffsmykil> ok so how do I get all the options passed?
[10:55:17] <jeffsmykil> i just use this. again?
[10:55:35] <ajpiano> when do you want them?
[10:55:52] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: at the time they've all been passd?
[10:56:03] <jeffsmykil> in the setoption function
[10:56:06] <ajpiano> you don't
[10:56:15] <ajpiano> you'd have to add a _setOptions method as well
[10:57:00] <jeffsmykil> so _setOptions: function(WHAT GOES IN HERE) {}
[10:57:46] <ajpiano> function(options) {    }
[10:58:04] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L312-320 is the logic you'd be having to supply yourself
[10:59:10] <jeffsmykil> I'm trying, I really am, sorry for bothering you
[10:59:28] <ajpiano> i realise that
[10:59:40] <sunbeam> I've got 10 fields (form fields). I would only like to check whether they contain 1 or more character, and in case they don't, set a border accross those fields that don't .. how can I do this best?
[10:59:49] <jeffsmykil> it doesn't seem to be calling setoptions
[11:00:05] <ajpiano> the widget factory isn't??
[11:00:10] <jeffsmykil> $(".widgetContainer").dashboardCount("option", {"count" : counts[0] + "," +  counts[1], "maxValue" : "25"});
[11:00:18] <jeffsmykil> that should go into setOptions not setOption
[11:00:36] <ajpiano> it goes into both
[11:00:50] <jeffsmykil> when i put a console log in setoptions it never fires
[11:01:00] <ajpiano> did you call it _setOptions or setOptions
[11:01:16] <jeffsmykil>     _setOptions: function(options) {
[11:02:27] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: do you have a more explicit question? Have you tried to achieve this yourself?
[11:02:33] <ajpiano> well then i don't know unless i se a fiddle or paste as you kno
[11:02:40] <jeffsmykil> ok
[11:02:43] <jeffsmykil> hold on
[11:02:51] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: somehow yes, but not really a fast way, just checking the form fields 1 by 1
[11:03:33] <johnkpaul> so it is too slow, sunbeam? there is no way to avoid checking each form field individually
[11:04:13] <LordThumper> Hello. When would an AJAX complete callback called BEFORE the success callback?
[11:05:31] <LordThumper> There is even a delay of 1-2 seconds between complete callback and success callback
[11:06:11] <eddiemonge> sunbeam:  $('input').change(function(){ $(this).css('border', this.value.length === ''  ? '30px dotted pink' :  0 ); } });
[11:06:12] <johnkpaul> ?demo @LordThumper
[11:07:06] <RyanD> is there a jQuery UI room?
[11:07:14] <LordThumper> Ok it even seems the success callback is called before Chrome states "XHR finished loading"
[11:07:15] <RyanD> kind of a fundamental issue here, but don't want to spam this one.
[11:07:46] <LordThumper> johnkpaul, it will be very difficult to reproduce my problem, due to Cross Site Ajax calls
[11:07:55] <eddiemonge> RyanD:  ask away
[11:07:57] <tw2113> RyanD #jqueryui-dev
[11:07:59] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: then at least pastebin your code

[11:08:12] <jeffsmykil> oh good god
[11:08:24] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[11:08:28] <jeffsmykil> yeah don't do that
[11:08:32] <jeffsmykil> jsfiddle.net
[11:08:38] <xiam> what the fuck was he trying to do?
[11:08:49] <johnkpaul> paste a url
[11:08:49] <jeffsmykil> enrage you, did it work?
[11:08:52] <BillCriswell> I guess share his theme for jqueryui? I dunno.
[11:08:53] <johnkpaul> without a shorterner
[11:09:49] <xiam> irc, always like the old times.
[11:10:26] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, do i need css to modify jquery dialog box so that corners are square?
[11:10:58] <jeffsmykil> d3f4ultr0: yes
[11:11:12] <d3f4ultr0> k
[11:12:02] <LordThumper> http://pastebin.com/B04uXirz
[11:12:26] <LordThumper> Would really appreciate it if someone gave it a look
[11:12:36] <d3f4ultr0> this is what firebug sees, how am I suppose to call that? It's dynamically created,  <div class="ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all " ......
[11:12:55] <jeffsmykil> alter the jqueryui css file d3f4ultr0
[11:12:59] <d3f4ultr0> i tried adding .ui-dialog {} but it didn't work
[11:13:01] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: what does BlockUnblockBillingDetails return?
[11:13:37] <johnkpaul> you are actually calling those functions before the ajax call is finished, LordThumper
[11:13:39] <LordThumper> johnkpaul: It is not returning anything, (no return code)
[11:13:45] <SynchronE> hi everyone. How can I subscribe to a jquery ui widget event which is fired via $.trigger from inside the widget ?
[11:13:45] <d3f4ultr0> ididn't know there is a jquery ui css. What is the filename?
[11:13:47] <johnkpaul> yeah, so LordThumper, your code is incorrect
[11:13:51] <johnkpaul> it expects it to return a function
[11:14:03] <johnkpaul> on line 14, you are calling BlockUnblockBillingDetails immediatel
[11:14:05] <LordThumper> oh wait
[11:14:08] <johnkpaul> you are not passing it as a callback
[11:14:10] <simple__> Can someone help point out, once you got a google map, how do you get that map ID?
[11:14:11] <LordThumper> let me see
[11:14:12] <d3f4ultr0> but johnkpaul, I don't want to update the css since there are windows that my teammate is using too
[11:14:28] <johnkpaul> d3f4ultr0: i dont' think that was for me
[11:14:28] <LordThumper> oh I'm so stupid :/ didnt notice
[11:14:39] <d3f4ultr0> oops
[11:14:39] <brettster> what yall think
[11:14:40] <brettster> www.brettfrable.com
[11:14:49] <LordThumper> Is there any way to pass the true Boolean parameter?
[11:14:56] <d3f4ultr0> but jeffsmykil. I don't want to update the css since there are windows that my teammate is using too
[11:15:26] <LordThumper> in the ajax callback?
[11:15:29] <jeffsmykil> ...use two style sheets?
[11:15:35] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0: then create a custom css file for just your page
[11:15:36] <jeffsmykil> try inline styles to make it work?
[11:15:44] <LordThumper> Anyways thanks for resolving my problem, wouldn't have noticed it on my own
[11:15:47] <jeffsmykil> don't be inconsistant with rounded corners?
[11:15:53] <d3f4ultr0> eddiemonge, I did which I mentioned earlier but it is not working
[11:16:08] <d3f4ultr0>         .ui-dialog {                 border: 1px solid #777777;                 border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;         }
[11:16:29] <jeffsmykil> it's being over ridden somewhere use firebug to find out where
[11:16:36] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  are you including it in the page after the jqueryui.css file?
[11:16:57] <d3f4ultr0> my css is the last file
[11:17:08] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  do what jeffsmykil  said
[11:17:22] <d3f4ultr0> ?
[11:17:33] <d3f4ultr0> it's a welcome box
[11:17:51] <d3f4ultr0> the designer(crap) gave me a screenshot of the welcome box as square
[11:18:02] <d3f4ultr0> it's fine if i leave it as rounded
[11:18:23] <d3f4ultr0> still interested on how to make it work
[11:18:27] <phidev> d3f4ultr0, haven't you seen Windows 8, removing rounded corners is all the rage
[11:18:34] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0: trace it to see whats changing your style or why its not being applied
[11:18:48] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: you can create a new function that cals BlockUnblockBillingDetails with a fixed argument
[11:18:49] <d3f4ultr0> i did using firebug
[11:19:01] <d3f4ultr0> i saw windows 8, it's phenomenal
[11:19:12] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 read something about CSS selectors specificy
[11:19:17] <ravenzz> city
[11:19:26] <d3f4ultr0> k
[11:19:35] <ravenzz> you'll figure something out
[11:19:44] <johnkpaul> ?g selectutorial @ d3f4ultr0
[11:19:45] <caniuse> d3f4ultr0: Selectutorial: CSS selectors - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/
[11:19:59] <johnkpaul> is caniuse, the new bot-t?
[11:20:02] <eddiemonge> LordThumper:  pass in an anon function thats calling your function
[11:20:19] <ravenzz> no?
[11:20:26] <d3f4ultr0> my confusion is that the class the jquery made for my dialog window is dynamic
[11:20:47] <ravenzz> who is the jquery?
[11:20:49] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: eddiemonge just a cool way to do it - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/321113/how-can-i-pre-set-arguments-in-javascript-function-call-partial-function-appli
[11:21:07] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  its dynamic but dynamically the same
[11:21:39] <d3f4ultr0> this is what it made, http://pastebin.com/3rfjrgV5
[11:21:51] <d3f4ultr0> look at the class name
[11:21:59] <ravenzz> :∞
[11:22:20] <ravenzz> ok how is it dynamic?
[11:22:35] <d3f4ultr0> because I did not write it
[11:22:42] <ravenzz> nice
[11:22:53] <ravenzz> can you provide a live demo of your issue?
[11:23:11] <ravenzz> also you should avoid inline style
[11:23:15] <d3f4ultr0> it's not an issue. I just want the corner to be square rather than rounded
[11:23:44] <ravenzz> remove that class?
[11:23:52] <ravenzz> .ui-corner-all <-
[11:23:59] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0: i dont know what thats supposed to be
[11:24:13] <d3f4ultr0> this is how I am creating my dialog, http://pastebin.com/Hj8eV2fb
[11:25:21] <d3f4ultr0> the .welcomebox becomes inside the dialog, I can see it when I use the blue arrow in Firebug
[11:26:11] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  you are new to css and web development right?
[11:26:23] <ravenzz> would you me to google for you the question?
[11:26:50] <rapha> eddiemonge: yeah I had figured meanwhile that you can get it from $(this).attr('href') :-)
[11:26:59] <d3f4ultr0> yup but I do understand it
[11:27:03] <d3f4ultr0> i'll take a screenshot
[11:28:08] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  its not that we need that. you need to overwrite that class in your custom css file.
[11:28:16] <eddiemonge> its really more of a css question at this point
[11:28:16] <eddyb> so, I need an iframe to resize so it can show all the content inside
[11:28:36] <lathan> eddyb, is the iframe pointing at a page on your same subdomain?
[11:29:12] <d3f4ultr0> eddiemonge, that's what I mentioned earlier. I have my own screen.css file but looks like the class I wrote there is not correct
[11:29:40] <d3f4ultr0> yes, sorry, it's more of css but was hoping jquery might have a property for it
[11:30:30] <lathan> eddyb, if so, look at this page: http://th.atguy.com/mycode/iframe_size/
[11:31:03] <d3f4ultr0> eddiemonge, firebug told me that class is "ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all". I only wrote .ui-dialog. Not sure if I should write all.
[11:31:13] <eddyb> lathan: yes, same everything
[11:32:21] <hlveheart> anybody know why adding fade to modal on bootstrap, the fading animation doesn't work in IE, but jQuery's .fade works just fine?
[11:32:38] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 that is the widget content
[11:33:16] <eddyb> lathan: gah, I don't need onLoad. I need it to change whenever the content inside changes
[11:33:38] <d3f4ultr0> ravenz, how can I create a classname for it?
[11:34:06] <d3f4ultr0> showing code again, http://pastebin.com/Hj8eV2fb
[11:34:35] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 do you want to remove the corner?
[11:34:39] <LordThumper> Ok solved using an anonymous function, thanks alot johnkpaul, eddiemonge
[11:34:41] <ravenzz> rounded corners
[11:34:45] <johnkpaul> no problem, LordThumper
[11:35:00] <d3f4ultr0> ravenzz, yes, I don't like rounded
[11:35:02] <eddiemonge> hlveheart: because bootstrap is not good
[11:35:33] <eddiemonge> d3f4ultr0:  you dont create a class name for it. you define the styles for that in your css file
[11:35:57] <d3f4ultr0> sigh
[11:36:10] <d3f4ultr0> looks like you are not getting it
[11:36:24] <d3f4ultr0> i think ravenzz is getting it
[11:36:25] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 ok this is the CSS selector .ui-corner-all, .ui-corner-bottom, .ui-corner-left, .ui-corner-bl
[11:36:32] <d3f4ultr0> awesome
[11:36:39] <d3f4ultr0> i'll try it
[11:36:40] <ravenzz> otherwise you can remove the ui-corner-all class on create
[11:36:49] <ravenzz> that would be even easier
[11:37:03] <d3f4ultr0> how do I do the latter?
[11:37:23] <d3f4ultr0> rather than hacking the css
[11:37:41] <ajpiano> re-requesting the theme to just have a border-radius of 0
[11:37:42] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/M3NTw/
[11:37:47] <ajpiano> would be the best thing, i'd tend to think
[11:37:54] <ravenzz> yes
[11:38:24] <ajpiano> or writing a rule to overwrite it, not inside of the actual theme.css
[11:38:31] <ravenzz> ^
[11:38:38] <ravenzz> that's the best way
[11:38:39] <ajpiano> using javascript to solve the problem....doesn't really solve the problem
[11:38:46] <d3f4ultr0> thanks
[11:38:47] <ravenzz> well
[11:39:08] <ravenzz> the dialog itself is made by js
[11:39:16] <ajpiano> true enough
[11:39:22] <ravenzz> so :p it is not a big problem imho
[11:39:27] <ajpiano> but it seems like he doesn't want rounded corners on anything from jquery ui
[11:39:36] <ajpiano> so the Right Way‚Ñ¢ is to just make the theme say that
[11:39:51] <ravenzz> he know both ways now .. so buh it is up to him i guess
[11:39:57] <ajpiano> indeed
[11:40:45] <eddiemonge> or her
[11:41:07] <rapha> eddiemonge: there is another problem i have with the dialog ... i set it's zDialog = 2 but it still doesn't go below my elements that have a z-index => 3 ... ?
[11:42:00] <eddiemonge> you mean z-Index? not zDialog?
[11:42:53] <d3f4ultr0> what's wrong with my code, ravenzz, http://pastebin.com/9nGqxz9F
[11:42:57] <AL____> Hello, can we style our forms with jquery ui ?
[11:44:01] <AL____> can we style our forms with jquery ui ?
[11:44:08] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: is today jquery ui day or something?
[11:44:33] <ajpiano> AL____: jquery ui doesn't really have any form styling helpers by default
[11:44:39] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: lol
[11:44:48] <AL____> hmm
[11:44:53] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: can you post the link hyou did for me again
[11:44:54] <johnkpaul> seriously, there have been more jquery ui questions today than I think any other day I've been around
[11:44:59] <jeffsmykil> the tabs stiff with the options
[11:45:10] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L312-320 ?
[11:45:18] <rapha> eddiemonge: as per http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-zIndex ...
[11:45:20] <jeffsmykil> ty
[11:45:30] <AL____> well, I'm just getting started.. can you plz tell me what jquery ui can accomplish ?
[11:45:40] <eddiemonge> rapha:  have you inspected it?
[11:45:53] <AL____> couldn't actually follow the tutorials..
[11:46:28] <ajpiano> AL____: http://weblog.bocoup.com/giving-jquery-ui-another-chance-and-really-liking-it/
[11:46:43] <AL____> okay, taking a look :)
[11:46:51] <DerMaddin> can somebody help me with jQuery autocomplete function? Get an error and don't know how to fix it. I work with demos and documentation of jqueryui.com
[11:46:57] <d3f4ultr0> ravenzz, the class is gone but corner is still rounded. class="ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content"
[11:47:11] <ajpiano> ?ask @ DerMaddin
[11:47:30] <ajpiano> this is why it's a lot easier to just redefine the classes that add the borders
[11:47:47] <macclearich_> any validation samurai hanging about?
[11:48:14] <johnkpaul> ?g validation samurai
[11:48:15] <caniuse> johnkpaul: Red Samurai Tool - JDeveloper 11g Extension to Validate ADF ... - http://andrejusb.blogspot.com/2010/03/red-samurai-tool-jdeveloper-11g.html
[11:48:27] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know
[11:48:36] <DerMaddin> I tryed out the sample code and get error, saying "Uncaught exception: TypeError: '$("#birds")
[11:49:07] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I really don't understand why it isn't hitting setOptions
[11:49:20] <macclearich_> I've got a rather exasperating collision between IE, jquery.placeholder, jquery.validate, and password fields.
[11:51:30] <jeffsmykil> AHA
[11:52:00] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: figured it out?
[11:52:16] <jeffsmykil> i made a step in the right direction
[11:52:28] <DerMaddin> I tried out sample code from your website, but get errors. If someone can help me with the autocomplete function, i would be pleased...
[11:52:34] <DerMaddin> testsite: http://www.universal-alliance.de/test.php
[11:54:30] <d3f4ultr0> ravenzz, any ideas?
[11:54:41] <d3f4ultr0> jeffsmykil, what about you?
[11:54:56] <DerMaddin> :(
[11:55:09] <johnkpaul> DerMaddin: when you built jquery ui, did you select autocomplete?
[11:55:39] <DerMaddin> oh man, thanks :D
[11:56:03] <DerMaddin> i had some other autocomplete script from other source..
[11:56:17] <DerMaddin> didnt notice that one..
[11:56:41] <DerMaddin> will try it
[11:58:32] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 man, listen to ajpiano
[11:59:19] <eddyb> so, how can I automatically detect changes in an iframe inner content height and update the iframe's outer height?
[11:59:34] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 do that in css
[12:01:03] <rapha> so i have #div which is display:hidden and then i do $('a.something').click(function(){ $('#div').load($(this).attr('href').dialog(); }); and on the server i can see it loads but the new content is invisible?!
[12:01:47] <DerMaddin> is there any documentation how and where to implement the jquery script files. because it is not enogh to copy the code out of the index.html of the maindirectory?!
[12:02:55] <DerMaddin> do i have to include all script files of the development-boundle directory?
[12:03:31] <rogeruiz> ajpiano: hey
[12:03:39] <ajpiano> hi?
[12:03:52] <rogeruiz> hey sorry. i was testing out IRC
[12:03:57] <ajpiano> it works.
[12:04:01] <jeffsmykil> rofl
[12:04:11] <rogeruiz> althoughI do have a question when it comes to jQuery UI datepicker
[12:04:20] <rogeruiz> though this is a more general topic
[12:04:22] <jeffsmykil> i hate that mofo
[12:04:47] <eddyb> so, uhm, no idea?
[12:04:52] <rogeruiz> has anyone every had any luck integrating more than just day of the month data into the datepicker?
[12:06:28] <ravenzz> calendar for a truck driver with naked girls pictures for example?
[12:07:26] <bmachine> my kind of calendar!
[12:07:29] <rogeruiz> nah
[12:07:41] <rogeruiz> more like integrating pricing into a particular day of the week ravenzz
[12:08:20] <ravenzz> eheh no sorry
[12:08:32] <rogeruiz> ravenzz: it's cool
[12:08:35] <rogeruiz> thanks
[12:08:44] <rogeruiz> I was thikning that this would need to be a custom built thing anyway
[12:09:04] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: so I have some of it working, but since setOption gets each option individually, how do i make decissions if they are based off other options
[12:09:17] <rogeruiz> there are no public, or even private methods?, to integrate any more than just _date_ data into the calendar
[12:11:54] <rogeruiz> LIST
[12:11:56] <rogeruiz> ????
[12:11:59] <rogeruiz> dammit
[12:12:14] <rogeruiz> i'm outta here, thanks for allowing me to pick the brain about the datepicker thing
[12:12:25] <ajpiano> rogeruiz: you can bust into the widget but the datepciker is particularly inf... never mind
[12:14:46] <d3f4ultr0> thanks ravenzz, waiting for ajpiano :)
[12:15:16] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you can set related optoins in the setOption method or setOptions, i guess
[12:15:29] <ajpiano> or just straight up set this.options.foo = "bar"; if you don'tw ant to be able to react
[12:15:34] <ajpiano> d3f4ultr0: what are you waiting for?
[12:15:46] <d3f4ultr0> ajpiano, in case you missed it, I want to remove the rounded corners from the dialog window that jquery created
[12:15:54] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: this all stsarted easily enough lol
[12:15:57] <ajpiano> write some css
[12:16:02] <d3f4ultr0> code i wrote is http://pastebin.com/Hj8eV2fb
[12:16:07] <Druide_> i think i'll be very very quiet on the internet tomorrow
[12:17:16] <tw2113> why?
[12:17:25] <Druide_> diablo
[12:17:28] <piker32> looking for a little help on wiring up jquery events on an html response received from an ajax call
[12:17:48] <ajpiano> d3f4ultr0: are you expecitng me to tell you what CSS to write?
[12:18:15] <d3f4ultr0> i know what to write but the class is confusing me
[12:18:23] <piker32> sadly its related to supporting some legacy code that uses the oBout control set
[12:18:27] <rapha> wtf? why does .load keep on loading the thing over and over and over again?!
[12:18:30] <d3f4ultr0> the class name as seen by ravenzz are widgest
[12:18:39] <d3f4ultr0> widgets
[12:18:52] <ajpiano> d3f4ultr0: tweak until you get something that works
[12:18:56] <ajpiano> that's all someone else is going to do
[12:19:26] <d3f4ultr0> k
[12:20:13] <d3f4ultr0> i tried this, it didn't work, .ui-corner-all, .ui-corner-bottom, .ui-corner-left, .ui-corner-bl. I'll try the class name now
[12:20:35] <ajpiano> what did you "try" about that
[12:22:01] <d3f4ultr0> i tried this one in my screen.css file, still didn't work. .ui-dialog .ui-widget .ui-widget-content { border: 1px solid #777777; border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px; }
[12:22:28] <jeffsmykil> are you seting webkit-border-radius
[12:22:32] <jeffsmykil> and moz-border-radius
[12:22:40] <jeffsmykil> because im pretty sure ui does
[12:22:41] <d3f4ultr0> this is what firebug shows to me <div class="ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content"
[12:22:51] <ajpiano> d3f4ultr0: you have to set all the variants like in here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.css#L240-243
[12:22:51] <d3f4ultr0> no
[12:22:59] <d3f4ultr0> checking
[12:23:30] <d3f4ultr0> oh, just like what jeyffsmykil mentioned
[12:24:01] <d3f4ultr0> jeffsmykil, but what about my class name in the css file, is it correcT?
[12:24:48] <d3f4ultr0> ah, I got  it
[12:24:54] <d3f4ultr0> thanks ajpiano
[12:25:04] <jeffsmykil> yes, thank you ajpiano
[12:25:08] <jeffsmykil> thank you very much
[12:28:12] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a good regexp channel?
[12:28:16] <d3f4ultr0> i see my screen.css is being seen now in Firebug
[12:28:59] <ajpiano> d3f4ultr0: fwiw, this would prob do the trick http://fixee.org/paste/7cfku21/
[12:28:59] <d3f4ultr0> however, the corner is still rounded. The is what Firebug is showing,  border-bottom-right-radius: 0; but there is a underline on top of the letters
[12:29:20] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld guess the name?
[12:29:32] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: I tried that... empty room
[12:29:32] <d3f4ultr0> that's what I wrote
[12:29:44] <ravenzz> regex
[12:30:01] <d3f4ultr0> does is affect it if I wrote 0px
[12:30:09] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 http://jsfiddle.net/kVjxZ/
[12:30:10] <batterhead> is .on() chainable?
[12:30:25] <jeffsmykil> wtf is fiee
[12:31:11] <johnkpaul> batterhead: yes
[12:31:31] <d3f4ultr0> saw the problem! :( gheez, even if my screen.css is called, jquery takes over
[12:31:51] <batterhead> so $('#blah').on('mouseenter', '.myClass', function(){}).on('mouseleave', etc.) is the way to go?
[12:32:29] <d3f4ultr0> jquery...tom.css appears after my screen.css on the right pane of firebug :(
[12:33:15] <johnkpaul> batterhead: that should work fine, are you having an issue doing it like that?
[12:33:39] <d3f4ultr0> damn, all our js are loaded after all css :(
[12:33:40] <batterhead> yes, but I think it was something else now that i am reviewing
[12:34:09] <ravenzz> d3f4ultr0 doesn't matter when/where your js is loaded/running
[12:34:21] <ravenzz> it is all about the css
[12:34:49] <ravenzz> try including the jquery ui one right before your own stylesheet
[12:35:24] <sunbeam> alert($(this).name); - i want to get the name="email" etc name of a input field
[12:35:25] <sunbeam> whats wrong with what i currently use?
[12:35:43] <ravenzz> ?attr @ sunbeam
[12:35:43] <caniuse> sunbeam: .attr(): Set one or more attributes for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:35:45] <diamonds> what's a good way to test that an event has been bound to a selector?
[12:35:54] <diamonds> I'm using jasmine fwiw
[12:36:17] <diamonds> I see $.cache.1 has some... stuff in it
[12:36:33] <sunbeam> thanks caniuse
[12:37:33] <sunbeam> caniuse: does concat like in phpo $var .= "this"; works aqswell?
[12:37:37] <sunbeam> php* aswell*
[12:37:39] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: thanks the code is working now
[12:37:41] <mehrdadii> :)
[12:37:58] <ravenzz> cool
[12:38:34] <sunbeam> newvar .= $(this).attr("name")) + " ,";
[12:38:37] <mehrdadii> the problem was I had a shorcode in my template [table] it was returning that one
[12:38:42] <sunbeam> does anyone know how i can best use this?
[12:38:57] <eddyb> sunbeam: there is no concat operator in JS
[12:38:59] <eddyb> just +
[12:39:19] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: thanks again :) also I had to put another 2 line in my plugin :)
[12:39:49] <ravenzz> yeah well you could ask them to add that feature, it could be useful
[12:40:10] <mehrdadii> yeah I told the guy
[12:40:19] <mehrdadii> has has the code now :)
[12:40:28] <sunbeam> eddyb: newvar += $(this).attr("name")) + " ,";
[12:40:29] <sunbeam> this?
[12:41:08] <eddyb> there is an extra paren in there
[12:41:10] <ravenzz> you have a round parenthesis more
[12:41:10] <eddyb> but yeah
[12:42:21] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: I really like to learn jquery. do you a souce (book or online)
[12:42:37] <ravenzz> uhm I don't know
[12:42:39] <ravenzz> ?doc
[12:42:48] <ajpiano> http://jqfundamentals.com/book @ mehrdadii
[12:43:11] <sunbeam> oh sorry
[12:43:13] <mehrdadii> great
[12:43:13] <sunbeam> thanks eddyb
[12:44:09] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I think I finally have this mother fucker working right
[12:44:26] <jeffsmykil> and I only killed 2 pandas and a baby kangaroo in the process
[12:45:22] <andr0id> hey guyz, i need little help
[12:45:40] <jeffsmykil> don't we all
[12:45:53] <andr0id> its about colorbox, jquery plugin
[12:46:11] <orangey> jeffsmykil: hah! i know the feeling re killing animals
[12:46:26] <jeffsmykil> o_0 I was kidding, I hope you are too...
[12:46:30] <lathan> eddyb, best thing I've found: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-resize/examples/resize/
[12:46:44] <lathan> eddyb, or did you find that frame resize problem?
[12:46:54] <andr0id> can anyone help me a little with that?
[12:47:04] <orangey> jeffsmykil: but there are few finer pleasures than the moment after you get something to work and before you decide you need to improve it
[12:47:10] <lathan> ?ask
[12:47:23] <lathan> andr0id, don't ask if you can have help...just ask your question
[12:47:26] <jeffsmykil> orangey:  I already know it needs to be improved lol
[12:48:25] <andr0id> ok, i have the colorbox plugin, and i have the function that closes the colorbox. now, after closing the colorbox, i want to be sent on a page that is something like: products.php?id=23
[12:49:17] <jeffsmykil> ok...
[12:49:21] <jeffsmykil> window.location?
[12:49:43] <andr0id> can i paste the line of code here that closes the colorbox?
[12:50:15] <jeffsmykil> use a paste site unless its one line
[12:50:22] <andr0id> its only one line
[12:50:24] <andr0id> <script>parent.$.fn.colorbox.close();</script>
[12:50:30] <monk12> Can anyone confirm IE8/9 doesn't do history.back() correctly in this simple example: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36600570/post-1.html ... Each page just POSTS and jquery catches that and redirects to next page like post-2.html and so on... (simulating a POST-Redirect-GET web app pattern)... I noticed it doesn't work in IE8/9 and wasnt sure why... Try submitting the forms until until page5 and then click Back button, u goto page-4.html. But then if you click Back
[12:50:30] <monk12> on that page, it goes to page-5.html even though the Hstory list in IE looks fine
[12:50:35] <lathan> you need to wait for the colorbox to close. bind to an event...
[12:50:50] <lathan> andr0id, http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox See down in Event Hooks
[12:51:10] <lathan> andr0id, or the callback: onclose
[12:51:37] <lathan> andr0id, ah...what is your colorbox on?
[12:51:48] <andr0id> how do you mean: on?
[12:51:53] <lathan> andr0id, it should be something like parent.$('#div').colorbox(...)
[12:52:31] <lathan> andr0id, parent.$('#id_of_colorbox').colorbox.close()
[12:52:31] <andr0id> iframe
[12:52:47] <lathan> oh
[12:53:01] <lathan> this is being called form inside the iframe that colorbox opened up in?
[12:53:08] <andr0id> yes
[12:53:13] <lathan> andr0id, is this your own custom iframe page? or is it opening up its own page?
[12:53:21] <andr0id> yes
[12:53:34] <andr0id> <a class='iframe' href="products.php?page=none">Produse</a>
[12:53:49] <eddyb> ?appendAfter
[12:54:29] <lathan> andr0id, I think you should $('.iframe').colorbox({ onClosed: function(){ location.href = '/products.php....' } })
[12:55:15] <devmikey> Question: pastebin.com/uC1Yj9VB
[12:55:31] <devmikey> I want to call that in body onLoad()
[12:55:34] <andr0id> <script>parent.$.fn.colorbox.close();</script> should i add that code after ; ?
[12:55:38] <andr0id> before script?
[12:55:45] <andr0id> before </script>?
[12:55:47] <sunbeam> is there a jquery function that can count the amount of times a certain class occurs?
[12:55:48] <devmikey> it says loadTheTable not defined
[12:56:04] <lathan> sunbeam, $('.className').length
[12:56:12] <lathan> andr0id, before the </script>
[12:56:25] <andr0id> ok let me try
[12:56:29] <lathan> andr0id, no, wait
[12:56:48] <lathan> andr0id, if you want to run a callback after the iframe has been closed, it has to run from the parent frame (not inside the iframe that is being closed)
[12:57:37] <andr0id> lathan: how?
[12:57:56] <lathan> "lathan: andr0id, I think you should $('.iframe').colorbox({ onClosed: function(){ location.href = '/products.php....' } })"
[12:58:11] <lathan> andr0id, if you want more help, I need to see some kind of working demo
[12:58:14] <andr0id> i did that, its not workink
[12:58:20] <andr0id> i did that, its not working
[12:58:34] <jeffsmykil> anyone know of a css sprite generator that doesnt suck?
[12:58:44] <lathan> need to see a demo
[12:58:59] <lathan> jeffsmykil, not me....this is the jQuery channel after all.....
[12:59:09] <andr0id> its only on my local server, dunno how to show you a demo
[12:59:21] <jeffsmykil> lathan: yes i get confused easily
[12:59:41] <lathan> andr0id, make a simple example on jsfiddle.net (make sure to put in jquery, and the plugin source)
[13:00:13] <andr0id> all the sources i have are local
[13:00:52] <d3f4ultr0> ajpiano, look at firebug output. It shows that my screen.css is read. http://i.imgur.com/2EcE0.png
[13:01:06] <d3f4ultr0> however, corners are still rounded
[13:01:14] <lathan> andr0id, okay...well at least copy up some of the code on pastebin.com
[13:01:39] <andr0id> ok
[13:03:41] <andr0id> http://pastebin.com/EhzThhdn
[13:03:56] <eddyb> how can I get the iframe I'm in?
[13:04:23] <eddyb> like, actual iframe element for a given window/document
[13:04:24] <lathan> the one you are in?
[13:04:35] <lathan> frames[frameName]
[13:04:49] <eddyb> XD
[13:04:55] <eddyb> not something stupid like that
[13:05:03] <eddyb> I have a window/document, I'm inside the iframe
[13:05:17] <eddyb> how do I get the specific iframe element I'm in?
[13:05:17] <lathan> the actual iframe element?
[13:05:34] <eddyb> something like document.parentElement
[13:05:39] <eddyb> except that doesn't work
[13:05:55] <andr0id> any ideas on my problem?
[13:06:56] <eddyb> nevermind
[13:07:03] <andr0id> well?
[13:07:05] <eddyb> parent. xD('iframe').filter(function(){return parent. xD(this).contents()[0]==document});
[13:07:45] <eddyb> dammit, stupid filter
[13:07:50] <andr0id> anyone?
[13:07:57] <eddyb> parent.$('iframe').filter(function(){return parent.$(this).contents()[0]==document});
[13:08:19] <andr0id> that is the solution for me?
[13:08:22] <sunbeam> is there a function in jquery with which you can have the first letter in uppercase?
[13:08:26] <sunbeam> lathan: thanks btw
[13:09:19] <lathan> andr0id, you have to give some information. what code opens it? does that closing code actually work/
[13:09:21] <lathan> sunbeam, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1026069/capitalize-the-first-letter-of-string-in-javascript
[13:09:50] <symbol> Hey guys, is it possible to get to the higher layer of $('this') ?  http://pastebin.com/jnT8MyAc
[13:09:57] <andr0id> yes, the closing code works
[13:10:37] <eddyb> andr0id: no, my find for my problem
[13:12:29] <andr0id> eddyb, how does your code sends me to lets say this page: products.php?page=start ?
[13:13:58] <hashpuppy> any of you guys use coffeescript + jquery + map?  I'm getting weird results.  it's like it's mapping an array inside the jquery object?
[13:14:03] <hashpuppy> so it returns the whole object
[13:14:39] <lathan> symb, $(this).get(0)
[13:14:43] <eddyb> andr0id: hmm?
[13:14:52] <lathan> eddyb, I hate testing frames....
[13:15:16] <hashpuppy> $(".locations:checked").map(function(i, v) { return $(v).val(); }); works fine, while locations = $(".locations:checked").map (i, v) -> $(v).val() seems to return a jquery object with the mapped array inside
[13:15:27] <eddyb> lathan: $(this).get(0) === $(this)[0] === this
[13:15:43] <lathan> symbol, ^^
[13:16:43] <lathan> hashpuppy, jQuery is an object with the array inside, with a bunch of extra functions
[13:17:04] <sunbeam> I have <p class='error'>Email, Address, Town, Postcode, </p>
[13:17:04] <symbol> damn. this is so shitty. It shouldn't be so hard should it?
[13:17:11] <sunbeam> how can I remove the last , from this class?
[13:17:13] <lathan> hashpuppy, I have no idea how that could work. if it does, its not likely to work everywhere
[13:17:19] <sunbeam> from the contents? is there a proper way to do that?
[13:17:21] <hashpuppy> yeah, and unfortunately coffeescript is using its own map and not jquery's
[13:17:49] <lathan> sunbeam, probably get the html, and regex the last comma off the end
[13:18:14] <sunbeam> lathan: ok
[13:18:29] <sunbeam> just wonder how to write a regex that looks for the last, in a string
[13:18:35] <sunbeam> any idea where i should look for?
[13:19:41] <lathan> sunbeam, /(.*),$/
[13:19:56] <sunbeam> ok! thanks
[13:19:59] <symbol> could someone take a look to my codesnippet? I stuck on this issue and can't work further :(
[13:20:08] <devmikey> Question: pastebin.com/uC1Yj9VB
[13:20:15] <devmikey> I want to call that in body onLoad()
[13:20:19] <devmikey> it says loadTheTable not defined
[13:20:51] <devmikey> Or even easier, I basically want to replace an elements innerhtml on pageload
[13:21:05] <devmikey> any sample of that would solve my problem
[13:21:55] <sunbeam> lathan: result_fields.replace('/(.*),$', ""); like this gives no syntax errors but doesnt work
[13:22:18] <lathan> sunbeam, is result_fields the html or the jQuery obj of the element
[13:22:29] <lathan> sunbeam, then you would have to put that html back in the element
[13:22:32] <sunbeam> lathan: result_fields is a var that contains a string
[13:22:40] <lathan> .html(result_fields.replace(...))
[13:22:43] <lathan> sunbeam, ^
[13:22:43] <sunbeam> i put the html back with result_fields as value
[13:22:57] <sunbeam> lathan: $(".form_error_message").html("<p class='error_red'>Please correct the following fields:<br/>" + result_fields + "</p>");
[13:23:01] <lathan> woa...you are selecting everything and replacing it with nothing
[13:23:10] <symbol> website -> dynamic built table -> $.ajax()-event for every td in table --> indicator in every td for the associated td
[13:23:15] <lathan> try just .replace(/,$/,'')
[13:23:24] <sunbeam> ok
[13:23:44] <sunbeam> lathan: same :(
[13:25:20] <imachuchu> I have a bunch of divs composing a form (each row is a row in the form). Each row has it's own javascript attached to it (autocomplete, delete the row, add a new blank row if the previous blank row is edited completely). How is the best way to attach these functions to the new cloned row? Should I have one large "reattach everything" function, or reattach each function individually to just the new row?
[13:25:26] <imachuchu> if that makes sense
[13:25:51] <lathan> eddyb, I hate this concept, but I think it might work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Bhth9/8/
[13:27:13] <dmsuperman> If I have a query: $(':input', someNode)  which I filter using .not:  .not([someChildNode1, someChildNode2]), even if someChildNode1 and 2 are not inputs themselves, but parent containers of inputs, will all the contained inputs be correctly filtered out?
[13:27:15] <devmikey> Or even easier, I basically want to replace an elements innerhtml on pageload
[13:27:17] <devmikey> any sample of that would solve my problem
[13:27:35] <eddyb> lathan: is that contentWindow the same as window inside the iframe?
[13:27:45] <eddyb> I already solved it btw
[13:27:48] <andr0id> so noone can help me with my problem...
[13:27:50] <dmsuperman> Meaning: If I have a bunch of divs, and each div has 2 inputs, if I do $(':input').not(div) will it exclude both child inputs
[13:27:56] <eddyb> parent.$('iframe').filter(function(){return parent.$(this).contents()[0]==document});
[13:28:09] <lathan> eddyb, oh...and...basically the same way i did
[13:28:15] <sunbeam> lathan: any idea what goes wrong?
[13:28:18] <lathan> sunbeam, http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/MN58g/
[13:28:22] <lathan> works for me ^^
[13:28:50] <sunbeam> sec
[13:29:36] <andr0id> thats shame...
[13:29:38] <sunbeam> lathan: new_result = result_fields.replace(/,$/,'');
[13:29:48] <sunbeam> for some reason that gives a syntax err
[13:30:34] <sunbeam> oops sorry
[13:30:35] <eddyb> first of all, _ is ugly in JS
[13:30:40] <eddyb> try lowerCamelCase
[13:30:47] <lathan> sunbeam, is new_result defined?
[13:30:54] <eddyb> and that
[13:31:02] <lathan> eddyb, that's my fault.....
[13:31:11] <lathan> I hate Camel...
[13:31:35] * eddyb <3 camelTo... nevermind :D
[13:33:01] <Druide_> camelToe
[13:36:02] <sunbeam> lathan: i probably need to use a live function
[13:36:10] <sunbeam> because that removal is done after some other jquery manipulation
[13:36:54] <lathan> sunbeam, possible
[13:37:08] <lathan> sunbeam, you haven't shown me enough code for me to help past the regex and .html
[13:37:40] <dmsuperman> 16:30 < eddyb> first of all, _ is ugly in JS
[13:37:40] <dmsuperman> 16:30 < eddyb> try lowerCamelCase
[13:37:46] <dmsuperman> that is _entirely_ personal preference
[13:37:51] <dmsuperman> has nothing to do with the language
[13:38:26] <sunbeam> lathan: http://pastebin.com/vxDfgwZ5
[13:40:07] <eddyb> sunbeam: you realize that lines 3-8 are a single line, right?
[13:40:10] <lathan> sunbeam, are you sure both result_updated == true && formtest == false ?
[13:40:46] <eddyb> return checkForm("#form_thanks");
[13:40:48] <lathan> sunbeam, my first debugging step would be to confirm that those lines run
[13:41:11] <sunbeam> lathan: yes
[13:41:38] <sunbeam> eddyb: ah sorry your right
[13:42:27] <sunbeam> lathan: yes both are true, and the script runs, no error
[13:43:56] <lathan> sunbeam, and you are sure the error paragraph is put on the page?
[13:44:41] <lathan> sunbeam, are you sure that $('.form_error_messages').length > 0 ?
[13:44:55] <eddyb> hint, in chrome, Ctrl+Shift+J
[13:45:00] <eddyb> instant magic console
[13:45:06] <eddyb> you can use your jquery in there, too
[13:45:20] <eddyb> or any other JS code you have
[13:45:30] <sunbeam> ah nice didnt know
[13:45:34] <sunbeam> magic shit :)
[13:45:56] <SynchronE> guys, gow can i extend some jquery-ui widget ? I need to call "parent" method from the widget i'm extending with $.widget, but can't find how to call parentWidget.prototype.parentMethod with parameters
[13:46:23] <SynchronE> the only example i've got is method.call(this);
[13:46:44] <SynchronE> tried passing an array of arguments as a second parameter, but no luck
[13:47:15] <lathan> SynchronE, for using an array of arguments, use apply: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[13:47:29] <diamonds> hi friends
[13:47:32] <diamonds> http://www.hastebin.com/raw/vetogoteqa
[13:47:33] <lathan> SynchronE, .call(this, arg1, arg2, arg3) or .apply(this, arguments)
[13:47:43] <SynchronE> thanks
[13:48:07] <SynchronE> it's just WebStorm showed me .call(context,arguments), so i was misled
[13:48:31] <SynchronE> claimed to be ECMAScript
[13:48:40] <diamonds> http://screencast.com/t/1eZFBP5h8DI
[13:49:24] <diamonds> I remove an elem, do .off('.namespace') and events are STILL registered
[13:49:27] <diamonds> why is this
[13:49:45] <diamonds> see my bin above to try it in your console ^
[13:50:12] <eddyb> diamonds: I'd say you have to give an event name, not just the namespace, but I might be wrong
[13:50:25] <anli__> Shouldnt a div that display:none match with is(':visible');?
[13:50:35] <diamonds> eddyb: no, that's one of the benefits of namespaces
[13:50:38] <anli__> I meant !foo.is(':visible');
[13:50:55] <diamonds> I can bind to mouseover.foo click.foo and mousedown.foo, then .off('.foo') to disable them all
[13:50:57] <diamonds> irrc
[13:51:07] <diamonds> s/r/i/
[13:51:30] <diamonds> I'll try it tho
[13:51:58] <diamonds> eddyb: no it's still there
[13:52:07] <diamonds> $('.mybtn').off('mouseover.hiya');
[13:52:29] <eddyb> maybe, wrong jquery object you're applying it on
[13:54:02] <diamonds> eddyb: did you try it in your console?
[13:54:14] <diamonds> perhaps you can confirm or deny what I'm experiencing
[13:54:17] <eddyb> nope, I'm just guessing :S
[13:54:35] <arnpro> hey guys, I need some advice. I'm making a game, which the user will interact with. it's subdivided in "stages" they all got the same dom structure but hold diff data, for example diff select element options values or textboxes, etc. right now I'm managing the UI by jquery selectors and stuff, relying on the classes added to every object, so is that the best way? or should I turn them all into OOP and store their objcts into the .data(
[13:55:30] <eddyb> arnpro: no, the other way around
[13:55:40] <arnpro> what is it eddyb
[13:55:41] <eddyb> store DOM/jQuery in your game
[13:55:49] <anli__> I dont get it, isnt div.next('div:visible') finding next visible div?
[13:56:58] <arnpro> eddyb: Im working on the frontend, the javascript mainly, all the functionality so far is done by adding classes, and checking which 1 is added, which 1 isnt, but Im getting worried about how messy it could get, since there's a div with like 10 classes now...
[13:57:12] <eddyb> just wrong
[13:57:24] <eddyb> use your own infrastructure for the game
[13:57:35] <eddyb> and have that contain "links" to the interface
[13:57:56] <arnpro> eddyb: Im sorry Im not following you, may you elaborate please
[13:58:05] <lathan> anli_, :visible is looking at the css visibility attribute
[13:58:09] <eddyb> string operations (and especially selectors) will eat your face off
[13:58:28] <lathan> diamonds, I can reproduce your problem
[13:58:40] <anli__> lathan: really?
[13:58:49] <diamonds> lathan: thank you.  Thoughts?
[13:58:51] <lathan> anli_, at least it used to...what version are you using?
[13:58:55] <arnpro> eddyb: I had to write a plugin like 3 days ago, done it by instancing a new oop class and storing it in the element's .data() function, I thought that might work with the rest of the site aswell?
[13:58:58] <anli__> dunno
[13:59:02] <foo> http://x03.ath.cx/temp/kk.php - on this page, the background changes to represent different locations that this company has. When the background changes, it changes in the footer as well (it highlights the location of the office) - I can't figure out what is responsible for changing the links in the footer? I know the footer li items get a class of "here" added. Can anyone help narrow this down?
[13:59:03] <lathan> diamonds, I have little experience with jQuery > 1.4
[13:59:10] <diamonds> perhaps it keeps the obj.s around in case you want to rebind them (?)
[13:59:17] <lathan> diamonds, use this url to sell it: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Hwd3P/1/
[13:59:18] <diamonds> s/obj/event/
[13:59:34] <lathan> diamonds, it shouldn't. if you unbind them its usually for performance issues
[14:00:00] <eddyb> arnpro: pffft... write the game in JS, and store the jquery objects for different parts of the interface in your game's objects
[14:00:24] <eddyb> you can use callbacks to make parts of it easier
[14:00:43] <eddyb> but don't use selectors every freaking time
[14:01:19] <arnpro> eddyb: I get what you say, however it'd be easier with an example or something...
[14:01:34] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/Hwd3P/2/
[14:01:35] <diamonds> thanks
[14:01:36] <eddyb> .data() is not that much of a penalty, but it should be avoided if the data isn't binded directly to the element
[14:02:01] <diamonds> lathan: thanks.  I only noticed it cuz I'm testing event bindings on this module... normally I'd never even know :p
[14:02:08] <eddyb> arnpro: yeah, well, I can't write you an entire game right now
[14:02:14] <diamonds> testing flushes out all sorts of fun stuff :)
[14:02:24] <arnpro> eddyb: I was thinking .data() because I could do $('.stage').each(function(){ $(this).data('something'); }); and take from there
[14:02:26] <lathan> diamonds, sorry, my site is on 1.4 so I haven't figured out the "quirks" of off and on
[14:02:26] <eddyb> if you show me some code, I can tell you how it should look
[14:02:42] <eddyb> arnpro: in that case, have an array of stages
[14:03:05] <eddyb> each stage will be an objects, containing the jquery/DOM object as a property
[14:03:33] <eddyb> so it's your-objects-centered instead of jquery-centered
[14:03:42] <arnpro> so the stages will be rendered by the code? or they'll be there, and the functionality will be later added with the line I just wrote??
[14:03:46] <eddyb> it also depends on what you're doing
[14:04:00] <eddyb> I mean, what kind of game
[14:04:21] <eddyb> arnpro: you can add functionality on creation
[14:04:24] <arnpro> eddyb: I don't wan't the stage to be contained within the JS, just the functionality that can be attached to every div with .stage class
[14:04:31] <eddyb> uhm, why?
[14:04:35] <eddyb> that sounds a bit silly
[14:05:12] <innociv> I'm sending $socketframe[0].contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({"name":name,"data":data}), "*");   on the receiving the message it has ev.data set to "{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}" which gives an error when parsing it.  What's hte deal there?..
[14:05:14] <eddyb> having game data in HTML, that is
[14:05:16] <arnpro> oo, that's what I thought was best way, really. so how would it be? have like a main JS class that instances all the stages of the games? rendering them aswell? like .append() to the body
[14:05:40] <eddyb> arnpro: only if you show me some current code
[14:05:51] <arnpro> eddyb: I will, let me fiddle it
[14:05:53] <eddyb> you're using jsFiddle/a public server, are you?
[14:05:59] <eddyb> *aren't
[14:06:05] <eddyb> midnight grammar :)
[14:06:52] <innociv> It doesn't seem to be escaping it right
[14:07:23] <sunbeam> any idea how come this doesnt work:
[14:07:27] <sunbeam> if($(this).attr("name") == "email" AND !emailReg.test($(this).attr("value"))) { alert("test"); }
[14:07:32] <sunbeam> and var emailReg = /^([\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/;
[14:07:43] <eddyb> innociv: how are you parsing it?
[14:07:53] <innociv> JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[14:08:05] <eddyb> and it is escaping it right, you're using the wrong kind of quotes
[14:08:24] <innociv> Eh? It should make them \" automatically
[14:08:26] <eddyb> console.log(fail, JSON.parse(fail))
[14:08:28] <eddyb> innociv: no
[14:08:33] <innociv> No?
[14:08:45] <eddyb> JSON.parse('{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}')
[14:09:08] <innociv> Yeah that works but I thought JSON.stringify escapes quotes.
[14:09:10] <eddyb> put console.log(fail, JSON.parse(fail)) in the code, then look in the console (Ctrl+Shift+J if you're on chrome)
[14:09:21] <eddyb> innociv: if they're inside a string
[14:09:28] <innociv> Oh
[14:09:39] <eddyb> you don't escape quotes that are supposed to be quotes
[14:09:50] <foo> http://x03.ath.cx/temp/kk.php - on this page, the background changes to represent different locations that this company has. When the background changes, it changes in the footer as well (it highlights the location of the office) - I can't figure out what is responsible for changing the links in the footer? I know the footer li items get a class of "here" added. Can anyone help narrow this down?
[14:10:19] <sunbeam> eddyb: any idea what i do wrong?
[14:11:11] <innociv> That's so weird, to have to use single quotes.
[14:12:28] <eddyb> innociv: ....
[14:12:37] <innociv> What?
[14:12:43] <innociv> {"foo":"bar"} is a proper object.
[14:12:54] <eddyb> it's actually better to use single quotes, because you can distinguish them much easier
[14:13:03] <innociv> Distingiush them from what?
[14:13:08] <eddyb> pffft
[14:13:11] <eddyb> " is visual noise
[14:13:14] <eddyb> " ''
[14:13:50] <eddyb> the one on the left is one double quote, and on the right there's two single quotes
[14:13:52] <eddyb> "" ''
[14:14:02] <eddyb> two empty strings, which is easier to spot?
[14:14:18] <chilversc> eddyb: I find "" pretty easy to spot, I mean what else can it be?
[14:14:18] <innociv> "" because who would put 4 single quotes in a row?
[14:14:31] <smplstk> are we talkin' objects or json?
[14:14:36] <chilversc> eddyb: plus I just recognise "" as an empty string, well, except when it isn't
[14:15:05] <Jon47> 4 single quotes in a row might even be a parse error
[14:15:21] <smplstk> eval ''''
[14:15:22] <caniuse> smplstk: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected string'
[14:15:29] <smplstk> eval ''+''
[14:15:30] <caniuse> smplstk: ''
[14:15:52] <eddyb> see, that's tricky, unless you always use single quotes
[14:15:55] <innociv> JSON.stringify({'name':'bar','data':'foo'})  is making "{"name":"bar","data":"foo"}"
[14:15:56] <innociv> wtf?
[14:16:09] <eddyb> innociv: do you actually know how objects work?
[14:16:12] <smplstk> innociv: look at the json spec
[14:16:27] <eddyb> JS allows single quotes, double quotes or no quotes
[14:16:31] <eddyb> JSON requires double quotes
[14:16:33] <Jon47> i think getting really strict on what types of quotes one should use is probably a misuse of energy
[14:16:39] <innociv> I'm using single quotes there like you said
[14:16:48] <innociv> it's making them doubles in JSON.stringify
[14:16:51] <eddyb> eval JSON.stringify({name:'foo'})
[14:16:51] <caniuse> eddyb: '{"name":"foo"}'
[14:16:52] <smplstk> ...
[14:17:06] <StudentRik> hi, im trying to use toggle on a div which holds google maps and when i press the submit button for a search the tiles on the map dont all show up, is there a way to hide the div until the search button is clicked and then show the whole map div ?
[14:17:08] <eddyb> innociv: because that's how it's supposed to work
[14:17:09] <smplstk> caniuse++
[14:17:19] <eddyb> the question is
[14:17:29] <eddyb> innociv: why were you putting double quotes around a JSON string?
[14:17:34] <innociv> I'm not
[14:17:36] <innociv> firebug is
[14:17:41] <innociv> or stringify
[14:17:47] <innociv> Where am I putting double quotes around it?
[14:17:56] <innociv> eval JSON.stringify({'name':'bar','data':'foo'})
[14:17:56] <caniuse> innociv: '{"name":"bar","data":"foo"}'
[14:18:06] <chilversc> firebug always displays strings with " around them
[14:18:11] <smplstk> YOU DON'T PUT QUOTES AROUND THE KEY
[14:18:25] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: stop shouting
[14:18:26] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this, $(this).attr("value") ?
[14:18:33] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: ;)
[14:18:33] <sunbeam> i would like to get the value of a input field
[14:18:40] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: and there is nothing wrong with quoting the keys
[14:18:41] <lathan> sunbeam, that there is a shortcut: .val()
[14:18:43] <eddyb> I quote innociv: "{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}"
[14:18:50] <sunbeam> lathan: thanks
[14:18:52] <eddyb> he out double quotes around a JSON string
[14:18:55] <eddyb> *put
[14:18:55] <innociv> That's what firebug said
[14:18:59] <innociv> I didn't put them there. Christ
[14:19:05] <eddyb> report it as a bug, then
[14:19:07] <innociv> eval JSON.stringify({name:'bar',data:'foo'})
[14:19:08] <caniuse> innociv: '{"name":"bar","data":"foo"}'
[14:19:20] <eddyb> actually, no
[14:19:21] <innociv> Kay I'm getting a json parse error either way
[14:19:27] <chilversc> innociv: firebug always displays strings with "" around them, its just a display/formatting thing
[14:19:33] <innociv> eval JSON.stringify({name:"bar",data:"foo"})
[14:19:33] <caniuse> innociv: '{"name":"bar","data":"foo"}'
[14:19:41] <innociv> ...
[14:19:41] <eddyb> innociv: console.log(failingString, JSON.parse(failingString))
[14:19:44] <innociv> That's the same thing
[14:19:55] <eddyb> ok, chrome's console is doing the same stupid thing
[14:19:58] <sunbeam> lathan: $(this).val() ?
[14:19:59] <innociv> The thing is
[14:19:59] <snover> it‚Äôs not stupid
[14:20:01] <eddyb> just copy what's inside the quotes
[14:20:03] <innociv> it's only failing in postMessage
[14:20:07] <snover> it is a string with quotation marks in the string
[14:20:08] <lathan> sunbeam, yes, and you can set with .val(newVal)
[14:20:20] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: you don't _have_ to, is what I should have shoutedn't
[14:20:21] <eddyb> and don't use the string with the quotes around it as a valid string
[14:20:47] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: you don't need to shout it though.
[14:20:58] <eddyb> eval console.log(JSON.stringify({name:'bar',data:'foo'}))
[14:20:58] <caniuse> eddyb: null
[14:21:18] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: I like shouting.
[14:21:32] <lathan> lol
[14:21:33] <ryanneufeld> ?dbad
[14:21:40] <lathan> bot-t is offline again
[14:21:42] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[14:21:42] <innociv> Ugh
[14:21:44] <innociv> It's parsing fine
[14:21:47] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: don't be a dick
[14:21:48] <innociv> but it's still making this error.
[14:21:56] <lathan> eval console.log({name:'bar',data:'foo'})
[14:21:56] <caniuse> lathan: null
[14:21:56] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: NO U
[14:22:06] <eddyb> innociv: what error?
[14:22:12] <lathan> eval JSON.stringify({name:'bar',data:'foo'});
[14:22:13] <caniuse> lathan: '{"name":"bar","data":"foo"}'
[14:22:22] <innociv> JSON.parse: unexpected character
[14:22:26] <ryanneufeld> welcome to ignore smplstk
[14:22:40] <eddyb> innociv: console.log the string you're sending to JSON.parse
[14:22:44] <smplstk> guys, eval on the bot in a query window
[14:23:00] <RyanD> Sorry about the massive c+p earlier! Anyways, I'm having issues with Themeroller, IE, within themeroller, the "button" classes function properly, but in the downloaded demo page and within existing pages of mine when I load jqueryUI, they use default styling. Any assistance?
[14:23:35] <RyanD> http://goo.gl/uOlty
[14:23:35] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/6cdJ3vCu
[14:23:55] <smplstk> <3 ryanneufeld
[14:24:07] <innociv> When two windows are opened, on the first window it says JSON.parse: unexpected character on line 61.
[14:24:17] <sunbeam> doesn't jquery have an AND selector?
[14:24:30] <eddyb> sunbeam: AND is default XD
[14:24:55] <eddyb> innociv: and what's the strings sent to JSON.parse?
[14:25:30] <eddyb> sunbeam: $('.foo.bar') will match elements with both foo and bar classes
[14:25:32] <innociv> '{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}' apparently
[14:25:42] <innociv> It says 	"{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}" in firebug but it should be 	'{"name":"testEvent","data":{"foo":"bar"}}'
[14:26:01] <sunbeam> eddyb: else if ($(this).attr("name") == "email" AND (!emailReg.test($(this).attr("value")))) { .. }
[14:26:04] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[14:26:14] <eddyb> pffft
[14:26:23] <eddyb> that's JS (JavaScript)
[14:26:31] <eddyb> i.e. the language you are currently using
[14:26:36] <sunbeam> eddyb: or,  else if ($(this).attr("name") == "email" AND !emailReg.test($(this).attr("value"))) { .. }
[14:26:48] <sunbeam> eddyb: but i mean, syntax wise whats wrong with it
[14:26:49] <eddyb> and AND is just a stupid way of saying &&, in PHP
[14:26:56] <eddyb> or in Python, IIRC
[14:27:04] <sunbeam> so i should use && here?
[14:27:07] <eddyb> yes
[14:27:35] <eddyb> PHP makes for dumb devs, including FB ones
[14:27:40] <eddyb> sunbeam: no offense
[14:27:48] <eddyb> I've been having some problems with FB's API
[14:27:54] <sunbeam> lol
[14:27:55] <smplstk> you can't blame a language for people being dumb...
[14:27:55] <ryanneufeld> eddyb: I take offence to that
[14:28:03] <ryanneufeld> I'm not as think you dumb I am
[14:28:08] <sunbeam> eddyb: whats wrong with FB
[14:28:10] <eddyb> must be the PHP levels in their blood
[14:28:17] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: you were silly enough to ignore me
[14:28:20] <innociv> Need to learn the operands.
[14:28:21] <smplstk> supposedly.
[14:28:25] <lathan> eddyb++
[14:28:25] <eddyb> sunbeam: some of their API has been broken for months
[14:28:46] <sunbeam> oh
[14:28:53] <smplstk> FaceBook is just plain broken as a general rule of thumb.
[14:29:26] <eddyb> I mean, it doesn't do as advertised, people reported it on their bug tracker, hasn't been looked at
[14:29:37] <eddyb> or their code is too much of a mess (more likely)
[14:29:38] <sunbeam> eddyb: but without kidding, is this a major issue?
[14:29:46] <eddyb> which part?
[14:29:53] <eddyb> the broken API?
[14:29:54] <sunbeam> eddyb: the broken API
[14:29:55] <sunbeam> yea
[14:30:08] <eddyb> it's the facebook home page feed
[14:30:15] <sunbeam> and they don't fix it?
[14:30:30] * smplstk changes topic to #facebook, ask all your facebook related questions here :S
[14:31:00] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: they may have already fixed it, but when you have over 250k severs
[14:31:05] <ryanneufeld> it can take a while :p
[14:31:17] <eddyb> it just gives back at most 200 results, and considering many of them aren't useful to me, so, yeah...
[14:31:34] <eddyb> and it's not even a hard limit, it just has moodswings
[14:31:46] <eddyb> it's supposed to give all the data in the last month
[14:31:57] <eddyb> but a couple of days isn't a month
[14:32:01] <sunbeam> I know someone well thats a major dev in fb, i can pass it to him
[14:32:01] <eddyb> </fb:rant>
[14:32:07] <sunbeam> but i highly doubt he has time for it lol
[14:32:41] <anli__> Is it possible for a div to get the same border as a select?
[14:32:45] <anli__> 3d style
[14:32:53] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know of something like BBQ but that is maintained and written using a brain ?
[14:32:58] <eddyb> anli__: #ccs
[14:33:10] <eddyb> try searching something on -webkit-appeareance
[14:33:19] <eddyb> or use an UI library which can do that
[14:34:13] <sunbeam> eddyb: you gotta wonder what front-end devs they have, i'm more a noob, but some of their js code doesn't look that smooth
[14:34:30] <eddyb> I thought it was compressed :P
[14:35:12] <smplstk> KWhat_Work: WAT
[14:35:20] <smplstk> jQuery BBQ?
[14:36:05] <KWhat_Work> smplstk: yes jquery bbq http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin
[14:36:06] <eddyb> there's a thing called masonry, so, yeah, the kitchen sinks are taken
[14:36:20] <KWhat_Work> looking for something that handles parameters correctly
[14:37:00] <smplstk> KWhat_Work: BBQ is one of the best, if not _the_ best deeplinking JS lib
[14:37:11] <sunbeam> eddyb: also, you think using css !important a million times is a good practice?
[14:37:34] <smplstk> KWhat_Work: I can assure you that ben_alman has a brain
[14:37:35] <KWhat_Work> smplstk: cant parse urls though,  it assumes that they are always in #var1=val1&var2=val2
[14:37:44] * smplstk winks at ben_alman
[14:38:13] <innociv> I added console log and it logs the parsed JSON string just fine
[14:38:15] <innociv> but still makes the error
[14:38:17] <smplstk> KWhat_Work: are you just looking to do pushState?
[14:38:20] <eddyb> sunbeam: I only used it once, just for masonry, because it sets a different width
[14:38:53] <sunbeam> eddyb: was referring to fb
[14:39:15] <sunbeam> eddyb: masonry is your plugin?
[14:39:18] <KWhat_Work> smplstk: doing a push state with something like #some/path?item1=val1&item2=val2 so I end up with  #some/path?item1=val1&item2=some/path?item1=val1&item2=val2
[14:39:23] <innociv> The odd thing is
[14:39:29] <innociv> that that frame shouldn't even be receiving the message
[14:39:48] <eddyb> sunbeam: no, I'm using it, and I had to use !important to overwrite something it does with the width
[14:40:11] <eddyb> but FB doesn't have external JS like that, so no reason to use !important
[14:40:40] <KWhat_Work> its really the querystring function that is a heap of shit
[14:40:49] <sunbeam> obv debug purposes but would say will all those 10s of frontend-devs they would clean up such stuff
[14:40:57] <sunbeam> s/will/with
[14:40:58] <SmashingX> hey guys in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/41/ what else can I use instead of the second line of code which my server is ignoring for some reason
[14:41:08] <nFF> What is the difference between pushstate and bbq?
[14:41:17] <KWhat_Work> well its not a heap of shit it just makes an assumption that all data after the hash is an & delaminated key val pair
[14:41:33] <KWhat_Work> which makes it very useless to me
[14:41:40] <systemfault> nFF: You don't invite friends to a pushstate? (
[14:41:42] <systemfault> :/
[14:42:29] <smplstk> KWhat_Work: why would you want a "/" in there? I don't get even...
[14:42:41] <KWhat_Work> smplstk: i am loading a panel
[14:42:53] <KWhat_Work> with html data
[14:44:02] <eddyb> well, if you want a path, you should have it in the history push state thing...
[14:44:11] <eddyb> oh, it's the fall-back that's failing?
[14:44:49] <sunbeam> === is the same as != ?
[14:45:07] <systemfault> TIAS? :/ But no..
[14:45:08] <nFF> :|
[14:45:19] <systemfault> === compare types and value without coercion.
[14:45:27] <systemfault> != means.. not equal
[14:45:36] <sunbeam> coercion. what it means
[14:45:39] <nFF> KWhat_Work, can't you pass the path as a key/val pair to get around it?
[14:45:55] <systemfault> sunbeam: casting.. transforming the type of a variable to another...
[14:46:01] <systemfault> ?eval "1" == 1
[14:46:01] <caniuse> systemfault: true
[14:46:07] <systemfault> ?eval "1" === 1
[14:46:08] <caniuse> systemfault: false
[14:46:14] <systemfault> That's the difference.
[14:46:31] <KWhat_Work> nFF: probably but then my backend has to do alot more work.
[14:46:44] <nFF> KWhat_Work, yea youd have to parse it on the backend
[14:47:06] <nFF> but if you cant pass it how you want, what other choice do you have?
[14:47:13] <nFF> (i don't even know what you are doing)
[14:47:17] <KWhat_Work> rewrite it without the assumption
[14:48:07] <KWhat_Work> nFF: basicaly i have #some/path/to/a/real/page?page=1&filter=*  and i want to update the filter.
[14:48:18] <KWhat_Work> page is optional
[14:48:37] <nFF> Ok and your doing this via ajax and pushstate?
[14:48:37] <eddyb> sunbeam: wait, you used PHP and not ===?
[14:48:44] <KWhat_Work> yah
[14:48:50] <eddyb> then again, you didn't know about &&...
[14:49:08] <andr0id> solved my problem another way :D
[14:49:30] <KWhat_Work> i could manually process all the params but then why use  bbq
[14:49:43] <nFF> Yea sorry not even sure what bbq is
[14:49:45] <sunbeam> eddyb: i use js
[14:49:48] <systemfault> Ahhh‚Ä¶ PHP programmers...
[14:50:02] <eddyb> sunbeam: you sounded like you were using PHP before
[14:50:18] <nFF> KWhat_Work, there is another plugin: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[14:50:26] <nFF> not sure if its any help
[14:51:10] <SmashingX> hey guys in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/41/ what else can I use instead of the second line of code which my server is ignoring for some reason
[14:51:51] <nFF> ?on @ SmashingX
[14:51:51] <caniuse> SmashingX: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:52:09] <KWhat_Work> ill dig though it thanks
[14:53:07] <SmashingX> nFF: It doesn't work for Jquery 1.3.2
[14:53:30] <nFF> KWhat_Work, but you can always just write your own pushstate and ajax requests
[14:53:36] * shoky sighs
[14:54:03] <nFF> KWhat_Work, or depending on the license change some of bbq's source so it works for you :D
[14:54:24] <nFF> SmashingX, is that why you included 1.7.1 on the left?! :D
[14:54:28] <KWhat_Work> nFF thats probably what i am going to end up doing
[14:54:40] <KWhat_Work> after rolling my own form widgets I never ever want to do that again
[14:54:54] <nFF> I really don't know what bbq is, or how it differs from PJAX
[14:54:56] <SmashingX> nFF I just switched to see if that would work on that version
[14:55:14] <SmashingX> (":checkbox").on is not a function
[14:55:26] <shoky> SmashingX you have been asking that same question for like a week now
[14:55:30] <blindMoe> SmashingX: try .live()
[14:55:32] <shoky> stop it
[14:55:34] <SmashingX> so?
[14:55:42] <SmashingX> I've been able to solve it
[14:55:47] <SmashingX> what do you want me to do?
[14:55:54] <shoky> ask what you want for
[14:56:10] <shoky> dont ask for something, make us answer you, then ask for something completely different saying the first solution doesnt work
[14:56:12] <shoky> jesus
[14:56:45] <SmashingX> I have the code
[14:56:51] <SmashingX> I've tried different options
[14:56:53] <SmashingX> nothing..
[14:56:54] <shoky> if you wanted it to work in 1.3.2 why the hell didn't you say that
[14:56:57] <shoky> with your first question
[14:57:03] <shoky> not after someone already worked out an answer for you
[14:57:09] <SmashingX> first of all I din't know it changed with versions
[14:57:15] <shoky> you're repeating the same thing every dya
[14:57:26] <shoky> of course you did because you got the same answers already a few times
[14:57:35] <shoky> about .on()
[14:57:41] <SmashingX> that doesn't even matter dude, I just changed the names of the functions to the old versions and that was the fix
[14:57:44] <shoky> and before that it was a different on
[14:57:45] <shoky> one
[14:58:33] <SmashingX> I wish I can ask different questions every day but if I can get to the next step how can I go ahead if I'm stuck?
[14:58:38] <shoky> hint: EVERYTHING changes with versions
[14:58:53] <systemfault> SmashingX: Migrate to the latest version?
[14:58:57] <systemfault> FTFY
[14:59:00] <shoky> you'll keep being stuck if you dont ask for exactly what you need
[14:59:04] <SmashingX> srly?
[14:59:05] <shoky> instead of something totally different
[14:59:07] <SmashingX> rly?
[14:59:11] <SmashingX> I din't know that!!
[14:59:42] <SmashingX> systemfault: I can't upgrade so I have to fix it with the version I have
[14:59:50] <SmashingX> I will do more work
[15:00:09] <Madrid1980> hi I've used a jcarousel on my site but for some reason I can't get the css to in the right column to make the li items spaced out right, whatever I try they all seem to be bunched up. Can anyone please help? http://www.eborselfpublishing.co.uk/
[15:00:24] <David_Bradbury> I'm using '$(window).on("resize", function(e)...', and it is telling me that "resize" is not a function. I've also heard it is better to use 'on' than $().resize in case you're wondering why I'm not using that
[15:00:47] <David_Bradbury> Madrid1980: That seems like more of a #css issue than a jQuery issue, you may have better luck there
[15:01:16] <SmashingX> What's the difference between live() on() and bind()?
[15:01:18] <shoky> ?paste @ David_Bradbury
[15:01:21] <SmashingX> just the version?
[15:01:24] <shoky> no
[15:01:37] <Madrid1980> David_Bradbury:  Hi thanks yeah it does seem to be... I've asked in css irc also but just hoped maybe someone else here might have an insight
[15:01:57] <arnpro> SmashingX: what are you trying to accomplish? ... in the fiddle...
[15:02:03] <David_Bradbury> shoky, that's pretty much the whole code. I can put together an example if you like.
[15:02:18] <shoky> David_Bradbury: an example reproducing the issue, sure
[15:02:26] <SmashingX> arnpro: nothing I just got the answer... it was use live() instead of bind() and on()
[15:02:49] <SmashingX> But I was just wondering why it made a difference when I use live instead of bind
[15:03:00] <shoky> because they are different
[15:03:08] <nFF> David_Bradbury
[15:03:09] <nFF> http://jsfiddle.net/QvDzQ/
[15:03:13] <nFF> i made an example for you
[15:03:20] <cool-RR> Hello
[15:03:27] <cool-RR> Hello
[15:03:29] <rapha> Why don't selectors find elements that have been brought into the page with .load() and how can you fix that?
[15:03:41] <shoky> sure they do
[15:03:48] <nFF> ?delegation @ rapha
[15:03:57] <nFF> :<
[15:04:03] <cool-RR> I want to make an interface like Google Calendar has, where you can drag from one cell in a table to another one, and based on the range that you've dragged, do some action
[15:04:07] <SmashingX> just like that shoky?
[15:04:08] <cool-RR> Does anyone know how to do that?
[15:04:12] <SmashingX> they are different?
[15:04:27] <rapha> nFF: sorry?
[15:04:38] <shoky> SmashingX: is there anything in the docs about .bind() or .live() you don't understand ?
[15:04:42] <rapha> nFF: what to delegate to whom?
[15:04:43] <shoky> i'd be happy to explain
[15:04:57] <nFF> rapha are you trying to bind events to elements that are added to the page via .load() @?
[15:05:04] <systemfault> rapha: CSS selectors work just fine with .load'ed content‚Ä¶ but all the bound event handlers are killed
[15:05:15] <David_Bradbury> Ignore me guys, I'm an idiot :)
[15:05:28] <rapha> nFF: systemfault: i just realized load() doesn't seem to be the problem, but the fact that i load()'ed into a dialog()...
[15:05:34] <shoky> next time just fiddle before asking ;)
[15:06:19] <rapha> systemfault: how can you get the event handlers to reattach?
[15:06:23] <SmashingX> shoky: no, Im sure you wont
[15:06:39] <shoky> you didn't even ask
[15:06:54] <systemfault> rapha: You must do it manually after the .load OR use event delegation instead of traditional event handling.
[15:07:02] <nFF> ?event.delegation @ rapha
[15:07:06] <systemfault> rapha: I suggest the latter.
[15:07:15] <nFF> oh no bot :|
[15:07:43] <systemfault> rapha: You can do event delegation with .live/.delegate or with the newer .on (I suggest you use that one because the others are being deprecated)
[15:07:46] <SmashingX> <shoky> next time just fiddle before asking ;) <--- talking to me?
[15:08:01] <rapha> systemfault: i'm on 1.7.2 so on will do fine
[15:08:15] <nFF> rapha, you bind to the closest parent thats on dom load: $('.parent').on('click', '.target-child-element', function() {});
[15:08:57] <rapha> nFF: okay that makes sense ... so in my case the div that is being used for .dialog()
[15:08:59] <systemfault> rapha: Then just one thing with .on‚Ä¶ it can be confusing because you can do both normal event handling and event delegation with it‚Ä¶ you want $(parentElement).on('eventName', 'selectorHere', function(e) {});
[15:09:29] <shoky> SmashingX: $(elements).bind('click', ...) binds an event handler to the elements in 'elements'. $(elements).live('click', ...)  binds events NOT to 'elements' but it binds to the document element (delegates the event handling to the document)
[15:09:37] <shoky> SmashingX: no i wasn't talking to you there
[15:09:53] <SmashingX> k
[15:09:56] <rapha> systemfault: now another problem ... the page in question may be called on it's own, too ... should i just bind two events then?
[15:10:21] <systemfault> rapha: That's weird.. not sure if I get it.
[15:10:27] <rapha> systemfault: (i.e. if its called on its own it'll have its own <html> and so forth, and when it's called through XMLHttpRequest it won't)
[15:11:09] <nFF> thats bad code design :D
[15:11:12] <SmashingX> shoky : so live() is more general?
[15:11:20] <SmashingX> shoky: But it does the same action
[15:11:50] <systemfault> SmashingX: Read on "event bubbling" and after "Event delegation" if you really care.
[15:12:20] <rapha> nFF: that's my coworker killing me
[15:12:21] <nFF> rapha, usually your server would return exactly what you need, rather then just whole html pages
[15:12:36] <shoky> SmashingX: its not more general, they do different things as i explained
[15:13:08] <rapha> nFF: i'm working with Rails so it's really just a question of adding a layout or leaving it out. and the use case does justify it, as much as i hate my coworker for making me do it.
[15:13:32] <nFF> ahh blame the oh so illusive 'coworker' :D
[15:14:14] <nFF> rapha, simply have one event bind using on
[15:14:39] <nFF> or on the direct binding return false
[15:14:40] <SmashingX> how can I add comments to jquery just like HTML? //?
[15:14:57] <rapha> nFF: his name is Andy and he's quite real ;-)
[15:15:01] <shoky> SmashingX: jquery is javascript
[15:15:04] <shoky> not HTML
[15:15:17] <SmashingX> I know is not HTML
[15:15:25] <SmashingX> but I was wondering if it would be about the same
[15:15:27] <rapha> nFF: i think i'll check for the div that is used for the dialog() in the normal use case and then write such or such an event handler based on that. thanks!
[15:15:35] <arnpro> SmashingX: the // and /* */ will work
[15:15:40] <shoky> that's an odd thing to wonder
[15:15:42] <SmashingX> so then like HTML
[15:15:47] <SmashingX> thanks
[15:15:47] <shoky> no, not like HTML
[15:15:50] <arnpro> no no
[15:15:53] <xec> SmashingX: you can't comment in html with // or /*
[15:15:55] <aphid> SmashingX // comments do not work in html.
[15:15:58] <SmashingX> oh yeah
[15:15:59] <arnpro> SmashingX: HTML is <!-- -->
[15:16:02] <SmashingX> you're right
[15:16:05] <nFF> :DD
[15:16:07] <SmashingX> I forgot yeah thanks
[15:16:19] <systemfault> o_O
[15:16:19] <RyanD> so, I'm having issues with themeroller on jQuery UI. http://goo.gl/uOlty the button works in the live HTML demo, but when you download the theme, the button styling no longer works, even in the downloaded demo page.
[15:17:34] <SmashingX> I should have said like C/Java/Javascript
[15:18:10] <shoky> or you should have googled/read elsewhere
[15:18:12] <xec> SmashingX: jquery is not a language, so you do not comment in jquery
[15:18:22] <xec> SmashingX: you comment in javascript
[15:18:30] <SmashingX> got ya
[15:18:36] <shoky> how do you comment in IRC?!?!
[15:18:40] <SmashingX> I did shoky
[15:18:44] <xec> lol
[15:18:51] <shoky> u did me long time
[15:18:56] <xec> shoky: i think you just did
[15:19:03] <shoky> owww
[15:19:05] <SmashingX> but there's a lot of information in how to comment in blogs jquery and stupid things like that
[15:19:29] <shoky> oks
[15:19:54] <arnpro> SmashingX: you can always use jsfiddle to test whatever you're working on, works excellent, trials & error works best
[15:20:09] <SmashingX> shoky: getting mad it's bad for your liver :D
[15:20:26] <arnpro> lol
[15:20:30] <shoky> SmashingX: then think before you talk :)
[15:20:39] <shoky> if you're worried for my liver, that is
[15:20:39] * xec punches shoky in the liver
[15:20:42] <SmashingX> arnpro: I did but for some odd reason the example worked in jsfiddle but not on my page
[15:20:55] <shoky> anyway i just have a headache, sorry for any foulness
[15:21:05] <SmashingX> I'm not saying Im worried about your liver, Im just giving you a suggestion
[15:21:26] <innociv> Okay
[15:21:31] * shoky farts on xec's soul
[15:21:44] <xec> aaargh! not my SOUL!!
[15:21:49] <innociv> That issue earlier. I made a fiddle.  http://jsfiddle.net/5bLfH/ Open this twice and you'll see "JSON.parse: unexpected character" in the original window.  Can someone please help me figure out what's going wrong here?
[15:21:51] <SmashingX> so this is the thing: the example using ,bind() worked on jsfiddle but it didn't work on my server, on my server worked using .live()
[15:21:55] <shoky> hi saul
[15:22:09] * aphid smacks shoky's liver with a large stout
[15:22:16] <SmashingX> so whatever was happening it was weird
[15:22:19] <sunbeam> in fancybox there is a function loading() defined which cannot be found
[15:22:19] * shoky belch
[15:22:30] <aphid> stout, trout, whatever
[15:22:32] <sunbeam> does anyone know where this loading() function is defined? not in fancybox js
[15:22:40] <SmashingX> beer?
[15:22:49] <rapha> systemfault: inside that .on() "this" does not seem to be the same "this" as it is inside .click() ... how do I get to the "this" that represents the child element, not the parent?
[15:22:50] <SmashingX> are you guys drunk already?
[15:23:09] <aphid> well, i just cracked a homebrew
[15:23:22] <systemfault> rapha: it should be :/
[15:23:27] <shoky> i m inebriated @ some substance, yes
[15:24:14] <rapha> systemfault: okay, maybe i just have a typo or something
[15:24:41] <systemfault> rapha: http://jsfiddle.net/TPtxB/
[15:25:13] <rapha> systemfault: hmm okay how can I debug "this"? alert(this) just says Object all the time ... is there something like print_r()?
[15:25:15] <xec> SmashingX: .bind() is not the same as .live() - but in any case they are both superceded by .on() so i suggest you read the documentation for .on() - while a bit lenghty it will explain a lot and is very handy to know well
[15:25:24] <systemfault> rapha: console.log(whatever)
[15:25:46] <rapha> systemfault: thx
[15:25:51] <SmashingX> xec: The version of jquery I have doesn't support .on()
[15:26:11] <xec> SmashingX: ok, then you need to upgrade first :D
[15:26:14] <systemfault> rapha: That will print the object inside the javascript console, don't expect a popup :)
[15:27:10] <innociv> Ah i got it
[15:29:30] <rapha> systemfault: that's actually so much more comfortable than all the alert()'ing i've been doing :-)
[15:29:44] <rapha> systemfault: could you take another look at http://jsfiddle.net/TPtxB/1/ if anything pops you in the eye?
[15:30:07] <xec> alert is much better if you want a popup that says [object Object] though
[15:30:20] <sunbeam> can anyone help me, how can i remove the last , of a string?
[15:30:24] <SmashingX> geez.. what part of I'm not upgrading is hard to understand?
[15:30:38] <sunbeam> if(result_updated == true) { result_fields = result_fields.replace(/,$/,''); }
[15:30:41] <sunbeam> this is what i use now
[15:30:47] <systemfault> rapha: The second param of .on should be a selector
[15:30:58] <xec> SmashingX: isn't it obvious? it is the "not" part
[15:31:01] <systemfault> rapha: Not a jquery object (It should be a string)
[15:31:06] <rapha> systemfault: by which you mean to remove the $()...
[15:31:10] <rapha> systemfault: yes!
[15:31:12] <systemfault> rapha: Yeah.
[15:31:18] <rapha> systemfault: worked, thanks a lot! :-)
[15:31:29] <systemfault> rapha: You're welcome :)
[15:31:32] <SmashingX> xec, It would take me months to upgrade so forget it
[15:32:09] <xec> wha
[15:32:37] <xec> it only took a fraction of a second to download last time i tried
[15:33:38] <SmashingX> yes but I don't have to only upgrade
[15:33:48] <SmashingX> I will have to move things around in myu server
[15:33:55] <nFF> lol
[15:33:57] <nFF> :>
[15:34:52] <shoky> months, i tell you!
[15:35:08] <xec> oh i see, you would need to hire someone to help you move things around, and maybe a van for the big stuff
[15:35:34] <nFF> I cant help but imagine your server probably contains httpdocs/index.html and nothing else :D
[15:36:05] <shoky> i heard jquery 1.3.2 came on fridge sized fridges
[15:36:11] <xec> SmashingX: i'm sorry, i sound like an asshole, i don't mean to be
[15:36:16] <nFF> lol
[15:36:27] <nFF> if we dont laugh, we will cry
[15:36:37] <SmashingX> it's ok
[15:37:04] <shoky> what things will you have to move around?
[15:39:05] <nFF> lol
[15:39:15] <nFF> hes kidding]
[15:39:22] <nFF> or trolling
[15:39:25] <nFF> i cant decide
[15:39:38] <xec> or lazy
[15:39:42] <xec> or incompetent
[15:39:49] <shoky> he's smashing
[15:41:17] <systemfault> zZz...
[15:41:58] <xec> have any of you ever had that dream where you're running and running but never get off the spot?
[15:42:26] <nFF> systemfault constantly has that dream
[15:42:30] <nFF> and reality also
[15:42:52] <nFF> just jokes
[15:43:00] <xec> i have waited like a decade for diablo3 now, all i want to do is log on and play single player, but noooooo the servers are busy ... the SERVERS for SINGLE PLAYER - really?
[15:43:00] <nFF> highlighted wrong person :D time for bed
[15:43:08] <systemfault> I wish, if it was the case, I wouldn't be overweight at the moment.
[15:44:18] <xec> systemfault: i think you just had the most brilliant idea ever - workout while sleeping! some sort of hypnotic trance, for lazy people
[15:44:48] <systemfault> Righhht!
[15:45:04] <systemfault> Would be fun for couples :/
[15:45:50] <xec> systemfault: you could do this for every chore, hypno-cooking!
[15:46:07] <xec> only be concious for the fun parts of life
[15:46:38] <friedbyte> how would one go about having an image that will swap in a video on click with jquery?
[15:47:10] <xec> friedbyte: what do you have so far? an image and a video?
[15:47:29] <friedbyte> yeah
[15:48:00] <xec> then you could just .toggle() the two, i guess
[15:48:17] <friedbyte> what would that look like?
[15:48:31] <systemfault> Whoa http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla
[15:48:38] <friedbyte> so when I click on the image, the image hides, and then the video appears?
[15:49:16] <xec> friedbyte: or most likely you don't want to change back so you could just do a simple .hide() on the image and .show() the video on .click()
[16:00:48] <xec> systemfault: i'm only about halfway through that link, but i got to say: holy shit
[16:01:02] <shoky> TeSLa
[16:01:18] <shoky> vs douchey
[16:01:49] <xec> indeed, that's just bat-shit crazy
[16:02:53] <aphid> see also - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_%28elephant%29
[16:03:00] <xiam> douchepickle
[16:05:01] <SmashingX> how can I disable a radiobutton?
[16:05:34] <SmashingX> or what I mean is that the user can change its value
[16:05:49] <xec> you mean uncheck?
[16:06:21] <xec> iirc its something like .prop("checked", false)
[16:06:30] <SmashingX> Im sorry
[16:06:35] <SmashingX> or what I mean is that the user can't change its value
[16:06:45] <SmashingX> to be clocked
[16:06:54] <SmashingX> damn, blocked
[16:07:01] <xiam> use the disabled="disabled" attribute
[16:07:32] <xec> .prop("disabled", true) perhaps?
[16:07:45] <SmashingX> my version doesn't support prop
[16:07:48] <xec> if you need to do it with javascript
[16:07:56] <SmashingX> yah with javascript
[16:08:11] <xec> SmashingX: have you tried upgrading jquery?
[16:08:19] <SmashingX> no
[16:08:23] <xec> oh
[16:08:25] <xec> why not?
[16:08:39] <SmashingX> so it's #CIVICRM_QFID_761_4.attr("disabled", true);
[16:08:45] <SmashingX> because it will give a lot of problems
[16:08:49] <SmashingX> believe me
[16:09:12] <xec> is that an ID?
[16:09:35] <SmashingX> yep
[16:09:54] <xec> SmashingX: ok. you can't call jquery methods on anythin except jquery objects
[16:09:55] <SmashingX> $('#CIVICRM_QFID_761_4').attr('disabled',true);
[16:10:00] <xec> thats more like it
[16:10:05] <SmashingX> ok
[16:10:19] <KWhat_Work> Ahh figured it out.  I didnt realize pushState had a second argument
[16:12:22] <friedbyte> xec: FYI: your suggestion worked perfectly!
[16:12:29] <xec> friedbyte: awesome :)
[16:13:24] <SmashingX> if the radiobuttons are disabled you can't get the values that you have in them?
[16:13:36] <SmashingX> or can you get wich ones are checked?
[16:15:10] <xec> you mean select?
[16:16:09] <SmashingX> right
[16:16:33] <xec> you can try :checked
[16:18:39] <SmashingX> I did
[16:18:54] <SmashingX> check my page
[16:18:58] <SmashingX> so you know what I mean
[16:19:20] <xec> url?
[16:19:26] <SmashingX> hold on
[16:20:58] <JTallis> Trying to make a jQuery plugin, however.. http://pastebin.com/2EMEUZ2m I'm needing to access the variable methods from inside a method. I also need to access various other variables defined outside of that object of methods. At the moment I get a "methods is not defined" error in the console. I am calling the init like... methods["init"].apply(this);
[16:21:06] <JTallis> what can I do that'll allow me to do what I want.
[16:21:22] <SmashingX> it seems like it's different when a user clicks on a radiobutton than when I say checked=true
[16:21:26] <shoky> don't use setTimeout with a string
[16:22:10] <JTallis> How would I write it iwthout using a string?  setTimeout(methods["update"].apply(this), 5000); ?
[16:22:16] <shoky> no
[16:22:27] <shoky> setTimeout( function() {  .... }, 5000 );
[16:22:40] <shoky> or: function myFunc() { .... };  setTimeout(myFunc, 5000);
[16:23:11] <superthebobfredm> Can someone help me figure out what's wrong with my script?  http://jsfiddle.net/36HxK/  I'm trying to clone the first div node, but it's cloning a whole bunch more....
[16:23:30] <superthebobfredm> Run the jsfiddle, and then click on "Add another spec"
[16:23:53] <superthebobfredm> it *really* starts to get wonky when you click on it more than once
[16:24:24] <ajpiano> superthebobfredm: read about what first-child does
[16:24:25] <shoky> superthebobfredm: var el = $('div:first-child', $(this).closest('dd'));
[16:24:29] <shoky> ^
[16:24:42] <ajpiano> superthebobfredm: there is more than one div that's a "first-child" in that dd
[16:24:52] <JTallis> That seemed to have worked, shoky, thank you.
[16:24:56] <foo> http://x03.ath.cx/temp/kk.php - on this page, the background changes to represent different locations that this company has. When the background changes, it changes in the footer as well (it highlights the location of the office) - I can't figure out what is responsible for changing the links in the footer? I know the footer li items get a class of "here" added. Can anyone help narrow this down?
[16:25:32] <superthebobfredm> ajpiano: what selector am I wanting then?
[16:25:46] <superthebobfredm> i'm looking to get the first div sibling of the anchor
[16:26:28] <superthebobfredm> ohhhh
[16:26:29] <ajpiano> superthebobfredm: $(this).siblings("div").first()
[16:26:32] <JTallis> seems fine to me, foo
[16:26:58] <JTallis> oh wait, I see whaty ou mean, foo
[16:27:06] <superthebobfredm> ajpiano: perfect.  thanks!
[16:27:14] <foo> JTallis: thanks. the problem is when I add another image to the rotation, specifically, an image for the british virgin islands... it doesn't automatically highlight that one... and I'm not sure why
[16:27:20] <foo> JTallis: thanks for looking
[16:28:29] <SmashingX> can I specify what radiobutton I want to disabled based on the label'
[16:28:44] <shoky> foo: look at the top of your page source..
[16:28:54] <shoky>  {image : "/images/css/new-york.jpg", title: "New York"},
[16:29:03] <foo> shoky: yes, what about it?
[16:29:09] <shoky> it has one of those for each city, but nothing for British Birgin Islands
[16:29:10] <shoky> ..
[16:29:21] <foo> shoky: how does that say "add 'here' class to the li in the footer" ?
[16:29:33] <foo> shoky: I can add it, it won't work properly. hmmm, let me do that to show ya
[16:30:53] <JTallis> your supersize plugin would probably take care of that, foo
[16:31:36] <foo> JTallis: ahh, how do you know?
[16:31:54] <shoky> that's what plugins do
[16:31:54] <foo> shoky: added it, doesn't go highlight it , though
[16:32:42] <foo> shoky: not sure what I did wrong, but it doesn't automatically select it and I can't find where it's coded. hmm
[16:33:43] <shoky> what da hell does this line do:  if(url.indexOf("") > -1) {$("#nav-sub-").addClass("here");}
[16:33:57] <dust--> Hi, I am new to jQuery - how is it possible in a cross browser compatible way to save dom elements with jquery server side?
[16:34:11] <foo> shoky: I saw that too... I think it's for the main nav. Or, are you implying, that's what it is I want to change?
[16:34:32] <foo> (I doubt the latter)
[16:35:02] <foo> JTallis: I added a British Virgin Islands location but it still has the problem
[16:35:09] <foo> ahh
[16:35:18] <shoky> foo: i have no idea what url.indexOf("") is
[16:35:57] <foo> shoky / JTallis - nevermind, I think I got it
[16:36:13] <shoky> also there's nothing with id 'nav-sub-'
[16:42:01] <scr3am> shoky: a crazy way to test if array is empty? does that make any sense?
[16:43:12] <shoky> no?
[16:48:55] <Parhs> hello guys! I use jqueryUI datepicker..  I want to mark somedays with my class .. this is dead easy.. The problem is in what format should the json array with the date intervals should be ?
[16:51:51] <sunbeam> the jquery nivoslider, is there some version of this slider where you can change the textual content of a certain <p> aswell with?
[16:54:25] <scr3am> Parhs: you can set the dateformat option, then i would assume in the same format...
[16:55:53] <Parhs> propably this is one solution..
[16:56:03] <Parhs> are array's hashed ?
[16:57:06] <scr3am> don't know...
[17:10:15] <brianfreud> Anyone know why $('<td/>').wrap($('<tr>')) gives <td/>?
[17:11:05] <brianfreud> same for $('<td/>').wrap('<tr>') and $('<td/>').wrap('<tr></tr>')
[17:11:06] <ajpiano> brianfreud: .wrap doesn't return the set
[17:11:19] <ajpiano> i mean, it doesn't return the wrapper
[17:11:25] <ajpiano> it returns the original elements
[17:11:34] <ajpiano> .wrap("whatever").parent() will do the trick
[17:11:50] <brianfreud> thanks
[17:12:07] <brianfreud> that seems inconsistent w/the typical API
[17:12:49] <tw2113> is it so just cloud, ajpiano ?
[17:12:58] <ajpiano> brianfreud: it's not really
[17:13:11] <ajpiano> consider the fact that $("#div").append("<foo>") returns div, not foo
[17:13:58] <brianfreud> I guess
[17:13:59] <brianfreud> :)
[17:14:25] <ajpiano> brianfreud: if you're creating it all at once
[17:14:37] <ajpiano> why wouldn't you just do $("<tr><td></td></tr>")
[17:15:25] <brianfreud> lol, atm, I'm just screwing around in the console to figure out the right bit to make the new eles I want; junk code that is far from what I'd use outside of the console :P
[17:15:31] <brianfreud> $('td > a[resource^="[mbz:release-group/"]').parents('tr:first').after($('<td/>').attr('colspan', 5).wrap('<tr>').parent())  :D
[17:16:13] <ajpiano> ?glwtd
[17:16:32] <shoky> > Good luck with that, dude.
[17:16:37] <brianfreud> lol
[17:17:05] <ajpiano> any time you have to start modifying the colspan of table cells on the fly
[17:17:15] <ajpiano> is a good time to sit back and reconsider what you are really doing
[17:17:18] <ajpiano> :p
[17:17:50] <brianfreud> It
[17:17:51] <tw2113> like making tables in general
[17:17:55] <brianfreud> It's a gm script :P
[17:18:22] <shoky> then hack away
[17:18:30] <brianfreud> heh
[17:21:19] <NCS_One> hi
[17:22:22] <brownies> trying to customize the pages that JQM auto-generates for nested lists -- any suggestions? is it possible at all?
[17:22:29] <NCS_One> shoudn't this line work? "$("#selectorId").hide("slide", {direction:"right"}, 1000);"
[17:22:31] <brownies> or have they just assumed that all nested lists everywhere will fit their narrow model?
[17:25:03] <Zachary> Hi
[17:25:25] <Zachary> I want to let page contents equal a variable
[17:25:41] <Zachary> variable = $.get('http://blahblah.com/stats/stats.php');
[17:25:53] <Zachary> this outputs an object, how do i make it show the contents?
[17:27:28] <gasull> I have a text input field with a checkbox next to it.  The user should either check the box ("i don't have a license") or fill the text input (license number).  How can I use jquerytools to validate that either the text input was filled or the checkbox was checked?

[17:52:32] <brianfreud> hey, the "musicbrainz" tag finally hit the front page tagcloud at userscripts :)
[17:57:53] <lordscarlet> Does anyone know anything about mousemove/mouseover skipping pixels -- it seems that if you move your mouse fast enough it does, but I need to track every pixel it crosses
[18:01:05] <shoky> the cursor doesn't neccesarily go through all the pixels on the way
[18:01:28] <lordscarlet> I don't see how that is possible
[18:01:40] <snover> because it‚Äôs sampled on an interval
[18:01:42] <shoky> it is digital
[18:01:54] <lordscarlet> k
[18:01:54] <snover> there are also pointer-absolute devices
[18:02:00] <snover> like tablets
[18:04:00] <lordscarlet> thanks
[18:04:32] <shoky> you can interpolate between the remote pixels though
[18:04:41] <lordscarlet> yeah, I was hoping to avoid that :)
[18:04:49] <shoky> ;P
[18:04:54] <lordscarlet> the distance it skips sometimes isn't even worth interpolating I don't think
[18:05:04] <shoky> depends what you're after
[18:05:14] <lordscarlet> I'm working on an ANSI editor
[18:05:22] <shoky> hah
[18:05:30] <lordscarlet> the drawing is so chunky to begin with it just doesn't seem worth interpolating
[18:05:43] <shoky> i suppose not
[18:05:44] <lordscarlet> but that is probably what I will end up trying
[18:05:50] <lordscarlet> and I can just see how it turns out
[18:05:50] <shoky> o

[18:35:18] <ciro_nunes> hey guys, why .serialize() method don't catch data from files?
[18:35:47] <coldhead> because files are "special"
[18:36:11] <coldhead> there are a bunch of things that don't work with <input type="file">
[18:36:14] <coldhead> this is another
[18:36:21] <coldhead> its very sad
[18:37:27] <ciro_nunes> oh yeah
[18:37:32] <ciro_nunes> i have this problem today
[18:38:07] <ciro_nunes> and I need to use File API
[18:38:12] <ciro_nunes> with polyfill
[18:38:47] <coldhead> i guess jquery isn't 100% file API compatible yet
[18:38:54] <coldhead> you'll have to do it yourself
[18:38:59] <coldhead> good luck
[18:39:19] <rich_> hello guys. how can i call a php function from jquery, i want to do all my php functions in one file   lets call it functions.php. In this file are many functions. how can i call a specific one from jquery? Or is it even posible? thanks
[18:39:53] <ciro_nunes> coldhead: I did
[18:41:00] <ciro_nunes> coldhead: but it's very painful. It could be a jQuery feature :p
[18:42:10] <coldhead> rich_: if you can make your functions run via a get request, as in functions.php?function=FUNCTION_TO_EXECUTE then you can make a .get() request via jQuery which will hit that URL and return the output for you
[18:42:21] <coldhead> ?get @ rich_
[18:42:21] <caniuse> rich_: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[18:43:31] <coldhead> damn you caniuse
[18:43:36] <coldhead> ?ajax.get
[18:44:43] <rich_> do you think i should make a switch case in the php  and when the it is functions.php?f=hello_word                 and then switch('$_GET[f]') is this a "good" way?
[18:45:07] <coldhead> yeah, that'll work
[18:45:18] <coldhead> bear in mind that you might need to handle additional vars
[18:45:46] <rich_> yes i need. and i neet POST vars :(
[18:46:11] <coldhead> that's okay, jquery will let you do both
[18:46:29] <coldhead> use ?post // and put the GET vars in the URL you send to
[18:46:35] <coldhead> ?post
[18:46:41] <coldhead> WORK WITH ME, CANIUSE
[18:46:59] <rich_> oh thats good. so i have a get and post at one time
[18:47:52] <coldhead> yup, no fear
[18:48:41] <rich_> Well, is this the way the "pros" do it? .post and send the function name with it? this sounds to me so "not a good style"
[18:49:51] <coldhead> the pros might balk at the coupling between your PHP and your JS
[18:50:07] <coldhead> as in you'd have to rename stuff in your JS if you rename something in yur PHP
[18:50:14] <coldhead> the "best practice" is probably to use a RESTful API
[18:50:20] <coldhead> which you should look up and consider
[18:50:37] <coldhead> but the real best practice is whatever solves your problem
[18:51:29] <NCS_One> hi
[18:51:53] <rich_> wont be this solution a performance issue in the future. lets say i have 200 functions in my functions.php which has this big swtich case?
[18:53:27] <NCS_One> I'm getting some content using ajax and on ajax success I want to slide out the old content and almost at the same time slide in the new content. Any plugin recommendations? I currently looking at scrollTo
[18:55:12] <covi> Hi all. I have a span definition in my html that is set to invisible. However I want it to become visible as long as the user hovers over it. How do I achieve this/
[18:55:52] <NCS_One> covi: doesn't css work?
[18:56:20] <covi> NCS_One: I don't know what's the normal way to do it with css
[18:58:09] <NCS_One> covi: #myspan:hover {visibility: visible;}
[19:00:47] <covi> NCS_One: thanks
[19:00:55] <NCS_One> np

[19:06:23] <chovy> anyone know how to get chrome to reload a form post? window.location.reload() is ignored in chrome.
[19:06:27] <chovy> http://chovy.dyndns.org/test/post.php
[19:14:32] <shoky> i doubt that's possibl
[19:14:32] <shoky> e
[19:14:54] <shoky> if you mean to get the same effect as manually reloading after subbmitting the form
[19:28:29] <rodd> Hi, am I missing something in this piece of code? http://pastebin.com/0GFgVN4W using newElements as context for the popover plugin selector doesn't seem to work
[19:30:24] <coldhead> wkmanire: you've been working with iorayne!
[19:30:33] <coldhead> it's all so clear to me now
[19:31:13] <wkmanire> coldhead: I have?
[19:31:34] <coldhead> according to twitter
[19:31:44] <wkmanire> Someone talked about me on twitter?
[19:31:58] <wkmanire> I haven't used twitter in a long time. I'm sure my account isn't even active anymore.
[19:31:59] <coldhead> http://twitter.com/#!/IORayne/status/201938942386388992
[19:32:00] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from IORayne: Had fun working with wkmanire to rewrite refheap's javascript. Learned a lot from him. Maybe we'll eventually rewrite it in cljs. ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/J6M69q
[19:32:04] <coldhead> that's not you?
[19:32:15] <wkmanire> ahh
[19:32:16] <wkmanire> Sure is.
[19:32:19] <coldhead> bam!
[19:32:22] <wkmanire> I didn't link Rayne with IORayne.
[19:32:23] <wkmanire> he he
[19:32:33] <coldhead> oh i struggled to recall his IRC name
[19:32:36] <coldhead> i knew it was a variant
[19:32:45] <coldhead> i'm glad we cleared this u[
[19:32:47] <coldhead> p
[19:33:13] <wkmanire> Yeah, That's why I keep popping in here.
[19:33:18] <wkmanire> Well, one of the reasons.
[19:33:40] <wkmanire> I was also working on something for another business.
[19:34:10] <coldhead> busy busy busy
[19:35:50] <wkmanire> coldhead: Too busy. Like I mentioned, I've been hanging out in #clojure quite a bit... so naturally I found refheap. Then Rayne bitched about his js a little so I took the bait.
[19:35:53] <wkmanire> :D
[19:54:24] <derpina_> hey
[19:56:05] <tw2113> welcome back rmurphey
[19:57:36] <coldhead> wkmanire: that's a beautiful story
[19:57:41] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[19:58:48] <tw2113> i keep showing up because apparently i want to keep learning more jquery
[19:59:30] <moldy84> So I have a page that uses a pageid passed into the url of index to determine page content. it does this by switching pageid in php and including the relevant content.  Here is my issue.  ajax does not run on first page load, i have to refresh before ajax will run like it should.  however if I click on links to other pages (through pageid) and have it open in a new tab it loads fine and runs the ajax first time.  any ideas why this happens?
[20:00:08] <wkmanire> coldhead: I do my best to be an inspiration of tragic proportions.
[20:01:23] <wkmanire> tw2113: Is it working?
[20:01:50] <tw2113> slowly
[20:03:49] <wkmanire> tw2113: Have you tried reading the source code yet? It's pretty well documented.
[20:04:22] <tw2113> i git cloned it once
[20:04:46] <coldhead> git pull
[20:05:10] <gf3> git push, baby
[20:05:18] <wkmanire> git a little bit of your love to me.
[20:06:15] <tw2113> too much git pulling and git pushing results in little clones that run around everywhere
[20:06:36] <defaultro> hey folks, i'm trying to get a dialog box to appear in jsfiddle.net. It's now showing up. What am I missing?
[20:06:40] <wkmanire> heh
[20:06:52] <wkmanire> defaultro: Context and a hyperlink.
[20:07:02] <gf3> defaultro: DID YOU TRY alert()???
[20:07:30] <defaultro> this is what I copied, jsfiddle.net/kVjxZ
[20:07:43] <gf3> WFM
[20:07:43] <caniuse> gf3: Works For Me
[20:08:12] <defaultro> I opened another firefox tab and copied the values. I don't see the dialog box. Weird
[20:08:42] <defaultro> on left, I chose jQuery 1.7.2 and checked jquery UI 1.8.18
[20:10:17] <defaultro> this is mine, very same code, jsfiddle.net/fvAY8
[20:10:21] <defaultro> that is very weird
[20:11:30] <defaultro> the text gets displayed but where is the dialog window, LOL
[20:11:50] <coldhead> i would just move to flash
[20:14:34] <Foxhoundz> .js
[20:14:37] <Foxhoundz> .js $
[20:15:03] <coldhead> looking good, meatbag
[20:15:13] <Foxhoundz> :)
[20:15:39] <rodd> am I missing something in this piece of code? http://pastebin.com/0GFgVN4W using newElements as context for the popover plugin selector doesn't seem to work
[20:16:15] <defaultro> tinkerbin is even much worse
[20:17:08] <rodd> that selector has effect on newElements, however it has no effect once newElements is added to the document
[20:30:51] <defaultro> i give up, even modifying the values of ui-corner-all and other properties in jquery-ui.css file doesn't modify the corners :(
[20:31:23] <tw2113> why do i get the feeling this is just a specificity issue defaultro
[20:31:36] <tw2113> have you tried adding !important yet?
[20:32:16] <NCS_One> any recent plugins like scrollTo? http://flesler.blogspot.pt/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[20:32:27] <tw2113> why not just use scrollto?
[20:33:13] <defaultro> tw2113, I already modify the css file that jquery uses
[20:33:24] <defaultro> checking what specifty is
[20:34:00] <tw2113> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/
[20:34:07] <defaultro> that's where i am on :)
[20:34:08] <NCS_One> tw2113: it is from 2007 just wondering if the there is a more recent, and maybe with more features
[20:34:36] <defaultro> oh, i read about it yesterday
[20:35:49] <tw2113> features can be overrated
[20:35:57] <tw2113> too many options etc
[20:36:42] <tw2113> do what you need and do it well
[20:37:00] <defaultro> so tw2113, would that mean that there might be another css file that is keeping the properties of ui-corner-*?
[20:37:34] <defaultro> looks like I found the friggin culprit
[20:38:03] <defaultro> there is a body .ui-dialog { border-radius: 10px 10px 10px 10 px; }
[20:38:17] <defaultro> main.css file
[20:38:28] <tw2113> did you ever hit inspect element on the ui-dialog thing
[20:38:34] <tw2113> and see all of the places that have styles applying to it?
[20:38:41] <defaultro> yes, but didn't realize this one
[20:38:54] <defaultro> it was only showing jquery...tom.css
[20:38:58] <defaultro> and my screen.css
[20:39:24] <defaultro> now it showed up because I deleted my entries in screen.css
[20:39:31] <NCS_One> tw2113: right :)
[20:39:48] <defaultro> so now, how do I write it so that mine will be stronger than the one i just posted above?
[20:40:32] <tw2113> body #someid .ui-dialog {} would probably work
[20:40:44] <tw2113> find an ID that this is a child of
[20:40:46] <tw2113> and put that in
[20:40:58] <defaultro> maybe, k
[20:43:00] <defaultro> yes, it's the main.css which has the culprit
[20:46:57] <tw2113> you finally fixed it?
[20:49:06] <defaultro> no
[20:49:13] <defaultro> still havign a hard time figuring it out
[20:49:22] <tw2113> keep learing, keep trying
[20:49:25] <defaultro> i mean, how to overrde it
[20:49:28] <defaultro> :)
[20:49:50] <defaultro> i think once I put a class or id name to the dialogue window, it will fix it
[20:53:14] <defaultro> pastebin.com/KcspmcWR
[20:53:17] <tw2113> are you putting the attempts at the very bottom?
[20:53:21] <defaultro> that's what I have so far and didn't work
[20:53:31] <defaultro> yes
[20:53:42] <tw2113> what's the site url?
[20:54:16] <defaultro> it's on our intranet, local
[20:54:25] <tw2113> well, a couple things i see wrong with that
[20:54:30] <tw2113> you're chaining your classes
[20:54:30] <defaultro> ok
[20:54:44] <defaultro> i tried .welcomebox .ui-dialog, it didn't wokr
[20:54:52] <tw2113> the way you have it now, that'd only select an element that has both welcomebox and ui-dialog
[20:54:57] <tw2113> if you added a space
[20:55:00] <tw2113> that still wouldn't work
[20:55:06] <defaultro> yes, it didn't work
[20:55:10] <tw2113> because there's no element with ui-dialog as a child of welcomebox
[20:55:23] <defaultro> k
[20:55:42] <defaultro> i got confused there
[20:55:45] <tw2113> with what you've pasted so far, i have no idea what has ui-dialog for a class
[20:56:10] <defaultro> i'll update the code, one sec
[20:56:17] <tw2113> if the <p>welcome</p> was <p class="ui-dialog">welcome</p> it'd work
[20:56:30] <tw2113> the version with a space
[20:57:23] <defaultro> oh, I need to manually put it?
[20:57:25] <tw2113> this may end up explaining a lot for why you haven't succeeded yet
[20:57:36] <tw2113> i dunno, i have never used jquery ui before :)
[20:57:48] <tw2113> at least not extensively
[20:57:56] <defaultro> yesterday, my window was based on my own div and it was perfect
[20:58:14] <Cork> defaultro: do you have a live link?
[20:58:14] <defaultro> unfortunately, my officemate told me that I should use jquery ui
[20:58:27] <defaultro> Cork, it's local only, no live link yet
[20:58:51] <Cork> it should be fairly simple to solve if you can look at the dom tree
[20:59:09] <defaultro> pastebin.com/H64TxshE
[20:59:13] <defaultro> i'm willing to learn
[20:59:16] <defaultro> how do I check the dom?
[20:59:20] <sa2304> Hi, everybody :) Can someone enlight me, if JSON.stringify is a Javascript function, JSON must be an object? But console.dir(JSON) shows nothing. What is JSON inside a browser?
[20:59:24] <defaultro> i have firebug installed
[20:59:40] <defaultro> DOM tab is active now
[21:00:17] <tw2113> defaultro is that supposed to create an unordered list inside the welcomebox div?
[21:00:24] <Cork> defaultro: what browser do you use?
[21:00:28] <defaultro> firefox
[21:00:28] <caniuse> defaultro: http://wil.to/_/firefox.gif
[21:00:36] <defaultro> that ordered list is for bullets
[21:00:44] <defaultro> don't worry about that, it's perfect
[21:01:18] <tw2113> you still have no ui-dialog dom element to work with though
[21:01:28] <tw2113> well, ui-dialog class
[21:01:58] <defaultro> not sure how my officemate was able to assign an id of window_0
[21:02:32] <defaultro> the code is also sitting on the same file I updated but I don't see the string window_0 there
[21:03:13] <defaultro> also, when I enable the blue arrow in firefox, the welcomebox sits inside the ui-dialog
[21:03:28] <defaultro> element inspector ;)
[21:03:47] <tw2113> then some bit of js is adding it
[21:03:55] <tw2113> and it's not something that can be seen with view-source
[21:03:56] <defaultro> yes
[21:06:50] <Cork> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/fvAY8/1/
[21:06:59] <Cork> defaultro: is that about what you have?
[21:07:06] <defaultro> checking
[21:07:34] <defaultro> yeah, very close
[21:07:54] <defaultro> wait, the #dialog though
[21:08:37] <defaultro> even when $('#dialog').dialog() is removed, the window is still there
[21:09:05] <defaultro> but yes, the .welcomebox is exactly like that
[21:09:09] <Cork> defaultro: i took your pb and worked from there
[21:09:09] * tw2113 thinks defaultro needs .ui-dialog .welcomebox {}
[21:09:24] <Cork> and you want to remove the rounded corners on the dialog?
[21:09:31] <defaultro> yes
[21:09:35] <Cork> and just this dialog?
[21:09:47] <defaultro> just the dialog and don't want to affect other dialog boxes
[21:09:50] <defaultro> just mine
[21:09:57] <defaultro> i'll try tw2113
[21:10:39] <defaultro> nope, it didn't work
[21:10:55] <defaultro> wait, wrong spelling, LOL
[21:11:06] <tw2113> you really need to get this on a live server if you want effective help :)
[21:11:22] <defaultro> what happened now is that my welcomebox have a border now :D
[21:11:32] <Cork> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/fvAY8/2/
[21:11:36] <defaultro> so rounded outside, then another rectangle inside :D
[21:11:53] <tw2113> then we're getting too specific
[21:11:55] <Cork> defaultro, tw2113: the element you give to dialog becomes an inner part
[21:11:59] <defaultro> WOW
[21:12:02] <Cork> its not the parent to the dialog
[21:12:10] <defaultro> dialogClass is the magic ?
[21:12:14] <Cork> no
[21:12:23] <tw2113> need to find something that the rendered .ui-dialog is a child of
[21:12:26] <Cork> it just adds that to the wrapping ui-dialog element
[21:12:32] <defaultro> trying that now
[21:12:37] <tw2113> #foo .ui-dialog {}
[21:13:32] <Cork> tw2113: .dialog moves the element so that won't work
[21:14:03] <tw2113> no wonder defaultro is going bald
[21:14:07] <Cork> :)
[21:14:19] <Cork> i've fiddled a LOT with ui dialog, so i know it quite well :)
[21:14:31] <tw2113> glad you're here then
[21:14:53] <Cork> built a web-os out of it :D
[21:15:07] <defaultro> my no-rounded-corners got overriden :(
[21:15:25] <Cork> defaultro: your using the default jquery css?
[21:15:30] <Cork> or your own?
[21:15:47] <defaultro> it's being overriden by body .ui-dialog { border-radius: 10px 10px 10px 10px; }
[21:15:55] <defaultro> default
[21:16:00] <defaultro> default jquery
[21:16:02] <Cork> uh.. ui-dialog shouldn't have radius
[21:16:15] <defaultro> don't know why my friggin officemate did that
[21:16:16] <Cork> thats not default
[21:16:20] <defaultro> i don't want to touch it
[21:16:31] * tw2113 pokes it with a spork
[21:16:45] <defaultro> yes because he hardcoded it. Can we make ours win?
[21:16:49] <defaultro> specififcity
[21:16:53] <Cork> ok, then add .ui-dialog.no-rounded-corners
[21:17:01] <defaultro> k
[21:17:03] <Cork> if you make a more specific selector it should work
[21:17:09] <Cork> to your css that is
[21:17:37] <defaultro> BADABING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[21:17:40] <tw2113> body .ui-dialog { border-radius: 0 !important; /*fuck off radii*/ }
[21:17:49] <defaultro> it's good now
[21:18:04] <defaultro> prepending .ui-dialog to no rounded corners made it
[21:18:06] <tw2113> the 3 day battle is over
[21:18:06] <defaultro> woohooo
[21:18:07] <Cork> its farly none hacky too :)
[21:18:13] <defaultro> hahaha
[21:18:20] <defaultro> dialogClass is the magic
[21:18:25] <defaultro> that's what I asked this morning
[21:18:43] <defaultro> how to specify an id or class to a dialog created by jquery :D
[21:19:04] <tw2113> you type it
[21:19:06] <Cork> defaultro: elm.dialog() takes <elm> adds ui-dialog-content and wrapps it in <div class="ui-dialog">
[21:19:08] <defaultro> thank you so much!!!
[21:19:16] <defaultro> elm?
[21:19:22] <Cork> any element
[21:19:23] <tw2113> street
[21:19:30] <defaultro> k
[21:19:32] <tw2113> 1 2 IE's coming for you
[21:20:16] <defaultro> in IE, it's rounded
[21:20:19] <defaultro> hahaha :)
[21:20:34] <defaultro> don't know if it can be fixed in IE
[21:20:36] <tw2113> witchcraft
[21:20:42] <Cork> hmm, your team adds something again :)
[21:20:43] <tw2113> IE9?
[21:20:50] <defaultro> yeah
[21:20:51] <tw2113> csspie?
[21:20:59] <Cork> jquery-ui dialog is never rounded in ie by default
[21:21:01] <tw2113> i think IE9 may support border radius
[21:21:15] <Cork> quite sure its not
[21:21:16] <tw2113> ?caniuse border-radius
[21:21:16] <caniuse> tw2113: You can use CSS3 Border-radius (rounded corners) with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3, Chrome 4, Safari 3.1, Opera 10.5, iOS Safari 3.2, and Opera Mobile 11. http://caniuse.com/#search=border-radius
[21:21:19] * Cork checks

[21:21:24] <defaultro> i'm having a hard time since i'm new to this. It's pretty hard because I am studying jquery, javascript, css, kohana
[21:22:03] <tw2113> defaultro once you stop learning every day, i'll start worrying
[21:22:05] <defaultro> i think mostly now are going back to square corners
[21:22:26] <defaultro> no, I'll continue studying, I love this stuff
[21:22:48] <tw2113> then what's the worry?
[21:22:50] <defaultro> bad thing though, I'm like my old college days, I stay late until 3 or4am
[21:23:01] <defaultro> worry about people rushing me
[21:23:13] <tw2113> meh, i stay up that late anyway
[21:23:34] <defaultro> i don't want to do it again, my eyes almost gave up[
[21:23:42] <defaultro> glad im back to 20/20 vision
[21:23:58] <Cork> defaultro: sorry no its gradient not radius
[21:24:01] <defaultro> a vein erupted inside and it blocked my vision
[21:24:03] <Cork> tw2113: ^
[21:24:29] <tw2113> caniuse.com showed me that IE9 does radii anyway Cork
[21:24:38] <Cork> sure it does
[21:24:44] <Cork> i just mixed them up :)
[21:24:46] * tw2113 wonders how complete the I <3 Jquery iPhone app is
[21:24:54] <defaultro> what's the recommended way to study jquery api?
[21:24:57] <Cork> i just remebered it was something there that didn't work :)
[21:25:01] <dr0id> IE9 doesn't support css3 gradients
[21:25:09] <defaultro> kill IE :D
[21:25:22] <Cork> defaultro: read the api.jquery.com
[21:25:27] <defaultro> k
[21:25:27] <Cork> its very well documented
[21:25:44] <tw2113> see a function look it up
[21:25:58] <Cork> defaultro: as long as you are fairly confy with js, it should be a brease
[21:26:05] <defaultro> i learned a lot on Pascal, I learned a lot from their yellow book. They explain the function and an example below, very similar to php.net docs
[21:26:19] <defaultro> i'm also studying javascript
[21:26:40] <Cork> defaultro: api.jquery.com is farly close to php.net
[21:26:44] <defaultro> my officemate gave me a pdf, Javascript, the good way something
[21:26:50] <defaultro> oh cool
[21:26:54] <Cork> sometimes better. sometimes worse
[21:26:59] <defaultro> :)
[21:27:31] <Cork> after a while you do want to dive into the jquery.js uncompressed file
[21:27:36] <defaultro> i noticed earlier, you added two files to the code, ui them
[21:27:47] <Cork> you can dig up loads of nifty things that the doc doesn't mention
[21:27:52] <defaultro> oh
[21:28:10] <defaultro> but looks like that requires good javascript experience
[21:28:15] <defaultro> i'll get to that point :)
[21:29:10] <Cork> defaultro: yes, it requires a fairly good knowledge of js, thats why i said, later :)
[21:29:19] <defaultro> i noticed, our code should always be inside $(document).ready() ....
[21:29:28] <tw2113> hmm, interesting
[21:29:43] <tw2113> the "I <3 jQuery" app doesn't have .on()
[21:29:52] <Cork> defaultro: depends, in jsfiddle its in onload, and then you don't need ready
[21:30:07] <Cork> defaultro: some put it at the end of the body, you don't need it then either
[21:30:11] <defaultro> k
[21:30:19] <Cork> defaultro: but if you put it in head, yes you must
[21:30:22] <defaultro> yes, my officemate placed it at the end
[21:30:35] <tw2113> js at the bottom
[21:30:37] <Cork> defaultro: but thats nothing new, js needs to do similar things too
[21:30:46] <defaultro> that's where i put my $(.welcomebox)........
[21:30:47] <tw2113> is what the "pros" say
[21:31:06] <Cork> tw2113: kinda depends, on what your site needs
[21:31:26] <defaultro> ok, I'll celebrate for now. Heading down to my basement to do some workout :D
[21:31:37] <Cork> on a closed login enviroment, theres pros to put in in head, and no real cost of puting it there
[21:31:48] <defaultro> thanks folks, but will be online :D
[21:31:56] <tw2113> defaultro
[21:31:59] <tw2113> my best suggestion
[21:32:06] <tw2113> hang out in here even when you don't have issues to ask about
[21:32:29] <Cork> help other, ya thats a good suggestion
[21:32:42] <Cork> its a grate way to learn
[21:33:22] <tw2113> i figure at worst, you'll go googling for possible solutions for them, and see new stuff that you search for yourself later
[21:33:59] <Cork> its a good way to keep you from forgeting solutions too
[21:34:04] <coldhead> great*
[21:34:18] <coldhead> Cork <3
[21:34:24] <Cork> :)
[21:34:31] <Cork> ello coldhead
[21:34:59] <tw2113> get a room
[21:35:06] <Cork> lol
[21:35:16] <defaultro> tw2113, will do :)
[21:35:41] <defaultro> I've been using irc since 1995 :) this is where I learned tons of things
[21:35:52] <Cork> defaultro: same here :)
[21:35:56] <defaultro> hehehe
[21:35:56] <coldhead> its where you learned a lot of irc commands, i expect
[21:36:00] <defaultro> cool
[21:36:06] <Cork> defaultro: started a little earlier though
[21:36:11] <defaultro> cool
[21:36:24] <defaultro> i started on efnet
[21:36:39] <defaultro> i'm actually online there too
[21:36:43] <Cork> ya, it was the place back then
[21:36:51] <defaultro> but few people there responding
[21:37:02] <Cork> exactly >_>
[21:37:11] <defaultro> isn't the api advance for me?
[21:37:27] <Cork> api.jquery.com?
[21:37:37] <defaultro> I think it's ok since I have experience now how to load jquery
[21:37:39] <defaultro> yeah
[21:37:42] <tw2113> *downloads jQm for iphone*
[21:37:49] <tw2113> i can sit down and read about jquery mobile now
[21:37:56] <Cork> nope, it takes everything from basics to deeper things
[21:38:01] <defaultro> ok
[21:38:13] <Cork> defaultro: or are you looking for docs about jquery-ui?
[21:38:25] <Cork> its not the same framework
[21:38:32] <defaultro> oh
[21:38:52] <defaultro> it's because looking at api.jquery.com, the first thing I saw was add
[21:38:52] <Cork> for ui http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[21:38:57] <defaultro> add()
[21:39:04] <defaultro> k
[21:39:13] <Cork> defaultro: api is for what runs below jquery-ui
[21:39:16] <defaultro> k
[21:39:24] <Cork> its a dom modification abstraction layer
[21:39:46] <defaultro> k
[21:40:09] <Cork> ui isn't by far as well documented though
[21:40:27] <Cork> i almost always have to dig in the source to get it to do what i want
[21:40:51] <Cork> and in places its plain wrong
[21:41:05] <defaultro> should I start first with the Getting Started found in jquery.com?
[21:41:29] <Cork> defaultro: its a good place to start
[21:41:32] <defaultro> k
[21:42:44] <Cork> and example of where the ui docs is really confusing is dialog resize events
[21:43:04] <defaultro> ok
[21:43:15] <defaultro> i have another question
[21:43:19] <tw2113> no way
[21:43:29] <tw2113> another one?
[21:43:33] <tga> hello
[21:43:37] <defaultro> simple
[21:43:37] <Cork> from the docs:
[21:43:43] <Cork> $( ".selector" ).dialog({ resize: function(event, ui) { ... } });
[21:43:46] <Cork> $( ".selector" ).bind( "dialogresize", function(event, ui) {});
[21:43:57] <Cork> ".selector" here isn't the same for those two >_<
[21:44:13] <tga> when making ajax() calls inside a loop, how can I access the loop index inside the .done() function?
[21:44:15] * Cork banged his head on that one for hours
[21:44:18] <defaultro> the other guy from other team sent me Javascript The GOod Parts in pdf. Should I study this first before jquery?
[21:44:30] <Cork> tga: you don't
[21:44:34] <defaultro> that's complicated for me righ tnow :D
[21:44:38] <tga> right, so what's the proper way of doing it?
[21:44:50] <tga> Cork, I want to have the done() callback work with my current element, not with the last one in the array
[21:44:53] <Cork> tga: first, do you want to make them all happen at the same time?
[21:44:57] <Cork> or chain them?
[21:45:06] <tga> parallel is fine
[21:45:22] <Cork> ok, then store the index in a variable local to the for loop
[21:45:30] <tga> I just want to call the same function multiple times, so I'm looping through an array with parameters
[21:45:46] <Cork> for(var i=0;i< 10;i++ { var currIndex = i; $.ajax }
[21:46:25] <Cork> tga: the reason you can't use i, is that theres only ever one copy of it
[21:46:28] <tga> I can do even better then, also apply the i to my array and work with the object
[21:46:35] <Cork> so when your .done triggers it will have the value of the last loop
[21:47:03] <tga> right, that I noticed
[21:47:34] <Cork> for(var i=0;i<10;i++) is the same as var i=0; for(;i<10;i++)
[21:47:51] <defaultro> Cork, why does the fadeOut() of the dialog box different when I fadeOut a div? I love the fadingout of the div, it's like opacity. The dialog window shrinks only toward upper left then vanishes
[21:48:32] <Cork> defaultro: try $(selector).dialog('widget').fadeOut()
[21:48:38] <defaultro> k
[21:51:55] <aphid> does fadeOut use css3 transitions if they're supported?
[21:51:59] <defaultro> it worked but it changed the background color of the window that my officemate wrote
[21:52:05] <Cork> aphid: not by default
[21:52:18] <defaultro> when I fadeout mine, I call his $(#window_0).show()
[21:52:24] <tga> Cork, even if I keep the loop counter inside the loop, the done() function only sees the last one
[21:52:34] <aphid> transitions are pretty wild, just started playing around with them
[21:52:44] <aphid> ...must not overdo fading and moving all of the things
[21:52:45] <defaultro> his window's background changed from white background to gray background
[21:53:44] <defaultro> i restored it back to $('.welcomebox).dialog("close");
[21:53:56] <Cork> tga: bah, sorry, for doesn't create a scope
[21:54:30] <defaultro> Cork, do you have any ideas why the other window darkened?
[21:54:49] <tga> Cork, mmkay, so what's a way around that?
[21:54:54] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ndFsg/
[21:54:54] <defaultro> F12 in firefox doesn't even work too
[21:54:59] <Cork> tga: or use $.each
[21:55:15] * tw2113 is on Fx14
[21:55:19] <tga> each works on random arrays too, right?
[21:55:21] <tga> not only on elements
[21:55:29] <Cork> depends on how you call it
[21:55:33] <Cork> $().each doesn't
[21:55:42] <Cork> $.each(arr, function() {}) does
[21:56:00] * tga sighs
[21:56:19] <tga> I see there is a jQuery.each and a each
[21:56:24] <Cork> tga: or to be precise you can't wrapp your array with jquery
[21:56:30] <Cork> $(arr)
[21:56:34] <Cork> thats where it fails
[21:56:41] <tga> right, that makes sense
[21:57:02] <tga> alright, I'll switch to each then
[21:57:23] <tga> inside the callback I'll have 'this' set to the current array element, right?
[21:57:34] <Cork> no its the first param
[21:57:54] <tga> oh, oops
[21:58:14] <Cork> the second is the value from that index
[21:59:18] <tga> the first value is the index, the second is the value
[21:59:39] <tga> callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement)
[21:59:44] <Cork> yup
[22:00:00] <tga> looking good Cork, thanks
[22:00:05] <Cork> np
[22:00:11] <tga> this stuff can be such a pain sometimes
[22:00:19] <tga> async and scopes
[22:00:32] <Cork> its a pain until you get into the flow
[22:00:49] <Cork> until you get async threads that needs to sync
[22:00:53] <Cork> thats ALWAYS a pain
[22:00:57] <aphid> yup
[22:01:23] <aphid> and when you think something is an int and it's a string and you're concatenting #s instead of adding them
[22:01:38] <Cork> heh
[22:01:47] <aphid> "10" + 13 = 1013
[22:01:52] <Cork> no
[22:01:57] <Cork> "10" + 13 = "1013"
[22:02:18] <aphid> yes
[22:02:31] <tga> that is quite sensible actually, it saves you from calling toString() on everything
[22:02:49] <aphid> yeah, loose types are great until they bite you in the ass
[22:02:59] <aphid> and then it's your own damn fault
[22:03:01] <Cork> tga: well it becoms nasty when one of the vars is an object
[22:03:22] <Cork> ?eval var a1 = 10, a2 = { key:100 }; a1+a2
[22:03:25] <bot-t> Cork: "10[object Object]"
[22:03:25] <tga> can't you override toString?
[22:03:37] <tga> I do that a lot in python, works quite nicely
[22:03:55] <Cork> you can but that will mess with some of how js works
[22:04:34] <systemfault> It's fine as long as you don't mess with the prototype I guess..
[22:04:42] <Cork> ya
[22:04:55] <aphid> i think the . concatenator in php is the only thing I still like about that language
[22:04:56] <Cork> like Object.prototype.toString
[22:05:19] <Cork> aphid: i actually like php quite well
[22:05:33] <Cork> aphid: if you write modern php and to it strictly its a nice language
[22:05:41] <Cork> *and do it
[22:05:46] <aphid> i still use it a lot, slowly transitioning to node
[22:05:52] <Cork> if you write php4 code, it sucks
[22:06:11] <Cork> mostly rails and go here
[22:06:27] <aphid> one language to bind(them).all()
[22:06:34] <Cork> rails if its something that doens't need to be fast by versatile, and go for speed
[22:06:43] <Cork> *fast but
[22:06:44] <aphid> or something in the darkness
[22:07:01] <Cork> i don't like the idea of running js on the server
[22:07:30] <tw2113> so don't :)
[22:07:31] <aphid> i've had mixed results, and none of them had to scale much
[22:07:37] <systemfault> Nothing's fundamentally wrong with it‚Ä¶ But I personally don't like playing with async
[22:07:48] <dr0id> async is great
[22:07:51] <systemfault> (Running JS on the server)
[22:07:55] <aphid> it's still a bit early for LAMP necrologues
[22:18:04] <moldy84> i have some ajax calls made on document ready that don't run on first page load, i either have to  reload the page or open the link in a new window to cause the ajax calls to execute. anyonw know what could cause this?
[22:22:57] <NCS_One> how can I perform a sliding hide and a sliding show at the same time?
[22:23:17] <Cork> uh on two different elements?
[22:23:22] <NCS_One> yes
[22:23:48] <NCS_One> the second one breaks the first one
[22:23:50] <Cork> $(elm1).slideDown('slow'); $(elm2).slideDown('slow');
[22:23:56] <Cork> * $(elm1).slideDown('slow'); $(elm2).slideUp('slow');
[22:24:07] <NCS_One> I have
[22:24:10] <Cork> NCS_One: breaks as in?
[22:24:29] <NCS_One> the one that should hide simply disapears
[22:24:43] <Cork> ?demo @ NCS_One
[22:24:44] <bot-t> NCS_One, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:24:57] <NCS_One> ok
[22:32:41] <CulpepersFinest> Fairly new at jquery, but I have a serialized string from my form submission passing it to my php page so I can enter it into mysql db.   I'm having a hard time parsing the jquery .post string.  Any thoughts on how to parse the long .post serialized string?
[22:35:30] <CulpepersFinest> anybody here
[22:36:22] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: how are you serializing the string?
[22:36:26] <systemfault> They're all gone playing Diablo 3
[22:37:14] <CulpepersFinest> var formvalues =  $("form").serialize();
[22:37:44] <systemfault> CulpepersFinest: Then all the params should be in your $_POST array, no?
[22:37:44] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: then its just part of the $_POST array
[22:37:55] <Cork> no parsing needed
[22:39:00] <CulpepersFinest> the first post array is the date=jljlkj&something& something & something@comments=text;  I need the date and the comments pulled out of that string, so I can loop through the post array
[22:39:30] <CulpepersFinest> when I try to do a explode('&',$_POST); it just returns the name array not the values
[22:39:34] <CulpepersFinest> sorry this is php now
[22:39:51] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: $_POST['date']
[22:39:57] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: $_POST['comments']
[22:40:13] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: sorry $_POST['something@comments']
[22:40:38] <CulpepersFinest> I can do that, but then how do I get the rest of the data, because I have jquery that copies the last table row, so I could have several fname, lname, etc.. fields
[22:40:40] <systemfault> Seems like he never did any PHP :/
[22:40:58] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: its key=value sets
[22:41:08] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: just grab the key you want
[22:41:08] <CulpepersFinest> A little php.... I do ksh at work, not much web programming anymore
[22:41:18] <CulpepersFinest> but thanks for helping systemfault
[22:41:24] <systemfault> I tried.
[22:41:33] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: this is basic url params handling
[22:41:44] <Cork> ?g site:php.net $_POST
[22:42:09] <CulpepersFinest> let me get the seralized string, so you can see why its not that simple
[22:42:33] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: its is more a php question then jquery

[22:46:55] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: just grab them by there key name
[22:47:00] <sts231> yes or no
[22:47:11] <dr0id> yes
[22:47:12] <ndss56> sts23: can monkeys fly?
[22:47:13] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: btw som of those won't work
[22:47:16] <dr0id> just saw a flying monkey pass by
[22:47:20] <sts231> jesus man
[22:47:22] <CulpepersFinest> even if there are multiple params named players, card, etc...
[22:47:27] <sts231> why is everyone on irc such a snob
[22:47:29] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: you have keys accuring multible times
[22:47:32] <sts231> can someone actually properly help me out
[22:47:40] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: no they will be overwritten
[22:47:41] <CulpepersFinest> just loop through the $_POST and call them by there param name.  nothing more, nothing less
[22:47:56] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: you need to change so you generate arrays from your from
[22:48:10] <Cork> players[]= instead of palyers=
[22:48:12] <Cork> and so on
[22:48:23] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: or structure it another way
[22:48:25] <ndss56> sts231: we already gave you the answer.
[22:48:32] <sts231> thats not an answer
[22:48:47] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: if a key exist multible times only the last occurance will survive
[22:49:13] <CulpepersFinest> Correct, that is the dilema I am trying to figure out.
[22:49:34] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: change the names in the form
[22:49:52] <Cork> NCS_One: did you catch that response?
[22:50:05] <CulpepersFinest> I can't... jquery is taking the last row as a copy so the end user and enter as much data as they need.
[22:50:17] <TylerWhitney> I know .serialize() ignores unchecked radios and checkboxes, but will it serialize blank text inputs? http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ doesnt seem to tell me
[22:50:27] <Cork> CulpepersFinest: then you can't send it as a post
[22:50:30] <ndss56> sts231: If you missed the memo the answer to your question is the same as this, "can monkeys fly?"
[22:51:00] <NCS_One> Cork: any plugin I can do this? I want to load some content with ajax, append/prepend to site content, hide the old content and show the new content, this with sliding from left to right
[22:51:25] <Cork> NCS_One: did you see the fixed jsfiddle i posted?
[22:51:32] <sts231> okay thanks for your help. i hope you guys can pat yourselves in the back tonight
[22:51:46] <CulpepersFinest> any other thoughs on how to pass the serialized data to the php page.  I'm using the ajax method, datatype: JSON, type:POST,
[22:51:49] <dualcore> NCS_One: you don't need a plugin to do that.  simple jquery :]
[22:52:23] <CulpepersFinest> Thanks Cork for the time
[22:52:28] <NCS_One> Cork: if you watch it close the slideDown is not performed
[22:52:33] <LongDick> culpepersfinest you faggot!    Thanks to your cheating I now have fucking warts on my dick!  I told you!

[22:55:01] <wkmanire> Somewhere a 16 year old proudly laughs alone in his bedroom (but not loud enough to wake up mother).
[22:55:06] <TylerWhitney> lol
[22:55:28] <TylerWhitney> how is it possibly feasible that such a coincidence that we are all homosexual cheaters
[22:55:36] <CulpepersFinest> hey off topic question... to respond directly to someone in these forums I see people prefacing their comments with <username>:  <comment>  are you guys just typing that in or is their some tip for responding directly to somebody
[22:55:50] <ndss56> what is "cialis"? :D
[22:56:05] <systemfault> ndss56: Wikipedia?
[22:56:36] <ndss56> systemfault: thats ok if you don't know.
[22:56:39] <roodypoopoo> ndss56 you faggot!    Thanks to your cheating I now have fucking warts on my dick!  I told you!

[22:56:39] <wkmanire> CulpepersFinest: This is an IRC channel. Most IRC clients let you tab complete other user nicks.
[22:57:16] <CulpepersFinest> wkmanire: nice... thats what I was looking for thanks
[22:57:19] <TylerWhitney> CulpepersFinest: e.g I just typed "Cu" and hit tab and your name comes up, I occasionally type it out though in clients that dont do it
[22:57:40] <roodypoopoo> culpepersfinest you faggot!    Thanks to your cheating I now have fucking warts on my dick!  I told you!

[22:57:51] <CulpepersFinest> TylerWhitney: Thanks... trying to make more use of these forums, instead of the ol google search
[22:58:10] <wkmanire> :/ This bot is getting pretty annoying.
[22:58:24] <CulpepersFinest> sweet... Well I have to go and wake up my wife now and tell her that aparently I'm a faggot
[22:58:39] <TylerWhitney> coincidence that the bot came up right after that unhappy citizen left complaing nobody could help him?
[22:58:41] <wkmanire> CulpepersFinest: This isn't a forum.... it's an IRC channel.
[22:58:49] <Circlefusion> what the hell
[22:58:58] <roodypoopoo> circlefusion you faggot!    Thanks to your cheating I now have fucking warts on my dick!  I told you!

That will teach you to cheat on me and get me infected!
[22:59:00] <CulpepersFinest> wkmanire: gotcha.... sorry...
[22:59:01] <Circlefusion> aww
[22:59:52] <wkmanire> CulpepersFinest: I'm not trying to be OCD. he he he, if you say the word forum you're going to confuse the hell out of most IRC users.
[23:00:09] <wkmanire> "So I was in the jQuery forum the other day and some guy named coldhead really helped me a lot."
[23:00:17] <TylerWhitney> I guess Ill just have to test my serialize question
[23:00:21] <systemfault> ajpiano: Good
[23:00:25] <ajpiano> wkmanire: ping me if you ever see that type of stufff...
[23:00:55] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Sure thing
[23:08:37] <NCS_One> Cork: sorry I didn't know I could use jquery ui http://jsfiddle.net/kmMRw/2/
[23:08:50] <NCS_One> this is what I am trying
[23:09:03] <dualcore> jquery ui is gay
[23:09:36] <soee> hmm, what event/function shoul i use if i want to validate text vieled every time its value change (user type some chars or copy paste whole stroing)
[23:10:10] <wkmanire> soee: vieled?
[23:10:16] <wkmanire> field?
[23:10:17] <soee> *field
[23:11:15] <wkmanire> soee: Trap the events change, keyup and blur.
[23:12:01] <wkmanire> that's probably overkill but you won't miss any changes.
[23:12:55] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Lots of cranky people /join'ing tonight.
[23:13:16] <systemfault> Probably the same fucker..
[23:13:43] <systemfault> It's sad...
[23:14:03] <systemfault> I think the channel is overall a wonderful community
[23:15:10] <wkmanire> same. I keep coming back to #jquery, even after months of doing non-javascript related work.
[23:15:16] <ajpiano> guys going off on me in pm
[23:15:16] <ajpiano> lol
[23:15:51] <ndss56> dualcore is a regular.
[23:15:57] <ndss56> ...i think
[23:16:16] <systemfault> If that's the case.. his joke had a bad timing.
[23:16:19] <ajpiano> well
[23:16:23] <ajpiano> not for long http://fixee.org/paste/issej10/
[23:18:00] <systemfault> Anyway‚Ä¶. Diablo 3 guys‚Ä¶ Diablo 3.
[23:18:41] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Wow. Called you a retard. I haven't heard that one in a long time.
[23:19:10] <wkmanire> I hope something of that conversation lands on bash.org
[23:19:31] <systemfault> Meh.. not worth it.
[23:19:50] <ndss56> To be fair "that word", i dare not say it aloud now, does have more than one meaning :D
[23:19:52] <ajpiano> i like the idea that if you don't think it's acceptable to use "gay" as a slur, you obviously are gay
[23:19:57] <ajpiano> it takes me back to like, middle school
[23:20:29] <wkmanire> It doesn't really matter what word you use.
[23:20:30] <systemfault> ndss56: Nobody really use the word gay for its real meaning anymore..
[23:20:41] <systemfault> Sad.
[23:20:57] <TylerWhitney> systemfault: happy?
[23:21:01] <wkmanire> There is no purpose in summing up all of jQuery-UI in a single adjective.
[23:21:05] <systemfault> TylerWhitney: Right.
[23:21:25] <TylerWhitney> well even homosexuals adopted the word, but I still dont get the use in context people use it
[23:21:25] <wkmanire> He would have been better off going to the right channel and posting his actual complaints.
[23:21:40] <NCS_One> I'm getting some content using ajax and on ajax success I want to slide out the old content and almost at the same time slide in the new content. Any plugin recommendations? I currently looking at scrollTo but doesn't work soo well sliding left to right
[23:21:43] <ndss56> That said, it is clear that he used "that word" is a degrogatory manner.
[23:21:45] <TylerWhitney> how can a topic or item be homosexual? lol
[23:21:49] <mierdaman> ncs_one 23:17] -syn- Your reported IP [200.79.133.171] is banned: Spam, harassment, and antisocial behavior are off-topic on freenode. Contact klines@freenode.net with questions.

[23:22:16] <TylerWhitney> lol
[23:22:31] <wkmanire> nom nom nom
[23:22:35] <wkmanire> eated by the admin.
[23:22:39] <TylerWhitney> how do you guys fight the spammers, ban IPs as they come?
[23:22:49] <systemfault> Web gateways always end up being abused.. :/
[23:22:50] <TylerWhitney> and then they tire themselves out
[23:22:55] <ndss56> How are people like that able to get back in after being banned?
[23:22:55] <beancurd> ban russian ips
[23:22:57] <ajpiano> TylerWhitney: it's rare for crap lilke this to come along and it not be somethin they should be catching at the network level
[23:23:04] <coldhead> if i had ops i'd kick aj for not having a wittier kick message
[23:23:06] <ajpiano> ndss56: i hadn't banned any of that spammer yet
[23:23:23] <systemfault> ndss56: Connection with dynamic IPs‚Ä¶ or proxies...
[23:23:33] <beancurd> what the merits of just panning swathes of ips that aren't relevant?
[23:23:39] <ajpiano> coldhead: unfortunately alacrity and aesthetic quality are mutually exclusive qualities of an IRC kick
[23:23:43] <TylerWhitney> yeah I assumed they were proxies, don't want to ban EVERYBODY who uses the proxies
[23:23:48] <wkmanire> NCS_One: Can you post a link? I'm not sure exactly what you mean but it doesn't sound like you need a plugin.
[23:23:51] <coldhead> pish, aj, you're quite capable
[23:23:51] <systemfault> coldhead: Pff.. you don't deserve it since it's your first day here.
[23:23:54] <ndss56> systemfault: the wonders of dynamic IPs
[23:23:58] <TylerWhitney> hopefully they tire themselves out
[23:23:59] <coldhead> incidentally, ur a gay
[23:24:07] <wkmanire> head
[23:24:16] <coldhead> more like gayQuery UI amirite
[23:24:23] <coldhead> and so on
[23:24:28] <systemfault> coldhead: gayQueery is even gayer.
[23:24:37] <systemfault> :/
[23:24:40] <systemfault> o_O
[23:24:43] <wkmanire> ha ha ha
[23:24:48] <wkmanire> coldhead can't help himself.
[23:24:55] <ndss56> lol
[23:24:56] <wkmanire> He'll be back.
[23:25:51] <dman777> i was on http://www.jqueryplugins.com/ and i got a virus from one of the plug ins :(

[23:26:06] <ajpiano> ok now i have to do something
[23:26:07] <ajpiano> arg
[23:26:10] <TylerWhitney> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw7IMYl5oU8
[23:26:22] <wkmanire> ajpiano: He's proxying like crazy.
[23:26:23] <ndss56> ajpiano: goodluck
[23:26:27] <systemfault> ajpiano: How many people on the chan use the web gateway?
[23:26:36] <ajpiano> i'm prob just gonna ban web gateway for a few hours
[23:26:38] <systemfault> ajpiano: Perhaps you could disable it for a moment..
[23:26:40] <ajpiano> yep
[23:26:41] <systemfault> Yeah.
[23:26:55] <TylerWhitney> not sure why they think they are talented because they can do that
[23:27:08] <TylerWhitney> causing a minor inconvenience to an IRC channel is NOT hacking
[23:27:16] <dman777> lol true
[23:27:24] <systemfault> TylerWhitney: Le HAXOR!
[23:27:28] <TylerWhitney> lol
[23:28:01] <iman> does jquery unable to transfer unicode character from server to client through ajax ?
[23:28:44] <NCS_One> wkmanire: I have a content div with some content, when user clicks some ling I get new content from the server. Then I want to slide out the old content and at same time slide in the new content, this from left to right
[23:28:49] <ndss56> We shall see if he can come back in...
[23:28:50] <wkmanire> iman: No. Are you using python on the server per chance?
[23:29:01] <iman> Java Servlet
[23:29:11] <NCS_One> wkmanire: get the new content using ajax
[23:29:35] <wkmanire> NCS_One: There are a couple of ways you can time this
[23:29:50] <ajpiano> systemfault: i banned web gateway for 6 horus
[23:29:53] <ajpiano> that should help it out
[23:29:57] <TylerWhitney> before I finish coding someone can anybody let me know if .serialize() when called on a form will also build blank text input queries? I know it ignores checkboxes and radios if unchecked
[23:30:01] <wkmanire> NCS_One: all of the ajax calls and animations (like slideOut and fadeIn) take callbacks that are called after they complete.
[23:30:02] <ajpiano> i'll keep an eye out but ping me if anything happens
[23:30:05] <snover> poor web gateway
[23:30:09] <systemfault> ajpiano: ok :)
[23:30:14] <iman> wkmanire: i want to render some pronunciation words but them appear like question mark and i'm using java servlet
[23:30:18] <wkmanire> NCS_One: So you can orchestrate it that way, or you can use $.Deferreds which is a lot awesomer.
[23:31:01] <wkmanire> iman: You can indicate which encoding you want in the HTTP Headers of your response.
[23:31:11] <wkmanire> iman: I think there is also a metatag for that as well.
[23:31:21] <ndss56> coldhead: welcome back.
[23:31:22] <coldhead> GUYS I AM HAVING TROUBLE CONNECTING VIA THE WEB CLIENT>!>!!!!
[23:31:34] <wkmanire> coldhead: Did you take the opportunity to get another beer?
[23:31:35] <systemfault> iman: if you're using tomcat‚Ä¶ it doesn't use utf-8 by default which is totally weird.
[23:31:35] <coldhead> I THINK IT'S BEEN HACKED
[23:31:43] <systemfault> coldhead: OH NOES!
[23:32:11] <NCS_One> wkmanire: the getting the content and handling it I have it ok, the problem is the animation, I try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/kmMRw/2/
[23:32:19] <coldhead> no wkmanire, i took some time to think about what i'd done wrong and looked at some photos to make me appreciate that man love is just as valid as any other kind
[23:32:26] <iman> systemfault: wkmanire i want to indicate such as these characters …í  å …ô ...
[23:32:34] <coldhead> the tenderness...
[23:32:54] <NCS_One> wkmanire: also this one http://flesler.blogspot.pt/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[23:32:56] <systemfault> iman: If the page encoding is utf-8 and the browser font supports it, it should work
[23:33:00] <iman> i don't know what encoding they are consist
[23:33:15] <NCS_One> wkmanire: but works very bad with slides left to right
[23:33:25] <wkmanire> NCS_One: Ahhh, I see what you mean now.
[23:33:52] <systemfault> iman: In your web browser.. can you see which encoding you're using?
[23:33:56] <wkmanire> hmm, it might be easier to put all of your content into one div and then crop it.
[23:34:06] <wkmanire> NCS_One: At least it would appear more consistent.
[23:34:19] <iman> systemfault: http://dpaste.com/748373/
[23:34:35] <ndss56> coldhead: i hope those photos didn't give you a lift.
[23:34:37] <wkmanire> Anyone else ideas on this problem for NCS_One? I don't use the animations all that much.
[23:35:01] <systemfault> iman: Looks fine :/
[23:35:20] <TylerWhitney> ok I tested my own question text inputs are kept
[23:35:23] <iman> systemfault: what i get is ?
[23:35:26] <iman> '?'
[23:35:41] <systemfault> iman: You're sure that your current browser font has that character?
[23:36:33] <iman> systemfault: yes, i can see such as these character in other sites
[23:36:49] <systemfault> Weird :/
[23:37:03] <wkmanire> NCS_One: You could use CSS clip https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/clip, or perhaps overflow: none with position:relative. Stick both divs in a parent div, then put that parent div in yet one more container, then move it around inside the parent.
[23:37:22] <iman> systemfault: every thing is before ajax transfer
[23:38:01] <wkmanire> I don't think having competeing simulatanous animations are going to appear smooth like you want them to.
[23:38:24] <coldhead> use flash?
[23:38:38] <systemfault> coldhead: You deserve to be kicked.
[23:38:41] <systemfault> :/
[23:38:45] <TylerWhitney> coldhead: who uses flash anymore?
[23:38:54] <systemfault> Keep flash for video players..
[23:38:58] <systemfault> ONLY.
[23:39:33] <TylerWhitney> systemfault: for NOW
[23:39:48] <TylerWhitney> systemfault: hopefully soon HTML5/JS will take over that too
[23:40:07] <systemfault> Yeah‚Ä¶ until they can agree on a single format‚Ä¶ until you can get live streaming with HTML5.. and perhaps even DRM (Or else companies won't use it)
[23:40:31] <TylerWhitney> systemfault: unfortunately yes
[23:40:35] <dman777> what is a good website for jquery plug ins? i went http://www.jqueryplugins.com/ and got a virus from one of the plugins
[23:41:01] <systemfault> dman777: I usually google for them :(
[23:41:11] <systemfault> I don't know any definitive source..
[23:41:16] <NCS_One> wkmanire: I could always try to do it with something like http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[23:41:43] <ajpiano> dman777: http://jquerylist.com http://jquerystyle.com
[23:41:53] <wkmanire> I think carousel used to have a good reputation. Don't know if that is still the case.
[23:41:54] <ajpiano> aw the second one went down
[23:42:02] <snover> mlm
[23:42:02] <caniuse> snover: much like myself
[23:42:08] <snover> thanks caniuse
[23:45:30] <Maniasa> Hello. Anybody here that could help me with a problem regarding jquery function (onLoad)
[23:45:59] <systemfault> Yeah‚Ä¶ what's wrong?
[23:47:55] <Maniasa> Well. We need a function to execute like bodyonload(). The problem with jquery is that the function starts to run after the page has been loaded. We need the function to be ready when the page is loading
[23:49:18] <systemfault> Maniasa: jQuery has a synthetic "ready" event
[23:49:53] <systemfault> Maniasa: $(document).ready(function() { codeHere(); }); or its shorthand   $(function() { codeHere(); });
[23:50:26] <hope> hello good day can someone help me with my problem in jquery sortable?
[23:52:01] <wkmanire> systemfault: What do you mean by synthetic?
[23:52:23] <PA-tle> Hi. Im on the same project as Maniasa. The problem with the .ready function is that if you are beeing sent from another page, the second page will never load completely and .ready will never run... I have read about a pageinit function. Do you know anything about this?
[23:54:01] <wkmanire> PA-tle: Page loads are independant of eachother. If the browser is navigated to another page that also contains a reference to jQuery and binds a ready handler then it will fire.
[23:54:27] <systemfault> wkmanire: Until recently in newer browsers, there was no real "ready"(ondomcontentloaded) event.. you had different "hacks" for different browsers to detect when the DOM tree is in a ready state.
[23:54:44] <wkmanire> systemfault: Ahhh, that's what you meant by synthetic.
[23:54:59] <systemfault> Yeah :)
[23:57:22] <wkmanire> :( dammit, unit test failing and I can't figure it out just by reading the code. Hate it when that happens.
[23:57:28] <PA-tle> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8722606/need-to-refresh-page-in-jquery-mobile <- The first reply in this forum say that it's not loaded completely in JQM. Do you know any alternative functions that does the same job?
[23:58:30] <wkmanire> PA-tle: Mentioning that you're working with jquery mobile would have been a good idea.
[23:58:33] <wkmanire> :P
[23:58:53] <PA-tle> Sorry =P
[23:59:56] <wkmanire> PA-tle: You're probably going to be better off asking this question in #jquerymobile.
