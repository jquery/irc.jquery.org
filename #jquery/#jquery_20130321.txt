[00:33:00] <Hilton> Guess not!"
[01:02:56] <divno> I'm trying to show a div element (that has a hidden text) after I click a submit button.. trying to figure out what went wrong >> http://jsbin.com/alajeq/1/edit thanks
[01:06:15] <ipl79> divno,
[01:06:34] <divno> yeah?
[01:06:35] <grafi> no such function as 'clicked'
[01:06:47] <ipl79> you must prepend with $ on divno ("div#information").show() : ("div#information").show(); ---> $("div#information").show();
[01:07:36] <grafi> plus you check is hasBeenClicked is true before anyone could actually submit the form
[01:08:48] <divno> ipl79: Thanks.. forgot to prepend the $ sign.
[01:09:26] <ipl79> divno, would be better to give an ID to the submit button rather than filter it by its name attribute
[01:09:29] <divno> grafi: Your correct, no such thing as 'clicked'.. changed it to 'click' ..  but right after the document is ready I added hasBeenClicked = false;;
[01:09:42] <grafi> yes
[01:09:49] <grafi> then you bind the click handler
[01:09:57] <divno> grafi: Using the data function?
[01:10:08] <grafi> then you immediately check if hasbeenclicked is true, which it isnt
[01:10:13] <grafi> because you set it to false
[01:10:14] <grafi> ;)
[01:10:33] <divno> ipl79: lol.. I thought I had it set as id hence the hashtag "div#information", thanks
[01:10:51] <ipl79> and always use the "on" event instead of particular events: ("input[name='submitButton']").clicked(function() {  --> $("#yourInputID").on("click", function(){});
[01:10:53] <divno> grafi: I want it to be set to false unless it executes the click function
[01:10:59] <divno> Isn't that the way to do it?
[01:11:22] <grafi> well its not enough to set it to true when i click it
[01:11:39] <grafi> because you will not check if it is true or do something with it
[01:12:31] <ipl79> divno, furthermore, you are trying to show the hidden div by clicking a submit button
[01:13:13] <ipl79> your page will change to your form action before showing the div
[01:16:58] <limpc> why does a span with position:absolute seem to break out of a div with position:relative set?
[01:17:26] <limpc> left: 0 sets the span to 0 of window, instead of 0 of div
[01:17:53] <ravenzz> limpc this is a css question, let's talk about it on #CSS
[01:18:01] <ravenzz> also prepair a testcase
[01:26:38] <divno> grafi: ipl79: Sorry for the late response, it was overwhelming and redid the script section.. binding event handler, using 'on' function, changing type=submit to type=button .. hopefully I'm moving in the right direction : http://jsbin.com/alajeq/2/edit
[01:28:01] <grafi> it seems like you dont really understand how the whole thing works yet divno
[01:28:15] <grafi> if($("input[name='submitButton']").on('click')) < doesnt make any sense
[01:28:23] <limpc> ravenzz: i figured it out. thanks
[01:29:14] <ipl79> divno, change your <input type="button" name="submitButton" value="Submit"> for <input type="button" id="submitButton" value="Submit">; the only purpose for name attribute is to send it to the form action page via http header
[01:30:11] <ipl79> so... $("input[name='submitButton']").click(function() { --> $("#submitButton").on("click", function(){$("#information").show();});
[01:30:54] <divno> grafi: Well the event handler is associated with an event which in this case is click.. and it performs an action once it the event gets triggered... by doing this $(this).on('click', true); (few lines above) I thought by using that as a condition in the if statement it would evaluate to true. Just wrapping my head around it that's all
[01:32:07] <divno> Thinking that IF it was clicked then do this.
[01:42:42] <limpc> hrm how do you make a hover menu not vanish when you mouseout of the object the hover menu was bound to?

[02:17:26] <bgy_> Clex, well, it's what I'm gonna test, but it comes from a third party lib and from my previous test it is, I'll double check

[02:33:26] <granden> Hi, could you folks recommend any nice jquery crop/image rotate plugin?
[02:33:46] <granden> Tried a few, like jCrop but not really satisfied.
[03:02:15] <didiergm> HI - JQM, trying to add a custom right-padding on a form element; but style padding-right:35px is completely ignored any idea
[03:10:12] <Dirkos> Can someone help me explain callback events in combination with 2 contructed objects? I have some code over here with a line where the callback needs to be executed: http://jsbin.com/oviguf/1/edit
[03:12:08] <Cork> Dirkos: not really a jquery question, and there is no callbacks there
[03:12:52] <Dirkos> Cork: yeah but my question is how i should do it
[03:12:54] <Cork> btw why are you using defineProperties when all you do is create a setPosition pointer to an anonymous function?
[03:13:03] <Dirkos> Cork: i wanna execute the Viewport.draw() function for there
[03:13:13] <Cork> User.prototype.setPosition = function() {};
[03:13:45] <Dirkos> Cork: this is for future use since there will be more functions coming :) this is just some basic stuff
[03:13:59] <Cork> Dirkos: only reason to use defineProperty is if you want to use getter or setter
[03:14:09] <Cork> not to define a plain function
[03:14:22] <Dirkos> Cork: and what about enumerable / writable etc?
[03:14:38] <Cork> doens't really change anything
[03:14:49] <Cork> only reason to use defineProperty is if you want to use getter or setter
[03:14:57] <Cork> and then you can use it for those values
[03:15:01] <Dirkos> Ok thnx for that. But can you help me with that callback or?
[03:15:13] <Cork> it will reduce the complexity of the code enormously
[03:15:38] <Cork> not sure what you mean by callback here...
[03:15:44] <Dirkos> Cork: i got a bit stuck so i need some use case example for it
[03:15:48] <Cork> you want to take a third argument to the function and call it?
[03:15:57] <Dirkos> well in the user object, when the position is changed i want the Viewport.draw to be executed
[03:16:18] <Nancy2012> I want to know.. how can i do if  google lat and lng are inserted by google map pointer then input fields(lng n lat) would be disabled
[03:16:20] <Dirkos> so i was thinking about an event listener or something but how do i do this?
[03:16:50] <Cork> Dirkos: no just call this.draw()
[03:17:27] <Dirkos> but "this" is the User object and not the viewport in the user object?
[03:18:20] <Cork> so add a reference to the viewport to the user object when you add it to the viewport
[03:18:30] <Cork> and then user that reference
[03:18:54] <Dirkos> so like: var user = new User(); user.viewport = this; ?
[03:19:06] <Dirkos> isnt that taking alot of resources if i have like 40 users at once?
[03:20:02] <Cork> no like this.users.push(user); user.viewport = this;
[03:20:29] <Cork> is just one pointer per user
[03:20:37] <Dirkos> ah ok thnx :)
[03:20:50] <Dirkos> but can you explain me how an event listener would work or?
[03:21:21] <Dirkos> Cork:  cant find any good use case when its done on 2 objects etc
[03:21:23] <Cork> not really as your don't working with dom
[03:21:54] <Cork> Dirkos: events are expensive, and mainly for getting information from the browser
[03:21:54] <Dirkos> ah ok
[03:22:04] <Dirkos> Cork: thnx for the info
[03:23:55] <Dirkos> Cork: 1 last question. When i set this pointer in my User object. I get like an endless loop when browsing it with firebug right?
[03:24:17] <Cork> well ya?
[03:24:29] <Dirkos> yeah just a question if that was right :)
[03:24:54] <Cork> the user will have a pointer to the viewport and the viewport will have pointers to all users
[03:25:40] <soee> hi, how can i replace current class/classes with new one (so the old are removed)?
[03:26:20] <Cork> soee: javascript doesn't have classes
[03:26:28] <Cork> it has constructors, and prototype
[03:26:52] <Cork> the constructor and prototype is removed when you replace all references to them
[03:27:08] <Cork> replace/remove
[03:27:29] <soee> Cork, sorry i didn't explained it completely , i want to replace element css classess :)
[03:27:40] <Cork> oh
[03:28:03] <soee> so all current are replaced bye one or more new
[03:28:07] <soee> *by
[03:28:14] <Cork> removeClass('class1 class2 class3').addClass('class4 class5 class6');
[03:28:45] <soee> Cork, and is it possible to remove all classes without providing their names ?
[03:28:56] <Cork> soee: normally you should be careful with classes on elements
[03:29:10] <Cork> as other code then the code your writing might add classes in the future
[03:29:18] <Cork> so you should only touch your classes
[03:29:43] <soee> Cork, ok ill use removeClass / addCLass
[03:29:46] <Cork> else your code would have to be modified for other scripts to work
[03:32:16] <vinex08> i have a plugin that conflicts with my jquery.js -- ddpowerzoomer.js when i remove this, the jquery simple tab works, but when i put it again.. the image zoomer works but the simple jquery tab doesnt
[03:32:18] <LG87> I'm programming an app for Android/iPhone by using the Cordova API. But the jQuery is rather slow when you press the buttons (response time). I've been told this is because jQuery uses click events and not touch? Anyone know how to 'relatively easy' change this so the response time is faster?
[03:32:47] <vinex08> how can i know what code is causing the conflict
[03:37:13] <Cork> vinex08: there isn't really a good way to do it, except for plain manual labor
[03:37:32] <lukas___> hi there, i've some problem with basic selectors. i want to select a forms deep child with name *.module_id.* . i tried $(this).parents("form").children("input[name*=module_id]"); but the problem is, that this input is no direct child of "form" ... how to do this?
[03:37:52] <Cork> vinces: but normally if they are written correctly the only thing that could conflict is if they try to do the same thing on a dom element (or if they use the same jquery public name)
[03:38:16] <Cork> ?.find @ lukas___
[03:38:26] <Cork> aaaand the bot is down
[03:38:42] <Cork> lukas___: http://api.jquery.com/find/
[03:38:58] <Cork> also i recommend not using regex name selectors
[03:39:03] <Cork> they are slow
[03:39:23] <Cork> add a class for the group you want on the elements instead
[03:40:10] <lukas___> cork: thx i'll try
[03:42:10] <vinex08> thanks cork
[03:50:16] <style> Hi, how can I reload jquery UI tabs current tabs content (ajax tabs)?
[03:52:34] <Cork> style: i think you can do it though beforeLoad
[03:55:32] <style> Cork: hmh how?
[03:55:48] <Cork> style: you want the tab to reload when its switched to right?
[03:56:07] <style> no, I want to reload tabs content while its selected
[03:56:20] <style> i.e. if something changes in it
[03:56:20] <Cork> an, then you would prob have to do it manually
[03:56:46] <style> hmh ok
[04:39:04] <Souvent22> Hello.
[04:39:13] <Souvent22> How do I use the current location/div that I am in as a selector?
[04:39:41] <Cork> SoulShadow: you are in?
[04:39:45] <Souvent22> like I have something in an html doc, and deep in a div I have a <script> tag, and I want to look for a "parent" from where the code is being called in the script tag.
[04:39:45] <Cork> you mean this?
[04:40:04] <Dr_ST> hi folks
[04:40:04] <Cork> *Souvent22:
[04:40:29] <Cork> Souvent22: scripts don't have a local reference to the dom
[04:40:52] <Cork> Souvent22: its an old dom1 solution that only (through buggy hacks) works with document.write
[04:41:17] <Dr_ST> I have a small probelm after loading a table from a file. I'm using $(#blah).load to load the html table inside my page in the #balh div, but when I want to add it 'tablesorter' it does not work
[04:41:18] <Cork> for modern js you work through references by id's or classes
[04:41:32] <Dr_ST> if I put the table inside the html page, then tablesorter works as expetec
[04:41:55] <Cork> Dr_ST: are you doing the access through the callback?
[04:41:58] <Dr_ST> I suspect a loading race or something like this, but if this btrings something to anyone please share
[04:42:10] <Dr_ST> Cork, nope, I don't think so
[04:42:12] <Cork> if you load the data through load you need to wait for it to be fetched
[04:43:20] <Dr_ST> yes, I think this is where I am stick
[04:43:23] <Dr_ST> stuck
[04:43:59] <Cork> $('#foo').load('/bar.html', function() { /* modify */ });
[04:44:46] <Souvent22> Cork: ok, gotcha. hm.
[04:44:57] <Dr_ST> hummm
[04:44:57] <Souvent22> gotta find a solution another way I suppose.
[04:45:10] <Dr_ST> inside the function, I did not tried this ...
[04:45:29] <Cork> Souvent22: add an id to the target element and use that
[04:45:41] <Souvent22> Cork: here's the catch...
[04:46:14] <Souvent22> It's an ad that's coming in….so the document.write writes some script tag…which in turn pulls an add into the add space ( inside a div )....
[04:46:37] <Souvent22> we want to include with the add a <script> tag that looks for a parent div and adds a class to that div.
[04:47:06] <Souvent22> thus why I can't specifically target it. all add spaces have the same class, we only want it for that ad space.
[04:49:59] <Cork> Souvent22: why not just do <div id="content-area"></div><script src=""></script>
[04:50:45] <Souvent22> more like: <div class="ad"></div><div class"ad"><script>…</script></div><div class="ad"></div>
[04:51:07] <Cork> Souvent22: no the point was add it inside the div
[04:51:12] <Souvent22> When serving ads, you never know which ad is served, thus why we kind of have to put this script with the ad itself.
[04:51:15] <Cork> just have the div as a marker
[04:51:41] <Cork> Souvent22: $('#content').append()
[05:00:42] <Dr_ST> Cork, ok, here is a sample script -> http://pastebin.ca/2337265 and sample date to load -> http://pastebin.ca/2337266
[05:01:15] <Dr_ST> I think this works now, but seems "fragile", very dependent on the place I click to sort rows
[05:01:50] <soee> if i have function(event) .. can i get element that this event belongs to ?
[05:01:53] <Cork> Dr_ST: shouldn't be fragile
[05:02:15] <Cork> Souvent22: this will be the element that its triggered on
[05:02:21] <Cork> event.target will be where i came from
[05:02:54] <Cork> Dr_ST: brw, you don't have a doctype on your page, you should add it so you don't get quirk mode
[05:03:05] <Dr_ST> ???
[05:03:27] <Dr_ST> sorry, I'm not an expert, just using what I think is good, I'm from the pre-web era :-(
[05:03:47] <Cork> Dr_ST: add <!doctype html> at the start of the page
[05:03:48] <Dr_ST> what do you mean by "quirck mode"?
[05:03:52] <soee> Cork, thank you works perfect
[05:04:15] <Cork> Dr_ST: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior
[05:07:08] <Dr_ST> Cork, thanks for the link
[05:07:27] <Dr_ST> it works now, but I don't know why when I click sometimes the sort is not working
[05:07:40] <Dr_ST> it seems to work better in chromium than in firefox, though :-)
[05:07:58] <Cork> Dr_ST: try make a working example in jsfiddle.net
[05:17:21] <lenswipee> hi, problem: i echo an array on server-side and get the response from ajax callback function. How do i then get the strings from that PHP array?
[05:18:26] <lenswipee> say $arr = array('1'=>'foo','2'=>'bar'); echo $arr; exit //server-side
[05:20:56] <Dr_ST> Cork, it works now, the answer I was needing is "put the second call inside the first "function" call :-) before I was just giving it sequentially so the link between both was not working :-)
[05:21:12] <Dr_ST> I tried the jsfiddle.net but the problem was probably the same :-)
[05:21:23] <Cork> lenswipee: json_encode
[05:21:24] <Dr_ST> I've tried *a lot* before coming here, thanks
[05:21:36] <j4c0b1> lenswipee you can call "echo json_encode($arr);"
[05:21:58] <j4c0b1> and get it as json array in JS.
[05:21:59] <Cork> Dr_ST: heh, ya, good hunting :)
[05:24:00] <lenswipee> how to access array in client-side with jquery?
[05:24:09] <lenswipee> once encoded with json
[05:24:31] <Cork> lenswipee: the php should set header Content-Type application/json
[05:24:44] <Cork> and then you will have the array in the callback in the jquery call
[05:25:51] <lenswipee> Cork: function(data){...}
[05:26:14] <Cork> lenswipee: btw don't name your array values
[05:26:27] <Cork> $arr = array('foo','bar');
[05:26:38] <Cork> else you will get an object in json instead of an array
[05:27:04] <BarisW> is it possible to detect a browser resize only for horizontal resize? $(window).resizeHorizontal for instance
[05:27:34] <lenswipee> Cork: can you show how to access object and array in jquery?
[05:27:45] <lenswipee> Cork: quick demo
[05:28:34] <Cork> $.ajax('/url').done(function(data) { for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { console.log(data[i]); } });
[05:29:44] <lenswipee> thats for object i gather.
[05:29:48] <Dr_ST> Cork, (an others), thanks for your time and explanation, gtg
[05:30:01] <lenswipee> Cork: what if data is an array?
[05:30:05] <Cork> lenswipee: no thats arrays
[05:30:12] <Cork> if you do '1' => in your php
[05:30:19] <Cork> you will have to use it as an object
[05:30:25] <Cork> data['key value']
[05:30:35] <Cork> in your case data['1']
[05:30:41] <lenswipee> right
[05:31:07] <Cork> but you REALLY sould be using an array for that data
[05:31:12] <lenswipee> Cork: is it possible to set content-type when you set an ajax call?
[05:31:37] <Cork> lenswipee: you can override it client side, to some degree
[05:31:51] <Cork> but unless you set it server side, the server will send the wrong data type
[05:31:52] <lenswipee> Cork: lets see
[05:32:02] <Cork> so it should be set in the php file
[05:32:17] <lenswipee> Cork: what would setting it on server side look like
[05:32:22] <Cork> uh...
[05:32:34] <lenswipee> Cork: php server
[05:32:39] <Cork> lenswipee: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[05:32:56] <lenswipee> Cork: yeah you probably wouldn't remember
[05:33:05] <Cork> ...
[05:33:12] <lenswipee> Cork: thanks for link
[05:33:15] <Cork> lenswipee: i'm not going to sit here and write the page for you
[05:33:42] <lenswipee> Cork: i got what i need now. thanks again
[05:47:15] <marcules> Good afternoon :)
[05:47:54] <WHTM> I have an xml file structured like this (there are a lot more items in it) http://pastebin.com/sw5kH9aN and so far I've been grabbing items from it fine using $(xml).find('drama title').each(… But i've got to a point where I want to get things based on the id attribute of a <title>. How do I do this?
[05:48:26] <Cork> $(xml).find('#id')
[05:50:12] <WHTM> and if the id is a variable named id, i'd write it as $(xml).find("#"+id).each( ??
[05:53:27] <Cork> ya
[05:53:33] <Cork> but no each
[05:53:37] <Cork> an id can only exist once
[05:54:19] <WHTM> I have 2 instances of the same item, one in the "featured" category, and one in the appropriate genre
[05:54:39] <WHTM> So if I want to grab just the first one it comes across
[05:54:49] <Cork> hmm then you prob need to use attribute selectors instead
[05:55:22] <Cork> WHTM: a dom can only reference one id, the other will be unaccessable through the selector
[05:55:42] <WHTM> Hmm
[05:55:51] <soee> if i return json_encode array as request response,  how can i check how many elements such array have ?
[05:56:09] <style> .length
[05:56:17] <Jon47> yourObject.length
[05:56:19] <WHTM> so could I put.. $(xml).find("drama title #"+id).each(function(){ ??
[05:56:21] <Jon47> yeah, what he said
[05:56:33] <Cork> soee: if its an array .length, if its an object; you can't
[05:56:47] <WHTM> Then it should just grab the one from drama?
[05:57:04] <Cork> WHTM: just #id, no need for the rest, the reference is uniq
[05:57:47] <Cork> WHTM: what you want might be $(xml).find('drama title[id=""]')
[05:57:58] <WHTM> it's grabbing both atm :/ basically I'm saying create a div for each xml object with this id.. and it's doing 2 divs currently
[05:58:07] <WHTM> Ahh ok
[05:58:16] <WHTM> I'll give it a go, thanks,
[05:58:54] <soee> Cork, y respons is for example: {"errors":[["Foo bar"]]} not i want to check if errors is set
[05:59:20] <Cork> ahthen ya container.errors.length
[05:59:27] <Cork> *ah, then ya
[06:02:23] <soee> Cork, do i have to use parseJSON before ?
[06:02:40] <Cork> depends if its a string on an object
[06:02:47] <Cork> soee: are you getting it from ajax?
[06:03:03] <soee> Cork, yes its ajax call
[06:03:20] <Cork> soee: are the server sending json content-type?
[06:04:04] <soee> Cork, response headers: Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8
[06:04:13] <Cork> so thats a no :)
[06:04:23] <Cork> i would say fix your server end to send application/json
[06:08:12] <helly^> Hi. I need som input on an idea I have.
[06:08:53] <helly^>  I want to create a "lottery" system that shows two names when I press a button. I want the names to be saved in the DB for later use (stats)
[06:09:10] <helly^> mysql, php and jquery =  :-) ?
[06:10:49] <computer2000> anyone can tell me why $(window).bind('touchmove', function(e) { ... } does just not trigger??
[06:10:56] <computer2000> on macbook touchpad
[06:11:03] <lejocelyn> hey, I've got a small autocompletion function that I modified a bit :
[06:11:06] <computer2000> click, etc works
[06:11:07] <lejocelyn> http://pastebin.fr/26794
[06:11:16] <Cork> computer2000: try document instead of window
[06:11:24] <computer2000> Cork: no worky too
[06:11:34] <Cork> donno then
[06:11:36] <lejocelyn> I don't know why but the UI object is empty when I tried to select the items from the autocompletion
[06:11:45] <WHTM> because touchmove is a touchscreen specific event I believe. Where are the track pad i mouse events
[06:11:55] <WHTM> where as*
[06:12:08] <computer2000> WHTM: i used the same code for another project and it worked just fine
[06:12:18] <WHTM> Then I have no idea
[06:12:23] <computer2000> only difference now is that im using require.js module pattern
[06:12:34] <lejocelyn> the select and focus don't get the data from the ui object
[06:12:42] <lejocelyn> which is empty actually
[06:12:44] <computer2000> but i dont know why that should make a difference
[06:12:52] <lejocelyn> but I don't understand the reason
[06:13:14] <WHTM> I don't think it should?
[06:14:05] <lejocelyn> else, the script works, I get the data from the json location
[06:14:26] <lejocelyn> it gets autocompleted till the point I try to select or focus on the list of results
[06:14:57] <lejocelyn> from this bit I've got the issue     $( "[name='research_countries']" ).val( ui.item.value );
[06:15:17] <WHTM> computer2000: What was the application of touch move in your previous project?
[06:15:38] <computer2000> to calculate the direction and length of swipe
[06:15:43] <computer2000> WHTM:
[06:16:54] <lejocelyn> what's weird is that the function( ul, item ) gets the data it requires
[06:19:18] <WHTM> computer2000: Hmm I don't know then
[06:19:39] <computer2000> WHTM: np thx ... keeps driving me c.r.a.z.y.
[06:19:41] <WHTM> computer2000: You could do it manually perhaps? Using touch start and end?
[06:20:11] <computer2000> these wont trigger neither... all touch events dont work, only click etc.
[06:20:18] <WHTM> Oh :/
[06:21:38] <WHTM> Have you tested if it's triggering on a touch screen?
[06:22:50] <lejocelyn> You know the part one thing I really hate... it's that PHP concanation operator is "." while Javascript is "+". I always got them wrong...
[06:23:16] <notmoose> hi guys could someone take a look at this code and tell me why the form is not submitting? http://pastebin.com/QNcgQ8Hb
[06:23:38] <gregie156> hey, anyone know how i can get the content of a JS file as text? i tried doing jQuery.ajax({dataType: 'script text'}) but that doesn't work
[06:24:28] <Cork> gregie156: you could try dataType: 'text'
[06:24:37] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a way to return all the child elements of a specific element to return to their original state when the page first loaded?
[06:24:44] <Cork> but you might actually have to override the parser
[06:24:56] <gregie156> Cork, if i do that, i get an empty response
[06:25:04] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: there isn't anything like "the original state"
[06:25:12] <gregie156> Cork, you mean overwrite jQuery.ajax ?
[06:25:36] <Cork> gregie156: ya, was afraid of that
[06:25:41] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Thanks, guess I'll do it manually then =/
[06:25:41] <gregie156> DeltaHeavy, you'd need to save the state first in order to be able to revert to it
[06:25:47] <Cork> jquery follow content-type quite strictly
[06:26:34] <Cork> gregie156: converters: { 'text script': function(data) { return data; } }
[06:26:36] <gregie156> Cork, the documentation sasys that i can convert the datatype by writing a space separated list of datatypes..
[06:26:42] <bgy_> related question, is it possible to "map" a custom content type to a jquery known content type?
[06:26:48] <bgy_> if I use custom media types
[06:27:37] <Cork> bgy_: you might, if you can get a link to the converter function
[06:28:55] <bgy_> Cork, what do you mean?
[06:29:27] <Cork> bgy_: you can give the type and then map it to a converter
[06:30:36] <bgy_> Cork, do you have any examples?
[06:30:49] <Cork> never tried it so no
[06:31:20] <Cork> bgy_: i would suggest diggin in jquery.js and have a look at where it define the 'text javascript' handler
[06:31:25] <Cork> (and the like)
[06:31:55] <bgy_> k
[06:32:11] <gregie156> bgy_, it's called 'text script'
[06:32:20] <gregie156> 	converters: {
[06:32:20] <gregie156> 		"text script": function( text ) {
[06:32:20] <gregie156> 			jQuery.globalEval( text );
[06:32:20] <gregie156> 			return text;
[06:32:20] <gregie156> 		}
[06:32:42] <bgy_> mm I don't get the "text script" key usage
[06:32:46] <Cork> gregie156: don't dump code in the channel
[06:32:59] <gregie156> Cork, is that bm ?
[06:33:09] <Cork> bm?
[06:33:15] <gregie156> bad mannered
[06:33:15] <bgy_> let's say I've a application/vnd.acme.user+json; media type, how would I say to jQuery to handle this as json
[06:33:30] <Cork> gregie156: its bad manner if you prefer
[06:33:56] <Cork> gregie156: and then code is hard to read, and it can be causing clients to die if its a lot of lines
[06:34:12] <gregie156> k
[06:34:14] <Cork> so its just not a good thing to do, use a pb for the code
[06:34:14] <gregie156> sry
[06:34:25] <Cork> no prob, just don't do it again ;)
[06:35:55] <gregie156> Cork, how do i add another converter? if i run ajaxSetup it will overwrite the existing stuff, no?
[06:36:39] <Cork> gregie156: first you would have to look into how jquery splits the types, i don't remember if its hard coded of it it actually parses the content-type
[06:36:57] <Cork> gregie156: and then you would have to define what the key should be
[06:37:31] <Cork> gregie156: 'text script' comes from text/javascript
[06:41:30] <amaroks> Hola
[06:52:28] <soee> if the $.each is in progress code difined after is executed when each is finished or parsed the same time ?
[07:16:57] <Olivius67> Hi All :)
[07:17:11] <juboba> Hi
[07:17:45] <Olivius67> I have a span that is text-center aligned, is it possible to know it's position relative to the left border of the browser window?
[07:18:09] <juboba> I have this code for droppable elements in my page http://pastebin.com/yS3dH8mM  I would like to create elements dynamically (I already have it) but adding the droppable property just the same as this. I don't want to repeat the code because it would be really dumb. How can I do this?
[07:20:30] <DeltaHeavy> I have 2 objects, declared like this: var item = {...}, itemTemplate = item      Why is it when item changes, itemTemplate ALSO changes?
[07:22:04] <seutje> ?g javascript objects by reference
[07:22:05] <b-ot> seutje: JavaScript: Passing by Value or by Reference - Snook.ca → http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass
[07:22:07] <bot-t1> seutje, JavaScript: Passing by Value or by Reference - Snook.ca - http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass
[07:22:12] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: ^
[07:23:47] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: Thank's!
[07:24:38] <ph88> i downloaded Smooth Div Scroller and i'm trying to merge together the JS files it uses in one big file, functionality stops working, why does this happen ?  Sample (working and non working) http://www3.zippyshare.com/v/30205602/file.html
[07:24:39] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: when using jQuery, u can use the statix extend method to easily clone objects
[07:25:09] <seutje> like var foo = {...}, bar = $.extend({}, foo);
[07:25:30] <seutje> add a true as first argument if u want recursive
[07:25:48] <granden> If I would like to make a GET call. to a PHP file. When pressing a link. And Anly want to know when it has succeded. Which way to make an ajax call is "best" if there is any better then another?
[07:26:06] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: Ah thanks, was looking up how to do that but you saved me some time there :p
[07:26:29] <seutje> that's why they call it support :)
[07:27:01] <ph88> All i did between those two version is  Move js2/jquery-ui-1.10.2.custom.min.js   at the end of   js2/together.js
[07:27:12] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: So is there any better way to reset my object to it's default? I'm assuming this is probably the best way?
[07:27:13] <Andrew_R> granden: use $.get(url).done(function(data){ // success });
[07:27:47] <hemanth> :random element selection is possible with CSS selectors?
[07:28:13] <granden> Andrew_R: Ah, that simple. Thanks. one more thing. Is the script is playing with the source image file on the server. Rotates it.
[07:28:25] <granden> Is there a way in the success function to reload the image for the user?
[07:28:30] <granden> So they see that the image is rotated.
[07:29:33] <Andrew_R> usually that is done by appending a timestamp a the end of the URL, so the browser sees it as a different url and reloads it instead of using it from cache
[07:30:10] <Andrew_R> so http://example.com/image.jpg?1363876203
[07:30:34] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: default?
[07:30:54] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: What I created it with originally. var item = {...}
[07:31:19] <seutje> not unless you store a copy
[07:31:35] <seutje> u'll see this often as a pattern in plugins
[07:31:49] <Jester86> hey guys.. is there much of a functional difference between the following lines of code:
[07:31:51] <seutje> they accept an options object and then merge that with a defaults object to create a new object
[07:32:08] <seutje> defaults never change
[07:32:13] <Jester86> $('#ID td')   &    $('#ID').find('td')
[07:32:28] <granden> Andrew_R: Yeah, but I dont reload the page as the rotate is done by an ajax call.
[07:32:44] <granden> So I would need to refresh the image that is already loaded in to the browser window.
[07:34:20] <Andrew_R> yep, that works, you can set the image source something like this $('img').attr('src', imageName + '?' + (new Date()).UTC())
[07:35:44] <granden> So I shoulde remove the current image. And then add a new(the same) using jquery then just?
[07:37:27] <Andrew_R> you don't have to remove the current image, you can just change the src attribute
[07:37:32] <granden> ok
[07:41:18] <granden> rotate.php:17TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '(new Date()).UTC()') - String looks like this $.get('ajaxRotate.php?direction=right&bild=').done(function(data){ $('#cropbox').attr('src', imageName + '?' + (new Date()).UTC()); });
[07:43:31] <boytoy> Anybody know why this ultrasimple jQuery Mobile Panel setup does not work as expected? http://jsfiddle.net/XcmXs/1/
[07:43:40] <Andrew_R> I didn't double check that code, replace (new Date()).UTC() with correct code to return the current Unix time
[07:46:48] <momomomomo> boytoy: I would seriously consider looking over the source here: view-source:http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/panel-fixed.php
[07:46:50] <granden> Andrew_R: Ok, now I just dont understand why the image wont rotate when told so by an ajax call. Works great on a normal link that loads the script :(
[07:47:34] <momomomomo> granden: your code is giving you a php error.
[07:47:42] <momomomomo> right?
[07:48:08] <momomomomo> Or is that from the javascript console?
[07:48:20] <granden> momomomomo: Dont know. But I think I could have found the problem acctually
[07:48:35] <boytoy> momomomomo: But that's what I did!
[07:49:26] <momomomomo> granden: I would step through the JS function to see what method/variable is undefined
[07:51:22] <boytoy> Seems data-role="header" needed to be specified
[07:51:51] <boytoy> I thought that was only for styling purposes
[07:52:32] <momomomomo> boytoy: when something doesn't work, it's OK to try adding/removing things like you just did, to find out what works :)
[07:54:38] <boytoy> Yep
[07:54:40] <Andrew_R> granden: because you're changing the image file, but using the same URL, so the browser doesn't reload it
[07:56:56] <Andrew_R> granden: update your code to this $.get('ajaxRotate.php?direction=right&bild=').done(function(data){ $('#cropbox').attr('src', imageName + '?' +(new Date()).getTime()); });
[07:57:11] <Andrew_R> also, make sure your PHP code is working correctly
[07:57:25] <Andrew_R> oh, does imageName contain the path to your image file?
[08:12:20] <masentinel900> Good morning Guys!!
[08:12:52] <masentinel900> For to take the value of an option of a select input is with .select() option?
[08:20:26] <didiergm> on jquerymobile what is the recommended way to trigger a js call when clicking/tapping on a listview element
[08:20:57] <lejocelyn> I don't get why this function doesn't work : http://pastebin.fr/26798
[08:21:08] <lejocelyn> I try to check whether a cookie exists or not
[08:21:15] <lejocelyn> then just disable some tabs
[08:21:28] <lejocelyn> but, it doesn't affect at all the tabs
[08:21:52] <lejocelyn> should I check the cookies during the beforeLoad option of the tabs ?
[08:25:53] <gener1c> is there a way of changing the default behabiour for all incoming hashtag links?
[08:26:11] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/pC5RU/
[08:26:22] <masentinel900> Guys why always show me "View"
[08:26:32] <masentinel900> What is wrong?
[08:32:57] <Andrew_R> lejocelyn: your getCookie function has a bug
[08:33:37] <Andrew_R> you don't want a else{ return false; } in your loop. if you have more than one cookie and it finds a different one first, x!=c_name and it returns false
[08:34:23] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: Ah true, but it's not the cause of the problem I think
[08:35:27] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: this way it should do http://pastebin.fr/26800
[08:35:54] <Andrew_R> also, you want to move the code that gets the cookie and changes the tabs to disabled inside the $(function() { }) (onready) function
[08:36:33] <Andrew_R> your second pastebin you need to remove else{ return false;} and just use return false; - there is no else there
[08:36:51] <lejocelyn> ... I think I should get some rest :D
[08:37:52] <Andrew_R> :)
[08:40:19] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: strange it disable only one tab after a click on one of the links
[08:41:22] <Andrew_R> you can't disable the current tab
[08:42:10] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: I've got three tabs, I'd like to disable number 2 and 3, if it's start at 1
[08:42:12] <tdskate> $('#menu').AccordionImageMenu({ 'width':300 });
[08:42:12] <tdskate> how do I set the width to equal the with of #menu ?
[08:42:16] <lejocelyn> which I think it does
[08:42:18] <tdskate> width*
[08:42:37] <tdskate> dynamically ...
[08:47:14] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: when you wrote $(function() { }) (onready)
[08:47:22] <lejocelyn> which function did you mean ?
[08:47:39] <lejocelyn> this one beforeActivate: function( event, ui )  ?
[08:48:07] <tdskate> $('#menu').AccordionImageMenu({ 'width': $(this).width() }); doesn't seem to work ...
[08:49:57] <Andrew_R> lejocelyn: I meant the block where you are setting up the tabs, your original code had the cookie checking stuff outside of that block, so it was trying to set the disabled tabs before the tabs were actually set up
[08:52:27] <anew> hey guys how would you prevent an ajax call from running everytime you enter a page?  for example i have profile/username and when the user first goes there the ajax populates the page
[08:52:43] <anew> the problem is if the user navigates away and comes back - they have to wati for the ajax call every single time
[08:55:08] <bil> anew: um.. don't do the call on page load?
[08:55:16] <bil> pretty vague there
[08:55:26] <anew> that's impossible how else would i populate the page
[08:55:35] <anew> everything is loaded via js, nothing server side
[08:55:42] <bil> so then why don't you want the page to populate if they navigate away and come back to the page?
[08:55:55] <anew> ... so they dont have to wait every single time
[08:56:12] <anew> why should they see a 'loading' symobol for 5 seconds everytime they come back
[08:56:19] <anew> nothing in the server database has changed
[08:56:23] <bil> your only option is to implement some type of caching then
[08:56:24] <keirlav87> i'm trying to create a button that will rotate text by 90 degrees on each click - however i also need the text to be resizable, and i've found that the resizable handles do not update after rotation - i.e. the handle for height is actually at the side of the rotated element
[08:56:29] <bil> offline storage
[08:56:37] <anew> yeah, how can i do that caching? any suggestions?
[08:56:49] <bil> what kind of browser support are you looking for
[08:56:49] <keirlav87> so i've placed the text inside a wrapper to allow the resizable instance to still be relevant
[08:57:12] <bil> anew: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/offline/storage/
[08:57:27] <keirlav87> but the problem i have is that the p element breaks out of its wrapper div, can anyone help me find a solution that will keep the p inline to the wrapper element at all times?
[08:57:39] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/Kj4Gp/11/ << is a simple version of my problem
[08:57:40] <anew> have you used this/recomend it or are you just googling
[08:58:03] <anew> wait nevermind, let me read it
[08:58:04] <anew> thanks bil
[08:58:17] <bil> i have not personally implanted html5 offline storage yet, but many web apps are using it these days
[08:58:27] <anew> so this only works with html5 ?
[08:58:51] <bil> http://caniuse.com/namevalue-storage
[08:59:01] <bil> its fairly widely supported
[08:59:20] <anew> cool thx
[08:59:25] <bil> good luck
[09:00:38] <bil> your other option could be building a single page web app so you avoid page loads all together other than the initial bootstrapping of the app
[09:00:45] <johanhar> can someone help. I am trying to put HTML into a jquery object with a string. like this: http://jsfiddle.net/rPNRQ/
[09:01:07] <jokke> hey, how would i write a hover effect so that the link would change color and change it back to the original color when "hovered out" without knowing the original color?
[09:03:32] <keirlav87> johanhar - whats wrong with what you have - just remove the .html() from your console.log
[09:03:40] <anew> yeah that's what i have a singlepage app bil
[09:03:48] <anew> but the problem is i'm using custom routes to have urls like /profile/user
[09:03:55] <anew> so u get this problem
[09:05:45] <keirlav87> jokke - add and remove a class which has a colour associated with it?
[09:06:19] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: I had a connexion issue... still
[09:06:31] <lejocelyn> even though I if (cookieEmail == false) { $( "#user_profile" ).tabs( "option", "disabled", [2,3]);
[09:06:33] <jokke> keirlav87: but that wouldn't animate it
[09:06:40] <lejocelyn> sorry
[09:06:50] <lejocelyn> even though I check at the end of the document
[09:06:59] <lejocelyn> it doesn't disable anymore the tabs...
[09:07:14] <johanhar> keirlav87: I get an error doing what you saw there in my code...
[09:07:29] <lejocelyn> code look like this : if (cookieEmail == false) {$( "#user_profile" ).tabs( "option", "disabled", [2,3]);}
[09:07:34] <bil> anew: yeah i'd say don't mix server side routes and front-end routes if you want the data to persist between em
[09:07:56] <Andrew_R> lejocelyn: can you set a breakpoint and make sure that is running?
[09:08:14] <anew> no i mean i'm using pushstate
[09:08:20] <anew> there are no server side routes it's all done client side
[09:08:51] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: yes, I did the cookieEmail == false condition works
[09:09:02] <lejocelyn> if I do an alert within the {}
[09:09:06] <lejocelyn> I'll get the message
[09:10:22] <b-lew> I need some help with the jquery quicksand plugin. I think I'm having the same issue as this guy. BUT, I have float: left on all of my li elements and its still not working. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10302280/css-bubbling-while-using-jquery-quicksand Any thoughts?
[09:12:13] <Andrew_R> lejocelyn: I updated your pastebin to do the disabling immediately after creating the tabs: http://pastebin.fr/26802
[09:12:30] <jokke> keirlav87: ?
[09:13:22] <keirlav87> jokke ah right didnt realise you wanted to animate it - what about setting data on the element when you hover over it, like $(ele).hover(function() { $(this).data('color',$(this).css('color')); $(this).animate({color : newcolor},1000); }, function(){ $(this).animate({color:$(this).data('color')},1000)});
[09:13:30] <bil> anew: oh well in that case store the data from your api request in a js variable, and just check its availability before you do another request
[09:16:13] <anew> hmmm
[09:16:24] <anew> yeah
[09:16:28] <anew> and set a time limit
[09:16:45] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: it disables only on tab :(
[09:17:32] <lejocelyn> the last one
[09:17:56] <lejocelyn> but if I do .tabs( "option", "disabled", [1,2, 3] ); it disables all of them
[09:22:26] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: I don't understand why it does that
[09:22:30] <lejocelyn> doesn't make sense to me
[09:22:36] <lejocelyn> unless it's buggy
[09:23:07] <Andrew_R> your default tab isn't 2 or 3 is it?
[09:24:01] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: it's 1
[09:24:05] <macmartine> How come this filter isn't working on the select? http://jsfiddle.net/3vJPF/
[09:24:16] <lejocelyn> both of them are loaded with ajax
[09:24:24] <lejocelyn> I mean number 2 and 3
[09:26:32] <Andrew_R> maybe it is reenabling the tabs after the ajax is loaded?
[09:27:18] <boytoy> any jquery committers around?
[09:27:36] <PapaSierra> is there a way to focus an element without a focus event being fired?
[09:27:45] <boytoy> * jquery mobile committers
[09:27:50] <lejocelyn> Andrew_R: I don't know, I'm checking the HTML code just in case
[09:27:52] <boytoy> (just curious if my pull request is likely to be accepted)
[09:29:03] <Andrew_R> PapaSierra: No, but you could bind to the focus event and do event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[09:29:23] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: yeah good idea, thanks
[09:31:53] <keirlav87> when i transform text on click of a button inside a div, the rotated text breaks out of the div element it is contained within, what fix can i implement to prevent thsi?
[09:32:38] <keirlav87> the p element that is transformed is always the full size of the container element (from an end user point of view it is supposed to look like there is no container)
[09:32:49] <recurse> whats best practice for the following scenario - I have a basic ajax navigation, capturing all href's and submit buttons with .on('click','a, input[type="submit"] ..... since I also have forms on these pages, I'm trying to submit the form in question is its submit button is captured in this click. ive tried to next an on('submit', function(){ in the click event, but it doesnt submit the form...
[09:32:51] <recurse> ...and thats clearly throwing sh8t against the wall. Any advice on how to submit forms if they exist, if their form button is clicked?
[09:33:09] <recurse> if it's submit button*
[09:33:20] <recurse> next / nest*
[09:33:34] <keirlav87> after rotation i set the width of the container element to be the height of the text ( if rotate deg is 90 / 270 deg ) or width if rotate deg is 0 / 180
[09:35:09] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: almost there. problem is this: in the case that the element is focussed using TAB it must show a popover. (when you interact with the popover focus is moved elsewhere). when the popover closes i want to focus the trigger element again, so when you press TAB the *next* form element is focussed (naturally). so this means i want to .focus() the trigger element.
[09:35:59] <PapaSierra> so i have it so when you *click* it opens. but now, when i TAB to it, it no longer opens because i've removed the TAB->focus->open instruction
[09:37:55] <Andrew_R> PapaSierra: Why not set focus to the next element when the popup closes? That might be an easier solution.
[09:38:19] <jokke> keirlav87: sounds good, thanks!
[09:38:25] <keirlav87> this is a simple mockup of what i'm tyring to do : http://jsfiddle.net/Kj4Gp/18/
[09:39:13] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: genius ;)
[09:40:49] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: well... it's a little hard because this is a modular widget that should have no knowledge of the page, so selecting the next input could be hard
[09:41:01] <recurse> so anyone on posting forms if only they exist inside an existing on click event handler?
[09:41:48] <recurse> ive tried nesting this (and several variations of submit()) inside the onclick handler
[09:41:53] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: what if i create the widget with a hidden input and give that focus on closing? (if hidden can't be focussed then just a text box that is position left: -9999px?
[09:41:53] <recurse> jQuery("body").on('submit', function() {
[09:41:54] <recurse> jQuery.post(myAction, {'source':myAction}, function(data){
[09:41:57] <recurse> to no avail
[09:42:18] <Andrew_R> you could use .next('input, select, textarea') to find the next input, but that will fail if your widget is the last one on the page
[09:43:45] <Andrew_R> the hidden input will work if it's after the control, if someone tabs backwards though it will cause them to have to hit 2 tabs to get back to the correct input
[09:46:08] <PapaSierra> Andrew_R: ok, hidden input with an event handler for blur and then it removes itself.
[09:46:18] <PapaSierra> and adds itself back when the popover next shows
[09:46:23] <Andrew_R> I like it
[09:50:01] <Olivius67> I have a span that is text-center aligned, is it possible to know it's position relative to the left border of the browser window?
[09:50:41] <davemo> http://jqapi.com/#p=offset @ Olivius67
[09:50:42] <PapaSierra> thanks for the inspiration.
[09:51:11] <Andrew_R> np
[09:51:22] <Olivius67> thx davemo
[09:52:09] <guzzlefry> Is there anything like insertAfter(), but inserts from the nth matched element onward?
[09:53:03] <guzzlefry> I didn't see anything, but I figured I'd check here before I write something on my own.
[09:56:38] <perkabalo> I'm trying to change background color on .hover on two jquery slide in panels on this page: www.gmflm/wp_gmflm, anyone who can point me in the right direction?
[09:57:09] <perkabalo> www.gmflm.com/wp_gmflm
[10:03:29] <guzzlefry> ah okay, nevermind, slice() is what I wanted. :)
[10:48:40] <Phoenixz> I have a text input and some checkboxes under that. I want that if the checkboxes are clicked, that the focus stays on the text input, so I do $(checkbox).click(function(){$(textinput).click();}); but this does not work..
[10:48:46] <Phoenixz> Anybody who might know why?
[10:49:17] <Andrew_R> use $(textinput).focus() instead of .click()

[11:12:42] <psyferre> Hey folks, I've got a site using a slideshow function that works perfectly most of the time, but on some pages it will cycle through the images and then show all of them stacked down the page - then stop running the slideshow.    I know enough to be dangerous, but can't seem to find any problem with the javascript.  Can anyone take a peek?  Any hints would be greatly appreciated.  Code: http://pastebin.com/hX3Kgrwn.  Site: ht
[11:14:34] <tomasantonj_> psyferre: url got cut off, mind to repaste?

[11:15:19] <zfly9> Hey guys I am wondering if there is a jquery fucntion to use if there is a certain color used on an achlor link, to use a certain color on hover... I do a lot of sites where I have to create a handful of hovers (I know I can do this with classes but wanted to see if there was an easy jquery way if I wanted to do it after a site had all the markup)
[11:17:42] <Dr_ST> hi folks (#2)
[11:18:31] <Dr_ST> I'm willing to pass the content of a table to a perl cgi, anyone on this? for now i can get "params" from the input fields, but I would like more
[11:19:32] <shoky> wat
[11:20:50] <Dr_ST> ha, wait, it works, I have to modify the perl filtering then :-)
[11:21:19] <shoky> sure thing bob
[11:27:17] <danlamanna> hey guys - i have this jquery line and it's dead slow on a page with ~600 form elements (don't hate):
[11:27:18] <danlamanna> jQuery("form > button[name='more_data'].meta_button").click(function(){jQuery(this).siblings("div.meta:first").toggle("fast");});
[11:27:31] <danlamanna> is there an obvious optimization i'm not seeing?
[11:28:46] <Andrew_R> danlamanna: it's slow to update when you click the buttons or slow to bind the events?
[11:30:27] <danlamanna> Andrew_R: i'm not sure which part is slow exactly, when i click the button it just takes almost 3 seconds to toggle the div
[11:30:42] <danlamanna> Andrew_R: from console, if i pick a specific button and calling .siblings.... it's very fast to toggle
[11:31:38] <keebler_> So, I work for a company that has developed a WebApp that has 5 separate Apps within it. I'm taking over the program from another dev. This dev has embedded all of the javascript into the main body of the main html page of each "app". From a layout/debugging perspective, I hate this method, but he says he did it to cut down on http requests, I've always been of the school of thought where you separate content from markup and styles... (My Development 
[11:32:21] <keebler_> has/is
[11:32:21] <tdignan> keebler_: 2 thoughts
[11:32:24] <danlamanna> Andrew_R: so i would assume the actual dispatch is taking too long?
[11:32:29] <tdignan> "Yo dawg, I herd you like apps"
[11:32:37] <tdignan> and, welcome to maintenance
[11:32:52] <Andrew_R> danlamanna: how many items does "form > button[name='more_data'].meta_button" match?
[11:33:02] <danlamanna> Andrew_R: 648
[11:34:17] <shoky> danlamanna: read about event delegation, quick
[11:34:24] <shoky> ?on
[11:34:25] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:35:36] <keebler_> I say App, because they execute various server side programs, much like a standalone iOS or Android app would perform. Maybe it's another naivety thing I'm not accustomed to, but is it a faux pas or identify JQM Pages as Applications?
[11:35:52] <keebler_> or/to..
[11:37:57] <keebler> And, in regards to embedding the entire work of javascript into the main .html, what is the main consensus as far as best practices for including js?
[11:38:13] <keebler> For Mobile Platforms that is.
[11:38:48] <ajpiano> keebler: for mobile, cutting down on http requests is a noble goal
[11:39:00] <ajpiano> however, it shouldn't come at the expense of like, application development sanity
[11:39:13] <keebler> ajpiano: Thank yoU! That was my argument.
[11:39:19] <ajpiano> the js should be able to be developed separately -- the final product should be built together
[11:39:58] <danlamanna> shoky: that doesn't seem to really increase performance?
[11:40:02] <ajpiano> the entire app shouldn't be developed in index.html
[11:40:02] <keebler> I suggeted we move the 8 icon images to a single sprite and use data URI for loading, which would do far more than this mess.
[11:40:05] <Andrew_R> danlamanna: I put together a jsfiddle for you to consider: http://jsfiddle.net/pRDmh/
[11:40:08] <ajpiano> index.html should be a build artifiact
[11:40:22] <Andrew_R> danlamanna: this way you are binding 1 event instead of 648
[11:40:59] <whatever_42> hey guys. this is my more then weird code http://jsfiddle.net/xNY2m/2/ . i am using the ajax part to update the entrys underneath #actualSidebar. but after updating the sidebar jquery fires 2 requests at once when i click on an element

[11:41:47] <b-ot> danlamanna: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:41:47] <Andrew_R> sorry, this one, I didn't finish: http://jsfiddle.net/pRDmh/1/
[11:41:47] <bot-t> danlamanna, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:42:07] <shoky> oh sorry, didn't see Andrew_R had a fiddle for you
[11:42:15] <Cygn> I wrote a script, that should jump to a specified anchor when the location.hash changes. Besides, it updates the hash, whenever the user scrolls into a new area. The only ugly thing left, is that you can clearly see the browser working (favico hides etc.) when scrolling into a new area, is there anything i miss, which is way too expensive in my code? http://jsfiddle.net/j7jtN/
[11:42:20] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[11:42:38] <Cygn> If anyone has hints according to mobile support for this, i would be very thankful, too.
[11:43:29] <OliverJAsh> : if i run "$(window).on('scroll', function () { console.log('test') })", then it should fire an event whenever the window scrolls, right?
[11:43:36] <OliverJAsh> well i have a div with overflow: auto and the event doesn't seem to be bubbling up to window. i am scrolling and nothing happens.
[11:44:41] <Andrew_R> OliverJAsh: The scroll event doesn't bubble up
[11:45:08] <OliverJAsh> Andrew_R: oh
[11:48:42] <masentinel900> Guys!, Someone know how pass data from php array to hidden row of datatables plugin forjquery?
[11:49:04] <whatever_42> can somebody spare some time and help me with my problem?
[11:54:14] <tomasm-> hi, if i have an inline onClick handler for a link, is there a way to add a different click handler and disable the inline one? would stopImmediatePropagation() do that? (ie which fires first, the inline or any added later)
[11:56:43] <tdignan> whatever_42: if your testcase isn't reproducing the bug (a log statement is only printing once) then you need to find the difference between your code and the test case.
[11:57:04] <tomasm-> I read that too fast and thought the word "testcase" said "testacle"
[11:57:09] <adavia> anybody knows how can i use more than 1 jquery dialog at the same.. which property should i change in order to open a dialog and avoid getting the background frozen
[11:57:53] <whatever_42> tdignan: well i do not know whether the jsfiddle version produces the same mistake. would it help if i changed it to a version that is able to exchange the sidebar?
[11:58:01] <tdignan> adavia: don't set modal to true.
[11:58:33] <tdignan> whatever_42: nope, nothing can help me find a bug in the code that you haven't provided us
[11:58:34] <adavia> tdignan:  false? or nothing?
[11:58:46] <tdignan> adavia: if you leave it unspecified, I believe it will default to false.
[11:58:55] <adavia> ok
[11:59:11] <tdignan> but you're probably on to something here
[11:59:17] <tdignan> I'd try to spot the difference
[11:59:26] <tdignan> @whatever
[11:59:30] <Andrew_R> whatever_42: I think the reason your code you commented out doesn't work on JSFiddle is because you are using relative paths to your URL's in the Ajax request, which isn't going to work.
[12:00:00] <whatever_42> it is not about the ajax part. i know that this is not working on jsfiddle that is why it is commented
[12:00:20] <adavia> there it goes
[12:00:20] <whatever_42> well here is the complete file. http://pastebin.com/vubHgwcS the part i am having trouble with is the first one
[12:00:21] <adavia> thanks
[12:00:25] <tdignan> well, you said the problem is that the request fires twice, whatever_42
[12:00:33] <tdignan> but when I put a log statement in there, it only prints once.
[12:00:38] <tdignan> so you're missing part of the bug
[12:01:05] <whatever_42> that might be because the sidebar hasn't been replaced
[12:01:32] <whatever_42> this bug only occurs once the sidebar is replaced. once replaced = 2 requests. replaced twice = 3 requests
[12:02:18] <whatever_42> so the amount of requests is linked to the amount of sidebars that have existed
[12:03:40] <tdignan> are you duplicating the id in your sidebars
[12:03:46] <tdignan> id must be unique
[12:04:26] <whatever_42> i did not assign an id. all sidebar elements have in common the .sidebar-element class and the data-type attribute
[12:06:49] <Andrew_R> whatever_42: response.sidebar is just <ul><li>...</li></ul>, right?
[12:06:58] <tdignan> well, the .sidebar will select all of them if you don't further specify.
[12:07:26] <whatever_42> Andrew_R: true
[12:08:12] <whatever_42> tdignan: well but why does it fire 2 requests on clicking?
[12:08:27] <tdignan> because you must be propagating events into more than one sidebar
[12:08:33] <tdignan> do they like, overlap at all?
[12:09:07] <whatever_42> a new sidebar takes place in the spot of the old one
[12:09:21] <tdignan> that's why
[12:09:28] <tdignan> you probably didn't completely remove the old one
[12:10:05] <whatever_42> so something like $(".sidebar-element").remove(); would help?
[12:10:11] <tdignan> yes
[12:13:43] <Andrew_R> whatever_42: look at this updated fiddle, seems to be working ok: http://jsfiddle.net/xNY2m/4/
[12:14:36] <Andrew_R> I would look at the entire response and make sure this javascript isn't somehow getting inserted again
[12:18:39] <Andrew_R> well.. at least it isn't calling the event twice, maybe there is a bug elsewhere, I'm not sure.
[12:19:38] <whatever_42> yet it seems to work on jsfiddle
[12:19:58] <whatever_42> i am trying to apply your version to my code right now
[12:20:45] <Andrew_R> all I did was remove the ajax call and hardcode the values you would get back for the response.sidebar
[12:23:50] <whatever_42> i see. yet i do not see the difference for my code between the hardcoded version and the one with the ajax request
[12:24:20] <Andrew_R> are you saying you get similar results with the hard coded values in your full page?
[12:26:45] <whatever_42> hang on
[12:27:15] <prilax> hello

[12:54:58] <ANNDELL> please help me how to substitute iframe with jquery... i found some things about object via jquery but i cannot remove scrollbars
[12:56:50] <marlonlandaverde> you can try changing css to: iframe { overflow: hidden; }
[12:57:10] <chinoto> ANNDELL: $('sel').load('url')
[12:57:40] <snkcld> in $.ajax().done( function(data) {} ); is data a string?
[12:57:57] <chinoto> snkcld: depends on the type of data
[12:58:01] <snkcld> because in chrome, its an actual json object. in firefox, its a string.
[12:58:06] <snkcld> well, the data returned is JSON
[12:58:29] <chinoto> snkcld: are you specifying json as the desired response?
[12:58:33] <snkcld> but its just strange that in firefox it maintains its type (string), but chrome seems to be doing some extra work for me, and converting it to the JSON obj
[12:58:42] <snkcld> chinoto, i am not specifying that, no
[12:58:46] <snkcld> thank you
[12:58:54] <snkcld> how do i specify that?
[12:59:03] <rael> find('> ul > li > span.myClass')   can you do something like that to find the myClass list item
[12:59:24] <chinoto> rael: don't see why not
[13:00:26] <Theowning> So I've got a fun issue with jquery mobile, I'm dynamically changing the options of a selectmenu from another page and then switching to the page the select is on. I've got pagechange hooked, and when it's called I call .selectmenu("refresh",true); on the select.
[13:00:30] <chinoto> snkcld: {dataType:'json'} in the ajax settings
[13:00:46] <chinoto> snkcld: took awhile since I never use ajax directly, always post
[13:00:57] <Theowning> Problem is, it doesn't actually like to refresh, it's just a blank select, when I click on it the options show up though
[13:01:09] <snkcld> thank you. so i guess my problem was that i was relying on chrome to determine the datatype, but firefox leaves that up to the developer
[13:01:58] <chinoto> snkcld: possibly, but I'm pretty sure jquery handles it
[13:02:35] <chinoto> snkcld: are you making sure to set the content-type before sending it?
[13:02:58] <snkcld> chinoto, once i set dataType: json in the ajax settings, the value passed to done is now in fact json in both browsers
[13:03:04] <snkcld> i did not specify content-type
[13:03:34] <chinoto> snkcld: you should do that to avoid problems, I've got the correct one somewhere...
[13:04:03] <chinoto> header('Content-type: application/json');
[13:04:16] <ANNDELL> chinoto: yes, but i cannot delete scrollbars...
[13:04:19] <snkcld> so Content-Type is meant for the server to use to know what kind of data to send back
[13:04:19] <snkcld> ?
[13:04:26] <snkcld> as opposed to specifying the data being sent to?
[13:05:01] <chinoto> content type is specified by the server so that the client knows how to handle it
[13:06:09] <chinoto> by default, apache uses text/html
[13:07:58] <chinoto> ANNDELL: marlonlandaverde's suggestion should work
[13:09:37] <chinoto> ANNDELL: overflow:hidden is working for firefox (happened to have a tab with an iframe in it)
[13:10:02] <doug4> hi guys
[13:10:12] <chinoto> ello govna
[13:10:28] <doug4> anyone using isotope plugin (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/)?
[13:12:13] <doug4> testing, testing...anyone? :)
[13:12:16] <Zeph88> What is the difference between $("#parent .child") and $("#parent").find(".child") ? Am I supposed to use one over the other?
[13:13:43] <chinoto> Zeph88: either is fine, find is better of performance in this case
[13:14:26] <Zeph88> Leads me to wonder why there are both, but if find() is better for performance, find() it is.
[13:14:38] <chinoto> Zeph88: in THIS case
[13:15:30] <chinoto> the underlying selector engine, sizzle, reads from right to left, so if the right most selector is an id, it will be very fast, but if it is an attribute it could be slower
[13:16:48] <Zeph88> Ah got it, thanks
[13:19:48] <chinoto> speaking of which, anyone got an idea to make this faster? (not that it's needed): $a.find('tag').has(elem)
[13:21:38] <doug4> @chinoto you got any experience with isotope maybe?
[13:21:57] <chinoto> would have answered if I did :/
[13:22:27] <doug4> thx
[13:22:50] <Andrew_R> chinto: does elem have an id?
[13:24:12] <chinoto> Andrew_R: it is a variable containing an element (note there are no quotes)
[13:24:36] <Andrew_R> nvm, i was going to suggest using $a.find('tag:has(#' + elem.attr('id')) but according to the docs the .has() function is faster
[13:25:36] <chinoto> in the actual case "elem" is "this" of an event handler
[13:27:17] <Andrew_R> in that case, can you do $(elem).parents('tag') ?
[13:30:10] <Andrew_R> $(elem).parentsUntil($a, 'tag') may be correct
[13:31:24] <Andrew_R> I don't know if it is any faster though
[13:32:58] <chinoto> Andrew_R: wow, didn't expect something that specific, I would suspect it's got some kind of optimization making it faster than my idea
[13:34:12] <chinoto> I'll have to do a jsperf on it :D
[13:34:37] <Andrew_R> I don't know the underworkings of the code that well. I believe .parents and .parentsUntil work backwards from the selector instead of the other way around.
[13:34:38] <chovy> is this valid? function(){}.bind(this)
[13:35:53] <Andrew_R> maybe the equivalent of looping through elem.parentNode until you get to the top (or match the selector in parentsUntil) - that should be faster
[13:38:19] <chinoto> Andrew_R: well, as I said it's not needed, so I'd rather not put a lot of extra code in (and have maintenance problems), but I do like finding more efficient ways of doing things
[13:39:15] <Andrew_R> if you are running a jsperf now, let me know the results

[13:42:10] <ANNDELL> chinoto: this cannot work for me...
[13:42:48] <Andrew_R> g0bl1n: there is a plugin https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[13:44:50] <ANNDELL> chinoto: try http://toyotatrencin.ncorp.sk/index.php/modely/aygo
[13:46:07] <chinoto> ANNDELL:  I don't see any scroll bars except for the page itself
[13:47:34] <ANNDELL> browser??
[13:47:44] <chinoto> ANNDELL: firefox on linux
[13:47:53] <chinoto> firefox 19*
[13:47:57] <ANNDELL> hm... im trying opera and chrome..
[13:48:12] <ANNDELL> can this work with all browsers?
[13:48:19] <chinoto> should
[13:48:48] <chinoto> the only one I would be worried about is Internet Exploder
[13:48:48] <ANNDELL> could you help me with this?
[13:49:38] <tw2113> my n00b time!
[13:49:42] <chinoto> ANNDELL: what was I doing before?!?
[13:50:20] <ANNDELL> chinoto: sorry, thanks a lot :-D
[13:50:44] <tw2113> this is giving me "expected an assignment or function call and saw an expression" error with jslint, and i would like to use ternary for this case: $('#anonymous:checked').is(':checked') ? $("#asker").prop('disabled', true) : $('#asker').prop('disabled', false);
[13:50:52] <ANNDELL> but im asking about other browsers
[13:51:08] <tw2113> forgive the excessive checked part
[13:52:52] <chinoto> ANNDELL: oh, I don't have them installed, try asking someone else :/
[13:53:02] <chinoto> and it might be different with the linux versions
[13:53:44] <Theowning> Anyone around that has any experience with jQuery Mobile inputs? specifically selectmenus?
[13:53:48] <chinoto> Andrew_R: well that's unfortunate :/ http://jsperf.com/jldshfbvskjdhb
[13:55:23] <chinoto> Andrew_R: CRAP!
[13:55:28] <is_null> hi all, is there any way to prevent a data attribute from being cloned, without touching the script that clones the element ?
[13:58:47] <chinoto> Andrew_R: there we go http://jsperf.com/jldshfbvskjdhb
[14:06:57] <Andrew_R> chinoto: surprising, I thought parentsUntil would be faster or at least similar in speed
[14:07:02] <Andrew_R> stick with what you have I guess :)
[14:07:16] <naturalist_> does anyone have experience using $.buildFragment?
[14:07:59] <chinoto> Andrew_R: same here. added "$(b).closest('div',$a)" which is slightly faster than parentsUntil
[14:08:05] <barryhjames> Trying to replace all instances of a string of text with a different string, but I can't get it to work. http://jsfiddle.net/UV76d/
[14:08:34] <chinoto> I wonder if it's because of using $(b) rather than $b
[14:09:37] <Jester86> anyone use closedxml's XLworkbook?
[14:15:08] <barryhjames> Anyone have any idea why this isn't working?  http://jsfiddle.net/UV76d/
[14:15:25] <chinoto> Andrew_R: having cached jquery instances are only slightly faster than jquerifying an element at run time it would seem. I'm done with it.
[14:16:01] <Andrew_R> agreed
[14:17:31] <Jabberwock> Hi all. I'm experiencing a weird symptom with JQM and iphone with a multi-select using data-native-menu="false". When I'm finished selecting items, it briefly shows them and then clears itself.
[14:17:37] <chovy> how do i set a selected option in a select menu?
[14:20:29] <chinoto> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/UV76d/1/
[14:20:47] <chinoto> barryhjames: you were using a non-existent method
[14:20:51] <Jabberwock> Also data-placeholder="true" doesn't seem to work on multi-selects
[14:21:16] <naturalist_> does anyone have an idea how to use $.buildFragment correctly? My feeble attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/u3efP/
[14:23:51] <barryhjames> chinoto: Thanks a million!  Solved it!
[14:24:02] <sacho> naturalist_, why are you trying to use it?
[14:24:27] <naturalist_> sacho: rendering a very large table
[14:24:55] <sacho> naturalist_, jquery's functions already use it
[14:25:02] <schone> hey, need some help figuring out a good regexp to cover a bunch of cases
[14:25:03] <naturalist_> sacho: instead of appending each row to the table one by one
[14:26:08] <Jabberwock> Also if I have a single select and multiple select with native false, after I choose options from the multi-select - both select menus reset
[14:26:09] <naturalist_> sacho: where do they use it?
[14:26:11] <Jabberwock> Has anyone seen this?
[14:26:47] <schone> got the following window.location.href possible combinations: 1) http://www.example.com/?var=GG123 2) http://wwww.example.com/?a=1&var=http://www.example.com/?var=GG123 3) http://www.example.com/?var=http://www.example.com/?var=GG123.  I need a regexp that would extract 'var', namely GG123
[14:28:13] <Shoutsid> Eurgh.. can't just simply make twitterboostrap's modals resizeable by the looks of it.
[14:28:47] <Jabberwock> Works fine with JQM 1.2.0
[14:28:55] <Jabberwock> JQM 1.3.0 was not tested well enough with iPhones
[14:29:08] <sacho> naturalist_, on append and such, for example
[14:29:11] <sacho> also on parseHTML
[14:30:55] <naturalist_> sacho: I'll take a look! Thank you for pointing me in the right direction
[14:31:37] <chinoto> schone: /var=(.*?)(?:&|$)/.exec('var=blah')[1]

[14:32:16] <schone> lemme try :)
[14:32:22] <schone> thank u chinoto for trying anyways
[14:33:19] <chinoto> schone: you couldn't have already tested it... did you?
[14:33:35] <schone> i just did....
[14:33:36] <schone> no go
[14:33:45] <schone> i just need the contents of var
[14:34:02] <schone> with .exec(window.location.href)

[14:34:50] <masentinel900> Guys why always takes the same value?
[14:35:17] <chinoto> schone: works fine when run from web console on google: /q=(.*?)(?:&|$)/.exec(window.location.href)
[14:35:32] <schone> even if u put in q the full url again
[14:35:32] <schone> ?
[14:35:33] <schone> ie
[14:35:50] <schone> windwo.location.href = "http://google.com/?q=http://google.com/?q=mysearch"
[14:35:51] <schone> ?
[14:36:52] <chinoto> [16:36:23.363] ["q=http://google.com/%3Fq%3Dmysearch&", "http://google.com/%3Fq%3Dmysearch"]
[14:37:38] <chinoto> the characters end up url encoded, but that should be an easy fix
[14:37:56] <ezio> masentinel900, $('#myselect option:selected').val()
[14:38:09] <schone> what i need it to be able to cope with is: ["q=mysearch","q=http://google.com/?q=mysearch"]
[14:38:35] <schone> i need to get the inner most Q no matter if the URL is appended or not
[14:38:42] <chinoto> schone: that output is impossible
[14:39:09] <chinoto> you can't have a bigger capture than what you found
[14:39:59] <chinoto> schone: if that's the case, juse url decode it, save it, and do it again
[14:40:15] <chinoto> should be obvious actually
[14:40:52] <ezio> masentinel900, http://jsfiddle.net/2XwNb/3/
[14:41:06] <schone> okay i was wondering if i was missing a way.... i guess i can just run it twice

[15:11:26] <Max-P> Hi, is there a way to tell jQuery UI to *NOT* move the dialogs in the DOM when I click another dialog? It keeps reseting my scrollable divs, and I don't need windows to be reordered...
[15:12:37] <rael> value is text tho so it's like this maybe?      .parent().text(value + html("<button></button>"))
[15:12:53] <pachet> no
[15:13:03] <pachet> .html() accepts a string input
[15:13:16] <pachet> it just doesnt escape it, which is what you're saying you dont want
[15:13:52] <douxblue> Max-P, I'm not a lawyer, but is it possible to reset your scroll bar locations, such as if you were re-initializing the location of the scoll bar between functions?
[15:14:35] <Max-P> douxblue, yeah, I was kind of expecting to avoid having to periodically store the positions in case the user clicks on another dialog
[15:15:35] <keebler> Anyone know why, after upgrading from JQM 1.1.1 to JQM 1.3.1, data-filter="true" no longer works?
[15:15:43] <keebler> JQM 1.3.0
[15:16:13] <douxblue> Max-p, I'm brand new to all this so don't take my advice too strongly, it just seems that it could be a contributing cause.  Like underlying code sets scroll bars to 0 onLoad
[15:17:10] <Max-P> The setup I have is that there are two dialogs open, think of some sort of filemanager with files you can drag from a window to another. The problem is, jQuery tries to raise the clicked one on top, which reorders the DOM, which in turn makes my scrollable lists go back to top :/
[15:18:34] <douxblue> hmm... sounds -- more complicated
[15:21:44] <o-R-e-N> Can anyone tell me how to go about coding this check-out to allow *multiple* shipping addresses? Even if that just means pointing in me in the right direction :/ Sorry to be annoying; just new to mysql databases.

[15:22:09] <as_> hi. i'm trying the following: loading some content into the inside div, when the load is done, measuring the hight of the inside div, to animate an outside div to adjust to the size of the inside div (outside div is overflow: hidden). this works as expected, but one thing nags me: the size adjustment is only triggered on the second reload. looks like the reloading is done, but the size of the inner div hasnt changed in that moment. code:
[15:23:25] <as_> there is a resize listener plugin for elements, but that one uses polling, and id like to avoid polling
[15:23:44] <douxblue> max-p: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404580/scrollbar-resets-when-dom-is-manipulated ?

[15:27:02] <citizen93> Hey guys, I have a small problem. I would like to have the following (http://pastebin.com/jc4qEmZu)
[15:27:25] <citizen93> However where value.replace("thumbnail/", "") stand does not work
[15:27:37] <citizen93> I thought value was a String type...
[15:27:51] <citizen93> how can I replace in the "value" string the section "thumbnail/"
[15:28:12] <Max-P> douxblue, Yeah, that's not related. I dont manipulate the dom myself, but jQuery does, and I want to stop it from doing that. I want to kill the jQuery UI dialog "raise" thing that puts the dialog back to front, I don't need that anyway
[15:28:45] <Max-P> I will probably have to hack the handlers to reset manually the scroll position of my divs, which is annoying but I guess I have no choice
[15:30:07] <douxblue> as I said, I'm brand new so I wouldn't just take my advice on it
[15:31:13] <tcstar> http://jsfiddle.net/3S5P4/2/  here's a fiddle..  i have multiple tables on one page with this same type of data in it...  I need to hide the Duplicate and preceeding | on all elements but the last one in each table... nothing i'm trying has worked..
[15:32:09] <Max-P> douxblue, Yeah no problem, I just explained why it doesn't work. At least you tried ;)
[15:34:10] <Max-P> I'll probably just drop jQuery UI in near future and only keep the core. This library is buggy as hell and causes me more problems than it solves, so I'll just hack it to reset the scrollbars and roll my own dialog library soon
[15:34:46] <douxblue> or commit a bug fix :)
[15:36:27] <Max-P> But then I'd have to add like a dozen more options just to Dialog, they won't like that
[15:37:13] <douxblue> true true, I cannot imagne how many others are relying on the scroll to zero function
[15:37:29] <Max-P> Not the scroll to zero function, this is a bug
[15:38:03] <Max-P> When you have multiple dialogs open, jQuery reorders the dialogs in the DOM so the one you just clicked in is always the top most
[15:38:44] <Max-P> but reordering the dialog causes the browser to reset the positions because of the redraw, which then causes my divs to scroll bar to the top because they are redrawn
[15:40:26] <Max-P> The UI part is meant to be a full featured set of widgets you can just drop there and "just work", by what I have to do with it causes UI way too intrusive, so I have to fight with it every time to cancel the automatic things it does
[15:40:38] <douxblue> I see, I was thinking, perhaps if the redraw would save the location of the scroll bar... if (scroll.location() !=
[15:41:13] <douxblue> if != 0 then store location for redraw...
[15:41:27] <douxblue> well, over my head in anycase
[15:41:31] <douxblue> afk
[15:41:33] <gaspar|work> Hi! I have about 20 elements and for each I need to do getJSON on page load. Is there a way to do them one-by-one, so when one getJSON finished next one starts?
[15:42:40] <Max-P> gaspar|work, Something like $('.my-element').each(function() { /* Blah blah .getJSON() blah blah */ }); &
[15:44:20] <gaspar|work> Max-P: That's what I have, but that loads them all at a time. I need the loop to stop until getJSON finishes and then move to next element.
[15:47:14] <Max-P> gaspar|work, Then I would make an array of the things you have to process, make a function that processes one, and on the "success" handler I'd recal the same function with index+1, which will process the next request, wait for it, call the callback, and recall itself until the list is done
[15:48:11] <goddard> i have an error I cant track down what do I do?
[15:48:24] <goddard> console.log always reports null
[15:49:42] <Max-P> goddard, You can use debugger; and move up the stack to figure out where the variable got changed
[15:50:44] <Max-P> that way you will at least see by which function you went, and add debugging to those too and ultimately find out where it's changed
[15:54:12] <codezombie> I was wondering if it's possible to bind the load event for all images. For example, every time an image is added via javascript, I need a method to run. I've been able to call this explicitly, however, it feels like I should be able to bind this once.
[15:55:00] <Max-P> codelahoma, $('body').on('load', 'img' , function() { console.log(this); }); doesn't work?
[15:55:08] <Max-P> oops
[15:55:10] <Max-P> codezombie, **
[15:55:26] <codezombie> Max-P: I didn't try on, I was going with bind directly. Will give that a try
[15:55:53] <Max-P> So many people there, got to be careful with tab-complete ._.
[15:56:25] <codezombie> Max-P: yeah, that doesn't work.
[15:56:46] <codezombie> not sure if it matters that I'm loading base64 image source into the src attribute.
[15:57:45] <Max-P> codezombie, Does the regular load() actually gets fired by doing so? Because it doesn't imply any network ressource loading, so I don't see how could "load" be triggered at all
[15:58:27] <codezombie> Max-P: If I explicitly set it to the element I'm creating via javascript, it works. But if I try to globally bind it, it doesn't
[15:58:58] <Max-P> once you set the src attribute, the image is kinda already loaded, why do you need to bind load() on it then?
[15:59:14] <shoky> you can't globally bind to image load events
[15:59:18] <shoky> they don't bubble
[15:59:19] <codezombie> Max-P: I'm using masonry, and I need to do a reload everytime an image is added to the layout.
[15:59:27] <goddard> Max-P: it is null right at the beginning of the function
[15:59:45] <codezombie> ah, damn.
[16:01:07] <Max-P> codezombie, Yeah, you probably will have to call the function yourself everytime. With a good design object that should not really be a problem, but yeah shoky said it, load events doesn't seem to bubble, so you have to bind it manually or just call your function
[16:01:50] <Max-P> goddard, what does the function like? (maybe paste it on jsfiddle or something like that)
[16:04:49] <Fuzai> is there a default on / off icon built somewhere into jquery ( like a red / green light )?
[16:06:09] <shoky> Fuzai: no.. closest thing i can think of is a toggle button in jquery-ui.  (enhanced checkbox..)

[16:52:59] <macbleser> I need it to wait for $(window).load for to run for the first time so all images are loaded and it can determine the height

[16:56:27] <thesisb> macbleser cant know without an actual demo
[16:56:35] <thesisb> Xboi209 wut
[16:57:23] <thesisb> otherj how am i supposed to know what opacityrollover does
[16:57:42] <macbleser> no worries thesisb, i think i can work with what I have for now
[16:58:31] <Xboi209> Like i can do var selector = $(".class"); to cache what jquery found but how do i use that variable with :contains()?
[16:59:45] <thesisb> Xboi209 contains only makes sense when you're doing it right away ie $('.class:contains('x')
[16:59:50] <thesisb> what you want is filter
[17:00:12] <thesisb> given an existing set, filter those who whatever
[17:00:28] <thesisb> rather than find those who contains whatever
[17:03:29] <Xboi209> So i just type .filter("text") to make it the equivalent of :contains()?
[17:04:23] <thesisb> .filter(':even') etc
[17:04:40] <thesisb> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[17:04:45] <thesisb> always just look here
[17:06:07] <Xboi209> Soo .filter(""
[17:06:32] <Xboi209> .filter(":contains('text')")
[17:39:56] <lenswipee> hi, how to check what headers have been set? can it be viewed in html source code?
[17:41:15] <coldhead> you can view the headers in your debugger
[17:41:21] <coldhead> web inspector or firebug
[17:41:36] <d555_> I fyou can use jquery, you can check this lib: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
[17:42:00] <lenswipee> coldhead: im using IE9. can it be viewed in this browser?
[17:42:18] <coldhead> i don't know
[17:42:25] <d555_> firebug
[17:42:27] <coldhead> i don't use IE
[17:42:39] <d555_> even works with IE
[17:43:59] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[17:44:04] <lenswipee> coldhead: i'm returning an echo json_encode(array('activity'=>$activity,..)) to ajax callback function(data){ alert(data['activity']);} //i get undefined
[17:44:47] <coldhead> are you telling jQuery dataType: 'json' so it knows to parse it for you?
[17:45:08] <coldhead> and does the output validate on jsonlint?
[17:46:12] <lenswipee> coldhead: thanks, i changed "text" to "json" and it's now working. Thanks man
[17:46:29] <coldhead> bam
[17:47:06] <lenswipee> coldhead: so now i don't have to worry about headers... unless i got lucky with IE9?
[17:47:26] <coldhead> i generally never worry about headers, life is too short
[17:51:40] <aghouseh> anyone ever run into Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: > (from Sizzle.error)
[17:52:18] <aghouseh> throwing that with this code
[17:52:20] <aghouseh> http://pastebin.com/RBBZjwhS
[17:52:51] <aghouseh> tried a few different methods of testing/setting that var, but i keep getting that error. the arg being passed right now is a jquery object
[17:54:03] <Max-P> aghouseh, try to console.log() what you pass to $(), it probably gets converted to a string like <HTMLElement>#DOMblahblahsomething
[17:54:23] <aghouseh> hmm ok
[17:54:55] <zlobert> hello everybody. im a bit stucked with extending jquery autocomplete but im sure my question is really simple. its described in the gist https://gist.github.com/robert-isaev/3f704dbd8914d75fcffc please help :)
[17:55:18] <obert> impressive: i am doubled
[17:55:23] <aghouseh> max-p: here's the output.. http://paste.nuggetboard.com/image/2U1b3v401U0M of console.log(event, ui, arguments); :/
[17:57:53] <monokrome> I have a library outputting something like: <h2>example here <span>x</span></h2>
[17:58:08] <monokrome> Is there a way to get the value of "example here"? .text() returns "example herex"
[17:58:14] <shoky> aghouseh: that's not what he asked for though
[17:58:28] <RandalSchwartz> clone it, and remove the span
[17:58:34] <RandalSchwartz> then get the text of that
[17:58:39] <monokrome> :(
[17:58:53] <RandalSchwartz> that's trivial though
[17:59:05] <monokrome> Yeah, but I had hoped that there would be a better way.
[17:59:14] <RandalSchwartz> not that I'm aware of.
[17:59:21] <shoky> monokrome: another way is to use .contents()
[17:59:22] <null__> $.getJSON doesn't work locally on Chrome?
[17:59:38] <RandalSchwartz> I don't think you can get JSON from files
[17:59:40] <aghouseh> shoky: oh yeah i see what you're saying.. sec.
[17:59:42] <RandalSchwartz> do you mean from a local webserver?
[17:59:47] <monokrome> contents() does it
[17:59:49] <monokrome> Thanks!
[17:59:52] <monokrome> Thanks!
[18:01:13] <aghouseh> shoky / max-p: http://pastebin.com/aBBMPu6f throws  "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: >"
[18:01:34] <shoky> yeah, but what does it log?
[18:01:42] <aghouseh> jQuery(div.ui-dialog-content✉)
[18:01:50] <shoky> whut
[18:01:55] <aghouseh> heh
[18:02:12] <aghouseh> http://paste.nuggetboard.com/image/0I3S2W2V3H3X
[18:02:19] <aghouseh> er nice tooltip haha!
[18:02:56] <shoky> also.. console.log(typeof node)  o_O
[18:02:59] <aghouseh> http://paste.nuggetboard.com/image/2b2v2b1M3z1d
[18:03:14] <aghouseh> object
[18:03:18] <aghouseh> which makes sense
[18:03:20] <aghouseh> so bizarre
[18:03:23] <shoky> uhh
[18:03:26] <aghouseh> yea
[18:03:54] <shoky> supposed to be a selector string?  a dom element?
[18:03:56] <aghouseh> mind-bottling
[18:03:58] <aghouseh> dom element
[18:04:05] <aghouseh> well, jquery object
[18:04:24] <aghouseh> im passing it by calling my dialog_open($(node));
[18:04:31] <aghouseh> which ive verified IS a dom node
[18:05:22] <aghouseh> console.log(container, typeof container); outputs "<div class="ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content"> object"
[18:06:31] <shoky> is there a stacktrace for that error
[18:07:13] <Max-P> It seems to be thrown by Sizzle, which probably doesn't include the stack trace
[18:07:23] <Max-P> maybe if you enable pause on errors in the console
[18:07:31] <aghouseh> its in Sizzle.error (require-jquery.js:6297)
[18:08:01] <shoky> put a breakpoint there
[18:08:15] <shoky> to see the callstack
[18:08:37] <shoky> or what Max-P said, ya
[18:08:51] <aghouseh> dunno how to do that :)
[18:09:05] <shoky> well, to fix that, see ?ftj
[18:09:05] <bot-t> well, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[18:09:12] <shoky> but umm
[18:09:21] <aghouseh> rgr
[18:09:23] <shoky> what if you just send node and not $(node) ?
[18:09:31] <aghouseh> same
[18:09:34] <aghouseh> i tried that initially
[18:09:39] <aghouseh> since i expected a jq object
[18:09:45] <aghouseh> so just to be safer, i wrapped it
[18:11:28] <aghouseh> ok welp i have the stack trace going but uh no idea what ot look for ;)
[18:11:46] <smftre> I was wondering if there's a simpler way of doing this-> http://pastebin.com/3DLjVtqs
[18:12:06] <smftre> Could I use .not() or something like that?
[18:12:36] <shoky> aghouseh: an anonymous function from your js file
[18:12:57] <shoky> aghouseh: or you could give it a name e.g. dialog_open: function  LOOK_FOR_THIS(event, ui){ ...
[18:13:04] <aghouseh> error() msg =  ">"
[18:13:12] <aghouseh> hm k
[18:13:17] <shoky> what's that?
[18:13:17] <smftre> make any sense?
[18:13:29] <aghouseh> thats in the stack
[18:13:40] <aghouseh> the sizzle error msg im getting
[18:13:51] <aghouseh> my dialog_open function shows this.. dialog_open() event = jQuery(div.ui-dialog-content✉) ui =   undefined
[18:14:18] <aghouseh> so still, showing the jquery object
[18:14:36] <shoky> dont have a live link by any chance..?
[18:14:42] <aghouseh> hm cant.. NDA :(
[18:14:49] <shoky> or can reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[18:14:50] <aghouseh> and im working local anyway
[18:15:18] <aghouseh> i doubt it! it would probably just work in a fiddle ;)
[18:15:23] <smftre> how can I do : if (item is not in json.objlist) {}
[18:17:18] <shoky> smftre: didnt really understand your pastebin.. maybe you wanna take a look at $.grep or $.map  or something
[18:17:31] <shoky> and donno what json.objlist is or has to do with it
[18:19:13] <smftre> shoky: let me try explain better then: I have a json array object that I parse through on a setTimeout, the loops parses and adds elements to the dom, the original json obj array is then saved to a local variable. The next time the setTimeout is run and all this happens again, if the new json object array doesnt contain one of the original elements already added to dom, then I want to remove it
[18:19:23] <shoky> a json array object ?
[18:19:39] <smftre> ....from the DOM, but I have no way of knowing which one until I can compare the 2 array objects
[18:19:41] <smftre> understand?
[18:19:48] <shoky> no
[18:19:48] <smftre> yes, a json array object
[18:19:51] <shoky> not gonna read that :)
[18:20:02] <shoky> make a jsfiddle if you have a prob ;p
[18:20:14] <smftre> good ida
[18:20:16] <smftre> *ea
[18:20:18] <RandalSchwartz> js fiddled while rome burned
[18:20:38] <shoky> and RandalSchwartz was there
[18:22:23] <shoky> no offense <3
[18:22:57] <Wolfed> So, is it possible to avoid .toggle('effect') to turn my selector into a block?
[18:23:01] <RandalSchwartz> well yeah, I'm ancient
[18:23:22] <shoky> adequately so
[18:29:02] <smftre> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/JMDHX/1/
[18:29:05] <smftre> perhaps that helps
[18:29:31] <smftre> the var `original` does not have a value in my realworld, but for demo it does
[18:29:42] <smftre> the commented out area is what I have the problem with
[18:30:08] <smftre> The second time it runs I want it to remove #item_3
[18:30:45] <smftre> make more sense now?
[18:31:18] <lenswipee> is (!data) same as (data != false)?
[18:31:26] <myndzi> no
[18:31:35] <myndzi> (!data) is the same as (data == false) but not (data === false)
[18:31:57] <myndzi> weak comparisons with two ='s are called 'falsy' or 'truthy'
[18:32:31] <myndzi> falsy values are: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN
[18:32:32] <Nece228> hi, .html(data) is to output html, how to output image?
[18:32:41] <myndzi> === requires the type to match as well
[18:32:55] <myndzi> so (0 == "0") is true but (0 === "0") is false
[18:33:06] <lenswipee> myndzi: very good
[18:33:19] <myndzi> .html(data) doesn't exactly "output" anything, it replaces the html content of the element.
[18:33:33] <myndzi> if you wanted to replace the content of something with an image, then give it an image tag
[18:33:43] <myndzi> .html('<img src="whatever">')
[18:34:03] <myndzi> question of my own: what's the reason for this pattern? :
[18:34:16] <smftre> wtf is wrong here?
[18:34:18] <smftre> or rather, how!
[18:34:20] <myndzi> (function ($) { ... }(jQuery))
[18:34:38] <smftre> possible to compare 2 objects?
[18:34:52] <myndzi> ?
[18:35:05] <smftre> as per my fiddle
[18:35:07] <smftre> http://jsfiddle.net/JMDHX/1/
[18:35:14] <smftre> at the commented area line 10
[18:35:19] <shoky> smftre
[18:35:27] <myndzi> oh
[18:35:29] <smftre> shoky:
[18:35:31] <myndzi> you want something like this
[18:35:39] <shoky> ?js var a = {id:1}, b = {id:1};  a === b
[18:35:39] <myndzi> var json = [1, 2, 4];
[18:35:43] <bot-t> shoky: false
[18:35:51] <myndzi> if (json.indexOf(item.id) === -1)
[18:35:53] <shoky> ?js var a = {id:1}, b = {id:1};  a.id === b.id
[18:35:54] <bot-t> shoky: true
[18:36:09] <myndzi> you can only compare object references
[18:36:14] <smftre> ok
[18:36:22] <shoky> ?js var a = {id:1}, b = a;  a === b
[18:36:22] <myndzi> if two vars point to the same exact object, it will be true
[18:36:23] <bot-t> shoky: true
[18:36:23] <myndzi> otherwise false
[18:36:31] <myndzi> jquery has some helpers to do deep comparisons on objects
[18:37:00] <smftre> fail
[18:37:24] <myndzi> ?js [1,2,4].indexOf(1) === -1
[18:37:24] <bot-t> myndzi: false
[18:37:31] <myndzi> ?js [1,2,4].indexOf(3) === -1
[18:37:32] <bot-t> myndzi: true
[18:38:16] <myndzi> if you must pass the json as an object
[18:38:20] <myndzi> you can also create an array from it
[18:38:26] <smftre> http://jsfiddle.net/JMDHX/2/
[18:38:58] <smftre> ^ not quite
[18:39:10] <myndzi> ?js {"thelist":[{id:1},{id:2},{id:4}]}.thelist.map(function (a) { return a.id })
[18:39:11] <bot-t> myndzi: SyntaxError: invalid label
[18:39:15] <myndzi> whoops
[18:39:18] <myndzi> what's that mean i wonder
[18:39:34] <myndzi> ?js ({"thelist":[{id:1},{id:2},{id:4}]})['thelist']
[18:39:34] <bot-t> myndzi: [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}, {"id": 4}]
[18:39:46] <myndzi> ?js ({"thelist":[{id:1},{id:2},{id:4}]})['thelist'].map(function (a) { return a.id; })
[18:39:47] <bot-t> myndzi: [1, 2, 4]
[18:39:48] <shoky> smftre: you can't do  arrayOfObjects.indexOf( someField )
[18:40:01] <myndzi> if you have a direct object reference you can
[18:40:07] <smftre> shoky: so what do I do?
[18:40:29] <shoky> first thing i told you, $.grep
[18:40:54] <shoky> (for example)
[18:41:04] <myndzi> indexOf will be much more effective :P
[18:41:09] <myndzi> you only have to convert the object once
[18:41:15] <myndzi> rather than walk it every time
[18:41:25] <smftre> care to update my fiddle?
[18:42:56] <myndzi> http://jsfiddle.net/JMDHX/3/
[18:43:41] <smftre> thanks
[18:50:28] <Andrew_R> smftre: I have a solution for you where you don't have to map it.
[18:50:38] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/JMDHX/4/
[18:51:16] <Andrew_R> uses the built in Array.some() which returns true if any of the callbacks (the internal function) returns true
[18:53:28] <myndzi> the point to mapping it was to calculate-once test-many
[18:53:31] <myndzi> where the test-many is efficient
[18:54:01] <myndzi> or, preferably, providing the data in an ideal format in the first place
[18:54:06] <myndzi> which is often easy enough to do
[19:17:59] <lenswipee> hi, need help with this test case see http://jsfiddle.net/wbkWJ/
[19:19:18] <Andrew_R> you have the code backwards
[19:19:39] <lenswipee> ?
[19:19:53] <shoky> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wbkWJ/2/
[19:20:09] <shoky> reading the docs helps

[19:20:37] <tw2113> damn, shoky beat me

[19:21:29] <rainabba> I'm having a little logic issue qith .dialog().  I understand that it's async and so can't "return" a value, but I don't know how else one would use such functionality in the real world for confirmations (which is one of the examples given on the site). I need to confirm something with the user and either do, or don't continue execution based on their selection. Am I'm SOL? Seems like a pretty
[19:21:29] <rainabba> obvious need so I'm sure I'm just missing something. Help?
[19:24:07] <lenswipee> Andrew_R: ah,
[19:25:34] <pcavanaugh> rainabba: what you do is you stop your function after you open the dialog and then when the user clicks OK or cancel, you bind a click event handler to those and start execution of a new function. There's no way to make dialog() block like the native javascript functions (confirm/alert/prompt) so you have to think about it a little differently.
[19:26:13] <pcavanaugh> e.g. here is a stack overflow answer with an example - http://stackoverflow.com/a/2881736
[19:27:22] <rainabba> pcavanaugh: Yeah, I was seeing a way to use callbacks to feed my custom confirm() function but then I have to change my approach instead of just update my old code to use the jquery .dialog() so I'm trying to avoid that. Still strikes me as odd, especially since a modal mode is supported (which implies blocking).
[19:29:28] <coldhead> i have missed you, rainabba
[19:29:35] <shoky> modal doesn't imply blocking
[19:29:54] <shoky> well, only blocking access to the other UI
[19:30:02] <shoky> not blocking as in pausing execution
[19:30:03] * rainabba smiles

[20:23:53] <lenswipee> how to see what data is passed in when i do jQuery('select').trigger('change');
[20:49:05] <initself> i have a .click() function that gets data from a textarea with an id like this:
[20:49:06] <initself> $template_content = $("#template_content").text();
[20:49:22] <initself> if the textarea changes on the page, it's not picking up the latest changes
[20:49:27] <initself> how can i make sure it does?
[20:49:32] <myndzi> .change() maybe?
[20:49:58] <initself> ya, but this thing changes....and setting the value takes place inside .click()
[20:50:26] <initself> does click have to get its value from something other than a call to that #id?
[20:50:28] <myndzi> it's a textarea?
[20:50:34] <myndzi> clicks don't input text into textareas
[20:50:34] <initself> ya, it's a textarea
[20:50:44] <initself> i know, the click is on another button elsewhere on the screen
[20:50:48] <initself> it gathers the text from the textarea
[20:50:57] <initself> it seems to only gather whatever is there on page load
[20:51:07] <myndzi> ah
[20:51:10] <myndzi> also use .val()
[20:51:20] <initself> ok, .val()
[20:51:23] <myndzi> i theught you had bigger problems hehe
[20:51:26] <initself> but that's not gonna solve this is it?
[20:52:04] <myndzi> ?
[20:52:11] <myndzi> .text() gets the html contents of an element
[20:52:18] <myndzi> .val() gets the value of an element
[20:52:26] <myndzi> the stuff you type in a textarea is the value of the textarea

[20:52:44] <myndzi> (.text)
[20:52:54] <initself> it is picking up the data that is in there
[20:53:05] <initself> it's just not picking up any CHANGES
[20:53:10] <shoky> did you even try .val()
[20:53:18] <initself> i'll try it, sure
[20:53:49] <initself> bingo
[20:53:54] <initself> myndzi++
[20:53:59] <initself> hrm
[20:54:01] <myndzi> also
[20:54:05] <myndzi> don't put text in the tags
[20:54:09] <myndzi> put it in a value attribute
[20:54:15] <myndzi> it'll be less confusing that way :P
[20:54:50] <shoky> you can't

[20:54:57] <initself> Dear [% contact.first_name %],
[20:55:01] <shoky> that's how you specify the initial value of a textarea
[20:55:02] <initself> that's not text in the tags
[20:55:08] <myndzi> eh? ok
[20:55:16] <myndzi> seemed weird it'd keep both values
[20:55:31] <initself> maybe jQuery treats textareas as a special case
[20:55:41] <shoky> the html contents is copied into the value property, on page load
[20:55:48] <myndzi> i see
[20:56:28] <myndzi> i just set up a neat thing :>
[20:56:44] <myndzi> cache-busting css/js with a generator script that gets served directly by apache if unchanged
[20:56:59] <myndzi> beats the hell out of trying to write your own 304s
[20:57:33] <rmill> BUT WAT ABOUT THE ASSETS IN THE CSS FILES???
[20:57:47] <myndzi> ?

[20:57:57] <b-ot> rmill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:58:03] <initself> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:58:07] <myndzi> they're compiled from less
[20:58:17] <myndzi> and i just had to start breaking things out to make them less awful

[22:16:08] <tootButNotFromTh> hi
[22:17:53] <tootNotFromFlute> Anyone here good at cookies?
[22:19:15] <rmill> tootNotFromFlute: I _LOVE_ cookies.
[22:20:04] <rmill> .g ppk get/set cookies
[22:20:05] <b-ot> rmill: JavaScript - Cookies → http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
[22:20:10] <tootNotFromFlute> rmill: Glad to hear that
[22:20:46] <rmill> tootNotFromFlute: some handy dandy functions on that page you might find useful.
[22:21:05] <rmill> But, an actual question would be good toooo ;)
[22:21:50] <tootNotFromFlute> rmill: Well, I'm really friggin confused in regards to cookies and requests really
[22:21:50] <tootNotFromFlute> like
[22:22:12] <tootNotFromFlute> I need to hear from someone what the best practices are
[22:22:16] <rmill> /o\
[22:22:20] <tootNotFromFlute> not just be pointed to one of many available solutions
[22:22:29] <tootNotFromFlute> google is just giving me stacexchange convos
[22:22:34] <tootNotFromFlute> that dont really end in a consensus
[22:22:45] <rmill> Ok, what do you mean by "best practices"
[22:22:52] <tootNotFromFlute> Yeah so like
[22:23:28] <tootNotFromFlute> If I have a frontend project using JS or jQuery (preferably the latter to the extent that its possible), what is the best practice for setting cookies?
[22:24:50] <rmill> tootNotFromFlute: #1 - You don't need jQuery to set cookies
[22:24:58] <rmill> I mean, there's prolly like
[22:25:04] <rmill> a bunch of jQuery plugins that do it.
[22:25:45] <rmill> tootNotFromFlute: Honestly though, this is prob what you're looking for: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html#script
[22:26:00] <rmill> Those three functions work.
[22:36:53] <tootNotFromFlute> Well
[22:37:00] <tootNotFromFlute> is that the best approach? :)
[22:40:49] <rmill> tootNotFromFlute: I don't know about "best", but I imagine a lot of people use/d it.
[22:41:11] <rmill> PPK is like a big deal or something.
[22:41:18] <rmill> I think he wrote a book.
[22:42:03] <b1lly> hey coldhead
[22:44:17] <tootNotFromFlute> rmill: Well, look, I don't mean to sound belligerent here and I know I'm not entitled to help, but I'm not looking for a definition/manual page nor a book. I learn by doing, but it would be very nice to just have someone explain in maybe 3 sentences the best approach to this thing
[22:44:24] <tootNotFromFlute> Again, you guys and gals are the best for even taking the time
[22:44:29] <tootNotFromFlute> but IMO this would be the most helpful way
[22:45:57] <shoky> why do you need to set cookies?
[22:46:24] <lenswipee> shoky: because the cookie monster loves them.
[22:46:32] <shoky> truf
[22:46:46] <coldhead> hey b1lly
[22:46:54] <b1lly> coldhead: check it out
[22:46:59] <b1lly> http://trubbles.com
[22:47:52] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: Session request via http
[22:48:13] <shoky> tootNotFromFlute: session cookies should be set by the server
[22:48:27] <shoky> with http headers
[22:49:16] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: On behalf of the client?
[22:49:49] <shoky> donno what that means
[22:50:54] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: The user's session token should be stored server-side instead of client-side?
[22:51:52] <rmill> ...
[22:52:14] <rael> anyone savvy on jquery ajax calls in .net ?
[22:52:18] <shoky> tootNotFromFlute: not sure whatcha mean..
[22:52:38] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: you said "session cookies should be set by the server with http headers"
[22:52:48] <tootNotFromFlute> but once its set, then what are you going to do with the headers?
[22:52:50] <neil__> Hi guys, was wondering if anyone could help me with a jQueryUI draggable-droppable issue .. <Problem: I am dynamically creating two <divs> and making them draggable .. When they show up on the page I am able to drag them around .. However, when I try to drop them on a pre-designated drop area on my page .. only the <div> that is a child of a particular third <div> gets "dropped" .. > Can't for the life of me figure out why?
[22:52:54] <tootNotFromFlute> i suppose fetch them via js?
[22:52:59] <tootNotFromFlute> from clientside?
[22:53:45] <shoky> tootNotFromFlute: what? the http headers are part of the http packets.. js doesn't need to know about it
[22:54:21] <tootNotFromFlute> so how is the cookie set clientside then?
[22:54:41] <shoky> tootNotFromFlute: once the server sets the cookie, the client will automatically store it and put it in any futher http requests
[22:54:48] <shoky> further
[22:54:48] <lenswipee> shoky: when you send a http request it consists of a http header and http body
[22:55:54] <lenswipee> toothrot: the header tells what to do with the http body

[22:58:05] <shoky> `demo @ neil__
[22:58:08] <b-ot> neil__: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:58:13] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: Okay so you're essentially talking about eliminating JS altogether and just setting session cookies via a server side lang?
[22:59:16] <shoky> tootNotFromFlute: that's how it's commonly done. usually the server side lang/framework will take care of the cookie for you, you just need to talk to the session API
[23:00:21] <tootNotFromFlute> shoky: Ok I understand. In this case though I'm remotely connecting to an API with JS
[23:00:26] <tootNotFromFlute> so thats why im using JS in this case
[23:01:37] <Cork> uh... session cookies doens't have to be set by the server...
[23:01:59] <Cork> session cookies is just a normal cookie without a expiration date
[23:03:29] <lenswipee> Cork: all session cookies have exp date.
[23:03:48] <Cork> lenswipee: uh, no that is what makes them session cookies
[23:04:07] <Cork> a session cookie is removed when the browser removes the session, not by a time or date
[23:04:29] <[M]adman> http://codepad.org/KvY7Pc7n
[23:04:39] <Cork> ex. if the session is kept alive for a week the cookie will too
[23:04:54] <tootNotFromFlute> Cork: Why do you prefix your messages with "uh"
[23:04:54] <[M]adman> my current progress with the strip_tags alternative (PHP)
[23:05:02] <[M]adman> thats for you, DeltaHeavy
[23:05:04] <tootNotFromFlute> you're not a superior being. :)
[23:05:09] <tootNotFromFlute> we love you anyway
[23:05:39] <Cork> tootNotFromFlute: i'm just a bit suppriced when what you say isn't even close to how it works
[23:06:01] <tootNotFromFlute> Cork: I actually have no clue what youre objecting to here
[23:06:10] <lenswipee> Cork: but you can specify an exp. date of course
[23:06:25] <neil__> b-ot: Thnx .. shall do
[23:14:31] <neil__> b-ot: Just figured it out
[23:15:27] <vladikoff> b-ot, thanks
[23:15:48] <neil__> b-ot: picking a draggable from a div where "float: left" works .. but picking a draggable from "float: none" didnt work
[23:16:49] <neil__> b-ot: so googled a bit and set " tolerance: 'touch' " on my drop-zone and now it works
[23:16:53] <Cork> tootNotFromFlute: a session cookie by definition, is a cookie without an expiration date; if you set an expiration date, its a normal cookie
[23:17:07] <Cork> tootNotFromFlute: if you set the cookie from the server or through js doesn't matter
[23:17:22] <Cork> THAT is what i'm objecting to
[23:18:08] <Cork> the only thing that matters when it comes to server and js cookie is if the cookie has http only
[23:18:16] <neil__> b-ot .. this does seem weird though and non-intuitive
[23:18:45] <Cork> neil__: b-ot is a bot, it's message is triggered by someone else
[23:18:57] <coldhead> b-ot: is that true?
[23:18:57] <b-ot> coldhead: ask again later.
[23:19:01] <coldhead> fine
[23:19:04] <Cork> lol
[23:19:11] <vladikoff> neil__, Cork is also a bot, careful
[23:19:50] <neil__> lol
[23:20:34] <neil__> well would any of U  "b -ot" s be able to explain why it works the way it does ?
[23:21:44] <Cork> neil__: might be that your draggable selectors isn't matching the correct element, but not sure
[23:22:18] <Cork> neil__: a demo of the problem would help, and i think that is what someone asked for before
[23:22:27] <tab1293> if I am using autocomplete to request data from a php script by just entering a url into the source option, how do i form this returned data so it can be displayed correctly in the dropdown list?
[23:23:01] <louism2_> Hey everyone, I am wondering about how to handle a failed 'get' ajax request.  I see that there is a 'fail' method that I can chain onto the get call but I guess I don't understand what exactly constitutes a 'failed' request.  What will trigger that fail method?  Thanks.
[23:24:03] <Cork> tab1293: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[23:24:47] <Cork> louism2_: if the server returns something other then a 3xx or 2xx http status
[23:24:57] <Cork> louism2_: or if jquery fails to parse the response
[23:25:02] <louism2_> Cork: Awesome, thanks
[23:25:12] <tootNotFromFlute> Cork: I never said I wanted to do one or the other
[23:25:16] <tootNotFromFlute> :)
[23:25:33] <tab1293> Cork: okay so it should just be returned in an array of names to be displayed?
[23:25:34] <Cork> tootNotFromFlute: never said you did
[23:25:47] <Cork> tab1293: thats one of the options yes
[23:26:16] <Cork> tootNotFromFlute: but it was stated in here that 1. session cookies is for server responses, and 2. that session cookies has an expiration date
[23:26:23] <Cork> and both are wrong
[23:27:27] <tab1293> Cork well my end goal is to be able to manipulate the drop down menu to contain multiple elements (ie a name and a picture). I'm assuming i should have the source option be set to a callback in this case
[23:28:12] <tootNotFromFlute> ok
[23:28:24] <Cork> tab1293: check http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[23:28:40] <Cork> (click the view source link)
[23:30:43] <tab1293> Cork: okay but the data can't be styled in the actual list?
[23:30:51] <tab1293> as the results come in
[23:30:55] <Cork> tab1293: sure it can
[23:31:06] <Cork> the _renderItems function at the bottom
[23:31:31] <Cork> styling should happen from you css file
[23:31:52] <Cork> adding the additional elements and content should happen in that function
[23:33:18] <tab1293> okay i see

[23:40:11] <maskio> hello
[23:40:44] <maskio> i have a chaining combobox but, how do i set the values on load?
[23:40:55] <maskio> ex.
[23:41:20] <maskio> select region <- lets say i set it to region 1
[23:41:31] <maskio> how do i trigger it on load to load province?
[23:41:53] <Cork> binding a change event to the select box?
[23:41:53] <maskio> if i clicked it manually, everything is fine
[23:42:02] <maskio> on load
[23:42:05] <Cork> ah
[23:42:09] <maskio> this is if user edits info
[23:42:10] <Cork> trigger('change')
[23:42:33] <maskio> its not loading my city;s
[23:42:49] <Cork> what event are you using to do the change normally?
[23:42:52] <maskio> region->province->city
[23:42:58] <maskio> .change
[23:43:17] <Cork> and there is a value selected in the box?
[23:43:22] <maskio> yes
[23:43:43] <maskio> i call an ajax to load the next box
[23:43:52] <Cork> ah
[23:43:56] <maskio> if i manually click it, its fine
[23:44:00] <maskio> they load normally
[23:44:12] <Cork> you need to call the trigger after the content has been added to the dom
[23:44:24] <Cork> so by load you mean $().load('url'
[23:44:27] <Cork> ); ?
[23:44:29] <maskio> how do i call the trigger?
[23:44:44] <Cork> (thought you mean the event listener)
[23:44:48] <maskio> w8 i paste my code on pastebin
[23:45:30] <maskio> im new to jquery, im still on the learning process
[23:45:59] <tab1293> what is wrong with this code, im getting an undefined function for autocomplete.data
[23:46:22] <Cork> tab1293: you need to show the code :)
[23:47:16] <tab1293> http://pastebin.ca/2338049
[23:47:49] <coldhead> maskio: it's my first day :D
[23:48:56] <maskio> XD
[23:49:05] <maskio> http://pastebin.com/rhsp1EGP
[23:49:06] <tab1293> forgot the o in auto
[23:49:14] <maskio> please take time to look at my code
[23:49:14] <Cork> tab1293: hmm, not sure why that doesn't work for you...
[23:49:33] <maskio> my code works fine, if user clicks the select box
[23:49:39] <tab1293> Cork: misspelled autocomplete
[23:49:48] <maskio> province municipality ang barangay loads fine
[23:50:02] <maskio> but how do i fill the boxes if they are now on edit mode?
[23:50:05] <Cork> tab1293: heh :D
[23:51:02] <maskio> dont mind my closing curly braces, the code works fine
[23:51:29] <maskio> its, like, if the user now clicks edit, i would load the information to those boxes
[23:51:36] <Cork> maskio: are you adding any select elements through the ajax call?
[23:51:48] <maskio> yes
[23:51:52] <maskio> via ID
[23:52:10] <Cork> those elements won't be covered by the selectors at the top
[23:52:27] <Cork> as those bind to explicit elements, not future existance
[23:52:43] <maskio> no, i have a selector
[23:52:49] <maskio> i only throw the option
[23:53:09] <maskio> selectors are static on my page
[23:53:14] <maskio> i just empty the selector
[23:53:14] <Cork> maskio: what where is the load your talking about?
[23:53:16] <maskio> and refill it
[23:54:03] <maskio> ex. i want to set region to id = 01 and province to id = 0123 and barangay = 012320
[23:55:35] <maskio> page loads -> region is filled -> trigger select -> load province -> trigger select -> load city
[23:55:42] <maskio> its something like that
[23:56:04] <maskio> or is there a better way?
