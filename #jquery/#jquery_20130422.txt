[01:02:35] <Trudko> Hey guys what is advantage of dropping older IE versions in new jquery?
[01:10:56] <moijk_> less code?
[01:12:22] <Trudko> moijk_: and does that matter? Maybe easier maintaince and faster load , not sure if that make such a big change.
[01:14:16] <moijk_> Can't keep supporting everything forever.
[01:16:26] <moijk_> oh great, they have dropped for ie6 to ie8, now thats something!
[01:19:56] <Cork> moijk_: the 2.0 lib was meant to much less hacky
[01:20:30] <Cork> though while implementing it; it's been found that not that many hacks can be removed, cause webkit is too broken
[01:20:52] <Cork> and that's why 2.0 is still not released yet
[01:21:23] <moijk_> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/ <- no?
[01:21:33] <Cork> oh
[01:21:42] <Cork> well that info was from last week :)
[01:21:55] <Cork> didn't know they finally released it
[01:22:07] <moijk_> android 2.x webkit weakest link. well, good riddans of android 2.x too
[01:22:39] <Cork> moijk_: 2.0 and 1.9 was meant to be released at fairly the same time
[01:22:49] <Cork> and the support is meant to go side by side
[01:22:58] <Cork> where 2.0 is a cleaned up version of 1.9
[01:24:20] <seutje> these fuckers are quick ;)
[01:37:47] <nobitanobi> I used to use .live as a handler that will take into account elements that would be added in the future. It says that is deprecated, so I am wondering what should I use instead?
[01:38:06] <fabioportieri> nobitanobi: .delegate
[01:38:20] <nobitanobi> fabioportieri, what about .on ?
[01:38:36] <fabioportieri> on is the corresponding of bind
[01:38:40] <Cork> no
[01:38:48] <nobitanobi> fabioportieri, ok thank you
[01:38:51] <Cork> nobitanobi: .on is a collection command it supports delegate, bind, and all the like
[01:38:58] <fabioportieri> oh, sorry then
[01:39:19] <Cork> on('event', 'selector') === delegate('selector', 'event')
[01:39:21] <fabioportieri> i didn't knew that
[01:39:28] <Cork> delegate even calls on internally
[01:39:46] <fabioportieri> so why the need for delegate if it's a wrapper for on?
[01:39:57] <Cork> delegate is almost as old as live
[01:40:12] <nobitanobi> So, I should put 'on' or 'delegate' in a parent object right?
[01:40:17] <Cork> and as it's a simple wrapper (one line of code) to support it, there is no need to remove it
[01:40:22] <Cork> nobitanobi: yes
[01:40:25] <fabioportieri> ah i see
[01:40:38] <nobitanobi> ok Cork, thanks
[01:41:18] <Cork> fabioportieri:  this is the entierty of delegate => delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, selector, data, fn ); }
[01:41:30] <Cork> :)
[01:41:49] <Cork> not really a tough burden to bare for backwards support :D
[01:45:29] <fabioportieri> indeed Cork
[01:46:34] <SackyBoy278>  i dont know if you guys can answer this but... does anyone know how i can get a full screen (height and width) header on my webpage. i should contain a scalable image only and i only want it to be fullscreen until the user scrolls the page then it should "scroll away"... any suggestions how i can do? thanks!
[01:48:00] <Cork> SackyBoy278: position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;
[01:48:48] <Cork> he problem is offsetting the rest of the page with the hight of the header
[01:48:56] <Cork> *height
[01:52:40] <SackyBoy278> thanks cork, yeah i have tried a lot of different methods... but it seems to be very hard... =/
[01:52:51] <hanuman> hi
[01:53:12] <Cork> SackyBoy278: it comes from the fact that the web standard isn't built to support 100% height
[01:53:22] <Cork> SackyBoy278: there is other ways though
[01:53:52] <hanuman> how can i write drag and drop icon functionality in jquery
[01:56:18] <ladislaw> missing ")" after condition? => if( e.type == 'keyup' && e.keyCode !- 27)
[01:56:26] <ladislaw> hmm
[01:56:26] <Cork> SackyBoy278: http://www.webdevout.net/test?04Y
[01:56:37] <SackyBoy278> cork: I've tried to achive something like this: http://www.platetheslate.com/ but with a scaleable "image"
[01:56:53] <SackyBoy278> thanks, i will look it up
[01:56:55] <Cork> ladislaw: !- isn't a valid operator
[01:57:13] <ladislaw> ah
[01:57:18] <ladislaw> should be =
[02:07:29] <SackyBoy278> Cork: If you have the time, can you check we this doesnt work... how can i get the image "scaled" in the width? thank you a lot for the help... http://www.webdevout.net/test?04Y
[02:08:06] <Cork> SackyBoy278: i think you forgot to save
[02:08:13] <SackyBoy278> oh sorry :)
[02:08:18] <Cork> it generates a new "temporary url"
[02:08:36] <SackyBoy278> http://www.webdevout.net/test?0J&raw
[02:10:12] <Cork> SackyBoy278: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0K
[02:10:20] <Cork> background-image isn't scaled by default
[02:10:32] <Cork> and not all browsers support background-size
[02:10:39] <Cork> (yet)
[02:10:51] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/background-size#Browser_compatibility
[02:10:51] <SackyBoy278> okay, i will look it up, thanks once again :)'
[02:11:12] <Cork> SackyBoy278: if you want best support use an img instead
[02:11:44] <Cork> really only a problem if you need support for ie8 and lower
[02:12:08] <Trudko> Cork and why did they drop support of older IE_
[02:12:17] <Cork> Trudko: they didn't
[02:12:28] <Cork> they have released two coexisting versions
[02:12:28] <Trudko> Cork: in 2.0..
[02:12:42] <Cork> 1.9, and a slimmed down version of 1.9 => 2.0
[02:13:00] <Cork> both uses the same api, both supports the same plugins, both will have the same support range
[02:13:15] <Cork> 2.0 is smaller, cause it dropped a few old ie fixes
[02:13:18] <Cork> that's it
[02:13:34] <Trudko> whats advantage of dropping ie fixes?
[02:13:42] <Cork> 2.0 is smaller, cause it dropped a few old ie fixes <--
[02:13:49] <Cork> 12% download size
[02:14:04] <Cork> and a speedier lib cause it doesn't have to execute the checks for old ie
[02:14:55] <Trudko> I would be courious about tests what differences does it make in real life app. I guess it also makes development of new features easier. Thats seems to me like best reason
[02:15:05] <amaroks> Hello
[02:15:21] <amaroks> is there any example for Next/Prev? for set of divs?
[02:15:24] <Cork> Trudko: the real reason for 2.0 is looking a head a year+
[02:15:41] <Cork> Trudko: cause when winxp dies, ie8 and below dies
[02:15:55] <Cork> and then it's nice to have an optimized lib for that state
[02:16:06] <Cork> and that is jquery 2.0
[02:16:20] <Trudko> makes sense
[02:16:44] <Gazpacho> ie8 will live on in vms
[02:16:48] <amaroks> Whats the best way to show() and hide() next and prev div ? say I have 10 divs and want to go through them all
[02:17:00] <Gazpacho> as will ie6 in fact
[02:17:14] <Cork> Gazpacho: i rarely ever run ie6 nowdays
[02:17:26] <Cork> it's too much fight for too little gain
[02:17:36] <Cork> and ie7 is slowly going down the same drain
[02:17:41] <Gazpacho> but VMs are only used for specific sites that require it
[02:18:01] <SackyBoy278> Cork: I'm sorry for all my questions... i've tried to implement this to my page... but i guess i do something wrong... if you have the time, plz check this to see whats wrong.... http://www.webdevout.net/test?0L&raw
[02:18:19] <Cork> Gazpacho: i haven't seen many sites that demand ie; and none that demand ie6 (for the last many years)
[02:18:31] <Gazpacho> amaroks: the next or prev div is just one div, how do you get 10?
[02:18:48] <Gazpacho> cork: they're corporate intranet sites
[02:19:13] <Gazpacho> or government intranet
[02:19:21] <Cork> Gazpacho: yes, but even they are getting replaced; mainly cause of microsoft's push
[02:19:50] <Cork> SackyBoy278: you're not setting your html to height: 100%
[02:19:59] <Gazpacho> cork: vmware has a whole business of virtualizing old IE versions, they'll stay around for a while
[02:20:19] <amaroks> Gazpacho: http://jsfiddle.net/BjtNP/ here is the simple HTMl, I need the next and pre buttons to change class of an elemt (next/prev) node
[02:20:24] <Cork> Gazpacho: not in a form that matters to the open web
[02:20:47] <SackyBoy278> cork: should i create a html {height: 100%} or can i do it in the body tag in the css?
[02:21:00] <Cork> SackyBoy278: in the css
[02:21:47] <SackyBoy278> so i can to like html {height: 100%;} and then the rest of the css... body {blah blah...}
[02:22:09] <Cork> "i can to like" ??
[02:22:15] <Cork> can do like?
[02:22:31] <SackyBoy278> sorry, i meant do like :)
[02:22:55] <Cork> SackyBoy278: just add html { height: 100%; } just above the body {} section
[02:23:10] <SackyBoy278> thanks a lot :)
[02:23:11] <Cork> the position doesn't really matter, but it fits there  :)
[02:23:50] <amaroks> Gazpacho: any chance of assistance? thanks :)
[02:29:59] <Gazpacho> amaroks: var $selected = $('.active'); $selected.removeClass('active'); if($selected.next().isEmpty()) $('msg').first().addClass('active'); else $selected.next().addClass('active');
[02:30:29] <Gazpacho> .msg
[02:30:57] <Cork> amaroks: http://jsfiddle.net/BjtNP/3/
[02:31:35] <Cork> opps missed one http://jsfiddle.net/BjtNP/4/
[02:32:35] <Cork> and with some pretty css http://jsfiddle.net/BjtNP/5/
[02:32:47] <SackyBoy278> cork: hi again lol... :) one stupid question... i think got something wrong in my brain today... but can you see if there's something wrong in the code, or why doesn't the image show up? =/
[02:32:50] <SackyBoy278> http://www.webdevout.net/test?0M
[02:34:28] <Gazpacho> oh thanks for hanging my browser
[02:35:00] <Gazpacho> but i don't know anyway
[02:37:23] <Cork> SackyBoy278: i miss read the width: 100% as height: 100% :D
[02:37:28] <Cork> you need height on body too http://www.webdevout.net/test?0N
[02:38:06] <Cork> SackyBoy278: in css an element can't have height: xx% unless the parent is percent or a fixed size
[02:38:24] <Cork> SackyBoy278: so for that to work with dynamic height both html and body has to have height: 100%;
[02:39:06] <SackyBoy278> okay, i see i got it now :)
[02:39:10] <SackyBoy278> thanks a lot for the help :)
[02:39:21] <Cork> the image doesn't scroll though >_>
[02:39:35] <Cork> nice effect, but not sure if it's what you expected
[02:41:08] <SackyBoy278> cork: it's almost what i want, but it would be perfect if the scroll doesn't "cut" the image... do you know how i can do that? :) you are my hero today :)
[02:41:40] <Cork> i think it's the scale effect
[02:44:04] <Cork> SackyBoy278: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0O
[02:44:20] <Cork> SackyBoy278: you WILL have to check for compatibility in browsers though
[02:44:36] <SackyBoy278> wow, you are amazing!
[02:44:56] <Cork> not really, it's basic css
[02:45:51] <Cork> uh...
[02:45:53] <Cork> wait...
[02:46:02] <Cork> SackyBoy278: the fixed comes from your backgrund line :D
[02:46:09] <Cork> didn't notice that until now
[02:46:23] <Cork> no-repeat center center fixed; <--
[02:46:45] <SackyBoy278> cork: oooh okay! should i remove that or...? :)
[02:46:53] <Cork> http://www.webdevout.net/test?0P a cleaner fix
[02:47:10] <Cork> except i left an extra ; ...
[02:47:35] <SackyBoy278> cork: sweet! :) you are a freakn genious! you should work with this stuff haha :)
[02:47:45] <Cork> ...
[02:47:47] <Cork> i do...
[02:47:53] <Cork> >_>
[02:48:35] <SackyBoy278> hahaha i thought so, i was justk idding haha ;)
[02:49:04] <Cork> SackyBoy278: brw, this time it was kinda simple
[02:49:19] <Cork> but for future reference, when you have css problems ask them in #css
[02:49:23] <deepy> I have a table I want to slideToggle in and out, it works just fine but I want it to start hidden
[02:49:25] <SackyBoy278> cork: haha i guess all my questions are kinda a simple :)
[02:49:41] <deepy> applying display: none; has the side effect of the <table> being invisible
[02:49:56] <Cork> SackyBoy278: that wasn't really the point, i meant it was simple, so i just helped you fix it here
[02:50:04] <Cork> SackyBoy278: but it really belonged in #css
[02:50:38] <Cork> deepy: opacity: 0; and .animate instead of toggle ?
[02:50:59] <SackyBoy278> cork: im very thankful :) have a nice day... i will probably be here with new questions after the lunch lol :)
[02:51:43] <Cork> deepy: .animate({ opacity: 0 }, 300); /* hide */ .animate({ opacity: 1 }, 300); /* show*/ css('opacity', 0); /* hide without animation */
[02:51:57] <deepy> Actually, this seems to be a bug with my site
[02:51:58] <Cork> SackyBoy278: heh, yw
[02:52:09] <deepy> also with opacity 0, won't the element still take up place in the site?
[02:52:25] <Cork> uh, wasn't that the point of the question?
[02:52:25] <SackyBoy278> cork: if i want no margin top and left of the image, i guess i will write header {margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom; 0px;...}?}
[02:52:49] <Cork> SackyBoy278: check the original testcase i have you; specially the css tab
[02:52:55] <Cork> *i gave
[02:53:10] <deepy> The problem I'm having is that when I use display: none; the table never shows up, no matter what toggled state it has
[02:53:31] <Cork> deepy: you mean you set display: none; in the css file?
[02:53:36] <SackyBoy278> cork: THANKS :)
[02:53:36] <deepy> yes
[02:53:44] <Cork> deepy: use .hide() instead
[02:54:08] <deepy> won't that give a larger moment of it being visible?
[02:54:16] <Cork> uh, no
[02:54:38] <Cork> $(function() { $('all sections you want to animate').hide() })
[02:54:51] <Cork> and then you just do $(target).slideToggle();
[02:54:58] <deepy> ohshi-
[02:54:59] <Cork> for the sections you want to toggle
[02:55:09] <deepy> .pretty-table td { display: none;
[02:55:26] <Cork> deepy: doing it in js means if js is off the text is still readable
[02:55:40] <Cork> deepy: you should try to make your pages progressive if possible
[02:55:41] <deepy> This site is 100% reliant on JS being available
[02:55:53] <AdamPDotty> too high
[02:55:57] <Cork> that's bad design
[02:56:30] <deepy> it might be yes, but in this case it's somewhat working
[02:56:34] <Cork> deepy: also the slide/fade/similar depends on jquery knowing what display type the element should have when it's visible
[02:56:41] <Cork> and it gets that from .hide()
[02:56:59] <Cork> deepy: except you get's the bugs from doing it the wrong way
[02:57:15] <deepy> The page is essentially a glorified tail -f
[02:58:26] <amaroks> Gazpacho: Thanks a million
[02:58:51] <deepy> is the bugs from doing it wrong meant to be about the JS part?
[02:59:31] <Cork> deepy: hmm, lets backtrack a little bit
[02:59:47] <Cork> setting display:none in the css can cause animation to not work
[03:00:02] <Cork> cause jquery will assume that the element is of type display: block;
[03:00:06] <deepy> Oh I'm not using that, I'm actually listening to you even if I look arrogant
[03:00:18] <Cork> deepy: if the toggle doesn't happen at all, then it's something else
[03:00:39] <deepy> Well finding the CSS issue solved this :P
[03:00:39] <lejocelyn> why would an ajax function returns me the all webpage in the response field, while looking at Firebug's POST data information?
[03:00:44] <deepy> Thanks for the help :-)
[03:01:34] <Cork> lejocelyn: what does post data have to do with respons field?
[03:02:29] <lejocelyn> Cork: sorry, I wasn't clear enough, the answer you get from an ajax request
[03:02:53] <Cork> lejocelyn: still don't follow
[03:03:07] <lejocelyn> when you post an ajax request, you get a reply
[03:03:09] <lejocelyn> no ?
[03:03:22] <Cork> you mean you see something like json in firebug but html in ajax success?
[03:03:39] <Cork> lejocelyn: sure
[03:04:40] <lejocelyn> in that answer, I get the whole current webpage instead of the answer I'd like to have from my php script
[03:04:57] <lejocelyn> even though, at the moement, it shoould be an error
[03:05:03] <Cork> lejocelyn: well you're php is generating a full page
[03:06:23] <lejocelyn> :D that's it actually
[03:06:40] <lejocelyn> I just didn't get why the application was doing it
[03:08:02] <lejocelyn> is there people here having experience with elasticsearch ? I'm looking for good readings/books/tutorials about using it with jquery
[03:08:07] <okdamn1> hey sorry, which is the keycode for shift and for enter keys?

[03:17:07] <Tsd_> i didn't find the correct css style
[03:17:22] <Cork> okdamn1: its built into the browser after all :)

[05:48:29] <hpekdemir> but when I load other tabs I don't get any ajax response from the second ajax post.
[05:49:27] <hpekdemir> is this related to some caching of the browser? in console I can see how the second ajax is posting

[06:25:41] <inad922> hello
[06:25:57] <inad922> If I have a jquery object how can I get a copy of the contained element as a string?
[06:26:53] <deepy> innerHTML?
[06:27:38] <inad922> deepy: nah I want the element itself as a string so something shorter than el.parent().html()
[06:29:30] <deepy> Can you use outerHTML?
[06:30:29] <deepy> [0].outerHTML
[06:30:49] <tubbo> damn. when was event.srcElement valid syntax?
[06:30:59] <tubbo> just encountered a bug due to the use of that instead of event.currentTarget
[06:37:50] <inad922> deepy: good idea, thanks
[06:38:20] <inad922> also how do I insert a previously nonexisting element(I have this as text) after an existing element
[06:40:00] <shoky> .after() or .insertAfter()
[06:46:16] <sunbeam> seutje: doesn't work
[06:46:30] <seutje> kewl
[06:47:02] <sunbeam> hehe
[06:50:47] <PeterB> Hi, I'm trying to write a plugin using jQuery boilerplate - my code worked until I converted it. Can you help please? http://jsfiddle.net/5VPPB/
[06:55:20] <deepy> inad922: would .append() work?
[06:55:49] <inad922> deepy: aw yea in the meantime I used after(). Was using insertAfter but that's not really what I wanted
[06:56:20] <deepy> Do you have a set of elements?
[06:56:33] <inad922> deepy: nah just a string which is one element
[06:56:57] <xec> do you have a string or an element?
[06:57:21] <deepy> Oh, .after() is on the outside while .append() is on the inside
[07:02:51] <MickRip> PeterB: I think $(this) should be something to do with your element in your click event
[07:03:05] <MickRip> PeterB: in the constructor, this.element is used, and I think that's important
[07:13:23] <Tixz> I want to write an alternative .serialize() for forms. Is $('form').bind('mySerialise', function(){}); the right way to do this or is there a better way to bind a method only to form elements?

[07:45:48] <adman65> hey guys
[07:45:56] <adman65> anyone know what's wrong with this pre filter snippet? http://pastebin.com/N4taKhnF
[07:46:13] <adman65> the "fooBar" param isn't being sent as fooBar but as [object Object]
[07:48:29] <dcherman> adman65: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L434-L439 - looks like data conversion happens prior to applying prefilters.  if you want to do what you're doing, you'll probably have to serialize it yourself.
[07:53:33] <pachet> boytoy: howdy
[07:54:31] <adman65> dcherman: : thanks man1
[08:04:06] <kotyy> Hey guys, I'm having some trouble with a simple snippet.
[08:04:22] <kotyy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5bf2adc54ed18c5b60d2
[08:04:51] <kotyy> This works fine in desktop browsers, but not on iOS
[08:05:14] <kotyy> I suspect that touchstart may not be firing?
[08:05:29] <kotyy> But the issue is that the class is never removed on iOS.
[08:08:39] <kotyy> or perhaps the handler isn't being set up at the right time?
[08:13:14] <thang> kotyy: the last one, youre adding the event handler every time youre clicking the navmenu
[08:13:52] <BLeg> I'm using the .on('focusout') event to determine when a form loses focus (so I can perform an animation). The problem I'm having is that the focusout event is triggered even when the form's child elements are clicked. I've tried the .on('blur') handler with no success. I have a jsfiddle that illustrates the problem, found here: http://jsfiddle.net/yZDeU/
[08:14:23] <jedimind> them's a lot of handlers
[08:14:49] <kotyy> the model I'm going for is "add class when clicked, then the next click anywhere other than the menu should remove the class." Thoughts on how I SHOULD be doing this?
[08:15:15] <jedimind> same basic principle, but maybe you should use .one
[08:15:25] <jedimind> which will destroy that event after the first time it happens
[08:15:28] <jedimind> instead of constantly adding to it
[08:15:52] <jedimind> the other option is to constantly have one singular event bonded to document/body and make sure it doesn't bubble up to your menu interaction
[08:15:53] <kotyy> I am using jQuery's one method, no?
[08:16:01] <jedimind> i don't know, i didn't look at your code
[08:16:03] <jedimind> :)
[08:16:06] <kotyy> oh, okay :)
[08:16:39] <kotyy> Yeah, the thing that's confusing me is that it works fine on the desktop, but on iOS, I don't get the expected behavior.
[08:17:47] <_mak> var result_block = $(".result-block").clone();    how can I modify the tag <p> that is inside the var result_block?
[08:18:53] <jedimind> kotyy, I've always used something like this...
[08:18:57] <jop008> I have a page with links using <a href=
[08:19:22] <jop008> when I lauch on this page everything is not there the querystring is empy
[08:19:28] <jop008> when I do a refresh
[08:19:32] <jedimind> kotyy,  http://jsfiddle.net/Gzxds/
[08:19:33] <jop008> everything is fine
[08:19:38] <BLeg> _mak have you tried result_block.find('p'); ?
[08:20:02] <jedimind> that basically always removes the class active from $scope (in this case nav with id #primary)
[08:20:10] <jedimind> unless you click inside the nav#primary , then it won't remove it
[08:20:24] <jop008> how do you handle page transitions?
[08:20:32] <jop008> newbie
[08:21:27] <_mak> BLeg, tks!
[08:21:40] <BLeg> _mak: no problem
[08:21:49] <boulet101010> Hi, i experience a very strange problem since this morning. When I get the AJAX response, it is prefixed by an invisible space that makes JSON.parse impossible to run. Also, when I trim the reponse, no problem at all to parse the JSON. Somebody already experienced this? (jquery 1.8.3)
[08:22:12] <boulet101010> also, the invisble space isn't present when the string is echoed.
[08:23:56] <jedimind> jop008, was that for me ?
[08:24:35] <jop008> found I can use data-ajax=false
[08:24:45] <kotyy> jedimind: that's pretty neat. looks quite a bit more bulletproof that what I have.
[08:25:16] <jop008> I am depending on querystring for interpage communication
[08:28:00] <opalepatrick> I want to use json to update quantity and specification fields for a dynamically generated series of product rows with ids. Any resources or pointers appreciated?
[08:28:35] <noway421> Hi guys, jquery plans to completely abandon php (including tests) and go on node.js?
[08:28:54] <boulet101010> opalepatrick, where are stored the products?
[08:30:41] <opalepatrick> in a database, boulet101010 - I have less problem with the json part and more with identifying the elements that need to be updated. THat is why lookingat an example would be good, but so much out there seems dated?
[08:30:43] <PerlWebDev> noway421: and that means what? since jquery isn't run from the server, so doesn't care about the server side language used to generate the pages
[08:33:28] <boulet101010> opalepatrick, give an example
[08:34:20] <kotyy> I read on SO that on iOS touch events do not bubble to document. can anyone confirm that?
[08:34:20] <opalepatrick> boulet101010, I will thanks
[08:35:12] <boulet101010> i only have 30 min
[08:35:33] <_mak> BLeg, the problem with find() is that it will return me only the element that I'm searching for... what I need is to clone an element, change some html and insert it in the document again...(hint: I'm creating a list of elements from a default div block)
[08:35:42] <PeterBooker> Hi guys, I am adding a link to the top right corner of an image, by wrapping the image in a container (span), then positioning the link with css, is there a better way I could position the link using jquery, without needing the container?
[08:37:15] <BLeg> _mak: I'll type you a a basic fiddle, hold on
[08:38:11] <_mak> BLeg, oh, how nice... ok
[08:38:57] <micthev> http://jsbin.com/ufamaf/17/ how can I Drop A B C D E in red dashed and after Item 1,2,3,4,5 in A,B,C,D,E and clone the ul/li before ?
[08:41:45] <jo_> Hi all.  Quick question: I'm having trouble specifying a selector context.  When I do `$('#foo', '<div id="foo">blah</div>')`, I get back [].  I have a workaround with x.filter().add(x.find()), but that's really gross looking.  Is there any way to run the selector on an HTML string?
[08:42:18] <jop008> How can you make a click funtion in listview when user clicks on the arrow?
[08:42:51] <BillCriswell> jo_: Wrap your second parameter in $()?
[08:43:02] <jo_> Thanks Bill.  Tried to no avail.
[08:43:04] <jop008> Explan a bit more
[08:43:07] <BLeg> Here _mak: http://jsfiddle.net/Urhme/
[08:43:52] <BillCriswell> jo_: Hm.
[08:44:55] <_mak> BLeg, ah ok! thanks again!
[08:44:56] <BillCriswell> jo_: $('#foo', $('<div><div id="foo">blah</div></div>')); This works, guess it's cause it's deeper.
[08:45:09] <BLeg> _mak: If you're just changing stuff you can just straight up change stuff
[08:45:09] <jo_> Ah.
[08:45:18] <BLeg> _mak: You don't need to clone the element
[08:45:51] <BLeg> _mak: i.e: you can just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Urhme/1/
[08:45:55] <_mak> BLeg, but I'm doing it in a list...and I have a 'model' block to clone from, then I insert the data and add it
[08:46:11] <jo_> Thanks, Bill.  I guess the default $() selector runs filter (or find?) and only operates on the topmost level, which probably normally isn't a problem because of the <html> and/or <body> tags.
[08:46:11] <_mak> BLeg, got it
[08:46:24] <BLeg> _mak: Okay well, you know your requirements better than I do so, HTH
[08:46:28] <BillCriswell> jo_: Truth.
[08:46:58] <jo_> Okay.  Thanks a bunch.  I suppose I'll stick to the workaround for the time being.  Thanks very much for your help.
[08:47:00] <BillCriswell> I believe it's more  find. Can't see $('#foo', '#foo'); working.
[08:47:03] <BillCriswell> Hahha, foo foo.
[08:47:03] <_mak> BLeg, it does.. tks!
[08:47:12] <BillCriswell> No problem at all jo_.
[08:47:37] <BLeg> I'm using the .on('focusout') event to determine when a form loses focus (so I can perform an animation). The problem I'm having is that the focusout event is triggered even when the form's child elements are clicked. I've tried the .on('blur') handler with no success. I have a jsfiddle that illustrates the problem, found here: http://jsfiddle.net/yZDeU/
[08:47:39] <jo_> It's one or the other.  I can never remember if find searches at the root level or if filter does.
[08:48:06] <jo_> We need one that goes all the way through the tree.  Like a select function or something.  :P
[08:48:14] <jo_> Thanks again.
[08:48:17] <BLeg> I've found a solution here: http://jsfiddle.net/SO_AMK/GNfzw/. But it looks like it's duplicating stuff and there surely must be a better way.
[08:48:18] <BillCriswell> jo_: No problem
[08:52:11] <jop008> How can you make the selector clickable in a listview?
[08:53:13] <jo_> jop008, $(selector).click(callback)?
[08:54:43] <BillCriswell> jop008: Not too sure what you mean by listview?
[08:55:41] <boulet101010> there is a whitespace in front of the response for the ajax call
[08:55:51] <boulet101010> jquery 1.9.1
[08:56:09] <boulet101010> somebody already experienced this?
[08:56:12] <jop008> a list with items
[08:56:16] <Z3R0> what's going on ?
[08:56:25] <jop008> with a right > arrow at the right
[08:56:37] <jop008> Like you see on many mobile devices
[08:56:41] <jop008> in interfaces
[08:57:09] <jop008> So I can make use of this  $(selector).click(callback)?
[08:57:38] <BillCriswell> jop008: Yeah, just need to replace selector with the path to the elements you want the even listener on.
[08:57:46] <BillCriswell> event*
[08:58:01] <Z3R0> lol good ole' BillCriswell
[08:58:57] <amph1bius> Bill is awesome :)
[08:59:32] <BillCriswell> I just answer the easy ones ( and occasionally try the harder ones and I get luck sometimes ) !
[09:00:08] <amph1bius> heh
[09:00:24] <amph1bius> eventually it'll be that you just answer the hard ones, and not the easy ones :)
[09:02:00] <BillCriswell> I just want to be good at explaining things. I really appreciate when people can do it so I try to as well.
[09:05:02] <pachet> amph1bius: so true; the hard ones drain you and leave you stranded in a desert with nothing but a collector's edition copy of the `my fair lady` soundtrack
[09:06:11] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Are you sure you don't want "blur"?
[09:07:28] <BLeg> BillCriswell: I can't seem to get the blue event to fire
[09:07:34] <BLeg> ....... blur
[09:08:26] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Are you basically trying to do like... if an input is focused that's not in a form hide another form?
[09:08:42] <BillCriswell> Well, animate, not hide.
[09:11:09] <ladislaw> how do I print out the name of this attribute? $div
[09:11:47] <ladislaw> that would be val()
[09:11:49] <ladislaw> nvm
[09:11:57] <BLeg> BillCriswell: No. I've edited my fiddle slightly. http://jsfiddle.net/yZDeU/1/
[09:12:28] <BillCriswell> ladislaw: That would print out the value of an input. What attribute do you need from $div? I'm assuming the value attribute now...
[09:13:40] <ladislaw> I have I have an element assigned to this var e.g $div = $('.foo');
[09:13:45] <ladislaw> i'd like to print out foo
[09:14:01] <Z3R0> well foo is just a class
[09:14:02] <BillCriswell> You want the class attributes value?
[09:14:13] <Z3R0> in reality, you won't be able to JUST get foo, unless you're searching for foo
[09:14:15] <ladislaw> yes
[09:14:18] <Z3R0> you will get all classes
[09:14:30] <BLeg> BillCriswell: What I'm trying to do is have it so that you can click a button to bring up a search bar, and when the search bar loses focus, the bar hides itself. But when I click the button to go ahead with my search, it hides the bar!
[09:14:32] <ladislaw> print out the value 'foo'
[09:14:53] <ladislaw> ok how will search for for?
[09:14:56] <ladislaw> nvm
[09:14:59] <BillCriswell> $div.attr('class') will return that.
[09:15:04] <ladislaw> ok
[09:15:21] <Z3R0> erm
[09:15:25] <Z3R0> assuming there is ONLY 1 class
[09:15:33] <Z3R0> class="foo bar" will show both ;)
[09:15:45] <BillCriswell> $div.attr('class').split(' ')[0] =)
[09:15:53] <Z3R0> assuming foo is the first entry in the class lol
[09:16:18] <BillCriswell> I guess the better thing to do here is find out WHY he needs that.
[09:16:23] <Z3R0> roflcopter :)
[09:16:31] <Z3R0> yea that is a big question I guess
[09:16:40] <BillCriswell> ladislaw: Why do you need that?
[09:16:41] <Z3R0> why DO you need 'foo' if you're binding to .foo ?
[09:16:58] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Hmmm.
[09:17:30] <ladislaw> one of th e statement is misbehavingÖchecking if the fault is with the variables
[09:17:57] <noway421> PerlWebDev: to runing jquery tests still needed php server
[09:18:03] <BillCriswell> BLeg: If that button is submitting the form and it's not ajax you'll never really notice if it hides when it loses focus.
[09:18:14] <ladislaw> $div.attr('.foo) <= i'm getting undefined =.
[09:18:24] <BillCriswell> You can hide it when the form is submitted instead of when the query field loses it's focus.
[09:18:36] <BillCriswell> ladislaw: That's because you don't have a .foo attribute.
[09:18:45] <ladislaw> i guess my hunch was crrect
[09:18:51] <BLeg> BillCriswell: Oh I'm not worried about it hiding after the form is submitting. It's hiding before the form is submitting, that's the problem. It's like the 'focusout' event is fired before anything.
[09:19:14] <BLeg> BillCriswell: I don't care if the button is gone as the page changes
[09:20:08] <BillCriswell> Have you seen this pattern in the wild somewhere? Having a hard time following.
[09:20:37] <BLeg> BillCriswell: Can I PM you? I'll just show you
[09:20:45] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Sure.
[09:30:09] <hemangpatel> Hello
[09:30:25] <hemangpatel> Has anyone used catautocomplete ?
[09:31:42] <hemangpatel> I want custom html in autocomplete with category
[09:33:04] <hemangpatel> anyone ?
[09:41:45] <Elvanor> Is someone familiar with AMD ? The define() function ?
[09:42:28] <Tixz> Can $(this).siblings('.error').remove() be made into $(this).remove(selector) somehow, and what should the selector be? I'm thinking something akin to ' ~¬†.error'
[09:42:39] <Tixz> Elvanor: Yeah, what's your question?
[09:43:31] <Tixz> hemangpatel: Look into Chosen, I think that might be what your looking for. Otherwise Select2
[09:44:08] <hemangpatel> Tixz: can you explain more ? I don't understand .
[09:44:19] <Elvanor> Tixz: I am using the standalone version of Sizzle
[09:44:30] <Elvanor> and I wont load on a page where define() exists
[09:44:31] <Tixz> hemangpatel: Look into it yourself, there's plenty of docs on their respective websites
[09:44:44] <Elvanor> This comes down to the line  if ( typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
[09:44:48] <Elvanor> (Sizzle code)
[09:45:03] <Elvanor> if this is true, Sizzle executes: define(function() { return Sizzle; });
[09:45:14] <Elvanor> instead of just window.Sizzle = Sizzle
[09:45:21] <Elvanor> but in this case, it does not work
[09:45:27] <Elvanor> Sizzle is not defined on the apge
[09:46:02] <Tixz> It's because when you have use the define function to define an amd module, you take all loaded scripts as parameters
[09:46:07] <Tixz> Let me find an example
[09:46:58] <Tixz> require(["libs/sizzle"], function(Sizzle) { /*whatever you want to do with Sizzle*/ })
[09:47:11] <PeterBooker> Can I fetch the current webpage URL via jQuery?
[09:47:32] <Tixz> PeterBooker: window.location.href
[09:47:40] <PeterBooker> I love you!
[09:47:48] <Tixz> PeterBooker: No need for jQuery, just vanilla JS
[09:48:14] <PeterBooker> I was using window.location.hostname;
[09:48:20] <PeterBooker> thank you very much Tixz!
[09:49:43] <Tixz> Elvanor: If you're defining an AMD module yourself, then it's almost the same (given you use require.js): define(["libs/sizzle"], function(Sizzle) {});
[09:50:19] <Elvanor> Tixz: I dont get it
[09:50:49] <Tixz> Alright, how are you loading Sizzle? Are you using an AMD loader or similar?
[09:51:23] <Elvanor> Tixz: not sure. The script containing Sizzle is probably loaded via require() yes
[09:51:47] <Tixz> But how are YOU doing it? <script src="..."> ?
[09:52:21] <Elvanor> require(["//static.kameleoon.com/css/customers/r9u0567aww/0/kameleoon.js"],function(){Kameleoon.loadSiteProfile("r9u0567aww")});
[09:52:32] <Elvanor> Tixz: this is how it is done
[09:52:38] <Elvanor> and the kameleoon.js script contains Sizzle
[09:52:50] <Tixz> What's inside kameleoon.js?
[09:53:02] <Elvanor> There is a Kameleoon object, then the Sizzle code
[09:53:14] <Tixz> kameleoon has to be defined as an AMD module if you want to load it like that and incorporate sizzle
[09:54:03] <Elvanor> Tixz: hmm, I see
[09:54:17] <Elvanor> I probably just remove the amd line concerning Sizzle
[09:54:28] <Tixz> No no, never edit your lib
[09:54:34] <Tixz> that'll only cause you trouble :)
[09:54:38] <Tixz> Here's what you do:
[09:55:09] <Tixz> define(['path/to/sizzle'], function(Sizzle){ /* kameleoon.js code */ });
[09:55:22] <Tixz> and then replace references to window.Sizzle with Sizzle
[09:55:28] <Tixz> it should be that easy
[09:56:21] <Elvanor> Tixz: where do I write define(['path/to/sizzle'], function(Sizzle){ /* kameleoon.js code */ }); ?
[09:56:54] <Tixz> In your kameleoon file. You put all your code where I put the comment
[09:57:41] <Elvanor> I think I understand, but it would be complex and would really require me to understand how this all works. I'll just disable it for now.
[09:57:58] <Tixz> ALright, but you might as well not use require.js then
[09:58:06] <Tixz> I mean, there's no point in using it
[09:58:22] <Elvanor> Of course. I am not actually using it, the customer is :-)
[09:58:46] <Tixz> It's not that complex anyhow
[09:58:52] <Tixz> anyway, do as you wish
[09:59:01] <Tixz> I'll mail you the bill x)
[09:59:43] <Elvanor> Tixz: no problem, I will forward that to the customer :-)
[10:02:16] <Tomashe> ehy guys i have on select box with options <option p="1" value="99">Price per month: 99$</option> and i do $(".ORDERSEL").on("change",function(){ var ordersel = $(this).attr("p");  alert(ordersel);
[10:02:22] <Tomashe> ia always get undefined
[10:02:24] <Tomashe> any ideas
[10:04:48] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: The p attribute isn't on the select. It's on the option. You need the option that was chosen.
[10:05:12] <Tixz> Tomashe: Pretty sure you want that p to be a data-p attribute too
[10:07:36] <Tomashe> how do i check the option that been selected
[10:07:37] <Tomashe> ?
[10:08:11] <pachet> !mdn selectedIndex @ Tomashe
[10:08:12] <b-ot> Tomashe: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüdeveloper.mozilla.org selectedIndex @ Tomashe‚Äù.
[10:08:27] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: There's a option:selected selector.
[10:09:35] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: http://jsbin.com/ineyid/1/edit

[10:21:19] <towlie> i created a basic html form and am trying to use the jquery form plugin but im getting an error "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'ajaxForm' " this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Eu5vp/1/
[10:21:52] <towlie> I verified that the javascript file for the jquery form.js does get included

[10:28:13] <CaporalDead_> hi folks !
[10:28:19] <Z3R0> heya CaporalDead_
[10:28:44] <CaporalDead_> I'm getting some trouble while disabling a select with jQuery oO
[10:29:21] <jop008> If I have multiple list boxes on my page how can I use  $(selector).click(callback)
[10:29:33] <CaporalDead_> Here is ma y code http://pastebin.com/S7M9qDZZ
[10:29:39] <jop008> I want to act on the > click
[10:30:02] <jop008> the triangle button at the right of the list item
[10:30:04] <CaporalDead_> it doesn't work and didn't find out why, many posts on stackoverflow spoke about it but no answers
[10:31:30] <CaporalDead_> the code I gave is executed when the page is loaded
[10:32:01] <CaporalDead_> It works for the css part but not for the disabled
[10:32:37] <sacho> CaporalDead_, the disabled property has a boolean type, not a string.
[10:32:56] <Z3R0> why are you adding disabled right after removing it ?
[10:33:15] <CaporalDead_> I tried "true" too
[10:33:42] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/usw7c/ <-- it's very disabled.
[10:33:50] <sacho> perhaps things are not what they seem to you.
[10:34:11] <Swapnesh> can someone plz help me with this jQuery issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16146546/jquery-email-validation-and-recaptcha-is-not-working-in-a-two-stage-form-submiss
[10:34:46] <ladislaw> 'speed is not a function? $body.animate(bodyAni, 100);
[10:34:56] <CaporalDead_> if i execute $('#MySelect').attr('disabled', true); with the debug console in chrome
[10:34:58] <CaporalDead_> it works
[10:35:26] <Z3R0> CaporalDead_ what are you trying to do exactly ?
[10:35:34] <CaporalDead_> but my code is in a function that is call @ load
[10:35:37] <Swapnesh> I really stuck with the jQuery validation issue
[10:35:44] <CaporalDead_> trying to disabled all my inputs ^^
[10:35:56] <CaporalDead_> text inputs, selects and textareas
[10:36:22] <Z3R0> on what? form load?
[10:36:54] <CaporalDead_> page load
[10:37:19] <sacho> please create a test case demonstrating the problem
[10:37:32] <Z3R0> ur .each if wrong
[10:37:39] <Z3R0> .each function() uses a callback to the item
[10:37:44] <Z3R0> function(item) {
[10:38:35] <jop008> How can I find the > element on a list item
[10:38:41] <jop008> to fire an event on
[10:39:25] <Z3R0> CaporalDead_ http://jsfiddle.net/FfQWZ/
[10:39:42] <sacho> $(item).find('>element')
[10:39:46] <Z3R0> :selected ?
[10:40:44] <CaporalDead_> doesn't work @Z3R0
[10:41:17] <sacho> what "doesn't work"?
[10:41:26] <CaporalDead_> it's not disabled
[10:41:31] <Swapnesh> how do i handle jQuery validate method on button click instead on submit
[10:41:56] <CaporalDead_> again, if I use the debug console and execute >> $('#MySelect').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[10:41:58] <CaporalDead_> it works
[10:42:07] <CaporalDead_> but my code is executed @ page load
[10:42:24] <CaporalDead_> all inputs except selects are disabled
[10:44:11] <sacho> How come it's disabled in the fiddle, then?
[10:45:02] <Z3R0> so is that one...
[10:45:34] <Z3R0> what's not disabled?
[10:45:40] <Z3R0> everythign in that fiddle is disabled on lod
[10:46:09] <Z3R0> $(document).ready(function() { // fiddle execute on page load too....
[10:46:27] <jop008>   $("#listclient").click (function(e) {
[10:46:28] <jop008>   });
[10:46:47] <jop008> how can I detect the right mouse click?

[10:47:30] <WarDekar> has anyone here used tablesorter? I'm having issues getting the Pager to work
[10:47:44] <Z3R0> WarDekar I used to... but I moved on to using DataTables() ;)
[10:47:56] <Z3R0> never could get ts to work properly
[10:47:56] <WarDekar> did you ever get Pager working properly?
[10:48:12] <WarDekar> blerg, dunno why it doesn't work i'm following the example exactly
[10:48:23] <WarDekar> pager shows below the table but it still shows the entire table
[10:48:51] <Z3R0> bummer :(
[10:49:34] <intergalactic> anyone going to conf in portland
[10:49:48] <WarDekar> it makes the table un-sortable too so there's clearly something going on but can't figure out what it is
[10:49:54] <Z3R0> show code?
[10:49:57] <Z3R0> fiddle it up ?
[10:50:09] <WarDekar> all i really want is a multi-select box
[10:50:13] <WarDekar> with the ability to show columned data
[10:50:18] <WarDekar> i don't even need to be able to sort it
[10:50:31] <WarDekar> but this seemed like the easiest way to do it, but now it's turning into pissing me off
[10:53:38] <WarDekar> is there any way to just put tabs into a select box?
[10:53:57] <WarDekar> like, tab-key
[10:59:02] <Swapnesh> Need JQuery help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16146546/jquery-email-validation-and-recaptcha-is-not-working-in-a-two-stage-form-submiss
[10:59:57] <Swapnesh> Someone please guide me with the process how can i make it working ?
[11:02:22] <BillCriswell> Swapnesh: Don't run validation on click of the submit button, run it on the submission of the form.
[11:06:06] <Swapnesh> @BillCriswell Actually I am trying to show captcha on second stage..only if user enters correct email id..so this is not going to be possible like this way ?
[11:13:22] <dareign85> $('body').on('contextmenu', "#chat_message_"+(messages[i].message_id), function() {} << why inside the function $(this).text() works...but $(this).id is undefined?
[11:14:58] <sa[]nt> .id isn't defined in a jquery object
[11:15:00] <BillCriswell> dareign85: Cause jQuery doesn't have an id property.
[11:15:10] <dareign85> so how do i get the id?
[11:15:16] <BillCriswell> dareign85: this.id will work, $(this).attr('id') would be the "jquery" way.
[11:15:21] <dareign85> ah
[11:15:35] <BillCriswell> Swapnesh: Ah sorry, Zoned.
[11:15:51] <Swapnesh> NP its all ok
[11:16:08] <zoned> haha
[11:16:19] <BillCriswell> zoned: Hahah.
[11:16:30] <faircliff> hey, im using the jqueryui autocomplete widget, could anyone direct me to where exactly i can modify the css of the searchbox itself, position and width?
[11:17:53] <BillCriswell> Swapnesh: Hmm...  Ok, so basically they enter an email, then click a button, then click another button, enter the captcha then click submit?
[11:18:54] <faircliff> no, its just the simple searchbox, so if they wanna search for a term on the site they type in the text box
[11:19:48] <Swapnesh> No..Only one input field and button1, If user enters correct email then button1 hides with email field disabled and lower the field recaptcha div opens up which contains fsubmit button
[11:20:01] <waxjar> is there a neat way to avoid nested callbacks when processing AJAX requests?
[11:22:02] <Swapnesh> If it is still not clear let me kno, I can then create an image to tell about the process :)
[11:23:05] <pachet> waxjar: use promises
[11:23:39] <pachet> ?deferred object
[11:23:58] <waxjar> oh wait, can i just return a value from .done(), req.done(function(x) { return x; }) for example?
[11:25:21] <pachet> $.when($.ajax({url:'foo'}), $.ajax({url:'/bar'}), $.ajax({url:'/baz'})).done(function ( foo, bar, baz ) { /* do stuff here */ });
[11:25:24] <pachet> waxjar^
[11:26:19] <waxjar> that's what i want to avoid. i need to make a new request with the data the first request returns
[11:26:50] <pachet> oh
[11:26:55] <dcherman> waxjar: see ?pipe
[11:27:03] <waxjar> ?pipe
[11:27:09] <Z3R0> ? ?pipe
[11:27:11] <dcherman> bah, damn bot.  just google for jquery pipe.
[11:27:12] <Z3R0> `?pipe
[11:27:18] <Z3R0> lol
[11:27:19] <shoky> `api pipe
[11:27:20] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[11:27:29] <waxjar> okay, thx dcherman
[11:27:29] <BillCriswell> Z3R0 can't find the pipe.
[11:28:32] <pachet> pipe is deprecated
[11:28:43] <shoky> sadly
[11:28:45] <pachet> ?deferred.then
[11:29:02] <dogarrhea> is there any jquery branded library that does modernizr.js?
[11:29:07] <pachet> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[11:29:19] <dogarrhea> or is modernizr.js a jquery branded library already?
[11:29:21] <BillCriswell> pachet: Thinking of the drive through from "Dude, where's my car?"
[11:29:25] <BillCriswell> .andThennnnnnnnn
[11:29:27] <pachet> lol
[11:29:32] <dogarrhea> ie, html5 version of jquery
[11:30:03] <dogarrhea> jquery mobile isn't really that kind of library, that's more like jqueryui for phones
[11:30:06] <BillCriswell> dogarrhea: Modernizr is probably the better way to go.
[11:32:39] <BillCriswell> Employee of the month this month I think guys.
[11:37:10] <motaka2> cythrawll: What I want to do is to whenever someone clicks a link or submits a form or any type of requesting url, I can pass it through a javascript/jquery function - like jquery mobile, is that possible ?
[11:37:15] <motaka2> What I want to do is to whenever someone clicks a link or submits a form or any type of requesting url, I can pass it through a javascript/jquery function - like jquery mobile, is that possible ?
[11:39:41] <BillCriswell> motaka2: $('a').on('click', function(){ e.preventDefault(); /* Figure out dem views */ });
[11:42:53] <anew> anyone know of a plugin where i can only allow 00-00-0000 be input in a form field ?
[11:43:06] <Z3R0> regex ?
[11:43:27] <anew> ble
[11:44:33] <NoiseEee> anew: sounds like the better approach is presenting a calendar that automatically puts that date-format into a specified field when chosen?
[11:44:45] <NoiseEee> anew: formatting like that is your app's problem, not your users problem.
[11:44:51] <BillCriswell> anew: Agreed with NoiseEee.
[11:44:58] <anew> actually yeah that is a better idea
[11:45:04] <Z3R0> agreed... typically what I would do, is strip it and format it on the backend ;)
[11:45:29] <Z3R0> just force them to use a certain number of characters, so you know they got the date right in a format you could read lol
[11:45:34] <Z3R0> MMDDYYYY
[11:45:47] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: If strtotime() can do something with it I'll try to figure it out haha
[11:45:47] <txdv> Hey, how do i do subsequent selects?
[11:46:09] <Z3R0> o.o it might be able to
[11:46:22] <Z3R0> but I assumed it would need a delimeter
[11:46:24] <txdv> $('div').$('a')
[11:46:28] <Z3R0> 4/8/13 or somethign
[11:46:33] <txdv> i specifically want to cast the second selector on an jquery object
[11:46:49] <Z3R0> $('div a'). ?
[11:46:57] <anew> z3r0 yeah i can force number of chars, but then i need the - in between them
[11:47:06] <Z3R0> anew you do that server side ;)
[11:47:18] <BillCriswell> txdv: You can do $('div').find('a')... I think that's what you want
[11:47:22] <BillCriswell> At least.
[11:47:22] <txdv> yeah
[11:47:23] <txdv> thanks
[11:47:31] <txdv> it was hard to google
[11:47:40] <txdv> i just forgot that freaking name
[11:47:43] <Z3R0> lol
[11:48:29] <anew> z3r0 yeah but what if they enter 99999999 instead of a real month/day/year
[11:49:03] <Z3R0> then you validate that with your server
[11:49:18] <Z3R0> if you're using php php if(checkdate(month, day, year))
[11:49:21] <Z3R0> invalid :)
[11:50:56] <Z3R0> that's how I validate my url's right now, because I have events/year/month/day/hour/minute/event_name lol ;)
[11:55:48] <anew> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ wait is this built into jq ?
[11:55:53] <anew> or is it a plugin i dont see the download
[11:56:08] <anew> ah it's jqui
[11:56:09] <anew> ok
[11:56:09] <Z3R0> yes
[11:56:11] <Z3R0> it's built in
[11:56:21] <anew> really?
[11:56:25] <Z3R0> er in jq-ui
[11:56:29] <anew> yeah
[11:56:29] <anew> ok
[11:56:35] <Z3R0> but I always load them both ;)
[11:57:34] <Swapnesh> Still No help for this post :( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16146546/jquery-email-validation-and-recaptcha-is-not-working-in-a-two-stage-form-submiss
[11:57:53] <Swapnesh> This is what i am trying http://i.imgur.com/7oIaF1e.png
[11:58:02] <Swapnesh> to do
[11:58:36] <Swapnesh> a two way process of email submission using jQuery validation
[12:11:50] <BillCriswell> Any of you guys use emmet?
[12:13:46] <anew> $( "#dp-normal" ).datepicker(); so i have this pretty simple code for datepicker, it works if there is one #dp-normal on the page, but not more than one?
[12:13:47] <anew> what do ?
[12:14:05] <BillCriswell> anew: Use a class.
[12:15:46] <anew> duh
[12:15:49] <anew> thx
[12:15:53] <BillCriswell> anew: No problem.
[12:57:08] <felipe_Brz> how can I detect in jquery when the server has sent a file (like a pdf file)?
[12:58:10] <felipe_Brz> or any file really. I have a form which, when submitted, makes the server output a pdf file, and I needed to be able to detect, in javascript, when that happens
[12:58:13] <felipe_Brz> is it possible?
[12:59:29] <NoiseEee> no
[12:59:46] <kotyy> I don't think that's possible. depending on what you want, this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3499597/javascript-jquery-to-download-file-via-post-with-json-data
[13:00:42] <jonjdub> callback?
[13:02:14] <felipe_Brz> ok i'll try that. thanks
[13:03:57] <Bloomberg> Guys hello!!
[13:04:07] <Bloomberg> If I have some like this ::  "<input type='text' value=''/>";
[13:04:22] <Bloomberg> How can I put a var inside of value=''
[13:06:42] <myosotis> jQuery('input[type=text]').attr('value', 'something');
[13:07:10] <NoiseEee> use .val()
[13:07:17] <NoiseEee> .val('whatever')
[13:11:53] <Bloomberg> I need to put some like this!!
[13:11:54] <Bloomberg> data = "<input type='text' value='\"value.proyinfo\"'/>";
[13:12:11] <Z3R0> wtf is value.proyinfo ?
[13:12:16] <Z3R0> is that a variable ?
[13:12:37] <Bloomberg> yes
[13:12:37] <NoiseEee> $('#someInput').val(value.proyinfo);
[13:12:38] <PerlWebDev> looks like the value he wants the input element to have
[13:13:01] <Bloomberg> yes
[13:13:05] <Z3R0> data = "<input type='text' value='"+value.proyinfo+"' />"; // although that's not relaly jquery l;o
[13:13:20] <Z3R0> if you give your input a class or id you can use what NoiseEee suggested
[13:13:24] <Z3R0> but as it sits right now, you don't have one
[13:14:52] <Bloomberg> Z3R0: Is that I'm doing a updating form, So I need to have the actual value for might change it and then update it!!
[13:20:50] <opalepatrick> http://jsfiddle.net/9SKsB/1/ - I know this is basic. The static rows shown are normally dynamically generated with a productid. What I need to do is identify the input boxes so that I can update them on the fly. prodid is ok for first line, thats it. Any help appreciated.
[13:21:16] <opalepatrick> atm not  got reall issues with the json bit
[13:23:41] <zeam> I am loading a modal that has a multiselect in it.  I call jQuery("#tags").multiselect().multiselectfilter(); when the page loads and there isn't a problem until I close the modal and click the link again, then I get TypeError: jQuery(...).multiselect is not a function
[13:24:01] <zeam> can someone point me in the right direction?
[13:24:52] <zeam> I am calling jQuery("#tags").multiselect().multiselectfilter(); when the modal loads too, otherwise the multiselct wouldn't display properly
[13:44:23] <GaryOak_> zeam: are you using a jquery plugin for the multiselect function?
[13:45:19] <dokma> how do I call a function if an id exists in the dom?
[13:45:33] <zeam> GaryOak_: yes
[13:45:57] <GaryOak_> zeam: which one?
[13:46:03] <zeam> http://www.erichynds.com/examples/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/demos/filter.htm
[13:49:47] <zeam> GaryOak_: any ideas?
[13:50:09] <GaryOak_> are you using the dialog widget in jquery-ui?
[13:50:46] <zeam> GaryOak_:  what do you mean?
[13:51:05] <GaryOak_> zeam: what are you using for the modal window?
[13:51:59] <zeam> GaryOak_: jui
[13:52:34] <GaryOak_> zeam: I'm just thinking you might wait until the modal window is loaded before it will initialize the windows contents
[13:52:55] <BillCriswell> dokma: $('id').someFunction() you mean?
[13:53:00] <zeam> but the first time the modal pops open it works fine
[13:53:03] <zeam> then I close it
[13:53:09] <zeam> click on the link again and it errors
[13:53:19] <dokma> BillCriswell: I mean test if #id exists and the call func()
[13:53:33] <dokma> like if($('#id')) func()
[13:53:42] <dokma> is that valid?
[13:53:54] <BillCriswell> dokma: You can do $('.foo').length
[13:54:07] <dokma> yes I just found that on stackoverflow
[13:54:13] <dokma> so that is good one?
[13:54:31] <BillCriswell> It might be useless to call that though depending on the plugin. If jQuery doesn't return any elements it just won't do anything.
[13:54:34] <zeam> GaryOak_: any other thoughts?
[13:54:39] <BillCriswell> dokma: Sure, it works.
[13:54:45] <zeam> I've been struggling all day with this
[13:54:54] <dokma> ok, thank you!
[13:55:01] <sacho> struggle struggle
[13:55:12] <zeam> sacho: :(
[13:55:40] <BillCriswell> dokma: Welcome!
[13:55:48] <dokma> :D
[13:55:49] <VCoolio> hi, trying the toggle function, can't get it to work: the item I want to click disappears on pageload, what am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5438446
[13:56:20] <GaryOak_> zeam: well once you close the dialog, it doesn't exist in the dom anymore, so you when you try to use the select you are calling it's functions before it actually exists in the dialog
[13:56:51] <zeam> but it never existed in the dom in the first place, I'm calling ajax to load the content of the div for the modal
[13:57:38] <GaryOak_> zeam: is your first .multiselect call within a $(document).ready call?
[13:58:04] <zeam> let me verify
[13:58:09] <joeloverton> VCoolio: it looks like you're trying to create a click handler that toggles another element, is that right?
[13:58:29] <VCoolio> joeloverton: yes, but the click handler doesn' t show
[13:58:38] <GaryOak_> zeam: just try tying the multiselect call to the dialog's open event
[13:58:48] <zeam> GaryOak_: no
[13:58:49] <joeloverton> toggle() doesn't create a click handler, it just toggles the visibility of the element you call it on
[13:59:11] <zeam> GaryOak_: it is called after the modal should pop open
[13:59:24] <ali1234> http://jsfiddle.net/efZN9/ can anyone explain to me why this works, specifically why it it still works even though the div gets removed?
[13:59:37] <opalepatrick> http://jsfiddle.net/9SKsB/7/ this gives me the values that I can use for the first row only as needed, how do I get values for multiple rows as required?
[13:59:59] <ali1234> actually... nevermind. derp
[14:00:13] <Z3R0> because it calls itself again ?
[14:00:15] <zeam> GaryOak_: thanks for the help...  I'll keep trying at it, have to get on a conf call...
[14:00:38] <ali1234> it's because the <g:plusone> is not inside the <div> at all
[14:00:45] <Z3R0> that too ;)
[14:01:14] <ali1234> i did wonder why the closing tag was red
[14:01:40] <Z3R0> lol
[14:02:36] <Z3R0> what is the reason behind hiding the div?
[14:02:43] <Z3R0> I put it in the div and it's still there
[14:02:54] <ali1234> it has a little "loading" thingy that gets removed when the button loads
[14:03:01] <ali1234> that's in the stylesheet though
[14:03:06] <Z3R0> ah
[14:03:31] <ali1234> hmm that's odd
[14:03:43] <ali1234> so why does it still work if you put it inside the div and then remove the div?
[14:04:58] <Z3R0> exactly
[14:04:59] <Z3R0> lol
[14:05:17] <Z3R0> ah
[14:05:20] <Z3R0> div = 278
[14:05:23] <Z3R0> you're removing 276
[14:05:27] <Z3R0> er 2676
[14:05:51] <Z3R0> div class="dd-google1-278"
[14:05:56] <Z3R0> $('.dd-google1-267').remove();
[14:06:10] <BillCriswell> VCoolio: http://jsbin.com/ojanuq/3/edit help with your situation?
[14:06:45] <ali1234> HA
[14:06:50] <ali1234> i fail at copy and paste
[14:07:18] <ali1234> ok, that works as expected now :)
[14:18:13] <matthewlebrun> anyone have any issues with .detach() in chromium embedded?
[14:18:22] <Gazpacho> no
[14:19:23] <BillCriswell> Never used .detach() =(
[14:20:01] <matthewlebrun> Gazpacho: have you used detach in CEF or just no experience with it?
[14:20:42] <GaryOak_> Looks like the main issue would be how it stores the contents you removed.
[14:21:24] <matthewlebrun> GaryOak_: actually the issue currently is that it doesn't remove the elements from the DOM
[14:21:43] <GaryOak_> matthewlebrun: well then that's a problem with remove
[14:22:06] <matthewlebrun> it works in Chrome/Firefox, but within an embedded frame it doesn't appear to be.
[14:22:35] <sam452> Hello,Hello, I want to swap images via a click function on a div's background-image but coming up blank. (".mydiv").click(function () { $(this).css("background-image", 'hi.png')}); Is this basic form right?
[14:23:22] <matthewlebrun> alright, thanks for the tip GaryOak_ just wanted to see if anyone here had run into anything similar, thanks
[14:25:19] <NoiseEee> sam452: yes, got the path correct?
[14:25:44] <BillCriswell> sam452: Don't forget the url() part.
[14:25:53] <BillCriswell> That shit gets me all the time.
[14:26:24] <sam452> I think so. Oh, that gives me a clue!
[14:26:29] <GaryOak_> yeah .css can be a little finicky sometimes
[14:26:57] <sam452> where would url() go? Around the path?
[14:27:05] <BillCriswell> sam452: $el.css('backgroundImage', 'url(img.jpg');
[14:27:27] <BillCriswell> I mixed up the ' and ).
[14:27:39] <BillCriswell> $el.css('backgroundImage', 'url(img.jpg)');
[14:27:41] <GaryOak_> BillCriswell: missed a ) after .jpg
[14:27:48] <GaryOak_> there you go
[14:28:06] <BillCriswell> You can tell it's getting close to 5.
[14:28:13] <GaryOak_> lol no joke
[14:31:14] <VCoolio> BillCriswell: hi, thanks for the link, that helped, but it works specifically for an #Id, I'd like it to work on the next div with class .Help, how to do that? something like $this.next('.Help).toggleClass('hidden')
[14:31:14] <sam452> Thx, BillCriswell: getting me closer.
[14:31:38] <BillCriswell> VCoolio: There you go.
[14:32:25] <BillCriswell> VCoolio: Just know .next() works with siblings, not children.
[14:36:24] <sam452> Rats, still fighting url is not defined:  $(this).css("backgroundImage", 'url(hi.png)')
[14:37:03] <BillCriswell> VCoolio: http://jsbin.com/elaged/1/edit here's a pretty bare bones example.
[14:37:10] <Jackboy> sam452 - Remember it's relative to where you are operating
[14:38:25] <joeloverton> sam is the code you just put in the channel exactly the same as what you're using? it sounds like you missed the quotes from around url(hi.png)
[14:39:02] <BillCriswell> They're not required ( maybe with funky image / part names? )
[14:39:09] <BillCriswell> a/part/path
[14:39:36] <Jackboy> it should be background-image anyway??
[14:39:39] <joeloverton> no, *around* url(hi.png) ‚Ä¶ 'url is not defined' sounds like he is calling url()
[14:39:52] <BillCriswell> Ah, truth.
[14:40:51] <sam452> Shortened for readability.
[14:41:15] <BillCriswell> sam452: http://jsbin.com/equmob/2/edit
[14:41:52] <VCoolio> BillCriswell: I _finally_ got it, the sibling thing killed me, I had the toggle thing right from the start
[14:41:55] <VCoolio> BillCriswell: thanks
[14:41:56] <sam452> Checking it now!
[14:42:07] <BillCriswell> VCoolio: No problem!
[14:43:05] <BillCriswell> sam452: url() is not a function. I can see what you'd think it not quote it now that joeloverton points it out. =(
[14:43:42] <Jackboy> Has anybody got much experience with Google Maps API btw?
[14:43:51] <Jackboy> I guess it's not a completely relevant question for this IRC...
[14:44:57] <BillCriswell> why you'd think to not quote it*
[14:45:12] <sam452> YES, it now works. Thx to BillCriswell: joeloverton: Jackboy:
[14:48:05] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: what's up?
[14:49:36] <Jackboy> GaryOak_: Trying to come up with a way to search Google Places API + Geocoding. Some addresses are found on the Places API, but not all, and the Places API doesn't have all the information. The only solution I've found is to go through Google Places API then, if there are zero results, go through Geocoding API.
[14:52:10] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: I think places is mainly for restaurants/services/business, so I'm not sure you should be using places unless you are looking for that type of information
[14:52:46] <Jackboy> GaryOak_: The problem is, I want to be able to support both. One input box 'Enter location', allowing the user to enter r/s/b or an actual address
[14:53:57] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: Then I think the way you are doing is probably how you have to do it
[14:54:40] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: there's not really a way to combine the two. Are the two api calls really slow or something?
[14:55:11] <archfool> How does one get a "collapsible" child of "collapsible-set" to scroll to visible if closing the previous element throws clicked element off-screen?
[14:56:07] <Jackboy> GaryOak_: Na it's just the request limit really. I'm caching some requests anyway, but I'm a tad annoyed because I've already recoded my booking model / google journey helper twice :(
[14:56:47] <rien> hey folks, I want to allow a selectbox to pass nil but then instead of saving nil to the DB, I want nil to mean "don't change what's in that column". how do I do that?
[14:59:03] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: the only thing I could find, if you haven't seen it already, was the [Geocomplete](https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete)
[15:00:52] <archfool> <div data-role="collapsible-set"><div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true" id="my1">...</div><div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true" id="my2">...</div></div>
[15:01:20] <archfool> If "my1" is open, and I expand "my2", the whole thing scrolls up, and I don't see the my2 base element.
[15:02:33] <Jackboy> GaryOak_: Only thing with that, it directs to the town rather than the actual business, still, it could be a useful resource so I've bookmarked it. Thanks for your help there buddy :D
[15:02:37] <archfool> UI intuition says that if I click/tap on an item, it stays on-screen.
[15:03:14] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: yeah np, google has slowly been closing off their apis and making it harder to use them without paying
[15:03:48] <Jackboy> GaryOak_ It's a shame really, it's a great resource
[15:05:01] <GaryOak_> Jackboy: Yeah, I can understand having limits on the API, but often times Google is the best resource.
[15:06:48] <sekyms> is splice destructive?
[15:07:02] <sekyms> if I do var test = foo.splice(0,7);
[15:07:07] <sekyms> does that change foo too?
[15:08:10] <sekyms> ajpiano: brilliant move by your jets
[15:08:15] <sacho> yes, it's destructive.
[15:09:25] <sekyms> that explains why this isn't working
[15:09:53] <sekyms> i should be using slice apparently
[15:10:42] <sekyms> thanks sacho
[15:12:39] <ericelliott> sekyms: var foo = [1, 2, 3]; var bar = foo.slice(0).splice(1,1); // bar = [2], foo = [1, 2, 3]
[15:12:51] <sekyms> wait
[15:13:07] <sekyms> oh you have oth
[15:13:09] <sekyms> both
[15:14:31] <ericelliott> sekyms: Yeah, slice(0) makes a shallow clone of foo, and splice extracts 2 from foo[]
[15:14:47] <sekyms> its weird that splice is like that
[15:15:06] <ericelliott> not really, because splice actually creates 2 result sets.
[15:15:13] <Kraytul> if I want to call a function with an object I have in a variable as the $(this) result for that function, how do I go about it?
[15:15:37] <Kraytul> I can't override the function arguments
[15:15:50] <archfool> am I missing an include if I get JS errors on .live() not a function?
[15:16:26] <sekyms> live is deprecated
[15:16:29] <sekyms> use .on
[15:16:33] <archfool> danke
[15:16:40] <sekyms> they took it out in 1.9
[15:17:44] <Kraytul> do I use proxy?
[15:17:51] <Z3R0> ?
[15:24:34] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help me with jquery and a bootstrap progress bar? http://jsfiddle.net/NcLCe/2/
[15:25:30] <Kraytul> what's your issue?
[15:25:57] <delboy1978uk> trying to delay 2 seconds, then get the bar to increase width and so on
[15:26:28] <GaryOak_> setTimeout isn't doing what you think it's doing
[15:26:40] <delboy1978uk> i know :-s
[15:26:52] <Kraytul> what about using setInterval()
[15:27:06] <Kraytul> and just doing that once, at the pagelevel...
[15:27:34] <delboy1978uk> basically my sites server only wants so many emails per minute so I'm trying to send a .post(), then when it returns move the bar along, wait 2 seconds, then start the next one
[15:27:45] <Kraytul> yeah
[15:28:04] <delboy1978uk> setInterval?
[15:28:07] * delboy1978uk googles
[15:30:07] <delboy1978uk> how do i tell js to just stop everything for 2 seconds?
[15:30:26] <Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1836105/how-to-wait-5-seconds-with-jquery
[15:30:34] <Z3R0> google is your friend
[15:32:41] <GaryOak_> timer and wait functions in most languages are a little weird
[15:32:46] <delboy1978uk> hmm I've tried setInterval, setTimeout, and .delay()
[15:32:51] <delboy1978uk> I'm seeing that lol
[15:33:16] <Zzaichik> @delboy1978uk Kraytul  http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/NcLCe/3/
[15:33:53] <Zzaichik> woops missing a semicolon
[15:35:39] <delboy1978uk> ok that delay works but it only does it once even when i put it .each() http://jsfiddle.net/NcLCe/4/
[15:39:56] <wookiehangover> so all of those setTimeouts are registered at the same time
[15:40:16] <wookiehangover> so it's like saying "wait for 2 seconds" a bunch of times all in a row
[15:40:28] <wookiehangover> they all "wait for 2 seconds" but not sequentially
[15:40:53] <wookiehangover> you really want a nested setTimeout or delay()
[15:41:19] <delboy1978uk> something like that :-P
[15:41:42] <delboy1978uk> look at this http://jsfiddle.net/NcLCe/4/
[15:46:43] <rebel_yell> Hey guys anyone have a code where on a button i could simulate the enter key
[15:46:59] <rebel_yell>           $("#add_tag").click(function(){   "press enter" });
[15:47:40] <PerlWebDev> I'd just use AutoIt and get it to click the button
[15:48:01] <rebel_yell> please explain
[15:48:17] <PerlWebDev> great way to automate repeated keyboard or mouse clicks on things
[15:48:27] <PerlWebDev> http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/
[15:48:58] <rebel_yell> there isnt a simpler way
[15:49:09] <rebel_yell> i just need it on that id
[15:49:11] <rebel_yell> thats all
[15:50:22] <thesisb> is there a cross-browser method of finding the width of a vertical scrollbar or the height of a horizontal scrollbar? Without needing an outer/inner div?
[15:50:47] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: $('#add_tag').trigger('keypress', function(){...})
[15:52:11] <GaryOak_> thesisb: I think scrollbars are set by the browser
[15:52:24] <thesisb> GaryOak_: they are
[15:52:54] <GaryOak_> thesisb: I don't think they change
[15:53:13] <thesisb> the dimensions of a scrollbar change from machine to machine/browser to browser
[15:53:27] <thesisb> I need to set a gap the width of the users scrollbar, so i need to find it out on pageload
[15:53:51] <rebel_yell> GaryOak_:  but it needs to be triggered on click
[15:54:23] <GaryOak_> that trigger part goes inside your click function
[15:55:15] <intergalactic> anyone know if there are any conference promo codes available
[15:55:19] <rebel_yell>         var e = jQuery.Event("keypress"); e.which = 13; //choose the one you want e.keyCode = 13; $("#add_t").click(function(){   $('#add_tag').trigger('keypress', function(){...}) });
[15:55:48] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832059/definitive-way-to-trigger-keypress-events-with-jquery
[15:56:44] <rebel_yell> trigger and click are the same thing?
[15:57:36] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: no, the click should trigger the keypress event
[15:58:48] <rebel_yell> var e = jQuery.Event("keypress"); e.keyCode = $.ui.keyCode.ENTER; $('#add_tag').click(function(){ $("input").trigger(e); });
[15:59:22] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: you need to tell trigger which key you want, like in the stackoverflow page, and then put that inside the click function for the add tag, my mistake it should be $(document).trigger not $('#add_tags').trigger
[16:05:03] <last1> is there a way to delay the execution of a for() loop ?
[16:05:10] <last1> aka, every iteration, pause 500ms
[16:06:56] <myhrlin> last1: looping through an object?
[16:06:57] <PerlWebDev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/951021/what-do-i-do-if-i-want-a-javascript-version-of-sleep
[16:10:05] <rebel_yell> var e = jQuery.Event("keypress"); e.keyCode = $.ui.keyCode.ENTER; $('#add_tag').click(function(){ $('.ui-autocomplete-input').focus(); $(document).trigger(e); });
[16:10:08] <rebel_yell> still not working
[16:11:31] <rebel_yell> GaryOak_: any suggestions?
[16:11:41] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: hmm
[16:12:03] <rebel_yell> it focuses on the field
[16:12:03] <rebel_yell> and should simulate pressign enter
[16:12:30] <joeloverton> that triggers an event as if enter was pressed
[16:12:32] <joeloverton> is that what you want
[16:12:50] <rebel_yell> joeloverton: yup
[16:13:03] <joeloverton> you probably want to trigger it on the input
[16:13:17] <joeloverton> since the handler you're trying to invoke is on the input, not the document
[16:13:59] <joeloverton> try using: $('.ui-autocomplete-input').focus().trigger(e);
[16:14:28] <rebel_yell> trying now
[16:15:21] <rebel_yell> nope didnt work
[16:15:27] <rebel_yell> am i getting the enter the correct way?
[16:15:46] <rebel_yell> it focuses
[16:15:51] <rebel_yell> but doesnt simulate enter
[16:15:55] <joeloverton> what are you actually trying to achieve by simulating enter?
[16:16:22] <rebel_yell> im using tag-it.js
[16:16:34] <rebel_yell> and a tag becomes a tag when a user presses enter
[16:17:04] <rebel_yell> else if (event.which == COMMA || event.which == ENTER )
[16:17:16] <rebel_yell> so im trying to simulate the event enter
[16:17:23] <rebel_yell> const ENTER			= 13;
[16:17:31] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: it may also be the e = jQuery.Event part, it should be var e = jQuery.Event("keydown", { keyCode: </your key> }); from the docs
[16:17:44] <joeloverton> the only event handler in tag-it.js is keydown
[16:17:53] <joeloverton> so try triggering keydown instead of keypress
[16:18:13] <joeloverton> (see line 222 of the unminified source)
[16:18:28] <rebel_yell> var e = jQuery.Event("keydown", { keyCode: ENTER });
[16:18:36] <joeloverton> i must go - good luck both.
[16:18:49] <rebel_yell> thanks man
[16:18:55] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: not quite
[16:19:04] <GaryOak_> keyCode: 13
[16:19:10] <GaryOak_> 13 is the enter key
[16:19:43] <rebel_yell> var e = jQuery.Event("keydown", { keyCode: 13 }); $('#add_tag').click(function(){ $('.ui-autocomplete-input').focus().trigger(e); });
[16:20:00] <rebel_yell> nothing happened
[16:20:02] <rebel_yell> still
[16:21:43] <rebel_yell> GaryOak_:  could it be that it just wont work becuase of the other javascript plugin
[16:22:24] <GaryOak_> if it's not returning a jquery object, maybe, but it would throw an error if that was the case
[16:22:58] <rebel_yell> gotcha
[16:23:00] <rebel_yell> yea no errors
[16:23:50] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: I'm writing a fiddle now
[16:24:28] <rebel_yell> kk thanks so much
[16:30:54] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: ok http://jsfiddle.net/mbxSn/1/
[16:31:49] <rebel_yell> thank you
[16:31:52] <rebel_yell> trying now
[16:32:07] <GaryOak_> yep, keypresses are a little tricky
[16:32:46] <GaryOak_> the keycode should show up in the console
[16:33:09] <rebel_yell> yup
[16:33:12] <rebel_yell> showing 13
[16:33:20] <delboy1978uk> this setTimeout stuff is busting my nut, the progress bar is working a lot nicer now but still not waiting properly http://jsfiddle.net/NcLCe/7/
[16:33:33] <rebel_yell> but still not acting as it
[16:33:41] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: cool
[16:33:50] <GaryOak_> oh no
[16:34:40] <rebel_yell> GaryOak_:  so confused
[16:34:48] <joker_89> hi
[16:34:49] <rebel_yell> it logs it in the console
[16:34:52] <rebel_yell> but doesnt work
[16:34:55] <rebel_yell> da fuck jquery
[16:35:05] <joker_89> is any website with typical example codes for reusing?
[16:36:02] <GaryOak_> rebel_yell: they aren't the same type of object unfortunately
[16:36:25] <rebel_yell> ugh
[16:36:29] <rebel_yell> its all good no worries
[16:36:38] <rebel_yell> im gonna try rewrite the actual plugin then
[16:36:54] <joker_89> is any webiste wit a repository of plugins?
[16:38:50] <coldhead> http://plugins.jquery.com/
[16:42:22] <joker_89> how can i have a menu divided into 3 columns, which is made by consulting my database on each clic and then referesh the right columns?
[16:46:15] <maahacka> joker_89: you attach an eventlistener to the click event
[16:46:37] <maahacka> you bind with a callback function that makes an AJAX call to the PHP
[16:47:07] <thesisb> joker_89: if its a menu it is used frequently and calls to backend are slow
[16:47:15] <thesisb> so store the data on the frontend on page load
[16:47:26] <maahacka> the PHP consults the database and returns a JSON result
[16:47:44] <joker_89> is there any example? searching "some words"
[16:47:45] <maahacka> and in another callback you parse the JSON result and repopulate the right column
[16:47:57] <thesisb> maahacka: where did he say php
[16:48:11] <maahacka> thesisb: i know him from #php
[16:48:13] <thesisb> k
[16:49:09] <thesisb> joker learn about ajax and json.  embed the menu as json in the js on page load and use that
[16:49:25] <thesisb> you dont need ajax for such things, and using it for meny navigation will be slow
[16:49:51] <joker_89> which alternatives i have?
[16:50:08] <maahacka> static data, as he said, stored in JSON format
[16:50:58] <thesisb> or just html format too, if it isnt very much

[16:52:38] <joker_89> if i use ajax is like a dependent select box yes?
[16:53:22] <joker_89> i think i am confusing ajax and jquery
[16:55:05] <maahacka> jquery is a framework for javascript
[16:55:25] <maahacka> ajax is a technology for asynchroneous (event-based) HTTP requests via JavaScript
[16:56:02] <joker_89> so is more used jquery
[16:56:27] <maahacka> jquery has built-in code for AJAX calls
[16:57:05] <joker_89> ok i go to read some tutorials about jquery
[16:57:10] <joker_89> and the usage in forms
[17:03:16] <Jayro> Hello, I am trying to use the jquery masonry plugin and am running intoa  strange error. I know this channel does not officially support it, but could anyone take a look for me? You can see it here http://dev.jr0d.com/logy . click 'call' a couple of time and you will see the error in the browser console. It simply can't find the method masonry() even though I followed the instructions here: http://masonry.desandro.com/docs/intro.html
[17:08:20] <GaryOak_> Jayro: you need to use a jquery selector to get the 'content' object so that you can call the masonry() function with it. $('#content').masonry(...);
[17:08:42] <Radar> How can I define a function that will take the same arguments as $.ajax, but manipulate the URL and add a query parameter on to the end of it before passing off to $.ajax?
[17:09:29] <Radar> I have a function that will do the manipulating (using jsuri), I just need to know how to extract the URL out of a typical $.ajax call, because as far as I know it can be done with either $.ajax('/blah') or $.ajax({ url: 'blah' })
[17:11:10] <GaryOak_> Radar: can't you just modify the URL before it goes to the ajax call, as a string?
[17:11:48] <Radar> GaryOak_: I want people to be able to call this function with the same arguments as $.ajax. It's kind of a proxy function to that method.
[17:11:58] <GaryOak_> ok
[17:11:59] <Radar> I need this parameter appended so that requests to the API are authenticated.
[17:13:58] <GaryOak_> Radar: function myAjax(url){ manipulateURL(url); $.ajax(url); } ?
[17:14:12] <Radar> GaryOak_: And what if people want to pass more than the url to the function?
[17:14:19] <Radar> $.ajax takes many, many options.
[17:14:42] <GaryOak_> Radar: have them send you an options object instead of a url
[17:14:58] <GaryOak_> just like with jquery plugins
[17:15:05] <GaryOak_> or the ajax call itself
[17:15:25] <Radar> alright then
[17:40:26] <coldhead> can i tell you that you are the purple in me
[17:41:03] <boytoy> no
[17:41:11] <boytoy> i prefer a darker shade
[17:54:26] <Jayro> Does anyone know how I can select an element on the page using an a unique ID i stored using $(element).data("internalID", "id");
[17:54:26] <Jayro> ?
[17:59:36] <sacho> why didn't you just give it an id?
[18:00:19] <stef123> i have a question, how would i be able to determine the most shared links on twitter, for example one method i was thinking was to get all trends and do a search for that trend returning all links and then counting the links and ranking them, this website www.newswhip.com display news based on shares from twitter and Facebook, but i would just link to understand a high level overview of how this would work accordingly
[18:00:35] <Jayro> sacho, can I assign an element more than one id?
[18:00:56] <sacho> no
[18:01:04] <Jayro> then thats why :P
[18:01:26] <sacho> create a map linking the internal ids to the elements they identify
[18:01:40] <Jayro> sacho, how would i do that?
[18:01:45] <sacho> use an object
[18:04:26] <stef123> i have a question, how would i be able to determine the most shared links on twitter, for example one method i was thinking was to get all trends and do a search for that trend returning all links and then counting the links and ranking them, this website www.newswhip.com display news based on shares from twitter and Facebook, but i would just link to understand a high level overview of how this would work accordingly
[18:04:34] <Jayro> sacho, i think i found a better solution, is there a way to get the ID of an element when a user clicks on it?
[18:05:09] <sacho> place a click handler and get it from there
[18:32:07] <syllojizm> how can i use a selector on a jquery object? var t = $('ul'); t.("table") gives me a token error
[18:33:42] <coldhead> some lessons don't come easy
[18:33:58] <coldhead> syllojizm: t.find('.something')
[18:34:04] <coldhead> or $('.someting', t)
[18:34:05] <coldhead> ?find
[18:34:06] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[18:34:12] <syllojizm> ah. right tree traversal. i'm silly.
[18:34:20] <rubatdub> hello
[18:34:48] <rubatdub> i have the following button <button data-object="{&quot;voiture_id&quot;:1, &quot;uid&quot;:9 }" id="1_9" class="">Je veux cette voiture</button>
[18:35:03] <rubatdub> i want to change the value contained in data-object
[18:35:14] <rubatdub> is there an easy way to do that ?
[18:35:23] <thinkt4nk> $.data('object', newValue)
[18:35:34] <thinkt4nk> el.data('object', newValue)
[18:36:10] <thinkt4nk> sorry, disregard my first reply
[18:36:39] <coldhead> that will change what jQuery gets with data()
[18:36:52] <coldhead> it won't change the actual attribute on the element in the DOM
[18:36:58] <coldhead> in case you care about that
[18:37:07] <thinkt4nk> yep, good point
[18:37:14] <rubatdub> yes :)
[18:48:02] <coldhead> andalusians
[19:17:46] <coldhead> fax machine is covered with a greyish green lichen
[19:19:18] <s2013> to convert a form into json do you need to use something like this? http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/serialize-form-to-json/ or will stringify work osmehow?
[19:20:47] <RobW> what
[19:20:52] <RobW> why not just serialize the form and post it
[19:21:15] <coldhead> serialize doesn't produce JSON
[19:21:22] <coldhead> so if you want JSON, use something like you linked
[19:22:11] <coldhead> it's really not hard to do JSON.stringify( { name: $('#name').val(), weight: $('#weight').val(), iq: $('#iq').val() } ):
[19:22:17] <coldhead> see, i just did it
[19:22:25] <coldhead> and i'm basically an idiot

[19:23:16] <boytoy> come on now
[19:23:45] <boytoy> what sex were u again?
[19:23:45] <coldhead> some definitely are
[19:23:57] <s2013> wait so im confused.. should i use that snippet from the link or the stringify
[19:24:00] <coldhead> gender is just a construct, man

[19:26:26] <boytoy> each equally powerful
[19:26:38] <boytoy> i keep getting these messages "yo u know if coldhead is male or female"
[19:27:04] <boytoy> i just serve these dudes smileys saying i dunno
[19:27:06] <coldhead> i'm not sure coldhead knows
[19:27:19] <coldhead> she knows it doesn't matter is all
[19:27:37] <coldhead> AIN'T NOBODY EXERCISING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ALL UP IN THIS JUNK
[19:27:57] <boytoy> y'all heard it first here
[19:28:22] <coldhead> eh, i've been implying it for years
[19:28:47] <coldhead> how about that van dyke parks huh
[19:33:31] <coldhead> dumbstruck with the sweetness of being
[19:40:55] <khmer_> i will now paste the class attribute of a DOM element generated by extjs
[19:40:57] <khmer_> you guys ready
[19:42:12] <coldhead> omg yes
[19:42:22] * coldhead covers herself in vegetable oil
[19:42:26] <khmer_> class="x-panel-header-body x-panel-header-body-beta x-panel-header-body-horizontal x-panel-header-body-beta-horizontal x-panel-header-body-top x-panel-header-body-beta-top x-panel-header-body-docked-top x-panel-header-body-beta-docked-top x-panel-header-body-beta-horizontal x-panel-header-body-beta-top x-panel-header-body-beta-docked-top x-box-layout-ct"
[19:42:31] <coldhead> mmm
[19:42:35] <coldhead> comprehensive
[19:42:42] <khmer_> oocss, everyone
[19:43:40] <Gazpacho> more like ughcss
[19:43:57] <khmer> there's a time and a place for oocss
[19:44:04] <khmer> once this shit happens you are not doing it rite
[19:44:48] <Gazpacho> the time is "never" and the place is "not here"
[19:45:09] <coldhead> that would be a good slogan for a political campaign
[19:45:14] <coldhead> soak up the apathy vote
[19:45:37] <louism2_> Hey guys, this may be semantics but is a Jquery variable meant to only represent dom elements or can they be used as names for string, integers, etc?  Thanks.
[19:47:01] <khmer> louism2_: what do you mean by "jquery variable"
[19:47:13] <louism2_> $variable
[19:47:36] <louism2_> khmer: I could have that concept all wrong
[19:47:38] <khmer> that's a convention meant to represent something that has been jquerified and has the jquery interface
[19:47:51] <khmer> 99% of the time that is a collection of dom elements, yeah
[19:48:02] <louism2_> khmer: cool, thanks for the clarification
[19:48:04] <khmer> under some weird circumstances you can jquerify an object that isn't a dom element
[19:48:36] <coldhead> but if i see $something i expect to be able to do $something.show()
[19:48:45] <louism2_> khmer: like what?  anything off the top of your head come to mind?
[19:48:51] <coldhead> var $something = 'aids lol'; // would make me very unhappy
[19:49:05] <coldhead> unless you're coming to jQuery from BASIC
[19:49:08] <coldhead> in which case welcome
[19:49:33] <louism2_> coldhead: no, just a newb coming from Java
[19:50:19] <coldhead> i will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long face
[19:50:29] <khmer> louism2_: simple pub/sub implementations often use a jquery object for its event bus
[19:50:35] <khmer> louism2_: so you'll see soemthing like
[19:50:42] <khmer> this.$eventBus = $({});
[19:50:49] <khmer> which is just a blank jquery object
[19:51:19] <coldhead> cute example, khmer <3
[19:53:56] <khmer> i get that a lot
[19:55:16] <khmer> also i guess if you're doing a crapload of iterating over an object, and for some reason you hate jeremy ashkenas and his new york upturned nose and his mannerisms and so you won't use underscore, then maybe you jquerify some collection so you can run the .each instance method on it
[19:56:13] <Gazpacho> whaaaaaaat
[19:57:11] <louism2_> khmer: haha, ok
[19:57:18] <louism2_> thanks for the example
[19:57:30] <khmer> best i could do
[19:57:34] <khmer> really it's an edge case
[19:57:44] <khmer> Gazpacho: what can i say, jeremy ashkenas seems fishy to me
[19:57:59] <khmer> why did you go to the trouble of taking the AMD wrapper OUT of your libraries, huh? HUH?
[20:00:08] <coldhead> we are restless things
[20:01:06] <GunniH> http://jsfiddle.net/kNkZR/ -> this (obviously) doesn't work, but can anyone tell me how to do:
[20:01:16] <GunniH> var.find().length();
[20:01:35] <GunniH> var contains html text, as shown in the example
[20:03:04] <coldhead> GunniH: http://jsfiddle.net/kNkZR/1/
[20:03:14] <coldhead> val() doesn't do what you think it does
[20:03:22] <coldhead> and length is a property, not a method()
[20:04:13] <coldhead> so cold
[20:05:23] <coldhead> that's an awfully real gun
[20:05:35] <GunniH> I'm forced into a val though
[20:05:50] <GunniH> basically I'm fetching the data from CKEditor
[20:06:13] <coldhead> mmm but um
[20:06:19] <coldhead> val() is for inputs
[20:06:20] <GunniH> http://pastebin.com/nE5Ykxap
[20:06:38] <GunniH> does not work :<
[20:06:50] <coldhead> no, because you're not applying jQuery
[20:07:03] <coldhead> you're trying to use jQuery's find() on something that isn't jQuerified
[20:07:10] <coldhead> $(data).find(...) might do it
[20:07:13] <GunniH> jQuerified, nice
[20:07:36] <GunniH> nope, I already tried that
[20:07:40] <GunniH> that doesn't do it either
[20:07:55] <coldhead> gross
[20:08:15] <GunniH> just gives me a 0 all da time
[20:08:31] <coldhead> in desparation i'd try $('<div></div>').html(data).find('p').length
[20:08:34] <eddiemonge> what does?
[20:08:57] <coldhead> and if that didn't work i'd go get a stiff drink and maybe look at some man ray photos
[20:09:16] <GunniH> that actually works coldhead
[20:09:21] <GunniH> but
[20:09:24] <GunniH> [03:07:52] <coldhead> gross
[20:09:25] <GunniH> etc.
[20:11:31] <coldhead> using CKeditor is gross
[20:11:35] <coldhead> no way around it
[20:11:44] <coldhead> pragmatism
[20:12:26] <GunniH> point me to a better wysiwyg editor and I'll happily use it
[20:12:52] <coldhead> contenteditable ?
[20:13:06] <coldhead> i kid, they're all awful, it's a painful business
[20:27:35] <abjorn> coldhead: permission to take a break, sir?
[20:27:42] <coldhead> please do
[20:27:43] <coldhead> well earned
[20:31:22] <boytoy> abjorn: surely you mean ma'am not sir?
[20:31:34] * boytoy confused
[20:32:21] <abjorn> it's interchangeable with coldhead
[20:33:19] <boytoy> abjorn: what do u mean by that?
[20:33:59] <coldhead> one day a rose, another a thorn
[20:34:26] <nathanbz> this is a general javascript question i guess
[20:34:30] <s2013> when i make a post request to a server using just js, does it actually save the data? or is it stored locally
[20:34:31] <s2013> how does that work?
[20:35:08] <nathanbz> if i have function(){ var x = new Date() } and that function gets called alot will to create a memory leak
[20:35:23] <sacho> will to wont it
[20:35:30] <nathanbz> I'm pretty sure using var makes it within the scope of the funciton and therefore it will clear later
[20:35:38] <boytoy> yeah not really a fan of innuendos, having to wonder about a thing forever
[20:35:38] <nathanbz> is that correct ?
[20:35:39] <sacho> (depends what context the function is declared in)
[20:36:21] <coldhead> choosing to wonder, boytoy
[20:36:23] <coldhead> choosing
[20:37:08] <nathanbz> sacho http://pastebin.com/BJ6TJPZA
[20:37:10] <sacho> s2013, which data?
[20:37:26] <nathanbz> so refresh.t gets call like every 10 secionds
[20:37:30] <sacho> nathanbz, that's fine.
[20:37:33] <nathanbz> cool
[20:37:39] <coldhead> abjorn: could use your expertise all up in here about now
[20:37:41] <nathanbz> and it's because of the function scope correct ?
[20:37:48] <coldhead> break's over
[20:37:48] <abjorn> okay gimme a sec
[20:37:51] <nathanbz> and cause I used var
[20:38:00] <sacho> Why do you need to create a new date object every 10 seconds?
[20:38:05] <s2013> from a form
[20:38:07] <abjorn> s2013: it's not stored anywhere unless you do it yourself. It just takes the data and sends it
[20:38:10] <nathanbz> its a 24/7 client
[20:38:20] <nathanbz> and I want to force a refresh if the date changes
[20:38:21] <abjorn> nathanbz: no, that doesn't create a memory leak, garbage collector takes care of it
[20:38:32] <s2013> i made a simple form where i added someones name
[20:38:35] <sacho> You could use a single date object.
[20:38:42] <s2013> and it saves it.. but im not using any database
[20:38:45] <s2013> i just followed a tutorial
[20:38:48] <nathanbz> how
[20:38:49] <s2013> cause if i open up the link on a new window
[20:38:51] <abjorn> coldhead: a hard days work
[20:38:52] <nathanbz> don't i need to create 1
[20:38:55] <s2013> or a new browser, it shows that data
[20:38:58] <nathanbz> and get the current one every tick ?
[20:39:20] <sacho> x -> Date, loop-> x.setTime(Date.now())
[20:39:36] <sacho> not that it matters much, really.
[20:39:46] <k_sze[work]> Do newer versions of jquery automatically use IE 8/9's XDomainRequest where appropriate?
[20:39:53] <sacho> why don't you simply set a timer for when the day will change to do this refresh
[20:39:58] <abjorn> you could do what sacho suggested if you're really concerned about performance, but it's not going to make a particularly large impact unless you do it *a lot*
[20:40:15] <nathanbz> sacho cause people sleep thier computers
[20:40:23] <nathanbz> so the timer doesn't tick when the computer goes to sleep
[20:40:39] <sacho> as opposed to your 10 second timer?
[20:40:40] <abjorn> k_sze[work]: long story short, no
[20:40:50] <nathanbz> it will retick when they restore
[20:40:54] <abjorn> you can make your own transport, though, and there's probably a plugin somewhere
[20:41:12] <sacho> ah, ok.
[20:41:57] <abjorn> k_sze[work]: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283 for reference as to why it's not in jQuery
[20:42:16] <k_sze[work]> yeah, I'm reading it right now.
[20:42:25] <abjorn> werd up homie
[20:43:14] <abjorn> oh hank hill, you're so funny

[23:49:26] <coldhead> i don't care for using the DOM as a DB
[23:49:50] <coldhead> i'd store the IDs in a JS array and serialize or JSON it before i had to submit it

[23:56:36] <coldhead> i guess no news is good news?
[23:56:49] <fvdjango> Hi guys, I am using jQuery's .load() function for loading static HTML into a <div> based on what is clicked. The static HTML has javascript and css in it that is not working. I am wondering if, when using the .load() function, you have to include the .js and .css file imports in each piece of HTML that is loaded via jquery?
[23:57:04] <tw2113> good enough
[23:57:13] <coldhead> the CSS should be okay, fvdjango, the JS gets stripped out
[23:57:22] <coldhead> to prevent things being run repeatedly
[23:57:40] <coldhead> you're supposed to .getScript() or init code by some other means if you need it
[23:58:09] <fvdjango> coldhead: Interesting. So in the HTML now, I have a toggle button that lets you choose between showing something or hiding something, using css.
[23:58:20] <fvdjango> coldhead: So I would have to use .getScript() in the imported HTML?
[23:58:37] <fvdjango> coldhead: or, rather: how would you accomplish the same goal?
[23:58:38] <coldhead> no, you would do .getScript in the load callback
[23:59:12] <fvdjango> coldhead: hmm ok, I'll look into that. Thanks (New @ jquery)
