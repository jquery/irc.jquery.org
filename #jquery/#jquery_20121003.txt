[00:00:13] <coldhead> i would try removing the type: 'json' for example
[00:00:17] <coldhead> to see what comes back
[00:00:43] <coldhead> JUST LIKE A MATTRESS BALANCES ON A BOTTLE OF WINE
[00:00:57] <hanasaki> already removed it .. no luck
[00:01:27] <hanasaki> is there a way to get an error or compiler error msg or the return info from the call back to output?
[00:01:51] <coldhead> you should be able to see what's actually being returned in the network tab of the debugger
[00:02:16] <coldhead> hanasaki: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[00:05:15] <hanasaki> my debugger has no network tab ?.....
[00:07:48] <hanasaki> coldhead:  F12 right?
[00:08:12] <coldhead> in Firebug it's the Net tab
[00:08:41] <hanasaki> looks like just a dom inspector
[00:10:05] <coldhead> http://getfirebug.com/network
[00:10:08] <hanasaki> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide16   <= I see this... but no network tab
[00:10:10] <coldhead> should look like those screenshots
[00:12:43] <hanasaki> ok I go the response I expected  ...   "[]"
[00:13:32] <hanasaki> however neither succes or error is called
[00:14:23] <coldhead> and [] is valid json, apperntly
[00:14:28] <coldhead> HMM
[00:14:53] <hanasaki> yes it is
[00:14:54] <hanasaki> http://jsonlint.com/
[00:15:03] <coldhead> man all i would try at this point is consulting the docs for ajax and making sure you're passing the right thing for every single param
[00:15:13] <coldhead> then i'd get a beer and watch some tv
[00:15:39] <hanasaki> rofl dude... where are you?
[00:15:56] <coldhead> australia
[00:16:02] <hanasaki> roo
[00:16:06] <coldhead> we have tv here now
[00:16:09] <hanasaki> rofl
[00:16:10] <coldhead> it's futuristic
[00:16:19] <hanasaki> I hear the tech market is good there
[00:16:20] <hanasaki> and beer
[00:16:35] <coldhead> eh, if you're into those things
[00:16:36] <coldhead> i suppose
[00:16:58] <hanasaki> I just want to get out of kansas lol
[00:17:14] <oksushi> click your heels three times, hanasaki

[00:27:14] <TheHackOps> whowha nice community
[00:27:20] <dns-away> loLa
[00:27:40] <hanasaki> coldhead:  thanks for the help - I did make some progress
[00:27:44] <dns-away> need help with grep\
[00:27:50] <dns-away> wholla :-0
[00:28:06] <dns-away> anyone can help me
[00:28:08] <TheHackOps> So im wondering something, i need to resize dynamic content that never passes through my server (i mean width and height) and im wondering if using the jquery library would be good for this
[00:29:58] <coldhead> try one of the many linux channels, dns-away
[00:30:12] <coldhead> we web devs fear the command line
[00:30:33] <coldhead> what kind of content, TheHackOps?
[00:32:27] <dns-away> coldhead: here is my question. (http://jsfiddle.net/RQNY8/)
[00:32:54] <TheHackOps2> Im sorry i dropped out my network adapter is broken or something
[00:33:20] <TheHackOps2> coldhead, images,swf content,youtube videos
[00:33:22] <TheHackOps2> thats about it
[00:33:23] <TheHackOps2> i think
[00:33:40] <coldhead> well jQuery can help you modify the dimensions in the HTML
[00:34:05] <TheHackOps2> coldhead, i am doing it with plan old js at the moment but im looking for a more fluid and reliable way
[00:34:07] <coldhead> it can't resize the actual media
[00:34:27] <coldhead> its probably not so different with jQuery or plain js
[00:34:28] <TheHackOps2> coldhead, i know what you mean. i just need it to make the content display right
[00:34:35] <coldhead> just string manipulation
[00:34:50] <TheHackOps2> is it worth using the jQuery lib?
[00:35:25] <coldhead> it's almost always worth using jQuery
[00:35:36] <coldhead> if you hate typing document.getElementById then jQuery is your friend
[00:35:48] <coldhead> it depends what else you need to do with this data
[00:35:49] <TheHackOps2> i lovehate javascript
[00:36:12] <|pez|> hehe, agreed, TheHackOps2
[00:36:28] <TheHackOps2> coldhead, Im not hosting the content but rather embeding it from hotlinked sources by users
[00:37:15] <TheHackOps> I wish i had a front end developer on this project since its huge but i dont
[00:37:23] <TheHackOps> so im stuck learning all this stuff
[00:38:03] <coldhead> in that case you should use jQuery and make your life easier
[00:38:15] <coldhead> it's really not hard and makes browser stuff suck much less
[00:38:17] <TheHackOps> Well thanks, that cleared up for me
[00:38:29] <coldhead> also this lovely channel will treat you with respect and tender care
[00:38:34] <coldhead> unlike my recent sexualpartners
[00:38:40] <TheHackOps> ouch
[00:38:41] <TheHackOps> burn
[00:38:59] <TheHackOps> am i allowed to link my project here
[00:39:00] <TheHackOps> or no?
[00:39:03] <|pez|> respect is good, but tender care? I like it a bit rough XD
[00:39:21] <coldhead> of course you can link here
[00:39:33] <coldhead> just don't spew more than one line of code into the channel
[00:39:56] <TheHackOps> http://www.randomrefresh.info/
[00:40:04] <TheHackOps> so as you can see my site looks pretty trashy
[00:40:36] <TheHackOps> im adding heaps more but i just wana sort out the layout stuff first
[00:42:55] <TheHackOps> If anyones looking for an interesting project to get involved with i would be for ever greatful
[00:44:19] <xec_> TheHackOps: if you're looking to hire someone, you can try #css-lance
[00:44:55] <TheHackOps> Not hire but work with someone else
[00:47:05] <dns-away> Anyone can help me ?
[00:47:13] <TheHackOps> dns-away, sure
[00:47:16] <dns-away> jsfiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/w3y32/)
[00:47:18] <TheHackOps> whats the problem officor
[00:47:52] <TheHackOps> what are you trying to do?
[00:48:53] <dns-away> I should fetch only classes with numbers different from current file.
[00:49:01] <dns-away> from another file
[00:49:20] <xec_> dns-away: you could do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/w3y32/1/
[00:49:27] <dns-away> functuon(data) is data from 'another file' I should filter and get only unique classes. :-)
[00:49:57] <dns-away> yes, tu ;1
[00:50:06] <xec_> dns-away: or, better: $(data).filter("p")
[00:50:24] <xec_> (shorter, rather)
[00:50:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/w3y32/2/
[00:50:54] <dns-away> okay, xec_ tu
[00:50:56] <dns-away> :-)
[00:53:26] <TheHackOps> Sounds easier in php but hey im new to js dev so yeh
[00:55:27] <xec_> TheHackOps: what does?
[00:55:40] <TheHackOps> any kind of file handling
[00:56:09] <xec_> well, there is no file handling in js
[01:01:42] <TheHackOps> isn't that what hes trying to d
[01:01:44] <TheHackOps> do
[01:01:56] <dns-away> More one questions, if is possible.
[01:02:06] <dns-away> URL/(http://jsfiddle.net/W6vHT/)
[01:03:15] <dns-away> It can make maybe without each; :-)
[01:03:55] <xec_> ?mdc push
[01:04:25] <xec_> dns-away: you can use array.push(newValue) to add to the array
[01:05:26] <dns-away> Do you know other method /?
[01:06:28] <dns-away> still this is good idea
[01:07:58] <xec_> i'm not sure what you're doing with the array though
[01:08:03] <xec_> what's the use case?
[01:09:11] <dns-away> very easy trick.
[01:09:47] <dns-away> But works. for now .:-)
[01:09:53] <dns-away> it * :-)
[01:10:04] <dns-away> Thank you very match for your help. :-)

[01:20:15] <arch_adam> hi, if i am inserting elements into the dom on an onClick event, how can i make i select them with jQuery? the selectors do not seem to detect the element when i try to select them
[01:20:57] <xec_> arch_adam: run the selector after the insertion
[01:21:18] <arch_adam> not a candidate for .live() then
[01:21:31] <xec_> no, that's for event binding only
[01:23:48] <dns-away> xec_, can yuo take a look
[01:24:07] <arch_adam> xec:  but i want to run the even onclick, i have a ajax results form, so when i search for a store it will return a bunch of results injected into the dom
[01:24:17] <dns-away> (url)(http://jsfiddle.net/UgQmb/)
[01:24:33] <arch_adam> then the results i have an a tag that i want to be clickable to run a function / event
[01:24:54] <arch_adam> make sense dude?
[01:27:54] <dns-away> btw -http://jsfiddle.net/UgQmb/2/
[01:29:09] <JaredE> I have some json that looks like: [Object { id="1",  label="Car",  value="1"}, Object { id="3",  label="Van",  value="3"}] when i console.log it, how can i turn the id part into an array?
[01:31:08] <arch_adam> yep it was .live i needed!
[01:33:30] <xec_> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/UgQmb/4/
[01:33:54] <xec_> dns-away: the logic was fine, you just had some syntax errors
[01:34:33] <dns-away> btw - ok,
[01:34:40] <dns-away> thanks
[01:34:41] <xec_> JaredE: what do you want the resulting array to look like? ["1", "3"] etc?
[01:34:53] <quicksilver> JaredE: $.map(thatjson,function(){ return this.id });
[01:35:32] <quicksilver> oops, $.map doesn't use "this"
[01:35:45] <quicksilver> JaredE: $.map(thatjson,function(obj){ return obj.id });
[01:35:48] <quicksilver> ^^ that, instead.
[01:36:27] <dns-away> Thank you.
[01:37:11] <JaredE> yep that looks to work, thanks

[02:24:01] <alky> hi guys, i have bind a "tap" event on a container div but the handler is inhereted by the child divs. i want the children to have their unique handlers and not to call the parent handler when tap-ed. I have tried using event.preventDefault but it still calls both handlers
[02:25:32] <nights> jesus
[02:25:35] <nights> always when i download a new bootstrap version everything is fucked up
[02:25:37] <nights> god if they could make up their mind once and for all
[02:26:13] <Lurzino> I have three selects which have change events to populate other selects when doing manually... if I do by code looks like it doesn't work, tried also to force fire change() event with blur() but without results... here the code: http://pastebin.com/VWcMLQNm .... any direction would be appreciate!... Thanks in advance to all!
[02:27:23] <alky> this is my one http://pastebin.com/FUWg2rZN
[02:27:51] <alky> interesting thing is that if i alert event.target.id it is blank. have i done something wrong?
[02:31:35] <alky> what do you see when you alert your "options"? does it look like valid html?
[02:32:17] <Lurzino> practically in my issue if I select an option by code with prop('selected'...) the select doesn't show the option properly selected to fire the change() event even if the ID is correct.... any direction?
[02:39:50] <alky> see if this helps you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031826/jquery-change-function-not-working-with-dynamically-populated-select-list
[02:40:37] <alky> they are saying you should not use .change but use .bind instead

[02:57:00] <iSeeDeadPixels> serializing a form excludes unchecked checkboxes, how to fix?
[02:58:33] <HyperXSystems> You might be able to just check for the existence or non existence of the form field at the other end, would that help?
[02:58:50] <HyperXSystems> thats generally how I do it iSeeDeadPixels
[02:59:08] <iSeeDeadPixels> would take too much time
[02:59:18] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm attempting to port a normal form submit to a ajax one
[03:00:43] <HyperXSystems> The other way i have done it (if you're in a hurry) is to serialise the form and then deserialize it, manually check the checkbox stats, add it to the object and send the resulting object as the data parameter
[03:06:17] <blackspotwiggins> iSeeDeadPixels, unchecked boxes are meant to be left out
[03:06:42] <blackspotwiggins> if you need to capture the unchecked state, add a hidden field with same name and value="false" or similar
[03:28:51] <Biomech> anyone have any links for placing a 50% white transparent box over an image on mouseover and that containg the same text for every image? (ie, i have a stack of image links I want onmouseover to show "visit website")
[03:32:34] <datarecall> can you do this inline : $('#Menus').slideDown().toggleClass('menusactive',true).toggleClass('menus',false);
[03:43:49] <xec_> datarecall: what do you mean "inline"
[03:45:34] <xec_> datarecall: if you want to toggle the classnames after the sliding is done you can use a callback, if that's what you're after
[03:49:50] <fRAiLtY-> Is the correct way to say not equal to? if (selectedTurnaround.length != 19 || selectedTurnaround.length != 0)
[03:49:58] <fRAiLtY-> It seems to be ignoring these statements
[03:50:18] <Lurzino> hello everyone again.... I tried the bind('change', function() {....}); thing to fire change event as you can see in this code http://pastebin.com/fMjgcev5 inside the function openItem() but once the option is selected looks like the bind('change'...) doesn't fire because it doesn't appear the alert thing inside function() { }..... may I have forgot something? Thanks in advance to everyone...
[03:51:54] <xec_> fRAiLtY-: that's always going to be true. if length is 19 it
[03:52:02] <xec_> 's not going to be 0
[03:52:25] <xec_> maybe you wanted && ? what are you trying to do?
[03:52:35] <fRAiLtY-> xec_:  Yep, my bad

[04:46:45] <yannickoo> Hey guys, can anybody tell me why jQuery replaces the Ã„ only one time? http://jsfiddle.net/PBzJc/
[04:48:01] <seutje> yannickoo: use the global flag
[04:48:19] <yannickoo> seutje: global flag?
[04:49:00] <j_wright> so that the replace runs on any occurrences, not just the first
[04:49:02] <seutje> yannickoo: http://jsfiddle.net/PBzJc/1/
[04:49:26] <yannickoo> seutje: so /X/g ist the magic?
[04:49:40] <seutje> yannickoo: it's a regex with a global flag
[04:49:48] <yannickoo> seutje: ah okay, thank you :)
[04:49:54] <seutje> yan see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[04:49:57] <seutje> FINE!
[04:50:15] <fusion271> the magic of regex
[04:55:25] <yannickoo> And can anybody tell me how I can fix the behavior that on any key (CMD/STRG, arrow keys) the cursor goes to the end? http://jsfiddle.net/PBzJc/3/

[05:24:48] <thorphet> hi
[05:25:21] <koopa> hi everyone! I have a trouble with detecting key press in google chrome and I was hoping someone could help me ?
[05:27:56] <thorphet> I need help firing a qtip tooltip inside an ajax success call. The ajax post is inside a click function of a button: http://pastebin.com/BChi7AhC
[05:33:17] <thorphet> can someone help me?
[05:34:22] <seutje> thorphet: $.ajax returns a jQuery XHR object, u can store stuff on there and access it in the success handler
[05:34:48] <seutje> thorphet: like http://jsfiddle.net/J7srS/
[05:38:44] <koopa> Can anyone help with a problem with .keypress() function in google chrome please?
[05:38:51] <thorphet> seutje: the problem I have is the tooltip doesn't show when the success call is executed
[05:39:48] <seutje> thorphet: is "elemen" what you think it is in the success handler?
[05:39:56] <seutje> "element"*
[05:40:05] <thorphet> oh
[05:40:06] <thorphet> hm
[05:40:28] <thorphet> thought so
[05:42:59] <mg983> Good mroning!
[05:43:02] <mg983> *morning
[05:43:46] <mg983> I am trying to put together a jQuery UI interface connecting 2 lists where you can drop from a left list to a right listâ€¦ the thing is I want placeholders like http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/8448141/baseball-best-team has â€¦ how can I achieve this
[05:45:00] <seutje> thorphet: then what's the problem?
[05:45:31] <fr4nk235> hi guys!
[05:46:00] <seutje> mg983: jquery ui's draggable and sortable both support placeholders
[05:46:27] <mg983> I don't see any demos or documentation on how to make that work on jQuery UI's pageâ€¦ either that or I am blind :)
[05:46:51] <fr4nk235> i sort some elements (which a links -> anchor tag), but if i stop sorting the link will be triggerd, tried preventDefault() already but doesnt word, any ideas?
[05:47:26] <seutje> mg983: well, uhm... maybe it's time for another visit to the eye doctor :x http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#placeholder
[05:47:50] <mg983> seutje: That's not what I meant by placeholder
[05:48:02] <mg983> seutje: did you follow that espn like by any chance
[05:48:50] <seutje> mg983: yeah, and I noticed if u drag too fast, it sorta kinda breaks
[05:49:01] <mg983> be that as it may
[05:49:33] <seutje> oh snap, u can just click these bastards
[05:50:06] <mg983> pretty nifty
[05:50:11] <fr4nk235> uh oh does work fine except in firefox o.O
[05:52:16] <thorphet> seutje: it doesn't fire. First I had the qtip configured with a show on jquery event, like "  show: {event: 'mousemove'} "
[05:52:19] <seutje> so... ok don't tell me what u did mean by placeholder
[05:52:55] <thorphet> that worked, but of course only when I moved my mouse (after clicking the button)
[05:53:27] <thorphet> ideally I want to user to click the button, execute the ajax call, and have the qtip tooltip shown
[05:53:40] <thorphet> I want the user*
[05:53:49] <reloadz> hi! i need to make jquery selector, but i don't know how! my example: <d1><d2/><d2/><d2/><d2/><d3/></d1>
[05:54:16] <thorphet> reloadz: what do you want to do with it?
[05:54:27] <reloadz> I need to append next <d2> between last <d2>and <d3>
[05:55:15] <thorphet> $('d2:last-child').append('<d2></d2>')
[05:55:26] <reloadz> thx
[05:55:57] <thorphet> seutje: do you understand my problem now?
[05:56:04] <seutje> not rly
[05:56:12] <seutje> why don't u just use qtip's ajax shizzle?
[05:58:05] <fr4nk235> why firefox tiggers the onclick attr when i stop sorting and other browsers dont? ~.~
[05:59:59] <Lurzino> anyone can't tell me why the bind in openItem function here http://pastebin.com/2S0CyLht doesn't fire and showing the alert() thing?....
[06:01:10] <fr4nk235> strange behavior, now all browser except opera trigger the onclick, wthf
[06:08:52] <seutje> thorphet: hmz, I guess qtip is a bit silly, remove that "show" and add a trigger('mouseover') after the qtip call, like http://jsfiddle.net/YJudz/1/
[06:11:54] <thorphet> seutje: I already tried that. The thing is with the 'mouseover' it doesn't show directly after clicking the button, instead you have to leave the button with cursor and then when you re-enter (hover) the qtip shows :S
[06:12:13] <jugstah> anyone familiar with the jquery tools slideshow portion?
[06:12:28] <seutje> thorphet: did u look at the link I pasted?
[06:12:42] <seutje> cause I don't have to move my mouse after clicking in that example
[06:13:07] <thorphet> weird
[06:13:13] <thorphet> I tried that jsfiddle
[06:13:19] <thorphet> but I have to move my mouse first
[06:13:27] <thorphet> Chrome osx v21
[06:13:38] <seutje> chrome OSX v22 here
[06:13:41] <seutje> it takes 2 seconds though
[06:13:50] <seutje> lemme lower the delay
[06:14:03] <thorphet> oh yea
[06:14:05] <thorphet> let me check again
[06:14:15] <seutje> maybe this will circumvent your impatience: http://jsfiddle.net/YJudz/2/
[06:14:19] <thorphet> ok going to try it
[06:14:20] <thorphet> thx
[06:14:35] <seutje> if it really need a mouseover event, just give it one :D
[06:14:38] <seutje> needs*
[06:16:46] <thorphet> seutje: I could kiss you man. Thanks!
[06:16:53] <thorphet> finally works
[06:17:02] <seutje> I don't rly swing that way, sry
[06:17:07] <thorphet> lol
[06:17:17] <seutje> I like beer though... :P
[06:17:34] <pachet> you crazy car, i don't know whether to kiss you or eat you
[06:18:09] <thorphet> :p
[06:18:29] <seutje> you *eat* cars?
[06:18:36] <seutje> are you truck-o-saurus?
[06:18:57] <pachet> that's the quote!
[06:19:00] <pachet> seutje wins
[06:19:38] <jugstah> lmao
[06:19:46] <jugstah> the visual is traumatizing.
[06:20:02] <seutje> lol
[06:20:06] <seutje> this shit is real! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54H-paSYhHg
[06:20:18] <fusion271> mk
[06:20:35] <thorphet> hmm
[06:20:42] <Lurzino> anyone could tell me why the bind in openItem function here http://pastebin.com/2S0CyLht doesn't fire and showing the alert() thing?.... thanks in advance... :-))))
[06:22:16] <seutje> I ain't touching that :x
[06:22:33] <reloadz> thorphet: your selector dont work! because of my misteake in example!

[06:23:35] <beasty> morning guys
[06:23:39] <beasty> i have an issue
[06:23:43] <_zoggy_> visieble?
[06:23:46] <reloadz> i need to add to the one that is visivle
[06:24:06] <pachet> visevil
[06:24:17] <reloadz> visible!
[06:24:17] <thorphet> seutje: now I have a different problem. your fix let it fire alright. But now every time I hover over a button I clicked before, it fires the qtip again. It should only fire once
[06:24:43] <pachet> ?ask @ beasty
[06:24:44] <bot-t> beasty, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:27:19] <reloadz> any ideas how i can make that selector?
[06:28:00] <pachet> Lurzino: try console.logging two things : a) $('#selectproducts'), b) data.Ref_products_ID
[06:28:26] <mowol> I need to set a cookie with the value of my ajax success function. How do i do this?
[06:28:57] <mowol> if i just use document.cookie = 'name=' + value it doesnt work
[06:29:12] <mowol> but if i manually sets value to 'something' it works
[06:30:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[06:30:42] <pachet> mowol: any elaboration on 'doesnt work'? can you log that value to make sure it's what you think it should be?
[06:31:12] <mowol> pachet: if i use alert(value) i see the string that i want to put into a cookie
[06:31:46] <mvk> within my $(this).closest('#somediv') i have a number of childer (somewhere up the dom tree..) with the class '.someclass'
[06:32:11] <mvk> how do i itterate trough those after getting hold of  $(this).closest('#somediv')?
[06:32:51] <beasty> mm this is weird
[06:32:56] <jugglinmike> mkv by "up the dom tree", you mean "descendants", right?
[06:33:02] <mvk> yes
[06:33:05] <jugglinmike> ok
[06:33:22] <jugglinmike> $(this).closest('#somediv').find(".someclass")
[06:33:38] <mvk> super, forgot about find :- )))
[06:34:32] <thorphet> seutje: did you see my previous question? Now the qtip fires on every mouseover (after clicking the button), unwanted behaviour
[06:35:04] <seutje> thorphet: hmz, that's default qtip I think
[06:35:09] <seutje> damn plugins and their assumptions
[06:35:11] <seutje> hang on
[06:36:11] <docmur> When I have a select function for autocomplete I can call ui.item.value and get the information from the form,  If I want to send that to a PHP file would would the actual id be that I should reference in PHP, the call to PHP is $('#status').load('add.php',ui.item.value);
[06:36:28] <ddssc> why do my site cookies get crammed into every ajax request? like I would do $.get ('script.php',arguments,suscess()); and it will automatically cram cookie data in arguments
[06:36:36] <Lurzino> pachet: doing that I get: a) [select#selectproducts.selectproducts] and b) 8
[06:36:45] <seutje> thorphet: just make it fire on a custom event: http://jsfiddle.net/YJudz/4/ :D
[06:37:40] <Lurzino> pachet: which in fact makes the thing not binding 'change' event weird since the element exists and the id is a value...
[06:37:45] <pachet> mowol: guess i'd have to see an example to be more help. are you manually setting the expiry and path? if not, try that
[06:38:13] <thorphet> seutje: thanks!
[06:40:07] <pachet> ddssc: are you sure? cookies get added to xml requests, yes, but they shouldn't be added to the actual querystring (in the case of a get) or the post body
[06:41:27] <pachet> Lurzino: odd, i guess try replicating the issue in a fiddle
[06:43:41] <ddssc> pachet, yes I just forgot that ajax requests actually send all the stuff that regular http requests send, and that includes all the cookies, session etc...
[06:43:46] <beasty> hmm is it possible that i can't hide elements in a tabbed layout ?
[06:43:48] <Lurzino> pachet:  the matter is the queryItem.php queries a database...
[06:44:11] <ddssc> when testing on my local machine, this stuff doesnt get sent, but on actual online servers it does
[06:44:42] <thorphet> beasty: why couldn't you?
[06:46:18] <mowol> pachet: http://pastebin.com/zXr8GTws
[06:46:44] <ocdcoder> beasty: are you positive your selector is getting the appropriate elements?
[06:51:00] <tlkr> ddssc that is because cookies are sent to the domain from which they were set
[06:51:13] <tlkr> otherwise all your cookies would be sent to everything.
[06:55:01] <nights> anyone using bootstrap?
[06:55:32] <fusion27> Twitter Bootstrap?
[06:55:50] <fusion27> I've done 2 projects with it so far, more in the pipeline
[06:59:41] <jle2002> hi
[06:59:49] <jle2002> is there a way to tell if a dropdownlist is open or not
[06:59:58] <xec_> i usually just look at it
[07:00:17] <jle2002> i mean in in javascript or jquery
[07:00:33] <xec_> i know, i was just being a dick ;)
[07:01:11] <jle2002> can i read the attr with jquery
[07:01:14] <jle2002> like size?
[07:01:15] <xec_> but no - i don't think there's a property you can look for
[07:01:43] <xec_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709474/is-there-a-way-to-determine-if-a-select-dropdown-menu-is-open
[07:01:48] <xec_> google found me this
[07:02:49] <xec_> ?anyone @ nights
[07:02:51] <bot-t> nights, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[07:08:03] <xec_> nights: that said, i think you're probably better off in #twitter-bootstrap
[07:11:09] <mowol> why doesnt the first cookie creating work? http://pastebin.com/zXr8GTws
[07:20:12] <kzrdt> hi
[07:20:20] <dns-away> guyz :-)
[07:21:58] <kzrdt> I'm trying to load json to populate multiple select with .getJSON in a loop, the problem is : as the call is asynchronous, it only applies to my last select
[07:22:10] <kzrdt> is it possible to pass an id to this function?
[07:22:11] <hlve> morning guys
[07:22:25] <kzrdt> it isn't very clear I know
[07:24:16] <kzrdt> here is my code
[07:24:17] <kzrdt> http://pastebin.com/pBbtnYF4
[07:24:19] <BillCriswell> kzrdt: The .getJSON call gets the data for all the dropdowns?
[07:24:46] <kzrdt> the datas are different for each dropdown
[07:25:08] <kzrdt> as I must repopulate cascade dropdown from a value
[07:25:27] <BillCriswell> So you're performing a .getJSON for each select?
[07:25:40] <kzrdt> yes
[07:25:56] <kzrdt> Maybe I'm doing something awful
[07:26:45] <kzrdt> I'm not very good with js, and it has been a great improvement for just being able to obtain that :p
[07:26:58] <BillCriswell> I'm just usually bad at understanding things and I want to make sure I have it right haha.
[07:27:30] <BillCriswell> kzrdt: What is a "showrome", a <select>?
[07:29:29] <kzrdt> showrome is an input with the value needed to repopulate the select
[07:30:22] <kzrdt> as I change the different dropdown select, it changes the value of this input, and this is the value that is saved in db
[07:30:58] <kzrdt> as I edit my form, I want to be able to recreate the dropdown as they were with my value
[07:31:27] <kzrdt> I hope it helps to understand my problematic
[07:31:44] <BillCriswell> kzrdt: I'm actually a lot more confused now.
[07:32:23] <kzrdt> arf :/
[07:32:48] <kzrdt> I've got a value like A1512 in my showrome input
[07:33:19] <dns-away> How are you
[07:33:24] <dns-away> peoples
[07:33:25] <dns-away> :/
[07:33:53] <kzrdt> the first select as value with A,B,C...etc and makes the first char of showrome value
[07:33:57] <BillCriswell> I am good, person.
[07:34:28] <kzrdt> and it goes on for 2 or 3 select for the rest of the showrome value
[07:34:40] <BillCriswell> Besides my girlfriend hitting her snooze button more than 10 times this morning two hours before I needed to wake up...
[07:35:25] <pachet> yeah mine does that too
[07:35:29] <pachet> except she uses her cell phone
[07:35:52] <pachet> on vibrate, and it always ends up trapped between the covers somewhere, so its way more work to find it than to ignore it
[07:36:02] <mowol> i myself do that, and that annoys my girlfriend :D
[07:36:47] <BillCriswell> pachet: Same, she actually uses both of ours.  She'll set mine for 5:15 and hers for 5:25 hit snooze on each no less than 5 times every morning.
[07:38:34] <BillCriswell> mowol: If my girlfriend was a dude I'd have definitely had a fist fight with her by now because of this.
[07:39:14] <mowol> BillCriswell: well i guess it depends on your schedules. She has to get up for school.. I dont
[07:40:12] <toter> Hiâ€¦ I've been trying to incorporate this plugin into twitter's bootstrap: http://pagescroller.com/. Could you guys give any directions on how to accomplish that? I am a beginner and I would like to add a nice, smooth scrolling animation when you click on an option in the sidebar.
[07:41:36] <seutje> guys, jQuery.support.fixedPosition was removed from the jQueries, right?
[07:41:54] <BillCriswell> toter: Came across this yesterday, might be better off with it? http://www.larentis.eu/bootstrap_toggle_buttons/
[07:43:26] <BillCriswell> It was built for bootstrap obviously.
[07:44:41] <jarr0dsz> so i really dont like jquery ui
[07:44:46] <toter> BillCriswell: Thanks for the tip. It is actually a very nice idea. What I'm looking for though is just a simple, nice, smooth scrolling animation when you click on something. I tried 4 or 5 plugins that does this, but somehow I can't make it work. That's why I'm asking for help.
[07:44:50] <jarr0dsz> but with the aristo theme it looks decent for the first time ever
[07:45:04] <jarr0dsz> you guys could advise me on a replacement for jquery ui?
[07:45:09] <cliffer> how can i achieve an $(".image").error(function(){ be fired every 5 secs?
[07:45:42] <pachet> ?g mdn settimeout @ cliffer
[07:45:57] <bot-t> pachet, No results found for 'mdn settimeout'.
[07:46:04] <dns-away> cliffer: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
[07:46:31] <pachet> :[ well, you get what i was going for. or setInterval, but i prefer to just call setTimeout recursively
[07:47:19] <cliffer> it tried settimeout, but the function should be called every 5 secs if image has an error
[07:47:23] <BillCriswell> toter: Are you just trying to scroll to a specific part of the page?
[07:47:44] <cliffer> but with settimeout, every function call is only delayed 5 secs but fires 10 times a second
[07:49:17] <cliffer> mhh, i had settimeout in error, perhaps error in settimeout
[07:49:25] <toter> For example, when you click on any option on the top menu of this website, http://pagescroller.com/, the page smoothly goes to another section of the page. I just want to implement that animation.
[07:54:49] <jarr0dsz> anyone can recommend a clean user interface framework or library for jquery ( not jquery ui ?) ?
[07:55:40] <ocdcoder> jarr0dsz: have you tried twitter bootstrap?
[07:55:43] <BillCriswell> toter: http://jsfiddle.net/ze8mW/ could work, and you can use bootstraps scrollspy with it to keep the current item highlighted.
[07:55:57] <jarr0dsz> yes i know twitter bootstrap its just some css.. i more mean a jquery way of coding interfaces
[07:56:06] <jarr0dsz> like ember but than not ember cause thats not a real solution atm
[07:56:25] <jle2002> is there a changed event for textboxes and checkboxes?
[07:56:37] <toter> BillCriswell: Thank you. I'll try that.
[07:56:44] <BillCriswell> toter: http://jsfiddle.net/ze8mW/1/ makes more sense, sorry.
[07:56:52] <toter> BillCriswell: ok
[07:56:56] <ocdcoder> jle2002: do you mean when typing or 'onchange'?
[07:57:02] <jle2002> onchange
[07:57:11] <BillCriswell> I was removing a # just to add a #.... Logical.
[07:57:11] <jle2002> is there?
[07:57:16] <cliffer> http://pastebin.com/nQcsx1XU - i tried to fire an error event every 5 seconds, can someone pls have a look at this: http://pastebin.com/nQcsx1XU
[07:57:22] <jle2002> i mean whats the difference between typing and onchange?
[07:59:51] <jarr0dsz> http://www.jeasyui.com/demo/index.php seems nice but i need more for backbone.js
[08:01:20] <ocdcoder> jle2002: nothing, i was thinking of something else (http://api.jquery.com/change/, btw)
[08:01:23] <jugstah> anyone here familiar with jquery tools? specifically the tabs/slideshow portion?
[08:01:50] <jugstah> It stops the slideshow on the last tab and doesn't reset to the first tab
[08:01:51] <jugstah> any ideas?
[08:01:57] <jle2002> how do i add two classes to an input tag?
[08:02:06] <jle2002> just do class="one two"
[08:02:07] <jle2002> liket hat?
[08:02:33] <BillCriswell> toter: Playing with this more, ended up with this: http://jsfiddle.net/ze8mW/3/
[08:02:37] <ocdcoder> jle2002: yup

[08:16:07] <kroniksenvy> anyone here familiar with CL Editor a WYSIWYG
[08:27:07] <bfig> hello, how can i insert and then slide in div i just built?
[08:27:17] <bfig> a div*
[08:29:44] <bfig> say i have my div with all it's things in a certain javascript variable called 'markup', then i want to add that variable to a div and slide it into view
[08:30:49] <ocdcoder> bfig: create the div in jquery, append it to whatever element you want (important step), then use jquery ui animations
[08:31:11] <bfig> what do you mean by creating it in jquery?
[08:31:32] <bfig> right now i'm just making a javascript string and appending it with jquery, is that enough?
[08:31:44] <bfig> (ie, is that what you mean?)
[08:31:50] <bluesm> Hi.
[08:32:24] <bluesm> What does mean. "$"
[08:32:31] <bluesm> Same "$"
[08:32:33] <ocdcoder> bfig: $('div') <-- creates an element in jquery
[08:32:44] <ocdcoder> more specifically, a div
[08:32:52] <bluesm> such us "$.proxy"
[08:33:06] <bluesm> I mean, if this is a huge superior object in jquery ?
[08:33:19] <bfig> doesn't that select all divs in the page?
[08:34:05] <ocdcoder> bfig: oops, $('<div></div>') or something like that. gimme a sec
[08:34:14] <cliffer> how is it possible to fire an error event only every 5 secs? i tried with http://pastebin.com/nQcsx1XU
[08:34:37] <ocdcoder> bfig: $(body).appendTo("<div></div>")
[08:35:10] <bfig> ok, so it is just using the append functions
[08:35:24] <bfig> i am using $(somewhere).append(mydivstring)
[08:35:34] <ocdcoder> cliffer: try setinterval, not settimeout
[08:35:58] <ocdcoder> bfig: yup append (not appendto, sorry i still need my coffee)
[08:36:23] <ocdcoder> bfig: then you can use http://api.jquery.com/animate/ to move it
[08:37:20] <ocdcoder> bfig: $(body).appendTo('<div id="mydiv"></div>'); $('#mydiv').animate({/* params here */});
[08:37:59] <bfig> so how do i roll it from the top?
[08:38:50] <cliffer> ocdcoder: the result is: http://pastebin.com/UA84Rafb
[08:39:06] <bluesm> What is the $ ?
[08:39:12] <bluesm> in $.proxy ?
[08:39:14] <kroniksenvy> Im using this http://premiumsoftware.net/cleditor/ yet the editor keeps overriding my <textarea value="<?php ... ?>"> how can i add value to my textarea that has cleeditor appent
[08:39:42] <silverwind> bluesm: A function, it could be called "rofl" instead
[08:40:01] <silverwind> But the jQuery guys decided to use $
[08:40:47] <bluesm> silverwind: Not the "proxy", I mean what is $?
[08:40:56] <ajpiano> it's jQuery
[08:41:06] <snover> kroniksenvy: that might have something to do with the fact that there is no value attribute on textareas.
[08:42:30] <ocdcoder> bfig: i wouldn't want to take away that learning experience from you (http://api.jquery.com/animate/) :)
[08:42:45] <bfig> cool, did it :)
[08:42:57] <bluesm> ajpiano: Jquery main object ?
[08:42:58] <bfig> just started from 'display:none' and slideDown'ed
[08:43:01] <ajpiano> yes
[08:43:09] <ajpiano> jQuery has static functions that live on window.jQuery
[08:43:19] <silverwind> bluesm $ is an alias to jQuery, so you could do: jQuery.proxy instead
[08:44:41] <ocdcoder> bfig: yup :)
[08:45:13] <bluesm> silverwind, ajpiano: Ok, thank very much :)
[08:47:06] <cliffer> can someone pls have a look at http://pastebin.com/UA84Rafb expected outout: outer, inner, outer, inner if image cannot be loaded
[08:47:40] <cliffer> outout = output
[08:48:52] <[fields]> I'm using jquery ui autocomplete on a phonegap (mobile) app, it seems like there is some bizarre behavior that occurs on my forms where 2 inputs (last one chosen + current chosen) have focus sometimes.  Has anyone seen this or can suggest what can be applied to stop this bizarre behavior?
[08:49:20] <superlukas> is there a neat way to make an anchor unselectable?
[08:49:41] <superlukas> *not selectable
[08:49:54] <fusion27> [fields]: are you using jQueryUI Touch Punch? http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[08:50:12] <[fields]> fusion27: afaik, no
[08:50:34] <[fields]> oh, looks like something I should be using
[08:51:04] <fusion27> I wonder if your events are getting mangled
[08:51:28] <[fields]> I will give it a try, thank you for the response.
[08:51:53] <fusion27> shouldn't take you too long to get implemented, good luck!
[09:12:58] <bubu> my forms will sometimes (randomly) submit multiple times... any ideas why?
[09:13:52] <bfig> if i do this `jQuery(".someclass")`, do newly instantiated members of the class get hooked in the action?
[09:14:04] <bfig> or do i need to rebind?
[09:14:23] <bfig> (in that case, are rebindings redundant or can you make multiple binds?
[09:14:27] <bubu> bfig: look into the on() function
[09:14:36] <bfig> ok
[09:15:13] <bubu> it basically allows you to bind to dynamically added elements
[09:15:32] <cliffer> can someone pls look at http://pastebin.com/6LsFSK6M, i changed it several times now but i dont know why error is firing 2x or 3x
[09:18:10] <kroniksenvy> k
[09:21:58] <Che-Anarc> Any1 used /  using mediaelementplayer.js ? I'm having a hard time understanding how I can dynamicaly clone and set the source of empty video players
[09:28:38] <at[o]m> hi
[09:39:31] <emattias> How can I listen for all the images to be loaded in when the images are loaded dynamically?
[09:39:50] <emattias> They are added with ajax
[09:45:16] <bluesm> Hey.
[09:46:09] <bfig> bubu, thanks :)
[09:46:17] <bfig> worked great

[09:58:00] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone, nayone an idea how i could do this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12713244/replicate-facebook-instant-messenger-modal-expand-collapse-ui-with-jquery-jqu ?
[09:58:26] <jarr0dsz> i want to expand an collapse a facebook clone instant messenger i have been looking for components to use
[09:58:38] <jarr0dsz> if components at all perhaps show hide div's could do it, not sure best approach
[09:58:56] <daslicious> nope, seems cool though
[09:59:00] <jarr0dsz> already have the divs and ui , css done now only want to figure out a clean way of coding this behaviour anyone an idea?
[09:59:20] <jarr0dsz> daslicious: it incluses stophe and xmpp connection wich i already have in basics, basically same setup as facebook has
[10:00:12] <jarr0dsz> the friendlist would be a div that will be expanded, collapsed. could even be just a resize of format wich is easy
[10:00:18] <daslicious> i'm a developer and just got the word from a co worker to check out ircâ€¦ this is fantastic
[10:00:32] <jarr0dsz> daslicious: welcome to the wonderfull world of irc ;)
[10:01:04] <daslicious> hehe, great to be here, good luck, i should probably do some coding of my own soon ;)
[10:01:17] <daslicious> otherwise the boss the frowns :(
[10:01:17] <Bonnie> I need to add a link to the jqgrid caption using  caption: 'Expenses <a href="#HelpLink">Help</a>', the link shows up but nothing happens when i click it
[10:06:38] <qiau> anyone noticed any problems with dialogs using jquery ui 1.8.24? (i.e. they are just some kind of full width div without any borders)
[10:06:51] <mg983> Hi guys!
[10:09:45] <mg983> I put this drag and drop demo togetherâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/4Yyd6/1/   If you drag an item from the left list to the right list it works great (grays out the left box and doesn't let you move it, you can't move the right side items either) -- the only problem occurs when you drag, for example Item 1 over to the top slot of the right hand side (1.) and then you are able to drop Item 2 over it and it replaces item 1â€¦. how can I have it so on
[10:09:46] <mg983> you have dropped an item on the right hand side you cannot drop another item to replace that ?
[10:12:59] <Cork> about:config
[10:13:00] <Cork> opps
[10:13:01] <toter> BillCriswell: I'm backâ€¦ So, I added the code you provided but the animation does not work. This is the page i'm working on: http://bit.ly/SFoNCz
[10:13:38] <toter> BillCriswell: Could you please take a look? I'm do not know what i'm doing wrong...
[10:19:06] <BillCriswell> toter: You would need to run that code onload.
[10:19:21] <BillCriswell> (If you plan on keeping it in the header)
[10:21:21] <Cork> onload won't help with load time
[10:21:26] <BillCriswell> $(function(){ /* Code that needs to run after the page is loaded. */ });
[10:21:30] <Cork> cause scripts in the header blocks rendering
[10:21:50] <BillCriswell> I was just trying to get him through the error.
[10:22:15] <Cork> $(function(){}) doesn't delay the parsing of the file
[10:22:26] <Cork> or the fetching of the script file
[10:22:49] <Cork> and that will block until you put it at the end of the body
[10:22:49] <toter> BillCriswell: I am so sorry for abusing your kindness, but could you provide the code for me to addâ€¦ No matter what I try, I just can't make it work
[10:23:23] <Cork> toter: try moving the script tags
[10:24:19] <Cork> BillCriswell, toter sorry mixed up the channels
[10:24:27] <Cork> that answer wasn't related to the question >_<'
[10:24:28] <BillCriswell> :)
[10:24:28] <Cork> sorry
[10:24:38] <BillCriswell> I was wondering what you were going on about haha.
[10:24:50] <Cork> i hate it when i switch channel and forget that i did it :/
[10:25:16] <tubbo> hey guys, having a bit of an issue
[10:25:19] <tubbo> with IE 8/9 and CORS
[10:25:29] <tubbo> i'm using CORS to async-load this HTML on the page
[10:25:35] <tubbo> but it's failing on IE 8 or 9
[10:25:58] <tubbo> what i want to know is should i pursue CORS on IE, or should i just deal with the clusterfuck that is transporting full HTML partials in JSONP and having to escape all over the place
[10:26:01] <BillCriswell> toter: I'd put <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script> before all the scripts before the </body> then put the code I gave you earlier: http://pastie.org/pastes/4903639/text after all the other scripts.
[10:26:24] <toter> BillCriswell: Thank you again. I'll try that
[10:26:30] <BillCriswell> toter: Groovy.
[10:29:09] <danzik17> tubbo:  you probably need to use the XDomainRequest transport if you're not already:  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[10:33:13] <tubbo> danzik17: yeah I've been reading about that, but that link wasn't working yesterday for some reason and I wasn't sure how it worked. so do I just need to drop that in my other code that executes?
[10:33:22] <tubbo> like have that in front of all my other code?
[10:33:36] <tubbo> or do i need that on the site that's requesting the ajax content?
[10:34:01] <danzik17> tubbo: as far as i know - i've never used CORS directly, but IE has their own implementation which is XDR
[10:34:02] <tubbo> it's basically a .js file that does all the work. on a DOM ready it replaces a <div> on the screen with the <form>
[10:34:07] <danzik17> put it on whatever site is making the requests
[10:34:10] <tubbo> ah ok
[10:34:10] <tubbo> thanks
[10:35:32] <Bonnie> A link i have added to the jqgrid title works when i initiate click from the console but not when clicked from the page itself, any ideas?
[10:39:27] <jarr0dsz> hmmz it really seems not that easy :(
[10:39:38] <jarr0dsz> anyone an idea how i could build something like the facebook im? where you have a list of friends
[10:39:45] <jarr0dsz> and each time you click them they expand to the left
[10:41:02] <jarr0dsz> something like so: http://pix.am/FgEe/
[10:41:19] <jarr0dsz> i have this example code in ember but its way to complicated to understand, what would be a good way of doing this with regular jquery?
[10:41:27] <jarr0dsz> the freinds list will be an expand collapsable div wich is easy
[10:41:29] <scar> is the only way to check if a color is selected upon form submission is thru jquery?
[10:41:53] <jarr0dsz> but how about every time you click a freind make a "tab" open to the left with a box above? i now have this jquery tabs setup wich does exactly the opposite
[10:42:09] <Cork> scar: "color" you mean from a select dropdown or what?
[10:46:43] <toter> BillCriswell: I'm afraid it did not work. I'll give up on this. This is way above my level. Thanks for everything...
[10:46:53] <scar> Cork: like a radio, http://ulg.alomedia.net/product/tying-the-knot/
[10:46:58] <jarr0dsz> think perhaps i need a container and add divs to it argh this is frustrating not knowing how to tackle the problem
[10:47:16] <scar> click a color choice-- i have it set to move upon selection, etc... but i cant apply the html5 "required" attribute to it.. i want a color selected hah
[10:47:25] <BillCriswell> toter: No reason to give up.
[10:47:27] <BillCriswell> Where's the link?
[10:47:30] <Cork> scar: so check the selected value in te submit event
[10:48:13] <scar> Cork: so i have to use jquery? lol i was hoping for a non jquery solution
[10:48:37] <Cork> scar: your asking in the wrong channel for a none jquery solution
[10:48:48] <scar> yeah i know haha
[10:48:53] <Cork> scar: but ya, you can do it without jquery; try ##javascript
[10:49:01] <scar> well, i meant w/o javascript
[10:49:09] <scar> oh well. all good ill just use jquery :)
[10:49:11] <toter> BillCriswell: http://bit.ly/SFoNCz
[10:49:20] <Cork> scar: how would you check something without scripting?
[10:49:38] <Cork> scar: if you don't want to use js, you need to let the server do it
[10:49:50] <tubbo> danzik17: do you happen to know why this isn't in $.ajax inherently?
[10:49:50] <BillCriswell> toter: You may need to reupload, seeing the same thing.
[10:50:16] <tubbo> i feel like it should be...like if you have crossDomain: true in your $.ajax call, it will change the transport from XHR->XDR if you're on IE..
[10:50:47] <danzik17> tubbo: not being on the core team, i can't give you an official answer.  if i had to guess, probably because it's specific to only a couple of browsers so it doesn't make sense to force everyone to pay the size cost.
[10:51:05] <Cork> tubbo: built in ajax doens't support XDomainRequest
[10:51:11] <Cork> tubbo: there is an issue for it
[10:51:20] <toter> BillCriswell: Adding <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script> to the top of the page breaks the scrollspy feature...
[10:51:29] <Cork> but as XDomainRequest has so many extra limitations, its hard to justify adding support for it
[10:51:53] <Cork> (you can't do posts for it unless you add special server code for ie browsers)
[10:52:47] <Cork> tubbo: most reliable solution until <ie10 dies is to use a proxy server and add the things as a sub path
[10:53:02] <Cork> cors is just not doable with ie
[10:53:11] <toter> BillCriswell: I guess it did not this timeâ€¦ I reuploaded itâ€¦ http://bit.ly/SFoNCz
[10:54:08] <tubbo> Cork: right, i understand that you still need HTTP Headers, but I feel like this is a big enough problem (and will continue to be) that jQuery needs to support it *somehow*
[10:54:39] <Cork> tubbo: you can't use http headers, xdomainrequest forcibly forbids www-form encodings
[10:55:15] <tubbo> Cork: no i mean to enable CORS in the first place, you still need the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header right?
[10:55:18] <Cork> so your server has to accept the plain/text encoding, and you need to implement all the parsing (with the risk of code injection) your self
[10:55:25] <Cork> tubbo: no
[10:55:29] <Cork> xdomainrequest doesn't care
[10:55:33] <tubbo> oh
[10:55:35] <tubbo> god dammit
[10:55:42] <tubbo> how does MS keep fucking up
[10:55:45] <tubbo> seriously
[10:55:54] <Cork> its solution is to make it incompatible with normal servers instead
[10:56:07] <snover> ie10 implements cors
[10:56:09] <Cork> thats why its xdomainrequest instead of xmlrequest
[10:56:11] <snover> i would not say that is â€œkeeps fucking upâ€
[10:56:22] <Cork> snover: thats why i said <ie10
[10:56:27] <jarr0dsz> does anyone know a jquery plugin that allow tabs to be created on the left or right side? so you can add them [ first ] [ second ] [ + ] clicking the + would add a tab before the [ first ]
[10:56:30] <snover> i was talking to tubbo
[10:56:32] <tubbo> snover: the fact that i had to spend time debugging this in IE at all means that they fucked up
[10:56:36] <tubbo> MS should know better
[10:56:48] <tubbo> than to implement CORS differently from *every*. *other*. *browser*.
[10:57:02] <Cork> ms loves to *** up standards, through they'r getting better
[10:58:36] <tubbo> so the fix is you have to google it and everyone who wants to use CORS at all needs to add 40 lines of code to their project
[10:58:39] <tubbo> great
[10:58:42] <tubbo> that's sustainable
[10:58:49] <BillCriswell> toter: http://pastie.org/pastes/4903813/text
[10:58:51] <snover> yeah, i guess rewriting their javascript engine so it was no longer slow, implementing svg, implementing woff, implementing html5 video and audio, implementing css3 colors, selectors, multi-bg, box-shadow, media queries, calc, border-radius, etc etc etc. is just ufcking it up
[10:59:00] <snover> what a bunch of jerks
[10:59:05] <BillCriswell> toter: That source should work without a problem.
[10:59:09] <snover> why canâ€™t they just implement all the specs
[10:59:17] <tubbo> snover: yeah, why can't they?
[10:59:17] <snover> including the ones that havenâ€™t been invented yet
[10:59:24] <tubbo> chrome can
[10:59:25] <tubbo> firefox can
[10:59:26] <tubbo> safari can
[10:59:27] <tubbo> opera can
[10:59:29] <tubbo> why can't IE?
[10:59:35] <tubbo> seems like one of these companies is fucking up
[10:59:36] <tubbo> to me
[11:00:00] <snover> itâ€™s almost like they have to weigh the needs of their corporate clients against the needs of the 3 people that canâ€™t write a proxy
[11:00:03] <toter> BillCriswell: I'm on it
[11:00:03] <tubbo> and IE's implementation of all of that shit isn't even that great
[11:00:26] <tubbo> snover: really? CORS isn't a need of their corp. client? interesting.
[11:00:58] <tubbo> i guess no one will ever need to grab resources from other domains on the internet
[11:01:01] <tubbo> that NEVER happens!
[11:01:11] <tubbo> only 3 people do it right?
[11:01:15] <tubbo> me and i guess Cork
[11:01:23] <tubbo> and bill gates
[11:01:45] <Gates> false
[11:02:13] <tubbo> i'm glad they implemented CSS3 along with the rest of the browsers, btw
[11:02:18] <Cork> tubbo: its very common for ppl to need to do that
[11:02:22] <BillCriswell> Damn.. that 2,800 images upload fast...
[11:02:26] <tubbo> lol
[11:02:40] <tubbo> exactly
[11:02:45] <Cork> tubbo: but the solution is to work around the limitations instead of trying to attack them with cors
[11:02:55] <Cork> or xdomainrequest
[11:03:16] <Cork> tubbo: ex loading a script from both domains and message send the data between the two scripts
[11:03:30] <Cork> then let the script loaded from the other domain do the ajax call "home"
[11:03:46] <Cork> theres other solutions too
[11:05:11] <tubbo> Cork: well what i did was include <script src="api.com/widget.js"></script> on the actual site. that JS file then makes GET requests to its own domain to get the HTML resources
[11:05:21] <tubbo> is that what you were talking about?
[11:05:34] <tubbo> note that i'm *not* GETting those HTML partials locally, they use fully-qualified URLs
[11:05:53] <Cork> tubbo: more or less yes
[11:06:01] <tubbo> so i guess to the browser it's still making the call to http://api.com/lead, rather than /lead
[11:06:03] <Cork> theres many ways to do the same thing
[11:06:16] <tubbo> Cork: that didn't work for me, but i think i know why
[11:06:33] <tubbo> the .js is loaded from api.com but lives on somesite.com
[11:06:48] <tubbo> and it performs async GET requests to http://api.com/whatever, not just /whatever
[11:06:59] <tubbo> Cork: it was my thinking that /whatever would resolve to http://somesite.com/whatever
[11:07:05] <tubbo> and not the http://api.com/whatever that i wanted
[11:07:07] <Cork> tubbo: you need to load it in its own dom
[11:07:09] <tubbo> is that not ture?
[11:07:13] <tubbo> s/ture/true
[11:07:18] <tubbo> Cork: ahh...like with an <iframe>
[11:07:24] <Cork> yes
[11:07:26] <mg983> Hey guys, how can I sort the right list after populating the list? http://jsfiddle.net/4Yyd6/3/
[11:07:40] <Cork> tubbo: and thats why you need the message sending
[11:09:55] <BillCriswell> I switched my IRC theme to light on dark. My badass points have tripled.
[11:15:39] <astropirate> BillCriswell, don't lie to your self
[11:15:55] <BillCriswell> Fine, doubled.
[11:16:07] <tubbo> Cork: makes sense to me. i'm operating off of constraints...the client i made this for wanted to be able to style the markup from the external site
[11:16:11] <tubbo> therefore i can't use an <iframe>
[11:16:20] <tubbo> but i will be insisting on <iframe> usage for compatibility's sake
[11:16:30] <tubbo> doesn't matter how it looks if 30% of the world can't see it ;)
[11:18:19] <Cork> tubbo: and they have to be able to style it though js??
[11:18:33] <Cork> that makes little sense
[11:19:01] <Cork> tubbo: just have them provide a css file with links to the images, and make your script add classes, and it should just work
[11:19:03] <s3b`> if I'm dynamically adding divs (divsub) to another div (divparent), is there a way to get all the divsub's of divparent into an array?
[11:19:25] <Cork> $(this).parent().children()
[11:19:52] <Cork> s3b`: or other ways, it depends on your structure
[11:20:10] <s3b`> hmm
[11:20:38] <s3b`> well each divsub has an id attribute, and when the parent div is "closed" i need to iterate through the sub's id's
[11:20:43] <Richhh> (using jQueryUI datepicker) how can i set the minDate of #date2 to the date value of #date1 + 1 day?
[11:21:46] <Richhh> #date1 and #date2 and both ids of <input type="date"> tags
[11:23:43] <m1lt0n> Hello, I have a question. Is it possible when binding $(window).upload to be able to tell what type of unload event happened (e.g. redirection, close tab/browser etc)?
[11:25:45] <bluesm> hi
[11:25:58] <bluesm> Why there is
[11:26:15] <bluesm> "$("div").each(function (i) " ?
[11:26:26] <bluesm> In first example.
[11:26:37] <bluesm> of  : http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:27:01] <bluesm> What is the purpose of "i" variable in this function ?
[11:27:12] <johnkpaul> bluesm: it is not used
[11:27:18] <johnkpaul> and not necessary
[11:27:27] <johnkpaul> it is the index of the element
[11:28:14] <bluesm> johnkpaul: so every function will receive "index" as first parameter, and "element" as second ?
[11:28:28] <johnkpaul> bluesm: every function passed to .each, yes
[11:28:51] <bluesm> johnkpaul: But we can get element also by "this" ?
[11:28:55] <bluesm> so ?
[11:29:00] <bluesm> yes?
[11:29:12] <jugstah> (e, i) = (event, index)
[11:29:24] <bluesm> >>
[11:29:30] <johnkpaul> bluesm: this will be the DOM element, yes
[11:29:59] <bluesm> johnkpaul: if this will be DOM element ? only ?
[11:30:14] <johnkpaul> bluesm: I don't underestand your question
[11:30:42] <bluesm> johnkpaul: What is the purpose of passing "element" parameter if i can Get it by "this" with "context" ?
[11:32:15] <johnkpaul> bluesm: your preference, I find it more explicit to use the parameter
[11:33:53] <bluesm> johnkpaul: Ok. (it's strange to have 2 ways of doing the same thing) - But why the pass (in example) "i" parameter for no purpopse.
[11:35:15] <bubu> my forms will sometimes (randomly) submit multiple times... any ideas why?
[11:35:43] <johnkpaul> bluesm: there are reasons to use the index variable, for example css odd even striping pre-css3 or something like that
[11:36:02] <hlve> bubu, people clicking the submit button more than once.
[11:36:17] <hlve> 'hm. this isn't loading fast nuff'. let me click it again.'
[11:36:44] <ajpiano> bluesm: sometimes people manipulate the scope of an iterator using $.proxy, or whatever, and then 'this'won't be the element anymore, in which case you have to use the reference passedin as an argument
[11:36:57] <Richhh> anyone? :[
[11:38:41] <bubu> hlve: no, that isnt it
[11:38:50] <Richhh> (using jQueryUI datepicker) how can i set the minDate of #date2 to the date value of #date1 + 1 day?
[11:38:50] <Richhh> #date1 and #date2 and both ids of <input type="date"> tags
[11:39:47] <Cork> Richhh: you can't
[11:40:07] <Cork> min/maxDate only takes static values
[11:40:18] <bluesm> ajpiano: Ok. But I still don't get what is the purpose of "i" ~  Â  Â  $("div").each(function (i)  in http://api.jquery.com/each/ - first example
[11:40:19] <Cork> you would need to run code to calculate the time to use
[11:40:41] <Richhh> run what code?
[11:41:39] <Cork> Richhh: extract the datestring from #date1
[11:42:03] <fusion27> Any of you guys ever use the jPlayer jQuery plugin?
[11:42:20] <fusion27> I'm having a helluva time figuring out how to translate their documentation in to my code
[11:42:21] <tubbo> fusion27: no but i've used its underlying technology, SoundManager 2..
[11:42:26] <Cork> Richhh: you could use a $('#date2').datepicker('options', 'minDate', new-min-date) every time date1 is changed though
[11:42:28] <tubbo> hah
[11:42:28] <fusion27> Ahh ok
[11:42:35] <tubbo> fusion27: search SO for examples on how to use it
[11:42:40] <tubbo> i bet you'll find a real code example
[11:42:48] <Cork> Richhh: but you can't statically set it to always have that limit
[11:43:01] <fusion27> tubbo: I hope you might be able to understand
[11:43:04] <Richhh> ok Cork
[11:43:16] <Richhh> will try now thx
[11:43:42] <fusion27> tubbo: I don't want to allow the user to hit the play button until the whole file is loaded in
[11:43:43] <fusion27> event.jPlayer.status.waitForLoad
[11:43:57] <fusion27> I think that's what I want, but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to implement
[11:45:59] <fusion27> tubbo: here's what I have now https://gist.github.com/3828949
[11:46:54] <fusion27> I'm not sure where event.jPlayer.status.waitForLoad fits in there
[11:47:04] <fusion27> or how it's wrapped around that
[11:48:27] <tubbo> fusion27: the *whole* file? SM2 prevents playback until enough of the file is buffered to stream effectively
[11:49:46] <fusion27> I think that's what I wantâ€¦ I'm throwing all sorts of errors on my Android device if I hit that play button before the whole file is loaded in
[11:49:55] <ajpiano> bluesm: sometimes you need to know the index of the element, it is what it is.
[11:51:13] <fusion27> tubbo: I'm also seeing $.jPlayer.event.progress which I suppose might work too
[11:51:48] <fusion27> My skull thickness appears to be preventing me from grasping syntax or something
[11:51:55] <awc737> does this look alright? $('#rebate-iframe').contents().find('table').attr('width','0');
[11:52:05] <tubbo> fusion27: well how are you trying to use that? i think it's exposing that part of the API as 'events': http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/#jPlayer-event-use
[11:52:06] <fusion27> Being less dumber might help too :D
[11:52:30] <fusion27> I'm not quite sure where it'd go
[11:52:41] <tubbo> so you haven't even tried this yet? :)
[11:53:02] <fusion27> I poured over their site hoping to find an example of itâ€¦ once I see it in action, I think I'll be fine
[11:53:42] <mg983> Hi guys, I am trying to get the right side of this jsfiddle to allow users to sort the elements in the right hand sideâ€¦ that is after they move elements from the left to the right sideâ€¦ can anyone give me a hand? http://jsfiddle.net/4Yyd6/6/
[11:54:30] <awc737> $('#rebate-iframe').contents().find('table').attr('width','0');
[11:54:35] <awc737> good syntax? not working...
[11:54:47] <tubbo> fusion27: http://beatport.com uses it..
[11:54:52] <tubbo> not sure if you'll be able to see *how*
[11:54:57] <mg983> change .attr('width','0') to .css('width','0');
[11:54:59] <tubbo> but it definitely works
[11:55:05] <mg983> awc737: that was for you
[11:55:09] <tubbo> fusion27: have you set it up as-is and seen if it does what you want?
[11:55:14] <alaing> hi I have the following. http://jsfiddle.net/Fyr6U/1/ that checks if user have their CAPS lock on. how do I check this onload?
[11:55:15] <Cork> awc737: you would have to say what your doing, and preferable show the code too
[11:55:29] <mg983> beatport lil matthew addell's site?
[11:55:29] <mg983> nice
[11:55:50] <mg983> *lol
[11:55:51] <Cork> awc737: cause zero width table doesn't really make sense, as browsers normally don't allow that
[11:55:52] <awc737> Cork, trying to change the following iframe element
[11:55:57] <zypher> Is there a way to get the current y location of the scrollbar of a window?
[11:56:02] <awc737> <table width="700px">
[11:56:04] <fusion27> tubbo: taking a look at beatport
[11:56:07] <mg983> awc737: I told ya how to it,
[11:56:21] <Cork> ?p @ awc737
[11:56:22] <bot-t> awc737, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:56:40] <Cork> awc737: and not just single tags
[11:56:48] <Cork> the structure is needed
[11:56:59] <alaing> anyone attending the jQuery UK Conf 2013?
[11:56:59] <awc737> Cork, its one line, literally
[11:57:02] <awc737> document ready, one line of code
[11:57:10] <awc737> mg983, not working... :/
[11:57:20] <mg983> awc737: sorry :\
[11:57:24] <Cork> awc737: uh.. your talking about the script line
[11:57:34] <Cork> i'm talking about the full structure, including the html
[11:57:44] <mg983> why are you using .contents?
[11:57:47] <Cork> the relations is needed to help you
[11:57:47] <mg983> get rid of that call
[11:57:50] <awc737> because its an in iframe
[11:57:52] <mg983> just use the .find off of the id element
[11:57:53] <mg983> oh
[11:57:54] <Cork> mg983: its needed to get through an iframe
[11:57:58] <mg983> sorry
[11:58:01] <mg983> didn't realize that
[11:58:02] <awc737> you can see the issue if you input a zip code http://stage.jw.cagehost.com/product-support/customer-service/rebates-and-incentives
[11:58:25] <awc737> the iframe is too wide. table width=700px, setting it to 0 makes it just flow.. not sure why? but it works for me
[11:58:28] <awc737> if i can change it to 0
[11:58:32] <bluesm> ajpiano: Yes. But they do not use it :)
[11:58:41] <fusion27> tubbo: can't seem to find anything useful on beatport
[11:58:44] <ajpiano> who is "they?"
[11:58:59] <bluesm> ajpiano: I think they should at least comment about it
[11:59:02] <Cork> awc737: first; check so the selector finds the element your looking for
[11:59:03] <ajpiano> who is they
[11:59:17] <Cork> awc737: when you've made sure the selector works, use removeAttr('width')
[11:59:17] <fusion27> tubbo: got this starting point here https://gist.github.com/3828949
[11:59:37] <awc737> Cork, whats the best way of checking the selector finds it?
[11:59:40] <Cork> awc737: the reason the other 0 works is cause its invalid so the browser ignores it
[11:59:40] <ajpiano> bluesm: fwiw, in an ideal world, the order of the arguments to jQuery.each and friends would be elem, index
[11:59:48] <ajpiano> this way the index could be omitted if people didn't need it
[11:59:51] <Cork> awc737: check the return array length
[12:00:06] <ajpiano> unfortunately jQuery was created before array.forEach was really "a thing", so to speak, and we can't go back and change the order of the arguments now
[12:00:10] <fusion27> tubbo:  do you know how I'd integrate that $.jPlayer.event.progress or event.jPlayer.status.waitForLoad with my starting point?
[12:00:14] <Cork> awc737:  alert($().contents().find().length)
[12:00:16] <ajpiano> because it would break backwards compat, etc
[12:00:20] <fusion27> I'd be forever grateful for your help :D
[12:01:02] <mg983> let's not breeze over my question too people :)
[12:01:27] <awc737> ok thanks
[12:01:32] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Clearly we just need to add $.e and $.fn.e with the arguments in the right order
[12:01:42] <Eviltwin> And fewer characters!
[12:01:48] <ajpiano> clearly we need toall drink bleach
[12:01:55] <alaing> hi I have the following. http://jsfiddle.net/Fyr6U/1/ that checks if user have their CAPS lock on. how do I check this onload?
[12:02:26] <alaing> I was thinking .trigger() but that doesn't seem to work
[12:02:45] <mg983> alaing: I don't know if you can without input fem the user
[12:02:45] <mg983> *from
[12:04:06] <awc737> damn, its returning 0
[12:04:09] <awc737> for a class I KNOW is in there
[12:04:24] <mg983> something is wrong then awc737
[12:04:46] <mg983> I am trying to get the right side of this jsfiddle to allow users to sort the elements in the right hand sideâ€¦ that is after they move elements from the left to the right sideâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/4Yyd6/6/
[12:04:48] <BillCriswell> I don't really care for the taste of bleach.
[12:05:28] <mg983> Bleach is eckk
[12:05:34] <mg983> gr0ss
[12:06:18] <fusion27> can anyone help a poor soul sort out some documentation?  I'm trying to use the jPlayer plugin and I want to disable the play button until the mp3 has completely loaded https://gist.github.com/3828949
[12:06:40] <alaing> mg983: so you cant simulate a keypress?
[12:06:48] <awc737> this is my only other line of code
[12:06:49] <awc737> jQuery('#rebate-iframe').load(function(){
[12:07:02] <fusion27> join #jplayer
[12:07:04] <jarr0dsz> anyone knows how to get jquery ui content appear *above* the tab instead of below?
[12:07:04] <mg983> alaing: don't think so, sounds like a security issue if you could
[12:07:47] <mg983> jarr0dsz: that's not very descriptive
[12:08:05] <jarr0dsz> you have the tab and below is the content i need it reversed
[12:08:06] <tubbo> you can simulate a click iirc
[12:08:14] <jarr0dsz> [ tab ]
[12:08:16] <tubbo> why wouldn't you be able to .trigger('keydown')?
[12:08:36] <mg983> tubbo: he's talking about from the keyboard to detect if the keyboard has caps lock on
[12:08:44] <tubbo> oh
[12:09:00] <tubbo> can you validate pw fields?
[12:09:11] <tubbo> lol maybe you could validate if the input text is all uppercase chars
[12:09:52] <tubbo> yeah you totally can
[12:10:24] <tubbo> alaing: just match the string over a regex for all uppercase characters, and display a message saying caps lock might be on
[12:12:20] <tubbo> if ($('#password').val().match(/^[A-Z]*$/) != null) { alert("Turn CAPS LOCK off"); }
[12:12:24] <mg983> He's not talking about "MIGHT" be on
[12:12:25] <scar> tubbo: what if you hit caps in the middle of typing...
[12:12:28] <mg983> he's talking about telling if it is on
[12:12:45] <tubbo> scar: this would be called onBlur
[12:12:45] <scar> surely there's a trigger('capslock') or something haha
[12:12:48] <tubbo> nope
[12:12:50] <tubbo> :)
[12:12:55] <awc737> mg983, Cork what could be wrong with this code? http://paste.laravel.com/76b
[12:12:59] <awc737> for this page: http://stage.jw.cagehost.com/product-support/customer-service/rebates-and-incentives
[12:13:18] <scar> tubbo: if you are  checking for ALL CAPS, what if you accidentally hit it while typing ?
[12:13:18] <mg983>  Sorry awc737 i've got a pressing issue I am looking for help on
[12:13:23] <mg983> when I figure it out I will be able to help
[12:13:32] <scar> he wants to notify 100% that its on heh
[12:13:34] <tubbo> scar: it's if the whole thing is caps
[12:14:13] <tubbo> awc737: well first of all, everything's on one line
[12:14:19] <tubbo> awc737: which is bad if you're trying to debug
[12:14:21] <alaing> brb
[12:14:51] <awc737> tubbo, what is on one line?
[12:14:55] <tubbo> awc737: secondly, i'm not sure what you're trying to do here at all. .load() is supposed to load ajax content from a URL, right?
[12:15:03] <awc737> .load is like .ready i thought
[12:15:05] <tubbo> awc737: //stage.jw.cagehost.com/product-support/customer-service/rebates-and-incentives
[12:15:08] <awc737> fire once the iframe loads
[12:15:08] <tubbo> bleh
[12:15:10] <tubbo> alert($("#rebate-iframe").contents().find("div").length);
[12:15:36] <tubbo> awc737: step through it. first see if $("#rebate-iframe").contents() is giving you back what you want..
[12:15:41] <tubbo> awc737: nope.
[12:16:04] <tubbo> ohh i see why you thought that http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:16:06] <tubbo> haha
[12:16:10] <tubbo> but that is deprecated..
[12:16:16] <awc737> so I should not use .load?
[12:16:22] <awc737> .ready seems to fire too early
[12:16:36] <NoiseEee> awc737: the element has rendered - its contents have not
[12:16:44] <NoiseEee> awc737: an iframe loads an entirely separate document
[12:17:01] <NoiseEee> that cannot be accessed by $('#iframeHolder .someClassInIframe')
[12:17:04] <tubbo> awc737: it's much cleaner to be doing this stuff inside the <iframe>, or a JS file that the <iframe> loads
[12:17:39] <awc737> i don't have access to the iframes code
[12:17:46] <awc737> is there a way to say on iframe'
[12:17:51] <awc737> iframe's document load?
[12:18:02] <NoiseEee> awc737: is the iframe on your same domain?
[12:18:08] <awc737> no
[12:18:17] <NoiseEee> awc737: so you don't get access to anything in the iframe, period.
[12:18:29] <awc737> except thru javascript...?
[12:18:34] <awc737> iframe.contents() ?
[12:18:35] <NoiseEee> nope.
[12:18:38] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[12:18:53] <Eviltwin> Although $(iframe).load(function() { ... }); might still work
[12:18:54] <subsume> I'm having trouble making jquery-mobile listview() work in my backbone view render() method. It doesn't change anything visually if I do it there. but then I must subsequently call listview('refresh') in the console to apply the styles
[12:18:59] <Eviltwin> should still work
[12:19:33] <awc737> NoiseEee, then whats all this about? http://api.jquery.com/contents/#example-1
[12:19:52] <awc737> believe it or not, i was actually doing this yesterday and had the table width adjusting to 0
[12:19:56] <awc737> but I messed up in Git and lost the code
[12:20:43] <tubbo> awc737: the URLs those <iframe>s point to are on the same domain, so no cross-domain issues there...
[12:21:01] <NoiseEee> awc737: that actually surprises me that contents() works like that, but the same origin policy is still the issue
[12:21:14] <NoiseEee> so try Eviltwin's suggestion
[12:21:24] <awc737> thats what i already have
[12:21:30] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/76b
[12:21:55] <tubbo> awc737: if you can, i would really recommend doing this stuff in the <iframe> itself. will save you tons of trouble.
[12:22:07] <awc737> tubbo, the urls are not the same... jeld-wen / greenohm.com
[12:22:15] <awc737> i don't have access to the iframe code
[12:22:31] <tubbo> awc737: looks like you're SOL :(
[12:22:52] <awc737> thats not true tubbo , http://api.jquery.com/contents/#example-1
[12:23:01] <noregret> is there any callback in $.get/$.getJSON that runs before sending the ajax request ?
[12:23:14] <tubbo> awc737: so?
[12:23:35] <awc737> tubbo, are you serious?
[12:23:42] <NoiseEee> awc737: that example works because the domains are the SAME
[12:23:56] <awc737> i had this working yesterday
[12:23:58] <Richhh> (here seems to be my answer) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2484631/jquery-datepicker-mindate-variable
[12:24:12] <awc737> how do I undo a git reset --hard
[12:24:27] <mg983> hehehehehe
[12:24:31] <mg983> good question there
[12:24:56] <mg983> http://devjosh.com/undoing-git-reset-stack-overflow
[12:25:01] <NoiseEee> awc737: pretty sure that's unrecoverable, you can ask in #git though
[12:25:11] <noregret> awc737: press CTRL-Z
[12:25:27] <awc737> lol
[12:25:36] <tubbo> lol
[12:25:39] <tubbo> awc737: it's recoverable
[12:25:57] <tubbo> NoiseEee: *nothing* is unrecoverable in Git unless an E-bomb goes off
[12:26:10] <tubbo> and then you may have bigger fish to fry than the contents of your git repo
[12:26:21] <NoiseEee> tubbo: im pretty sure ^^ that is totally unrecoverable
[12:26:26] <mg983> Can anyone help â€¦ ? go here and move the elements from the left to the right, now, how can I reorder the elements on the left side (i.e. move the elements but not the actual numbers)  http://jsfiddle.net/4Yyd6/6/
[12:26:31] <NoiseEee> same as git checkout -- /stuffOops
[12:28:18] <kentaromiura> hey, guys, can't you tell me if in the plugin I just linked here (https://twitter.com/kentaromiura/status/253573156768456704) I made some mistakes that I'm unaware of, since is my first one?
[12:28:37] <awc737> surely there is a way to listen to an iframe, and if it gets longer, make your page longer?
[12:28:48] <fearphage> i have set of elements $foo and i want to find the last element in this set that matches a selector. is that not what index('.selector') is for?
[12:29:05] <mg983> :last-child
[12:29:08] <toter> BillCriswell: It's me againâ€¦ I'm sorry, it's still not working. Do you think it's something related to CSS? Or something fundamentally wrong with bootstrap?
[12:29:10] <fearphage> '.selector:last'
[12:29:13] <snover> awc737: depends on whether you are cross-domain or not
[12:29:14] <mg983> or that
[12:29:23] <fearphage> mg983: slightly different
[12:29:28] <awc737> yes snover cross domain
[12:29:40] <mg983> awc737: maybe you can try a flash hack, but that's what it is a hack
[12:29:42] <snover> then, nope, not without modifying the host page
[12:29:47] <snover> er
[12:29:48] <snover> child page
[12:29:53] <toter> BillCriswell: Sorry for insistingâ€¦ I would just love to see it workingâ€¦ And maybe it's not something terribly difficult
[12:29:54] <awc737> really? it's that hard to listen to an iframe container height?
[12:30:01] <NoiseEee> awc737: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[12:30:03] <awc737> shouldn't I Only need the container's height?
[12:30:07] <awc737> on my site
[12:31:02] <codegoat> Using 1.8.2 and having issues with ajaxComplete.  The function (e, xhr, settings) is handed each of those arguments, but they are all empty objects.
[12:31:16] <codegoat> *callback function
[12:31:28] <subsume> http://dpaste.com/809520/ can anyone see why my listview() might not be being applied?
[12:31:57] <awc737> ?
[12:33:11] <BillCriswell> toter: There has to be something wrong in your other code.
[12:33:38] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/XuHDK/embedded/result/ works fine, though it's not styled
[12:33:47] <toter> It's the CSS then
[12:34:20] <BillCriswell> Link to CSS file?
[12:34:51] <fearphage> is this a bug in jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/mBVpc/2/
[12:35:15] <toter> BillCriswell: There are two css files in the projectâ€¦ bootstrap-cerulean.css and bootstrap-responsive.css
[12:35:37] <BillCriswell> Sweet. You can try validating the CSS and see if there's any errors.
[12:35:40] <toter> I did not change the code, they come from the bootstrap framework
[12:36:19] <BillCriswell> toter: If you link to it I might be able to spot it.
[12:37:27] <toter> First: http://hcm.com.br/bootstrap/site/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-cerulean.css
[12:37:35] <toter> second: http://hcm.com.br/bootstrap/site/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-responsive.css
[12:38:03] <TheHappyPeanut> Does anyone here have experience with uniform.js?
[12:38:29] <bluesm> Hey.
[12:38:42] <TheHappyPeanut> Hi
[12:39:13] <bluesm> If I .each something. (array of $('.someclass'))
[12:39:54] <bluesm> Could I get the "jQuery" parametr in the second parametr ?
[12:40:24] <bluesm> Not plain "HTMLDivElement" but jQuery element? With all methods ?
[12:40:35] <ajpiano> fearphage: i think that the thing that doesn't work is right
[12:40:56] <ajpiano> fearphage:  oh wait, i didn't scroll down
[12:41:22] <BillCriswell> toter: There's a lot of \9 in that source in odd places...
[12:41:38] <ajpiano> fearphage: the positional selectors are generally odd ducks, especially when you try to use them in filtering operations
[12:41:52] <BillCriswell> toter: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fhcm.com.br%2Fbootstrap%2Fsite%2Fbootstrap%2Fcss%2Fbootstrap-cerulean.css&profile=css3&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en
[12:42:10] <BillCriswell> You should try redownloading bootstrap... Think you may have got one that's kind of fucked.
[12:43:09] <bluesm> I can convert it with "$" yep?
[12:43:12] <BillCriswell> What is "cerulean" exactly?
[12:43:27] <ajpiano> a shade of blue
[12:43:38] <BillCriswell> Oh. SHould have googled that shit.
[12:43:39] <toter> BillCriswell: Wowâ€¦ so many errorsâ€¦ Those files were downloaded from http://bootswatch.com/. The template i'm using is called Cerulean
[12:44:19] <BillCriswell> toter: You should definitely find another one. Errors aren't the end of the world but some of those are very serious.
[12:44:35] <tomasm-> is it possible to add a mousedown handler on an image that is not the top z-index layer? I have several overlaid images (some partially transparent) and i'm trying to only allow a mousedown/click on a particular one, but there being an image on top (tho transparent partially) is catching it instead
[12:44:47] <awc737> u downloaded bootstrap-fucked edition?
[12:45:27] <bluesm> What is the best way. In jQuery. To change width (or hight) with delay ?
[12:45:35] <someprimetime> bootstrap -- making the web homogenized one shitty template at a time
[12:48:19] <BillCriswell> toter: http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/bootstrap.css is definitely busted up, but http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css looks cool.
[12:48:42] <awc737> lol, and bootstrap isnt even convenient in my opinion
[12:49:03] <awc737> i can define a grid, button classes, etc, much more conveniently
[12:49:26] <awc737> Zurb Foundation's modal, and extra features work much better than bootstrap anyway
[12:49:29] <awc737> so start there if you have to
[12:49:34] <toter> BillCriswell: Niceâ€¦ Let me change it and test it
[12:49:56] <BillCriswell> Actually... I have no idea what's going on cause http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/bootstrap.css is actually working fine.
[12:49:59] <BillCriswell> You can ignore me haha.
[12:50:45] <BillCriswell> toter: http://jsfiddle.net/XuHDK/2/
[12:50:56] <BillCriswell> I still don't trust that shit.
[12:51:27] <Richhh> why does $('#date').val(today); work but not $('#date').min(today);  ???
[12:51:43] <toter> BillCriswell: Wowâ€¦ it's workingâ€¦ Let me run some tests and try to understand what you did
[12:51:59] <Richhh> #date is a date tag
[12:52:03] <Richhh> element*
[12:52:25] <Richhh> input element with date attribute*
[12:52:36] <Richhh> type=date***
[12:53:52] <Richhh> using Chrome 22
[12:53:55] <BillCriswell> Richhh: What is today?
[12:54:04] <Richhh> var today = now.getFullYear() + '-' + month + '-' + day;
[12:54:26] <Richhh> var now = new Date();     var month = (now.getMonth() + 1);         var day = now.getDate();
[12:54:36] <Richhh> suffice to say it is in the correct format i believe
[12:55:05] <Richhh> var now = new Date();
[12:55:36] <Richhh> obv code is in the correct order
[12:56:46] <shoky> Richhh: there is no .min(..) method in jquery
[12:56:59] <shoky> Richhh: i think you want $('#date').prop('min', today)
[12:57:08] <Richhh> sry my bad
[12:57:11] <Richhh> ty
[12:58:04] <Richhh> works
[12:58:34] <toter> BillCriswell: Unbelievableâ€¦ Let me ask youâ€¦ Why does it work on jsfiddle but when I copy the content of the link you provided, save it to a .html file and run... it doesn't work?
[12:58:59] <fearphage> ajpiano: is there an alternative solution?
[12:59:25] <bluesm> What can I delay with "delay" function ?
[12:59:30] <ajpiano> fearphage: yeah, there is, i can cook one up. just wasn't sure if you had found one and were reporting the bug
[12:59:33] <bluesm> Not everthing ?
[12:59:40] <ajpiano> fearphage: can you describe what you're actually trying to get?
[13:00:03] <fearphage> i want the last element in the jquery set that matches a selector
[13:00:08] <BillCriswell> toter: I'm not sure. Could be a bunch of weird things.
[13:00:32] <ajpiano> fearphage: see ?last
[13:00:33] <shoky> bluesm: not everything, only stuff that's on jquery's queues, like animations. you can queue stuff yourself with .queue(...)
[13:00:33] <bot-t> fearphage, .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[13:01:03] <shoky> bluesm: on the other hand, setTimeout can delay _everything_
[13:01:07] <bluesm> shoky: For normal stuff I have to use setTimeout?
[13:01:09] <fearphage> last takes a selector i assume
[13:01:10] <fearphage> let me see
[13:01:16] <shoky> bluesm: yes
[13:01:17] <bluesm> shoky: Ok :)
[13:01:29] <ajpiano> fearphage: it just gives you whatever is last in the given set
[13:01:48] <ajpiano> .filter(".foo:last") might be what you want
[13:01:54] <toter> BillCriswell: Just the fact that I saw the animation working on that link you providedâ€¦ It is enough for me. Thank you again.
[13:02:38] <ajpiano> fearphage: .index is for getting the actual numerical index of an element in a set - it sounds like you actually want an element at the end so you need  a filtering operation
[13:03:21] <mg983> Can someone give me a hand here - http://jsfiddle.net/matstars/Bn2JX/ after dragging elements from the left to the right I want to be able to reorder the right listâ€¦. everything else is working as expected. Thanks!
[13:04:03] <BillCriswell> toter: Just ran the HTML through an HTML validator. There is something a bit weird with it. Definitely run it through an HTML validator haha.
[13:05:29] <hip2p> I have an html submit button with id='show_pass' with text 'show pass'. in jquery I have $('#show_pass').val('hide pass'); Shouldn't this change the text of the button to 'hide pass'?
[13:05:32] <toter> BillCriswell: Thanks manâ€¦ I'll check that as well
[13:05:38] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:06:59] <hip2p> Figured it out: I had to use .html and not .val
[13:07:08] <fearphage> ajpiano: i want the index of the oppsite of :first... which seems functional
[13:07:33] <ajpiano> ah
[13:08:05] <ajpiano> var things = $(".things"), last = things.last()[0], index = things.index( last ); will do the trick
[13:09:14] <fearphage> ajpiano: <a class="foo bar"/> // $stuff = $('.foo'); $stuff.index($stuff.last('.bar')[0]) fails
[13:09:41] <fearphage> ajpiano: all the things in the set aren't the same. i want to find the last one that matches a selector
[13:10:04] <ajpiano> fearphage: do you actually care what its positional index is, or do you just want the element itself
[13:10:17] <ajpiano> .filter("whatever").last() will surely work
[13:10:51] <ajpiano> (in that cast)
[13:11:10] <Eviltwin> caste*
[13:11:47] <ajpiano> lol
[13:11:54] <fearphage> ajpiano: i care about the index. let me step back. i need to find the current element that is selected OR the last element with a sepecific class
[13:12:21] <fearphage> i'm using Math.max($foo.index(this), $foo.index(....))
[13:13:59] <fearphage> i'm also using slice
[13:15:48] <shoky> $foo.index( $foo.filter('.whatever').last()[0] )    ?
[13:16:04] <ajpiano> that's what i suggested but he said it was failing
[13:16:16] <shoky> he said .last('.bar')[0] fails
[13:16:26] <shoky> is it the same?
[13:16:35] <ajpiano> i'm also doing like eleventy billion things right now
[13:16:45] <ajpiano> oh yea
[13:16:49] <ajpiano> .last() doesn't take a selector, fearphage
[13:16:54] <ajpiano> it's just... give me the last element
[13:17:32] <ziz> Hey guys, I've been using jQuery infinite slider on a few sites and they all show a right hand side gap when viewing on mobile and I can't find out what it is, is this a common issue?
[13:17:54] <ziz> http://dev.six5webdesign.com/ when I disable it, it looks fine in mobile view
[13:18:14] <bluesm> Can i slow down
[13:18:17] <bluesm> .each ?
[13:20:18] <BillCriswell> bluesm: It sounds like you're trying to do ajax calls?
[13:20:37] <sohmestra> is there any way to get a handle on the list created by the jquery ui.autocomplete?
[13:20:58] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Actually not.
[13:21:20] <bluesm> BillCriswell: I want to change width of "each" element but with delay.
[13:21:29] <fearphage> ajpiano: wouldn't .filter('.selected:last') be just as effective?
[13:21:45] <sohmestra> I'd like to center the options dropdown on the currently selected item (assuming a value is currently selected)
[13:22:11] <ajpiano> fearphage: ostensibly
[13:22:38] <ajpiano> except that it is subject to some of the peculiarities of positional selectors
[13:22:38] <sohmestra> let me backup: I'm working on a combobox based on the one shown in the jquery ui exmples for autocomplete
[13:23:03] <sohmestra> so, the search results are based on the options in a select list.
[13:23:55] <sohmestra> when the dropdown button  is clicked, all items are shown for selection (by searching for "")
[13:23:56] <jugstah> the new IT guy is a wanker.. he can't multi-task worth a crap.
[13:24:31] <sohmestra> I'd like to scroll that div so that the currently selected item is in the middle of the list
[13:24:43] <sohmestra> so that it mimics current native dropdown behavior
[13:25:06] <sohmestra> but I can't figure out how to get a handle on the list created by ui.autocomplete()
[13:25:17] <sohmestra> any ideas?
[13:26:25] <fearphage> ajpiano: this is the abomination I've had to construct https://gist.github.com/38b00ec0c3891815c477 :)
[13:26:49] <ajpiano> yikes
[13:28:28] * jugstah suffers a nosebleed on that URL.
[13:28:48] <BillCriswell> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/1/ might help.
[13:29:00] <fearphage> lol
[13:29:19] <ajpiano> fearphage: i think i figured out why it's failing
[13:29:21] <bluesm> BillCriswell:WoW!
[13:29:25] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Thank you very much!
[13:29:31] <fearphage> ajpiano: did you file a bug?
[13:29:37] <BillCriswell> bluesm: No problem!
[13:29:42] <ajpiano> it isn't, strictly speaking, a bug
[13:29:52] <ajpiano> or at least, it's something i'd defer to dave, etc on
[13:30:19] <ajpiano> fearphage: what's going on is, $active.index("img:last") is the same as $("img:last").index( $active[0] )
[13:30:31] <ajpiano> since the last image on the page doesn't have the active class
[13:30:47] <fearphage> ajpiano: if :first works, :last should. either both should fail or both should work in my opinion
[13:30:49] <ajpiano> it returns -1
[13:30:52] <fearphage> ahh i see
[13:31:04] <ajpiano> fearphage: i think that it's a quirk of the exact html you happen to be using
[13:31:13] <ajpiano> if the very first image on the page weren't active, i think we'd see it happening on both ends
[13:31:14] <toter> BillCriswell: The page runs on jsfiddle just fineâ€¦ But when I run it locally, it does not workâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/5SGG9/ Do you think I have to add something to the <body> tag?
[13:31:21] <fearphage> i see what you mean
[13:31:30] <fearphage> it sounds like a documentation shortcoming more than a bug
[13:31:50] <gnarf> fearphage: positional selectors are a pain
[13:32:03] <gnarf> would you mind recapping the issue
[13:32:05] <gnarf> ?
[13:32:33] <BillCriswell> toter: The error I get what I validate that HTML freaks me out. It's saying "non-space charactr in page trailer".
[13:33:00] <BillCriswell> toter: Make sure you're saving in UTF-8.
[13:34:22] <toter> BillCriswell: on the top of the page, there is this: <meta charset="utf-8">
[13:34:22] <BillCriswell> toter: There's some kind of weird space after the </html> tag. Get rid of it.
[13:34:33] <docmur> I'm trying to get a dialog box from jQuery UI to close after a call to a PHP file the code I'm using is: http://pastebin.com/G5B6iVjE  Now if you press cancel the dialog closes, but when you press Add it wont close.  Bascially Add goes to a php script, does some database work and returns.  I'm I doing something clearly wrong
[13:34:51] <anew> in console when you have xhr finished loading, how do u see what div modification called the xhr request ?
[13:35:04] <BillCriswell> toter: Make sure you're saving your files as utf-8. I think that's what's causing the issue?
[13:35:31] <toter> BillCriswell: Interestingâ€¦ Let me check that
[13:36:19] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Can I anyhow, set something after the animation ?
[13:37:01] <BillCriswell> bluesm: Yes. there's a complete callback.
[13:37:02] <begginerjquery> help
[13:37:47] <begginerjquery> who can help me?
[13:37:49] <toter> BillCriswell: I'm pasting the code to validateâ€¦ and it's still complaining about utf-8
[13:37:52] <gnarf> ?ask @begginerjquery
[13:37:53] <bot-t> begginerjquery, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:38:05] <bluesm>  BillCriswell: How can I do that ? You know, after the all animation end...
[13:38:14] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys, I was just curious: Is there any resource that explains jQuery's data system (how it stores it, when is it garbage collected, etc.) ?
[13:38:31] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: my head?
[13:38:32] <gnarf> :)
[13:38:35] <bluesm> new delay ?
[13:38:42] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: there might be one somewhere, but I know the answers you seek
[13:38:49] <begginerjquery> I have this message .validate is not a function
[13:38:57] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: what version of jQuery?
[13:39:14] <rodyhaddad> gnarf, haha :D
[13:39:23] <rodyhaddad> gnarf, 1.8.2 (newest)
[13:39:29] <BillCriswell> bluesm: You want a delay after the animation immediately or you want more of a delay?
[13:39:30] <begginerjquery> jquery-1.7.2
[13:39:50] <BillCriswell> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/2/ if you want it after the animation is complete
[13:40:03] <anew> any easy way to read minified jq ?
[13:40:07] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: .data() is stored on jQuery.cache and uses a few "generated" variables to store itself
[13:40:27] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: part 1: each element that has data is given a "uuid"
[13:41:00] <NoiseEee> anew: load the non-minified version! :)  or visit a js beautifier site
[13:41:08] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: that uuid is stored on an attribute named "jQuery" + Date.getTime() + some other random stuff of the dom element
[13:41:29] <anew> noiseeee yeah i mean after that part :)
[13:41:30] <rodyhaddad> gnarf, ok (yea, I already saw that attribute before)
[13:41:43] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: the attrib name is "jQuery.expando"
[13:42:09] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: so, inside that cache is a "private" data object (where jQuery stores events, other private data)
[13:42:23] <gnarf> and inside the private data object is an object called "data" that stores the data you store
[13:42:31] <rodyhaddad> ok
[13:42:34] <fearphage> gnarf: i have a list of 5k elements ($elements). some of them have a class name  I care about (.catpants). I need to see if the user's currently selected element OR the last .catpants element has the highest index
[13:42:42] <gnarf> rodyhaddad: it gets "cleaned" whenever you .remove() elements
[13:42:48] <rodyhaddad> and does it ever get garbage collected somehow?
[13:42:53] <docmur> got it
[13:42:54] <gnarf> it looks for elements that have expandos, and removes them
[13:42:54] <rodyhaddad> ah, ok
[13:43:00] <fearphage> gnarf: 5k is jsut a sample. i'm trying to be as efficient as possible her because the user is waiting for feedback
[13:43:18] <Richhh> my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/
[13:43:30] <BillCriswell> bluesm: If you want to wait till after the animation is done, then wait a certain amount of time you could use delay inside the callback.
[13:43:32] <rodyhaddad> is there a way to just remove the data (that I set), because .remove() also removes events :/
[13:43:58] <gnarf> fearphage: so, selected i assume is a class?
[13:44:14] <gnarf> why not just $elements.last().is( ".catpants,.selected" )
[13:44:29] <begginerjquery> .validate is not a function?
[13:44:29] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Mhm.
[13:44:30] <fearphage> gnarf: select is `this`
[13:44:31] <begginerjquery> jquery-1.7.2
[13:44:38] <gnarf> fearphage: okay
[13:44:41] <BillCriswell> toter: Complaining about UTF-8 is ok. You just don't want that weird space error.
[13:44:55] <NoiseEee> begginerjquery: correct, there is no .validate function in jquery
[13:45:01] <gnarf> fearphage: var last = $elements.last(); return last[0] == this || last.is(".catpants"); ?
[13:45:15] <Bonnie> how do i set up the datepicker so that when I select the date as 10/4/2012, the time is 10/4/2012 11:59 pm?
[13:45:20] <begginerjquery> NoiseEee I have the class with this func...
[13:45:32] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/1/
[13:45:41] <gnarf> begginerjquery: you need to include the validate plugin if you want validate
[13:45:43] <gnarf> ?validate
[13:45:47] <bot-t> gnarf, Plugins/Validation - jQuery Wiki - This documentation is moving to a new home http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[13:45:59] <fearphage> gnarf: that assumes i care about the last element in the list. did you see this? https://gist.github.com/38b00ec0c3891815c477
[13:46:28] <fearphage> gnarf: i care about 0 through (this/.catpants:last) elements
[13:46:30] <bakers> If I want to read a users google login credentials, how do I do that?
[13:46:46] <gnarf> fearphage: ahh, so you want the index of this, or the last catpants
[13:46:50] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/2/
[13:46:53] <gnarf> in $elements
[13:46:54] <danheberden> bakers, stand awkwardly behind them as they type them in
[13:46:58] <bakers> I want to allow a user to login to my site using their gmail login
[13:47:20] <begginerjquery> I have this gnarf...
[13:47:22] <BillCriswell> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/3/ This what you're looking for?
[13:47:43] <danheberden> bakers: https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/articles/authentication
[13:47:51] <citric3> I have a <div id="statusSuccess">Message</div> in a successful response. I tried to do jQuery(response).find("#statusSuccess"), but the result is length == 0. What am I doing wrong?
[13:47:53] <danheberden> hmm, that might be too specific
[13:48:29] <citric3> If I do .find("div") the length == 1
[13:48:40] <gnarf> fearphage: seems to be a very strange use case here :)
[13:48:45] <anew> || in jq is OR also right
[13:48:53] <gnarf> ?jsisjs
[13:48:54] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[13:48:55] <bluesm>  BillCriswell: To be honest.
[13:48:56] <toter> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/5SGG9/embedded/result/. I copy the code and save it to a .html file. it does not work. I don't get it. Why it works beautifully on jsfiddle and it does not work locally?
[13:48:58] <danheberden> bakers: http://openid.net/add-openid/add-getting-started/
[13:49:03] <bluesm>  BillCriswell:  I want to make the wave. :)
[13:49:06] <fearphage> gnarf: most definitely
[13:49:08] <toter> I'm completely baffled by this
[13:49:35] <BillCriswell> toter: Did you resave the file with utf-8 encoding?
[13:49:46] <gnarf> fearphage: so if they select something beyond the last catpants, you want it to go up until the selected, otherwise up until the last catpants?
[13:50:37] <bluesm> BillCriswell: I have it
[13:50:40] <BillCriswell> Also, make sure you remove ALL characters after </html>
[13:51:12] <BillCriswell> There's hidden ones in there, most likely a BOM.
[13:51:23] <toter> BillCriswell: I'm using Espresso, an html editor for the Mac. It doesn't give me the option to save it with utf-8 encoding
[13:51:25] <gnarf> fearphage: are the $elements siblings ?
[13:51:36] <gnarf> like in the dom, or is it just some set in mem
[13:53:35] <toter> BillCriswell: Thank you for your patience and help. I need to go. But I'll come back some other time...
[13:54:03] <bluesm> http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/4/
[13:54:06] <BillCriswell> Jeesus.
[13:54:33] <bluesm> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/4/  - But then I have to trigger again this two animations after all ends.
[13:55:55] <bluesm> BillCriswell:How can I call again when "jquery delays" ends?
[13:56:39] <anew> || = OR
[13:56:39] <anew> ?
[13:56:52] <daslicious> yes
[13:57:03] <zoned> if i have a select element cached, what's the easiest way to remove its first <option>?
[13:57:05] <daslicious> lowercase
[13:57:06] <anew> g.ui = g.ui || {};
[13:57:13] <anew> so i dont understand what that is then
[13:57:22] <anew> it equals itself or an array ?
[13:57:54] <BillCriswell> bluesm: You can call it when the animate ends: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/5/
[13:59:02] <anew> a = a || {};
[13:59:08] <anew> means?
[13:59:50] <zoned> that a = whatever a was if it was previously defined, or || it not = a blank new object {}
[13:59:58] <bluesm> BillCriswell: But it is after every one of them ends..
[13:59:59] <danheberden> anew http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation
[14:00:03] <zoned> if not*
[14:00:20] <anew> ah thx zoned
[14:00:57] <zoned> its essentially a weak namespacing technique
[14:01:18] <anew> why weak
[14:01:22] <danheberden> how is that namespacing?
[14:01:25] <anew> better to just say a = {};
[14:01:25] <anew> ?
[14:01:29] <BillCriswell> bluesm: Not sure I'm following right.
[14:01:31] <danheberden> it's a weak typing technique
[14:01:32] <scar> lightbox is grouped such as rel="lightbox[group]" -- is there a way to link to ALL groups loaded?
[14:01:49] <danheberden> anew, i linked to what it is
[14:02:06] <danheberden> it's easier, sometimes, than saying if ( !a ) { a = {}; }
[14:02:33] <anew> i c
[14:02:33] <danheberden> such as, say, a function where you require an argument to be an object
[14:03:08] <BillCriswell> I hate working.
[14:03:11] <zoned> ^^
[14:03:21] <anew> so difference between {} and [] ?
[14:03:23] <anew> both arrays ?
[14:04:18] <BillCriswell> bluesm: Just keep in mind that animations happen asynchronously.
[14:04:18] <Bonnie>  Datepicker help requested: How do i set up the datepicker options so that when I select the date as 10/4/2012, the time is 10/4/2012 11:59 pm instead of the default 00:00?
[14:04:21] <nFFF> no, ones an object, ones an array
[14:04:32] <BillCriswell> bluesm: Doubt I even came close to spelling that right, but yeah.
[14:04:49] <bluesm> :)
[14:04:56] <anew> ah right
[14:04:56] <anew> k
[14:04:57] <anew> thx
[14:05:04] <someprimetime> anew: {} is an object and you can nest propertiesâ€¦ [] is an array and you can push values to it. both are objects though
[14:05:11] <danheberden> anew, http://jqfundamentals.com
[14:05:15] <bluesm> BillCriswell: I just want to get call on last animation.
[14:05:39] <BillCriswell> bluesm: After it's done... right?
[14:05:41] <danheberden> might be worth learning javascript before asking everyone specific questions
[14:05:48] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Right.
[14:05:53] <anew> lol
[14:05:59] <nFFF> anew, arrays are for numeric indexes, whereas objects you'd use for non numeric keys
[14:06:14] <zoned> if i have a select element cached, what's the easiest way to remove its first <option>?
[14:06:29] <BillCriswell> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/6/
[14:06:35] <anew> thx nfff
[14:06:43] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/3/  anyone ???
[14:07:44] <bluesm> BillCriswell: "whee" 10 times not one... at the end of the end.
[14:07:54] <danheberden> zoned - $( yourSelectElement.options[0] ).remove()
[14:08:28] <danheberden> assuming yourSelectElement is a DOM node
[14:08:53] <danheberden> otherwise, $yourSelectElement.children().eq(0).remove()
[14:09:15] <zoned> i've got the select element as a jquery object already
[14:09:17] <danheberden> or one of the other million ways to get the first element
[14:09:29] <zoned> ahh children would work.
[14:11:27] <bluesm> BillCriswell: I want this effect in loop.
[14:11:32] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Simply in loop...
[14:12:00] <BillCriswell> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/fKuHS/7/ ?!
[14:12:25] <ajpiano> bluesm: the problem is that you don't want an .each like that
[14:12:31] <ajpiano> you want one's completion to triger the next starting

[14:13:34] <anew> and how do u create ur own namespace if u dont want to use the $
[14:14:10] <Che-Anarc> Is there anyway of using FileReader with jplayer to dynamicaly create new instances using local user files? or would I encounter 404 cause it tryies to refences the asset as URI on server /path.
[14:14:33] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: He pointed someone to this article yesterday and I totally forgot about it already.
[14:15:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://stackoverflow.com/q/5230333/91914 -- <3 this option
[14:15:38] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I still think this is the best solution: http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/
[14:16:28] <gnarf> Eviltwin: thats a good one
[14:16:35] <gnarf> Eviltwin: I kinda hate the IIFE there
[14:16:44] <ajpiano> yea i like that one a lot Eviltwin
[14:16:55] <gnarf> even tho its more typing Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/2/ seems to make it look better :)
[14:16:55] <Eviltwin> You can also extend it slightly to add a callback: http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/1/
[14:17:36] <Eviltwin> It's based on the last one in paul_irish's list
[14:17:40] <Eviltwin> But simplified
[14:18:07] <bluesm> ajpiano:  Thanks ...
[14:18:51] <bluesm> BillCriswell: Thank you very much :)
[14:19:16] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: Would your way work with what bluesm was trying to do? It seems it counts on that eq(0) which would select the same one over and over again, right?
[14:19:21] <BillCriswell> bluesm: No problem.
[14:19:45] <BillCriswell> I could just be thinking about it the wrong way. It is getting kind of late. =(
[14:20:10] <bluesm> BillCriswell: You ?
[14:20:23] <bluesm> Ok i will read http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[14:20:29] <BillCriswell> bluesm: I don't know what you mean haha.
[14:20:46] <phishy> Anyone know any clever ways to make Webkit inspector show the userland code when you want to see event listeners?
[14:20:54] <phishy> on an HTML element
[14:21:03] <tubbo> phishy: "the userland code"?
[14:21:28] <phishy> tubbo: Yeah it shows the lines in jQuery core that bound the event.. I'd like to see the code that I right that did it
[14:21:35] <phishy> wrote*
[14:21:41] <phishy> stupid auto-correct
[14:21:58] <bluesm> have good night :)
[14:22:00] <bluesm> Bye.!
[14:22:04] <BillCriswell> Night.
[14:22:09] <tubbo> phishy: oh. i guess you're getting an error and trying to debug?
[14:22:26] <phishy> tubbo: When inspecting an element, I'd like to see if it has magic associated with it
[14:22:36] <phishy> tubbo: like bound event listeners etc
[14:22:50] <tubbo> phishy: ah. i think there's a jQuery plugin for Firebug but honestly i never found it very useful
[14:23:06] <tubbo> one thing though is it makes returned jQ objects look a little better in the Firebug console
[14:23:12] <fearphage> gnarf: yes and yes. your logic is correct and the elements are siblings
[14:23:24] <phishy> tubbo: Ya I recall that as well. I think it would be quite useful if it existed and worked
[14:23:27] <tubbo> phishy: however...seeing which event listeners are on an object is tough. you may have to comment out code and stuff
[14:23:46] <gnarf> ajpiano Eviltwin: overcomplicated example: http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/3/
[14:23:47] <gnarf> :)
[14:23:55] <gnarf> fearphage: okay
[14:24:05] <tubbo> phishy: you can also use debugger; to step through your code and console.log() to output vital inforamtion without blocking any actions
[14:24:09] <gnarf> fearphage: this is funky
[14:24:12] <tubbo> i rather like debugger actually
[14:24:28] <tubbo> in Chrome, you can bring up a console for the point in your code that you're in
[14:24:36] <phishy> tubbo: Indeed. I was more thinking it would be handy to see, while learning an app
[14:24:40] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Yeah, I've done that before
[14:24:43] <tubbo> so if you're in a function, all of that function's local vars become available, as well as the scope of `this`
[14:24:54] <Eviltwin> I'm actually planning to write a plugin to make these sorts of things easier
[14:25:04] <Eviltwin> Just trying to boil down to the essentails
[14:25:13] <Eviltwin> essentials*
[14:25:33] <Richhh> still no answer for this http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/3/
[14:26:47] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/4/
[14:26:54] <Eviltwin> Richhh: Use that instead ^
[14:26:59] * Richhh looks
[14:27:57] <Richhh> Eviltwin thats nice lol but still doesnt work
[14:28:53] <Eviltwin> Richhh: I'm showing you how you should structure these things when asking for help :P
[14:31:55] <fearphage> gnarf: yeah, it's pretty crazy
[14:32:03] <gnarf> fearphage: var last, pop = Array.prototype.pop, result = $( $elements );  while ( last = result.last() && !( last[0] == selected || last.is( ".catpants" ) ) ) { pop.call( result ); }
[14:32:39] <gnarf> although that might go forever without an && last.length
[14:32:55] <gnarf> but i'd prolly take that approach ^^
[14:33:39] <Eviltwin> Whoa
[14:33:41] <Eviltwin> What's this for?
[14:33:52] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/648e8ba69517505f1b9c
[14:34:25] <gnarf> Eviltwin: i said the same thing :)
[14:34:50] <fearphage> gnarf: i went with var foo = $elements.filter('.catpants:last').get(0); $elements.slice(0, foo ? Math.max($elements.index(this), $elements.index(foo)) : $elements.index(this)).map(...)
[14:34:52] <Eviltwin> Richhh: You should look at http://www.datejs.com
[14:35:28] <Shai_Tan> I have this zipcode/postcode box thingy, a postcode here in .au can be 3 or 4 numbers. This little input box takes 4 numbers, and on keyup it checks for four numbers and if we do, it does a lookup. How best to handle 3 number postcodes?
[14:35:31] <Richhh> ok Eviltwin
[14:35:36] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/7/   btw but still doesnt work
[14:35:48] * Richhh looks
[14:36:01] <gnarf> fearphage: .filter(".catpants").get(-1) should work a tad faster
[14:36:29] <gnarf> fearphage: .is can use a simple className check and sizzle doesn't need to deal with the crappy positional selectors that aren't really CSS
[14:36:51] <fearphage> i see
[14:36:54] <fearphage> thanks
[14:37:50] <ajpiano> Richhh: you need to lookup how dates work in javascript.  .getTime returns a number in milliseconds.  adding 1 to it is 1 millisecond later, not one day
[14:39:55] <Richhh> ok then i need to add (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
[14:40:30] <Richhh> but it still doesnt work
[14:40:31] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ETY/8/
[14:41:59] <Richhh> ill look into dates in js
[14:43:02] <BillCriswell> Night dudes!
[14:46:30] <Richhh> so how do i use jquery to get the date value of an input type="date" tag?
[14:46:50] <Richhh> wait got it
[14:58:31] <digitalmediaguy> Hey everyoneâ€¦ Thanks for being an awesome community in advanceâ€¦ I am having a problem making a div both dragable and resizable with the UIâ€¦ I am simply tying to append a div onclick that is both! perhaps someone could be so kind as to tell me why my div is only draggable after being appended?
[14:59:28] <Richhh> thx ajpiano and Eviltwin - goin bed now nn
[15:00:00] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/CWXwCSAN
[15:01:58] <digitalmediaguy> SORRYâ€¦ this one http://pastebin.com/0SZ7mam3
[15:03:15] <digitalmediaguy> I am trying to make my appended variable element "ele" the features likeâ€¦.  ele.draggable().resizable();
[15:05:36] <niggler> hello
[15:05:42] <digitalmediaguy> hey
[15:05:56] <niggler> is there a plan to create a lighter version of jquery?
[15:06:22] <niggler> for example, i wanted to just use the extend feature (and I ended up reimplementing it)
[15:06:34] <niggler> but it would be â€¦ nice to be able to pick and choose what's needed :)
[15:07:16] <Xgc> jquery kernel + loadable modules
[15:08:10] <TelFiRE> niggler: if you took out every single helper function you save less than 500 bytes
[15:08:47] <TelFiRE> And removing anything else would guarantee incompatibility with most plugins, so it's doubtful it will be made
[15:08:59] <TelFiRE> jQuery is already sooooo light
[15:09:02] <niggler> http://zeptojs.com/
[15:09:09] <niggler> for example
[15:09:28] <digitalmediaguy> Anyone ok with the UI draggable and resizable?
[15:09:54] <digitalmediaguy> I have been through the docâ€¦ I can make my elements draggableâ€¦. NP but non will resize?!?
[15:10:01] <digitalmediaguy> something I am missing here?
[15:10:04] <TelFiRE> niggler: it's not jQuery...
[15:10:15] <TelFiRE> if you get right down to it, anything you can do in jQuery you can do with raw javascript, but who wants to
[15:11:15] <TelFiRE> just a matter of where you draw the line. And that varies by site
[15:11:18] <silverwind> If you don't need to support older IEs... You can use raw JS and it's not that bad.
[15:11:28] <silverwind> Because of the selector apis
[15:11:52] <silverwind> s/JS/DOM
[15:12:09] <TelFiRE> but jQuery -- for its intended purpose -- is very very close to as light as possible. Making it any lighter would be making it into something other than jQuery.
[15:13:16] <TelFiRE> in the words of a popular jquery forum user "Such a spinoff, if it were to exist, will not be created by the team of folks that maintains jQuery. It wouldn't be jQuery, it would be something else. If it were called jQuery, an ever-increasing number of web developers worldwide would expect it to fulfill on a promise and a design that is different than its own, and that wouldn't benefit anyone. By contrast, it would confuse a lot of people and add to the burd
[15:13:16] <TelFiRE> supporting not just one, but both of those libraries. And for the minimal supposed benefit gained (see below), it would be extremely costly." more details here http://forum.jquery.com/topic/make-a-light-version-of-jquery-jquery-lite
[15:14:33] <silverwind> Anyway... Probably that jQ 2.0 will be a lot lighter because it won't support old browsers
[15:15:01] <TelFiRE> ... really?
[15:15:06] <TelFiRE> but that's why jQuery is usable
[15:15:35] <silverwind> I heard they'll still improve the 1.9 branch
[15:16:42] <TelFiRE> well they're going to have to
[15:16:49] <TelFiRE> because old style browsers aren't going to be gone for another 10 years
[15:17:13] <silverwind> It should be faster than that.
[15:17:16] <TelFiRE> and I don't know any developer who would be willing to use jQuery at all if it didn't support those old browsers :s
[15:17:31] <TelFiRE> silverwind: not based on past precedents by any means
[15:17:34] <silverwind> IE6 was the exception... because MS took a decade to release Vista
[15:18:19] <ajpiano> TelFiRE: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/ http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/
[15:18:26] <TelFiRE> then again, what google's doing may make quite a difference
[15:19:21] <TelFiRE> even 8 huh
[15:19:36] <TelFiRE> makes sense I guess probably all the same bugs
[15:19:48] <TelFiRE> I guess someone has to push the ball forward
[15:19:56] <TelFiRE> Just don't think they'll be dropping 1.9 any time soon heh
[15:22:34] <silverwind> The life of a IE version is strictly bound to the life of the OS it came with.
[15:22:54] <niggler> what os did ie8 come with
[15:22:59] <silverwind> Since there was a decade between the release of XP and Vista... that's why IE6 has been hell so far.
[15:23:08] <silverwind> niggler: Unfortunately... Windows 7
[15:23:09] <TelFiRE> idk if 8 ever shipped
[15:23:13] <TelFiRE> oh
[15:23:30] <TelFiRE> really? it doesn't come with 9?
[15:23:43] <silverwind> Nope, at least it wasn't when it was released.
[15:23:46] <TelFiRE> no wonder they feel the need to advertise their own damn browser so heavily
[15:23:48] <niggler> its gonna be hard to unseat XP and 7
[15:23:56] <silverwind> XP, not that much.
[15:24:08] <niggler> xp is not going away
[15:24:08] <silverwind> April 8th 2014 IIRC
[15:24:11] <niggler> unfortunately
[15:24:12] <TelFiRE> lol@vista, the biggest failure in electronic history
[15:24:50] <silverwind> niggler: That's the EOL of XP... after, if morons still want to use it... good luck with security
[15:24:53] <TelFiRE> Google is dropping support for oldIE too
[15:25:06] <TelFiRE> and they're actually doing it on all their apps regardless of whether it has features that can't be replicated
[15:25:08] <niggler> silverwind: it doesnt really work like that, unfortunately
[15:25:13] <niggler> esp in corporate situations
[15:25:16] <silverwind> Of course it does.
[15:25:30] <silverwind> Big corps cannot afford to have an unsupported OS.
[15:25:36] <TelFiRE> niggler: actually no.. in corporate situations it really does work that way.
[15:25:45] <TelFiRE> If they stop security updates, then they absolutely cannot afford to not upgrade
[15:26:06] <niggler> if the software you use isnt compatible with the next version, you arent upgrading
[15:26:08] <TelFiRE> it will EASILY cost them more money, GUARANTEED
[15:26:21] <silverwind> niggler: They had years to prepare.
[15:26:29] <TelFiRE> niggler: if your OS isn't supporte, you ARE upgrading. You're finding new software or hiring someone to port it.
[15:26:30] <silverwind> And 2 windows versions..
[15:26:55] <TelFiRE> The only reason XP has stuck around so long in the corporate environment is because M$ continues to release security updates.
[15:27:19] <silverwind> Heh... Ie6 :(
[15:27:35] <TelFiRE> When that stops happening, it isn't a question for corporations. They absolutely WILL upgrade because there's no other choice. You can't have insecure systems. Even if there's nothing major, you're GOING to get attacked often enough that it costs you more money than to just upgrade.
[15:28:00] <silverwind> The good news is that A LOT of corps never upgraded to Vista.
[15:28:12] <TelFiRE> well ofc
[15:28:16] <silverwind> So we probably won't be forced to support IE7 for a long time
[15:28:51] <TelFiRE> huh? Ie7 is way more popular than 6
[15:28:59] <TelFiRE> most people update
[15:29:22] <kingpapie> Howdy
[15:29:47] <kingpapie> Bit quiet here
[15:29:55] <TelFiRE> M$ tried to end support for XP a couple years ago and the corporations all had an uproar. All that was out was vista, no one was going to "upgrade" (read: downgrade) to vista. Since then, almost all the compatibility issues between XP and 7 is pretty much resolved. Very few apps won't run on both.
[15:30:16] <kingpapie> Cya
[15:30:19] <TelFiRE> One thing I could see happening when they finally drop XP support is a mass exodus of corporations to linux. Seeing as it's free and will always be updatesd
[15:30:39] <BinaryKitten> TelFiRE you're joking right?
[15:31:12] <TelFiRE> Yeah, hence my non-serious and totally whacked out tone.
[15:31:29] <BinaryKitten> TelFiRE sorry can't hear the tone over text
[15:31:36] <TelFiRE> I don't even know what you're referring to
[15:31:54] <TelFiRE> Ah then I guess you missed the sarcasm in that very comment.
[15:32:09] <BinaryKitten> usually that happens
[15:32:14] <BinaryKitten> usually quite often
[15:32:30] <TelFiRE> Do you actually have anything to say or did you just want to say something rude and then not even explain why or what you were referring to
[15:33:13] <BinaryKitten> TelFiRE i was referring to the mass exodus to linux. Also, i don't think i was being rude
[15:34:12] <TelFiRE> Ok, well no I wasn't joking. I can really see that happening. And if you want to argue it how about putting forth some actual argument instead of just acting like I'm a nutjob? Or maybe you just have a crystal ball to refer to
[15:34:22] <BinaryKitten> and if i came across that way, then i apologise
[15:34:46] <TelFiRE> All I'm saying is that linux is an attractive choice to corporations faced with a decision of either paying to upgrade to 7 or upgrading to linux for free
[15:35:10] <TelFiRE> And linux is already really popular in the corporate world so I don't know what's so surprising to you about that
[15:35:25] <BinaryKitten> TelFiRE i'll just stfu then. I thought you were joking, since you wern't i apologise for the misconception and will just get out.
[15:35:26] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:37:05] <TelFiRE> BinaryKitten: don't read too much into my sarcasm I was just trying to figure out why you thought it was such an absurd thought :s
[15:37:27] * BinaryKitten is tired. Long day.
[15:37:30] <TelFiRE> because to me it seems logical but it is entirely possible I'm missing a piece of the puzzle
[15:37:39] <BinaryKitten> TelFiRE, just basing it on my dealing with corps
[15:37:56] <BinaryKitten> most look at linux and see it as pointless and supportless.
[15:38:08] <BinaryKitten> especially with existing set ups
[15:38:15] <TelFiRE> BinaryKitten: well RedHat is used by a lot of the fortune 500
[15:38:33] <TelFiRE> But yes I can definitely see that attitude out there as well
[15:38:43] <BinaryKitten> alot of the ones i've dealt with will gladly get a mac than spend 1/2 hour of time installing Linux
[15:38:45] <TelFiRE> they're going to be forced to re-evaluate their positions when support drops for XP, I think
[15:39:16] <TelFiRE> But from a Corporate standpoint changing to macs means swapping out hardware, which I doubt they'll do until they have to
[15:40:03] <BinaryKitten> for a lot of the ones i deal with, they don't see/know/want to know the difference
[15:40:03] <TelFiRE> At any rate, I don't care what they do. As long as they don't keep trying to use XP after the security updates stop. But I'm sure a few hackers can quickly show the world that XP is no longer viable.
[15:40:33] <BinaryKitten> heh, XP is no longer supported by windows update
[15:40:42] <BinaryKitten> which helps a little
[15:40:48] <TelFiRE> I thought they were doing security updates till 2014
[15:41:22] <BinaryKitten> Critical updates only and last time i looked, only to those with extended support
[15:41:46] <TelFiRE> They'll know the difference when their tech guy comes to them and says "XP is no longer secure. You have three choices. Upgrade to Linux for free, Upgrade to Win7 for $20,000, or Upgrade to Macs for $200,000"
[15:42:15] <BinaryKitten> heh
[15:42:29] <BinaryKitten> i wish i had the ability to say that
[15:42:48] <TelFiRE> =p
[15:42:59] <BinaryKitten> usually get "XP says it no longer works, We have X amount of money and we want Y. Make it happen"
[15:43:25] <BinaryKitten> anyway. Time for sleep
[15:43:58] <BinaryKitten> have a good evening TelFiRE :)
[15:44:01] <TelFiRE> night

[16:01:07] <cliffer> while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { $arr[] = $row; } echo json_encode($arr); is creating an array of objects, which can be used with $.each(data, function(i, item). how is it possible to create an array with objects in it without mysql result?
[16:02:12] <cliffer> $response_inner["success"] = 0; $response_inner["message"] = "error: ".$response_text;	$response_outer[] = $response_inner; echo json_encode($response_outer); does not work
[16:02:27] <cliffer> it returns an array with string, not objects
[16:12:43] <tw2113> print() is like echo to php, right?
[16:12:54] <tw2113> or just print without the ()
[16:15:47] <tw2113> or am i thinking document.write
[16:21:42] <danheberden> tw2113: document.write does indeed write, but obliterates the current body of the document. Just append nodes to the dom using .append(), e.g. $('body').append('<p>omg</p>');
[16:22:15] <tw2113> was trying to brain up a way to get a url in a specific spot
[16:22:36] <tw2113> but i may just grab all the images in the div and then swap in an appropriate url
[16:24:02] <tw2113> thanks for the reply regardless danheberden
[16:34:23] <MistuhKurtz> tw2113, what exactly are you trying to do?
[16:34:40] <MistuhKurtz> what's the 'specific spot' ?
[16:34:57] <tw2113> part of a share link for pinterest
[16:35:14] <tw2113> i got permission to drop pinterest from the task, so i grew instantly happier
[16:35:17] <MistuhKurtz> so a text node?
[16:35:29] <tw2113> part of a $_GET parameter
[16:35:44] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[16:36:04] <tw2113> once i realized i would have to parse that aspect as well, i was all like "fuck that"
[16:51:53] <bwain> i think i found a bug in jquery ui sortables
[16:51:55] <bwain> http://jsfiddle.net/ADyhR/11/
[16:52:20] <bwain> if you switch it to jquery v 1.5 and use that version, it will work
[16:52:32] <bwain> but in jquery 1.7 and jquery ui 1.8.18, it doesnt
[17:29:54] <chare> Can someone explain to me why <div class="row"> takes up the entire width of my page: http://chesseng.herokuapp.com/
[17:30:32] <coldhead> because divs have display:block by default
[17:30:38] <coldhead> which takes all the available width
[17:30:49] <chare> so I want to do what instead?
[17:30:54] <coldhead> you need to give it display:inline or inline-block or float it
[17:31:28] <someprimetime> if you float it you're gonna need to clear it
[17:31:34] <someprimetime> or else you're gonna have a bad time
[17:31:48] <chare> ok i wish i knew what you were talking about when you say display:inline, inline-block, or float
[17:31:54] <MistuhKurtz> chare, sounds like you could stand to read up on some CSS positioning
[17:31:56] <someprimetime> chare: #css
[17:32:00] <MistuhKurtz> #css will be hlepful
[17:32:21] <coldhead> you'll be okay lil buddy!
[17:36:55] <chare> ok why did putting that div inside of <div class="container"> work?
[17:37:45] <danheberden> chare, maybe some tutorials on css will help you
[17:38:03] <danheberden> like http://www.css-101.org/ ond, you know, googling "learn css"
[17:38:09] <danheberden> s/ong/and/
[17:38:50] <chare> danheberden: i demand answers NOW
[17:39:16] <danheberden> chare, and i demand my girlfriend to bring me beer BUT I DONT ALWAYS GET IT DO I
[17:39:32] <chare> danheberden you mad that she dumpde you?
[17:39:49] <danheberden> extremely
[17:40:45] <chare> danheberden how about compromise, you answer my question and i'll read the website
[17:41:11] <coldhead> i'm finding this a bit uncomfortable, guys
[17:41:22] <coldhead> it's bringing back some painful memories
[17:41:25] <coldhead> of the time i had a beer
[17:41:31] <coldhead> i was so scared
[17:41:38] <chare> why do people drink beer anyways, it tastse HORRIBLE
[17:41:47] <danheberden> what hop'ned?
[17:42:11] <coldhead> i thought i'd gone insane and it would never end
[17:43:13] <chare> danheberden: you gonna answer my compromise?
[17:43:51] <danheberden> chare, i think i'm gonna get some dinner and a glass of bourbon instead
[17:44:01] <danheberden> and dream of coldhead's soft touch
[17:44:08] <chare> danheberden: so you saying you don't know the answer, you're a css noob
[17:44:19] <danheberden> exactly, i know not what you seek
[17:44:27] <danheberden> i only know the javascripts
[17:44:37] <coldhead> i'm not sure you even know that, danheberden
[17:44:48] <danheberden> coldhead, good point
[17:45:01] <danheberden> coldhead, my worth might be all a fantasy - oh dear
[17:46:02] <chare> coldhead: you gonna answer my question since danheberden doesn't know?
[17:46:43] <coldhead> i'd be more inclined to help out if you hadn't started calling a treasured member of our community a noob
[17:46:49] <coldhead> but now i have a very tired feeling
[17:49:18] <coldhead> chare: div class="container" has width: 940px;
[17:49:19] <coldhead> in the CSS
[17:49:35] <coldhead> so anything with "display:block" inside there is still going to take all available width
[17:49:39] <coldhead> and that width is now 940
[17:49:42] <coldhead> ?cc
[17:49:42] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:50:10] <chare> oh this is some bootstrap crap
[17:50:17] <chare> why would they default it ti 940
[17:50:35] <MistuhKurtz> lrn2css before you try using bootstrap :|
[17:50:56] <chare> 940 = magic number?
[17:51:50] <coldhead> 940 is a common maximum width that works well on lots of screens
[17:51:51] <danheberden> it's like 42, but 22.380952381 times more
[17:51:51] <chare> OK I WILL NOW READ http://www.css-101.org/
[17:51:58] <coldhead> hahahah
[17:52:24] <danheberden> you're a shining star in such a dark sky chare
[17:53:09] <coldhead> a stream of bat piss like a shaft of gold when all around is dark
[17:53:18] <chare> danheberden: uh oh I'm feeling the procrastination taking over
[17:53:51] <danheberden> coldhead, and here i thought you weren't a romantic
[17:54:36] <coldhead> is it romantic to rip off oscar wilde? i guess so
[17:54:43] <chare> too late going to play starcraft 2
[17:54:57] <chare> attention span already gone
[17:54:58] <coldhead> that's probably a better use of your time
[17:55:04] <coldhead> chess is so 4 centuries ago
[17:55:24] <chare> so in other words you saying you suck at chess
[17:57:27] <coldhead> yes chare, basically anytime anyone offers an opinion on something it means they suck at it
[17:57:33] <coldhead> and have deep feelings of inadequacy about it
[17:57:37] <coldhead> which you are brutally exposing
[17:57:42] <coldhead> like some kind of judge judy
[17:57:50] <coldhead> or doctor mukti
[17:58:00] <chare> coldhead and does your psychologist prescribe you antidepressants?
[17:58:36] <coldhead> my church doesn't allow me to use drugs
[17:59:39] <chare> so you use the church to hide your drug operations?
[17:59:57] <coldhead> that would be very improper
[18:01:32] <Shai_Tan> if I have $_COOKIE['foo'] = array('one'=>'one', 'two'=>'two'); In jquery, how do I reset 'two'?
[18:02:12] <madprops> hi, i'm trying to detect when a div has scrolled to the bottom by using bind(scroll) , but i think the scroller y is not read correctly. I have an alert with (scroller.scroll.y) and when i scroll from the top it throws 2 alerts, 0 and 0, if i keep scrolling i get 0 and some number. I want to check of it reaches the bottom which is 134, but i only get an alert with 134 if i scroll from the bottom up .. is there a way to get 134 when scrolling
[18:02:12] <madprops> down and reach the bottom?
[18:03:30] <coldhead> ?nopm @ chare
[18:03:30] <bot-t> chare, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[18:03:53] <coldhead> we can discuss my use of prostitutes here, chare. it's not exactly a private matter
[18:04:03] <chare> so you admit to it
[18:04:23] <coldhead> it's a real solution to a real problem
[18:07:10] <chare> coldhead: how much do you pay them to satisfy your sick needs
[18:08:00] <coldhead> i am not usually involved in that side of the transaction, chare. my carers negotiate it all
[18:08:11] <coldhead> i just have to turn up, wearing my onesy and a specially located bow
[18:09:25] <pifantastic> madprops: jsfiddle?
[18:12:28] <docmur> Is it possible to put icons in my autocomplete results, I'm thinking I would like to put a plus and minus icon beside each result
[18:12:53] <chare> coldhead: when i drag around a black chess piece it renders underneath the white pieces, rather than search about this, i'm going to let you spoon feed me the answer
[18:12:57] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to detect if a device is capable of making a phone call?
[18:13:24] <pifantastic> docmur: yes
[18:14:04] <docmur> Okay so what would be the method of doing that, I already have a list with results in it so what would I have to edit / add to include the icons
[18:14:11] <Shai_Tan> whats wrong with this? -> jQuery.cookie('gold[postcode]', '2345', { path: '/', expires: 5000000 });
[18:14:49] <pifantastic> BillCriswell: The only way I know is user agent
[18:14:58] <pifantastic> BillCriswell: but that comes with its own set of baggage
[18:15:16] <BillCriswell> pifantastic: Yeah, that's looking like the only option.
[18:15:26] <pifantastic> Shai_Tan: It looks fine to me
[18:15:46] <pifantastic> docmur: each auto complete item is just an <li> containing an <a> tag
[18:15:51] <Shai_Tan> do I need a cookie plugin or something?
[18:15:56] <pifantastic> docmur: use CSS to your heart's desire
[18:16:00] <pifantastic> Shai_Tan: yes
[18:16:05] <Shai_Tan> aha!
[18:16:12] <pifantastic> Shai_Tan: jQuery does not come with a cookie method, you need the cookie plugin
[18:16:32] <docmur> Right so I would put that in the open() method?
[18:16:36] <Shai_Tan> this one? -> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[18:17:01] <coldhead> chare: you need a higher z-index for the piece you are moving
[18:17:46] <BillCriswell> pifantastic: I was hoping there was something going on with the event object.
[18:17:58] <BillCriswell> but it's not looking good.

[18:18:12] <kaputtmacher> hi all
[18:18:42] <coldhead> A PROFOUND WEARINESS
[18:18:52] <imsky> A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
[18:18:55] <pifantastic> docmur: I think so, yes
[18:19:08] <kaputtmacher> i'm trying to figure out how to access the cycle-slide-active of cycle2 plugin within the cycle-after event
[18:20:21] <kaputtmacher> i want my slideshow to cycle  through images using cycle2 plugin from malsup, and after a slide faded in i want it to change it's positioning f.e. left -50px
[18:21:48] <MistuhKurtz> hmm cycle2
[18:22:00] <kaputtmacher> if i run my jquery code from chrome console , my image moves accordingly to the left.. but it does not only from the event
[18:22:03] <Shai_Tan> pifantastic: thanks
[18:23:02] <kaputtmacher> $('img.cycle-slide-active').animate({ left : "-30" },2000); works from chrome console
[18:24:01] <chare> god why does css feel as painful as win32 api
[18:24:20] <kaputtmacher> are there any restrictions when to use animate ?
[18:28:23] <pifantastic> kaputtmacher: are you sure that when you run your animate(), the selector is matching something?
[18:28:54] <kaputtmacher> i am
[18:29:01] <kaputtmacher> wanna try on your own ?
[18:29:14] <pifantastic> kaputtmacher: sure
[18:29:24] <kaputtmacher> run the mentioned command here in console: http://dev.rsmgermany.webseiten.cc/
[18:29:53] <kaputtmacher> you see the images moving ?
[18:31:04] <pifantastic> kaputtmacher: yup
[18:31:31] <pifantastic> wtf is this? $(incomingSlideEl).animate(Array,2000);
[18:31:50] <kaputtmacher> incomingSlideEl is the slide which comes next
[18:32:00] <kaputtmacher> got it from the api
[18:32:05] <kaputtmacher> please refresh
[18:32:12] <kaputtmacher> cleaned up the js code..
[18:32:20] <pifantastic> Array?
[18:32:23] <pifantastic> why do you have that?
[18:32:30] <pifantastic> instead of { left : "-30" }
[18:32:56] <kaputtmacher> damnit
[18:33:12] <pifantastic> I think that's your problem :P
[18:33:12] <kaputtmacher> probably this is the solution
[18:33:28] <kaputtmacher> this is typo3 with a fluid (templating engine) based theme
[18:33:45] <kaputtmacher> fluid uses a lot of { x : y } stuff
[18:33:54] <kaputtmacher> need to escape that one
[18:34:40] <pifantastic> Also, should be { left : "-30px" }
[18:36:04] <kaputtmacher> escaped the {} stuff .. seems to work partially
[18:36:20] <kaputtmacher> thx for pointing me to the right direction
[18:36:26] <pifantastic> np
[18:36:34] <kaputtmacher> quite late to fix that slideshow.. 4.am atm..
[18:36:55] <pifantastic> it's the life of a web programmer
[18:37:00] <kaputtmacher> hehe
[18:38:46] <jmar777> argh - can anyone confirm this bug in chrome (browser bug that is, not jquery)? http://jsfiddle.net/VVHaY/
[18:39:15] <jmar777> specifically the jittering along the right side of the expanding element in #test-2?  seems to be chrome only
[18:40:14] <pifantastic> jmar777: they all look fine in 22.0.1229.91 beta
[18:40:53] <jmar777> pifantastic: hm... good news then. i'm running 22.0.1229.79 (stable)
[18:41:31] <jmar777> pifantastic: it's oddly specific. right-aligned absolutely positioned elements with an animated width inside of some "margin:auto" centered container...
[18:41:40] <chare> jmar777, all i see is a cup being filled with piss, no jitter on  22.0.1229.79 linux
[18:42:11] <jmar777> chare: hmm... wonder if it's chrome specific. it's a VERY subtle jittering. like a single pixel on the right side of the second test case
[18:42:20] <jmar777> chare: sorry, meant chrome + osx specific
[18:42:30] <chare> why the hell you paying for your operating system?
[18:43:42] <jmar777> chare: hm.. i could either go "i wanted a decent video card/driver" route, or "i'm not, the boss is...". choose your own adventure :)
[18:44:12] <chare> look we all know that real hackers use internet explorer 6
[18:44:26] <jmar777> chare: ;)
[18:44:42] <imsky> real hackers use ie5.5
[18:44:42] <jmar777> so... seriously absolutely NO jittering on the right side?
[18:45:29] <chare> nothing
[18:45:42] <jmar777> chare: k. thanks
[18:46:10] <chare> you need to turn on antialiasing on your video card or something
[18:46:59] <jmar777> chare: pretty sure it's not that. chrome is doing a weird "expand, then shift" with a paint in the middle. but only in that very specific situation
[19:02:53] <coldhead> ryry noo
[19:03:17] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: it's okay I'm still here
[19:03:22] <ryanneufeld> had to ghost my other login
[19:03:39] <coldhead> whew
[19:03:59] <ryanneufeld> I know right?
[20:04:38] <Shai_Tan> jQuery('#gold_estimate_shipping_message').text("new text");
[20:04:56] <Shai_Tan> should this replace the text in the span with the id #gold_estimate_shipping_message?
[20:08:51] <cosm> is this the right place to ask for any plugins that allow for multiple sticky elements per page, that go from relative > fixed > relative again while scrolling down?
[20:10:16] <gnarf> cosm: i can't speak from experience, but scrollorama is something I've seen suggested
[20:10:19] <gnarf> http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/
[20:11:04] <cosm> nice, this is the first i've seen that does the stick/unstickâ€¦thanks!
[20:19:22] <Jagst3r15> when the slide goes to the next one any idea why it gets spazzy on the left side? http://jagst3r15.com/
[20:19:37] <Jagst3r15> just seeing if anyone knows not that dire of an issue'
[20:29:28] <rgenito_> herro everyone

[20:35:51] <niggler> 'herro'
[20:36:05] <rgenito_> heyyy i have a fish named niggler :)
[20:36:13] <rgenito_> and the other's name is nigglette
[20:36:37] <rgenito_> niggler, i have no idea what you're talkin about soooo...sorry! :)
[20:37:02] <niggler> hehe
[20:37:22] <niggler> 'herro' references the chinese r/l issue
[20:37:25] <niggler> like engrish
[20:37:46] <rgenito_> yes, it does :D
[20:37:52] <rgenito_> oh rearry?
[20:37:54] <rgenito_> jk
[20:38:24] <Jagst3r15> fuck you motherfucker
[20:39:28] <rgenito_> wow, this jquery chat is spicy!
[20:40:33] <niggler> fuck jquery
[20:40:40] <niggler> actually that's not true
[20:40:54] <niggler> what are some exemplary uses of jquery
[20:42:10] <Jagst3r15> u are in over your head
[20:42:14] <Jagst3r15> k
[20:46:48] <gnarf> ....
[20:47:31] <pifantastic> ahru: do you have a jsfiddle to reproduce?
[20:47:43] <ahru> que?
[20:47:54] <pifantastic> ahru: the issue you have finding the table row
[20:48:05] <pifantastic> also, niggler, could you maybe change your nick?
[20:48:26] <niggler> pifantastic what about you?
[20:49:05] <pifantastic> niggler: I doubt mine could be interpreted as offensive
[20:51:01] <niggler> that's your imagination
[20:52:17] <madprops> i'm trying to append a piece of html string to a div. I get the string through ajax and i access it through data['pms'] yet when i try to append it to a div it throws NOT_FOUND_ERR dom 8 in the console .. how can I fix that?
[20:53:03] <pifantastic> madprops: you're probably trying to append it to an element that doesn't exist anymore or something
[20:53:57] <madprops> pifantastic, but it does exist, if I try to append to it in another function it does fine ... the  difference is that in one im using a full data variable .. and the other is a data['pms'] array
[20:54:23] <madprops> one is a json response the other isn't
[20:54:44] <ahru> pifantastic: should be like this http://pastebin.com/3TM0h6eN
[20:57:10] <blendedbychris> how can i run a function after this is doneâ€¦. Â Â Â Â something like Â Â Â $provider.after($provider.clone()).run(foo)
[20:57:17] <madprops> fixed it by turning it a string
[20:57:35] <blendedbychris> doesn't look like i have call in this version of jquer
[20:58:02] <blendedbychris> 1.7.1
[20:58:07] <astropirate> Hello friends
[20:59:08] <gnarf> blendedbychris: after() is a sync op
[20:59:17] <gnarf> why not just call a function after you call it?
[20:59:24] <blendedbychris> ya just realzie tat :(
[20:59:25] <blendedbychris> thanks
[21:03:53] <defaultro> hey folks, we have a class header-link and we use prepend to add another class as well as href="#". It works very well on our QA server. It also works on my officemate's local webserver setup. However, on my own setup, it doesn't work. I firebug it and I found out that when it gets executed, my browser wasn't showing anything yet. In QA server when I firebug it, when it executes it, the webpage is shown already. What's w
[21:03:53] <defaultro> rong with my setup?
[21:04:37] <defaultro> it's the same code from svn
[21:05:12] <pifantastic> ahru: http://jsfiddle.net/cYmYA/
[21:05:15] <pifantastic> ahru: that works for me
[21:07:30] <pifantastic> defaultro: is it a cross domain issue?
[21:07:39] <pifantastic> defaultro: are you relying on an ajax request?
[21:07:56] <pifantastic> defaultro: you may need to set up an alias in your hosts file
[21:07:57] <defaultro> no, it's really a simple load
[21:08:13] <defaultro> it doesn't have to do anything with other hosts
[21:08:35] <pifantastic> defaultro: your explanation is vague. What does "it gets executed" refer to?
[21:08:58] <pifantastic> defaultro: also, prepend is for DOM elements, doesn't deal with classes
[21:09:15] <defaultro> I placed breakpoint on the prepend command. When I was doing it against the server and when it was on the prepend line, my browser was showing the webpage. However, when I was viewing my localhost webserver, my browser was blank
[21:09:23] <defaultro> let me paste the code
[21:11:40] <defaultro> http://pastebin.com/Qu8GRw6Z
[21:13:01] <pifantastic> defaultro: does this code run after $(document).ready ?
[21:13:02] <defaultro> I placed a breakpoint on that code in Firebug. When Firebug detects and before I continue, I see the webpage. That means, the information I need which is the header-links is there
[21:13:19] <defaultro> I don't see that code
[21:13:39] <defaultro> but it works very well on QA server and my colleages machine but not on my local apache
[21:13:42] <pifantastic> defaultro: it's possible that this code is executing before the .header-links element exists
[21:13:58] <defaultro> you are correct, that's what I noticed. And I was wondering why it's doing that
[21:13:59] <ahru> pifantastic: current code has $('#test1 tbody tr').click(function() {});
[21:14:10] <pifantastic> ahru: that will not work
[21:14:15] <ahru> ye
[21:14:21] <pifantastic> ahru: that is binding an event to an element that does not exist yet
[21:14:22] <ahru> so I used the one you used
[21:14:30] <defaultro> that's that I was trying to explain earlier :)
[21:14:41] <defaultro> so why does it happen on my machine only?
[21:15:14] <pifantastic> defaultro: maybe your local server is faster so your DOM ready event fires sooner
[21:15:27] <defaultro> k
[21:15:31] <pifantastic> defaultro: does waiting for $(document).ready fix the problem?
[21:15:41] <defaultro> I haven't tried adding that code
[21:15:57] <defaultro> maybe index.php is cauasing it
[21:16:01] <defaultro> let me svn update it
[21:16:06] <pifantastic> http://pastebin.com/XXrRusK2
[21:16:08] <blendedbychris> sv what?
[21:16:28] <defaultro> i'll try that code
[21:16:37] <defaultro> why isn't $(document).ready?
[21:16:44] <defaultro> is it the same?
[21:18:16] <webBuilder> hello friend I have a code that uses animation and it works only the first time then wont work?  any help please http://jsfiddle.net/pTx5v/
[21:18:49] <defaultro> pifantastic,, your code fixed it!
[21:18:53] <defaultro> :)
[21:19:41] <pifantastic> defaultro: Make sure you know the DOM is ready before you start trying to interact with it
[21:19:53] <defaultro> looks like my machine is too fast
[21:20:05] <defaultro> like what you said. Maybe my officemate's machine is slow
[21:20:18] <defaultro> i hope my officemate won't complain why I added it
[21:20:29] <defaultro> and I think it's even safer and sure if I add that
[21:21:32] <pifantastic> defaultro: you absolutely need it
[21:21:39] <defaultro> cool
[21:24:18] <defaultro> is $(function() different from $(document).ready ?
[21:24:29] <systemfault> Same thing
[21:24:34] <defaultro> cool
[21:24:58] <defaultro> i commited the code ;)
[21:25:03] <defaultro> thanks for your help
[21:25:18] <webBuilder> hey
[21:25:30] <webBuilder> where is my help I'm jealous
[21:25:43] <webBuilder> why animate works only the first time
[21:27:02] <coldhead> can you do a better demo, webBuilder?
[21:27:07] <coldhead> i can't see it failing here
[21:27:11] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination
[21:27:21] <webBuilder> coldhead, I try but didn't work
[21:27:26] <webBuilder> coldhead,  okay then I'll do it
[21:27:31] <webBuilder> give me few sec please
[21:27:33] <defaultro> glad to see you again coldhead :)
[21:28:03] <coldhead> defaultro: always a pleasure
[21:28:25] <vladikoff> webBuilder, also you might be looking for "left: '+=50' instead of something like "left:50" , += would keep animating (adding 50 pixels )
[21:30:44] <ahru> and pifantastic before I forget, thank you for your help
[21:31:09] <pifantastic> ahru: np
[21:31:16] <coldhead> aw
[21:31:19] <EYES> nope.
[21:33:38] <defaultro> btw folks, why did my officemate use bindfirst("click"....... rather than just doing .click(.....?
[21:34:17] <defaultro> form.find('#saveButton').bindFirst("click", {}, saveClick);
[21:34:28] <coldhead> https://github.com/private-face/jquery.bind-first Attach handler to an event and it will be executed first, regardless of how many ones you had already attached.
[21:34:45] <defaultro> and not form.find("#saveButton).click(.....
[21:35:51] <defaultro> got it
[21:36:03] <webBuilder> vladikoff, where do you see anything that said left:50 ?
[21:36:26] <vladikoff> webBuilder, i saw top: and bottom:
[21:36:39] <defaultro> so bind-first is a plugin? How is it called?
[21:38:54] <nights> hm
[21:39:22] <webBuilder> vladikoff, so you are saying to change it to top:50 to top+=50 ?
[21:39:50] <vladikoff> webBuilder, depends on your animation
[21:39:53] <webBuilder> coldhead, here is the demo for some reason is not working on jsfpaddle http://www.designzzz.com/image-effects-slider-tutorials-jquery/
[21:40:18] <webBuilder> vladikoff, the demo is whre I post it above for them it works probably because they have only one single image
[21:40:20] <nights> anyone know why scrollTop() only works if accessed through $(window).scroll(function() ?
[21:40:24] <webBuilder> I have multiple images and is not working
[21:40:31] <nights> when i try to access it from a click, it doesnt work :(
[21:40:51] <webBuilder> coldhead, vladikoff, here is the exact demo http://www.queness.com/resources/html/caption/index.html
[21:42:36] <webBuilder> vladikoff, the animation works but it works only the first time the second time I do onhover its just fast doesn't do anything
[21:42:46] <webBuilder> it looks ugly without the animation
[21:44:43] <nights> is this syntax valid?
[21:44:43] <nights> $(".bs-docs-sidenav").wait(2sec).click(function(e){
[21:45:20] <coldhead> ?eval 2sec
[21:45:23] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[21:45:29] <coldhead> no, 2sec is not valid
[21:45:56] <nights> coldhead: ok but is $(".bs-docs-sidenav").wait(2000).click(function(e){
[21:45:58] <nights> valid?
[21:46:11] <nights> i mean the general procedure of putting a wait after the selector
[21:46:42] <defaultro> coldhead, what is the advantage of having a class with bindFirst especially when it's executed first?
[21:47:57] <coldhead> nights: you might be looking for delay()
[21:47:59] <coldhead> ?delay
[21:48:00] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:48:24] <coldhead> defaultro: if you have an huge number of event handlers you might want a particular one to run first
[21:48:33] <defaultro> got it
[21:48:34] <coldhead> particularly if it controls whether or not to let the others run
[21:48:38] <pifantastic> nights: I don't see how it makes sense at all to have any sort of wait or delay after selecting an element
[21:48:42] <coldhead> its probably a sign you have too many handlers
[21:48:53] <defaultro> k
[21:48:55] <coldhead> i don't like to write handlers that are sensitive to the order they run in
[21:49:10] <coldhead> pifantastic++ with the truth bombs
[21:49:19] <defaultro> i think I understand now why he did that. We inserted our code to another team's code
[21:49:24] <nights> coldhead: is it possible to execute delay synchronously?
[21:49:30] <defaultro> sometimes, the other team's listener captures our events
[21:49:36] <coldhead> ?mdc settimeout @ nights
[21:49:41] <bot-t> nights, window.setTimeout | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function or executes a code snippet after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[21:49:43] <coldhead> come on bot-t
[21:49:46] <pifantastic> ?xy @ nights
[21:49:47] <bot-t> nights, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[21:49:53] <nights> guess i need to use timeout
[21:49:58] <coldhead> ?csb3 @ pifantastic
[21:49:59] <bot-t> pifantastic, http://i.imgur.com/X7DSh.jpg
[21:50:15] <pifantastic> ?slap coldhead

[21:50:23] <coldhead> ?fweep @ pifantastic
[21:50:23] <pifantastic> ?hug coldhead
[21:50:24] <bot-t> pifantastic, OGGOCK
[21:50:24] <bot-t> /me hugs coldhead! <3
[21:50:30] <coldhead> aw thanks bot-t
[21:50:34] * coldhead hugs bot-t
[21:50:35] * bot-t hugs coldhead back
[21:50:42] <coldhead> it's the most love ever
[21:51:04] <nights> coldhead: i want to execute  following snippet:  if ($(window).scrollTop() > 120) $(".affix").addClass("affix-floating"); else $(".affix").removeClass("affix-floating");    problem is that scrollTop isnt updated by the time i run this, seems like the click is executed before the browser actually updates the scrollTop ...
[21:51:46] <coldhead> i'd use a setTimeout for that
[21:52:01] <coldhead> or you could bind to the scroll event
[21:52:26] <nights> coldhead: oh, bind to the scroll event sounds good
[21:52:39] <nights> i will look into that
[21:52:49] <coldhead> that might still burn you because it might fire while the scroll is happening
[21:52:59] <coldhead> but you should be able to figure something out
[21:53:49] <nights> hmm
[21:53:50] <nights> right
[21:53:52] <nights> thanks
[21:53:56] <solo> Is there any specific reason $("#groups").val() is converting my POST parameter to an array? Example: $.post("foo", { page: $("#x").val() }
[21:54:18] <solo> page is being sent as page[]: ValueReturned
[21:54:25] <webBuilder> coldhead, need your help I kind of understood my mistake
[21:55:02] <coldhead> can you show us the HTML as well, solo ?
[21:55:08] <webBuilder> how can I can change a code like this "$(document).ready(function () {...." to be called by a specific function
[21:56:03] <nights> coldhead: is this accessable within the scope of a click function btw? $(window).scrollTop()
[21:56:08] <webBuilder> becuase I want to be able to call the function with onhover="callMe()" in stead of $(document).ready(function () {.... for I have already a function like that
[21:56:10] <nights> or is it only accessable on $(window).scroll(function()
[21:56:17] <solo> coldhead: <select id="groups"> <options>.... ***** I'm getting value through $("#groups").val();
[21:57:37] <coldhead> nights: it should be assessible anywhere
[21:57:50] <coldhead> webBuilder: just remove the $(document).ready() bit and give the function a name
[21:57:58] <coldhead> function some_crazy_name () {...
[21:58:26] <coldhead> solo: do the <option>s have weird arraylike values?
[21:58:32] <webBuilder> coldhead, I knew you going to say that, I did but when I do that become faster
[21:58:42] <webBuilder> I mean it works the first time then it wont :(
[21:59:42] <solo> coldhead: Nope.
[22:00:02] <coldhead> solo: http://jsfiddle.net/5Lhsv/
[22:00:08] <coldhead> that... doesn't do anything very weird for me
[22:00:30] <nights> coldhead: so a timeout actually works. but time value has to be set relatively high. 5 doesnt work while 25 does
[22:00:35] <nights> pretty interesting
[22:01:00] <nights> 10 is ok too :)
[22:01:27] <coldhead> you should test that on a lot of browsers, nights :)
[22:01:32] <nights> ah, yes
[22:01:38] <nights> guess on IE it would be 10000
[22:01:49] <rsumi> is there a way to get all the events associated with the click() event of an element?
[22:02:48] <coldhead> rsumi: there is http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[22:02:53] <coldhead> you can steal the way it does it
[22:03:01] <coldhead> but i'm not sure it works with the latest jqueries
[22:03:12] <rsumi> ty
[22:05:39] <solo> coldhead: May have found the issue..uno momento.
[22:08:17] <coldhead> godspeed you, sir
[22:08:22] <solo> coldhead:  <select id="groups" multiple="multiple">
[22:09:06] <coldhead> AH!
[22:09:07] <solo> Wasn't aware that it would return an array if it was multiple. That is the problem, but a bad problem, I need it as multiple.
[22:09:09] <coldhead> i have never used that
[22:09:13] <coldhead> well diagnosed
[22:12:07] <phonebook_> hi jquery, i come in peace.
[22:12:33] <prishabh> then go to hell :D
[22:12:58] <phonebook_> i like your style prishabh

[22:13:26] <phonebook_> to some in the #jQuery sphere i am known as a drunk troll
[22:13:48] <phonebook_> but who isnt
[22:13:51] <phonebook_> on with the question
[22:14:12] <solo> coldhead: stored it var param = $("#id").val();     ------------ { page : param[0] } --does the trick..thanks for the help later jQuery folks.
[22:14:49] <phonebook_> i'ts really a jquery mobile question. jquery mobile adds :hover to its buttons. i made my own control with their buttons but i dont want the :hover to happen on of the buttons (which is no longer a button)
[22:15:00] <phonebook_> before you answer....
[22:15:49] <phonebook_> ive tried an anti-class. ive tried using computedStyles from the desired state. ive tried just putting a div over it
[22:15:56] <phonebook_> have spent about 15 hours on this
[22:17:10] <phonebook_> a full explanation is here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12720517/is-there-a-good-way-to-override-hover-done-by-frameworks
[22:17:22] <phonebook_> related links are available if you are interested

[22:47:58] <rsumi> i want to attach a function to be executed as soon as an element is in the visible area of the users web browser. does query have something like this built in?

[23:43:09] <Lucky--> http://burritob0t.com/ mmm open source
[23:45:39] <anew_> how are you guys directly editing the js files in console?  if i type in things like console.log i cant see variable values in console?
[23:46:04] <danheberden> chrome lets you directly edit js files in the sources panel
[23:46:42] <anew_> danheberden yes but everytime i type in an edit (for example console.log) it never prints it out ?
[23:46:54] <danheberden> do you save?
[23:47:00] <danheberden> cmnd-s/ctrl-s
[23:47:20] <danheberden> at least you used to have to do that - i haven't used chrome to do that in a while
[23:47:50] <anew_> hmmm
[23:47:54] <anew_> ok thanks danheberden
[23:48:29] <anew_> this might sound like a stupid question - but do u have to save ?
[23:49:08] <anew_> what if u want to console.log someone elses site
[23:49:48] <danheberden> anew_: if you make changes in the source panel to the js file, like, as you're typing - press cmnd-S (or cntrol-s on a pc)
[23:49:51] <danheberden> to apply those changes
[23:50:45] <anew_> danheberden.... ok very stupid question, say i go to your website and i want to console.log a variable on your site, in the console panel is this possible.   i know that with css it is
[23:53:56] <chord> what is the simplest way to make a rectangle with a little triangle coming off of it, as in like a popup when you click on a button
